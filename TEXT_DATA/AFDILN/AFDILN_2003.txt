MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME. THE WINDS 
HAVE BEEN STEADILY DECREASING AFTER SUNSET. HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
ACROSS THE REGION WILL MOVE EAST OVERNIGHT AND SOME SCATTERED HIGH 
CLOUDS MAY MOVE INTO FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. WILL UPDATE ZONES FOR 
A MINOR CHANGE IN WORDING TO WIND FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AS WINDS WILL 
BE MAINLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT. OTHERWISE...NO

CLEAR SKIES ACROSS FA THIS AFTERNOON. COULD SEE A FEW CI DRIFT INTO 
AREA OVERNIGHT BUT FOR THE MOST PART THINK SKIES WILL REMAIN CLEAR 
TO MOSTLY CLEAR AS SURFACE HIGHS PUSHES EAST ACROSS AREA. WITH WINDS 
GOING LIGHT AND VARIABLE...SHOULD SEE PRETTY GOOD RAD COOLING 
TONIGHT AND WILL UNDERCUT GUID TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO FOR LOWS. 

LOW LEVEL FLOW SWINGS AROUND TO THE SOUTHWEST ON BACKSIDE OF HIGH 
THROUGH THE DAY ON THURSDAY WITH WAA DEVELOPING ACROSS AREA. WEAK 
SHOT OF ISENT LIFT FORECAST TO LIFT NORTH ACROSS AREA DURING THE 
AFTERNOON BUT THIS ACCOMPANIED MAINLY BY MID LEVEL MOISTURE SO THINK 
WILL JUST SEE SOME CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. A LITTLE BETTER ISENT 
LIFT DEVELOPS THURSDAY EVENING AS MID LEVEL S/W FORECAST TO PUSH 
ACROSS AREA. THIS COINCIDES WITH DEEPER MOISTURE PUSHING IN THROUGH 
THE EVENING...SO WILL GO AHEAD AND BUMP POPS UP INTO THE LIKELY 
CATEGORY FOR FRIDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. 

GFS PUSHING THINGS OUT OF AREA BY FRIDAY MORNING WHILE ETA A LITTLE 
SLOWER...POSSIBLY HANGING ON TO A LITTLE PCPN ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST 
INTO FRIDAY MORNING. MEANWHILE...BOTH ETA AND GFS SHOWING ANOTHER 
SHOT OF ISENT LIFT DEVELOPING FROM THE SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON ON FRIDAY. WILL GENERALLY GO WITH A 20-30 POP FOR FRIDAY 
AND TRY TO SHOW SOME TIMING...PARTICULARLY IN THE GRIDS. 

IN WAA PATTERN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...HAVE NUDGED UP TEMPS A 
BIT FOR HIGHS BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  JGL

CURRENT SAT PIX SHOWING JUST SOME CI TO THE N OF FCST AREA TODAY. CU 
RULE IS CLEAR THOUGH THE GFS MODEL IS SHOWING SOME INCREASED H8 
MOISTURE OVER ERN FCST AREA LATER THIS AFTERNOON. DONT THINK THAT 
AVAILABLE MOISTURE WILL SEE ANY LIFTING MECHANISM FOR CLOUD 
FORMATION. 

WITH FULL SUN IN MIND, ILN SOUNDING WOULD MIX TO 920 MB AND GIVE US 
A HIGH OF 51 DEGREES. THIS IS IN LINE WITH CURRENT FCST AND NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES EXPECTED ASIDE FROM GOING SUNNY TODAY ACROSS 
FCST AREA. WINDS SHOULD DIMINISH THIS AFTERNOON AS 40KT H8 JETLET 
OVER WRN LERI MOVES NORTHEAST AND WIND MAXIMA DROPS TO 25-30KT OVER 
MUCH OF FCST AREA AT THIS LEVEL. MAX TEMPS SHOULD APPROACH FWC 
GUIDANCE WHICH IS THE MID RANGE BETWEEN COOLER GFS AND WARMER ETA.

CURRENT SFC ANALYSIS INDCG SFC HI PRES CENTERED OVER CNTRL

AND WEST INTO CNTRL PLAINS.  AC/CI ASSOCD AHEAD OF FRNTL BNDRY MOVNG 
INTO FCST AREA FROM NORTH AND WEST ATTM.

ONLY BIG ISSUE REGARDING FORECAST TODAY CENTERS AROUND AMOUNT OF 
CLOUDS AS WEAK FRNTL BNDRY DROPS INTO REGION LATER THIS MRNG.  
ETA/GFS REMAIN FAIRLY CONSISTENT OVER LAST FEW RUNS IN PUSHING BNDRY 
INTO FCST AREA BY ERLY AFTN AND WASHING IT OUT.  BEST DYNAMICS WITH 
THIS SYSTEM WILL REMAIN WELL TO OUR NORTH WITH S/WV TRACKING ACROSS 
NRN GRT LKS.  UPR LVL ZONAL FLO KEEPING THIS SYSTEM MOISTURE 
STARVED...AND EXPECT ONLY MID/HI LVL CLOUDS TO AFFECT NRN FCST AREA

IND TO CHILLICOTHE LINE WITH MSTLY SUNY SKIES FURTHER SOUTH.  DECENT 
LO LVL WIND PROFILE UP TO 850 MB AHEAD OF FRNTL BNDRY...WITH 40+ KT 
WINDS AT 925 MB.  SHOULD NOT HAVE ANY PROBLEM MIXING SOME OF THESE 
WINDS TO SFC...ESPECIALLY THRU MID AFTN.  WILL INDICATE BRISK WINDS 
AS A RESULT.

SFC HI PRES RIDGE REESTABLISHES ITSELF OVERNIGHT WITH MSTLY CLR 
SKIES.  2004 TO BEGIN QUIETLY ACRS OH VALLEY...BUT GENERAL TREND FOR THURS 
WILL BE A STEADY INCREASE IN AC/CI AS MID LVL S/WV APPCHS FROM CNTRL

LIFT DVLPG BY 00Z FRI.  FOR NOW HAVE KEPT PCPN OUT OF FCST UNTIL 
EVNG...WITH 30/40 POPS THURS NIGHT. BOTH ETA/GFS NOW INDCG S/WV WILL 
SHEAR OUT AND SHIFT EAST BY 12Z FRI WITH SOME DRYING ACRS REGION 
DURING DAY ON FRI.  290-295K ISENT LIFT HOLDS ACRS FCST AREA 
FRI...BUT NO MAJOR FORCING MECHANISM.  HAVE LOWERED POPS A BIT BASED 
ON THIS THINKING...BUT DO NOT WANT TO PULL THEM COMPLETELY.  
CONSIDERING INCONSISTENCY MODELS HAVE HAD OVER LAST FEW DAYS WITH 
THIS PATTERN...LO CHC POPS REMAIN WARRANTED.  ISENT LIFT STRENGTHENS 
FRI NIGHT AHEAD OF FRNTL BNDRY TRACKING OUT OF PLAINS STATES.  
SLOWLY RAISE POPS TO HIGH CHC BY 12Z SAT.

TEMPS...00Z MODEL RUNS GENERALLY A BIT WARMER IN LOW LVLS THAN PREV 
RUNS.  MAV GUID TOO COLD TODAY AND HAVE TRENDED AFTN HIGHS TOWARDS 
FWC GUID.  THURS HIGHS SHOULD BE CLOSE TO TODAY WITH BNDRY LYR

WITH WARM PUNCH FRI SUGGESTING HIGHS AROUND 60.  HAVE TRENDED UP

LKLY TO HOLD INTO FIRST PART OF SUN.  NEEDLESS TO SAY...FIRST

ALONG FRNTL BNDRY SAT AND SUN...AND WOULD NOT BE SHOCKED TO SEE A 
FEW TSTMS DVLP.  FOR NOW HAVE LEFT TSTMS OUT OF FCST.  RAISED TO 50 
POPS FOR MUCH OF WEEKEND.  COLDER AIR DROPPING DOWN A BIT SLOWER 
BEHIND FRNT...AND LOOKING LIKE POTENTIAL FOR MIXING PCPN OR -SN

AT 18Z...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY DEPICTED A VIGOROUS S/WV NEAR THE

JUST TO THE W OF OUR CWFA WILL BRING A 100 POP EVENT TO THE CWFA 
THIS EVENING.

BOTH GFS AND ETA SHOW LOW LVL CONV TO COUPLE WITH 250 MB UPR DIV (RR 
QUAD OF JET).  THUS...WIDESPREAD SHOWERS WILL OCCUR THIS EVENING IN 
ALL LOCATIONS.  THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE WRN CWFA

WILL BE SOME POST-FRONTAL SHOWERS (LASTING ABOUT 2 HOURS)...SO PCPN

SOUNDING SHOW THAT PCPN WILL END BEFORE AIRMASS IS COLD ENOUGH TO 
SUPPORT SNOW.  THUS...MIXED OR FROZEN PCPN IS NOT EXPECTED WITH THIS

ON TUESDAY...POST-FRONTAL STRATOCUMULUS SHOULD QUICKLY MOVE N AND E

.SHORT TERM...
AT 18Z...SFC WX MAP DEPICTED AN OCCLUDED FRONT OVER THE UPR MS 
VLY...THEN A STATIONARY FRONT ACRS THE MID MS VLY...THEN A COLD 
FRONT ACRS THE SRN PLAINS.  THE COLD FRONT WILL BE THE MAIN WX 
PLAYER OVER THE NXT 24 TO 36 HRS.

WITH A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED FLOW PATTER AT 500 MB (I.E. RIDGE OVER 
EASTERN U. S. AND H5 TROF OVER THE MIDDLE U. S.)...THE 
AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT WILL REMAIN MOSTLY PARALLEL TO THE MID LVL 
SW FLOW...AND THUS...WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON. 
THE COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN A QUICKER PROGRESSION TO THE EAST ONCE AN 
EMBEDDED S/WV EJECTS OUT OF THE SWRN U. S. INTO THE MID MS VLY 
MONDAY AFTERNOON...THEN INTO THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VLY MONDAY NIGHT. 
AS OF THE RESULT OF THE SLOW PROGRESSION...THERE SHOULD BE A TIGHT 
GRADIENT IN CHC/S OF PCPN TONIGHT INTO MONDAY AFTERNOON...WITH THE 
GREATEST THREAT OVER THE WESTERN AREAS.  THE BEST CHC FOR PCPN WILL 
BE LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS THE FRONT TRAVERSES THE 
REGION.  AT THIS TIME...THE BEST UPR DIV FROM 250 MB (ASSOCIATED 
WITH A NE PIVOTING JET..I.E. RR QUAD) WILL COMBINE WITH 
FRONTOGENETICAL MID LVL FORCING/WARM...MOIST CONVEYOR BELT. 70 TO 90 
POPS WILL BE EMPLOYED ATTM.

PCPN SHOULD QUICKLY COME TO AN END AFTER MIDNIGHT MONDAY NIGHT 
BEHIND S/WV WITH SIGNIFICANT NVA.  THERE IS A SMALL CHC THE PCPN 
COULD END IN A BRIEF FLURRY...BUT THIS SEEMS TO BE TOO SMALL TO 
MENTION.

ON TUESDAY...SIGNIFICANT DRYING TAKES PLACE IN WAKE OF THE FRONT.  
THUS...WILL GO MOSTLY SUNNY ALL LOCATIONS.  LAKE EFFECT INDUCED 
CLOUDS/FLURRIES SHOULD BE CONFINED NORTH OF THE AREA DUE TO THE 
MAINLY WESTERLY TRAJECTORY OF THE 925 MB TO 850 MB FLOW.  

AS FOR TEMPS THROUGH TUESDAY...THEY WILL BE A LITTLE TRICKY TONIGHT 
AND MONDAY DUE TO CLOUDS/PCPN.  HAVE GONE WARMER THAN BOTH FWC/MAV 
TONIGHT...AND A BLEND OF THE FWC/MAV ON MONDAY.  FOR TUESDAY...TOOK 
A BLEND OF THE ETA/MAV GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM...
OVERALL...THE LATEST RUNS OF THE GFS CONTINUE TO COME MORE IN LINE 
WITH THE ECMWF. HOWEVER...MAJOR DIFFERENCES WITH THE MODELS HAVE 
BEEN WITH THE HANDLING OF THE SOUTHWEST US S/W DURING THE MID TO 
LATE WEEK. THE GFS IS FASTER AND WEAKER WITH EJECTING THIS SYSTEM 
NEWRD AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY FOR LATE WEEK. THUS HAVE 
SLOWED THE PROGRESSION OF THE AFFECTS OF THIS SYSTEM TO TREND MORE 
TOWARD THE ECMWF.

AS FOR THE WEAK FRONTAL BDRY THAT WILL AFFECT OUR AREA LATER 
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE LATEST RUNS OF THE GFS HAS ALSO 
COME MORE IN LINE WITH THE EARLIER ECMWF. THE GFS HAS TRENDED THIS 
SYSTEM FURTHER NORTH WITH A FRONTAL BDRY THAT APPEARS TO BE WASHING 
OUT AS IT MOVES INTO OUR AREA. THUS HAVE DROPPED THE SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS DURING THIS PERIOD...FEELING THIS MAY END UP AS A TRACE EVENT. 
VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FORCING WITH THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE. 
ISENTROPIC LIFT NEARLY NEGLIGIBLE AS WELL DURING THIS TIME.

HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE EAST COAST WAS BRINGING A SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW 
OVER REGION.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATED CLEAR SKIES OVER FORECAST 
AREA.  HOWEVER...MID CLOUDS HAD WORKED INTO CENTRAL INDIANA.

ETA/GFS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SLOWING UP PASSAGE OF COLD 
FRONT UNTIL DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY.  THUS WILL BACK OFF POPS 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND DRAG POPS INTO MONDAY NIGHT. BOTH MODELS ARE TRYING 
TO DEVELOP A WEAK WAVE ALONG FRONT AS IT MOVES ACROSS REGION.

AS FOR TODAY...SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL BRING WARMEST DAY WE HAVE HAD IN 
A MONTH WITH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED ABOUT 20 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.  
CLOUDS WILL THEN BE ON THE INCREASE LATE TODAY IN THE FAR WEST AND 
CONTINUE INTO THE OVERNIGHT. 

MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY REGION WILL CONTINUE TO SEE ZONAL FLOW 
ALOFT.  THIS WILL ALLOW SURFACE HIGH TO BUILD IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST...WHICH WILL BRING COOLER BUT STILL ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES.

MAV TEMPS LOOK A BIT TOO WARM MOST PLACES TODAY AND MONDAY.  WILL 
GENERALLY BACK OFF A FEW DEGREES MOST PLACES.  OVERNIGHT LOWS AND 
HIGHS ON TUESDAY LOOK REASONABLE.

.SHORT TERM...
A SFC RIDGE OF HIGH PRES WAS LOCATED FROM LAKE ONTARIO...EXTENDING 
SOUTHWARD ACRS THE APPALACHIANS...THEN INTO THE SE UNITED STATES.  
THIS HIGH WILL SLOWLY PUSH OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST ON SUNDAY.  
THUS...AM EXPECTING MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT AND ALSO INTO 
THE FIRST PART OF SUNDAY MORNING.  WHILE THE SFC HIGH PUSHES 
EAST...AN UPR LVL TROF AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EASTWARD 
FROM THE MS VLY ON SUNDAY...INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VLY ON 
MONDAY.  THIS IS A TAD SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS.  ISENTROPIC 
LIFT (WARM...MOIST ADVECTION) ALONG WITH FRONTOGENTICAL 
FORCING...WILL TAKE PLACE AHEAD OF THE FRONT (MORE SIGNIFICANT FROM 
850 MB TO 750 MB)...AS WELL AS UPR LVL DIVERGENCE FROM NE PIVOTING 
250 MB JET.  AS A RESULT...WILL SLOWLY INCRS POPS FROM W TO E SUNDAY 
NIGHT...WITH BEST DYNAMICS (LOW LVL CONV/UPR DIV) POISED FOR THE SRN 
AND ERN CWFA ON MONDAY.  WILL EMPLOY 60 TO 70 POPS NW WITH 80 POPS 
ELSEWHERE ON MONDAY.  BY MONDAY NIGHT...FRONT WILL BE EXITING OUR 
REGION EARLY IN THE EVENING...WITH PCPN QUICKLY COMING TO AN END.  
AM EXPECTING LOW LVL STRATOCUMULUS TO HANG AROUND THROUGH AT LEAST 
TUESDAY MORNING AS 850 MB THERMAL TROF (COLD POOL) AND 925 MB TO 850 
MB MSTR PERSIST.  THEREAFTER...THERE SHOULD BE A DECREASE IN THE 
CLOUD COVER LATER TUESDAY.  

AS FOR TEMPS...WILL OPEN UP A TEMPERATURE RANGE FOR THE SRN AND ERN 
CWFA TONIGHT AS RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL TAKE PLACE ONCE AGAIN IN 
FAVORED LOW-LYING VALLEYS AND SHELTERED LOCATIONS.  HAVE SIDED WITH 
THE WARMER GFS MOS GUIDANCE FOR SUNDAY.  LITTLE TEMPERATURE CHANGE 
IS EXPECTED MONDAY WITH HIGH CHC OF RAIN (AND THUS...TEMPS WILL ONLY 
WARM 3 TO 6 FROM SUNDAY NIGHT/S LOWS).


.LONG TERM...
GFS IN FAIR AGREEMENT WITH OTHER MODELS FOR THE EXTENDED. WITH 
REGARDS TO THE LOW AND ASSOCIATED FRONT THAT WILL AFFECT THE ILN 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY...IT APPEARS THAT THE LATEST GFS RUN NOW MORE IN 
LINE WITH THE ECMWF. STILL UNSURE HOW MUCH STRENGTH THIS SYSTEM WILL 
RETAIN AS IT PUSHES EAST ACROSS THE GRT LKS. MAIN DIFFERENCES IN THE 
MODELS APPEAR TO BE WITH SYSTEM FORECAST TO IMPACT OUR AREA ON 
FRIDAY. GFS SEEMS WEAKER AND FASTER WITH MID LEVEL S/W. THIS RESULTS 
IN BRINGING IN THE SFC SYSTEM QUICKER AS WELL. ALTHOUGH THIS IS 
LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD...WILL HOLD ONTO PRECIP A BIT LONGER 
THAN THE GFS DOES FOR ILN CWA. GUIDANCE TEMPS HAVE ALSO BEEN 
TRENDING LOWER FOR PORTIONS OF THIS PACKAGE. HAVE TRENDED THIS WAY

MODELS ARE IN DESCENT AGREEMENT THROUGH SUNDAY...KEEPING UPPER RIDGE 
AND SURFACE HIGH IN CONTROL OF OUR WEATHER.  HOWEVER...MODELS BEGIN 
TO DIVERGE WITH FROPA ON SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.  THE GFS HAS BEEN 
THE MOST CONSISTENT LATELY.  UKMET IS THE SLOWEST.  ECMWF THE 
FASTEST.  THE ETA AND GFS ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH TAKING 
FRONT THROUGH BETWEEN 09Z AND 20Z MONDAY.  SINCE FRONT IS RELATIVELY 
STRONG AND ACCELERATES THROUGH IT SHOULD BRING A DESCENT THREAT OF 
RAIN TO EVERYONE.  HOWEVER WITH TIMING ISSUES WILL ONLY GO UP TO 60

DEEP RIDGING WILL BUILD ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY IN THE SHORT TERM.  A 
LITTLE STRATO-CU WILL LINGER OVER THE FAR NORTHEAST EARLY THIS

INTO THE RGN LATER...BUT THATS ABOUT IT FOR CLOUD COVER.  HAVE 
ZEROED OUT THE SKY GRIDS FOR MUCH OF THE DAY AND WILL CARRY AN 
UNQUALIFIED SUNNY FORECAST.  SFC TRAJECTORY DATA NOT AVAILABLE 
YET...BUT LOOKING 
AT THE LATEST MAV GUIDANCE AND HIGHS TO OUR WEST AND SOUTHWEST WENT 
AHEAD AND TRIMMED BACK A COUPLE DEGREES ACROSS THE BOARD.

MODEL TIMESECTIONS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE LOW RH ACROSS THE AREA 
THROUGH SUNDAY.  WILL PROBABLY SEE AN INCREASE IN CIRRUS WITH TIME 
AS THE SHORT WAVE RIDGE DAMPENS AND SHIFTS EAST OF THE AREA...BUT 
STILL XPCT MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.  DID NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO PCPN 
CVRG OR TIMING SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.  LATEST ETA/GFS WOULD 
SUGGEST A FASTER FROPA AND ENDING OF THE PRECIPITATION...BUT THE 
ECMWF...UKMET AND CANADIAN REMAIN MUCH SLOWER.  WILL LET DAY SHIFT 
FINE TUNE THIS.

LEFT THE REST OF THE FORECAST TEMPERATURES ALONE FOR THE TIME BEING 
AS LATEST GUIDANCE LOOKS TO BE IN LINE WITH PREV FORECAST AND SEE NO

RUC40 DEPICTED CLOSED UPR LOW OVER NE INDIANA AT 18Z.  WATER VAPOR 
AND RUC40 ALSO HAVE SHOWN SEVERAL VORT MAXES SPINNING AROUND THIS 
UPR LOW.  THE VORT MAX NOTED OVER S CNTRL INDIANA WAS MAINLY 
RESPONSIBLE FOR SNOW SHOWERS SEEN ON KILN RADAR.  AS THIS VORT MAX 
SLIDES OFF TO THE SE THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS...THERE SHOULD BE 
SOME DECREASE IN THE SNOW SHOWER COVERAGE.  LOCAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
OF AN INCH OR LESS CAN BE EXPECTED.  ANOTHER VORT MAX DIVES THROUGH 
THE AREA BETWEEN 03Z AND 06Z...FOLLOWED BY THE LAST MAIN VORT MAX 
BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z (AS SHOWN BY THE GFS...WHICH TENDS TO HANDLE 
PLACEMENT OF SYNOPTIC FEATURES SUCH AS VORT MAXES BETTER).  AS OF 
NOW...HAVE PENCILED IN SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE EVENING 
HOURS...WITH THE BEST CHANCE ACRS S CNTRL OHIO/NE KY.  THEREAFTER 
...ONLY A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS IS EXPECTED.

ON CHRISTMAS...AS STATED ABOVE...THE LAST MAIN VORT MAX TO AFFECT 
OUR REGION MOVES THROUGH DURING THE MORNING HOURS.  SLIGHT CHC/CHC 
OF SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD DWINDLE BY AFTN ONCE THE VORT MAX IS WELL SE 
OF THE REGION.  ALSO...WAA BEGINS TO COMMENCE IN THE LOW 
LVLS...WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR CLEARING SKIES FROM SW TO NE FROM 
CHRISTMAS AFTN INTO THE EVENING.  SFC HIGH PRES WILL BUILD NE FROM 
THE TN VLY FROM CHRISTMAS NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING.

ON FRIDAY...AS THE SFC HIGH MOVES OFF TO THE EAST...EXPECT 
TEMPERATURES TO BEGIN A REBOUND AS WAA CONTINUES IN THE LOW LVLS.

THE WARMING TREND WILL CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND AHEAD OF NEXT 
WEATHER MAKER BY THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW WEEK.

.LONG TERM...
FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FOR THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK. 
CONSENSUS FOLLOWS WITH HPC THINKING WHICH FAVORS THE EUROPEAN MODEL 
SOLUTION. THIS ALSO HAS SOME SUPPORT FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND 
CANADIAN MODELS. AS A RESULT A STRONGER UPPER RIDGE IS FORECAST 
WHICH WILL SLOW THE MOVEMENT OF THE NEXT SYSTEM INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY. AND WITH A LONGER PERIOD OF SOUTHERLY FLOW TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO RISE WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR AT LEAST A COUPLE OF 
DAYS.

HAVE BROUGHT THE FRONT ACROSS THE REGION ON TUESDAY. MAY START TO 
SEE SOME SHOWERS AS EARLY AS SUNDAY MAINLY IN THE WEST AS LOW LEVELS 
MOISTEN AND MINOR DISTURBANCES RIDE UP THE BACK SIDE OF THE RIDGE. 
EXPECT CHANGE OVER TO SNOW SHOWERS TO BE DELAYED UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT 
WITH A FEW SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLY CONTINUING INTO WEDNESDAY.

ETA HAS BEEN TRENDING A BIT WARMER THROUGH 48-HRS...THE GFS HAS 
SHOWN TO BE MORE CONSISTANT. THE MAIN PROBLEM THROUGH CHRISTMAS DAY

FOR TODAY...WELL ESTABLISHED CAA PATTERN...BDRY LAYER 
INSTABIITY...AND A S/W SWINGING AROUND THE BASE OF THE MID LEVEL 
TROUGH SITUATED JUST TO OUR NW WILL PROVIDE THE MECHANISM FOR CHC 
SNOW SHOWERS TODAY. MOISTURE OFF LK MI MAY PLAY A ROLE IN THIS 
THREAT OF PRECIP AS WELL.

FOR TONIGHT...THREAT OF PRECIP MAY LAST THROUGH THE 
EVENING...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTH AS MORE S/W ENERGY SWINGS DOWN 
AROUND THE MID LEVEL TROUGH.

FOR CHRISTMAS DAY...A SLIGHT THREAT OF PRECIPITATION WILL REMAIN 
ACROSS OUR NORTH AND NORTHEAST SECTIONS. BUT THIS THREAT SHOULD

H5 LOW/TROF MOVES EAST OF THE AREA...ALTHOUGH A FEW FLURRIES MAY 
PERSIST A BIT LONGER MAINLY IN THE NORTH.  LOOKING AT THE 925 MB AND 
850 MB RH...THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO BREAK UP SW TO NE 
IN THE EARLY TO LATE AFTERNOON...BUT WILL LAG THIS SEVERAL HOURS AS 
THE MAV AND FWC GUIDANCE HAS BEEN A BIT FAST LATELY WITH THE 
CLEARING IN SIMILAR SITUATIONS.  

HAVE TWEAKED MAV TEMPS THROUGHOUT THE SHORT TERM...MAINLY AT

VERY FEW CHANGES TO FIRST PART OF EXTENDED AS UPR RIDGE WILL BRING 
DRY WARMER WEATHER TO THE OHIO VLY FOR FRI AND SAT.  NEXT STORM 
SYSTEM TO AFFECT REGION WILL EJECT INTO CNTRL PLAINS SAT...MOVNG 
INTO OHIO VLY SUN.  STILL QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AMONGST 
EXTENDED MODELS IN HANDLING OF THIS SYSTEM...LARGELY DUE TO DIFF IN

IN TRACKING SFC LO NORTH AND EAST INTO WESTERN GRT LKS SUN WITH 
ASSOCD FRNTL BNDRY TRACKING ACRS REGION LATE SUN AFTN INTO EVNG.

UPR LVL RIDGE LONGER.  UKMET AND CANADIAN EVEN SLOWER WITH BREAKING 
DOWN UPR RIDGE.  IN LIGHT OF TIMING DIFF...HAVE FOLLOWED HPC AND 
GONE CLOSE TO 12Z GFS/ECMWF SOLNS WHICH BRING PCPN INTO FCST AREA 
SUN WITH A SUN NIGHT/ERLY MON MRNG FROPA.  

BRIEFLY DRIER MON...THEN SECONDARY SFC WAVE DVLPG ALONG FRNTL BNDRY 
ACRS GULF COAST REGION HEADS NORTH AND EAST FOR APP MTS.  MODELS

SURFACE MAP SHOWS A LOW MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS INDIANA. A DRY SLOT 
HAS DEVELOPED IN ADVANCE OF THIS LOW. EXPECT ADDITIONAL 
PRECIPITATION TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE TRAILING FRONT AND MOVE 
NORTHEAST INTO THE REGION. AND IT APPEARS THAT THIS MAY ALREADY BE 
STARTING WITH SHOWERS IN WESTERN KENTUCKY. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING 
HOURS WITH PRECIPITATION COVERAGE MUCH LESS BEHIND THE FRONT.

IN ADDITION LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE CHANGE OVER TO 
SNOW WILL BE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS. SO HAVE BACKED 
OFF ON THE MIX FOR THIS AFTERNOON TO JUST THE FAR NORTHWEST AND ALSO 
MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS FOR TIMING THIS CHANGE INTO THE EVENING.

MODELS HAVE FINALLY COME INTO AGREEMENT ON WHAT THIS SYSTEM WILL BE 
DOING OVER FCST AREA TODAY.

HAVE CONTINUED CATEGORICAL POPS TODAY...EARLY IN THE WEST AND LATER 
IN THE DAY EAST. THICKNESSES AND H8 TEMPS DROP TO SUPPORT SNOW 
TOWARDS 0Z TONIGHT AND SOME CHANGEOVER SHOULD OCCUR BEFORE THE LAST 
REMNANTS OF MOISTURE ARE OUT OF FCST AREA. WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE 
KEPT ANY ACCUMULATING SNOW TO LESS THAN AN INCH AND DONT EXPECT 
MUCH AT ALL AS THERES A FAIRLY GOOD OFFSET FROM THE MOISTURE TO THE 
COLD AIR. 

FLURRIES SHOULD REMAIN POSSIBLE FOR THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WITH A 
CONTINUED CHANCE CLOSER TO THE GTLKS (NRN FCST AREA) EARLY ON 
CHRISTMAS. 

TEMPS TODAY WILL BE THE TRICKIEST AND THERES A GOOD GRADIENT

UPPER FLOW IS BECOMING SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF DEEPENING TROF.  TROF IS 
PROGGED TO FORM INTO A CUT OFF LOW THAT WILL TAKE DAYS TO MEANDER 
THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND NEW ENGLAND.  ILN WILL REMAIN UNDER A 
MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW UNTIL THE AXIS OF THE CUT OFF CROSSES THE AREA 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

SURFACE MAP HAS A COLD FRONT CONNECTING LOWS OVER EAST CENTRAL 
CANADA AND OKLAHOMA/TEXAS.  BOTH ETA AND GFS HAVE A GOOD 
REPRESENTATION OF CURRENT SURFACE FEATURES. 

GFS HAS SPED UP WITH RESPECT TO PREVIOUS RUNS AND NOW THE GFS AND 
ETA ARE VERY CLOSE SURFACE PATTERN THROUGH 84 HOURS.  THERE IS SOME 
VARIANCE IN THE MODELS POSITIONING OF THE 500MB LOW...WITH THE GFS 
DEEPER AND A BIT FARTHER NORTH.  

OBS AND RADAR SHOW JUST A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS SO FAR WITH THIS SLOW TO 
DEVELOP SYSTEM.  SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN AS IT MOVES 
THROUGH NORTHWEST OHIO ON TUESDAY AND THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH ILN BY TUESDAY EVENING.  DUE TO MODEL CERTAINTY...100 POPS 
ARE WARRANTED. CHANGE TO SNOW WILL OCCUR WITH FROPA.  SNOW WILL 
PROBABLY BE BRIEF WITH MODELS BACKING OFF ON POST FRONTAL MOISTURE 
WITH A WELL DEFINED DRY SLOT BEHIND THE FRONT.  

CONDITIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR OUR AREA TO RECEIVE SOME LAKE 
ENHANCED SNOW SHOWERS WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  AT THIS POINT 
MODELS HAVE 850 MB WINDS A BIT TOO WESTERLY FOR THE LAKE ENHANCED 
SNOWS TO REACH OUR WHOLE FORECAST AREA. THEREFORE WILL KEEP CHANCE 
POPS FROM ABOUT I-70 NORTH.

TEMPS:  NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST.  RAISED SOUTHEAST 
COUNTIES TUESDAY CLOSER TO MAV/RLX.  LOWERED WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH 
THERMAL TROF AXIS CROSSING AREA.  

.LONG TERM...
AS UPR TROF SHIFTS TOWARD NEW ENGLAND LATE CHRISTMAS AFTERNOON INTO

VALLEY BY 00Z WEDNESDAY.  ETA MEANWHILE KEEPS THE NORTHERN AND 
SOUTHERN STREAMS SEPARATE RESULTING IN A WEAKER SURFACE 
REPRESENTATION.  GFS CONTINUES TO HAVE THE BEST RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY AND IS SUPPORTED BY THE UKMET AND ECMWF...WHILE THE ETA 
IS THE ODD MODEL OUT...SO WILL BASE THIS FORECAST ON THE GFS.

SURFACE RIDGE WILL PROVIDE A NICE DAY TODAY.  COLD FRONT THEN DROPS 
THROUGH THE WESTERN LAKES TONIGHT.  ALL MODELS AGREE IN DEVELOPS 
CLOUDS OVER THE FA TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  WILL KEEP THE FA DRY 
OVERNIGHT...AS LIFT IS WEAK AND LOWEST LEVELS SHOULD TAKE A WHILE TO 
MOISTEN.

WILL SPREAD THE CHANCE OF SOME LIGHT SHOWERS OF THE FA ON MONDAY.  
AS UPPER TROF DEEPENS MONDAY INTO TUESDAY SURFACE LOW LIFTS OUT OF 
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND THROUGH INDIANA.  THIS WILL KEEP THE FA IN THE 
WARM SECTOR.  BEST CHANCE OF RAIN SHOULD BE LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON

MODELS CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFERENCES WITH SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE FA 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

ETA STILL KEEPS SEPARATE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAMS AT 500MB.  
THIS ALLOWS FOR A MUCH WEAKER SURFACE LOW AND A QUICKER MOVEMENT 
EAST OF THE COLD AIR.  ETA BEGINS CHANGE OVER OF PCPN AROUND 15Z TUE.

STILL PREFER THE GFS SOLUTION AS IT IS BACKED BY THE UKMET...ECMWF 
AND SOMEWHAT BY THE NGM.  THIS RUN OF THE GFS IS QUICKER WITH THE 
FRONTAL PASSAGE...BRINGING IT ACROSS THE FA ON TUESDAY.  THIS DROPS 
THE 1000-500MB THICKNESS BELOW 1300 IN THE WEST BY 00Z WED.  CHANGE

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES A WEAKENING SURFACE LOW SOUTH PMH.  KILN 
SHOWING PREDOMINATELY LIGHT SNOW SOUTH OF A CONNERSVILLE TO DAYTON 
TO CIRCLEVILLE LINE.  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES SOME 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS NORTH OF I-70.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH KEEPING UPPER TROF OVER THE 
REGION THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT.  THIS WILL RESULT IN CYCLONIC NORTHWEST 
FLOW OFF THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH THIS SAME TIME.  THUS A CHANCE OF 
LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES WILL DOMINATE THE FORECAST.  THE 
BEST THREAT WILL BE OVERNIGHT WITH UP TO AN ADDITIONAL INCH POSSIBLE 
ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER AND LESS THAN AN INCH ACROSS THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST AREA.

UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGE BUILD IN ON SATURDAY BRINGING SOME CLEARING

.LONG TERM...
SFC HIGH PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED 
STATES ON SUNDAY...ALLOWING FOR A RETURN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW...AND 
HENCE A WARMING TREND.  ALL LONG RANGE MODELS ARE SIMILAR IN 
DEVELOPING THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM FOR NEXT WEEK.  THE GFS IS 
FORECASTING A MERGE BETWEEN  A NRN UPR LVL SHORTWAVE FROM CANADA 
WITH A SRN UPR LVL SHORTWAVE OVER THE TEXAS/OKLA PANHANDLE.  THE NRN 
SYSTEM WILL PULL DOWN SOME COLD AIR AS IT MERGES WITH THE SRN 
SYSTEM.  EVENTUALLY...A CLOSE LOW AT 500 MB IS EXPECTED.  THE CLOSED 
LOW IS FCST TO SET UP SHOP OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY BY CHRISTMAS EVE.  WARM AIR AHEAD OF ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
WILL WARM TEMPS INTO THE 40S AND 50S ON MONDAY INTO TUESDAY.  AS IT 
LOOKS NOW...COLDER AIR IS EXPECTED TO WRAP AROUND THE CLOSED LOW 
FROM THE SOUTHWEST...THEN GRADUALLY HEAD NORTHEAST TOWARD NRN 
OHIO/NE PENNSYLVANIA WEDNESDAY NIGHT (CHRISTMAS EVE).  THUS...PCPN 
WILL BE IN THE FORM OF SHOWERS LATE MONDAY INTO WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...THEN A GRADUAL MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW CHRISTMAS EVE DAY.  
RAIN/SNOW MIX SHOULD CHANGE TO ALL SNOW CHRISTMAS EVE NIGHT.  
AGAIN...THIS IS STILL A LONG WAYS OUT.  GIVEN THE DIFFICULTY OF 
MODELS TO PEG CLOSED LOW POSITIONS...THE ACTUAL POSITION COULD VERY 
WELL END UP SOMEWHERE OTHER THAN CURRENT FCST LOCATION...CHANGING 
EVERYTHING FROM TEMPS TO PCPN TYPE.  AM GOING FOR SNOW CHRISTMAS EVE 
NIGHT AND CHRISTMAS DAY ATTM...BUT WE WILL JUST HAVE TO KEEP 
ADJUSTING THE EXTENDED FCST AS CHRISTMAS APCHES.  FOR THOSE HOPING 
FOR A WHITE CHRISTMAS...IT LOOKS POSSIBLE AT THIS POINT.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES CYCLONIC FLOW OFF THE GREAT LAKES OVER 
THE REGION.  KILN SHOWING RETURNS HAVE DIMINISHED...HOWEVER THERE 
ARE A FEW AREAS STILL REPORTING FLURRIES.  SATELLITE IMAGERY 
INDICATES EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER OVER THE REGION WITH SOME CLEARING 
SLOWLY WORKING IN FROM INDIANA.

MODELS ARE ALL IN DESCENT AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING SECONDARY COLD 
FRONT ACROSS MAINLY SOUTHERN FA LATE TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY.  LATEST 
RUNS SHOW BEST LIFT MAINLY SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER AND THE CVG 
METRO.  BOTH MODELS SHOW DESCENT MID LEVEL LIFT AS FAR NORTH AS 
I-70.  HOWEVER...LOWER LEVELS OF THE ATMOS IS RATHER DRY AND WILL 
TAKE A WHILE TO SATURATE.  THUS WILL GO WITH AROUND AN INCH SOUTH OF 
THE RIVER (EXCEPT SE IN) AND AN INCH OR LESS FROM CONNERSVILLE TO 
WILMINGTON TO CHILLICOTHE.  NORTH OF THAT LITTLE IF ANY ACCUMULATION.

UPPER TROF AND CYCLONIC SURFACE FLOW OFF THE LAKES WILL KEEP 
CONDITIONS CLOUDY WITH THREAT OF LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY SATURDAY.  UPPER TROF THEN MOVES OFF 
TO THE EAST ALLOWING SURFACE RIDGE TO BUILD IN BRINGING SOME

DEVELOPING MORE OF A SPLIT NRN/SRN STREAM AND KEEPING CLOSED LOW 
FARTHER TO THE SOUTH...AND 17/00Z UKMET LOOKS TO BE TRENDING THAT 
WAY TOO. IT IS STILL EARLY BUT IT DOES LOOK LIKE THERE WILL BE AN 
INCREASING CHANCE OF PCPN FOR TUE HEADING INTO WED SO WILL GO AHEAD

SO HAVE ADJUSTED TEMPS UP FOR FOR MON/MON NIGHT/TUE TIME FRAME. WITH 
MORE OF A CLOSED OFF LOW...COLD AIR POOL NOT ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE

12Z ILN SOUNDING HAS FAIRLY DEEP LAYER OF MOISTURE TRAPPED BELOW 
INVERSION WHICH IS JUST ABOVE 925 MB WHILE SAT PIX SHOWING LOW 
CLOUDS EXTENDING WELL BACK TO OUR WEST INTO CENTRAL ILLINOIS. BACK 
EDGE OF LOW CLOUDS HAS NOT MADE MUCH EASTWARD PROGRESSION THIS

WAA FORECAST THROUGH THE DAY. HOWEVER...GIVEN STRENGTH OF INVERSION 
AND LOW SUN ANGLE...THINK CLOUDS WILL BE SLOW TO CLEAR OUT TODAY. 
WILL KEEP AN EYE ON SAT PIX OVER NEXT HOUR OR SO BUT CURRENT 
THINKING IS TO JUST GO WITH CLOUDY SKIES FOR TODAY. EVEN IF WE DO 
SEE SOME PARTIAL CLEARING LATE...PLENTY OF HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ALREADY 
STREAMING IN FROM THE WEST. WITH LOW CLOUDS...THINK TEMPS WILL NOT

LOW CLOUDS PERSIST ACROSS THE REGION AS SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS IN. BIG 
QUESTION IS HOW LONG THEY REMAIN. LOOKS LIKE IT WILL TAKE UNTIL 
RIDGE AXIS PASSES AND WARM AIR ADVECTION GETS GOING FOR THE CLOUDS 
TO ERODE. USED 925 MB RELATIVE HUMIDITY FORECASTS AS A GUIDE WHICH 
SUGGESTS THAT CLEARING WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE AREA 
TOWARD MIDDAY AND THEN CONTINUE EASTWARD THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. BY 
THE TIME THE LOWER CLOUDS DIMINISH CIRRUS WILL BE STREAMING INTO THE 
REGION. BUT THIS LOOKS FAIRLY THIN AT THIS POINT. 

WITH CLOUDS THROUGH THE MORNING...SNOW COVER...AND CLOSE TO A 
MINIMUM AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE SOLAR RADIATION DUE TO THE APPROACHING 
SOLSTICE...HAVE DROPPED HIGH TEMPERATURES QUITE A BIT EVEN 
UNDERCUTTING THE LOWEST GUIDANCE. THIS SHOULD LEAD INTO TEMPERATURES 
BEING BELOW GUIDANCE TONIGHT AS WELL SINCE THEY WILL BE STARTING AT 
A LOWER VALUE. HOWEVER EXPECT MINIMA TO BE EARLY IN THE WEST AND 
CLOSER TO MIDNIGHT IN THE EAST AS SOUTHERLY WINDS BEGIN TO PICK UP 
OVERNIGHT.

MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW TIMING DIFFERENCE WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM. HAVE 
FAVORED THE SLOWER GFS WHICH HAS SUPPORT FROM THE CANADIAN AND 
UNITED KINGDOM MODELS. THUS THE COLD FRONT WILL NOT CROSS THE REGION 
UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR A GOOD WARM UP BUT 
BELIEVE THAT GFS MOS IS OVERDONE IN THIS REGARD. AFTER ALL THERE 
WILL LIKELY STILL BE SNOW TO MELT AND LOWER CLOUDS WILL BE MOVING 
BACK INTO THE AREA AHEAD OF THE PRECIPITATION. HAVE ALSO BUMPED POPS 
UP TO LIKELY. DO NOT EXPECT A LARGE AMOUNT OF RAIN BUT THERE SHOULD 
BE PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE. AS COLD AIR COMES IN BEHIND THE FRONT 
EXPECT TO START TO HAVE A MIX OR CHANGE OVER TO SNOW IN THE 
NORTHWEST LATE IN THE AFTERNOON.

THIS CHANGE OVER WILL PROGRESS ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY EVENING BUT 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE DIMINISHING AS IT DOES. HOWEVER SHOULD START 
TO SEE SOME WRAP AROUND AND LAKE ENHANCED SNOW SHOWERS LATER IN THE 
NIGHT AND CONTINUING INTO WEDNESDAY.

REGIONAL RADAR SHOWS DRY SLOT QUICKLY WORKING INTO THE SOUTHWEST 
PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS SHOULD CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION 
THROUGH THE MORNING. APPEARS THAT MIXED PRECIPITATION IS CONFINED TO 
NORTHEAST KENTUCKY AND SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO. THERE MAY BE A BRIEF 
PERIOD OF FREEZING DRIZZLE AS HEAVIER PRECIPITATION COMES TO AN END.

SOME LIGHT SNOW IS OCCURRING BACK ACROSS INDIANA TO THE NORTHWEST OF 
THE SURFACE LOW WHICH IS IN CENTRAL KENTUCKY. EXPECT THAT THIS WRAP 
AROUND SNOW WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE AREA AS THE WEAK SURFACE LOW LIFTS 
NORTHEAST TODAY. HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT THIS WILL BE LIGHT SNOW 
WITH LITTLE OR NO ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATION. THIS MAY LINGER INTO THE 
EARLY EVENING IN EASTERN ZONES. HAVE REARRANGED THE ADVISORIES A 
BIT WITH WESTERN ZONES ENDING THIS MORNING AND EASTERN ZONES 
CONTINUING THROUGH THE DAY.

EXPECT LOW CLOUDS TO BE STUBBORN AND SLOWLY DECREASE FROM WEST TO 
EAST LATE TONIGHT. THESE SHOULD DISSIPATE ENTIRELY AS THE SURFACE 
RIDGE BUILDS IN ON MONDAY. WITH SOME SNOW COVER HAVE GONE A FEW 
DEGREES BELOW GFS MOS HIGHS.

UP THE OHIO VALLEY LATER TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. THIS WILL CAUSE AN 
INVERTED TROUGH TO DEVELOP AT THE SURFACE. MODELS CONTINUE TO DIFFER 
ON THE STRENGTH AND LOCATION OF A WAVE ALONG THIS TROUGH. WILL STICK 
WITH MORE CONSISTENT GFS SOLUTION WHICH SHOWS A WEAK WAVE THAT WILL 
MOVE FROM EASTERN KENTUCKY INTO WEST VIRGINIA. 

THIS MEANS THAT THERE WILL BE LESS OF A WARM INTRUSION IN THE LOW 
LEVELS COMPARED TO THE ETA. SO EXPECT PRECIPITATION TYPE TO BE 
PREDOMINANTLY SNOW. EXCEPTION WILL BE ALONG THE SOUTHEAST EDGE OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. THERE CONTINUES TO BE THE POTENTIAL FOR MELTING 
IN THE LOWEST SEVERAL THOUSAND FEET. BUT IT IS A BIT UNCERTAIN 
WHETHER THERE WILL BE ENOUGH WARM AIR TO CHANGE ALL PRECIPITATION 
OVER TO LIQUID. TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLOWLY RISING LATE TONIGHT. SO 
INITIALLY EXPECT ANY LIQUID TO BE IN THE FORM OF FREEZING RAIN. BUT 
THAT COULD CHANGE TO RAIN IN THE VICINITY OF PORTSMOUTH.

BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL OCCUR LATE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY 
MORNING. FORCING WILL HAVE MOVED OFF TO THE EAST BY AFTERNOON BUT 
THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR A BRIEF BURST OF SNOW AS THE UPPER TROUGH 
AXIS SWINGS ACROSS THE AREA LATER IN THE DAY.

WENT AHEAD AND ISSUED AN ADVISORY FOR ABOUT THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. EXPECT GREATEST SNOW ACCUMULATIONS TO BE FROM 
LANCASTER TO CHILLICOTHE. SOUTH OF THAT REGION MAY GET MORE QPF BUT 
ACCUMULATIONS MAY BE LIMITED DUE TO WARMER TEMPERATURES THE 
POTENTIAL FOR RAIN AND FREEZING RAIN. EXTENDED THE ADVISORY AS FAR 
WEST AS OWENTON DUE TO THE WINTRY MIX EVEN THOUGH SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
MAY END UP MARGINAL FOR AN ADVISORY THERE.

STILL MODEL DIFFERENCES WITH THIS WEEKENDS STORM.  ETA CONTINUES TO 
BE THE MOST AGGRESSIVE WITH THE 500MB TROF AND WITH BRINGING A LOW 
WEST OF THE THE APPALACHIANS.  WITH THIS SCENARIO...WARMER AIR IS 
PULLED INTO THE SYSTEM...AND SNOW IS QUESTIONABLE ACROSS THE SOUTH 
AS A RAIN...FREEZING RAIN WILL BE THE BIG PLAYERS.

I PREFER THE COOLER GFS SOLUTION...WHICH KEEPS THE CLOSED SURFACE 
LOW ALONG THE EAST COAST.  THIS WILL KEEP THE PCPN TYPE MOSTLY 
SNOW.  THE EXCEPTION WILL BE IN THE SE THIRD...WHERE THE GFS 
1000-850 THICKNESSES RISE ABOVE 1300M AT 12Z SUN.

HIGHEST QPF WILL BE IN THE SE...BUT WITH THE MIXED PCPN THEY 
PROBABLY WONT HAVE THE HEAVIEST SNOW ACCUMULATIONS.  EXPECTING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF 2-5 INCHES OF SNOW IN THE EAST FOR THE ENTIRE 
WEEKEND...1-3 FARTHER WEST.  IF I HAD TO PICK WHERE THE HEAVIEST 
BAND WOULD FALL PROBABLY WOULD BE IN HOCKING ROSS...WITH A LITTLE 
LESS LICKING THROUGH PICKAWAY TO CLINTON.

WARMED TEMPERATURES A LITTLE TONIGHT...THEN LEFT THE REST OF THE 
FORECAST UNCHANGED.

DONT PLAN ON ISSUING A WATCH AS DONT THINK THAT WE WILL HAVE THE 6 
INCHES OF SNOW OR THE QUARTER OF AN INCH OF ICE.  COULD ISSUE THIRD

ALIGN.

WILL ISSUE AN SPS THIS AFTERNOON.

LOW CLOUDS ACROSS THE REGION HAVE BEEN STUBBORN TO DIMINISH. BUT 
EXPECT THEM TO CLEAR THIS MORNING. COULD SEE A LITTLE BIT OF CIRRUS 
IN THE AFTERNOON BUT SHOULD BE MAINLY SUNNY. DESPITE THIS IT WILL BE 
A COOL DAY WITH LOW LEVEL THICKNESS FAVORING READINGS NEAR THE NGM 
MOS NUMBERS.

SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHWEST US WILL MOVE OUT INTO THE PLAINS TONIGHT 
WITH PLENTIFUL UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE STREAMING OUT AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM. THIS SHOULD SPREAD ACROSS AT LEAST THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE 
AREA OVERNIGHT WHICH COULD MAKE LOWS A LITTLE TRICKY. GUIDANCE IS 
QUITE COOL AND HAVE GONE CLOSE TO THAT ALONG THE NORTHERN TIER WHERE 
CLOUDS WILL BE FEWER AND OR THINNER. BUT RAISED MINIMA IN THE SOUTH 
THINKING THAT THE THICKENING HIGHER CLOUDS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES 
FROM GETTING SO LOW.

AS THIS SYSTEM LIFTS NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION ON 
SATURDAY A FAIR AMOUNT OF LIFT DEVELOPS BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. IT 
MAY TAKE A WHILE FOR THE LOW LEVELS TO MOISTEN BUT EVENTUALLY EXPECT 
TO SEE SOME LIGHT SNOW ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH THE BEST CHANCE IN 
THE SOUTH. 

MODELS DIVERGE FROM THIS POINT WITH THE GFS WEAKENING THIS INITIAL 
SYSTEM WITH ENERGY TRANSFERRING TO A SOUTHERN SHORT WAVE WHILE THE 
ETA HAS MORE OF A PHASED LOOK. WILL CONTINUE TO LEAN TOWARD THE GFS 
WHICH HAS SUPPORT FROM THE EUROPEAN AND UNITED KINGDOM MODELS. THIS 
WILL RESULT IN AN INVERTED TROUGH ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WHILE THE 
MAIN SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS ALONG THE EAST COAST WHICH IS A TYPICAL 
SCENARIO.

LIGHT SNOW SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING WITH THE PRECIPITATION 
PICKING UP LATER SATURDAY NIGHT ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHEASTERN ZONES. IN 
THIS AREA THE LOWER LEVELS WILL BE WARMING SO THERE WILL PROBABLY BE 
A MIX OF PRECIPITATION. INITIALLY THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE SNOW AND 
FREEZING RAIN BUT THEN AS SURFACE TEMPERATURES GRADUALLY WARM IT 
WILL BE SNOW AND RAIN. THIS MIXTURE WILL LIMIT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
DESPITE THE GREATER QPF AMOUNTS EXPECTED. PRECIPITATION SHOULD 
CONTINUE INTO SUNDAY MORNING AND THEN QUICKLY DIMINISH AS THE EAST 
COAST SYSTEM TAKES OVER.

REMOVE THE THUNDER. ITS STILL GOING TO BE POSSIBLE FOR AN ELEVATED

THUNDER WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE LOW ITSELF BUT

FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH WEAK LOW LVL CONVERGENCE AND SHALLOW MSTR (I.E.

ECMWF...UKMET AND GFS DIFFER GREATLY ON THE TRACK OF THE LOW AND 
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE RUN TO RUN VARIABILITY AS WELL.  

THE GFS HAS TRENDED FASTER AND FURTHER EAST ON THE LATEST RUN...WITH 
THE LOW OFF THE EAST COAST BY 12Z MONDAY...PORTENDING AN EARLIER AND 
MUCH LESS SIGNIFICANT SNOW EVENT FOR THE FCST AREA THAN PREVIOUS 
RUNS.  IN CONTRAST...THE ECMWF PUTS THE LOW FURTHER WEST...TRACKING 
UP THE APPALACHIANS.  IN RESPONSE...HAVE PUT POPS IN 
EARLIER...STARTING IN THE SOUTH VERY EARLY SUNDAY MORNING.  
HOWEVER...WILL RESIST THE TOTAL GFS SOLUTION...AND HANG ONTO SLIGHT 
POPS INTO EARLY MONDAY.

AS WAS EXPECTED YESTERDAY...GUIDANCE HAS COME IN MUCH COOLER THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. AT THIS POINT...BOTH GUIDANCE AND GFS LOW LEVEL 
THICKNESSES SUGGEST AN ALL SNOW EVENT SUNDAY. ANOTHER FRONT 
APPROACHES TUESDAY...AND GUIDANCE AS WELL AS GFS LOW LEVEL 
THICKNESSES SUGGEST AN ALL RAIN EVENT.

.SHORT TERM...
FCST TODAY HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH FROM PREVIOUS FCSTS. QUESTION IS 
WHAT FEATURE THE GFS IS HITTING ON TOMORROW AFTERNOON TO GENERATE 
PRECIP OVER NRN FCST AREA. IVE GOT SOME MENTION OF SHOWERS OVER THE 
NORTH WITH JUST 20 POPS IN THE SOUTH...NONE FOR ERN 1/2. PREVIOUS 
SHIFTS HAD ME PREACHING LESS PRECIP IN THE WARM SECTOR AND I WANTED 
TO CONTINUE THIS THINKING. DIDNT HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE THAT PRECIP 
DURING THE DAY TUES WOULD BE JUST SPRINKLES, BUT THATS THE CURRENT 
THINKING EVEN THOUGH SHOWERS ARE MENTIONED INSTEAD.

REAL CHANCE FOR SHOWERS COMES IMMEDIATELY AHEAD OF FRONT STARTING 
LATE TUES NIGHT IN THE WEST AND DURING THE DAY FOR ENTIRE FCST AREA 
ON WED. CAN SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLD THUNDER WITH THE NEG TILTED 
TROF AND STRONG LLJET SETTING UP, BUT WOULD LIKE TO HOLD OFF ON THIS 
FOR NOW. INDICIES (LI/CAPE/ETC) ARE NOT ENTIRELY FAVORABLE FOR 
THUNDER BUT DONT RULE IT OUT EITHER, ESPECIALLY FOR ELEVATED 
CONVECTION ABOVE THE WARM AIR INTRUSION IN THE LLVLS. 

CHANGEOVER SHOULD OCCUR RELATIVELY QUICKLY WITH PASSAGE OF FRONT ON 
TUES EVENING. TIMING IS STILL IN QUESTION SO I JUST WORDED A 
CHANGEOVER WITH SOME FALLING TEMPERATURES DURING THE AFTERNOON IN 
THE WEST. ENTIRE FCST AREA SHOULD CHANGEOVER IN THE EVENING...AND 
MAJORITY OF MOISTURE SHOULD BE EAST AT THIS TIME SO SNOW SHOULDNT 
BE MUCH OF A PROBLEM ATTM. 

&&

.LONG TERM...
DRY WEATHER SHOULD PERSIST THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.  THE FOCUS OF 
THE EXTENDED FCST IS THE SUNDAY/MONDAY SYSTEM.  THE ECMWF...UKMET 
AND GFS SHOW A DEVELOPING SOUTHERN SYSTEM AT 12Z SUNDAY...BUT THERE 
IS OBVIOUSLY A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY THIS FAR OUT.  

AT THIS POINT...GFS LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES SUGGEST MOST OF AREA 
SHOULD CHANGE OVER FROM ALL SNOW EARLY TO AT LEAST A RAIN/SNOW MIX 
DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY.  

THE PCPN SHOULD CHANGE BACK TO ALL SNOW NW TO SE AT SOME POINT 
SUNDAY NIGHT.  GUIDANCE LOOKS TO WARM FOR MONDAY...AS THE LOW MOVES 
UP THE APPALACHIANS TOWARD THE EAST COAST.

SURFACE RIDGE FORECAST TO SLIDE SLOWLY EAST THROUGH TODAY SO EXPECT 
TO SEE A CONTINUATION OF HIGH CLOUDS SPILLING INTO THE AREA. SAT PIX 
SHOWING SOME ENHANCEMENT WITH THE HIGHER CLOUDS SO THEY MAY BE THICK 
ENOUGH TO BLOCK OUT THE SUN AT TIMES BUT THINK WE WILL SEE ENOUGH 
SUN TO WARRANT PARTLY SUNNY TODAY. LOW LEVEL FLOW FORECAST TO SWING 
AROUND TO THE SOUTHWEST ON BACK SIDE OF RIDGE TODAY WITH SOME WAA 
DEVELOPING. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR A DECENT WARM UP TODAY... 
PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST WHERE WILL NUDGE UP TEMPS A LITTLE 
HIGHER THAN GUID.

SOME PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCES HAVE DEVELOPED BETWEEN THE ETA AND THE 
GFS IN REGARDS TO SYSTEM FOR MID WEEK. GFS HAS CONTINUED TO TREND 
SLOWER WHILE ETA NOW QUITE A BIT QUICKER THAN GFS. BY 12Z WED...ETA 
HAS SURFACE LOW INTO LOWER MICH WHILE GFS HAS IT STILL BACK NEAR 
STL. ALSO...WITH FASTER SOLUTION...ETA QUITE A BIT QUICKER BRINGING 
IN COLDER AIR FOR WED NIGHT. BASED ON LAST FEW MODEL RUNS...STILL 
THINKING THAT SLOWER IS BETTER SO WILL TREND THINGS SLOWER THAN ETA 
AND A LITTLE CLOSER TO GFS. THIS ACTUALLY ENDS UP BEING PRETTY CLOSE 
TO CURRENT FORECAST WHICH MAY ALSO BE BEST WAY TO GO GIVEN CURRENT 
DIFFERENCES. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN FOR THE NORTH AND WEST FOR WED 
WITH BEST CHANCE IN THE AFTERNOON AS WE SHOULD START TO GET INTO 
SOME BETTER ISENT LIFT. LIKELY POPS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WED STILL 
LOOK GOOD. WILL KEEP A CHANCE FOR WED NIGHT WITH THURSDAY DRY...BUT 
IF SLOWER GFS IS RIGHT...MAY EVENTUALLY NEED TO LINGER SOME PCPN 
INTO THURSDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE EAST. WITH SURFACE LOW TRACK 
EVEN FURTHER TO OUR WEST ON BOTH THE GFS AND ETA...POSSIBILITY OF 
ANY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW LOOKS LESS LIKELY AND WILL DOWNPLAY THAT. 
ALSO WILL HAVE TO BUMP UP TEMPS QUITE A BIT FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...WED 
AND WED NIGHT AS REGION WILL BE MORE INTO THE WARM SECTOR.

HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD AFFECT MUCH OF THE FCST AREA TONIGHT, 
PARTICULARLY TO THE NORTH AS THE H5 RIDGE IN THE NORTHERN GTLKS 
MOVES EAST. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE UNDER THE MEAN RIDGE OVER THE WRN 
GTLKS AT THIS LEVEL, PARTIALLY IN RESPONSE TO A PAIR OF S/WS...ONE 
OVER LKSUPERIOR TONIGHT AND THE OTHER APPROACHING FROM THE MIDWEST 
TOWARDS SRN LKMICH. LOW LEVEL H8 RIDGE STAYS IN PLACE OVER FCST AREA 
TONIGHT SO ANY CLOUD COVER WILL BE PRIMARILY CONCENTRATED NW-SE WITH 
PC SKIES IN THE SRN 1/2 OF FCST AREA. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN FAIRLY 
UNIFORM TEMPS ACROSS THE FCST AREA BUT SNOW PACK IN THE NORTH SHOULD 
CUT READINGS HERE BY A CATEGORY AT LEAST. 

AS THE H8 RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AND MOVES EAST OVERNIGHT MON, MOISTURE 
INCREASES SIGNIFICANTLY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING 40KT JET THAT 
INCREASES TO 50KT BY TUES EVE OVER INDIANA. ETA GOES BONKERS WITH A 
70 KT LLJET OVER SRN OH BY 12Z WED. GFS SOLUTION IS MORE REALISTIC 
BUT STILL HAS A DECENT AREA OF 50KT+ AIMING AT THE OHIO RIVER. 
EXPECT CATEGORICAL POPS IF THIS SCENARIO PANS OUT...BUT TRENDS ARE 
FOR THE H5 PATTERN TO SLOW DOWN. ENSEMBLES ALL HAVE PRECIP OVER THE 
WEST AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE SLOWER SOLUTIONS ONLY ENCOMPASS A LITTLE 
OVER 1/2 OF THE RUNS FROM THE 0Z CYCLE. 

TEMPS TUES PM SHOULD SEE AN EARLY LOW WITH STEADY OR RISING TEMPS 
AHEAD OF THE NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM. DONT EXPECT THAT MUCH WIND TO GET 
DOWN TO THE SFC FOR THE NIGHTTIME HOURS BUT HAVE INCLUDED SOME GUSTS 
IN THE GRIDS FOR TUES INTO WED. 

TEMPS OVER NRN FCST AREA COULD DROP LOWER THAN FCST WITH SNOW PACK - 
INTO THE TEENS, BUT SE WINDS DO NOT FAVOR THIS SCENARIO OVER ANY 
PLACES OUTSIDE OF MAYBE HARDIN COUNTY OR NRN AUGLAIZE AND DARKE. 
WILL BREAK THESE 3 OUT FOR THIS TEMP DIFFERENCE. 

ASIDE FROM THIS, CHANCE POPS SHOULD MOVE IN NW-SE TUES NIGHT BUT ID 
THINK THAT THEYLL HOLD OFF UNTIL THE DAY ON WED FOR ERN 1/2 OF FCST 
AREA. WED PRECIP LOOKS LIKELY IF NOT CATEGORICAL BUT ANOTHER MODEL 
RUN TONIGHT SHOULD CLEAR SOME OF THE TIMING DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN 
MODELS. THINK THAT THE ONSET OF PRECIP WILL ACTUALLY END UP ALONG 
OH/IN BORDER AT 12Z WED.

SAT PIX SHOWING LOWER CLOUDS ERODING AWAY FROM THE NORTH THIS 
MORNING. THIS HAS ALLOWED FOR SOME PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP UP ACROSS 
THE FAR NORTH BUT IT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE TOO BAD ATTM SO DID NOT 
MENTION IN FORECAST. MODELS HANG ON TO SOME 925 MB MOISTURE THROUGH 
THE MORNING HOURS...PARTICULARLY IN THE EAST SO WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED TO SEE A FEW LINGERING LOW CLOUDS THROUGH MID MORNING. 
MEANWHILE...HIGHER LEVEL CLOUDS ARE APPROACHING FAIRLY QUICKLY FROM 
THE WEST AND MODELS INDICATING THIS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY SO 
JUST WENT WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES TODAY. 8H THERMAL ADVECTION 
REMAINS PRETTY MUCH NEUTRAL THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON SO THINK TEMPS 
WILL BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...PERHAPS A DEGREE OR SO WARMER. THIS 
IS PRETTY CLOSE TO WHAT GUIDANCE WAS SHOWING SO DID NOT STRAY TOO 
FAR. 

LOW LEVEL FLOW FORECAST TO BACK TO THE WEST AND THEN SOUTHWEST 
TONIGHT INTO MONDAY WITH WAA DEVELOPING. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A 
GRADUAL WARMUP FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY SO HAVE NUDGED UP TEMPS A BIT. 
BOTH THE ETA AND GFS HAVE TRENDED SLOWER WITH APPROACHING SYSTEM FOR 
MIDWEEK WITH THE GFS BEING SLOWER THAN THE ETA. BOTH NOW HAVE 
SURFACE LOW TRACKING A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE WEST AND KEEPING OUR 
AREA MORE IN THE WARM AIR. WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND HAVE SLOWED DOWN 
ONSET OF PCPN FOR TUESDAY AS BEST PDEFS GENERALLY REMAIN TO OUR WEST 
AND NORTHWEST THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. BETTER ISENT LIFT AND 
LOWERING PDEFS THEN OVERSPREAD OUR AREA FROM THE WEST THROUGH 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. BEST LIFT LOOKS TO BE LATE TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING SO WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS DURING THAT 
TIME FRAME. HAVE ALSO WARMED TEMPS UP FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY AND KEPT PCPN ALL RAIN. WITH SLOWER SOLUTION...HAVE 
LINGERED PCPN A LITTLE LONGER INTO WED NIGHT AND ALLOWED FOR A 
CHANGE OVER TO SNOW WED EVENING...PER AVN FORECAST SOUNDINGS. BY 
THIS TIME THOUGH... DEEPER MOISTURE PULLING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST SO 
DO NOT EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF SNOW ACCUMULATION. JGL

QUESTIONS ARE RELATIVELY MINOR WITH THIS AFTERNOONS FCST PACKAGE BUT 
THERE ARE SEVERAL TO BE RESOLVED. 

FIRST...LIKED IWXS THOUGHTS ON FOG TONIGHT WHERE SNOW PACK IS 
CURRENTLY AT. UNFORTUNATELY I CANT SEE EXACT EXTENT OF SNOW PACK 
DUE TO CLOUD COVER. HAVE THROWN A MENTION OF FOG IN FOR WEST CENTRAL 
OHIO AND TRIED TO KEEP IT CONTAINED RIGHT THERE. TEMPS WERE 
SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER ON THE GFS MODEL DUE TO SNOWPACK BUT IVE KEPT 
IT AROUND 20 FOR TONIGHTS LOWS TO KEEP IN LINE WITH SURROUNDING 
WFOS...WHICH IS JUST A SMIDGE WARMER THAN PREVIOUS FCST.

AXIS OF HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IS OVER FCST AREA DURING THE DAY SUNDAY 
AND IT LOOKS LIKE CLEAR/PARTLY CLOUDY IS THE WAY TO GO HERE WITH 
SOME INCREASING HIGH CLOUDS AND LITTLE TO NO LOWER LEVEL CU. 

SFC RIDGE PASSES EAST OF FCST AREA AND WAA WITH AN INCREASE IN SFC 
DEWPOINTS WILL BE NOTED BEGINNING SUN NITE. DONT THINK THAT THERES 
GOING TO BE THAT MUCH CLOUD COVER ON MON IN THE WARM SECTOR BUT HIGH 
CLOUDS COULD DROP IN ON NW FLOW AT THESE HIGHER LEVELS. 

LLVL JET SEEMS TO BRING IN MOISTURE BEGINNING LATE MON INTO THE 
DAYTIME HOURS TUESDAY. TRENDS FOR THE PAST FEW SYSTEMS WERE TO HOLD 
BACK TIMING AND IVE NEVER BEEN A FAN OF INCREASING OVERNIGHT POPS 
IN THE WARM SECTOR AHEAD OF APPROACHING CDFNTS. HAVE LEFT MENTION OF 
PRECIP OUT OVERNIGHT MON IN FAVOR OF DAYTIME TUESDAY.

&&

.LONG TERM...
SYSTEM ON TUESDAY IS NOW QUICKER THAN BEFORE.  ALTHOUGH THERE IS 
SOME DIFFERENCE IN THE ONSET OF PCPN TUE....THE MODELS SWEEP THE 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FA TUESDAY NGT.  ETA KEEPS THE EAST DRY ON 
TUESDAY...THE 00Z GFS WAS THE PCPN WELL INTO EASTERN OH BY 00Z WED 
AND TE 12Z GFS IS TE COMPROMISE.  WILL GO WITH THE 12Z GFS WILL WILL 
LIKELY POPS WEST AND CHC EAST.

AS FRONT SWINGS THROUGH TUE NGT...PCPN SHOULD CHANGE TO SNOW.  
SHOULDNT BE ANYTHING MAJOR...MAYBE AN INCH OR LESS...THEN MAYBE SOME 
SNOW SHOWERS ON WEDNESDAY.

HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES IN BRIEFLY ON THU...BEFORE A WEAK CLIPPER 
SWEEPS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON FRI.  ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM FOLLOWS 
QUICKLY ON ITS HEALS FOR SUNDAY.

THINGS LOOK...MAY HAVE TO HANG ON TO AN EARLY MENTION OF A FEW 
FLURRIES IN THE EAST. 

CLEARING JUST ABOUT INTO FAR NORTHWEST FA AND THIS SHOULD SLOWLY 
WORK INTO PARTS OF THE WEST THIS MORNING. ETA AND GFS BOTH SHOWING A 
QUICK REINFORCING SHOT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MOVING IN FROM THE 
NORTHWEST LATE THIS MORNING AND INTO THIS AFTERNOON. THIS IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK SHEARING OUT S/W ROTATING DOWN ACROSS LOWER

.SHORT TERM...
REGIONAL RADAR SHOWS DRY SLOT HAS WRAPPED INTO SOUTHERN PORTION OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. IN ADDITION ECHOES ARE DIMINISHING RATHER QUICKLY 
OFF TO THE WEST. APPEARS THAT THE RAIN SNOW LINE STRETCHES FROM 
ABOUT RICHMOND TO DAYTON TO DELAWARE AT THIS TIME.

MODELS SHOW FORCING RAPIDLY MOVING OFF TO THE EAST. SO EXPECT 
PRECIPITATION TO WIND DOWN THIS EVENING...ALTHOUGH IT MAY LINGER 
PAST MIDNIGHT IN EASTERN ZONES. HEAVIEST AMOUNTS WILL BE IN CENTRAL 
OHIO BUT IT WILL STILL TAKE SOME TIME FOR A CHANGE OVER TO SNOW. 
THUS BELIEVE THAT ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE AN INCH OR 
LESS FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA WITH LITTLE OR NO 
ACCUMULATION FOR THE SOUTH. HAD THOUGHT ABOUT UPGRADING TO A 
WARNING. BUT 4 INCH THRESHOLD IS FOR 12 HOURS AND THIS EVENT WILL BE 
LONGER THAN THAT. 24 HOUR THRESHOLD IS 6 INCHES WHICH WILL NOT BE 
REACHED. THUS AFTER FURTHER REVIEW WILL JUST CONTINUE WITH EXISTING 
ADVISORY.

MODELS SUGGEST THAT CLOUDS WILL START DIMINISHING IN THE MORNING 
BEFORE ONE LAST BAND OF STRATOCUMULUS SWINGS ACROSS THE AREA DURING 
THE DAY. SKIES SHOULD FINALLY CLEAR OUT DURING SATURDAY EVENING. 
SHOULD JUST SEE SOME MID AND HIGH CLOUDS SUNDAY INTO MONDAY AS 
RIDGING WORKS ACROSS THE REGION.

SNOW COVER ACROSS FAR NORTHERN ZONES WILL HAVE SOME IMPACT ON 
TEMPERATURES THE NEXT DAY OR SO AND HAVE MADE SOME DOWNWARD 
ADJUSTMENTS. OTHERWISE RAISED HIGHS A FEW DEGREES FOR TOMORROW AND 
STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS FORECAST NUMBERS FOR THE REMAINDER 
OF THE SHORT TERM PERIODS.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWING LOW PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL INDIANA 
AND CIRCULATION AROUND LOW ALSO EVIDENT ON REGIONAL RADAR LOOP. A 
BIT OF A DRY SLOT WORKING UP ACROSS SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF FA OUT 
AHEAD OF LOW...SO MAY SEE A PERIOD OF SOME BREAKS IN THE 
PCPN...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTH THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. 
HOWEVER...SHOULD THEN SEE PCPN SPREAD BACK INTO THE SOUTH THROUGH 
LATE MORNING AND INTO THIS AFTERNOON AS UPPER LEVEL LOW SHIFTS EAST 
INTO THE REGION. MEANWHILE...SURFACE LOW PROGGED TO CONTINUE TO 
PUSH EAST...MOVING ACROSS FA THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO TONIGHT 
TRACKING ALONG INTERSTATE 70. 

PCPN ACROSS FA SO FAR THIS MORNING HAS BEEN ALL RAIN...ALTHOUGH PCPN 
HAS CHANGED OVER TO SNOW JUST TO OUR NORTH FROM FWA TO DFI AND AOH. 
WITH SURFACE LOW TRACKING ALONG I-70...SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW OVER 
ALL BUT THE FAR NORTH SHOULD KEEP PCPN GENERALLY RAIN TODAY. 
EXCEPTION WILL BE ACROSS THE WAPOK GROUP WHERE PCPN SHOULD MIX WITH 
AND THEN CHANGE OVER TO ALL SNOW THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS...WITH 
COLDER AIR THEN BEGINNING TO FILTER DOWN INTO AREAS RIGHT ALONG 
I-70 THROUGH LATE AFTERNOON. ETA FORECAST SOUNDINGS AT CMH...CVG AND 
DAY ALL KEEP DEPTH OF FREEZING LEVEL NEAR OR ABOVE 1000 FEET THROUGH 
ABOUT 5 OR 6 PM THIS EVENING...SO THINK AT BEST WE WILL SEE A MIX 
THROUGH LATE AFTERNOON AT ALL THREE SITES....WITH PRETTY MUCH ALL 
RAIN SOUTHEAST OF I-71. LOW LEVEL THERMAL PROFILES THEN DROP OFF 
THROUGH THIS EVENING EVERYWHERE...SO EXPECT A FAIRLY QUICK CHANGE 
OVER TO SNOW THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...BY THIS TIME...LOOKS LIKE 
DEEPER MOISTURE AND FORCING BEGINS TO SHIFT OFF TO THE EAST.   

WITH ALL THIS IN MIND...THINK WE COULD END UP WITH AN INCH OR TWO OF 
ACCUMULATION BY LATE AFTERNOON FROM ABOUT GREENVILLE TO 
BELLEFONTAINE AND POINTS NORTH...WITH POSSIBLY ANOTHER INCH THROUGH 
EARLY THIS EVENING FOR A TOTAL OF 1 TO 3 INCHES AND WILL GO WITH A 
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT THERE. MEANWHILE... 
DELAWARE AND UNION COUNTIES LOOK TO BE ON THE FRINGE OF THE COLD AIR 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY THIS EVENING SO THINK THEY COULD END 
UP WITH 1 OR 2 TO LOCALLY THREE INCHES BEFORE THINGS TAPER OFF LATE 
THIS EVENING SO WILL ALSO GO WITH AN ADVISORY FOR THEM FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. EVERYWHERE ELSE..EXPECT CHANGEOVER TO BE LATE 
ENOUGH TO PREVENT ANY SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS. HOWEVER...WILL 
ALLOW FOR A BUFFER ZONE OF A COUPLE OF COUNTIES TO THE SOUTH FOR AN 
INCH OR LESS OF ACCUMULATION TONIGHT...WITH LITTLE OR NO 
ACCUMULATION EXPECTED ELSEWHERE.

WILL HAVE TO SEND AN UPDATE OUT JUST TO RESOLVE EVENING WORDING IN 
ZONES IF NOTHING ELSE.

LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION NOTED IN SOUTH CENTRAL INDIANA BASED ON RADAR 
RETURNS THIS EVENING. DEWPOINT GRADIENT IS QUITE PRONOUNCED AND SFC 
DEWPOINTS IN THE 40S WILL CONTINUE TO ADVECT JUST N OF THE OHRIVER 
TONIGHT. IN NRN CWA...DEWPOINTS IN THE 20S WILL INCREASE AS THE LOW 
STRENGTHENS LATER TONIGHT...BUT SHOULDNT REACH ABOVE THE FREEZING 
MARK AS SFC CIRCULATION REMAINS WELL SOUTH OF I-70 CORRIDOR. 

QUESTION HERE IS HOW TO WORD THE FCST TONIGHT. CATEGORICAL POPS ARE 
CURRENTLY RUNNING AND EVERYBODY SHOULD SEE SOME RAIN TONIGHT. FIRST 
OB WITH SNOW IN IT WAS AT 7 PM OVER FT WAYNE. SOME PELLETS WERE ALSO 
REPORTED OVER CENTRAL AND NRN INDIANA AS WELL. MODELS CONTINUE TO 
SUGGEST A WARM LOW LEVEL AND IM NOT GOING TO CHANGE CURRENT FCST. 
FEEL THAT NRN FCST AREA WITH MENTION OF MIXING LATE TONIGHT IS 
ENTIRELY REASONABLE. DONT EXPECT A TOTAL CHANGEOVER HERE UNTIL 
MAYBE JUST BEFORE DAYBREAK AS THE UPPER END OF THE 1000-850 
THICKNESS FOR SNOW AT 1305M IS PROGGED AT LIMA AT 6Z AND SLOWLY 
COOLS OFF THROUGH THE REST OF THE OVERNIGHT.

ONE OF MY CONCERNS WILL BE THE CATEGORICAL POPS WEVE GOT RUNNING IN 
KY ZONES. FEEL THAT MAJORITY OF THIS AREA WILL BE UNDER A PSEUDO DRY 
SLOT THAT IS EVIDENT OVER MUCH OF KY. WILL LOWER CHANCE OF RAIN HERE 
TONIGHT TO LIKELY 60-70% WHICH WILL COME IN LINE WITH SDF AND JKL TO 
MY SOUTH. 

HAVE SLIGHTLY MODIFIED TEMPS TONIGHT IN THE SOUTH. EXPECT THEM TO BE 
FAIRLY STEADY-STATE.

.SHORT TERM...
PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME MOVING INTO THE 
REGION WITH JUST SCATTERED ACTIVITY THIS AFTERNOON. EXPECT THIS TO 
CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING. BUT THEN 
PRECIPITATION SHIELD SHOULD FILL IN TOWARD MIDNIGHT AND BE FAIRLY 
SOLID THROUGH THE NIGHT ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS AND LOW LEVEL THICKNESS 
INDICATE THAT THIS SHOULD BE ALL IN THE FORM OF RAIN EXCEPT FOR THE 
FAR NORTHERN EDGE OF THE AREA WHERE THERE COULD BE A MIX WITH SNOW 
LATE TONIGHT.

ETA HAS COME INTO AGREEMENT WITH THE GFS THROUGH THE FIRST 24 HOURS 
OR SO BUT THEN IS QUICKER TO LIFT THE SYSTEM OUT. PREFER TO STICK 
WITH THE GFS TIMING. AT LEAST IN PART BECAUSE OF THE QUICKER 
SOLUTION THE LOW LEVELS OF THE ETA ARE COLDER WHICH WOULD RESULT IN 
A FASTER CHANGE OVER TO SNOW. HEDGED A LITTLE BIT IN THIS REGARD AND 
CHANGED THE PRECIPITATION OVER TO SNOW SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN WHAT THE 
PREFERRED GFS SOLUTION WOULD INDICATE.

SO HAVE GONE WITH A CHANGE TO ALL SNOW IN WEST CENTRAL OHIO DURING 
THE MORNING AND THEN CONTINUING INTO DAYTON AND COLUMBUS AREAS ON 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON. AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT LOCATIONS FROM 
CINCINNATI TO LANCASTER AND POINTS SOUTH WILL NOT CHANGE OVER TO 
SNOW UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING. EXPECT THE HEAVIER PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS 
TO FALL AS RAIN WHICH SHOULD LIMIT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. WILL CONTINUE 
TO GO WITH AROUND 2 INCHES IN THE NORTH AND 1 OR LESS IN THE SOUTH. 
WILL NOT ISSUE ANY ADVISORIES AT THIS TIME WAITING TO GET A LITTLE 
MORE CONFIDENCE IN ACCUMULATION TOTALS.

PRECIPITATION SHOULD DIMINISH RATHER QUICKLY ON FRIDAY EVENING AS 
ENERGY TRANSFERS TOWARD THE COASTAL SYSTEM. THEN EXPECT CLEARING TO 
SPREAD EASTWARD ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

LOW WILL SPIN DOWN FROM CANADA THROUGH KENTUCKY FRIDAY NIGHT THEN TO 
THE ATLANTIC COAST ON SATURDAY.  GFS...STILL THE MODEL OF 
CHOICE...HAS TRENDED SLIGHTLY SLOWER OVER THE LAST FEW RUNS.

SURFACE MAP HAS INVERTED TROF THAT IS ALMOST RIGHT UNDER MISSOURI 
MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE.  TROF WILL MOVE SLOWLY TOWARD ILN TODAY.  
THOUGH KILN RADAR IS DOWN FOR REPAIRS...SURROUNDING RADARS SHOW RAIN 
ADVANCING INTO THE AREA.  

AS THE H5 CUT OFF MOVES JUST SOUTH OF THE REGION...SURFACE LOW WILL 
INTENSIFY.  PREFERRED GFS HAS LOW CENTER NEAR THE OHIO RIVER FRIDAY 
18Z...WHILE THE ETA HAS THE PATH FARTHER NORTH NEAR I-70.  

FOR TODAY...WILL RAISE POPS TO 90/100 SOUTH AND KEEP 60/70 POPS 
NORTH WHERE AREAL COVERAGE WILL BE LOWER. KEEPING 100 POPS FOR 
TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY NIGHT.

MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE MORE RAIN THAN SNOW.  SLOWER SOLUTION 
FAVORS DELAYING CHANGE TO SNOW ON FRIDAY SO IVE BACKED OFF ON 
TIMING OF CHANGE OVER BY A COUPLE HOURS. LATER CHANGE OVER EQUALS 
LESS ACCUMULATION. OTHER FACTOR THAT WILL LIMIT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
ARE HIGH GROUND TEMPS. BEST CHANCE FOR SNOW IS EXPECTED TO BE LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN MOISTURE WILL BE DECREASING.  THEREFORE WE HAVE 
DECIDED AGAINST A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR NOW.

NOT MUCH TO SPEAK OF WITH CURRENT FCST. TRENDS ARE FOR ISENTROPIC 
LIFT TO CONTINUE OVER FCST AREA WITH THE MAJORITY OF LIFT 
CONCENTRATED IN SWRN CWA BETWEEN 6 AND 12Z. RAIN CURRENTLY OCCURRING 
OVER SRN IN SEEMS TO BE CORRESONDING WELL WITH 6Z APEX OF H8 JET 
MAXIMA. THIS MAX GETS SOMEWHAT WASHED OUT AS THE FOCUS TURNS TO 
SOUTHERN ENERGY MOVING THROUGH KY INTO SRN/SWRN FCST AREA. 

IT WILL STILL TAKE A WHILE TO SATURATE THE LLVLS AND ALLOW SHOWERS 
TO OVERSPREAD THE REGION. CURRENT WORDING HAS LATE MENTION...TOWARDS 
DAYBREAK AND THIS SHOULD STILL BE THE CASE FOR MOST OF SRN FCST 
AREA.

MODELS SEEMS TO BE CONVERGING ON A SOLUTION. STILL SOME MINOR 
DIFFERENCES IN PLACEMENT BUT OVERALL A BLEND SEEMS TO BE THE WAY TO 
GO. LOW LEVELS WILL BE WARMING SO PRECIPITATION WILL BE IN THE FORM 
OF RAIN THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. MODELS ARE A LITTLE SLOWER IN 
WRAPPING THE COLD AIR BACK IN ACROSS THE REGION WHICH SHOULD DELAY 
THE CHANGE OVER FROM RAIN TO SNOW. HOWEVER THERE IS STILL SOME 
UNCERTAINTY AS MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE SHOWING A DEEP ISOTHERMAL LAYER 
NEAR FREEZING. AND IF THE BOUNDARY LAYER ENDS UP JUST A BIT COOLER 
THEN THE CHANGE WILL BE EARLIER. 

FOR TONIGHT EXPECT RAIN TO SPREAD INTO THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE 
AREA LATE. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE BACK ABOVE FREEZING AFTER AN 
EVENING LOW. EXPECT RAIN TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE DAY ALTHOUGH FORCING WILL BE WEAKENING. THUS RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT. LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE A RELATIVE LULL 
IN PRECIPITATION THURSDAY EVENING BEFORE BETTER FORCING FROM 
APPROACHING SHORT WAVE MOVES TOWARDS THE REGION LATE IN THE NIGHT. 
PRECIPITATION FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY INTO 
FRIDAY EVENING BEFORE STARTING TO TAPER OFF LATER IN THE NIGHT. 
GIVEN LATEST THINKING ON CHANGE OVER FOR PRECIPITATION LOOKS LIKE 
SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WOULD BE IN THE ADVISORY RANGE.

WEAK UPPER RIDGE WILL MOVE ACROSS ILN CWA TODAY.  SHORT WAVE 
DROPPING TOWARD MISSOURI THIS MORNING WILL INFLUENCE OUR WEATHER ON 
THURSDAY.  CUT OFF LOW IS THEN PROGGED TO RACE SOUTHEAST ON FRIDAY. 
MODELS DIFFER ON THE STRENGTH AND PATH OF THE CUT OFF...WITH THE GFS 
DROPPING THE CUT OFF FARTHER SOUTH THROUGH TENNESSEE AND THE 
CAROLINAS...WHILE THE ETA HAS A TRACK THROUGH KENTUCKY AND VIRGINIA. 
GFS INITIALIZED BETTER (SEE PMDHMD) AND IT IS THE MODEL OF CHOICE AT 
THIS POINT.

SURFACE MAP HAS HIGH PRESSURE MOVING EAST OF THE AREA.  INVERTED 
TROF WILL DEVELOP TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE FIRST SHORT WAVE.  TROF WILL 
MOVE SLOWLY TOWARD ILN TONIGHT AND THURSDAY.  IT WILL THEN REMAIN 
NEARLY STATIONARY AS THE CUT OFF CRUISES SOUTHEAST AND PROVIDES 
ADDITIONAL UPPER SUPPORT ON FRIDAY. 

SKY CONDITION WILL MOSTLY CLOUDY TODAY.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR 
LATE TONIGHT IN THE SOUTH. LIKELY POPS ARE NOW APPROPRIATE FOR 
THURSDAY.  WILL GO WITH 80 POPS FOR FRIDAY WITH EVENT BECOMING MORE 
CERTAIN.  

TRICKY PRECIP TYPE FORECAST. GOING WITH JUST RAIN THURSDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS IT APPEARS ABOVE FREEZING TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
DEEP ENOUGH FOR ALL RAIN.  TRANSITION TO SNOW WILL OCCUR FRIDAY AS 
COLDER AIR BEGINS TO WRAP SOUTHWARD.  HEAVIEST SNOW IS EXPECTED OVER 
NORTHERN COUNTIES CLOSER TO DEFORMATION ZONE.  MODEL SOUNDINGS DO 
NOT INDICATE ANY WARM AIR ALOFT SO I THINK THAT WE WILL SEE RAIN AND 
SNOW BUT NO SLEET OR FREEZING RAIN.

MAIN PROBLEM WITH FCST APPEARS TO BE WITH UPCOMING SYSTEM LATER THIS 
WEEK. MID LEVEL S/W GETS CAUGHT IN NW FLOW AND BASICALLY MOISTENS UP 
THE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH WED NIGHT. SFC FEATURES START TO COME 
TOGETHER IN THE PLAINS ON THURS...WITH A PSEUDO WARM FRONT OVER SRN 
FCST AREA BEING THE FOCUS FOR ACTIVITY DURING THE DAY. DUE TO DRY 
AMS ALREADY IN PLACE, HAVE NOT GONE LIKEY UNTIL THURS NIGHT WITH ANY 
PRECIPITATION. COULD SEE THE ARGUEMENT FOR LIKELY ON THURS OVER THE 
SRN 1/3 OF FCST AREA ALONG OH RIVER...BUT WANTED TO WAIT TO SEE A 
MORE PRONOUNCED MID LEVEL FEATURE THAN JUST THE LLVL WMFNT TO GO 
HIGHER THAN CHANCE POPS. THINKING HERE IS THAT PLACEMENT COULD RANGE 
QUITE A BIT FURTHER N OR S. 

FOR THE 4 LETTER S WORD, CURRENT MODEL RUNS HAVE SFC LOW TRACKING 
THROUGH FCST AREA WITH NO GREAT CONSENSUS ON EXACTLY WHERE. GFS IS 
MOST PROGRESSIVE, BUT EVEN WITH A PERFECT PROG HERE, SNOW WILL HOLD 
OFF UNTIL THICKNESSES START TO DROP DURING THE DAY FRIDAY. HAVE JUST 
PUT IN THE SNOW CHANCE FOR AREAS NW OF DAYTON THURS PM. 

CHANGEOVER WILL LIKELY SEE SOME SORT OF A MIX FOR MOST AREAS ON 
FRIDAY. FCST HAS MIX TIMED BY AFTERNOON IN MOST PLACES WITH A 
LEFTOVER EVENING MENTION IN THE PMH GROUP.

LATEST GFS STILL ADVERTISING UPR CLOSED LOW TO DIVE SE FROM THE NRN

SOUNDINGS...A RAIN/SNOW MIX FROM OUR NW CWFA WILL GRADUALLY CHANGE 
TO SNOW DURING THE MORNING HOURS...WHILE RAIN ELSEWHERE WILL 
GRADUALLY MIX WITH SNOW AS THE DAY PROGRESS (DUE TO PERTURBED SFC 
LOW MOVING FROM SRN OHIO INTO W VA...ALLOWING FOR COLDER AIR TO

SKIES WERE CLEAR ACROSS THE FCST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AS HIGH 
PRESSURE WAS BUILDING.  DEW POINTS HAVE PLUNGED INTO THE TEENS.  

NO BIG CHANGES TO TEMPS OVER THE SHORT TERM.  DISPITE THE LACK OF 
CLOUDS...WINDS WILL KEEP TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 20S OVERNIGHT.  THE 
ETA AND GFS SHOW SOME HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE BRUSHING THE FAR SW LATE 
TONIGHT.  HOWEVER...OMEGA PROFILES SHOW SINKING AIR THROUGHOUT THE 
LAYER.

ON TUESDAY..ETA SNDGS AND CU RULE ARE AGAIN UNFAVORABLE FOR CU. MAV 
GUIDANCE...THE RAW ETA...AND CORRELATED LOW LEVEL THICKESSES ALL IN 
LINE WITH CURRENT FCST OF MID 30S TO NEAR 40 IN THE SOUTH.  SOME 
HIGH CLOUDS MAY WORK INTO THE SW LATE.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT.  THE MAINLY 
CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO FALL INTO THE TEENS 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA.  BOTH THE ETA AND GFS HAVE HIGH AND MID 
LEVEL MOISTURE CONTINUING TO STREAM INTO THE SW...ALTHOUGH IT IS 
SHARPLY CONFINED HERE. OMEGA PROFILES SHOW SOME RISING AIR IN THE 
LAYER LATE...SO CLOUDS MAY KEEP THE SW A BIT WARMER.

IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE COLD ON WEDNESDAY...WITH MAINLY HIGH CLOUDS 
ON THE INCREASE FOR THE WHOLE FCST AREA.

.LONG TERM...
STILL CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WITH THE SYSTEM AT THE END OF THE 
WEEK. MODELS ARE MOVING THE SYSTEM IN QUICKER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS 
BRINGING LOW INTO OHIO VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT. BROUGHT PRECIPITATION 
IN EARLIER THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST BEGINNING IT IN THE WEST AS SNOW 
JUST BEFORE 12Z FRIDAY. EXPECT PRECIPITATION TO BE A MIX FRIDAY 
MORNING CHANGING TO RAIN FRIDAY AFTERNOON. RAIN WILL CHANGE BACK TO 
SNOW FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL CONTINUE CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE OF MAINLY SNOW

DISSIPATING THIS AFTERNOON.  TEMPS HAVE RECOVERED INTO THE 50S 
THROUGHOUT THE FCST AREA WITH THE DECREASED SKY COVER AND WAA IN 
ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT.

THE COLD FRONT WILL PASS ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT...BRINGING A COLDER 
AIR MASS TO THE REGION AS SKIES CONTINUE TO CLEAR.  DESPITE THE LACK 
OF CLOUD COVER...CURRENT FCST LOW TEMPS IN L0W 30S STILL LOOK FINE 
AS WINDS DO NOT DROP OFF THAT MUCH OVERNIGHT...ALTHOUGH THE 
INVERSION SHOULD BUFFER THE SFC SOMEWHAT FROM THE CONSIDERABLE 30-40 
KT 850 MB WINDS. 

SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY TO SUNNY ON MONDAY BEHIND THE FRONT.  
ETA FCST SNDGS AND CU RULE NOT FAVORABLE FOR ANY CU AND EVEN ANY CI 
LOOKS TO BE VERY SPARSE AT BEST.  ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE DECENT 
CAA...WILL GO SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN THE COOL MAV TEMPS WITH MORE 
OPTIMISTIC SKY COVER THAN MAV EXPECTS. 

HIGH AND MID CLOUDINESS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE TUESDAY.  LOW LEVEL 
THICKNESSES ARE ABOUT THE SAME AS MONDAY.  GUIDANCE SUPPORTS COOLER 
TEMPS THAN ON MONDAY AND THIS LOOKS REASONABLE GIVEN THE CLOUD COVER.

CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK WITH LARGE

THE RATHER STUBBORN LOW CLOUD DECK IS NOW ERODING IN THE SW. THE SC

HIGH CLOUDS THEN WORK IN FROM THE WEST.  TEMPS WILL NOT DROP MUCH 
OVERNIGHT AS THE WINDS STAY UP IN THE SW FLOW...BUT MAV GUIDANCE 
LOOKS DISTINCTLY TOO HIGH AS AFTERNOON TEMPS TODAY WILL WILL NOT GET 
MUCH (IF AT ALL) ABOVE MAV LOWS FOR MOST OF THE AREA.

MAINLY HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE SUNDAY IN 
ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT.  IN COMPARISON...THE GFS 
BRINGS MUCH MORE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE THAN THE ETA DOES...PARTICULARLY 
IN THE NORTH AND EAST.  THE WAA WILL BE DAMPED A BIT BY THE CLOUD 
COVER...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH...AND TEMPS WILL RANGE FROM THE 
UPPER 40S TO LOW 50S IN THE FAR SOUTH. 

HAVE LOWERED TEMPS FOR MONDAY AS GUIDANCE HAS COME IN MUCH COOLER

SHORT WAVE MOVING OUT OF THE UPPER MIDWEST WILL MOVE ACROSS THE

FORCING WILL BE IN THE UPPER LEVELS. BUT SEVERAL GFS RUNS HAVE SHOWN 
MOISTENING THROUGH THE DEPTH OF THE COLUMN WITH TIME. SO BELIEVE 
THAT LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES ARE WARRANTED FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW.

NEXT SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE REGION TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK. 
LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE SOME SHOWERS IN WESTERN SECTIONS ON FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON WHICH THEN SPREAD EASTWARD THROUGH THE NIGHT. WILL KEEP 
PRECIPITATION ALL RAIN AT THIS POINT. THICKNESS WILL HAVE RISEN

ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW FLAKES MIXING IN. THE ONE EXCEPTION 
APPEARS TO BE ON THE BACK EDGE OF THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD WHERE 
THERE IS A BRIEF TRANSITION TO SNOW BEFORE ENDING. 

THERE SHOULD BE A BREAK IN THE PRECIPITATION BEFORE WRAP AROUND SNOW

.SHORT TERM...
CURRENT RADAR IMAGES SHOWING BACK EDGE OF PCPN SINKING SLOWLY 
SOUTHEAST TOWARD NORTHWEST PORTIONS OF FA WHILE RAIN ALSO TRYING TO 
BREAK UP SOMEWHAT ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF AREA. WITH FIRST 
WAVE LIFTING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST THROUGH EARLY EVENING...EXPECT A 
GENERAL DECREASE IN ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. 
HOWEVER...BOTH ETA AND GFS NOW SHOWING A COUPLE OF MORE WAVES RIDING 
UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST LATER TONIGHT AND INTO FRIDAY MORNING. THUS 
EXPECT PCPN TO REDEVELOP LATER THIS EVENING AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE 
OVERNIGHT...WITH HIGHEST POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST. THESE WAVES HAVE 
HELPED SLOW THE FRONT FROM PUSHING THROUGH AND AS A RESULT THE CAA 
WILL HOLD OFF SO PCPN SHOULD REMAIN ALL RAIN TONIGHT. 

THINGS GET A LITTLE INTERESTING ON FRIDAY AS GFS A LITTLE STRONGER 
AND FURTHER WEST THAN ETA WITH FINAL WAVE MOVING UP ALONG THE 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. AS A RESULT...GFS KEEPS 
OUR AREA IN REGION OF A LITTLE BETTER LIFT/DEEPER MOISTURE AND IS 
CRANKING OUT A LITTLE MORE PCPN THAN ETA. MEANWHILE...CAA 
OVERSPREADS AREA THROUGH THE LATE MORNING AND INTO EARLY AFTERNOON. 
LOW LEVEL THICKNESS TRENDS SHOWING A FAIRLY EARLY CHANGEOVER TO SNOW 
THROUGH LATE MORNING BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS HANGING ON TO A DEEP 
ENOUGH WARM LAYER IN THE LOW LEVELS TO KEEP PCPN MOSTLY RAIN UNTIL 
AFTERNOON. SO...WILL GENERALLY GO WITH PCPN MIXING WITH AND THEN 
CHANGING OVER TO SNOW FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS AREA MAINLY THROUGH 
THE AFTERNOON. SINCE BULK OF PCPN SHOULD BE TAPERING OFF BY THE THE 
TIME OF CHANGEOVER...THINK ANY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE LIMITED. 
HOWEVER...IF THE GFS ENDS UP BEING RIGHT...POSSIBILITY WOULD EXIST 
FOR AN INCH OR SO OF ACCUMULATION.

GOOD CYCLONIC LOW LEVEL FLOW SETS UP FOR FRI NIGHT WITH BOTH ETA AND 
GFS CLOSING OFF 5H LOW...THOUGH GFS A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH WITH IT. 
AT ANY RATE...THINK CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE INTO FRI 
NIGHT WITH SOME MINIMAL ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE.

HAVE BUMPED TEMPS UP A LITTLE FOR TONIGHT AND THEN ALLOWED FOR 
SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS ON FRI AS CAA A LITTLE SLOWER MOVING IN AND NOW 
FOCUSED MORE DURING THE DAY.

&&

.LONG TERM...
CONFIDENCE IN FCST DROPS SIGNIFICANTLY FOR DAYS 5-7. MRF SOLUTIONS 
FROM THE ENSEMBLES ARE PRETTY MUCH ALL OVER THE BOARD. 5 OUT OF THE 
12 RUNS FOR MONDAY HAS STRONG SFC HIGH PRESSURE OVER WRN U.S. AND 
RIDGING IN THE EAST WITH WAA IN OHVLY AND A GOOD TROF IN THE 
MIDWEST. THIS WOULD SUGGEST STRONG WAA AND SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASED 
CHANCE OF PRECIP DURING THIS TIME. HOWEVER...OPERATIONAL RUN IS MORE 
OR LESS SHOWING SFC HIGH OVER THE MIDWEST BUILDING TOWARDS THE TN 
VLY WITH A WEAK H5 DISTURBANCE SNEAKING W-E THROUGH THE NRN GTLKS 
REGION DURING THIS TIME WITH A DECENT SHOT OF CAA ON WNW WINDS. 

WITH SO MUCH VARIABILITY, HAVE KEPT THE FCST DRY PER SURROUNDING 
FCST OFFICES COLLABORATION. TEMPERATURES WILL BE FCST TOWARDS 
CLIMATOLOGY AS THERES NOTHING TO NOTE A WARM OR COLD TREND EXCEPT 
FOR THE HIGHER AMPLIFIED PATTERN OF THE GFS.

PRECIP CONTINUES TO FALL ACROSS THE WESTERN AND NORTHERN PORTION OF 
OUR FA AS A RESULT OF LOW LEVEL JET AND FAIRLY STRONG ISENTROPIC 
LIFT. LATEST RUC INDICATES THIS SHOULD WEAKEN SOMEWHAT AFTER 
12Z...BUT FORCING AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING FRONT WILL BECOME 
REESTABLISHED AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. THIS WILL ALLOW CATAGORICAL 
PRECIP TO SPREAD W-E DURING THE DAY. ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS INDICATES 
THAT PRECIP WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE INTO THE SE PORTION OF OUR FA...AS 
PDEFS REMAIN RATHER HIGH UNTIL THEN.

OVERALL THE GFS APPEARS TO BE THE PREFERRED MODEL. THE ETA HAS BEEN 
CONSISTENTLY SLOWING DOWN THE FRONT...AND BECOMING MORE IN LINE WITH 
THE GFS SOLUTION. THE GFS HAS BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTANT OVER THE 
LAST SEVERAL RUNS WITH POSITIONING OF THIS SYSTEM...WHEREAS THE ETA 
HAS NOT.

WITH THE SLOW MOVING FRONT...AND A POTENTIAL WAVE DEVELOPING ALONG 
THE FRONT...EXPECT OCCASIONAL SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE RUC 
HAS BEEN NOTING BDRY LAYER CAPE VALUES IN EXCESS OF 300 J/KG ACROSS 
SRN AND SW IN DURING THE NIGHT. THIS HAS RESULTED IN IMBEDDED 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THIS AREA. IT APPEARS THIS INSTABILITY SHOULD 
DIMINISH...SO HAVE NOT MENTIONED THUNDER IN FCST.

AS THE FRONTAL SYSTEM AND ACCOMPANYING LOW PUSH EAST OF OUR AREA 
LATE TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...COLDER AIR WILL MOVE IN. CRITICAL 
THICKNESS AND MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE POTENTIAL FOR SNOW TO MIX 
WITH THE RAIN BEGINNING IN THE NW LATE TONIGHT/EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. 
THIS CHANGE-OVER SHOULD CONTINUE TO ADVANCE SOUTHEASTWARD. NO 
ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED.

EXPECT TEMPS TO RISE ONLY SLIGHTLY ON FRIDAY...WITH COLD UNSTABLE 
AIR IN PLACE EXPECT CHC OF RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS DURING THE DAY AND 
POSSIBLY INTO THE EVENING.

OHIO AND WIND GUSTS BEHIND FRONT GUSTING TO 25KTS.  KILN SHOWING 
PRECIP IS POST FRONTAL.

MODELS ARE ALL IN DESCENT AGREEMENT WITH SWINGING COLD FRONT THROUGH

TEMPERATURES THROUGH OUT THE DAY WITH HIGHS AT 12Z.  A BRIEF PERIOD 
OF LIGHT SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH MID MORNING ON THE BACK SIDE 
OF PRECIPITATION SHIELD.  A FEW FLURRIES WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH 
NOON WITH FLOW OFF GREAT LAKES AND SOLID STRATA CU DECK.  SKIES WILL 
CLEAR OVERNIGHT ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO FALL OFF INTO THE LOWER 
20S.  THIS WILL BE THE COLDEST AIR SO FAR THIS SEASON.

NEXT THREAT OF PRECIP WILL COME WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS UPPER TROF 
DEEPENS OVER THE UPPER MS VLY PULLS MOISTURE OUT OF THE GULF.  
THREAT WILL CONTINUE INTO THANKSGIVING.

.SHORT TERM...
GFS/ETA ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR WITH TIMING OF COLD FRONT...WHICH AT 
19Z...WAS LOCATED FROM CNTRL WISCONSIN...SOUTH THROUGH CNTRL IL...SE 
MO...ERN ARKANSAS...THEN INTO LOUISIANA.  THERE WILL BE A DECENT 
AREA OF LOW LVL CONVERGENCE ALONG AND BEHIND THE FRONT.  THIS WILL 
RESULT IN WIDESPREAD SHOWERS OVERNIGHT AND INTO MONDAY MORNING.  
SINCE PCPN SHOULD BE CONFINED TO ALONG AND BEHIND THE FRONT...HAVE 
DELAYED PCPN SOME FROM PREVIOUS FCST.  SFC LI AND SFC CAPE REALLY 
DWINDLE BY THE TIME THE FRONT ARRIVES ACRS THE WRN CWFA TONIGHT...SO 
WILL ONLY CONTINUE A SLIGHT CHC OF THUNDER THERE.

COLD FRONT WILL TRAVERSE CWFA DURING THE MORNING HOURS MONDAY 
...BEING EAST OF THE CWFA AROUND 15Z. METEOROLOGICAL INTUITION 
BELIEVES THAT PCPN MAY VERY WELL END BEFORE ANY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW 
OCCURS.  SINCE WE HAVE AT LEAST KEPT A SLIGHT CHC FOR A CHANGEOVER 
OVER THE LAST SVRL DAYS...WILL CONTINUE THIS THINKING SO AS NOT TO 
YO-YO AT THIS POINT.  MIDNIGHT SHIFT WILL BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF A 
THIN BAND OF RAIN AND SNOW FORMS BEFORE PCPN ENDS. TEMPS WILL BE 
TRICKY AS STRONG CAA DEVELOPS OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VLY 
REGION IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT.  THUS...AM EXPECTING A WINDY DAY 
WITH GUSTS NEAR 40 MPH POSSIBLE ON MONDAY.  JUST A 
REMINDER...OFFICIAL LOWS GO THROUGH 13Z (8 AM)...WHILE OFFICIAL 
HIGHS START AT 12Z (7 AM)...SO THIS WILL BE REFLECTED IN THE CODED 
CITIES FCST VALUES (CCFILN).  HOWEVER...WITH ZONES BROKEN UP FROM 6 
PM TO 6 AM TO 6 PM...ETC...THIS WILL BE TRANSPARENT.  THUS...WILL 
HAVE FALLING TEMPS ON MONDAY.  

SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE OHIO VLY REGION MONDAY 
NIGHT...ALLOWING FOR TEMPS TO PLUMMET INTO THE 15 TO 20 DEGREE RANGE.

AS THE SFC HIGH MOVES EAST ON TUESDAY...EXPECT A SLOW WARM UP AS 
LOW LVL FLOW RETURNS TO A SOUTHERLY COMPONENT.  HIGH CLOUDS 
STREAMING IN FROM THE WEST ON TUESDAY SHOULD RESULT IN PARTLY CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS.  SFH

.LONG TERM...
FOCUS FOR THE LONG TERM IS WITH WEAK SYSTEM PUSHING ACROSS THE 
REGION THROUGH MID WEEK. LATEST MODELS A LITTLE STRONGER WITH 
AMPLIFICATION AND ASSOCIATED S/W AND AS A RESULT THEIR TREND OF 
SLOWING THINGS DOWN HAS ALSO CONTINUED. HAVE THEREFORE PUSHED BACK 
PCPN UNTIL LATE WED NIGHT AND THEN CONTINUED IT THROUGH MOST OF THE 
DAY ON THURSDAY. FORCING ALSO APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY BETTER SO HAVE 
BUMPED UP POPS FOR THURSDAY BACK INTO THE CHANCE CATEGORY. 

STILL LOOKS LIKE MAJORITY OF ANY PCPN SHOULD BE IN LIQUID FORM BUT 
THICKNESSES AND 8H TEMPS APPEAR COLD ENOUGH FOR A POSSIBLE MIX 
ACROSS THE FAR NORTHWEST...MAINLY LATE WED NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY 
MORNING. 12Z GFS SHOWING A WEAK SECONDARY S/W DROPPING DOWN ACROSS 
AREA FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND THAT COULD BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW 
LIGHT SHOWERS. WILL LEAVE IT DRY FOR NOW BUT IF WE WERE TO SEE PCPN 
THURSDAY NIGHT...LOW LEVEL THERMAL PROFILES APPEAR COLD ENOUGH TO 
SUPPORT MAINLY SNOW. 

HAVE KEPT REMAINDER OF FORECAST DRY AS DEVELOPING WEST COAST TROF 
SHOULD SLOW DOWN EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF SYSTEM FOR LATE IN THE 
WEEKEND AND THINK ANY PCPN LIKELY TO HOLD OFF UNTIL AT LEAST SUN 
NIGHT.  JGL

SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON DEPICTED A MIX OF STRATOCUMULUS AND 
CIRRUS.  AM EXPECTING MAINLY CIRRUS CLOUDS TONIGHT...VARYING FROM 
MOSTLY CLOUDY NW TO PARTLY CLOUDY SE.  TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ON 
THE MILD SIDE WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS RANGING FROM THE MID 40S TO LOWER 
50S.

ONE MORE VERY WARM DAY CAN BE EXPECTED ON SUNDAY IN THE WAA AHEAD OF 
A STRONG COLD FRONT OVER THE MS VLY REGION.  GFS IS SHOWING VERY 
LIGHT PCPN OVER THE NW DURING THE AFTN...WHILE THE ETA IS DRY.  WILL 
GO WITH THE DRY SOLUTION AT THIS POINT SINCE THERE REALLY ISNT ANY 
FORCING TO SPEAK OF ON SUNDAY.  TEMPS WILL RANGE FROM THE MID 60S N 
TO THE LOWER 70S SOUTH.

GFS/ETA FAIRLY SIMILAR WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY 
MONDAY MORNING.  WITH GOOD LOW LVL FORCING...HAVE BUMPED POPS UP 
INTO THE PREDOMINANT CATEGORY (75 TO 80 PERCENT CHANCE).  IT LOOKS 
LIKE THERE COULD BE A BRIEF 1 TO 2 HOUR PERIOD OF RAIN AND SNOW 
MIXED TOGETHER AS COLD AIR RUSHES RAPIDLY INTO THE REGION.  WILL 
ALSO CONTINUE A SLIGHT CHC FOR TSRA OUT AHEAD AND JUST BEHIND THE 
FRONT.  IT WILL ALSO BE VERY WINDY BEHIND THE FRONT...WHICH WILL 
CONTINUE INTO THE DAYLIGHT HOURS ON MONDAY.

PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED ON 
MONDAY.  HAVE OPTED FOR ONLY A SLIGHT CHC OF RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS MIXED 
EARLY IN THE EAST...OTHERWISE DRY CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL.  MONDAY 
NIGHTS LOWS WILL BE VERY COLD...DIPPING INTO THE TEENS AND LOWER 20S 
AS SKIES CLEAR AND SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACRS THE MIDDLE OHIO VLY.

RUN. WILL THEREFORE TRIM POPS BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE AND LIMIT 
MENTION TO JUST WED NIGHT INTO EARLY THURSDAY. THICKNESS SCHEMES 
SUPPORTING A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW ACROSS THE NORTHWEST HALF OF FA 
WITH THIS SYSTEM BUT 8H TEMPS GENERALLY REMAIN ABOVE ZERO UNTIL CAA

BASICALLY A TEMP FORECAST FOR THE FIRST TWO DAYS...AND WITH GUIDANCE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT...NOT MUCH TO DO THERE EITHER. MAINLY HIGH CI OVER 
THE CWA...WITH THICKER CI TO NORTH. APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH CI UP 
STREAM TO GO PARTLY CLOUDY WORDING IN ZONES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
THE SOUTHERN CWA WHERE CI WILL BE A LITTLE HARDER TO COME BY.

THINGS DO GET MORE INTERESTING AS A SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH MOVES 
THROUGH THE PLAINS...DEVELOPING A STRONG SYSTEM FOR THE REGION TO 
CONTEND WITH SUNDAY AND MONDAY. POPS ARE INTRODUCED IN WESTERN 
PORTIONS OF THE CWA ON SUNDAY...THEN INCREASED POPS FROM THERE 
STICKING MAINLY TO GUIDANCE VALUES. ALSO ADDED IN CHANCE FOR THUNDER 
AS AREA IS UNDER SLIGHT RISK PER SPC.

GOOD BLAST OF COLD AIR RUSHES IN ON THE BACK OF SOME STRONG WINDS 
MONDAY. THICKNESS PATTERNS SHOW 1305 THICKNESS LINE (1000 TO 850MB) 
WELL AHEAD OF THE 540 THICKNESS LINE AS COLD FRONT PUSHES THROUGH 
MONDAY. EXPECT A MORNING HIGH TEMP...AND WITH TEMPERATURES DROPPING 
THROUGH THE DAY MAY EVEN SEE A FEW FLAKES IF THE COLD AIR CAN GET IN 
FAST ENOUGH...AS IT APPEARS THAT IT WILL.

FOR THE EXTENDED...UPPER AIR PATTERN IS PROGRESSIVE. THE NEXT SW/V 
AND ASSOCIATED SFC SYSTEM SHOULD CROSS THE REGION ON WED NIGHT/EARLY 
ON THANKSGIVING MORNING. MAY NOT BE REAL STRONG...AND WITH COLDER 
AIR IN PLACE CANT RULE OUT CHANCE FOR RAIN...SNOW SHOWERS. WENT

MENTION THE THREAT OF WINDS WITH PASSAGE OF FRONT...VERY SIMILAR TO 
MOST RECENT FROPA OVER OHVLY WITH A GOOD WARM SECTOR WIND. THIS NEXT 
SYSTEM SEEMS TO HAVE A MUCH STRONGER COLD PUSH BEHIND IT 
HOWEVER...AND THE CURRENT THINKING IS FOR THIS ONE TO PACK A BIT 
MORE PUNCH THAN THE ONE THAT WENT THROUGH THE OTHER NIGHT WITH A 
WEAKER COLD POOL INFLUENCE. 

TEMPS TODAY WILL BE INTERESTING. NO WAY WERE GOING TO MIX VERY 
HIGH, BUT HAVE ERRED ON THE WARM SIDE FOR MAX TEMPS...APPROACHING 60 
IN CENTRAL OH TO ALMOST MID 60S TOWARDS SDFS AREA. FULL SUN WAS THE 
THINKING HERE. HAVE RAISED TEMPS TONIGHT WITH THE THOUGHT OF CI 
BUILDING OVER NRN CWA. 

INCREASE IN TEMPS EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. BY 
SAT...MIXING SHOULD REACH 850 MB OR SO AND HIGH TEMPS SHOULD BE IN 
THE 60S FOR MOST AREAS. HAVE NOT CHANGED CURRENT FCST AT THIS TIME 
SINCE IT WAS ALREADY GOOD...BUMPED HIGHS AND LOWS SLIGHTLY EACH DAY 
TO COME IN LINE BY SATURDAY.

IN ALL...NO SWEEPING CHANGES MADE.

SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS EVENING INDICATED CLEAR SKIES OVER THE REGION 
AS A SFC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WAS BUILDING EAST INTO THE AREA.  
ATMOSPHERE ALOFT WILL REMAIN DRY ...SO CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL 
CONTINUE OVERNIGHT.  WEST WINDS BETWEEN 10 TO 15 MPH WERE STILL 
OBSERVED...AND THESE SHOULD BEGIN TO DIMINISH BETWEEN 06Z AND 09Z (1 
AM TO 4 AM)...IN WHICH DECOUPLING SHOULD TAKE PLACE.  CURRENT FCST 
HAS MENTION OF PATCHY FOG...AND THIS LOOKS OK.  FOG SHOULD REMAIN IN 
THE PATCHY RANGE AS PREVIOUS AFTN SUNSHINE AND CURRENT WINDS HAVE 
ALLOWED FOR SOME DRYING.  FCST LOWS ARE ALSO ON TRACK.  AN EVENING

SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. EUROPEAN MODEL AND GFS ENSEMBLE ARE 
INDICATING A FASTER MOVEMENT THAN THE LAST SEVERAL RUNS OF THE

TOWARDS THE FASTER SOLUTION. SO THIS WOULD HAVE THE FRONT IN WESTERN 
OHIO BY MONDAY MORNING. EXPECT A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS WITH 
THIS SYSTEM AND A LARGE TEMPERATURE CONTRAST. COLD AIR MOVING IN 
QUICKLY BEHIND THE FRONT MAY RESULT IN A MIX OR CHANGE TO SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE WRAP AROUND PRECIPITATION WHICH SHOULD END BY MONDAY 
EVENING. AFTER A COLD DAY TUESDAY EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO REBOUND

TRIED TO MAKE GRIDS WHAT I WAS THINKING WITH FCST. EXPECT HEAVY RAIN 
POSSIBLE IN SOUTH AND EAST...DIDNT CHANGE WX TYPE IN CMH TO HEAVY 
SINCE WATCH WAS TO THEIR SOUTH AND NOT THERE. MAY MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT 
POST-GFE. CAN SEE AN ARGUMENT TO KEEP FAR SWRN FCST AREA OUT OF 
FLOOD WATCH BUT AM ERRING ON THE SIDE OF CAUTION. 

LITTLE INSTABILITY TO DEAL WITH. EXPECT SHOWERS TODAY AND TONIGHT 
FOR MUCH OF CWA. A PERIOD OF THUNDER SHOULD OCCUR MOST PLACES AND 
CANT BE RULED OUT ANYWHERE BUT IM GOING TO TRY AND PLAY IT DOWN AS 
IT WONT THUNDER FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF TIME. MAJORITY OF 
INSTABILITY WILL BE FOCUSED IN MICHIGAN AND ALABAMA WITH US IN THE 
SPLITSVILLE REGION. THIS DOESNT MEAN THAT WE WONT BE ADVECTING 
SOME SERIOUS MOISTURE ON SCREAMING 850 WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT. 
CHANCE OF SEVERE CANT BE RULED OUT BUT CURRENT MODELS SUGGEST THAT 
THE HELICITY IS SOMEWHAT SEPARATED FROM THE INSTABILITY IN THE MID 
LEVELS. WILL NOT PLAY UP WIND POTENTIAL AS THE BEST WINDS ARE IN THE 
WARM SECTOR AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND NOT NECESSARILY IN THE SHOWERS 
THAT COULD BRING THEM TO THE SFC. 

TEMPERATURES ARE GOING TO STAY UP UNTIL FROPA LATE TONIGHT. HAVE 
ADJUSTED GRIDS TO SUIT. DONT THINK THAT WINDS WILL BE A BIG PLAYER 
IN THE COLD AIR BEHIND THE FRONT...CAA ISNT THE STRONGEST. THIS 
WOULD ALSO LIMIT AMOUNT OF (OR EVEN PRESENCE OF) CLOUDS FOR THE 
WEDNESDAY/WED PM PERIOD. 

MODELS GO SOUTH AFTER THIS POINT WITH THE ETA SPINNING THE LOW OVER 
THE GULF STATES AND THE GFS MOVING IT OUT TO THE ATLANTIC. HAVE 
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE HERE AS THINGS (CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP) SHOULD 
STAY OUT OF FCST AREA EVEN IF INCREASED MOISTURE MAKES ITS WAY TO 
THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE APPALACHIANS. DOWNSLOPE AND RIDGING IN MID 
LEVELS OVER FCST AREA SHOULD LIMIT ANY INFLUENCE BROUGHT IN FROM THE 
EAST.

HAVE ISSUED DENSE FOG ADVISORY THIS MORNING ACROSS SW TWO-THIRDS OF 
FA.  SKIES HAVE CLEARED AND WITH ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE DENSE 
FOG HAS FORMED IN MANY LOCATIONS.  CLOUDS ACROSS THE NORTH AR 
INHIBITING THE WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG IN THE NORTH...BUT WILL KEEP AN 
EYE ON THINGS IN CASE WE HAVE TO EXPAND IT NORTH.

MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH 48 HOURS.  WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE PUSHED EAST TODAY...THEN A WARM FRONT WILL LIFT 
ACROSS THE FA TONIGHT.  LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE EARLY...THEN WILL BE 
RISING LATE.  HAVE INCREASED THE PCPN CHANCES TONIGHT TO 40 IN THE 
WEST AND 30 EAST.

PRESSURE GRADIENT INCREASES DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY.  ETA HAS 850 
JET OF 69 KTS OVER THE FA AT 18Z TUE.  HAVE GONE WINDY IN THE 
NORTHWEST...AND KEPT TH BREEZY ELSEWHERE ON TUESDAY.  CURRENT 
FORECAST HAD 100 POPS TUE AND TUE NGT AND CURRENT GUIDANCE SUPPORTS 
THIS...SO NO CHANGE THERE.

ETA IS QUICKER IN PUSHING PCPN OUT OF THE FA...AS ITS 500MB GOES A 
LITTLE NEGATIVE TILT AS IT PASSES THE FA.  AVN IS SLOWER AND MORE 
POSITIVELY TILTED.  NEW UKMET IS IN BETWEEN THE TWO.  CONSISTENCY

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO FA.  
THIS HAS BROUGHT SOME DIVERGENT FLOW INTO THE REGION WHICH HAS BEGUN 
TO BREAK UP THE CLOUDS OVER SRN INDIANA/NRN KENTUCKY/SW OHIO.  WHERE 
SKIES HAVE BROKEN FOG HAS BEGUN TO DEVELOP.  EXPECT BREAK TO 
CONTINUE TO FILTER INTO FA OVERNIGHT WITH THE ETA SHOWING DRIER AIR 
TRYING TO PUSH INTO FA.  ALSO 925 FLOW IS DIVERGENT FOR MUCH OF THE 
NIGHT WHICH WILL AID IN THE BREAK UP.  WHERE BREAKS DO OCCUR PATCHY 
DENSE FOG WILL DEVELOP.  IF BREAKS BECOME NUMEROUS OR BIG ENOUGH 
THEN A DENSE FOG ADVISORY WILL BE AN OPTION. 

HAVE ALREADY UPDATED ZONES TO ADD PATCHY DENSE FOG TO MOST ZONE

LATEST GFS RUN INDICATES NEXT THREAT OF PRECIPITATION TO BEGIN LATE

THUNDER TO ALL ZONES WITH MODELS SHOWING MARGINAL INSTABILITY ACROSS

QUICKLY ADVECT INTO FCST AREA TONIGHT AS STRONG WAA AND ISENT LIFT 
DVLP ACRS REGION WITH 850 JET INCREASING AFTER 06Z.  THIS SHOULD 
ALLOW SCT SHRA TO DVLP LATE TONIGHT ACRS WESTERN FCST 
AREA...SPREADING NORTH AND EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT.  BEST ISENT LIFT 
WILL BE ACRS NORTHERN 2/3 FCST AREA...AND WILL RAISE TO AROUND 50 
POPS GENERALLY NORTH OF A CVG-ILN-CHILLICOTHE LINE.  ACRS NORTHERN 
KY AND SO CNTRL OH WILL KEEP 30 POPS.  

WILL SEE A BREAK IN PCPN DURING DAY TUES AS BETTER LIFT AND LO LVL 
CONV MOVE EAST....BUT ABUNDANT LO LVL MOISTURE WILL KEEP THICK SC ACRS 
FCST AREA ALL DAY.  WITH WAA CONTINUING AND 850 TEMPS RISING THRU 
DAY...COULD EVEN SEE SOME DRIZZLE.  HAVE LEFT 30 POPS FOR TUES.  
WEATHER BEGINS TO GET MORE INTERESTING TUES NIGHT AS WARM FRNT 
TRACKS INTO OH VALLEY AHEAD OF DVLPG LO TO OUR NORTH AND WEST.  12Z 
ETA/GFS HAVE COME BETTER INTO LINE FOCUSING SWATH OF PCPN ACRS FCST 
AREA ON NOSE OF 50 KT 850 JET OVERNIGHT TUES INTO ERLY WED.  HAVE 
LKLY POPS FOR ENTIRE FCST AREA TUES NIGHT.

SOME DIFFERENCES STILL REMAIN IN TIMING OF FROPA FOR WED BTWN 
MODELS.  ETA CONTINUES TO BE MOST PROGRESSIVE (BUT SLOWER THAN PREV 
RUN)..BLASTING FRNT THRU FCST AREA BY LATE WED AFTN DUE TO WEAKER 
SFC LO.  GFS/UKMET/ECMWF INDCG WED EVNG FROPA.  HAVE TRENDED MORE 
WITH SLOWER GFS SOLN AND EXTENDED POPS INTO WED EVNG BEFORE DROPPING 
THEM BACK.  BOTH ETA/GFS INDCG SOME WEAK INSTABILITY ON WED AND 
COMBINED WITH STRONG DYNAMICS...THINK A RUMBLE OF THUNDER IS 
POSSIBLE ON WED AFTN (ESPECIALLY ACRS SOUTHERN FCST AREA).  FOR 
NOW...WILL LET LATER SHIFTS DECIDE ON PLACING THUNDER IN FCST.  
INTENSE CAA DVLPG WED NIGHT AND EXPECT TEMPS TO PLUMMET.  WITH WRAP 
AROUND MOISTURE DROPPING INTO WEST CNTRL AND CNTRL OH...CRIT 
THICKNESSES CONTINUE TO SUPPORT POTENTIAL FOR SOME FLAKES TO MIX IN 
LATE WED NIGHT.  ALSO HAVE MAINTAINED BRISK WORDING IN ZONES FOR WED 
NIGHT AS 40 KT WINDS NOTED AT 925 MB.

TEMPS...GENERALLY REMAINED CLOSE TO PREV FCST TEMPS AND MAV GUID 
THRU TUES NIGHT.  NOT READY TO JUMP ON MUCH WARMER MAV TEMPS FOR WED 
WITH STRONG WAA PATTERN AHEAD OF COLD FRNT...BUT DID WARM TEMPS A 
FEW DEGREES FROM PREV FCST. 


.LONG TERM...
MODELS SEEM TO BE IN DECENT AGREEMENT FOR THE MAJOR FEATURES IN THE 
LONG TERM. AFTER PRECIP ENDS WED/WED NITE...DRY WX SHOULD PREVAIL 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE REST OF THE FORECAST. A MID LEVEL CLOSED LOW IS 
TAKING AIM AT OHVLY SAT NITE/SUN BUT REALLY SLAMMING INTO A FAIRLY 
DRY ATMOSPHERE ALREADY IN PLACE. THIS LOW WEAKENS AND MRF SUGGESTS 
THAT IT JUST DEGRADES INTO A S/W AS IT GOES OVER THE FCST AREA WHERE 
SFC HI PRESSURE REMAINS IN CONTROL. LITTLE QPF TO NOTE AS WELL. 
EXPECT TO JUST HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER OR CHANCE OF 
SPRINKLES EARLY SUN. REALLY EXPECT THE SPRINKLES ONLY BRIEFLY...BUT 
CANT NARROW DOWN TIMING TOO MUCH. WILL CONTINUE WITH A SLOWER 
PROGRESSION OF THE SYSTEM AND ONLY TRY TO MENTION THIS QPF EARLY ON 
SUN.

HI PRES MOVES EAST ON SUN AND THE NEXT H5 TROF COMBINES WITH SFC LOW 
PRESSURE AND A CDFNT FOR A DECENT SHOT OF PRECIP ON MON. DONT 
EXPECT THE PRECIP MAXIMA EXTENDING FROM LA THRU TN AND KY TO REACH 
MY FCST AREA LATE SUN AS THIS IS LIMITED TO ISENTROPIC LIFT IN THE 
WARM SECTOR. PAST SEVERAL SYSTEMS THAT HAVE HIT US LIKE THIS HAVE 
HAD LITTLE IN THE WAY OF WARM SECTOR SHOWERS AND ID LIKE TO LEAVE 
SUN NITE DRY...ESP WITH A SLOWER PROGRESSION THOUGHT PROCESS. WILL 
PUT IN 40-50 POPS MONDAY AND SEE HOW THE FRONT IS PLACED WITH FUTURE 
MODEL RUNS LATER THIS WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...
MODELS SEEM TO BE COMING INTO AGREEMENT THROUGH TONIGHT BUT 
AFTERWARDS THE ETA TRENDS MUCH FURTHER SOUTH. HAVE DECIDED TO FAVOR 
THE GFS WITH SOME HEDGING TOWARDS THE EVEN SLOWER UKMET SOLUTION.

FOR TODAY EXPECT TO SEE AN INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS AS WELL AS SOME 
LOW TO MID LEVEL CLOUDS AS MOISTURE INCREASES IN THE 850 TO 700 MB 
LAYER. WARM ADVECTION STRENGTHENS TONIGHT ESPECIALLY IN THE LATTER 
HALF OF THE NIGHT WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF SOME SHOWERS.

EXPECT THAT PRECIPITATION TO MOVE OFF TO THE EAST OF THE AREA DURING 
THE MORNING HOURS WITH SOMETHING OF A LULL FOR MUCH OF THE DAY 
ALTHOUGH WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES. THEN NEXT ROUND OF 
PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING WAVE 
OF LOW PRESSURE. THE GFS IS PROBABLY OVERDONE WITH THIS FEATURE BUT 
STILL EXPECT A SURFACE WAVE TO MOVE INTO THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. 
HAVE GONE WITH LIKELY POPS FOR ALL BUT THE SOUTHEAST ZONES. THUNDER 
IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. BUT ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY AT THIS POINT TO 
STICK WITH JUST SHOWERS.

PRECIPITATION WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE TRAILING COLD FRONT WHICH WILL 
WORK ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL BRING AN END 
TO THE SHOWERS. 

IN GENERAL HAVE BUMPED UP TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES AND TRIED TO 
NARROW DOWN THE DIURNAL RANGE DUE TO CLOUDS...WIND AND PRECIPITATION.

.DISCUSSION...
MODELS IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT OVERALL EXCEPT FOR THE ETA 
CONTINUING TO BE QUITE AGGRESSIVE IN BRINGING LOW AND MID LEVEL 
MOISTURE BACK ON MONDAY. PREFERRED THE GFS IN THIS ASPECT WHICH HAS 
SUPPORT FROM THE NGM. THIS WOULD SEE QUITE A BIT OF HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUD MOVE INTO THE REGION ON MONDAY BUT THE LOWER LEVELS WOULD NOT 
MOISTEN UP UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE OFF TO THE EAST TODAY. SOME MID AND HIGH 
CLOUDS ARE CURRENTLY SKIRTING THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE AREA BUT 
MODEL PROFILES ARE SHOWING A RATHER DRY COLUMN THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
KEEPING IT MOSTLY SUNNY. APPEARS THAT IT SHOULD BE A GOOD 
RADIATIONAL COOLING NIGHT AND HAVE GONE WITH COOLER GUIDANCE. WARM 
FRONT WILL LIFT NORTH OF THE AREA ON MONDAY. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN 
HIGHS JUMPING ABOUT 10 DEGREES WARMER THAN TODAY. THICKNESS 
FORECASTS SUGGEST THAT TEMPERATURES COULD BE EVEN A COUPLE OF 
DEGREES HIGHER. BUT HAVE DOUBTS THAT READINGS WILL BE ABLE TO REACH 
THAT POTENTIAL SINCE WARM AIR ADVECTION WILL TAKE A WHILE TO DEVELOP.

EXPECT TO SEE SOME SHOWERS DEVELOP IN THIS PATTERN MONDAY NIGHT AS 
LOW LEVEL FLOW STRENGTHENS AND MOISTURE RETURNS BUT HAVE STUCK WITH 
JUST LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES. HAVE GONE WITH THE WARM ETA MOS 
GUIDANCE AND WOULD THINK THAT THESE LOWS WILL BE IN THE EARLY PART 
OF THE NIGHT.

EXPECT TO SEE A CONTINUED CHANCE OF SHOWERS INTO TUESDAY WITH THAT 
CHANCE INCREASING LATER IN THE DAY AND ESPECIALLY BY TUESDAY NIGHT 
AS A WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE REGION. TRAILING COLD FRONT 
WILL THEN MOVE THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY.

FIRST ORDER OF BUSINESS IS TO LET FREEZE WARNING RUN UNTIL 
EXPIRATION LATER THIS MORNING. SHOULD BE ABLE TO CLEAR ALL COUNTIES 
FROM THE FROST/FREEZE PROGRAM FOR THIS SEASON.

MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT BUT THEN DIVERGE 
SOMEWHAT ON MONDAY. EXPECT MAINLY CLEAR SKIES THIS MORNING BUT THEN 
MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS SHOULD COME STREAMING BACK INTO THE REGION 
LATER TODAY IN ASSOCIATION WITH ANOTHER FAST MOVING SHORT WAVE. AT 
THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT THESE CLOUDS SHOULD MAINLY AFFECT SOUTHERN 
ZONES THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING WHICH COULD HAMPER VIEWING OF 
THE LUNAR ECLIPSE. EXPECT TO CLEAR OUT AGAIN TONIGHT WITH THE NEXT 
BATCH OF MID LEVEL CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS ON SUNDAY NIGHT. COOL AND 
DRY HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE IN THE LOW LEVELS. DID NOT 
MAKE MUCH CHANGE IN FORECAST TEMPERATURES THROUGH SUNDAY BUT DID 
STICK CLOSER TO GUIDANCE FOR SUNDAY NIGHT.

ETA MAINTAINS A MORE DEFINED WARM FRONT WHICH LIFTS ACROSS THE 
REGION ON MONDAY. THERE IS A SURGE OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WITH THIS 
FEATURE WHICH LOOKS A LITTLE OVERDONE. MEANWHILE THE GFS WEAKENS THE 
WARM FRONT AND JUST BACKS THE WINDS TO THE SOUTH AND IS MUCH SLOWER 
TO INCREASE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. ALSO THE ETA HAS A STRONGER SHORT 
WAVE MOVING INTO THE GREAT LAKES BY MONDAY NIGHT WHICH RESULTS IN 
PRECIPITATION DEVELOPING FURTHER SOUTH. HAVE KEPT MONDAY DRY AND 
MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO MONDAY NIGHT WHICH BRINGS GRIDS CLOSER IN 
LINE WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES.

CLEARING LINE IS QUICKLY MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION EXPECT LOW LEVELS TO REMAIN 
VERY DRY. SO WILL ONLY BE DEALING WITH MID AND UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE 
OCCASIONALLY AFFECTING THE AREA AS VARIOUS DISTURBANCES MOVE THROUGH 
THE FAST ZONAL FLOW. LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE SOME EXTENSIVE MID 
CLOUDS MOVING IN DURING THE DAY SATURDAY AND THEN CLEARING DURING 
THE EVENING.

MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM 
OTHER THAN THE GFS OVERDEVELOPING SHORT WAVES. ALSO THE GFS 
CONTINUES TO HAVE A COLD BIAS WITH DAYTIME TEMPERATURES. THE ETA MOS 
IS STILL TOO WARM BUT THE ETA 2 METER TEMPERATURES LOOK MORE 
REASONABLE AND FOLLOW ALONG FAIRLY CLOSE THE NGM MOS NUMBERS. 
GUIDANCE IS WELL CLUSTERED FOR LOWS TONIGHT AND HAVE NOT VARIED TOO 
MUCH. HAVE NOT YET CLEARED THE COUNTIES IN THE CINCINNATI TRI-STATE 
AREA FROM THE FROST/FREEZE PROGRAM. SO WILL ISSUE WHAT SHOULD BE THE 
LAST FREEZE WARNING OF THE SEASON FOR THAT PART OF THE AREA. 
TEMPERATURES COULD BE A LITTLE TRICKIER ON SATURDAY NIGHT GIVEN THE 
POSITION OF THE HIGH WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO DECOUPLING IN THE NORTH 
BUT A CHANCE THAT THERE MAY STILL BE SOME LIGHT WIND IN THE SOUTH. 
HAVE FAVORED COOLER NUMBERS WITH READINGS AT OR SLIGHTLY BELOW THOSE 
EXPECTED TONIGHT.

LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO RETURN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH 
ON SUNDAY NIGHT. MODELS SHOW WARM FRONT LIFTING ACROSS THE REGION ON

IT WILL BE A TRICKY FCST FOR THE FIRST 12 HRS.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY 
SHOWS A PLUME OF SUBTROPICAL MSTR FRM TX...EXTENDING NE INTO THE 
GREAT LAKES REGION.  FIRST PROBLEM OF THE DAY WILL BE THE PCPN ACRS 
IL/IN.  THE PCPN SEEMS TO BE ISENTROPICALLY DRIVEN BETWEEN 800 MB TO 
700 MB (OR 300 K TO 305 K).  THE ETA MODEL SEEMS TO HAVE CAPTURED 
THIS AREA...MOVING IT NE INTO THE WAPAKONETA AND DAYTON REGIONS BY 
MORNING...THEN ACRS CNTRL OHIO DURING THE MORNING HOURS.  BIG 
PROBLEM EXITS FOR THE SOUTH AS THE ETA MODEL SHOWS A SPLIT IN THE 
PCPN FIELDS OF AFOREMENTIONED AREA AND MORE ORGANIZED PCPN FCST TO 
DEVELOP ALONG AND NORTH OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE TN VLY.  GFS 
SEEMS TO BE OVERDONE WITH ITS UPR 250 MB DIV BULLSEYE OVER THE CNTRL 
OHIO VLY REGION...WHERE AS THE ETA SHOWS A MUCH WEAKER VALUE.  
THUS...THE GFS DEVELOPS A HUGH QPF BULLSEYE OVER SE OHIO...NRN KY 
AND NW WV.  DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE POSSIBLE SPLIT AND TRYING 
TO COLLABORATE WITH SURROUNDING SRN AND ERN OFFICES...HAVE OPTED FOR 
THE 50 POP FOR TODAY.  WITH MOST LOCATIONS STAYING OVERCAST 
TODAY...SHOULD ONLY SEE ABOUT A FIVE DEGREE RISE IN TEMPS FROM 
MINIMUMS THIS AM.

FOR TONIGHT...DRIER AIR BEGINS TO GRADUALLY BUILD THROUGH THE CWFA 
(NW TO SE) AS LOW LVL ANTICYCLONIC DEVELOPS.  TEMPS WILL RANGE FROM 
THE UPPER 20S NW TO THE LOWER AND MID 30S S AND SE.

ON FRIDAY...SKIES SHOULD BE PARTLY CLOUDY AS HIGH LVL MOISTURE 
RIPPLES ACRS THE OHIO VLY REGION.  TEMPS WILL BE COOL.

OUR FAR SWRN CWFA STILL HAS YET TO BE CLEARED OF FROST/FREEZE 
HEADLINES THIS FALL SEASON.  THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE:  HOW COLD 
WILL IT GET BY SATURDAY MORNING.  THIS IS DIFFICULT TO ANSWER ATTM 
AS THE UPR LVL FLOW REMAINS ZONAL... AND...AS USUALLY IS THE CASE 
WITH ZONAL FLOW...IT CONTAINS HIGH RH VALUES IN THE MID AND HIGH 
LVLS.   THIS DIRTY FLOW PATTERN AND THE CLOUDS IT COULD PRODUCE 
WOULD MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE OVERNIGHT LOWS FOR SATURDAY.
(AT LEAST 5 DEGREES). BELIEVE IT WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY ATTM...AND AS 
A RESULT...I HAVE RAISED SATURDAY MORNINGS LOWS BY ABOUT 5 DEGREES.  
BEST CHC FOR COLDEST TEMPS MAY ACTUALLY HAPPEN SUNDAY MORNING.  DAY 
SHIFT SHOULD HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON THIS.

ETA/GFS FAIRLY SIMILAR WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE.  ETA...HOWEVER...SHOWS

GOOD AT THIS TIME.  WITH CONVECTIVE NATURE OF THE PCPN...WILL 
MENTION THE POSSIBLY OF A THUNDERSTORM.  TEMPS A LITTLE TRICKY GIVEN 
THAT THE OFFICIAL HIGH BEGINS AT 12Z (7 AM EST).  AS A

COLD FRONT CURRENTLY IN ILLINOIS WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION 
WITH IT. LATEST SHORT TERM GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE FRONT WILL NOT 
MAKE IT INTO THE NORTHWEST PART OF THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL CLOSE TO 
12Z. THIS LOOKS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN EARLIER THOUGHT AND THIS WILL 
RESULT IN WARMER LOW TEMPERATURES IN THAT REGION. ELSEWHERE LOWS 
LOOK FAIRLY REASONABLE WITH HIGH DEW POINTS AND SOME WIND KEEPING 
TEMPERATURES MILD OVERNIGHT. 

SO FAR CLOUDS HAVE MAINLY BEEN IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS STREAMING 
IN FROM THE WEST. LOWER CLOUDS TO THE SOUTH DISSIPATED WITH LOSS OF 
HEATING. ALTHOUGH STILL EXPECT TO SEE STRATOCUMULUS REDEVELOP LATER 
TONIGHT ALONG WITH A FEW SHOWERS. HOWEVER PLAN ON BACKING OFF 
SLIGHTLY ON THE RAIN CHANCE OVERNIGHT IN EASTERN ZONES. IN THE WEST 
WILL STICK WITH A HIGH CHANCE AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE 
FRONT APPROACH BUT WILL TIME IT IN AS LATE.

ETA/GFS FAIRLY SIMILAR WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE.  ETA...HOWEVER...SHOWS

DAY...CVG AND CMH SHOULD COME CLOSE TO EITHER EQUALING OR EXCEEDING

HAVE JUST MENTIONED THUNDER FOR THE DAYTIME PERIOD ON WEDNESDAY AND 
INTO THE EARLY EVENING. BELIEVE THAT THE OVERNIGHT CHANCES ARE A BIT 
LOWER THAN FCST ON TUES NIGHT AS WARM SECTOR SHOWERS SHOULD BE LIGHT

APPEARS THAT THE FRONT HAS JUST ABOUT STALLED OUT ACROSS SOUTHERN 
OHIO AT THIS TIME. THIS BOUNDARY WILL LIFT BACK NORTH OVERNIGHT 
ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS QUICK AS 12Z ETA AND GFS ARE SUGGESTING. 

MAIN QUESTION IS WHAT THE CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY 
MORNING. LATEST MODEL RUN HAS TRENDED WETTER MAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN 
ZONES WITH MOS POPS HIGHER AND IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT FOR THE 
ENTIRE REGION. PRECIPITATION HAS MOVED OUT OF THE AREA FOR NOW. 
ADDITIONAL SHOWERS ARE MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS ILLINOIS. FORCING 
LOOKS QUITE WEAK BUT VERY HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER IS POOLED ALONG 
AND TO THE SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY. AS THIS LIFTS NORTH EXPECT THERE 
TO BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ESPECIALLY IN THE DEEPER MOISTURE. WOULD 
NOT BE SURPRISED IF PRECIPITATION MOVING OUT OF THE MID MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY EVENTUALLY STARTS FILLING IN TO THE EAST LATER TONIGHT ALONG 
THIS AXIS OF HIGHER MOISTURE. WITH THAT IN MIND WILL HAVE LIKELY TO 
HIGH CHANCE PROBABILITIES IN NORTHERN ZONES TAPERING TO LOW CHANCE 
IN THE SOUTH.

WILL NEED TO CONTINUE CHANCE INTO THE MORNING FOR THE NORTHERN TIER. 
THEN AS FRONT MOVES FURTHER NORTH INTO THE GREAT LAKES THE CHANCE OF

SAT PIX AND SURFACE OBS INDICATING MAINLY CI ACROSS AREA THIS 
MORNING WITH LOWER SC JUST OFF TO OUR NW. COLD FRONT CURRENTLY UP 
ACROSS SOUTHERN WISCONSIN IS FORECAST TO SAG SLOWLY SOUTH INTO OUR 
AREA THROUGH THE NEXT 36 HOURS OR SO BEFORE LIFTING BACK OFF TO THE 
NORTH. SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS AND ETA WITH THE GFS PUSHING 
THE FRONT FARTHER SOUTH INTO AREA. WITH HIGH TO OUR SOUTH...PREFER 
FURTHER NORTH ETA SOLUTION AND WILL TREND FORECAST IN THAT 
DIRECTION. 

FOR TODAY...GOOD SOUTHWEST FLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS OUT AHEAD OF FRONT 
WITH DECENT ISENT LIFT SHOWN ON THE ETA 300K SURFACES. NOT A WHOLE 
LOT OF MOISTURE TO WORK WITH...PARTICULARLY IN THE LOW LEVELS. 
HOWEVER...PDEFS DO DROP OFF THROUGH THE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE 
NORTHWEST SO WILL INTRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE THERE AND THEN CONTINUE 
IT INTO TONIGHT. WILL LEAVE AREAS FURTHER TO THE SOUTH DRY FOR NOW 
BUT THINK THE POSSIBILITY MAY EXIST FOR A FEW SPRINKLES.

TEMPS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON AMOUNT OF 
CLOUD COVER AND EXACT POSITION OF FRONT. BASED ON CURRENT THINKING 
OF THE ETA...WILL DISCOUNT THE COOLER MAV FOR MOST OF OUR AREA AND 
LEAN TOWARD WARMER FWC/ETA TEMPS. COULD SEE A PRETTY SHARP GRADIENT

LLVL JET IS STICKING AROUND AND SHOULD HELP TO MINIMIZE TEMPERATURE 
FALLS IN NWRN FCST AREA TONIGHT. CURRENT FCST HAS MID TO UPPER 50S 
ACROSS THE WEST AND ID LEAN ON THE WARMER FOR THIS IN THE NORTHWEST 
QUARTER OF FCST AREA. LAST NIGHT DECOUPLED AND TEMPS WERE ABLE TO 
DROP A BIT MORE THAN EXPECTED...BUT AM A BIT MORE CONFIDENT THAT 
WINDS SHOULD AT LEAST HOLD OFF A QUICK DROP IN TEMPS NW OF THE I-71

ONE PROBLEM HERE IS THAT NEWARK AND AREAS EAST OF CMH DECOUPLED AND 
QUICKLY DROPPED TO 10 DEGREES FROM ANY SURROUNDING REPORTING

UNITED STATES. FAIRLY GOOD PRESSURE GRADIENT SHOULD REMAIN ACROSS 
THE AREA THROUGH TOMORROW AND THEN RELAX AS A COLD FRONT SAGS INTO

I-70 ON SATURDAY BEFORE LIFTING BACK TO THE NORTH IN THE EVENING. 
WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ON SATURDAY IN FAR 
NORTHERN ZONES AND PROBABLY CONTINUE A SLIGHT CHANCE INTO THE

THIS SOLN IS A SHIFT FROM PREV GFS AND OTHER LONG RANGE MODEL

AREA IS ABOUT TO COME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A MID LEVEL TROF THAT 
IS DIGGING INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY.  MOIST SOUTHWEST 
FLOW AHEAD OF THE TROF WILL BRING A SHOT OF PRECIP TO ILN TODAY.  
TROF AXIS IS PROGGED TO BE NEAR ILN AT 12Z WEDNESDAY...WITH ETA 
SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN GFS. BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...POST-TROF ENVIRONMENT 
WILL FEATURE A DRY WESTERLY FLOW.  FLOW WILL TURN SOUTHWEST AGAIN ON 
THURSDAY AHEAD OF A BROAD TROF THAT WILL DEVELOP OVER THE WESTERN 
CONUS.  

SURFACE MAP HAS WEAK RIDGE MOVING SOUTHEAST AWAY FROM ILN...WITH A 
LOW OVER MINNESOTA JUST AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW.  SOUTHERLY FLOW/WARM 
ADVECTION HAS ALREADY DEVELOPED WELL OUT AHEAD OF THE LOW.  THE LOW 
WILL DRAG A FRONT TOWARD THE AREA TODAY...THEN ACROSS THE AREA LATE 
TONIGHT.  WITH A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT 
...CATEGORICAL POPS AS PER MOS GUIDANCE ARE APPROPRIATE FOR TODAY 
EXCEPT IN OUR SOUTHEAST ZONES (GOING WITH LIKELY POPS) WHERE 
MOISTURE MAY TAIL OFF AS THE FRONT COMES IN.  SHOWERS WILL END EARLY 
TONIGHT AS MOST OF THE PRECIP IS AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  

WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVING IN...SKIES WILL CLEAR WEDNESDAY 
AFTER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SCOURS OUT IN THE MORNING.  DRY CONDITIONS 
WILL PERSIST THROUGH THURSDAY WITH THE HIGH MOVING TO THE EAST COAST 
AND A MILD SOUTHERLY DEVELOPING AHEAD OF ANOTHER LOW OVER THE 
PLAINS.  

TEMPS:  MAV GUIDANCE APPEARS A BIT COOL TODAY IN WARM ADVECTION.  
SEEMS STRANGE THAT GUIDANCE IS WARMER BEHIND THE FRONT ON 
WEDNESDAY...BUT THERE WILL BE MORE INSOLATION ON WEDNESDAY...AND THE 
WESTERLY FLOW WILL BRING MILDER PACIFIC AIR (FOR A CHANGE).  
THURSDAY WILL BE QUITE MILD WITH THE UPPER RIDGE TAKING SHAPE OVER 
THE EASTERN CONUS AND THE AFOREMENTIONED SOUTHERLY FLOW IN THE LOW 
LEVELS.

CU HAVE DISSIPATED AS UPPER TROUGH AXIS HAS PASSED E OF THE REGION. 
DRIER AIR HAS WORKED INTO THE OH VALLEY IN BRIEF AREA OF SUBSIDENCE 
AHEAD OF NEXT APPROACHING SW/V AND THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM NOW OVER 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS. CLOUD COVER SHOULD DECREASE DURING THE EVENING 
WITH CU MIXING OUT BEFORE MID AND HIGH CLOUDS WORK IN LATE TONIGHT. 
SO WENT WITH INCREASING CLOUDS MOST AREAS...WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES 
IN THE E.

ATMOSPHERE WILL HAVE TO MOISTEN UP FROM THE TOP DOWN TO A LARGE 
EXTENT TOMORROW BEFORE ONSET OF PRECIP. SOME MOISTURE SHOULD ALSO 
ADVECT NORTH AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM AS WINDS BECOME MORE SOUTHERLY 
OVERNIGHT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT BRINGING ONSET OF PRECIP 
DURING THE LATE MORNING HRS OVER THE WESTERN ZONES...WITH PRECIP 
GENERALLY HOLDING OFF UNTIL THE AFTERNOON OVER THE EASTERN AREAS.
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE GENERALLY IN THE CAT RANGE AND UPPED POPS A BIT 
WITH THIS TREND FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST. WENT WITH HIGHER POPS 
GENERALLY N OF THE OH RIVER CLOSER TO THE VORT TRACK...WITH LOWEST 
POPS IN N KY SOUTH OF THE CVG AREA. TEMPS SHOULD CLIMB INTO THE 
LOWER 60S IN THE EASTERN ZONES BEFORE THE THICKER CLOUDS MOVE IN 
WITH LESS OF A TEMP RISE IN THE WEST COMBINED WITH WAA.

DRY SLOT WORKS IN ON TUE NIGHT FIRST IN THE WESTERN ZONES WITH 
CLOUDS LINGERING A BIT LONGER IN THE EAST ALONG WITH GOOD PRECIP 
CHANCES DURING THE EVENING THERE AS WELL. WED WILL BE DRY WITH WEAK 
HIGH PRESSURE UNDER CONTROL. WRAP AROUND MOISTURE FROM EASTERN GREAT 
LAKES SYSTEM SHOULD AFFECT AREAS WELL TO THE N. LOWERED TEMPS ON WED 
NIGHT...MAINLY IN THE EAST WITH SFC HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
APPALACHIANS.

ON THU WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EAST COAST AND AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES INTO THE ROCKIES WAA WILL 
BEGIN TO REALLY KICK IN AND PERIOD OF ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS WILL BEGIN 
AS UPPER RIDING BEGINS BUILDING OVER THE WESTERN PACIFIC AND 
SOUTHEASTERN US.

ARCTIC BOUNDARY SHOULD LINGER N OF THE AREA UNTIL SAT...BEFORE 
FINALLY TRYING TO PUSH SOUTH. HOWEVER...STRONG RIDGING OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN US WILL SLOW ITS PROGRESS. THE FRONT SHOULD DROP DOWN 
INTO THE CWA ON SUN...AND PERHAPS CROSS THE CWA LATE SUN NIGHT OR 
MON. THIS WOULD LEAD TO ABOUT A 10 DEGREE N TO S TEMP RANGE FROM 
SUN ON. CONTINUED SLOW CHANCE POPS WITH THIS SYSTEM. AS SWV/S MOVING 
AROUND THE RIDGE MAY HELP GENERATE SOME PRECIP ALONG THE BOUNDARY. 
TEMPS WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL FRI INTO SUN BEFORE FROPA.

FRONT MOVES SE OF THE FCST AREA. ANOTHER WAVE IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
ALONG THE SLOW MOVING FRONT TONIGHT.  IT MAY BE A CLOSE CALL IN THE 
SE...BUT WILL KEEP FCST DRY EVEN THERE TONIGHT AT THIS POINT.

FOR MONDAY...THE ETA AND GFS SHOW SOME WEAK INSTABILITY AS THE UPPER 
TROF PASSES ACROSS THE AREA.  WILL CONTINUE A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS...MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON....WHICH WILL BE ENDING BY EVENING.

ON TUESDAY...THE ETA AND GFS SHOW LL CONVERGENCE AND GOOD ISENTROPIC 
LIFT ON SIGNIFICANT SFC(S) AUGMENTED WITH LOW SAT PR DEFS AS A WARM 
FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION.  THE BEST LIFT WILL BE IN THE NORTH.  
HAVE DECIDED ON LIKELY POPS EXCEPT IN THE SE.  THE SHOWERS WILL 
LINGER INTO THE EVENING AT LEAST.

.LONG TERM...
PATTERN CHANGE COMING FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK. AFTER A SHORT 
WAVE QUICKLY MOVES OFF TO THE EAST EARLY WEDNESDAY AN UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD ALONG THE EAST COAST. 

THIS WILL BRING ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES. ENSEMBLE DATA SHOWS A 
LARGE SPREAD WITH THE OPERATIONAL GFS BEING ON THE WARM END OF THE 
ENVELOPE. BUT WITH THE EUROPEAN AND THE CANADIAN SUPPORTING THE 
OVERALL PATTERN HAVE TRENDED WARMER THROUGHOUT THE LONGER TERM. AND 
THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL FOR EVEN HIGHER TEMPERATURES BASED ON LOW 
LEVEL THICKNESS FORECASTS.

COULD SEE A FEW SHOWERS ALONG A WARM FRONT LIFTING ACROSS THE AREA 
ON WEDNESDAY. OTHERWISE IT SHOULD BE DRY THROUGH THE END OF THE 
WEEK. NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS APPEARS TO BE ON SUNDAY WITH A COLD

WAS DEVELOPING SW OF KCVG NEAR KSDF.  THE MODELS HAVE COME INTO 
DECENT AGREEMENT ON FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVEMENT.   AS THE NIGHT 
PROGRESSES...THE FRONT WILL SAG SLOWLY SE AND THE PCPN WILL SPREAD 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE FCST AREA.  BOTH THE GFS AND ETA SHOW SOME LL 
CONVERGENCE BEHIND THE FRONT.  ETA FCST SNDGS SHOW SOME ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY AND FAIRLY LOW LI(S) LINGERING INTO THE EVENING...SO 
WILL CARRY A CHANCE OF THUNDER UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

THE SHOWERS WILL LINGER INTO SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...AS A WAVE 
MOVES ALONG THE STALLED FRONT.  THERE WILL BE GOOD THICKNESS 
ADVECTION INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...AND TEMPS WILL REACH THE MID 30S 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA.  HOWEVER...GUIDANCE P-TYPE 
METHODS...ADVANCED P-TYPE METHODS...AND CRITICAL THICKNESSES ARE 
NOT FAVORABLE FOR SN.

WILL CONTINUE SHOWERS MONDAY...AS THE UPPER TROF MOVES ACROSS THE 
REGION.  THE SHOWERS WILL PUSH OFF TO THE EAST IN THE EVENING...BUT 
ANOTHER DISTURBANCE MAY BRING MORE PCPN TO THE WEST LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT.  WILL KEEP ALL PCPN LIQUID AT THIS POINT...BUT MAY BE A CLOSE 
CALL IN THE NORTH.

NEXT SYSTEM WILL QUICKLY SPREAD PRECIPITATION BACK INTO WESTERN 
SECTIONS LATE MONDAY NIGHT. APPEARS THAT LOW WILL PASS TO THE NORTH 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES BUT SHOULD HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AS 
OCCLUDED FRONT SWINGS ACROSS THE REGION. MAY GET SOME ADDITIONAL 
SHOWERS IN WRAP AROUND TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AFTER WHICH IT 
SHOULD DRY OUT.

EXPECT A WARMING TREND IN THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK. AND BASED ON 
LATEST MODEL RUNS WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF NEXT SATURDAY ENDS UP AS 
WARM AS TODAY. BUT OBVIOUSLY SOME UNCERTAINTY THAT FAR OUT AND 
PLENTY OF CHANGE COULD OCCUR BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. SO WILL ONLY GO A

HIGH PRESSURE PROVIDING CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE FA THIS AFTERNOON. 
EXPECT CLEAR SKIES TO CONTINUE INTO THIS EVENING BEFORE WE BEGIN TO 
SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS FROM THE NORTHWEST AHEAD OF APPROACHING

ACTUALLY SEE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE FAR SE FOR A GOOD PART OF

GRADUALLY OVERSPREAD FA WITH PCPN THROUGH THE DAY ON SATURDAY BUT 
WITH SLOWER SOLUTION...HAVE PUSHED BACK TIMING A FEW HOURS AND 
TRIMMED BACK POPS A LITTLE ACROSS THE FAR SE.

SURFACE HIGH FORECAST TO SLIDE EAST ACROSS AREA OVERNIGHT AND SHOULD 
BE CENTERED JUST TO OUR SE BY 12Z FRIDAY MORNING. 8H FLOW REMAINS

MAY HELP SOME CLOUDS LINGER ACROSS PARTS OF THE NORTHEAST BUT FOR

LOW LEVEL FLOW BACKS AROUND TO THE SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE DAY ON FRI

FAIRLY DECENT SC FIELD IN PLACE ACROSS FA THIS AFTERNOON IN  
NORTHWEST FLOW AND CAA PATTERN ALOFT WITH MORE LAKE ENHANCED TYPE 
CLOUDS FURTHER TO THE WEST ACROSS PARTS OF CENTRAL/NORTHERN INDIANA. 
EXPECT SOUTHWEST EDGE OF THESE CLOUDS TO DISSIPATE SOME THIS EVENING 
SINCE THEY APPEAR TO BE THE MOST DIURNAL. THIS COULD ALLOW FOR A 
BRIEF SCT TO CLR PERIOD ACROSS PARTS OF OUR SOUTHWEST LATER THIS 
EVENING. HOWEVER...MODELS SHOWING AN INCREASE IN 7H MOISTURE AS WE 
HEAD THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT WITH A LITTLE BIT OF ISENTROPIC LIFT/LOW 
PDEFS AT THE 295K LEVEL WORKING INTO WESTERN PORTIONS OF FA LATE 
TONIGHT. THIS COMBINES WITH SHEARING OUT VORT MAX FORECAST TO DROP 
DOWN FROM THE NORTHWEST TO CREATE SOME WEAK LIFT ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
AREA LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY. ETA CONTINUES TO BE 
CONSIDERABLY DRIER THAN GFS WITH ALL OF THIS AND IF IT ENDS UP BEING 
RIGHT...WILL ONLY END UP WITH A FEW SPRINKLES AT BEST. WITH THIS IN 
MIND...CURRENT THINKING IS TO HANG ON TO JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
PRETTY MUCH WHERE WE ALREADY HAVE THEM (BUT EXTEND THEM A LITTLE 
FURTHER TO THE SOUTHWEST IN GRIDS BASED ON ISENT LIFT).

LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS BOTH POINTING AT A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF A FEW SNOW FLAKES MIXING IN WITH ANY PCPN LATE 
TONIGHT SO WILL GO AHEAD AND MENTION THE POSSIBILITY ACROSS THE 
NORTHEAST WHERE TEMPS A LITTLE COOLER AND CHANCE FOR ANY PCPN A 
LITTLE BETTER. WILL KEEP PCPN ALL LIQUID ELSEWHERE. OTHER MINOR 
CONCERN FOR TONIGHT IS FROST DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHWEST 
WHERE WINDS SHOULD DECOUPLE FIRST AND BEST CHANCE FOR SEEING SOME 
CLEARING EXISTS. FOR NOW WILL BANK ON MID CLOUDS MOVING IN LATE TO 
DISRUPT THE RADIATIVE COOLING/FROST FORMATION...BUT EVENING SHIFT 
MAY HAVE TO REEVALUATE THINGS BASED ON SATELLITE TRENDS.

MODELS HANG ON TO FAIR AMOUNT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE THROUGH THE DAY 
WITH A BIT OF A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR AT 8H. WILL CONTINUE 
WITH A GENERAL MOSTLY CLOUDY FORECAST FOR THURSDAY AND HANG ON TO A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS...MAINLY IN THE MORNING ACROSS THE EAST. 
LOW LEVEL FLOW THEN BACKS AHEAD OF NEXT SYSTEM ON THURSDAY NIGHT 
WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FOR CLOUDS TO ERODE AWAY FROM WEST TO EAST LATE 
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY EVENING. WITH LIGHT WINDS...SHOULD SEE GOOD 
RADIATIVE COOLING AND WILL LIKELY GET SOME FROST IF NOT FREEZING 
TEMPS.  

WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW...GOOD WAA SETS UP FOR FRIDAY AHEAD OF

COLD FRONT HAS MOVED SE OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT TEMPS ARE 
IN THE MID 60S DESPITE THE TRAILING MID AND HIGH CLOUDS.

FOR TONIGHT...CLOUD COVER MAY BE A BIT VARIABLE IN THE EVENING...BUT 
SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA WITH THE NW 
FLOW AFTER THAT.  GUIDANCE LOW TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE.

WEDNESDAY LOOKS TO BE RATHER CLOUDY WITH TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 50S 
NORTH TO SOUTH.  500 MB VORT AXIS MOVES THROUGH AREA LATE AFTERNOON 
INTO THE NIGHT.  THE GFS PRODUCES SOME LIGHT PCPN WITH THIS AND HAS 
HIGH CHANCE POPS IN CORRELATION.  HOWEVER...THE ETA KEEPS ANY PCPN 
BANDS TO THE NE AND WEST OF THE FCST AREA AND SNDG PROFILES SHOW 
MOISTURE LAYER IS NOT VERY THICK.  EVEN THE GFS SHOWS LITTLE 
ISENTROPIC LIFT ON SIGNIFICANT SFC(S) THROUGH THIS PERIOD WHERE 
THERE ARE LOW SAT PR DEFS.  ALTHOUGH A SPRINKLE OR A FEW LIGHT 
SHOWERS CANNOT ABSOLUTELY BE RULED OUT...WILL KEEP WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT DRY AT THIS POINT.  P-TYPE METHODS AT CMH AND AOH 
ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR FLURRIES FROM THE RAW ETA OR THE MAV. 

FOR THURSDAY...MET AND GFS GUIDANCE ARE SOMEWHAT FAR APART....WITH 
THE MAV POINTING AT UPPER 40S TO MID 5OS WHILE THE MET PUSHES MID 
50S TO LOW 60S.  SIGNIFICANTLY...DESPITE THE MET GUIDANCE...THE RAW 
ETA IS JUST A BIT WARMER THAN THE MAV GUIDANCE...WHICH LOOKS 
REASONABLE.  CLEARING SKIES WILL BRING MID AND PERHAPS SOME LOW 30S

TO COME IN LINE WITH THE ECMWF SINCE YESTERDAY...NOW BUILDING A MID

REACH ILN AT 00Z SATURDAY.  DURING THE WEEKEND...FLOW IS PROGGED TO 
TURN SOUTHWEST AND BEGIN TO TAP GULF MOISTURE EARLIER THAN PREVIOUS 
MODEL RUNS INDICATED.  

GFS IS INCONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS RUNS WITH RESPECT TO THE NEXT

CALIFORNIA.  00Z GFS HAS CUTOFF LOW OVER MISSOURI AT 12Z MONDAY.  
GFS HAS COME CLOSER TO THE PREFERRED EUROPEAN MODEL...BUT IT STILL 
APPEARS TOO AMPLIFIED CONSIDERING IT IS FORECASTING SNOW OVER

KEEP SATURDAY PRECIP FREE.  UPPER TROF IS THEN PROGGED TO AMPLIFY

.SHORT TERM...
AT 18Z...SFC LOW PRESSURE WAS LOCATED OVER THE WRN U. P. OF 
MICHIGAN.  A COLD FRONT TRAILED FROM THIS FRONT INTO THE MIDDLE MS 
VLY AND SRN PLAINS.

LOOKING AT SATELLITE IMAGERY/OBS...COLD FRONT IS REALLY STARVED FOR 
DEEP MOISTURE GIVEN MID LVL NWLY FLOW.  GFS IS STILL VERY MOIST AT 
850 MB TONIGHT ACRS THE REGION AS FRONT APCHS AND PASSES THROUGH 
BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z.  THE ETA IS QUITE PALTRY.  TO AVOID YO-YO FCST 
AT THIS POINT...WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHC IN THE FCST TONIGHT/TUESDAY 
MORNING WITH FROPA.  HOWEVER...IT MAY ONLY BE A FEW SPRINKLES OR 
NOTHING AT ALL.  EVENING SHIFT WILL HAVE ONE MORE ROUND SHOULD THEY 
DECIDE TO PULL OUT POPS ALL TOGETHER.

THE WARM TEMPS OF TODAY WILL BEGIN A DOWNWARD TREND INTO MID WEEK.  
DEVELOPING H5 TROF IN WAKE OF COLD FRONT OVER THE ERN UNITED STATES 
WILL KEEP THE REGION IN A MOSTLY CLOUDY AND COOLER WX PATTERN.  
TEMPS ON TUESDAY WILL BE TRICKY...GIVEN THAT MORNING LOWS WILL START 
ON THE WARM SIDE.  ETA IS STILL SLOWER WITH ITS CAA PATTERN THAN THE 
GFS.  FOR EXAMPLE...18Z 850 MB TEMP AT CVG ON THE ETA IS 11 C WHILE 
THE GFS IS ABOUT 6 C.  THATS A 5 C DIFFERENCE...WHICH IS HUGE.  
WITH CLOUD COVER PROBLEMATIC ON TUESDAY (ALL MODELS SHOWING 500 MB 
RH IN NWLY FLOW WHICH COULD EQUATE INTO MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS) 
AND IN COLLABORATE WITH SURROUNDING OFFICE...HAVE LEANED TOWARD THE 
MORE WARMER ETA SINCE IT SEEMS THAT THE GFS TRIES TO PUSH COLDER AIR 
IN MUCH FASTER THAN WHAT HAPPENS IN REALITY.  WE WILL SEE WHAT 
TOMORROW BRINGS.

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...DEVELOPING 850 MB COLD POOL OVER THE GREAT LAKES 
WILL GRADUALLY SEEP SOUTHWARD...BRINGING ITS STRATOCUMULUS DECK WITH 
IT.  KEPT TEMPS ON THE WARMER SIDE GIVEN CLOUD COVER.

FOR WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SVRL VORTICITY DISTURBANCES 
RIPPLE THROUGH THE NWLY FLOW.  WITH NOT MUCH TO FOCUS ON AT THE SFC 
AND IN THE LOW LVLS...HAVE OPTED FOR A SLIGHT CHC OF SHOWERS ALL 
LOCATIONS FROM MID AFTN INTO THE EVENING HOURS (GIVEN LOW LVL 
INSTABILITY).  AGAIN...TEMPS A BIG BUGABOO.  FOR INSTANCE...MAV 
GUIDANCE HAS A HIGH OF 55 FOR CVG ON WEDNESDAY WHILE THE FWC HAS A 
HIGH OF 64.  WITH NOT A HIGH CONFIDENCE IN KNOWING WHICH MODELS 850 
MB COLD POOL WILL BE RIGHT (THE MUCH COLDER GFS VS THE WARMER 
ETA)...HAVE OPTED FOR A BLEND BETWEEN THE TWO...SINCE EITHER EXTREME 
PROBABLY WONT HAPPEN.  THIS SOLUTION ALSO MATCHES WELL WITH 
SURROUNDING OFFICES. HICKMAN.

&&

.LONG TERM...
GFS...ECMWF AND CANADIAN MODELS ALL SHOW HIGH AMPLITUDE 500 MB TROF 
PERSISTING OVER NORTHEAST CONUS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  THEN THE 
TROF IS PROGGED TO LIFT NORTHEAST AND ALLOW A RIDGE TO BUILD INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY ON SATURDAY BEFORE ANOTHER TROF ADVANCES THROUGH THE 
GREAT LAKES ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS A SPLIT FLOW DEVELOPS.  

SURFACE MAP WILL FEATURE HIGH PRESSURE THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.  
GFS HAS SLOWED FRONT THAT IS PROGGED TO ARRIVE ON SUNDAY.  MOISTURE 
WITH THE FRONT IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE FROM 00Z GFS...THOUGH IF IT 
OCCURS IT MAY EVENTUALLY TAP SOME GULF MOISTURE IN SOUTHWEST MID 
LEVEL FLOW.    

TEMPERATURES WILL COOL ON THURSDAY BEHIND EXITING LOW PRESSURE AND 
COLD FRONT AS THE SYSTEM INTENSIFIES OVER THE CANADIAN MARITIMES.  
READINGS WILL REBOUND TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDANCE BY SATURDAY AS WARM 
ADVECTION KICKS IN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SURFACE HIGH. TEMPS 
SHOULD NOT PLUMMET TOO MUCH FOLLOWING THE FRONT NEXT MONDAY SINCE 
THE SPLIT FLOW WILL KEEP COLDER WEATHER OVER CANADA WITH THE 
NORTHERN BRANCH OF THE JET STREAM.  CONIGLIO

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATED HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EAST COAST WITH 
LOW PRESSURE OVER UPPER MS VLY.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATED CLEAR 
SKIES OVER FA.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING SURFACE LOW FROM 
THE UPPER MS VLY CROSS THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES.  ITS ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE ACROSS FA LATE TONIGHT INTO EARLY TUESDAY 
MORNING.  ATMOSPHERE IS VERY DRY...SO EXPECT FRONT TO BE CLOUDY WITH 
A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS.  THE COLD AIR WILL LAG SOME WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
POSSIBLE EARLY ON TUESDAY.  HOWEVER...COLD AIR ADVECTION AND LOW 
LEVEL CLOUDS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES A GOOD 10 TO 15 DEGREES COOLER 
THAN HIGHS TODAY.

MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE IN HANDLING NEXT SYSTEM WHICH IS DIVING 
SOUTHEAST IN STRONG MID LEVEL NORTHWESTERLY FLOW.  THE ETA IS THE 
STRONGEST WITH DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW.  THE GFS AND UKMET ARE MUCH 
LESS AMPLIFIED.  WILL TEND TOWARDS THE GFS/UKMET SOLUTIONS FOR NOW.

MAV TEMPS LOOK GOOD.  THE ONLY REAL CHANGE IS TO GO A BIT WARMER 
TODAY FOR CVG AND CMH.

A WARM FRONT PUSHES ACRS THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VLY REGION ON MONDAY.

UP VERIFYING THEN IT WILL PROBABLY END UP MOSTLY CLOUDY. ALSO 
TRIMMED TEMPS DOWN JUST A TAD FOR THURSDAY. 

SHOULD THEN SEE A GRADUAL WARMUP FOR DAYTIME HIGHS AS SURFACE HIGH

NEXT SYSTEM. GFS HAS TRENDED SLOWER WITH NEXT FRONT...NOW BRINGING 
IT INTO AREA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUN. AS A RESULT HAVE PUSHED BACK

MODELS ARE ALL IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINING WEAK COLD FRONT 
ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN 
OVERNIGHT.  HOWEVER, IN THE FAST NWLY FLOW THE SURFACE PATTER WILL 
RAPIDLY CHANGE.  THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT SURFACE FEATURE WILL COME WITH 
A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY MORNING.  THIS FRONT 
WILL NOT HAVE MUCH PRECIP WITH IT.  THE BEST LIFT AND MOISTURE WILL 
BE MAINLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES.  HOWEVER, WOULD LIKE TO 
LEAVE PRECIP IN SINCE THIS IS A SUBSTANTIAL FRONT.  WILL BACK OFF ON 
POPS TO 20 SOUTH AND 30 NORTH.  NEXT SHIFT MAY BE ABLE TO PULL IT 
OUT.  WRAP AROUND MOISTURE THAT WAS EVIDENT ON THE 12Z RUNS HAS 
MOVED TO THE NORTH AND EAST.  INSTEAD OF YANKING IT OUT OF THE WHOLE

INTO THE ERN GREAT LAKES TONIGHT.

WILL GO MORE WITH THE DRIER ETA WITH COLD FRONT FOR 
TONIGHT...KEEPING SKIES MOSTLY CLEAR...AS MSTR IS LIMITED.  
CURRENTLY HAVE PC FOR THE NRN ZONES...BUT WILL MAKE A LAST MINUTE 
DECISION ON THIS.  WITH SW FLOW AHEAD OF FRONT...STUCK CLOSE TO MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR LOWS.

TEMPS WILL BEGIN TO REBOUND ON SUNDAY AS 850 MB TEMPS START TO WARM 
UP.  RH  FIELDS ARE PRETTY SCANT...SO MOSTLY SUNNY SUNDAY AND 
MOSTLY CLEAR SUNDAY NIGHT LOOK GOOD.  WENT A LITTLE WARMER THAN MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS ON SUNDAY.

ON MONDAY...WARM FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION.

GENERALLY REMAIN TO OUR EAST BUT WITH CYCLONIC LOW LEVEL FLOW AND 8H

SURFACE HIGH FORECAST TO BUILD INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THEN PUSH EAST ACROSS AREA ON THURSDAY. DEPENDING ON EXACT LOCATION 
OF SURFACE HIGH AND HOW FAST CLOUDS CAN CLEAR OUT...WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
COULD END UP PRETTY COLD. WENT AHEAD AND LOWERED TEMPS DOWN INTO THE

SLIGHT UPWARD MOTION NOTED IN OMEGA FIELDS TODAY DUE TO CONVERGENT

ETA IS SUGGESTING THAT I COULD KEEP IT OUT OF THE SOUTH. PREVIOUS 
RUNS SUGGESTED I COULD KEEP IT OUT OF THE NORTH AND IM NOT SURE 
THAT ANY AREA CAN BE TOTALLY EXCLUDED ATTM. HAVE DECIDED THAT SWRN 
FCST AREA IS THE ONLY SPOT WITHOUT CHANCE SPRINKLES AT SOME POINT 
TODAY. 

THIS BOUNDARY SETS UP AS A WMFNT OVER SRN FCST AREA TONIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY AND A SFC WAVE (STRONGEST FROM GFS) RIDES WELL SOUTH OF FCST 
AREA WITH MOISTURE BEING WRUNG OUT ALONG THE FRONT ON FRIDAY. 
PREVIOUS FCST WAS A LITTLE OVERDONE, BUT IVE ONLY DROPPED A BIT IN

GRADIENT OF RAIN/NO RAIN WITH THE BEST CHANCE ALONG THE OHIO RIVER. 
AM SEEING THE POSSIBILITY OF MIDLEVEL CONVECTION BUT WILL LEAVE FOR 
FUTURE SHIFTS TO ADD ANY THUNDER WORDING TO FCST AS INDICIES ARENT 
SHOWING MUCH IF ANYTHING ATTM. 

INCREASED TEMPS IN THE SOUTH TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH THE WMFNTL

NOT TOO MANY PROBLEMS IN THE SHORT TERM WITH FCST. HAVE ADJUSTED 
TEMPS SLIGHTLY BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY...SLIGHTLY WARMER IN THE SOUTH 
DURING THE DAY THURSDAY TO COME IN LINE WITH SURROUNDING FOS.

CLOUD COVER MIGHT BE A LITTLE LESS TODAY OVER THE NORTH THAN FCST 
BUT PROXIMITY TO COLDER AIR SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME CU TO FORM. 
ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER MAY ENTER LATER THIS AFTERNOON AS MID LEVEL 
CLOUDS GET CAUGHT UP IN STRONG NW FLOW. 

NOT MUCH CHANGE IN WX FOR THE NEXT 2 DAYS AS A COOL AND SEASONABLE 
AIRMASS IS OVER FCST AREA. PROBLEMS ARISE ON THURS NIGHT/FRIDAY AS 
GFS BLOWS UP A SFC LOW AND THE ETA HAS A MORE DEFINED NORTHERN EDGE 
TO EXPECTED PRECIP. HAVE PUT IN CHANCE POPS FOR MOST OF CWA ACROSS 
THE BOARD HERE BUT THINK THAT ANYTHING HAPPENING ON THURS AFTERNOON 
WILL BE VERY LIGHT IF IT OCCURRS SINCE THE TRIGGER FOR IT IS JUST A 
WEAK VORT MAX CAUGHT UP IN THE ZONAL FLOW. 

HAVE TAKEN A BLEND OF MODELS WITH LESS OF A SFC WAVE THAN GFS 
SUGGESTS FOR FRIDAY BUT A LITTLE MORE EXTENSIVE ON PRECIP AREA THAN 
ETA. THERES ENOUGH CONVERGENCE AT H8 TO INCREASE CLOUD COVER AND 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR ENTIRE FCST AREA...MOST NOTABLY ALONG THE OHIO 
RIVER. 

IN EITHER CASE, AFTER CHANCE OF RAIN ON THURS NIGHT/FRIDAY...HIGH

CONVECTION DEVELOPING BEHIND THE MAIN AREA OF SHOWERS...CLOSER TO

NEXT SYSTEM HANDLED WELL WITH MODELS. DO NOT EXPECT A WIND ADVISORY 
TODAY THOUGH GUSTS TO 35 AND 40 MPH ARE POSSIBLE IN THE CAA BEHIND 
THE PASSAGE OF THE LOW THIS AFTERNOON. WILL NOT GET INTO NEXT 24 
HOURS TOO MUCH WITH 100 POPS OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED/CHANCE THUNDER. 
INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT NW FCST AREA WOULDNT SEE ANY TRW, BUT ITS A 
LITTLE TOO CLOSE TO CALL SO IVE LEFT IT IN. 

HAVE INCREASED LOWS TONIGHT BY A DEGREE OR TWO AND TOMORROW NIGHT 
SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST IN QUESTION WITH SKY AND LOW TEMPS. INITIALLY 
THOUGHT THAT THERE WOULDNT BE MUCH CLOUD COVER RELATING TO THE 850 
MOISTURE WED NIGHT AS THERES NOT ANY SPECIFIC COLD POOL TO KEEP LOW 
CLOUDS AROUND. HAVE SORT OF SPLIT THE DIFFREENCE AND INCREASED CLOUD 
COVER TO COME IN LINE WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. DROPPED LOW TEMPS IN 
THE SOUTH BY A FEW. HOWEVER THIS DOESNT CHANGE MUCH OVERALL AS NRN 
OFFICES STILL REMAINED COLD AND SRN OFFICES WERE ALREADY COOL WITH 
LESS CLOUD COVER. THINK THAT ITLL BE CLEAR AND COULD BE ABOUT A 
CATEGORY COOLER THAN FCST.

UPPER FLOW BECOMING SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF APPROACHING HIGH AMPLITUDE 
TROF.  MODELS AGREE IN BRINGING TROF AXIS TO CMH AT 00Z TUESDAY.  
SYSTEM WILL BRING PLENTY OF PVA AND DEEP MOISTURE AS THE TROF DIGS 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY.  

RIGHT NOW AT THE SURFACE WE HAVE HIGH PRESSURE THAT IS SCOOTING EAST 
AHEAD OF DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW OVER OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE.  MODEL 
SOLUTIONS ARE CLOSE WITH LOW POSITIONED OVER WESTERN OHIO AT 18Z 
TUESDAY AND STRENGTH WITHIN 2 MB (ETA 997 GFS 995).  GFS IS SLIGHTLY 
FARTHER NORTH WITH THE LOW THAN THE ETA...THOUGH NEITHER MODEL HAS 
SHOWN GREAT RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY.  AT THIS EARLY STAGE...MODELS 
SEEM TO BE UNDERESTIMATING PRECIP AND ARE A LITTLE BIT SLOWER THAN 
THE ACTUAL WEATHER OUT AHEAD OF THE DEVELOPING SYSTEM.  

WITH EVENT NO LESS CERTAIN...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS LATE TONIGHT AND 
CATEGORICAL POPS FOR TUESDAY...DWINDLING TO CHANCE AGAIN TUESDAY 
NIGHT.  DUE TO DYNAMIC SYSTEM...WILL KEEP MENTION OF THUNDER EVEN 
THOUGH SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK.

BREEZY CONDITIONS WITH GUSTS TO 35 MPH ARE EXPECTED TUESDAY AND 
TUESDAY NIGHT.  WILL NEED TO WATCH THE STRENGTH OF THE LOW AND 
MONITOR PRESSURE FALLS AS IT APPROACHES TO SEE IF WIND ADVISORY 
CRITERIA MAY BE REACHED. 

TEMPS:  MOS GUIDANCE HAS COME INTO AGREEMENT SINCE YESTERDAY AND IT 
APPEARS TO LEND CONFIDENCE TO OUR FORECAST HIGHS IN THE LOW/MID 60S 
ON TUESDAY.  COOLING TREND BEHIND THE LOW ON WEDNESDAY SEEMS 
REASONABLE SO IM LOWERING THE PREVIOUS FORECAST A BIT.

.LONG TERM...
WEAK FRNTL BNDRY DROPS THRU OH VALLEY ON THURS.  GFS MORE AGGRESSIVE 
IN DVLPG PCPN...BUT WITH LITTLE FORCING HAVE ELECTED TO KEEP FCST 
DRY AND JUST INDICATE INCREASE IN CLOUDS.  STRONGER WAVE TO DVLP 
ALONG BNDRY ACRS CNTRL PLAINS THURS NIGHT AND QUICKLY TRACK EAST 
INTO LOWER OH VALLEY FRI.  GFS DVLPG MORE AMPLIFIED UPR TROF WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...RESULTING IN STRONGER/SLOWER SOLN THAN UKMET...ECMWF 
AND CANADIAN.  TRENDING AWAY FROM GFS A BIT AND GOING WEAKER WITH 
S/WV.  WITH INCONSISTENT SFC WAVE TRACK OVER LAST FEW MODEL 
RUNS...HAVE INCREASED TO 30 POPS ACRS ENTIRE FCST AREA FOR 
FRI...ENDING FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE EVNG. 

DRIER WX FOR WEEKEND AND INTO ERLY NEXT WEEK AS MUCH OF EASTERN 
CONUS REMAINS INFLUENCED BY BROAD UPR TROF.  WEAK S/WV DROPPING THRU 
TROF SUN LIKELY TO BRING BRIEF INCREASE IN CLOUDS.  850 TEMPS AND LO 
LVL THICKNESSES COOLER FRI THRU MON THAN PREV RUNS WITH COOL NW 
FLO.  AS A RESULT...LOWERED TEMPS ALL PERIODS FRI THRU SUN WITH 50S 
FOR HIGHS AND LOWS IN THE M/U30S TO AROUND 40.  WARMING TREND WILL

LOOKS TOO COOLE..WILL LEAN TOWARDS WARMER NGM MOS TODAY.
 
SHORTWAVE...THEN DIVES INTO THE CENTRAL U.S. TONIGHT.  SURFACE LOW 
DEVELOPS OVER THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY BY 12Z TUE.  LOW THEN PUSHES UP 
THE OHIO VALLEY DURING THE DAY TUE.  MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT BROAD AREA OF QPF WILL ACCOMPANY THE SYSTEM. WILL UP POPS TO 90 
ACROSS THE FA. ETA IS QUICKER AND WEAKER THAN GFS WITH SURFACE LOW.  
NCEP POINTS OUT THAT THE GFS MIGHT BE TOO STRONG WITH THE LOW DUE TO 
CONVECTIVE FEED BACK.  WILL GO WITH A GFS/UKMET BLEND.

COLD FRONT SHOULD BISECT THE FA BY 18Z...THEN STRONG CAA PUSHES IN.  
RAINS SHOULD END FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST DURING THE 
AFTERNOON.  K INDICES PUSH TO NEAR 30...SO WILL KEEP THE MENTION OF 
THUNDER.  WINDS SHOULD PICK UP AS LOW PASSES.  WILL MENTION GUSTS TO 
35 MPH.

HIGH BUILDS IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST TUE NIGHT.  SOME DISAGREEMENT 
BETWEEN MODELS RH TUE NGT INTO WED.  GFS IS KEEPING QUITE OVER 80RH 
AT 850...WHILE ETA DROPS IT TO LESS THAN 50.  DO TO UNCERTAINTY WILL 
GO WITH A COMPROMISE.

HAVE ALREADY UPDATED ZONES FOR MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.  THE MOST NOTABLE

AROUND 40 ACROSS THE FA...SKIES ARE CLEAR AND WINDS ARE VERY LIGHT.  
CENTER OF HIGH IS EXPECTED TO MOVE RIGHT OVER FA OVERNIGHT.  THESE

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES MOISTURE WORKING ITS WAY UP FROM THE 
GULF STATES TO AN UPPER LOW OVER THE MID MS VLY. SURFACE ANALYSIS 
INDICATES SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW AROUND HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MID 
ATLANTIC STATES.  

MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING UPPER LOW OVER 
OHIO VALLEY AND DEEPENING IT SOMEWHAT.  MOISTURE FROM THE MID MS VLY 
ALONG WITH ATLANTIC MOISTURE WILL COMBINE WITH THE DEEPENING UPPER 
LOW TO BRING A GOOD THREAT OF SHOWERS TO THE REGION.  THE BEST LOW 
LEVEL FORCING WILL COME FROM LOW LEVEL JET OUT OF THE MID ATLANTIC.  
THREAT WANES DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY WITH LACK OF FORCING.  
HOWEVER, WITH UPPER LOW AND DEEP MOISTURE WILL KEEP SMALL THREAT 
AROUND.  FORECAST WILL THEN DRY OUT WITH THE NEXT THREAT OCCURRING 
ON SUNDAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF WEAK COLD FRONT.  WILL KEEP SMALL POPS 
(20/30).  WILL DISCOUNT THE FEED BACK WITH THE GFS FRIDAY NIGHT IN 
EASTERN OHIO/WEST VIRGINIA.

MAV TEMPS LOOK PRETTY GOOD.  A BIT TOO COOL FRIDAY AND SEVERAL 
DEGREES TOO COOL FOR SATURDAY WITH A LITTLE COMPRESSIONAL HEATING 
AHEAD OF COLD FRONT WILL HELP WARM THINGS UP.

TEMPS RANGED FROM THE LOW 50S TO NEAR 60 NORTH TO SOUTH AT 07Z.

ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SOME MODEL DIFFERENCES...THE 0Z RUNS HAVE COME

THIS AFTERNOON...BOTH MODELS SHOW SOME WEAK LL CONV...UPPER

WATER VAPOR AND MODEL DATA DEPICTED A SPLIT FLOW REGIME OVER THE ERN 
UNITED STATES THIS MORNING.  A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE AT THE H5 LVL 
WAS LOCATED ACRS THE GREAT LAKES WHILE AN H5 TROUGH WAS NOTED OVER 
THE SE UNITED STATES.  MEANWHILE...A SFC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
EXTENDED FROM THE NEW JERSEY SHORE WESTWARD INTO THE MIDWEST.

MODELS WERE INDICATING SOME 850 MB MSTR TO ROTATE AROUND LOW LVL 
HIGH PRESSURE TODAY.  THIS MAY CAUSE SOME CUMULUS CLOUDS TO DEVELOP 
ALONG I-70 SOUTHWEST INTO SRN INDIANA.  CUMULUS CLOUD COVERAGE 
SHOULD REMAIN IN THE FEW-SCT RANGE...SO AM NOT PLANNING TO UPDATE 
FORECAST FROM SUNNY TO MOSTLY SUNNY (A VERY MINOR CHANGE).  FCST

IT WAS CLEAR ACROSS THE REGION AGAIN THIS MORNING...WITH SFC HIGH 
PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL.  TEMPS RANGED FROM THE MID 40S IN 
TRADITIONAL COLD SPOTS IN THE EAST TO THE MID 50S AT 07Z.

FOR TODAY...EXPECT SUNNY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WITH TEMPS IN THE MID 
70S.  WILL CONTINUE TREND OF GOING SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN MAV GUIDANCE 
FOR LOWS TONIGHT WITH CLEAR SKIES.

SOME MODEL DIFFERENCES STILL COME INTO PLAY THURSDAY.  THE GFS HAS  
PCPN ENCROACHING INTO THE AREA ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK UPPER TROF IN 
THE SE AS WELL AS A CLOSED H5 LOW OVER NW KENTUCKY BY 0Z FRIDAY. IN 
CONTRAST...THE ETA AND ECMWF JUST HAVE A FAIRLY WEAK H5 TROF TO THE

FRIDAY EVEN FOR DAY.  THE ETA AND GFS SHOW SOME WEAK LL CONV 
CONFINED TO THE SOUTH AND EAST THROUGH THIS PERIOD...BUT LITTLE

THE GFS 305K ISENTROPIC SFC SHOWS SOME WEAK LIFT COUPLED WITH LOW

MOISTURE FROM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN IN AN EASTERLY LOW AND MID LEVEL

POPS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT BUT LEAVE THINGS DRY UNTIL THEN. ONLY

SFC BNDRY SOUTH OF OHIO RIVER WITH DEWPTS IN M50S AT SDF AND LEX.  
WEAK LIFT ASSOCD WITH BNDRY ONLY PRODUCING SCT CU ACRS NORTH CNTRL 
KY.

NICE COUPLE OF DAYS IN STORE FOR REGION AS HI PRES MOVES EAST INTO 
PENNSYLVANIA AND HOLDS THRU MIDWEEK.  SFC RIDGE WILL REMAIN ACRS 
FCST AREA WITH SOUTHERLY WINDS BRINGING WARMER AIR INTO OH VALLEY 
FOR TUES AND WED.  ATMOSPHERE BONE DRY OVER NEXT 36-42 HRS WITH WARM 
SUNNY DAYS AND CLEAR COOL NIGHTS.  850 WAA PATTERN DVLPS 
OVERNIGHT...BUT COOLEST BNDRY LAYER AIR WILL RESIDE ACRS CNTRL OH 
WHERE EXPECT TEMPS AS LOW AS U30S SOUTH AND EAST OF CMH.  
ELSEWHERE...LOWS GENERALLY IN 40-45 RANGE TONIGHT.  WARMED TEMPS A 
DEGREE OR SO TUES AND WED WITH 850 TEMPS CLIMBING TO 11-12 C.  THIS 
GAVE L70S FOR TUES AND M70S FOR WED...WHICH WAS CLOSE TO MAV/FWC 
GUID.  WENT BLO ALL GUID OVER NEXT THREE NIGHTS WITH CLR SKIES/LGT 
WINDS EXPECTED.  ALLOWED FOR SLOW INCREASE IN CLOUDS LATE WED ACRS 
PMH AREA WITH UPR LO TRACKING NE INTO APPALACHIANS...BUT STRONG SFC 
RIDGE SHOULD KEEP MUCH OF AREA FREE FROM CLOUDS WED.

ON THURSDAY...H5 LOW SOUTH OF FCST AREA SHOULD REMAIN RELATIVELY 
WEAK WITH AN OPEN WAVE, BUT PERSISTENT. SFC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL SHIFT NORTHWARD AND ALLOW FOR MOISTURE TO STREAM IN FROM THE 
ATLANTIC ON SELY MID LEVEL WINDS. LOW TEMPERATURES IN THE MORNING 
WILL RANGE A GOOD BIT WITH CLOUD COVER IN THE SOUTHEAST AND CLEAR 
SKIES TO THE NORTHWEST. THIS WILL ALSO MAKE AN EFFECT ON HIGHS 
DURING THE DAY. NORMAL FOR THIS TIME AT CVG IS 69. WOULD THINK THAT 
SKY AND INCREASED MOISTURE WOULD CUT READINGS BELOW CURRENT FCST 
TEMPS. 

SFC RIDGE OPENS UP A BIT BUT STILL REMAINS OVER NWRN FCST AREA FOR 
FRIDAY. EAST WINDS SHOULD HELP KEEP TEMPS DOWN A BIT DURING THE DAY 
HERE BUT NRN FCST AREA STANDS THE BEST CHANCE WITH WARMING AS THERE 
SHOULD BE A STRONG CUTOFF FROM MOCLEAR SKIES HERE TO OVERCAST SKIES 
IN THE SOUTHEAST. STILL FEEL THAT FRI IS ON THE WARM SIDE FOR THE 
FCST MAX TEMPS.

LONG TERM (FRI NIGHT THRU MONDAY)...OVERALL...WENT WITH A COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND MRF.  AS SURFACE HIGH COUNTIES TO TRACK 
EAST...KEPT FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY DRY.  INTRODUCED POPS EARLY 
SUNDAY WITH APPROACH OF COLD FRONT FROM THE NORTHWEST.  ANOTHER

TODAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY JUST SHOWING SOME PATCHY CLOUDS AT THIS TIME. IT DOES NOT 
APPEAR THAT THESE WILL BE SIGNIFICANT.

RATHER QUIET FALL PATTERN AS UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST 
CONTINUES TO LIFT OUT. MEANWHILE WEAK UPPER LOW WILL DEVELOP IN THE 
MID SOUTH AND SLIDE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER IN THE 
WEEK. SO FORECAST AREA WILL BE IN BETWEEN SYSTEMS. THE SURFACE HIGH 
ACROSS THE LAKES WILL SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST WITH THE RIDGE AXIS 
EXTENDING BACK INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. MOISTURE WILL BE VERY LIMITED 
WITH MOSTLY SUNNY DAYS AND CLEAR NIGHTS THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE 
OF THE WEEK AND LIKELY BEYOND. STILL A LITTLE UNCERTAINTY TOWARDS 
THE END OF THE WEEK CONCERNING THE UPPER LOW IN THE SOUTH AND 
WHETHER THAT TRIES TO LIFT NORTH. ALSO SOME ENERGY WILL BE 
APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. BUT WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST.

LOW LEVEL THICKNESS SUGGESTS THAT HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE 
JUST SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN YESTERDAY. BUT THEN SHOULD SEE A 
CONTINUATION OF THE WARM UP WITH READINGS IN THE MID 70S AREAWIDE BY

BUT SOME SCT CU SHOULD DEVELOP IN MOST OF CWA OUTSIDE OF THIS AS/CS 
DECK. BEST CU SHOULD BE NORTH OF THE CLOUD SHIELD TOWARDS CLE FCST 
AREA CLOSEST TO COLD POOL. 

WITH OR WITHOUT THE CU DEVELOPMENT TODAY, THERE SHOULD BE SOME HIGH 
CLOUDS PROVIDING A FILTER TO SOME OF THE SUNSHINE AND PARTLY SUNNY 
SHOULD WORK IN MOST AREAS EXCEPT THE SOUTHEAST. 

MAX HEATING FROM MORNING SOUNDING WITH OVC SKIES THROUGH NOON AT ILN 
WAS CALCULATED AT 64-65 DEGREES AND IS IN LINE WITH FCST MAX TEMPS. 

HAVE ADJUSTED THE TEMP GRIDS HOURLY BUT DONT FEEL THAT THE CLOUD

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES COLD FRONT WELL TO OUR EAST WITH WESTERLY 
COLD AIR ADVECTION OVER FA.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CU 
DEVELOPED IN THE WAKE OF COLD FRONT WITH IT BEING THICKEST OVER NE 
PART OF FA. 

MODELS ARE IN RELATIVELY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH KEEPING MID LEVEL TROF 
OVER THE REGION THROUGH EARLY THIS WEEK BEFORE THE FLOW FLATTENS 
OUT.  WITH THIS SAID THERE ARE SEVERAL CONCERNS.  ONE IS A LOW LEVEL 
30 TO 40 KT LOW LEVEL JET THAT WILL BE WORKING ACROSS THE FA 
OVERNIGHT.  MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE LIMITED...THUS WILL LEAVE OUT OF 
FORECAST FOR NOW.  HOWEVER...LATTER SHIFTS WILL HAVE TO WATCH FOR 
ANY LIGHT SHOWER/SPRINKLE DEVELOPMENT.  NEXT CONCERN REVOLVES AROUND 
A WEAK WARM FRONT ACROSS SOUTHERN FA.  SUNDAY INTO MONDAY MORNING.  
SOME MOISTURE AND WEEK LIFT COULD CREATE A FEW SHOWERS.  THIS IS 
CURRENTLY IN THE FORECAST AND WILL LEAVE IN.  SURFACE HIGH BUILDS 
INTO THE REGION MONDAY AFTERNOON AND REMAINS DOMINATE THROUGH THE 
END OF THE WEEK.  AT MID LEVELS RIDGING BEGINS THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY 
BRINGING A WARM UP TO AT LEAST NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

WESTERN RIDGE AND EASTERN TROF PERSIST IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OVER 
THE CONUS.  SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING TO NEW ENGLAND TODAY IS 
ALLOWING HEIGHT RISES OVER THE OHIO VALLEY THAT WILL CONTINUE INTO 
FRIDAY.  NEXT GROUP OF SHORT WAVES WILL DROP INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
FRIDAY NIGHT WITH ASSOCIATED HEIGHT FALLS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY ON 
SATURDAY AND ONLY SLIGHT WARMING ALOFT FOR SUNDAY. 

SURFACE MAP HAS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING EAST INTO ILN CWA.  HIGH WILL 
BE PUSHED OUT RAPIDLY BY THE NEXT CHUNK OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY BY LATE 
FRIDAY.  FRONT SWINGING DOWN FROM LOW OVER SOUTHERN CANADA IS 
PROGGED TO REACH OUR AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND THEN CROSS THE 
REGION ON SATURDAY. MODELS HAVE SLOWED PROGRESS OF THE FRONT 
SLIGHTLY ON SATURDAY. 

SHORT TERM PROBLEM INVOLVES TONIGHTS FREEZE.  THOUGH AXIS OF 
SURFACE HIGH IS PROGGED TO BE THROUGH BY FRIDAY 12Z...AND A FEW HIGH 
CLOUDS MAY BE FILTERING IN...I STILL THINK THAT WITH DEW POINTS IN 
THE 20S AND LIGHT WINDS WE WILL SEE WIDESPREAD FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES.  THEREFORE WE WILL HOIST A FREEZE WARNING FOR THE 
SECOND STRAIGHT DAY.

FRIDAYS DAYTIME FORECAST WILL FEATURE INCREASING CLOUDS AND SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTHWEST.  WITH FRONTS APPROACH MORE 
CERTAIN...IM RAISING POPS TO LIKELY ALL ZONES FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.  
WITH THE EXPECTED SLOWER PROGRESS OF THE FRONT...ILL EXTEND LIKELY 
POPS INTO SATURDAY ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN ZONES...WITH HIGH CHANCE IN 
THE NORTH.

TEMPS:  LEANING TOWARD WARMER ETA AND FWC ON FRIDAY IN WARM 
ADVECTION AND COMPRESSIONAL HEATING AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  COOLER MAV 
SEEMS THE WAY TO GO FOR SATURDAY WITH CLOUDS AND PRECIP AROUND.

CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED:  ONCE WE GET PAST A MINOR CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
ON SUNDAY...A DRY PATTERN IS FORECAST TO BECOME ESTABLISHED THROUGH 
MOST OF NEXT WEEK.  SHORT WAVE IS NOW PROGGED TO BE FARTHER NORTH ON 
MONDAY...SO IM REMOVING 30 POPS.  OTHER CHANGES INVOLVE RAISING

.DISCUSSION...
WESTERN RIDGE AND EASTERN TROF PERSIST IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE OVER 
THE CONUS.  SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING TO NEW ENGLAND TODAY IS 
ALLOWING HEIGHT RISES OVER THE OHIO VALLEY THAT WILL CONTINUE INTO 
FRIDAY.  NEXT GROUP OF SHORT WAVES WILL DROP INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
FRIDAY NIGHT WITH ASSOCIATED HEIGHT FALLS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY ON 
SATURDAY AND ONLY SLIGHT WARMING ALOFT FOR SUNDAY. 

SURFACE MAP HAS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING EAST INTO ILN CWA.  HIGH WILL 
BE PUSHED OUT RAPIDLY BY THE NEXT CHUNK OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY BY LATE 
FRIDAY.  FRONT SWINGING DOWN FROM LOW OVER SOUTHERN CANADA IS 
PROGGED TO REACH OUR AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND THEN CROSS THE 
REGION ON SATURDAY. MODELS HAVE SLOWED PROGRESS OF THE FRONT 
SLIGHTLY ON SATURDAY. 

SHORT TERM PROBLEM INVOLVES TONIGHTS FREEZE.  THOUGH AXIS OF 
SURFACE HIGH IS PROGGED TO BE THROUGH BY FRIDAY 12Z...AND A FEW HIGH 
CLOUDS MAY BE FILTERING IN...I STILL THINK THAT WITH DEW POINTS IN 
THE 20S AND LIGHT WINDS WE WILL SEE WIDESPREAD FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES.  THEREFORE WE WILL HOIST A FREEZE WARNING FOR THE 
SECOND STRAIGHT DAY.

FRIDAYS DAYTIME FORECAST WILL FEATURE INCREASING CLOUDS AND SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTHWEST.  WITH FRONTS APPROACH MORE 
CERTAIN...IM RAISING POPS TO LIKELY ALL ZONES FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.  
WITH THE EXPECTED SLOWER PROGRESS OF THE FRONT...ILL EXTEND LIKELY 
POPS INTO SATURDAY ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN ZONES...WITH HIGH CHANCE IN 
THE NORTH.

TEMPS:  LEANING TOWARD WARMER ETA AND FWC ON FRIDAY IN WARM 
ADVECTION AND COMPRESSIONAL HEATING AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  COOLER MAV 
SEEMS THE WAY TO GO FOR SATURDAY WITH CLOUDS AND PRECIP AROUND.

CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED:  ONCE WE GET PAST A MINOR CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
ON SUNDAY...A DRY PATTERN IS FORECAST TO BECOME ESTABLISHED THROUGH 
MOST OF NEXT WEEK.  SHORT WAVE IS NOW PROGGED TO BE FARTHER NORTH ON 
MONDAY...SO IM REMOVING 30 POPS.  OTHER CHANGES INVOLVE RAISING 
TEMPS A BIT AS A GOOD DEAL OF WARMING ALOFT IS SHOWN ON THE 
MRF...THOUGH I WILL NOT BE GOING AS HIGH AS MEX GUIDANCE.

AT 07Z...A WEAK COLD FRONT WAS NOTED FROM LAKE MICHIGAN...SW INTO 
WRN IL AND NRN MO.  THIS WEAK FRONT WILL MOVE ACRS THE CWFA DURING 
THE DAYLIGHT HOURS.

CURRENT IR SATELLITE SHOWS MAINLY CLEAR SKIES ACRS THE REGION.  SOME 
LOWER AND MID CLOUDS WERE LOCATED WITH THE FRONT...WITH SOME LIGHT 
SHOWER ACTIVITY AS FAR S AS CHICAGO.  FRONT WILL BE MOISTURE STARVED 
ACRS OUR AREA...SO AM NOT EXPECTING ANY PCPN TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...FRONT PASSES TO THE SOUTH AND EAST.  HOWEVER... WITH

MAIN UPR LVL S/WV WAS MOVING ACRS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AT THIS

SUBSIDENCE BEHIND THE S/WV BECOMES EVIDENT OVER THE ENTIRE REGION.  
WITH CAA AND RESIDUAL 850 MB MSTR TODAY...WILL SEE CUMULUS 
DEVELOPMENT BY LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON.  THUS...AM EXPECTING 
PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS.  TEMPS WILL REMAIN ON THE COOL 
SIDE...RANGING FROM THE LOWER 50S NW TO THE UPPER 50S SE.

FOR TONIGHT...A SFC TROF WILL MOVE ACRS THE LOWER GREAT 
LAKES...USHERING IN ANOTHER SHOT OF COLD AIR.  UPR DYNAMICS WITH THE 
ASSOCD SFC TROF SHOULD STAY CONFINED TO THE LOWER GREAT LAKES.  
ALSO...LAKE EFFECT SHOWERS...MIXED WITH SNOW AT TIMES...WILL STAY 
OVER THE PREDOMINANT SNOW BELT AREAS OF NE INDIANA AND NE OHIO.
AS A RESULT...AM ANTICIPATING A GRADUAL DISSIPATION OF AFTN CU THIS 
EVENING...ALLOWING SKIES TO BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR.  SOME OF THE CLOUDS 
OFF OF LAKE MICHIGAN MAY TICKLE THE FAR NWRN CWFA THROUGH 06Z...THEN 
MODELS SHIFT THE 850 MB FLOW FROM NWLY TO NRLY AFT 06Z...ALLOWING 
FOR CLEARING SKIES THERE.  WITH MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS/DRY LOW LVL 
AIR...TEMPS WILL DROP INTO THE UPPER 20S IN SHELTER LOCATIONS TO THE 
MID 30S IN HIGHER/FLATTER TERRAIN (WHERE WIND SPEEDS WILL PREVENT 
FREEZING TEMPS).  HENCE...WILL CONTINUE THE FREEZE WATCH FOR TONIGHT.

SOME OF THE COLDEST AIR THIS FALL SEASON WILL BE EXPERIENCED ON 
THURSDAY AS 850 MB TEMPS DROP TO -4 C TO -5 C.  PURE 850 MB 
ADIABATIC MIXING TO THE SURFACE WILL YIELD HIGHS IN THE MID AND 
UPPER 40S.  AT THIS TIME...WILL COLLABORATE WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES 
AND GO WITH UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S...ANTICIPATING A HIGHER TEMP DUE 
TO POSSIBLE SUPER ADIABAT NEAR SFC.

NEXT CHC FOR PCPN WILL COME LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY AS A COLD 
FRONT MOVES INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VLY.  HAVE BUMPED POPS UP 
INTO THE 40S AND 50S FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

IT LOOKS LIKE BELOW NORMAL TEMPS WILL CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND AS

A POSSIBILITY.

HAVE MOVED UP PCPN TIMING A BIT TO LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON IN SW AS

DECENT ISENTROPIC LIFT THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT THE ETA HAS PUSHED THIS

ACROSS SOUTHEAST PORTIONS OF FA AND APPEARS SEVERE THREAT JUST ABOUT 
OVER FOR OUR AREA. WILL SEND AN UPDATE TO THE ZONES SHORTLY TO CLEAR 
NEXT TIER OF COUNTIES FROM WATCH. COLD FRONT JUST ABOUT TO PUSH INTO 
WESTERN PORTIONS OF FA WITH STILL SOME SHOWERS AND A FEW

FOR EARLY THIS MORNING ALL AREAS BUT WITH DRIER AIR WORKING IN 
BEHIND FRONT...SHOULD SEE SKIES BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY FROM WEST TO

LITTLE TRICKY FOR TODAY WITH CURRENT READINGS PRETTY CLOSE TO

HAVE UPDATED TO INCLUDE CATEGORICAL CHANCE OF RAIN WITH HEAVY RAIN 
WORDING. GRIDS DIDNT MATCH ENTIRELY FOR TOMORROW, SO I TOOK 
EXPECTED BACK EDGE OF PRECIP AND CUT THINGS TO NOTHING NORTHWEST OF 
IT AND KEPT HIGH CHANCE FOR EARLY TOMORROW MORNING EAST OF IT. 

LLVL JET SHOULD CONTINUE TO ADVECT MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY TO FCST 
AREA TONIGHT. IT REALLY KICKS IN PER MODEL SOLUTIONS AROUND 6Z AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT WITH 60KT+ AT 850MB. IF THIS COULD GET CAUGHT UP IN THE 
STORMS BEHIND THE SHIFT THEN DAMAGING WIND IS LIKELY WITH ENTIRE 
LINE THATS MOVING THROUGH. HOWEVER, MOST OF THE INSTABILITY AND 
ACUTAL CONVECTION ARE ELEVATED AND COULD HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING TO 
THE SFC. EXPECT A COUPLE OF SEVERES TO BE ISSUED TONIGHT WHERE BEST 
FEATURES ARE ALONG THE SQUALL LINE (BOWING SEGMENTS, MARCS, ETC). 
TORNADIC ACTIVITY IS STILL POSSIBLE BUT IM CONSIDERING THE MAIN 
THREAT BEING FOR STRAIGHT LINE WINDS ACROSS A POSSIBLY LARGE SWATH.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES WARM FRONT NEAR OHIO RIVER WITH TDS 
AROUND OR ABOVE 60 ACROSS FAR SOUTHERN OHIO INTO KY.  KILN SHOWING 
SHRA/TSRA APPROACHING FROM SOUTHERN INDIANA.  WATER VAPOR SHOWING A 
RAPIDLY CHANGING AIRMASS WITH SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL JETS.

AIRMASS WILL GO THROUGH A RAPID CHANGE ACROSS OHIO VALLEY TODAY.  
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL BRING IN WARMER AND MOISTER AIR INTO THE 
REGION.  UPPER LEVEL JET WILL CREATE ENVIRONMENT FOR A DEEPENING 
UPPER LOW OVER THE MID MS VLY AND THEN SWINGING ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT RAPIDLY DURING THE OVERNIGHT PERIODS. 

TWO AREAS HAVE MY MAIN CONCERN ONE IS ALONG THE CURRENT WARM FRONT.  
THIS FRONT SHOULD NOT MOVE TO FAR INTO FA UNTIL LOW APPROACHES.  
SOUTH OF WARM FRONT BOTH THE LATEST RUC AND ETA INDICATE GREATER 
THAN A 1000 J/KG ALONG WITH HELICITIES OVER 200 M2/S2.  HOWEVER THE 
LIFT IS NOT PROGGED TO BE THAT IMPRESSIVE.  HOWEVER...WAVE OVER 
IL/IN WILL BE PROPAGATING INTO OHIO. ANY STORM THAT DOES DEVELOP 
ALONG THE WARM FRONT WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED FOR ROTATION AND 
SEVERE THREAT.  NEXT CONCERN IS WARM FRONT LIFTING RAPIDLY THROUGH 
THE WESTERN FA AND THE APPROACH AND PASSAGE OF COLD FRONT.  60+ TDS 
ARE EXPECTED IN THE WARM SECTOR WITH >1000 J/G AND HELICITIES >400 
M2/S2.  IF A RESPECTABLE INVERSION DOES NOT SET UP THEN 
SEVERE/ROTATING THUNDERSTORMS COULD BE A PROBLEM OVERNIGHT.

HAVE ADJUSTED SKY COVER DOWN TO COOINCIDE WITH CLEAR SKIES AHEAD OF 
APPROACHING CDFNT. THIS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS AHEAD OF THE FRONT TO 
DROP, AND THEN A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN DEWPOINTS AND POSSIBLY 
TEMPERATURE IMMEDIATELY AHEAD OF FRONT DUE TO GOOD SWLY FLOW AND 
ADVECTION.

DONT THINK THAT SOUTHERN FCST AREA WILL SEE MANY CLOUD TO GROUND 
STRIKES WITH THIS SYSTEM AS IT MOVES THROUGH. THE CONVECTION SHOULD 
BE MORE SCATTERED IN THE SOUTH AWAY FROM THE DYNAMICS...AND THIS IS 
COMBINED WITH AN UNFAVORABLE DIURNAL TIME FOR ACTIVITY AND THE

MARGINAL DUE TO TIMING.  FRONT WILL BE PASSING AFTER 00Z (I.E. PEAK 
DAYTIME HEATING)...THUS LIMITING THE ALREADY MARGINAL INSTABILITY.  
CONVECTION SHOULD BE WEAKENING ACROSS NE INDIANA/NW OHIO.  WILL 
LINGER THREAT OF SHOWERS IN THE MORNING ACROSS THE FAR SOUTH AS 
FRONT CONTINUES TO SLIDE SOUTH.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP THINGS DRY FROM THU/FRI.  UPPER TROF 
DIGS SOUTH FRIDAY NT INTO SATURDAY BRINGING BACK THE THREAT OF 
SHRA/TSRA.  DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE THE THUNDERSTORMS 
COULD BE ON THE STRONG SIDE AS SIGNIFICANT WAVE DIVES SOUTH CREATING

CURRENT SFC ANALYSIS INDCG COLD FRNT FROM WESTERN GRT LKS SW INTO 
CNTRL PLAINS WITH WARM FRNT ACRS CNTRL INDIANA.  GOOD AREA OF 
SHRA/TSRA PERSISTING ACRS NRN INDIANA EAST INTO WEST CNTRL OH ALONG 
BNDRY AND AT NOSE OF 850 LL JET.  CLOUD SHIELD FROM STORMS 
OVERSPREADING MUCH OF NORTHERN 1/2 FCST AREA.

UPDATING TO MAKE ADJUSTMENTS IN REGARDS TO PCPN THIS MORNING.  
LEADING EDGE OF PCPN HAS SHOWN A BIT OF A WEAKENING TREND IN LAST 
HOUR AS SHRA MOVNG INTO MUCH DRIER AIRMASS OVER REGION.  
HOWEVER...ACTIVITY IS HOLDING TOGETHER WITH PCPN BAND NOW SET UP 
WEST-EAST INTO MERCER AND AUGLAIZE COUNTIES.  CURRENT RUC DATA INDCG 
850 LL JET WEAKENS AS IT MOVES EAST INTO EARLY AFTN.  THIS WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT PCPN SHOULD BECOME MORE SCT WITH MUCH OF NRN 1/2 FCST 
AREA PCPN FREE BY 18-19Z.  WILL CONTINUE PCPN MENTION THRU ERLY AFTN 
NORTH OF DAY...AND NEED TO ADD PCPN MENTION INTO CMH ZONE AS SHRA 
LIKELY TO AFFECT PORTIONS OF UNION/DELAWARE COS.  PLAN TO RAISE TO 
LKLY POPS FOR FEW HRS ACRS WEST CNTRL COS BASED ON CURRENT RADAR 
TRENDS. SHARP SOUTHERN EDGE TO PCPN AREA AND ALL SHRA/TSRA SHOULD 
REMAIN NORTH OF I-70.

12Z KILN SOUNDING SUPPORTING M70S THIS AFTN TAKING INTO ACCOUNT GOOD 
AMOUNT OF AC/CI.  AM A BIT CONCERNED THAT MAY STRUGGLE TO REACH 70 
IN FAR NW FCST AREA EVEN WITH RECOVERY TO PTLY CLDY SKIES BY AFTN.  
WILL LOWER TEMPS A FEW DEGREES THIS AREA.  ELSEWHERE...FCST TEMPS 
AND WINDS LOOK ON TRACK.  ONCE WARM FRNT SHIFTS EAST LATER THIS

HAVE ADJUSTED SKY COVER DOWN TO COOINCIDE WITH CLEAR SKIES AHEAD OF 
APPROACHING CDFNT. THIS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS AHEAD OF THE FRONT TO 
DROP, AND THEN A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN DEWPOINTS AND POSSIBLY 
TEMPERATURE IMMEDIATELY AHEAD OF FRONT DUE TO GOOD SWLY FLOW AND 
ADVECTION.

DONT THINK THAT SOUTHERN FCST AREA WILL SEE MANY CLOUD TO GROUND 
STRIKES WITH THIS SYSTEM AS IT MOVES THROUGH. THE CONVECTION SHOULD 
BE MORE SCATTERED IN THE SOUTH AWAY FROM THE DYNAMICS...AND THIS IS 
COMBINED WITH AN UNFAVORABLE DIURNAL TIME FOR ACTIVITY AND THE 
ELEVATED NATURE OF THE INSTABILITY.

RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH ISABEL HAS ENDED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
ISABEL WAS LOCATED ABOUT 50 MILES NORTHEAST OF CLEVELAND LATE THIS 
MORNING AND WAS CONTINUING TO MOVE TOWARD THE NORTH AT AROUND 30 
MPH. SOME INCREASE IN SPEED IS EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
WITH INCREASE IN SPEED OF ISABEL...WIND DIRECTION HAS BEEN ADJUSTED 
IN UPDATE TO WEST.

FRONT LOCATED WEST OF FORECAST AREA THROUGH INDIANA WILL WEAKEN AS 
IT MOVES EAST. LITTLE CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION EXPECTED WITH THIS 
FRONT TODAY SO HAVE REMOVED PRECIPITATION FROM FORECAST ON UPDATE. 
HOWEVER...THERE IS AN EXTENSIVE BAND OF LOW AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT. HAVE OPTED TO GO WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS 
AFTERNOON IN LIGHT OF THIS. FEW OTHER CHANGES MADE.

SHORT TERM FCST DOESNT HAVE MUCH CHANGES TO IT THIS AFTERNOON. AM 
NOT MENTIONING ANY THUNDER WITH ISABEL REMNANTS OVER WRN FCST AREA 
AS DOWNSLOPE AND SUBSIDENCE SHOULD OVERRIDE ANY DEEP CONVECTION 
SPILLING OVER THE APPALACHIANS. 

WE REMAIN CAUGHT BETWEEN THE FAR WESTERN EDGE OF ISABEL AND A COLD 
FRONT THAT IS MOVING INTO UNFAVORABLE CONDITIONS AND ACTUALLY 
WEAKENING AND SLOWING AS THE ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH IT GETS SHUNTED 
NORTH THE CLOSER IT GETS TO WRN FCST AREA. CANNOT RULE OUT PRECIP 
BUT AM PLAYING THIS DOWN WITH SLIGHT CHANCE WORDING IN THE SOUTHWEST 
BOTH LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY. 

TEMPS WERE ON AND ONLY MINOR TWEEKS WERE MADE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

EXTENDED MODELS IN FAIR AGREEMENT. LOOKING AT 0Z WED FOR A 
COMPARISON BETWEEN MRF, CANADIAN, AND UKMET THEY ALL SHOW THAT THE 
FRONT HAS PASSED THROUGH OHIO WITH SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BACK 
IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST. A WEAK SECONDARY TROF IS BEING HINTED AT BY 
BOTH MRF AND CANADIAN BUT THIS SHOULD STAY FAR ENOUGH NORTH TO LIMIT 
THE QPF SHOWN ON MRF OVERNIGHT TUES. H5 AT THIS TIME IS ALSO SHOWING 
THE TROF DIRECTLY OVER FCST AREA AND QUICKLY EXITING NORTHEAST. SFC 
HIGH PASSES SOUTH OF OHVLY AND WEAK H5 RIDGE BUILDS IN.

THIS PATTERN SHOULD RESULT IN A DRY FCST WITH A DECENT COOL-DOWN IN 
TEMPERATURES BOTH ON HIGHS AND ESPECIALLY LOWS IF WE CLEAR OUT AT 
NIGHT. COOLEST NIGHT SHOULD BE SAT/SUN AM WHERE TAIL END OF HIGH IS 
CLOSEST TO FCST AREA. WARM ADVECTION SHOULD KICK IN ON THE BACK SIDE 
HERE AND INCREASED MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE FRONT THAT SHOULD AFFECT 
THE REGION MONDAY WILL CUT HIGHS MONDAY AND RAISE LOWS SUN NIGHT AND 
MON NIGHT BEFORE THE FRONT ACTUALLY PASSES EARLY TUES MORNING. 
CLOUDS AND CAA TUES WILL CUT HIGHS TO THE UPPER 60S AND WE CAN 
EXPECT A GRADUAL CLEARING WITH COOL NIGHTTIME LOWS AND AT OR BELOW

CURRENT IR SAT INDCG OUTER CI SHIELD FROM ISABEL DRIFTING NORTH AND 
WEST ACRS APPALACHIAN MTS.  SKIES WERE CLEAR ACRS FCST AREA THIS 
MRNG WITH TEMPS IN M/U50S.

FCST PACKAGE WILL FOCUS ON ISABEL AS SHE MAKES LANDFALL THIS AFTN IN 
N CAROLINA.  ALL MODELS NOW WELL ALIGNED ON THE STORM MOVING ASHORE BTWN 
CAPE LOOKOUT AND CAPE HATTERAS AROUND 18Z.  ISABEL THEN PROGGED TO 
TRACK NNW THRU CNTRL VA OVERNIGHT INTO WESTERN PA FRI MRNG.  FCST 
GRIDS IN EXCELLENT SHAPE AND MADE ONLY MINOR TWEAKS REGARDING 
AFFECTS OF ISABEL ON FCST AREA.

WILL SEE SLOW INCREASE IN CI TODAY AS ISABEL APPCHS COAST.  MAY EVEN 
SEE MID LVL AC MOVE INTO FAR EASTERN COUNTIES TOWARDS NIGHTFALL.  
WILL CONTINUE PTLY CLDY MENTION FOR EASTERN 1/2 FCST AREA WHILE 
MSTLY SUNNY WILL WORK FINE ACROSS WESTERN COUNTIES.  EXPECT SIMILAR 
TEMPS TO WED WITH BNDRY LAYER GENERALLY UNCHANGED. WARMEST TEMPS 
ACRS WESTERN 1/2 FCST AREA WITH MORE SUNSHINE.  AS REMNANTS OF 
ISABEL APPCH OVERNIGHT...INFLUX OF TROPICAL MOISTURE WILL ALLOW FOR 
SKIES TO GO MSTLY CLDY.  EXPECT SHRA TO BEGIN AFFECTING AREAS EAST 
OF US ROUTE 23 AFTER 04Z...WITH GREATEST AFFECTS LATE TONIGHT INTO 
FRI FROM LOGAN TO NEWARK.  LIKELY TO BE A SHARP CUTOFF TO WESTERN 
EXTENT OF PCPN.  HAVE CONTINUED HI CHC/LKLY POPS ACRS EASTERN COUNTIES 
WITH SLIM CHC (20 POPS) FOR MIAMI VALLEY AND PORTIONS OF TRI STATE 
EAST OF I-75.  HEAVIER RAINS FROM ISABEL SHOULD REMAIN EAST OF FCST 
AREA ACROSS WESTERN PA/EXTREME EASTERN OH.  STILL EXPECTING BREEZY 
CONDITIONS (15-25 MPH) LATE TONIGHT INTO FRI AS ISABEL PASSES TO 
EAST.

ADJUSTED POPS TIMING FOR FRI AS ISABEL QUICKLY SHIFTS NORTH INTO 
ONTARIO.  00Z GFS/UKMET RUNS WERE A COUPLE HRS FASTER WITH ISABELS 
FORWARD MOTION.  UPR LVL TROF AND ASSOCD FRNTL BNDRY MOVNG INTO 
WESTERN GRT LKS LOOKING WEAKER AND WEAKER...AS ISABEL ROBBING ALL 
ITS MOISTURE.  CANNOT RULE OUT -SHRA AS THIS FEATURE TRACKS INTO 
REGION FRI AFTN...BUT HAVE GENERALLY DROPPED POPS ACRS WESTERN ZONES 
BACK INTO SLIGHT CHC AND EXPECT ANY PCPN WILL BE DONE BY LATE AFTN.  
FURTHER EAST...MORE WIDESPREAD SHRA FROM ISABEL SHOULD BE OUT OF 
FCST AREA BY 18Z...WITH ONLY SLIM CHC IN CNTRL OH FOR -SHRA INTO 
EVNG HRS AS FRNTL BNDRY SHIFTS TO EAST.  

MODEL SOUNDINGS INDCG RAPID DRYING BEHIND BNDRY AS HI PRES MOVES 
INTO OH VALLEY. EXPECT ENTIRE FCST AREA WILL HAVE CLR SKIES BY DAWN 
SAT.  NOT LIKELY TO BE ABUNDANT CU DVLPMNT SAT AS CAA IS SHORT LIVED 
WITH 850 TEMPS WARMING BY SAT EVNG.  HI PRES WILL KEEP DRY WX ACRS 
REGION UNTIL ERLY NEXT WEEK.

TEMPS...MADE VERY FEW CHANGES TO TEMPS THRU SAT.  MAV GUID FRI NIGHT 
APPEARS TOO AGGRESSIVE IN BRINGING M40S INTO MUCH OF FCST AREA.  
WITH GRADIENT LIKELY TO STAY UP FOR A BIT FRI NIGHT...KEPT TEMPS 2-3 
DEGREES ABV MAV GUID.

EXTENDED...STRONG COLD FRONT WITH DIGGING S/WV TRACKING INTO WESTERN

CURRENT SFC ANALYSIS INDCG BROAD AREA OF HI PRES ACRS OH VALLEY THIS 
MRNG.  UPR TROF OVER NORTHERN MICHIGAN WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK NORTH 
AND EAST AWAY FROM THE REGION TODAY.  COOL MORNING WITH TEMPS IN THE 
L/M50S.

QUIET WX WILL DOMINATE FOR NEXT 60 HRS AS HI PRES TRACKS ACRS REGION 
TODAY AND UPR RIDGE DVLPS ACRS GRT LKS AND OH VALLEY.  RESULT WILL 
BE PLEASANT DAYS WITH ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND COOL COMFORTABLE 
NIGHTS.  MAY SEE A FEW CU POP TODAY AS INDICATED BY MODEL 
SOUNDINGS...BUT NICE CAP SETTING UP BTWN 8 AND 10KFT AND ATMOSPHERE 
EXTREMELY DRY.

TWO WX FEATURES WILL HELP DETERMINE HOW THINGS PLAY OUT ACRS REGION 
BEGINNING LATE THURS THRU FRI.  FIRST IS OF COURSE HURRICANE 
ISABEL.  ISABEL HAS WEAKENED OVER LAST 24 HRS BUT STILL REMAINS 
QUITE A FORMIDABLE STORM.  ALL MODELS HAVE COME INTO PRETTY GOOD 
AGREEMENT REGARDING TRACK AND TIMING OF LANDFALL.  BOTH THE 00Z RUNS 
OF THE ETA...GFS AND UKMET HAVE STRENGTHENED THE SFC HI AS IT TRACKS INTO 
NEW ENGLAND WED AND THE UPR RIDGE ACRS THE REGION.  THIS HAS 
RESULTED IN STEERING ISABEL FURTHER TO THE WEST...WITH THE GFS AND 
UKMET MAKING LANDFALL NEAR CAPE LOOKOUT NC THURS EVNG...AND THE ETA 
BRINGING IT ASHORE FURTHER TO SW NEAR WILMINGTON NC.  THE FURTHER 
WEST TRACK MAY BRING ISABEL UP THRU WESTERN PA FRI AFTN...AND THUS 
MAY CAUSE A GREATER IMPACT OF THE INCLEMENT WX (RAIN/WIND) ASSOCD 
WITH ISABEL TO THE FCST AREA.  THE SECOND PLAYER IS A FRNTL BNDRY 
ASSOCD WITH AN UPR TROF TRACKING OUT OF THE PLAINS ON THURS.  BOTH 
THE GFS AND ETA TRACK THIS ACRS THE FCST AREA FRI...AND THIS ALONG 
WITH THE REMNANTS OF ISABEL ARE LIKELY TO ENHANCE PCPN CHCS ACRS 
REGION FRI.  FEEL GREATEST CHC FOR PCPN FRI WILL BE ACRS FAR EASTERN 
COUNTIES CLOSEST TO ISABELS TRACK.  ALSO BEEFING UP WINDS ON FRI AS 
BREEZY CONDITIONS ARE LIKELY WITH ISABEL PASSING TO OUR EAST.  FOR 
MORE INFO ON ISABEL...SEE HTTP://WWW.NHC.NOAA.GOV.

TEMPS...LITTLE CHANGES MADE THRU THURS.  MET/FWC GUID LOOKED TOO 
WARM TODAY SO WENT CLOSER TO MAV.  ALL GUID CLOSE THRU REMAINDER OF 
SHORT TERM AND DID NOT STRAY.

EXTENDED...UPR TROF MOVING THRU REGION FRI WILL HELP TO SCOOP UP 
ISABEL TO NORTH AND EAST SATURDAY.  COOL HI PRES WILL BUILD INTO GRT 
LKS AND OH VALLEY IN ITS WAKE FOR THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE AREA FOR FRIDAY.  FRIDAY 
SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO TODAY...WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND TEMPS

THE CRUX OF FCST IS THE TIMING OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT...AND THE

TO SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF THE FRONT.  IN FACT...IN THE SHORT 
TERM...THE 12Z GFS IS NOW PERHAPS EVEN SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN THE 12Z

ALL OF IS TO THE W AND SE.  CURRENT FCST OF POPS LATE IN WEST 
SATURDAY CARRYING INTO SUNDAY...STILL LOOKS REASONABLE GIVEN THE

HOWEVER SOME SIG DIFFERENCES DO EMERGE...AS THE ETA MOVES THE MID 
ATLANTIC SYSTEM FARTHER EAST ON SUNDAY...HINDERING THE PROGRESSION 
OF THE FRONT...WHILE THE GFS PUSHES THE FRONT THROUGH BY SUNDAY 
NIGHT/MONDAY.  THE ECMWF IS ALSO SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN THE GFS

QUIET WEATHER TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS. IN FACT DRIER AIR WILL BE ADVECTED IN FROM THE EAST. THIS 
SHOULD LEAD TO TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN THE PAST DAY OR 
TWO. EXPECT TO SEE FOG AGAIN IN THE MORNING BUT LESS SO BY FRIDAY 
MORNING BECAUSE OF THE DRIER AIR. THERE SHOULD JUST BE SOME DIURNAL 
CUMULUS IN THE AFTERNOON WITH CLEAR SKIES AT NIGHT AND INTO THE 
MORNING.

MODEL DISCREPANCIES MAKE WEEKEND FORECAST MORE CHALLENGING. ETA IS 
QUITE SLOW WITH APPROACHING FRONT WHILE GFS IS PROGRESSIVE. THIS HAS 
TO DO WITH HOW THE MODELS HANDLE UPPER LEVEL ENERGY IN THE PLAINS 
AND ALSO THE SYSTEM MOVING ON SHORE IN THE MID ATLANTIC. LOW 
CONFIDENCE IN TIMING. HAVE GONE WITH SOMETHING OF A COMPROMISE TO 
BLEND IN WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. THIS BRINGS A CHANCE OF SHOWERS

WEATHER FOR NEXT FEW DAYS WILL BE FAIRLY BENIGN WITH CLOUD COVER FOR 
A FEW HOURS THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO CU DEVELOPMENT AND RELATIVELY 
CLEAR SKIES AFTER THIS AS DRY AIR MAKES A SIGNIFICANT INTRUSION TO 
THE OHVLY FOR THURSDAY. 

DRY AIR SHOULD PERSIST ON FRIDAY AS WELL AS SOUTHERLY WINDS SET UP 
AHEAD OF SYSTEM IN THE PLAINS. MODELS START TO GO SOUTH ON EACH 
OTHER WITH APPROACH OF NEXT FRONT WITH THE GFS SIGNIFICANTLY QUICKER 
THAN THE ETA BEGINNING ON FRIDAY. ECMWF AND CANADIAN SUGGEST THE 
SLOWER TREND AWAY FROM THE GFS, AND IM ALL FOR PUTTING OFF WX UNTIL 
THE PM HOURS SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. FEEL THAT ITLL BE A BIT LATER 
AND WE SHOULD REMAIN DRY THROUGH 12Z SUNDAY. HOWEVER, DUE TO LARGE 
DISCREPANCIES IN MODELS, WILL KEEP CURRENT FCST WITH CHANCE POPS 
OVERNIGHT SAT AND NOT LET FLIP-FLOPPING PREVAIL. 

TEMPS SHOULD EXPERIENCE A SLIGHT INCREASE TODAY FROM YESTERDAY AND 
AGAIN ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. PM LOWS EXPECTED TO DROP TO THE CELLAR 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS DRIEST AIR IS OVERTOP OF FCST AREA. WILL LOWER 
READINGS HERE TO COME IN LINE WITH ETA GUIDANCE IN THE MID TO UPPER

LEAVE FOR ANOTHER RUN.

ALTHOUGH THERE DOESNT APPEAR TO BE ANY FORCING TO POP ANY SHOWERS

PREV DISCUSSION...
CLOUD COVER LOOKS TO BE ON A STEADY DECREASE THIS MORNING, BUT FEEL 
THAT ONCE THE SUN HITS THERE SHOULD BE SOME MIXING IN THE MID LEVELS 
FOR THE AC DECK TO GO BROKEN ONCE AGAIN. IT APPEARS THAT THERES 
ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR THIS TO OCCUR, AND THE WAY THEY BEGAN TO CLEAR 
WITH NIGHTFALL SUGGESTS A DIURNAL EFFECT.

CANT NOTICE MUCH OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN TODAY AND TOMORROW AS H8 
TEMPS AND THICKNESS APPEAR TO REMAIN FAIRLY STATIC. H5 HUMIDITY IS 
ON A NOTED DECREASE TOMORROW BUT THERES A CORRRESPONDING INCREASE 
IN LOWER H8 HUMIDITY TO COMPENSATE SO BOTH DAYS SHOULD BE A MOCLOUDY 
AFTERNOON WITH DIFFERENCE ONLY IN CLOUD HEIGHTS. HOWEVER, SUNSHINE 
IN THE EARLY AND LATER PARTS OF THE DAY MIGHT MAKE PARTLY CLOUDY 
MORE APPROPRIATE THAN MOSTLY CLOUDY.

WILL LOWER TEMPS OVERNIGHT WED TO ACCOUNT FOR DRY AIR THROUGH THE 
COLUMN AND SIGNIFICANT DECREASE IN DEWPOINTS ACROSS FCST AREA. 

H8 TEMPS AND A SIG DECREASE IN THICKNESS WOULD SUGGEST HIGHS IN THE 
UPPER 70S FOR THURSDAY SO ILL END UP CUTTING READINGS BY A DEGREE 
OR TWO ACROSS THE BOARD, BRINGING THEM TO AROUND 80. FULL SUNSHINE 
SHOULD MAKE UP SOME DIFFERENCE TO HELP BRING READINGS HIGHER THAN 
WHAT THICKNESS SUGGESTS. 

NEXT SYSTEM TO ENTER THE REGION ON SAT NIGHT/SUNDAY. MODELS HAVE 
BEEN SLOWING THE ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING FRONT, BUT I DONT WANT 
TO REMOVE PRECIP ENTIRELY ON SAT JUST TO HAVE NEXT RUN SWITCH BACK. 
SINCE THERES ONLY A LOW CHANCE POP LATER IN THE DAY WILL PASS ON 
CONCERN TO DAY SHIFT THAT IT MIGHT BE DRY UNTIL SUNDAY BUT LEAVE THE 
CHANCE FOR ONE MORE FORECAST PACKAGE. 

ASIDE FROM THIS, NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO FCST.

CURRENT WV/500 MB PROG INDCG UPR LO SPINNING ACRS TN VALLEY.  WDLY 
SCT LGT SHRA ACRS TN AND EASTERN KY INTO WEST VIRGINIA.  HAVE SEEN 
FEW ECHOES ACRS SE OH...BUT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE REACHING GROUND 
WITH CEILINGS GENERALLY AOA 10KFT AND VERY LITTLE MOISTURE IN LOWEST 
LVLS ATMOSPHERE.  PLENTY OF MID/HI LVL CLOUDS ACRS OH VALLEY 
ROTATING ARND UPR LO.

BIGGEST ISSUE IN SHORT TERM REVOLVES AROUND PCPN CHC AS UPR LO 
SLOWLY WEAKENS AND PULLS EAST AND WEAK BACK DOOR FRNT DROPS SOUTH 
FROM GRT LKS THRU TUES.  GFS IN PARTICULAR TRYING TO INDICATE SHRA 
DVLPMNT ACRS FCST AREA OVERNIGHT INTO TUES...BUT LITTLE MOISTURE AND 
NO CONVERGENCE BLO 700 MB.  WILL CONTINUE PREV FCST THINKING AND 
KEEP PCPN OUT OF FCST TONIGHT AND TUES.  MODEL SOUNDINGS INDCG 
ENHANCED MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM ACRS FCST AREA AT 500 MB 
AND ABOVE INTO TUES...AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEE GOOD AMOUNT OF 
AC/CS INTO TUES.

HI PRES ACRS QUEBEC WILL DRIFT SOUTH AND EAST INTO NEW ENGLAND BY 
WED MRNG...WITH SKIES CLEARING ACRS FCST AREA.  ALL MODELS INDCG UPR 
RIDGE TO REMAIN ACRS EASTERN CONUS INTO LATE WEEK AS TROF DIGS ACRS

TEMPS...STAYED CLOSE TO MAV GUID THRU WED NIGHT.  12Z GFS/ETA CAME

MATCHED UP WELL WITH MAV GUID.

EXTENDED...STRONG COLD FRNT WILL EJECT OUT INTO PLAINS FRI AND TRACK 
EAST INTO LWR GRT LKS/OH VALLEY ON SAT.  ALL MODELS NOW SLOWER WITH 
THIS FEATURE...AS UPR LVL FLOW BECOMES PARALLEL TO FRNTL BNDRY.

OVER THIS AREA...EXPECT CU TO DIMINISH AS MOISTURE SOURCE OVER LK 
HURON AND ERIE SHOULD BE CUT OFF. GIVEN THIS TREND IN THE BDRY LYR 
FLOW AND WIDESPREAD SUBSIDENCE...EXPECT SKIES TO CLEAR OUT OVERNIGHT.

MODELS OVERALL IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...AS HIGH

MAIN PROBLEM THROUGH THIS PERID WILL BE THE TEMPERATURE FORECASTS. 
MOST NOTABLY FOR THE HIGHS. TRENDS FOR THE ETA AND GFS THROUGH EARLY

FRONT AND THUS A BIT MORE MOIST...HAVE CHOOSEN TO KEEP MENTION OF

THEY WILL FALL MUCH MORE...WILL GO WITH STEADY WORDING.

BASED ON RADAR TRENDS...IT LOOKS LIKE THE HEAVIER RAINS WILL STAY 
ALONG OR SOUTH OF I-70 FOR TONIGHT...AND THE BACK EDGE OF THE RAIN 
COULD ACTUALLY PUSH INTO THE NORTHWEST OVERNIGHT.  MIGHT TAPER DOWN 
ON THE POPS IN THE NORTHWEST AFTER MINDIGHT.  WITH GROUND SO

SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT WARM FRONT IS APPROACHING I-70. 
THERE MAY BE A WEAK WAVE ALONG THE FRONT NEAR THE INDIANA/ILLINOIS 
BORDER WITH A STRONGER WAVE BACK IN MISSOURI.

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALREADY INTO THE WESTERN PORTION OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. EXPECT THE RAIN MODIFIED AIRMASS TO CAUSE THE 
BOUNDARY TO BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY. UPPER FORCING WILL MOVE 
PARALLEL TO THE FRONT. WITH PLENTY OF TROPICAL MOISTURE FEEDING INTO 
THE REGION THE STAGE IS SET FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH HEAVY RAINFALL PRIMARILY ALONG AND NORTH OF THE 
FRONT. 

HAVE ALREADY ISSUED A FLOOD WATCH FOR THAT PART OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. FOR NOW HAVE RUN IT THROUGH MIDNIGHT. BUT WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED IF IT HAS TO BE EXTENDED FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME AND 
POSSIBLY A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH. 

SOUTH OF THE FRONT EXPECT NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL 
ALTHOUGH THERE SHOULD BE PROLONGED RAIN FREE PERIODS AS WELL. COULD 
EVEN SEE SOME SUNSHINE ESPECIALLY IN KENTUCKY COUNTIES. THIS WOULD 
CAUSE A MARKED INCREASE IN INSTABILITY AND RESULT IN SEVERE WEATHER 
POTENTIAL.

THE FRONT WILL SAG SOUTHWARD LATE TONIGHT BEHIND A LOW THAT WILL MOVE
ACROSS THE AREA. THIS WILL CAUSE THE ZONE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO SHIFT TO THE SOUTH. LATEST GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT 
THE FRONT WILL GET HUNG UP AGAIN IN THE SOUTHERN ZONES SO THERE WILL 
BE A CONTINUED THREAT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO WEDNESDAY. 
EXPECT THE CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION TO COME TO AND END WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT SWEEP ACROSS THE REGION FROM THE NORTHWEST.

WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RAINFALL.

THERE MAY BE SEVERAL PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. ALTHOUGH

INCREASE AS THE FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST LATE IN THE DAY.

WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT THIS MORNING HELPING TO PRODUCE A FEW AC ACROSS

ENOUGH TODAY TO KEEP SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY MOST AREAS. WARM 
TEMPERATURES FORECAST TO REMAIN IN PLACE IN THE LOW LEVELS TODAY 
AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING GOOD CAP SO WILL CUT BACK ON POPS FOR 
TODAY ACROSS THE NORTH AND ONLY KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS THE

THAT SOME OF THE ACTIVITY MAY DRIFT SOUTHEAST AND DOWN INTO SOME OF

WITH HIGH LOW LEVEL TEMPS KEEPING AMS FAIRLY WELL CAPPED SO WILL

LIKELY TO DRIFT INTO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF FA THIS MORNING. 
HOWEVER...THINK THAT ONCE THE SUN HITS IT THIS MORNING IT SHOULD 
EVAPORATE AND SOUNDINGS NOT SHOWING MUCH IN THE WAY OF CU THIS 
AFTERNOON SO MOSTLY SUNNY LOOKS GOOD FOR TODAY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR 
ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY ACROSS THE AREA WITH HIGHS JUST A TAD WARMER 
THAN YESTERDAY...GENERALLY STILL IN THE LOWER 80S. 

MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT IN TRYING TO BREAK DOWN RIDGE THROUGH 
THE FIRST PART OF THE WORK WEEK WITH FLOW ALOFT BECOMING MORE ZONAL. 
WEAK BOUNDARY FORECAST TO DROP DOWN INTO AREA DURING THE DAY ON 
MONDAY. GFS LOOKS TO BE OVERDONE WITH S/W THOUGH ON MONDAY AND 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING A DECENT CAP...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE 
SOUTH. WILL JUST INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS THE WAPOK GROUP FOR 
MONDAY WHERE A LITTLE BETTER 9H/8H CONVERGENCE PRESENT. LOOKS LIKE 
BOUNDARY THEN TRIES TO LAY OUT ACROSS OUR NORTH FOR TUESDAY INTO WED 
WITH WEAK DISTURBANCES PASSING ACROSS ALOFT SO WILL GO WITH LOW 
CHANCE OF POPS BOTH DAYS. 

ETA STILL LOOKS TO BE TOO WARM ON MONDAY...TAKING 8H TEMPS UP INTO 
THE LOWER 20S AND WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME DEBRIS CLOUDS 
SPILLING INTO AREA FROM POSSIBLE CONVECTION TO OUR NORTH...WILL KEEP 
HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S. WILL THEN ALLOW FOR ABOUT A CATEGORY

UPPER HIGH DUE TO CROSS AREA TODAY.  TROF MOVING INTO GREAT LAKES 
WILL BEGIN TO INFLUENCE OUR WEATHER BY LATE THURSDAY.  TROF IS 
PROGGED TO PROGRESS TO THE EAST COAST BY SUNDAY...WITH ANOTHER RIDGE 
MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY EARLY NEXT WEEK.

SURFACE HIGH ALONG THE EAST COAST WILL GIVE US ONE MORE DRY DAY 
TODAY.  FRONT APPROACHING ON THURSDAY WILL BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
TSRA DURING THE AFTERNOON. MODEL CAPES ABOVE 2000 J/KG WILL WARRANT 
ADDING POPS TO CVG AREA...WHILE KEEPING POPS AT DAY AND CMH.  ILL 
KEEP SOUTHEAST COUNTIES DRY FOR NOW WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATING 
A STRONG CAP AT 10 KFT.  

MODELS HAVE SLOWED FRONTS PROGRESS WITH RESPECT TO PREVIOUS RUNS.  
THEREFORE...THE CHANCE OF TSRA WILL PERSIST THROUGH FRIDAY.  AFTER 
THE FRONT AND UPPER TROF MOVE EAST...HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR 
WILL MOVE DOWN HERE ON SATURDAY IN THE NORTHWEST UPPER FLOW.

TEMPS:  WE STRUGGLED TO REACH THE MID 80S YESTERDAY...SO IVE 
DECIDED TO LOWER DAYTIME READINGS BY A COUPLE DEGREES FOR TODAY.  
IVE ALSO ADJUSTED THURSDAYS HIGHS...MAKING THEM A BIT COOLER IN 
WEST CENTRAL OHIO WHERE I EXPECT MORE CLOUDS TO MOVE IN.

HIGH PRESSURE AT SURFACE RESIDES FROM THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THE

THERES LITTLE MOISTURE AROUND TODAY...SO SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY

IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES ON WEDNESDAY SO I 
EXPECT SKIES WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY NEAR THE OHIO RIVER...WITH

LIKELY PRECLUDE ANY DEEP CONVECTION.  CHANCE TSRA STILL LOOKS GOOD 
FOR THURSDAY WITH CONVECTION POSSIBLY BREAKING OUT AHEAD OF THE

VISIBLE IMAGERY AND KILN RADAR THIS AFTN WERE SHOWING DEVELOPING 
CONVECTION...MAINLY FROM THE CVG AREA NE TO CMH.  THIS WAS IN 
RESPONSE TO A WEAK SFC TROF...COMBINED WITH CAPES BETWEEN 2500 J/KG 
AND 3000 J/KG.  ATTM...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY DEPICTED A S/WV OVER SRN 
WISCONSIN/NRN IL.  THIS S/WV SHOULD KEPT CONVECTION GOING INTO THE 
EVENING HOURS N AND INTO EARLY MORNING S AS IT MOVES FROM NW TO SE 
OVER THE CWFA.  ONCE THIS PASSES AND CONVECTION CEASES...SKIES 
SHOULD BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR.  VERY HUMID AIRMASS WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
THE LOWER TO MID 70S...WITH LIGHT WINDS AND LEFT OVER MSTR FROM 
RAINFALL WILL RESULT IN AREAS OF FOG...LOCALLY DENSE.  
EVENING/MIDNIGHT SHIFT WILL HAVE TO ASCERTAIN IF AN ADVISORY SHOULD 
BE NEEDED.

FOR SATURDAY...COLD FRONT OVER THE NRN PLAINS WILL SWEEP SOUTHEAST 
INTO THE SRN GREAT LAKES BY AFTN...THEN ACRS OUR CWFA INTO THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY BY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING.  ONLY WEAK 
CONVERGENCE NOTED ON MODELS IN THE LOW LVLS.  BEST UPR DYNAMICS WILL 
BE FOCUSED MORE TOWARDS NE OHIO.  HOWEVER...WITH FCST CAPES OF 
NEARLY 3000 J/KG...IT WILL NOT TAKE MUCH TO KICK OFF A SCATTERED 
LINE OF CONVECTION (PSBLY A SQUALL LINE).  50 POPS FOR THE ENTIRE 
REGION STILL LOOK GOOD AT THIS TIME.

MORE OF THE SAME WITH HOT MUGGY CONDITIONS EXPECTED UNTIL FROPA ON 
SATURDAY. ISOLD TO SCT AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING CONVECTION EXPECTED 
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. WITHOUT ANY TRIGGER ASIDE FROM VORT AND VERY 
WEAK S/W MOVING THROUGH CENTRAL OH...AND THE HIGH CENTERED RIGHT 
OVER FCST AREA...CANT RULE OUT POPUPS IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA.

COLD FROPA SAT NITE AND SUN HAS MUCH OF FCST AREA INTO A PLEASANT 
AIRMASS WITH COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPS ON A GOOD NE FLOW. INCREASED 
CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION SATURDAY WITH BEST MOISTURE FOUND IN ERN 
FCST AREA. HAVE CHANCE POPS IN FOR ALL AREAS DUE TO FROPA MOVING 
INTO A HIGH AREA OF PWATS. 

ON THE EXTENDED, MOST MODEL SOLUTIONS WITH EXCEPTION OF GFS ARE 
TRYING TO PUSH H5 TROF OVER THE EAST COAST BETWEEN 12Z TUE AND 0Z 
WED. AFTER THIS, THEY BRING IN SFC HIGH PRESSURE AND A RETURN TO SLY 
FLOW FOR THE OHVLY. GFS HOLDS UP ON THE TROF AND NEVER QUITE PUSHES 
IT PAST THE WESTERN SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS. THE SFC HIGH FROM 
THIS SOLUTION PASSES N OF FCST AREA THROUGH GTLKS RGN AND AN 
INVERTED TROF SETS UP OVER ERN FCST AREA. I EXPECT THAT THE GFS WILL 
COME INTO LINE HERE BUT CONFIDENCE DROPS SIGNIFICANTLY STARTING ON 
TUES.

WILL WORK THE LAST 2 DAYS OF THE FCST AS SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
(MAINLY TO THE EAST) PARTLY CLOUDY AND ON THE WARM SIDE. IF OTHER

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES UPPER LOW DRIFTING SW TOWARDS MID MS 
VLY.  SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS LIGHT FLOW OVER REGION.  SATELLITE 
IMAGERY INDICATES MO CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVER FA.

MODELS ARE IN DESCENT AGREEMENT WITH TAKING UPPER LOW TO THE SW 
ALLOWING RIDGE TO STRENGTHEN OVER EASTERN CONUS.  THIS AFT/EVE WILL 
BE THE LAST DAY WITH DESCENT COVERAGE OF CONVECTION OVER THE REGION. 
THINK BEST THREAT WILL BE NORTH OF I-70 WHERE UPPER TROF AND MID 
LEVEL ENERGY WILL ALLOW FOR A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE.  UPPER RIDGE 
WILL BE WEAKEST OVER FA THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  MODELS ALSO INDICATE 
WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY IN THE REGION.  THINK ISOLATED (10-20%) IS 
POSSIBLE LATE AFT/EVE ON WED.  WILL KEEP CURRENT MENTION IN ZONES 
FOR WED.  WILL HOLD OFF ON THU WITH UPPER RIDGE EXPECTED TO BE A BIT 
STRONGER.  IF ANYTHING GOES IT SHOULD BE LESS THAN 10%.

MAV TEMPS LOOK GOOD.  THE ONLY ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE TO BUMP UP A

OHIO VALLEY REGION WITH MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS.

KILN RADAR HAS SHOWN A DECREASE IN THE COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND

OF DAYTIME HEATING AND LACK OF ANY SYNOPTIC SCALE LOW LEVEL 
FORCING.  HOWEVER...A FEW RENEGADE SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER THE PAST

DIFFUSE SURFACE PATTERN HAS WEAK LOW OVER SOUTHEASTERN CONUS WITH A

THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA LATE SATURDAY...WITH ETA BEING SLOWER AND 
FARTHER EAST.  THE LOW IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE TO NEW

TROF...SCATTERED TSRA HAVE DEVELOPED AGAIN TODAY.  AS IN PREVIOUS 
DAYS...THESE TSRA WILL DIE OUT AFTER DARK.  WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN 
AIRMASS...I EXPECT THE SAME SITUATION ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.  

ON SATURDAY...SURFACE LOW MOVING THROUGH PENNSYLVANIA WILL ENHANCE

WESTERN ZONES FARTHER FROM THE SURFACE FORCING.  VORT MAX IS 
FORECAST TO DROP INTO OHIO ON SUNDAY.  HOWEVER...DUE TO THE LACK OF 
SURFACE FORCING...20 POPS WILL WORK ACROSS OUR ENTIRE AREA ON SUNDAY.

NOT A WHOLE LOT OF FORCING ACROSS AREA THIS AFTERNOON BUT STILL A

SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS. THESE ARE ROTATING SLOWLY SOUTHEAST AND  
EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE UNTIL WE LOSE THE DIURNAL HEATING.

POP ACROSS ENTIRE AREA THROUGH THIS EVENING. 

WEAK INSTABILITY AGAIN PROGGED ACROSS THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY WITH 
BOTH THE ETA AND GFS SHOWING A S/W DROPPING DOWN ACROSS INDIANA AND 
INTO KENTUCKY WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY EVENING. THIS MAY BE ENOUGH 
TO KICK OFF A FEW MORE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. WILL GENERALLY GO WITH A 20 POP BUT 
WILL GO A LITTLE HIGHER ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST WITH A LITTLE BETTER 
FORCING. 

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THEN FORECAST TO REMAIN PRETTY MUCH IN PLACE

DROPPING DOWN ACROSS AREA FROM TIME TO TIME. SINCE THEY WILL BE 
DIFFICULT TO TIME AND FAIRLY WEAK...WILL KEEP POPS GENERALLY IN THE

AM UNCERTAIN WITH FOG POTENTIAL BOTH THIS MORNING AND TOMORROW. 
LOOKING UPSTREAM IN THE WAKE OF THE H5 TROF, THERE WAS LITTLE FOG 
YESTERDAY OVER IA/WI/IL AND I HAVE DOUBTS THAT WELL END UP WITH 
WIDESPREAD ADVISORY CRITERIA. WILL WORD AS AREAS OF FOG THAT ARE 
LOCALLY DENSE WITH THE WORST IN THE TYPICAL FOG-PRONE HILLS AND 
RIVER VALLEYS. DRIER AIR NOTED AT 12Z TOMORROW...SO MAYBE FOG WONT 
BE AN ISSUE HERE BUT I DOUBT IT. WILL STILL MENTION IT SINCE THERE 
HAS BEEN ENOUGH PREICP OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS AND THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA IS STILL QUITE DAMP. 

CLOUD COVER TODAY SHOULD BE FAIRLY EXTENSIVE IN THE EASTERN 1/2 OF 
FCST AREA AS THIS IS THE LEADING EDGE OF THE COOLEST H8 AIR. AM 
CONCERNED THAT MOCLOUDY MIGHT BE THE CHARACTERISTIC IN THE WEST AS 
WELL...BUT WILL STAY SLIGHTLY MORE OPTIMISTIC. FLY IN THE OINTMENT 
HERE MIGHT BE A LLVL STRATUS EARLY DUE TO THE LIFTING OF ANY FOG.  
NEUTRAL TEMPERATURE ADVECTION AT H8 IN STORE FOR WED WITH A SLIGHT 
DIURNAL MODIFICATION EXPECTED. 

HAVE CUT TEMPS BY A FEW DEGREES ACROSS THE BOARD TODAY WITH EXPECTED 
MORNING FOG AND AFTERNOON CLOUD COVER. GENERALLY WENT UPPER 70S 
EVERYWHERE MINUS A FEW COUNTIES BORDERING SDF WHERE LOWER 80S ARE 
POSSIBLE. TONIGHT SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO THIS MORNING AND I WILL ALSO 
LOWER MOST PM LOWS BY A DEGREE OR TWO TO AROUND 60 OR LOWER 60S IN 
MOST AREAS. 

NOT MUCH OF A CHANGE IN THE FCST ASIDE FROM A GENERALLY LOWERING OF 
PREVIOUS FCST TEMPS. ISOLATED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN 
POSSIBLE THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY AND SHOULD BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN 
WITH A LATE DAY OCCURRENCE IF THEY APPEAR. DONT PARTICULARLY AGREE

UPDATED TO REMOVE WATCH FROM REST OF CWA THIS MORNING.

CURRENT RADAR TRENDS SHOW STRONG RETURNS WITH A BOWING SEGMENT 
DIRECTLY UNDER A FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED VORT CENTER IN SE ILL. THIS 
VORT IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE A LEFT TURN WHICH IS EVIDENT ON BOTH 
RADAR AND SATELLITE LOOP. MESOETA SHOWING THE VORT WEAKENING AS IT 
UNDERCUTS THE AXIS OF THE H5 TROF SO THESE RETURNS SHOULD WEAKEN 
EARLY THIS MORNING. ANOTHER VORT ASSOCIATED WITH THE MORE WIDESPREAD 
PRECIP OVER LVXS AREA IS PROGGED TO BE OVER THE TRI-STATE AND MOVE 
TOWARDS NW OH THIS MORNING. MAIN AREA OF PRECIP IS ON THE SOUTHERN 
END OF THIS VORT AND SHOULD ALSO DECREASE AS THE VORT MOVES AWAY 
FROM THE LLVL CONVERGENCE AND AREA OF BEST MEAN LIFT. HOWEVER...THE 
COMBINATION OF THE TWO VORTS COULD SPARK THE MCS NOTED ON THE GFS 
SOLUTION BUT I THINK THAT A MORE WIDESPREAD EVENT WITH LOWER MAX 
PRECIP VALUES IS ON STORE FOR MUCH OF THE CWA EARLY THIS MORNING. 

AFTER THE EARLY RAIN...MODELS DRY SLOT CWA AND SHOW LITTLE PRECIP 
WITH EXCEPTION OF THE GFS. 

THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST UNSETTLED PATTERN WITH LARGE GAPS IN MODEL 
SOLUTIONS DUE TO PLACEMENT/STRENGTH/TIMING OF S/WS SWINGING AROUND 
STUBBORN H5 LOW. THOUGH MODELS AND TRENDS SUGGEST DRY PUNCHES 
BETWEEN THESE WAVES, I CANT REMOVE POPS IN ANY PARTICULAR PERIOD, 
THOUGH THE CHARACTERISTIC OF THE WX WONT BE ALL RAIN. THREAT FOR

UPDATED TO REMOVE WATCH FROM REST OF CWA THIS MORNING.

CURRENT RADAR TRENDS SHOW STRONG RETURNS WITH A BOWING SEGMENT 
DIRECTLY UNDER A FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED VORT CENTER IN SE ILL. THIS 
VORT IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE A LEFT TURN WHICH IS EVIDENT ON BOTH 
RADAR AND SATELLITE LOOP. MESOETA SHOWING THE VORT WEAKENING AS IT 
UNDERCUTS THE AXIS OF THE H5 TROF SO THESE RETURNS SHOULD WEAKEN 
EARLY THIS MORNING. ANOTHER VORT ASSOCIATED WITH THE MORE WIDESPREAD 
PRECIP OVER LVXS AREA IS PROGGED TO BE OVER THE TRI-STATE AND MOVE 
TOWARDS NW OH THIS MORNING. MAIN AREA OF PRECIP IS ON THE SOUTHERN 
END OF THIS VORT AND SHOULD ALSO DECREASE AS THE VORT MOVES AWAY 
FROM THE LLVL CONVERGENCE AND AREA OF BEST MEAN LIFT. HOWEVER...THE 
COMBINATION OF THE TWO VORTS COULD SPARK THE MCS NOTED ON THE GFS 
SOLUTION BUT I THINK THAT A MORE WIDESPREAD EVENT WITH LOWER MAX 
PRECIP VALUES IS ON STORE FOR MUCH OF THE CWA EARLY THIS MORNING. 

AFTER THE EARLY RAIN...MODELS DRY SLOT CWA AND SHOW LITTLE PRECIP

WITH MAIN BNDRY POSITIONED ACROSS CENTRAL KY.  ISOLATED SHOWERS WERE 
OCCURRING IN THE FAR SW AND SE...WITH A FEW STRIKES JUST SW OF FCST 
AREA IN NW KY.  

TODAY...THE BNDRY PUSHES NE AS A S/W MOVES ACROSS THE AREA.  
ALTHOUGH THE ETA HAS NOT BEEN THAT CONSISTENT WITH THIS SCENARIO 
OVER THE LAST FEW RUNS...IT HAS BEEN MORE ACCURATE THAN THE GFS.  
THE ETA SHOWS A SHARPER AXIS OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE IN THE EASTERN 
FCST AREA WHILE THE GFS IS MORE SPREAD OUT TO THE WEST AND WEAKER 
WITH THIS FEATURE AS WELL.  ETA CAPES RANGE FROM 500-1200 J/KG THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES AGAIN IN THE SE WHERE NEAR 70 
DEW POINTS ARE BEING ADVECTED IN WITH THE BNDRY.  WITH THIS IN 
MIND...WILL RESTRICT THE NW THIRD OF FCST AREA TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
TODAY.  TONIGHT...WILL MENTION MAINLY EVENING WORDING FOR ZONES AS 
THE S/W MOVES OFF TO THE EAST.

WILL CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE FCST AREA FRIDAY.  NOT MUCH 
FORCING...BUT PROGGED ETA CAPES ARE 1500-2300 J/KG ALONG WITH THE 
UPPER LOW TO NW MOVING CLOSER TO THE FCST AREA.  ANOTHER S/W ROTATES 
AROUND THE UPPER LOW FRIDAY NIGHT...INCREASING THE POPS.

NO CHANGES TO EXTENDED...AS A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES ROTATE AROUND 
UPPER LOW TO NORTH FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  FCST TEMPS GENERALLY A 
BIT COOLER THAN GUIDANCE LOOKS FINE AS WELL.

AN INVERTED TROF EXTENDED INTO THE SOUTHERN FCST AREA THIS MORNING 
WITH MAIN BNDRY POSITIONED ACROSS CENTRAL KY.  ISOLATED SHOWERS WERE 
OCCURRING IN THE FAR SW AND SE...WITH A FEW STRIKES JUST SW OF FCST 
AREA IN NW KY.  

TODAY...THE BNDRY PUSHES NE AS A S/W MOVES ACROSS THE AREA.  
ALTHOUGH THE ETA HAS NOT BEEN THAT CONSISTENT WITH THIS SCENARIO 
OVER THE LAST FEW RUNS...IT HAS BEEN MORE ACCURATE THAN THE GFS.  
THE ETA SHOWS A SHARPER AXIS OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE IN THE EASTERN 
FCST AREA WHILE THE GFS IS MORE SPREAD OUT TO THE WEST AND WEAKER 
WITH THIS FEATURE AS WELL.  ETA CAPES RANGE FROM 500-1200 J/KG THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES AGAIN IN THE SE WHERE NEAR 70 
DEW POINTS ARE BEING ADVECTED IN WITH THE BNDRY.  WITH THIS IN 
MIND...WILL RESTRICT THE NW THIRD OF FCST AREA TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
TODAY.  TONIGHT...WILL MENTION MAINLY EVENING WORDING FOR ZONES AS 
THE S/W MOVES OFF TO THE EAST.

WILL CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE FCST AREA FRIDAY.  NOT MUCH 
FORCING...BUT PROGGED ETA CAPES ARE 1500-2300 J/KG ALONG WITH THE 
UPPER LOW TO NW MOVING CLOSER TO THE FCST AREA.  ANOTHER S/W ROTATES 
AROUND THE UPPER LOW FRIDAY NIGHT...INCREASING THE POPS.

NO CHANGES TO EXTENDED...AS A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES ROTATE AROUND 
UPPER LOW TO NORTH FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  FCST TEMPS GENERALLY A 
BIT COOLER THAN GUIDANCE LOOKS FINE AS WELL.

.ILN...NONE.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWING WEAK INVERTED TROF EXTENDING UP 
ALONG THE UPPER OHIO RIVER. AIRMASS SIGHTLY UNSTABLE ACROSS AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON BUT SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATING BEST CU DEVELOPMENT 
GENERALLY ALONG AND TO THE EAST/SOUTHEAST OF INVERTED TROF. THINK 
THIS AREA WOULD BE MOST FAVORABLE FOR ANY ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON AND THUS THINK OUR FA WILL REMAIN DRY THROUGH LATE 
AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING. 

MEANWHILE...WEAK BOUNDARY EXTENDING FROM ARKANSAS EAST INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY IS FORECAST TO LIFT NORTH OVERNIGHT. THE ETA IS 
MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS THAN THE GFS...BRINGING PCPN UP INTO THE 
SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF FA LATER TONIGHT. BASED ON CURRENT ACTIVITY... 
THINK ETA MAY BE A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE SO WILL JUST HANG ON TO 
CURRENT 20 POP FOR THE SOUTH FOR LATE TONIGHT. BOTH ETA/GFS SHOWING 
AXIS OF DEEPER MOISTURE SHIFTING EAST NORTHEAST ACROSS EASTERN OHIO 
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON WITH WEAK S/W ENERGY LIFTING UP ACROSS 
THE AREA. DEWPOINTS SHOULD MAKE IT UP INTO THE UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON WHICH WOULD RESULT IN SBCAPES IN THE 1000-1500 
J/KG RANGE. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE 
BEST COVERAGE ACROSS OUR EAST AND SOUTHEAST. 

UPPER LEVEL LOW THEN FORECAST TO SLOWLY DROP DOWN INTO THE GREAT 
LAKES THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH MUCH OF NEXT 
WEEK. LOOKS LIKE A BIT OF A DRY SLOT ACROSS THE AREA FOR FRIDAY SO 
WILL ONLY GO WITH A 20 TO 30 POP BUT THEN ETA AND GFS BOTH 
INDICATING A S/W ROTATING INTO THE AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY SO WILL BUMP POPS UP A LITTLE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY. AFTER THAT...TIMING OF ANY S/WS AROUND THE UPPER LOW IS 
DIFFICULT AND WILL GENERALLY BROAD BRUSH LOW CHANCE POPS THROUGH 
TUESDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCE DURING THE DIURNALLY FAVORABLE TIMES 
FROM ABOUT 20Z THROUGH 02Z. HAVE LEFT WEDNESDAY DRY FOR NOW BUT IF 
UPPER LEVEL LOW/TROF LINGERS THROUGH WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY AS SHOWN BY 
00Z GFS...WILL PROBABLY EVENTUALLY HAVE TO ADD A CHANCE FOR THEN TOO.

AS FOR TEMPS...TRENDED COOLER THAN GUID...ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED WITH LOWER HEIGHTS ACROSS THE AREA.

BDRY LYR TROUGH CURRENTLY EXTENDING NE INTO WV EXPECTED TO PIVIT 
SLOWLY NW DURING THE DAY. EXPECT AT MOST ISOLATED CONVECTION TO 
DEVELOP WITHIN THIS TROUGH AXIS LATER TDY. WITH OVERALL FORCING 
RATHER NEGLIGABLE IN OUR AREA...FEEL CONVECTIVE TEMP WILL NEED TO BE 
MET FOR ANY DEVELOPMENT. BEST LOCATION IN OUR AREA FOR THIS WILL BE 
EXTREME SE PORTION OF ILN FA. SO THE 10 POPS IN THE CURRENT GRIDS

SHORT TERM FORECAST IS DRY THROUGH WED NIGHT WITH SFC HIGH PRESSURE 
EXITING THE REGION. AM UNCONVINCED THAT ANY PRECIP WILL GET IN 
BEFORE THURS MORNING. HAVE PUT IN SLIGHT CHANCE TO COVER UNCERTAINTY 
FOR WED NIGHT. TEMPS WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER TONIGHT THAN LAST 
NIGHT...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SOUTH WHICH MIGHT BE SLIGHTLY 
COOLER AS THEY HAD CLOUDS LINGER AND THE FROPA LATER. SUNNY SKIES 
EXPECTED THROUGH THIS TIME AS WELL SO DAYTIME HIGHS WILL MODIFY 
SLIGHTLY WARMER EACH DAY. 

LOOKS LIKE THE 0Z OPERATIONAL RUN OF THE GFS IS THE ONLY ONE OF THE 
ENSEMBLES THAT STRENGTHENS THE SFC LOW AT 12Z THURS TO PRODUCE 
PRECIP IN THE OHVLY. OTHERS HAD THE SFC WAVE A GOOD BIT FURTHER 
SOUTHWEST. LOOKING AT THE ETA AT THIS TIME, IT ALSO SHOWS A WAVE BUT 
IS CONSIDERABLY WEAKER AND FURTHER SSW. IN EITHER CASE, THEY APPEAR 
TO BE BREAKING DOWN THE SFC RIDGE A BIT QUICKLY AND MERGE THE 
1000-500 MOISTURE FIELDS WITH THE SFC LOW OVER THE GTLKS AS THE 
SMALL H5 RIDGE MOVES EAST EARLY ON THURS. WITH THE H5 S/W DEEPENING 
OVER FCST AREA EARLY THURS, MODELS ARE SHOWING INCREASED SBCAPES AND 
HAVE NEG LIS OVER ERN FCST AREA FROM 12Z-18Z. TRW SHOULD DEVELOP 
EARLY WITH DAYTIME HEATING, SO CHANCE POPS EVERYWHERE THURS 
BEGINNING IN THE A.M. 

UNSETTLED WEATHER FOR THE MID FEW DAYS OF FCST AS H5 LOW DROPS 
SLOWLY SE AND MOVES THROUGH THE GTLKS REGION. MEAN AXIS OF TROF 
PASSES CWA AT 12Z SUNDAY PER GFS AND SO DOES THE SFC FRONT. THINGS 
SHOULD BE DRY STARTING ON SUNDAY WITH SOME LINGERING SHOWERS 
POSSIBLE IN THE SOUTH EARLY IN THE DAY. MON AFTERNOON IS SHOWING 
SOME COLD POOL SHOWERS IN THE NORTHWEST BUT IM LEAVING THIS DRY FOR 
NOW. IF SOME LIFTING MECHANISM ISNT THERE THESE WONT BE REALIZED 
SO THE FCST AFTER SUNDAY WILL BE DRY...COOL...AND PROBABLY MOCLOUDY 
AS H8 COLD POOL IS SHOWING LITTLE MODIFICATION AS THE H5 LOW IS 
STILL IN FAIRLY CLOSE PROXIMITY. BELIEVE THAT OVERNIGHT PERIODS HERE 
WOULD CLEAR OUT FOR ALL BUT THE NORTHEAST DUE TO PROXIMITY OF H5 LOW 
AND COLD POOL.

FOR EARLY TOMORROW AS WELL WITH H5 VORT AND LLVL MOISTURE. DID NOT 
THINK THAT THE TWO WOULD COMBINE TO MAKE ANY REAL CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
BUT WILL PASS ON TO NEXT SHIFT FOR EARLY TOMORROW.

ALONG IT. A LARGER CLUSTER OF STORMS WAS MOVING OUT OF SOUTHERN 
INDIANA AND SHOULD CONTINUE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE

POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA.

EXPECT MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION TO BE OVER BY THIS EVENING ALTHOUGH 
SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD STILL HANG ON IN FAR SOUTHERN 
ZONES BEFORE FINALLY PUSHING OFF TO THE SOUTH AND EAST.

DRIER AIR WILL COME IN FOR TUESDAY. BUT BY WEDNESDAY MODELS ARE

OVERRUNNING ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT ALTHOUGH THE BETTER CHANCE FOR

SLIDING SOUTHWARD.  KILN INDICATING CONVECTION ALONG PRE-FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY OVER NRN OH AND NRN INDIAN.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES 
MAINLY CLEAR SKIES AHEAD OF CONVECTION.

MODELS ARE GENERALLY IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SLOWLY SLIDING FRONT 
SOUTHWARD ACROSS FA.  TIMING DIFFERENCES CENTER ON TIMING OF  
PERTEBATIONS.  CONCERNED MAINLY ABOUT FLOODING AND WIND THREAT.  
ATMOSPHERE IS MODERATELY UNSTABLE AHEAD OF CONVECTION.  MEAN FLOW IS 
RATHER LIGHT AND UNIDIRECTIONAL ALLOWING BACK BUILDING AND SLOW

POSSIBLY ISSUE A WATCH.  BOTH MODELS ARE TRYING TO INDICATE

MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO TODAYS FORECAST. HAVE PULLED POPS OUT THROUGH

DECENT SWLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND SHOWERS SHOULD START POPPING 
LATER THIS AFTERNOON, ALTHOUGH AN ORGANIZED LINE SHOULDNT BE 
APPARENT UNTIL THE FRONT STARTS KICKING UP NORTH OF THE FCST AREA. 

PRIMARY CONCERN WITH THE PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT WILL BE

MODEL MASS FIELDS ACTUALLY IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT TODAY. ETA 
IS STILL A BIT SLOWER WITH THE SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF THE FRONT. 
PREFERRED THIS IDEA ALTHOUGH WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE A WIND 
SHIFT/OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FURTHER SOUTH AT SOME POINT CLOSER TO THE GFS 
POSITION. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN WHERE AND WHEN THE MODELS 
GENERATE CONVECTION.

FOR TODAY EXPECT SCATTERED SHOWERS BRUSHING BY NORTHERN TIER TO 
DIMINISH EARLY THIS MORNING. BUT THEN COULD START SEEING SOME 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS APPROACHING THE FAR NORTHERN ZONES TOWARDS 
MIDDAY. CONVERGENCE IS NOT THAT GREAT ALONG THE FRONT AND IT WILL 
TAKE SOME TIME FOR CAP TO ERODE. WILL KEEP COVERAGE SCATTERED FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON. BUT THIS SHOULD BECOME GREATER INTO THE NIGHT. 
LIKELY PROBABILITIES STILL LOOK REASONABLE FOR MOST AREAS TONIGHT.

THERE WILL BE PRETTY GOOD INSTABILITY TODAY AND PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES WILL CLIMB TO AROUND 2 INCHES. HAIL THREAT LOOKS MINIMAL BUT 
THERE COULD BE SOME DAMAGING WINDS IN WET DOWNBURSTS. THERE IS THE 
POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING WITH TRAINING ECHOES AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO MENTION HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT.

BOUNDARY WILL STILL BE IN FAR SOUTHERN ZONES ON MONDAY SO WILL KEEP 
LIKELY PROBABILITIES GOING THERE. BUT THERE SHOULD BE A FAIRLY SHARP 
NORTHERN EDGE TO ANY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. SO EXPECT NORTHERN 
ZONES TO START DRYING OUT AS FAR AS PRECIPITATION CHANCES. THE 
CHANCE OF RAIN SHOULD END IN THE SOUTH ON MONDAY NIGHT AS FRONT GETS 
PUSHED FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST BY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN. 

GUIDANCE HIGH TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN RUNNING A LITTLE WARM THE PAST 
FEW DAYS. BUT MODEL THICKNESS FORECASTS SUGGESTS THAT READINGS 
SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. THIS PUT TEMPERATURES 
AROUND GUIDANCE. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS FOR TONIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. BUT THOUGHT IT MIGHT BE A LITTLE COOLER BY 
TUESDAY.

UPPER RIDGE STRETCHING ACROSS THE AREA WILL GRADUALLY GET SUPPRESSED 
AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVES THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND HELPS DEEPEN 
THE TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA. GENERALLY PREFERRED TO GO WITH 
SLOWER FRONTAL MOVEMENT. THIS WOULD BE THE ETA EARLY ON AND THEN 
CLOSER TO THE GFS IN LATER PERIODS. HOWEVER STRONG WAVES ALONG THE 
FRONT DEPICTED BY THE GFS ARE HIGHLY SUSPECT.

SO WILL CONTINUE WITH DRY FORECAST THROUGH TONIGHT WITH MAINLY HIGH 
CLOUDS TO DEAL WITH. WILL THEN BRING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN 
FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ON SUNDAY AS FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA. LOOKS 
LIKE PRETTY GOOD INSTABILITY WITH CAPE FROM 1500 TO 2000 AND 
PRECIPITABLE WATER RISING TO AROUND 2 INCHES. HOWEVER SHEAR IS NOT 
THAT GREAT. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT. HAVE BUMPED PROBABILITY UP TO LIKELY BY THEN AND WILL 
MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY RAIN. WILL CONTINUE CHANCE ON 
MONDAY WITH HIGHEST PROBABILITY IN THE SOUTH AND THEN TRY TO END 
PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY NIGHT.

EXPECT HIGHS TO BE IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S TODAY WITH LITTLE 
DIFFERENCE IN READINGS FOR TOMORROW AS MOST PLACES SHOULD HAVE AMPLE 
TIME TO WARM UP BEFORE CONVECTION GETS GOING. NIGHTS SHOULD BE WARM 
WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO

NO MAJOR CHANGES TO FCST TODAY. HAVE ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE WORDING IN 
THE SOUTHEAST AND EAST DURING TIME OF MAX HEATING THIS AFTERNOON. 
THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THERMAL AXIS STILL IN THIS AREA DURING THIS 
TIME AND A SLIGHT HINT FROM THE ETA THAT THERES A WEAK LOBE OF 
INCREASED VORTICITY BEHIND THE MEAN H5 TROF. HAVE LOWERED 
TEMPERATURES IN THE SOUTHEAST FROM AROUND 80 TO THE UPPER 70S AND 
HAVE SHIFTED THE AROUND 80 WORDING TO THE WEST INSTEAD WHERE MORE 
SUN IS EXPECTED ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE H8 COLD POOL. 

DEWPOINTS DROP INTO THE 50S TONIGHT AND LOW TEMPS SHOULD APPROACH 
THEM IN THE EAST...AROUND 60 OR LOW 60S IN THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST. 
HAVE COME UP A FEW DEGREES FOR HIGHS ON FRIDAY TO COME IN LINE WITH 
SURROUNDING OFFICES...GENERALLY MID 80S WITH SOME LOWER 80S IN THE 
NORTH. PM LOWS FRIDAY WERE DROPED BY A FEW DEGREES ACROSS THE BOARD 
AS MODEL GUIDANCE IS SHOWING CLEAR SKIES AND A RELATIVE MIN ON SFC 
DEWPOINTS WHERE THE CENTER OF THE HIGH WAS EARLIER IN THE DAY. THIS

NO MAJOR CHANGES TO FCST TODAY. HAVE ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE WORDING IN 
THE SOUTHEAST AND EAST DURING TIME OF MAX HEATING THIS AFTERNOON. 
THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THERMAL AXIS STILL IN THIS AREA DURING THIS 
TIME AND A SLIGHT HINT FROM THE ETA THAT THERES A WEAK LOBE OF 
INCREASED VORTICITY BEHIND THE MEAN H5 TROF. HAVE LOWERED 
TEMPERATURES IN THE SOUTHEAST FROM AROUND 80 TO THE UPPER 70S AND 
HAVE SHIFTED THE AROUND 80 WORDING TO THE WEST INSTEAD WHERE MORE 
SUN IS EXPECTED ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE H8 COLD POOL. 

DEWPOINTS DROP INTO THE 50S TONIGHT AND LOW TEMPS SHOULD APPROACH 
THEM IN THE EAST...AROUND 60 OR LOW 60S IN THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST. 
HAVE COME UP A FEW DEGREES FOR HIGHS ON FRIDAY TO COME IN LINE WITH 
SURROUNDING OFFICES...GENERALLY MID 80S WITH SOME LOWER 80S IN THE 
NORTH. PM LOWS FRIDAY WERE DROPED BY A FEW DEGREES ACROSS THE BOARD 
AS MODEL GUIDANCE IS SHOWING CLEAR SKIES AND A RELATIVE MIN ON SFC 
DEWPOINTS WHERE THE CENTER OF THE HIGH WAS EARLIER IN THE DAY. THIS 
COMBINATION TELLS ME THAT MID AND UPPER 60S IS ABOUT A CATEGORY TOO 
WARM ACROSS THE BOARD. HAVE LOWERED NERN FCST AREA TO AROUND 
60...WITH LOW 60S ELSEWHERE. 

HAVENT CHANGED TEMPS ON SATURDAY AT ALL. MID 80S SEEMS REASONABLE 
AND ANY CHANCE OF UPPER 80S SHOULD BE SQUISHED BY CU DEVELOPMENT. 

.ILN...NONE.

ATTM AS STORMS SHOULD BE MOVING FAIRLY QUICKLY AND HOURLY FFG VALUES 
ON THE HIGH SIDE...GENERALLY GREATER THAN 1.5 INCHES. WILL HOWEVER 
MENTION LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN IN ZONES.  UPPER LEVEL TROF REMAINS IN

ALL REMAINS QUIET ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AT THE MOMENT. THIS IS 
NOT TOO SURPRISING GIVEN THE CAP OBSERVED ON THE EVENING SOUNDING. 
EDGE OF CAP APPEARS TO BE FROM NORTHERN INDIANA INTO NORTHERN OHIO.

AM A BIT CONCERNED THAT THE CAP WILL HOLD IN THE WARM SECTOR 
POSSIBLY LEAVING THE AREA DRY OVERNIGHT. THIS IS SUGGESTED BY LATEST 
RAPID UPDATE CYCLE AND BY 12Z ETA WITH KAIN-FRITSCH CONVECTIVE 
SCHEME. STILL EXPECT FORCING TO INCREASE OVERNIGHT WITH LOW LEVEL 
JET INCREASING TO OVER 30 KNOTS. AND THIS COULD LEAD TO ELEVATED 
CONVECTION. WILL KEEP LIKELY PROBABILITIES FOR WEST CENTRAL OHIO. 
BUT WILL PULL BACK A LITTLE ON CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN A DRY FORECAST OVERNIGHT FOR SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO AND 
NORTHEAST KENTUCKY.

STILL EXPECT A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MOVE ACROSS THE 
REGION ON MONDAY. WAS TEMPTED TO INCREASE PROBABILITY TO CATEGORICAL 
BUT WILL LEAVE AS LIKELY FOR NOW AND LET NEXT SHIFT TAKE A CLOSER 
LOOK.

HAVE MADE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPERATURES AND WINDS 
OVERNIGHT. HAVE ALSO MADE SOME CHANGES ON THE SKY GRIDS WITH GENERAL 
TREND FOR MORE CLOUDS FOR THE NORTH AND FEWER IN THE SOUTH.

MCS DROPPING DOWN ACROSS INDIANA SHOWING SIGNS OF WEAKENING ON RADAR 
AND ON IR SATELLITE AS AREA OF COOLER CLOUD TOPS APPEARS TO BE 
SHRINKING SOME. EXPECT WEAKENING TREND TO CONTINUE THROUGH DAYBREAK 
BUT REMNANTS SHOULD STILL PUSH ACROSS SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF FA NEXT 
FEW HOURS. MEANWHILE FRONT STILL UP ACROSS FAR NRN IL/NRN IND AND 
LOWER MICH. MAJOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ETA AND GFS WITH THE FRONT 
TODAY INTO TONIGHT WITH GFS PUSHING IT QUICKLY SOUTH AND ETA HANGING 
IT UP ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR FA. BOTH MODELS HAD DATA 
INGEST PROBLEMS SO DIFFICULT TO LATCH ONTO EITHER SOLUTION. GFS 
TENDS TO PUSH THESE THINGS THROUGH TOO QUICK SO WILL GENERALLY GO 
WITH A COMPROMISE OF THE TWO MODELS AND PUSH THE FRONT SLOWLY SOUTH 
THROUGH LATE AFTERNOON AND INTO TONIGHT. WITH THIS IN MIND...NEXT 
QUESTION IS HOW QUICKLY THE DEBRIS CLOUDS WILL DISSIPATE...ALLOWING 
FOR DESTABILIZATION THIS AFTERNOON. WOULD EXPECT CLOUDS TO DISSIPATE 
THROUGH LATE MORNING WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FOR STORMS TO FIRE UP AHEAD

FRONTAL BOUNDARY IN THE SRN GT LKS REGION IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH 
FCST AREA LATE TONIGHT/EARLY TOMORROW WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ALONG IT TONIGHT. ACTIVITY SHOULD NOT BE TOO BAD AS 
MAIN FOCUS NOTED ON MOST MODELS IS AN MCS DEVELOPING WELL TO THE 
WEST WITH THE OVERALL MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT SOUTHWARD. SFC HIGH 
PRESSURE IN PLACE WILL ALSO HELP TO MINIMIZE THE STRENGTH OF THE 
STORMS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH AN UNFAVORABLE TIME FRAME FOR DEEP 
CONVECTION. BELIEVE THAT TEMPS TONIGHT ARE TOO COLD AS MODELS 
PROG LOW TO MID 60S DEWPOINTS POOLING AHEAD OF THE FRONT IN NRN 2/3 
OF FCST AREA WITH A DROP TO THE MID AND UPPER 50S IN THE SOUTHEAST. 
HAVE INCREASED TEMPERATURES TONIGHT SLIGHTLY.

AM SLIGHTLY CONCERNED THAT MODELS WERE ABOUT 100 MILES TOO FAR 
SOUTHWEST WITH CURRENT COMPLEX THATS SPARKED OVER CHITOWN. IF THIS 
TREND OF TOO FAR SOUTHWEST CONTINUES...MCS MAY TRACK THROUGH INDIANA 
VERSUS ILLINOIS TONIGHT AND BRING MORE RAIN TO WESTERN FCST AREA 
OVERNIGHT. HAVE INCREASED POPS AND TIMING ACCORDINGLY BUT NOT

COLD FRONT AT 19Z WAS FROM ERN MI...NRN IN...S CNTRL IL...THEN 
EXTENDED FURTHER SW INTO MO.  THIS FRONT WILL GRADUALLY CROSS THE 
CWFA TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.

CAPES ARE RECOVERING THIS AFTN...BUT SOME CIN REMAINS DUE TO DEBRIS 
CLOUDS FROM MORNING/EARLY AFTN MCS.  SOME CONVECTION IS BEGINNING TO 
BREAK OUT ACRS CNTRL AND NE INDIANA INTO NRN OHIO AHEAD OF COLD 
FRONT.  WITH STRONGER UPR LVL DYNAMICS REMAINING NE OF CWFA...ONLY 
REAL FORCING WILL BE LOW LVL CONV FROM SFC TO 925 MB AHEAD OF COLD 
FRONT.  ATTM...AM THINKING ABOUT 40 PERCENT CHANCE WEST...30 EAST 
INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.  ONCE THE FRONT PASSES...SKIES WILL 
GRADUALLY BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR.

AS DEPICTED BY THE ETA MODEL...FRONT SHOULD BE SE OF CWFA BY ABOUT 
14Z OR 15Z.  WILL CARRY A SLIGHT CHC FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
IN OUR FAR SOUTH AND EAST ON WEDNESDAY.  OTHERWISE...MOSTLY SUNNY 
CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED AS SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE 
REGION.

NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM IS POISED TO CROSS THE AREA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY.  SYSTEM SEEMS TO WEAKEN EVENTUALLY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY 
BY FRIDAY NIGHT.  ANOTHER HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE 
REGION ON SATURDAY.  

NEXT CHC FOR PCPN SHOULD COME ON MONDAY AS NWLY MID LVL FLOW BRINGS 
A S/WV AND ANOTHER COLD FRONT THROUGH.

        HAVE DROPPED ALL WILMINGTON COUNTIES FROM SEVERE WATCH.

H5 PATTERN IN FAIR AGREEMENT BETWEEN MODELS THROUGH SUNDAY. UKMET IS 
A LITTLE QUICKER THAN THE GFS SWINGING THE MEAN TROF TOWARDS THE 
EAST COAST ON MONDAY AND EVEN HAS A BIT OF NEG TILT TO IT. CANADIEN 
IS MID GROUND BETWEEN THE TWO AND HAS THE TROF E OF FCST AREA AT 
THIS TIME BUT NOT AS FAR E AS THE UKMET. ECMWF IS JUST SLIGHTLY 
FASTER, SO ATTM ID LEAN TOWARDS A SLIGHTLY FASTER GFS SOLUTION. AT 
0Z WED...MEAN TROF IS STILL OVER GTLKS REGION AND MRF SHOWING A 
REINFORCING WAVE DROPPING FROM THE NW WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY THE 
CANADIEN MODEL.

AT THE SFC...BOTH 0 AND 6Z GFS SHOWING A BIT OF AN INVERTED TROF 
MOVING THROUGH SERN FCST AREA AHEAD OF THE H5 TROF AS IT CUTS INTO 
THE PREDOMINANT RIDGE OF SFC HIGH PRESSURE THATS SUPPOSED TO LAY 
OUT SW-NE. CANADIEN IS DRY WITH THIS FEATURE AND REALLY HAS IT 
FURTHER SE TOWARDS VA. I BELIEVE THAT THE FEEDBACK FROM THE TROPICAL 
SYSTEM WILL CHANGE THE STRENGTH AND TRACK OF THIS WEAK SFC WAVE AND 
IM GOING TO KEEP THE FCST THE SAME WITH SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS ON 
SUNDAY AND PLAY DOWN THE MENTION OF THUNDER. YESTERDAYS HPC MAPS 
DONT ACCOUNT FOR WEAK WAVE AND JUST HAVE THE AXIS OF THE HIGH OVER 
FCST AREA. ON WED...GFS SHOWING A DECENT SFC WAVE MOVING THROUGH NRN 
GTLKS AND ASSOCIATED CDFNT. WILL KEEP THE CHANCE POPS GOING HERE 
(HIGHEST IN THE NORTH) FOR THIS DAY WITH THUNDERSTORMS BUT FEEL THAT 
THIS SYSTEM WILL WEAKEN AS IT RUNS INTO ESTABLISHED HIGH PRESSURE.

YET ANOTHER TSTM COMPLEX RIDING STAGNANT FRNTL BNDRY ON CURRENT IR 
SAT.  TSTMS TRACKING ACRS INDIANA HAVE BEEN WEAKENING OVER LAST FEW 
HRS...AND APPEAR TO BE MSTLY SUBSEVERE.  MORE TSTMS FURTHER WEST 
ACRS MISSOURI AND WESTERN ILL APPEAR DESTINED TO TRACK TOWARDS NRN 
KENTUCKY FOR MID MRNG INTO AFTN.  BIGGER CONCERN FROM TSTMS TO OUR 
WEST IS HVY RAIN POTENTIAL.  STORMS LINING UP WEST-EAST ACRS EAST 
CNTRL INDIANA...AND THAT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO FLOOD RAVAGED AREAS 
ACRS NW FCST AREA.

AS STATED ABV...BIGGEST CONCERN FOR NEXT 24 HRS LOOKING TO BE MORE 
TOWARDS POTENTIAL FOR HVY RAIN AND THREAT FOR ADDL FLOODING.  SVR 
THREAT HAS DIMINISHED FOR MUCH OF FCST AREA AS AFTN/EVNG CONVECTION 
ON TUESDAY REALLY WORKED OVER ATMOSPHERE.  CANNOT RULE OUT AN ISOLD 
SVR STORM TODAY...WITH GREATEST CHC ACRS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF FCST 
AREA.  FLOOD WATCH SET TO EXPIRE AT 12Z THIS MRNG...AND WITH MORE 
CONVECTION EXPCTD TODAY...WILL EXTND FLOOD WATCH ACRS NORTHERN 1/2 
FCST AREA THRU TONIGHT.  ANY PCPN WILL WORSEN ONGOING FLOODING IN 
WEST CNTRL OH...AND HVY RAIN THAT FELL IN DAY/CMH AREAS TUES COULD 
MEAN INCREASE FLOODING POTENTIAL IN THESE AREAS.  HAVE DECIDED TO 
EXTND WATCH A BIT FURTHER SOUTH...TO ENCOMPASS AREAS TO NORTH OF CVG 
METRO.  ALSO WITH MORE CLOUDS IN AREA...WILL DROP HEAT ADV FOR CVG 
AND HAMILTON CO.

ETA/GFS STILL FOCUSING ON FROPA ACRS FCST AREA THURS EVNG/NIGHT AS 
STRONG S/WV SPINS UP SFC LO AND TRACKS IT THRU LOWER GRT LKS.  BOTH 
MODELS (WITH GFS ESPECIALLY AGGRESSIVE) TRYING TO BRING DRY PUNCH IN 
ACRS NORTHERN COUNTIES TONIGHT WITH BNDRY FOCUSING CLOSER TO OH 
RIVER.  CONSIDERING MODELS HAVE HAD POOR TIME RESOLVING MESOSCALE 
FEATURES LAST FEW DAYS AND WITH BNDRY REMAINING IN AREA...DO NOT 
AGREE WITH THESE SOLNS AND WILL KEEP HI CHC POPS FOR ENTIRE FCST 
AREA TONIGHT.  BETTER FOCUS FOR CONVECTION THOUGH APPEARS TO BE ACRS 
SOUTHERN 1/2 FCST AREA.  LKLY POPS AS S/WV TRACKS INTO FCST AREA 
THURS AFTN...WITH TSTMS ENDING FROM WEST TO EAST LATE EVNG INTO ERLY 
FRI MRNG.  THE MUCH NEEDED BREAK FROM ALL OF THESE TSTMS STILL LOOKS 
ON TRACK FOR FRI INTO THE WEEKEND AS FRNTL BNDRY MOVES WELL OFF TO 
THE SOUTH AND EAST. 

TEMPS...WENT WITH FWC GUID TODAY AS MAV/MET GUID APPEAR TOO COOL.  
GENERALLY CLOSE TO MAV TONIGHT INTO FRI.  TEMPS NEAR NORMAL FOR 
WEEKEND WITH REASONABLE AMT OF SUNSHINE.

SCATTERED STRONG CONVECTION ALONG I-71 BTWN MT VERNON AND CLE...THEN 
LARGE MCS DROPPING QUICKLY ESE ACRS NORTHERN/CNTRL INDIANA.  
NUMEROUS WIND DMG REPORTS WITH MCS OVER INDIANA...HAVE TSTMS 
BEGINNING TO AFFECT WESTERN TIER OF COUNTIES BY 07Z.

NO BREAK IN PATTERN OF WAVE AFTER WAVE OF TSTM COMPLEXES TO CONTINUE 
ACRS OH VALLEY FOR NEXT 48-60 HRS AS FRNTL BNDRY OSCILLATES ACRS 
REGION.  FIRST ISSUE IS MCS BARRELING TOWARDS FCST AREA ATTM.  
APPEARS TO BE A BIT OF A WEAKENING TREND IN TSTMS OVER LAST HR...BUT 
RADAR STILL INDCG STRONG WINDS IN EXCESS OF 50 KTS WITH LEADING 
OUTFLOW.  ALSO...IWX/IND REPORTING WIND GUSTS 60-70 MPH ALONG LINE.  
TSTMS WILL BEGIN AFFECTING WEST CNTRL OH COS AND WHITEWATER VALLEY 
AREA OVER NEXT HOUR AND A HALF.  THEN EXPECT TSTMS TO CONTINUE ESE 
TRACK...SPREADING ACRS CWA NORTH OF A BROOKVILLE IND TO WILMINGTON 
TO CHILLICOTHE LINE.  MAY GET A FEW TSTMS SOUTH OF THIS LINE...BUT 
MAIN FOCUS WILL BE ACRS I-70 CORRIDOR.  SHOULD SEE TSTMS EXITING 
FCST AREA BY 12Z AT LATEST.

AFTER THIS MRNGS ACTIVITY...SHOULD HAVE QUIET MORNING/ERLY AFTN 
BEFORE CONVECTION STARTS FIRING AGAIN THIS AFTN INTO EVNG.  NICE

CONVECTION).  MUCH BETTER INSTABILITY IS AS CLOSE AS SOUTHWEST 1/2

MODELS ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SYNOPTIC SCALE.  
HOWEVER...DIFFERENCE IN DETAILS CONTINUE.  WILL LEAN TOWARDS ETA FOR

COLD POOL OVER FA WILL QUICKLY GIVE WAY TO MORE UNSTABLE AIR OVER

MUCH OF THIS WILL LIKELY BE OUT OF OUR CWA. WILL SEE HOW THINGS PLAY

STORMS MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN FCST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...AND A SVR 
TS WATCH NOW IN EFFECT TIL 01Z FOR PARTS OF THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL 
FCST AREA.  THE BULK OF THE SVR WX SHOULD STAY IN THE WATCH

POPS EARLY IN WATCH AREA...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS TONIGHT ACROSS 
NORTH AND CENTRAL AND SLIGHT IN SOUTH LATE.  WIND DAMAGE WILL BE THE 
MAIN THREAT WITH WBZ(S) ABOVE 11 KFT.

OTHERWISE...A RATHER HOT 4TH WITH TEMPS IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOW

CONTINUE HEAT ADVISORY FOR HAMILTON COUNTY...BUT WILL NOT ISSUE 
WARNING SINCE TODAYS HI(S) DID NOT QUITE MEET CRITERIA THERE AND

HAVE SEEN 2-3 IN ACROSS THE NORTHERN DAYTON SUBURBS THIS AFTN...AND 
GETTING 2-3 IN/HR RAINFALL RATES WITH OTHER STORMS.  OVERALL A MUGGY 
AFTN ACRS FCST AREA.

TWO INTERRELATED FCST ISSUES TO START...HOW MUCH ACTIVITY OVERNIGHT 
AND THE EFFECTS FROM REMNANTS OF BILL.  WEAK LO LVL CONV AND 1000-1500

EVENTS EVOLVED LAST NIGHT...FEEL POTENTIAL FOR ISOLD TSTMS ACRS 
ENTIRE FCST AREA THIS EVNG...AND AS FAR NORTH AS DAY/CMH AREAS FOR

MOISTURE AND CONVERGENCE AXIS SETTING UP LATE.  STORM MOTION NOT 
SLATED TO INCREASE MUCH OVERNIGHT...SO LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS FROM SLOW

NORTHERN EDGE OF CI SHIELD FROM BILL NOW ACRS SOUTHERN COUNTIES AND 
EXPECT MOST CLOUDS THESE AREAS OVERNIGHT.  MODELS HAVE COME INTO 
LINE A LITTLE BETTER THIS AFTN REGARDING BILLS TRACK THRU 
APPALACHIANS AND INTO VIRGINIA BY THURS.  ETA STILL FARTHEST NORTH 
WITH TRACK OF SYSTEM...BUT HAS BACKED OFF ON QPF AMOUNTS FROM

SEEMS UNREALISTIC...ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING BILL HAS HAD TENDENCY 
OVER LAST 24 HRS TO MOVE SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF MEAN FCST.  
GFS/ECMWF/UKMET ALL GOING WITH MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK WHICH WILL KEEP 
LARGE PCPN SHIELD WELL TO THE SOUTH OF FCST AREA.  REGION WILL 
REMAIN IN JUICY TROPICAL AIRMASS ON WED...SO THREAT FOR ISOLD 
CONVECTION APPEARS REASONABLE ONCE AGAIN.  WILL INCLUDE LO POPS ALL

NIGHT AS REMNANTS OF BILL TRACKS INTO MID ATLANTIC.  DRY WX FOR 
THURS AND GOOD DEAL OF FRI...ALTHOUGH INCREASINGLY HOT/MORE HUMID AS 
LO LVL THICKNESSES/850 TEMPS SLOWLY CLIMB THRU END OF WEEK.  TEMPS

DROP INTO FCST AREA LATE FRI.  HELD OFF ANY CHC FOR PCPN UNTIL FRI 
NIGHT ACRS NORTHERN COUNTIES WITH WEAK UPR FLO.

TEMPS...ALL GUID VERY CLOSE AND KEPT FCST TEMPS NEAR.  WARMED TEMPS 
A FEW DEGREES THRU FRI WITH LOWS GENERALLY M/U60S THRU END OF WEEK.

BY THURS MRNG WHILE GFS HOLDS TRACK ALONG THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY AND 
SMOKY MTNS.  UKMET/CANADIAN/NGM ALL TRACKING IN BTWN TAKING BILL 
INTO SW VA WED NIGHT/THURS MRNG.  WITH DIFFERENCES AND FOLLOWING 
THOUGHTS OF HPC...THIS SEEMS LIKE BEST SOLN AND WILL TREND THIS DIRECTION.  
RESULT WILL BE CHC SHRA/TSTMS FOR SOUTHERN 1/3 FCST AREA THRU WED 
NIGHT...WITH A SHARP NORTHERN CUTOFF TO SCT PCPN.  COULD SEE WIDE 
DIFFERENCE WITH CLOUD COVER FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AS WELL TUES NIGHT 
INTO WED.  HI PRES TO NORTH SHOULD FINALLY WIN OUT WED NIGHT...WITH 
DRY WX FOR THURS.

MORE CLDS/PCPN EXPECTED FOR TUES/WED.  850 TEMPS/1000-850 
THICKNESSES GRADUALLY WARMING OVER NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND SHOULD 
LIKEWISE SEE A SLOW RISE IN HIGH TEMPS.  ALL IN ALL...PRETTY CLOSE TO

AREA FOR FRI/SAT.  850 TEMPS CLIMB TO 20-21C ACRS SOUTHERN COUNTIES

CURRENT VIS SAT SHWNG GOOD DEAL OF AC/CI ACRS FCST AREA THIS AFTN.  
WEAK FRNTL BNDRY OR WHAT IS LEFT OF IT...APPEARS TO BE SOUTH OF 
I-70.  HAVE SEEN BETTER CU DVLPMNT ACRS SOUTHERN INDIANA AND 
NORTHERN KY WITH MORE SUNSHINE AND DEEPER MOISTURE.

COUPLE OF FCST ISSUES TO DEAL WITH...THE BIGGEST ONE BEING TROPICAL 
STORM BILL AND HOW IT WILL AFFECT OH VALLEY.  FIRST...REMNANTS OF 
FRNTL BNDRY WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY DROP SOUTH TONIGHT...FINALLY 
SCUTTLING ACRS NORTHERN KY ON TUESDAY.  GFS/ETA BOTH INDCG LO LVL

LOT OF STUFF GOING ON THIS MORNING.  THANKS TO RLX...PBZ...CLE...LMK 
AND IWX...DID I MISS ANYONE...FOR THE COORDINATION.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY RUNNING IN THE VICINITY OF I-70 IS ACTING AS THE 
FOCUS FOR CONVECTION ACROSS NRN INDIANA AND OHIO.  THIS BOUNDARY IS 
FORECAST TO SLOWLY DROP SOUTH THROUGH THE FA TODAY...PUSHING DEEPER 
MOISTURE SOUTH WITH IT.  EXPECT CONVECTION IN THE NORTH TO LAST INTO 
LATE MORNING THEN DIMINISH...WHILE CONVECTION REDEVELOPS IN THE HEAT 
OF THE DAY ACROSS THE SOUTH.  WEAK SURFACE HIGH BUILDS ACROSS THE 
NORTH TONIGHT...BUT WITH MOISTURE AND BOUNDARY ACROSS THE 
SOUTH...WILL KEEP MENTION OF CONVECTION.

ETA AND GFS ARE AGGRESSIVE IN LIFTING T.S. BILL UPPER THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY.  ETA IS THE 
STRONGEST...QUICKEST AND FARTHER NORTH...PUSHING THE LOW INTO KY BY 
00Z THU.  THE GFS IS WEAKER AND FARTHER SOUTH...WITH THE LOW IN 
TENNESSEE.  NCEP IS STATING THAT BOTH OF THESE SOLUTIONS ARE TOO 
FAST AND TOO FAR NORTH.  THEREFORE WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS EXTREME SOUTH ON WEDNESDAY.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES.  YESTERDAY FINALLY SAW TEMPERATURES JUMP AS 
MIXING FINALLY OCCURRED.  CURRENT GUIDANCE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD...SO 
JUST A TWEAK HEAR OR THERE.

AREA OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ENHANCED ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL 
INDIANA.  WILL UP POPS ACROSS THE NORTH TO CHANCE CATEGORY.  STILL 
NOT ALL THAT CONFIDANT THAT THEY WILL BE ABLE TO HOLD COMPLETELY 
TOGETHER AS THEY WORK EAST INTO THE DRIER AIR OVER OHIO.  WILL ALSO 
TAKE OUT TIMING ACROSS THE NORTH TODAY.


...ORIGINAL DISCUSSION...

SIGNIFICANT MODEL DIFFERENCES THIS RUN...ESPECIALLY IN THE LATER 
PERIODS.  FIRST  LETS TALK ABOUT TODAY.  MODELS ARE STILL 
ADVERTISING THAT WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL DROP INTO OHIO.  
SCATTERED CONVECTION HAS FIRED ON THIS THE LAST COUPLE OF DAY TO 
OUR WEST.  ATMOSPHERE IS STILL PRETTY DRY IN THE LOW LEVELS IN THE 
SOUTH.  THIS COMBINED WITH AN AREA OF NVA SWINGING THRU DURING THE 
AFTERNOON...SHOULD LIMIT CONVECTION TO THE NORTH....WHERE LI OF -2 
AND K GREATER THAN 30.   INSTABILITY REMAINS ACROSS THE N INTO 
EVENING...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

THIS IS WHERE THE MODELS DIVERGE.  ETA AND NGM TURN THE 500 FLOW 
MORE TO THE NORTHWEST LATE TONIGHT INTO MONDAY...WHICH BRING A 
SURFACE HIGH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND SHUNTS THE MOISTURE TO AROUND 
THE OHIO FOR MONDAY ...THEN WELL INTO KY MONDAY NIGHT.  THIS WOULD 
INDICATE THAT MONDAY NIGHT WHICH IS CURRENTLY HAS THE HIGHEST POPS 
SHOULD BE DRY.

THE GFS MEANWHILE IS MUCH WEAKER WITH THE UPPER RIDGE IN THE 
PLAINS...AND NEVER REALLY TURNS THE FLOW TO THE NORTHWEST...LEAVING 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND MOISTURE FARTHER NORTH.  00Z GFS DOESNT SEEMS 
AS WET AS THE 12Z RUN HOWEVER.

SO...AS MENTIONED ABOVE...WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE IN FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING FOR THE NORTH.  WILL TREND TOWARDS THE WETTER 
GFS TONIGHT INTO MOUND...BUT WILL DRY OUT THE NORTH.  WILL ACTUALLY 
ADD A 20 POP IN THE SOUTHWEST LATE TONIGHT AS MODELS SEEM TO 
INDICATE THAT MOISTURE FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY COULD WORK INTO 
LATE TONIGHT.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING ACROSS THE SOUTH MONDAY 
INTO TUESDAY.

GUIDANCE TEMPS HAVE BEEN TOO WARM THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS...AND THEY 
APPEAR TOO WARM WITH ALL THE MOISTURE FORECAST.  WILL STAY UNDER 
GUIDANCE FOR BOTH HIGHS AND LOWS THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WILL ACTUALLY

WITH S/WV DROPPING INTO THE UPR MS VLY AND WRN GREAT LAKES FRIDAY

INTO THE NRN CWFA FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY.

GFS/ETA ARE NOW BOTH SHOWING NEXT FRONTAL BOUNDARY REALLY GETTING

TUESDAY...LEAVEING A SMALL CHC FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACRS 
THE SRN CWFA.  BUT WITH LATEST 12Z GFS SHEARING FRONT APART AND

CURRENT SFC/SAT ANALYSIS INDCG COLD FRONT EXTNDG FROM CNTRL 
WISCONSIN SOUTH INTO CNTRL MISSOURI AND ARKANSAS.  LARGE AREA OF 
TSTMS THAT DVLPD LAST EVENING IN THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY HAD 
WEAKENED CONSIDERABLY OVER THE LAST TWO TO THREE HRS WITH CLOUD TOPS 
WARMING.  RIDGE STILL HOLDING STRONG ACRS OH VALLEY WITH CIRRUS 
STRUGGLING TO MOVE EAST INTO REGION.

ETA/GFS CONSISTENT IN BRINGING FRNTL BNDRY INTO OH VALLEY LATE THIS 
AFTN AND ACRS FCST AREA TONIGHT.  ETA REMAINS MORE AGGRESSIVE MODEL 
IN TERMS OF HIGHER INSTABILITIES AND PWATS (2 IN+) FROM LATE AFTN 
INTO EVNG.  SBCAPES CLIMB TO 2500-3000 J/KG BY 18Z WITH 70+ DEWPTS 
INTO REGION AHEAD OF FRNT.  MODEL SOUNDINGS INDCG NICE DRY INTRUSION 
ABV 700 MB THIS AFTN WITH MAX THETA-E VALUES BTWN 30-40.  EVEN WITH 
CI BLOWOFF FROM CONVECTION TO WEST THIS MRNG...SHOULD SEE DECENT AMT 
SFC HEATING WITH TEMPS EASILY RISING INTO M/U80S BY 18Z.  AXIS 925 
MB CONVERGENCE ARRIVES AFT 18Z WITH DEEPER CONVERGENCE AT 850 MB 
ARND 21Z.  GOOD UPR DIFFLUENCE ACRS FCST AREA WITH 120+ KT JET TO 
NORTH AND WEST OF REGION.  SPC INDCG SLIGHT RISK FOR SVR ACRS FCST 
AREA THIS AFTN AND THIS LOOKS REASONABLE.  MAIN THREAT WOULD BE FOR 
DAMAGING WINDS WITH A FEW OF THE STRONGER STORMS WITH HIGH MAX 
THETA-E.  WB ZERO A LITTLE HIGH UP AROUND 12KFT...BUT CANNOT RULE 
OUT AN ISOLD HAILER OR TWO.  WITH PWATS APPCHG 2 IN AND K INDEX 
VALUES BTWN 34-38 THIS AFTN...HEAVY RAIN WILL ALSO BE A 
POSSIBILITY.  FLOODING SHOULD NOT BE A CONCERN THOUGH WITH STORM 
MOTION PROGGED BTWN 20-25 KTS...AND RECENT DRY SPELL HAS ALLOWED 
COUNTY 1 HR FFG VALUES TO CLIMB ABV 1.5 IN.  WILL MENTION SVR AND 
HVY RAIN IN ZONES FOR AFTN/EVNG.  WILL ELABORATE MORE IN HWOILN AND 
PLAN TO ISSUE SPS AS WELL.

ETA/GFS DIFFER BY FEW HRS ON TAKING FRONT THRU FCST AREA 
TONIGHT...BUT EXPECT ENTIRE AREA WILL BE PCPN FREE BY 08-09Z. RAPID 
DRYING IN CAA BEHIND FRONT SHOULD ALLOW FOR GOOD DEAL OF SUNSHINE 
FRI.  GOING MSTLY SUNNY WITH HI TEMPS ABOUT 8-10 DEGREES COOLER THAN 
TODAY.  UPR TROF WILL QUICKLY SHIFT EAST FRI NIGHT WITH ZONAL FLO 
SETTING UP ACRS OH VALLEY FOR WEEKEND.  FRNTL BNDRY DROPPING OUT OF 
UPPER MIDWEST FRI NIGHT INTO SAT WILL STRUGGLE TO DROP SOUTH AGAINST 
FLO.  BOTH GFS/ETA INDCG PCPN ACRS LOWER GRT LKS SAT AFTN AND EVNG 
SHIFTING INTO NORTHERN FCST AREA LATE SAT NIGHT INTO SUN.  FRNTL 
BNDRY LOOKS TO HANG ACRS REGION INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH LO CHC 
POPS FOR SUN-TUES.  PREVIOUS FCST HAS THIS COVERED WELL...AND DID 
NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES.  

TEMPS...LOWERED TEMPS A FEW DEGREES TODAY WITH 850 TEMPS A BIT 
COOLER THAN WED AND AFTN CLOUDS/CONVECTION.  00Z GFS/ETA BOTH CAME 
IN A BIT WARMER FOR FRI AND SAT...SO WARMED TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO 
BOTH DAYS. THIS KEPT PRETTY CLOSE TO MAV GUID. GENERALLY NEAR NORM 
TEMPS FOR FCST AREA FROM SAT INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

OF PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH ITS PASSAGE. 

MODEL DIFFERENCES ARE MINOR OVER ILNS FCST AREA ALTHOUGH GFS IS 
NOTICEABLY STRONGER WITH SFC PATTERN AND ENERGY IN THE GTLKS REGION.

METRO AREA WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP UNTIL AFTER 0Z. GFS IS SHOWING A 
SFC WAVE MOVING THROUGH KY TOWARDS SERN CWA FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND 
THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE CANADIEN MODEL AS WELL. WILL INCREASE POPS 
TO LIKELY FOR THIS PERIOD...BUT ONLY OVER SRN AND ERN FCST AREA. 
PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO END BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON OVER MOST OF FCST AREA 
AND IVE ONLY GOT CHANCE POPS IN FOR THE EARLY NIGHTTIME PERIOD IN 
THE ERN CWA.

TEMPS BEHIND FRONT SHOULD DROP INTO THE 70S AND HAVE RANGED HIGHS

AT 06Z...SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A COLD FRONT ROUGHLY FROM SRN 
ONTARIO...ACRS LOWER MI...NRN IN...AND NRN IL.  

FOR TODAY...AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO BE FROM ERIE, 
PA...TO CHILLICOTHE TO CINCINNATI BY 12Z...AND THEN SOUTH OF THE 
CWFA BY 18Z.  PCPN ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT ITSELF IS SPOTTY AT 
BEST.  JUST BECAUSE FRONT WILL BE SOUTH OF THE REGION TODAY DOES NOT 
MEAN THE END FOR THE THREAT FOR PCPN.  MID LVL S/WV NOW ACRS THE UPR 
GREAT LAKES WILL DIVE SE TODAY TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY.  THIS 
S/WV...COMBINED WITH SOME WEAK LOW LEVEL POST FRONAL CONVERGENCE... 
AND A LINGERING UNSTABLE AIRMASS...SHOULD RESULT IN SHOWERS ACROSS 
THE REGION LATE THIS MORNING...AND THEN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
INTO THE AFTN HOURS.  BEST CHC FOR THUNDER WILL BE IN THE CVG AND 
PMH REGIONS WHERE DAYTIME HEATING MAY BE MOST EFFICIENT TO PROVIDE 
AN UNSTABLE AIRMASS.  WILL TAILOR POPS FROM 40 PERCENT NW TO 60 
PERCENT CVG AND PMH.

SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD COME TO END ACRS THE SRN TIER CWFA 
EARLY THIS EVENING...FOLLOWED BY PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS.

ETA/GFS HAVE BEEN IN SOMEWHAT DISAGREEMENT ON HOW UPR S/WV WILL 
DEVELOP INTO A CLOSED H5 LOW.  ETA HAS WAFFLED THE MOST WITH THE GFS 
BEING MOST CONSISTENT.  WILL CONTINUE TO LEAN TOWARD CONSISTENT 
GFS.  WITH PROXIMITY OF CLOSED LOW FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...TEMPS WILL 
REMAIN MAINLY IN THE LOWER TO MID 70S.  HAVE REMOVED CHC FOR SHOWERS 
EAST ON SATURDAY AS IT NOW APPEARS THAT LOW WILL HAVE PROGRESSED FAR 
ENOUGH EAST THAT SHOWERS SHHOULD NOT BE A THREAT.  SOME LINGERING 
850 MB MSTR COMBINED WITH DAYTIME HEATING WILL CREATE PARTLY CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS IN THE EAST DURING THE AFTN HOURS SATURDAY.

ONCE UPR LOW MOVES AWAY...A WARM UP IS IN THE FUTURE FOR THOSE WHO 
ENJOY WARM TEMPERATURES.  TEMPS WILL SHOW AN UPWARD TREND SUNDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY.

FLOOD THREAT TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE CWFA TODAY INTO TONIGHT.

SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED SFC LOW PRES ACRS CNTRL KY AT 07Z.  THIS LOW 
IS FCST TO MOVE NE INTO THE FCST AREA TODAY AND THIS EVENING.  THIS 
WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY.

KILN RADAR TRENDS HAVE BEEN SHOWING AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY THIS MORNING.  THE ACTIVITY ACRS THE SE CWFA 
WAS BEING INDUCED BY A WEAK S/WV ALOFT.  THE REMAINDER OF THE 
ACTIVITY...PARTICULARLY ACRS NW OHIO...WAS BEING INDUCED BY A S/WV 
OVER NE IL.  FOR TODAY...THE S/WV OVER NE IL WILL BE THE MAIN 
CONTRIBUTOR TO THE WEATHER AS IT PIVOTS SE INTO INDIANA AND 
EVENTUALLY OHIO LATE THIS AFTN AND EVENING.  THE AIRMASS STILL 
REMAINS QUITE MOIST WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER AMOUNTS RANGING FROM 1.3 
TO 1.7 INCHES.  AS THE S/WV INTERACTS WITH THIS AIRMASS...SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE THROUGH THE 
MORNING AND AFTN HOURS.  THE COVERAGE WILL BE MOST NUMEROUS EAST AS 
LOW LVL CONV ASSOCD WITH THE SFC LOW/INVERTED TROF WILL COUPLE WITH 
APCHING S/WV.  SINCE FFG VALUES REMAIN LOW (0.5 TO 1.0 PER HOUR)  
WILL CONTINUE WITH A FLOOD WATCH FOR MOST OF THE CWFA TODAY INTO 
THIS EVENING...EXCEPT THE NW COUNTIES AS THESE HAVE HIGHER FFG 
VALUES.

FOR TONIGHT...S/WV WILL PIVOT EAST...GRADUALLY ENDING SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FROM WEST TO EAST.  ACTIVITY SHOULD COME TO AN END IN 
THE FAR NE CWFA AROUND MIDNIGHT.

FOR WEDNESDAY...IT APPEARS THERE WILL BE A BREAK IN THE PERSISTENT 
RAIN BEFORE A COLD FRONT ARRIVES WEDNESDAY EVENING.  ALTHOUGH 
AIRMASS REMAINS SOMEWHAT MOIST AND UNSTABLE...AM HAVING TROUBLE 
FINDING ANY FOCUSING MECHANISM UNTIL AFOREMENTIONED FRONT WEDNESDAY 
EVENING.  THUS...WILL LEAVE FCST DRY DURING THE DAY.
FRONT WILL MOVE FROM NW TO SE ACRS THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
DYNAMICS/LOW LVL CONV IS WEAK...SO ONLY A LOW CHC FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE EMPLOYED.

IF ONE IS LOOKING FOR DRY AND SUNNY WEATHER...HOPE SHOULD BE JUST 
AROUND THE CORNER.  ONCE THE COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTH OF THE REGION ON 
THURSDAY MORNING...MUCH DRIER AIR WILL FILTER IN FROM CANADA.  SUNNY 
AND WARM CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

FLOOD WATCH UNTIL 6 PM FOR SE INDIANA...FAR SW OHIO AND NORTH

LOOKING AT H8, THE LOW APPEARS TO SHOW A SLIGHT MOVEMENT FROM 0 TO 
12Z FROM SDF TO CVG WITH AN INCREASED WIND MAX OVER WV AND SE OH. 
THIS CORRELATES TO INCREASED MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM CMH TO TOL 
THOUGH THIS DIRECTION IS TYPICALLY DOWNSLOPE AND I DONT THINK THAT 
NWRN CWA WILL SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT. 

MODELS SHOWING THE SFC INVERTED TROF TO REMAIN OVER WRN 1/2 OF CWA 
AND RETAIN ITS STRENGTH OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. ETA AND GFS SHOW CUTOFF 
LOW OVER CVG WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE WITH PLACEMENT OF H8 
LOW...WHEREAS THE NGM HAS IT MORE IN THE SDF AREA WHICH IS STILL IN 
THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY. IN ANY CASE, LIS ARE SLIGHTLY POSITIVE 
OVERNIGHT AND THEN GO NEGATIVE WITH DAYBREAK AND HEATING. WILL CUT 
THE THREAT FOR THUNDER OVER WRN FCST AREA ALONG AND N OF DAY TO 
ISOLATED TONIGHT AND MENTION SCATTERED SHOWERS VERSUS CHANCE. 

AM UNCONVINCED THAT WRN FCST AREA WILL SEE LARGE AMOUNTS OF RAIN 
TONIGHT BUT THE POTENTIAL RISES QUICKLY TOWARDS ERN CWA. HOWEVER, 
MODELS HAVE NOT HAD A REMOTELY DECENT HANDLE ON WHERE PRECIP WAS 
GOING TO OCCUR FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS AND IM GOING TO ERR ON THE 
SIDE OF CAUTION AND KEEP THE FLOOD WATCH UP OVER WRN FCST AREA. 

ATTM...IT LOOKS LIKE CONVECTION WILL BE FIRING ALONG A BOUNDARY FROM 
THE ILN/SDF CWA BORDER THROUGH MAYSVILLE INTO CHILLICOTHE. 
BOUNDARIES HAVE BEEN THE KILLER FOR THE PAST FEW NIGHTS (AND DAYS) 
AS THE STORMS THAT DEVELOP ALONG THEM REMAIN RIGHT WHERE THEY 
DEVELOPED. 

ON TEMPS...WILL CUT THE NRN GROUPINGS DOWN A FEW DEGREES AND OPEN UP 
A RANGE TONIGHT AS LOWER 60S ARE ALREADY BEING EXPERIENCED OVER 
AOH...FDY...MNN AND A 59 READING AT MFD. WILL LIKELY RUN READINGS IN 
CWA FROM 58 TO 62 HERE AND BREAK OUT A TIER OF COUNTIES FROM CMH 
GROUPING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. 

OTHERWISE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES...LOWER TEMPS IN THE NORTH AND DROP 
CHANCE OF THUNDER IN THE NORTHWEST.

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS MAINLY THE SOUTHERN 
AND CENTRAL FCST AREA THIS AFTERNOON ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK INV SFC 
TROF AND STRETCHED OUT VORT AXIS. WITH LIGHT MID FLOW DAMPING STORM 
MOTION...SOME EARLIER STORMS HAD PRODUCED SEVERAL INCHES OF RAIN IN 
LOCALIZED AREAS.  

AS TONIGHT PROGRESSES...THE 305 K ISENTROPIC SFC SHOWS WEAK/MOD LIFT 
WITH BEST SHIFTING TO E AND SE ALONG WITH LOWER SAT PR DEFS THERE AS 
WELL.  ETA LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE PATTERN MIRRORS THIS ALSO.  GIVEN 
THIS...AUGMENTED WITH THE MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE (PW/S AROUND 1.5 
INCHES)...WILL CONTINUE FLOOD WATCH FOR CURRENT AREAS TONIGHT AND 
ADD THE CMH COUNTIES AS WELL.  THE ETA SHOWS CONSIDERABLE QPF EVEN 
IN NW FCST AREA WITH A DISTURBANCE ROTATING AROUND UPPER LOW 06Z TO 
12Z TONIGHT...BUT GFS KEEPS IT DRY.  CONV/LIFT IS WEAKEST THERE EVEN 
WITH ETA AND FFG IS HIGHER SO WILL LEAVE THEM OUT OF WATCH FOR NOW. 

INV SFC TROF LINGERS THROUGH TUESDAY AS UPPER LOW/TROF MOVES ACROSS 
AREA WITH A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES.  S/W PUSHES ACROSS WEST BUT BEST 
LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE REMAINS EAST OF INV SFC TROF. CONSIDERING 
THIS...POPS OBVIOUSLY TRICKY.  WILL GO LIKELY POPS IN EAST BUT KEEP 
HIGH CHANCE POPS IN WEST AT THIS TIME.  WITH SLOW STORM MOVEMENT 
AGAIN...LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN A POSSIBILITY THROUGHOUT.  THINKING TEMPS 
WILL BE SIMILAR TO T0DAY.

NOT MANY CHANGES TO EXTENDED WITH DRYING TREND BY END OF WORK WEEK.

SLOW MOVING THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED THIS MORNING IN DEFORMATION 
AXIS OVER SOUTHEAST INDIANA. MEANWHILE...NEARLY STATIONARY SHOWERS 
CONTINUE ACROSS PARTS OF THE WHITEWATER AND MIAMI VALLEYS. WEAK 700 
MB CONVERGENCE AXIS NOTED ON 00Z ETA IN AREA OF CURRENT ACTIVITY AND 
THIS FORECAST TO REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS MUCH OF SOUTHERN HALF OF FA 
THROUGH 21Z BEFORE SHIFTING INTO SE PORTION OF FA TOWARD 00Z. THIS 
IN COMBINATION WITH WEAK S/W PROGGED TO PASS ACROSS AREA TODAY AND 
DEVELOPING WEAK INVERTED TROF INTO SOUTHERN OHIO SHOULD KEEP THREAT 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND TODAY. HARD TO PINPOINT EXACTLY 
WHERE THINGS MAY DEVELOP SO WILL GENERALLY BROAD BRUSH WITH HIGH 
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE SOUTH...WITH LOWER CHANCE TO THE NORTH. WILL 
TRY TO KEEP WAPOK GROUP DRY BUT WILL MONITOR RADAR TRENDS TO MAKE 
FINAL DECISION ON THAT BEFORE ZONE ISSUANCE. 

EXTREMELY MOIST AIRMASS FORECAST TO REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS THE AREA 
THROUGH TUESDAY WITH PWATS REMAINING IN THE 1.6 TO 1.8 INCH RANGE. 
THIS COMBINED WITH VERY LIGHT FLOW THROUGH THE MID LEVELS WILL ONCE 
AGAIN RESULT IN VERY SLOW MOVING STORMS WITH VERY HEAVY RAINFALL 
POSSIBLE. WILL THEREFORE CONTINUE FLOOD WATCH THROUGH TONIGHT. THINK 
BEST CHANCE FOR HEAVY RAIN WILL BE ACROSS THE SOUTH...BUT BASED 
ON WHAT HAPPENED ON SUNDAY...WILL ALSO INCLUDE WHITEWATER AND MIAMI 
VALLEYS IN WATCH AS IT SHOULD NOT TAKE MUCH RAIN FOR THEM TO SEE 
MORE FLOODING. 

THINK MODELS MAY BE UNDERDOING QPF FOR TUESDAY WITH FAIRLY STRONG 
S/W FORECAST TO PIVOT DOWN ACROSS AREA AND JUICY AIRMASS STILL IN 
PLACE. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR NOW BUT THIS MAY 
EVENTUALLY NEED TO BE BUMPED UP DEPENDING ON FUTURE MODEL TRENDS. 

HIGH TEMPS A LITTLE TRICKY DEPENDING ON HOW MANY CLOUDS AROUND NEXT 
FEW DAYS. WILL STICK PRETTY CLOSE TO GUID WITH HIGHS IN THE MID TO 
UPPER 70S THOUGH THIS MAY BE TOO WARM IF WE END UP WITH SIGNIFICANT 
CLOUD COVER. WILL ALSO TREND LOW TEMPS UP A LITTLE GIVEN MOIST

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWING BOUNDARY EXTENDING FROM NORTH 
CENTRAL KY INTO EXTREME SOUTHEAST OH. A FEW SHOWERS CONTINUING TO 
PUSH EAST NORTHEAST ALONG AND AHEAD OF IT ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHEAST 
KENTUCKY. MEANWHILE...WEAK UPPER LEVEL ENERGY HELPING TO KICK OFF A 
FEW ISOLATED BUT PERSISTENT SHOWERS TO THE NORTH OF BOUNDARY ACROSS 
PARTS OF CENTRAL OHIO. WILL THEREFORE HANG ON TO A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
A SHOWER ACROSS THE MIAMI VALLEY INTO CENTRAL OHIO FOR THIS MORNING. 

OTHERWISE...FOCUS SHIFTS TO REDEVELOPMENT LATER THIS AFTERNOON ALONG 
BOUNDARY. INSTABILITY PROGGED TO INCREASE AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON ALONG 
BOUNDARY WITH CAPES IN THE 500 TO 1000 J/KG RANGE ACROSS FAR 
SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF FA. ETA SHOWING DECENT LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE 
AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON ALONG FRONT FROM ABOUT 21Z TO 00Z SO EXPECT TO 
SEE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FIRE UP AGAIN LATE THIS AFTERNOON. 
PWATS STILL RUNNING VERY HIGH AND ONCE AGAIN STORMS SHOULD BE 
RELATIVELY SLOW MOVERS. WILL THEREFORE GO WITH A FLOOD WATCH ACROSS 
SOUTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES...JUST TO THE SOUTH OF CVG AREA AND THEN 
OVER INTO PMH AREA. ANY THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY LIKELY TO LINGER INTO 
THIS EVENING UNTIL LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING SO WILL GO THROUGH 
MIDNIGHT ON THE FLOOD WATCH. 

OTHERWISE WILL GO AHEAD AND JUICE UP FORECAST A BIT AS BOTH ETA AND 
GFS KEEPING BAGGY MID LEVEL TROF ACROSS REGION WITH WEAK INVERTED 
TROF NOSING UP INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. FOR NOW WILL JUST SLOWLY SPREAD 
LOW CHANCE POPS UP FROM THE SOUTH MONDAY INTO TUE.

HAVE TRENDED HIGH TEMPS DOWN A LITTLE BIT FROM CURRENT FORECAST 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY PER 1000-850 THICKNESSES AND POSSIBILITY OF MORE 
CLOUDS AROUND THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS HAD FRONTAL BOUNDARY FROM SOUTH CENTRAL 
ILLINOIS INTO NORTHWEST OHIO WITH WEAK LOW OVER SOUTHEAST ILLINOIS. 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUING TO PUSH EAST 
NORTHEAST OUT AHEAD OF LOW ACROSS SOUTHERN INDIANA AND INTO 
SOUTHWEST OHIO. THIS ACTIVITY PERHAPS ENHANCED A BIT BY WEAK UPPER 
LEVEL CIRCULATION NOTED ON WV IMAGERY. 

FRONT FORECAST TO SAG SLOWLY SOUTHEAST THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON TO 
AROUND THE OHIO RIVER BY TONIGHT. MEANWHILE...S/W ENERGY BACK ACROSS 
MO THIS MORNING WILL PUSH SLOWLY EAST ACROSS AREA THROUGH THIS 
AFTERNOON. MODELS ONLY INDICATING WEAK CONVERGENCE ALONG BOUNDARY AT 
8H THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PORTION OF FA ALTHOUGH 
ETA IS SHOWING A LITTLE BETTER CONVERGENCE AT 925 MB LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON GENERALLY ALONG AND TO THE SOUTH OF I-71. THUS THINK 
SOUTHEAST HALF OF FA WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR BEST CHANCE AT RAIN TODAY 
AND WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS THERE AND THEN TAPER BACK TO LOW CHANCE 
ACROSS THE FAR NORTHWEST. 

FLOODING POTENTIAL IS A CONCERN AGAIN TODAY AS PWATS REMAIN 
HIGH...GENERALLY IN THE 1.5 TO 1.8 RANGE THROUGH 00Z. RELATIVELY 
LIGHT FLOW THROUGH THE MID LEVELS WILL RESULT IN FAIRLY SLOW STORM 
MOVEMENT AS SHOWN ON FORECAST SOUNDINGS. THINK WE COULD SEE A 
SITUATION SIMILAR TO WHAT HAPPENED FRIDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING ACROSS 
THE NW PART OF OUR FA WITH SOME ISOLATED HEAVY RAINERS. WILL HOLD 
OFF ON FLOOD WATCH ATTM SINCE WIDESPREAD THREAT APPEARS LIMITED  
BUT WILL MENTION LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN ACROSS THE SOUTH.

SOME DIFFERENCES THEN DEVELOP WITH THE GFS/ETA AS ETA TRIES TO PUSH 
FRONT THROUGH AND DRY THINGS OUT WHILE GFS DEVELOPS ANOTHER WAVE 
ALONG FRONT TONIGHT INTO EARLY SUN AND KEEPS THREAT OF PCPN 
ACROSS OUR SOUTH. FOR NOW WILL SLOW THINGS DOWN A BIT AND HANG ON TO

ATTM...LETTING TONIGHTS EVENT BE THE PRIMER FOR MAKING THE SOILS

EVENT.

SHOWERS/TSTMS WILL CONTINUE ON WEDNESDAY AS COLD FRONT BEGINS TO SAG

AS THE AFTN GOES ALONG.

FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...HAVE SIDED MORE WITH THE ETA SINCE 
IT IS HAVING LESS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK PROBLEMS.  REGARDLESS...S/WV 
OVER SW U. S. WILL PIVOT INTO THE OHIO VALLEY...DEVELOPING A WEAK 
SFC LOW ON AFOREMENTIONED BOUNDARY ACRS THE CWFA.  THIS WILL BRING

RESPECT TO THE STRENGTH OF THE SHORT WAVES...WITH ETA SHOWING 
STRONGER WAVE TONIGHT...AND GFS STRONGER WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  GFS LOOKS 
TO BE SUFFERING FROM CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK THOUGH.

SURFACE CHART HAS LOW CENTERED OVER NORTHEAST NEBRASKA.  LOW IS

THEN SHOWN TO STALL OVER THE REGION THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH A SURFACE

MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WILL BE SHORT LIVED TODAY...ESPECIALLY IN OUR

AHEAD OF NEXT SHORT WAVE.  KEPT REST OF AREA UNDER CHANCE AS WELL.

WITH TWO SYSTEMS DUE TO AFFECT THE AREA...FLOODING PROBLEMS MAY 
DEVELOP OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  WILL REISSUE ESF TO HIGHLIGHT THE

NEXT TWO SYSTEMS TO AFFECT THE REGION. BUT FIRST FOR TONIGHT EXPECT 
MUCH OF CLOUD DECK TO DISSIPATE WITH LOSS OF HEATING. SOME THICKER 
CLOUDS IN EASTERN ZONES MAY HANG ON LONGER INTO THE EVENING BEFORE 
MOVING OFF TO THE EAST. 

FRIDAY SHOULD START OUT WITH JUST SOME THIN CIRRUS. WILL SEE

THE REGION. A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS MAY TRY TO WORK INTO WEST CENTRAL

INITIALLY DIGS THE ENERGY SOUTHWARD INTO THE ROCKIES BEFORE BEING

CURRENT SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS SFC LOW PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL OH MOVING 
SLOWLY INTO NE OH LATER TODAY. LLVL MOISTURE IS DOMINANT, AND -RA IS 
OCCURRING ALONG CONVERGENT WIND FIELD EXTENDING FROM IN/KY LINE 
THROUGH ILN TOWARDS CMH. OTHER SHOWERS NOTED SE OF THIS LINE AND 
REPORTS OF -RA ARE COMING IN WHERE RADAR BEAM IS OVER THE LOW CLOUDS 
AND NOT SHOWING MUCH IF ANY PRECIP.

CONVERGENT WIND LINE SHOULD PIVOT ALONG A POINT JUST E OF CMH EARLY 
TODAY WITH A SLOW EWRD PROGRESSION OF THE LINE OF -RA INTO SCNTL OH 
AND SCIOTO RIVER VLY. EVEN WITHOUT MEASURABLE -RA, DZ SHOULD BE 
APPARENT FOR THE SE 1/2 OF FCST AREA THROUGH AT LEAST NOON.

SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR IS ON NW SIDE OF SFC LOW AND FEW OBS ARE SHOWING 
ANY KIND OF PREICP. EXPECT NW 1/4 OF FCST AREA TO REMAIN OUT OF THE 
-RA AND DZ THIS MORNING. HOWEVER, PRECIP CHANCES WILL INCREASE THIS 
PM OVER NW FCST AREA...NE FCST AREA THIS PM AND EARLY EVENING AS H5 
VORT TRACKS JUST N OF A DAY-CMH LINE. 

TEMPS WILL BE DIFFICULT TODAY. FULL SUN FROM ILN SOUNDING GIVES A 
HIGH OF 73 BUT ADDING CLOUD COVER FOR MUCH OF THE DAY AND SOME 
MORNING FOG STILL GAVE A HIGH OF 67-68. DRAWING A MOIST ADIABAT WILL 
KEEP TEMPERATURES WHERE THEY ARE AS SOUNDING IS ALREADY MIXED 
THROUGH 805 MB MOIST ADIABATICALLY. A MOIST SOUNDING THROUGH THE DAY 
SHOULD ONLY GIVE A HIGH OF 61, AND IM GOING TO ERR ON THE SIDE OF 
CAUTION AND ASSUME SOME MIXING. CURRENT TEMPS LOOK GOOD IN THE NW, 
WILL DROP CMH, CVG, AND PMH ZONES DOWN A CATEGORY AND LIKELY OPEN UP 
A RANGE FROM 62-67 CMH/CVG, 64-69 AT PMH. 

WX IN THE AFOREMENTIONED GROUPS WILL BE SPRINKLES FOR A MAJORITY OF 
THE MORNING WITH A CHANCE OF -RA AND -SHRA. JUST PM CHANCE OF -SHRA 
IN NW GROUPINGS.

UPR LO CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY TO NORTH AND EAST THURS WITH SFC HI

POSSIBILITY THAT CMH/CNTRL OH (WHERE DEEPEST MOISTURE WILL LINGER) 
MAY STRUGGLE FOR BREAKS ALL DAY.  UPR LVL RIDGE WORKING IN THURS 
NIGHT WILL ALLOW FOR SKIES TO GO PTLY CLDY EVERYWHERE.

STILL SOME DIFFERENCES AMONG MODELS IN HANDLING OF NEXT SYSTEM FOR 
FRI NIGHT/SAT.  WHEREAS PREV RUNS OF GFS INDCG UPR LVL ENERGY 
SPLITTING NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE REGION (SIMILAR TO CURRENT ETA 
RUN)...00Z RUN HAS RESORTED BACK TO A WETTER SOLN WITH SFC LO 
TRACKING UP OH VALLEY FRI NIGHT THRU ERLY SAT.  ALTHOUGH QPF VALUES 
LOOK INFLATED DUE TO WHAT APPEARS TO BE CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK...THIS 
SOLN IS SIMILAR TO 03/12Z ECMWF.  HAVE SLOWED PCPN ONSET UNTIL LATE 
FRI FOR CVG/DAY REGIONS...AND UNTIL EVENING FOR REMAINDER OF FCST 
AREA.

TEMPS...HAVE STAYED CLOSE TO MAV GUID THRU FRI.  LOWERED TEMPS A FEW 
DEGREES FOR TODAY CONSIDERING HOW MUCH FCST AREA STRUGGLED TO RISE 
ON TUESDAY.  WENT WARMEST AT CVG WITH BEST SHOT TO BREAK OUT OF LO

SURFACE LOW CURRENTLY TRACKING INTO THE FAR SOUTHERN PART OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS SHOULD CONTINUE EAST THEN EAST NORTHEAST INTO 
EASTERN OHIO BY MORNING. STARTING TO SEE A FEW SHOWERS REDEVELOP IN 
SOUTHERN ZONES AND WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE PROBABILITIES IN THE 
SOUTH AND EAST THIS EVENING. COULD SEE ADDITIONAL SHOWERS DEVELOP 
LATER TONIGHT AS MORE ENERGY ROTATES AROUND THE UPPER LOW ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES. IN THE INTERIM WILL SEE AREAS OF FOG AND SOME DRIZZLE.

WILL CONTINUE TO SEE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS TOMORROW PRIMARILY ACROSS 
NORTHERN ZONES. LOW CLOUDS WILL HANG TOUGH TOMORROW AND TRY TO CLEAR 
AT LEAST IN THE WEST WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE LOW STARTS TO PULL AWAY. 
HOWEVER ENOUGH RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FOR A HEALTHY 
STRATOCUMULUS DECK TO REFORM WITH HEATING ON THURSDAY.

NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL COME IN FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND 
CONTINUE OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER THE FORCING FOR THIS IS LOOKING LESS 
IMPRESSIVE. LATEST GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT UPPER SUPPORT MAY MOVE 
PAST TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE AREA. WITH LITTLE INSTABILITY 
FORECAST WILL LIMIT THE MENTION TO SHOWERS.

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ON COOL SIDE THROUGH THURSDAY. GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE REASONABLY CLOSE AND FORECAST HAS FALLEN WITHIN THE

FORECAST CONCERNS THIS EVENING REVOLVE AROUND THE TIMING OF PCPN AND 
WHETHER TO INTRODUCE A CHC FOR THUNDERSTORMS.

00Z KILN ILN SOUNDING WAS DRY BELOW 11K FT.  KILN RADAR WAS SHOWING 
LIGHT PCPN MOVING INTO THE REGION...BUT MOST OF IT WAS EVAPORATING 
...AIDING IN THE SATURATION OF THE CURRENT DRY AIR COLUMN...OR

PERTURBED BY AN UPR LVL S/WV OVER NRN MO.  THE SFC LOW IS FCST TO

AND LIFT ASSOCD WITH THE MID LVL S/WV WILL COMBINED TO PRODUCE 
WIDESPREAD SHOWER ACTIVITY WEST TO EAST ACRS THE CWFA OVERNIGHT.
ONE WOULD THINK THAT ELEVATED CONVECTION IN TERMS OF THUNDERSTORMS 
WOULD BE A GOOD BET GIVEN TIME OF THE YEAR AND STRONG LOW LVL MOIST 
FORCING.  HOWEVER...ALL ELEVATED LIS REMAIN ON THE NEUTRAL OR 
SLIGHTLY POSITIVE SIDE (0 TO -2) FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT.  IT IS NOT 
UNTIL THE DAWN HOURS THAT ELEVATED LIS GO 0 TO -1 OVER THE SRN 
CWFA.  AS A RESULT...LEAVING THUNDER OUT FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT STILL

WOULD BE A GOOD BET GIVEN TIME OF THE YEAR AND STRONG LOW LVL MOIST 
FORCING.  HOWEVER...ALL ELEVATED LIS REMAIN ON THE NEUTRAL OR 
SLIGHTLY POSITIVE SIDE (0 TO -2) FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT.  IT IS NOT 
UNTIL THE DAWN HOURS THAT ELEVATED LIS GO 0 TO -1 OVER THE SRN 
CWFA.  AS A RESULT...LEAVING THUNDER OUT FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT STILL 
LOOKS OK AT THIS POINT.  WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR PCPN ACTIVITY TO 
THE SOUTHWEST FOR ANY HINTS OTHERWISE.  CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO 
BE WELL IN HAND...BRINGING 100 POP TO ALL LOCATIONS OVERNIGHT.  
OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE LOWER AND MID 50S LOOK REASONABLE GIVEN SOME 
EVAPORATIVE COOLING AND THEN RAIN COOLED AIR TO FOLLOW.

INTERESTING FORECAST AT HAND.  MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
WITH BRINGING UPPER LEVEL TROF OVER THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO 
OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT INTO MONDAY.  THE UPPER TROF WILL DEEPEN AND 
DEVELOP CUTOFF LOW OVER OHIO VALLEY/SRN GREAT LAKES.  UKMET/ETA AND 
GFS ALL HANDLE A LITTLE DIFFERENTLY.  ETA OPENS UP UPPER LOW THE 
FASTEST AND IS MORE PROGRESSIVE.  UKMET IS SLOWEST WITH MOVING UPPER 
LOW OUT OF REGION.  GFS IS IN THE MIDDLE.  THANKFULLY, THIS PLAYS 
LITTLE INTO THE ACTUAL WEATHER.  HOWEVER, IT DOES PLAY A FACTOR IN 
TEMPS.  WILL GO WITH COMPROMISE. 

PRECIP WILL SPREAD ACROSS FA LATTER TONIGHT WITH GREATEST THREAT 
ACROSS SOUTHERN FA. EVEN THOUGH LITTLE TO NO INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED 
WILL GO WITH MENTION OF THUNDER IN VICINITY OF SURFACE LOW ON 
TUESDAY.  WILL BACK OFF TO CHANCE POPS TUES NT AND WEDNESDAY AS LOW 
FILLS AND IS SLOW TO EXIT.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RESULTING IN MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ACROSS AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON. MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TO OUR NW CONTINUE TO THIN 
AS THEY PUSH SE TOWARD OUR FA AND EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT. ETA ISENTROPIC SURFACES IN THE MID LEVELS KEEP ALL LIFT 
TO OUR NW THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS FROM 
BOTH THE ETA AND GFS LOOK PRETTY DRY OVERNIGHT SO THINK SKIES WILL 
REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR. WITH SURFACE HIGH PUSHING EAST ACROSS FA 
OVERNIGHT... WINDS SHOULD BE LIGHT WITH DECENT RADIATIONAL COOLING 
FOR ANOTHER COOL NIGHT. GUIDANCE TEMPS HAVE COME PRETTY MUCH IN LINE 
WITH THIS GIVING LOW TEMPS GENERALLY IN THE 40 TO 45 DEGREE RANGE. 
THIS SEEMS PRETTY REASONABLE BUT THINK SOME OUTLYING AREAS COULD DIP 
INTO THE UPPER 30S ACROSS THE NORTH AND WILL ADD WORDING FOR THAT. 
WILL GO WITH NEAR RECORD TEMP WORDING FOR CVG (45 IN 1966)...DAY (41 
IN 1910) AND CMH (39 IN 1966).

ETA TRENDING CLOSER TO EARLIER GFS SOLUTIONS WITH SYSTEM FOR MON 
NIGHT INTO TUE WITH BOTH MODELS A LITTLE STRONGER AND FURTHER NORTH 
ON THE 12Z RUNS. WILL KEEP MONDAY DRY BUT THEN BRING PCPN IN DURING 
THE EARLY EVENING ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST AND OVERSPREAD IT ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE AREA BY MORNING. SURFACE LOW NOW FORECAST TO TRACK JUST SOUTH 
OF FA WHICH PUTS US IN A FAVORABLE POSITION FOR PCPN. WILL THEREFORE 
BUMP POPS UP INTO CAT ACROSS THE FAR SOUTH FOR LATER MON NGT INTO 
TUESDAY AND THEN TAPER DOWN TO LIKELY ACROSS THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF 
FA WITH CHANCE NORTH. BEST INSTABILITIES REMAIN WELL TO OUR SOUTH 
ALTHOUGH THE ETA IS HINTING AT A LITTLE BIT OF SURFACE AND ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY BRUSHING OUR FAR SOUTH BY 18Z TUE. WILL THEREFORE ADD A 
CHANCE OF THUNDER FOR THE SOUTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES DURING THE DAY 
ON TUESDAY. WITH BOTH ETA AND GFS TRENDING SIGNIFICANTLY 
SLOWER...WILL LINGER A CHANCE OF SHOWERS TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY AND THEN TRY AND DRY THINGS OUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. IF THIS 
SLOWER SOLUTION PANS OUT...TEMPS WILL LIKELY BE A LITTLE COOLER THAN 
CURRENT FORECAST SO WILL TREND TEMPS DOWN SOME.

GFS THEN BRINGS DOWN A FAST MOVING S/W FOR LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY 
MORNING. WILL MAKE SOME MINOR TIMING TWEAKS TO CURRENT EXTENDED 
FOR THAT WITH BEST CHC OF PCPN THURSDAY NIGHT. COLD FRONT THEN DROPS 
DOWN ACROSS AREA ON SATURDAY FOR ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. LOOKS LIKE POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR FRONT TO HANG UP

RATHER DYNAMIC SYSTEM WILL DROP OUT OF THE CANADIAN PLAINS TODAY AND 
MOVE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT. MODELS HAVE SLOWED THIS SYSTEM 
DOWN A LITTLE FROM PREVIOUS RUNS. SO WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP TODAY 
DRY. EVEN WITH CIRRUS SPREADING ACROSS EXPECT TO SEE A FAIR AMOUNT 
OF SUN. MID CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE UNTIL LATE IN THE DAY. 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 70S LOOK REASONABLE.

FOR TONIGHT INSTABILITY LOOKS QUITE LIMITED WITH MODELS SHOWING 
SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE SHOWALTER INDICES. WITH STRONG DYNAMICS EXPECT TO 
SEE SOME THUNDER BUT WILL LIMIT MENTION TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS 
WITH OCCASIONAL SHOWERS. WITH THE STRONG WIND FIELDS CANNOT COUNT 
OUT A FEW SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS. BELIEVE THAT THE ENTIRE FORECAST 
AREA WILL SEE PRECIPITATION TONIGHT WITH THE LONGEST DURATION OF 
PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES. 

PRECIPITATION WILL BE ONGOING IN THE MORNING IN THE EAST. EXPECT TO 
STILL GET WRAP AROUND SHOWERS IN MOST PLACES UNTIL THE SYSTEM MOVES 
FURTHER EAST LATER IN THE DAY. THUNDER IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION IN 
EASTERN ZONES BUT NOT SURE IF THERE WILL BE ANY REMAINING 
INSTABILITY SO WILL OPT FOR JUST SHOWERS. TIGHT GRADIENT ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF THE LOW WILL RESULT IN A WINDY DAY. 

COLDER AIR WILL NOT BE COMING INTO THE AREA UNTIL VERY LATE TONIGHT 
SO OVERALL BELIEVE THAT LOWS SHOULD BE RATHER MILD AND HAVE GONE AT 
OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE GFS MOS. HAVE LIMITED DIURNAL RISE ON SATURDAY TO 
3 TO 8 DEGREES DEPENDING ON LOCATION.

LOW CLOUDS WILL CLEAR SATURDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILD IN. LOOKS 
RATHER COOL WITH READINGS POSSIBLY APPROACHING RECORD LOWS. WITH 
ABUNDANT SUNSHINE ON SUNDAY AS THE HIGH BUILDS IN TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD GET BACK INTO THE UPPER 60S.

SHOWER ACTIVITY TODAY SHOULD BE FOCUSED IN THE EAST WHERE AXIS OF

LITTLE ASSIST FROM WIND CONVERGENCE AND SOME UPWARD MOTION. LIS ARE 
NEGATIVE EAST OF IN/OH LINE THIS AFTERNOON, THOUGH THE GFS IS A BIT 
FURTHER EAST WITH THE NEG LIS. WITH THIS IN MIND, WILL LEAVE 
MENTION OF THUNDER OUT. CANT DENY THE POSSIBILITY, BUT WILL LEAVE 
FOR AN UPDATE IF IT OCCURS. 

DRY ON FRIDAY, BUT FROPA ON SATURDAY WILL BRING LIKELY POPS TO MOST 
OF FCST AREA (EXCEPTION IS KY AND MAYBE FAR SE IN). WINDS WILL KICK 
IN BEHIND FROPA WITH CAA AND A 40-50KT H8 JET. WAS INITIALLY 
THINKING WINDY WITH 20-30 BUT WILL JUST GO WITH BREEZY AND COOLER 
15-25 MPH. 

HAVE DECREASED TEMPS ABOUT A CATEGORY ACROSS THE BOARD ON SATURDAY

FRI PM IF FRONT TAKES ITS TIME TO GO THROUGH LIKE THE GFS SUGGESTS.

SERIES OF SHORT WAVES MOVING INTO MEAN EASTERN US TROUGH WILL 
CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE REGION. THE FIRST WAVE WILL MOVE FROM 
WISCONSIN ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT. A SECONDARY SHORT WAVE 
OVER LAKE SUPERIOR WILL FOLLOW TOMORROW. THIS SECOND FEATURE SEEMS 
TO BE OVER DONE BY THE GFS. 

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXTENDING FROM INDIANA BACK ACROSS 
ILLINOIS AND INTO WISCONSIN WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA THIS 
EVENING. LOOKS LIKE BEST INSTABILITY WILL STAY TO THE WEST OF THE 
REGION BEFORE DIMINISHING LATER TONIGHT. EXPECT JUST ABOUT EVERY 
PLACE TO GET SOME PRECIPITATION WITH THE GREATER AMOUNTS IN SOUTHERN 
ZONES. SHOULD STILL BE A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS TOMORROW WITH 
HIGHEST PROBABILITY IN THE EAST. COULD GENERATE ENOUGH INSTABILITY 
TO GET SOME THUNDER.

THE AREA WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY. 
THE NEXT SHORT WAVE WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST LATE IN 
THE DAY. WILL KEEP FRIDAY DRY FOR NOW. BUT WILL BUMP CHANCE UP TO 
LIKELY FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. MODELS SUGGEST LITTLE IF ANY INSTABILITY SO 
WILL ONLY CARRY SHOWERS.

SHOULD BE AT LEAST SOME WRAP AROUND PRECIPITATION ON SATURDAY BEFORE 
ENDING ALTHOUGH LOW CLOUDS WILL BE SLOW TO CLEAR. APPEARS THAT THERE 
MAY BE A LONGER PERIOD WITHOUT RAIN FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. NEXT CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ON WEDNESDAY.

RIDGING TODAY IS NOT AS STRONG AS PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS SUGGESTED AND 
PREICP LOOKS TO ENTER MUCH OF FCST AREA LATE DAY WITH STRENGTHENING 
SFC TROF JUST W OF FCST AREA AT 0Z. HOWEVER, H5 VORT THAT HELPS 
MOISTEN ATMOSPHERE AHEAD OF SFC TROF IS PROGGED TO BE A GOOD BIT 
EAST OF SFC TROF AND ZIPS THROUGH FCST AREA DURING THE DAYTIME 
PERIOD. ID EXPECT SOME SHOWER ACTIVITY WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE 
VORT, BUT MODELS ARE DRY. THUNDER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVE WILL SEE 
HEAVIEST CONCENTRATIONS IN THE SOUTHWEST WITH THE APEX OF DIGGING 
SFC TROF/H7 TROF. H5 TROF IS MUCH LESS AMPLIFIED ON ETA TONIGHT.

HAVE RAISED TEMPS A FEW DEGREES TODAY OVER THE WEST AS SOME SUN MAY 
BE POSSIBLE OVER WRN FCST AREA. COOLEST DAYTIME TEMPS EXPECTED ON

UPR LVL VORT MAX WAS ASSOCD WITH A DEVELOPING CLOSED UPR LVL LOW.  
THIS UPR LOW WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
THROUGH SUNDAY.  WITH INCREASING 850 MB RH AND DAYTIME HEATING ON 
SATURDAY...EXPECT CU TO QUICKLY DEVELOP IN ANY CLEAR AREAS.  WILL 
INTRODUCE A CHC OF SHOWERS ACRS THE NORTH...CLOSER TO THE VORT MAX 
AND SFC INSTABILITY.

ANOTHER S/WV DIGS SE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY ON SUNDAY...DEVELOPING 
ANOTHER CLOSED UPR LOW OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY.  
THIS CLOSED LOW WILL ALSO BE SLOW TO MOVE EAST THROUGH MID NEXT 
WEEK.  THUS...WITH DISTURBANCES ROTATING AROUND IT FROM TIME TO TIME 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A CHC OF SHOWERS WILL HAVE TO REMAIN IN THE 
FORECAST.

ERODE AWAY...LEAVING MAINLY CIRRUS ACROSS AREA THIS AFTERNOON. 
EXCEPTION IS ACROSS THE FAR SOUTH WHERE SOME SC/CU IS LINGERING. 
CLOUDS COULD BE A LITTLE TRICKY OVERNIGHT WITH FORECAST SOUNDINGS 
SHOWING SOME MOISTURE REMAINING TRAPPED BELOW 850 MB. 925MB FLOW 
GENERALLY REMAINS FROM THE EAST OVERNIGHT ALTHOUGH THERE IS A WEAK 
SOUTHERLY COMPONENT WHICH MAY HELP ADVECT A FEW MORE CLOUDS INTO THE 
FAR SOUTH. ALSO...TAKING A LOOK AT THE LOW LEVEL (295K) ISENTROPIC 
SURFACES...SOME VERY WEAK LIFT AND SLIGHTLY LOWER CONDENSATION 
PRESSURE DEFICITS PROGGED ACROSS THE FAR SOUTH OVERNIGHT. WITH THIS

CLOUDY...AND LEAVE PARTLY CLOUDY GOING ELSEWHERE ACROSS FA.   

INVERTED TROF BEGINS TO NOSE UP INTO THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. ETA SHOWING SOME WEAK SURFACE BASED 
INSTABILITY ACROSS THE EAST BY 00Z FRIDAY BUT NGM/GFS KEEPING IT

CONVERGENCE AT 925 MB ACROSS THE EAST SO MAY SEE A LITTLE BETTER 
CLOUD COVERAGE THURSDAY AFTERNOON BUT THINK PARTLY CLOUDY WILL STILL

CONTINUE TO SHOW LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TODAY BEHIND FRONT.  SNDG 
PARCELS SHOW SOME POTENTIAL FOR CU.  LOCAL METHODS SHOW HIGH TEMPS 
IN THE LOW TO MID 60S AND FCST IS LOW 60S ACROSS BOARD.  MAY RAISE 
CURRENT FCST TEMPS JUST SLIGHTLY AFTER LOOKING AT TRAJECTORIES.

FOR THURSDAY...THE ETA AND GFS HAVE INVERTED SFC TROF MOVING IN FROM 
THE SE AS UPPER LOW APPROACHES FROM THE NW. THE ETA INITIALLY PUSHES 
QPF INTO FAR SE FCST AREA BY 18Z BUT IS MORE OF A BRUSH THAN THE GFS 
THURSDAY NIGHT WHICH HAS A TENTH OF AN INCH OR SO FROM CMH 
EASTWARD.  IN CORRELATION...THE GFS ALSO BRINGS THE H5 LOW FURTHER 
SOUTH AND IS STRONGER WITH IT AT 12Z FRIDAY.  AT THIS POINT...WILL

NOT TOO MUCH CHANGING IN THE SHORT TERM. PREVIOUS SHIFT TOOK A BLEND 
OF TWO MODELS THAT WERE SLOWLY COMING TO THE SAME SOLUTION WITH THE 
PASSAGE OF THE CDFNT TOMORROW. INSTABILITY SHOWERS AHEAD OF IT MAY 
SPARK OVER THE FCST AREA THIS EVENING...BUT IT WILL STILL BE A 
COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE WE KNOW THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN OR NOT. HAVE 
KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS IN THE NORTHWEST AS 
ETA AND NGM (ALBEIT A LESSER EXTENT) WERE BOTH FOCUSING SOME 
INSTABILITY SHOWERS IN A LOBE OF CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF THE FRONT THIS 
EVENING. 

WITH THE MODELS COMING TOGETHER, HAVE NOT TOUCHED THE TIMING OR 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIP WITH THIS UPCOMING SYSTEM FROM PREVIOUS FCST. 
ID JUST MAKE IT WORSE.

WILL HAND-EDIT MENTION OF HEAVY PRECIP WITH THIS FROPA AS PWATS 
REMAIN AROUND 1.6 INCHES FOR SEVERAL HOURS TOMORROW. WITH FAIR 
PROGRESSION OF SYSTEM, DONT THINK THAT THERE WILL BE MUCH IN THE 
WAY OF FLOODING OR STATIONARY/TRAINING CELLS, BUT IM SURE THAT A 
FEW VERY HEAVY DOWNPOURS WILL OCCUR WITH THESE STORMS. 

INITIALLY THOUGHT THAT THURS WOULD BE QUITE COOL, BUT HAVE BUMPED 
TEMPS A BIT MORE TO COME WITHIN A FEW DEGREES OF WARMER SURROUNDING 
FOS. AGREE THAT PLENTY OF SUNSHINE WILL ALLOW READINGS TO RECOVER, 
BUT CAA SHOULD WIN OUT AND I DONT SEE TEMPS REACHING MUCH PAST THE 
MID 60S HERE. 

ON THE EXTENDED...WILL LEAVE THINGS DRY THROUGH FRIDAY THOUGH SERN 
FCST AREA HAS AN INCREASED RH FIELD WITH ERN MOISTURE MOVING IN. 
THINKING HERE IS THAT NE WINDS ARE DOWNSLOPE AND DRYING. ANY PRECIP 
SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL SATURDAY. WILL INCREASE POPS WITH A 30-40% 
BEGINNING LATER SATURDAY, INCREASE TO 50 POPS SUNDAY (WOULD LIKE TO 
GO LIKELY WITH CUTOFF LOW RIGHT OVERTOP OF OHIO AS NOTED ON MRF BUT 
WILL HOLD OFF THAT FAR OUT).

TEMPS SHOULD BE ON THE COLD SIDE AND HAVE SHAVED A FEW DEGREES OFF 
OF GUIDANCE THROUGH THE PERIOD. CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE IN THIS 
AIRMASS, BUT THE MAJORITY OF PRECIP SHOULD BE STRATIFORM AND IM 
JUST MENTIONING RAIN WITH CLOUDY SKIES.

1056 AM EDT SUN MAY 18 2003

AIRMASS TODAY SHOULD ORIGINATE FROM THE CENTRAL CAROLINAS IF SFC 
PARCEL TRAJECTORIES FROM NGM ARE CLOSE. I FEEL THAT SOURCE REGION 
WILL BE A GOOD BIT FURTHER SW...SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL AL/MS WITH 
CURRENT CYCLONIC PATTERN STILL OVER FCST AREA AND THE SFC AND H5 
LOWS BREAKING UP OVER THE GULF STATES. H8 JET SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
BRING SOME SORT OF A MOISTURE FEED TO THE CWA...BUT DIVERGENT 
PATTERN NOTED ON RADAR LOOP SHOULD WIN OUT OVER THE WEAKENING H8 
SOUTHERLY WINDS. IN EITHER CASE, SFC TEMPS IN BOTH REGIONS WERE 
AROUND 70 OR THE UPPER 60S FOR HIGHS YESTERDAY AND FEEL THAT THIS IS 
GOOD TODAY AS WELL. 

WILL KEEP SCT SHRA FOR S 1/2 OF FCST AREA WITH SOME SPRINKLES 
POSSIBLE IN THE NORTH TODAY (EXEPT WAPAK AREA). SERN FCST AREA WILL 
BE LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTY YOURE IN...WILL 
TRY TO MAKE A NICER PICTURE FOR THE GROUPING BUT MIGHT END UP 
SPLITTING THIS APART TO ACCOUNT FOR DISCREPANCIES. 

ON TEMPS...SURROUNDING FOS ARE A BIT WARM TO MY TASTE. WOULD HAVE 
DROPPED A DEGREE OR TWO ACROSS THE BOARD WITH A MOIST ADIABAT 
CROSSING THE MIXING LEVEL AOA 19.5C. THIS WOULD GIVE A MOIST MIXED 
LAYER SFC HIGH OF 67 AT ILN TODAY WHICH IS IN LINE WITH CURRENT 
FCST. DRY ADIABATIC SOUNDING WOULD SHOOT US UP TO MID TO UPPER 70S 
IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR BUT I DOUBT THAT MANY PLACES WITH EXCEPTION OF

AIRMASS TODAY SHOULD ORIGINATE FROM THE CENTRAL CAROLINAS IF SFC 
PARCEL TRAJECTORIES FROM NGM ARE CLOSE. I FEEL THAT SOURCE REGION 
WILL BE A GOOD BIT FURTHER SW...SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL AL/MS WITH 
CURRENT CYCLONIC PATTERN STILL OVER FCST AREA AND THE SFC AND H5 
LOWS BREAKING UP OVER THE GULF STATES. H8 JET SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
BRING SOME SORT OF A MOISTURE FEED TO THE CWA...BUT DIVERGENT 
PATTERN NOTED ON RADAR LOOP SHOULD WIN OUT OVER THE WEAKENING H8 
SOUTHERLY WINDS. IN EITHER CASE, SFC TEMPS IN BOTH REGIONS WERE 
AROUND 70 OR THE UPPER 60S FOR HIGHS YESTERDAY AND FEEL THAT THIS IS 
GOOD TODAY AS WELL. 

WILL KEEP SCT SHRA FOR S 1/2 OF FCST AREA WITH SOME SPRINKLES 
POSSIBLE IN THE NORTH TODAY (EXEPT WAPAK AREA). SERN FCST AREA WILL 
BE LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL DEPENDING ON WHICH COUNTY YOURE IN...WILL 
TRY TO MAKE A NICER PICTURE FOR THE GROUPING BUT MIGHT END UP 
SPLITTING THIS APART TO ACCOUNT FOR DISCREPANCIES. 

ON TEMPS...SURROUNDING FOS ARE A BIT WARM TO MY TASTE. WOULD HAVE 
DROPPED A DEGREE OR TWO ACROSS THE BOARD WITH A MOIST ADIABAT 
CROSSING THE MIXING LEVEL AOA 19.5C. THIS WOULD GIVE A MOIST MIXED 
LAYER SFC HIGH OF 67 AT ILN TODAY WHICH IS IN LINE WITH CURRENT 
FCST. DRY ADIABATIC SOUNDING WOULD SHOOT US UP TO MID TO UPPER 70S 
IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR BUT I DOUBT THAT MANY PLACES WITH EXCEPTION OF 
FAR SWRN FCST AREA WOULD GET INTO 70S TODAY. 

WILL NOT CHANGE TEMPS AT ALL AND TRY TO EINSTEIN THE AREAS OF

MODELS IN RATHER GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. THEY 
FORECAST DEFORMATION ZONE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE AREA TO 
PUSH SOUTH AS RIDGE BUILDS IN TO THE NORTHWEST AND CLOSED LOW DROPS 
TOWARDS THE GULF COAST. ALONG WITH SOME ENHANCED OVERRUNNING EXPECT 
TO SEE PRECIPITATION CURRENTLY SHOWN ON RADAR TO INCREASE IN 
COVERAGE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. DO NOT 
EXPECT AN EXCESSIVE AMOUNT OF RAIN BEFORE IT DIMINISHES LATER THIS 
MORNING. THERE IS LITTLE OR NO INSTABILITY FORECAST SO WILL ONLY 
INCLUDE SHOWERS. EXPECT SHOWERS TO BECOME SCATTERED DURING THE 
AFTERNOON.

AXIS OF HIGHER MOISTURE REMAINS ACROSS THE REGION OVERNIGHT. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO PAINT SOME VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS OVER THE 
AREA AND CANNOT DISCOUNT THIS. BUT WOULD EXPECT SHOWERS TO BE 
ISOLATED. CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO MAKE CHANGES TO FORECAST. SO 
WILL KEEP A CHANCE GOING IN SOUTHERN ZONES WHICH WILL HAVE DEEPER 
MOISTURE WITH PROBABILITIES BELOW THRESHOLD FURTHER NORTH.

AS DRIER AIR TRIES TO PUSH IN FROM THE NORTHEAST THE BETTER MOISTURE 
WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST HALF OF THE AREA ON MONDAY. IN 
THESE ZONES THERE COULD BE SOME AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS. 
EXPECT THERE TO BE A BREAK BETWEEN THIS DIURNAL PRECIPITATION AND 
THAT ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT LATE MONDAY NIGHT. 
HAVE BUMPED POPS UP TO LIKELY ON TUESDAY AS THIS FRONT MOVES ACROSS 
THE AREA.

TEMPERATURE WISE HAVE LIMITED DIURNAL RISE TO 8 TO 10 DEGREES TODAY 
WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION DURING THE MORNING. 
STILL EXPECT TO HAVE A GOOD DEAL OF CLOUD COVER ON MONDAY SO HAVE 
SHADED A LITTLE COOLER THAN GUIDANCE NUMBERS. EXPECT MILD OVERNIGHT

BY SATURDAY AS A MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW REDEVELOPS AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TROF.  AXIS OF THE WEAKENING TROF 
WILL PASS OVER THE AREA ON SUNDAY.  

SURFACE MAP HAS WEAK INVERTED TROF WELL AHEAD OF OKLAHOMA LOW.  LOW 
IS PROGGED TO MOVE SLOWLY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY JUST AHEAD OF THE 
WEAKENING UPPER TROF.  WARM FRONT AHEAD OF THE LOW WILL LIFT TOWARD 
OUR REGION TONIGHT.  GFS HAS BEEN MORE CONSISTENT IN BRINGING PRECIP 
IN HERE AND IS THE PREFERRED MODEL.  HOWEVER...GFS QPF IS PROBABLY 
OVERDONE WITH CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK...WITH CLOSE TO 7 INCHES FOR THE 
WEEKEND NEAR THE RIVER.  WILL RAISE POPS TO 40 ALONG OHIO RIVER 
SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...WHILE SPREADING CHANCE POPS INTO 
DAYTON AND COLUMBUS. 

FRONT IS FORECAST TO FESTER OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS THE 
SURFACE AND UPPER LOWS FILL IN.  SLOW MOVING SYSTEM WILL WARRANT 
CLOSE MONITORING OF FLOOD POTENTIAL DUE TO MOIST SOIL CONDITIONS.  
RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS ACTIVITY WILL BE SCATTERED IN NATURE SO A WATCH 
WILL NOT BE ISSUED AT THIS TIME.  

WITH HIGHER AMOUNTS OF CLOUDS AND PRECIP EXPECTED...WILL LOWER HIGH

GIVEN CURRENT TRENDS IN VISIBILITY HAVE DECIDED TO PUT OUT A DENSE 
FOG ADVISORY FOR WESTERN ZONES NORTH OF THE CINCINNATI TRI-STATE.

PREV DISC...

FIRST CONCERN IS FOG EARLY THIS MORNING. WITH LIGHT WINDS AND PLENTY 
OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IT LOOKS LIKE THE FOG IS FILLING IN ACROSS THE 
AREA. WITH A WEAK GRADIENT THIS FOG MAY LINGER WELL INTO THE MORNING.

UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT OFF TO THE EAST. 
A SHORT WAVE WILL SLIDE UNDERNEATH THIS LOW. BUT LOOKS LIKE LITTLE 
IN THE WAY OF UPWARD MOTION WILL BE GENERATED BY THIS. SO WILL KEEP 
FORECAST DRY.

MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT TAKING CLOSED LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THEN WEAKENING. HOWEVER 
THE GFS CONTINUES TO HAVE FEEDBACK PROBLEMS ON THE NORTHERN EDGE OF 
THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD. SO HAVE SIDED WITH THE ETA FOR THIS 
FORECAST. THIS MEANS THAT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL GENERALLY BE 
LIMITED TO THE SOUTHERN ZONES FOR THE WEEKEND CLOSER TO THE 
DEVELOPING WARM FRONT/INVERTED TROUGH. AND IT SHOULD REMAIN A LOW 
CHANCE. HOWEVER AM A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT SOME SHOWERS DEVELOPING 
INTO CENTRAL OHIO LATE SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT. THE ETA HAS 
BEEN HINTING AT THIS POSSIBILITY FOR THREE OUT OF THE PAST FOUR 
RUNS. BUT WILL KEEP PROBABILITIES BELOW THRESHOLD FOR MENTIONABLE 
PRECIPITATION FOR NOW IN THAT AREA.  

GENERALLY STAYED MIDDLE OF THE ROAD ON TEMPERATURES. BELIEVE THAT 
THE GFS MOS HIGHS ARE TOO COLD BECAUSE IT HAS TOO MUCH MOISTURE DUE 
TO FEEDBACK. ETA MOS IS PROBABLY HIGH END OF WHERE TEMPERATURES 
COULD END UP. LOWS ARE FAIRLY CLOSE FROM BOTH MODELS AND SAW LITTLE 
REASON TO DEVIATE.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES SURFACE LOW BETWEEN BETWEEN KSDF AND KCVG 
WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY THEN PUSHING NORTH INTO WESTERN OHIO OVER TO 
LAKE ERIE.  KILN SHOWING DEEP CONVECTION ALONG TD BOUNDARY MAINLY 
JUST SOUTH OF OHIO RIVER BEFORE MAKING IT NORTH NEAR PORTSMOUTH. 

MODELS LOOK PRETTY GOOD THROUGH 36 HOURS THEN THEY DIFFER BEGINNING 
FRIDAY NIGHT.  GFS IS STILL BRINGING CONVECTION INTO SOUTHERN FA.  
IT HAS TRENDED FARTHER SOUTH THE LAST FEW DAYS.  ETA IS STILL DRY.  
WILL KEEP SMALL POPS GOING ACROSS THE SOUTH.  

AS FOR OVERNIGHT.  WILL KEEP POPS MENTIONED IN THE WEST FOR THE 
EVENING AND LIKELY IN THE EAST.  SYNOPTICALLY THE MID LEVEL TROF IS 
GOING TO A NEGATIVE TILT AND GOOD SYNOPTIC LIFT IS TAKING PLACE.  
HOWEVER THE BETTER INSTABILITY IS LOCATED ALONG THE TD BOUNDARY 
ALONG SOUTHERN FA BORDER.  THINK CONVECTION HAS A CHANCE OF STRONG 
TO SEVERE IN THE EAST...WHERE A LITTLE MORE DAYTIME HEATING IS 
TAKING PLACE. 

MAV TEMPS LOOK PRETTY GOOD...EXCEPT FOR SATURDAY WHERE IT SEEMS A

OCCURRING OVER THE CWFA ATTM.  S/WV MOVING INTO THE REGION MAY KEEP

ABOUT 500 TO 1000 J/KG OF SBCAPE THIS AFTN...DEPENDING ON HOW WARM 
IT GETS.  THE WIND SHEAR IS WEAK...SO STORMS SHOULD BE MORE PULSE IN 
NATURE.  WET BULB ZERO IS FCST TO BE NEAR 7 KFT...WHICH WOULD POSE A

SINCE THIS CAN OCCUR WITH DESCENDING HAIL CORES.  WILL GO SHOWERS

DEPENDING ON HOW CURRENT RADAR ECHOES LOOK NEAR ISSUANCE TIME.

FOR TONIGHT...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE 
EARLY EVENING HOURS...THEN WEAKEN AS S/WV AND UPR LOW BEGIN TO SHEAR

THROUGH THE EVENING/EARLY MORNING HOURS.

FOR FRIDAY...AM CONCERNED WITH WEAK SFC INVERTED TROF OVER THE ERN 
CWFA.  THIS TROF...COUPLED WITH ANY HEATING IN THE MORNING...MAY BE 
ENOUGHT TO TRIGGER A SHOWER BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS.  IF TEMPS WERE 
TO APCH THE 74 DEGREE RANGE...A THUNDERSTORM COULD ALSO OCCUR AS 
SBCAPES WOULD EXCEED MID LVL INVERSION.  CURRENT FORECAST HAS DRY 
CONDITIONS...AND ATTM DO NOT WANT TO FLIP-FLOP FCST FROM WET TO DRY

REINTRODUCED.

WILL STILL BE BREEZY OVER MOST LOCATIONS THIS AFTN AS MIXING 
OCCURS...AND HIGHER WINDS ALOFT GET TRANSPORTED DOWN TO THE SFC.

WILL TRY TO GET FORECAST PACKAGE OUT A LITTLE EARLY GIVEN SEVERE 
WEATHER THREAT. COLD FRONT FORECAST TO PUSH THROUGH FA THIS MORNING 
AND SHOULD SEE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVERSPREAD AREA OVER THE 
NEXT FEW HOURS AND THEN END FAIRLY QUICKLY FROM WEST TO EAST AS 
FRONT PUSHES THROUGH. WILL HANG ON TO PCPN EARLY IN THE WEST AND 
THROUGH MID MORNING IN THE EAST. WILL CONTINUE WITH SEVERE WORDING
AND HEAVY RAIN THRREAT AND WILL HANG ON TO FLOOD WATCH THROUGH NOON 
ENTIRE FA. THIS PROBABLY A LITTLE LONG...ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST BUT 
WILL JUST CANCEL IT ONCE THE PCPN MOVES OUT.

NEXT CONCERN FOR TODAY WILL BE HIGH WINDS IN CAA PATTERN BEHIND 
FRONT. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW 40 KNOTS AT 925 MB AND THEN 50 OR SO 
KNOTS AT 850 MB WITH A GRADUAL INCREASE THROUGH 00Z. TIME HEIGHT 
CROSS SECTIONS OF POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE AND WINDS SHOWING NEARLY 
VERTICAL DOWNGLIDE FROM ABOUT 800 MB TO THE SURFACE FROM ROUGHLY 12Z

COINCIDES WITH THE 40 TO 50 KNOT WINDS AND THINK IT WILL BE PRETTY 
EASY TO GET SOME OF THIS DOWN TO THE SURFACE. WILL THEREFORE GO WITH 
A HIGH WIND WARNING ACROSS THE NORTH HALF OF FA AND CONTINUE WITH 
WIND ADVISORY IN THE SOUTH FOR TODAY. CAA LETS UP SOME BY TONIGHT 
BUT STILL STRONG WINDS JUST OFF THE SURFACE SO THINK WIND ADVISORY 
CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT. 

WRAP AROUND MOISTURE DROPS DOWN LATER TONIGHT AND MONDAY. WILL NOT 
MESS TOO MUCH WITH CURRENT FORECAST AND KEEP BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE NOTHEAST HALF OF FA.

.ILN....FLOOD WATCH ENTIRE FA UNTIL NOON.
        HIGH WIND WARNING NORTH HALF OF FA TODAY THROUGH EARLY

THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX PUSHING ACROSS NORTHERN INDIANA THIS MORNING 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST INTO NORTHERN OHIO THIS MORNING AS NOSE 
OF 40 KT 925 MB JET SHIFTS EAST INTO NORTHWEST OHIO. BASED ON 
300-850 MB THICKNESS...LOOKS LIKE SOME POTENTIAL FOR STORMS TO DROP 
A LITLLE MORE SOUTHEAST TOWARD CENTRAL OHIO TOWARD 12Z. WILL 
THEREFORE GO WITH LIKELY POPS FOR WAPOK AND CMH GROUPS WITH HIGH CHC 
JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THERE. 

WARMFRONT WILL LIFT NORTH ACROSS AREA THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON WITH 
GOOD WARMING ACROSS AREA. 1000-850 MB THICKNESSES SUPPORTING HIGHS 
IN THE LOW TO MID 80S TODAY. THIS SEEMS REASONABLE ACROSS THE SOUTH 
BUT WILL GO A LITTLE COOLER THAN THAT ACROSS THE NORTH WITH BETTER 
CHANCE OF PCPN THIS MORNING. GOOD INSTABILITY ACROSS AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON BUT WITH FRONT LIFTING NORTH...BEST FORCING HEADS NORTH 
TOO SO WILL GENERALY GO WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND 
INTO EARLY THIS EVENING. 

BETTER CHANCE THEN SPREADS BACK IN TONIGHT WITH GOOD LOW LEVEL JET 
RE-ESTABLISHING ITSELF FROM 06Z TO 12Z. BEST CHANCE AGAIN LOOKS TO 
BE ACROSS THE NORTH WHERE WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS AND KEEP CHANCE 
IN THE SOUTH. WITH GOOD SLY FLOW...WILL BUMP UP LOWS A LITTLE FOR 
TONIGHT. LOOKS LIKE PCPN SHOULD LINGER INTO SATURDAY MORNING ACROSS 
THE NORTH WITH CHANCE CONTINUING ACROSS THE SOUTH IN WARM SECTOR. 
LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES GIVING HIGHS IN THE 85 TO 90 DEGREE RANGE FOR 
SATURDAY. WILL UNDERCUT THIS A LITTLE BUT SHOULD STILL SEE PRETTY 
WARM TEMPS FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR AS GOOD WAA PATTERN CONTINUES. 

FRONT THEN SWEEPS ACROSS AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND WILL GO LIKELY POPS 
ENTIRE FA. LOOKS LIKE PCPN MAY LINGER INTO EARLY SUNDAY ACROSS THE 
EAST SO WILL MAINTAIN A LOW CHANCE POP THERE. IMPRESSIVE 925/850 
WINDS IN CAA PATTERN BEHIND FRONT. THINK WINDY CONDITIONS A GOOD BET 
SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTH.

UPPER AIR PATTERN HAS WESTERLY FLOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.  HEIGHT 
RISES WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AS A RIDGE BUILDS IN 
RESPONSE TO A TROF DIGGING INTO THE WESTERN CONUS.

SURFACE MAP FEATURES A WEAK LOW TRAVELING EAST ALONG STALLED OUT 
FRONT.  FRONT WILL DROP ONLY A BIT SOUTH TODAY BEHIND THE LOW AS IT 
IS NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE UPPER FLOW.  FRONT IS PROGGED TO RETURN 
NORTH BY FRIDAY MORNING AS THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS.  FRONT WILL 
REMAIN THE FOCUS FOR TSRA AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION.  

THOUGH THE FRONT WILL LIKELY STAY NEAR THE OHIO RIVER...DRIER MORE 
STABLE AIR IS PROGGED TO MOVE IN BEHIND THE LOW.  THEREFORE...ILL 
KEEP THE FORECAST DRY TODAY.  WITH A FEW UPPER AIR DISTURBANCES 
HELPING TO DESTABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE (2000+ CAPE) AS THE FRONT 
LIFTS NORTH TO LAKE ERIE AND STALLS...IT WILL BE PRUDENT TO LEAVE 
CHANCE TSRA IN LATE TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY.

AS PER GUIDANCE...I EXPECT TEMPERATURES WILL TOP OUT IN THE MID 70S 
TODAY...RISING TO AROUND 80 ON FRIDAY.  CLOUDS AND SCATTERED PRECIP 
WILL KEEP READINGS DOWN  BELOW 1000-850 THICKNESS-INDICATED 85 TO 88

CURRENT SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS LOW PRESSURE CENTER JUST W OF KGUS IN

PA WILL BE THE TRACK OF THE SFC LOW...AND MODELS ALL AGREE ON 
WEAKENING THE SFC PATTERN AS IT MOVES E THROUGH TIME. NOT MUCH TO 
SPEAK OF IN THE WIND FIELDS EITHER. 850 LOW IS ABOUT 60-100 KM N OF 
SFC LOW IN THE SRN GTLKS RGN AND ALSO WEAKENS AS ENERGY GETS 
TRANSLATED EWRD. THIS SETUP WILL ALLOW FOR SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT 
ALONG AND N OF THE BOUNDARY CURRENTLY OVER FCST AREA THIS EVENING. 
MOST MODELS SUGGEST THAT SFC FLOW PICKS UP EARLY TOMORROW FROM THE 
NW ON THE BACK SIDE OF SFC LOW. 

MESOETA HINTING AT SOME DECENT UPPER DIVERGENCE OVER NWRN CWA AROUND 
6Z TONIGHT AND THIS WOULD BE NOTED WELL WITH THE APPROACH OF 
CONVECTION FROM IWXS FCST AREA. LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING AND 
DYNAMICS SHOULDNT BE THAT BIG OF A FACTOR AS THE ATMOSPHERE IS 
QUITE MOIST ON THE SOUTH END OF THE FRONT AND 60S DEWPOINTS ARE 
PREVALENT ACROSS FCST AREA. THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING SHOWED PWATS AT 
1.17 AND ALMOST 700 CAPES WITH A -2 -3 LI. WILL CONTINUE WITH 
CURRENT FCST AND EXPECT MOST OF ACTIVITY TONIGHT TO BE IN NRN HALF 
OF FCST AREA. MESOETA SUGGESTING THAT VORT MAX WILL BE PRIMARY 
INFLUENCE ON CONVECTION IN THE NORTH...AND ITS LOCATED IN ERN CWA

MOIST WEST-SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT PERSISTS ACROSS OHIO VALLEY.  
VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE MOVING THIS WAY IS DEVELOPING A SURFACE LOW 
ALONG A STALLED BOUNDARY WITH PLENTY OF ASSOCIATED CONVECTION.  WITH 
THAT ACTIVITY APPROACHING OUR WESTERN FRINGE...1000-500 THICKNESS 
DIFFLUENCE...HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER...A LOW LEVEL WIND SPEED 
MAX...AND A SLOW MOVING BOUNDARY PARALLEL TO THE UPPER FLOW ALL 
POINT TO HEAVY RAIN EVENT.  THEREFORE WELL CONTINUE FLOOD WATCH.  

SEVERE TSRA WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY WITH INCREASING 
INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON.  WILL ISSUE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO 
HIGHLIGHT SEVERE THREAT.

WITH TSRA ON OUR DOORSTEP...100 POPS ARE APPROPRIATE FOR TODAY. 
CHANCE OF TSRA WILL LINGER INTO TONIGHT.  CONDITIONS WILL DRY OUT 
THURSDAY WITH RIDGE BUILDING IN BRIEFLY.  CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL 
RETURN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY LIFTS BACK 
NORTH AGAIN.  

WITH GUIDANCE IN GOOD AGREEMENT...HIGH TEMPS IN LOW/MID 70S LOOK 
GOOD FOR TODAY.  MODELS DIFFER FOR THURSDAY. A COMPROMISE BETWEEN

MOVING INTO AN UNSETTLED PATTERN FOR THE WEEK AHEAD. WEST SOUTHWEST 
FLOW WILL GET SET UP BRINGING A PARADE OF SHORT WAVES ACROSS THE 
REGION. 

FIRST SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS LATE TONIGHT BRINGING A WARM FRONT 
INTO THE SOUTHWESTERN ZONES BY DAYBREAK AND THEN LIFTING ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE AREA DURING THE MORNING. ELEVATED CONVECTION WILL OCCUR AHEAD 
OF THE WARM FRONT. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE DRAMATICALLY WITH 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES NEAR 1.5 INCHES. THUS HEAVY RAINFALL IS 
POSSIBLE. VERY STRONG WIND FIELDS WILL ALSO OCCUR WHICH COULD LEAD 
TO ROTATING STORMS. PRIMARY THREAT WOULD BE HAIL DUE TO THE ELEVATED 
NATURE OF THE CONVECTION.

EXPECT STORMS TO END FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE MORNING. BIG 
QUESTION IS HOW EXTENSIVE LOW CLOUDS WILL BE AND WILL THE ATMOSPHERE 
RECOVER FOR ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AFTERNOON. ALSO NOT MUCH 
FORCING IN THE LOWER LEVELS ALTHOUGH THERE IS ANOTHER SHORT WAVE 
PASSING THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON. ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT GET 
GOING IN THE AFTERNOON MAY CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING BEFORE MOVING 
OFF TO THE EAST.

DRIER AIR ALOFT WORKS IN MONDAY NIGHT WHICH WILL LEAD TO MUCH LESS 
CLOUD COVER. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN GOOD HEATING ON TUESDAY WITH 
TEMPERATURES UP AROUND 80. INSTABILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR 
ANOTHER ROUND OF DIURNAL CONVECTION.

A SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWEST ON TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND BRING MORE PRECIPITATION ON WEDNESDAY PRIMARILY FOR SOUTHERN 
ZONES. ANOTHER LOW WILL FOLLOW ON THURSDAY ALTHOUGH THIS SHOULD BE A 
LITTLE FURTHER NORTH RESULTING IN A FAIRLY GOOD CHANCE FOR ALL 
LOCATIONS. APPEARS THAT A BOUNDARY WILL REMAIN IN THE REGION THROUGH 
NEXT WEEKEND WHICH MEANS THAT THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

APPROACHING SYSTEM. ETA AND GFS IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT IN TIMING 
ONSET OF PRECIPITATION SUNDAY NIGHT AS WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH. 
EXPECT ATMOSPHERE TO BECOME UNSTABLE ENOUGH FOR THUNDER IN WESTERN 
ZONES LATE. SHOULD HAVE A PRETTY GOOD AREA OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE SUNDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. 

DRY SLOT WILL PUSH IN FROM THE WEST DURING THE DAY MONDAY ALLOWING 
THE ATMOSPHERE TO RECOVER AND BECOME QUITE UNSTABLE. APPEARS THAT 
ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP LATE IN THE AFTERNOON IN 
INDIANA AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT AND MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY 
NIGHT. WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE 
FORECAST FOR TUESDAY AS THE COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. 
EXPECT TUESDAY NIGHT TO BE DRY. BUT A WAVE WILL TRAVEL UP THE FRONT 
TO THE SOUTH AND BRING ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS ON WEDNESDAY.

HAVENT CHANGED TOO MUCH IN THE SHORT TERM. TWEAKED TEMPS DOWN A

IN THE 36-48 HOUR PERIOD. 

PRECIP POTENTIAL ON SUNDAY NIGHT IS DIFFICULT. HAVE JUST PUT CHANCE 
POPS IN ATTM AND FEEL THAT MODELS ARE ENTIRELY OVERDONE ON QPF 
FIELDS. WEVE HARDLY BEEN ABLE TO GET PRECIP WITH SOUTHEAST WINDS 
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS. DONT THINK THAT THIS WARM FRONTAL 
PASSAGE IS GOING TO BE ANY DIFFERENT, THOUGH THE LOW LEVELS ARE A 
BIT MORE MOIST THAN PREVIOUS WMFROPAS. 

MONDAYS TEMPS WILL BE ABOUT A CATEGORY WARMER THAN CURRENT FCST IF 
RAIN DOES NOT DEVELOP. THINK THAT THIS IS A REAL POSSIBILITY, BUT AM 
HESITANT TO BRING READINGS UP TO THE 80S AS SUGGESTED BY ETA. WILL 
EXPECT MID 70S SOUTHWEST TO AROUND 70 NORTHEAST UNDER MOCLOUDY 
SKIES. HAVE INCREASED LOWS ON MON PM TO AROUND 60 FOR MOST AREAS AS 
GFS IS SUGGESTING GOOD SLY FLOW OVERNIGHT. 

ON THE EXTENDED, HAVE DISCARDED THE GFS SOLUTION AND BROUGHT 
THINKING TO HPCS GRAPHICS FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS OF FCST. THIS 
BRINGS UP A SLIGHT CHANCE IN EASTERN FCST AREA OF SHOWERS (DONT 
THINK THAT THERE WILL BE THUNDER ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE COLD 
FRONT). LEFT THURS AND FRI DRY AS GRAPHICS SUGGEST HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING IN AND NOT THE SURFACE LOW OVER THE PLAINS AS DEPICTED BY 
GFS. 

WITH THIS IN MIND, TEMPS ARE A FAR CRY FROM GUIDANCE. HAVE BROUGHT 
HIGHS UP ON TUESDAY AHEAD OF THE FRONT TO THE UPPER 70S IN THE 
SOUTHEAST AND LOW 70S IN THE NORTHWEST. FAIRLY UNIFORM LOWS IN THE 
LOW TO MID 50S TUES PM, A COLD SHOT OF LOWER 60S IN THE NORTHWEST 
WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE FRONT WHILE SERN FCST AREA COULD BE WARM 
SECTORED TO BEGIN WITH. HAVE GONE WITH MID 70S FOR HIGHS HERE ON 
THIS DAY. 

AM NOT THAT CONFIDENT IN TEMPS AFTER THIS AS I DONT REALLY KNOW HOW 
STRONG THE COLD AIR PUSH BEHIND THE FRONT WILL BE. HAVE SET UP A 
NW-SE GRADIENT RANGING FROM THE MID 40S TO LOW 50S FOR WED PM LOWS. 

CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO SCOUR OUT ON THURSDAY THOUGH WERE STILL

BUT THOUGHT THAT COOL AND PLEASANT WAS THE WAY TO GO HERE. DROPPED

NORTH OF CINCINNATI. MEANWHILE COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM SOUTHERN 
MICHIGAN INTO NORTHERN ILLINOIS. LEADING EDGE OF CONVECTION IS STILL

STILL EXPECT COLD FRONT TO DROP INTO NORTHERN ZONES LATE THIS

FORECAST BY THE ETA. MODIFYING THE MORNING SOUNDING FOR EXPECTED 
MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE RESULTED IN CAPE AROUND 1000. LATEST RAPID

CURRENT SFC ANALYSIS SHWNG LARGE MCS EXTNDG ALONG FRNTL BNDRY FROM 
WESTERN LK ERIE ACRS LWR MI TO NORTHERN ILL SW INTO MISSOURI.  CLOUD 
TOPS ARE BEGINNING TO WARM A BIT AND CG LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE 
DECREASED OVER THE LAST HOUR.  HOWEVER...SOUTHERN EDGE OF CLOUD 
SHIELD WILL SPREAD ACRS WEST CNTRL OH OVER NEXT SEVERAL HRS.  SKIES 
WERE GENERALLY CLR ACRS REMAINDER OF FCST AREA ERLY THIS MRNG.  

FRNTL BNDRY IS THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE MORNING FCST PACKAGE...AS IT 
SLOWLY WORKS SOUTH ACRS THE REGION OVER THE NEXT 36 HRS.  GFS/ETA 
CONTINUE TO BE CLOSE IN MAIN FEATURES THRU FRI.  BOTH MODELS NOW 
INDCG A MORE AMPLIFIED UPR LVL PATTERN INTO FRI MORN AND THIS IS 
CONTRIBUTING TO HANGING UP THE FRNTL PASSAGE A BIT ON FRI.  GFS 
REMAINS ABOUT SIX HRS FASTER ON PASSAGE AND FEEL THIS IS A TOUCH 
FAST.  WILL CONTINUE WITH THE THOUGHT OF FRNT DROPPING ACRS FCST 
AREA DURING THE DAY FRI.

SVR THREAT INCREASING FOR AFTN ACRS FCST AREA...WITH MAIN FOCUS 
AGAIN ACRS NORTHERN 1/2 FCST AREA.  LEFTOVER BOUNDARIES AND OUTFLOW 
FROM MORNING MCS REMNANTS WILL COMBINE WITH DAYTIME SFC HEATING TO TRIGGER 
RAPID TSTM DVLPMNT BY LATE MRNG/ERLY AFTN ACRS WEST CNTRL OH.  
INCREASE IN LO LVL CONVERGENCE/LIFT AND UPR DIV SUPPORT BETTER 
ORGANIZED SVR STORMS THAN WED AFTN.  INSTABILITY VALUES ARE ALSO 
GREATER...WITH 2500-3500 SBCAPES AND LIS -5 TO -7 PROGGED BY MID 
AFTN.  ETA APPEARS TO BE UNDERDOING INSTABILITY ACRS NORTHERN ZONES 
THIS AFTN...AND THIS MAY BE IN RESPONSE TO THE MODEL INITIATING 
CONVECTION FASTER.  WB ZERO AROUND 9000 FT WOULD AGAIN SUGGEST LARGE 
HAIL TO BE MAIN CONCERN...WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND EMBEDDED WET 
MICROBURSTS ALSO A THREAT WITH TSTMS. PLAN ON MENTIONING SVR 
POTENTIAL IN NORTHERN ZONES AND WILL ISSUE AN SPS BTWN 09-10Z.  
RAISING TO LKLY POPS ACRS NORTHERN ZONES TODAY...WITH CHC POPS ACRS

INDICATED (GFS HAS ESPECIALLY HAD FEEDBACK PROBLEMS THIS WEEK)... 
SOLN SUPPORTIVE OF SVR STORMS TRANSITIONING INTO LARGE SCALE MCS 
OVERNIGHT WHICH SEEMS ENTIRELY POSSIBLE.  

RAISED POPS FOR FRI ALONG AND EAST OF I-71 TO LKLY WITH CHC FURTHER

DYING MCS CONTINUES ACRS SOUTHERN KY...WITH NORTHERN EDGE OF CI 
SHIELD GRAZING SOUTHERN 1/3 FCST AREA.  SWATH OF AC ACRS NORTHERN OH 
EXTENDING WEST TO IMPRESSIVE MCS OVER IOWA.

MOVEMENT OF FRNTL BNDRY AND EFFECTS THAT ITS LOCATION WILL HAVE ON 
WEATHER FOR OH VALLEY THRU FRI CONTINUES TO BE FOCUS OF MORNING FCST 
PACKAGE.  GFS/ETA IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT ON 00Z RUNS AND APPEAR TO 
HAVE CENTERED ON SIMILAR SOLN OVER NEXT 48 HRS.  FRNTL BNDRY WILL 
PUSH NORTH ACRS THE FCST AREA TODAY...LAYING WEST-EAST ACRS LOWER 
GRT LKS BY THIS EVNG.  CAN NOT RULE OUT TSTM CHC AS BNDRY LIFTS ACRS 
REGION...BUT WEAK MID LVL CAP IN PLACE SHOULD KEEP CONVECTION FROM 
DVLPG UNTIL THIS AFTN.  SPC HAS PLACED NORTHERN 2/3 FCST AREA IN 
SLGT RISK FOR SVR STORMS LATER TODAY.  MODEL SOUNDINGS INDCG 
ATMOSPHERE BECOMES UNSTABLE BY 18-20Z WITH CAPES 1000-1500 J/KG AND 
LIS BTWN -1 AND -3.  BEST LO LVL CONVERGENCE/LIFT REMAINS WEST OF 
FCST AREA AND LITTLE IN WAY OF UPR DIV.  THINK STRONG STORMS 
POSSIBLE WITH ISOLD SVR POTENTIAL GENERALLY ALONG AND NORTH OF 
I-70...BUT NOT EXPECTING WIDESPREAD SVR EVENT.  CONTINUING WITH 30 
POPS ENTIRE FCST AREA TODAY.

AS BNDRY LIFTS FURTHER NORTH TONIGHT...DRY SLOT WORKS INTO REGION.  
HAVE LEFT 30 POPS ACRS CMH/WAPOK AREAS BUT THAT IS PRIMARILY TO 
COVER ONGOING EVENING CONVECTION.  FEEL MOST OF THE NIGHT WILL BE 
DRY WITH SOUTHERLY FLO KEEPING CONDITIONS MILD AND HUMID.  ANOTHER 
WARM DAY FOR THURS AS BNDRY BEGINS TO SAG SOUTH INTO NORTHERN

FOR ENTIRE FCST AREA...WITH HIGHEST POPS ACRS NORTHERN COUNTIES.  
BNDRY LAYS OUT ACRS FCST AREA THURS NIGHT WITH BEST CHC FOR 
SHRA/TSTMS FOR REGION.  GFS SHWNG YET ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF ITS 
CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK PROBLEMS AT 06Z FRI BY SPINNING UP AN ODDLY 
INTENSE VORT ACRS WESTERN OH WITH 2-3 IN QPF ACRS FCST AREA.  FOR

GOING HIGH CHC POPS ACRS FAR SOUTHERN COUNTIES WITH LKLY POPS 
ELSEWHERE.  CONTINUING HIGH CHC POPS ALL LOCATIONS FOR FRI AS BNDRY 
SAGS SLOWLY SOUTH OF OH RIVER.  PCPN SHOULD SLOWLY END FROM NW TO SE 
LATE AFTN/ERLY EVNG.

TEMPS...HAVE AGAIN STUCK VERY CLOSE TO MAV GUID WHICH HAS BEEN CLOSE 
AS OF LATE.  BOTH GFS/ETA HAVE COME IN A BIT WARMER FOR TODAY AND

THE VORT MAX TO 24 AND TAKES IT FARTHER NORTH INTO OHIO...WHILE THE 
LESS CONTAMINATED ETA GIVES A 14 VORT TO KENTUCKY.  RESULTANT QPF IS

MODELS ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MAJOR FEATURES.  HOWEVER, 
THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE MESOSCALE.  THE MOST SIGNIFICANT 
IS THAT THE GFS TRIES TO HANG ON TO PRECIP LONGER THAN THE ETA.  
WILL ONLY ADJUST CURRENT TIMING BY SEVERAL HOURS.  WILL UP POPS 
TONIGHT AS THE BEST LIFT APPEARS TO BE AROUND 00Z.  WILL LEAVE 
MENTION OF THUNDER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 3/4 OF FA JUST NORTH OF

CUTOFF TO AN OPEN WAVE AS IT RUNS INTO RIDGE CURRENTLY OVER FCST 
AREA. PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THERES A DISTINCT CUTOFF OF NORTHERN 
EDGE OF PRECIP SHIELD NOTED ON ALL MODELS. WILL DROP POPS ACROSS THE 
VERY FAR NORTHWEST TO CHANCE AS I CANT REALLY SAY THAT RAIN IS 
LIKELY HERE. 

HPC LIKES THE AVN MODEL WITH THE MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK OF SFC LOW. AM 
NOT GOING TO SPLIT HAIRS HERE AS WE SHOULD GET A GOOD SHOT OF 
MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN SOMETIME FRI/FRI NIGHT. HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS 
FOR SHOWERS IN THE EAST ON SATURDAY MORNING AS AVN IS SHOWING SOME 
SHOWERS IN THE COLD SECTOR BEHIND FRONT. DONT SEE A WHOLE LOT OF 
THUNDER WITH THE UPCOMING SYSTEM AS H5 LOW CONTINUES TO DIMINISH IN 
INTENSITY. HOWEVER, CURRENT SAT/LIGHTNING PIX SHOW THAT THERE IS A 
GOOD BIT OF ACTIVITY IN AREAS THAT THE MODELS WOULD SUGGEST LITTLE 
OR NO. DONT AGREE WITH THE GENERAL THUNDER REACHING DAYTON AT 12Z 
TOMORROW AND HAVE KEPT THUNDER OUT UNTIL THE DAYTIME HOURS. 

FOR PRECIP TOMORROW, HAVE GONE CATEGORICAL IN THE SOUTH WITH CHANCE 
OF THUNDER...NO THUNDER IN THE FAR NORTH AND CHANCE POPS. AS H5 LOW 
OPENS UP, ANY INSTABILITY SHOULD BE OUT OF THE PICTURE BY THE 
EVENING HOURS. 

AVN TEMP GUIDANCE SEEMS WAY COLD TODAY. THIN CLOUDS WILL ALLOW FOR A 
GOOD AMOUNT OF HEATING THIS MORNING. WILL KEEP TEMPS WHERE THEY WERE 
WITH PREVIOUS FCST...MAYBE A DEGREE OR TWO LOWER TO COME INTO LINE 
WITH A BLEND OF FWC/ETA GUIDANCE. AFTER THE FIRST PERIOD, GUIDANCE 
VALUES ARE ALL WITHIN 2-3 DEGREES AT ANY PARTICULAR STATION. WILL

RADAR SHOWS THAT PRECIPITATION HAS JUST CLEARED THE FORECAST AREA. 
LOOKS LIKE EXTENSIVE AREA OF LOW CLOUDS ACROSS THE REGION WILL BE 
SLOW TO CLEAR. LATEST MODEL DATA SUGGESTS THAT THIS WILL START TO 
OCCUR LATE IN THE DAY. SO MAINLY CLOUDY FORECAST STILL LOOKS GOOD. 
BUT TEMPERATURES ARE STARTING OUT RATHER COOL AND ONLY EXPECT A 
SMALL RISE. MORNING SOUNDING SUPPORTED NEAR 50 WHICH SHOULD NOT BE A 
BAD MID POINT FOR THE AREA. HAVE LOWERED HIGHS A LITTLE BIT FOR THIS

BACK SIDE OF COLD POOL AND MOISTURE FEED WILL HIT FAR WESTERN (MOST 
OF IN COUNTIES) AND SOME NORTHWESTERN COUNTIES LATE TODAY. WILL HAVE 
SOME TYPE OF CLEARING WORDING FOR SKY CONDITIONS TODAY IN THESE 
AREAS, OTHERWISE PLAIN OLD CLOUDY FOR REST OF FCST AREA. TONIGHT 
CLEAR SKIES WILL WORK IN AND REMAIN THROUGH WED NIGHT WITH SOME 
INCREASE IN CLOUDS TO THE SOUTHWEST. THURSDAY SHOWS CIRRUS AND 
SEVERAL BANDS OF HIGHER RH AT H5 AND H7, SO WILL WORD AS PARTLY 
SUNNY OR VARIABLY CLOUDY. THURSDAY NIGHT WILL BE THE LAST PERIOD 
WHERE CLOUDS DONT DOMINATE AND I EXPECT THAT ONLY IN THE NORTHEAST. 
REST OF FCST (AT LEAST THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT) WILL BE CLOUDY. 

SHOWERS OVER FCST AREA ARE REALLY QUITE LIGHT. H5 VORT SHOULDNT 
PLAY ANY MORE INFLUENCE TO INCREASE COVERAGE OR INTENSITY DURING THE 
DAYLIGHT HOURS. AXIS OF COLD AIR IS IN EASTERN CWA BY 18Z, SO ANY 
SCT OR WIDELY SCT SHOWERS (MAY WORD AS SPRINKLES) SHOULD ONLY BE 
FOUND IN THE MORNING. 

WILL LEAN ON THE COOL SIDE WITH TEMPS TODAY BUT STILL BE RIGHT NEXT 
TO GUIDANCE NUMBERS. I COULD SEE A BIG DIFFERENCE AS THE ERODING 
CLOUDS IN THE WEST AND NORTHWEST WILL DEFINITELY ALLOW SOME OF FCST 
AREA TO BE WARMER. NUMBERS TONIGHT ARE ALSO CLOSE TO EACH OTHER 
ALTHOUGH THE FWC IS WAY TOO COLD FOR WEDNESDAY. I MAY LEAN TOWARDS 
THE NOTORIOUSLY WARM ETA GUIDANCE BUT MAKE SURE THAT ITS IN LINE 
WITH SURROUNDING FOS.

NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN EXPECTED TO BE FRIDAY...POSSIBLY LATE THURS PM.

WOULD LIKE TO HOLD BACK ANY PRECIP WED TO JUST THE WEST THIRD OF 
FCST AREA AND KEEP REST DRY OR SLIGHT CHANCE. I DONT THINK THAT 
SHOWERS ARE GOING TO SPARK IN THE WARM SECTOR UNTIL YOU GET SOME 
LIFT WITH A FROPA. WMFNT STILL WELL N OF FCST AREA BY 0Z THURS AND 
ILL BE BUMPING POPS TO LIKELY AS THE FRONT DROPS SOUTH THROUGH FCST 
AREA OVERNIGHT WED. EXCEPTION HERE WILL BE THE SOUTHEAST WHERE 
CHANCE POPS LOOK MORE REASONABLE BUTTING UP AGAINST RLX AND JKL.

ON FIRE WX FRONT, WILL KEEP THE WATCH FOR TOMORROW IN OHIO SINCE 
WINDS WILL STILL BE A FACTOR. THINK THAT THE 10 HR FMS WILL BE 
SIMILAR TO TODAYS VALUES AOB 8%, THOUGH THE RH WILL INCREASE AND 
RFW CONDITIONS WONT EXIST OVER IN/KY. 

GFS BRINGS IN TOO MUCH MOISTURE AND PWATS ARE WAY TOO HIGH BY 0Z 
THURS. PREFER TO USE THE ETAS .7 FOR ONSET OF PRECIP IN THE 
SUMMER-LIKE REGIME WERE UNDER. 

ON THE EXTENDED, WILL KEY OFF OF THE CANADIEN/UKMET AND EXPECT MORE 
OF A H5 RIDGE OVER FCST AREA THROUGH ABOUT 0Z MONDAY AFTER THE FIRST 
LOW PASSES THROUGH THIS WEEK. HAVE TAKEN A CLUE FROM HPCS 12Z 
FRONTS ON THE LAST FEW PERIODS AND WILL TREND TOWARDS THE WARM 
SECTOR UNTIL FRONT GOES THROUGH MONDAY. COOL BUT SEASONABLE AFTER 
THIS.

ANOTHER COMPLEX FCST IN TERMS OF CLOUD COVER AND CHC/S FOR RAIN OVER 
THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOURS.

SFC ANALYSIS AT 07Z DEPICTED AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OFF THE 
CAROLINAS.  AN INVERTED TROF EXTENDED FROM THIS LOW INTO THE UPR 
OHIO VALLEY.  THIS LOW PRESSURE WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A H5 UPR LVL 
CLOSED LOW OVER SWRN GA.

UPR LVL LOW WILL MEANDER SLOWLY NE THROUGH TODAY...BEING LOCATED

ACRS THE NORTH THIS AFTN...INDICATING IT COULD BECOME PARTLY 
CLOUDY.  FOR THE FAR SOUTH...SKIES SHOULD REMAIN CLOUDY DUE TO WRAP 
AROUND CLOUDS FORM THE UPR LOW.  TEMPS WILL BE HEAVILY CLOUD 
DEPENDENT.  CURRENT TEMPS RANGE FROM THE UPPER 20S NW TO THE MID 40S 
FAR SE.  IF THE NRN AREAS SEE SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON...THEY SHOULD 
BE ABLE TO MAKE THE LOWER TO MID 50S.  WILL BANK ON THIS ATTM.  FOR 
THE SOUTH...LOWER 50S SHOULD SUFFICE AS A 6 TO 10 DEGREE RISE IS 
PLAUSIBLE.  WILL KEEP A SMALL CHC OF RAIN IN  FAR SE SECTIONS CLOSER 
TO THE WRAP AROUND MSTR FROM THE UPR LOW.

FOR TONIGHT...WILL EMPLOY A TIGHT GRADIENT FOR POPS.  MODELS STILL 
SHOWING SOME PCPN SPILL OVER IN THE FAR SE ZONES.  FOR THE REMAINDER 
OF THE AREA...DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED.

AS THE UPR LOW PIVOTS NE ON FRIDAY...OUR AREA SHOULD SEE A GRADUAL

THE FORECAST WILL BE SOMEWHAT COMPLEX OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

UPR LVL LOW WAS DIGGING SE TOWARD LOWER MS VLY.  THE LOW IS ALREADY 
BEGINNING TO CLOSE OFF...WHICH MEANS THIS FEATURE WILL BE A SLOW 
MOVER FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.  850 MB TO 700 MB DEFORMATION ZONE 
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CURRENT PCPN ACRS MAINLY THE SRN FCST 
AREA.  DEFORMATION ZONE HAS SHOWN A TRANSITION FROM A SW TO NE AXIS 
TO MORE OF AN EAST TO WEST AXIS IN RESPONSE TO THE CLOSING OFF OF 
THE UPR LVL LOW.  EXPECT PCPN TO GRADUALLY SINK SOUTH OF THE OHIO 
RIVER THROUGH THE MORNING INTO THE EARLY AFTN HOURS.  THEREAFTER... 
WILL KEEP A LOW CHC OF RAIN IN THE FAR S.  SKIES SHOULD REMAIN 
CLOUDY TODAY.  TEMPS STRUGGLED YESTERDAY...SO AM GOING ON THE COOL 
SIDE TODAY...EVEN COOLER THAN MAV GUIDANCE.

FOR TONIGHT...UPR LVL LOW REMAINS OVER THE SRN STATES.  MOSTLY 
CLOUDY TO CLOUD CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL.  WILL KEEP SMALL CHC OF 
RAIN IN FAR SOUTH NEAR PERIPHERY OF UPR LVL LOW.

FOR THURSDAY...AM CONCERNED THAT ENOUGH LOW LVL DRY AIR MAY RESULT 
IN PC CONDITIONS IN THE NW...BUT A TOUGH CALL ATTM.  WILL KEEP SKIES 
MOSTLY CLOUDY AND LET DAY SHIFT SORT IT OUT.

AS UPR LOW PIVOTS NE TOWARD THE MID ATLANTIC STATES THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY MORNING...ERN CWFA MAY GET CLIPPED BY WRAP AROUND MSTR.  
WILL EMPLOY A CHC OF RAIN IN THESE LOCATIONS.

WARMER WEATHER IS ON TAP FOR THE WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER 
LVL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION.

.ILN...NONE.

RAIN HAS OVERSPREAD FA THIS MORNING BUT QPF AMOUNTS NOT NEARLY AS 
MUCH AS ADVERTISED BY MODELS. LOOKING AT AREA VWPS...LOOKS LIKE LOW 
LEVEL JET NOT AS STRONG AS FORECAST BY MODELS AND THIS HELPING TO 
CUT BACK ON PCPN AMOUNTS. STILL THOUGH...WILL CONTINUE WITH HIGH 
POPS EARLY TODAY AS SFC LOW RIDES UP OHIO RIVER VALLEY. TEMPS 
CONTINUE TO HOVER AROUND THE FREEZING MARK ACROSS THE FAR NORTH SO 
WILL HANG ON TO ADVISORY FOR MERCER...AUGLAIZE AND HARDIN COUNTIES 
THROUGH 9 AM.

DECENT DRY PUNCH MOVES IN ON BACK SIDE OF LOW LATE THIS MORNING AND 
INTO THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...WITH CONSIDERABLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
BELOW 850 MB...CLOUDY SKIES WILL PERSIST WITH A LINGERING CHANCE OF 
SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS OR DRIZZLE. WITH CLOUDS...WILL CONTINUE TO 
UNDERCUT GUID TEMPS FOR HIGHS TODAY. TEMPS A LITTLE TRICKY ACROSS 
THE FAR SOUTH AS WINDS SHOULD BRIEFLY SWING AROUND TO THE SOUTH AS 
LOW PASSES BUT STILL THINK TEMPS WILL REMAIN BELOW GUID NUMBERS. 
THINK CLOUDS WILL HANG IN THROUGH TONIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY AS 
FORECAST MODELS INDICATING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE PERSISTING IN THE LOW 
LEVELS. 

MID/UPPER LEVEL LOW FORECAST TO DROP DOWN INTO MID MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY THROUGH MID WEEK...KEEPING COOL CONDITION ACROSS OUR REGION. 
ETA TRYING TO BRING SOME PRECIP UP INTO SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF FA 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WED BUT GFS FARTHER TO THE SOUTH SO WILL MAINTAIN 
DRY FORECAST FOR NOW.

CURRENT TRENDS FROM THE RADAR INDICATE GFS AS THE MODEL OF CHOICE 
TONIGHT. EVEN THE ETA IS SHOWING A DRY PUNCH OVER WRN FCST AREA AS 
THE HEAVIEST RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE SFC LOW IN THE EAST IS A BIT 
DISJOINTED FROM THE UPSLOPE FLOW MOVING TOWARDS THE H5 CUTOFF IN THE 
WEST. GFS IS MORE PRONOUNCED WITH THIS DRIER (LIGHTER QPF) SLOT AND 
APPEARS TO HAVE THE BEST HANDLE ATTM. 

TEMPS LOOK TO BE AOA LOWS ALREADY AND HAVE MENTIONED STEADY OR 
SLOWLY RISING TEMPS FOR LOWS TONIGHT. PRECIP IN FAR NWRN FCST AREA 
MAY OCCUR AS FZRA...BUT READINGS ABOVE OR RIGHT AROUND FREEZING 
WONT ALLOW FOR THIS TO BECOME A WINTER WX EVENT. HAVE BUMPED TEMPS 
HERE A DEGREE FOR WHAT ITS WORTH. THE SNOW THAT WAS PREVIOUSLY 
MENTIONED HERE WAS TAKEN OUT AS MODEL GUIDANCE IS SHOWING A 
SIGNIFICANT WARM PUCH IN THE LOW LEVELS THAT WOULD HINDER ANY FROZEN 
PRECIP FROM REACHING THE GROUND. HAVE ADJUSTED THIS FOR TOMORROW 
ALSO. 

HAVE NOT GONE FULL SWING TO THE GFS, ESPECIALLY REGARDING TEMPS. 
BELIEVE THAT A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFS AND ETA IS APPROPRIATE FOR 
LOWS, LEANING TOWARDS THE ETA IN THE NORTH AND AN ETA/GFS COMPROMISE 
IN THE SOUTH. KEPT POPS 100 PERCENT TONIGHT.

ISC GRIDDS IN SOON AND MIS ALREADY OUT. ZONES OUT AT THE BOTTOM OF

MODELS ONLY SHOWING MINOR DIFFERENCES IN MOVING THE COLD FRONT 
ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. APPARENTLY JUST ENOUGH CONVERGENCE ALONG 
THE PRE FRONTAL TROUGH TO GET SOME CONVECTION TO DEVELOP IN INDIANA. 
BUT APPARENTLY CAP IS LIMITING THIS ACTIVITY. SUSPECT CAP WILL 
CONTINUE TO INHIBIT DEEP CONVECTION. MOST PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE 
POST FRONTAL WITH ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA GETTING RAINFALL. 

LOOKS LIKE THE RAIN WILL STILL BE ONGOING IN EASTERN ZONES EARLY IN 
THE MORNING. WILL HOLD ON TO A CHANCE IN MOST OF THE WEST. APPEARS 
THAT PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY IN THE MORNING. 

HAVE LEANED MORE TOWARDS GFS LATER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD AS ETA 
LOOKS OVERDONE IN THE AMOUNT OF UPPER TROUGHING. THIS RESULTS IN THE 
ETA SHOWING A SECONDARY WAVE INDUCING ADDITIONAL PRECIPITATION THAT 
SPREADS INTO SOUTHEAST ZONES SATURDAY NIGHT. HAVE KEPT THAT TIME 
PERIOD DRY. BUT COULD SEE SOME INSTABILITY SHOWERS ON SUNDAY AS 
UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. WILL ADD A LOW CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS DURING THE DAY. THERMAL PROFILES FAVOR SNOW UNTIL LOWEST 
LEVELS WARM ENOUGH FOR SOME RAIN IN THE AFTERNOON SO WILL JUST CALL 
IT A MIX IN THE FORECAST. 

RATHER DRASTIC CHANGE IN AIRMASS FROM TODAY. WENT WITH ONLY A 3 TO 5 
DEGREE DIURNAL RISE FROM EARLY MORNING LOWS SATURDAY. AFTER THAT 
GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS NUMBERS.

NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL START IN NORTHERN ZONES MONDAY 
NIGHT. STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION SHOULD RESULT IN ANY PRECIPITATION 
BEING RAIN SHOWERS. COLD FRONT WILL SAG SOUTHWARD ON TUESDAY AND 
STALL IN THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT BEFORE LIFTING BACK NORTH ON 
WEDNESDAY. HAVE KEPT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS WITH THIS FEATURE.

GRADIENT WILL PICK UP OVERNIGHT WITH GUSTY WINDS TOMORROW AHEAD OF 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO MILD LOW TEMPERATURES 
BUT AM A BIT CONCERNED THAT WINDS COULD DROP OFF ENOUGH IN THE 
EVENING FOR TEMPERATURES TO GET A LITTLE LOWER IN THE USUAL COOLER 
AREAS EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF COLUMBUS. SHOULD JUST BE SOME MID AND 
HIGH CLOUDS TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO 
SOAR INTO THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S BY MIDDAY FRIDAY WITH HIGHS 
TOPPING OUT ABOUT A CATEGORY HIGHER THEN THAT.

GFS SEEMS TO BE BETTER THAN THE QUICKER ETA WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE 
FRONT AND FORECAST FOLLOWS ALONG THOSE LINES. STILL LOOKS LIKE 
INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED WITH CAPE BELOW 1000 J/KG. IN ADDITION 
MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW SOME MID LEVEL CAPPING WHICH DOES NOT LOOK LIKE 
IT WILL ERODE UNTIL VERY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN UPPER HEIGHTS 
START TO FALL. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO OCCUR ALONG AND 
JUST BEHIND THE FRONT WITH ADDITIONAL SHOWERS EVEN FURTHER BEHIND 
THE FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. INSTABILITY SEEMS TO 
BE A LIMITING FACTOR IN SEVERE POTENTIAL LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND 
FRIDAY EVENING.

SHOWERS MAY STILL BE ONGOING SATURDAY MORNING ESPECIALLY IN THE 
EASTERN ZONES BEFORE CLEARING OUT BY MIDDAY. AFTER PRECIPITATION 
ENDS ONLY EXPECT A SMALL DIURNAL RISE FROM MORNING LOWS. COLD 
TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE ON SUNDAY AS UPPER TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS. 
THEN READINGS WILL WARM EACH DAY OF THE WEEK. NEXT CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION LOOKS TO BE FROM MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS A 
CLIPPER SYSTEM BRUSHES BY THE AREA. THIS WILL LEAVE A FRONT DRAPED 
ACROSS THE REGION AND THERE COULD BE A FEW MORE SHOWERS AHEAD OF

MAIN FCST CONCERN IS GOING TO BE TIMING AND SEVERITY OF NEXT SYSTEM 
MOVING THROUGH FCST AREA FRI PM. HAVE PUT POPS HERE TO CATEGORICAL 
AND TAPERED IT IN BOTH THE BEGINNING AND END OF THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD 
WITH CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. WILL PASS ON TO NEXT FEW SHIFTS 
REGARDING WIND POTENTIAL ON FRIDAY BUT DONT WANT TO GET THIS 
DETAILED THAT FAR OUT. 

HAVENT CHANGED AROUND TEMPS THAT MUCH BUT FEEL THAT THERE WILL BE A 
FEW DEGREES OF RECOVERY ON SAT EVEN WITH GOOD CAA EXPECTED. 

EXTENDED PERIOD LOOKS PRETTY CLEAR CUT AS GFS AND CANADIAN ARE IN 
DECENT AGREEMENT WITH PLACEMENT OF L/W AND EVEN S/W PATTERNS AS 
HIGHLY AMPLIFIED FLOW GETS PUSHED TO THE ATLANTIC AND REPLACED BY A 
ZONAL NW-W FLOW AT THE VERY END OF THE FCST PERIOD. UKMET SEEMS A

BIT MORE FAVORABLE.  SKIES MSTLY CLEAR ACRS FCST AREA AHEAD OF FRNT.

FIRST FCST CHALLENGE CENTERS ON FRNTL PASSAGE LATER TODAY.  FRNT 
LAYING OUT PARALLEL TO UPR FLO AND WILL TAKE ITS TIME CROSSING FCST 
AREA TODAY.  MUCH OF FCST AREA SHOULD START OUT MO SUNNY WITH SW LO 
LVL FLO.  MODEL SOUNDINGS INDCG SOME ENHANCED MOISTURE NEAR 5KFT 
THIS MRNG...BUT FEEL ANY CLDS THAT FORM AHEAD OF FRNT WILL DISSIPATE 
WITH GOOD MIXING IN LOWEST 5KFT.  CLDS WILL SLOWLY DROP SOUTH AND

LVL THICKNESSES/850 TEMPS WILL BE WARMER THAN MONDAY...PLAN TO RAISE 
HIGHS TODAY ACRS THE BOARD.  WARMEST TEMPS IN L70S FOR CMH/CVG/PMH 
ZONES WHERE MOST SUNSHINE EXPECTED.

TSTMS/SHRA EXPECTED TO DVLP ACRS WAPOK/DAY ZONES BY LATE 
MORNING/ERLY AFTN WITH AFTN TSTMS DVLPMNT ACRS REST OF FCST AREA AS 
GREATER SFC HEATING COMBINES WITH STRONG LO LVL CONVERGENCE AND

INTO THIS EVNG.  HOWEVER...NOT EXPECTING WIDESPREAD SEVERE WITH 
MARGINAL CAPES/LI VALUES AND WEAK LLJ.  UPR DIV ALSO MARGINAL WITH 
100-110 KT JET OFF TO NORTH OF REGION.  GOOD RAINERS WITH TSTMS AS 
PWATS CLIMB OVER AN INCH ACRS SOUTHERN 1/2 FCST AREA THIS EVNG FOR 
FEW HRS.  PCPN WILL GRADUALLY END FROM NW TO SE TONIGHT AS FRNT 
DROPS SOUTH OF OH RIVER.

HI PRES WILL BRING DRY WEATHER FOR MID WEEK.  WILL BUMP TEMPS UP A 
FEW DEGREES FOR WED AS GOOD DEAL OF SUNSHINE COMBINES WITH DVLPG WAA 
BY LATE DAY.  SHOULD BE BACK IN 60S ACRS MOST OF FCST AREA BY THURS 
AS WARM FRNT MOVES INTO UPR GRT LKS OF REGION AND SOUTHERLY SFC FLO

AT 01Z...A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM WRN MI...SOUTHWEST INTO NRN 
IL...THEN INTO CNTRL MO.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWED MOSTLY CLEAR 
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE REGION.

THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ERUPTED FROM MI THRU MO ALONG AND AHEAD OF COLD 
FRONT.  THE THUNDERSTORMS WERE THE RESULT OF UPR LVL DIV FROM THE RR 
QUAD OF 250 MB JET AND LOW LVL MSTR CONV AHEAD OF FRONT.

COLD FRONT IS STILL FCST TO MOVE FROM NW TO SE ACRS THE CWFA  
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT.  LOW LVL CONV AND UPR LVL DIV WILL BRING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE REGION.  FOR TONIGHT...CURRENT 
FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AT THIS TIME.  SOME LOW LVL CLOUDS AROUND 4 OR 5 
K FEET SHOULD FORM AFTER 06Z IN THE WEST AHEAD OF THE WAA ALOFT.  
PLAN ON KEEPING MOSTLY CLEAR ALL LOCATIONS EXCEPT THE FAR NW WHERE A 
SMALL CHC FOR SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED LATE.  LOW TEMPS 
IN THE UPPER 40S TO AROUND 50 ALSO SEEM GOOD AT THIS POINT.  MAY

AT 01Z...A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM WRN MI...SOUTHWEST INTO NRN 
IL...THEN INTO CNTRL MO.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWED MOSTLY CLEAR 
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE REGION.

THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ERUPTED FROM MI THRU MO ALONG AND AHEAD OF COLD 
FRONT.  THE THUNDERSTORMS WERE THE RESULT OF UPR LVL DIV FROM THE RR 
QUAD OF 250 MB JET AND LOW LVL MSTR CONV AHEAD OF FRONT.

COLD FRONT IS STILL FCST TO MOVE FROM NW TO SE ACRS THE CWFA  
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT.  LOW LVL CONV AND UPR LVL DIV WILL BRING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE REGION.  FOR TONIGHT...CURRENT 
FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AT THIS TIME.  SOME LOW LVL CLOUDS AROUND 4 OR 5 
K FEET SHOULD FORM AFTER 06Z IN THE WEST AHEAD OF THE WAA ALOFT.  
PLAN ON KEEPING MOSTLY CLEAR ALL LOCATIONS EXCEPT THE FAR NW WHERE A 
SMALL CHC FOR SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED LATE.  LOW TEMPS 
IN THE UPPER 40S TO AROUND 50 ALSO SEEM GOOD AT THIS POINT.  MAY 
MAKE LATE CHANGES TO ZONES.  FEELING IS THAT POPS NEED TO BE RAISED 
FOR TOMORROW FOR A MORE WIDESPREAD EVENT...AND WOULD WANT A QUICK 
LOOK AT THE FIRST 24 HOURS OF NEW ETA TO SEE IF TREND IS CONTINUING.

MORE OF THE SAME EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY WITH SC REMAINING ACROSS THE

SO FAR HAVE SEEN JUST ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST AREA. 
BUT CLUSTER OF STORMS WILL SOON BE MOVING IN FROM THE SOUTH WHILE 
BULK OF ACTIVITY HAS BEEN TO THE WEST OF THE AREA. PLENTY OF 
INSTABILITY AROUND WITH FAVORABLE WET BULB HEIGHTS SUGGEST SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH HAIL INTO THE EVENING. 

APPEARS THAT WEAKENING MCS WILL MOVE NORTHEAST UP THE OHIO VALLEY 
LATER TONIGHT AHEAD OF MAIN SHORT WAVE. EXPECT THIS TO BRING AT 
LEAST SOME RAINFALL TO THE ENTIRE AREA. THIS PRECIPITATION COULD 
LINGER INTO FRIDAY MORNING ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES. THEN COLD 
FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH DURING THE DAY. MIGHT BE SUFFICIENT LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY TO DEVELOP SOME SHOWERS ALONG THE 
BOUNDARY. HAVE GONE ALONG WITH WARMER HIGHS SUGGESTED BY ETA 2 METER 
TEMPERATURES.

MODELS DIVERGE A BIT IN TIMING OF THE NEXT CLOSED LOW MOVING ACROSS 
THE GREAT LAKES ON SATURDAY. BUT NO MATTER AS THE MAIN EFFECTS OF 
THIS SYSTEM SHOULD STAY NORTH OF THE AREA. NEXT CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION STILL APPEARS TO BE FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.

SERIES OF S/WS FORECAST TO PIVOT ACROSS AREA NEXT 24 HOURS AS UPPER 
LEVEL LOW OVER MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY PUSHES SLOWLY EAST. SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY SHOWN ON WV SAT IMAGERY CURRENTLY OVER EASTERN TN WILL LIFT 
NORTH THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON AND GRAZE EASTERN PORTIONS OF FA. 
EASTERN FA ALSO IN AREA OF DEEPER MOISTURE SO WILL CONTINUE WITH 
HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR THOSE AREAS THIS AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE...BROADER 
VORT AXIS WILL PUSH EAST ACROSS WESTERN FA THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON 
AND THIS REGION IN AREA OF BETTER INSTABILITIES WITH SFC BASED CAPES 
APPROACHING 1000 J/KG THROUGH MID/LATE AFTERNOON. 120 KT 3H JET ALSO 
MOVING ACROSS TN VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON WITH FA IN LF QUAD RESULTING 
IN SOME ENHANCED UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE ACROSS ENTIRE AREA. 
THEREFORE...WILL ALSO CONTINUE WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE 
WEST. 12Z ILN SOUNDING HAD WBZ AROUND 6000 FEET AND THIS WILL LIKELY 
RISE INTO FAVORABLE HAIL RANGE THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON SO INSTABILITY 
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO SUPPORT SOME HAILERS. WILL JUST MAKE

H5 PATTERN IS QUITE JUMBLED OVER MUCH OF CONUS FOR NEXT FEW PERIODS. 
ALL MODELS SUPPORT CUTOFF LOW OVER MO TO TRANSLATE ENERGY ALMOST DUE 
N AS IT HITS THE RIDGE EXTENDING FROM NEW ENGLAND TO THE ERN GTLKS 
RGN. THIS ENERGY GETS PICKED UP BY A DEVELOPING CUTOFF COMING IN 
FROM THE NRN PLAINS LATER TODAY. BY THE TIME THIS GETS SPUN UP ON 
FRIDAY, THE RIDGE HAS GONE WELL OFFSHORE AND THE LOW TAKES AN 
EASTERLY TRACK N OF THE OHVLY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

LAST S/W ROTATING AROUND THE LOW WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE SEEMS TO 
BE MOVING THROUGH FCST AREA FRI AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AFTER THIS, 
DRY WX SHOULD STAY IN PLACE OVER FCST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND 
EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK. GFS PAINTS SOME QPF OVER FCST AREA DUE TO 
CLOSE PROXIMITY OF STACKED LOW JUST TO THE NORTH ON SATURDAY 
EVENING, BUT IM GOING TO PLAY IT DOWN AND KEEP THE FCST DRY (MAYBE 
SPRINKLES 20 POP IN GRIDS). SUPPORT FOR PRECIP DOESNT SEEM TO BE 
THERE WITH UNIFORM WRLY FLOW AND LITTLE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH BEFORE 
HAND. THIS SOLUTION WORKS WELL WITH CURRENT FCST SO I DONT EXPECT 
ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TONIGHT FOR ANY PERIOD OF THE FCST.

IN THE NEAR TERM, IT LOOKS LIKE MODELS HAVE STRAYED FROM PREVIOUS 
FCST THOUGHTS. IF ETA IS CORRECT A SFC CONVERGENT ZONE (INVERTED 
TROF?) SETS UP SE OF FCST AREA AND FOCUS FOR SHOWER ACTIVITY MOVES 
UP THE SCIOTO RIVER VALLEY TOWARDS CMH BY 0Z TONIGHT. HOWEVER, I 
CANT SEE ANY LLVL SUPPORT FOR THE CONVERGENT ZONE AND THE WIND IS 
ACTUALLY STRONGER AWAY FROM THE BOUNDARY THAN IN IT. ON THE FLIP 
SIDE OF THIS, GFS AND NGM SUPPORT AN INVERTED TROF ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE SFC LOW OVER THE MIDWEST MOVING INTO SRN FCST AREA AROUND 0Z 
TONIGHT. MY THOUGHTS ON THIS IS THAT THE ETA IS WRONG AND THE 
NGM/AVN COMPROMISE IS RIGHT FOR TODAY AND THAT ERN FCST AREA WONT 
SEE MUCH PRECIP AT ALL. THE REAL RAIN WILL BE IN THE SOUTH LATER 
TODAY WITH APPROACHING INVERTED TROF. WILL COLLABORATE WITH 
SURROUNDING OFFICES AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT THEIR THOUGHTS ON THIS. IN 
ANY CASE, PATTERN IS A BIT TOO MUDDLED TO CLEARLY SAY RAIN OR NO 
RAIN SO CHANCE POPS IN MOST ZONES LOOK REASONABLE ACROSS FCST AREA 
WITH MAINLY AFTERNOON WORDING TODAY. 

ON TEMPS, WILL AGAIN LEAN TOWARDS THE ETA BUT HAVE WARMEST TEMPS IN 
THE WRN FCST AREA TODAY. MINS TONIGHT ARE CLOSE TO GUIDANCE, AND MAV 
IS JUST TOO COLD ON FRIDAY. HAVE LEANED TOWARDS FWC NUMBERS HERE OR 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE. HAVENT FIGURED OUT WHICH MODEL WILL BE BEST FOR 
FRIDAYS LOWS, BUT CURRENT FCST AND GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT GFS IS 
BRINGING IN TOO DRY AND TOO COLD OF AN AMS. FWC GOOD ON THIS PERIOD.

SFC OCCLUDED FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM NRN IL...THRU CNTRL IN (N/S) 
THEN INTO CNTRL KY.  CONVECTION OCCURRING OVER THE ERN CWFA WAS IN 
RESPONSE TO UPR LVL S/WV ENERGY.

ETA MODEL AND SATELLITE IMAGERY CONCUR THAT DRY SLOT BEHIND CURRENT 
S/WV SHOULD WORK INTO THE REGION OVERNIGHT...ENDING THREAT OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE ERN CWFA 
SHOULD END CLOSE TO OR ABOUT AN HOUR AFTER MIDNIGHT.  PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES WILL REMAIN.  MODIFIED RICHARDSON NUMBER INDICATES A MIXY 
ATMOSPHERE IN THE LOWER LVLS...SO AM NOT EXPECTING STRATUS TO FORM.  
SOME PATCHY FOG POSSIBLE IN SHELTERED LOCATIONS...BUT WIDESPREAD FOG 
IS NOT ANTICIPATED WITH SFC GRADIENT FROM THE SOUTHEAST REMAINING IN 
THE 5 TO 10 MPH RANGE.  OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL NOT STRAY TOO MUCH

SHOWERS ARE LIFTING NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. 
THUNDER IS JUST APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN ZONES AS INSTABILITY IS 
LIMITED. EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO MOVE OUT DURING THE EVENING. 
HOWEVER CANNOT RULE OUT SOME ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
LINGERING IN SOUTHEASTERN ZONES LATER TONIGHT. DRY SLOT SHOULD 
RESULT IN SKIES BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY.

REMAINING BOUNDARY WILL EXTEND FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TOMORROW AND THIS COULD BE THE FOCUS FOR 
SOME CONVECTION. HOWEVER AT THIS TIME MODELS ARE SUGGESTING THAT A 
WEAK CAP WILL PRECLUDE THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPMENT DESPITE MODERATE 
INSTABILITY. NONETHLESS WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE FOR AFTERNOON STORMS 
IN MOST PLACES. EXPECT A DECENT GRADIENT IN HIGH TEMPERATURES 
TOMORROW ACROSS THE BOUNDARY.

EXPECT CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS FURTHER WEST TO MOVE NORTHEAST INTO 
THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT BUT WEAKEN AS IT DOES. THEN MORE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED ALONG A FRONT THAT WILL SWING ACROSS THE 
REGION ON FRIDAY. WARMER TEMPERATURES SEEM TO BE BETTER RECENTLY BUT 
BELIEVE ETA MOS IS A LITTLE TOO HIGH SO HAVE GENERALLY COMPROMISED 
BETWEEN THE GFS AND ETA MOS.

FURTHER OUT IN TIME EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO 
NORMAL ALTHOUGH STILL A BIT ABOVE. BUT WILL HAVE A DRY FORECAST 
SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. NEXT SYSTEM WILL BE APPROACHING TOWARDS THE

THANKS IWX FOR COORD.

AM SHEEPISH ABOUT PREVIOUS FCST SINCE I ENTIRELY UNDER-ESTIMATED THE 
COLD FETCH OFF OF LERIE WITH GOOD NE WINDS. THIS WONT AFFECT FCST 
TODAY AS WINDS SWITCH E AND THEN SE, SO A GOOD WARMUP SHOULD BE 
NOTED FOR FOLKS IN THE NWRN FCST AREA. 

AVN GUIDANCE HAS BEEN ABOUT 10 DEGREES TOO COLD FOR THE PAST SEVERAL 
CYCLES (AT LEAST ON HIGHS). LOWS HAVE BEEN OKAY BUT LAST NIGHT WAS A 
BIT WARMER THAN EXPECTED. 

FOR TODAY, A ROUND OF SHOWERS WILL MOVE THROUGH FCST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON. WILL WORD ACCORDINGLY. A SECONDARY STRONG VORT SWINGS 
ALMOST DUE NORTH ALONG THE OH/IN BORDER OVERNIGHT. ALL MODELS HAVE 
GENERATED QPF WITH THIS BUT THE AVN IS ODD-MAN-OUT WITH PRECIP IN 
SWRN IN. WILL PLAY THIS ONE AS ISOLATED IN NATURE AND HAVE SCT 
WORDING IN FCST FOR WRN 1/2 OF FCST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. REST OF 
FCST AREA SHOULD HAVE ANY SHOWER ACTIVITY OUT OF RANGE BY MIDNIGHT 
AND WILL PROBABLY HAVE LIKELY OR HIGHER POPS FOR A PERIOD THIS 
EVENING. TOMORROWS LIKELY POPS SEEM OVERDONE. WILL SCALE BACK TO 
CHANCE FOR MOST OF FCST AREA...SLIGHTLY LESS IN THE SW. ETA IS MODEL 
OF CHOICE FOR ME TONIGHT REGARDING PLACEMENT OF PRECIP (IN CASE YOU 
HADNT ALREADY FIGURED OUT). AFTER THIS, WILL PLAY A MIDDLE OF THE 
ROAD OR WAIT AND SEE STANCE FOR PRECIP THURS PM AND FRI. CURRENT 
LIKELY POPS SEEM A LITTLE HIGH. WILL DROP TO HIGH CHANCE HERE WITH 
THE DIFFERENCES IN THE ETA/AVN SFC LOW PLACEMENT THE CULPRIT FOR 
DROP IN POPS.

SHORT WAVE AXIS EXTENDING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WILL CONTINUE TO

CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THE REST OF THE DAY WITH WEAK FORCING AT BEST. 
SPOTTY PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN PRETTY STATIONARY SO FAR BUT WITH THE 
CLOSE PROXIMITY WILL KEEP A LOW CHANCE IN FAR SOUTHERN ZONES. 
ELSEWHERE WILL LIKELY DROP MENTION. 

THE OTHER QUESTION IS WITH TEMPERATURES. MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED 
LOWER LEVEL THERMAL PROFILE VERY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY. HOWEVER 
CLOUDS ARE A LITTLE THICKER. UPPER 60S LOOKS REASONABLE IN THE SOUTH

MODELS IN PRETTY DECENT AGREEMENT IN BRINING A WEAKENING COLD FRONT

EXPECT THIS TO WORK INTO THE AREA TODAY. ALTHOUGH WHERE THERE IS 
CLEARING EXPECTED TO GET SCATTERED TO BROKEN STRATOCUMULUS TO

NEXT SYSTEM FOR MONDAY LOOKS LESS IMPRESSIVE WITH EACH MODEL RUN. 
THIS SHORT WAVE SHOULD AFFECT MAINLY THE SOUTHWESTERN PORTION OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. AND WITH THE MODELS SHOWING VERY DRY AIR IN THE LOWER 
LEVELS BELIEVE IT WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO GET ANY PRECIPITATION TO 
REACH THE GROUND. WILL JUST KEEP SOME AFTERNOON FLURRIES IN 
SOUTHWEST ZONES.

AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OFF TO THE EAST ON TUESDAY EXPECT TO SEE 
TEMPERATURES REBOUND QUITE A BIT. SO WHEN A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH 
THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT IT LOOKS LIKE ANY PRECIPITATION ALONG IT WILL 
BE IN THE FORM OF RAIN. ALTHOUGH AT THIS POINT WILL ONLY HAVE A LOW 
CHANCE. THE NEXT HIGH THAT FOLLOWS THIS FRONT DOES NOT LOOK AS

SWEEPING ACROSS THE REGION DURING THE EVENING. EXPECT A LINE OF 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT WITH JUST ABOUT EVERY LOCATION 
IN THE FORECAST AREA GETTING SOME PRECIPITATION. SO WILL GO WITH 
LIKELY PROBABILITIES BOTH THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY TONIGHT IN THE 
NORTHWEST. ELSEWHERE IT SHOULD JUST BE A CHANCE TODAY BUT 
CATEGORICAL TONIGHT.

HOW MUCH INSTABILITY WILL BE AVAILABLE IS STILL A BIT OF A QUESTION. 
ETA MODEL HAS BACKED OFF SOME IN THE AMOUNT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
THAT WILL MAKE IT THIS FAR NORTH WHICH IS LOOKING MORE REASONABLE. 
HAVE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD AND MENTION THUNDER IN ALL ZONES ALTHOUGH 
THE BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING THUNDER WILL REMAIN IN THE SOUTH. WITH 
SOME PRETTY GOOD LOOKING WIND FIELDS CANNOT RULE OUT ANY STORMS THAT 
DO DEVELOP IN THE LINE TO HAVE DAMAGING WINDS.

EXPECT PRECIPITATION TO END THIS EVENING BEFORE LOW LEVELS GET COLD 
ENOUGH TO GENERATE ANYTHING OTHER THAN RAIN. AIRMASS COMING IN 
BEHIND THE FRONT CONTINUES TO LOOK COLDER WITH EACH MODEL RUN. SO 
HAVE LOWER TEMPERATURES FROM TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. 

NEXT SYSTEM FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK IS HANDLED QUITE A BIT DIFFERENTLY

THE GFS SO HAVE GONE ALONG THAT DIRECTION. SURFACE HIGH WILL BE

FIRST CHALLENGE TO FORECAST CONCERNS STRATUS THAT IS RETURNING 
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE REGION ON THE BACK SIDE OF HIGH PRESSURE. 
CURRENTLY CLOUDS COVER ABOUT THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA AND 
EXTRAPOLATION SUGGESTS THAT THEY WILL SPREAD OVER THE REST OF THE 
ZONES BY DAYBREAK. NONE OF THE MODELS HAVE PICKED UP ON THIS SHALLOW 
MOISTURE BUT SUSPECT THAT STRATUS WILL BREAK UP BY MID TO LATE 
MORNING. THEN THERE WILL JUST BE SOME MID AND HIGH CLOUDS PASSING 
ACROSS MAINLY THE NORTH ASSOCIATED WITH A SYSTEM HEADED ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES.

MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT IN BRINGING A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE 
REGION ON SATURDAY EVENING. THIS IS A BIT FASTER THAN IN PREVIOUS 
MODEL RUNS. WILL ADD A CHANCE OF SHOWERS LATE SATURDAY IN NORTHWEST 
ZONES. WITH UPPER SUPPORT STAYING NORTH OF THE AREA WILL STICK WITH 
HIGH CHANCE PROBABILITIES ON SATURDAY NIGHT. BUT AT THIS TIME 
BELIEVE PRECIPITATION WILL END BEFORE ATMOSPHERE COOLS SUFFICIENTLY 
FOR SNOW. SHOULD BE A GOOD WARM UP AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON SATURDAY

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES WEAK HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION.  
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CLOUDS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN FA WITH A 
PATCH OF CLOUDS NORTH OF DAY AND CMH.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH HIGH WORKING OFF TO THE EAST 
BRINGING WARM AIR ADVECTION INTO FA.  ETA/GFS/UKMET ALL HAVE TIMING

GFS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT RUN TO RUN.  ETA HAS BEEN SLOWER FROM RUN TO

BUMP POPS UP TO 50% SAT NIGHT.  ELEVATED LIS GO BELOW ZERO WITH

TEMPERATURE FORECAST IS A TOUGH ONE WITH NEW SNOW COVER ACROSS FA.  
SNOW LINE APPEARS TO BE HAMILTON TO WILMINGTON TO CIRCLEVILLE.  
FRESH 2 TO 3 INCHES OF SNOW NORTH OF DAY AND CMH WILL KEEP TEMPS A 
BIT COOLER.  WILL CUT BACK ON TEMPS TONIGHT WITH CLEAR SKIES AND 
FRESH SNOW PACK ACROSS THE NORTHERN 2/3 OF FA.  HIGHS WILL DEPEND ON 
EXPECTED SNOW COVER WITH PLENTY OF WARM AIR ALOFT.  60S EXPECTED

SKIES MAINLY CLEAR ACROSS FA ATTM WITH LOW CLOUDS JUST ABOUT OUT OF 
EXTREME SOUTHEAST BUT SOME HIGH CLOUDS ALREADY SPREADING QUICKLY 
TOWARD FA FROM THE NW. 3H/5H MOISTURE FORECAST TO INCREASE THROUGH 
THIS AFTERNOON SO WITH ALLOW FOR MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES THIS MORNING 
THEN INCREASING CLOUDS NORTH/BECOMING PARTLY SUNNY IN THE SOUTH. 
WITH A COLD START THIS MORNING AND THEN SOME CLOUDS THIS 
AFTERNOON...TEMPS MAY STRUGGLE SOME DESPITE WEAK WAA DEVELOPING 
THROUGH THIS  AFTERNOON AND WILL GENERALLY GO WITH HIGHS RANGING 
FROM THE LOWER 20S FAR NORTH TO LOWER 30S IN THE FAR SOUTH. 

S/W ENERGY DROPPING DOWN ACROSS GREAT LAKES TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
WILL BRUSH FAR NORTHERN FA. WILL HANG ON TO A CHANCE OF SNOW AFTER 
MIDNIGHT FOR WAPOK AND NORTHERN CMH GROUPS WITH OTHERWISE MOSTLY TO 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS FA TONIGHT. WITH CONTINUED WAA...WILL 
ALLOW FOR STEADY OR SLOWLY RISING TEMPS TONIGHT. 

GOOD WAA TO CONTINUE ON TUESDAY AHEAD OF APPROACHING FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY AND WILL NUDGE UP TEMPS A BIT FROM CURRENT FORECAST WITH 
HIGHS IN THE 40 TO 50 DEGREE RANGE. FORECAST THEN BEGINS TO GET A 
LITTLE MESSY WITH ETA/GFS IN MAJOR DISAGREEMENT TUESDAY AFTERNOON 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. GFS STRONGER WITH NORTHERN STREAM SYSTEM... 
PUSHING BOUNDARY THROUGH FA FAIRLY QUICKLY. MEANWHILE ETA TRYING TO 
DEVELOP SFC LOW TO OUR SOUTHWEST AND MOVE IT NORTHEAST ALONG 
BOUNDARY...PASSING JUST SOUTH OF OUR FA. GFS SOLUTION WOULD RESULT 
IN LESS PRECIP AND WARMER TEMPS WHILE PERFECT PROG FROM THE ETA 
WOULD RESULT IN MAJOR SNOW ACROSS NORTHERN HALF OF FA FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. TO COMPLICATE THINGS...DPROG/DT PAST FEW RUNS 
VERY CONSISTENT IN THEIR SEPARATE SOLUTIONS FOR BOTH THE ETA AND 
GFS. 12Z UKMET TRENDING MORE TOWARD THE ETA SOLUTION WHILE 00Z 
CANADIAN LOOKS MORE LIKE THE GFS. 

BASED ON MAJOR DIFFERENCES...NOT SURE EXACTLY WHERE TO GO WITH THE 
FORECAST AT THIS TIME SO THINK BEST SOLUTION IS NOT TO DIVERGE TOO 
MUCH FROM CURRENT FORECAST...WHICH IS ACTUALLY A COMPROMISE OF THE 
CURRENT GFS/ETA SOLUTIONS. ONLY MAJOR CHANGE WILL BE TO HANG ON TO 
PCPN A LITTLE LONGER THROUGH WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY EVENING AS 
BOTH THE ETA AND GFS INDICATING PCPN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY BEFORE TAPERING OFF. ETA FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATING A 
POTENTIAL FOR SOME FREEZING RAIN ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
PORTIONS OF FA FOR TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL GO AHEAD AND INCLUDE IN THE 
GRIDS BUT WILL NOT MENTION IN ZONE FORECAST ATTM GIVEN HIGH DEGREE 
OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS SYSTEM.

AREAS OF SNOW PUSHING SLOWLY EAST NORTHEAST AROSS FA THIS MORNING. 
MOST AREAS GENERALLY PICKING UP A DUSTING ALTHOUGH CVG DID REPORT AN

AS WEAK SFC LOW LIFTS OFF TO THE NORTHEAST THROUGH 18Z. DO NOT 
EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATION BUT WILL PROBALY 
MENTION LESS THAN AN INCH FOR PMH GROUP BASED ON WHAT HAS BEEN 
OCCURRING UPSTREAM.

OTHERWISE...FAIRLY SHARP CUT OFF IN MOISTURE ACROSS THE FAR NORTH 
THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON WITH WAPOK GROUP RIGHT ON THE EDGE. BASED ON 
SAT PIX...AM LEANING TOWARD KEEPING THEM MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR NOW AND 
SEEING HOW THINGS PLAY OUT. OTHERWISE...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE HANGS IN 
PRETTY GOOD THROUGH THE DAY SO EXPCET MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY SKIES. 

DEEPER MOISTURE SPREADS BACK IN QUICKLY BY SAT AS WEAK S/W ENERGY 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR SAT 
INTO SUNDAY WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS ACROSS THE NORTH FOR SATURDAY 
IN AREA OF BETTER DYNAMICS. FORECAST SOUNDINGS AND CRITICAL 
THICKNESSES CONTINUE TO SUPPORT A MIX OF RAIN/SNOW ACROSS THE SOUTH 
WITH MAINLY SNOW NORTH. 

STRONG CAA KICKS IN THROUGH THE DAY ON SUN. DEPENDING ON EXACT 
TIMING...MAY ACTUALLY SEE FALLING TEMPS DURING THE DAY SUNDAY BUT 
FOR NOW WILL ALLOW FOR A BRIEF RISE EARLY AND INDICATE HIGH TEMPS.

AM A BIT PESSIMISTIC ON THE ADVISORY TO THE SOUTH AND WILL DROP IT 
WITH THE UPDATED PACKAGE. 

H8 TROF IS QUITE BROAD AND DOESNT SUPPORT A REAL FOCUS FOR 
PRECIPITATION UNTIL IT WRAPS UP IN EASTERN OHIO AROUND 6Z. CRIT 
THICKNESSES BARELY SUPPORT SNOW OVER THE FAR SOUTHEAST AT THIS TIME 
AND THEN COOL OFF BETWEEN 6 AND 12Z.

MAIN DELINEATION BETWEEN S AND R SEEMS TO BE WITH THE SFC DEWPOINTS 
WITH SNOW OCCURRING WHERE DEWPOINTS ARE AOB 30 DEGREES. RETURNS OVER 
FCST AREA CONTINUE TO DECREASE AS THE DRIER AIR IN PLACE WINS OUT 
OVER THE SLOWLY ENCROACHING MOISTURE. 

SOME AREAS TO THE SOUTH MIGHT CONTINUE TO SEE R/ZR THIS EVENING BUT 
THIS WOULD CUT DOWN ON SNOW AMOUNTS THAT I THINK ARE A LITTLE ON THE 
HIGH SIDE. WILL NOT CUT BACK ON POPS SINCE MAJORITY OF FCST AREA 
WILL SEE SOME SNOW OUT OF THIS SYSTEM AND A WIDESPREAD INCH LOOKS TO

FIRST FORECAST PROBLEM WILL BE FORECASTING TONIGHT/S LOWS.  
CURRENTLY...TEMPS ARE COLD...RANGING FROM THE MID TEENS NORTH TO THE 
MID 20S SOUTH.  SOME MID AND HIGH LVL CLOUDINESS WAS NOTED OVER THE 
SOUTHERN AND EASTERN CWFA...WITH MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS ELSEWHERE.  
MID AND HIGH LVL CLOUDINESS WILL DECREASE OVER THE SE CWFA THIS

AHEAD OF A S/WV NOW OVER MN/IOWA.  AS A RESULT...TEMPS WILL 
DROP...REBOUND...AND POSSIBLY DROP AGAIN ACRS THE REGION OVERNIGHT
DUE TO THE VARYING AMOUNTS OF CLOUD COVER.  WILL DO MY BEST AND GO 5 
TO 10 FAR NW TO 15 TO 20 IN THE FAR SOUTHEAST.

REGION WILL CONTINUE UNDER A WEST TO SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THROUGH 
THE END OF THE WEEK.  EMBEDDED SHORTWAVES OF VARYING STRENGTH WILL 
BE HARD TO TIME...ESPECIALLY THEIR ASSOCD CLOUD COVER.  ONE S/WV 
WILL PASS ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER ON WEDNESDAY...BRINGING 
A SMALL CHANCE OF LIGHT SNOW THERE.  A STRONGER S/WV IS POISED TO 
MOVE INTO TN/KY ON THURSDAY AND OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT.  THE PLACEMENT OF THIS SHORTWAVE AND ITS SURFACE 
REFLECTED INVERTED TROF HAS BEEN MOST CONSISTENT ON THE GFS (WHICH 
IS USUALLY THE CASE SINCE THIS MODEL IS A SPECTRAL MODEL AND NOT A 
GRIDDED MODEL LIKE THE ETA...HANDLING PLACEMENT OF SYNOPTIC FEATURES 
BETTER) THAN THE ETA.  TRENDS...HOWEVER...HAVE SHOWN IT MORE SHEARED

ACRS THE CVG...CMH AND PMH REGIONS ON THURSDAY.

LATEST GFS NOW HAS A S/WV MOVING INTO THE OHIO VLY ON SATURDAY.  
HAVE NOT SEEN THIS IN PREVIOUS RUNS...SO WILL LEAVE FORECAST DRY AS 
OF NOW...WAITING TO SEE IF THIS CONTINUES IN FUTURE RUNS.

LONG RANGE MODELS ALL AGREE WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE

WITH BROAD TROF OVER EASTERN CONUS...UPPER FLOW IS WESTERLY ABOVE 
ILN CWA.  FLOW WILL PERSIST FOR THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.

SURFACE HIGH MOVING THROUGH WESTERLY UPPER FLOW WILL BE THE MAIN 
FACTOR IN THE REGIONS WEATHER THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  GFS HAS HIGHS 
CURRENT POSITION BETTER THAN ETA. 

DETERMINING SKY CONDITION IS TODAYS MAIN CONCERN.  MID AND HIGH 
CLOUDS WILL BE AROUND IN OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES EARLY TODAY UNTIL 
SHEARED OUT VORT MAX MOVES THROUGH BY LATE MORNING.  IN THE 
SOUTH...SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY EARLY...PARTLY CLOUDY BY THIS 
AFTERNOON.  NORTHERN COUNTIES WILL REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY UNTIL EARLY 
EVENING WHEN MORE MID LEVEL CLOUDS ARRIVE AHEAD OF ANOTHER VORT 
MAX.  MID LEVEL MOISTURE IS THEN PROGGED TO OVERSPREAD THE AREA...SO 
I EXPECT SKIES WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY ALL ZONES TONIGHT.

SURFACE TROF APPROACHING THE OHIO RIVER ON WEDNESDAY IS WEAKER AND 
DRIER THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS.  IT APPEARS THAT THE TROF WILL BRING 
A CHANCE OF SNOW ONLY TO OUR SOUTHEAST COUNTIES...SO ILL REMOVE 
CHANCE POPS FROM THE CINCINNATI GROUP.  SKIES SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY 
CLOUDY IN OUR SOUTHEAST ON WEDNESDAY...WITH PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS 
FOR THE REST OF THE AREA. 

NEXT CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIP WILL BE THURSDAY WHEN A STRONGER 
TROF PASSES SOUTH.  TEMPS TO REMAIN COLD SO SNOW IS LIKELY TO BE 
MAIN FORM OF PRECIP.  LOWER QPF INDICATED ON GFS MAKES SENSE IN 
SHEARED OUT WESTERLY FLOW.

COMPACT...BUT POTENT WEATHER SYSTEM...IS STILL ON TRACK FOR THE OHIO

IS FAIRLY CLOSE TO 18Z ETA AND 00Z RUC.  SFC LOW WILL BE ASSOCD WITH 
STRONG WAA/ISENTROPIC LIFT...COMBINED WITH DIV ALOFT FROM STRONG 
DPVA.  LOOKING AT THE 18Z ETA...18Z GFS AND 00Z RUC...THE ETA IS A 
LITTLE STRONGER WITH THE SFC LOW (ABOUT 3 OR 4 MB) THAN THE OTHER 
TWO MODELS.  AS A RESULT...IT TAKE THE LOW ON A SLIGHTLY (BUT 
IMPORTANT) NW TRACK FROM NEAR OWENSBORO KY AT 09Z TO OWENTOWN KY BY 
12Z...THEN NEAR LOGAN OH BY 15Z.  THE RUC AND GFS...ON THE OTHER

SOMEWHAT AS IT MOVES EAST STILL LOOKS LIKE IMPRESSIVE FORCING WHICH 
SHOULD RESULT IN A BAND OF MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOW NORTH OF THE 
SURFACE LOW. IT APPEARS THAT THE LOW WILL MOVE ACROSS NORTHERN 
KENTUCKY INTO SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO. ALTHOUGH SNOW SHOULD NOT LAST

THERE WILL BE A FAIRLY SHARP GRADIENT ON THE SOUTHERN EDGE. IN

WARMING UP ENOUGH FOR ALL RAIN IN THE FAR SOUTHEAST COUNTIES.

BELIEVE EVENT WILL BE OVER BY MIDDAY. THEN COLDER AIR WILL BUILD

CONVECTION IN DRY SLOT IS CURRENTLY MOVING UP INTO SOUTHEASTERN 
ZONES. BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THIS WILL BE THROUGH THAT AREA WITHIN THE 
NEXT HOUR OR TWO. SO TENTATIVELY PLAN ON ENDING FLOOD WATCH WITH THE 
NEW FORECAST.

FOCUS THEN TURNS TO WINTER WEATHER. MODELS SUGGEST A CHANGE OVER TO 
SNOW IN THE NORTHWEST IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THE CHANGE SHOULD SWEEP 
ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE EVENING POSSIBLY NOT SWITCHING TO SNOW 
NEAR PORTSMOUTH UNTIL JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT. GOOD AREA OF MID LEVEL 
FRONTOGENESIS WILL CLIP THE NORTHWESTERN ZONES THIS EVENING. PLAN TO 
CONTINUE WITH 3 TO 5 INCHES ACCUMULATION BUT WILL INCLUDE THE NEXT 
TIER OF COUNTIES IN THAT AS WELL. ZONE OF DEFORMATION WILL QUICKLY 
MOVE ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA OVERNIGHT WITH ACCUMULATIONS IN THE 
ADVISORY RANGE STILL LOOKING REASONABLE FOR MOST PLACES. ONLY 
EXCEPTION WILL BE IN THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES.

LOOKS LIKE SNOW MAY NOT END IN EASTERN ZONES UNTIL AFTER DAYBREAK SO 
WILL KEEP A CHANCE GOING THERE EARLY. THEN FOCUS TURNS TO NEXT QUICK 
MOVING SYSTEM. LOOKS LIKE THIS WILL SPREAD SNOW INTO THE AREA AFTER 
MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT AND BE MOVING OFF TO THE EAST ON MONDAY 
MORNING. AT THIS TIME WILL KEEP ACCUMULATIONS BELOW 4 INCHES. 
THERMAL PROFILES IN SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO AND NORTHEAST KENTUCKY

SNOW IN THE NORTHWEST IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THE CHANGE SHOULD SWEEP 
ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE EVENING POSSIBLY NOT SWITCHING TO SNOW 
NEAR PORTSMOUTH UNTIL JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT. GOOD AREA OF MID LEVEL 
FRONTOGENESIS WILL CLIP THE NORTHWESTERN ZONES THIS EVENING. PLAN TO 
CONTINUE WITH 3 TO 5 INCHES ACCUMULATION BUT WILL INCLUDE THE NEXT 
TIER OF COUNTIES IN THAT AS WELL. ZONE OF DEFORMATION WILL QUICKLY 
MOVE ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA OVERNIGHT WITH ACCUMULATIONS IN THE 
ADVISORY RANGE STILL LOOKING REASONABLE FOR MOST PLACES. ONLY 
EXCEPTION WILL BE IN THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES.

LOOKS LIKE SNOW MAY NOT END IN EASTERN ZONES UNTIL AFTER DAYBREAK SO 
WILL KEEP A CHANCE GOING THERE EARLY. THEN FOCUS TURNS TO NEXT QUICK 
MOVING SYSTEM. LOOKS LIKE THIS WILL SPREAD SNOW INTO THE AREA AFTER 
MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT AND BE MOVING OFF TO THE EAST ON MONDAY 
MORNING. AT THIS TIME WILL KEEP ACCUMULATIONS BELOW 4 INCHES. 
THERMAL PROFILES IN SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO AND NORTHEAST KENTUCKY 
SUGGEST THAT PRECIPITATION WILL FALL AS A WINTRY MIX.

THANKS TO CLE FOR COORD.

UGLY FORECAST IN THE WORKS TODAY. FIRST CONCERN IS FREEZING RAIN 
POTENTIAL IN THE NORTHWEST TONIGHT. EXPECT THE HEAVY RAIN TO COME 
WITH THE WARMER AIR AND THE APPROACH OF THE H8 LOW. 1/4 RAIN IS 
POSSIBLE BUT WONT BE ALL FREEZING. I BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE A 
QUICK TURN AROUND TO REGULAR RAIN EARLY SATURDAY WITH THE HEAVIER 
QPF. ADVISORY TONIGHT IS PRUDENT WITH 1/10 NOTED BY 12Z. TEMPS WILL 
BE AOB 32 HERE UNTIL DAYBREAK SATURDAY. TEMP CUTOFF IS PRETTY 
EXTREME AND I THINK THAT ONLY HALF OF THE ADVISORY AREA HAS 
POTENTIAL FOR ICING PROBLEMS BUT HAVE ADDED A TIER OF COUNTIES DUE 
TO UNCERTAINTY OF FCST. 

NEXT IS POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING. ATTM, SNOW PACK SHOULD HELP ABSORB 
SOME QPF ON SAT AND DELAY SOME RUNOFF, BUT WILL INCLUDE HEAVY RAIN 
WORDING AND PONDER WHETHER COUNTY FLOOD WARNINGS WILL BE ISSUED 
VERSUS RIVER FLOODING AFTER THE RAIN EVENT. ATTM, WERE COVERED BY 
THE ESF AND FFGUIDANCE IS STILL ON THE HIGH SIDE WITH A GENERAL 2 6 
HOUR VALUE. WILL HOLD OFF ON A WATCH BUT PASS ON THE POSSIBILITY TO 
NEXT SHIFT. IN/KY COUNTIES ARE A LITTLE LOWER ON FFGUIDANCE, BUT 
ALSO HAVE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS SNOW PACK. 

COLD POOL ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW WILL BE GOOD TO CHANGE ALL 
PRECIP IN FCST AREA TO SNOW BY MIDNIGHT. HOWEVER, SNOW POTENTIAL 
DECREASES SW-NE THROUGH THE NIGHT AS MOISTURE MOVES OUT OF THE AREA. 
A FEW INCHES ARE POSSIBLE IN THE NORTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES BUT 
NOTHING MAJOR IS EXPECTED TO WARRANT ANY KIND OF HEADLINE. REST OF 
CWA WILL SEE TRACE TO 1/2 ACCUM.

WILL BLEND TEMPS FROM THE ETA/GFS THROUGH THE FIRST SEVERAL PERIODS

EXPECT RAIN TO BEGIN TO SLOWLY OVERSPREAD OUR FA THIS MORNING AS 
WELL DEFINED AREA OF LOWER LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT MOVES NORTH. BEST 
SUPPORT WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL IMPACT OUR AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND

CHANGE TO SNOW FROM W-E ACROSS OUR AREA. FEEL THE BEST DYNAMICS FOR 
SNOW WILL BE NW AND N OF OUR AREA AS AXIS OF STRONG FRONTOGENESIS 
SHIFTS NEWARD...WELL NW OF OUR AREA. AS AXIS OF MID-LEVEL 
DEFORMATION AND WK QG FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH THE WRAP AROUND 
MOISTURE MOVE ACROSS OUR AREA...FEEL SOME SNOW ACCUMULATION 
POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS W-CTRLY OHIO ON SATURDAY NIGHT. CURRENT 
THINKING IS FOR AMOUNTS TO BE LESS THAN WARNING CRITERIA...BUT WILL 
CONTINUE TO MONITOR.

SUNDAY NIGHTS SYSTEM CONTINUES TO TREND COLDER. TRENDS SUPPORT A

WEAK INVERTED TROF OVER SERN FCST AREA WITH SW-NE ORIENTATION WILL 
BE THE FOCUS FOR A WMFNTL BOUNDARY AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP BEGINNING 
TOMORROW OVER THE FAR SOUTH. SFC LOW WILL TRACK ALONG THE BOUNDARY 
AND HEAVIEST PRECIP WILL BE JUST NNW OF THE TRACK OF THE LOW. 

TONIGHT I EXPECT ANOTHER ROUND OF MORNING FOG, ESPECIALLY IN THE 
SOUTHEAST ALONG THE TROF WHERE LLVL CLOUDS HAVE LINGERED INTO THIS 
AFTERNOON, MAINLY SRN FCST AREA. HOWEVER, LOOKING UPSTREAM, 
THERES A DEFINITE CUTOFF FROM THE AXIS OF THE HIGH PRESSURE WITH 
LITTLE TO NO LLVL CLOUDS ALONG AND JUST S OF THE RIDGE. 

HOWEVER, MODELS HAVE BEEN JUMPING AROUND WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM 
APPROACHING OHVLY FROM THE GULF EARLY THIS WEEKEND. GFS IS TRENDING 
FASTER AND PER THE PMDHMD DISCUSSION ILL GO WITH A PRIMARILY ETA 
SOLUTION WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM. WOULD LIKE TO GO CATEGORICAL POPS 
FOR A POINT IN TIME HERE, BUT DIFFERENCES IN MODELS SUGGEST A LITTLE 
CAUTION. HAVE BUMPED LIKELY TO THE HIGHER END AND WILL LEAVE IT 
THERE FOR NOW. 

RAIN WILL EXPERIENCE A QUICK AND SIGNIFICANT CHANGEOVER TO SNOW ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT AS STRONG CAA ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW RACES IN. 
AMOUNTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT OVER NRN CWA...AND H9 JET OF 40KT IN THE 
CAA WILL LEAD TO A SERIOUS REDUCTION IN VSBYS WITH THE SNOW. 
HOWEVER, THE PROFOUND DIFFERENCES IN THE SHORT TERM WILL LIMIT THE 
CONFIDENCE IN THIS PERIOD OF THE FCST AND WILL JUST HAVE THE LIKELY 
TO CATEGORICAL RAIN CHANGE TO LIKELY SNOW WITH ACCUMS POSSIBLE. 

NO BIG CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED. WENT TOWARDS A GFS (ALBEIT SLOWER

NEXT SYSTEM HAS SLOWED DOWN...SO WILL GO MOSTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE

12Z ETA AND 12Z GFS HAVE TRENDED FARTHER SOUTH WITH POSITION OF

THAT ALL THE RAIN WILL STAY IN THE SOUTHEAST...WITH THE NORTHWEST 
REMAINING DRY.  WILL STRATIFY THE POPS FROM LOW CHANCE IN THE

WESTERN KY AND SOUTHERN ILLINOIS IN AREA OF NICE 290K ISENTROPIC

ACRS CNTRL ILL OVER LAST 2-3 HRS.  RADAR ECHOES SLOWLY OVERSPREADING 
SW FCST AREA...BUT FAIRLY DRY AT 850 MB AND WILL TAKE A FEW HRS TO 
MOISTEN UP.

FCST CHALLENGES FOR THIS PACKAGE INCLUDE FRNTL BNDRY AND PCPN 
TODAY...AND LOOKING AHEAD TO ANOTHER BIG STORM FOR THE WEEKEND.  
GFS/ETA IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SYSTEM FOR TODAY.  HAVE ELECTED TO 
KEEP WINTER WX ADV FOR -FZRA UP FOR SW COUNTIES AND SOUTHERN

FZRA/SN MIX CHANGING TO -SN BEFORE ENDING IN AFTN.  CUT BACK ON 
NORTHERN EXTENT OF ADVISORY BASED ON CURRENT RADAR AND MODEL 
TRENDS.  ADVISORY WILL BE FROM I-70 SOUTH ACRS DAY/CVG ZONES.

FURTHER EAST...PCPN ONSET LIKELY TO HOLD OFF UNTIL LATE MRNG/NOON 
WHICH SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS OVER PMH AREA TO GET BACK TO 32F.  CAA 
PATTERN DVLPG BY 18Z WITH FRNTL PASSAGE...AND THINK PCPN WILL 
CHANGEOVER TO -SN ACRS SOUTHERN COUNTIES BEFORE ENDING THIS EVNG.  
MODEL SOUNDINGS SUPPORT THIS THINKING.  LKLY POPS ACRS SOUTHERN 2/3 
FCST AREA...CHC POPS ACRS NORTH.

HI PRES BUILDS IN THIS EVNG WITH CLRNG SKIES BEHIND FRNTL BNDRY.  LO 
LVL MOISTURE TRYING TO HANG BACK ACRS FAR SOUTH AND LIKELY NOT TO 
KICK IT OUT UNTIL THURS.  THURS STILL APPEARS TO BE BEST DAY OF WEEK 
FOR REGION WITH GOOD DEAL OF SUNSHINE AND HI PRES OVERHEAD.

WEEKEND STORM CONTINUING SLOWING TREND AND MORE SOUTHERLY SOLN.  ALL 
MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON TIMING AND PLACEMENT AS STRONG SFC LO 
DVLPS OVER GULF COAST REGION AND TRACKS INTO KY/W VA BY SAT NIGHT.  
LARGE QPF AMOUNTS (1.5-2 IN) SPREADING INTO OH VALLEY FRI NIGHT THRU 
SAT...AND FLOODING CONCERNS GROWING.  WILL SEND OUT ESF TO HIGHLIGHT 
POTENTIAL FLOODING THREAT THIS WEEKEND.  ANOTHER THING TO CONSIDER 
IS FASTER CHANGEOVER TO SNOW DURING DAY SATURDAY.  BOTH GFS/ETA KEEP 
LOWER LVLS WARM ENOUGH FOR RAIN THRU MUCH OF SATURDAY...EVEN WITH 
MORE SOUTHERN SOLN.  MODELS MAY NOT BE TAKING INTO ACCOUNT DEEP SNOW 
COVER ALREADY ON GROUND FROM THIS PAST WEEKEND...WHICH WOULD SERVE 
TO KEEP BOUNDARY LAYER COLDER THAN GUID INTO SATURDAY.  WILL 
CONTINUE TO MONITOR.

DRY SLOT HAS WORKED UP INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. THIS 
APPEARS TO BE FILLING IN SOMEWHAT BUT WIT LIGHTER PRECIPITATION. 
APPEARS THAT BAND OF HEAVIER PRECIPITATION FROM SOUTHERN INDIANA 
INTO CENTRAL OHIO IS ON THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE 850 MB 
FRONTOGENESIS. THIS FORCING WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING BEFORE 
WEAKENING. BELIEVE THAT THERE COULD BE A BAND OF HEAVY SNOW FROM 
EAST CENTRAL INDIANA INTO CENTRAL OHIO TONIGHT. EXPECT TO PUT 2 TO 5 
INCHES IN THE FORECAST. TO THE NORTH OF THIS BAND EXPECT ONLY 1 TO 3.

TO THE SOUTH OF THIS BAND EXPECT A CONTINUED MIX OF PRECIPITATION 
PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
SUGGEST THAT BY THE TIME ALL WARM LAYERS HAVE ERODED THERE WILL BE 
DRYING ALOFT. THIS DRYING WILL CAUSE A LOSS OF ICE CRYSTAL 
FORMATION. SO ADDITIONAL PRECIPITATION GENERATION WILL BE IN THE 
FORM OF DROPLETS. THE LOWER LEVELS LOOKS COLD ENOUGH AND DEEP ENOUGH 
FOR THE DROPLETS TO FREEZE BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND WHICH WOULD BE 
SLEET FOR MUCH OF SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO. FURTHER SOUTH 
BELIEVE THAT THE PRECIPITATION TYPE WOULD BE PREDOMINANTLY FREEZING 
RAIN. CANNOT RULE OUT A PERIOD IN THE EVENING WHERE THERE WILL BE 
SOME SNOW DURING THIS TRANSITION IN PRECIPITATION GENERATION.

SINCE THE EVENT IS ONGOING WILL CONTINUE WITH WARNINGS AND 
ADVISORIES AS IS. HOWEVER...ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS MAY NOT REACH 
THE REQUIRED THRESHOLDS.

PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE INTO MONDAY WITH SNOW PRIMARILY CONFINED 
TO THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. EXPECT TO SEE ANOTHER INCH OF TWO OF 
ACCUMULATION IN CENTRAL OHIO. ELSEWHERE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE 
QUITE LIGHT AND IN THE FORM OF FREEZING DRIZZLE/FREEZING RAIN AND/OR 
SOME SLEET.

ANY LINGERING PRECIPITATION SHOULD WIND DOWN BY MONDAY EVENING. 
EXPECT A BREAK IN THE WEATHER FOR TUESDAY. BUT MORE PRECIPITATION 
MAY STREAK EASTWARD INTO THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY 
PRIMARILY ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS. LOOKS LIKE THIS WILL BE 
RAIN/FREEZING RAIN TUESDAY NIGHT WITH TEMPERATURES WARMING UP 
SUFFICIENTLY TO HAVE ALL RAIN ON WEDNESDAY.

TOUGHEST PART OF FCST IS JUST HOW MUCH OF THE PRECIP IN THE PMH AREA 
WILL BE IN THE FORM OF IP...AND WHEN THE CHANGEOVER WILL OCCUR. 
PRETTY BIG DIFFERENCES ON THE SMALL SCALE BETWEEN THE GFS AND ETA. 
WHILE THIS AREA WILL SEE THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF PRECIP...AM NOT 
THINKING THAT A CHANGEOVER TO ALL SN WILL OCCUR TIL AROUND 12Z SUN. 
BEFORE THAT...WILL LIKELY BE A MIX OF SN AND IP WITH A PRETTY GOOD 
WARM LAYER LINGERING OVER THIS SOUTHERN AREA. BEST ISENT LIFT IS 
AFTR 06Z AND THROUGH THE DAY SUNDAY. 

SO FAR THE GFS H7 DIVERGENCE HAS PICKED OUT THE BEST DEFORMATION 
ZONE AND RESULTANT AREA OF BEST ACCUMULATING PRECIP. THIS ALSO HINTS 
AT BEST PRECIP TO BE BETWEEN 06Z AND 8Z...WITH A BIT OF A LULL AFTER 
THAT UNTIL AFTER 00Z MON.

DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY...WE FINALLY BECOME COLD ENOUGH FOR ALL SN 
FOR THE ENTIRE FA. THIS JUST IN TIME FOR THE BEST MOISTURE TO BEGIN 
TO PUSH TO THE S AND E OF FA. 

WILL ISSUE A WARNING FOR THE FAR SE AREA...WITH ADVISORIES FOR AS 
FAR N AS CMH AREA...THEN INTO THE NRN AREAS OF THE CVG AREA. WHILE 
IT SEEMS THE GFS IS THE CONSENSUS MODEL...BUT AM NOT TOO CONFIDENT 
WITH THE SECONDARY BAND OF PRECIP COMING THROUGH CNTRL FA FROM THE

A COMPLEX WINTER WX SITUATION TONIGHT.  THE GFS IS SOME WHAT WETTER 
THAN THE ETA THROUGH SATURDAY.  LOOKING AT THE 12Z ETA 
SNDGS...KDAY...KILN AND KCMH LOOK TO BE ALL SNOW.  CONSIDERING THE 
CURRENT ANALYSIS PRECIP BREAKDOWN...THIS LOOKS REASONABLE.  

THERE IS GOOD ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE AREA ON THE ETA 295K SFC 
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING.  THE MIX RATIO AVERAGES 3 TO 4 ACROSS MOST 
OF THIS AREA.  CONSIDERING THIS...ALONG WITH QPF...WILL KEEP 
EXISTING WINTER STORM WARNINGS BUT WILL CUT AMOUNTS TO 4 TO 6 AND 3 
TO 5 TOTALS NORTH TO SOUTH.

WILL KEEP A TRANSITION ADVISORY ZONE TONIGHT FOR AREAS BETWEEN THE 
OHIO RIVER AND KDAY WITH 2 TO 4 INCHES OF SNOW AND SOME ICE.  RECENT 
MODEL TRENDS SHOW A NARROWER AND LESS INTENSE ICE EVENT TONIGHT.

THERE IS A ZONE INCLUDING KCVG THAT WILL BE IN AN ADVISORY FOR A 
MIX OF FZRA AND RA THROUGH THE NIGHT.  AREAS IN THE FAR SOUTH SHOULD 
STAY ALL RAIN TONIGHT...BUT WILL TRANSITION TO FZRA ON SATURDAY AND 
WILL GIVE THEM AN ADVISORY FOR THIS.  BOTH OF THESE AREAS WILL SHIFT 
TO A FZRA-SN-IP MIX SITUATION FOR MUCH OF SATURDAY.

MODEL DIFFERENCES COME INTO PLAY FOR SUNDAY AS ETA HAS A MORE 
PRONOUNCED INVERTED SFC TROF WITH MORE QPF AS UPPER TROF MOVES

THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING.  THE MIX RATIO AVERAGES 3 TO 4 ACROSS MOST 
OF THIS AREA.  CONSIDERING THIS...ALONG WITH QPF...WILL KEEP 
EXISTING WINTER STORM WARNINGS BUT WILL CUT AMOUNTS TO 4 TO 6 AND 3 
TO 5 TOTALS NORTH TO SOUTH.

WILL KEEP A TRANSITION ADVISORY ZONE TONIGHT FOR AREAS BETWEEN THE 
OHIO RIVER AND KDAY WITH 2 TO 4 INCHES OF SNOW AND SOME ICE.  RECENT 
MODEL TRENDS SHOW A NARROWER AND LESS INTENSE ICE EVENT TONIGHT.

THERE IS A ZONE INCLUDING KCVG THAT WILL BE IN AN ADVISORY FOR A 
MIX OF FZRA AND RA THROUGH THE NIGHT.  AREAS IN THE FAR SOUTH SHOULD 
STAY ALL RAIN TONIGHT...BUT WILL TRANSITION TO FZRA ON SATURDAY AND 
WILL GIVE THEM AN ADVISORY FOR THIS.  BOTH OF THESE AREAS WILL SHIFT 
TO A FZRA-SN-IP MIX SITUATION FOR MUCH OF SATURDAY.

MODEL DIFFERENCES COME INTO PLAY FOR SUNDAY AS ETA HAS A MORE 
PRONOUNCED INVERTED SFC TROF WITH MORE QPF AS UPPER TROF MOVES 
ACROSS AREA.  THIS COULD PRODUCE SEVERAL INCHES OF SNOW...WITH THE 
BEST COVERAGE IN THE SE.

THANKS TO CLE AND IND FOR COORD CALL. HEARD IWX ON WWE CALL AND SAW 
AFD...AGREE WITH WATCH FOR LATE FRIDAY INTO FRI PM BUT MY FCST AREA 
WILL BE MORE FZRA VS SNOW.

ZONAL NW FLOW TO ALLOW FEW MID DECK CLOUDS UPSTREAM TO PASS OVER 
FCST AREA TODAY. H5 RIDGE FROM THE GULF TO PAC NW WILL BREAK DOWN 
WITH A S/W HELPING SFC DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. 
WMFNT WILL EXTEND THROUGH SRN FCST AREA AS ENERGY GETS TRANSLATED E 
ALONG THE FRONT AND SFC LOW STRETCHES OUT ALONG BOUDARY OF THE FRONT.

MODELS ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT FOR THEIR MASS FIELDS FOR THE SETUP 
OF THIS BOUNDARY. PROBLEMS HERE WILL BE HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE 
DRAWN UP FROM THE GULF AND THE NORTHERN EXTENT OF PRECIP. MODELS 
YESTERDAY SHOWED A DEFINITE NORTHERN CUTOFF OF QPF FIELD DUE TO A NE 
WIND COMPONENT IN LLVLS. TODAY THIS NE COMPONENT ISNT AS PRONOUNCED 
AND MODELS HAVE DRAMATICALLY INCREASED QPF OVER NRN FCST AREA WITH 
AN 850 JET OF 75KTS(ETA) IN TN/KY BY 0Z SAT. THE JET SEEMS A BIT 
OVERDONE BUT THERE WILL DEFINITELY BE A STRONG MOISTURE FEED TO THIS 
SYSTEM. CURRENTLY, I LIKE THE NGM QPF FIELDS WHICH ARE A VERY CLOSE 
PROXIMATION OF THE GFS. WILL KEY ON THE NGM FOR START TIMES OF 
PRECIP.

PLACEMENT OF FRONT WILL BE KEY TO PTYPE AND AREAL EXTENT OF ANY 
FUTURE WARNINGS. PROBLEM HERE IS GOING TO BE WHAT TEMPS AT THE SFC 
DO AS THE FRONT SETS UP. NRN FA SHOULD BE AOB FREEZING AND WITH THIS 
MUCH QPF NOTED ON THE MODELS, A WATCH FOR FZRA IS DEFINITELY IN 
ORDER FOR N 1/2 OF CWA BUT I WOULD EXPECT THIS TO BE AN EVENING 
EVENT BASED ON A SLOWER START. WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND PUT NW 
1/4 OF CWA IN FOR THE AFTERNOON AND NIGHT...NIGHTTIME ONLY IN THE NE 
1/4. SRN FCST AREA WILL BE COVERED WITH AN ESF TO HIGHLIGHT 
POTENTIAL FOR SOME FLOODING FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. 

.ILN...WINTER STORM WATCH FRIDAY AFTERNOON INTO OVERNIGHT NORTHWEST 
FCST AREA FOR FREEZING RAIN.
WINTER STORM WATCH FRIDAY NIGHT NORTHEAST FCST AREA FOR FREEZING 
RAIN.

QUIET WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WILL ABRUPTLY COME TO AN END 
ON FRIDAY. MODELS IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS CYCLE WITH FIELDS 
ALTHOUGH THE GFS IS A BIT FURTHER NORTH. 

WARM FRONT WILL DEVELOP IN THE OHIO VALLEY ON FRIDAY WITH 
PRECIPITATION SPREADING NORTH OF IT DURING THE DAY. THIS 
PRECIPITATION SHOULD CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY NIGHT AND THEN TAPER OFF 
LATE AS ONE WAVE ALONG THE FRONT MOVES PAST. ANOTHER WAVE OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL APPROACH ON SATURDAY WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH FORMING 
NORTHWARD INTO OHIO ON SUNDAY BEFORE THE ENTIRE SYSTEM MOVES OFF TO 
THE EAST SUNDAY NIGHT.

PRECIPITATION TYPE WILL A QUESTION AS MODELS SHOW QUITE A BIT OF 
WARM AIR ALOFT ADVECTING NORTHWARD ACROSS THE AREA. APPEARS THAT 
SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARM ENOUGH ALONG THE OHIO RIVER TO 
KEEP PRECIPITATION ALL RAIN UNTIL THE FIRST SURFACE WAVE PASSES. 
HOWEVER THERE COULD BE SOME HEAVY RAIN IN THIS PART OF THE AREA.

EXPECT A WINTRY MIX TO OCCUR ALONG THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE 
PRECIPITATION SHIELD AS IT SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA ON FRIDAY. BY 
FRIDAY NIGHT APPEARS THAT WARM AIR ALOFT WILL BE DEEP ENOUGH FOR 
PRECIPITATION TO BE ALL LIQUID. SO AS TEMPERATURES FALL RAIN WILL 
CHANGE TO FREEZING RAIN.

GFS SHOWS COOLING ALOFT ON SATURDAY SO PRECIPITATION TYPE WOULD 
INCLUDE SOME SLEET AND SNOW MIXED IN AS WELL. BUT SINCE UNCERTAINTY 
INCREASES WITH TIME WILL PROBABLY LIMIT PRECIPITATION TYPES INCLUDED 
IN THE FORECAST THAT FAR OUT. OF COURSE A SLIGHT CHANGE IN THE MODEL 
THERMAL FIELDS MAY LEAD TO QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE IN 
PRECIPITATION TYPES THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST. HAVE STAYED FAIRLY

STRONG NW FLOW AT H8 AND H7 WILL BRING SOME LE SNOW OFF OF LAKE MICH 
BUT I THINK THAT IT WILL NOT REACH NWRN CWA TODAY DUE TO SHEAR AND A 
LESS THAN FAVORABLE FETCH OFF OF THE LAKE. 

NEXT SYSTEM TO BRING ACTIVE WX WILL BE ON FRIDAY AS A SFC LOW 
APPROACHES THE MIDWEST AND ASSOCIATED WMFNT SETS UP OVER FAR SRN 
FCST AREA. I THINK THAT PRECIP WILL BE LOCATED IMMEDIATELY BEHIND H8 
RIDGE THAT BREAKS DOWN AHEAD OF THE STRENGTHENING WMFNT THAT DEEPENS 
UP TO H8 BY 0Z SAT. NRN FCST AREA IS NOTED TO BE DRY ON ETA BUT AVN 
IS A BIT STRONGER IN PUSHING QPF NWRD...ESPECIALLY BY 0Z SAT. NE 
WIND SHOULD BRING A DRYING TREND OVER NRN CWA AND KEEP PRECIP TO THE 
S FOR MOST OF THE DAY IF NOT FRI PM INTO SATURDAY. 

PRECIP TYPE APPEARS TO BE ALL RAIN FROM THE ETA...AND WITH THE LOW 
CHANCE POPS OVER THE REST OF NRN CWA...WILL ADD MENTION OF RAIN HERE 
AND REMOVE MENTION OF SNOW IN THE SOUTH. AVN THICKNESS THROUGH 0Z 
SATURDAY ALSO SUPPORT RAIN IN THE SOUTH WITH SOME MIX IN THE NORTH. 

TEMPS FROM PREVIOUS FCST WERE GOOD AND ONLY MINOR TWEEKS EXPECTED 
FOR NEXT SEVERAL PERIOD. 

THE CURRENT ADVY FOR BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW WILL BE DROPPED WITH 
NEXT ISSUANCE. GRADIENT RELAXES QUITE A BIT AND ADVY CONDITIONS 
WONT BE MET. HOWEVER SOME BLOWING AND DRIFTING WILL OCCUR, BUT NOT

EXPECT TO BE CANCELING THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY BY MIDDAY. 
RADAR SHOWS THAT SNOW IS RAPIDLY DIMINISHING. EXPECT IT TO MOVE OUT 
OF SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO SOON. CLEARING SKIES QUICKLY MOVING IN FROM 
THE WEST AND SO WILL GO MORE OPTIMISTIC WITH SKY CONDITION. THIS MAY 
ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RISE A LITTLE MORE THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST

SHOT OF SNOW THIS MORNING FROM WWE GRAPHICS BY HPC IS 6 HOURS TOO

UP WELL WITH 850 MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM MESOETA AND THE 285K

LITTLE HIGH IN WAA WITH LIFT AND MOISTURE CENTERED ALONG CWAS SRN 
BORDER IN KY. LIKELY POPS IN THE SOUTH ARE GOOD AND THE INCH OF 
ACCUM ALREADY MENTIONED APPEARS TO BE THE BEST SOLUTION. THIS SHOT 
OF SNOW SHOULD BE SHORT-LIVED BUT ON THE HEAVY SIDE AT TIMES. 

STRONG SHOT OF CAA EXPECTED TONIGHT AS ARCTIC FRONT SLIDES THROUGH 
FCST AREA WITH THE BEST SHOT OF FORCING LOCATED IN NRN CWA. H8 -20 
AIR IS IN CWA DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY AND ILL ADD SCT SHSN IN 
ENTIRE FCST AREA EVEN THOUGH MODELS ARE QUITE DRY. THAT MUCH OF A 
COLD SHOT HAS BEEN PRODUCING SOME FORM OF SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE PAST 
SEVERAL WEEKS WITH OR WITHOUT MOISTURE INDICATED ON MODELS. 

TEMPERATURE CURVE WILL BE ODD TONIGHT AS WAA AHEAD OF FRONT WILL 
KEEP READINGS STEADY FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE NIGHT IN THE 
SOUTHEAST. HOWEVER, FRONT IS EXPECTED TO BE SE OF FCST AREA BY 12Z 
SO A QUICK DROPOFF IS EXPECTED LATE AND PLACEMENT OF FRONT SHOULD

SHOT OF SNOW THIS MORNING FROM WWE GRAPHICS BY HPC IS 6 HOURS TOO 
FAST. OTHER MODELS HAVE SNOW BEGINNING EARLY IN THE SW AND SPREADING 
EAST...MAINLY ALONG AND S OF OHRIVER. CURRENT RADAR OVER MO/IL LINES 
UP WELL WITH 850 MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM MESOETA AND THE 285K 
ADIABATIC OMEGA FIELD. THINK THAT 40 POPS OVER THE NORTH ARE A 
LITTLE HIGH IN WAA WITH LIFT AND MOISTURE CENTERED ALONG CWAS SRN 
BORDER IN KY. LIKELY POPS IN THE SOUTH ARE GOOD AND THE INCH OF 
ACCUM ALREADY MENTIONED APPEARS TO BE THE BEST SOLUTION. THIS SHOT 
OF SNOW SHOULD BE SHORT-LIVED BUT ON THE HEAVY SIDE AT TIMES. 

STRONG SHOT OF CAA EXPECTED TONIGHT AS ARCTIC FRONT SLIDES THROUGH 
FCST AREA WITH THE BEST SHOT OF FORCING LOCATED IN NRN CWA. H8 -20 
AIR IS IN CWA DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY AND ILL ADD SCT SHSN IN 
ENTIRE FCST AREA EVEN THOUGH MODELS ARE QUITE DRY. THAT MUCH OF A 
COLD SHOT HAS BEEN PRODUCING SOME FORM OF SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE PAST 
SEVERAL WEEKS WITH OR WITHOUT MOISTURE INDICATED ON MODELS. 

TEMPERATURE CURVE WILL BE ODD TONIGHT AS WAA AHEAD OF FRONT WILL 
KEEP READINGS STEADY FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE NIGHT IN THE 
SOUTHEAST. HOWEVER, FRONT IS EXPECTED TO BE SE OF FCST AREA BY 12Z 
SO A QUICK DROPOFF IS EXPECTED LATE AND PLACEMENT OF FRONT SHOULD 
BRING THEIR LOWS IN LINE WITH REST OF FCST AREA.

CURRENT SAT/RADAR ANALYSIS INDCG -SNSH CONTINUE ACRS THE REGION THIS 
AFTN WITH ARCTIC FRNTL BNDRY FROM NW OH BACK ACRS CNTRL INDIANA. 
FRNTL BNDRY WILL TRACK ACRS FCST AREA OVER NEXT 4-6 HRS WITH MUCH 
COLDER AIR SPILLING INTO REGION TONIGHT. 

FCST CHALLENGES REVOLVE AROUND ENDING SNSH TONIGHT AND TIMING AND 
AMNTS OF SN TUES/TUES NIGHT.  SNSH WILL LINGER INTO EVNG HRS IN WEST 
AND UNTIL AROUND MIDNITE IN EAST AS BETTER MOISTURE AND LIFT SHIFTS 
EAST OF REGION AND WINDS BACK TO WEST WITH HI PRES RIDGE MOVING 
OVERHEAD.  HAVE CHOSEN TO LEAVE SKIES MSTLY CLDY OVERNIGHT...AS SC 
LIKELY TO BE REPLACED QUICKLY BY AC AHEAD OF NEXT S/WV.  EVEN WITH A 
FEW BREAKS IN CLOUDS TONIGHT TEMPS SHOULD BE ABLE TO PLUMMET WITH 
FRESH SNOW COVER AND ARCTIC AIR MASS IN PLACE.  EXPECT SOME SINGLE 
DIGIT READINGS ACRS WEST CNTRL OH WITH TEENS ELSEWHERE.

NEXT S/WV TRACKING ACRS FCST AREA ON TUES LOOKING LESS IMPRESSIVE 
WITH EACH RUN.  S/WV ENERGY SHEARING OUT ACRS REGION AND ISENTROPIC 
LIFT BTWN 280-285K WEAK.  FEEL GFS QPF AMNTS ARE A LITTLE HIGH WITH 
SYSTEM...SO AM GOING TO SCALE BACK ON SNOWFALL AMNTS.  BEST CHC FOR 
SNOW WILL BE ACRS SOUTHERN ZONES WHERE WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY 
POPS AND AROUND 1 INCH ACCUM.  DROPPING BACK TO CHC POPS ACRS 
NORTHERN ZONES WITH ONLY LITTLE ACCUM.

OF MORE INTEREST IS THE NEXT S/WV ALONG WITH REINFORCING SHOT OF 
ARCTIC AIR TRACKING INTO REGION OVERNIGHT TUESDAY.  SOME DIFFERENCES 
AMONG GFS/ETA IN HANDLING OF SYSTEM...MOST NOTABLY WITH QPF AMNTS 
AND SFC REFLECTION.  ETA DVLPG SFC LO ALONG FRNTL BNDRY AND TRACKING 
LO ACRS NORTHERN OH DURING THE NIGHT.  GFS NOT PICKING UP ON SFC LO 
REFLECTION...ALLOWING FOR TRACK TO BE FURTHER NORTH.  BOTH MODELS 
INDCG STRONG Q-VECTOR CONV AND STRONG PVA BTWN 03-09Z WED.  WITH GFS 
BEING MORE SUPERIOR IN CONSISTENCY AS OF LATE...WILL TREND MORE 
TOWARDS ITS SOLN ON THIS SYSTEM.  THIS STILL WARRANTS UPGRADE TO 
LIKELY POPS ACRS NORTHERN 1/2 CWA WITH SOME ACCUM MENTION.  WILL GO 
1-2 ACRS WEST CNTRL OH...WITH ARND AN INCH DAY-CMH ZONES.  COLDER 
AND DRIER AIR WILL BUILD IN BEHIND FRNT FOR WED WITH HI PRES 
TRACKING INTO SE CONUS.

TEMPS...ONLY FEW ADJUSTMENTS FROM PREV FCST TEMPS AS MAV GUID STILL 
LOOKS GOOD.  RAISED TEMPS TONIGHT FEW DEGREES CONSIDERING MORE CLOUD 
COVER.  LOOKS LIKE FEWEST CLDS ON WED NIGHT SO DROPPED TEMPS DOWN A 
CAT OR SO WITH SNOW COVER AND NEUTRAL ADVECTION.

EXTENDED...NEXT STORM POISED TO AFFECT REGION FROM MIDDAY FRI INTO 
SAT.  LIKELY TO BE DEALING WITH A COUPLE DIFFERENT PCPN TYPES AS 
EXPECT ATMOSPHERE WILL MODERATE ENOUGH TO SUPPORT SHRA FRI NIGHT 
INTO SAT.  DID NOT CHANGE PREV FCST WHICH HAD CHC SN/RA BOTH DAYS AS 
STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY AMONGST MODELS REGARDING TRACK/SPEED OF

FCST CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS HOW MUCH WIND WILL BE WITH THIS SYSTEM AS 
IT PASSES AND HOW TO HANDLE ANY PUBLIC IMPACT. VAD WIND PROFILE FROM 
KILN SHOWING 50 KTS AT 3KFT AND 40 AT 2KFT. ETA SHOWING A NOCTURNAL 
INCREASE IN THE WAA AHEAD OF THE FRONT AT 6Z TONIGHT IN ERN FCST 
AREA BUT THIS WILL STILL BE IN THE WAA AND SHOULD NOT REACH THE 
GROUND WITH ANY SIGNIFICANT WINDS. 

CURRENT THINKING IS THAT WERE GOING TO GET WIDESPREAD 20 TO 30 MPH 
WINDS WITH OCCASIONAL GUSTS TO 40. THIS MATCHES WELL WITH IWX AND 
CLE FCSTS. ADVY CRITERIA MAY BE BRIEFLY MET OVER THE FAR N...BUT 
THIS IS STILL IN QUESTION AS BEST WINDS REMAIN IN THE WAA AHEAD AND 
WITH THE FRONT. 

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. LOOKS LIKE A 
SHOT OF SNOW POSSIBLE LATER ON THURSDAY AND THEN AGAIN ON SUNDAY. 
DIFFERENCES ON THURSDAY BETWEEN THE GFS AND ETA ARE SIGNIFICANT 
ENOUGH TO CAUSE SOME PROBLEMS. GFS HOLDS ON TO SFC HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER VA/NC WITH A RIDGE THAT EXTENDS TO THE WEST, JUST S OF FCST 
AREA. THIS WOULD KEEP TEMPS DOWN AND LIMIT ANY PRECIP TO THE N AND S 
OF FCST AREA. ON THE ETA, THE HIGH GETS CAUGHT IN DECENT ZONAL FLOW 
AND IS OFF THE COAST. THIS ALLOWS THE SFC L OVER MICH TO DEEPEN AND 
BRING IN SOME WARMER AIR FROM THE SW WITH A TYPICAL BAROCLINIC LEAF 
PATTERN. WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE HERE AND EXPECT A WEAK RIDGE TO 
HAMPER A WARM SECTOR FROM GETTING INTO FCST AREA.

IN ANY CASE, FRONT SHOULD BE OVER FCST AREA ON 0Z FRI WITH LIMITED 
MOISTURE. REST OF MODELS AGREE THAT THE FRONT IS JUST SE OF FCST 
AREA BY 12Z FRI AND QUITE DRY BEHIND IT FOR SEVERAL DAYS. H8 THERMAL 
TROF IS INDICATED TO PASS THROUGH DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY SO TEMPS 
WILL BE A GOOD BIT COOLER THAN GUIDANCE UNDER SUNNY SKIES FOR THURS 
PM THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY. THIS COMES IN LINE WITH CURRENT FCST 
ALTHOUGH DAYTIME HIGHS ARE A BIT TOO WARM. WILL CUT ABOUT 5 DEGREES 
ACROSS THE BOARD FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS OF CURRENT FCST AND EXPECT 
LOWS IN THE TEENS AND HIGHS IN THE 20S. 

GRIDS IN DATABASE ALREADY. MIS OUT ASAP.

ENTIRE FORECAST AREA SHOULD BE IN THE WARM SECTOR BY THIS AFTERNOON.

PRECIPITATION THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE IN THE WESTERN ZONES CLOSER TO 
FORCING FROM APPROACHING STORM SYSTEM.

OVERNIGHT. EXPECT CONVECTIVE LINE TO DEVELOP AND MOVE THROUGH THE

GOOD FORCING WILL INCLUDE A MENTION OF THUNDER IN ALL AREAS WHICH 
ALSO MESHES WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. AFTER THE FRONT PASSES THERE

SHOWERS WILL CHANGE OVER TO SNOW SHOWERS DURING THE LATTER PART OF 
THE NIGHT. DRY SLOT WILL BE WORKING IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM WHICH WILL 
LIMIT MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION FOR LATE TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY. SO ANY 
SNOW SHOWERS THAT OCCUR SHOULD BRING LITTLE OR NO ACCUMULATION. 

GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES RATHER CLOSE FOR TODAY AND IF ANYTHING LEANED

TOMORROW WITH NEARLY STEADY TEMPERATURES THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON

AREA OF RAIN MIXED WITH SOME SLEET IS QUICKLY MOVING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. WILL LIKELY HAVE TO CONTINUE A 
MENTION OF THIS FOR NORTHERN ZONES EARLY THIS MORNING BUT WILL 
REEVALUATE RADAR TRENDS JUST BEFORE SENDING FORECAST. 

MODELS HAVE COME INTO RATHER GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE FORECAST 
WITH THE ETA BEING JUST A BIT FASTER THAN THE GFS. WARM FRONT WILL 
DEVELOP ALONG THE OHIO RIVER TODAY AND LIFT NORTH ACROSS THE REGION 
OVERNIGHT. CHANCE FOR SHOWERS LATE TONIGHT DOES NOT LOOKS AS GOOD AS 
IN EARLY RUNS. SO WILL CUT BACK TO JUST THE WESTERN ZONES WHERE NOSE 
OF THE LOW LEVEL WIND MAXIMUM WILL BE LOCATED. 

ANY SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP LATE TONIGHT SHOULD QUICKLY LIFT NORTH OF 
THE FORECAST AREA EARLY MONDAY MORNING. APPEARS THAT THERE WILL BE A 
LULL IN PRECIPITATION UNTIL THE MAIN SYSTEM APPROACHES LATE IN THE 
DAY. GOOD LIFT AHEAD OF COLD FRONT WILL BRING SHOWERS INTO WESTERN 
ZONES LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. HAVE BUMPED UP PROBABILITIES TO LIKELY 
THERE AND HAVE GONE CATEGORICAL FOR ALL ZONES MONDAY NIGHT. THERE 
SHOULD BE GOOD COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AS COLD FRONT SWEEPS ACROSS THE 
AREA. LATEST MODEL RUNS SUGGEST THAT SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY COULD 
BE PRESENT IN SOUTHERN ZONES. WITH GOOD FORCING WILL GO AHEAD AND 
ADD A CHANCE OF THUNDER IN AS WELL.

BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE ALONG AND AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT. AS COLD AIR WRAPS IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM AND CHANGES 
PRECIPITATION TYPE TO SNOW SHOWERS EXPECT COVERAGE TO ONLY BE 
SCATTERED AT BEST. THE CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD CONTINUE 
THROUGH TUESDAY WITH LITTLE OR NO RISE IN TEMPERATURES DURING THE 
DAY.

MAIN QUESTION TO FCST WILL BE IN THE FIRST PERIOD WHERE PTYPE COMES 
INTO PLAY OR AT LEAST TIMING OF CHANGEOVER IS IN THE MIX. CLOUDS 
APPEAR TO BE DOMINANT THROUGH THE FCST PERIOD WITH AN EXCEPTION 
DURING THE AFTERNOON SAT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE THERMAL TROF. 
MODELS ARE SPEEDING UP THE CLEARING AT H8 BUT MAINLY IN THE WEST. 

READING PREEPD I WILL TAKE THEIR SUGGESTION TO SLOW DOWN THE NEG 
TILT ON THE H5 LOW MON/TUES. TEMPS ON MON PM AND TUES WILL BE A 
PROBLEM WITH THE LOW PROBABLY OVER ERN FCST AREA. WILL TAKE THE AVN 
GUIDANCE HERE BUT EXPECT THAT FALLING TEMPS DURING THE DAY WILL 
PREVAIL WITH MORNING LOWS QUITE WARM IN THE EAST AHEAD OF THE FRONT. 

ENSEMBLES FEEL PRETTY STRONG ON HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN THE NRN 
PLAINS TO SERN U.S. WHICH IS PRETTY SIMILAR TO THE PATTERN THAT GAVE 
US THE COLD SNAP A FEW DAYS AGO. DONT THINK THAT THERE WILL BE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT FRESH SNOW COVER TO BRING TEMPS DOWN QUITE AS FAR, BUT 
WILL DEFINITELY TREND COLD IN THE LAST 2 DAYS WITH PC/CLEAR SKIES AT 
NIGHT AND PC/MC IN THE DAY ON A S-N GRADIENT WITH NRN CWA CLOSEST TO 
H8 COLD POOL AND CLOUD COVER.

TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD WERE CHANGED WITH THE THINKING OF PLACEMENT 
OF FRONT ON MON/TUES, AND COOLED OFF SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE LAST 2

COUNTY ATTM.  THIS FRONT WILL SAG SLOWLY SOUTH THIS MORNING AND THIS 
AFTN...BEING LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF THE SERN CWFA AROUND 18Z.  
ENHANCED BAND OF SNOW ASSOCD WITH FRONT SHOULD GIVE TOTAL SNOW

ENDING.  WITH LACK OF MID LVL CLOUD DECK DEPARTING BY AFTERNOON AND 
LOW LVL STRATUS HANGING AROUND (COMBINED WITH WEAK CAA)...THERE WILL 
BE A CHANCE FOR FREEZING DRIZZLE.  WEAK CAA WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO 
SLOWLY FALL DURING THE DAY.

OCCASIONAL PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. THIS HAS BEEN A WINTRY MIX ALTHOUGH 
IT APPEARS THAT EAST-WEST BAND INTO WEST CENTRAL OHIO MAY BE ALL 
SNOW. FOR THE MOST PART TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN STEADY OR EVEN 
CONTINUE TO RISE EVER SO SLIGHTLY. THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA HAS BEEN PRECIPITATION FREE THUS FAR AND WARM ENOUGH TO BE ALL 
RAIN AT THIS TIME BASED ON THE EVENING SOUNDING.

LOOKS LIKE BANDING PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD INTO THE 
NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. BUT EXPECT THIS TO 
DIMINISH TOWARDS MORNING AS BETTER FORCING DEVELOPS FURTHER SOUTH 
WITH WAVE DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT. THIS SHOULD HELP SPREAD 
PRECIPITATION INTO SOUTHERN ZONES LATE TONIGHT. WILL CONTINUE WITH 
LIKELY PROBABILITIES IN THE SOUTH AND CATEGORICAL IN THE NORTH.  

FORECAST PROFILE FROM THE 18Z ETA VERIFIED PRETTY WELL WITH THE 
EVENING SOUNDING. THIS GIVES A LITTLE MORE CONFIDENCE IN BASING 
PRECIPITATION TYPE ON THE SOUNDINGS FROM THAT MODEL RUN. SO LOOKS 
LIKE THE MIX IN THE NORTH SHOULD CHANGE OVER TO ALL SNOW IN THE 
07-10Z TIME FRAME. EXPECT RAIN CHANGING TO SNOW VERY LATE FROM 
HAMILTON TO CHILLICOTHE. AND SOUTH OF THERE LOOKS LIKE TEMPERATURES 
WILL REMAIN WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL RAIN THROUGH DAYBREAK.

WILL CONTINUE WITH ADVISORIES IN THEIR CURRENT CONFIGURATION. MAY 
LOWER SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SLIGHTLY BUT WITH THE MIXED PRECIPITATION 
EARLY WILL BE ABLE TO KEEP ADVISORY GOING. WILL ALSO MAKE SOME MINOR 
ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPERATURES AND WINDS.

COMPLEX WINTER WEATHER SCENARIO IS EXPECTED LATE THIS INTO TONIGHT 
ACRS THE CWFA.

A WARM...MOIST ASCENT OF AIR WILL INCREASE OVER THE AREA TODAY AS 
850 MB JET INTENSIFIES.  DEVELOPING LOWER LVL CLOUDS WERE EVIDENT ON 
SATELLITE THIS MORNING...JUSTIFYING THE BEGINNING OF THE MOIST 
ASCENT.  ETA/GFS HAVE SIMILAR SOLUTIONS...JUST DIFFERENT POSITIONING 
OF MAIN PRECIPITATION BANDS TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT.  QG 
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING BETWEEN THE 850 MB TO 700 MB LAYER IS EVIDENT 
ON BOTH THE GFS AND ETA.  HOWEVER...THE ETA PLACES THE BEST FORCING 
OVER NORTHERN AND CENTRAL OHIO TODAY AND TONIGHT WHILE THE AVN WANTS 
TO PUT THE BEST FORCING SOMEWHAT FARTHER NORTH THAN THIS.  WILL TAKE 
A BLEND BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS.  THUS...PCPN SHOULD START LATE THIS 
AFTN IN THE NORTH...GRADUALLY FILLING IN TOWARD THE SOUTH AS THE 
COLD FRONT TO OUR NORTHWEST PUSHES SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE REGION.  
BASED ON HOURLY SOUNDINGS...PCPN SHOULD BE ALL SNOW FAR NORTH...SNOW 
AND SLEET IN THE CENTRAL LOCATIONS AND RAIN FAR SOUTH.  MOST OF THE 
FAR SOUTH...INCLUDING CVG AND PMH...SHOULD SEE A COLD RAIN FOR 
TONIGHT WITH A MIX POSSIBLE ON WEDNESDAY MORNING BEFORE ENDING.  
WILL ALSO THROUGH IN A CHC OF FZDZ OR SNOW FLURRIES IN THE NORTH ON 
WEDNESDAY AS MODEL SOUNDINGS SUPPORT POSSIBLE FZDZ...ESPECIALLY 
THROUGH EARLY AFTN.  TOTAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF 3 TO 5 FAR NORTH 
(WAPAKONETA...KENTON)...2 TO 4 CENTRAL (DAYTON AND COLUMBUS) AND 
AROUND AN INCH (BROOKSVILLE...LEBANON...WILMINGTON...CHILLICOTHE) 
ARE EXPECTED BY WEDNESDAY MORNING.

ANOTHER S/WV WILL PUSH SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  HOWEVER...IT SEEMS TO BE A FOCUS OF

A FEW LINGERING LAKE EFFECT SC/FLURRIES STILL DRIFTING ACROSS THE

FRESH SNOW COVER AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES HAVE ALLOWED TEMPS TO 
DROP OFF PRETTY GOOD WITH CURRENT READINGS IN THE ZERO TO -10 RANGE. 
IF SKIES CAN REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR THROUGH DAYBREAK AND WINDS GO A 
LITTLE LIGHTER...WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON RECORDS THIS MORNING 
(CMH -8...DAY -9 AND CVG -11).

EXPECT MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES THIS MORNING WITH SOME INCREASING HIGH 
CLOUDS AS WE HEAD INTO THIS AFTERNOON. AFTER COLD START THIS 
MORNING...INCREASING SWLY FLOW AND WAA SHOULD ALLOW FOR TEMPS TO 
CLIMB UP INTO THE 15 TO 20 DEGREE RANGE. SNOW COVER MAY HELP HOLD 
TEMPS DOWN A BIT SO WILL GO A LITTLE COOLER THAN GUID TEMPS FOR

GOOD ISENT LIFT ACROSS AREA TONIGHT WITH 40 KNOT CROSS CONTOUR FLOW 
ON 285-290K SURFACES. HOWEVER...LOW LEVELS REMAIN RELATIVELY DRY SO 
THINK WILL SEE DECENT AMOUNT OF VIRGA BUT NOT SURE HOW MUCH WILL 
REACH THE GROUND. WILL THEREFORE JUST GO WITH A LOW CHANCE POP IN 
THE NORTH FOR LIGHT SNOW AND THEN JUST A CHANCE OF FLURRIES IN THE

FLOW/WAA TO BRING AN INCREASING CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND TUESDAY NIGHT. ETA AND GFS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
THIS WITH DECENT 9H/8H JET NOSING INTO SOUTHERN FA TUESDAY NIGHT. 
THIS WILL PROVIDE BEST LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ACROSS THE NORTH FOR

WITH SURFACE HIGH BY 12Z MONDAY MORNING. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR 
CLEARING SKIES OVERNIGHT AND WINDS BECOMING LIGHT FOR GOOD 
RADIATIONAL COOLING TONIGHT..ESPECIALLY IF WE END UP WITH SOME FRESH

LOWS TONIGHT AND GENERALLY GO WITH LOWS IN THE ZERO TO 5 BELOW RANGE.
LOOKS LIKE WIND CHILLS WILL APPROACH THE -10 VALUE NEEDED FOR

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES HIGH PRESSURE OVER LOWER OHIO AND 
TENNESSEE VALLEYS WITH BROAD WESTERLY FLOW OVER FA.  SATELLITE 
IMAGERY INDICATES SOME STRATA CU OVER FA WITH PLENTY OF MID/HIGH 
CLOUDS UPSTREAM.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SOME SUBTLE DIFFERENCES WITH COLD 
FRONT PUSHING THROUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  BOTH AVN AND 
ETA HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT RUN TO RUN, RESPECTIVELY.  HOWEVER, THE AVN 
CONTINUES TO BE SHARPER WITH SURFACE FRONT AND STRONGER WITH THE 
MID LEVEL ENERGY.  UKMET LOOKS TO HAVE SIMILAR TIMING.

WILL GO WITH CLOUDY/MO CLOUDY THROUGH SUNDAY.  BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW AHEAD OF COLD FRONT LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  ETA 
INDICATES PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER FA.  PRECIP APPEARS TO 
BE POST FRONTAL WITH BEST LIFT...QG FORCING AND FLOW OF GREAT 
LAKES.  LAKE ERIE IS FROZEN OVER BUT FLOW OFF ONTARIO AND SOME FROM 
HURON SHOULD AID IN ADDING MOISTURE TO THE SYSTEM.  LIQUID TO SNOW 
RATIOS SHOULD BE 1 TO 20/30 AND BELIEVE A TENTH IS POSSIBLE ACROSS 
OUR EAST.  AS A RESULT WILL GO IN THE GRIDS 1 TO 2 IN THE EAST AND 
ON OR LESS IN THE WEST.

MAV TEMPS LOOK GOOD CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER EXPECTED.  
THE ONE EXCEPTION WILL BE ON SUNDAY WHERE WILL BUMP UP A CAT.

NICELY WITH SOME DECENT 850-700 MB Q VECTOR CONVERGENCE AND

ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 5090M H5 CUTOFF NEAR ERI AT 12Z 
THURSDAY.  

SURFACE MAP HAS RIDGE INTO ILN CWA.  NORTHERLY FLOW AROUND THE RIDGE 
IS ADVECTING COLD AIR IN HERE.  RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE DAYS.  WEATHER THROUGH THURSDAY WILL RESULT FROM UPPER

BEGINNING BY 00Z THIS EVENING...MAINLY ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE OHIO 
RIVER.  WITH HIGHEST QPF INDICATED SOUTH OF HERE...ILL KEEP 
ACCUMULATIONS AROUND AN INCH FOR NOW.  AFTER THAT SYSTEM MOVES EAST 
BY 12Z THURSDAY...PVA ASSOCIATED WITH MAIN CUTOFF WILL BRING CHANCE

MICHIGAN WILL THROW SOME LAKE MOISTURE INTO THE PICTURE.

WITH COLD ADVECTION REINFORCING OUR ALREADY CHILLY AIRMASS...TEMPS 
WILL NOT RISE OUT OF THE TEENS TODAY. SINGLE DIGITS WILL BE THE BEST 
WE CAN DO TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE.  CLEARING 
SKIES ON THURSDAY NIGHT WILL ALLOW COLDER THAN GUIDANCE NEGATIVE

MID LVL CLOUD DECK WAS NOTED ON VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER SRN 
CWFA...WHILE SOME DAYTIME GENERATED CUMULUS CLOUDS WERE FOUND ACRS

BE A LITTLE TRICKY TONIGHT GIVEN SNOW COVER AND TIMING OF NEXT MID 
LVL CLOUD DECK...SO WILL STICK CLOSE TO GFS MAV GUIDANCE AND ALLOW 
EVENING SHIFT TO TWEAK IT IN EITHER DIRECTION IF NEEDED.

SOME OF THE COLDEST AIR SO FAR THIS SEASON IS POISED TO MOVE SOUTH

THUS...HAVE CUT BACK A BIT ON SNOW CHC/S FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT...30 
PERCENT NORTH AND 40 PERCENT SOUTH.

VERY COLD AND AN UNSTABLE AIRMASS ON THURSDAY WILL GENERATE SNOW 
SHOWERS.  HIGH TEMPS WILL BARELY MAKE IT TO NEAR 10 DEGREES MOST 
LOCATIONS AS -23 C AIR WILL BE LOCATED AT THE 850 MB LVL.

H5 TROF QUICKLY EXITS OFF TO THE EAST THURSDAY NIGHT WITH 
SIGNIFICANT WAA OCCURRING ALOFT.  THE WAA SHOULD ERODE AWAY 
CUMULUS/STRATOCUMULUS DECK.  AS A RESULT...GIVEN THE COLD HIGHS ON 
THURSDAY...CLEARING SKIES AND RELAXING SFC WINDS SHOULD YIELD THE 
COLDEST OVERNIGHT LOWS SO FAR THIS WINTER SEASON.

DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WITH A GRADUAL 
MODERATION IN TEMPS.  NEXT CHC FOR PCPN APPEARS TO BE SUNDAY AS ALL 
MAIN LONG RANGE MODELS SHOW A WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH THE

SUN PM AND MON WX. IN EITHER CASE, SNOW WILL BE IN THE FCST WITH 
FCST AMOUNTS BEING LEFT TO LATER SHIFTS AND MODEL RUNS. 

CURRENT TREND WITH GFS SEEMS OFF AND I LIKE THE MANUAL GRAPHICS THAT 
WERE PRODUCED THIS MORNING FOR TUESDAY ON. THIS CAME IN LINE WITH 
YESTERDAYS THINKING THAT THE CONTINENTAL HIGH PRESSURE WOULD 
DOMINATE THE WX AND THAT ANY SRN LOW WOULD NOT HAVE ITS NRN LIMIT 
REACH ANYWHERE NEAR FCST AREA DUE TO STRENGTH OF COLD AIR IN PLACE 
OVER THE REGION. HOWEVER, I DO FEEL THAT THE GRAPHICS ARE A LITTLE 
TOO QUICK WITH PROGRESSION OF ARCTIC BOUNDARY. BELIEVE THAT MONDAY 
WILL SEE THE PASSAGE OF THE BOUNDARY VERSUS ALREADY BEING SOUTH OF

WITH THIS IN MIND, HAVE THROWN OUT THE GFS FOR THE EXTENDED AND WILL

CHALLENGE IN SHORT TERM IS EFFECTS ON CWA OF SYSTEM WHICH WILL MOVE 
TO THE SOUTH THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. ETA FASTER WITH SYSTEM AND 
GIVES HIGHER QPF THAN GFS BUT NO MAJOR DIFFERENCES IN TWO MODELS IN 
SHORT TERM. WITH COLD AIR IN PLACE EXPECT FAIRLY HIGH SNOW TO LIQUID 
RATIO...POSSIBLY ON THE ORDER OF 20 TO 1. ILN CWA WILL BE ON 
NORTHERN FRINGE OF HEAVIER SNOW BUT WITH HIGH RATIOS EXPECT 1 TO 3 
INCHES IN SOUTH WITH SOME LOCALLY HEAVIER AMOUNTS. START OF SNOW IN 
THE SOUTHWEST POSSIBLE AROUND DAYBREAK WITH HEAVIER SNOWFALL TOWARD 
MIDDAY. WITH THAT IN MIND...HAVE OPTED TO ISSUE WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY FOR EXTREME SOUTHWEST INCLUDING METRO 
CINCINNATI. MAY NEED AN ADVISORY FOR SOUTHEAST COUNTIES BUT 
PREICIPITATION NOT EXPECTED TO START THERE UNTIL WELL INTO SECOND 
PERIOD. 

CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUES THURSDAY NIGHT AND FLURRIES TAPER 
OFF ON FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES REMAIN ON THE COLD SIDE THROUGH THE 
PERIOD. 

EXTENDED...NO END IN SIGHT WITH COLD PATTERN ACRS REGION.  GFS 
STRONGER WITH S/WV TRACKING ACRS LOWER GRT LKS SAT NIGHT INTO ERLY 
SUN AND SUGGESTS ANOTHER QUICK SHOT AT SNOW.  UNSETTLED PATTERN 
CONTINUES INTO ERLY NEXT WEEK WITH ONE DISTURBANCE AFTER ANOTHER

SC DECK GENERALLY EAST OF REGION THIS MRNG AS HI PRES RIDGE BUILDING

PLUMMETED INTO SINGLE DIGITS ACROSS MUCH OF WESTERN FCST AREA.  
LOWEST TEMP AT DAYTON (3 DEGREES)...WITH CVG AND CMH BOTH AROUND 10 
ATTM.

MAIN FCST CHALLENGE REVOLVES AROUND WINTER STORM FOR THURS/THURS NIGHT AND 
EFFECTS FOR FCST AREA.  ETA NOW IN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WITH MORE 
CONSISTENT AND STRONGER GFS IN TRACK AND MOVEMENT OF SFC LO...ACROSS 
THE LOWER TN VALLEY THRU 00Z FRI AND OFF THE CAROLINA COAST BY 12Z 
FRI.  MODEL TREND HAS BEEN FOR SFC LO TO TRACK A LITTLE FURTHER 
NORTH OVER LAST SVRL RUNS...WHICH WOULD SPELL MORE SNOW FOR REGION.  
STRONG LO LVL CONVERGENCE AND GOOD LIFT ACRS SOUTHERN COUNTIES BY 
18Z THURS.  BEST QG FORCING ACRS SOUTHERN INDIANA AND NORTHERN KY 
WITH FRONTOGENESIS INDICATED LATE THURS INTO THURS NIGHT.  EXPECT 
SNOW TO START ACRS NORTHERN KY AND CVG AREA BY LATE MORNING 
THURS...AND ACRS REMAINDER FCST AREA BY ERLY AFTN.  SNOW WILL 
CONTINUE INTO THURS NIGHT...TAPERING TO -SHSN FROM WEST TO EAST AS 
SFC LO TRACKS INTO CAROLINAS AND NW FLO DVLPS.  HIGHEST AMTS WILL BE 
ACRS SOUTHERN ZONES...GENERALLY ALONG AND SOUTH OF A BROOKVILLE 
INDIANA TO CHILLICOTHE LINE.  THINK TOTAL ACCUM 2-3 INCHES A STRONG 
POSSIBILITY IN THESE AREAS...ESPECIALLY CONSIDERING THE HIGH SNOW TO 
LIQUID RATIOS (20-30 TO 1).  WILL LIKELY NEED AN ADVISORY (MAY EVEN 
COME CLOSE TO WSW CRIT ACRS NORTHERN KY COUNTIES) BUT CONSIDERING 
LATE 3RD-4TH PERIOD TIME FRAME...WILL LEAVE FOR DAYSHIFT TO DECIDE.

WILL TRANSITION TO SOME LAKE EFFECT SHSN OVERNIGHT INTO ERLY FRI 
WITH STRONG CAA AHEAD OF LONGWAVE TROF AND NW FLO.  DRIER AIR AND 
AND ANTICYCLONIC FLO SHOULD SQUELCH -SHSN BY MID AFTN ACRS EASTERN 
COUNTIES.  LO LVL THICKNESSES AND 850 TEMPS ALONG WITH RESIDUAL SNOW 
COVER SUGGESTS NORTHERN FCST AREA MAY STRUGGLE TO CLIMB ABV 20 ON 
FRI.  WITH SKIES CLEARING FRI NIGHT...LIKELY TO SEE COLDEST NIGHT OF

SOMEWHAT GENEROUS.

MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS FA ATTM BUT SAT PIX SHOWING HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS SPREADING UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST. GFS SEEMS TO HAVE A LITTLE 
BETTER HANDLE ON THIS...KEEPING FAIR AMOUNT OF HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE SOUTH THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT. MEANWHILE CLOUDS SHOULD ALSO 
BE ON THE INCREASE ACROSS THE NORTH LATER TONIGHT AHEAD OF 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL GO WITH PARTLY 
CLOUDY FOR ENTIRE AREA TONIGHT. WITH CLOUDS AND WINDS STAYING UP A 
LITTLE... EXPECT TEMPS A CAT OR TWO WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT AND WILL 
GENERALLY GO WITH LOWS IN THE 15 TO 20 DEGREE RANGE. 

COLD FRONT WILL PUSH DOWN THROUGH FA DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. NOT A 
WHOLE LOT IN THE WAY OF FORCING ALONG THE FRONT AND MOISTURE STILL 
PRETTY LIMITED SO WILL JUST KEEP FLURRIES GOING ACROSS THE FAR NORTH 
WHERE THEY ARE ALREADY IN THE FORECAST. CAA DOES NOT REALLY GET 
GOING ACROSS THE SOUTH TIL THE AFTERNOON SO PREFER TEMPS CLOSER TO 
WARMER FWC NUMBERS FOR HIGHS ON MONDAY. 

ETA AND GFS BOTH SHOWING S/W ENERGY DROPPING DOWN ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES FOR TUESDAY. GFS IS FARTHER SOUTH WITH IT AND INDICATING 
CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS MUCH OF FA WHILE ETA KEEPING THINGS 
MORE TO OUR NORTH AND EAST. DPROG/DT INDICATING THAT ETA IS A LITTLE 
MORE CONSISTENT WITH ITS PLACEMENT SO WILL LEAN THAT WAY FOR NOW AND 
JUST GO WITH SOME FLURRIES IN THE NORTH FOR TUESDAY.

IN THE EXTENDED...GFS CONTINUES TO TREND FARTHER SOUTH AND A LITTLE 
SLOWER WITH S/W MOVING OUT OF THE ROCKIES WITH ASSOCIATED SFC LOW 
NOW MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN GULF STATES AND NORTHERN EDGE OF PRECIP 
SHIELD JUST MAKING IT INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF FA. NEW 12Z UKMET 
LOOKS TO BE EVEN FARTHER SOUTH WITH THIS FEATURE. HOWEVER...ECMWF 
FROM 12Z YESTERDAY ACTUALLY FARTHER NORTH WITH IT THAN PREVIOUS RUN. 
WITH COLD AIR IN PLACE...MORE SOUTHERN TRACK MAY END UP BEING THE 
WAY TO GO. FOR NOW...WILL TREND BACK A LITTLE FROM CURRENT FORECAST 
BUT WILL STILL HANG ON TO AT LEAST A LOW CHANCE FOR THURSDAY INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT GIVEN UNCERTAINTY. WILL CONTINUE WITH SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY IN CONTINUED COLD NWLY FLOW AND THEN TRY TO DRY 
THINGS OUT FOR THE WEEKEND. LOOKS LIKE TEMPS SHOULD REMAIN WELL

235 PM EST SUN JAN 12 2003

MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS FA ATTM BUT SAT PIX SHOWING HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS SPREADING UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST. GFS SEEMS TO HAVE A LITTLE 
BETTER HANDLE ON THIS...KEEPING FAIR AMOUNT OF HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE SOUTH THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT. MEANWHILE CLOUDS SHOULD ALSO 
BE ON THE INCREASE ACROSS THE NORTH LATER TONIGHT AHEAD OF 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL GO WITH PARTLY 
CLOUDY FOR ENTIRE AREA TONIGHT. WITH CLOUDS AND WINDS STAYING UP A 
LITTLE... EXPECT TEMPS A CAT OR TWO WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT AND WILL 
GENERALLY GO WITH LOWS IN THE 15 TO 20 DEGREE RANGE. 

COLD FRONT WILL PUSH DOWN THROUGH FA DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. NOT A 
WHOLE LOT IN THE WAY OF FORCING ALONG THE FRONT AND MOISTURE STILL 
PRETTY LIMITED SO WILL JUST KEEP FLURRIES GOING ACROSS THE FAR NORTH 
WHERE THEY ARE ALREADY IN THE FORECAST. CAA DOES NOT REALLY GET 
GOING ACROSS THE SOUTH TIL THE AFTERNOON SO PREFER TEMPS CLOSER TO 
WARMER FWC NUMBERS FOR HIGHS ON MONDAY. 

ETA AND GFS BOTH SHOWING S/W ENERGY DROPPING DOWN ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES FOR TUESDAY. GFS IS FARTHER SOUTH WITH IT AND INDICATING 
CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS MUCH OF FA WHILE ETA KEEPING THINGS 
MORE TO OUR NORTH AND EAST. DPROG/DT INDICATING THAT ETA IS A LITTLE 
MORE CONSISTENT WITH ITS PLACEMENT SO WILL LEAN THAT WAY FOR NOW AND 
JUST GO WITH SOME FLURRIES IN THE NORTH FOR TUESDAY.

IN THE EXTENDED...GFS CONTINUES TO TREND FARTHER SOUTH AND A LITTLE 
SLOWER WITH S/W MOVING OUT OF THE ROCKIES WITH ASSOCIATED SFC LOW 
NOW MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN GULF STATES AND NORTHERN EDGE OF PRECIP 
SHIELD JUST MAKING IT INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF FA. NEW 12Z UKMET 
LOOKS TO BE EVEN FARTHER SOUTH WITH THIS FEATURE. HOWEVER...ECMWF 
FROM 12Z YESTERDAY ACTUALLY FARTHER NORTH WITH IT THAN PREVIOUS RUN. 
WITH COLD AIR IN PLACE...MORE SOUTHERN TRACK MAY END UP BEING THE 
WAY TO GO. FOR NOW...WILL TREND BACK A LITTLE FROM CURRENT FORECAST 
BUT WILL STILL HANG ON TO AT LEAST A LOW CHANCE FOR THURSDAY INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT GIVEN UNCERTAINTY. WILL CONTINUE WITH SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY IN CONTINUED COLD NWLY FLOW AND THEN TRY TO DRY 
THINGS OUT FOR THE WEEKEND. LOOKS LIKE TEMPS SHOULD REMAIN WELL 
BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

.ILN...NONE.

HIGH PRESSURE OVER MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL SLIDE SLOWLY EAST 
OVERNIGHT...NOSING INTO SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF FA BY 12Z SUN MORNING. 
SCT CU ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF FA SHOULD DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET 
AND ALLOW FOR MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR 
COLDEST TEMP READINGS SO FAR THIS SEASON WITH LOWS GENERALLY DOWN 
INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS. WILL PRETTY MUCH GO WITH LOWS IN THE 5 TO 8 
DEGREE RANGE BUT WITH SOME SNOW COVER STILL PRESENT ACROSS WAPOK 
GROUP...WILL ALLOW FOR ZERO TO 5 ABOVE THERE. 

MOSTLY SUNNY ON SUNDAY AS DRY AIRMASS REMAINS IN PLACE. WINDS BACK

CAT WARMER THAN TODAY. COLD FRONT DROPS DOWN TOWARD FA SUN NIGHT AND 
THEN PUSHES THROUGH AREA DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. NOT A WHOLE LOT

CLEAR SKIES ACROSS AREA THIS MORNING WITH LOWER CLOUDS STILL UP

ACROSS FA. THIS WILL MAKE FOR A TOUGH TEMP FORECAST AS WEAK CAA 
ACTUALLY PRESENT TODAY AT BOTH 925 MB AND 850 MB. LOOKS LIKE SURFACE

MUCH IN WARMING THINGS UP. GUT INSTINCT IS TO CUT BACK TEMPS BUT

AMPLE SUN EXPECTED TODAY (ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH) AS A SOLID LOW TO 
MID LEVEL CLOUD DECK IN THE COLD AIR MOVES OVER CWA FROM N TO S. 
STRONG CAA NOTED ON ALL MODELS WITH NGM BEING MODEL OF CHOICE TO 
EXPLAIN WHERE LEADING EDGE OF CLOUDS WILL BE FOR NEXT SEVERAL 
PERIODS. 

LOW CHANCE POPS STILL EXPECTED IN THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. I THINK A 20% CHANCE N OF OHIO RIVER 
EXISTS ON FRIDAY BUT WILL JUST WORD AS FLURRIES POSSIBLE IN SCNTL 
OHIO GROUPING AND NOT TRI-STATE KCVG GROUPING.

NEXT QUESTION IS HOW LOW WILL WE GO. CAA BOTTOMS OUT BY 0Z SAT 
AROUND -14 WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE THERMAL TROF BTWN 0Z AND 6Z 
FROM NW TO SE. WEAK CAA TO NEUTRAL ADVECTION EXPECTED DURING THE DAY 
SATURDAY SO THIS WILL SET UP A GOOD COLD POOL OVER FCST AREA. SOME 
WEAK WAA SETS UP ON SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL HELP TO CLEAR OUT 
CLOUDS WHICH ARE OVERDONE BY THIS TIME ON THE AVN. AVN IS ALSO A BIT 
TOO COLD WITH -14 AIR AT 12Z SUNDAY. ETAS -8 IS A BIT MORE 
REASONABLE BUT COULD BE SLIGHTLY WARM. 

LOW TEMPS FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE DEWPOINTS HOVERING IN 
THE 5 TO 10 DEGREE RANGE WITH LOWEST DEWPOINTS IN INDIANA. VERY DRY 
AIRMASS ESTABLISHES ITSELF OVER IA/MN AND AXIS TRACKS THROUGH SRN 
IND AND INTO ERN KY. BY 12Z SUNDAY...DEWPOINTS BELOW ZERO ARE 
EXPECTED IN THE SOUTHWEST AND AROUND ZERO TO THE NORTHEAST. 

MODELS DIVERGE IN SFC PATTERN AT THIS TIME. WILL KEY OFF OF THE ETA 
SINCE AVN HASNT HANDLED ITSELF WELL OVER MY FCST AREA LATELY. THIS 
WOULD PUSH HIGH PRESSURE INTO ERN KY AND THE RIDGE MIGHT GET INTO 
SRN FCST AREA FOR AN ALMOST PERFECT RADIATIONAL COOLING NIGHT. BOTH 
ETA AND AVN SUGGEST SOME WAA AT H8 FROM 0 TO 12Z SUNDAY WHICH WILL 
JUST CLEAR OUT ANY LEFTOVER CLOUD COVER. COLDEST AIRMASS THIS YEAR 
EXPECTED SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL GO WITH AVN GUIDANCE BECAUSE ITS 
COLDER BUT I LIKE THE MASS FIELDS BETTER FROM THE ETA. EXPECT 0 TO 
+5 IN INDIANA, AROUND 5 DEGREES OR THE UPPER SINGLE DIGITS ELSEWHERE 
FOR LOWS. THIS AIRMASS WILL CUT HIGHS ON BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY, 
SUNSHINE WILL NOT NOTICEABLY KEEP US WARM AND EXPECT TO UNDERCUT MAV 
GUIDANCE HERE.

MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK. COLD FRONT 
WILL BE DROPPING SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA TOMORROW. LOOKS LIKE LOW 
CLOUDS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL LAG THE BOUNDARY BY SEVERAL 
HOURS. SO TEMPERATURES SHOULD HAVE A CHANCE TO RISE IN THE MORNING. 

LOW LEVEL WIND DIRECTION DOES NOT LOOK TOO FAVORABLE FOR ANY LAKE 
BANDS TO MAKE IT INTO THE AREA BUT FAIRLY GOOD SHORT WAVE WILL BE 
SWINGING DOWN ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON FRIDAY. SO WILL KEEP A 
CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS FOR NORTHERN ZONES FOR THE LATER PART OF 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUING INTO FRIDAY. RIDGING WILL WORK IN FROM 
THE WEST BEGINNING FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH SHOULD HELP ERODE THE LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE.

ALTHOUGH WINDS SHOULD STAY UP OVERNIGHT EXPECT SKIES TO BE MAINLY 
CLEAR. WITH SOME REMAINING SNOW COVER IN NORTHERN AREA COULD SEE A 
FAIRLY DECENT RANGE IN LOWS. FORECAST RANGES FROM CLOSER TO COOLER 
GUIDANCE IN THE NORTH TO CLOSER TO THE WARMER GUIDANCE IN THE SOUTH. 
THURSDAYS HIGHS ARE OBVIOUSLY DEPENDENT ON HOW SOON COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WILL STOP THE DIURNAL RISE. HAVE COMPROMISED BETWEEN 
PREVIOUS FORECAST AND WARMER MAV NUMBERS. GUIDANCE IS FAIRLY CLOSE 
FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY AND HAVE NOT STRAYED TOO FAR.

NEXT CHANCE OF LIGHT SNOW FOR THE ENTIRE AREA WILL BE MONDAY WITH A 
REINFORCING COLD FRONT ALTHOUGH MOISTURE IS RATHER LIMITED IN THE 
ARCTIC AIRMASS THAT SETTLES IN OVER THE WEEKEND. BETTER CHANCE 
APPEARS TO BE WEDNESDAY WITH LOW PRESSURE MOVING INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY. BUT DETAILS THAT FAR IN ADVANCE ARE OBVIOUSLY SKETCHY AT

LOOKS LIKE THE WARMER ETA WAS THE WAY TO GO WITH YDAS FCST AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO BELIEVE THAT THE GFS IS SIGNIFICANTLY TOO COLD WITH H8 
TEMPS AND RESULTING CLOUD COVER IN CAA. THIS DISCREPANCY CONTINUES 
INTO THE SHORT TERM OF THE FCST AND WILL KEEP THE THINKING THAT 
WARMER (AND DRIER) IS BETTER.

NEXT CHANCE FOR PRECIP IS NOTED THURS PM ON MOST MODELS, BUT MOSTLY 
ON GFS. CURRENT FCST HAS A 30 POP FOR SHSN THURS PM THROUGH FRI PM 
IN ENTIRE FCST AREA AND I FEEL THAT THIS IS A BIT OVERDONE. WILL CUT 
BACK ACROSS THE BOARD AND EXPECT THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHSN TO BE 
EARLY FRI IN THE CMH PORTION OF FCST AREA WITH PASSAGE OF SFC LOW. 
BEST UVV IS NOTED AT H8 FROM 12-18Z IN NE OH. WILL KEEP 30 POPS OF 
SHSN IN CMH HERE. REST OF FCST WILL CUT BACK TO FLURRIES POSSIBLE, 
AND LEAVE THEM OUT ENTIRELY IN THE SOUTHERN FCST AREA.

TEMPS WILL BE TRICKY, ESPECIALLY ON FRIDAY WHERE CAA WILL BE KING 
AND 12Z SAT TEMPS DIP INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS. WILL NOT GO QUITE THIS 
COLD BUT CLOUD COVER SHOULD BE SCANT HERE (EVEN USING THE GFS). 
BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME WIND TO STOP A TRUE RADIATIONAL 
COOLING NIGHT. NRN FCST AREA ON FRIDAY WILL LIKELY HAVE STEADY OR 
SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS IN THE DAYTIME FRIDAY WITH CLOUDY SKIES. WILL 
SEE WHAT IGR COMES UP WITH IN WORDING.

SAT PIX SHOWING A FEW BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ACROSS NE INDIANA AND NW 
OHIO BUT FOR THE MOST PART...FAIRLY SOLID CLOUD DECK STILL EXTENDING 
BACK ACROSS MUCH OF INDIANA. LOW LEVEL FLOW PROGGED TO BACK 
OVERNIGHT WITH 8H THERMAL TROF SHIFTING OFF TO THE EAST. THIS WOULD 
TEND TO SUGGEST THAT CLEARING WOULD PUSH EAST ACROSS MUCH OF FA 
OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...FORECAST SOUNDINGS HANGING ON TO MOISTURE IN 
THE LOW LEVEL SO THINK CLOUDS MAY NOT CLEAR ALL THAT QUICKLY. WILL 
KEEP CLOUDY CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT AND INDICATE PARTIAL CLEARING IN 
THE WEST LATE. THIS WILL PRESENT A CHALLENGE FOR THE TEMP FORECAST 
OVERNIGHT. WITH CLOUDS...WILL GO A LITTLE WARMER THAN GUID FOR MOST 
AREAS. EXCEPTION WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHWEST WHERE SOME CLEARING 
LATE AND SNOW COVER MAY ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP OFF MORE. 

A FEW FLURRIES ONGOING RIGHT NOW AND WILL MAKE A LAST SECOND 
DECISION ON HOW TO HANDLE THAT IN THE FORECAST AS WE COULD SEE THIS 
LINGER INTO THE OVERNIGHT. FCST SOUNDINGS SHOWING SATURATION UP TO 
ABOUT THE -10 ISOTHERM TOO SO AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT SOME 
PATCHY FZDZ BUT WILL NOT MENTION IN FCST ATTM.  

CLIPPER SYSTEM THEN PROGGED TO DROP DOWN TOWARD FA DURING THE DAY ON 
SATURDAY AND PUSH ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY 
MORNING. WAA PATTERN DEVELOPING OUT AHEAD OF IT ON SATURDAY AND 
COULD SEE SOME CLEARING AND SOME PSBL SUN DURING THE MORNING BUT 
SHOULD SEE CLOUDS FILL BACK IN THROUGH THE AFTERNOON WITH APPROACH 
OF SYSTEM. ETA A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH AND FASTER WITH VORT THAN GFS 
WITH ETA ACTUALLY SHOWING PRETTY FAVORABLE VORT TRACK FOR A CLIPPER 
SYSTEM FOR OUR AREA. THINK ETA HAS SWATH OF BETTER PCPN A LITTLE TOO 
FAR NORTH AS PCPN WITH THESE TYPES OF SYSTEMS GENERALLY CLOSER TO 
VORT TRACK. GFS FURTHER SOUTH WITH TRACK AND THUS WITH SWATH OF 
BETTER PCPN BUT THIS TOO LOOKS TO BE TOO FAR DISPLACED NORTH BASED 
ON TRACK OF ITS VORT. ETA 295K ISENTROPIC SUFCAES SHOWING A QUICK 
SHOT OF DECENT LIFT FROM 00Z TO 06Z SAT NIGHT. MEANWHILE...MODIFIED 
LEMO TECHNIQUE OFF THE ETA GIVES A MAX OF 2.8 INCHES...WITH AVN 
CLOSER TO 2 INCHES. THEREFORE THINK PARTS OF FA COULD SEE 1 TO 2 
INCHES WITH AN ISOLATED THREE INCH REPORT BUT WITH FINAL TRACK STILL 
UP IN THE AIR...WILL NOT TRY TO GET TOO DETAILED IN THE THIRD PERIOD 
AND WILL JUST GO WITH LIKELY POPS FOR SAT NIGHT AND INDICATE AROUND 
AN INCH OF ACCUM. ONE OTHER CONCERN IS PRECIP TYPE. ETA A LITTLE 
WARMER THAN GFS WITH MORE NORTHERN TRACK AND HINTING TOWARD A 
POSSIBLE MIX WITH RAIN FOR CVG AREA. EVEN WITH THAT THOUGH...WOULD 
EXPECT PREVAILING PRECIP TO REMAIN SNOW WITH SOME DYNAMIC PRESENT SO 
WILL JUST SAY SNOW LIKELY...POSSIBLY MIXING WITH RAIN AT TIMES.

GFS AND TO A LESSER EXTENT ETA SHOWING SECONDARY VORT MAX DROPPING 
DOWN QUICKLY FOR SUN INTO SUN NIGHT. THIS VORT NOT AS IMPRESSIVE AS 
FIRST ONE BUT STILL GOOD ENOUGH TO CONTINUE CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS 
THROUGH SUN NIGHT AND LINGER A CHANCE IN THE EAST INTO MONDAY 
MORNING. 

IN THE EXTENDED...LOOKS LIKE A BRIEF WARMUP FOR MID WEEK BEFORE NEXT 
SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR MOVES BACK IN FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. REMOVED

UPR LOW AND ASSOCD VORTICITY WILL PIVOT NE TOWARD THE MIDDLE OHIO 
VLY OVERNIGHT.  CWFA WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN A DISCONNECTED REGION 
WITH LOWER LVL CONV/UPR LVL DYNAMICS.  UPR DYNAMICS WILL BE GREATEST 
ACRS THE SOUTH WITH THE BEST LOW LVL CONV ACRS THE ERN CWFA WITH AN 
INVERTED SFC TROF.  ELSEWHERE IN THE NW...WEAK 850 MB CONV WILL ONLY 
BRING A CHC OF SNOW SHOWERS.  PCPN FOR THE MOST PART OVERNIGHT WILL 
BE IN THE FORM OF SNOW...EXCEPT IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST WHERE IT 
WILL TAKE A GRADUAL CHANCE AFTER MIDNIGHT TOWARD MORNING.  NO MORE 
THAN ONE INCH OF SNOW IS EXPECTED ACRS THE SOUTH AND EAST.

ON FRIDAY...UPR LOW PIVOTS AWAY AND ASSOCD PCPN WILL END.  TEMPS 
WILL BE ON THE COOL SIDE...IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S.

CLOUDY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY...DESPITE WEAK H5 RIDGING.  LOW LVL MSTR WILL BE SLOW 
TO CLEAR...AND MID AND HIGH LVL MSTR WILL SPILL RAPIDLY FROM ALBERTA 
TYPE CLIPPER SYSTEM ON SATURDAY.  AS THIS SYSTEM PIVOTS INTO THE 
OHIO VLY SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...A CHANCE OF SNOW IS EXPECTED.

CONTINUE TO HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE IN THE EXTENDED FCST.  IT IS 
APPARENT WE WILL BE IN AN ACTIVE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.  HOWEVER 
...LONG RANGE MODELS KEEP FLIP-FLOPPING ON EXACT H5 LOW/SFC LOW 
LOCATIONS.  THIS WILL SIGNIFICANTLY AFFECT PCPN TYPE.  WILL GO WITH 
PREVIOUS 00Z GFS SOLUTION ATTM AND NOT FLIP-FLOP WITH CURRENT 12Z

RADAR TRENDS SHOWING SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS MOST OF AREA ATTM 
BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE A DIMINISHING TREND IN COVERAGE. SURFACE LOW 
IS STARTING TO SHIFT OFF TO THE EAST ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED UPPER

EXPECT DIMINSHING TREND TO CONTINUE THROUGH THIS EVENING. WILL ALLOW 
PCPN TO END EARLY WITH OTHERWISE CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT. TEMPS 
HOVERING RIGHT AROUND FREEZING ACROSS THE WAPOK AREA BUT WITH 
WEAKENING TREND...WILL PROBABLY ALLOW CURRENT WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORY TO EXPIRE AT 4 PM AND LEAVE JUST A CHANCE OF A PSBL MIX 
WITH FREEZING RAIN EARLY.

ETA/GFS IN DECENT AGGREEMENT WITH TRACK OF 8H LOW FOR NEXT SYSTEM 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND THURSDAY NIGHT...TAKING LOW FROM S CNTRL 
INDIANA AROUND 18Z THURS UP INTO NRN OHIO THROUGH 12Z FRIDAY 
MORNING. SURFACE REFLECTION NOT QUITE AS STRONG AS WITH RECENT

DECENT SHOT OF ISENT LIFT SHOWN ON THE 295 K SURFACES FROM 18Z THRU 
00Z BEFORE CUTTING OFF...BUT THEN WITH AREA OF BETTER LOW LEVEL

3 TO 5 INCHES POSSIBLE ACROSS WAPOK AREA THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT WITH 
1 TO 3 JUST SOUTH OF THERE ACROSS RICHMOND AND DAYTON AREAS. WILL 
LEAVE CURRENT WINTER STORM WATCH UP FOR NORTHERN MIAMI VALLEY FOR 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND THURSDAY NIGHT.

OTHER CONCERN IS PCPN TYPE FOR THURSDAY. ETA HAS TRENDED CLOSER TO 
COOLER GFS BUT BOTH INDICTG A POSSIBLE MIX ACROSS THE SE FOR 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS BOUNDARY LAYER REMAINS ABOVE FREEZING. WILL GO 
AHEAD AND JUST MENTION THE MIX FOR PMH AREA THOUGH SNOW MAY BRIEFLY

AREAS NEAR LIMA AND SOME CO0P STATIONS ARE NEAR OR BELOW FZ.  WITH

AREA WILL HAVE RA TODAY BUT WILL MENTION POSSIBLE FZRA FOR DAY 
ZONE...ALTHOUGH TEMPS WILL LIKELY STAY JUST ABOVE FZ FOR THE 
DURATION OF PCPN...AS THE RAIN ENDS FROM WEST TO EAST THIS AFTERNOON 
INTO EVENING.  

THE AREA WILL GET A RESPITE FROM RAIN/WINTER WX TONIGHT BEFORE THE 
NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES FROM THE PLAINS ON THURSDAY.  THE ETA IS  
SLOWER AND FARTHER SOUTH WITH THE 5H LOW THAN THE GFS IS.  IN 
ADDITION...THE GFS IS NOW MUCH COLDER AT 850 MB THAN THE ETA.  AT 
850 MB FOR 0Z FRIDAY...THE ETA 0 C ISOTHERM IS ACROSS THE SE FCST 
AREA WHILE THE GFS HAS -4 C THERE.  IN FACT..THE 0Z MAV GUIDANCE IS 
MUCH COOLER THAN THE 12Z WAS.  

THE GENERAL TREND WITH THE LAST FEW SYSTEMS HAS SOMEWHAT FAVORED THE 
GFS TRACK BUT THE QPF HAS BEEN UNDERDONE...AND HAS BEEN CLOSER TO 
THE ETA.  LOOKING AT THE ETA 295 K SFC...THE BEST LIFT WILL OCCUR 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN THE NW FCST.  USING THE GARCIA METHOD AND 
CONSIDERING ETA QPF...IT APPEARS THAT 3 TO 5 INCHES COULD ACCUMULATE 
HERE...WHICH NECESSITATES A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR THIS AREA FOR
