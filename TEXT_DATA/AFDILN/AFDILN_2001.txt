MESOETA SFC TEMPS AND AVN MAV/SFC TEMPS CONTINUE TO BE INFLUENCED BY

*********************************************************************

ALBEIT THE SHORT TERM FCST INVOLVES CHC/S OF FLURRIES AND 
CLDS...STILL DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT...SO WILL DO MY BEST.

18Z SFC ANALYSIS INDICATES A WEAK SFC TROF REFLECTION ACRS ERN AND 
SE OHIO.  KILN RADAR HAS SHOWN THAT THE FLURRIES HAVE ENDED ACRS THE 
REGION AS DRIER AIR IS NOW CURRENTLY WORKING INTO THE WRN CWFA.  
MEANWHILE...IN THE UPPER ATMOSPHERE...AS PORTRAYED ON CURRENT WATER 
VAPOR IMAGERY...UPR POLAR VORTEX CONTINUES TO SPIN EAST OF JAMES BAY 
WITH WEAK AREAS OF SHEAR VORTICITY SPINNING AROUND ITS CENTER.  ONE 
AREA OF SHEAR VORTICITY IS CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER SE SD INTO

WEAK SFC TROF COMBINED WITH STRONG WAA BETWEEN 925 MB AND 850 MB 
WERE NOT REFLECTED IN THE MESOETA MODEL AT ALL...AND KILN 12Z 
SOUNDING COMPARED TO THE MODEL GIVES CREDENCE TO THIS.  THESE 
FACTORS SEEM TO HAVE BEEN THE REASON FOR THE FLURRIES LAST NIGHT

TONIGHT?  BELIEVE THE MESOETA SHOULD HAVE THE TREND OF DECREASING 
925 MB RH INTO W CNTRL OHIO AND SE INDIANA CORRECT ATTM...COMPARED 
TO WHAT IS GOING ON CURRENT VISIBLE IMAGERY.  CASE IN POINT:  FLOW 
AT 925 MB AND 850 MB IS COMING OFF OF LAKE MICHIGAN INTO NE 
INDIANA.  HOWEVER...THERE HAS BEEN A DECREASE IN CLOUDS/SNOW SHOWERS 
THERE...GIVING ME SOME CONFIDENCE THAT DRIER AIR IS IN PLACE TO THE 
NORTHWEST OF HERE ATTM.  THE BIG BUGABOO IS THAT THIS DRIER AIR IS 
SLOW TO MOVE IN...AND WHERE THERE ARE CLOUDS NOW (SUCH AS IN THE 
EAST AND SOUTH)...THEY MAY HOLD ON OVERNIGHT UNDER A STRONG 
INVERSION (IF IT STILL EXITS ATTM).  I AM PLANNING ON GOING MOSTLY 
CLEAR DAY AND CVG GROUPS AND PARTLY CLOUDY ELSEWHERE...LETTING THE 
EVENING SHIFT OBSERVE SATELLITE TRENDS TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS.

ON TUESDAY...ALL MODELS SHOW A GRADUAL INCREASE IN 925 MB AND 850 MB 
MSTR ACRS THE NRN CWFA.  HOWEVER...WE DO NOT HAVE ANY SHEAR 
VORTICITY ALOFT...AND MODEL SOUNDING ADJUSTMENTS ARE NOT YIELDING AN 
LOW LVL INSTABILITY LAYER.  WILL LEAVE CHC OF FLURRIES OUT OF THE 
FCST FOR TOMORROW.

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE H5 UPR AIR PATTERN 
TRIES TO COMBINE S/WV ENERGY FROM THE SRN BRANCH OF THE JET STREAM 
WITH AN H5 TROF FROM THE NRN STREAM...PRODUCING A SIGNIFICANT STORM 
ACRS THE SE U. S. AND MID ATLANTIC.  FOR THE OHIO VLY...WE GET 
CAUGHT IN A WEAK LOW LVL DEFORMATION ZONE...AS PORTRAYED BY THE

ALSO...A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES BY 
SATURDAY.  BASED ON PAST EXPERIENCE OF GULF LOWS...THE SPINE OF THE

EITHER TAKE A MORE WESTERLY TRACK IF H5 TROF DIGS ENOUGH...OR A 
WEAKER SFC LOW OVER THE SE U. S. WILL TRANSITION OVER TO A

KILN RADAR THIS MORNING SHOWS 12 TO 16 DBZ ECHO RETURNS.  THESE 
VALUES WERE ASSOCD WITH LIGHT SNOW FLURRIES...WHICH ARE CONTINUING 
HERE AT ILN AND EAST INTO S CNTRL OHIO.

UNLIKE YESTERDAY...06Z MESOETA IS INDICATING A LITTLE MORE BOUNDARY 
LAYER MSTR FOR TODAY.  THE NGM...ON THE OTHER HAND...IS DRIER.  THIS 
IS NO SURPRISE AS THE MESOETA TENDS TO BE TOO MOIST AND THE NGM 
TENDS TO BE TOO DRY.  SO THE QUESTION TO ASK IS:  HOW MUCH MSTR WILL 
BE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER THIS AFTERNOON?  RIGHT NOW..AM LEANING 
TOWARD A MORE MOIST SOLUTION AS 12Z ILN SOUNDING INDICATES A 2.5 C 
SPREAD AT 925 MB.  IF THIS HOLDS TRUE...WE SHOULD SEE AN EXPANSION

H5 SHEAR VORTICITY OCCURRING ALOFT ACRS THE REGION THIS AFTN 
COMBINED WITH SHALLOW INSTABILITY AND CYCLONIC FLOW...CUMULUS MAY 
SQUEEZE OUT A FEW FLURRIES.  AT THIS POINT...WILL CONTINUE A CHANCE 
OF FLURRIES IN THE ERN ZONES AS THEY ARE ALREADY ON THE EDGE OF 
DEEPER MOISTURE (AND FLURRIES ARE HAPPENING THERE ATTM).  FOR THE

BEFORE I AM CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO INCLUDE.

KILN 12Z SOUNDING YIELDS 20 DEGREES IN FULL SUNSHINE.  WITH SOME

ASSOCIATION WITH E-W ORIENTED MID LVL S/W AND CLD FRONTAL BDRY. IT 
IS THIS WX MAKER THAT WILL MAKE ITS PRESENCE FELT LATER TONIGHT 
ACROSS THE SWRN PORTION OF OUR FA. MODELS STILL INDICATING THAT THE 
BEST FORCING WILL REMAIN S-SW OF OUR AREA...BUT Q-VECTOR ANALYSIS 
SUGGEST SOME ENHANCED FORCING TO REACH INTO THE SRN PORTION OF OUR 
FA LATER TONIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW. WITH THIS IN MIND WILL CONTINUE

18Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A SFC TROF FROM CNTRL MI SW INTO CNTRL 
INDIANA AND S CNTRL ILLINOIS.  THIS SFC TROF...IN CONJUNCTION WITH 
S/WV ENERGY NOTED ON WATER VAPOR...WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SCATTERED 
SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY NOW OCCURRING ACRS THE WAPAKONETA...DAYTON AND 
COLUMBUS REGIONS.  RADAR TRENDS HAVE SHOWN THE SNOW SHOWERS PIVOTING 
TO THE NORTH...BUT THEY NOW SEEM TO HAVE STOPPED THEIR NORTHWARD 
PROGRESSION.  WILL KEEP SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS IN THE FCST FOR THE 
NRN TWO THIRDS OF THE CWFA THIS EVENING WHILE THE FAR SOUTH WILL 
REMAIN DRY.  VISIBILITIES WITH THE SNOW SHOWERS HAVE BEEN RANGING 
FROM 1 1/2 MILES TO 5 MILES.  THUS...I AM NOT EXPECTING ANY 
SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS.  WILL JUST MENTION LITTLE ACCUMULATION 
EXPECTED.

FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT AND INTO SATURDAY...A WEAK ARCTIC 
FRONT...NOW LOCATED FROM NRN MICHIGAN SW INTO SRN WI AND SRN IOWA 
WILL MOVE SE INTO NORTHWEST OHIO BY MORNING.  ASSOCD S/WV ENERGY 
WITH THE ARCTIC FRONT...LOCATED OVER SOUTH DAKOTA ATTM...WILL ALSO 
DIVE SE INTO THE OHIO VLY BY 12Z SATURDAY.  MODELS...ESPECIALLY THE 
MESOETA...SHOW DEEP LIFT FROM THE 700 MB TO 300 MB LEVELS VIA Q 
VECTOR ANALYSIS FROM LATE TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING.  
ALSO...DEEP MOISTURE DEVELOPS ACRS THE REGION...ESPECIALLY ACRS THE 
SOUTH.  THE STRONGEST LIFT IS PROGGED NEAR AND SOUTH OF THE OHIO 
RIVER WITH WEAKER LIFT AS ONE MOVES NORTH.  WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL 
BRING A CHANCE OF SNOW TO ALL LOCATIONS LATE TONIGHT AND AGAIN ON 
SATURDAY.  WILL MENTION AN INCH OR LESS OF ACCUMULATION ACRS SRN 
ZONES WITH LITTLE ACCUMULATION EXPECTED ACRS THE NORTH.  AREAS OF 
SNOW WILL TAPER OFF TO SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS BY AFTERNOON AS CAA 
AND A SHALLOW UNSTABLE SOUNDING TAKE OVER.

BY SATURDAY NIGHT...LOW LEVELS BEGIN TO DRY OUT.  WILL ONLY KEEP 
SOME EVENING FLURRIES IN THE NORTH...OTHERWISE PARTLY CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS SHOULD SUFFICE.

ON SUNDAY...AVN/MESOETA SHOW CONTINUED DRYING IN THE LOW LEVELS.  
WILL GO MOSTLY SUNNY...EXCEPT ACRS THE FAR NORTH WHERE SOME MOISTURE 
OFF OF LAKE MICHIGAN MAY ALLOW FOR CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT.

ONLY TWEAKED MOS GUIDANCE VALUES UPWARD FOR TONIGHT...AND THEN 
PRETTY MUCH USED A SPLIT BETWEEN THE MOS/MAV GUIDANCE (WHICH FALLS 
IN LINE WITH 2 METER SFC MESOETA TEMPS).

.ILN...NONE.

CONTINUITY EVEN WITH VORTS ROTATING AROUND LOW. THIS LATEST VORT IS 
PIVOTING TO MORE N-S ORIENTATION AND IS KEEPING CLOUDS AND FLURRIES 
OUT OF MOST OF CWFA. BUT THE CLOUDS SHOULD REDEVELOP AFTER SUNRISE 
INVOF TROF SO WILL MENTION MORNING SUN THEN BECOMING MOCLDY. WILL 
ALSO BACK OF ON SNOW WORDING TO FLURRIES MOST AREAS.

UPPER LOW WILL REMAIN CUTOFF THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH VORT 
LOBES ROTATING AROUND IT.

FIRST VORT TO WORRY ABOUT IS OVER ERN IA/WRN IL ATTM.  VSBYS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE VORT WHERE 2 TO 3 MILE IN SNOW.  THIS FEATURE IS 
AT THE 850 MB LEVEL...AND THE ETA HAD A NICE HANDLE ON IT AT 18Z.  
THE ETA SWINGS THE FEATURE INTO WESTERN OHIO AROUND 18Z...SPREADING 
SOME 850 RH IN THE FA.  THE VORT SHEARS NORTHEAST DURING THE 
DAY...BUT WITH 850 TEMPS BELOW -12C...SHOULD BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT 
SOME FLURRIES OR SNOW SHOWERS.

AHEAD OF THE VORT TONIGHT...WINDS WILL BACK BRINGING IN DRIER AIR.  
SKIES SHOULD GO MOSTLY CLEAR.  NEW MOS NUMBERS CLOSE TO CURRENT 
FORECAST...SO LITTLE CHANGE ON LOWS TONIGHT.

ANOTHER SHOT OF CAA AFFECTS THE FA BEHIND THE INITIAL VORT.  WILL 
CONTINUE WITH MENTION OF SNOW SHOWERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

BEST ORGANIZED VORT OF FORECAST PERIOD AFFECTS THE FA THURSDAY.  AVN 
DIGS THE VORT RIGHT ACROSS CVG BETWEEN 12Z-18Z THURSDAY.  LEMO WOULD 
INDICATE AROUND 1.5 INCHES.  THE ETA IS FARTHER SOUTHWEST WITH THE 
VORT...TAKING IT OVER SDF.  THE NEW 18Z AVN IS A LITTLE FARTHER 
SOUTHWEST.  WAS THINKING ABOUT GOING LIKELY POPS...BUT WILL ONLY
INCREASE POPS TO 50 IN THE SOUTHWEST.

PREFER THE COOLER TEMPERATURES OF THE CURRENT FORECAST...COMPARED TO

COLD FRONT IS CURRENTLY CROSSING OUR CWA NEARING ILN AT 16Z.  PRECIP 
IS EXITING WITH THE FRONT.  TEMPS HAVE ALREADY FALLEN INTO 30S AT

NEARLY PARALLEL WITH UPPER FLOW AND THERE IS A WAVE TO THE SOUTH 
WHICH MAY BE HELPING TO SLOW IT. FRONT SHOULD BE THROUGH THE AREA BY 
21Z AS UPPER TROF AXIS PROGRESSES EASTWARD TOWARD OUR AREA.

THANKS TO IWX FOR COORD.

AM CONCERNED ABOUT TRACK OF THE LOW THROUGH FCST AREA TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. MODELS ARE COMING TOGETHER AND IT LOOKS LIKE A HEAVY RAINER 
BEGINNING TONIGHT INTO MONDAY. HOWEVER...MODELS ARE TRENDING TOWARDS 
PREVIOUS AVN SOLUTION...WHICH IS A BIT FURTHER SOUTHEAST WITH THE 
TRACK OF THE LOW. GUT FEELING IS THAT PREVIOUS RUNS OF THE AVN HAD 
THE SFC LOW TRACK A BIT FURTHER NW AND THAT THE BEST CHANCE FOR 
HEAVY RAIN WILL BE HERE. PRECIP EFFICIENCIES ARE ALSO NOTED THE BEST 
HERE OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...WITH AXIS OF BEST PWAT 1.5 STAYING OVER 
SRN CWA. 

WILL SPLIT THE MINOR DIFFERENCE IN THE MODELS AND LESSEN THE CHANCE 
OF RAIN IN THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST TODAY...AND EXPECT THE HEAVIEST 
RAINS TONIGHT IN THE NORTHWEST. AM RELUCTANT TO GO WITH A 2ND PERIOD 
WATCH AS AXIS OF HEAVY RAIN COULD TRACK FURTHER SOUTHEAST AND AFFECT 
CENTRAL PORTIONS OF CWA FROM SW-NE AS OPPOSED TO MAINLY THE NW. 
HOWEVER...HEAVY WORDING WILL BE NOTED FOR WESTERN CWA IN ZONES. 
CATEGORICAL POPS TONIGHT AND MONDAY EXPECTED FOR ENTIRE FCST 
AREA...AS ANY OF THE PROJECTED TRACKS OF THE LOW WOULD BRING A NICE 
SHOT OF RAIN WITH THE GULF WIDE OPEN. 

CURRENT FCST SEEMS TO HAVE THINGS WELL IN HAND...WILL TREND WARMER 
THAN GUIDANCE TONIGHT AND TOMORROW AS WARM SECTOR ENTERS CWA. 

.ILN...NONE.

THERMAL TROF SKIMMING OVER NERN CWA THIS MORNING SHOULD BE E OF FCST 
AREA BY 12Z AND CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST. WEAK TEMPERATURE INCREASE AT 
H9 (ONLY ABOUT A DEGREE FROM 18-0Z) IS INDICATIVE OF THE AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE THATS HANGING AROUND AT THIS LEVEL DURING THE DAY. H8 TEMP 
RISES QUITE A BIT MORE THROUGH SAME TIME FRAME (5 DEGREES) IN 
RESPONSE TO BUILDING THERMAL RIDGE. BY 12Z SUNDAY...THERMAL RIDGE IS 
WEST OF CWA RUNNING N-S AS SFC WAVE DEVELOPS AHEAD OF H5 TROF.

PROBLEM HERE IS THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE ADVECTION SHOWN AS INCREASED 
1000-500 RH OVERSPREADING OHIO SW-NE BY 0Z MON. AVN WANTS TO DEVELOP 
THIS AS A WAVE SETTLING OVER OHIO FOR ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE CENTER TO 
RIDE ALONG. OTHER MODELS INDICATE A MORE OPEN WAVE VS CUTOFF LOW... 
AND EXPECT TO TAKE A SPLIT BETWEEN THE MODELS AFTER SUNDAY. AM 
RELUCTANT TO CONTINUE THE FCST AS A STRONG CUTOFF LOW FROM THE AVN 
FOR MONDAY...BUT THE RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IS UNCANNY. OTHER MODELS 
KEEP AN OPEN WAVE AND WOULD SEE RIDGING BUILD IN FROM THE NORTHWEST 
WHICH IS SHOWN BEST ON THE CANADIEN. PMDHMD HAS ONLY TOUCHED ON THIS 
THROUGH SUNDAY...BUT HAVE NOTED THAT A SLOWER SOLUTION WITH A MORE 
OPEN TROF WOULD BE PRUDENT FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK AS STRONG RIDGE OVER 
THE EAST IS STILL DOMINANT. WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND LEAN 
TOWARDS AN ETA/AVN COMPROMISE FOR MONDAY. CONFIDENCE DROPS OFF 
SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER THIS...SO NO CHANGES TO FCST AFTER MONDAY.

PROBLEM FOR TODAY WILL BE TEMPS WHICH RELY ON THE CLOUD COVER. ETA 
IS OPTIMISTIC ON CURU TODAY...AND A NUMBER OF SUCKER HOLES ARE 
SHOWING UP IN THE LLVL CLOUD DECK TO THE WEST JUST WEST OF THE SFC 
HI ALONG ILL/IN LINE. WILL EXPECT SOME OF THESE BREAKS OVER CWA 
TODAY...ESPECIALLY TO THE WEST. WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
FWC AND MAV GUIDANCE WITH THE THINKING OF AN EARLIER BREAK IN CLOUD 
COVER AND LITTLE TO NO CU DEVELOPING IN THE OPEN PATCHES. ETA TEMPS 
LOOK MORE REALISTIC THAN NGM WHICH SUPPORTS TEMPS WARMER THAN FWC... 
ESPECIALLY WITH LESS CLOUDS. WILL ALSO LEAN TOWARDS WARMER AVN 
GUIDANCE TONIGHT...THIS IS IN LINE WITH CURRENT FCST. TEMPS ON 
SUNDAY SHOULD BE CLOSE TO GUIDANCE...AND CLOUDS SHOULD BE THE RULE 
OF THE DAY. THERMAL RIDGE SHOULD BRING INCREASING TEMPERATURES 
OVERNIGHT SUNDAY...AND FWC DOESNT NOTE THIS. WILL BE QUITE A BIT 
WARMER WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS OCCURRING EARLY. 

IN ALL...MINOR CHANGES EXPECTED TO FCST...NOTE INCREASING TEMPS SUN 
NIGHT AND WILL BUMP READINGS A LITTLE ON MONDAY AS WE SHOULD SPEND 
SOME TIME IN THE WARM SECTOR. WILL CUT BACK TO CHANCE POPS MON IN 
NORTHWEST BUT AM CONCERNED ABOUT POSSIBLE WRAP AROUND IF AVN 
SOLUTION WORKS. IF SYSTEMS SLOW DOWN DUE TO MEAN RIDGE TO THE 
EAST...WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS IN EARLY MON PM FOR EVERYONE BUT 
THE NORTHWEST WHERE RIDGE WOULD BUILD IN FIRST.

FIRST CONCERN THIS AFTERNOON IS THE WIND ADVISORY ACRS THE ERN 
CWFA.  
SFC LOW PRESSURE NEAR MNN WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE OFF TO THE NORTHEAST 
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AS WELL AS THE ATTACHED COLD 
FRONT (EXTENDING SOUTH FROM JUST EAST OF CMH AND JUST WEST OF HTS).  
THERE WILL BE ABOUT A TWO HOUR PERIOD OF VERY GUSTY WINDS...FOLLOWED 
BY A RAPID DECREASE IN THE WIND SPEED AS THE SFC LOW MOVES AWAY.  
MAY HOLD ZONES UNTIL 430 PM TO SEE HOW THE WINDS ARE DOING (I.E. MAY 
CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORY BEFORE 6 PM).  WE SHALL SEE.

OTHERWISE...SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL WEDGE INTO THE REGION FROM THE 
WEST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY OVERNIGHT.  ALL MODELS ARE SHOWING (AND 
VISIBLE SATELLITE CONFIRMS) THAT LOW LEVEL MSTR WILL BE FOUND ACRS 
THE REGION OVERNIGHT.  THUS...MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES LOOK GOOD.  
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER AND MID 30S.

ON SATURDAY...AM A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT LOW LVL MSTR MAY STICK 
AROUND LONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT.  THUS...WILL ERROR ON THE 
SIDE OF CAUTION AND WILL ALLOW SKIES TO BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY INSTEAD 
OF MOSTLY SUNNY BY SATURDAY AFTN.  MIDNIGHT SHIFT SHOULD HAVE A 
BETTER HANDLE ON THIS.  WITH LOW CONFIDENCE OF CLOUD 
DISSIPATION...WILL GO WITH MOS VALUES FOR HIGHS.

ONCE AGAIN...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE OUT OF THE PLAIN STATES INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY.  THE MODELS HAVE NOT DONE WELL 
THIS WEEK IN DETERMINING SFC LOWS RIPPLING FROM THE SOUTHWEST ALONG 
THE COLD FRONTS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  CASE IN POINT IS THE MRF.  
TWO RUNS AGO...DEEP SFC LOW PRESSURE WAS LOCATED OVER WRN PA BY 12Z 
MON.  ONE RUN AGO...DEEP SFC LOW PRESSURE WAS LOCATED ACRS ERN 
WISCONSIN BY 12Z MON.  MOST CURRENT MRF RUN SHOWS A MUCH WEAKER SFC 
LOW RIPPLING INTO ERN KY BY 12Z MON.  NOW THE FRI 12Z AVN MODEL 
SHOWS A WEAK SFC LOW RIPPLING THROUGH CNTRL KENTUCKY BY 12Z MON.   
AM CONFIDENT THAT WARM...MOIST AIR WILL DEVELOP RAIN ACRS THE REGION 
BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...CONTINUING INTO MONDAY EVENING AS THE SFC LOW 
AND COLD FRONT TRAVERSE THROUGH THE REGION.  HOWEVER...GIVEN THE 
UNCERTAINTY OF THE SFC LOW POSITION...WILL SHOW ONLY SMALL DIURNAL 
CHANGES IN THE LOWS MONDAY MORNING AND THE HIGHS MONDAY AFTN AS ANY 
DEVIATION OF THE SFC LOW TO A MORE WESTERN TRACK WILL CAUSE TEMPS TO 
BE MUCH WARMER.

SHOT OF RAIN SHOULD TRACK NW OF FCST AREA DIRECLY UNDER H5 S/W...AND

THEN QUICKLY DROP OFF. GUIDANCE IS ABOUT 10 DEGREES TOO LOW IF ETA 
SFC TEMPS ARE REALIZED...AND THEY LOOK TO BE A GOOD REPRESENTATION. 
WILL OPEN UP A RANGE IN TEMPERATURES TO ACCOUNT FOR DISCREPANCIES IN

DRYING MAY NOT OCCUR IN LOWEST LEVELS OF ATMOS TONIGHT. NUMERICAL 
GUIDANCE IS ALL OVER THE BOARD...BUT CURRENT FCST HAS THE TREND WELL 
IN HAND. ERN FCST AREA WOULD HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR HOLDING ON TO

BOMBING OUT THE SFC AND H5 LOW OVER THE WRN GTLKS RGN. SUNDAY COULD 
BE SNEAKY WARM EVEN WITH CLOUD COVER AND LIKELYHOOD OF SHOWERS. WILL 
NOT CHANGE MUCH BUT BUMP TEMPS ACROSS THE BOARD A LITTLE.

BE EARLY THIS MORNING...AND UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE QUICKLY GETS

BENEATH H8 DONT BUDGE THROUGH 60 HOURS. THOUGH A FEW BREAKS MAY BE 
EVIDENT OVER NRN PORTIONS OF CWA THIS EVENING...WILL GO WITH 
MOCLOUDY FCST VS THE PARTLY CLOUDY MENTIONED OVER THE NORTH.

FOR THE MID TERM...AVN AND CANADIEN MODEL BOTH IN AGREEMENT WITH 
LONGWAVE PATTERN THROUGH 12Z SUN. SFC FEATURES DIVERGE BY 0Z MON 
WHERE AVN WANTS TO SPIN UP STRONG LOW OVER THE GTLKS. WILL FAVOR THE

STRONGLY AMPLIFIED RIDGE OVER WESTERN PLAINS CUTTING OFF SYSTEM FROM 
NRN PACIFIC ORIGINS. CANADIEN MODEL ALSO BUILDS IN A RIDGE...BUT IS 
QUITE LESS AMPLIFIED AND NEVER CUTS OFF H5 LOW HERE. THIS ALSO KEEPS 
THE SFC FEATURES LESS DRASTIC. SINCE MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT...AND RAIN LIKELY NOTED ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WILL 
NOT EXPECT TO MAKE MANY CHANGES TO FCST IN EXTENDED.

PLACEMENT OF SFC LOW IS UNRESOLVED FOR ANY OF THE MODELS AND A 
CONSENSUS WOULD PUT IT IN CENTRAL KY 12Z FRI. MAIN CENTER OF THE LOW

AS FOR PRECIP IN THE SHORT TERM...WILL KEEP A DRIZZLE MENTION FOR

WARM FRONT AND JUST SKIM SE FCST AREA BY 12Z FRI. THINK THAT NRN 
PORTIONS OF FCST AREA SHOULD ONLY SEE SOME LIGHT RAIN AND SPRINKLES 
THROUGH THIS TIME. TIMING IN CURRENT FCST IS GOOD WITH LATE MENTION 
FOR MOST AREAS. POPS ON FRIDAY SHOULD BE TRICKIEST AS MODELS HAVE 
INDICATED BEST SHOT OF RAIN NW OF LOW TRACK UNDER WEAKENING H5 TROF. 
THIS DIFFERS FROM PREVIOUS RUNS WHERE WARM SECTOR AND SE FCST AREA 
HAD BEST SHOT OF RAIN. THOUGH AN ISOLATED STRIKE OR TWO IS EXPECTED 
DIRECTLY SE OF THE SFC LOW...WONT MENTION THUNDER IN ZONES AS UPPER 
SUPPORT IS DIMINISHING AND ACTUAL TRACK OF LOW IS STILL IN QUESTION.

TEMPERATURES ON FRIDAY WILL ALSO PROVIDE QUITE A CHALLENGE. 
NUMERICAL GUIDANCE SEEMS TOO LOW...AND THE STEADY NATURE OF TEMPS 
THAT DAY SHOULD ONLY BE NOTED IN FAR NW PART OF CWA. MESOETA TEMPS 
SHOULD BE CLOSER TO THE TRUTH FOR SW AND NE CWA...THOUGH THE WARM 
SECTOR LOOKS JUST TOO WARM ON THESE TEMPS AND MAY NOT EVEN GET THAT 
FAR NORTH. 

RIDGE BUILDS IN FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY AND HIGH IS PROGGED TO BE

WILL DEVELOP OVER THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY (AS 
PRESSURE CONDENSATION DEFICITS DROP BELOW 10 MB).  AS A 
RESULT...WILL BRING RAIN INTO THE SRN CWFA AROUND MIDNIGHT THURSDAY 
NIGHT...CONTINUING RAIN ACRS THE REGION ON FRIDAY.  SINCE I WENT 
WARMER WITH THURSDAY HIGHS AND WITH INCREASING CLOUDS THURSDAY

EVENING AS SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  SKIES

DPROG/DT AT 36 HOURS SHOWS LITTLE IF ANY CHANGE ON AVN MODEL...AND 
SLIGHT CHANGES ON ETA. HAVE NOTICED THAT THE AVN PICKED UP ON A WEAK 
WAVE OVER THE PAC NW WITH PREVIOUS 2 RUNS WHERE ETA IS JUST NOW 
CATCHING UP ON THIS. LIKE THE FACT THAT THE MODELLERS POINTED OUT 
THE AVN CONSISTENCY. A WEAK NRN AND DISTINCT SRN S/W SPLITS THE SFC 
LOWS AND OTHER MODELS ARE STARTING TO REALIZE THAT THE S/W ISNT 
GOING TO RUN N-S FROM CANADA TO TX. THIS WOULD ALSO ENHANCE THE 
TRENDS FROM THE AVN. 

AS SFC LOW GETS PULLED NE AWAY FROM REMNANTS OF FRONT EXTENDING FROM 
OH VLY TO LOWER MS VLY...NEXT WAVE GETS SPUN UP OVER THE GULF STATES 
DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. NGM AND ETA ARE NOTABLY SLOWER WITH THIS 
FEATURE THAN THE AVN...THOUGH THE TRACK OF THE STRENGTHENING LOW 
REMAINS SIMILAR THROUGH ALL MODELS. THOUGH THE ETA COMES IN MUCH 
FURTHER SW WITH SFC LOW OVER THE GULF STATES...ITS RH AND QPF FIELDS 
MIMIC THE NGM AND AVN. THOUGH IT WONT AFFECT MUCH IN THE TIMING OF 
PRECIP OVER SERN CWA OVERNIGHT THURS...WILL STILL LEAN TOWARDS THE 
AVN.

AM HESITANT TO KEEP MENTION OF SHOWERS OVER ERN FA TODAY. WILL DROP 
DOWN TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SPRINKLES AND HAVE LATE WORDING HERE. WRN 
FCST AREA SHOULD SEE A BATCH OR TWO OF LIGHT RAIN FROM SOUTH TO 
NORTH AS IT BECOMES MORE WIDESPREAD BY THE EVENING. WILL STICK WITH 
PREVIOUS FORECAST AND RANGE FROM 40 POPS WEST AND SOUTHWEST AND 30 
WAPAKONETA AREA. TIMING IN CURRENT FCST IS GOOD TOO. STRONG THETA E 
ADVECTION GOING ON OVERNIGHT WED INTO THURS...BUT ELEVATED LIS 
DONT REALLY GO NEGATIVE UNTIL 12 AND 18Z THURS. WILL BREAK OUT FAR 
SOUTHWEST PORTION OF FCST AREA AND THROW THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
THUNDERSTORM HERE TOWARDS MORNING. WILL KEEP IT OUT OF CINCY METRO 
AREA HOWEVER. 

DRY PUNCH SHOULD ALLOW FOR A BREAK ON THURSDAY AS NEXT SYSTEM PUSHES

CHANCE OF SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT. CURRENT FCST DOESNT HAVE PRECIP

A MENTION OF A LINGERING SPRINKLE POSSIBLE...MAINLY OVER THE

THIS CONVERGENT AREA IS TOO STRONG FOR THE WIND FIELDS AT THIS

QUITE REASONABLE AS CLOUD COVER WILL DEFINITELY BE ON THE THICK

UPPER AIR PATTERN SHOWS ZONAL FLOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.  THAT IS

TROF THAT WILL DIG INTO THE GREAT PLAINS BY EARLY SATURDAY.  TROF 
AXIS IS PROGGED TO CROSS OUR FCST AREA BY LATE SUNDAY...WITH A 
COUPLE OF ASSOCIATED SHORT WAVES BRINGING SIGNIFICANT WEATHER TO OUR 
REGION.

SFC MAP HAS RIDGE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY EXTENDING SOUTH FROM CENTRAL 
CANADA.  DEVELOPING LOW OVER OKLAHOMA HAS WARM FRONT STRETCHING INTO 
TENNESSEE.  LOW IS FCST TO MOVE NORTHEAST INTO KENTUCKY BY SATURDAY 
MORNING AND GIVE OUR AREA A DOSE OF RAIN IN THE PROCESS.  LATEST 
MODEL RUN HAS SYSTEM FASTER...SO ILL NEED TO ADD CHANCE POPS LATE 
TONIGHT IN THE DAY AND CVG GROUPS.  OTHERWISE PREVIOUS FCST LOOKS 
GOOD FOR SATURDAY WITH CATEGORICAL POPS SOUTH GRADING TO LIKELY AT 
DAY AND CMH AND CHANCE POPS FAR NORTH. 

CHANCE SHRA CHANGING TO SHSN STILL APPEARS APPROPRIATE FOR EARLY 
SATURDAY NIGHT IN THE SFC LOWS BACKLASH.  FASTER SOLUTION SUGGESTS 
PARTIAL CLEARING WEST LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
WILL REMAIN BEHIND THE SYSTEM TO WARRANT PARTLY SUNNY FCST ON SUNDAY.

TEMPS:  FWC LOOKS TOO HIGH TONIGHT AT CVG WITH 46...AND TOO LOW AT

400 AM EST WED DEC 5 2001

A VERY WARM DAY IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY.

HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT OVER THE EASTERN UNITED 
STATES WILL BRING RECORD WARMTH TO THE REGION.  A WEAK S/WV IN THE 
SWLY FLOW ALOFT ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL BRING MID AND HIGH 
CLOUDS TO THE AREA (15K TO 25K).  USING ETA FORECAST SOUNDING AND 
ACCOUNTING FOR THESE CLOUDS...TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL MAKE OR 
EXCEED RECORD TEMPERATURES.  THE ONLY THING THAT WOULD STOP THE 
RECORDS FROM BEING BROKEN IS IF THE CLOUDS BECOME TOO THICK.  I AM 
BANKING ON SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER...SO NEAR RECORD OR RECORD 
WORDING WILL BE USED IN THE ZONES TODAY.


ETA/AVN MODELS ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR WITH THE SENSIBLE WEATHER ELEMENTS 
THROUGH THE NEXT 36 HOURS...THEN THEY DIVERGE SOMEWHAT.   TWO 
S/WVS...ONE MOVING INTO THE SRN PLAINS AND THE OTHER INTO THE NRN 
PLAINS...WILL TEAM UP...BRINGING A COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION LATE 
TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY.  PCPN EFFICIENCIES ARE HIGH ENOUGH...COMBINED 
WITH LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND UPR LVL DIVERGE...TO PRODUCE SHOWERS 
ALONG AND BEHIND THE FRONT.  SHOWERS WILL APCH THE FAR NORTHWEST 
AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND THEN THEY WILL MAKE IT INTO THE SE CWFA DURING 
THE DAY THURSDAY.  OVERNIGHT LOWS TONIGHT IN THE LOWER AND MID 50S 
SHOULD BUDGE LITTLE ON THURSDAY.  SKIES WILL CLEAR GRADUALLY FROM NW 
TO SE ON THURSDAY.

THE ETA MODELS TENDS TO HANG THE COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY JUST SOUTH 
OF THE OHIO RIVER THURSDAY NIGHT WHILE THE AVN PUSHES THE FRONT A 
LITTLE FARTHER ALONG.  EITHER WAY...BELIEVE PCPN AND CLOUDS SHOULD 
GET FAR ENOUGH SOUTH OF THE REGION SO THAT A MOSTLY CLEAR FCST WILL 
BE EXPERIENCED BY ALL.

A DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE PLAIN STATES ON FRIDAY IS FCST TO MOVE 
INTO THE EASTERN UNITED STATES FOR THE WEEKEND.  THIS WILL BRING 
MUCH COLDER AIR TO THE REGION AND EVEN A CHANCE FOR SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS.

.ILN...NONE.

KILN RADAR HAS CHANGED TO PCPN MODE.  MIE OBSERVATION REPORTED 0.01 
MEASURABLE RAINFALL.  BASED ON THIS DATA...WILL CHANGE SPRINKLE 
FORECAST TO A 30 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS.

...PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING SHOWS EXTENSIVE CLOUDINESS ACRS THE 
CWFA.  THIS WAS IN RESPONSE TO ISENTROPIC LIFT (WAA).  A COUPLE OF 
WEAK S/WVS ARE FCST TO MOVE ACRS THE REGION TODAY IN COMBINATION 
WITH THE WAA.  MOSAIC RADAR NOW BEGINNING TO SHOW SOME LIGHT RETURNS 
ACRS IL...IN...AND PARTS OF NRN KY.  DEEPER MSTR REMAINS OVER THE 
FAR WRN CWFA WITH DRIER LOW LEVELS EAST.  AT THIS POINT...WILL 
INTRODUCE SPRINKLES TO THE FCST AREA..AND WILL LET THE DAY SHIFT 
DETERMINE THE STRENGTH OF DEVELOPING ECHOES.  RIGHT NOW...IF 
MEASURABLE RAIN SHOULD OCCUR...IT WOULD FAVOR THE WRN CWFA.  TEMPS 
TODAY WILL BE CLOUD DEPENDENT.  MOS LOOKS VERY REASONABLE IN 
COMPARISON TO FCST SOUNDINGS...SO WILL GO WITH MOS TODAY..

FOR TONIGHT...PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ARE EXPECTED.  WITH A S/WV PUSHING 
INTO THE PLAINS FROM THE DESERT SW...MID AND HIGH LVL MSTR WILL 
PRODUCE CLOUDS THAT WILL ADVECT TOWARD THE REGION LATE TONIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY MORNING.  MEAN H5 LVL RIDGING WILL TAKE PLACE AHEAD OF THE 
S/WV...ALLOWING FOR HIGHER HEIGHTS AND INCREASING WAA.  TEMPS FOR 
WEDNESDAY WILL BE BALMY WITH HIGHS MEETING OR EXCEEDING RECORD 
VALUES.  MAX TEMPS AGAIN WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE MID TO HIGH LVL 
CLOUDINESS.  THERE IS A HINT THAT SOME OF MID AND HIGH LVL 
CLOUDINESS MAY PIVOT NORTH OF THE SRN CWFA.  GIVEN FCST SOUNDINGS 
AND ACCOUNTING FOR CLOUDS...WILL STICK CLOSE TO OR GO SLIGHTLY 
HIGHER THAN MOS VALUES.

MODELS ARE STILL CONSISTENT IN BRINGING A COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION 
BY THURSDAY MORNING.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE IN THE MODELS HAVE BEEN TO 
THE INTENSITY OF A SFC LOW PUSHING NORTHEAST INTO CANADA.  THIS IS 
BECAUSE THE MODELS HAVE SHOWN A TREND TOWARD A STRONGER S/WV MOVING 
IN FROM THE PAC NW INTO THE NRN PLAINS.  REGARDLESS...THIS SHOULD 
HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE ANTICIPATED WX FOR OUR REGION.  WILL BRING 
LIKELY SHOWERS INTO THE NW WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH CHC POPS FOR CMH AND 
CVG.  COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION DURING THURSDAY MORNING.  
SHOWERS WILL BE LIKELY ACRS THE ENTIRE CWFA DURING THE 
MORNING...WITH DRYING CONDITIONS OCCURRING FROM NW TO SE THROUGH THE

BASED ON LATEST AVN RUN.

IN THE CLDS IN THE SE PART OF CWFA WHERE THEY ARE GETTING

SEE TEMPS RISE OVERNIGHT. 

THE BAND OF STRATIFORM RAIN CURRENTLY NEAR THE OH RIVER WILL 
CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTH WITH THE WARM FRONT WHILE THE AREA OF HEAVIER 
RAIN IS MOVING INTO WRN KY. BASED ON CURRENT RADAR TRENDS AND MDL

SYSTEM AS IT MOVES NORTH ON THURSDAY.  AVN BRINGS MORE ENERGY AND 
PRECIP MORE QUICKLY INTO OUR AREA WHILE THE ETA KEEPS MOST OF THE 
ACTION FARTHER SOUTH WITH THE MAIN VORT CENTER.  OVERALL...THE AVN 
SOLUTION POINTS TO A WIDESPREAD HEAVY RAIN EVENT...WITH THE ETA 
SHOWING A MODERATE AMOUNT OF RAIN MAINLY OVER THE NORTHERN PART OF 
OUR CWA.

AT ANY RATE...ILL GO WITH HIGH POPS THROUGH THE FCST PERIOD AS PER 
CURRENT GUIDANCE.  DUE TO MODEL UNCERTAINTY I WONT TRY TO SPLIT 
HAIRS BY VARYING COVERAGE AND TIMING.  I WILL KEEP CHANCE TSRA AS 
ISENTROPIC LIFT/MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL BE STRONG.  

TEMP FCST IS TRICKY WITH TIMING OF SYSTEM CAUSING NON-DIURNAL 
TRENDS...E.G. WARM ADVECTION OCCURRING TONIGHT AND COLD ADVECTION 
DURING THE DAYTIME ON THURSDAY.  HAVING SAID THAT...FWC TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK TOO LOW SO ILL TREND WARMER TOWARD THE MAV AND MEX.

.ILN...NONE.

IT LOOKS LIKE A RELATIVELY DRY NOVEMBER WILL END ON A VERY WET NOTE 
THIS WEEK.

MESOETA MODEL HAS TRENDED TOWARD THE AVN MODEL IN TERMS OF THE SHORT 
TERM WEATHER FEATURES.  A VIGOROUS S/WV ACRS THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL 
PIVOT NE INTO THE UPR MS RIVER VLY ON TUESDAY.  ITS ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE CWFA BY TUESDAY AFTN.  BEFORE THE COLD 
FRONT...A DEVELOPING WARM FRONT ACRS THE SRN GULF CST STATES WILL 
MOVE NE TOWARD THE CWFA TONIGHT AND THROUGH THE REGION TUESDAY 
MORNING.  IT IS THIS FRONT AND ASSOCIATED LOW LVL DYNAMICS THAT WILL 
BRING WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TO THE REGION 
OVERNIGHT.  ACTIVITY WILL BEGIN IN THE SW CWFA FIRST AROUND 
MIDNIGHT...THEN PROGRESS NE THROUGH THE REMAINDER CWFA BY SUNRISE 
TUESDAY MORNING.  THE CONVECTION WILL BE OF AN ELEVATED NATURE.  
MESOETA 4 AM FCST SOUNDING FOR CVG YIELDS ABOUT 550 J/KG OF ELEVATED 
CAPE.  THIS ELEVATED CAPE WILL BE PRODUCED BY STRONG...WARM...MOIST 
ASCENT INTO THE OHIO VLY.  THE LOW LEVEL INVERSION IS SHALL...BUT 
STRONG.  THUS...WOULD TEND TO THINK THAT IF SEVERE WEATHER 
DEVELOPS...HAIL WOULD BE THE PRIMARY THREAT (AND IT SHOULD BE 
MARGINAL IN SIZE AT BEST).  HOWEVER...THE WINDS ALOFT WILL BE VERY 
STRONG (50 KT BETWEEN 3K AND 4K ABOVE THE SFC).  IF CONVECTION CAN 
DEVELOP IN A LINEAR NATURE...THERE WOULD BE THE POTENTIAL TO PUSH 
SOME OF THIS WIND ENERGY TO THE SFC DESPITE THE LOW LVL INVERSION.  
IN ADDITION...STORM RELATIVE HELICITIES EXCEED 400 MS/S2.  AM 
CONCERNED THAT A FEW STORMS MAY CONTAIN ROTATING UPDRAFTS...AND 
WOULD BE DANGEROUS IF LOCATED NEAR THE SFC WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  
WILL ISSUE AN SPS BASED ON THIS.

ON TUESDAY...COLD FRONT IS FCST TO BE ALONG THE IN/OH BORDER BY 18Z 
AND EAST OF A CLE...CMH...PMH LINE BY 00Z WEDNESDAY.  SHOWERS...AND 
POSSIBLY SFC BASED THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE DAY.

ON TUESDAY NIGHT...THE FRONT STALLS JUST SOUTH OF THE REGION.  
ANOTHER VIGOROUS S/WV PIVOTING OUT OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WILL 
BEGIN DEVELOPING ANOTHER SFC LOW OVER THE LOWER MS VLY.  THIS S/WV 
WILL BRING ANOTHER SURGE OF MOIST AIR FROM THE GULF COAST 
STATES...KEEPING THE REGION ON THE RAINY SIDE WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY EVENING.  THE HEAVIEST RAIN WILL LIKELY FALL ACRS THE 
CWFA...BUT ITS AXIS WILL DEPEND ON HOW THE LOW LEVEL JET DEVELOPS 
ACRS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY.

WILL BASE FCST TEMPS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM ON A BLEND OF SFC ETA 
SKIN TEMPS AND MOS GUIDANCE.

FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE STREAMS AHEAD OF NEXT LOW DEVELOPING 
SOMEWHERE OVER PLAINS STATES. THOUGH ISENTROPIC LIFT COULD SPARK 
SOME LIGHT SHOWERS LATE ON FRIDAY...MAIN THINKING HERE IS THAT THERE 
WONT BE A TRIGGER AND SPRINKLES WOULD BE THE WORST-CASE SCENARIO. 
CURRENT FCST HAS A CHANCE IN THE SOUTHWEST WITH AFTERNOON WORDING 
AND WILL BUMP DOWN TO A 20 POP.

SHOWERS ON SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT MAY HAVE SOME THUNDER THROWN 
IN THERE ALONG THE FRONT...BUT WILL KEEP MENTION OUT ATTM AS TIMING 
PUTS FROPA AT AN UNFAVORABLE OVERNIGHT PASSAGE. ALSO...BREEZY ON SAT 
WITH 15-20 MPH WINDS.

WILL NOT STRAY TOO MUCH ON GUIDANCE TEMPS...AND FAVOR THE WARMER 
FWC/MAV NUMBERS IN THE 50S FOR TOMORROWS LOWS. PROBLEMS ARISE 
SATURDAY AS STRONG WAA KICKS IN...THOUGH CLOUDY SKIES AND CHANCE OF 
RAIN IN THE WEST COULD POSE A BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH COOLER HIGHS. 
WILL STAY CLOSE TO FWC NUMBERS HERE.

HAVE DONE SOME SWITCHING AROUND ON THE EXTENDED WITH PULLING OUT 
SHOWERS ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY...ADDING THE CHANCE ON WEDNESDAY IN 
THE WEST AND FOR THE REST OF THE FCST AREA ON THURSDAY. LOOKS LIKE 
THE NEXT SYSTEM IN THE PLAINS WILL ALSO BRING WAA OVER FCST AREA AT

THE RAIN IF THIS PATTERN IS REALIZED. AM KEYING ON THE ECMWF AND 
UKMET VS THE MRF AT THIS TIME. SFC RIDGE OVER ERN THIRD OF U.S. 
SHOULD BREAK DOWN AND ALLOW DIGGING SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS TO SPIN 
UP. MRF HAS SFC LOW A BIT FAR TO THE WEST AND KEEPS THE RIDGE OVER

PUTS FROPA AT AN UNFAVORABLE OVERNIGHT PASSAGE. ALSO...BREEZY ON SAT 
WITH 15-20 MPH WINDS.

WILL NOT STRAY TOO MUCH ON GUIDANCE TEMPS...AND FAVOR THE WARMER 
FWC/MAV NUMBERS IN THE 50S FOR TOMORROWS LOWS. PROBLEMS ARISE 
SATURDAY AS STRONG WAA KICKS IN...THOUGH CLOUDY SKIES AND CHANCE OF 
RAIN IN THE WEST COULD POSE A BIT OF A PROBLEM WITH COOLER HIGHS. 
WILL STAY CLOSE TO FWC NUMBERS HERE.

HAVE DONE SOME SWITCHING AROUND ON THE EXTENDED WITH PULLING OUT 
SHOWERS ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY...ADDING THE CHANCE ON WEDNESDAY IN 
THE WEST AND FOR THE REST OF THE FCST AREA ON THURSDAY. LOOKS LIKE 
THE NEXT SYSTEM IN THE PLAINS WILL ALSO BRING WAA OVER FCST AREA AT 
THIS TIME...BUT IT SHOULD STILL BE ON THE TOUGH SIDE TO WRING OUT 
THE RAIN IF THIS PATTERN IS REALIZED. AM KEYING ON THE ECMWF AND 
UKMET VS THE MRF AT THIS TIME. SFC RIDGE OVER ERN THIRD OF U.S. 
SHOULD BREAK DOWN AND ALLOW DIGGING SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS TO SPIN 
UP. MRF HAS SFC LOW A BIT FAR TO THE WEST AND KEEPS THE RIDGE OVER 
THE ERN U.S. EVEN THOUGH IT INDICATES NEAR ZONAL H5 FLOW. WILL BE 
ABOVE NORMALS ON TEMPS FOR THE LATTER PART OF FCST PERIOD.

MID/HI WAA CLOUDS TRYING TO DISSIPATE LEAVING MOCLR SKIES OVER THE

UPPER AIR PATTERN HAS H5 TROF EXITING THROUGH NEW ENGLAND AS RIDGE 
GRADUALLY BECOMES REESTABLISHED OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS.  RIDGE AXIS 
IS PROGGED TO CROSS OHIO ON THANKSGIVING BEFORE OUR AREA COMES UNDER 
THE INFLUENCE OF ANOTHER TROF BEGINNING FRIDAY.

SFC MAP SHOWS BROAD HIGH PRESSURE MOVING UP THE OHIO VALLEY.  HIGH 
IS FCST TO DROP SOUTHEAST OVER THE NEXT DAY BENEATH THE UPPER TROF 
BEFORE IT MERGES ON THANKSGIVING WITH A CANADIAN HIGH ALONG THE EAST 
COAST.  PERSISTENT HIGH WILL KEEP PRECIP OUT OF OUR AREA THROUGH 
THANKSGIVING...SO SKY CONDITIONS AND TEMPS WILL BE THE FOCUS OF THE 
48 HOUR FCST.  

SATELLITE SHOWS LOTS OF CU ACROSS OUR CWA IN RESIDUAL MOISTURE ON 
THE EAST SIDE OF THE HIGH.  CU WILL DISSIPATE AS THE SUN 
SETS...HOWEVER...HIGH CLOUDS WILL ENTER THE PICTURE BY LATE EVENING 
AS THEY WORK DOWN HERE FROM WISCONSIN.  THUS...PARTLY CLOUDY WILL 
WORK FOR TONIGHT.  HIGH CLOUDS WILL LIKELY STAY AROUND FOR A GOOD 
PART OF WEDNESDAY...WHILE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL EXIT AS 850 MB 
FLOW TURNS WEST...SO CU WILL PROBABLY NOT BE HERE ON WEDNESDAY. 
THEREFORE...ILL STAY WITH PARTLY SUNNY FOR WEDNESDAY.  WITH LITTLE 
MOISTURE SHOWING UP ON MODEL PROGS...ILL KEEP MOSTLY CLEAR FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  ON THANKSGIVING WELL EXPERIENCE A RETURN OF HIGH 
CLOUDS...SO PARTLY SUNNY WILL BE APPROPRIATE.  

NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE FRIDAY...WHEN ISENTROPIC LIFT KICKS IN 
AHEAD OF THE NEXT H5 TROF.  CONDITIONS COULD REMAIN MOIST THROUGH 
MUCH OF THE EXTENDED FCST AS A PERSISTENT SOUTHWEST UPPER FLOW TAKES 
HOLD.

STRONGER RETURNS TO THE NORTH OF THE CWFA ARE EXPECTED TO STAY NE OF 
THE CWFA OVERNIGHT.  THIS IS SUPPORTED BY 300 K ISENTROPIC LIFT.  
LOWER CONDENSATION PRESSURE DEFICITS (50 MB AND LESS) STAY FOCUSED

PREVIOUS RUNS. MEAN H5 WEAK RIDG OVER OH VLY BREAKS APART AND GETS 
CAUGHT IN ZONAL FLOW...ALLOWING FOR A WEAK S/W TO SPIN OVER NRN GT

ITS THE ONLY FEATURE IN THE SHORT TERM THAT SEEMS WORTH MENTIONING. 
SOME MID TO HI LVL CLOUDS MAY BE FOUND OVER NRN CWA FROM THIS ON

SHUNT MOISTURE FROM ANY S/WS CAUGHT IN ZONAL FLOW TO THE NORTH. 
ILNS SRN FCST AREA IS CAUGHT IN THIS AXIS AND THE ACUTAL SFC HI 
SEEMS TO RETROGRADE TO THE W OVER MS VLY.

MRF SEEMS TO HAVE A LOGICAL PROGRESSION TO THE H5 LOW SPINNING OVER

IT MAKES IT JUST W OF FCST AREA...CUTOFF IS BARELY A WEAK TROF BUT

EXTEND THIS THROUGH TUESDAY. 

144 HOUR ON CANADIAN MODEL IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE MRF WITH MEAN

SFC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING FROM THE LOWER MS RIVER VLY 
INTO THE OHIO VLY WILL SAG SOUTHWARD OVERNIGHT AS A COLD FRONT...NOW 
NEAR NRN PLAINS/CANADIAN BORDER...SWEEPS SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION.

ONLY A FEW HIGH CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT...SO MOSTLY CLEAR SKY 
WORDING WILL BE USED.  TEMPS WILL BE A LITTLE TRICKY AS A SOUTHWEST 
GRADIENT TIGHTENS.  WARMEST LOWS SHOULD BE ACROSS THE NORTHWEST CWFA 
WITH THE COOLEST READINGS IN THE SOUTHEAST.  

ON SATURDAY...MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST...DESPITE THE 
APPROACH OF THE COLD FRONT TO THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES BY 18Z (1 
PM).  MOST OF THE DEEP MSTR ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT SHOULD REMAIN 
TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE CWFA.  FCST MODEL SOUNDINGS CONFIRM 
THAT DESPITE VERY WARM AIR ALOFT...THE INVERSION IS TOO DEEP AND TOO 
STRONG TO MIX EFFECTIVELY.  THUS...MIXING UP TO AROUND 925 MB GIVES 
HIGHS IN THE MID 50S NORTH TO THE LOWER 60S SOUTH.  BREEZY

GRADIENT AND A LITTLE MIXING INTO THE 925 MB LEVEL.

AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT SHOULD BE NEAR THE OHIO RIVER BY 00Z 
SUNDAY (7 PM SATURDAY EVENING) AND THEN SOUTH OF THE REGION BY 03Z 
SUNDAY.  CAA BEHIND THE FRONT WILL DROP HIGH TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY 
5 TO 10 DEGREES.

SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE OVER THE CWFA SUNDAY NIGHT...PROVIDING 
FOR COLD LOWS.  A SLOW WARM UP IS EXPECTED EARLY INTO NEXT WEEK AS 
THE FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY ONCE AGAIN.  THE NEXT CHANCE FOR PCPN

NICE WX PATTERN STILL IN STORE FOR ILNS CWA. ASIDE FROM A SHOT OF 
RAIN ON THURS...POSSIBLY DURING THE EVENING IN SOUTHEAST...CLEAR 
SKIES AND HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE. SUITE OF 
MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MAIN FEATURES...AND LITTLE 
CHANGES EXPECTED FROM PREVIOUS FORECASTS.

AM STILL SEEING A WEAK SECONDARY FRONT/TROF LATE ON SATURDAY AND 
OVERNIGHT. THIS SHOULD ONLY BRING AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER TO NRN 
FCST AREA AS ATMOSPHERE IS QUITE DRY UNDER THE MEAN RIDGING PATTERN. 
THIS TROF IS IN RELATION TO A S/W NORTH OF THE GTLKS. SFC CENTER OF 
LOW PRESSURE ALSO DEVELOPS HERE...BUT LOOKS TO BE TOO FAR N OF FCST 
AREA TO REALLY BE A PLAYER. WILL INCREASE CLOUD COVER BUT NOT MUCH 
ELSE FOR THIS FEATURE. 

MRF HINTING AT A RETURN TO ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
WM FNT APPROACHES SWRN FCST AREA 12Z MONDAY AND LIFTS TO THE NORTH 
LATER THAT NIGHT. THOUGH CANADIAN MODEL ONLY GOES OUT TO 0Z 
MON...PICTURED WITH THE MRF AT THIS TIME...THIS CHANCE OF RAIN LOOKS 
REASONABLE AND WILL PUT IN 30 POPS FOR THE DAY AND NIGHT. STRENGTH 
OF THE HIGH TO THE EAST AND THE LOW IN THE PLAINS SHOULD ALLOW THIS 
CHANCE OF RAIN TO ZIP NORTH AND BE OUT OF THE PICTURE ON TUESDAY. 
MRF HOLDS BACK AND KEEPS A CHANCE OF RAIN FOR TUESDAY...BUT ILL ERR 
ON THE SIDE OF OPTIMISM AND EXPECT THE FLOW TO PUSH IT NORTH. 

GUIDANCE TEMPS OUTSIDE OF THURSDAY LOOK REASONABLE. TIMING OF THE 
FRONT WILL BE THE BIGGEST CHANCE FOR ERROR ON TEMPS. FWC PUSHES 
READINGS TO THE UPPER 60S ACROSS ENTIRE FCST AREA THOUGH AVN IS 
STILL LOOKING AROUND 60. AGREE THAT THICKNESSES WILL DEFINITELY 
SUPPORT THE WARMER TEMPS...BUT CI SHIELD AHEAD OF FRONT SHOULD 
HAMPER HIGHS THIS DAY. WILL PLAY THE MIDDLE ROAD HERE AND RANGE FROM 
LOW 60S NORTHWEST TO AROUND 70 IN THE SOUTHEAST. OTHERWISE WILL STAY 
NEAR GUIDANCE THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT (50S AND 30S) AND THEN WARM FOR

BUT AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER. UKMET AND MRF SHOWING THIS FEATURE 
AND CANADIAN MODEL IS A BIT WEAKER.

SAG SLOWLY INTO THE SRN CWFA THIS MORNING...BECOMING HARD TO DISCERN 
AT THE SFC BY THE AFTN HOURS AS THE FLOW BECOMES EASTERLY.  CURRENT 
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS HIGH SC/LOW AC CLOUD DECK ACRS THE DAY...CVG 
AND CMH LOCATIONS.  THIS SEEMS TO BE IN RESPONSE TO MSTR NEAR 775 
MB.  ISENTROPIC LIFT NEAR THIS PRESSURE LEVEL (300 K) INDICATES THAT 
WEAK LIFT WILL CONTINUE DURING THE MORNING HOURS...AND PERHAPS 
WEAKEN EVEN FURTHER BY THE AFTN HOURS.  IT IS DIFFICULT ATTM TO KNOW 
IF THE WEAKER LIFT BY AFTERNOON COMBINED WITH SOME HEATING OF THE 
SUN (TO LOWER THE RH VALUES WITHIN THE CLOUD DECK) WILL BE ENOUGH TO 
DISSIPATE THE CLOUDS.  WILL GO OPTIMISTIC AND BELIEVE THIS WILL BE 
THE CASE BY THE AFTN HOURS.  WITH WEAK CAA ACRS THE NORTH...TEMPS 
WILL BE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN YESTERDAY/S READINGS.  MOS TEMPS LOOK 
GOOD.

FOR TONIGHT...THE AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT ACRS INDIANA AND 
ILLINOIS WILL MOVE NE AS A WARM FRONT INTO THE SRN GREAT LAKES.  
BOTH THE ETA AND AVN MODEL SEEM TO SHOW SOME CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK TO 
THE VORTICITY MAX ACRS MICHIGAN TONIGHT.  A MESO SCALE COMPLEX IS 
FORECAST TO FORM ACRS SRN WISCONSIN...MOVING INTO SRN MICHIGAN.  850 
MB TO 300 MB THICKNESS PATTERN WOULD SUGGEST THAT SOME PCPN MAY 
DRIBBLE INTO THE FAR NRN CWFA OVERNIGHT.  WILL KEEP A SILENT 20 
POP ACRS THE NORTH ATTM.  SKIES WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT AS 
MAINLY MID TO HIGH LVL CLOUDS MOVES ACRS THE REGION.

ON WEDNESDAY...WARM FRONT WILL LIFT NE AWAY FROM THE REGION.  RH 
PROGS AT HIGH LVLS SUGGEST SOME CIRRUS.  WILL KEEP THE OPTIMISTIC 
MOSTLY SUNNY FCST.  TEMPS WILL WARM NICELY INTO THE MID 60S TO 
AROUND 70.

NEXT CHC FOR PRECIPITATION MAY NOT HAPPEN UNTIL FRIDAY AS A 
WEAKENING COLD FRONT TRIES TO PUSH THROUGH THE REGION.

WITH UPPER LOW DROPPING INTO NORTH DAKOTA...OHIO VALLEY IS IN VERY 
MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THIS MORNING.  WITH AVN SHOWING MORE 
CONSISTENCY...MODELS PROGS HAVE UPPER LOW MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES TO NEW ENGLAND BY FRIDAY.

SHORT WAVE MOVING INTO INDIANA IS TOUCHING OFF WIDESPREAD TSRA.  
TSRA ARE WORKING THROUGH OUR CWA AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO DO SO INTO 
MID MORNING.  DRY SLOT EVIDENT ON SATELLITE BEHIND SHORT WAVE SHOULD 
BE HERE BY LATE MORNING BRINGING DESTABILIZING BREAKS IN THE 
CLOUDS.  AFTER DRY SLOT STRONG COLD FRONT WILL ARRIVE IN OUR WESTERN 
COUNTIES ACCOMPANIED BY POWERFUL AND WELL ORGANIZED OMEGA...WIND 
FIELDS/HELICITY...PVA...AND MOISTURE CONVERGENCE.  THUS...WE ARE 
OUTLOOKED IN HIGH RISK FOR SVR (SEE SWODY1). 

WITH PRECIP ALREADY OCCURRING AND PERSISTING ILL GO ABOVE FWC POPS 
TODAY INTO NEAR 100% RANGE.  PRECIP WITH FRONT WILL CONTINUE INTO 
TONIGHT PERIOD SO CAT POPS AGAIN WILL BE APPROPRIATE.  ILL GO WITH 
SEVERE WORDING TODAY AND TONIGHT.    

LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEHIND FRONT TONIGHT AND THURSDAY WILL WARRANT 
MOSTLY CLOUDY FORECAST.

RATHER LOW SOIL MOISTURE PRIOR TO CURRENT RAINFALL HAS PREVENTED 
FLOODING PROBLEMS...UNTIL NOW.  SOUTHEAST INDIANA HAS BEEN HARDEST 
HIT WITH 6-8 RADAR ESTIMATE IN RIPLEY COUNTY (FFW ISSUED).  

FWC TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE FOR TODAY.  TONIGHTS FWC LOWS AND 
THURSDAYS HIGHS LOOK TOO HIGH BEHIND THE FRONT SO ILL UNDERCUT FWC 
FOR THEN.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES STRONG POSITIVELY TILTED COLD FRONT OVER 
EASTERN IL WITH WARM FRONT ENTERING THE TRI-STATE.  SATELLITE 
IMAGERY INDICATES PLENTY BREAKS IN THE WARM SECTOR WITH TDS INTO THE 
UPPER 60S.

COMPLICATED FORECAST SO WILL JUST HIT THE HIGHLIGHTS AND HAVE ZONES 
READY EARLY.  POSITIVELY TILTED COLD FRONT WILL BECOME NEGATIVELY 
TILTED THIS EVENING AND BLAST ACROSS THE FA.  CAPE VALUES ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE 1000 TO 2000 J/KG WITH HELICITIES IN EXCESS OF 300 
M2/S2.  AS A RESULT BULK RICHARDSON  IS VERY FAVORABLE IN THE 
TEENS.  WILL HIT EVENING THROUGH MIDNIGHT HARD WITH SEVERE WORDING 
EXPECT SPC TO ISSUE A BOX OVER WESTERN OHIO LATTER THIS AFTERNOON 
WITH DEVELOPMENT IN THE WARM SECTOR AND PASSAGE OF COLD FRONT.  
SKIES WILL CLEAR RAPIDLY FROM WEST TO EAST OVER FA.  WINDS WILL BE 
20 TO 30 MPH WITH SOME 40 MPH GUSTS THURSDAY.  THERE IS POTENTIAL 
FOR THEM TO BE STRONGER WHICH COULD PUSH INTO WIND ADVISORY BUT WILL 
LET LATTER SHIFTS DEAL WITH IT.  WILL KEEP MENTION OF RAIN AND SNOW 
ACROSS THE NORTH ON FRIDAY THRU SATURDAY BUT WILL DRY OUT THE SOUTH 
EXCEPT FRIDAY NIGHT.

FWC LOOKS RESPECTABLE FOR THE FIRST 3 PERIODS BUT WENT SIGNIFICANTLY

VERY CHANGEABLE WEATHER WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE REGION.

MESOETA AND AVN IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH S/WV TIMING AND FRONTAL 
PASSAGE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM FORECAST.

TO START...A WEAK S/WV WAS NOTED OVER SRN IL/IN THIS AFTN.  VERY 
WARM...MOIST FLOW IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS FEATURE WILL BRING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE CWFA THIS EVENING.  RADAR AND 
SATELLITE TRENDS CONFIRM THIS AS ACTIVITY WAS INCREASING IN COVERAGE.
BEHIND THIS FIRST S/WV IS ANOTHER S/WV...NOW LOCATED OVER OK/NRN TX.
THIS WILL ARRIVE TOWARD MORNING INTO THE MID OHIO VLY.  AS IT 
DOES...LOW LVL CONVERGENCE AT 925 MB AND 850 MB WILL TEAM UP WITH 
THIS S/WV TO CONTINUE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE REMAINDER OF 
THE NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.  CONSEQUENTLY...WILL HAVE CHANCE 
POPS FAR NORTH (40?)...LIKELY POPS DAYTON AND COLUMBUS (70?) AND 
CATEGORICAL POPS SOUTH (80?) CVG AND PMH FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.

THE BIG STORY FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING WILL BE A VIGOROUS 
COLD FRONT/UPR LVL LOW CURRENTLY ACRS THE PAC NW/INTERMOUNTAIN 
REGION...WHICH WILL DIG SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES.  THERE 
SEEMS TO BE A SMALL WINDOW DURING THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS WHERE 
PCPN WILL BE ON THE LOW SIDE IN TERMS OF COVERAGE.  WITH VERY STRONG 
WINDS ABOVE THE SFC (50 TO 60 KT AT 925 MB BY LATE WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON) ...CAPES FROM 1000 TO 1500 AND MASSIVE DYNAMIC 
LIFT...SEVERE WEATHER IS POSSIBLE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT IN THE 
FORM OF A SQUALL LINE.  ISOLATED TORNADOES ARE ALSO NOT OUT OF THE 
QUESTION (STORM RELATIVE HELICITIES ABOVE 300 M2/S2).  IT WILL BE 
WINDY ON WEDNESDAY.  TEMPS WILL BE DEPENDENT ON WHETHER ANY SUNSHINE 
IS PRESENT WHICH COULD PUSH TEMPS INTO THE UPPER 70S.  I DO NOT HAVE 
THE CONFIDENCE OF THIS ATTM...SO WILL GO SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN MOS 
WITH TEMPS INTO THE LOWER TO MID 70S.

STRONG SUBSIDENCE WILL FOLLOW BEHIND THE FRONT WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SO 
SKIES WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY.  WILL GO ABOUT A CATEGORY COLDER 
THAN MOS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT BECAUSE OF THIS.

IT WILL BE BRISK AND MUCH COLDER ON THURSDAY AS 850 MB 
TEMPS/THICKNESSES BEGIN TO FALL.  WITH COLD POOL AND DEVELOPING 
CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT WITH UPR TROF...WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY 
ATTM.

FRIDAY AND SATURDAY LOOK VERY COLD AS THE UPR TROF...850 MB TEMPS 
AROUND -8 REMAIN OVER THE FORECAST AREA.  WITH THE MAIN JET BEING 
SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER AND COLD FLOW OFF THE GREAT LAKES...A CHANCE 
OF RAIN SHOWERS...AND YES...EVEN SNOW SHOWERS...WILL BE INTRODUCED 
INTO THE FORECAST.  1000-850 MB THICKNESSES SUPPORT SNOW SHOWERS FOR 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.  THE SMALL BUGABOO WILL BE HOW WARM THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE TO ALLOW SNOWFLAKES TO REACH THE SURFACE.  
WILL WORD CHC OF RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
BECAUSE OF THIS.  HAVE GONE COLDER WITH HIGHS (UPPER 30S) AS BKN-OVC 
CONDITIONS/THICKNESSES SUPPORT THESE VALUES.

.ILN...NONE.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS MORNING CONTINUES TO SHOW A S/WV OVER SRN 
MN AND NRN IOWA.  THIS S/WV IS FCST TO MOVE EAST TODAY INTO THE SRN 
GREAT LAKES.  MEANWHILE...12Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A COLD FRONT 
FROM NW MICHIGAN...SOUTHWEST TO CHI...TO PIA...THEN INTO NRN MO.  
THE COMBINATION OF THE SLOW APCHING FRONT AND S/WV WILL BE THE FOCUS 
FOR PCPN ACTIVITY THIS AFTERNOON.

LATEST MESO ETA STILL SHOWS THE BEST LOW LVL CONVERGENCE (925 MB) 
AND UPR DIVERGENCE (FROM S/WV AND RR QUAD WITH ASSOCD JET) ACRS NE 
INDIANA AND NW OHIO THROUGH THE AFTN.  HIGHEST POPS NW CWFA STILL 
LOOK OK.  HOWEVER...WITH THE SLOW APCH OF THE FRONT...BELIEVE 
SHOWERS MAY BE LATE IN ARRIVAL TO THE DAYTON AREA.  THIS IS ALREADY 
REFLECTED IN THE CMH REGION.  ELSEWHERE...AN INCREASE IN 850 MB MSTR 
AND SFC DEWPOINTS WILL GENERATE SOME AFTN CUMULUS CLOUDS.  AN 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION ACRS NW OHIO AND NE 
INDIANA THIS AFTN AS MODEL SOUNDINGS GENERATE ABOUT 400 J/KG OF 
CAPE.  HOWEVER...AN INVERSION ABOVE THE 850 MB LEVEL DEVELOPS AS ONE 
HEADS FARTHER AWAY FROM NW OHIO (I.E. MOVING TOWARD THE SE).  WILL 
KEEP A WATCH FOR THUNDERSTORMS NEAR OUR NW CWFA THIS AFTN...BUT WILL 
KEEP THE CURRENT FCST TREND ATTM TO LEAVE IT OUT.

TEMPS LOOK GOOD AS ILN SOUNDING YIELDS 75 DEGREES IN FULL SUN AND 72

ILLINOIS.  MODELS AGREE IN WASHING OUT THIS SFC FEATURE OVERNIGHT AS 
IT PUSHES INTO NW OHIO.  S/WV ENERGY ALOFT COMBINED WITH MAINLY MID 
LVL MSTR WILL KEEP SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY ACRS THE FCST AREA.  AS A

OTHER THAN SOME MID LVL CLOUDINESS LINGERING ACRS THE NORTH SATURDAY 
MORNING...THE SKY CONDITION IS FCST TO BE MOSTLY SUNNY.  A SOUTHWEST 
FLOW COMBINED WITH SUNSHINE SHOULD BOOST TEMPS CLOSE TO MOS 
GUIDANCE...THUS WILL STICK CLOSE.

MSTR.  HOWEVER...ATTM...WILL LEAN TOWARD MORE CONSERVATIVE ETA AND 
KEEP SKIES PARTLY SUNNY (THINKING MOST OF THE CLOUD COVER WILL BE OF

DEVELOP OVER THE WEST.  WILL LEAVE A LOW CHANCE POP WEST AND REMOVE 
FROM THE EAST.

FLOW SETS UP FOR SATURDAY AND INTO THE LATTER PERIODS OF THE FCST 
WITH VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF S/W ENERGY AFFECTING FCST AREA UNTIL 
SUN PM MON AM. AVN HINTS AT A STRONG S/W SKIRTING N OF ILN BUT 
CANADIAN MODEL ONLY INCREASES H7 RH VALUES. SFC HI TO THE SOUTHEAST 
WITH RIDGE EXTENDING WELL INTO THE GULF SHOULD LIMIT AVAILABLE 
MOISTURE AND SHUNT ANY PRECIP TO THE NORTH. CURRENT FCST HAS CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS IN NORTH 1/2 AND WILL KEEP THIS IN WITH A 30 POP.

THIS CDFNT IS ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD CUTOFF LOW ENTERING THE GT LKS

THE SFC LOW OVER THE DAKOTAS WITH MEAN SFC TROF STRETCHING TO TX ON

OTHER. WILL CUT THE SHOWERS OFF ON TUESDAY BASED ON MRF AND CONTINUE 
THE CHANCE ON WEDNESDAY EVERYWHERE...ADDING THE MENTION OF THUNDER

CONFIDENCE GOES SOUTH AFTER PASSAGE OF SUCH A STRONG SYSTEM. WILL 
PLAY IT CLOUDY WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE NORTH 1/2. AHEAD OF THIS 
SYSTEM...TUESDAY FEED FROM THE SOUTHWEST LOOKS STRONG AND TEMPS 
SHOULD BE UNSEASONABLY MILD...ESPECAILLY ON PM LOWS. WED COULD ALSO

MID TO HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTWAVE OVER THE PLAINS ARE 
ADVANCING EASTWARD QUICKLY.  THE LEADING EDGE IS ERODING A 
LITTLE...ESPECIALLY ON THE SE QUARTER.  STILL EXPECT THEM TO BE INTO 
THE FA DURING THE AFTERNOON.  WILL ADD MENTION OF SOME CLOUDINESS TO 
THE ZONES THAT ARE CURRENTLY MOSTLY SUNNY.  WILL ALSO ADJUST SW 
ZONES TO CHANGE FROM INCREASING CLOUDINESS TO PARTLY CLOUDY.

WINDS ARE CURRENTLY SW AND ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THEY MIGHT BACK

SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR SOUTH WITH DESCENT 
PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER FA.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CLOUDS HAVE 
CLEARED.  WATER VAPOR SHOWS NICELY WAVE OVER WESTERN KS.

MODELS ARE IN CLOSER AGREEMENT WITH DEVELOPING LOW OVER FA TONIGHT 
AND INTO EASTERN GREAT LAKES ON TUESDAY.  AVN HAS BEEN THE MOST 
CONSISTENT WITH PLACEMENT AND DEPTH OF SYSTEM FROM RUN TO RUN.  THIS 
ETA RUN IS FASTER THAN THE 12Z RUN BUT SLOWER COMPARED TO THE 00Z 
RUN.  IT APPEARS THE ETA IS TRYING TO LOCK ONTO THE CONSISTENT AVN 
SOLUTION. 

SUNNY SKIES WILL GIVE WAY TO INCREASING CLOUDS IN THE WEST AS SYSTEM 
OVER WESTERN KS BEGINS TO AFFECT FA.  WILL HOLD OFF PRECIP UNTIL 
OVERNIGHT AS DEEPENING WAVE DEVELOPS LOW OVER OHIO AND THEN MOVES IT 
INTO NEW ENGLAND.  JET STRUCTURE AND STRONG LOW LEVEL Q-CONVERGENCE 
WILL BRING MODERATE TO HEAVY SHOWERS TO FA TONIGHT.  JET SUPPORT 
OVERNIGHT WILL COME IN THE FORM OF AN 850 LOW LEVEL JET AND THE 
RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 100+ KT UPPER LEVEL JET...WHICH PROVIDES 
A GOOD UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE SIGNATURE AT 
06Z AND 12Z TONIGHT.  Q-CONVERGENCE BELOW 700 MB IS ALSO IMPRESSIVE.

WILL BACK OFF POPS A BIT ON TUESDAY AS SERIOUS SINKING ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF LOW WILL BRING PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER AND SCATTERED LIGHT 
SHOWERS.  THESE SHOWERS WILL AFFECT COMMUNITIES MAINLY NORTH OF I-70 
WHERE LAKE MOISTURE WILL ENHANCE ANY PRECIP.

FWC TEMPS ARE IN DESCENT SHAPE WITH ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENT.

MISILN WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

CONVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH STRONG LLVL JET WL LEAD TO WIDESPREAD

DRYING AT THE MID-LEVELS.  14Z VIS SATELLITE WAS SHOWING A FEW

PROGGED TO MOVE ACRS THE CWA DURING THE AFTERNOON...SO WILL KEEP 30

US WITH S/W ROTATING NE AHEAD OF IT IS NOTED ON ALL MODELS. 
PLACEMENT OF A SLIGHTLY CLOSED LOW AT 60H IN LOWER MIDWEST WITH MEAN

BUT EVEN WITH A CLOSED H8 AND SFC LOW NOTED ON OTHER MODELS...MAIN 
FEATURES DONT CHANGE MUCH. CLOSED PATTERN ENHANCES H8 40-50KT JET

MAIN FCST CHALLENGE THIS MORNING IS GOING TO BE HOW MUCH WARM 
ADVECTION GETS GOING AHEAD OF NEXT CDFNT EXPECTED THURSDAY. PRECIP 
ASSOCIATED WITH FRONT SHOULD ALSO PRESENT A BIT OF CONCERN AS TO 
WHETHER IT COMES IN WED PM OR THURS AM. DRY AIR IN PLACE AHEAD OF 
FNT AND GENERAL WEAKENING OF FNT WITH EWRD PROGRESSION WOULD HAVE ME 
ERR ON THE LATER SIDE OF TIMING PRECIP IN. DYNAMICS GET SHIFTED NE 
WITH GOOD 40-50KT H8 JET IN PLACE LATE WED INTO THURS AM.

UPPER SUPPORT LAGS BEHIND ACTUAL FRONT AND AXIS OF COLD AIR NEVER 
REALLY GETS ENTIRELY THROUGH FCST AREA ON THURS. FRONT APPEARS TO 
BECOME A WMFNT AHEAD OF A MORE VIGOROUS LOW THAT SHOULD AFFECT US

FRONTAL SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BISECT CWFA.  AT 18Z...SFC ANALYSIS 
SHOWED THE FRONTAL ZONE FROM SOUTH OF CLE...AOH...MIE...AND BMG.  A 
SFC LOW WAS NOTED ALONG THE FRONT W OF CVG AND ALSO IN THE VCNTY OF 
PAH.

ALL MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR THE SHORT TERM FORECAST.  VIGOROUS 
UPR LVL S/WV CURRENTLY PUSHING INTO IL AND MO WILL MOVE QUICKLY TO 
THE EAST OVERNIGHT.  THE DPVA WITH THIS SYSTEM...COMBINED WITH 
STRONG 925 MB AND 850 MB LOW LVL FORCING BEHIND THE SFC FRONT 
(KATAFRONT) WILL PRODUCE A PERIOD OF WIDESPREAD RAIN ACRS THE 
WESTERN CWFA UNTIL AROUND MIDNIGHT AND ACRS THE ERN CWFA UNTIL ABOUT 
3 AM OR 4 AM.  INSTABILITY AHEAD OF SFC LOW HAS BEEN HARD TO COME 
BY...ESPECIALLY WITH MID LVL CAPPING.  WILL STILL...HOWEVER...KEEP A 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS IN THE DAY...CMH...CVG AND PMH 
GROUPS...MAINLY FOR THE EVENING HOURS.

WITH PASSAGE OF THE S/WV...STRONG CAA AND SINKING AIR WILL CLEAR 
SKIES RAPIDLY TOWARD MORNING.  COLD AIR BEGINS TO MOVE ACRS THE WARM 
WATERS OF LAKE MICHIGAN ON SATURDAY.  HOWEVER...FETCH IS NOT DIRECTED
ACRS THE ENTIRE REGION.  ENOUGH MSTR FOR THE LAKE COMBINED WITH 
DAYTIME HEATING SHOULD PRODUCE SOME CUMULUS CLOUDS ACRS THE NRN 
ZONES WITH MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS SOUTH.  TEMPS WILL BE MUCH COOLER.

FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER S/WV IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT PIVOTS ACRS 
THE SRN GREAT LAKES.  850 MB FLOW BECOMES MORE FAVORABLE FOR CLOUDS 
TO MOVE INTO THE NRN ZONES FROM LAKE MICHIGAN (WITH TEMPS AT 850 MB 
AROUND -7 C)  FOR NOW...WILL LEAVE PARTLY CLOUDY NORTH AND MOSTLY 
CLEAR SOUTH.  FROSTY OR NEAR FREEZING CONDITIONS WILL AFFECT THE 
REGION SATURDAY NIGHT.

ON SUNDAY...MODELS LINGER 850 MB MSTR ACRS THE NORTH. WILL CONTINUE 
PARTLY CLOUDY THERE WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SOUTH.  850 MB TEMPS AND MODEL 
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST TEMPS ABOUT A CATEGORY COOLER THAN MOS GUIDANCE.  
THUS...FCST WILL REFLECT THIS.

FROSTY CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED SUNDAY NIGHT WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
OVERHEAD ALONG WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.

MODELS ONCE AGAIN ARE A LITTLE SLOWER AND ARE SHOWING A LITTLE MORE 
SOUTHWARD DIGGING WITH SIGNIFICANT S/WV DROPPING SE OUT OF THE NRN 
ROCKIES INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS FRIDAY.  THIS WILL RESULT IN MAJOR 
CHANGES IN TERMS OF PCPN TYPE AND TIMING FOR TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY 
NIGHT.

AT 17Z...COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED WEST OF THE SAINT LAWRENCE RIVER 
VLY...EXTENDING SE INTO SE LOWER MICHIGAN...THROUGH NRN INDIANA AND 
THEN INTO  CNTRL ILLINOIS WHERE IT TRANSITIONS OVER TO A WARM FRONT.
THIS FRONT WILL LIKELY STALL JUST ABOUT WHERE IT IS AS MID LVL FLOW 
JUST ABOUT PARALLEL TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  CURRENT 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY OVER NRN INDIANA WAS BEING CAUSED BY 
AN INITIAL S/WV ACRS THE WRN GREAT LAKES.  THIS FEATURE WILL MOVE NE 
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.  MOST...IF NOT ALL...THE PCPN SHOULD 
REMAIN NORTH OF THE CWFA OVERNIGHT.  MAY KEEP A LOW CHANCE POP FOR 
THE EVENING HOURS FAR NRN CWFA AS A SHOWER MAY STILL SKIM CLOSE TO 
THIS REGION.  OTHERWISE PARTLY CLOUDY FAR NW TO MOSTLY CLEAR 
REMAINDER OF THE CWFA LOOKS REASONABLE.  MODELS SHOW AN INCREASE IN 
850 MB MSTR OVERNIGHT.  HOWEVER...THE ISENTROPIC WAA LIFT NEAR THIS 
LEVEL (300 K) IS WEAK...AND SHOULD ONLY PRODUCE SOME LOW LVL CLDS 
(5K) TOWARD THE MORNING HOURS WEST.  CURRENT MOS TEMPS FOR LOWS 
OVERNIGHT SEEM ON TARGET.

FOR FRIDAY...AS THE SIGNIFICANT S/WV MOVES INTO THE CNTRL PLAINS...A 
SFC LOW WILL DEVELOP ALONG FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  SINCE FRONT IS NOT 
FORECAST TO SAG ACRS THE REGION AS IN PREVIOUS RUNS...THIS WILL 
ALLOW FOR MORE WAA TO CONTINUE INTO THE REGION.  IN 
ADDITION...DEWPOINTS MAY CREEP INTO THE UPPER 50S AND LOWER 60S.  
WITH MORE SUNSHINE EXPECTED...DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 
60S...AND SFC BASED CAPES APCHING 600 J/KG...A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE USED IN THE ZONES FOR FRIDAY (MAINLY AFTERNOON 
WEST AND IN THE AFTERNOON EAST).  WITH 850 MB FLOW INCREASING TO 45 
TO 50 KT...SLIGHT RISK OF SVR THUNDERSTORMS IS NOT OUT OF THE 
QUESTION.

AS THE SFC LOW RIPPLES ACRS OUR NW CWFA LATE FRIDAY AFTN AND 
EVENING...THE COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE SE ACRS THE REGION.  STRONG 
DPVA...WAA AND 925 MB TO 850 MB CONVERGENCE LOCATED WEST OF SFC 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL PRODUCE A WIDESPREAD AREA OF RAIN ONCE FRONT 
PASSES THROUGH.  CATEGORICAL POPS WILL BE USED FOR FRIDAY EVENING.

COLD FRONT SHOULD BE THROUGH THE REGION BY SATURDAY MORNING...WITH 
PCPN ENDING QUICKLY FROM WEST TO EAST.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE MUCH 
COLDER THAN WE HAVE EXPERIENCED OF LATE.  DRY WX AND PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES ARE ANTICIPATED ATTM FOR THE WEEKEND.

THE FIRST MAJOR FROST/FREEZE MAY COME TO THE REGION BY EARLY MONDAY

A LOT TO LOOK AT WITH THE BEGINNING OF A LONGWAVE PATTERN SETTING UP 
FOR THE WEEKEND. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT (WITHIN 
3 DEGREES) THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIGHS FROM 
THE FAN FOR TOMORROW. WILL DISCOUNT HIGHS IN THE MID 70S NOTED HERE 
AND CONTINUE WITH A FCST AROUND 80. OTHERWISE...WILL NOT STRAY TOO 
FAR. ARCTIC AIRMASS INDICATED TO MOVE THROUGH FCST AREA ON FRIDAY 
BEHIND FIRST REALLY GOOD COLD FRONT OF THE SEASON. PRECIPITATION 
QUITE PREDOMINANT DURING THE DAY HERE AND WITH GOOD CAA IT LOOKS 
LIKE IT MIGHT BE A STEADY TEMPERATURE DAY. WILL STICK WITH NUMERICAL 
GUIDANCE AND NOTE A LOWER DIURNAL (<10 DEGREES) WITH HIGHS IN THE 
UPPER 50S.

LONG RANGE MODELS INDICATING THAT THE COLDEST AIR ON SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY MORNINGS WILL NOT BE AS PREVIOUSLY FCST IN THE MID 30S. 
REASONING HERE WOULD BE THE DECREASE IN CLOUD COVER LATE FRIDAY 
NIGHT AS OPPOSED TO ALL NIGHT. CENTER OF HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD BE 
CLOSE TO CWA SUNDAY MORNING WITH A DRY AMS BELOW 500MB. 
HOWEVER...THERES A FAIRLY SERIOUS INCREASE IN MEAN RH ABOVE 500 
THAT WOULD CORRELATE TO THE WARMER OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES FOR THIS 
TIME FRAME. WILL STILL HAVE TEMPS IN THE 30S...BUT DO NOT EXPECT THE 
BEST RADIATIONAL NIGHTS ATTM SO WILL TREND BACK TOWARDS CLIMATOLOGY 
FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS OF FCST. STILL EXPECT TO BE A BIT BELOW NORMAL.

REGARDING CONVECTION AND POSSIBILITY OF THUNDER ON FRIDAY...WILL 
CONTINUE TO HOLD OFF AND REALIZE THAT THE BEST CHANCE WOULD BE IN 
THE SOUTHEAST FCST AREA.

NEXT FEATURE TO LOOK AT IS WINDS ON WEDNESDAY AND THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS. FORECAST RIGHT NOW IS CALLING FOR 10-20 WITH GUSTS TO 30. 
30-40KT JET SHOULD SET UP FROM SW-NE AHEAD OF FRONT AND MAINTAIN 
ITSELF OVERNIGHT. ONLY PROBLEMS HERE IS ITS STILL A WARM ADVECTION

CURRENT FCST CHALLENGE IN SHORT TERM WILL BE LOWS TONIGHT. LOOKING

MOST GUIDANCE NUMBERS IN THE MID 50S. ETA FCST SOUNDINGS ALSO 
SUGGEST UPPER 40S AND ILL LIKELY OPEN UP A RANGE AROUND THE COOLER 
FAN GUIDANCE VALUES AROUND 50-51 DEGREES. CLOUD COVER SHOULD BE

MENTIONED IN NW FCST AREA LATE WED...AS ANY PRECIP SHOULD BE SHOWERS 
TO OUR NORTH...VERY LIGHT RAIN OR SPRINKLES TO THE SOUTH. 
INSTABILITY LOOKS MINIMAL AT BEST AND FORCING MECHANISMS SHOULD BE

AM CONCERNED ABOUT THE FEATURES PRESENT ON AVN MODEL TOWARDS FRI 
MORNING. DPROG/DT AT 12Z FRI SHOWS GOOD CONSISTENCY WITH THE HIGH

ARENT BEING HANDLED THAT WELL.

APPARENTLY...VORT LOBE/SFC TROF/AND FETCH OFF LAKE MICHIGAN WAS 
CAUSING SOME SHOWERS ACRS THE NRN MIAMI VALLEY.  WILL HAVE TO PLACE 
A CHANCE OF PCPN IN THIS GROUP AND CNTRL OHIO GROUP FOR THIS MORNING.
A CHANCE OF SHOWERS OR SPRINKLES MAY HAVE TO BE ADDED ELSEWHERE 
DEPENDING ON RADAR TRENDS AT ISSUANCE.

...PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE FCST TRENDS OF PESKY CLOSED 
LOW CENTERED NORTH OF LAKE ERIE.  FCST PROBLEMS FOR TODAY WILL 
CENTER AROUND CLOUDS AND DEVELOPING CAA AT 850 MB.

06Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A WEAK SFC TROF EXTENDING FROM NEAR CLE TO 
IND.  THIS WEAK SFC TROF WAS BEING REFLECTED BY A WEAK VORT LOBE 
ALOFT ROTATING AROUND CLOSED LOW.  WEAK SFC TROF AND VORT LOBE 
SHOULD BE NEAR THE OHIO RIVER BY SUNRISE.  WINDS WILL GRADUALLY 
SHIFT TO THE WEST THEN NORTHWEST DURING THE DAY BEHIND THE TROF.
BIG FCST PROBLEM WILL BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 850 MB CAA BEHIND THIS 
VORT LOBE.  RH FIELDS INDICATE THAT THE SW PART OF THE CWFA WILL SEE 
DRYING BETWEEN 725 MB TO 700 MB FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DAY.  
MEANWHILE...STRATOCUMULUS/CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE ON THE 
INCREASE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AS THE 850 MB CAA SETTLES SOUTH DURING 
THE DAY.  WITH THE TUG OF WAR BETWEEN SUNSHINE...CAA AND INCREASING 
CLOUDS...WARMEST TEMPS WILL BE IN THE SW CWFA (CARROLLTON) WITH THE 
COOLEST READINGS IN THE FAR NORTHEAST (DELAWARE).  THUS...WILL KEEP 
MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR THE NRN MIAMI VALLEY AND CENTRAL OHIO.  
FOR THE WHITE WHITEWATER AND SRN MIAMI VALLEYS ALONG WITH SOUTH 
CENTRAL OHIO...WILL USE PARTLY SUNNY WORDING AS IT MAYBE MOSTLY 
SUNNY DURING THE MORNING FOR AWHILE WITH CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT AND 
ENCROACHMENT DURING THE AFTERNOON.  FOR THE SW CWFA (CVG 
GROUP)...WILL USE MOSTLY SUNNY WORDING.

FOR TONIGHT...850 MB COLD POOL AND FLOW OFF THE GREAT LAKES SHOULD 
KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY OVER THE NRN TWO-THIRDS OF THE CWFA.  THE 
SRN PART SHOULD SEE PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS AS IT WILL BE FURTHEST 
AWAY FROM THE SOURCE REGION OF THE GREAT LAKES.

ON FRIDAY...PESKY CLOSED LOW WILL BE NEAR SE NEW YORK...BECOMING 
MORE ELONGATED.  ONE MORE VORT LOBE IS FCST TO PASS THROUGH THE 
REGION DURING THE AM HOURS.  STRATOCUMULS/CUMULUS WILL KEEP SKIES 
PARTLY CLOUDY ACRS THE WRN FCST AREA.  A LITTLE BIT MORE MID CLOUDS 
IN THE EAST WILL KEEP CONDITIONS THERE MOSTLY CLOUDY.

THE WEEKEND IS LOOKING BRIGHTER AS HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SFC AND

ACROSS OUR REGION TONIGHT.  AVN IS FASTER WITH THE FRONT...BRINGING 
IN TO CVG BY 00Z THIS EVENING...WHILE THE ETA HAS THE FRONT AT CVG 
AT 06Z TONIGHT.  SLOWER ETA SOLUTION MAKES MORE SENSE WITH LOW 
LIFTING NORTHEAST WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN A MORE GRADUAL EASTWARD 
MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT.

RADAR SHOWS SWATH OF PRECIP ALONG THE INDIANA/OHIO BORDER.  
THUS...100 POPS LOOK GOOD FOR TODAY.  RAIN WILL REACH CMH AND OTHER 
EASTERN AREAS LATER THIS MORNING SO ILL GO WITH SHRA/TSRA 
DEVELOPING THERE.  WITH THE FRONT IN THE AREA...LIKELY POPS WILL 
STILL WORK FOR TONIGHT...AS WILL CHANCE POPS EAST EARLY THURSDAY.  
OTHERWISE... SKIES SHOULD BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY ON THURSDAY IN DRIER 
AIR BEHIND THE FRONT.  

HEAVY RAIN IS LIKELY TODAY...BUT WITH THE RATHER PROGRESSIVE NATURE 
OF THIS SYSTEM...AND WITH THE UPPER FLOW PUSHING THE FRONT THROUGH

THIS TIME.

FWC TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK ACCEPTABLE SO I WONT BE DEVIATING FROM

WILL ISSUE MORNING UPDATE TO RESOLVE TIMING WORDING IN FORECAST AND 
DROP POPS OUT OF THE SOUTH. EXPECT MOSUNNY SKIES IN SOUTHERN FCST 
AREA...INCREASING CLOUDS IN THE MIDDLE AND CLOUDY IN THE NORTH BY 
AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES LOOK REASONABLE WITH A FAIRLY LARGE N-S 
GRADIENT RANGING FROM THE LOW 70S TO AROUND 80.

LOOKING AT THE FRONT YESTERDAY MORNING...TEMPERATURES IN WI/MN DID 
RECOVER SLOWLY EVEN AFTER THE FROPA SO OUR TEMP SCHEMES SHOULD BE 
CLOSE TODAY.

FAIRLY VIGOROUS S/W MOVING SE BEHIND FRONT MAY SPARK SOME CONVECTION 
LATER THIS EVENING...BUT RELATIVE DRYNESS OF AMS WILL MAINTAIN A 
VERY LOW AREAL COVERAGE OF PRECIPITATION. WILL REMOVE THREAT OF RAIN 
TODAY IN FAR SOUTHERN GROUP AS CURRENT RADAR SHOWS LIGHT SHOWERS 
WELL BEHIND FRONT.

VALLEY BY THE WESTERLY UPPER FLOW.  

PATCHY LOW CLOUDS ARE CONTINUING TO ERODE AS DRY AIR ADVECTS IN AS

CONFIRMS THIS TREND WITH CLOUDS AT 1.5KFT BECOMING MORE RAGGED AS 
THEY MOVE SOUTHEAST.  FOG AND STRATUS OVER INDIANA SHOULD ALSO 
DISSIPATE SOON...LEAVING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES IN OUR WESTERN

CLEARING OCCURRING OVER INDIANA.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND ARE CONSISTENT WITH THERE

COLD AIR ADVECTION IS STRONG AT THE MOMENT BUT BECOMES NEARLY 
NEUTRAL BY 18Z.  CU RULES INDICATE MOSTLY SUNNY IN THE WEST AND

FOG.

FWC TEMPS LOOK PRETTY GOOD FOR THE FIRST TWO PERIODS.  HOWEVER THE

COUPLE OF FEATURES TO TALK ABOUT FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE.

FIRST IS SHORT WAVE THAT IS FORECAST TO LIFT NORTHEAST ACROSS TODAY 
INTO TONIGHT.  THIS RUN THE MODELS ARE FARTHER SOUTH AND A LITTLE 
WEAKER WITH THE WAVE. EXPECT CLOUDS TO SPILL INTO THE SOUTHEAST 
LATER TODAY INTO TONIGHT.  AVN PRINTS QPF OFF NORTH OF THE OHIO 
RIVER...BUT FEEL THIS IS JUST A RESOLUTION PROBLEM.  WILL GO WITH 
ETA AND NGM SOLUTION OF KEEPING THE QPF SOUTH OF THE AREA.  REST OF 
FA SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY TODAY.

SECOND FEATURE IS SHORTWAVE AND COLD FRONT DROPPING IN FROM 
NORTHWEST.  FRONT PUSHES INTO NORTHWEST FA BY 12Z TUE.  WILL ADD 
A 30 POP IN THE NORTHWEST FOR LATE TONIGHT.  FRONT PUSHES ACROSS THE 
FA ON TUESDAY.  WILL PUT A 30 POP IN FOR ALL LOCATIONS BUT THE 
NORTHWEST.

18Z SFC ANALYSIS SHOWED A COLD FRONT FROM LOWER ONTARIO (PART NORTH 
OF LAKE ERIE) SOUTHWEST INTO FAR NORTHWEST OHIO...THEN JUST SOUTH OF 
KFWA AND WEST OF KIND.

WILL ONCE AGAIN USE A BLEND OF THE ETA/AVN SOLUTIONS WITH MORE 
EMPHASIS ON THE ETA.

COLD FRONT SHOULD BE THROUGH THE NW CWFA BY 6 PM...THROUGH THE DAY 
AND CMH AREAS BETWEEN 7 PM AND 9 PM...CVG AND PMH BETWEEN 10 PM AND 
MIDNIGHT...AND THE FAR SOUTHERN CWFA FROM MIDNIGHT TO 2 AM.  S/WV 
NOTED ON WATER VAPOR OVER WRN OHIO WILL CONTINUE MOVING EAST THIS 
AFTERNOON.  THIS S/WV WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR MORE WIDESPREAD HEAVY 
RAINFALL.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON THROUGH 
MIDNIGHT...ONLY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM IS 
EXPECTED.  SKIES SHOULD CLEAR BEHIND THE FRONT.  DRIER AIR ADVECTING 
BEHIND THE FRONT WILL BE AT ODDS WITH LEFT OVER GROUND MOISTURE.  
ATTM...FEEL BEST CHANCE FOR PATCHY FOG WILL BE THE CVG...PMH AND 
POINTS SOUTH WHERE DRIER AIR WILL WORK INTO LAST.

ON SATURDAY...HIGH PRESSURE OVER MN WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE 
LOWER GREAT LAKES.  MODELS TRY TO HANG ON A LITTLE BIT OF 850 MB 
MSTR.  WITH CAA BEHIND FRONT...GROUND MSTR AND DAY TIME 
HEATING...BELIEVE BEST CHANCE FOR PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS (FROM 
CUMULUS CLOUD DEVELOPMENT) WILL BE ACRS THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN 
AREAS.

BY SATURDAY NIGHT...A WEATHER SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE NRN PLAINS.  
WEAK S/WV ACTIVITY IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT WILL SPILL SOME CIRRUS INTO 
THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT...CONTINUING INTO SUNDAY.  HOWEVER...THIS 
SHOULD BE THIN AND MOSTLY CLEAR/MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED.

13Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A COLD FRONT FROM CNTRL MI TO JUST W OF 
VPZ...SOUTHWEST TO SPI AND STL.

COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTHEAST TODAY.  A COUPLE OF S/WVS WERE 
STILL DIGGING SOUTHWARD INTO THE WRN GREAT LAKES...WHICH IS THE 
REASON FOR THE SLOW MOVEMENT (MORE LIKE THE ETA MODEL).  VISIBLE 
SATELLITE AND MOSAIC RADAR HAVE SHOWN AN INCREASE IN SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FROM INDIANA INTO OHIO OVER THE LAST 1 TO 3 HRS.  I 
EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.

OVER THE SAINT LAWRENCE RIVER VLY AND A JET DEVELOPING OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VLY.  CONVECTION ACRS ERN INDIANA IS FROM A SMALL S/WV IN THE 
500 MB FLOW.  THIS SHOULD MOVE INTO THE WHITEWATER AND MIAMI VLYS 
BETWEEN 10 AM AND NOON.

BIG PROBLEM FOR THE DAY WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING.  KILN 
SOUNDING YIELDED  1.80 INCHES OF PRECIPITABLE WATER.  THUS 
...THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE EFFICIENT RAIN PRODUCERS.  AT THIS 
TIME...BELIEVE THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE FAST ENOUGH TO PREVENT 
WIDESPREAD FLOODING.  HOWEVER...WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON SVRL 
COUNTIES (DARKE...MIAMI AND CLARK) WHICH HAD VERY HEAVY RAINFALL 
YESTERDAY EVENING (4 INCHES TO AS MUCH AS 8 INCHES).  WILL PLACE 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN WORDING IN ZONES FOR NOW...AND WILL WATCH

THOUGH WE HAD SOME SFC BASED INSTABILITY TODAY...MID LEVEL CAP 
HAS PROTECTED US FROM TSRA FORMATION. 
  
CURRENT FCST HAS SKY CONDITION WELL COVERED WITH MOSTLY CLEAR 
NORTH/PARTLY CLOUDY SOUTH...WITH PATCHY FOG FORMING IN SOUTH WHERE 
DEW POINTS ARE NEAR 70. 

FCST LOW TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S LOOK GOOD IN THE NORTH.  ILL

COMPLEX WEATHER PATTERN AHEAD FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOUR PERIOD.

KILN RADAR EARLY THIS MORNING WAS SHOWING SCATTERED SHOWERS ACRS 
MAINLY THE NRN TWO THIRDS OF THE CWFA.  THESE WERE SHOWING SIGNS OF 
WEAKENING.  THESE SHOWERS WERE BEING CAUSED BY A WEAK VORT 
LOBE/WAA...WHICH WAS NOT INTIALIZED VERY WELL BY THE MODELS.  WILL 
HAVE TO WATCH HOW MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY FALLS APART BEFORE FCST 
ISSUANCE.

SFC ANALYSIS AT 04Z INDICATED A LOW PRESSURE AREA NEAR NE NEBRASKA.  
FROM THIS LOW...A WARM FRONT EXTENDS INTO FAR NRN IOWA THEN SE INTO 
CNTRL ILLINOIS.  A MOIST TONGUE OF 70 PLUS DEWPOINTS WAS ALSO NOTED 
FROM THE LOWER MS VLY INTO NRN IOWA.  ETA AND AVN GIVE A FAIRLY 
SIMILAR SOLUTION REGARDING DEVELOPING MCS OVER NE IOWA/SE MN.  THIS 
MCS...BEING DRIVEN BY A 40 KT LOW LVL JET AND ASSOCIATED H5 
S/WV...SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE REGION TODAY AS THE AFOREMENTIONED 
WARM FRONT PIVOTS INTO AND NORTH OF THE CWFA.  THE REASONING BEHIND 
THIS IS THAT THE MAIN LOW LVL CONVERGENCE (AT THE NOSE OF THE LOW 
LVL JET) SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE REGION...KEEPING THE CONVECTION 
AT BAY FOR MOST OF THE DAY.  THE COMPLEX SCENARIO FOR LATE THIS AFTN 
INTO TONIGHT WILL BE A COMBINATION OF A POSSIBLE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY 
FROM THIS MCS AND AN APCHING COLD FRONT FROM CANADA.  FCST SOUNDINGS 
FOR MOST OF THE CWFA INDICATE A SMALL LOW LVL CAP FOR MOST OF THE 
DAY UNTIL MAX HEATING.  IF MAX HEATING IS REACHED (AND I AM BANKING 
THAT IT WILL BE)...MIXING THROUGH THE 850 MB LVL...CAPES OF 3000 
PLUS J/KG WILL BE OBTAINED...ESPECIALLY ACRS THE SWRN CWFA.  IF AN 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY DOES DEVELOP FROM THE MENTIONED MCS...THIS COULD 
TRIGGER THUNDERSTORMS IN A VERY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT.  IF AN OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARY STILL DOES NOT FORM/MOVE INTO OUR REGION...THE COLD FRONT 
FROM CANADA...COMBINED WITH ANOTHER S/WV OUT OF THE PLAINS...SHOULD 
INITIATE CONVECTION BY LATE AFTN INTO THE EVENING HOURS.  
THUS...WILL GO LIKELY POPS (60 PERCENT) ACRS THE ENTIRE CWFA FOR 
TONIGHT.

ON THURSDAY...THE COLD FRONT IS FCST TO LAY EAST/WEST ACRS THE 
CWFA.  CURRENT FCST OF KEEPING THE FAR NORTH DRY AND CHC POPS CNTRL 
AND SOUTH LOOK REASONABLE ATTM.

TEMPS TODAY WILL BE TRICKY...DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THE WAA AT 850 MB 
POKES INTO THE REGION.  AS OF NOW...I CAN FORESEE MID 80S ALONG THE 
NRN PERIPHERY...UPPER 80S DAY AND PMH GROUPS AND LOWER 90S FAR SW.
TEMPS TONIGHT AND THURSDAY WILL BE CLOUD/RAIN DEPENDENT...AND I WILL 
MAKE A LAST MINUTE DECISION ON HOW FAR FROM MOS I WILL DEVIATE.

WILL ISSUE A SPS HIGHLIGHTING SVR WX POTENTIAL FOR LATE THIS AFTN 
AND EVENING.

LOOKING AT KILN RADAR AND REGIONAL RADARS...THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
DEVELOPING QUITE RAPIDLY NORTHEAST OF THE WARM FRONT.  WILL UPDATE 
ZONES TO REFLECT THIS.  I STILL BELIEVE THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE THIS

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WILMINGTON OH
235 AM EDT TUE AUG 21 2001

COMPLEX WEATHER PATTERN AHEAD FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HOUR PERIOD.

KILN RADAR EARLY THIS MORNING WAS SHOWING SCATTERED SHOWERS ACRS 
MAINLY THE NRN TWO THIRDS OF THE CWFA.  THESE WERE SHOWING SIGNS OF 
WEAKENING.  THESE SHOWERS WERE BEING CAUSED BY A WEAK VORT 
LOBE/WAA...WHICH WAS NOT INTIALIZED VERY WELL BY THE MODELS.  WILL 
HAVE TO WATCH HOW MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY FALLS APART BEFORE FCST 
ISSUANCE.

SFC ANALYSIS AT 04Z INDICATED A LOW PRESSURE AREA NEAR NE NEBRASKA.  
FROM THIS LOW...A WARM FRONT EXTENDS INTO FAR NRN IOWA THEN SE INTO 
CNTRL ILLINOIS.  A MOIST TONGUE OF 70 PLUS DEWPOINTS WAS ALSO NOTED 
FROM THE LOWER MS VLY INTO NRN IOWA.  ETA AND AVN GIVE A FAIRLY 
SIMILAR SOLUTION REGARDING DEVELOPING MCS OVER NE IOWA/SE MN.  THIS 
MCS...BEING DRIVEN BY A 40 KT LOW LVL JET AND ASSOCIATED H5 
S/WV...SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE REGION TODAY AS THE AFOREMENTIONED 
WARM FRONT PIVOTS INTO AND NORTH OF THE CWFA.  THE REASONING BEHIND 
THIS IS THAT THE MAIN LOW LVL CONVERGENCE (AT THE NOSE OF THE LOW 
LVL JET) SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE REGION...KEEPING THE CONVECTION 
AT BAY FOR MOST OF THE DAY.  THE COMPLEX SCENARIO FOR LATE THIS AFTN 
INTO TONIGHT WILL BE A COMBINATION OF A POSSIBLE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY 
FROM THIS MCS AND AN APCHING COLD FRONT FROM CANADA.  FCST SOUNDINGS 
FOR MOST OF THE CWFA INDICATE A SMALL LOW LVL CAP FOR MOST OF THE 
DAY UNTIL MAX HEATING.  IF MAX HEATING IS REACHED (AND I AM BANKING 
THAT IT WILL BE)...MIXING THROUGH THE 850 MB LVL...CAPES OF 3000 
PLUS J/KG WILL BE OBTAINED...ESPECIALLY ACRS THE SWRN CWFA.  IF AN 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY DOES DEVELOP FROM THE MENTIONED MCS...THIS COULD 
TRIGGER THUNDERSTORMS IN A VERY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT.  IF AN OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARY STILL DOES NOT FORM/MOVE INTO OUR REGION...THE COLD FRONT 
FROM CANADA...COMBINED WITH ANOTHER S/WV OUT OF THE PLAINS...SHOULD 
INITIATE CONVECTION BY LATE AFTN INTO THE EVENING HOURS.  
THUS...WILL GO LIKELY POPS (60 PERCENT) ACRS THE ENTIRE CWFA FOR 
TONIGHT.

ON THURSDAY...THE COLD FRONT IS FCST TO LAY EAST/WEST ACRS THE 
CWFA.  CURRENT FCST OF KEEPING THE FAR NORTH DRY AND CHC POPS CNTRL 
AND SOUTH LOOK REASONABLE ATTM.

TEMPS TODAY WILL BE TRICKY...DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THE WAA AT 850 MB 
POKES INTO THE REGION.  AS OF NOW...I CAN FORESEE MID 80S ALONG THE 
NRN PERIPHERY...UPPER 80S DAY AND PMH GROUPS AND LOWER 90S FAR SW.
TEMPS TONIGHT AND THURSDAY WILL BE CLOUD/RAIN DEPENDENT...AND I WILL 
MAKE A LAST MINUTE DECISION ON HOW FAR FROM MOS I WILL DEVIATE.

WILL ISSUE A SPS HIGHLIGHTING SVR WX POTENTIAL FOR LATE THIS AFTN 
AND EVENING.

.ILN...NONE.

SFC HIGH PRES WAS CENTERED NEAR EAST CNTRL KY THIS MORNING.  THE 
HIGH WILL MOVE SLOWLY OFF TO THE EAST TODAY AS A WARM FRONT ACRS THE 
SRN PLAINS STATES PIVOTS TOWARD THE MID MS VLY REGION.  I AM ONLY 
EXPECTING SOME HIGH THIN CIRRUS COMBINED WITH SCATTERED AFTN CUMULUS 
CLOUDS.  THUS...CURRENT MOSTLY SUNNY LOOKS GOOD.  MOS VALUES ARE ON 
TRACK FOR TODAY/S HIGHS SO WILL NOT CHANGE.

THE WEATHER BEGINS TO GET INTERESTING TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

ETA AND AVN BOTH AGREE THAT AN H5 S/WV WILL EJECT FROM THE 
INTERMOUNTAIN REGION AROUND A MEAN UPR LVL RIDGE TOWARD THE GREAT 
LAKES OVERNIGHT.  THIS S/WV WILL INTERACT WITH THE WARM FRONT.  AS 
THIS HAPPENS...WARM...MOIST ASCENT WILL DEVELOP A MCS SOMEWHERE 
AROUND THE NE IOWA/WRN WISCONSIN REGION.  THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE:  
WHERE WILL THIS MCS TRACK AS THE WARM FRONT PIVOTS TOWARD THE OHIO 
VLY?  MODELS TEND TO HAVE A TOUGH TIME PINPOINTING THE EXACT TRACK 
OF AN MCS.  BASED ON THE 850 MB-300 MB THICKNESS PATTERN...MCS 
SHOULD MOVE TOWARD NRN INDIANA AND NW OHIO LATE TONIGHT...THEN ACRS 
THE REMAINDER OF THE FCST AREA ON WEDNESDAY.  HOW FAR SOUTH IT GETS 
WILL DEPEND ON THE EXACT LOCATION OF INITIATION.  FOR NOW...WILL GO 
50 POPS LATE TONIGHT FAR NW...30 POPS DAY AND CMH GROUPS TOWARD 
DAYBREAK AND LEAVE CVG AND PMH DRY.  ON WEDNESDAY...50 POPS NRN 
THREE ZONES (WAP...DAY...CMH) SEEM REASONABLE ATTM WITH 40 POPS 
SOUTH.  TEMPS WILL BE TRICKY ON WEDNESDAY WITH VERY WARM AIR TRYING 
TO PIVOT INTO THE REGION.  HOWEVER...WITH EXPECTED DEBRIS CLOUDS AND 
PCPN...WILL NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM MOS.  AS OF NOW...WARM FRONT MAY 
GET AS FAR NORTH AS A TOL TO CMH TO MARRIETA OH LINE.  THE FLY IN 
THE OINTMENT WILL BE THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY THE MCS LAYS OUT.  IT WILL 
LIKELY RETARD THE NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OF THE WARM FRONT.  AS A 
RESULT...THE AFOREMENTIONED WARM FRONT...WHERE IT DECIDES TO

BE OVER THE SRN CWFA.  WILL GO 40 POPS FAR NORTH AND 50 SOUTH

CYCLONIC FLOW WL RELAX ACROSS THE OH VLY THIS EVENING.  THIS

H8 FLOW IS PROGD TO BECOME MORE ANTICYCLONIC ON TUE WHICH SHOULD 
KEEP CU DEVELOPMENT DOWN SOME.  WL GO WITH M/S.

MODELS INDICATE STRONG RIDGING BUILDING INTO THE OH VLY ON TUE

SYSTEM MAY ROLL SEWD ALONG THE 850-300 THICKNESSES INTO THE NRN 
MIAMI VLY BY DAYBREAK.  OTHERWISE...WAA WL LEAD TO AC FORMATION SO

HAVE TIMED THIS CONVECTION INTO THE WESTERN COUNTIES AT OR JUST

UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IS FORECAST TO 
DROP SOUTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND DEEPEN.  ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
LOW IS A 70 KT 300 MB CURVED JET.  AHEAD OF THIS JET IS A VERY 
STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE....WITH IS COUPLED WITH LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE.  SPC HAS ALREADY BOXED CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE

UPPER AIR PATTERN SHOWS H5 RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY.
NEXT TROF WILL APPROACH ON THURSDAY AS STRONG SHORT WAVE DROPS FROM 
CENTRAL CANADA THROUGH MICHIGAN.  LATEST MODEL RUN INDICATES SLOWER 
PROGRESS AND STRENGTHENING OF THE TROF WRT TO PREVIOUS RUNS.

SFC PATTERN SHOWS RIDGE EXTENDING FROM MISSOURI THROUGH NEW ENGLAND 
WITH AXIS ACROSS OUR AREA.  RIDGE AXIS WILL SLIDE TO THE EAST COAST 
BY 00Z THIS EVENING.  COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA THURSDAY 
WITH MOST OF ENERGY CLOSER TO THE SHORT WAVE TO OUR NORTH.  MODEL 
INSTABILITY IS RATHER LOW FOR THURSDAY BUT HELICITY IS FAIRLY 
IMPRESSIVE.  

PARTLY SUNNY WILL WORK FOR TODAY WITH MID AND HIGH CLOUDS MOVING 
IN.  SOME CLOUDS WILL STICK AROUND TONIGHT IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT. 

NEARLY PERPENDICULAR UPPER FLOW WRT THE FRONT WILL CAUSE THE FRONT 
TO PROGRESS RATHER QUICKLY...SO HEAVY RAIN MAY NOT BE AS MUCH OF 
PROBLEM AS EARLIER THIS SUMMER.  HOWEVER...ILL KEEP THURSDAYS POPS 
HIGHER THAN FWC IN THE LIKELY RANGE.

FWC TEMPS LOOK A BIT OPTIMISTIC FOR DAYTIME HIGHS. LOWS TONIGHT LOOK

12Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A COLD FRONT FROM NEAR HTS TO LEX TO PAH.  
THE COLD FRONT SHOULD SLIP FARTHER SOUTH TODAY.  HIGH PRESSURE WAS 
LOCATED OVER WISCONSIN.

THE SFC HIGH WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION THROUGH TODAY.  VISIBLE 
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWED SOME AC/ACCAS LINGERING ACRS THE SRN CWFA.  
THESE SHOULD DISSIPATE AND BE REPLACED WITH DIURNAL CUMULUS.   DRIER 
AIR IN TERMS OF DEWPOINTS WAS SLOWLY ADVECTING SOUTH.  HOWEVER ...60 
+ DEWPOINTS WERE LINGERING NEAR AND SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER.  THIS 
SEEMS TO BE INFLUENCED BY A WEAK INVERTED TROF EXTENDING FROM CVG 
TOWARD IND.  MOST LOCATIONS WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY...EXCEPT SOUTH OF 
THE RIVER WHERE CUMULUS WILL LIKELY BECOME BROKEN DUE TO THE HIGHER

MORNING UPDATE MAINLY TO REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. EXPECT DEVELOPMENT TO CONTINUE NW OF FCST AREA ALONG 
PRE-FRONTAL BOUNDARY CURRENTLY HEADING TOWARDS LIMA AREA. THE FEW 
BREAKS IN THE LOW OVERCAST OVER SE 1/3 OF OH SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
INCREASE...BUT THIS WILL ALLOW SFC MOISTURE TO DEVELOP INTO 
AFTERNOON CONVECTION WITH A LITTLE EXTRA HEATING.

WILL RAISE POPS TO THE 50 PERCENT MARK IN NORTHWEST AND HAVE IT 
UNIFORM ACROSS ENTIRE FCST AREA. MIDDLE 80S IN CENTRAL OH TOO COOL 
AS ITS ALREADY 80-81 OVER MUCH OF FRANKLIN COUNTY. WILL BUMP TEMPS 
HERE TO UPPER 80S.

CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO THE FCST FOR TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY.

AT 03Z...A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM NRN LOWER MI SOUTHWEST INTO 
NRN IL...THEN EXTENDING INTO NRN MISSOURI.  THIS FRONT IS FCST TO 
SLOWLY SAG INTO THE REGION TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT.

KILN RADAR SHOWED CONVECTION OCCURRING ACRS THE CWFA WITH THE 
GREATEST CONCENTRATION OVER THE SE CWFA.  THIS CONVECTION WAS IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH A WEAK VORT MAX FROM THE REMNANTS OF BARRY.  THIS 
S/WV IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SLOWLY EAST TODAY INTO WEST VA...SHEARING 
AS IT DOES.  MEANWHILE...THERE IS A MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN THE MODELS 
AS TO HOW FAST THE AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE 
REGION.  THE ETA MODEL HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN ITS OWN TRENDS...BEING 
MUCH SLOWER THAN THE AVN/NGM.  WITH MID LVL FLOW EXPECTED TO BECOME 
WEAKER TODAY AND ZONAL...I HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT THIS 
FRONT IS GOING TO BE SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER BY 18Z.  WITH THAT 
SAID...I AM SIDING WITH THE SLOWER ETA SOLUTION...WHICH SLOWLY SAGS 
THE FRONT TOWARD THE OHIO RIVER TONIGHT.  THE ETA DEVELOPS A WEAK 
SFC LOW ON THE FRONT INTO WEST CENTRAL OHIO DURING THE AFTN.  SINCE 
THIS IS THE FIRST RUN THAT HAS SHOWN THIS...WILL NOT BITE ON THIS 
FEATURE YET.  REGARDLESS...IF ENOUGH INSOLATION IS MET TODAY...2000 
TO 3000 J/KG OF CAPE COMBINED WITH LOW LVL CONVERGENCE AT THE SFC 
AND 925 MB SHOULD DEVELOP AREAS OF CONVECTION ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE 
FRONT.  PRECIPITATBLE WATER VALUES WILL REMAIN HIGH TODAY BETWEEN 
1.50 AND 2.00...PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH.  WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY 
FLASH FLOOD WATCH...ALTHOUGH LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE.  

FOR TONIGHT...WILL KEEP AN EVENING CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS 
EVERYWHERE.

ON SATURDAY...OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY SEEMS TO LAY OUT NEAR THE OHIO 
RIVER.  MAY THROW A 30 PERCENT CHANCE OF AN AFTERNOON SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE SOUTH AS INSTABILITY IS STILL PROGGED THERE 
(BASED ON THE ETA MODEL).

WITH SLOWER FRONTAL MOVEMENT...TEMPERATURES WILL BE AFFECTED...AND 
PLAN ON GOING WARMER WITH HIGHS AND LOWS THAN MOS GUIDANCE.

.ILN...NONE.

SCATTERED AIRMASS CONVECTION AHEAD OF S/W EXPECTED TO CONTINUE INTO  
THE EVENING. A RELATIVE LULL EXPECTED DURING A PERIOD OVERNIGHT AS 
THERMAL RIDGE AND MIN IN LLVL RH PROVIDES A BREAK IN MOISTURE 
AVAILABILITY AND THERMODYNAMIC SUPPORT. HOWEVER...SECOND S/W 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT SHOULD PROVIDE STRONG LIFT AND A GOOD 
CHANCE OF RAIN LATER OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY TO THE NORTHWEST. 

POPS TONIGHT WILL MENTION EVENING WORDING OR THROUGH MIDNIGHT IN 
EAST/SOUTHEAST AND TRY TO MENTION A BREAK IN THE NORTHWEST BUT WILL 
GO WITH LIKELY WORDING HERE. WOULD LIKE TO GO WITH THE MENTION OF 
HEAVY RAIN POSSIBILITY TONIGHT...BUT THINK THAT CONVECTION MAY BE 
SCATTERED ENOUGH AND MOVE JUST QUICK ENOUGH THAT THIS WOULDNT BE 
ENTIRELY REASONABLE.

WILL TRY AND GET A LITTLE FANCY WITH GFE AND TIMING OF FRONTAL 
PASSAGE TOMORROW. THIS WILL LIKELY CREATE A GOOFY ZONE BREAKDOWN 
FROM NW-SE AND AM CONCERNED ABOUT TEMPERATURE SCHEME FOR HIGHS 
DURING THE DAY. STRONG CAA BEHIND FRONT TODAY WILL LIKELY KEEP 
READINGS STEADY TO THE NORTHWEST IN THE UPPER 70S BEHIND FRONT. 
HOWEVER...BEST CAA IS NOTED TODAY AND NOT TOMORROW. COLD POOL STAYS 
NORTH OF FCST AREA AND SUSPECT THAT SOUTHEAST COULD BE SNEAKY WARM 
AROUND 90...BUT WOULD NEED A GOOD 2-3 HOURS OF SUNSHINE THAT DOES 
NOT SEEM TO BE REALIZED BY MODELS HERE. WILL MOS OUT IN SOUTHEAST 
AND TRY TO UNDERCUT IT FROM THE NORTHWEST AS TEMPS STAY NEARLY 
STEADY BEHIND FRONT. 

ON SATURDAY...EXPECT MORE OF THE SAME WITH TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM 
THE LOW 80S TO THE NORTH WITH SCATTERED PM CU...MIDDLE 80S IN THE 
SOUTH...DEPENDING STRONGLY ON CLOUD COVER. WILL PROBABLY GO THE 
MIDDLE GROUND IN ALL AREAS AND JUST OPEN UP AN 80-85 RANGE AS MORE 
CLOUD COVER EXPECTED IN THE SOUTH.

S/WV AND ASSOCIATED SHRA/TSRA ACTIVITY IS PROGD TO AFFECT FA 
OVERNIGHT AND ON FRI.  STORM MOTION SHOULD BRING THE MOST WIDESPREAD 
ACTIVITY INTO CVG-DAY AREAS TONIGHT.  MODELS PROG PRECIP WATER

LATEST SFC ANALYSIS INDICATED A FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDING FROM KS 
NEWD INTO NRN IL AND THEN EWD ACROSS EXTREME SRN MI.  A MID LVL S/WV 
TO THE NW HAS ACTIVATED OLD CONVERGENT BOUNDARY ACROSS FA THIS AM 
WITH WDLY SCT SHRA/TSRA.

THE S/WV OR MCV IS PROGD TO MOVE ACROSS THE OH VLY TODAY.  ETA SHOWS 
PLENTLY OF ASSOCIATED LLVL CONVERGENCE ALONG THE BOUNDARY.  XPCT 
SHRA/TSRA ACTIVITY TO DEVELOP WITH THE BEST COVERAGE ALONG AND N OF 
THE OLD CONVERGENT BOUNDARY. WL CARRY LIKELY POPS DAY-CMH-CVG AND 
CHC FOR NRN KY AND PMH.  ISOLD HEAVY RAINFALL IS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY 
ALONG THE BOUNDARY WITH SLOW STORM MOVEMENT.

THE FRONT WL SLOWLY SLIDE SWD TONIGHT.  WITH CONTINUED LLVL 
CONVERGENCE ALONG THE BOUNDARY...XPCT MCS DEVELOPMENT ACROSS FA.  
THE ETA INDICATES PW VALUES AROUND 2 INCHES AND A WARM CLOUD DEPTH 
APPROACHING 14KFT...IE 2KFT HIGHER THAN FOR THE CINCINNATI FLOOD 
LAST WEEK. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO A VERY EFFICIENT RAIN PROCESS SO WL 
MENTION HEAVY RAINFALL FOR ALL GROUPS BUT THE NRN MIAMI VLY TONIGHT.

TIMING OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS IN QUESTION SO WL KEEP A CHC OF 
SHRA/TSRA FOR MOST OF FA ON THU.

ARE IN THE LOWER 70S ACROSS THE WEST.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING 
MAINLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH WATER VAPOR SHOWING UPPER 
FLOW FROM THE UPPER MS VLY/WRN GREAT LAKES.

MORNING SOUNDING INDICATES HIGHS NEAR 90 WHICH AGREES WITH USING 
LOCAL TECHNIQUES WITH THE 06Z MESOETA...SO WILL UP WEST AND CENTRAL 
OHIO TO AROUND 90.  WITH TDS EXPECTED IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 70S IN 
THE WEST WILL ADD HEAT INDEX WORDING TO WESTERN ZONES.  BELIEVE 
CU/CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON WILL PREVENT DAYTON AND HAMILTON 
COUNTIES FROM EXCEEDING HEAT INDEX OF 100 DEGREES AND IF THEY DO IT 
WILL BE FOR ONLY A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME.  THE SITUATION WILL BE 
MONITORED.

CONVECTION IS THE NEXT CONCERN.  BY LATE AFTERNOON AND THIS 
EVENING...SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED.  THE COMBINATION OF 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES...>2000 J/KG...MAX SFC DELTA THETA-E DIFFERENCE 
NEAR 40 DEGREES AND WET BULB AROUND 10 KFT WILL ALLOW SOME OF THESE 
STORMS TO BE PULSE SEVERE.  HEAVY RAINERS WILL ALSO BE A THREAT AS

NORTHERLY FLOW ALOFT PERSISTS WITH H5 TROF ALONG THE EAST COAST AND 
H5 HIGH OVER TEXAS.  THOUGH MOST OF UPPER SUPPORT HAS DROPPED SOUTH 
OF HERE FOR THE TIME BEING...A WEAK VORT MAX CURRENTLY NEAR LAKE 
MICHIGAN IS ROUNDING THE TOP OF THE RIDGE TOWARD OUR AREA TODAY.

SFC MAP SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER EASTERN NEW YORK...WITH A 
POORLY DEFINED EAST-WEST BOUNDARY BETWEEN SDF AND CVG.  WEAK LOW 
ALONG THE BOUNDARY NEAR SDF HAS 74 DEW POINTS POOLING AROUND IT.  

RADAR SHOWS SHRA/TSRA SOUTH OF COLUMBUS WITH HOURLY RATES AS HIGH AS 
1.9 (SEE FFSILN).  ACTIVITY IS MOVING SLOWLY SOUTH IN UPPER 
FLOW...TOWARD MORE UNSTABLE AIR INVOF SFC BOUNDARY. 

FOR THIS UPDATE...ILL KEEP CHC/SCT POPS WITH SCT TSRA ALREADY 
OCCURRING AND MORE EXPECTED TO FORM WITH PVA PROVIDING SOME UPPER 
SUPPORT IN OUR UNSTABLE AIRMASS.  THE LACK OF STRONG FORCING SHOULD 
PREVENT WIDESPREAD AREAS OF PRECIP FROM FORMING...SO SCT POPS WILL 
STILL WORK.  

FCST TEMPS LOOK GOOD EXCEPT NEAR CVG WHERE IT HAS ALREADY REACHED 80 
AT 9 AM.  ILL RAISE THE CVG GROUP TO UPPER 80S WHILE LEAVING REST 
OF GROUPS TEMPS AS IS.

DIFFICULT FCST FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 48 HRS AS CHC/S OF PCPN DEPENDENT
ON MODEL/S RESOLUTION OF MCS DEVELOPMENT.

04Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A STATIONARY BOUNDARY ACRS THE WRN GREAT 
LAKES.  MEANWHILE...A BROAD SE TO S FLOW ACRS THE PLAIN STATES WAS 
ADVECTING 70 TO 75 DEWPOINTS NORTHWARD.

MODELS ARE IN SIMILAR AGREEMENT FOR TODAY/S FCST.  AN INCREASING SW 
FLOW ALOFT WILL ADVECT A VERY MOIST AIRMASS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  A 
WEAK LOW LVL JET POISED ACRS THE SRN CWFA WILL BRING THE BEST CHC OF 
SHOWERS AND TSTMS THERE (MAINLY IN THE AFTN).  FOR THE NORTH...CHC/S 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MORE DIABATICALLY DRIVEN...SO 
EXPECT A SML CHC (30 PERCENT) DURING THE AFTN HOURS.

FOR TONIGHT...AVN MODEL...AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE MESO 
ETA...SHOWS A WEAK S/WV (CURRENTLY OVER NEBRASKA)...MOVING SE INTO 
THE REGION.  WITH A MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE COMBINED WITH THE PASSAGE 
OF THE S/WV...WILL KEEP A 30 POP IN ALL LOCATIONS.

THE BIG QUESTION FOR WEDNESDAY WILL BE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A MCS ACRS 
THE UPR MS VLY LATE TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.  THE MESOETA 
DEVELOPS A COMPLEX IN THE MN/IOWA/WI REGION...THEN ADVECTS IT SE 
INTO THE SRN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VLY DURING THE DAY.  THE AVN IS NO 
WHERE NEAR THIS SOLUTION.  ALTHOUGH THE MESOETA IS SUPPOSED TO 
HANDLE MCS DEVELOPMENT BETTER THAN THE AVN...CONFIDENCE IS STILL LOW 
BECAUSE THE MODEL OFTEN HAS TROUBLE PLACING THE FEATURE IN THE 
CORRECT POSITION (WHICH OBVIOUSLY MAKES A BIG DIFFERENCE IN THE 
FCST).  WITH THE MESOETA/S DEVELOPMENT OF THE MCS ACRS THE UPR MS 
VLY...IT/S FORMATION OF AN MCV HAS A RIPPLING EFFECT...INFLUENCING 
OTHER OTHER PARAMETERS (LIKE SUSTAINING A 925 MB TO 850 MB LOW LVL 
JET DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY WHILE THE OTHER MODELS SHOW WEAK FLOW 
AT THESE LEVELS).  THE BEST SOLUTION AT THIS TIME IS TO KEEP A CHC 
POP IN ALL LOCATIONS FOR WEDNESDAY GIVEN THE JUICY AIRMASS.  

MOS TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE AND WILL NOT DEVIATE MUCH.

ALSO ADVECT SEWRD TOWARD SW PORTION OF FA...ALLOWING SOME OF THIS 
CLOUDINESS TO MOVE INTO THE SW LATER TONIGHT. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT 
ANY OVERNIGHT CLOUDINESS WILL EFFECT LOW TEMPS. THUS WILL ADJUST

MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD WITH BUILDING THE RIDGE BUILDS TO OUR WEST 
WITH THE UPPER LOW BUILDING SOUTH.  THIS WILL IN GENERAL BRING 
COOLER AND DRIER CONDITIONS TO FA BEGINNING LATE TUESDAY AS COLD

THANKS TO IWX FOR COORD.

PASSAGE OF MEAN H5 TROF TODAY ALLOWS FOR BUILDING RIDGE OVER FCST 
AREA FOR A PLEASANT END OF THE WEEK BEFORE NEXT SFC COLD FRONT 
BEGINS TO AFFECT OH VLY LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THIS NEXT 
FRONT IS MAIN PROBLEM WITH FCST AS ETA AND MM5 MODELS HAVE REALLY 
PUSHED IT IN A LOT QUICKER THAN NGM AND AVN MODELS.

RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY ON ETA AT H48 IS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE...AND 
THOUGH THE ACTUAL FRONT MAY HANG BACK A LITTLE...EXPECT CONVECTIVE 
BANDS AHEAD OF IT AND POSSIBLE MCS DEVELOPMENT TO CONTINUE FROM VERY 
EARLY SAT THROUGH THE DAY. GOOD LLJET PROGGED TO SET UP AHEAD OF H8 
TROF OVER GTLKS...BUT NOT ON ALL MODELS. EXACT POSITION OF PRECIP 
AHEAD OF FRONT WOULD BE QUITE HARD TO NAIL DOWN ATTM. CURRENTLY 
THINKING HAS SOMETHING DEVELOPING NW OF FCST AREA AND DROPPING S-SE 
ON SATURDAY IN 700-300 MEAN FLOW. EXPECT DEVELOPMENT TO CONTINUE N 
OF FCST AREA WITH GOOD AXIS OF SBCAPE INTERSECTING WITH RELATIVELY 
LARGE MAXIMA OF 1000-850 THETA E AIR.

WITH THIS QUICKER SOLN IN MIND ON SATURDAY...THIS WOULD LEAD TO A 
LARGER MARGIN OF ERROR AND LOWER CONFIDENCE IN EXTENDED PERIODS. 
THOUGH EARLIER SOLN LOOKS TO BE THE WAY TO GO...SUBSTANTIAL SFC HI 
PRESSURE PROGGED TO TAKE HOLD FOR A FEW DAYS AFTER THIS SYSTEM 
PASSES...SIMILAR TO WHAT WERE EXPECTING TOMORROW. 

GUIDANCE IS RELATIVELY CLOSE...BUT WONT MENTION RECORD LOWS IN THE 
UPPER 40S...AROUND 50 OR LOW 50S LOOK BEST. EVEN WITH DRY AIR AND 
GOOD CAA...MAXIMUM DIURNAL FROM DAYTIME HIGHS TO NIGHTTIME LOWS THIS 
TIME OF YEAR SHOULD ONLY BE AROUND 25 DEGREES...30 WITH VERY STRONG 
CAA.

SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR KRFD BUILDING 
INTO FA.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS SOME PESKY MID AND HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS OVER FA WHICH SHOULD PREVENT RECORD LOWS THIS MORNING...BUT 
WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC SITUATION.  
THE AVN IS A BIT STRONGER AND SHARPER WITH UPPER LOW JUST SOUTH OF 
HUDSON BAY LATTER IN THE FORECAST PERIOD.  THE BIGGEST DIFFERENCE 
FOR FA IS TIMING OF CONVECTION.  ETA BRINGS UPPER LEVEL JET OVER 
GREAT LAKES 48 TO 60 HOURS OUT WHICH IN RESPONSE BRINGS A 40 KT LOW 
LEVEL JET AND SOME INSTABILITY TUESDAY NIGHT.  AVN HOWEVER IS 
QUICKER WITH THESE FEATURES BRINGING CONVECTION INTO WESTERN FA BY 
00Z.  HPC IS LEANING TOWARD ETA SOLUTION.  BUT TO CONSISTENCY WITH 
THE  FORECAST WILL KEEP CURRENT 30 POP IN FOR TUESDAY AS TIMING IS 
STILL IN QUESTION.  THIS MAY NEED TO BE CUT OUT WITH NEXT MODEL RUN.

COLD FRONT FOR JULY 4TH APPEARS TO PUSH THROUGH NORTHWESTERN FA BY 
MID AFTERNOON AND MAY LINGER IN THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH EVENING.  WILL 
TRY TO ADJUST WORDING PER THIS THINKING.

FWC NOT IN TOO BAD OF SHAPE TODAY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.  WILL GO A 
BIT WARMER TODAY AS LOCAL TECHNIQUES PRODUCE TEMPERATURES GENERALLY 
A DEGREE OR TWO HIGHER THAN FWC.

MISILN WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

COVER OVER SOUTHERN FA.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWING UPPER LOW OVER

MARGINAL INSTABILITY 500 TO 1000 J/KG WILL PUT A 20 POP IN THE SOUTH

COLD FRONT HAS MADE IT PAST THE CWFA...LOCATED ACRS WRN PA...WRN W 
VA AND ERN KY.  TEMPERATURES ARE CURRENTLY HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME 
REACHING THE 70 DEGREE MARK.  PART OF THIS PROBLEM IS DUE TO THE 
SHIELD OF CIRRUS ALOFT AS NOTED BY THE IR IMAGERY.  THIS CIRRUS IS 
PREVENTING SOME INSOLATION NEEDED TO TRANSFORM THE LOW LEVEL CLOUDS 
INTO HEALTHY MODERATE CU THAT COULD PRODUCE SOME -SHRA.
ALSO...IF 75 DEGREES IS NOT REACH...THE INVERSION ALOFT WILL NOT 
MIXED OUT...AND THUS THE CURRENT STRATOCUMULUS MAY BE SLOW TO 
DISSIPATE THIS EVENING (BEING TRAPPED UNDER THE INVERSION).  
CLEARING SKIES MAY HAVE TO COME BY WAY OF HORIZONTAL ADVECTION TO 
MOVE SOME OF THE CLOUDS AWAY.  WILL HAVE TO WAIT TO THE LAST MINUTE 
TO ISSUE ZONES TO SEE IF ANY SHOWERS FORM OR IF SATELLITE CONFIRMS 
THAT SHOWERS MAY FORM.  I PLAN ON GOING MOSTLY CLOUDY OR CLOUDY FOR 
THE EVENING HOURS WITH GRADUAL CLEARING WEST AND BECOMING PARTLY 
CLOUDY EAST OVERNIGHT.

FOR SATURDAY...AXIS OF UPR LVL TROF (CURRENTLY FROM WRN ONTARIO 
...MICHIGAN INTO ILLINOIS) MOVES SLOWLY EAST...REACHING THE ERN CWFA 
BY LATE IN THE DAY.  MODEL SOUNDING SHOW THE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED

IN THE OINTMENT IS THE NOTICEABLE ISOTHERMAL/INVERSION LAYER LOCATED 
BETWEEN 675 MB AND 650 MB.  MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THIS 
INVERSION MAY BE SURPASSED IN THE ERN CWFA GIVEN MAX HIGHS IN THE 
UPPER 70S.  HOWEVER...THESE ARE MODEL SOUNDINGS...AND A MINOR TWEAK 
HERE AND THERE CAN MAKE A BIG DIFFERENCE.  GIVEN THE 
UNCERTAINTY...WILL KEEP THE TREND OF THE SILENT 20 POPS IN THE ERN 
CWFA...ALLOWING THE SUCCESSIVE SHIFTS MORE TIME TO EXAMINE LATER 
MODEL RUNS AND THE BALLOON SOUNDING AT 12Z.

SKIES WILL CLEAR SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.  
UPR LVL TROF BEGINS TO CUT OFF JUST EAST OF THE CWFA ON SUNDAY.  THE 
LOWER LEVELS OF THE AIRMASS BECOME A LITTLE DRIER AND MORE 
ANTICYCLONIC.  ALSO...FCST SOUNDINGS INDICATE A STRONGER CAPPING 
INVERSION.  WILL GO WITH A MOSTLY SUNNY FCST.

INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WEST. THE 390 J/KG OF CAPE IN THE 
LOW LEVELS COMBINED WITH AN UPR TROF IN THE VICINITY HAS WON ME OVER 
TO INCLUDE THIS CHANCE.


...PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
12Z SFC ANALYSIS SHOWED A COLD FRONT ACRS OUR FAR ERN CWFA.  KILN 
RADAR ALSO INDICATED SHOWER ACTIVITY JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT ACRS 
THE SE CWFA.

COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST TODAY...ENDING THE SHOWERS IN THE 
FAR SE CWFA IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO.  LOW CLOUDS AND DRIZZLE WERE 
OCCURRING BEHIND THE FRONT AS WEAK FORCING FROM UPR LEVEL TROF TO 
THE WEST AND LACK OF CLOUD SEEDING FROM ABOVE.  MAY HAVE TO KEEP 
DRIZZLE GOING INTO EARLY AFTN.  FORECAST HIGH AT ILN CONSIDERING A 
PERIOD OF FOR LOW CLOUDS THROUGH EARLY AFTN YIELDS 71 DEGREES.  
OBVIOUSLY...THE TEMPERATURES WILL BE DEPENDENT ON HOW FAST THE LOW 
STRATUS DEVELOPS INTO STRATOCUMULUS.  MAY GO WITH A RANGE OF 70 TO 
75 DEGREES WHERE CLOUDS MAY HANG TOUGH.  MODEL SOUNDINGS YIELD ONLY 
ABOUT 390 J/KG BY LATE AFTN ALONG WITH A MID LVL INVERSION.  THERE

INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WEST. THE 390 J/KG OF CAPE IN THE 
LOW LEVELS COMBINED WITH AN UPR TROF IN THE VICINITY HAS WON ME OVER 
TO INCLUDE THIS CHANCE.


...PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
12Z SFC ANALYSIS SHOWED A COLD FRONT ACRS OUR FAR ERN CWFA.  KILN 
RADAR ALSO INDICATED SHOWER ACTIVITY JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT ACRS 
THE SE CWFA.

COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST TODAY...ENDING THE SHOWERS IN THE 
FAR SE CWFA IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO.  LOW CLOUDS AND DRIZZLE WERE 
OCCURRING BEHIND THE FRONT AS WEAK FORCING FROM UPR LEVEL TROF TO 
THE WEST AND LACK OF CLOUD SEEDING FROM ABOVE.  MAY HAVE TO KEEP 
DRIZZLE GOING INTO EARLY AFTN.  FORECAST HIGH AT ILN CONSIDERING A 
PERIOD OF FOR LOW CLOUDS THROUGH EARLY AFTN YIELDS 71 DEGREES.  
OBVIOUSLY...THE TEMPERATURES WILL BE DEPENDENT ON HOW FAST THE LOW 
STRATUS DEVELOPS INTO STRATOCUMULUS.  MAY GO WITH A RANGE OF 70 TO 
75 DEGREES WHERE CLOUDS MAY HANG TOUGH.  MODEL SOUNDINGS YIELD ONLY 
ABOUT 390 J/KG BY LATE AFTN ALONG WITH A MID LVL INVERSION.  THERE 
IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER POPPING UP IN THE WEST...BUT WILL TRY 
TO LEAVE IT DRY FOR NOW.

THIS WAS FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE 12Z MESO ETA RUN.

UPR LVL TROF AND ASSOCIATED VORT MAX OVER NRN MO...AS DEPICTED BY

HOURS AS RAINFALL AND COOLING BEHIND THE FRONT SHOULD TRAP LOWER 
CLOUD CEILINGS ACRS THE CWFA.  BY AFTN...LOW CLOUDS SHOULD MIX

HOWEVER...FCST MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATED A SMALL CHANCE OF A

ANY SHOWER/TSTM ACTIVITY THAT DEVELOPS FRIDAY AFTN SHOULD DISSIPATE

INTERESTING FCST SETTING UP FOR MID WEEK.

LATEST SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WARM FRONT ACRS THE SRN GREAT LAKES.  
THE WARM FRONT WAS ATTACHED TO LOW PRESSURE OVER SE SD WITH A COLD 
FRONT TRAILING FROM THE LOW THRU THE CNTRL PLAINS.

THE AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY TOWARD THE CWFA OVER 
THE NEXT 24 HRS.  FOR TONIGHT...SKIES WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR AS 
SFC RIDGING AND S/WV RIDGING AT 500 MB HOLD.

ON TUESDAY...THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE TO JUST WEST OF THE CWFA BY 
LATE IN THE DAY.  THE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT WARRANTS A SMALL CHC OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DAYTON/WAPAKONETA GROUPS.  OTHERWISE...A 
HOT AND MORE HUMID DAY CAN BE EXPECTED.

ON TUESDAY NIGHT...THE MESO ETA...AND TO A LESSER EXTENT...THE 
AVN...TRY TO DEVELOP  WEAK SFC LOW PRESSURE ALONG COLD FRONT AS IT 
SAGS SLOWLY INTO THE NW CWFA.  THE LOW PRESSURE IS BEING PERTURBED 
BY FAVORABLE RIGHT REAR QUAD OF UPR JET.  IT IS HARD TO SAY ATTM HOW 
WIDESPREAD SHWRS/TSTMS WILL BE...THUS A 40 POP FOR THE WRN AREAS IS 
A GOOD BET ATTM.  THE CHC/S FOR SHOWERS/TSMTS WILL BE LESS AS ONE 
MOVES TOWARD OUR SE CWFA.

ON WEDNESDAY...THE COLD FRONT BEGINS TO STALL OUT THRU THE MIDDLE OF 
THE CWFA.  WITH THE FRONT IN THE VICINITY...I MUST CONTINUE A 40 
PERCENT CHC OF SHOWERS/TSTMS.

THE NEW AVN TRIES TO DEVELOP SEVERAL WAVES OF LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE 
STALLED FRONT THROUGH THURSDAY.  WITH THIS SCENARIO..I WILL HAVE TO 
WET UP THE FCST THROUGH THURSDAY.  IF THIS PATTERN SETS UP...SOME 
LOCATIONS COULD RECEIVE SEVERAL ROUNDS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY 
RAINFALL.  ONLY TIME WILL TELL WHERE AND HOW MUCH.

MOS TEMPS REASONABLE AND HAVE STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO ITS VALUES.

THE ETA HAS TRENDED A BIT FASTER AND STRONGER WITH THE NRN US S/W

AS FOR THE SHORT TERM...HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE. FORCING THROUGH

FRONT ACROSS OUR REGION THIS EVENING.  AS UPPER LOW MOVES TO 
NORTHERN QUEBEC...A ZONAL FLOW WILL BE LEFT IN ITS WAKE OVER THE 
NORTHERN CONUS...WITH RATHER HIGH H5 HEIGHTS REMAINING OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY.  

MAIN CONCERN IS FOR SEVERE WEATHER LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS 
EVENING.  WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED JUST WEST OF OUR AREA..THOUGH STORM 
REPORTS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS SO FAR.  OUR 
AREA MAY BE MORE PRONE FOR SVR SINCE INSTABILITY IS GREATER 
HERE...SO WE ARE CLOSELY MONITORING THE RADAR AS THE LINE MOVES IN.  
SQUALL LINE IS ARRIVING AHEAD OF MODEL QPF PROJECTIONS...WITH ETA 
STARTING PRECIP AT CVG AT 00Z.  FLOODING IS A CONCERN WITH OUR MOIST 
SOIL AND ATMOSPHERE...THOUGH MODERATELY FAST STORM MOTION SHOULD 
HELP.

REST OF FCST PERIOD LOOKS DRY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN RAPIDLY 
TONIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT AND REMAINING THROUGH THE WEEKEND. ETA 
SHOWS WEAK SHORT WAVE WITH LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE EARLY ON 
SUNDAY...BUT LITTLE MOISTURE IS INDICATED AND IT WILL BE COMING 
THROUGH AT A DIURNALLY UNFAVORABLE TIME. THEREFORE ILL GO WITH 
PARTLY CLOUDY FOR SUNDAY.

WARM WEATHER WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEKEND...THOUGH PERHAPS NOT 
AS WARM AS FWC SHOWS FOR DAYTIME HIGHS. ILL ADJUST FWC TEMPS UP FOR 
TONIGHTS LOWS...AND DOWN FOR SATURDAYS AND SUNDAYS HIGHS.

ILN...NONE.

CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS MAINLY CLEAR SKIES ACRS THE CWFA.  A 
COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED ACRS THE PLAIN STATES WHILE AN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE (FORMER ALLISON) WAS PIN WHEELING NEAR ILM.

FCST PROBLEM FOR TODAY WILL BE THE CHANCE OF ANY AFTERNOON POP 
CORN TYPE THUNDERSTORMS.  SOME WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP YESTERDAY ACRS WRN OHIO DUE TO VERY 
WEAK LOW LVL CONVERGENCE.  THE AIRMASS REALLY DOES NOT CHANGE TODAY 
AS WE REMAIN IN A BLOCKING TYPE PATTERN (UPR HIGH BUILDS OVER NEW 
ENGLAND WHILE REMAINS OF ALLISON CONTINUES TO SPIN NEAR THE NC 
COAST).  FCST MODEL SOUNDINGS YIELD CAPES IN THE 2500 J/KG RANGE 
WITH NO CAP TO SPEAK OF.  ALL IT WILL TAKE IS JUST A LITTLE 
CONVERGENCE TO GET A THUNDERSTORM GOING.  THE PROBLEM IS:  WHERE?
I WAS LEANING TOWARD THE CMH/PMH AREAS AS THE CURRENT RUN OF THE 
MESOETA SUGGESTS WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE THERE.  HOWEVER...THIS 
FEATURE MAY SHIFT FROM RUN TO RUN (ANY POSSIBLY COULD STRADDLE 
SOMEWHERE BETWEEN DAY/CVG/PMH/CMH ZONES).  AS A RESULT...I FEEL IT 
IS PRUDENT TO PLACE A LOW CHANCE 20 POP FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF AN 
AFTERNOON TSTM.  TEMPS WILL ONCE AGAIN APPROACH 90 DEGREES.

FOR TONIGHT...MODELS TRY TO SHOW QPF MOVING UP FROM THE SOUTH.  WITH 
A WEAK WIND FLOW AND LACK OF UPR SUPPORT...BELIEVE ANY THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY HERE AND SOUTH OF THE CWFA WOULD TEND TO DIE OFF AFTER 
SUNSET.  THUS...WILL GO WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND LEAVE THE FCST 
DRY.

ON FRIDAY...AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT MOVES TOWARD THE REGION.  A 
FCST OF 40 POPS SEEM REASONABLE GIVEN DAYTIME HEATING AN THE APCH OF 
THE FRONT.  LIKELY POPS FRIDAY NIGHT ALSO LOOK GOOD ATTM AS THAT IS 
WHEN THE COLD FRONT WILL BE PASSING THROUGH.

MAIN FOCUS THIS MORNING IS THE WEAKENING MCS OVER NRN IN...EXTREME 
WRN OH...AND SRN MI.  ALTHOUGH MCS IS WEAKENING...SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY MAKE IT INTO THE NRN CWFA BEFORE 
DISSIPATING.  POPS AND OR COVERAGE WORDING WILL BE A LAST MINUTE 
DECISION.  OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY BUILD ALOFT TODAY 
AND CONTINUE INTO WEDNESDAY.  THIS WILL PROVIDE HOT TEMPERATURES FOR 
THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON.  DESPITE BUILDING HIGH PRESSURE 
TODAY...AIRMASS IS FCST TO BE VERY UNSTABLE BY THIS AFTERNOON AS 
TEMPS RISE TO AROUND 90 AND DEWPOINTS HOVER AROUND 70 (RESULTING IN 
SB CAPES AROUND 3500-4000).  OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM CURRENT MCS WILL 
BE A PLAYER FOR CONVECTION THIS AFTN.  IT IS HARD TO DETERMINE ATTM 
WHERE EXACTLY THIS BOUNDARY WILL STOP...BUT CURRENT THINKING IS THAT 
IT WILL END UP SOMEWHERE SOUTH OF I-70 BUT NORTH OF THE OHIO RIVER.  
WITH HEAT AND HUMIDITY COMBINED WITH THE FOCUS OF THIS BOUNDARY 
...WILL GO 40 POPS FOR CVG AND PMH GROUPS NORTH OF THE RIVER.  FOR 
THE NRN CWFA...MESO ETA IS HINTING AT A MCV CURRENTLY OVER 
IOWA...MOVING EAST INTO SRN MI OR NRN IN BY LATE IN THE DAY.  IF 
THIS HOLDS TO TRUTH...THE RIPPLING EFFECT FROM THIS S/WV MAY ALSO 
KICK OFF SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS ACRS THE NRN CWFA LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON.  WILL ALSO GO 40 POPS THERE.  THE FAR SOUTH SHOULD HAVE 
THE LEAST CHC OF RAIN AND WILL GO 30 POPS THERE.

FOR TONIGHT...PLAN ON LEAVING SOME EVENING THUNDERSTORM WORDING

DONT SEE THEM WORKING AS FAR SOUTH AS MY FA.  ILN SOUNDING IS

3/4 OF THE FA.  WILL KEEP A 30 POP THERE...BUT THERE IS A LITTLE 
MORE STABLE AIR ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES...SO TRY

PRETTY GOOD VORT FROM EASTERN IA TO NORTHERN MI ON TUESDAY.  IN 
ADDITION...IT PRODUCES AN AREA OF -10 LI AND OVER 4000 J/KG OF CAPE

DOESNT HAVE VORT.  FEEL THAT THE ETA IS OVER DONE WITH ITS VORT AND

17Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A WARM FRONT FROM EXTREME SW OHIO...THE 
SRN THIRD OF INDIANA...AND THEN INTO CNTRL IL.

SHOWERS AND TSTMS HAVE NOT DEVELOPED IN A WIDESPREAD MANNER (AS 
PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED).  KEY FOR TONIGHT/S CONVECTION WILL BE THE 
NORTHWARD PROGRESS OF THE WARM FRONT COMBINED WITH ANY LOW LVL 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES/UPR LVL S/WVS.

CURRENT VISIBLE IMAGERY INDICATED ONE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY SLICING 
THROUGH THE CWFA (NEAR MGY AND CMH).  THIS HAS STOPPED THE 
ADVANCEMENT OF THE WARM FRONT FROM REACHING DAY AND CMH.  QUESTION 
IS:  HOW FAR WILL THIS WARM FRONT ADVANCE?  BOTH ETA AND AVN HAVE 
THE WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY NORTH OF DAY AND CMH BY 21Z.  AS OF 
NOW...BELIEVE WARM FRONT MAY MAKE IT JUST SOUTH OF DAY AND 
CMH...THEN STALL AS CONVECTION DEVELOPS TO THE WEST...RIDING ALONG 
AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY.  MODELS SHOW A S/WV OVER NRN MO MOVING 
ACRS IL AND INDIANA OVERNIGHT...AND INTO OHIO BY MORNING.  THIS UPR 
LVL SUPPORT COMBINE WITH WARM...MOIST FLOW WILL CAUSE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACRS THE REGION...MOST NUMEROUS ACRS THE 
NORTH.  THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL AS PW/S REACH 
AROUND 1.5 INCHES.  WILL ISSUE AN ESF (FLOOD POTENTIAL OUTLOOK) TO 
HIGHLIGHT POSSIBLE HYDRO PROBLEMS.  THIS WILL GIVE THE EVENING OR 
MIDNIGHT SHIFT TIME TO PINPOINT THE BEST AREA TO ISSUE A WATCH...IF 
NEEDED.

ON WEDNESDAY...THE WARM FRONT IN THE VICINITY COMBINED WITH WEAK LOW 
LVL FORCING WILL CONTINUE THE THREAT FOR SHOWERS/TSTMS.  ANOTHER 
S/WV PUSHES TOWARD THE REGION BY EVENING.  THIS WILL GRADUALLY SAG A 
COLD FRONT ACRS THE CWFA...DIMINISHING PCPN ACTIVITY FROM NW TO SE.

ON THURSDAY...A FEW SHOWERS WILL LINGER ACRS THE SOUTH...OTHERWISE 
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES ARE EXPECTED.

TEMPS WILL BE CLOUD/RAIN DEPENDENT.  WILL STICK CLOSE TO MOS.

.ILN...NONE.

MODEL DIFFERENCES CONTINUE THROUGH THURSDAY. AT 00Z FRIDAY THE ETA 
HAS 1000MB LOW NEAR CHICAGO WHILE AVN HAS 1008MB LOW NEAR PMH. 
THOUGH I FAVOR THE AVN SOLUTION FOR LOW POSITION...AVN APPEARS MUCH 
TOO COLD AND STABLE.  WITH LIMITED INSTABILITY INDICATED...ILL 
CARRY SHRA LIKELY/TSRA POSSIBLE.

WITH FRONT ALMOST STALLED AND COOLER AIR HAVING TROUBLE MAKING IN

TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND ILL STAY CLOSE TO FWC AT CVG.   
FWC LOOKS A BIT COOL FOR WEDNESDAYS HIGHS SO ILL GO A COUPLE

LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION IS CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE VORT IN 
MO/IL.  THIS CONVECTION IS FORECAST TO LIFT ACROSS THE FA LATER THIS

COLD FRONT THAT WILL SWING THROUGH THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES TODAY AND

TO -2 TO -4 AND CAPES TO REACH 1000 J/KG.  CURRENT FORECAST OF 
OCCASIONAL RW/TRW STILL LOOKING GOOD.

LATEST SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT EXTENDING FROM EXTREME SE 
MI...EXTREME NW OHIO...SOUTHWEST INTO CNTRL INDIANA...THEN INTO S 
CNTRL IL.  A WEAK SFC LOW WAS NOTED ACRS SW OHIO WITH ANOTHER WEAK 
SFC LOW DEVELOPING ACRS S CNTRL IL.

MODELS ARE NOT IN TOO MUCH DISAGREEMENT REGARDING THE NXT 48 HOURS.  
WILL LEAN TOWARD AN ETA/AVN BLEND.

MAIN CONCERN OVERNIGHT WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING/FLASH 
FLOODING.  KILN RADAR CONTINUES TO SHOW SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS 
PRODUCING HEAVY RAIN ACRS SRN OHIO.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO A VERY 
MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS.  PW/S WILL CONTINUE TO BE HIGH...AROUND 
1.7 INCHES ACRS SRN OHIO...SE INDIANA AND NRN KY THROUGH TONIGHT.  
CURRENT ROUND OF SHOWERS/STORMS WILL PUSH INTO S CNTRL OHIO/NRN KY 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTN.  FOR THIS EVENING INTO 
TONIGHT...THE SECOND SFC LOW PRESSURE OVER S CNTRL IL...IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH AN UPR LVL S/WV ABOVE...WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF 
SHOWERS/STORMS TO THE SRN CWFA.  THUS...WILL CONTINUE A FF WATCH IN 
THIS REGION.  FOR THE NRN CWFA...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL GRADUALLY SAG 
SOUTH AND EAST THERE OVERNIGHT.  INSTABILITY/LOW LVL 
CONVERGENCE/PCPN EFFICIENCY WILL NOT BE AS GREAT AS THE SRN CWFA.  
THUS...WILL CANCEL FF WATCH THERE (INCLUDING DAYTON...COLUMBUS AND 
WAPAKONETA).  AREAS OF FOG WILL BE MENTIONED DUE TO SO MUCH MSTR ON 
THE GROUND.

FOR SATURDAY...CLEARING WILL GRADUALLY TAKE PLACE FROM NORTH TO 
SOUTH.  WILL CARRY POPS DURING THE MORNING FOR CVG EASTWARD INTO PMH.
SOUTH OF THE RIVER...WILL CARRY POPS INTO EARLY AFTN.  

BY SATURDAY NIGHT...UPR LVL FLOW BECOMES MORE ANTICYCLONIC.  SFC 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING ALSO TAKES PLACE.  WILL GO MOSTLY CLEAR NRN 
AREAS WITH PARTLY CLOUDY/CLEARING SOUTH.  FOG COULD AGAIN BE A 
PROBLEM SATURDAY NIGHT OVER THE SOUTH...DEPENDENT ON WHEN THE 
CLEARING/DRYING TAKES PLACE.

ON SUNDAY...INCREASING SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST RETURN FLOW IN RESPONSE TO 
A DIGGING S/WV INTO THE NRN PLAINS STATES WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO WARM

WAS HOPING THAT THE RAIN WOULD MOVE INTO THE AREA AND STIR UP THE 
FOG...BUT IT IS SLOW GETTING IN.  FOG IS BECOMING MORE WIDESPREAD.  
WILL ISSUE A DENSE FOG ADVISORY FOR ALL BUT EXTREME SOUTH AND

ORIGINAL DISCUSSION....

COLD FRONT WILL MOVE OUT OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND INTO THE FA 
BY 00Z.  LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION IS ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
FRONT ACROSS MO/IL.  THE AVN WHICH BRINGS A SWATH OF INCH PLUS QPF 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FA...APPEARS TO HAVE INITIALIZED 
BEST WITH ITS QPF OVER MO/IL.  GROUND IS SATURATED FROM THE RECENT 
RAINS...SO WILL ISSUE FLASH FLOOD WATCH.  FFG OVER KY COUNTIES A 
LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE FA...SO AT FIRST WAS GOING TO TRY 
AND LEAVE KY COUNTIES OUT OF THE FFG. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FIRED ALONG 
A BOUNDARY IN KENTUCKY...AND WITH MOVEMENT EAST TO WEST...COULD SEE 
TRAINING...SO ADDED THEM TO THE WATCH. 

MODELS DIVERGE TONIGHT.  AVN/NGM PUSHES FRONT THROUGH THE FA...WHILE 
THE ETA HANGS IT UP ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTH....THEN LINGER SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO SATURDAY.  WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE AVN/NGM 
SOLUTION.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FOR THE WEEKEND.

COLD FRONT WILL MOVE OUT OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND INTO THE FA 
BY 00Z.  LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION IS ALREADY ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
FRONT ACROSS MO/IL.  THE AVN WHICH BRINGS A SWATH OF INCH PLUS QPF 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FA...APPEARS TO HAVE INITIALIZED 
BEST WITH ITS QPF OVER MO/IL.  GROUND IS SATURATED FROM THE RECENT 
RAINS...SO WILL ISSUE FLASH FLOOD WATCH.  FFG OVER KY COUNTIES A 
LITTLE HIGHER THAN THE REST OF THE FA...SO AT FIRST WAS GOING TO TRY 
AND LEAVE KY COUNTIES OUT OF THE FFG. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FIRED ALONG 
A BOUNDARY IN KENTUCKY...AND WITH MOVEMENT EAST TO WEST...COULD SEE 
TRAINING...SO ADDED THEM TO THE WATCH. 

MODELS DIVERGE TONIGHT.  AVN/NGM PUSHES FRONT THROUGH THE FA...WHILE 
THE ETA HANGS IT UP ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTH....THEN LINGER SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO SATURDAY.  WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE AVN/NGM 
SOLUTION.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FOR THE WEEKEND.

NGM TEMPERATURES LOOK TOO WARM FOR TODAY...SO WILL KNOCK A FEW 
DEGREES OFF...WHILE WILL ADD A FEW ON SATURDAY.

DEVELOP TO THE NE OF THIS BOUNDARY.  RAINFALL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN 
GENEROUS BUT NOT EXCESSIVE.

XPCT CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY TO WEAKEN DURING THE MORNING HOURS AS THE

NRN MIAMI VALLEY AND VC CMH THIS AM BUT XPCT REST OF FA TO BE DRY 
UNTIL PEAK HEATING.  WARM FRONT WL PUSH NEWD BUT STILL MAY NOT MAKE 
IT PAST KCMH DUE TO BLOCKING ALONG THE NE COAST.

MODERATE INSTABILITY WL DEVELOP DURING THE PM HOURS AND SHOULD LEAD 
TO TSRA DEVELOPMENT IN THE PM.  WL PLAY PERSISTENCE AND KEEP THE 
HIGHEST POPS WHERE IT HAS RAINED THE LAST 2 DAYS.  SFC DEWPOINTS AND 
CONVERGENCE SHOULD BE MAXIMIZED NE OF CVG AREA.  AM TEMPTED TO LEAVE 
CVG AREA DRY TODAY BUT PRESENCE OF WK CDFNT COULD LEAD TO THE 
BREAKING OF THE CAP THERE.  WL CARRY A LOW CHANCE POP.

WL NOT MENTION SVR TODAY IN ZONES.  SETUP IS SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY

WL CONTINUE THE MENTION OF SHRA/TSRA TONIGHT AS CDFNT DROPS THROUGH

CURRENT FORECAST HAS THINGS WELL IN HAND AND WILL ONLY MAKE A MINOR 
ADJUSTMENT OR TWO. 

AREA OF SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDER STILL LOCATED NORTHEAST OF 
WARM FRONT. WITH CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP EXPECTED FOR THE MAJORITY OF 
THE DAY IN NE ZONES...EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO BE SERIOUSLY HAMPERED. 
CURRENT HIGHS OF 70 TO 75 MAY BE A BIT TOO OPTIMISTIC AND I EXPECT 
TO CUT A TIER OF COUNTIES IN THE NORTHEAST OUT TO DROP READINGS TO 
THE UPPER 60S AND HOPE THEY CAN EVEN MAKE THIS. 

DONT EXPECT MUCH IN THE LINE OF SEVERE WX HERE WITH POSSIBLE 
EXCEPTION OF FLOODING OVERNIGHT. WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT MODELS ARE 
DOING...BUT FIRST GLANCE AND YESTERDAYS THINKING TELLS ME THAT 
ANOTHER MCS TO SET UP IN FAR NRN CWA JUST S OF MI/OH STATE LINE. 
WILL TOUCH THIS WITH AN ESF AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I WANT TO 
ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS IN THE AFTERNOON 
PACKAGE. THINK THAT THE LARGE HAIL THREAT MENTIONED HERE IS GOING TO 
BE DIMINISHED WITH LACK OF LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY WITH TEMPERATURES 
BEING SEVERELY HAMPERED. WILL KEEP THE THREAT FOR HAIL RUNNING NW-SE 
OVER CENTRAL ZONES AND ALREADY THIS MORNING HAVE GOTTEN TWO PEA SIZE 
REPORTS FROM ONE OR TWO OF THE BETTER CELLS.

POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE SHOULD BE LOCATED ALONG THE WARM FRONT AND IN 
THE SUNNIER AIR THIS AFTERNOON WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE AT A MAX. 
CELLS SHOULD BE ISOLATED OR WIDELY SCATTERED...BUT BOUNDARIES MIGHT 
PUSH SOME OF THESE INTO THE BAD CATEGORY. MAIN CONCERN HERE IS FROM 
RICHMOND TO DAYTON TO PORTSMOUTH. WILL KEEP MENTION OF POSSIBLE 
LARGE HAIL ALONG THIS LINE AND HEAVY RAIN IN NE 2/3 OF FCST AREA.

THE DAY IN NE ZONES...EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO BE SERIOUSLY HAMPERED. 
CURRENT HIGHS OF 70 TO 75 MAY BE A BIT TOO OPTIMISTIC AND I EXPECT 
TO CUT A TIER OF COUNTIES IN THE NORTHEAST OUT TO DROP READINGS TO 
THE UPPER 60S AND HOPE THEY CAN EVEN MAKE THIS. 

DONT EXPECT MUCH IN THE LINE OF SEVERE WX HERE WITH POSSIBLE 
EXCEPTION OF FLOODING OVERNIGHT. WILL HAVE TO SEE WHAT MODELS ARE 
DOING...BUT FIRST GLANCE AND YESTERDAYS THINKING TELLS ME THAT 
ANOTHER MCS TO SET UP IN FAR NRN CWA JUST S OF MI/OH STATE LINE. 
WILL TOUCH THIS WITH AN ESF AND TRY TO FIGURE OUT WHERE I WANT TO 
ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS IN THE AFTERNOON 
PACKAGE. THINK THAT THE LARGE HAIL THREAT MENTIONED HERE IS GOING TO 
BE DIMINISHED WITH LACK OF LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY WITH TEMPERATURES 
BEING SEVERELY HAMPERED. WILL KEEP THE THREAT FOR HAIL RUNNING NW-SE 
OVER CENTRAL ZONES AND ALREADY THIS MORNING HAVE GOTTEN TWO PEA SIZE 
REPORTS FROM ONE OR TWO OF THE BETTER CELLS.

POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE SHOULD BE LOCATED ALONG THE WARM FRONT AND IN 
THE SUNNIER AIR THIS AFTERNOON WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE AT A MAX. 
CELLS SHOULD BE ISOLATED OR WIDELY SCATTERED...BUT BOUNDARIES MIGHT 
PUSH SOME OF THESE INTO THE BAD CATEGORY. MAIN CONCERN HERE IS FROM 
RICHMOND TO DAYTON TO PORTSMOUTH. WILL KEEP MENTION OF POSSIBLE 
LARGE HAIL ALONG THIS LINE AND HEAVY RAIN IN NE 2/3 OF FCST AREA.

PUSHING INTO ERN IN AND NRN KY.  IMPRESSIVE MCC OVR MI WAS DROPPING

THANKS TO CLE, IWX, AND RLX FOR COORD...

FAIR AGREEMENT THAT MCS WILL DEVELOP N OF FCST AREA AND TRACK 
SE...JUST A LITTLE NE OF SFC WM FRONT. PROBLEM IS IS THAT MODELS 
SEEM TO BE A LITTLE TOO FAR NE OF FRONT WITH MCS IF YOU LOOK BACK AT 
PREVIOUS RUNS AND LAST NIGHTS MCS. AXIS OF GOOD THETA E AIR JUST TO

WITH WMFNT. EXPECT DEVELOPMENT OF MCS BETWEEN MKE AND GRR AND MOVE 
TOWARDS CMH BY MORNING. WILL MENTION HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE...WITH 
LIKELY POPS IN NORTHEAST...TRAILING TO LOW CHANCE POPS IN SOUTHWEST.

MORNING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DIE DOWN A BIT FOR 
TOMOROW...BUT OUTFLOW FROM MORNINGS SHOWERS COULD MOVE SW AND BLOW 
UP SOME STORMS ALONG THE WM FNT THAT BISECTS CWA FROM WAPAKONETA TO 
PORTSMOUTH. RIGHT NOW...LACK OF A FOCUS IS NOTED ON THE MODELS...AND 
WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS SOUTHWEST WITH MAINLY LATE WORDING 
TOMORROW. SNEAKY WARM TEMPERATURES EXPECTED BEHIND FRONT...WITH SOME 
MID 80S POSSIBLE IN FAR SOUTHWEST TOWARDS LVX. WILL WORD 80 TO 85 
HERE AND QUICKLY TAPER TO HIGHS AROUND 70 IN THE NORTHEAST WITH 
PRECIP COOLED AIR AND CLOUD COVER. FWC NUMBERS DONT LOOK 
UNREASONABLE HERE, BUT WILL TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER MAV NUMBERS 
JUST UNDER AND SOUTHWEST OF THE FRONT...SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE IN THE 
NORTHEAST.

S/W CUTS UNDER RIDGE NEXT NIGHT AND BRINGS EVEN BETTER CHANCE OF 
PRECIP TO FCST AREA...CONCENTRATED ALONG WM FNTL BOUNDARY. 

BASICALLY...WILL KEEP PRECIP CHANCES LOWER SOUTHWEST AND REMAIN 
LIKELY NORTHEAST WITH SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS. TEMPS IN SOUTHWEST WILL

STRATO CU HAS DISSIPATED WITH SUNSET AND AREA OF AC IS PULLING 
EAST.  THAT WILL LEAVE JUST SOME CIRRUS THIS IS DROPPING S ACROSS 
LAKE MI TO AFFECT THE REGION OVERNIGHT.

BIGGEST CONCERN IS LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT.  MID TO UPPER 30 
DEWPOINTS ARE JUST TO OUR NORTH AND WEST...BUT THE DEWPOINTS ACROSS 
THE FA ARE HOLDING UP.  MESOETA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE SHOWING 
THAT THE AREA WOULD STAY IN THE 40S OVERNIGHT...BUT LOOKING AT ITS 
SURFACE DEWPOINTS...IT WAS PUSHING A NOSE OF 50 DEWPOINTS INTO THE 
FA AT 00Z...WHICH DIDNT VERIFY...SO DONT KNOW HOW MUCH TO BELIEVE 
IT.

WITH THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STILL HANGING AROUND FROM YESTERDAYS 
RAINS...DONT FEEL THAT THE DEWPOINTS WILL FALL TOO FAR. LAMP HAD A 
GOOD HANDLE ON CURRENT TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS AT 23Z...AND AS

SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE UPPER MS 
VLY...WHICH IS KEEPING COOL NORTHERLY FLOW OFF THE GREAT LAKES OVER 
FA.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING SCT-BKN CLOUDS OVER FA.

MODELS ARE ALL IN DESCENT AGREEMENT WITH BUILDING HIGH PRESSURE INTO 
INDIANA AND OHIO OVERNIGHT.  RIDGE OF CALM WINDS SHOULD REMAIN JUST 
TO THE WEST AND NORTH OF FA...WHICH WILL KEEP A LIGHT GRADIENT OVER 
FA.  THE BIG QUESTION IS...WILL IT FROST OF FOG TONIGHT?  TDS WILL 
STAY UP IN THE LOWER 40S OVERNIGHT WITH POSSIBLY A FEW UPPER 30S 
ACROSS THE NORTH.  HOWEVER...GROUND IS STILL WET/DAMP FROM HALF INCH 
TO TWO INCH RAINFALL LAST NIGHT.  WIND SPEEDS WILL LIKELY BE THE 
CRITICAL FACTOR IN FOG FORMATION.  BELIEVE COMBINATION OF LIGHT 
GRADIENT...WET/DAMP GROUND AND TDS FALLING TO AROUND 40 WILL MAKE 
THIS MORE OF A FOG NIGHT THAN A FROST NIGHT.  EVENING SHIFT WILL 
HAVE TO MONITOR.

HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN EFFECT UNTIL AN IMPRESSIVE WARM FRONT 
PUSHES THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON.  THERE ARE SEVERAL THINGS THAT 
CONCERN ME ABOUT THIS WARM FRONT.  1) OVER THE UPPER MS VLY/SOUTHERN 
CANADA ON SUNDAY NIGHT IT APPEARS CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP FROM A 
RIDGE RIDER.  THICKNESS PATTERN WOULD PUSH IT DUE SOUTH.  2) BETWEEN 
18Z MONDAY AND 00Z TUESDAY THE WARM SECTOR GETS VERY UNSTABLE WITH 
2000 TO 3000 J/KG.  THE WARM SECTOR APPEARS TO BE CAPPED.  3)  THE 
VORT MAX MOVING SOUTHWARD IN THE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW INTENSIFIES IN 
THE AFTERNOON.  IS THIS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK?  GUT FEEL IS THAT 
CONVECTION WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL EVENING AND THEN FA WILL STAY IN THE

CAP IS FINALLY BREAKING OVER CWA AND CONVECTION FORMING ALONG WEAK 
CONVERGENT BOUNDARIES AT SFC CAUSED BY DIFFERENTIAL HEATING AND 
POSSIBLY SOME LEFTOVER OUTFLOWS FROM LAST NIGHTS STORMS IN THE 
MIDWEST. 

MODELS IN FAIR AGREEMENT THOUGH A ETA HOLDING BACK ON THE ACTUAL 
FRONT A LITTLE BETTER THAN NGM/AVN. REGARDLESS...FROPA DURING THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS FROM NW-SE AND DID NOT TRY TO GET FANCY WITH POPS 
TONIGHT. WENT 70-80 ACROSS THE BOARD AND COULD SEE AN ISOLATED CASE 
OF SEVERE THIS PM WITH DOWNBURST WINDS AND POSSIBLY HAIL. MOST 
MODELS INDICATING SPLIT DYNAMICS OVER FCST AREA WITH A GOOD SHOT TO 
THE NORTH WITH DECENT S/W ALONG H5 TROF. ANOTHER SHOT TO SOUTHWEST 
COMBINES A WEAKER S/W WITH LLVL CONVERGENCE AS SFC FRONT GETS BUTTED 
UP AGAINST RIDGE OVER WESTERN APPALACHIANS. 

WAS CONCERNED ABOUT LACK OF QPF NOTED IN CVG/DAY AREA FROM MESOETA 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...AND STILL FEEL THAT THE BEST CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION HERE IS GOING TO BE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING WITH 
HEATING. SOME SHOWERS EXPECTED WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE DURING THE 
NIGHT...BUT THUNDER SHOULD BE SEVERELY HAMPERED ACROSS MUCH OF FCST 
AREA WITH SETTING OF THE SUN. 

STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPS AND KEPT A SILENT 10/20 POP IN THE

WITH THUNDERSTORM POSSIBILITY. 40KT H8 JET AHEAD OF FRONT THIS 
MORNING REALLY LOSES ITS PUNCH AND BEST UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE 
OCCURS SW-NE OVER FCST AREA AT 0Z ACCORDING TO MESOETA.

SOUTHEAST THROUGH 6Z THOUGH ETA AND NGM DROP BEST LIS AFTER DAYTIME 
HEATING. EXPECT THUNDERSTORMS TO PERSIST INTO THE EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT...BUT LOSE THE BEST PUNCH WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING. 

LITTLE SHEAR TO NOTE WITH THUNDER THIS AFTERNOON AND POSSIBILITY OF 
SVR SHOULD REMAIN FAIRLY ISOLATED.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AFTN WAS SHOWING DEVELOPING CUMULUS 
CLOUDS ALONG AND JUST SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER.  THIS WAS IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH INCREASING DEWPOINTS FROM THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST.  
SOME THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WAS NOTED NEAR THE SE KY/NE TN BORDER.  
THIS ACTIVITY WAS IN RESPONSE TO A WEAK S/WV ALOFT COMBINED WITH 
DAYTIME HEATING.

CLOUD/TEMP FCST WILL BE A LITTLE TRICKY FOR THE NXT 24 TO 48 HRS.  
FIRST OF ALL...S/WV OVER THE KY/TN AREA IS FCST TO MOVE LITTLE AND 
PERHAPS ELONGATE OVERNIGHT.  LOOKING AT MODEL DATA...NGM SEEMS TO BE 
DEVELOPING SOME SPURIOUS CONVECTION ACRS OUR WRN AREAS AND CONTINUES 
THIS INTO TOMORROW.  THIS IS BEING DISCOUNTED.  USING THE 
AVN/ETA...THERE REALLY IS NO STRONG LOW LVL FORCING OVERNIGHT ACRS 
OUR REGION IN CONJUCTION WITH A MOISTENING AIRMASS.  WITH THAT 
SAID...PLAN ON KEEPING A DRY FCST.  CUMULUS CLOUDS TO THE 
SOUTH/SOUTHWEST SHOULD DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET.  AS A RESULT...AN 
INCREASE IN MID AND HIGH LVL CLOUDINESS IS ANTICIPATED ACRS THE WRN 
CWFA OVERNIGHT.

ON TUESDAY...COLD FRONT CURRENTLY ACRS THE NRN PLAINS STATES WILL 
FALL APART AS IT MOVES INTO A MEAN H5 RIDGE ALOFT.  S/WV ASSOCD WITH 
COLD FRONT BEGINS TO STRETCH/SHEAR AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE

FINDING ANY REAL FOCUSING MECHANISM (OTHER THAN SHEARING S/WV) TO 
TRIGGER CONVECTION TOMORROW.  HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE A LOW 30 POP IN 
ALL LOCATIONS GIVEN THAT THE MSTR AND INSTABILITY WILL BE 
AVAILABLE.  THUS...DAYTIME HEATING WILL HAVE TO BE THE MAIN TRIGGER 
MECHANISM FOR POPCORN TYPE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY.

BY TUESDAY NIGHT...ANY DAYTIME CONVECTION SHOULD DISSIPATE AFTER 
SUNSET.  THUS...PARTLY CLOUDY EARLY...THEN MOSTLY CLEAR SHOULD 
SUFFICE.

ON WEDNESDAY...ANOTHER S/WV AND ASSOCD SFC COLD FRONT APCH THE MS

REDEVELOPING H5 MID LVL RIDGE.  WILL LEAVE OUT DAYTIME CONVECTION ON 
WEDNESDAY DUE TO THE INCREASED MID LVL WARMING NOTED ON THE ETA 
MODEL ABOVE 700 MB...PRODUCING A CAPPING INVERSION (DESPITE SAME 
AIRMASS).

WARM CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY UNDER H5 MID LVL 
RIDGING.  A THIRD COLD FRONT WILL FINALLY PUSH THROUGH DURING

SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWING RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE STRETCHED FROM NEW 
ENGLAND INTO THE MID MS VLY.  SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS SKIES CLEAR 
OVER THE REGION.

MODELS ARE ALL IN AGREEMENT WITH KEEPING HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL OF 
FA FOR THE NEXT 5 DAYS.  HOWEVER THERE WILL BE A WEAK COLD FRONT 
MOVE THROUGH ON FRIDAY.  THIS FRONT MAY TRIGGER A FEW SHRA/SPRINKLES 
IN CENTRAL OHIO AND FEW AFTERNOON SHRA/TSRA ACROSS SOUTHERN FA.  ETA 
SUGGESTS CAPE VALUES GREATER THAN 500 J/KG WHICH MAY BE UNDER DONE 
AS THE FORECAST WILL GO OUT WITH HIGHS WARMER THAN THE MODEL 
SUGGESTS. 

FWC TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE...EXCEPT FOR FRIDAY WHERE THE MAV...850 
TEMPS AND 1000-850 THICKNESSES SUGGEST A CAT RISE WOULD WORK OUT 
BETTER.  WILL ALSO GO CLOSER TO MAV NUMBERS ACROSS THE NORTH TONIGHT 
AS THETA-E PULLING AHEAD OF FRONT WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES A BIT 
WARMER.

MISILN WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE FROM NORTH OF LAKE

MOVING INTO NORTHERN IL AND CLOUD SHIELD TO OUR SOUTHEAST.

MODELS ARE ALL CONSISTENT IN WEAKENING THIS WAVE AS IT MOVES EAST 
AND TRIES TO WORK THROUGH THE SURFACE RIDGE.  WESTERN FA WILL SEE 
SOME DEBRIS CLOUDS AS THE WAVE SLIDES TO OUR WEST/SOUTHWEST.  RIDGE 
SLOWLY SLIDES SOUTH TO EXTEND ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN FA.  THIS WILL 
BRING THE THREAT OF FROST ONCE AGAIN TO MAINLY OUR SOUTHERN FA.  
CONCERNED THAT TEMPS MAY FALL TO AROUND FREEZING IN VALLEYS ACROSS 
SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO AND NORTHEAST KENTUCKY IN THE RIDGE AXIS.  
HOWEVER THINK THERE IS AN EQUAL CHANCE THAT RIDGE AXIS WILL SET UP 
JUST FAR ENOUGH SOUTH AND KEEP TEMPS AND TDS A BIT WARMER AS A 
RESULT WILL LET DAY-SHIFT RESOLVE IF AND WHERE FROST HEADLINES WILL 
NEED TO BE ISSUED.

TEMPERATURES FORECAST A BIT TRICKY TODAY...EVEN THOUGH MODELS VERY 
SIMILAR.  LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES AND TEMPERATURES VARY TO 
SIGNIFICANTLY BETWEEN THE AVN AND ETA...ESPECIALLY THURSDAY.  FWC 
TEMPS LOOK PRETTY GOOD DESPITE MODEL DIFFERENCES WILL ONLY MAKE

HAS INCREASED TONIGHTS QPF FOR OUR AREA...WITH ETA AND AVN QPF NOW 
CONVERGING AT AROUND .20.  MODELS LOOK GOOD BRINGING PRECIP TO OUR 
WEST COUNTIES BY 00Z.  CAPPING AROUND 10KFT SHOULD LIMIT ACTIVITY IN 
OUR AREA OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT. 

WITH PRECIP MORE CERTAIN THAN FWC POPS...WILL KEEP SHRA/TSRA FOR 
TONIGHT WHILE INCREASING POPS TO 80%...WITH UNTIL MIDNIGHT WORDING 
IN THE WEST.  WITH FRONT CONTINUING TO ACCELERATE WRT MODELS...WILL

FCST CONCERNS COMING UP WILL GENERALLY BE WITH REGARDS TO

FCST AREA AND SLOWLY WARM IN THE FIRST TWO PERIODS. AFTER THIS...H8 
RIDGE IS OVER TOP OF CWA EARLY THURS AND A RETURN TO WARMER TEMPS IS 
NOTED WITH INCREASING SW WIND. TEMPS CONCERN ON WED PM THROUGH THURS 
WILL BE DUE TO HI CLOUDS SPILLING OVER RIDGE.

WITH DECREASED MOISTURE AND FAIRLY SUNNY SKIES TODAY...WILL TREND 
WARMER THAN GUIDANCE FOR ALL AREAS BUT NORTHEAST. LOWS TONIGHT 
SHOULE BE CLOSE TO GUIDANCE...AND I LIKE THE WARMING TREND ON 
THURSDAY DAYTIME AND OVERNIGHT ALTHOUGH THICKNESSES AND H8 TEMPS 
SUPPORT COOLER HIGHS. 

GOOD LLVL JET TO SET UP LATE THURS TO THE SW WITH STRONG ISENTROPIC 
LIFT NOTED ACROSS OH VLY AND GT LKS REGION. S/W IS PROGGED TO PUSH 
INTO THIS AREA BY FRI MORNING, AND WEAK TROFFINESS NOTED AT H7 BUT

NOTED IN ETA MODEL AT 60 HOURS. HOWEVER, STRONG VEERING/SHEAR OF 
WINDS NOTED FROM SFC TO H8 COUPLED WITH NOSE OF LLVL JET AND 
INCREASED OMEGA WOULD SUGGEST SOME CONVECTION POSSIBLE, IF ONLY 
ELEVATED. WILL WAIT TO MENTION THUNDER FOR THURS NIGHT...BUT PASS ON

MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN FORECASTING THAT COLD UPPER LOW 
CURRENTLY OVER NORTHERN MINNESOTA WILL DROP THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES 
AND INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY 48 HOURS.  

CLOUDS AND SCATTERED SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH INDIANA ARE ASSOCIATED 
WITH A SURFACE TROF. THIS FEATURES WILL SWING ACROSS THE FA THIS 
MORNING.  WILL ADD MENTION OF WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS TO THE 
NORTHERN HALF TODAY.  CLOUDS ARE A TOUGH CALL TODAY.  ETA CURU IS 
SHOWING OVC CLOUDS ALL DAY.  NGM CURU HOWEVER IS HINTING AT SOME 
DRYING WORKING IN DURING THE AFTERNOON. SINCE THE STRONGEST CAA 
DOESNT KICK IN UNTIL TONIGHT...WILL BE A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC AND WILL 
GO WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES IN THE SOUTH.

1000-850 THICKNESSES DROP BELOW 1300M QUICKLY TONIGHT.  WILL 
CONTINUE WITH MENTION OF SNOW SHOWERS NORTH AND RAIN SHOWERS TURNING 
TO SNOW SHOWERS SOUTH.  BIGGER QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT TO MENTION 
ANY ACCUMULATIONS.  BUFKIT DATA IS SHOWING ABOUT A TENTH OF AN INCH 
OF QPF OVERNIGHT...WHICH WOULD TRANSLATE TO ABOUT AN INCH.  WARM 
GROUND FROM THE RECENT WARM SPELL SHOULD EAT AWAY AT SOME OF THE 
SNOW HOWEVER.  WILL GO WITH LESS THAN AN INCH OF ACCUMULATION.

SINCE A LOT OF THE PUBLIC HAD BEEN WORKING OUTSIDE RECENTLY WILL 
ISSUE A FROST WARNING FOR TONIGHT.  THIS WILL ALLOW MORE TIME FOR 
THE PUBLIC TO TAKE ACTION...RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL 4 PM.

SCATTERED RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUE TUESDAY AS LOW PULLS AWAY.  
COULD BE CLOSE TO SOME RECORDS TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT SINCE THAT IS 
4TH PERIODS WILL NOT MENTION RECORDS IN THE ZFP RIGHT NOW.  DONT

238 AM EDT MON APR 16 2001

MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN FORECASTING THAT COLD UPPER LOW 
CURRENTLY OVER NORTHERN MINNESOTA WILL DROP THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES 
AND INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY 48 HOURS.  

CLOUDS AND SCATTERED SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH INDIANA ARE ASSOCIATED 
WITH A SURFACE TROF. THIS FEATURES WILL SWING ACROSS THE FA THIS 
MORNING.  WILL ADD MENTION OF WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS TO THE 
NORTHERN HALF TODAY.  CLOUDS ARE A TOUGH CALL TODAY.  ETA CURU IS 
SHOWING OVC CLOUDS ALL DAY.  NGM CURU HOWEVER IS HINTING AT SOME 
DRYING WORKING IN DURING THE AFTERNOON. SINCE THE STRONGEST CAA 
DOESNT KICK IN UNTIL TONIGHT...WILL BE A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC AND WILL 
GO WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES IN THE SOUTH.

1000-850 THICKNESSES DROP BELOW 1300M QUICKLY TONIGHT.  WILL 
CONTINUE WITH MENTION OF SNOW SHOWERS NORTH AND RAIN SHOWERS TURNING 
TO SNOW SHOWERS SOUTH.  BIGGER QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT TO MENTION 
ANY ACCUMULATIONS.  BUFKIT DATA IS SHOWING ABOUT A TENTH OF AN INCH 
OF QPF OVERNIGHT...WHICH WOULD TRANSLATE TO ABOUT AN INCH.  WARM 
GROUND FROM THE RECENT WARM SPELL SHOULD EAT AWAY AT SOME OF THE 
SNOW HOWEVER.  WILL GO WITH LESS THAN AN INCH OF ACCUMULATION.

SINCE A LOT OF THE PUBLIC HAD BEEN WORKING OUTSIDE RECENTLY WILL 
ISSUE A FROST WARNING FOR TONIGHT.  THIS WILL ALLOW MORE TIME FOR 
THE PUBLIC TO TAKE ACTION...RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL 4 PM.

SCATTERED RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUE TUESDAY AS LOW PULLS AWAY.  
COULD BE CLOSE TO SOME RECORDS TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT SINCE THAT IS 
4TH PERIODS WILL NOT MENTION RECORDS IN THE ZFP RIGHT NOW.  DONT 
SEE THE CLEAR SKIES THE NGM MOS IS FORECASTING ON TUESDAY NIGHT.  
WILL GO PARTLY CLOUDY.

TREND OF TEMPERATURES HAS BEEN DOWN.  WONT STRAY TO MUCH FROM THE 
NEW MOS.

FCST IS FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD FOR THE NEXT 24 TO 36 HRS...THEN 
MODELS HAVE A HARD TIME COMING UP WITH A REASONABLE SOLUTION BEYOND 
36 HRS.

CUMULUS CLOUDS THAT DEVELOPED THIS MORNING WERE GRADUALLY 
DISSIPATING PER VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY.  AS A RESULT...SFC HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR SPRINGFIELD...IL WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO VLY 
OVERNIGHT.  RH FIELDS ARE FCST TO BE ON THE DRY SIDE FOR MOST OF THE 
NIGHT...SO A CLEAR FCST IS IN STORE ACRS MOST OF THE REGION.  CLOUDS 
WILL BE ON THE INCREASE...HOWEVER...LATE TONIGHT/TOWARD DAWN ACRS 
THE WRN CWFA AS A S/WV (NOW OVER THE NRN PLAINS) MOVES EAST.  
WAA...REFLECTED ALOFT...WILL BRING IN AN AC DECK.  THIS WILL REACH 
THE WRN AREAS BETWEEN 5 AM AND 8 AM...AND THE ERN AREAS BETWEEN 7 AM 
AND 10 AM.  WENT A LITTLE BELOW MOS GUIDANCE TONIGHT GIVEN LIGHT 
WINDS EXPECTED WITH SFC HIGH AND THE LATE APCH OF CLOUDS.

ON SATURDAY...THE WAA CLOUDS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A COLD FRONT.  THE 
MAIN DYNAMICS ASSOCD WITH THIS FRONT WILL AFFECT LOCATIONS GENERALLY 
NORTH OF OUR REGION.  MESO ETA STILL HINTS AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
FEW SPRINKLES AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  THUS...WILL CARRY AFTN SPRINKLES 
IN FOR THE DAY AND WAPAKONETA GROUPS (CLOSER TO UPR SUPPORT).  TEMPS 
WILL BE A LITTLE WARMER THAN TODAY GIVEN THE WAA AHEAD OF THE FRONT.
MOS TEMPS ARE JUST ABOUT ON TARGET.

THINGS GET COMPLICATED FOR SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  ALL MODELS 
SHOW THE COLD FRONT SAGGING SOUTH ALONG THE OHIO RIVER BY SUNDAY 
MORNING.  HOWEVER...THE ETA VS THE AVN/NGM DIFFER ON THE STRENGTH 
AND SPEED OF A S/WV EJECTING OUT OF THE SW UNITED STATES INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY.  ON ONE HAND...THE AVN DEVELOPS A DEEPER...FASTER SFC 
LOW ALONG THE FRONT...RESULTING IN A STRONGER LOW LEVEL JET.  IT HAS 
BEEN CONSISTENT WITH ITS STRONG LOW LEVEL JET...BUT I BELIEVE IT IS 
TOO STRONG.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THE ETA IS SLOWER/WEAKER WITH ITS 
SFC LOW DEVELOPMENT/LOW LEVEL JET.  IT...ALSO...HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT 
CONSISTENT.  AS A RESULT...A BLENDED COMPROMISE SEEMS THE WAY TO 
GO.  WILL INTRODUCE A CHC OF SHOWERS CVG GROUP FOR LATE SATURDAY 
NIGHT...LEAVING OTHER LOCATIONS DRY.  WILL CONTINUE A CHC OF 
SHOWERS/TSTMS FOR THE CVG AND PMH GROUPS ON SUNDAY...LEAVING THE 
REMAINDER OF THE FCST ZONES DRY.  THE REASONING FOR THIS IS THAT THE 
MEAN FLOW REMAINS WESTERLY...SO ANY PCPN THAT DEVELOPS WILL TEND TO 
MOVE EAST INSTEAD OF NORTH.  WILL ALSO GO COOLER THAN THE MOS SINCE 
FRONT IS SOUTH OF THE REGION...WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN COOLER TEMPS 
THAN WHAT MOS IS SHOWING.

.ILN...NONE.

OVERNIGHT.  RH FIELDS ARE FCST TO BE ON THE DRY SIDE FOR MOST OF THE 
NIGHT...SO A CLEAR FCST IS IN STORE ACRS MOST OF THE REGION.  CLOUDS 
WILL BE ON THE INCREASE...HOWEVER...LATE TONIGHT/TOWARD DAWN ACRS 
THE WRN CWFA AS A S/WV (NOW OVER THE NRN PLAINS) MOVES EAST.  
WAA...REFLECTED ALOFT...WILL BRING IN AN AC DECK.  THIS WILL REACH 
THE WRN AREAS BETWEEN 5 AM AND 8 AM...AND THE ERN AREAS BETWEEN 7 AM 
AND 10 AM.  WENT A LITTLE BELOW MOS GUIDANCE TONIGHT GIVEN LIGHT 
WINDS EXPECTED WITH SFC HIGH AND THE LATE APCH OF CLOUDS.

ON SATURDAY...THE WAA CLOUDS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY A COLD FRONT.  THE 
MAIN DYNAMICS ASSOCD WITH THIS FRONT WILL AFFECT LOCATIONS GENERALLY 
NORTH OF OUR REGION.  MESO ETA STILL HINTS AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
FEW SPRINKLES AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  THUS...WILL CARRY AFTN SPRINKLES 
IN FOR THE DAY AND WAPAKONETA GROUPS (CLOSER TO UPR SUPPORT).  TEMPS 
WILL BE A LITTLE WARMER THAN TODAY GIVEN THE WAA AHEAD OF THE FRONT.
MOS TEMPS ARE JUST ABOUT ON TARGET.

THINGS GET COMPLICATED FOR SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  ALL MODELS 
SHOW THE COLD FRONT SAGGING SOUTH ALONG THE OHIO RIVER BY SUNDAY 
MORNING.  HOWEVER...THE ETA VS THE AVN/NGM DIFFER ON THE STRENGTH 
AND SPEED OF A S/WV EJECTING OUT OF THE SW UNITED STATES INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY.  ON ONE HAND...THE AVN DEVELOPS A DEEPER...FASTER SFC 
LOW ALONG THE FRONT...RESULTING IN A STRONGER LOW LEVEL JET.  IT HAS 
BEEN CONSISTENT WITH ITS STRONG LOW LEVEL JET...BUT I BELIEVE IT IS 
TOO STRONG.  ON THE OTHER HAND...THE ETA IS SLOWER/WEAKER WITH ITS 
SFC LOW DEVELOPMENT/LOW LEVEL JET.  IT...ALSO...HAS BEEN SOMEWHAT 
CONSISTENT.  AS A RESULT...A BLENDED COMPROMISE SEEMS THE WAY TO 
GO.  WILL INTRODUCE A CHC OF SHOWERS CVG GROUP FOR LATE SATURDAY 
NIGHT...LEAVING OTHER LOCATIONS DRY.  WILL CONTINUE A CHC OF 
SHOWERS/TSTMS FOR THE CVG AND PMH GROUPS ON SUNDAY...LEAVING THE 
REMAINDER OF THE FCST ZONES DRY.  THE REASONING FOR THIS IS THAT THE 
MEAN FLOW REMAINS WESTERLY...SO ANY PCPN THAT DEVELOPS WILL TEND TO 
MOVE EAST INSTEAD OF NORTH.  WILL ALSO GO COOLER THAN THE MOS SINCE 
FRONT IS SOUTH OF THE REGION...WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN COOLER TEMPS 
THAN WHAT MOS IS SHOWING.

.ILN...NONE.

THE FRONT WILL SAG TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OVERNIGHT.  A S/WV...MOVING

MOSTLY CLOUDY WAPAKONETA SHOULD WORK OUT (HOWEVER...JUST N OF DAY IT

ON FRIDAY...THE UPR LVL FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL.  THE AFOREMENTIONED 
S/WV PIVOTS AWAY FROM THE REGION...ALLOWING SFC HIGH PRESSURE TO 
WEDGE IN THE WEST.  NGM/AVN ARE MUCH DRIER AT 850 MB THAN THE

SURFACE CONVERGENCE AND ON THE NORTHERN END OF THETA-E AXIS.  KILN 
IS NOT SHOWING ANY RETURNS YET HOWEVER KIND IS SHOWING A FEW.

IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTION.  CAPE VALUES 
ARE APPROACHING 2000 J/KG OVER FA WITH REALLY NO INHIBITION.  
SURFACE DELTA THETA-E VALUES ARE IN EXCESS OF 25 DEGREES.  SHEAR

JUST THE CONVERGENCE NEAR THE AFOREMENTIONED BOUNDARY ISNT ENOUGH 
TO GET IT GOING.  WILL CONTEMPLATE PUTTING IN SEVERE WORDING BEFORE 
ISSUING.

OVERNIGHT SHOULD REMAIN RELATIVELY DRY AFTER THE EVENING CONVECTION 
MOVES OFF TO THE EAST.  ANOTHER BATCH OF CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO 
FIRE OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND AFFECT NORTHERN FA MONDAY MORNING.  
HOWEVER 1000 TO 500 MB THICKNESS SUGGEST IT SHOULD TURN A BIT 
SOUTH.  LATTER SHIFTS WILL HAVE TO MONITOR TO SEE IF WORDING FOR 
SOUTHERN FA NEEDS UPDATING.  ONCE AGAIN CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO 
REFIRE IN WAKE OF MCS AS DAYTIME HEATING OCCURS.

FWC TEMPS LOOK TOO COOL WITH FA STAYING IN THE WARM SECTOR AND TDS

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVER 
OHIO AND SOUTHERN INDIANA WITH A CONVERGENT BOUNDARY JUST BEHIND THE 
SURFACE THETA-E AXIS OVER NORTHWESTERN INDIANA.  MSAS LIS ARE 
GENERALLY IN THE -4 TO -6 RANGE WITH TEMPS AROUND 80 INTO THE LOWER 
80S.

BIG QUESTION FOR FORECAST IS CONVECTION IN THE SHORT-TERM AND THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST.  MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT AVN IS A 
BIT SOUTH OF ETA LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES 36 TO 48 HOURS OUT.  ETA 
INDICATING 50+KT 850 JET NOSING INTO FA BETWEEN 21Z AND 03Z THIS 
EVENING.  AT 250 MB THERE ALSO IS SOME UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE.  THE 
ADDED CONVERGENCE FROM THE 850 JET ALONG WITH THE CONVERGENT 
BOUNDARY SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO KICK OFF CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON.  
CAPE VALUES WILL LIKELY BE IN THE 1500 TO 2000 J/KG.  BELIEVE THE 
MAIN THREAT WILL BE A SOME KIND OF A SQUALL LINE WILL DEVELOP AND 
SLIDE THROUGH FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST WITH THE MAIN THREAT BEING 
DAMAGING WIND GUSTS.  

BOUNDARY LAYER CONVERGENT BOUNDARY THEN STALLS OVER SOUTHERN FA 
OVERNIGHT KEEPING THE THREAT OF CONVECTION (MCS) OVERNIGHT.  BELIEVE 
THIS WILL BE A RAIN THREAT.  DONT PARTICULARLY FEEL THAT FLOODING 
WILL BE A PROBLEM...HOWEVER IF CONVECTION GETS FOCUSED ENOUGH ALONG 
AND NORTH OF OHIO RIVER IN SOUTHERN OHIO THEN FLOODING WILL HAVE TO 
BE MONITORED.

CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE A THREAT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AS FA 
STAYS IN THE WARM SECTOR WITH FOCUSING MECHANISMS MOVING ACROSS AND 
JUST TO OUR NORTH.

WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN FWC AND MAV NUMBERS SINCE FWC APPEARS TO 
COOL WHEN COMPARING WITH 850 AND 1000-850 THICKNESS TECHNIQUES.

240 AM EDT SAT APR 7 2001

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVER 
OHIO AND SOUTHERN INDIANA WITH A CONVERGENT BOUNDARY JUST BEHIND THE 
SURFACE THETA-E AXIS OVER NORTHWESTERN INDIANA.  MSAS LIS ARE 
GENERALLY IN THE -4 TO -6 RANGE WITH TEMPS AROUND 80 INTO THE LOWER 
80S.

BIG QUESTION FOR FORECAST IS CONVECTION IN THE SHORT-TERM AND THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST.  MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT AVN IS A 
BIT SOUTH OF ETA LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES 36 TO 48 HOURS OUT.  ETA 
INDICATING 50+KT 850 JET NOSING INTO FA BETWEEN 21Z AND 03Z THIS 
EVENING.  AT 250 MB THERE ALSO IS SOME UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE.  THE 
ADDED CONVERGENCE FROM THE 850 JET ALONG WITH THE CONVERGENT 
BOUNDARY SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO KICK OFF CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON.  
CAPE VALUES WILL LIKELY BE IN THE 1500 TO 2000 J/KG.  BELIEVE THE 
MAIN THREAT WILL BE A SOME KIND OF A SQUALL LINE WILL DEVELOP AND 
SLIDE THROUGH FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST WITH THE MAIN THREAT BEING 
DAMAGING WIND GUSTS.  

BOUNDARY LAYER CONVERGENT BOUNDARY THEN STALLS OVER SOUTHERN FA 
OVERNIGHT KEEPING THE THREAT OF CONVECTION (MCS) OVERNIGHT.  BELIEVE 
THIS WILL BE A RAIN THREAT.  DONT PARTICULARLY FEEL THAT FLOODING 
WILL BE A PROBLEM...HOWEVER IF CONVECTION GETS FOCUSED ENOUGH ALONG 
AND NORTH OF OHIO RIVER IN SOUTHERN OHIO THEN FLOODING WILL HAVE TO 
BE MONITORED.

CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE A THREAT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AS FA 
STAYS IN THE WARM SECTOR WITH FOCUSING MECHANISMS MOVING ACROSS AND 
JUST TO OUR NORTH.

WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN FWC AND MAV NUMBERS SINCE FWC APPEARS TO 
COOL WHEN COMPARING WITH 850 AND 1000-850 THICKNESS TECHNIQUES. 

MISILN WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

RADAR SHOWS A SHOWER OR TWO OVER WEST CENTRAL OHIO.  OF GREATER 
CONCERN ARE STRONG TSRA OVER NORTHERN ILLINOIS/INDIANA MOVING TOWARD 
OUR AREA NEAR SFC FRONTAL BOUNDARY...WITH SVR WATCH ISSUED IN 
INDIANA UP TO OUR CWAS WESTERN BORDER.  TSRA SHOULD HOLD TOGETHER 
AS THEY MOVE INTO OUR UNSTABLE AIRMASS.  MORE TSRA COULD ALSO 
DEVELOP SOUTH OF THE CURRENT TSRA OVER CENTRAL ILLINOIS AND 
INDIANA...AS INSOLATION HAS CAUSED GREATER INSTABILITY THERE.  WITH 
AREA UNDER SLIGHT RISK FOR SVR...HAVE ISSUED CLESPSILN HIGHLIGHTING

FOR TONIGHT...WILL GO WITH TSRA LIKELY WEST CENTRAL COUNTIES AND 
DAY...WITH HIGH CHANCE ELSEWHERE...USING MAINLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT 
WORDING IN WEST WITH FRONT LIFTING FARTHER NORTH TONIGHT.

WITH FRONT CONTINUING NORTH...TSRA CHANCE IS LESS FAVORABLE ON 
SATURDAY.  HOWEVER...WITH PERSISTENT MOIST UNSTABLE AIR NEAR SFC AND 
MID AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT...ILL KEEP 30% POPS ALL ZONES FOR 
AFTERNOON TSRA.  WITH FAVORABLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND JET

06Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A COLD FRONT LOCATED NEAR THE 
TN/KY BORDER.  A WARM FRONT WAS ALSO NOTED FROM NRN AL...INTO SW 
TN...NRN ARKANSAS...THEN INTO NE OKLA.  HIGH PRESSURE WAS CENTERED 
NEAR LAKE SUPERIOR...RIDGING INTO THE MIDDLE OHIO VALLEY.

SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING SHOWED SOME ALTOCUMULUS CLOUDS 
SPREADING SE INTO THE CWFA. MODELS HAVE SHOWN THIS...AND THESE 
CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SE THROUGH THE REGION.  BY SUNRISE...I 
EXPECT MOST OF THE CLOUDS TO BE EXITING THE REGION.  THUS...WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE...SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY TODAY.  TEMPS STILL 
DIFFICULT TO FIGURE OUT.  THE NGM TEMPS AT 850 MB HAVE TRENDED 
SLIGHTLY COOLER...THE ETA WARMER...AND THE AVN ABOUT THE SAME.  WITH 
ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND A MODIFYING AIRMASS...A BLEND OF THE NGM/AVN 
LOOKS LIKE A GOOD BET WITH A SLIGHT TREND TOWARD WARMER VALUES.

FOR TONIGHT...SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY SHIFT SOUTH AND EAST 
WHILE AN H5 UPR LVL RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO THE MID SECTION OF 
THE UNITED STATES.  MODELS SHOW HIGH LEVEL MSTR SPILLING OVER THE 
EAST SIDE OF THE UPR LVL RIDGE AXIS INTO THE REGION.  MOST OF THE 
TIME...IF THE UPR LVL RIDGE IS AMPLIFIED ENOUGH...THE CIRRUS TENDS 
TO BE THIN.  WITH THAT SAID...WILL CARRY MOSTLY CLEAR WORDING 
TONIGHT IN ANTICIPATION OF THIN CIRRUS.

ON THURSDAY...SKIES WILL BE PARTLY SUNNY DUE TO SUNSHINE FILTERING 
THROUGH HIGH LVL CLOUDINESS.  SOME AFTERNOON CUMULUS CLOUDS MAY 
DEVELOP ACRS THE SRN CWFA AS RETURN FLOW FROM THE SOUTH AT 850 MB 
BRINGS SOME MSTR NORTHWARD.  WITH 850 TEMPS MODIFYING...EXPECT TEMPS 
TO BE WARMER.  WILL TAKE A BLEND OF THE MOS/AVN...TRENDING TOWARD 
SLIGHTLY WARMER.  

BY THURSDAY NIGHT...A WARM FRONT BEGINS TO PUSH NORTH THROUGH THE 
REGION.  MESOETA SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY MODEL DEVELOPING SOME ELEVATED 
CONVECTION OVER IOWA/ILLINOIS...WHICH IF IT DEVELOPS AND HOLDS 
TOGETHER...COULD AFFECT THE WRN CWFA (DAY TO WAPAKONETA) BY FRIDAY 
MORNING.  PARTLY CLOUDY FORECAST FOR THURSDAY NIGHT LOOKS GOOD AT 
THIS TIME.  HAVE TRENDED WARMER ON THE LOWS FROM MOS AS HIGHER 
DEWPOINTS ARE EXPECTED ONCE WARM FRONT MOVES NORTH.  ALSO...SOME 
DEBRIS BLOW OFF SHOULD KEEP TEMPS WARMER.

SLOW MOVING UPPER RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL 
INFLUENCE THE AREAS WEATHER FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.  NORTHWEST 
FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE OUR DRY WEATHER. 

AT SFC...COLD FRONT THAT SHIFTED WINDS TO THE NORTH TODAY IS MOVING 
SOUTHEAST AWAY FROM HERE.  HIGH PRESSURE IS DROPPING DOWN TOWARD NEW 
YORK STATE IN NORTHWEST UPPER FLOW.  HIGH IS PROGGED TO REMAIN 
NORTHEAST OF HERE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS...WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT 
NORTH OF ROCKIES LOW STAYING ACROSS PLAINS AND WESTERN GREAT LAKES. 

SFC COLD ADVECTION IS OCCURRING NOW IN NORTH FLOW BEHIND FRONT.  
TEMPS HAVE DROPPED A DEGREE OR TWO IN THE LAST HOUR AROUND DAY AND 
CMH. COLD ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT BEFORE NEUTRALIZING ON 
WEDNESDAY.  WARM ADVECTION WILL THEN TAKE OVER ON THURSDAY AS SFC 
FLOW RETURNS TO SOUTHEAST. 

WITH PREVALENT DOWNWARD MOTION AND LITTLE MOISTURE...CLOUDS AND 
PRECIP WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  WILL GO WITH 
MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT AND MOSTLY SUNNY FOR WEDNESDAY. H5 MOISTURE IS 
PROGGED TO SPILL OVER THE RIDGE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY INTO 
OUR NORTHERN SECTIONS. WILL GO WITH PARTLY CLOUDY AT DAY AND 
CMH...MOSTLY CLEAR AT CVG FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  FOR THURSDAY... 
MOISTURE IS FCST TO MOVE BACK IN BY LATE AFTERNOON FROM 700-500MB 
MAINLY IN OUR WESTERN COUNTIES.  WILL USE MOSTLY SUNNY ALL ZONES 
...WITH INCREASING AFTERNOON CLOUDS WEST

WILL STAY CLOSE TO FWC/AVN AND ABOVE ETA THROUGH THE FCST PERIOD.  
TEMPS SHOULD COOL INTO 35-40 RANGE TONIGHT. ABUNDANT SUNSHINE SHOULD 
ALLOW READINGS TO RISE BACK NEAR WHERE THEY ARE TODAY...WHILE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER WITH CLOUDS AT H5.

LOOKING AT THE LAST KILN RADAR LOOP...IT APPEARS THE RAIN HAS

OTHERWISE...PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES NORTH...AND BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY

ACROSS.  THE CU ACROSS IL AND WESTERN INDIANA IS DIURNAL...SO EXPECT 
SKIES TO BECOME CLEAR OVERNIGHT.  DO EXPECT SOME CI TO WORK BACK

FORMING AN MCS AND SLIDING SE ALONG THE FRONT PRODUCING OVER .75

DROPPING SE NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES.  ETA AND NGM ARE MORE

A FEW SHOWERS COULD FORM IN THE SOUTHWEST MONDAY NIGHT...SO WILL

ELSEWHERE.

WARM FRONT PUSHES NORTH ON TUESDAY.  PER REASONING ABOVE...WILL 
MENTION CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE FA TUESDAY.  THINK THE 
SOUTHWEST MIGHT GET INTO THE WARM SECTOR ON TUESDAY...SO WILL ADD 
MENTION OF THUNDER.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES.  MOS WAS TRENDED WARMER TONIGHT ALL LOCATIONS. 
ALTHOUGH COULD SEE SOME PATCHY FOG AND HIGH CLOUDS...THINK THAT IT 
IS TOO WARM AND WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT FORECAST NUMBERS 
WHICH ARE IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S.  MOS CONTINUES TO SHOW 
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER TO MID 50S. THOSE NUMBERS LOOK PRETTY

DROPPING SE NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES.  ETA AND NGM ARE MORE 
CONSERVATIVE AND TRY TO KEEP SHOWERS SOUTH OF THE FRONT.  WILL 
DISCOUNT AVN SOLUTION AS IT APPEARS OVERDONE WITH THE NORTHERN 
STREAM ENERGY. HOWEVER...FEEL THAT WITH GOOD LIFT ACROSS FRONT THAT 
A FEW SHOWERS COULD FORM IN THE SOUTHWEST MONDAY NIGHT...SO WILL 
CONTINUE TO MENTION THEM.  WILL PULL OUT THE PCPN MONDAY NIGHT 
ELSEWHERE.

WARM FRONT PUSHES NORTH ON TUESDAY.  PER REASONING ABOVE...WILL 
MENTION CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE FA TUESDAY.  THINK THE 
SOUTHWEST MIGHT GET INTO THE WARM SECTOR ON TUESDAY...SO WILL ADD 
MENTION OF THUNDER.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES.  MOS WAS TRENDED WARMER TONIGHT ALL LOCATIONS. 
ALTHOUGH COULD SEE SOME PATCHY FOG AND HIGH CLOUDS...THINK THAT IT 
IS TOO WARM AND WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT FORECAST NUMBERS 
WHICH ARE IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S.  MOS CONTINUES TO SHOW 
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER TO MID 50S. THOSE NUMBERS LOOK PRETTY 
GOOD...SO JUST MIGHT TWEAK HERE OR THERE.

WITH WARM FRONT STILL TO THE SOUTH MONDAY NIGHT WILL TRIM OVERNIGHT 
LOWS DOWN TO MOS NUMBERS.

CLEMISILN OUT ASAP.

H5 FLOW HAS TURNED SOUTHWEST WITH RIDGE ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST 
WITH TROF CENTERED OVER TEXAS.  MODELS ARE KEEPING UPPER DYNAMICS 
FARTHER WEST THAN PREVIOUS RUNS.  SHORT WAVE IS CURRENTLY ENTERING 
OUR WESTERN COUNTIES.  SHORT WAVE WILL LIFT THROUGH OHIO BY 18Z 
TODAY.  ANOTHER SHORT WAVE WILL AFFECT OUR REGION LATE ON FRIDAY.

SFC PATTERN DIFFUSE WITH WEAK TROF ALONG THE OHIO VALLEY EXTENDING 
TOWARD HIGH OVER MASSACHUSETTS.  AREA UNDER SOUTHERLY FLOW WITH WARM 
ADVECTION AND DRY DEWPOINTS WHERE IT IS NOT RAINING.  

OBS/RADAR SHOW LIGHT RAIN THAT IS DRIVEN BY NARROW BAND OF 
ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF FIRST SHORT WAVE FROM CVG TO DAY.  RAIN 
SHOULD END AT CVG AND DAY BY 6 AM...AND AT CMH BY MID MORNING AS 
SHORT WAVE PASSES THROUGH. 

WILL GO WITH EARLY THIS MORNING PERIOD WITH LIGHT RAIN...THEN MOSTLY 
CLOUDY WEST...RAIN ENDING MID MORNING EAST.  MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS 
ARE LACKING FOR TONIGHT WRT PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS.  WILL PULL POPS ALL 
ZONES.  WITH PVA AND MOISTURE ADVANCING SLOWLY NORTH...ILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS IN THE SOUTH LATE ON FRIDAY...WHILE REMOVING POPS IN THE 
NORTH.  WITH SFC LOW PROGGED OVER WEST VIRGINIA CARRYING A GOOD SHOT 
OF MOISTURE...WILL ADJUST FRIDAY NIGHT FROM MOSTLY CLOUDY TO RAIN 
LIKELY SOUTH/CHANCE RAIN NORTH.

FWC TEMPS STILL LOOK OK.  TODAYS 48 AT DAY LOOKS TOO LOW BUT 51 AT 
CVG AND CMH APPEAR ABOUT RIGHT.  NIGHTTIME LOWS ARE A BIT TOO LOW 
AGAIN WITH CLOUDS AND WIND EXPECTED...SO ILL GO A COUPLE DEGREES

IMPRESSIVE DRY LAYER NOTED FROM 650 TO 700MB THIS PM, AND AGAIN AT 
THE SFC WITH A EXPANSIVE AREA OF DEWPOINTS IN THE TEENS. IT SHOULD 
TAKE SOME TIME ERODING THIS DRY AIR TO PRODUCE PRECIPITATION ACROSS 
FCST AREA, BUT THINK THAT IT WILL HAPPEN EVENTUALLY. MAIN CONCERN 
RIGHT NOW IS THE MENTION OF SNOW IN THE NORTH. MODEL SOUNDINGS AND 
THICKNESSES INDICATE A CHANCE OF MIXING FOR A PERIOD, IF NOT 
STARTING AS JUST SNOW IN THE FAR NORTH. WILL HOLD ON TO PREVIOUS 
WORDING AS IT ONLY INDICATED THE POSSIBILITY.

RAIN MAY BE TOO STRONG OF A WORD FOR WHATS COMING DOWN THE LINE, 
AND ILL PROBABLY SWITCH TO LIGHT RAIN ALONG WITH SPRINKLES IN THE 
NORTH WHERE IT WILL BE A LITTLE TOUGHER TO OVERCOME THE DRY AIR 
WITH A LITTLE LESS FORCING.

LOW TEMPS WERE RUNNING ON UNTIL I NOTICED IT WAS 39 HERE AT ILN.

THE BETTER POPS ACROSS THE SOUTH CLOSER TO THE LOWER AND MID LEVEL

ACROSS THE SOUTH.  AFTER THE LOW PASSES...SURFACE RIDGING WILL KEEP

UPPER TROF STILL IN CONTROL OVER OHIO VALLEY TODAY.  MODELS IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT IN BRINGING RIDGE AXIS TO ILN AT 12Z WEDNESDAY.  AFTER 
RIDGE EXITS EAST...SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL INCREASE MOISTURE SOMEWHAT BY 
THURSDAY.

HIGH PRESSURE IS MOVING THROUGH THE AREA TODAY...TO THE VIRGINIA 
COAST BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.  PLENTY OF MOISTURE AT 850 MB IS 
HANGING AROUND IN NORTHWEST FLOW OF LAKE MICHIGAN AS SHOWN BY THE 
CLOUDS OVER MOST OF OUR AREA.  MODELS SHOW MOISTURE PERSISTING AT 
850 MB INTO TONIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY...WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS 
SHOWING ENOUGH INSTABILITY BELOW INVERSION TO SUSTAIN CLOUDS TODAY.

RADAR/OBS CURRENTLY SHOWING NO SNOW.  WITH PVA AND 850 MB 
MOISTURE...CANT RULE OUT FLURRIES.  WILL REMOVE POPS FROM TODAY 
PERIOD...BUT KEEP CHANCE FLURRIES ALL ZONES ALONG WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES.  WITH UPPER RIDGE CANCELING CYCLONIC FLOW TONIGHT AND 850 MB 
MOISTURE DECREASING IN BACKING FLOW...WILL GO WITH BECOMING PARTLY 
CLOUDY.  

MOISTURE BEGINS TO RETURN FROM 500-300 MB LATER ON WEDNESDAY AS FLOW 
BECOMES SOUTHWEST.  WILL FORECAST MOSTLY SUNNY IN THE MORNING/PARTLY 
SUNNY IN THE AFTERNOON AS I EXPECT SUNSHINE TO FADE BEHIND HIGH 
CLOUDS.

FWC TEMPS LOOK TOO WARM FOR DAYTIME PERIODS...BUT FAIRLY CLOSE FOR 
NIGHTTIME LOWS.  WILL STAY CLOSER TO PREVIOUS FCST WITH MID TO UPPER 
30S FOR TODAYS HIGHS.  LOWER 20S LOOK GOOD FOR TONIGHT WITH 
CLEARING SKIES ALLOWING GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING.  LOTS OF VARIATION 
BETWEEN MESOETA AND FWC/MAV ON WEDNESDAY...WITH MESOETA GIVING 39-43 
FOR HIGHS CONTRASTING WITH 50-55 ON THE FWC.  WILL STAY BELOW FWC

COLD POOL OF AIR ALOFT HAS ALLOWED FOR WIDESPREAD CUMULUS/MODERATE 
CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT.  ALSO...WATER VAPOR INDICATED A WK S/WV 
PIVOTING INTO THE NRN CWFA ATTM.  KILN RADAR AND SFC OBSERVATIONS 
WERE SHOWING SCATTERED FLURRIES ACRS THE REGION.

TONIGHT/S SKY AND TEMPERATURE FCST WILL BE A TRICKY ONE.  
AFOREMENTIONED S/WV WILL PASS TO THE SE DURING THE EVENING HOURS.  
CONVECTIVELY DEVELOPED CUMULUS SHOULD DECREASE IN COVERAGE SOMEWHAT 
ONCE THE SUN GOES DOWN.  HOWEVER...AS THE LOWER PART OF THE CLOUD 
DISSIPATES...THE TOPS OF THE CLOUDS SHOULD REMAIN (UNDER AN 
INVERSION ALOFT).  THE BIG QUESTION IS:  HOW MUCH?  FOR NOW...PARTLY 
CLOUDY FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT SEEMS REASONABLE (AND THIS WILL ALLOW 
THE EVENING SHIFT TO ASSESS HOW MUCH CLEARING HAS TAKEN PLACE).  
FLURRIES MAY LAST INTO THE EARLY EVENING AND WILL MONITOR THIS 
BEFORE ZONE RELEASE.  ANOTHER S/WV IS POISED TO DROP SOUTH AND EAST 
FROM THE NRN GREAT LAKES INTO THE REGION BY LATE TONIGHT.  THIS 
SYSTEM DOES NOT SHOW MUCH LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE/VERTICAL MOTION.  IT 
DOES...ON THE OTHER HAND...DEPICT SOME PVA.  THIS PVA MAYBE ENOUGH 
TO GENERATE SOME SNOW SHOWERS ACRS THE NORTH LATE TONIGHT...AND 
POSSIBLY SOME FLURRIES ACRS THE SOUTH BY MORNING.  WILL LEAN MORE 
TOWARD THE MAV NUMBERS OVERNIGHT IN HOPES THAT A FEW BREAKS WILL 
OCCUR BEFORE THE S/WV MOVES IN LATE TONIGHT.

FOR TUESDAY...COLD POOL BEGINS TO SHIFT SLOWLY EAST ALONG WITH 
S/WV.  A FEW MORNING FLURRIES/SNOW SHOWERS MAY OCCUR.  OTHERWISE 
...PARTLY CLOUDY WEST/MOSTLY CLOUDY EAST LOOKS GOOD.  WILL SHADE A 
COUPLE OF DEGREES FROM MOS/MAV GUIDANCE.

BY TUESDAY NIGHT...S/WV RIDGING ALOFT ALONG WITH SFC HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL ALLOW SKIES TO CLEAR.  BELIEVE MOS VALUES ARE TO WARM...AND 
WILL SHAVE THESE VALUES BY AT LEAST A CATEGORY.

ON WEDNESDAY...HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS BEGINS TO ENCROACH THE CWFA.  
INCREASING CLOUDS STILL SEEMS APPROPRIATE.  MOS/MAV BOTH WARM 
TEMPERATURES MUCH MORE THAN WHAT ETA THICKNESS SCHEMES ARE SHOWING 
(BY AT LEAST 10 DEGREES).  SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST RUN OF THE ETA TO 
EXTEND INTO WEDNESDAY...AM NOT 100 PERCENT CONFIDENT TO GO AS COLD 
AS THE ETA.  HOWEVER...MOS/MAV MAY BE TRYING TO WARM THE 
TEMPERATURES TOO FAST.  PLAN ON SHAVING MOS/MAV HIGHS AT LEAST BY 4 
OR 5 DEGREES.

NEXT CHANCE FOR PCPN APPEARS TO BE THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT AS A

HAS BEEN A DRY WINTER...SO SOME RAINFALL WOULD BE NICE.

AIR THAT COMES IN ON SATURDAY...WILL STILL GO WITH AROUND A 5 DEGREE 
DIURNAL AND MENTION STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING TEMPERATURES. CLOUD 
COVER SHOULD BE SIGNIFICANT AND DAYTIME HIGHS WILL BE HARD TO

PREVIOUS FCST IS RUNNING ON IN THE FIRST COUPLE OF PERIODS AND DO 
NOT EXPECT TO CHANGE TOO MUCH HERE...THOUGH ILL HAVE A GOOFY 
BREAKDOWN OF THE ZONES TO TRY TO ACCOUNT FOR TIMING OF FRONT AND 
PRECIPITATION ALONG WITH LEFTOVER MORNING WX IN THE EAST/SOUTHEAST. 

WITH REGARD TO LOW TEMPS IN THE 3RD AND 4TH PERIODS...WENT AROUND 20 
YESTERDAY FOR ALL AREAS...AND WILL HOLD THIS THINKING FOR THE MOMENT 
WITH CLEARING SKIES IN THE NIGHTTIME HOURS BOTH PERIODS. AS FOR 
DAYTIME...COLD POOL IS SIGNIFICANT AND LAPSE RATES AT 1000-850 ARE 
FROM +8 TO +10 WITH DECENT INSTABILITY NOTED IN ALL AREAS BETWEEN 
H925 AND H850/800. THIS DOESNT SHOW UP WELL ON MODELS AS THEY ARE 
CALCULATING INSTABILITY THROUGH H5. AM THINKING OF MOCLOUDY FOR NEXT 
TWO, MAYBE THREE, DAYTIME PERIODS ALONG WITH CHANCE FOR SNOW SHOWERS 
IN THE NORTH AND FLURRIES IN THE SOUTH. NO ACCUMULATIONS.

H5 TROF ROTATES THROUGH ERN GREAT LAKES OVERNIGHT SUNDAY THOUGH FLOW 
REMAINS NORTHWEST. A THIN BUT SIGNIFICANT DRY LAYER ASSOCIATED WITH 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS NOTED IN THE SOUTHWEST AND WILL WORD AS 
PARTLY CLOUDY FOR MONDAY...THOUGH THE CONTINUED NW FLOW SHOULD BRING 
MOCLOUDY SKIES AND CHANCE OF -SHSN TO THE NORTHEAST.

EXTENDED FCST IS DIFFICULT. PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS HAD SOME PRECIP 
POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT TUE IN THE SOUTH BUT NEW AVN IS SUGGESTING A 
LATER ARRIVAL. TRENDS THIS SEASON SEEM TO BE FOR MODELS TO PUSH 
PRECIP IN EARLY AND ACTUALLY HAVE THE EVENT ARRIVE LATE. WILL REMOVE

LOOKS LIKE AN ARCTIC AIRMASS TO ENTER THE REGION ON SATURDAY. 

PC/MOCLEAR SKIES SHOULD BE IN STORE THROUGH FRIDAY PM...AS 
INCREASING CLOUDS/MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH NEG TILTING H5 LOW JUST N 
OF LK SUPERIOR PUSHES THROUGH OVERNIGHT...ALONG WITH SFC CDFNT. I 
IMAGINE THAT IT SHOULD BE A RELATIVELY SHORT PERIOD WHERE PRECIP IS 
POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT FRIDAY AND WILL GO WITH RAIN. COLDEST AIR IS 
ALOFT AND SFC WONT COOL OFF UNTIL DAWN/EARLY SATURDAY. WILL MENTION 
EARLY HIGHS WITH STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS DURING THE DAY.

INITIAL THOUGHTS FOR SAT WERE PTCLDY WITH LESS OF A CHANCE FOR 
PRECIP...BUT SECOND THINKING TELLS ME THAT THAT COLD OF AN AMS OVER 
THE REGION AND WARMER SFC AIR EARLY IN THE DAY COULD BRING SOME 
CONVECTIVE MIXING. WILL WORD SAT WITH VARIABLY CLOUDY AND KEEP LOW 
CHANCE POPS OF SNOW SHOWERS IN ALL ZONES. 

SUNDAY AM TEMPS COULD BE QUITE TRICKY...CURRENTLY RUNNING LOWER 
20S...WILL DROP TO AROUND 20 FOR MOST AREAS AS AVN IS SHOWING COLDEST
POOL OF SFC AIR AT CVG/SDF IN THE MID TEENS. ETA DOESNT GO OUT THIS 
FAR...BUT WAS SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN AVN FROM H48-60 AT SFC...WHICH 
LETS ME BELIEVE THAT AVN COULD BE ON THE $. LOOKING AT RECORDS FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR...PREVIOUS COLD SNAPS HAVE PUSHED LOWS TO THE 
LOWER AND MIDDLE TEENS ACROSS FCST AREA SO THESE TEMPS ARE 
DEFINITELY WITHIN THE REALM OF POSSIBILITY CLIMATALOGICALLY SPEAKING.

WILL LIMIT CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS ON SUNDAY TO JUST THE NORTH AS H5 
LOW OVER ERN GTLKS ROTATES THROUGH AND AXIS OF H8 COLD POOL 
APPROACHES REGION.

REST OF EXTENDED FCST LOOKS PC/MOCLEAR WITH A GRADUAL WARMUP. NEXT 
SYSTEM STARTS TO SPIN UP IN CENTRAL PLAINS AHEAD OF DIGGING H5 TROF

AM HAVING A HARD TIME UNDERSTANDING MODEL SOLUTIONS TONIGHT. 
CONFIDENCE DECREASES EXPONENTIALLY WITH TIME. 24 HOURS AGO HAD SPLIT 
SYSTEMS MERGING IN SRN GT LKS REGION. NOW THE SPLIT SYSTEMS DONT 
MERGE ALTHOUGH ENERGY FROM SRN S/W DOES GET PULLED INTO NRN SYSTEM 
TO ENHANCE SFC LOW OVER ILL.

ONLY SAVING GRACE RIGHT NOW IS THAT THE MODELS ARE TRENDING TO A 
SOLUTION...BUT ARE STILL OFF BY A COUPLE HUNDRED KM ON SFC FEATURES 
IN LATTER PERIODS. WILL DEFER TO NCEP FOLKS AND TAKE THEIR ADVICE 
USING THE ETA AS MODEL OF CHOICE.

IN THE HERE AND NOW...SOME LOWER CLOUDS NOTED ON SAT IMAGE COOINCIDE 
WITH H9 80% LINE. THIS GETS SHIFTED TO ERN AND NRN FCST AREA BY 12Z 
AND WILL GO WITH SOME MORNING CLOUDS IN THESE AREAS. OTHERWISE... 
SUBSIDENCE AND REALTIVELY DRY AIR IN LOWER LEVELS SHOULD PROVIDE FOR 
A MOSUNNY DAY ACROSS OH VLY. GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE RELATIVELY CLOSE 
BETWEEN THE FWC/FAN/MAV...AND WILL TAKE THE HIGHER END OF THESE 
NUMBERS FOR HIGHS TODAY. EXPECT AN INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS 
OVERNIGHT...WHICH MAY OR MAY NOT HOLD TEMPERATURES UP IN THE EAST. 
PREVIOUS FCST HAS 40 POPS IN WRN ZONES WITH LATE WORDING. WILL HOLD 
ON TO THIS AS ITS ENTIRELY REASONABLE...BUT BRING POPS DOWN 10% 
ACROSS THE BOARD AND THROW 20 POPS IN SOUTHEAST GROUP DUE TO THE 
SPLIT SYSTEMS APPROACHING FROM W AND SW.

RAINY THURSDAY NOTED IN ZONES. NO PROBLEMS HERE...BUT WILL CUT 80 
POPS OVER NE FCST AREA TO LIKELY. CONTAMINATION BETWEEN 2 SFC LOWS 
SHOWS PRECIP OVER ENTIRE REGION...BUT ETA SUGGESTING AT A WEDGE OF 
NO PRECIP FROM NE OH TO N CNTL OH DURING THE DAY. NE FLOW OVER 
REGION AT THIS TIME IS DOWNSLOPING AND THIS LOOKS REASONABLE. 

BY FRIDAY MY CONFIDENCE IN MODELS IS IN A TAIL SPIN...WILL KEEP 
PREVIOUS FCST ALTHOUGH CURRENT MODEL SOLUTION WOULD SUGGEST A RAIN 
CHANGING TO SNOW EVENT AS OPPOSED TO JUST SNOW.

MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT AS THEY LIFT UPPER LOW OUT OF THE GREAT 
PLAINS.  SURFACE LOW LIFTS THROUGH THE NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
INTO THE GREAT LAKES.

THREE DIFFERENT VORT MAXS AFFECT THE FA THIS FORECAST PACKAGE.  
FIRST LIFTS ACROSS THE FA THIS AFTERNOON IN WAA AHEAD OF THE SURFACE 
LOW.  SECOND SWINGS THROUGH AROUND 12Z TUESDAY WITH COLD FRONT.  
THIRD DROPS DOWN IN NORTHWEST FLOW THROUGH KY AROUND 00Z WED.

GOOD ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE FA TODAY...BUT SOME OF IT WILL BE 
USED TO MOISTEN THE ATMOSPHERE.  STILL LOOKS LIKE MAINLY AN 
AFTERNOON EVENT.  CURRENT POPS AND WORDING HAVE THIS COVERED WELL 
WILL PUSH POPS INTO THE CATEGORICAL RANGE OVER NIGHT.  FEEL THAT 
ALMOST EVERY ONE WILL SEE SOME RAIN TONIGHT.  ALTHOUGH NEW SWODY1 
HAS ENTIRE FA IN GENERAL THUNDER....WILL CONTINUE TO ONLY CARRY IT 
IN THE SOUTH.  THIS IS WHERE THE BEST DEWPOINTS WILL BE AND LOWEST 
LI.

COLD AIR SEEMS TO TAKE LONGER TO GET IN THIS RUN...SO WILL KEEP THE 
PCPN ALL RAIN DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY.  WILL THEN MAKE THE CHANGE 
OVER MONDAY NIGHT.

A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO THE TEMPERATURES...OTHERWISE CURRENT FORECAST

LEFTOVER WX MAY BE NEEDED IN THE EAST EARLY THIS MORNING...WILL WAIT 
AND SEE IF PROGRESSION OF COLD FRONT IS AS QUICK AS MODELS ARE 
SUGGESTING. 

COLD POOL HANGS ON BEHIND FROPA TODAY, AND AXIS OF MOISTURE IS 
LOCATED JUST N OF VORT MAX SWINGING THROUGH SRN FCST AREA THIS PM. 
THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO SPARK A FEW AFTERNOON SHOWERS, AND IM A 
LITTLE WORRIED FOR SE FCST AREA THIS PM WITH 50 KT H8 JET PROGGED TO 
BE THERE AT 0Z. ANY SHOWERS AHEAD OF JET MAY BRING A FEW GUSTS TO 40 
OR SO. WILL HOLD ON TO BRISK WORDING WITH GUSTY 15 TO 25 MPH WINDS 
TODAY...AND BE AWARE THAT IT MAY INCREASE WITH HIGHER GUSTS IN PM. 

AFTER SCATTERED SHOWERS TODAY, SFC RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST AND WINDS SHUT OFF LATE TONIGHT. TEMP GUIDANCE S ARE 
WITHIN 2-3 DEGREES FOR THE NEXT 4 TO 5 PERIODS AND WILL STAY CLOSE 
HERE.

NEXT SHOT OF PRECIP IS WITH A MERGING SW AND NW SYSTEM OVER FCST 
AREA ON THURSDAY. DONT BELIEVE THAT THIS SCENARIO WILL PLAY OUT 
WITH THEM MERGING OVER THE GT LKS...BUT WILL DEFINITELY INDICATE 
SHOWERS FOR THURSDAY WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY DRY.

HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ACROSS SOUTHERN IN ATTM WILL SLIDE EAST TODAY 
AND SHOULD PROVIDE SUNNY SKIES FOR THE FA TODAY.  CURRENT FORECAST 
FOR TODAY HIGHS ARE MATCHING TEMPERATURES TECHNIQUES AND MOS...WHICH 
HAS BEEN TRENDING DOWNWARD...SO NO CHANGES THERE.

COLD FRONT CURRENTLY SOUTH OF LAKE WINNIPEG...DROPS INTO NORTHWEST 
OHIO BY 12Z SUNDAY.  BEST UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS SWING NORTH OF THE 
FA...WITH 500 MB VORT SLIDING ACROSS MICHIGAN. WEAK 300 MB 
DIVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH RIGHT REAR QUAD OF JET DOES AFFECT THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF OHIO BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z SUNDAY.  ETA CONTINUES TO 
BE THE MOST AGGRESSIVE WITH THE QPF...ALTHOUGH THIS TIME THE AVN IS 
SUGGESTING THAT SOME QPF MIGHT MAKE IT AS FAR SOUTH AS I-70.  I WAS 
TOO AGGRESSIVE LAST NIGHT WITH THE PRECIP FROM THIS FRONT.  WILL 
CARRY A 20 POP IN DAY AND CMH TONIGHT...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO ONLY 
MENTION POPS IN THE ZFP ACROSS THE EXTREME NORTHERN COUNTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE FRONT SITS ACROSS THE FA ON SUNDAY...ALL UPPER SUPPORTS 
QUICKLY PULLS AWAY. PRECIP ALSO SEEMS TO PULL OUT QUICKLY ON 
SUNDAY...SO DONT PLAN ON CARRYING POPS IN THE NORTH.  THERE IS GOOD 
DOWNWARD MOTION BEHIND THE FRONT ALONG WITH DRY AIR...SO WILL

FA...WITH 500 MB VORT SLIDING ACROSS MICHIGAN. WEAK 300 MB 
DIVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH RIGHT REAR QUAD OF JET DOES AFFECT THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF OHIO BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z SUNDAY.  ETA CONTINUES TO 
BE THE MOST AGGRESSIVE WITH THE QPF...ALTHOUGH THIS TIME THE AVN IS 
SUGGESTING THAT SOME QPF MIGHT MAKE IT AS FAR SOUTH AS I-70.  I WAS 
TOO AGGRESSIVE LAST NIGHT WITH THE PRECIP FROM THIS FRONT.  WILL 
CARRY A 20 POP IN DAY AND CMH TONIGHT...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO ONLY 
MENTION POPS IN THE ZFP ACROSS THE EXTREME NORTHERN COUNTIES.

ALTHOUGH THE FRONT SITS ACROSS THE FA ON SUNDAY...ALL UPPER SUPPORTS 
QUICKLY PULLS AWAY. PRECIP ALSO SEEMS TO PULL OUT QUICKLY ON 
SUNDAY...SO DONT PLAN ON CARRYING POPS IN THE NORTH.  THERE IS GOOD 
DOWNWARD MOTION BEHIND THE FRONT ALONG WITH DRY AIR...SO WILL 
MENTION PARTLY CLOUDY FOR SUNDAY...DESPITE THE LOCATION OF THE 
FRONT.  WITH COOLER AIR OVER THE NORTHERN SECTIONS...WILL DROP 
TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO MOS NUMBERS SUNDAY. 50-55 STILL LOOKS OKAY IN 
THE SOUTH.

CLEMISILN OUT LATER.

SKIES SHOULD BE SLOW TO CLEAR THIS EVENING...ESPECIALLY IN THE 
EAST.  WITH HIGH PRESSURE MOVING INTO THE REGION AT THE SFC AND 
ALOFT...ANTICYCLONIC MOTION SHOULD ALLOW FOR CLOUD DISSIPATION FROM 
WEST TO EAST.  SOME OF THE CLOUDS MAY GET TRAPPED UNDER AN INVERSION 
(ESPECIALLY EAST) AS INDICATED BY MODEL SOUNDINGS...BUT STILL 
CONFIDENT CLEARING WILL COMMENCE IN THOSE AREAS AFTER MIDNIGHT.
THUS...WILL KEEP GRADUAL CLEARING WEST AND MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH 
GRADUAL CLEARING AFTER MIDNIGHT EAST.  WILL TAKE A LOOK AT THE RADAR 
BEFORE ISSUANCE TO SEE WHICH AREAS MAY NEED AN EVENING FLURRY 
WORDING.

WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION ON SATURDAY...SKIES WILL BE 
MOSTLY SUNNY TO SUNNY.  THICKNESS SCHEMES STILL INDICATE THAT MOS 
MAY STILL BE ON THE WARM SIDE.  AS A RESULT...WILL GO CLOSER TO THE 
AVN MAV VALUES.

CANADA WILL MOVE ACRS THE GREAT LAKES.  THE AVN KEEPS THIS SYSTEM A 
LITTLE STRONGER THAN THE ETA (THE ETA TENDS TO SHEAR THE SYSTEM 
APART).  OVERALL...THE STRONGER DYNAMICS REMAIN NORTH OF OUR CWFA.  
AS THE COLD FRONT SWINGS ACRS NRN OHIO BY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...A 
FEW RENEGADE SHOWERS MAY SKIM THE NRN CWFA.  WILL INTRODUCE A SMALL 
POP THERE LATE.

ON SUNDAY...THE COLD FRONT STALLS ACRS THE NRN CWFA AS THE 
AFOREMENTIONED S/WV MOVES AWAY FROM THE SFC FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  A FEW 
SHOWERS MAY LINGER IN THE NORTH...ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING.  
OTHERWISE MOSTLY CLOUDY NORTH TO PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS ACRS THE

THANKS TO CLE FOR COORDINATION.

AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE COMING OFF OF GT 
LKS RGN WITH PASSAGE OF H5 LOW AND INVERTED SFC TROF TONIGHT. LOOKS 
LIKE THE DYNAMICS SHUT OFF SHORTLY AFT 6Z...AND ONLY A LINGERING 
SHOWER SHOULD BE EXPECTED IN ERN FCST AREA. PWATS ACROSS THE REGION 
RANGE FROM .12 AND .13 AT APX/DTW/GRB TO .20-.25 DVN/ILX/ILN AT 12Z 
TODAY. 

DWPTS NW OF FCST AREA ARE IN SINGLE DIGITS ATTM...AND EXPECT DRIER 
AIR TO INFILTRATE CWA THIS EVENING AS FLOW SHIFTS TO THE WEST WITH 
INVERTED TROF TO THE NORTH OF FCST AREA. THIS WOULD ALSO CUT LOW 
TEMPS TONIGHT...AND H925 FCST DWPTS FROM ETA ARE ALSO AROUND THE 
10-15 DEGREE RANGE.

WILL CUT SNOWFALL AMOUNTS TONIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD TO AROUND AN INCH 
CMH GROUPING...AND KEEP REST OF FCST AREA UNDER AN INCH OR EVEN 
LITTLE TO NO ACCUM FOR CVG AREA. 

ASIDE FROM SNOW CHANCES/AMOUNTS TONIGHT...WILL KEEP TEMPS ON COOLER 
SIDE WITH GOOD NORTHWEST FLOW THROUGH TUES PM. WRN AND SRN AREAS 
SHOULD WARM UP A BIT ON WED WITH SOME CLEARING EXPECTED...BUT WILL 
KEEP CMH ZONES ON COOL SIDE AS H8 RH DOESNT REALLY CLEAR OUT 
THROUGH FCST PERIOD.

NEXT SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT MAY BEGIN TO HIT SRN FCST AREA ON 
THURS...AND PREVIOUS FCST HAS THIS IN HAND. WILL NOT MESS AROUND TOO

THANKS TO CLE FOR COORDINATION.

AM NOT IMPRESSED WITH AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE COMING OFF OF GT 
LKS RGN WITH PASSAGE OF H5 LOW AND INVERTED SFC TROF TONIGHT. LOOKS 
LIKE THE DYNAMICS SHUT OFF SHORTLY AFT 6Z...AND ONLY A LINGERING 
SHOWER SHOULD BE EXPECTED IN ERN FCST AREA. PWATS ACROSS THE REGION 
RANGE FROM .12 AND .13 AT APX/DTW/GRB TO .20-.25 DVN/ILX/ILN AT 12Z 
TODAY. 

DWPTS NW OF FCST AREA ARE IN SINGLE DIGITS ATTM...AND EXPECT DRIER 
AIR TO INFILTRATE CWA THIS EVENING AS FLOW SHIFTS TO THE WEST WITH 
INVERTED TROF TO THE NORTH OF FCST AREA. THIS WOULD ALSO CUT LOW 
TEMPS TONIGHT...AND H925 FCST DWPTS FROM ETA ARE ALSO AROUND THE 
10-15 DEGREE RANGE.

WILL CUT SNOWFALL AMOUNTS TONIGHT ACROSS THE BOARD TO AROUND AN INCH 
CMH GROUPING...AND KEEP REST OF FCST AREA UNDER AN INCH OR EVEN 
LITTLE TO NO ACCUM FOR CVG AREA. 

ASIDE FROM SNOW CHANCES/AMOUNTS TONIGHT...WILL KEEP TEMPS ON COOLER 
SIDE WITH GOOD NORTHWEST FLOW THROUGH TUES PM. WRN AND SRN AREAS 
SHOULD WARM UP A BIT ON WED WITH SOME CLEARING EXPECTED...BUT WILL 
KEEP CMH ZONES ON COOL SIDE AS H8 RH DOESNT REALLY CLEAR OUT 
THROUGH FCST PERIOD.

NEXT SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT MAY BEGIN TO HIT SRN FCST AREA ON 
THURS...AND PREVIOUS FCST HAS THIS IN HAND. WILL NOT MESS AROUND TOO 
MUCH WITH EXTENDED...BUT LOOKS LIKE A SIMILAR SFC LOW COMING OUT OF 
THE SOUTH BEING SPUN UP WITH A LOBE OF THE H5 LOW FOR THE WEEKEND.

SURFACE LOW JUST TO THE EAST OF JKL AND DEEPENING.

AGREEMENT WITH POSITION.  AS THE LOW DEEPENS AND TRANSFERS ENERGY TO 
THE EAST COAST TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO DROP RAPIDLY OVER FA.  
THIS COULD BRING A SWITCH OVER FROM RAIN TO SNOW AS PRECIPITATION 
ENDS.  AFTER PRECIP ENDS FA WILL BE IN A UPPER RIDGE IN BETWEEN BIG 
POLAR VORTEX LOW AND UPPER LOW EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS.  THIS WILL 
BRING AN END TO THE PRECIP UNTIL UPPER LOW MOVES OVER REGION 
MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT.  WE WILL PROBABLY EVEN SEE A FEW PEAKS OF SUN

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING CLOUDS HAD DISSIPATED ACROSS THE FA.  
CLOUDS HOWEVER WHERE BEGINNING TO STREAM IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST AS 
THE LOW BEGINS TO DEEPEN AND ORGANIZE ALONG THE GULF COAST.

FORECAST A TOUGH ONE TODAY.  ALL 3 MODELS ARE ALL IN VERY CLOSE 
AGREEMENT.  THEY HOWEVER HAVE BEEN TRENDING WEST AND NORTH WITH BOTH 
UPPER POLAR LOW AND DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW.  THE AVN HAS BEEN IN 
GENERAL MORE CONSISTENT...BUT STILL SHOWS THIS TREND OVER THE PAST 3 
RUNS.  CONCERNED THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT RUN AND 
BRING THE HEAVIER PRECIP FARTHER INTO OH/IN.  ALSO CONCERNED THAT 
LOW IS NOT PROGGED DEEP ENOUGH AS THE UPPER LOW IS WELL TO THE 
NORTHWEST OF LOW.  THIS COULD MEAN COLDER NORTH/NORTHEASTERLY FLOW 
GETS PULLED IN CLOSER TO LOW AND TURNS RAIN OVER TO SNOW RATHER 
QUICKLY.  AT THE MOMENT IT APPEARS THAT PRECIPITATION COMES TO AN 
END AS THE COLD AIR WORKS IN.  HOWEVER LOOKING AT PROGGED SOUNDING 
FROM BUFKIT AND WEATHER MAGIC IT LOOKS LIKE FREEZING LEVEL WILL BE 
AWFULLY CLOSE TO THE GROUND BY AFTERNOON (I.E. < 2KFT).  THIS MAY 
CAUSE ANY MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN TO BRING THE FREEZING LEVEL TO THE 
GROUND PREMATURELY.  WITH ALL THIS SAID WILL GO WITH RAIN ACROSS THE 
FAR SOUTH UNTIL SUNDAY EVENING WHEN RAIN SHOULD QUICKLY TURN TO SNOW 
(HOPEFULLY NOT BEFORE).  THE CHANGE OVER WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL SECTIONS DURING THE AFTERNOON.  HOWEVER AS THINGS STAND 
DONT FEEL THINK THERE WILL BE AN ACCUMULATION.  WILL KEEP FAR NORTH 
DRY FOR THE MOMENT UNTIL UPPER LOW WORKS ACROSS SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY.

FWC/MAV IN VERY CLOSE AGREEMENT AND LINE UP WELL WITH LOCAL

MODELS ARE IN SIMILAR AGREEMENT THRU ABOUT 12Z FRIDAY...THEN THEY 
DIVERGE ON A DIFFERENT SOLUTION CONCERNING A DEVELOPING SFC LOW OVR 
THE ERN GREAT LAKES.

FOR TODAY....THE REGION REMAINS IN A CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT WITH SFC 
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUING.  HARD TO DETERMINE PARTLY SUNNY VS MOSTLY 
SUNNY FCST GIVEN THE SPLIT NATURE OF THE FLOW NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE 
OHIO VALLEY.  HOWEVER...HAVE DECIDED THAT THE SRN CWFA WILL MOSTLY 
LIKELY HAVE PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AS THEY ARE CLOSER TO THE PATH 
OF THE HIGH CLOUDS SPILLING FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS.  THE NRN CWFA 
SHOULD JUST SEE PATCHES OF HIGH CLOUDS...SO WILL GO MOSTLY SUNNY 
HERE.  MOS HAS BEEN HARD TO BEAT THESE LAST FEW DAYS.  HAVE POURED 
OVER ALLOW AVAILABLE METHODS (THICKNESS, SOUNDINGS ETC.)...AND THEY 
ALL INDICATED JUST ABOUT WHAT MOS IS SHOWING.  

FOR TONIGHT...A S/WV CURRENTLY ACRS ERN CO AND WRN KS WILL MOVE EAST 
INTO THE CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT.  THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN 850 MB 
MSTR...BUT GIVEN THE LACK OF LOW LVL FORCING...ONLY VIRGA IS 
EXPECTED ATTM.  THUS...WILL LEAVE FCST DRY. LOW TEMPS AROUND 30 OR

MODELS ARE IN SIMILAR AGREEMENT THRU ABOUT 12Z FRIDAY...THEN THEY 
DIVERGE ON A DIFFERENT SOLUTION CONCERNING A DEVELOPING SFC LOW OVR 
THE ERN GREAT LAKES.

FOR TODAY....THE REGION REMAINS IN A CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT WITH SFC 
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUING.  HARD TO DETERMINE PARTLY SUNNY VS MOSTLY 
SUNNY FCST GIVEN THE SPLIT NATURE OF THE FLOW NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE 
OHIO VALLEY.  HOWEVER...HAVE DECIDED THAT THE SRN CWFA WILL MOSTLY 
LIKELY HAVE PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AS THEY ARE CLOSER TO THE PATH 
OF THE HIGH CLOUDS SPILLING FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS.  THE NRN CWFA 
SHOULD JUST SEE PATCHES OF HIGH CLOUDS...SO WILL GO MOSTLY SUNNY 
HERE.  MOS HAS BEEN HARD TO BEAT THESE LAST FEW DAYS.  HAVE POURED 
OVER ALLOW AVAILABLE METHODS (THICKNESS, SOUNDINGS ETC.)...AND THEY 
ALL INDICATED JUST ABOUT WHAT MOS IS SHOWING.  

FOR TONIGHT...A S/WV CURRENTLY ACRS ERN CO AND WRN KS WILL MOVE EAST 
INTO THE CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT.  THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN 850 MB 
MSTR...BUT GIVEN THE LACK OF LOW LVL FORCING...ONLY VIRGA IS 
EXPECTED ATTM.  THUS...WILL LEAVE FCST DRY. LOW TEMPS AROUND 30 OR 
IN THE LOWER 30S LOOKS REASONABLE.

ON FRIDAY...THE AFOREMENTIONED S/WV BECOMES SHEARED APART AS IT GETS 
PULLED INTO THE CONFLUENT FLOW.  AGAIN...AM NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN 
THE WAY OF PCPN AS DYNAMICS WEAK WITH NO LOW LVL FOCUSING.  WILL 
TRIM TEMPS A COUPLE DEGREES FROM MOS GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

TO THE MESO ETA PREDICTION.

REGION WILL REMAIN UNDER A CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT AS SPLIT IN THE NRN 
AND SRN BRANCHES OF THE JET STREAM CONTINUE.  PRECIPITATION 
OCCURRING OVER IOWA/NRN ILLINOIS THIS MORNING (POST FRONTAL) 
...SHOULD WEAKEN TOWARD MORNING AS LOW LVL DEFORMATION AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT WEAKEN.  THUS...AM NOT EXPECTING ANY PCPN TODAY 
BEHIND COLD FRONT. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD SLIDE SLOWLY SOUTH TO A NE 
OHIO...S OF CMH...TO NEAR CVG BY 12Z...THEN INTO THE NRN CWFA BY 
NOON.  PLENTY OF MID AND HIGH LVL CLOUDS (AND A LITTLE LOW LVL MSTR 
BEHIND FRONT) WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY TODAY.  TEMPS WILL BE A 
LITTLE TRICKY...DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH LOW LVL CAA MOVES INTO THE 
REGION.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK...SHEARED OUT VORTICITY MOVES ACRS THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY.  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS...VERY WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT IS 
NOTED AT THE 295 K LEVEL BETWEEN 00Z AND 09Z (FOCUSED NEAR THE OHIO 
RIVER AND SOUTH).  MODELS ARE SHOWING LIGHT QPF DURING THIS TIME 
FRAME.  GIVEN RELATIVELY DRY LOW LVLS AND WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT...I 
AM WONDERING HOW MUCH OF THIS WILL BE USE UP AS VIRGA.  AS A 
RESULT...WILL CUT BACK POPS AT DAY AND CMH TO 20 PERCENT (AND WILL 
NOT MENTION PCPN IN ZONES).  FOR CVG AND PMH GROUPS...WILL MENTION A 
40 POP.  FOR SOUTH OF THE RIVER...WILL GIVE A 50 POP.  PCPN WILL MAY 
MIX WITH A LITTLE RAIN AT PMH AND CVG BRIEFLY.  SOUTH OF THE 
RIVER...PCPN SHOULD BEGIN AS LIGHT RAIN...THEN CHANGE TO SNOW.  
LITTLE OR NO SNOW ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED.

ON WEDNESDAY...SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION FROM THE 
WEST.  DESPITE SHEARED OUT VORTICITY ALOFT ACRS THE REGION...MODELS 
INDICATE DRY RH LVLS FROM 925 MB ON UP.  THUS...MOSTLY SUNNY TO

225 PM EST TUE FEB 27 2001

AT 06Z...SFC COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM SE LOWER MI...NE 
INDIANA...THEN EXTENDED SW INTO S CNTRL IL.  THIS LOCATION WAS CLOSE 
TO THE MESO ETA PREDICTION.

REGION WILL REMAIN UNDER A CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT AS SPLIT IN THE NRN 
AND SRN BRANCHES OF THE JET STREAM CONTINUE.  PRECIPITATION 
OCCURRING OVER IOWA/NRN ILLINOIS THIS MORNING (POST FRONTAL) 
...SHOULD WEAKEN TOWARD MORNING AS LOW LVL DEFORMATION AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT WEAKEN.  THUS...AM NOT EXPECTING ANY PCPN TODAY 
BEHIND COLD FRONT. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD SLIDE SLOWLY SOUTH TO A NE 
OHIO...S OF CMH...TO NEAR CVG BY 12Z...THEN INTO THE NRN CWFA BY 
NOON.  PLENTY OF MID AND HIGH LVL CLOUDS (AND A LITTLE LOW LVL MSTR 
BEHIND FRONT) WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY TODAY.  TEMPS WILL BE A 
LITTLE TRICKY...DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH LOW LVL CAA MOVES INTO THE 
REGION.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK...SHEARED OUT VORTICITY MOVES ACRS THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY.  IN CONJUNCTION WITH THIS...VERY WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT IS 
NOTED AT THE 295 K LEVEL BETWEEN 00Z AND 09Z (FOCUSED NEAR THE OHIO 
RIVER AND SOUTH).  MODELS ARE SHOWING LIGHT QPF DURING THIS TIME 
FRAME.  GIVEN RELATIVELY DRY LOW LVLS AND WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT...I 
AM WONDERING HOW MUCH OF THIS WILL BE USE UP AS VIRGA.  AS A 
RESULT...WILL CUT BACK POPS AT DAY AND CMH TO 20 PERCENT (AND WILL 
NOT MENTION PCPN IN ZONES).  FOR CVG AND PMH GROUPS...WILL MENTION A 
40 POP.  FOR SOUTH OF THE RIVER...WILL GIVE A 50 POP.  PCPN WILL MAY 
MIX WITH A LITTLE RAIN AT PMH AND CVG BRIEFLY.  SOUTH OF THE 
RIVER...PCPN SHOULD BEGIN AS LIGHT RAIN...THEN CHANGE TO SNOW.  
LITTLE OR NO SNOW ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED.

ON WEDNESDAY...SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION FROM THE 
WEST.  DESPITE SHEARED OUT VORTICITY ALOFT ACRS THE REGION...MODELS 
INDICATE DRY RH LVLS FROM 925 MB ON UP.  THUS...MOSTLY SUNNY TO 
PARTLY SUNNY SHOULD SUFFICE.  TEMPS WILL BE ON THE COOL SIDE.

.ILN...NONE

OUR EAST OVERNIGHT WITH RETURN SOUTHERLY FLOW BEGINNING AFTER 06Z.  
THIS RETURN FLOW AND ADVANCING CLOUD COVER WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES

MAX OUT AT 80 KTS.  CONCERNED ABOUT A HIGH WIND EVENT.  THE QUESTION 
THOUGH IS WILL IT BE ASSOCIATED WITH THUNDER OR NOT.  SPC HAS PARTS 
OF WEST OUTLOOKED WITH A SLIGHT RISK.  THIS LOOKS GOOD AS 
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH MOVES.  TROUGH WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH ELEVATED 
LIS AROUND ZERO ALONG WITH THE LOW LEVEL JET (80 KTS) IN CLOSE 
PROXIMITY.  SINCE THIS EVENT IS STILL MORE THAN 24 HOURS OUT IN

THANKS TO SDF AND IWX FOR COORD.

STRONG CONTINENTAL COLD AIRMASS COMING INTO CWA LATE TONIGHT BEHIND 
PASSAGE OF LARGE AREA OF PRECIP THAT SHOULD EXIT CWA BY THIS 
EVENING. WILL TRY TO TIME PRECIP OUT OF SRN FCST GROUPING...BUT MAY 
HAVE TO PLAY WITH ENDING WORDING JUST ALONG AND N OF THE OHIO. WILL 
WAIT UNTIL LAST MINUTE TO DECIDE THIS. A BRIEF MIX MAY OCCUR LATE 
THIS PM BEFORE PRECIP ENDS...BUT WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY MENTION ATTM 
UNLESS REPORTS OF A MIX START FILTERING IN BEFORE PM ISSUANCE. 

GUIDANCE TEMPS ARE FAIRLY CLOSE TO EACH OTHER AND WILL TREND TOWARDS 
THE LOWER NUMBERS DURING THE DAY GIVEN STRENGTH OF COLD AIR IN 
MN/IA/WI THIS MORNING. NIGHTTIME TEMPS SAT PM SHOULD BE A LITTLE 
WARMER THAN GUIDANCE AS NO SNOW COVER SHOULDNT ALLOW US TO DROP TO 
THE SINGLE DIGITS. COLD AMS STAYS IN PLACE THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT, 
WITH WAA DURING PM HOURS AHEAD OF DEVELOPING LOW OVER THE NRN GT 
LKS. EXPECT THAT MOST PRECIP ON MON WILL BE -RA IN GOOD WAA...BUT 
WILL THROW MENTION OF SNOW MIX IN THE NORTHWEST EARLY...AND AGAIN 
FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OVERNIGHT IN CASE CAA ON BACK SIDE OF LOW IS 
STRONG ENOUGH. CANADIAN MODEL SHOWING CHANCE OF A MIX EARLY TUE 
MORNING. 

AFTER THIS, CONFIDENCE IN EXTENDED IS SHOT. JUDGING FROM THE AVN/MRF 
SOLN, ANOTHER SHOT OF GOOD WAA WILL TAKE PLACE AHEAD OF ANOTHER LOW 
ON TUES PM, BUT H5 PATTERN DOESNT LOOK TOO GOOD TO SUPPORT ANY VERY 
STRONG SFC HI OR LO PRESSURE CENTERS. MODELS BRING IN A STRONG LOW 
OVER PACIFIC ON THURSDAY, BUT EXPECT TO SEE THE H5 LOW CONTINUE TO 
DIG AND DEEPEN, SLOWING ANY OTHER SYSTEMS PASSING THROUGH ERN U.S. 
DOWN. 

ONLY CHANGE EXPECTED FOR EXTENDED IS TO INCREASE TEMPS ON TUESDAY

FOR WED WITH PASSAGE OF CDFNT. REST WILL LEAVE AS IS AND TACK ON A

MOVING THE WAVE TO THE WEST.  AVN HAS BEEN THE BEST IN HANDLING THIS

STRONG COLD ADVECTION ON SATURDAY...BUT VERY DRY 850 RH AND ANTI

BROAD RIDGE PERSISTS ACROSS EASTERN CONUS WITH WESTERLY FLOW ACROSS 
THE OHIO VALLEY.  UPPER TROF ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST WILL CONTINUE 
TO DIG SLOWLY EAST OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS AND DRAW LOTS OF PACIFIC 
MOISTURE ACROSS MEXICO INTO THE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEYS.   

SFC MAP SHOWS HIGH TO OUR EAST...WITH DEVELOPING TROF OVER THE 
MISSOURI RIVER VALLEY.  AREA UNDER WARM ADVECTION WITH WINDS 
SWITCHING AROUND TO SOUTH.  WARM ADVECTION IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY UNTIL TROF/COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY 
EVENING. 12Z MODEL RUN IS SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUN...WHICH HAD THE 
FRONT MOVING THROUGH AT AROUND 15Z WEDNESDAY.  THIS TREND WILL 
IMPACT PRECIP AND TEMP FCST. 

MODELS HAVE GENERALLY BACKED OFF ON TONIGHTS RAIN. NATIONAL RADAR 
LOOP (FROM INTERNET) SHOWS PRECIP APPROACHING FROM MISSOURI. MODELS 
SHOW THIS AS AN AREA OF LIGHT RAIN THAT WILL ARRIVE LATE THIS 
EVENING.  RAIN SHOULD ARRIVE AFTER 00Z AT CVG. AM LESS CERTAIN 
ABOUT IT REACHING CMH AND WILL DROP POPS TO 80 PERCENT THERE. 

INGREDIENTS WILL BE COMING TOGETHER FOR MORE RAIN ON WEDNESDAY. 
FACTORS INCLUDE 60 KT 850 MB JET WITH STRONG WARM/MOIST ADVECTION IN 
LOWER LEVELS...500 MB PVA...700MB OMEGA...AND PLENTIFUL 
MOISTURE...WITH SFC BOUNDARY PROVIDING FOCUS. DURATION OF PRECIP 
WILL BE RATHER LONG AS SLOW MOVING SFC FRONT WILL BE ALMOST PARALLEL 
TO UPPER FLOW. WILL GO WITH 100 POPS FOR PERIODS OF RAIN ALL ZONES.  
WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY STILL INDICATED...WILL CONTINUE MENTION OF 
POSSIBLE THUNDER SOUTH.

WITH SLOW MOVING SYSTEM...WILL CONTINUE WET FCST WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
WITH LIKELY POPS. WITH FRONT FINALLY MOVING EAST OF HERE ON 
THURSDAY...WILL GO WITH CHANCE POPS IN THE MORNING.

BROAD RIDGE PERSISTS ACROSS EASTERN CONUS WITH WESTERLY FLOW ACROSS 
THE OHIO VALLEY.  UPPER TROF ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST WILL CONTINUE 
TO DIG SLOWLY EAST OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS AND DRAW LOTS OF PACIFIC 
MOISTURE ACROSS MEXICO INTO THE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEYS.   

SFC MAP SHOWS HIGH TO OUR EAST...WITH DEVELOPING TROF OVER THE 
MISSOURI RIVER VALLEY.  AREA UNDER WARM ADVECTION WITH WINDS 
SWITCHING AROUND TO SOUTH.  WARM ADVECTION IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY UNTIL TROF/COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY 
EVENING. 12Z MODEL RUN IS SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUN...WHICH HAD THE 
FRONT MOVING THROUGH AT AROUND 15Z WEDNESDAY.  THIS TREND WILL 
IMPACT PRECIP AND TEMP FCST. 

MODELS HAVE GENERALLY BACKED OFF ON TONIGHTS RAIN. NATIONAL RADAR 
LOOP (FROM INTERNET) SHOWS PRECIP APPROACHING FROM MISSOURI. MODELS 
SHOW THIS AS AN AREA OF LIGHT RAIN THAT WILL ARRIVE LATE THIS 
EVENING.  RAIN SHOULD ARRIVE AFTER 00Z AT CVG. AM LESS CERTAIN 
ABOUT IT REACHING CMH AND WILL DROP POPS TO 80 PERCENT THERE. 

INGREDIENTS WILL BE COMING TOGETHER FOR MORE RAIN ON WEDNESDAY. 
FACTORS INCLUDE 60 KT 850 MB JET WITH STRONG WARM/MOIST ADVECTION IN 
LOWER LEVELS...500 MB PVA...700MB OMEGA...AND PLENTIFUL 
MOISTURE...WITH SFC BOUNDARY PROVIDING FOCUS. DURATION OF PRECIP 
WILL BE RATHER LONG AS SLOW MOVING SFC FRONT WILL BE ALMOST PARALLEL 
TO UPPER FLOW. WILL GO WITH 100 POPS FOR PERIODS OF RAIN ALL ZONES.  
WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY STILL INDICATED...WILL CONTINUE MENTION OF 
POSSIBLE THUNDER SOUTH.

WITH SLOW MOVING SYSTEM...WILL CONTINUE WET FCST WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
WITH LIKELY POPS. WITH FRONT FINALLY MOVING EAST OF HERE ON 
THURSDAY...WILL GO WITH CHANCE POPS IN THE MORNING. 

AFTER EXAMINING 1000-850 MB THICKNESS ADVECTION PATTERN...WILL TREND 
TOWARD ETA AND AVN FOR TEMPS AND GO SLIGHTLY ABOVE FWC. WILL RAISE 
TEMPS SLIGHTLY FROM PREVIOUS FCST WITH SLOWER FRONTAL MOVEMENT

01Z SFC ANALYSIS SHOWED A WARM FRONT EXTENDING FROM NW PA...ACRS 
LAKE ERIE...FAR SRN LOWER MI..THEN SOUTHWESTWARD TO AN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE NEAR MOLINE IL.  A COLD FRONT TRAILED FROM THE SFC LOW INTO 
NW MO...FAR SE KS...NW OKLA...THEN INTO NRN TX.

KILN RADAR AND RADARS TO THE WEST WERE INDICATING SCATTERED SHOWER 
ACTIVITY.  SOME LIGHTNING STRIKES WERE BEING OBSERVED ACRS IL AND IN.
THE PRECIPITATION WAS DEVELOPING FROM LOW LVL CONVERGENCE ASSOCD 
WITH AN H85 LOW LVL JET.  18Z MESOETA PIVOTS THE NOSE OF THIS LOW 
LVL JET INTO NW OHIO/SRN LOWER MICHIGAN AFTER MIDNIGHT.  THUS...BEST 
CHC FOR SHOWERS WILL BE CLOSER TO THIS REGION...THE NRN MIAMI 
VLY/WAPAKONETA AREA.  FARTHER SOUTH...SHOWER ACTIVITY SHOULD RAPIDLY 
DECREASE.  WILL EMPLOY 40 POPS FAR NORTH...30 POP FOR DAY...AND 20 
POP FOR CVG.  OVER THE ERN AREAS...MAY GO WITH A 20 POP CMH AND JUST 
SPRINKLES FOR THE PMH GROUP.  AS STATED BEFORE...SOME LIGHTNING WAS 
OBSERVED TO THE WEST (ELEVATED CONVECTION).  FOR NOW...I AM LEANING 
NOT TO INCLUDE TSTM CHC/S IN THE FAR NORTH...BUT AN ISOLD ONE COULD 
STILL DEVELOP.

TOMORROW LOOKS TO BE REAL INTERESTING.  VERY STRONG WINDS ALOFT (55 
KTS AT 925 MB AND 85 KTS AT 850 MB) AHEAD AND JUST BEHIND THE COLD 
FRONT COULD POSE SOME PROBLEMS.  RIGHT NOW...CAN FORESEE A 
CONCENTRATED LINE OF CONVECTION WITH THE COLD FRONT.   TSTM 
POTENTIAL LOOKS BEST ACRS THE SRN CWFA WHERE BETTER LOW LVL MSTR 
WILL BE REALIZED.  HOWEVER...SHOWERS ALONE COULD ALLOW STRONG WINDS 
ALOFT TO REACH THE SFC.  HIGH WIND WATCH LOOKS GOOD ATTM AS SFC 
WINDS WILL BE IN THE 30 TO 40 MPH RANGE.  HOW THE VERY STRONG WIND 
GUSTS WILL BE HANDLE TOMORROW WILL DEPEND ON WHAT EXACTLY 
MATERIALIZES WITH THE FRONT.  WE WILL SEE.

STRONG UPPER TROF OVER ARIZONA IS CARVING A PATH TOWARD THE OHIO

SFC MAP HAS LOW OVER SOUTHERN ROCKIES. MASSIVE INVERTED SFC TROF 
NORTHEAST OF LOW EXTENDS TO UPPER LAKES. PRECIP IS ALREADY OCCURRING 
IN OUR SOUTHWEST COUNTIES IN WARM ADVECTION WELL AHEAD OF THE MAIN 
SYSTEM. SHOWERS SHOULD AFFECT OUR WHOLE AREA IN SCATTERED FASHION BY 
LATE EVENING. WILL INCLUDE CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES FOR EVENING 
SHOWERS. 

SFC LOW CENTER IS PROGGED TO LAKE MICHIGAN BY 12Z FRIDAY WITH STRONG 
COLD FRONT TRAILING TO THE GULF OF MEXICO. FRONT IS THEN FCST TO BE 
OVER OUR AREA FRIDAY EVENING. MAIN PROBLEM WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL 
INVOLVE WINDS AS MODELS INDICATE 30KT+ SUSTAINED AT SFC WITH 90KTS 
AT 850 MB. WILL ISSUE HIGH WIND WATCH FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT 
WITH CLE PROVIDING GOOD GUIDANCE FOR THIS EVENT. 

PLENTY OF MOISTURE ASSOC WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING INTO OUR

POPS IN WEST ON FRIDAY...WITH 50 POPS EAST AT CMH AND PMH. WILL GO

THE WEST. SVR TS ALSO COULD BE A PROBLEM WITH STRONG FLOW. EXPECT 
PRECIP TO END BEFORE REALLY COLD AIR ARRIVES SO WILL NOT MENTION 
SNOW AT ALL FRIDAY NIGHT.

FWC TEMPS LOOK FAIRLY GOOD CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENCE FROM 
CLIMATOLOGICAL NORMALS. WILL GO ABOVE FWC TONIGHT WITH WINDS STAYING

NOT EXPECTING ANY BIG CHANGES IN THINKING WITH SYSTEM THAT MOVES 
THROUGH OH VLY ON FRIDAY AS PREVIOUS FCSTS WERE FOCUSING ON AVNS 
SOLUTION. ETA AND NGM ARE BEGINNING TO SLOW DOWN COME IN LINE WITH 
THE LARGER FEATURES ON AVN, WHICH HAS A GOOD RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY 
AFTER VIEWING H5 FIELDS ON DPROG/DT.

HOWEVER, WITH THE WIND EVENT WITHIN THE FORECAST REALM OF THE ETA, 
ITS SHOWING MOISTURE ANOMALIES ON THE ORDER OF +7.0 STANDARD 
DEVIATIONS ABOVE NORMAL WITH A LLJET OVER IN/MI ON THE +5-6 SCALE 
TOO. 

CONCERN RIGHT NOW IS HOW MUCH WIND WELL GET AHEAD OF FRONTAL 
PASSAGE. MODELS POINTING AT A SCREAMING LLJET OVER FCST AREA ON 
FRIDAY. ETAS 90KTS AT THIS LEVEL IN NW OH AT 18Z LOOKS A BIT 
OVERDONE, BUT AVN PROGGING A 70KT JET IN SAME PLACE BY 0Z. ETA WIND

TONIGHT AND WORK ITS WAY UP TO WINDY ON FRIDAY. AM UNSURE AS TO HOW 
MUCH OF THIS JET WILL ACTUALLY GET TRANSLATED TO THE GROUND IN WAA, 
SO WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY CHICKEN LITTLE OUTLOOKS ATTM.

IN A NUTSHELL, PREVIOUS FCSTS HAVE A HANDLE ON WHATS COMING DOWN

TAKING PLACE FOR TEMPERATURES - AND TRY TO TIME PRECIP ON FRIDAY. 
WITH MODELS TRENDING SLOWER...FROPA OVER CWA SHOULD BE SOMETIME

MAIN QUESTIONS WITH MORNING PACKAGE WILL BE CONCERNING CHANCE OF 
PRECIP THIS EVENING IN NORTHWEST WITH PASSAGE OF WARM FRONT AND ODDS 
OF PRECIP ON THURSDAY. 

RIGHT NOW...AVN HAS BEST HANDLE ON MID LEVEL CLOUD COVER CURRENTLY 
OVER KY. ALL MODELS PUSH HIGHEST MOISTURE THROUGH CWA FROM 0-6Z 
TONIGHT AND MESOETA BRINGS A WEAK LINE OF MEASURABLE PRECIP TO THE 
NORTHWEST. THIS COOINCIDES WITH AN AREA OF BEST 850-700 UVV OVER 
NORTHERN INDY DURING SAME TIME FRAME. RIGHT NOW...40 AND 30 POPS 
RUNNING FOR WAPAKONETA AND DAYTON...WILL PROBABLY BUMP DOWN TO 30 
AND 20 (SPRINKLES) AND MENTION BEFORE MIDNIGHT OR EVENING WORDING. 
WILL TAKE MENTION OF SPRINKLES OUT OF DAYTIME PERIOD. 

NEXT PROBLEM IS CHANCE OF PRECIP ON THURSDAY. WITH VERY GOOD LLVL 
JET SETTING UP...MOISTURE WILL BE SURGING INTO FCST AREA WITH BEST 
ADVECTION CLOSEST TO SFC FRONT. AVN KEEPS ENTIRE AREA DRY...AND WITH 
RH FIELDS AT H8 AND H7 ON THE DRIER SIDE UNDER A RIDGE...I LIKE THIS 
THINKING. ETA/MESOETA SHOW RELATIVELY SAME RH FIELDS...BUT CRANK OUT 
PRECIP FOR MUCH OF FCST AREA...ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST. RIGHT NOW...I 
WONT CHANGE THE 30 POPS WE CURRENTLY HAVE RUNNING IN THE NORTHWEST 
...BUT FAVOR THE DRIER AVN. REASONING WITH THIS IS THAT CWA SHOULD 
BE IN RIGHT EXIT REGION OF LLVL JET AND THERE IS ONLY SOME WEAK H3 
DIVERGENCE. H5 RIDGE STILL IN PLACE THOUGH SLOWLY PROGRESSING EAST 
AHEAD OF DIGGING TROF IN PLAINS STATES.

JET SETTING UP...MOISTURE WILL BE SURGING INTO FCST AREA WITH BEST 
ADVECTION CLOSEST TO SFC FRONT. AVN KEEPS ENTIRE AREA DRY...AND WITH 
RH FIELDS AT H8 AND H7 ON THE DRIER SIDE UNDER A RIDGE...I LIKE THIS 
THINKING. ETA/MESOETA SHOW RELATIVELY SAME RH FIELDS...BUT CRANK OUT 
PRECIP FOR MUCH OF FCST AREA...ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST. RIGHT NOW...I 
WONT CHANGE THE 30 POPS WE CURRENTLY HAVE RUNNING IN THE NORTHWEST 
...BUT FAVOR THE DRIER AVN. REASONING WITH THIS IS THAT CWA SHOULD 
BE IN RIGHT EXIT REGION OF LLVL JET AND THERE IS ONLY SOME WEAK H3 
DIVERGENCE. H5 RIDGE STILL IN PLACE THOUGH SLOWLY PROGRESSING EAST 
AHEAD OF DIGGING TROF IN PLAINS STATES.

.ILN...NONE.

250 AM EST SAT FEB 3 2001

FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY HAS SUDDENLY BECOME A LOT MORE 
COMPLICATED.  BUT BEFORE WE GET TO THAT...LETS TAKE CARE OF TODAY. 
AREA OF LIGHT SNOW ACROSS IL/WESTERN INDIANA IS IN AN AREA OF STRONG 
WAA...IN COMBINATION WITH PVA FROM VORT MAX DROPPING SE.  VORT IS 
FORECAST TO BE ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN COUNTIES BY 12Z...BUT IT HAS 
OUTRUN THE WAA WHICH WILL STILL BE ACROSS INDIANA. THEREFORE DONT 
EXPECT THE SNOW TO REACH US...ONLY CLOUDS FROM THE SYSTEM.

AM STRUGGLING WITH HOW MUCH CLOUDS WE WILL HAVE TODAY. SATELLITE 
LOOP IS SHOWING CLEARING ACROSS IL BEHIND THE VORT.  THE RH FIELDS 
ON THE MODELS ARENT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE EITHER. I HATE TO FLIP FLOP ON 
THE FORECAST...BUT FEEL THAT MOSTLY CLOUDY WILL BE TOO PESSIMISTIC.  
WILL GO WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS MORNING...MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS 
AFTERNOON. MOS TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO THE CURRENT FORECAST...SO NO 
ARGUMENTS THERE. 

NOW BACK TO TONIGHT.  THE ETA IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE IN PUSHING QPF 
INTO THE WEST BY 06Z AND ACROSS THE ENTIRE FA BY 12Z. THE 00Z 
MESO-ETA DELAYS THE QPF TIL AFT 09Z AND KEEPS IT ONLY ACROSS THE 
NORTH...WHILE THE AVN AND NGM HOLD OFF THE QPF TIL AFTER 12Z. IF QPF 
DOES MAKE IT IN OVERNIGHT THE PRECIP TYPE IS IN DOUBT. THE ETA 
PUSHES THE 850 MB 0C LINE AS FAR NORTH AS DAY BY 06Z. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS ARE SHOWING A LARGE ELEVATED AREA OF ABOVE ZERO TEMPS A 
COUPLE THOUSAND FEET THICK.  THE 1000-850 THICKNESS WOULD SUGGEST 
THAT THE PRECIP WOULD BE RAIN FOR A GOOD PART OF THE NIGHT.   OF 
COURSE WITH SURFACE TEMPERATURES BELOW FREEZING THAT WOULD MEAN 
FREEZING RAIN.  HOWEVER BUFKIT IS INDICATING THAT THE PRECIP WOULD 
BE MOSTLY SNOW...SUGGESTING THAT THE COLD AIR AT LOW LEVELS WOULD BE 
DEEP ENOUGH TO CHANGE THE RAIN BACK TO SNOW.

WILL GO WITH THE COMPROMISE MESO-ETA AND WILL KEEP THE MENTION OF 
PRECIP ONLY IN THE NORTH TONIGHT. WILL CHANGE THE CURRENT FORECAST 
OF CHANCE OF SNOW AFTER MIDNIGHT...TO A CHANCE OF SNOW...SLEET OR 
FREEZING RAIN. WILL THAN HAVE TO MENTION A MIX IN THE MORNING IN THE 
SOUTH.  LOOKING AT THE THICKNESSES...I HAVE HAVING A HARD TIME 
BELIEVING THAT THE WE WILL MAKE IT AS WARM NGM MOS THINKS ON SUNDAY. 
WILL GO WITH THE MAV TEMPERATURES ALTHOUGH I HAVE MY DOUBTS THAT WE 
WILL EVEN GET THAT WARM. WILL HAVE THE PRECIP CHANGING TO ALL RAIN 
IN THE AFTERNOON FOR ALL LOCATIONS. WILL GO WITH A SWITCH BACK TO 
SNOW SUNDAY NIGHT.

CLEMISILN OUT ASAP.

ARCTIC COLD FRONT WAS EAST OF THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS AREAS OF CUMULUS CLOUD DEVELOPMENT 
...MOST CONCENTRATED IN WRN AND CNTRL OH.  CUMULUS CLOUDS SHOULD 
GRADUALLY DISSIPATE THIS EVENING AS LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY DECREASES 
AFTER SUNSET.  FORECAST PROBLEM FOR TONIGHT WILL BE THE ARRIVAL OF 
MAINLY MID AND HIGH LVL MSTR FROM THE NRN PLAINS STATES.  THE MSTR 
IS AN ASSOCIATION WITH MID LVL WAA AND WEAK S/WV ENERGY IN THE NW 
FLOW ALOFT.  THE MSTR...IN THE FORM OF AC/CI...WILL STOP ANY EARLY 
EVENING COOLING.  IN FACT...TEMPERATURES WILL PROBABLY ACTUALLY 
SLOWLY RISE OVERNIGHT ONCE THE AC BECOMES ESTABLISHED.  THE 
DISSIPATION OF THE CUMULUS AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE AC/CI WILL MAKE 
FOR A DIFFICULT CLOUD WORDING TONIGHT.  WILL EITHER MENTION 
INCREASING CLOUDS WHERE IT IS MAINLY CLEAR NOW AND VARIABLE CLOUDS

ARCTIC COLD FRONT WAS EAST OF THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS AREAS OF CUMULUS CLOUD DEVELOPMENT 
...MOST CONCENTRATED IN WRN AND CNTRL OH.  CUMULUS CLOUDS SHOULD 
GRADUALLY DISSIPATE THIS EVENING AS LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY DECREASES 
AFTER SUNSET.  FORECAST PROBLEM FOR TONIGHT WILL BE THE ARRIVAL OF 
MAINLY MID AND HIGH LVL MSTR FROM THE NRN PLAINS STATES.  THE MSTR 
IS AN ASSOCIATION WITH MID LVL WAA AND WEAK S/WV ENERGY IN THE NW 
FLOW ALOFT.  THE MSTR...IN THE FORM OF AC/CI...WILL STOP ANY EARLY 
EVENING COOLING.  IN FACT...TEMPERATURES WILL PROBABLY ACTUALLY 
SLOWLY RISE OVERNIGHT ONCE THE AC BECOMES ESTABLISHED.  THE 
DISSIPATION OF THE CUMULUS AND THE ARRIVAL OF THE AC/CI WILL MAKE 
FOR A DIFFICULT CLOUD WORDING TONIGHT.  WILL EITHER MENTION 
INCREASING CLOUDS WHERE IT IS MAINLY CLEAR NOW AND VARIABLE CLOUDS 
WHERE CUMULUS IS LOCATED.  WITH THE TRICKY CLOUD FCST...WILL STICK 
CLOSE TO MOS VALUES FOR EARLY NIGHT TIME LOWS.

ON SATURDAY...S/WV ENERGY NOW PUSHING INTO THE PAC NW WILL DIVE INTO

ARCTIC COLD FRONT WAS NOW EAST OF THE CWFA AT 14Z.

THE SNOW ASSOCD WITH THE ARCTIC FRONT SHOULD BE OUT OF THE CWFA 
AROUND 1030 AM THIS MORNING.  AFTER THAT...SKIES WILL BECOME PARTLY 
CLOUDY.  THE BIG FCST PROBLEM FOR THIS AFTN WILL BE THE CHC/S FOR

RESULT...I AM NOT EXPECTING ANY LAKE MICHIGAN SNOW BANDS TO OCCUR

CHILL VALULES AROUND MINUS 20 DEGREES BELOW ZERO.  THIS IS RIGHT AT

TOWARD ISSUING A SPS TO COVER THE WIND CHILL VALUES AROUND MINUS 
20.  THE HOPE IS THAT THE TEMPS WILL NOT DROP NO LOWER THAN 10 
DEGREES.  WITH THE FRESH 0.5 TO 1 INCH SNOW COVER...BELIEVE TEMPS IN

AS WEAK WAA CONTINUES ALOFT THROUGH THIS EVENING...LOW LEVEL CLOUDS 
SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THE ERN CWFA.  THUS...THERE WILL BE A BREAK IN 
CLOUD COVER THIS EVENING (MOST LOCATIONS) BEFORE ARCTIC COLD FRONT 
MOVES INTO THE REGION OVERNIGHT.

ALL MODELS ARE SIMILAR WITH THE SYNOPTIC FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE ARCTIC COLD FRONT.  THE NGM MAY BE JUST A TAD FASTER.  ALL IN 
ALL...HAVE USED A BLEND OF THE ETA/AVN FOR THE TIMING.  MSTR NOT 
VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH THE FRONT.  HOWEVER...MODELS SHOW AN INCREASE 
IN PVA OVERNIGHT.  THUS...AREAS OF LIGHT SNOW SHOULD BREAK OUT ALONG 
AND JUST BEHIND THE FRONT IN THE WEST AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND LATE IN 
THE ERN CWFA.  A LIGHT DUSTING IS ONLY EXPECTED ATTM.

BIG QUESTION WILL BE HOW COLD IT WILL GET BY TOMORROW MORNING AND ON 
FRIDAY ONCE THE ARCTIC FRONT PASSES THROUGH.  TEMPERATURES WERE 
DROPPING INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS BEHIND THE FRONT AFTER PASSAGE.  
HOWEVER...THESE AREAS (IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND WESTERN GREAT 
LAKES) STILL HAVE SNOW COVER.  I AM NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH AT THIS 
TIME TO GO EXTREMELY COLD FOR LOWS BY FRIDAY MORNING ( BETWEEN 7 AM 
AND 9 AM WESTERN LOCATIONS) AS I AM NOT CERTAIN HOW THE LACK OF SNOW 
COVER WILL RETARD THE STRENGTH OF THE COLD PUSH.  FOR NOW...WILL 
KEEP THE GENERAL TEMPERATURE TREND WE HAVE BEEN EMPLOYING THE LAST 
FEW FORECASTS.  THE EVENING SHIFT SHOULD HAVE A BETTER FEEL OF 
WHETHER TO LOWER TEMPS BY THE MORNING HOURS DEPENDING HOW 
TEMPERATURES FALL ACRS THE SNOWLESS PARTS OF CNTRL IL AND IN.

ON FRIDAY...TEMPERATURES WILL SHOW LITTLE RECOVERY.  CYCLONIC FLOW 
ALOFT COMBINED WITH SOME MSTR FROM THE GREAT LAKES SHOULD RESULT IN 
A PARTLY CLOUDY DAY.  A FEW FLURRIES MAY FLOAT ACRS THE REGION FROM 
TIME TO TIME...MAINLY IN THE NORTH.

BY FRIDAY NIGHT...SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION.  
HOWEVER...A WEAK S/WV IN THE H5 NWLY FLOW ALOFT WILL SPREAD SOME MID

SOUTHWEST FLOW...HAVE DECIDED TO STICK CLOSE TO MOS TEMPERATURES.

SATURDAY WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY AS SOME LOW AND MID LVL MSTR CONTINUE

CWFA WILL REMAIN UNDER A SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT FOR THIS AFTN.  

LOW CLOUDS CONTINUE ACRS THE REGION PER VISIBLE SATELLITE LOOP.  
BACK EDGE OF CLEARING IS NOW PUSHING INTO ERN INDIANA.  BASED ON 
SATELLITE TRENDS...THE WRN CWFA SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR BETWEEN 11 AM 
AND 1 PM.  FOR THE ERN AREAS...CLEARING MAY NOT OCCUR UNTIL MID 
AFTN.  REGARDLESS...CURRENT WORDING OF BECOMING MOSTLY SUNNY WEST 
AND PARTLY SUNNY EAST LOOK GOOD.  USING LATEST ILN SOUNDING AND 
MODEL SOUNDINGS...FCST TEMPS INTO THE UPPER 30S TO AROUND 40 ARE 
REASONABLE...WITH THE FAR EASTERN LOCATIONS REACHING THE LOWER END 
OF THE UPPER 30S TODAY (37).

AN ARCTIC FRONT WAS PUSHING THROUGH WISCONSIN AND IOWA THIS 
MORNING.  THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO TRAVERSE THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY 
TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING...BRINGING MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES AND 
PERHAPS A LITTLE LIGHT SNOW.

AN UPDATE WILL BE ISSUED THIS MORNING...MAINLY TO CLEAR UP WORDING 
AND ADJUST TIMING OF CLEARING TREND.

NEW MODEL RUNS ARE COMPLEMENTING FCST FROM YESTERDAY. DONT EXPECT 
TOO MANY CHANGES FOR THE BIG PICTURE.

H5 LOW WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY TRANSLATE ENERGY UNDER WEAK RIDGE 
OVER NEW ENGLAND. SFC ENERGY WILL FOLLOW AND RE-DEVELOP AS IT HITS 
THE COAST. MEANWHILE, A NEBULOUS PIECE OF THE ENERGY SHOULD HANG 
TOUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES. WAITING FOR H5 TROF TO SPIN IT UP 
SOMETIME LATE THURSDAY/EARLY FRIDAY.

THIS ALONG WITH H8 COLD POOL SLOWLY OVERSPREADING THE FCST AREA WILL 
KEEP MOCLOUDY SKIES AND CHANCE FOR LIGHT PRECIP WITHOUT ANY OBVIOUS 
TRIGGER TO SUPPORT SHOWERS. WILL PROBABLY KEEP WORDING OF SPRINKLES 
AND FLURRIES OR GO WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS.

FOR TONIGHT, 1000-850 THICKNESSES BEGIN TO SUPPORT A CHANGEOVER TO 
SNOW JUST BEFORE DAYBREAK BUT DECREASING UPWARD MOTION OVERNIGHT 
SUGGESTS THAT ANY PRECIP OCCURRING WILL NOT BE MEASURABLE OR 
SIGNIFICANT.

TEMPERATURES BEHIND WEAK FRONT (MORE OF A WINDSHIFT) DROP TO THE MID 
30S FOR MUCH OF FCST AREA AND HOLD NEARLY STEADY UNDER MOCLOUDY 
SKIES TONIGHT. 

GENERAL FORECAST TREND OF SPRINKLES/FLURRIES AND SMALL DIURNALS

TROF BUILDS TO THE NORTH OF FCST AREA OVER NEXT DAY OR TWO AND 
FINALLY SWINGS THROUGH DURING THE DAY FRIDAY WITH WAA IN ITS WAKE.

MODELS INDICATING FOR S/W ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK BAND OF SHOWERS IN 
WEST CENTRAL OHIO TO ROTATE NORTH INTO THE H5 LOW. AFTER THIS, 
ANOTHER SHOT OF LIGHT RAIN WITH EMBEDDED SHOWERS IS EXPECTED TO

TO REMAIN OVER SRN FCST AREA IN KY, AND RIGHT NOW ONLY SECTION OF 
FCST AREA THAT STANDS ANY CHANCE OF THUNDER IS THE SOUTH. ELEVATED 
LAPSE RATES ACTUALLY DECREASE SLIGHTLY AS THE DAY PROGRESSES, AND 
ARE BEST IN NORTHERN FCST AREA AHEAD OF VORT.

WILL REMOVE THUNDER FOR ALL AREAS AND UPDATE IF NECESSARY.

AS FOR POPS, WILL NOT REDUCE THE 90% THAT WE HAVE FOR WRN FCST AREA 
AS AN AREA OF RAIN IS ENCROACHING FROM THE SOUTHWEST. HOWEVER, I 
FEEL THAT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DAY WILL NOT BE SHOWERS. WILL TRY TO

ANOTHER SHOT OF LIGHT RAIN WITH EMBEDDED SHOWERS IS EXPECTED TO 
ENTER SWRN FCST AREA. VORTICITY ADVECTION THROUGH THE AFTERNOON IS 
NEUTRAL TO WEAKLY NEGATIVE, ALTHOUGH ANOTHER NOSE OF PVA IS EXPECTED 
TO ENTER ALONG THE OHIO RIVER AROUND 0Z. GOOD 50+KT H8 JET PROGGED 
TO REMAIN OVER SRN FCST AREA IN KY, AND RIGHT NOW ONLY SECTION OF 
FCST AREA THAT STANDS ANY CHANCE OF THUNDER IS THE SOUTH. ELEVATED 
LAPSE RATES ACTUALLY DECREASE SLIGHTLY AS THE DAY PROGRESSES, AND 
ARE BEST IN NORTHERN FCST AREA AHEAD OF VORT.

WILL REMOVE THUNDER FOR ALL AREAS AND UPDATE IF NECESSARY.

AS FOR POPS, WILL NOT REDUCE THE 90% THAT WE HAVE FOR WRN FCST AREA 
AS AN AREA OF RAIN IS ENCROACHING FROM THE SOUTHWEST. HOWEVER, I 
FEEL THAT CHARACTERISTIC OF THE DAY WILL NOT BE SHOWERS. WILL TRY TO 
WORD IT WITH MO CY WITH A PERIOD OR PERIODS OF SHOWERS. IN CENTRAL

06Z SFC ANALYSIS INDICATED AN OCCLUDED FRONT ALONG THE OH-IN BORDER

PRESSURE WAS LOCATED OVER ERN MO.  THIS SECONDARY LOW WAS ASSOCIATED 
WITH A STRONG S/WV MOVG QUICKLY ACROSS MO-AR TOWARD THE OH VLY.  
ANOTHER BATCH OF -SHRA HAD DEVELOPED ALONG THE OCCLUDED BOUNDARY DUE 
TO FORCING FROM THE S/WV.

S/WV AND ASSOCIATED STEEP MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WL MOVE ACROSS FA FM 
12Z-15Z.  XPCT AN AREA OF SHRA/TSRA TO AFFECT FA DURING THE AM

DURING THE PM HOURS.  META SHOWS 50+ H8 JET ACROSS KY WITH THE 
ASSOCIATED CONVERGENCE ACROSS SRN OH.  THIS SHOULD LEAD TO 
WIDESPREAD SHRA WITH SOME TSRA FOR THE PM HOURS.  A NARROW AREA OF 
HEAVY RAIN IS POSSIBLE SOMEWHERE IN SWRN AND CNTRL OH.  WL CARRY CAT 
POPS ALL AREAS BUT VC PMH AND NRN KY.  BEST FORCING SHOULD BE NORTH 
OF THOSE AREAS.

XPCT WIDESPREAD SHRA BEFORE MIDNIGHT AND THEN ACTIVITY WL SHIFT TO

QUICKLY ENOUGH TO CHANGE RAIN TO SNOW.  PLENTY OF MOISTURE ON WED

INTERESTING FORECAST IN STORE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH AN 
EXTREMELY UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN SHAPING UP FOR FCST AREA. 

MODELS DIVERGE ON WEDNESDAY WITH SEVERAL WEAK WAVES MOVING THROUGH 
THE H5 PATTERN. CURRENTLY, IT LOOKS LIKE A GENERAL TREND IS THE ONLY 
THING TO HANG THE FORECAST ON. THOUGH MODELS DIFFER IN STRENGTH AND 
POSITIONS OF SURFACE AND H5 FEATURES...THE BROAD PICTURE IS IN FAIR 
AGREEMENT. NAMELY...THE SURFACE BOMB OVER IOWA GETS UNDERCUT BY THE 
H5 CLOSED LOW AND WEAKENS CONSIDERABLY IN THE DOWNWARD MOTION ON NW 
SIDE. COLD FRONT WITH CATEGORICAL SHOWERS AHEAD OF IT SCREAMS PAST 
FCST AREA TONIGHT, AND SFC LOW REDEVELOPS SOMEWHERE IN THE GENERAL 
VISCINITY OF NEW YORK STATE. THEN IT MOVES TO SOMEWHERE IN NEW 
ENGLAND BY 12Z WED. H5 TROF AND LEFTOVER SFC FEATURES HANG TOUGH 
OVER GT LKS AND WAITS FOR NEXT S/W TO SWING DOWN AND FIRE UP A WHOLE 
NEW SFC LOW IN CENTRAL MICHIGAN OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY. 

AT H8, THERMAL RIDGE PASSES OVER FCST AREA TONIGHT, WITH DECENT COLD 
POOL ENTERING OVERNIGHT TUESDAY. AS ENERGY IN ATMOSPHERE REMAINS IN 
GT LKS REGION, MOIST LOWER LEVELS WILL NOT HAVE A CHANCE TO GET 
SCOURED OUT. RH AND COLD AIR MAKE FOR CLOUDY. NEUTRAL TO WEAK COLD 
TEMP ADVECTION IN LOWER LEVELS BEHIND SFC FRONT WOULD IMPLY A SMALL 
DIURNAL, AND CLOUD COVER SAYS EVEN SMALLER. H8 TEMPS SLOWLY DECREASE 
THROUGH FRIDAY...AND WILL KEEP CLOUDS AND CHANCE FOR PRECIP THROUGH 
THIS TIME. THOUGH IT WONT BE A TOTAL WASH-OUT THROUGH THIS PERIOD, 
WILL TRY TO INDICATE SPRINKLES FOR SOME AREAS WHEN PRECIP IS LESS 
LIKELY (TUES NIGHT-WED).

AS FOR TEMPERATURES, WILL NOT DIVERGE MUCH FROM PREVIOUS FCST. WILL 
EXPECT TO HAVE AT LEAST ONE OR TWO PERIODS OF STEADY WORDING AS WELL.

IN SRN HALF OF FCST AREA TONIGHT...LIS GO TO ZERO OR A LITTLE 
NEGATIVE AROUND 12Z AND ETA SHOWING SOME WEAK SFC BASED CAPE ALONG 
WITH ELEVATED INSTABILITY. WILL THROW IN POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORM

HIGH CLOUDS CONT TO STREAM INTO THE CWFA FROM THE WEST...BUT WITH 
AREA DOWNSTREAM OF RIDGE AXIS THE CLOUDS WERE THINNING.  ALSO A BIT 
OF STRATUS OVER THE FAR NORTH...BUT XPCT THIS TO EXIT THE AREA ERLY 
THIS MORNING.  WL USE PTLY SUNNY ALL ZONES WITH FILTERED SUNSHINE.
SNOW CVR WHICH HAS HELPED VTA DROP TO 4 DEG THIS MORNING WL KEEP 
TEMPS RATHER COOL ACRS THE NORTH TDY.  FWC HAS MADE A DOWNWARD 
ADJUSTMENT...AND LINES UP FAIRLY WELL WITH THE META SFC TEMPS AND 
THE COOLER MAV NUMBERS.  WL STICK CLOSE TO THE FWC.

DPROG/DT ANALYSIS OF THE 00Z MODEL RUNS INDC THE ETA HAS BEEN 
GRADUALLY TRENDING TWRD THE STRONGER...FURTHER WEST...AND QUITE 
CONSISTENT AVN SOLN.  THE NGM REAMINS CONSISTENTLY MUCH WEAKER...AND 
AS A RESULT IS MUCH LESS AGGRESSIVE SPREADING PCPN AND WARMER AIR 
INTO THE RGN.  AS FAR AS QPF GOES...THRU 06Z THE NGM IS NOTICEABLY 
UNDERDONE OVER MO/KS...WITH THE AVN AND ETA MUCH BETTER.  GIVEN THE 
IMPRESSIVE STRENGTH OF THE UPPER SYS ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY...A 
NOTICEABLE INFLUX OF GULF MSTR OVER TX...AND THE AFOREMENTIONED 
INITIAL QPF ISSUES HV LEANED TWRD AN AVN/ETA COMPROMISE THIS PKG.

MAIN FCST CONCERN IS NEXT SYSTEM THATS EXPECTED TO HIT OHIO VALLEY 
MON INTO TUES. ALL MODELS SHOWING A GOOD CONCENSUS ON WHERE H5 LOW 
IS GOING TO BE AT 0Z TUES...RIGHT ALONG THE MO/KS BORDER SOUTH OF 
MKC. SFC CYCLOGENESIS OCCURS OVER ARKANSAS EARLIER ON MONDAY WITH 
APPROACH OF H5 LOW IN WRN KS AT 12Z. 

MODELS DIFFER SLIGHTLY FROM HERE...ETA BRINGS THE SFC LOW JUST A BIT 
FURTHER EAST AHEAD OF H5 LOW. THIS TRANSLATES A LITTLE MORE ENERGY 
INTO THE WARM SECTOR THAT STRETCHES OVER OHIO DURING THE DAY. THOUGH 
MODEL DISCUSSIONS ARE TRENDING TOWARDS THE ETA SOLN OVER TIME...I 
THINK THAT THE AVN HAS A BETTER HANDLE ON WHAT PRECIP IS ACTUALLY 
GOING TO OCCUR AWAY FROM THE H5 AND SFC LOWS. 

SOUTHEAST WIND IN LOW LEVELS WITH THE GULF OPENING UP ON MONDAY 
SHOULD BRING A CONSTANT LOWERING OF CLOUD DECK THAT SHOULD BE IN 
PLACE BY MORNING. PROBLEM HERE IS THAT THE DRY LAYER A FEW THOUSAND 
FEET ABOVE SFC IS QUITE DEEP AND I FEEL THAT THE ETA MOISTENS IT UP 
JUST A BIT TOO QUICK AND THEN STARTS TO CRANK OUT PRECIP WITHOUT 
MUCH FORCING...JUST SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT. MESOETA AND AVN LOOK TO BE 
FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH PLACING BEST QPF CLOSER TO THE SOUTHWEST AND 
KEEPS THE EASTERN PORTION OF FCST AREA DRY. WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS 
IN THE WEST...CHANCE OR HIGH CHANCE WITH EMPHASIS ON EARLY IN THE 
EAST. DRY SLOT SETS UP AND THERE SEEMS TO BE A BREAK BEFORE MAIN 
BATCH OF RAIN COMES IN AHEAD OF SFC LOW. LOW LEVEL TEMPS START OUT 
QUITE COLD...SO WILL MENTION PRECIP BEGINNING AS FZRA IN ALL AREAS. 
WILL HOLD OFF ON POPS FOR SUNDAY PM IN THE EAST...AND GO LOWER 
CHANCE IN THE WEST WITH FZRA.

AS FOR TEMPS...WILL LIKELY UNDERCUT MOS TONIGHT AS CLOUD SHIELD IS 
QUICKLY BEING ERODED AND MID TEENS DWPTS ARE FOUND JUST UPSTREAM.

DIFFICULT CLOUD AND TEMPERATURE FCST FOR TODAY.

11-3.9 MICRON SATELLITE IMAGERY WAS SHOWING DEVELOPING LOW LEVEL 
CLOUDS ACRS THE WRN AND NRN CWFA.  THIS APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED 
AHEAD AND JUST BEHIND A WEAK SFC TROF NOW SLICING THE CWFA IN TWO.  
LOOKING AT LOW LEVEL RH FIELDS ON THE MESOETA...975 MB MSTR 
INDICATES THAT THE CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACRS THE REMAINDER 
OF THE CWFA THROUGH SUNRISE.  BELIEVE THIS WILL BE THE CASE AS THIS 
IS OCCURRING ON SATELLITE LOOPS.  BIG QUESTION FOR TODAY WILL BE:  
WILL SOME AREAS...PARTICULARLY THE SRN CWFA...SEE ABUNDANT SUNSHINE 
BEFORE NEXT BATCH OF LOW CLOUDS ARRIVE THIS AFTN THROUGH SUNSET FROM 
ASSOCD COLD FRONT NOW OVER THE WRN GREAT LAKES?  I BELIEVE THE SRN 
CWFA WILL SEE SOME SUNSHINE ONCE THE SFC TROF EXITS TO THE EAST AND 
SOME SUNSHINE TRIES TO ERODE SHALLOW MOIST LAYER.   WILL LAKE LAST 
MINUTE DECISION ON HOW TO WORD TODAY/S SKY CONDITION.  THICKNESS 
SCHEMES INDICATE TEMPS MAY BE CLOSE TO YESTERDAY/S HIGHS ESPECIALLY 
SOUTH AHEAD OF COLD FRONT.  WILL BUMP UP JUST A TAD.  WILL KEEP CHC 
OF AFTN/LATE AFTN FLURRIES IN THE NORTH AS COLD AIR PUSHES ACRS LAKE 
MICHIGAN.

FOR TONIGHT...VIGOROUS H5 S/WV AND ASSOCD VORT MAX PIVOTS SE JUST 
BEHIND THE COLD FRONT INTO THE MIDDLE OHIO VLY.  ALL MODELS 
GENERALLY AGREE WITH SPEED AND POSITION.  DEEP MOISTURE IS LACKING 
WITH THIS S/WV.  HOWEVER...WITH PVA AND LOW LVL CONVERGENCE 
INDICATED BY 850-700 MB Q-VECTORS...BELIEVE SOME SCT -SHSN SHOULD 
DEVELOP.  WILL KEEP LOW 30 POP IN THE FCST.

ON THURSDAY...S/WV QUICKLY MOVES OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST. NVA AND WAA 
ALOFT BEGIN TO WORK ACRS THE REGION FROM WEST TO EAST.  ALTHOUGH WAA 
IS INDICATED...BELIEVE CLEARING WILL BE A SLOW PROCESS. MOSTLY 
CLOUDY WEST IN THE MORNING...THEN PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE AFTN LOOKS 
GOOD AT THIS TIME.  MOSTLY CLOUDY EAST FOR MOST OF THE DAY ALSO 
LOOKS LIKE THE WAY TO GO.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE COLD SIDE IN 
THE LOWER AND MID 20S.

SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR THURSDAY NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
INTO THE REGION.  NEXT SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION SOMETIME 
FRIDAY AFTN/EVENING.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE NEXT 
60 TO 72 HRS.  A SHARPENING UPPER LEVEL TROF WILL SWING ACROSS FA 
OVERNIGHT BRINGING -13/-14 850 TEMPS ALONG WITH FLOW OFF LAKE MI.  
THIS WILL CREATE LIGHT SNSH OR FLURRIES ACROSS FA OVERNIGHT.  THE

FEEL PRETTY CONFIDENT THAT CLOUDS WILL CLEAR TO SOME DEGREE AS

SHOWING MOISTURE BELOW 1000 FT DURING THE AFTERNOON.  BUT THIS TIME 
OF YEAR IT IS ALWAYS TOUGH.  SKIES WILL AT LEAST CLEAR OUT BY

06Z SFC ANALYSIS INDICATED A WEAK COLD FRONT/TROF EXTENDING FROM 
WISCONSIN SOUTHWEST INTO ERN IO AND NRN MO.

NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF WX EXPECTED TODAY WITH WEAK FRONT AS S/WV 
ACRS THE WRN GREAT LAKES ROTATES EAST AWAY FROM BOUNDARY.  SOME MID 
AND MAINLY HIGH CLOUDS WILL SPILL INTO THE REGION...PROVIDING FOR 
FILTERED SUNSHINE.  THUS...PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS SHOULD HOLD FOR 
MOST OF THE DAY.  THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS THE FAR NORTH WHERE HIGH 
CLOUDS COULD BE THICK ENOUGH FOR MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS.  WILL BE 
OPTIMISTIC ATTM.  THICKNESS SCHEMES INDICATE TEMPERATURES WILL 
GENERALLY BE UNIFORM OVER THE REGION.  SLIGHT VARIATIONS WILL BE THE 
RESULT OF HOW MUCH SUNSHINE GETS THROUGH CLOUDS.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK FRONT/TROF WASHES OUT OVER THE REGION.  UPR LVL 
FLOW BEGINS TO AMPLIFY AS MORE S/WV ENERGY DIGS SOUTHWARD FROM 
CANADA.  SKIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE MAINLY CLEAR OVERNIGHT...EXCEPT 
THE SRN CWFA WHERE CIRRUS STREAMING FROM SRN PLAINS STATES WILL KEEP 
SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY.

ALL MODELS HAVE BEEN TRENDING TOWARD A MORE DEEPER...SHARPER H5 
TROUGH ON WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY.  A BLEND OF THE AVN/ETA SOLUTION 
IS PROBABLY THE BEST WAY TO GO.  I BELIEVE MOST LOCATIONS WILL HAVE 
ABUNDANT SUNSHINE WEDNESDAY MORNING BEFORE LOW LEVEL CLOUDS BEGIN 
TO MOVE SOUTHEAST FROM THE GREAT LAKES.  COLD AIR OVER LAKE MICHIGAN 
MAY GENERATE A FEW SNOW FLURRIES ACRS THE NRN CWFA DURING THE AFTN.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...WITH S/WV ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE 
REGION COMBINED WITH SOME LAKE MSTR...THINK SOME SCATTERED SNOW 
SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP.  AS A RESULT...WILL INTRODUCE A CHC OF SNOW 
SHOWERS.  ON THURSDAY...WITH SLOWER H5 TROUGH...WILL BE MORE 
PESSIMISTIC WITH CLOUD CLOVER AS COLD POOL AT H85 WILL LINGER A

UPPER TROF DIGGING INTO NORTHERN MEXICO HAS BEGUN TO TURN FLOW ALOFT 
TO SOUTHWEST.  MODELS GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT THROUGH 48 HRS IN 
BRINGING TROF AXIS ROUGHLY FROM WISCONSIN TO LOUISIANA 00Z  
SATURDAY. 

SFC RIDGE IN PLACE WILL GIVE WAY TO INVERTED TROF BY THIS EVENING. 
MODELS DIVERGE IN LOCATION OF INVERTED TROF...WITH ETA AND CANADIAN 
POINTING TROF AT SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO AND AVN TAKING IT FARTHER EAST 
AROUND WEST VIRGINIA AT 06Z TONIGHT. 

PRECIP ALREADY OCCURRING IN TENNESSEE AHEAD OF DEVELOPING SFC TROF.  
ETA AND AVN DOING DECENT JOB WITH QPF WITH NGM TOO FAR SOUTH.  ETA 
AND AVN DIFFER WRT QPF IN RELATION TO POSITION OF SFC TROF...WITH 
AVN GIVING US MUCH LESS.  AVN GIVES QPF ONLY TO OUR SOUTH CENTRAL 
COUNTIES...WHILE THE ETA GIVES SOME QPF TO OUR WHOLE CWFA INCLUDING 
METRO AREAS.  SINCE UPPER SUPPORT STAYS WEST...AVN PROBABLY TOO FAR 
EAST WITH SFC TROF.  THEREFORE...WILL LEAN TOWARD ETA...WHICH STILL 
HAS LESS AND LATER QPF THAN ON EARLIER MODEL RUNS. 

WITH PRECIP FARTHER SOUTH AND SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS...WILL 
NEED TO ADJUST TODAYS FCST TO LOWER/DROP POPS ALL ZONES. WILL ALSO 
NEED TO LOWER POPS TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. FOR TODAY...WILL DROP POPS AT 
DAY CMH AND WAPAKONETA.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS LATE FOR RAIN AT 
CVG...WITH SCT -SHRA SOUTH CENTRAL. FOR TONIGHT...WILL GO WITH 
CHANCE AT CVG DAY AND CMH...WITH ALL SNOW AT DAY...RAIN CHANGING TO 
SNOW AT CVG AND CMH...AND RAIN LIKELY AT PORTSMOUTH.  ON FRIDAY 
CHANCE OF SNOW WILL WORK AT CVG CMH AND DAY...WITH RAIN LIKELY 
CHANGING TO SNOW DURING THE AFTERNOON AT PORTSMOUTH. 

FZRA IS NO LONGER INDICATED ON MODEL SOUNDINGS TODAY AND

TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE TO STAY NEARLY STEADY OR EXPERIENCE A SLOW 
DROP THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. THIS SLOW DROP WILL FALL 
INTO LINE WITH CURRENT FCST...SO NO CHANGES EXPECTED HERE TONIGHT. 
CLOUDY SKIES MAY SEE A BREAK OR TWO...MAINLY IN THE NORTHWEST WHERE 
A FEW BREAKS ALREADY IN CENTRAL INDIANA MAY INTRUDE. 

MAIN CONCERN IS IF PREICP WILL GET INTO SRN FCST AREA OVERNIGHT. 
INITIAL THOUGHT IS THAT MAYBE TOWARDS MORNING. WILL SEND UPDATE TO 
LOWER POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE IN SW OHIO...AND REMOVE MIDNIGHT WORDING 
IN SRN FCST AREA. MAIN THREAT FOR ANY PRECIP WILL BE LATE...AND 
MAINLY S OF OH RIVER.

WEAK WAVE EXPECTED TO BE ON SW BORDER OF FCST AREA BY 12Z...WITH 
SOME LIGHT PRECIP EXPECTED AHEAD OF IT. ATTM...IT LOOKS LIKE MID 
LEVEL CLOUDS MAY SEED LOWER CLOUD DECK TO PRODUCE SNOW...BUT CHANCE 
FOR LIGHT FZRA CANT BE RULED OUT IF DRY AIR IN BETWEEN HOLDS SWAY.

IN OTHER WORDS...ONLY MINOR CHANGES EXPECTED. PREVIOUS FCST LOOKS TO

WATER VAPOR INDICATES A HUGE TROF IN THE SW U.S.  VISIBLE SATELLITE 
IMAGERY SHOWING LOW CLOUDS ERODING FROM THE WEST WITH HIGHER CLOUDS 
STREAMING IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

COMPLICATED FORECAST WITH MODELS STILL NOT IN AGREEMENT.  THE ETA IS 
THE FARTHEST NORTH WITH SURFACE LOW WITH THE AVN A BIT FARTHER SOUTH 
WITH DEVELOPING STORM FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.  THE UKMET IS WEAKER 
WITH CYCLOGENISIS WITH THE MM5 SHOWING SURFACE LOW TRACKING THROUGH 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TO THE MID ATLANTIC.  IF ETA IS PERFECT PROG 
THEN BLIZZARD WARNINGS WOULD LIKELY BE NEEDED FOR AT LEAST SE 
PORTION OF FA.  NOT CONVINCED YET WITH OTHER MODELS FARTHER SOUTH 
AND THE TREND OF AVN AND ETA IS FOR A MORE SOUTHEASTERLY TRACK.

IN THE SHORTER TERM PRECIPITATION WILL SPREAD INTO FA LATE TONIGHT 
INTO THURSDAY WITH A WAVE WORKING IN THE BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW.  
CONCERNED ABOUT ONSET AS LOWS WILL GET BELOW FREEZING ACROSS FA AND 
WILL BE SLOW TO WARM ON THURSDAY.  PROGGED SOUNDINGS INDICATE SNOW 
AND/OR FREEZING RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE FROM THE INITIATION.  WILL 
HOLD OFF ON ADVISORY FOR NOW SINCE ONSET SHOULD WILL BE AFTER 12Z 
THU AND THE DURATION OF FZRA WILL LIKELY BE SHORT.  IN OTHER WORDS 
WILL LET MIDNIGHT SHIFT RESOLVE.

WILL CLOSE THE RANGE ON FWC TEMPERATURES PER EXPECTED CLOUD AND THE

EXPECT ABOUT THE SAME TONIGHT.  HOWEVER...SOME WEAK CAA AT SFC TO 
THE WEST MAY ALLOW TEMPS TO APCH MOS VALUES...PARTICULARLY IN THE 
WRN CWFA (DAY AND WAP).  WILL TAKE A GAMBLE AND GO ABOUT 2 TO 3

AS A DRY WEDGE NOTED FROM 850 MB TO 700 MB TOMORROW SPELL LITTLE IN 
THE WAY OF PCPN FOR THE REGION.  HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE NRN 2/3 OF

925 MB AND 850 MB.  IT EJECTS ONE IMPULSE INTO KY BY THURSDAY 
MORNING...THEN IT HEADS NE INTO WEST VA.  LOOKS LIKE WAA PATTERN 
SETTING UP ALONG WITH THE LOW LVL CONVERGENCE ASSOCD WITH THE JET 
WILL BRING A THREAT OF RAIN TO THE SRN CWFA ON THURSDAY.  THE FAR 
NORTH SHOULD REMAIN DRY.  THERE IS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE THE PCPN MAY 
BEGIN AS A LITTLE IP OR FZRA IN THE SOUTH...BUT WILL BANK THAT TEMPS 
WILL WARM UP TO FREEZING BEFORE ONSET OF ANY PCPN IN THE SOUTH.
WENT ALONG WITH THE MAV TEMPS FOR THURSDAY DESPITE THICKNESS SCHEME 
SHOWING MAINLY LOWER TO MID 40S EVERYWHERE.  THE ETA SHOWS MORE OF A

WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL PERSIST FOR ABOUT THE NEXT 1.5 DAYS. FLOW 
WILL BACK TO SOUTHWEST ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS TROF DIGS INTO SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES.

UPPER FLOW IS PULLING SFC RIDGE INTO OHIO VALLEY. RIDGE WILL PERSIST 
UNTIL INVERTED SFC TROF MOVES TOWARD THE REGION AHEAD OF WESTERN 
UPPER TROF ON WEDNESDAY. IT WILL STAY CLOUDY TODAY AS RIDGE IS NOT 
STRONG ENOUGH TO ERODE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. MODELS INDICATE DRYING AT 
850 MB TONIGHT WITH MOISTURE PERSISTING AT 925 MB AND INCREASING 
LATE AT UPPER LEVELS...SO ILL CONTINUE MOSTLY CLOUDY FCST.

MODELS KEEP MOISTURE AT 925 MB ON WEDNESDAY...WITH MID AND UPPER 
LEVEL MOISTURE STILL AROUND AHEAD OF INVERTED TROF. DRIER AIR 
BETWEEN 50-70 PERCENT RH IS PROGGED FROM 4 TO 9 KFT. MOST OF UPWARD 
MOTION IS INDICATED FROM ABOUT 15 TO 30 KFT...WITH CONFLUENCE AT 500 
MB RESULTING IN DOWNWARD MOTION. 

ALL IN ALL...MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE 
A LOT OF PRECIP ON WEDNESDAY. ETA QPF GIVES OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES A 
COUPLE HUNDREDTHS WITH OTHER AREAS DRY. WILL KEEP CLOUDY FCST FOR 
WEDNESDAY...WITH CHANCE FLURRIES NORTH AND 30 POP CHANCE LIGHT SNOW 
SOUTH.

FWC TEMPS LOOK PRETTY GOOD FOR TODAY. WILL STAY RIGHT AROUND 35 AT 
CVG AND CMH...AND JUST A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE FWCS 32 AT DAY. WITH 
CLOUDS AROUND FWC LOOKS TOO WARM FOR TONIGHT. WILL STAY AROUND 
PREVIOUS FCSTS MID TO UPPER 20S...CLOSE TO MESOETA SFC TEMPS AND 
ABOUT 3 DEGREES ABOVE FWCS 22-25. ON WEDNESDAY...WILL AGAIN STAY 
NEAR FWC FOR HIGHS IN LOW TO MID 30S. WILL ADJUST WEDNESDAY NIGHTS 
LOWS UPWARD NEAR FWC (IN LINE WITH MESOETA) AS CLOUDS AND SOUTHERLY 
SFC FLOW WILL PROBABLY KEEP TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 20S.

MEANWHILE...A MORE WELL DEFINED S/WV (VORTICITY MAX) WAS LOCATED OVR

FOR OUR CWFA.  THIS S/WV WILL MOVE ACRS THE SRN GREAT LAKES 
TONIGHT...THEN INTO NE OH/NW PA BY TUESDAY MORNING.  AS OF NOW...WL 
DOWN PLAY THE WX WITH THIS SYSTEM AS LOW LVL FORCING IS ALMOST 
NEGLIGENT.  THUS...WILL MENTION A SML CHC OF SNOW SHOWERS OR 
FLURRIES IN MY MOST NRN AND ERN ZONES...CLOSER TO THE TRACK OF THE 
S/WV.  OTHERWISE...SKIES WILL REMAIN CLOUDY IN A CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT.
TEMPS WILL SLOWLY DROP INTO THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S OVERNIGHT.

FOR TUESDAY...THE OHIO VALLEY WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF 
CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT.  THIS IS NOT FAVORABLE FOR MUCH WX...IN TERMS 
OF PCPN.  HOWEVER...SKIES WILL BE CLOUDY AS LOW LVL MSTR WILL BE 
HARD PRESSED TO SCOUR OUT OF THE AREA.  THERE WILL BE A SMALL 
DIURNAL CHANGE FROM OVERNIGHT LOWS TO TUESDAY/S HIGHS.

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...ALL MODELS...INCLUDING THE 
AVN...ARE NOW IN LINE WITH THE NRN JET STREAM S/WV APCHING THE GREAT

SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES.  BEFORE...THE AVN WAS MUCH SLOWER AND 
THUS DEEPER WITH THE NRN JET STREAM S/WV.  NOW...IT HAS COME MORE IN

SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCED THE POSSIBILITY OF A GENEROUS SNOWFALL FOR THE

CONTINUES ACRS THE REGION.  AS A RESULT...AS THE SRN STREAM S/WV

IN THE EXTENDED...THE AVN ONCE AGAIN TRIES TO DIG A SIGNIFICANT S/WV

THIS SCENARIO WOULD DEVELOP A GOOD SNOWFALL FOR THE MIDDLE AND ERN

FOR SATURDAY LOOKS GOOD.  TEMPS SHOULD REBOUND NICELY...RANGING FROM 
40 TO 45 FAR NORTH AND AROUND 50 FAR SOUTH.

AS THE AFOREMENTIONED H5 TROUGH MOVES INTO THE CNTRL PLAINS SATURDAY 
NIGHT...MID AND HIGH CLOUDS WILL EJECT NE INTO THE REGION.  MID 
CLOUDS SHOULD PREVENT A BIG TEMPERATURE DROP...AND THIS IS REFLECTED 
IN THE OVERNIGHT LOWS.

ON SUNDAY...SHOWERS WILL MOVE OUT AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT INTO THE

AS UPR LVL VORTICITY BECOMES SHEARED.  SO...BEST CHANCE OF RAIN

...ORIGINAL DISCUSSION...

DUEL SHORTWAVES CONTINUE THEIR TREK TOWARD THE FA.  ANALYSIS OF 12Z 
500 MB SHOWED THAT THE NORTHERN SYSTEM STILL HAD ITS STRONGEST WINDS 
ON THE WEST SIDE...THEREFORE THE SYSTEM SHOULD DIG A LITTLE FARTHER 
SOUTH.  AS IT DOES...THE TWO SYSTEMS KIND OF MERGE TO THE SOUTH OF 
THE FA ON FRIDAY.  BIG QUESTION IS WHETHER OR NOT THE PCPN ACROSS 
IL/IN/KY WILL PUSH INTO SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FA TONIGHT.  MODELS 
CONTINUE TO SHOW VERY DRY LOW LEVELS...WHICH WOULD INHIBIT PCPN.  
HOWEVER THE ETA AND MESO-ETA CONTINUE TO BE CONSISTENT IN PUSHING 
THE PCPN INTO THE FA.  AT 18Z...THE ETA/MESO-ETA HAD THE BEST HANDLE 
ON THE POSITION OF THE QPF FIELD. THEREFORE WILL INTRODUCE A MENTION 
OF PCPN IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FA. ACROSS NORTHERN KY INTO 
SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO...WILL GO WITH CHANCE POPS AND IN CVG TO 
CHILLICOTHE WILL GO WITH SPRINKLES.

NOW THAT I HAVE MENTIONED PCPN...WHAT TYPE TO FORECAST. SOUNDINGS 
ARE SHOWING A VERY DEEP LOW LEVEL WARM LAYER...ALMOST 4-5K FEET. 
HOWEVER I AM PLANNING TO GO WITH LOWS EITHER AROUND 30 OR IN THE 
LOWER 30S...SO WILL MENTION RAIN AND FREEZING RAIN. SO I WILL BE 
GOING WITH LOW POP...WILL NOT ISSUE WSW ATTM.

ALTHOUGH SOME HIGHER RH LINGERS INTO FRIDAY...THE BEST LIFT PULLS TO 
THE EAST WITH THE UPPER SYSTEM...SO WILL GO DRY ON FRIDAY...WITH 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOK IN THE BALL PARK.

500 MB SHORTWAVE RIDGE BUILDS IN ON SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES COULD GET 
SNEAKY WARM...BUT THINK THAT THE NGM NUMBERS ARE A LITTLE TOO WARM.

THE OTHER SYSTEM IS A WEAKENING COLD FRONT SWINGING DOWN FROM THE

WELL.

WILL GO WITH MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND MOSTLY 
SUNNY ON WEDNESDAY. ON THURSDAY...MOSTLY SUNNY WITH INCREASING 
AFTERNOON CLOUDS WILL WORK.

AS FOR TEMPS...THOUGH FWC HAS IMPROVED WRT REALITY SINCE 
YESTERDAY...IT STILL APPEARS GENERALLY TOO HIGH. WITH LOW DEW POINTS 
AND LIGHTER WINDS TONIGHT...I WILL UNDERCUT FWCS 17-19 DOWN TO THE 
13-16 RANGE...SPLITTING THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN FWC AND MESOETA SFC 
TEMPS. WITH MESOETA INDICATING TEMPS ABOUT 10 DEGREES BELOW 
FWC...WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND UNDERCUT FWC FOR THE REST OF THE

304 PM EST MON JAN 8 2001

GENERAL PATTERN OF THIS WINTER CONTINUES WITH UPPER TROF ACROSS 
EASTERN CONUS. A SHIFT IN THE PATTERN WILL OCCUR BY LATER THIS WEEK 
AS PACIFIC STORMS WILL PUSH RIDGE INTO OUR REGION.

SFC MAP HAS LOW ALONG EAST COAST AND LARGE HIGH ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF 
THE CONUS. HIGH IS PROGGED TO BECOME CENTERED SOUTH OF HERE BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT AFTER UPPER TROF AXIS PASSES EAST. WITH INFLUENCE OF 
MASSIVE SLOW MOVING HIGH...LITTLE OR NO PRECIP IS IN STORE FOR THE 
NEXT TWO DAYS AT LEAST.

OUR AREA IS EXPERIENCING COLD ADVECTION THIS AFTERNOON IN THE 
NORTHERLY FLOW BETWEEN SYSTEMS. FLOW IS KEEPING MOST OF LAKE 
MOISTURE WEST AND EAST OF OUR AREA...THE EXCEPTION BEING FLURRIES 
NEAR CMH.  ETA INDICATES THAT NORTHERLY FLOW WILL  CONTINUE TONIGHT 
SO WILL GO WITH CLEARING/PARTLY CLOUDY...WITH SCATTERED FLURRIES AT 
CMH AND PMH IN MINIMAL LAKE EFFECT. 850 MB WINDS WILL SHIFT TO WEST 
ON TUESDAY AND MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW INVERSION AT AROUND 1 
KFT...WHICH SHOULD END THE CHANCE FOR LAKE CLOUDS AND FLURRIES. 

SHORT WAVE PASSING NORTH OF HERE ON TUESDAY IS FCST TO DRAG MID 
LEVEL MOISTURE THROUGH. THIS FEATURE WILL PROBABLY NOT BRING ENOUGH 
MOISTURE THIS FAR SOUTH TO MAKE MORE THAN SCT AC. THEREFORE WILL 
KEEP MOSTLY SUNNY FCST FOR TUESDAY. WILL FOLLOW WITH MOSTLY CLEAR 
TUESDAY NIGHT/MOSTLY SUNNY WEDNESDAY AS HIGH BECOMES ESTABLISHED 
SOUTH OF HERE.

TEMP FCST IS A PROBLEM WITH MODELS NOT IN AGREEMENT. FWC IS 
GENERALLY QUITE A BIT WARMER THAN ETA SFC TEMPS THROUGH THE FCST 
PERIOD. FOR TONIGHT ETA SHOWS SLUG OF VERY COLD AIR DROPPING DOWN 
FROM MICHIGAN...WITH TEMPS RANGING FROM NEAR ZERO IN OUR NORTHWEST 
COUNTIES TO AROUND 15 FAR SOUTH. FWC HAS 15-17 FOR LOWS. WILL STAY 
NEAR FWC AT CVG WHERE COLD DRY AIR WILL HAVE MORE TROUBLE ADVECTING 
IN. WILL ALSO STAY NEAR FWC AT CMH WHERE A FEW MORE CLOUDS SHOULD 
HELP TO KEEP TEMPS UP SLIGHTLY. WILL GO BELOW FWC BY A FEW AT DAY 
WITH COLD AIR MORE LIKELY TO REACH THERE.

WITH ETA SHOWING TEENS FOR HIGHS ON TUESDAY AND THERMAL TROF 
CENTERED HERE...WILL UNDERCUT FWCS 27-29 INTO THE 20 TO 25 RANGE. 
AGAIN...ETA IS MUCH LOWER THAN FWC TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. WITH 
CLEAR SKIES...I EXPECT WE WILL DROP BELOW FWCS 22-25 TO NEAR 20 
TUESDAY NIGHT. MILDER TEMPS ARE LIKELY ON WEDNESDAY AS HIGH 
CONTINUES SLOWLY EAST. STILL...FWCS 45-49 APPEAR TOO OPTIMISTIC AND 
SO WILL GO 35 TO 40...CLOSE TO MAV.

FCST PROBLEMS ARE CONCENTRATING ON NEXT CLIPPER SYSTEM WITH S/W 
MOVING THROUGH NRN GT LKS RGN OVERNIGHT FRIDAY. BROAD AREA OF 
INCREASED WIND SPEEDS WILL INCREASE WAA IN LOWER LEVELS STARTING 
LATE IN THE DAY.

PRECIP EFFICIENCIES ARE ONLY SHOWING A BRIEF PERIOD OF SHOWERS...AND 
RIGHT NOW IT COULD BE SNOW AND FZRA MIX...ESPECIALLY FOR SRN 2/3 OF 
FCST AREA. DRIER...WARMER MID LEVELS WOULD/COULD PRECLUDE SNOW

MOTION REALLY GETS GOING IN STRONGER WINDS. TIMING OF PRECIP LOOKS 
TO BE WITH ENHANCED UVV AND VORT...AN HOUR OR THREE ON EITHER SIDE

NEXT DAY OR SO UNDER HIGH PRESSURE UNTIL NEXT S/W PASSES NORTH OF 
FCST AREA ON WED AFTERNOON/EVENING. MODEL QPF FROM THIS SYSTEM IS ON 
LIGHT SIDE AND DRY AIR IN PLACE WITH HIGH PRESSURE TODAY MAKES A 
LIGHT SNOW EVENT LOOK REASONABLE. SOME FORCING EXPECTED AHEAD OF 
WEAK SFC TROF...WHICH GETS WASHED OUT OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY WITH 
RIDGING RIGHT BEHIND THE TROF. CURRENT FCST HAS THIS IN HAND WITH 
CHANCE POPS EVERYWHERE...HIGHEST IN WEST CENTRAL OHIO. EXPECT TO

RIGHT NOW...ETA AND AVN HAVE POSSIBILITY OF AN INCH OR SO IN CENTRAL 
OHIO...WILL MENTION ACCUMS POSSIBLE. REST OF CWA SHOULD BE FAIRLY

NEXT SYSTEM IS A STRONG LOW PUSHING INTO HUDSON BAY ON FRIDAY...WITH

ON FRIDAY. MODELS ATTM HINTING AT POSSIBILITY OF A MIX...AND CURRENT 
FCST IS WELL IN HAND WITH RAIN/SNOW POSSIBLE.

MORNING...MOS WOULD BE TOO COOL. RIGHT NOW...STATIONS ACROSS FCST 
AREA ARE AT 20...BUT MIE DROPPED 7 DEGREES IN AN HOUR WITH CLEARING
