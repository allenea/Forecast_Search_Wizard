THANKS LVX AND IND FOR COORD ON HEADLINES FOR THEIR AREAS

AM NOT CONVINCED THAT RAIN WITH NEAR FREEZING TEMPS IN NRN CWA WILL 
BE FREEZING RAIN TOMORROW. BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE TOO MOIST FROM 
CURRENT PRECIP TO ACCOMPLISH A FREEZE AT THE SURFACE. MODELS STILL 
HAVENT COME TO A SOLUTION THAT IS AGREEABLE HERE. AM FORECASTING 
CHANCE POPS IN THE FAR NW WITH ZR PREDOMINANT WX. REST OF NRN FCST 
AREA HAS LIKELY R WITH CHANCE ZR...ALL R SOUTH. 

INITIAL SHOT OF PRECIP WED SHOULD EXIT EAST LATER IN THE AFTERNOON 
FOR MOST OF CWA. STILL FEEL THAT ETAS WARM CONVEYOR IS TOO MOIST 
AND THAT THERED BE A CUTOFF OF MOISTURE BETWEEN UPPER SYSTEMS AT 
THIS TIME. HAVE KEPT PRECIP TO A MINIMUM FOR THE NEXT 2 NIGHTS BUT 
HAVE LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS FOR DAYTIME PERIODS ENTIRE CWA WITH 
EXCEPTION OF CHANCE IN THE FAR NW TOMORROW. 

THE CHANGEOVER NEVER OCCURS IF YOU FOLLOW THE ETA. HAVE TRIED TO 
MAINTAIN A CONSISTENT FORECAST AND NOT FLIP-FLOP AROUND TOO MUCH. 
WILL START THURS WITH A R/S MIX AND THEN CHANGE TO ALL SNOW IN THE 
AFTERNOON FOR NW 1/2. ONLY HAVE CHANCE POPS IN THE SE DURING THE DAY 
AND EXPECT PRECIP TO BE LIKELY HERE WITH A MIX OVERNIGHT THURS AND A 
CHANGE TO SNOW LATE. REST OF FCST AREA WILL HAVE LIKELY SNOW. 

HAVE NOT CHANGED TOO MUCH IN TEMPS...AFTER CDFNT TODAY...READINGS 
SHOULD BE FAIRLY STEADY FOR MUCH OF FCST AREA FOR NEXT DAY OR 
TWO...WARMEST IN THE SE. 

FOR THE EXTENDED...WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE LAST FEW DAYS NEAR 
CLIMO WITH THE THOUGHT OF A BROAD H5 TROF OVER THE GTLKS. THIS WILL 
HAMPER ANY WARMING THROUGH THE COLUMN...BUT MRF SUGGESTING AT A 
STRONG WARM LLVL PUSH AHEAD OF A SFC LOW ON SUNDAY. THE SFC LOW 
UNDER THE H5 SOUNDS REASONABLE BUT WILL EXPECT THE AMS TO BE A BIT 
COOLER THAN MODEL FCST SINCE THE MID LEVEL FLOW AHEAD OF THIS SFC 
PUNCH IS FAIRLY STRONG FROM THE NW. RIGHT NOW...SUN WILL BE THE 
WARMEST DAY WITH HIGHS REACHING AROUND 40 TO THE SE. MON AND TUES 
WILL EXPECT HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 30S...PM LOWS IN THE 20S...AND A 
CHANCE OF SNOW SUN AND TUES DUE TO PROXIMITY OF H5 LOW(S). MRF 
SHOWING A BREAK ON MONDAY AND WILL CUT BACK PRECIP HERE. 

WITH REGARDS TO WINTER WX AND FLOODING POTENTIAL...DO NOT FEEL THE 
PRECIP WILL BE THERE FOR MUCH OF TONIGHT AS IT GETS PUSHED S FROM 
THE CDFNT. AM NOT CONVINCED HOW COLD THE AIR WILL BE TO WARRANT ZR 
ADVY IN THE N TOMORROW...CONSIDERING I THINK PRECIP WILL START A BIT

01Z SFC ANALYSIS INDCG COLD FRNT EXTNDG FROM DEEP SFC LO NORTH OF LK 
SUPERIOR SOUTH THROUGH WESTERN GRT LKS TO STRENGTHENING SFC LO IN 
ARKLATEX.  GFS HAS INITIALIZED BEST AT 00Z WITH ETA PLACING SFC LO 
TOO FAR SOUTH...AND WILL THUS TREND TOWARDS GFS SOLN FOR UPDATE.

TWO MAIN FCST ISSUES FOR UPDATE THIS EVNG...PCPN AND TEMPS.  -SHRA 
CONTINUES TO TRACK NE AND WEAKEN ACRS SOUTH CNTRL OH AND NE KENTUCKY 
ATTM.  EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE OVER NEXT FEW HRS AS LO LVL 
CONVERGENCE AND LIFT WEAKENS THRU 06Z.  FOCUS THEN SHIFTS TO PCPN 
AREA RAPIDLY EXPANDING NE ACRS LWR OH VALLEY.  BOTH ETA/GFS NOT 
INCREDIBLY IMPRESSIVE IN LO LVL CONVERGENCE VALUES...BUT GFS INDCG 
INCREASE IN UVV INTO FCST AREA BTWN 06-12Z.  AXIS OF BEST PCPN EFF 
VALUES EXTENDS INTO FCST AREA AFT 06Z ON BOTH GFS/ETA.

TAKING THIS ALL INTO ACCOUNT ALONG WITH RECENT RADAR TRENDS...WILL 
REINTRODUCE 50 POPS SHRA AFT MIDNITE/LATE ACRS WAPOK/DAY/CMH 
ZONES...AND 60 POPS ACRS CVG/N KY ZONES.  ACRS SE COUNTIES...WILL

ACRS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS CURRENTLY.  INSTABILITY AXIS IN THIS REGION 
SHIFTS NE INTO FCST AREA OVERNIGHT BUT WEAKENS.  WILL CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR...BUT NOT PLACING TSTMS IN FCST ATTM. 

NEXT ISSUE INVOLVES TEMPS OVERNIGHT.  BELIEVE CURRENT FCST LOWS NEED 
TO BE RAISED FOR A COUPLE OF REASONS.  FIRST...MOIST SWATH OF 50+ 
DEWPT AIR EXTNDG ACRS MUCH OF INDIANA AND EASTERN ILLINOIS AND 
POKING INTO OUR WESTERN FCST AREA.  THIS MOIST AIR WILL SHIFT INTO 
FCST AREA OVERNIGHT WITH EXPANDING PCPN AREA.  SECOND...BOTH GFS/ETA 
INDCG FRNTL BNDRY MAY REACH NW COUNTIES BTWN 09-12Z... AND 30S DEWPT 
AIR CURRENTLY 100-200 MILES BEHIND FRNT.  WILL RAISE TEMPS

EXPECT TO DROP POPS FROM LIKELY TONIGHT TO SCATTERED - SLIGHT 
CHANCE IN THE SOUTHEAST. WILL WAIT UNTIL ISSUANCE TO SEE IF ACTIVITY 
DROPS OFF THIS PM AS EXPECTED, OTHERWISE WILL KEEP A LIKELY PERIOD 
EARLY IF SHOWERS WILL BE ONGOING AT 0Z. FOCUS FOR THIS ACTIVITY WILL 
BE LIMITED TO A STRETCHED VORT EXTENDING SW-NE OVER FCST AREA AND 
INCREASED OMEGA FIELDS. MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IS BEST TODAY...ALONG 
WITH THE VORT AND OMEGA FIELDS. THESE ARE DUE TO A LLJET WHICH IS 
RAPIDLY MOVING NE. SOUTHERN EDGE OF A LOW N OF THE GTLKS AND ITS 
ASSOCIATED CDFNT ARE EXPECTED TO HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING A 
PROGRESSION SOUTHWARD. FRONT GETS STRETCHED OVER FCST AREA AND 
MAINTAINS A FOCUS FOR ENHANCED MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND PRECIP FOR 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 

CURRENT TREND OF MODELS AND PREVIOUS FORECASTS IS TO DISCOUNT ETAS 
SOLUTION WITH THE UPCOMING SRN STREAM SYSTEM ON WED. LOOKING AT 
DPROG/DT AT 12Z TUE...BOTH ETA AND AVN HANDLE NRN SYSTEM WELL. AVN 
IS CONSISTENT IN STRENGTH AND PLACEMENT OF SRN ENERGY. ETA SLOWS 
DOWN THE H5 LOW AND SFC LOW QUITE A BIT. SW PROGRESSION IN TIME WITH 
MODEL RUNS IS SIGNIFICANT...ABOUT 400 NM AT THE SFC AND 275 NM FOR 
H5. THIS SIGNIFICANT SLOWING OF THE ETA MODEL WITH EACH RUN IS BAD. 
WILL CONTINUE TO TREND FCST TOWARDS QUICKER AND WETTER GFS SOLUTION 
WHICH IS SUPPORTED BY UKMET. CANADIAN IS ODD-MODEL-OUT LOOKING AT 
ITS SOLUTION FOR 0Z THURS - WAY TOO STRONG ON SFC LOW AND AT THE 
EAST COAST VERSUS SOMEWHERE IN THE OHVLY. 

EVEN IF ETA IS CORRECT, RAIN WILL NOT BE OCCURRING UNTIL LATE DAY 
WED AND OVERNIGHT. THE WAY IM PLAYING IT NOW...WILL HAVE FZRA 
PREDOMINANT IN THE FAR NW AND ONLY HAVE A POSSIBILITY FOR NW 
PORTIONS OF USUAL DAY AND CMH ZONE GROUPINGS. REST OF CWA PLAIN 
RAIN. 

ODD STUFF HAPPENING AT THIS TIME IN THE FCST. H7 STRETCHED OUT LOW 
HANGS OVER NRN OHVLY AND MAINTAINS A CONNECTION WITH SECOND S/W IN 
THE MIDWEST ON BOTH MODELS. MODELS DONT COME INTO AGREEMENT ON 
SYSTEM EXPECTED TO BE OVER FCST AREA ON THURS PM. EITHER MODEL WILL 
BE SNOW...BUT ETA IS JUST TOO FAR OVERDONE IN BRINGING IN ATLANTIC 
MOISTURE AS FAR W AS EASTERN KANSAS EARLIER IN THE DAY. SIG SNOW 
POSSIBLE NW OF FCST AREA THURS PM...WILL HAVE LIKELY SNOW MENTIONED 
ACROSS MOST IF NOT ALL OF F.A. BUT KEEP MENTION OF ACCUM OUT SINCE 
ITS SO FAR OUT AND MODELS ARE NOT CONSISTENT TO RESOLVE THIS 
SITUATION. PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS ON QPF WITH 
THURS NIGHT SYSTEM AND WILL RUN WITH THIS THINKING. 

DONT EXPECT EXTENDED TO BE CLOSE TO RIGHT WITH THIS MUCH PLAY IN 
THE SHORT TERM. WILL EXTRAPOLATE PREVIOUS FCST AND HAVE CHANCE POPS 
SUN AND MON. PRECIP TYPE TO BE FCST AS SNOW. GUIDANCE IS WARMING UP 
ATMOSPHERE BUT IM GOING TO HAVE HIGHS A BIT COOLER...MID 30S AND 
KEEP PTYPE AS ALL FROZEN SINCE THERE IS SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY.

WARM FRONT WAS ASSOCD WITH A STRONG 850 MB LOW LVL JET.  THE LOW 
LEVEL CONV ASSOCD WITH THIS JET IS RESPONSIBLE FOR ONGOING SHOWER 
ACTIVITY ACRS THE CWFA.  MODELS SHOW THAT THIS CONVERGENCE WILL 
WEAKEN AS THE DAY PROGRESSES INTO THE AFTN HOURS (AND AS THE WARM 
FRONT MOVES NE)  THUS...SHOWERS SHOULD BECOME MORE SCATTERED IN 
NATURE BY THEN IN THE WARM SECTOR.  RADAR TRENDS HAVE BEEN SHOWING A 
SHIFT IN THE PCPN TOWARD THE EAST.  THE CMH AND PMH REGIONS WILL BE 
THE LAST ONES OUT OF THE WIDESPREAD PCPN.  MODELS ARE SHOWING 
SLIGHT INSTABILITY FOR THIS AFTN.  HOWEVER...GIVEN LACK OF STRONG 
LOW LVL CONV AND NO REAL STRONG DISTURBANCE ALOFT...AM DOUBTFUL

UNSETTLED WEEK SHAPING UP FOR THE OHIO VALLEY AS SEVERAL SYSTEMS 
IMPACT THE AREA. FIRST THING TO DEAL WITH IS PRECIPITATION FOR 
TODAY. SHOWERS NEAR THE NOSE OF THE LOW LEVEL JET ARE ALREADY MOVING 
INTO THE WESTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. THESE SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING. BELIEVE COVERAGE SHOULD BE 
LESS THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING. WILL THEN PUSH PROBABILITIES 
BACK UP TO LIKELY FOR LATE TONIGHT WITH THE APPROACH OF A COLD FRONT 
AND A WEAK SHORT WAVE.

LOOKS LIKE FRONT WILL BARELY MAKE IT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON 
TUESDAY WITH A TEMPORARY DRYING OUT. HOWEVER ENERGETIC SOUTHERN 
STREAM SYSTEM WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND PASSING BY ON WEDNESDAY. THIS FOLLOWS THE GFS SOLUTION WHICH HAS 
SUPPORT FROM THE UNITED KINGDOM AND EUROPEAN MODELS. THE ETA JUST 
SEEMS MUCH TOO FAR SOUTH AND TOO SLOW WITH THIS ENERGY. 

SO EXPECT A SHIELD OF RAIN TO SPREAD BACK NORTH INTO THE AREA 
DURING THE LATTER HALF OF TUESDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE ON WEDNESDAY. 
THIS COULD LEAD TO A PRECIPITATION TYPE PROBLEM. GOING ALONG WITH 
THE WARMER GFS SOLUTION IT LOOKS LIKE SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
ABOVE FREEZING WHERE RAIN OCCURS TUESDAY NIGHT. FAR NORTHWEST ZONES 
ARE EXPECTED TO FALL BELOW FREEZING BUT DO NOT BELIEVE RAIN WILL 
SPREAD THAT FAR NORTH DURING THE NIGHT. HOWEVER AS PRECIPITATION 
DOES MOVE INTO THAT AREA TEMPERATURES MAY STILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO 
HAVE A PERIOD OF FREEZING RAIN ON WEDNESDAY MORNING BEFORE 
CHANGING TO RAIN AS TEMPERATURES SLOWLY RISE. 

NEXT SYSTEM WILL QUICKLY FOLLOW ON THURSDAY. BY THAT TIME ATMOSPHERE 
WILL HAVE COOLED THROUGHOUT THE COLUMN TO SUPPORT SNOW. BUT MOISTURE 
LOOKS RATHER LIMITED SO AMOUNTS SHOULD NOT BE MUCH.

MODELS COMING INTO GENERAL AGREEMENT IN SHOWING LONG WAVE TROUGH 
SPLITTING INTO ENERGETIC NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAMS. MAIN PLAYER 
FOR THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE THE SOUTHERN SYSTEM. WHILE THERE ARE 
SOME TIMING AND PLACEMENT DIFFERENCES IT APPEARS THAT THE GFS 
SOLUTION WOULD BE CLOSE TO AN ENSEMBLE AVERAGE OF THE VARIOUS 
MODELS. SO HAVE LEANED TOWARDS THAT.

LOW CLOUDS THAT HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT INTO THE NORTHERN 
PART OF THE FORECAST AREA ALONG WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF MID LEVEL 
MOISTURE STREAMING EASTWARD SHOULD KEEP NORTHERN SECTIONS MOSTLY 
CLOUDY TODAY. BUT EXPECT THE SOUTH TO JUST HAVE SOME MID AND HIGH 
CLOUDS THAT WILL CLEAR OUT AS THE DAY PROGRESSES.

WARM FRONT WILL LIFT NORTH ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT WITH A GOOD SURGE 
OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. SO LOW CLOUDS SHOULD SPREAD BACK ACROSS THE 
REGION LATE TONIGHT. IN ADDITION LIFT ALONG THE NOSE OF THE LOW 
LEVEL JET COULD RESULT IN SOME SHOWERS AND WILL INCLUDE A LOW CHANCE 
PROBABILITY IN THE WEST. 

EXPECT THIS PRECIPITATION TO EXPAND IN COVERAGE AND SPREAD ACROSS 
THE ENTIRE AREA DURING THE MORNING AS AN UPPER DISTURBANCE MOVES 
NORTHEAST AND THUS HAVE BUMPED PROBABILITY UP TO LIKELY FOR MONDAY. 
FORCING LOOKS LIKE IT DIMINISHES FOR THE AFTERNOON BUT INSTABILITY 
INCREASES. SO WILL KEEP AT LEAST A CHANCE GOING IN THE AFTERNOON AND 
INCLUDE A MENTION OF THUNDER.

BEST CHANCE OF RAIN LOOKS TO BE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS FRONT 
SLOWLY MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ALONG THIS 
BOUNDARY WILL PASS TO THE SOUTH AND THIS MAY AFFECT THE INFLOW OF 
MOISTURE THIS FAR NORTH. BUT NONETHELESS THERE SHOULD BE GOOD 
COVERAGE OF SHOWERS. COULD BE SOME LINGERING RAIN ON TUESDAY NIGHT 
AS THE SURFACE LOW MOVES OFF THE EAST COAST BUT AT THIS TIME IT 
APPEARS THAT PRECIPITATION WILL END BEFORE THERE COULD BE ANY CHANGE 
IN PRECIPITATION TYPE.

TEMPERATURES ARE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE AS THERE WILL LIKELY BE 
NON-DIURNAL TRENDS BOTH TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. HAVE NOT STRAYED TOO 
FAR FROM THE MAV NUMBERS FOR HIGHS. BUT IN GENERAL HAVE GONE A FEW

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES DEVELOPING SURFACE TROF OVER IN/WESTERN 
OHIO.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO STRENGTHENING WAVE MOVING IN THE 
NORTHWEST FLOW.  BEST MOISTURE IS TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF FA WHICH 
IS WHERE BEST THREAT OF SNOW IS.  KILN RADAR SHOWING BETTER RETURNS 
MOVING INTO THE NORTH AND LAPS SOUNDING OVER MERCER COUNTY SHOWING 
ATMOSPHERE ALMOST SATURATED.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CONDITIONS 
SLOWLY IMPROVING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST ACROSS THE REGION.

MODELS ARE ALL IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH 48 TO 60 
HOURS...THEN THEY DIVERGE.  THE ETA IS THE ODD MODEL OUT WITH A 
WEAKER SOUTHERN JET WHICH ALLOWS THE SYSTEM FOR EARLY IN THE WEEK TO 
BE MORE PROGRESSIVE.  THE GFS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT AND HAS BEEN 
CONTINUALLY CATCHING UP WITH THE UKMET AND ECMWF WITH THIS SYSTEM.  
THE UKMET AND GFS ARE VERY SIMILAR BUT WILL TREND TOWARDS THE SLOWER 
UKMET SOLUTION.  THANKFULLY THIS DOES NOT RELATE MUCH TO THE 
FORECAST EXCEPT IN BRINGING AN END TO PRECIP LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY.  HAVE CONTEMPLATED AN ESF ACROSS THE WEST AND SOUTH FOR 
THE EVENT WITH CURRENT FFG AROUND OR BELOW AND INCH FOR ONE HOUR AND 
AROUND OR BELOW 2 INCHES FOR 3 AND 6 HOURS.  SNOW SHOULD BE MAINLY 
GONE BUT GROUND WILL BE SATURATED IN THE MIAMI AND WHITE WATER 
VALLEY.  PWS WILL RISE TO AROUND AN INCH FOR THE EVENT WHICH WILL BE 
CLOSE TO 300% OF NORMAL.  QUESTION IS THE TRACK OF THE SECONDARY LOW 
THAT DEVELOPS IN THE GULF COAST STATES AND WILL CONVECTION TO THE 
SOUTH TAKE AWAY FROM OUR PRECIP.  WILL LET LATTER SHIFTS DEAL WITH 
THE INITIAL ISSUANCE SINCE STILL TOO MANY QUESTIONS.  IF THE AVN IS 
CLOSE TO LOW STRENGTH AND TRACK THEN THUNDER MAY BE POSSIBLE WITH 
ELEVATED LIS APPROACHING ZERO.  WILL LEAVE OUT FOR THE MOMENT BUT 
MAY NEED TO BE ADDED LATTER. 

IN THE SHORTER TERM SKIES WILL CLEAR ACROSS FA THROUGH MIDNIGHT WITH 
ONLY SOME HIGH CLOUDS EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY.  CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE 
INCREASE SUNDAY NIGHT AS MOISTURE FROM THE GULF WORKS UP INTO OHIO.  
MAV TEMPS LOOK DESCENT FOR THE OVERNIGHT LOWS BUT ON THE COOL SIDE 
FOR HIGHS.

EXTENDED...WILL UP POPS FOR THURSDAY AS UPPER TROF DIGS INTO FA 
BRINGING THREAT OF SNOW.  ATTM LOOKS LIKE AN INCH OR TWO WILL BE

AREA OF LOW CLOUDS SPREADING EASTWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS

CLOUDS WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST OVER THE AREA. SHORT WAVE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THIS MID AND UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BRUSH BY TO THE NORTH. WITH

AFTER THAT HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN ON SUNDAY. EXPECT A WARM FRONTAL 
PASSAGE ON SUNDAY NIGHT WHICH WILL BRING HIGHER TEMPERATURES AND 
MOISTURE. LATEST MODEL RUNS SUGGEST THAT NEXT COLD FRONT WILL BE A 
LITTLE SLOWER TO MOVE EAST EARLY NEXT WEEK. SHOWERS STILL SEEM 
LIKELY BUT THE TIMING IS IN QUESTION. BASED ON LATEST DATA BELIEVE 
THAT WILL BE LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH JUST A LOW CHANCE 
BEFORE THEN.

FOR TEMPERATURES BELIEVE THAT GOING AT OR SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE

850 MB LOW WAS PIVOTING NE THROUGH ERN INDIANA THIS MORNING.  
DEFORMATION/CONVERGENCE AXIS ASSOCD WITH THE 850 MB WILL WEAKEN AS 
IT MOVES INTO OHIO FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING HOURS.  
HOWEVER...THERE SHOULD STILL BE ENOUGH SNOWFALL OVER THE CURRENT 
WARNED AREAS TO CONTINUE WARNING UNTIL AT LEAST NOON.  WILL 
DOWNGRADE WINTER STORM WARNING FOR DAYTON AND PARTS OF CENTRAL OHIO 
TO AN ADVISORY UNTIL NOON.  EXPECT AND ADDITIONAL 1 TO 3 INCHES IN 
THE WARNING...1 TO 2 IN THE ADVISORY...AND AN INCH OR LESS GENERALLY 
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE CWFA.  SNOW WILL TAPER OFF TO SCATTERED 
SNOW SHOWERS DURING THE AFTN AS REGION REMAINS UNDER CYCLONIC FLOW 
ALOFT.

UPR LOW PRES SYSTEM WILL MOVE AWAY FROM REGION TONIGHT.  WEAK AXIS 
OF VORTICITY AT 500 MB MAY BE ENOUGH TO KICK OFF A FEW FLURRIES...SO 
WILL KEEP A CHC OF FLURRIES ALL ZONES TONIGHT.

WITH SOME WAA ALOFT ON THURSDAY...CLOUDS WILL DECREASE ACRS THE

A WEAK AREA OF H5 LOW PRES WILL MOVE ACRS THE REGION ON FRIDAY.  AS 
OF NOW...SYSTEM LOOKS MOISTURE STARVED WITH LITTLE SFC REFLECTION.  
WILL GO WITH PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS.

A WARM FRONT WILL MOVE FROM THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS STATES 
THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VLY ON SATURDAY.  AS IT DOES...IT 
MAY KICK OFF A FEW SNOW FLURRIES.  THUS...PLAN ON LEAVING A CHC OF 
FLURRIES FOR SATURDAY.

WILL KEEP COOL TEMPS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM...MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
GFS MAV GUIDANCE.  WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THURSDAY NIGHT...TEMPS 
SHOULD DROP IN THE TEENS MOST LOCATIONS.  IT COULD CONCEIVABLY DROP 
INTO THE 5 TO 15 DEGREE RANGE WHERE THE SNOW PACK IS THE GREATEST

PRECIPITATION LOOKS LIKE IT IS PREDOMINANTLY SNOW FROM DAY NORTH AND 
WEST WITH FAIRLY SOLID COVERAGE THERE. MEANWHILE IT HAS BEEN PATCHY 
IN THE SOUTHEAST. SOME LOCATIONS IN THAT PART OF THE AREA ARE STILL 
ABOVE FREEZING SO THAT REMAINS LIGHT RAIN OR FREEZING RAIN. IN 
BETWEEN THESE TWO AREAS PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN OFF AND ON FREEZING 
RAIN PREDOMINANTLY WITH SOME SLEET AND/OR SNOW MIXED IN.

FORECAST PROFILE FROM THE 12Z ETA LOOK CLOSER THAN THE 18Z ETA TO 
WHAT WAS OBSERVED WITH THE 00Z ILN SOUNDING. THIS IS A BIT OF A 
CONCERN BECAUSE THE 12Z ETA SUGGESTS A LATER CHANGE OVER TO ALL SNOW 
TONIGHT WHICH WOULD IMPACT ACCUMULATIONS. 

HOWEVER...THAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A PROBLEM FOR THE NORTHWEST 
QUARTER OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE SNOW IS ALREADY OCCURRING. IT 
APPEARS THAT THIS AREA WILL BE IN/NEAR THE BAND OF HEAVIEST SNOW.

WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES LOOK GOOD AND NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO 
THEIR EXTENT OR TIMING. WILL JUST MAKE SOME MODIFICATIONS TO THE 
FORECAST CONCERNING PRECIPITATION TYPES AND THE TRANSITION TO SNOW.

THE WINTER WEATHER SITUATION CONTINUES TO BE THE FOCUS OF THE FCST. 
THE LATEST GFS AND ETA HAVE SIMILAR LOW TRACKS...WITH THE GFS  
SOMEWHAT COOLER ALOFT.  THE 12Z ETA HAS THE 850 MB 0 C ISOTHERM 
THROUGH DAYTON AT 06Z WHILE THE GFS IS AROUND -2 C.  BOTH MODELS 
COOL OFF RAPIDLY ALOFT BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z...WITH A RANGE OF -7 C TO 
-2 C AT 850 MB FROM KAOH TO KPMH. 

USING A COMBINATION OF WINTER WEATHER TECHNIQUES...AREAS IN 
NORTHWEST OHIO WILL STAY ALL SNOW THIS EVENING...WITH A MIX OF 
FZRA...SLEET AND SOME SNOW ELSEWHERE.  SOME RAIN WILL ALSO BE 
POSSIBLE IN THE SOUTH EARLY WHERE TEMPS ARE ABOVE FZ.  LATE EVENING 
TO AROUND 09Z...THE PCPN MIX SHOULD CHANGE TO ALL SNOW NORTHWEST TO 
SOUTHEAST. 

WILL KEEP THE EXISTING WINTER STORM WARNING FOR MUCH OF THE 
NORTHWEST FCST AREA.  BASED ON MODEL QPF...ISENTROPIC TECHNIQUES 
AND EXISTING CONDITIONS TO THE WEST...THE FAR NW COULD SEE 4-6 
INCHES OF SNOW WITH 3-5 INCHES ELSEWHERE IN THE WARNING AREA.  THE 
CENTRAL OHIO AREA WILL HAVE 2-4 INCH STORM TOTAL AMOUNTS...AND A 
HIGH END ADVISORY.  IF THIS ZONE CHANGES OVER TO SNOW MORE 
QUICKLY...THESE AMOUNTS WILL INCREASE.  IN THE SOUTH...1 TO 3 INCHES 
CAN BE EXPECTED...WITH MORE AND LONGER MIX DURATION.

THE SNOW WILL LINGER INTO CHRISTMAS DAY...SCATTERING OUT FROM WEST

ALTHOUGH ETA/GFS MODELS ARE CONVERGING ON A SOLUTION...THERE IS 
STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY WHEN AND HOW MUCH PCPN WILL FALL ACRS THE 
CWFA.

AT 08Z...SFC LOW PRESSURE WAS DEVELOPING OVER SW ALABAMA.  A BLEND 
OF THE GFS/ETA TAKES THIS SFC LOW FROM NRN ALABAMA THIS AFTERNOON 
INTO SE OHIO BY CHRISTMAS MORNING.  MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW 
WAA/ISENTROPIC LIFT...AIDING IN PCPN DEVELOPMENT INTO THE AFTN 
HOURS.  ETA MOST GENEROUS WITH QPF WHILE AVN IS SKIMPY.  AM 
CONCERNED THAT CONVECTION GOING ON ALONG THE GULF COAST STATES MAY 
ROB SOME OF THE MOISTURE INTO THE REGION TODAY.  WILL STICK WITH THE 
ETA ATTM...AND DEVELOP PCPN FROM NORTH TO SOUTH TODAY.  PCPN SHOULD 
BEGIN INITIALLY AS SNOW...BUT MIX WITH FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET 
ACROSS CVG...DAY AND CMH.  THE FAR SOUTHERN TIER SHOULD CHANGE TO 
ALL RAIN BY THE MID AFTERNOON HOURS.

BY TONIGHT...GOOD 850 MB CONVERGENCE WITH 850 MB LOW TRACKING ALONG 
THE OHIO RIVER WILL PLACE THE WAPOK/DAYTON REGION IN A DEVELOPING 
SNOW BAND.  3 TO AS MUCH AS 6 INCHES OF SNOW COULD FALL ACRS THIS 
REGION.  ATTM...BELIEVE THE ETA MODEL SOLUTION WHICH DEVELOPS A DRY 
SLOT ACRS THE REMAINDER OF THE REGION...CAUSING PCPN TO BECOME 
SCATTERED IN NATURE THERE.  AS THE SFC LOW MOVES TOWARD SE 
OHIO...ALL PCPN WILL BECOME SNOW LATE TONIGHT.

ON CHRISTMAS...A COLD...BLUSTERY DAY IS EXPECTED WITH SCATTERED SNOW 
SHOWERS WITH LITTLE ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATION FORECAST.

COMPLEX WEATHER SCENARIO CONTINUES TO EVOLVE. MESOSCALE BAND HAS 
FORMED FROM SOUTHERN ILLINOIS INTO EASTERN KENTUCKY. THIS IS WHERE 
CONFLUENT FLOW IS RESULTING IN FRONTOGENESIS. THIS IS OCCURRING JUST 
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. ALTHOUGH LATEST RADAR TRENDS SUGGEST 
THAT THERE IS LITTLE MOVEMENT OF THIS BAND...CANNOT RULE OUT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF IT DRIFTING A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH LATER TONIGHT. SO 
WILL BREAK OUT MOST OF THE KENTUCKY ZONES AND INDICATE A HIGHER 
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION. OTHERWISE FORECAST FOR THE REST OF THE

MANY ISSUES WITH THE WINTER WEATHER SITUATION TUESDAY AND TUESDAY 
NIGHT.  THE GFS AND ETA ARE IN DISAGREEMENT ABOUT THE TRACK OF THE 
LOW AND THEREFORE THE ASSOCIATED FIELDS.  THE 12Z ETA IS STILL 
STRONGER AND FARTHER NORTH WITH THE LOW.  WITH THE NORTHERN LOW 
TRACK OF THE ETA...MUCH OF THE AREA SOUTH OF I-71 WOULD SEE SNOW 
LATE TONIGHT CHANGING TO A MIX OF FZRA...SLEET AND SNOW BY EARLY 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING...AND THEN TAPERING TO ALL SNOW.  
THE AREA NORTH OF THIS WOULD SEE MAINLY SNOW AS EVEN THE ETA HAS NO 
WARM LAYER ALOFT HERE....WITH SOME APPLIED SNOW METHODS SUGGESTING 3 
TO 5 INCHES OF SNOW DURING THIS PERIOD.  IN CONTRAST...THE GFS 
POINTS TO AN ALL LIGHT SNOW EVENT...WITH VERY LITTLE QPF TO WORK 
WITH.  

WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS AT THIS POINT.  WILL CONTINUE 
A WINTER STORM WATCH TUESDAY AND TUESDAY EVENING FOR BASICALLY THE 
SOUTHEAST HALF OF THE FCST AREA WHERE THE POTENTIAL OF FZRA COULD BE 
A BIG PROBLEM AS TEMPS WILL BE NEAR/BELOW FZ ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA 
IF THE ETA IS CLOSE.  ELSEWHERE...WILL EXPECT 1 TO 3 INCHES OF 
SNOW...PERHAPS MIXED WITH SOME SLEET...AND A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY.

THE PCPN WILL TAPER OFF BY LATE EVENING WITH A CHANCE OF -SHSN  
LINGERING INTO CHRISTMAS DAY. 

OBVIOUSLY...THE UNCERTAIN TRACK OF THE LOW WILL COULD CHANGE THE 
ONSET..DURATION...INTENSITY AND POSITIONING OF PRECIP TYPES.

FORECAST CHALLENGE THIS MORNING REVOLVES AROUND DEVELOPING SYSTEM 
FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AND ASSOCIATED PCPN AMOUNTS AND TYPES. 
MODELS CONTINUE THEIR INDECISION WITH EXACTLY HOW TO HANDLE THIS. 

00Z ETA HAS TRENDED MUCH FARTHER NORTH WITH PRECIPITATION WHILE GFS 
STILL KEEPING BULK OF PRECIPITATION TO OUR SOUTH. GENERAL CONSENSUS 
SEEMS TO BE TO GO WITH THE GFS DUE TO ITS MORE CONSISTENT SOUTHERN 
TRACK. HOWEVER...ETA AND GFS REALLY NOT THAT FAR OFF ON THEIR 
PLACEMENT OF THE SFC LOW AT 00Z WED. ETA STRONGER AND A LITTLE 
FARTHER NORTH WHILE GFS NOT AS STRONG BUT DOES HAVE INVERTED TROF 
EXTENDING NORTH INTO OHIO VALLEY. WITH ETA STRONGER WITH LOW...8H 
WIND FIELDS MUCH MORE IMPRESSIVE THAN THE GFS AND THUS HELPING ETA 
CRANK OUT MUCH MORE PCPN ACROSS OUR AREA IN REGION OF STRONGER LOW 
LEVEL CONVERGENCE. WITH THIS THOUGH...ETA ALSO PULLING UP MUCH 
WARMER AIR INTO OUR AREA AND POINTING TOWARD MORE OF A RAIN/FREEZING 
RAIN TYPE SITUATION RATHER THAN SNOW. 

MEANWHILE...GIVEN POSITION OF SURFACE AND 8H LOW...GFS SEEMS TO BE A 
LITTLE UNDERDONE WITH ITS LOW LEVEL WIND FIELDS BUT EVEN WITH THESE 
WEAKER WIND FIELDS...CROSS CONTOUR ISENT LIFT PRESENT ON THE 290 K 
SURFACES FROM 12Z TUES THRU 00Z WED. MUCH OF THE TIME FROM 12Z TO 
18Z WILL GO INTO SATURATING THE COLUMN BUT AFTER THAT...IT LOOKS 
LIKE A GOOD 6 HOURS PLUS OF DECENT ISENT LIFT WITH LOW CONDENSATION 
PRESSURE DEFICITS FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY EVENING SO 
THINK QPF OFF GFS MAY BE UNDERDONE ACROSS OUR AREA FOR THAT PERIOD. 

WITH ALL THIS IN MIND...EXPECT PCPN TO START LATE TONIGHT ACROSS THE 
FAR SOUTH AND THEN SPREAD SLOWLY NORTH AS WE HEAD THROUGH TUESDAY. 
USING A BIT OF BLEND OF THE ETA AND GFS THICKNESSES...WILL ALLOW FOR 
A MIXTURE OF FREEZING RAIN/SLEET AND SNOW ALONG THE I71 CORRIDOR 
FROM CVG TO CMH WITH MORE RAIN DOWN TOWARD PMH AND MORE SNOW DAY AND 
CMH. PCPN SHOULD CHANGE OVER TO ALL SNOW TUESDAY NIGHT AS MID LEVEL 
S/W WORKS EAST ACROSS REGION. 

IF ALL SNOW...CURRENT THINKING WOULD BE ABOUT 3-5 INCHES FROM CVG TO 
CMH BUT MIXED PCPN WILL CUT DOWN ON THIS. HOWEVER...WITH FREEZING 
RAIN AND SLEET ALSO POSSIBLE...THINGS COULD STILL GET PRETTY MESSY. 
GIVEN UNCERTAINTIES AND FLIP FLOPPING OF MODELS...AM HESITANT TO 
ISSUE A WATCH BUT WE ARE NOW ONLY 3 PERIODS OUT AND DEALING WITH 
MAJOR HOLIDAY SO FEEL MOST PRUDENT THING NOW IS TO GO AHEAD AND 
ISSUE A WINTER STORM WATCH SW TO NE ACROSS CENTRAL PORTIONS OF 
FA...PRETTY MUCH FROM CVG METRO AREA TO CMH METRO. TO THE SE IN PMH 
AREA...EXPECT PCPN WILL BE RAIN LONG ENOUGH TO CUT DOWN ON ICE/SNOW 
ACCUMS WHILE NW ACROSS WAPOK/DAY AREA...QPF AMOUNTS SHOULD BE A 
LITTLE LOWER AND BELOW WARING CRITERIA. OBVIOUSLY...THIS WATCH AREA 
IS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON EXACT TRACK OF LOW. 

WILL NOT MAKE TOO MANY CHANGES TO REMAINDER OF FORECAST. STILL LOOKS 
LIKE POSSIBILITY FOR SOME LINGERING SCT SNOW SHOWERS CHRISTMAS DAY 
SO WILL HANG ON TO LOW POP THEN.

AFTERNOON. MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE.

ANOTHER CLD FNT MOVES ACROSS AREAS SAT NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. GFS MODEL 
P TYPES AND INDICATE RA UNTIL 12Z SUNDAY AS DO SOME OTHER P TYPE 
TECHNIQUES APPLIED AT FFO FROM GFS SNDGS THERE.  ETA LOW LEVEL 
THICKESSES SUGGEST SOME SN.

ON EXTENDED...GUIDANCE TRENDING COLDER.  THE GFS HAS THE SOUTHERN 
SYSTEM LATE CHRISTMAS EVE/CHRISTMAS TRACKING TOO FAR SOUTH FOR 
SIGNIFICANT SNOW ACROSS FCST AREA AT THIS TIME.  HOWEVER...RECENT 
ACTUAL LOW TRACKS HAVE TRENDED NORTH OF MODEL RUNS SO WILL KEEP 
CHANCE OF SNOW.

RADAR LOOP SHOWING AREA OF RAIN MOVING NORTH THROUGH INDIANA AND 
WESTERN OHIO.  THIS HAS MOISTENED THE COLUMN AND APPEARS TO HAVE CUT 
DOWN ON THE WINDS.  WILL BACK OFF ON THE WINDS FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  
QUICK LOOK AT 12Z ETA IS INDICATING A CHANCE OF THUNDER IS WANING 
ACROSS THE NORTH AS NOSE OF THE 850 JET SLIDES FROM CENTRAL KY INTO 
SOUTHEAST OHIO.  THIS IS WHERE THE BEST KS ARE ALSO.  WILL REMOVE 
MENTION OF THUNDER ACROSS THEN NORTH.  AM TEMPTED TO DROP FLOOD 
WATCH ACROSS THE NORTH...BUT FOR NOW WILL LEAVE IT ALONE.  WILL PASS 
ON TO TONIGHT FORECASTER...AND HE MIGHT SCALE IT BACK AT 4 PM.

AS FAR AS AN UPDATE GOES TONIGHT, TEMPS ARE RUNNING ON AND SHOULD 
STAY FAIRLY STEADY THROUGH THE NIGHT. CURRENT BREAKDOWN FOR TONIGHT 
PERIOD IS JUST WEST AND EAST WITH LIKELY AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. 
WILL NOT INCREASE OR DECREASE EITHER AS LINE OF SHOWERS WITH SOME 
THUNDER SHOULD GET INTO WESTERN ZONES TONIGHT AND MOVE EAST TOMORROW 
MORNING. 

HEAVY RAIN IS POSSIBLE OVER SRN FCST AREA TOMORROW, BUT IS ALREADY 
MENTIONED IN ZONES. 

ASIDE FROM COSMETIC WORDING CHANGES I CANT FIND ANYTHING IN CURRENT 
ZONES TO IMPROVE UPON. WILL SEND UPDATE WITH STEADY TEMPS TONIGHT 
AND REMOVE ANY MENTION OF BRISK. LOW TEMPS IN DECEMBER IN THE UPPER 
40S DOESNT REALLY SAY BRISK TO ME - WILL CHANGE TO BREEZY. FOR

SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WITH SUSTAINED WINDS OF 20

CLOUDY SKIES.

MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH MAJOR FEATURES BUT VARY WITH 
TIMING OF PRECIP AND HOW THEY HANDLE SECOND UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK 
LATTER ON THURSDAY.  GFS HAS BEEN MOST CONSISTENT WITH THIS FEATURE 
AND TEND TO BELIEVE MORE.  OVERNIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING THINK THE 
ETA HAS A BETTER HANDLE AS EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF CONVECTION TODAY HAS 
NOT MADE A WHOLE LOT OF PROGRESS.  IN OTHER WORDS WILL BACK OFF ON

ADD TO THE SEVERE WIND POTENTIAL FOR EVEN SHALLOW CONVECTION.  LOW 
LEVEL SHEAR WILL ALSO BE HIGH (50 M/S).  CONCERNED ALSO ABOUT THE 
FLOODING THREAT.  ONE HOUR FFG IS GENERALLY AN INCH OR LESS WITH THE 
HIGHEST VALUES IN CENTRAL OHIO.  3 HOURS ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN 2 
INCHES.  PWS ARE EXPECTED TO BE AROUND AN 1 TO 1.25 WHICH WILL BE

FLOWS WITHIN 20 DEGREES OF EACH OTHER.  THINK ITS TOO EARLY FOR A 
FLASH FLOOD WATCH YET SINCE TIMING...EXTENT AND TRUE NATURE OF 
CONVECTION ARE NOT YET KNOWN.  

EXTENDED...NEXT THREAT OF PRECIP WILL COME IN THE FORM OF SNOW 
SATURDAY NIGHT WITH A FAST MOVING WAVE.  THEN THREAT OF MAJOR WINTER 
WINTER STORM EAST OF MISSISSIPPI TOWARDS CHRISTMAS.  HOWEVER...ITS 
A LITTLE EARLY TO GET EXCITED ABOUT IT AS MODEL RUNS HAVE PLENTY OF

UPDATED TO ALLOW ADVISORY TO EXPIRE.  TEMPERATURES ARE AROUND FREEZING 
OR JUST ABOVE WITH TEMPERATURES CONTINUING TO WARM.  A FEW LOCALS ARE 
REPORTING A LIGHT GRAZE ON METAL OBJECTS.  MGY AND ILN REPORTED 
FREEZING RAIN FOR A PERIOD OF TIME.  CONDITIONS WILL STILL BE SLICK IN 
A FEW LOCALS BUT THE RISE OF A DEGREE OR TWO IN THE NEXT HOUR SHOULD 
MAKE METAL SURFACES JUST WET.

-

UPDATED TO LOWER TEMPS AND TO PUT OUT FREEZING RAIN ADVISORY TILL 1 
PM FOR PORTIONS OF THE FA.  TEMPS ARE AT OR BELOW FREEZING WITH RAIN 
FALLING AT SOME LOCALS.  THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A BIG FREEZING 
RAIN EVENT AND SHOULD ONLY ACCUMULATE ON CARS TREES AND POWERS LINES.

-------------------------------------------------------------------

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES WARM FRONT ACROSS KENTUCKY WITH THE 
SURFACE 32 DEGREE LINE THROUGH SOUTHWEST OHIO.  SATELLITE IMAGERY 
INDICATES COOL TOPS NEAR SDF.  KILN SHOWING SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS 
OVER SOUTHERN FA WITH KLVX SHOWING A GOOD SWATH OF SHOWERS JUST TO 
OUR SOUTH.  ON THE NORTHERN EDGE OF PRECIP A LITTLE BIT OF SLEET CAN 
BE EXPECTED.  RECENTLY A FEW STROKES OF LIGHTNING WAS INDICATED 
BETWEEN SDF AND EVV.

WILL UPDATE ZONES TO UP POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST AND IN THE WAPAK 
GROUP.  OTHERWISE JUST ADJUST WORDING.  ZONES LOOK GREAT.  WILL LET 
NOWCASTS DEAL WITH THE BRIEF ONSET OF SLEET.  THIS SHOULD BECOME 
LESS OF A PROBLEM THIS AFTERNOON AS TEMPS WARM THEN PRETTY MUCH ALL

ETA/AVN VERY SIMILAR WITH MAJOR WX FEATURES THIS RUN. HOWEVER 
SOMEWHAT MORE NOTIBLE DIFFERENCES SEEN WITH TIMING OF WARM FRONTAL 
PASSAGE ACROSS OH VALLEY ON WEDNESDAY. AS TO MODEL TRENDS...ETA 
MODEL HAS APPEARED TO BE SHOWING SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE POSITION OF 
COLD FRNT WHICH WILL CROSS OUR AREA WITHIN THE NEXT 12 HRS. AVN HAS 
BEEN MUCH MORE CONSISTANT WITH THIS FEATURE. REGARDING THE WARM 
FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECED ON WEDNESDAY...BOTH MODELS STILL APPEARING 
TO BE MAKING ADJUSTMENTS WITH THIS FEATURE. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT 
THE AVN HAS BEEN THE MORE CONSISTANT MODEL WITH PLACEMENT OF THIS 
FEATURE AS WELL.

FCSTING COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON THURSDAY WILL BE A BIT OF CHALLANGE. 
AVN HAD BEEN QUITE CONSISTANT UNTIL THIS LATEST RUN WHERE IT SLOWED 
THIS FEATURE QUITE NOTICABLY. SEEMS A BIT INCONSISTANT...SO WILL 
TAKE THIS ADJUSTMENT WITH A GRAIN OF SALT. MAY SLOW THIS FEATURE 
DOWN A BIT...BUT NOT TOO CONFIDENT TO GO SOLELY WITH THE MODEL 
GUIDANCE.

OTHER THAN CHC PRECIP WITH THE WARM FRONTAL PASSAGE ON 
WEDNESDAY...WILL GO LIKELY POPS WITH CLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON THURSDAY 
GIVEN THE CONSISTANT MODEL TRENDS. MAY BE SOME FLURRIES NE PORTION 
OF FA EARLY TOMORROW AS A RESULT OF POTENTIAL LK EFFECT.

.ILN...NONE.

AM NOT GOING TO WAIT 3-4 HOURS FOR MODEL DATA TO COME IN. WILL SEND 
AFTERNOON FCST OUT WITH PREVIOUS RUNS AND WHATEVER INFO I CAN GET MY 
HANDS ON RIGHT NOW. 

NO MAJOR CHANGES TO FCST, WILL KEEP ADVY WHERE IT IS UNLESS 
CONFERENCE CALL TELLS ME THAT IM MUCH TOO LOW ON AMOUNTS. CURRENT 
FCST HAS A CHANGEOVER FOR MOST OF CWA IN THE TODAY PERIOD. I THINK 
THAT KCVG AND KCMH AREAS WONT CHANGE OVER UNTIL LATER THIS EVENING 
AND WILL TRY TO ADD SOME TIMING HERE, AND POSSIBLY THE KDAY GROUPING.

VERTICALLY STACKED SYSTEM PASSING SE OF FCST AREA. BEST UVV, VORTS, 
AND DYNAMICS ARE RIGHT ALONG THE TRACK OF THE LOW. EXTENSIVE 
MOISTURE IN PLACE OVER FCST AREA. H8 TEMPS START TOO WARM BEFORE 
APPROACHING LOW, BUT BY 6Z REACH A MORE FAVORABLE (-2) ACROSS NW 
THIRD OF FCST AREA AND IN THE BEST SECTION TO THE LEFT OF THE LOW. 
BY 12Z, H8 TEMPS ACROSS FA ARE -2 -3 ALTHOUGH LOW IS PROGGED TO BE 
WELL E OF FCST AREA AND HEAVY SNOW NOT EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. 

CURRENT THINKING IS A SWATH OF HEAVY SNOW FROM RICHMOND TO TROY 
(JUST N OF KDAY) TO MARYSVILLE (JUST NW OF KCMH). MAJORITY OF SNOW 
BETWEEN THE HOURS OF ABOUT 3 AND 8Z. OTHER FACTORS WILL LIMIT HEAVY 
SNOW TO THE SOUTHEAST (TOO WARM AND A LATER CHANGEOVER TO -SN). NW 
OF HEAVY SNOW SWATH...MOISTURE CUTS OFF RATHER QUICKLY AND 
DYNAMICS ARENT VERY FAVORABLE IN THE FIRST PLACE. DYNAMICS ARE 
STRONGEST WITH THE LOW CENTER AND IN THE RAIN. 

FOR AMOUNTS...AVG MIX RATIO FOR 12 HRS OVER AREA OF CONCERN IS ABOUT 
2 G/KG WHICH WOULD RESULT IN 4 INCHES PER GARCIA METHOD. RIGHT NOW, 
FCST CONDITIONS WOULD MAKE THIS A MAXIMUM SINCE QUICKER TIMING WOULD 
LIMIT AMOUNT OF SNOW AND SOME AREAS WILL TAKE TIME TO SWITCH TO SNOW.

NEXT SYSTEM TO PUT AN IMPACT ON FCST AREA WILL BEGIN AS A WMFNT OVER 
FCST AREA ON MONDAY WITH SOME CONVERGENCE EXPECTED SUN PM AND A 
SMALL CHANCE OF -RA. RUNNING OFF OF GFS, FRONT IS INACTIVE AS A 
PRECIP MAKER UNTIL EARLY TUES AS H5 LOW GETS INTO WI AND RIDGE 
BREAKS DOWN OVER FCST AREA. SUBSEQUENT RUNS OF GFS HAVE SLOWED THIS 
SYSTEM DOWN AS IT RUNS INTO THE RIDGE. AFTER THIS, DUE SOUTH WINDS 
KEEP US IN THE WARM SECTOR FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. DYNAMICS ARE N OF 
OHVLY BUT A BROAD N-S ORIENTED CDFNT SHOULD MOVE E AND PUSH THROUGH 
REGION LATE ON THURSDAY. EXPECT WED PM AND THURS TEMPS TO BE QUITE 
MILD. FRIDAY WILL BE COOLER AND DRIER, BUT STILL AOA NORMAL DURING 
DAYTIME HOURS. AM TIMING THINGS A LITTLE SLOWER ON EXTENDED, SO 
MONDAYS HIGHS WONT SEE A BIG WARMUP IN WAKE OF CDFNT.

13Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER NE 
MS.  PREVIOUS 00Z ETA AND 00Z GFS WERE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
TRACK OF THIS LOW.  HOWEVER...THE 06Z ETA HAS DEVIATED FROM THIS 
TREND (MORE NORTHWEST TOWARD PMH) WHILE THE 06Z AVN KEEPS THE LOW 
TRACKING FROM NEAR BNA AROUND 18Z TO NEAR LOZ BY 00Z.  THIS TRACK 
WOULD PUT THE HEAVIEST SNOW SWATH NEAR A CVG TO CMH LINE.  ANY 
SLIGHT DEVIATION (ESPECIALLY TO THE NW) WOULD PIVOT THIS ANTICIPATED 
HEAVIER BAND TOWARD DAY TO MFD. WILL CONTINUE WITH THE AVN TREND OF 
THE LOW TRACK SINCE IT HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT.  
THEREFORE...CURRENT FCST OF DEVELOPING RAIN...THEN GRADUALLY 
CHANGING TO SNOW STILL LOOKS GOOD.  BELIEVE ONCE WE GET MORE OF A

13Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER NE 
MS.  PREVIOUS 00Z ETA AND 00Z GFS WERE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
TRACK OF THIS LOW.  HOWEVER...THE 06Z ETA HAS DEVIATED FROM THIS 
TREND (MORE NORTHWEST TOWARD PMH) WHILE THE 06Z AVN KEEPS THE LOW 
TRACKING FROM NEAR BNA AROUND 18Z TO NEAR LOZ BY 00Z.  THIS TRACK 
WOULD PUT THE HEAVIEST SNOW SWATH NEAR A CVG TO CMH LINE.  ANY 
SLIGHT DEVIATION (ESPECIALLY TO THE NW) WOULD PIVOT THIS ANTICIPATED 
HEAVIER BAND TOWARD DAY TO MFD. WILL CONTINUE WITH THE AVN TREND OF 
THE LOW TRACK SINCE IT HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT.  
THEREFORE...CURRENT FCST OF DEVELOPING RAIN...THEN GRADUALLY 
CHANGING TO SNOW STILL LOOKS GOOD.  BELIEVE ONCE WE GET MORE OF A 
NORTHERLY COMPONENT AT THE SFC AND WITH DYNAMIC COOLING...SNOW 
SHOULD COMMENCE.  WILL KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THE LOW TRACK JUST TO SEE 
WHAT ACTUALLY PANS OUT.

HAVE FORMED ACRS NORTHERN KENTUCKY AND SW OH WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE 
IN LOWEST 4KFT. SKIES WERE CURRENTLY CLR ACRS MUCH OF NORTHERN INDIANA 
AND NW OH.

THROUGH SAT NIGHT...TWO MAIN ISSUES TO CONTEND WITH THIS FCST 
PACKAGE...FIRST INVOLVING FG/CLOUDS FOR TODAY.  LOWEST VSBYS (LESS 
THAN 1 MILE) UNDER ST DECK SLOWLY ADVANCING NORTH ATTM.  ST DECK 
CURRENTLY OVERSPREADING DAY/CMH ZONES AND SHOULD EVENTUALLY WORK WAY 
INTO WEST CNTRL OH BEFORE DAWN.  MODEL SOUNDINGS INDCG DEEP LO LVL 
MOISTURE HANGS TOUGH INTO ERLY AFTN ACRS MUCH OF FCST AREA...AND 
FEEL MAY HAVE DIFFICULT TIME BURNING OFF FG IN EFFICIENT MANNER THIS 
MRNG.  COUPLE REASONS FOR MY THINKING...LO SUN ANGLE IN MID DECEMBER 
AND MODELS NOT INDCG WAA PATTERN DVLPG UNTIL AFTN.  AM GOING MSTLY CLDY 
ACRS ENTIRE FCST AREA TODAY...WITH MENTION TO PTLY CLDY DURING 
AFTN.  WILL LOWER FCST HIGHS TODAY A FEW DEGREES FROM PREV FCST 
CONSIDERING MORE CLOUDS.  AMT OF SUNSHINE THIS AFTN WILL ULTIMATELY 
DETERMINE HI TEMPS.  DENSE FOG STILL PATCHY WITH CVG ONLY ASOS 
REPORTING 1/2 MILE OR LESS ATTM...SO NOT PLANNING ADVISORY THIS MRNG.

SECOND FCST ISSUE REVOLVES AROUND NEXT WX MAKER TO AFFECT FCST AREA 
FRI/SAT.  GFS/ETA IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRI MORN IN DVLPG UPR LO

ENERGY TRANSFER TO COASTAL SYSTEM OVERNIGHT FRI.  TRENDING TOWARDS 
GFS AS IT APPEARS TO BE HANDLING UPR LO MOVEMENT AND TRACK 
BETTER...AND UKMET/ECMWF SUPPORTING SIMILAR SOLNS. MID/HI LVL CLOUDS

UPPER AIR PATTERN HAS TROF ENTERING THE OHIO VALLEY.  TROF AXIS IS 
PROGGED TO BISECT ILN CWA AROUND 18Z WEDNESDAY.  WITH THE FASTER GFS 
BEING THE MODEL OF CHOICE...TROF WILL BE OVER MAINE BY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON.  

DEVELOPING SURFACE TROF WILL LIFT THROUGH THE REGION TONIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY.  PLENTY OF MOISTURE THAT IS ALREADY QUITE EVIDENT ON 
SATELLITE AND RADAR WILL ACCOMPANY THE TROF.  LATEST GFS SHOWS 
PRECIP ACROSS OUR WHOLE AREA...SO ILL INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY 
TONIGHT FROM WEST CENTRAL OHIO TO COLUMBUS.  CATEGORICAL POPS ARE 
APPROPRIATE FOR THE REST OF THE AREA...INCLUDING CINCINNATI AND 
DAYTON.

WITH DRY HIGH PRESSURE IN PLACE...PRECIP FALLING THROUGH THE DRY 
BOUNDARY LAYER AIR WILL RESULT IN A GOOD AMOUNT OF EVAPORATIONAL 
COOLING.  SURFACE TEMPS WILL FALL BACK BELOW FREEZING TONIGHT...AND 
WITH WARM AIR ALOFT...WE EXPECT FREEZING RAIN ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA 
TONIGHT THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY.  A BIT OF DIURNAL LOW LEVEL WARMING 
WILL TURN PRECIP TO RAIN BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.  

WEVE DECIDED ON A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR OUR ENTIRE AREA.  
HIGHEST QPF IS INDICATED IN OUR SOUTHERN ZONES. HOWEVER...SLIGHTLY 
WARMER TEMPS IN THE SOUTH SHOULD ALLOW SOME OF THE PRECIP TO FALL AS 
RAIN.  WE WILL NEED TO MONITOR ICE ACCUMULATIONS...BECAUSE IF ALL 
EXPECTED PRECIP WERE TO FALL AS FREEZING RAIN...WARNING CRITERIA OF 
0.25 COULD BE MET. 

SYSTEM WILL PULL AWAY RATHER QUICKLY BY LATE WEDNESDAY.  ILL CARRY 
A CHANCE OF RAIN AND FREEZING RAIN AT COLUMBUS EARLY WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...WITH CLOUDY SKIES ELSEWHERE.  HIGH PRESSURE MOVING THROUGH 
KENTUCKY WILL BRING PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ON THURSDAY.

TEMPS:  MAV GUIDANCE LOOKS TOO COOL TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SO 
ILL GO ABOUT A CATEGORY ABOVE.  MAV HIGHS ARE ACCEPTABLE SO I WONT 
DEVIATE MUCH.  

EXTENDED:  NEXT MAJOR SYSTEM IS DUE TO ARRIVE ON FRIDAY.  SLOWER

UPPER AIR PATTERN SHOWS WESTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY.  FLOW 
WILL TURN SOUTHWEST ON TUESDAY AHEAD OF TROF CURRENTLY DIGGING 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS.  MODELS ARE SIMILAR IN BRINGING TROF TO 
ILN CWA TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.  GFS AND ETA DIFFER BY HOUR 60 
WITH ETA EJECTING TROF MORE QUICKLY TO THE EAST COAST.

AT THE SURFACE...RIDGE EXTENDING FROM THE MID ATLANTIC COAST TO THE 
MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY DOMINATES.  RIDGE IS BEING DRAWN EASTWARD IN 
WESTERLY UPPER FLOW. AS THE UPPER TROF APPROACHES A SURFACE LOW WILL 
DEVELOP IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.  MODELS DIFFER WITH RESPECT TO THE 
LOWS PATH AND ITS EFFECT ON OUR AREA.  GFS HAS THE MAIN LOW WELL 
OFF THE EAST COAST AT 12Z WEDNESDAY WITH TROF HANGING BACK INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY.  THE ETA HAS A MORE INTENSE LOW THAT HUGS THE 
COAST...WITH ONLY A SLIGHT SURFACE TROF PROGGED FOR OUR AREA.  MODEL 
QPF FOLLOWS SAME TREND WITH GFS SHOWING MEASURABLE PRECIP FOR OUR 
ENTIRE CWA TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...WHILE THE ETAS QPF IS 
LIMITED TO SOUTHEAST OHIO.

DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY WITH THE SURFACE HIGH 
RETREATING SLOWLY.  GFS HAS DISPLAYED BETTER RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY 
SO ILL LEAN TOWARD ITS MOISTER SOLUTION FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY.  ILL RAISE POPS TO 30 TUESDAY NIGHT ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN 
ZONES INCLUDING CINCINNATI.  MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL INDICATE CHANCE 
OF FREEZING RAIN TUESDAY NIGHT WITH WARM POCKET AT AROUND 2 KFT AND 
SUB-FREEZING AIR NEAR THE GROUND.  ANY PRECIP SHOULD CHANGE TO RAIN 
ON WEDNESDAY AS THE BOUNDARY LAYER WARMS.  TROF IS POSITIONED FAR 
ENOUGH NORTH TO GIVE OUR ENTIRE CWA CHANCE POPS ON WEDNESDAY.   

TEMPS:  MAV LOOKS TOO WARM TONIGHT AND TOO COOL ON TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY SO ILL ADJUST ACCORDINGLY.  

EXTENDED:  ANOTHER TROF WILL INFLUENCE THE REGION FRIDAY THROUGH 
SUNDAY.  EXPECT SOMEWHAT MILDER TEMPS UNTIL SATURDAY WHEN UPPER LOW

HOWEVER...MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE ONCE AGAIN SHOWING FAIR AMOUNT OF LOW

SLIGHT INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH FRONT DROPPING

IS BRINGING IN A LITTLE EXTRA KICK TO SERN FCST AREA WITH A SFC LOW 
SETTING UP JUST S OF HTS IN WV. AT FIRST, I DIDNT LIKE THE PATTERN 
AND WANTED TO DISCOUNT IT AND GO WITH THE LESS QPF SOLUTION OF THE 
AVN. HOWEVER, EVEN THE AVN IS SHOWING A GOOD INVERTED SFC TROF JUST 
AHEAD OF AN OPEN H7 WAVE WHICH WILL BRING AN ENHANCED AREA OF QPF.

MODELS ARE A LITTLE HIGH ON QPF BTWN 06 AND 12Z THIS MORNING, BUT 
ARENT OUT OF THE QUESTION. IF MODERATE SNOW CONTINUES, ILL HAVE TO 
BUMP CVG AND SCIOTO VALLEY AREAS CURRENTLY IN ADVY INTO A WARNING. 
AFTER CALLING SEVERAL PLACES, 2 INCHES SEEMS PRETTY WIDESPREAD AND I 
COULD SEE ANOTHER 2 OR SO UNTIL IT STOPS THIS MORNING. WILL BUMP 
CURRENT CVG-CHILLICOTHE ADVY AREA TO A WARNING. 

OUTSIDE OF CURRENT/CONTINUING WX, SNOW COVER SHOULD BRING FUTURE 
TEMPS DOWN QUITE A BIT ACROSS THE BOARD. WE NEVER GOT OUT OF THE 
ARCTIC AIRMASS AND JUST LOOK TO GET REINFORCING CAA OVER THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS. TEMPS TODAY SHOULD STAY REASONABLE UNDER AN EXTENSIVE 
CLOUD SHIELD AND NOT MOVE MUCH OUT OF THE MID OR UPPER 20S FOR 
HIGHS. DRY AIR BUILDS DOWN TONIGHT THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE SOME CLOUD 
COVER DUE TO LLVL MOISTURE IN CMH AREA. REST OF FCST AREA WILL BE 
QUITE COLD AND EXPECT TO USE THE COOLER MAV TEMPS.

MODELS IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SYSTEM PASSING BY JUST SOUTH OF 
THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. REGIONAL RADAR SHOWS SNOW APPROACHING 
FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND THIS SHOULD SPREAD ACROSS SOUTHERN ZONES THIS 
EVENING. FORECAST SOUNDINGS FOR PORTSMOUTH SHOWS THAT EVENT SHOULD 
STAY AS ALL SNOW. SO QUESTION IS HOW MUCH WILL FALL AND HOW FAR 
NORTH IT WILL SPREAD.

LATEST RUNS HAVE TRENDED JUST A BIT FURTHER NORTH. AMONGST THE 
LATEST RUNS THE GFS HAS BETTER FORCING AND THUS IS MORE GENEROUS 
WITH PRECIPITATION FURTHER NORTH THAN THE ETA. BELIEVE THAT THE GFS 
IS PROBABLY OVERDONE BUT WILL HEDGE AND SPREAD AT LEAST A CHANCE OF 
SNOW ALL THE WAY ACROSS FAR NORTHERN ZONES. BUT BETTER SNOW WILL BE 
IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL BUMP UP AMOUNTS TO 2 
TO 4 INCHES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER WHICH REMAINS IS STILL ADVISORY 
CRITERIA. IN ADDITION WILL ADD ADVISORY FOR ANOTHER TIER OF COUNTIES 
WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE CINCINNATI METRO AREA ALTHOUGH WITH SLIGHTLY 
LOWER ACCUMULATIONS.

SNOW MAY LINGER EARLY THURSDAY IN THE EASTERN ZONES ALTHOUGH 
ACCUMULATING SNOW SHOULD BE OVER BY DAYBREAK. EXPECT CLOUDS TO START 
DECREASING FROM WEST TO EAST PRIMARILY DURING THE AFTERNOON. HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL SLIDE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AREAS THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT. THEN A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST ON 
SATURDAY. MOISTURE LOOKS LIMITED WITH THIS SYSTEM BUT WILL HAVE A 
CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.

HAVE FOLLOWED ALONG WITH HPC THINKING FOR FORECAST FOR NEXT WEEK 
WHICH BLENDS EUROPEAN...UNITED KINGDOM AND CANADIAN SOLUTIONS. SO 
ANOTHER INVERTED TROUGH WILL DEVELOP INTO THE REGION MONDAY. WILL 
INCLUDE A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. 
PRECIPITATION TYPE IS A BIT OF A QUESTION SINCE TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE

THANKS TO CRW, SDF, CLE, AND JKL FOR COORD.

WWE GRAPHICS ARE WAY OVERDONE ON THE ICE POSSIBILITY OVER SRN FCST 
AREA AND LOOK TO BE ABOUT 1-2 INCHES TOO MUCH ACROSS THE BOARD FOR 
FCST AREA ON SNOW AMOUNTS. ARCTIC AMS IN PLACE OVER ENTIRE CWA WITH 
TEMPS IN THE TEENS. NO WIND FIELDS TO SUPPORT A MAJOR WARMING OVER 
ANY PART OF FCST AREA WITH THIS PRECIP EVENT, SO ALL WX WILL BE FCST 
AS SNOW ONLY. LOOKED AT THE 0Z ETA FOR LEX AND THE SOUNDING 
APPROACHES THE MELTING POINT FOR A CONSIDERABLE DEPTH, BUT NEVER 
CROSSES IT AND THERES A STRONG COLD POOL AT THE SFC. I COULD SEE 
SOME SLEET MIXED IN THE FAR SE RIGHT AROUND 06Z BUT DONT HAVE 
ENOUGH CONFIDENCE THAT WAA WILL BE ENOUGH TO MAKE IT POSSIBLE. 

QPF FROM MODELS IS HIGHEST FROM GFS BUT FAIRLY CONSISTENT ACROSS THE 
BOARD WITH ALL OF THE OPERATIONAL MODELS. HIGHEST AMOUNTS IN SERN 
FCST AREA SHOULD BE AROUND .33 LIQUID AND DROP OFF TO AROUND .2 FROM 
CVG-ILN-CIRCLEVILLE AND LANCASTER. DRY LLVLS WILL MAKE A SHARP 
CUTOFF AS DAY HAS 0 QPF AND CMH ONLY TWO HUNDREDTHS. LAST SNOW EVENT 
LIKE THIS WAS A DISSAPOINTMENT ON THE LIGHT SIDE AND FEEL THAT ANY 
ERROR SHOULD BE TOWARDS THE LESSER QPF WITH THE COLD DRY AMS IN 
PLACE.

AFTER CONFERRING WITH SURROUNDING SRN FOS, WILL PUT AN ADVISORY OUT 
FOR SRN FCST AREA AND EXPECT 1-3 INCHES. ONE OR TWO PLACES COULD SEE 
HIGHER AMOUNTS OF 2-4 INCHES, MAINLY SCOITO AND LEWIS COUNTIES. HIGH 
END OF 4 IS A BIT TOO MUCH AND I DONT THINK THAT ANY WARNING 
CRITERIA WILL BE MET. 

TEMPS WILL ALSO EXPERIENCE QUITE A GRADIENT AS LLVL CLOUDS WONT 
MAKE IT TO NWRN FCST AREA. TEMPS IN THE FAR S TONIGHT SHOULD STAY 
STEADY IN THE MID 20S AFTER DAYTIME HIGHS AROUND THE FREEZING MARK. 

DROPPED CLOUD COVER ON SATURDAY UNTIL COLD POOL COMES IN LATER IN 
THE DAY WITH H8 MOISTURE. FRIDAY WILL BE SUNNY BUT STILL COOL. NOT 
QUITE AS COLD AS GFS IS SHOWING, BUT A MIX BETWEEN CURRENT CCF AND 
MAV NUMBERS, GENERALLY UPPER 20S.

INTERSITE GRIDS FOR QPF, SNOW, ETC ARE IN BUT TEMPS AND OTHER 
VARIABLES WILL BE A LITTLE WHILE LONGER.

IMAGERY INDICATES CLOUDS THICKENING OVER FA AS THE DEVELOPING LOW 
PULLS MOISTURE OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO.

CURRENT FORECAST FOR THE OVERNIGHT LOOKS GOOD.  NO UPDATES 
ANTICIPATED.  18Z RUNS OF BOTH THE GFS AND ETA ARE A BIT MORE 
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE NORTHERN JET WHICH HELPS TO BRING MORE MOISTURE

DRY AIR OVER FCST AREA TODAY WILL BE ENOUGH FOR MOSUNNY SKIES WITH 
EXCEPTION OF CENTRAL OH WHERE LEFTOVER LLVL MOISTURE WILL HELP POP 
CU FOR MUCH OF THE DAY. 

MAIN QUESTION TO FCST IS WHATS COMING UP WED PM. BELIEVE THAT THE 
PROXIMITY OF FAR SERN FCST AREA TO SFC LOW WILL BRING SOME ACCUM 
SNOWFALL, WITH KY AND IMMEDIATE OH RIVER VLY BEARING THE BRUNT OF 
WINTER WX. INVERTED TROFS LIKE THIS APPROACHING SYSTEM HAVE NOT HAD 
PRECIP AS FAR NW AS EXPECTED AND I FEEL THAT MUCH OF FCST AREA WILL 
ONLY SEE SOME FLURRIES AT BEST, ESP N OF I-70 W OF CMH. SRN FCST 
AREA IS RIGHT AT THE NRN EDGE OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WITH A H8 
CALL OVER REGION AND DRYING EASTERLY WINDS BELOW IT. 

WILL GO CATEGORICAL IN POPS OVER THE S SINCE SNOW WILL OCCUR AND 
TAPER TO 20 POPS IN THE N WITH NO MENTION OF PRECIP. 

FOR TEMPS, WILL TREND TOWARDS COOLER AVN AS UPCOMING AIRMASS TODAY 
AND AFTER PRECIP EVENT LOOKS TO BE QUITE DRY. NO CHANGES TO EXTENDED.

WILL NOT GO WITH A 3RD PD ADVY TODAY SINCE NRN EDGE OF SNOW SHIELD 
IS STILL A BIT IN QUESTION AND QPF AMOUNTS ARE PROBABLY A BIT ON THE

WILL BECOME MSTLY CLDY THIS EVNG NORTH OF I-70 AS THIS BAND OF CLDS 
SHIFTS INTO THE REGION.  CLDS WILL NOT WORK INTO SOUTHERN ZONES 
UNTIL CLOSER TO MIDNIGHT.  GRADIENT RELAXES SOME OVERNIGHT AS SFC HI 
SHIFTS TOWARDS FLA PENISULA...BUT WINDS WILL LIKELY REMAIN IN THE 
BRISK CAT.  COMBINATION OF SW/W WINDS AND CLOUDS WILL KEEP TEMPS 
GENERALLY IN 30S OVERNIGHT.

AS ARCTIC FRNT PUSHES ACRS FCST AREA SAT...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL 
SPILL INTO OH VALLEY THROUGHOUT DAY.  CYCLONIC FLOW OFF GRT LKS WITH 
STRONG CAA AND DVLPG SHSN WILL CAUSE LITTLE IF ANY DIURNAL RISE IN 
TEMPS ACRS FCST AREA DURING MRNG HRS BEFORE TEMPS PLUMMET IN AFTN.  ONE 
EXCEPTION MAY BE IN SE COUNTIES...WHERE A LITTLE SUNSHINE MAY ALLOW 
FOR A FEW DEGREE RISE BEFORE NOON. SFC HI BUILDING INTO CNTRL PLAINS 
WILL ONCE AGAIN TIGHTEN GRADIENT ACRS OH VALLEY/LOWER GRT LKS.  
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDCG 25-35 KT 850 WINDS MIXING TO SFC DURING AFTN.  
THIS WOULD PUT FCST AREA ON BRINK OF ADVISORY CRITERIA...BUT WILL 
HOLD OFF ON ANY ISSUANCE ATTM.  SHSN WILL DVLP IN CYCLONIC FLO WITH 
BEST MOISTURE ACRS WAPOK/CMH GROUPS WHERE COULD EVEN SEE MINOR ACCUM.  
WILL PLACE HIGHEST POPS THESE LOCATIONS AND SCALE BACK TO SOUTH AND 
WEST.

LO PRES WILL TRACK INTO NORTHERN NEW ENGLAND BY SUN MORN WITH DEEP 
UPR TROF REMAINING IN PLACE ACRS REGION.  DEEP POLAR VORTEX WILL 
ROTATE AROUND BASE OF TROF AND INTO GRT LKS LATE SUN INTO MON.  
GFS/ETA DIFFER ON SPEED OF UPR LO AND DVLPMNT OF ASSOCD SFC 
FEATURES.  ETA DVLPS LO PRES SUN MORN AND TRACKS TO LK ONTARIO SUN 
NIGHT WHILE GFS ONLY INDCG SFC TROF WITH UPR LO. LEANING MORE 
TOWARDS MORE CONSISTENT GFS SOLN...WITH MORE CLDS AND COLD WX 
EXPECTED.  COULD STILL SEE A FEW FLURRIES ACRS NORTHERN ZONES...BUT 
AM OPTIMISTIC MAY SEE PTLY CLDY SKIES ACRS SW COUNTIES AS DRIER AIR 
NOSING INTO REGION.

TEMPS...GENERALLY WENT WITH SPLIT OF MAV/MET TEMPS TONIGHT AND 
SAT...AND REMAINED CLOSE TO MAV BEYOND.

EXTENDED...LOOKING LIKE LITTLE CHANGE IN UPR LVL PATTERN NEXT WEEK 
AS TROF REMAINS TO SOME DEGREE ACRS EASTERN CONUS.  PCPN CHC FOR

CLOUDY SKIES...EXCEPT MAYBE THE EXTREME SOUTHWEST...WHERE MOSTLY 
SUNNY SEEMS APPROPRIATE.  MAV TEMPERATURES MATCH LOCAL

AS FOR WINDS TODAY...AT 925 MODELS ARE PROGGING 35 TO 40 KTS...AND 
45 TO 50 AT 850 MB.  WILL UP THE WINDS TO 20 TO 30 TODAY AND WILL GO

STILL BRING QPF IN TONIGHT.  WILL KEEP MENTION OF CHANCE POPS

THICKNESS SUGGEST THAT PCPN WOULD START AS RAIN...THEN CHANGE OVER 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE FA.  ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTH IT WOULD BE RAIN 
ALL NIGHT LONG.  LOOKS LIKE THE WINDS TAPER OFF A LITTLE TONIGHT... 
WILL KEEP THE 15 TO 25 MPH.

NO REAL CHANGE FOR SATURDAY.  STRONG CAA WILL DROP TEMPERATURES OR 
KEEP THEM STEADY.  EXPECT SNOW SHOWERS OFF THE LAKES.  WINDS 20 TO 
30 STILL LOOK REASONABLE...SO WINDY WORDING WILL STAY.

HIGH BUILDS SOUTH A LITTLE QUICKER ON SUNDAY...BRINGING THE SURFACE 
WINDS MORE TO THE WEST.  THIS MIGHT CUT OFF FLURRIES ESPECIALLY IN

LOW CLOUDS FILLED BACK IN ACROSS FA LATE THIS MORNING AND EARLY THIS 
AFTERNOON. IT APPEARS ON VISIBLE SAT IMAGERY TO BE A COMBINATION OF 
CU AND STRATUS. BACK EDGE NOT THAT FAR TO THE W ACROSS WESTERN 
INDIANA AND APPEARS TO BE MORE DIURNAL IN THAT AREA. HOWEVER...BASED 
ON VERY STRONG INVERSION PRESENT ON 12Z ILN RAOB...NOT SURE HOW MUCH 
OF THIS WILL ACTUALLY DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET. WITH INCREASING 8H 
WINDS OVERNIGHT...EXPECT TO SEE SURFACE WINDS PICK UP A LITTLE IN 
WAA PATTERN. THIS MAY HELP TO ERODE SOME OF THE LOWER CLOUDS AT 
LEAST ACROSS THE WEST. SO FOR NOW...AM LEANING TOWARD A BECOMING 
PARTLY CLOUDY WEST AND KEEPING IT MOSTLY CLOUDY E FOR THE OVERNIGHT. 
A FEW FLURRIES SHOWING UP AROUND THE AREA SO MAY THROW IN AN EARLY 
MENTION FOR THAT THIS EVENING BUT WILL WAIT TIL ZONE ISSUANCE FOR 
FINAL DECISION. ALSO WITH WINDS PICKING UP A LITTLE...THINK WE WILL 
SEE OUR LOWS EARLY TONIGHT WITH TEMPS THEN STEADY OR SLOWLY RISING.

GOOD WAA ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE DAY ON FRIDAY ASSOCIATED WITH 
40 TO 60 KNOT 8H WINDS. THIS RESULTS IN SOME IMPRESSIVE ISENT LIFT 
ALONG THE 290-295K SURFACES. HOWEVER...MOISTURE IS LIMITED AND 
CONDENSATION PRESSURE DEFICITS REMAIN RATHER HIGH. WITH BEST 
MOISTURE ACROSS THE NORTH AND EAST...WILL HANG ON TO A LOW CHANCE 
POP FOR NE HALF OF FA AND KEEP SW HALF DRY. LOW LEVEL TEMP FIELDS 
COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW EARLY SO WILL MENTION STARTING AS A POSSIBLE 
MIX ACROSS WAPOK AND CMH AREAS BUT ANY PRECIP SHOULD QUICKLY CHANGE 
TO RAIN WITH STRONG WAA DEVELOPING.

GFS CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST CONSISTENT WITH STRENGTH AND TIMING OF 
DIGGING TROF ACROSS GREAT LAKES FOR THE WEEKEND AND WILL TREND 
FORECAST TOWARD ITS SOLUTION...ALTHO ETA ALSO FAIRLY SIMILAR. BOTH 
ETA AND GFS HAVE TRENDED A TAD FURTHER TO THE NE WITH DEEPER 
MOISTURE SO WILL TAPER BACK POPS A LITTLE ACROSS THE SW PORTIONS OF 
FA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. STILL THO...LOOKS LIKE LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
FRI NIGHT AND THEN 30-50 POPS FROM SW TO NE ACROSS FA ON SAT. 
CRITICAL THICKNESSES DROP OFF FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ACROSS FA BETWEEN 
06Z AND 12Z FRIDAY NIGHT/SAT MORNING. GOOD CAA ACROSS AREA ON 
SATURDAY WITH ETA AND GFS BOTH DROPPING 8H TEMPS INTO THE -12 TO -15 
DEGREE C RANGE BY 00Z SUN SO WILL GO WITH FALLING TEMPS DURING THE 
DAY. WITH CYCLONIC LOW LEVEL FLOW AND SOME 9H/8H CONVERGENCE...THINK 
WE WILL SEE SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA WITH BEST CHANCE 
ACROSS THE NE...IN AREA OF DEEPEST MOISTURE. TIME HEIGHT CROSS 
SECTION OF POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE AND WINDS INDICATES STRONG 
DOWNGLIDE FROM AROUND 09Z SAT THROUGH 21Z SAT AND IF THIS 
VERIFIES...SHOULD BE ABLE TO MIX 40 TO 50 KT WINDS DOWN FROM ABOUT 
750 MB. FOR NOW WILL GO WITH WINDY WORDING ON SATURDAY BUT MAY 
EVENTUALLY NEED A WIND ADVISORY IF THIS PANS OUT.

DEEPER MOISTURE LIFTS OFF TO THE NE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AND 
WILL TAPER SNOW SHOWERS OFF TO FLURRIES ACCORDINGLY. STILL PLENTY OF 
COLD AIR IN PLACE FOR SUNDAY WITH TEMPS REMAINING IN THE 20S.
UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES LESS AMPLIFIED THROUGH MONDAY BUT GFS 
TRYING TO BRING ANOTHER SHOT OF COLD AIR IN FOR LATER IN THE WEEK. 
LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES OFF THE GFS ONLY GIVING HIGHS IN THE TEENS TO 
LOWER 20S FOR WED AND THURS. THIS PROBABLY TOO COLD BUT WILL STILL 
TREND DOWN TEMPS IN THE EXTENDED SOME.

UPPER AIR PATTERN FEATURES A NORTHWESTERLY FLOW AT 500 MB.  500 MB 
HEIGHTS ARE FALLING TONIGHT AS ANOTHER TROF APPROACHES THE REGION.

SURFACE MAP HAS HIGH PRESSURE OVER MOST OF THE CONUS INCLUDING THE 
OHIO VALLEY.  COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
HIGH. 

SKY CONDITION IS RATHER TRICKY THIS EVENING WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
PROGGED TO ARRIVE BY 12Z. PARTLY CLOUDY LOOKS LIKE THE WAY TO GO 
SINCE I DONT EXPECT THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE TO ARRIVE UNTIL LATE 
TONIGHT.   

THOUGH A FEW CLOUDS ARE MOVING IN...TEMPS WILL FALL INTO THE TEENS 
TONIGHT AS PER CURRENT FORECAST. UPDATE WILL REMOVE EVENING SKY 
CONDITION WORDING AND THATS IT.

TO NORMAL VALUES. HOWEVER...COLD FRONT WILL DROP DOWN FRIDAY

SHOULD MOVE INTO THE FA AFTER MIDNIGHT...SO WILL GO MOSTLY CLOUDY

THANKS TO SDF, RNK, JKL, AND CLE FOR COORDINATION.

WILL ATTACK UPCOMING SNOW EVENT WITH A STRONGLY WORDED SPS SINCE 
MOST OF ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL WILL BE IN 3RD PERIOD OF TUES NIGHT. 
SFC LOW WILL TRACK SE OF FCST AREA AND CRIT THICKNESS OVER FAR SERN 
FCST AREA DONT CHANGE TO SNOW UNTIL AFTER 0Z. QPF IS BEST HERE BTWN 
0 AND 6Z WITH ANY ACCUM SNOWFALL ENDING BY 6-8Z HERE. DUE TO A LATE 
CHANGEOVER TO SNOW, DONT THINK THAT ACCUMS WARRANT A WATCH BUT 
COULD VERY WELL HIT ADVY CRITERIA. AM GOING 1-3 FOR MOST OF FCST 
AREA WITH EXPECTATIONS OF THE HEAVIEST BAND ABOUT 10-20 MI SE OF 
I-71 CORRIDOR BETWEEN CVG AND CMH. 

SNOW WILL LIKELY START TOWARDS NOON IN CVG AREA AND DAYTIME ACCUMS 
HERE SHOULD BE 1-2 INCHES WITH A DEFINITE CHANGEOVER TO RAIN FOR 
BRACKEN/BROWN COUNTY AREAS. ALL RAIN DURING THE DAY IN AND SOUTHEAST 
OF THESE COUNTIES. CHANGEOVER WILL LIKELY NOT OCCUR UNTIL A FEW 
HOURS AFTER SUNSET, BUT THERES A LOT THAT COULD SPEED THIS UP. 
FUTURE SHIFTS WILL MONITOR FOR EVAP COOLING NEAR THE LOW OR A 
QUICKER PUSH TO THE COLD AIR. ANY EASTWARD TREND TO THE TRACK OF THE 
LOW WILL ACCOMPLISH THE LATTER, BUT ALSO REDUCE QPF. 

WILL NOT CHANGE MUCH IN TEMPS, AND GO WITH NCEP FOLKS ON EXTENDED. 
EXTENDED WILL BE MOCLOUDY MOST OF FCST AREA WITH FEWER CLOUDS SW. 
TEMPS A BIT COOL. L/W TROF SHOULD REMAIN OVER OR JUST WEST OF FCST

REGIONAL RADAR SHOWING BROKEN LIGHT ECHOES STRETCHING FROM NORTHEAST 
TO SOUTHWEST ACROSS OHIO AND INDIANA. GENERAL TREND HAS BEEN FOR 
ECHOES TO DIMINISH AS WHAT FORCING THERE IS WEAKENS. CHANCE OF 
MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION LOOKS MINIMAL BUT WILL CARRY A MENTION FOR 
EARLY THIS MORNING ACROSS ABOUT NORTHWEST HALF OF THE AREA. WILL 
CALL IT SNOW NORTH OF I-70. BUT LOOKS IT COULD STILL BE RAIN OR A 
MIX FURTHER SOUTH AS PER OBSERVATIONS IN SOUTHERN INDIANA AND ALSO 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS. SO WILL MENTION RAIN AND SNOW IN SOUTHERN ZONE. 
FRONT IS STILL WORKING THROUGH SOUTHEASTERN ZONES AT THIS TIME BUT 
SHOULD BE THROUGH ENTIRE AREA BY EARLY MORNING HOURS. EXPECT 
TEMPERATURES TO STILL DROP SLIGHTLY AFTER DAYBREAK BUT IT APPEARS 
THAT THERE WILL BE A SMALL DIURNAL RISE.

FOCUS THEN SHIFTS TO STRONG SHORTWAVE THAT WILL BE APPROACHING THE 
AREA ON TUESDAY. GFS HAS COME INTO PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
ETA NOW AND MOST MODELS SEEM TO BE CLUSTERED AROUND THIS SOLUTION 
WITH THE NGM BEING A BIT SLOWER AND THE UNITED KINGDOM MODEL A BIT 
FASTER. AT THE SURFACE AN INVERTED TROUGH WILL DEVELOP IN THE AREA 
ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND LOW PRESSURE WILL EVENTUALLY TRACK JUST 
SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR THIS EVENT TO BE ALL SNOW. MODELS SHOWING A 
FAIR AMOUNT OF DRY AIR IN THE LOWER LEVELS THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON 
BUT BELIEVE THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH LIFT AND MOISTURE IN THE MID 
LEVELS TO GENERATE SNOW BY LATE IN THE DAY EXCEPT FOR PERHAPS 
CENTRAL OHIO. WILL JUST GO WITH CHANCE PROBABILITIES FOR NOW 
ALTHOUGH A QUICK LOOK AT THE 06Z ETA SHOWS MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION 
MOVING IN FASTER. FOR TUESDAY NIGHT WILL HAVE LIKELY PROBABILITIES 
FOR ALL BUT NORTHWEST ZONES. EXPECT ACCUMULATING SNOW BUT AT THIS 
TIME BELIEVE IT WOULD BE BELOW WATCH THRESHOLDS. SO WILL JUST 
MENTION THIS IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. FOR HIGHS AND LOWS

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES SURFACE TROF POKING INTO OHIO VALLEY.  
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CIRRUS MOVING INTO REGION WITH POST 
FRONTAL CLOUDS WELL BEHIND SURFACE TROF.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE GFS COMING IN LINE WITH 
ETA SOLUTION FOR SYSTEM TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY.  IN OTHER 
WORDS IT APPEARS THE NORTHERN STREAM WILL BREAK OFF AND NOT PHASE AS 
MUCH AS THE GFS HAS BEEN ADVERTISING. 

IN THE SHORTER TERM WILL KEEP RA/SN CONFINED TO WAPAK AND DAY ZONE 
GROUPS OVERNIGHT THEN HAVE MORNING POPS ACROSS THE NORTH WITH AMOUNT 
OF LIFT DECREASING ON MONDAY.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE FOR THE 
FIRST TWO PERIODS BUT WILL BUMP UP A COUPLE DEGREES ON MONDAY.  
HIGHS WILL LIKELY BE BY NOON MOST CASES THEN STEADY OR SLOWLY 
FALLING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.  HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR MONDAY 
NIGHT.  WITH THE FAST UPPER LEVEL FLOW (ALTHOUGH ANTI-CYCLONIC) OFF 
GREAT LAKES WILL GO WITH PARTLY CLOUDY.  AS UPPER LEVEL TROF DIGS 
INTO THE WEST...NORTHERN JET BREAKS TOWARDS OHIO VALLEY.  THIS WILL 
BRING SOME MOISTURE OUT OF THE GULF AND BRING A DESCENT CHANCE FOR 
SNOW TO ENTIRE FORECAST AREA WITH BEST AMOUNTS ACROSS SOUTH.  AT THE 
MOMENT WILL KEEP IT CHANCE POPS BUT HIGHER POPS WILL BE WARRANTED 
WITH MODEL CONSISTENCY.  WILL BUMP UP MAV LOWS MONDAY NIGHT WITH 
HIGHER TDS AND FEW CLOUDS EXPECTED. TUESDAY HIGH LOOK REASONABLE.

AS FOR THE EXTENDED...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO FA WED NIGHT WITH 
THE NEXT THREAT OF PRECIP COMING ON SAT/SUN.  MAN PROGS LOOK 
REASONABLE.

MODELS HAVE COME INTO REASONABLE AGREEMENT IN TIMING FRONT ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD MOVE INTO WESTERN SECTIONS 
THIS AFTERNOON. BUT IT WILL BE SLOW TO MAKE IT ACROSS THE REGION AS 
WEAK LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS IN THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY AND TRACKS 
NORTHEAST ALONG THE BOUNDARY THROUGH THE NIGHT. RATHER LIMITED 
MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND WITH JUST SOME THIN HIGH CLOUDS 
EXPECT MANY AREAS TO BE MOSTLY SUNNY THROUGH THE DAY.

LOW TO MID LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES BEHIND THE FRONT. BUT FORCING 
CONTINUES TO LOOK QUITE WEAK AS SHEARED SHORT WAVE BRUSHES BY TO THE 
NORTH. WILL HAVE LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES FOR ABOUT THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE AREA FROM LATE TONIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING. STILL SOME 
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN THERMAL PROFILES BUT IT APPEARS THAT ANY 
PRECIPITATION THAT MIGHT OCCUR SHOULD BE SNOW. HOWEVER CANNOT RULE 
OUT SOME RAIN AT THE ONSET SO WILL KEEP MENTIONING BOTH 
PRECIPITATION TYPES.

SYSTEM WILL BE FAST MOVING WITH THE CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION OVER BY 
MIDDAY. LOW CLOUDS WILL HANG AROUND A LITTLE LONGER BUT EXPECT THEM 
TO START CLEARING FROM THE WEST LATE IN THE DAY AND CONTINUE TO 
DECREASE MONDAY NIGHT. FOR TEMPERATURES IT SEEMED THAT THE MAV 
NUMBERS WERE PRETTY GOOD FOR TODAY. BUT FOR LATER PERIODS BELIEVE 
THAT COLD BIAS IS APPARENT SO FORECAST IS A FEW DEGREES WARMER FOR 
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.

QUITE A BIT OF DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE ETA AND GFS HEADING TOWARDS 
MIDWEEK. THIS RESULTS FROM THE WAY THE MODELS ARE HANDLING ENERGY 
DROPPING OUT OF CANADA INTO THE PLAINS. APPEARS THAT GFS IS TRYING 
TO PHASE THIS ENERGY WITH DEVELOPING CLOSED LOW IN THE SOUTHWEST 
UNITED STATES WHICH DOES NOT SEEM LIKELY. ETA KEEPS SEPARATION 
BETWEEN SYSTEMS WHICH RESULTS IN A SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE MOVING 
FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. 
THE ETA IS SUPPORTED BY LATEST CANADIAN/EUROPEAN/UNITED KINGDOM 
MODEL SOLUTIONS. HOWEVER IT DOES APPEAR THAT THE ETA IS OVERDONE IN 
ITS SURFACE RESPONSE. NONETHELESS WILL ADD A CHANCE OF SNOW IN 
WESTERN ZONES FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND AREAWIDE ON TUESDAY NIGHT.

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS CLEARING OF LOW CLOUDS NOW JUST MOVING INTO 
FAR WESTERN SECTIONS. HOWEVER JUST AS THIS IS OCCURRING HIGH AND MID 
CLOUDS ARE RAPIDLY MOVING IN FROM THE NORTHWEST. ALTHOUGH QUITE 
PROGRESSIVE MID LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD AFFECT THE AREA INTO THE 
AFTERNOON AND THERE COULD BE A PERIOD OF LOWER CLOUDS TRAILING THE

CLOUDY. FAR SOUTHWEST ZONES HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF GETTING A DECENT 
PERIOD OF SUNSHINE. EXPECT MUCH OF THE CLOUD COVER TO DIMINISH 
DURING THE EVENING.

MODEL SOLUTIONS STILL HAVE TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM 
TO AFFECT THE REGION. ETA CONTINUES TO BE FASTER IN PUSHING A FRONT 
THROUGH THE AREA ON SUNDAY WHILE THE GFS LAGS BEHIND BY ALMOST 18 
HOURS. A COMPROMISE SEEMS IN ORDER BUT LEANING A LITTLE MORE TOWARDS 
THE ETA MOVEMENT. BOTH MODELS AGREE THAT THERE WILL ONLY BE WEAK 
LIFT MOVING ACROSS THE REGION FROM LATER SUNDAY INTO MONDAY AS SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY PASSES BY TO THE NORTH. BUT WITH INCREASING MOISTURE 
CANNOT RULE OUT SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION AND WILL HOLD ON TO LOW 
CHANCE PROBABILITIES. PRECIPITATION TYPE IS A QUESTION BECAUSE OF 
THE MODEL DIFFERENCES IN TIMING THE ARRIVAL OF THE COLDER LOW LEVEL 
AIRMASS. MENTIONING RAIN AND SNOW SEEMS TO BE SAFER WAY TO GO FOR 
MOST PLACES UNTIL THERE IS A LITTLE CLEARER SIGNAL ON WHICH SOLUTION 
IS BETTER.

SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A TROF AXIS FROM WRN MICHIGAN INTO WRN 
ILLINOIS.  A TONGUE OF 40 PLUS DEWPOINTS WAS NOTED ADVECTING AHEAD 
OF THIS TROF INTO THE WRN CWFA.

WITH THE TONGUE OF 40 PLUS DEWPOINTS ADVECTING INTO THE WRN CWFA AND 
ALONG WITH CLEAR SKIES...FOG AND STRATUS HAVE FORMED.  AS OF 
NOW...THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH TURBULENT MIXING TO PREVENT ANY 
WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG...SO I AM NOT PLANNING ON ISSUING ANY 
ADVISORIES...BUT WILL KEEP A WATCH ON THE SITUATION FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT.  IN THE ERN CWFA...STRATOCUMULUS AND MID AND 
HIGH LVL MSTR SHOULD KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY DURING THE MORNING.  
BY AFTERNOON...ALL LOCATIONS SHOULD BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY EXCEPT 
PERHAPS THE FAR NRN MIAMI VLY.  TEMPS WILL AGAIN BE MILD TODAY.

ETA/GFS CONTINUE TO OSCILLATE WITH SFC FEATURES OVER THE NEXT 24 TO

CONSISTENT IN ITS MODEL TRENDS.  THUS...WILL LEAN TOWARD THIS 
SOLUTION.  DIGGING S/WV ENERGY FROM MANITOBA INTO THE NRN PLAINS 
WILL DEVELOP A CLOSED AREA OF LOW PRES AT THE H5 LVL.  THIS IN TURN

DEVELOPING COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH THE CWFA OVERNIGHT.  THAT 
SAID...A FEW SHOWERS COULD BREAK OUT AHEAD OF THE DEVELOPING COLD 
FRONT LATE THIS AFTN IN THE DAYTON AND WAPAKONETA ZONE GROUPS.  
ELSEWHERE...CONDITIONS SHOULD REMAIN DRY.  BY THIS EVENING...GOOD 
SFC TO 925 MB CONV SETS UP IN THE WRN CWFA.  WILL GO SHOWERS LIKELY 
NW WITH A CHC ELSEWHERE.  SINCE I WILL BE EMPLOYING THE GFS 
SOLUTION...COLDER AIR WILL CHANGE RAIN SHOWERS TO SNOW SHOWERS LATE 
IN THE DAYTON/WAPAKONETA/CINCINNATI ZONES...AND DURING THE MID TO 
LATE MORNING HOURS ON FRIDAY IN COLUMBUS AND PORTSMOUTH.  LOWS 
OVERNIGHT WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER 30S WEST WITH MID TO UPPER 30S 
EAST.  TEMPERATURE RECOVERY WILL BE AT A MINIMUM ON FRIDAY AS CLOUDY 
SKIES AND 850 MB CONV ON THE BACK SIDE OF SFC LOW PRESSURE PROVIDE 
FOR SNOW SHOWERS.  ATTM...I AM NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF 
ACCUMULATION...LESS THAN AN INCH...DUE TO TEMPERATURES NEAR 35 
DEGREES. IT WILL BECOME WINDY LATE TONIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE ON 
FRIDAY AS SFC PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS AND CAA ALLOWS FOR MOMENTUM

SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A TROF AXIS FROM WRN MICHIGAN INTO WRN 
ILLINOIS.  A TONGUE OF 40 PLUS DEWPOINTS WAS NOTED ADVECTING AHEAD 
OF THIS TROF INTO THE WRN CWFA.

WITH THE TONGUE OF 40 PLUS DEWPOINTS ADVECTING INTO THE WRN CWFA AND 
ALONG WITH CLEAR SKIES...FOG AND STRATUS HAVE FORMED.  AS OF 
NOW...THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH TURBULENT MIXING TO PREVENT ANY 
WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG...SO I AM NOT PLANNING ON ISSUING ANY 
ADVISORIES...BUT WILL KEEP A WATCH ON THE SITUATION FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT.  IN THE ERN CWFA...STRATOCUMULUS AND MID AND 
HIGH LVL MSTR SHOULD KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY DURING THE MORNING.  
BY AFTERNOON...ALL LOCATIONS SHOULD BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY EXCEPT 
PERHAPS THE FAR NRN MIAMI VLY.  TEMPS WILL AGAIN BE MILD TODAY.

ETA/GFS CONTINUE TO OSCILLATE WITH SFC FEATURES OVER THE NEXT 24 TO 
36 HOURS.  HOWEVER...IN THE UPPER LVLS...THE GFS HAS BEEN THE MOST 
CONSISTENT IN ITS MODEL TRENDS.  THUS...WILL LEAN TOWARD THIS 
SOLUTION.  DIGGING S/WV ENERGY FROM MANITOBA INTO THE NRN PLAINS 
WILL DEVELOP A CLOSED AREA OF LOW PRES AT THE H5 LVL.  THIS IN TURN 
WILL DEVELOP A SFC LOW OVER OHIO THIS EVENING AND INTO TONIGHT.  A 
DEVELOPING COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH THE CWFA OVERNIGHT.  THAT 
SAID...A FEW SHOWERS COULD BREAK OUT AHEAD OF THE DEVELOPING COLD 
FRONT LATE THIS AFTN IN THE DAYTON AND WAPAKONETA ZONE GROUPS.  
ELSEWHERE...CONDITIONS SHOULD REMAIN DRY.  BY THIS EVENING...GOOD 
SFC TO 925 MB CONV SETS UP IN THE WRN CWFA.  WILL GO SHOWERS LIKELY 
NW WITH A CHC ELSEWHERE.  SINCE I WILL BE EMPLOYING THE GFS 
SOLUTION...COLDER AIR WILL CHANGE RAIN SHOWERS TO SNOW SHOWERS LATE 
IN THE DAYTON/WAPAKONETA/CINCINNATI ZONES...AND DURING THE MID TO 
LATE MORNING HOURS ON FRIDAY IN COLUMBUS AND PORTSMOUTH.  LOWS 
OVERNIGHT WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER 30S WEST WITH MID TO UPPER 30S 
EAST.  TEMPERATURE RECOVERY WILL BE AT A MINIMUM ON FRIDAY AS CLOUDY 
SKIES AND 850 MB CONV ON THE BACK SIDE OF SFC LOW PRESSURE PROVIDE 
FOR SNOW SHOWERS.  ATTM...I AM NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF 
ACCUMULATION...LESS THAN AN INCH...DUE TO TEMPERATURES NEAR 35 
DEGREES. IT WILL BECOME WINDY LATE TONIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE ON 
FRIDAY AS SFC PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS AND CAA ALLOWS FOR MOMENTUM 
TRANSFER OF 30 KT WINDS FROM THE 925 MB TO THE SFC.

UPR LVL LOW MOVES EAST OF THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT.  A CHC OF 
FLURRIES WILL LINGER IN THE WEST UNTIL MIDNIGHT...AND FOR MOST OF

TEMPS ARE IN THE LOWER 40S.

ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS WITH THE 285K AND 290K SFC SUGGESTS THE PCPN 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE S/WV SHOULD HOLD OFF TILL JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT 
AND WEST AND BY 10Z OR SO IN THE EAST.  CURRENT FCST HAS LIKELY POPS 
IN WEST AND HIGH CHANCE IN THE EAST WHERE IT WILL BE LATE...AND THIS 
LOOKS REASONABLE.  LOW TEMPS TONIGHT WILL LIKELY OCCUR EARLY TONIGHT 
BEFORE THE LOW CLOUDS WORK IN.

THE RAIN WILL END WEST TO EAST EARLY TUESDAY MORNING.  SAT PR DEF 
PROFILE SHOWS MID AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FALLS OFF QUICKLY BEHIND 
S/WV.  SKIES SHOULD BECOME PC IN THE LATE MORNING/AFTERNOON.  ALL 
GUIDANCE TEMPS HAVE GONE UP SOMEWHAT WITH LATEST RUN...WITH THE MAV 
BEING THE COOLEST.  TEMPS SHOULD REACH THE LOW 50S ACROSS MUCH OF 
THE WEST WITH MORE OPTIMISTIC CLOUD COVER AND HIGHER LOW LEVEL 
THICKNESSES WORKING IN WITH ZONAL FLOW.  THE NEXT PCPN EVENT WILL 
BEGIN LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS A MID LEVEL LOW APPROACHES FROM THE NW.

FOR EXTENDED...THE MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH LATE WEEK 
MID LEVEL LOW.  HAVE LOWERED TEMPS SOMEWHAT FOR THE END OF WEEK AND 
WILL PUT IN CHANCE OF SNOW AND RAIN SHOWERS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS 
THE MID LEVEL LOW MOVES ACROSS GREAT LAKES REGION.  GFS SNDGS SHOW 
THAT FFO AT 4 PM THURSDAY EVEN TRENDS TOWARD RAIN SHOWERS...SO WILL 
KEEP SOUTH ALL LIQUID TIL LATE.  CONVERSELY...FRIDAY POINTS TOWARD 
ALL SNOW SHOWERS BUT WILL KEEP A MIX FOR NOW DUE TO UNCERTAINTY.

FRNT EXTNDG SW TO ANOTHER LO OVER SE KANSAS.  A LARGE AREA OF AC/CI 
HAD SPREAD ACRS OH VALLEY WITH LWR CLDS BACK ALONG AND BEHIND THE 
FRNTL BNDRY.  A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS WERE OCCURRING ACRS NORTHERN AND 
EASTERN PORTIONS OF OH.

THROUGH SUNDAY...ETA/GFS IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN TIMING OF FRNTL BNDRY 
AND EFFECTS IT WILL HAVE ON FCST AREA.  BOTH MODELS HAVE BEEN 
CONSISTENT WITH SLOWING FRNTL PASSAGE DOWN AND KEEPING QPF OUT OF 
FCST AREA FOR MUCH OF OVERNIGHT.  CLDS WILL CONTINUE TO THICKEN 
THROUGH THE NIGHT BUT WITH PCPN GENERALLY POSTFRONTAL (SUPPORTED 
BOTH BY MODELS AND CURRENT OBS)...ONLY EXPECT LO CHC POPS ACRS 
NORTHERN ZONES TOWARDS DAYBREAK.  FEEL CVG/PMH ZONES NOT LIKELY TO 
GET INTO PCPN UNTIL FRI MORN AS FRNTL BNDRY CROSSES REGION.

NOT OVERLY IMPRESSED WITH RAIN CHC FRI AS QPF VALUES ARE LOW AND 
BEST OMEGA VALUES REMAIN NORTH AND SOUTH OF FCST AREA.  AS DVLPG SFC 
LO ACRS TX BEGINS TO GET ITS ACT TOGETHER LATER IN THE AFTN...COULD 
SEE BETTER CHC FOR PCPN ACRS SOUTHERN ZONES.  NOT EXPECTING MUCH OF 
DIURNAL RISE WITH TEMPS AS STRONG CAA AND THICK CLD DECK REMAIN 
BEHIND FRNTL BNDRY.

DIFFERENCES IN MODELS BEGIN WITH TRACK OF AFOREMENTIONED GULF LO 
WHICH WILL BE MAJOR PLAYER IN WEEKEND WEATHER.  BOTH GFS/ETA 
AGGRESSIVE IN SPREADING PCPN BACK INTO FCST AREA FRI NIGHT AS LO 
TRACKS ACRS SE CONUS.  1000-850 THICKNESSES TICKLING 1300M ACRS NW 
COUNTIES AND WITH SFC TEMPS AT OR SLIGHTLY BLO FRZNG...WILL MENTION 
CHC SN ACRS WAPOK WITH POSSIBLE PERIOD RA/SN MIX AT DAY/CVG/CMH.  
LIKELY POPS WARRANTED ACRS ALL BUT WAPOK FRI NIGHT.

GFS TRACKS LO INTO SMOKY MTS SAT AFTN BEFORE TRANSFERRING ENERGY TO 
COASTAL LO SAT NIGHT AND SHOOTING NOREASTER UP ATL COAST.  ETA ON 
OTHER HAND TRACKS LO ALONG EAST SIDE OF APP MTS AND FURTHER WEST OF 
GFS TRACK INTO SUN.  IN LINE WITH HPC WILL TAKE BLEND OF MODEL 
TRACKS. BOTH MODELS BRING BEST OMEGA VALUES...MOISTURE AND LIFT 
ALONG AND EAST OF I-71 THROUGH THE DAY.  THE CONCERN IS PCPN TYPE 
PARTICULARLY DURING THE AFTN.  THICKNESSES DROP BLO 1300M ACRS WEST 
BEGINNING ERLY AFTN AND SPREADING EAST INTO THE EVNG.  THINK WAPOK 
COULD PRIMARILY SEE SN WITH CHC FOR RA MIX THROUGH ERLY AFTN.  
ELSEWHERE...PREDOMINANT PCPN TYPE WILL BE RA WITH CHANGEOVER TO SN 
PROBABLY OCCURRING LATE AFTN IN DAY/CVG/CMH ZONES AND LATER IN EVNG 
ACRS SE COUNTIES.

WITH TEMPS TUMBLING INTO 20S SAT NIGHT...EXPECT ALL SNOW ACRS FCST 
AREA.  STILL A LITTLE ERLY TO TELL REGARDING ACCUMULATIONS...BUT 
FEELING RIGHT NOW IS ANY AMTS WOULD BE LIGHT AS DEEPEST MOISTURE AND 
BEST OMEGA VALUES SHIFT TO EAST OF FCST AREA.  SNSH WILL CONTINUE 
INTO SUN AS UPR LO TRACKS ACRS REGION THROUGH DAY.  DRIER AIR WILL 
SLOWLY FILTER IN LATE SUN WHICH WILL ALLOW ANY SNSH TO END.

TEMPS...STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS THROUGH SAT NIGHT.  
FELT ETA TEMPS TOO WARM FRI BUT COME IN LINE WITH MAV IN LATER 
PERIODS.  FWC TEMPS TOO WARM SAT...LIKELY DUE TO NGM TRACKING LO UP

EXTENDED...LO PRES WILL TRACK ACRS SOUTHERN CANADA MON THRU 
WED...DRAGGING A WARM FRNT THROUGH REGION ERLY TUES AND WEAK COLD

COVER.  LOW PRESSURE WILL DEVELOP ALONG OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY EAST OF 
THE APPALACHIANS...BUT PCPN SHOULD STAY SE OF THE REGION.

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...SFC HIGH PRES IS FORECAST TO 
RIDGE INTO THE AREA...ALLOWING FOR SKIES TO BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY.

ON THURSDAY...ANOTHER S/WV AND ASSOCD COLD FRONT ARE EXPECTED TO 
MOVE SE TOWARD THE OHIO VLY.  MID AND HIGH LVL MSTR AHEAD OF SYSTEM 
SHOULD KEEP MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS PREVALENT.  A CHC OF SHOWERS

TIGHT GRADIENT WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA INTO SATURDAY 
NIGHT. THIS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL. THAT MUCH SEEMS 
FAIRLY CERTAIN. BUT MODELS SHOWING A FAIR AMOUNT OF VARIABILITY IN 
MOVEMENT OF UPPER LEVEL AND SURFACE FEATURES. GFS SEEMS A LITTLE TOO 
STRONG AND FAST WITH MOVING THROUGH ON SUNDAY. IN ADDITION NOT TOO 
SURE ABOUT THE SOLUTION FROM ITS LATEST RUN IN DEVELOPING A STRONG 
LOW MOVING UP THE WEST SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY.

SO IN THE NEAR TERM HAVE LEANED CLOSER TO THE ETA. INCREASING LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE LATE TONIGHT SHOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUDS 
ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS. THIS WILL THEN SPREAD ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
AREA DURING THE DAY. THE CLOUDS WILL LIMIT INSOLATION BUT WITH A 
MILD START BELIEVE THAT LOWER TO MID 60S STILL SEEMS REASONABLE. NOT 
TOO IMPRESSED WITH PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL SATURDAY AFTERNOON. BUT 
CANNOT RULE IT OUT SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE IN THE WEST. 

HIGHER PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS WILL BE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY. WAS TEMPTED TO GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS. BUT WITH SOME OF 
THE UNCERTAINTIES THAT HAVE BEEN SHOWING UP IN THE MODEL SOLUTIONS 
DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE. SO HAVE STUCK WITH LIKELY FOR 
BOTH PERIODS. WILL KEEP LINGERING CHANCE POPS INTO SUNDAY NIGHT WHEN 
FRONT IS EXPECT TO PASS. 

WILL BASE FORECAST FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY ON THE IDEA OF LOW 
PRESSURE DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE FRONT OCCURRING FURTHER SOUTH AND 
EAST AND NOT BEING NEARLY AS STRONG. SO PLAN ON LIMITING CHANCE OF 
RAIN TO SOUTHEASTERN ZONE. SHOULD BE IN BETWEEN SYSTEMS ON WEDNESDAY 
AND THURSDAY. THEN WILL ADD A CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN FOR FRIDAY AS 
MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE SUGGESTS ANOTHER FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING 
FROM THE WEST.

MODEL GUIDANCE IS ALL OVER THE BOARD AFTER A DECENT AGREEMENT

AHEAD OF CDFNT THAT GOES THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. ETA BRINGS CDFNT 
THROUGH A FULL 24 HOURS EARLIER. DPROG/DT ON AVN AT 0Z MON IS QUITE 
FURTHER WEST THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE ETA AND THEN 
THE PREVIOUS GFS RUN OF THE MRF THROUGH THE REST OF THE FCST. DONT 
BELIEVE THAT GUIDANCE WILL BE WORTH MUCH IF ANYTHING AFTER SUNDAY, 
SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR NEXT WEEK. 

WIDE OPEN GULF ON SAT AND SUN WITH STRONG LLJET WILL PROVIDE A GOOD 
CHANCE OF THUNDER ACROSS FCST AREA, AND CURRENT FCST HAS LIKEY POPS 
IN IT. ANOTHER SHOT OF RAIN EXPECTED ON TUESDAY WITH APPROACING SFC 
LOW AHEAD OF H5 TROF IN THE MIDWEST. WILL NOT MENTION THUNDER ATTM 
SINCE SOLUTIONS THIS FAR OUT ARE SKETCHY AT BEST, BUT CONTINUE 
LIKELY POPS THAT ARE ALREADY IN FCST.  WRAP AROUND FROM SYSTEM WOULD 
SUGGEST CHANCE POPS WITH RAIN CHANGING TO SNOW WED PM.

BREEZY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ACROSS FCST AREA THIS WEEKEND UNTIL 
NEXT SYSTEM COMES THORUGH. THIS WILL KEEP NIGHTTIME LOWS ON THE WARM

OHIO VALLEY AS A WELL DEVELOPED H5 TROF DIGS TOWARD THE GULF COAST.  
AS THE TROF PROGRESSES RAPIDLY EASTWARD SOUTH OF A STRONG HUDSON BAY 
VORTEX...FLOW WILL BECOME NORTHWEST AGAIN BY LATE WEDNESDAY.  

SFC MAP HAS HIGH CENTERED OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...WITH LOWS 
OVER THE EASTERN LAKES AND THE ROCKIES.  HIGH WILL PASS ACROSS OUR 
CWA TONIGHT.  PLENTY OF MOISTURE REMAINS TRAPPED IN LOW LEVELS...AND 
MODELS SUGGEST MOISTURE WILL PERSIST TONIGHT.  THEREFORE...ILL GO 
WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR TONIGHT. 

ROCKIES LOW IS PROGGED TO WHIP EASTWARD AHEAD OF THE H5 TROF TO THE 
OHIO VALLEY ON TUESDAY.  ETA AND AVN DIFFER IN PATH OF LOW WITH ETA 
SHOWING LOW AT 06Z WEDNESDAY ALONG THE OHIO-WEST VIRGINIA 
BORDER...WHILE AVN KEEPS LOW FARTHER SOUTH NEAR THE WEST 
VIRGINIA-VIRGINIA BORDER. BOTH MODELS PORTEND A WIDE SWATH OF RAIN 
OVER OUR CWA...WITH HEAVIER QPF INDICATED SOUTH NEAR THE OHIO 
RIVER.  CATEGORICAL RAIN FORECAST STILL LOOKS GOOD IN ALL ZONES 
EXCEPT WEST CENTRAL OHIO...WHERE ILL STAY WITH LIKELY POPS.  I WILL 
MENTION MID MORNING START TIME IN SOUTHERN ZONES WHERE THERE HAD 
PREVIOUSLY BEEN NO TIMING.  SINCE THE SYSTEM WILL BE EXITING TO THE 
EAST TUESDAY NIGHT...ILL USE MAINLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT WORDING IN OUR 
WESTERN ZONES...WHILE KEEPING THE SAME POPS.

MODELS SHOW PERSISTENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ON WEDNESDAY.  SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE SOME CAPE BETWEEN 5 AND 10 KFT...AND FAVORABLE WIND FIELDS 
ALONG WITH MARGINAL LAKE SURFACE-850 MB TEMP DIFFERENCE GIVE THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR A FEW SHRA.  THEREFORE...ILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN 
OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES...WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY FORECAST SOUTH.

TEMPS:  MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES SHOULD KEEP READINGS ABOVE MAV NUMBERS 
TONIGHT.  MAV APPEARS A BIT TOO COOL IN WARM ADVECTION AHEAD OF THE 
LOW ON TUESDAY...THEN A BIT WARM BEHIND THE SYSTEM ON WEDNESDAY.

EXTENDED:  SKIES WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD. 
GFS AND 03/12Z ECMWF SHOW AN H5 RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS BY THE 
WEEKEND...WITH A WARM FRONT SETTING UP TO OUR NORTH OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES...SO TEMPS MAY FINALLY REBOUND TOWARD CLIMATOLOGICAL AVERAGES. 
00Z GFS SHOWS LOW TARGETING OHIO NEXT MONDAY...BUT THE 12Z GFS AT

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS WESTERN FA.  
REGIONAL RADARS INDICATE SHOWERS IN EASTERN FA CONTINUING TO MOVE 
EAST AND SHOULD BE EAST OF FA BY ZONE TIME.  SATELLITE IMAGERY 
INDICATES MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS AS FAR WEST KSPI AND KORD.

MODELS ARE ALL IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT.  THERE ARE SOME SUBTLE 
DIFFERENCES AROUND 60 HRS WITH 00Z GFS AND 12Z ECMWF BEING FASTEST 
WITH 500 MB TROF WITH 00Z UKMET AND ETA BEING SLOWEST.  SURFACE 
RESULTS ARE NOT THAT DRASTIC WITH ALL MODELS PUTTING TAKING LOW 
ACROSS EASTERN KY INTO WV.  THE ETA IS THE FARTHEST NORTH.  RUN TO 
RUN CONSISTENCY BELONGS TO AVN.  WILL STICK CLOSE TO AVN SOLUTION 
SYNOPTICALLY.

IN THE NEAR TERM...CONCERNED ABOUT CLOUD COVER.  CLEAR AIR IN 
NORTHERN IL WILL WORK TOWARDS FA TODAY.  BUT BELIEVE IT WILL FILL IN 
FOR THE MOST PART WITH WEAK CYCLONIC FLOW AND CU RULE KEEPING FA 
BROKEN THROUGH LATE AFTERNOON.  IT APPEARS GUIDANCE TRIES TO SCATTER 
CLOUDS OUT TO QUICK.  AS A RESULT WILL UNDER CUT MAV BY A DEGREE OR 
TWO TODAY.  LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS EVIDENT OVERNIGHT BUT WITH THE 
LOSS OF DAYTIME INSOLATION SKY COVER SHOULD BE PARTLY CLOUDY.  AS 
NEXT UPPER LEVEL TROF MOVES TOWARD OHIO VALLEY CYCLOGENESIS WILL 
TAKE PLACE JUST SOUTH OF TX TONIGHT WITH RESULTANT SURFACE LOW 
RACING TOWARD TN/LOWER OH VLY.  CLOUDS WILL THICKEN AND LOWER ON 
WEDNESDAY WITH RAIN SPREADING NORTHWARD ACROSS FA.  THIS APPEARS TO 
BE A CATEGORICAL RAIN.  RAIN WILL END FROM WEST TO EAST WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AS DRY SECTOR WORKS INTO FA.  WILL KEEP MENTION OF LAKE EFFECT 
RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS NORTH WITH MOISTURE STILL LINGERING, UPPER LEVEL 
TROF OVER REGION AND FLOW OFF THE LAKES.  AT THE MOMENT SNOW DOES 
NOT SEEM TO BE A PROBLEM AS 1000 TO 850 MB THICKNESS STAY ABOVE 1310.

ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST HALF OF FA. WILL GO WITH PARTLY 
CLOUDY CVG AREA AND THEN BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY FOR DAY-PMH GROUPS

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES SURFACE HIGH RIDGE POKING INTO SOUTHERN 
OHIO VALLEY.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CIRRUS AND ALTO STRATUS 
NORTH AND EAST OF FA. 

MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH ONLY A COUPLE SUBTLE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ETA AND GFS.  GFS IS A BIT QUICKER WITH 500 MB 
TROF 36 TO 60 HRS.  ETA IS FASTER ND DEEPER WITH SURFACE LOW MOVING 
ACROSS GREAT LAKES SUNDAY NIGHT THAN THE GFS.  UKMET IS IN CLOSE 
AGREEMENT WITH GFS.  THANKFULLY, THESE DIFFERENCES MAKE LITTLE 
DIFFERENCE IN THE ACTUAL FORECAST. 

DRY AND STABLE AIR WILL BRING MO SUNNY SKIES TO FA TODAY.  HIGHS 
WERE A BIT TOUGH WITH GUIDANCE RANGING FROM LO TO MID 40 TO LO TO 
MID 50S.  AFTER EVALUATING UPSTREAM TEMPS AND LOW LEVEL THERMAL 
PATTERNS WILL GO A BIT WARMER THAN THE COLDER MAV.  CLOUDS WILL

ACROSS FA WITH GOOD UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT.  WILL TAKE OUT MENTION OF 
SNOW ACROSS MUCH OF FA FOR NOW.  1000-850 MB THICKNESSES WARM

BEGINNING AS SNOW THEN QUICKLY GOING TO RAIN.  1540 (850 TO 700 MB) 
BISECTS FA ALL NIGHT.  WILL MENTION IN WAPAK AND CMH GROUP POSSIBLY

AM SENDING CORRECTIONS OUT TO INCLUDE RAIN SHOWERS EXPECTED

WILL HAVE TO INCLUDE A FREEZE WATCH FOR N 1/2 OF FCST AREA TONIGHT 
SINCE IVE GOT 33 IN THE BOOKS FOR TEMPS.

WEAK SFC CONVERGENCE OVER IL/IN WILL MAKE ITS WAY S OF FCST AREA 
THIS MORNING. COMBINED WITH W-E ORIENTED VORT, WILL MENTION 
POSSIBILITY OF SPRINKLES, MAINLY WRN PART OF FCST AREA. 
HOWEVER...DRIER AIR THAT FILTERED IN EARLIER SHOULD KEEP ANY 
SPRINKLES OUT OF THE NORTHWEST SO WILL JUST MENTION THEM IN THE 
SOUTHWEST CVG GROUP. NO PRECIP EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS THOUGH 
I CANT RULE OUT A FEW COLD AIR INSTABILITY SHOWERS. 

NW FLOW SETS UP AND BRINGS IN COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON LATER IN THE 
DAY FRIDAY AND ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT. SFC WINDS ARE PROGGED TO BE 
MORE WLY THAN NW ON BOTH FRI AND SAT BUT SHOULD REMAIN AROUND THE 15 
MPH RANGE DURING THE DAY WITH SOME MIXING. NIGHTTIME DECOUPLING IS 
EXPECTED UNDER INVERSION SO WINDS SHOULD RELAX SIGNIFICANTLY 
OVERNIGHT. 

MAV GUIDANCE HAS BEEN QUITE REASONABLE ON THIS STRING OF SHIFTS, AND 
IM GOING TO FOLLOW IT FOR ANOTHER FORECAST CYCLE, WHICH IS IN LINE 
WITH CURRENT FCST. THIS WILL BRING OUR FREEZE OUTLOOK FOR FRIDAY 
NIGHT INTO THE WATCH RANGE, AND DAYSHIFT SHOULD SWITCH THIS TO A

AM SENDING CORRECTIONS OUT TO INCLUDE RAIN SHOWERS EXPECTED

WILL HAVE TO INCLUDE A FREEZE WATCH FOR N 1/2 OF FCST AREA TONIGHT 
SINCE IVE GOT 33 IN THE BOOKS FOR TEMPS.

WEAK SFC CONVERGENCE OVER IL/IN WILL MAKE ITS WAY S OF FCST AREA 
THIS MORNING. COMBINED WITH W-E ORIENTED VORT, WILL MENTION 
POSSIBILITY OF SPRINKLES, MAINLY WRN PART OF FCST AREA. 
HOWEVER...DRIER AIR THAT FILTERED IN EARLIER SHOULD KEEP ANY 
SPRINKLES OUT OF THE NORTHWEST SO WILL JUST MENTION THEM IN THE 
SOUTHWEST CVG GROUP. NO PRECIP EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS THOUGH 
I CANT RULE OUT A FEW COLD AIR INSTABILITY SHOWERS. 

NW FLOW SETS UP AND BRINGS IN COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON LATER IN THE 
DAY FRIDAY AND ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT. SFC WINDS ARE PROGGED TO BE 
MORE WLY THAN NW ON BOTH FRI AND SAT BUT SHOULD REMAIN AROUND THE 15 
MPH RANGE DURING THE DAY WITH SOME MIXING. NIGHTTIME DECOUPLING IS 
EXPECTED UNDER INVERSION SO WINDS SHOULD RELAX SIGNIFICANTLY 
OVERNIGHT. 

MAV GUIDANCE HAS BEEN QUITE REASONABLE ON THIS STRING OF SHIFTS, AND 
IM GOING TO FOLLOW IT FOR ANOTHER FORECAST CYCLE, WHICH IS IN LINE 
WITH CURRENT FCST. THIS WILL BRING OUR FREEZE OUTLOOK FOR FRIDAY

COLD PATTERN TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE NEXT WEEK. ALTHOUGH THERE 
SHOULD BE SOME PERIODS OF MODERATION...THAT WILL ONLY LEAD TO 
TEMPERATURES BEING JUST SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.

SHORT TERM CONCERN IS THE CLOUD FORECAST. SATELLITE IMAGERY HAS BEEN 
INDICATING THAT CLEARING OF LOW CLOUDS HAS BEEN VERY SLOWLY MOVING 
SOUTHWARD TODAY. MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE LAYER OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
WILL BE DECREASING OVERNIGHT. EXPECT SOME BREAKS TO WORK INTO 
NORTHERN ZONES AND THEY COULD EVEN BECOME SIGNIFICANT. HOWEVER MID 
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE STREAMING OUT AHEAD OF A SHORT WAVE MOVING 
OUT OF THE MIDWEST. SO MID CLOUDS SHOULD MOVE OVER TOP OF THE LOW 
DECK OR WHAT IS LEFT OF IT. AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER WILL HAVE IMPACT 
ON LOW TEMPERATURES. IF CLEARING DEVELOPS AND LASTS FOR SEVERAL 
HOURS THEN READINGS COULD FALL TO OR BELOW FREEZING. HOWEVER THERE 
IS MUCH LESS THAN AN 80 PERCENT CONFIDENCE IN THIS HAPPENING WHICH 
IS THE THRESHOLD REQUIRED FOR A FREEZE WARNING. SO WILL KEEP 
TEMPERATURES IN NORTHERN ZONES JUST ABOVE FREEZING.

MAIN LIFT WITH THE SHORT WAVE LOOKS LIKE IT WILL PASS TO THE NORTH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA TOMORROW SO WILL KEEP PRECIPITATION OUT OF THE 
FORECAST. THEN AN IMPULSE ROTATES AROUND THE HUDSON BAY VORTEX 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL USHER IN THE 
COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON THUS FAR. HOWEVER PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL 
LOOKS SLIM AS LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BE WEST OR WEST NORTHWEST. EXPECT 
A HARD FREEZE ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
WILL REISSUE THE FREEZE OUTLOOK. LOOKS LIKE LOW CLOUDS SHOULD 
FINALLY CLEAR OUT SATURDAY OR SATURDAY EVENING. MAV TEMPERATURES 
LOOK PRETTY GOOD AND DID NOT DEVIATE VERY FAR FROM THEM.

THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL APPROACH FROM THE WEST ON SUNDAY AND CROSS THE 
REGION SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS COULD POSSIBLY LINGER INTO MONDAY MORNING 
BUT WITH TIMING UNCERTAINTY WILL LIMIT MENTION OF PRECIPITATION TO 
JUST THE SUNDAY PERIOD. ALSO APPEARS THAT TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM 
ENOUGH FOR PRECIPITATION TYPE TO BE RAIN. THERE COULD BE ANOTHER 
SYSTEM APPROACHING LATE ON WEDNESDAY AS WELL. BUT THIS MAY BE 
MOISTURE STARVED AS A RAIN EVENT MAY ALREADY BE OCCURRING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST AT THAT TIME.

OR TWO FOR REST OF AFTN.  WILL MENTION EARLY WORDING CMH/WAPOK ZONES 
TO END SCT -SHRA/DZ...OTHERWISE WILL GO DRY OVERNIGHT.

LO PRES WILL SHIFT INTO CAROLINAS BY WED MORN AND MERGE WITH DVLPG 
LO PRES OVER SE CONUS.  GFS HAS BEEN BETTER IN HANDLING TRACK AND 
MOVEMENT OF LO...AND WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW ITS SOLN THROUGH THURS

AS AMPLE AMTS LO LVL MOISTURE ON MODEL SOUNDINGS INTO WED NIGHT.  
GFS IN PARTICULAR TRYING TO SPIT OUT LIGHT QPF ACRS NORTHERN AND 
EASTERN PORTIONS OF FCST AREA WED...BUT NOT MUCH FORCING/LO LVL 
CONVERGENCE TO WORK WITH.  JUST DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE IN ANY 
PCPN FALLING...SO WILL CONTINUE DRY FCST FOR WED. CURRENT SAT TRENDS 
EXTNDG STRATUS BACK INTO SOUTHERN PLAINS WOULD SUPPORT CONTINUED 
CLOUD COVER ACRS FCST AREA.  APPEARS TO BE SOME DRYING BELOW 850 MB 
WED NIGHT INTO THURS WHICH MAY ALLOW CLOUDS TO BREAK UP A LITTLE.  
WILL CONTINUE MSTLY CLDY WORDING FOR THESE TWO PERIODS.

TEMPS THRU THURS A BIT OF A CHALLENGE CONSIDERING EXPECTED CLOUD 
COVER.  NOT A WHOLE LOT OF TEMP SPREAD EXPCTD TONIGHT AND WED.  
POSSIBILITY OF A THINNING OF CLOUD COVER WED NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MAY 
ALLOW FOR A BIT OF A LARGER SPREAD.  WITH GENERALLY SAME AIRMASS ON 
WED IN PLACE FOR THURS...WILL GO DEGREE OR TWO WARMER FOR THURS 
HIGHS.  BOTH GFS/ETA SLOWER WITH COLD FRNT NOT APPCHG REGION UNTIL 
ERLY FRI.  WILL REMOVE MENTION OF PCPN THURS NIGHT ALL BUT WEST 
CNTRL OH ZONE WHICH MAY SEE SNSH DVLP LATE.  BOTTOM FALLS OUT ON 
TEMPS WITH FRNTL PASSAGE ON FRI AS TRULY COLD AIRMASS OVERSPREADS

TEMPS...STAYED CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS THRU THURS NIGHT AS BOTH FWC/MET

THANKS TO SDF FOR COORD.

WILL THROW IN A MENTION OF THUNDER TODAY ACROSS S 1/2 OF FCST AREA, 
MAINLY ALONG AND SOUTH OF OHRIVER. LARGE AREA OF THETA E CONVERGENCE 
COOINCIDES WITH H8 LOW CURRENTLY OVER SCTL MO. THERES A DEFINITE H8
AXIS NOTED OVER SRN FCST AREA AT 18 AND 0Z TODAY, AND THETA E IS 
PRETTY STRONG ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE LOW. THIS IS ALSO WITH A 
SMALL BUT STRONG VORT AXIS LEFT OVER FROM A WEAK S/W MOVING NE 
THROUGH FCST AREA.

SKY COVER IS PRETTY EASY THROUGH FIRST SEVERAL PERIODS. CLOUDY. 
AFTER THE RAIN TODAY, SOME SPRINKLES ARE POSSIBLE TONIGHT IN THE 
CAA. WILL MENTION THE SPRINKLES IN TONIGHTS FCST. POSSIBILITY FOR 
SPRINKLES WILL HANG ON THROUGH WED AND WED PM, BUT CONFIDENCE ON 
TRACE EVENTS THIS FAR OUT IS LOW AND WILL NOT WORD THE FORECAST WITH 
THEM AFTER TONIGHT. 

TEMPS ARE TROUBLESOME. A STRONG GRADIENT EXPECTED TODAY IN THE 
SOUTHEAST WITH STRONG WINDS KEEPING UP OVERNIGHT LOWS. NOT MUCH 
RECOVERY EXPECTED IN THE N 1/2 OF FCST AREA TODAY. AM LEANING 
TOWARDS THE COOLER MAV GUIDANCE FOR WEDNESDAY, AND THINK THAT IT MAY 
EVEN BE COOLER THAN THIS. ATTM, WILL STICK RIGHT AT MAV NUMBERS. 
OTHER MODELS ARE TOO WARM. WILL HAVE TO INCLUDE FREEZE ACROSS FCST 
AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND INCLUDE AS AN OUTLOOK UNDER HWO AND SPS. 
DEPENDING ON WHAT DIRECTIVES SAY, I MIGHT HAVE TO INCLUDE OUTLOOK 
FOR THURS PM AS WELL SINCE MODELS ARE HINTING AT -4 TO -6 H8 AIRMASS 
OVER MUCH OF FCST AREA. WITH OVC SKIES, YOU COULD ADD 3 OR 4 DEG C 
TO THESE NUMBERS FOR LOWS, WHICH STILL PUTS IT IN AN OUTLOOK

GFS/ETA IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT OVER NEXT FEW DAYS WITH MAIN WX

HIGHS A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN TUES.  DOES APPEAR TO BE SOME DRYING 
WED NIGHT/THURS WITH UPR TROF OVER CANADA/NORTHERN GRT LKS BEGINNING

ACTIVE PATTERN OVER THE AREA INTO THE WEEKEND.

IT ALL STARTS WITH THE CURRENT AREA OF RAIN OVER THE SOUTHERN FA.  
THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT AT 300K AND 305K.  THIS LIFT 
IS COMBINING WITH UPPER DIVERGENCE FROM RIGHT REAR QUAD OF 300MB 
JET.  THE ISENTROPIC LIFT SHUT OFF QUICKLY BY 12Z...BUT A LITTLE 
UPPER DIVERGENCE LINGERS ACROSS THE AREA.

FIRST OF TWO INVERTED TROFS SLIDES ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES 
TODAY.  THE BULK OF THIS MOISTURE SHOULD STAY SOUTH OF THE FA.  NEXT 
LOW THEN DEVELOPS TONIGHT AND PUSHES PRECIP INTO THE FA TONIGHT.  
THIS IS QUICKER THAN 12Z MODELS.  LOW TRACKS ACROSS KY ON 
TUESDAY...SPREADING AREA OF RAIN ACROSS THE FA.  LOW PULLS OFF 
TUESDAY NIGHT...LEAVING THE FA WAITING FOR THE BIG PUSH OFF COLD AIR 
THAT WILL AFFECT THE FA LATE IN THE WEEK.

LOOKING AT RADAR...IS APPEARS THAT POPS WILL BE NECESSARY ACROSS THE 
SOUTH.  BASED ON LIFT...WILL KEEP IT DURING THE MORNING.  WILL LOOK 
AT RADAR AT ISSUE TIME TO DECIDE IF RAIN IS NECESSARY ELSEWHERE.

WILL BRING RAIN BACK INTO THE FA AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...THEN WILL 
GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS.  WONT MENTION THUNDER ON TUESDAY RIGHT NOW.

HAVE BEEN TOO WARM THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...SO WILL GO WITH HIGHS 
CLOSE TO CONSISTENCY...WHICH MATCH MAV.  MAV LOWS LOOK TOO 
COLD...WILL GO A CATEGORY HIGHER TONIGHT AND TUESDAY NIGHT.

CLEMISILN OUT LATER.

KEEP TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 40S FOR THE MOST PART. 

FOR TODAY...ETA 295K ISENTROPIC SFC SHOWS BEST LIFT WITH BELOW 20 MB

NOT ENCROACH INTO CVG.  HOWEVER...ANOTHER VORT AXIS SWINGS THROUGH

EXPECTED.  AFTER THIS CHANCE OF RAIN ENDS...SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE SAT 
PR DEFS WITH LIFT MOVE INTO THE FCST AREA AROUND 6Z TONIGHT...BUT 
EXPECT MAIN PCPN TO HOLD OFF TILL FRIDAY AFTERNOON.   

FOR FRIDAY...ETA AND GFS SNDG PROFILES SHOW DEEP MOISTURE AND GOOD

ALREADY FALLEN INTO U30S.  CURRENT FCST TEMPS LOOK REACHABLE AND NOT 
PLANNING TO CHANGE.  MSTLY CLR WORDING WILL CONTINUE TO WORK...AC/CI

HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MID MS VLY AND OHIO VLY.  SATELLITE IMAGERY 
INDICATES SOME HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS OVER FA WITH THICKER CLOUDS OVER 
KY/WV/TN.

MODELS ARE ALL IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH 48 HOURS...THEN THE 
ETA/AVN BEGIN TO DIVERGE WITH THE UKMET SEEMING TO BE THE COMPROMISE

LOW OVER WESTERN GREAT LAKES AND IS A BIT SLOWER THAN THE AVN AND TO 
A LESSER EXTENT THE UKMET.  AS FOR SENSIBLE WEATHER THANKFULLY THIS 
DIFFERENCE DOES NOT REALLY TRANSLATE INTO THE FORECAST.  

IN THE NEAR TERM WILL ISSUE A FREEZE WARNING ACROSS ACROSS CENTRAL 
SECTIONS DOWN TO FRANKLIN, IN TO ROSS, OH LINE.  LIGHT WINDS ALONG 
WITH CLEAR SKIES WILL HELP TEMPS TO FALL TO NEAR OR BELOW LAST 
NIGHTS LOWS.  ACROSS SOUTHERN FA TEMPS WILL BE A BIT WARMER AND 
FROST ADVISORY WILL SUFFICE.  WEAK RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER FA THROUGH 
TUESDAY BRINGING LITTLE IN THE WAY OF CLOUDS THROUGH TUESDAY.  MAV 
IS IN PRETTY GOOD SHAPE.  IT SEEMS A LITTLE WARM WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS 
SO WILL BUMP DOWN A BIT.  WILL MENTION FROST THE NEXT TWO NIGHTS AS 
WELL.

AS FOR THE EXTENDED WILL TREND TOWARDS WETTER SOLUTION WITH SOUTHERN

RADAR SHOWING THAT PRECIPITATION HAS ENDED ACROSS ALL BUT THE FAR 
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE FORECAST AREA AND TRENDS SUGGEST THAT THIS 
SHOULD PUSH OFF TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA IN THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO. 

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATING THAT NORTHERN EDGE OF LOWER CLOUDS IS 
MAKING SOUTHWARD PROGRESS AS WELL. HOWEVER...HIGH CLOUDS ARE 
STREAMING EAST NORTHEAST INTO SOUTHERN ZONES. LOOKS LIKE HIGHER 
CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY AS UPPER SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS RAPIDLY MOVES EASTWARD.

MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW TREND OF PRECIPITATION AREA ASSOCIATED WITH 
THIS SYSTEM BEING A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH WITH EACH RUN. THIS SEEMS 
REASONABLE GIVEN HOW MUCH DRY AIR IS MOVING BEHIND THE FRONT. SO 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO GO WITH A DRY FORECAST TODAY. LOOKS LIKE LOW LEVEL 
FLOW TURNS MORE NORTHERLY LATE IN THE DAY WHICH COULD ALLOW SOME 
STRATOCUMULUS OFF OF LAKE ERIE TO APPROACH CENTRAL OHIO. WILL KEEP 
AN EYE ON THIS BUT WILL STAY ON THE OPTIMISTIC SIDE.

EXPECT MAINLY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT AND WITH TEMPERATURES FALLING INTO 
THE 30S COULD SEE SOME FROST. HOWEVER AM A BIT CONCERNED THAT THERE 
COULD BE A LITTLE WIND CONTINUING THROUGH THE NIGHT ESPECIALLY 
FURTHER TO THE SOUTH. SO WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE FROST IN THE 
FORECAST. BUT WITH CONFIDENCE LEVEL BELOW 80 PERCENT WILL HOLD OFF 
ON AN ADVISORY AND JUST MENTION IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.

NEXT SHORT WAVE IN THE NORTHERN STREAM LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HAVE 
LITTLE IF ANY EFFECT ON THE FORECAST AREA AS IT STAYS FURTHER NORTH 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT THE GRADIENT WILL BE 
WEAKER ON MONDAY NIGHT. SO THAT MAY END UP BEING A BETTER NIGHT FOR 
FROST AND PERHAPS EVEN SOME FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN RURAL AREAS OF 
CENTRAL OHIO.

OVERALL COULD NOT ARGUE MUCH WITH MAV TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE. SO

MOVING EASTWARD ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING. LOOKS LIKE JUST 
ABOUT THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA SHOULD GET SOME RAIN ALTHOUGH IT MAY 
BE A CLOSE CALL AS TO WHETHER RAIN WILL HAVE ENDED BEFORE DAYBREAK 
TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF DAYTON. LIGHTNING ACTIVITY HAS CEASED FOR 
THE TIME BEING AND FORECAST INSTABILITY DOES NOT LOOK LIKE MUCH. SO 
WILL JUST STICK WITH SHOWERS ALTHOUGH THUNDER IS NOT OUT OF THE 
QUESTION ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHERN ZONES.

WITH WINDS STAYING UP ALL NIGHT AND CLOUD COVER...TEMPERATURES HAVE 
NOT FALLEN MUCH THUS FAR. EXPECT THEM TO DROP AT LEAST A FEW DEGREES 
AS PRECIPITATION MOVES IN. CLOUDS SHOULD DECREASE AFTER FRONTAL 
PASSAGE AND EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO MAKE A SLIGHT RECOVERY ALTHOUGH 
DIURNAL RANGE SHOULD BE SMALL. IN THE END AFTERNOON HIGHS MAY NOT BE 
MORE THAN ONE OR TWO DEGREES WARMER THAN 2 AM READINGS.

DECIDED TO KEEP A SMALL CHANCE OF SHOWERS INTO THE EVENING FOR 
SOUTHEASTERN ZONES AS MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE FRONT WILL BE SLOW TO 
PUSH SOUTH OF THERE. HIGHER CLOUDS MAY START MOVING BACK IN FROM THE 
SOUTH LATE IN THE NIGHT AHEAD OF UPPER SYSTEM QUICKLY MOVING OUT OF 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS.

ETA AND GFS STILL SHOWING DIFFERENCES IN HANDLING THIS NEXT SYSTEM 
WITH THE LATTER KEEPING MORE AMPLITUDE. THIS HAS AN EFFECT ON HOW 
STRONG OF A SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS ALONG THE FRONT TO OUR SOUTH AND 
THUS HOW STRONG THE OVERRUNNING WILL BE. LOOKS LIKE SOME OF THE 
STRENGTH IN THE GFS MAY BE A RESULT OF FEEDBACK PROBLEMS SO HAVE 
FAVORED FLATTER SOLUTION IN THE ETA. WILL KEEP THE CHANCE OF RAIN IN 
THE SOUTHEASTERN ZONE ALTHOUGH LIMIT IT TO SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

WILL CONTINUE WITH FREEZE OUTLOOK ISSUED FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND LET 
THE DAY SHIFT REEVALUATE AS LONGER RANGE GUIDANCE IS LOOKING A

UPPER AIR PATTERN HAS A ZONAL FLOW OVER ILN CWA...WITH A TROF 
DIGGING INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES.  THOUGH MOST OF ENERGY WITH 
THE MAIN TROF WILL BE NORTH OF HERE OVER THE GREAT LAKES...SHORT 
WAVES MOVING UP THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PROVIDE LIFT STARTING LATE 
TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY.

FIRST SHORT WAVE WILL ARRIVE TONIGHT JUST AHEAD OF COLD FRONT 
CURRENTLY OVER IOWA.  THIS WILL ENHANCE PRECIP TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS.  WITH A STRONG H8 JET FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO TO THE OHIO 
VALLEY...GOOD MOISTURE FEED IS INDICATED ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE

SATURDAY.  I EXPECT THAT SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AROUND NOON

THE FRONT COMPLETELY THROUGH OUR AREA BY 06Z SUNDAY...A BIT FARTHER

ON SUNDAY...SHORT WAVE ALONG FRONT IS ALSO PROGGED TO BE FARTHER 
SOUTH THAN PREVIOUS RUNS HAD SHOWN.  ILL GO WITH 30 POPS IN 
PORTSMOUTH GROUP WHILE KEEPING REST OF FA PRECIP FREE. 

TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL RESULT IN BREEZY

APPROACHING CLIPPER-TYPE SYSTEM. 

MODELS IN GENERALLY GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING REGION IN WEST NORTHWEST

MOISTURE IS QUITE LOW RIGHT NOW WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 20S.  LOW

PRESENT WITH A COLD FRONT CROSSING THE AREA EARLY SATURDAY.

IR SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AM SHOWED MAINLY OVERCAST CONDITIONS ACRS 
THE REGION. THE STRATOCUMULUS...LOW AC AND CIRROSTRATUS WAS IN 
RESPONSE TO A S/WV LOCATED OVER SRN MISSOURI.  THIS S/WV WILL PIVOT 
EAST TODAY...BUT SHOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER.  ALTHOUGH 
THE PVA ASSOCIATED WITH THIS S/WV LOOKS TO BE FOCUSED TOWARD ERN 
KY/WEST VA...WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT COMBINED WITH A DEEPENING OF MSTR 
IN THE ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN SHOULD SQUEEZE OUT A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE 
CWFA THIS AFTN.  TEMPS WILL REMAIN COOL AS THICK CLOUD COVER WILL 
PREVENT SIGNIFICANT INSOLUTION.

FOR TONIGHT...SECONDARY S/WV IN NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT IS POISED 
TO MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES REGION.  THIS DISTURBANCE IS 
EXPECTED TO PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT FOR A CHC OF SHOWERS...WITH THE 
HIGHEST PROBABILITY BEING OVER THE NRN MIAMI VALLEY.  TEMPS 
OVERNIGHT WILL FALL INTO THE MID AND UPPER 30S.  THESE SFC TEMPS AND 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL REMAIN WARM (I.E. ABOVE THE 0 DEGREE 
ISOTHERM) THAT ALL PCPN WILL REMAIN IN THE FORM OF RAIN.

ON FRIDAY....SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY DURING THE MORNING

AHEAD OF ALBERTA CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEM BEGINS TO ERODE THE LOWER LVL 
CLOUDS.  WITH BACKING FLOW TO THE SOUTHWEST AND SUNSHINE...MODELS

ALBERTA TYPE CLIPPER SYSTEM MOVES RAPIDLY TOWARD OUR REGION FRIDAY 
NIGHT.  DECENT UPR LVL JET COMBINED WITH GOOD 925 MB TO 850 MB LOW 
LVL CONVERGENCE AND MSTR OUT OF THE GULF SHOULD DEVELOP A NICE BAND 
OF RAIN AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  AVN/ETA TIME PCPN IN AROUND MIDNIGHT 
FAR NORTHWEST AND LATE IN OUR E AND SE CWFA.  LIKELY POPS LOOK GOOD 
ATTM.

FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...RAIN SHOULD CONTINUE DURING THE

BEGINS TO SLOW UP ACRS THE FA.  AVN MODEL HAD BEEN SHOWING A 
DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE WAVE ACRS THE SRN PORTION OF FRONT IN 
RESPONSE TO A SRN STREAM S/WV PIVOTING OUT OF TEXAS TOWARD THE OHIO

AT 07Z...COLD FRONT WAS JUST PUSHING INTO THE FAR ERN SECTIONS OF 
THE CWFA.  ONCE THIS FRONT PUSHES EAST OF THE REGION...THE RAIN 
SHOULD END.  WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EARLY MORNING MENTION OF RAIN IN 
THE EAST (FROM ABOUT 430 AM TO 600 AM EDT).  OTHERWISE...A COOL 
NORTHERLY FLOW...COMBINED WITH 925 MB TO 850 MB MSTR SHOULD YIELD 
BROKEN TO OVERCAST STRATOCUMULUS TODAY.  THE STRATOCUMULUS MAY TAKE 
AWHILE TO FORM IN THE WEST THIS AM...BUT FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IT 
SHOULD BECOME BROKEN BY AFTN.  WILL GO WITH THE AVN MAV GUIDANCE FOR 
HIGHS TODAY DUE TO COOL FLOW AND EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

FOR TODAY...AN UPR LEVEL TROF BEGINS TO DEEPEN ACRS THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION AS A TANDEM OF S/WVS MOVES THROUGH THE MEAN H5 TROF.  THE 
FIRST S/WV HAS SHOWN A FARTHER SOUTHWARD TREND...BEING LOCATED JUST 
SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER ON THURSDAY.  WITH COLD CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT 
AND DEEP MOISTURE...THIS WILL CAUSE SKIES TO BE MOSTLY CLOUDY TO 
CLOUDY.  A 30 PERCENT CHC OF SHOWERS...MAINLY IN THE 
AFTERNOON...WILL BE EMPLOYED ACRS THE ENTIRE CWFA.  TEMPS WILL 
REMAIN COOL WITH OVERCAST CONDITIONS...IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S.

FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...AVN/ETA ARE SHOWING THE SECOND S/WV TRENDING 
FARTHER NORTH AND NOT AS FOCUSED (I.E. MORE SHEARED).  WITH THIS IN 
MIND...WILL TAILOR POPS FROM EXPECTED DYNAMICS OF S/WV FROM 50 NORTH 
TO 30 SOUTH.  BOTH ETA/AVN MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER WILL BE TOO WARM TO SUPPORT SNOW...SO AN ALL LIQUID EVENT IS 
EXPECTED.

SKIES WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY ON FRIDAY AS A MIXTURE OF 
STRATOCUMULUS/ALTOCUMULUS/CIRROSTRATUS IS FORECAST.  WILL GO COOLER 
THAN AVN MAV DUE TO EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

ALBERTA TYPE FRONTAL SYSTEM IS FASTER ON CURRENT FORECAST MODEL

AT 07Z...COLD FRONT WAS JUST PUSHING INTO THE FAR ERN SECTIONS OF 
THE CWFA.  ONCE THIS FRONT PUSHES EAST OF THE REGION...THE RAIN 
SHOULD END.  WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EARLY MORNING MENTION OF RAIN IN 
THE EAST (FROM ABOUT 430 AM TO 600 AM EDT).  OTHERWISE...A COOL 
NORTHERLY FLOW...COMBINED WITH 925 MB TO 850 MB MSTR SHOULD YIELD 
BROKEN TO OVERCAST STRATOCUMULUS TODAY.  THE STRATOCUMULUS MAY TAKE 
AWHILE TO FORM IN THE WEST THIS AM...BUT FEEL CONFIDENT THAT IT 
SHOULD BECOME BROKEN BY AFTN.  WILL GO WITH THE AVN MAV GUIDANCE FOR 
HIGHS TODAY DUE TO COOL FLOW AND EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

FOR TODAY...AN UPR LEVEL TROF BEGINS TO DEEPEN ACRS THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION AS A TANDEM OF S/WVS MOVES THROUGH THE MEAN H5 TROF.  THE 
FIRST S/WV HAS SHOWN A FARTHER SOUTHWARD TREND...BEING LOCATED JUST 
SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER ON THURSDAY.  WITH COLD CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT 
AND DEEP MOISTURE...THIS WILL CAUSE SKIES TO BE MOSTLY CLOUDY TO 
CLOUDY.  A 30 PERCENT CHC OF SHOWERS...MAINLY IN THE 
AFTERNOON...WILL BE EMPLOYED ACRS THE ENTIRE CWFA.  TEMPS WILL 
REMAIN COOL WITH OVERCAST CONDITIONS...IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S.

FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...AVN/ETA ARE SHOWING THE SECOND S/WV TRENDING 
FARTHER NORTH AND NOT AS FOCUSED (I.E. MORE SHEARED).  WITH THIS IN 
MIND...WILL TAILOR POPS FROM EXPECTED DYNAMICS OF S/WV FROM 50 NORTH 
TO 30 SOUTH.  BOTH ETA/AVN MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER WILL BE TOO WARM TO SUPPORT SNOW...SO AN ALL LIQUID EVENT IS 
EXPECTED.

SKIES WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY ON FRIDAY AS A MIXTURE OF 
STRATOCUMULUS/ALTOCUMULUS/CIRROSTRATUS IS FORECAST.  WILL GO COOLER 
THAN AVN MAV DUE TO EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

ALBERTA TYPE FRONTAL SYSTEM IS FASTER ON CURRENT FORECAST MODEL 
RUNS...SO WILL INTRODUCE SHOWERS INTO THE FORECAST FOR SATURDAY.

.ILN...NONE.

A COLD FRNT/WIND SHIFT LINE WAS POSITIONED ACROSS INDIANA FROM KDFI

THE MAV HAS BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH LOW TEMPS TONIGHT BEHIND THE 
COLD FNT.  CLOUDS AND LAGGING LOW LEVEL THICKNESS ADVECTION MAY KEEP 
TEMPS JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE MAV GUIDANCE...WHICH IS THE LOW TO MID 40S 
WEST TO EAST.  THE PCPN ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW TO THE SOUTH WILL 
AFFECT THE CMH AND PMH ZONES...WHERE CHANCE POPS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL 
EARLY WEDNESDAY. 

ON WEDNESDAY...TEMPS WILL REMAIN IN THE LOW 50S WITH CAA AND

AFTERNOON BUT THE GFS AND ETA HAS LINGERING 850 MB 90+ RH ACROSS 
FCST AREA.  IN ADDITION...SAT PR DEF PLAN VIEW SUGGESTS EAST SHOULD 
STAY AT LEAST MOSTLY CLOUDY.  BOTH THE GFS AND ETA HAVE ANOTHER S/WV 
WEDNESDAY EVENING THAT PUTS OUT VERY LIGHT QPF ON THE EDGE OF THE SE 
FCST AREA BUT WILL KEEP PMH DRY AT THIS POINT.  

ANOTHER S/WV PUSHES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...AND THE AVN HAS SOME

A CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN WEST FOR AFTERNOON.  THE SHOWERS WILL 
CONTINUE THURSDAY NIGHT...WHEN MUCH OF THE FCST AREA WILL BE IN THE 
MID TO UPPER 30S.  A GFS SNDG FOR 4 AM FRIDAY MORNING AT FFO APPLIED

SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AM WAS SHOWING AN INCREASE IN HIGH LVL CLOUDS 
ACRS THE CWFA.  THE THICKENING OF CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE 
DAY AS MOISTURE IS TRANSPORTED NORTHEAST FROM DEVELOPING LOW 
PRESSURE ALONG THE GULF COAST STATES.  THE SFC MAP AT 08Z DEPICTED 
LOW PRESSURE NEAR THE PANHANDLE OF FLORIDA.  MEANWHILE...A COLD 
FRONT WAS NOTED FROM CNTRL LAKE SUPERIOR...ERN WI...ERN IOWA...THEN 
INTO NRN OKLA.

A SQUEEZE PLAY WILL BE OCCURRING OVER THE CWFA OVER THE NEXT 24 
HOURS AS AFOREMENTIONED SFC LOW PRESSURE MOVES NE INTO THE MID 
ATLANTIC REGION ON WEDNESDAY WHILE THE COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST PASSES 
THROUGH OUR AREA LATE THIS AFTN INTO TONIGHT.  THE LOW WILL BRING 
COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF RAIN TO LOCATIONS SOUTH AND EAST OF THE CWFA AS 
STRONG WAA AND DYNAMICAL LIFT FROM DEVELOPING UPR JET OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES COMBINED FORCES.  FOR OUR REGION TODAY...GRADUAL 
WAA/ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL CAUSE CLOUDS TO THICKEN...WITH THE THICKEST 
CLOUDS BEING LOCATED OVER THE PMH AREA.  AS A RESULT...TEMPS SHOULD 
BE WARMEST FAR NW AND COOLEST SOUTHEAST.

FOR TONIGHT...AS COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE REGION AND DEEPER 
MOISTURE MOVES UP EAST OF IT...A CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE...MAINLY IN THE CMH AND PMH GROUPS.  AS MENTIONED 
EARLIER...THE SIGNIFICANT WIDESPREAD RAIN SHOULD STAY SOUTH AND EAST 
OF THE REGION.  WITH LOW LVL CAA DEVELOPING LATE...TEMPS WILL BE 
SOMEWHAT TRICKY.  WILL GO SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN GUIDANCE OVERNIGHT 
DUE TO EXPECTED OVERCAST CONDITIONS.

ON WEDNESDAY...CLOUDS WILL SLOWLY DECREASE FROM WEST TO EAST AS THE 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES TOWARD THE NEW JERSEY COAST BY EVENING.  
SKIES SHOULD BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY WEST WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS REMAINING IN THE EAST.

S/WV ENERGY MOVING OUT OF SRN CANADA WILL CAUSE AN UPR LVL TROF TO 
DEEPEN OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION THROUGH FRIDAY.  CLOUDS WILL 
INCREASE ON THURSDAY WITH A CHC OF SHOWERS EXPECTED THURSDAY NIGHT 
WITH A SECOND...MORE VIGOROUS S/WV.  TEMPS AT 850 MB THURSDAY NIGHT 
APPROACH -8 TO -9 DEGREES C.  AS A RESULT...THE NATURE OF THE

TIME OF THE YEAR (MID OCTOBER)...THE BOUNDARY LAYER USUALLY WILL 
STAY ABOVE THE 0 DEGREE ISOTHERM THROUGH AT LEAST THE LOWEST 1000

BIG QUESTION TONIGHT IS JUST HOW HIGH THE WINDS WILL STAY UP. EITHER

TO MAV TEMPS...GOING SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN CRNT FCST. 

AM PREFERRING THE MORE CONSISTENT AND BETTER INITIALIZED AVN FOR 
GENERAL SFC PATTERN AND ESPECIALLY LOW TEMPS. LOOKS LIKE FOR 
MON...WL GO WTH SUNNY SKIES...EXCEPT MO SUNNY IN THE SOUTH WITH 
INCREASING MID LEVEL CLOUDS DURING THE AFTN. OVERNIGHT LOWS TO 
REBOUND GRADUALLY INTO THE MID WEEK.

AM OPTING TO KEEP TUE NIGHT DRY ATTM...AS IT LOOKS LIKE DEEPEST MSTR 
FROM LOW TRAVELLING UP APPALACIANS WILL GENERALLY BE E OF FA. NEXT

MOST OF THE FCST IS RUNNIN ON WITH THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE. LOOKS LIKE 
THERES A COLD POOL NW OF FCST AREA WHERE TEMPS OVER THE FAR NORTH 
ARE A LITTLE COOLER THAN EXPECTED. WILL OPEN UP A RANGE IN LOWS  
INSTEAD OF KEEPING THEM IN THE LOWER 50S. LOOKS LIKE 47 TO 52 WILL 
WORK OUT BEST HERE. 

THERES A DEFINITE NORTHERLY EDGE TO THIS PRECIP SHIELD AND THIS

ONLY CHANGES WITH REGARDS TO PRECIP WILL BE TO REMOVE TIMING WORDING 
OVER THE NORTH. MORE RAIN COMING INTO SRN FCST AREA WHICH SHOULD

ASIDE FROM COSMETIC CHANGES, NO UPDATE NECESSARY. TEMPS ACROSS

DRIER COOLER AUTUMN PATTERN HAS FINALLY MOVED INTO THE REGION. 
STRATOCUMULUS HAS ALREADY CLEARED THE AREA TO THE EAST. COULD SEE A 
FEW HIGH CLOUDS STREAK IN FROM THE WEST LATE TONIGHT BUT FOR THE 
MOST PART IT WILL BE CLEAR. HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY MOVE TO THE 
EAST OVERNIGHT WITH THE NEXT COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE WEST 
LATE SUNDAY. SHOULD BE MAINLY HIGH AND MID CLOUDS INCREASING THROUGH 
THE DAY. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED WITH THE FRONT BUT STILL 
APPEARS TO BE SUFFICIENT DYNAMICS TO WARRANT KEEPING A LOW CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. COULD SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF STRATOCUMULUS 
AGAIN ON MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.

MAV TEMPERATURES LOOKED PRETTY GOOD FOR LOWS. BUT IT SEEMS THAT GFS 
KEEPS LOW LEVELS TOO COOL ON SUNDAY SO HAVE GONE A FEW DEGREES 
WARMER TOMORROW. ALSO IT APPEARS THAT THE GFS IS UNDERDOING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF LOW CLOUDS HANGING ON FOR MONDAY SO WENT A COUPLE OF 
DEGREES COOLER THEN.

WITH LIMITED MOISTURE AVAILABILITY THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK WILL

EARLIER THAN FORECAST. WILL KEEP 100 POP FOR THIS AFTERNOON BUT WITH 
UNCERTAINTY MAY TRIM BACK POPS IN THE WESTERN ZONES FOR THIS

CURRENT FORECAST COVERS IT WELL WITH WINDS INCREASING TO 20 TO 30

EXPECT WINDY CONDITIONS TOMORROW AND WILL MENTION GUSTS TO 35 MPH. 
THIS WILL KEEP TEMPS FAIRLY UNIFORM...AND WILL TREND TOWARDS THE MAV

MUCH EXCEPT LOWS ON SAT PM ARE TOO COOL AND ADJUSTED UPWARDS.

WITH MOST OF THE MODELS TRANSLATING A LOT OF THE ENERGY COMING FROM 
THE MIDWEST TOWARDS THE NORTHERN GTLKS...QPF SHOULD BE FAIRLY 
REASONABLE AROUND 1-2 INCHES AND SHOULDNT BRING MORE THAN A FEW 
FLOODING PROBLEMS TOMORROW NIGHT. DO NOT EXPECT TO HAVE ANY KIND OF 
FLOOD WATCH OUT, THOUGH DAMAGING WINDS ARE POSSIBLE AS LLJET STREAMS 
MOISTURE NORTH THROUGH FCST AREA. ADVY CONDITIONS FOR WIND WILL 
MARGINAL TOMORROW...BUT THIS WOULDNT BE ISSUED UNTIL MID SHIFT EVEN 
IF IT WERE EXPECTED ACROSS THE FCST AREA. 

ON THE EXTENDED, EXPECT TO BE A LITTLE COOLER ON TEMPS (WHICH WILL 
PLACE US AROUND NORMAL). RELATIVELY DRY FCST WITH EXCEPTION OF S/W 
MOVING THROUGH ON SUN NIGHT. ANOTHER ONE IS PROGGED TO PASS N OF 
FCST AREA OVERNIGHT TUES AND WILL INCLUDE LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE N

STRATUS DECK IS SLOWLY LIFTING AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO BREAK OUT 
LATER THIS AFTERNOON...BUT CLOUD COVER LOOKS TO BE MOSTLY CLOUDY. 
THIS WILL CUT HIGHS A BIT...BUT THEY SHOULD STILL REACH AROUND 80 OR 
THE LOWER 80S WHICH IS IN THE REALM OF CURRENT FCST. WILL LIKELY CUT 
THE UPPER END BY A FEW DEGREES AND RANGE TEMPS FROM 78 TO 83 ACROSS 
THE BOARD SINCE WERE A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW TEMPS FROM THIS TIME 
YESTERDAY. 

H8 WINDS MAY BE AROUND 20 KTS...BUT WONT REACH THE SFC. WILL CUT 
BACK WINDS ACROSS THE BOARD TO GO WITH A GENERIC 5-10 VS THE 10-20

FRNTL BNDRY ELONGATED W-E ACRS GRT LKS THIS MRNG WITH A WEAKENING 
TSTM CLUSTER OVER WESTERN IL AND SOUTHERN WI.  AC/CI DEBRIS ACRS 
NORTHERN HALF OF FCST AREA WITH DVLPG SC ALONG OH RIVER SW OF CVG.

SC POSES INITIAL CHALLENGE TO THIS MRNG FCST AND HAS RAMIFICATIONS 
ON AFTN TEMPS ACRS FCST AREA.  SIMILAR SCENARIO PLAYED OUT ON 
TUESDAY...WITH SC NOT MIXING OUT UNTIL ERLY AFTN SOUTH OF I-70.  
MODEL SOUNDING DEPICT SIMILARITIES TO TUES MRNG WITH SOME 
CONVERGENCE BTWN 925 AND 850 MB.  APPEARS SOUNDINGS A LITTLE DRIER 
THIS AFTN OPPOSED TO TUES AFTN...BUT STILL EXPECT REASONABLE AMTS OF 
CU.  HOW LONG THE SC HOLDS ON AND HOW EXPANSIVE IT BECOMES WILL 
LIKELY DETERMINE WHETHER LOCATIONS RISE INTO THE L80S OR M80S.  HAVE 
OPENED TEMP RANGES TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS.

ETA/GFS RELATIVELY SIMILAR THROUGH THURS AS FRNTL BNDRY MAKES SLOW 
PUSH SOUTH INTO REGION TONIGHT.  NOT A WHOLE LOT OF LO LVL 
CONVERGENCE OR UVV OVERNIGHT...AND WILL NOT CHANGE 30 POPS CURRENTLY 
GOING ACRS NORTHERN ZONES.  UPR RIDGE HOLDS STRONG ACRS SE CONUS AND 
SHOULD KEEP CHC PCPN OUT OF SOUTHERN ZONES UNTIL THURS.  FRNT LAYS 
OUT ACRS CNTRL OH THURS BEFORE LIFTING NORTH AS WRM FRNT LATE 
THURS.  WILL CONTINUE 30 POPS EVERYWHERE THURS AND HIT CLDS A LITTLE 
HARDER ACRS NORTHERN ZONES.

DIFFERENCES BEGIN TO ABOUND IN MODELS THURS NIGHT.  00Z GFS NOW 
FASTER IN EJECTION AND MOVEMENT OF UPR TROF ACRS PLAINS THURS 
AFTN/NIGHT AND SUBSEQUENTLY FASTER WITH SPEED OF STRONG SFC LO.  
ALSO FURTHER NORTH AND WEST WITH TRACK OF SYSTEM THAN ETA...MOVING 
IT INTO UPR GRT LKS AFT 12Z FRI.  BOTH MODELS DEEPER WITH SFC LO AS 
IT TRACKS ACRS GRT LKS FRI WITH STRONG UPR JET 120+ KTS TRACKING NW 
OF REGION AND 40+ KNOT LO LVL JET FORMING BY FRI EVNG.  PULLING POPS 
THURS NIGHT AS IT LOOKS LIKE A GOOD CHANCE TO BE DRY IN WARM SECTOR 
AS WRM FRNT LIFTS INTO GRT LKS. 

AS THIS SYSTEM APPCHGS REGION...LILI TRACKS NORTH OUT OF GULF 
REGION.  GFS/UKMET/CANADIAN CONSISTENT AND PREFERRED WITH LA/SE TX 
LANDFALL THURS EVNG...WITH ETA/ECMWF ERRATIC IN MOVEMENT OF SYSTEM 
FRI/SAT.  GFS TRACKING SYSTEM FASTER NORTH AND EAST ACRS TN AND OH 
VALLEYS FRI NIGHT/ERLY SAT.  GFS WAS SIMILAR IN HANDLING OF ISIDORE 
LAST WEEK...AND FASTER SOLN PANNED OUT.  BOTH GFS/ETA ADVERTISING 
DRY WX FOR MUCH OF FRI AS UPR RIDGE HOLDS STRONG.  COULD BE RATHER 
WARM DAY DEPENDING ON CLD COVER.  FOCUS FOR HEAVIEST PCPN APPEARS TO 
BE FRI LATE AFTN/NIGHT AS TROPICAL MOISTURE AND FRNTL BNDRY AFFECT 
FCST AREA.  

EXTENDED...COULD BE DRIER ON SAT IF FASTER GFS SOLN TAKES PLACE BUT 
WILL LEAVE CURRENT FCST AS IS.  DRIER AND COOLER WEATHER FOR 
REMAINDER OF EXTND AND WILL NOT CHANGE.

TEMPS...SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN MAV TODAY AS TEMPS DEPENDENT ON CLD 
COVER.  WENT A LITTLE ABOVE MAV AT DAY/CMH ON THURS.  NEAR MAV ON

CONUS.  AC TRACKING ACRS REGION SHOULD BE EAST OF FCST AREA BY 
SUNRISE.  WEAK FRNTL BNDRY ORIENTED NE-SW FROM UPR GRT LKS INTO 
CNTRL PLAINS.

GFS/ETA IN DECENT AGREEMENT SHORT TERM AS SFC HI PRES AND STRONG UPR 
RIDGE ANCHORED OVER SE STATES WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP OH VALLEY IN A 
DRY WX PATTERN OVER THE NEXT 36 HRS WITH ABOVE NORM TEMPS.  NO 
THREAT FOR PCPN AS WEAK MID LVL CAP IN PLACE THROUGH WED.  FRNTL 
BNDRY WILL TRACK TOWARDS REGION...BUT WILL NOT BE A FACTOR UNTIL WED 
NIGHT.  LG AREA OF CI/AC ACRS MO/IL/WESTERN IN WILL DRIFT ACRS FCST 
AREA TODAY AND SHOULD FILTER SUNSHINE A LITTLE MORE THAN MONDAY.  CU 
RULE AND MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO SUPPORT CU DVLPMNT THIS 
AFTN...ESPECIALLY ACRS THE SOUTHERN ZONES.  LO LVL THICKNESSES AND 
850 TEMPS SLIGHTLY WARMER TODAY...BUT WITH MORE CLDS EXPECT SIMILAR 
TEMPS TO MONDAY.  AC/CI AHEAD OF FRNTL BNDRY TONIGHT WILL MAKE FOR 
PTLY CLDY CONDITIONS ACRS ENTIRE FCST AREA.

WED LOOKS TO BE WARMEST DAY AS THICKNESSES AND 850 TEMPS RISE EVEN 
HIGHER AND LESS CLDS EXPECTED.  POTENTIAL FOR MSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS 
ACRS CVG/PMH ZONES BUT INTEND TO KEEP PTLY CLDY CONDITION 
EVERYWHERE.  GFS SLOWER WITH FRNTL BNDRY...KEEPING IT NORTH OF 
REGION UNTIL WED NIGHT WHILE ETA PUSHES IT INTO FCST AREA LATE IN 
DAY.  FEEL GFS HAS BETTER HANDLE ON FRNT AND WILL TREND TOWARDS IT.  
WILL DROP AFTN POPS WED ACRS NW FCST AREA WITH SLOWER SOLN. BNDRY 
HAS TOUGH TIME DROPPING AGAINST UPR RIDGE WED NIGHT AND APPEARS TO 
NOT GET ANY FURTHER SOUTH THAN I-70 BY THURS MORN.

BNDRY BEGINS NORTHWARD TREK AS WRM FRNT THURS AS DEEP UPR TROF MOVES 
OUT OF THE 4 CORNERS REGION.  IN MOIST HUMID AIR (PWATS 1.5 IN) AND 
WITH CAPES APPCHG 1000-1500 J/KG...WILL CONTINUE 30 POPS ACRS ENTIRE 
FCST AREA.  MORE CLDS WILL KEEP TEMPS DOWN A FEW DEGREES FROM WED 
HIGHS.

FCST BEYOND THURS BECOMES HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON TWO MAJOR WX 
FEATURES...THE MOVEMENT OF THE UPR TROF AND DVLPG SFC LO ACRS CNTRL 
PLAINS AND TRACK OF HURRICANE LILI.  00Z GFS DRAMATICALLY DIFFERENT 
THAN 12Z RUN...REVERTING BACK TO MONDAYS 00Z RUN BY HAVING A THURS 
MRNG LANDFALL IN LOUISIANA.  REASON FOR THIS APPEARS TO BE A 
WEAKENING TREND ON THE WESTERN END OF THE UPR RIDGE LATE WED INTO 
THURS ALLOWING FOR LILI TO TURN MORE TO THE NORTH.  MOVEMENT OF LILI 
WITH APPCHG SFC LO AND UPR TROF ON FRI COULD MAKE FOR A RATHER NASTY 
DAY ACRS THE OH VALLEY.  FASTER SOLN WOULD ALSO LEAD TO DRIER WX ON 
SATURDAY.  AM NOT GOING TO MAKE ANY CHANGES TO FRI OR SAT SIMPLY 
BECAUSE STILL UNCERTAIN ON MODEL SOLNS.  IF MODELS CONTINUE TO TREND 
TOWARDS THURS LANDFALL...BEST CHC PCPN WOULD BE THURS NIGHT THRU FRI 
NIGHT/ERLY SAT.

SHORT TERM DOESNT POSE TOO MANY PROBLEMS AND GUIDANCE IS CLOSE ON 
ALL PERIODS. GENERALLY LOOKING FOR LOWS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S WITH 
HIGHS REACHING THE LOWER 80S THROUGH 48 HOURS. 

SFC FNT N OF FCST AREA EXPECTED TO DRAPE AN INVERTED TROF HERE WED 
PM INTO THURS. ETA IS GIVING A MORE SLY SOLUTION WITH THE TROF 
DROPPING S THRU THE MIDATLANTIC STATES DURING THIS TIME FRAME. 
PREFER THE GFS SOLUTION WHICH HAS A MORE REASONABLE PLACEMENT OF THE 
TROPICAL SYSTEM OVER THE GULF, BUT EXPECT TO HAVE CHANCE POPS IN WED 
PM FOR ALL BUT THE SRN HALF. MOISTURE SURGES IN ON THURSDAY AND 
CHANCE POPS EXPECTED IN ALL ZONES AS INVERTED TROF LIFTS N AS A 
WMFNT.

NEXT TROPICAL SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO AFFECT CWA LATER THIS WEEK...BUT 
CONFIDENCE IN ITS TIMING IS LOW. MODELS WERE IN FAIR AGREEMENT - ESP 
CAN/GFS WITH PLACEMENT AND STRENGTH OF BOTH SFC AND H5 MASS FIELDS. 
UKMET AND ECMWF ARE ALSO CLOSE IN MAJOR FEATURES OF SFC AND H5 LOWS. 
FROM THE PREVIOUS RUN, I EXPECTED TROPICAL MOISTURE TO GET WRUNG OUT 
OVER W-E INVERTED TROF BISECTING CWA BEGINNING THURSDAY NIGHT. NEW 
GFS RUN REALLY LIFTS THIS TROF AS A WMFNT IN THE GTLKS REGION 
OVERNIGHT THURS. INSTEAD OF MERGING THE WRN SFC LOW AND THE TROPICAL 
LOW IN THE MIDWEST ON FRIDAY, NEW RUN HAS THE WRN LOW TRACKING N OF 
FCST AREA AND HOLDING BACK THE TROPICAL SYSTEM. 

EXPECT TO HAVE CHANCE POPS IN ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH 
SHOWERS/ISOLATED THUNDER BEING THE PREDOMINANT WX FEATURE. TROPICAL 
SURGE FROM GFS ISNT GOING TO MAKE IT TO FCST AREA UNTIL THE

WHILE HIGHER DEWPOINT AIRMASS DOWN ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN US WILL 
SLOWLY ADVECT NORTHWARD MON INTO TUE. LOOKS LIKE BETTER MOISTURE 
HOLDS OFF UNTIL AFTER PASSAGE OF SHORT WAVE ON MON WITH ONLY FORCING 
BEING SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT THAT DEVELOPS ACROSS THE SOUTH AND 
SOUTHEAST PART OF FA LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO MONDAY NIGHT. THIS 
MAY BE ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE OUT A SPRINKLE OR LIGHT SHOWER BUT THINK IT 
WILL BE LIMITED ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN DRY FORECAST. WITH HIGHER 
DEWPOINTS ACROSS REGION ON TUESDAY...AIRMASS DOES DESTABILIZE SOME 
WITH SURFACE BASED CAPES APPROACHING 1500 J/KG. HOWEVER...LITTLE OR 
NO FORCING PRESENT SO WILL AGAIN KEEP FORECAST DRY.

SOME MODEL DIFFERENCES WITH LOW LEVEL THERMAL FIELDS NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS WITH NGM COOLEST AND ETA WARMEST. WITH LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMING 
MORE SOUTHERLY...THINK NGM TOO COOL AND WILL GO CLOSE TO AVN/GFS 
TEMPS FOR COMPROMISE...WHICH IS ALSO CLOSE TO CURRENT FORECAST OF 
LOW 80S ON MON AND MID 80S TUESDAY. 

WITH STRONG RIDE TO OUR SOUTHEAST...FRONT MAY BE A LITTLE SLOW 
DROPPING DOWN TOWARD FA AND WILL PUSH PCPN FOR WED BACK A LITTLE 
INTO THE AFTERNOON. WL THEN KEEP CHANCE OF PCPN THRU FRI AS AVN/GFS 
STILL SAGGING FRONTAL BOUNDARY DOWN ACROSS REGION MID TO LATE WEEK 
WITH STRONG MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVING OUT OF THE PLAINS. 00Z 
AVN/GFS STILL BRINGING REMNANTS FROM LILI UP INTO LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY THURSDAY AND THEN LIFTING IT QUICKLY UP THROUGH OHIO VALLEY 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...ALTHOUGH 12Z AVN/GFS PERHAPS A BIT FURTHER
WEST THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. LATEST UKMET LOOKS TO BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO 
AVN/GFS WHILE 12Z ETA THROUGH 84 HOURS LOOKS TO BE MORE SIMILAR TO 
ECMWF...KEEPING RIDGE STRONGER ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST AND HOLDING LILI 
FURTHER S AND W. WITH UNCERTAINTY...WILL KEEP SATURDAY DRY FOR NOW 
BUT IF LILI REMNANTS DUE END UP COMING UP THIS WAY...BEST CHC FOR 
PCPN WOULD PROBABLY BE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...POSSIBLY LINGERING 
INTO SATURDAY.

QUASI-ZONAL FLOW FORECAST TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM WITH A

WILL BE NEAR THE I-71 CORRIDOR WITH A SLIGHT DEVIATION TO EITHER

AM STILL SLIGHTLY CONCERNED THAT ETA (WITH NGM SUPPORTING IT) IS 
STILL SO MUCH FURTHER SOUTH WITH REMNANTS OF ISIDORE. HOWEVER, GFS 
IS SUPPORTED BY THE REMAINDER OF THE MODELS. ETA APPEARS TO BE 
METEOROLOGICALLY UNSOUND WITH RESOLVING H5 VORTS AND S/WS IN THE 
24-48 HR TIME FRAME. IT HANGS THEM BACK IN THE ARKLATX REGION BUT 
THERES NO REAL RIDGE TO STOP THEM FROM MERGING WITH TROPICAL 
INFLUENCE AND GIVING IT A KICK INTO THE WESTERLIES. 

AS FAR AS THE CURRENT FCST GOES, IM NOT GETTING TOO FANCY AND 
CHANGING MUCH. LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS WITH HEAVY WORDING 
EXPECTED ACROSS FCST AREAS OVERNIGHT TONIGHT INTO THE DAYTIME HOURS 
ON FRIDAY. EXPECT SOME EMBEDDED THUNDER, AND HAVE ADDED IT IN THE 
SOUTHEAST HALF OF FCST AREA TONIGHT...REST OF FCST AREA FOR FRIDAY. 

HAVE INCREASED CLOUDS OVER THE NE 1/3 OF FCST AREA ON SATURDAY WITH 
COLD POOL AND RESIDUAL MOISTURE. FOR TEMPS...EXPECT HIGHS TODAY TO 
MIRROR YESTERDAYS. CLOUD COVER WILL BE MORE...BUT WERE ALSO 
STARTING ABOUT +10 FROM YESTERDAYS TEMPS. WILL KEEP A MINIMAL 
DIURNAL RANGE OF ABOUT 5-6 DEGREES THROUGH TONIGHT...AND COOL THINGS 
DOWN TOMORROW AFTERNOON WITH ENTRANCE OF CAA ON BACK SIDE OF SFC 
LOW. 

WILL ISSUE FLOOD WATCH THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING STARTING THIS EVENING. 
DONT REALLY THINK THAT FAR NWRN FCST AREA WILL REALLY GET INTO THE 
THICK OF IT WITH FLOODING, BUT QPF FIELDS FROM GFS TELL ME THAT I 
CANT LEAVE THEM OUT.

MAIN FOCUS FOR FORECAST CONTINUES TO BE TROPICAL MOISTURE STREAMING 
NORTHWARD OUT OF THE GULF AHEAD OF ISIDORE. MODELS ARE CONSISTENT IN 
SHOWING THE DIFFERENCES IN THEIR SOLUTIONS WITH THE ETA BEING MUCH 
SLOWER AND KEEPING THE LOW SOUTH AND EAST WHILE THE GFS IS FASTER 
AND UP INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. LATEST AVAILABLE HURRICANE CENTER 
FORECAST IS SIMILAR TO WHAT THE GFS ENDED UP WITH. AND THERE IS A 
CLUSTER OF MODEL SOLUTIONS INCLUDING THE CANADIAN AND UKMET MODELS 
THAT ARE SIMILAR TO THE GFS ALTHOUGH THE GFS IS ON THE NORTHWEST 
EDGE OF THE ENVELOPE.

NO MATTER WHICH SOLUTION...APPEARS THAT THERE WILL BE HEAVY RAINFALL 
ACROSS PART IF NOT ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE EXACT TRACK WILL 
DETERMINE THE TIMING OF THE RAIN AND HOW MUCH OF THE AREA IS 
IMPACTED BY THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL. WILL HEAVILY LEAN TOWARDS THE 
CLUSTERED SOLUTIONS OFFERED BY THE VARIOUS SPECTRAL MODELS. 

LOOKS LIKE OVERRUNNING PRECIPITATION COULD SPREAD INTO SOUTHERN 
ZONES AS SOON AS LATE TONIGHT WHICH WILL THEN SPREAD NORTH NORTHWEST 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY. BY THURSDAY NIGHT 
COPIOUS MOISTURE WILL BE IN PLACE AND EXPECT HEAVIEST RAINFALL TO 
OCCUR FROM THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING AS REMNANTS OF ISIDORE 
APPROACH. LATEST INDICATIONS ARE STILL POINTING TOWARDS MAXIMUM 
RAINFALL IN THE AREA FROM I-71 SOUTH AND EASTWARD. BELIEVE THAT 
PRECIPITATION WILL END QUICKLY DURING THE DAY FRIDAY AS THE LOW 
MOVES TO THE EAST OF THE REGION. DO NOT SEE MUCH REASON TO VARY MUCH 
FROM MAV TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE ALTHOUGH DIURNAL RANGE FOR THURSDAY 
AND THURSDAY NIGHT COULD EVEN BE SMALLER.

EXPECT WEATHER TO BE MUCH QUIETER BEYOND FRIDAY. A COUPLE OF SHORT 
WAVES WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION OVER THE WEEKEND. BUT 
BELIEVE THAT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED IN THE WAKE OF THE REMNANTS OF 
ISIDORE. LOOKS LIKE A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY AND ALTHOUGH MOISTURE COULD STILL BE LIMITED AT THAT TIME 
WILL ADD IN A LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS.

NO BIG CHANGES TO FCST THIS MORNING. TEMPS LOOK GOOD, BUT IF ETA

HOWEVER, MODELLERS SUGGEST THE GFS SOLUTION WITH REGARDS TO TROPICAL 
SYSTEM MOVING NORTH TOWARDS ERN OHVLY. THANKS TO KRLX AND KSDF FOR 
COORDINATION. 

AM A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT THE H5 WESTERLY FLOW WILL KEEP A MAJORITY 
OF THIS PRECIP TO THE EAST, BUT IN THESE SITUATIONS WITH THE 
REMNANTS OF A TROPICAL SYSTEM IM INCLINED TO STICK WITH A CONSENSUS 
FCST WHICH ISNT FAR FROM CURRENT FCST. HAVE BUMPED POPS A LITTLE 
THURS IN THE SOUTH AND ACROSS THE BOARD THURS PM. AM SEEING A BIT OF 
A DIFFERENCE IN POPS TO THE N AND NW OF FCST AREA, BUT NOT BY TOO 
MUCH. THIS IS STILL OKAY AS WRN AND NRN EDGE OF GOOD PRECIP WILL

QUIET WEATHER OVER NEXT 36 HOURS...RAIN FROM ISIDORE COULD AFFECT 
FCST AREA FOR THURS/FRI.

THROUGH WED NIGHT...BEAUTIFUL AFTN ACRS REGION AS HI PRES CENTERED 
OVER NW ILLINOIS DOMINATES.  CI ASSOCD WITH ISIDORE ALREADY INTO TN 
AND SOUTHERN KY ATTM...AND EXPECT THESE CLDS TO WORK INTO SOUTHERN 
FCST AREA TONIGHT.  ETA/AVN IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN MOVING HI PRES ACRS 
LOWER GRT LKS OVERNIGHT AS CI MOVES NORTH INTO REGION.  MY INITIAL 
FEELING IS TO GO PTLY CLDY ACRS SOUTHERN ZONES TONIGHT WITH MSTLY 
CLR SKIES ACRS THE NORTH.  EXPECT CI WILL MAKE IT INTO CMH/DAY ZONES 
BUT NOT THICK ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY PTLY CLDY WORDING.  TEMPS WILL 
LIKELY BE WARMER TONIGHT WITH HIGHER 850 TEMPS AND MORE 
CLDS...ESPECIALLY ACRS THE SOUTH.  HOWEVER...COOL SPOTS SOUTH AND 
EAST OF CMH AND ACRS WEST CNTRL OH COULD STILL DROP INTO M40S WITH 
HI PRES NEARBY AND LIGHT WINDS EXPECTED.  WILL OPEN UP RANGES MOST 
AREAS.

CI WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM NORTH ON WED WITH LOWER/MID CLDS LIKELY 
HOLDING OFF UNTIL LATE IN THE DAY ACRS THE SOUTH.  AVN/ETA BEGIN TO 
DIFFER IN AMT AND AREAL COVERAGE OF CI...SO WILL TRY TO BLEND 
SOLNS.  PTLY CLDY ACRS NORTH LOOKS GOOD...WITH PTLY SUNNY WORDING 
ACRS SOUTH.  STILL FEEL THERE IS GOOD POTENTIAL FOR AFTN TEMPS IN 
THE M70S BASED ON TODAYS READINGS AND QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW THICK CI 
WILL ACTUALLY BE.  AS CLDS THICKEN AND TROPICAL PLUME OF MOISTURE 
INCREASES WED NIGHT...WILL INTRODUCE MSTLY CLDY WORDING ACRS SOUTH 
AND LATE IN CMH/DAY ZONES.

THURS/FRI...MODELS CONVERGING ON LANDFALL OF ISIDORE SOMETIME THURS 
ON LOUISIANA COAST WEST OF NEW ORLEANS.  12Z AVN ABOUT 12 HRS FASTER 
WITH LANDFALL THAN 00Z RUN...BRINGING IT IN BTWN 06Z-12Z.  
ETA/UKMET/ECMWF ALL LATER IN AFTN THURS WITH LANDFALL.  AVN THEN 
RACES ISIDORE N-NE PLACING IT IN CNTRL KY BY 12Z FRI.  ALTHOUGH THE 
AVN HAS SHOWN THE BEST RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY OVER THE LAST 
THREE/FOUR RUNS...AM NOT SOLD ON THE FASTER SOLN.  12Z AVN A GOOD 
300 MILES NORTH AND EAST OF NHC LOCATION ON FRI MORN.  ETA ON THE 
OTHER HAND WOBBLES ISIDORE OFF THE GULF COAST INTO FRI AFTN.  WILL 
TREND TOWARDS AVN SOLN...BUT WITH A SLOWER FWD SPEED.  WEAKENING CLD 
FRNT MOVING DOWN FROM UPPER MIDWEST PROGGED TO BE JUST WEST OF FCST 
AREA BY ERLY FRI WITH UPR LVL TROF JUST BEHIND IT.  SPEED OF UPR 
TROF WILL LARGELY DETERMINE ULTIMATELY WHERE ISIDORE GOES AND HOW 
FAST IT MOVES.

THE END RESULT FROM ALL OF THIS IS THAT THE FCST AREA IS GOING TO 
SEE RAIN...THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH?  PWATS CLIMB ABOVE 1.5 IN ACRS 
THE SOUTH BY MIDDAY THURS WITH 2 IN+ ALONG AND SOUTH OF I-71 BY ERLY 
FRI.  WILL INTRODUCE PCPN THURS AFTN ACRS SOUTH AND INTO ENTIRE FCST 
AREA THURS NIGHT.  SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY ACRS PMH AREA THURS 
NIGHT COULD LEAD TO A FEW TSTMS.  WITH UNCERTAINITY ON SPEED OF 
ISIDORE...AM NOT GOING TO MENTION ANY TIMING FOR PCPN ON FRI.  
LIKELY POPS SEEM REASONABLE ALL AREAS THURS NIGHT/FRI.  WITH HI 
PWATS CERTAINLY SOME FLOODING POTENTIAL AND WILL SEND OUT ESF TO 
HIGHLIGHT.

TEMPS...MAV APPEARS TOO COOL...MET MUCH TOO WARM AND FWC DOWN THE 
MIDDLE.  WILL TAKE BLEND OF MAV/FWC NUMBERS THROUGH THURS.

EXTENDED...DRIER AND COOLER WEATHER FROM SAT ON AS UPR TROF MOVES 
ACRS AREA AND ISIDORE PULLS AWAY.  AVN DVLPG UPR LO OVER TN VALLEY 
MON AND DRIFTING IT NE INTO OH VALLEY TUES.  NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCED

ANOTHER CHILLY NIGHT WITH CLR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS.  EXPECT GOOD 
TEMP SPREADS BTWN CITIES AND RURAL AREAS.  DEWPTS IN L40S OVERNIGHT

INDICATE MAINLY THIS EVENING. 

FA WILL REMAIN IN THE WARM SECTOR THROUGH FRIDAY WITH CONTINUED 
SOUTHERLY FLOW AND WAA. MOISTURE SOMEWHAT LIMITED ON THURSDAY BUT 
ALL THREE MODELS HINTING AT A WEAK S/W MOVING THROUGH. THERE ALSO 
APPEARS TO BE SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT THROUGH THE DAY AND WITH 
AIRMASS REMAINING SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE...WILL HANG ON TO A LOW CHC POP 
FOR THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT.

ETA HAS TRENDED EVEN SLOWER WITH APPROACH OF UPPER LEVEL TROF...NOW 
HOLDING BACK MAIN BATCH OF PCPN TIL FRI NIGHT. AVN A LITTLE 
QUICKER...BRINGING BETTER SHOT OF PCPN INTO THE WEST THROUGH LATE 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON. GIVEN SLOWER TREND OF PAST SEVERAL MODEL 
RUNS...WILL GO AHEAD AND SPREAD BETTER CHC OF PCPN IN FROM WEST TO 
EAST FOR LATE FRIDAY BUT HIT POPS THE HARDEST FOR FRI NIGHT. WL ALSO 
HANG ON TO A LINGERING CHANCE FOR SATURDAY.

WL BUMP UP HIGH TEMPS A LITTLE FROM CURRENT FORECAST FOR NEXT COUPLE 
OF DAYS WITH CONTINUED WAA AND FRONT A LITTLE SLOWER ON FRIDAY/ 
FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL ALSO NUDGE UP LOWS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AS IT LOOKS 
LIKE WINDS MAY STAY UP A LITTLE.

NEXT UPPER SYSTEM COMING IN FOR LATER TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY SEEMS

GET PULLED NORTHWEST TOWARDS THE CENTER OF THE H5 LOW WEST OF THE 
GTLKS, AND SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE CAROLINAS AS IT UNDERCUTS THE H5 
RIDGE THATS SLOWLY BEING PUSHED TOWARDS THE MID ATLANTIC. 

WILL NOT PLAY UP SHOWERS ON WEDNESDAY AS THE UPPER SUPPORT IS 
LEAVING THE NERN FCST AREA BY 12Z. WILL GO AS A PERIOD OF SHOWERS 
OVERNIGHT (TOWARDS MORNING) IN THE SOUTHWEST HALF, AND ONLY CHANCE 
POPS DURING THE MORNING FOR THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST.

TEMPS LOOK TOO WARM TOMORROW. INITIAL THOUGHTS WERE READINGS IN THE 
70S BEHIND THE RAIN-COOLED AIR AND UNDER MOCLOUDY SKIES. I REALIZE 
THAT THERES WAA IN THE LOWEST LEVELS WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE WMFNT, 
BUT IT SHOULD BE COMING FROM A CLOUDY REGION. MID TO UPPER 80S FROM 
TH ETA IS TOO HIGH. WILL TREND TOWARDS LOWER FWC AND UNDERCUT THE 
MAV SLIGHTLY. OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT IN THE MID 
TO UPPER 60S UNDER MOCY SKIES. 

AVN CONTINUES TO HOLD BACK ON THE H5 TROF OVER THE CENTRAL US. THIS 
IS COMING MORE IN LINE WITH THE ETA, AND LOWERS THE CHANCE OF PRECIP 
FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY PM TO A 30 SCATTERED. WILL EXTEND THE 
PRECIP CHANCE INTO SATURDAY AND EXPECT THE SFC FNT TO BE OVER FCST

BE JUST E OF FCST AREA AT 12Z SUNDAY. THIS IS IN LINE WITH ETA AND 
SIGNIFICANTLY SLOWER THAN AVN/MRF. AM TRENDING TOWARDS THIS SOLUTION.

AFTER THIS, WILL STILL HOLD ON TO YESTERDAYS THINKING THAT THE MRF 
IS GOING TO BE OFF BY AT LEAST A 12 HR PERIOD. VERY BROAD LONGWAVE 
TROF OVER A MAJORITY OF THE U.S. IN THE LATE PERIODS LOOKS LIKE A 
ZONAL FLOW PATTERN. EXPECT TO GO SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN CLIMATOLOGY ON

SHORT TERM FCST SEEMS TO HAVE LITTLE PROBLEMS WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER FCST AREA SLIDING TO THE EAST. SFC DWPTS TONIGHT ARE PROGGED TO 
RANGE FROM THE MID 40S TO MID 50S, WHICH SHOULD BE ABOUT 10 DEGREES 
UNDER THE TEMP. HOWEVER, WILL STILL INCLUDE MENTION OF PATCHY FOG 
SINCE LOW CLOUDS HAVE HELD UP A SWIFT DEPARTURE OF THE MOIST AIR. 
AVN BRINGS A GOOD BIT OF CI OVER CWA ON TUES, BUT ITS TIMED A BIT 
LATER IN THE OTHER MODELS. WILL EXPECT A FAIR TEMP RECOVERY AND LEAN 
TOWARDS SLIGHTLY WARMER MAV GUIDANCE HERE, WHICH WILL LEAD TO WARMER 
OVERNIGHT TEMPS, ESP WITH SLY FLOW AND INCREASED MOISTURE. 

NEXT SYSTEM TO COME IN ON AN INVERTED SFC TROF AND H5 S/W WITH 
ASSOCIATED VORTICITY LOBE OVERNIGHT TUES/WED MORNING. THIS PASSES 
THROUGH WITH A BRIEF SHOT OF CONVECTION EXPECTED DURING THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER BY 0Z THURS, A RELATIVELY WEAK VORT NOTICED ON 
THE ETA REALLY SPINS UP SOME CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK OVERNIGHT OVER 
KIND. H8 WIND FIELDS JUMP TO A 45KT JET AT 6Z, BUT A BROADER, WEAKER 
30 KT FLOW AT 0Z AND 12Z ON EITHER SIDE OF IT. 

TALKED WITH INDY AND AGREE THAT THIS FEATURE IS TOTALLY OUT OF THE 
BLUE. WILL KEEP WED PM DRY. H5 TROF OVER THE MIDWEST IS DEEPER ON 
THE AVN, BUT THE PREVIOUS AVN RUN WAS CUTTING IT OFF AND GOING WAY 
NEGATIVE TILT. IT (AVN) SEEMS TO BE COMING MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
BROADER FEATURES OF THE ETA. WILL PLAY THE H5 PATTERN A LITTLE 
SLOWER AND DEEPER, WHICH HAS BROUGHT UP TEMPS QUITE A BIT FOR ERN 
FCST AREA THURSDAY AND ENTIRE FCST AREA THURS PM.

AFTER THIS TIME FRAME, ENSEMBLE FORECASTS ARENT THE BEST TO GO OFF 
OF, BUT WILL CONTINUE THE TREND OF THE CANADIAN FCST WITH A BROAD H5 
TROF OVER THE NRN MIDSECTION OF THE U.S. AND GENERALLY HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER OHVLY. THIS WILL RESULT IN A CLIMATOLOGY FCST WITH HIGHS IN THE

SINCE LOW CLOUDS HAVE HELD UP A SWIFT DEPARTURE OF THE MOIST AIR. 
AVN BRINGS A GOOD BIT OF CI OVER CWA ON TUES, BUT ITS TIMED A BIT 
LATER IN THE OTHER MODELS. WILL EXPECT A FAIR TEMP RECOVERY AND LEAN 
TOWARDS SLIGHTLY WARMER MAV GUIDANCE HERE, WHICH WILL LEAD TO WARMER 
OVERNIGHT TEMPS, ESP WITH SLY FLOW AND INCREASED MOISTURE. 

NEXT SYSTEM TO COME IN ON AN INVERTED SFC TROF AND H5 S/W WITH 
ASSOCIATED VORTICITY LOBE OVERNIGHT TUES/WED MORNING. THIS PASSES 
THROUGH WITH A BRIEF SHOT OF CONVECTION EXPECTED DURING THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER BY 0Z THURS, A RELATIVELY WEAK VORT NOTICED ON 
THE ETA REALLY SPINS UP SOME CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK OVERNIGHT OVER 
KIND. H8 WIND FIELDS JUMP TO A 45KT JET AT 6Z, BUT A BROADER, WEAKER 
30 KT FLOW AT 0Z AND 12Z ON EITHER SIDE OF IT. 

TALKED WITH INDY AND AGREE THAT THIS FEATURE IS TOTALLY OUT OF THE 
BLUE. WILL KEEP WED PM DRY. H5 TROF OVER THE MIDWEST IS DEEPER ON 
THE AVN, BUT THE PREVIOUS AVN RUN WAS CUTTING IT OFF AND GOING WAY 
NEGATIVE TILT. IT (AVN) SEEMS TO BE COMING MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
BROADER FEATURES OF THE ETA. WILL PLAY THE H5 PATTERN A LITTLE 
SLOWER AND DEEPER, WHICH HAS BROUGHT UP TEMPS QUITE A BIT FOR ERN 
FCST AREA THURSDAY AND ENTIRE FCST AREA THURS PM.

AFTER THIS TIME FRAME, ENSEMBLE FORECASTS ARENT THE BEST TO GO OFF 
OF, BUT WILL CONTINUE THE TREND OF THE CANADIAN FCST WITH A BROAD H5 
TROF OVER THE NRN MIDSECTION OF THE U.S. AND GENERALLY HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER OHVLY. THIS WILL RESULT IN A CLIMATOLOGY FCST WITH HIGHS IN THE 
MID TO UPPER 70S, LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S WITH A BASICALLY DRY 
PATTERN.

DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND THEY SUGGEST THAT EVERYTHING WILL BE 
SLOWER TO MOVE TO THE EAST THAN SHOWN IN PREVIOUS RUNS.

A FAIR AMOUNT OF ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT GENERALLY ALONG 
THE I-71 CORRIDOR WITH MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN WESTERN 
INDIANA AND ILLINOIS. MODELS SHOW SHORT WAVE SHEARING NORTHEAST INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY DURING THE DAY. IN ADDITION COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY

VERY MOIST AIRMASS TO PRODUCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE

ACTIVITY SHOULD DECREASE LATER IN THE DAY. BUT WITH SHORT WAVE AND 
SURFACE FRONT SLOW TO CLEAR THE AREA EXPECT TO STILL SEE SHOWERS AND 
A FEW THUNDERSTORMS LINGER INTO THE NIGHT GRADUALLY ENDING FROM WEST 
TO EAST.

APPEARS THAT LOW CLOUDS WILL PERSIST INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING. BUT 
DRIER AIR WILL ADVECT IN DURING THE DAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.

FCST QUESTIONS ARISE WITH THE AMOUNT AND LOCATION OF PRECIP IN THE 
NEXT 24-36 HOURS. WILL TRY TO ADD SOME TIMING WORDING AS THE ONLY 
WIDESPREAD CHANCE OF RAIN APPEARS TO BE DURING THE DAY SUNDAY. 
CURRENT SHOWERS ARE LOCATED ALONG THE AXIS OF PVA FROM THE MESOETA 
VS THE ACTUAL VORT MAXES. THIS IS NOTED WITH CONVECTION TO THE 
NORTHWEST AND TO THE SOUTH. HOWEVER, NONE OF THE 12 HOUR QPF FIELDS 
WERE EVEN CLOSE AT 12Z THIS MORNING. AM INCLINED TO LEAN TOWARDS 
THAT PRECIP MIN NOTED ON THE ETA MODELS FOR TONIGHT, BUT WILL HAVE 
AT LEAST CHANCE POPS IN ALL AREAS.

SFC FRONT APPROACHES SUNDAY WITH A GOOD SHOT OF CONVECTION EXPECTED 
ACROSS ENTIRE FCST AREA. SFC FEATURES ON THE FRONT BECOME A BIT 
NEBULOUS AS ENERGY APPROACHES APPALACHIANS. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH IF 
ANY PRECIP SUN PM IN THE NORTHWEST, AND ONLY A CHANCE IN THE 
SOUTHEAST. 

WILL TREND COOLER ON TEMPS AFTER TONIGHT, BUT NOT TOO FAR FROM 
GUIDANCE IN ANY CASE.

IN THE EXTENDED, MODELS SPIN UP A S/W TROF OVER ARKANSAS ON TUE AND 
MOVE IT TOWARDS THE GTLKS/OHVLY RGN ON WED. RELATED SFC INVERTED 
TROF PUSHES INTO SRN FCST AREA EARLY WED MORNING ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE RETREATING HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM AND MOVES NORTH THROUGH FCST 
AREA DURING THE DAY. ETA AT H84 SUPPORTS THIS SOLUTION, BUT CANADIAN 
AND ECMWF DONT HAVE THIS SCENARIO. A DRY PUNCH IS NOTED FOR WED PM 
AND THURSDAY BETWEEN THIS INVERTED TROF AND THE APPROACH OF A DEEPER 
H5 TROF AND ASSOCIATED SFC LOW THURS PM. 

WILL INCLUDE THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY AND THEN 
KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM THURS PM THROUGH 
FRIDAY, ENDING BY THE EVENING. MODELLERS SUGGEST A QUICKER SOLUTION 
TO THIS LOW, SO EXPECT THE FRONT TO BE THROUGH ON SATURDAY WITOUT 
THE WRAP-AROUND PRECIP. SPAGHETTI PLOTS AFTER DAY 4-5 ARE ALL OVER

NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF PRECIPITATION ON AREA RADARS AT THIS TIME. 
WOULD HAVE EXPECTED A LITTLE MORE COVERAGE WITH SHORT WAVE AND LOW 
LEVEL JET. BUT MAY YET SEE AN INCREASE INTO THE MORNING AS SUGGEST 
BY THE LATEST RAPID UPDATE CYCLE. OF THE LONGER TERM MODEL RUNS 
APPEARS THAT THE ETA HAS THE BETTER HANDLE SO WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW 
ITS SOLUTION. THIS IS ALSO FAIRLY SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS FORECASTS.

SHORT WAVE IN THE AREA WILL MOVE OFF TO THE EAST BY AFTERNOON. IN 
ADDITION BETTER LOW LEVEL WINDS FIELDS WILL SHIFT EAST. SO EXPECT 
BETTER CHANCE OF RAIN TO BE THIS MORNING. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE 
PROBABILITIES EXCEPT FOR SOUTHEAST ZONES WHERE COVERAGE SHOULD BE A 
LITTLE MORE. TEMPERATURES WILL GET OFF TO A WARM START TODAY AND 
WITH SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ESPECIALLY IN WESTERN ZONES BELIEVE 
THAT HIGHS SHOULD REACH WARMER GUIDANCE VALUES.

EXPECT A LULL IN PRECIPITATION FROM LATE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING 
BUT NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO TIME THAT OUT IN THE FORECAST. EXPECT TO 
SEE AN INCREASING CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS A FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. WITH SOME UPPER SUPPORT APPEARS THAT 
BETTER CHANCE OF RAIN OVERNIGHT WILL BE ACROSS NORTHERN OHIO. WILL 
STICK CLOSE TO MAV NUMBERS ALTHOUGH IF LITTLE OR NO RAIN FALLS 
TEMPERATURES COULD END UP BEING SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER.

ETA AND AVIATION ARE NOW IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE FRONTAL 
MOVEMENT AS WELL AS THE WAVE ALONG THE FRONT. EXPECT A BETTER CHANCE 
OF RAIN IN EASTERN ZONES AS FRONT INTERACTS WITH DEEPER MOISTURE. 
ETA GUIDANCE SEEMS TOO WARM UNLESS THERE ARE SIGNIFICANTLY FEWER 
CLOUDS THAN MODELS CURRENTLY SUGGEST. SO WILL JUST ADD A FEW DEGREES 
TO THE USUALLY TOO COOL MAV TEMPERATURES.

MODELS INDICATING A WARM UP AND RAPID RETURN OF MOISTURE AS FLOW 
BECOME SOUTHERLY. APPEARS THAT TODAY WILL PRIMARILY DEAL WITH HIGH 
AND MID CLOUDS. ALTHOUGH THEY MAY BECOME MORE OPAQUE LATER IN THE 
DAY STILL BELIEVE TEMPERATURES SHOULD REBOUND INTO THE LOWER TO MID 
80S EVEN WITH A COOL START. 

LOW LEVEL JET WILL DEVELOP OVERNIGHT AND WITH RETURNING MOISTURE 
EXPECT TO SEE LOWER CLOUDS DEVELOP ALONG WITH SOME SHOWERS DUE TO 
SPEED CONVERGENCE. ONCE AGAIN WILL STAY CLOSE TO MAV TEMPERATURES.

WITH LITTLE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WILL HAVE TO RELY ON LOW LEVEL 
FORCING WHICH SEEMS TO SHIFT OFF TO THE EAST DURING THE DAY. HAVE 
KEPT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AREAWIDE BUT BETTER 
CHANCE SHOULD BE IN THE EAST. SEEMS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A CHANCE TO 
WARM UP IN THE AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY IN WESTERN ZONES SO WILL GO 
CLOSER BUT NOT QUITE AS WARM AS THE WARMER ETA GUIDANCE. 

THEN HAVE TO CONSIDER MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
ETA IS DEVELOPING A WAVE ALONG THE FRONT AS A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
HANGS BACK TO THE WEST WHILE THE AVIATION JUST DRIVES THE SHORT WAVE 
AND BOUNDARY THROUGH. ANOTHER COMPLICATING FACTOR IS THE MOVEMENT OF 
TD9 OUT AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY. BASED ON THE LATEST NHC POSITION FOR 
SUNDAY EVENING THE AVIATION IS MUCH TOO FAST TO MOVE THIS OFF TO THE 
NORTHEAST WHILE THE ETA AT LEAST HAS A LOW IN THE GENERAL VICINITY 
OF THE NHC FORECAST. ETA IS PROBABLY OVERDONE WITH THE WAVE ALONG 
THE FRONT BUT THE AVIATION IS PROBABLY TOO FAST WHICH MEANS A 
COMPROMISE IS IN ORDER. WILL TRY TO HAVE A BREAK IN THE 
PRECIPITATION SATURDAY EVENING BUT THEN CARRY A CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. WILL ALSO 
LINGER SOME SHOWERS IN THE SOUTHEASTERN ZONE SUNDAY EVENING IN CASE 
SOME LEFT OVER MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF THE TROPICAL SYSTEM CAN

COLD FRONT IS JUST ABOUT THROUGH OUR SERN CWFA THIS MORNING.  THE 
FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH SOUTH AND EAST TODAY.  COOLER...DRY AIR 
IS IN STORE FOR OUR REGION.  BIG QUESTION FOR TODAY IS WHETHER TO GO 
PARTLY CLOUDY OR MOSTLY SUNNY.  FIRST OF ALL...THERE IS A BAND OF 
POST FRONTAL STRATOCUMULUS STRETCHING FROM NE OHIO INTO MISSOURI.  
THIS BAND OF CLOUDS WILL LIKELY BE LINGERING IN THE FAR SRN CWFA BY 
SUNRISE WHILE THE NORTHERN AREAS BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR.  HOWEVER... 
WITH CAA...SOME 850 MB MSTR...CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT SHOULD COMMENCE 
AROUND 11 AM OR SO.  THEN...AS THE DAY CONTINUES INTO THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS...THE CUMULUS CLOUDS SHOULD RISE HIGH ENOUGH TO BEGIN MIXING 
WITH DRIER AIR ABOVE THE 850 MB LEVEL...THUS DECREASING THE 
COVERAGE.  WITH SUCH A CHAOTIC SCENARIO...THE BEST OPTION AT THIS 
POINT IS TO GO WITH PARTLY CLOUDY.  AVN GUIDANCE TEMPS SEEM TO BE 
REASONABLE FOR TODAY/S HIGHS GIVEN 850 MB TEMPS AND THICKNESS 
SCHEMES.

FOR TONIGHT...SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION 
...ALLOWING FOR CLEARING SKIES.  WITH THE MUCH DRIER AIR AND WINDS 
BECOMING LIGHT IN MOST LOCATIONS...THEIR SHOULD BE A GOOD RANGE IN 
TEMPS ACRS THE CWFA...ESPECIALLY IN RURAL/VALLEY LOCATIONS VERSUS 
THE CITIES.  HAVE TRIED TO COME UP WITH A GENERALLY RANGE OF 47 TO 
52 MOST LOCATIONS...EXCEPT A LITTLE COOLER IN THE SOUTH CENTRAL 
OHIO/EASTERN CENTRAL OHIO LOCATIONS WHERE A 43 TO 48 DEGREE RANGE 
WILL BE EMPLOYED.

SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE OHIO VALLEY REGION ON 
THURSDAY.  AS A RESULT...MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED.  WITH 
AIRMASS MODIFICATION AND PLENTY OF SUNSHINE...TEMPS SHOULD BE 
SIMILAR TO TODAY/S VALUES.

THE FLOW ALOFT FOR THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WILL BECOME MORE

NORTHEAST-SOUTHWEST ORIENTED FRONT HAS MADE IT INTO THE NORTHWEST 
CORNER OF OHIO WITH PRECIPITATION OCCURRING BEHIND THE FRONT IN 
NORTHERN INDIANA. BUT THAT AREA OF SHOWERS HAS BEEN DIMINISHING. 
EVENING SOUNDING SHOWED LITTLE INSTABILITY AND A RATHER PRONOUNCED 
INVERSION AROUND 400 MILLIBARS. EXPECT ANY PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS TO 
BE LIGHT. WILL HOLD ONTO CHANCE PROBABILITIES IN NORTHWEST ZONES. 
BUT SLIGHT CHANCE WILL PROBABLY BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT ELSEWHERE AS 
FORCING WEAKENS. WITH THE LACK OF INSTABILITY AND DECREASE IN 
LIGHTNING ACTIVITY UPSTREAM WILL ALSO REMOVE THE MENTION OF THUNDER. 

GIVEN SATELLITE TRENDS WELL BEHIND THE FRONT BELIEVE THAT ANY 
CLEARING WILL BE QUITE LATE. SO WILL KEEP CLOUD COVER GOING ALL 
NIGHT. THUS MAY ALSO BUMP LOW TEMPERATURES UP SLIGHTLY.

07Z SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AM SHOWED MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACRS THE 
REGION.  THE PATCHES OF CIRRUS CURRENTLY OVER THE REGION WILL THIN 
AND SHIFT OFF TO THE EAST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING HOURS.  

THIS WILL BE THE LAST OF THE HOT DAYS.  A COLD FRONT OVER THE 
WESTERN GREAT LAKES AND NORTHERN PLAINS WILL MOVE SOUTH OF THE OHIO 
RIVER BETWEEN 2 AM AND 3 AM EDT TONIGHT.  IN THE MEANTIME...THE 
AIRMASS WILL REMAIN RELATIVE DRY AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AS LOW 
LEVEL ANTICYCLONIC FLOW PREVAILS FOR MOST OF THE DAY.  AS A 
RESULT...SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY.  850 MB FCST TEMPS FOR LATE 
THIS AFTN WILL APCH THE +19 TO +21 DEGREE RANGE...SO SFC TEMPS 
SHOULD BE CLOSE TO YESTERDAY/S HIGHS.  THUS...WILL CONTINUE WITH 
PREVIOUS FORECAST WITH HIGHS RANGING FROM THE LOWER 90S NORTH TO THE 
UPPER 90S FAR SOUTH.  CMH AND CVG WILL COME WITHIN TWO DEGREES OF 
THEIR RECORD HIGH TEMPS...SO WILL WORD THIS IN TODAY/S FCST.

FOR TONIGHT...THE COLD FRONT WILL BE MOISTURE STARVED ACRS OUR 
REGION.  THE STRONGER S/WV ASSOCD WITH THIS FRONT IS POISED TO MOVE 
INTO NY STATE.  HENCE...WITH A LACK OF MSTR AND ANY SIGNIFICANT UPR 
DIV/LOW LVL CONV...WILL ONLY CONT WITH A LOW CHC POP.  SKIES WILL 
CLEAR BEHIND THE FRONT OVERNIGHT.

MUCH COOLER AIR IS EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY AS 850 MB TEMPS PLUMMET 
INTO THE +10 TO +12 DEGREE RANGE.  HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOUT 
20 DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY/S HIGHS.  MODELS ARE FORECASTING SOME 
850 MB MSTR.  THIS COMBINED WITH DAY TIME HEATING SHOULD DEVELOP A 
SCT TO BKN CUMULUS DECK BY EARLY AFTN.

AFTN CUMULUS CLOUDS SHOULD DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
SFC HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO BUILD INTO OHIO BY THURSDAY 
MORNING.  WITH MUCH DRIER AIR AND LIGHTER WINDS...OVERNIGHT LOWS
WILL BE FALL-LIKE.  THE MAJOR CITIES SHOULD COOL TO AROUND 50 TO 52

GO AHEAD AND REMOVE MENTION OF PCPN FROM TUESDAY AS DEEPER MOISTURE

SOME SUBTLE MODEL DIFFERENCES TODAY.  MODELS DO AGREE ON THE OVERALL 
PATTERN THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...WHICH LEAVES THE FA UNDER HIGH 
PRESSURE AT BOTH THE SURFACE AND 500 MB.  THIS IS ALLOWING US TO 
WARM INTO THE 90S DURING THE DAY...BUT THEN TO DROP TO 55 TO 65 AT 
NIGHT.  MODELS HAD BEEN TRYING TO INCREASE THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN 
THE PREVIOUS RUNS...AND SOME CU HAS FORMED TODAY...BUT WITH THIS RUN 
THEY ARE KEEPING DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 60S DURING THE DAY....THEN 
DROPPING THEM A LITTLE AT NIGHT.  THIS FINALLY LOOKS REASONABLE.

TONIGHT LOOKS LIKE A CARBON COPY OF LAST NIGHT...SO WILL FORECAST 
TEMPERATURES THE SAME AS LAST NIGHTS LOWS.  

ETA CONTINUES TO BE THE WARMEST WITH THE 850MB TEMPS...RUNNING 
AROUND 20C.  THE NGM AND AVN GIVE 17 TO 18C UNTIL THE FRONT PUSHES 
THROUGH.  THIS WOULD EXPLAIN THE COOLER TEMPERATURES FORECAST ON THE 
MAV AND FWC GUIDANCE.  SEE NO REAL CHANGE FOR TOMORROW...SO WILL 
REPEAT TODAYS FORECAST HIGHS TOMORROW.

OTHER MODEL DIFFERENCES COME TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT.  ETA IS 
VERY SLOW WITH APPROACHING COLD FRONT...NOT PUSHING IT INTO THE FA 
UNTIL AFTER 00Z WEDNESDAY.  AVN MEANWHILE HAD IT INTO SOUTHERN OHIO 
AT 00Z WEDNESDAY.  PREFER THE SLOWER ETA SOLUTION...SO WILL BUMP 
TEMPERATURES UP ON TUESDAY INTO THE 90S AND WILL LIMIT POPS TO THE 
NORTH IN THE AFTERNOON. AS FRONT SWINGS THROUGH ON TUESDAY NIGHT 
WILL PUT A 30 POP ACROSS THE FA.  WILL BUMP MAV GUIDANCE UP ABOUT 5

AVN AND MAV DEWPOINTS ARE TOO HIGH AT INITIALIZATION.  BOTH RAW ETA

UPPER AIR PATTERN SHOWS LOW AMPLITUDE TROF BEGINNING TO INFLUENCE 
THE ILN CWA.  MOST OF DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROF WILL REMAIN 
OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND SOUTHERN CANADA.  HOWEVER...SOME PVA AND 
COOLING ALOFT WILL OCCUR OVER THE REGION TODAY INTO TONIGHT.

TROF IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY AS IT MOVES OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST BY 
THURSDAY EVENING.  UPPER RIDGE IS FCST TO REBUILD OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY BY THE WEEKEND.  

SFC MAP HAS A COLD FRONT NEAR CHICAGO AT 06Z.  MODELS ARE CLOSE WRT 
FRONTAL POSITION WITH AVN HAVING SLIGHTLY BETTER REPRESENTATION.  
FRONT IS ACTIVE WITH TSRA OUT AHEAD OF IT IN MICHIGAN...WHERE 
STRONGER UPPER SUPPORT EXISTS.  FRONT WILL ARRIVE IN ILN CWA BY 
AFTERNOON...AND THEN MOVE TO AROUND CVG BY 00Z.  THOUGH BETTER UPPER 
SUPPORT WILL STAY NORTH...ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE WILL BE 
AROUND THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY TONIGHT TO WARRANT CHANCE POPS ALL 
ZONES.

CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER EXISTS THOUGH IT APPEARS MARGINAL AT THIS 
TIME.  INSTABILITY AND WIND FIELDS WILL BE MODERATELY STRONG...AND 
MID LEVEL DRYING WILL BE FAVORABLE.  BEST CHANCE FOR SEVERE WILL BE 
NEAR CMH WHERE WINDS WILL BE A BIT STRONGER.   

FRONT IS PERPENDICULAR TO THE UPPER FLOW AND THUS SHOULD EXIT THE 
REGION BY LATE TONIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW THE FRONT GIVING 
MOSTLY SUNNY/CLEAR SKIES THROUGH THURSDAY.  

TEMPS:  MAV AND FWC LOOK TOO LOW AND MET LOOKS TOO HIGH...SO ILL 
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE.  TEMPS WILL LIKELY COOL INTO THE 50S THURSDAY 
MORNING IN HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND THE FRONT.  

.ILN...NONE.

FORECAST MODEL SOUNDINGS HAVE SHOWN A MID LVL ISOTHERMAL/INVERSION 
LAYER ABOVE 700 MB...WHICH SEEMS TO BE INHIBITING THE GROWTH OF THE 
SHOWERS.  IN FACT...THERE HAVE ONLY BEEN A FEW CLOUD TO GROUND 
LIGHTNING STRIKES.  WATER VAPOR AND MODELS SHOW AN AXIS OF VORTICITY 
TO MOVE ACRS THE CWFA BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z.  CONVECTION SEEMS TO BE 
HIGHLY DRIVEN BY DAY TIME HEATING AS THERE IS A LACK OF LOW LVL 
CONVERGENCE.  WILL KEEP SCATTERED SHOWERS/TSTMS IN THE FCST ALL 
LOCATIONS UNTIL AT LEAST MIDNIGHT.  THIS WILL GIVE THE EVENING SHIFT 
AMPLE TIME TO FINE TUNE ANY LINGERING ACTIVITY OVERNIGHT.

NEXT COLD FRONT TO PUSH THROUGH THE REGION BETWEEN 21Z TUESDAY 
NORTHWEST TO ABOUT 06Z WEDNESDAY SOUTHEAST.  AVN AND ETA MODELS ARE 
IN CLOSE AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING.  UPR LVL DYNAMICS ASSOCD WITH THIS 
FRONT IS FORECAST TO STAY NORTH OF OUR REGION.  THUS...DAY TIME 
HEATING...POOLING OF LOW LVL MSTR AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND SOME LOW 
LVL CONVERGENCE FROM THE SFC TO 925 MB SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR ABOUT A 
30 TO 40 POP ACRS THE CWFA FROM TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING 
HOURS.  TEMPS WILL BE TRICKY.  THERE IS A WIDE RANGE IN FORECAST 
GUIDANCE.  FOR INSTANCE...THE AVN MAV GUIDANCE IS FORECASTING 85 FOR 
DAY...THE NGM FWC MOS IS FORECASTING 89 FOR DAYTON...WHILE THE ETA 
MOS IS FORECASTING 97 FOR DAYTON.  THE TREND HAS BEEN FOR THE PAST 
FEW WEEKS NOW THAT THE MAV HAS BEEN TOO COOL AND THE ETA MOS WAY TOO 
WARM.  A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO VALUES (RESULTING IN A VALUE 
WHICH IS A LITTLE WARMER THAN THE NGM MOS GUIDANCE) HAVE BEEN 
WORKING THE BEST.  THUS...HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S LOOKS 
GOOD ATTM.

THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH OF THE SRN CWFA TUESDAY NIGHT 
...USHERING IN DRIER AIR FOR WEDNESDAY.  SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY 
OR SUNNY.

DRY WEATHER SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEKEND 
...UNTIL ANOTHER FRONT AND MOISTURE IN W TO SW FLOW ALOFT APCH THE

AREA OF CONVERGENCE NEAR SURFACE TROUGH SHOULD DISSIPATE RATHER 
QUICKLY WITH LOSS OF HEATING. CUMULUS FIELD SHOULD ALSO DIMINISH

NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION IN NORTHERN ZONES ALTHOUGH LOW LEVEL FORCING

PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT ON BRINGING COLD FRONT INTO NORTHWEST PART OF

HAS DIMINISHED. WITH HEATING COULD SEE SOME ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND

COVERAGE OF PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN RATHER LIMITED TODAY WITH WEAK 
FORCING AROUND UPPER LOW TO THE SOUTH. ALSO BETTER MOISTURE INFLOW 
IS BEING INTERCEPTED BY PRECIPITATION SHIELD ALONG THE ATLANTIC 
COAST. EXPECT SHOWERS TO REMAIN ISOLATED FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS AS 
PATTERN DOES NOT SHOW MUCH CHANGE. INSTABILITY ALSO LOOKS LIMITED SO 
WILL ONLY MENTION SHOWERS EXCEPT FOR THE SOUTHEAST ZONE WHERE A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE.

UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND EVENTUALLY LIFTS OUT OVER THE 
WEEKEND. HOWEVER INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WILL SWING BACK TO THE WEST 
ON SATURDAY WHICH COULD BRING A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS. BELIEVE AVIATION MODEL HAS SHIFTED THIS SYSTEM A 
BIT TOO FAR WEST. SO WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY FOR NOW EXPECTING 
PRECIPITATION TO BE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THEN.

STATISTICAL GUIDANCE APPEARS TO HAVE A COLD BIAS FOR MAXIMUM 
TEMPERATURES SO HAVE GONE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER. HOWEVER LOWS SEEMS 
FAIRLY CLOSE FROM THE WARMER FWC NUMBERS.

FOR THE MEDIUM RANGE PORTION OF THE FORECAST WILL CONTINUE TO GO 
ALONG WITH THE IDEA OF A FRONTAL PASSAGE ON TUESDAY. MOISTURE MAY BE 
LIMITED BUT THIS STILL WARRANTS A MENTION OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. SUSPECT TEMPERATURES COULD WARM UP QUITE A BIT AHEAD 
OF THIS SYSTEM ON MONDAY AND IN THE SOUTH ON TUESDAY.

SFC MAP HAS WEAK LOW OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS...WITH A TROF

SOUTH WITH THE UPPER LOW.  

SFC AIRMASS IS RATHER MOIST AND UNSTABLE...BUT THERE HAS BEEN  
LITTLE SFC CONVERGENCE TO PROVIDE FOCUS FOR ORGANIZED CONVECTION.  
ALSO...CAP THAT HAS SO FAR PREVENTED DEEP CONVECTION EXISTS ACROSS 
SOUTHERN OHIO.

VORT MAX IS PROVIDING UPPER SUPPORT FOR TSRA OVER EASTERN

LOOKS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION FOR 
THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. SEVERAL FACTORS INVOLVED WHICH 
COULD MAKE FINAL SOLUTION A BIT COMPLICATED. 

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA CLOSE TO OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARY AND 
IN AXIS OF BEST INSTABILITY. THESE STORMS APPEAR PRIMARILY 
DIURNALLY DRIVEN AND SO EXPECT THEM TO DIMINISH THIS EVENING. A LINE 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS APPEAR RELATED TO 
A CONVECTIVE VORTICITY CENTER. WITH THIS SUPPORT WOULD THINK THAT 
THESE STORMS WILL CONTINUE INTO THE NIGHT. EXTRAPOLATION WOULD BRING 
THIS INTO THE SOUTHERN ZONES AFTER DARK. ANOTHER SHORT WAVE IS 
FORECAST TO MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TAKING A SURFACE LOW ACROSS 
NORTHERN OHIO. AND THIS SHOULD BE ANOTHER TRIGGER FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUING OR POSSIBLY REDEVELOPING DURING THE NIGHT. 
GIVEN ALL OF THIS WILL GO WITH 60 TO 80 PROBABILITIES. WILL CONTINUE 
TO MENTION HEAVY RAIN AS MOISTURE WILL BE PLENTIFUL ALLOWING FOR 
VERY HEAVY DOWNPOURS. HOWEVER FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE IS HIGH AND 
EXPECT THE STORMS TO BE PROGRESSIVE SO DO NOT FEEL THERE IS A NEED 
FOR A WATCH.

PRECIPITATION MAY LINGER INTO THE MORNING ACROSS SOUTHEAST HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA SO WILL KEEP A CHANCE THROUGH THE MORNING. BUT ALL 
MODELS SHOW DEEPER MOISTURE BEING SHUNTED OFF TO THE EAST DURING THE 
DAY. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY LINGER AND AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH AFTERNOON HEATING. BUT 
BELIEVE CHANCE IS TOO LOW TO WARRANT A CONTINUED MENTION IN THE 
FORECAST.

THE AREA SHOULD DRY OUT FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND. THERE IS STILL 
A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR THE FORECAST NEXT WEEK AS 
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO HAVE QUITE A BIT OF VARIABILITY IN 
THEIR SOLUTIONS. DO NOT WANT TO MAKE MUCH OF A CHANGE UNTIL THINGS 
BECOME A LITTLE CLEARER SO WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY FOR NOW.

.ILN...NONE.

KEEPS THE QPF ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD...WHILE THE NGM AND AVN 
SPREAD QPF SOUTH OF I-70 BY 00Z. GETTING MIXED SIGNALS FROM THE 
MODELS.  850MB THETA-E RIDGE IS PUSHED TO NEAR I-70 BY 00Z...WHICH 
WOULD SUGGEST THE CHANCE OF CONVECTION A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH THAN 
WHAT THE ETA HAS.  BUT ACROSS SOUTHERN OHIO THERE IS A LACK OF 
MOSITURE WHICH SHOWS UP NICELY IN THE PRECIPIATION EFFECIANCIES.  
WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT 30 POPS ACRSS THE NORTHWEST...BUT 
WILL ADD 20 POPS ELSEWHERE NORTH OF I-70.  WILL LEAVE SOUTHERN ZONES 
DRY FOR TODAY. 

TONIGHT THE THETA-E RIDGE PUSHES TO THE OHIO RIVER.  THERE IS A 
CONTINUED LACK OF MOISTURE IN THE SOUTH.  WILL CONTINUE WITH THE 
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE NORTH...BUT DUE TO LACK OF MOSITURE AND UPPER 
SUPPORT WILL CONTINUE TO LEAVE THE SOUTH DRY.

FOR FRIDAY...BOTH ETA AND AVN ARE HAVING PROBELMS RESOLVING 
INDIVIDUAL VORTS AHEAD OF THE MAIN SHORTWAVE DROPPING THROUGH THE 
GREAT LAKES.  THESE DIFFERENCES AFFECT THE DEVLOPMENT OF A SURFACE 
LOW ALONG THE FRONT.  ETA IS WEAKER AND SLOWER WITH THE LOW AS 
COMPARED TO THE AVN.  THE AVN LOOKS A LITTLE QUICK...SO WILL LEAN 
TOWARDS THE ETA.

NUMEROUS MODEL DIFFERENCES THIS RUN...SO WILL TRY AND HIT THE 
HIGHLIGHTS.

MODELS AGREE IN DROPPING FRONT INTO NORTHERN OHIO LATER TODAY.  ETA 
KEEPS THE QPF ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD...WHILE THE NGM AND AVN 
SPREAD QPF SOUTH OF I-70 BY 00Z. GETTING MIXED SIGNALS FROM THE 
MODELS.  850MB THETA-E RIDGE IS PUSHED TO NEAR I-70 BY 00Z...WHICH 
WOULD SUGGEST THE CHANCE OF CONVECTION A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH THAN 
WHAT THE ETA HAS.  BUT ACROSS SOUTHERN OHIO THERE IS A LACK OF 
MOSITURE WHICH SHOWS UP NICELY IN THE PRECIPIATION EFFECIANCIES.  
WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT 30 POPS ACRSS THE NORTHWEST...BUT 
WILL ADD 20 POPS ELSEWHERE NORTH OF I-70.  WILL LEAVE SOUTHERN ZONES 
DRY FOR TODAY. 

TONIGHT THE THETA-E RIDGE PUSHES TO THE OHIO RIVER.  THERE IS A 
CONTINUED LACK OF MOISTURE IN THE SOUTH.  WILL CONTINUE WITH THE 
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE NORTH...BUT DUE TO LACK OF MOSITURE AND UPPER 
SUPPORT WILL CONTINUE TO LEAVE THE SOUTH DRY.

FOR FRIDAY...BOTH ETA AND AVN ARE HAVING PROBELMS RESOLVING 
INDIVIDUAL VORTS AHEAD OF THE MAIN SHORTWAVE DROPPING THROUGH THE 
GREAT LAKES.  THESE DIFFERENCES AFFECT THE DEVLOPMENT OF A SURFACE 
LOW ALONG THE FRONT.  ETA IS WEAKER AND SLOWER WITH THE LOW AS 
COMPARED TO THE AVN.  THE AVN LOOKS A LITTLE QUICK...SO WILL LEAN 
TOWARDS THE ETA.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S TO 
LOWER 90S.  WITH INCREASING MOISTURE SHOULD SEE SOME CLOUDS WHICH 
WILL HOLD TEMPS DOWN A LITTLE.   NOT MUCH CHANGE THE REST OF THE WAY.

WILL CONTINUE MSTLY CLR WORDING ACRS NORTHERN ZONES.  MID/HI LVL 
MOISTURE HANGS ON A LITTLE ALONG OH RIVER THROUGH MUCH OF NIGHT AND

COOLEST NIGHT IN A COUPLE WEEKS ACRS REGION.  WILL LIKELY SEE RURAL

TEMP RANGES FOR MOST OF FCST AREA.  NOT EXPECTING A WHOLE LOT OF FOG 
WITH AMPLE AMTS OF DRY AIR ACRS OH VALLEY TONIGHT.

ETA/AVN IN GOOD AGREEMENT TO START IN BUILDING UPR RIDGE BACK ACRS 
CWA ON WEDNESDAY.  HI PRES WILL MOVE TO NEW ENGLAND STATES WITH 
SOUTHERLY FLOW DVLPG DURING THE DAY.  MORE SUNSHINE AND WARMER FLOW 
WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO REBOUND INTO U80S ACRS MUCH OF CWA.

ENTIRE FCST AREA FRI AND SAT UNTIL FRONT MOVES THROUGH.  DRIER AND 
COOLER WX FOR END OF WEEKEND INTO ERLY NEXT WEEK.  SOME QUESTIONS

H8 THERMAL AXIS BEST NOTED IN THE THICKNESS FIELD OVER FCST AREA 
TODAY. THIS AXIS GETS SITUATED W-E OVER NRN FCST AREA AND HIGHS 
UPSTREAM YESTERDAY UNDER THE SAME THICKNESS AND H8 TEMPS WERE RIGHT 
AROUND 90 DEGREES. WILL COME CLOSE TO THESE NUMBERS TODAY, BUT SKY 
COVER SHOULD HAMPER THIS BY A LITTLE.

VORT SWINGING INTO NWRN FCST AREA MAY PROVIDE A FOCUS FOR SOME SCT 
SHOWERS HERE, AND ANOTHER STRETCHED OUT VORT IN THE SOUTHEAST MAY DO 
THE SAME IN A MORE FAVORABLE MOISTURE ENVIRONMENT. WILL HAVE 30 POPS 
HERE AND SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THE REST OF THE FCST AREA TODAY WITH 
HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO AROUND 90 ACROSS THE BOARD. 

DEWPOINTS REMAIN IN THE UPPER 60S/NEAR 70 AND THIS SHOULD BE CLOSE 
TO NIGHTTIME LOWS OVER THE NEXT 2-3 DAYS. SATURDAY SHOULD BE A 
REPEAT OF TODAY. CURRENT FCST HAS 30 POPS IN ALL AREAS FOR PM 
SHOWERS, AND I COULD DROP DOWN TO A 20 FOR THE NORTHWEST HALF, BUT 
WILL ONLY DO THIS FOR THE FAR NORTHWEST GROUP. 

THICKNESSES INCREASE A BIT AHEAD OF THE FRONT PROGGED TO GO THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY. EXPECT ANOTHER DAY OF AROUND 90 TEMPS 
WITH SOME CLOUD COVER AND WIDELY SCT/SCT SHRA IN THE AFTERNOON FOR 
SATURDAY. 

WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN TO THE NORTH FOR SUNDAY, IT LOOKS 
LIKE WEVE GOT AT LEAST SOME BREAK FROM THE HOT AND HUMIDS. SAT PM 
LOWS WILL PROBABLY BE THE BIGGEST PROBLEM WHERE NWRN FCST AREA COULD 
SEE LOW OR MID 60S BUT AM NOT SURE THAT THE TEMPS WILL FOLLOW THE 
DEWPOINT GRADIENT QUITE AS FAST. ON SUNDAY, THE FRONT IS THROUGH 
FCST AREA BY PM AND THE CURRENT FCST HAS A FAIR HANDLE ON TIMING OF 
PRECIP. WILL REMOVE MENTION ON SUNDAY NIGHT IN THE SOUTHEAST SINCE 
MODELS HAVE PUSHED THE FRONT THROUGH A LITTLE QUICKER. 

IN ALL, NO BIG CHANGES TO FCST - SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO POPS AND 
TIMING DIFFERENCES ON THE FRONT ON DAY 3.

BY DAY TIME HEATING ALONG WITH A SHEAR AXIS OF UPR LVL VORTICITY 
OVER THE REGION.  KILN RADAR WAS BEGINNING TO SHOW SCATTERED SHOWER

PARTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT.  WILL MAKE A DECISION AT THE LAST 
MINUTE...BUT I AM LEANING TOWARD PC IN THE NW AND MC ELSEWHERE.  MOS 
GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR TONIGHT LOOK GOOD.

A WARM...MOIST AIR MASS REMAINS IN PLACE FOR FRIDAY.  FCST AREA 
BECOMES WEDGED BETWEEN TWO SYSTEMS.  THE FIRST WILL BE A COLD FRONT 
APCHING THE LOWER GREAT LAKES DURING THE AFTN.  THIS FRONT WILL NOT 
MAKE IT INTO OUR AREA...BUT ITS PROXIMITY AND ASSOCD UPR DIV SHOULD 
BRING A CHC OF SHOWERS/TSTMS TO THE FAR NW.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF 
THE FCST AREA...A S/WV OVER THE LOWER MS VLY WILL EJECT NE INTO THE 
MIDDLE OHIO VLY ON FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT.  AS OF NOW...BELIEVE 
NGM AND AVN ARE OVERDONE ON PCPN DEVELOPMENT.  AS A RESULT...WILL GO 
CHC OF SHOWERS/TSTMS REMAINDER OF FCST AREA (30 TO 40 POP) AND WILL 
GO WARMER THAN MOS GUIDANCE.

A CHC OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LINGER IN THE EVENING HOURS 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND PERHAPS MOST OF THE NIGHT SE AS SHEAR VORTICITY 
MOVES THROUGH.  AGAIN MOS TEMPS LOOK GOOD.

SATURDAY WILL BE A TYPICAL SUMMER DAY WITH A SMALL CHC OF AFTERNOON 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE 
WESTERN GREAT LAKES...MOVING INTO THE WRN CWFA BY SUNDAY MORNING.  
LOW LVL FORCING WEAKENS AS COLD FRONT APCHES REGION.  SO...DYNAMICS 
MAINLY ASSOCD WITH UPR LVL DIV OVERNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT.  WILL FCST 
40 POPS WEST AND 30 EAST SATURDAY NIGHT.

AVN IS MORE AGGRESSIVE ON PUSHING THE FRONT THROUGH THE ENTIRE CWFA 
BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON WHILE THE ETA IS SLOWER.  WILL USE A COMPROMISE 
AND KEEP POPS IN THE MORNING WEST AND ALL AFTERNOON EAST.

AFTER A SMALL CHC OF PCPN FOR THE FAR SE CWFA...SKIES SHOULD CLEAR 
SUNDAY NIGHT...FOLLOWED BY A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY ON MONDAY.  DRIER AIR

FRONT WASHES OUT ACROSS AREA AS FLOW STAYS SW TODAY AND THURSDAY

TODAY CANNOT BE RULED OUT...BUT IS NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE WITH THE

AREA LATE AFTERNOON TO EVENING AND THE MAIN SW MOVING INTO THE 
WESTERN FCST AREA LATE TONIGHT.  AVN IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THIS

SHORT TERM CONCERN IS POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WX WITH NEXT SYSTEM 
ENTERING TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. PROBLEMS OCCUR WITH MODEL 
DIFFERENCES ON HOW FAST THE RAIN CLEARS OUT ON THURSDAY. YESTERDAYS 
THINKING IS THAT THE H5 TROF WOULD BE THROUGH FCST AREA QUITE QUICK 
AND END THE PRECIP. LOOKING AT THE SPAGHETTI PLOTS AT 0Z FRIDAY, 
THERES A LOT OF VARIANCE WITH THIS FEATURE. 6Z AVN WAS SIMILAR 
PREVIOUS THINKING AND SCOOTS THE TROF TO THE APPALACHIANS AND 
QUICKLY WEAKENS IT BY 0Z FRI. HOWEVER, THE NEW RUN OF THE ETA HANGS 
THE TROF OVER WRN FCST AREA AND JUST WEAKENS IT TO A RETURN TO ZONAL 
FLOW INSTEAD OF CONTINUING TO PUSH IT EAST. THIS WOULD RELATE TO AN 
INCREASED CHANCE OF PRECIP ON THURS, BUT AM NOT ENTIRELY SURE WHICH 
SOLUTION IS RIGHT. 12Z AVN HAS HELD BACK A LITTLE WITH THE PASSAGE 
OF THE H5 TROF, BUT IS STILL THE MOST PROGRESSIVE MODEL. 

FIRST GUESS IS THAT THE DRY PUNCH IN THE MID LEVELS WILL NOT BE AS 
STRONG AS PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS SUGGEST. THIS WOULD REDUCE THE CHANCE 
FOR SEVERE ON WED AND HOLD THE TROF BACK ON THURS AS THE ETA 
SUGGESTS. CANADIAN IS TRENDING TOWARDS HANGING SOME PRECIP BACK ON 
THURSDAY TOO. WILL BUMP CHANCES ON THURSDAY TO A LIKELY 60 POP.

CLOUD COVER TOMORROW SEVERELY CUTS THE CAPES ACROSS FCST AREA AND 
THE FLOW DOESNT SUGGEST ANY STRONG MOISTURE CONVERGENCE. AM NOT 
GOING TO MENTION SEVERE THOUGH A COUPLE STORMS WILL PROBABLY GET 
THERE.

FOR THE SHORT TERM, IM TRENDING TOWARDS THE ETA SOLUTION ON WHERE 
THE H5 TROF AND MOISTURE FIELDS ARE LOCATED ON THURS ALTHOUGH AVN 
SOLUTION IS STILL QUITE CREDIBLE. CLOUD COVER AND RAIN COOLED 
AIRMASS IS HARD ON TEMPS FOR NEXT FEW DAYS. WILL BE AOA GUIDANCE 
TONIGHT, NR GUID WED, AND CUT BY AROUND A CAT WED PM (M60S) AND 
THURS (NR 80). EVENING PRECIP THURS TO END BY MIDNIGHT WITH LOWS IN 
THE MID 60S. CREDIBLE AVN SOLUTION WILL END PRECIP THURSDAY, BUT AM 
STILL GOING WITH THE SLOWER ETA. 

ETA CUTS OFF PRECIP TOMORROW NIGHT BUT BRINGS IT BACK IN BY MORNING. 
WILL HAVE SOME SORT OF WORDING WITH SCATTERED BECOMING NUMEROUS. 

ON THE EXTENDED, H5 AND SPAGHETTI CHARTS ARE CLOSE. SW FLOW IS THE 
DOMINANT FEATURE, AND THE GULF SEEMS TO BE FAIRLY OPEN. AVN IS 
BRINGING SHOWERS INTO THE SOUTH OVERNIGHT SATURDAY. CANADIAN IS 
SIMILAR. WILL NOT MENTION THUNDER ATTM. 

REST OF THE FCST WILL FEATURE AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS WITH A WARM 
SPELL (MUCH LIKE THE PREVIOUS FEW DAYS).

WITH SKIES REMAINING MOSTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT HAVE ONLY BEEN GETTING 
SOME LIGHT FOG DESPITE PLENTY OF SURFACE MOISTURE LEFT OVER FROM 
SUNDAYS CONVECTION IN PARTS OF THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN FORECAST 
AREA.

MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT IN SHOWING WEAK DISTURBANCE MOVING 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA TODAY WITH DRIER AIR ADVECTING IN FROM THE 
SOUTH. THUS CONDITIONS APPEAR TO BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR THE FORMATION 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHERN ZONES. EXPECT 
PRECIPITATION TO BE NORTH AND EAST OF THE AREA BEFORE EVENING AND 
THERE SHOULD BE SOME CLEARING LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. THESE 
CONDITIONS SHOULD ALLOW FOR A LATE RALLY IN TEMPERATURES WITH 
READINGS POSSIBLY PUSHING 90 AGAIN IN THE FAR SOUTH.

NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST CONTINUES TO TREND A BIT 
SLOWER. IT MAY BE CLOSE ENOUGH BY LATE TUESDAY NIGHT TO BRING A 
CHANCE OF RAIN TO WESTERN ZONES. BUT UNTIL THEN BELIEVE CHANCE WILL 
BE SLIM WITH LITTLE OR NO FOCUS. SO WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY TONIGHT 
AND TUESDAY. GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK FAIRLY REASONABLE FOR LOWS BUT 
SEEM TOO COOL FOR TUESDAYS HIGHS. GIVEN FORECAST THICKNESS BELIEVE 
READINGS WILL BE BACK IN THE LOWER 90S AREAWIDE.

STILL SEEMS TO BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR RAIN WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. BUT AM CONCERNED THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL NOT CLEAR THE AREA 
BEFORE THURSDAY. MODELS KEEP ON TRENDING SLOWER AND NOW THE LATEST 
ETA RUN SHOWS THE MAIN SHORT WAVE STILL BACK NEAR THE 
ILLINOIS/INDIANA BORDER THURSDAY MORNING WITH WEAKENING BOUNDARY 
SOMEWHERE NEAR THE AREA.

ETA HAS TRENDED TOWARDS WETTER SOLUTION THAT THE AVIATION MODEL HAS 
BEEN SHOWING FOR A WHILE. STILL FEEL THAT THIS IS OVERDONE BUT WILL 
MOVE FORECAST TO A SLIGHTLY WETTER SCENARIO.

HOWEVER FOR TODAY LOOKS LIKE PRECIPITATION MAY HOLD OFF UNTIL LATE 
IN THE DAY. AND AT THAT APPEARS THAT BEST CHANCE WILL BE IN SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS AS INCREASING MOISTURE WILL BE GREATEST THERE. ALSO WEAK 
UPPER SUPPORT SHOULD BE NEARBY. ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT DO DEVELOP 
COULD LINGER INTO THE EVENING. BELIEVE THICKER CLOUD COVER SHOULD 
HOLD OFF LONG ENOUGH FOR TEMPERATURES TO ONCE AGAIN RISE TO AROUND 
90 IF NOT A LITTLE BIT ABOVE THIS AFTERNOON.

PLUME OF DEEPER MOISTURE SEEN ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WILL SHIFT INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT. HAVE NOTICED A FEW SHOWERS DEVELOPING IN 
THIS PLUME OVERNIGHT IN MISSOURI AND SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. DOES NOT 
SEEM UNREASONABLE TO THINK THAT COULD HAPPEN ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA TONIGHT AS DEPICTED BY MODELS. BUT SUSPECT COVERAGE AND THUS 
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL BE LESS THAN WHAT GUIDANCE SHOWS. SO 
WILL GO WITH A LOW CHANCE LATE TONIGHT.

WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH 
MONDAY WITH A SOMEWHAT HIGHER PROBABILITY IN NORTHERN ZONES. AS LONG 
AS THICKER CLOUDS PERSIST AS SUGGESTED BY MODELS THEN TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE HELD DOWN IN THE MID 80S. HOWEVER SUSPECT THAT THERE COULD 
BE SOME FAIRLY DECENT BREAKS MOVING IN FROM WEST TO EAST IN THE 
AFTERNOON. IF THIS OCCURS EARLY ENOUGH THEN TEMPERATURES COULD JUMP 
UP QUITE A BIT.

NEXT SYSTEM IS LOOKING EVEN SLOWER AND LATEST GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THE 
BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BE ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER 
WEAK IMPULSES IN MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW COULD STILL TRIGGER SOME 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT.

DEGREES FROM YESTERDAYS READINGS. WITH FWC COMING IN LINE WITH 
WARMER MAV NUMBERS SEE LITTLE REASON TO VARY MUCH. MOISTURE WILL

SUFFICE.

AVIATION MODEL IS SHOWING STRONGER SHORT WAVES MOVING FROM THE

OVERDONE AND PREFER MORE SHEARED LOOK IN THE ETA. SO FORCING SHOULD 
BE WEAK AND MOISTURE MAY BE SLOW TO INCREASE. THUS CHANCE OF RAIN IS 
LOOKING SLIMMER. WITH IT ALREADY IN THE FORECAST WILL HOLD TO A LOW 
CHANCE FOR SUNDAY AND KEEP MONDAY PRECIPITATION FREE. CLOUD COVER

REGION THROUGH FRIDAY UNTIL A STRONG SHORT WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES PRODUCES HEIGHT FALLS ON SATURDAY.

SFC HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL GREAT LAKES WILL REMAIN DOMINANT 
THROUGH FRIDAY.  HIGH WILL THEN BE NUDGED TO THE EAST COAST BY 
SATURDAY AS THE UPPER RIDGE MOVES EAST.  AVN HAS THE HIGH MOVING 
MORE RAPIDLY TO THE COAST...WITH THE ETA KEEPING THE HIGH OVER LAKE 
ERIE THROUGH MOST OF FRIDAY.  A SLIGHT WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR AS 
THE HIGH MOVES EAST AND THE SFC FLOW MORPHS FROM EAST TO SOUTH.  

MODEL PROGS SHOW LITTLE MOISTURE THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT.  LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IS SHOWN TO INCREASE ON SATURDAY IN OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES 
AS THE SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW BECOMES ESTABLISHED.  THEREFORE...ILL 
KEEP MOSTLY CLEAR/MOSTLY SUNNY THROUGH SATURDAY...EXCEPT ILL GO 
WITH PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE SOUTH ON SATURDAY.

TEMPS:  ILL GO SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE FWC TOWARD THE MAV AND 
MET...WHICH ARE ONLY 1-2 DEGREES WARMER.  TONIGHTS LOW AT CVG 
SHOULD REMAIN NEAR 60 WITH ENE WIND BRINGING MILDER AIR OFF THE HEAT 
ISLAND.  OUTLYING AREAS SUCH AS WILMINGTON WILL SEE LOWER 50S AGAIN.

EXTENDED:  SHORT WAVE WITH LIMITED SFC CONVERGENCE WILL BRING LOW 
CHANCE TSRA FOR SUNDAY.  IVE REMOVED CHANCE FOR MONDAY SINCE SHORT 
WAVES ARE PROGGED TO SKIRT THE AREA.  AVN PORTENDS STRONGER SYSTEM 
FOR TUESDAY.

UPR LVL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID MS VLY THIS AM 
WILL BEGIN TO ELONGATE SW TO NE TODAY AS S/WV ENERGY AND COLD FRONT 
OVER THE UPR MS VLY/WRN GREAT LAKES BEGINS TO PUSH SOUTHEAST.

IR SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AM WAS ALREADY SHOWING CONVECTIVE DEBRIS 
FROM THE UPR MS RIVER VLY...IN THE FORM OF CIRRUS...SPILLING INTO 
OUR REGION.  BELIEVE THIS CIRRUS SHOULD BE THIN TODAY...SO IT SHOULD 
NOT INHIBIT MUCH WITH TEMPERATURE FORECASTS.  THIN CIRRUS ALONG WITH 
AFTN CUMULUS CLOUDS WILL MAKE FOR A PARTLY SUNNY FORECAST.  TODAY 
COULD BE POTENTIALLY THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE SUMMER.  850 MB TEMPS 
AND 1000 MB-850 MB THICKNESS SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE 94 TO 98 DEGREE 
RANGE.  UNLIKE YESTERDAY WHERE A LIGHT NE FLOW SEEMED TO KEEP TEMPS 
DOWN A TAD AT DAY AND CMH...A DEVELOPING SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW 
SHOULD BRING UNIFORM TEMPS TO THE ENTIRE REGION.  SOME CITIES...SUCH 
AS DAY AND CMH...WILL APPROACH RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES.

FOR TONIGHT...UPR RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO SAG SOUTH AND EVENTUALLY 
WESTWARD AS COLD FRONT MOVES TO SRN IOWA...NRN IL...NRN IN AND FAR 
NRN OHIO BY 12Z.  UPR LVL DYNAMICS BEGIN TO WEAKEN OVERNIGHT WITH 
ONLY WEAK CONVERGENCE ASSOCD WITH THE FRONT.  WEAK CONVERGENCE MAY 
BE ENOUGH FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ACROSS THE FAR NORTH...SO 
WILL CONTINUE WITH A CHC LATE THERE.  OTHERWISE...THE REMAINDER OF 
THE CWFA IS EXPECTED TO BE DRY.  OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE 
WARM...RANGING FROM 74 TO 76 DEGREES.

ON MONDAY...AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT SAGS INTO THE REGION.  ETA/AVN 
ARE IN SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THE FRONT.  WILL SIDE 
WITH THE ETA...HOWEVER...AS IT TENDS TO DEPICT MESOSCALE WINDS WITH 
FRONTAL SYSTEMS BETTER THAN THE AVN (BEING ON A FINER RESOLUTION).  
AGAIN...MOST OF THE UPR LVL DYNAMICS SHIFT OFF TO THE NORTH AND EAST 
OF THE CWFA.  THUS...SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE HIGHLY 
DEPENDENT ON DAY TIME HEATING.  FORECAST SOUNDINGS YIELD SBCAPES OF 
1500 TO 2000 BY PEAK HEATING.  THIS ENERGY...COMBINED WITH WEAK 
FORCING ASSOCD WITH THE FRONT...SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR A 40 PERCENT 
CHC OF SHOWERS/TSTMS ACROSS THE BOARD.

BY MONDAY NIGHT...COLD FRONT SAGS SOUTH OF THE CWFA AFTER MIDNIGHT.  
ANY LINGERING SHOWERS/TSTMS IN THE SRN CWFA WILL COME TO 
END...FOLLOWED BY CLEARING SKIES EVERYWHERE.  MUCH DRIER AIR WILL 
THEN FILTER INTO THE REGION.

FOR TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...LONG RANGE MODELS (MRF...UKMET) HAVE 
CONSISTENTLY SHOWN A COOLING TREND ACRS THE OHIO VLY AS SFC HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVES SOUTHEAST FROM ONTARIO CANADA INTO THE LOWER GREAT 
LAKES.  THUS...HAVE CUT BACK ON 90 DEGREE FCST FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...AND HAVE ALSO TRENDED DOWNWARD FOR THE OVERNIGHT LOWS.

WILL WAIT FOR A FEW MINUTES BEFORE SENDING AN UPDATE FOR THE THREE 
NORTHERNMOST COUNTIES REGARDING ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. 

MAIN FOCUS OF A WEAK S/W HAS PASSED INTO FCST AREA SO THE THREAT FOR 
MORE DEVELOPMENT SHOULD DIMINISH QUICKLY THIS AFTERNOON. OUTFLOW 
FROM FIRST STORM THAT POPPED IN WYANDOT/SENECA COUNTIES HAS CUT THE 
STORM OFF FROM THE WEAK SOUTERLY INFLOW, AND THE STORM HAS BACK 
BUILT INTO SENECA COUNTY FOR ANOTHER ROUND HERE. REMAINDER OF STORMS 
JUST N OF FCST AREA SHOULD EXHIBIT SAME BACK BUILDING, AS SFC SRLY 
INFLOW GETS CUT OFF. AM HEDGING THAT THIS WILL HAPPEN AND SITTING ON 
ANY UPDATE FOR ABOUT 20-30 MINUTES TO SEE IF THIS IS ACTUALLY THE 
CASE. 

IF I DO GO WITH AN UPDATE, IT WILL JUST BE FOR THOSE 3 COUNTIES AND 
TO MENTION ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE EARLY

SECOND IS OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE EXPECTED TO REACH THE LOWER 70S ALLOWING 
STRUCTURES TO RADIATE SOME AT NIGHT.  TDS WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED 
FRIDAY FOR POSSIBLE POOLING AHEAD OF DYING OUT COLD FRONT.

WILL BACK OFF ON POPS ACROSS THE NORTH TO ISOLATED FRIDAY EVENING FOR

PROGGED TO MOVE INTO ILN CWA ON FRIDAY.  MODELS DIFFER WITH AVN KEEPING 
FRONT MORE INTACT WHILE THE ETA WASHES IT OUT MORE.  BOTH MODELS BRING 
AXIS OF INSTABILITY INTO THE AREA DURING FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH LIMITED

JUST TICKLE THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA...AND 
EXPECT TSTM WATCHES WILL BE ISSUED FURTHER EAST INTO OH LATER THIS

AS PREFRNTL TROF MOVES EAST INTO VERY UNSTABLE AIR (CAPES 2000-3000 
J/KG) OVER OH VALLEY...WILL SEE TSTMS CONTINUE TO DVLP INTO THIS

MODERATE/TOWERING CU OVER SOUTHWEST OHIO INTO SOUTHERN INDIANA.  
THIS IS BEING SUPPORTED BY A FEW CONVECTIVE RADAR RETURNS FROM KILN

ON SATURDAY...PSEUDO WARM FRONT BEGINS TO SLOWLY PIVOT NE ACRS THE 
REGION.  A 40 PERCENT CHC OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS ALL LOCATIONS 
LOOKS GOOD ATTM.  TEMPS WILL BE A LITTLE TRICKY DEPENDING ON CLOUDS 
AND RAINFALL.  WILL STICK CLOSE TO MOS FOR THE SWRN CWFA (HIGHS 87 
TO 91) WITH GENERALLY UPPER 80S ELSEWHERE.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD SHIFT N AND E OF THE CWFA SATURDAY 
NIGHT...BRINGING AN END TO THE THREAT FOR PCPN.

ON SUNDAY...ETA IS MORE AMPLIFIED WITH A S/WV RIDGE WHILE AVN CONTS 
A MORE ZONAL FLOW PATTERN.  THEREFORE...ETA KEEPS REGION DRY WHILE 
AVN STILL SMEARS QPF ALL OVER THE PLACE.  WILL TAKE A BLEND OF 
SOLUTIONS AND GO A LOW CHC POP IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY FOR SUNDAY 
AFTN.  HAVE SIDED WITH WARMER MAV NUMBERS.

ANOTHER FRONT IS POISED TO MOVE INTO THE REGION DURING LATE MONDAY 
AFTN AND NIGHT.  THIS WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.

THE REST OF THE WEEK LOOKS DRY.  HOWEVER...AVN/MRF KEEP OSCILLATING 
ON WHETHER A SFC RIDGE WILL STAY IN PLACE OVER THE OHIO VLY.  WILL 
GO DRY FOR NOW...BUT I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF PCPN HAS TO BE 
INTRODUCED IN THE EXTENDED TOMORROW.

UPPER AIR PATTERN SHOWS A BROAD TROF OVER THE EASTERN CONUS...WITH A 
SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PART OF OUR CWA.  WITH MODELS 
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT...THE TROF WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE NEXT 
TWO DAYS.  ONLY MINOR 500 MB HEIGHT FALLS ARE PROGGED FOR OUR REGION.

FIRST SHORT WAVE IS TOUCHING OFF TSRA CURRENTLY IN OUR AREA...WITH A 
WELL-DEFINED MESOSCALE LOW ALONG SFC FRONT RESULTING IN TORRENTIAL 
RAIN OVER CENTRAL OHIO.  THE MESO LOW IS CURRENTLY SPINNING OUT OF 
OUR EASTERN COUNTIES.  DUE TO HEAVY RAIN ILN HAS ISSUED SEVERAL FLW 
IN CENTRAL OHIO THIS AFTERNOON. 

THOUGH THE MESO LOW IS MOVING OUT OF THE AREA...SHRA AND TSRA ARE 
STILL FORMING IN ITS WAKE ALONG THE FRONT.  THEREFORE ILL NEED TO 
KEEP AN EVENING CHANCE IN ALL ZONES EXCEPT WEST CENTRAL GROUP.
REST OF TONIGHT WILL FEATURE MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES EARLY...THEN 
PARTIAL CLEARING TOWARD MORNING.  

REST OF FCST PERIOD LOOKS TRANQUIL WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

GUIDANCE SUGGESTS NEAR AVERAGE TEMPS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS.  
WITH A LOT OF CLOUDS AROUND ILL STAY SLIGHTLY ABOVE FWC TONIGHT.  
FWC LOOKS ABOUT RIGHT FOR WEDNESDAY.  FWC LOOKS TOO COOL FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY SO ILL TREND UP TOWARD THE MAV.

EXTENDED:  NEXT MAJOR SHORT WAVE TO AFFECT THE REGION IS EXPECTED ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.  AFTER THAT...MODELS SHOW ANOTHER HOT 
SPELL WITH H5 RIDGE REBUILDING BY EARLY NEXT WEEK.  

.ILN...NONE.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER FA WITH 
COLD FRONT FROM WESTERN GREAT LAKES INTO IOWA.  SATELLITE IMAGERY 
INDICATES SOME LEFT OVER DEBRIS CLOUDS OVER NORTHERN FA.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING FRONT TO NEAR I-71 BY 12Z 
TUESDAY MORNING.  ALL BUT THE AVN PUSHES SOUTH OF FA BY AROUND 18Z.  
IT APPEARS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK OVER INDIANA TRIES TO HOLD UP THE 
FRONT.  WILL IGNORE THIS SOLUTION FOR THE MOMENT.  ETA SHOWS 
RESPECTABLE LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE/UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE COUPLET 
DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT OVER NW FA.  AS A RESULT WILL UP POPS NW OF 
I-71.  WILL ALSO MENTION POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN WITH PWS > 2 WITH 
TRAINING A POSSIBILITY (ESPECIALLY ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN HALF 
OF FA).  WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY OVER SOUTHERN FA FOR TUESDAY 
MORNING...THEN WILL CUT BACK TO CHANCE POPS.

FOR THIS AFTERNOON WILL ADD ISOLATED TRW ACROSS NORTHERN FA.  
INSTABILITY REACHES 2000 TO 3000 J/KG WITH MODELS PICKING UP ON SOME 
WEAK LIFT.  THIS WAS ENOUGH TO SPAWN ISOLATED COVERAGE YESTERDAY 
ACROSS NORTHERN FA.  WILL ADD IN STRONG WORDING THIS AFTERNOON AND 
TONIGHT ACROSS THE NW HALF OF FA.  SPC HAS MOST OF FA IN SLIGHT 
RISK.  WET BULB ZERO WILL BE BETWEEN 10 AND 11 KFT...CAPE WILL BE 
1500 TO 2000 J/KG.  THINK WIND DAMAGE WILL BE THE GREATEST THREAT 
WITH STORMS PULSING/MERGING ALONG SQUALL LINE WHICH WILL MOVE 
THROUGH OVERNIGHT.  WITH TIMING AFTER DARK WILL MENTION STRONG 
STORMS INSTEAD OF SEVERE.  WILL ISSUE SPS.

WILL KEEP HEAT ADVISORY AND WARNINGS FOR FA.  HEAT INDICES WILL BE 
A BIT WARMER THAN YESTERDAY WITH TDS/RH BEING A BIT HIGHER AND 
TEMPERATURES SIMILAR

UPPER RIDGE OVER EASTERN CONUS IS BREAKING DOWN AS A TROF APPROACHES 
FROM THE UPPER PLAINS.  TROF AXIS IS PROGGED TO BISECT OUR CWA ON 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON.  MODELS ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO 
THE TROFS POSITION...THOUGH THE AVN IS MORE AMPLIFIED.

AT THE SFC...A COLD FRONT SITUATED NEAR PIA IS PROGGED BY THE AVN 
AND ETA TO BE FROM AROUND CMH TO DAY AT 12Z TUESDAY...THEN TO THE 
OHIO RIVER BY 18Z.  BOTH MODELS DEVELOP A WAVE IN KENTUCKY ALONG THE 
FRONT WHICH WILL LIKELY HOLD UP THE FRONTS PROGRESS LATER ON 
TUESDAY.

RADAR SHOWS SCT TSRA IN ILN CWA.  WITH THE FRONT STILL OFF TO THE 
WEST...I EXPECT THIS PREFRONTAL ACTIVITY WILL FADE A BIT AS THE SUN 
LOWERS.  THE TSRA WILL REFIRE LATE TONIGHT AS THE FRONT ENTERS THE 
AREA.  GENEROUS AMOUNTS OF INSTABILITY AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT WILL CONTRIBUTE TO THE CHANCE FOR SEVERE TSRA...THOUGH 
SYNOPTIC SCALE WIND FIELDS WILL BE WEAK.  WEAK FLOW AND PWAT 
APPROACHING 2 WILL ADD FLOODING THREAT...THOUGH PARCHED GROUND WILL 
HELP REDUCE THE POSSIBILITY FOR WIDESPREAD PROBLEMS.  

ILL CONTINUE PREVIOUS FCSTS TREND AND GO WITH STRONG TSRA LIKELY 
TONIGHT...MAINLY LATE.  WITH THE FRONT HOLDING UP MORE THAN EXPECTED 
ON TUESDAY...ILL TAKE OUT THROUGH NOON TIMING IN CVG GROUP...AND 
EXTEND CHANCE THROUGH NOON AT DAY AND CMH. FOR THE SOUTH CENTRAL 
GROUP...ILL CONTINUE PREVIOUS FCST TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...AND ILL 
ADD CHANCE TSRA TUESDAY NIGHT UNTIL MIDNIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE AND 
DRIER AIR WILL BRING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ON WEDNESDAY.

TEMPS:  GUIDANCE HAS INCREASED SINCE PREVIOUS RUN.  THIS SEEMS 
REASONABLE WITH TEMPS IN THE MID 80S TODAY BEHIND THE FRONT.  
THEREFORE IVE RAISED TUESDAYS AND WEDNESDAYS TEMPS A CAT FROM 
LAST FORECAST.  TUESDAY NIGHTS LOWS NEED RAISING AS WELL...THOUGH 
IT WILL COOL INTO THE LOW TO MID 60S.

EXTENDED:  RAISED TEMPS IN THE EXTENDED AS WELL...THOUGH WEAKER 
UPPER RIDGE INDICATES THAT IT WILL NOT BE QUITE AS HOT AS IN RECENT 
DAYS.  NO MAJOR SYSTEMS ARE IN THE OFFING...THOUGH A DISTURBANCE 
WILL BRING A CHANCE OF TSRA ON FRIDAY.  WITH NO SIGNIFICANT UPPER 
SUPPORT OR SFC CONVERGENCE EXPECTED...REST OF EXTENDED HAS PARTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES.

EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING/HEAT ADVISORY WILL BE CONTINUED UNTIL 
MIDNIGHT...AFTER WHICH TEMPS AND HEAT INDICES WILL FALL BELOW 
CRITICAL LEVELS.

BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER MID/UPPER MS VLY.  SATELLITE IMAGERY 
INDICATES MAINLY CLEAR SKIES WITH SOME CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS 
WORKING INTO FA FROM THE WEST. 

INTERESTING FORECAST.  MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT UNTIL THROUGH 
36 TO 48 HOURS THEN BEGIN TO DIVERGE.  THE ETA/NGM ARE THE SLOWEST 
WITH BRINGING NEXT FRONT INTO FA WHILE THE AVN/UKMET AND EUROPEAN 
(7-20 12Z) ARE ABOUT 6 TO 12 HOURS FASTER.  WILL GO WITH A 
COMPROMISE FOR FORECAST SINCE THERE APPEARS TO BE NO DEFINITIVE 
ANSWER.  AS A RESULT WILL UP POPS IN THE NORTHWEST MONDAY NIGHT AND 
GET RID OF TIMING.  WILL ALSO INTRODUCE POPS LATE IN THE SOUTHEAST.

NEXT CONCERN IS THE HEAT.  UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN TODAY AND REMAINS 
AROUND UNTIL FROPA.  THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO CLIMB INTO THE LOWER 
TO MIDDLE 90S TODAY AND MONDAY.  TDS WILL BE IN THE 70S.  THIS WILL

BOUNDARY WILL STALL IN SOUTHERN PART OF FORECAST AREA BUT BE VERY 
WEAK. SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR WILL FILTER IN FROM THE NORTH. CANNOT RULE 
OUT SOME PRECIPITATION FORMING NEAR THE OHIO RIVER ON SATURDAY BUT 
BELIEVE CHANCE IS TOO LOW TO MENTION IN THE FORECAST. ANY VESTIGE OF 
THE FRONT SHOULD LIFT NORTH OF THE AREA ON SUNDAY.

NEXT FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTH ON TUESDAY. 
GENERALLY PREFERRED SOLUTION SUGGESTED BY ECMWF WHICH IS SLOWER WITH

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OUT AHEAD OF A 
SLOWLY MOVING MID LEVEL DISTURBANCE. EXPECT COVERAGE TO DECREASE 
SOMEWHAT WITH LOSS OF HEATING. BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE 
SOME CONVECTION CONTINUE OVERNIGHT AS THIS SLOWLY MOVES ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. LOOKS LIKE THE BETTER COVERAGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ZONES.

MODELS AGREE IN KEEPING DEEP MOISTURE ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS. SO IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO RULE OUT SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AT ANY TIME WITH A LITTLE SUPPORT FROM WEAK UPPER 
LEVEL IMPULSES. BUT WITH NO SIGNIFICANT FEATURES APPARENT WILL JUST 
KEEP A LOW CHANCE FOR TOMORROW AND TOMORROW NIGHT. EXPECT THE CHANCE 
OF RAIN TO BE A LITTLE BETTER GOING INTO FRIDAY AS A WEAK FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH. 

THIS BOUNDARY WILL BE SLOW MOVING AND MAY NEVER MAKE IT THROUGH THE 
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA BEFORE LIFTING BACK NORTH LATE IN THE WEEKEND. 
HOWEVER EXPECT IT TO WEAKEN EVEN FURTHER AS SUGGESTED BY ETA. THIS 
COULD STILL TRIGGER A FEW STORMS BUT BY SUNDAY BELIEVE THE CHANCE IS 
BELOW THRESHOLD FOR MENTION IN THE FORECAST.

WITH DEEPER MOISTURE AROUND EXPECT MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES TO BE NOT 
QUITE AS HIGH AS THE PAST FEW DAYS. HOWEVER OVERNIGHT LOWS 
SHOULD BE ABOVE NORMAL.

PERSISTENT BUT WEAK H5 TROF CONTINUES TO HANG OVER MISSOURI THROUGH

A SECOND S/W IS RIGHT ON THE TAIL OF THE FIRST ONE, BUT IS 
SIGNIFICANTLY WEAKER AND PLACED SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER. HOWEVER, 
THE RIDGE HASNT HAD A CHANCE TO RECOVER FROM THE FIRST S/W AND 
LINGERING MOISTURE TO THE SOUTH OF FCST AREA MIGHT PLAY IN TO SOME

LOOKING AT THE ETA FOR THE SAME TIME FRAME, IT DOESNT SUPPORT THE

CLOSER TO THE LOW OVER MO. IT STRETCHES OUT THE VORT ALONG-JUST 
SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER LATER ON WEDNESDAY AND KEEPS THE AXIS HERE

SOUTHWEST AND LEAVE REMAINDER OF FCST DRY. WEDNESDAY NIGHT 40 POPS 
SHOULD BE CUT OUT OF THE NORTH AND EVEN IN THE SOUTH, A 30 IS

SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN MODEL RUNS OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. NOT MUCH TO 
GO OFF OF WITH A WEAK H5 TROF OVER THE MIDWEST, WHICH SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO HAMPER ANY SIGNIFICANT WEATHER FEATURE OVER THE OHVLY. 

MAIN PROBLEM WITH FCST WILL BE POPS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AND 
EVENINGS. NO REAL FORCING TO KEY ON, SO I DONT THINK THAT THERES 
GOING TO BE MUCH IN THE WAY OF OVERNIGHT CONVECTION. ANY RAIN THIS 
AFTERNOON LOOKS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH H5 VORT MOVING INTO THE REGION 
FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. AFTER INITIAL SHOT OF RAIN LATE TODAY, 
VORT STRETCHES OUT SOUTH OF THE OHIO AND JUST HANGS AROUND FOR A FEW 
DAYS. SFC FRONT SLOWLY MOVES SOUTH FROM GTLKS RGN STARTING THURS PM 
AND TAKES UNTIL FRIDAY OVERNIGHT TO GET SOUTH OF FCST AREA PER AVN 
SOLUTION. ETA DOESNT BRING IN THE STRONG HIGH PRESSURE TO FORCE THE 
FRONT SOUTH, AND THIS LOOKS TO BE A BETTER SOLUTION TO ME. HOWEVER, 
THIS WOULD KEEP AT LEAST CHANCE POPS IN THROUGH THIS PERIOD. I HATE 
TO KEEP SAYING CHANCE OF RAIN ESPECIALLY SINCE WERE NOT IN A WET 
PATTERN, BUT I JUST CANT RULE OUT SCATTERED SHOWERS.

TEMPS IN THE WEST ARE ALSO GOING TO BE A PROBLEM TODAY WITH SLIGHTLY 
COOLER H8 AIR AND CLOUD COVER. THE EAST SHOULD REACH AGAIN INTO THE 
LOW 90S WITH A NICE SHOT OF SUNSHINE TODAY. H8 TEMPS REMAIN IN THE 
16 TO 18 DEGREE RANGE THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST WHICH 
WILL RESULT IN DAYTIME HIGHS DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER AND OVERNIGHT 
LOWS AROUND THE 70 DEGREE MARK.

FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH FCST AREA TONIGHT, WITH A RELATIVELY COOL 
AIRMASS ABOUT 18 HOURS BEHIND IT. H8 TEMPS AT 12Z THURSDAY ARE 
RANGING FROM 15 OVER THE SW TO 11 IN THE NE. THIS WOULD BE 
ASSOCIATED WITH A CORRESPONDING WED NIGHT TEMPERATURE IN THE 50S. 
MODELS HAVENT BEEN THIS COOL IN QUITE SOME TIME, AND THIS IS ABOUT 
7-8 DEGREES LESS THAN THIS RUN YESTERDAY. AM CONCERNED THAT THERE 
MAY BE TOO MUCH WIND OVERNIGHT TO GET THIS COLD...BUT COLD AIR SINKS 
AND THERES A GOOD 25-30KT JETLET AT 925 MB TO BRING IN THE CAA. 
LOOKING AT THE LOW AND MID LEVEL RH, THERE SHOULDNT BE MUCH TO 
HAMPER THE COLD AIR WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE FAR SOUTH. 
WILL STAY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPS, POSSIBLY A LITTLE WARMER IN 
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF FCST AREA. 

AREA OF SUBSIDENCE AFTER INITIAL SHOT OF RAIN IS KILLING THE SHOWERS 
THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER, THIS WONT LAST THAT LONG AND I DO EXPECT 
SOME DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE FRONT TONIGHT BUT HAVENT DECIDED HOW 
MUCH. RIGHT NOW IM GOING TO GO WITH SCATTERED OR CHANCE WORDING AND 
TRY TO ADD A LITTLE TIMING. NE FLOW ON WED SHOULD HELP FOR A NICE 
DAY WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 80S, CLOSE TO GUIDANCE. 

ON THE EXTENDED...
IT STILL LOOKS LIKE AN UNSETTLED/UNRESOLVED PATTERN OVER OHVLY. A 
NUMBER OF MODELS ARE COMING IN WITH DIFFERENT AND YET PLAUSIBLE 
SOLUTIONS. SPAGHETTI PLOTS AT H5 ARE SHOWING A WIDE VARIANCE OVER 
THE REGION ON THE EXTENDED SO A COUPLE OF DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS STILL 
SEEM POSSIBLE.

GENERALLY, H5 TROF IS EXPECTED OVER FCST AREA FROM THE GTLKS TO 
ARKLATX REGIONS. YESTERDAYS FCST SETTLED ON A MORE PRONOUNCED H5 
LOW DROPPING FROM MO TO LA ON FRI AND SAT, BUT NEW RUNS SEEM TO BE 
SHOWING MORE ENERGY APPROACHING FCST AREA AND REMOVING IT FROM THIS 
REGION. THIS WOULD ALSO ENHANCE THE SFC FRONT AND INVERTED TROF 
PROGGED TO BE STRETCHED FROM SDF TO DAY AND ENCHANCE THE THREAT FOR 
RAIN, ESPECIALLY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. 

AM NOT POSITIVE ON WHICH WILL ACTUALLY PAN OUT, BUT CURRENT FCST HAS 
POPS OVER THE REGION DURING THIS TIME FRAME AND IM GOING TO 
CONTINUE THE TREND. 

THE SFC FRONT CONNECTED WITH THE LOW OVER CANADA DOESNT SEEM TO BE 
AS PRONOUNCED ON THIS MODEL RUN, BUT IT DOES AMPLIFY THE LOW COMING 
FROM THE MS VLY TOWARDS THE OHVLY. IN OTHER WORDS, SAME FORECAST FOR 
DIFFERENT CAUSES. EXPECT TO KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S DURING THE 
DAY AND IN THE UPPER 50S TO 60S AT NIGHT, WITH THE THOUGHT THAT 
AIRMASS WILL START A LITTLE COOLER THAN EXPECTED. DONT EXPECT TO 
PUT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S LIKE I DID YESTERDAY - LOW AND MID 80S

THANKS TO CLE FOR COORD.

MAIN FORECAST CONCERN TODAY WILL BE TIMING OF FRONT ON TUESDAY AND 
THE NEXT CHANCE FOR PRECIP IN THE EXTENDED. 

IN THE SHORT TERM, MODELS LOOK TO BE UNIFORM ON A SOLUTION WITH A 
COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH FCST AREA DURING THE DAY TUES FROM NW-SE. 
AM NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING BUT A LINGERING SHOWER IN THE SOUTHEAST ON 
WEDNESDAY. A NICER AIRMASS SHOULD BE IN PLACE OVER US AND MAKE THE 
LOWER 80S FEEL QUITE COMFORTABLE FOR A DAY OR TWO. WILL WORD PRECIP 
ON TUESDAY AS LIKELY WITH 70 POPS, POSSIBLY BEGINNING LATE TONIGHT 
IN THE NORTHWEST WITH CHANCE POPS. 

AS FOR TEMPERATURES, WILL NOT STRAY MORE THAN A DEGREE OR TWO FROM 
GUIDANCE ACROSS THE SHORT TERM AS ALL OF THE NUMBERS APPEAR TO 
CONVERGE ON THE SAME SOLUTIONS. IN THE EXTENDED, GUIDANCE IS WELL 
TOO COOL, AND HAVE CONTINUED THE TREND FROM PREVIOUS FORECASTS AND 
KEPT HIGHS IN THE 80S AND LOWS IN THE 60S.

FOR THE EXTENDED, MODELS ARE IN A BIT OF DISAGREEMENT ON WHAT TO DO 
WITH THE H5 DISTURBANCE THAT COMES OFF OF THE PACIFIC AND RIDES OVER 
THE WESTERN RIDGE. MODELS ARE CONSISTENT THAT IT WILL DROP FROM 
NODAK INTO THE MIDWEST...BUT AFTER THIS THEY DIVERGE. SPAGHETTI 
PLOTS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE MIDWEST FROM DAYS 4 THROUGH 7. 
MRF SEEMS TO FAVOR THE MOST EASTWARD SOLUTION, AND IM A LITTLE 
CONCERNED ABOUT USING THIS AS THE MODEL OF CHOICE SINCE THE UKMET, 
ECMWF, AND CANADIAN ALL HAVE A TRACK OF THIS FEATURE THATS 
SIGNIFICANTLY FURTHER WEST. INSTEAD OF THE MRF SOLUTION WITH THE H5 
TRACKING FROM IL AT 12Z FRIDAY TO CVG AT 12Z SATURDAY, OTHER MODELS 
INDICATE THAT IT WILL TAKE A MORE SOUTHERLY ROUTE AND REMAIN WEST OF 
OHIO VALLEY. SINCE MOST OF THE MODELS HAVE TRACKED MORE SOUTH AND 
WEST...WILL FAVOR A BLEND OF THESE AND EXPECT THE FEATURE TO BE 
SOMEWHERE OVER MO AT 12Z FRI AND THEN MOVE TO ARK/LA AT 12Z SAT. 
THIS BLENDS WELL WITH THE NEW 84 HOUR RUN OF THE ETA.

THOUGH THIS WILL CUT THE CHANCES OF PRECIP IN SRN FCST AREA ON 
FRIDAY...WILL STILL EXPECT A CHANCE OF SCT CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE 
SFC FRONT ON SAT. BETTER CHANCES OF PRECIP ARE EXPECTED SUNDAY, 
EXITING BY SUNDAY NIGHT WITH MONDAY BEING DRIER AND COOLER. WILL 
WORD AS A CHANCE OF SHOWERS SATURDAY AND SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. 

EXPECT MISILN OUT AROUND 3:00

MODEL SOLUTIONS LOOK A LITTLE QUICKER THAN EARLIER RUNS BOTH WITH 
THE SYSTEM ON TUESDAY AND THE NEXT SHORT WAVE TOWARDS THE END OF THE 
WEEK. BUT FIRST FOR TODAY AVIATION MODEL CONTINUES TO SUGGEST 
BETTER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND SOME WEAK CONVERGENCE SPREADING INTO 
SOUTHERN OHIO TODAY WHILE ETA AND NESTED GRID REMAIN FURTHER SOUTH. 
BASED ON LATEST OBSERVATIONS IT LOOKS LIKE THE AVIATION IS STARTING 
OUT TOO FAR NORTH. SO WILL SIDE WITH OTHER SOLUTIONS AND KEEP OUT 
ANY MENTION OF PRECIPITATION FOR TODAY. COULD BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
HIGH CLOUDS SPREADING SOUTHWARD FROM CONVECTION IN THE WESTERN GREAT 
LAKES BUT BELIEVE THAT TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL RISE TO AROUND 90 
AREAWIDE.

WITH THE SYSTEM COMING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES NOW TRENDING FASTER 
WILL INTRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE TONIGHT 
FOR NORTHWEST ZONES. THIS SHOULD SPREAD FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. WILL STICK WITH HIGH 
CHANCE PROBABILITIES. BASED ON EXPECTED MOVEMENT WILL ALSO BE ABLE 
TO END THE CHANCE OF RAIN A LITTLE SOONER ON TUESDAY NIGHT. NOT A 
LOT OF DIFFERENCE IN FWC AND MAV TEMPERATURES AND SEE LITTLE REASON 
TO VARY MORE THAN A FEW DEGREES FROM THEM.

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTH WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THE 
SUBSEQUENT SHORT WAVE IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW IS MUCH FURTHER SOUTH BY 
FRIDAY MORNING THAN THE PREVIOUS AVIATION SOLUTION. THIS MAY CAUSE 
AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH TO DEVELOP INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. MOISTURE 
MAY BE LIMITED BUT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY IN 
THE SOUTHERN ZONES STILL LOOKS REASONABLE.

WITH HIGH AMPLITUDE PATTERN MODELS ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT. 
DEEP UPPER TROUGH TO DEVELOP IN NEW ENGLAND WILL PUSH RIDGE TO THE 
WEST AND PUT REGION INTO NORTHERLY FLOW. RIDGE THEN RETROGRADES 
FURTHER WEST IN THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. SO FLOW WILL BACK TO THE 
NORTHWEST AND ALLOW SHORT WAVE ENERGY TO MOVE THROUGH THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION.

BUT IN THE SHORT TERM EAST-WEST ORIENTED FRONT IS MAKING SLOW 
PROGRESS SOUTHWARD AND EXPECT IT SHOULD BE NEAR THE OHIO RIVER BY 
12Z. DRIER AND COOLER AIR IS LAGGING BEHIND THIS BOUNDARY SO BELIEVE 
THAT TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL GET INTO THE UPPER 80S ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN ZONES. COULD SEE SOME EARLY CLOUD DEVELOPMENT THERE BUT 
ANYTHING THAT DOES FORM SHOULD DIMINISH BY AFTERNOON AS DRIER AIR 
CONTINUES TO MOVE IN.

SURFACE HIGH WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. IT 
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR BETTER MOISTURE TO RETURN ONCE 
IT MOVES OFF TO THE EAST. SO WILL HOLD OFF ON THE NEXT CHANCE OF

INTO CNTRL MI...THEN INTO SRN WI AND INTO NRN IA.

AVN AND ETA IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC FEATURES OVER THE 
NEXT 24 HOURS.  HOWEVER...THERE ARE SOME MESOSCALE FEEDBACK ISSUES 
WITH THE MESOETA.

WATER VAPOR AND MODELS DEPICTED A WEAKENING H5 S/WV OVER THE ERN 
GREAT LAKES FROM LAKE ONTARIO SW INTO SRN MICHIGAN.  THIS 
S/WV...COMBINED WITH A WEAK LOW LEVEL JET...HAS CAUSED A CLUSTER OF 
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OVER SRN MICHIGAN.  S/WV IS FCST TO SLOWLY 
MOVE SOUTHEAST DURING THE MORNING HOURS AND STRETCH WITH TIME.  WITH 
S/WV OUT RUNNING SFC FRONT AND LOW LVL FORCING BECOMING NILL BY 
MORNING...S/WV SHOULD NOT CAUSE MUCH AS IT CROSSES THE CWFA LATE 
MORNING INTO NOON.  MEANWHILE...SFC COLD FRONT WILL AT FIRST MOVE 
SLOWLY SOUTHEAST THROUGH TODAY AS H5 TO H25 FLOW VERY WEAK (25 TO 30 
KT).  THE COLD FRONT IS FCST TO BE NEAR AN KERI TO KTOL TO KSBN LINE 
BY 18Z (2 PM)...AN TO A KPHD TO KMIE LINE BY 00Z.  THE FRONT SHOULD 
THEN SHOULD BEGIN TO ACCELERATE AS JET ENERGY DIGS INTO H5 LOW OVER 
SE CANADA/NEW ENGLAND...GIVE THE FRONT MORE OF A PUSH.  AS A 
RESULT...EXPECT THE FRONT TO BE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE ENTIRE CWFA 
BY 12Z SAT (FROM NRN VA...SRN W VA...CNTRL KY).  UPR DIV ASSOCD WITH 
FRONT IS BASICALLY NILL...SO THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL ONLY BE 
DRIVEN BY SHALLOW LOW LVL CONV WITH THE FRONT.  THEREFORE...HIGHEST 
POPS WILL BE PLACED IN THE FAR NRN CWFA THIS AFTN (30 PERCENT).  
BELIEVE REMAINDER OF CWFA WILL ONLY HAVE A SLIGHT CHC OF A POP UP 
SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM DURING THE HEAT OF THE DAY GIVEN LACK OF 
DYNAMICS AND FOCUSED LOW LVL FORCING.  WILL DISCOUNT THE CONVECTIVE 
BLOW UP OF THE ETA OVER CNTRL OHIO FROM 15Z TO 18Z...WHICH ENDS UP

YESTERDAY.  WILL MENTION HOT AND HUMID WORDING IN THE ZONES FOR 
TODAY.  TEMPS A LITTLE TRICKY GIVEN THAT SOME MORE CUMULUS 
DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED TODAY...BUT WILL STICK PRETTY CLOSE TO MOS 
GUIDANCE.

AS FRONT PUSHES SOUTH THROUGH THE REGION THIS EVENING...ANY 
THUNDERSTORM (SLIGHT AT BEST) ACTIVITY SHOULD DIE OUT AFTER SUNSET 
SINCE THERE WILL BE A LACK OF SIGNIFICANT FORCING.

DRIER AND A LITTLE COOLER WEATHER IS EXPECTED FOR FRIDAY.  THERE 
WILL BE A SHARP CONTRAST IN TEMPS FROM NE TO SW AS EVIDENT OF THE 
850 MB TEMPS.  EXPECTED HIGHS TO RANGE FROM 83/84 IN THE N AND E TO

07Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED SFC HIGH PRESSURE OVER CNTRL IL.  A COLD 
FRONT WAS LOCATED OVER SRN/ERN MN...EXTENDING SW INTO SD AND NE.

MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC FEATURES FOR THE 
NEXT THREE DAYS.  UPR LVL FLOW PATTERN ACRS THE SRN CANADIAN 
PROVINCES WILL TRANSITION FROM A ZONAL FLOW TO A MORE AMPLIFIED FLOW 
PATTERN (DUE TO UPR LOW PUSHING INTO BRITISH COLUMBIA).  AS A 
RESULT...COLD FRONT OVER THE UPR MS VLY WILL SLOWLY PUSH TO THE 
SOUTH AND EAST TOWARD OUR CWFA.  THIS ALSO MEANS THAT UPR LVL 
RIDGE...CENTERED NEAR NW OHIO ATTM...WILL FLATTEN AND PUSH TOWARD 
THE WEST. 

FOR TODAY...AIRMASS SHOULD REMAIN SOMEWHAT DRY AS IT WAS 
YESTERDAY.  ONLY SCT CUMULUS CLOUDS DEVELOPED YESTERDAY AS THE 
REGION REMAINED UNDER A LOW RH MINIMUM AT 850 MB COUPLED WITH LOWER 
TO MID 60S DEWPOINTS.  THIS SHOULD BE SIMILAR TODAY...SO WILL FCST 
MOSTLY SUNNY.  TEMPS ONCE AGAIN WILL PUSH INTO THE LOWER AND MID 90S 
AS 1000-850 MB THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS SUPPORT THIS.  EXACT 
TEMPS TODAY WILL DEPEND ON WHERE THE 19 OR 20 DEGREE C ISOTHERMS SET 
UP ALONG WITH ELEVATION AND URBAN EFFECTS.  WILL FORECAST A RANGE OF 
92 TO 96 IN THE ZONES DUE TO THE MENTIONED PARAMETERS.  WITH 
DEWPOINTS 
REMAINING IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S...HEAT INDICES WILL ONLY BE IN THE 
MID TO UPPER 90S...SO A HEAT ADVISORY WILL NOT BE ISSUED.

FOR TONIGHT...ANY CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT SHOULD DISSIPATE AFTER 
SUNSET...GIVING WAY TO MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS.

ON THURSDAY...AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT IS FCST TO BE FROM A WRN 
NY...SRN ONTARIO...SRN MICHIGAN LINE BY 12Z.  THE FRONT WILL 
SLOWLY PUSH SOUTH AND WEST...BEING LOCATED FROM ABOUT THE QUAD 
CITIES TO IND...TO DAY TO CMH TO A PIT LINE BETWEEN 00Z AND 01Z FRI 
(THURSDAY EVENING).  UPR LVL DYNAMICS WILL BE LACKING AS JET ENERGY

THUS...THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL BE DRIVE FROM SHALLOW LOW LVL 
CONVERGENCE (SFC THROUGH 925 MB).  CURRENT FCST FOR AFTN 
THUNDERSTORMS (30 POP) LOOKS GOOD ATTM.  THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD 
GRADUALLY DISSIPATE THURSDAY NIGHT (WITH LOSS OF DAY TIME HEATING) 
AS COLD FRONT CONTINUES ON ITS TREK SOUTH AND WEST.

CONTS TO PUMP HIGH PWS INTO THE OHIO VLY.

MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH SFC SYNOPTIC FEATURES...BUT

NOT TOO MUCH CHANGING IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. SW-NE ORIENTED H5 RIDGE 
OVER FCST AREA EXTENDS ALMOST TO THE SFC THROUGH 60 HRS AS IT 
BECOMES W-E ORIENTED DUE TO H5 CUTOFF ENTERING THE GULF STATES. 
MODELS ARE TOUCHING ON SOME WEAK CONVERGENCE TO THE NORTH AND 
CREATING DIURNAL CONVECTION ON FRIDAY...MAINLY IN THE NORTHWEST FCST 
AREA. THIS IS TOUCHED ON IN CURRENT FCST PACKAGE AND I DONT EXPECT 
TO CHANGE IT, EXCEPT FOR DROPPING FROM 30 POPS TO SILENT 20S IN CMH 
AND DAY GROUPINGS. AVN IS ALL OVER THE BOARD WITH CREATING SOME QPF 
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS DUE TO A WEAK CONVERGENT BOUNDARY IN THE LOW 
LEVELS. AM TRENDING TOWARDS THE ETA AND OPTIMISM AND KEEPING A DRY 
FORECAST FOR SATURDAY SINCE I CANT FIND A TRIGGER. ANY UPPER LEVEL 
SUPPORT WILL REMAIN WELL N OF FCST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 

NEXT SHOT OF PRECIP LOOKS TO COME FROM H5 LOW TO THE SOUTH AS IT 
ADVECTS ATLANTIC MOISTURE INTO SRN FCST AREA ON SUNDAY. QPF PATTERN 
BECOMES CORRUPTED FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK UNDER A WEAK FLOW 
REGIME WITH INCREASED MOISTURE BUT LITTLE SUPPORT.

ON TEMPS, I DONT EXPECT TO STRAY FAR FROM GUIDANCE WITH HIGHS IN 
THE MID TO UPPER 80S (MAYBE A 90 OR TWO) AND LOWS IN THE MID TO 
UPPER 60S. THIS PATTERN PERSISTS THROUGH THE ENTIRE FORECAST.

FOR THE EXTENDED...SPAGHETTI PLOTS ARE IN FAIR AGREEMENT ACROSS THE 
BOARD WITH SOME MINOR DIFFERENCES OVER THE GREAT LAKES. MRF, ECMWF, 
CANADIAN AND UKMET ARE QUITE SIMILAR AT 144 HOURS AND WILL USE THE 
MRF AS A BASE FOR THE FORECAST AFTER DAY 3. MEAN H5 CUTOFF FROM 
TROPICAL INFLUENCE MEANDERS OVER THE GULF STATES AS H5 HIGH BUILDS 
OVER THE SOUTHWEST. ENERGY FROM GULF LOW SLOWLY GETS ENTRAINED INTO 
THE ZONAL FLOW OVER THE GTLKS REGION BY THE END OF THE FCST.

NEXT WEEK THE MRF HAS A PRONOUNCED SFC RIDGE OVER LOWER OHVLY SUNDAY 
AND KEEPS IT QUASI-STATIONARY TO THE SOUTH OVER THE CAROLINAS AND TN 
VLY. THIS PAINTS SOME QPF OVER FCST AREA, BUT RIGHT NOW IM INCLINED

LITTLE OVERDONE AND EXPECT TO SHAVE A BIT HERE...ESPECIALLY FOR THE 
NORTH HALF OF FCST AREA. WITH THE APPROACH OF THE H5 LOW...SFC 
SYSTEM STRENGTHENS AND SLOWS SLIGHTLY WITH A NORTHWARD PROGRESSION. 
DRY AIR MOVES IN AT THE MID LEVELS TONIGHT AND NOTICEABLY CUTS OFF

ILL WILL CONTINUE TO DROP SE INTO CVG AREA THIS MORNING...BUT WILL 
EXPECT IT TO LOSE STRENGTH AND HAVE THE POSSIBILITY COVERED BY

VARYING MODEL SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO MAKE FOR A CHALLENGING FORECAST. 
AVIATION SEEMS TO HAVE THE MOST TROUBLE YET AGAIN WITH CONVECTIVE 
FEEDBACK OVERDEVELOPING SYSTEMS. PREFER TO LEAN TOWARDS THE MORE 
REALISTIC LOOKING ETA. BUT EVEN WITH THAT DO NOT HAVE A LOT OF 
CONFIDENCE.

LATEST SURFACE MAP SHOWS THAT FRONT APPEARS TO EXTEND FROM LAKE ERIE 
ACROSS FAR SOUTHERN MICHIGAN. THIS BOUNDARY SHOULD SAG SOUTHWARD 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT BUT PROBABLY NOT AS FAR AS THE OHIO 
RIVER. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD CONTINUE TO OCCUR 
AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE. EXPECT COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
TO INCREASE LATE TONIGHT NEAR THE BOUNDARY AS A SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS 
AND APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. HOWEVER THERE WILL PROBABLY BE A 
RATHER SHARP CUTOFF TO THE NORTHERN EDGE OF PRECIPITATION AS DRIER 
AIR TRIES TO WORK IN FROM THE NORTH BEHIND THE FRONT.

THIS WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS SURFACE LOW MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA TOMORROW. THERE SHOULD BE FAIRLY GOOD COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE LOW. BUT THIS SHOULD DIMINISH DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AS A DRY SLOT MOVES IN BEHIND THE LOW. SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS MAY LINGER INTO THE EVENING IN THE EASTERN ZONES. THEN 
MODELS SUGGEST THAT WEATHER SHOULD BE QUIET AS DRY AIR CONTINUES TO 
WRAP IN FROM THE WEST. STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE COULD BE SOME 
INSTABILITY SHOWERS ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS UPPER LOW MOVES INTO THE 
WESTERN GREAT LAKES.

FORECAST BECOMES EVEN MORE UNCERTAIN FROM SATURDAY ON. LATEST 
AVIATION MODEL RUN IS NOT NEARLY AS AMPLIFIED AS THE 00Z RUN. FOR 
NOW WILL KEEP SATURDAY AND SUNDAY DRY AS FIRST SHORT WAVE MOVES OFF 
TO THE EAST. BUT MORE ENERGY WILL BE DROPPING INTO THE MEAN TROUGH 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. WOULD BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW DIFFERENT THE 12Z 
RUN IS FROM THE 00Z RUN BEYOND 120 HOURS CONSIDERING THE DIFFERENCES 
UP TO THAT FORECAST TIME. WILL RELY ON HPC GUIDANCE AND HAVE A 
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION FROM MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

CONVECTIVE LINE SLOWLY MOVING ACROSS INDIANA THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
SHOULD MAKE IT INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING ALTHOUGH CONTINUE 
TO WEAKEN. HOWEVER IT APPEARS THAT ADDITIONAL CONVECTION FURTHER OUT 
TO THE WEST SHOULD SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION OVERNIGHT AS A SHORT 
WAVE PASSES BY TO THE NORTH. EXPECT THAT BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE 
IN NORTHERN ZONES OVERNIGHT. 

PRECIPITATION MAY BE ONGOING EARLY IN THE MORNING AND THEN DIMINISH 
AS UPPER SUPPORT MOVES OFF. SO THERE SHOULD BE LESS AREAL COVERAGE 
AS THE DAY GOES ON. COULD SEE SOME REDEVELOPMENT IN THE AFTERNOON AS 
INSTABILITY IS FORECAST TO INCREASE AND A COLD FRONT WILL BE SAGGING 
INTO THE ZONES. GIVEN FORECAST SOUNDINGS COULD SEE SOME HEAVY 
RAINFALL ESPECIALLY TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING AS MOISTURE WILL 
BE PLENTIFUL AND THE FLOW WILL BE ALIGNED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF 
TRAINING ECHOES.

WITH THE LOSS OF HEATING WEDNESDAY EVENING THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DIMINISH ALTHOUGH SOME ACTIVITY COULD LINGER IN 
THE SOUTH CENTRAL ZONES.

MODELS HAVE INCREASING SPREAD IN THEIR SOLUTIONS WITH TIME. AVIATION 
CERTAINLY HAS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK IN BRINGING A STRONG SHORT WAVE 
ACROSS THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY MORNING...IN ADDITION TO 
FEEDBACK WITH THE SHORT WAVE THAT WILL BE MOVING ACROSS TONIGHT. ETA 
MAY ALSO BE OVERDEVELOPING THE SHORT WAVE IT BRINGS ACROSS ON 
THURSDAY. SO NOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN MODEL SOLUTIONS. WILL GO 
ALONG WITH THE IDEA OF THE ETA IN LIFTING THE FRONT BACK NORTH ON 
THURSDAY FOR A BRIEF PERIOD BEFORE SWINGING BACK THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT. WITH THE INSTABILITY IN THE WARM SECTOR AND 
SOME UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT...EVEN IF IT IS WEAKER THAN THE MODELS 
SUGGEST...WARRANTS A CHANCE OF AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS.

BEYOND THEN FORECAST IS LOOKING SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS. 
UPPER TROUGH WILL BE OVER THE GREAT LAKES BRINGING COOL CONDITIONS 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. CANNOT RULE OUT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AT ANY 
POINT BUT FOR NOW WILL LIMIT THE MENTION TO THE DAYTIME PERIODS OF 
FRIDAY AND SUNDAY WHEN THE BETTER CHANCE SEEMS TO BE.

19Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED SFC HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR LAKE 
ONTARIO WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOCATED ACRS THE UPR MS VALLEY INTO 
THE CNTRL PLAINS STATES.  

FIRST FCST PROBLEM WILL BE THE CURRENT CLOUD COVER ACRS THE CWFA.  
MORNING SOUNDINGS DETECTED AND CURRENT VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS QUITE 
A BIT OF STRATOCUMULUS/CUMULUS CLOUDS ACRS THE REGION.  IT SHOULD 
TAKE THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON FOR TEMPS TO PUSH INTO THE LOWER 
70S...JUST ENOUGH TO ALLOW CUMULUS CLOUD BASES TO RAISE HIGH ENOUGH 
TO MIX WITH DRIER AIR ALOFT.  SO...IF THIS HOLDS TRUE...CLOUDS 
SHOULD BECOME MORE CELLULAR WITH MUCH MORE CLEAR SPOTS IN 
BETWEEN...THEN GRADUALLY DISSIPATING AFTER SUNSET.  WITH MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES...LIGHT WINDS AND SOME GROUND MSTR LEFT OVER FROM 
CURRENT RAINS...WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG ATTM.

ALL MODELS AGREE ON A DEVELOPING H5 MID LVL RIDGE OVER THE OHIO VLY 
THIS WEEKEND IN RESPONSE TO A SIGNIFICANT H5 TROF OVER THE WRN 
UNITED STATES.  SKIES SHOULD START OUT MOSTLY SUNNY ON SATURDAY 
(WITH SOME LEFT OVER PATCHY FOG EARLY)...THEN PARTLY CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS SHOULD GET UNDERWAY BY EARLY AFTERNOON (2 PM).  ALL 
MODELS SHOW A RETURN LOW LVL FLOW FROM THE SOUTH TOMORROW...BUT ALL 
DISAGREE ON THE SFC DEWPOINTS AND BOUNDARY LAYER MSTR.  ATTM...THE 
ETA SEEMS TO HIGHS WITH SFC DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S BY 
AFTERNOON.  THE NGM SEEMS TO LOW WITH ONLY LOWER 60S DEWPOINTS.  A 
COMPROMISE OF THE AVN WITH SFC DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 60S EAST TO 
THE MID TO UPPER 60S WEST SEEMS LIKE THE BEST SOLUTION.  ALTHOUGH 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVERHEAD...MODIFIED SOUNDINGS WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S AND MAX HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S YIELD 
50 MB AVE CAPES OF ABOUT 2000 J/KG WITH NO CIN OR CAP.  THE DOWNSIDE 
OF THIS SITUATION IS THAT THERE IS NO FORCING GIVEN H5 RIDGE.  
HOWEVER...WITH THIS ENERGY...COULD NOT RULE OUT A 10 OR 20 PERCENT 
ISOLD THUNDERSTORM LATE IN THE DAY.  WILL MENTION PARTLY CLOUDY IN 
THE ZONES AND MENTION ISOLD CHC IN THE GRIDDED DATA.

THE SAME SCENARIO HOLDS TRUE FOR SUNDAY...EXCEPT ALL LOCATIONS 
SHOULD HAVE ABOUT A 20 POP IN THE AFTN TO EARLY EVENING.  
AGAIN...WILL MENTION PARTLY CLOUDY WITH A 20 POP LEFT IN THE GRIDDED 
DATA.

BETTER CHC/S FOR SHOWERS AND TSTMS CAN BE EXPECTED AS WE HEAD INTO 
THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK AS CONTINUED DESTABILIZATION AND PERHAPS 
SOME S/WV ENERGY COME TOGETHER.

A COLD FRONT WILL TRY TO MOVE THRU THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY.

RANGING FROM 50 POPS NW TO 30 POPS SE. MAIN THREAT WILL BE HAILERS 
SINCE WIND FIELDS ARENT THAT IMPRESSIVE. 

HAVE BUMPED POPS BY WEDNESDAY EVENING TO CATEGORICAL WITH OCCASIONAL 
WORDING. HAVE ONLY TOUCHED UP TEMPS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AND WENT 
SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN GUIDANCE ON WED INTO THURS SINCE COLD AIR 
BEHIND FRONT SEEMS TO BE UNDERDONE BY MODELS. 

AFTER FROPA LATE WEDNESDAY...HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE BUILDS IN 
AND A BROAD H5 RIDGE REMAINS OVER ERN U.S. AM CONCERNED THAT THERE 
WILL BE A GOOD AMOUNT OF CU ON BACK SIDE OF FRONT. STILL SOME 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE HERE AND DOWNWARD MOTION ISNT THAT IMPRESSIVE 
TO KILL CU DEVELOPMENT. WILL CHANGE MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY 
HERE...AND TEMPS STILL LOOK REASONABLE IN THE LOWER 70S.

WILL CONTINUE WITH PREVIOUS FCST AND JUST INCREASE DAYTIME TEMPS 2-3 
DEGREES EACH DAY WITH A GRADUAL MODIFICATION OF THE AIRMASS. 
MOISTURE SHOULD BEGIN TO STREAM BACK IN FROM THE GULF...BUT DO NOT 
THINK THAT THE MRF SOLUTION OF THE DIGGING H5 TROF IN THE WRN GULF 
STATES IS REASONABLE. ECMWF...UKMET...AND CANADIAN ALL SUGGEST A 
WEAK RIDGE WHICH CUTS THAT WIDE PATH OF PRECIP NOTED ON MRF. SINCE

RAIN/HAILERS OVER FAR NORTH AND NORTHEAST CWA THIS EVENING...BUT 
BLOWOFF SEEMS TO BE INHIBITING ACTIVITY ATTM. FRONT CONTINUES TO

THIS...INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE LOW LEVELS OF ATMOSPHERE WILL PRECEDE 
COLD FRONT PROGGED TO GO THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. PWATS INCREASE TO 
ALMOST 2 INCHES AND WILL MENTION POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY RAIN. 

WITH LACK OF GOOD UPPER SUPPORT IN THE WARM SECTOR FOR

0 AND 6Z AVN MODEL RUNS WERE SIGNIFICANTLY DRY FROM 0 TO 12Z 
THURSDAY...BUT WILL HAVE TO RE-INTRODUCE LIKELY POPS SINCE MODELS 
HAVE SLOWED DOWN SFC FRONT IN RESPONSE TO THE STRETCHING OF H5 TROF 
TO THE NW. WILL TRY TO ADD SOME TIMING FOR NWRN HALF OF FCST 
AREA...BUT AM STILL A LITTLE HESITANT.

AFTER FROPA...BROAD H5 RIDGE BUILDS OVER FCST AREA AND SFC HIGH

TEMPS WITH PARTLY CLOUDY/MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FOR THE LAST 3 OR 4 DAYS

MODELS SEEM TO HAVE COME INTO FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
MOVEMENT OF THE WARM FRONT ACROSS THE AREA AND IT IS TRENDING 
TOWARDS A SLOWER SOLUTION. LOOKS LIKE THE BOUNDARY WILL ONLY MAKE IT 
TO ABOUT A DAYTON TO CHILLICOTHE LINE BY 00Z.

NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH FORCING FOR PRECIPITATION TODAY. PLENTY OF 
INSTABILITY ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE FRONT. AND THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY TO THE NORTH OF THE FRONT TO SUPPORT 
THUNDERSTORMS. BUT LOW LEVEL JET WILL BE WEAKENING AS IT MOVES 
EASTWARD. LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE ONE SHORT WAVE THAT WILL CROSS 
THE AREA DURING THE MORNING. BUT TRYING TO PICK OUT ANY UPPER 
SUPPORT BEYOND THAT IS DIFFICULT. SO WILL JUST GO WITH CHANCE 
PROBABILITIES FOR TODAY WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES TO THE NORTH. WILL 
CONTINUE A CHANCE THROUGH MIDNIGHT IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA 
BUT BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE IF ANY ACTIVITY REMAINING TO THE 
SOUTH OF THE FRONT AFTER THE LOSS OF HEATING. 

TEMPERATURES WILL BE A CHALLENGE WITH THE FRONT LIFTING THROUGH THE 
AREA ALTHOUGH GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE FAIRLY CLOSE. HIGH MODEL RELATIVE 
HUMIDITIES HAVE NOT BEEN EQUATING TO A LOT OF CLOUD COVER. SO EXPECT 
PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES WHICH MAY ALLOW READINGS TO BE A 
DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN GUIDANCE.

FRONT WILL BE TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AND THERE 
WILL BE PLENTY OF INSTABILITY ALTHOUGH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A 
TRIGGER. WILL GO WITH A GENERIC CHANCE FOR DIURNAL THUNDERSTORMS. 
LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A RATHER HOT DAY ALTHOUGH SOME OF THE 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS MAY BE A BIT ON THE HIGH SIDE.

LATEST AVIATION MODEL IS SIMILAR TO THE LAST EUROPEAN RUN. SO EXPECT 
A COLD FRONT TO MOVE ACROSS THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY. THEN A COOLER 
AND DRY HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD BUILD IN FOR THE END OF THE WEEK.

LATEST SURFACE MAP SHOWS COLD FRONT JUST MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE 
NORTHERN ZONES AT THIS TIME. THIS FRONT SHOULD PROGRESS THROUGH THE 
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA BY MID MORNING BEFORE STALLING OUT. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ENDED FOR THE TIME BEING. BUT SUSPECT THERE WILL 
BE MORE DEVELOPMENT NEAR THE BOUNDARY DURING THE DAY WITH HEATING 
AND ALSO THE APPROACH OF A SHORT WAVE. SO WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY PRIMARILY FOR THE SOUTHERN ZONES. 
THE SHORT WAVE SHOULD ALSO BRING A GOOD AMOUNT OF MID LEVEL CLOUDS 
ACROSS THE AREA.

THE FRONT MAY START TO SLOWLY LIFT BACK NORTH TONIGHT BUT IT LOOKS 
LIKE MOST OF THE MOVEMENT WILL WAIT UNTIL MONDAY. EXPECT SOME 
PRECIPITATION ALONG AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY TONIGHT ALTHOUGH NOW 
IT APPEARS THAT THE BETTER FORCING WILL BE WELL WEST OF THE AREA 
WHERE THE LOW LEVEL JET WILL BE LOCATED. THIS WILL SHIFT EASTWARD ON 
MONDAY. BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON MONDAY INTO 
MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE NEAR THE FRONT ALTHOUGH CANNOT DISCOUNT SOME 
ACTIVITY OCCURRING IN THE WARM SECTOR.

AVIATION AND CANADIAN MODELS SHOW FRONT LIFTING WELL NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY BEFORE BACK INTO THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY.

GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES RUNNING FAIRLY CLOSE TODAY AND TONIGHT AND SAW 
NO REASON TO VARY MUCH FROM THEM. HOWEVER BELIEVE GUIDANCE IS TOO 
COOL FOR MONDAY AS WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH. READINGS SEEM TO BE BACK

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES WEAK NEARLY STATIONARY COLD FRONT ACROSS 
SOUTHERN OHIO AND INDIANA.  MOST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE OF THE FRONT 
IN THE SURFACE OBSERVATIONS IS THE TDS.  NORTH OF FRONT TDS ARE IN 
THE 50S WHILE SOUTH IS IN THE LOWER 70S.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE SURFACE PATTERN.  THERE 
ARE ONLY SUBTLE DIFFERENCE WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THE WEAK NEARLY 
STATIONARY BOUNDARY OVER FA.  WILL GO WITH THE ETA SOLUTION SINCE IT 
HAS BETTER LOW LEVEL RESOLUTION.  BOTH MODELS PUSH FRONT SOUTH ON 
SUNDAY BEFORE BRINGING IT BACK AS A WARM FRONT ON SUNDAY.  NOT TOO 
SURE HOW FAR SOUTH IT WILL GET WITH THE WEAK SURFACE FLOW BUT THE 
MID LEVEL FLOW SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PUSH IT AT LEAST SOUTH OF 
FA.  WARM FRONT WILL THEN REMAIN ACROSS NORTHERN OHIO UNTIL 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT PUSHES THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

THREAT WILL BE WIND AND HAIL.  ANY DEVELOPMENT WILL LIKELY TURN

THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING HOURS.

MODELS SHOW INSTABILITY INCREASING DRAMATICALLY DURING THE

APPROACHING COLD FRONT. ONLY THIS ONE SHOULD MAKE IT THROUGH THE 
AREA TONIGHT. BEST CHANCE OF RAIN SHOULD AGAIN BE ALONG AND SOUTH OF 
I-70. IT SHOULD BE ANOTHER VERY WARM DAY PERHAPS A DEGREE OR TWO 
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY.

THE FRONT WILL STALL JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA ON SUNDAY BEFORE SLOWLY 
MOVING BACK NORTH ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. THE BOUNDARY SHOULD BE 
CLOSE ENOUGH TO WARRANT A MENTION OF PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTHWEST 
ZONES ON SUNDAY BUT NOT ELSEWHERE. TEMPERATURES COULD BE AS MUCH AS 
10 DEGREES COOLER AND GENERALLY COMPROMISED BETWEEN GUIDANCE NUMBERS.

SHORT WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES THIS MORNING AND WILL BE TO 
THE EAST OF THE AREA BY PEAK HEATING TAKING DEEPER MOISTURE WITH IT. 
SURFACE TROUGH WILL BE LAGGING BEHIND THE UPPER WAVE AND COME 
THROUGH IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. CONVERGENCE DOES NOT LOOK 
PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE. HOWEVER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ZONES. AND WITH GOOD HEATING EXPECT 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP WITH BETTER COVERAGE 
IN THE SOUTHERN HALF WHERE PRECIPITATION COULD LINGER INTO THE 
EVENING.

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS THE AREA OVERNIGHT 
BEHIND THE SURFACE TROUGH. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD STILL BE NEARBY 
AND RETURN AS FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWEST EARLY SATURDAY. WINDS 
EVENTUALLY BECOME WEST WHICH COULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO SOAR AND 
RESULT IN A VERY UNSTABLE AIRMASS ON SATURDAY. WITH AN APPROACHING 
COLD FRONT EXPECT MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

LOOKS LIKE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY 
NIGHT AND REMAIN THERE ON SUNDAY. BOTH THE AVIATION AND ETA SUGGEST 
THAT THE FRONT WILL RETURN NORTH ON SUNDAY NIGHT AS LOW PRESSURE 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. IF THIS PANS OUT THEN MONDAY COULD BE 
ANOTHER VERY WARM DAY AFTER READINGS DROP BACK INTO THE UPPER 70S 
AND LOWER 80S ON SUNDAY.

A WARM...MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL CONTINUE ACRS THE CWFA

CURRENTLY...MODELS SHOW A SPLIT FLOW PATTERN ACRS THE ERN UNITED 
STATES.  AT 06Z...AN H5 CLOSED LOW WAS LOCATED OVER THE LOWER MS VLY 
WITH AN H5 HIGH/LOW COUPLET LOCATED OFF THE MID ATLANTIC/COASTAL 
CAROLINAS.  MEANWHILE...NRN JET STREAM S/WVS WERE LOCATED ACRS THE 
UPR MS VLY AND GREAT LAKES REGION.  IT WILL BE THE APCH OF THE UPR 
MS VLY S/WV THAT WILL PROVIDE THE UPR DIV NECESSARY FOR TSTM 
DEVELOPMENT LATER THIS AFTN ACRS THE WRN CWFA.  AT THE SAME 
TIME...MODELS SHOW A FOCUSED AREA OF SFC TO 850 MB CONV ACRS THE ERN 
CWFA THIS AFTN.  THUS...THE UPR DIV AND LOW LVL CONV ARE NOT 
COINCIDENT WITH EACH OTHER EXCEPT WHERE THEY INTERSECT ACRS THE 
CNTRL PART OF THE CWFA.   BOTTOM LINE:  WITH MOIST AND UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS (SBCAPES ANTICIPATED IN THE 1500 J/KG RANGE AGAIN THIS AFTN) 
UPR DIV AND LOW LEVEL CONV WILL EQUALLY PROVIDE FOR SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND TSTMS ACRS THE ENTIRE CWFA.  AS A RESULT...ALL LOCATIONS 
WILL BE GIVEN A 50 POP TODAY.  STORM MOTION IS FORECAST TO BE QUITE 
SLOW ONCE AGAIN (AROUND 10 MPH).  ALSO...PROPAGATION VECTOR MAY 
EQUAL OR SLIGHTLY EXCEED THE MEAN ADVECTIVE WIND...PROVIDING FOR 
SOME BACKBUILDING TSTMS.  CONSEQUENTLY...WILL HAVE TO MENTION HEAVY 
RAIN POTENTIAL IN THE ZONES TODAY INTO THIS EVENING.  WILL NOT GO 
WITH A FLOOD WATCH ATTM GIVEN THE SCATTERED NATURE OF THE 
PCPN...ALTHOUGH A FEW FLOOD/FLASH FLOOD WARNINGS ARE QUITE 
CONCEIVABLE.

FOR TONIGHT...MS VLY S/WV MOVES INTO THE ERN GREAT LAKES...TAKING 
WITH IT THE ASSOCD PVA/UPR DIV.  SHOWERS AND TSTMS SHOULD GRADUALLY 
DIMINISH BY MIDNIGHT.

FRIDAY LOOKS TO BE INTERESTING.  ANOTHER S/WV IN THE NRN JET STREAM 
DIVES SE TOWARD OUR REGION.  AN ASSOCD COLD FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED 
ACRS THE FAR NWRN CWFA BY MID AFTN AND SOUTH OF A CMH TO DAY LINE BY 
FRIDAY EVENING.  POOLING OF MID 60S DEWPOINT AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT...SFC TO 925 MB LOW LEVEL CONV AND PLENTY OF DAY TIME 
INSOLATION WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO PUSH INTO THE MID AND UPPER 80S 
SHOULD TRIGGER A LINE OF CONVECTION OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT.  
ATTM WILL BROAD BRUSH ENTIRE REGION WITH 50 POPS.  STORM PREDICTION 
CENTER HAS REGION UNDER A SLIGHT RISK OF SVR TSTMS ON FRIDAY.  GIVEN 
THAT...AND SFC TO 500 MB DIFFERENTIAL THETA E VALUES EXCEED 25 
K...THE POSSIBILITY OF WET MICROBURSTS LOOKS GOOD.  LARGE HAIL WILL 
ALSO BE POSSIBLE.

AREA LATE TONIGHT...BUT CURRENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE SHIFT IN 
WINDS ENHANCING THE VORT AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP WEST OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI WILL NOT HOLD UP TO THE ZONAL FLOW RIDING OVER THE RIDGE 
ALONG THE EAST COAST. NO REAL LLJET SETTING UP TONIGHT EITHER...JUST 
A NARROW COLUMN OF INCREASED SPEED.

WITH THAT IN MIND...AM NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH PRECIP CHANCES 
TONIGHT IN THE NORTHWEST. GUT FEELING IS THAT IT WONT HAPPEN UNTIL

BACK NORTH FRIDAY NIGHT.  AT 500 MB WESTERLY ZONAL FLOW PERSISTS.  
TYPICALLY IN THIS PATTERN THE FRONT HAS A HARD TIME MAKING IT

WILL GRADUALLY BRING THE CLOUDS IN OVERNIGHT AND KEEP THE 30 POPS IN

ENDING AT 6 PM.  WANTED TO TAKE OUT POPS ACROSS PARTS OF NRN KY/PMH

RATHER EXTENSIVE AREA OF STRATOCUMULUS HAS DEVELOPED THIS AFTERNOON.

ZONES INTO THE EARLY EVENING BUT THEN SHOULD DISSIPATE. HOWEVER 
CLOUDS MAY PERSIST WELL INTO THE NIGHT ESPECIALLY ACROSS EASTERN 
SECTIONS WHERE MODELS SHOW FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE SLIDING ACROSS 
THE AREA WITH A DISTURBANCE MOVING SOUTHWARD. IF THIS PANS OUT THEN 
FROST FORMATION MAY BE IN QUESTION. BUT THINK SKIES SHOULD SCATTER 
OUT EVERYWHERE BY LATE TONIGHT. WINDS WILL WEAKEN ALTHOUGH MAY NOT 
GO CALM. SO PROTECTED AREAS MAY STILL GET SOME FROST IN THE EAST. 
WESTERN ZONES LOOK A LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE FOR FROST FORMATION AS 
GRADIENT SHOULD BE WEAKER AND SKIES ARE EXPECTED TO CLEAR OUT. THUS 
ADVISORY WILL CONTINUE FOR THE ENTIRE AREA.

ROTATE AROUND UPPER TROUGH. WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN FOR 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA SUNDAY AFTERNOON. EXPECT THESE TO DIMINISH

MAY STAY UP AS A SURFACE TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. WILL GO WITH 
A DRY FORECAST ON MONDAY ALTHOUGH A FEW SHOWERS ARE NOT OUT OF THE

MORNINGS ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE SURFACE HIGH SETTLES IN 
WITH LIGHT WINDS AND A DRY AIRMASS. WILL FOLLOW ALONG WITH IDEA OF

COLD FRONT CURRENTLY EXTNDG ACRS CTRL WVA AND CTRL KY BACK TO LO 
PRES IN W TENN.  RAIN ALONG AND NORTH OF FRONT...WITH PCPN NOW 
EXTNDG UP INTO SOUTHERN HALF OF OHIO.  ETA/AVN SIMILAR IN BRINGING 
SFC WAVE ACRS EASTERN KY OVERNIGHT TO MID ATLANTIC COAST BY 12Z SAT.

BOTH ETA/AVN SPREAD PCPN ACRS FA THIS EVENING...ENDING RAIN FROM NW 
TO SE AS LO PUSHES TO THE EAST OF OH VALLEY OVERNIGHT.  WL GO 
CATEGORICAL POPS EVERYWHERE...ADDING TIMING TO END PCPN AS EXPCT IT 
TO END ACRS W CNTRL OH AND DAY VICINITY LATE EVENING... AROUND 
06Z ALONG THE I-71 CORRIDOR...AND TOWARDS DAYBREAK IN THE PMH ZONE.  
PWATS AROUND 1.5 INCHES GET INTO FAR SOUTHERN COUNTIES AROUND 
00Z...WITH QPF APRCHG 1 INCH.  NOT EXPECTING TSTMS AS NO INSTABILITY 
PROGGED OVER REGION TONIGHT.  FEEL THAT SOME AREAS ALONG THE OH 
RIVER WILL SEE AROUND AN INCH FROM THIS EVENT...BUT PCPN WILL FALL 
OVER AN EXTND PERIOD OF SVRL HRS...AND FLOODING WILL NOT BE A 
PROBLEM.  WILL BRING PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES IN LATE FOR ALL BUT FAR SE 
SCTNS.  FWC BRINGS COLDER AIR IN TOO FAST...SO WL STICK WITH WARMER 
MAV NUMBERS.

MODELS KEEP LO LVL MOISTURE ACRS REGION ALL DAY SAT WHICH WILL LEAD 
TO PLENTY OF CU IN THE AFTN.  WILL HIT CLOUD COVER HARDER IN PMH 
ZONE AND GO MO CLOUDY.  MAV GIVING 60 IN HTS AND 49 IN FDY...BOTH OF 
WHICH SEEM TOO EXTREME.  WILL STAY CLOSE TO FWC NUMBERS...WHICH KEEP 
AREA IN LO TO MID 50S.

FROST POTENTIAL A MAJOR CONCERN FOR SAT NIGHT AS SKIES CLR AND WINDS 
GO LIGHT.  THINK RECORD LOWS ARE IN JEOPARDY AT CVG (37)...CMH (37) 
AND DAY (37).  BOTH FWC AND MAV GIVING MID 30S...AND LOOKING AT LO 
LVL THCKNS THIS LOOKS REASONABLE.

LIKE MAV TEMPS FOR SUN...AS EXPCT MORE CLOUDS AND A FEW SHOWERS WITH 
UPR LVL S/WV TRACKING ACRS AREA.  FROST WL AGAIN BE A CONCERN SUN 
NIGHT AS PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES DEVLP AND WINDS GO LIGHT.  
HOWEVER...MAY BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER WITH FEW MORE CLOUDS AND 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER THCKNS VALUES.  WL BE CLOSE AGAIN WITH RECORDS FOR 
MON MORN AT CVG (35)...CMH (36) AND DAY (37).

FOR EXTENDED...UPPER LVL LOW WILL REMAIN PARKED SE OF JAMES BAY WITH

COLD FRONT NOW LOCATED FROM N LOWER MI...TO N OF CHI...TO NE 
KANSAS.  LARGE AREA OF RAIN WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS MICH 
AND MUCH OF WESTERN IND AND NORTHERN ILL.  CONVECTION BEGINNING TO 
DEVELOP ACRS SW MO.

ETA/AVN ARE SIMILAR IN BRINGING PRECIP INTO AREAS N OF I-70 THIS 
EVENING...AND INTO CVG AND PMH ZONES AROUND 04Z.  INSTABILITY IS 
MARGINAL WITH THIS SYSTEM...AS LI VALUES APPROACH -1 IN N KY AND SW 
OH.  THUNDERSTORMS ARE A GOOD BET...BUT AM NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING 
MORE THAN AN ISOLATED SVR STORM.  THE GREATER CONCERN WILL BE THE 
THREAT FOR HVY RAIN...CONSIDERING HOW WET THE OH VALLEY HAS BEEN THE 
LAST FEW WEEKS.  PWATS DO APPROACH 1.5 INCHES...AND AVN QPF AMTS ARE 
BETWEEN 0.5 AND 0.75 INCHES.  HOWEVER...1 HOUR FFG VALUES HAVE 
RECOVERED ENOUGH IN THE SOUTH THAT I AM INCLINED TO NOT GO WITH A 
FLOOD WATCH TONIGHT.  WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF HVY RAIN...CANNOT RULE 
OUT SOME ISOLATED FLOODING.  BUT DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING WIDESPREAD 
LIKE EVENTS OF PREVIOUS COUPLE OF WEEKS. WL GO CATEGORICAL POPS
EVERYWHERE TONIGHT. 

ETA/AVN BRING FRONT ACRS NORTHERN ZONES BETWEEN 06-09Z AND TO THE OH 
RIVER AROUND 12Z.  THE MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE ON FRI AS THE ETA 
TAKES THE FRONT MUCH FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE AVN.  THE AVN LINGERS 
PCPN ACRS OUR SOUTH IN RESPONSE TO THE SFC WAVE IN W KY.  THE ETA 
DEVLPS THE WAVE ACRS N MISSISSIPPI...AND THUS KEEPS THE BULK OF THE 
RAIN FURTHER SOUTH.  THE AVN ALSO DEVLPS AN AREA OF PCPN N OF THE 
FRONT NEAR STL FRI AFTN...BRINGING THIS ACRS THE CWA FRI EVENING.  
WITH AIR QUITE STABLE NORTH OF THE FRONT...FEEL THAT THIS PCPN
AREA IS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK AND WILL DISREGARD.  WILL USE A BLEND OF 
THE ETA/AVN...KEEPING POPS ACRS OUR SOUTH ON FRI WITH SLOWER FRONTAL 
PASSAGE.  WILL TAKE PCPN CHANCES OUT FOR FRI NIGHT EXCEPT FOR 
SILENT 20 POPS OVER PMH...AS LIKE ETA SOLN OF SFC WAVE SLIDING UP 
THE APLACHNS.  WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN SATURDAY...WILL GO 
PARTLY CLOUDY ALL LOCATIONS.

LOOKING OUT IN THE EXTENDED...OMEGA-LIKE BLOCKING PATTERN WILL SET 
UP AS UPPER LOW GETS TRAPPED SE OF JAMES BAY.  AS A RESULT...OHIO 
VALLEY WILL REMAIN IN A COOL AND UNSETTLED PATTERN BEGINNING SUNDAY 
INTO ERLY-MID WEEK...AS DEEP TROF DEVLPS OVER EASTERN US.  THERE IS 
A THREAT FOR INSTABILITY SHOWERS SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS DISTURBANCES 
ROTATE AROUND THE BASE OF THE TROF.  WILL BEGIN SLOW WARMING TREND 
MONDAY AS UPPER LOW INCHES SLOWLY TOWARDS CANADIAN COAST.  TROF 
FINALLY PULLS OUT BY WED WITH UPPER RIDGE DEVLPING ACRS OH VALLEY 
FOR MID-LATE WEEK.  THIS WILL BRING A RETURN TO NORMAL TEMPS AND A 
MUCH NEEDED PERIOD OF EXTND DRY WEATHER.

WILL ISSUE ESF TO ADDRESS FRIDAY PCPN.

A COMPLICATED FORECAST PROBLEM. FIRST MUST DEAL WITH THE ONSET OF 
PRECIP TDY. BOTH THE ETA/AVN HAVE TRENDED A BIT SLOWER WITH THE 
FRONT DURING THIS PERIOD. WILL KEEP LKLY POPS W-CTRL OH AND CHC 
ELSEWHERE. WILL KEEP S-CTRL DRY. FOR TONIGHT...FEEL THE HIGHEST POPS 
WILL BE FOR OUR DAY AND CMH GROUPS AS THIS FRONT MOVES SLOWLY SE 
WITH A WK WAVE POSSIBLY DEVELOPING ON IT. LLVL FORCING IS WELL 
DEFINED FOR THIS EVENT...EVEN THOUGH UPPER LVL FORCING ONLY 
MARGINAL. AXIS OF INSTABILITY WILL HELP INITIATE TSRA ACTIVITY AS 
WELL. WITH THE MESOSCALE MAKEUP OF THIS PRECIP EVENT...HAVE DECIDED 
NOT TO GO WITH FLOOD WATCH AT THIS TIME. QPF HAS DOUBLED WITH THIS 
ETA RUN. CONFIDENCE IS HIGH FOR A PRECIP EVENT...BUT NOT HIGH ENOUGH 
FOR FLOOD EVENT. AT LEAST NOT FOR PINPOINTING SPECIFIC AREA. HVY 
RAINS WILL BE DURING THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. IF WATCH IS WARRANTED DAY 
SHIFT WILL HAVE AMPLE TIME TO DISCEMINATE.

FRONT SHOULD MOVE S OF OUR FA ON FRIDAY...PROVIDING FOR A BRIEF 
BREAK. HOWEVER BOTH THE ETA/AVN DEVELOPING A WAVE BACK IN MO AREA 
AND THEN MOVEING IT EAST ALONG FRONT. CURRENT THOUGHTS ARE FOR 
SECOND ROUND OF PRECIP TO MOVE INTO THE ILN FA LATER FRI/FRI NIGHT. 
FEEL THIS WILL AFFECT MAINLY SRN PORTION OF FA. THIS SHOULD BE MORE 
OF AN OVERRUNING SITUATION WITH NO CURRENT INDICATION FOR ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY TO PLAY A ROLE IN TSRA ACTIVITY. WILL HIGHLIGHT BOTH 
PRECIP EVENTS IN AN ESF. AFTER THIS...MUCH COOLER WX WILL MOVE IN.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES A DEVELOPING LOW IN THE MID MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY WITH ITS ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT AROUND I-70.  SATELLITE 
IMAGERY INDICATES FAVORED CONVECTION ZONE FROM KANSAS INTO MICHIGAN.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THIS EVENING THEN THE AVN 
AND ETA DIFFER TO SOME DEGREE.  THE AVN IS A BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE AND 
FARTHER NORTH WITH SECONDARY WAVE SWINGING THROUGH OHIO VALLEY.  
THIS WAVE WILL BRING SOME GOOD SOAKING RAINS.  THIS AREA HAS SEEN 
PLENTY OF RAIN LATELY AND FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE IS GENERALLY BELOW 2 
INCHES FOR A 3 HOUR RAIN.  PWS APPROACH 2 INCHES TONIGHT INTO 
MONDAY.

CONVECTION TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF FA WILL SLIDE INTO NORTHERN FA 
TODAY.  RAINFALL WILL BE HEAVY IN SOME LOCALS BUT GROUND SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO HANDLE MOST OF IT.  NORTHERN FA HAS NOT SEEN AS MUCH RAIN AS 
SOUTHERN HALF AND ONLY EXPECT AT MOST A COUPLE OF FLOOD WARNINGS.

SEVERE THREAT TODAY EXISTS IN THE WARM SECTOR.  TEMPS WILL REACH 
INTO THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S WITH TDS IN THE UPPER 60S TO CLOSE 
TO 70 WILL GIVE FA CAPE AROUND 2000 J/KG WITH VERY LITTLE

MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH PUSHING THE SURFACE HIGH TO

LINE OF CONVECTION QUICKLY MOVING ACROSS THE AREA AND EXPECT IT TO 
BE EAST OF THE ZONES SHORTLY AFTER MIDDAY. JUST SOME TRAILING LIGHT 
SHOWERS TO DEAL WITH AFTER THAT. LATEST SURFACE MAP SHOWS COLD FRONT 
MOVING ACROSS INDIANA. EXPECT THIS TO RAPIDLY MOVE ACROSS THE AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES DO NOT EXPECT MUCH IF ANY 
RECOVERY TO THE AIRMASS AHEAD OF THE FRONT. SO WILL PROBABLY KEEP 
JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS UNTIL FRONTAL PASSAGE. 

WILL SEND UPDATED ZONES ONCE BAND OF CONVECTION GETS A LITTLE 
FURTHER EAST. AT THAT TIME WILL GO AHEAD AND CANCEL THE FLOOD WATCH. 
WILL HAVE TO LOWER HIGH TEMPERATURES AND MAY EVEN INDICATE FALLING 
TEMPERATURES FOR WESTERN ZONES DURING THE AFTERNOON. 

ILN...NONE.

LATEST SFC MAP SHOWS COLD FRONT IN WESTERN OHIO.  CLEAR SKIES WEST 
OF IND.  FWC HAS FINALLY STABILIZED ON LOWS TONIGHT AND IS CLOSE TO 
ETA WITH MAV A LITTLE WARMER AT CMH.

FWC GETTING WARMER AND WARMER FOR FRIDAY.  THICKNESSES...MAV AND 
SNDG TECHNIQUES POINT TO A 63 TO 68 RANGE.  WILL GO COOLER THAN FWC.

TEMPS AT CVG FRIDAY NIGHT DEPEND ON CLOUD COVER.  AVN AND ETA 
SUGGESTS MID DECK MAY BE THERE AROUND 6Z-9Z.  WOULD LIKE TO GO LOWER 
HERE BUT CLOUDS MAKE UPPER 40S LOOK REASONABLE.  DAY AND CMH LOOK

240 AM EDT THU MAY 9 2002

LATEST SFC ANALYSIS INDICATED A WARM FRONT FROM NEAR CLE-DFI...THEN 
BACK NW TO A LOW IN SW WI.  COLD FRONT RAN FROM LOW THROUGH IA INTO 
NORTHERN MO.

COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO CROSS THE FA THIS AFTERNOON.  LATEST RUNS 
ARE A LITTLE SLOWER WITH FROPA COMPARED TO YESTERDAYS 00Z MODELS.  
ETA/AVN SIMILAR ON TIMING...HAVING THE FRONT NR OH/IN LINE AT 
18Z...THEN EAST OF OHIO BY 00Z.  NGM IS A TAD SLOWER.  NGM LOOKS TOO 
SLOW...PREFER THE ETA/AVN TIMING.  WITH FROPA DURING EARLY 
AFTERNOON...CAPES MANAGE TO RISE TO NEAR 1000 WITH LI DROPPING -2 TO 
-3.  COULD SEE A FEW TRW GO SEVERE WITH FROPA...SO WILL MENTION 
CHANCE OF SEVERE IN THE ZONES.

ALSO, PW PUSH TO BETWEEN 1.5 AND 2.0 AHEAD OF FRONT.  SHOULD BE 
PLENTY OF MOISTURE FOR THUNDERSTORMS TO WORK WITH...SO WILL ADD 
HEAVY RAIN WORDING ALL ZONES.   ITH GROUND ALREADY SATURATED...FFG 
AROUND 0.5 IN MANY LOCATIONS...SEE NO NEED TO DROP FFA.  WONT EXPAND 
THE WATCH INTO CENTRAL OH OR NRN MIAMI VALLEY AS THESE ARES HAVE 
BEEN SPARED THE HEAVY RAINS OF THE PAST FEW DAYS AND SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO HANDLE THE EXPECTED QPF.  

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN TONIGHT...BRINGING CLEAR SKIES.  SURFACE 
HIGH LOOKS LIKE IT TRIES TO BUILD INTO KY.  IN THIS SETUP THE AREA 
AROUND CVG ALWAYS SEEMS TO GET COOLER THAN EXPECTED...SO WILL UNDER 
CUT MOS AND CURRENT FORECAST BY A CATEGORY.  ELSEWHERE FORECAST 
NUMBERS LOOK GOOD.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING SUNNY SKIES TO THE FA ON FRIDAY.  NEW MOS 
NUMBERS LOOK WARM.  WILL STICK WITH THE CURRENT FCST HIGHS ON 
FRIDAY.  

FINALLY MODELS ARE HINTING AT RETURN MOISTURE AND POSSIBLE SOME QPF 
FRIDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTH.  WITH THE AREA IN 
SOUTHEAST...THIS DOWN SLOPING SHOULD EAT AWAY AT ANY PRECIP THAT TRY 
TO MOVE NORTH FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

CLEMISILN OUT LATER.

AND 925 WINDS PICK UP TOWARDS 12Z THIS MORNING.  THIS SHOULD AID IN 
DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY.  PREFER THE ETA 
SOLUTION WHICH KEEPS THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS 
OF THE FA.  CURRENT FLOOD WATCH SEEMS TO HAVE THIS AREA COVERED WELL.

FRONT PUSHES NORTH DURING THE DAY.  THIS SHOULD PUSH THE BULK OF THE 
RAIN WITH IT.  ATMOSPHERE OBVIOUSLY BECOMES UNSTABLE WITH CAPES TO 
1500 AND LI TO -4...BUT CIN INCREASES.  WILL TAPER OFF TO CHANCE 
POPS IN THE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE SOUTH AND LATE IN THE NORTH.

TONIGHT SHOULD BE DRY AS COLD FRONT REMAINS TO THE WEST.  FRONT 
SWINGS THROUGH ON THURSDAY.  WILL GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS WITH

TEMPERATURES TRICKY TODAY AND TOMORROW.  CURRENTLY NUMBERS LOOK GOOD

OBSERVATIONS IN SERN FCST AREA ARE GOING SOUTH WITH THE FOG. WILL 
ISSUE AN ADVISORY FOR DENSE FOG UNTIL 10 AM FOR SERN FCST AREA. FOR 
CVG AND CMH ZONES...WILL JUST MENTION PATCHY DENSE FOG THROUGH 8 OR 
9 AM SINCE ACTUAL SHIELD SHOULDNT GET TOO FAR INTO THESE ZONES FOR 
WIDESPREAD CRITERIA.

ALSO...HAVE INCLUDED AREAS OF FOG IN THE SOUTHEAST THIS MORNING AND 
BUMPED MONDAY AFTERNOON POPS TO 40 AND 50 PERCENT.

.......
AM HAVING A REAL HARD TIME FINDING WHY MODELS ARE PAINTING AN INCH 
PLUS OF QPF OVER FCST AREA MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. AS FAR AS I 
CAN TELL...THE ONLY REASON TO EVEN INCLUDE QPF IS BECAUSE OF SOME 
WEAK LLVL CONVERGENCE AND HIGH PEFFS WITH AXIS OF INCREASED PRECIP 
H2O OVER AREA DUE TO A WIDE OPEN GULF. OMEGA FIELDS ARE GOOD...BUT 
IM NOT SEEING ANY REAL TROF COMING THROUGH IN THE UPPER OR MID 
LEVELS. VORT FIELDS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE...WHICH ISNT SUPRISING 
IN GOOD ZONAL FLOW. LOOKED FOR AN UPPER JET TO INDICATE A LARGE 
AREA OF DIVERGENCE...BUT ITS NOT THERE EITHER. CURRENT FCST HAS 30 
POPS ON MON NITE AND TUESDAY WITH A 40 POP TUES PM. NEAR AS I CAN 
TELL...MID AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT ISNT THERE SINCE THERES A 
RELATIVE RIDGE OVER OHVLY WITH ONLY WEAK PERTUBATIONS MOVING THROUGH.

THETA E ADVECTION KICKS IN ON MONDAY...BUT ETA IS SHOWING A 
NOTICEABLE LACK OF SFC BASED INSTABILITY AND ONLY EXPECT SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS.

WILL ONLY RAISE POPS SLIGHTLY TO A 40 PERCENT CHANCE THROUGH THIS 
TIME FRAME...BUT AM CONCERNED WHY I CANT SEE WHAT MODELS ARE 
SHOWING WITH REGARDS TO PRECIP. HAVE JUST LOOKED AT THE NEW NCEP 
PMDHMD AND THANK THEM FOR THE REASON FOR THE EXCESSIVE QPF DUE TO 
LATENT HEAT FEEDBACK.

NOW FOR TEMPS...FWC SEEMS A BIT WARM...BUT FULL SUN AND INCREASING 
THICKNESSES TELLS ME NOT TO SHAVE ANY FROM GUIDANCE. 850 WINDS 
INCREASE TONIGHT...AND REALLY GET GOING ON MONDAY WITH A 50 KT JET 
SHOWN ON THE ETA THROUGH TUES MORNING. THIS STRONG OF A JET SEEMS A 
LITTLE OVERDONE BUT NOT BY MUCH AND PM LOWS MONDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE

AM HAVING A REAL HARD TIME FINDING WHY MODELS ARE PAINTING AN INCH 
PLUS OF QPF OVER FCST AREA MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. AS FAR AS I 
CAN TELL...THE ONLY REASON TO EVEN INCLUDE QPF IS BECAUSE OF SOME 
WEAK LLVL CONVERGENCE AND HIGH PEFFS WITH AXIS OF INCREASED PRECIP 
H2O OVER AREA DUE TO A WIDE OPEN GULF. OMEGA FIELDS ARE GOOD...BUT 
IM NOT SEEING ANY REAL TROF COMING THROUGH IN THE UPPER OR MID 
LEVELS. VORT FIELDS ARE ALL OVER THE PLACE...WHICH ISNT SUPRISING 
IN GOOD ZONAL FLOW. LOOKED FOR AN UPPER JET TO INDICATE A LARGE 
AREA OF DIVERGENCE...BUT ITS NOT THERE EITHER. CURRENT FCST HAS 30 
POPS ON MON NITE AND TUESDAY WITH A 40 POP TUES PM. NEAR AS I CAN 
TELL...MID AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT ISNT THERE SINCE THERES A 
RELATIVE RIDGE OVER OHVLY WITH ONLY WEAK PERTUBATIONS MOVING THROUGH.

THETA E ADVECTION KICKS IN ON MONDAY...BUT ETA IS SHOWING A 
NOTICEABLE LACK OF SFC BASED INSTABILITY AND ONLY EXPECT SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS.

WILL ONLY RAISE POPS SLIGHTLY TO A 40 PERCENT CHANCE THROUGH THIS 
TIME FRAME...BUT AM CONCERNED WHY I CANT SEE WHAT MODELS ARE 
SHOWING WITH REGARDS TO PRECIP. HAVE JUST LOOKED AT THE NEW NCEP 
PMDHMD AND THANK THEM FOR THE REASON FOR THE EXCESSIVE QPF DUE TO 
LATENT HEAT FEEDBACK.

NOW FOR TEMPS...FWC SEEMS A BIT WARM...BUT FULL SUN AND INCREASING 
THICKNESSES TELLS ME NOT TO SHAVE ANY FROM GUIDANCE. 850 WINDS 
INCREASE TONIGHT...AND REALLY GET GOING ON MONDAY WITH A 50 KT JET 
SHOWN ON THE ETA THROUGH TUES MORNING. THIS STRONG OF A JET SEEMS A 
LITTLE OVERDONE BUT NOT BY MUCH AND PM LOWS MONDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE 
AROUND 60 OR IN THE LOW 60S. 

WILL NOT MESS WITH THE EXTENDED PORTION OF THE FCST TONIGHT...WITH 
FRONT THROUGH 1/2 OF FCST AREA BY 12Z THURS.

WITH MID AND HIGH CLOUDS MOVING INTO OUR ERN CWFA AND WITH TEMPS 
HOVERING IN THE LOWER 40S...WILL NOT CONTINUE THE FROST ADVISORY FOR 
THE EARLY PART OF TODAY THERE.

A SOMEWHAT COMPLICATED FCST FOR THE FIRST PERIOD...THEN THINGS 
BECOME A LITTLE MORE CLEAR CUT FOR SUNDAY.

A S/WV WAS NOTED ON WATER VAPOR OVER MO...AND THIS MATCHES UP WELL 
WITH THE ETA/AVN MODELS.  SOME SHOWERS HAVE BEEN DYNAMICALLY INDUCED 
IN THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY EARLY THIS AM...BUT THIS IS EXPECTED 
TO WEAKEN AS THE S/WV PUSHES TOWARD THE MIDDLE OHIO VLY BY SUNRISE.  
ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS (WAA) AT 305 K (NEAR 600 MB) AND 310 K (NEAR 300 
MB) VERIFY THE MID AND HIGH CLOUDS BEING GENERATED BY THE S/WV.  
USING ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS AND CURRENT BACK EDGE OF AS/AC DECK NEAR 
SRN IL...THE BACK EDGE OF THE MID LVL CLOUD DECK (BTWN 13K FT AND 
15 K FEET) SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE WAP/DAY/CVG REGIONS BETWEEN 11 AM 
AND 1 PM.  FOR POINTS FARTHER EAST...INCLUDING CMH AND PMH...THE 
BACK EDGE SHOULD MOVE THROUGH BETWEEN 1 PM AND 2 PM.  WITH THAT 
SAID...MOST AREAS SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY THROUGH 
EARLY TO MID AFTN...THEN CLEARING SHOULD TAKE PLACE.  THE ONLY FLY 
IN THE OINTMENT WILL BE FOR SOUTH CNTRL OHIO/N CNTRL KY WHERE 
ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS INDICATES WAA ON THE 290 K SFC (NEAR 5K FT) 
DEVELOPING INTO THIS REGION DURING THE LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTN 
HOURS.  IF THIS ENDS UP DEVELOPING A SC/CUMULUS DECK INTO THIS 
REGION...IT MAY REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY EVEN THROUGH MID AFTN THERE.  
WITH THIS SOMEWHAT IN QUESTION AND FOR TRANSITION SAKE FROM WRN 
ZONES TO EASTERN ZONES...WILL PLACE BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE 
EAST FOR THIS AFTN.  TEMPS ARE TRICKY AND CLOUD DEPENDENT.  USING 
ALL TEMPERATURE FCSTING METHODS (SOUNDINGS/1000-850 MB 
THICKNESS)...I AM COMING UP WITH VALUES CLOSE TO THE MOS 
GUIDANCE...SO WILL NOT STRAY TO FAR FROM THESE.  THE COOLEST TEMPS 
TODAY WILL BE ACRS S CNTRL OHIO AND N CNTRL KY.

FOR TONIGHT...SKIES SHOULD BE MAINLY CLEAR.  A COLD FRONT...NOW OVER 
THE NRN PLAINS STATES...WILL DIVE SE TOWARD THE SRN GREAT LAKES 
REGION BY MORNING.  MODELS SHOW ASSOCD UPR LVL S/WV WEAKENING AS IT 
MOVES EAST...AND THUS THE FRONT WEAKENS ALSO.  MID LVL RIDGING ALSO 
BEGINS TO OCCUR OVER THE OHIO VLY ON SUNDAY.  AS A RESULT...THE SRN 
TAIL OF THE COLD FRONT SHOULD STALL OUT ACRS THE SRN GREAT LAKES.  
ATTM...PREFER THE ETA MODEL SOLUTION WHICH IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH 
850 MB WAA INTO OUR REGION FOR SUNDAY THAN AVN.  ALSO...THE 850 MB 
MSTR IS MUCH DRIER ON THE ETA.  ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS NEAR THE 700 MB 
LVL INDICATES THAT ANY AC THAT DEVELOPS INVOF OF STALLED OUT FRONT 
SHOULD STAY MOSTLY NORTH OF THE REGION.  SOME SCT AC MAY SNEAK INTO 
THE NRN ZONES...BUT BELIEVE MOSTLY SUNNY FCST WILL SUFFICE ALL 
LOCATIONS.  NGM MOS NUMBERS LOOK GOOD FOR SUNDAY...SO WILL ONLY 
TWEAK JUST A BIT.

THE WEATHER FCST BECOMES COMPLICATED ONCE AGAIN FOR MONDAY.
AVN/ETA ALL INDICATE TWO POSSIBLE AREAS FOR MCS DEVELOPMENT SUNDAY 
NIGHT ACRS THE WRN GREAT LAKES AND THE MID MS VLY.  THE 
ETA...HOWEVER...TRIES TO MERGE THE TWO SEPARATE AREAS WHILE THE AVN 
KEEPS THEM SEPARATE.  IT STILL LOOKS LIKE WHAT EVER IS LEFT OVER 
WILL DRIFT INTO OUR REGION DURING MONDAY MORNING INTO THE AFTN.  
THUS...WILL KEEP CHC OF SHOWERS/TSTMS.  WILL ALSO KEEP LOWER TO MID 
70S WORDING FOR HIGHS.  HOWEVER...IF CONVECTIVE DEBRIS BLOW IS THICK 
AND THE SHOWERS/TSTMS ARE MORE WIDESPREAD...IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT 
HIGHS MAY NOT MAKE IT OUT OF THE MID 60S.

TRICKY FORECAST OVERNIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES OFF TO THE EAST. 
GRADIENT WILL BE LIGHT AT FIRST BUT THEN TIGHTEN FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST. IN ADDITION MID LEVEL CLOUDS FROM APPROACHING SHORT WAVE 
SHOULD SPREAD INTO THE AREA WITH THE CLOUDS BEING MORE EXTENSIVE FOR 
SOUTHERN AREAS. TEMPERATURES AND CHANCE FOR FROST WILL BE MAIN 
CONCERN. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE TEMPERATURES FALL RATHER 
QUICKLY EARLY ON ESPECIALLY IN EASTERN ZONES AND BOTTOM OUT SHORTLY 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. THEN WITH THE INCREASE IN WIND AND CLOUDS 
TEMPERATURES WOULD START TO RISE SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE DAYBREAK. 
GIVEN THIS EXPECT AT LEAST PATCHY FROST FOR NORTHEAST ZONES. FROST 
MAY BE A LITTLE MORE WIDESPREAD TO THE EAST OF COLUMBUS SO WILL 
ISSUE A FROST ADVISORY THERE. 

OTHERWISE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF WEATHER THROUGH THE WEEKEND. LOOKS 
LIKE SYSTEM WILL PASS TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA TOMORROW ALTHOUGH 
COULD NOT RULE OUT A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS MAKING IT INTO SOUTH CENTRAL 
OHIO. BUT CHANCE LOOKS TOO LOW TO MENTION IN THE FORECAST. NEXT 
FRONT APPROACHING FOR THE NORTHERN STREAM SHOULD STALL OUT TO THE 
NORTH OF THE AREA. ATMOSPHERE SEEMS TOO DRY FOR ANY PRECIPITATION

COOL START TO THE MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED OVER THE OHIO

LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY PUSHING ACRS AREAS NEAR THE OHIO RIVER.  
EXPECT SOME CI WILL REMAIN ACRS CVG AND PMH ZONES TODAY AS 06Z ETA 
KEEPS UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE IN THESE AREAS THROUGH THIS EVENING.  12Z 
ILN SOUNDING INDICATING A LITTLE MOISTURE AT AROUND 800 MB AND THIS 
MAY BE ENOUGH TO SQUEEZE OUT A FEW CU ACRS THE CWA THIS AFTN.  ALL 
IN ALL...CLOUD DEVELOPMENT WILL DO LITTLE TO DETER SUNSHINE.

REGION WILL STAY IN NW FLOW THIS AFTN WITH HIGH MOVING SLOWLY ACRS 
AREA.  ENERGY BLOCK METHOD GIVES HI OF 60 WITH FULL SUN AND LOW LVL 
THICKNESS TECHNIQUES SUPPORT THIS.  AREAS OF FROST AGAIN POSSIBLE 
TONIGHT...PRIMARILY SOUTH AND EAST OF CMH IN NORMAL COOL SPOTS.  ALL

THANKS TO CLE FOR COORD ON LOWS TONIGHT.

CANNOT ARGUE WITH GUIDANCE NUMBERS ON TEMPS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL

JUMP IN HIGHS ACROSS THE BOARD. DID NOT WANT TO GO WITH ADVISORY IN 
2ND PERIOD FOR FROST IN CMH GROUPING...BUT WILL MENTION POSSIBILITY 
OF PATCHY FROST IN PROTECTED AREAS. THINKING HERE IS THAT WIND ONLY 
DIES OFF BRIEFLY...AND RADIATIONAL COOLING REALLY DOESNT KICK IN 
WITH SOME WEAK WAA SETTING UP BETWEEN 6 AND 12Z. 

HAVE TO REMOVE POPS FROM FRI NITE THROUGH SAT NITE AS ANY CHANCE OF 
PRECIP LOOKS A GOOD BIT LESS THAN 30 PERCENT...AND TYPE WOULD BE 
LIGHT RAIN VS THUNDERSTORMS. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHUNT QPF TO THE 
SOUTH WITH HIGH PRESSURE KEEPING MOISTURE AT BAY. DO NOT EXPECT TO 
BRING IN NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN UNTIL MONDAY. I SEE THE LEADING EDGE OF

VAPOR AND IN THE AVN MODEL NEAR S CNTRL IN...WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR THE

CONVECTION HAS SHOWN A PROGRESSION TO THE SOUTH AND EAST.  WILL MAKE 
A LAST MINUTE DECISION ON WHETHER TO KEEP SOME POPS FOR THE CVG 
GROUP AND PMH GROUP.

THE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE 
REGION THIS EVENING AS MUCH DRIER AIR WORKS IN FROM THE NW.  THIS 
WILL ALLOW SKIES TO GRADUALLY CLEAR OVERNIGHT AND WINDS WILL BECOME 
LIGHT LATE TONIGHT AS THE SFC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS SETS UP NEAR

BE ABLE TO DETERMINE IF THE ADVISORY NEEDS TO BE EXTENDED IN THE 
CVG/PMH GROUPS DEPENDING ON HOW FAST THE DRYING/CLEARING MOVES ACRS 
THE CWFA.

MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ARE EXPECTED ON FRIDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS 
OVER THE REGION.  USING SOUNDING AND THICKNESS TECHNIQUES...MOS 
VALUES LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STICK CLOSE.

ALL MODELS INDICATE THAT A S/WV WILL APCH THE MIDDLE OHIO VLY BY

WILL BE CLOUD DEPENDENT.  WILL STICK CLOSE TO THE MOS GUIDANCE ATTM.

A WEAK COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE REGION SATURDAY

MAY OCCUR.  WILL PLACE A 30 POP IN ALL LOCATIONS.  THE FRONT STALLS

SHOULD FALL OFF EVERYWHERE BY AFTERNOON.  PATCHY FROST MAY BE 
POSSIBLE FOR CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FCST AREA.  GENERAL MODEL/GUIDANCE

ALTHOUGH AVIATION LOOKS A LITTLE FAST PROBABLY DUE TO CONVECTIVE 
FEEDBACK OVERDEEPENING THE SURFACE LOW. WARM FRONT FORECAST TO LIFT

EXPECT STORMS TO SWEEP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT WITH 
POSSIBLY TWO WAVES OF ACTIVITY. ONE WITH CELLS DEVELOPING ALONG THE 
WARM FRONT AND IN THE WARM SECTOR AND THE OTHER POSSIBLY WITH A 
SQUALL LINE FORCED BY THE COLD FRONT. RATHER GOOD WIND FIELDS SHOULD

WATER VALUES THE STORMS COULD PRODUCE HEAVY RAIN. BUT EXPECT THEM TO 
BE PROGRESSIVE SO WILL NOT ISSUE A WATCH. HOWEVER WITH VERY MOIST 
GROUND AND LOW FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES WILL HAVE TO MONITOR 
POSSIBILITY OF FLOODING.

THERE COULD BE SOME LINGERING PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST

TEMPERATURES BOTH FOR OVERNIGHT LOWS AND DAYTIME HIGHS. MAY BE A

MAIN FCST PROBLEM IS THE NEXT LOW TO APPROACH THE OHVLY. MODELS ARE 
SLOWLY COMING TO A CONSENSUS AND TRENDING TOWARDS THE AVN SOLUTION. 
WENT WITH THE AVN SOLUTION YESTERDAY AND DPROG/DT OVER SEVERAL RUNS 
LOOKS VERY CONSISTENT. WILL CONTINUE TO USE THE AVN AS MAIN DRIVING 
FORCE FOR MEAN FIELDS.

FOR TEMPS...NO BIG CHANGES EXPECTED...THOUGH LEANED ABOUT 8-10 
DEGREES COOLER THAN FWC TOWARDS AVN GUIDANCE FOR THURSDAY. HIGHS IN 
THE LOW TO MID 70S SEEM UNREALISTIC AFTER PRECIP AND FROPA. WENT LOW 
TO MID 60S...FROM NW TO SE AND WILL INCLUDE FALLING TEMPS DURING THE 
DAY. WIND KEEPS UP OVERNIGHT...BUT CAA IS FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT AND 30S 
LOOK REASONABLE FOR LOWS BY FRI AM. 

AFTER THE H5 TROF EXITS NE OF FCST AREA BY FRIDAY MORNING...ZONAL 
FLOW IS SHOWN BY EXTENDED MODELS THROUGH THE END OF THE FCST PERIOD.
SPAGHETTI PLOTS ARE CONSISTENT OVER CONUS FOR THE EXTENDED...BUT ARE 
ALL OVER THE PLACE IN THE PACIFIC. SFC HI BUILDS SW OF FCST AREA 
FRIDAY AND TRACKS EAST WITH RIDGE OVER CWA BY 0Z SAT. WAA TO SET UP 
FOR THE WEEKEND AND A LOW OVER THE PLAINS SHOULD START AFFECTING US 
WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY.

MRF HAS A LOW TRACK OVER CWA EARLY MONDAY AND THEN MAINTAINS A LOW 
PRESSURE CENTER OVER THE GREAT PLAINS FOR THE EARLY PART OF THE 
WEEK...POSSIBLY EXTENDING A FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO THE OHVLY. WILL 
KEEP PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
FOR LAST 2 DAYS...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW OUT THIS FAR. ZONAL FLOW 
WOULD SUGGEST A FEW IMPULSES MOVING THROUGH CWA LATE IN THE FCST

WILL REMOVE POPS TONIGHT WITH EXCEPTION OF A SPRINKLE IN THE 
NORTHWEST. SHOWERS TOMORROW LOOK MORE STRATIFORM THAN 
CONVECTIVE...SO WILL MENTION LIGHT RAIN INSTEAD. TEMPS LOOK OKAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE OF AVN/MOS ON HIGHS 
WITH FRONT ENTERING. AM THINKING COOLER WITH PRECIP...BUT AVN WANTS 
TO WARM SECTOR SRN FCST AREA. THIS IS A REAL POSSIBILITY.

TUES PM INTO WED HAS A LARGE AMOUNT OF QPF ALONG WMFNT JUST S OF 
FCST AREA. AVN IS SIGNIFICANTLY FURTHER S THAN ETA...AND MODELERS 
PREFER THE MORE NORTHERLY SOLUTION OF THE ETA. HOWEVER...FROM EITHER 
MODELS...NRN EDGE OF QPF JUST SKIMS SRN FCST AREA. CURRENT FCST HAS 
50 POPS OVER THE N WITH A CONVERGENT BOUNDARY HERE AND 40 POPS IN 
THE SOUTH WITH THE WMFNT. TRACKS DIVERGE HERE...BUT BEST CHANCE FOR 
PRECIP SHOULD BE IN THE WEST...ESPECIALLY SOUTHWEST. 

ETA SEEMS TO VEER AWAY FROM AVN/UKMET WED PM INTO THE LATTER 
PERIODS. H5 TROF ON ETA FROM 12Z THURS TO 0Z FRI SEEMS ABOUT 3 TO 
400 MILES FURTHER EAST THAN IT SHOULD BE. WILL TREND TOWARDS AVNS 
SOLUTION OF MASS FIELDS AT THE SFC AND DISCOUNT THE ETA SOLUTION 
AFTER 60 HOURS (WED PM). ETA BRINGS SFC LOW AS A WMFNT OVER SRN FCST 
AREA AND INDICATES HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL. AVN AND OTHERS WANT TO 
TRACK THE LOW NW OF FCST AREA AND SPIN IT UP. THIS ALSO BRINGS IN 
PRECIP AT THE SAME TIME FRAME BUT PLACES HIGHES QPF FURTHER NORTH. 
CURRENT FCST HAS 50 POPS WITH THUNDER...WILL BUMP TO LIKELY HERE.

NOT EXPECTING WRAP AROUND AS DRY SLOT MAINTAINS ITSELF OVER FCST 
AREA THURSDAY AND THEN HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN TO THE WEST ON 
FRIDAY. GOOD CAA EXPECTED THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...BUT HIGH MIGHT ALLOW 
SUN TO OFFSET THIS FRIDAY. WILL BE COOLER THAN GUIDANCE THURSDAY AND 
A LITTLE WARMER ON FRIDAY. WAA SETS UP FOR THE WEEKEND AS WE RETURN 
TO MORE NORMAL HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S. BY SUNDAY...MRF 
DROPS A BOUNDARY OVER FCST AREA ALTHOUGH KEEPS DAYTIME HIGHS ON THE

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES GOOD SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF

SHOWERS SPREADING INTO FA.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES EXTENSIVE 
CLOUD COVER OVER OHIO AND MUCH OF MS VLY.  WATER VAPOR IMAGERY 
SHOWING SIGNIFICANT JET STREAK PUSHING INTO MO.

COMPLICATED FORECAST.  THANKFULLY MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT.  
THE ETA IS A TOUCH SLOWER THAN LAST RUN AND AVN A BIT FASTER.  THE 
ETA/UKMET ARE A TOUCH SLOWER THAN THE AVN THIS RUN.  WILL GO WITH 
THE ETA/UKMET AND CONCERNED THAT IT MIGHT BE A BIT SLOWER THAN THESE 
RUNS.

WARM FRONT WILL PUSH INTO FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING AS LOW 
CONTINUES TO DEEPEN OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.  TEMPERATURES 
WILL RISE OVERNIGHT AS FA GETS INTO WARM SECTOR.  CURRENT...THINKING 
IS THAT CONVECTION (LIKELY SQUALL LINE) OVER THE MID MS VLY WILL 
SPREAD RAPIDLY INTO OHIO VALLEY WITH THE AID OF 70 TO 80 KTS OF MID

TRANSLATING TO THE SURFACE.  IT IS ALSO TOUGH TO GAUGE SEVERITY 
SINCE ACTIVITY HASNT EVEN DEVELOPED YET.  WILL THROW IN SEVERE 
MENTION AFTER MIDNIGHT SINCE SYNOPTICALLY EVERYTHING APPEARS TO FALL

308 PM EDT FRI APR 26 2002

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES WEAK HIGH PRESSURE OVER FA.  SATELLITE 
IMAGERY DEPICTS MID/HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST.  WATER 
VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES STRONG WAVE MOVING INTO SOUTHWEST U.S.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT (BOTH RUN TO RUN AND COMPARATIVELY) 
WITH SYNOPTIC PATTERN.  LOW WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
TONIGHT AND MOVE INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY SATURDAY 
EVENING.  VIGOROUS WARM FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS FA SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON/EVENING BRINGING STRONG ACCENT WHICH WILL RESULT IN PLENTY 
OF SHOWERS OVER THE REGION.  FA WORKS INTO WARM SECTOR OVERNIGHT.  
WILL KEEP MENTION OF THUNDER OUT OF FORECAST UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT 
WHEN POSITIVE CAPE AND LIS ADVECT INTO FA.  VERTICLE SHEAR WILL BE 
IMPRESSIVE WITH GREATER THAN 35 M/S EXPECTED OVERNIGHT.  BELIEVE 
THERE WILL BE ONE OR TWO ROUND OF THUNDERSTORMS AND THE SEVERITY 
WILL ALL DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY THAT CAN BE ADVECTED 
IN.  COLD FRONT LAYS OUT NEAR I-71 BY 18Z AND CONTINUES TO DRIFT 
SOUTH DURING THE AFTERNOON.  ETA PROGS SOME DESCENT INSTABILITY 
(>2000 J/KG) ALONG WITH SOME RESPECTABLE SHEAR (30 M/S).  AS A 
RESULT WILL UP POPS ON SUNDAY FOR LEFT OVER MORNING CONVECTION AND 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE COLD FRONT.  IT MAY LINGER INTO SUNDAY EVENING 
BUT WILL LEAVE DRY FOR NOW.

FWC TEMPS LOOK PRETTY GOOD.  THE ONLY REAL VARIANCE WILL COME 
SATURDAY NIGHT WHERE WILL BUMP UP CVG AND CMH A CAT WITH STRONG 
WAA.

SFC ANALYSIS THIS MORNING DEPICTED A WARM FRONT FROM THE GULF COAST 
STATES NW INTO THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY...THEN INTO NE OKLA.  
ALSO...A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM NW MN...SW INTO ERN SD...THEN 
INTO NW NEBRASKA.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AM ABOUT THE AFOREMENTIONED 
SYNOPTIC FEATURES.  THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MODELS FROM YESTERDAY ATTM 
IS THE PLACEMENT OF THE CURRENT ELEVATED CONVECTION LOCATED FROM 
SRN...MO...SRN IL INTO CNTRL TN.  ETA MODEL YESTERDAY HAD SOME OF 
THIS CONVECTION MOVING TOWARD OUR SWRN CWFA...AND THE CONCERN WAS 
FOR MCS BLOW OFF DEBRIS AFFECTING THE TEMPS.  CURRENT ETA MODEL RUN 
HAS BACKED OFF ON THIS...AND MODEL DATA SHOWS THAT THE 850 MB TO 300 
MB THERMAL WIND SHOULD KEEP THIS CONVECTION MOVING IN A SE DIRECTION 
THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS.  MID LVL (700 MB) FCST WINDS MAY BRING 
SOME AC INTO OUR SWRN AREAS DURING THE FIRST FEW HOURS AFTER 
SUNRISE...BUT INSOLATION SHOULD HELP EAT AWAY AT THIS.  WITH THAT 
SAID...A GOOD PORTION OF THE DAY SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY SUNNY ACRS THE 
REGION.  AS A RESULT...WILL GO CLOSE OR SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN MOS 
GUIDANCE.  THE COLD FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED FROM A ERN WISC...WRN 
IL...CNTRL MO...ERN OKLA LINE BY 5 PM (21Z) WITH THE GULF COAST WARM 
FRONT LOCATED FROM SRN IL...SW IND...TO WRN KY.  A DEVELOPING 850 MB 
JET FOCUSED TOWARD OUR CWFA BY LATE AFTN MAY CAUSE SOME ELEVATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BREAK OUT ACRS THE SWRN CWFA BETWEEN 5 
PM AND 8 PM.  THEN...AS THE WHOLE SYSTEM MERGES OVER THE CWFA 
BETWEEN 8 PM AND MIDNIGHT...WIDESPREAD SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED ACRS THE 
ENTIRE REGION.  THE GREATEST CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE 
EVENING HOURS SHOULD BE ACRS THE SOUTH WHERE SBCAPES WILL BE THE 
HIGHEST SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT.  THE FRONT QUICKLY MOVES THRU THE 
WRN CWFA BETWEEN 11 PM AND 1 AM AND THE ERN CWFA BETWEEN 1 AM AND 4 
AM.  STRONG CAA AND DRYING WILL ALLOW SKIES TO CLEAR QUICKLY.  
ALSO...FCST 40 KT WINDS AT 925 MB WILL BRING ABOUT A 2 TO 3 HOUR 
PERIOD OF WINDY CONDITIONS AS SOME OF THIS WIND IS BROUGHT DOWN TO 
THE SFC VIA MOMENTUM TRANSFER.  WITH SOILS STILL SATURATED...THERE 
IS A CONCERN FOR SOME FLOODING ACRS THE SRN CWFA THIS EVENING.  THE 
EVENT WILL BE A QUICK ONE...AND WOULD LIKE TO DELEGATE THE FINE 
TUNING OF A WATCH TO THE DAY SHIFT AS THEY SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TIME 
TO PINPOINT THE BEST AREA...IF NEEDED.  NGM MOS TEMPS ARE NOW CLOSE 
TO AVN MOS GUIDANCE FOR THURSDAY MORNING LOWS...AND THESE LOOK 
REASONABLE.

MUCH COOLER AIR WILL ONCE AGAIN INVADE THE REGION ON THURSDAY BEHIND 
THE COLD FRONT.  LOCAL CUMULUS CLOUD METHODS INDICATE ONLY SCT 
DAYTIME CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT FOR THURSDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A 
MOSTLY SUNNY FORECAST.  SKIES SHOULD BE MAINLY CLEAR THURSDAY 
NIGHT.  OVERNIGHT LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE 
WIND.  WILL STICK CLOSE TO MOS TEMPS AS ETA MODEL BRINGS SFC RIDGE 
AXIS ACRS THE WRN AND SRN CWFA BY FRIDAY MORNING.

ALSO...A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM NW MN...SW INTO ERN SD...THEN 
INTO NW NEBRASKA.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AM ABOUT THE AFOREMENTIONED 
SYNOPTIC FEATURES.  THE DIFFERENCE IN THE MODELS FROM YESTERDAY ATTM 
IS THE PLACEMENT OF THE CURRENT ELEVATED CONVECTION LOCATED FROM 
SRN...MO...SRN IL INTO CNTRL TN.  ETA MODEL YESTERDAY HAD SOME OF 
THIS CONVECTION MOVING TOWARD OUR SWRN CWFA...AND THE CONCERN WAS 
FOR MCS BLOW OFF DEBRIS AFFECTING THE TEMPS.  CURRENT ETA MODEL RUN 
HAS BACKED OFF ON THIS...AND MODEL DATA SHOWS THAT THE 850 MB TO 300 
MB THERMAL WIND SHOULD KEEP THIS CONVECTION MOVING IN A SE DIRECTION 
THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS.  MID LVL (700 MB) FCST WINDS MAY BRING 
SOME AC INTO OUR SWRN AREAS DURING THE FIRST FEW HOURS AFTER 
SUNRISE...BUT INSOLATION SHOULD HELP EAT AWAY AT THIS.  WITH THAT 
SAID...A GOOD PORTION OF THE DAY SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY SUNNY ACRS THE 
REGION.  AS A RESULT...WILL GO CLOSE OR SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN MOS 
GUIDANCE.  THE COLD FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED FROM A ERN WISC...WRN 
IL...CNTRL MO...ERN OKLA LINE BY 5 PM (21Z) WITH THE GULF COAST WARM 
FRONT LOCATED FROM SRN IL...SW IND...TO WRN KY.  A DEVELOPING 850 MB 
JET FOCUSED TOWARD OUR CWFA BY LATE AFTN MAY CAUSE SOME ELEVATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BREAK OUT ACRS THE SWRN CWFA BETWEEN 5 
PM AND 8 PM.  THEN...AS THE WHOLE SYSTEM MERGES OVER THE CWFA 
BETWEEN 8 PM AND MIDNIGHT...WIDESPREAD SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED ACRS THE 
ENTIRE REGION.  THE GREATEST CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE 
EVENING HOURS SHOULD BE ACRS THE SOUTH WHERE SBCAPES WILL BE THE 
HIGHEST SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT.  THE FRONT QUICKLY MOVES THRU THE 
WRN CWFA BETWEEN 11 PM AND 1 AM AND THE ERN CWFA BETWEEN 1 AM AND 4 
AM.  STRONG CAA AND DRYING WILL ALLOW SKIES TO CLEAR QUICKLY.  
ALSO...FCST 40 KT WINDS AT 925 MB WILL BRING ABOUT A 2 TO 3 HOUR 
PERIOD OF WINDY CONDITIONS AS SOME OF THIS WIND IS BROUGHT DOWN TO 
THE SFC VIA MOMENTUM TRANSFER.  WITH SOILS STILL SATURATED...THERE 
IS A CONCERN FOR SOME FLOODING ACRS THE SRN CWFA THIS EVENING.  THE 
EVENT WILL BE A QUICK ONE...AND WOULD LIKE TO DELEGATE THE FINE 
TUNING OF A WATCH TO THE DAY SHIFT AS THEY SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH TIME 
TO PINPOINT THE BEST AREA...IF NEEDED.  NGM MOS TEMPS ARE NOW CLOSE 
TO AVN MOS GUIDANCE FOR THURSDAY MORNING LOWS...AND THESE LOOK 
REASONABLE.

MUCH COOLER AIR WILL ONCE AGAIN INVADE THE REGION ON THURSDAY BEHIND 
THE COLD FRONT.  LOCAL CUMULUS CLOUD METHODS INDICATE ONLY SCT 
DAYTIME CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT FOR THURSDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A 
MOSTLY SUNNY FORECAST.  SKIES SHOULD BE MAINLY CLEAR THURSDAY 
NIGHT.  OVERNIGHT LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT WILL BE DEPENDENT ON THE 
WIND.  WILL STICK CLOSE TO MOS TEMPS AS ETA MODEL BRINGS SFC RIDGE 
AXIS ACRS THE WRN AND SRN CWFA BY FRIDAY MORNING.

.ILN...NONE.

SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING CONTINUES TO SHOW A DECREASE IN THE 
STRATOCUMLUS CLOUDS.  I EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE THROUGH 
SUNRISE AS SKIES SHOULD BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR BY THEN.  HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER INDIANA WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST ACRS THE MID OHIO VLY 
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.  OTHER THAN SOME CUMULUS REGENERATION 
WITH DAYTIME HEATING AND A FEW TUFFS OF CIRRUS FROM CONVECTIVE BLOW 
OFF FROM THE CNTRL PLAINS...SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY.

FOR TONIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE IS FCST TO SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST AS AN 
EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW TAKES OVER.  SKIES SHOULD STAY MOSTLY CLEAR 
FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE NIGHT...UNTIL THE FIRST BUGABOO OF THE 
FCST TAKES PLACE.  AVN/ETA ARE SIMILAR IN DEVELOPING ELEVATED 
CONVECTION OVER THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY LATE TONIGHT...TAKING ITS 
REMAINS EASTWARD INTO CNTRL KENTUCKY DURING WEDNESDAY MORNING.  THE 
BLOW OFF FROM THIS CONVECTION WILL LIKELY SPREAD NORTHEAST (WITH THE 
MID LVL WIND FLOW) INTO OUR SWRN CWFA BY SUNRISE WEDNESDAY MORNING.  
THEN...THE BLOW OFF COULD STICK AROUND FOR AWHILE DURING THE MORNING 
HOURS UNTIL ENOUGH SUNSHINE AND GRADUAL DISSIPATION OF THE MCS 
OCCURS...BRINGING PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS TO THE CWFA FOR THE AFTN 
HOURS.  THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT SOME OF THE SHOWER ACTIVITY 
COULD SKIM OUR FAR SWRN CWFA DURING WEDNESDAY MORNING...BUT WILL 
LEAVE DRY ATTM AS EXACT MCS DEVELOPMENT AREA CAN BE TRICKY BASED ON 
THE MODELS.  

A STRONG...VIGOROUS S/WV IS EXPECTED TO DIVE SE FROM THE NRN ROCKIES 
INTO THE PLAINS ON WEDNESDAY...SWEEPING A SFC COLD FRONT THROUGH OUR 
REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  AN INCREASING SOUTHERLY FLOW OF 
WARM...MOIST AIR ALONG WITH DYNAMICAL LIFT WILL LIKELY DEVELOP A 
SQUALL LINE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT ACRS IL/IN WEDNESDAY AFTN.  THIS 
LINE WILL PROBABLY MAKE IT TO OUR WRN CWFA BEFORE WEAKENING AS IT 
MOVES INTO OUR AREA AT AN UNFAVORABLE TIME (TOWARD EVENING WHEN 
SBCAPES BEGIN TO DECREASE).  EITHER WAY...SHOWERS WILL BE A GOOD BET 
ALONG WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS.  STRONG CAA BEHIND THE FRONT WILL 
CLEAR SKIES QUICKLY AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE...LEAVING MOSTLY CLEAR 
CONDITIONS BY THURSDAY AT DAYBREAK.  SKIES WILL THEN BECOME PARTLY 
CLOUDY ON THURSDAY AS 850 MB MSTR INCREASES AND CAA AND DAYTIME 
HEATING DEVELOP AFTERNOON CUMULUS CLOUDS.

MOS TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WENT A LITTLE 
WARMER ON WEDNESDAY.  HIGHS TOMORROW WILL BE HIGHLY CLOUD DEPENDENT 
BASED ON CLOUD COVERAGE FROM MCS BLOW OFF.  IF CLOUDS DO NOT END UP 
AS WIDESPREAD OR AS HICK...TEMPS MAY BE A CATEGORY HIGHER THAN 
CURRENT THINKING.  STRONG CAA WEDNESDAY NIGHT SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO 
DROP INTO THE 40 TO 45 DEGREE RANGE.  WILL SIDE WITH THE AVN MOS FOR

ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED AS THE LOW PASSES 
BY.  PCPN SHOULD END WITH PASSAGE OF LOW.

ETA IS STRONGEST WITH A VORT DROPPING INTO NORTHERN OHIO ON MONDAY.  
THIS COULD KICK OFF SCATTERED SHOWERS...SO WILL KEEP THE RAIN 
SHOWERS IN THE NORTH.  1000-850 THICKNESS ARE ABOVE 1300 SO WONT

SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CU NEAR FRONT.  CU IS ALSO ENHANCED BY 
LAKE BREEZE OF LAKE MI.

ETA AND AVN ARE IN PRETTY DESCENT AGREEMENT.  THE ONLY BIG 
DIFFERENCE IS THE AVN PUSHES THE COLD FRONT FARTHER SOUTH ON 
SATURDAY WHERE THE ETA HANGS IT JUST SOUTH OF FA.  SINCE ETA HAS 
BETTER HANDLE ON LOWER LEVELS AND DIFFERENCE IS RATHER MINOR FROM A

MORNING.  WITH THE FRONT JUST TO OUR SOUTH WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS 
GOING ALL DAY ACROSS NORTHERN KY AND FAR SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO.  LESSER

TO THE UPPER FLOW.  THE SECOND SHORT WAVE WILL ALSO ACT TO SLOW THE 
FRONTS PROGRESS ON FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT.  THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF 
THE FRONT WILL ALLOW PLENTY OF TIME FOR MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM THE

SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL MORPH TO A MORE WESTERLY DIRECTION BY 
FRIDAY IN RESPONSE TO THREE SHORT WAVES.  FIRST SHORT WAVE IS DUE TO 
ARRIVE EARLY THIS AFTERNOON.  SECOND SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO ARRIVE 
ON THURSDAY...AND THE THIRD WILL AFFECT OUR CWA ON FRIDAY. 

SFC MAP HAS HIGH OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST...WITH LOW PRESSURE OVER 
SOUTH-CENTRAL CANADA TRAILING A COLD FRONT INTO IOWA.  FRONT IS 
PROGGED TO WASH OUT AS IT MOVES EAST INTO THE HIGH.  HOWEVER...A
SFC TROF IS EVIDENT ON MODELS AT 18Z TODAY AS THE FIRST SHORT 
WAVE ARRIVES.   

WEAK RIDGING WILL THEN FOLLOW THE SFC TROF TONIGHT...BEFORE A WARM 
FRONT SETS UP IN ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON THURSDAY AHEAD OF A LOW 
OVER MINNESOTA.  AFTER THAT THE LOW IS FCST TO MOVE INTO SOUTHEAST 
CANADA AND TRAIL A COLD FRONT INTO NORTHWEST OHIO AT 12Z ON 
FRIDAY...WITH ETA AND AVN IN GOOD AGREEMENT REGARDING THE FRONTS 
PLACEMENT.  

WITH SHORT WAVE ARRIVING AMIDST GOOD INSTABILITY AND SOME SFC 
CONVERGENCE EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...ILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR TSRA 
TODAY...WITH LINGERING CHANCE THIS EVENING IN OUR EASTERN ZONES.  
THOUGH SFC CONVERGENCE IS WEAK...ILL KEEP CHANCE POPS ON THURSDAY 
WITH ARRIVAL OF SECOND SHORT WAVE ALONG WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND 
LI DOWN TO MINUS 8.  

FRONT ARRIVING EARLY FRIDAY MORNING WILL PROVIDE BEST CHANCE FOR 
TSRA.  HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR FRIDAY WITH FRONT PROGGED TO 
BECOME NEARLY PARALLEL WITH UPPER FLOW.  WIND FIELDS ARE ALSO FCST 
TO STRENGTHEN BY EARLY FRIDAY AHEAD OF THE FRONT WHICH WILL PROVIDE 
A LIMITED SEVERE POTENTIAL.  WITH MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT...ILL 
RAISE POPS TO 60%.

FWC TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK A BIT TOO COOL THROUGH THE FCST SO ILL 
BUMP THEM UP A COUPLE DEGREES ACROSS THE BOARD.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS AFTN INDICATES THAT A WEAKENING SW/V 
EXTENDS FROM ERN WISC/WRN INDIANA/WRN KY.  VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY 
THIS AFTN SHOWS A LACK OF CUMULUS CLOUDS ACRS W CNTRL OHIO INTO THE 
WRN PARTS OF CNTRL OHIO.  THERE ARE TWO REASONS FOR THIS:  
ONE...THERE IS A MINIMUM OF UPPER 50S DEWPOINTS IN THIS REGION.  
TWO...MSTR FROM THE SFC THROUGH 850 MB IS AT A MINIMUM...WHICH HAS 
BEEN DEPICTED BY THE ETA MODEL.  TO THE WEST AND TO THE EAST OF THIS 
REGION...CUMULUS CLOUDS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING.  IN FACT...THE 
HEALTHIEST CUMULUS IS OVER ERN OHIO WHERE DEEPER MSTR AND 
DIFFERENTIAL HEATING FROM ELEVATED TERRAIN ARE THE MAIN 
INGREDIENTS.  BOTTOM LINE:  STILL BELIEVE WITH S/WV TO OUR WEST AND 
DEEPER MSTR AND DIFFERENTIAL HEATING IN THE ERN CWFA... A SLIGHT CHC 
IS WARRANTED FOR THE EARLY EVENING HOURS IN THE AFOREMENTIONED 
AREA.  ONCE THE SUN GOES DOWN...ANY THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD EVENTUALLY 
DISSIPATE...WITH CLEARING SKIES ON TAP.  OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE MUCH 
ABOVE NORMAL WITH MOST LOCATIONS REMAINING IN THE 60S.

FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY...AGREE WITH THE ETA/AVN MODELS THAT 
COLD FRONT OUT IN THE PLAIN STATES THIS AFTN WILL APCH OUR NRN CWFA 
BY WEDNESDAY EVENING...BUT IT WILL NOT PUSH THROUGH DUE TO STRONG 
RIDGE HOLDING SWAY IN THE ERN U. S. AND ALSO TO DIGGING ENERGY IN 
THE WRN H5 TROUGH.  A S/WV WILL EJECT NE INTO OUR REGION ON 
WEDNESDAY WELL AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  THERE IS A LACK OF LOW LVL CONV 
FROM THE SFC TO 850 MB.  HOWEVER...DEEPER MSTR...DAYTIME HEATING AND 
PVA/DIV ALOFT SHOULD ALLOW FOR SCATTERED AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.  SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LINGER INTO THE 
EVENING HOURS ERN CWFA WEDNESDAY EVENING...THEN SKIES SHOULD BECOME 
MOSTLY CLEAR ALL LOCATIONS.  WITH THE AVN/ETA SOLUTION...WILL GO 
ABOUT A CATEGORY WARMER FOR THE OVERNIGHT LOWS WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

ON THURSDAY...AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE NE AS A WARM FRONT 
INTO THE NRN GREAT LAKES.  VERY WARM...MOIST AIR WILL BE IN PLACE 
ACRS THE OHIO VALLEY.  MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW NO CAPPING INVERSION ON 
THURSDAY.  HOWEVER...THERE IS A LACK OF LOW LEVEL FOCUSING AND  S/WV 
ACTIVITY FOR AIDED LIFT.  AT THIS TIME...BELIEVE A LATE DAY SHOWER 
OR THUNDERSTORM IS POSSIBLE...BUT IT PROBABLY WILL BE ISOLATED.  
WITH 30 POPS MENTIONED ALREADY IN FOR THURSDAY...DO NOT WANT TO YO 
YO AND PLACE A SILENT 20 POP ATTM.  THUS...WILL LEAVE A 30 POP FOR 
LATE THURSDAY AFTN INTO THE EVENING HOURS.  

A MORE SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT APCHES THE REGION BY FRIDAY...BRINGING 
THE BEST CHC FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OF THE WEEK.  
TEMPERATURES WILL LOWER TO MORE LATE APRIL READINGS BY SATURDAY 
AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE.

A STRETCH OF WARM WEATHER WILL CONTINUE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 
WORK WEEK.  WEATHER DISTURBANCES IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
COMBINED WITH FRONTAL SYSTEMS EITHER APCHING OR MOVING THROUGH THE 
CWFA WILL KEEP THE TIMING OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DIFFICULT 
THROUGH THE PERIOD.

VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AFTN SHOWED MANY MOSTLY SUNNY 
CONDITIONS.  EXPECT DIURNAL CUMULUS CLOUDS TO DISSIPATE AFTER 
SUNSET...ALLOWING FOR MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.  WITH DEWPOINTS REMAINING 
IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S...TEMPS SHOW FALL ONLY INTO THE UPPER 
50S TO LOWER 60S BY TUESDAY MORNING.

ALL MODELS HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING A WEAKENING H5 S/WV NOW OVER THE 
TX/OKLA REGION TO MOVE INTO THE WISC/MI REGION BETWEEN 18Z AND 00Z 
TOMORROW.  ALTHOUGH A VORT LOBE TAIL FROM THIS S/WV WILL BRUSH OUR 
REGION...FCST SBCAPES OF 2400 J/KG WITH NO CAP ALONG WITH THIS 
RIPPLE SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO KICK OFF SOME AFTN SHOWERS  AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION.  RIGHT NOW A 30 PERCENT POP 
FOR TUESDAY AFTN AND EVENING STILL LOOKS GOOD.  TEMPERATURES WILL 
AGAIN BE UNSEASONABLY WARM.  WILL ONLY MENTION NEAR RECORD HIGHS IN 
THE CMH GROUP SINCE I WILL FCST A HIGH OF 85 AND THE RECORD IS 86 
FOR APRIL 16TH.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE OUT OF THE PLAINS STATES TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
THEN SLOWLY SAG SOUTH AND EAST ON WEDNESDAY TOWARD THE 
REGION...STALLING OUT AS A STATIONARY FRONT ACRS NRN IL...NRN IN AND 
NRN OH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  AGAIN...A WEAK S/WV IN THE SW FLOW ALOFT 
COMBINED WITH AN UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL BRING A THREAT FOR SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS.  THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT SHOWERS/TSTMS COULD 
LAST ALL NIGHT IN THE NORTH CLOSE TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  WILL 
KEEP CHC THERE ALL NIGHT BUT ONLY EVENING WORDING IN THE SOUTH.

THURSDAY WILL SEE A SMALL THREAT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS 
ANOTHER A WEAK DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE THROUGH. 

A MORE SIGNIFICANT CHC FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS EXPECTED 
FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT AS A MORE SUBSTANTIAL COLD FRONT IS FCST TO 
MOVE THROUGH THE REGION...BRINGING COOLER WEATHER FOR THE WEEKEND.

SBCAPES TONIGHT ARENT TOO IMPRESSIVE...BUT STILL MAINTAIN 400+ IN 
AN AREA WHERE UPPER DIVERGENCE IS FAIRLY STRONG. LIS REMAIN 
NEGATIVE OVER FCST AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT. HAVE SEEN A FAIR 
CORRELATION THIS MORNING WITH ETAS 250MB DIVERGENCE AND WILL KEY ON 
THAT TONIGHT FOR A STRONGER MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS. THIS PUTS 
FOCUS ON THE NORTHWEST QUARTER OF FCST AREA THROUGH 12Z JUST AHEAD 
OF S/W AND UNDER VORT THAT TRACKS THROUGH NRN IND. WILL BUMP THUNDER 
CHANCE TO LIKELY HERE WITH CATEGORICAL POPS. EXPECT TO STAY CLOSER 
TO WARMER FWC NUMBERS TONIGHT. 

FOR TOMORROW...MAJORITY OF FORCING GETS MOVED NORTHEAST OF FCST AREA 
BUT MOISTURE AND SOME INSTABILITY LAGS OVER CWA. AM HOPEFUL THAT 
PRECIP WONT LAST LONG THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS...ESPECIALLY 
NORTHWEST...BUT CANT RULE OUT SHOWERS AND WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE 
WORDING. DAYTIME HIGHS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER IN THE NORTHWEST 
AS READINGS BEHIND CDFNT TODAY ARE STRUGGLING TO GET THROUGH THE 
50S. WILL BREAK HIGHS FROM LOW 60S NW TO LOW 70S SE. 

THOUGH THE FRONT MOVES THORUGHFCST AREA SATURDAY...SOME LINGERING 
SHOWERS BEHIND IT ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE NIGHT AND WILL WORD AS 
SCATTERED WITH A 30 POP EXCEPT FOR 40 IN THE SOUTHEAST. THIS RUNS 
INTO SUNDAY MORNING IN THE SOUTHEAST WHERE LOW CHANCE POPS ARE 
REASONABLE. FWC NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE ON SUNDAY WITH PC SKIES.

EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK SHOULD BE DRY WITH BUILDING H5 RIDGE AHEAD 
OF DEEPING LOW IN THE PLAINS. GULF MOISTURE COMES BACK AND NEXT 
FRONT APPROACHING BY MID WEEK SHOULD WRING OUT SOME SCATTERED 
SHOWERS.

SFC LOW PASSES N OF FCST AREA IN EXTENDED BUT DROPS A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY FROM SW-NE WHICH IS EXPECTED TO BE A FOCUS FOR SHOWERS 
STARTING ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...MRF IS THROWING A HUGE DIURNALLY 
INFLUENCED AREA OF QPF OVER THE SERN 1/3 OF THE U.S. THAT IS LIKELY 
OVERDONE. ID RATHER HOLD OFF MENTION OF PRECIP DURING THE DAY ON 
WEDNESDAY...BUT CURRENT FCST HAS IT IN AND THERE IS ALWAYS TIMING 
ISSUES THIS FAR OUT IN THE FCST. BEGINNING WEDNESDAY...WILL EXPECT 
MOCLOUDY SKIES WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO THE 
BOUNDARY THAT SOWLY MOVES SOUTHEAST OF FCST AREA BY NEXT WEEKEND.

THANKS TO IND SDF AND CRW FOR COORD

TRICKY PART OF FCST WILL BE SHORT TERM AND POSSIBILITY OF AN 
ISOLATED SHOWER BEING SQUEEZED OUT TONIGHT IN FAR WRN FCST AREA. A 
WEAK DISTURBANCE IS RIDING ALONG THE EASTERN MSVLY TOWARDS THE OHVLY 
TONIGHT. COMBINED WITH INCREASED LLVL MOISTURE AND SOME WEAK 
CONVERGENCE...I CANT RULE OUT THE POSSIBILITY. HOWEVER...AFTER 
COORDINATION ILL WAIT UNTIL ISSUANCE TIME TO SEE IF I EVEN WANT TO 
MENTION THIS TONIGHT. IT WILL DEPEND ON WHETHER SOME CONVECTION GETS 
GOING IN WRN KY THIS AFTERNOON AND RIGHT NOW IM LEAVING IT OUT. 

CONTINUING THIS LINE OF THOUGHT...CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AHEAD OF 
APPROACHING SFC FRONT WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY FRIDAY. 
WILL DROP TO A 30 PERCENT CHANCE OVER THE EAST AS THE FRONT 
BASICALLY DIES WEST OF FCST AREA AND THEN BOUNDARY SLOWLY SHIFTS 
EAST OVERNIGHT. WITH THE LEFTOVERS...WILL KEEP NORTHWEST DRY 
SATURDAY AND BUMP UP TO A 40 POP IN THE EAST WITH MORNING WORDING. 
CVG AREA MIGHT SEE A MORNING SHOWER SO 30 POPS HERE. FRONT WITH 
ACTUAL WINDSHIFT MOVES THROUGH FCST AREA SATURDAY...BUT THERES 
REALLY NO COLD AIR BEHIND IT. NEXT WAVE IS ON SUNDAY AS A LOW LEVEL 
DISTURBANCE MOVES IN TO FCST AREA FROM SOUTHWEST. MODELS ARE 
TRENDING WITH A MORE SOUTHERN SOLUTION HERE...AND ILL FALL IN LINE 
AND LOWER THE POPS OVER THE NORTH ON SUNDAY...REMOVING THEM FROM THE 
NORTHWEST.

SEASONABLY MILD CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. 
AFTER THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK TROF LATE SUNDAY...ZONAL W-E FLOW SETS 
UP AS AN H5 LOW STRENGTHENS NORTH OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS IN CANADA. 
THIS ALLOWS RIDGING OVER THE EAST COAST TO STRENGTHEN WITH LITTLE 
ORGANIZED PRECIPITATION ACTIVITY. ON WEDNESDAY...THIS LOW 
EXPERIENCES A SLIGHT NEGATIVE TILT WITH A LOBE SWINGING AROUND ITS 
SOUTHEAST SIDE. THE RIDGE OVER THE EAST COAST STARTS TO BREAK DOWN 
AND BECOMES MORE SW-NE ORIENTED. MEAN FLOW STARTING ON WEDNESDAY 
BECOMES SOUTHWEST AND THE GULF LOOKS TO OPEN UP. THE ACTUAL LONGWAVE 
TROF WITH THIS LOW ISNT PROGGED TO MOVE FROM THE CENTRAL TO EASTERN 
U.S. UNTIL WELL AFTER THE FORECAST PERIOD.

ONE FLY IN THE OINTMENT IN THE EXTENDED MODELS IS THE PACIFIC NW LOW 
THAT GETS BLOWN UP ON THE UKMET/ECMWF WHERE THE MRF/NOGAPS ACTUALLY 
HAS SFC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING AT 0Z WED. ASIDE FROM THIS FEATURE... 
MODELS ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE BREAKDOWN OF THE UPPER RIDGE AND 
APPROACHING SFC FRONT IN THE EASTERN 2/3 OF U.S.  SPAGHETTI PLOTS 
ARE UNAVAILABLE AT THIS TIME OVER THE INTERNET SO WILL JUST CONTINUE 
WITH THE SW FLOW AND INCREASED MOISTURE THINKING FOR FCST AREA FOR 
LAST DAY OR TWO OF FCST. PREEPD SUGGESTS A SLOWER PROGRESSION OF THE 
FRONT OVER OHVLY BY DAY 7 AND WILL CONCUR HERE AND KEEP DAY 6 DRY.

FOR TEMPS...WILL LEAN TOWARDS COOLER AVN TONIGHT BUT FWC LOOKS GOOD 
AFTERWARDS FOR NEXT FEW PERIODS.

SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. SCATTERED SHOWERS CONTINUING ACROSS THE FA AT 
THIS TIME. THIS AREA OF SHOWERS WILL MOVING EAST. SHOWERS HAVE BEEN 
DEVELOPING ALONG/BEHIND THE FRONT THIS AM AND WILL SEE ANOTHER SHOT 
OF SHOWERS AS FRONT MOVES THROUGH TODAY. THE FRONT IS FORECAST TO BE 
IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE FA AROUND 12Z AND WILL MOVE EAST OF CWA 
THIS AFTERNOON. ETA MODEL WAS MODEL OF CHOICE.

NO THUNDER HAS OCCURRED OVERNIGHT. THREAT OF THUNDER LOOKS TO BE LOW 
IN THE WEST AND WILL ONLY MENTION SHOWERS THERE. THERE IS A LITTLE 
BETTER INSTABILITY IN THE EAST JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND WILL 
CONTINUE MENTION OF CHANCE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EAST.

RAINFALL AMOUNTS HAVE HAVE BEEN GENERALLY UNDER AN INCH AND BELOW 
FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE. DO NOT EXPECT RAINFALL TODAY TO CAUSE 
WIDESPREAD FLOODING PROBLEMS...ALTHOUGH MAY SEE SOME ISOLATED 
FLOODING PROBLEMS. WILL DROP FLOOD WATCH WITH THIS MORNINGS 
FORECAST.  

AFTER TODAY...DRIER AIR WILL WORK IN AND WILL SEE A WARM UP IN

KILN SHOWING SNOW EXITING SOUTHERN OHIO.  IT APPEARS THAT ILN GOT 
ABOUT AS GOOD A SHOT AS MOST AND WE ENDED UP WITH A HALF INCH ON 
GRASSY AREAS.  SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES WEAK SFC LOW OVER KY WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO FA.  

MODELS ARE ALL VERY SIMILAR.  SURFACE RIDGE DOMINATES WX TODAY WITH 
COLD AIR ADVECTION (CAA) TURNING TO NEUTRAL BY THE END OF THE DAY.  
THE COMBINATION OF CAA AND A DUSTING TO A HALF INCH OF SNOW WILL 
PROVIDE FOR SOME CU BY LATE MORNING.  AT THE MOMENT...DONT BELIEVE 
THE SKY WILL GO OVERCAST.  IT WILL LIKELY GO BROKEN FOR SEVERAL 
HOURS...BUT THE BALANCE OF THE AFTERNOON SHOULD BE PARTLY CLOUDY.  
SOUTHERLY FLOW AND WARM AIR ADVECTION KICKS IN TONIGHT AND CONTINUES 
THROUGH MONDAY.  AS A RESULT MORE SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES CAN BE 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEK.  NEXT COLD FRONT WILL 
BRING THREAT OF PRECIP IN THE WEST SUNDAY NIGHT AND ACROSS THE WHOLE 
FA ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  THE COLD FRONT FINALLY PASSES TO OUR EAST 
BY TUESDAY NIGHT.

FWC AND MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE.  THE ONLY MENTIONABLE ADJUSTMENT 
WILL BE TO BUMP TEMPS UP 2 TO 3 DEGREES.

20Z VIS SAT SHOWS BKN-OVC SC DECK ACROSS AREA.  CLOUD COVER TONIGHT 
SHOULD KEEP TEMPS SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDANCE ALTHOUGH THERE IS SOME 
DRYING AT 850 MB IN THE WEST FCST AREA BY 12Z.  

12Z ETA MUCH COOLER THAN FWC AND MAV IS SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN FWC FOR 
FRIDAY.  SNDG TECHNIQUES SHOW AIR MASS WILL CONTINUE TO BE RESISTANT 
TO WARMING.  EVEN WITH SOME AFTERNOON SUNSHINE IN WESTERN FCST AREA 
TEMPS SHOULD STAY BELOW 50 AT CVG. WILL STAY CLOSE TO FWC.   

TEMPS REMAIN A PROBLEM FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.  WEAK BOUNDARY 
AFFECTS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL FCST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT.  AVN AND ETA 
SHOW 90+ 850 MB RH BAND IN WEST AT 6Z SATURDAY.  MAY BUMP UP TEMPS 
SLIGHTLY IN CVG.  ETA IS MUCH LOWER AGAIN THAN MAV AND FWC SO WILL

H8 RIDGE IS JUST W OF FCST AREA ON SATURDAY...BUT GOOD NW FLOW AT H5 
SHOULD STREAM IN SOME MID LEVEL CLOUDS. THERES STILL THE CHANCE 
THAT MOISTURE AT H8 AND BELOW NEVER GET OUT OF THE PICTURE THROUGH

PROBLEM ATTM IS CLOUD COVER AT NIGHT. I DIDNT THINK THAT THIS MUCH

OVERNIGHT BUT I STILL THINK THAT THE CLOUDS WILL BE PRESENT. RIGHT 
NOW IM GOING TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AND MENTION PARTLY CLOUDY FOR

CURRENT FCST CHALLENGE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL BE HOW MUCH 
DAYTIME CLOUD COVER IS PRESENT. CURRENTLY THINKING THAT THE NORTH 
AND ESPECIALLY NORTHWEST WILL BE MOCLOUDY FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYTIME PERIODS AS CU DEVELOPS IN H8 COLD AIR POOL. AVIAILABLE 
MOISTURE IS BEST NOTED TO THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST...BUT EVEN 
SOUTHERN FCST AREA SHOULD GET INTO A BROKEN DECK THROUGH FRIDAY. 

THIS WOULD COOL TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE BOARD...BUT POSSIBLY OPEN UP 
A FAIR RANGE FROM NW TO SE AS SERN FCST AREA SHOULD GET INTO THE 
MORE SCATTERED CU FIELD AND HAVE DECENT AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE ON FRIDAY.

H8 RIDGE DOESNT START TO WORK ON THE WX ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL CONTINUE WITH A SLOW WARMING TREND 
THROUGH THE WEEK...ESPECIALLY ON DAYTIME HIGHS. 

THE COLD POOL AND INCREASED RH LINGERING OVER THE GTLKS RGN WILL 
PROVIDE A CHANCE FOR A LATE DAY SHOWER OR TWO...ESPECIALLY WITH SOME 
UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF A S/W OR TWO MOVING THROUGH THE 
AREA. IM SEEING THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS ON BOTH THURS AND FRI...BUT 
WILL LEAVE OUT OF THE FCST ON THURS AS AERIAL COVERAGE WILL BE 
MINIMIAL IF AT ALL. SOME PRECIP IS GETTING SQUEEZED OUT FRIDAY PM ON 
THE SW SIDE OF THE VORT THATS SWINGING IN FROM THE NW AS SHOWN BY 
THE AVN...BUT ETA IS DRY AT THIS POINT AND WILL TREND WITH THE 
CURRENT DRY FORECAST SINCE COVERAGE HERE WILL BE WIDELY SCATTERED AT 
BEST. 

AS FAR AS TEMPS GO...WILL UNDERCUT GUIDANCE BY A DEGREE OR TWO TODAY 
CONSIDERING 6Z READINGS ARE ABOUT 4 DEGREES TOO COLD. REST OF FCST 
IS QUITE CLOSE AND ILL NOT STRAY BY MORE THAN A DEGREE OR TWO FROM 
FWC NUMBERS...BUT THINK THAT TOMORROW IS A LITTLE TOO WARM OVER THE 
SOUTH. 

PRECIP THIS MORNING WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SOUTHEAST GROUP...WITH A 
30 POP. OTHERWISE...AFTERNOON SILENT 20 POPS NOTED IN ZONES.

MOST OF CWA...MID 60S IN THE NORTH UNDER HEAVIEST CLOUD COVER AND 
BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIP. BREEZY AND MILD EVERYWHERE.

MOS TEMPS TONIGHT ARE A BIT TOO WARM...WILL STICK WITH CURRENT FCST 
TEMPS WHICH ARE A CAT LOWER. THIS WOULD ALSO LEAD TO COOLER HIGHS ON 
WEDNESDAY...AND WITH THINKING OF SOME MORNING SUN AND A THICK CU 
DECK IN THE COLD POOL WITH DECENT RH...WILL BE NEAR OR JUST BELOW 
GUIDANCE UNDER CLOUDY SKIES.

MODELS CONTINUE TO TREND SLOWER WITH THIS SYSTEM...WHICH PUTS PRECIP 
TIMING AS A MAINLY OVERNIGHT EVENT BEGINNING LATE AFTERNOON OR 
EVENING. SBCAPES ARENT THAT IMPRESSIVE...BUT SIGNIFICANT WAA AND 
NEG LIS AROUND 0Z WITH APPROACHING FRONT WOULD SUGGEST SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THESE SHOWERS FOR SE 1/2 OF CWA AROUND 0Z. WILL 
MENTION THUNDER IN DAYTON GROUP...BUT ISOLATED. PRECIP SHOULD HOLD 
OFF FOR A GOOD PORTION OF TODAY AND WILL RANGE FROM BECOMING LIKELY

THE WORKS OVERNIGHT...ENDING FROM THE NORTHWEST. 

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN WITH A GRADUAL DAY TO DAY WARMUP...BUT LOW

WEDNESDAY...AND WITH THINKING OF SOME MORNING SUN AND A THICK CU

GUIDANCE UNDER CLOUDY SKIES.

TIMING AS A MAINLY OVERNIGHT EVENT BEGINNING LATE AFTERNOON OR 
EVENING. SBCAPES ARENT THAT IMPRESSIVE...BUT SIGNIFICANT WAA AND 
NEG LIS AROUND 0Z WITH APPROACHING FRONT WOULD SUGGEST SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THESE SHOWERS FOR SE 1/2 OF CWA AROUND 0Z. WILL

OFF FOR A GOOD PORTION OF TODAY AND WILL RANGE FROM BECOMING LIKELY 
IN THE NW TO NO MENTION IN THE SOUTHEAST. CATEGORICAL POPS ARE IN 
THE WORKS OVERNIGHT...ENDING FROM THE NORTHWEST. 

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN WITH A GRADUAL DAY TO DAY WARMUP...BUT LOW

THERE ARE MAJOR CHANGES IN THE MODELS CONCERNING FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
AND NIGHT.

SFC COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM THE UPR MS RIVER VLY SOUTHWARD INTO 
NW MO AND NE KS THIS AFTN.  FRONT...IN CONJUNCTION WITH AN H5 
S/WV... WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SHOWERS AND ELEVATED THUNDERSTORMS ACRS 
IL AND INDIANA.  THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SEEM TO BE LOSING 
SOME OF THERE PUNCH AS THE CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST.  IN FACT...AS ONE 
MOVES AWAY FROM THE SOURCE REGION...MOST STATIONS IN INDIANA ARE 
REPORTING LIGHT RAIN/SPRINKLES OUT OF A SC/AC DECK.  S/WV IS 
FORECAST TO MOVE WELL AWAY FROM SFC FRONTAL BOUNDARY THIS EVENING.  
THUS...EXPECT ONLY SPRINKLES/LIGHT RAIN DURING THE EVENING HOURS AS 
S/WV MOVES OVERHEAD.  AS THE SFC FRONT GETS CLOSER TO THE CWFA 
TONIGHT...SOME WEAK LOW LVL CONV KICKS IN.  THIS MAY BE ENOUGH TO 
WARRANT A 30 TO AS MUCH AS A 40 PERCENT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS.  MOS 
FCST LOWS LOOK REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT...SO WILL STICK CLOSE TO THESE 
VALUES.

THE REAL CONCERN IN THE SHORT TERM IS FOR FRIDAY AFTN AND NIGHT.  
ALL MODELS HAVE TRENDED TOWARD A WET SOLUTION DURING THIS PERIOD.  
THE ETA/AVN ARE IN SIMILAR AGREEMENT IN THE SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES 
WITH THE EXPECTED SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN LOW LVL JET PLACEMENTS.  
WILL FOCUS MORE ON THE ETA MODEL DURING THIS PERIOD AS IT TENDS TO 
DO BETTER WITH LOW LVL JET PLACEMENT AND FRONTAL MOVEMENT.  
AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT WILL SLOW DOWN AS IT MOVES INTO NW OHIO 
AND NRN INDIANA ON FRIDAY.  THE COMBINATION OF A DEVELOPING UPR LVL 
JET IN THE W TO NW FLOW ALOFT AND INCREASING LOW LVL JET (SPEED CONV 
AND DIRECTIONAL CONV) WILL PERTURB A WEAK SFC LOW ALONG THE OHIO 
RIVER VLY.  ALTHOUGH THE SFC LOW MAYBE WEAK...THE DYNAMICS ARE NOT.  
STREAMLINE FCSTS SHOW A GOOD SURGE OF SFC TO 925 MB MOISTURE 
STRAIGHT OUT OF THE GULF OF MEXICO UP INTO THE MIDDLE OHIO VLY.  
THIS MSTR...COMBINED WITH THE CONV/DIV COUPLET OF THE MENTIONED 
PARAMETERS...WILL CAUSE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO 
DEVELOP FRIDAY AFTN IN THE SRN TWO-THIRDS OF THE CWFA...CONTINUING 
INTO THE SE PORTIONS FRIDAY NIGHT.  THE WARM...MOIST AIR WILL YIELD 
SFC BASED CAPES OF AT LEAST 500 J/KG AND POSSIBLY HIGHER DEPENDING 
HOW MUCH SUNSHINE IS RECEIVED BEFORE CLOUDS THICKEN.  BOTTOM LINE:  
PRECIP EFFICIENCIES ARE FCST TO BE AROUND 1.2 INCHES.  SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE HEAVY RAIN PRODUCERS.  TO ADD INSULT TO 
INJURY...THE BEST CHANCE FOR HEAVY RAIN WILL BE ALONG AND SOUTH OF 
THE OHIO RIVER VLY...THE SAME LOCATION THAT HAS BEEN PLAGUE BY HEAVY 
RAIN THIS PAST MONTH.  AS A RESULT...HAVE ALREADY ISSUED A FLOOD 
POTENTIAL OUTLOOK AS NEARLY SATURATED SOILS CAN NOT HANDLE MUCH IN 
THE TERMS OF HEAVY RAINFALL.

THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE RAIN EVENT SHOULD BE OVER A 6 TO 12 HOUR 
PERIOD SO AS TO HOPEFULLY LIMIT THE FLOOD THREAT.  SKIES WILL BECOME 
PARTLY CLOUDY ON SATURDAY AS THE FRONT PUSHES SOUTH AND EAST OF THE 
REGION AND COOLER AND DRIER AIR MOVES IN.

WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP EASTER SUNDAY DRY AS CWFA IS CAUGHT BETWEEN A 
NRN JET STREAM S/WV AND A SRN JET STREAM S/WV ACRS THE SRN UNITED 
STATES.

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO FCST AREA TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
MORNING. NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT REGION WILL COME FROM POSITIVELY 
TILTED H5 TROF DIGGING SE INTO THE GTLKS RGN. AHEAD OF THE NOSE OF 
THE TROF...MODELS ARE SUGGESTING A FAIRLY STRONG VORT AT ITS APEX 
WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE THE LIFT OVER THE INCREASED MOISTURE AND SFC 
TROF. AVN WAS THE FIRST TO LATCH ON TO THIS AND ETA IS CONSISTENTLY 
INCREASING THE DEVELOPMENT BOTH IN SPEED AND AREAL EXTENT. 

PREVIOUS FCST THINKING WAS THAT WEAK H5 RIDGE WOULD SLOW THE 
POSITIVELY TILTED TROF AND WEAKEN IT...BUT THE TROF SEEMS TO BE 
EJECTING THE RIDGE FAIRLY QUICK. AVN BRINGS MORE OF A MEAN H5 LOW N 
OF THE GTLKS WHICH WAS GOOD TO TURN OF THE PRECIP FOR A TIME FRIDAY. 
HOWEVER...SOME OTHER MODELS SUGGESTING THAT POS TILTED TROF 
CONTINUES TO DIG AND SPARKS A BACK DOOR FRONT THAT BRINGS 
APPRECIABLE SNOW IN FOR FRIDAY LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING. AT THIS 
MOMENT, WEVE GOT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR FRIDAY. WILL KEEP 
THIS IN AND INTRO A CHANGE TO SNOW LATER IN THE DAY. I THINK THAT 
THE OTHER MODELS ARE A BIT OVERDONE BUT CANT RULE OUT SNOW SHOWERS. 

AFTER THIS TIME...SFC RIDGE BUILDS OVER OHVLY. THIS SHOULD HOLD SWAY 
OVER THE WX THROUGH SAT. NEXT PROBLEM IS THE CHANCE OF A SRN SFC 
WAVE BRINGING ANOTHER THREAT FOR PRECIP SAT NITE INTO NEXT WEEK. 
SPAGHETTI PLOTS STARTING ON DAY 5 REALLY LIVE UP TO THEIR NAME BY 
DAY 7. UNCERTAINTY IN FCST IS HIGH AFTER THIS TIME...BUT SOLUTIONS 
KEEP HINTING AT THE MEAN H5 LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES MERGING WITH 
THE EJECTING H5 LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST. THIS THINKING WILL BRING ME 
TO AN ABOVE NORMAL CHANCE FOR PRECIP AND NORMAL OR BELOW TEMPS. WILL 
BASICALLY USE THE MRF FOR DAYS 6 AND 7. 

ON TEMPS...HAVE CUT BY A CATEGORY TOMORROW NIGHT WITH DRY AIR IN 
PLACE AND HIGH OVER ERN FCST AREA. EVEN WITH SUN TOMORROW...READINGS 
SHOULD ONLY GET TO THE MID 40S ACROSS FCST AREA WITH SOME MORNING 
CLOUDS.

WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE AVN AND ETA...NOTING THAT THE ETAS 
LATEST RUNS ARE LEANING TOWARDS AVN SOLUTION (WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE 
THE BEST RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY). EXPECT BAND OF HEAVY RAIN ALONG 
APEX OF ETA LOW PRESSURE CENTER...WHICH LINES UP WITH HEAVIEST RAIN 
LINE FROM AVN MODEL. MOISTURE CONVERGENCE FROM ETA AND WEAK SBCAPES 
ALSO AGREE WITH THIS THINKING.

PM TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO BELOW FREEZING BEFORE MIDNIGHT FOR NW 
1/2 OF FCST AREA AND SIGNIFICANT RAIN IS EXPECTED TO FREEZE ON

VALLEY EXPERIENCING A NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.  SFC MAP SHOWS HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER MISSISSIPPI WITH A RATHER TIGHT GRADIENT OVER

WESTERLY AND SFC WINDS SOUTHWESTERLY.  THIS WILL RESULT IN SLIGHTLY 
WARMER TEMPERATURES COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT...BUT STILL CHILLY FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR AT AROUND 20.

THANKS FOR COORDINATION WITH KIWX AND KCLE.

TRICK WITH FCST WILL COME ON SUNDAY AS PRECIP GETS WRUNG OUT N OF 
SFC CDFNT AND MERGING H5 TROF WITH S/W OVER THE GTLKS. PROBLEM HERE 
IS HOW DRY LOW LEVELS WILL BE FOR START OF PRECIP...AND MODELS ARE 
TRENDING TOWARDS A LATER THAN EARLIER SOLUTION. NEXT WILL BE TYPE. 
THICKNESS CURVES RUN RIGHT THROUGH NRN CWA AND ILL CUT THE 
RAIN/SNOW LINE ON SUNDAY FROM JUST N OF I-70 IN IN/OH TO N OF CMH. 
OVERNIGHT...THIS LINE WILL DROP SOUTH SLIGHTLY...BUT WILL KEEP RAIN 
AS PREDOMINANT FEATURE AND RUN A MIX LINE FROM S OF RICHMOND TO DAY 
TO CMH. EXPECT SOUTH OF A CVG-ILN-NEWARK TO STAY ALL RAIN THROUGH 
THIS PERIOD BEFORE ENDING ON MONDAY AFTERNOON.

MODELS SEEM FAIRLY DIVERGENT AFTER DAY 4 AND SPAGHETTI PLOTS ARE ALL 
OVER THE PLACE. I EXPECT A SOLUTION THAT HAS A WEAK PATTERN OVER 
MUCH OF THE U.S. WITH A SLIGHT RIDGE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND 
SOME WEAK TROFFINESS OVER THE GTLKS. THIS SHOULD START AS A ROUND OF 
PRECIP ON WED INTO THURS...AND HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MIDWEST WOULD

07Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED AN ARCTIC COLD FRONT FROM WRN MI...INTO NW 
IL...THEN INTO NRN MO.  THIS FRONT IS POISED TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
REGION TODAY.

ALL MODELS ARE SIMILAR IN THE TRACK OF THE ARCTIC FRONT.  THE BIG 
PROBLEM OF THE DAY WILL BE THE TEMPERATURES.  THERE WILL BE SOME 
MORNING SUNSHINE...ESPECIALLY ACRS THE CMH...DAY AND PMH AREAS.  THE 
COLD FRONT IS FCST TO MOVE THROUGH WAPAKONETA AROUND 10 AM...DAYTON 
AROUND NOON...CMH AND CVG AROUND 1 PM AND PMH AROUND 4 PM.  THE 
SUNSHINE AND WESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO 
RISE BEFORE THEY PLUMMET WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE.  WILL USE A BLEND OF 
FCST TEMP SCHEMES TO COME UP WITH THE FINAL NUMBERS FOR THE CCF 
SITES.

THE BEST DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT WILL BE NORTH AND EAST 
OF THE FCST AREA TODAY.  ENOUGH LOW LVL CONVERGENCE ALONG AND BEHIND 
FRONT SHOULD PRODUCE THE BEST CHC FOR MEASURABLE PCPN IN THE 
WAP...DAY..AND CMH AREAS WITH NO MEASURABLE PCPN EXPECTED FOR CVG 
AND PMH.  WILL INDICATED RAIN SHOWERS/SPRINKLES CHANGING TO SNOW 
SHOWERS/FLURRIES IN ALL AREAS EXCEPT THE PMH GROUP.

FOR TONIGHT...BRIEF FETCH OFF LAKE MICHIGAN COMBINED WITH AN UPR LVL 
VORT MAX WILL KEEP A CHANCE FOR FLURRIES ACRS THE REGION THROUGH 
ABOUT MIDNIGHT...THEN SKIES WILL GRADUALLY CLEAR MOST LOCATIONS AS 
FETCH FROM LAKE MICHIGAN CUTS OFF AND LOW LVL ANTICYCLONIC FLOW 
DEVELOPS.  IT WILL BE A COLD NIGHT WITH TEMPS LOWERING INTO THE 10 
TO 20 DEGREE RANGE.

FOR FRIDAY...ANTICYCLONIC FLOW AND DRYING WILL BRING MOSTLY SUNNY 
CONDITIONS.  THE ONLY EXCEPTION WILL BE THE CMH AREA WHERE ENOUGH 
MSTR MAY PRODUCE CU TO WARRANT PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.  TEMPS WILL 
STRUGGLE TO REACH THE LOWER AND MID 30S...DESPITE THE STRONG MARCH 
SUN.

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...CLEAR SKIES WILL PREVAIL AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES 
SOUTH OF THE REGION.

ON SATURDAY...PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS LOOK REASONABLE.  TEMPS WILL 
REBOUND NICELY INTO THE MID 40S TO AROUND 50 DUE TO A WARMER

LATEST SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS STAGNANT FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACRS THE TN 
VALLEY NOW BEGINNING TO LIFT NORTHWARD.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE 
SRN STREAM S/WV OVER TX AND S/WV NOW MOVING INTO NRN IL.  WEAK SFC 
LOW IS EXPECTED TO MOVE TO ERN KY BY MORNING.  CONCERN IS THAT SFC 
LOW APPEARS A LITTLE FARTHER WEST THAN WHAT THE MODELS ARE SHOWING.  
IN THAT REGARD...EXPECT BAND OF MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY TO 
CONTINUE ACRS THE FLOOD WATCH AREA THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS.  WITH 
S/WV MOVING ACRS THE SRN GREAT LAKES...WILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME 
MENTION OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE MORNING.  THINGS SHOULD START TO WIND 
DOWN DURING THE AFTN HOURS.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO VLY.  
BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH SUBSIDENCE ASSOCD WITH THE HIGH TO 
ALLOW SKIES TO BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR WEST AND PARTLY CLOUDY EAST.  
WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG IN THE SRN CWFA WHERE WINDS WILL BE LIGHT 
FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE NIGHT.

THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER WILL BE AN ARCTIC FRONT POISED TO MOVE SE 
THROUGH THE CWFA ON THURSDAY.  THIS WILL CAUSE TEMPERATURES TO 
TUMBLE OVER MOST OF THE CWFA DURING THE DAY.  WILL INTRODUCE A CHC 
OF SNOW ACRS THE NW CWFA BY AFTN...AND ACRS THE REMAINING CWFA BY 
LATE AFTN OR EVENING.  

FRIDAY SHOULD BE A COLD DAY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE EXTREMELY TRICKY OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  WILL 
SIDE WITH THE COOLER MAV NUMBERS FOR TODAY AS IT SHOULD STAY CLOUDY 
AND RAINY FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY...NOT ALLOWING TEMPS TO RISE 
MUCH FROM THEIR CURRENT READINGS.  ALSO...SOME CAA IN THE NW BY AFTN 
WILL HELP TO KEEPS TEMPS NEAR CURRENT READINGS.

FOR THURSDAY...WILL USE A BLEND OF THE AVN MAV AND FWC MOS AS THIS 
SEEMS TO WORK WELL WITH AN ARCTIC FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE REGION.

LATEST SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS STAGNANT FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACRS THE TN 
VALLEY NOW BEGINNING TO LIFT NORTHWARD.  THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO THE 
SRN STREAM S/WV OVER TX AND S/WV NOW MOVING INTO NRN IL.  WEAK SFC 
LOW IS EXPECTED TO MOVE TO ERN KY BY MORNING.  CONCERN IS THAT SFC 
LOW APPEARS A LITTLE FARTHER WEST THAN WHAT THE MODELS ARE SHOWING.  
IN THAT REGARD...EXPECT BAND OF MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY TO 
CONTINUE ACRS THE FLOOD WATCH AREA THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS.  WITH 
S/WV MOVING ACRS THE SRN GREAT LAKES...WILL HAVE TO HAVE SOME 
MENTION OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE MORNING.  THINGS SHOULD START TO WIND 
DOWN DURING THE AFTN HOURS.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO VLY.  
BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH SUBSIDENCE ASSOCD WITH THE HIGH TO 
ALLOW SKIES TO BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR WEST AND PARTLY CLOUDY EAST.  
WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG IN THE SRN CWFA WHERE WINDS WILL BE LIGHT 
FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE NIGHT.

THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER WILL BE AN ARCTIC FRONT POISED TO MOVE SE 
THROUGH THE CWFA ON THURSDAY.  THIS WILL CAUSE TEMPERATURES TO 
TUMBLE OVER MOST OF THE CWFA DURING THE DAY.  WILL INTRODUCE A CHC 
OF SNOW ACRS THE NW CWFA BY AFTN...AND ACRS THE REMAINING CWFA BY 
LATE AFTN OR EVENING.  

FRIDAY SHOULD BE A COLD DAY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE EXTREMELY TRICKY OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS.  WILL 
SIDE WITH THE COOLER MAV NUMBERS FOR TODAY AS IT SHOULD STAY CLOUDY 
AND RAINY FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY...NOT ALLOWING TEMPS TO RISE 
MUCH FROM THEIR CURRENT READINGS.  ALSO...SOME CAA IN THE NW BY AFTN 
WILL HELP TO KEEPS TEMPS NEAR CURRENT READINGS.

FOR THURSDAY...WILL USE A BLEND OF THE AVN MAV AND FWC MOS AS THIS 
SEEMS TO WORK WELL WITH AN ARCTIC FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE REGION.




.ILN...FLOOD WATCH UNTIL NOON TODAY FOR KYZ094>100-OHZ079-081-088.

SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACRS THE SERN U.S. 
INTO TEXAS.  THIS WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL LIFT NORTH TODAY TOWARD 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY.

ETA/AVN ARE IN SIMILAR AGREEMENT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING...THEN 
THEY DIVERGE SOMEWHAT THEREAFTER.  A WARM...MOIST SURGE FROM THE 
GULF OF MEXICO COMBINED WITH A SUBTROPICAL FETCH WILL BRING 
WIDESPREAD RAIN TO THE SRN CWFA TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING.  
MOSAIC RADAR THIS AM ALREADY SHOWING WIDESPREAD LIGHT RAIN GENERALLY 
ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER.  THIS AREA OF RAIN WILL BE SLOW 
TO MOVE NORTH (AS DEPICTED BY THE ETA MODEL) AS A DRIER EASTERLY LOW 
LEVEL FLOW WILL INHIBIT ITS NORTHWARD PROGRESSION.  THUS...POPS WILL 
BE STRATIFIED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THE NORTHERN MIAMI VLY SOUTH INTO 
THE FAR SRN KENTUCKY COUNTIES.  LOOKING AT SFC AND ELEVATED BASED 
LIS...I AM NOT ANTICIPATING ANY THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...RAIN SHIELD SHOULD PROGRESS A LITTLE FARTHER 
NORTH...INCREASING THE CHANCES FOR RAIN ACRS THE REST OF THE CWFA.  
ELEVATED BASED LIS INDICATED A CHC FOR THUNDERSTORMS ACRS THE FAR 
SRN CWFA.  WITH SATURATED SOILS FROM RECENT HEAVY RAINS OVER THE 
SERN CWFA...WILL CONTINUE WITH FLOOD WATCH AS ESTIMATED QPF AMOUNTS 
OF 1.00 TO 1.50 IN A 24 HR PERIOD WILL CAUSE CREEKS/STREAMS AND 
RIVERS TO RISE...POSSIBLY SENDING SOME OUT OF THEIR BANKS.

FOR WEDNESDAY...WILL BELIEVE THE AVN SOLUTION WHICH PROGRESSES SFC 
LOW ALONG THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY INTO THE MID ATLANTIC REGION.  THIS 
MAKES SENSE GIVEN THE APCH OF AN ARCTIC COLD FRONT FROM THE NW AND A 
SRN STREAM S/WV WHICH BOTH SHOULD GIVE THE PCPN A PUSH TO THE EAST.  
THUS...WILL LINGER PCPN IN THE REGION ONLY DURING THE MORNING HOURS.

SKIES WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY WEDNESDAY NIGHT BEFORE GIVING AWAY 
TO MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR THURSDAY AS AN ARCTIC BLAST CAUSES 
TEMPERATURES TO TUMBLE.  A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE MENTION 
FOR THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT.

WILL GO WITH MOS VALUES TODAY FOR TEMPS (SEE LITTLE RECOVERY WITH 
CLOUDS AND ONSET OF PCPN) AND TONIGHT.  MOS SEEMS A BIT WARM 
TOMORROW...GIVEN MORNING PCPN AND LINGERING CLOUDS...SO WILL SIDE 
MORE TO THE AVN MOS.  FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT...TEMPS SHOULD DROP INTO 
THE LOWER TO UPPER 30S WITH PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS AND DRIER 
AIR...SO WILL SIDE WITH AVN MOS.

DRIZZLE...LIGHT RAIN AND SHOWERS OVER THE SOUTH HAVE INCREASED 
VISIBILITIES ACROSS MUCH OF THE FCST AREA AS AIR IS FINALLY MIXING 
IN AND NEAR THE PRECIPITATION.

WILL HAVE TO UPDATE SERN FCST AREA TO BUMP SHOWERS FROM CHANCE TO 
LIKELY. WILL BREAK OUT ANOTHER TIER OF COUNTIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 
DIFFERNENCE IN POPS. CVG AND CMH METRO FORECASTS LOOK FINE. WILL 
HAVE TO ADJUST FROM THE 30 POPS THERE TO LIKELY TOWARDS PORTSMOUTH. 
EXPECT TO REMOVE THE PATCHY DENSE FOG WORDING WHERE PRECIP WILL 
OCCUR AS WELL. TEMPS SHOULD STILL MAKE A SLOW RISE THROUGH THE 
NIGHT...OR AT LEAST STAY NEARLY STEADY.

LEAST GETTING 2-3 MILES OF VSBY UNDER CLOUD DECK. 

DRY AIR STILL BEING FORECAST BY MODELS IN THE LOWEST LEVELS...BUT 
ITS GOING TO TAKE SOME TIME TO WORK DOWN TO THE SURFACE...IF IT 
EVER REALLY GETS THERE. ILN SOUNDING SHOWS A NICE DRY LAYER WHERE 
WESTERLY WINDS AT 40 KT KICK IN JUST UNDER 850 MB.

MODEL GUIDANCE ON TEMPERATURES IS NOT WORTH MUCH TONIGHT. INITIALLY 
THOUGHT TO CONTINUE STEADY TEMPS IN THE SOUTH AND STILL HAVE LOWS IN 
THE NORTHWEST...BUT WILL NOW MENTION STEADY IN THE NORTHWEST...AND 
SLOWLY RISING FOR REMAINDER OF FCST AREA AS A GRADUAL RISE IN TEMPS 
SEEMS TO BE THE RULE...EVEN WITH WEAK SFC WINDS. HAVE ADJUSTED SKY 
COVER FOR TOMORROW TO BE MOSTLY CLOUDY...BUT WILL KEEP TEMPS THE

MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS CYCLE.  WARM FRONT ACROSS 
NORTHERN OHIO WILL CONTINUE TO PULL NORTH OVERNIGHT.  SOME MID TO 
HIGH CLOUDS WILL WORK INTO THE FA...SO A MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY 
CLOUDY LOOKS GOOD FOR TONIGHT.

FA REMAINS IN THE WARM SECTOR TOMORROW. STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW WITH 
925 WINDS 30 TO 40 KTS AND 850 WINDS TO 45 KTS ARE PROGGED ON THE 
MODELS.  ATMOSPHERE SHOULD BE WELL MIXED WITH ONLY SOME CIRRUS OVER 
TOP...SO EXPECT GUSTS TO REACH THE 925 WINDS.  WILL GO WITH WINDY 
WORDING.

LITTLE LIFT UNTIL THE FRONT APPROACHES LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...SO 
WILL MAKE THE EAST DRY...BUT WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN THE WEST.  
GOOD LIFT WITH THE FRONT ON SATURDAY.  850 WINDS 50 TO 60 KNOTS ARE 
JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT...BUT TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE BEFORE 
18Z...SHOULD RULE OUT A LOT OVER SEVERE TRW.  STILL SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY FOR GOOD COVERAGE OF THUNDER.  1000-850 THICKNESS LATE 
SATURDAY ARE SHOWING THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SNOW SHOWERS MIXING IN 
LATE.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES....WITH LESS CLOUD COVER TONIGHT...TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW THIS MORNINGS NUMBERS...SO WONT STRAY 
TOO FAR FROM MOS.  TOMORROW LOOKS WARM...MOS AS WARMED 
SIGNIFICANTLY...SO WILL ONLY TWEAK A DEGREE OR TWO AT THE CCF SITES.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES COLD FRONT THROUGH KCMH AND KHTS.  COLDER 
AIR IS RAPIDLY MOVING INTO FA.  REGIONAL RADARS INDICATE SOME LIGHT 
RAIN IN ERN FA ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT AND DEFORMATION SNOW OVER 
NRN IN/IL.

MODELS ARE ALL IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE TO 
MENTION IS TIMING OF CLIPPER MOVING THROUGH GREAT LAKES MONDAY 
NIGHT.  THE ETA/UKMET ARE THE FASTEST WITH AVN A BIT SLOWER.  
SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS CAN BE EXPECTED TODAY AS COLD POOL ALOFT 
ALLOWS FOR LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY SNOW SHOWERS TO DEVELOP.  LAKE MI 
WILL PROVIDE SOME OF THE MOISTURE AND A DEEPENING WAVE MOVING ACROSS 
FA WILL PROVIDE THE LIFT.  COLD POOL CENTERS OVER FA MONDAY 
MORNING.  KEEPING CLOUDS AROUND AND THE THREAT OF SNOW SHOWERS OR 
FLURRIES.  SKIES WILL CLEAR TO SOME DEGREE FOR MONDAY AS SURFACE 
RIDGE BUILDS INTO FA.

TEMPERATURE FORECAST IS A TRICKY ONE.  HIGHS TODAY WILL LIKELY OCCUR 
AT 12Z.  WILL GO WITH STEADY TEMPERATURES IN THE WEST AND SLOWLY 
FALLING IN THE EAST.  TONIGHT WILL BE ONE OF THE COLDEST NIGHTS OF

LOOK GOOD.  WITH HIGH LINGERING OF THE APPALACHIANS TONIGHT WILL 
LOWER TEMPERATURES A DEGREE TO SO.  REST OF FORECAST LOOKS GOOD.

PESKY LOW CLOUD DECK REMAINS OVER THE FCST AREA THIS AFTN.  THIS IS 
ASSOCD WITH 850 MB COLD POOL ALOFT.  THIS COLD POOL WILL GRADUALLY 
MOVE SOUTH AND EAST THIS EVENING...ALLOWING FOR DRIER AIR FROM THE 
WEST TO MOVE INTO THE REGION.  WILL GO BECOMING MOSTLY CLEAR WEST 
FOR THIS EVENING.  FOR THE EASTERN AREAS...WILL HAVE MOSTLY CLOUDY 
DURING THE EVENING WITH CLEARING EXPECTED BY LATE EVENING OR SHORTLY 
AFTER MIDNIGHT.  ONCE CLEARING TAKES PLACE...A SFC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL SETTLE ACRS THE CWFA...BRINGING LIGHT WINDS.  
THUS...TEMPS SHOULD RADIATIONAL COOL TO LOWS IN THE UPPER TEENS TO 
AROUND 20 DEGREES.  WILL GOOD A LITTLE COOLER THAN MOS GUIDANCE DUE 
TO THE EXPECTED RADIATIONAL COOLING...PARTICULARLY IN THE WRN

ON SATURDAY...SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST.  MODELS AGREE 
THAT MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS (DUE TO WAA ALOFT MOVING ACRS THE 
GREAT LAKES) WILL SPILL INTO THE OHIO VALLEY DURING THE DAY.

BY AFTERNOON.  ELSEWHERE...SKIES SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY SUNNY FOR THE 
GOOD PORTION OF THE DAYLIGHT HOURS.  THICKNESS SCHEMES...SOUNDING 
FCSTS AND ETA SFC TEMPS POINT TO HIGHS CLOSER TO THE WARMER MAV 
VALUES...AND WILL USE THIS.

FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...A MIX OF MID AND HIGH CLOUDS WILL YIELD PARTLY 
CLOUDY CONDITIONS.

ALL MODELS ARE STILL FORECASTING AN ARCTIC FRONT TO MOVE SOUTHEAST 
FROM THE WESTERN PROVINCES OF CANADA SOUTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY 
BY MONDAY.  A NICE S TO SW FLOW AHEAD OF THIS FRONT WILL BOOST TEMPS 
INTO THE 50S ON SUNDAY.  RH FIELDS SHOW MAINLY 500 MB TO 300 MB 
MSTR...AND ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS AT THESE LVLS PORTEND THAT SKIES 
SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLOUDY ON SUNDAY.  WILL CUT SLIGHTLY ON MOS TEMPS 
WITH EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

MODEL TRENDS HAVE SLOWED DOWN THE PROGRESSION OF THE ARCTIC FRONT ON 
MONDAY.  THE FRONT MOVES INTO THE WRN CWFA DURING THE AFTN AND INTO 
THE ERN CWFA BY LATE AFTN.  WILL GO WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 40S WEST 
EARLY WITH TEMPS FALLING INTO THE MID 30S BY EVENING.  FOR THE 
EAST...WILL GO WITH HIGHS IN THE 45 TO 50 DEGREE RANGE WITH TEMPS 
FALLING INTO THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S BY EVENING.  THERE IS NOT A 
GREAT DEAL OF PCPN ALONG AND BEHIND THE FRONT INITIALLY.  A CHC OF 
RAIN SHOWERS CHANGING TO SNOW SHOWERS (DEPENDING ON WHERE YOU ARE 
AT) WILL BE EMPLOYED FOR THE DAYLIGHT HOURS ON MONDAY.

AVN BRINGS A STRONG S/WV BEHIND THE ARCTIC FRONT FOR MONDAY NIGHT 
WHICH MAY DEVELOP AN AREA OF SNOW.

MUCH COLDER TEMPS WILL CONTINUE FOR MUCH OF NEXT WEEK.  A SOUTHERN

CURRENT CHALLENGES TODAY ARE THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING WINDS 
TOWARDS DAYBREAK WITH LLVL 50-60KT WINDS NOTED WITH THE NOCTURNAL 
JET. SHOWERS SHOULD BE NUMEROUS TO WIDESPREAD AT THIS TIME...AND 
SOME OF THESE WINDS COULD GET DOWN TO THE SFC WITH A LITTLE 
LUCK...EVEN IN WAA. ATTM...WILL WORD AS BECOMING WINDY TONIGHT AND 
STAYING THAT WAY THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY. 

NEXT SHOT OF BAD WX WOULD BE IN THE DRY SLOT BEHIND INITIAL SHOT OF 
PRECIP WED MORNING. THIS WOULD OCCUR AT A TIME WHERE SUNSHINE COULD 
WARM TEMPS TO GIVE SOME GOOD DIFFERENTIAL HEATING. CAPES ONLY GET TO 
ABOUT 500 J/KG, BUT LIS GO NEGATIVE BRIEFLY AND HELICITY IS A 
PLAYER THROUGH THE DAY...ESPECIALLY EARLY. IF CONVECTION IS STRONG 
ENOUGH, ID EXPECT SOME SVR BUT AM NOT TOO POSITIVE ON AMOUNT OF 
SUNSHINE IN DRY SLOT TO PROVIDE THIS. 

TEMPS ARE TRICKY. ETA BRINGS 60 DEGREE ISOTHERM ALL THE WAY UP TO 
TOLEDO IN THE DRY SLOT TOMORROW. FOR TONIGHT...TEMPS IN THE RAIN 
COOLED AIR ARE DROPPING TO THE LOW AND MID 40S...BUT THEN REBOUND AS 
HIGHER DEWPOINT AIR GETS ADVECTED IN ON GOOD WINDS. WILL LIKELY MOS 
OUT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS TOO MUCH VARIABILITY MAKES IT NEAR 
IMPOSSIBLE TO ADD OR SUBTRACT FROM CURRENT TEMP GUIDANCE.

CHANGEOVER TO A MIX AND THEN SNOW EXPECTED STARTING OVERNIGHT WED 
INTO THURS AS CAA KICKS IN ON BACK SIDE OF THE LOW. AM NOT THINKING 
OF ANY ACCUMULATION AS SHOWERS SHOULD BE SCATTERED.

FOR THE EXTENDED...AM CONCERNED ABOUT H5 PATTERN STRETCHING E-W JUST 
N OF THE U.S. IF THIS IS CLOSE TO BEING RIGHT...I WOULD EXPECT THE 
SURFACE LOW NOTED OVER THE GREAT LAKES ON SAT PM TO BRING A WAA 
PATTERN TO THE OHVLY AS OPPOSED TO THE MRF AND CANADIAN MODELS 
DROPPING A SFC FRONT THROUGH THE GULF STATES STARTING SUN PM AND 
MONDAY. THOUGH THE MAJORITY OF MODELS ARE SHOWING SOME REMNANT OF 
THIS FEATURE...I LIKE THE COMPROMISE BETWEEN TH EECMWF AND THE 
CANADIAN MODEL TO STICK WITH THE WARMER AND DRIER SOLUTION. WILL 
KEEP ANY PRECIP NOTED IN EXTENDED AS RAIN AND EXPECT HIGHS TO BE IN 
THE MID 40S VS MID AND UPPER 30S. PM LOWS WILL BE HARD TO GET TO THE

MAIN CONCERN WITH FCST IS GOING TO BE THREAT OF SVR TUES NIGHT AND 
WED. SINCE ITS SO FAR OUT...WILL ONLY WORD SW 2/3 OF FCST AREA AS 
WINDY OVERNIGHT WITH CATEGORICAL SHOWERS. IF ETAS SOLUTION OF A 
50KT 925 JET COMES TO PASS...IT LOOKS LIKE SYNOPTIC HIGH WINDS 
ACROSS SRN 2/3 OF FCST AREA POSSIBLE IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ON 
WEDNESDAY. LATER IN THE DAY...THE DRY SLOT COMES INTO PLAY AND WILL 
BE WORRIED ABOUT POSBL SVR WITH GOOD DIFFERENTIAL HEATING. LLJET 
SHOULD BE THROUGH FCST AREA BY THE TIME DRY SLOT COMES IN AND 
SHOULDNT BE A FACTOR TO ADD TO THE THREAT. 

DOWNSLOPING SOUTHEAST WIND OVER FCST AREA AND SLOWING TRENDS OF 
MODELS WILL ALSO POSE A CHALLENGE ON WHEN PRECIP ENTERS ON WED PM 
AND WHAT PARTS OF CWA ARE AFFECTED. EXPECT TO FOLLOW ETAS CUE HERE 
AS AVN SOLUTION IS A LITTLE TOO QUICK AND IT ALWAYS OVERDOES BROAD 
AREA OF PRECIPITATION.

MAIN TEMPERATURE CHALLENGE WILL BE LOW TEMPS ON TUES PM AND HIGHS ON 
WEDNESDAY. EXPECT TO STAY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON THESE DAYS SINCE 
THERES TOO MUCH THAT COULD GO WRONG. CURRENT WORDING HAS EARLY LOWS 
WITH RISING TEMPS OVERNIGHT...AND WILL STICK WITH THAT THINKING. ON 
WEDNESDAY...MODELS HOLD OFF ON THE COLD FRONT UNTIL LATE IN THE 
DAY...HOWEVER PRECIP AND CLOUDS SHOULD KEEP TEMPS COOL. AM NOT SO 
CERTAIN THAT THE DRY SLOT WONT ALLOW TEMPS TO REACH MID AND UPPER 
50S AS GUIDANCE IS SHOWING...AND THE LAST TIME WE HAD A DRY SLOT 
LIKE THIS WE GOT EVEN WARMER. WITH SO MUCH VARIABILITY, WILL STAY 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE, BUT BUMP POPS DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY FROM 
CHANCE TO LIKELY SINCE THERES A 2 SHOT CHANCE  - ONE EARLY... 
ESPECIALLY EAST AND ONE LATE...ESPECIALLY WEST. 

REMAINDER OF FCST IS FAIRLY STRAIGHTFORWARD. A DROP IN TEMPERATURES 
EXPECTED AS NW FLOW SETS UP WITH H5 LOW MEANDERING JUST N OF GTLKS. 
A VORT KICKS SOME ENERGY OUT OF THIS LOW TOWARDS THE GULF ON FRIDAY 
AND IS EXPECTED TO HELP SPIN UP A GOOD EAST COAST SYSTEM FOR THE 
WEEKEND. AS THIS IS HAPPENING...SFC RIDGING SETS UP OVER OHVLY... 
THOUGH CLOUD COVER SHOULD KEEP HIGH TEMPS FROM RISING TOO MUCH. 
CANADIAN MODEL IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN MRF...BUT BROAD PATTERNS ARE 
QUITE CLOSE. EXPECT TEMPS ON SUNDAY MORNING TO BE THE COOLEST WITH A 
RETURN TO SOUTHWEST FLOW DURING THE DAY AND A BIT OF A WARMUP FOR

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR WEST WITH 
NORTHERLY FLOW OFF THE GREAT LAKE OVER FA.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH 48 HOURS.  AFTER 48 
HOURS THE AVN IS A BIT FASTER THAN THE ETA.  DPROG/DT AT 60HR OFF 
THE AVN INDICATES RUN TO RUN CONTINUITY.  IT SEEMS LIKE THE SLOWER 
SOLUTION WOULD BE BETTER WITH THIS AMPLIFIED FLOW BUT THE AVN HAS 
BEEN HANDLING THE AMPLIFIED FLOW SYSTEMS BETTER THIS WINTER AND WE 
ALREADY HAD THE MENTION OF PRECIP IN FORECAST.  SO WILL GO WITH A 
COMPROMISE AND PUT 30 POPS LATE IN THE WEST FOR TUESDAY.

BETWEEN NOW AND TUESDAY MORNING...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING CLEAR 
SKIES AND DESCENT DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGES.  OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL 
GET DOWN TO AROUND 20 ACROSS FA AND RISE TO THE MID TO UPPER 40S FOR 
HIGHS ON MONDAY.  MONDAY HIGHS WILL BE A BIT WARMER THAN FWC.  
RETURN FLOW WILL KEEP LOWS MILDER FOR TUESDAY MORNING.  TUESDAY HIGH

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER REGION AS SURFACE 
COLD FRONT ADVANCES ON OHIO VALLEY.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES 
ONLY A FEW CIRRUS OVER FA.

MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING COLD FRONT THROUGH 
OHIO VALLEY ON FRIDAY.  AS EXPECTED THE AVN IS MORE GENEROUS WITH 
QPF AND RH WITH THE COLD FRONT.  THE ETA IS DRIER WHICH SEEMS MORE 
REASONABLE AS THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH IT IS 
LACKING.  AS A RESULT WILL KEEP THE SMALL POPS IN THE AFTERNOON AND 
LINGER INTO THE EVENING AROUND PORTSMOUTH.  FORECAST FOR SATURDAY IS 
A BIT MORE CHALLENGING.  FWC AND MAV ALL INDICATE STRATA CU WITH 
FLOW OFF THE GREAT LAKES.  ETA LOW LEVELS SO SOME RIDGING AND DRIER 
LOW LEVELS FOR A PORTION OF THE DAY BEFORE NORTHERLY FLOW OFF THE 
LAKES KICKS IN.  WILL GO WITH MO CLOUDY IN THE NORTH AND PARTLY 
CLOUDY ACROSS THE NORTH.  THINK FWC/MAV TEMPS ARE A CATEGORY TOO 
COOL WHEN COMPARED TO UPSTREAM TEMPS AND SURFACE TEMPS OFF MESOETA.  
FWC TEMPS LOOK PRETTY GOOD FOR THE FIRST 3 PERIODS.

EXTENDED...MRF...UKMET...ECMWF AND 12Z AVN ALL SIMILAR WITH MAJOR

07Z SFC ANALYSIS INDICATED A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING FROM 
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY NORTHEAST INTO NEW ENGLAND.  SATELLITE SHOWED 
CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE REGION.

SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO MOVE OFF TO THE SE TODAY AS A 
WEATHER SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE NRN PLAIN STATES.  SKIES WILL BE SUNNY 
THIS MORNING...THEN SOME CIRRUS WILL BEGIN TO SPILL INTO THE REGION 
FROM THE NW AHEAD OF THE AFOREMENTIONED WEATHER SYSTEM.  USING ALL 
AVAILABLE TEMPERATURE TECHNIQUES (SOUNDINGS/THICKNESS/PARCEL 
TRAJECTORIES)...IT APPEARS TEMPS WILL BE NEAR THE SLIGHTLY COOLER 
MAV VALUES.

AVN/ETA MODELS ARE NOW MORE IN LINE WITH THE H5 S/WV AND ASSOCD COLD 
FRONT POISED TO MOVE INTO THE REGION LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING.  HIGH CLOUDS WILL THICKEN OVERNIGHT...BUT SHOULD STILL BE 
PARTLY CLOUDY FOR THE MOST PART.  ON FRIDAY...LOW AND MID LVL MSTR 
WILL BE ON THE INCREASE...BRINING MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS.  THE 
COLD FRONT WILL BE STARVED FOR MSTR AS THE GULF OF MEXICO IS NEARLY 
SHUT OFF.  THE ETA GENERATES NO QPF OVER THE REGION AHEAD AND ALONG 
THE COLD FRONT WHILE THE AVN GENERATES A SMALL AMOUNT.  GIVEN THAT 
THERE IS A COLD FRONT...THERE WILL LIKELY BE A SMALL CHANCE FOR 
PCPN.  WILL CONTINUE THE 30 POP VALUES FROM THE PREVIOUS FCST.  
MODELS HAVE TRENDED MUCH WARMER AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM.  THUS... 
ANYTHING THAT FALLS WILL BE OF THE LIQUID VARIETY.  THE AVN BRINGS 
THE COLD FRONT TO THE OHIO/INDIANA BORDER BY 00Z SATURDAY WHILE THE 
ETA HAS THE FRONT INTO WRN OHIO AT THE SAME TIME.  CONSEQUENTLY 
...THERE IS ABOUT A 3 HR DIFFERENCE IN FRONTAL POSITION SOLUTION.  
WILL HANG ON TO A SMALL 30 POP EARLY IN THE WEST AND UNTIL MIDNIGHT 
IN THE EAST FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

COOLER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION ON SATURDAY.  UPR LVL SHEAR 
VORTICITY IN A NW FLOW ALOFT MAY PRODUCE A FEW FLURRIES.  WILL 
INTRODUCE A CHANCE FOR FLURRIES IN THE FCST FOR SATURDAY.

07Z SFC ANALYSIS SHOWED A COLD FRONT FROM NRN NEW ENGLAND SOUTHWEST

ACCOMPANY ITS PASSAGE.  THUS...FOR THIS MORNING...SOME CLOUDINESS

SFC ANALYSIS THIS MORNING DEPICTED A VIGOROUS LOW PRESSURE AREA 
LOCATED NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR.  A COLD FRONT TRAILED FROM THIS LOW 
FROM LAKE SUPERIOR...THEN NW INTO NE MN.  THIS FRONT WILL BE THE 
NEXT WEATHER MAKER TO AFFECT OUR REGION OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

AVN/ETA ARE SIMILAR WITH THE SYNOPTIC FEATURES ASSOCD WITH THE 
AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT.  A TREND ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM 
IS PERHAPS JUST A TAD SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS.  THE COLD FRONT AND 
ITS UPR LVL SHEARED OUT S/WV WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE SRN GREAT 
LAKES BY LATE AFTERNOON.  ALTHOUGH SOME COLD AIR ADVECTION BEGINS 
(850 MB LVL) WELL AHEAD OF THE SFC FRONT...LOW LVL WAA SHOULD BOOST 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE 40S ALL LOCATIONS TODAY.  SKIES WILL BE PARTLY 
SUNNY FOR THE MOST PART AS MID AND HIGH LVL CLOUDINESS SKIRT ACRS 
THE REGION.  SOME CU/STRATOCU SHOULD MAKE IT INTO THE FAR NRN CWFA 
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS.  WILL GO PARTLY SUNNY THIS AM...THEN 
BECOMING MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR THE AFTN HOURS THERE.  BRISK CONDITIONS 
CAN BE EXPECTED AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT REMAINS MODEST FROM LOW 
PRESSURE IN CANADA.

FOR TONIGHT...THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE NRN CWFA THIS 
EVENING (AROUND 00Z) AND THEN THROUGH THE SRN CWFA AFT 06Z.  THE UPR 
LVL DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM ARE WEAK GIVEN THE SHEAR OUT 
CONFIGURATION OF THE VORTICITY AT THE H5 LVL.   THE LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE IS WEAK AS WELL.  TO TOP IT OFF...THE GULF OF MEXICO IS 
COMPLETELY CLOSED FOR BUSINESS AS THE LOW LEVEL FLOW IS FROM A WEST

SFC ANALYSIS THIS MORNING DEPICTED A VIGOROUS LOW PRESSURE AREA 
LOCATED NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR.  A COLD FRONT TRAILED FROM THIS LOW 
FROM LAKE SUPERIOR...THEN NW INTO NE MN.  THIS FRONT WILL BE THE 
NEXT WEATHER MAKER TO AFFECT OUR REGION OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

AVN/ETA ARE SIMILAR WITH THE SYNOPTIC FEATURES ASSOCD WITH THE 
AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT.  A TREND ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE SYSTEM 
IS PERHAPS JUST A TAD SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS.  THE COLD FRONT AND 
ITS UPR LVL SHEARED OUT S/WV WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE SRN GREAT 
LAKES BY LATE AFTERNOON.  ALTHOUGH SOME COLD AIR ADVECTION BEGINS 
(850 MB LVL) WELL AHEAD OF THE SFC FRONT...LOW LVL WAA SHOULD BOOST 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE 40S ALL LOCATIONS TODAY.  SKIES WILL BE PARTLY 
SUNNY FOR THE MOST PART AS MID AND HIGH LVL CLOUDINESS SKIRT ACRS 
THE REGION.  SOME CU/STRATOCU SHOULD MAKE IT INTO THE FAR NRN CWFA 
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS.  WILL GO PARTLY SUNNY THIS AM...THEN 
BECOMING MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR THE AFTN HOURS THERE.  BRISK CONDITIONS 
CAN BE EXPECTED AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT REMAINS MODEST FROM LOW 
PRESSURE IN CANADA.

FOR TONIGHT...THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE NRN CWFA THIS 
EVENING (AROUND 00Z) AND THEN THROUGH THE SRN CWFA AFT 06Z.  THE UPR 
LVL DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM ARE WEAK GIVEN THE SHEAR OUT 
CONFIGURATION OF THE VORTICITY AT THE H5 LVL.   THE LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE IS WEAK AS WELL.  TO TOP IT OFF...THE GULF OF MEXICO IS 
COMPLETELY CLOSED FOR BUSINESS AS THE LOW LEVEL FLOW IS FROM A WEST 
TO NW DIRECTION.  THUS...AM EXPECTING AT BEST A CHC OF FLURRIES MOST 
LOCATIONS.  WILL CARRY A 30 POP OF SNOW SHOWERS FAR NORTH AS SOME 
MSTR FROM LAKE MICHIGAN MAY ENHANCE THE CHC/S OF MEASURABLE PCPN

IT APPEARS THAT THE COLD FRONT IS IN EASTERN INDIANA...JUST WEST OF MY 
FA.  SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED JUST AHEAD OF COLD FRONT.  THE 
FRONT WILL PUSH ACROSS THE WESTERN COUNTIES LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO 
THE EVENING...THEN ACROSS THE EAST.  RAIN/SNOW LINE IS STILL WELL TO 
THE WEST AND NORTH.  MODELS REMAIN CONSISTENT IN PUSHING THE 1300M 
1000-850MB THICKNESS LINE ACROSS THE FA BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z.  THIS 
SEEMS REASONABLE AND WONT CHANGE THAT PART OF THE FORECAST.  BIGGEST 
QUESTION IS WHAT POPS TO CARRY.  LOOKING AT RADARS BACK OUT TO THE 
WEST...AN AREA OF STRATIFORM PRECIPITATION IS GROWING.  WILL GO WITH 
LIKELY POPS DUE TO THIS COVERAGE...BUT THINK THAT AS COLDER AIR WORKS 
IN...THAT THE THE SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE OF A MORE SCATTERED NATURE.

850 MB AND ABOVE DRY OUT RAPIDLY AFTER 06Z TONIGHT.  THE 925 MB 
MOISTURE LINGERS A LITTLE LONGER.  WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CLEARING OUT 
OF THE NORTHWEST LATE TONIGHT.  MOS CONTINUE TO WARM WITH THE LOWS 
TONIGHT.  WONT STRAY TOO FAR.

EXPECT SUNNY SKIES TOMORROW AS SYSTEM PULLS EAST.   CURU IS SHOWING NO 
CU.  ONCE AGAIN NGM MOS TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED AND SEE NO NEED TO 
CHANGE.

SYSTEM FOR TUESDAY IS A LITTLE SLOWER.  WILL LIMIT THE PRECIPITATION TO

UPPER AIR PATTERN HAS WEAK H5 RIDGE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AHEAD OF 
CUTOFF LOW ENTERING SOUTHERN PLAINS.  AXIS OF TROF IS PROGGED TO 
CROSS OUR AREA ON THURSDAY...WITH THE AVN SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE 
ETA.  

SFC MAP SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE SPRAWLED ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE 
CONUS...WITH A DEVELOPING INVERTED TROF ALONG THE GULF COAST.  TROF 
WILL LIFT NORTHEAST TO THE CAROLINAS AHEAD OF UPPER LOW.  PRECIP 
SHIELD NORTH OF TROF IS FCST TO BRUSH OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES...WITH 
ETA AND AVN QPF REACHING OUR CWA LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY.  
ETA HAS SOMEWHAT HIGHER QPF WITH A BAND OF AROUND .10 NEAR THE OHIO 
RIVER AT 12Z THURSDAY.

SATELLITE SHOWS MID AND HIGH CLOUDS STREAMING OVER THE H5 RIDGE.  
CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY ADVANCE NORTHEAST TODAY WITH THE ETA 
H5 RH PANEL MATCHING FAIRLY WELL WITH OPAQUE CLOUDS.  CURRENT SKY 
CONDITION FCST STILL LOOKS GOOD FOR TODAY WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES 
PERSISTING IN THE SOUTH AND SKIES REMAINING PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE 
NORTH WITH OPAQUE CLOUDS TAKING MOST OF THE DAY TO REACH 
THERE.  

TONIGHTS/EARLY THURSDAYS CHANCE POPS IN THE SOUTH ALSO LOOK GOOD.  
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE SNOW NEAR CVG WITH MIXED PRECIP AROUND 
PORTSMOUTH.  MAJOR EVENT IS NOT EXPECTED WITH MOST PRECIP STAYING 
SOUTH AND EAST.  SKY CONDITION SHOULD IMPROVE TO PARTLY CLOUDY 
BY/DURING THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS MODELS INDICATE DRYING BY 18Z.

20Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY.  THIS RIDGE WILL STAY IN PLACE OVERNIGHT...THEN IT 
WILL BREAK DOWN AS LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS ACRS THE SRN STATES ON 
WEDNESDAY.  THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BE PERTURBED BY AN UPR 
LEVEL CLOSED LOW NOW MOVING INTO WRN TX.

FOR TONIGHT...HIGH LVL CLOUDINESS WILL CONTINUE TO SPILL OVER THE 
CWFA.  THE THICKEST CIRRUS SHOULD BE ACRS THE SRN CWFA.  AS A 
RESULT...SKIES WILL BE PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT.  THE 
CIRRUS SHOULD BE THIN ENOUGH TO ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP OFF TO FCST MOS 
TEMPERATURES.

ETA/AVN MODELS ARE IN SIMILAR AGREEMENT ON THE UPR LVL CLOSED LOW 
OVER WRN TX.  THIS LOW WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE SERN STATES WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT INTO THURSDAY.  MID LVL CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE FROM 
SOUTH TO NORTH ON WEDNESDAY.  LOOKING AT ETA MODEL SOUNDINGS AND 
ADJUSTING FOR CLOUD COVER...I AM GETTING FCST HIGHS CLOSE TO MOS 
GUIDANCE FOR WEDNESDAY...SO WILL NOT STRAY.

BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS AT 280 K TO 285 K YIELD 
CONDENSATION PRESSURE DEFICITS LESS THAN 30 MB ACRS THE SRN CWFA.  
THE ISENTROPIC LIFT IS WEAK (I.E. WAA IS WEAK).  HOWEVER...MODELS 
AGREE THAT THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH LIFT TO PRODUCE SOME LIGHT PCPN 
ACRS THE SRN CWFA.  THERE WILL BE A SHARP CUT OFF IN THE ISENTROPIC 
LIFT AND LOW CONDENSATION PRESSURE DEFICITS.  THE BIG QUESTION WILL 
BE WHAT KIND OF PCPN FALLS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING 
ACRS THE SRN CWFA.  THICKNESS SCHEMES ALONE ARE NOT DETAIL ENOUGH TO 
SEE WHAT IS GOING ON.  A CLOSE INSPECTION OF THE ETA MODEL SOUNDINGS 
INDICATED THAT PCPN WILL FIRST FALL INTO A DRY AIRMASS.  THE AIRMASS 
ACRS THE SWRN CWFA WILL EVENTUALLY BECOME SATURATED NEAR 0 C 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  THE MELTING DEPTH SHOULD BE SMALL ENOUGH THAT THE 
PCPN WILL BE SNOW THERE.  FOR THE SERN CWFA...RAIN MAY MIX 
IN...HOWEVER...I AM LEANING AGAINST THIS AS WAA IS NOT STRONG AND 
SOUNDINGS PORTEND A MAINLY WET SNOW EVENT.  WILL WORD SWRN CWFA AS 
CHC OF SNOW AND SERN CWFA AS CHC OF SNOW WITH A POSSIBLE MIX OF RAIN.

PCPN COMES TO AN END FROM WEST TO EAST BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  SKIES 
WILL CLEAR.  WITH FCST MODEL SOUNDINGS AND ACCOUNTING FOR CLOUDS...I 
AM ALSO GETTING TEMPS CLOSE TO MOS GUIDANCE.  THUS...HIGHS MAINLY IN 
THE LOWER 40S LOOK GOOD ATTM.

SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY...PROVIDING FOR MAINLY CLEAR SKIES AND WARMER THAN NORMAL 
TEMPS.

NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE REGION WILL MOVE INTO THE CWFA LATE 
SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY MORNING...BRINGING A CHC OF SHOWERS.  A CHC OF

WITH MUCH COLDER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT (-16 C AT 850 MB) MOVING OVER

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS AFTN SHOWED TWO S/WVS OR VORT MAXES OVER 
THE UPR MS RIVER VLY AND WRN GREAT LAKES.  THESE TWO S/WVS WILL 
BRING MUCH COLDER WEATHER TO REGION ON MONDAY.  THE ASSOCD ARCTIC

AND EXIT THE ERN CWFA AFTER 06Z.  MSTR ASSOCD WITH THE FRONT IS 
PALTRY...SO I AM ONLY EXPECTING PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT.  
WITH MUCH COLDER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT (-16 C AT 850 MB) MOVING OVER

THE GREAT LAKES WILL PRODUCE INSTABILITY SNOW SHOWERS ACRS THE

STATIONARY RUNNING FROM NEAR MIE-MFD AT 19Z....WITH MAIN LOW DOWN IN 
ARKANSAS. LOW WILL TRACK ALONG THE FRONT...BRINGING A SWATH OF HEAVY 
RAIN TO THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE FA.  DONT KNOW IF 6 HOURS WILL BE 
REACHED...BUT ONE HOUR AMOUNTS ARE GENERALLY LESS THAN AN INCH.  
THESE VALUES COULD BE PASSED...ESPECIALLY IN THE CONVECTION.

LOW IN IN WESTERN PA BY 12Z...WITH FRONT THROUGH MUCH OF OHIO.  WILL 
LOWER POPS FOR TOMORROW DUE TO SPEED OF FRONT.  EXPECT A FEW

INTO NW 1/4 OF CWA BY 0Z...AND WILL MENTION A DROP IN TEMPS THIS PM 
HERE. 

FOR PRECIP...MOST MODELS ARE INDICATING A SHOT OF SHOWERS AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT WHICH I WOULD TEND TO DISAGREE WITH. ONLY FORCING AROUND 
IS GOING TO COME FROM THE FRONT ITSELF AND THE OVERRUNNING INTO THE 
COLD AIR POOL BEHIND IT...NOT AHEAD OF IT. 

THERES CHANCE POPS RUNNING IN THE SOUTHEAST TONIGHT...AND 
CATEGORICAL ELSEWHERE. WILL BUMP SOUTHEAST TO LIKELY AS FRONT SHOULD 
BE OVERTOP OF OHIO RIVER BY 12Z WED. AM NOT EXPECTING TOO MUCH THIS 
AFTERNOON...WILL CONTINUE THE 30 POPS AND MENTION SCATTERED NATURE 
OF SHOWER ACTIVITY. 

MISILN OUT SOON.

MDLS BEGINNING TO CONVERGE ON A SOLN ON THE POSITION AND TIMING OF 
VARIOUS WAVES AND THE COLD FRONT AS IT AFFECTS THE AREA THROUGH 
FRIDAY. DIFFERENCES OCCUR WITH COLD AIR MOVING IN AND AGREE WITH 
CONSENSUS THAT ETA HAS BEST HANDLE ON THAT ASPECT. 

TODAY WILL CONTINUE TO SEE HIGH DEWPOINTS MOVE INTO AREA AND WEAK 
BOUNDARY SLIDE ACROSS CWFA. THIS COULD TRIGGER SOME SHOWERS ESP THIS 
AFTN. CLOUDS WILL BE FARILY PREVALENT BUT WITH TEMPS ALREADY 55 TO 
60...TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S IS MORE THAN REASONABLE. TONIGHT 
BOUNDARY WILL SLIDE SOUTH AND LLVL JET WILL DEVELOP ALLOWING FOR 
EXCELLENT CONVERGENCE ALONG THE BOUNDARY. WITH GOOD MSTR RISING OVER 
BOUNDARY...RAIN WILL DEVELOP GENERALLY NORTH OF CARROLLTON TO 
CHILLICOTHE LINE. WILL HAVE A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT DELINEATION OF 
TEMPS/POPS ALONG THE BOUNDARY WITH CHC/WARM SOUTH AND CAT/COOL 
NORTH. 

WED LOOKS LIKE A RAINY AND COOL DAY BEFORE BOUNDARY HEADS NORTH AS A 
WRM FRONT WED NITE. TEMPS SHOULD RISE OVERNIGHT AS A RESULT AND RAIN 
CHC WILL DECREASE. MOST OF AREA IN WARM SECTOR MUCH OF THE DAY THU 
BEFORE COLD FRONT COMES THRU IN EARNEST THU AFTN/NITE. SIG FALL IN 
TEMPS WILL OCCUR WITH RAIN MIXING WITH/CHG TO SNOW BY FRI NOON.

DIVERGE DRAMATICALLY.  ETA/NGM ARE AGGRESSIVE WITH BRINGING COLD

THE ETA SEEMS TO HANDLE THE ARCTIC AIR BETTER.  THE MAIN REASON IS 
THESE MODELS ARE ALL PICKING UP ON THE UPPER LEVEL WAVE THAT IS

RACE EAST. JETLET OFF OF MAIN JET WILL TRACK ACROSS SOUTHERN OHIO 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND WILL HELP ENHANCE UPWARD VERTICAL MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE AREA. SURFACE COLD FRONT LIES WELL NORTH OF THE AREA 
ACROSS CENTRAL LAKE MICHIGAN AND NORTHERN MICHIGAN.  THE FRONT IS 
EXPECTED TO MAKE A SLOW TRACK TO THE SOUTH AS WAVE OF SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST ALONG THE FRONT. THE COMBINATION OF THE 
BOUNDARY AND THE LOW WILL SET THE STAGE FOR SOME OVERRUNNING 
PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE AREA OVERNIGHT.  ALL OF THESE FACTORS WILL 
WORK TOGETHER IN PRODUCING SOME PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN TONIGHT. WILL 
MENTION SHOWERS DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT WITH RAIN HEAVY AT TIMES AND 
WILL ALSO MENTION A CHANCE OF A THUNDERSTORM AS INSTABILITY 
INCREASES. FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE IS CURRENTLY RUNNING ABOUT 2 TO 3 
INCHES FOR 12 HOURS ACROSS THE AREA. EXPECTING ABOUT 1 TO 2 INCHES 
OF RAIN OVER THE AREA BETWEEN MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AND NOON TOMORROW.  
WILL HOLD OFF ON ISSUING A FLOOD WATCH FOR NOW. 

THEN FOR THURSDAY AS LOW MOVES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST...SURFACE COLD 
FRONT WILL SHIFT SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA AROUND SUNRISE.  THIS 
WILL SHIFT WINDS AROUND TO THE NORTH AND EARLY HIGHS WILL BE THE 
LOWS FOR TONIGHT.  STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL TAKE PLACE AND 
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE 30S BY EVENING ON 
THURSDAY.  DRIER AIR IS FORCED INTO THE AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS AND SKIES SHOULD BECOME PARTLY SUNNY. 

STRONG SURFACE RIDGE WILL EXTEND EAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY REGION 
THURSDAY NGIHT AND PERSIST ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
AFTER A BRIEF COOL DOWN ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...TEMPERATURES ARE 
EXPECTED TO REBOUND BACK TO THE 50S OVER THE WEEKEND INTO THE EARLY

AFTER A BRIEF COOL DOWN ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...TEMPERATURES ARE 
EXPECTED TO REBOUND BACK TO THE 50S OVER THE WEEKEND INTO THE EARLY 
PART OF NEXT WEEK. NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL

LATEST RADAR AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW THE PRECIPITATION MOVING 
OFF TO THE EAST AND AWAY FROM THE AREA. SHOWERS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH 
SHORTWAVE AND MOISTURE MOVING EAST ACROSS SOUTHERN OHIO. DRIER AIR 
AND NVA ARE SPREADING EAST ACROSS THE AREA FROM THE WEST IN THE MID 
AND UPPER LEVELS. HOWEVER...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BELOW 850 MB WILL 
REMAIN AT 90 PERCENT INTO TONIGHT. SO...WILL KEEP THE AREA CLOUDY 
THROUGH TODAY. 

TEMPERATURES LOOK GOOD SO FAR WITH SOUTHWESTERLY WARM FLOW SO WILL 
NOT MAKE ANY ADJUSTMENTS THERE AT THIS TIME.

PRELIMINARY UPDATE ZONES ARE OUT NOW. WILL SEND UPDATED ZONES OUT 
SHORTLY.

150 AM EST WED JAN 23 2002

LOOKS LIKE THIS MORNINGS MODEL SOLUTIONS ARE A BIT OF A MERGER FROM 
LAST NIGHTS. SFC FRONT MOVING THROUGH FCST AREA OVERNIGHT TONIGHT 
IS STILL STRETCHED OUT...BUT A LOW DOES RIDE UP THE WAVE AND IS 
OVERTOP OF SERN THIRD OF FA AT 12Z THURS. THIS SHOULD BRING COPIOUS 
RAINFALL TO THIS REGION AROUND THIS TIME...BUT NWRN CUTOFF IS PRETTY 
PRONOUNCED AND ANY INCREASE IN SPEED OF THE SFC LOW WOULD REALLY 
DECREASE PRECIP AMOUNTS. HOWEVER...FROM THE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS 
NOTED BETWEEN THE ETA AND AVN LAST NIGHT...THE ALL AROUND 
SIMILARITIES WITH THIS FEATURE ON TONIGHTS MODEL RUNS IS IMPRESSIVE 
AND I CANT BELIEVE THAT QPF FIELDS WILL BE THAT FAR OFF.

LIGHTNING THIS MORNING IS GENERALLY WHERE ETA SHOWS 30+ K INDICES 
WITH EXCEPTION OF STRIKES NR CHITOWN WHICH ARE MORE IN LINE WITH AN 
INCREASE IN KS WITH ADDED ENHANCEMENT OF A VORT MAX. WITH KS 30 OR 
BETTER OVER SERN 1/2 OF FCST AREA TODAY...WILL HAVE TO INCLUDE 
ISOLATED CHANCE OF THUNDER IN ZONES BUT AM INCLINED TO PLAY IT DOWN.

FOR TODAY...AM NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH ODDS OF PRECIP N OF OH RIVER 
AND WILL KEEP THE 40 AND 50 POPS WE ALREADY HAVE RUNNING BUT MAKE 
THE RAIN SCATTERED. WITH PRECIP EFFICIENCIES ABOVE .9 IN AN INCH OR 
BETTER PWAT OVER ALL BUT FAR NWRN FCST AREA FROM 6 TO 12Z 
TONIGHT...WILL THROW IN HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE IN SRN 1/4 OF FCST AREA 
AS NOTED BY ETA AND NGM. DONT EXPECT THE MAX PRECIP TO BE AS FAR NW 
AS AVN SUGGESTS. RAIN SHOULD TURN OFF QUICKLY ON THURSDAY 
MORNING...AND WILL NOT HAVE ANY POPS IN NW ZONES...RANGING TO 
CATEGORICAL IN THE SOUTHEAST ENDING BY NOON.

FOR TEMPS...CURRENT READINGS ARE BEST NOTED ON AVN/NGM WITH ETA 
BEING ABOUT 5 DEGREES TOO COLD AT 6Z. FWC NUMBERS SEEM A BIT TOO 
COLD AND FCST SOUNDING AT ILN FOR 21Z TODAY YIELDS A HIGH OF 64. AS 
IM ALREADY THINKING OF LITTLE PRECIP...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE 
WARMER AVN GUIDANCE. WITH PASSAGE OF SFC FRONT...EXPECT NEARLY 
STEADY TEMPS TONIGHT IN THE LOW 50S IN MORE OR LESS CONSTANT RAIN 
FOR SOUTHEAST AFTER AN EARLY DROPOFF. H9 TEMPS REMAIN +12 IN THIS 
AREA THROUGH 12Z. IN NORTH AND WEST...WILL GO WITH A LOW AROUND 40 
OR THE LOW 40S AS H9 TEMPS REMAIN ABOVE +4. FOR DAYTIME HOURS ON 
THURSDAY...LITTLE RECOVERY EXPECTED SO WILL KEEP THE EARLY HIGHS AND 
STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS. EXPECT TO LEAN TOWARDS COOLER 
OVERNIGHT LOWS THURS NIGHT WITH THERMAL TROF PASSAGE COOINCIDING 
WITH SFC RIDGE. EVEN WITH MAINLY CLEAR SKIES EXPECTED FRIDAY...WILL 
LEAN A LITTLE BELOW FAN/MAV GUIDANCE ON FRIDAYS HIGHS...RANGING 
FROM THE UPPER 30S NW TO AROUND 45 SOUTHEAST.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES BROAD STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE

TEMPERATURES APPEARED TO HAVE STEADIED OUT OVER THE PAST TWO HOURS 
OVER FA.

18Z AND NEW 00Z ETA RUN SHOWING BEST AREAL COVERAGE WILL BE ACROSS 
SOUTHERN FA WITH THE BEST LOWER LEVEL CONVERGENCE.  ALSO BEST 
THETA-E ADVECTION STAYS NEAR THE OHIO RIVER.  LATEST TRENDS FROM 
REGIONAL RADARS ALSO INDICATE THAT BEST COVERAGE AND HEAVIEST RAIN 
WILL BE ACROSS SOUTHERN FA.  AS A RESULT WILL CUT BACK POPS TO 
CHANCE ACROSS THE NORTH WHERE LESS ORGANIZED AND MORE SCATTERED 
SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED.

THANKS TO CLE AND IND FOR COORD.

SFC HI PRESSURE TRACKS OFF OF THE COAST THROUGH EARLY FCST PERIOD 
AND RIDGE LINES UP THROUGH FLORIDA TOWARDS MEXICO. WITH THE SFC 
RIDGE HERE...GULF REALLY OPENS UP AND MOISTURE STREAMS TOWARDS SRN 
OH VLY. ISENTROPIC LIFT THROUGH THE ENTIRE REGION IS QUITE EVIDENT 
AND LIFTING OF THE MOIST GULF AIR GETS AN ADDED KICK WITH VARIOUS 
VORTS SWINGING THROUGH ZONAL SW FLOW AT H5. WITH LACK OF UPPER 
SUPPORT...NO SHOWERS MENTIONED...JUST RAIN.

PROBLEMS HERE WOULD BE TIMING OF VORTS AHEAD OF SFC FRONTAL SYSTEM 
PROGGED TO GO THROUGH CWA AND STRETCH FROM NRN MID ATLANTIC SW 
THROUGH WV-KY BORDER AND INTO ERN TX BY 12Z THURS. NCEP FOLKS 
SUGGEST ETAS SFC FEATURES VS AVN SINCE AVN HAS HELD UP AND CUT OFF 
SFC LOW IN WRN NY-PA AT THIS TIME.

ZONAL SW H7 AND H5 FLOW THROUGH FCST PERIOD WOULD SUGGEST NOT 
CUTTING OFF SFC LOW AND FEEL THAT THE MORE STRETCHED OUT SFC FRONT 
WOULD BE MORE AGREEABLE AS SUGGESTED BY ETA. CUTOFF LOW IN NY-PA AS 
WITH STRONG SOUTHWEST FLOW SEEMS INCONSISTENT.

EVEN WITH PASSAGE OF SFC FRONT...PRECIP SHOULD CONTINUE AS H8 TROF 
LAGS QUITE A BIT BEHIND IT. BEST MOISTURE CONVERGENCE SHOULD OCCUR 
OVER SERN HALF OF FCST AREA EARLY ON THURS...BUT AM UNSURE HOW MUCH 
MOISTURE IS GOING TO ACTUALLY WRING OUT OVER THE NORTHWEST AFTER 
FROPA. WILL DROP POPS HERE AND MENTION STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING 
TEMPS THROUGH THE DAY FOR ALL BUT SERN FCST AREA. DONT THINK THAT 
THERES GOING TO BE TOO MUCH IN THE LINE OF PRECIP BEHIND FRONT. 
WILL DROP POPS ALL AREAS AND HAVE ONLY AN EARLY MENTION OF 
RAIN...REMOVING POPS ENTIRELY THURS NITE AS STRONG SFC RIDGE BUILDS 
IN FROM THE WEST.

MAJOR DIFFERENCE IN THE MODELS WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WILL AFFECT THE

ETA HAS BEEN ERRATIC WITH WITH POSITION OF THE SURFACE LOW.  MOST 
RECENT RUN PUSHES IT INTO CENTRAL WEST VIRGINIA BY 18Z SATURDAY.  
AVN MEANWHILE KEEPS SURFACE LOW IN THE WESTERN CAROLINAS.  ETA IS 
ALSO QUICKER WITH THE 500 MB SHORTWAVE AS COMPARED TO THE AVN/NGM.  
PERFER THE AVN SOLUTION...AS IT HAS BEEN MOST CONSISTENT OVER THE 
LAST COUPLE OF RUNS.  IN ADDITION...IT HAS HANDLED MOST SYSTEMS 
THIS WINTER BETTER THAN THE ETA.

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN TODAY...FA SHOULD SEE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES.  
CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE WITH SNOW ENTERING THE FA AFTER 06Z.  
WILL GO WITH 1 TO 3 TONIGHT IN THE EXTREME SOUTH.  WITH THE SYSTEM 
BEING A QUICK MOVER....ACCUMULATING SNOWS WILL END IN THE WEST BY 
NOON.  IN CENTRAL OHIO...1-2 INCHES COULD FALL.  ACROSS SOUTH 
CNETRAL OHIO/NE KY...WARMER AIR WILL WORK...CHANGING THE SNOW TO

18Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A COLD FRONT EAST OF THE APPALACHIAN 
SPINE.  MEANWHILE...A WEAK COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED ACRS NRN MN INTO 
NRN ND.  IN BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS WAS AN EAST/WEST RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE FROM WRN OHIO WEST INTO NRN MO.  ON THE WATER VAPOR...AREAS 
OF SHEARED/CHANNELED VORTICITY WERE LOCATED ABOVE KS/MO.  ALSO...A 
S/WV WAS MOVING INTO THE GREAT BASIN.

AVN/ETA MODELS ARE IN SIMILAR AGREEMENT WITH SENSIBLE WX ELEMENTS 
FOR THE NEXT 60 HRS.  THE ONLY DIFFERENCE WAS THE SPEED AND AMOUNT 
OF LIFT EXPECTED ON SATURDAY FROM A COUPLE OF S/WVS APCHING FROM THE 
WEST...MOVING ACRS THE TN/OH VLYS.  FOR TONIGHT...AREA OF 
SHEARED/CHANNELED VORTICITY WILL MOVE ACRS THE REGION...BRING MOSTLY 
CLOUDY TO CLOUDY CONDITIONS THIS EVENING.  AS THE SHEARED VORTICITY 
MOVES EAST OF THE REGION BETWEEN 06Z-12Z...THE MAINLY MID TO HIGH 
LVL MSTR WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE.  THE SHEARED AREA OF VORTICITY WILL 
BE HELPED ALONG BY A S/WV DROPPING INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION.  
THIS S/WV WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT ACRS 
MN/ND.  THIS FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION TOMORROW MORNING 
WITH LITTLE FAN FARE.  THUS...OTHER THAN SOME SC BEHIND THE FRONT IN 
THE WEAK CAA...SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY.

AS MENTIONED PREVIOUSLY...CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE FRIDAY 
NIGHT AS A TANDEM OF S/WVS MOVE TOWARD THE OH/TN VLYS.  THE ETA/AVN 
INDICATE DEEPENING MOISTURE IN THE LOW LEVELS AS WELL AS 
WAA/ISENTROPIC LIFT BY SATURDAY MORNING.  THE AVN IS A LITTLE 
STRONGER WITH THE S/WVS AND THUS WITH THE LIFT.  THE ETA IS SOMEWHAT 
WEAKER WITH THE S/WVS.  REGARDLESS OF MODEL CHOICE...SNOW SHOULD 
BREAK OUT ACRS THE SWRN CWFA TOWARD SATURDAY MORNING...MOVING TOWARD 
THE ENE.  THIS FCST SNOW SWATH IS SIMILAR TO THE LAST MEASURABLE 
SNOW WE HAD ON JANUARY 5TH.  THUS...HIGHEST POPS WILL BE PLACED ACRS 
THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST CWFA WITH DECREASING CHC/S TOWARD THE 
NORTHWEST.  SNOW SHOULD BEGIN TO TAPER OFF TO FLURRIES IN THE WEST 
DURING THE AFTN.  AS OF NOW...LITTLE ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED FAR NW 
WITH MAYBE AN INCH OR TWO ACRS THE SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEASTERN CWFA 
DURING THE DAY SATURDAY.

SKIES WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY SATURDAY NIGHT AS SFC HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS INTO THE REGION.  SFC HIGH PRESSURE ON SUNDAY WILL BRING 
PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS WITH NEAR SEASONAL TEMPS.

A COUPLE OF COLD FRONTS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION NEXT WEEK WITH 
THE FIRST ONE EXPECTED MONDAY DAY MORNING AND THE OTHER AROUND 
TUESDAY NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY.  BOTH FRONTS ARE STARVED FOR MOISTURE. 
MRF TRIES TO DEVELOP A MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM BY THURSDAY.  GIVEN 
THIS IS ON DAY SEVEN AND THE TREND TO KEEP A ZONAL FLOW ACRS THE

SFC HI BUILDING S OF FCST AREA TONIGHT WITH THERMAL TROF SLIDING 
EAST JUST AHEAD OF THE RIDGE AXIS OF HI. WILL NOT GET FANCY TONIGHT 
WITH LOWS AND STAY WITH MOS AS ALMOST ALL MODELS ARE GIVING MID 20S 
ACROSS FCST AREA. WOULD THINK THAT CLOUDS WOULD KEEP TEMPS ON THE UP 
SIDE...BUT LOWS SHOULD JUST BE A REFLECTION OF SFC ADVECTION.

ON WEDNESDAY...WILL LOWER THE 30 POPS FROM NW FCST AREA...ESPECIALLY 
SINCE THE AFTERNOON IN THE FAR NORTHWEST HAS AN INCH OF ACCUMULATION 
DURING THIS TIME FRAME. I BELIEVE THAT THE BEST FORCING THROUGH THIS 
TIME WILL BE TO THE NORTH...AND THE TIMING FROM MOST OF THE MODELS 
IS FOR AN EVENING/OVERNIGHT EVENT. 

THE TRICKY PART HERE ISNT NECESSARILY THE TIMING. THICKNESSES AND 
WARMING AHEAD OF THE LOW MAKE PTYPE A LITTLE FUZZY. RIGHT NOW...THE 
LOW TRACKS JUST NORTH OF THE FCST AREA...AND I BELIEVE THAT MOST OF 
THE CWA WILL SEE SNOW LATE...BEGINNING AS A PERIOD OF RAIN. IN THE 
NORTHWEST...IM GOING WITH ALL SN POSSIBLY MIXED WITH RA AT FIRST. 
CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD SEE A PERIOD OF RA 
CHANGING TO SN. THIS WILL BE A LATE CHANGEOVER IN CMH ZONES...AND 
WILL KEEP SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO AND NE KY ALL RAIN. AS FOR 
ACCUMULATIONS...THE AXIS OF HIGHEST PRECIP (.1) TRACKS FROM 
LIMA/WAPAKONETA AND SKIMS THROUGH CMH AND NE FCST AREA. WILL NOT 
KEEP MUCH IN ACCUMULATION...AN INCH NORTHWEST WITH MAINLY ALL 
SNOW...UP TO (OR LESS THAN) AN INCH DAY TO CMH...LITTLE IF ANY ACCUM 
AROUND CVG AND NOTHING IN THE SOUTHEAST. 

WITH THE SLOWER TIMING, WE COULD SEE A LINGERING SHOWER OVER THE 
EAST AND SOUTH EARLY ON THURSDAY. WILL HAVE LOW CHANCE POPS IN HERE.

AFTER THIS, PROBLEM LIES WITH AVN MODEL LEAVING BOUNDARY TO THE 
SOUTHEAST. NEXT SYSTEM WANTS TO SET UP A WARM FRONT AND RIDE A SFC 
LOW ALONG THIS BOUNDARY ON FRIDAY, WITH A MORE DEVELOPED LOW MOVING 
FROM THE GULF TO THE EAST COAST BETWEEN 12 AND 18Z SATURDAY. I DONT 
BELIEVE THAT IT WILL BE QUITE THAT FAR SOUTH EVEN THOUGH HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE IS PROGGED TO BUILD INTO FCST AREA FROM THE WEST. 
ALSO, TIMING ISNT QUITE AS REALISTIC IN MY EYES. WILL KEEP POPS IN 
ON SATURDAY FOR THE SOUTH, REMOVING THEM FROM THE NORTH. THIS MAY BE 
A FLIP-FLOP ISSUE IN FUTURE FORECASTS.

DONT EXPECT TO STRAY TOO FAR FROM NUMERICAL GUIDANCE. EXTENDED FCST 
HAS LOW CONFIDENCE AS SYSTEMS PASS TO THE NORTH OF FCST AREA AROUND 
LARGER LOW PRESSURE OVER HUDSON BAY. W-E ORIENTED HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE SHOULD HOLD SWAY OVER SRN FCST AREA...SO EXPECT TO LEAN COOLER

WITH QPF OVER CWA AT 18Z NOTED ON MOST 12Z MODEL RUNS...AM INCLINED 
TO BELIEVE THAT PRECIP SHOULD BE LOCATED JUST ALONG THE TRACK OF THE 
LOW TONIGHT WHERE FORCING IS BEST. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE JUST ISNT 
ENOUGH. WILL WORD AS WIDELY SCT THROUGH MIDNIGHT IN THE SOUTH AND 
KEEP THE 30 POPS IN THE NORTH WITH A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW AFTER 
MIDNIGHT.

CAA SETS UP FOR TUESDAY AND TEMPERATURES MAY EXPERIENCE A SLIGHT 
RISE AFTER DAYBREAK IN THE SOUTHEAST...BUT NO RECOVERY AND POSSIBLY 
A SLOW DROP THROUGH THE DAY IN THE NORTH HALF. WILL WORD WITH STEADY 
OR SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS AFTER EARLY HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 30S. 
FLURRIES EXPECTED THROUGH THE DAY FOR NORTH HALF ENDING WEST TO 
EAST. DRIER AIR WORKS IN FOR A LITTLE OVERNIGHT...WITH COOLEST PM 
LOWS EXPECTED IN THE SOUTHWEST. WAA STARTS TO KICK BACK IN ON WED... 
BUT CLOUD COVER AND COOL START SHOULD ONLY ALLOW MID TO UPPER 30S.

CANT DISCERN BETWEEN EITHER SNOW OR RAIN FOR SYSTEMS PUSHING 
THROUGH WED PM AND ON FRI PM. WILL MAINTAIN WORDING AS BOTH WITH 
EXCEPTION OF NORTHWEST WHERE SNOW SHOULD PREVAIL...POSSIBLY MIXING 
WITH RAIN EARLY IN THE WARM SECTOR.

AFTER THIS...CONFIDENCE DROPS AS ZONAL FLOW IS DIFFICULT TO TIME IN  
MOISTURE AT ANY PARTICULAR LEVEL. WILL MAINTAIN BELOW NORMAL TEMPS 
WITH DRY THINKING AND TRY TO MINIMIZE PRECIP WITH EXCEPTION OF THE 
SYSTEM FRI PM INTO EARLY SATURDAY. 

LOOKING AT THE EXTENDED...MODELS SEEM TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
LITTLE CHANGE IN LONGWAVE PATTERN OVER THE NORTHERN HEMISPHERE. ONLY 
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES AT THE SFC DUE TO TIMING IN ZONAL FLOW WOULD BE 
EXPECTED WITH OVERALL AGREEMENT AT H5. PACIFIC MOISUTRE SEEMS TO BE 
THE ONLY MOISTURE TO WORK WITH THROUGH THE FCST PERIOD SINCE THE 
WEAKER SFC LOWS NEVER SEEM TO BE ABLE TO GET A GOOD TAP ON GULF

WILL PLAY DOWN THE CHANCE OF RAIN TODAY ESPECIALLY IN THE EAST AND 
MENTION LATE WORDING AS DRY LOWER LEVELS AND WEAK LIFT SHOULD ONLY 
ALLOW A GRADUAL MOISTENING OF THE ATMOSPHERE. EXPECT TO MENTION THIS 
AS SPRINKLES FOR THE MIDDLE SECTION OF CWA AND LIGHT RAIN SOUTH. 
TIMING IS A BIT LATER FOR PASSAGE OF TROF...AND THINK THAT ANY 
PRECIP TAKING PLACE OVERNIGHT WILL STILL BE LIQUID AS LOW LEVEL 
THICKNESS DONT SUPPORT FREEZING OR FROZEN PRECIP UNTIL AFTER ITS 
THROUGH AT 12Z. MODELS HAVE WARMED UP QUITE A BIT TODAY...AND WILL 
LIKELY GO NEAR GUIDANCE. TEMPS ARE GOING TO START OUT WARM...BUT 
CLOUD COVER AND COOLING ALOFT SHOULD PUT A CAP ON TODAYS HIGHS. 

AFTER SFC TROF PUSHES THROUGH TONIGHT...NW FLOW BRINGS CAA INTO PLAY 
ON FRIDAY...BUT AM WORRIED ABOUT HOW MUCH CLOUD COVER THERE WILL BE. 
ATMOSPHERE GENERALLY DRY AFTER THE TROF...BUT ETA HOLDS ON TO H9 
MOISTURE AND MIXING SHOULD CU THINGS UP QUITE A BIT. WILL CONTINUE 
WITH THE MOCLDY IN FCST AND KEEP A LOW DIURNAL OF AROUND 5-8 DEGREES.

CHANCE OF SNOW MENTIONED SAT PM LOOKS LIKE AN AFTERNOON INTO EVENING

WAKE.  AFTER THE TROF MOVES OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC...H5 FLOW WILL 
BECOME MORE ZONAL BY WEDNESDAY RESULTING IN WARMER WX.

SFC MAP SHOWS PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER OHIO VALLEY BETWEEN COASTAL LOW 
AND TEXAS HIGH.  NORTHWEST WINDS ARE ADVECTING COLDER TEMPS FOR 
TONIGHT.  HIGH WILL DROP SOUTHEAST INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO BY 
TUESDAY...WITH A FRONT ENTERING THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES.  OUR AREA 
WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A SFC RIDGE EXTENDING NORTHEAST FROM 
THE GULF ON TUESDAY...WITH THE SFC FLOW BACKING TO SOUTHWEST AND 
GIVING US WARM ADVECTION.  THE FRONT WILL APPROACH AND THEN CROSS 
OUR REGION ON WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY.

SKIES SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY EARLY TONIGHT UNTIL FLOW AT 850 MB 
BACKS TO WEST AND LAKE MOISTURE IS CUT OFF.  AFTER SKIES BECOME 
MOSTLY CLEAR BY LATE TONIGHT...MOSTLY SUNNY STILL LOOKS GOOD FOR 
TUESDAY...THOUGH ILL MENTION INCREASING CLOUDS WEST AS MID LEVEL 
CLOUDS CURRENTLY OVER SOUTH DAKOTA SHOULD ARRIVE ON TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON.  BECOMING MOSTLY CLOUDY STILL SOUNDS GOOD FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  THOUGH THE ETA IS DRY FOR WEDNESDAY...AVN 
AND NGM HINT AT SCT SHRA SO ILL KEEP 30 POPS.  

GUIDANCE TEMPS GENERALLY AGREE ON WARMING TREND OVER NEXT TWO DAYS.  
FWC LOOKS TOO WARM IN PRESENCE OF SNOW COVER SO ILL TEND TOWARD THE 
COOLER MAV.

EXTENDED: SUCCESSION OF SHORT WAVES COULD MAKE THINGS INTERESTING 
FOR THE WEEKEND.  FMR TEMPS LOOK TOO WARM WRT SFC PATTERN SO ILL 
UNDERCUT THEM BY ABOUT 1 CAT.

MODELS HAVE COME INTO AGREEMENT ON TRACK OF SURFACE LOW...TAKING IT 
ALONG THE SOUTHERLY TRACK THAT THE AVN/MRF HAS BEEN FORECASTING FOR 
THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.  THAT TRACK WOULD TAKE IT SOUTH OF 
ATLANTA...THOUGH SOUTH CAROLINA THEN OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA 
COAST.  AVN IS QUICKEST IN PULLING THE SURFACE LOW TO THE EAST.  
PREFER A LITTLE SLOWER SOLUTION...BUT NOT AS SLOW AS NGM.

850 LOW TRACKS A LITTLE FARTHER WEST...ALONG THE EASTERN EDGE OF 
THE APPALACHIANS.  THIS WOULD BUT THE HEAVIEST SNOWS JUST WEST OF 
THE APPALACHIANS...THROUGH EASTERN KY AND INTO WEST VIRGINIA. 

TRIED TO USE THE GARCIA METHOD TO GET A FEEL FOR SNOW AMOUNTS. AT 
THE 290K LEVEL...WHICH RAN THROUGH THE 700 MB LEVEL...MOST OF THE FA 
HAD NO LIFT...SOUTH CENTRAL OHIO AND NE KENTUCKY DID HAVE SOME WEAK 
LIFT THROUGH.  THE SE AVERAGED A MIXING RATIO OF 2.5.  THAT WOULD 
HAVE GIVIEN A MAX OF 5 INCHES IF THE LIFT WAS THERE.  WITH THE LACK 
OF LIFT DONT REALLY EXPECT MORE THAN 1 TO 3 INCHES.  ELSEWHERE 1 TO 
2.

WONT ISSUE AN ADVISORY FOR THE SE RIGHT NOW.  WITH THE ACCUMULATING 
SNOW COMING IN DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY...THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF 
TIME FOR THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT TO FINE TUNE IT.

WILL A LITTLE SLOW SURFACE LOW EXPECTED AND UPPER TROF YET TO SWING 
THROUGH...WILL LINGER SOME SNOW INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT BECOMING 
PARTLY CLOUDY ON MONDAY STILL LOOKS GOOD.  AVN HAS A STRONG 
SHORTWAVE DIVING INTO OHIO LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...ALSO 
THERE IS GOOD WAA.  WILL MENTION SOME FLURRIES IN THE NORTH FOR

NO NEW 00Z GUIDANCE YET...BUT 18Z RUNS MADE SOME INTERESTING

REMAINS WELL TO THE SE OVER THE CAROLINAS...ALTHOUGH THE 18Z RUN DID 
TREND A LITTLE FURTHER NW.  THE ECMWF...WHICH HAS BEEN PRETTY 
CONSISTENT WITH THIS SYS FOR SVRL DAYS...HAS SLOWED NOTABLY(STILL 
OVER AL AT 12Z SUN) BUT CONTINUES ALONG A TRACK ABOUT MIDWAY BETWEEN

INTERACTION OF DIGGING NORTHERN STREAM ENERGY (100-110KT JET AT 
250MB AT 00Z OVER BC IS A LTL STRONGER THAN MOST OF THE PREV GUID 
INDICATED) WITH THE VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE CURRENTLY OVER NM.  THE 
TREND...ESPLY ON THE ETA...IS TO DIG THE NORTHERN STREAM JET FURTHER 
WEST WITH EACH RUN AND EJECT THE SOUTHERN STREAM ENERGY MORE TO THE 
NORTH.  AT ANY RATE...GULF WL BE WIDE OPEN FOR A TIME WITH THIS ONE

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES SURFACE RIDGE FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS

HALF OF FA.  TDS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE SINGLE DIGITS.

MODELS ARE ALL RELATIVELY SIMILAR OVER FA THROUGH 36 HRS.  48 TO 60

TROF...ESPECIALLY ALONG THE EAST COAST.  THIS DIFFERENCE ONLY BRINGS 
SOME MINOR DIFFERENCES OVER OHIO VALLEY.  DPROG/DT INDICATES THE AVN 
IN MOST CONSISTENT WITH MAJOR FEATURES BUT WITH A SLIGHTLY SLOWER 
SOLUTION.  THE ETA HAS BEEN SLOWING OVER THE PAST 3 RUNS.  WILL GO 
WITH A COMPROMISE OVER FA SINCE DIFFERENCES OVER FA IS MUCH LESS 
NOTICEABLE.

UPPER LOW IS CARVED OUT OF LARGE TROF WHICH EXTENDS INTO THE GREAT 
LAKES.  THIS LOW WILL DIVE SOUTH AND SWING THROUGH AS AN UPPER TROF 
ACROSS FA DURING THE DAY THURSDAY.  UPPER LOW IS MOISTURE STARVED AS 
IS EVIDENT BY AMOUNT OF PRECIP AND CLOUDINESS CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED 
WITH FEATURE.  BEST MOISTURE STAYS WILL UPPER LOW WHICH MOVES TO THE 
WEST AND SOUTH OF FA.  LOW LEVEL FLOW IS DIVERGENT OFF THE LAKES.  
AS A RESULT WILL GO WITH PC TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVER FA 
OVERNIGHT.  STRATA CU FIELD OVER NORTHERN FA LOOKS PRETTY CELLULAR 
AND SHOULD MIX OUT TO SOME DEGREE.  WILL CUT BACK MENTION OF 
FLURRIES TO WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH THE PASSAGE OF UPPER TROF.  AS LOW 
DEVELOPS ALONG THE EAST COAST SOME OVERRUNNING CLOUDS CAN BE 
EXPECTED OVER MOST OF FA WITH THE THICKEST ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST.  
WILL SLOWLY IMPROVE SKY COVER ON THURSDAY AS THE LOW KICKS 
NORTHEASTWARD UP THE COAST.

FWC TEMPS LOOK GOOD FOR THE MIDDLE TWO PERIODS.  TONIGHT CONCERNED 
ABOUT DROPPING INTO SINGLE DIGITS BUT CLOUDS HAVE BEEN A REAL BEAR 
SO WILL DROP GUIDANCE IN THE WEST BY A CAT OR TWO.  WILL STICK CLOSE 
IN THE EAST PER FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE COULD KEEP A BETTER CLOUD DECK.

14Z SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTED A SFC TROF FROM CNTRL MI...ACRS SRN LAKE 
HURON...SRN ONTARIO...THEN INTO LAKE ONTARIO.  ANOTHER SUBTLE SFC 
TROF WAS INDICATED ACRS LAKE ERIE.  OTHERWISE...WEAK SFC RIDGING 
EXITS OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE FCST AREA.

WATER VAPOR THIS AM SHOWS THAT WE ARE NOW BETWEEN SHEAR VORTICITY 
AREAS.  THUS...ANYTHING THAT OCCURS TODAY WILL BE THE RESULT OF LOW 
LEVEL FLOW AND MSTR INFLUENCE FROM THE GREAT LAKES.  LATEST VISIBLE 
IMAGERY SHOWS AN AREA OF STRATOCUMULUS PUSHING INTO CNTRL OHIO 
ATTM.  LOOKING AT THE DTX (DETROIT) SOUNDING...THIS STRATOCUMULUS 
LAYER WAS BETWEEN 3K AND 5.5K FT...OR LOCATED IN AN UNSTABLE LAYER 
ABOVE A SFC INVERSION.  GIVEN THE FCST FLOW FROM 850 MB (ABOUT IN 
THE MIDDLE OF THIS LAYER)...STRATOCUMULUS WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT 
SOUTH AND PERHAPS A LITTLE SOUTHWEST.  SINCE THE CLOUD LAYER IS 
ABOVE A SFC INVERSION...AM NOT ANTICIPATING MUCH IN THE WAY OF MORE 
CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT.  HOWEVER...THE FLOW OFF LAKE ERIE AT 850 MB 
MAY KEEP SUPPLYING MSTR AND STRATOCUMULUS DEVELOPMENT FOR CNTRL 
OHIO.  ATTM...WILL LEAVE PARTLY SUNNY WORDING FOR WAPAKONETA AND 
DAYTON.  WILL GO MOSTLY CLOUDY CENTRAL OHIO.  KILN RADAR IS SHOWING 
WEAK DBZ RETURNS (8 TO 12 DBZ) OVER WEST CNTRL OHIO AND CNTRL OHIO.  
THIS MAY BE ENOUGH FOR A FLURRY...SO WILL MENTION A POSSIBLE FLURRY 
IN THE NORTH.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA...WILL LEAVE MOSTLY 
SUNNY...BUT WILL HAVE TO WATCH HOW FAST THE STRATOCUMULUS DECK MOVES 
TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST. 

KILN SOUNDING YIELDS 24 DEGREES IN FULL SUN TODAY.  WILL LOWER TEMPS 
ACRS DAYTON AND CNTRL OHIO GIVEN CLOUDS AND THE VALUE INDICATED AT 
ILN.  WILL SET UP A RANGE IN TEMPS FOR THE REMAINING SRN CWFA.

.ILN...NONE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE WILMINGTON OH
415 AM EST TUE JAN 1 2002

UPPER AIR PATTERN SHOWS PERSISTENT TROF ACROSS NORTHEASTERN 
NOAM...CONTINUING THE WESTERLY FLOW OVER OUR CWA. PIECE OF ENERGY 
DROPPING SOUTH ALONG THE WESTERN FLANK WILL DEVELOP INTO A CUTOFF 
LOW IN THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY 00Z WEDNESDAY...WITH THE ETA 
COMING IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS AVN RUNS.  WITH THE CUTOFF MOVING WELL 
SOUTH OF HERE...OUR AREA WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS WITH MOST ENERGY 
STAYING SOUTH WITH THE CUTOFF AND WITH THE MAIN NORTHERN VORTEX. 

SFC PATTERN HAS RIDGE ALONG THE OHIO VALLEY EXTENDING FROM A HIGH IN 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS.  RIDGE WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY STATIONARY OVER 
THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AS THE HIGH DROPS SOUTH BEHIND THE CUTOFF LOW. 

SATELLITE AND OBS SHOW CLEAR SKIES OVER OUR AREA...WITH LOW LEVEL 
CLOUDS OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS IN MINNESOTA.  SOME 
OF THOSE CLOUDS ARE HEADED DOWN INTO OUR AREA IN THE NORTH TO 
NORTHWEST FLOW THAT IS PRESENT FROM 925 MB ON UP.   

MODELS INDICATE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAKING IT INTO OUR NORTHERN 
COUNTIES TODAY BUT NOT ALL THE WAY TO CVG.  THEREFORE ILL GO WITH 
PARTLY SUNNY NORTH/MOSTLY SUNNY SOUTH.  LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL 
CONTINUE ITS SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT ACROSS OUR WHOLE AREA TONIGHT...SO 
PARTLY CLOUDY STILL LOOKS GOOD.  PERSISTENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A 
SLIGHT AMOUNT OF CAPE IS INDIDCATED FOR WEDNESDAY...SO MOSTLY CLOUDY 
WITH A CHANCE OF FLURRIES WILL STILL WORK.

FWC TEMPS LOOK A BIT WARM FOR TODAY SO ILL UNDERCUT BY A COUPLE 
DEGREES...BUT ILL STAY CLOSER TO THE FWC THAN TO THE MAV AS THE 
LATTER HAS BEEN MUCH TOO COLD LATELY.  REST OF FWC TEMPS LOOK CLOSE 
SO I WONT DEVIATE MUCH. 

.ILN...NONE.
