.UPDATE...

CIRRUS CLOUDS OUT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ARE
MOVING THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH THIS EVENING. THE CIRRUS HAS NOT
PREVENTED TEMPERATURES FROM DROPPING QUICKLY THIS EVENING. CURRENT
TEMPERATURES ARE AT OR ALREADY BELOW FORECASTED LOWS. MODELS ARE
SHOWING LOW CLOUDS DEVELOPING TO THE SOUTH LATER TONIGHT...MOVING
INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA BY THE EARLY MORNING HOURS.
CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW LOW CLOUDS DEVELOPING ALONG GULF
COAST SO EXPECT ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS BEFORE SPREADING NORTHWARD
INTO THE MIDSOUTH. WILL UPDATE TO LOWER FORECASTED LOWS INTO THE
LOW TO MID 30S AND TO UPDATE SKY CONDITIONS. UPDATE WILL BE OUT
SHORTLY.

BOTH THE GFS AND ETA SEEM TO HANDLE A WEAK SHORT WAVE TROF IN A SIMILAR
MANNER AS IT MOVES THRU THE AREA TOMORROW NIGHT. ISENTROPIC LIFT
AHEAD OF THE TROF SHOULD PRODUCE QUITE A BIT OF CLOUDINESS ALONG WITH A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN OVER THE AREA TOMORROW. AS THE TROF
MOVES THRU THERE WILL BE A POSSIBILITY OF A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. THE
MAIN THREAT OF STRONG STORMS SHOULD BE OVER THE EASTERN PART OF
THE FORECAST AREA HOWEVER.

GFS BRINGS ANOTHER SHORT WAVE THRU THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY PRODUCING
A FEW SHOWERS. OTHERWISE DRY CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL WITH MILD

DISCUSSION...
EARLY THIS MORNING SKIES WERE MOSTLY CLEAR. SOME AREAS OF FOG ARE 
AFFECTING MAINLY NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI WHERE HIGH SURFACE MOISTURE 
IS SLOW TO MOVE EAST. SOME MID/HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE MIDSOUTH OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS.

WEAK FLOW ALOFT TODAY WILL BRING UNEVENTFUL WEATHER TO THE FORECAST 
AREA. EXPECT A DRY...MILD DAY TODAY. A SHORTWAVE MOVING OVER THE 
DESERT SOUTHWEST TODAY WILL APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH OVERNIGHT.

THIS SHORTWAVE WILL BEGIN TO ADVECT IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BY LATE 
TONIGHT. EXPECT SOME LOW CLOUDS WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATING A 
SHALLOW LAYER OF SATURATION FROM THE SFC TO APPROXIMATELY 1KFT. 
LATEST MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THIS SHALLOW LAYER OF 
SATURATION WILL PERSIST THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY SUNDAY. PERHAPS SOME 
LIGHT DRIZZLE/FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE. UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPERATURES 
WILL ALSO BE EXPERIENCED SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

APPEARS THAT THE MAIN RAIN CHANCES WILL OCCUR DURING SUNDAY EVENING 
WHEN THE AREA IS UNDER THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 80KT JET 
STREAK. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS OVER MOST OF THE AREA. WILL 
HANG ON TO RAIN CHANCES THROUGH MONDAY AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES JUST 
NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. PERHAPS SOME SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY OVER 
THE NORTHEASTERN CWA...WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THE COLD CORE IN CLOSE 
PROXIMITY.

TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN TO NEAR NORMAL THURSDAY THROUGH 
THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. AFTER MONDAY...DRY CONDITIONS WILL 
PREVAIL.

.UPDATE...

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD FRONT HAS
PUSHED OUT OF THE CWA THIS EVENING. UPDATED EARLIER TO REMOVE
POPS. SKIES ARE CLEARING BEHIND THE FRONT ALLOWING FOR
TEMPERATURES TO DROP FURTHER THAN EXPECTED. TEMPERATURES IN JBR
HAVE ALREADY DROPPED CLOSE TO FORECASTED LOW. WILL UPDATE ACROSS
THE CWA TO LOWER LOWS AT LEAST A CATEGORY. PATCHY DENSE FOG HAS
DEVELOPED IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE FRONT WHERE THE WINDS ARE CALM
AND WHERE THE DRIER AIR HASN/T MOVED IN YET. HAVE ADDRESSED FOG
WITH A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT AS FOG IS NOT EXPECTED TO LAST LONG
AS DRIER AIR HAS ALREADY MOVED INTO MUCH OF EASTERN ARKANSAS.
UPDATE WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

&&

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 255 PM CST FRI DEC 30 2005) 

SYNOPSIS...
SURFACE COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME.  A 
RUMBLE OF THUNDER NEAR THE KY BORDER. OTHERWISE...LITTLE 
PRECIPITATION OCCURRING WITH THE COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE 
MIDSOUTH.

SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...
A MILD ZONAL PATTERN THROUGH THIS PERIOD.  SHORTWAVES MOVE THROUGH 
IN RAPID SUCCESSION...HOWEVER MOISTURE ACROSS OUR REGION IS 
MARGINAL. GOOD DOWNWARD MOTION OCCURS THIS EVENING BEHIND THE COLD 
FRONT SO LOW CLOUDS SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM.  WILL MENTION A  
THUNDERSTORM POSSIBILITY FOR THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
FOR THIS EVENING.  

NEXT SHORTWAVE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AND EARLY 
MONDAY.  AGAIN MOISTURE IS RELATIVELY STARVED UNTIL SYSTEM MOVES TO 
OUR EAST.  WILL CONTINUE THE MODEST CHANCE FOR RAINFALL LATE SUNDAY 
AND EARLY MONDAY.   

LONGER TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
ON TUESDAY STRONG SOUTHWEST FLOW AHEAD OF SHORTWAVE WILL PUSH 
TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL.  RELATIVELY DRY SURFACE MOISTURE AND 
DEGREE OF SOUTHWEST FLOW SHOULD COMBINE TO PUSH TEMPS NEAR OR ABOVE 
70 ACROSS ALL BUT NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE.  A DRY 
FRONTAL PASSAGE IS LIKELY SINCE MOISTURE IS LIGHT AND BEST LIFT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORTWAVE IS WELL NORTH.  FOR NOW WILL KEEP 
FORECAST DRY.  

HIGH CONFIDENCE IN PATTERN CHANGE WITH THE SHORTWAVE THAT MOVES 
THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY.  BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS SHOW A DEEPENING UPPER 
TROF THAT DEVELOPS ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF NORTH AMERICA.  ZONAL 
PATTERN TRANSITIONS TO NORTHWEST FLOW FOR DAYS 6 AND 7.  THIS WILL 
RESULT IN SIGNIFICANTLY COLDER TEMPERATURES. WILL TREND TOWARD 
SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL BOTH DAYS. POSSIBILITY OF FLURRIES OVER 
NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF FORECAST AREA...BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP DRY.

.DISCUSSION...
LOW CLOUDS STRETCHED ACROSS THE FAR NORTHEAST PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. MEANWHILE...MID LEVEL CLOUDS WERE MOVING 
INTO THE NORTHWESTERN PARTS OF THE FA. A COLD FRONT STRETCHED FROM 
SIOUX FALLS TO KANSAS CITY TO OKLAHOMA CITY TO CHILDRESS. LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE WAS ADVECTING NORTH ACROSS FAR EAST TEXAS AND CAN BE SEEN 
ON 11-3.9 MICRON SATELLITE IMAGERY...AS WELL AS SURFACE OBSERVATIONS.

THE UPPER LOW WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS IOWA TODAY. THIS WILL ALLOW THE 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER EAST TEXAS TO SHIFT EASTWARD BY THIS 
AFTERNOON. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD BE BISECTING CENTRAL ARKANSAS BY 
THIS AFTERNOON. THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD AND SOME 
SHOWERS SHOULD DEVELOP BY LATE AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY OVER THE 
WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THERE COULD BE SOME ISOLATED 
THUNDER GIVEN THE STEEP LAPSE RATES. THE BEST CHANCE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI WHERE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE WILL BE MORE PLENTIFUL.

RAINFALL SHOULD END FROM WEST TO EAST BEGINNING EARLY THIS EVENING. 
THE EASTERN FORECAST AREA SHOULD SEE RAIN MOVE INTO MIDDLE TN BY 
SUNRISE. 

ONCE THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA...THERE WILL BE A COUPLE DAYS 
OF LITTLE ACTIVITY. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO REMAIN ABOVE SEASONAL 
AVERAGES THROUGH MID WEEK. ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL OCCUR ON 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WITH THE NEXT SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING ACROSS 
THE SOUTH-CENTRAL U.S. ANOTHER FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE 
MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY.

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR BNA THIS EVENING. LOW PRESSURE
CENTERED NEAR FSD AND CDS...WITH FRONT BETWEEN THE TWO ACROSS THE
GREAT PLAINS. BACK EDGE OF CLOUDS HAS BEEN RATHER STUBBORN THIS
EVENING...AND HAS NOT MADE MUCH EASTWARD PROGRESS. CURRENTLY NEAR
A KENNETT TO SAVANNAH LINE. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD CLEAR THE AREA
THIS EVENING...IF ONE BELIEVES 925-850 MB RH PROGS. 

FORECAST PROBLEM OTHER THAN CLOUDS WILL BE LOW TEMPERATURES. A
FEW AREAS ALREADY BELOW FORECAST MINS...AND WILL NEED TO LOWER
THOSE ONE TO TWO CATEGORIES. WITH DEWPOINTS BETWEEN 30 AND
35...THAT LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD RANGE FOR LOWS FOR MOST OF THE
AREA. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF TEMPERATURES LEVEL OFF OR RISE
TOWARD MORNING AS FLOW BECOMES A LITTLE MORE SOUTHERLY.

TODAY AND TONIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE MID 
SOUTH. HOWEVER...SOME LOW LEVEL RESIDUAL MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER 
SUBSIDENCE INVERSION WITH CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT /PER SATELLITE IMAGERY 
AND 925-850 MB LAYER RH ANALYSIS/ SUGGESTS CLOUD COVER WILL BE SLOW 
TO CLEAR ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA PRIMARILY NORTH AND

SEE MUCH RECOVERY IN HIGH TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON WHERE CLOUD 
COVER WILL KEEP DAYTIME HEATING TO A MINIMUM. HIGHS WILL RANGE FROM

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF HIGH

.UPDATE...
SURFACE AND UPPER LOWS OVER OHIO AT 03Z. STILL SEEING SOME LOW
CLOUDINESS OVER ABOUT THE NORTHEAST THIRD OF THE CWA...ROUGHLY
NORTH OF A JONESBORO TO SAVANNAH LINE. NEW NAM 925-850 MB RH PROG HAS
A PRETTY GOOD FIT WITH 90 PERCENT RH WHERE CLOUDS ARE. THIS CHART
SHOWS CLOUDS SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THAT AREA TOWARD SUNRISE. WILL
PROBABLY NEED TO FINE-TUNE CLOUD WORDING THERE LATER THIS EVENING.

TEMPERATURES ARE MAINLY IN THE 40S...A COUPLE OF DEGREES LOWER
THAN HOURLY GRIDS...BUT FORECAST LOWS STILL LOOK WITHIN REACH.
WINDS HAVE DECOUPLED TO SOME EXTENT...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW GOOD
RADIATING CONDITIONS. 

WILL LIKELY DO AN UPDATE AROUND 05Z TO GET RID OF EVENING WORDING.

&&

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 300 PM CST WED DEC 28 2005) 

SYNOPSIS...
TIGHT CIRCULATION OVER THE OHIO VALLEY SLOWLY RETREATING NORTHEAST.  
TRAILING WEST EDGE OF LOW CLOUDS CREEPING TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER AND THE MO BOOTHEEL.  FAIRLY DECENT TEMPERATURE GRADIENT WITH 
UPPER 40S ACROSS THE KY/MO BORDER AND MIDDLE 60S IN EAST CENTRAL MS.
 

SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...
WHEN DO THE CLOUDS DISAPPEAR?  SATELLITE INDICATES CLOUDS RETREATING 
A BIT FASTER THAN MODELS INDICATE.  MOST AREAS SHOULD GO CLEAR EARLY 
THIS EVENING WITH LOCATIONS IN WEST TENNESSEE NEAREST THE TN RIVER 
CLEARING OUT AROUND MIDNIGHT.  ALTHOUGH THE SURFACE HIGH IS WEAK 
BELIEVE WE CAN DECOUPLE ENOUGH TO REACH NEAR FREEZING IN NORTHERN 
SECTIONS...SO HAVE DECIDED TO GO A BIT COOLER THAN GUIDANCE.  WITH 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION AND NO RETURN FLOW ON THURSDAY 
TEMPS SHOULD BE SLOW TO REBOUND.  HAVE KEPT TEMPS FAIRLY CLOSE TO 
CLIMATOLOGY IN THE NORTH AND A BIT WARMER THAN NORMAL IN THE SOUTH.
  

LONGER TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
ECMWF AND GFS IS GOOD AGREEMENT.  UPPER FLOW IS ZONAL AND FAIRLY 
FAST.  THIS DOESNT ALLOW MUCH TIME FOR GULF MOISTURE TO RETURN.  
FIRST SHORTWAVE AND SFC COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT.  LIKE 
LAST NIGHT...COLD FRONT MAY INDEED MOVE THROUGH DRY.  HAVE GONE A 
LOWER POP THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST.
  
ANOTHER SYSTEM IS EXPECTED LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.  THE GFS IS 
SUGGESTING SUFFICIENT MOISTURE RETURN FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION 
LATE SUNDAY AND MONDAY MORNING.  

A SHORTWAVE AND STRONGER COLD FRONT COULD ARRIVE LATE WEDNESDAY.  OF 
COURSE TIMING IS AN ISSUE...WHICH COULD OCCUR AFTER THE FORECAST 
PERIOD.  FOR NOW HAVE KEPT THE FORECAST DRY.  THIS SHORTWAVE COULD 
BE THE START OF A MORE MERIDIANAL FLOW PATTERN AS WE MOVE INTO THE 
SECOND WEEK OF JANUARY.

SATELLITE SHOWS LOW CLOUDS RACING INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND WEST 
TENNESSEE.  DONT SEE ANY TEMPERATURE RECOVERY AS DEEP UPPER LOW 
SPINS SLOWLY NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.  WITH COLD AIR 
ADVECTION CONTINUING THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON HAVE UPDATED

09Z SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES CENTER OF LOW PRESSURE JUST EAST OF 
SAINT LOUIS WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING ALONG THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE 
POTENTIAL TODAY AND FRIDAY.

TODAY AND TONIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH THIS 
MORNING. CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY FINALLY DEVELOPED A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO 
ACROSS AREAS TO THE NORTH OF JACKSON,TN. STEEP LAPSE RATES NEAR 
8C/KM...EXCELLENT WIND PROFILE WITH 45KT 850 MB JET AND 50KT 500MB

LACK OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...AND MINIMAL INSTABILITY (ONLY 500-800 
J/KG AND MARGINAL LI/S PER LAPS ANALYSIS) AT BEST HAS KEPT 
CONVECTION TO A MINIMUM. AS A RESULT WENT WITH CHANCE POPS ACROSS 
THE EASTERN FOURTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH 20 POPS BACK TO THE 
RIVER THIS MORNING...AND SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE POPS FOR THE AFTERNOON 
AS WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF LOW PRESSURE MAY PRODUCE 
A SHOWER.

TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD BACK IN 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WITH UPPER LEVEL RIDGING RETURNING. ANY 
RESIDUAL RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA 
SHOULD COME TO AN END BEFORE MIDNIGHT WITH CLOUD COVER DIMINISHING 
TOWARDS DAYBREAK THURSDAY.

.UPDATE...
SURFACE LOW OVER CENTRAL MISSOURI AT 03Z. DRYLINE SOUTHWARD FROM
LOW IS MOVING THROUGH THE LITTLE ROCK AREA AT THIS TIME. CURRENTLY
NO PRECIPITATION DEVELOPING ON DRYLINE. DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 50S
AHEAD OF THE LINE DROP INTO THE 30S BEHIND IT. WINDS OF 15 TO 25
MPH AHEAD OF THE FRONT.

SURFACE CAPES MAINLY IN THE 200-400 RANGE AHEAD OF DRYLINE WITH
LIFTED INDICES AROUND 0. GOOD BIT OF INHIBITION AHEAD OF
FRONT...AND RUC/NAM SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT BASES WOULD BE AROUND
825 MB...WITH A GOOD BIT OF CAPPING BELOW THAT. 

WEST EDGE OF CLOUDS LOOKS TO CLEAR THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AROUND
06Z...WITH NO PRECIPITATION BEHIND IT. WILL NEED TO START
UPDATING FORECAST TO HANDLE EVENING WORDING...AND TO LOWER POPS
FROM WEST TO EAST. SINCE TEMPERATURE DROP WILL BE LATE IN THE
NIGHT...CANNOT SEE REASON FOR ADJUSTING LOW TEMPS FOR NOW...JUST
TEMPERATURE TRENDS.

DISCUSSION...

CURRENTLY...LOW CLOUDS ARE RAPIDLY MIXING OUT ACRS THE MID SOUTH 
THIS AFTN. STRONG SSW SURFACE FLOW HAS DEVELOPED ACRS MOST OF THE 
AREA WITH GUSTS OF 25 TO 30 MPH. TEMPS HAVE RISEN INTO THE UPPER 60S 
ACRS SOUTHERN AREAS WHILE NRN AREAS HAVE JUST ABOUT BROKEN 60. SENT 
A QUICK UPDATE TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS. 

TONIGHT...SFC LOW PRESSURE OVER EXTREME SE KS WILL TRACK ACRS MO AND 
INTO SRN IL BY 12Z. A COLD FRONT WL MOVE INTO WRN SXNS OF THE CWFA 
AROUND MIDNIGHT AND SWEEP EAST...MOVING OUT OF THE MID SOUTH SHORTLY 
AFTER SUNRISE. SCT SHOWERS/TSTMS SHOULD DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT AS 
IT MOVES INTO THE MID SOUTH LATER TONIGHT. AVAILABLE MOISTURE IS A 
BIG QUESTION MARK WITH THIS SYSTEM. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN IS 
MARGINAL AT BEST WITH DEWPOINTS EXPECTED TO REACH THE MID 50S. 
MOISTURE IS ALSO NOT VERY DEEP WITH PRECIP H20 VALUES REMAINING BELOW 
1 INCH. DUE TO THE LACK OF DEEP MOISTURE HAVE OPTED TO CONTINUE WITH 
CHC POPS TONIGHT. SEVERE PARAMETERS LOOK MARGINAL AT BEST. WINDS 
ALOFT AND SHEAR ARE TYPICALLY STRONG BUT INSTABILITY SEEMS TO BE 
LACKING. MUCAPES FORECAST TO REMAIN LESS THAN 800 J/KG. UPDRAFTS WL 
HAVE A HARD TIME BEING SUSTAINED. NE MS WL BE THE MOST LIKELY AREA 
TO HAVE STRONG STORMS...BTWN 09Z-12Z...MAYBE SOME SMALL HAIL AND 
GUSTY WINDS. 

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...FRONT MOVES QUICKLY EAST INTO MIDDLE 
TN EARLY. MID SOUTH SHOULD BE SHROUDED BY LOW CLOUDS AND SOME LEFT 
OVER SHOWERS. TEMPS WL BE MUCH COOLER...THOUGH STILL A LITTLE WARMER 
THAN NORMAL. EXPECT LOW CLOUDS TO BE TENACIOUS...LIKE THIS LAST 
TIME...AND HANG ON ACRS MOST AREAS WED NIGHT. 

THURSDAY...SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA THOUGH LOW CLOUDS WL 
ONLY SLOWLY RETREAT. NOT MUCH TEMP ADVECTION EXPECTED SO TEMPS WL 
STILL REMAIN IN THE LOWER 50S. 

EXTENDED...LOOKS LIKE A SYSTEM EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS WITH RELATIVELY 
MILD TEMPS FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES FRI 
RESULTING IN WARMER TEMPS FRI AFTN FOLLOWED BY SHOWERS AND

TO AFFECT THE MID SOUTH ACROSS SOUTHWEST KANSAS AND WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY PLACING ASSOCIATED MID LEVEL TROUGH BACK ACROSS THE ROCKIES. 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW ON THE 
BACKSIDE OF HIGH PRESSURE HAS ALREADY BEGUN WITH MANY SPOTS ALREADY 
IN THE 40S. 

TODAY...WARM DAY EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS 13C 850 MB AIR 
UPSTREAM MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...PRODUCING 
HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE 60S TO AROUND 70 ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WINDS 
MAY BECOME GUSTY BY AFTERNOON AS A PORTION OF 35-40KT BOUNDARY LAYER 
WINDS MIX DOWN TO THE SURFACE...BUT THINK THAT WINDS WILL STAY BELOW 
ADVISORY CRITERIA AT THIS TIME. DAY SHIFT WILL MONITOR TRENDS THIS 
MORNING AND ADJUST WIND FORECAST IF NECESSARY. MOST AREAS WILL START 
THE DAY OFF MOSTLY SUNNY BUT WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY AS LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE INCREASES ACROSS THE REGION. 

TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...NGM/NAM/GFS IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH 
PROGRESSION OF NEXT SYSTEM. 700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES 
WILL STEEPEN TO AROUND 7C/KM AS UPPER LEVEL LOW CLOSES OFF IN THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE REFLECTION MOVES INTO THE 
MISSOURI VALLEY. 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS AROUND 10C...NEARLY

SURFACE WINDS...0-1KM STORM RELATIVE HELICITIES AT OR ABOVE 150 
M2/S2...AND 1000-1200 J/KG MOST UNSTABLE CAPE ACROSS NORTHERN 
MISSISSIPPI SUGGEST A SEVERE THREAT MAY EXIST ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. A FEW LIMITING FACTORS WITH 
THIS SYSTEM WILL BE MOISTURE AVAILABILITY...AND SURFACE BASED 
INSTABILITY. IF CONVECTION INITIATES /MAINLY ELEVATED/ IT SHOULD 
FORM INTO A LINE WITH SEVERE POTENTIAL REMAINING PRIMARILY ACROSS 
MISSISSIPPI. AT THIS TIME THE PRIMARY SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WOULD BE 
HAIL.

THE SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH DURING THE 
MORNING WITH ANY POST FRONTAL RAIN COMING TO AN END BY EARLY EVENING 
WITH LOWS DROPPING BACK INTO THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL RETURN ON THURSDAY AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING 
BUILDS BACK IN ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IN ADVANCE OF 
NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE AREA BY FRIDAY/SATURDAY.

RESULTING IN A MUCH WARMER THAN NORMAL DAY. INCREASING HIGH 
CLOUDINESS WL KEEP TEMPS FROM GETTING OUT OF CONTROL TOUGH LOWER

WRAP AROUND SHOWERS AND LOW CLOUDS WED AFTN INTO WED NIGHT. THE BIG 
QUESTION IS THE SEVERE POTENTIAL ASSOCD WITH THIS SYSTEM. AS USUAL 
WITH THIS TIME OF YEAR THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH SHEAR. INSTABILITY

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 405 AM CST MON DEC 26 2005) 

DISCUSSION...

THE H5 LOW THAT BROUGHT DAMP CONDITIONS TO THE MID-SOUTH OVER THE
CHRISTMAS WEEKEND IS MOVING AWAY AND LOCATED OVER THE MID-ATLANTIC
STATES THIS MORNING. SATELLITE SHOWS LOW CLOUDS CONTINUING TO MOVE
ACROSS THE MO BOOTHEEL INTO WEST TN AND A SMALL PART OF NORTH MS.
NAM 925 MB RELATIVE HUMIDITY FORECASTS INDICATE THESE CLOUDS WILL
GRADUALLY LIFT NORTHEASTWARD THIS MORNING LEAVING SUNNY SKIES
ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL EXTEND
FROM THE PLAINS TO THE MID-SOUTH TODAY. MEANWHILE...SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY MOVE TO OUR EAST ALLOWING WINDS TO TURN TO
THE SOUTHWEST WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES.

THIS WARMING TREND WILL CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY. 850 MB PROGS
SHOW 12C TEMPERATURES SPREADING INTO THE MID-SOUTH. HIGHS WILL BE
MOSTLY IN THE 60S. HOWEVER...INCREASING SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL
CAUSE CLOUDS TO SPREAD INTO THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE
REGION..ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL. THESE CLOUDS
WILL KEEP HIGH TEMPERATURES FROM REACHING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM IS STILL ON TRACK BY THE MODELS TO AFFECT
THE MID-SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHER PLAINS
TUESDAY...THEN MOVE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY. THE SURFACE FRONT IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO EASTERN AR
TOWARD SUNRISE WEDNESDAY. THINK THEIR IS ENOUGH OF A CHANCE OF
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH THIS SYSTEM TO MENTION IN THE HAZARDOUS
WEATHER OUTLOOK FOR THE ENTIRE AREA...ALTHOUGH JUST A CHANCE AT
THIS POINT. THE NAM / GFS TRACK THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE JUST TO
OUR NORTH WITH THE NAM INDICATING THE UPPER TROUGH BECOMING MORE
NEGATIVELY TILTED WITH INCREASING UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE.
SOUTHWEST WINDS AT 925 MB ARE FORECAST TO INCREASE TO 50 KNOTS
TUESDAY NIGHT. SURFACE DEWPOINTS ARE FORECAST TO CLIMB INTO THE
50S ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. CAPES ARE FORECAST BETWEEN 1000 AND
1500 J/KG FROM ABOUT THE TN / MS BORDER SOUTHWARD. MEANWHILE...0-3
KM HELICITY VALUES CLIMB TO BETWEEN 100 AND 150 M2/S2 ACROSS NORTH
MS. MUCH OF THIS WOULD PUT THE EMPHASIS FOR SEVERE WEATHER FROM
ABOUT THE TN / MS SOUTHWARD FROM EAST-CENTRAL AR INTO NORTH MS.
HOWEVER...CAN NOT RULE OUT THE THREAT OF SEVERE FURTHER NORTH
CLOSER TO THE UPPER LOW DUE TO COLD AIR ALOFT.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

405 AM CST MON DEC 26 2005

.DISCUSSION...

THE H5 LOW THAT BROUGHT DAMP CONDITIONS TO THE MID-SOUTH OVER THE
CHRISTMAS WEEKEND IS MOVING AWAY AND LOCATED OVER THE MID-ATLANTIC
STATES THIS MORNING. SATELLITE SHOWS LOW CLOUDS CONTINUING TO MOVE
ACROSS THE MO BOOTHEEL INTO WEST TN AND A SMALL PART OF NORTH MS.
NAM 925 MB RELATIVE HUMIDITY FORECASTS INDICATE THESE CLOUDS WILL
GRADUALLY LIFT NORTHEASTWARD THIS MORNING LEAVING SUNNY SKIES
ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL EXTEND
FROM THE PLAINS TO THE MID-SOUTH TODAY. MEANWHILE...SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY MOVE TO OUR EAST ALLOWING WINDS TO TURN TO
THE SOUTHWEST WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES.

THIS WARMING TREND WILL CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY. 850 MB PROGS
SHOW 12C TEMPERATURES SPREADING INTO THE MID-SOUTH. HIGHS WILL BE
MOSTLY IN THE 60S. HOWEVER...INCREASING SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL
CAUSE CLOUDS TO SPREAD INTO THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE
REGION..ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL. THESE CLOUDS
WILL KEEP HIGH TEMPERATURES FROM REACHING THEIR FULL POTENTIAL.

THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM IS STILL ON TRACK BY THE MODELS TO AFFECT
THE MID-SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHER PLAINS
TUESDAY...THEN MOVE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY. THE SURFACE FRONT IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO EASTERN AR
TOWARD SUNRISE WEDNESDAY. THINK THEIR IS ENOUGH OF A CHANCE OF
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH THIS SYSTEM TO MENTION IN THE HAZARDOUS
WEATHER OUTLOOK FOR THE ENTIRE AREA...ALTHOUGH JUST A CHANCE AT
THIS POINT. THE NAM / GFS TRACK THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE JUST TO
OUR NORTH WITH THE NAM INDICATING THE UPPER TROUGH BECOMING MORE
NEGATIVELY TILTED WITH INCREASING UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE.
SOUTHWEST WINDS AT 925 MB ARE FORECAST TO INCREASE TO 50 KNOTS
TUESDAY NIGHT. SURFACE DEWPOINTS ARE FORECAST TO CLIMB INTO THE
50S ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. CAPES ARE FORECAST BETWEEN 1000 AND
1500 J/KG FROM ABOUT THE TN / MS BORDER SOUTHWARD. MEANWHILE...0-3
KM HELICITY VALUES CLIMB TO BETWEEN 100 AND 150 M2/S2 ACROSS NORTH
MS. MUCH OF THIS WOULD PUT THE EMPHASIS FOR SEVERE WEATHER FROM
ABOUT THE TN / MS SOUTHWARD FROM EAST-CENTRAL AR INTO NORTH MS.
HOWEVER...CAN NOT RULE OUT THE THREAT OF SEVERE FURTHER NORTH
CLOSER TO THE UPPER LOW DUE TO COLD AIR ALOFT.

THERE ARE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH THE
GFS DIGGING THE UPPER LOW STRONGER ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH AND THE
NAM MOVING IT TO OUR EAST FASTER AND WEAKER. AT THIS POINT WILL
CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA FROM THE WEST
THURSDAY WITH DRY WEATHER RETURNING. ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH FRIDAY
NIGHT. THE LATEST GFS IS STRONGER WITH THIS SYSTEM THAN EARLIER
RUNS. WILL UP THE POPS A LITTLE. DRY WEATHER WILL RETURN BY
SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND CONTINUE INTO NEW YEARS DAY WITH NO REALLY
COLD AIR IN SIGHT THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK.

SATELLITE TRENDS SHOW LOW CLOUDS GRADUALLY PULLING AWAY FROM THE
REGION. THIS IS SUPPORTED REASONABLY WELL BY 00Z ETA. CURRENT
FORECAST SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE. ONCE THE LOW CLOUDS CLEAR
AND WINDS LIGHTEN...AREAS OF FOG ARE POSSIBLE AS RESIDUAL BOUNDARY

DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE PUSHING EAST TONIGHT. BACK 
EDGE OF CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW IS CURRENTLY RUNNING FROM 
EXTREME EASTERN OKLAHOMA INTO SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS. DRIZZLE ALSO 
REMAINS AROUND THE AREA FROM THE UPPER LOW. EXPECT DRIZZLE THAT MAY 
BE MIXED WITH A FLURRY TO LINGER ACROSS NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF THE 
MIDSOUTH DURING THE EVENING HOURS ENDING BY MIDNIGHT. THE BACK EDGE 
OF THE CLOUDS WILL SLOWLY CREEP INTO THE CWA TONIGHT AND BY MORNING 
EXPECT THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH TO BE MOSTLY CLEAR. TEMPERATURES WILL 
HOLD STEADY DURING THE EVENING HOURS UNTIL THE SKIES CLEAR THEN  
TEMPERATURES SHOULD PLUMMET INTO THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S FOR 
LOWS. SOME FOG MAY ALSO DEVELOP AS THE SKIES CLEAR ESPECIALLY IN THE 
WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH FOR MONDAY. TEMPERATURES 
WILL REBOUND FROM TODAY AND WILL BE BACK INTO THE UPPER 40S TO MID 
50S FOR HIGHS. THE HIGH WILL SHIFT EAST BY MONDAY NIGHT AND WILL 
ALLOW FOR WELL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES TO OCCUR ON TUESDAY AS 
SOUTHWEST WINDS KICK INTO GEAR. TUESDAY WILL FEEL LIKE A HEAT WAVE 
WITH HIGHS IN THE 60S POSSIBLY REACHING CLOSE TO 70 DEGREES IN 
SOUTHERN AREAS OF THE CWA.

A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION TUESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. EXPECT SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH 
POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM TO DEVELOP TUESDAY EVENING ALONG A WARM 
FRONT THAT WILL BE LOCATED ALONG NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA. 
BETTER CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR WITH A SFC 
LOW AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA WEDNESDAY. 
SOME THUNDERSTORMS THAT OCCUR WEDNESDAY MAINLY ACROSS EAST CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI COULD BE SEVERE BUT IT WILL END UP 
DEPENDING ON THE EXACT TRACK OF THE SFC LOW. STILL TOO EARLY TO 
REALLY TELL. WILL CONTINUE MENTION IN HWO WITH STRONG THUNDERSTORMS 
POSSIBLE ACROSS THIS AREA. AN UPPER LOW WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE COLD 
FRONT WEDNESDAY NIGHT CONTINUING THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
AREA. CLOUDS FROM THE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY WITH COOLER 
TEMPERATURES BACK INTO THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S FOR HIGHS.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY REBUILD INTO THE AREA BY THURSDAY NIGHT. 
THE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE EAST BY FRIDAY BEFORE ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
MOVES THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THE FRONT WILL 
NOT HAVE A LOT OF MOISTURE WITH IT SO THE FRONT MAY COME THROUGH 
DRY. WILL CONTINUE SMALL POPS FOR NOW.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REBUILD INTO THE AREA FOR NEW YEARS GIVING THE 
MIDSOUTH DRY CONDITIONS WITH NEAR HIGHS IN THE 50S.

A CLOSED H5 LOW OF 5410 METERS IS CENTERED OVER NORTHWEST TN THIS
MORNING. SATELLITE SHOWS LOW CLOUDS COVERING THE MID-SOUTH THIS
MORNING AND RADARS INDICATE RAIN WRAPPING AROUND THE H5 LOW ACROSS
PARTS OF THE AREA. BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN TOO WARM
FOR ANY SNOW IN OUR FORECAST AREA.

MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT THE H5 LOW WILL PUSH TOWARD THE OHIO
RIVER VALLEY TODAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY POPS FOR MOST OF THE
AREA TODAY AS WRAP AROUND PRECIPITATION CONTINUES MAINLY THIS
MORNING. LATER FORECASTS WILL PROBABLY BE ABLE TO LOWER POPS FOR THIS
AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.
WILL MENTION CHANCE OF LIGHT SNOW IN ADDITION TO THE RAIN FOR
EXTREME NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...WITH THE BEST CHANCE ACROSS THE
HIGHER TERRAIN OF RANDOLPH AND LAWRENCE COUNTIES. NO ACCUMULATION
OF ANY SNOW IS EXPECTED IN THESE LOCATIONS AS TEMPERATURES REMAIN
ABOVE FREEZING. ELSEWHERE...LOOKING AT FORECAST CRITICAL LOW LEVEL
THICKNESS VALUES AND MODEL SOUNDINGS...BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPERATURES
APPEAR TOO WARM FOR BUT A REMOTE CHANCE OF SNOW AND WILL LEAVE OUT
OF THE FORECAST. COLDER AIR WILL GRADUALLY BE SPREADING INTO THE
MID-SOUTH TODAY BUT ABOUT THE TIME THE LOWER LEVELS GET COLD
ENOUGH FOR SNOW...THE CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL HAVE ENDED OR THE
LEVELS AT MINUS 10C FOR ICE NUCLEATION WILL HAVE DRIED OUT LEAVING
BUT A CHANCE FOR DRIZZLE.

FORECAST RELATIVE HUMIDITY PROGS HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT IN SHOWING LOW
CLOUDS CLEARING FROM THE WEST TONIGHT. THINK WINDS WILL STAY UP
ENOUGH TO PREVENT WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG...BUT THIS WILL HAVE TO BE
WATCHED IN CASE WINDS DECREASE MORE THAN EXPECTED. THE H5 LOW WILL
LOSE INFLUENCE OVER MID-SOUTH WEATHER TONIGHT WITH H5 HEIGHTS
INCREASING ACROSS THE AREA.

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE WARMER AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING
EXTENDS FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE MID-SOUTH. A SURFACE HIGH WILL
MOVE EAST OF OUR AREA ALLOWING WINDS TO TURN TO THE SOUTHWEST.
FORECAST 850 MB CHARTS SHOW GOOD WARM AIR ADVECTION.

ON TUESDAY...THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE MOVES OVER THE MID-SOUTH AND
850 MB TEMPERATURES CLIMB TO BETWEEN 12C AND 14C. HOWEVER...THERE
IS A GOOD INFLUX OF MOISTURE AND ADVECTION OF HIGHER SURFACE
DEWPOINTS. THIS LEADS TO LOW CLOUDS SPREADING INTO THE AREA FROM
THE SOUTHWEST DURING THE AFTERNOON AS SHOWN BY THE NAM 925 MB
RELATIVE HUMIDITY FORECASTS. WILL FORECAST HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S
AND LOWER 60S TUESDAY...BUT THEY COULD BE HIGHER IF THE CLOUDS
FAIL TO MATERIALIZE.

A POTENT UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL
APPROACH THE MID-SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT AND MOVE ACROSS THE AREA
WEDNESDAY. FAVOR THE FASTER GFS / ECMWF FORECAST THAN THE SLOWER
NAM AS THE GFS DID BETTER WITH THE CURRENT SYSTEM. THERE COULD BE
SOME STRONG THUNDERSTORMS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTH MS AS SHOWN BY
SPC IN THE EXTENDED OUTLOOK. THE GFS SHOWS LIFTED INDICES AROUND MINUS
TWO WITH GOOD UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH WHICH WILL BE IN A DEEPENING STAGE. THIS IS REALLY TOO FAR
OUT AT THIS TIME TO PIN DOWN IF ANY THREAT OF SEVERE WILL EXTEND
AS FAR NORTH AS OUR FORECAST AREA.

CLOUDS HAVE ALREADY SPREAD OVER THE AREA DURING THE NIGHT...AND
RAIN IS QUICKLY MOVING IN FROM THE WEST. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH HAS
ALREADY CLOSED OFF OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. A STRONG 300 MB JET OF
140 KNOTS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THIS TROUGH WILL CAUSE IT TO
CONTINUE TO DIG SOUTHWARD TODAY. BY 00Z THIS EVENING...THE CLOSED
LOW AT 500 MB IS FORECAST TO BE OVER NORTHERN AR / SOUTHERN MO
WITH THE GFS AND NAM SIMILAR AND THE GFS JUST SLIGHTLY STRONGER
WITH A CENTER HEIGHT OF 542 M. AN ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONT
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH FROM THE WEST TODAY AND THIS
EVENING. GOOD UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE AHEAD OF THE UPPER TROUGH
ALONG WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THE SURFACE FRONT WILL LEAD TO
GOOD UPWARD MOTION...AND HIGH CHANCES OF SHOWERS TODAY. WILL ADD
ISOLATED THUNDER FROM EAST-CENTRAL AR...ACROSS NORTH MS...INTO
WEST TN FOR TODAY. STABILITY VALUES ARE MARGINAL AT BEST...BUT
LIGHTNING DETECTION HAS BEEN INDICATING SOME LIGHTNING STRIKES
ACROSS SOUTHERN AR EARLY THIS MORNING DUE TO ELEVATED INSTABILITY.

FOR TONIGHT AND CHRISTMAS...WILL CONTINUE WITH HIGH POPS. THE CLOSED 
UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL MOVE DIRECTLY OVER THE MID-SOUTH
TONIGHT...AND THEN GRADUALLY MOVE TO OUR EAST SUNDAY. LOOKING AT
CRITICAL 1000 TO 950 MB THICKNESS VALUES...1000 TO 850 MB
THICKNESS VALUES...AND MODEL SOUNDING DATA...THE CHANCE FOR SNOW 
APPEARS MARGINAL WITH THE BEST CHANCE PROBABLY ACROSS NORTHEAST AR
/ MO BOOTHEEL AND PARTICULARLY THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF RANDOLPH AND
LAWRENCE COUNTIES OF AR. BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPERATURES APPEAR
MARGINAL FOR SNOW BUT THE POSSIBILITY DOES EXIST FOR SOME SNOW.
WILL MENTION THE CHANCE OF SNOW (ALONG WITH RAIN) FOR NORTHEAST
AR / MO BOOTHEEL AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AS COLDER AIR PUSHES
IN...THEN ACROSS ALL OF THE MID-SOUTH CHRISTMAS. TEMPERATURES WILL
BE WELL ABOVE FREEZING...SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW.

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY WITH A
RETURN TO MOSTLY SUNNY AND DRY WEATHER. ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH WEDNESDAY CAUSING A CHANCE
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY FOR
WEDNESDAY...BUT THESE PROBABLY WILL NEED TO BE INCREASED FURTHER
IN LATER FORECASTS. DRY WEATHER WILL RETURN THURSDAY AS AN UPPER
LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE AREA...CONTINUING THE QUICK WEST TO
EAST MOVEMENT OF WEATHER SYSTEMS ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH.

REGIONAL RADAR SHOWS LEADING EDGE OF RAIN BEGINNING TO MOVE OUT OF
OKLAHOMA. LATEST RUN OF THE NAM IS CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS RUN.
THIS BRINGS RAIN INTO AREAS ALONG AND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER A COUPLE HOURS BEFORE MORNING. OBSERVATIONS ARE SHOWING THAT
TEMPS ARE BEGINNING TO LEVEL OFF. ONLY ADJUSTMENTS TO TONIGHTS
FORECAST ARE DUE TO WORDING. DID UPDATE FORECAST FOR EARLY TOMORROW
MORNING WITH LATEST MODEL RUN SHOWING THAT RAIN WILL LIKELY BE
LINGERING ACROSS EASTERN ARKANSAS FOR A FEW HOURS.

DISCUSSION...

A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH LATE 
TONIGHT. MODELS HAVE COME INTO AGREEMENT WITH DEVELOPING A CUT OFF 
UPPER LOW OVER MISSOURI ALONG WITH AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT LATE 
TONIGHT. EXPECT INCREASING CLOUDS DURING THE EVENING HOURS WITH RAIN 
BEGINNING ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA AROUND MIDNIGHT. THE 
AREA OF RAIN WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH ON SATURDAY 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT. EXPECT THE MAJORITY OF THE RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE FRONT TO EXIT THE MIDSOUTH BY SATURDAY EVENING. THE UPPER LOW 
WILL SKIRT ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT 
INTO SUNDAY MORNING. EXPECT A BAND OF WRAP AROUND PRECIP BEHIND THE LOW. 
THE LOW LEVELS ARE STILL FAIRLY WARM SO EXPECT PRECIP TO REMAIN 
MAINLY RAIN AT THIS TIME BUT A CAN/T RULE OUT A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW 
OR RAIN MIXING WITH SNOW AT TIMES. WILL ADD MENTION OF RAIN OR SNOW IN 
FORECAST. EVEN WITH A MENTION OF SNOW THE MIDSOUTH SHOULD NOT EXPECT 
A WHITE CHRISTMAS. NO ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED. CHRISTMAS WILL BE 
COLD WITH CLOUDY SKIES WITH POSSIBLE FLURRIES. EXPECT HIGHS IN THE 
LOWER TO MID 40S.

SKIES WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR CHRISTMAS NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO 
BUILD INTO THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL QUICKLY WARM UP AS THE HIGH 
SHIFTS EAST BY MONDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN TO THE UPPER 
50S BY TUESDAY FOR HIGHS FOR MOST LOCATIONS. 

ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP TUESDAY NIGHT IN WHAT LOOKS 
TO BE AN EXACT REPEAT OF THIS WEEKEND/S SYSTEM. AN AREA OF RAIN WILL 
DEVELOP AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT AND WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WILL BE FOLLOWED BY AN UPPER LEVEL LOW WEDNESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. EXPECT WRAP AROUND RAIN ON WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. COOLER WEATHER WILL MOVE BACK INTO THE AREA WITH THE SYSTEM 
ON WEDNESDAY.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE BACK INTO THE CWA ON THURSDAY AND WILL 
DOMINATE THE WEATHER THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

DISCUSSION...

TODAY PROMISES TO BE A VERY NICE DAY WEATHERWISE FOR LAST MINUTE
CHRISTMAS SHOPPING. H5 HEIGHTS WILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS
TIME OF THE YEAR ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH WITH A WESTERLY FLOW.
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES COAST WILL
CAUSE A WARMING SOUTHWEST WIND FLOW ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH. THERE
MAY BE SOME CIRRUS...BUT THOSE PESKY LOW CLOUDS FROM YESTERDAY ARE
GONE. HIGHS TODAY WILL CLIMB INTO THE UPPER 50S.

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL DIG INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS
TONIGHT...AND EVENTUALLY A CLOSED LOW WILL FORM. AN ASSOCIATED
SURFACE COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO APPROACH THE MID-SOUTH FROM THE
WEST TONIGHT. THE GFS AND NAM INDICATE FAIRLY GOOD UPPER LEVEL
DYNAMICS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE AREA BY LATE TONIGHT WITH GOOD
UPWARD MOTION. MOISTURE IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED AS 850 MB WINDS REMAIN
MOSTLY WESTERLY WITHOUT A GOOD INFLOW FROM THE GULF.
NEVERTHELESS...WILL EXPAND THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS ALL OF THE
AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND INCREASE THE POPS A LITTLE FOR TONIGHT.

ON CHRISTMAS EVE...THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH.
WILL INCREASE POPS FOR MOST OF THE AREA...WITH THE BEST CHANCE
FROM THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF WEST TN INTO NORTHEAST MS WHERE THE
UPWARD MOTION BECOMES THE GREATEST DURING THE DAY. ATTM...STABILITY
VALUES APPEAR TOO LOW FOR ANY THUNDERSTORMS...BUT WILL MONITOR
LATER MODELS. THERE MAY BE SOME TEMPORARY DRY SLOTTING WITH PARTIAL
CLEARING BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...BEFORE CLOUDS AND COOLER AIR
MOVE IN. HOWEVER...AT THIS TIME...WILL CONTINUE MOSTLY CLOUDY
SKIES FOR THE AVERAGE SKY COVER SATURDAY. THE CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW
WILL MOVE TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA SATURDAY INTO EARLY SUNDAY. THE
GFS IS FURTHER SOUTH AND STRONGER WITH THE LOW THAN THE NAM. WILL
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE MODELS AT THIS TIME. WILL CONTINUE WITH A
30 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS SATURDAY NIGHT. CAN NOT RULE OUT THE
RAIN MIXING WITH OR CHANGING TO SOME LIGHT SNOW...BUT LOOKING AT
THE MODEL SOUNDINGS THE BOUNDARY LAYER APPEARS MARGINAL FOR ANY
SNOW. WILL LEAVE OUT ANY MENTION OF SNOW FOR THE TIME BEING.

RELATIVE HUMIDITY PROGS SHOW LOW CLOUDS COVERING THE MID-SOUTH
CHRISTMAS DAY WITH A COLD NORTHWEST WIND. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL
GRADUALLY MOVE TO OUR EAST.

MONDAY AND TUESDAY...A RATHER STRONG RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE
FORECAST AREA FROM THE WEST BRINGING DRY AND WARMER WEATHER. AN UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH WEDNESDAY
BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. NO REALLY COLD AIR IS SEEN IN THE
IMMEDIATE FUTURE THOUGH.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES 
TONIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SOUTHWEST WINDS TO KICK UP OVER THE 
CWA. THE LINGERING LOW CLOUDS FROM TODAY SHOULD FINALLY DISSIPATE BY 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON ALLOWING FOR MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. EXPECT 
TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S FOR THE MOST 
PART.

THE SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL ALLOW FOR WARMER CONDITIONS ON FRIDAY. 
SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S. CLOUDS WILL 
BEGIN TO INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 
MODELS DIFFER ON PLACEMENT OF THE SFC LOW AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 
CUT OFF UPPER LOW. THE GFS ALONG WITH UKMET AND ECMWF SHOWS A SFC 
LOW TRACKING ACROSS MISSOURI INTO KENTUCKY LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY NIGHT. THE MODELS ALSO SHOW A CUT OFF UPPER LOW DEVELOPING 
BEHIND THE SFC LOW. THE LATEST RUN OF THE NAM SHOWS NO CUT OFF UPPER 
LOW AND HAS THE SFC LOW MUCH FURTHER NORTH ALONG THE GREAT LAKES. IN 
FACT IT HAS WEAKENED THE ASSOCIATED SHORTWAVE FROM PREVIOUS RUN AND 
IS NOW NOT PRODUCING A LOT OF PRECIP WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE ON 
SATURDAY. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE GFS/UKMET/ECMWF SOLUTION. EXPECT 
FRONT TO BE THROUGH THE ENTIRE CWA BY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. COLD AIR 
WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE SYSTEM. CHRISTMAS DAY WILL BE 
A COLD DAY WITH CLOUDY SKIES WITH MAYBE A FLURRY OCCURRING ACROSS 
PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH FOR MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR/PARTLY CLOUDY 
BY MONDAY BUT TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE ON THE COOL SIDE. TUESDAY WILL 
BE A LITTLE WARMER AS THE HIGH SHIFTS EAST.

ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP ON WEDNESDAY NEAR THE 
AR-LA-TEX REGION. EXPECT SYSTEM TO SPREAD RAIN INTO THE CWA THROUGH 
THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AS THE SYSTEM MOVES EASTWARD.

DISCUSSION...

HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING. A PESKY
AREA OF LOW CLOUDS STILL LINGERS IN SPOTS NEAR THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER EARLY THIS MORNING...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ELSEWHERE.
EXPECT LOW CLOUDS TO DISSIPATE BEFORE SUNRISE...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR
CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR THE MORNING RUSH HOUR. TEMPERATURES AT 09Z
RANGE FROM THE LOWER 20S IN EASTERN AREAS...WHERE CLEAR SKIES AND
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS EXIST...TO THE LOWER AND MID
30S IN THE DELTA REGION...WHERE LOW CLOUDS ARE HANGING ON.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD SETTLE IN NEAR 20 DEGREES EAST TO NEAR 30
IN THE DELTA REGION BY SUNRISE.

VERY PLEASANT WEATHER IS EXPECTED OVER THE AREA TODAY AND FRIDAY AS
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES SLOWLY SOUTHEAST AND THE UPPER LEVEL
FLOW BECOMES PREDOMINANTLY ZONAL. WEAK LOW LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION
ALONG WITH FULL SUN THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO
WARM 10 TO 12 DEGREES ABOVE YESTERDAYS HIGHS...WITH MAXES EXPECTED
IN THE 50S. EVEN STRONGER WARM AIR ADVECTION SHOULD CONTINUE INTO
FRIDAY...WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF
YEAR. 850 MB TEMPERATURES ARE FORECAST TO CLIMB TO +8C EAST TO
+11C WEST...AND TEMPERATURES ON FRIDAY SHOULD TOP OUT IN THE UPPER
50S NORTH TO LOWER 60S SOUTH...WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE.
THIS DRY AND WARM EARLY WINTER WEATHER WILL COME TO AN END OVER
THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND THOUGH AS THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS
THE AREA.

BY FRIDAY NIGHT...A 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO DROP
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES AND AMPLIFY. THIS SHOULD HELP
SEND A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE MID-SOUTH ON SATURDAY. CURRENTLY THE
MODELS ARE HANDLING THE DEGREE OF AMPLIFICATION OF THE TROUGH
DIFFERENTLY AS WELL AS THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD OF THE
SYSTEM. THE 00/06Z NAM RUNS ARE SHOWING LESS AMPLIFICATION WITH
THE TROUGH AND MUCH LESS MOISTURE RETURN. ON THE FLIP SIDE...THE
00Z RUNS OF THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE MUCH DEEPER WITH THIS UPPER
TROUGH AND IN FACT CUT OFF A 500 MB UPPER LOW OVER THE MIDDLE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...WHICH MOVES BY TO THE NORTH OF OUR AREA
THROUGH SUNDAY. IN ADDITION...THESE MODELS BRING IN A HIGHER
DEGREE OF MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM. THEY INDICATE MORE SIGNIFICANT
MOISTURE IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT AND THEN OCCLUDE THE FRONT AND
CONTINUE DEEPER MOISTURE WITH THE FRONTAL OCCLUSION AND UPPER LOW
ON SUNDAY. SINCE THERE IS STILL QUITE A BIT OF DISSAGREEMENT AMONG
THE VARIOUS COMPUTER MODELS AND ALSO SINCE THE NEW RUNS OF THE GFS
AND ECMWF ARE STRONGER AND FURTHER SOUTH WITH UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM
AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAYS RUNS...PREFER TO KEEP THE FORECAST
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAYS THINKING UNTIL BETTER MODEL CONTINUITY IS
ESTABLISHED. WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST FOR AFTER MIDNIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT AND
CONTINUED WITH LOW END CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY
NIGHT. MOST PRECIPITATION SHOULD TAPER OFF BY SUNDAY MORNING...WITH
PLENTY OF LOW CLOUDS LINGERING THROUGH CHRISTMAS DAY. THESE CLOUDS
ALONG WITH LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES MUCH
COOLER. HIGHS TEMPERATURES CHRISTMAS DAY SHOULD STRUGGLE TO GET
INTO THE 40S...AND MAY NEED TO BE LOWERED FURTHER IN UPCOMING
FORECASTS. CANNOT EVEN TOTALLY RULE OUT A FEW CHRISTMAS DAY
FLURRIES...BUT THINK THAT THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE FOR
PRECIPIATION GENERATION WILL HAVE MOVED EAST BY THEN. 

ONCE THIS SYSTEM PULLS TO OUR EAST LATE SUNDAY...DRY SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN UNDER NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. ANOTHER MORE SIGNIFICANT
SHORTWAVE WILL ATTEMPT TO APPROACH THE REGION BY THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK...BUT THERE REMAINS SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES AMONG THE
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS...SO HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THIS PART OF THE
FORECAST DRY FOR NOW WITH NEAR SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES.

SYSTEM. THE 00/06Z NAM RUNS ARE SHOWING LESS AMPLIFICATION WITH
THE TROUGH AND MUCH LESS MOISTURE RETURN. ON THE FLIP SIDE...THE
00Z RUNS OF THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE MUCH DEEPER WITH THIS UPPER
TROUGH AND IN FACT CUT OFF A 500 MB UPPER LOW OVER THE MIDDLE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...WHICH MOVES BY TO THE NORTH OF OUR AREA
THROUGH SUNDAY. IN ADDITION...THESE MODELS BRING IN A HIGHER
DEGREE OF MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM. THEY INDICATE MORE SIGNIFICANT
MOISTURE IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT AND THEN OCCLUDE THE FRONT AND
CONTINUE DEEPER MOISTURE WITH THE FRONTAL OCCLUSION AND UPPER LOW
ON SUNDAY. SINCE THERE IS STILL QUITE A BIT OF DISSAGREEMENT AMONG
THE VARIOUS COMPUTER MODELS AND ALSO SINCE THE NEW RUNS OF THE GFS
AND ECMWF ARE STRONGER AND FURTHER SOUTH WITH UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM
AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAYS RUNS...PREFER TO KEEP THE FORECAST
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAYS THINKING UNTIL BETTER MODEL CONTINUITY IS
ESTABLISHED. WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST FOR AFTER MIDNIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT AND
CONTINUED WITH LOW END CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY
NIGHT. MOST PRECIPITATION SHOULD TAPER OFF BY SUNDAY MORNING...WITH
PLENTY OF LOW CLOUDS LINGERING THROUGH CHRISTMAS DAY. THESE CLOUDS
ALONG WITH LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES MUCH
COOLER. HIGHS TEMPERATURES CHRISTMAS DAY SHOULD STRUGGLE TO GET
INTO THE 40S...AND MAY NEED TO BE LOWERED FURTHER IN UPCOMING
FORECASTS. CANNOT EVEN TOTALLY RULE OUT A FEW CHRISTMAS DAY
FLURRIES...BUT THINK THAT THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE FOR
PRECIPIATION GENERATION WILL HAVE MOVED EAST BY THEN. 

ONCE THIS SYSTEM PULLS TO OUR EAST LATE SUNDAY...DRY SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN UNDER NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. ANOTHER MORE SIGNIFICANT
SHORTWAVE WILL ATTEMPT TO APPROACH THE REGION BY THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK...BUT THERE REMAINS SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES AMONG THE
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS...SO HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THIS PART OF THE
FORECAST DRY FOR NOW WITH NEAR SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH REMAINS STRETCHED OVER THE MID-
SOUTH THIS MORNING. LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES AN
EXPANSIVE AREA OF LOW CLOUDS OVER THE REGION AND THIS IS IN
ASSOCIATION WITH INCREASED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BETWEEN 3KFT AND 6KFT.
EXPECT THESE LOWER LEVEL CLOUDS TO REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS MOST OF
THE AREA TODAY. THE ONLY EXCEPTIONS WILL BE ACROSS FAR NORTHEAST
AND SOUTHEAST SECTIONS...WHERE THE MOISTURE LAYER REMAINS MORE
SHALLOW AND MAY MIX OUT ENOUGH TO PRODUCE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.
ELSEWHERE...DEEPER MOISTURE LAYER SHOULD REMAIN TRAPPED AS AN 850 MB
THERMAL TROUGH AXIS LINGERS OVER THE AREA ALONG WITH WARM AIR
ADVECTION IN THE MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...ABOVE THE LOW
LEVEL THERMAL TROUGH. THIS SHOULD STRENGTHEN A LOW LEVEL INVERSION
AND THEREFORE KEEP THE MOISTURE TRAPPED BELOW. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD
IMPACT AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURES...SO HAVE DECIDED TO GO SEVERAL
DEGREES COOLER THAN CURRENT MOS GUIDANCE.

THE 850 MB THERMAL TROUGH APPEARS TO LINGER ACROSS THE AREA INTO
TONIGHT...BEFORE LIFTING OUT TO THE EAST LATE TONIGHT. THEREFORE...
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES SHOULD CONTINUE AREAWIDE THROUGH AT LEAST
MIDNIGHT...WITH SOME SLOW CLEARING FROM THE NORTH AFTER MIDNIGHT.
STILL AREAS ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40 SHOULD REMAIN IN THE
CLOUDS UNTIL THURSDAY MORNING. THIS WILL ALSO HAVE AN IMPACT ON
TONIGHTS OVERNIGHT LOWS. HAVE GONE NEAR MOS GUIDANCE ACROSS
NORTHERN AREAS...WHERE CLOUDS SHOULD CLEAR AFTER MIDNIGHT AND SOME
RADIATIONAL COOLING MAY OCCUR. ELSEWHERE...HAVE GONE ABOVE MOS
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES...WHERE CLOUDS WILL INSOLATE AND KEEP
TEMPERATURES FROM BOTTOMING OUT.

FOR THE END OF THE WEEK...THE LOW LEVEL THERMAL TROUGH WILL LIFT
OUT TO THE EAST AND ALLOW FOR SHORTWAVE RIDGING ALOFT. IN
ADDITION...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS AND THEN 
SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA...SETTING UP LOW LEVEL RETURN SOUTHERLY
FLOW. THIS COMBINED WITH APPRECIABLE WARM AIR ADVECTION ALOFT
SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO REBOUND QUITE NICELY TO ABOVE AVERAGE
LEVELS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY
CLOUDY SKIES.

ANOTHER 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FOR
THE WEEKEND. AT THIS POINT...THE MODELS ARE INDICATING THE MID
LEVEL TROUGH HANGING BACK BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. IN ADDITION...MOISTURE
RETURN DOES NOT APPEAR TOO IMPRESSIVE AT THIS POINT. SO FOR NOW WILL
JUST KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT...AND LOW
END CHANCE POPS IN FOR SATURDAY WITH THE FRONT AND SATURDAY NIGHT
IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE LINGERING MID LEVEL TROUGH AXIS.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE NEAR NORMAL ON SATURDAY...BUT RETURN TO
BELOW AVERAGE FOR CHRISTMAS DAY...WITH DECENT COLD ADVECTION AND
LINGERING LOW CLOUD COVER. TEMPERATURES ACTUALLY MAY BE COOLER ON
SUNDAY THEN THE CURRENT FORECAST SHOWS...BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE
CONTINUED MODEL TRENDS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. BUT HAVE CONTINUED
TO TREND COOLER FOR CHRISTMAS DAY. THIS COLD SHOT APPEARS TO BE
SHORT-LIVED THOUGH WITH WARMER AND DRY WEATHER RETURNING FOR THE
BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK.

FOR A MORE SOUTHERLY WIND AND WARMER TEMPERATURES. DRY CONDITIONS 
WILL PREVAIL THROUGH FRIDAY.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE REGION OVER THE WEEKEND. 
WARM AIR ADVECTION AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL PROVIDE A CHANCE OF RAIN 
LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING. A SFC LOW MAY 
DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT WHICH WOULD ENHANCE THE CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION AND LINGER IT FARTHER INTO CHRISTMAS. GFS MODEL ALSO 
SUGGESTS THAT THE PRECIPITATION MAY END AS FLURRIES CHRISTMAS

.DISCUSSION...

COLD SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS
MORNING HAS ALLOWED FOR CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS. THIS HAS
PROVIDED FOR EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS OVER THE
AREA AND AS A RESULT TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED INTO THE LOWER
TEENS IN NORTHEAST SECTIONS TO THE LOW 20S SOUTHWEST AREAS. THESE
VERY COLD TEMPERATURES SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH SUNRISE THEN SLOWLY
BEGIN TO RISE.

A 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH...CURRENTLY POSITIONED FROM THE MIDDLE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE AREA TODAY. LATEST EARLY
MORNING SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF LOW CLOUDS JUST TO
THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA AND IN ADVANCE OF THE UPPER LEVEL
SHORTWAVE TROUGH. EXPECT LOWER AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS TO SLOWLY
INCREASE ACROSS THE WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THROUGH THE DAY.
THIS WILL BE A SLOW PROCESS THOUGH...AS THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE
ATMOSPHERE REMAIN VERY DRY. WITH THIS IN MIND HAVE INCREASED
CLOUDS TO MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR THE WESTERN HALF OF THE REGION BY THIS
AFTERNOON...WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ELSEWHERE. NO PRECIPITATION
IS EXPECTED TODAY...AS THE LOW LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE REMAIN TOO
DRY TO SUPPORT ANY. IN ADDITION...THE BEST LIFT AND MOISTURE
SHOULD REMAIN TO OUR SOUTHWEST TODAY. ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS ONLY
INDICATES VERY WEAK UPGLIDE AND RATHER HIGH CONDENSATION PRESSURE
DEFICITS OVER OUR AREA...WHICH IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO PRODUCING MUCH
PRECIPITATION. IN OTHER WORDS...NOT MUCH LIFT AND STILL A TOO
DRY. AS FOR TEMPERATURES...NOT EXPECTING MUCH OF A REBOUND OVER
YESTERDAYS HIGHS...AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES REMAIN IN THE -2C SOUTH
TO -6C NORTH...WITH MINIMAL TEMPERATURE ADVECTION. SO TEMPERATURES
FROM THE MID 30S NORTH TO LOW 40S SOUTH CAN BE EXPECTED.

THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH SHOULD SWING ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. 
THIS SHOULD BRING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AREAWIDE. CANNOT COMPLETELY
RULE OUT A FEW FLURRIES TONIGHT ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF
THE FORECAST AREA. ALTHOUGH STILL RATHER DRY ATMOSPHERE SHOULD
LIMIT THIS TO VERY ISOLATED AREAS...IF AT ALL. NOT EXPECTING ANY
PROBLEMS...EVEN IF A FEW FLURRIES FALL. CHANCE OF THIS OCCURRING
STILL QUITE LOW...SO WILL LEAVE ALL MENTION OF FLURRIES OUT OF THE
FORECAST AT THIS POINT. BETTER CHANCES OF FLURRIES WILL REMAIN
SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA TOWARDS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI.

THIS SHORTWAVE TROUGH SHOULD BEGIN TO LIFT OUT OF THE AREA ON
WEDNESDAY. ENOUGH MOISTURE MAY LINGER ACROSS THE AREA ALONG WITH A
LINGERING 850 MB THERMAL TROUGH AND POSSIBLY ENOUGH CAPPING ALOFT
TO LOCK LOW CLOUDS INTO THE AREA FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DAY
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON TEMPERATURES...EVEN AS WARM
ADVECTION ALOFT PICKS UP ON WEDNESDAY. EXPECT ANOTHER COOL
DAY...WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 40S ACROSS THE AREA. CLOUDS SHOULD
BEGIN TO BREAK BY LATER WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AS THE THERMAL TROUGH
PULLS EAST.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA THROUGH MID-WEEK
BEFORE MOVING SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. UPPER
LEVEL RIDGING WILL ALSO BUILD IN FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. THIS
MEANS DRY WEATHER WITH A NOTICABLE WARMING TREND FOR THURSDAY AND
FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REBOUND TO ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS FOR
THIS TIME PERIOD. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS INDICATING ANOTHER SHORTWAVE
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FRIDAY NIGHT...HELPING
TO BREAK DOWN THE UPPER RIDGE. THIS SYSTEM SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE
AREA ON SATURDAY AND DEPART TO THE EAST SATURDAY NIGHT. HAVE KEPT
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS WITH THIS SYSTEM. THE
00Z/20 RUNS OF THE ECMWF AND GFS INCREASINGLY STRONGER AND DEEPER WITH
THIS UPPER SYSTEM AS COMPARED WITH PAST RUNS. SINCE THIS IS THE
FIRST INDICATIONS OF A STRONGER SYSTEM...PREFER TO ONLY TREND POPS
UP SLOWLY. HAVE ALSO LOWERED TEMPERATURES A BIT FOR CHRISTMAS DAY
BEHIND THE FRONT. MODELS SUGGEST COLDER CONDITIONS POSSIBLE FOR
CHRISTMAS DAY...BUT WILL NOT ADJUST TEMPS TOO SIGNIFICANTLY UNTIL
MODELS SHOW AN IMPROVED DAY TO DAY TREND. WILL HAVE A BETTER
HANDLE ON THIS SYSTEM AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE WEEKEND. DRY WEATHER
WILL ONCE AGAIN RETURN BEHIND THIS SYSTEM WITH NEAR OR SLIGHTLY
BELOW SEASONAL TEMPERATURES.

HIGH PRESSURE WL SETTLE DIRECTLY OVER THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT
RESULTING IN LIGHT WINDS AND GOOD COOLING CONDITIONS. SOME HIGH
CLOUDINESS MAY ARRIVE LATE BUT THAT SHOULD NOT PREVENT SOME VERY
COLD TEMPS BY TUE MORNING. EASTERN SXNS WL FALL INTO THE UPPER
TEENS WHILE EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD SEE AT LEAST THE LOWER AND MID
20S. HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE AREA ON TUE AND WITH LITTLE
IN THE WAY OF TEMP ADVECTION EXPECT ANOTHER COLD DAY WITH HIGHS IN
THE LOWER 40S...ABOUT 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. MID AND HIGH CLOUDS
WL INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE DAY...ESPECIALLY ACRS SRN SXNS AS A
500 MB TROF SWINGS INTO THE AREA LATE TUE. THIS FEATURE WL MOVE
EAST OF THE REGION BY LATE TUE NIGHT AND SHOULD PRODUCE JUST

COLD AIR SURGING INTO THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING AS CANADIAN HIGH
PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE MID SOUTH. TEMPS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE 20S
AT MOST PLACES WITH A NORTHERLY BREEZE. SKIES WERE MOSTLY CLEAR
WITH SCT-BKN CLOUDS ALONG THE TN/KY AND AR/MO BORDERS. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE MS VALLEY BY LATER TODAY. LOW
LEVEL CAA WL CONT THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITH 850 MB TEMPS FALLING
INTO THE -4C TO -6C RANGE. EXPECT SOME CLOUDINESS ALONG THE NRN
TIER THIS MORNING OTRW PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACRS THE AREA...WITH
MORE SUN ACRS NRN MS. TEMPS WL STRUGGLE TODAY. TEMPS WL ONLY REACH
THE MID AND UPPER 30S ACRS NRN SXNS...ABOUT 40 IN MEM AND LOWER TO
MID 40S ACRS NRN MS.

HIGH PRESSURE WL SETTLE DIRECTLY OVER THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT
RESULTING IN LIGHT WINDS AND GOOD COOLING CONDITIONS. SOME HIGH
CLOUDINESS MAY ARRIVE LATE BUT THAT SHOULD NOT PREVENT SOME VERY
COLD TEMPS BY TUE MORNING. EASTERN SXNS WL FALL INTO THE UPPER
TEENS WHILE EVERYONE ELSE SHOULD SEE AT LEAST THE LOWER AND MID
20S. HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE AREA ON TUE AND WITH LITTLE
IN THE WAY OF TEMP ADVECTION EXPECT ANOTHER COLD DAY WITH HIGHS IN
THE LOWER 40S...ABOUT 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. MID AND HIGH CLOUDS
WL INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE DAY...ESPECIALLY ACRS SRN SXNS AS A
500 MB TROF SWINGS INTO THE AREA LATE TUE. THIS FEATURE WL MOVE
EAST OF THE REGION BY LATE TUE NIGHT AND SHOULD PRODUCE JUST
CLOUDINESS..MAINLY ACRS NRN MS.

HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE AREA ON WED AS TEMPS SLOWLY START
TO MODERATE UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. BY THU AND FRI THE HIGH
SLIPS TO THE EAST ALLOWING A WARMER SOUTHERLY FLOW TO DEVELOP.
TEMPS WL CLIMB TO NORMAL LEVELS OR SLIGHTY ABOVE BY THU AND BE
DOWNRIGHT WARM...MID AND UPPER 50S...BY FRI. 00Z GFS AND 00Z ECMWF
CONT TO INDICATE THAT A TROF WL MOVE THROUGH DURING THE FRI

ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM WILL MOVE JUST SOUTH OF THE REGION AROUND
MIDWEEK. MOISTURE LOOKS VERY LIMITED SO NO PRECIP CHANCES WITH
THIS SYSTEM EITHER. UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL TOWARDS THE END

COOL HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING.
SKIES HAVE CLEARED OUT OVER MUCH THE MID SOUTH OVERNIGHT WITH MOST
OF THE CLOUD COVER NORTHWEST OF THE AREA ACROSS NW AR...OK AND MO.
WINDS WERE LIGHT NORTHERLY AND TEMPS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE LOWER
30S.

GIVEN RECENT SAT TRENDS EXPECT CLOUDS TO FILL IN ACRS THE NRN TIER
TODAY. EXPECT MORE SUNSHINE AS YOU HEAD SOUTH INTO NORTHERN MS.
SUNSHINE WL HELP TEMPS CLIMB A COUPLE DEGREES HIGHER THAN
SATURDAY...EXCEPT EXTREME NE AR WHERE CLOUDS MAY HINDER TEMPS
MORE. 

A 1040 MB CANADIAN HIGH SURGES SOUTH TONIGHT BRINGING A REINFORCING
SHOT OF COLD AIR. ALSO...EXPECT ADDITIONAL CLOUDINESS TO SPREAD
INTO THE AREA WITH THE FRONT. BY 12Z MON 850 TEMPS WL BE AROUND
-8C ALONG THE KY/TN BORDER. STRONG LOW LEVEL CAA WL CONTINUE THRU
THE DAY RESULTING IN HIGH TEMPS ONLY IN THE UPPER 30S NORTH TO
MID 40S ACRS SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS IS ABOUT
10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. HIGH PRESSURE WL BE CENTERED OVER THE MID
SOUTH BY TUE MORNING. SHOULD BE A VERY COLD NIGHT THOUGH THERE MAY
BE SOME HIGH CLOUDINESS MOVING IN LATE. EXPECT LOWS FROM THE UPPER
TEENS EAST TO MID 20S SOUTHWEST.

NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES ON TUE AND MID AND HIGH CLOUDS WL PROBABLY
INCREASE THROUGH THE DAY...ESPECIALLY WEST OF THE RIVER. TEMPS WL
ONCE AGAIN BE WELL BELOW NORMAL. THE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO WEAKEN
AS IT MOVES INTO THE AREA AND WL PROBABLY BE JUST AN AREA OF MID
CLOUDS WITH A FEW SPRINKLES/FLURRIES BY THE TIME IT GETS HERE.
TEMPS WL BE TRICKY TUE NIGHT SINCE IT WL DEPEND LARGELY ON AMOUNT
OF CLOUD COVER...MID 20S TO LOW 30S SEEMS FINE FOR NOW.

WED THROUGH FRI...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES...SLIDING SE OF THE AREA
BY THU AND FRI. AS SURFACE WINDS SHIFTS TO THE S/SW EXPECT A
WARMING TREND BY THE END OF THE WEEK WITH TEMPS SLIGHTLY ABOVE
NORMAL BY FRIDAY. GFS INDICATING THAT A TROF WL MOVE THROUGH ON
SAT WITH A CHANCE FOR PRECIP. 00Z ECMWF INDICATES MOISTURE NOT
VERY IMPRESSIVE SO WL LEAVE OUT MENTION OF PRECIP FOR NOW.

SATELLITE SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF TRANSPARENT CIRRUS MOVING THROUGH
THE REGION WITH MUCH DENSER MID TO HIGH CLOUDS OVER TEXAS. LATEST MODELS
CONTINUE TO SUGGEST THAT THE REGION WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY
UNDER THIS DECK OF MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS. NO MAJOR CHANGES MADE
TO THE FORECAST. SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO TRACK ALONG
THE GULF COAST WITH THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE REMAINING SOUTH OF
THE FORECAST AREA. RAIN SHIELD MIGHT GET AS FAR NORTH AS AROUND
TUPELO SATURDAY NIGHT. NORTHERN STREAM SYSTEM STAYS WELL NORTH OF
THE AREA SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WITH ANY PRECIPITATION FALLING ACROSS
CENTRAL MISSOURI. ALTHOUGH THERE COULD BE SOME PERIODS OF SUN ON
SATURDAY...FEEL THAT MOST OF THE TIME WILL REMAIN MAINLY CLOUDY.
NAM SHOWS STRATUS HANGING AROUND THE AREA ON SUNDAY AS THE
SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM MOVES AWAY FROM THE AREA. THIS MAY HINDER
HIGH TEMPS ON SUNDAY. A CLIPPER SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH
MONDAY. MODELS HAVE BACKED OFF CONSIDERABLY IN TERMS OF QPF...IN
FACT THEY ARE NOW DRY. WILL CONTINUE DRY FORECAST THROUGH NEXT
WEEK ALTHOUGH MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A BIG COOL DOWN FOR MONDAY.
SO MUCH THAT TEMPS MAY STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF THE 30S ON MONDAY.
GFS SHOWS AN UPPER LOW DEVELOPING IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AROUND
MIDWEEK...BUT TRACKING WELL SOUTH OF THE REGION AND SHOULD NOT
IMPACT THE MID SOUTH AS IT MOVES ALONG THE GULF COAST TOWARDS END
WEEK. CHRISTMAS EVE FORECAST IS DRY WITH BIG BLUE H IN CONTROL.
850 TEMPS WARMING TO AROUND +6 SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO TEMPERATURES
CLIMBING A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

CURRENTLY...COOL HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD ACROSS THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THIS MORNING. TEMPS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE UPPER
20S AND LOWER 30S AS WINDS SLOWLY DIMINISH. SKIES WERE CLEAR
ACROSS THE REGION.

COOL HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE REGION TODAY AND
DRIFT EAST ON SATURDAY. EXPECT HIGH TEMPS IN THE MID AND UPPER
40S THIS AFTERNOON...A COUPLE DEGREES BELOW NORMAL...AND ONLY
SLIGHTLY WARMER ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON. MID AND HIGH CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE
INCREASE BY THIS AFTERNOON INTO SATURDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM.

ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT EXPECT SURFACE LOW TO MOVE ALONG
THE GULF COAST. THIS TIME SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE WILL REMAIN
SUPPRESSED TO THE SOUTH WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN ACROSS
EXTREME SOUTH PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM WILL
PASS TO THE NORTH OF THE REGION.

REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR MOVES INTO THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY AND
ESPECIALLY SUNDAY NIGHT AS A STRONG 1040 MB HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM
BUILDS INTO THE REGION. MONDAY WILL BE VERY COLD WITH HIGH TEMPS
IN THE 30S AND LOWER 40S...ABOUT 8-12 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. TEMPS
WL DROP INTO THE TEENS IN MANY LOCATION TUE MORNING AS HIGH
PRESSURE MOVES DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA.

EXTENDED...COOL WEATHER CONTS THROUGH THU AS COOL HIGH PRESSURE
REMAINS OVER THE REGION. PERHAPS BY FRI WL COULD SEE A WARMING
TREND AS MEAN TROF SHIFTS EAST AND SOUTHERLY FLOW MAY RETURN.

SATELLITE SHOWS COLD AIR CU OVER MISSOURI TRYING TO WORK SOUTHWARD
INTO THE REGION. MUCH OF THIS CLOUDINESS IS BEING DIURNALLY
DRIVEN SO EXPECT THAT SKIES TONIGHT WILL REMAIN MAINLY CLEAR OVER
MUCH OF THE REGION. PERHAPS EXTREME NORTHERN AREAS OF FORECAST
AREA MAY SEE SOME CLOUDS. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN UP TONIGHT SO
GUIDANCE SHOULD BE REASONABLE FOR LOWS. MODELS SHOWING A GOOD DEAL
OF MID LEVEL MOISTURE MOVING INTO THE REGION FROM THE SOUTHWEST
DURING THE DAY TOMORROW. EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE
DAY. CLOUD COVER WILL STICK AROUND THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE WEEKEND
AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES ALONG THE GULF COAST. MODELS
CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE WILL REMAIN
SOUTH OF THE REGION. THERE IS A SECONDARY BATCH OF PRECIPITATION
ASSOCIATED WITH NORTHERN STREAM ENERGY BUT THAT SHOULD MOVE ACROSS
MISSOURI.

THIS MORNINGS RUN OF THE GFS SHOWS AN UPPER VORT TRAVERSING ACROSS
SOUTHERN MISSOURI ON MONDAY WHICH COULD LIGHT RAIN OR LIGHT SNOW
ACROSS NORTHERN HALF OF THE REGION. PREVIOUS RUNS DID NOT SUPPORT
THIS. ALTHOUGH LATEST RUN OF THE EUROPEAN DOES SUGGEST IT. HAVE
LEFT CHANCES OUT FOR NOW UNTIL THERE IS SOME RUN TO RUN
CONSISTENCY. MODELS SHOW A QUICK HITTING SHOT OF COLD AIR BEHIND
THIS SYSTEM. BUT TEMPERATURES SHOULD RECOVER RELATIVELY QUICKLY AS
THE UPPER TROUGH LIFTS AWAY FROM THE REGION.

SURFACE LOW LOCATED NEAR MERIDIAN MISSISSIPPI EARLY THIS MORNING
WITH COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH OF THE LOW TO JUST EAST OF NEW
ORLEANS. SOME LIGHT RAIN CONTINUES TO FALL OVER EASTERN PARTS OF THE
FORECAST AREA BUT IS GRADUALLY DIMINISHING. THE MAIN AREA THAT MIGHT
SEE RAIN THIS MORNING WOULD BE EXTREME SOUTHEAST PORTION OF FORECAST
AREA AND 20 POPS SHOULD COVER THAT AREA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL
GRADUALLY BUILD INTO THE REGION TONIGHT AND FRIDAY WHICH WILL KEEP
THINGS DRY FOR A FEW DAYS. A DISTURBANCE WILL TRACK ALONG THE GULF
COAST SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH
KEEPING MOST OF THE MOISTURE SOUTH OF THE REGION AND WILL KEEP 20
POPS CONFINED TO SOUTHERN PART OF FORECAST AREA. HIGH PRESSURE
SHOULD CONTINUE TO CONTROL WEATHER OVER REGION FROM SUNDAY THROUGH
WEDNESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES STAYING AT OR BELOW NORMAL LEVELS FOR
MUCH OF NEXT WEEK. ANOTHER DISTURBANCE WILL TRACK ACROSS THE GULF
COAST TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY BUT WE SHOULD BE TOO DRY FOR ANY

RAIN CONTINUES TO FALL ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. MODERATE RAIN WAS FALLING ACROSS MOST OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 
WHILE LIGHTER RAIN WAS OCCURRING ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE. THE RAINFALL 
SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH MUCH OF THE NIGHT ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI. EXPECT RAINFALL AMOUNTS OVERNIGHT TO APPROACH ONE 
INCH...PERHAPS SLIGHTLY HIGHER BY SUNRISE. 

TEMPERATURES LOOK IN GOOD SHAPE AS THE EDGE OF THE RAIN SHOULD MOVE 
INTO AREAS ALONG THE MS RIVER JUST BEFORE MORNING. DRY AIR MOVING IN 
SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO DIP TO FORECAST LOWS.

THE ONLY THING THAT HAS BEEN UPDATED HAS BEEN THE QPF OVERNIGHT. 
HAVE ADJUSTED UPWARDS BY AT LEAST A TENTH IN MOST PLACES. NO OTHER 
CHANGES PLANNED AT THIS TIME.

RAIN WILL SPREAD BACK ACROSS MUCH OF THE MID-SOUTH THE REMAINDER
OF THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...OTHERWISE THE FORECAST IS MOSTLY A
DRY ONE FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE EASTWARD FROM TX TONIGHT. AN
ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE FROM EASTERN TX TO AL BY 12Z
THURSDAY AND DEEPEN. THE RESULT WILL BE RAIN SPREADING ACROSS
MAINLY THE SOUTHEAST TWO-THIRDS OF THE MID-SOUTH. THERE WILL BE A
TIGHT GRADIENT OF POPS TONIGHT RANGING FROM 100 PERCENT AT TUP TO
30 PERCENT AT JBR. RADARS ALREADY INDICATE WIDESPREAD RAIN
STRETCHING FROM NORTH MS TO EAST TX. A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH
THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH OVERNIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY FROM THE WEST.
CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE FROM THE WEST AFTER MIDNIGHT.

THERE MAY BE SOME LINGERING RAIN EARLY THURSDAY FROM THE SOUTHEAST
CORNER OF WEST TN INTO NORTHEAST MS. OTHERWISE COOLER AND DRY HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST THROUGH
FRIDAY...THEN MOVE EASTWARD SATURDAY. THE NAM...GFS...AND ECMWF
INDICATE A WEAK SURFACE LOW TRACKING WELL TO OUR SOUTH SATURDAY
NIGHT THROUGH THE NORTHERN GULF. WILL LEAVE IN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
LIGHT RAIN FOR PART OF NORTH MS FOR THIS TIME.

STRONG HIGH PRESSURE WILL STRETCH FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO THE
MID-SOUTH EARLY NEXT WEEK. AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL APPROACH
THE AREA FROM THE NORTH MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY CAUSING SOME
CLOUDS...BUT ATTM THE LOWER LEVELS APPEAR TOO LOW FOR ANY PRECIPITATION.

HOWEVER...THE THREAT OF RAIN IS NOT OVER FOR THIS AFTERNOON. A

LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER TX WILL MOVE EAST WITH AN ASSOCIATED SURFACE
LOW OVER THE NORTHWEST GULF MOVING INTO LA BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON.

COLD FRONTAL EXTENDS FROM EASTERN SOUTH DAKOTA THROUGH CENTRAL KANSAS
INTO NORTHWEST TEXAS AND CONTINUES TO MOVE SLOWLY EAST. EXTENSIVE
AREA OF LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS CAN BE FOUND ACROSS MAINLY THE WESTERN
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA OF RAIN SHOULD GRADUALLY MOVE

EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER SO HAVE LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS
THERE WITH CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS WEST OF THE RIVER. BY 00Z TONIGHT
THE COLD FRONT BE MOVING ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER SO WHILE MOST
OF THE RAIN WILL BE AHEAD OF THE FRONT...THERE MAY STILL BE A FEW
SHOWERS BEHIND THE FRONT SO HAVE KEPT LOW POPS ACROSS EAST ARKANSAS.
COLD FRONT SHOULD BE JUST EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY
MORNING SO SOME RAIN LINGERING IN OUR EXTREME SOUTHEAST COUNTIES NOT
OUT OF THE QUESTION SO HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN. AIR BEHIND THIS
COLD FRONT IS DRIER BUT NOT THAT MUCH COLDER SO WILL SEE LITTLE
CHANGE IN HIGHS FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY BUT OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE
A LITTLE COLDER. THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM WILL APPROACHING THE REGION
ON SATURDAY. 00Z MODEL RUNS ARE SLOWER WITH THIS SYSTEM SO HAVE
REMOVED POPS FOR SATURDAY. MODELS ALSO KEEPING MOST OF THE MOISTURE

.UPDATE...

REGIONAL RADAR SHOWS THAT RAIN HAS DEVELOPED AS FORECAST ACROSS 
EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND WESTERN ARKANSAS. THE SHIELD OF RAIN WILL
CONTINUE TO PROGRESS TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH...FOLLOWING THE BEST
ISENTROPIC LIFT. RAIN SHOULD BE SPREADING ACROSS THE MS RIVER
AROUND 09-12Z. THE CURRENT FORECAST HANDLES THIS WELL. DID MAKE
SOME CHANGES TO THE POP CONFIGURATION FOR TOMORROW. MODELS IN GOOD
AGREEMENT THAT PRECIP WILL BE GONE WEST OF THE RIVER BY 18Z.
REDUCED POPS IN THESE AREAS TO CHANCE CATEGORY FOR THE AFTERNOON
HOURS AND THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT WILL LIKELY BE ABLE TO TRIM THIS BACK
FURTHER.

TEMPERATURES IN NE SECTIONS OF THE CWA HAVE DIPPED BEYOND THE
FORECAST LOWS. ADJUSTED GRIDS TO SHOW THIS DEVELOPMENT BUT FEEL
THERE WILL NOT BE MUCH MORE OF A DROP DUE TO CLOUDY SKIES AND
INCREASING WARM AIR ADVECTION. 

REST OF THE FORECAST PARAMETERS ON TRACK. UPDATED ZONES WILL BE OUT

THE IMPORTANT WEATHER NEWS FOR THE MIDSOUTH AT THIS TIME IS THAT
ITS FIXIN TO RAIN. REGIONAL WEATHER ANALYSIS NOW HAS A FRONT IN
SE CO AND SW KS THAT IS GOING TO MOVE THROUGH HERE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. INCREASING CLOUDINESS AND WINDS ARE EXPECTED AS THE FRONT
DRAWS NEAR FROM THE WEST. RAIN WILL BE THE MAIN COURSE ON THE
WEATHER MENU...AND IT COULD START BEFORE MIDNIGHT WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD THE REST OF OUR AREA
BEFORE DAYBREAK WEDNESDAY. RAIN IS EXPECTED OFF AND ON THROUGH
THE DAY TOMORROW. THEN...THE FRONT WILL BE IN AL/MIDDLE TN BY
THURSDAY MORNING...AND RAIN WILL TAPER OFF FROM THE WEST
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

THE NEXT WEATHER EVENT FOR US WILL BE THIS COMING WEEKEND WHEN A
LOW FORMS IN THE GULF. WE WILL BE ON THE NORTHERN EXTREME OF
MOISTURE THAT RIDES UP OVER THE HIGH THAT WILL BE POSITIONED IN
THIS AREA. BECAUSE PCPN COMES SATURDAY AND STAYS MAINLY IN THE
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE MIDSOUTH...LIGHT RAIN IS THE MOST LIKELY

QUIET WEATHER CURRENTLY OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH CLEAR SKIES AND
LIGHT WINDS TEMPERATURES HAVE FALLEN INTO THE MID 20S TO MID 30S.
HIGH PRESSURE WILL WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EAST WHICH WILL KEEP WINDS IN
MORE OF AN EASTERLY DIRECTION THIS AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION...CLOUDS

AFTERNOON. AS A RESULT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD NOT BE NEARLY AS WARM AS
THEY WERE MONDAY. STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE RAPIDLY OUT OF THE ROCKIES
THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO NORTHWEST MISSOURI BY WEDNESDAY MORNING.
THIS SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO SPREAD RAIN INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT
MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT SO HAVE ADJUSTED POPS SOME FOR TONIGHT. BEST
CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE ON WEDNESDAY AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. AIR BEHIND THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE MORE
PACIFIC IN ORIGIN THAN ARCTIC SO IT SHOULDNT BE MUCH COOLER FOR
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. FORECAST GETS MORE COMPLICATED AS THE WEEKEND
APPROACHES. MODELS TRY TO BRING SOME SHORTWAVE ENERGY SATURDAY INTO
SUNDAY. IT APPEARS THAT WE WILL SEE SOME PRECIPITATION STARTING
SOMETIME SATURDAY AND CONTINUING INTO SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.
TIMING IS KEY AS THERE MAY BE SOME SNOW OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF

OTHER THAN SOME STRATUS POSSIBLE ACROSS NORTHEAST CORNER...MAINLY
A TEMPERATURE FORECAST TODAY. WHILE THERE WILL BE SOME COLD
ADVECTION GOING ON...IT DOESNT LOOK PARTICULARLY STRONG. 09Z OBS

LOWS TUESDAY MORNING TO BE NEAR FREEZING.

HIGH MOVES QUICKLY TO THE EAST ON TUESDAY. AS WE WILL BE STARTING
FROM A LOWER BASE ON TUESDAY...HIGH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO BE
A LITTLE LOWER THAN TODAY. AS SYSTEM MOVES OUT OF ROCKIES TUESDAY
NIGHT...WE START TO SEE SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT...SHOWS UP PRETTY
WELL ON 285K SURFACE. GFS A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE ON BRINGING
PRECIPITATION IN QUICKER. FIRST QUESTION OF THE DAY IS WHETHER
MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION REACHES THE GROUND IN OUR CWA BEFORE 12Z
WEDNESDAY. CURRENT FORECAST SEEMS TO SHADOW THE GFS IN THIS
RESPECT. SINCE THERE IS ONLY ABOUT 3-6 HOURS DIFFERENCE IN TIMING
BETWEEN GFS AND NAM...WILL HOLD ONTO CURRENT FORECAST POPS FOR
NOW.

WEDNESDAY TO BE A RAINY DAY ANY WAY YOU CUT IT. HAVE RAISED POPS
TO CATEGORICAL DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. SEE NO REASON TO FIGHT
MAV TEMP GUIDANCE FOR WEDNESDAY. BOTH GFS AND NAM LINGER
PRECIPITATION INTO AT LEAST WEDNESDAY EVENING ACROSS THE
AREA...AND HAVE BUMPED UP POPS THERE AS WELL.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER WEDNESDAY)...
PRECIPITATION SHOULD CLEAR THE AREA BY THURSDAY MORNING. COLDER
AIR MOVES IN BEHIND THIS SYSTEM FOR 24-36 HOURS...MAINLY AFFECTING
AREAS TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA. WE WILL STILL BE BELOW NORMAL ON
TEMPS HOWEVER.

BOTH ECMWF AND GFS HAVE UPPER TROF FROM GREAT LAKES TO TEXAS OVER
THE WEEKEND...BASICALLY SOUTHWEST FLOW FOR US. OF COURSE MODELS
DIFFER ON WHICH IMPULSES COULD PROVIDE PRECIPITATION. THESE
SYSTEMS WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED BECAUSE 1000-500 MB THICKNESS
PROGS INDICATE CRITICAL THICKNESSES WOULD BE IN...OR CLOSE TO THE
CWA BY SUNDAY. FOR NOW...WILL GO THE COURSE WITH CURRENT FORECAST.

FALLING MUCH ACROSS THE AREA. THINK THAT TEMPERATURES WILL STAY
WARMER DUE TO WEAK LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION AHEAD OF THE FRONT FOR
MOST OF THE NIGHT ALONG WITH CLOUD COVER ACROSS NORTHEAST SECTIONS.
THEREFORE HAVE RAISED TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES MOST AREAS. ALSO...STILL
EXPECTING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVER NORTHEAST SECTIONS THROUGH THE
NIGHT...WITH PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS FURTHER
SOUTH. SO OTHER THAN UPDATES FOR TEMPERATURES...THE REMAINDER OF
THE FORECAST LOOKS GOOD.

UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONES OUT SHORTLY...HAVE A GOOD EVENING.

A WEAK COLD FRONT TO OUR NW WILL MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA LATE 
TONIGHT. THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME MID LEVEL CLOUDS TONIGHT AND A 
SLIGHT DROP IN TEMPERATURES FOR MONDAY. A SFC HIGH WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT AND TO THE EAST TUESDAY. DRY AND SEASONABLE 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH TUESDAY.

A RETURN WARM/MOIST ADVECTION FLOW BECOMES ESTABLISHED TUESDAY NIGHT 
AS 850-700MB WARM ADVECTION INCREASES UP TO 10C/12HR. WINDS AT THAT 
LEVEL WILL BE PERPENDICULAR WITH THE ISENTROPES...SO THIS LOOKS LIKE 
A CLASSIC OVERRUNNING SCENARIO BEGINNING LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
CONTINUING INTO WEDNESDAY. DRYING WILL OCCUR WHEN A COLD FRONT MOVES 
IN FROM THE WEST BY WEDNESDAY EVENING.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTROL THE WEATHER AGAIN THURSDAY AND FRIDAY 
PROVIDING DRY AND SEASONABLE CONDITIONS. THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN MAY 
BE SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY. MODEL SOLUTIONS ARE INCONSISTENT FOR 
THE WEEKEND WHETHER IT WILL BE DRY OR A LOW OUT OF THE GULF WILL 
PROVIDE A CHANCE OF RAIN.

A SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE REGION IS BRINGING A LOW CLOUD DECK 
FROM THE OH VALLEY INTO OUR NE COUNTIES. OTHERWISE...A SFC HIGH OVER 
TX WILL BE THE DOMINATE FEATURE TODAY WITH A WESTERLY COMPONENT IN 
THE WINDS ALONG WITH NEARLY SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES.

A FAST MOVING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA LATE TONIGHT AND 
PROVIDE ONLY A SLIGHT DROP IN TEMPERATURES MONDAY. A SFC HIGH WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT THEN MOVE TO THE EAST TUESDAY. 
DRY AND SEASONABLE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH TUESDAY.

A RETURN WAA FLOW BECOMES ESTABLISHED TUESDAY NIGHT AS 850-700MB 
WARM ADVECTION INCREASES UP TO 10C/12HR. WINDS AT THAT LEVEL 
WILL BE PERPENDICULAR WITH THE ISENTROPES...SO THIS LOOKS LIKE A

DISCUSSION...
ANOTHER IN A SEEMINGLY UNENDING STREAM OF VORTICES WILL MOVE
THROUGH THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE CWA THIS MORNING. INCREASED
MOISTURE AROUND 900 MB HAS AIDED IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CLOUD
DECK AROUND 3000 FEET THAT HAS MOVED INTO THE NORTHERN COUNTIES.
WIND SHIFT LINE HAS MOVED INTO NORTHWEST PORTIONS OF THE AREA AS
WELL. NO SIGNIFICANT TEMPERATURE OR DEWPOINT DIFFERENCE NOTED
ACROSS THIS BOUNDARY. MOST TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 35 AND 40 AT
08Z...WITH DEWPOINTS BETWEEN 25 AND 30.

SHORT TERM (THROUGH TUESDAY)...
MODELS CONSISTENT IN SWEEPING CURRENT SHORTWAVE OUT OF THE AREA
DURING THE MORNING. PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CLOUDS SHOULD DEPART AS
WELL...ALTHOUGH WOULD NOT BE SHOCKED IF FAR NE IS MOSTLY CLOUDY
ALL DAY. LOW LEVEL TEMPERATURES FROM BOTH MODELS INDICATE THAT
TODAY SHOULD BE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER THAN SATURDAY...BUT CLOUDS
LIKELY TO RETARD THIS SOMEWHAT. WILL GO ABOVE PREVIOUS
FORECAST...BUT NOT QUITE AS HIGH AS NAM WOULD INDICATE.

NEXT SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...WITH NO REAL
NOTICEABLE CHANGE. MAY SEE A COUPLE MORE DEGREES OF WARMING ON
MONDAY IN A FEW AREAS. WE GET INTO SHORTWAVE RIDGING AFTER THAT
SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH...AND EXPECT RIDGING TO HOLD UNTIL TUESDAY
NIGHT.

LONG TERM (AFTER TUESDAY)...
AS HAS BEEN THE CASE FOR SEVERAL WEEKS...NOT A LOT OF CONSISTENCY
BETWEEN MEDIUM RANGE MODELS...OR SOMETIMES WITHIN THE SAME MODEL
BETWEEN RUNS. THERE IS SOME CONSENSUS THAT A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE
THROUGH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY...BRINGING A CHANCE OF RAIN DURING
THE DAY. EXPECT TEMPERATURES WARM ENOUGH WHERE PRECIPITATION TYPE
IS NOT AN ISSUE. PRECIP SHOULD BE OUT OF THE AREA BY MIDDAY ON
THURSDAY...AND EXPECT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY TO BE DRY. 

AFTER THURSDAY...ECMWF AGAIN WANTS TO BRING IN COLDER AIR...WITH A
HIGHER AMPLITUDE PATTERN THAN GFS. BY 00Z SATURDAY...GFS AND ECMWF
HAVE AS MUCH AS 300 METER DIFFERENCE IN HEIGHTS OVER CALIFORNIA.
EARLY LOOK AT HPCS PREEPD MESSAGE INDICATES THEY ARE TRENDING
TOWARD ECMWF SOLUTION.

HAVE TRENDED MOST FORECAST TEMPERATURES UP A LITTLE...BUT NOT AS
HIGH AS GUIDANCE. THESE ADJUSTMENTS SEEM TO FIT A LITTLE BETTER
WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES.

NEEDLESS TO SAY...CONFIDENCE IN DETAILS OF FORECAST PAST WEDNESDAY
IS RATHER LOW...DUE TO POOR CONTINUITY IN MODEL SOLUTIONS.

220 PM CST SAT DEC 10 2005

.SYNOPSIS...
SOUTHWEST SURFACE FLOW AHEAD OF A PACIFIC FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE 
MIDWEST.  SYSTEM IS DRY FOR THE MIDSOUTH...EXCEPT FOR SNOW SHOWERS 
ACROSS IOWA AND ILLINOIS.  STILL SEE SOME SNOW COVER ON SATELLITE 
ACROSS FAR NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL.  TEMPS 
BELOW AVERAGE...DESPITE SOUTHWEST FLOW AND FULL SUN.

&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
FAST...NORTHWEST FLOW...WITH A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES ROTATING THROUGH 
FOR THE NEXT 36 HOURS.  FIRST SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH TONIGHT 
FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER ON SUNDAY.  NEITHER SHOULD PRODUCE ANY 
PRECIPITATION WITH THE BEST FORCING WELL EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
MAIN INFLUENCE WILL BE IN KEEPING TEMPS ON THE COOL SIDE OF 
CLIMATOLOGY.

MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE EXPECTED TO MOVE THOUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY MORNING.  MODELS MAY HAVE SLOWED DOWN A LITTLE BIT WITH 
THIS FEATURE, BUT IN GENERAL ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT. AT THIS TIME 
THERE IS NO INDICATION OF ANY FROZEN PRECIPITATION.      

&&

.LONG RANGE (AFTER WEDNESDAY)...
BIG DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF.  LOW CONFIDENCE IN THIS 
FORECAST WITH MODEL FLIPS ON EACH RUN....ALTHOUGH THE ECMWF IS MOST 
CONSISTENT.  MAIN DIFFERENCE IS STRONG SHORTWAVE WHICH DIVES 
SOUTH ALONG THE CANADIAN ROCKYS ON DAY 4.  GFS EVENTUALLY SPLITS THE 
ENERGY.  ONE SHORTWAVE HEADS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES...WHILE THE 
OTHER RETROGRESSES ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST.  THE GFS SOLUTION PUMPS 
A FLAT RIDGE ACROSS THE CENTRAL US. MUCH MILDER FOR THE MIDSOUTH.
MEANWHILE THE ECMWF TAKES THE SHORTWAVE AND REINFORCES THE TROF 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL US...WHICH IS A MUCH COLDER SOLUTION FOR THE 
MIDSOUTH.

INCLINED TO FAVOR THE ECMWF SOLUTION SINCE THE MEAN TROF HAS BEEN 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL US AND THE ECMWF HAS BEEN MOST CONSISTENT. THUS 
HAVE DECIDED TO STICK MAINLY NEAR CLIMATOLOGY OR SLIGHTLY BELOW. 
ALSO...WITH EITHER MODEL SOLUTION...NO INDICATION OF MEASURABLE 
PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE PERIOD.

SURFACE HIGH CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHEASTERN STATES AND MOVING SLOWLY
EAST. WATER VAPOR LOOP CLEARLY SHOWS SHORTWAVE MOVING QUICKLY
EAST...ENTERING NW ARKANSAS AT 0830Z. MOISTURE BEING LIFTED
NORTHEAST AHEAD OF THE SHORTWAVE. THIS IS REFLECTED BY 2500-4000
FT CLOUDS MOVING NE ACROSS ARKANSAS. EXPECT THESE CLOUDS IN
MEMPHIS METRO AREA BY ABOUT 13Z. TEMPERATURES CURRENTLY IN THE
TEENS IN MOST AREAS...BUT SHOULD RISE INTO THE 20S AS CLOUDS ARRIVE.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS SHOW 3 SEPARATE SHORTWAVES MOVING ACROSS THE CWA BY 15Z ON
SUNDAY. WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER WITH THE SHORTWAVE
THIS MORNING AND THE ONE SUNDAY MORNING...WONT REALLY NOTICE MUCH
FROM THE ONE THIS EVENING. EXPECT CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR SEVERAL
HOURS THIS MORNING...BUT AS SHORTWAVE MOVES EAST...CLOUDS SHOULD
EXIT AS WELL. THIS PERIOD OF CLOUDS WILL PREVENT TEMPERATURES FROM
REACHING THEIR MAX POTENTIAL. EVEN SO...WITH SIGNIFICANT
SUNSHINE...TEMPS SHOULD BE 10-15 DEGREES WARMER THAN FRIDAY. WHILE
WE CANT RULE OUT A FLURRY OR SPRINKLE WITH THESE SHORTWAVES...DO
NOT EXPECT MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION.

SURFACE FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH THIS EVENING. TEMPERATURES BEHIND
THE FRONT ARE ACTUALLY ABOUT 10 DEGREES WARMER THAN AHEAD OF IT.
CURRENT AIRMASS IS OF ARCTIC ORIGIN...AIRMASS BEHIND FRONT IS OF
PACIFIC ORIGIN. DEWPOINTS BEHIND FRONT IN MID-UPPER 20S...SO LOWS
TONIGHT MUCH WARMER THAN THIS MORNING.

AFTER LAST SHORTWAVE EXITS TOMORROW MORNING...H500 HEIGHTS BEGIN
RISING A LITTLE AS SYSTEM UNDERCUTS WEST COAST RIDGE. THIS ALLOWS
SHORTWAVE RIDGING TO MOVE INTO THE AREA. WE SHOULD SEE A LOT OF
SUN ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WITH TEMPERATURES MUCH CLOSER TO NORMAL
FOR MID-DECEMBER.
&&

.LONG RANGE (AFTER MONDAY)...
THIS MORNING...THERE IS AT LEAST A LITTLE BIT OF MODEL CONTINUITY
BETWEEN THE 00Z OPERATIONAL GFS AND THE 00Z ECMWF UNTIL ABOUT 00Z
THURSDAY BEFORE GOING THEIR SEPARATE WAYS. SYSTEM COMING UNDER
WEST COAST RIDGE TO PHASE SOMEWHAT WITH A NORTHERN STREAM SYSTEM
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...BRINGING A CHANCE OF RAIN BACK TO
THE AREA. THIS WAS ALREADY COVERED IN PREVIOUS FORECAST AND WILL
ALLOW THIS TO RIDE. THICKNESSES IN BOTH MODELS INDICATE ALL
PRECIPITATION WITH THIS EVENT SHOULD BE LIQUID IN OUR CWA.

DIFFERENCES BEGIN TO APPEAR ON THURSDAY...AS GFS IS A LITTLE
QUICKER TO LIFT PHASED SYSTEM OUT OF THE AREA. GFS PATTERN MUCH
LESS AMPLIFIED AFTER THURSDAY THAN ECMWF IS...AND CONSIDERABLY
WARMER. FOR EXAMPLE...500 HEIGHT AT MEM ON GFS IS 100 METERS
HIGHER THAN ECMWF AT 00Z/17. FOR NOW...WILL KEEP DRY FORECAST
AFTER WEDNESDAY...AND TREND FORECAST TEMPS UP A LITTLE...BUT NOT
QUITE TO MEX DATA.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS SITUATED OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS
EVENING. THIS HAS ALLOWED FOR CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS OVER THE
EASTERN 2/3RDS OF THE FORECAST AREA AND ALSO ALLOWED FOR THE
ATMOSPHERE TO DECOUPLE IN MOST AREAS. THEREFORE...TEMPERATURES
HAVE QUICKLY DROPPED INTO THE TEENS AND LOWER 20S AS OF 03Z.
REGIONAL SATELLITE IMAGERY IS INDICATING SCATTERED HIGH CLOUDS
MOVING INTO NORTHWEST PORTIONS OF THE AREA AHEAD OF AN UPPER LEVEL
SHORTWAVE CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS OKLAHOMA. THESE HIGH CLOUDS MAY
HELP TO SLOW TEMPERATURE FALLS ACROSS ESPECIALLY NORTHWEST
SECTIONS. BUT STILL EXPECT TEMPS IN THESE AREAS TO BOTTOM OUT IN
THE LOW AND MID TEENS. ELSEWHERE...CLOUD COVER SHOULD REMAIN
ISOLATED AT BEST AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES SHOULD CONTINUE. OVERALL
THE CURRENT FORECAST IS CLOSE TO ON TRACK. ONLY TEMPERATURE
CONCERN IS AT MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL...WHERE UPPER TEENS SHOULD BE
AS LOW AS IT SHOULD GO. BUT RURAL AREAS AWAY FROM MEMPHIS MAY
STILL SEE MID TEENS...SO WILL LEAVE FORECAST ALONE.

.DISCUSSION...

A COLD DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS.
TEMPERATURES HAVE REALLY STRUGGLED TODAY WITH MANY AREAS NOT EVEN
REACHING THE FREEZING POINT. GUIDANCE HAS NOT HANDLED TEMPERATURES
TODAY WELL AT ALL. AN UPPER VORT IS OVER COLORADO AND HIGH CLOUDS
HAVE DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO THIS VORT OVER KANSAS AND OKLAHOMA. 

PROBLEM TONIGHT IS MIN TEMPS. DEW POINTS ARE IN THE TEENS. SKIES
SHOULD BE CLEAR TO START BUT HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER
VORT MAY MOVE OVER THE REGION AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE POSITION OF THE
HIGH PRESSURE APPEARS TO BE THE KEY. WITH IT CENTERED OVER THE
REGION...WINDS SHOULD GO LIGHT EARLY THIS EVENING. WITH CLEAR
SKIES AND LOW DEW POINTS...TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY PLUMMET DURING
THE EVENING HOURS PERHAPS LEVELING OFF SOME ONCE THE HIGH CLOUDS
MOVE OVERHEAD. GUIDANCE APPEARS TO BE EXTREMELY UNRELIABLE. HAVE
DRASTICALLY UNDERCUT MIN TEMPERATURES TO NEAR DEW POINT READINGS.
WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF SINGLE DIGITS ARE REPORTED ACROSS THE
REGION. THIS MAY BE ESPECIALLY TRUE OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND
INTO THE BOOTHEEL WHERE THE SNOW PACK IN PLACE. 

THE HIGH WILL SHIFT EAST OF THE REGION TOMORROW WITH SOUTHERLY
WINDS RETURNING AT THE SURFACE. MODELS SHOW COLDER AIR AT 850MB
MOVING BACK IN BEHIND THE VORT. AM REAL UNCERTAIN AS TO WHETHER OR
NOT THE GUIDANCE HIGH TEMPS FOR TOMORROW WILL EVEN BE REALIZED
ESPECIALLY SINCE TEMPERATURES WILL BE STARTING FROM A MUCH LOWER
BASE THAN MODELS SUGGEST. ALSO THE NAM SHOWS SOME STRATUS AT 850MB
MOVING UP FROM THE SOUTH PERHAPS MOVING AS FAR NORTH AS THE TN/MS
LINE. GFS DOES NOT SHOW THESE CLOUDS MOVING THIS FAR NORTH. ONLY
HESITATION IN NOT LOWERING TEMPS FOR TOMORROW IS UNCERTAINTY IN
THE IMPACT OF THE SOUTHERLY WINDS. 

A CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA TOMORROW NIGHT. THIS
WILL BRING A REINFORCING DOSE OF COLD AIR TO THE REGION. NAM SHOWS
A GOOD DEAL OF LOW CLOUDS BEHIND THE SYSTEM. CLOUDS PLUS WINDS
REMAINING UP SHOULD PREVENT TEMPS WARMER. LOW LEVELS WAY TOO DRY
TO MENTION ANY PRECIP.

BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND DRY WEATHER WILL STICK AROUND UNTIL
EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH THAT IS OVER THE
REGION BEING REPLACED BY A SHORTWAVE RIDGE. THIS WOULD TRANSLATE
INTO WARMER TEMPERATURES. GFS SHOWS A SHORTWAVE SCOOTING THROUGH
THE REGION ON TUESDAY. THIS COULD PRODUCE A CHANCE FOR RAIN. TOO
WARM FOR SNOW. FROM MIDWEEK ONWARD...ALL BETS ARE OFF. MODELS
CONTINUE TO JUMP AROUND WITH THE UPPER PATTERN FROM DAY TO DAY.
WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY UNTIL MORE CONSISTENCY IS REALIZED.

LOW CLOUDS HAVE EXITED MOST OF THE CWA THIS EVENING THANKS TO WNW
TO NW WINDS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE EXITING 500 MB SHORTWAVE. LOW
LEVEL COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE ALL NIGHT...USHERING IN
COLDER TEMPERATURES AND EVEN LOWER DEWPOINTS. HAVE MADE A FEW
ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPERATURES TONIGHT. A 1 TO 2 INCH SNOW IS ON THE
GROUND IN EXTREME NE ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL.
TEMPERATURES IN THESE LOCATIONS ARE ALREADY NEAR 20. GIVEN THE
SNOW COVER...CLEAR SKIES...LOWER DEWPOINTS...AND CONTINUED
CAA...HAVE DECIDED TO DROP TEMPS THERE ABOUT A CATEGORY. 

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS BANDS OF CIRRUS CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS NE
MISSISSIPPI. GFS PICKS THIS UP WELL IN ITS 250 MB RH FIELD AND
DOES NOT SHOW IT EXITING THE AREA UNTIL AFTER 12Z. THIS LOOKS
CONSISTENT WITH THE LATEST SATELLITE. THEREFORE...HAVE BUMPED
TEMPS UP A CATEGORY FROM TUPELO SOUTHWARD AS THE THICKER CIRRUS
WILL NOT ALLOW TEMPS TO FALL AS MUCH AS THEY OTHERWISE WOULD.
TEMPS AND OTHER FORECAST PARAMETERS LOOK GOOD FOR THE REST OF THE 
AREA.

WE SPOKE WITH SEVERAL OF THE SHERIFFS OFFICES FROM NE AR...THE
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL...AND NW TN. ALL REPORTS ARE THAT ROAD
CONDITIONS ARE IN GOOD SHAPE WITH JUST SLICK SPOTS ON A FEW RURAL
BRIDGES. THANKS TO EVERYBODY TODAY FOR THEIR WINTER WEATHER

.DISCUSSION...

RADAR SHOWS DRY SHOWS THE BACK EDGE OF THE PRECIPITATION BEGINNING
TO WORK INTO EASTERN ARKANSAS AND NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI. THE
FREEZING LINE APPEARS TO LIE JUST SOUTH OF JONESBORO TO
BLYTHEVILLE...DYERSBURG AND OVER TOWARD HUNTINGDON. TEMPERATURES
ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN STEADY THROUGH THE AFTERNOON OR AT LEAST AS
LONG AS THE PRECIP IS AROUND. THE TIMING OF THE PRECIPITATION
ACROSS THE AREA LOOKS REASONABLE SO WILL ALLOW THE ADVISORIES THAT
ARE DUE TO EXPIRE AT NOON TO DO SO. WILL CANCEL ADVISORIES FROM
LAUDERDALE COUNTY TO CROCKETT AND MADISON SOUTHWARD. WILL CONTINUE
ADVISORIES NORTH OF THIS LINE WITH THESE AREAS SITTING ON THE
FREEZING POINT SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS REMAIN POSSIBLE. WILL
ISSUE UPDATED STATEMENTS AND FORECAST AT NOON.

UPDATED FORECAST FOR TEMPERATURE TRENDS THIS MORNING. NO CHANGES
MADE TO PRECIP FORECAST. RADAR CONTINUES TO SHOW AN AREA OF PRECIP
ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION. HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS OF 1-2 INCHES OF
SNOW NORTH OF JONESBORO...A MIX FROM FORREST CITY TO BLYTHEVILLE
INTO NORTHWEST TENNESSEE. NO MAJOR ICE ACCUMULATIONS AND NONE ARE
EXPECTED. HOWEVER ROADS COULD BECOME JUST SLICK ENOUGH FOR SOME
PROBLEMS. FURTHER SOUTH...ALONG THE I-40 CORRIDOR...TEMPS ARE
HOVERING JUST ABOVE FREEZING. WITH PRECIP IN THE AREA AND WINDS
OUT OF THE NORTH FEEL UNCOMFORTABLE TO REMOVE ADVISORY IN THIS
AREA AT THIS TIME. PRECIPITATION SHOULD COME TO AN END EAST OF THE
RIVER AROUND NOON...ACROSS EXTREME WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHWEST MS
BY 2PM OR SO...LATE THIS AFTERNOON FOR REMAINING AREAS. LOCAL
STORM REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE ON THE WEB SITE...WWW.SRH.NOAA.GOV/MEG.

DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG GULF COAST ALONG WITH AN
UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL TRACK ALONG SOUTHERN
NEBRASKA INTO NORTHERN MISSOURI WILL HELP SPREAD A VARIETY OF
PRECIPITATION TYPES INTO THE MIDSOUTH TODAY. LATEST RADAR IMAGES
SHOW RADAR ECHOES MOVING IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST ALTHOUGH NOTHING IS
HITTING THE GROUND YET SINCE THE LOWER LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
ARE STILL PRETTY DRY. EXPECT THE LAYERS TO MOISTEN BY THIS MORNING
ALLOWING FOR PRECIP TO BEGIN REACHING THE SFC. WITH REGARDS TO

ADDED FAYETTE COUNTY TO WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY

.DISCUSSION...
WINTER WEATHER EVENT TRYING TO GET STARTED OVER ARKANSAS THIS 
EVENING. SOME REPORTS OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS CONFIRMED SOME LIGHT 
SNOW AROUND CONWAY...AND REGIONAL RADAR ANIMATION INDICATES SOME 
SMALL AREAS OF SLEET OR HEAVIER SNOW SHOWERS. FARTHER WEST...OVER 
NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA...SNOW HAS BEEN FALLING AROUND THE TULSA AREA FOR 
THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS. THE ARCTIC FRONT HAS MOVED THROUGH THIS 
REGION AND CURRENTLY WAS LOCATED FROM FORT SMITH TO LONGVIEW TO 
VICTORIA. THE INVERTED TROUGH WAS LOCATED ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS.

TEMPERATURES OVER THE MIDSOUTH HAVE BEEN AROUND 30 OVER THE NORTHERN 
THIRD...UPPER 30S OVER THE CENTRAL THIRD AND LOWER TO MID 40S ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN THIRD. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION WAS SEEN ALONG THE 
TROUGH AXIS...MAINLY ALONG THE TEXAS/LOUISIANA STATE LINE. THIRTY 
DEGREE DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY BUILDING NORTHWARD INTO NORTHWEST 
MS. 

SATELLITE IMAGERY WAS INDICATING SOME CLOUD ENHANCEMENTS ALONG THE 
MAIN JET AXIS. THIS...COMBINED WITH ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE WILL BE WHERE 
THE BEST DYNAMICS WILL BE LOCATED. THIS AXIS WILL SHIFT EASTWARD 
OVERNIGHT.

THE DEWPOINTS ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH RANGED FROM THE UPPER TEENS ACROSS 
THE NORTH...LOWER AND MID 20S ELSEWHERE. THE LATEST MODEL SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE A DRY LAYER BELOW 4 KFT. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ON AMOUNT 
OF PRECIP...HOWEVER THE DRY LAYERS DO SUGGEST LIGHTER AMOUNTS THAN 
PREVIOUS RUNS. THE SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL BE CRITICAL AS THE 
FREEZING LINE IS ILL DEFINED. BEST PLACEMENT WILL PROBABLY PUT IT 
ALONG OR JUST NORTH OF I-40. THE TIMING OF THE ONSET OF THE PRECIP 
WILL BE CLOSE TO 7AM OVER THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA...AND SLIGHTLY 
SOONER OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS.

A BAND OF FREEZING RAIN...PERHAPS MIXED WITH SLEET WILL PROBABLY 
OCCUR BETWEEN AREAS ROUGHLY ALONG I-40 AND NORTH TO WYNNE AR TO 
PARIS TN. WE BELIEVE THAT SNOW WILL BE LIKELY ABOVE THE WYNNE TO 
PARIS LINE. ALL AMOUNTS WILL REMAIN LIGHT. WE WILL BE ISSUING A 
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR AREAS ALONG I-40 AND NORTHWARD.

THE TIMING OF THE FROZEN PRECIPITATION WILL BE AROUND RUSH-HOUR 
TRAFFIC. BELIEVE THAT THE GREATEST CHANCES FOR FROZEN PRECIP TO 
AFFECT THE MEMPHIS AREA WILL BE FROM 5 AM TO 9 AM. AFTER 9 AM 
TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO RISE ABOVE FREEZING IN THE MEMPHIS AREA. 

AREAS THAT SEE SNOW...SHOULD SEE IT ENDING BY THE AFTERNOON.

GENERALLY AREAS SOUTH OF I-40 WILL REMAIN ALL RAIN...SUCH AS NORTH 
MISSISSIPPI.

MANY GRIDS WILL NEED TO BE REWORKED...SO ZONES MAY BE SLIGHTLY 
DELAYED. WE WILL WORK HARD TO GET THESE OUT AS QUICKLY AS 
POSSIBLE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
254 PM CST WED DEC 7 2005

.DISCUSSION...

CURRENTLY...MID AND HIGH CLOUDS RACING INTO THE REGION WITH A BRISK
NE SURFACE WIND AT 10 TO 15 MPH. TEMPS HAVE ONLY WARMED INTO THE
MID 30S NORTH TO MID 40S SOUTH WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 20S. 

TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...CONFIDENCE IN THE FORECAST CONTINUES TO BE
LOW AND THE 12Z MODEL RUN HAS DONE LITTLE TO CLARIFY THE
SITUATION. POTENTIAL STILL EXISTS FOR WINTER WEATHER EVENT OVER
PARTS OF THE AREA LATE TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY.

A STRONG 500 MB LOW WL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO CNTRL PLAINS BY 12Z
THU. MEANWHILE A SURFACE LOW WILL DEVELOP OVER THE NORTHERN GULF
WITH AN INVERTED TROF OVER THE EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH
BY 12Z THU. COLD AIR WL REMAIN IN PLACE ON THE WEST/NORTHWEST SIDE
OF THE INVERTED TROF SETTING THE STAGE FOR A WINTRY MIX. BY 00Z FRI 
A SURFACE LOW WL DEVELOP OVER THE OH VALLEY AND RACE NORTHEAST
ALONG WITH THE UPPER LOW THU NIGHT.

THE 12Z ETA AND GFS ARE IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THESE SYNOPTIC
SCALE FEATURES. THE BIG DIFFERENCES LIE IN THE LIFT AND MOISTURE AS
THE SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. THE ETA IS THE BULLISH MODEL...
ORGANIZING THE SYSTEM MORE QUICKLY. ETA QPFS RANGE FROM AROUND 0.20
INCHES ACRS NE AR TO 0.75 INCHES OVER NE MS. THE GFS IS MUCH DRIER
AND LESS ORGANIZED WITH ONLY A TRACE ACRS NE AR TO ABOUT 0.5
INCHES OVER NE MS. THE GFS IS INDICATING THAT A DRY SLOT WILL WORK
INTO THE AREA AND CUT OFF PRECIP QUICKLY...ESPECIALLY ACRS EASTERN
AR. THE ECMWF...CANADIAN AND NGM MODELS ALSO HINT AT THIS.

GIVEN THE UNCERTAINITY OF QPF AMOUNT WL HOLD OFF ON ANY ADVISORIES
ATTM. HAVE BASICALLY GONE WITH A BLEND OF THE ETA AND GFS QPF
AMOUNTS FOR THIS FORECAST. USING ETA MODEL SOUNDINGS EXPECT ALL
SNOW ACRS EXTREME NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WITH 1-2 INCHES AS A
POTENTIAL ACCUMULATION. JUST TO THE SOUTH ACROSS THE PARIS-
DYERSBURG-JONESBORO REGION EXPECT A MIX OF SNOW...SLEET AND SOME
FREEZING RAIN WITH PERHAPS AN INCH TOTAL. THE JACKSON-MEMPHIS-
MARIANNA (I-40 CORRIDOR) WILL SEE A MIX OF RAIN...FREEZING RAIN
AND SLEET CHANGING TO MOSTLY RAIN DURING THE MORNING. LIGHT ICING
COULD OCCUR IN THIS AREA. AREAS JUST TO THE SOUTH...FROM SELMER-
HOLLY SPRINGS-CLARKSDALE...COULD SEE A BRIEF PERIOD OF FREEZING
RAIN IN THE MORNING WITH NO SIGNIFICANT ICING. 

THERE WL BE A CHANCE OF PRECIP AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH PERHAPS A
FEW SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES THIS EVENING. VERY DRY AIRMASS ACROSS
THE REGION SHOULD PREVENT PRECIP FROM STARTING TOO EARLY. WL CONT
LIKELY POPS FOR THU THOUGH AGAIN IT IS THE QPF AMOUNT THAT IS THE
BIG QUESTION. ANY PRECIP WL TAPER OFF RAPIDLY DURING THE
AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING AS THE SYSTEM MOVES QUICKLY TO THE
NORTHEAST.

THIS EVENT CONTINUES TO BE MONITORED AND AN WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY MAY NEED TO BE ISSUED BY UPCOMING SHIFTS. WL ISSUE AN SPS
WITH THE FORECAST PACKAGE TO HIGHLIGHT THE POSSIBILITY OF WINTER
WEATHER FOR LATE TONIGHT AND THU.

EXTENDED...MEAN TROF OVER THE EASTERN U.S. MEANS CONTINUED COLD NW
FLOW ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AND MAINLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPS.

DISCUSSION...  

HIGH PRESSURE HAS SHIFTED EAST THIS MORNING. LATEST SATELLITE IMAGES 
SHOW HIGH CLOUDS DRIFTING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE 
COUNTRY WHILE LOW TO MID CLOUDS ARE LOCATED NORTHWEST OF THE AREA 
ACROSS MISSOURI AND KANSAS. THE HIGH CLOUDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A 
DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE GULF COAST WHILE THE LOW 
AND MID CLOUDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL LOW. EXPECT THE 
MIDSOUTH TO STAY BETWEEN THE TWO AREAS OF CLOUDS TODAY. THIS SHOULD 
ALLOW FOR MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS THE CWA.

BY TONIGHT...CLOUDS FROM THESE TWO SYSTEMS WILL BEGIN TO FILTER INTO 
THE AREA. THE POTENTIAL FOR WINTER WEATHER FROM THESE TWO SYSTEMS IS 
BECOMING LESS CERTAIN WITH EACH MODEL RUN. THE LATEST RUN IS MUCH 
WARMER THAN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT. THE MODELS ARE PRETTY CONSISTENT 
WITH POSITION OF THE UPPER LOW TO TRACK ACROSS SOUTHERN 
NEBRASKA/NORTHERN KANSAS INTO NORTHERN MISSOURI WHILE THE SFC LOW 
STAYS SOUTH OF THE GULF COAST. THE LOCATIONS OF THE TWO SYSTEMS IS 
NOT IDEAL FOR ANY MAJOR WINTER WEATHER ACCUMULATION THUS ANY THAT 
OCCURS SHOULD ONLY WARRANT AN ADVISORY IF THAT. NO ADVISORY WILL BE 
ISSUED AT THIS TIME AS IT IS STILL TOO EARLY TO KNOW WHAT WILL 
HAPPEN. WITH THAT IN MIND CURRENT THINKING IS TO EXPECT EXTREME 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS(POCAHONTAS...WALNUT RIDGE AREA) TO RECEIVE MAINLY 
JUST SNOW. AMOUNTS MAY RANGE FROM 1 TO 3 INCHES. SOUTH OF THIS AREA 
FROM JONESBORO TO UNION CITY TO SEE A MIX OF FREEZING 
RAIN...SLEET...AND SNOW. AMOUNTS WILL BE AROUND AN INCH. FURTHER 
SOUTH...FROM EAST CENTRAL ARKANSAS TO PARIS TN INCLUDING THE MEMPHIS 
METRO AREA...EXPECT A MIX OF RAIN...FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET WITH 
AMOUNTS LESS THAN AN INCH. FURTHER SOUTH ACROSS THE REST OF NORTH 
MISSISSIPPI TO NEAR SAVANNAH TN...EXPECT ALL RAIN. CAN NOT STRESS 
ENOUGH THAT THERE IS STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE FORECAST 
AND IF MODEL RUNS CONTINUE TO SHOW WARMER CONDITIONS...MEMPHIS METRO 
COULD EASILY SEE ONLY RAIN. PLEASE STAY TUNED. EXPECT MOST OF THE 
PRECIP TO START OUT THURSDAY MORNING AND WILL END BY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO EARLY THURSDAY EVENING.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH BEHIND THE SYSTEMS FOR 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL MAINLY BE IN THE 40S AND 50S FOR 
HIGHS AND 20S FOR LOWS.

A DRY COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT FOLLOWED 
BY AN UPPER TROUGH ON SUNDAY. A FEW LOCATIONS ACROSS NORTHWEST 
TENNESSEE MAY SEE A FEW FLURRIES WITH THE TROUGH.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REBUILD BEHIND THE FRONT FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REBOUND INTO THE 50S FOR HIGHS BY MONDAY 
WITH LOWS IN THE 20S AND 30S.

ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MAY DEVELOP ALONG THE GULF COAST TOWARD 
THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD BUT MODELS ARE NOT PUTTING OUT A LOT 
OF PRECIP WITH THE SYSTEM.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
320 AM CST TUE DEC 6 2005

.DISCUSSION...  

...POSSIBLE WINTER WEATHER TO AFFECT THE MIDSOUTH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
   INTO EARLY THURSDAY EVENING...

HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE WEATHER ACROSS THE 
MIDSOUTH IN THE SHORT TERM. EXPECT MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES TODAY WITH 
TEMPERATURES REMAINING ON THE COOL SIDE WITH HIGHS IN THE 40S. 
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN COLD TONIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE UPPER TEENS 
INTO THE 20S WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. 

THE HIGH WILL SHIFT EAST TONIGHT ALLOWING FOR A SFC LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM TO DEVELOP ALONG THE GULF COAST ON WEDNESDAY.  IN 
ADDITION...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL MOVE OUT OF THE ROCKIES INTO THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS.  CLOUDS FROM THESE TWO SYSTEMS WILL BEGIN TO MOVE 
INTO THE MIDSOUTH ON WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES IN 
THE UPPER 30S INTO THE MID 40S FOR HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY. MODELS ARE IN 
PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT PRECIP WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL AROUND 
MIDNIGHT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WITH COLD TEMPERATURES IN PLACE...MAJORITY 
OF PRECIP THAT FALLS WILL BE WINTER WEATHER TYPE. THE FORECASTING 
PROBLEMS COME WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE SFC LOW ALONG THE GULF COAST. 
THIS LEAVES MAJOR UNCERTAINTY WITH PRECIP AMOUNTS. THE NAM IS MUCH 
STRONGER WITH THE LOW THUS IS PRODUCING HIGHER PRECIP AMOUNTS THAN 
THE GFS. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE GFS SINCE POSITION OF SFC LOW IS 
PRETTY FAR SOUTH AND UPPER LOW WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE AREA. THIS 
WILL LEAVE THE AREA WITH PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS ON THE LIGHT SIDE. 
EXPECT RAIN/SNOW LINE TO BE SOUTH OF MEMPHIS...ROUGHLY AROUND WEST 
HELENA...OXFORD...TO SAVANNAH LINE. AROUND THIS LINE WILL SEE A 
MIXTURE OF PRECIP BEFORE CHANGING TO ALL SNOW. FOR THE MEMPHIS 
METRO...EXPECT PRECIP TO MAYBE TO INITIALLY START OUT AS SLEET 
QUICKLY SWITCHING TO SNOW. FURTHER NORTH WILL SEE ALL SNOW. TUPELO 
AREA WILL SEE ALL RAIN. FOR AMOUNTS EXPECT(STILL A LOT OF 
UNCERTAINTY)...MEMPHIS METRO NORTHWARD TO SEE A TOTAL OF 1-3 INCHES 
WHEN ITS ALL SAID AND DONE. FOR LOCATIONS NEAR THE RAIN/SNOW LINE 
WILL SEE AN INCH OR LESS ON THE GROUND. EXPECT PRECIP TO COME TO AN 
END BY 00Z THURSDAY EVENING FOR WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH AND 
AROUND 06Z FOR EASTERN SECTIONS.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REBUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH BEHIND THE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM FOR THE WEEKEND. A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR BY THE 
LATTER PART OF THE WEEKEND. EXPECT HIGHS BACK INTO THE 50S BY 
SUNDAY. 

ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL APPROACH THE 
MIDSOUTH ON MONDAY. EXPECT AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER BUT RAIN WILL 
HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

DISCUSSION...
..POSSIBLE WINTER STORM TO AFFECT THE MIDSOUTH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
   INTO THURSDAY...

THE MAJOR PROBLEMS FOR THE MIDSOUTH AND THIS FORECAST PERIOD WILL BE 
THE WINTER STORM THAT WILL LIKELY IMPACT THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND THURSDAY.

THIS STORM SYSTEM WILL BEGIN AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH DIGGING INTO THE 
NORTHERN ROCKIES TUESDAY MORNING. THE WEATHER OVER THE MIDSOUTH WILL 
REMAIN COOLER THAN NORMAL AND CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION WILL REMAIN 
LOW UNTIL WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH DEEPENS INTO SOUTHEASTERN COLORADO BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. THE COLD AIR THAT MOVED INTO THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY...WILL 
BE REINFORCED TOMORROW. THIS MAKES THINGS INTERESTING WHEN THE STORM 
SYSTEM MOVES CLOSER TO THE MIDSOUTH. FORECAST SOUNDINGS FROM BOTH 
THE GFS AND NAM SUPPORT SNOW FOR AT LEAST THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BEGINNING LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A MIXTURE OF SLEET...
FREEZING RAIN...SNOW AND RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS PARTS OF WEST 
TENNESSEE AND PARTS OF NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. 

VERY STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL OCCUR OVER MOST OF THE AREA...AHEAD 
OF THE UPPER LOW. PW VALUES INCREASE TO THREE QUARTERS OF INCH FOR 
SEVERAL AREAS ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. 

IT APPEARS THAT BY THURSDAY MORNING...A WINTRY MIX WILL CONTINUE TO 
POSE POSSIBLE PROBLEMS FOR AREAS ALONG AND SOUTH OF A LINE FROM WEST 
HELENA TO SOMERVILLE TO SAVANNAH. A CHANGE OVER TO ALL RAIN SHOULD 
OCCUR IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS IN THE TUPELO AND SOUTH AREAS. BY 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON THE ISENTROPIC LIFT DECREASES RAPIDLY AND WOULD 
EXPECT PRECIP TO BE ON THE DECREASE.

THE FORECAST FOR THIS TIME FRAME WILL BECOME MORE DEFINITE TOMORROW 
AND OF COURSE...WEDNESDAY. LATEST THINKING COULD BRING UP TO 6 
INCHES OF SNOW ACROSS NE AR...MO BOOTHEEL AND EXTREME NORTHWEST TN. 
THE WORST CASE SCENARIO FOR THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA WILL BE 3 
INCHES...HOWEVER SOME SNOW MAY CHANGE OVER TO FREEZING RAIN/SLEET 
BEFORE IT ALL ENDS THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 

AFTER THIS SYSTEM PASSES AND THE PRECIP ENDS...TEMPERATURES WILL 
GRADUALLY WARM INTO THE UPPER 40S BY SATURDAY. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL 
BE TRICKY DEPENDING ON POSSIBLE SNOW COVER/DEPTH.

RAIN HAS FINALLY MOVED OUT OF THE MIDSOUTH WITH RESPECT TO THE
LAST FRONT. CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY CLEAR OUT FROM THE WEST
DURING THE DAY. WINDS WILL BE NORTHERLY AND GUSTY TDA DUE TO A
HIGH IN KS.

CONTINUED DRY COLD WEATHER IS SCHEDULED TONIGHT THROUGH WED AS
ARCTIC AIR KEEPS ON COMING DOWN INTO THE AREA.

AFTER THAT...MODELS INDICATE AN UPPER CUT OFF LOW WILL BE IN THE
CENTRAL PLAINS THAT WILL MOVE EAST TO OHIO BY THURSDAY EVENING.
THIS TROUGH WILL GENERATE KIND OF AN INVERTED TROUGH AT THE
SURFACE. NET RESULT IS THAT WINTER COULD ARRIVE IN EARNEST.
FROZEN PCPN IS LIKELY. THE NORTHERN COUNTIES COULD GET SNOW WHILE
THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE MIDSOUTH GETS A MIX OF RAIN/FREEZING
RAIN/SLEET/SNOW.

FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON...NORTHWESTERLY UPPER FLOW SHOULD
DOMINATE. THIS WILL PRODUCE DRY WEATHER WITH COLD DAYS AND COLD

.DISCUSSION...

A MUCH COLDER AIRMASS HAS FILTERED INTO THE MID-SOUTH TODAY BEHIND
A COLD FRONT THAT MOVED ACROSS THE AREA LAST NIGHT AND IS NOW
POSITIONED ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. THE MID AND UPPER
LEVEL FLOW HAS REMAINED SOUTHWESTERLY AND THIS HAS CAUSED THE
FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO STALL AND ALSO ALLOWED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
ORIGINATING ALONG THE GULF COAST TO BE ISENTROPICALLY LIFTED UP
AND OVER THE BOUNDARY ACROSS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF OUR AREA. THIS
HAS ALLOWED CONTINUED AND PERSISTANT DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON ACROSS MAINLY NORTH
MISSISSIPPI. THUNDERSTORMS THAT HAVE DEVELOPED HAVE REMAINED
ELEVATED AND WITH COLD MID LEVEL TEMPERATURES COMBINED WITH DECENT
ELEVATED INSTABILITY...SEVERAL OF THESE STORMS HAVE PRODUCED SMALL
HAIL. THIS SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS.

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH DIGGING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES THIS
AFTERNOON WILL HELP TO INDUCE A WEAK SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
ALONG THE FRONT ACROSS SOUTHEAST MISSISSIPPI LATE THIS
AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT. THIS IN
COMBINATION WITH CONTINUED ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE FRONT AND WEAK
LARGE SCALE LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A STRONG
140+ KT UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK...SHOULD KEEP PRECIPITATION GOING
ACROSS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA TONIGHT. AT THE SAME
TIME...COLD AIR WILL CONTINUE TO FILTER SOUTHWARD TOWARDS THE
DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. AS THIS OCCURS...ENOUGH COLD AIR
MAY FILTER INTO PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE (MAINLY FROM JACKSON
TENNESSEE AND POINTS SOUTH AND EAST) AND FAR NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI
(NORTH AND EAST OF TUPELO MISSISSIPPI) BEFORE THE PRECIPITATION
ENDS TO ALLOW FOR A PERIOD OF RAIN MIXED WITH SNOW OR ALL SNOW.
THIS HAS BEEN SUPPORTED BY 12Z/18Z NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS ACROSS
THESE AREAS. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE
LIGHT AND ONLY EXPECTING A BRIEF PERIOD OF FROZEN PRECIPITATION AT
BEST. IN ADDITION...TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE HOVERING AT OR JUST
ABOVE FREEZING AND WITH WARM GROUND TEMPERATURES...NOT EXPECTING
MUCH IN THE WAY OF ACCUMULATION AT THIS TIME. BUT STILL A TASTE OF
WINTER IS POSSIBLE AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT FOR PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH.

THE STORM SYSTEM SHOULD LIFT NORTHEAST OUT OF THE AREA ON MONDAY
MORNING...BRINGING AN END TO ANY LEFT OVER PRECIPITATION. THEN
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN WITH DRY AND UNSEASONABLY COLD
TEMPERATURES. DRY AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE
THROUGH TUESDAY...WITH SOME SLIGHT MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES...YET
STILL BELOW NORMAL AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES EAST. IN THE
UPPER LEVELS...A LARGE LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL COVER THE EASTERN
UNITED STATES. BY TUESDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE IS
FORECAST TO DIVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE BASE OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH
AND HELP PUSH AN ARCTIC COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA. FOLLOWING THIS
FRONT...MUCH COLDER AIR...WELL BELOW NORMAL...SHOULD FILTER INTO
THE REGION. THE UPPER DISTURBANCE SHOULD HANG BACK BEHIND THE
FRONT ON WEDNESDAY BEFORE APPROACHING THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
THERE MAY BE A CHANCE FOR A FEW FLURRIES ON WEDNESDAY AS THE UPPER
DISTURBANCE ATTEMPTS TO SQUEEZE OUT ANY AVAILABLE MOISTURE. 

THEN THE FORECAST BECOMES TRICKY AS THE FORECAST MODELS CONTINUE
TO DIVERGE CONCERNING THE HANDLING OF THE UPPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH.
THE LATEST 12/18Z RUNS OF THE NAM AND THE 04/12Z RUN OF THE ECMWF
AMPLIFY THE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON SHORTWAVE TROUGH MORE SHARPLY...ALLOWING
FOR AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH AND OVERRUNNING MOISTURE TO BE
PULLED BACK OVER THE COLD AIRMASS AND INTRODUCING THE POSSIBILITY
FOR A WINTER WEATHER SITUATION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY OVER
OUR AREA. THE 12Z GFS IS LESS AMPLIFIED WITH THE SHORTWAVE AND
MORE PROGRESSIVE...ALLOWING THE SHORTWAVE TO BE QUICKLY SHUNTED
EAST AND CLOSING THE GULF...THEREFORE LEAVING THE AREA COLD AND
DRY. SO WITH SO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AND CONTINUITY WITH THE FORECAST
MODELS AT THIS RANGE...FELT IT BEST TO KEEP A DRY FORECAST GOING
UNTIL THE MODELS COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT. ALSO WANT TO AVOID
FLIP FLOPPING THE FORECAST. NEEDLESS TO SAY INTERESTING THINGS TO
WATCH FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. AFTER THIS SYSTEM DEPARTS...EXPECT
DRY AND SLIGHTLY WARMER WEATHER FOR THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEKEND.

.UPDATE...

THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH LAST
NIGHT IS NOW SITUATED OVER CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. THIS BOUNDARY
SHOULD NOT MOVE TOO MUCH FURTHER SOUTH...AS THE MID AND UPPER FLOW
REMAINS SOUTHWESTERLY AND ALIGNED WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. MUCH
COOLER AIR HAS FILTERED SOUTH INTO THE AREA...AND TEMPERATURES
WILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME RISING MUCH TODAY AS LOW LEVEL COLD AIR
ADVECTION CONTINUES OVER THE AREA. ALSO...LOOKING AT WET
CONDITIONS CONTINUING OVER PRIMARILY NORTH MISSISSIPPI TODAY AS
MOISTURE CONTINUES TO BE ADVECTED AND LIFTED UP AND OVER THE
SLOWING FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR SOUTH. DECENT ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE
WAS NOTED ON THE 295K THETA SURFACE WITH LOW CONDENSATION PRESSURE
DEFICITS. THIS IS ALSO REFLECTED IN THE LATEST RADAR REFLECTIVITY
SHOWING GOOD COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
STRETCHED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF OUR AREA. GOOD ISENTROPIC
LIFT WILL CONTINUE OVER THESE AREAS...IN ADDITION TO SOME LARGE
SCALE ASCENT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A
STRENTHENING MID AND UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK CUTTING ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY (125/115 KT AT 200/250 MB NOTED FROM THE SGF/LZK
12Z SOUNDINGS). SO WITH ALL THIS IN MIND HAVE BUMPED UP POPS

TODAY.

.DISCUSSION...

A RATHER COMPLEX FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
CENTERED OVER NORTHWEST ARKANSAS CONINUES TO MOVE NORTHEAST. A
WARM FRONT THAT EXTENDS EAST FROM THIS LOW PRESSURE CENTER
STRETCHES FROM JUST NORTH OF MEMPHIS TO JUST NORTH OF TUPELO AS OF
21Z. TO THE SOUTH OF THIS FRONT...UNSEASONABLY WARM AND HUMID
WEATHER EXISTS...WITH TEMPERATURES CLIMBING INTO THE 70S AND
DEWPOINTS SURGING INTO THE LOW 60S. SKIES ALSO CONTINUE TO CLEAR
BEHIND THE WARM FRONT. FURTHER TO THE NORTH OF THE WARM
FRONT...LOW CLOUDS ARE HANGING ON AND TEMPERATURES REMAIN IN THE
50S WITH EVEN LOWER DEWPOINTS. THE WARM FRONT SHOULD CONTINUE TO
ADVANCE NORTHWARD BEFORE BEGINNING TO STALL ACROSS NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL PLACE THE SOUTHERN TWO-
THIRDS OF THE MID-SOUTH INTO THE WARM SECTOR. 

ALTHOUGH THE ATMOSPHERE IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE IN THE
LOWER LEVELS ACROSS THE WARM SECTOR THIS AFTERNOON...IT ALSO REMAINS
CAPPED THIS AFTERNOON WITH NO UPPER LEVEL FORCING TO LIFT THE
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE THROUGH THE CAP AT THIS TIME. THIS WILL CREATE
SOME PROBLEMS WITH DEVELOPING SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY ACROSS THE
WARM SECTOR. ATMOSPHERIC PARAMETERS ACROSS THE WARM SECTOR WILL
CONTINUE TO BECOME INCREASINGLY FAVORABLE FOR SEVERE WEATHER LATER
THIS EVENING...WITH MLCAPES AND SUFFICIENT DEEP LAYER SHEAR TO
SUPPORT SUPERCELL STRUCTURES. THE PROBLEM WILL BE THAT THE MID-
LEVEL FORCING HANGS BACK BEHIND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND WILL NOT
BECOME FAVORABLE FOR LIFT UNTIL LATER TONIGHT TO THE NORTH OF THE FRONT.
AS THE LOW PRESSURE LIFTS NORTHEAST IT SHOULD DRAG THE COLD FRONT
ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH LATER THIS EVENING. AS THE FRONT MOVES ACROSS
THE AREA AND THE FAVORABLE ENTRANCE REGION OF A 70+ KNOT MID LEVEL
JET TRAILS JUST BEHIND THE FRONT...THUNDERSTORMS WILL BEGIN TO
DEVELOP. AT THIS POINT IT APPEARS THAT DEVELOPMENT AHEAD OF THE
FRONT MAY REMAIN LIMITED...WITH THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING JUST BEHIND
THE FRONT AND REMAINING ELEVATED. SHEAR AND INSTABILITY ABOVE THE
INCREASINGLY STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL STILL SUPPORT ROTATING
SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS WITH A PRIMARILY LARGE HAIL THREAT. THERE IS
STILL SOME SMALL POTENTIAL FOR THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP
IMMEDIATELY ALONG THE FRONT LATER TONIGHT ACROSS PORTIONS OF
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR...THEN ANY SURFACED
BASED STORMS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE LARGE
HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS...AND AN ISOLATED TORNADO. ALTHOUGH AGAIN
THE THREAT FOR SURFACE BASED CONVECTION LOOKS LESS LIKELY AT THIS
POINT.

ONCE THE INITIAL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES EAST OF THE AREA...THE
TRAILING COLD FRONT SHOULD DROP SOUTH INTO NORTH CENTRAL
MISSISSIPPI AND STALL AS A MORE POTENT SHORTWAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST
ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES AND INDUCES THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE FRONT TO OUR SOUTH. THIS SECONDARY
LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPMENT WILL HELP TO REDEVELOP PRECIPITATION
ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI...WITH DECREASING CHANCES FURTHER
NORTHWARD INTO SOUTHERN TENNESSEE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. FURTHER
NORTH ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS...ONLY CLOUD COVER IS EXPECTED.
TEMPERATURES WILL GET CLOSE TO CRITICAL LEVELS FOR FROZEN
PRECIPITATION NEAR THE TENNESSEE/MISSISSIPPI BORDER. BUT THINK
PRECIP SHOULD SHUT OFF BEFORE TEMPERATURES GET COLD ENOUGH TO
SUPPORT SNOW. BUT THIS WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED.

THIS SECONDARY LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE EAST AND HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN. EXPECT DRY AND COOL WEATHER THROUGH
TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE INDICATING ANOTHER
FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN. MUCH COLDER
AIR WILL FILTER SOUTH FOR THE END OF THE WEEK...WITH TEMPERATURES
MUCH BELOW NORMAL. THE MODELS CONTINUING TO FLIP FLOP BETWEEN DRY
AND POSSIBLE WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS. AT THIS POINT...WILL LEAVE
EXTENDED DRY UNTIL MODELS COME INTO SOME KIND OF AGREEMENT ON THE
EXTENDED WEATHER SITUATION.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
1123 AM CST SAT DEC 3 2005

.UPDATE...

LOOKS LIKE AN ACTIVE WEATHER EVENING ON TAP FOR THE MID-SOUTH.
LOTS OF THINGS TO LOOK AT THIS MORNING AND ALL POINTING TOWARDS
THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE WEATHER...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 00Z. 

AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE LOCATED THIS MORNING OVER EASTERN
OKLAHOMA WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST THROUGH THE DAY. A WARM FRONT
EXTENDING EAST FROM THE LOW...CURRENTLY STRETCHED ACROSS CENTRAL
ARKANSAS INTO NORTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH. AREAS SOUTH OF THE FRONT HAVE SEEN
A DRAMATIC INCREASE IN DEWPOINTS...WITH LOW 60S DEWPOINTS AS FAR
NORTH NOW AS GREENVILLE MISSISSIPPI. THESE HIGH DEWPOINTS AND
BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER ARE EXPECTED TO REACH INTO FAR SOUTHERN
TENNESSEE BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD ALLOW THE ATMOSPHERE
TO BECOME INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE
AREA AND SET THE STAGE FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT AFTER 00Z AS
SURFACE LOW MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. EXPECT DEVELOPMENT IN VICINITY
OF THE LOW AND ALONG SLOWING WARM FRONT FIRST THEN DEVELOPING
LATER ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES THROUGH NORTH MISSISSIPPI.
SEVERE POTENTIAL WILL INCREASE AFTER 00Z AS WELL...WITH STRONG
WIND FIELDS...HIGH HELICITY VALUES...AND STEEPENING LAPSE RATES.
POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND A FEW
TORNADOES...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AFTER DARK
WITH ANY SURFACE BASED CONVECTION THAT CAN DEVELOP. JUST NORTH OF
THE WARM FRONT ELEVATED SEVERE WITH A LARGE HAIL POTENTIAL WILL BE
POSSIBLE OVER WEST TENNESSEE WITH ROTATING STORMS ROOTED ABOVE
STABLE LAYER.

BACK TO TODAY...FARTHER EAST ACROSS EASTERN AND NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF
THE MID-SOUTH...BEST ISENTROPIC FORCING OF MOISTURE STARTING TO
SHIFT EAST INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND ALABAMA. THINK THAT LESS
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS
FROM WEST TO EAST...AS ELEVATED MIXED LAYER NOTED ON MORNING
SOUNDINGS TO OUR SOUTHWEST OVERSPREADS THE AREA AND CAPS THE
ATMOSPHERE UNTIL AFTER 00Z WITH AFORMENTIONED SYSTEM. 

SO HAVE MADE CHANGES MAINLY WITH REDUCING POPS FROM WEST TO EAST
FOR TODAY. UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONES OUT MOMENTARILY.

.DISCUSSION...

A LOW NOW OVER OK WILL MOVE TO THE MIDSOUTH BY THIS EVENING.
RAIN WILL CONTINUE THIS MORNING DUE MOISTURE COMING UP OVER A
WARM FRONT POSITIONED FROM OKC TO MOB. EVENTUALLY...COUNTIES TO
THE SOUTH OF I 40 SHOULD GET INTO THE WARM SECTOR. WHEN THIS
HAPPENS...SHEAR WILL BECOME STRONG ALONG WITH MORE MOISTURE AND
STEEPER LAPSE RATES TO BRING STRONG TO SEVERE HAIL AND WINDSTORMS
AND POSSIBLY A TORNADO. NORTH OF I 40...HAIL STORMS COULD DEVELOP
LATER TODAY.

THE LOW SHOULD BE IN WV BY SUN MORNING WHILE THE TRAILING COLD
FRONT SLOWS IN CENTRAL MS. THE SOUTH HALF OF THE CWA WILL
CONTINUE TO GET SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BUT THE NORTH HALF
SHOULD BE DRY SUNDAY.

THE FRONT WILL MOVE ON TO THE COAST BY SUN EVENING...BUT WAVES
MOVING ALONG THE FRONT WILL PROVIDE A CONTINUED CHANCE FOR
TRW/SHW IN THE S HALF OF OUR AREA.

MONDAY...RAIN WILL BE CONFINED TO THE SOUTHEASTERN THIRD OF THE
CWA MONDAY MORNING. RAIN SHOULD BE OUT OF THE MIDSOUTH BY NOON
MONDAY.

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY SHOULD BE DRY AND COOL.

.DISCUSSION...
SOME CLOUDS BEGINNING TO MOVE INTO CENTRAL AND WESTERN ARKANSAS AND
EVENTUALLY INTO THE FORECAST AREA. NO RAIN IN SIGHT AT THIS POINT
AND IT SHOULD BE WELL AFTER MIDNIGHT BEFORE WE SEE ANY RAIN.
TEMPERATURES ARE GETTING CLOSE TO THE FORECAST LOWS BUT WITH CLOUDS
COMING IN THEY SHOULD NOT DROP TO MUCH LOWER. CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS
FINE FOR NOW SO NO CHANGES ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS SITUATED OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS
AFTERNOON AND THIS HAS PROVIDED FOR A MOSTLY SUNNY AFTERNOON WITH
COOL TEMPERATURES. THIS HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE MOVING EAST
AND WILL ALLOW FOR A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE
WEEKEND.

A LOW AMPLITUDE SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING OUT OF THE INTERMOUNTAIN
WEST THIS AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST IN THE INCREASINGLY
FASTER ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. THIS HAS INDUCED THE DEVELOPMENT OF A
WEAK SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES...CENTERED
OVER WESTERN KANSAS. LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW HAS DEVELOPED THIS
AFTERNOON IN ADVANCE OF THIS SYSTEM ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND
THIS ALSO IS REFLECTED BY THE INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL CLOUDS ACROSS
EASTERN TEXAS. ADVECTION OF THIS MOISTER AIRMASS SHOULD CONTINUE
OVERNIGHT AND BEGIN TO SPREAD NORTH AND EAST TOWARDS THE MID-
SOUTH ON SATURDAY BEHIND A DEVELOPING WARM FRONT THAT WILL EXTEND
EAST ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LATER TONIGHT. EXPECT
RAIN TO DEVELOP AFTER MIDNIGHT AHEAD OF THE DEVELOPING WARM
FRONT...AS INCREASING MOISTURE IS ISENTROPICALLY LIFTED OVER THE
DEVELOPING BOUNDARY. CHANCES FOR RAIN AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING.

THE SURFACE WARM FRONT SHOULD PROGRESS ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI BY
SATURDAY AFTERNOON BEFORE STALLING IN THE VICINITY OF INTERSTATE
40. LATER SATURDAY EVENING...THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE
ALONG THE STALLED BOUNDARY. TO THE SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT (MAINLY
ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI)...THE AIRMASS SHOULD BECOME INCREASINGLY
UNSTABLE...WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS APPROACHING OR EXCEEDING 60
DEGREES. IN ADDITION...850-500 MB MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES BECOME
STEEP BETWEEN 6.5 AND 7.0 C/KM IN ADVANCE OF THE SURFACE
LOW...OVER THE WARM SECTOR AND JUST ALONG AND TO THE NORTH OF THE
BAROCLINIC BOUNDARY. ALSO...WIND SPEEDS THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERE
WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN...WITH A LOW LEVEL JET PROGGED TO
INCREASE BETWEEN 50-60 KTS AND MID LEVEL WINDS BETWEEN 60-70 KTS.
IN ADDITION...0-1 KM HELICITIES WILL BE IN EXCESS OF 250 M2/S2
OVER THE WARM SECTOR. THE PRIMARY QUESTION WITH RESPECT TO
TOMORROW WILL BE HOW MUCH OF THE WARM SECTOR GETS INTO OUR AREA.
THERE IS STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY IN HOW FAR NORTH THE WARM FRONT
REACHES...BUT AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT AT LEAST SOUTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL GET INTO THE WARM SECTOR.
ANOTHER LIMITING FACTOR MAY BE THAT THE SYSTEM HAS SLOWED A BIT
AND THE BEST FORCING WILL BE AFTER 00Z...SO WE WILL LOOSE DAYTIME
HEATING. YET...MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE SUCH...IN ASSOCIATION
WITH THE 500 MB COLD CORE (500 MB TEMPS BETWEEN -14 AND -16
DEGREES)...SHOULD HELP KEEP DECENT MLCAPES EVEN AFTER DARK. SO
THERE SHOULD BE THE THREAT OF SOME SURFACE BASED CONVECTION...SOME
OF WHICH COULD BECOME SEVERE WITH LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING
WINDS...AND AN ISOLATED TORNADO...ACROSS THE WARM SECTOR. FURTHER
NORTH...ACROSS EAST ARKANSAS AND WEST TENNESSEE...THE CONVECTION
SHOULD REMAIN ELEVATED. BUT WITH SUCH STEEP LAPSE RATES...CANNOT
RULE OUT LARGE HAIL POSSIBILITIES WITH ROTATING STORMS ROOTED
ABOVE THE BOUNDARY LAYER. SPC HAS PLACED THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE
AREA IN SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT.

THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD LIFT NORTHEAST AND DRAG THE FRONT
SLOWLY SOUTH INTO NORTH MISSISSIPPI ON SUNDAY. ANOTHER MORE
AMPLIFIED SHORTWAVE WILL APPROACH THE MID-SOUTH AND ALLOW FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF A SECONDARY MORE POTENT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TO
DEVELOP LATER SUNDAY ALONG THE BAROCLINIC ZONE TO OUR SOUTH. THIS
LOW WILL MOVE EAST AND SHOULD ALLOW FOR RAIN TO REDEVELOP OVER THE
AREA TO THE NORTH OF THIS SYSTEM. ELEVATED ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER PORTIONS OF NORTH MISSISSIPPI LATER SUNDAY
AND SUNDAY NIGHT. AS THIS SYSTEM IS DEVELOPING...COLDER AIR WILL
CONTINUE FILTERING SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.
MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED AREAWIDE DURING THIS TIME
PERIOD. ENOUGH COLD AIR MAY FILTER INTO NORTHERN SECTIONS SUNDAY
NIGHT TO ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF THE PRECIPITATION MIXING
WITH OR CHANGING TO SNOW. ALTHOUGH AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT BY
THE TIME ENOUGH COLD AIR FILTERS IN...PRECIPITATION WILL BE LIGHT.
SO NO MAJOR PROBLEMS EXPECTED AT THIS TIME...BUT WILL NEED TO KEEP
AN EYE ON THE SITUATION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

ONCE THIS SECONDARY SHORTWAVE SWINGS THROUGH...PRECIPITATION
SHOULD COME TO AN END MONDAY MORNING. COLD CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE
WILL SETTLE OVER THE MID-SOUTH...WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES
AND DRY WEATHER EXPECTED THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING. 12Z MEDIUM
RANGE MODELS ARE STILL HINTING AT AN ARCTIC AIRMASS FILTERING
SOUTH INTO THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...AS A POTENT
UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE DIVES SOUTH ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES. 12Z
RUNS OF BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE INDICATING A SURFACE LOW
DEVELOPING OVER THE GULF AND MOVING NORTHEAST...POSSIBLY SPREADING
PRECIPITATION OVER THE COLD AIRMASS. BECAUSE OF THIS HAVE
INTRODUCED A CHANCE OF RAIN OR SNOW OVER THE AREA FOR THURSDAY AND
THURSDAY NIGHT. THERE HAS BEEN SOME MODEL INCONSISTANCY BETWEEN
THE 00Z AND 12Z RUNS...SO PLENTY OF TIME TO WATCH THIS SYSTEM.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE OVER THE MID-SOUTH TODAY WITH MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES AND ONLY SOME HIGH THIN CIRRUS MOVING THROUGH THE AREA.
TEMPERATURES REMAIN ON THE CHILLY SIDE THIS MORNING...WITH 16Z
READINGS RANGING FROM THE UPPER 20S NORTH TO UPPER 30S SOUTH.
THINK THAT AS SOME WARM ADVECTION BEGINS OVER THE AREA THAT
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABLE TO REBOUND TO CURRENTLY FORECAST HIGHS

REMAIN A COOL AFTERNOON...WITH FAIRLY LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS.

CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS ARE ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO GET VERY
COLD OVERNIGHT. LOWS COULD REACH 20 AT PARIS TN AND 30 AT
ABERDEEN MS. THE AIR MASS BRINGING THIS COLD WEATHER WILL SLIP ON
EAST TDA. AS A RESULT WINDS WILL VEER TO THE SOUTHEAST BY THIS
AFTERNOON. THE NET RESULT OF ALL THIS IS THAT THERE WILL BE LOTS
OF SUNSHINE TDA WHILE TEMPS RISE TO THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S.

THE HIGH WILL BE OVER THE EASTERN STATES BY SATURDAY MORNING AND
A LOW WILL HAVE MOVED INTO OK. A WARM FRONT WILL HAVE DEVELOPED
SOUTHWEST OF OUR AREA THRU THE NIGHT. MOISTURE WILL LIKELY COME
UP OVER THE MIDSOUTH AND BRING SOME LIGHT RAIN BY DAYBREAK.

SATURDAY THE LOW GETS OVER MEMPHIS. MOST OF THE AREA WILL GET
RAIN...BUT COUNTIES SOUTH OF I 40 COULD HAVE HAIL AND WIND STORMS
ACCORDING TO THE GFS. CONDITIONS WILL BE BEST FOR SEVERE WEATHER
IN NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE GREATEST.

SATURDAYS LOW WILL MOVE ON EAST AND LET A FRONT SWEEP SOUTH
THROUGH THE AREA OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL DIMINISH PCPN CHANCES FROM
THE NORTH AND SEVERE WEATHER WILL COME TO A HALT SATURDAY
EVENING.

OVERRUNNING RAIN WILL REDEVELOP SUNDAY AS AN UPPER TROUGH DIGS
INTO THE PLAINS. THUNDERSTORMS COULD OCCUR IN SOUTHEASTERN
COUNTIES DURING THE DAY. OVERRUNNING WILL CONTINUE SUNDAY NIGHT
AS THE UPPER TROUGH SHARPENS AND MOVES TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH. THINK
PCPN WILL BE LIQUID SUN NIGHT.

MONDAY WILL BE MAINLY DRY AND COOLER AS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS
MOVES ON EAST OF US. DRY WEATHER SHOULD BE THE RULE THEN ON
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. AFTER THAT...ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH COULD
GO THROUGH THE MIDWEST AND BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF RAIN.

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 402 PM CST THU DEC 1 2005) 

DISCUSSION...

THE SHORT TERM FORECAST REMAINS STRAIGHT-FORWARD THIS AFTERNOON
BUT THE MIDDLE AND LATTER PORTION OF THE FORECAST IS RATHER COMPLEX. 
IN THE SHORT TERM...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED OVER THE
MID-SOUTH WITH NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. EXPECT THIS HIGH PRESSURE
SYSTEM TO SLIDE EAST THROUGH FRIDAY...PROVIDING FOR DRY WEATHER
AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. 

THE FORECAST BECOMES MORE COMPLEX AS WE GET INTO THE WEEKEND AND
INTO NEXT WEEK. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD BE LOCATED TO THE
EAST OF THE AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW
BECOMING ZONAL. A SHORTWAVE IMPULSE NOW PUSHING ONSHORE ACROSS THE
WEST COAST WILL TRANSLATE EASTWARD IN THE ZONAL FLOW AND HELP TO
DEVELOP A WEAK SURFACE LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES ON
FRIDAY. THIS WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE EAST TOWARDS THE MID-
SOUTH FRIDAY NIGHT AND ACROSS THE AREA ON SATURDAY. AS THIS LOW
PRESSURE APPROACHES FRIDAY NIGHT...THE LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD TURN
INCREASINGLY SOUTHERLY...WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEGINNING TO
RETURN NORTHWARD. CURRENTLY FAVORING THE NAM SOLUTION OVER THE GFS
WITH RESPECT TO THE OVERALL TRACK OF THE LOW. PREFER AT THIS TIME
THE LESS AMPLIFIED SOLUTION PROVIDED BY THE NAM. ALSO...AM A BIT
CONCERNED ABOUT THE QUICKNESS OF BOTH THE MODELS IN RETURNING 60
DEGREE DEWPOINTS SO FAR NORTH ON SATURDAY...WITH NO DEEP
AMPLIFICATION OF THE UPPER FLOW AND THE DEEP ENTRUSION OF DRY AND
COLD AIRMASS INTO THE SOUTH TODAY. SO WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON
HOW FAR NORTH MODIFIED GULF AIRMASS RETURNS ON SATURDAY AND WHERE
THE BAROCLINIC ZONE SETS UP. THIS WILL BE WHERE THE SURFACE LOW
TRACKS AS IT MOVES EASTWARD ALONG THE STALLED FRONT ON SATURDAY
INTO SATURDAY NIGHT. AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS THAT THE BOUNDARY
WILL MAKE IT INTO NORTH MISSISSIPPI BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON.
PRECEDING THIS BOUNDARY FRIDAY NIGHT...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD
RETURN NORTH...ISENTROPICALLY LIFTED OVER THE ADVANCING WARM
FRONT. THIS IS BEST REFLECTED ON THE 295K PRESSURE SURFACE WITH
DEEPER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEING LIFTED OVER THE FRONT. THIS SHOULD
MEAN THAT RAIN AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP LATER
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SPREAD FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. 

BY SATURDAY...THE WARM FRONT SHOULD STALL ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTH
MISSISSIPPI WITH THE WEAK LOW MOVING EAST ALONG THE BOUNDARY. AREAS
SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY SHOULD GET INTO THE WARM SECTOR...MAINLY
ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. MODELS (INCLUDING THE PREFERED NAM) ARE
INDICATING THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMING UNSTABLE OVER THESE AREAS. WITH
STRONG DEEP LAYER FLOW CUTTING ACROSS THE WARM SECTOR...THE
PRESENCE OF THE SURFACE BOUNDARY...AND SOME LARGE SCALE FORCING
ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 110+ KNOT UPPER
JET...THERE MAY BE SOME SURFACE BASED CONVECTION AND THE
POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE WEATHER IN THESE AREAS. AGAIN THE GREATEST
THREAT WILL BE ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI...MAINLY
SOUTHEAST OF THE TUPELO AREA. AREAS FURTHER NORTH...ALONG AND JUST
NORTH OF THE FRONT WILL HAVE THE POSSIBILITY FOR ELEVATED
CONVECTION...WITH POSSIBLY SOME HAIL REPORTS. THE EXTENT OF THE
SEVERE THREAT WILL REMAIN HINGED UPON THE EVENTUAL LOW
TRACK AND AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY/OVERALL SIZE OF WARM SECTOR. THERE
MAY BE LOW CLOUDS OVER THE DEVELOPING WARM SECTOR WHICH WOULD CUT
DOWN ON SEVERE THREAT. BUT THERE IS CURRENTLY SOME SEVERE THREAT
FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND WILL NEED TO BE CLOSELY
WATCHED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. CONFIDENCE IS STILL RATHER
LOW WITH THE EXPECTED SURFACE LOW TRACK AS MODELS REMAIN SOMEWHAT DIVERGENT.

AFTER THE FIRST LOW PRESSURE PASSES BY SATURDAY NIGHT...THE FRONT
SHOULD SLOWLY SAG SOUTH WITH COOLER AIR FILTERING INTO THE REGION.
A SECONDARY SHORTWAVE IMPULSE WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE
PLAINS STATES SATURDAY NIGHT AND TOWARDS THE AREA SUNDAY. THIS
WILL HELP INDUCE THE DEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER LOW THAT WILL TRACK
FURTHER SOUTH. THIS WILL STILL SPREAD MOISTURE AND RAIN CHANCES
ACROSS THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. COLDER AIR WILL
CONTINUE FILTERING SOUTH INTO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA SUNDAY
INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY THAT ENOUGH COLD AIR
WILL FILTER SOUTH INTO NORTHERN TIER AREAS TO CHANGE THE LIGHT
RAIN TO LIGHT SNOW. ANY FROZEN PRECIP SHOULD BE LIGHT AND CHANCES
LOW...SO DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A BIG DEAL AT THIS POINT.

STRONG CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN BY MONDAY AND THE
FRONT SHOULD SWEEP SOUTHEAST...BRINGING AN END TO ANY PRECIP BY
MONDAY MORNING. THEN COLDER AND DRY AIR WILL FILTER IN FOR TUESDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY...WITH STRONG SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVERHEAD.
THERE WILL BE ANOTHER STRONG SHORTWAVE THAT WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST
TOWARDS THE AREA BEYOND THIS EXTENDED PERIOD THAT WILL NEED TO BE
CLOSELY WATCHED. MORE PRECIP WILL BE POSSIBLE BY THE END OF THE
WEEK...AND WITH RETREATING MODIFIED ARCTIC AIRMASS STILL IN
PLACE...SOME FROZEN PRECIP IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. BUT STILL
WELL INTO THE EXTENDED WITH PLENTY OF TIME FOR CHANGES IN THE
PATTERN. SO NOT LIKELY...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR WITH PLENTY
OF TIME TO WATCH.

.UPDATE...

THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING IS NOW
TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA. SKIES HAVE CLEARED NICELY
ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION AND SHOULD REMAIN SO ACROSS MOST AREAS
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. THE ONLY EXCEPTION WILL BE ACROSS NORTHEAST
SECTIONS (PORTIONS OF NORTHWEST TENNESSEE) WHERE CO-LOCATION TO THE
COLDEST TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL ALLOW FOR SOME REDEVELOPMENT OF A
CU FIELD. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD TEND TO DIMINISH LATER THIS
AFTERNOON. SO THEREFORE...UPDATED THE CLOUD GRIDS TO REFLECT THESE CHANGES.

DECENT LOW LEVEL COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA
THIS AFTERNOON BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE
TO WARM MUCH FROM CURRENT READINGS...SO HAVE DROPPED TEMPERATURE
FORECAST A FEW DEGREES...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER OF
THE FORECAST AREA...WHERE COLD ADVECTION IS STRONGEST. TEMPERATURE
GRIDS ALSO REFLECT THESE CHANGES.

OTHERWISE...THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST LOOKS IN GOOD SHAPE. SO

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 315 AM CST THU DEC 1 2005) 

DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER SHORTWAVE WITH AN ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONT IS MOVING
ACROSS ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. KNQA AND KLZK ARE BOTH SHOWING A FEW
RETURNS. MUCH OF THESE RETURNS ARE EMANATING FROM MID CLOUD WITH
ONLY A FEW SPRINKLES IS REACHING THE GROUND. THERE IS A BATCH OF
STRONGER RETURNS MOVING FROM LITTLE ROCK TOWARDS CLARKSDALE WHERE
THE RAIN MAY BE MORE MEASURABLE. OBSERVATIONS FROM LITTLE ROCK
HAVE CONFIRMED THIS. HAVE INCLUDED ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS
FROM CLARKSDALE TO TUPELO THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF THIS.
OTHERWISE...FORECAST MAINLY ON TRACK. CLOUD COVER IS A LITTLE MORE
EXTENSIVE THAN PLANNED BUT CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE OUT OF THE
REGION BY AFTERNOON. WILL LEAN TOWARDS GUIDANCE ON HIGH TEMPS
TODAY DESPITE YESTERDAYS PERFORMANCE. BELIEVE THE PROBLEM
YESTERDAY MAY BE DUE TO THE TEMPERATURES STARTING OUT COLDER THAN
MODELS EXPECTED. THIS IS NOT THE CASE THIS MORNING.

HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD PROVIDE MAINLY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT AND FOR
MUCH OF THE DAY ON FRIDAY. EXCELLENT RADIATING CONDITIONS
TONIGHT...WOULDNT BE SURPRISED TO SEE A FEW TEEN READINGS OUT OF
SOME OF THE COLDER SPOTS OF WESTERN TENNESSEE AND EXTREME NORTH
MISSISSIPPI. HAVE UNDERCUT GUIDANCE HIGHS FOR FRIDAY. EXPECT THAT
A SIMILAR SITUATION TO YESTERDAY WHERE TEMPS IN THE MORNING START
OUT A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE MODELS EXPECT AND SO AFTERNOON HIGHS
ARENT AS WARM. CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO STREAM NORTHWARD LATE
TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND TOMORROW EVENING IN ADVANCE OF A WARM FRONT
MOVING OUT OF THE SOUTH. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW OVERRUNNING LIGHT
RAIN BREAKING OUT ACROSS THE REGION TOMORROW NIGHT AS
BAROCLINICITY INCREASES. 

THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS BUT JUST
ENOUGH TO CREATE SERIOUS FORECAST ISSUES. THE NAM IS FURTHER SOUTH
THAN THE GFS WITH THE TRACK OF A SURFACE LOW THAT IS EXPECTED TO
DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. BOTH MODELS STALL THE WARM FRONT
ROUGHLY ALONG I 40. THE GFS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN THAT THE LOW
RUNS RIGHT UP THE FRONT WHEREAS THE NAM IS FURTHER SOUTH BECAUSE
ITS SOLUTION IS FASTER WITH THE 850MB FLOW AND FEELS THE EFFECTS

EXCELLENT CONSISTENCY ON ITS 00Z RUNS OVER THE PAST FEW NIGHTS
WHEREAS THIS IS REALLY JUST THE FIRST RUN OF THE NAM. AS A
RESULT...THERE SHOULD BE A NOTICEABLE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN JONESBORO (IN THE COLD SECTOR) AND TUPELO (IN THE WARM
SECTOR). ALONG THE FRONT...FOR MEMPHIS AND JACKSON THE TEMPERATURE
FORECAST COULD EASILY BUST BY 5 TO 10 DEGREES DEPENDING UPON JUST
WHERE THE FRONT SETS UP. GFS CONTINUES TO ADVERTISE AN UNSTABLE
SITUATION DEVELOPING IN THE WARM SECTOR LATE SATURDAY AND SATURDAY
EVENING AS THE LOW MOVES THROUGH THE REGION AND DRAGS A COLD FRONT
THROUGH NORTH MISSISSIPPI. GFS INSTABILITY IS AROUND -2 WITH CAPES
OF ABOUT 500-800J/KG AND MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AROUND 7 C/KM. THE
GFS SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF CLOUD COVER WHICH MAY LIMIT THE
INSTABILITY. ALTHOUGH IF CONVECTION WERE TO DEVELOP THERE WOULD BE
A SEVERE THREAT WITH HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS AS THE PRIMARY
THREAT. AN ISOLATED TORNADO IS POSSIBLE AS WELL. 

THE FRONT WILL LINGER JUST SOUTH OF THE REGION ON SUNDAY BEFORE AN
UPPER SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH THE REGION KICKING THE SYSTEM AWAY
FROM THE AREA. CLOUD COVER AND CHANCES OF RAIN WILL CONTINUE INTO
SUNDAY EVENING UNTIL THE UPPER SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH. THERE IS
A SLIM CHANCE OF A WET SNOWFLAKE SUNDAY EVENING WITH GFS SHOWING
THE THERMAL PROFILE BELOW FREEZING JUST AS THE MOISTURE IS
LEAVING. 

GFS IS MUCH COLDER THAN YESTERDAYS RUN FOR NEXT WEEK WITH 850
TEMPS FALLING AS LOW AS -10 OVER JONESBORO. THE EUROPEAN DOES
SUPPORT THIS COLDER TREND BUT NOT QUITE AS COLD...ABOUT 3 DEGREES

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
315 AM CST THU DEC 1 2005

.DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER SHORTWAVE WITH AN ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONT IS MOVING
ACROSS ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. KNQA AND KLZK ARE BOTH SHOWING A FEW
RETURNS. MUCH OF THESE RETURNS ARE EMANATING FROM MID CLOUD WITH
ONLY A FEW SPRINKLES IS REACHING THE GROUND. THERE IS A BATCH OF
STRONGER RETURNS MOVING FROM LITTLE ROCK TOWARDS CLARKSDALE WHERE
THE RAIN MAY BE MORE MEASURABLE. OBSERVATIONS FROM LITTLE ROCK
HAVE CONFIRMED THIS. HAVE INCLUDED ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS
FROM CLARKSDALE TO TUPELO THIS MORNING BECAUSE OF THIS.
OTHERWISE...FORECAST MAINLY ON TRACK. CLOUD COVER IS A LITTLE MORE
EXTENSIVE THAN PLANNED BUT CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE OUT OF THE
REGION BY AFTERNOON. WILL LEAN TOWARDS GUIDANCE ON HIGH TEMPS
TODAY DESPITE YESTERDAYS PERFORMANCE. BELIEVE THE PROBLEM
YESTERDAY MAY BE DUE TO THE TEMPERATURES STARTING OUT COLDER THAN
MODELS EXPECTED. THIS IS NOT THE CASE THIS MORNING.

HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD PROVIDE MAINLY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT AND FOR
MUCH OF THE DAY ON FRIDAY. EXCELLENT RADIATING CONDITIONS
TONIGHT...WOULDNT BE SURPRISED TO SEE A FEW TEEN READINGS OUT OF
SOME OF THE COLDER SPOTS OF WESTERN TENNESSEE AND EXTREME NORTH
MISSISSIPPI. HAVE UNDERCUT GUIDANCE HIGHS FOR FRIDAY. EXPECT THAT
A SIMILAR SITUATION TO YESTERDAY WHERE TEMPS IN THE MORNING START
OUT A LITTLE LOWER THAN THE MODELS EXPECT AND SO AFTERNOON HIGHS
ARENT AS WARM. CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO STREAM NORTHWARD LATE
TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND TOMORROW EVENING IN ADVANCE OF A WARM FRONT
MOVING OUT OF THE SOUTH. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW OVERRUNNING LIGHT
RAIN BREAKING OUT ACROSS THE REGION TOMORROW NIGHT AS
BAROCLINICITY INCREASES. 

THERE IS NOT MUCH DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS BUT JUST
ENOUGH TO CREATE SERIOUS FORECAST ISSUES. THE NAM IS FURTHER SOUTH
THAN THE GFS WITH THE TRACK OF A SURFACE LOW THAT IS EXPECTED TO
DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. BOTH MODELS STALL THE WARM FRONT
ROUGHLY ALONG I 40. THE GFS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN THAT THE LOW
RUNS RIGHT UP THE FRONT WHEREAS THE NAM IS FURTHER SOUTH BECAUSE
ITS SOLUTION IS FASTER WITH THE 850MB FLOW AND FEELS THE EFFECTS
OF IT. WILL CONTINUE TO SIDE WITH THE GFS SOLUTION BASED UPON
EXCELLENT CONSISTENCY ON ITS 00Z RUNS OVER THE PAST FEW NIGHTS
WHEREAS THIS IS REALLY JUST THE FIRST RUN OF THE NAM. AS A
RESULT...THERE SHOULD BE A NOTICEABLE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE
BETWEEN JONESBORO (IN THE COLD SECTOR) AND TUPELO (IN THE WARM
SECTOR). ALONG THE FRONT...FOR MEMPHIS AND JACKSON THE TEMPERATURE
FORECAST COULD EASILY BUST BY 5 TO 10 DEGREES DEPENDING UPON JUST

OF ABOUT 500-800J/KG AND MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AROUND 7 C/KM. THE

SUNDAY EVENING UNTIL THE UPPER SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH. THERE IS
A SLIM CHANCE OF A WET SNOWFLAKE SUNDAY EVENING WITH GFS SHOWING
THE THERMAL PROFILE BELOW FREEZING JUST AS THE MOISTURE IS
LEAVING. 

GFS IS MUCH COLDER THAN YESTERDAYS RUN FOR NEXT WEEK WITH 850
TEMPS FALLING AS LOW AS -10 OVER JONESBORO. THE EUROPEAN DOES
SUPPORT THIS COLDER TREND BUT NOT QUITE AS COLD...ABOUT 3 DEGREES
WARMER AT 850. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT TEMPS NEXT WEEK SHOULD BE WELL
BELOW NORMAL AS AN UPPER TROUGH DIGS INTO THE CENTRAL U.S.

.UPDATE...

TEMPS FALLING QUICKLY IN ADVANCE OF HIGH CLOUDS MOVING RAPIDLY ACRS
ARKANSAS. EASTERN LOCATIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WL CONT TO HAVE
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDS FOR NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. WL DO A
QUICK UPDATE TO LOWER TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES ACRS THE TN RIVER
VALLEY. ELSEWHERE TEMPS LOOK GOOD...CLOUDS MOVING IN WILL SLOW
THE FALL.

&&

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 303 PM CST WED NOV 30 2005) 

DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER CWA...WITH CLEAR SKIES AND
TEMPERATURES MAINLY IN THE 40S. DEWPOINTS IN THE 20S AND LIGHT
WINDS. 

SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
SHORT TERM PORTION IS THE EASY PORTION OF THE FORECAST. SURFACE
HIGH BEGINS TO MOVE OFF TO THE EAST TONIGHT...WITH RETURN FLOW
SETTING UP. SINCE DEWPOINTS ARE BELOW FREEZING THE WHOLE WAY TO
THE GULF COAST...GOING TO BE QUITE A WHILE BEFORE WE MOISTEN UP.
SHORTWAVE PASSES BY US TO THE NORTH TONIGHT...AND DONT EXPECT
MUCH MORE THAN SOME HIGH CLOUDS...IF THAT MUCH.

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WILL BE DRY AS NEXT SURFACE HIGH TRANSLATES
EASTWARD ACROSS US. TEMPERATURES TONIGHT PROBABLY A COUPLE DEGREES
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY IN MOST AREAS...AND A FEW DEGREES HIGHER
THAN THAT ON FRIDAY MORNING. HIGHS NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE THOSE
SEEN TODAY IN MOST AREAS. NEXT IMPULSE KICKS OUT OF ROCKIES
FRIDAY NIGHT. MODELS INDICATE ISENTROPIC LIFT IS AVAILABLE...BUT
IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE LOWER LAYERS TO MOISTEN UP. MAY NOT
HAVE MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION REACH THE SURFACE BY 12Z
SATURDAY...AND WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS. 

LONG TERM (SATURDAY AND BEYOND)...
REAL FORECAST FUN IS IN THE LONG TERM. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE LAST
WEEK OR SO...THERE HAS BEEN VERY POOR CONTINUITY IN SOLUTIONS
BETWEEN THE MODELS...AND POOR RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY WITHIN THE
GFS. NEEDLESS TO SAY...CONFIDENCE IN EXTENDED FORECAST PERIOD IS
BELOW NORMAL.

BOUNDARY FROM FRIDAYS SYSTEM HANGS NEAR OR JUST SOUTH OF THE CWA
SATURDAY MORNING. AS SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNS AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT...WARM
SECTOR WILL LIFT INTO OR VERY CLOSE TO THE CWA SATURDAY AFTERNOON
AND EVENING. MODELS SHOW ENOUGH INSTABILITY IN WARM SECTOR FOR
POTENTIAL THUNDERSTORMS. PARAMETERS FOR SEVERE WEATHER NOT PARTICULARLY
STRONG ON THIS RUN. WILL USE INTERSTATE 40 FOR A DIVIDING LINE FOR
CONVECTION/NO CONVECTION SATURDAY AFTERNOON. WITH UNCERTAINTY ON
FRONTAL POSITION AND MOISTURE AVAILABILITY...POPS WILL REMAIN IN
CHANCE RANGE FOR NOW. SATURDAY TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMEST OF THE
WEEK. BOTH GFS AND NAM SHOW 850 TEMPS AROUND +10 ON SATURDAY.
SO...DEPENDING ON LOCATION OF WARM FRONT...AND CLOUD COVER...WE
COULD BE ANYWHERE FROM LOWER 60S TO LOWER 70S ON HIGHS. WILL GO
MIDDLE OF THE COURSE FOR NOW.

MODELS FORECAST FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH ON SUNDAY...AND HANG UP TO
THE SOUTH OF THE AREA BY MONDAY MORNING. POPS WILL TAPER OFF
SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.

DETAILS EXTREMELY MURKY AFTER MONDAY MORNING. GFS 12Z RUN A LARGE
DEPARTURE FROM PREVIOUS RUNS...PHASING 3 STREAMS AND BRINGING THE
CORE OF THE POLAR AIR INTO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY TUESDAY
AND WEDNESDAY. GFS TAKES 85O TEMPS FROM +10 ON SUNDAY MORNING...TO
-20 () BY TUESDAY EVENING. WHILE 06Z DGEX AND 12Z ECMWF DO SHOW
COLDER WEATHER...NO INDICATIONS OF ALL STREAMS PHASING ON EITHER
MODEL. CONSIDERING POOR MODEL CONTINUITY MENTIONED ABOVE...WILL
COOL FORECAST FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY A FEW DEGREES BELOW
CURRENT FORECAST. FORECAST WILL REMAIN DRY FOR THOSE PERIODS.

IF GFS WERE TO DEVELOP CONTINUITY FROM RUN TO RUN WITH THIS
SOLUTION...LATER FORECASTS WOULD NEED TO BE COOLED
SIGNIFICANTLY...SO STAY TUNED. 12Z GFS SOLUTION WOULD DICTATE
TEMPERATURES BELOW FREEZING ALL DAY TUESDAY.

HIGH PRESSURE IS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED OVER THE REGION THIS MORNING.
CLEAR SKIES WITH LIGHT WINDS AND LOW DEW POINTS HAVE RESULTED IN
MANY LOCATIONS REPORTING TEMPS IN THE 20S. HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE MAINLY SUNNY CONDITIONS TODAY AND GUIDANCE
SEEMS UNIFORM AND REASONABLE ON HIGHS FOR TODAY. TONIGHT A WEAK
SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION.
GFS/NAM CONTINUE TO SHOW DRY LOW LEVELS IN PLACE WITH LITTLE
MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THUS NO RAIN IS EXPECTED. HAVE
EVEN BACKED OFF OF CLOUD COVER WITH GFS/NAM SHOWING SIGNIFICANT
850MB MOISTURE MAKING IT ONLY AS FAR NORTH AS PERHAPS CLARKSDALE
TO COLUMBUS. A REINFORCING SHOT OF COOL DRY AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE
REGION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. 

FRIDAY NIGHT...GFS/NAM SHOW A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. A WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTHWARD INTO THE
MIDSOUTH DURING THE NIGHT. THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH MOISTURE RETURN
WITH THE FRONT FOR AREAS OF OVERRUNNING RAINFALL ACROSS THE REGION
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. HIGHS WILL BE NOTICEABLY WARMER ON
SATURDAY AS THE MODES SHOW MOST OF THE REGION UNDER THE INFLUENCE
OF THE WARM SECTOR OF THE SYSTEM WITH 850MB TEMPS ABOVE +10. THE
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE REGION LATE IN THE
DAY ON SATURDAY OR DURING THE EVENING. THIS WILL DRAG A STRONG
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW. GFS
SHOWS ENOUGH SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY WITH LIS AROUND -2 TO
WARRANT THUNDER. MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES LOOK IMPRESSIVE AS WELL
(7 C/KM). SEVERE POTENTIAL AS IS OFTEN THE CASE THIS TIME OF YEAR
WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON HOW MUCH INSTABILITY IS IN PLACE. AND THAT
IS REALLY NOT KNOWN FOR SURE AT THIS TIME. THE FRONT SHOULD CLEAR
THE REGION BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH COLD AIR ONCE AGAIN FILTERING
INTO THE REGION. 850 TEMPS FALL TO AROUND -4 BY MONDAY. GFS SHOWS
A CLIPPER SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT WHICH COULD

AS ANYTHING...WINDS SHIFT ABOUT 30 DEGREES AND GET A LITTLE
GUSTIER. COLD AIR STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS ARE ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI

THIS SYSTEM IS MOISTURE STARVED AND WHILE A FEW SPRINKLES COULD
CONCEIVABLY OCCUR...DO NOT EXPECT ANY MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION.

LONG TERM (AFTER FRIDAY)...
STILL SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS BETWEEN MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ON
EVOLUTION OF PATTERN DAYS 4-7...BEFORE EVENTUALLY COMING BACK TO A
FLOW PATTERN THAT IS MAINLY OUT OF THE NORTHWEST. THERE HAVE EVEN
BEEN VERY STRONG RUN TO RUN DIFFERENCES WITHIN THE SAME MODEL.
NEEDLESS TO SAY...CONFIDENCE IN DETAILS OF ANY ONE MODEL SOLUTION

BOTH MODELS BRING A WEAK IMPULSE OUT OF THE ROCKIES BY FRIDAY NIGHT...SETTING
UP ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER OUR AREA. THE POTENTIAL FOR PRECIPITATION
EXISTS AS EARLY AS FRIDAY NIGHT...AND SEE NO REASON TO ELIMINATE

DISCUSSION...

COLD AIR CONTINUES TO POUR INTO THE REGION. 850 TEMPS AT 12Z SHOWN
TO BE AROUND -2 AT TUPELO TO -10 AT JONESBORO. SATELLITE SHOWS
COLD AIR CLOUDS ACROSS MISSOURI EXTENDING INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS.
BOTH GFS/NAM PICKING UP ON THIS MOISTURE AT THE 850MB LEVEL. THEY
SHOW THIS MOISTURE TRYING TO WORK EASTWARD BUT HAVING A TOUGH TIME
WORKING INTO THE REGION DUE TO THE DRY AIR IN PLACE. SATELLITE
TRENDS OVERNIGHT HAVE SUPPORTED THIS. BOTH MODELS SHOW THE
MOISTURE THICKENING OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND INTO NORTHWEST
TENNESSEE AS THE DIURNAL COMPONENT TAKES HOLD AND THE STRATOCU
BECOMES MORE OVERCAST. THEN THE CLOUDS SHOULD DISSIPATE BY EVENING
WITH THE LOSS OF THE SUN. GIVEN THE CLOUD COVER AND COLD AIR IN
PLACE FAVOR THE MET GUIDANCE FOR TODAY EXCEPT SOUTH OF A LINE FROM

PUSHING THE SHOWERS INTO MIDDLE TN AND ALABAMA. THE CLEAR WEDGE WILL 
GRADUALLY MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS WRN TN AND NRN MS WHILE LOW CLOUDS 
TRY TO INVADE NE AR. TEMPERATURES WILL BE TRICKY AS COLD ADVECTION

A LINE OF SHOWERS WAS MOVING ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS MORNING. THERE WERE NO CLOUD TO GROUND LIGHTNING STRIKES 
IN THE FORECAST AREA SINCE 2 AM. THE LINE OF STORMS OVER THE FA 
HAVE NOT BEEN SEVERE DUE TO THE LACK OF INSTABILITY...HOWEVER THE 
WIND PROFILES REMAIN FAVORABLE FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS. 

THE LINE OF STORMS WILL CONTINUE MOVING EASTWARD AT ABOUT 20 MPH AND 
BEGIN MOVING INTO NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND WEST TENNESSEE NEAR THE 
TN RIVER BY 6 AM. THE LINE WILL MOVE OUT OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI BY 
LATE MORNING WITH SOME SHOWERS FILLING IN BEHIND THE LINE. BY 
TONIGHT THE RAIN WILL HAVE CLEARED MOST AREAS.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE TRICKY TODAY AS MAX TEMPERATURES WILL OCCUR 
AROUND 9 AM AND THEN REMAIN STEADY OR SLOWLY FALL THROUGH THE DAY IN 
THE WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL FALL INTO THE 30S.

MUCH COOLER DAY IN STORE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK WITH MAX 
TEMPERATURES HOVERING AROUND 50 AND OVERNIGHT LOWS MAINLY IN THE

CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. NO SIGNIFICANT REASONS
FOR UPDATES AT THIS TIME. TORNADO WATCH 879 UNTIL 08Z FOR AREAS
WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.

SURFACE LOW IN KS AT 01Z WITH A DRYLINE INTO WESTERN PORTIONS OF
AR. UPPER AIR CHARTS SHOWED A 250 MB JET OF 183 KTS AT FORT WORTH AT
00Z. THIS JET LIKELY HELPING TO DRIVE DRYLINE EASTWARD...ALTHOUGH
MAIN PUNCH IS TO NORTHEAST INTO WESTERN MISSOURI.

AHEAD OF DRYLINE...DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 60S ACROSS EASTERN HALF
OF AR. WEST OF DRYLINE...A NARROW RIBBON OF DEWPOINTS IN THE TEENS
ACROSS EASTERN OK. SURFACE INSTABILITY STILL REMAINS AN ISSUE...BETWEEN
0 AND -2 FOR LIFTED INDICES. STILL PLENTY OF HELICITY
AVAILABLE...IN THE 300 TO 500 RANGE. SPC CONTINUES WITH MODERATE
RISK UP TO OUR WESTERN BORDER...AND SLIGHT OVER JUST ABOUT ALL OF
OUR CWA. SEE NO REASON TO DISAGREE WITH THAT ASSESSMENT. AS LINE
OF CONVECTION MOVES EASTWARD INTO MORE STABLE AIRMASS...HOPEFULLY
THE STORMS WILL WEAKEN AFTER MIDNIGHT.

SOUTHERN END OF LINE IN LA AND TX MAY NOT BE QUITE AS POTENT AS A
FEW HOURS AGO...BUT CONVECTION OVER AR STILL NEEDS TO BE WATCHED
CLOSELY. EARLIER TIMING OF LINE REACHING THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
AROUND MIDNIGHT...AND OUT OF THE CWA DURING THE MORNING HOURS
STILL LOOKS VALID.

SKIES ARE BEGINNING TO CLEAR UP A LITTLE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.
THIS MAY HELP FURTHER DESTABILIZE THINGS AHEAD OF THE STORM SYSTEM
MOVING INTO KANSAS. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEGUN TO DEVELOP OVER EXTREME
WESTERN ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON AND THESE STORMS HAVE ALREADY BECOME
SEVERE. COLD FRONT STILL LAGGING BEHIND SOMEWHAT ACROSS NORTHWEST
OKLAHOMA INTO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE WITH A DRY-LINE EXTENDING FROM
EASTERN OKLAHOMA INTO NORTHEAST TEXAS. MAIN SQUALL LINE HAS YET TO
DEVELOP YET BUT SHOULD START TO WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS.
EXPECT THUNDERSTORMS TO START MOVING INTO OUR FORECAST AREA LATER
THIS EVENING. MAIN THREAT WOULD BE DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS
ALONG THE SQUALL LINE WITH A RISK OF SUPERCELLS WITH THUNDERSTORMS
THAT DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE LINE. MODELS CONTINUE TO SLOW DOWN THE
MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT WHICH SHOULD REACH THE MISSISSIPPI BY AROUND
12Z AND CLEAR THE FORECAST AREA BY 00Z. THIS MEANS MORE OF THE
FORECAST AREA WILL BE AHEAD OF THE FRONT MONDAY MORNING AND THEREFORE
WILL STILL SEE A RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER. ONCE THE FRONT CLEARS...
COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL BEGIN TO FILTER INTO THE REGION. UPPER
LEVEL PATTERN WILL EVOLVE INTO MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW SO THIS WEEKS
WEATHER WILL BE MORE SEASONABLE AND MAINLY DRY. THE NEXT CHANCE OF

AREAS OF RAINFALL COVERED MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS MORNING. 
RAINFALL WAS SHOWING SIGNS OF DIMINISHING ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN 
AND WESTERN EDGES OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE LATEST ISENTROPIC 
SURFACE ANALYSIS AND FORECASTS OF THE LOWER LAYERS SUGGEST THAT 
PARCELS WILL HAVE TO BE LIFTED OVER 75 MB BEFORE SATURATING. 
THEREFORE...THIS BATCH OF RAIN SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE OUT OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING AND PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES SHOULD OCCUR 
ACROSS THE WESTERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. DAYTIME 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WELL ABOVE MACHINE NUMBERS...ESPECIALLY OVER 
MEMPHIS AND JONESBORO.

WITH THE SECOND...MORE POWERFUL SHORTWAVE APPROACHING THE MIDSOUTH 
THIS AFTERNOON ADDITIONAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL REALLY SURGE 
NORTHWARD. THE THETA E RIDGE AXIS WILL BE OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS 
THIS AFTERNOON WHICH IS RIGHT ON THE EDGE OF THE MODERATE RISK AREA 
OUTLINED BY SPC. SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL RISE INTO THE LOWER 60S THIS 
AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY FOR THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
UPPER DYNAMICS LOOKS BEST AFTER 9 PM AND WILL COINCIDE WITH WHEN THE 
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL ENTER THE AREA. THESE STORMS WILL BE 
FUELED BY A 130+ KNOT JET STREAK...STRONG SOUTHEAST BOUNDARY LAYER 
WINDS OF UP TO 30 KNOTS...LOW 60 DEWPOINTS AND A VEERING WIND 
PROFILE. PERHAPS BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON A FEW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS COULD DEVELOP OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT.

A SQUALL LINE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION OVERNIGHT. 
DAMAGING WINDS IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH WILL BE LIKELY AS WILL ISOLATED 
TORNADOES...GIVEN THE HIGH HELICITY VALUES. BELIEVE THAT THE LINE OF 
STORMS WILL MOVE FAST ENOUGH THAT WIDESPREAD FLOODING WILL NOT BE A 
PROBLEM...HOWEVER A FEW AREAS MAY SEE VERY HEAVY RAINFALL IN A SHORT 
AMOUNT OF TIME. 

BY 6 AM MONDAY...THE LINE WILL STILL BE MOVING THROUGH NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI AND PARTS OF WEST TENNESSEE. THE STORMS OVER NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE DAMAGING  
WINDS. SPC HAS OUTLOOKED THIS AREA IN SWODY2.

BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...THE MAJORITY OF THE RAINFALL WILL HAVE MOVED 
WELL EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA. BEING ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE UPPER 
LOW WILL LEAVE OUR REGION IN PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND 
COOLER TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. LONG RANGE 
MODELS ADVERTISING DRY CONDITIONS TO PERSIST FOR THE NEXT SEVEN 
DAYS.

CLOUDS ARE BUILDING INTO THE REGION FROM THE SOUTH AHEAD OF THE
UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WHICH MOVING INTO NORTHWEST LOUISIANA. SOME
SHOWERS MOVING INTO NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AT THE PRESENT TIME.
BIGGEST CHANGE IN THE WEATHER OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS HAS BEEN IN
MOISTURE AS DEWPOINTS HAVE INCREASED TO THE 40S AND LOW 50S WITH 60
DEGREE DEWPOINTS JUST SOUTH OF JACKSON MISSISSIPPI. EVERYTHING
REMAINS ON TRACK FOR A WET NIGHT LATER TONIGHT AS UPPER LEVEL
SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. PLENTY OF MOISTURE IN
THE AREA TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD RAIN WITH SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS.
THIS BATCH OF RAIN WILL HANG OVER INTO OUR EASTERN AREAS THROUGH
SUNDAY MORNING SO HAVE KEPT LIKELY POPS GOING THERE FOR SUNDAY.

BIG UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE OUT INTO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE
ON SUNDAY AND TRACK NORTHEAST THROUGH MONDAY. THE COLD FRONT
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY
NIGHT. WITH SOUTHERLY WINDS BRINGING MORE MOISTURE INTO THE REGION
AHEAD OF THE FRONT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS SO HAVE KEPT SOME
POPS IN ALL THE ZONES FOR SUNDAY. BY SUNDAY NIGHT...WE WILL SEE A
BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SO HAVE LIKELY POPS. AS
THE FRONT GETS CLOSER TO THE REGION THERE WILL BE A BETTER CHANCE OF
SEVERE WEATHER AS WELL. MAIN THREAT REMAINS DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE
WINDS BUT TORNADOES CANT BE RULED OUT. THE FRONT WILL NOT
COMPLETELY PUSH OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON
SO SOME REDEVELOPMENT OF STORMS AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON MONDAY IS A
POSSIBILITY AND AGAIN THERE MAY BE SOME SEVERE STORMS. BEHIND THE
FRONT...TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO FALL DURING THE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING HOURS. THE AIR BEHIND THIS NEXT SYSTEM WONT BE NEARLY AS
COLD AS THIS LAST ONE SO MOST LOCATIONS WILL REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING.

THE UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL BECOME MORE ZONAL AND THAT SHOULD KEEP
TEMPERATURES MORE SEASONABLE FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. ANOTHER
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION ON THURSDAY BUT NOT EXPECTING
TO SEE MUCH MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE FRONT SO DRY WEATHER SHOULD PERSIST
INTO THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEKEND.

A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WERE MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS
MORNING WITH SOME THUNDER ASSOCIATED WITH IT. SOME ADDITIONAL
SHOWERS WERE LOCATED IN CENTRAL AND WESTERN ARKANSAS WITH BULK OF
RAIN STILL DOWN IN EAST TEXAS. CURRENT FORECAST SEEMS TO BE FINE SO
NO CHANGES ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
LOW CLOUDS WERE FILTERING INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING FROM
THE WEST TO EAST. HIGH CLOUDS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA LATER
TODAY...OVERALL A MOSTLY CLOUDY DAY. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM INTO THE
LOWER AND MID 60S IN ADVANCE OF A SHORTWAVE TROUGH.

THE SHORTWAVE WAS LOCATED OVER SOUTH TEXAS THIS MORNING WHERE
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WERE DEVELOPING. LATER TODAY...THIS SYSTEM
WILL TRACK INTO THE MIDSOUTH WITH RAIN CHANCES INCREASING THIS
AFTERNOON AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT. MOST LOCATIONS WILL GET RAIN BY
SUNDAY MORNING WITH A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THE REMNANTS OF
THIS SYSTEM WILL HANG IN THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SUNDAY
MORNING...MAINLY THE EASTERN AREAS.

A POWERFUL STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE OUT OF THE ROCKIES ON SUNDAY. IN
ADVANCE OF THE UPPER LEVEL LOW...THE 50+ KNOT LOW LEVEL JET WILL
PUMP IN MUCH HIGHER DEWPOINTS THROUGH SUNDAY. DEPENDING ON THE
EVOLUTION AND SPEED OF THIS SYSTEM...WILL AFFECT THE TIME OF DAY THE
STORMS OCCUR. THE SLOWER NAM IS PREFERRED GIVEN THE STRONG JET ON
THE WEST SIDE OF THE TROUGH WHICH WOULD SEEM TO WANT TO DIG THE
UPPER LOW FARTHER SOUTH. THUS SLOWING THE SYSTEM BY ABOUT 6 HOURS OR
SO.

BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...CAPES AROUND 1000 J/KG AND A GOOD VEERING
PROFILE COULD PRODUCE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS APPROACHING SEVERE LIMITS.
HOWEVER...THE BULK OF THE LIFT AND UPPER DYNAMICS WILL STILL BE OFF
TO THE WEST. APPEARS THAT THE BEST CHANCE FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS
WILL BE AFTER 9 PM SUNDAY NIGHT. COULD SEE A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS
ALONG THE COLD FRONT MOVE ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY 5 AM.
WINDS IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH ARE LIKELY WITH THIS LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS
AS LOW AND MID LEVEL WINDS ARE IN EXCESS OF 50 KNOTS.

THE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS EASTWARD WITH MOST OF THE
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ENDING IN THE AFTERNOON...CLEARING FROM
WEST TO EAST. COLD ADVECTION THROUGH THE DAY WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES
TO WARM ONLY A FEW DEGREES DURING THE LATE MORNING HOURS.

THE UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL FLATTEN OUT AND BECOME MORE ZONAL. THE
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL OF THE WEATHER THROUGH WEDNESDAY
WILL MOVE TO THE EAST. A SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES
REGION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL SEND ANOTHER COLD FRONT INTO THE
MIDSOUTH ON THURSDAY. WILL HAVE TO WATCH IF ANY MOISTURE RETURN ON
THE WEST SIDE OF THE SURFACE HIGH OCCURS AND CAN GET CAUGHT AHEAD OF
THE FRONT. IF SO...PERHAPS ANOTHER SHOT OF RAIN COMES THURSDAY NIGHT.

MANAGED TO WARM INTO THE 40S OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. SURFACE
HIGH IS NOW EAST OF THE REGION AND AS IT CONTINUES TO MOVE TOWARD
THE ATLANTIC COAST WINDS WILL SHIFT SOUTHEAST LATER TONIGHT WHICH
SHOULD HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM DROPPING VERY MUCH. WARM FRONT
WILL SURGE NORTH ON SATURDAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WHICH WILL
HELP BRING A RAPID RETURN TO MOISTURE OVER THE REGION. THERE MAY BE A
FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE WARM FRONT
SATURDAY AFTERNOON SO HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS IN. UPPER LEVEL
SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY
MORNING BRINGING WIDESPREAD RAIN INTO THE FORECAST AREA. MOST OF
SUNDAY SHOULD BE DRY BUT WARM AS TEMPERATURES WILL APPROACH 70
DEGREES DURING THE AFTERNOON. THIS WILL HELP SET THE STAGE FOR A
POTENTIALLY STORMY SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING AS STORM SYSTEM
WILL MOVE OUT OF THE ROCKIES SUNDAY AND TRACK ACROSS SOUTHERN
KANSAS INTO SOUTHERN WISCONSIN BY MONDAY MORNING. COLD FRONT
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE
SUNDAY NIGHT. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY NIGHT AND
MONDAY AHEAD OF THE FRONT. CURRENT DAY 3 OUTLOOK HAS A SLIGHT RISK
FOR SEVERE WEATHER OVER MUCH OF NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND SOUTHERN
MISSOURI. WHILE THE MAIN THREAT WOULD BE STRAIGHT LINE WINDS...WOULD
NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME TORNADIC ACTIVITY AS WELL. THE COLD
FRONT SHOULD CLEAR THE REGION BY MONDAY AFTERNOON BUT THERE MAY STILL
BE SOME LINGERING RAIN AROUND MONDAY NIGHT SO HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS IN. BY TUESDAY HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD IN AND SHOULD
HELP BRING ANOTHER PERIOD OF DRY AND COOL WEATHER FOR THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS ANCHORED OVER SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND UPPER 
FLOW WAS NORTHWEST. THE SURFACE HIGH WILL BUILD EASTWARD AND SURFACE 
WINDS WILL BECOME SOUTHEAST BY EARLY EVENING. MEANWHILE THE UPPER 
TROUGH NEAR THE BIG BEND OF TEXAS WILL APPROACH THE AREA.

LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL COMMENCE TONIGHT IN ADVANCE OF THE 
DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM. RAIN CHANCES WILL INCREASE SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AND INTO SATURDAY NIGHT. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE MAINLY SATURDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL JET OF GREATER THAN 50 
KNOTS WILL FEED PLENTY OF MOISTURE INTO ANY STORMS THAT DEVELOP.

A MUCH STRONGER STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST 
SATURDAY. THIS SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DIG INTO THE SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES...PERHAPS AS FAR SOUTH AS THE SOUTH PLAINS OF TEXAS BEFORE 
EJECTING NORTHEAST. THIS POWERFUL STORM SYSTEM WILL HAVE THE 
CAPABILITY OF PRODUCING SEVERE WEATHER OVER MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH 
SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL RISE INTO THE LOWER 
60S AND INSTABILITY WILL BE PLENTIFUL. UPPER DYNAMICS ARE IMPRESSIVE 
AS WELL AS HELICITY. THE BULK OF BEST LIFT WILL OCCUR AFTER MIDNIGHT 
SUNDAY NIGHT. 

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY MORNING AS THE 
UPPER LEVEL LOW TRACKS INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION BY TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON. DRY AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION DIMINISHING RAIN 
CHANCES FOR TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE IN 
CONTROL THROUGH THE REMAINING OF THE FORECAST PERIOD SQUASHING ANY 
CHANCES FOR MEASURABLE PRECIP.

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING PLACES COLD FRONT ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. MAIN FORECAST 
CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE IS LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT AND CONVECTIVE 
POTENTIAL LATE THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

TODAY...COLD FRONT CURRENTLY UPSTREAM WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID 
SOUTH THIS MORNING. 850 MB TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM -1C ACROSS THE 
NORTH TO 6C ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA SUPPORT 
HIGHS IN THE 50S NORTH TO LOWER 60S SOUTH. 850-700 MB LAYER RH/S 
AROUND 60 PERCENT MAY PRODUCE SOME MID LEVEL CLOUDS WITH THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE...BUT NOT ANTICIPATING A LOT OF CLOUD COVER OVERALL. 

TONIGHT...SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL BE ALONG THE GULF COAST BY EARLY 
EVENING AS COLD ARCTIC AIR SPILLS DOWN FROM CANADA AND MODIFIES TO 
BETWEEN -5C TO +2C AS IT REACHES THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND 
1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S AT OR BELOW 35 PERCENT. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
SUGGEST THAT LOWS COULD POSSIBLY DIP BACK INTO THE TEENS ACROSS 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT FORECASTED LOWS 
OVERALL ON TRACK AND WILL ONLY MAKE MINOR AJUSTMENTS TO LOWS.

FRIDAY...COLD AIR WILL SLOWLY BEGIN TO RETREAT BACK NORTH AS HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVES EAST AND SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNS TO THE MID SOUTH. 
EXPECTING PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH A GRADUAL RETURN OF LOW/MID LEVEL 
MOISTURE. 

SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...A MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SATURDAY AND SATURDAY 
NIGHT...REACHING THE MID SOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT. BOTH NAM/GFS 
SOLUTIONS SIMILAR AND HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH POPS FOR SATURDAY 
NIGHT...EVEN WITH POOR MODEL RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY ISSUES IN THE 
MEDIUM AND LONG RANGE. AS A RESULT...MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO POPS WITH 
PRIMARILY CHANCE POPS SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND LIKELY POPS SATURDAY 
NIGHT.  

A TRAILING COLD FRONT IS STILL ANTICIPATED TO COME THROUGH DURING THE 
DAY ON MONDAY. MADE VERY LITTLE IF ANY CHANGES TO MONDAY AND BEYOND 
DUE TO POOR MODEL RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY...WITH THE GFS/EUROPEAN/AND 
DGEX. CONSEQUENTLY...WILL ONLY MENTION STRONG THUNDERSTORMS IN THE 
HWO UNTIL LATER MODEL RUNS SUPPORT A TREND TOWARDS SEVERE 
CONVECTION.

A LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE
EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS WILL
CONTINUE THROUGH THANKSGIVING DAY BEFORE SLOWLY LIFTING OUT TO THE
NORTHEAST BY THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL KEEP UPPER
LEVEL NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE END OF
THE WEEK. A SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE NORTHWEST
FLOW WILL DROP SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND INTO THE MID
ATLANTIC STATES TOMORROW. THIS WILL HELP TO PUSH A SURFACE (MAINLY
A WIND SHIFT) TROUGH ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH TONIGHT...AND A
STRONGER COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THERE
WILL BE LIMITED MOISTURE IN ADVANCE OF THESE FEATURES...SO NOT
EXPECTING ANY PRECIPITATION TONIGHT OR THURSDAY. A QUICK SHOT OF
MUCH COLDER AIR WILL START TO FILTER SOUTH INTO THE REGION BY LATE
TOMORROW AFTERNOON ON GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS. WINDS WILL BEGIN TO
DIMINISH LATER TOMORROW NIGHT AS CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
OVERHEAD. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THURSDAY NIGHT
AND WITH LIGHT WINDS LATE AND CONTINUED COLD ADVECTION...EXPECT
TEMPERATURES TO BOTTOM OUT INTO THE UPPER 10S AND 20S. AN
UNSEASONABLY COOL DAY CAN BE EXPECTED ON FRIDAY BEFORE HIGH
PRESSURE QUICKLY SLIDES EAST ON SATURDAY AND ALLOWS FOR THE RETURN
OF WARM ADVECTION AND WARMER TEMPERATURES.

THE OVERALL PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO CHANGE BY THE WEEKEND AS A
CUTOFF UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CURRENTLY OFF OF THE COAST
OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOVES EAST OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST U.S. AND
ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH BY SATURDAY NIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME...A
POTENT UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTHERN PACIFIC
WILL CRASH INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS
OVER THE WEEKEND. AS THIS OCCURS...A SURFACE LOW WILL DEVELOP IN
THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES WITH A WARM FRONT DEVELOPING AND PUSHING
NORTH TOWARDS THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. AS THIS WARM FRONT COMBINED
WITH THE LEAD SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE LIFTS NORTH ACROSS THE
MID-SOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT...EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO
DEVELOP OVER THE AREA. THE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH OF THE AREA
BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...LEAVING THE MID-SOUTH ENTRENCHED IN THE WARM
SECTOR WITH QUICKLY RISING DEWPOINTS AND MUCH WARMER TEMPERATURES.
ALSO BY LATER SUNDAY AFTERNOON...THE SECOND AND MUCH STRONGER
SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE DIGGING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...BECOMING
NEGATIVELY TILTED. AS THIS OCCURS...THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE OVER
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS SHOULD LIFT NORTHEAST INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY WHILE DEEPENING. STRONG UPPER LEVEL HEIGHT FALLS ALONG WITH
STRENTHING WIND FIELDS AND SHEAR SHOULD BEGIN TO OVERSPREAD THE
WARM SECTOR OVER THE AREA. THIS SHOULD SET THE STAGE FOR
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT OVER THE AREA LATER SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...CONTINUING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AND INTO MONDAY. AT
THIS TIME...THERE APPEARS TO BE SOME POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE
WEATHER. SINCE THIS SYSTEM IS STILL SEVERAL DAYS AWAY...THERE WILL
BE PLENTY OF TIME TO MONITOR THE EVENTUAL EVOLUTION OF THIS SYSTEM
AND ITS EFFECTS. BUT NEEDLESS TO SAY...SOMETHING TO DEFINITELY
WATCH FOR SEVERE POTENTIAL.

BY LATER MONDAY...THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD LIFT WELL TO THE
NORTH ALONG WITH THE STRONG UPPER SUPPORT. AT THIS TIME...THE
MODELS ARE HINTING THAT THE TRAILING COLD FRONT MAY STALL
SOMEWHERE ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...AS
THE SYSTEM NEVER REALLY CLEARS THROUGH THE AREA AND THE UPPER FLOW
REMAINS SOUTHWESTERLY. CONFIDENCE ON THIS PART OF THE FORECAST IS
RATHER LOW...SO FELT IT PRUDENT AT THIS POINT TO KEEP SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST THROUGH TUESDAY WITH ABOVE NORMAL
TEMPERATURES. ANOTHER SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA BY MID-
WEEK BRINGING THE NEXT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AND
KEEPING A RATHER ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IN PLACE FOR NEXT WEEK.

NEW ENGLAND WITH LONG WAVE TROUGH EXTENDING ALONG THE EAST COAST OF 
THE UNITED STATES. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING REMAINS IN PLACE ACROSS THE 
WESTERN UNITED STATES WITH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IN CYCLONIC FLOW 
WITH NUMEROUS SHORTWAVES EMBEDDED WITHIN THE SYNOPTIC FLOW. AT THE 
SURFACE A SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS ACROSS THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS LOW TEMPERATURES 
FRIDAY AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE AND NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION BY THE 
LATER HALF OF THE WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK. 

TODAY...QUIET WEATHER EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TODAY WITH WEAK 
RIDGING IN PLACE THIS MORNING. INFRARED SATELLITE THIS MORNING SHOWS 
SOME MID LEVEL CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE 
ACROSS THE EXTREME NORTHEAST SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING AND EXTENDING FURTHER NORTH ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF 
MISSOURI. WENT WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS PORTIONS OF WESTERN 
TENNESSEE THIS MORNING WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ELSEWHERE. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE IN THE 60S. A FEW AREAS MAY SEE SOME 
GUSTY WINDS THIS AFTERNOON WITH 950 MB WINDS AROUND 30 KTS. 

TONIGHT AND THANKSGIVING DAY...COLD FRONT CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS 
CENTRAL MANITOBA WILL DIVE DOWN ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
TONIGHT AND THANKSGIVING DAY. BOTH THE NAM/GFS SUGGEST FRONTAL 
PASSAGE OCCURRING DURING THE MORNING HOURS. MID LEVEL DYNAMICAL 
FORCING WITH THIS SYSTEM IS LESS THAN IDEAL AND LACKING 
MOISTURE...RESULTING IN DRY FRONTAL PASSAGE ACROSS THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 

THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...COLD NIGHT EXPECTED ACROSS PORTIONS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA AS 0C TO -5C 850 MB AIR DRAINS INTO PORTIONS OF 
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S WILL DROP TO 
AROUND 35 PERCENT AND MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST TEMPERATURES COULD 
EASILY DROP INTO THE LOWER 20S BY FRIDAY MORNING...ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

LONG RANGE (SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL ENTER 
THE PACIFIC COAST ON FRIDAY WITH A CUTOFF LOW DEVELOPING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES. MODEL RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY ISSUES PERSIST 
WITH THIS SECTION OF THE FORECAST AS A PATTERN SHIFT IS ABOUT TO 
TAKE PLACE NEXT WEEK WITH THE MID SOUTH TRANSITIONING FROM NORTHWEST 
FLOW TO SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. THE GFS/EUROPEAN...ESPECIALLY BEYOND 
144 HRS AS THE LATEST RUN OF THE GFS PLACES THE UPPER LEVEL LOW 
ACROSS OKLAHOMA AND THE EUROPEAN SOLUTION PREFERRING THE LOW ACROSS 
MINNESOTA. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH BOTH THE 00Z GFS AND 06Z DGEX SHOW 
THE UPPER LEVEL LOW BECOMING NEGATIVELY TILTED BY 12Z TUESDAY ACROSS 
MISSOURI...BUT NOT READY JUST YET TO BUY INTO THAT SOLUTION WITH 
MODEL CONSISTENCY ISSUES.  OTHER SOLUTIONS FROM THE NOGAPS...DGEX AND 
CANADIAN SUPPORT THE GFS AND WILL TREND TOWARDS GFS SOLUTION. AS A 
RESULT...ADJUSTED POPS TO CHANCE SATURDAY NIGHT AS COLD FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY MOVES BACK NORTH AS A WARM FRONT ACROSS THE AREA INTO

CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT AS AN UPPER 
LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DRIFTS SOUTHEASTWARD FROM SOUTHWEST 
MISSOURI. IN ADDITION...A SFC LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP OVER 
THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE AND WILL SPREAD CLOUDS NORTHWESTWARD ALONG 
WITH A CHANCE FOR RAIN. EXPECT BULK OF RAINFALL TO REMAIN OVER 
SOUTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH. ALTHOUGH OTHER PARTS OF THE 
CWA STILL COULD SEE A FEW SPRINKLES AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES THROUGH 
THE AREA. THESE TWO SYSTEMS WILL SLOWLY MOVE EASTWARD BUT WILL 
CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE WEATHER ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH THROUGH LATE 
MONDAY. EXPECT MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY CONDITIONS DURING THIS TIME 
WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH FOR THE MIDDLE PART OF 
THE WEEK. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO SLOWLY MODERATE WITH DRY CONDITIONS 
CONTINUING ACROSS THE AREA.

A REINFORCING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THOUGH THE MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. THE FRONT WILL COME THROUGH THE AREA DRY BUT WILL BRING 
COOLER TEMPERATURES TO THE AREA FOR THE THANKSGIVING WEEKEND. EXPECT 
HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S WITH LOWS IN THE 20S 
AND 30S DURING MUCH OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND WITH DRY CONDITIONS.

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP EARLY SUNDAY ACROSS TEXAS AND 
WILL MOVE TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH. EXPECT THE SYSTEM TO BRING THE BEST

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDS THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
PLAINS THIS MORNING WITH A CLOSED LOW OVER KS. MID-LEVEL CLOUDS
ARE STREAMING ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH IN ADVANCE OF THIS SYSTEM
HELPING TO HOLD TEMPERATURES UP ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. THINK
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH TODAY AS THE UPPER
TROUGH EDGES CLOSER. IN ADDITION...WILL ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
LIGHT RAIN TO PART OF NORTHEAST AR FOR TODAY AS SATELLITE SHOWS
SOME ENHANCEMENT OF THE CLOUD TOPS ACROSS WESTERN AR MOVING EAST. 

GENERALLY WILL FOLLOW THE GFS IN THIS MORNINGS FORECAST...WHICH
AGREES CLOSELY WITH WHAT WE HAVE GOING. THE CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW
WILL DIG TO OUR SOUTH AND THEN MOVE TO OUR EAST BY MONDAY
AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE...A SURFACE LOW IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP ALONG
THE FL/GA BORDER TONIGHT...THEN MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ALONG THE EAST
COAST. WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR CURRENT POP FORECAST RANGING FROM SMALL
POPS TONIGHT AND MONDAY FROM EXTREME NORTHEAST AR INTO EXTREME
NORTHWEST TN TO LIKELY POPS ACROSS NORTHEAST MS. THE GREATEST
THREAT OF RAIN WILL BE OVER NORTHEAST MS WHERE THE MOISTURE WILL
BE GREATER AND ALSO CLOSER TO THE DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW. RAIN
AMOUNTS WILL BE MOSTLY LIGHT AS WE NEVER GET A GOOD SOUTHERLY
INFLUX OF MOISTURE AT THE LOWER LEVELS.

THE UPPER LOW WILL MOVE TO OUR EAST MONDAY NIGHT TAKING THE RAIN
WITH IT. COLDER AIR WILL SPILL INTO THE MID-SOUTH ON NORTHERLY WINDS MONDAY
NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS A TIGHT GRADIENT EXIST BETWEEN SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
TO OUR WEST AND THE LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE EAST COAST. RELATIVE
HUMIDITY PROGS INDICATE COLD AIR STRATOCUMULUS SPREADING INTO MUCH
OF THE MID-SOUTH LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING. A 500 MB VORT
MAX IS FORECAST TO AFFECT EASTERN AREAS OF THE MID-SOUTH LATE
MONDAY NIGHT...COULD SQUEEZE OUT SOME SNOW FLURRIES BUT WILL NOT
MENTION ATTM.

A BRIEF WARMUP WILL OCCUR WEDNESDAY AS WINDS TURN TO THE
SOUTHWEST. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH FROM THE
NORTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT BRINGING ANOTHER SHOT OF COLD AIR FROM THANKSGIVING
INTO FRIDAY. THE LATEST GFS INDICATES SOME MOISTURE BEHIND THE
FRONT...BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP THE FORECAST DRY INDICATING ONLY CLOUDS.

SATELLITE SHOWS WIDESPREAD MID-LEVEL CLOUDS STREAMING TOWARD THE
MID-SOUTH FROM THE SOUTHWEST THIS MORNING. THESE CLOUDS ARE AHEAD
OF AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...WHICH
IS FORECAST TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH TODAY AND
BECOME SHEARED. THINK THESE CLOUDS WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA THIS
MORNING. CAN NOT RULE OUT A SPRINKLE OR TWO...BUT THE LOWER LEVELS
ARE RATHER DRY SO WILL NOT MENTION IN THE FORECAST. ATTM...NO
PRECIPITATION IS BEING REPORTED AT THE SURFACE IN ASSOCIATION WITH
THESE CLOUDS. WILL GO CLOSE TO THE COOLER MAV GUIDANCE SINCE THINK
THESE CLOUDS WILL HELP TO PUT A DAMPER ON HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...THE SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE OUT OF THE MID-SOUTH LEAVING
THE AREA IN A LULL WEATHERWISE. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL DEEPEN TO
THE WEST OF THE MID-SOUTH IN THE SOUTHERN / CENTRAL PLAINS (NAM AND
GFS DIFFER ON EXACT PLACEMENT). THIS UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL BE THE
MAIN INFLUENCE OVER OUR WEATHER SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. THIS LOW IS
FORECAST TO TRACK ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH WHILE A STRONG SURFACE LOW
DEVELOPS ALONG THE EAST COAST. THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE
CONSIDERABLY FASTER IN SPEED WITH THIS SYSTEM THAN THE NAM...WILL
LEAN TOWARD THE GFS / ECMWF BUT NOT TOTALLY DISCOUNT THE NAM ATTM.
THINK WE WILL SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS SUNDAY...THEN A CHANCE OF
RAIN SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. RAIN CHANCES MAY NEED TO BE
INCREASED IN LATER FORECASTS. HOWEVER...WITH THE LOWER LEVELS
STARTING RATHER DRY AND NOT A GOOD SOUTHERLY FLOW AT THE LOWER
LEVELS...THINK MOST RAIN AMOUNTS WILL BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE. THE

AIR WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA TUESDAY WITH A TIGHT SURFACE GRADIENT

354 AM CST WED NOV 16 2005

.DISCUSSION...

A MUCH CALMER MORNING AS COMPARED TO 24 HOURS AGO. THE COLD FRONT
THAT BROUGHT YESTERDAYS SEVERE WEATHER HAS SWEPT WELL TO THE
EAST. THIS MORNING WE ARE LEFT WITH MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES AS A
CANADIAN AIRMASS HAS FILTERED IN BEHIND THE FRONT. THERE ARE CLOUDS
LINGERING ACROSS THE AREA...WITH A LOW OVERCAST ACROSS PORTIONS OF
NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA AND A MID LEVEL DECK
ACROSS SOUTHEAST SECTIONS. EXPECT PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS
MOST AREAS...WITH THE EXCEPTION BEING ACROSS NORTHEAST AREAS WHERE
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES WILL CONTINUE THIS MORNING. SKIES SHOULD
QUICKLY CLEAR OUT BY THIS AFTERNOON...LEAVING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES
AREAWIDE AS CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD IN. TEMPERATURES
WILL STRUGGLE ALL DAY AS STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES WITH
850 MB TEMPS PLUNGING TO -2 C SOUTH TO -8 C NORTH. THIS WILL BE
OUR FIRST TASTE OF WINTER...WITH HIGHS ONLY REACHING INTO THE 40S
TO AROUND 50.

AS HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES FURTHER EAST AND CLOSER TO THE MID-SOUTH
TONIGHT...WE SHOULD SEE WINDS LIGHTEN ACROSS THE AREA...AND WITH
CLEAR SKIES...WILL SEE THE COLDEST NIGHT SO FAR THIS YEAR.
TEMPERATURES WILL PLUNGE DEEP INTO THE 20S FOR MOST
AREAS...BRINGING A HARD FREEZE AND AN END TO THE GROWING SEASON
FOR MOST LOCATIONS. THEREFORE...HAVE ISSUED A FREEZE WARNING FOR
THE ENTIRE CWA. UNSEASONABLY COOL CONDITIONS UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR
SKIES WILL CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT AS HIGH
PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE AREA. ACTUALLY...THURSDAY NIGHT MAY BE
EVEN A FEW DEGREES COLDER...AS EXCELLENT RADIAIONAL COOLING
CONDITIONS SHOULD DEVELOP.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE EAST ON FRIDAY...ALLOWING FOR CONTINUED
DRY CONDITIONS AND A SLOW MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES...BUT STILL
BELOW NORMAL INTO THE WEEKEND. THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN
NORTHWESTERLY THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH UPPER LEVEL
SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCES MOVING THROUGH THE FLOW EVERY COUPLE OF
DAYS. THE FIRST SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEM WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH AN EVEN MORE POTENT
TYPE CLIPPER SYSTEM PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH NEXT MONDAY NIGHT AND
TUESDAY. MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED AHEAD OF THESE SYSTEMS...SO NOT
EXPECTING ANY PRECIPITATION...ONLY MID-LEVEL CLOUDS. THE ONLY
EXCEPTION WILL BE WITH THE SYSTEM EARLY NEXT WEEK. THERE MAY
EVENTUALLY END UP BEING SUFFICIENT MOISTURE FOR PRECIP...BUT
PREFER TO HOLD OFF FOR NOW SINCE THIS IS WELL INTO THE EXTENDED
PERIOD AND WOULD LIKE TO SEE FURTHER MODEL CONSISTENCY WITH THIS FEATURE.
IN ADDITION...TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE
EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH EACH OF THESE SHORTWAVE/CLIPPER FEATURES
SERVING TO REINFORCE COOLER AIR ACROSS THE AREA.

OUT OF NECESSITY...SEVERE WEATHER...DISCUSSION WILL BE FAIRLY
SHORT...FOR ME. IF SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO WHAT IS
CURRENTLY OUT THERE...WILL UPDATE THIS DISCUSSION.

TWO LINES OF THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF STRONG COLD FRONT...WITH
SECOND LINE JUST ENTERING NORTHWEST CORNER OF CWA. TEMPS AHEAD OF

FIRST PERIOD POPS WILL BE BASED ON RADAR TRENDS AROUND 2130Z.
SURE THAT SPC WILL ISSUE ANOTHER WATCH FOR PORTIONS OF CWA NEAR
PRESS TIME...AS CURRENT WATCH EXPIRES AT 23Z. WILL LIKELY CLEAR
COUNTIES BEHIND SECOND LINE BY PRESS TIME. WILL PROBABLY LET WIND
ADVISORY EXPIRE AT 00Z...WILL KEEP AN EYE ON OBS BEHIND FRONT TILL
PRESS TIME.

MUCH COLDER BEHIND FRONT. VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS COLD AIR STRATUS
BEHIND FRONT ACROSS ABOUT NORTHERN HALF OF AR. QUESTION BECOMES
WHETHER THIS CLOUD COVER WILL LIFT OUT OF AREA BY MORNING. CURRENT
FORECASTS ARE THAT CLOUDS SHOULD CLEAR MOST OR ALL OF AREA BY MID-
MORNING TOMORROW. TEMPS BEHIND IN SUNSHINE WELL BEHIND FRONT ARE
AROUND 50...SO THIS LOOKS REASONABLE FOR HIGHS TOMORROW.

WINDS DECOUPLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SKIES CLEAR...DEWPOINTS IN THE
TEENS. ALL ELEMENTS IN PLACE FOR A WIDESPREAD FREEZE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. WITH SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE WEATHER IN AREA THIS
AFTERNOON...WILL NOT CONFUSE ISSUE WITH ANOTHER HEADLINE. FREEZE

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 739 AM CST TUE NOV 15 2005) 

UPDATE TO GO HIGH RISK FOR ENTIRE MID-SOUTH AND ADD PDS TORNADO
WATCH 865...

..SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK LIKELY ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH
   THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...

..HIGH RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE ENTIRE MID-SOUTH...
..PARTICULARLY DANGEROUS SITUATION TORNADO WATCH 865 UNTIL 5 PM CST
   FOR THE ENTIRE MID-SOUTH...
..WIND ADVISORY UNTIL 6 PM CST FOR THE ENTIRE MID-SOUTH...

A CLASSIC SEVERE WEATHER SETUP WILL LEAD TO NUMEROUS SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. A
VIGOROUS MID/UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE WILL CONTINUE TO
DIVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES TODAY...INITIATED
BY A STRONG 120 KT UPPER TROPOSPHERIC JET STREAK NOW DROPPING INTO
THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH DIGGING OVER THE PLAINS. AS THIS JET
STREAK ROUNDS THE BEND AND EJECTS OUT OF THE BASE OF THE TROUGH AND
STRENGTHENS...THE REGION WILL BECOME LOCATED IN THE FAVORABLE
RIGHT ENTRANCE QUADRANT WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO STRONG LARGE SCALE
ASCENT ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA LATER TODAY. AS THIS DISTURBANCE
SWINGS THROUGH IT WILL HELP TO STRENGTHEN A SURFACE LOW CURRENTLY
ANALYZED OVER NORTH OKLAHOMA EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS
STRENGTHENING SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS SOUTHERN
MISSOURI THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS FEATURE WILL SERVE TO FURTHER
STRENGTHEN THE LOW LEVEL FLOW...AND FURTHER BACK SURFACE WINDS
OVER THE AREA. IN ADDITION...AS THE STRONG UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE
APPROACHES IT WILL HELP TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE LOW LEVEL JET
OVER THE AREA...WHICH AS OF 09Z WAS ANALYZED AT 40 KTS PER THE OKO
WIND PROFILER. THIS LOW LEVEL JET IS FORECAST BY THE MODELS TO
STRENGTHEN TO OVER 60 KTS BY THIS AFTERNOON. ENOUGH MIXING TO
HEIGHTS WHERE THESE STRONG WINDS EXIST WILL ALLOW FOR STRONG AND
GUSTY SURFACE WINDS ACROSS THE AREA. THEREFORE...HAVE ISSUED A
WIND ADVISORY AREAWIDE TODAY. IN ADDITION...EXPECT SHEAR PROFILES TO
BE VERY STRONG THIS AFTERNOON. IMPRESSIVE 0-1 KM HELICITY VALUES WILL
RANGE BETWEEN 150-300 M2/S2 AFTER 18Z. SO OVERALL VERY STRONG
SHEAR AND HELICITY VALUES...WILL ALLOW FOR AN ENHANCED TORNADO
THREAT...ESPECIALLY WITH DISCRETE SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS THAT
MAY FORM AHEAD OF AN EXPECTED SEVERE SQUALL LINE.

THE ENTIRE AREA IS CURRENTLY WELL ENTRENCHED IN THE WARM SECTOR
THIS MORNING...AS THE WARM FRONT THAT PASSED THROUGH THE AREA
YESTERDAY IS NOW SITUATED JUST NORTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA. THIS
WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO SURGE FURTHER NORTHWARD IN RESPONSE TO
THE STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET. TEMPERATURES AREAWIDE AT 09Z WERE
AROUND 70 WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S. THIS WARM AND
HUMID AIRMASS WILL SUPPORT MUCAPE VALUES BETWEEN 1000-2000 J/KG
AREAWIDE LATER TODAY. IN ADDITION...AS HEIGHT FALLS SPREAD OVER
THE WARM SECTOR BY AFTERNOON...EXPECT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE MORE
DISCRETE THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE WARM
SECTOR. THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL HAVE PLENTY OF SHEAR AND
INSTABILITY TO ALLOW THEM TO GAIN SUPERCELL CHARACTERISTICS...WITH
AN ENHANCED TORNADO THREAT AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF A STRONG
TORNADO. AS THE SURFACE LOW PULLS FURTHER NORTH AND EAST IT WILL HELP
TO DRAG A STRONG COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO
THIS EVENING. WIND FIELDS THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WILL THEN BECOME
INCREASINGLY UNIDIRECTIONAL...BUT STILL VERY STRONG. THIS SHOULD
SUPPORT AN INTENSE SQUALL LINE TO DEVELOP...WITH A THREAT OF
DAMAGING STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADOES. THERE WILL BE A
THREAT FOR SIGNIFICANT WIND EVENTS IN ANY PRONOUNCED BOW ECHOES
THAT CAN DEVELOP.

THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL END ABRUPTLY AFTER PASSAGE OF THE
COLD FRONT...AND SHOULD END BY EARLY THIS EVENING WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS OUR EASTERN ZONES.
MUCH COLDER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT.

THE EXTENDED FORECAST WILL BE DOMINATED BY DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW
ALOFT WITH EMBEDDED NORTHERN STREAM DISTURBANCES MOVING THROUGH
THE FLOW EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS. NOT EXPECTING ANY RETURN FLOW OF
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AHEAD OF THESE FEATURES...SO THESE FRONTS WILL
SIMPLY SERVE TO REINFORCE COLDER TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE AREA.
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD
WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOME KILLING FREEZES...ESPECIALLY WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY NIGHTS.

AGAIN...SEVERE WEATHER IS LIKELY THIS AFTERNOON SO PLAN NOW FOR
WHAT YOU WILL DO IF A WARNING IS ISSUED FOR YOUR AREA.

APPROACHES IT WILL HELP TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN THE LOW LEVEL JET
OVER THE AREA...WHICH AS OF 09Z WAS ANALYZED AT 40 KTS PER THE OKO
WIND PROFILER. THIS LOW LEVEL JET IS FORECAST BY THE MODELS TO
STRENGTHEN TO OVER 60 KTS BY THIS AFTERNOON. ENOUGH MIXING TO
HEIGHTS WHERE THESE STRONG WINDS EXIST WILL ALLOW FOR STRONG AND
GUSTY SURFACE WINDS ACROSS THE AREA. THEREFORE...HAVE ISSUED A
WIND ADVISORY AREAWIDE TODAY. IN ADDITION...EXPECT SHEAR PROFILES TO
BE VERY STRONG THIS AFTERNOON. IMPRESSIVE 0-1 KM HELICITY VALUES WILL
RANGE BETWEEN 150-300 M2/S2 AFTER 18Z. SO OVERALL VERY STRONG
SHEAR AND HELICITY VALUES...WILL ALLOW FOR AN ENHANCED TORNADO
THREAT...ESPECIALLY WITH DISCRETE SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS THAT
MAY FORM AHEAD OF AN EXPECTED SEVERE SQUALL LINE.

THE ENTIRE AREA IS CURRENTLY WELL ENTRENCHED IN THE WARM SECTOR
THIS MORNING...AS THE WARM FRONT THAT PASSED THROUGH THE AREA
YESTERDAY IS NOW SITUATED JUST NORTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA. THIS
WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO SURGE FURTHER NORTHWARD IN RESPONSE TO
THE STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET. TEMPERATURES AREAWIDE AT 09Z WERE
AROUND 70 WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S. THIS WARM AND
HUMID AIRMASS WILL SUPPORT MUCAPE VALUES BETWEEN 1000-2000 J/KG
AREAWIDE LATER TODAY. IN ADDITION...AS HEIGHT FALLS SPREAD OVER
THE WARM SECTOR BY AFTERNOON...EXPECT THE POSSIBILITY OF THE MORE
DISCRETE THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE WARM
SECTOR. THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL HAVE PLENTY OF SHEAR AND
INSTABILITY TO ALLOW THEM TO GAIN SUPERCELL CHARACTERISTICS...WITH
AN ENHANCED TORNADO THREAT AND EVEN THE POSSIBILITY OF A STRONG
TORNADO. AS THE SURFACE LOW PULLS FURTHER NORTH AND EAST IT WILL HELP
TO DRAG A STRONG COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO
THIS EVENING. WIND FIELDS THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE WILL THEN BECOME
INCREASINGLY UNIDIRECTIONAL...BUT STILL VERY STRONG. THIS SHOULD
SUPPORT AN INTENSE SQUALL LINE TO DEVELOP...WITH A THREAT OF
DAMAGING STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADOES. THERE WILL BE A
THREAT FOR SIGNIFICANT WIND EVENTS IN ANY PRONOUNCED BOW ECHOES
THAT CAN DEVELOP.

THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL END ABRUPTLY AFTER PASSAGE OF THE
COLD FRONT...AND SHOULD END BY EARLY THIS EVENING WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS OUR EASTERN ZONES.
MUCH COLDER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT.

THE EXTENDED FORECAST WILL BE DOMINATED BY DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW
ALOFT WITH EMBEDDED NORTHERN STREAM DISTURBANCES MOVING THROUGH
THE FLOW EVERY COUPLE OF DAYS. NOT EXPECTING ANY RETURN FLOW OF
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AHEAD OF THESE FEATURES...SO THESE FRONTS WILL
SIMPLY SERVE TO REINFORCE COLDER TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE AREA.
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD
WITH THE LIKELIHOOD OF SOME KILLING FREEZES...ESPECIALLY WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY NIGHTS.

AGAIN...SEVERE WEATHER IS LIKELY THIS AFTERNOON SO PLAN NOW FOR
WHAT YOU WILL DO IF A WARNING IS ISSUED FOR YOUR AREA.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
745 PM CST MON NOV 14 2005

.DISCUSSION...

MAPS INDICATE A WARM FRONT NOW FROM EVANSVILLE TO JONESBORO AND
ON TO SOUTH OF FORT SMITH. THUNDERSTORMS ARE NOW NORTH OF THE
FRONT WHILE SHOWERS ARE DEVELOPING OFF AND ON IN WEST TENNESSEE
AND SOUTHEAST OF TUPELO. MOISTURE CONTINUES TO INCREASE OVER THE
AREA AND SPC INDICATED STORMS COULD EVEN DEVELOP SOUTH OF THE
FRONT THIS EVENING. BUT...THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE FARTHER
NORTH TONIGHT AND TAKE MOST OF THE WEATHER WITH IT.

A SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER EVENT IS STILL EXPECTED TUESDAY...
MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

...PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
WARM FRONT MOVING NORTHWARD THROUGH CWA...PROBABLY NEAR A JBR-
DYR-HZD LINE AT 20Z. TEMPERATURES MAINLY IN THE 70S TO SOUTH OF
FRONT WITH DEWPOINTS IN MID 60S...TEMPS IN THE 50S ONCE YOU GET
ABOUT 50 MILES NORTH OF WARM FRONT. CLOUDS HAVE SCATTERED OUT
SOME TO THE SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT. ALONG AND NORTH OF THE
FRONT...SCATTERED CONVECTION HAS BROKEN OUT. WITH STRONG WIND
FIELDS...SPC HAS ISSUED TORNADO WATCH 861 FOR ABOUT WEST HALF OF
CWA UNTIL 03Z. &&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH THURSDAY)...
ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER WILL BE IN THE SHORT TERM PORTION
OF FORECAST. VORT MOVING OUT OF THE ROCKIES THIS EVENING WILL
TAKE A DEEPENING LOW FROM THE TEXAS PANHANDLE TO LAKE MICHIGAN BY
TOMORROW EVENING. WIND FIELDS WILL BE RATHER STRONG WITH H850
WINDS INCREASING TO AROUND 70 KTS BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

AS WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH OF THE AREA TONIGHT...AND WE LOSE
SURFACE HEATING...MAIN SEVERE WEATHER THREAT FOR THE OVERNIGHT
HOURS WILL DIMINISH. ALL SIGNS POINT TO SIGNIFICANT SEVERE
WEATHER EVENT ON TUESDAY. LIFTED INDICES AROUND -3 TO -4...MU
CAPES OF 1000-2000...0-3KM HELICITIES NEAR 500 AND 0-1KM
HELICITIES OF 200-300. EXPECT SQUALL LINE TO BE OVER CENTRAL
ARKANSAS AROUND 18Z ON TUESDAY...ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
AROUND 22Z...AND OUT OF THE CWA AROUND 03Z. MAIN THREAT TO BE
DAMAGING WINDS...BUT ANY SUPERCELLS THAT DEVELOP IN ADVANCE OF
THE LINE WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE TORNADOES.
GENERALLY...SURFACE WINDS TOMORROW SHOULD STAY JUST SHORT OF WIND
ADVISORY CRITERIA...AND DONT PLAN ON HEADLINING FOR THAT RIGHT
NOW. WILL BE CARRYING 40 TO 60 POPS TONIGHT...AND CATEGORICAL
AREA WIDE TOMORROW. WILL PLACE MENTION OF SEVERE IN ALL AREAS
TOMORROW. PRECIP SHOULD MOVE OUT OF MOST OF CWA DURING THE
EVENING TOMORROW...AND EVERYWHERE BY WEDNESDAY MORNING.

MUCH COLDER AIR TO MOVE INTO THE AREA WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS
FRONT. H850 TEMPS WILL FALL FROM ABOUT +14 AT 00Z WEDNESDAY TO
ABOUT -4 BY 18Z WEDNESDAY AT MEMPHIS. THIS WILL PRODUCE MUCH
COLDER TEMPERATURES FOR WEDNESDAY. FORECAST HIGHS WILL BE IN THE
LOWER 50S IN MOST AREAS...AND IF CLOUDS ARE SLOW TO CLEAR...THIS
COULD BE HIGHLY OPTIMISTIC. SURFACE WINDS WILL DECOUPLE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...AND WITH CLEAR SKIES...EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO PLUNGE.
EXPECTING A WIDESPREAD FREEZE FOR THURSDAY MORNING. FORECAST WILL
LIKELY NEED TO BE HEADLINED FOR THIS LATER...BUT WILL JUST WORRY
ABOUT CONVECTIVE ISSUES IN THIS PACKAGE. DO NOT SEE HIGHS ON
THURSDAY BEING ANY WARMER THAN THOSE ON WEDNESDAY.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER THURSDAY)...
AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER WEST COAST...THERE WILL BE SEVERAL
IMPULSES MOVING TOWARD THE EAST COAST THROUGH NORTHWEST FLOW.
TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL IMPULSES VARIES WITH THE DIFFERENT MODELS.
GFS INDICATES MOISTURE TOO LIMITED FOR PRECIPITATION FOR MOST OF
THE EXTENDED FORECAST PERIOD. LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL NOT GAIN A

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
1028 AM CST MON NOV 14 2005

.UPDATED DISCUSSION...
WARM FRONT HAS PROGRESSED NORTHWARD TO NEAR THE TN-MS STATE LINE. ALL
MODELS CONSISTENT IN MOVING FRONT TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA BY
EVENING. AREAL COVERAGE OF CONVECTION HAS DECREASED TO THE SOUTH OF
THE FRONT...AND HAVE LOWERED POPS TO THE CHANCE RANGE THERE. NO
REAL CLEARING YET...WHICH WILL HELP IN TAMING THE THREAT OF SEVERE
WEATHER IN THE SHORT TERM...THROUGH ABOUT 20Z.

DEWPOINTS ALREADY IN THE UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70 AS CLOSE AS GWO...SO
AIRMASS WILL DEFINITELY BE JUICY. HAVENT MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES TO FORECAST OTHER THAN POPS BASED ON RADAR TRENDS.

THINGS STILL LOOK ON TRACK FOR SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER EVENT
DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS ON TUESDAY. OFFICE IS PLANNING ON PHONE
CONFERENCE WITH MEDIA AND EMA AROUND 19Z THIS AFTERNOON. WILL GET
INTO MORE DETAIL WITH PARAMETERS...ETC...WITH AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

&&

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 410 AM CST...

CURRENTLY...STATIONARY FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM NRN AL THROUGH
N CNTRL MS INTO NRN LA THIS MORNING. A LARGE SURFACE DEWPOINT
GRADIENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT. DEWPOINTS WERE IN THE
MID 30S ACROSS NRN SECTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH AND THE MID 60S
ACROSS CNTRL MS. THE FRONT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ACTIVE OVERNIGHT
WITH NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER N CNTRL
MS.

TODAY AND TONIGHT...THE WARM FRONT WILL SURGE NORTH TODAY MOVING
TO THE MS/TN BORDER BY 18Z AND TO THE TN/KY BORDER BY 00Z.
MEANWHILE A SIGNIFICANT 500 MB SHORTWAVE WILL EXIT THE ROCKIES
AND MOVE INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LATER TODAY PLACING THE
MID SOUTH IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE ASSOCIATED JET
STREAK. THE 30-35 KT SWLY LOW LEVEL JET WILL TRANSPORT MOISTURE
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE WARM FRONT. THE INGREDIENTS FOR LIFT AND
SUSTAINED MOISTURE TRANSPORT ARE IN PLACE SO EXPECT PLENTY OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY. WILL GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS
FOR MOST PLACES WITH LIKELY POPS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS. TEMPS
WILL BE WARMEST ACROSS NORTHERN MS WHERE THE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE
THROUGH THIS MORNING. READINGS IN LOWER 70S SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM
THERE...MAYBE HIGHER DEPENDING ON CLOUDS AND PRECIP. COOLEST TEMPS
ARE EXPECTED ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER WHERE LOWER 60S WILL BE THE
TARGET.

THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER LATER TODAY AND THIS
EVENING FOR THE ENTIRE MID SOUTH. VERTICAL WIND PROFILES WILL SUPPORT
SUPERCELL DEVELOPMENT...ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF THE WARM
FRONT...IF ENOUGH INSTABILITY IS PRESENT. SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL
RISE INTO THE MID 60S SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT WITH MLCAPES OF 500-
1500 J/KG POSSIBLE BY THIS EVENING. IF SUPERCELLS ARE ABLE TO
DEVELOP THEN DAMAGING WINDS...HAIL AND A FEW TORNADOES ARE
POSSIBLE.

THE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE INTO SRN MO/WRN KY BY MIDNIGHT AND THE
SEVERE THREAT SHOULD DIMINISH FOR THE TIME BEING. WL GO WITH
THE HIGHEST POPS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS TONIGHT WITH LESSER POPS
ACRS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. IT WILL BE A MILD NIGHT WITH TEMPS IN
THE LOWER 60S MOST PLACES.

TUESDAY...THIS SYSTEM IS LOOKING MORE IMPRESSIVE ALL THE TIME. ETA

.DISCUSSION...

CURRENTLY...STATIONARY FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM NRN AL THROUGH
N CNTRL MS INTO NRN LA THIS MORNING. A LARGE SURFACE DEWPOINT
GRADIENT WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT. DEWPOINTS WERE IN THE
MID 30S ACROSS NRN SECTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH AND THE MID 60S
ACROSS CNTRL MS. THE FRONT HAS BECOME INCREASINGLY ACTIVE OVERNIGHT
WITH NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER N CNTRL
MS.

TODAY AND TONIGHT...THE WARM FRONT WILL SURGE NORTH TODAY MOVING
TO THE MS/TN BORDER BY 18Z AND TO THE TN/KY BORDER BY 00Z.
MEANWHILE A SIGNIFICANT 500 MB SHORTWAVE WILL EXIT THE ROCKIES
AND MOVE INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LATER TODAY PLACING THE
MID SOUTH IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE ASSOCIATED JET
STREAK. THE 30-35 KT SWLY LOW LEVEL JET WILL TRANSPORT MOISTURE
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE WARM FRONT. THE INGREDIENTS FOR LIFT AND
SUSTAINED MOISTURE TRANSPORT ARE IN PLACE SO EXPECT PLENTY OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY. WILL GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS
FOR MOST PLACES WITH LIKELY POPS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS. TEMPS
WILL BE WARMEST ACROSS NORTHERN MS WHERE THE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE
THROUGH THIS MORNING. READINGS IN LOWER 70S SHOULD BE NO PROBLEM
THERE...MAYBE HIGHER DEPENDING ON CLOUDS AND PRECIP. COOLEST TEMPS
ARE EXPECTED ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER WHERE LOWER 60S WILL BE THE
TARGET.

THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER LATER TODAY AND THIS
EVENING FOR THE ENTIRE MID SOUTH. VERTICAL WIND PROFILES WILL SUPPORT
SUPERCELL DEVELOPMENT...ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF THE WARM
FRONT...IF ENOUGH INSTABILITY IS PRESENT. SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL
RISE INTO THE MID 60S SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT WITH MLCAPES OF 500-
1500 J/KG POSSIBLE BY THIS EVENING. IF SUPERCELLS ARE ABLE TO
DEVELOP THEN DAMAGING WINDS...HAIL AND A FEW TORNADOES ARE
POSSIBLE.

THE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE INTO SRN MO/WRN KY BY MIDNIGHT AND THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
813 PM CST SUN NOV 13 2005

.DISCUSSION...QUASI STATIONARY SURFACE BOUNDARY STRETCHES FROM 
WESTERN TENNESSEE TO NORTHERN/CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI AND THEN INTO 
NORTHERN LOUISIANA. THIS BOUNDARY WILL SLOWLY BEGIN TO MOVE BACK 
NORTH AS A WARM FRONT MONDAY. ADDITIONAL CONVECTION OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF HOURS HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...SLOWLY 
DRIFTING EAST NORTHEAST. ACROSS THE MID SOUTH...CONVECTION SLOWLY 
BEGINNING TO INCREASE ONCE AGAIN ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS AND STABILITY PARAMETERS SUGGEST THAT THUNDER WILL 
BE MINIMAL AND ELEVATED IF ANY DEVELOPS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. NORTH 
OF THE STALLED OUT BOUNDARY A FEW SPOTS ALREADY REPORTING 1-2 SM 
VISIBILITIES. WILL ISSUE AN UPDATE TO ADJUST FORECAST FOR 
PRECIPITATION/TEMPERATURE TRENDS AND TO ADD PATCHY FOG TO AREAS 
ALONG AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY. 

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY.

CJC 

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 310 PM CST SUN NOV 13 2005...

SURFACE MAP SHOWS THE COLD FRONT HAS PASSED THROUGH JONESBORO AND
EXTENDS SOUTHWEST THROUGH CENTRAL ARKANSAS. BOTH GFS/NAM SHOW THE
FRONT MOVING TO NEAR I 40 BY 00Z AND BECOMING ORIENTED WEST TO
EAST ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND NORTHERN HALF OF
MISSISSIPPI OVERNIGHT. RAIN CHANCES EXIST OVERNIGHT WITH BOTH
MODELS SHOWING SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. THUNDER WILL LIKELY BE LIMITED DUE TO LACK
OF INSTABILITY ALTHOUGH THERE IS ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR A RUMBLE
OF THUNDER. GFS/NAM SHOWING A GOOD DEAL OF 850MB MOISTURE HANGING
AROUND MUCH OF THE AREA. EXPECT CLEARING TO BE LIMITED TO EXTREME
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS INTO THE BOOTHEEL.

TOMORROW...FRONT WILL BEGIN TO SLOWLY MEANDER ITS WAY NORTHWARD AS A
WARM FRONT. THERE IS A FAIR AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY SOUTH OF THE
FRONT AND THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF SHEAR NORTH OF THE FRONT. BOTH
MODELS SHOWING A PIECE OF ENERGY MOVING UP THROUGH NORTHEAST
MISSISSIPPI RESULTING IN HIGHER RAIN CHANCES THERE.
ELSEWHERE...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE
WITH THE WARM FRONT. SEVERE POTENTIAL IS VERY QUESTIONABLE FOR
TOMORROW SINCE NORTH OF THE FRONT WHERE THE BETTER SHEAR IS
LOCATED THE INSTABILITY IS VERY MUCH HINDERED DUE TO A SHARP
TEMPERATURE INVERSION AT 925MB. IF A THUNDERSTORM COULD MANAGE TO
DEVELOP RIGHT ALONG THE FRONT...THERE JUST MIGHT BE ENOUGH OF THE
INSTABILITY AND SHEAR FOR ISOLATED TORNADO THREAT. 

TOMORROW NIGHT THE WARM FRONT CONTINUES MOVING NORTH OF THE AREA.
RAIN CHANCES CONTINUE WITH THE WARM FRONT AROUND. A STRONG COLD
FRONT WILL APPROACH THE REGION LATE TOMORROW NIGHT. ALTHOUGH THE
FRONT IS NOT EXPECTED TO ARRIVE NOW UNTIL AFTER 12Z...BETTER RAIN
CHANCES EXIST OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN THE
TIMING OF THE FRONT.

TUESDAY...STRONG COLD FRONT PLOWS INTO THE REGION. THIS WOULD
LIKELY BE A CLEAR CUT SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK IF THE
INSTABILITY WAS BETTER. THE PROBLEM WITH A POTENTIAL OUTBREAK IS
TOO MUCH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TRANSLATING INTO CLOUD COVER
TRANSLATING INTO LOW INSTABILITY. STILL...GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE
FRONT (+12 850MB TEMPS AHEAD OF FRONT VS -2 BEHIND) AND +100 KT
JET MOVING ACROSS MISSOURI...THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK THAT THE
DYNAMICS MAY OVERCOME THE INSTABILITY. THERE IS CERTAINLY A
STRAIGHT LINE WIND THREAT DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE UPPER LEVER
LEVEL WINDS. HELICITY VALUES ARE OVER 150 M2/S2 SO THERE IS ALSO A
TORNADO THREAT. ONCE AGAIN...INSTABILITY THE KEY HERE.

RAIN CHANCES CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY NIGHT DUE TO FRONT TIMING. COLD
DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE AREA WITH 850 TEMPS
AROUND -2 OVER THE REGION. A WIDESPREAD FREEZE IS POSSIBLE AROUND
MID WEEK AS THE HIGH BECOMES CENTERED OVER THE AREA. GFS IS NOT
CONSISTENT TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK WITH TODAYS SOLUTION
ADVERTISING A PAIR OF CLIPPER SYSTEMS MOVING THROUGH THE REGION
WHEREAS YESTERDAYS RUN SHOWED HIGH PRESSURE FIRMLY IN CONTROL.
WILL CONTINUE WITH CURRENT FORECAST OF COOL DRY WEATHER UNTIL THE
MODELS SHOW A BIT MORE CONSISTENCY IN THE EXTENDED.

A BROAD LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WAS MOVING ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH EARLY THIS MORNING. AIRMASS FAIRLY STABLE ACRS THE AREA THOUGH 
LOW LEVEL WINDS ARE QUITE STRONG...40-50 KTS AT 3KFT ON THE KNQA 88D 
WIND PROFILE...RESULTING IN SOME GUSTY SFC WINDS WITH SOME OF THESE 
TSTMS. KNQA REPORTED A GUST TO 37 MPH RECENTLY.

TODAY AND TONIGHT...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MOST NUMEROUS
ACROSS SE HALF OF THE AREA AS A COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVES THROUGH
THE AREA. SOME DRIER AIR WILL TRY TO WORK INTO NRN SXNS LATER
TODAY AND THE SUN MAY BREAK OUT IN THOSE AREAS. THE FRONT WL STALL 
ACRS NRN MS LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT. BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIP TONIGHT 
WL BE ACRS NRN MS WITH LESSER CHANCES TO THE NORTH.

MONDAY...THE STALLED FRONT WILL MOVE NORTHWARD ON MON AS A WARM 
FRONT. BY MON AFTN THE FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED FROM NRN AR EASTWARD
TO W TN. SFC DEWPOINTS WL CLIMB TO THE LOWER 60S SOUTH OF THE FRONT 
WITH DECENT INSTABILITY FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. SBCAPES SHOULD BE 
GREATER THAN 1000 J/KG AND SFC LIFTED INDICES AROUND -2C. IN THIS 
SCENARIO STRONG VEERING WOULD BE PRESENT ALONG THE WARM FRONT WITH 
HELICITIES IN THE 200-400 M2/S2 RANGE. GFS AND ETA BOTH IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THIS WARM FRONT...THOUGH THE ETA IS A LITTLE FURTHER 
NORTH AT 00Z TUE. MODELS DEPICT A SHORTWAVE ACRS KS/MO THAT MAY 
PROVIDE THE LIFT NEEDED TO TRIGGER TSTMS AND POSSIBLY SUPERCELL 
STORMS. IF STORMS ARE ABLE TO DEVELOP THEN DAMAGING WIND...HAIL AND 
TORNADOES ARE POSSIBLE...MAINLY ACRS NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE MID 
SOUTH MON AFTN INTO MON EVENING.

MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...WARM FRONT WL SHIFT NORTH OF THE AREA
MON NIGHT AS A STRONG UPPER TROF DIVES INTO THE CNTRL PLAINS.
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WL DEVELOP ACRS THE SRN PLAINS AND MOVE TO
SE MO BY 12Z TUE. A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP
ALONG AND IN ADVANCE OF THE ASSOCD COLD FRONT LOCATED FROM THE
SFC LOW SOUTHWESTWARD INTO THE ARKLATEX BY 12Z TUE. THIS LINE OF
THUNDERSTORMS WILL SWEEP ACRS THE MID SOUTH ON TUE. 00Z AND 06Z
ETA/GFS MODEL RUNS ARE IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS 
SYSTEM. THEY ARE ALSO A LITTLE SLOWER WITH MOVING THIS SYSTEM THROUGH
THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. SEVERE WEATHER ALSO APPEARS POSSIBLE AS THIS 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH. AIRMASS DESTABILIZES IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT ON 
TUE. SBCAPES OF 500-1000 J/KG...SFC DEWPOINTS 60-65F AND VERY STRONG 
UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND FIELDS POINT TO A SQUALL LINE WITH DAMAGING 
WINDS AS THE GREATEST THREAT FOLLOWED BY HAIL.

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WL LEAVE SOME LINGERING
SHOWERS ACRS NE MS THROUGH MIDNIGHT OTHERWISE HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDING ACRS THE REGION WITH MUCH COOLER AIR RUSHING IN AND TEMPS
DROPPING INTO THE 30S MOST PLACES. WEDNESDAY WL BE QUITE FALL LIKE
WITH BRISK NORTHWEST WINDS AND HIGH TEMPS IN THE LOWER AND MID
50S. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS DIRECTLY OVER THE MID SOUTH WEDNESDAY
NIGHT AND THIS WL RESULT IN A WIDESPREAD FREEZE.

MON NIGHT AS A STRONG UPPER TROF DIVES INTO THE CNTRL PLAINS.
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WL DEVELOP ACRS THE SRN PLAINS AND MOVE TO
SE MO BY 12Z TUE. A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP
ALONG AND IN ADVANCE OF THE ASSOCD COLD FRONT LOCATED FROM THE
SFC LOW SOUTHWESTWARD INTO THE ARKLATEX BY 12Z TUE. THIS LINE OF
THUNDERSTORMS WILL SWEEP ACRS THE MID SOUTH ON TUE. 00Z AND 06Z
ETA/GFS MODEL RUNS ARE IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THIS
SYSTEM. THERE ARE ALSO A LITTLE SLOWER MOVING THIS SYSTEM THROUGH
THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. SEVERE WEATHER ALSO APPEARS POSSIBLE AS THIS
FRONT MOVES THOUGH. AIRMASS DESTABILIZES IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT
ON TUE. SBCAPES OF 500-1000 J/KG...SFC DEWPOINTS 60-65F AND VERY
STRONG UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND FIELDS POINT TO A SQUALL LINE WITH
DAMAGING WINDS AS THE GREATEST THREAT FOLLOWED BY HAIL.

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WL LEAVE SOME LINGERING
SHOWERS ACRS NE MS THROUGH MIDNIGHT OTHERWISE HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDING ACRS THE REGION WITH MUCH COOLER AIR RUSHING IN AND TEMPS
DROPPING INTO THE 30S MOST PLACES. WEDNESDAY WL BE QUITE FALL LIKE
WITH BRISK NORTHWEST WINDS AND HIGH TEMPS IN THE LOWER AND MID
50S. HIGH PRESSURE BUILD DIRECTLY OVER THE MID SOUTH WEDNESDAY

.DISCUSSION...2Z SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS EVENING PLACES CENTER OF LOW 
PRESSURE ACROSS DES MOINES IOWA WITH A SURFACE COLD FRONT EXTENDING 
SOUTH INTO EASTERN KANSAS/WESTERN MISSOURI. A DRYLINE EXTENDS FURTHER 
SOUTHWARD ACROSS EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS. SO FAR LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE HAS BEEN CONFINED MAINLY TO WESTERN MISSOURI AND THE 
WESTERN HALF OF ARKANSAS THUS FAR WITH DEWPOINTS ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH STILL IN THE 30S AND 40S. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN OVERNIGHT IS 
CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL. 

NEARLY UNIDIRECTIONAL 35 KT 850 MB WINDS AND 50 KT 500 MB WINDS 
ALONG WITH 10C 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS SUPPORT LINEAR 
ORGANIZATION WITH CONVECTION TONIGHT...AS REGIONAL WSR-88D RADAR 
TRENDS ALREADY SUGGEST. SHORT TERM LAPS ANALYSIS SHOW ATMOSPHERE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SLOWLY BEGINNING TO DESTABILIZE AS MODERATE 
/6.5 C/KM 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES SLOWLY WORK EAST ACROSS 
ARKANSAS. IN ADDITION...LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE TRENDS OVER THE 
PAST HOUR SHOW CONVECTIVE CLOUD TOPS WARMING ACROSS WESTERN 
ARKANSAS...A SIGN OF WEAKENING CONVECTION. NOT ANTICIPATING ANY 
SEVERE WEATHER OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS UPSTREAM 
CONVECTION ARRIVES. FORECAST GRIDS ON TRACK OVERALL...BUT WILL ISSUE 
AN UPDATE TO MAKE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS.  

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY.

CJC

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 247 PM CST SAT NOV 12 2005...

SATELLITE SHOWS CLOUDS OVER ARKANSAS SLOWLY MOVING EASTWARD. THESE
CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY OVERTAKE MUCH OF THE REGION THIS EVENING.
RADAR HAS DETECTED A FEW ECHOS OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS. AT MOST THIS
IS SPRINKLES IF IT IS REACHING THE SURFACE AT ALL GIVEN THE DRY
LOW LEVELS. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN THE MODELS. EXPECT
PRECIPITATION TO BREAK OUT OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS LATE THIS EVENING
AS THE 850MB FRONT MOVES INTO THE REGION. THE SURFACE FRONT WILL
BE LAGGING BEHIND. SEVERE POTENTIAL CONTINUE TO LOOK LOW BECAUSE
THE UPPER DYNAMICS ARE NOT IN PHASE WITH THE SURFACE FEATURE AND
INSTABILITY IS LOW. GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE WIND AHEAD OF THE
FRONT...A FEW STRONGER WIND GUSTS UP TO AROUND 35 OR 40 MPH ARE
POSSIBLE ACROSS EASTERN ARKANSAS TONIGHT AS THE CONVECTION
APPROACHES. CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL LINGER INTO SUNDAY AS THE FRONT
MOVES THROUGH THE REGION WITH THE SURFACE FRONT STALLING ACROSS
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. RAIN CHANCES WILL PERSIST ACROSS MUCH OF NORTHERN
MISSISSIPPI DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WITH THE STALLING OF THE FRONT AND
WAVES MOVING ALONG THE FRONT. ALTHOUGH SOME CLEARING IS POSSIBLE
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY EVENING...BOTH GFS/ETA SHOW MOISTURE
AT 850MB SURGING BACK NORTHWARD SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT BEGINS
TO MOVE NORTH. 

THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH AND WELL NORTH OF THE REGION ON
MONDAY. HAVE RAISED RAIN CHANCES ON MONDAY SINCE THE FRONT MAY
FIRE A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM OFF AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION.
BOTH NAM AND GFS KEY ON AN UPPER LEVEL FEATURE MOVING OUT OF
LOUISIANA MONDAY MORNING AND MOVING THROUGH NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI
DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. THUS...HIGHER RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THIS
AREA. WITH BOTH MODELS SHOWING AN ABUNDANT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE
AROUND AT 850MB...AGREE WITH GUIDANCE THAT IT MAY BE MAINLY
CLOUDY. 

GOOD CHANCES FOR RAIN MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS A STRONG COLD
FRONT DROPS SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE REGION. SEVERE POTENTIAL
REMAINS MARGINAL AT THIS POINT WITH THE BIG QUESTION INVOLVING
INSTABILITY. A 120KT JET WILL BE RACING ACROSS MISSOURI AND INTO
THE OHIO VALLEY AT THIS TIME WHICH MAY PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIFT.
NAM AND GFS 0-3KM HELICITY VALUES ARE ABOVE 150 M2/S2. TOO EARLY
TO GET TOO CONCERNED ABOUT THE SITUATION BUT CERTAINLY SOMETHING TO
KEEP AN EYE ON. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE AREA BY 00Z
WEDNESDAY. 850MB TEMPS BY 12Z WEDNESDAY COULD BE AS LOW AS -4
ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE REGION. TO FURTHER HIGHLIGHT THE STRENGTH
OF THE FRONT...850 TEMPS 12Z TUESDAY ARE PROJECTED TO BE +12.

BELOW NORMAL CONDITIONS AND DRY WEATHER ARE FORECASTED FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE WEEK AS CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE
AREA. FREEZING TEMPERATURES ARE POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN AROUND MID WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...

REGIONAL RADAR SHOWS A THIN LINE OF SHOWERS ORIENTED NORTH TO
SOUTH ACROSS CENTRAL ARKANSAS MOVING SLOWLY EASTWARD. DEW POINTS
ARE EXTREMELY LOW ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. AS A RESULT...EXPECT THAT
VERY LITTLE IF ANY RAIN WOULD OCCUR. STILL...SLIGHT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS CANT BE ENTIRELY RULED OUT FROM ROUGHLY THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER WESTWARD THIS AFTERNOON. OTHERWISE...FORECAST IS PRETTY MUCH
ON TRACK. SHOULD SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER ACROSS EASTERN
ARKANSAS INTO EXTREME WEST TN AND NORTHWEST MS THIS AFTERNOON.
HIGH TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE. SEVERE POTENTIAL FOR THIS AFTERNOON
AND TONIGHT LOOKS RATHER MARGINAL. INSTABILITY IS REAL LOW. WINDS
ARE FAIRLY STRONG OFF THE SURFACE WHICH IS REALLY THE ONLY
POSSIBLE THREAT. POSSIBLY MIXING DOWN SOME STRONGER WIND GUSTS
TONIGHT...BUT ONCE AGAIN LIKELY VERY ISOLATED IF AT ALL.

CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE WAS
LOCATED ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST U.S. LARGE TEMPERATURES RANGES ACROSS
THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING. SOME EASTERN SECTIONS DECOUPLED AND
WENT CALM AND TEMPS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE 30S. MEANWHILE LIGHT
SOUTHERLY WINDS WERE KEEPING MEMPHIS TEMPS AROUND 50. 

TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WL CONT TO SLIP EAST TODAY BUT 
NOT BEFORE ANOTHER NICE DAY ACROSS THE REGION. EXPECT TEMPS IN THE
LOWER 70S WITH INCREASING CLOUDS ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS.
DEWPOINTS WL START TO RISE ACRS THE AREA...ESPECIALLY ERN AR/MO
BOOTHEEL THIS AFTN. A 500 MB SHORTWAVE MOVES FROM THE ROCKIES
INTO THE MS VALLEY BY LATE THIS AFTN AND TONIGHT PROVIDING SOME
LIFT ACRS THE SRN PLAINS. EXPECT A LINE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG THE INSTABILITY AXIS IN ADVANCE OF
THE SFC DRYLINE/COLD FRONT ACRS ERN OK LATER TODAY INTO THIS
EVENING AND MOVE ACROSS ARKANSAS TONIGHT. THIS LINE WL BE
WEAKENING AS IT MOVES EAST SINCE UPPER SUPPORT WL BE RACING
NORTHEAST AND INSTABILITY WL BE DECREASING. A FEW STORMS ACRS ERN
AR MAY BE STRONG TONIGHT WITH SOME SMALL HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS.
EXPECT MILD TEMPS ACRS THE REGION TONIGHT WITH READINGS MAINLY IN
THE 50S. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WL MOVE ACRS THE REGION TONIGHT
AND SUNDAY WITH THE FRONT STALLING OUT JUST SOUTH OF THE FORECAST
AREA SUNDAY NIGHT. A LITTLE COOLER ON SUNDAY WITH CLOUDS AND
PRECIP.

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...FRONT STALLED JUST TO OUR SOUTH ON
SUNDAY NIGHT WITH SMALL CHANCES FOR PRECIP ACRS PARTS OF NORTH MS.
COOLER AIR BRUSHES NORTHERN SECTIONS SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT
SURGES BACK NORTH ON MONDAY AS A WARM FRONT WITH SMALL CHANCE OF
PRECIP AREAWIDE AND DEWPOINTS CLIMBING ABOVE 60F. 

MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...STRONG SHORTWAVE DIVES INTO THE MID MS
VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT WITH ASSOCD COLD FRONT PLOWING THROUGH THE
MID SOUTH MON NIGHT AND TUE. MOIST AND SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE AIRMASS
IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT SO THERE ARE SOME SEVERE WEATHER CONCERNS.
MUCH COOLER AIRMASS WL BE USHERED IN BEHIND THE FRONT.

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...COOL HIGH PRESSURE WL BUILD ACRS
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TUE NIGHT AND MOVE DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA BY
12Z THU. THERE IS A CHANCE OF A WIDESPREAD FREEZE THU MORNING. A
DRY COLD FRONT WL PUSH THROUGH THU NIGHT WITH A REINFORCING SHOT OF

AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM EASTERN KENTUCKY THROUGH
NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI. THE HIGH WILL MOVE EASTWARD TONIGHT AS THE
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE SHIFTS EASTWARD AND A SHORTWAVE TROUGH ADVANCES
INTO THE PLAINS OVERNIGHT. LOOKING AT MAINLY CLEAR SKIES WITH ONLY
A FEW CIRRUS DRIFTING THROUGH THE REGION ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT. DEW
POINTS ARE EVEN LOWER THIS AFTERNOON WITH SEVERAL STATIONS OVER
WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS REPORTED DEW POINTS IN THE TEENS.
HOWEVER...THE GRADIENT SHOULD INCREASE DURING THE EVENING WHICH
SHOULD ALLOW WINDS TO REMAIN UP A LITTLE OVERNIGHT. AS A
RESULT...DO NOT EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO APPROACH FREEZING POINT
TONIGHT. 

EXPECT PERIODS OF CLOUDS TOMORROW ASSOCIATED WITH A DEW POINT
SURGE AHEAD OF THE NEXT SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. DEW
POINTS OVER THE MID SOUTH WILL START IN THE 30S IN THE MORNING BUT
WILL CLIMB INTO THE 40S WITH 50 DEW POINTS OVER MUCH OF ARKANSAS
BY SUNSET. RAIN WILL LIKELY HOLD OFF UNTIL THE LATER IN THE
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT. ETA IS A FEW HOURS SLOWER THAN
THE GFS IN BRINGING RAIN INTO THE REGION. THE GFS DEVELOPS THE
PRECIPITATION AHEAD OF THE FRONT IN THE VICINITY OF THE UPPER
LEVEL SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE REGION WHEREAS THE ETA HOLDS
PRECIP BACK CLOSER TO THE FRONT YET STILL JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT.
EITHER CASE...EXPECT MOST AREAS TO SEE MEASURABLE RAIN EITHER
TOMORROW NIGHT OR SUNDAY MORNING. THERE MAY BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY
AROUND FOR A FEW CLAPS OF THUNDER BUT AM NOT EXPECTING SEVERE
WEATHER BECAUSE THE UPPER LEVEL FEATURES ARE OUTRUNNING THE
SURFACE FRONT. RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE UNCERTAIN AND WILL LARGELY
DEPEND UPON JUST HOW STRONG THE LIFT WITH THE UPPER JET IS AND HOW
MUCH MOISTURE ADVECTS INTO THE AREA. BROAD ESTIMATE WOULD BE A
QUARTER TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH. THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE EXITING
THE REGION AROUND 00Z ON SUNDAY WITH THE FRONT EVENTUALLY STALLING
OUT JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA. WILL LINGER POPS ACROSS THE REGION
SUNDAY NIGHT DUE TO TIMING UNCERTAINTIES. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO
SURGE BACK NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT ON MONDAY AS ANOTHER LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM ENTERS THE PLAINS. LOW CHANCES FOR RAIN ON MONDAY
DUE TO LOW MOISTURE AND WEAK UPPER DYNAMICS. 

THE GFS SHOWS THE NEXT FRONT MOVING INTO THE AREA LATE MONDAY
NIGHT AND THROUGH THE AREA TUESDAY AFTERNOON WITH PRECIPITATION
DEVELOPING OVER THE REGION AND ALONG THE FRONT AS A 120KT UPPER
JET STREAK RACES ACROSS MISSOURI AND INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. SEVERE
POTENTIAL STILL UNCERTAIN BUT HAVE CONCERNS ABOUT THE QUICK TURN
AROUND BETWEEN SYSTEM WITH REGARDS TO MOISTURE RETURN AND
INSTABILITY. THE GFS AND EUROPEAN SHOW ANOTHER COLD SHOT ABOUT 6
HOURS BEHIND THE SURFACE FRONT MOVING INTO THE REGION. 850 TEMPS
BY 12Z WEDNESDAY OVER MEMPHIS ARE AROUND -2. WOULDNT BE SURPRISED
IF HIGH TEMPS OCCUR IN THE MORNING ON TUESDAY WITH STRONG COLD AIR
ADVECTION TAKING PLACE DURING THE DAY. TEMPERATURES FOR WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY HAVE ADJUSTED DOWN A COUPLE DEGREES BUT IF CURRENT
FORECASTS HOLDS...HIGHS MAY NEED TO BE LOWERED AN ADDITIONAL FIVE
DEGREES OR SO. DRY WEATHER AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE
ANTICIPATED FOR THE REMAINDER OF NEXT WEEK AS CANADIAN HIGH

THE CENTER OF HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS
THIS AFTERNOON. DEW POINTS ARE EXTREMELY DRY (MID 20S) OVER MUCH
OF THE AREA. THIS IS NOTICEABLY DRIER THAN GUIDANCE. SATELLITE
SHOWS MAINLY CLEAR SKIES OVER THE REGION. THERE IS NOTED A THIN
VEIL OF CIRRUS MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS WESTERN MISSOURI AND
INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS. EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL CONDITIONS ARE IN
PLACE FOR TONIGHT WITH THE ONLY FLAW BEING THE CIRRUS. THE GFS
SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE DEPICTING MOISTURE AT THE 200MB LEVEL.
THIS MOISTURE DOES MOVE INTO EASTERN ARKANSAS AND JUST INTO WEST
TENNESSEE OVERNIGHT. THIS MAY KEEP TEMPERATURES UP JUST ABOVE THE
FREEZING POINT OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS INTO NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI.
RAINFALL AMOUNTS YESTERDAY WERE RELATIVELY UNIMPRESSIVE. GIVEN
THIS AFTERNOONS CONDITIONS THE SOIL IS PROBABLY DRY ALREADY. WILL ISSUE
A FREEZE WARNING EAST OF THESE AREA. AM REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT
FREEZING TEMPERATURES WILL BE REACHED IN THE WARNING AREA. HEAT
ISLAND EFFECT WILL LIKELY BE EXTREMELY NOTICEABLY TONIGHT. DURING
THE MOST RECENT OUTBREAK THERE WAS ABOUT A 5-7 DEGREE SPREAD FROM
THE AIRPORT TO THE NWS...IN EXTREME EASTERN AND NORTHERN SHELBY
COUNTY THE SPREAD WAS AS MUCH AS 12 DEGREES. WITH THE DRY AIR IN
PLACE...EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO PLUMMET DURING THE EVENING.

SURFACE WINDS SHOULD TURN AROUND TO THE SOUTH TOMORROW WITH
EXCELLENT WARM AIR ADVECTION NOTED AT 850MB. 850 TEMPS WILL
APPROACH +12. WILL LIKELY NOT MIX UP TO 850 BECAUSE OF THE COLD
START BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL SUPPORT UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70.
ENOUGH OF A GRADIENT EXISTS TOMORROW NIGHT THAT TEMPERATURES
SHOULD REMAIN WELL ABOVE FREEZING.

THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN IS SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.
EUROPEAN/GFS/ETA ALL SHOW THE FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE REGION
ALTHOUGH THE ETA IS SLOWER IN PASSAGE THAN THE EUROPEAN/GFS. ALL
MODELS SUPPORTIVE OF GOOD RAIN CHANCES WITH THE FRONT SINCE
MOISTURE SHOULD RISE NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF WITH HIGH PRESSURE
POSITIONED OVER THE CAROLINAS. LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE ABOUT A
24-48 HOUR BREAK IN BETWEEN SYSTEMS. THE GFS BRING A SECONDARY
FRONT IN FROM THE NORTHWEST. THE GFS HAS NOT BEEN CONSISTENT ON
THE TIMING OF THE FRONT BUT BEST GUESS IS THAT PASSAGE WILL BE
AROUND TUESDAY. GLANCING AT MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND SFC BASED
CAPES THERE APPEARS TO BE JUST ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO SUPPORT
THUNDER WITH BOTH SYSTEMS. NO SEVERE POTENTIAL WITH THE FIRST
SYSTEM AND TOO EARLY TO REALLY TELL WITH THE SECOND SYSTEM.

HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER CENTRAL MISSOURI WILL CONTINUE TO
BUILD SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. SATELLITE
SHOWS JUST A FEW CIRRUS DRIFTING THROUGH THE REGION. TEMPERATURES
ARE RUNNING CLOSE TO THE MET GUIDANCE. TOGETHER WITH MORNING
TRENDS...RAISED TEMPS ACROSS SOUTHWEST TN...EAST CENTRAL AR AND
NORTH MS. LOWER 60S STILL LOOK REASONABLE ACROSS NORTHWEST TN INTO
NORTHEAST AR. THE CENTER OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVER THE
MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. DEW POINTS ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING IN THE MID TO
UPPER 20S...WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO GO LIGHT AND SKIES CLEAR. TEMPS
TONIGHT SHOULD DROP INTO THE MID 30S AT LEAST POSSIBLY INTO THE
20S ACROSS MUCH OF WEST TN AND EXTREME NORTH MS. 850MB TEMPS ARE
STILL WARM (AROUND +8) WHICH WOULDNT NORMALLY SUPPORT SUCH COLD
TEMPS. AS A RESULT AM CONCERNED ABOUT UNDERCUTTING GUIDANCE TOO
MUCH. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR TRENDS THIS AFTERNOON...BUT FREEZE
WARNING LOOKS VERY LIKELY TONIGHT ACROSS MUCH OF WEST TN AND MOST

COLD FRONT WELL SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. SKIES
HAVE BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR WITH ONLY SOME CIRRUS MOVING THROUGH THE
REGION. HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN KANSAS THIS MORNING.
SKIES SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR THROUGH SATURDAY AS HIGH MOVES
SLOWLY EAST. WITH CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS TONIGHT...TEMPERATURES
WILL APPROACH FREEZING MARK OVER NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF FORECAST AREA.
AS HIGH BEGINS TO MOVE EAST OF FORECAST AREA FRIDAY...WINDS WILL
BEGIN TO SHIFT TO THE SOUTH AND HELP WARM THINGS UP A LITTLE. NEXT
COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY
BRINGING SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF IT. AS WITH THE LAST FRONT
THE MAIN DYNAMICS SHOULD REMAIN WELL TO THE NORTH SO NOT EXPECTING
MUCH IN THE WAY OF SEVERE WEATHER. THIS FRONT IS EXPECTED TO STALL
JUST TO OUR SOUTH SO EXPECT A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHERN
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. ANOTHER FRONT
MOVES THROUGH THE REGION TUESDAY BUT WITH LIMITED MOISTURE TO WORK

.SYNOPSIS...
COLD FRONT MOVING INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI 
BOOTHEEL.  ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED ALONG THE FRONT. SO FAR 
TUPELO HAS SET A RECORD HIGH AND THE RECORD AT JACKSON WAS TIED.  
CLOUD COVER IS HELPING TO KEEP READINGS A TAD LOWER THAN EXPECTED.  

&&

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...
THE TREND OF ISOLATED SHOWERS ALONG THE FRONT IS EXPECTED THROUGH 
MIDNIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT PICKS UP STEAM AND HEADS INTO CENTRAL 
MISSISSIPPI.  SHORTWAVE WELL NORTH OF THE REGION SO INSTABILITY IN 
OUR AREA WEAK.  THIS SHOULD LIMIT ANY SEVERE WEATHER AND KEEP 
THUNDER TO A MINIMUM.

AFTER TONIGHT EXPECT HIGH PRESSURE TO DOMINATE THROUGH SATURDAY 
MORNING.  HAVE ADJUSTED NIGHT TIME LOW TEMPERATURES TO ACCOMADATE 
THE USUAL HEAT ISLANDS AND COLD POCKETS.  CONDITIONS SHOULD GET 
FROSTY FRIDAY NIGHT FOR MUCH OF WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI. NO ADVISORIES PLANNED FOR THAT AREA AS TEMPERATURES 
HAVE REACHED THE LOWER 30S AND UPPER 20S ALREADY THIS SEASON.  

.LONGER TERM...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
STRONG SHORT WAVE OVER CA COAST WILL EJECT INTO THE PLAINS. THIS 
WILL HELP BRING RETURN FLOW AND SFC MOISTURE BACK INTO THE 
REGION. MEANWHILE ANOTHER STRONG SHORTWAVE IN THE NORTHERN STREAM 
WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT INTO OUR REGION SATURDAY NIGHT.  AS THE TWO 
SYSTEMS INTERACT RAINFALL IS QUITE POSSIBLE SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY.  HAVE LEFT OUT THUNDER FOR NOW AS IT APPEARS INSTABILITY A 
LITTLE WEAK.

ECMWF AND GFS NOW AGREE THAT FLOW WILL BECOME MORE NORTHWEST THROUGH 
DAY 7.  THIS WILL ALLOW FOR MORE NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND PERIODIC 
FRONTAL PASSAGES.  THE NEXT FRONT IS EXPECTED TUESDAY NIGHT.

COLD FRONT LOCATED FROM CENTRAL WISCONSIN THROUGH NORTHERN MISSOURI
INTO NORTHERN OKLAHOMA THIS MORNING. VERY LITTLE RAIN ASSOCIATED
WITH THE FRONT RIGHT NOW. IF ANY THUNDERSTORMS DO DEVELOP AHEAD OF
THE FRONT...THEY WOULD NOT MAKE OUR FORECAST AREA UNTIL AFTERNOON AT
THE EARLIEST SO KEPT MORNING HOURS DRY AND WENT WITH SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.

TEMPERATURES HAVE NOT FALLEN A LOT OVERNIGHT AND REMAIN IN THE MID
60S TO NEAR 70. NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION TO SEE TEMPERATURES WARM UP
TO THE UPPER 70S TO NEAR 80 BY THIS AFTERNOON WHICH PUTS HIGHS
WITHIN A DEGREE OR TWO OF RECORDS AT ALL OF OUR SITES SO WILL
MENTION NEAR RECORD HIGHS FOR TODAY.

COOLER AIR WILL FILTER IN BEHIND THE FRONT ON THURSDAY WITH HIGHS
SOME 10-20 DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY. BY FRIDAY MORNING...CLEAR
SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL HELP TEMPERATURES DROP QUITE A BIT. SOME
SECTIONS OF NORTHWEST TENNESSEE MAY SEE READINGS AT OR SLIGHTLY
BELOW FREEZING.

NEXT COLD FRONT APPROACHES REGION BY SATURDAY NIGHT BRINGING ANOTHER
CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEKEND. THIS FRONT MAY
HANG AROUND UNTIL MONDAY SO HAVE KEPT RAIN CHANCE IN FOR MONDAY AS

HAVE DECIDED TO MAKE ANOTHER QUICK FORECAST UPDATE TO RAISE
TEMPERATURES A FEW MORE DEGREES ACROSS CENTRAL AND WESTERN AREAS.
CURRENT TEMPERATURE FORECAST FOR EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST
AREA LOOKS FINE FOR NOW...SO LEFT THESE AREAS ALONE. WARM ADVECTION
AND MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM THE SOUTHWEST APPEARS TO BE A BIT
STRONGER THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST...SO THIS WILL PREVENT
TEMPERATURES FROM DROPPING TOO MUCH TONIGHT. ALSO WILL GO PARTLY
CLOUDY EVERYWHERE...AS MID AND HIGH CLOUDS MOVE ACROSS THE AREA.
MAY ALSO BE SOME PATCHY LOWER CLOUDS DEVELOP OVER AREAS WEST OF
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AS MID 60S DEWPOINTS ADVECT INTO THE AREA.
CLOUDS WILL ALSO HELP KEEP TEMPS HIGHER.

UPDATED ZONES AND GRIDS WILL BE OUT SHORTLY TO REFLECT THESE
CHANGES.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL OF THE WEATHER OVER THE
MID-SOUTH TONIGHT. THIS HIGH IS NOW SITUATED TO OUR EAST AND HAS
ALLOWED RETURN SOUTHERLY FLOW TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA. SOME
WARM ADVECTION ALONG WITH MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM THE SOUTHWEST
LATE TONIGHT WILL ADVECT LOW TO MID 60 DEWPOINTS INTO OUR AREA
INTO THE DAY WEDNESDAY. THIS INCREASED LOW LEVEL HUMIDITY AND HIGH
CLOUD COVER STREAMING IN FROM THE WEST WILL KEEP LOW TEMPERATURES
HIGHER...ESPECIALLY FOR THE WESTERN HALF OF THE REGION.
THEREFORE...HAVE BUMPED TEMPS UP JUST A FEW DEGREES OVER THESE

RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES WERE REACHED IN THE MIDSOUTH THIS

SEVERE WEATHER. MORE CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL HELP KEEP
TEMPERATURES FROM GETTING NEARLY AS WARM ON WEDNESDAY BUT STILL WILL
BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL. FRONT SHOULD BE THROUGH MUCH OF THE REGION BY

SEE A THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY MORNING. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE QUITE A

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS EVENING
AND WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE TONIGHT. THE
COLD FRONT THAT MOVED ACROSS THE AREA LAST NIGHT HAS STALLED
ACROSS CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. MUCH LOWER DEWPOINTS HAVE FILTERED
INTO THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE AREA. OVER THE SOUTHERN ONE-
THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA...HIGHER DEWPOINTS EXIST AND THIS
COMBINED WITH LIGHT WINDS AND MOIST CONDITIONS FROM LAST NIGHTS
STORMS...EXPECT PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP. ELSEWHERE LIGHT
WINDS...MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES...AND LOW DEWPOINTS WILL PROVIDE FOR A
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING SITUATION. OVER THESE AREAS...HAVE
LOWERED TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES TO ACCOUNT FOR RADIATIONAL
COOLING AND TO REFLECT CURRENT TEMPERATURE TRENDS. HIGH CLOUDS MAY
MOVE INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST LATE TONIGHT AND THIS MAY
HELP TO KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM BOTTOMING OUT EVEN FURTHER. ALL IN
ALL IT LOOKS LIKE A RATHER QUIET WEATHER NIGHT. OTHER THAN
TEMPERATURES...THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK.

MISSISSIPPI BETWEEN GREENWOOD AND JUST SOUTH OF TUPELO. THIS FRONT 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA

A VERY BUSY MORNING CONTINUES ACROSS THE MEMPHIS FORECAST AREA.
A BROKEN LINE OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO MOVE
ACROSS PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI AHEAD OF
AN ADVANCING COLD FRONT THAT IS BEING FORCED SOUTHEAST BY A
VIGOROUS SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE AREA. WIND FIELDS AND
ATMOSPHERIC SHEAR REMAIN STRONG AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND LOW LEVEL
HELICITIES CONTINUE TO INCREASE...CONTINUING THE THREAT OF SEVERE
WEATHER...INCLUDING THE LIKELIHOOD OF A FEW MORE DAMAGING WIND
EVENTS BEFORE SUNRISE EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. CANNOT RULE OUT
AN ISOLATED TORNADO AS WELL. THIS WEATHER SYSTEM SHOULD SWEEP EAST
OF THE REGION ON SUNDAY. HAVE KEPT SOME LINGERING SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS ACROSS SOUTHEAST AREAS...AS THESE AREAS MAY HAVE TO WAIT
UNTIL AFTER 12Z FOR FRONTAL PASSAGE. ONCE THE FRONT SWEEPS THROUGH
SKIES WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR. DEWPOINTS WILL BE LOWER BEHIND THE
FRONT...BUT EXPECT ONLY SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES...BUT STILL
ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR THE END OF THE
WEEKEND AND LINGER THROUGH THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEK. THE UPPER
FLOW WILL BECOME ZONAL THROUGH MONDAY AND THEN EXPECT BROAD UPPER
LEVEL RIDGING THROUGH MID WEEK. THIS MEANS MORE DRY WEATHER AND
TEMPERATURES MORE CHARACTERISTIC OF EARLY FALL RATHER THAN
NOVEMBER. THE RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN TOWARDS THE LATER
PART OF THE WEEK AS THE NEXT SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD
FRONT SKIRT CLOSER TO THE AREA. MODELS HAVE NOT BEEN CONSISTENT WITH
THIS NEXT FEATURE...SO CONFIDENCE IN FRONTAL LOCATION IS BELOW
AVERAGE. HAVE DECIDED TO TREND TEMPERATURES UP A BIT FOR THE
EXTENDED AS THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL BE OF PACIFIC ORIGIN AND
THERE ARE STILL SOME QUESTIONS AS TO WHETHER IT COMPLETELY MOVES
ACROSS THE AREA. HAVE KEPT LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE POSSIBILITY
THAT THE FRONT MAY BE IN THE AREA...BUT AGAIN CONFIDENCE QUITE
LOW. AT THIS POINT...IT APPEARS THAT TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN
ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE...WITH BELOW AVERAGE RAIN
CHANCES CONTINUING THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

.UPDATE...

ANOTHER UPDATE TO THE GRIDS AND ZONES TO REFLECT CHANGES TO THE
WATCHES. HAVE CANCELLED COUNTIES WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
FROM SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH 843. ALSO HAVE CANCELLED
LAKE...OBION...AND DYER COUNTIES FROM SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH
844. ALL REMAINING COUNTIES ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE THAT WERE IN
SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH 844 ARE NOW IN TORNADO WATCH 845. IT
APPEARS THAT CONDITIONS ARE BECOMING A BIT MORE FAVORABLE FOR THE
POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED TORNADOES IN EMBEDDED SUPERCELL
THUNDERSTORMS WITHIN THE CURRENT CONVECTIVE LINE MOVING ACROSS
WEST TENNESSEE...THEREFORE SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH 844 HAS BEEN
UPGRADED TO A TORNADO WATCH. 

UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONES HAVE ALREADY BEEN SENT. PLEASE CONTACT THE
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE OFFICE IN MEMPHIS TO REPORT STORM DAMAGE.

CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY ALONG

.UPDATE...

...SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH IN EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM CST FOR PORTIONS
OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL...

LATE UPDATE TONIGHT DUE TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH COORDINATION.
A LINE OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS PUSHING TOWARDS NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS CURRENTLY. THIS LINE OF STORMS HAS DEVELOPED AHEAD OF AN
EASTWARD MOVING COLD FRONT AND SIGNIFICANT NEGATIVELY TILTED
SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES.
THE ATMOSPHERE WILL CONTINUE TO DESTABILIZE OVER MAINLY NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SHORTWAVE.
ALSO...ATMOSPHERIC SHEAR IS SUFFICIENTLY STRONG TO SUPPORT SOME
SEVERE WIND GUSTS IN THE STRONGEST STORMS. ALSO...LOW LEVEL WIND
FIELD IS BACKED ENOUGH AHEAD OF THE FRONT TO POSE AN ISOLATED
THREAT OF A TORNADO IN ANY SUPERCELLS THAT ARE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE
LINE. ALTHOUGH...THIS THREAT SHOULD BE LIMITED WITH DAMAGING
STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS BEING THE PRIMARY THREAT WITH ALSO A LOWER
THREAT OF ISOLATED LARGE HAIL. A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH IS IN
EFFECT UNTIL 4 AM FOR PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS POTENTIAL. SEVERE POTENTIAL
MAY SPREAD FURTHER EAST INTO NORTHWEST TENNESSEE AFTER
MIDNIGHT...BUT WILL NEED TO SEE HOW THIS EVOLVES AS THERE WILL BE
SOME QUESTION TO THE OVERALL AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY OVER THESE
AREAS AS PRIMARY FOCUS OF LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORTWAVE LIFTS
TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE AREA. WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS AREA THOUGH
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT.

UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONES ALREADY SENT. STAY ABREAST OF ANY
ADDITIONAL WATCHES OR SEVERE WEATHER WARNINGS ISSUED THROUGH THE
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS AFTERNOON PLACES LOW PRESSURE 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST MISSOURI WITH A WARM FRONT EXTENDING NORTHEAST ACROSS 
THE NORTHWEST HALF OF MISSOURI AND A DRYLINE SOUTH OF THE LOW. A 
STRONG CAPPING INVERSION ACROSS THE REGION HAS KEPT THE MID SOUTH 
DRY THUS FAR WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 70S TO AROUND 80. WINDS 
HAVE BEEN GUSTY ACROSS A PORTION OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AS SOME 
OF THE 40 KT 850 MB WINDS HAVE MIXED DOWN TO THE SURFACE. MAIN 
FORECAST CONCERN THIS PACKAGE IS SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL TONIGHT. 

TONIGHT...SURFACE LOW CONTINUE TO DEEPEN AND MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS 
MISSOURI TONIGHT. MEANWHILE...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL BECOME 
NEGATIVELY TILTED AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND 
PLACES THE MID SOUTH IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF UPPER LEVEL 
JET. 

40 KT+ 850MB WINDS ALONG WITH 50 KT 500 MB WINDS...CAPES AROUND 1500 
J/KG AND A TONGUE OF 20 C+ 700 MB AIR SUPPORT THE FORMATION OF A 
SQUALL LINE WEST OF THE RIVER LATER THIS EVENING AS STRONG CAPPING 
INVERSION EVENTUALLY WEAKENS AND THE CONVECTION MOVES ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA PRIMARILY AFTER MIDNIGHT. IN ADDITION...0-1KM STORM 
RELATIVE HELICITY VALUES AROUND 350 M2/S2...0-6 KM BULK SHEAR VALUES 
AROUND 50 KTS...AND LCL/S DECREASING BELOW 4000 FT ALSO SUGGEST A 
POSSIBILITY OF SUPERCELLS EMBEDDED WITHIN THE SQUALL LINE. 
HOWEVER...MAIN LIMITING FACTOR WITH THIS CONVECTION MAY BE LOSS OF 
INSTABILITY WITH THE CONVECTION NOT DUE TO ARRIVE UNTIL LATER 
TONIGHT. WILL GO WITH SCATTERED POPS TO THE SOUTH AND LIKELY POPS 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES ALONG AND EAST OF THE MISSOURI 
BOOTHEEL AFTER MIDNIGHT. EVENING SHIFT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR 
PRE-CONVECTIVE TRENDS AND ADJUST FORECAST IF NECESSARY. WILL ALSO 
KEEP A MENTION OF GUSTY WINDS IN THE FORECAST THROUGH EARLY EVENING.

SUNDAY AND BEYOND...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES 
BEHIND THE FRONT WILL NOT BE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN THE PAST FEW DAYS 
AS UPPER LEVEL PATTERN GRADUALLY RETURNS TO SOUTHWEST FLOW BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...LONG RANGE MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
WITH UPPER LEVEL PATTERN ACROSS THE REGION. ONLY DIFFERENCES IS A 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER PROGRESSION OF UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. BOTH GFS/EUROPEAN 
STILL ADVERTISE A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE MID SOUTH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BACK IN ON THURSDAY. KEPT 
TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES ABOVE GUIDANCE AS LONG RANGE GFS CAME IN 
MUCH COOLER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS.

DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING PLACES LOW PRESSURE 
ACROSS CENTRAL OKLAHOMA WITH A QUASI STATIONARY BOUNDARY EXTENDING 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHWEST HALF OF MISSOURI AND A DRYLINE SOUTH 
OF THE LOW. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS AFTERNOON IS WIND AND 
CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL.  

12Z SOUNDING AT KLZK THIS MORNING DEPICTED A 40 KT 850 MB LOW LEVEL 
JET ALONG WITH A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION AT 775 MB. A COUPLE OF 
SPOTS ACROSS THE RED RIVER VALLEY HAVE REPORTED SUSTAINED SURFACE 
WINDS AROUND 22KTS. 700-500 MB LAPSE RATES WILL INCREASE TO 6.5-7.0 
C/KM THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS AREAS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WITH 
SURFACE BASED CAPES AROUND 800 J/KG AND LI/S AROUND -4. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CAPPED OFF 
AT LEAST THROUGH MID AFTERNOON. THINK BEST CHANCE FOR SEEING ANY 
ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING WOULD BE ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHEAST 
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA AND AREAS PRIMARILY WEST OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. IN ADDITION WITH HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE 70S TO 
AROUND 80...WOULDN/T BE SURPRISED TO SEE A FEW GUSTS APPROACHING 30 
KTS THIS AFTERNOON AS SOME OF THE 850 MB WINDS MIX DOWN TO THE SURFACE. 
WILL ISSUE AN UPDATE TO ADJUST FOR CURRENT TRENDS AND MONITOR WIND 
TRENDS THIS AFTERNOON FOR WIND ADVISORY POTENTIAL ACROSS THE DELTA

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY.

SCATTERED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT THIS AFTERNOON AND

NAM SHOWING AN L.I. OF -4 AND CAPES OF 1500 TO 2500 JUST AHEAD OF

STATES SLOWLY MOVES SOUTHEAST. THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT
REMAINS TIGHT THIS EVENING...SO EXPECT SOUTHERLY WINDS TO STAY

WARMED INTO THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 70S. SOME AREAS PRIMARILY ALONG AND 
WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA REPORTING WINDS BELOW ADVISORY 
CRITERIA. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE 
POTENTIAL SATURDAY/SUNDAY AND AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY.

TONIGHT...PRECIPITATION FREE WEATHER EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
WITH THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE OFF TO THE EAST AND A 
COLD FRONT LOCATED ACROSS THE MISSOURI VALLEY AND CENTRAL PLAINS. 
DEWPOINTS HAVE NOT DROPPED MUCH TODAY WITH MID/HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS 
PRESENT AND A STRONG GRADIENT TRANSPORTING GULF MOISTURE UP TO THE 
MID SOUTH. LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL BE IN THE UPPER 50S TO 
LOWER 60S.

SATURDAY...COLD FRONT UPSTREAM ACROSS MISSOURI AND ARKANSAS WILL 
MAKE VERY LITTLE PROGRESS DURING THE DAY ACROSS THE MID/LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL 
INCREASE TO 6.5-7.0 C/KM...WITH LI/S AROUND -5 AND SURFACE BASED 
CAPES BETWEEN 1500-2000 J/KG. ADJUSTED POPS TO LATE 
MORNING/AFTERNOON AS ANY CONVECTION WHICH DEVELOPS WILL 
PRIMARILY BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN.

SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. ANY ONGOING CONVECTION UPSTREAM SHOULD WEAKEN AS 
DIURNAL INSTABILITY DIMINISHES AND WILL BE MOSTLY ELEVATED AND 
REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. RAISED POPS ACROSS NOTHERN SECTIONS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH BETTER FORCING PRESENT. COLD FRONT WILL 
LINGER AROUND NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI SUNDAY MORNING BEFORE PUSHING 
THROUGH THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. NOT EXPECTING 
MUCH OF A CHANGE IN TEMPERATURES WITH PASSAGE OF THE FRONT AS AREA 
BEGINS TO TRANSITION TO SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BY MONDAY/TUESDAY.

MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...LOWER MISSSISSIPI VALLEY WILL TRANSITION 
BRIEFLY TO SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THEN BACK TO ZONAL FLOW BY THE END 
OF THE PERIOD. LONG RANGE MODEL RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY THIS FORECAST 
PACKAGE IN GOOD AGREEMENT. 

A COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS THE SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL BE PARALLEL TO 
UPPER LEVEL FLOW. AT THIS TIME THINK BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION

MORNING/AFTERNOON AS ANY CONVECTION WHICH DEVELOPS WILL 
PRIMARILY BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN.

SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. ANY ONGOING CONVECTION UPSTREAM SHOULD WEAKEN AS 
DIURNAL INSTABILITY DIMINISHES AND WILL BE MOSTLY ELEVATED AND 
REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. RAISED POPS ACROSS NOTHERN SECTIONS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH BETTER FORCING PRESENT. COLD FRONT WILL 
LINGER AROUND NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI SUNDAY MORNING BEFORE PUSHING

1045 AM CST FRI NOV 4 2005

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS A COLD FRONT 
STRETCHING FROM NORTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN BACK THROUGH CENTRAL MISSOURI 
AND SOUTHEAST KANSAS. VISIBLE AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOW MOSTLY 
MID/HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE MOVING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING. 
THINK TEMPERATURES WILL HAVE A HARD TIME REACHING FORECAST HIGHS 
WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE AREA. WILL ISSUE AN UPDATE TO 
ADJUST FORECAST FOR CLOUD COVER TRENDS AND TO LOWER TEMPERATURES A 
FEW DEGREES. 

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY. 


.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 310 AM CST FRI NOV 4 2005...

HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE CAROLINA COAST THIS MORNING. LOW
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER WISCONSIN...WITH COLD FRONT TO NEAR WICHITA
KANSAS. SOUTH WINDS ARE ALLOWING MOISTURE TO RETURN TO THE AREA.
JUST SOUTH OF OUR AREA...DEWPOINTS RUNNING ABOUT 15 DEGREES HIGHER
THAN THEY WERE JUST 12 HOURS AGO. TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM LOWER
50S NEAR TUPELO...TO LOWER 60S ALONG AND WEST OF MISSISSIPPI
RIVER. CIRRUS MOVING INTO THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST...BUT NO SIGN
OF LOW CLOUDS ANY TIME SOON.

&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...
SOUTHWEST FLOW THROUGH THE SHORT TERM FORECAST. COLD FRONT MAKES
VERY LITTLE PROGRESS OVER THE NEXT 36 HOURS. THROUGH THE DAYTIME
HOURS ON SATURDAY...DONT EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN CIRRUS TO AFFECT
THE WEATHER. WHILE BOUNDARY AND 85O TEMPS WOULD INDICATE ABOUT 5
DEGREES OF WARMING TODAY...ADDITIONAL CLOUDS SHOULD HOLD THAT
INCREASE DOWN A LITTLE...WHICH SHOULD KEEP HIGHS BELOW RECORD
TERRITORY. WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW BRINGING IN MOISTURE...AFTERNOON
RELATIVE HUMIDITIES SHOULD STAY ABOVE RED FLAG LEVELS TODAY.

NOT MUCH CHANGE IN HIGHS ON SATURDAY. ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE
GREAT LAKES SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT WILL FINALLY BEGIN MOVING
COLD FRONT EAST. FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND
SUNDAY MORNING. SOUNDINGS INDICATE AIRMASS SHOULD BE CAPPED FOR
MOST OF THE DAY SATURDAY. BEST FORCING WILL BE NORTH OF OUR AREA.
CANNOT RULE OUT THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT AND WILL
KEEP CHANCE MENTION IN FORECAST AS IT STANDS. WILL MENTION IN HWO
THAT A FEW STORMS COULD BE STRONG...BUT WILL STOP SHORT OF SEVERE
MENTION FOR NOW...EVEN THOUGH SWODY2 HAS AREA NORTH OF INTERSTATE
40 OUTLOOKED FOR SLIGHT RISK.

DRIER...BUT NOT SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER AIR MOVES INTO THE AREA ON SUNDAY.

.LONG TERM (AFTER SUNDAY)...
SCENARIO FOR NEXT 48 HOURS WILL REPEAT TUESDAY THROUGH
THURSDAY...WITH ANOTHER CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. BEST TIMING OF
FRONTAL PASSAGE AND PRECIPITATION WOULD BE ABOUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
EVEN WITH PASSAGE OF THAT FRONT ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SURFACE HIGH
BEHIND IT IS OF PACIFIC ORIGIN. THIS BASICALLY MEANS THAT INDIAN

UPDATE...

WILL LET THE RED FLAG WARNING ISSUED EARLIER FOR FORESTRY
INTERESTS IN NORTHEAST AR...THE MO BOOTHEEL...AND WEST TN EXPIRE
AT 9 PM. HUMIDITIES ARE GRADUALLY INCREASING WITH SUNSET AND WINDS
ARE NOT AS STRONG. UPDATED ZONES TO REMOVE WIND GUSTS FOR THIS
EVENING. HOWEVER...A TIGHT SURFACE GRADIENT WILL KEEP SOUTH WINDS
BETWEEN 10 AND 15 MPH ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL
HELP TO HOLD TEMPERATURES UP. SATELLITE INDICATES SOME THIN CIRRUS
MOVING ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH...BUT MOSTLY CLEAR SHOULD SUFFICE FOR
OVERNIGHT.

PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 237 PM CST THU NOV 3 2005) 

FIRE WEATHER THE MAIN STORY ON THIS OTHERWISE QUIET DAY. RED FLAG
WARNING FOR ALL AREAS EXCEPT NORTH MS UNTIL 9 PM. CONDITIONS AT
20Z VERY CLOSE TO THE WARNING CRITERIA.

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
THE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN LOW PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS
AND HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SE WILL REMAIN STRONG OVERNIGHT. WINDS
WILL STAY UP AND PREVENT TEMPERATURES FROM FREE FALLING. DID
UNDERCUT GUIDANCE A LITTLE BIT AS IT HAS TRENDED TOO WARM FOR
SEVERAL DAYS NOW.

ANOTHER QUIET DAY IN STORE FOR TOMORROW WITH BROAD SW FLOW ALOFT
KEEPING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WELL TO OUR NORTH. NO FIRE WEATHER
HEADLINES ARE EXPECTED FOR FRIDAY. CONTINUED SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL
ALLOW DEWPOINTS TO SLOWLY RISE...KEEPING RH VALUES ABOVE THE
CRITICAL 25 PERCENT THRESHOLD. FEEL THAT MODELS ARE WAY TOO
AGGRESSIVE IN THE MOISTURE RETURN. IT WILL BE VERY HARD TO GET 60
DEWPOINTS IN HERE SINCE THE CLOSEST 60 DEWPOINTS ON THE SFC CHARTS
ARE DOWN IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. SUBSTANTIAL MIXING WILL OCCUR
TOMORROW TO KEEP DEWPOINTS SOMEWHAT IN CHECK AND WINDS ON THE
BREEZY SIDE. TEMPS LOOK TO BE SIMILAR TO TODAY.

CONDITIONS BEGIN TO CHANGE BY SATURDAY. A SHORTWAVE WILL PROGRESS
THROUGH THE RELATIVELY FAST 500 MB FLOW...PUSHING A COLD FRONT
INTO THE MIDSOUTH. GFS/NAM MUCH LESS AMPLIFIED WITH THE SHORTWAVE
THAN THE ECMWF/UKMET/CANADIAN. BEST CHANCES OF PRECIP LOOK TO BE
IN NORTHERN HALF OF CWA. MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD OF THE FRONT STILL
A QUESTION MARK. MODELS LIKELY OVERDOING THE 60 DEWPOINTS AND THAT
WILL HAVE AN AFFECT ON ANY POTENTIAL INSTABILITY. WILL KEEP
MENTION OF THUNDER GIVEN THE DEGREE OF FRONTAL FORCING AND THE
REGION BEING IN THE FAVORABLE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 100 KT JET.

LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
NOT MUCH OF AN AIRMASS CHANGE BEHIND THE FRONT WITH THE AIRMASS
BEING OF PACIFIC ORIGIN. WINDS QUICKLY TURN BACK OUT OF THE SOUTH
BY MONDAY. 12Z GFS HAS COME IN LINE WITH THE 00Z EURO ON BRINGING
A FRONT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY. THEREFORE...INTRODUCED
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. GIVEN THE FAST FLOW OF THE DOMINANT PACIFIC
JET...MODELS WILL CONTINUE TO STRUGGLE WITH HOW TO DEAL WITH THE
ENERGY (AS HAS BEEN SEEN FOR THIS WEEKENDS SYSTEM.) WILL LET THE
MODELS THINK ABOUT THINGS SOME MORE BEFORE GOING WITH HIGHER POPS
FOR THIS EVENT. 

ANOTHER RESULT OF THE PACIFIC JET IS THE CONTINUATION OF MILD
TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...DID NOT GO AS WARM
AS THE NEAR RECORD BREAKING 12Z MEX GUIDANCE. THERE ARE NO HINTS
OF ANY CANADIAN COLD AIR FOR AT THE LEAST THE NEXT 7 DAYS.

1225 PM CST THU NOV 3 2005

.UPDATE...

AFTER COORDINATION WITH THE TN DIVISION OF FORESTRY...HAVE ISSUED
A RED FLAG WARNING FOR WEST TENNESSEE. 18Z OBS SHOWING RH VALUES
BEGINNING TO DIP BELOW 30 PERCENT ALONG WITH WINDS SUSTAINED AT
15 MPH OR MORE. NOT ALL AREAS MAY REACH THE CRITERIA...BUT IT IS
CLOSE ENOUGH TO WARRANT THE ISSUANCE...ESPECIALLY WITH THE VERY
DRY GROUND CONDITIONS PRESENT. ALL PRODUCTS HAVE BEEN UPDATED AND
SENT. 

THINK WINDS WILL STAY DOWN JUST ENOUGH IN NORTH MISSISSIPPI TO
PRECLUDE A RED FLAG THERE. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND COORDINATE
OUR EFFORTS WITH THE MISSISSIPPI OFFICIALS.

ONCE AGAIN...THANKS TO ALL THE FORESTRY SERVICES FOR THEIR
COORDINATION.

&&

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 918 AM CST THU NOV 3 2005) 

UPDATE...

HAVE MADE UPDATES TO THE FORECAST PRIMARILY FOR FIRE WEATHER
PURPOSES. A LOOK AT THE 12Z NAM SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT AREAS
OVER NE ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL WILL MIX UP TO AROUND
900 MB WHERE WINDS OF 40KTS ARE INDICATED. THIS WILL RESULT IN
WINDS OF 15 TO 20 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS AT THE SURFACE. 
ADDITIONALLY...WITH THE ENTIRE ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN EXTREMELY DRY
(PRECIP WATERS LESS THAN 0.50) FEEL THAT DEWPOINTS WILL ALSO LOWER
SOME WITH AMPLE MIXING. TAKING ALL OF THIS INTO ACCOUNT ALONG WITH
COORDINATION WITH THE ARKANSAS AND MISSOURI FORESTRY
SERVICES...HAVE ISSUED A RED FLAG WARNING THROUGH THIS EVENING.

REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE. WILL SEND A ZONE
UPDATE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE HIGHER WINDS EXPECTED TODAY.

MANY THANKS GO OUT TO THE FORESTRY SERVICES IN AR AND MO FOR THEIR
COORDINATION THIS MORNING.

PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 215 AM CST WED NOV 2 2005) 

DISCUSSION...

HIGH PRESSURE HAS SHIFTED EAST THIS MORNING ALLOWING FOR SOUTHERLY 
WINDS TO KICK UP ALREADY ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH. 
EXPECT WINDS TO RANGE FROM 10 TO 20 MPH BY THIS AFTERNOON. THIS WILL 
CREATE A WILDFIRE CONCERN MAINLY ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE 
MIDSOUTH AS ONE OF THE DRIEST OCTOBERS ON RECORD HAS ALLOWED FOREST 
FUELS TO BECOME DRY. WARM TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON...COMBINED 
WITH LOW AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITY...AND THE STRONG AND GUSTY 
WINDS WILL HELP CREATE THE WILDFIRE DANGER. EXPECT HIGHS TO REACH 
INTO THE UPPER 70S THIS AFTERNOON.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN TO THE EAST OF THE MIDSOUTH THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THIS WILL KEEP THE GUSTY SOUTHERLY WINDS AND WARM 
TEMPERATURES AROUND THE CWA. EXPECT HIGHS TO REACH NEAR 80S DEGREES 
WITH LOWS THE UPPER 50S TO LOW 60S. SKIES WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR 
TO PARTLY CLOUDY DURING THIS TIME.

A SHORTWAVE WITH AN ASSOCIATED WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO 
PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH BEGINNING SATURDAY. THE WILL SPREAD SMALL 
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE CWA THROUGH SUNDAY. 
TEMPERATURES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO COOL DOWN MUCH BEHIND THE 
FRONT...SHOULD REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL.

HIGH PRESSURE REBUILDS INTO THE AREA FOR THE EARLY PART OF NEXT 
WEEK. EXPECT DRY CONDITIONS DURING THIS TIME. HIGH WILL QUICKLY 
SHIFT EASTWARD ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO REBOUND BACK TO NEAR 80 
DEGREES FOR HIGHS BY TUESDAY AS SOUTHERLY WINDS INCREASE OVER THE 
AREA.

ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE 
MIDSOUTH BY LATE WEDNESDAY. EXPECT PRECIP TO HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER 
THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

DYNAMICS WITH THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH HAVE SHIFTED TO THE NORTH AND
SOUTH OF THE MID-SOUTH. IN ADDITION...THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE

SOME TIME FOR THE RAIN TO REACH THE GROUND. WHILE AMOUNTS WILL BE
MOSTLY LIGHT...THINK HIGH POPS ARE STILL IN ORDER...AS A BAND OF
LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS MOVE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH OVERNIGHT.
EVAPORATED COOLING IS LOWERING TEMPERATURES INTO THE 50S AS THE
RAIN BEGINS. SATELLITE SHOWS CLOUDY SKIES OVER-SPREADING THE MID-
SOUTH.

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 608 PM CST MON OCT 31 2005) 

UPDATE...

WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST TO REMOVE THUNDERSTORMS FOR TONIGHT. LAPS
DATA INDICATES THE ATMOSPHERE IS STABLE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH WITH
LIFTED INDICES BETWEEN PLUS 8 AND 13. THE LATEST RUC INDICATES THE
UNSTABLE AIR WILL REMAIN TO OUR SOUTH OVERNIGHT. ALSO LATEST
SATELLITE AND LIGHTNING DATA INDICATES THUNDERSTORMS EARLIER TO THE WEST
HAVE SHRUNK WELL TO OUR SOUTH. WILL PROBABLY NEED TO TWEAK THE
FORECAST SOME MORE IN A LATER UPDATE.

PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 302 PM CST MON OCT 31 2005) 

REGIONAL RADARS INDICATE A LONG LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS FROM LITTLE
ROCK TO FAR EAST TEXAS. NUMEROUS SHOWERS WERE IN THE WAKE OF THE
LEADING LINE OF STORMS. THE LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS
BEEN SLOW TO MOVE EASTWARD TODAY SINCE THE LOWER AND MID LEVEL
FLOW HAS BEEN ORIENTED PARALLEL TO THE LINE OF STORMS.

EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR 
BRINGING RAIN TO MOST AREAS OF THE MIDSOUTH. CURRENT THINKING WILL 
BRING THE RAIN FIRST INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS BY 7 PM. BELIEVE THAT 
THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA WILL SEE RAIN BEGIN AROUND 11 PM. BY LATE 
TONIGHT THE SHOWERS SHOULD MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE TUPELO/COLUMBUS 
MS AREA. SOME LINGERING SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE TUESDAY MORNING 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTHEAST FORECAST AREA.

THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE MIDSOUTH CAUSING DRIER 
AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS 
TEMPERATURES BEGIN TO WARM INTO THE LOWER 70S AGAIN BY WEDNESDAY. 
THE WARM TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO A SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS...CAUSING THE LOW LEVEL FLOW TO RETURN TO 
THE SOUTH.

TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEK WILL BE ON THE RISE WITH MAX 
TEMPERATURES FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN THE UPPER 70S LONG RANGE MODELS 
SUGGEST A SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL SWING ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL U.S. SATURDAY AND PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY NIGHT. A COOL DOWN WILL BE IN STORE AFTER

.DISCUSSION...
REGIONAL RADARS INDICATE A LONG LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS FROM LITTLE 
ROCK TO FAR EAST TEXAS. NUMEROUS SHOWERS WERE IN THE WAKE OF THE 
LEADING LINE OF STORMS. THE LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS 
BEEN SLOW TO MOVE EASTWARD TODAY SINCE THE LOWER AND MID LEVEL FLOW 
HAS BEEN ORIENTED PARALLEL TO THE LINE OF STORMS.

EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR 
BRINGING RAIN TO MOST AREAS OF THE MIDSOUTH. CURRENT THINKING WILL 
BRING THE RAIN FIRST INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS BY 7 PM. BELIEVE THAT 
THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA WILL SEE RAIN BEGIN AROUND 11 PM. BY LATE 
TONIGHT THE SHOWERS SHOULD MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE TUPELO/COLUMBUS 
MS AREA. SOME LINGERING SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE TUESDAY MORNING 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTHEAST FORECAST AREA.

THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE MIDSOUTH CAUSING DRIER 
AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS 
TEMPERATURES BEGIN TO WARM INTO THE LOWER 70S AGAIN BY WEDNESDAY. 
THE WARM TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO A SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS...CAUSING THE LOW LEVEL FLOW TO RETURN TO 
THE SOUTH.

TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEK WILL BE ON THE RISE WITH MAX 
TEMPERATURES FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN THE UPPER 70S LONG RANGE MODELS 
SUGGEST A SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL SWING ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL U.S. SATURDAY AND PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY NIGHT. A COOL DOWN WILL BE IN STORE AFTER 
SATURDAY WITH DAYTIME TEMPERATURES RETURNING TO THE UPPER 60S.

NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FORMED OVER EASTERN 
OKLAHOMA...NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS AND SOUTHWESTERN MISSOURI THIS 
MORNING. THIS IS IN ASSOCIATION WITH A STRONG SHORTWAVE DROPPING 
INTO THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE. THE DEEPENING TROUGH WILL SLOW THE 
EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE STORMS TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
SINCE THE FLOW IS MORE PARALLEL TO THE CONVECTION. HAVE TRENDED 
RAINFALL TO BEGIN MAINLY THIS AFTERNOON OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON JUST EAST OF THE MS RIVER. STILL LOOKS LIKE BEST 
CHANCES WILL BE OVERNIGHT FOR MOST AREAS.

SHARPENING UPPER TROUGH AND ITS SURFACE FRONT IS NOW OVER THE

TODAY AND INCREASE SHOWER COVERAGE IN NORTHWESTERN COUNTIES OF

ISOLATED SHOWERS CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS EXTREME NORTHEAST ARKANSAS

COLD FRONT WHICH EXTENDS FROM NORTHEAST IOWA THROUGH CENTRAL KANSAS
INTO THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE. SKIES REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE

A SLOW INCREASE IN CLOUDS OVERNIGHT. WITH FEWER CLOUDS OUT NOW
TEMPERATURES HAVE FALLEN A LITTLE MORE THAN EXPECTED SO HAVE ADJUSTED

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WAS MOVING ACROSS NORTH-CENTRAL ARKANSAS THIS 
AFTERNOON AND HAS PRODUCED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS AND SOUTHERN MISSOURI. MAINLY HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS HAS 
MOVED INTO THE FORECAST AREA IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS SHORTWAVE. 

LATEST MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE WITH UPCOMING RAIN EVENT FOR MONDAY 
INTO TUESDAY. THE NAM/UKMET ARE SIMILAR IN DRIVING THE APPROACHING 
SHORTWAVE WHICH IS CURRENTLY OVER COLORADO...SOUTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. NOT ONLY SOUTH OF THE AREA BUT MUCH SLOWER MOVING THAN THE 
GFS. SHOULD THE NAM/UKMET VERIFY...THEN RAIN WILL LIKELY MOVE SOUTH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT...LEAVING TUESDAY DRY. 
HOWEVER...THE TRACK OF THE GFS SHORTWAVE WILL KEEP MOST OF TUESDAY 
WET...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI.

WITH SUCH VARIABILITY IN THE SOLUTIONS...HAVE A TOUGH TIME ARGUING 
WITH GUIDANCE NUMBERS THIS FORECAST CYCLE. CAN SAY WITH SOME 
CERTAINTY THAT IT WILL RAIN OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS MONDAY 
NIGHT...AND POSSIBLY OVER MOST LOCATIONS. HOWEVER...CURRENT FORECAST 
WILL KEEP THE RAIN THROUGH TUESDAY...WHICH IS AN OPTIMISTIC 
FORECAST. 

WE WILL HAVE TO KEEP EYES ON A HOPEFUL MODEL CONVERGENCE OVER THE 
NEXT SEVERAL HOURS.

THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST WILL BE DRY AND FAIRLY MILD AS NEARLY 
ZONAL FLOW OVERTAKES THE CENTRAL U.S. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE 
SEASONAL NORMALS WEDNESDAY THROUGH AT LEAST...NEXT SUNDAY.

EXCELLENT FALL WEATHER WILL CONTINUE OVER THE MIDSOUTH TODAY AS
LOTS OF SUNSHINE WARMS IT RAPIDLY BACK UP AND WINDS GET BACK TO
THE SOUTH. THIS WEATHER IS DUE TO NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND A
SURFACE HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN ATLANTIC COAST.

AN UPPER TROUGH WILL DEVELOP OVER THE PLAINS BY MONDAY MORNING
AND CREATE A LOW OVER THE STATE OF OKLAHOMA. THIS LOW AND ITS
FRONT WILL CARRY MOISTURE AND LIFT WITH IT. SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS COULD DEVELOP WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY NOON
MONDAY AND TWO COUNTIES FARTHER EAST BY EVENING MONDAY. SHOWERS
WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT MONDAY.

THE LOW WILL MOVE INTO MISSISSIPPI BY TUESDAY MORNING AND
CONTINUE THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE DAY
TUESDAY.

AFTER THAT...THE SURFACE LOW GOES DOWN TOWARD BILOXI MS AND RAIN
WILL DIMINISH IN OUR AREA FROM THE NORTH TUESDAY EVENING.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...IT SHOULD BE DRY. TEMPERATURES WILL
RANGE FROM THE 70S FOR HIGHS TO THE 40S AND 50S FOR LOWS.

SKIES REMAIN CLEAR OVER THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON WHICH HAS ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO WARM UP INTO THE 60S. SURFACE HIGH IS MOVING OFF TO
EAST AND THAT SHOULD ALLOW LIGHT SOUTH WINDS TO BLOW OVERNIGHT WHICH
SHOULD HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES UP A LITTLE COMPARED TO THE LAST COUPLE

PATCHY FROST TONIGHT SO WILL MENTION IN ZONES. COLD FRONT CURRENTLY
ACROSS NORTHWEST KANSAS AND CENTRAL NEBRASKA WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. FRONT WILL BE TOO FAR AWAY ON SUNDAY
SO SUNNY SKIES SHOULD BE FOUND ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SOUTH WINDS
SHOULD HELP BRING WARMER AIR INTO THE REGION SO MOST LOCATIONS SHOULD
SEE TEMPERATURES ABOVE 70. CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE
FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY NIGHT AND WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE MONDAY.
WITH FRONT APPROACHING MONDAY EXPECT SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS TO MOVE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
438 AM CDT THU OCT 27 2005

.UPDATE...

SATELLITE SHOWS AREA OF STRATUS OVER WEST TN AND EAST AR HAVE
INCREASED DRAMATICALLY. AS A RESULT OF THE CLOUD
COVER...TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE LOW 40S IN MANY AREAS.
WHAT FROST HAD DEVELOPED IS NOW LIKELY MELTING OR HAS MELTED.
THEREFORE HAVE UPDATED TO CANCEL FROST ADVISORY FOR WEST
TN...NORTHEAST AR...BOOTHEEL AND EXTREME NORTHERN MS.

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 301 AM CDT THU OCT 27 2005) 

DISCUSSION...

SATELLITE SHOWS A DECK OF BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUDS AT AROUND
6000FT ADVANCING INTO WEST TN AND EAST AR AHEAD OF A SHORTWAVE
TROUGH FROM THE NORTH. BEHIND THE LEADING EDGE OF THE TROUGH MORE
CLOUDS ARE GATHERING OVER EAST CENTRAL MISSOURI. NAM AND GFS BOTH
SHOW DEW POINT DEPRESSIONS <2C AT 850-825MB ASSOCIATED WITH THESE
CLOUDS. 06Z NAM MODEL SOUNDINGS SEEM TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON
CLOUD COVER TODAY. THIS SHOWS THE CLOUD DECK HOLDING STRONG AT
JACKSON AND MEMPHIS. THE SOUNDING SHOWS CLOUDS AT 12Z AT
JONESBORO...BREAKING UP FOR A TIME THIS MORNING BEFORE CLOUDING
BACK OVER LATE IN THE MORNING AS THE MOISTURE ACROSS EAST CENTRAL
MISSOURI COMBINED WITH DIURNAL HEATING AID CLOUD DEVELOPMENT. THE
MODELS SHOW THE PRIME MOISTURE AXIS ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION WITH
THE SOUTHERN EDGE AROUND THE TUPELO TO CLARKSDALE AREA. BEST GUESS
IS FOR A MOSTLY CLOUDY FORECAST FOR ALL AREAS NORTH OF TUPELO AND
CLARKSDALE...PARTLY CLOUDY SOUTH OF THOSE AREAS. MOST AREAS HAVE
SEEN TEMPS DROP DOWN INTO THE MID 30S BEFORE THE CLOUDS ROLLED IN.
SO FROST LIKELY HAS FORMED IN THESE AREAS. TEMPS HAVE WARMED BACK
UP A COUPLE DEGREES UNDER THE CLOUD COVER SO NOT SURE IF FROST
STILL EXISTS THERE OR NOT. WILL CONTINUE THE FROST ADVISORY FOR
NOW. COOLED TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE OVER WEST TN INTO
NORTHEAST AR DUE TO CLOUD COVER FOR TODAY. 

MODELS SHOWING CLOUD COVER QUICKLY DISSIPATING THIS EVENING WITH
THE LOSS OF THE DIURNAL INSTABILITY AND THE SHORTWAVE MOVING SOUTH
OF THE AREA. SOUNDINGS SUPPORT SKIES CLEARING. WILL MENTION PATCHY
FROST AFTER MIDNIGHT SINCE DEW POINTS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN
THE LOW TO MID 30S DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. 850MB TEMPS WILL
CONTINUE TO WARM AND 1000MB GEOSTROPHIC WINDS OF AROUND 10-15KTS
INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE JUST ENOUGH WIND TO KEEP THE SURFACE
LAYER STIRRED. 

UPPER RIDGE CURRENTLY OVER THE PLAINS BUILDS OVER THE AREA ON
FRIDAY AND INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR MAINLY CLEAR
SKIES AND A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WITH HIGHS POSSIBLY REACHING 70
ON SATURDAY. THE THREAT FOR FROST WILL PERSIST UNTIL SATURDAY
MORNING DUE TO LOW DEW POINTS AND LIGHT WINDS AT NIGHT. THIS WILL
BE ESPECIALLY TRUE FOR THE COLD SPOTS ACROSS WEST TN AND NORTHEAST
MS. 

THE NEXT THREAT FOR RAIN COMES EARLY NEXT WEEK AS GFS CONTINUE TO
SHOW THE UPPER RIDGE SLIDING OFF TO THE EAST AND ALLOWING A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO MOVE INTO THE REGION ON MONDAY AND THROUGH THE
REGION MONDAY NIGHT OR EARLY TUESDAY. INSTABILITY DOES NOT LOOK
STRONG ENOUGH TO MENTION THUNDER AT THIS TIME.

.UPDATE...

CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS PREVAIL ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS
EVENING. SFC TEMPS FALLING RAPIDLY ONCE AGAIN. 02Z TEMPS AND
DEWPOINTS RUNNING A LITTLE WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT AND LOW TEMP
FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. FROST ADVISORY CONTINUES FROM MIDNIGHT
THROUGH 9 AM THU. WATCHING AN AREA OF MID CLOUDS MOVING SOUTH
ACROSS MISSOURI ASSOCD WITH A PRETTY DECENT 500 MB SHORTWAVE.
EXTRAPOLATION BRINGS SOME OF THESE CLOUDS INTO NORTHERNMOST AREAS
LATE TONIGHT. FORECAST ON TRACK WITH NO CHANGES ATTM.

&&

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 204 PM CDT WED OCT 26 2005) 

DISCUSSION...
SURFACE HIGH PRETTY MUCH CENTERED ON MISSISSIPPI RIVER THIS
AFTERNOON. CUMULUS FIELD MUCH LESS EXTENSIVE THAN LAST FEW DAYS.
TEMPS AT 18Z MIDDLE 50S TO LOWER 60S...AND EXPECT A COUPLE DEGREES
TO GO YET FOR HIGHS.

SHORT TERM (THROUGH SATURDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH TO REMAIN OVER EASTERN U.S. THROUGH SATURDAY. SHORTWAVE
MOVING SOUTH FROM GREAT LAKES TONIGHT...BUT MOST MID-LEVEL
CLOUDINESS SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE CWA. AFTER THAT...NOT A
GREAT DEAL OF TROUBLE WITH CLOUDS AND WEATHER THROUGH SATURDAY.

TEMPERATURE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT A BIT OF A PROBLEM. ALL MOS
GUIDANCE DEWPOINTS RUNNING ABOUT 5 DEGREES WARMER THAN REALITY.
CURRENT DEWPOINTS IN A SIMILAR RANGE TO THOSE YESTERDAY...AND SEE
NO LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION OCCURRING. AS LONG AS CLOUD
FORECAST COOPERATES...EXPECT MINS WITHIN A DEGREE OR TWO OF THIS
MORNING. THIS IS AT LEAST 2 CATEGORIES COOLER THAN GUIDANCE IN
MOST AREAS.

OF COURSE...THAT MEANS MORE FROST TOMORROW MORNING. WHILE ISOLATED
AREAS WILL FALL BELOW FREEZING AGAIN FOR SEVERAL HOURS...CONFIDENCE
IN WIDESPREAD SUB-FREEZING TEMPERATURES NOT HIGH ENOUGH FOR A
FREEZE WARNING...SO WILL GO FROST ADVISORY ENTIRE CWA. END OF
GROWING SEASON LOCALLY DEFINED AS MINS OF 28 OR COLDER...AND THERE
WERE ONLY ISOLATED REPORTS THAT LOW THIS MORNING...SO NEED
SOMETHING OUT THERE.

TEMPERATURES THURSDAY AND FRIDAY A LITTLE WARMER THAN TODAY BY A
DEGREE OR TWO. SLIGHT MODERATION IN MINS FOR FRIDAY MORNING AS
WELL. AS RETURN FLOW GETS GOING...TEMPS SATURDAY WARM TO A LITTLE
ABOVE NORMAL.

LONG TERM (SUNDAY AND BEYOND)...
RIDGE BEGINS TO MOVE EAST ON SUNDAY...AND CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS
REASONABLE. BEYOND THAT...LITTLE TRUST GIVEN IN 12Z RUN OF GFS
SOLUTION. THAT MODEL TRIES TO CLOSE OFF AN UPPER LOW OVER SOUTHERN
MS/AL ON TUESDAY. THIS SOLUTION WOULD BRING A VERY WET PERIOD
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. ECMWF/CANADIAN/NOGAPS MUCH MORE
PROGRESSIVE WITH SYSTEM...WHICH WOULD MEAN DRIER WEATHER. GFS
SOLUTION DISCOUNTED FOR THIS RUN BEYOND SUNDAY...AT LEAST UNTIL
SOME MORE RUN TO RUN CONTINUITY OCCURS. WILL KEEP LOW POPS IN
FORECAST FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...DRY WEDNESDAY...WHICH IS IN STEP
WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. TEMPS IN EXTENDED SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY
ABOVE NORMAL.

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 305 AM CDT WED OCT 26 2005) 

DISCUSSION...

COLDEST MORNING OF THE SEASON SO FAR WITH HIGH PRESSURE PROVIDING
CALM WINDS ACROSS THE REGION. CLEAR SKIES ALLOWING FOR EXCELLENT
RADIATIONAL COOLING. DEW POINTS ARE IN THE LOWER 30S ALLOWING
TEMPS TO REACH THE FREEZING POINT IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS OUTSIDE OF
THE SHELBY COUNTY 240 LOOP. FREEZE WARNING WILL BE ALLOWED TO
CONTINUE TILL 9 AM THIS MORNING.

NAM CONTINUES TO SHOW 850 DEW POINT DEPRESSIONS LESS THAN 2C WITH
RH GREATER THAN 85 PERCENT OVER WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS THIS
AFTERNOON. NAM SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS TO BE A VERY THIN MOIST LAYER
AND GFS/NAM CU RULE POINT TO SCATTERED TO BROKEN CONDITIONS THERE
THIS AFTERNOON. WILL GO WITH PARTLY CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON ALTHOUGH
THERE MAY BE NEED FOR AN EARLY AFTERNOON UPDATE IF THE COVERAGE
BECOMES MORE EXTENSIVE THAN CURRENT THINKING. THE UPPER TROUGH
OVER THE EASTERN U.S. IS BEGINNING TO GIVE WAY TO AN UPPER RIDGE
OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AS A RESULT TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY WARM
UP OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT. SO WINDS
ARE EXPECTED TO GO LIGHT OR CALM. THE UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL
BE OVER THE AREA SO AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT CLOUDS. ADDITIONAL
SOME WARMING WILL BE OCCURRING AT 850MB. NO SIGNIFICANT DEW POINT
RISE IS ANTICIPATED TODAY AND RADIATIONAL CONDITIONS SHOULD BE
SUFFICIENT FOR AT LEAST PATCHY AREAS OF FROST. WOULD NOT BE
SHOCKED IF A SECOND FROST OR EVEN FREEZE ADVISORY OR WARNING WOULD
BE NEEDED FOR TONIGHT. BUT DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF THE UPPER
SHORTWAVE FEEL THAT IT IS BEST FOR DAY SHIFT TO REEVALUATE. 

UPPER RIDGE WILL PROVIDE DRY WEATHER AND MAINLY SUNNY CONDITIONS
INTO THE WEEKEND. GFS/EUROPEAN CONTINUE TO SHOW THE UPPER RIDGE
MOVING EAST OF THE REGION AND GIVING WAY TO AN UPPER SHORTWAVE
TROUGH WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN. THERE IS QUITE
A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING WITH GFS DELAYING THE ARRIVAL NOW

1100 AM CDT TUE OCT 25 2005

.UPDATE...
COLD AIR STRATOCU HAS BEEN SLOW TO DEVELOP THIS MORNING. BY THIS
TIME YESTERDAY...MOST OF THE AREA WAS MOSTLY CLOUDY. MOISTURE
LEVELS HAVE BEEN A LITTLE LOWER THAN YESTERDAY...AND COLD AIR
ADVECTION NOT AS STRONG. WILL UPDATE AFTER 16Z OBS ARRIVE TO BE A
LITTLE MORE OPTIMISTIC ON CLOUD COVER. MOST AREAS ARE RUNNING A
COUPLE OF DEGREES COOLER THAN MONDAY. ADDITIONAL SUNSHINE TODAY
SHOULD BALANCE OUT HIGH TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO WHAT WE ACHIEVED
YESTERDAY...OR A TOUCH WARMER.

&&

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 242 AM CDT TUE OCT 25 2005) 

DISCUSSION...

SURFACE MAP SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE ORIENTED NORTH-SOUTH
THROUGH THE PLAINS. THERE HAS BEEN ENOUGH OF A GRADIENT OVERNIGHT
FOR THE WINDS TO KEEP UP. THIS COMBINED WITH CLOUD COVER DURING
THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT WAS SUFFICIENT TO KEEP TEMPS FROM
FALLING TO THE DEW POINTS WHICH ARE IN THE LOW TO MID 30S. MODELS
CONTINUE TO SHOW A GREAT DEAL OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AROUND.
SATELLITE TREND LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY WHERE CLOUDS
DIMINISHED DURING THE NOCTURNAL HOURS. BASED UPON THE TREND EXPECT
STRATOCU TO REDEVELOP AFTER MID MORNING WITH MODELS SHOWING THAT
THE CLOUD COVER MAY BE MOST PREVALENT EAST OF A LINE FROM
JONESBORO TO CLARKSDALE MS. 850 TEMPS ARE A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER
AND HAVE FORECASTED HIGHS TO BE A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER AS A
RESULT. TEMPS SHOULD BE COOLER ACROSS WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS DUE
TO ANTICIPATED CLOUD COVER. THE STRATOCU FIELD SHOULD DIMINISH
DURING THE EVENING AS HAS BEEN THE TREND. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD
OVER THE AREA RESULTING IN LIGHT WINDS. COMBINED WITH LOW DEW
POINTS EXPECT MOST AREAS TO SEE TEMPS IN THE MID TO UPPER 30S AT
LEAST. WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF A FEW OF THE COLDER SPOTS ACROSS
WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS SAW TEMPS AS LOW AS 30. MANY LOCATIONS
WILL LIKELY SEE FROST IN THIS SCENARIO THUS PROMPTING A FROST
ADVISORY FOR THE REGION. A FEW LOCATIONS MAY NEED TO BE UPGRADED
TO A FREEZE WARNING BASED UPON TRENDS DURING THE DAY. MIN TEMP
INSIDE THE 240 LOOP IN SHELBY COUNTY MAY BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER
DUE TO HEAT ISLAND EFFECTS AND FROST MAY NOT EVEN OCCUR THERE.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS
AS THE UPPER PATTERN GRADUALLY SHIFTS EASTWARD FROM THE CURRENT
STATE OF A TROUGH IN THE EAST WITH A RIDGE OVER THE WEST. THE
UPPER RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE REGION WILL RESULT IN A GRADUAL
WARMING TREND ALONG WITH CONTINUED DRY WEATHER. ANOTHER
FROST/FREEZE IS POSSIBLE AGAIN TOMORROW NIGHT AS WINDS WILL LIKELY
REMAIN LIGHT BUT NOT CERTAIN JUST HOW MUCH WARMING WILL OCCUR
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN. 

THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN IS NOT UNTIL LATE IN THE WEEKEND OR EARLY
NEXT WEEK AS THE UPPER RIDGE MOVES EASTWARD AND A SHORTWAVE

DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER LOW WAS CENTERED OVER THE OH VLY THIS AFTERNOON AND

AND A MODERATE NORTH WIND PROVIDED FOR A RATHER COOL LATE OCTOBER 
DAY. EXPECT THE UPPER LOW TO GRADUALLY MOVE EASTWARD TONIGHT WHILE 
THE LOW CLOUDS TO BREAKUP. PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH 
TO SUPPORT WINDS JUST HIGH ENOUGH TO INHIBIT A LOT OF FROST.

A LONGWAVE UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE ERN HALF OF THE U.S. 
THROUGH THE ENTIRE WEEK...SO EXPECT COOL WEATHER TO CONTINUE THROUGH 
THE PERIOD. A POLAR HIGH WELL TO THE NW WILL GRADUALLY BUILD INTO 
OUR REGION TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. WINDS WILL DECREASE AND BECOME 
NEARLY CALM BY TUESDAY NIGHT...SO FROST WILL AT LEAST BE PATCHY IN 
ALL PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA WHILE PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE 
EXPERIENCE SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD FROST. A FROST ADVISORY MAY BE 
NEEDED TUESDAY NIGHT FOR A PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE LOWS 
DROP INTO THE MID 30S...BUT WILL WAIT UNTIL WE GET CLOSER TO THAT 
TIME PERIOD. PATCHY FROST WILL AGAIN BE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...MAINLY IN PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI 
AS THE HIGH SLOWLY RETREATS TO THE EAST.

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION 
FRIDAY...SO THE COOL AIR WILL BE REINFORCED AGAIN WITH SOME MORE

AN UPPER TROUGH EXTENDING ACROSS THE OH VLY INTO THE LWR MS VLY WILL 
GRADUALLY MOVE EASTWARD TODAY. A DECK OF STRATOCU MOVING IN FROM THE 
NORTH SHOULD CONTAIN ENOUGH BREAKS TO WARRANT PARTLY CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS. THE AIRMASS IS VERY COOL SO TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW

.DISCUSSION...
OVERNIGHT...CLOUDS HAVE BEEN VERY SLOW TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA. THIS HAS ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO DIP INTO THE LOWER 30S FOR A 
FEW LOCATIONS OVER WEST TENNESSEE. 

LATEST ISENTROPIC SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES INCREASING CONDENSATION 
PRESSURE DEFICITS FROM SOUTHERN MISSOURI INTO MISSISSIPPI AND 
DOWNSLOPE WINDS/DEEP COLD ADVECTION. THIS HELPS EXPLAIN WHY THE LOW 
CLOUD DECK VIRTUALLY HAS CEASED FURTHER DEVELOPMENT SOUTHWARD. SOME 
PATCHY FOG IS LIKELY ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTHWEST 
TENNESSEE AS TEMPERATURES WILL FALL CLOSE TO DEWPOINT VALUES.

MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES TODAY WITH BREEZY NORTHWESTERLY 
WINDS. COLD AIR ADVECTION AT 850MB SUGGESTS THAT MAX TEMPERATURES 
WILL GENERALLY RANGE FROM THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S.

THE DEEP UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE 
MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES TO THE MIDSOUTH FOR MOST OF THE WEEK. 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE OUT OF CANADA WILL GET PULLED INTO THE STRONG 
NORTHERLY FLOW TODAY. THIS WILL PROVIDE ANOTHER COOL SHOT OF AIR TO 
INFILTRATE THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY. DAYTIME TEMPERATURES TOMORROW WILL 
ONLY BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER THAN TODAY/S VALUES. HOWEVER...BY 
TUESDAY MORNING...LACK OF CLOUD COVER AND ADDITIONAL COLD AIR MOVING 
INTO THE REGION MAY ALLOW FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
TO EXPERIENCE SOME FREEZING TEMPERATURES. MODEL GUIDANCE IS 
SUGGESTING THAT LOW TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY MORNING WILL BE WELL 
ABOVE FREEZING...BUT WE ARE TRENDING TOWARD THE COOLER VALUES.

ANOTHER SYSTEM TO WATCH THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WILL BE THE NEXT 
SHORTWAVE PROGGED TO STRENGTHEN AND DROP OUT OF THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION. THIS WOULD AFFECT OUR FORECAST AREA FRIDAY WITH COOLER 
TEMPERATURES AND POSSIBLY A SHOT OF LIGHT RAIN. AFTER THIS SYSTEM 
DRIFTS EAST...SHORTWAVE RIDGING WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RETURN TO 
NEAR NORMAL VALUES BY LATE NEXT WEEKEND.

SOME BREAK IN THE CLOUDS OVER SOUTHERN MISSOURI BUT ANOTHER BAND OF
CLOUDS IS MOVING SOUTH ACROSS NORTHERN MISSOURI. EXPECT A BRIEF
PERIOD WHERE CLOUDS WILL THIN OUT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT
BEFORE CLOUDS RETURN SO MOSTLY CLOUDY FORECAST SHOULD SUFFICE FOR
TONIGHT. UPPER LOW SHOULD BEGIN TO MOVE EAST LATER TONIGHT AND
MONDAY BUT WILL STILL SEE MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES ON MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT. THAT WILL MAKE IT HARD FOR TEMPERATURES TO MAKE IT OUT OF THE
50S ON MONDAY BUT ALSO WILL KEEP THEM FROM FALLING TOO FAR MONDAY
NIGHT. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE EASTERN U.S. FOR MUCH
OF THE WEEK WHICH SHOULD KEEP COOL AND DRY WEATHER OVER THE FORECAST

A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM PADUCAH TO FORT SMITH AND IT WAS 
MOVING VERY SLOWLY SOUTHWARD. SOME LIGHT RAIN WAS OCCURRING ALONG 
AND JUST NORTH OF THE FRONT MAINLY OVER SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. THE RAIN 
IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 110+ KNOT JET STREAK BISECTING THIS AREA.

THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT WILL PERSIST UNTIL THE SHORTWAVE 
DIVING OUT THE NORTHERN PLAINS GETS CLOSER TO THE REGION. EXPECT THE 
FRONT TO BEGIN SURGING SOUTHWARD BY 8 AM THIS MORNING. IT SHOULD 
MOVE THROUGH THE WHOLE FORECAST AREA BY 3 PM...EXITING NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI LAST. AS MENTIONED BEFORE...SOME LIGHT RAIN MAY OCCUR 
MAINLY OVER NORTHWEST TENNESSEE AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL. ANY 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT I.E. LESS THAN ONE TENTH INCH...AND  
RAIN CHANCES HAVE BEEN TRIMMED BACK FROM EARLIER FORECASTS. 

THE MAIN STORY WILL BE THE AFTERMATH OF THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. THIS 
WILL LEAVE THE MIDSOUTH IN A PATTERN WHICH WILL MAKE TEMPERATURES 
WELL BELOW SEASONAL NORMS FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. THESE DAYS WILL BE  
THE COLDEST TEMPERATURES ALL WEEK. 

THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. WILL WEAKEN ITS GRIP ON THE 
MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY. THIS MEANS THAT TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY WARM 
CLOSER TO THE SEASONAL NORMALS BY NEXT WEEKEND. RAIN CHANCES WILL 
ALSO REMAIN LOW THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK.

LOW CLOUDS HAVE DIMINISHED FROM PARTS OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE 
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL. THE CLEARING LINE IS SLOWLY MOVING SOUTHWARD AND 
EXPECT BY MID MORNING THAT MOST OF THE CLOUDS WILL HAVE MOVED OUT OF 
THE AREA. THE ONLY EXCEPTION WILL LIKELY BE NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI.

WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION TODAY WILL KEEP DAYTIME TEMPERATURES IN THE 
UPPER 60S ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. 

A STRONG UPPER LOW WILL DROP OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS TODAY. THIS 
UPPER LOW WILL BEGIN TO INFLUENCE THE WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA LATE TONIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY. THERE WILL BE A LOT OF UPPER 
LEVEL ENERGY THAT COULD GENERATE A FEW SPRINKLES SUNDAY. HOWEVER THE 
MOST SIGNIFICANT PART OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BE THE COLD AIR ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT. DAYTIME HIGHS ON SUNDAY WILL BE IN THE LOWER 60S AND THAT 
MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC. A VERY COLD NIGHT IN STORE SUNDAY WITH MONDAY 
MORNING LOWS IN THE UPPER 30S AND LOWER 40S. 

THIS UPPER LOW REINFORCES THE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. THIS WILL 
CAUSE BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE 
UPCOMING WEEK.

PRECIP CHANCES WILL REMAIN SLIM FOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS. HOWEVER...THERE 
MAY BE SOME LIGHT RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONG SYSTEM THAT WILL

A WEAKENING SHORTWAVE WAS TRANSLATING ACROSS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS THIS 
MORNING. AT THE SURFACE...A COLD FRONT IS LOCATED FROM PADUCAH TO 
MEMPHIS TO GREENWOOD. SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS WERE MOVING ACROSS PARTS 
OF WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI THIS MORNING. THESE 
SHOWERS WILL EXIT THE AREA BY 8 AM.

THE MODELS ARE DIFFERING SLIGHTLY AS FAR AS THE STRENGTH OF THE 
DEEPENING TROUGH THIS WEEKEND. THE NAM IS MUCH STRONGER THAN THE GFS 
AND MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE COLD AIR ADVECTION LATER IN THE WEEKEND.
THERE IS NO DOUBT THAT THIS TROUGH WILL BE SIGNIFICANT AND USHER IN 
MUCH COOLER AIR SUNDAY INTO MONDAY.

CURRENTLY THE UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE LOCATED OVER SOUTHERN 
SASKATCHEWAN WILL DIG INTO NORTHERN MINNESOTA LATER TONIGHT. A 
STRONG JET STREAK ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE UPPER LOW WILL DEEPEN THE 
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE U.S. THROUGH SUNDAY. DAYTIME 
TEMPERATURES SUNDAY WILL BE AROUND 60 DEGREES WITH GUSTY NORTHERLY 
WINDS. PERHAPS SOME LIGHT PRECIP WILL ACCOMPANY THE STRONG SHORTWAVE 
LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...BUT AM NOT CONVINCED THAT IT 
WILL BE MEASURABLE. THUS HAVE REMOVED SLIGHT CHANCES FOR THIS TIME 
FRAME.

THERE ARE SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE LATEST LONG RANGE FORECASTS. 
HAVE OPTED TO ALLOW ANOTHER RUN OF THE MODELS BEFORE JUMPING TO 
CONCLUSIONS TOO EARLY FOR LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. HAVE NOT MADE 
ANY MODIFICATIONS TO DAY 5 AND ON.

COMPLETELY REMOVE POPS FROM TONIGHTS FORECAST SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT
CHANCE IN FOR NOW. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH FRIDAY

SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR BOTH FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. COOLER AIR
WILL BEGIN TO MOVE IN BEHIND THE FRONT WITH TEMPERATURES SOME 10-15
DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY. MAJOR CHANCE TO UPPER LEVEL PATTERN
BEGINS SATURDAY AS CLOSED LOW WILL DROP SOUTH FROM THE NORTHERN

PRESSURE NEAR WICHITA WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT STRETCHING BACK 
THROUGH WESTERN OKLAHOMA. MEANWHILE...A STATIONARY BOUNDARY EXTENDS 
FROM SOUTHERN ILLINOIS BACK TOWARDS SPRINGFIELD MISSOURI. ACROSS THE 
MID SOUTH IN THE WARM SECTOR TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING ARE IN THE 
MID 60S TO LOWER 70S. MAIN CONCERNS THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS SEVERE 
WEATHER POTENTIAL TODAY AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES THIS WEEKEND WITH 
APPROACH OF SECONDARY COLD FRONT. 

TODAY AND TONIGHT...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARD THE 
MID SOUTH TODAY. 700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL 
INCREASE TO 6.5 C/KM IN RESPONSE TO APPROACHING COLD FRONT.  MODEL 
SOUNDINGS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA PRODUCE 
SURFACE BASED CAPES OF 1200 J/KG...LI/S AROUND -4...AND NEARLY 
UNIDIRECTIONAL WINDS AT 850 MB/20KT/ AND AND 50KT WINDS AT 500 MB. 
ALSO 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS AROUND 14C SUGGEST A DAMAGING WIND 
THREAT MAY EXIST WITH ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT BECOME SEVERE.  HOWEVER 
A LIMITING FACTOR WITH THIS CONVECTION MAY BE AVAILABLE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE. AS A RESULT...THINK THAT BEST CHANCE OF SEEING ANY 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL BE ACROSS THE FAR NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AND WILL LEAVE THE REST OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AS 20 
POPS. THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD REMAIN DRY THIS 
AFTERNOON. 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 17C WILL PRODUCE HIGHS VERY 
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY IN THE UPPER 80S WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND EXTREME NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WHERE ONGOING 
CONVECTION OR CONVECTIVE DEBRIS WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES DOWN IN THE 
LOWER 80S. 

THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT. STRONGER 
MID LEVEL DYNAMICAL FORCING /700-500 Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE/ WILL 
REMAIN NORTH OF THE TENNESSEE/MISSISSIPPI BORDER. ANY POTENTIAL 
SEVERE WEATHER THREAT SHOULD DIMINISH BEFORE MIDNIGHT AS THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER STABILIZES. 

FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT...WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
WITH 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES AROUND 6 C/KM...AND LI/S AROUND 
-4. ANY REMAINING RAIN SHOWERS SHOULD COME TO AN END BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT. HIGHS FRIDAY WILL BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO 70S WITH MOST AREAS 
REACHING HIGHS IN THE MORNING WITH THE EXCEPTION OF PORTIONS OF 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. LOWS WILL DROP BACK INTO THE UPPER 40S TO 
LOWER 50S. 

SATURDAY...THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL BE IN BETWEEN 
SYSTEMS...THE COLD FRONT WHICH WILL PASS THROUGH AND ANOTHER 
CANADIAN FRONT WHICH WILL MOVE THROUGH SUNDAY. 850 MB TEMPERATURES 
AROUND 6-7C WILL PRODUCE HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S AT 
BEST. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A SECONDARY COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE MID SOUTH ON SUNDAY AS A LARGE UPPER LEVEL LOW SPINS 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION/OHIO VALLEY. ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
RAIN SHOWERS TO SATURDAY NIGHT WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND TO

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW ACROSS THE EAST COAST COMPARED TO THE GFS/EURO 
LOW PINWHEELING AROUND THE GREAT LAKES REGION. AS A RESULT...WILL 
STICK TOWARDS GFS/EURO SOLUTION. 

A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR WILL COME WITH THE PASSAGE OF ANOTHER 
COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY. AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER WILL BE TOO DRY FOR RAIN SHOWERS...BUT POSSIBLY A SPRINKLE OR 
TWO ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY EVENING. 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THROUGH THE 
END OF THE PERIOD AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING TRANSLATES EAST FROM THE 
ROCKIES INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. WILL FOLLOW MEX NUMBERS WITH 
DECENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN EURO/GFS.

AGAIN ANOTHER QUIET NIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. DEWPOINTS RUNNING
HIGHER TONIGHT THAN THEY HAVE BEEN FOR SEVERAL DAYS. A LITTLE MORE
DUST IN THE AIR MAY HELP LOWER VISIBILITIES A LITTLE BIT IN FAVORED
PLACES LIKE MKL...BUT NOT ENOUGH TO CAUSE ISSUES.

CURRENT TEMPERATURE TRENDS LOOK OK...MAY EVENTUALLY NEED TO RAISE
LOWS IN EXTREME EAST...BUT DEWPOINTS HAVE HAD A HABIT OF DROPPING
AFTER MIDNIGHT...SO WONT TOUCH FOR NOW. NO UPDATES IMMINENT.

SUNNY SKIES AND WARM TEMPS WERE THE STORY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH
THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPS HAVE CLIMBED ABOVE THE 80 DEGREE MARK WITH
LIGHT SOUTHWEST WINDS. THE WARM WEATHER WILL COME TO AN ABRUPT
A MAJOR PATTERN SHIFT WL OCCUR THIS WEEKEND.

TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY....WARM PATTERN WILL CONTINUE.
SHORTWAVE RIDGE WL BUILD ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT WITH WEAK
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUING ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES.
LIGHT SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL CONT TO BRING HIGHER DEWPOINTS INTO THE
REGION. EXPECT MILD LOWS TONIGHT WITH READINGS IN THE UPPER 50S TO
MID 60S IN MEMPHIS. UPPER RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE MID SOUTH ON
WED. 850 MB TEMPS OF 16-18C INDICATE THE POTENTIAL FOR A VERY WARM

ANOTHER MILD NIGHT WITH TEMPS MAINLY ABOVE 60. UPPER LOW WL MOVE
INTO MO BY LATE THU WITH THE ASSOCD SFC LOW SOUTH OF STL. THU WL
BE THE LAST REALLY WARM DAY FOR A WHILE WITH TEMPS WELL INTO THE

FRI SO WL ADD A SLIGHT CHC POP IN THOSE AREAS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. 
12Z MODELS ARE IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT WITH REGARD TO THIS
SYSTEM. BOTH MODELS INDICATE A LACK OF MOISTURE RETURN IN ADVANCE
OF THE COLD FRONT. AS A RESULT WL KEEP POPS FAIRLY LOW WITH THIS
FRONTAL PASSAGE...MAINLY SLIGHT CHC ACRS SRN SXNS WITH CHC POPS
ACRS NRN HALF.

THE SFC AND UPPER LOW WL TRACK INTO THE OH VALLEY BY 12Z THU WITH
THE COLD FRONT MOVING TO EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE CWFA BY THAT
TIME. SEVERE WEATHER THREAT THU NIGHT APPEARS LIMITED BY THE LACK
OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. COLD FRONT MOVES EAST OF THE REGION
ON FRI AS THE UPPER LOW PHASES WITH A NRN STREAM TROF TO CREATE A
LARGE TROF ACRS THE GREAT LAKES AND OH VALLEY BY SAT MORNING.
COLDER AIR WL MOVE INTO THE MID SOUTH FRI AFTN AND SAT WITH PLENTY

SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY ACRS NE SXNS OF THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH TEMPS
WL PROBABLY OCCUR DURING THE MORNING ON FRIDAY AND RANGE FROM 65-
70 ON SAT.

ON SAT ANOTHER PIECE OF ENERGY COMING OUT OF CANADA WL DROP INTO
THE UPPER TROF OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND CARVE OUT A LARGE UPPER
LOW ACROSS THAT SAME REGION LATE SAT INTO SUN. THIS WL SEND DOWN A
REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR INTO THE MID SOUTH FOR SUN AND MON.
TEMPS ON SUN AND MON WL BE AT LEAST 10-15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL

SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING 
RANGE FROM THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. MAIN CONCERNS THIS FORECAST

NIGHT/FRIDAY MORNING.  

TODAY AND TONIGHT...ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
TODAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 850 MB 
TEMPERATURES AROUND 17C WILL PRODUCE HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 
80S WITH 10 KT WINDS MIXING DOWN TO THE SURFACE BY AFTERNOON.  WINDS 
WILL DECOUPLE AGAIN TONIGHT WITH UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IN PLACE ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH. 

WEDNESDAY...CUT OFF LOW LOCATED OFF THE COAST OF SOUTHWEST 
CALIFORNIA WILL MOVE TOWARDS THE FOUR CORNERS AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING 
BEGINS TO GRADUALLY SHIFT EAST. 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 18C WILL 
PRODUCE NEAR RECORD/RECORD HIGHS ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE AREA. 

THURSDAY AND BEYOND...MID LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. 
GFS/NAM SOMEWHAT SIMILAR WITH TRACK OF LOW PRESSURE ACROSS THE 
MISSOURI VALLEY BUT GFS SOLUTION A BIT STRONGER WITH MID LEVEL 
TROUGH BECOMING NEGATIVELY TILTED. ADJUSTED POPS UP TO LOW END 
CHANCE THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA AS THE COLD

CURRENT MODELS INDICATE A WEATHER SCENARIO ABOUT AS WE ALREADY
HAVE FORECAST FOR THIS WEEK. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE TO
THE EAST OF THE MID-SOUTH THROUGH MID-WEEK ALLOWING WINDS TO TURN
TO THE SOUTHWEST. MEANWHILE...HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WILL SPREAD OVER
THE AREA. THE NAM INDICATES 850 MB TEMPERATURES OF 18 DEGREES CELSIUS
SPREADING INTO THE MID-SOUTH WEDNESDAY. MEAN ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE
WILL REMAIN LOW THROUGH MID-WEEK. AS A RESULT...RAIN-FREE WEATHER
WILL CONTINUE THE FIRST HALF OF THIS WEEK WITH TEMPERATURES
CLIMBING WELL ABOVE NORMAL. IN FACT...AFTERNOON HIGHS WEDNESDAY
ARE FORECAST JUST SHY OF THE 90 DEGREE MARK. THE LATEST DAY OF THE
YEAR THAT IT HAS REACHED 90 DEGREES AT THE MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL
AIRPORT IS OCTOBER 14TH.

THE NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO BE
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY NIGHT. WEAKENING LOW PRESSURE SURFACE
AND ALOFT WILL MOVE INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST THURSDAY NIGHT FROM THE
SOUTHWEST. MEANWHILE...A TRAILING COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO MOVE
INTO EAST AR LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...AND ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH FRIDAY.
THE LATEST GFS IS INDICATING A RATHER VIGOROUS SHORTWAVE MOVING
INTO THE MID-SOUTH FROM THE WEST FRIDAY WITH LIFTED INDICES
FALLING TO BETWEEN MINUS 2 AND MINUS 4. THIS WOULD INDICATE HIGHER
POPS THAN THE 30 PERCENT WE PRESENTLY HAVE GOING. THE ECMWF IS
NOT INDICATING THIS STRONG SHORTWAVE. AS A RESULT...PREFER TO
EXAMINE LATER MODEL RUNS BEFORE RAISING POPS THAT FAR OUT.

IT IS ANOTHER QUIET NIGHT WEATHER-WISE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH.
COOLER AND DRIER AIR IS SPREADING INTO THE MID-SOUTH FROM THE
NORTH. SURFACE DEWPOINTS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE UPPER 30S ACROSS
PARTS OF NORTHEAST AR AND NORTHWEST TN. 

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT CONCERNING MID-SOUTH WEATHER FOR THIS
WEEK. THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN IS NOT EXPECTED UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT
AT THE EARLIEST.

TODAY WILL BE ABOUT 5 TO 7 DEGREES COOLER THAN YESTERDAY AS
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL ALSO EXTEND
ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH WITH THE MEAN ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE REMAINING
VERY LOW. A FEW CIRRUS CLOUDS MAY SPILL INTO THE AREA FROM THE
WEST...BUT OTHERWISE CLEAR SKIES WILL PERSIST.

TONIGHT WILL BE A GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING NIGHT WITH LOW SURFACE
DEWPOINTS...CLEAR SKIES...AND LIGHT WIND.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE TO
OUR SOUTHEAST ALLOWING SURFACE WINDS TO TURN TO THE SOUTHWEST. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE INCREASE WITH UPPER 80S POSSIBLE
ACROSS PARTS OF THE AREA BY MID-WEEK AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES CLIMB
ABOVE PLUS 16 DEGREES CELSIUS.  

THE LATEST RUNS OF THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH A COLD
FRONTAL PASSAGE THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.
MOST OF THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM ARE FORECAST TO
PUSH WELL TO OUR NORTH WITH INSTABLITY LACKING ACROSS OUR AREA.
POPS OF 20 TO 30 PERCENT FROM THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY NIGHT
STILL LOOK GOOD.

.DISCUSSION...

IT IS A TYPICAL MID-OCTOBER NIGHT WEATHER-WISE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH.
SATELLITE SHOWS CLEAR SKIES COVERING MUCH OF THE CONTINENTAL
UNITED STATES INCLUDING THE MID-SOUTH. A LARGE SCALE UPPER LEVEL
RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE NORTHERN ROCKIES
WITH THE MID-SOUTH IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE
IMAGERY INDICATES DRY AIR COVERING THE MID-SOUTH AT THE MID AND
UPPER LEVELS. IN FACT...BASED ON SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...THE DRY
AIR EXTENDS CLOSE TO THE GROUND WITH VISIBILITIES HOLDING CLOSE TO
10 MILES THROUGHOUT THE REGION DESPITE LIGHT WINDS...EVEN AT THE
NORMALLY FOGGY LOCATIONS.

MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT A TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN WILL
CONTINUE THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

CLEAR SKIES WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH A STABLE AND DRY
ATMOSPHERE REMAINING IN PLACE. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...BUT SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL SINK INTO
THE AREA FROM THE NORTH TONIGHT AND SUNDAY COOLING TEMPERATURES
BACK DOWN A FEW DEGREES. THE SURFACE HIGH WILL SLIDE EAST OF THE
MID-SOUTH MONDAY WITH WINDS GRADUALLY TURNING TO THE SOUTHWEST.
THIS WILL ALLOW FOR WARMER TEMPERATURES TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF NEXT
WEEK. A VERY WEAK WEST TO EAST COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO APPROACH
THE NORTHERN BORDER OF THE MID-SOUTH MONDAY NIGHT AND BECOME
STATIONARY. MOISTURE WILL REMAIN TOO LIMITED AND THE ATMOSPHERE
TOO STABLE FOR ANY RAIN FROM THIS FRONT ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH. 

THE NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ABOUT THURSDAY
NIGHT. LOW PRESSURE SURFACE AND ALOFT IS FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE
UPPER MIDWEST THURSDAY. A TRAILING COLD FRONT IS FORECAST BY THE
GFS TO MOVE INTO THE MID-SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH THE ECMWF A
LITTLE FASTER. MOST OF THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS PUSH TO OUR NORTH.
CURRENT FORECAST OF 20 TO 30 PERCENT POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND
FRIDAY LOOKS ALRIGHT FOR NOW. HOPEFULLY...LATER MODELS WILL BECOME
IN BETTER AGREEMENT ON TIMING OF THE FRONT.

MIDDLE AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ARE MOVING ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH EARLY 
THIS MORNING. THESE CLOUDS ARE AHEAD OF AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE
WHICH WILL MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH FROM THE NORTHWEST
TODAY. THINK BY SUNRISE...MOST OF THE CLOUDS WILL BE FROM WEST TN
INTO NORTH MS WITH CLEARING SKIES ACROSS EAST AR AND THE MO
BOOTHEEL. CLEARING SKIES WILL SPREAD OVER ALL THE MID-SOUTH LATER
THIS MORNING AS THE SHORTWAVE MOVES EAST OF THE AREA BY EARLY
AFTERNOON. THE ATMOSPHERE IS TOO STABLE AND MOISTURE IS TOO
LIMITED FOR ANY RAIN TO OCCUR WITH THIS SHORTWAVE. THE CLOUDS HAVE
PREVENTED MUCH FOG FROM FORMING OVERNIGHT...THUS WILL NOT MENTION
IN THE GRIDS THIS MORNING. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOUT LIKE
YESTERDAY...CONTINUING A LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE
YEAR.

ONLY MINOR CHANGES ARE EXPECTED IN OUR WEATHER THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK...MAINLY SMALL VARIATIONS IN TEMPERATURES WITH DRY
WEATHER CONTINUING.

SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS THE
ATMOSPHERE REMAINS STABLE AND DRY. HIGHS WILL BE A DEGREE OR SO
WARMER SATURDAY AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING INCREASES TO OUR WEST.
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH WILL ALLOW COOLER HIGH
PRESSURE TO PUSH INTO THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY
...PROVIDING SOME VERY NICE FALL WEATHER SUNDAY AND MONDAY. BY
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...THE SURFACE FLOW WILL BECOME SOUTHWESTERLY
WITH UPPER LEVEL RIDGING INCREASING ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH. THIS
WILL CAUSE HIGH TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE MIDDLE 80S ACROSS PARTS
OF THE AREA.

THE GFS INDICATES LOW PRESSURE SURFACE AND ALOFT MOVING INTO MO
TOWARD THE SECOND HALF OF NEXT WEEK WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT
MOVING INTO THE MID-SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT. MOST OF THE UPPER LEVEL
DYNAMICS PUSH TO OUR NORTH. FOR NOW WILL CONTINUE WITH THE
PRESENT FORECAST OF 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
FOR THURSDAY.

UPPER 40S TO 50S FOR LOWS.

A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH ON THURSDAY. HAVE ADDED A

WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ALONG WITH AN UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING. THIS HAS
ALLOWED FOR MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND PATCHY FOG...SOME DENSE OVER
EASTERN SECTIONS. PESKY LOW CLOUDS THAT HAVE PLAGUED THE REGION FOR
THE PAST COUPLE OF MORNINGS SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM THIS MORNING...
WITH NAM REGIONAL FORECAST SOUNDINGS DRIER THAN PREVIOUS MORNINGS
IN THE LOW LEVELS WITH ONLY INDICATIONS OF FOG. ONCE THE PATCHY FOG
BURNS OFF BY MID MORNING...EXPECT A PLEASANT FALL DAY WITH MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES AND TEMPERATURES RUNNING ABOUT 3 TO 5 DEGREES ABOVE
AVERAGE. EXPECT SOME HIGH CIRRUS CLOUDS TO DEVELOP OVER THE AREA BY
THIS AFTERNOON AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY
MOVING INTO THE PLAINS STATES THIS MORNING. THESE HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD
REMAIN THIN ENOUGH THOUGH TO WARRANT MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES THROUGH THE
DAY.

THIS SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SOUTHEAST AND ACROSS
THE MID-SOUTH TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD OF THIS
FEATURE APPEARS TO BE NON-EXISTENT...WITH WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATING PLENTY OF MID AND UPPER LEVEL DRY AIR AHEAD OF THIS
SYSTEM...AND LIGHT NORTHERLY SURFACE FLOW KEEPING ANY LOW LEVEL GULF
OF MEXICO MOISTURE LOCKED INTO THE NORTHERN GULF. THEREFORE...WILL
KEEP A DRY FORECAST GOING...WITH THE SHORTWAVE PASSAGE DRY. THIS
UPPER SHORTWAVE WILL ALSO PUSH A VERY WEAK COLD FRONT/SURFACE
TROUGH ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT...WITH LOWER DEWPOINTS NOTED BEHIND
THE FRONT. ANOTHER DRY FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA ON SATURDAY
UNDER DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO BE A
DEGREE OR TWO COOLER ON FRIDAY...AS THE THERMAL TROUGH ALOFT PUSHES
THROUGH...THEN REMAIN STEADY AROUND 80 DEGREES THROUGH THE WEEKEND.
THESE TEMPERATURES ARE STILL ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGES FOR THIS TIME
OF YEAR. WITH THE DRY AIRMASS OVERNIGHT...LOWS WILL STILL COOL BACK
INTO THE 50S THIS WEEKEND. DRY WEATHER IS ALSO EXPECTED...SO A VERY
PLEASANT FALL WEEKEND IS IN STORE.

FOR NEXT WEEK...MODEL GUIDANCE STILL INDICATING THAT UPPER LEVEL
ENERGY CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PACIFIC OCEAN WILL CARVE
OUT A DEEP TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN STATES BY THE END OF THE
WEEKEND...WITH A STRONG UPPER LOW CUTTING OFF OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN
U.S. BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. WITH THESE STRONG HEIGHT FALLS INDICATED
OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES...SHOULD SEE IN RESPONSE SOME UPPER
LEVEL RIDGING DEVELOP FURTHER EAST OVER OUR AREA FOR THE FIRST HALF
OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL PROVIDE CONTINUED DRY AND POSSIBLY SLIGHTLY
WARMER WEATHER FOR THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK. THE CUT OFF LOW IS
THEN FORECAST BY MOST OF THE GLOBAL MODELS TO EJECT OUT TO THE
NORTHEAST BY THE MIDDLE TO END OF NEXT WEEK. THIS SYSTEM MAY BRING
OUR NEXT CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION...BUT IT IS STILL WAY TOO FAR OUT
BEYOND THE EXTENDED FORECAST PERIOD TO PIN ANYTHING DOWN. SO EXTENDED
PERIOD FOR THIS FORECAST SHOULD REMAIN DRY WITH ABOVE SEASONAL
TEMPERATURES.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTHEAST IS ONCE AGAIN KEEPING A
LIGHT NORTHEASTERLY BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW OVER THE MID-SOUTH. LOW
CLOUDS CONFINED MAINLY TO NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA
EARLY THIS MORNING...WITH MID LEVEL CLOUDS STREAMING NORTHEAST
OVER THE AREA IN ADVANCE OF THE UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
LIFTING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES. NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS
A BIT DRIER IN THE LOW LEVELS ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA...AND WITH MID-LEVEL CLOUDS OVERHEAD MAY REDUCE THE
AMOUNT OF LOW CLOUDS OVER JONESBORO TO MEMPHIS TO OXFORD AND
POINTS SOUTHWEST AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. ALSO...SURFACE
TEMPERATURE-DEWPOINT SPREAD A BIT GREATER AS COMPARED TO
YESTERDAY MORNING OVER THE SOUTHWEST HALF. STILL LOOKS AS IF
NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA...INCLUDING JACKSON AND
POINTS NORTHEAST WILL HANG ONTO LOW CLOUDS AGAIN FOR MUCH OF THE
DAY. SKIES SHOULD BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS MOST AREAS BY THIS
AFTERNOON...EXCEPT OVER THE ABOVE MENTIONED NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF
THE AREA. HAVE THEREFORE...WENT NEAR GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES OVER
SOUTHWEST HALF OF AREA...WHERE LOW CLOUDS SHOULD BE LESS OF A
PROBLEM BUT STILL SOME MID LEVEL CLOUDS...AND HAVE GONE BELOW
GUIDANCE IN THE NORTHEAST...WHERE LOW CLOUDS SHOULD BE MOST
PERSISTANT.

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE NORTH-CENTRAL PLAINS STATES TODAY
SHOULD CONTINUE TO LIFT OUT TO THE NORTHEAST AS A SHORTWAVE
DISTURBANCE MOVING THROUGH THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST CONTINUES TO DROP
SOUTHEASTWARD...RECARVING THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS STATES
AND OVER THE MID-SOUTH FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. UNTIL
THEN...EXPECT A FLATTENING UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
TO KEEP DRY WEATHER TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...WITH A BIT WARMER
TEMPERATURES ON THURSDAY. AS THE UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND
VERY WEAK SURFACE COLD FRONT PUSH ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT
INTO FRIDAY...SHOULD BE JUST ENOUGH UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT TO
POSSIBLY SQUEEZE OUT A FEW SHOWERS AND MAYBE AN ELEVATED
THUNDERSTORM. AT THIS POINT...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN LOOKS
LIMITED AT BEST...WITH NORTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW CONTINUING...SO
ANY RAIN ACTIVITY SHOULD BE SPOTTY AND LIGHT...WITH MANY AREAS
REMAINING DRY. BUT STILL FELT THAT A 20 POP WAS WARRENTED AT THIS
POINT...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHERN AREAS WITH DECENT SHORTWAVE
ENERGY PUSHING THROUGH.

ONCE THE END OF THE WEEK SHORTWAVE MOVES EAST...EXPECT SURFACE
HIGH PRESSURE TO MOVE IN FROM THE NORTHWEST WITH DRY NORTHWESTERLY
FLOW ALOFT EXPECTED. NOT MUCH OF A THERMAL PATTERN CHANGE...SO
EXPECT THE WEEKEND TO BE DRY...WITH NEAR SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES.
THE LATEST RUN OF THE GFS HAS FALLEN INTO LINE WITH THE OTHER
GLOBAL MODELS INCLUDING THE ECMWF AND UKMET WITH THE UPPER LEVEL
ENERGY THAT DROPS INTO THE SOUTHWEST U.S. AND CUTS OFF ANOTHER
DEEP UPPER LOW FOR THE BEGINNING TO MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. THIS
MODEL TREND SEEMS MUCH MORE REALISTIC AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAYS
00Z GFS RUN WHICH HAD THE UPPER LOW MUCH FURTHER EAST. THIS WILL KEEP
THE MID-SOUTH UNDER A BUILDING UPPER RIDGE THROUGH MID-WEEK WITH
DRY WEATHER AND NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES
CONTINUING.

SURFACE HIGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES CONTINUES THE NORTHEAST LOW

BURN OFF TODAY...UNDER INVERSION AROUND 900 MB. THIS HAS HELD
TEMPERATURES DOWN CONSIDERABLY IN AREAS THAT HAVE CLOUDS. SOME AREAS
WILL NOT GET OUT OF THE 60S TODAY.

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
WE HAVE HAD PATCHY DENSE FOG EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER THE LAST
2 NIGHTS. AIRMASS HAS NOT CHANGED...SO EXPECT SIMILAR SITUATION
TONIGHT.

NAM HAS HAD A MUCH BETTER HANDLE ON CLOUDS TRAPPED BELOW INVERSION
THAN GFS HAS. NAM MODEL SOUNDINGS FOR MEMPHIS INDICATE THAT CLOUDS
MAY BREAK UP A LITTLE EARLIER TOMORROW THAN TODAY...AND SHOULD NOT
BE A MAJOR ISSUE ON THURSDAY.

UPPER SYSTEM PASSES TO THE NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT INTO
FRIDAY...DRAGGING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA. THIS FRONT WILL
HAVE LITTLE MOISTURE WITH IT. WHILE THERE COULD BE SOME
PRECIPITATION WITH THIS FRONT...CANNOT SEE GOING ANY HIGHER THAN THE
20 POPS ALREADY IN THE FORECAST.

TEMPERATURES...MODELS HAVE NOT HAD A CONSISTENT HANDLE ON TEMPS FOR
THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. TRENDING TOWARD NAM SOLUTION...SINCE THAT
MODEL SEEMS TO BE HANDLING THE CLOUD COVER PROBLEMS BETTER. THAT
MEANS UNDERCUTTING THE MAV ACROSS THE BOARD ON HIGHS UNTIL WE LOSE
THE CLOUDS. THURSDAY AND FRIDAY HIGHS A LITTLE CLOSER TO MAV/MEX

.EARLIER DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 353 AM CDT...

WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO KEEP LIGHT NORTHEASTERLY
BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING. ALSO PLENTY
OF BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE STILL HANGING AROUND...SO LOW STRATUS
DECK HAS ONCE AGAIN FORMED OVER MAINLY NORTHERN AND EASTERN
SECTIONS THIS MORNING. THE MAIN FORECAST QUESTION FOR TODAY WILL
BE TO WHAT EXTENT DO THE LOW CLOUDS DEVELOP OVER THE AREA AND HOW
LONG DO THEY LINGER. IT APPEARS THAT THIS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY
REMAIN TRAPPED UNDER A SUBSIDENCE INVERSION OVER THE AREA THROUGH
MOST OF THE MORNING...AS SHORTWAVE UPPER RIDGING PERSISTS OVER THE
MID-SOUTH TODAY. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT LOW CLOUD DECK WILL BE
MOST PREVALENT OVER THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE AREA THIS MORNING.
LOW CLOUD COVER SHOULD BEGIN TO MIX OUT BY LATE MORNING ACROSS
MANY AREAS...BUT MAY BE STUBBORN TO CLEAR OUT OF FAR NORTHEAST
AREAS EVEN INTO THIS AFTERNOON. THEREFORE...HAVE DECIDED TO GO
MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS MORNING OVER NORTHEAST HALF OF CWA AND EVEN
KEEP MOSTLY CLOUDY ALL DAY FOR FAR NORTHEAST ZONES. FURTHER
SOUTHWEST...ENOUGH DRY AIR SHOULD KEEP SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY...BUT
WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE OUT EVEN OVER THESE AREAS THIS
MORNING...AS ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY BE PRESENT AND WITH
STEEPING LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES BELOW THE INVERSION AFTER SUNRISE
MAY INITIATE SOME LOW CLOUD DEVELOPMENT EVEN OVER THESE AREAS. BUT
CONFIDENCE ON THIS LOW ENOUGH TO GO PARTLY CLOUDY FOR THESE AREAS.
WITH LOW CLOUDS LINGERING IN THE NORTHEAST...HAVE UNDERCUT
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES BY A FEW DEGREES HERE. ELSEWHERE...HAVE
GONE CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS.

ONCE LOW CLOUDS BURN OFF IN MOST AREAS...SHOULD BE A DECENT
AFTERNOON WITH DRY CONDITIONS AS THE UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE RIDGING
PERSISTS OVER THE REGION...ALONG WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AT THE
SURFACE. THROUGH MID WEEK...A DEEP CUTOFF UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM NOW OVER THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES WILL BEGIN TO LIFT OUT TO
THE NORTHEAST AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH DIGS INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST.
THIS SHORTWAVE ENERGY SHOULD THEN DROP INTO THE BASE OF THE PLAINS
STATES UPPER TROUGH AND MOVE ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND
FRIDAY. UNTIL THEN...EXPECT DRY CONDITIONS WITH PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES AND SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. AS THE
UPPER SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED WEAK SURFACE FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE
AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING...THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. STILL LOOKS LIKE DEEP
MOISTURE IN ADVANCE OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BE LIMITED...SO IT LOOKS
LIKE 20 POPS AT BEST. WILL LEAVE THIS IN THE FORECAST FOR NOW
UNTIL WE GET CLOSER TO THE EVENT AND RESOLVE MOISTURE QUESTIONS.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN ONCE AGAIN BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR THE
WEEKEND...WITH DRY WEATHER AND SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES. FOR THE
FAR EXTENDED PERIOD...INTO THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...STILL MANY
MODEL DIFFERENCES WITH RESPECT TO THE MEDIUM RANGE MODEL
GUIDANCE...WITH 00Z GFS DEVELOPING A DEEP CUTOFF UPPER LOW OVER

.SYNOPSIS...
SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN RATHER WEAK ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH AT MIDDAY.
UPPER LOW LIFTING AWAY TO THE NORTHEAST FROM KENTUCKY...WITH
STRONG UPPER SYSTEM CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES.

INVERSION BETWEEN 850 AND 900 MB HAS MOISTURE TRAPPED BELOW IT...
LEAVING CONSIDERABLE STRATUS ACROSS THE AREA. THIS HAS HELD
TEMPERATURES BELOW FORECAST LEVELS BY AS MUCH AS 10 DEGREES. SEEING
SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS...BUT IT IS ALREADY 18Z...SO SOME AREAS
WILL NOT CLEAR COMPLETELY...NOR REACH THEIR FORECAST HIGHS.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH THURSDAY)...
NAM MODEL SOUNDINGS HAVE BEEN HANDLING INVERSION AND ASSOCIATED
STRATUS BETTER THAN GFS THIS MORNING. THE NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS
WOULD INDICATE THAT TUESDAY WILL BE A REPLAY OF WHAT IS GOING ON
TODAY. STRATUS LATE TONIGHT...AND TAKING MOST OF TUESDAY TO BREAK
UP AGAIN. THIS WOULD HOLD TEMPERATURES BELOW MAV GUIDANCE. WONT GO
QUITE AS LOW AS THE MET GUIDANCE YET...BUT TREND IT THAT WAY.

UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN ROCKIES LIFTS INTO THE DAKOTAS BY
WEDNESDAY MORNING...KEEPING PRECIPITATION WELL TO OUR WEST. SOUNDINGS
ON WEDNESDAY NOT QUITE AS BULLISH ON LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEING TRAPPED
UNDER THE INVERSION. A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE OF SUNSHINE THAN TODAY OR
TOMORROW. CURRENT FORECAST TEMPS FOR WEDNESDAY ABOUT A CATEGORY BELOW
MAV GUIDANCE...AND WILL HOLD IT THERE. NAM WOULD ARGUE FOR LOWERING
EVEN FURTHER.

UPPER TROF TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA LATE THURSDAY. MINOR TIMING
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MODELS. NAM A LITTLE SLOWER. WE CURRENTLY HAVE
MENTION OF PRECIPITATION IN FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...AND NOT
ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO MOVE AWAY FROM THIS FORECAST. THURSDAY PROBABLY
THE WARM DAY OF THE WEEK.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER THURSDAY)...
CURRENT GFS RUN SUPP0RTS GOING FORECAST THROUGH ABOUT SATURDAY...WITH
UPPER RIDGE OVER THE CENTER OF THE COUNTRY. AFTER THAT...GFS SEEMS
TO GET LOST...EVENTUALLY DEVELOPING A STRONG UPPER LOW OVER MISSOURI
BY NEXT MONDAY EVENING. THIS SOLUTION IS NOT SUPPORTED BY THE 00Z
RUN OF THE ECMWF...THE 06Z DGEX...THE CANADIAN MODEL...OR BY PREVIOUS
RUNS OF THE GFS. AFTER SATURDAY...12Z RUN OF GFS DISCOUNTED FOR THIS
FORECAST PERIOD. MOST MEDIUM RANGE MODELS INDICATE THAT IF THERE IS
GOING TO BE A CLOSED LOW OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE U.S...PROBABLY
WONT BE BEFORE THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

UPPER RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE EAST HALF OF THE U.S. THROUGH NEXT
MONDAY. AFTER THE CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION EARLY IN THE EXTENDED
PERIOD...THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...NO PRECIPITATION EXPECTED.
HAVE TRENDED WEEKEND MAXES UP A LITTLE BIT...BUT NOT TO POINT OF MEX

EVENING IS STILL RAINFALL POTENTIAL.

WSR-88D RADAR TRENDS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS HAVE SHOWN A DECREASE 
IN RETURNS WITH SPRINKLES AT BEST ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHERN 
MISSISSIPPI WITH LOW LEVEL DRY AIR IN PLACE ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. SEE NO REASON AT THIS TIME TO REMOVE SPRINKLES FROM 
FORECAST WITH SOME MID LEVEL MOISTURE PRESENT...700-500 MB LAYER 
LAPSE RATES AROUND 6 C/KM...AND SOME UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH. WILL ISSUE AN UPDATE TO ADJUST CLOUD COVER FOR 
CURRENT TRENDS WITH MOST AREAS ALREADY BECOMING CLOUDY/MOSTLY 
CLOUDY. TEMPERATURES LOOK OKAY AND WILL MAKE ONLY MINOR TWEAKS. 

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 308 PM CDT SAT OCT 8 2005...

AN UPPER VORT MAX IS OVER EASTERN TEXAS. MID LEVEL MOISTURE IS
ADVANCING INTO THE MID SOUTH AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. RADAR HAS
DETECTED A FEW ECHOS BUT THE SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT THE LOW LEVELS
ARE EXTREMELY DRY SO DO NOT EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN SPRINKLES FROM
THESE RETURNS. THE RETURNS ARE DUE TO AN AREA OF LIFT CAUSED BY
UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE AHEAD OF THE VORT.

THE UPPER VORT WILL SWING THROUGH THE REGION ON SUNDAY. LOW LEVELS
STILL LOOK RATHER DRY SO DO NOT EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN A FEW
SPRINKLES AROUND DURING THE DAY. BOTH GFS/NAM SHOW ENOUGH MID
LEVEL MOISTURE TO SUPPORT MOSTLY CLOUDY FORECAST OVER MUCH OF THE
REGION. CLOUD COVER WILL LIKELY KEEP TEMPS IN THE MID TO UPPER
60S. 

CLEARING SKIES ARE EXPECTED TOMORROW NIGHT AS THE VORT MOVES AWAY
FROM THE REGION AND A SHORTWAVE RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA. THE
MET GUIDANCE IS NOTABLY COOLER AND NOTABLY CLOUDIER. THE NAM HAS A
GREAT AMOUNT OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LINGERING OVER THE AREA AND
LOOKS EXTREMELY DUBIOUS. FAVOR MAV GUIDANCE WHICH APPEARS TO
HANDLE THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FIELDS MUCH BETTER. 

ON WEDNESDAY...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION.
MOISTURE RETURN IS A PROBLEM AND RAIN CHANCES APPEAR TO BE TOO LOW
TO YET MENTION IN THE FORECAST. HIGH PRESSURE WILL PROVIDE DRY
WEATHER AND NEAR NORMAL TEMPS FOR LATE WEEK.

EXPECT ANOTHER DAY WITH HIGHS MAINLY IN THE UPPER 60S...WHICH IS
ABOUT 8-10 DEGREES COOLER THAN NORMAL.

TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...UPPER LOW MOVES INTO THE DELTA AND ACROSS THE

INSUFFICIENT FOR ANY PRECIP. MOS NUMBERS LOOK FINE WITH READINGS
IN THE 46-51 DEGREE RANGE TONIGHT. WITH LOWER HEIGHTS AND SOME

MONDAY AND TUESDAY...UPPER LOW PULLS TO THE NORTHEAST WHILE A WEAK UPPER
RIDGE BUILDS ACRS THE REGION. VERY DRY AIRMASS BUILDS INTO THE
REGION RESULTING IN PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND WARMER TEMPS. HIGH TEMPS WL

LOW STRATUS WILL LIKELY HANG ON SOUTHEAST OF TUPELO INTO THE

RESPECT TO CLOUD COVER AS THE MOISTURE AXIS THAT IS CURRENTLY OVER

DRY WEATHER AND GRADUAL WARMING TREND SHOULD CONTINUE INTO MID
WEEK AS A SHORTWAVE RIDGE MOVES OVER THE REGION. A WEAK COLD FRONT
ASSOCIATED WITH A SHORTWAVE MOVING OUT FROM A DEEP TROUGH OVER THE

MID SOUTH WAS CAUGHT BETWEEN STACKED LOW PRESSURE ACROSS THE
SOUTHEAST U.S. AND AN UPPER TROF THE PLAINS THIS MORNING. CLOUDS COVER
MOST OF THE ERN HALF OF THE CWA WITH PARTLY CLOUDY CONDS ALONG THE
RIVER AND TO THE WEST. BRISK NORTHERLY WINDS WERE USHERING IN
COOL...DRY AIR WITH TEMPS IN THE 50S THIS MORNING.

TODAY...LOW PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. TODAY WHILE THE
UPPER TROF MOVES ACRS THE CNTRL STATES. THE NORTHERN PART OF THIS
TROF WL MOVE INTO THE OH VALLEY WHILE THE SOUTHERN PART...LOCATED
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS BY 00Z...IS IMPEDED BY THE SYSTEM OVER
THE SOUTHEAST. AS A RESULT A CLOSED LOW FORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS TONIGHT. 1000-500MB MOISTURE FIELDS INDICATE A GOOD DEAL OF
CLOUDINESS ACRS ERN SXNS TODAY WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES FROM THE
RIVER TO THE WEST. TEMPS WL REMAIN QUITE COOL UNDER BRISK
NORTHERLY WINDS...READINGS WL BE IN THE MID 60S.

TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...AN UPPER LOW WL MOVE SLOWLY ACRS
THE REGION DURING THE TIME FRAME AS A STRONG UPPER LOW PUSHES
INTO THE WESTERN PLAINS. EXPECT COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPS AND
PERIODS OF CLOUDS AND SUN. NOT ENUF LIFT AND MOISTURE FOR PRECIP
WITH THIS SYSTEM. DECENT SFC GRADIENT ACRS THE AREA TONIGHT WL
KEEP TEMPS FROM FREE FALLING.

MONDAY AND TUESDAY...WEAK UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE REGION AFTER
THE UPPER LOW EXITS AND IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVING INTO
THE PLAINS. VERY DRY AIRMASS BUILDS IN WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF
CLOUD COVER. A WARMING TREND WL RESULT IN HIGH TEMPS IN THE MID
AND UPPER 70S BOTH DAYS.

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...UPPER RIDGE MOVES EAST AS NEXT TROF MOVES
INTO THE MS RIVER VALLEY. GFS INDICATES A LACK OF MOISTURE AND
DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM AND A WEAK FRONTAL PASSAGE. AT THIS TIME
WL CONT DRY AND MILD FORECAST.

THE EASTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA IS SANDWICHED BETWEEN THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE COLD FRONT AND THE INFLUENCE FROM THE SOUTHEAST 
U.S. TROPICAL SYSTEM. THIS HAS CAUSED SINKING AIR ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
PARTS OF NORTH MISSISSIPPI. MOST OF THE VERY LIGHT/WEAK ECHOS THAT 
WERE OCCURRING OVER ALABAMA HAS DISSIPATED. THIS WILL SQUASH ANY 
CHANCES THE EASTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA HAD FOR 
MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION OVERNIGHT. THUS THE FORECAST WILL BE 
UPDATED TO ACCOUNT FOR A SLIGHT CHANGE IN CLOUD COVER AND THE 
REMOVAL OF RAIN CHANCES. MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS WILL EXIST FOR THE 
MAJORITY OF THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED.

SURFACE COLD FRONT HAS BECOME NEARLY INDISTINGUISHABLE ACROSS THE 
REGION. IT MAY LIE BETWEEN THE NORTHEASTERLY WINDS OVER NORTHEAST MS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMNANTS OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION TAMMY AND THE 
NORTHWESTERLY WINDS OVER THE REST OF THE REGION. THE CENTER OF WHAT 
REMAINS OF TAMMY IS NOW OVER THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. SATELLITE HAS 
SHOWN A LOW STRATUS DECK PROGRESSIVELY MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS 
THE REGION. THIS DECK HAS BEGUN TO BREAK UP IN THE AFTERNOON 
HEATING. MEANWHILE CLOUDS ARE SLOWLY WORKING INTO NORTHEAST MS FROM 
THE EAST...THIS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL SYSTEM. THE GFS/NAM 
APPEAR TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH THE AMOUNT OF RAIN MOVING ACROSS 
NORTH ALABAMA AND INTO NORTHEAST MS THIS AFTERNOON. THE RUC HAS HAD 
THE BEST HANDLE ON THIS SITUATION. FEEL THAT THE BEST CHANCES FOR 
RAIN TONIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WILL BE JUST WEST OF THE TENNESSEE 
RIVER. EVEN AT THAT RAIN AMOUNTS SHOULD BE UNIMPRESSIVE MAYBE A FEW 
HUNDREDTHS AT BEST. DUE TO THE MIXING OF THE LOW STRATUS THAT HAS 
OCCURRED THIS AFTERNOON AND CONTINUED ADVECTION OF DRIER AIR FROM 
THE NORTHWEST...FEEL THAT THE ONLY AREAS THAT MAY BE CLOUDY ARE 
AREAS NEAR AND EAST OF JACKSON TO OXFORD. THIS CLOUD COVER WILL BE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL SYSTEM. NO MAJOR CHANGES MADE TO 
FORECAST LOWS.

UPPER TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD FRONT SHOULD PROGRESS ACROSS 
THE AREA TOMORROW. THIS SHOULD LIFT ANY LINGERING CLOUD COVER FROM 
TAMMY AWAY FROM THE REGION BY AFTERNOON. MAV IS ABOUT 5 DEGREES 
WARMER THAN MET/FWC GUIDANCE ACROSS THE REGION BEGINNING TOMORROW 
NIGHT. ALTHOUGH THE MODELS ARE SIMILAR IN THEIR HANDLING OF 850 
TEMPS THEY ARE QUITE DIFFERENT IN TERMS OF 1000MB TEMPS. THIS 
INDICATES A DISAGREEMENT IN THE STRENGTH OF THE SHALLOW COLD POOL. 
GIVEN THE TIME OF YEAR YET...FEEL THAT THE NAM MAY BE TOO AGGRESSIVE 
IN THE SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF THE COLD AIR. 

MODELS INDICATE A STRONG VORT MOVING THROUGH THE REGION FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST ON SUNDAY. THIS VORT IS EXPECTED TO FORM IN THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS TOMORROW. IT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH THAT 
WILL MOVE THROUGH OUR REGION TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THIS VORT WILL 
BECOME CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW AND WILL BE EJECTED OUT AS A 
STRONG UPPER TROUGH DIGS INTO THE WESTERN US. 850-500MB MOISTURE IS 
EXTREMELY DRY SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY RAINFALL FROM THIS VORT. 

A GRADUAL WARMING IS EXPECTED THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK AS THE UPPER 
FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY IN RESPONSE TO THE WESTERN U.S. TROUGH. 
GFS IS ADVERTISING A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH AROUND MID WEEK 
BUT WITH LITTLE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH.

SURFACE COLD FRONT HAS BECOME NEARLY INDISTINGUISHABLE ACROSS THE 
REGION. THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION TAMMY HAS MOVED INTO 
SOUTHEASTERN ALABAMA. AS A RESULT WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT ARE OUT 
OF THE NORTH AS WELL. SATELLITE HAS SHOWN A LOW STRATUS DECK 
PROGRESSIVELY MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE REGION. THIS DECK IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH SIGNIFICANT COLD AIR ADVECTING INTO THE REGION. 
TEMPS ACROSS EASTERN ARKANSAS AND EXTREME WESTERN TENNESSEE HAVE 
LIKELY ALREADY SEEN THEIR HIGHS FOR THE DAY AND TEMPS WILL HOLD IN 
THE 65 TO 70 DEGREE RANGE. TO FURTHER COMPLICATE MATTERS...MODELS 
SHOW MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE RIVER 
THIS AFTERNOON. BASED UPON SATELLITE TRENDS...EXPECT THIS MOISTURE 
TO HOLD OFF TILL LATE THIS AFTERNOON. IN THE AREAS IN THE 
MIDDLE...NAMELY FROM OXFORD TO AROUND BOLIVAR. EXPECT CLOUDS TO 
GRADUALLY WORK IN FROM ONE OF THE TWO DIRECTIONS SOMETIME LATER IN 
THE AFTERNOON. PROBABLY LATE ENOUGH IN THESE AREAS TO JUSTIFY PARTLY 
CLOUDY WORDING. AHEAD OF THE LOW STRATUS...SUN WILL LIKELY WARM 
TEMPS INTO THE LOW TO MID 80S. FEEL THAT SIGNIFICANT RAIN ALONG THE

COLD FRONT BEGINNING TO MOVE THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING.
NO RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT AND NONE IS EXPECTED AS THE FRONT
CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. TROPICAL STORM TAMMY CONTINUES
TO PUSH NORTHWEST THROUGH SOUTHERN GEORGIA. RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH
TAMMY AS FAR WEST AS SOUTHERN ALABAMA. THE QUESTION IS WHEN TAMMY
WILL BEGIN TO MAKE A TURN TO THE NORTH. CURRENT FORECAST HAS TAMMY
CONTINUING TO MOVE NORTHWEST THROUGH TONIGHT. THAT MEANS THAT THERE
IS A POSSIBILITY OF SOME THE RAIN FROM TAMMY REACHING THE EASTERN
PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL PUT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER PART OF
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI FOR THIS AFTERNOON. FOR TONIGHT WILL PUT IN
CHANCE POPS OVER NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN
EASTERN SECTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE. COOLER AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND
THE FRONT LATE TODAY BEHIND SOME BRISK NORTH WINDS. HOWEVER WITH THE
COOLER AIR TAKING A LITTLE LONGER TO GET HERE THAN EARLIER
FORECASTED...TEMPERATURES TODAY MAY BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN
EARLIER FORECASTED WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 70S TO LOWER 80S ACROSS THE
REGION. COOL WEATHER SHOULD HOLD ON FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND
BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD OVER

A PATTERN CHANGE WILL SOON COMMENCE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL
BRING A RETURN TO FALL LIKE WEATHER. THE MAIN FORECASTS CONCERNS
FOR THIS PACKAGE ARE PRECIP CHANCES WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AND
THE TIMING OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE COLDER AIR.

&&

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
AS OF 19Z...A STRONG COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM WESTERN WISCONSIN
SOUTH TO NORTH CENTRAL TEXAS. THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH
TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH OVERNIGHT. THE ACTUAL PRESSURE TROUGH WILL
LIKELY CLEAR THE REGION BY 12Z...HOWEVER THE TEMPERATURE/DEWPOINT
GRADIENT WILL LACK A FEW HOURS BEHIND. HAVE DECIDED TO TAKE OUT
ALL MENTION OF PRECIP. ALL THE DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE WILL REMAIN WELL TO THE NORTH. IN
ADDITION...700 MB RH LEVELS WILL REMAIN LESS THAN 40 PERCENT.
THESE FACTORS COMBINED WITH LITTLE SURFACE CONVERGENCE ALONG THE
FRONT...MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES OF LESS THAN 6 C/KM...AND LITTLE TO
NO INSTABILITY PAINT A VERY DRY PICTURE FOR THE MIDSOUTH. AS FAR
AS TEMPS ARE CONCERNED...WENT ABOVE MAV GUIDANCE FOR OVERNIGHT
LOWS. WITH THE TEMP GRADIENT AND SIGNIFICANT COLD AIR ADVECTION
NOT ARRIVING TILL AFTER 12Z...DO NOT SEE HOW WE COOL DOWN TOO
MUCH.

TEMPERATURES DURING THE DAY THURSDAY WILL BE TRICKY AND WILL
DEPEND GREATLY ON THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER. GFS 925-850MB RH
FIELDS SUGGEST A SIGNIFICANT POST FRONTAL STRATUS FIELD SHOULD
ENTER THE MIDSOUTH. THIS WOULD TEND TO KEEP HIGHS BELOW MAV
GUIDANCE VALUES. THE FORECAST WILL REFLECT THIS THINKING...WITH
AREAS DOWN AROUND TUPELO SEEING THE BEST OPPORTUNITY FOR HEATING
BEFORE THE CAA ARRIVES. ONE THING THAT WILL BE MORE CERTAIN IS
THAT A STRONG NORTHERLY WIND WILL BE FELT ACROSS THE AREA
TOMORROW. WINDS OF 15-20MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS WILL BE COMMON. THIS
IS DUE TO A LARGE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDING SOUTH AND THE COMBINATION OF THE REMNANTS OF T.S. TAMMY
AND DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE OVER THE NE GULF. 

ONE THING TO NOTE ABOUT THE LOW OVER THE NE GULF. MODELS ARE ALL
OVER THE PLACE IN REGARDS TO THE TRACK OF T.S. TAMMY AND THE LOW
THAT DEVELOPS OVER THE NE GULF. THE NAM SOLUTION HAS BEEN
COMPLETELY DISCOUNTED AS IT IS NOT A RELIABLE TROPICAL MODEL. THE
GFS IS PREFERRED HERE AS IT HAS BEEN THE MORE CONSISTENT SOLUTION.
IT KEEPS ALL TROPICAL ACTIVITY WELL TO OUR EAST. THE ECMWF IS A
LITTLE FURTHER WEST WITH THE LOW AND WOULD RESULT IN POSSIBLE RAIN
CHANCES OVER NE MISSISSIPPI LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...HOWEVER
ITS INITIALIZATION OF THE SFC FEATURES ARE SUSPECT. WILL KEEP THE
FORECAST DRY FOR NOW AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR DEVELOPMENTS IN THE
EASTERN GULF.

THE HEART OF THE COLDER AIR WILL ENTRENCH ITSELF INTO THE CWA
THURSDAY NIGHT. TEMPS WILL BE BELOW NORMAL THURS NIGHT AND FRIDAY.

&&

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
TRANQUIL WEATHER FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST. TEMPERATURES WILL
REMAIN BELOW NORMAL FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND AND WILL
SLOWLY WARM TO NEAR CLIMO LEVELS BY WEDNESDAY. DID UNDERCUT
GUIDANCE ON TEMPS. APPEARS AS IF THE GFS IS MODIFYING THE AIRMASS
TOO QUICKLY GIVEN THE LACK OF A RETURN FLOW (WINDS WILL STAY NORTHEAST
TO EAST THROUGH THE PERIOD.) HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE WITH NO
RAIN IN SIGHT.

THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE THAT HAS DOMINATED THE MIDSOUTH WEATHER IS
BEGINNING TO WEAKEN...AS SEEN IN THE HEIGHT FALLS IN AREA RAOB
SOUNDINGS. THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO A STRONG NORTHERN STREAM
SHORTWAVE LOCATED OVER THE HIGH PLAINS THAT CONTINUES TO PROGRESS
EASTWARD. ITS ASSOCIATED STRONG COLD FRONT CURRENTLY EXTENDS FROM
MINNESOTA SOUTH TO THE TX PANHANDLE. THE FRONT WILL NOT ARRIVE IN

CURRENT FORECAST IS IN GOOD SHAPE FOR OUR AREA AND ONLY A MINOR
TWEAK TO AFTERNOON HIGHS WERE MADE. TEMPS ARE RUNNING VERY SIMILAR
TO YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME...AND SO ARE 850 MB TEMPS OF AROUND 16C.
THIS WILL PROMOTE HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S AREA WIDE...THUS HAVE
TAKEN OUT MENTION OF LOWER 90S ACROSS SW ZONES. CU FIELD SHOULD
DEVELOP BY EARLY AFTERNOON WITH CONVECTIVE TEMPS IN THE MID 80S

NOT MUCH CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PATTERN IN THE LAST 24 HOURS WITH
SURFACE HIGH OVER THE NORTHEAST U.S. AND COLD FRONT ONLY MAKING
SMALL PROGRESS EAST NOW INTO CENTRAL KANSAS. VERY LITTLE RAIN CAN BE
FOUND AHEAD OF THE FRONT THIS MORNING. THE FRONT SHOULD BEGIN TO
MOVE FASTER TODAY AND TONIGHT BUT SHOULD REMAIN WELL NORTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA BEFORE 00Z SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR
TODAY. COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE REGION BEGINNING AROUND
MIDNIGHT AND CONTINUING THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED AT THIS POINT TO SEE NO RAIN WITH THE FRONT BUT NOT
COMFORTABLE GOING COMPLETELY DRY SO WILL LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
ALONE FOR TONIGHT AND FOR THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST ON THURSDAY MORNING.

COOLER AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE FRONT ON THURSDAY AS CANADIAN
HIGH SETTLES INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS. IT APPEARS THAT THURSDAY
WONT BE QUITE AS COOL AS PREVIOUS THOUGHT AS HIGH WILL NOT MOVED
CLOSE ENOUGH TO OUR REGION YET BUT TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE SOME
10-15 DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY.

NAM MODEL HAS DIFFICULTY DEALING WITH THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE WHICH
IS FORECAST TO MOVE ACROSS FLORIDA TODAY AND TONIGHT. MOST OF THE
OTHER MODELS BRING THE DISTURBANCE NORTH INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE
AND THEN NORTHEAST INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. THE NAM TRIES TO
KEEP THIS DISTURBANCE OVER THE GULF AREA AND SPREAD CLOUDS AND RAIN
OVER THE REGION FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. SINCE NAM SEEMS TO BE
THE ONLY MODEL FOLLOWING THIS SCENARIO IT WAS IGNORED FOR THAT PART
OF THE FORECAST.

FRIDAY SHOULD BE THE COOLEST DAY AS SURFACE HIGH ALMOST DUE NORTH OF
THE FORECAST AREA. BY SATURDAY WINDS WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT BACK TOWARD
THE SOUTH AND A SLOW GRADUAL WARMUP WILL BEGIN AND CONTINUE THROUGH
THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGE PERSISTS OVER THE MIDSOUTH THIS AFTERNOON
PROVIDING DRY WEATHER AND WARM TEMPS. AS OF 19Z...TEMPS ARE IN THE
MID TO UPPER 80S ACROSS THE REGION WITH DEWPOINTS A LITTLE LOWER
THAN THEY WERE YESTERDAY. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THIS PACKAGE
ARE PRECIP CHANCES WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WITH A FRONTAL
PASSAGE.

&&

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
LITTLE TO TALK ABOUT IN THE NEAR TERM. HIGH PRESSURE HOLDS ON FOR
ONE MORE NIGHT WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS EXPECTED FOR LOWS. WITH
DEWPOINTS RUNNING A LITTLE LOWER THAN LAST NIGHT...DECIDED TO
LEAVE OUT THE MENTION OF PATCHY FOG. HOWEVER...WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED IF THE USUAL SUSPECTS DID SEE A LITTLE FOG OVERNIGHT.

ON WEDNESDAY...UPPER HIGH BREAKS DOWN IN RESPONSE TO A STRONG
NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE. THIS FEATURE WILL PUSH A STRONG COLD
FRONT THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DEEP LAYER MOISTURE
LOOKS VERY INEFFICIENT FOR MUCH PRECIP. THE STRONG SHORTWAVE AND
ASSOCIATED JET MAX WILL REMAIN WELL TO THE NORTH. IN
ADDITION...CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT LOOKS POOR WITH MODELS
SHOWING A NORTHEAST WIND AHEAD OF THE FRONT. ALL THIS BOILS DOWN
TO A REDUCTION IN POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ALSO
REMOVED MENTION OF THUNDER DUE TO LITTLE IF ANY INSTABILITY AND
MEAGER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES.

MODELS IN AGREEMENT THAT THE FRONT SHOULD BE EAST OF THE AREA BY
THURSDAY MORNING...WITH A STRONG NORTH WIND DEVELOPING IN
ASSOCIATION WITH A 1035 MB HIGH DROPPING SOUTH OUT OF CANADA. DID
RAISE TEMPS A COUPLE OF CATEGORIES ON THURSDAY AS THE HEART OF THE
COLD AIR WILL BE DELAYED IN ARRIVING UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT. THE
OTHER FLY IN THE OINTMENT IS THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM OVER THE EASTERN GULF. MODELS VARY IN STRENGTH AND LOCATION
OF THIS SYSTEM. IF THE LOW DEVELOPS FAR ENOUGH TO THE NORTH...IT
COULD BRING SOME MOISTURE UP AND OVER THE FRONTAL SURFACE INTO NE
MS. THEREFORE...LEFT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN FOR THOSE AREAS. TOO
MUCH UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH THIS FEATURE WITH A LARGE SPREAD IN
THE GLOBAL MODELS. THEREFORE...WILL TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH.

&&

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING BELOW NORMAL TEMPS TO THE
MIDSOUTH THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH A SLOW MODERATION IN TEMPS BY
TUESDAY. NO RETURN FLOW IS EXPECTED...WITH NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS
PREVAILING. COULD BE QUITE BREEZY ON FRIDAY WITH THE DEVELOPING
LOW OVER THE EAST GULF AND HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE PLAINS CAUSING A

A DEVELOPING RIDGE BOTH SFC AND ALOFT WILL EXTEND FROM MID ATL 
STATES INTO TX FROM TODAY THROUGH MUCH OF WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL 
PROVIDE A WARM LATE SUMMER PATTERN ACROSS THE FCST AREA THROUGH THE 
FIRST HALF OF THE WEEK. THE RIDGE WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO SUPPRESS 
DIURNAL CONVECTION.

A COLD FRONT OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL PART OF THE US WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE FCST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL PROVIDE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO A PART OF 
THURSDAY. MUCH COOLER WEATHER WILL FOLLOW THE FRONT UNDER GUSTY 
NORTHERLY WINDS.

A POLAR HIGH WELL TO THE NORTH WILL DOMINATE THE FCST AREA FRIDAY

A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS
AFTERNOON ON THE BACK EDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR THE
VIRGINIA/CAROLINA COAST. MEANWHILE AN UPPER LEVEL LOW LOCATED IN THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL WEAKEN AND MOVE INTO THE UPPER/MIDDLE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THROUGH SUNDAY. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS
PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...AND AGAIN ON
WEDNESDAY WITH PASSAGE OF NEXT COLD FRONT.

TONIGHT...INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WILL MOVE NORTH OF THE FORECAST
AREA. MODEL CONVECTIVE FIELDS PRODUCE 1000 J/KG CAPE...LI/S AROUND
-3 AND WEAK LOW/MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES.  SURFACE DEWPOINTS THIS
AFTERNOON HAVE QUICKLY RECOVERED INTO THE 60S TO LOWER 70S WITH THE
RETURN OF SOUTHWEST FLOW. WEAK ISOLATED DAYTIME CONVECTION
WHICH DEVELOPED MAINLY ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AS
NOTED BY KNQA/KGWX 88D RADARS SHOULD CONTINUE AT LEAST UNTIL SUNSET
AND DIMINISH WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME INSTABILITY. WILL CARRY
ISOLATED POPS ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND A PORTION OF WESTERN
TENNESSEE THROUGH EARLY EVENING.

SUNDAY...ANOTHER WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WILL AFFECT THE MID
SOUTH. MODEL SOUNDINGS PRODUCE 1500 J/KG SURFACE BASED CAPE...LI/S
AROUND -5...BUT CANNOT JUSTIFY RAISING POPS ANY HIGHER THAN
SLIGHT CHANCE AT THIS TIME WITH LOW/MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES REMAINING
PRETTY WEAK AROUND 5 C/KM AND BETTER FORCING NORTH ACROSS THE
MIDDLE/UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ASSOCIATED WITH A MID LEVEL TROUGH.
850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 16C WILL PRODUCE HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE TO
UPPER 80S ACROSS THE MID SOUTH.

MONDAY AND TUESDAY...LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL REMAIN IN
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. DAYTIME INSTABILITY WILL BE PRESENT WITH CAPES
AROUND 1500 J/KG...AND LI/S AROUND -3. PROBABILITIES ARE TOO LOW AT
THIS TIME TO JUSTIFY A MENTION OF CONVECTION IN FORECAST.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...MODELS HAVE BEEN TRENDING A BIT FASTER

WEDNESDAY. EUROPEAN SOLUTION HAS BEEN TRENDING LESS AMPLIFIED WITH
THE TROUGH WHEN COMPARED TO THE GFS. CURRENT MODEL TRENDS SUGGEST

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING CENTERS HIGH PRESSURE 
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS 
MORNING ARE PRIMARILY IN THE 60S WITH VISIBLE SATELLITE DEPICTING 
SUNNY SKIES. CURRENT FORECAST HANDLED WELL IN FORECAST GRIDS AND 
WILL NOT ISSUE AN UPDATE AT THIS TIME.

CJC

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 245 AM CDT FRI SEP 30 2005...

HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED INTO THE REGION EARLY THIS MORNING. CLEAR
SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS HAVE ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE MID
40S TO MID 50S ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES WILL BE SUNNY TODAY
WHICH ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE MID TO UPPER 70S. TONIGHT
SHOULD BE CLEAR AGAIN BUT NOT NEARLY AS COOL. THE SURFACE HIGH WILL
MOVE TO THE EAST BY SATURDAY BRINGING A RETURN TO SOUTHERLY WINDS
WHICH WILL HELP WARM THINGS UP SOME MORE WITH HIGHS ON SATURDAY IN
THE LOW TO MID 80S. UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL TRACK ACROSS MISSOURI ON
SUNDAY SO HAVE KEPT 20 POPS IN THE FORECAST. NEXT CHANCE AT A COLD
FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE REGION WILL BE WEDNESDAY. EXTENDED MODELS
ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT AS TO THE TIMING OF THE FRONT SO DECIDED TO
LEAVE THAT PART OF THE FORECAST ALONE FOR NOW. ONCE THE FRONT MOVES
THROUGH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AGAIN AND NEXT WEEKEND IS LOOKING TO
BE PRETTY NICE.

SFC DEWPOINTS HAVE CLIMBED INTO THE MID AND UPPER 60S. THE FRONT
WL MOVE QUICKLY INTO NE AR EARLY THIS EVENING. STRONG LIFTING IN
ADVANCE OF THE VIGOROUS SHORTWAVE AND ALONG THE SURFACE FRONT WL
TRIGGER SCT SHOWERS AND TSTMS. SINCE THE AIRMASS WL CONT TO
DESTABILIZE LATE THIS AFTN AS DEWPOINTS RISE TO NEAR 70 AND CAPES
APPROACH 1500 J/KG A FEW OF THESE STORMS MAY BE SEVERE WITH
DAMAGING WIND AND HAIL. LOOKS LIKE BEST COMBINATION OF TIMING AND
INGREDIENTS WL OCCUR ACRS NE AR EARLY THIS EVENING WHERE
INSTABILITY WL BE MODERATE AS THE FRONT PUSHES THROUGH. ACRS THE
REMAINDER OF THE AREA THE LOSS OF HEATING AS THE SUN SETS SHOULD
PRECLUDE ANY SEVERE WEATHER THOUGH A FEW STORMS MAY BE STRONG.

FILTERING IN BEHIND THE FRONT. TEMPS WL FALL INTO THE LOWER AND
MIDDLE 50S ACRS NRN SXNS BY THU MORNING. ON THURSDAY EXPECT STRONG
LOW LEVEL CAA THROUGHOUT THE DAY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE DUE TO A
VERY DRY AIRMASS. TEMPS WL BE ALMOST 20 DEGREES COLDER WITH
READINGS STRUGGLING TO REACH 70 IN SOME AREAS. A BRISK NORTHERLY
WIND WL HAVE A FALL FEEL TO IT.

THE COLDEST NIGHT OF THIS NEW FALL SEASON WL BE UPON US THURSDAY.
HIGH PRESSURE WL SETTLED ACRS THE REGION WITH CLEAR SKIES AND
DIMINISHING WINDS. EXPECT TEMPS DEEP INTO THE 40S...EXCEPT

ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY IN STORE FOR FRIDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE IN
CONTROL. TEMPS WL START TO WARM A LITTLE WITH READINGS MAINLY IN

FLOW DEVELOPS ALONG THE GULF COAST STATES ADVECTING SOME HIGHER

THAN THE PREVIOUS NIGHT.

THE UPPER LOW MOVES TO THE NW OF THE AREA SAT NIGHT THROUGH SUN DRAWING

SKIES WERE PARTLY CLOUDY OVER THE MIDSOUTH TODAY WITH MORE CLOUD 
COVER FARTHER WEST. A BROAD AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WAS IN CONTROL OF 
MOST OF THE NATION.

A STRONG SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL DIG INTO WESTERN MONTANA THIS 
EVENING. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM NORTHWESTERN 
MINNESOTA TO EASTERN COLORADO. ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE 
ADVECTED ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT...AS SEEN IN THE 850MB 
TRAJECTORIES. AS THE SHORTWAVE DIGS INTO CENTRAL ILLINOIS BY LATE 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...THE COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE 
NORTHWESTERN FORECAST AREA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LIKELY 
ACCOMPANY THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. THE BULK OF THE RAIN WILL OCCUR 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

THIS FRONT WILL BE MUCH COOLER AND FALL LIKE THAN THE RECORD 
BREAKING TEMPERATURES OF THE RECENT PAST. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT 
THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHEASTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA BY NOON THURSDAY...SO UNTIL THEN...A CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL 
EXIST. OTHERWISE...NORTHERLY WINDS AND COLD ADVECTION THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY THURSDAY WILL TAKE PLACE. MAX TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY WARM INTO 
THE 70S.  

THE MODELS DEPICT THE CURRENT LOW OVER THE NORTHERN GREAT BASIN TO 
GET CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW. THIS LOW WILL LINGER OVER THE DESERT 
SOUTHWEST BEFORE KICKING OUT INTO THE PLAINS ON FRIDAY. THERE IS 
SOME SPECULATION ON THE HANDLING OF THIS FEATURE. BY SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON...THE GFS PRODUCES AN UPPER HIGH OVER THE MIDSOUTH. AS 
TIME PROGRESSES...A WEAK EASTERLY TYPE WAVE IS GENERATED AND THE 
STEERING FLOW BRINGS THIS WAVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY. 
THE LATEST MEX DATA INDICATES A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR RAIN WITH THIS 
FEATURE. WILL NOT BITE ON THIS SOLUTION YET.

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH TODAY BEHIND THE COLD 
FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH THE CWA THIS EVENING. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 80S. SKIES WILL BECOME MOSTLY 
SUNNY BY THIS AFTERNOON AS THE STRATUS CURRENTLY AROUND THE AREA IS 
EXPECTED TO BURN OFF.

TONIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA. EXPECT CLEAR 
SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS ALLOWING FOR LOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE 
MID 50S TO MID 60S.

A COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO APPROACH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY. EXPECT 
PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR MOST OF THE DAY. BY 
AFTERNOON...NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL WILL BEGIN 
TO SEE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS THE FRONT MOVES INTO 
THE CWA. WILL ADD POPS TO THE FORECAST FOR THE NORTHWESTERN ZONES.

FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
WILL BUMP POPS FROM SLIGHT CHANCE TO 40/50 POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
MIDSOUTH. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL LINGER INTO THURSDAY ACROSS 
SOUTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN BEHIND THE FRONT BY THURSDAY NIGHT 
BRINGING EVEN COOLER AND MORE AUTUMN LIKE WEATHER TO THE MIDSOUTH. 
THE HIGH WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER THROUGH THE BEGINNING PART OF THE 
WEEKEND. EXPECT HIGHS IN THE 70S AND LOWS IN THE 40S AND 50S.

AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MAY BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA FOR THE END OF THE WEEKEND UNTIL THE END 
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. STILL EARLY TO KNOW EXACT MOVEMENT AND 
POSITION OF THE LOW...WILL KEEP SMALL POPS IN FORECAST.

.UPDATE...
RADAR INDICATES ISOLATED SHOWERS THAT MOVED INTO EAST-CENTRAL
AR AND SOUTHWEST TN ARE DISSIPATING WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.
PLAN TO UPDATE AND REMOVE RAIN CHANCES FROM THE FORECAST FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ASSOCIATED WITH THESE
SHOWERS WILL MOVE INTO NORTH MS AND COULD STILL SET OFF ONE OR TWO
SHOWERS...BUT THE PROBABILITY IS VERY SLIM AND NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO
MENTION IN THE FORECAST. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES LOWER
DEWPOINTS...IN THE 60S...SPREADING INTO NORTHERN AREAS OF THE
MIDSOUTH ALONG WITH A LITTLE INCREASE IN THE WIND SPEED FROM THE
NORTH AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA. THE HIGH WILL CONTINUE
TO BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH OVERNIGHT FROM THE NORTH. FORECAST LOWS
LOOK OK.

UPDATE ISSUED 452 PM CDT MON SEP 26 2005...

UPDATED FORECAST TO INCLUDE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
ACROSS NORTHEAST AR...THE MO BOOTHEEL...AND WEST TN NORTH OF MEMPHIS
THROUGH EARLY EVENING. AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE WITH THE MAIN
VORT MAX JUST NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH HAS KICKED OFF A FEW SHOWERS
ACROSS NORTHEAST AR INTO THE MO BOOTHEEL. ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS
POSSIBLE ACROSS NORTHWEST TN. THESE SHOWERS...AND POSSIBLE
THUNDERSTORMS AS LAPS SHOWS CAPES AROUND 800 J/KG...WILL MOVE
SOUTHEASTWARD. THINK THEY WILL DIMINISH WILL LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.
HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR IN CASE NEED TO ADD THE SLIGHT
CHANCE OF SHOWERS / THUNDERSTORMS TO ZONES FURTHER SOUTHWARD.

DISCUSSION ISSUED 300 PM CDT MON SEP 26 2005...

A COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED THROUGH THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. A FEW
SHOWERS ENTERED NORTHERN ARKANSAS EARLY THIS AFTERNOON BUT HAVE
DIMINISHED AS THEY PUSH FURTHER AWAY FROM THE UPPER JET AND DEEPER
MOISTURE NORTH OF THE REGION. AM CONCERNED ABOUT LOW STRATUS AND/OR
FOG DEVELOPMENT LATE TONIGHT CONSIDERING THE COLD AIR ADVECTING IN
TONIGHT WITH THE MOIST AIR THAT IS ALREADY IN PLACE. THE MAV/MET
GUIDANCE IS HINTING AT THIS SCENARIO DEVELOPING...AND BOTH INDICATE
THAT THE STRATUS MAY BE MORE NOTICEABLE NEAR AND WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS. 850 TEMPS ARE AROUND +17 WHICH SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO HIGHS IN
THE 80S. A STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL ARRIVE WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. THERE ARE QUESTIONS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF FORCING ALONG THE
FRONT OVER THE MIDSOUTH. A VORT MAX WILL BE OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS
WHICH WILL AID SUPPORT THERE WHILE THE JET STREAM WILL BE MOVING
NORTHEAST OF THE REGION. WILL CONTINUE LOW CHANCES FOR NOW BUT MAY
HAVE TO UP THEM IF LATER MODEL RUNS SHOW BETTER SUPPORT OVER THE
REGION.

GFS HAS HAD GOOD CONSISTENCY WITH THE COOLER AIR COMING INTO THE
REGION. NAM AND EUROPEAN RUNS ALSO SUPPORT THE COOLER AIR COMING
DOWN. 850 TEMPS FALL TO AROUND +12 ON THURSDAY WHICH DOES SUPPORT
HIGHS IN THE 70S. LOWS IN THE 50S ARE VERY LIKELY AS WELL AND SOME
OF THE COLD SPOTS MAY SEE LOWS IN THE 40S.

THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN IS SATURDAY NIGHT AND ONWARDS AS THE GFS
ADVERTISES A CLOSED LOW APPROACHING THE REGION FROM THE WEST.

SATELLITE SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW CLOUDS ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE
EXTENDING INTO NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. THESE ARE CLOUDS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE REMNANTS FROM HURRICANE RITA. RITA IS NOW AN ELONGATED
TROUGH THAT EXTENDS FROM OHIO THROUGH MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND INTO
WESTERN ALABAMA. THERE IS A COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDS FROM THE OHIO
RIVER VALLEY THROUGH THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS
AND DOWN INTO NORTHEAST TEXAS. THIS FRONT IS PROGRESSIVELY MOVING
INTO THE REGION AND SHOULD KICK THE REMNANTS OF RITA AWAY FROM THE
AREA. THE LOW CLOUDS WILL LIKELY MIX OUT THIS AFTERNOON RESULTING
IN PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. THE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO DROP
SOUTHWARD THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. RAIN CHANCES ARE LOW BECAUSE
FORCING ALONG THE FRONT IS WEAK THUS UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION IS

REMNANTS OF RITA ARE HASTENING NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY
AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT FROM CHICAGO TO OKLAHOMA CITY. WESTERN EDGE
OF RITAS CLD SHIELD IS NOW ROUGHLY ON THE WESTERN COUNTIES OF
THE MIDSOUTH CWA. EXPECT CU TO DEVELOP TODAY AHEAD OF THE FRONT
WHICH INDICATES THERE WILL BE ENOUGH SUNSHINE TO WARM INTO THE
MID TO UPPER 80S TODAY. WINDS WILL BECOME NORTHERLY ONCE THE
FRONT PASSES.

THE CENTER OF THE HIGH PUSHING THE FRONT THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH
WILL ACTUALLY MOVE EAST INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY TUESDAY
EVENING WHILE ANOTHER FRONT SLIPS SOUTHEASTWARD OUT OF CANADA TO
THE MIDWEST. A FEW SHOWERS MAY ACCOMPANY THE FRONT WEDNESDAY.

BOTH OF THE FRONTS WILL BRING COOLER WEATHER. SOME NORTHERN
MIDSOUTH COUNTIES COULD COOL DOWN INTO THE UPPER 40S BY WEDNESDAY
MORNING.

A SHORT WAVE TROUGH WORKING EAST THROUGH THE NORTHERN FLOW WILL
BRING MORE RAIN THIS WEEKEND.

MODELS INDICATE THE STORM MAY SLOW...AND IF THIS OCCURS RAINFALL
TOTALS MAY BE MUCH HIGHER THAN CURRENTLY INDICATED. STAY TUNED.

WEATHER CONDITIONS WILL BEGIN TO DETERIORATE ACROSS SOUTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. SEVERE
THREAT CONTINUING TO INCREASE OVER EAST-CENTRAL ARKANSAS AND NORTH
MISSISSIPPI...WITH FAVORABLE SHEAR PROFILES THAT WILL BE CONDUCIVE
TO TORNADO DEVELOPMENT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS EAST ARKANSAS AND
NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI. OUTER CONVECTIVE SPIRAL BANDS JUST SOUTHWEST
OF THE FORECAST AREA CONTAIN SEVERAL MINI-SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS
WITH RADAR INDICATED ROTATION. THESE SPIRAL BANDS AND INCREASINGLY
FAVORABLE SEVERE ENVIRONMENT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHWARD
THROUGH THE EVENING. THE BEST SEVERE WEATHER AND TORNADO THREAT WILL
REMAIN PRIMARILY SOUTH OF THE INTERSTATE 40 CORRIDOR THIS EVENING
AND TONIGHT. ALTHOUGH...SEVERE WEATHER CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED
OUT FARTHER NORTH AS THE CONVECTIVE BANDS ROTATE NORTHWESTWARD. LOSS
OF DAYTIME HEATING LATER TONIGHT MAY LESSON THE OVERALL SEVERE
THREAT...BUT WITH CONTINUED INCREASING LOW LEVEL SHEAR VALUES AND
WINDS...THERE WILL STILL BE SOME LEVEL OF SEVERE THREAT THROUGH THE
NIGHT.

RITA WILL CONTINUE TO THE NORTH AND THEN MORE NORTHEASTERLY ON
SUNDAY...AS WELL AS SLOW ITS FORWARD SPEED AS THE STEERING FLOW
WEAKENS SOMEWHAT. LOW LEVEL SHEAR PROFILES ACROSS THE ENTIRE MID-
SOUTH WILL BE STRONG ON SUNDAY...AND THERE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE A
SEVERE WEATHER AND TORNADO THREAT OVERSPREADING THE AREA. BY SUNDAY
NIGHT...RITA SHOULD HAVE WEAKENED SUFFICIENTLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT A
SEVERE WEATHER THREAT CONTINUING BEYOND SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT THEN AS
SOME OF THE GLOBAL AND TROPICAL MODELS INDICATE A SLOWING OF THE
SYSTEM AS IT MOVES CLOSER TO OUR AREA. AS THIS OCCURS...THE THREAT
FOR FLOODING WILL INCREASE. AT THIS POINT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL
FOR HEAVY RAIN AND POSSIBLE FLOODING...BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH
ENOUGH REGARDING THE SPEED AND TIMING OF THE REMNANT LOW TO ISSUE A
FLOOD WATCH AT THIS TIME. AT SOME POINT...A FLOOD WATCH MAY BECOME
NECESSARY AND WILL BRIEF NEXT SHIFT ON THIS POSSIBILITY. ALSO PLAN
TO HIGHLIGHT THE FLOOD THREAT AS WELL AS THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT
IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.

RITA SHOULD FINALLY CLEAR EAST OF THE AREA BY MID-WEEK BRINGING AN
END TO THE LIKELY RAIN CHANCES. THERE MAY STILL BE SMALL CHANCES OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...AS A
STRONGER NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH PUSHES A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE

HAVE DECIDED TO ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH THAT WILL BE IN EFFECT FROM 6 AM
CDT SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH 5 AM CDT MONDAY MORNING. THIS IS IN
ANTICIPATION OF HEAVY RAINFALL SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. AT THIS
POINT...IT APPEARS LIKELY THAT RAINFALL TOTALS BETWEEN 3 AND 6
INCHES...WITH ISOLATED HIGHER AMOUNTS...WILL OCCUR. SOME COMPUTER
MODELS INDICATE THE STORM MAY SLOW...AND IF THIS OCCURS RAINFALL
TOTALS MAY BE MUCH HIGHER THAN CURRENTLY INDICATED. STAY TUNED.

TORNADO WATCHES 815 AND 816 CONTINUE FOR PORTIONS OF THE AREA
THROUGH 9 PM CDT TONIGHT.


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 337 PM...

WEATHER CONDITIONS WILL BEGIN TO DETERIORATE ACROSS SOUTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. SEVERE
THREAT CONTINUING TO INCREASE OVER EAST-CENTRAL ARKANSAS AND NORTH
MISSISSIPPI...WITH FAVORABLE SHEAR PROFILES THAT WILL BE CONDUCIVE
TO TORNADO DEVELOPMENT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS EAST ARKANSAS AND
NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI. OUTER CONVECTIVE SPIRAL BANDS JUST SOUTHWEST
OF THE FORECAST AREA CONTAIN SEVERAL MINI-SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS
WITH RADAR INDICATED ROTATION. THESE SPIRAL BANDS AND INCREASINGLY
FAVORABLE SEVERE ENVIRONMENT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHWARD
THROUGH THE EVENING. THE BEST SEVERE WEATHER AND TORNADO THREAT WILL
REMAIN PRIMARILY SOUTH OF THE INTERSTATE 40 CORRIDOR THIS EVENING
AND TONIGHT. ALTHOUGH...SEVERE WEATHER CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED
OUT FARTHER NORTH AS THE CONVECTIVE BANDS ROTATE NORTHWESTWARD. LOSS
OF DAYTIME HEATING LATER TONIGHT MAY LESSON THE OVERALL SEVERE
THREAT...BUT WITH CONTINUED INCREASING LOW LEVEL SHEAR VALUES AND
WINDS...THERE WILL STILL BE SOME LEVEL OF SEVERE THREAT THROUGH THE
NIGHT.

RITA WILL CONTINUE TO THE NORTH AND THEN MORE NORTHEASTERLY ON
SUNDAY...AS WELL AS SLOW ITS FORWARD SPEED AS THE STEERING FLOW
WEAKENS SOMEWHAT. LOW LEVEL SHEAR PROFILES ACROSS THE ENTIRE MID-
SOUTH WILL BE STRONG ON SUNDAY...AND THERE WILL ONCE AGAIN BE A
SEVERE WEATHER AND TORNADO THREAT OVERSPREADING THE AREA. BY SUNDAY
NIGHT...RITA SHOULD HAVE WEAKENED SUFFICIENTLY ENOUGH TO PREVENT A
SEVERE WEATHER THREAT CONTINUING BEYOND SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT THEN AS
SOME OF THE GLOBAL AND TROPICAL MODELS INDICATE A SLOWING OF THE
SYSTEM AS IT MOVES CLOSER TO OUR AREA. AS THIS OCCURS...THE THREAT
FOR FLOODING WILL INCREASE. AT THIS POINT THERE IS THE POTENTIAL

.DISCUSSION...

THE BIG STORY THIS MORNING WILL BE IMPACTS FROM THE REMNANTS OF
HURRICANE RITA...CURRENTLY MOVING NORTH ACROSS EXTREME EAST TEXAS
THIS MORNING. LATEST NHC TRACK GUIDANCE NOW HAS SHIFTED THE
EVENTUAL TRACK OF RITA FURTHER NORTH AND EAST...WHICH IF OCCURS
WOULD MEAN POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IMPACTS ACROSS PORTIONS OF
THE MID-SOUTH. THE FIRST THINGS TO DEAL WITH IN THE FIRST PERIOD
IS RAIN AND THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL AND SEVERE WEATHER THREATS. AT
THIS POINT...IT APPEARS THAT THE TIMING OF THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST
OUTER BANDS HAS SLOWED A BIT. CLOSEST OUTER BANDS AND THUNDERSTORMS
IN ASSOCIATION WITH RITA ARE NOW APPROACHING INTERSTATE 20 IN SOUTH-
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. THEREFORE...HAVE DECIDED TO TRIM POPS BACK A
BIT ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA.

THE ENVIRONMENT TO OUR SOUTH IS BECOMING FAVORABLE FOR SEVERE
WEATHER AND TORNADOES. THE SOUNDINGS TO OUR SOUTH ARE INDICATING A
STRONGLY SHEARED AND INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT. THE LOW LEVEL
WIND PROFILE NOTED FROM THE 12Z JAN SOUNDING SHOWS INCREASING LOW
LEVEL VEERING AND STRONG LOW LEVEL WIND FIELDS...40-60 KTS BETWEEN
3000 FT. AND 5000 FT. THIS ENVIRONMENT APPEARS FAVORABLE FOR TORNADO
DEVELOPMENT AND WITH RITA CONTINUING TO MOVE NORTH...IT APPEARS THAT
THIS ENVIRONMENT WILL EVENTUALLY ADVECT NORTH AS RITA CONTINUES
NORTHWARD. WITH THIS IN MIND...CURRENTLY ANTICIPATING THE SEVERE
WEATHER AND TORNADO THREAT TO MOVE NORTH INTO PORTIONS OF NORTH
MISSISSIPPI AND EAST-CENTRAL ARKANSAS LATER THIS EVENING. HAVE
UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO INCLUDE A SLIGHT RISK FOR
SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA...AND WILL
CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS THREAT THROUGH THE DAY. THE SEVERE THREAT
MAY MOVE A BIT FURTHER NORTHWARD TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...BUT WILL HAVE
MUCH MORE DETAILS LATER TODAY. ALSO...CURRENT FORECAST TRACK MAY
BRING A HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING THREAT OVER THE COMING DAYS...AND
WILL UPDATE AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE LATER TODAY TO REFLECT THESE
POSSIBILITIES.

UPDATED ZONES AND FORECAST OUT SHORTLY. STAYED TUNED FOR UPDATES ON
POTENTIAL HAZARDS THROUGH THE DAY AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

305 PM CDT FRI SEP 23 2005

.DISCUSSION...

A RATHER DIFFICULT FORECAST TODAY WITH PREDICTING THE EVENTUAL
IMPACTS FROM HURRICANE RITA ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA. THE PRIMARY
CONCERNS WILL BE THE OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN THAT WILL EVENTUALLY
DETERMINE THE FUTURE PATH OF RITA AND HER POTENTIAL IMPACTS ON THE
MID-SOUTH.

IN THE SHORT-TERM...WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ALONG WITH A
WEAKENING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL PERSIST OVER THE REGION FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON AS THE UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO BREAK
DOWN AND MOVE EAST. THIS WEAKENING OF THE UPPER RIDGE HAS ALLOWED
HURRICANE RITA TO MOVE IN A MORE NORTHWARD DIRECTION TODAY AND RITA
SHOULD CONTINUE TO APPROACH THE GULF COAST WITH A LANDFALL IN THE
VICINITY OF THE TEXAS/LOUISIANA STATE LINE. OF COURSE AS IS NORMAL
WITH ANY TROPICAL SYSTEM...A WOBBLE TO THE EAST OR WEST BEFORE
LANDFALL COULD ALTER THE ULTIMATE LANDFALL POINT. AS FOR WHICH
DIRECTION RITA MOVES AFTER LANDFALL IS THE BIG QUESTION THAT WILL
IMPACT WEATHER CONDITIONS ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH THIS WEEKEND.

AT THIS POINT AND WITH SOMEWHAT LOWER CONFIDENCE THAN USUAL...IT
APPEARS THAT THE EVENTUAL TRACK OF RITA WILL DEPEND ON THE OVERALL
EVOLUTION OF THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN OVER THE UNITED STATES. IN
PARTICULAR...THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE THE EVOLUTION OF THE WESTERN
TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND ITS EFFECTS ON THE
UPPER RIDGE CURRENTLY BREAKING DOWN OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. AFTER
MUCH ANALYSIS OF THE 12Z UPPER LEVEL RAOB DATA...IT APPEARS THAT THE
12Z GFS RUN HAS A DECENT HANDLE ON THE OVERALL UPPER PATTERN AND ALSO
THE SURFACE TRACK OF THE HURRICANE...AT LEAST IN THE SHORT-TERM...
LOOKS GOOD. THE 12Z GFS MODEL RUN SHOWS THE UPPER TROUGH MOVING EAST
AND FILLING AS A STRONG UPPER JET STREAK EJECTS OUT OF THE BASE OF
THE TROUGH ACROSS THE CENTRAL ROCKIES. THIS WOULD LEAD TO A LESS
AMPLIFIED TROUGH OVER THE WEST...AND A MUCH FLATTER UPPER RIDGE.
THIS WOULD LEAVE WEAK SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT OVER MUCH OF THE
SOUTHERN U.S. AND WOULD TEND TO ALLOW THE REMNANTS OF RITA TO MOVE
NORTHWARD ALONG THE WESTERN LOUISIANA/EASTERN TEXAS AREA THAN
SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHEAST IN THE WEAK SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT.

IF THIS OCCURS...PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH...ESPECIALLY SOUTHWESTERN
AREAS WILL HAVE A FLOOD POTENTIAL AS WELL AS A SEVERE WEATHER
(TORNADO) POTENTIAL. OTHER MODELS HANDLE THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN A BIT
DIFFERENTLY AND STALL THE REMNANT LOW FURTHER TO OUR WEST...WHICH
WOULD LESSON THE FLOODING RAIN/SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL. AT THIS
POINT HAVE FAVORED THE GFS MODEL... BUT DUE TO LOWER THAN AVERAGE
CONFIDENCE...PREFER TO JUST KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING STARTING SATURDAY
AREAWIDE...WITH BEST CHANCES SOUTH AND LESSER CHANCES NORTH. THEN FOR
SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...KEEP LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS
AREAWIDE AND MENTION IN THE HWO THE SEVERE/FLASH FLOOD
POSSIBILITIES AND REFLECT THAT THINGS COULD CHANGE BASED UPON THE
EVENTUAL TRACK.

AS FOR THE EXTENDED FORECAST...MADE FEW CHANGES WITH THE BIG STORY
IN THE EXTENDED BEING THE PASSAGE OF A STRONG COLD FRONT WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. EXPECT COOLER AND LESS HUMID CONDITIONS BEHIND THIS FRONT.

A BROAD WEAKENING UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ALONG WITH WEAK
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS
MORNING. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY HAS STALLED TO OUR NORTH ACROSS
SOUTHERN ILLINOIS...SOUTHERN MISSOURI...AND INTO OKLAHOMA. THE
BOUNDARY SHOULD NOT MOVE MUCH THROUGH THE DAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT IS ALIGNED ALONG THE FRONT. IN ADDITION...
WEAK SHORTWAVES ARE MOVING THROUGH THE FLOW AND HAVE HELPED TRIGGER
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE BOUNDARY. WITH THE UPPER FLOW
IN PLACE...CURRENTLY THINK THAT MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY
WILL REMAIN NORTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA...BUT WILL KEEP AN EYE ON
THIS THROUGH THE DAY. EXPECT CLOUD COVER TO MOVE MORE SLOWLY INTO
THE AREA FROM THE SOUTH THAN EARLIER EXPECTED IN ASSOCIATION WITH
HURRICANE RITA. STILL LOOKING AT THIN HIGH CIRRUS CLOUDS
OVERSPREADING THE AREA...BUT SHOULD BE THIN ENOUGH TO ALLOW DECENT
DAYTIME HEATING TO CONTINUE. HAVE MADE THE APPROPRIATE UPDATES TO
THE CLOUD GRIDS. ALSO WILL ADJUST TEMPERATURES UP A FEW DEGREES TO
OVER SOUTHERN AREAS TO REFLECT INCREASED DAYTIME HEATING. SO EXPECT
PRIMARILY ANOTHER UNSEASONABLY WARM AND DRY DAY.

HURRICANE RITA STILL ON TRACK TO MAKE LANDFALL ALONG THE UPPER TEXAS
TO SOUTHWEST LOUISIANA COASTLINE. THE HURRICANE IS STILL GOING
THROUGH INTERNAL PROCESSES...OR EYEWALL REPLACEMENT CYCLES...SO
THERE MAY BE CONTINUED FLUCTUATIONS IN INTENSITY. IT APPEARS AT
THIS POINT THAT OUTER BANDS ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE STORM WILL
BEGIN IMPACTING THE AREA DURING THE DAY SATURDAY AS THE SYSTEM
MOVES SLOWLY NORTH...BUT WILL HAVE MUCH MORE INFORMATION ON THIS
SYSTEM LATER TODAY. STAY TUNED.

A RAIN BAND FROM RITA COULD IMPACT THE SOUTHERN MIDSOUTH TONIGHT.
RITA SHOULD MAKE LANDFALL EARLY SATURDAY MORNING AND MOVE NORTH

A FEW HIGH CLOUDS FROM RITAS OUTFLOW ALREADY SKIMMING THE SE CORNER 
OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING WITH THE NORTHERNMOST RAINBAND 
DISSIPATING ACRS S CNTRL MS/AL. THE FIRST NIGHT OF THE OFFICIAL FALL 
SEASON WILL BE QUITE WARM WITH LOWS FROM THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 
70S...ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. ONGOING 
FORECAST LOOKS FINE WITH NO UPDATE PLANNED. 

SJM

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 321 PM...
UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPERATURES CONTINUE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH THIS 
AFTERNOON...AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO RIDGE DOWN OVER 
THE REGION AND A WEAKENING UPPER RIDGE EXTENDS OVER THE AREA. EXPECT 
PLEASANT BUT WARM AND UNSEASONABLY HUMID WEATHER TO CONTINUE THROUGH 
TONIGHT...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.

THE UPPER RIDGE OVERHEAD TODAY SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AND MOVE
EAST AS AN UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO DIG ACROSS THE WESTERN STATES.
AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE RIDING OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE ON
FRIDAY WILL INTERACT WITH A SURFACE COLD FRONT THAT WILL BE MOVING
SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS...SOUTH-CENTRAL MISSOURI...AND
NORTHERN OKLAHOMA...TO PRODUCE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO OUR NORTH.
HAVE DECIDED TO ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO OUR NORTHERN BORDER TO
ACCOUNT FOR ANY CONVECTIVELY PRODUCED OUTFLOW BOUNDARY THAT MAY MOVE
INTO THESE AREAS FROM CONVECTION GENERATED TO THE NORTH. ACROSS THE
REMAINDER OF THE AREA...EXPECT HIGH PRESSURE TO HOLD ON AND PROVIDE
MORE UNSEASONABLY HOT...HUMID...AND DRY WEATHER.

THE NEXT BIG WEATHER STORY FOR THE WEEKEND AND FIRST PART OF NEXT
WEEK WILL BE THE EVENTUAL TRACK OF HURRICANE RITA. THE FORECAST
GUIDANCE...INCLUDING THE GFS AND MOST OF THE TROPICAL MODEL SUITE
HAS SHIFTED THE FORECAST TRACK A BIT MORE TO THE EAST AS COMPARED TO
YESTERDAYS RUNS. THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST TRACK LANDFALLS THE
HURRICANE ON SATURDAY MORNING AS A CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE ALONG THE
EXTREME NORTHEAST TEXAS COAST. WITH THE UPPER RIDGE GRADUALLY
BREAKING DOWN THIS TRACK APPEARS REASONABLE. THE REMNANT SYSTEM
WEAKENS AND SLOWLY MOVES NORTH...BEFORE POSSIBLY STALLING IN THE
VICINITY OF THE ARKLATEX REGION THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEKEND AND
EARLY NEXT WEEK. SINCE WE ARE STILL AT LEAST A DAY AND A HALF FROM
LANDFALL THERE STILL MAY BE SOME CHANGES IN THE TRACK. ANY CHANGES IN
PROJECTED TRACK WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE TYPE OF WEATHER THAT WE
SEE ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA.

AT THIS POINT...IT APPEARS THAT THE MID-SOUTH WILL REMAIN TO THE EAST
OF THE TRACK OF RITA. WITH THIS TYPE OF TRACK...THE MID-SOUTH CAN
ANTICIPATE THAT OUTER RAINBANDS ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF RITA WILL
ROTATE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE AREA BEGINNING LATE FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH
AT LEAST SUNDAY. THERE MAY ALSO BE SOME SEVERE WEATHER (TORNADO)
THREAT ASSOCIATED WITH THE OUTER RAINBANDS...BUT THIS WILL NOT BE
RESOLVED UNTIL WE GET CLOSER TO THE EVENT. ANY CHANGES IN THE TRACK
AND STRENGTH WILL CHANGE THE WEATHER IMPACTS EXPECTED ACROSS OUR
AREA. STAY TUNED.

BY MID-WEEK...RITA WILL HAVE DISSIPATED TO A REMNANT LOW SOMEWHERE
OVER THE SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THE UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME
MORE PROGRESSIVE AND AMPLIFIED. BEFORE THAN...PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY SHOULD HANG AROUND TO PRODUCE SCATTERED TO
ISOLATED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE BEGINNING OF

UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPERATURES CONTINUE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH THIS
AFTERNOON...AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO RIDGE DOWN OVER
THE REGION AND A WEAKENING UPPER RIDGE EXTENDS OVER THE AREA.
EXPECT PLEASANT BUT WARM AND UNSEASONABLY HUMID WEATHER TO CONTINUE
THROUGH TONIGHT...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.

THE UPPER RIDGE OVERHEAD TODAY SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AND MOVE
EAST AS AN UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO DIG ACROSS THE WESTERN STATES.
AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE RIDING OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE ON
FRIDAY WILL INTERACT WITH A SURFACE COLD FRONT THAT WILL BE MOVING
SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS...SOUTH-CENTRAL MISSOURI...AND
NORTHERN OKLAHOMA...TO PRODUCE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO OUR NORTH.
HAVE DECIDED TO ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO OUR NORTHERN BORDER TO
ACCOUNT FOR ANY CONVECTIVELY PRODUCED OUTFLOW BOUNDARY THAT MAY MOVE
INTO THESE AREAS FROM CONVECTION GENERATED TO THE NORTH. ACROSS THE
REMAINDER OF THE AREA...EXPECT HIGH PRESSURE TO HOLD ON AND PROVIDE
MORE UNSEASONABLY HOT...HUMID...AND DRY WEATHER.

THE NEXT BIG WEATHER STORY FOR THE WEEKEND AND FIRST PART OF NEXT
WEEK WILL BE THE EVENTUAL TRACK OF HURRICANE RITA. THE FORECAST
GUIDANCE...INCLUDING THE GFS AND MOST OF THE TROPICAL MODEL SUITE
HAS SHIFTED THE FORECAST TRACK A BIT MORE TO THE EAST AS COMPARED TO
YESTERDAYS RUNS. THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST TRACK LANDFALLS THE
HURRICANE ON SATURDAY MORNING AS A CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE ALONG THE
EXTREME NORTHEAST TEXAS COAST. WITH THE UPPER RIDGE GRADUALLY
BREAKING DOWN THIS TRACK APPEARS REASONABLE. THE REMNANT SYSTEM
WEAKENS AND SLOWLY MOVES NORTH...BEFORE POSSIBLY STALLING IN THE
VICINITY OF THE ARKLATEX REGION THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEKEND AND
EARLY NEXT WEEK. SINCE WE ARE STILL AT LEAST A DAY AND A HALF FROM
LANDFALL THERE STILL MAY BE SOME CHANGES IN THE TRACK. ANY CHANGES IN
PROJECTED TRACK WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON THE TYPE OF WEATHER THAT WE
SEE ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA.

AT THIS POINT...IT APPEARS THAT THE MID-SOUTH WILL REMAIN TO THE EAST
OF THE TRACK OF RITA. WITH THIS TYPE OF TRACK...THE MID-SOUTH CAN
ANTICIPATE THAT OUTER RAINBANDS ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF RITA WILL
ROTATE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE AREA BEGINNING LATE FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH
AT LEAST SUNDAY. THERE MAY ALSO BE SOME SEVERE WEATHER (TORNADO)
THREAT ASSOCIATED WITH THE OUTER RAINBANDS...BUT THIS WILL NOT BE
RESOLVED UNTIL WE GET CLOSER TO THE EVENT. ANY CHANGES IN THE TRACK
AND STRENGTH WILL CHANGE THE WEATHER IMPACTS EXPECTED ACROSS OUR
AREA. STAY TUNED.

BY MID-WEEK...RITA WILL HAVE DISSIPATED TO A REMNANT LOW SOMEWHERE
OVER THE SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THE UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME
MORE PROGRESSIVE AND AMPLIFIED. BEFORE THAN...PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY SHOULD HANG AROUND TO PRODUCE SCATTERED TO
ISOLATED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE BEGINNING OF
NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER TROUGH WILL HELP SEND A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE
AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...WITH ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. COOLER AND DRYER WEATHER SHOULD FOLLOW THE

SURFACE OBS INDICATING A FEW AREAS OF FOG WITH VISIBILITIES OF 3/4SM

PATCHY DENSE FOG ACCORDINGLY. FOG NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO WARRANT 
ADVISORY.

.DISCUSSION...

HOT WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE REGION TODAY. AN ELONGATED  
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE THAT EXTENDS FROM TEXAS THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH 
AND INTO THE SOUTHEAST U.S. IS THE ONLY WEATHER FEATURE AFFECTING 
THE MIDSOUTH REGION. THERE IS A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE PLAINS REGION 
THAT IS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE IT INTO THE REGION DUE TO THE STRENGTH 
OF THE RIDGE OVER THE AREA. RECORD HIGHS VERY POSSIBLE OVER MEMPHIS 
AND JACKSON TODAY AS 850 TEMP ARE AROUND THE +20 MARK. BELOW ARE 
RECORDS FOR TODAY AND TOMORROW. FAVOR THE WARMER FWC NUMBERS EXCEPT 
AT TUPELO WHICH LOOKS A TAD TOO COOL. THE FWC HAD DONE WELL IN THIS 
AIR MASS EXCEPT FOR YESTERDAY WHERE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS KEPT 
TEMPS DOWN A BIT. OTHERWISE...SHOULD START OFF VERY SUNNY WITH SOME 
DIURNAL CU POSSIBLE. THERE SHOULD NOT BE ANY STORMS AROUND TODAY. 
THE SHORTWAVE THAT FIRED STORMS YESTERDAY HAS WEAKENED AND MOVED 
AWAY FROM THE REGION. 

THE BIG QUESTION FOR THE MID SOUTH IS WHAT IMPACT WILL HURRICANE 
RITA HAVE ON THE REGIONS WEATHER. THE 00Z GFS CAME IN WITH A 
LANDFALL MORE EASTERLY THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS (NORTH OF GALVESTON 
BAY). MEANWHILE THE 00Z NAM HAS LANDFALL CLOSER TO WHERE THE GFS WAS 
YESTERDAY MORNING...SOUTH OF GALVESTON BAY. THE DRASTIC TURN IN THE 
GFS IS LIKELY DUE TO THE WEAKNESS DEVELOPING FASTER IN THE RIDGE 
THAN PREVIOUS RUNS HAD SUGGESTED. RECENT SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A 
TURN TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST WHICH WOULD SUPPORT MORE THE 00Z GFS. IN 
THE GFS SOLUTION...THE MIDSOUTH WOULD RECEIVE MORE RAINFALL AND THE 
RAIN WOULD BE MOVING UP FROM THE SOUTH SOONER THAN CURRENT FORECAST 
(BY SATURDAY 12Z). MEANWHILE...IF THE NAM VERIFIES THEN THE ONGOING 
FORECAST IS NOT BAD AT ALL. THERE WILL LIKELY BE RAIN AROUND MUCH OF 
THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND FEEL THAT MOST PLACES WILL AT LEAST 
SEE SOME RAIN. NOT READY TO FORECAST LIKELY CHANCES IN ANY ONE TIME 
PERIOD YET...WOULD PREFER TO SEE SOME MORE CONTINUITY IN THE MODEL 
RUNS. UPPER LEVEL CIRRUS MAY BEGIN TO AFFECT THE REGION AS EARLY AS 
TOMORROW WHICH IS WHY TEMPS ARE FORECASTED TO BE COOLER.

THE TRENDS IN THE MODELS IS NOT A GOOD ONE FOR EAST TEXAS. THIS 
TREND IS THAT THE HURRICANE WILL NOT BE PICKED UP BY THE SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH AND CARRIED AWAY IN THE WESTERLIES. INSTEAD...THE MODELS HAVE 
THE RIDGE OVER OKLAHOMA HOLDING STRONG AND THE HURRICANE MORE OR 
LESS BECOMING STALLED OVER THE REGION. THIS WOULD MEAN A LOT OF RAIN 
TO SAY THE LEAST FOR THAT AREA. SINCE THE UPPER FLOW WILL BE OUT OF 
THE SOUTHWEST...EXPECT THAT THE MIDSOUTH WILL SEE PERIODS OF RAIN 
FROM THAT SYSTEM THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK AT 
LEAST. THE GFS BRINGS DOWN A COOL FRONT MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT 
WHICH MAY DRY OUT OUR REGION FOR A DAY. IF THIS DOES NOT PAN 
OUT...COULD BE LOOKING AT A RAINY STRETCH OF DAYS. HAZARD POTENTIAL 
FOR THE MIDSOUTH IS STILL NOT TOTALLY KNOWN DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN 
WHERE LANDFALL WILL OCCUR AND WHAT WILL EXACTLY HAPPEN WITH THE 
SYSTEM ONCE IT MOVES INLAND. SIGNIFICANT WINDS ARE LOOKING MORE 
UNLIKELY BECAUSE THE SYSTEM WILL LIKELY NEVER GET CLOSE ENOUGH TO 
THE REGION FOR THAT TO BE A FACTOR. AM SLIGHTLY CONCERNED ABOUT 
ISOLATED TORNADOS WITH THESE RAIN BANDS BUT THE REGION MAY BE TOO 
FAR AWAY FROM THE BETTER SHEAR FOR THIS TO BE A PROBLEM. AM REAL 
UNCERTAIN ABOUT THE FLOOD THREAT. IT HAS BEEN RATHER DRY AND THE 
GROUND COULD SUPPORT A LOT OF RAIN OVER A LONG PERIOD OF TIME. ONCE 
AGAIN...THE REGION MAY BE TOO FAR AWAY FROM THE HEAVIER RAIN FOR 
FLASH FLOODING TO OCCUR. ALL OF THIS IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE...AND 
EVERYONE SHOULD STILL STAY ALERT TO THE LATEST FORECASTS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT)
VERY WEAK SHORTWAVE HAS TRIGGERED ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FOR MUCH OF 
THE DAY. IT APPEARS THAT THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WEAK BOUNDARIES OVER 
OUR CWA. ONE RUNS FROM KENNETT MISSOURI TO NEAR SAVANNAH...WITH A 
CUMULUS FIELD TO THE NORTHEAST OF IT. ANOTHER ACROSS NORTH 
MISSISSIPPI.

AIRMASS CAN STILL SUPPORT ISOLATED CONVECTION...BUT FEEL IF IT IS 
GOING TO DEVELOP...IT WILL BE IN THE NEXT 60 TO 90 MINUTES. 
CURRENTLY THINKING ISOLATED CONVECTION ACROSS MAINLY NORTH 
MISSISSIPPI...AND NORTHEAST OF BOUNDARY ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE.

WILL RAISE TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES TONIGHT...BASED ON READINGS 
THIS MORNING.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)
PRETTY GOOD BAROCLINICITY ACROSS THE US/CANADIAN BOARDER.  AT SOME 
POINT THAT ENERGY HAS GOT TO BUCKLE...BUT MODELS (ECMWF/GFS/UKMET) 
INDICATING THAT THE TROF WILL DROP ACROSS THE WESTERN US THROUGH THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. STRONG H5 RIDGE ACROSS THE CENTRAL US WILL SLOWLY 
MOVE INTO THE SOUTHEAST US AS HURRICANE RITA MOVES INLAND.

FORECAST CHALLENGE IS WHETHER OR NOT THE REMNANTS OF RITA MOVE INTO 
OUR SERVICE AREA. DIFFICULT TO SAY SINCE DECENT SFC HIGH MOVES INTO 
GREAT LAKES REGION AND UPPER TROF DEVELOPS ACROSS THE ROCKYS.  
MODELS INDICATE THAT A BULK OF THE TROPICAL MOISTURE MAY INDEED 
REMAIN TO OUR WEST BEFORE FINALLY BEING SCOPED UP BY A TROF ON DAY 
7. FOR NOW HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH OF THE FORECAST. LEFT SOME 
CONSERVATIVE POPS IN THE FORECAST AS WE REMAIN IN EAST TO SOUTHEAST 
SFC FLOW THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD.

UNDER THE STRONG H5 RIDGE WE SHOULD CONTINUE TO SEE NEAR RECORD HIGH 
TEMPS THROUGH FRIDAY BEFORE HIGH CLOUDS...POSSIBLE CONVECTION...AND 
LOWER HEIGHTS ALOFT HELP DROP HIGH TEMPS BACK INTO THE 80S.

330 AM CDT WED SEP 21 2005

.DISCUSSION...

A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS EAST/WEST ACROSS THE REGION. 
POSITIONING THE FRONT IS DIFFICULT DUE TO LACK OF OBSERVATIONS DUE 
TO AN UPGRADE AT THE FAA. AT 04Z IT WAS NEAR THE TN/MS BORDER. 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS PERSIST AS OF 08Z. FUELING THESE STORMS IS 
INSTABILITY OF AROUND 1000 J/KG AND AN UPPER VORT MAX THAT IS OVER 
THE REGION.

BOTH GFS/NAM HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE UPPER VORT. THIS VORT IS NOT 
EXPECTED TO MOVE MUCH AND WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION MUCH OF TODAY. 
THE MODELS DO NOT SHOW MUCH IN THE WAY OF RAIN CHANCES. THIS IS 
LIKELY DUE TO THE LACK OF DEEP MOISTURE. WITH THE UPPER VORT IN THE 
VICINITY ALONG WITH THE WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY AND VERY GOOD 
INSTABILITY EXPECTED (CAPE > 3000 J/KG AND LI -5) FEEL THAT ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE AROUND ALTHOUGH THE AREAL COVERAGE 
WILL BE LOW DUE TO THE LACK OF DEEP LEVEL MOISTURE. UNUSUALLY HOT 
WEATHER WILL PERSIST INTO THE WEEKEND AS THE UPPER RIDGE CENTERED 
OVER TEXAS WILL DICTATE THE WEATHER. RECORD HEAT WILL ONCE AGAIN BE 
POSSIBLE. SEE TABLE BELOW FOR RECORDS OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS.

THE NAM BRINGS A COLD FRONT DOWN INTO THE REGION LATE FRIDAY. IT 
ALSO MAINTAINS THE POSITION OF THE UPPER RIDGE OVER TEXAS AND STEERS 
HURRICANE RITA INTO THE SOUTHERN TIP OF TEXAS. SINCE THE NAM IS 
TRADITIONALLY NOT VERY GOOD IN HANDLING HURRICANE TRACKS OUT PAST 
THREE DAYS...WILL SIDE WITH THE GFS WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH MOST 
OTHER SOLUTIONS. THIS BRINGS RITA INTO THE NORTHWEST GULF COAST AND 
SLIDES THE CENTER OF THE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE MIDSOUTH AND INTO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN US. WITH THIS SOLUTION...THIS SHOULD KEEP THE FRONT 
NORTH OF THE REGION. THE FORECAST WILL CONTINUE TO BE HOT AND DRY 
FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. ON SATURDAY THE GFS BEGINS TO BRING THE 
FIRST ROUND OF PRECIPITATION FROM RITA INTO THE REGION. NOT SURE HOW 
LIKELY THIS IS SINCE THE GFS IS BREAKING OFF A DESCENT SIZE VORT MAX 
FROM THE STORM AND BRINGING IT UP. THIS IS DIFFERENT FROM YESTERDAYS 
RUN. IN EITHER CASE...SHOULD DEFINITELY BE GETTING A GOOD DEAL OF 
MID AND HIGH CLOUDS WHICH SHOULD LOWER TEMPS. 

THE EXTENDED FORECAST HAS MANY QUESTIONS STILL. THE MODELS ARE 
INCONSISTENT IN THEIR HANDLING OF THE HURRICANE ONCE IT MAKES 
LANDFALL. THE LATEST GFS STALLS IT OUT OVER SOUTHEAST TEXAS WHILE 
OTHER MODELS LIFT IT NORTHWARD TO BE CAUGHT IN THE WESTERLIES. STILL 
SHOULD RESULT IN RAIN CHANCES IN EITHER CASE. THE QUESTION BECOMES 
WHEN TO REMOVE RAIN CHANCES AND JUST HOW MUCH RAIN THE MIDSOUTH WILL 
SEE.

.DISCUSSION...

CURRENT FORECAST IS ON TRACK AND DO NOT SEE ANY REASON FOR AN UPDATE
ATTM. UPPER SHORT WAVE EXTENDS FROM OH THROUGH KY...AND IS MOVING
SOUTHEASTWARD. STRONG UPPER LEVEL HIGH IS CENTERED OVER TX WITH THE
MIDSOUTH IN NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
INDICATES DRY AIR AT THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS SPREADING INTO THE
MIDSOUTH. A VERY WEAK COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL IL THROUGH
SOUTH-CENTRAL MO WITH AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ACROSS SOUTHERN MO. THIS
FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTHEASTWARD...BUT IT WILL BECOME VERY
DIFFUSED. 12Z LZK SOUNDING INDICATES AFTERNOON CAPES AT OR ABOVE
3000 J/KG FOR THE MIDSOUTH. THUS THERE WILL BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY
FOR ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT.
AFTERNOON HIGHS WILL CONTINUE TO BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL...IN THE MID
90S. CURRENT FORECAST HAS ALL OF THIS COVERED WELL.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 301 AM CDT TUE SEP 20 2005

07Z SURFACE MAP SHOWS THE COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM ROUGHLY CHICAGO
THROUGH ST.LOUIS AND INTO OKLAHOMA. A THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX DEVELOPED
AHEAD OF THE FRONT DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. THIS COMPLEX IS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER JET AND A SHORTWAVE
THROUGH THAT AREA. AN UPPER RIDGE IS CENTERED OVER TEXAS.

OVERNIGHT TRENDS CONTINUE TO SHOW A SCATTERED LINE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS DROPPING SOUTHWARDS. EXPECT THAT THE SOUTHERN
PROGRESSION OF THIS LINE WILL GRADUALLY FIZZLE AS IT MOVES FURTHER
AWAY FROM THE FRONT AND FURTHER AWAY FROM THE BETTER UPPER DYNAMICS
THAT ARE ACROSS MISSOURI AND KENTUCKY. A STRAY STORM OR TWO MAY MAKE
IT INTO NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND INTO NORTHWEST TENNESSEE. ALTHOUGH THE
FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO THE MID SOUTH LATER TODAY...MODELS SHOW
NOT MUCH PUNCH WITH THIS FRONT. ALSO...THE DEPTH OF THE LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE IS FAIRLY LOW AND THE BETTER UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS WILL MOVE
NORTHEAST OF THE REGION TODAY. STILL...INSTABILITY IS RATHER
IMPRESSIVE WITH CAPES GREATER THAN 3000 J/KG AND LI BELOW -5.
WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF AN ISOLATED STORM OR TWO POPS UP TODAY BUT
EXPECT THAT THE AREAL COVERAGE WILL BE RATHER LOW. 850 TEMPS AROUND
+20 AND A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO HIGHS IN THE
MID 90S ONCE AGAIN.

GFS/NAM SOLUTIONS SHOW A MOISTURE AXIS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMNANTS
OF THE FRONT OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI TOMORROW. WOULDNT BE SURPRISED
IF A COUPLE STORMS FIRED UP IN THE AFTERNOON HEATING IN THIS AREA.
AREAL COVERAGE AND CONFIDENCE FACTOR RATHER LOW AND CANT SEE
CHANGING THE ONGOING FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY OF DRY WEATHER AT THIS
POINT.

NAM/GFS/EUROPEAN ALL NOW SHOWING THE POSITION OF THE UPPER RIDGE
EASTWARD SLIDING OUT OF TEXAS ON THURSDAY. AS IT SLIDES TOWARDS THE
MIDSOUTH...THIS SHOULD RESULT IN CONTINUED HOT AND DRY CONDITIONS
INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND. THE FORECAST FOR THE SECOND HALF
OF THE WEEKEND AND THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK BECOMES RATHER TRICKY
DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST TRACK OF RITA. EUROPEAN/GFS IN
GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE STORM WILL MAKE LANDFALL ALONG THE TEXAS
COAST ON SATURDAY. THE STORM IS THEN EXPECTED TO MOVE NORTHWARD
ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THE UPPER RIDGE THROUGH EAST TEXAS SATURDAY
NIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY. THE MIDSOUTH MAY BEGIN TO SEE RAIN BANDS WITH
THIS STORM ON SUNDAY AND COULD PERSIST INTO TUESDAY. THE 00Z GFS
SHOWS THE STORM MOVING THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH ON MONDAY. IT SHOULD BE
STRESSED THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY IN THIS FORECAST.
THE LANDFALL COULD BE MUCH FURTHER SOUTH...PERHAPS INTO MEXICO. IF
THIS OCCURS THEN THE MIDSOUTH MAY NOT SEE ANY RAIN WHATSOEVER FROM
THIS STORM.

HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS NORTHERN ALABAMA. SOUNDINGS THIS MORNING FROM 
KJAN/KLZK SHOW CAPPING INVERSION PRESENT AROUND 725 MB. 850MB 
TEMPERATURES AROUND 20C THIS MORNING SUGGEST TEMPERATURES IN THE 
MIDDLE 90S IN A FEW PLACES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. 
CURRENT FORECAST OVERALL ON TRACK AND WILL NOT ISSUE AN UPDATE AT 
THIS TIME.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 243 AM CDT MON SEP 19 2005...

THE MIDSOUTH IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NEAR ZONAL FLOW...ON THE 
NORTHERN EDGE OF THE UPPER HIGH OVER LOUISIANA. IT WAS MOSTLY 
CLEAR OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. FARTHER NORTH A COMPLEX 
OF THUNDERSTORMS WAS MOVING ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ILLINOIS. A 
COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM SOUTHERN MINNESOTA TO NORTHERN 
NEBRASKA.

A HOT DAY IS ON TAP ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TODAY AND TUESDAY AS 850MB 
TEMPERATURES WARM OUT WEST AND ADVECT INTO THE AREA. WE WILL BE 
FLIRTING WITH THE RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURE OF 97 HERE IN MEMPHIS.  
THE SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL ALSO AID IN BRINGING 
WARM...MOIST AIR TO THE REGION. THE LATEST MODELS AGREE THAT THE 
MOVEMENT OF THE COLD FRONT WILL BE SLIGHTLY SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY 
THOUGHT. THIS REALLY MEANS THAT THE CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER HAS 
SHIFTED NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. 

THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE FA AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 
MODEL SOUNDING SHOW THAT SUFFICIENT MOISTURE...CONVERGENCE AND LIFT 
WILL EXIST TO PRODUCE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE 
BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL BE MAINLY ACROSS THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE 
MIDSOUTH. AS THE FRONT SAGS AND SLOWS ITS SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT... 
RESIDUAL RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER PARTS OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 
WEDNESDAY. THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA WILL BE DRY...AND ONLY SLIGHTLY 
COOLER WITH TEMPERATURES ABOVE THE NORMALS OF 85 AND 63.

FOR NEXT WEEKEND...WE WILL HAVE TO MONITOR TROPICAL STORM RITA FOR 
THE NEXT CHANCES FOR RAINFALL. CURRENT TRACKS TAKE IT TOWARDS THE 
TEXAS GULF COAST. UPPER LEVEL STEERING WINDS TAKE IT ACROSS EASTERN 
TEXAS...ARKANSAS AND THEN MISSOURI BY NEXT TUESDAY.

WHAT IS LEFT OF THE MCS FROM EARLIER TODAY CONTINUES TO MOVE ACROSS
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI AND JUST BRUSHING THE EXTREME NORTHERN COUNTIES
IN THE FORECAST AREA. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD DIE OUT IN THE NEXT HOUR
OR TWO. LOW PRESSURE WAS OVER CENTRAL KANSAS THIS AFTERNOON WITH A
COLD FRONT EXTENDING INTO SOUTHWEST KANSAS. AS THE LOW TRACKS
NORTHEAST THE FRONT WILL EVENTUALLY APPROACH THE REGION BY MONDAY
NIGHT. THERE MAY BE SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE
FRONT ON MONDAY NIGHT ACROSS MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA. SPC HAS THAT AREA IN A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS SO WILL KEEP MENTION OF IT IN THE HWO. WHAT IS LEFT OF
THE FRONT SHOULD WEAKEN BY TUESDAY SO WILL GO WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR
TUESDAY. BOTH MODELS TRY TO SHIFT UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BACK WEST BY THE
MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THE ETA IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS SHIFT AND IN
TURN TRIES TO BRING TD 18 ALONG A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK THAN DOES THE
GFS. AT THIS POINT...NEITHER SCENARIO SHOULD MEAN MUCH IN THE WAY OF
RAIN SO DRY FORECAST WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS

A QUIET MORNING FOR THE MIDSOUTH WITH ONLY A FEW CLOUDS DRIFTING 
ACROSS ARKANSAS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS ANCHORED OVER THE OHIO AND 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEYS. FARTHER WEST...A COMPLEX OF SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS HAS DEVELOPED OVER EASTERN KANSAS. CLOUD DEBRIS FROM 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT FORMED EARLIER OVER WEST TEXAS WAS DRIFTING INTO 
OKLAHOMA. THOSE CLOUDS WERE SHOWING SIGNS OF WARMING.

THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE OHIO/MISSISSIPPI VALLEYS WILL 
BEGIN TO SHIFT EASTWARD TODAY. THIS WILL PUT THE MIDSOUTH ON THE 
WESTERN EDGE OF THE HIGH WHICH WILL ALLOW LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO FEED 
BACK INTO THE AREA...AS WELL AS WARMER TEMPERATURES. THE STEERING 
FLOW FROM THE UPPER HIGH LOCATED OVER FAR EAST TX AND WRN LA WAS 
MOSTLY ZONAL OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WITH THIS FLOW...THE STORMS 
FARTHER WEST MAY CLIP THE NORTHWESTERN EDGE OF THE FA TONIGHT. 
CONFIDENCE IS RATHER LOW AT THIS POINT SO WILL NOT MENTION IN 
UPCOMING FORECAST. 

OF CONCERN WILL BE THE RETURN OF MOISTURE...ESPECIALLY FOR TUESDAY 
AHEAD A COLD FRONT. THE LATEST SWODY2 COVERS THE DETAILS. NOTICED 
THAN THE NAM WAS ABOUT 12 TO 18 HOURS FASTER WITH THE FRONTAL 
MOVEMENT THAN THE GFS. HOWEVER...BOTH MODELS SUGGEST THAT CAPE 
VALUES NEAR 3000 J/KG...CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND 
SUFFICIENT LIFT WILL SUPPORT ANY STORMS THAT DO FORM. THIS FRONT 
WILL BE PUSHED SOUTHWARD FROM A STRONG SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING ACROSS 
THE NRN U.S. INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION.

THE FRONT LOOKS MUCH STRONGER TODAY WHEN COMPARED TO PAST SEVERAL 
MODEL RUNS. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY. 
THE SPEED OF THE FRONT WILL REALLY DETERMINE TEMPERATURES FOR 
TUESDAY...BUT HAVE GONE SLIGHTLY WARMER TRENDING TOWARD THE SLOWER 
SOLUTION OF THE GFS.

THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK LOOKS DRY. PERHAPS BY THE BEGINNING OF 
NEXT WEEK THE AREA MAY BE AFFECTED BY TROPICAL REMNANTS OF WHAT IS 
NOW TROPICAL DEPRESSION 18.

SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WERE DEVELOPING OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI AND 
PARTS OF WEST TENNESSEE THIS MORNING. THIS IS AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT 
THAT STRETCHED FROM SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI TO SOUTHWESTERN ARKANSAS. 

THE SHORTWAVE SPINNING OVER CENTRAL ILLINOIS/INDIANA WILL AID IN 
PUSHING THE COLD FRONT FARTHER EAST AND SOUTH LATER TODAY. A 70KT 
JET ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE TROUGH AXIS WILL PROVIDE THE DYNAMICS TO 
PRODUCE THE BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF 
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. IT APPEARS THAT THESE BETTER CHANCES FOR 
RAIN WILL ROUGHLY BE ALONG AND SOUTH OF A LEXINGTON TN TO CLARKSDALE 
MS. MOISTURE WILL POOL AHEAD OF THE FRONT THUS UNSTABLE CONDITIONS 
WILL RESIDE HERE. THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS PORTION OF 
THE AREA BY THIS EVENING CLEARING OUT THIS MOISTURE AND PROVIDING 
DRIER AND COOLER AIR IN ITS WAKE.

BY SATURDAY THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH OVER SOUTHEASTERN TEXAS MAKES ITS 
PRESENCE KNOWN AS IT BUILDS A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH AND EAST. THIS 
WILL PROVIDE THE MID SOUTH WITH DRY CONDITIONS DURING THE WEEKEND 
FOR THE MOST PART. ONE MINOR CONCERN IS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. THEY WILL BE ON THE NORTHERN PERIMETER OF THE HIGH 
WHICH RAISES CONCERNS FOR ANY CONVECTION THAT FORMS IN THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS. THIS CONVECTION COULD MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN TIER OF THE 
FORECAST AREA SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT. 

ANOTHER WEAK FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA TUESDAY. AT THIS POINT IT 
APPEARS THAT IT WILL BE DRY AHEAD OF IT AND STILL ABOVE NORMAL

A COLD FRONT REMAINS STRETCHED FROM MICHIGAN SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS

TENNESSEE AND NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI THIS AFTERNOON. ADDITIONAL SHOWER
AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL BE POSSIBLE LATER THIS AFTERNOON
IN ADVANCE OF THE SOUTHWARD MOVING COLD FRONT OVER NORTHERN
SECTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH AND ALONG AN OLD CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW
BOUNDARY STRETCHED ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI. WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE
INCREASED POPS ACROSS MAINLY THE SOUTHERN 2/3RDS OF THE FORECAST AREA
TO ACCOUNT FOR ONGOING TRENDS AND ANTICIPATED CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT
THIS AFTERNOON AND LEFT HIGH CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN 1/3RD
AS IS. ALSO HAVE LOWERED HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR AREAS WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER DUE TO ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER AND ONGOING
PRECIPITATION. ONLY OTHER CHANGES HAVE BEEN TO ADJUST WINDS FOR
ONGOING WIND PATTERN. OTHER GRID PARAMETERS LOOK GOOD.

UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONES HAVE BEEN SENT. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR
CONVECTIVE EVOLUTION THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON.


.DISCUSSION FROM 431 AM CDT THIS MORNING...

00Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS THIS MORNING PLACES LONG WAVE TROUGH FROM
WESTERN ONTARIO BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE
ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE WAS MOVING THROUGH THE MID SOUTH WITH 850 MB
MOISTURE POOLING ACROSS CENTRAL ARKANSAS. AT THE SURFACE A COLD FRONT
EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL LAKE SUPERIOR BACK INTO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA. MAIN
CONCERNS THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL ASSOCIATED
WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE BETWEEN TODAY AND FRIDAY.

TODAY...SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS THE
MID SOUTH AND STALL OUT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON.
SOUTH OF THE FRONT...LI/S AROUND -6...SURFACE BASED CAPES BETWEEN
1500-2000 J/KG...AND MARGINAL TO MODERATE 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE
RATES AROUND 6-6.5 C/KM SUGGESTS ANY CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS IN THE
UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT WILL BE OF MULTICELL TYPE WITH MARGINAL WIND
PROFILES ALOFT AND POTENTIAL FOR MAINLY ISOLATED HAIL/WIND THREATS.
IN ADDITION...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL INCREASE TO AROUND 2
INCHES SUGGESTING A POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL WITH ANY
THUNDERSTORMS. LATEST 88D TRENDS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS SHOW A LINE
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEAKENING A BIT AS IT APPROACHES THE
FORECAST AREA. BASED ON CONVECTIVE TRENDS THIS MORNING I/LL GO WITH
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE NORTHWEST
SECTION...SCATTERED POPS ELSEWHERE TAPERING OFF TO ISOLATED CHANCES
ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND PRIMARILY CHANCE POPS
THIS AFTERNOON AS ATMOSPHERE MAY ENCOUNTER SOME DIFFICULTY
DESTABILIZING AGAIN FROM THIS MORNING/S CONVECTION.

TONIGHT...BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODEL RUN SHOW AN EMBEDDED MID LEVEL
SHORTWAVE IN SOUTHWEST FLOW MOVING THROUGH THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY TONIGHT. AN MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO
DEVELOP ACROSS OKLAHOMA AND MOVE ACROSS ARKANSAS OVERNIGHT PRODUCING
ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. INSTABILITY WILL CONTINUE TO
WEAKEN AS THE NIGHT PROGRESSES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AND THINK SEVERE
WEATHER THREAT WILL BE MINIMAL IF ANY.

THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL FINALLY BEGIN TO PUSH
SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE THURSDAY NIGHT. UPPER
LEVEL DYNAMICS WILL IMPROVE AS THE RIGHT REAR QUADRANT OF THE UPPER
LEVEL JET AND 35 KT 850 MB LOW LEVEL JET MOVE ACROSS THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY LATE AFTERNOON. SEVERAL INGREDIENTS SUCH AS
35KT OR GREATER UNIDIRECTIONAL WINDS AT 700/500 MB...POOLING OF 70F
SURFACE DEWPOINTS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...QUASI-STATIONARY SURFACE
FRONT PARALLEL TO UPPER LEVEL FLOW...AND A TONGUE OF 700 MB DEW POINT
DEPRESSIONS AROUND 17C SUGGEST A PROGRESSIVE WARM SEASON BOW ECHO
MAY FORM ALONG THE SURFACE BOUNDARY AND PUSH SOUTH THROUGH THE AREA
THURSDAY NIGHT. MAIN POTENTIAL SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WITH THIS
SCENARIO WOULD BE DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS. WILL HIGHLIGHT
SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL IN THE HWO.

FRIDAY AND BEYOND...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN BEHIND THE FRONT
BRINGING MAINLY PRECIPITATION FREE WEATHER TO THE MID SOUTH AS AN
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE TRIES TO RE-ESTABLISH ITSELF ACROSS THE EASTERN
UNITED STATES.

HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY LOSING ITS GRIP ACRS THE AREA THIS AFTN. THE 
VERY DRY AIRMASS THAT HAD BEEN ACRS THE REGION FOR SEVERAL DAYS IS 
RETREATING TO THE EAST AS INDICATES BY THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. 
INCREASED MOISTURE COMBINED WITH AFTN HEATING AND A WEAK SHORTWAVE 
MOVING INTO ERN AR HAS RESULTED IN ISOLD SHOWERS ACRS THE DELTA THIS 
AFTN. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE SHORT LIVED THIS AFTN BUT WL NEED TO 
MENTION ISOLD POPS IN THE FORECAST UNTIL ABOUT 01Z...OR AROUND 
SUNSET.

OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WE WILL BE SEEING A PATTERN SHIFT AS 
THE STAGNANT UPPER RIDGE ACRS THE REGION WEAKENS AND THE MEAN TROF 
OVER THE WRN STATES MOVES EAST THROUGH THE MID SOUTH PUSHING A 
SURFACE FRONT THROUGH THE REGION WITH GOOD CHANCES FOR RAIN. ANOTHER 
UPPER RIDGE BUILDS ACRS THE REGION THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK 
RESULTING IN ANOTHER STRETCH OF DRY WEATHER. 

TONIGHT...AFTER EVENING CONVECTION DISSIPATES EXPECT DRY WEATHER FOR 
MOST OF THE NIGHT. THE ASSOCD CDFNT WL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE MID 
MS VALLEY LATE TONIGHT. CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS ALONG AND AHEAD OF 
THIS FRONT COULD IMPACT NE AR BY LATE TONIGHT. ELSW...EXPECT A 
LITTLE LESS FOG DUE TO LIGHT SOUTHERLY WINDS. 

WEDNESDAY...THE COLD FRONT WL SAG SOUTH INTO THE EXTREME NORTHERN 
PARTS OF THE MID SOUTH. DYNAMICS NOT TO IMPRESSIVE ON WED WITH MAIN 
SHORTWAVE STILL WELL TO THE WEST. WL HAVE TO RELY ON WEAK SFC 
CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT...OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES THAT MOVE SOUTH 
INTO THE AREA FROM OVERNIGHT CONVECTION ACRS MO/AR AND SFC 
HEATING TO DEVELOP SHOWERS OR TSTMS. WL GO WITH HIGHEST POPS INVOF 
OF SFC FRONT ACRS NRN SXNS WITH LESSER POPS TO THE SOUTH. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT WL BE LOCATED ACRS THE 
REGION. SEVERAL FACTORS POINTING TOWARD POTENTIAL MCS DEVELOPMENT 
ACRS WRN AR WED NIGHT. A DECENT 500 MB SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO THE SRN 
PLAINS. MEANWHILE A STRONG JET STRETCHES NORTH OF THE OH VALLEY WITH 
THE SRN PLAINS LOCATED IN THE DIFFULENT REGION OF THE REAR ENTRANCE 
JET. STRONG MOISTURE TRANSPORT AT 850 MB IS ALSO FORECAST ACRS AR. 
THIS FACTORS SHOULD RESULT IN MCS GENERATION OVER WRN AR WED EVE. 
THE MCS WL PROBABLY REACH THE MS RIVER BY 12Z. THERE IS A SMALL 
RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER WITH THIS SYSTEM. GIVEN THE TIME OF DAY AND 
LACK OF STRONG INSTABILITY THE MAIN THREAT WL PROBABLY BE DAMAGING 
WINDS. IT CONTINUES TO LOOK LIKE ANY THREAT WL BE ROUGHLY NORTH 
OF I-40 LATE WED NIGHT INTO THU MORNING.

THURSDAY...ONGOING MCS WL HAVE A BIG EFFECT ON WEATHER FOR THURSDAY. 
EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACRS MUCH OF THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE MID SOUTH IN THE MORNING. VERY POSSIBLE MCS WL LAY DOWN A STABLE 
AIRMASS ACRS NORTHERN SECTION OF THE MID SOUTH WITH OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES PUSHING INTO NRN MS. ANY AFTN REDEVELOPMENT WL DEPEND ON

A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDED FROM THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY TO

MOSTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE IMAGERY
CONTINUED TO INDICATE A VERY DRY AIR MASS ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. SOME
PATCHY FOG WAS BEING REPORTED...BUT NOT AS PREVALENT AS THE LAST FEW
NIGHTS AS LOWER SURFACE DEWPOINTS HAVE MOVED INTO THE AREA. TODAYS
WEATHER WILL BE ABOUT LIKE YESTERDAY...SUNNY AND WARM.

AS A TROUGH MOVES INTO THE PLAINS. INCREASING SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL

WEDNESDAY WITH THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMING WESTERLY. A COLD
FRONT IS FORECAST TO SLOWLY PUSH INTO THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTH
WEDNESDAY...BECOMING NEARLY STATIONARY EAST TO WEST ACROSS THE AREA

THE FORECAST BECOMES A LITTLE MORE COMPLICATED TOWARD MID-WEEK AND
ESPECIALLY TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEK. HEIGHTS ARE FORECAST TO
LOWER ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY AS THE RIDGE WEAKENS. THIS WILL

HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT COVERS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS THIS
MORNING WITH A NORTHWEST WIND FLOW ALOFT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH.
SATELLITE SHOWS SKIES ARE CLEAR ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATING DRY CONDITIONS AT THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS
OF THE ATMOSPHERE. CALM WINDS HAVE ALLOWED PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP
ACROSS PARTS OF WEST TN INTO NORTHEAST MS WITH A FEW LOCATIONS
REPORTING VISIBILITIES 1/2 TO 1 MILE. WILL INDICATE THIS PATCHY FOG
IN THE GRIDS / ZONES THROUGH EARLY THIS MORNING.

HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WILL BUILD OVER THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST
TODAY...BE OVER THE MIDSOUTH SATURDAY...THEN SETTLE TO THE EAST OF
THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY. ALL IN ALL...RAIN FREE WEATHER IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH INTO NEXT WEEK. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM
A LITTLE THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS THE HIGH BUILDS OVER THE
AREA...AND SOILS DRY SOME. VERY WARM AFTERNOONS AND MILD NIGHTS CAN
BE EXPECTED INTO NEXT WEEK. HURRICANE OPHELIA IS FORECAST TO REMAIN

A RIDGE OVER THE MIDDLE PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP
THE MIDSOUTH DRY TONIGHT WHILE THERE IS A RING OF STORMY WEATHER
AROUND THE RIDGE. STORMS ARE IN AZ UP TO THE CENTRAL ROCKIES.
OTHERS ARE OVER IL/IN/OH. TO THE SOUTH...AN AREA OF DISTURBED
WEATHER IS IN THE WESTERN GULF. HURRICANE OPHELIA IS
STRENGTHENING OFF THE EAST COAST OF FL.

THE WEATHER DRIVER SHOULD BE THE DEEPENING TROUGH ON THE WEST
COAST. THIS WILL MOVE THE UPPER RIDGE SQUARELY OVER US. MOSTLY
SUNNY DAYS AND CLEAR NIGHTS SHOULD PERSIST. DAYS WILL BE WARM AND

.DISCUSSION...
THERE ARE NO FORESEEABLE CHANGES TO THE WEATHER OVER THE MIDSOUTH 
FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS. AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD 
OVER THE REGION DUE TO A TROUGH PHASE AND AMPLIFICATION OVER THE 
WESTERN UNITED STATES. 

ONLY MINOR CONCERN FOR TONIGHT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF FOG. SOME 
STATIONS OVER EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA DROPPED DOWN TO 1/2 MILE 
AT TIMES LAST NIGHT. WITH CLEAR SKIES...LIGHT WINDS...AND DEWPOINTS 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER...BELIEVE THE THREAT FOR PATCHY FOG IS THERE AND 
WILL MENTION IN ZONES FOR EASTERN AREAS. OTHER THAN THAT...ANOTHER 
NICE NIGHT IS ON TAP WITH LOWS IN THE 60S.

NOT MUCH TO SPEAK OF FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST. HIGH TEMPS WILL 
WARM INTO THE UPPER 80S AND LOWER 90S OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 
DESPITE A 595DM RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER US BY SUNDAY...850 TEMPS WILL 
RANGE AROUND 18C. THIS SHOWS THAT THE RIDGE IS MORE OF DOWNSTREAM 
RESPONSE TO THE AMPLIFICATION OF THE TROUGH OUT WEST AND WE WILL NOT 
SEE THE TYPE OF HEAT THAT CAN BE EXPERIENCED WITH THIS TYPE OF UPPER
LEVEL PATTERN. DEEP LAYER MOISTURE WILL REMAIN VERY LIMITED AS 
WELL...KEEPING SKIES MOSTLY CLEAR WITH ONLY A FEW DIURNAL CU 
POSSIBLE. 

ECMWF AND GFS AGREE THAT THE RIDGE AXIS WILL SHIFT EAST BY MIDWEEK 
WITH HEIGHTS LOWERING ACROSS THE REGION...HELPING TEMPS TO COOL BACK 
DOWN A FEW DEGREES. TROPICAL STORM OPHELIA WILL PLAY HAVOC WITH 
FORECASTS ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST AS IT WILL REMAIN IN A WEAK 
STEERING FLOW ALOFT...ALLOWING IT TO MEANDER OFF THE COAST. WITH 
THIS TYPE OF PATTERN AND STORM MOTION...OPHELIA SHOULD NOT BE A 
FACTOR IN OUR WEATHER THROUGH AT LEAST NEXT THURSDAY...IF EVER.

RESPONSE TO AN UPPER LEVEL HIGH THAT IS AMPLIFYING OVER THE HIGH 
PLAINS. ANOTHER DRY DAY IS ON TAP. 12Z LZK SOUNDING AND FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS FOR TODAY INDICATE VERY LITTLE DEEP LAYER MOISTURE...SO 
WHILE A FEW CU CANNOT BE RULED OUT...SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 342 AM THU SEP 8 2005...

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST U.S. THIS
MORNING AND THIS SYSTEM CONTINUES TO RIDGE SOUTHWEST OVER OUR AREA.
THIS HAS PROVIDED ANOTHER MOSTLY CLEAR AND SEASONABLY COOL MORNING...
WITH AREAS OF PATCHY FOG AND TEMPERATURES MAINLY IN THE 60S. THESE
CONDITIONS WILL AGAIN PERSIST THROUGH SUNRISE.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO EXTEND OVER THE MID-SOUTH FOR
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. IN THE UPPER LEVELS...THE AREA REMAINS ON
THE EASTERN EDGE OF A BUILDING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE NOW CENTERED OVER
THE HIGH PLAINS. A WEAK UPPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH SKIRTING ACROSS THE
GREAT LAKES REGION WILL SLIDE INTO THE NORTHEAST U.S. THROUGH THE
WEEKEND. AS THIS SHORTWAVE MOVES EAST...IT WILL ALLOW THE UPPER
RIDGE TO BUILD EASTWARD OVER THE AREA...WITH RISING HEIGHTS AND
THICKNESSES. THIS ALL MEANS THAT MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WILL CONTINUE
OVER THE AREA INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK...WITH A SLOW
WARMING TREND INTO THE WEEKEND.

THE UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE OVER THE REGION THROUGH THE EXTENDED
PORTION OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. WE WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON
TROPICAL STORM OPHELIA...NOW OFF OF THE FLORIDA EAST COAST...FOR THE
END OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD OR BEYOND...AS THERE IS STILL MUCH
UNCERTAINTY WITH THE FORECAST TRACK AND INTENSITY. AT THIS POINT...IT
APPEARS THAT THE SYSTEM WILL STAY NEARLY STATIONARY OFF THE SOUTHEAST
U.S. COAST FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. SO OPHELIA WILL MOST LIKELY NOT
EFFECT OUR WEATHER THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD IF AT ALL. SO KEPT DRY
FORECAST GOING THROUGH THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS WITH NEAR OR SLIGHTLY

UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA HAS ALLOWED FOR
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES HAVE FALLEN BACK INTO
THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S...AND SHOULD ONLY DROP A FEW MORE DEGREES...
AS DEWPOINTS REMAIN MAINLY IN THE 60S...WHICH IS A BIT HIGHER THAN
THE PAST FEW MORNINGS. THIS SHOULD KEEP TEMPS FROM BOTTOMING OUT
ANY LOWER.

A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH IS ALIGNED GENERALLY ALONG THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER THIS MORNING. THIS SUBTLE FEATURE SHOULD CONTINUE
TO MOVE WESTWARD ALLOWING SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO BUILD BACK OVER
THE AREA. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE HAS INCREASED OVER THE PAST DAY OR SO...
AND SHOULD PERSIST OVER THE AREA WITH DEWPOINTS REMAINING IN THE 60S
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THEREFORE...EXPECT AFTERNOON CU FIELDS
TO DEVELOP OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AS WELL...AND HAVE GONE WITH
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES DURING THE DAY WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AT
NIGHT. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL ALSO PERSIST OVER THE AREA THROUGH
MOST OF THE PERIOD...KEEPING PRECIPITATION CHANCES VERY LOW THROUGH
AT LEAST NEXT MONDAY. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL SKIRT ACROSS THE
NORTHERN TIER OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE WEEK...BUT SHOULD REMAIN FAR
ENOUGH TO OUR NORTH AND NOT VERY AMPLIFIED...SO NOT EXPECTING ANY

WILL NEED TO WATCH THE TROPICS FOR FAR INTO THE EXTENDED PERIOD...
AS A DEVELOPING POSSIBLY TROPICAL LOW NOW OFF THE EAST COAST OF
FLORIDA MAY DRIFT NORTHWEST OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...AND SOME
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM MAY WORK ITS WAY INTO PORTIONS
OF OUR AREA BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. STILL MANY QUESTION MARKS WITH THIS

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS OVER THE CNTRL U.S. WL GRADUALLY SHIFT 
TO THE SOUTHERN GULF STATES THROUGH THE NEXT WEEK. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE MS VALLEY WL SLOWLY SHIFT EAST TO THE EASTERN

EXPECT PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND SEASONABLE TEMPS THROUGH THE UPCOMING 
WORK WEEK. HIGH TEMPS WL BE IN THE UPPER 80S TO AROUND 90 WITH 
COMFORTABLE HUMIDITIES AND LIGHT WINDS. 

GFS INDICATES THAT BY NEXT WEEKEND THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE SHIFTS TO 
THE SOUTHERN STATES AS A SIGNIFICANT TROF MOVES INTO THE CNTRL 
STATES. WITH THIS SOLUTION THE SURFACE HIGH WL SLIP OFF THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD RESULTING IN A RETURN OF SOUTHERLY FLOW AND MARGINALLY 
HIGHER DEWPOINTS ON SAT. THE 12Z ECMWF SOLUTION KEEPS THE TROF 
FURTHER NORTH WITH A STRONGER RIDGE ACRS THE SOUTHERN STATES.

SURFACE MAP PLACES A WEAKENING COLD FRONT EXTENDING FROM INDIANA 
INTO SOUTHERN MISSOURI. HIGH PRESSURE IS OVER THE MIDSOUTH REGION 
AND HAS BROUGHT MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS TO THE AREA. THE UPPER FLOW 
IS GENERALLY RATHER FLAT ACROSS MOST OF THE NATION. 

OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...AN UPPER RIDGE WILL BE BUILDING OVER THE 
PLAINS. AS THIS DOES SO...THE SURFACE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE THAT 
EXTENDS FROM THE MIDSOUTH INTO NORTHEAST KANSAS WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT 
MORE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. THE END RESULT IS THAT THE FLOW AROUND 
THE HIGH WILL BRING IN COOLER AIR INTO THE MIDSOUTH OVER THE 
WEEKEND. 

THE SURFACE FRONT WILL LIKELY MOVE INTO THE REGION TONIGHT...BUT IT 
IS EXTREMELY WEAK WITH LITTLE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH. SO NO RAIN IS 
EXPECTED TONIGHT OR TOMORROW. THERE IS REALLY NO APPRECIABLY COOLER 
AIR BEHIND THIS FRONT FOR THE MIDSOUTH...PERHAPS A DEGREE OR TWO. 
GFS/ETA/EUROPEAN ALL SHOW COOLER AIR MOVING INTO THE 
REGION...ALTHOUGH IT MAY BE MORE LIKE SUNDAY. BASED UPON TRENDS 
TODAY THE FWC GUIDANCE LOOKS TO BE TOO WARM. COOLER AND DRY WEATHER 
ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST WITH NO SYSTEMS

...DISCUSSION...

...DANGEROUS HURRICANE KATRINA EXPECTED TO MAKE LANDFALL ON THE
SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA COASTLINE THIS MORNING...

NOTE...THIS DISCUSSION MAY BE UPDATED AFTER NHC 08Z CONFERENCE CALL.

REMNANTS OF OUTER RAINBAND RUNNING FROM PARIS TENNESSEE TO ABOUT
WYNNE ARKANSAS AND MOVING SLOWLY NORTH. ANOTHER BAND MOVING INTO
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI FROM THE SOUTH. EYEWALL OF STORM PROBABLY
MAKING LANDFALL ON LOUISIANA COAST AROUND 11Z OR 12Z.

CURRENT CONDITIONS ACROSS MIDSOUTH ARE MAINLY CLOUDY WITH TEMPS IN
THE 70S. WINDS NOT AN ISSUE...YET.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
KATRINA...OF COURSE...IS THE FORECAST PROBLEM. FORECAST TRACK
CHANGES OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS HAVE BEEN NEGLIGIBLE...AND VERY
CONSISTENT WITH RESPECT TO LOCATION. GFS MODEL SOLUTION MOVES
SYSTEM QUICKER THAN NAM...BY ABOUT 12 HOURS. NHC SOLUTION RATHER
CLOSE TO GFS AT PRESENT. AS LONG AS THERE ARENT SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES ON 08Z CONFERENCE CALL...CURRENT BOUNDARIES OF WIND/WATER
ISSUANCES LOOK REASONABLE. WILL UPGRADE INLAND TROPICAL STORM WATCH
TO WARNING WITH THIS ISSUANCE.

HPC STILL INDICATING POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT RAINS WITH THIS
SYSTEM...ON THE ORDER OF 3 TO 5 INCHES...MAINLY OVERNIGHT TONIGHT.
SEE NO REASON TO MESS WITH FLOOD WATCH AT THIS TIME.

TIME OF GREATEST THREAT FOR BOTH WIND AND RAIN STILL LOOKS TO BE 00Z-
18Z TUESDAY. SEVERE THREAT ALSO POSSIBLE ALONG AND EAST OF STORM
TRACK.

ASSUMING THAT GFS SOLUTION IS CLOSE...CONDITIONS WILL BEGIN EASING
TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH WEDNESDAY BEING DRY.

SEE NO REASON TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO CLOUD AND TEMPERATURE
GRIDS IN SHORT TERM. CATEGORICAL POPS FOR MOST OF CWA FOR THIS
AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY AFTERNOON.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER WEDNESDAY)...
CONSIDERING ISSUES IN SHORT TERM PORTION OF FORECAST...OPTED TO
LEAVE LONG TERM FORECAST STAND AS IS. BASICALLY DRY WITH
TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL FOR LATE AUGUST-EARLY SEPTEMBER.
&&

.MEG WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES
AR...NONE.

MS...FLOOD WATCH 7 PM TONIGHT TO 1 PM TUESDAY ALL COUNTIES.

...DISCUSSION...

...EXTREMELY DANGEROUS HURRICANE KATRINA CONTINUING TO BEAR DOWN ON
THE SOUTHEAST LOUISIANA COASTLINE...

THE FIRST OUTER RAINBAND ASSOCIATED WITH KATRINA HAS BEEN ROTATING
NORTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. ENHANCED LOW
LEVEL CONVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE KATRINA ALTERED WIND FIELD HAS
ALLOWED FOR THIS CONVECTIVE BAND TO DEVELOP. HAVE HAD SEVERE WINDS
WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS EMBEDDED WITHIN THIS BAND...WITH TREES
REPORTED DOWN ACROSS THE RIPLEY AREA IN TIPPAH COUNTY EARLIER THIS
EVENING. EXPECT CONTINUED THUNDERSTORMS WITHIN SPIRAL BANDS THAT
ROTATE INTO THE AREA. ANOTHER ONE OF THESE BANDS CURRENTLY STRETCHED
ACROSS CENTRAL ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI MOVING TOWARDS US. WITH THIS
CONTINUING THROUGH THE NIGHT...HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS IN PLACE ACROSS
THE ENTIRE AREA. EXPECT A QUICK SHOT OF STRONG GUSTY WINDS AND
PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE AS THESE BANDS MOVE QUICKLY NORTHWEST
THROUGH THE NIGHT. CANNOT RULE OUT ISOLATED SEVERE WINDS WITH ANY OF
THE STRONGEST CONVECTION. HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THIS THREAT IN THE LATEST
HWO AND WILL MENTION IN AN UPDATED SPS TO BE ISSUED BEFORE MIDNIGHT.

LATEST INFORMATION FROM 9 PM HURRICANE CONFERENCE CALL KEEPS THE
HURRICANE TRACKING NORTH-NORTHWEST FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS BEFORE A
TURN TO THE NORTH AND EVENTUALLY NORTH-NORTHEAST ACROSS SOUTHEAST
PORTIONS OF OUR AREA. THE INTENSITY REMAINS SIMILAR TO THE PREVIOUS
ADVISORY WITH 160 MPH SUSTAINED WINDS WITH HIGHER GUSTS. THE LATEST
FORECAST LANDFALLS KATRINA AS A STRONG CATEGORY 4 OR CATEGORY 5
HURRICANE NEAR NEW ORLEANS ON MONDAY MORNING. SHOULD BE A DEVASTATING
SITUATION ALONG AND JUST EAST OF WHERE LANDFALL OCCURS.

EFFECTS TO OUR WEATHER TOMORROW...

WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE OUTER RAINBANDS ROTATE ACROSS THE AREA WITH
GUSTY WINDS AND BRIEF HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE. REFER TO THE LATEST
STATEMENTS FOR UPDATED INFORMATION THROUGH THE DURATION OF THIS
EVENT. JUST A FINAL COMMENT...CONFIDENCE IS INCREASING SOMEWHAT IN
THE FACT THAT SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IMPACTS WILL BE FELT ACROSS
PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...ESPECIALLY
OVER PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI.

UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONES OUT SHORTLY. SORRY FOR THE DELAY...VERY BUSY
NIGHT.

...HURRICANE KATRINA EXPECTED TO HAVE IMPACTS ON THE MID SOUTH 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY...

.DISCUSSION...LATEST INFORMATION FROM TPC AND AND USAF RECONAISSANCE 
AIRCRAFT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO PLACE HURRICANE KATRINA 150 MILES 
SOUTH OF THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS 
OF 165 MPH...AND HIGHER GUSTS CLASSIFY THIS SYSTEM NEAR A 
CATASTROPHIC CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE. MEANWHILE...THE COLD FRONT 
APPROACHING YESTERDAY BECAME QUASI-STATIONARY ACROSS SOUTHERN 
ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI TODAY.

TONIGHT...HURRICANE KATRINA IS EXPECTED TO MAKE LANDFALL SOMEWHERE 
NEAR NEW ORLEANS TOWARD MORNING WHILE QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARY WILL 
STILL BE UPSTREAM OF THE FORECAST AREA. CONVECTION FROM THIS 
AFTERNOON HAS MAINLY BEEN ALONG AND SOUTH OF A LINE FROM PARIS 
TENNESSEE TO FORREST CITY ARKANSAS. AS A RESULT WILL CARRY SCATTERED 
POPS ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT.

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WENT WITH CATEGORICAL POPS MONDAY AFTERNOON 
THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA AS THE TROPICAL 
SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. MODEL 
SUSTAINED WINDS ACROSS THE INLAND TROPICAL STORM WATCH AREA SUGGEST 
SUSTAINED WINDS WILL BE 40 TO 50 MPH WITH WINDS UP TO 65 MPH ACROSS 
THE SOUTHEAST SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH WIND GRADIENT 
RELAXING A BIT AWAY FROM THE CENTER. PRIMARY SEVERE THUNDERSTORM 
THREAT AREA WILL BE ACROSS SOUTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE AREA. HEAVY 
RAINFALL DEFINITELY NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES BETWEEN 2.5 TO 3 INCHES ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO THE FIRST HALF OF TUESDAY. WINDS WILL BEGIN TO RELAX 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY AS THE TROPICAL 
SYSTEM CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND MOVE NORTHEAST. STILL TOO EARLY TO 
UPGRADE WATCH AREAS TO WARNINGS AT THIS TIME BUT EXPANDED INLAND 
TROPICAL STORM WATCH WEST TO AREAS PRIMARILY ALONG AND EAST OF A 
MICHIGAN CITY TO CHARLESTON LINE.

LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...DECENT MODEL AGREEMENT WITH 
THE HANDLING OF THE FUTURE REMNANTS OF HURRICANE KATRINA. 00Z 
CANADIAN AND 06Z GFS SPEED UP THE MERGING OF THE REMNANTS WITH UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGHT ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. HOWEVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF EUROPEAN RUNS HAVE BEEN A BIT SLOWER WITH THE PRORGRESSION 
OF THIS FEATURE. BASED ON CURRENT ACCELERATION OF THE HURRICANE WILL 
LEAN TOWARDS GFS/CANADIAN SOLUTION.

...HURRICANE KATRINA MAY HAVE SIGNIFICANT IMPACTS TO PORTIONS OF
   THE MID-SOUTH FOR THE BEGINNING OF THIS WEEK...

A NEARLY STATIONARY BOUNDARY IS STRETCHED TO OUR NORTH ACROSS
SOUTHERN ILLINOIS...SOUTHERN MISSOURI...AND WEST INTO KANSAS
TONIGHT. SOME CONVECTION HAS FIRED ALONG THE FRONT AND IS ONLY
MOVING SLOWLY SOUTH. DO NOT THINK THAT THE FRONT WILL MAKE MUCH MORE
PROGRESS TO THE SOUTH. IN THE UPPER LEVELS...A WEAK 500 MB TROUGH
AXIS REMAINS STRETCHED TO OUR SOUTH. NOT ANYTHING IN THE WAY OF
CONVECTION WITH THIS FEATURE...AND WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING AND
NO DEFINITIVE LOW LEVEL BOUNDARY TO FOCUS CONVECTIVE DEVELOP...
THINK OVERALL CHANCES ARE LOW. WILL THEREFORE REDUCE POPS TO SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR
THUNDERSTORMS STILL POSSIBLE DUE TO THE WARM/MOIST AIRMASS.
OVERNIGHT LOWS CURRENTLY FORECAST IN THE LOW TO MID 70S LOOKS GOOD
AT THIS POINT. DID ALSO MAKE A MINOR ADJUSTMENT TO CLOUD GRIDS TO
GO MOSTLY CLOUDY TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS.

NOW TO THE BIG STORY...DANGEROUS HURRICANE KATRINA CHURNING ITS WAY
WEST NORTHWEST ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. JUST GOT OFF OF
CONFERENCE CALL WITH THE HURRICANE CENTER AND CURRENT NHC TRACK
BRINGS THE SYSTEM ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND WEST CENTRAL
TENNESSEE ON TUESDAY AS A TROPICAL STORM. KATRINA IS FORECAST TO
LANDFALL NEAR NEW ORLEANS ON MONDAY MORNING...POSSIBLY AS A STRONG
CATEGORY 4 HURRICANE. THE CURRENT FORECAST TRACK LOOKS VERY
REASONABLE AS A MID LATITUDE TROUGH MOVING INTO THE PLAINS STATES IS
BEGINNING TO ERODE THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE...WHICH
HAS BEEN STEERING KATRINA WESTWARD OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. THE
HURRICANE SHOULD START TO BEND TO THE NORTHWEST AND EVENTUALLY
NORTH OVER THE NEXT ONE TO TWO DAYS AS A RESULT OF THE TROUGH.
WEATHER IMPACTS MAY BE SIGNIFICANT ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH
BEGINNING MONDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUING TUESDAY...WITH A HEAVY RAIN...
HIGH WIND...AND SEVERE THREAT POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY OVER EASTERN
PORTIONS OF THE AREA. A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT WILL BE ISSUED
SHORTLY TO HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL THREATS.

TONIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY TRY TO MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH 
TONIGHT...POSSIBLY MOVING AS FAR SOUTH AS I-40. INSTABILITY HAS BEEN 
LIMITED TODAY BY EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER ACROSS MUCH OF THE MID SOUTH 
WITH TEMPERATURES ONLY REACHING THE UPPER 70S TO AROUND 80 IN MOST 
AREAS. WILL KEEP SCATTERED POPS IN TONIGHT WITH FRONT IN VICINITY. 

SUNDAY...FRONT IS ANTICIPATED TO STALL OUT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WITH 
SURFACE FLOW PARALLEL TO UPPER LEVEL FLOW. SOUTH OF THE 
BOUNDARY...LI/S AROUND -5...AROUND 2000 J/KG CAPE...AND WEAK UPPER 
LEVEL WINDS SUGGEST CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL RESEMBLE PULSE TYPE 
CONVECTION. CURRENTLY THINK THAT MOST IF NOT ALL STORMS WILL REMAIN 
BELOW SEVERE LIMITS WITH CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE REGION. 

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...HURRICANE KATRINA SHOULD MAKE LANDFALL 
DURING THE MORNING HOURS SOMEWHERE NEAR NEW ORLEANS. LAST FEW RUNS 
OF THE GFS/EUROPEAN/CANADIAN/UKMET AND TPC DISCUSSIONS BRING THE 
CENTER NEAR THIS MENTIONED AREA. MEANWHILE...QUASI-STATIONARY 
BOUNDARY WILL BEGIN TO RETROGRADE NORTH DURING THE DAY. AS A 
RESULT...WENT WITH PRIMARILY CHANCE POPS IN THE MORNING INCREASING 
TO LIKELY BY AFTERNOON ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AS THE OUTER 
BANDS FROM KATRINA BEGIN TO AFFECT THE MID SOUTH. 

MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...HURRICANE KATRINA WILL MOVE AS FAR NORTH 
AS CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI BY 12Z TUESDAY MORNING WITH MOST AREAS UNDER
CATEGORICAL POPS. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW 20-25 KT SUSTAINED WINDS NEAR THE 
SURFACE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER OR TWO OF COUNTIES BY EARLY 
TUESDAY. STILL TOO FAR OUT AT THIS POINT TO ISSUE ANY WIND 
HEADLINES...BUT LATER SHIFTS WILL ISSUE IF FORECAST DATA SUPPORTS 
CURRENT THINKING. WILL MENTION HEAVY RAINFALL WORDING IN THE HWO 
WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES BETWEEN 2-3 INCHES. 

WEDNESDAY AND BEYOND...WILL CARRY 20 POPS DURING THE DAY ON 
WEDNESDAY WITH FORECAST AREA ON SOUTHWEST FRINGE OF THE FUTURE 
REMNANTS OF KATRINA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD BACK INTO THE 
MID SOUTH BY THURSDAY.

THUNDERSTORMS FORMED EARLIER THIS EVENING ALONG A WEAK SURFACE
TROUGH TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS CONVECTIVE COMPLEX
MOVED SOUTHEAST AND CONTINUES TO MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS WEST
TENNESSEE. THE AIRMASS REMAINS VERY WARM AND HUMID WITH
TEMPERATURES PRIMARILY IN THE 70S WHERE RAIN HAS FALLEN AND 80S
ELSEWHERE.

UPPER RIDGE STILL FIRMLY ENTRENCHED OVER THE SOUTHERN U.S. WITH A
SERIES OF SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING UP OVER THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY
OF THE RIDGE INTO PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH. EXPECT THESE UPPER LEVEL
DISTURBANCES COMBINED WITH CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES AND A WARM/HUMID
AIRMASS TO CONTINUE CONVECTION THROUGH THE NIGHT. BEST CHANCES
SHOULD REMAIN ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA...CLOSEST TO THE
UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT. SHEAR REMAINS WEAK ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA...
WITH THE BETTER SHEAR PROFILES TO OUR NORTH. SINCE SHEAR IS WEAK
AND WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...THINK THAT OVERALL SEVERE
THREAT CONTINUES TO DIMINISH.

WITH ALL THIS IN MIND...HAVE MADE SOME MINOR GRID CHANGES TO
REFLECT ONGOING WEATHER. WILL HAVE UPDATED GRIDS AND FORECAST OUT
SHORTLY.

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD FRONT FROM CENTRAL 
IOWA TO KANSAS AND OKLAHOMA. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...A PRE-FRONTAL 
SURFACE TROUGH WAS LOCATED FROM SAINT LOUIS TO SOUTH CENTRAL 
MISSOURI. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE 
POTENTIAL THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY NEXT WEEK AND THE POTENTIAL EFFECTS 
OF HURRICANE KATRINA ON THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.

TONIGHT...PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH SOUTHEAST MISSOURI 
DURING THE EARLY EVENING. WILL CARRY A CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS ACROSS 
NORTHERN SECTIONS WHERE BETTER CONVERGENCE WILL BE PRESENT AND 
TAPERED OF POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT. MOST IF NOT ALL CONVECTION SHOULD 
GRADUALLY DIMINISH WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME INSTABILITY. 

SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH 
BY SATURDAY EVENING. NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS 
OF THIS SYSTEM AS THE BETTER FORCING WILL BE UP ACROSS MICHIGAN. 
ADDITIONALLY...WEAK WINDS ALOFT /PRIMARILY BELOW 20 KTS/...WEAKENING 
INSTABILITY WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING /MLCAPES DROPPING DOWN 
TO AROUND 1000 J/KG/ SUGGEST ANY CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS SHOULD 
REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS AND PRIMARILY EXHIBIT PULSE THUNDERSTORM 
CHARACTERISTICS DURING THE DAY. WILL CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS FOR SUNDAY WITH FRONT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA.

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...SOME CONSISTENCY ISSUES WITH HANDLING OF 
HURRICANE KATRINA AS IT MOVES ONSHORE ACROSS THE GULF COAST AND THE 
EFFECTS THAT THE MID SOUTH MAY EXPERIENCE NEXT WEEK. LATEST GFS/UKMET 
TAKE THE SYSTEM THROUGH NEW ORLEANS/GULFPORT WHILE EUROPEAN SOLUTION 
IS CLOSER TOWARDS MOBILE/PENSACOLA. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH...THE 12Z 
GFS TAKES THE REMNANTS UP THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA THROUGH 
WESTERN TENNESSEE THEN THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. MEANWHILE THE NAM 
TAKES KATRINA FURTHER EAST THROUGH THE PANHANDLE OF FLORIDA. FOR NOW 
THINK 00Z/12Z GFS AND 06Z EUROPEAN SOLUTION HAVE BETTER CONSENSUS 
WITH TRACK NEAR SOUTHERN ALABAMA/PANHANDLE OF FLORIDA. ADDED SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS INTO THE FORECAST FOR TUESDAY ACROSS THE EXTREME 
SOUTHEAST SECTION OF NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. LATER SHIFTS WILL ADJUST

CONVECTIVE COMPLEX MOVING EAST-SOUTHEASTWARD INTO NORTH-CENTRAL MS
THIS EVENING. SATELLITE INDICATED TOPS ARE WARMING ACROSS OUR
FORECAST AREA IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS COMPLEX. RADARS INDICATING
THE PRECIPITATION GRADUALLY DISSIPATING FROM NEAR MEMPHIS SOUTHWARD
ACROSS NORTHWEST MS. THE ONLY REMAINING THUNDERSTORMS AS INDICATED
BY THE LIGHTNING DETECTORS ARE NEAR BATESVILLE MS AND SOUTHWARD...AS
THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMES CAPPED WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.

HARD TO PINPOINT THE EXACT LOCATION OF THE NEARLY STATIONARY SURFACE
FRONT THIS EVENING...BUT BASED ON DEWPOINTS IT RUNS FROM MIDDLE TN
ACROSS NORTHWEST TN INTO SOUTHWEST MO.

CURRENT THINKING IS THAT PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE TO DIMINISH
ACROSS NORTH MS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX. WILL
LEAVE IN A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS TONIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
WITH THE SURFACE FRONT THROUGH THE AREA. IN ADDITION...A WEAK SHORT
WAVE IS FORECAST TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA FROM THE WEST. HOWEVER...
WILL WAIT UNTIL THE PRECIPITATION OVER NORTH MS DECREASES FURTHER
BEFORE UPDATING. MAY NEED TO LEAVE IN A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR
PART OF NORTHEAST MS DEPENDING ON HOW THE NORTHERN PART OF THE
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX MOVING TOWARD THIS AREA EVOLVES.

WILL INCREASE THE SKY COVER ACROSS THE AREA SOME...ALTHOUGH DO THINK
THE CLOUDS WILL THIN LATER TONIGHT. FORECAST LOWS LOOK OK.


.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 215 PM CDT TUE AUG 23 2005

MUCH MORE CLOUD COVER ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND WEST
TENNESSEE TODAY VS YESTERDAY. THUS MAX TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN
SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN CURRENT FORECAST. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FORMED
OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS TODAY. A BOUNDARY SEPARATING SOME SLIGHTLY
DRIER/COOLER AIR STRETCHES ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...JUST SOUTH OF
THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL TO JUST NORTH OF JACKSON TN. OTHER
THUNDERSTORMS WERE BEGINNING TO DEVELOP OVER PARTS OF NORTH
MISSISSIPPI. LAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN CHALLENGING TO SAY THE LEAST

OVERNIGHT THE CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS WILL
MOVE EASTWARD INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND WEST TENNESSEE. SOME MUCH
NEEDED RAIN WILL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE TO FINALLY MOVE INTO THE
MIDSOUTH TONIGHT.

THIS COMPLEX SHOULD HOLD TOGETHER OVERNIGHT AND INTO THE MID MORNING
HOURS. BELIEVE THAT ONCE CLOUDS THIN OUT OVER THE AREA...
TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM UP INTO THE LOWER 90S. EXPECTING SOME
SCATTERED AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ONCE AGAIN WEDNESDAY.

FORECASTING THE RAIN CHANCES THURSDAY AND FRIDAY ARE TOUGH. ANY
SMALL SCALE FEATURE THAT RIDES ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE UPPER RIDGE
WILL HAVE THE POSSIBILITY OF SPARKING SOME CONVECTION IN THE
MOIST/UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE OVER THE MIDSOUTH. GENERALLY MAX TEMPS

CURRENT RADAR IMAGES SHOW A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER 
SOUTHERN MISSOURI/NORTH-CENTRAL ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. IN 
ADDITION...A MCS HAS DEVELOPED OVER SOUTHWESTERN KANSAS AND THE 
OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE. LOOKING AT THE 00Z MODELS...THE NAM HAS 
INITIATED WELL WITH THESE FEATURES THUS HAVE BASED FORECAST FOR THE 
NEXT 24 HOURS ON THE NAM. THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER 
SOUTHERN MISSOURI AND NORTHERN ARKANSAS ARE DEVELOPING ALONG A 
STATIONARY FRONT THAT HAS MEANDER OVER THE REGION OVER THE LAST FEW 
DAYS. EXPECT ACTIVITY FROM SOUTHERN MISSOURI/NORTHERN ARKANSAS TO 
MOVE INTO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH LATER THIS MORNING. 
EXPECT OTHER TYPICAL SCATTERED SUMMERTIME SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY TO FIRE UP THIS AFTERNOON. REMNANTS FROM MCS IN 
KANSAS/OKLAHOMA WILL STAY WEST OF THE CWA. WILL LOWER POPS TO 30/40 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA. WITH REGARDS TO TEMPERATURES...THERE IS A 
FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUDS ACROSS EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA AT THIS 
TIME. IF SIMILAR TRENDS WERE TO HAPPEN LAST NIGHT...THESE CLOUDS 
THINNED OUT BY MORNING LEAVING FOR ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AT LEAST FOR 
THE MORNING HOURS BEFORE THE CU DEVELOPS...WHICH EXPECT TO HAPPEN 
AGAIN TODAY. THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM UP TO HIGHS IN THE 
LOW 90S TO THE NORTH AND MID 90S TO THE SOUTH. WITH THESE VALUES 
HEAT INDEX READINGS SHOULD STAY BELOW HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA.

TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...EXPECT MUCH OF THE SAME WITH STATIONARY 
FRONT STILL LINGERING AROUND TO PRODUCE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND THE AREA. LOWS WILL AGAIN BE IN THE 
70S AND HIGHS IN THE 90S.

UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL HELP TO 
DIMINISH RAIN CHANCES TO NONE TO ISOLATED AT MOST. TEMPERATURES WILL 
STAY MUCH AS THE SAME.

BY SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...AN UPPER

.DISCUSSION...00Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS PLACES LOW PRESSURE OVER THE 
CANADIAN MARITIMES WITH A LONGWAVE TROUGH EXTENDING THROUGH 
MISSOURI. AT THE SURFACE...QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARY IS PLACED 
ACROSS MISSOURI. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR OVERNIGHT IS CONVECTIVE 
POTENTIAL. 

REGIONAL RADAR TRENDS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS HAVE SHOWN CONVECTION 
HAVING A HARD TIME SUSTAINING ITSELF ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WITH LESS 
THAN IDEAL MOISTURE AT 850 MB. IN ADDITION...INFRARED SATELLITE HAS 
SHOWN WARMING CLOUD TOPS ALONG WITH A DECREASE IN LIGHTNING ACROSS 
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH THE EXCEPTION ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL 
KANSAS WHERE SOME CONVECTION OVER THE PAST HOUR HAS DEVELOPED. 
CURRENT THINKING IS THAT THIS FEATURE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
OVERNIGHT AND WEAKEN AS IT ENTERS A LESS THAN FAVORABLE AIR MASS.  
ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN UNSTABLE WITH 2000 J/KG OF MOST UNSTABLE CAPE 
AND LI/S AROUND -4. HOWEVER WITH CONVECTIVE INHIBITION 
PRESENT...POOR 850-700 MB/700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES BELOW 6 
C/KM...AND CURRENT CONVECTIVE TRENDS DO NOT JUSTIFY MORE THAN 
SCATTERED POPS AT THIS TIME FOR OVERNIGHT AND ON TUESDAY. WILL ALSO 
ADJUST TEMPERATURES BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS.

.DISCUSSION...

A BROAD UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ENTRENCHED OVER THE MID-
SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. VERY HOT TEMPERATURES AND HIGH HUMIDITY
LEVELS ONCE AGAIN EXIST THIS AFTERNOON...WITH MANY LOCATIONS ONCE
AGAIN AROUND 100 DEGREES AND HEAT INDICES NEAR 110 DEGREES AT MANY
LOCATIONS. THE INTENSE HEATING ALONG WITH A MOIST AIRMASS HAS
ALLOWED THE THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT TO BECOME FAVORABLE FOR
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE AREA...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTH
MISSISSIPPI. LAPS DATA INDICATING SB-CAPES AROUND 4000 J/KG AND
LIS TO -6. ALTHOUGH ATMOSPHERIC WINDS AND SHEAR ARE WEAK...THE
UNSTABLE THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT WILL SUPPORT ISOLATED PULSE
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THIS EVENING. THE PRIMARY THREAT
FROM ANY SEVERE STORM THAT DEVELOPS WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS. ALREADY
REPORTS OF WIND DAMAGE FROM CHICKASAW COUNTY. THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY
SHOULD BEGIN TO DIMINISH AS WELL AS THE ATTENDANT SEVERE THREAT
AFTER SUNSET. TEMPERATURES IN AREAS OUTSIDE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL
REMAIN VERY HOT.

THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK STATIONARY FRONT STRETCHED
ACROSS EXTREME NORTHERN COUNTIES OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A
STRONGER FRONT STRETCHED ACROSS CENTRAL ILLINOIS...NORTHERN
MISSOURI...BACK INTO NEBRASKA. THE OPERATIONAL MODELS HAVE DONE A
RATHER POOR JOB WITH FORECASTING THE SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF THE
FRONTS. LOOKING AT THE LATEST UPPER AIR DATA AND ACTUAL TRENDS
TODAY...NOW BELIEVE THAT THE FRONT WILL HAVE A REALLY TOUGH TIME
MAKING PROGRESS SOUTH THROUGH OUR FORECAST AREA...AS THE UPPER FLOW
HAS BECOME ALIGNED WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARIES AND THE UPPER TROUGH
NOW MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES HAS NOT BECOME AS AMPLIFIED AS
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. THERE WILL STILL BE SOME AMPLIFICATION OF THE
UPPER TROUGH AS A SHORTWAVE DIGS THROUGH THE BASE OF THE TROUGH
INTO THE MID ATLANTIC REGION AND THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE
INTER-MOUNTAIN WEST IN RESPONSE TO THE DIGGING TROUGH. BUT STILL
THINK THAT THE RIDGE OVER THE AREA WILL HOLD STRONG ENOUGH TO SHUNT
THE MAJORITY OF THE COOLER AND DRIER AIR TO OUR NORTHEAST.

UNFORTIONATELY THIS MEANS MORE HOT AND HUMID WEATHER TO CONTINUE
THROUGH THE WEEK. THINK THAT TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES
COOLER TOMORROW AS COMPARED TO TODAY AS LIGHT NORTHEAST WINDS TRY
AND FILTER SLIGHTLY COOLER AIRMASS SOUTHWARD. BUT STILL VERY HUMID
CONDITIONS...AND THIS COMBINED WITH TEMPERATURES STILL IN THE MID
90S IN THE SOUTH HALF OF THE AREA...BELIEVE HEAT INDICES OVER THESE
AREAS WILL ONCE AGAIN REACH ABOVE 105 AND HAVE EXTENDED THE HEAT
ADVISORY THROUGH MONDAY OVER THESE AREAS. ALSO EXPECT OLD
CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES TO COMBINE WITH DAYTIME HEATING TO
PRODUCE MORE SCATTERED AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS (AGAIN SOME PULSE
SEVERE POSSIBLE) ON MONDAY AFTERNOON. MODELS SHOWING BULLS-EYE OF
QPF OVER THE AREA IN RESPONSE TO AN MCV OVER SOUTHWEST MISSOURI
TRYING TO MOVE SOUTHEAST. THINK THAT THIS FEATURE WILL STAY NORTH AND
WE WILL BE LEFT WITH PRIMARILY DIURNAL CONVECTION.

HOT AND HUMID WEATHER SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEK AS THE EASTERN
TROUGH DEPARTS AND UPPER RIDGING SLOWLY BUILDS OVERHEAD. THINK THAT
DAYTIME HEATING...OLD CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES...AND PROXIMITY OF
SLOWLY SOUTHWARD MOVING FRONT WILL SUPPORT MORE SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. FRONT SHOULD WASH OUT BY
THURSDAY AND WE WILL BE LEFT WITH DRY AND HOT WEATHER AND
DIMINISHED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS

TO YESTERDAY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE AREA.
TEMPERATURES ARE A FEW DEGREES COOLER ACROSS NORTHERN TIER
COUNTIES. SURFACE DEWPOINTS ARE ALSO HIGHER AREAWIDE THIS MORNING AS
COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.

REGIONAL WATER VAPOR IMAGERY MOVING ACROSS EASTERN ARKANSAS INTO
WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI THIS MORNING. ALSO...VISIBLE
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING CONVECTIVE CLOUD COVER OVER THESE AREAS
IN RESPONSE TO THIS FEATURE. DUE TO THE SUBTLE NATURE OF THIS SYSTEM
AND NO SIGNIFICANT LOW LEVEL FEATURES PRESENT TO FOCUS CONVECTION...
THINK THAT CURRENT FORECAST OF LOW END CHANCE POPS LOOKS GOOD.
SHOULD SEE A BIT OF AN INCREASE IN SCATTERED THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE
LATER TODAY...AS REGIONAL 12Z SOUNDINGS SHOW A MOIST AND UNCAPPED
ENVIRONMENT...AND CONTINUED DAYTIME HEATING SHOULD LEAD TO
INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE CONDITIONS.

SINCE TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITY LEVELS ARE ON TRACK TO PRODUCE HEAT
INDICES BETWEEN 105-110 DEGREES ACROSS MOST OF THE MID-SOUTH AGAIN
THIS AFTERNOON...HAVE DECIDED TO EXPAND THE CURRENT HEAT ADVISORY
FURTHER NORTH TO INCLUDE ALL BUT OUR FAR NORTHERN TIER COUNTIES. IN

HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ENTRENCHED OVER MOST OF THE MID-SOUTH THIS
AFTERNOON. THE EXCEPTION IS ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA WHERE A PRE-FRONTAL / CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY IS
ADVANCING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD FROM SOUTHERN MISSOURI AND KENTUCKY.
EXPECT SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOUTHWARD
INTO NORTHERN COUNTIES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AND INTO
TONIGHT. ELSEWHERE...VERY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE
DEVELOPED AS A RESULT OF INTENSE HEATING AND ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE. THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD TEND TO DISSIPATE WITH
THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. VERY HOT TEMPERATURES AROUND 100
DEGREES IN MOST AREAS...COMBINED WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW 70S WILL
KEEP HEAT INDICES BETWEEN 105-110 DEGREES THIS EVENING.

THE BOUNDARY STRETCHED JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS
AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY PUSH SOUTHWARD THIS EVENING. AS
THIS OCCURS EXPECT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO
CONTINUE ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.
THERMODYNAMIC PARAMETERS (CAPES 2500-3000 J/KG / LI -2 TO -4)
SUGGEST THAT THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP OVER NORTHERN COUNTIES THIS
EVENING MAY BECOME PULSE SEVERE...WITH ISOLATED DAMAGING WIND GUSTS
BEING THE PRIMARY THREAT. ANY SEVERE THREAT WILL DIMINISH LATER
THIS EVENING WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. WIDESPREAD SEVERE
WEATHER IS NOT ANTICIPATED AT THIS POINT...AS ENVIRONMENTAL WINDS
(FROM REGIONAL PROFILERS) ARE NOT VERY STRONG AND SHEAR PROFILES
REMAIN WEAK.

ON SUNDAY...THE PRE-FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD SINK FURTHER SOUTH
ACROSS OUR AREA AS THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES TODAY
BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED OVER THE EASTERN STATES AS UPPER RIDGING
BUILDS OUT WEST. THIS PRE-FRONTAL BOUNDARY...ALONG WITH CONVECTIVE
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL COMBINE WITH SURFACE HEATING...LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE...AND AN UNCAPPED ATMOSPHERE TO TRIGGER SCATTERED SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS AREAWIDE. THE BEST CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...CLOSEST TO THE PRE-FRONTAL
BOUNDARY. AS FOR TEMPERATURES...THEY WILL ONCE AGAIN BE HOT...
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE REGION...WHERE CONVECTIVE
COVERAGE WILL BE LESS TO DISRUPT HEATING. THINK THAT HEAT AND
HUMIDITY COMBINATIONS WILL ALLOW HEAT INDICES TO EXCEED 105 DEGREES
ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS AND WILL LET EXTENDED HEAT ADVISORY CONTINUE
OVER THESE AREAS THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING. FURTHER NORTH...ENOUGH
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY AND CONVECTIVE CLOUD COVER SHOULD KEEP HEAT
INDICES BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA.

THE SYNOPTIC COLD FRONT...WITH COOLER AND MUCH LOWER HUMIDITY
LEVELS IS CURRENTLY STRETCHED ACROSS THE MIDWEST AND CENTRAL PLAINS
STATES THIS AFTERNOON WILL EVENTUALLY MOVE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. OPERATIONAL MODELS HAVE SLOWED THE
MOVEMENT OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY DOWN AND LOOKING AT CURRENT UPPER
AIR DATA...TEND TO AGREE WITH THE SLOW DOWN. HAVE ADDED POPS IN FOR
SUNDAY NIGHT AREAWIDE AND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE REGION ON
MONDAY.

CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD SOUTH INTO THE REGION FOR TUESDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY WITH DRY WEATHER...COOLER TEMPERATURES...AND MUCH
LOWER HUMIDITIES. THIS HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SLIDE EAST BY THE
END OF THE WEEK ALLOWING FOR MODERATING TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITY
LEVELS. AN UPPER RIDGE WILL ALSO BUILD BY MID WEEK BUT BEGIN TO
AGAIN BREAK DOWN BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK AND WEEKEND. THIS WILL
ALLOW FOR ISOLATED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO AGAIN
RETURN FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

HIGH PRESSURE ONCE AGAIN IN CONTROL OF THE MID-SOUTHS WEATHER THIS
MORNING. TEMPERATURES ARE QUICKLY WARMING TO NEAR OR ABOVE 90
DEGREES AS OF 15Z...AND ANOTHER HOT AND HUMID DAY IS IN STORE FOR
THE ENTIRE AREA. PLAN TO KEEP HEAT ADVISORY IN PLACE ACROSS THE
ENTIRE AREA TODAY...AS HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 90S TO AROUND
100 COMBINED WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 70S WILL AGAIN SUPPORT HEAT
INDICES BETWEEN 105 AND 110 DEGREES.

AS FOR THUNDERSTORM CHANCES...A WEAKENING CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW
BOUNDARY FROM OVERNIGHT STORMS IN MISSOURI IS CURRENTLY MOVING
SOUTHWARD ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND NORTHWEST TENNESSEE. IT
APPEARS THAT THE BOUNDARY HAS WEAKENED SIGNIFICANTLY AS IT
CONTINUES TO MOVE UNDER THE UPPER RIDGE...AND EARLIER STRATOCU
ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOUNDARY HAS FIZZLED. THINK THAT ALTHOUGH
SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE UPPER RIDGE IS WEAK...THAT THE BOUNDARY WILL
BE DISSIPATED AND LACK THE ABILITY TO FORCE ANY ADDITIONAL
CONVECTION.

THINK THAT THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL BE POSSIBLE LATER TODAY
ACROSS NORTHERN ZONES...AS SUBSIDENCE AND ASSOCIATED CAPPING IS
WEAK AND ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORM OUTFLOWS FROM ONGOING CONVECTION
ACROSS SOUTHWEST MISSOURI PUSHES SOUTHEAST INTO THESE AREAS. PLAN
TO LEAVE CURRENT SLIGHT CHANCE/LOW END CHANCE POPS (20%-30%) IN
PLACE FOR NOW. ELSEWHERE...ALTHOUGH REGIONAL 12Z SOUNDINGS SHOW
LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ATMOSPHERIC CAPPING...THERE WILL BE NO
SIGNIFICANT FEATURES TO FORCE CONVECTION. THEREFORE THUNDERSTORM
CHANCES WILL BE VERY LOW (<15% CHANCES).

ALTHOUGH CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS IN GOOD SHAPE...WILL DO A QUICK
UPDATE TO REMOVE FALLING TEMPERATURE WORDING FROM CURRENT ZONES.
UPDATE OUT SHORTLY.

HOT AND VERY UNCOMFORTABLE WEATHER CONTINUES ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH
AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES AREAWIDE ARE IN THE UPPER 90S
WITH SOME PLACES NEARING 100 DEGREES AT THIS HOUR. WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED TO SEE A FEW LOCATIONS MAINLY ALONG OR WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER EXCEEDING THE CENTURY MARK. HEAT INDICES WILL
CONTINUE TO RANGE BETWEEN 105 AND 110 DEGREES INTO THIS EVENING. VERY
ISOLATED SHOWERS (<20% COVERAGE) HAVE DEVELOPED OVER AREAS SOUTH OF
TUPELO...WHERE DEEPER MOISTURE EXISTS...BUT HIGH PRESSURE IS
SUPPRESSING THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOST ACTIVITY. EXPECT HOT AND HUMID
CONDITIONS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THIS EVENING.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. WILL SLOWLY MOVE SOUTH
INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH SATURDAY AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING
DOMINATES OVER THE AREA. THIS WILL LEAD TO ONE MORE HOT AND HUMID
DAY OVER THE MID-SOUTH ON SATURDAY...WITH A 595 UPPER HIGH OVERHEAD
AND 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 22C AREAWIDE. THIS MEANS HIGH
TEMPERATURES WILL ONCE AGAIN REACH INTO THE MID TO UPPER 90S. THIS
COMBINED WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S...WILL ALLOW HEAT
INDICES TO ONCE AGAIN RANGE BETWEEN 105 AND 110 DEGREES...WHICH
JUSTIFIES KEEPING THE HEAT ADVISORY IN PLACE THROUGH SATURDAY
AREAWIDE.

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVING INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES THIS
AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. A
SHORTWAVE IMPULSE WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST OUT OF CANADA...ACROSS THE
GREAT LAKES REGION AND INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC REGION THROUGH SUNDAY...
HELPING THE UPPER FLOW TO AMPLIFY AND THE UPPER TROUGH TO DIG ACROSS
THE EASTERN STATES. AS THE UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES...THE UPPER FLOW
OVER OUR AREA WILL PROGRESSIVELY BECOME NORTHWESTERLY AND PUSH A
STRONG COLD FRONT ACROSS OUR AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. JUST
ENOUGH DEEP MOISTURE IS EXPECTED ALONG THE FRONT TO PRODUCE
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS IT MOVES THROUGH. ALTHOUGH
WITH WEAK SURFACE CONVERGENCE AND MOST OF THE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT
REMAINING TO OUR NORTH...DO NOT EXPECT WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORM
COVERAGE. HAVE ADDED 20%-30% POPS AREAWIDE TO ACCOUNT FOR ACTIVITY
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
SUNDAY.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW BEHIND THE FRONT FOR SUNDAY NIGHT
INTO NEXT WEEK...USHERING IN COOLER TEMPERATURES AND MUCH LOWER
HUMIDITY LEVELS. VERY PLEASANT WEATHER WILL PERSIST FOR MONDAY
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WITH SOME MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES AND
HUMIDITY LEVELS BY THE END OF NEXT WEEK AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
SLIDES EAST. THE BAD NEWS WILL BE THE CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A WORSENING AND
EXPANSION OF THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS THAT CONTINUE TO PLAGUE
PORTIONS OF THE AREA.

HIGH PRESSURE BOTH AT THE SURFACE AND UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE
OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM 15Z
SHOWING TEMPERATURES ALREADY NEARING OR AT 90 DEGREES ALONG WITH
DEWPOINTS RUNNING IN THE LOW TO MID 70S. IN ADDITION...HEAT INDICES
ALREADY IN THE UPPER 90S TO NEAR 100. THE PRIMARY QUESTIONS FOR
THIS AFTERNOONS FORECAST IS HOW HIGH WILL TEMPERATURES AND HEAT
INDICES GET AND WHERE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP?

AS FOR THE HEAT...THINK THAT SINCE TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS WERE
HIGH ENOUGH YESTERDAY TO REACH ADVISORY CRITERIA...THAT WITH
TEMPERATURES RUNNING A FEW DEGREES HIGHER THAN AT THIS POINT
YESTERDAY AND WITH SIMILAR DEWPOINTS...SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEMS
REACHING HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA AT MOST LOCATIONS.

AS FOR THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL...BELIEVE THAT THE BEST CHANCES...AND
ISOLATED COVERAGE AT BEST...WILL BE ACROSS EXTREME NORTHERN AND
EXTREME SOUTHERN COUNTIES IN THE FORECAST AREA. FOR NORTHERN AREAS...
THERE IS AN OLD CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY (AS ANALYZED BY REGIONAL
VISIBLE SATELLITE AND KPAH RADAR) STRETCHED ACROSS SOUTHERN
KENTUCKY AND MISSOURI. THIS BOUNDARY COMBINED WITH CONTINUED DAYTIME
HEATING AND SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY LEAD TO ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT LATER TODAY. FOR SOUTHERN AREAS...THERE
APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY DEEPER MOISTURE IN PLACE AS NOTED FROM WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY. THIS COMBINED WITH DAYTIME HEATING MAY ALSO LEAD TO
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. ALL CHANCES FOR
THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN AT OR BELOW 20% ACROSS THESE AREAS...SO
NOT EXPECTING MUCH RELIEF FROM THE HEAT...EVEN IN AREAS THAT GET
THUNDER.

HAVE UPDATED THE GRIDS AND ZONES TO REFLECT CURRENT THINKING.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 344 PM...

A VERY HOT AFTERNOON CONTINUES WITH TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM THE
MID TO UPPER 90S AREAWIDE...EXCEPT FOR THOSE ISOLATED AREAS WITH
THUNDERSTORMS. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE CONFINED TO
EASTERN AREAS THIS AFTERNOON WHERE ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE IS DEEPER.
THESE STORMS ARE BEING DRIVEN BY THE DEEPER MOISTURE AND DAYTIME
HEATING AND MAY LINGER INTO THIS EVENING OVER THESE AREAS BEFORE
DISSIPATING AFTER SUNSET. SKIES SHOULD CLEAR OUT LATER THIS EVENING
WITH UNCOMFORTABLE TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITY LEVELS CONTINUING
THROUGH THE NIGHT.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ANCHORED OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S.
THROUGH SATURDAY AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BUILDS AND PERSISTS OVER
THE REGION. THIS RIDGING SHOULD HELP TO CAP THE ATMOSPHERE
AND CONTINUE DRYING OUT THE ATMOSPHERE IN THE MID LEVELS. THIS WILL
PREVENT MOST AFTERNOON CONVECTION BOTH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. LOW LEVEL
WINDS WILL REMAIN FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD
REMAIN IN PLACE...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S. VERY WARM 850
MB TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 20C AND 22C AREAWIDE WILL TRANSLATE TO
AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S. WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED TO SEE A FEW AREAS TOP THE CENTURY MARK...ESPECIALLY AREAS
ALONG AND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. WITH THESE HOT TEMPERATURES
COMBINED WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS...FELT IT PRUDENT TO ISSUE A HEAT
ADVISORY AREAWIDE THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING. HEAT INDICES SHOULD RANGE
BETWEEN 105 AND 110 DEGREES ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND AROUND 105 ON
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. SO ALL IN ALL...A VERY HOT END TO THE WEEK AND
FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND.

THE HOT WEATHER WILL COME TO AN END SATURDAY NIGHT AS AN UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH CURRENTLY NOTED OVER THE NORTHERN ROCKIES DIGS EAST
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF
THE U.S. THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL HELP TO SEND A STRONG COLD
FRONT SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.
DEEP MOISTURE APPEARS LIMITED IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT...BUT ISOLATED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE RIGHT ALONG THE FRONT SAT.
NIGHT ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA AND ON SUN. ACROSS NORTH
MISSISSIPPI.

BEHIND THE FRONT FOR LATER ON SUNDAY INTO THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT
WEEK...EXPECT A COOLER AND MUCH LESS HUMID AIRMASS TO ADVECT INTO
THE REGION. THIS WILL BRING A REFRESHING CHANGE FROM THE HOT WEATHER
PATTERN OF LATE...ALTHOUGH MORE DRY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE
THROUGH THIS PERIOD WHICH IS BAD NEWS FOR THE WORSENING DROUGHT
CONDITIONS CONTINUING TO EXPAND ACROSS THE AREA. SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE AREA EARLY NEXT WEEK BEFORE
SLOWLY MOVING EAST BY WEDNESDAY AND ALLOWING FOR A MODERATION IN
TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITY LEVELS FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY OF NEXT

THE WEAKENING STATIONARY BOUNDARY THAT WAVERED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH
YESTERDAY HAS MOVED TO OUR NORTH AND DISSIPATED. A WEAK SHORTWAVE
TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THIS MORNING TRIGGERED CONVECTION OVER NORTHERN

SURFACE FRONT THAT HAD PROVIDED BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN HAS LIFTED

OVER THE REGION. WATER VAPOR STILL SHOWS FAIR AMOUNT OF DEEPER 
MOISTURE OVER THE AREA BUT DRIER MID LEVEL AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
UPPER RIDGE IS GRADUALLY MOVING TOWARDS THE AREA.

SCATTERED AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE POSSIBLE TODAY. 
THESE STORMS SHOULD BE LESS NUMEROUS WITH THE FRONT OUT OF THE AREA. 
A WEAK NORTH/SOUTH ORIENTED SHORTWAVE THAT IS CURRENTLY OVER 
OKLAHOMA WILL ARRIVE INTO THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON. THIS COULD HELP 
FOCUS THUNDERSTORMS. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE SLIGHTLY BETTER WEST OF 
THE MS RIVER THIS AFTERNOON SINCE THE DEEPER MOISTURE WILL BE 
LINGERING THERE. SEVERE PARAMETERS ONCE AGAIN NOT SUPPORTIVE OF 
SEVERE WEATHER OR AT LEAST WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER. UPPER RIDGE 
AND ASSOCIATED DRY 850-500MB AIR ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY SHOULD KEEP 
THE AREA MAINLY DRY. 850 TEMPS WILL SLOWLY BE RISING OVER THE NEXT 
24 HOURS.  TEMPS SHOULD BE IN THE LOW TO MID 90S TODAY. BORDERLINE 
HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA TODAY INTO SATURDAY. HEAT INDICIES WILL BE 
OVER 100 AND BE FLIRTING WITH 105 DURING THE AFTERNOON. WILL LARGELY 
DEPEND UPON HOW MUCH THE ATMOSPHERE MIXES DOWN DURING THE AFTERNOON. 
WITH THE EXPECTED HIGHS...WOULD HAVE TO HOLD 73 DEGREE DEW POINTS 
THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MID AND UPPER 90S LIKELY FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...ONLY NEED TO HOLD 71 DEGREE DEW POINTS TO REACH HEAT 
ADVISORY CRITERIA OF 105.

GFS AND NAM CONTINUE TO SPEED UP THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT. 
NOW LOOKS LIKE LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND 
THE BOOTHEEL...SATURDAY NIGHT ELSEWHERE. DEEP MOISTURE ALONG THE 
FRONT IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE ON THE MODELS SO DO NOT EXPECT THERE TO 
BE MUCH COVERAGE WITH THE FRONT. THE MORE NOTICEABLE IMPACT OF THIS 
FRONT WILL BE THE TEMPS. THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW A GREATER 
AMPLIFICATION OF THE WESTERN RIDGE AND A RESULTING DEEPENING OF THE 
EASTERN TROUGH THAT THE MIDSOUTH WILL BE ON THE EDGE OF. IF THIS 
PANS OUT...THERE WILL ONLY BE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER 
NORTH MS AS THE FRONT CLEARS THE REGION AND DIVES TOWARDS THE GULF 
COAST. SUNDAY WILL BE SLIGHTLY COOLER BUT LOWER DEW POINTS WILL BE 
ADVECTING INTO THE REGION. COULD HAVE A TASTE OF FALL EARLY TO MID 
NEXT WEEK WITH MEX GUIDANCE SHOWING HIGHS IN THE 80S AREAWIDE...LOWS 
IN THE LOW AND MID 60S AND DEW POINTS IN THE LOWER 60S. NO OTHER 
RAIN CHANCES IN THE EXTENDED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH PREVAILING AND

OVER 100 AND BE FLIRTING WITH 105 DURING THE AFTERNOON. WILL LARGELY 
DEPEND UPON HOW MUCH THE ATMOSPHERE MIXES DOWN DURING THE AFTERNOON. 
WITH THE EXPECTED HIGHS...WOULD HAVE TO HOLD 73 DEGREE DEW POINTS 
THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MID AND UPPER 90S LIKELY FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...ONLY NEED TO HOLD 71 DEGREE DEW POINTS TO REACH HEAT 
ADVISORY CRITERIA OF 105.

GFS AND NAM CONTINUE TO SPEED UP THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT. 
NOW LOOKS LIKE LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND 
THE BOOTHEEL...SATURDAY NIGHT ELSEWHERE. DEEP MOISTURE ALONG THE 
FRONT IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE ON THE MODELS SO DO NOT EXPECT THERE TO 
BE MUCH COVERAGE WITH THE FRONT. THE MORE NOTICEABLE IMPACT OF THIS 
FRONT WILL BE THE TEMPS. THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW A GREATER 
AMPLIFICATION OF THE WESTERN RIDGE AND A RESULTING DEEPENING OF THE 
EASTERN TROUGH THAT THE MIDSOUTH WILL BE ON THE EDGE OF. IF THIS 
PANS OUT...THERE WILL ONLY BE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER 
NORTH MS AS THE FRONT CLEARS THE REGION AND DIVES TOWARDS THE GULF 
COAST. SUNDAY WILL BE SLIGHTLY COOLER BUT LOWER DEW POINTS WILL BE 
ADVECTING INTO THE REGION. COULD HAVE A TASTE OF FALL EARLY TO MID 
NEXT WEEK WITH MEX GUIDANCE SHOWING HIGHS IN THE 80S AREAWIDE...LOWS 
IN THE LOW AND MID 60S AND DEW POINTS IN THE LOWER 60S. NO OTHER 
RAIN CHANCES IN THE EXTENDED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH PREVAILING AND 
PREVENTING ANY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS FROM IMPACTING THE REGION.

SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL AND NORTHWEST ARKANSAS THIS
MORNING...MOVING TOWARD NORTHWEST SECTIONS OF OUR AREA. THERE HAVE
BEEN FEW...IF ANY...LIGHTNING STRIKES IN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING.

OBSERVATIONS DO NOT GIVE A CLEAR INDICATION OF WHERE FRONT IS
LOCATED THIS MORNING. SUSPECT IT IS NEAR...OR JUST NORTH OF MEMPHIS.
CLOUD COVER MUCH MORE EXTENSIVE NORTH OF INTERSTATE 40...AND THAT
IS WHERE ALL THE PRECIPITATION IS LOCATED. BOUNDARY EXPECTED TO MOVE
NORTHWARD THROUGH THURSDAY.

QUESTION OF THE DAY IS WHETHER CLOUD COVER OVER NORTHERN HALF OF CWA
WILL BREAK UP. SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS SOUTHERN HALF OF CWA. THAT IS ALREADY ACCOUNTED FOR IN
FORECAST. IF CLOUD COVER REMAINS OVER NORTH...THAT AREA SHOULD JUST
SEE SHOWERS. CLOUD COVER WILL ALSO DETERMINE HIGH TEMPERATURE
FORECAST. FORECAST HIGHS IN NORTH MAY BE TOO WARM...AND TOO COOL IN
THE SOUTH. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR.

AN ILL-DEFINED STATIONARY FRONT IS ORIENTED EAST-WEST ACROSS THE 
REGION. VERY DIFFICULT TO PLACE THE FRONT EXACTLY DUE TO THE 
NUMEROUS SURFACE TROUGHS THAT ARE PRESENT AHEAD OF THE FRONT. RADAR 
HAS SHOWN A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS POP UP ACROSS NORTHWEST MS THIS 
MORNING PROBABLY IN RESPONSE TO A WEAK DISTURBANCE WORKING ITS WAY 
ALONG THE FRONT. 

BOTH GFS AND NAM SHOW THE FRONT LIFTING NORTHWARD THIS AFTERNOON TO 
BE NEARLY OUT OF THE AREA BY 00Z. A GOOD DEAL OF 850-500MB MOISTURE 
PERSISTS ACROSS THE REGION. EXPECT CONVECTION ALL DAY AS MINOR 
DISTURBANCES MOVE THEIR WAY ALONG THE FRONT. CONVECTION SHOULD 
BECOME MORE PREVALENT THIS AFTERNOON AS DIURNAL HEATING BECOMES A 
FACTOR. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ANY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS MOVING 
ACROSS THE AREA SO EXPECT CONVECTION TO REMAIN SCATTERED. 
INSTABILITY IS SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY SO NOT EXPECTING ANY OF THESE 
STORMS TO BECOME DAMAGING TODAY. HAVE FORECASTED HIGHS TO BE WARMER 
THAN MAV WITH CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO BE PARTLY SUNNY THROUGH THE 
MORNING. A FEW MORE CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON COMBINED AND COOLER 850 
TEMPS OF AROUND +18 SHOULD TRANSLATE INTO TEMPS THAT ARE ABOUT 3 OR 
4 DEGREES COOLER THAN YESTERDAY.

CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH THIS EVENING DUE TO THE LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING. WITH THE FRONT EXPECTED TO BE WELL NORTH OF THE 
AREA...CONVECTION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO THE EVENING HOURS. 850-500MB 
MOISTURE LOOKS PRETTY DESCENT ON THURSDAY STILL SO EXPECT SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS TO REDEVELOP IN THE AFTERNOON. TEMPS WILL BE GRADUALLY 
INCREASING OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AS WINDS TURN TOWARDS THE SOUTH 
AND SOUTHWEST AND THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS BACK OVER THE AREA.

DRIER AIR WILL BE WORKING IN WITH THE RIDGE ON FRIDAY. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT THE ONLY PLACE WHERE 850-500MB MOISTURE WILL BE DEEP 
ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY EVEN SLIGHT CHANCES OF AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE ACROSS NORTH MS. DRY AIR WORKS IN ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION 
ON SATURDAY SO RAIN CHANCES LOOK PRETTY LOW. WITH 850 TEMPS ABOVE 
+20...LOOKS LIKE HIGHS WILL BE IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S AREAWIDE 
AGAIN.

ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL ARRIVE SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. DEEP 
MOISTURE IS FAIRLY LIMITED ALONG THE FRONT SO ONLY EXPECT SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE FRONT. THE GFS SHOWS THE FRONT 
MAKING IT WELL SOUTH OF THE AREA AND THERE IS SOME COOLER AIR BEHIND 
THE FRONT. ENOUGH TO COOL MUCH OF THE AREA INTO THE 80S FOR HIGHS. 
THIS SOLUTION LOOKS REASONABLE WITH THE GFS SHOWING IN THE UPPER AIR 
PATTERN THAT THE RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN US WILL BE AMPLIFIED WITH A 
PROGRESSIVE TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE EASTERN US.

QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARY ACROSS SOUTHERN MISSOURI AND WESTERN 
KENTUCKY. 88D REGIONAL RADAR TRENDS SHOW SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OCCURRING ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
MOSTLY ISOLATED CONVECTION NORTH AND SOUTH. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS 
THIS PACKAGE IS PRECIPITATION CHANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BOUNDARY.

SHORTWAVE IN WEAK ZONAL FLOW WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT 
WITH SURFACE BOUNDARY POSSIBLY MOVING AS FAR SOUTH AS THE 
TENNESSEE/MISSISSIPPI STATE LINE. BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS THIS 
AFTERNOON WILL GO WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE FIRST 
HALF OF THE NIGHT...AND LIKELY POPS TO THE NORTH OVERNIGHT AS MCV 
OVER OKLAHOMA MOVES ALONG THE FRONT. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 
AROUND 2 INCHES AND WEAK WINDS ALOFT WILL SUPPORT HEAVY RAINFALL 
WITH ANY SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS.  

QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARY WILL THEN START TO RETREAT BACK NORTH 
AGAIN AS A WARM FRONT WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. AS A 
RESULT...WENT WITH SCATTERED POPS THROUGH THURSDAY AND TAPERED POPS 
TO SLIGHT CHANCE AS BOUNDARY MOVES FURTHER NORTH ACROSS THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.  

LONG RANGE...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...SOME MINOR MODEL 
DISAGREEMENTS BY THE END OF THE LONG RANGE WITH THE HANDLING OF THE

BOUNDARIES PRESENT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH FROM YESTERDAY/S CONVECTION. 
VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS MOSTLY MID/HIGH CLOUDS NORTH OF 
TENNESSEE/MISSISSIPPI STATE LINE UP TOWARDS THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL. 
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THIS AFTERNOON IS CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL. 

MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW AT LEAST 3000 J/KG SURFACE BASED CAPE...LI/S 
AROUND -5...AND PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 2 INCHES IN AREAS 
WHICH RECEIVE SOME SUNSHINE. IN ADDITION...WEAK UPPER LEVEL WINDS 
SUGGEST PULSE SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE THE PRIMARY MODE OF 
CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY ACROSS POINTS ALONG AND SOUTH OF I-40. 

WILL ISSUE AN UPDATE TO ADJUST TIMING OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS AND 
BUMP THE REST OF THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA UP TO 
LIKELY POPS DUE TO VICINITY OF THE FRONT AND CONVECTIVE TRENDS. WILL 
ALSO ADJUST TEMPERATURES DOWN SLIGHTLY ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS 
WHERE CLOUD COVER WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM ANTICIPATED HIGHS.

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY. 

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 325 AM CDT TUE AUG 16 2005...

A WEAK UPPER AIR DISTURBANCE IS MOVING OVER THE REGION AS OF 08Z. 
THE RESULT HAS BEEN A FEW SCATTERED LIGHT THUNDERSHOWERS ACROSS 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...NORTHWEST TENNESSEE AND THE BOOTHEEL. THE 
STATIONARY FRONT ALTHOUGH ILL-DEFINED DUE TO THE LIGHT WINDS AND 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MOST LIKELY RUNS FROM KENTUCKY ACROSS SOUTHERN 
MISSOURI AND INTO EASTERN OKLAHOMA. A BULLSEYE OF UPPER LEVEL 
POSITIVE VORTICITY IS PRESENT OVER NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA. 

THE 00Z NAM AND GFS ARE IN DESCENT AGREEMENT TO AROUND 42 HOURS. AN 
UPPER SHORTWAVE OVER THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL TRANSLATE 
EASTWARD TODAY. AS IT DOES SO...IT WILL GRADUALLY TURN THE STEERING 
FLOW ACROSS THE REGION TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. 
THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE FRONT TO SAG SOUTHWARD INTO THE REGION. 
MODELS SHOW CONVECTION FIRING LATE THIS MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON 
ALONG THE FRONT IN NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AS THE ATMOSPHERE BEGINS TO 
HEAT UP AND THE VORT MAX OVER NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA MOVES TOWARDS THE 
EAST NORTHEAST. THE MODELS...ESPECIALLY THE ETA...MAY BE TOO FAST IN 
BRINGING THE FRONT THROUGH THE AREA. THIS IS PROBABLY BECAUSE THEY 
ARE PICKING UP ON THE AFTERNOON CONVECTION. BY 00Z...EXPECT THE 
FRONT TO EXTEND FROM NEAR JONESBORO THROUGH DYERSBURG AND PARIS. 
ANTICIPATE THAT CONVECTION WILL REMAIN NEAR THE FRONT ZONE AND BE 
MORE NUMEROUS OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS CLOSER TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE 
VORT MAX. UNCERTAIN AS TO WHAT THE AREAL COVERAGE WILL BE OVER 
NORTHWEST TN SINCE IT IS UNCLEAR IF THE STORMS WILL ORGANIZE INTO A 
LINE OR NOT. BASED UPON THE AMOUNT OF HEATING THAT OCCURRED 
YESTERDAY MORNING AND LOOKING AT A SIMILAR SITUATION THIS 
MORNING...EXPECT HIGHS TO BE WARMER THAN GUIDANCE. LIKELY CLOSE TO 
YESTERDAYS HIGHS EXCEPT IN THE VICINITY OF THE FRONTAL ZONE WHERE 
AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD RESULT IN SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS THAN 
YESTERDAY. WITH TEMPS IN THE LOWER 90S...CAPES ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
GREATER THAN 3000 J/KG AND LIS AROUND -5. ALTHOUGH UPPER LEVEL WINDS 
ARE PATHETIC AND SHEAR IS VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT CANT ENTIRELY RULE 
THE POSSIBILITY OF A LOCALIZED DOWNBURST IF A STORM OR TWO WERE TO 
BECOME REALLY HEALTHY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE IN EXCESS OF 2 
INCHES WHILE STORM MOTION IS APPROXIMATELY 11KTS. SO THE STORMS 
SHOULD MOVE BUT THEY COULD HAVE SOME IMPRESSIVE RAINFALL RATES. 

EXPECT THE FRONT TO CONTINUE TO SLIP FURTHER INTO THE REGION 
TONIGHT...POSSIBLY MAKING IT THROUGH MEMPHIS. AREAL COVERAGE 
SHOULD DIMINISH WITH THE LOSS OF DIURNAL INSTABILITY. THE FRONT WILL 
REMAIN STALLED ACROSS THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY WITH BEST CHANCES FOR 
RAIN IN THE VICINITY OF THE FRONT. GFS SHOWS A GOOD VORT MAX MOVING 
INTO THE REGION WHILE THE ETA DOES NOT SHOW THIS. EXPECT CONVECTION 
TO BE AROUND REGARDLESS DUE TO DIURNAL INSTABILITY AND THE PRESENCE 
OF THE FRONT...JUST UNCERTAIN IF AREAL COVERAGE WILL REMAIN 
SCATTERED OR WIDESPREAD. 

THE ETA LIFTS THE FRONT BACK NORTHWARD ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHILE THE 
GFS HOLDS OFF UNTIL THURSDAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING 
ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST ON THURSDAY. THE CIRCULATION AROUND THE LOW 
SHOULD INDEED LIFT THE FRONT NORTHWARD. AT THIS POINT...THE GFS IS A 
LITTLE MORE BELIEVABLE SINCE THE ETA LOOKS WAY TOO FAST GIVEN THE 
TIME OF YEAR AND THE WIND SPEEDS ALOFT. CONVECTION WILL ONCE AGAIN 
BE AROUND ESPECIALLY IN THE VICINITY OF THE FRONT ON THURSDAY. 
HIGHER POPS FROM THE TN/MS BORDER SOUTHWARD AS A RESULT. CONVECTION 
SHOULD SUBSIDE WITH THE SETTING SUN ON THURSDAY NIGHT WITH NO 
SIGNIFICANT VORT MAXS TO ENHANCE CONVECTION. STILL LOOKS HOT WITH 
850 TEMPS HOLDING AT +20 AT LEAST.

FRONT SHOULD BE NORTH OF THE REGION BY FRIDAY WITH ISOLATED HEAT OF 
THE DAY VARIETY THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY GOING INTO THE WEEKEND. ANOTHER 
FRONT WILL ARRIVE TOWARDS THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEKEND ALTHOUGH 
THE 850-500MB MOISTURE DOES NOT LOOK ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE. EXPECT 
COVERAGE TO REMAIN SCATTERED AS THE FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA ON 
SUNDAY. NOT CERTAIN IF THE FRONT WILL ACTUALLY MOVE THROUGH THE AREA 
AS EARLIER FORECASTS HAD SUGGESTED. GFS THIS MORNING SHOWS A WAVE 
DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT AND MOVING ACROSS THE REGION TOWARDS 
MIDWEEK. NOT SURE IF THIS IS REAL OR CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK. AS A 
RESULT...ESSENTIALLY FORECASTED CLIMATOLOGY FOR DAYS 6 AND 7.

MB SHORTWAVE MOVING FROM NE OK INTO NW AR/SW MO. THIS FEATURE WAS 
HELPING TO PRODUCE TSTMS ACRS NRN/N CNTRL AR THIS EVENING. AS THIS 
SHORTWAVE MOVES ACRS THE AR/MO BORDER EXPECT TSTMS TO CONT INTO THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH THE BEST CHANCE ACRS NE AR/MO BOOTHEEL AND NW 
TN...GENERALLY N OF I-40. PLACES SOUTH OF I-40 WL PROBABLY REMAIN 
DRY. THOUGH SEVERE WX THREAT APPEARS TO HAVE DIMINISHED WITH LOSS OF 
SFC HEATING AN ISOLD SEVERE STORM IS STILL POSSIBLE. WL ADJUST POPS 
A BIT OTRW FORECAST LOOKS GOOD.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 331 PM...

SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED THIS AFTERNOON FROM WEST TN
INTO NORTH MS...DESPITE STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGING ACROSS MOST OF
THE MIDSOUTH. THESE THUNDERSTORMS APPARENTLY DEVELOPED ALONG AN
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM EARLIER CONVECTION. A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT
REMAINS NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH FROM NORTHEAST OK ACROSS SOUTHERN MO
INTO SOUTHERN IL. A SHORT WAVE WILL OVERRIDE THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE
AND MOVE ACROSS SOUTHERN MO TONIGHT. LAPS INDICATES CAPES BETWEEN
2000 AND 3000 J/KG ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. THUS THINK ADDITIONAL
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS
NORTHEAST AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SHORT WAVE...
POSSIBLY MOVING INTO WEST TN / NORTHWEST MS.

THE MIDSOUTH IS FORECAST TO BE IN A LITTLE WETTER PATTERN THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS. THE H5 RIDGE THAT COVERS THE MIDSOUTH THIS
AFTERNOON IS FORECAST TO SINK SOUTHWARD WITH HEIGHTS LOWERING
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL ALLOW THE FRONTAL ZONE TO OUR NORTH
TO SHIFT SOUTHWARD WITH ANY ASSOCIATED OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MAKING IT
FURTHER SOUTHWARD INTO THE MIDSOUTH. WARM...MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR
AHEAD OF THE FRONT / OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL ALLOW FOR THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW
DEGREES LESS HOT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
MIDSOUTH...DUE TO THE INCREASED CONVECTION.

A H5 RIDGE IS FORECAST TO ONCE AGAIN STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. THE RESULT WILL BE A RETURN TO A SMALL CHANCE
OF MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.

THE GFS INDICATES A FAIRLY GOOD COLD FRONT FOR THIS TIME OF THE
YEAR COMING THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH LATE IN THE WEEKEND OR EARLY NEXT
WEEK...AS THE RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AND A UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVES TO
OUR NORTH. MANY TIMES THE GFS OVER AMPLIFIES THE TROUGHS IN
THESE SITUATIONS PUSHING THE COLD FRONT THROUGH TOO FAST AND TOO
STRONG. AS A RESULT...ATTM WILL GO WITH A SLOWER MOVEMENT OF THE
FRONT AND NOT AS STRONG...BUT WILL INDICATE A DRY FORECAST FOR
MONDAY FROM NORTHEAST AR INTO WEST TN.

WILL NEED TO UPDATE THE FORECAST FOR TODAY TO MAKE A NUMBER OF
CHANGES. 12Z UPPER AIR ANALYSES INDICATES THE RIDGE COVERING THE
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES IS STRONGER THAN FORECAST THIS MORNING.
THIS WILL ALLOW FOR MORE SUN ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH MAXIMUM
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE WARMER THAN FORECAST IN MOST LOCATIONS. WILL
NEED TO MONITOR HEAT INDICES WHICH WILL LIKELY APPROACH 105 DEGREES
IN SOME LOCATIONS. WILL ALSO LOWER POPS IN MOST LOCATIONS. THE
GREATEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHEAST AR INTO
THE MO BOOTHEEL...A WEAK UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVERRIDING THE RIDGE
WILL MOVE ACROSS SOUTHERN MO THIS AFTERNOON ENHANCING THE CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS IN THESE AREAS. A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDS
FROM NORTHEAST OK ACROSS SOUTHERN MO INTO SOUTHERN IL THIS MORNING.
AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM EARLIER THUNDERSTORMS IN ADVANCE OF THIS
FRONT EXTENDS FROM NORTHEAST AR INTO WEST TN. THIS BOUNDARY WILL ALSO
SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON.

SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. THE STATIONARY FRONTAL
BOUNDARY HAS LOST SOME OF ITS IDENTITY DUE TO THE ONGOING CONVECTION
OVER THE AREA. THE SHOWERS OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS HAVE SENT OUT
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES AS SEEN ON KNQA BASE REFLECTIVITY.

THE ATMOSPHERE OVER THE AREA WILL REMAIN MOIST AND UNSTABLE TODAY.
TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE AREA WILL RANGE FROM THE LOWER TO MID 90S
AND CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL REMAIN HIGHEST ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF

AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY IN THE UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE. MAIN FORECAST 
CONCERN IS PRECIPITATION CHANCES IN THIS PACKAGE WHICH DEPENDS ON 
PLACEMENT OF THE MEANDERING STATIONARY FRONT. 

TONIGHT...QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS SOUTHEAST MISSOURI WILL 
BEGIN TO MOVE AS FAR SOUTH AS THE NORTHERN/NORTHWESTERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA.  EXPECTING TO SEE CONVECTION DIMINISH WITH LOSS OF 
DAYTIME HEATING AND WILL KEEP ONGOING SCATTERED POPS.  

MONDAY...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE IN MID LEVEL SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE MIDDLE/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT 
/PARALLEL TO UPPER LEVEL FLOW/ WILL MEANDER AROUND THE 
REGION...POSSIBLY REACHING AS FAR SOUTH AS I-40. WEAK MID LEVEL 
FORCING WITH CAPES AROUND 2000-3000 J/KG...LI/S AROUND -7...AND 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 2 INCHES SUGGEST ANY CONVECTION 
THAT DEVELOPS WILL BE PULSE SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS AND MADE MINOR 
ADJUSTMENTS TO SCATTERED POPS. 

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT SHOULD MOVE NORTH AS 
A WARM FRONT THEN STALL OUT OVER MISSOURI AGAIN. MODEL PERFORMANCE 
POOR WITH RESOLVING STATIONARY FRONT...NAM PLACING FRONT AS FAR 
SOUTH AS THE GULF COAST AND GFS KEEPING THE FRONT ACROSS THE

LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO RAISE POPS A CATEGORY.

.DISCUSSION...14Z SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING PLACES STATIONARY 
FRONT FROM NEAR VANDALIA ILLINOIS WEST TO THE LAKE OF THE OZARKS 
WITH OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM PREVIOUS CONVECTION ACROSS SOUTHEAST 
MISSOURI. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THIS AFTERNOON IS PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES AND SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL. 

MODEL SOUNDINGS ACROSS THE AREA SHOW INSTABILITY VALUES AROUND 2000 
J/KG OR ABOVE...LI/S AROUND -6...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES NEAR 2 
INCHES. ALSO WEAK WIND FIELDS SUGGEST THAT ANY CONVECTION THAT FORMS 
WILL BE PULSE TYPE SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WITH WIND AS THE MAIN 
THREAT AS FREEZING LEVELS AROUND 15 KFT. AS MID LEVEL FORCING IS NOT 
THAT GREAT AND LITTLE IF ANY CONVECTION ON REGIONAL RADAR 
YET...CANNOT JUSTIFY RAISING POPS ABOVE SCATTERED AT THIS TIME. 
TEMPERATURES FOR THIS AFTERNOON ARE ON TRACK WITH TEMPERATURES 
ALREADY IN THE UPPER 80S IN MANY SPOTS. NO UPDATE IS ANTICIPATED AT 
THIS TIME.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 306 AM CDT SUN AUG 14 2005...

A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING WEATHER THIS MORNING. SO FAR THE UPPER 
RIDGE HAS KEPT THE MOISTURE AND CONVECTION WELL NORTH AND WEST 
TODAY. IT HAS ALSO PRODUCED SOME VERY WARM TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE 
REGION. HEAT INDEX VALUES AGAIN WILL APPROACH 105 DEGREES.

CONVECTION THAT FORMED ALONG THE FRONT IN SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI 
OVERNIGHT HAS SENT AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY INTO NORTHWESTERN TENNESSEE. 
THIS BOUNDARY WILL PROBABLY BE A FOCUS FOR SOME THUNDERSTORMS TO 
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THIS AREA. IN ADDITION...THE COLD 
FRONT WILL SLOWLY SAG INTO THE MID SOUTH. SOME STORMS THAT FORM THIS 
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE NORTHERN FORECAST AREA  COULD BE SEVERE AND 
PRODUCE WINDS IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH.

THE CHANGE IN THIS FORECAST...I.E. HIGHER CHANCES FOR RAIN IS COMING 
FROM THE FUTURE MOVEMENT OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND ANTICIPATED 
BOUNDARIES FORMED BY AFTERNOON CONVECTION. ALSO...THE NORTHERN EDGE 
OF THE UPPER RIDGE WILL MOVE A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH. THE AREA WILL 
BE SANDWICHED WITH THE MOISTURE SEEN ACROSS TEXAS...OKLAHOMA AND 
MISSOURI THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THUS HIGHER CHANCES FOR RAIN HAVE BEEN 
INCLUDED IN THE FORECAST AND MAY BE RAISED IN LATER SHIFTS AS THINGS 
BECOME BETTER DEFINED.

TN INTO NORTHEAST MS ALONG AND TO THE EAST OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH.
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WERE DEVELOPING IN THESE AREAS.
FOR TONIGHT...WILL HAVE 30 PERCENT POPS FROM ABOUT JACKSON TN
SOUTHWARD INTO NORTHEAST MS....20 PERCENT ELSEWHERE EXCEPT ONLY 10
PERCENT NORTHEAST AR AND MO BOOTHEEL. SKIES WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR
LATER THIS EVENING WITH THE THUNDERSTORMS ENDING...ALTHOUGH THE UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH MAY KEEP SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY IN PARTS OF NORTHEAST MS.

OVERALL...THE PATTERN REMAINS A HOT ONE WITH NO SIGNIFICANT RAIN
FOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS AS HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT DOMINATES WEATHER OVER THE
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. DRY AIR HAS MIXED DOWN ENOUGH TO KEEP
HEAT INDICES FROM REACHING THE CRITICAL LEVEL OF 105 DEGREES THE
PAST COUPLE OF DAYS...THINK THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE CASE OVER
THE WEEKEND...HOWEVER IT WILL BE CLOSE SO NEEDS TO BE MONITORED.
A COLD FRONT WILL COME CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE MIDSOUTH TO ENHANCE OUR
RAIN CHANCES BY MONDAY...MAINLY A RESULT OF MOISTURE FEEDING INTO THE
MIDSOUTH AHEAD OF THE FRONT. DO NOT THINK THE COLD FRONT WILL MAKE IT
INTO THE MIDSOUTH...AS MODELS INDICATE HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT ACTUALLY
BUILDING OVER THE MIDSOUTH EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE HIGH MOVES EASTWARD
AROUND THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK ALLOWING FOR SOME INCREASE IN
MOISTURE...AND CONTINUED SMALL CHANCES OF RAIN.

.DISCUSSION...
UPPER LOW ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF COAST IS HELPING TO INCREASE
MOISTURE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE SOUTHEAST. WATER VAPOR
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES MORE MOIST AIR AT THE MID AND UPPER
LEVELS GRADUALLY SHIFTING NORTHWARD INTO THE MIDSOUTH. A COUPLE OF
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ALREADY POPPED UP THIS MORNING ACROSS WEST TN
AND NORTH MS. CURRENT FORECAST OF 30 PERCENT POPS ACROSS NORTHEAST
MS AND 20 PERCENT ELSEWHERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON STILL LOOKS GOOD.
WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR HEAT INDEX VALUES THIS AFTERNOON...CURRENT
THINKING IS THAT THEY WILL REMAIN JUST BELOW THE CRITICAL THRESHOLD
OF 105 DEGREES. EXPECT SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL LOWER SOME THIS
AFTERNOON WITH MIXING ESPECIALLY FROM NORTHEAST AR INTO NORTHWEST TN
WHERE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS DRIER AIR ALOFT.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 200 AM CDT FRI AUG 12 2005

CONDITIONS WILL CHANGE LITTLE FROM THE PAST FEW DAYS AND WILL BE
DIFFICULT TO BEAT PERSISTENCE.

A WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREA WAS NOTED OVER THE GULF COAST OF ALABAMA
AND THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. THIS WAS A PLAYER IN SOME OF THE
CONVECTION THAT FORMED OVER THE MID SOUTH YESTERDAY AND WILL LIKELY
PLAY A ROLE IN ADDITIONAL CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. COVERAGE WILL
PROBABLY BE CONFINED TO NORTHEASTERN MISSISSIPPI WITH A FEW ISOLATED
STORMS DEVELOPING ACROSS PARTS OF WEST TENNESSEE AND THE REMAINDER
OF NORTH MISSISSIPPI. NORTHEASTERN MISSISSIPPI WILL HAVE SLIGHTLY
HIGHER INSTABILITY AND SOME WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE TO AID THE
CONVECTION TODAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL AGAIN TODAY
AND HEAT INDICES IN THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA WILL BE FROM 100 TO 105
DEGREES.

THE MID SOUTH WILL SEE SIMILAR CONDITIONS ON SATURDAY.

A VERY WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH THE MID SOUTH SATURDAY
AND HANG UP ACROSS CENTRAL MISSOURI. IT APPEARS THAT THE LATEST
MODELS SUPPORT THE FRONT SEEPING INTO THE NORTHWESTERN FORECAST AREA
ON MONDAY. RAIN CHANCES SLIGHTLY INCREASE ACROSS THE REGION AS
PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ENGULFS THE AREA.

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH NEXT WEEK.

A FEW THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FORMED FROM WEST TN INTO NORTH MS THIS
AFTERNOON WHERE LAPS INDICATES CAPES HAVE INCREASED TO BETWEEN 1500

THROUGH EARLY EVENING FOR THESE AREAS. THE THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD
QUICKLY DISSIPATE WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING LEAVING MOSTLY CLEAR

THE NEXT 7 DAYS LOOK MOSTLY HOT WITH THE CHANCE OF ANY SIGNIFICANT
RAIN SLIM. THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE COVERING THE MIDSOUTH WILL MOVE
EAST FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SOME INCREASE IN
MOISTURE ACROSS THE AREA RESULTING IN SMALL CHANCES FOR AFTERNOON

AR...THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL...AND NORTHWEST TN ON SUNDAY TO ENHANCE
THE CHANCE OF RAIN A LITTLE.

THE LATEST GFS INDICATES THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING BACK STRONG

BETTER INSTABILITY WILL BE ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND TRIMMED

WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE DIMINISHING CHANCES OF RAIN AS THE WEEK
PROGRESSES. HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WILL SLOWLY BUILD INTO THE AREA BY

SKIES HAVE CLEARED ACROSS MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS MORNING. AS A
RESULT...AREAS OF DENSE FOG HAVE FORMED WHERE IT RAINED YESTERDAY.
HAVE ISSUED A DENSE FOG ADVISORY FOR THE AREAS LISTED BELOW.

THE MIDSOUTH WILL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TODAY. LOW
PRESSURE ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL LIFT SLOWLY NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN HALF OF AL. MEANWHILE...AN ELONGATED WEST
TO EAST TROUGH WILL MOVE SOUTHWARD THROUGH EASTERN AR. THESE FEATURES
WILL COMBINE WITH ABUNDANT MOISTURE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TO PRODUCE
THE THUNDERSTORMS. SPC INDICATES A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE FOR THE
ENTIRE MIDSOUTH TODAY...SIMILAR TO THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WITH HIGH
WINDS BEING THE MAIN THREAT...AND POSSIBLY SOME LARGE HAIL. THE
NAM INDICATES THE HIGHEST CAPES THIS AFTERNOON ALONG THE MS RIVER
WESTWARD ACROSS EASTERN AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL. THINK WE WILL
RECEIVE A DECENT AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE TO HELP BOOST MAXIMUM
TEMPERATURES INTO THE LOWER 90S.

OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS THE LOW OVER SOUTHERN ALABAMA WILL MOVE
GRADUALLY NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD INTO EAST TENNESSEE...AND WEAKEN.
MEANWHILE...THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVING THROUGH EAST ARKANSAS TODAY
WILL MOVE TO OUR SOUTH WITH SOME RIDGING SPREADING INTO WESTERN AREAS
OF THE MIDSOUTH. DRIER AIR WILL GRADUALLY SPREAD INTO THE AREA FROM
THE NORTHWEST. THUS FOR THE FORECAST OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...
WE WILL SEE A GRADUAL DECREASE IN POPS. AFTER TODAY...HIGHEST POPS
WILL BE ACROSS EASTERN AREAS OF WEST TN AND NORTH MS...WITH LOWEST
POPS NORTHEAST AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL.

TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEK...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WILL BUILD
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH A RETURN TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS.

REMNANTS OF A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE OVER THE AREA TONIGHT AS AN UPPER 
LEVEL LOW ALONG THE GULF COAST BEGINS TO MOVE NORTHWARD. THE

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE MIDSOUTH. A FEW OF THESE 
THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE SEVERE LIKE YESTERDAY WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND 
LARGE HAIL BEING THE MAIN THREAT. 

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE HAVOC WITH THE WEATHER 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK AS IT MOVES SLOWLY NORTHWARD THROUGH 
ALABAMA. EXPECT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP 
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH THE EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA SEEING THE 
BEST CHANCES. WILL GO WITH A RANGE OF 20-50 POPS DURING THIS TIME 
WITH THE HIGHEST IN THE EAST. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO BE A TAD COOLER

THE MIDSOUTH IS LOCATED EARLY THIS MORNING BETWEEN LOW PRESSURE ALONG
THE NORTHERN GULF COAST AND A DYING COLD FRONT TO OUR NORTH.
AN IMPULSE ROTATING AROUND THE LOW HAS SPARKED A FEW THUNDERSTORMS
ACROSS NORTH ALABAMA THIS MORNING WHICH ARE MOVING WEST. THE COLD
FRONT TO OUR NORTH HAS BECOME RATHER DIFFUSE WITH LOWER DEWPOINTS
LOCATED ACROSS MISSOURI. A WEST TO EAST UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WHICH
HELPED TO PUSH THE COLD FRONT SOUTHWARD IS LOCATED THROUGH MO AND
IL AND HAS SET OFF A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IN SOUTHERN MO THIS MORNING.
THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO OUR NORTH WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTHEASTWARD
TODAY AND CONTINUE TO WEAKEN. MEANWHILE...LOW PRESSURE WILL
CONTINUE TO MEANDER ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF COAST. THE COMBINATION
OF THESE WEATHER FEATURES HAS INCREASED THE MEAN ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. THIS IN COMBINATION WITH DAYTIME HEATING WILL
CAUSE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA. MID LEVEL DRY AIR
WRAPPING AROUND THE NORTHWEST PERIPHERY OF THE LOW ALONG THE GULF
COAST HELPED TO SET OFF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY WITH
MICROBURSTS...YESTERDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS EASTERN PARTS OF THE
MIDSOUTH. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES SOME MID LEVEL DRY AIR
STILL WRAPPING IN ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH...BUT NOT NEARLY AS EXTENSIVE
AS YESTERDAY AS THE MIDSOUTH ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES TO MOISTEN. WILL
MENTION THE THREAT OF ISOLATED SEVERE FOR TODAY IN THE HAZARDOUS
WEATHER OUTLOOK WITH HIGH WINDS THE MAIN THREAT...BUT THINK THE
THREAT WILL BE LESS THAN YESTERDAY. ADDED HAZE TO THE GRIDS FOR
TODAY...HOPEFULLY THUNDERSTORMS TODAY WILL HELP TO CLEAN THE
ATMOSPHERE SOME. DAYTIME HIGHS WILL BE REDUCED A LITTLE AS A RESULT
OF THE INCREASE IN CONVECTION.

THE LOW ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL LIFT SLOWLY NORTHWARD THROUGH
ALABAMA THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...AND GRADUALLY WEAKEN. WILL HAVE
THE GREATEST POPS ACROSS EASTERN AREAS CLOSER TO THE LOW. BROAD
UPPER LEVEL TROFINESS WILL PERSIST ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH INTO THE
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...CONTINUING THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. HIGH
PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO BUILD ONCE AGAIN ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TOWARD
THE END OF THE WEEK REDUCING OUR CHANCES OF RAIN.

SATELLITE SHOWED MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH EARLY THIS
MORNING. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATED PATCHY FOG. TEMPERATURES
WERE AT SEASONAL LEVELS.

ANOTHER HOT DAY IS IN STORE FOR THE MIDSOUTH AS UPPER LEVEL HIGH
PRESSURE TRIES TO HOLD ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
FROM THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH THE UPPER MIDWEST WILL MOVE SLOWLY
SOUTHEASTWARD TODAY. THIS WILL HELP TO PUSH A COLD FRONT LOCATED
FROM CENTRAL IL TO SOUTHWEST MO TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH. HOWEVER...
THE FRONT WILL HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING IT VERY FAR SOUTHEASTWARD WITH
THE STRONG UPPER LEVEL HIGH ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. WILL CONTINUE
WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST OF 30 PERCENT POPS FOR TODAY...ALTHOUGH
THIS COULD BE A LITTLE ON THE HIGH SIDE. THE NAM DOES INDICATE AN
EAST TO WEST SURFACE TROUGH / WIND SHIFT DEVELOPING WELL AHEAD OF THE
FRONT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE
ALONG THIS BOUNDARY COULD HELP TO SPARK SOME THUNDERSTORMS.
LOOKING AT THE FORECAST DEWPOINT GRADIENTS...NOT SURE THE TRUE COLD
FRONT WILL EVER MAKE IT INTO THE MIDSOUTH.

THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE MIDSOUTH WILL WEAKEN AFTER TODAY...
BASICALLY LEAVING THE MIDSOUTH IN A WEAKNESS BETWEEN ONE HIGH TO THE
WEST AND ANOTHER TO THE EAST. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN RAIN
CHANCES OVER THE WEEKEND...POSSIBLY INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. BY
SATURDAY...THE COLD FRONT MOVING TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH WILL WEAKEN
ACROSS OR JUST NORTH OF THE AREA. MEANWHILE...LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE
NORTHERN GULF COAST WILL HELP TO PUSH INCREASING MOISTURE INTO
THE MIDSOUTH. ALL OF THIS COMBINED WITH DAYTIME HEATING...WILL LEAD
TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS THIS WEEKEND. AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND
RAIN WILL HELP TO HOLD DAYTIME TEMPERATURES DOWN SOME.

WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS INTO NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER...THE GFS
HINTS THE LOW ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF MAY MOVE NORTHWARD. IF THIS
OCCURS...POPS MAY NEED TO BE RAISED SOME FOR MONDAY. HIGH PRESSURE
ALOFT WILL ONCE AGAIN BUILD OVER THE MIDSOUTH TOWARD THE END OF

HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE OVER THE MID-
SOUTH THIS MORNING. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WITH TEMPERATURES RANGING
FROM THE UPPER 60S EAST TO THE MID AND UPPER 70S ACROSS THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES HAVE BOTTOMED OUT
NEAR THE DEWPOINTS OVER EASTERN AREAS AND THIS HAS ALLOWED AREAS OF
FOG TO ONCE AGAIN DEVELOP OVER THESE LOCATIONS.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA TODAY WITH SURFACE
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO THE EAST CONTINUING TO RIDGE WESTWARD
OVER THE MID-SOUTH. IN ADDITION...PLENTY OF DRY MID LEVEL AIR NOTED
ON LATEST WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND THIS ALONG WITH SUBSIDENCE SHOULD
PREVENT CONVECTION FROM DEVELOPING OVER MOST OF THE AREA TODAY.
WITH THIS IN MIND WILL KEEP PRECIPITATION CHANCES OUT OF THE FORECAST
FOR THIS AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION...SOME OF THE DRY AIR ALOFT MAY TEND
TO MIX DOWN INTO THE LOWER LEVELS AS DAYTIME HEATING BEGINS AND THIS
WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO HEAT UP A FEW DEGREES ABOVE YESTERDAYS
MAXES. ALSO...AFTER A SUNNY MORNING EXPECT SOME DIURNAL CU TO DEVELOP
AND RESULT IN PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES THIS AFTERNOON ALONG WITH HOT
AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES INTO THE MIDDLE 90S.

AS WE APPROACH THE WEEKEND...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NOW MAKING ITS
WAY EASTWARD ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA AND THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES
WILL SEND A COLD FRONT...NOW STRETCHED FROM THE GREAT LAKES
REGION SOUTHWEST ACROSS IOWA INTO NORTHERN KANSAS...TOWARDS THE MID-

THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST FOR LATE FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...WITH
THE HIGHEST CHANCES BEING DIURNALLY DRIVEN AND COINCIDING WITH PEAK
AFTERNOON HEATING. THE FRONT WILL TEND TO WASH OUT OVER THE AREA BY
THE END OF THE WEEKEND. WITH THE FRONT IN THE VICINITY AND CHANCES
FOR SHOWERS...THUNDERSTORMS...AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER...HAVE
KNOCKED TEMPERATURES BACK A FEW DEGREES FOR THE WEEKEND AS WELL.
STILL NOT LOOKING FOR A WASH OUT BY ANY MEANS THIS WEEKEND...AND
CONVECTIVE COVERAGE SHOULD REMAIN SCATTERED.

FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD...A WEAKNESS IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE
ATMOSPHERE...LEFT BEHIND BY THE DEPARTING TROUGH OVER THE WEEKEND
WILL PERSIST INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. AT THE SAME TIME...MEDIUM RANGE
MODELS ARE CONTINUING TO INDICATE THE PERSISTENT SURFACE TROUGH
CURRENTLY STRETCHED ALONG THE GULF COAST...SLOWLY LIFTING BACK TO THE
NORTH DURING THIS TIME PERIOD...ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED DEEPER
MOISTURE. THEREFORE...HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE CHANCES FOR SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN NEAR OR SLIGHTLY BELOW CLIMATOLOGY DURING
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...DUE TO EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND POSSIBLE
CONVECTION.

A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WAS IN CONTROL OF THE SOUTHERN TWO 
THIRDS OF THE U.S. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS BUILT SOUTHWEST INTO 
EASTERN TENNESSEE TODAY AND PUSHED THE MAJORITY OF CONVECTION INTO 
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS COULD STILL DEVELOP 
BETWEEN NOW AND SUNSET BUT NOTHING TO HANG OUR HAT ON.

A DECENT TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS SOUTH/CENTRAL CANADA OVERNIGHT. 
THIS WILL HELP PUSH A COLD FRONT CLOSER TO THE MID SOUTH. TRANQUIL 
WEATHER I.E. HOT AND DRY WILL PERSIST UNTIL THE BEGINNING OF THE 
WEEKEND WHEN THIS FRONT WILL SLOWLY ENTER THE FORECAST AREA.

THE SPEED OF THE FRONT WILL DETERMINE IF CHANCES OF RAIN FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THEY WILL NEED TO BE HIGHER IF THE FRONT MOVES FASTER THAN WE 
ARE THINKING FOR THIS FORECAST. ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT THE FRONT 
STALLING AND BISECTING THE AREA. IN ADDITION...THERE IS A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING ACROSS MISSOURI SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS SHORTWAVE 
WILL BE SLOW TO EXIT THE AREA AS IT WILL JUST DEEPEN A TROUGH THAT 
SETS UP OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THE TROUGH WILL SLOWLY PUSH 
EAST AS THE RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN U.S. DRIFTS EASTWARD TOWARD THE 
END OF NEXT WEEK.

LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS HIGH OVER THE WHOLE AREA THROUGH THE 
FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK. THUS RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT 
ON THE FEATURES DESCRIBED ABOVE.

ANOTHER QUIET MORNING ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH WITH CLEAR SKIES AND
TEMPERATURES PRIMARILY IN THE 70S AREAWIDE. SOME PATCHY FOG AND
HAZE HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE AREA AS WELL.

THE OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN WILL REMAIN THE SAME TODAY WITH SURFACE
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE OHIO VALLEY EXTENDING SOUTHWARD
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD
OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA...WITH WEAK UPPER LEVEL
TROUGHING STILL REMAINING IN PLACE OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS. THIS WEAK
UPPER SUPPORT COMBINED WITH INCREASED INSTABILITY FROM SUFFICIENT
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND DAYTIME HEATING WILL AGAIN SUPPORT THE
DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN
THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. THINK THAT OVERALL COVERAGE MAY BE A
BIT LESS THAN THAT SEEN YESTERDAY AFTERNOON...BUT STILL ENOUGH TO
WARRANT THE 20 POP SOUTH. TEMPERATURES SHOULD ONCE AGAIN BE SIMILAR
TO OR A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN YESTERDAYS HIGHS.

THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING OVER SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA TODAY
WILL GIVE WAY TO RISING HEIGHTS AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER MOST
OF THE MID-SOUTH ON THURSDAY. THIS SHOULD HELP FURTHER LIMIT
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND HAVE LEFT MENTION OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS OUT OF THE ZONES (14% POPS). WITH INCREASED RIDGING...
LESS CLOUD COVER AND CONVECTION...BELIEVE THAT TEMPERATURES WILL BE
EVEN A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER ON THURSDAY.

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN ROCKIES
WILL MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES AND INTO THE
GREAT LAKES REGION THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS WILL HELP TO SEND A COLD
FRONT TOWARDS THE REGION FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. MODELS HAVE
TRENDED SLOWER AND LESS AGGRESSIVE WITH THE SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION
OF THE FRONT. LOOKING AT CURRENT UPPER AIR PATTERN...TEND TO FAVOR
LESS SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT. THINK FRONT WILL MOVE INTO NORTHERN AREAS
ON FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT BEFORE STALLING OUT ON SATURDAY...AND
WASHING OUT COMPLETELY ON SUNDAY. HAVE TRIMMED POPS BACK ON THURSDAY
NIGHT TO JUST SLIGHT CHANCE OVER NORTHERN SECTIONS AND KEPT LOW END
CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE ON FRIDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR WEAK FRONT IN AREA AND
DAYTIME INSTABILITY. LINGERED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS INTO SATURDAY IN
ASSOCIATION WITH STALLED FRONT. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE HELD BACK A
FEW DEGREES FRIDAY AND SATURDAY DUE TO MORE CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION
CHANCES.

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK IN ON SUNDAY WITH A DRY DAY...BEFORE
A STALLED SURFACE TROUGH AND DEEPER MOISTURE TO THE SOUTH MOVES BACK
INTO THE AREA FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK UNDER SOUTHERLY FLOW.
HAVE THEREFORE KEPT LOW END POPS INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK TO ACCOUNT FOR
THIS POSSIBILITY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN NEAR NORMAL THROUGH THE
EXTENDED PERIOD.

A TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN EXISTS OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING.
SKIES REMAIN CLEAR WITH AREAS OF PATCHY FOG ACROSS AREAS OF
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI WHERE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LEVELS REMAIN
HIGHEST. TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM THE LOW 70S IN RURAL AREAS TO THE
UPPER 70S IN THE MEMPHIS URBAN AREA.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY WILL
RIDGE DOWN ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL
HELP SUPPRESS CONVECTION OVER THESE AREAS. FURTHER SOUTH...A
PERSISTENT WEAK SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS ACROSS MISSISSIPPI INTO
ALABAMA. IN ADDITION...A WEAK UPPER TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN
TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH INTO SOUTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. OVER THESE AREAS...ENOUGH LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE COMBINED WITH DAYTIME HEATING WILL LEAD TO INCREASED
INSTABILITY...AND WITH THE PRESENCE OF THE TROUGH...WILL ALLOW FOR
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE UPPER
TROUGH AXIS WILL LINGER OVER PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI INTO
TOMORROW...THEREFORE WILL KEEP ISOLATED CHANCES FOR CONVECTION IN
PLACE ON WEDNESDAY ACROSS THESE AREAS. AS FOR TEMPERATURES DURING
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND STRONGER RIDGING
OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA...EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO REACH
THE MIDDLE 90S. ELSEWHERE...ISOLATED CONVECTION AND MOISTER
CONDITIONS WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES BACK A FEW DEGREES IN THE LOWER
90S.

ON THURSDAY...THE WEAK UPPER TROUGH SLIPS FURTHER SOUTH AND UPPER
LEVEL RIDGING STRENGTHENS. THIS SHOULD KEEP MOST AREAS DRY...
ALTHOUGH A VERY ISOLATED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM WILL STILL BE
POSSIBLE DURING THE MAXIMUM HEATING OF THE DAY. WITH STRONGER
RIDGING AND DRY CONDITIONS...EXPECT THURSDAY TO BE THE WARMEST DAY
THIS WEEK...WITH MID 90S COMMON IN MOST AREAS. BY LATER THURSDAY...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL
HELP PUSH A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE MID-SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT.
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT
ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY AS THE FRONT STALLS OUT
OVER THE REGION. CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL
CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY WITH THE FRONT WASHING OUT OVER THE AREA THIS
WEEKEND. WITH INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES...TEMPERATURES
WILL BE HELD BACK A FEW DEGREES.

WEAK UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BUILD BACK OVER THE AREA FOR THE END
OF THE WEEKEND AND FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK...ALLOWING FOR THE RETURN
OF DRY WEATHER AND SEASONABLY HOT WEATHER.

THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE SURFACE AND
UPPER AIR PATTERNS FOR THE LAST 48 HOURS. AIRMASS IS BECOMING
SOMEWHAT STAGNANT OVER THE AREA...AND IS BEING REFLECTED BY HAZE
REDUCING SOME VISIBILITIES BELOW 7 SM. CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT IS MAINLY
OVER SOUTHEAST HALF OF CWA. ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO
DEVELOP ACROSS SOUTHEAST HALF OF CWA. TEMPERATURE TRENDS THROUGH
17Z SHOW MOST AREAS 2-3 DEGREES WARMER THAN SUNDAY.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH THURSDAY)...
MID-AFTERNOON AREAL COVERAGE OF PRECIPITATION (20-30 PCT) WILL
DICTATE POPS FOR THE EVENING HOURS. WOULD EXPECT MOST...IF NOT ALL...
CONVECTION TO DIE OUT BY 03Z TONIGHT.

PATTERN CONTINUES RATHER STAGNANT THROUGH THURSDAY...SO NOT MUCH
CHANGE IN FORECAST OTHER THAN PRECIPITATION CHANCES. AIRMASS WILL BE
SOMEWHAT LESS FAVORABLE FOR CONVECTION TOMORROW...AND WILL PRETTY
MUCH LIMIT PRECIPITATION TO SOUTH OF THE TENNESSEE-MISSISSIPPI STATE
LINE. EVEN THERE...POPS GENERALLY AT OR BELOW 30 PERCENT. FOR NOW...
WILL KEEP WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY DRY...BUT WOULD NOT BE ABSOLUTELY
SHOCKED TO SEE VERY ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI.
COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA FROM THE NORTH ON THURSDAY NIGHT...
SO WILL HOLD MENTION IN THERE...SINCE SPEED OF FRONT VARIES ON THE
DIFFERENT MODELS.

TEMPERATURES...GOING FORECAST LOOKS FINE FOR TONIGHT...AND PROBABLY
DONT NEED TO ADJUST ANY FOR TOMORROW THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
THURSDAY WILL PROBABLY BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE WEEK...AND BUMPED
UP PREVIOUS FORECAST A DEGREE. MOST AREAS SHOULD BE IN THE MIDDLE
90S.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER THURSDAY)...
FRONTAL SYSTEM TO MOVE INTO THE AREA ON FRIDAY...THEN LIKELY TO WASH
OUT. USUALLY PRETTY DIFFICULT TO GET A COLD FRONT ENTIRELY THROUGH
THE CWA DURING THE MIDDLE OF THE SUMMER...AND THERE IS NO SIGNIFICANT
FORCING TO MOVE IT OUT OF THE AREA. MOISTURE LACKING WITH THIS
SYSTEM...AND SURFACE CONVERGENCE IS RATHER WEAK. WILL KEEP IN 20-30
POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AS THIS IS BEST
CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD. WEAK UPPER RIDGE
BECOMES ESTABLISHED OVER SOUTHEAST STATES OVER THE WEEKEND. THIS
SHOULD KEEP THE LAST FEW DAYS OF THE EXTENDED DRY...ALTHOUGH...
AGAIN...VERY ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WOULD NOT BE A SURPRISE.

TEMPERATURES...FRIDAY MAY BE A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN THURSDAY...
MORE DUE TO ADDITIONAL CLOUDS THAN ANYTHING. FRONTAL SYSTEM IN THE

SKIES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS EVENING. WSR-88D IMAGERY THE PAST 
COUPLE OF HOURS SHOWING RAIN SHOWER ACTIVITY ACROSS NORTHERN AND 
CENTRAL ALABAMA STARTING TO DIMINISH WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING. THIS ACTIVITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH A MID LEVEL TROUGH AXIS 
BISECTING THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. 

SOUNDINGS FROM KLZK AND KSGF SHOW MID LEVEL SUBSIDENCE INVERSION 
DEEPENING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH BUT SOME ADDITIONAL MOISTURE PRESENT 
AT KJAN. AS A RESULT...NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. WINDS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO DECOUPLE ACROSS 
MOST AREAS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF KMEM THUS FAR. WILL MAKE MINOR 
ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPERATURE GRIDS BASED UPON CURRENT TRENDS BUT LOW 
TEMPERATURES ARE ON TRACK WITH CURRENT SURFACE DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 240 PM CDT FRI JUL 29 2005...
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND COMFORTABLE HUMIDITY LEVELS HAVE 
GRACED THE MIDSOUTH TODAY THANKS TO NW FLOW ALOFT. THIS FLOW IS 
BRINGING DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION AND HAS BROUGHT AN END TO THE 
SHOWERS AND MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVER NE MS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
A FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD FORECAST FOR THE AREA OVER THE WEEKEND. AT 
THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN RESPONSE TO THE RIDGE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS NOSING INTO THE AREA. THE AIRMASS IS EXPECTED TO 
REMAIN RATHER DRY...AS EVIDENT TODAY BY THE 0.74 INCH PRECIPITABLE 
WATER AT LZK. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF CU DEVELOPMENT 
ALTHOUGH CANNOT RULE OUT A FEW CU WITH THE MAX DAYTIME HEATING. A 
LITTLE MORE CLOUD COVER MAY OCCUR OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA 
AS IT WILL BE CLOSER TO A SFC TROUGH. TEMPS WILL GRADUALLY WARM BACK 
TO NEAR NORMAL...BUT DEWPOINTS WILL REMAIN IN THE 60S AS A NORTHEAST 
SFC FLOW WILL NOT PROMOTE MUCH OF A RISE. IT WILL CERTAINLY BE A 
VERY NICE WEEKEND FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
MODELS IN FAIR AGREE ON DEVELOPING A WEAKNESS OVER THE REGION BY 
MONDAY...AS THE AREA SITS BETWEEN A BUILDING WESTERN RIDGE AND THE 
BERMUDA HIGH. A SFC TROUGH IS FORECAST TO LIFT NORTHWEST IN 
RESPONSE...PLACING THE MIDSOUTH IN AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN. THE 
QUESTION FOR PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE HOW MUCH MOISTURE RETURN WILL 
THERE BE? GFS SHOWS DECENT 850-700MB MOISTURE RETURNING WHICH WOULD
FAVOR MORE PRECIP ACROSS THE AREA. THE ECMWF HOLDS THE MOISTURE 
FURTHER SOUTH AND DOES NOT DEVELOP THE WEAKNESS LIKE THE GFS DOES. 
OVERALL GLOBAL MODEL CONSENSUS IS THAT A SFC TROUGH WILL BE LOCATED
OVER THE GENERAL AREA THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS RESULTS IN PUTTING SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS OVER THE AREA. LACK OF CONFIDENCE IN MOISTURE 
RETURN PRECLUDES ANY HIGHER POPS AT THIS TIME. THE CURRENT EXTENDED 
FORECAST SHOWS THIS WELL AND ONLY MADE SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO THE 
GRIDS. TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE NEAR NORMAL AND DEWPOINTS WILL NOT 
BEGIN TO REALLY CLIMB UNTIL THE THURSDAY/FRIDAY TIME PERIOD.

.UPDATE...
THERE IS QUITE A SPREAD IN WEATHER CONDITIONS ACROSS THE CWA THIS 
MORNING. THE WEATHER RANGES FROM SUNNY IN NW AREAS TO CLOUDY WITH 
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER NE MS. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND RUC ANALYSIS 
SHOWS SIGNIFICANT DRY AIR WORKING INTO THE REGION UNDER NW FLOW. 
THERE IS ALSO A SHORTWAVE EMBEDDED IN THE NW FLOW OVER ARKANSAS AT 
THIS TIME. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND ASSOCIATED CLOUDS AND PRECIP 
HAVING A TOUGH TIME MOVING OUT OF NE MS. WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST TO 
ADJUST CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE CWA. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WILL BE LEFT 
AS IS FOR NE MS DUE TO THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND AN APPROACHING 
SHORTWAVE. ALSO DROPPED HIGH TEMPS A CATEGORY IN NE MS DUE TO ALL OF 
THE CLOUDS. 850 TEMPS OF 14C TO 15C SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE MID TO 
UPPER 80S IN THOSE LOCATIONS THAT RECEIVE SUN TODAY AND THE CURRENT 
FORECAST HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON THIS.

THE REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AND THE UPDATED ZONES WILL BE

FRONTAL CLOUDINESS ACRS NRN MS THIS MORNING WITH A FEW SHOWERS SOUTH

FRONTAL MOISTURE PUSHES SOUTHEAST OF THE REGION. STILL ENUF 
MOISTURE TO JUSTIFY A 20 POP ACRS NE MS TO COVER ANY SHOWERS THAT

WL CONT TO BUILD ACRS THE AREA WITH LIGHT NORTHERLY FLOW. TEMPS WL 
REMAIN BELOW SEASONAL NORMS WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S AND LOW 
HUMIDITIES.

TONIGHT THRU SUN NIGHT...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ACRS THE OH AND MID 
MS VALLEYS AND A STRONG UPPER RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN PLAINS DOMINATE 
THE WEATHER PATTERN. EXPECT DRY CONDS WITH A SLOW WARMING TREND FOR 
THE MID SOUTH AND COMFORTABLE HUMIDITIES. 

BY MON/MON NIGHT GFS INDICATING A WEAK UPPER LOW DEVELOPING ACRS THE 
SRN MS VALLEY. MEANWHILE THE STALLED SFC FRONT ACRS THE GULF AND THE

ADDRESSES THIS WELL WITH POPS ACRS NRN MS STARTING MON. ACCORDING TO 
THE GFS...MOISTURE AND RAIN CHANCES WL PUSH NORTH THROUGH MID WEEK. 
ECMWF SEEMS TO KEEP MOISTURE MORE SUPPRESSED TO THE SOUTH SO  
UNCERTAINTY WITH FORECAST BEYOND MON IS HIGH. WL NOT MAKE ANY

LIGHT NORTH AND NORTHEASTERLY WINDS WERE OCCURRING OVER THE MID 
SOUTH THIS EVENING AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA. IT

DRY SLOT EVIDENT ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY WITH MOISTURE AXIS 
STRETCHING ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI INTO CENTRAL TENNESSEE. 
APPEARS THAT SOME SHOWER DEVELOPMENT WILL BE POSSIBLE MAINLY OVER 
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AROUND OR JUST AFTER MIDNIGHT AND PERSIST INTO

ACROSS OUR EXTREME SOUTHERN COUNTIES WITH THE FRONT NOT TOO FAR AWAY.
BY TONIGHT...FRONT SHOULD HAVE WEAKENED FURTHER AND MOVED AWAY FROM
THE FORECAST AREA THAT ONLY EXTREME SOUTHEAST CORNER HAS ANY CHANCE

A STRONG COLD FRONT FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR BISECTS THE MIDSOUTH

NORTHEAST ARKANSAS TO THE MID 90S AROUND TUPELO. LATEST SURFACE
ANALYSIS INDICATES THE FRONT EXTENDS FROM ABOUT LEXINGTON TN TO
TUNICA MS TO JUST SOUTH OF STUTTGART AR. A BROKEN BAND OF STRONG
THUNDERSTORMS HAS DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THE FRONT. WITH CAPES
RANGING FROM 2000 TO 4000 J/KG ACROSS NORTH MS...THERE COULD BE A FEW
STRONG TO POSSIBLY SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS INTO THIS EVENING AHEAD
OF THE FRONT WITH THE THREATS BEING STRONG WINDS AND HAIL. LIGHT
SHOWERS ARE LOCATED BEHIND THE FRONT ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHEAST AR AND
THE MO BOOTHEEL. THINK THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH SLOWLY THROUGH
THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY. WILL HAVE POPS TONIGHT
RANGING FROM 60 PERCENT ACROSS MUCH OF NORTH MS TO 30 PERCENT
NORTHEAST AR / MO BOOTHEEL. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL END FROM THE
NORTH THURSDAY AS THE FRONT CONTINUES TO SAG SOUTHWARD AND DRIER AIR
WORKS ITS WAY INTO THE MIDSOUTH. BAND OF LOW CLOUDS WILL SPREAD

CLEAR FROM THE NORTH THURSDAY.

WILL LEAVE IN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AROUND TUPELO THURSDAY
NIGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE FRONT. OTHERWISE...WILL HAVE A DRY
FORECAST FOR THE ENTIRE AREA FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST.
SOME WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROFFINESS DEVELOPS MAINLY OVER THE EASTERN
PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH INTO THIS WEEKEND...BUT DOES NOT SEEM TO BE
ENOUGH MOISTURE TO SUPPORT ANY MORE THAN A FEW SHOWERS AT MOST...

COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING WITH
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BEHIND THE FRONT ACROSS SOUTHERN MISSOURI
AND NORTHWEST ARKANSAS.

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SOUTHEAST TODAY AND TONIGHT.
STILL APPEARS THAT WE WILL SE SOME RAIN IN THE FORECAST AREA SO HAVE
KEPT LIKELY POPS FOR TODAY. THE BIG STORY WILL BE TEMPERATURES AS
READINGS WILL SOME 5-10 DEGREES COOLER THAN THEY WERE ON TUESDAY.
COLD FRONT WILL REMAIN ACROSS REGION TONIGHT SO WILL SEE SOME
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS IN THE
FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. COLD FRONT SHOULD HAVE MOVED INTO NORTH
MISSISSIPPI BY THURSDAY SO RAIN CHANCE SHOULD DIMINISH OVER NORTHERN
AREAS. THE FRONT SHOULD CONTINUE TO PUSH FURTHER SOUTH AND WEAKEN BY
THURSDAY NIGHT SO ONLY HAVE CHANCE POPS IN SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE
FORECAST AREA. FRIDAY SHOULD REMAIN DRY AS WHAT IS LEFT OF THE FRONT
IS SOUTH OF FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN BELOW NORMAL
FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM (AFTER FRIDAY)...
GRADUAL WARMUP SHOULD START OVER THE WEEKEND AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE
ATTEMPTS TO REESTABLISH ITSELF. DRY WEATHER SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH
THE WEEKEND INTO THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. ANOTHER COLD FRONT
TRIES TO MOVE INTO THE REGION ON TUESDAY SO THERE MAY BE SOME RAIN

.DISCUSSION...
UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO SLIDE FURTHER EAST WHILE AN UPPER TROUGH 
AND COLD FRONT ARE PROGRESSING TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH. TEMPERATURES ARE 
IN THE MID 90S WITH HEAT INDICES FROM 105 TO 110. A FEW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED BUT ARE SHORT LIVED.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN WILL BE ADVANCEMENT OF FRONT AND PRECIP 
CHANCES ACROSS THE REGION. FIRST THINGS FIRST...WILL KEEP A MENTION 
OF ISOLATED SHWRS/TSTMS DURING THE EVENING JUST TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY 
DIURNAL DRIVEN CONVECTION. AFTER THAT...POPS WILL INCREASE ACROSS 
NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA AS THE FRONT ADVANCES SOUTHEAST. 
MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING OF THE FRONT...ENTERING IT 
INTO NE AR AROUND 10-11Z. BOTH GFS AND NAM SHOW THAT MOST OF THE 
PRECIP WILL BE POST FRONTAL AS THE MAIN FORCING WITH THE TROUGH WILL 
LAG BEHIND THE FRONT. HOWEVER...CERTAINLY CANNOT RULE OUT 
DEVELOPMENT AHEAD OF THE FRONT GIVEN THE WARM AND MOIST AIRMASS IN 
PLACE. THE HEAT ADVISORY AND WARNING WILL BE ALLOWED TO EXPIRE AT 10 
PM. REGARDING SEVERE POTENTIAL...SPC KEEPS SLIGHT RISK NORTH OF THE 
AREA TONIGHT. AGREE WITH THIS SINCE THE FRONT WILL COME THROUGH IN 
THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. ALSO...MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES OF LESS THAN 6 
C/KM WILL INHIBIT SEVERE POTENTIAL. 

FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS THROUGH THE CWA DURING THE DAY 
TOMORROW. AGAIN...MODELS SHOWING MOSTLY POST FRONTAL PRECIP BUT 
CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE FRONT IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY. HAVE GONE 
WITH 60 POPS AREAWIDE. COULD BE A FEW STRONG STORMS IN NORTH MS 
WHERE THERE WILL BE MORE TIME TO HEAT UP THE ATMOSPHERE. 
AGAIN...SEVERE WEATHER NOT ANTICIPATED BUT WILL MENTION THE THREAT 
OF A FEW STRONG STORMS.

CHANCES OF PRECIP WILL LINGER INTO THURSDAY AS THE MODELS HINT AT 
CONTINUED POST FRONTAL PRECIP AS THE FRONT STALLS OVER CENTRAL 
MS/AL. AS NW FLOW BECOMES ESTABLISHED...THIS WILL HELP TO END THE 
PRECIP OVER THE AREA BY THURSDAY EVENING. THERE WILL BE A NOTICEABLE 
AIRMASS CHANGE BEHIND THE FRONT. HIGHS FOR THE END OF THE WEEK WILL 
BE IN THE 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S...CERTAINLY COMFORTABLE FOR 
THIS TIME OF THE YEAR.

&&

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...

THE WEEKEND LOOKS DRY...WITH WEAK NW FLOW CONTINUE. THE REGION WILL 
BE IN A WEAKNESS IN THE UPPER FLOW AS UPPER RIDGING BUILDS TO OUR 
WEST AND EAST. LITTLE MOISTURE WILL EXIST ABOVE 850 MB SO THAT 
SHOULD PREVENT ANY PRECIP. TEMPS WILL WARM TO NEAR SEASONABLE LEVELS 
BUT DEWPOINTS WILL STAY IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
RAIN RETURNS TO EASTERN AREAS ON MONDAY AND TO THE WHOLE AREA ON 
TUESDAY AS DAYTIME HEATING AND INCREASED MOISTURE INCREASE.

MIDSOUTH. MEANWHILE...AN UPPER TROUGH IS PROGRESSING EAST ACROSS THE 
PLAIN STATES. THIS IS PUTTING THE MIDSOUTH UNDER INCREASING SW BOTH 
AT THE SFC AND ALOFT. 

HAVE REINTRODUCED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. A FEW STORMS MANAGED TO DEVELOP LATE YESTERDAY 
AFTERNOON EVEN WHEN THE RIDGE WAS DIRECTLY OVER THE REGION. MORNING 
SOUNDINGS DO NOT SHOW MUCH OF A CAP TODAY AND WITH THE RIDGE TO THE 
EAST NOW...CANNOT RULE OUT A FEW SHOWERS OR TSTMS IN THE PRIME 
HEATING OF THE DAY. 

TEMPS WILL BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY (MID TO UPPER 90S.) HEAT INDICES 
WILL RANGE FROM 105 TO JUST ABOVE 110. THE HEAT WARNING AND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE MIDSOUTH TODAY WILL BEGIN TO 
SLIDE EASTWARD AS A TROUGH OVER THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST TRANSLATES 
EAST OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

BEFORE THE RIDGE GIVES WAY TO THE TROUGH...ANOTHER WARM AND MUGGY 
NIGHT TONIGHT AND A HOT DAY TOMORROW CAN BE EXPECTED. HIGHS TOMORROW 
WILL STILL BE IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S. GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO 
OVERPLAY HIGH TEMPS...PROBABLY DUE TO MOIST SOIL CONDITIONS. WILL 
FOLLOW THE TREND FROM THE PREVIOUS SHIFT AND UNDERCUT GUIDANCE ONE 
OR TWO DEGREES TOMORROW. HEAT INDICES LOOK TO RUN FROM 105 TO 110 
TOMORROW. LOCATIONS UNDER THE HEAT WARNING MAY NOT QUITE REACH 
CRITERIA OF 110 OR GREATER...BUT IT IS TOO CLOSE TO CALL RIGHT NOW 
AND WILL LEAVE ALL ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS AS IS. DO NOT WANT 
ANYBODY TO THINK THAT CONDITIONS WILL NOT BE DANGEROUS TOMORROW. THE 
MIDNIGHT SHIFT CAN REEVALUATE THE SITUATION. THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF AFTERNOON CONVECTION WITH THE RIDGE MOVING EAST.

UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO PUSH IN TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY...SENDING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION. LATEST MODELS 
QUICKER IN BRINGING FRONT THROUGH...BUT WILL DELAY THE TIMING A 
LITTLE JUST BASED ON THE FACT THAT IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR FRONTS TO 
SLOW DOWN THIS TIME OF YEAR. WILL INCREASE POPS TO HIGH CHANCE FOR 
NW AREAS OVERNIGHT TUESDAY...AND HIGH CHANCE EVERYWHERE ON 
WEDNESDAY. MODELS ALSO HINT AT POST FRONTAL PRECIP...SO WILL BE SLOW 
TO REMOVE POPS ON THURSDAY. LOWER DEWPOINTS AND SLIGHTLY BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPS WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. IT 
WILL DEFINITELY BE SOME WELCOMED RELIEF.

&&

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY TIME PERIOD WILL BE FAIRLY TRANQUIL FOR 
MOST OF THE AREA. GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE THE REGION WILL BE UNDER 
THE INFLUENCE OF A BROAD TROUGH...BASICALLY A WEAKNESS IN THE 
PATTERN BETWEEN THE BUILDING RIDGE TO THE WEST AND THE BERMUDA HIGH 
TO THE EAST. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN DRY SO NO PRECIP EXPECTED AT 
THIS TIME. THE EXCEPTION WOULD BE ACROSS AREAS OF NORTH MS. GFS 
INDICATES A SFC LOW DEVELOPING OVER CENTRAL MS/AL IN RESPONSE TO THE 
UPPER WEAKNESS. A SFC TROF WOULD EXTEND NORTH FROM THE 
LOW...POSSIBLY AFFECTING NE MS. CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH AT THIS 
TIME...BUT FELT IT PRUDENT TO KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THOSE 
AREAS THROUGH THE FORECAST. TEMPS WILL WARM TO NEAR SEASONABLE 
LEVELS OVER THE WEEKEND BUT DEWPOINTS WILL REMAIN IN THE 60S SINCE 
THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A  RETURN FLOW OFF OF THE GULF TO BRING THEM 
BACK UP.

1050 AM CDT SUN JUL 24 2005

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE AND UPPER AIR ANALYSIS PLACES STACKED 1019 MB 
HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND THE MID SOUTH. MAIN 
SHORT TERM CONCERN FOR THIS AFTERNOON IS ONGOING HEADLINES DUE TO 
THE HEAT. VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS ONLY A FEW CIRRUS FROM THE EASTERN 
EDGE OF THE RIDGE DRIFTING WEST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 850 
TEMPERATURES AROUND 22C THIS MORNING ON KLZK SOUNDING SUGGESTS 
TEMPERATURES AT LEAST SIMILAR IF NOT A COUPLE OF DEGREES HIGHER THAN 
YESTERDAY. UNFORTUNATELY SURFACE DEWPOINTS IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 
70S ARE ALREADY PRODUCING HEAT INDICIES IN THE 100 TO 105 DEGREE 
RANGE ACROSS MANY AREAS IN THE FORECAST AREA. WILL NOT MAKE ANY 
CHANGES TO CURRENT TRENDS OTHER THAN MINOR TWEAKS TO TEMPERATURES 
AND DEWPOINTS. WILL MONITOR TRENDS AND UPGRADE THE HEAT ADVISORY 
AREA TO AN EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING IF CONDITIONS JUSTIFY A CHANGE. 

NO UPDATE WILL BE ISSUED AT THIS TIME.

OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...SO DONT EXPECT MUCH CHANGE IN HIGH
TEMPERATURES. HIGHS IN UPPER 90S NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS STILL APPEARS TO
BE VERY REASONABLE. AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS WILL BE DETERMINING FACTOR
WHETHER ADVISORY OR WARNING CRITERIA ARE MET. LAST COUPLE OF

CONFIGURATION OF WARNING/ADVISORY WILL BE HELD. DAY SHIFT WILL NEED
TO CONSIDER DRAGGING THESE PRODUCTS INTO TUESDAY. ALTHOUGH
TEMPERATURES MAY BE A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER TUESDAY...STILL NO RELIEF
FROM THE SITUATION.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE NORTH APPEARS TO BE SLOWER IN APPROACHING THE
AREA THAN EARLIER RUNS INDICATED. THIS WILL HAVE TWO EFFECTS ON THE
FORECAST. PRECIPITATION LIKELY TO BE DELAYED IN REACHING THE AREA.
STABILITY AND MOISTURE PARAMETERS ACTUALLY A LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE
FOR CONVECTION MONDAY THAN THEY ARE TUESDAY. ANY CONVECTIVE
DEVELOPMENT EITHER DAY LIKELY TO BE RATHER ISOLATED. MONDAY FORECAST
WAS ALREADY DRY...AND WILL HOLD WITH THAT. WE HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE
MENTIONED ON TUESDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE RATHER LOW. NEIGHBORS STILL
HAVE MENTION OF PRECIP TUESDAY...SO WILL HOLD THE CURRENT 20 POPS.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER TUESDAY)...
EXPECT WEAK COLD FRONT TO BE IN THE AREA FOR THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH
FRIDAY PERIOD. THIS WILL NECESSITATE KEEPING MENTION OF
PRECIPITATION IN THE FORECAST. ECMWF AND GFS RUNS AT 00Z INDICATE
FRONT TO BE SOUTH OF THE AREA BY SATURDAY. THIS WOULD MAKE FOR A
DRY FORECAST ON SATURDAY. SINCE MOST NEIGHBORS STILL HAVE MENTION
OF PRECIP FOR SATURDAY...WILL CONTINUE MENTION ONE MORE DAY. WILL
BRIEF DAY SHIFT ON TREND.

WITH FRONT IN THE AREA...WE WILL SEE MORE CLOUDINESS STARTING
WEDNESDAY...AT A MINIMUM. THIS WILL ALLOW US TO SEE MAX TEMPERATURES
A LITTLE CLOSER TO NORMAL BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO LONG
TERM PORTION OF THE FORECAST THIS PACKAGE.

.DISCUSSION...THIS AFTERNOON/S SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES 1018MB HIGH 
PRESSURE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. VISIBLE SATELLITE TRENDS SHOW DIURNAL 
BASED CUMULUS ACROSS THE MIDDLE/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH ONLY 
CONVECTION THUS FAR ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS AND ALONG THE I-44 
CORRIDOR IN MO ALONG SURFACE CONVERGENCE AXIS. MAIN FORECAST 
CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE FOCUSES AROUND HEAT ADVISORY/HEAT WARNING 
POTENTIAL THROUGH MONDAY AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES AS NEXT COLD 
FRONT APPROACHES THE MID SOUTH BY MID WEEK. 

TONIGHT...SKIES WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS 
DIURNAL CUMULUS DECREASES WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEAT. LOW 
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT/S WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE OVERHEAD AND LOWER DEWPOINTS ACROSS EASTERN TENNESSEE 
TRYING TO SPILL IN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON A VERY LIGHT EAST 
WIND.   

SUNDAY AND MONDAY...ANOTHER HOT DAY EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS 
22-23C 850MB AIR MIXES DOWN TO THE SURFACE DURING THE AFTERNOON 
PRODUCING HIGHS APPROACHING THE CENTURY MARK. DEWPOINTS IN THE 
MIDDLE 70S WILL PRODUCE HEAT INDICIES IN THE 105-115 DEGREE MARK 
JUSTIFYING AN UPGRADE TO A EXCESSIVE HEAT WARNING ACROSS PORTIONS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. 

TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...LONG RANGE MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT AT 
LEAST THROUGH DAY 5. BY DAY 6 /NEXT SATURDAY/ BOTH THE 18Z/22 DGEX 
AND 00Z/23 GFS SHOW A TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE MID SOUTH LATE

DISCUSSION...12Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS A RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND MIDDLE 
MISSSISSIPPI VALLEY. LOW LEVEL MOISUTRE HAS DIMINISHED FROM 
YESTERDAY WITH 850MB MOISTURE TONGUE EXTENDING FROM THE GULF TO NEAR 
JACKSON MS. VISIBLE SATELLITE TRENDS THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS 
SHOWING DIURNAL BASED CU DECK DEVELOPING ACROSS THE EASTERN ONE 
THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. FORECAST CONCERNS THIS AFTERNOON ARE 
TEMPERATURES...HEAT INDEX...AND ISOLATED CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL. 

850MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 19C ON KJAN/KBMX RAOBS AND 24C AT KSGF 
SUGGEST TEMPERATURES COULD REACH THE CENTURY MARK THIS AFTERNOON 
ACROSS A PORTION OF THE AREA MAINLY ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND IN 
MEMPHIS. THESE TEMPERATURES COMBINED WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS IN THE 
70S WILL PRODUCE HEAT INDICIES UP TO AROUND 105-108F. WILL NOT 
UPGRADE HEAT ADVISORY TO A WARNING AT THIS TIME BUT WILL CLOSELY 
MONITOR TRENDS THIS AFTERNOON.   

CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL WILL BE HARD TO COME BY THIS AFTERNOON WITH NO 
UPPER LEVEL ATMOSPHERIC SUPPORT FOR CONVECTION. SHORT TERM MODEL 
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT A MODIFIED SURFACE BASED PARCEL LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON (99/73) WILL PRODUCE 4000 J/KG CAPE...LI/S AROUND -8 AND 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 2 INCHES. HOWEVER...CONVECTIVE

.DISCUSSION...

THE HEAT ADVISORY HAS ALREADY VERIFIED TODAY OVER MOST AREAS WITH 
HEAT INDICES RANGING FROM 105 TO 108. ALL AREAS WILL SEE 105 PLUS 
HEAT INDICES BEFORE THE DAY IS THROUGH. SUNNY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES 
PREVAIL ACROSS THE REGION.

THE HOT TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY GET WORSE OVER THE WEEKEND AS THE 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BECOMES CENTERED OVER THE MIDSOUTH. 850MB TEMPS 
WILL RANGE FROM 22C TO 24C WHICH SUPPORTS HIGHS IN THE UPPER 90S TO 
LOWER 100S. AS HAS BEEN STATED IN PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS...WE FEEL 
THAT THE MOIST AIRMASS WILL PREVENT MOST AREAS FROM REACHING TRIPLE 
DIGITS. THE ONE EXCEPTION MIGHT BE IN THE JONESBORO AREA AS THEY ARE 
RUNNING A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN THE REST OF THE AREA. HAVE DECIDED 
TO GO AHEAD FORECAST 100 FOR THEM ON SUNDAY. REGARDLESS IF IT 
REACHES 100 OR NOT...THE HEAT INDICES WILL BE BETWEEN 105 AND 110. 
THE HEAT ADVISORY WILL CONTINUE. NO PRECIP EXPECTED OVER THE WEEKEND 
AS DRIER MIDLEVEL AIR WORKS INTO THE AREA AND SUBSIDENCE FROM THE 
UPPER RIDGE DOMINATES.

THE RIDGE AXIS WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT EAST ON MONDAY. 850 TEMPS STILL 
HANG AROUND 22C WHICH WOULD SUGGEST HIGHS REMAIN IN THE UPPER 90S 
WITH CONTINUED HEAT INDICES OF 105 PLUS. THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THE 
HEAT ADVISORY MAY NEED TO BE EXTENDED INTO MONDAY. WILL PASS ON TO 
ONCOMING SHIFTS AND A DECISION WILL BE MADE OVER THE WEEKEND 
REGARDING THIS. A MENTION WILL ALSO BE MADE IN THE HWO. 

THE EXTENDED PART OF THE FORECAST (TUE-FRI) IS NOT CLEAR CUT TO SAY 
THE LEAST. THE BIGGEST FACTOR IN THIS PART OF THE FORECAST IS HOW 
FAST AND HOW FAR SOUTH DOES A COLD FRONT FROM THE UPPER PLAINS MOVE 
INTO OUR REGION? THE GFS CONTINUES TO OFFER A FASTER 
SOLUTION...BARRELLING THE FRONT THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY 
NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING. MEANWHILE...THE ECMWF IS MUCH SLOWER AND 
HANGS THE FRONT UP OVER THE REGION BY THE END OF THE WEEK. THE UKMET 
AGREES MORE WITH THE GFS WHILE THE NOGAPS IS IN LINE WITH THE ECMWF. 
GIVEN IT IS LATE JULY...I HAVE A HARD TIME SEEING A FRONT RAPIDLY 
MOVING THROUGH OUR AREA. CLIMATOLOGY IS STRONGLY AGAINST THIS. FOR 
NOW...WILL LEAN CLOSER TO THE ECMWF SOLUTION. WILL KEEP A MENTION OF 
CHANCE POPS FROM THE MIDDLE TO THE END OF THE WEEK WITH TEMPERATURES 
NEAR SEASONABLE LEVELS. NEEDLESS TO SAY...THERE IS MUCH MORE 
UNCERTAINTY THAN USUAL REGARDING THE EXTENDED FORECAST.   

AS FOR THE TROPICS...TROPICAL STORM FRANKLIN IS FORECAST TO STAY OFF 
THE SOUTHEAST COAST AND TURN OUT TO SEA AHEAD OF AN UPPER TROUGH. 
ANOTHER AREA OF INTEREST MAY DEVELOP IN THE BAY OF CAMPECHE OVER THE 
WEEKEND...BUT SHOULD MOVE WEST AND NOT BE A FACTOR IN OUR WEATHER.

OUR AREA. THIS SUGGEST TEMPS IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S TODAY. THROW IN 
LOW TO MID 70 DEWPOINTS AND HEAT INDICES WILL CLIMB TO ABOVE 105 
THIS AFTERNOON. SOME CLOUDS REMAIN ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AS 
AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM AN OVERNIGHT MCS PUSHES THROUGH THE AREA. 
THIS MAY HELP TO TRIGGER AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM. 
ELSEWHERE...THERE SHOULD BE MORE SUN THAN CLOUDS TODAY AS MEAN RH 
VALUES CONTINUE TO GO DOWN AND SUBSIDENCE INCREASES FROM THE UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGE. CURRENT FORECAST HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON THE SITUATION AND 
NO UPDATES WILL BE ISSUED. 


JFB

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 218 AM FRI JUL 22...

UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS BEGINNING TO BUILD MORE INTO THE MIDSOUTH
FROM THE WEST...SIGNALING SEVERAL HOTTER DAYS WITH VERY LITTLE RAIN.
MOST CONVECTION ON THURSDAY WAS ACROSS SOUTHERN HALF OF AREA.
TEMPERATURES AT 06Z WERE MAINLY IN THE UPPER 70S. CONVECTION OVER KY
AND INDIANA THIS MORNING WILL REMAIN EAST OF THE MIDSOUTH AREA.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN FROM THE WEST SHOULD PUSH CONVECTION
FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST TODAY. IF THERE IS ANY CONVECTION THIS
AFTERNOON...WOULD EXPECT IT TO BE ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHEAST
PORTION OF CWA. NAM SOLUTION APPEARS TO HAVE CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK
ISSUES OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...AND WILL DISCOUNT FOR NOW. AIRMASS DRIES
OUT A LITTLE MORE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. NO PLAN TO MENTION
PRECIPITATION IN SHORT TERM AFTER THIS AFTERNOON.

TEMPERATURES...HOT. MOST AREAS FELL A DEGREE OR TWO SHORT OF
FORECAST MAXES ON THURSDAY...BUT EXPECT ABOUT A CATEGORY WORTH OF
WARMING TODAY. THIS WOULD PUT US WITHIN A DEGREE OR SO OF GOING
FORECAST AND WILL NOT SPLIT HAIRS. SIMILAR TEMPERATURES EXPECTED
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. MOST AREAS LIKELY TO STAY JUST SHORT OF
CENTURY MARK IN THE UPPER 90S...ALTHOUGH A FEW TRIPLE DIGIT HIGHS
WOULD NOT BE A SHOCK. WILL NOT SEE SIGNIFICANT RELIEF DURING THE
NIGHTTIME HOURS EITHER...WITH MOST AREAS MID AND UPPER 70S FOR LOWS.

WHEN WE BROKE THE CENTURY MARK IN JUNE IN MEMPHIS AND JONESBORO...
GROUND AND ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE LEVELS WERE LOWER...DEWPOINTS
IN MID AND UPPER 60S...ALLOWING MORE SURFACE WARMING. IF WE HAD THOSE
MOISTURE CONDITIONS THIS WEEKEND...WE WOULD PROBABLY BE LOOKING AT
HIGHS 102 TO 105 OR SO IN MEMPHIS...ESPECIALLY ON SATURDAY.

DO NOT SEE ANY INFLUX OF DRIER AIR AT THE SURFACE IN THE NEXT FEW
DAYS. EXPECT DEWPOINTS TO REMAIN IN THE MIDDLE 70S. THIS WILL KEEP
HEAT INDICES IN THE ADVISORY CATEGORY. HEAT ADVISORY TO CONTINUE AS
CURRENTLY POSTED.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER SUNDAY)...
EXPECT MONDAY WILL BE SIMILAR TO SUNDAY...BUT WILL HOLD OFF ON
EXTENDING ADVISORY INTO MONDAY FOR NOW. FRONTAL SYSTEM STILL WELL TO
THE NORTH ON MONDAY...AND PLAN TO DROP MENTION OF PRECIPITATION FOR
MONDAY. AFTER THAT...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS TRY TO DROP A FRONT INTO THE
AREA AS UPPER RIDGE MOVES EAST. THIS WILL LEAVE A WEAKNESS IN THE
UPPER PATTERN TO PROVIDE A CHANCE FOR A FROPA SOMETIME AROUND MID TO
LATE WEEK. NO CHANGES TO FORECAST POPS AFTER MONDAY. BASED ON
POSSIBLE FRONT INTO OR THROUGH THE AREA...TEMPERATURE FORECAST LOOKS
OK.

.DISCUSSION...
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS BEGINNING TO BUILD MORE INTO THE MIDSOUTH
FROM THE WEST TODAY...SIGNALING A BEGINNING TO SEVERAL HOTTER DAYS
WITH LESS IF ANY RAIN. LESS CONVECTION WAS OBSERVED THIS AFTERNOON
THAN THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS...AND THE RAIN HAS COME TO AN EARLIER
END. WILL UPDATE TO REMOVE POPS FROM THE FORECAST FOR THE REMAINDER
OF THE NIGHT. REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST IS FINE.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 245 PM CDT THU JUL 21 2005

THE DOG DAYS OF SUMMER ARE KICKING INTO HIGH GEAR ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH. MANY PLACES ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH ALREADY REPORTING HEAT
INDICES OF 105 TO 108 DEGREES. A WEAK 500MB TROUGH HAS PROMOTED
SCATTERED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPMENT...WHICH IS PROVIDING
A FEW AREAS SOME TEMPORARY HEAT RELIEF.

WILL MAINTAIN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH TO CHANCE POPS SOUTH FOR THE
EVENING HOURS. THINGS WILL SETTLE DOWN WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME
HEATING. IT WILL BE A VERY WARM AND MUGGY NIGHT WITH MID TO UPPER
70S EXPECTED FOR LOWS. COULD BE A LITTLE PATCHY FOG IN THOSE AREAS
THAT SEE RAIN...BUT IT SHOULD BE VERY ISOLATED IN NATURE.

THE FORECAST FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS IS FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD.
UPPER RIDGE CURRENTLY CENTERED OVER COLORADO WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT
EAST. 850MB TEMPS WILL INCREASE TO AROUND 22C OR 23C. THIS YIELDS
MAXIMUM HIGHS IN THE UPPER 90S TO POSSIBLE LOW 100S. GIVEN THE
RELATIVELY MOIST SOIL CONDITIONS AFTER SEVERAL DAYS OF RAIN ALONG
WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 70S...HAVE A FEELING THAT 100 MAY BE HARD TO
REACH. IT CERTAINLY CANNOT RULED OUT BUT THE MAIN POINT IS THAT HEAT
INDICES WILL STILL BE BETWEEN 105 AND 109 DEGREES REGARDLESS IF 100
IS HIT ON THE THERMOMETER. A HEAT ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR
THE ENTIRE AREA UNTIL 10PM SUNDAY.

RAIN CHANCES WILL DIMINISH GREATLY BEGINNING TOMORROW. ONLY A SLIGHT
CHANCE IN SOUTHEASTERN AREAS WHERE SOME MID LEVEL MOISTURE WILL
REMAIN. OTHERWISE...MEAN RH VALUES WILL DROP TO LEVELS THAT WILL NOT
SUPPORT CONVECTION. DRY WEATHER WILL LAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS EAST BY MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. THE CORE OF THE HEAT
WILL SHIFT WITH IT AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL RETURN TO THE
AREA. MODELS PERSISTENT IN SHOWING A FRONT APPROACHING ON WEDNESDAY
AND STALLING/WASHING OUT OVER THE AREA BY THE END OF THE WEEK. WITH
THIS IN MIND...LOW CHANCE POPS ARE WARRANTED. TEMPERATURES WILL BE
CLOSER TO SEASONABLE LEVELS AS WELL.

1031 AM CDT THU JUL 21 2005

.UPDATE...
ITS DEFINITELY GOING TO BE A HOT ONE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TODAY AND 
THERE APPEARS TO BE NO LIGHT AT THE END OF THE TUNNEL. 500MB RIDGE 
CENTERED STILL WELL TO OUR WEST WITH ITS EASTERN EXTENT NOSING INTO 
THE REGION. 850MB TEMPS OF AROUND 19C WILL PROMOTE HIGHS IN THE MID 
TO UPPER 90S. WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S...HEAT INDICES 
WILL BE BETWEEN 105 AND 107 THIS AFTERNOON...HENCE THE HEAT ADVISORY 
THAT IS IN EFFECT.

IN REGARDS TO PRECIP CHANCES...FEEL SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PORTIONS 
WILL SEE THE BEST CHANCE FOR CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. THIS IS 
WHERE THE BEST 850 MOISTURE RESIDES. IN ADDITION...A WEAK 500MB 
TROUGH AXIS WAS NOTED JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA AND THIS MAY 
SERVE AS A SUBTLE TRIGGER FOR STORMS. DUE TO WEAK WIND FIELDS AND 
HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATERS...ANY STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP WILL BE 
CAPABLE OF HEAVY RAIN. HWO AND ZONES HANDLE THIS WELL. CURRENT 
FORECAST IS GOOD AND NO UPDATES ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 344 AM THU JUL 21 2005...

SATELLITE SHOWS A SCATTERED DECK OF MID LEVEL CLOUDINESS OVER WEST 
TN AND NORTH MS THIS MORNING. THE WATER VAPOR SHOWS AN UPPER VORT 
SPINNING THROUGH SOUTHERN MISSOURI WITH A DRY PUNCH MOVING WEST TO 
EAST ACROSS ARKANSAS. THE UPPER HIGH ASSOCIATED WITH HOT WEATHER IS 
CENTERED OVER COLORADO THIS MORNING BUT WILL SLOWLY BEGIN TO EXPAND 
TOWARDS THE EAST. 

FORECAST REMAINS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED. BOTH GFS AND NAM SHOW 
850-500MB MOISTURE STILL REMAINS OVER MUCH OF THE REGION BUT SHOULD 
BEGIN TO LESSEN SOMEWHAT OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS AND WEST TN AS THE 
DRIER WORKS IN FROM THE WEST. MODEL SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO SHOW A 
RELATIVELY UNCAPPED ATMOSPHERE AREAWIDE. SO STILL EXPECT SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS TODAY BUT THE COVERAGE MAY BE LESS NORTH OF THE TN/MS 
BORDER DUE TO THE LESSER MOISTURE. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AND 
WEAK STORM MOTION OF AROUND 5 KTS STILL SUGGEST A HEAVY RAIN/FLASH 
FLOOD THREAT TODAY. GUSTY TO MARGINALLY SEVERE WINDS ALSO POSSIBLE 
DUE TO WET MICROBURSTS. ONLY MENTIONING THESE THREATS IN THE HIGHER 
POP AREAS. THE OTHER STORY IS THE HEAT. THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN 
TO NOSE INTO THE AREA TODAY AND HIGH TEMPS WILL BEGIN TO CLIMB INTO 
THE MID 90S FOR HIGHS AS 850 MB TEMPS RISE TO NEAR +20. SURFACE DEW 
POINTS HAVE NOT BEEN DROPPING MUCH OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF 
AFTERNOONS AS THEY HAD BACK IN JUNE. AS A RESULT...LOW TO MID 70S 
DEW POINTS TRANSLATES INTO HEAT INDICIES OF 105-108 OR SO. THUS THE 
HEAT ADVISORY. 

ON FRIDAY...THE CENTER OF THE UPPER HIGH SHOULD MOVE INTO EASTERN 
KANSAS. THE FLOW AROUND THIS HIGH WILL PUSH A WIND SHIFT THROUGH THE 
REGION DURING THE LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON. TYPICALLY...THIS WOULD 
BE CLASSIFIED AS A COLD FRONT BUT TEMPS ARE NOT GOING TO BE COLDER 
BEHIND THE FRONT. IN ANY CASE...THIS WILL SCOUR OUT THE REMAINING 
DEEPER MOISTURE FROM THE AREA AND SET THE STAGE FOR THE HOT 
TEMPERATURES. AFTERNOON CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN AHEAD OF THIS 
TROUGH AND IN AN ISOLATED/SCATTERED FASHION. THE NAM DOES FOR SOME 
REASON IS HANGING THE CENTER OF THE HIGH BACK WEST THROUGH THE 
ENTIRE RUN WHILE GFS/EUROPEAN/UKMET ALL BRING IT EASTWARD AND ALL 
ARE RELATIVELY SIMILAR IN THEIR POSITIONING. AM DISREGARDING THE NAM 
SOLUTION SINCE IT IS THE OUTLIER. AS A RESULT...GFS 850 MB TEMPS 
WILL RANGE FROM +20 TO +22 WHICH SUPPORTS HIGHS IN THE UPPER 90S TO 
AROUND 100 DEGREES. SOME MIXING CAN BE EXPECTED BEHIND THE 
FRONT...BUT STILL IF DEW POINTS ONLY FALL TO THE LOWER 70S THIS WILL 
PRODUCE HEAT INDICIES IN THE 105-110 RANGE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
INTERPOLATING HIGH TEMPS DOWN WITH FULL SUN WOULD PLACE AFTERNOON 
SURFACE HIGHS IN THE LOWER 100S. CU DEVELOPMENT ALTHOUGH POSSIBLE 
MAY ONLY IMPACT THE HIGH TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO. IF MAV DEW POINTS 
VERIFY WITH 100 DEGREE TEMPS AND MID 70 DEW POINTS...IT IS VERY 
CONCEIVABLE THAT HEAT INDICIES COULD BE ABOVE 110 PERHAPS NEARING 
115. AT WHICH POINT THE ADVISORY WOULD NEED TO BE UPGRADED TO A HEAT 
WARNING. AT THIS POINT...GUT FEELING IS THAT THERE WILL BE SOME 
MIXING DOWN OF DRIER AIR AND THAT THOSE DEW POINTS WILL REMAIN IN 
THE LOWER 70S DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 

SAME STORY PRETTY MUCH THROUGH THE WEEKEND. AS THE UPPER HIGH MOVES 
OVERHEAD...MID LEVEL CAPPING AND LOW MOISTURE CONTENT THROUGH THE 
COLUMN SHOULD PREVENT CONVECTION FROM DEVELOPING. BY MONDAY 
AFTERNOON THE HIGH SHOULD BE POSITIONED JUST FAR ENOUGH EAST THAT A 
RETURN OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND A WEAKENING OF THE CAP MAY RESULT 
IN AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM OR TWO. ALSO...THE CORE HEAT WILL HAVE 
SHIFTED AWAY FROM THE REGION. BETTER CHANCES FOR SCATTERED HEAT OF 
THE DAY THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE INCREASES THROUGHOUT THE REGION.

LITTLE CHANGE TO CONDITIONS THE WEATHER PATTERN AND HENCE FORECAST 
SINCE YESTERDAY. SATELLITE SHOWS A SCATTERED TO BROKEN DECK OF MID 
AND HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE AREA WITH A DECK OF LOWER STRATUS BEGINNING 
TO FORM OVER WESTERN TENNESSEE. THERE REMAINS A WEAK UPPER TROUGH 
STRETCHING FROM TEXAS THROUGH EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND THROUGH ARKANSAS. 
MEANWHILE THERE IS A POSITIVE AREA OF VORTICITY OVER CENTRAL 
MISSISSIPPI. AN UPPER RIDGE IS OVER THE CONTINENTAL DIVIDE AND 
SHOULD BEGIN TO PUSH INTO THE PLAINS TODAY. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH 
PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN US WITH SOUTH TO 
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS OVER THE MIDSOUTH. SURFACE DEW POINTS ARE IN THE 
LOWER 70S AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY STILL SHOWS A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE AROUND. THE 850-500MB RH FIELD CONFIRMS THIS. EXPECT AREAS 
TO START OUT PARTLY CLOUDY OR BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY DEPENDING UPON 
JUST WHERE THE STRATUS DECK SETS UP. ETA SOUNDINGS ARE NEARLY 
IDENTICAL TO YESTERDAY WITH GOOD INSTABILITY OF AROUND -5 ON LI AND 
CAPES 2500-3000 J/KG. PRECIPITABLE WATERS ARE STILL IN EXCESS OF 2 
INCHES (2.15). AS A RESULT...EXPECT NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS TO FIRE 
ONCE AGAIN IN THE LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON HEATING AREAWIDE. 
0-3KM STORM MOTION IS ONLY PROJECTED TO BE ABOUT 3 KTS WHICH 
TRANSLATES INTO A LOCAL FLASH FLOODING THREAT. WITH THE INSTABILITY 
AS HIGH AS IT IS...GUSTY WINDS FROM THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE AS 
WELL. MAV GUIDANCE GENERALLY FAIRED WELL YESTERDAY AND SEE NO 
JUSTIFICATION FOR DEVIATING FROM IT MUCH TODAY. 

CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET DUE TO LOSS OF 
DAYTIME HEATING. NO SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS EXPECTED SO JUST LOW CHANCES 
TONIGHT TO COVER SPILL OVER FROM AFTERNOON ACTIVITY. 

UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO NOSE INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS ON THURSDAY. 
BOTH GFS AND ETA SHOWING THE DEEPER MOISTURE BEING PUSHED SOUTHWARD 
AS THE RIDGE MOVES IN. HAVE REMOVED POPS FROM NORTHEAST ARKANSAS FOR 
THURSDAY AND BELIEVE THAT MOST OF THE CONVECTION SHOULD BE IN 
NORTHERN MS. THIS RIDGE HAS BEEN ASSOCIATED WITH EXTREME HEAT OVER 
THE SOUTHWESTERN US AND IT WILL BRING A TASTE OF THAT HEAT HERE. 
TEMPS ON THURSDAY WILL WARM INTO THE MID TO UPPER 90S AS 850 MB 
TEMPS RISE TO NEAR +20. THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION 
ON FRIDAY. FAVOR THE GFS SOLUTION WHICH SHUNS ANY OVERNIGHT MCS 
DEVELOPMENT NORTH AND EAST OF THE REGION. SOUNDINGS LOOK TOO DRY

WILL CLIMB TO AROUND +22 BY SATURDAY WHICH FITS WITH HIGHS NEAR 100 
GOING INTO THE WEEKEND. ASSUMING DEW POINTS IN THE LOW 70S THIS

ANOTHER ROUND OF THUNDERSTORMS WITH HEAVY RAIN IS COMING TO AN END
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH THIS EVENING. SATELLITE AND RADAR INDICATES MOST
OF THE CONVECTION HAS ENDED ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH...AND WHAT IS LEFT
IS CONTINUING TO DIMINISH. THERE ARE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS MOVING
INTO EXTREME SOUTHWEST KY...THESE ARE WEAKENING BUT MAY MOVE INTO
PARTS OF NORTHWEST TN / MO BOOTHEEL IF THEY HOLD TOGETHER. 00Z LZK
SOUNDING INDICATES A VERY MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE MIDSOUTH WITH A
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE OF 2.04 INCHES. WILL LEAVE IN A 30
PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS / THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
NIGHT...AS WILL NOT TAKE MUCH OF A WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE TO
TRIGGER A SHOWER / THUNDERSTORM. RAIN HAS COOLED TEMPERATURES A

SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS FORMED LATE THIS MORNING IN WEST TENNESSEE
ALONG THE TENNESSEE RIVER. THESE THUNDERSTORMS EXTENDED NORTHEAST
INTO CENTRAL AND EAST TENNESSEE. ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS HAVE SINCE
FIRED FARTHER SOUTH ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. BACK TO
THE WEST THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED AS WELL.

A LARGE SCALE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE HAS ANCHORED ITSELF ACROSS THE
WESTERN U.S. THIS HAS PRODUCED RECORD HEAT ACROSS THE DESERT
SOUTHWEST. AS A RESULT...THE FLOW OVER THE MID SOUTH REGION HAS BEEN
WEAK. THIS HAS CAUSED THUNDERSTORMS TO MOVE VERY SLOW AND PRODUCE
LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. WITH A WEAK BOUNDARY IN THE AREA AND A NARROW
BAND OF MID/UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE...THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO
AFFECT THE REGION.

EXPECT MOST AREAS TO SEE A CHANCE OF RAIN THIS AFTERNOON AND THROUGH
THE NIGHT. BY WEDNESDAY...THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LIKELY FOR MOST
LOCATIONS...ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERNOON. DAYTIME HIGH TEMPERATURES
WILL BE SIMILAR TO TEMPS TODAY. THE CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL SLOWLY
COME TO AN END BY SATURDAY. THIS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO THE UPPER
LEVEL RIDGE OUT WEST...BUILDING FARTHER EAST. AS IT APPROACHES THE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN TO THE UPPER 90S TO NEAR
100. HEAT INDICES BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON WILL BEGIN TO REACH DANGEROUS
LEVELS. THE HEAT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

BE POSSIBLE. LOOK FOR AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS TO RETURN TO THE

WEATHER FEATURES THIS MORNING INCLUDE A SURFACE FRONT THAT EXTENDS 
FROM NORTHWEST INDIANA THROUGH EAST CENTRAL MISSOURI AND INTO 
SOUTHWEST KANSAS. THIS FRONT IS SLOWING ITS SOUTHWARD PROGRESS AND 
IS EXPECTED TO BECOME STATIONARY ACROSS SOUTHERN MISSOURI THIS 
MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE IS LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN US. THERE IS 
AN UPPER TROUGH THAT EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL TEXAS THROUGH EASTERN 
OKLAHOMA AND INTO NORTHERN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. RADAR HAS SHOWN 
CONVECTION ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS INTO NORTHWEST TENNESSEE MOVING 
EASTWARD IN RESPONSE TO A VORT MAX MOVING OUT OF THIS TROUGH. NEARLY 
STATIONARY THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER SOUTHWEST MISSOURI IN 
THE VICINITY OF THE STATIONARY FRONT. MEANWHILE...SMALLER CELLS HAVE 
DEVELOPED OVER NORTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS IN RESPONSE TO THE TROUGH AXIS 
AND ARE MOVING EASTWARD. RUC ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF NEGATIVE 
VORTICITY OVER MUCH OF NORTH MS AND SOUTHWEST TENNESSEE WHICH HAS 
PREVENTED MOST OF THE STRATUS FROM FORMING OVER THIS AREA. AN AREA 
OF POSITIVE VORTICITY EXIST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF MS.

SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE POSSIBLE TODAY. THE 
BETTER CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS INTO NORTHWEST 
TENNESSEE WHERE SMALL VORT MAXS ARE EXPECTED TO EJECT OUT OF THE 
TROUGH AXIS AT VIRTUALLY ANYTIME. STILL THERE SHOULD BE SOME DRY 
TIME WITH A FEW BREAKS OF SUN THERE. POPS TAIL OFF FROM MEMPHIS TO 
JACKSON AND SOUTHWARD DUE TO POSITIONING WITH RESPECT TO HOW THE 
UPPER TROUGH IS ALIGNED. HERE DEVELOPMENT IS MORE LIKELY TO BE HEAT 
OF THE DAY GENERATED. WAS TEMPTED TO FORECAST 30 PERCENT FROM 
CLARKSDALE TO TUPELO AND SOUTHWARD BUT THE ETA SHOWS THE VORT MAX 
OVER SOUTHERN MS BECOMING MORE ALIGNED NORTHWARD WHICH MAY AID AREAL 
COVERAGE HERE. THERE IS A FLASH FLOODING POTENTIAL TODAY WITH ETA 
AND GFS SHOWING PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES OF AROUND 2.15 INCHES AND 
A STORM MOTION OF ABOUT 6 KTS. THIS COULD POSSIBLY INDICATE STORMS 
WITH LITTLE MOVEMENT YET DUMPING A LOT OF WATER. HIGH TEMPS WILL BE 
LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE THE AREA GETS TODAY. 
MAV TEMPS ARE NOT UNREASONABLE IF THE AREA GETS JUST A FEW HOURS OF 
SUN TODAY...OTHERWISE UPPER 80S TO AROUND 90 WILL OCCUR. 

CONVECTION SHOULD GREATLY DIMINISH TONIGHT ONCE THE SOLAR HEATING 
COMPONENT IS LOST. AT THIS TIME...THE MODELS SHOW NO REAL 
SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS OR VORT MAXS MOVING THROUGH. CONVECTION SHOULD 
REFIRE AGAIN TOMORROW WITH SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCES FROM THE TN/MS 
LINE NORTHWARD AS THE UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE NORTHWESTERLY IN 
RESPONSE TO THE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN US BUILDING INTO THE 
REGION AND THE TROUGH AXIS GRADUALLY SLIDES SOUTHWARD. ONCE AGAIN NO 
SIGNIFICANT VORT MAXS SEEN COMING OUT OF THIS TROUGH. CONVECTION 
SHOULD ONCE AGAIN DIMINISH TOMORROW NIGHT ONCE THE SUN SETS. ON 
THURSDAY THE UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO NOSE INTO THE REGION. SUBSIDENCE 
FROM THIS RIDGE WILL RESULT IN SLIGHTLY LOWER CHANCES ACROSS 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. OTHERWISE...CONVECTION SHOULD BE LARGELY 
DIURNALLY DRIVEN. WILL BEGIN TO SEE AN INCREASE IN TEMPS WITH MID 
90S POSSIBLE AS 850 TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO DRAW CLOSER TO +20. 

GOING INTO THE WEEKEND LOOKS REALLY HOT. THE NEW MEX NUMBERS DO NOT 
LOOK TOO UNREASONABLE. ALL MODELS SHOWING THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDING 
OVER THE REGION BRINGING WITH IT 850 TEMPS IN EXCESS OF +20. IF THE 
GFS VERIFIES WITH 850 TEMPS OF AROUND +23...LOW 100S ARE NOT OUT OF 
THE QUESTION. AM CONCERNED WITH AMOUNT OF CU DEVELOPMENT AND SFC DEW 
POINTS WITH RESPECT TO RECENT RAINFALL. THIS IS LIKELY THE ONLY 
FACTORS THAT COULD HOLD THE REGION IN THE UPPER 90S. STILL HEAT 
INDICIES WILL LIKELY BE AT LEAST AROUND 105 IF NOT BETWEEN 105 AND 
110. THIS HEAT WILL LIKELY HOLD AT LEAST MONDAY WHEN THE GFS SHOWS 
THE RIDGE AXIS MOVING EASTWARD TAKING THE CORE OF THE HEAT WITH IT.

NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OVER THE
MID-SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON AND MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE AREA.
THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS VERY MOIST (PRECIPITABLE WATERS AT OR ABOVE 2
INCHES) AND IS BECOMING INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE AS AFTERNOON HEATING
CONTINUES. ANY OF THE THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING HEAVY RAINFALL AMOUNTS...AND
POSSIBLE FLASH FLOODING...ESPECIALLY WHERE STORMS TRAIN ACROSS THE
SAME AREAS. OVERALL CONVECTIVE COVERAGE WILL DIMINISH LATER TONIGHT
WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. THERE WILL STILL BE SOME CHANCES
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AFTER MIDNIGHT...AS THE AIRMASS WILL
CONTINUE TO REMAIN VERY MOIST AND A WEAKENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS
WILL REMAIN ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH.

A BERMUDA HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM POSITIONED OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S.
THIS AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY BUILD WESTWARD OVER THE AREA
THROUGH MONDAY. THE AIRMASS WILL REMAIN VERY MOIST OVER THE REGION
ON MONDAY AND WITH ONLY LIMITED SUBSIDENCE OVER THE AREA...EXPECT
SCATTERED AIRMASS THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ONCE AGAIN ON MONDAY.
HEAVY RAIN WILL ONCE AGAIN BE POSSIBLE WITH ANY STORMS THAT
DEVELOP. THE OVERALL COVERAGE WILL BE LESS ON MONDAY THOUGH AS THERE
WILL BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER HEIGHTS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE BUILDING
BERMUDA HIGH. THIS FEATURE WILL HELP TO REPLACE THE PERSISTENT
WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE REGION THIS WEEKEND.

BY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THAT IS
CURRENTLY MOVING EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES TODAY WILL
HELP TO SEND A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE MID-SOUTH BY MONDAY NIGHT.
MODELS ARE CURRENTLY INDICATING THAT THE FRONT WILL STALL OUT JUST
TO OUR NORTH...AND THIS MAKES SENSE SINCE THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BE
LIFTING UP INTO SOUTHEAST CANADA AND THE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE
SOUTHEAST U.S. WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN. DUE TO THE CLOSE
PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT THOUGH...AND POSSIBLE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES
MOVING SOUTH INTO OUR AREA FROM CONVECTION THAT SHOULD DEVELOP ALONG
THE FRONT TO OUR NORTH...HAVE KEPT POPS IN THE HIGH CHANCE RANGE FOR
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.

FOR THE EXTENDED...A STRONG UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE WESTERN
STATES FOR THE MIDDLE AND END OF THE WEEK. THIS WILL LEAVE SLIGHTLY
LOWER HEIGHTS OVER OUR AREA THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK...WHICH
WILL ALLOW FOR A CONTINUED CHANCE FOR MAINLY DIURNAL THUNDERSTORMS
THROUGH FRIDAY...ALTHOUGH LOWER CHANCES THAN THOSE SEEN DURING THE
BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. THE UPPER RIDGE WILL EVENTUALLY SPILL
EASTWARD OVER THE MID-SOUTH NEXT WEEKEND...WITH INCREASING HEIGHTS.
THIS WILL BRING AN END TO THE DAILY THUNDERSTORM CHANCES AND ALSO
ALLOW FOR AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURES. SO NEXT WEEKEND SHOULD BE
RATHER HOT AND CONTINUED HUMID WITH LITTLE CHANCES FOR RAIN.

ANOTHER DAY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH...
WITH NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED OVER THE AREA WITH
AGAIN A HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL WITH STORMS THAT TRAIN OVER THE SAME
AREAS FOR SEVERAL HOURS. LOOKING AT REGIONAL 12Z SOUNDINGS
(LZK/JAN/OHX)...ALL SITES SHOWING VERY MOIST PROFILES AND
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES NEAR OR IN EXCESS OF 2 INCHES. ANOTHER
INTERESTING FEATURE TO NOTE THAT HAS INCREASED MY CONFIDENCE IN
INCREASED AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE COVERAGE AND PUSHED ME TO INCREASE
POPS...WAS ENHANCED LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE ALONG A SUBTLE SURFACE
BOUNDARY THAT HAS SET UP ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL ARKANSAS INTO NORTH
MISSISSIPPI THIS MORNING. SOUTHWESTERLY SURFACE WINDS WERE OBSERVED
NORTH OF THIS BOUNDARY...WITH SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS TO THE SOUTH. IN
ADDITION...CONVECTION IS NOW BUILDING ALONG THE BOUNDARY OVER SOUTH-
CENTRAL ARKANSAS AS NOTED FROM THE KLZK RADAR IN LITTLE ROCK. ALSO...
PERSISTENT UPPER TROUGH REMAINS STRETCHED ACROSS NORTHWESTERN

THIS. ALL OTHER WEATHER PARAMETERS LOOK ON TRACK...SO NO OTHER
CHANGES MADE.

THREAT...WITH TRAINING THUNDERSTORMS...ALONG THE LOW-LEVEL

SFC PRES TROF HAS MOVED NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.  THUNDERSTORMS 
SCATTERED ACROSS THE REGION. HEAVY RAIN IS BECOMING MORE BRIEF WITH 
CELLS MOVING NORTHEAST AT 15 TO 20 MPH.  

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)
WITHOUT ANY FEATURE TO ANCHOR THE THUNDERSTORMS THE THREAT FOR 
WIDESPREAD FLASH FLOODING IS DIMINISHED.  PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 
ARE IMPRESSIVE...SO IF THUNDERSTORMS CAN TEMPORARILY ANCHOR ON A 
MESOSCALE BOUNDARY THEN FLASH FLOODING PSBL.  CANNOT DETERMINE WHERE 
THAT COULD BE AT THIS TIME...THEREFORE WILL NOT ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH 
FOR FLASH FLOODING.  DIURNAL TREND SHOULD RESULT IN A WEAKENING OF 
TSTMS BY MID EVENING.

BERMUDA HIGH BUILDS INTO THE REGION ON SUNDAY.  STILL A LOT OF LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE WITH DIURNAL CONVECTION ANTICIPATED...HOWEVER WITH 
SOME SUBSIDENCE THANKS TO THE SFC HI...TSTMS SHOULD BE MORE 
SCATTERED THAN IN RECENT DAYS.  

.LONGER TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)
ECMWF AND GFS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH A SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS 
THE GRTLKS STATES MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY.  THIS WILL PUSH A 
CDFNT INTO THE OH VLY OVERNIGHT MONDAY.  THE FRONT BECOMES 
STATIONARY ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF OUR SERVICE AREA ON TUESDAY.  
THIS SHOULD HELP THE POSSIBILITY FOR TSTMS FROM MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY.  

FOR DAYS 4 THROUGH 7 (WED/SAT) THERE IS A DISCREPANCY IN THE 
MODELS.  THE GFS GOES INTO A MORE ZONAL FLOW WHILE THE ECMWF LINGERS 
A UPPER TROF ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH.  TEND TO FAVOR THE ECMWF SOLUTION 
SINCE BOTH MODELS HAVE A BUILDING UPR RIDGE ACROSS THE WESTERN 
STATES.  THIS WOULD FAVOR LOWER HEIGHTS OVER THE SOUTHEAST US.  AS A 
RESULT...LEANING TOWARD SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS AND A BETTER CHANCE 
FOR TSTMS.  WITH GREATER CLOUDS AND SLIGHT COOLER TEMPS FCST DURING 
THIS PERIOD...THE HEAT INDEX SHOULD REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY LEVELS.

TODAY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH...ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHEASTERN
2/3RDS. THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING.

SHOWERS SHOULD FORM FARTHER NORTH SUNDAY MORNING SINCE THE
BERMUDA HIGH WILL BACKBUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH. AM EXPECTING
ANOTHER ROUND OF TRWS MAINLY DURING THE DAY AND EARLY EVENING.

AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS WILL FORM MONDAY...BUT A
FRONT WILL FALL INTO THE AREA LATER MONDAY NIGHT AND CONCENTRATE
SHOWERS IN THE MIDSOUTH AGAIN TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.

FAVORED TIME FOR SHOWERS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE DURING AFTERNOON AND

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPED ALONG A TROUGH AXIS SITUATED 
ROUGHLY FROM THE NORTHEAST CWA TO THE SOUTHWEST CWA...BISECTING THE 
MEMPHIS METRO AREA. SEVERAL CONVERGING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES CAME 
TOGETHER OVER SOUTHERN SHELBY COUNTY LATE THIS AFTERNOON. THE WEAK 
FLOW ALOFT CAUSED THE THUNDERSTORMS WITH VERY HEAVY RAIN TO MOVE 
VERY LITTLE. THIS CAUSED FLASH FLOODING TO OCCUR OVER SHELBY COUNTY. 

THEN THE SLOW MOVING AXIS BEGAN TO SHOW DEVELOPING STORMS OVER LEE 
COUNTY ARKANSAS WHICH WAS EXHIBITING SIMILAR BEHAVIOR TO THE SHELBY 
COUNTY STORMS...HOWEVER IT WAS LACKING THE CONVERGING OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES. THESE STORMS DID NOT LAST NEAR AS LONG...THEREFORE NOT 
AS MUCH RAIN FELL OVER LEE COUNTY.

THE STORM OVER SOUTHERN SHELBY COUNTY BEGAN TO SPREAD INTO NORTHERN 
DESOTO COUNTY WHICH PROMPTED THE THIRD FLASH FLOOD WARNING. A STORM 
SPOTTER NEAR HORN LAKE REPORTED AN INCH AND A HALF OF RAIN FELL IN 
ONE HALF HOUR. THE TREMENDOUS RAINFALL IN A SHORT PERIOD OF TIME 
CAUSED RESCUE WORKERS TO BEGIN PULLING THE PUBLIC FROM CARS NEAR 
AIRWAYS ROAD AND GOODMAN HIGHWAY. IN ADDITION...THE HEAVY RAIN 
CAUSED A ROOF TO COLLAPSE IN SOUTHAVEN. NO INJURIES WERE REPORTED.

OTHER STORMS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WERE MOVING MUCH QUICKER AND 
NOT PROVIDING FLASH FLOODING RAINS. ADDITIONAL LIGHT RAIN WILL 
LIKELY OCCUR OVER SHELBY AND DESOTO COUNTIES THROUGH 9 PM. THE 
HEAVIEST RAINFALL WILL PROBABLY OCCUR WHERE THE TROUGH AXIS IS 
SLOWER TO MOVE...MAINLY SOUTH OF A SENATOBIA TO NEW ALBANY LINE.

IF NEEDED...WILL UPDATE ZONE FORECAST AND GRIDS ACCORDINGLY.

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ONCE AGAIN DEVELOPED ACROSS
THE MID-SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. THIS CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED ALONG A
WEAK SURFACE TROUGH WHICH BISECTS THE REGION AND IN RESPONSE TO AN
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS ALONG WITH DAYTIME HEATING. OTHER
CONVECTION FURTHER SOUTH HAS ALSO INITIATED ALONG OLD OUTFLOW
BOUNDARIES LEFT AROUND FROM CONVECTION THAT OCCURRED EARLIER THIS
MORNING. EXPECT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE
THROUGH THIS EVENING WITH A REDUCTION IN THE OVERALL COVERAGE LATER
TONIGHT WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. ANY THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING HEAVY RAIN (HIGH PWATS)...GUSTY WINDS...AND
DANGEROUS CLOUD TO GROUND LIGHTNING. ALTHOUGH A FEW STORMS MAY BECOME
STRONG...THINK THAT MOST WILL STAY BELOW SEVERE LIMITS...ALTHOUGH
CANNOT COMPLETELY RULE OUT AN ISOLATED PULSE SEVERE STORM IN AREAS
THAT RECEIVED GOOD HEATING AND RESULTANT POCKETS OF INCREASED
INSTABILITY. TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON HAVE BEEN HELD BACK ACROSS
MOST AREAS DUE TO THE CLOUD COVER AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS.

THIS WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY...WITH THE UPPER
TROUGH AXIS REMAINING ORIENTED OVER THE AREA. EXPECT ANOTHER DAY
SIMILAR TO TODAY...WITH SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ALONG
OLD MESOSCALE SURFACE BOUNDARIES...ESPECIALLY DURING THE MAXIMUM
HEATING OF THE DAY. THINK THAT TEMPERATURES WILL REACH INTO THE UPPER
80S AGAIN ON SATURDAY...WITH WIDE RANGES IN AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES
BASED UPON WHERE ONGOING CONVECTION EXISTS. IN ADDITION...WITH A VERY
MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE AND PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES NEARING 2
INCHES...CANNOT RULE OUT A HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL WITH ANY SLOW MOVING
THUNDERSTORMS.

THE BERMUDA HIGH OFF OF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. COAST TODAY WILL BUILD
WESTWARD FOR SUNDAY AND INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL
ALLOW FOR DRIER MID LEVEL AIR TO MOVE OVER THE AREA AND WITH UPPER
LEVEL HEIGHT RISES SHOULD LEAD TO MORE SUBSIDENCE OVER THE REGION.
ALTHOUGH DIURNAL CONVECTION CANNOT BE RULED OUT FOR THE END OF THE
WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK...THE OVERALL CHANCES AND COVERAGE WILL
BE DIMINISHED.

AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH NOW MOVING INTO THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND ACROSS THE NORTHERN
PLAINS AND AMPLIFY THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL
HELP TO SEND A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT AND
TUESDAY. THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO DE-AMPLIFY BY MID-WEEK
CAUSING THE FRONT TO STALL ALONG OUR NORTHERN PERIPHERY ON TUESDAY
AND WASH OUT BY WEDNESDAY. HAVE RAISED POPS A BIT ON TUESDAY TO
ACCOUNT FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE FRONT.
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL AGAIN BUILD OVER THE AREA FOR THE END OF
NEXT WEEK WITH DRY WEATHER AND INCREASING SUMMER HEAT EXPECTED.

A WEAK SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH (REMNANTS OF DENNIS) BISECT

THE VERY MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE TO PRODUCE SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY WITH

NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND HAVE CONTINUED LIKELY POPS OVER THIS AREA.
ELSEWHERE...HAVE GONE CHANCE POPS AS DAYTIME HEATING WILL FEED THE

RULE OUT SOME BREAKS LATER THIS AFTERNOON EVEN ACROSS EASTERN

SCATTERED CONVECTION BEGINNING TO BREAK OUT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH THIS 
AFTERNOON...PRIMARILY TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF MEMPHIS. CONVECTION 
BEING SPARKED BY A PERSISTENT UPPER LEVEL WEAKNESS (PARTLY THE 
REMNANTS OF DENNIS) AND A STATIONARY SFC TROUGH STRETCHED FROM NW TN 
TO SOUTHERN AR. TEMPS HAVE WARMED INTO THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S 
UNDER A DEVELOPING CU FIELD.

CONVECTION WILL DIMINISH TONIGHT WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. 
LOWS WILL BE SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT...LOWER 70S MOST PLACES TO 
MIDDLE 70S IN THE MEMPHIS METRO.

TOMORROW APPEARS TO BE A REPEAT. ALTHOUGH GUIDANCE IS GIVING 60 TO 
70 POPS...WILL LEAVE AT 50. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE...GUIDANCE HAS BEEN 
OVERDOING POPS THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. THESE FORECASTED HIGHER POPS 
HAVE ALSO RESULTED IN GUIDANCE BEING TOO LOW ON DAYTIME HIGHS. 
THEREFORE...WILL GO ABOVE MOS ON HIGHS AND SHOULD BE CLOSE TO WHAT 
WE ARE SEEING TODAY.

BERMUDA HIGH BEGINS TO BUILD IN OVER THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL SERVE TO 
REDUCE RAIN CHANCES AND INCREASE TEMPERATURES. WILL REFLECT THIS IN 
THE GRIDS. MODEL RH FIELDS SHOW THE 850 TO 700 MB LAYER DRYING OUT 
CONSIDERABLY BY SUNDAY AND INTO MUCH OF NEXT WEEK. THIS COMBINED 
WITH AN INCREASING MID LEVEL CAP WILL REDUCE RAIN CHANCES EVEN 
FURTHER. IT WILL FEEL VERY MUCH LIKE SUMMER WITH HIGHS IN THE 90S 
AND DEWPOINTS IN THE 70S. 

OP GFS HAS CHANGED ITS TUNE ABOUT THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY DURING THE 
TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME. YESTERDAY IT TRIED TO BRING THE FRONT 
THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH AND THIS WAS MET WITH MUCH SKEPTICISM. 
NOW...THE OP GFS...GFS ENSEMBLES...AND THE ECMWF ALL AGREE THE FRONT 
WILL WASH OUT TO OUR NORTH AND WEST AS IT ENCOUNTERS THE STRONG SE 
UPPER RIDGE. THEREFORE...CURRENT EXTENDED FORECAST IS RIGHT ON TRACK.

THE CENTER OF THE REMNANTS OF DENNIS ARE NOW OVER SOUTHERN INDIANA. 
THERE IS AN ELONGATED TROUGH THAT HAS SET UP FROM THE CENTER THROUGH

THE REMNANTS OF DENNIS THE MENACE CONTINUE TO SPIN OVER THE LOWER 
OHIO VALLEY. THE CYCLONIC FLOW AROUND THIS HAS BROUGHT A VORTICITY 
MAX THROUGH OKLAHOMA THIS AFTERNOON. THE END RESULT HAS BEEN PLENTY 
OF SHOWERS TO OUR EAST AND CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT TO OUR 
WEST...LEAVING THE MIDSOUTH IN THE MIDDLE WITH VERY LITTLE COVERAGE 
EXCEPT FOR A FEW SHOWERS IN NE MS. 

WENT BELOW GUIDANCE ON POPS TONIGHT AS MUCH SHOULD NOT CHANGE IN 
REGARDS TO LIFTING MECHANISMS OVER THE REGION. SLIGHT CHANCE SHOULD 
SUFFICE. TEMPS SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT...LOWER 70S MOST PLACES WITH 
MID 70S IN THE MEMPHIS METRO.

MODELS AGREE THAT A WEAKNESS WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA FROM DENNIS 
WITH A SURFACE TROUGH REMAINING OVER THE MIDSOUTH. GUIDANCE IS 
RATHER ROBUST IN PUTTING OUT HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS FOR THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS. HAVE DECIDED TO GO A LITTLE LOWER THAN GUIDANCE. THE 
COVERAGE THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAS BEEN BELOW MODEL EXPECTATIONS. 
IN ADDITION...MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE VERY MEAGER (LESS THAN 5.5 
C/KM.) EVEN THE MODELS ARE SHOWING THE AREA REMAINING BETWEEN TWO 
VORT MAXES...VERY MUCH LIKE TODAY. TEMPS WILL BE NEAR CLIMO. 

THE BERMUDA HIGH WILL BEGIN TO SHOW ITS INFLUENCE BY SUNDAY AND INTO 
NEXT WEEK. TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY WARM AND RAIN CHANCES WILL BE 
REDUCED TO DIURNAL CONVECTION. 12Z GFS TRIES TO BRING A FRONT 
THROUGH THE AREA BY TUESDAY AS A TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE CENTRAL 
PORTION OF THE COUNTRY. A LOOK AT THE GFS ENSEMBLES GOES AGAINST 
THIS SOLUTION AND LEANS MORE TOWARD THE FRONT WASHING OUT WELL TO 
OUR WEST AS IT ENCOUNTERS THE UPPER RIDGE. WILL NOT MAKING ANY 
CHANGES...KEEPING JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR DAYS 6 AND 7. ECMWF 
ALSO IS IN LINE WITH THIS FORECAST. IT IS JUST VERY TOUGH FOR A 
FRONT TO MAKE IT THROUGH THIS PART OF THE COUNTRY IN MID JULY. AS 
ALWAYS...WILL MONITOR LATER MODEL TRENDS.

THE CENTER OF THE CIRCULATION FORMERLY KNOWN AS DENNIS IS OVER 
SOUTHWESTERN INDIANA AND IS BEGINNING TO SLOW ITS EASTWARD 
PROGRESSION. SATELLITE HAS SHOWN A BAND OF LOW AND MID LEVEL 
CLOUDINESS EXTENDING FROM THE CENTER THROUGH WESTERN TENNESSEE AND 
THROUGH NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. THERE IS AN AREA OF POSITIVE VORTICITY 
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CLOUDS AND A BAND OF RAIN SHOWERS HAS MOVED 
THROUGH THIS AREA AS WELL. SATELLITE TRENDS HAVE SHOWN THE WESTERN 
EXTENT OF THESE CLOUDS THINNING SOMEWHAT AS THE WESTERN PORTION OF 
THE UPPER VORT WEAKENS. BASED UPON THESE TRENDS EXPECT PORTIONS OF 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND SOUTHWEST TENNESSEE TO BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY 
TODAY IF THEY DONT START OUT THAT WAY. CLOUD COVER WILL LIKELY HOLD 
TOUGH AGAIN OVER MUCH OF NORTHWEST TENNESSEE. BETTER CHANCES FOR 
RAIN WILL BE IN THIS AREA AS WELL DUE TO PROXIMITY TO UPPER VORT. 
ELSEWHERE...CHANCES WILL BE MAINLY HEAT OF THE DAY DRIVEN ALTHOUGH 
THE PRESENCE OF THE UPPER VORT MAY SLIGHTLY INFLUENCE DEVELOPMENT 
OVER NORTHWEST MS LATER THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON. INSTABILITY 
LOOKS MORE IMPRESSIVE FROM MEMPHIS SOUTHWARDS SO HAVE REMOVED 
THUNDER WORDING ACROSS NORTHWEST TENNESSEE INTO THE BOOTHEEL AND 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS.

NOT MUCH CHANGES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. A SECONDARY VORT MAX IS 
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER NORTHEAST TEXAS TONIGHT. AS A RESULT AN 
AREA OF UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SHOULD DEVELOP FROM THE REMNANTS OF 
DENNIS TO THIS SECONDARY VORT MAX. THIS MAY BE A BETTER FOCUS FOR 
RAIN CHANCES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AS THE REMNANTS BEGIN TO 
RETROGRADE BACK TOWARDS MISSOURI AND LOW LEVEL WINDS BECOME MORE 
SOUTHERLY AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH WHICH WILL PUMP ADDITIONAL LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. 

TOWARDS EARLY NEXT WEEK A BERMUDA HIGH WILL GRADUALLY SLIDE INTO THE 
REGION BUT THIS WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT UPON THE WEATHER. MAY SEE A 
BIT MORE SUNSHINE BUT THREAT FOR RAIN WILL STILL BE AROUND DUE TO

AROUND JACKSON. THE BETTER RAIN CHANCES WILL BE TOWARDS THE BOOTHEEL 
AND INTO NORTHWEST TENNESSEE WHERE RADAR SHOWS RAIN ABOUT TO MOVE 
INTO THAT REGION. CLOUDS AND RAIN WILL KEEP THIS AREA COOL ONCE 
AGAIN. SOUTH OF THIS AREA...OVER EAST CENTRAL ARKANSAS INTO 
SOUTHWEST TENNESSEE AND ROUGHLY THE FIRST COUPLE ROWS OF COUNTIES IN 
MISSISSIPPI...EXPECT CU DEVELOPMENT TODAY ALTHOUGH UNCERTAIN AS TO 
THE EXTENT. GUT FEELING IS THAT PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS WILL BE 
EXPECTED. MOST AREAS HERE SHOULD REMAIN DRY ALTHOUGH AM CONCERNED 
ABOUT POP UP THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON IN THE HEATING OF THE DAY 
(WITH HIGHS POTENTIALLY AROUND 90) AND THE PROXIMITY TO THE REMNANTS 
PROVIDING ADDITIONAL LIFT.  SOUTH OF OXFORD AND TUPELO...THIS 
TENTACLE OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL RESULT IN SLIGHTLY BETTER 
CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS TODAY AS IS ALREADY THE CASE. 

DENNIS SHOULD STALL OVER SOUTHWEST INDIANA ON TUESDAY AND BEGIN TO 
RETROGRADE BACK TOWARDS MISSOURI TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK AS A 
BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN US BEGINS TO SLIDE WESTWARD. RAIN 
CHANCES PAST TODAY ARE LARGELY DUE TO OUR PROXIMITY TO THE REMNANTS. 
FURTHERMORE...CLOUDS WILL LIKELY BE SLOW TO BUDGE OVER NORTHWEST TN 
INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS UNTIL THE SYSTEM WEAKENS ENOUGH THAT THE SUN 
CAN FINALLY BURN THROUGH. THIS WOULD BE POSSIBLY WEDNESDAY OR 
THURSDAY BUT NO GUARANTEES HERE. TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY WILL BEGIN 
TO RISE ONCE AGAIN AS SOUTHERLY WINDS RETURN TO THE ENTIRE AREA BY 
MIDWEEK.

THIS MORNING PIECES OF DENNIS WERE MOVING ACROSS PARTS OF THE MID 
SOUTH REGION AFFECTING ALL OF NORTH MISSISSIPPI AND MOST OF WEST 
TENNESSEE. WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH DENNIS HAVE CAUSED SOME TREE DAMAGE 
IN TUPELO EARLY THIS MORNING. WIND SPEEDS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY COMING 
DOWN IN TUPELO WITH WINDS SUSTAINED AT 25 MPH GUSTING TO 32 MPH 
WHICH IS DOWN FROM A COUPLE OF HOURS AGO WHEN WINDS WERE SUSTAINED 
AT 29 MPH WITH GUSTS NEAR 40 MPH.

RAINFALL RATES HAVE BEEN MUCH LESS THAN ANTICIPATED THE PAST FEW 
NIGHTS. THE BULK OF THE RAINFALL HAS OCCURRED OVER ALABAMA. WITH THE 
RAIN ENDING A LITTLE SOONER OVER NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI BY LATE THIS 
MORNING...EXPECT AT MOST ABOUT TWO MORE INCHES BEFORE LETTING UP. 
WILL CANCEL OUR FLOOD WATCH TODAY.

THE WIND ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE CANCELED BY MID DAY IF NOT SOONER 
FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

THE INLAND TROPICAL STORM WARNING WILL ALSO BE CANCELLED THIS 
MORNING. 

DENNIS WILL MOVE INTO SOUTHERN ILLINOIS/MISSOURI AND THEN LINGER IN 
THIS GENERAL VICINITY THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. THUS CHANCES FOR 
RAIN WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE REGION. ONE FEATURE NOTED WAS A 
SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING OVER THE RIDGE ANCHORED OVER THE WEST/CENTRAL 
U.S. THIS WAVE GETS GETS INGESTED INTO THE UPPER LOW OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY. BY WEDNESDAY THIS WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
INCREASING THE CHANCES FOR RAIN. IN RESPONSE A WEAK BOUNDARY IS 
LIKELY TO FORM ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI PUTTING THE MAIN FOCUS OF 
HEAVIEST RAINFALL TO OCCUR THERE LATE THIS WEEK.

COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO INCREASE FROM SOUTHEAST TO
NORTHWEST THROUGH THE DAY. HAVE BUMPED POPS UP A BIT TO ACCOUNT

BAY THIS MORNING. SOME OUTER BANDS OF CLOUDS FROM DENNIS HAVE MOVED 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE LAST NIGHT. ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER FROM 
DENNIS WILL FLOW INTO THE AREA TODAY.

SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP TODAY. THE BULK OF THE 
RAINFALL WILL OCCUR LATER TONIGHT. AS DENNIS TRACKS INTO CENTRAL 
MISSISSIPPI LATE TONIGHT...WIND PROFILES WILL SUPPORT THE CHANCE FOR 
TORNADIC ACTIVITY. IN ADDITION STRONG WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH DENNIS 
WILL ALSO AFFECT THE REGION. SOME TREE DAMAGE...MINOR ROOF DAMAGE 
AND POSSIBLY DOWNED POWER LINES WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT AND 
MONDAY.

REMNANTS OF DENNIS WILL BRING SOME MUCH NEEDED RAINFALL TO THE

DANGEROUS. THUS THE FLOOD WATCH WILL CONTINUE FOR THE REGION. THE 
INLAND TROPICAL WIND STORM WATCH HAS BEEN EXTENDED FARTHER NORTH AND 
WEST WHICH WILL INCLUDE THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA. 

THE RAINFALL WILL PERSIST ALL DAY MONDAY AND MOST LIKELY INTO MONDAY 
NIGHT AS THE SURFACE WINDS SLOWLY RELAX. AS DENNIS WEAKENS IT 
APPEARS IT WILL STALL OUT OVER SOUTHERN MISSOURI TUESDAY NIGHT. IT

AND HAVE ADDED HEADLINES TO BOTTOM OF THIS DISCUSSION...

.DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH CONTINUES TO INTERACT WITH INCREASING LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED
SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON. EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO BE POSSIBLE THROUGH
TONIGHT AS THE UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO RETROGRADE NORTHWESTWARD
IN ADVANCE OF THE OUTER FLOW FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANE DENNIS.

AFTER TONIGHT THE MAIN PLAYER TO AFFECT THE WEATHER ACROSS THE MID-
SOUTH WILL BE STRENGTHENING HURRICANE DENNIS. THE HURRICANE HAS
BECOME MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON AND IS SHOWING A MUCH
IMPROVED SATELLITE PRESENTATION AS IT CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHWEST
ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE STRENGTHENING THROUGH TONIGHT AND IS FORECAST TO LEVEL OFF
JUST PRIOR TO LANDFALL...BUT STILL FORECAST AS AT LEAST A MAJOR
CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE...MOST LIKELY BETWEEN THE MISSISSIPPI COAST AND
THE WESTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING.

MOST OF THE TROPICAL AND GLOBAL MODELS HAVE CONTINUED TO CLUSTER
ALONG THE EAST CENTRAL GULF COAST IN REGARDS TO LANDFALL LOCATION AND
THEN MOVE THE HURRICANE REMNANTS INTO THE MID-SOUTH FOR SUNDAY NIGHT
CONTINUING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. EXPECTING WITH THIS ANTICIPATED
TRACK TO EXPERIENCE HEAVY FLOODING RAINS (4-8 POSSIBLE LOCALLY
HIGHER)...STRONG WINDS (30-50 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS POSSIBLE)...AND
POSSIBLE SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS EASTERN AREAS (POSSIBLE ISOLATED
TORNADOES AND DAMAGING THUNDERSTORM WIND GUSTS OVER PORTIONS OF
WEST TENNESSEE & NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI). HAVE ISSUED FLOOD WATCHES
FOR THE ENTIRE AREA...INLAND TROPICAL STORM WATCH FOR NORTHEAST
MISSISSIPPI AND EXTREME SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE COUNTIES...AND A WIND
ADVISORY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA FROM MIDNIGHT MONDAY MORNING
UNTIL 7 PM MONDAY. THE REMNANT STORM SYSTEM SHOULD SLOW DOWN AS IT
GETS UNDER AN UPPER RIDGE BY MONDAY NIGHT AND THEN SLOWLY MOVE EAST
THROUGH MID WEEK...AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE NORTHWEST U.S.
MOVES EAST AND CAPTURES THE STORM REMNANTS. SO GOOD CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH POSSIBLE HEAVY RAINS CONTINUING
THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK.

ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE HAS INCREASED QUITE A BIT TODAY ON THE
EXPECTED TRACK...PLEASE STAY TUNED TO THE LATEST UPDATES AND EVENTUAL
IMPACTS TO THE MID-SOUTH.

LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED
SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON. EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO BE POSSIBLE THROUGH
TONIGHT AS THE UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO RETROGRADE NORTHWESTWARD
IN ADVANCE OF THE OUTER FLOW FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH HURRICANE DENNIS.

AFTER TONIGHT THE MAIN PLAYER TO AFFECT THE WEATHER ACROSS THE MID-
SOUTH WILL BE STRENGTHENING HURRICANE DENNIS. THE HURRICANE HAS
BECOME MUCH BETTER ORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON AND IS SHOWING A MUCH
IMPROVED SATELLITE PRESENTATION AS IT CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHWEST
ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO
CONTINUE STRENGTHENING THROUGH TONIGHT AND IS FORECAST TO LEVEL OFF
JUST PRIOR TO LANDFALL...BUT STILL FORECAST AS AT LEAST A MAJOR
CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE...MOST LIKELY BETWEEN THE MISSISSIPPI COAST AND
THE WESTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING.

MOST OF THE TROPICAL AND GLOBAL MODELS HAVE CONTINUED TO CLUSTER
ALONG THE EAST CENTRAL GULF COAST IN REGARDS TO LANDFALL LOCATION AND
THEN MOVE THE HURRICANE REMNANTS INTO THE MID-SOUTH FOR SUNDAY NIGHT
CONTINUING THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. EXPECTING WITH THIS ANTICIPATED
TRACK TO EXPERIENCE HEAVY FLOODING RAINS (4-8 POSSIBLE LOCALLY
HIGHER)...STRONG WINDS (30-50 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS POSSIBLE)...AND
POSSIBLE SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS EASTERN AREAS (POSSIBLE ISOLATED
TORNADOES AND DAMAGING THUNDERSTORM WIND GUSTS OVER PORTIONS OF
WEST TENNESSEE & NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI). HAVE ISSUED FLOOD WATCHES
FOR THE ENTIRE AREA...INLAND TROPICAL STORM WATCH FOR NORTHEAST
MISSISSIPPI AND EXTREME SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE COUNTIES...AND A WIND
ADVISORY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA FROM MIDNIGHT MONDAY MORNING
UNTIL 7 PM MONDAY. THE REMNANT STORM SYSTEM SHOULD SLOW DOWN AS IT
GETS UNDER AN UPPER RIDGE BY MONDAY NIGHT AND THEN SLOWLY MOVE EAST
THROUGH MID WEEK...AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE NORTHWEST U.S.
MOVES EAST AND CAPTURES THE STORM REMNANTS. SO GOOD CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH POSSIBLE HEAVY RAINS CONTINUING
THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK.

ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE HAS INCREASED QUITE A BIT TODAY ON THE
EXPECTED TRACK...PLEASE STAY TUNED TO THE LATEST UPDATES AND EVENTUAL
IMPACTS TO THE MID-SOUTH.

A PERSISTENT UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS REMAINS STRETCHED ACROSS THE
MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING. THIS UPPER LEVEL FEATURE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR
THE INCREASED CLOUD COVER OVER THE AREA THIS MORNING AND MAY HELP
TO INITIATE ISOLATED CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON AS THE TROUGH AXIS
RETROGRADES NORTHWESTWARD. REGIONAL 12Z SOUNDINGS AND LOCAL FORECAST
SOUNDINGS SHOW THE THAT THE AIRMASS WILL BE UNCAPPED BY THIS
AFTERNOON AND WITH INCREASED HEATING AND INSTABILITY THE AIRMASS WILL
SUPPORT AT LEAST ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AS FOR
TEMPERATURES...CLOUDS WILL ONLY LIMIT TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY AND GOING
TEMPERATURE FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK.

ALL OTHER PARAMETERS LOOK FINE AS WELL AND WILL ONLY MAKE UPDATES
TO EXPAND THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO INCLUDE THE ENTIRE AREA. UPDATED
GRIDS ALREADY SENT AND UPDATED ZONE FORECAST OUT SHORTLY.

AS A SIDE NOTE...HURRICANE DENNIS STILL ON TRACK TO MAKE LANDFALL
ALONG THE EAST-CENTRAL GULF COAST ON SUNDAY AND CONFIDENCE IS
CONTINUING TO INCREASE THAT THERE WILL BE SOME IMPACTS FROM THIS
SYSTEM HERE IN THE MID-SOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. MUCH

ALL EYES ARE ON HURRICANE DENNIS TODAY. THE MID SOUTH WILL HAVE 
UNTIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY NIGHT TO PREPARE FOR THIS RAINY 
AND WINDY EVENT. 

IN THE MEANTIME...A SHEAR AXIS EXTENDED FROM NORTH-CENTRAL 
MISSISSIPPI TO SOUTHWESTERN LOUISIANA IN ASSOCIATION WITH A WEAK 
DISTURBANCE NEAR HOUSTON TEXAS. THIS FEATURE CAN BE SEEN ON IR AND 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. MID LEVEL CLOUDS HAVE FORMED ON THE EAST SIDE  
OF THE SHEAR AXIS. ENOUGH HEATING COULD AND LIFT COULD GENERATE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SOME ISOLATED THUNDER AND SHOWERS MAINLY ACROSS 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTHWEST TENNESSEE THROUGH THE DAY AND 
INTO TONIGHT. DAYTIME TEMPERATURES MAY BE SLIGHTLY HINDERED BY 
THICKER CIRRUS...MUCH LIKE YESTERDAY. HOWEVER...LOWER TO MID 90S IS 
STILL QUITE WARM DESPITE THE CLOUD COVER

THE MAIN FEATURE AS MENTIONED EARLIER WILL BE REMNANTS OF DENNIS 
MOVING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. APPEARS MORE AND MORE LIKE HEAVY RAIN 
AND WINDS ABOVE 30 MPH WILL BE LIKELY ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI. THE RAIN WILL SPREAD OVER WEST TENNESSEE...NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL MONDAY. MOST LOCATIONS WILL SEE 
RAIN WHICH WILL HOPEFULLY PUT A HALT TO THE CURRENT DROUGHT 
SITUATION OVER THE MID SOUTH. HAVE INCREASED RAIN CHANCES SUNDAY  
AND MONDAY DUE TO CONTINUED HIGHER CONFIDENCE IN THE TRACK OF DENNIS.

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH REMAINS STRETCHED ACROSS CENTRAL TO
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI THIS AFTERNOON AND HAS TRIGGERED SOME
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI THIS
AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES IN MOST AREAS RANGED FROM THE UPPER 80S TO
LOWER 90S AREAWIDE. WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...EXPECT ANY
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI TO DIMINISH.

ON SATURDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH TO THE SOUTH WILL WEAKEN AS IT MOVES
NORTH DURING THE DAY. CANNOT COMPLETELY RULE OUT AN ISOLATED SHOWER
OR THUNDERSTORM ON SATURDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF
OF THE AREA WHERE BETTER MOISTURE EXISTS...BUT COVERAGE WILL BE LOW
ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE IT FROM THE FORECAST. TEMPERATURES SHOULD AGAIN BE
SEASONABLY HOT ON SATURDAY.

THE MAJOR STORY THIS AFTERNOON CONTINUES TO BE WHAT HAPPENS WITH
DANGEROUS HURRICANE DENNIS OVER THE WEEKEND AND ITS POSSIBLE
IMPACTS TO THE MID-SOUTH AT THE END OF THE WEEKEND AND BEGINNING OF
NEXT WEEK. MOST OF THE FORECAST MODELS HAVE COME INTO MUCH BETTER
AGREEMENT TODAY AND HAVE CLUSTERED ALONG A TRACK THAT SENDS THE
HURRICANE NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO...MAKES LANDFALL
IN THE VICINITY OF THE EAST-CENTRAL GULF COAST ON SUNDAY...AND THEN
SENDS THE REMNANTS IN THE DIRECTION OF THE MID-SOUTH FOR THE
BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. IN FACT...MOST OF THE MODELS NOW SHOW THE
WEAKENING SYSTEM MOVING OVER SOME PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA
DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. AS WITH ANY TROPICAL SYSTEM THAT IS STILL A
COUPLE OF DAYS OUT...ERRORS CAN STILL BE QUITE LARGE. BUT WITH THE
MODELS STARTING TO CONVERGE ON A SOLUTION...CONFIDENCE IS
INCREASING THAT THERE WILL BE SOME IMPACTS...POSSIBLY SIGNIFICANT...
ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH FROM LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY NIGHT. SOME OF THE POSSIBLE THREATS WILL INCLUDE THE
POSSIBILITY OF FLOODING RAINFALL...STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS...AND
POSSIBLE SEVERE WEATHER...MAINLY TO THE EAST OF WHERE THE CENTER OF
THE STORM TRACKS. THE GREATEST IMPACTS FROM INCLEMENT WEATHER AT THIS
TIME APPEARS TO BE ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF OUR FORECAST AREA.
AGAIN...THIS FORECAST IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS UP UNTIL AND BEYOND LANDFALL.

AS FOR SOME OF THE METEOROLOGY THAT MAY DIRECT THE REMNANT LOW INTO
THE MID-SOUTH...INCLUDES THE PERSISTENT MID AND UPPER LEVEL SUB-
TROPICAL RIDGE THAT STILL EXTENDS ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA INTO
THE EASTERN GULF AND THE NORTHEAST U.S. UPPER TROUGH. THE STORM
SHOULD BE GUIDED NORTHWEST AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE...FORCING IT TO MAKE LANDFALL ALONG THE EAST-CENTRAL GULF
COAST. AFTER THAT IT SHOULD MOVE INLAND AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE
NORTHWEST AND SLOW DOWN AS IT APPROACHES OUR AREA. THIS NORTHWEST
TRAJECTORY SHOULD CONTINUE INLAND...AS IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE
FORECAST MODELS ARE LIFTING THE NORTHEAST U.S. TROUGH OUT TO THE
NORTHEAST AND LEAVING THE REMNANTS OF DENNIS BEHIND AND UNDER A
BUILDING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE. THIS IS WHY THE SYSTEM SHOULD
EVENTUALLY SLOW DOWN ITS MOVEMENT. WITH THE SYSTEM SIGNIFICANTLY
WEAKENING...BUT POSSIBLY STILL LINGERING ACROSS SOME PORTION OF THE
AREA...WILL CONTINUE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH
THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW
NORMAL THROUGH MID WEEK WITH THE RAIN AND CLOUDS...BUT SLOWLY WARMING
THROUGH THE END OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

JUST TO REITERATE...THE EXTENDED PORTION OF THE FORECAST IS SUBJECT
TO CHANGE...SO STAY TUNED TO THE LATEST UPDATES ON THE EVENTUAL TRACK
AND INTENSITY OF DENNIS AND POSSIBLE IMPACTS TO THE MID-SOUTH.

AN UPPER TROUGH AXIS EXTENDED FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO SOUTHEAST

CLOUDS WERE STREAMING ACROSS ARKANSAS...LOUISIANA...TENNESSEE...
MISSOURI AND MISSISSIPPI. HURRICANE DENNIS WAS A CATEGORY 4 
HURRICANE PRODUCING WINDS AROUND 135 MPH EARLIER TONIGHT NEAR CUBA.

ONLY A FEW MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO ONGOING FORECAST THIS MORNING. TODAY 
WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN YESTERDAY AND REMAIN DRY FOR MOST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. OVERNIGHT LOWS RANGE FROM THE MID 60S TO LOWER 
70S TONIGHT AND SATURDAY NIGHT. DAYTIME HIGHS ON SATURDAY WILL BE 
NEAR TODAY/S HIGHS. ON SUNDAY...EASTERN AREAS SHOULD BE COOLER WITH 
HURRICANE DENNIS AND ITS ASSOCIATED CLOUD COVER SEEPING INTO THE MID 
SOUTH. 

FEEL THAT CIRRUS CLOUDS STREAMING ACROSS THE REGION TODAY WILL BE 
THIN ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR PLENTY OF INSOLATION. THUS MAX TEMPS 
REACHING THE LOW TO MID 90S SEEM REASONABLE.

THE MAIN WEATHER CHALLENGE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE LOCATION OF WHERE 
DENNIS MAKES LANDFALL AND HOW MUCH OF DENNIS WILL IMPACT THE MID 
SOUTH. WITH MORE CONFIDENCE EACH DAY...HAVE INCREASED RAIN CHANCES 
IN ASSOCIATION WITH DENNIS FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT. IT APPEARS THAT SHOULD DENNIS FOLLOW THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST

A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH CONTINUES TO PUSH EASTWARD ACROSS THE MID-
SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. REGIONAL 88D RADARS STILL SHOWING MAINLY
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER MAINLY NORTHEAST
MISSISSIPPI. TEMPERATURES RANGED FROM THE UPPER 80S TO LOW 90S
AREAWIDE...WITH THE COOLER TEMPERATURES BEING OBSERVED OVER AREAS
WITH RAINFALL. EXPECT THIS SHORTWAVE TO CONTINUE MOVING SLOWLY
SOUTHEAST TONIGHT...BRINGING AN END TO ANY LINGERING SHOWERS.

HIGH PRESSURE ALONG WITH RISING HEIGHTS WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA ON
FRIDAY AND PERSIST INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL
BRING DRY WEATHER AND SEASONABLY HOT TEMPERATURES THROUGH SATURDAY.

THE BIG STORY FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE POSSIBLE IMPACTS FROM
REMNANTS OF HURRICANE DENNIS. CURRENTLY DENNIS IS SCOOTING JUST TO
THE NORTH OF JAMAICA AS A MAJOR CATEGORY 3 HURRICANE. THERE HAVE
BEEN SOME INCONSISTENCIES IN THE MODEL TRENDS WITH REGARDS TO
FORECAST TRACK OF THE SYSTEM. MOST OF THE MODEL GUIDANCE HAS
SHIFTED TO THE EAST THIS MORNING AS COMPARED WITH YESTERDAYS
GUIDANCE. OF COURSE THE EVENTUAL TRACK OF THE SYSTEM WILL MAKE A BIG
DIFFERENCE ON POSSIBLE IMPACTS TO THE AREA. THE 12Z RUNS OF THE
GFDL/GFS AND 18Z RUN OF THE BAMM HAVE SHIFTED FURTHER EAST...WITH
LANDFALL ESTIMATES IN THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. IF THIS WERE TO OCCUR...
THE GREATEST THREATS OF HEAVY RAIN AND SEVERE WEATHER WOULD LIKELY
REMAIN EAST OF THE AREA...WITH JUST OUTER BANDS ON THE WESTERN SIDE
OF THE SYSTEM IMPACTING OUR AREA. THE 12Z RUNS OF THE UKMET/ECMWF
REMAINED FURTHER WEST WITH POSSIBLE LANDFALL ALONG THE LOUISIANA OR
MISSISSIPPI GULF COAST...AND HAVING A MORE SIGNIFICANT RAIN AND
POSSIBLE SEVERE THREAT TO THE MID-SOUTH. LOOKING AT WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON...MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC RIDGING
WHICH IS CURRENTLY STEERING THE SYSTEM REMAINS ENTRENCHED ACROSS
THE PENINSULA OF FLORIDA...WITH EASTERLY FLOW EXTENDING INTO THE
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THIS SHOULD KEEP THE SYSTEM ON ITS GENERAL
NORTHWEST OR WEST NORTHWEST HEADING FOR THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. UPPER
LEVEL TROUGHING WAS NOTED ACROSS THE NORTHWEST GULF AND IT IS THE
STRENGTH OF THIS FEATURE WHICH WILL MOST LIKELY DETERMINE THE
ULTIMATE PATH OF DENNIS...AND HOW FAR WEST IT TRACKS.

WITH ALL THIS BEING SAID...THERE IS STILL QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY
WITH THE EVENTUAL TRACK OF THE SYSTEM AND THERE ARE LIKELY TO BE
SOME CHANGES TO THE FORECAST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND BEYOND. PREFER
TO REMAIN SOMEWHAT CONSISTENT WITH THE GOING FORECAST AND ONLY MADE
MINOR CHANGES TO POPS IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD. AS WE GET CLOSER TO
THE EVENT...IMPACTS TO THE FORECAST AREA WILL BECOME BETTER DEFINED.
BUT AT THIS TIME...STILL THINK A PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL
HAVE AT LEAST THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS AND HAVE
INCLUDED THIS IN THE FORECAST FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND BEYOND.

FORECAST CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE WILL BE RESIDUAL PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES FOR THIS MORNING AND UPCOMING TROPICAL WEATHER AFFECTING THE 
FORECAST AREA BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. 

TODAY...THE REMNANTS OF TROPICAL STORM CINDY WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE 
EAST TOWARD THE APPALACIANS. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO 
SWING THROUGH THE LOWER/MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
DO INDICATE SOME INSTABILITY WITH 700-500MB LAYER LAPSE RATES AROUND 
6 C/KM DURING THE MORNING. RECENT 88D TRENDS SHOW SOME LIGHT RETURNS 
JUST BEGINNING TO ENTER THE SW SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS A 
RESULT WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED SHOWER FROM AREAS ALONG AND 
SOUTH OF A LINE FROM FORREST CITY TO SAVANNAH WITH SHOWER ACTIVITY 
COMING TO AN END BY THIS AFTERNOON. 15KT 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 18C 
MIXING DOWN TO THE SURFACE WILL SUPPORT HIGHS AROUND 90 BUT SOME 
RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE PRESENT MAY KEEP TEMPERATURES DOWN A 
DEGREE OR TWO. 

TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEPART AS RIDGING 
BUILDS IN ACROSS THE REGION. SOME CLEARING WILL TAKE PLACE ACROSS 
THE AREA...ESPECIALLY ACROSS AREAS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
WHERE MOISTURE WILL MIX OUT DURING THE DAYTIME AND DECOUPLING WINDS 
WILL ALLOW LOWS TO DROP BACK INTO THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S. 
TEMPERATURES THROUGH SATURDAY WILL BE NEAR NORMAL VALUES.

SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH THE TRACK OF 
HURRICANE DENNIS. MADE ONLY SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS UPWARD ON POPS FOR 
EARLY NEXT WEEK AS LONG RANGE MODELS HAVING DIFFICULTY RESOLVING 
SOLUTIONS BEYOND LANDFALL. NONETHELESS...HURRICANE DENNIS SHOULD MAKE 
LANDFALL SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE PANHANDLE OF 
FLORIDA TO JUST EAST OF HOUSTON. ONCE IT MAKES 
LANDFALL...GFS/EUROPEAN SOLUTION TAKE THE REMNANTS ACROSS THE 
MIDSOUTH AND EVENTUALLY WEST ACROSS OKLAHOMA. THE 18Z DGEX SOLUTION

THESE RAIN CHANCES WILL DIMINISH LATER TONIGHT...AS THE REMNANTS OF

ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY...BUT
WITH THE AIRMASS BECOMING MUCH DRIER...NOT EXPECTING MORE THAN A
FEW CLOUDS WITH THIS SYSTEM. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BUILD OVER THE
MID-SOUTH BEGINNING FRIDAY AND CONTINUING THROUGH MOST OF THE
WEEKEND. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A RETURN TO DRY AND SEASONABLY HOT
WEATHER FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY.

THE EXTENDED PORTION OF THE FORECAST WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON
THE EVENTUAL TRACK OF WHAT IS EXPECTED TO BE HURRICANE DENNIS. THIS
PORTION OF THE FORECAST WILL CARRY MUCH UNCERTAINTY...BUT CURRENT
INDICATIONS ARE THAT DENNIS WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF
OF MEXICO BY SATURDAY MORNING AND IMPACT SOME PORTION OF EITHER THE
CENTRAL OR EASTERN GULF COAST BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK AS
POSSIBLY A MAJOR HURRICANE.

THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THIS TROPICAL SYSTEM WILL AFFECT SOME
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
TIME PERIOD. IF THE SYSTEM WERE TO TRACK JUST TO OUR WEST...AS
INDICATED BY SOME OF THE MEDIUM RANGE GUIDANCE...THERE WOULD BE THE
POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING RAINS...SEVERE WEATHER...AND STRONG WINDS
ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH. IF THE SYSTEM TRACKS FAR ENOUGH
AWAY FROM THE AREA...ONLY TYPICAL SUMMER WEATHER (HOT AND MAINLY DRY)
WOULD BE EXPECTED UNDER UPPER LEVEL RIDGING. THIS SYSTEM IS SEVERAL
DAYS AWAY AND THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF TIME TO REFINE THE ULTIMATE
STRENGTH AND TRACK. THEREFORE...HAVE DECIDED TO INCLUDE CHANCE POPS
INTO THE EXTENDED FORECAST TO ACCOUNT FOR POSSIBLE TROPICAL IMPACTS.

.DISCUSSION...
SURFACE FRONT BISECTS THE AREA ROUGHLY ALONG THE TN/MS BORDER. 
SCT-NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN UNSTABLE AIRMASS SOUTH 
OF THE FRONT ACRS NRN MS. THOUGH INSTABILITY IS DECENT WITH CAPES 
AROUND 2500 J/KG...UPPER LEVEL WINDS AND LAPSE RATES ARE MARGINAL. A 
FEW STORMS HAVE APPROACHED SEVERE LIMITS BUT THE MAIN THREAT WL BE 
HEAVY RAIN AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING. PRECIP H20 VALUES GREATER THAN 2 
INCHES AND SLOW STORM MOVEMENT MAY RESULT IN HEAVY RAIN TOTALS IN 
AREAS THAT DO EXPERIENCE THUNDERSTORMS. WL MENTION HEAVY RAIN THREAT 
EARLY THIS EVENING. EXPECT STORMS TO DIMINISH WITH LOSS OF HEATING. 
HOWEVER SOME REDEVELOPMENT POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT AS WEAK SHORTWAVE 
MOVES INTO THE REGION FROM THE NORTHWEST. 

TROPICAL STORM CINDY WL PROBABLY NOT IMPACT THE MID SOUTH MUCH. 
MODELS AND HPC TRACK INDICATE MOST OF THE PRECIP IMPACTS WITH THIS 
SYSTEM WL STAY ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. ON WED SFC FRONT 
WL BE HUNG UP OVER NORTHERN MS WHILE CINDY TRACKS TO THE SRN MS/AL 
BORDER BY 00Z THU. EXPECT SCT TSTMS DEVELOPMENT ACRS NE MS WHILE 
DRIER AIR ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THE SYSTEM WORKS INTO NW SXNS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. WED NIGHT CINDY TRACKS INTO CNTRL AL AND PRECIP 
CHANCES WL DIMINISH ACRS NE MS. MEANWHILE DRY SINKS OVER EVEN MORE 
OF THE CWFA. 

THU THROUGH WEEKEND...HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL OF THE REGION WITH A 
LESS HUMID NORTHEAST WIND PREVAILING THROUGH THE PERIOD. TEMPS WILL 
BE SEASONABLY WARM. EARLY NEXT WEEK STARTED TO ADD POPS TO ACCOUNT 
FOR POSSIBILITY OF TS DENNIS IMPACTING THE REGION.

.DISCUSSION...

A COUPLE AREAS OF CONVECTION TO DEAL WITH THIS AFTERNOON. FIRST 
BATCH DEVELOPED ACRS NE MS IN RESPONSE TO A WEAK SHORTWAVE AND 
SOME SFC CONVERGENCE IN AN AREA OF STRONG INSTABILITY WITH CAPES 
AROUND 3000 J/KG. A FEW OF THESE STORMS HAVE BEEN SEVERE WITH PENNY 
SIZE HAIL AND DAMAGING WIND. THIS STORMS WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN BY 
EVENING. 

THE NEXT AREA OF CONCERN IS NE AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL. AN OLD 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY THAT WAS GENERATED BY AN MCS EARLIER TODAY IS 
MOVING INTO NE AR ATTM. THE AIRMASS ACRS NE AR HAS DESTABILIZED 
RAPIDLY THIS AFTN AS HIGH DEWPOINTS...73 AT JBR... HAVE SURGED NORTH 
AND TEMPS HAVE BUMPED TEMPS INTO THE MID 90S. THE LATEST LAPS 
ANALYSIS INDICATES CAPES GREATER THAN 4000 J/KG. MEANWHILE A DECENT 
SHORTWAVE WAS MOVING ACRS MO WITH SOME STRONGER MID LEVEL WINDS. 
STORMS HAVE ALREADY STARTED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY 
AND WITH NO CAP ACRS NE AR EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE INTO THE 
EVENING HOURS. A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH IS IN EFFECT UNTIL 7 PM 
ACRS NE AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL. THE MAIN THREATS WILL BE LARGE HAIL 
AND DAMAGING WINDS. 

THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA LATER TONIGHT SO MORE 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL BE POSSIBLE. SEVERE POTENTIAL WL 
DIMINISH SOME AS THE EVENING WEARS AND SFC HEATING WINDS DOWN. SFC 
FRONT WL BE STALLED ACRS THE REGION ON TUESDAY. WL BUMP UP POPS A 
LITTLE...TO 50 PERCENT...ACRS THE SRN 2/3RDS OF THE AREA WITH HIGH 
TEMPS A LITTLE COOLER DUE TO CLOUDS AND PRECIP. 

WL BEGIN TO TAPER POPS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ON TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE 
FRONT SLOWLY PUSHES SOUTHWARD. THE FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED NEAR THE 
SRN EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 12Z WED. WL GO WITH A DRY FORECAST 
ACRS NRN HALF WED AND WED NIGHT WITH SMALL POPS ACRS NRN MS WITH 
WEAK FRONT IN THE AREA. 

BY THU GFS DEPICTS A SFC WAVE DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT HELPING TO 
DRAG THE FRONT SOUTH OF THE AREA AND SFC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING OVER 
THE AREA. THIS SOLUTION SEEMS REASONABLE AND HAS SHOWN SOME 
CONSISTENCY OVER THE PAST FEW MODELS RUN. EXPECT DRY AND SEASONABLY 
WARM WEATHER THU THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

.UPDATE...
15Z SFC ANALYSIS INDICATES THE SFC FRONT FROM HELENA THROUGH MEMPHIS 
TO JUST SOUTH OF JACKSON TN. THIS FRONT SHOULD NOT MOVE MUCH TODAY. 
SOUTH OF THE FRONT AIRMASS BECOMING UNSTABLE WITH SFC CAPES ALREADY 
1500-2000 J/KG. HOWEVER THERE IS A GOOD DEAL OF CLOUD COVER ACRS THE 
REGION AND THIS MAY INHIBIT DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTN. NOT MUCH UPPER 
SUPPORT TODAY AND LAPSE RATES ARE LESS THAN 6 C/KM SO EXPECT ANY 
CONVECTION TO BE PULSE IN NATURE AND MOST LIKELY NOT SEVERE. WL 
DECREASE POPS ACRS NE MS SINCE MORNING ACTIVITY JUST ABOUT OUT OF 
THE AREA OTRW ISOLD-SCT SHOWERS/TSTMS EXPECTED...MORE NUMEROUS 
TOWARD SRN SXNS. TWEAKED TEMPS A BIT FOR THIS AFTN.

MADE A SMALL CHANGE FOR TONIGHT...EXPECT THE FRONT TO REMAIN NEARLY 
STATIONARY. ETA SHOWING A SHORTWAVE MOVING INTO THE REGION WITH SOME 
PRECIP DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE FRONT. WENT AHEAD AND MOVED POPS A 
LITTLE FURTHER NORTH INTO THE MEMPHIS AREA. WL CONT TO LOOK AT THIS 
FOR THE AFTN PACKAGE.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 415 AM...
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD FRONT FROM NEAR JONESBORO TO 
BACK ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND INTO THE ARKLATEX. CONVECTION FROM 
LAST EVENING ALMOST COMPLETELY OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA.

TODAY...COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE THROUGH A PORTION OF THE MID 
SOUTH DURING THE DAY. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SURFACE BASED CAPES OF 
2500 J/KG...LI/S AROUND -6...AND RELATIVELY WEAK WINDS ALOFT WILL 
SUPPORT MAINLY PULSE TYPE CONVECTION...THOUGH MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES 
WILL BE POOR AROUND 5 C/KM. BOTH NAM/GFS SIMILAR WITH TIMING OF 
FRONT. WILL MONITOR TRENDS THIS MORNING AND ISSUE AN UPDATE TO TRIM 
POPS IF FRONT MAKES SOME PROGRESS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

TONIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY AS A SECONDARY 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS ACROSS EASTERN TEXAS AND MOVES EAST. 
WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES IN 
FORECAST AREA WITH TAPERING POPS OFF TOWARDS THE TN/MS BORDER.

WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...FORECAST BECOMES A BIT TRICKY ACROSS THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. TROPICAL DEPRESSION NUMBER 3 /CURRENTLY 
LOCATED ACROSS THE CENTER OF THE GULF OF MEXICO/ WILL MOVE INLAND 
AROUND THE MOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI. NAM/GFS BOTH HAVE SLIGHTLY 
DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS ON THE TRACK OF THE LOW AS IT MOVES ACROSS 
MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA. THE NAM TAKES A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK ACROSS 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI WHILE THE GFS HAS A NORTHEASTERLY TRAJECTORY 
ASSOCIATED WITH IT. WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE GFS SOLUTION AND TPC 
GUIDANCE FOR THE TRACK OF THE TROPICAL LOW. WILL ONLY CARRY 20 POPS 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND NOT 
CARRY ANY POPS ON THURSDAY. BEYOND THURSDAY...AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BRINGING PRECIPITATION 
FREE WEATHER TO THE MID SOUTH INTO THE WEEKEND.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING PLACES COLD FRONT FROM WESTERN 
LAKE SUPERIOR BACK INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. WATER VAPOR/INFRARED 
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS CONVECTIVE COMPLEX ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS 
INTO THE MISSOURI VALLEY. 00Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS FROM LAST EVENING 
SHOWS 850 MB RIDGING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH BUT A WEAK 500 MB TROUGH

FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE WILL BE CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. 00Z GFS HAS SOME CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK 
ISSUES IN THE SHORT TERM AND WILL LEAN FORECAST TOWARDS NAM SOLUTION.

TODAY...LOW LEVEL RIDGING IN PLACE WILL MOVE EAST AS COLD FRONT 
SLOWLY MOVES TOWARD THE MID SOUTH. MAIN FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR ANY 
CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL WILL BE DIURNAL INSTABILITY AS WIND FLOW ALOFT 
IS WEAK WITH AREA BETWEEN SYSTEMS. A MODIFIED SURFACE BASED PARCEL 
ON MODEL SOUNDINGS (96/66) PRODUCES 1700 J/KG SURFACE BASED 
CAPE...AND LI/S AROUND -4. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1.75 
INCHES SUGGEST HEAVY RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH ANY ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP BY LATE AFTERNOON. FREEZING LEVELS WILL 
BE AROUND 15KFT...SO ANY SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WOULD MAINLY BE 
DOWNBURST WINDS. DEBRIS CLOUD ASSOCIATED WITH COMPLEX ALREADY 
STARTING TO AFFECT THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA AND TWEAKED 
DOWN HIGHS SLIGHTLY THIS AFTERNOON TO ACCOUNT FOR MORE CLOUD COVER.

TONIGHT...500MB SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE REFLECTION WILL 
MOVE THROUGH THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. SURFACE LOW ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS WILL MOVE INTO EAST CENTRAL MISSOURI/WEST CENTRAL 
ILLINOIS...DRAGGING A TRAILING COLD FRONT WITH IT. A 60 KT UPPER

WITH DOWNBURST WINDS AS THE POTENTIAL SEVERE WEATHER THREAT. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ALONG THE FRONT AROUND 2 INCHES SUGGEST 
HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL MAY BE POSSIBLE WITH THE THUNDERSTORMS.

OUT OF THE AREA BY 00Z WEDNESDAY WHILE GFS HOLDS ONTO RAINFALL UNTIL

ANOTHER QUIET NIGHT WEATHERWISE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. SOME MID AND
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ARE SPREADING ACROSS MAINLY THE SOUTHEAST CORNER
OF THE MIDSOUTH IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. OVERALL...
TODAY WILL BE ANOTHER HOT DAY WITH LITTLE IF ANY RAIN...POPS TOO LOW
TO MENTION IN THE ZONE FORECASTS. MEAN ATMOSPHERIC RELATIVE HUMIDITY
VALUES WILL REMAIN LOW. CAN NOT TOTALLY RULE OUT AN ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORM AROUND TUPELO SOUTHWARD WHERE THE MOISTURE IS FORECAST
TO BE SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN ELSEWHERE...BUT THE CHANCE APPEARS TOO
SLIM TO MENTION IN THE FORECAST. MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB NEAR
OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDANCE VALUES WITH DROUGHT CONDITIONS CONTINUING.

LITTLE CHANGE IS SEEN FOR JULY 4TH DURING THE DAY. MOISTURE WILL
INCREASE SOME AND CAN NOT RULE OUT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER...
WITH THE BERMUDA HIGH FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN
UNITED STATES BY MONDAY WILL LEAVE OUT ANY CHANCE OF RAIN DURING THE
DAY MONDAY. HEAT INDEX READINGS WILL CLIMB TO NEAR 105 MONDAY
AFTERNOON FROM AROUND MEMPHIS SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER DELTA.

CHANGES WILL TAKE PLACE MONDAY NIGHT OFFERING A CHANCE FOR SOME
RAIN...AND A LITTLE COOLER TEMPERATURES. MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD
AGREEMENT THAT THE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVING
INTO THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTHWEST MONDAY NIGHT. THE NAM
INDICATES A DECENT SHORT WAVE APPROACHING FROM THE WEST WHICH WILL
HELP TO INITIATE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. A FEW OF THE THUNDERSTORMS
COULD BE STRONG TO SEVERE FROM NORTHEAST ARKANSAS INTO PART OF WEST
TENNESSEE MONDAY EVENING WITH DAMAGING WIND AND LARGE HAIL BEING THE
MAIN THREATS.

THE COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO STALL WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH TUESDAY INTO THE MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK. THE NAM AND GFS
DIFFER ON EXACT PLACEMENT OF THE FRONT. NEVERTHELESS...THE FRONT WILL
BE IN THE VICINITY CONTINUING TO GIVE THE MIDSOUTH A CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS.

A QUIET NIGHT WEATHERWISE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. ONLY PATCHY MID AND
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ARE BEING OBSERVED ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH
SPOTTY FOG. LIGHT NORTHEAST WINDS ARE FEEDING IN SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR
AT THE SURFACE. ALSO THE WATER VAPOR SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES DRY
AIR AT THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS SPREADING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH FROM
THE WEST.

THE WEAK COLD FRONT THAT MOVED INTO THE MIDSOUTH LAST NIGHT HAS
JUST ABOUT WASHED OUT AND IS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE. REMNANTS OF THE
FRONT WILL LIE ACROSS SOUTHERN PARTS OF NORTH MS THIS AFTERNOON.
WILL LEAVE IN A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS FOR
THAT PART OF NORTHEAST MS GENERALLY NEAR TUPELO AND SOUTHWARD.
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON COMBINED WITH
CLOSENESS OF THE FRONT INDICATE MARGINAL CONDITIONS FOR ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE SHORT TERM. MEAN ATMOSPHERIC
RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES WILL BE LOW ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT
INTO INDEPENDENCE DAY. THUS A CONTINUED FORECAST OF NO RAIN STILL
LOOKS GOOD. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE REBOUND SUNDAY AND MONDAY
WITH H5 HEIGHTS INCREASING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. 850 MB TEMPERATURES
ARE FORECAST BY THE NAM TO CLIMB TO AROUND 22 DEGREES C MONDAY
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE MIDSOUTH. WE INCREASED THE
FORECAST MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES A LITTLE FOR MONDAY...BUT THIS STILL
MAY NOT BE HIGH ENOUGH CONSIDERING THE DROUGHT CONDITIONS WE ARE
IN. IF HIGHS NEED TO BE INCREASED FURTHER FOR JULY 4TH...THEN HEAT
INDEX VALUES COULD CLIMB TO AROUND 105 FOR PARTS OF THE AREA...SO
THIS WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED CLOSELY.

MODELS ARE INDICATING THE RIDGING WEAKENING SOME OVER THE MIDSOUTH
TUESDAY AND BEYOND WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE AREA FROM
THE NORTH. HOWEVER...THE 00Z NAM WAS HOLDING THE RIDGE STRONGER
OVER THE MIDSOUTH THAN THE GFS. ATTM...WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS. WILL BE KEEPING AN EYE ON THE TROPICAL WAVE FORECAST TO
MOVE FROM THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN INTO THE GULF EARLY NEXT WEEK FOR
ANY DEVELOPMENT. TOO SOON TO TELL IF THIS WILL BRING US ANY
MOISTURE..BUT SOMETHING TO WATCH.

THE WEATHER PATTERN IS CHANGING SOMEWHAT FROM THE VERY HOT AND DRY
PATTERN OBSERVED RECENTLY...AT LEAST FOR THE SHORT TERM. THE UPPER
LEVEL RIDGE THAT HAS DOMINATED OUR WEATHER HAS RETROGRADED WESTWARD
LEAVING THE MIDSOUTH IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. A COLD FRONT STRETCHES
FROM CENTRAL MO INTO NORTHERN OK THIS MORNING. THIS FRONT WILL PUSH
INTO THE MIDSOUTH DURING THE DAY. THUNDERSTORM COMPLEXES HAVE
DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THIS FRONT. ONE MCS MOVED INTO NORTHEAST AR AND
WEST TN OVERNIGHT..BUT GRADUALLY DISSIPATED. ANOTHER MCS IS MOVING
SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH NORTHERN AR. THIS MCS IS TRYING TO BUILD BACK
TO THE WEST...BUT WILL LIKELY AFFECT PARTS OF EAST AR THIS MORNING.
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM THESE CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES ALONG WITH THE
COLD FRONT WILL COMBINE WITH AN UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE (CAPES 1500 TO
2500 J/KG) ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TO PRODUCE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS
TODAY. ISOLATED PULSE-TYPE THUNDERSTORMS JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE ACROSS
THE MIDSOUTH COULD CAUSE DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL. HOWEVER...THE
STORM PREDICTION CENTER SHOWS THE BEST CHANCE OF SEVERE WEATHER FROM
NORTH MS INTO EAST-CENTRAL AR LATER TODAY AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING
COLD FRONT. MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES WILL BE SUPPRESSED SOME FROM RECENT
DAYS BY MORE CLOUDS AND THE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS...ALTHOUGH IT
WILL STILL BE HOT OUTSIDE OF THE RAIN AREAS.

WILL MAKE ONLY MINOR IF ANY CHANGES TO THE ONGOING FORECAST / GRIDS
TONIGHT AND BEYOND. THE LATEST GFS IS NOT INDICATING THE COLD
FRONT WILL MAKE IT AS FAR SOUTH AS EARLIER EXPECTED AND AS FAR SOUTH
AS FORECAST BY THE LATEST NAM. AS A RESULT...LATER FORECASTS MAY NEED
TO RAISE POPS ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH MS FOR SATURDAY...AND INCLUDE
THEM FOR PARTS OF NORTH MS ON SUNDAY. ATTM...DUE TO THE
UNCERTAINTY...WILL LET LATER SHIFTS TAKE A LOOK AT FURTHER MODEL
RUNS TO SEE IF THESE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE NEEDED. INDEPENDENCE DAY
LOOKS HOT AND MAINLY DRY AS THE BERMUDA HIGH BUILDS OVER THE
MIDSOUTH...ALTHOUGH CAN NOT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM.

AN UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE MID-SOUTH FOR
ONE MORE DAY...ALLOWING FOR ANOTHER HAZY...HOT...AND SEASONABLY
HUMID DAY. THE UPPER RIDGING SHOULD SUPPRESS MOST CLOUD COVER...
ALTHOUGH SOME CU AND AN ISOLATED SHOWER CANNOT BE RULED OUT THIS
AFTERNOON WITH PEAK HEATING...ALTHOUGH PRECIPITATION COVERAGE
SHOULD REMAIN VERY LOW AND WILL BE LEFT OUT OF THE FORECAST.
TEMPERATURES WILL ONCE AGAIN REACH THE MID TO UPPER 90S AREAWIDE...
WITH A FEW LOCATIONS POSSIBLY TOUCHING THE CENTURY MARK. 850 MB
TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 20C EAST AND 22C WEST SUPPORT THESE TYPE OF
TEMPERATURES AND WITH ONLY SCATTERED CU SHOULD ALLOW MAXIMUM
FORECAST TEMPERATURES TO BE REACHED. THESE TEMPERATURES COMBINED
WITH THE HUMIDITY WILL ONCE AGAIN SEND HEAT INDICES TO BETWEEN 105
AND 107 DEGREES THIS AFTERNOON. HEAT WILL ONCE AGAIN BE HIGHLIGHTED
IN THE HWO FOR TODAY.

THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN TONIGHT AS AN UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES THIS MORNING MOVES EAST
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES FRIDAY AND INTO THE NORTHEAST U.S. FOR THE
FIRST PART OF THE WEEKEND. NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA SHOULD
BEGIN TO SEE SOME UPPER LEVEL HEIGHT FALLS LATER TONIGHT AND ACROSS
THE ENTIRE AREA ON FRIDAY. IN ADDITION...THE UPPER TROUGH WILL HELP
TO SEND A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.
EXPECT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OVER MAINLY
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA TONIGHT AND AREAWIDE ON FRIDAY.
ALTHOUGH THE BEST LAPSE RATES REMAIN TO OUR NORTH...CLOSER TO THE
UPPER TROUGH...GOOD SURFACE HEATING AND SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
SHOULD ALLOW FOR MODERATE INSTABILITY LEVELS. THIS WILL SUPPORT
ISOLATED SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS...WITH LOCALIZED STRONG WINDS AND
HAIL...ON FRIDAY...WITH PULSE-TYPE CHARACTERISTICS. NOT EXPECTING
WIDESPREAD SEVERE AT THIS TIME...WITH ATMOSPHERIC SHEAR REMAINING
WEAK. WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS MARGINAL SEVERE THREAT IN HWO. A FEW
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN ON SATURDAY ACROSS
EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA AS THE FRONT BEGINS TO STALL
AND EVENTUALLY WASH OUT BY SUNDAY.

SUNDAY SHOULD BE A DRIER AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AND LESS HUMID DAY
BEHIND THE FRONT...WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVING EAST ACROSS
THE AREA. THE SURFACE HIGH SHOULD MOVE EAST OF THE AREA BY MONDAY...
ALLOWING LOW LEVEL WINDS TO RETURN OUT OF THE SOUTH. IN ADDITION...
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BUILD BACK OVER THE MID-SOUTH FOR THE
FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK. THIS MEANS A RETURN TO SUMMERTIME WEATHER...
WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITY LEVELS. THINK DAYTIME
CONVECTION WILL BE HELD TO A MINIMUM ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY
AFTERNOONS...WITH THE DEGREE OF UPPER RIDGING. SLIGHT CHANCES FOR

TONIGHT...WITH CLEAR SKIES...LIGHT WINDS...AND TEMPERATURES
REMAINING WARM IN THE 70S. AREAS OF FOG AND HAZE ALSO PERSIST
AREAWIDE...WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR EAST CONTINUING TO

APPROACHING 20C EASTERN AREAS AND 22C WESTERN AREAS WILL SUPPORT
HIGH TEMPERATURES INTO THE MID TO UPPER 90S. THINK MOST AREAS WILL
REALIZE THESE HIGH TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON AS ONLY EXPECTING
SOME CU DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON AND EVEN THOUGH AN ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORM MAY DEVELOP...OVERALL COVERAGE SHOULD REMAIN LOW
(BELOW 14%). THURSDAY WILL SEE SIMILAR CONDITIONS...SO ONCE AGAIN
EXPECTING MID TO UPPER 90S. TEMPERATURES MAY BE KNOCKED DOWN A FEW
DEGREES BY LATE AFTERNOON ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS...AS ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER WILL BE POSSIBLE. IN
ADDITION TO THE HOT TEMPERATURES...HUMIDITY LEVELS SHOULD REMAIN

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN ROCKIES TODAY WILL PROGRESS
EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION
THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS WILL HELP TO SEND A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID-
SOUTH DURING THE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY TIME FRAME. MODELS
HAVE TRENDED FASTER AND FURTHER SOUTH WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...
SENDING IT TO A POSITION SOUTH OF THE REGION BY SATURDAY NIGHT.
HAVE KEPT 20 POPS ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON...30
POPS NORTH HALF / 20 POPS SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT. RAISED POPS TO 40
EVERYWHERE FRIDAY WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE AND KEPT 20 POPS SATURDAY TO
ACCOUNT FOR POSSIBLE TIMING ISSUES. SATURDAY POPS MAY NEED TO BE
REMOVED IF CURRENT MODEL TRENDS CONTINUE...BUT WILL HOLD OFF FOR
NOW UNTIL TRENDS CONTINUE A FEW MORE CYCLES. THINK AT THIS TIME THE
POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR A FEW STRONG STORMS NORTHERN AREAS THURSDAY
EVENING AND AREAWIDE FRIDAY. STRONG INSTABILITY AND STEEPENING MID-
LEVEL LAPSE RATES MAY SUPPORT STRONG PULSE-TYPE STORMS. WILL ALSO
HIGHLIGHT THIS THREAT IN HWO.

THE COLD FRONT SHOULD BEGIN TO WASH OUT TO OUR SOUTH ON SUNDAY...AND
WITH DRIER AIRMASS EXPECTED OVER THE AREA...WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY
AND A BIT COOLER AND LESS HUMID. LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNS
FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...SO EXPECT A RETURN OF MORE TYPICAL

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS IN PLACE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING
WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND TEMPERATURES REMAINING IN THE LOWER
70S AND DEWPOINTS AROUND 70. WITH SAME AIRMASS IN PLACE...HAVE
CONTINUED TO SEE HAZE AND SOME FOG...AND THIS SHOULD CONTINUE
THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS.

THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD REMAIN IN PLACE WITH A
WEAKENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH REMAINING STRETCHED ACROSS THE AREA
TODAY. THIS UPPER TROUGH ALONG WITH RELATIVELY MOIST AIRMASS AND
DAYTIME HEATING SHOULD LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON. THE OVERALL COVERAGE SHOULD BE
LESS THAN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS...AS THE UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM
CONTINUES TO WEAKEN. ALSO...BEST COVERAGE (ALTHOUGH STILL ISOLATED)
SHOULD BE ACROSS EASTERN SECTIONS. WITH LESS CLOUD COVER AND STORM
COVERAGE...EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN
YESTERDAYS READINGS...WITH LOW TO MID 90S AREAS ALONG AND WEST OF
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER...WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER READINGS TO THE EAST
(AROUND 90 TO LOW 90S). THE OVERALL SURFACE GRADIENT SHOULD REMAIN
WEAK...SO WITH LIGHT WINDS AND SAME AIRMASS IN PLACE...SHOULD SEE
MORE IN THE WAY OF HAZY SKIES THIS AFTERNOON.

THE WEAK UPPER TROUGH SHOULD MOVE EAST OF THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY...
WITH UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BUILDING OVER THE AREA ALONG WITH
INCREASING 850 MB TEMPERATURES. THIS UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER
THE AREA INTO THURSDAY. THIS MEANS MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS FOR
WEDNESDAY INTO MIDDAY THURSDAY. CANNOT COMPLETELY RULE OUT AN
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM OVER EASTERN SECTIONS ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...
BUT BELIEVE COVERAGE WILL REMAIN LIMITED (14% OR LESS). TEMPERATURES
WILL ALSO BECOME EVEN HOTTER FOR MID WEEK...WITH MID TO UPPER 90S
COMMON ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...ESPECIALLY OVER THE WESTERN HALF
OF THE AREA WHERE SOILS ARE VERY DRY DUE TO ONGOING DROUGHT
CONDITIONS. 850 MB TEMPERATURES SUPPORT THESE HOT TEMPERATURES AS
WELL WITH MODELS INDICATING 18C EAST TO 21C WEST ON WEDNESDAY AND
20C EAST TO 22C WEST ON THURSDAY. BOTTOM LINE...IT WILL BE HAZY AND
HOT FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...AND HIGH HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL MAKE
THINGS FEEL EVEN HOTTER WITH HEAT INDICES RANGING FROM 100-105
DEGREES DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS.

FOR THE END OF THE WEEK...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH NOW OVER THE PACIFIC
NORTHWEST IS FORECAST TO MOVE EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS
STATES AND INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS UPPER SYSTEM WILL HELP
TO SEND A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE AREA LATER THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND
INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. EXPECT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
TO BEGIN TO INCREASE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BECOME
INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD...WITH INCREASING CAPE
VALUES AND STEEPENING LAPSE RATES...CANNOT RULE OUT A FEW STRONG
PULSE-TYPE THUNDERSTORMS IN NORTHERN AREAS.

THIS FRONT IS FORECAST TO STALL ACROSS THE AREA FOR FRIDAY AND INTO
THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEKEND. IN ADDITION...THE UPPER FLOW IS
FORECAST TO TURN MORE NORTHWESTERLY ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. THIS
PATTERN MAY SUPPORT THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW MCS THAT WOULD BE
DIRECTED THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH. A BIT TOO EARLY TO SAY FOR SURE...BUT
WITH THE FRONT IN THE AREA AND THE NAM/GFS/ECMWF HINTING AT THIS
SCENARIO...THOUGHT IT PRUDENT TO UP POPS FOR THE FRIDAY THROUGH
SATURDAY TIME FRAME.

UPPER RIDGING WILL BUILD BACK OVER THE AREA FOR THE END OF THE
WEEKEND AND THE 4TH OF JULY HOLIDAY...WITH DECREASING RAIN CHANCES
AND INCREASING TEMPERATURES.

UPPER LEVEL LOW WAS CENTERED OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE THIS AFTERNOON
WITH SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA.
UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTH TONIGHT BRINGING REGION BACK
INTO MORE TYPICAL SUMMER PATTERN. NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WILL FEATURE
WIDELY SCATTERED MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING THUNDERSTORMS
FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THURSDAY SHOULD BE DRY AS UPPER LEVEL
RIDGE TRIES TO TAKE OVER. BY FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...A WEAK COLD
FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION SHOULD WE RETURN TO THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF
A THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. IT APPEARS THAT JULY 4TH SHOULD
BE DRY AS WELL AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE TRIES TO REGAIN CONTROL OVER THE

WEAK UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER NRN MS THIS MORNING WITH SCT-BKN CLOUD 
COVER ACRS THE REGION. RADAR WAS RELATIVELY QUIET WITH A FEW SHOWERS 
ACRS ERN AR. UPPER LOW WL SLOWLY MEANDER NORTH INTO WEST TENNESSEE 
THIS AFTN. EXPECT SCT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO REDEVELOP AS SFC 
HEATING INCREASES THROUGHOUT THE DAY. LAPSE RATES VERY MARGINAL SO 
STORMS WL REMAIN BLO SVR LIMITS. CLOUDS AND PRECIP WL KEEP TEMPS 
SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL...UPPER 80S TO AROUND 90. WINDS WILL STILL 
REMAIN LIGHT SO EXPECT A GOOD DEAL OF HAZE TO CONTINUE.

LOW WEAKENS INTO AN UPPER TROF BY 12Z TUE. EXPECT CONVECTION TO 
DISSIPATE WITH LOSS OF HEATING THIS EVENING. ON TUE UPPER TROF WL 
BEGIN TO SHIFT EAST WITH THE AXIS ALONG THE TN RIVER. PRECIP CHANCES 
WL PROBABLY BE HIGHEST ACRS ERN SXNS. DRIER AIR WL START TO WORK 
INTO WRN SXNS DURING THE AFTN SO HIGH TEMPS WL START TO REBOUND WITH 
LOWER 90S WEST OF THE MS RIVER. 

NAM SHOWS A MCS MOVING INTO THE REGION TUE NIGHT BUT THIS LOOKS 
SUSPICIOUS AND WL BE IGNORED FOR NOW. BY WED THE UPPER TROF SHIFTS 
INTO MID TN WITH HIGHEST POPS ACRS ERN SXNS...DISSIPATING DURING THE 
EVENING. AS SW SFC GRADIENT DEVELOPS MUCH WARMER AND DRIER AIR WL 
CONT TO WORK INTO WRN SXNS OF THE CWFA. EXPECT MID 90S ACRS THE WRN 
HALF OF THE AREA WITH LOWER 90S TO THE EAST WED AFTN.

THU WL BE QUITE WARM WITH WSW SFC FLOW. MAYBE A FEW AFTN TSTMS BUT 
FOR THE MOST PART DRY. TEMPS WL ONCE AGAIN CLIMB INTO THE MID 90S 
WRN SXNS.  

THU NIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND...UPPER TROF PUSHES THROUGH THE GREAT

AN UPPER LOW IS OVER SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI THIS AFTERNOON. A TROUGH 
EXTENDS NORTHWARD FROM THE LOW. AN AREA OF SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSHOWERS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TROUGH. AFTERNOON 
HEATING HAS GREATLY AIDED THE COVERAGE OF THESE STORMS. THESE 
STORMS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO REACH SEVERE CRITERIA ALTHOUGH VERY 
IMPRESSIVE AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING ALONG WITH HEAVY DOWNPOURS HAS 
ACCOMPANIED THESE STORMS. THE COVERAGE SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH 
THIS EVENING AS HEATING DIMINISHES BUT THE TROUGH WILL STILL REMAIN 
IN THE VICINITY KEEPING THE THREAT FOR CONVECTION IN TONIGHT. 

THE UPPER LOW WILL MOVE OVER THE REGION TOMORROW. WIND FIELDS ARE SO 
WEAK THAT IT IS REALLY DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT EXACTLY WHERE OR WHEN 
CONVECTION WILL BREAK OUT. SO HAVE BROADBRUSHED THE AREA WITH 40 
POPS. EXPECT A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUDS...PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY WHICH 
SHOULD KEEP THE TEMPS DOWN A LITTLE.

THE LOW MOVES OFF TO THE NORTH ON TUESDAY BUT A TROUGH STILL REMAINS 
BEHIND. THIS COULD BE A FOCUS FOR THUNDERSTORMS ONCE AGAIN ON 
TUESDAY. MID WEEK LOOKS LIKE A RETURN TO THE TYPICAL SUMMER PATTERN 
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS WITH WARM TEMPS AND AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS 
POSSIBLE. THE COVERAGE SHOULDNT BE AS GREAT WITH THE GFS SHOWING 
SOME DRIER AIR ADVECTING IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST. TOWARDS THE END OF 
THE WEEK AND OVER THE WEEKEND...A FRONT IS EXPECTED TO AT LEAST 
APPROACH THE REGION FROM THE NORTH. IF THE GFS IS CORRECT AND IT 
STALLS OUT OVER THE REGION...THIS COULD RESULT IN DAILY MCS 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE FRONT. AM LEARY OF THE SOLUTION AND THUS 
HESITANT TO GO WITH MORE THAN 20 POPS SINCE THE GFS HASNT BEEN VERY

DISSIPATE TOWARDS SUNSET. EXPECT TONIGHT/S FORECAST TO BE VERY

SOMEWHAT WILL BE ERODED MORE NOTICEABLY OVER THESE AREAS BY THE

.UPDATE...
TODAY IS VIRTUALLY A REPEAT PERFORMANCE OF YESTERDAY. UPPER RIDGE 
CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE WEATHER OVER THE MIDSOUTH...PROVIDING FOR 
HOT AND HAZY WEATHER. TEMPERATURES AT 15Z ARE ALMOST IDENTICAL TO 
WHAT THEY WERE 24 HRS AGO. WITH THIS IN MIND...EXPECT TEMPS TO COME 
CLOSE TO WHAT THEY WERE YESTERDAY. THE 12Z RUC AND NAM DO SHOW 
INCREASING 850MB TEMPS (AROUND 19-20C) OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE 
AREA WHICH MAY ALLOW FOR TEMPS TO BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER. EXPECT 
A CU FIELD TO DEVELOP WITHIN THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS AS WELL. 
CURRENT FORECAST HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON THIS AND NO ZONE UPDATE WILL 
BE NEEDED. DID MAKE SOME MINOR TWEAKS IN THE DEWPOINT GRIDS TO ALLOW 
FOR SOME LOWER DEWPOINTS THIS AFTERNOON AS DEEP MIXING UP TO 650MB 
WILL OCCUR TODAY.

FYI...RECORD HIGH AT KMEM IS 100 SET IN 1953. CURRENT FORECAST IS 
FOR 98...BUT KNOWING KMEM LIKE WE DO...CANNOT RULE OUT THE CENTURY 
MARK. HOWEVER..EXPECT THE CU FIELD TO KEEP THEM SOMEWHAT IN 
CHECK...JUST LIKE WHAT OCCURRED YESTERDAY.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 320 AM FRI JUN 24...
UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE MS RIVER VALLEY THROUGH SAT 
WITH HOT AND DRY WEATHER. STAGNANT AIRMASS WILL CONTINUE WITH HIGH 
POLLUTION LEVELS IN THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA...OZONE AND PARTICULATE 
MATTER...THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY. TODAY SHOULD BE VERY SIMILAR TO 
YESTERDAY. 850 MB TEMPS APPROACH 20C OVER WESTERN SXNS AND SFC TEMPS 
SHOULD BE 1-2 DEGREES HIGHER THAN YESTERDAYS NUMBERS. THIS WL RESULT 
IN UPPER 90S WEST WITH LOWER/MID 90S EAST THIS AFTN. SIMILAR CONDS 
FOR SAT. SFC DEWPOINTS WL SLOWLY BE INCREASING THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD 
SO IT WILL BEGIN TO FEEL MORE MUGGY. HEAT INDICES WILL REACH 100 
DEGREES ACRS MEMPHIS METRO...NW MS AND ERN AR TODAY AND SAT.

BY SUN AFTN RIDGE STARTS TO RETROGRADE A LITTLE AS WEAK UPPER TROF 
PUSHES INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST. 00Z GFS AND NAM IN FAIRLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THIS FEATURE THROUGH GFS A LITTLE FASTER. GFS 
INDICATES POSSIBILITY OF A ISOLD TSTMS SUN AFTN BUT WL HOLD OFF FOR 
NOW. STILL HOT AND MUGGY SUN THOUGH A TAD COOLER THAN FRI/SAT.

WEAK UPPER TROF AND SFC RETURN FLOW PERSIST FROM MON THROUGH WED. 
THIS WL SET THE STAGE FOR ISOLD AFTN TSTMS AND CONTINUED WARM AND 
MUGGY CONDS. 00Z GFS CONTINUES TO PUSH A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE

WITH HOT AND DRY WEATHER. STAGNANT AIRMASS WILL CONTINUE WITH HIGH 
POLLUTION LEVELS IN THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA...OZONE AND PARTICULATE 
MATTER...THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY. TODAY SHOULD BE VERY SIMILAR TO 
YESTERDAY. 850 MB TEMPS APPROACH 20C OVER WESTERN SXNS AND SFC TEMPS 
SHOULD BE 1-2 DEGREES HIGHER THAN YESTERDAYS NUMBERS. THIS WL RESULT 
IN UPPER 90S WEST WITH LOWER/MID 90S EAST THIS AFTN. SIMILAR CONDS 
FOR SAT. SFC DEWPOINTS WL SLOWLY BE INCREASING THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD 
SO IT WILL BEGIN TO FEEL MORE MUGGY. HEAT INDICES WILL REACH 100 
DEGREES ACRS MEMPHIS METRO...NW MS AND ERN AR TODAY AND SAT.

BY SUN AFTN RIDGE STARTS TO RETROGRADE A LITTLE AS WEAK UPPER TROF 
PUSHES INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST. 00Z GFS AND NAM IN FAIRLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THIS FEATURE THROUGH GFS A LITTLE FASTER. GFS 
INDICATES POSSIBILITY OF A ISOLD TSTMS SUN AFTN BUT WL HOLD OFF FOR 
NOW. STILL HOT AND MUGGY SUN THOUGH A TAD COOLER THAN FRI/SAT.

WEAK UPPER TROF AND SFC RETURN FLOW PERSIST FROM MON THROUGH WED. 
THIS WL SET THE STAGE FOR ISOLD AFTN TSTMS AND CONTINUED WARM AND 
MUGGY CONDS. 00Z GFS CONTINUES TO PUSH A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE

.DISCUSSION...
HOT AND DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE TO PERSIST OVER THE MIDSOUTH FOR 
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL 
SUPPRESSING ANY CHANCES FOR CONVECTION. TOMORROW SHOULD BE VERY 
SIMILAR TO TODAY. ETA IS FORECASTING 850MB TEMPS TO RISE NEAR 21C 
OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA...WHILE GFS KEEPS IT BETWEEN 18C 
AND 19C. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WITH DRY SOIL AND HIGH 850 
TEMPS...EXPECT TEMPS TO CLIMB BACK INTO THE UPPER 90S OVER THE 
WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA...WITH LOWER 90S EAST WHERE SOIL MOISTURE 
IS CLOSER TO NORMAL. KMEM WILL LIKELY REACH CLOSE TO THE CENTURY 
MARK TOMORROW (MAY STILL GET THERE TODAY.) FYI...THE LAST 100 DEGREE 
WEATHER EXPERIENCED IN MEMPHIS OCCURRED WAY BACK IN AUGUST AND 
SEPTEMBER OF 2000. HEAT INDICES WILL NOT BE AS BAD AS THEY COULD BE. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT MIXING WILL OCCUR ALL THE WAY UP TO 
600MB...QUITE IMPRESSIVE. THIS WILL HELP TO MIX DOWN DRIER AIR AND 
KEEP DEWPOINTS IN CHECK. 

THE WEEKEND WILL BE A VIRTUAL REPEAT. ETA AND GFS TRY TO DEVELOP A 
TROPICAL SYSTEM OVER THE BAHAMAS AND SEND IT TO THE SE US COAST ON 
SUNDAY. THE ETA BRINGS A GOOD BIT OF MOISTURE TO THE MIDSOUTH WHILE 
THE GFS CONFINES IT TO THE EASTERN SEABOARD. ECMWF NOT ON BOARD WITH 
THIS FEATURE AND THE UKMET IS MUCH WEAKER. THEREFORE...WILL MAINTAIN 
THE STATUS QUO FOR NOW AND KEEP THINGS DRY AND HOT.

A RETURN FLOW WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP BY MONDAY AND WILL PERSIST 
THROUGH THE WEEK. THIS WILL HELP BRING DEWPOINTS UP. THE AXIS OF THE 
UPPER RIDGE WILL SHIFT EAST...LEAVING SOMEWHAT OF A WEAKNESS OVER 
THE CWA. WILL INTRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AFTERNOON TSTMS MONDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY. CERTAINLY NOT A DROUGHT BUSTER. TEMPS SHOULD ALSO 
RETURN CLOSER TO NORMAL WITH MORE CU DEVELOPMENT EXPECTED...ALTHOUGH 
IT WILL DEFINITELY FEEL MORE MUGGY OUT. 

12Z GFS BREAKS DOWN THE EAST COAST RIDGE...ALLOWING FOR A SHORTWAVE 
TO PUSH A COLD FRONT CLOSE TO THE REGION. THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THE 
GFS HAS ADVERTISED THIS AND OTHER GLOBAL GUIDANCE NOT AGREEING AT 
THIS TIME. WILL HOLD ONTO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AND WAIT FOR GUIDANCE 
TO COME INTO SOME BETTER AGREEMENT.

.UPDATE...
HOT...HAZY...AND HUMID JUST ABOUT SUMS UP THE WEATHER OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH. PERSISTENT UPPER LEVEL RIDGE CONTINUES TO HAVE A FIRM GRIP 
OVER OUR WEATHER. TEMPS RISING QUICKLY THIS MORNING. HAVE ADJUSTED 
TEMPS ACROSS THE AREA TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS. AS HAS BEEN THE 
CASE...WESTERN AREAS WILL BE WARMER WITH AXIS OF HIGHER 850 TEMPS 
AND DRIER SOILS HELPING TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB EVEN HIGHER. KMEM 
ALREADY AT 90 DEGREES...THEREFORE HAVE BUMPED THEIR HIGH TODAY TO 
THE CENTURY MARK (RECORD HIGH IS 101 SET IN 1988.) CERTAINLY SEEMS 
REASONABLE GIVEN THE FACT THAT DRY ATMOSPHERIC LAYER WILL SUPPRESS 
AN ABUNDANT CU FIELD...ALTHOUGH DO EXPECT A FEW CU TODAY. ALSO WILL 
INCLUDE MENTION OF HAZE IN GRIDS AND ZONES. GRIDS ALREADY OUT. 
UPDATE TO ZONES OUT SHORTLY.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 240 AM JUN 23 2005...

PERSISTENT WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL HOLD OVER THE REGION
FOR MUCH OF THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS. THE RESULT WILL BE LITTLE CHANCE OF
RAIN AND AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW TO MID 90S AT LEAST
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. MODELS ARE SHOWING A WEAK UPPER LOW POSSIBLY
MAKING ITS WAY FROM FLORIDA TOWARD THE REGION FOR THE BEGINNING OF
NEXT WEEK. THERE DOES NOT SEEM TO BE MUCH AGREEMENT ON WHERE THIS
LOW MAY END UP BUT IT MAY BE ENOUGH TO KICK OFF SOME AFTERNOON

AN AREA OF BROAD SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY REGION. THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG RIDGE OVER THE 
CENTRAL US. AFTERNOON CU DEVELOPED THIS AFTERNOON OVER MUCH OF THIS 
REGION. SURFACE DEW POINTS ARE NOTABLY LOW...IN THE LOWER 60S. THIS 
IS LIKELY DUE TO DEEP MIXING OF DRY AIR FROM ALOFT TO THE SURFACE. 

THE UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OVER THE REGION. AS A 
RESULT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD CONTINUE TO WARM INTO THE WEEKEND. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS SUPPORT UPPER 90S FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 
WEEK...HOWEVER AFTERNOON CU DEVELOP MAY INHIBIT THAT. HAVE MIN TEMPS 
GOING BELOW GUIDANCE DURING THE SHORT TERM SINCE THE MODELS ARE NOT 
HANDLING THE LOW DEW POINTS THAT ARE BEING MIXED DOWN DURING THE 
AFTERNOON WELL AT ALL. RAIN CHANCES LOOK VIRTUALLY NONEXISTENT FOR 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY SINCE THERE IS A STRONG CAP IN PLACE AND TEMPS 
WOULD HAVE TO GET INTO THE TRIPLE DIGITS JUST FOR POPCORN 
THUNDERSTORMS TO FIRE. OVER THE WEEKEND...THE MODELS SHOW MOISTURE 
BEGINNING TO WORK BACK INTO THE AREA. THIS WILL PROVIDE A SLIGHTLY 
BETTER CHANCE AND AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM CANT BE ENTIRELY RULED 
OUT. STILL...THE POSITION OF THE UPPER RIDGE WILL WORK AGAINST 
DEVELOPMENT. AT THIS POINT...IF ANY STORMS WERE TO FIRE COVERAGE 
WOULD LIKELY BE VERY VERY LOW. 

THERE IS SOME HOPE FOR RAIN PERHAPS EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS SHOWS THE 
POSITION OF THE RIDGE MOVING FURTHER AWAY FROM THE REGION AND 
SLIGHTLY DEEPER MOISTURE MOVING UP FROM THE SOUTH. THERE DOES NOT 
LOOK LIKE ANY ORGANIZED FEATURE WITH THIS. BUT THINK THAT ISOLATED 
TO SCATTERED AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSHOWERS MAY BE POSSIBLE.

HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED NEAR THE FORT SMITH AREA. THIS IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH A BROAD RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL US. THE UPPER LOW 
THAT HAD BROUGHT THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TO THE SOUTHEAST HAS MOVED 
OFFSHORE AND HAS BEEN REPLACED BY AN UPPER TROUGH ALONG THE COAST. 
SOUNDINGS FROM LZK/JAN/OHX/SGF AND ACARS SOUNDINGS FROM MEMPHIS ALL 
SHOW A STRONG CAP OVER THE REGION WITH A MAX TEMP OF AT LEAST 100 
DEGREES NEEDED TO BREAK IT. NO DISTURBANCES ARE MOVING THROUGH SO 
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER DRY DAY. FORECAST TEMPS LOOKS REASONABLE WITH 
GUIDANCE AND SOUNDINGS SUPPORTING MID 90S ACROSS MUCH OF EASTERN 
ARKANSAS...BOOTHEEL AND INTO NORTHWEST MS AND SOUTHWEST TN.

SOUTH IS IN BETWEEN THESE TWO UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS WITH DRY NORTHERLY
UPPER LEVEL FLOW PERSISTING. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STILL ANCHORED
OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION AND EXTENDING SOUTHWARD INTO OUR AREA.
THIS MEANS ANOTHER DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAR NIGHT IN STORE...WITH ONLY A
FEW THIN HIGH CIRRUS PASSING OVERHEAD. THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD
CONTINUE TO DECOUPLE THIS EVENING AND TEMPERATURES SHOULD DROP
TOWARDS THE DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES LATER TONIGHT.

AS WAS SEEN DURING THE PAST COUPLE NIGHTS...DEWPOINTS HAVE COME UP A
BIT AFTER DECOUPLING AS WE LOSE THE AFTERNOON MIXING OF DRYER AIR
FROM ALOFT...BUT SHOULD SEE DEWPOINTS SETTLE BACK DOWN A FEW DEGREES
LATER TONIGHT. WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE DECIDED TO SHAVE A FEW

THE MID-SOUTH IS POSITIONED BETWEEN AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES AND A BUILDING UPPER LEVEL
RIDGE OVER THE PLAINS. THIS WILL KEEP A DRY NORTHERLY UPPER LEVEL
FLOW OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE IS
CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION AND EXTENDS SOUTHWARD OVER OUR
AREA. A FEW HIGH THIN CIRRUS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL JET
STREAK WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE OVERHEAD THIS EVENING. THESE CLOUDS
SHOULD REMAIN THIN ENOUGH TO KEEP MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES IN THE FORECAST.
ALSO...ANOTHER DRY NIGHT IS IN STORE AND WITH SEASONABLY LOW
DEWPOINTS IN PLACE...EXPECT GOOD RADIATIONAL CONDITIONS OVER THE
REGION. THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 50S OVER
EASTERN AREAS TO UPPER 60S IN THE NORMALLY WARMER DELTA REGION AND
MEMPHIS URBAN CORRIDOR.

CURRENT FORECAST HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON THE CURRENT WEATHER
SITUATION...SO NO UPDATES TO THE FORECAST ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME.

.UPDATE...
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS POSITIONED OVER THE PLAIN STATES IS RESULTING 
IN A DEEP NORTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WHICH IS HELPING TO 
USHER IN MORE DRY AIR. VORT MAX THAT BROUGHT CLOUDS TO THE REGION 
TODAY CONTINUES TO MOVE SOUTHEAST WITH SKIES CLEARING ACROSS THE 
CWA. WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST TO MENTION MOSTLY CLEAR TO CLEAR 
SKIES. TEMPERATURES A BIT TRICKY TONIGHT. CONSIDERING THE BOTTOM 
FELL OUT OVER NORTHEASTERN AREAS LAST NIGHT...CURRENT FORECAST OF 
MIDDLE 50S IS CERTAINLY REASONABLE. DROPPED TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO 
ACROSS THE REST OF THE CWA GIVEN TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS ARE A LITTLE 
LOWER THAN LAST NIGHT. REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. GRIDS 
ALREADY SENT AND THE ZONES WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 200 PM FRI JUN 17...

.SYNOPSIS
WEAK 500 MB TROF MOVING INTO THE DEEP SOUTH...MEANWHILE A DRY 
NORTHEAST SURFACE FLOW IS OVERSPREADING THE MID-SOUTH.  TEMPERATURES 
ARE A LITTLE BELOW AVERAGE FOR MID-JUNE. 

&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...
SIGNIFICANT TROF ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WILL DOMINANT OUR 
WEEKEND WEATHER.  THIS UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL RESULT IN COOLER THAN 
AVERAGE TEMPERATURES AND SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER DEW POINTS. NO 
PRECIPITATION IS FORECAST.

&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER SUNDAY)...
GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT.  AT THE START OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD NORTHERLY FLOW ALOFT CONTINUES WITH EASTERN TROF.  
DRY WEATHER IS LIKELY FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  FOR DAYS 5 THROUGH 
7 A DECENT RIDGE DEVELOPS ACROSS THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES AS THE 
EASTERN TROF GRADUALLY SLIPS AWAY.  THERE IS SOME SLIGHT DEBATE THAT 
NIGHTTIME MESOSCALE COMPLEXES MAY DEVELOP (RING OF FIRE) OVER THE 
NATIONS MIDSECTION AND DROP INTO THE MID-SOUTH BY MORNING...SINCE 
THE 500 MB FLOW REMAINS WEAKLY NORTHWEST.  AT THIS TIME...THERE 
ISNT ENOUGH CERTAINTY IN THE TIMING AND PLACEMENT OF EXPECTED

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT WEATHER ALMOST A CARBON COPY OF YESTERDAY MORNING...WITH A
MCS TO OUR WEST. THIS ONE APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY FURTHER WEST THAN
YESTERDAY. STARTING TO SEE THE CIRRUS SHIELD ARRIVE FROM THE WEST.
AIRMASS PRETTY STABLE...FOR MID-JUNE...WITH DEWPOINTS MID 50S TO
LOWER 60S FOR MOST PART. TEMPS RANGE FROM MID 50S NORTHEAST TO LOWER
70S IN THE DELTA.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...
ONLY PRECIPITATION QUESTION FOR THE ENTIRE WEEKEND APPEARS TO BE
WHETHER CURRENT MCS WILL SCRAPE THE EXTREME WEST PORTIONS OF THE CWA
LATER TODAY. WE HAVE LOW POPS THERE...WHICH FITS WITH JAN AND LZK...
AND WILL LEAVE THEM THERE FOR NOW. TEMPS MAINLY IN THE MID 80S TODAY
LOOK REASONABLE BASED ON EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

MODEL DATA INDICATES THREAT FOR A MCS TO AFFECT THE CWA WILL DECREASE
AFTER THE CURRENT ONE PASSES BY. HEIGHTS BEGIN RISING...AND NO
SIGNIFICANT IMPULSE TO RIDE OVER TOP OF RIDGE TO OUR WEST. THIS
SHOULD ALLOW FOR LESS CLOUD COVER OVER THE WEEKEND AND TEMPERATURES
SLIGHTLY WARMER.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER SUNDAY)...
EXTENDED MODELS HAVE BACKED AWAY FROM EARLIER SOLUTIONS WITH AN
UPPER LOW NEAR OUR AREA. CURRENT SOLUTIONS NOW FORECAST OUR CWA
TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF UPPER RIDGE FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

THIS WILL MEAN A DRY FORECAST FOR THE ENTIRE EXTENDED. GUESS AN
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM COULD BE POSSIBLE DURING THE EXTENDED...BUT
NO SIGNIFICANT IMPULSES TO TRIGGER ORGANIZED CONVECTION...AND
DEWPOINTS WILL BE RUNNING LOWER THAN NORMAL.

THIS SOLUTION WOULD MEAN LESS CLOUD COVER AND WARMER TEMPERATURES.
THIS IS REFLECTED IN THIS MORNINGS MEX DATA. HIGH TEMPERATURES IN
EXTENDED PORTION OF FORECAST HAVE BEEN RAISED ABOUT 1 CATEGORY.

SOIL CONDITIONS MAY AFFECT MAX TEMPS MORE THAN ANYTHING NEXT WEEK.
EASTERN PORTION OF CWA RECEIVED CONSIDERABLE RAINFALL FROM TS
ARLENE OVER THE WEEKEND. AREAS NEAR AND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER ARE RATHER DRY FOR THE MOST PART. DURING THE PAST COUPLE OF
WEEKS...MAX TEMPS IN AREAS WITH DRY SOILS HAVE BEEN RUNNING ABOVE
GUIDANCE...USUALLY ABOUT 3 TO 5 DEGREES. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF
THIS MORNINGS MEX DATA IS ACTUALLY COOLER THAN WHAT WE SEE NEXT

.UPDATE...
THE SHORTWAVE THAT BROUGHT MOSTLY CLOUDS SKIES AND SOME SPRINKLES TO 
THE MIDSOUTH TODAY IS BEGINNING TO DEPART THE REGION. AS A 
RESULT...CLOUDS ARE DECREASING AND ALL SPRINKLES HAVE ENDED. WILL 
ISSUE UPDATE TO REMOVE ALL MENTION OF SPRINKLES AND TO UPDATE CLOUD 
COVER FROM MOSTLY CLEAR IN THE NE AREAS TO PARTLY CLOUDY ELSEWHERE.

TWO VIGOROUS THUNDERSTORM COMPLEXES HAVE DEVELOPED FROM SOUTHERN 
KANSAS DOWN TO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE. AN OVERNIGHT MCS WILL RESULT 
FROM THESE COMPLEXES AND MOVE SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT. THE MCS SHOULD 
STAY TO THE SOUTH AND WEST OF THE MIDSOUTH AS IT RIDES JUST TO THE 
NORTH OF A STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOCATED FROM THE OK PANHANDLE 
DOWN TO THE LOUISIANA GULF COAST. THIS IS WHERE THE RICHEST AREA OF 
THETA-E AIR IS LOCATED. CURRENT FORECAST HAS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER 
THE SW PORTION OF THE CWA AND WILL LEAVE AS IS. CANNOT RULE OUT A 
FEW LIGHT SHOWERS SKIRTING THOSE AREAS DURING THE EARLY MORNING 
HOURS...BUT MOST AREAS WILL STAY DRY.

TEMP FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AND NO CHANGES ARE NEEDED. ZONE UPDATE WILL 
BE OUT SHORTLY. UPDATED GRIDS ALREADY SENT.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED 323 PM THU JUN 16 2005...

LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE AND RADAR TRENDS SHOW AN MCV MOVING SLOWLY 
EAST ACROSS ARKANSAS. RADAR RETURNS THUS FAR HAVE ONLY SHOWN MID TO 
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WITH VIRGA...AND POSSIBLY A SPRINLKE PRECIPITATING 
OUT AT BEST WITH A STABLE LOW LEVEL DRY LAYER NEAR THE SURFACE. 

ANOTHER NORTHWEST FLOW SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE LOWER AND 
MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT. AN MCS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP 
ACROSS EASTERN NEBRASKA AND MOVE SOUTH SOUTHEAST TONIGHT ALONG A 
THERMAL GRADIENT UPSTREAM. NEARLY ALL OF THE CONVECTIVE 
ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE BETTER 
INSTABILITY LIES. AS A RESULT...WILL CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SPRINKLES EARLY THIS EVENING TO ACCOUNT FOR MCV...AND TRIMMED BACK 
POPS TO A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS WITH POOR CONVECTIVE 
INDICIES ACROSS THE AREA. 

SOME MODEL DISAGREEMENT EXISTS IN HANDLING OF NEXT LOBE OF ENERGY IN 
NORTHWEST FLOW ON FRIDAY. NONETHELESS...ANOTHER MCS WILL DEVELOP 
ALONG THERMAL GRADIENT OVER SE KS/N OK AND SLIDE 
SOUTHEAST...PRIMARILY MISSING THE FORECAST AREA ONCE AGAIN AND 
TRIMMED BACK POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS THE WESTERN ONE THIRD OF 
THE AREA. 

LONG RANGE...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL BLOCKING 
PATTERN WILL SET UP THIS WEEKEND ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S....BRINGING 
DRY WEATHER THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PACKAGE.  OVERALL UPPER 
AIR PATTERN OVER NORTH AMERICA WILL CONSIST OF BROAD UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING ACROSS MOST OF THE U.S. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF CYCLONIC FLOW 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE LONG

PLEASANT NIGHT OCCURRING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. SKIES ARE CLEAR AND 
TEMPERATURES ARE CURRENTLY IN THE LOWER 70S FOR THE MOST PART. TO 
THE WEST...ACROSS OKLAHOMA AND KANSAS...A MCS HAS DEVELOPED. MODELS 
SHOWING REMNANTS OF THE MCS MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD THIS MORNING ACROSS 
ARKANSAS...BUT FAR ENOUGH TO THE SOUTHWEST THAT IT SHOULD AVOID THE 
CWA. WILL GO WITH A DRY FORECAST TODAY. 

ANOTHER MCS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP TONIGHT A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH 
THAN THE ONE THIS EVENING. THIS COULD BRING THE REMNANTS OVER THE 
SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF THE CWA TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS.

ANOTHER MCS COULD DEVELOP FRIDAY NIGHT AND BRING A SIMILAR SCENARIO 
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY AS WHAT IS EXPECTED FOR TONIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY. HOWEVER THE GFS DISAGREES WITH THE NAM ON THIS SOLUTION. THE 
GFS KEEPS FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY DRY WITH ANY POTENTIAL MCS 
DEVELOPMENT TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE CWA. CURRENT FORECAST HAS 20 
POPS IN FOR EARLY FRIDAY EVENING AND DRY AFTER THAT. WILL KEEP AS IS 
FOR NOW UNTIL THERE IS SOME AGREEMENT.

HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO BUILD FURTHER INTO THE MIDSOUTH ON 
SUNDAY AND BRING DRY AND PLEASANT WEATHER THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. EXPECT HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S AND LOWS IN 
THE 60S FOR THE MOST PART. HOWEVER...THERE IS STILL A CHANCE THAT AN 
UPPER LOW WILL DEVELOP ALONG EAST COAST AND RETROGRADE TO THE WEST 
BY TUESDAY BRINGING A CHANCE OF RAIN TO THE CWA. THE LATEST GFS DOES 
NOT SUPPORT THIS SOLUTION. HOWEVER THE LATEST ECMWF DOES. CURRENT

WITH ONLY 0.83 INCHES OF PRECIPITABLE WATER (COMPARED TO A NORMAL 
NEAR 1.5 INCHES.) THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING 
NIGHT. TEMPS ALREADY RUNNING 2 TO 4 DEGREES COOLER THAN LAST NIGHT 
AND THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON OVERNIGHT LOWS. NO 
UPDATES PLANNED AT THIS TIME. JUST MADE SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO 
DEWPOINT AND HUMIDITY GRIDS TO ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT OBS...BUT NOTHING 
SIGNIFICANT.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED 230 PM WED JUN 15 2005...

HIGH PRESSURE OVER EASTERN OKLAHOMA IS PROVIDING THE REGION WITH DRY 
WEATHER TODAY. THE WEATHER OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS WILL BE DOMINATED 
BY HIGH PRESSURE. CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW TEMPS 
TONIGHT TO DROP INTO THE 60S. WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF A FEW UPPER 
50S ARE REPORTED SINCE DEW POINTS THIS AFTERNOON FELL INTO THE UPPER 
50S. 

TOMORROW...BOTH GFS AND ETA SHOW AN MCS DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT 
OVER EASTERN KANSAS IN ASSOCIATION WITH A POSITIVE VORT MAX MOVING 
THROUGH THE AREA. WITH THE REGION IN NORTHWEST FLOW...THE AREA 
SHOULD BEGIN TO SEE CLOUDS FROM THIS STORM SYSTEM BY THE AFTERNOON 
WITH PORTIONS OF EASTERN ARKANSAS POSSIBLY SEEING RAIN LATE 
AFTERNOON. BOTH MODELS SHOW A TIGHT THERMAL GRADIENT AT 850 MB 
EXTENDING FROM AROUND FAYETTEVILLE ARKANSAS THROUGH PINE BLUFF. 
EXPECT THAT THE MCS WILL TRACK ALONG THIS BOUNDARY. MODELS CONTINUE 
TO SHOW THAT THE INSTABILITY OVER THE REGION WILL REMAIN VERY STABLE 
WITH LIS AROUND 0 OR -1 AND CAPE UNDER 500 J/KG. SO EXPECT THE MCS 
TO WEAKEN AS IT APPROACHES THE REGION. THE BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN 
WILL BE TOMORROW NIGHT AS A LOW LEVEL JET OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST 
ARRIVES INTO THE REGION. THE AREA OF POSITIVE VORTICITY WILL BE 
MOVING THROUGH AS WELL AND A 60KT UPPER LEVEL JET WILL BE MOVING 
INTO THE AREA. THE BEST CHANCES WILL BE SOUTHWEST OF MEMPHIS WHERE 
THE LOW LEVEL THERMAL GRADIENT SETS UP. TIMING OF CLOUD COVER WILL 
DICTATE HIGHS TOMORROW. THEREFORE AREAS ACROSS EASTERN ARKANSAS 
SHOULD SEE HIGHS IN THE MID 80S. ELSEWHERE...HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S 
TO AROUND 90 SHOULD BE COMMON. 

ON FRIDAY...THE PRESENCE OF THE UPPER JET MOVING THROUGH THE REGION 
WILL RESULT IN A THREAT FOR RAIN AREAWIDE WITH ONCE AGAIN THE BETTER 
CHANCES SOUTH OF A LINE FROM CLARKSDALE TO TUPELO DUE TO THEIR 
PROXIMITY OF THE THERMAL GRADIENT. AN OMEGA BLOCK WILL BE SETTING UP 
ACROSS THE US. AM REASONABLY CONFIDENT THAT THE FORECAST FOR OVER 
THE WEEKEND WILL REMAIN DRY AND COOLER THAN THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH 
THE UPPER RIDGE PROVIDING DRY WEATHER BUT STILL CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE 
THERMAL TROUGH. AFTER THE WEEKEND THERE IS MUCH DOUBT IN THE 
FORECAST. LAST NIGHTS RUN OF THE GFS WAS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE 
EUROPEAN WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING IN THE BASE OF THE 
TROUGH OVER THE CAROLINAS AND SLOWLY RETROGRADING TOWARDS THE 
REGION. HOWEVER THIS MORNINGS RUN OF THE GFS IS VERY DIFFERENT WITH 
THE PATTERN REMAINING ESSENTIALLY THE SAME WITH THE UPPER RIDGE 
REMAINING IN CONTROL...PERHAPS A TROPICAL SYSTEM COMING UP TO VISIT 
US TOWARDS MID WEEK. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY...WILL GO WITH A DRY 
FORECAST INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK UNTIL THE MODELS BECOME MORE CLEAR.

LATEST SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT LOCATED OVER NORTH 
MISSISSIPPI. FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PUSH ENTIRELY THROUGH CWA BY 
12Z. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH BEHIND THE FRONT. 
THE HIGH WILL BRING COOLER AND DRIER AIR TO THE AREA OVER THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS. THE ONE EXCEPTION WILL BE DURING THE THURSDAY-FRIDAY 
TIME PERIOD WHEN MODELS SHOW AN MCS DEVELOPING OVER OKLAHOMA. THE 
MCS IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD AND MAY CLIP THE SOUTHWESTERN 
PART OF THE CWA. WILL CONTINUE THE 20-30 POPS DURING THIS TIME. 
OTHER THAN THAT DRY WEATHER WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF 
THE WEEK. EXPECT MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH HIGH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S AND LOWS IN THE 60S DURING THIS 
TIME.

ON MONDAY...MODELS ARE SHOWING AN UPPER LEVEL LOW RETROGRADING 
WESTWARD FROM GEORGIA/SOUTH CAROLINA TO NORTH MISSISSIPPI BY 
TUESDAY. CURRENT FORECAST HAS 20 POPS ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI FOR 
TUESDAY. THIS MAY NEED TO BE EXPANDED ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA AND

WILL GO AHEAD AND UPDATE TO REMOVE THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FROM
NORTH MS AND THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF WEST TN FOR THE NIGHT. BASED ON
THE SURFACE DEWPOINT GRADIENT...THE COLD FRONT STRETCHES FROM NEAR
GREENVILLE MS TO SAVANNAH TN AND ON INTO MIDDLE TN. DEWPOINTS HAVE
FALLEN INTO THE 50S ACROSS NORTHEAST AR. LAPS DATA INDICATES THE
ATMOSPHERE IS STABILIZING AHEAD OF THE FRONT...AND KNQA 88D SHOWS
THAT THE EARLIER CONVECTION HAS DIED OUT ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA.
WILL FORECAST CLEAR SKIES AREA WIDE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT.
WATER VAPOR SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS DRY AIR ALSO AT THE MID AND HIGH
LEVELS WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE MIDSOUTH. WITH THE LOWER SURFACE
DEWPOINTS...THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH SHOULD ENJOY A LITTLE COOLER AIR BY
SUNRISE WEDNESDAY AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTHEAST.

A FRONT EXTENDS FROM WESTERN INDIANA TO PADUCAH TO MEMPHIS TO
CLARKSDALE. WINDS WERE GUSTING TO 18 KNOTS BEHIND THE FRONT WITH
LITTLE RELIEF FROM THE HEAT. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI WHERE THE GREATEST INSTABILITY AND CONVERGENCE
RESIDES.

THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE ITS EASTWARD PROGRESSION THIS EVENING AND
WILL SHIFT SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 8 PM.
THUNDERSTORMS WILL FOLLOW THE FRONT AND LEAVE SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR IN
ITS WAKE.

THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL AMPLIFY OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY. THIS WILL BRING THE MID SOUTH INTO A NORTHWEST FLOW
PATTERN. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH AN MCS
DEVELOPING OVER KANSAS LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SHOULD THIS COMPLEX
HOLD TOGETHER THROUGH THE DAY...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE A
CHANCE OF AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY EVENING. OTHERWISE
HOT AND DRY CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

EARLY NEXT WEEK...MODELS HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME FIGURING OUT HOW
THE EVOLUTION OF THE NEXT RAIN CHANCES WILL OCCUR. THE HIGHLY
AMPLIFIED RIDGE OVER THE MAJORITY OF THE U.S. LOOKS LIKE IT WILL
BUILD INTO THE EAST COAST TROUGH...CUTTING OFF THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF

A BAND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS STRETCHES FROM SOUTHWESTERN MO
INTO EASTERN OK THIS EVENING. THIS CONVECTION IS LOCATED AHEAD OF A

A VERY WARM DAY TODAY IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. SOME
TEMPERATURES HAVE REACHED THE MID 90S THIS AFTERNOON WITH AT LEAST A
COUPLE MORE HOURS OF HEATING LEFT. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER
THE NORTHERN MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND MOVED QUICKLY NORTH INTO THE
SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH OVER SOUTHEAST MISSOURI AND SOUTHERN
ILLINOIS.

SOUTHWEST LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL STREAM GOOD MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE COLD
FRONT OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...LIMITED INSTABILITY WILL PROBABLY HINDER
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT.
CURRENT FORECAST HANDLES THIS SCENARIO WELL AND SEE NO REASON TO
DEVIATE FROM IT AT THIS TIME. PRE-FRONTAL WARMING A GOOD BET...AS
TIMING OF THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE NORTHWEST PORTIONS OF
THE FORECAST AREA BY MID MORNING AND THROUGH MEMPHIS AROUND 2 PM.
WITH THIS IN MIND...WE FEEL JUSTIFIED WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR VALUES
OF TODAY OVER AREAS ROUGHLY ALONG AND SOUTH OF I-40 AND SLIGHTLY
COOLER NORTH.

ANOTHER REINFORCING SHOT OF COOL AIR WILL ROTATE SOUTHWARD
WEDNESDAY. THE COOLER MORNING WILL LIKELY OCCUR THURSDAY RATHER THAN
WEDNESDAY AS THE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE DELAYED UNTIL THE SECOND PUSH
OF COOLER AIR PUSHES THROUGH. EXPECT WEDNESDAY DAYTIME TEMPERATURES
TO BE PLEASANT FROM THE MID TO UPPER 80S FOR MOST LOCATIONS. THIS
SLIGHTLY COOLER TREND WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

THE LONGER RANGE MODELS ARE HINTING AT SOME CONVECTION FIRING OVER
WESTERN OKLAHOMA/KANSAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS IS AT LEAST THE SECOND
MODEL RUN THAT SHOWS THIS FEATURE. SHOULD IT FORM INTO AN MCS...THE

THE REMNANTS OF ARLENE CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY NORTHEAST THIS
AFTERNOON. RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM HAS NOW ENDED...BUT
ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER CONTINUES OVER MOST OF WEST TENNESSEE AND
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. THIS HAS HELPED KEEP TEMPERATURES COOL TODAY
ACROSS THESE AREAS.

CLOUDS WILL EVENTUALLY CLEAR FROM WEST TO EAST OVERNIGHT AND ONCE
SKIES SCATTER OUT ACROSS EASTERN AREAS...EXPECT AREAS OF FOG TO
DEVELOP. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK OVER THE MID-SOUTH ON MONDAY
IN THE WAKE OF ARLENE ALLOWING FOR PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND WARMER
TEMPERATURES. LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO
WARM BACK INTO THE LOW 90S WEST TO AROUND 90 EAST...WHERE WET SOIL
WILL HOLD TEMPS BACK A BIT. ALSO EXPECT A CU FIELD TO DEVELOP
TOMORROW...ESPECIALLY OVER EASTERN SECTIONS. DRY WEATHER AND VERY
WARM TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED AGAIN ON TUESDAY.

THE UPPER TROUGH NOW POSITIONED OVER THE WESTERN STATES WILL
CONTINUE TO LIFT OUT INTO THE PLAINS STATES ON TUESDAY AND ACROSS
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL HELP
TO SEND A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT.
12Z NAM/GFS BOTH IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF FRONTAL
PASSAGE. IN ADDITION...BOTH MODELS INDICATING LIMITED AMOUNTS OF
MOISTURE IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT...SO ONLY EXPECTING ISOLATED
CONVECTION WITH THE FRONT AT BEST. HAVE ADDED 20 POPS FOR TUESDAY
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE. ALSO BEST UPPER LEVEL
DYNAMICS AND SHEAR SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE AREA...SO THINK ANY
STORMS THAT CAN DEVELOP WILL REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT FOR
WEDNESDAY THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND. THE UPPER TROUGH WILL PERSIST OVER
THE NORTHEAST STATES WITH DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT REMAINING
OVER THE AREA. SO EXPECT DRY WEATHER ALONG WITH LESS HUMIDITY AND

PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE...MAINLY ALONG AND EAST OF A LINE FROM
OBION TO JACKSON TO SELMER EASTWARD AT 15Z. THE RAINFALL INTENSITY
HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS SO HAVE
GONE AHEAD AND CANCELLED THE FLOOD WATCH THAT WAS IN PLACE. THIS
RAIN WILL CONTINUE TO TAPER OFF THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON AND MOST
PLACES SHOULD BE DRY AFTER 20Z.

THE CLOUD COVER WILL TAKE A BIT LONGER TO CLEAR ACROSS THE EASTERN
HALF OF THE AREA...BUT EVEN THESE AREAS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF
NORTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL BECOME PARTLY
CLOUDY BY LATE AFTERNOON. ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA...
SKIES HAVE CLEARED OUT...BUT EXPECT CU FIELD TO DEVELOP OVER THESE
AREAS OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR SO. TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMEST IN THE
WEST...WHERE SKIES WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY AND LESS RAIN HAS FALLEN...
AND COOLEST ACROSS THE EAST...WHERE CLOUDS LINGER LONGEST AND THE
GROUND IS SATURATED FROM LAST NIGHTS RAINFALL. ALSO ADJUSTED
DEWPOINTS DOWN A BIT TO ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT TRENDS. ALL OTHER
FORECAST PARAMETERS LOOK GOOD.

UPDATES TO THE GRIDS AND ZONES HAVE ALREADY BEEN SENT.

TROPICAL STORM ARLENE IS THE MAIN WEATHER FEATURE OF INTEREST THIS
AFTERNOON AND THE AFFECTS FROM THE REMNANTS OF THIS SYSTEM WILL
IMPACT PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH INTO THE WEEKEND. T.S. ARLENE IS
CURRENTLY MAKING LANDFALL NEAR PENSACOLA FLORIDA AT THE CURRENT
TIME AND IS MOVING TO THE NORTH AT ABOUT 13 MPH. AN OUTER RAINBAND
IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE STORM IS ALREADY ENTERING EXTREME EASTERN
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA AND WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY PROGRESS
WESTWARD THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE
AREA...THERE HAVE BEEN MANY MORE BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER AND
SOLAR HEATING HAS LED TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF DIURNAL CONVECTION. THIS
SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS...BEFORE DIMINISHING AFTER
SUNSET.

AS FOR THE FORECAST MODELS AND THEIR HANDLING OF THE TROPICAL
STORM. MODEL GUIDANCE STILL A BIT DIVERGENT ON THE EVENTUAL TRACK
OF THE REMNANTS OF ARLENE. THE 12Z AND EVEN TO SOME EXTENT THE 18Z
NAM WANT TO BRING THE REMNANTS TO THE NORTHWEST...TRACKING THE
SYSTEM OVER MEMPHIS ON SUNDAY. THE 12Z GFS AND THE TROPICAL SUITE
(GFDL...UKMET...BAMS...NOGAPS) ARE FURTHER EAST WITH THE REMNANT
LOW...TRACKING IT NORTHWARD BASICALLY ACROSS EXTREME WESTERN ALABAMA.
CURRENTLY AM FAVORING THE MORE EASTERN TRACK OF THE GFS AND
TROPICAL SUITE AS THE TREND AS OF LATE HAS BEEN TO REMAIN FURTHER
EAST WITH ITS LANDFALL AND IT APPEARS THAT THE SYSTEM WILL TRACK
ALONG A NORTH OR NORTH-NORTHWEST TRACK BETWEEN THE LONGWAVE TROUGH
OVER THE WEST AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE.

A BAND OF HEAVIER RAIN HAS DEVELOPED WELL TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE
CENTER OF ARLENE AND THIS BAND NOW OVER FAR EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA WILL SLOWLY BACK WEST. YET THE FURTHEST WESTWARD
EXTENT OF THIS BAND WILL LIKELY STAY EAST OF MEMPHIS AND I-55 IN
NORTH MISSISSIPPI. SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL LIKELY DEVELOP WEST OF
THIS MAIN BAND...BUT RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD REMAIN ON THE LIGHT
SIDE. FURTHER EAST...ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND WEST
TENNESSEE NEAR THE TENNESSEE RIVER...PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN WILL BE
POSSIBLE TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. RAINFALL TOTALS BETWEEN 2-3 INCHES
WILL BE COMMON ACROSS THESE AREAS...WITH ISOLATED HIGHER AMOUNTS.
THEREFORE HAD NO STRONG REASONING TO DISCONTINUE FLOOD WATCH ISSUED
EARLIER AND WILL LEAVE GOING THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH SAME
AREAS COVERED BY THE WATCH.

WINDS WILL ALSO INCREASE...MAINLY ACROSS EASTERN AREAS...INCLUDING
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND EAST PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE AS THE
REMNANT LOW MOVES CLOSER AND THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS.
CURRENT THINKING IS THAT WINDS WILL INCREASE TO 15-25 MPH WITH GUSTS
BETWEEN 30-35 MPH IN THESE AREAS. ALTHOUGH WINDS WILL BE GUSTY...
BELIEVE WINDS WILL REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA AT THIS TIME.
LATER SHIFTS WILL STILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS THOUGH.

FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD...THE REMNANTS OF ARLENE WILL DEPART THE
AREA LATER SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH A TROPICAL AIRMASS REMAINING IN
PLACE THROUGH TUESDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS EASTERN AREAS. SUBSIDENCE
BEHIND THE PARTING TROPICAL SYSTEM MAY INITIALLY LIMIT OVERALL
CONVECTIVE COVERAGE ON MONDAY...ESPECIALLY WEST...BUT DIURNAL
COVERAGE SHOULD INCREASE IN COVERAGE AGAIN ON TUESDAY. A COLD FRONT

.DISCUSSION...

THE BIG WEATHER STORY THIS MORNING AND FOR THE WEEKEND WILL BE
TROPICAL STORM ARLENE...WHICH IS NEARING THE ALABAMA GULF COAST. THE
OUTER CLOUD SHIELD ASSOCIATED WITH ARLENE HAS ADVANCED WESTWARD INTO
PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AS OF 15Z THIS
MORNING...WITH THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD TO THE
MISSISSIPPI/ALABAMA BORDER AND SLOWLY MOVING WEST. SOME SHOWER
ACTIVITY HAS ALSO BROKEN OUT ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE...MAINLY TO THE
EAST OF JACKSON.

DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO BACK WESTWARD INTO EASTERN
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. WITH THIS IN MIND...
HAVE BUMPED UP POPS ACROSS THESE AREAS. ALSO WILL INCREASE CLOUD
COVER FROM EAST TO WEST IN THE CLOUD GRIDS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON.
OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THERE HAS BEEN A GOOD
AMOUNT OF SUN THIS MORNING. PLAN TO GO WITH 50 POPS OVER THESE
AREAS...WITH MORE DIURNAL SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING DUE TO
LEFT OVER CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES FROM YESTERDAYS STORMS...INCREASING
MOISTURE...AND DAYTIME HEATING. HAVE KEPT TEMPERATURES LOWER IN THE
EAST DUE TO GREATER CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES AND HIGHER WEST
WHERE MORE SOLAR HEATING IS ANTICIPATED.

.UPDATE...

STUBBORN AREA OF CONVECTION OVER NE AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL WILL MEAN 
THAT HIGHER POPS WILL BE NEED IN THE ZONE UPDATE. WILL UPDATE TO 50 
POPS FOR THOSE AREA...20S ELSEWHERE. ZONE PACKAGE WILL BE OUT IN A 
FEW.

HERE IS THE REST OF THE PREVIOUS UPDATE...

CONVECTION IS COMING TO AN END ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA...WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF NE AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL WHERE AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY IS 
SUSTAINING CONVECTION. AS THE OUTFLOW CONTINUES TO MOVE NW...EXPECT 
CONVECTION TO SLOWLY DIMINISH OVER THESE AREAS. WILL ISSUE AN UPDATE 
BETWEEN 04-05Z TO BRING DOWN POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE OVERNIGHT. REST 
OF THE ONGOING FORECAST IS IN GOOD SHAPE.

THE BIGGER FORECAST STORY...ESPECIALLY FOR TOMORROW NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY...WILL BE THE TRACK OF TROPICAL STORM ARLENE. AS OF THIS 
WRITING...ARLENE HAS STRENGTHENED TO 70 MPH AND IS MOVING TOWARD THE 
NW. IT IS 270 MILES SOUTHEAST OF PENSACOLA FL. 

THE QUESTION WILL BE WHERE DOES THE REMNANTS OF ARLENE TRACK? THIS 
WILL HAVE A LARGE IMPACT ON THE AMOUNT OF RAIN THE CWA RECEIVES. THE 
LATEST NHC TRACK IS SLIGHTLY TO THE WEST OF THE PREVIOUS 
TRACK...COMING RATHER CLOSE TO NE MS. THIS WOULD HAVE GREATER 
IMPLICATIONS FOR THE AREA. THERE IS DEFINITELY A HEAVY RAINFALL 
POTENTIAL AND THE HWO COVERS THIS VERY WELL. DECIDED NOT TO ISSUE 
ANY SORT OF FLOOD WATCH AT THIS TIME. THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT CAN 
REEVALUATE...ESPECIALLY AFTER HPC ISSUES THEIR LATEST QPF FORECAST. 
STILL FEEL THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW FAR WEST THE HEAVY RAINS 
WILL MAKE IT. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 342 PM FRI JUN 10 2005...

A SUMMER-LIKE WEATHER PATTERN CONTINUES AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON WITH
DIURNAL CONVECTION ONCE AGAIN DEVELOPING. NOT QUITE AS WIDESPREAD
AS YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME...WITH UPPER LEVEL CONFLUENCE A BIT
STRONGER TODAY BETWEEN THE WESTERN TROUGH AND TROPICAL STORM
ARLENE. STILL EXPECTING ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH HEAVY RAINFALL AND GUSTY
WINDS BEING THE GREATEST THREAT WITH ANY STORMS...AS PWATS ON THE
HIGH SIDE. ALSO CAPE VALUES RANGING FROM 1500 TO 2500 J/KG OVER
MOST OF THE AREA...SO ISOLATED PULSE SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE.

CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE INTO TONIGHT
WITH MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE. BEST CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS EASTERN
SECTIONS OVERNIGHT WITH INCREASING TROPICAL MOISTURE AND LOW-LEVEL
CONVERGENCE PRECEDING TROPICAL STORM ARLENE.

THE BIG WEATHER STORY FOR THE WEEKEND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTS
FROM THE REMNANTS OF ARLENE. 12Z MODEL GUIDANCE INITIALIZED THE
TROPICAL SYSTEM POORLY...WITH THE NAM AND ECMWF FURTHER WEST WITH
LANDFALL AS COMPARED WITH THE GFS. CURRENTLY LIKE 12Z GFS SOLUTION
BETTER AND PREFER A FURTHER EAST SOLUTION AS THE TREND HAS BEEN TO
MOVE ALONG A TRACK FURTHER EASTWARD TODAY. IN ADDITION...THE MEAN
TROUGH/RIDGE CONFIGURATION APPEARS TO SUPPORT THE FURTHER
EASTWARD TRACK AND DOES NOT APPEAR THAT IT WILL CHANGE GREATLY
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

WITH A FURTHER EAST TRACK...THIS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON THE
WEEKEND FORECAST ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH...AS THE GREATEST HEAVY
RAINFALL THREAT WILL BE ALONG AND TO THE EAST OF THE EVENTUAL TRACK
OF THE REMNANTS OF ARLENE. BEST THINKING AT THIS POINT IS THAT ARLENE
WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK NORTH TO NORTH-NORTHWEST MAKING LANDFALL ALONG
THE NORTHERN GULF COAST TOMORROW EVENING. THEN THE REMNANT LOW SHOULD
TRACK NORTH...WITH BEST ESTIMATES ALONG THE EASTERN BORDER OF OUR
CWA...FROM SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. THIS WOULD KEEP THE
GREATEST THREAT FOR VERY HEAVY RAIN TO OUR EAST. STILL...WITH
MOISTURE ADVANCING NORTHWARD IN ADVANCE OF THIS SYSTEM...HAVE DECIDED
TO RAISE POPS TO LIKELY ACROSS EASTERN SECTIONS AND CHANCE POPS IN
THE WEST. ALSO...THE EVENTUAL TRACK AND INTENSITY OF THIS TROPICAL
SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. IF THE SYSTEM TRACKS FURTHER WEST THAN
CURRENTLY EXPECTED...THEN THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE...
ESPECIALLY ACROSS EASTERN AREAS. STAYED TUNED FOR UPDATED INFORMATION
ON THIS STORM SYSTEM THROUGH THE WEEKEND...BUT AT THIS TIME WILL
KEEP QPF VALUES ON THE ORDER OF 1-2 INCHES ACROSS EASTERN AREAS...
WITH LESSER VALUES WEST. WITH THE DRY CONDITIONS AS OF LATE...THESE
TOTALS WILL NOT LIKELY RESULT IN MAJOR FLOODING ISSUES. IF RAINFALL
INTENSITIES ARE GREAT...CANNOT RULE OUT SOME AREAS OF FLASH
FLOODING AND PONDING OF ROADWAYS. THESE RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL
CONTINUE TO BE REVISED AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

FOR NEXT WEEK...A TROPICAL AIRMASS WILL BE LEFT IN THE WAKE OF
ARLENE FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THEREFORE...DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL
ONCE AGAIN BE POSSIBLE FOR THESE TIME PERIODS WITH TEMPERATURES
RISING BACK TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL VALUES. THE NEXT COLD FRONT IS
PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA FOR MID WEEK WITH ADDITIONAL
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. DRY WEATHER AND LOWER
HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT WITH HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDING IN FOR THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

WITH MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE. BEST CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS EASTERN
SECTIONS OVERNIGHT WITH INCREASING TROPICAL MOISTURE AND LOW-LEVEL
CONVERGENCE PRECEDING TROPICAL STORM ARLENE.

THE BIG WEATHER STORY FOR THE WEEKEND WILL CONTINUE TO BE AFFECTS
FROM THE REMNANTS OF ARLENE. 12Z MODEL GUIDANCE INITIALIZED THE
TROPICAL SYSTEM POORLY...WITH THE NAM AND ECMWF FURTHER WEST WITH
LANDFALL AS COMPARED WITH THE GFS. CURRENTLY LIKE 12Z GFS SOLUTION
BETTER AND PREFER A FURTHER EAST SOLUTION AS THE TREND HAS BEEN TO
MOVE ALONG A TRACK FURTHER EASTWARD TODAY. IN ADDITION...THE MEAN
TROUGH/RIDGE CONFIGURATION APPEARS TO SUPPORT THE FURTHER
EASTWARD TRACK AND DOES NOT APPEAR THAT IT WILL CHANGE GREATLY
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

WITH A FURTHER EAST TRACK...THIS WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON THE
WEEKEND FORECAST ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH...AS THE GREATEST HEAVY
RAINFALL THREAT WILL BE ALONG AND TO THE EAST OF THE EVENTUAL TRACK
OF THE REMNANTS OF ARLENE. BEST THINKING AT THIS POINT IS THAT ARLENE
WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK NORTH TO NORTH-NORTHWEST MAKING LANDFALL ALONG
THE NORTHERN GULF COAST TOMORROW EVENING. THEN THE REMNANT LOW SHOULD
TRACK NORTH...WITH BEST ESTIMATES ALONG THE EASTERN BORDER OF OUR
CWA...FROM SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. THIS WOULD KEEP THE
GREATEST THREAT FOR VERY HEAVY RAIN TO OUR EAST. STILL...WITH
MOISTURE ADVANCING NORTHWARD IN ADVANCE OF THIS SYSTEM...HAVE DECIDED
TO RAISE POPS TO LIKELY ACROSS EASTERN SECTIONS AND CHANCE POPS IN
THE WEST. ALSO...THE EVENTUAL TRACK AND INTENSITY OF THIS TROPICAL
SYSTEM IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE. IF THE SYSTEM TRACKS FURTHER WEST THAN
CURRENTLY EXPECTED...THEN THE HEAVY RAIN THREAT WOULD BE POSSIBLE...
ESPECIALLY ACROSS EASTERN AREAS. STAYED TUNED FOR UPDATED INFORMATION
ON THIS STORM SYSTEM THROUGH THE WEEKEND...BUT AT THIS TIME WILL
KEEP QPF VALUES ON THE ORDER OF 1-2 INCHES ACROSS EASTERN AREAS...
WITH LESSER VALUES WEST. WITH THE DRY CONDITIONS AS OF LATE...THESE
TOTALS WILL NOT LIKELY RESULT IN MAJOR FLOODING ISSUES. IF RAINFALL
INTENSITIES ARE GREAT...CANNOT RULE OUT SOME AREAS OF FLASH
FLOODING AND PONDING OF ROADWAYS. THESE RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL
CONTINUE TO BE REVISED AS NEW INFORMATION BECOMES AVAILABLE.

FOR NEXT WEEK...A TROPICAL AIRMASS WILL BE LEFT IN THE WAKE OF
ARLENE FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THEREFORE...DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL
ONCE AGAIN BE POSSIBLE FOR THESE TIME PERIODS WITH TEMPERATURES
RISING BACK TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL VALUES. THE NEXT COLD FRONT IS
PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA FOR MID WEEK WITH ADDITIONAL
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. DRY WEATHER AND LOWER
HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT WITH HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDING IN FOR THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING MUCH LESS CLOUD COVER THIS
MORNING AS COMPARED TO YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME. GREATEST CLOUD
COVERAGE THIS MORNING HAS REMAINED OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL. WITH LESS CLOUD COVER IN PLACE ELSEWHERE...SHOULD
SEE TEMPERATURES WARM AGAIN TO NEAR 90 DEGREES OVER MOST AREAS. ONLY
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL MAY SEE TEMPERATURES
HELD BACK IN THE UPPER 80S. WITH MORE SUN...WOULD BE TEMPTED
TO GO A BIT HIGHER ON TEMPS...BUT WITH YESTERDAYS RAIN ADDING
MOISTURE TO THE SOIL...EVAPOTRANSPORATION WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES
FROM GETTING MUCH HIGHER THAN 90 DEGREES. WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE
ADJUSTED TEMPERATURE GRIDS TO FIT THIS SCENARIO.

AS FOR PRECIPITATION CHANCES...HAVE ADJUSTED GRIDS TO REFLECT 50
POPS AREAWIDE. SEE NO REASON TO JUSTIFY HIGHER OR LOWER POPS IN ANY
ONE SPECIFIC AREA OVER ANOTHER. THE WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS
THAT HAS BEEN STALLED OVER THE REGION REMAINS IN PLACE...AND THIS
COMBINED WITH THE CONTINUED HIGH HUMIDITY LEVELS AND DAYTIME
HEATING SHOULD TRIGGER SCATTERED THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY ACROSS THE
AREA THIS AFTERNOON. CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD FOCUS ALONG OLD
CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES LEFT AROUND FROM YESTERDAYS ACTIVITY
AND IN AREAS THAT RECEIVE MAXIMUM HEATING. WITH HIGH PRECIPITABLE
WATER VALUES AND HIGH CAPE IN PLACE...EXPECTING STORMS TO ONCE AGAIN
BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL...GUSTY WINDS...AND
POSSIBLE SMALL HAIL. HAVE ADDRESSED THE SPECIFICS IN THE LATEST HWO.
ALL OTHER FORECAST PARAMETERS LOOK GOOD.

PRESENTLY...RADAR IS SHOWING SHOWERS MOVING NORTH OVER NORTH
MISSISSIPPI INTO SOUTHERN WEST TENNESSEE. WITH THIS IN MIND AND
CONSIDERING THAT WE HAVE A WEAK UPPER TROUGH OVER THE MIDSOUTH...
THINK THERE WILL BE A GOOD ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
AGAIN TODAY LIKE YDA. ACTIVITY SHOULD SLACK SOME TONIGHT DUE TO
DIURNAL EFFECTS.

BOTH NAM AND GFS INDICATE MOISTURE FROM TROPICAL STORM ARLENE
COULD BE PUSHED UP INTO THIS AREA SATURDAY ON THROUGH THE
WEEKEND. BELIEVE ARLENE WILL TRACK NORTHWARD IN MISSISSIPPI. THIS

.UPDATE...
IT HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH A GOOD DEAL OF 
DIURNAL CONVECTION. FLOODING WAS REPORTED IN EAST SHELBY COUNTY AND 
CRAIGHEAD COUNTY...BUT MEM AIRPORT ONLY RECEIVED 0.20 INCHES. SO GOES
THE WAYS OF DIURNAL CONVECTION.

SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IS SLOW TO QUIET DOWN THIS EVENING 
DUE TO NUMEROUS OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES HELPING TO SUSTAIN CONVECTION. 
CURRENT FORECAST HAS 50 POPS THROUGH MIDNIGHT...TAPERING OFF TO 30 
POPS AFTERWARDS. THIS SEEMS REASONABLE AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES 
FOR THE TIME BEING. 

TEMP FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK. TEMP/DPTS ALREADY CLOSE TOGETHER AND 
DONT EXPECT MUCH OF A DROP OVERNIGHT. PATCHY FOG MAY BE AN ISSUE 
OVERNIGHT AND WILL MONITOR THE SITUATION.

WILL WATCH CONVECTIVE TRENDS AND WILL PROBABLY MAKE AN UPDATE TO THE 
GRIDS AND ZONES JUST BEFORE 05Z.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED 338 PM CDT JUNE 9 2005...

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE
MID-SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. THESE STORMS HAVE BEEN UNORGANIZED AND OF
THE PULSE VARIETY...AND WITH CAPE VALUES RANGING BETWEEN 2000-3000
J/KG A FEW OF THESE STORMS MAY BRIEFLY BECOME SEVERE...WITH WET
MICROBURST AND MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL THE MOST LIKELY SEVERE THREATS
THROUGH EARLY THIS EVENING. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BEGIN TO DIMINISH
LATE THIS EVENING WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.

THE SUMMER-LIKE PATTERN OVER THE MID-SOUTH WILL CONTINUE INTO THE
FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND AS THE BERMUDA HIGH REMAINS IN PLACE OVER
THE SOUTHEAST U.S. AND KEEPS THE AIRMASS OVER THE AREA VERY WARM
AND HUMID. A WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL REMAIN STALLED ACROSS THE
REGION THROUGH SATURDAY. SO WILL STICK WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST
THROUGH SATURDAY. EXPECT CONTINUED PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND DAILY
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WHICH WILL BE MOST ABUNDANT
WITH THE HIGHEST COVERAGE DURING PEAK MAXIMUM DAYTIME HEATING. ONCE
AGAIN...HIGH CAPE VALUES BETWEEN 2000-3000 J/KG BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON
WILL LEAD TO ANOTHER ROUND OF POSSIBLE PULSE SEVERE STORMS. THE
MAIN THREATS FRIDAY AFTERNOON WILL ONCE AGAIN BE WET MICROBURSTS AND
MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL.

BEYOND SATURDAY...THE FORECAST WILL HINGE ON THE CONTINUED
DEVELOPMENT AND EXACT TRACK OF TROPICAL STORM ARLENE. CURRENT MODEL
GUIDANCE SHOWING A TRACK OVER EASTERN PORTION OF OUR FORECAST AREA...
AS THE TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVES ALONG THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE
BUILDING UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM CURRENTLY OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC. THIS UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS FORECAST TO REMAIN
IN PLACE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE 12Z NAM IS WEAKER AND FASTER WITH
THE TROPICAL STORM AS COMPARED WITH THE 12Z GFS/ECMWF. THE 12Z
ECMWF/GFS ALSO FURTHER WEST WITH LANDFALL ALONG MISSISSIPPI GULF
COAST AS COMPARED WITH 12Z NAM...WHICH WAS FURTHER EAST. LATEST 18Z
NAM NOW ALSO FURTHER WEST. THE EVENTUAL TRACK AND STRENGTH OF THIS
SYSTEM WILL DETERMINE ITS ULTIMATE IMPACTS ON THE MID-SOUTH.
CURRENTLY PREFER THE SLOWER MODEL SOLUTIONS AS THE SYSTEM REMAINS
OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN SEA THIS EVENING...EVEN THOUGH SYSTEM
SHOULD INCREASE ITS FORWARD SPEED A BIT. SINCE THIS SYSTEM IS STILL
DEVELOPING AND A COUPLE OF DAYS OUT...HAVE DECIDED TO ONLY INCREASE
POPS SLIGHTLY...ESPECIALLY OVER EASTERN SECTIONS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT
AND SUNDAY. IF WESTWARD MODEL TRENDS CONTINUE TOMORROW...WILL NEED
TO RAMP UP POPS AREAWIDE FOR THIS TIME PERIOD. PREFER TO TAKE A
WAIT AND SEE APPROACH FOR NOW...AND MAKE MAJOR POP DECISION FRIDAY
AFTERNOON. BUT COULD BE A WET PERIOD FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY
IF SYSTEM GOES OVERHEAD OR TO THE WEST. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE
NORMAL...BUT WILL BE HELD DOWN BY ANY RAINFALL.

FOR MONDAY AND BEYOND...TROPICAL AIRMASS WILL REMAIN IN PLACE BEHIND
THE DEPARTURE OF THE TROPICAL SYSTEM. THEREFORE...EXPECT MORE
DIURNAL CONVECTION DURING THE DAY MONDAY WITH VERY WARM TEMPERATURES
AND HIGH HUMIDITY LEVELS. NEXT COLD FRONT PROGGED FOR TUESDAY...
WITH MORE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL
FOLLOW FOR THE MIDDLE TO END OF NEXT WEEK...BRINGING DRIER WEATHER
AND LOWER HUMIDITY LEVELS.

CONVECTION LINGERS ACROSS MAINLY NORTHWEST PORTIONS OF THE MID-

THE FORECAST INTO THE WEEKEND CAN BE SUMMED UP AS PERSISTENCE. A 
DECAYING MCS THAT DEVELOPED OVER EASTERN MISSOURI PUSHED THROUGH THE 
REGION OVERNIGHT. A SECOND MCS DEVELOPED OVER SOUTHEAST KANSAS INTO 
SOUTHWEST MISSOURI WITH ITS OUTFLOW HEADED TOWARDS THE REGION. A 
POSITIVE VORT MAX IS POSITIONED SQUARELY OVER THE REGION AND THE 
ATMOSPHERE REMAINS MOIST AND UNSTABLE. THE FORECAST TODAY WILL BE 
DICTATED BY MESOSCALE FEATURES SUCH AS OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES THAT 
WILL PLAY A ROLE AS THE ATMOSPHERE BEGINS TO HEAT UP. WITH THAT 
SAID...LOOKS LIKE EVERYBODY WILL HAVE EQUAL CHANCES OF RAIN TODAY. 
MADE LITTLE CHANGES TO THE TEMP FORECAST SINCE TEMPS HAVE BEEN IN 
THE 90S WITH THE AIR MASS THUNDERSTORMS. SEVERE POTENTIAL REMAINS 
ISOLATED DUE TO THE WEAK MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES...WIND SHEAR AND WEAK 
UPPER LEVEL WINDS. AS WAS THE CASE YESTERDAY...A STORM OR TWO COULD 
BECOME SEVERE WITH LOCALLY DAMAGING WINDS...HAIL UP TO NICKELS AND 
TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS POSSIBLE.

UPPED POPS TO 40 FOR TONIGHT SINCE IT SEEMS LIKE THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY IS NOT QUICKLY DISSIPATING AFTER SUNSET. AS MOIST AND 
UNSTABLE AS THE ATMOSPHERE IS...IT HAS TAKEN A WHILE FOR STORMS TO 
SIMMER DOWN. FRIDAY/SATURDAY ARE LIKELY A REPEAT OF TODAY WITH 
MODELS SHOWING THE UPPER FLOW BECOMING MORE SOUTHERLY AND A 
CONTINUED AREA OF POSITIVE VORTICITY OVER THE REGION. A TROPICAL 
SYSTEM SHOULD MAKE LANDFALL SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY SOMEWHERE ALONG 
THE GULF COAST FROM NEAR NEW ORLEANS INTO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. THE 
REMNANTS OF THIS SYSTEM SHOULD MOVE DUE NORTH ONCE IT MAKES LANDFALL 
SO THE FORECAST FOR SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WILL LARGELY DEPEND UPON 
WHERE LANDFALL OCCURS. GUT FEELING IS THAT LANDFALL MAY BE MORE 
TOWARDS THE ALABAMA/FLORIDA SHORE RESULTING IN BETTER RAIN CHANCES 
EAST OF THE DELTA. TOWARDS MID WEEK GFS/EUROPEAN SUGGEST THAT A 
FRONT MAY ARRIVE BRINGING AN AIR MASS CHANGE TO THE REGION FOR THAT 
LATTER HALF OF NEXT WEEK.

.UPDATE...
DIURNAL CONVECTION BEGINNING TO DIMINISH OVER THE REGION WITH 
ACTIVITY STILL LINGERING NEAR THE TN RIVER AND NE MISSISSIPPI. 
EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE DIMINISHING WITH THE LOSS OF 
DAYTIME HEATING.

TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA...CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE WEAKENING MCS THAT 
IS CURRENTLY MOVING SOUTH TOWARD THE AREA. APPEARS CONVECTION IS 
BEING SUSTAINED ALONG AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY. THE COMBINATION OF A 
SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW INTO THE SYSTEM AND 1500-2500 J/KG OF CAPE WILL 
SUSTAIN THIS LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS IT MOVES INTO THE 
CWA...ALTHOUGH THERE SHOULD BE A WEAKENING TREND WITH INSTABILITY 
SLOWLY DECREASING AS WE HEAD FURTHER INTO THE EVENING. BEST TIMING 
PLACES THE LINE INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...THE MISSOURI 
BOOTHEEL...AND NORTHWEST TENNESSEE BY 0230Z. WILL UPDATE FORECAST 
FOR 50 POPS NORTH TO 30 POPS SOUTH. 

REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. NO CHANGES PLANNED FOR TEMPS AT

ENOUGH YET TO MENTION IN ZONES. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR. UPDATE OUT 
SHORTLY.

CUMULUS FIELD HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE MIDSOUTH AND ISOLATED AFTERNOON
CONVECTION OCCURRING. TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW 90S MOST AREAS THAT ARE
NOT RECEIVING PRECIPITATION.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
ONGOING ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI AND MCS OVER
NORTHERN MISSOURI...INDICATES A THREAT OF PRECIPITATION ACROSS MUCH
OF THE CWA AT ONE POINT OR ANOTHER DURING THE NIGHT TONIGHT. WILL
KEEP CURRENT 30 POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA...AND NOT GET PICKY ABOUT
THE TIMING.

SHEAR AXIS IN THE MID-LEVELS APPEARS TO REMAIN JUST ABOUT STATIONARY
THROUGH FRIDAY. AFTERNOON CAPES THURSDAY AND FRIDAY EXPECTED TO RANGE
FROM ABOUT 2500 ON THE NAM...TO NEAR 4000 ON GFS. NOT ALL THAT MUCH
DIFFERENT THAN TODAY. CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES APPEAR TO BE AROUND 90
DEGREES THROUGH FRIDAY.

PLAN ON A PERSISTENCE TYPE FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY...SINCE VERY
LITTLE IS CHANGING. THIS WOULD INDICATE DIURNALLY BASED CONVECTION...
FROM ABOUT 17Z TO 03Z. WILL NOT MAKE MAJOR TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS...
ALTHOUGH AREAS THAT END UP UNDER THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE DAY WILL
NOT REACH FORECAST LEVELS.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER FRIDAY)...
SHEAR AXIS EITHER DISSIPATES OR MOVES NORTH OUT OF THE AREA FRIDAY
NIGHT...DEPENDING ON THE CHOICE OF MODELS. AIRMASS ITSELF NOT
CHANGING MUCH...SO WILL HOLD SCATTERED POPS IN FOR SATURDAY.

AFTER SATURDAY...UNCERTAINTY FACTOR GETS LARGER. QUESTION WILL BE
WHAT CURRENT TROPICAL CIRCULATION IN THE CARRIBEAN ENDS UP DOING.
MODEL DISCUSSIONS INDICATE SYSTEM INITIALIZED TOO FAR WEST. MOST
MODEL SOLUTIONS I HAVE LOOKED AT INDICATE LANDFALL ALONG THE GULF
COAST SATURDAY OR SUNDAY. STILL A RATHER WIDE SPREAD IN POSSIBLE
SOLUTIONS. IF GFS VERIFIES...IT COULD BE RATHER WET ON SATURDAY
AND SUNDAY...WITH LANDFALL NEAR NEW ORLEANS. NCEP NOT DISCOUNTING
THIS SOLUTION YET...AS CANADIAN ISNT FAR OFF OF IT. HURRICANE MODELS
TRACK SYSTEM A COUPLE OF HUNDRED MILES EAST OF GFS/NAM SOLUTIONS.

WILL DELAY RAISING POPS FOR THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK...UNTIL
WE HAVE A LITTLE MORE DEFINED SYSTEM. WILL LET CURRENT FORECAST FOR
SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY RIDE FOR THE MOST PART.

AS FLOW BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...A COLD FRONT MAY
GET DRAGGED THROUGH THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS WOULD INDICATE
THAT WEDNESDAY WOULD BE DRY BEHIND THE FRONT. NO BIG TEMPERATURE
SWINGS IN THE EXTENDED.

ONGOING CONVECTION IS TO THE EAST OF THE TENNESSEE RIVER.
TEMPERATURES AT 15Z GENERALLY IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S WITH
SOUTHWEST WINDS. DEWPOINTS UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S.

WEAK SHEAR AXIS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE ACROSS OUR AREA THROUGH AT
LEAST FRIDAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS FOR MEMPHIS INDICATE THAT THE
AIRMASS IS CERTAINLY CAPABLE OF PRODUCING CONVECTION. RUC SOUNDING
MORE UNSTABLE THAN THE NAM WITH CAPES 4000 ON THE RUC WITH 2500 ON
THE NAM THIS AFTERNOON.

SEE NO REASON TO MAKE MUCH CHANGE TO GOING FORECAST. NO UPDATES

258 AM CDT WED JUN 8 2005

.DISCUSSION...

AN ELONGATED AREA OF POSITIVE VORTICITY ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK UPPER 
SHORTWAVE EXTENDS FROM SOUTHEAST MISSOURI THROUGH ARKANSAS AND INTO 
LOUISIANA THIS MORNING. AN AREA OF NEGATIVE VORTICITY EXTENDS FROM 
WEST TENNESSEE INTO MOST OF MISSISSIPPI. GENERALLY THE UPPER AIR 
PATTERN SHOWS POLAR JET EXTENDING FROM THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS 
THROUGH THE UPPER MIDWEST. THE SUBTROPICAL JET RUNS FROM SOUTHERN 
TEXAS INTO AN UPPER LOW IN THE SOUTHERN GULF WHICH MAY EVOLVE INTO 
THE FIRST TROPICAL DISTURBANCE IN THE ATLANTIC BASIN THIS YEAR. 

MODELS SHOW THE ELONGATED VORT GRADUALLY MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE 
REGION TODAY. ALTHOUGH UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE WEAK...THERE IS ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY (LIS AROUND -4 AND CAPE 2000-2500J/KG) IN PLACE FOR 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO ONCE AGAIN DEVELOP. SEVERE 
POTENTIAL IS LOW DUE TO THE WEAK UPPER WINDS (5-10KTS) AND WEAK MID 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES THAT ARE AROUND 5.5C/KM. GIVEN THE LI AND CAPE...A 
STORM OR TWO COULD STILL RESULT IN A WET MICROBURST WITH VERY 
LOCALIZED WIND DAMAGE AND FAIRLY SMALL HAIL. THE TREND THE PAST 
COUPLE DAYS IN THIS PATTERN HAS BEEN FOR HIGHS TO BE NEAR 90 OR IN 
THE LOWER 90S AND WITH NO LOW CLOUDS THIS MORNING TO HINDER TEMPS 
THIS LOOKS REASONABLE FOR TODAY.

BASICALLY FORECASTING PERSISTENCE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK WITH 
MODELS SHOWING THE ELONGATED AREA OF POSITIVE VORTICITY REMAINING 
FIXED OVER THE AREA. THE FORECAST WILL LARGELY BE DEPENDENT UPON THE 
MESOSCALE FEATURES LIKE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES AND CONVECTIVE VORTS 
WHICH ARE DIFFICULT TO PINPOINT AT THIS TIME.

EUROPEAN/GFS/ETA ALL HINTING AT A TROPICAL SYSTEM DEVELOPING NEAR 
THE YUCATAN CHANNEL LATER THIS WEEK. THE GFS IS VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH 
THE SYSTEM AND CONTINUES TO SHOW LANDFALL IN THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER BASIN ON SATURDAY WITH THE REMNANTS MOVING NORTH THROUGH THE 
BASIN ON SUNDAY. ETA/EUROPEAN MORE CONSERVATIVE IN THE NORTHERN 
MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM. OTHERWISE...THE WEATHER PATTERN OVER THE 
CONUS LOOKS MAINLY UNCHANGED WITH A BROAD TROUGH REMAINING OVER THE 
WESTERN US AND A RIDGE OVER THE EAST.

.UPDATE...

AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING ACROSS EAST CENTRAL ARKANSAS HAS SPARKED 
A CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING. THIS CONVECTION
HAS MAINLY AFFECTED OUR CWA IN AREAS ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 
40 IN EASTERN ARKANSAS. A SUBTLE 500 MB SHORTWAVE OVER NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS HAS ALSO AIDED THIS ACTIVITY. CONVECTION IS BEGINNING TO 
DIMINISH WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING AND WE EXPECT THIS TREND 
TO CONTINUE. CURRENT FORECAST HAS CHANCE POPS WEST OF THE RIVER AND 
WILL LEAVE AS IS FOR NOW DUE TO THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY AND CONVECTION 
MOVING TOWARD NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. IT IS QUITE POSSIBLE THAT POPS CAN 
BE LOWERED LATE THIS EVENING...BUT WILL MONITOR CONVECTIVE TRENDS FOR
NOW.

WILL TAKE ALL POPS OUT EAST OF THE RIVER...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
EXTREME NW MS. ALL TSTM ACTIVITY ENDED AND DO NO EXPECT ANY 
ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT. THE REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS 
GOOD WITH ANOTHER WARM AND HUMID NIGHT ON TAP. DID ADJUST SKY GRIDS 
TO ACCOUNT FOR CURRENT ANALYSIS. ZONE UPDATE WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED 318 PM TUE JAN 7 2005...

MUCH LESS CONVECTION THAN YESTERDAY...BUT WE STILL ARE SEEING
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. LAPS INDICATES CAPES ARE AROUND 2000 J/KG
AND 12Z LZK SOUNDING SHOWED A PRECIPITABLE WATER OF 1.66 INCHES.
THUNDERSTORMS ARE DEVELOPING DUE TO AFTERNOON HEATING. IN ADDITION...
THERE IS A WEAK SHORT WAVE FROM SOUTHERN MO INTO WEST TN HELPING TO
SET OFF THUNDERSTORMS.

FOR TONIGHT...WILL MENTION ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS.
WEAK SHORT WAVE LOCATED THROUGH WEST TN THIS AFTERNOON WILL MOVE
EAST-NORTHEASTWARD OUT OF OUR AREA THIS EVENING. IN
ADDITION...CONVECTION WILL DIMINISH WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.
ANOTHER SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED BY THE MODELS TO APPROACH FROM THE
WEST AND TO AFFECT MAINLY THE WEST HALF OF OUR FORECAST AREA LATER
TONIGHT. AS A RESULT...WILL CONTINUE 30 PERCENT POPS FOR THE ENTIRE
NIGHT FOR THE WEST HALF OF THE MIDSOUTH.

DO NOT REALLY SEE MUCH CHANGE IN THE WEATHER FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.
TIMING AND PINPOINTING MINOR SHORT WAVES REALLY BECOMES DIFFICULT
AFTER TOMORROW. FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY...THE SHORT WAVE TO OUR
WEST MOVES INTO THE MIDSOUTH...AND STALLS OVER US ESTABLISHING A
WEAKNESS IN THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST AND THE
UPPER LEVEL HIGH TO OUR SOUTHWEST. WILL CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD AS THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS
MOIST AND UNSTABLE. GFS INDICATES MORE RIDGING OVER THE MIDSOUTH
FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...SO POPS WILL BE A LITTLE LOWER DURING THIS
TIME.

SOME OF THE MODELS ARE INDICATING TROPICAL DEVELOPMENT IN THE
NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN MOVING TOWARD THE NORTH-CENTRAL GULF COAST OVER
THE WEEKEND. THE GFS IS THE STRONGEST WITH THE SURFACE DEVELOPMENT IN
THE GULF. SATELLITE DOES INDICATE CONVECTION OVER THE NORTHWEST
CARIBBEAN THIS AFTERNOON. CAN NOT DISCOUNT THIS MOISTURE GRADUALLY
WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE MIDSOUTH AROUND THE BERMUDA HIGH LATE
THIS WEEKEND OR EARLY NEXT WEEK.

CURRENT FORECAST IS ON TRACK AND NO UPDATES NEEDED AT THIS TIME.
LARGE SCALE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS CENTERED ALONG THE SOUTHEASTERN
UNITED STATES COAST WITH AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN
US. AN EMBEDDED WEAK SHORT WAVE IN WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT IS LOCATED
OVER EASTERN AR. THIS SHORT WAVE WITH INTERACT WITH THE MOIST AND
UNSTABLE AIR MASS COVERING THE MIDSOUTH TO CAUSE SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON. 12Z LZK SOUNDING INDICATED POTENTIAL
CAPES THIS AFTERNOON OF ABOUT 1700 J/KG. THE PRECIPITABLE WATER FROM
THE LZK SOUNDING IS 1.66 INCHES...A LITTLE HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY.
THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP COULD PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AS
FLOW AT 500 MB IS ONLY ABOUT 5 KNOTS. THERE IS QUITE A BIT OF LOW
CLOUDS IN PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS MORNING...BUT THINK THESE CLOUDS
WILL BREAK UP...AND PARTLY CLOUDY WITH SUFFICE FOR SKY COVER. UPPER
80S STILL LOOKS GOOD FOR HIGHS WITH CLOUD COVER AND HIGHER MOISTURE

ISSUED 314 AM CDT TUE JUN 7 2005

FORECAST OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL BE LARGELY DETERMINED BY
MESOSCALE FEATURES. THE UPPER PATTERN IS GENERALLY CHARACTERIZED BY
AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN US WITH A RIDGE OVER THE REMAINDER
OF THE COUNTRY. THERE ARE TWO AREAS OF POSITIVE VORTICITY NEAR THE
REGION. THE FIRST REGION EXTENDS FROM EAST TENNESSEE OVER MUCH OF
ALABAMA AND INTO EAST CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. THE SECOND AREA IS ACROSS
CENTRAL ARKANSAS. NEGATIVE VORTICITY EXISTS OVER THE MIDSOUTH
REGION. A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX ASSOCIATED WITH THE VORT MAX OVER
ARKANSAS FELL APART AS IT REACHED THE NEGATIVE VORT MAX OVER THE
REGION. BOTH GFS AND MESOETA PICK UP THESE FEATURES VERY WELL.

EXPECT THE VORT MAX OVER ARKANSAS TO GRADUALLY PUSH INTO THE
MIDSOUTH TODAY. KEY FEATURE MISSING FROM THIS MORNING AS OPPOSED TO
YESTERDAY MORNING IS THAT THE REGION LAY IN THE ENTRANCE REGION TO A
50KT 250MB JET. THIS AIDED CONVECTION EARLY YESTERDAY MORNING DURING
THE PREDAWN HOURS. THE WIND FIELDS THIS MORNING ARE NOTICEABLY
WEAKER WITH ONLY ABOUT 10KTS OVER THE AREA. AS A RESULT...EXPECT
THAT DEVELOPMENT WILL MAINLY HOLD OFF UNTIL AT LEAST MID MORNING
WHEN SOLAR HEATING CAN WORK WITH THE VORT MAX TO TRIGGER STORMS.
FEEL THAT THERE ARE LESSER CHANCES ACROSS NORTHWEST TENNESSEE TODAY
WITH THE MESOETA SHOWING THE NEGATIVE VORT POSITIONED OVER NORTHWEST
TENNESSEE WITH CONVECTION BREAKING OUT ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THE
NEGATIVE VORT. DO NOT FEEL THAT THERE IS A WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER
THREAT DUE TO THE WEAK UPPER WIND FIELDS. ALTHOUGH FREQUENT
LIGHTING...HEAVY DOWNPOURS AND SMALL HAIL ARE POSSIBLE. DAYTIME
TEMPS WILL BE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON THE AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE.
YESTERDAY JONESBORO REACHED 95 WITH NO RAIN WHILE TUPELO ONLY 83
WITH RAIN AROUND FOR A GOOD PORTION OF THE MORNING AND EARLY
AFTERNOON. GENERALLY WILL SHOOT FOR UPPER 80S TO NEAR 90 WITH SOME
HEATING EXPECTED THIS MORNING AND CONVECTION AND CLOUDS LIMITING
HEATING THIS AFTERNOON.

CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH QUICKLY THIS EVENING WITH THE LOSS OF THE
SOLAR HEATING AND UPPER WINDS STILL WEAK. THE POSITIVE VORT OVER
ARKANSAS SHOULD BE NEAR THE TENNESSEE RIVER BY WEDNESDAY MORNING
THUS BETTER CHANCES FURTHER EAST. OVERALL PATTERN REMAINS LARGELY
UNCHANGED THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. SPLIT UPPER FLOW WILL PREVAIL OVER
THE REGION WITH THE NORTHERN BRANCH OF THE JET RUNNING FROM THE
SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST AND TH SOUTHERN BRANCH
RUNNING FROM SOUTH TEXAS AND DIPPING WELL INTO THE GULF. THIS
PATTERN SHOULD CARRY MOST OF THE STRONGER SYSTEMS NORTH AND SOUTH OF
THE AREA. THE AIRMASS OVER THE REGION WILL REMAIN RATHER MOIST AND
UNSTABLE WITH AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE EVERY DAY. THE GFS
CAME IN WITH A RATHER INTERESTING SOLUTION FOR THE END OF THE WEEK
WITH WHAT APPEARS TO BE THE FIRST TROPICAL SYSTEM IN THE ATLANTIC
BASIN OF THE YEAR DEVELOPING IN THE GULF AND MAKING LANDFALL IN THE
NORTHERN GULF OVER THE WEEKEND. THE EUROPEAN AND UKMET DO NOT
SUPPORT SUCH A SOLUTION AND THE CANADIAN SHOWS DEVELOPMENT BUT
REMAINING MUCH FURTHER SOUTH AND REMAINING IN THE GULF. THE GFS
APPEARS TO BE WORKING OFF OF A MUCH STRONGER SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE
JET THAN THE OTHER MODELS. EXTENDED FORECAST FOR NOW WILL BE ONE OF

.UPDATE...
AN AREA OF CONVECTION OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 
MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE VORTEX LOCATED OVER THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE 
STATE. THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE MOVING EAST TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH. 
A WEAKENING TREND HAS ALREADY BEGUN ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE

SYSTEM NOW THAT INSTABILITY IS DECREASING WITH THE SUN SETTING. WILL 
UPDATE POPS TO CHANCE WEST OF THE RIVER. WILL MAINTAIN A SLIGHT

W TN AND N MS...ALREADY HAVING BEEN WORKED OVER BY PREVIOUS 
CONVECTION. STILL CANNOT RULE OUT ISOLATE CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE MCV AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION OVERNIGHT. 

THE WHOLE AREA SHOULD BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
HOURS WITH THE BLOWOFF FROM CONVECTION TO THE SOUTH AND WEST. THE

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED 326 PM MON JUN 6 2005...

TODAY HAS BEEN A DAY OF MESOSCALE FEATURES. WEAK UPPER LOW / VORT MAX
LOCATED OVER NORTHERN MS THIS AFTERNOON IS MOVING EAST-
NORTHEASTWARD. COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
FEATURE MOVED NORTHWARD THROUGH NORTH MS AND AND MUCH OF WEST TN
THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON...BUT HAS NOW FALLEN APART.
MEANWHILE...A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX MOVED THROUGH MISSOURI
THIS MORNING. THIS COMPLEX CAUSED A SURFACE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY WHICH
NOW STRETCHES FROM SOUTHERN KY THROUGH SOUTHEAST MO INTO NORTHERN
AR. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FIRED ALONG THIS BOUNDARY WHERE CAPES WERE
GREATER THAN 2000 J/KG. THE STORMS ARE MOVING MOSTLY EAST BUT
PERHAPS WITH SOME SOUTHERN MOVEMENT ALSO. IF THAT IS NOT ENOUGH...
THERE IS A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE VORT MAX MOVING INTO WESTERN AR.
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ALSO FIRED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS FEATURE...BUT
EXPECT THEY WILL DIMINISH AFTER DARK. WE WILL MOSTLY LIKELY DEAL WITH
THIS FEATURE TOMORROW (OR MAYBE LATE TONIGHT)...ALTHOUGH DO NOT
EXPECT TOMORROWS SHOWERS / THUNDERSTORMS TO BE AS WIDESPREAD AS
TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...WILL MENTION 30 PERCENT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FROM
PART OF NORTHEAST AR INTO NORTHWEST TN AS THE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG
THE NORTHERN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY SINK SOUTHWARD THIS EVENING.
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA...WILL MENTION 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS / THUNDERSTORMS TO COVER LINGERING AFTERNOON CONVECTION...
AND TO COVER ANY CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS LATER TONIGHT AS THE
WESTERN AR TROUGH APPROACHES THE MIDSOUTH.

FOR TUESDAY...VORT MAX / UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER WESTERN AR WILL
BE OVER THE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL CAUSE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS AS IT
COMBINES WITH THE MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS COVERING THE AREA.
HOWEVER...THINK THE AREAS THAT RECEIVED WIDESPREAD RAIN TODAY
WILL SEE MORE SUN TUESDAY. AS A RESULT...HEAT AND HUMIDITY WILL
RETURN TO THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH.

FOR WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY...HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT STRENGTHENS OFF
THE ATLANTIC COAST WITH SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH. CAN NOT PIN DOWN ANY SHORT WAVES AFFECTING US DURING THIS
TIME. AS A RESULT...WILL HAVE POPS RANGING FROM 20 TO 30 PERCENT
WITH THE HIGHER POPS TO THE EAST WHERE THE MOISTURE IS A LITTLE
GREATER.

THE HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT STRENGTHENS OVER THE MIDSOUTH FRIDAY
HELPING TO KEEP THUNDERSTORM CHANCES LOW AND HEAT HIGH. THE RIDGE
IS FORECAST TO WEAKEN BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...PERHAPS GIVING US A
LITTLE BETTER CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS.

MINOR CHANGES. WEAK H5 LOW CENTERED OVER WEST-CENTRAL MS IS
FORECAST TO MOVE EAST-NORTHEAST DURING THE DAY. THIS LOW IN
COMBINATION WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY ACROSS THE

ISSUED 208 AM CDT MON JUN 6 2005

THE COMPLEX OF STORMS THAT DEVELOPED SUNDAY EVENING OVER
SOUTH/CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI DECREASED RAPIDLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. MUCH OF
THE CLOUD COVER OVER THE MID SOUTH IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHOWERS
THAT FORMED OVER MISSISSIPPI. ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPED
OVER LOUISIANA AND WILL LIKELY TRACK TO THE EAST/NORTHEAST OVER THE
NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE POPPED UP OVER
PHILLIPS AND COAHOMA COUNTIES. KNQA 88-D PICKS UP ON THE OUTFLOW
BOUNDARY SENT OUT FROM THE CONVECTION EARLIER. THIS IS SERVING AS
THE FOCUS MECHANISM FOR THESE SHOWERS.

FARTHER WEST OVER THE RED RIVER VALLEY A MCS WAS TRANSLATING SLOWLY
EASTWARD. NEEDLESS TO SAY THE ATMOSPHERE OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. IS
CHAOTIC AND THE MODELS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO DECIPHER.

BOTH THE GFS AND NAM SHOW A WEAKNESS IN THE MID LEVELS THROUGH
THURSDAY. FEEL THAT RAIN CHANCES TODAY MAY BE BETTER THAN PREVIOUS
DAYS DUE TO A SLIGHT INCREASE IN STEEPENING LAPSE RATES MAINLY OVER
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. THE INSTABILITY OVER NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI IS
ALSO A CONCERN AS FAR AS DEVELOPING SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE HOW THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MENTIONED ABOVE
WILL PLAY A PART IN ADDITIONAL SHOWER DEVELOPMENT TODAY. IT APPEARS
THAT WHATEVER DEVELOPS WILL NOT REACH SEVERE LIMITS. MOST AREAS SURE
COULD USE THE RAIN.

AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES ARE CONCERNED...TODAY THE NAM IS MUCH COOLER
THAN THE MAV. THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND
CONVECTION THAT IS INFLUENCING THE LOWER TEMPS. THIS MAY COME TO
FRUITION HOWEVER WE ARE LEANING TOWARD THE WARMER MAV TEMPS JUST
BASED ON CONSISTENCY.

WITH SUCH LOW CONFIDENCE IN THE LATEST MODEL RUNS...CANNOT ARGUE
AGAINST CURRENT FORECAST ESPECIALLY IN DAYS 2 THROUGH 7.

THAT WHATEVER DEVELOPS WILL NOT REACH SEVERE LIMITS. MOST AREAS SURE 
COULD USE THE RAIN.

AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES ARE CONCERNED...TODAY THE NAM IS MUCH COOLER 
THAN THE MAV. THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO THE INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND 
CONVECTION THAT IS INFLUENCING THE LOWER TEMPS. THIS MAY COME TO 
FRUITION HOWEVER WE ARE LEANING TOWARD THE WARMER MAV TEMPS JUST 
BASED ON CONSISTENCY.

WITH SUCH LOW CONFIDENCE IN THE LATEST MODEL RUNS...CANNOT ARGUE 
AGAINST CURRENT FORECAST ESPECIALLY IN DAYS 2 THROUGH 7.

AFTERNOON AND TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOW TO MID 90S. THERE WERE
SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS THAT POPPED UP IN THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST CORNER
OF THE FORECAST AREA BUT THEY MOVED INTO ALABAMA. MODELS BRING WEAK
SYSTEM THROUGH THE REGION MONDAY. THIS MAY TRIGGERS SOME SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS SO WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN FOR MONDAY. BY MONDAY
NIGHT CHANCE FOR RAIN DIMINISHES AS WE APPROACH 00Z SO WILL GO BACK
TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM MAY MOVE THROUGH ON
TUESDAY SO HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS IN DURING THE DAY. FROM TUESDAY
NIGHT ON...IT APPEARS THAT ANY RAIN THAT WE MIGHT GET WILL BE MAINLY
LATE AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING. TEMPERATURES ARE DIFFICULT TO GET A
HANDLE ON. IF WE DONT SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF CLOUDS MONDAY...WE
MIGHT BE AS HOT AS TODAY BUT WITH THE ANTICIPATION OF MORE CLOUDS
HAVE GONE LOWER THAN TODAY. REMAINDER OF WEEK IS NO EASIER WITH MUCH

SKIES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING WERE CLEAR AND WINDS WERE 
SOUTH GENERALLY LESS THAN 5 MPH. A BROKEN LINE OF CONVECTION 
STRETCHED FROM WISCONSIN THROUGH WESTERN ILLINOIS AND THEN FROM 
SOUTHWESTERN MISSOURI INTO NORTHEAST TEXAS. THIS AREA OF RAIN WAS 
MOVING EAST AND SHOWING WEAKENING TRENDS. HIGH...THIN DEBRIS CLOUDS  
WERE EDGING CLOSER TO THE FORECAST AREA.

HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF THE FORECAST FOR THIS 
PACKAGE. A VERY CHALLENGING FORECAST FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS 
FAR AS RAIN CHANCES GOES. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE VALUES ARE SUFFICIENT 
FOR THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP AND BECOME SEVERE. HOWEVER...TRIGGER 
MECHANISM SEEMS TO BE LACKING. THE ONE THING OF CONCERN MAY BE A 
MESOSCALE BOUNDARY FROM ANY CONVECTION THAT DOES DEVELOP TODAY NEAR 
THE FORECAST AREA AS WELL AS ANY BOUNDARIES FORMED BY THE CONVECTION 
OUT WEST. THEREFORE...WILL FORECAST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN WEST OF 
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND NO MENTION OF RAIN ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF 
THE AREA FOR TODAY. RAIN CHANCES TONIGHT ONLY RISE SLIGHTLY WITH 
MENTION OF RAIN EVERYWHERE EXCEPT PARTS OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. 
THE BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN STILL APPEAR TO BE MONDAY. 

TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE VERY WARM AGAIN WITH MAX TEMPS IN MEMPHIS 
REACHING 95. FAR FROM THE RECORD OF 99. TEMPS MAY BE HINDERED BY 
DEBRIS CLOUDS DEPENDING ON HOW THINGS EVOLVE THROUGH THE DAY BUT 
HAVE TRIED TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. OVERNIGHT LOWS SUNDAY NIGHT WILL BE 
MILD ONCE AGAIN MAINLY WITH UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S. SLIGHTLY COOLER 
MONDAY WITH EXPECTED RAIN AND CLOUD COVER BUT STILL ABOVE NORMAL 
WITH TEMPS IN THE UPPER 80S. 

NO OTHER CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST. 
WITH ALL THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND WEAK FLOW ALOFT OVER THE MID 
SOUTH...THE MENTION OF DIURNAL THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE WEEK SEEMS 
REASONABLE.

LATEST SURFACE MAP OVER THE MID SOUTH INDICATES TEMPERATURES RANGING 
FROM THE 60S TO 70S. THIN CIRRUS CLOUDS WERE DRIFTING ACROSS 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT FEATURE IS THE CURRENT DEW 
POINTS...WHICH ARE MUCH LOWER THAN PREVIOUS AND CURRENT MODEL RUNS.

THE UPPER PATTERN OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL SHIFT TO A SOUTHWEST 
FLOW. THE CURRENT SHORTWAVE OVER KANSAS WAS PRODUCING STRONG 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER EASTERN KANSAS AND NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI. THIS 
WAVE WILL WEAKEN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS AND SWING INTO 
MINNESOTA THIS AFTERNOON. THE MAIN TROUGH OVER COLORADO WAS AIDING 
CONVECTION OVER SOUTHERN KANSAS. THIS MAIN WAVE WILL TRANSLATE INTO 
THE GREAT LAKES REGION BY SUNDAY MORNING PASSING WELL NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA.

DIFFICULTY COMES IN GETTING A HANDLE ON WEAK WAVES IN THE SOUTHWEST 
FLOW MOVING OVER DATA SPARSE REGIONS. THE SURFACE LOW TO THE NORTH 
AND HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE COAST OF FLORIDA WILL HELP INCREASE 
MOISTURE ADVECTION INTO THE MID SOUTH THROUGH THE WEEKEND. AN 
ISOLATED SHOWER WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON HOWEVER CHANCES 
ARE SO SLIM THAT IT WILL NOT BE MENTIONED IN THE ZONES AT THIS TIME. 

A BETTER CHANCE OF FOR RAIN WILL BEGIN SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND CONTINUE 
THROUGH MONDAY AS THE UPPER FLOW INCREASES AND BETTER DYNAMICS 
OCCURS. 

SUMMERTIME CONVECTION POSSIBLE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK 
WITH THE PRESENCE OF HIGH MOISTURE LEVELS AND WEAK INSTABILITY.

UPPER LOW NOW LOCATED OVER MIDDLE TN AND KY AND CONTINUES TO MOVE 
EAST. BACK EDGE OF THE CLOUD DECK HAS MOVED OUT OF THE CWA WITH 
RADIATION FOG DEVELOPING ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. DENSE FOG ADVISORY 
REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR EASTERN AREAS UNTIL 9 AM WHERE VISIBILITIES OF 
ONE QUARTER MILE CAN BE EXPECTED. VISIBILITIES WILL IMPROVE BY MID 
MORNING.

AS THE UPPER LOW CONTINUES EAST...UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE 
MIDSOUTH TODAY. TEMPS WILL WARM BACK TO NORMAL LEVELS AND DEWPOINTS 
WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE...MAKING FOR A WARM AND MUGGY DAY. 
SUBSIDENCE WITH THE RIDGE WILL PREVENT CONVECTION TODAY. PATCHY FOG 
MAY AGAIN BE A PROBLEM TONIGHT. GFS SHOWS INCREASING HIGH MOISTURE 
ENTERING THE AREA TONIGHT WHICH MAY HELP CUT DOWN ON THE FOG...BUT 
FEEL WITH THE ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...LIGHT WINDS...AND AT 
LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES...PATCHY FOG IS WORTH MENTIONING IN THE 
ZONES AGAIN. INCLUDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN EXTREME NE ARKANSAS AS 
OVERNIGHT MCS MAY CLIP THOSE AREAS...BUT OVERALL CWA SHOULD REMAIN 
DRY.

UPPER FLOW TRANSITIONS TO SOUTHWESTERLY FOR THE WEEKEND AS THE RIDGE 
SLIDES EAST. MODELS AGREE THAT BEST LIFTING WILL STAY WELL TO OUR 
NORTHWEST. THERE WILL BE PLENTY OF SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY WITH 
CAPES GREATER THAN 2500 J/KG AND LITTLE TO NO CAPPING INVERSION SO 
DIURNAL CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE. HOWEVER...WITH NO FOCUSING 
MECHANISMS EVIDENT...CANNOT GO ANY HIGHER THAN LOW CHANCE POPS. 
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF A SUBTLE SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE SW 
FLOW THAT WOULD PROVIDE A BETTER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION...BUT IT IS 
VIRTUALLY IMPOSSIBLE TO PREDICT SUCH THINGS THIS FAR OUT. 850 TEMPS 
APPROACHING 18C WILL SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO NEAR 90. 

PATTERN TURNS MORE ZONAL BY LATE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. CHANCES FOR 
AFTERNOON CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THIS TIME. TEMPS WILL 
REMAIN WARM AND IT WILL STILL FEEL RATHER MUGGY OUT WITH UPPER 60S 
TO NEAR 70 DEWPOINTS PRESENT. GLOBAL MODELS INDICATES THAT THE SE

THE MONTH OF MAY HAS GONE OUT AS THE DRIEST EVER IN JACKSON AND 
JONESBORO...THE SECOND DRIEST IN TUPELO...AND THE FIFTH DRIEST IN 
MEMPHIS. THE QUESTION IN THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS IS THERE ANY 
RELIEF IN SIGHT?

TAKING A LOOK AT THE CURRENT SITUATION...500MB LOW BEGINNING TO 
CLOSE OFF OVER W CNTRL AL WITH A WEAK SFC LOW LOCATED VERY CLOSE TO 
THE UPPER LOW. A LARGE SHIELD OF PRECIP NOTED OVER MOST OF N AL 
WHICH CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHWEST INTO NE MS. PRECIP HAVING A HARD 
TIME GETTING EAST OF A ALCORN MS TO CALHOUN CITY MS LINE.

MODELS HAVE STARTED TO COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT IN THE EVOLUTION 
OF THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN...BUT DIFFERENCES DO REMAIN. UPPER LOW OVER 
W CNTRL AL WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTH TOWARD THE CWA TODAY...WHILE 
SHORTWAVE OVER NE TX WILL MOVE EAST AND CONSOLIDATE WITH THE LOW 
OVER THE MIDSOUTH. BEST POPS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE IN THE SOUTHEAST 
CWA. CATEGORICAL POPS ARE WARRANTED OVER THAT AREA...WITH POPS 
DIMINISHING TO CHANCE CATEGORY IN THE WEST. DID NOT BUY OFF ON THE 
MET GUIDANCE HIGH POPS FURTHER WEST AS HISTORY OF THE SYSTEM 
DICTATES THAT PRECIP HAS HAD A DIFFICULT TIME MOVING WEST. DO FEEL 
THAT MORE AREAS WILL SEE RAIN TODAY DUE TO THE UPPER LOW OVER THE 
REGION BUT SHOULD BE MORE SCATTERED OUTSIDE THE MAIN PRECIP SHIELD. 
WILL CONTINUE TO ONLY MENTION ISOLATED THUNDER AS LAPSE RATES AND 
INSTABILITY PARAMETERS REMAIN MEAGER. MOST PLACES WILL NOT REACH 80 
TODAY DUE TO ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER.

RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY AS UPPER LOW WILL BE SLOW 
TO DEPART. THINGS SHOULD FINALLY START TO CALM DOWN BY THURSDAY 
NIGHT AS THE LOW DEPARTS. ONCE AGAIN BEST POPS IN THE EAST. 

UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN FOR FRIDAY. WAA WILL BE ON THE INCREASE 
HELPING TEMPS TO CLIMB BACK TO NEAR CLIMO LEVELS. ALTHOUGH SOME 
SUBSIDENCE WILL BE PRESENT WITH THE RIDGE...AIRMASS BECOMES UNSTABLE 
WITH CAPES GREATER THAN 2000 J/KG. FELT IT PRUDENT TO INCLUDE A 20 
POP AS A FEW AIRMASS STORMS MAY BE ABLE TO FIRE UP.

SW FLOW ALOFT INCREASES OVER THE WEEKEND WITH WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS 
IN PLACE. CHANCE POPS EACH DAY THROUGH TUESDAY FOR MAINLY DIURNAL 
CONVECTION. GFS IS ADVERTISING A RATHER POTENT SHORTWAVE TO MOVE 
THROUGH ON SATURDAY. WILL NOT GO WITH THIS SOLUTION FOR NOW SINCE 
IT IS A NEW FEATURE IN THE MODEL AND THE OTHER GLOBALS DO NOT

UPPER AND SURFACE LOW APPEARS TO BE MOVING NORTHWARD OUT OF THE GULF
OF MEXICO NEAR BILOXI. PRECIPITATION OVER NE MISSISSIPPI APPEARS TO
BE DIMINISHING...AT LEAST TEMPORARILY. UPPER LOW FORECAST TO MOVE TO
NEAR THE TUPELO AREA BY MID-DAY ON WEDNESDAY. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
TO SEE PRECIPITATION REDEVELOP LATER TONIGHT ACROSS MISSISSIPPI...
SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT. THEREFORE...NO CHANGES TO GOING POPS. WITH
SIMILAR CONDITIONS TO LAST NIGHT...EXPECT LOWS TO BE AROUND THE SAME

SFC LOW LOCATED ALONG NEAR NEW ORLEANS THIS AFTN WITH UPPER TROF 
ACRS THE LOWER MS VALLEY. LIGHT RAIN CONTINUES TO PUSH INTO NE MS 
BEFORE DISSIPATING SOUTH OF THE TN BORDER. WL CONT WITH HIGHEST POPS 
ACRS NE MS THIS EVENING TAPERING TO THE NORTH. WL GO WITH A DRY 
EVENING FROM THE TN BORDER NORTHWARD. 

LATER TONIGHT...MODELS ARE FINALLY APPROACHING A CONSENSUS WITH THIS 
SYSTEM AND THE NAM SEEMS TO HAVE BEEN ON THE RIGHT TRACK...AT LEAST 
WITH SYNOPTIC FEATURES. BY 12Z WED 500 MB UPPER TROF WL ROTATE NE 
TOWARD N MS. SFC LOW WL MOVE EAST INTO SRN MS. THE MAIN MOISTURE/ 
LIFT AXIS WL ROTATE FURTHER NORTHWARD TOWARD MORNING SO WL INCREASE 
POPS A LITTLE TONIGHT AND PUSH THEM FURTHER NORTH. WL DEEMPHASIZE 
THUNDER WITH INSTABILITY PARAMETERS MARGINAL.

WED...UPPER LOW BEGINS TO CLOSE OFF OVER THE MID SOUTH WITH SFC LOW 
ALONG THE CNTRL MS/AL BORDER. DEEPEST MOISTURE ACRS ERN SXNS SO WL 
TAPER POPS FM LIKELY ACRS NE MS TO LOW CHC ACRS NE AR. EXPECT TEMPS 
TO BE FAIRLY COOL UNDER THE UPPER LOW WITH PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER AND 
WL SUBTRACT 3-4 DEGREES FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST WITH COOLER READINGS 
ACRS ERN SXNS. INSTABILITY PARAMETERS VERY MARGINAL SO HAVE PLAYED 
THUNDER POTENTIAL DOWN. 

WED NIGHT THROUGH THU NIGHT...UPPER LOW PARKED SOMEWHERE INVOF OF 
MEM AT 12Z THU. CONT TREND OF HIGHER POPS ACRS ERN SXNS WED NIGHT. 
BY LATE THU UPPER LOW WL SLOWLY BEGIN TO MOVE OUT...ACCORDING TO THE 
SLIGHTLY MORE PROGRESSIVE NAM...AND WL BEGIN TO DECREASE POPS FROM W 
TO E. THU SHOULD BE ANOTHER BELOW NORMAL DAY WITH RESPECT TO TEMPS. 

FRI AND FRI NIGHT...WEAK UPPER RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE REGION. 
EXPECT CWFA TO BE IN AN AREA OF SUBSIDENCE ON FRI WITH GOOD LOW 
LEVEL WAA. TEMPS SHOULD WARM UP NICELY BY FRI AFTN WITH READINGS 
WELL INTO THE 80S. 

SAT AND SUN...UPPER RIDGE ACRS THE SRN U.S. WITH WARM AND MUGGY 
CONDS. DECENT AFTN/EVENING INSTABILITY WL RESULT IN ISOLATED 
AFTN/EVENING TSTMS. 

MON AND TUE...UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN SOME AS AN UPPER TROF MOVES 
ACRS THE AREA. THIS WL RESULT IN A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS/TSTMS.

INCHES FOR THE MONTH A MAY. THE RECORD DRIEST WAS 0.85 INCHES IN 
1941. 

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 328 AM...

THIS FORECAST PACKAGE CONSISTS OF MANY MODEL INCONSISTENCIES IN THE 
SHORT TERM WHICH IN TURN MAKES FOR HIGHER THAN NORMAL UNCERTAINTY IN 
THE FORECAST.

CURRENTLY...A WEAK SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH CONTINUES TO SLOWLY MOVES 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN STATES. AT THE SURFACE...A STATIONARY FRONT 
REMAINS ALONG THE SHORE OF THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. REGIONAL 
RADAR SHOWS AN INCREASE IN SHOWER DEVELOPMENT OVER CENTRAL 
MISSISSIPPI...MOVING NORTH TOWARD THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA. 

THE ETA AND GFS CONTINUE TO HANDLE THE ABOVE FEATURES 
DIFFERENTLY...PLAYING HAVOC ON THE FORECAST. THE 00Z ETA APPEARS 
BETTER INITIALIZED THAN THE GFS. ALSO...THE GFS SUFFERS FROM 
CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK THROUGH 60HR. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE ETA IN THE 
SHORT TERM AS IT APPEARS TO HANDLE THE MOVEMENT OF THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY MORE REASONABLY. EXPECT THE BOUNDARY TO REMAIN WELL SOUTH 
OF THE CWA...WITH WEAK LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT. AS 
HAS BEEN THE CASE THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS...WILL HAVE A TIGHT POP 
GRADIENT WITH LIKELY POPS IN THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF COUNTIES FOR

NORTH OF THERE. TEMP GRADIENT WILL LIKELY REFLECT THAT OF YESTERDAY 
WITH HIGHER TEMPS ACROSS THE NORTHWEST CWA AND LOWER TEMPS ACROSS 
THE SOUTHEAST WHERE THE BETTER CLOUD COVER WILL BE. WENT A FEW 
DEGREES ABOVE GUIDANCE FROM MEMPHIS AND JACKSON. CHANCE POPS WILL 
CONTINUE OVER THE SOUTHEAST TONIGHT. MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES OF LESS 
THAN 6 C/KM AND POSITIVE LIFTED INDICES SUGGEST ANY THUNDER WILL BE 
ISOLATED.

EVEN THOUGH THE MODELS HAVE DIFFERENCES IN OPINION...A WEAK TROUGH 
WILL CONTINUE OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THURSDAY AS A WEAK 
SURFACE LOW TRAVERSES ENE ACROSS CENTRAL ALABAMA. WILL MAINTAIN 
CHANCE POPS EAST TO SLIGHT CHANCE WEST. ABUNDANT 850 MOISTURE ON 
WEDNESDAY WILL ALLOW FOR PLENTIFUL CLOUDS WHICH WILL KEEP TEMPS A 
FEW DEGREES COOLER. 

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING FINALLY BEGINS TO BUILD IN ON  
FRIDAY...PERSISTING INTO THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY 
WARM TO NEAR CLIMO LEVELS IN RESPONSE TO WARMER 850 TEMPS ADVECTING 
INTO THE AREA. ALSO...SINCE THE RIDGE IS RATHER BROAD AND THE CWA

GOING ON ACRS THE REGION WITH PRECIP WELL TO THE SOUTH AND WEST OF 
THE REGION WITH SOME SUN ACRS NRN SXNS. FRONT WL REMAIN SOUTH OF THE 
REGION TONIGHT AS UPPER TROF STARTS TO MOVE OUT OF THE WRN GULF INTO 
LA BY 12Z TUE. GFS TRIES TO DEVELOP SFC LOW OVER SRN MS AND MOVES IT 
TO N CNTRL MS BY 12Z BUT THIS SEEMS UNREALISTIC...ALONG WITH ITS QPF 
FIELDS. THE NAM SOLUTION OF WEAKER LOW FURTHER SOUTH SEEMS MORE 
REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT. AS A RESULT WL LOWER POPS TONIGHT AND GO 
WITH A DRY FORECAST NORTH OF MEMPHIS WITH CHC POPS ACRS N MS. SHOULD 
SEE SOME STARS ACRS THE NRN HALF AS WELL. CUT A COUPLE DEGREES OFF 
TEMPS ACRS THE NORTH DUE TO LOWER DEWPOINTS AND PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. 

TUESDAY...STNRY FRONT WL CONT TO REMAIN ACRS THE LOWER MS VALLEY 
WHILE THE UPPER TROF MOVES INTO MS BY 00Z WED. BEST LIFT AND 
MOISTURE WL BE ALONG AND NEAR THE FRONT SO WL TAPER POPS FROM SOUTH 
TO NORTH. EXPECT WARMEST TEMPS ALONG KY/MO BORDERS WHERE SOME SUN IS 
POSSIBLE. 

TUESDAY NIGHT...DIVERGENCE IN THE MODELS BEYOND THIS POINT. HOWEVER 
18Z NAM AND 12Z GFS IN BETTER AGREEMENT. LOOKS LIKE NAM IS STARTING 
TO COME AROUND TO SLIGHTLY FAVORED GFS SOLUTION THOUGH IT STILL HAS 
MORE TROFINESS TO THE WEST ACRS THE ARKLATEX. FRONT STILL TO THE

AGAIN HIGHEST POPS ACRS SRN AREAS. 

WED AND WED NIGHT...UPPER TROF REMAINS ACRS THE AREA AND CANNOT RULE 
OUT SOME TSTM/SHRA ACTIVITY. BEST GUESS...MORE NUMEROUS IN EASTERN 
SXNS. EXPECT TEMPS TO BE A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS.

THU AND FRI...UPPER TROF SLOWLY LIFTING OUT OF THE AREA WITH UPPER

SHOWING THE BULK OF PRECIP WILL STAY SOUTH OF A MEMPHIS TO SAVANNAH 
LINE. CAN/T RULE OUT A FEW ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS NORTH OF 
THIS LINE SO WILL HAVE A RANGE OF 20/30 POPS IN NORTHWESTERN ZONES

THE MIDSOUTH LIES IN AN AREA OF CONFLUENCE BETWEEN THE NORTHERN
STREAM AND AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM THIS MORNING. THIS WILL MAKE
FOR A DIFFICULT FORECAST THE NEXT FEW DAYS. SEVERAL
COMPLEXES OF THUNDERSTORMS ARE RUMBLING FROM EAST TX TO CENTRAL MS
THIS MORNING. A WARM FRONT LIES FROM SOUTHERN AR TO SOUTHERN AL.
SHOWERS ARE SPREADING INTO NORTH MS AHEAD OF THIS FRONT BUT ARE
ENCOUNTERING DRY AIR AS THEY SPREAD NORTHWARD.

THE GFS SEEMS TO BE HANDLING THE CURRENT SITUATION BETTER THAN
THE NAM...SO WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW IT IN THE UPCOMING FORECAST.
THIS LEADS TO A TIGHT NORTH TO SOUTH GRADIENT IN THE POPS THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH THE HIGHEST POPS FROM
EAST-CENTRAL AR INTO NORTH MS AND THE LOWEST POPS FROM NORTHEAST AR
INTO NORTHWEST TN. FOR TODAY...THE WARM FRONT WILL PUSH SLOWLY
NORTHWARD INTO NORTH MS AS AN ELONGATED UPPER TROUGH MOVING INTO THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS ALLOWS THE UPPER FLOW TO BECOME MORE SOUTHWESTERLY
ACROSS NORTH MS. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL GRADUALLY SPREAD
NORTHWARD TODAY AHEAD OF THE WARM FRONT. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT
IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE NORTHERN STREAM WILL HELP TO SUPPRESS MUCH OF
THE RAIN SOUTH OF A JONESBORO TO JACKSON LINE...ALTHOUGH WILL
CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FROM NORTHEAST AR INTO NORTHWEST TN.

FOR TONIGHT AND MONDAY...FRONTAL SYSTEM BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY
WEST TO EAST FROM EAST-CENTRAL AR INTO NORTH MS. MEANWHILE...
UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL MOVE ACROSS NORTH MS. WILL CONTINUE
WITH LOWEST POPS NORTH TO HIGHEST POPS SOUTH.

FOR MONDAY NIGHT...THE GFS INDICATES A SURFACE LOW MOVING ALONG THE
FRONT ACROSS NORTH MS. CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD SHOWING LOWEST
POPS NORTHEAST AR TO HIGHEST POPS NORTHEAST MS.

COULD BE SOME HEAVY RAINFALL TOTALS FROM EAST-CENTRAL AR INTO NORTH
MS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. HOWEVER...WILL NOT MENTION IN
THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME SINCE THUNDERSTORM COMPLEXES WITH THE
HEAVIER RAIN ARE MOSTLY MOVING TO THE SOUTH OF THIS AREA AT THIS
TIME. IN ADDITION...WE HAVE BEEN RATHER DRY AT LEAST THE LAST COUPLE
OF WEEKS.

WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO CURRENT FORECAST TUESDAY AND BEYOND.

WHEN WILL THE RAIN START AND WHEN WILL THE RAIN WILL END. IF THE GFS 
IS RIGHT...THE MIDSOUTH MAY BE IN FOR A WET WEEK WHILE THE NAM IS A 
LITTLE MORE OPTIMISTIC. A STATIONARY FRONT LOCATED ACROSS NORTHERN 
LOUISIANA AND SOUTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI WILL BEGIN TO LIFT NORTHWARD 
AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT. THE GFS BEGINS TO SPREAD RAIN INTO SOUTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE CWA AROUND MIDNIGHT WHILE THE NAM DOESN/T START THE 
PRECIP UNTIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON. WITH THESE DIFFERENCES WILL TRY TO GO 
IN BETWEEN. WILL ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POP ACROSS SOUTHERN 
ZONES FOR LATE TONIGHT.

THE NEXT DIFFERENCE IS HOW FAR NORTH WILL THE WARM FRONT WILL GO. THE 
NAM BRINGS THE FRONT THROUGH THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH WHILE THE GFS HANGS 
IT UP ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI. THIS DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MODELS 
PRESENT PROBLEMS WITH TEMPERATURES...POPS...CLOUDS...ETC THROUGH 
MUCH OF THE WEEK. THE GFS KEEPS THE FRONT HUNG UP ACROSS THE MIDDLE 
PART OF THE CWA. SEVERAL LOW PRESSURE CENTERS DEVELOP AND MOVE ALONG 
THE FRONT THROUGH THE MIDDLE PART OF THE WEEK. THIS KEEPS THE 
MIDSOUTH WET WITH EVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL. 
TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO BE ON THE COOL SIDE. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE 
NAM PUSHES THE WARM FRONT NORTH OF THE CWA SUNDAY NIGHT AND BRINGS 
THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT THROUGH THE CWA MONDAY INTO MONDAY 
EVENING. BEHIND THE FRONT...HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE AREA 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE PART OF THE WEEK. WILL TRY TO GO WITH A 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE MODELS AND KEEP POPS IN THROUGH TUESDAY AND 
THEN GO DRY THROUGH THURSDAY. 

MODEL SHOWS ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE AREA TOWARD THE END OF 
THE FORECAST PERIOD. WILL INTRODUCE SMALL POPS IN FORECAST.

BAND OF MID LEVEL CLOUDS STRETCHES ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH THIS MORNING
AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING SHORT WAVE IN WEST-NORTHWESTERLY FLOW
ALOFT. ONLY A FEW SPOTS OF RAIN ARE PRESENTLY BEING OBSERVED ACROSS
NORTH MS. WILL GO WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR TODAY. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
SHOWS DRY AIR ALOFT WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE MIDSOUTH AND EXPECT THAT
TO CONTINUE TODAY. THINK CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY CLEAR FROM THE
NORTHWEST WITH MOST OF THE AREA MOSTLY SUNNY BY THIS AFTERNOON. ANY
REMAINING RAIN WILL SOON BE OUT OF NORTH MS. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL
SPREAD INTO THE MIDSOUTH WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES FORECAST TO BE
ABOUT THE SAME AS YESTERDAY.

FOR TONIGHT...LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL GRADUALLY TURN TO THE SOUTH.
A WARM FRONT WILL LIFT TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE SOUTH. HOWEVER...
THINK THAT RAIN WILL REMAIN TO OUR WEST AND SOUTH.

WE FINALLY GET INTO A WET PATTERN SUNDAY INTO MEMORIAL DAY...AND
POSSIBLY LONGER. THE WARM FRONT WILL LIFT INTO THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY
WITH THE ATMOSPHERE DESTABILIZING. CAPES CLIMB TO BETWEEN 1500 AND
2500 J/KG. MEANWHILE...A SHORT WAVE WILL APPROACH FROM THE WEST.
WILL INCREASE POPS TO 50 PERCENT...LATER FORECASTS MAY NEED TO GO
EVEN HIGHER FOR PART OF THE AREA. THE GFS INDICATES A STRONG VORT
MAX APPROACHING FROM THE WEST EARLY SUNDAY. THIS SEEMS OVERDONE AND
PROBABLY CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK...BUT WILL NOT TOTALLY DISCOUNT
REMNANTS OF AN MCS APPROACHING THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST SUNDAY.
SPC HAS PART OF THE MIDSOUTH IN A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE FOR SUNDAY.
ATTM...IT SEEMS THE THREAT WOULD BE ISOLATED WITH POSSIBLY SOME
LARGE HAIL AND HIGH WINDS.

FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MEMORIAL DAY...WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR MOST OF THE AREA. A COLD FRONT AND
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL MOVE NEAR THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTHWEST.
MEANWHILE...MODELS DIFFER ON HOW FAR THE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH.
THE NAM PUSHES THE FRONT NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH...WHILE THE GFS KEEPS
IT WEST TO EAST THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH. WITH A MOSTLY WEST TO EAST
UPPER LEVEL FLOW AND THE DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS HELPING TO
SUPPRESS THE WARM FRONT SOUTH...TEND TO FAVOR THE GFS PLACEMENT OF
THE WARM FRONT. REGARDLESS...EITHER WAY STILL MEANS HIGH POPS FOR THE
MIDSOUTH.

WILL INCREASE THE POPS MONDAY NIGHT...AND EXTEND THEM INTO TUESDAY.
MODELS NOW INDICATE A SLOWER MOVEMENT OF THE COLD FRONT. IF THE GFS
IS CORRECT AND LATER MODEL RUNS CONTINUE THE TREND...POPS WILL NEED
TO BE EXTENDED INTO TUESDAY NIGHT FOR PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH. MODELS
ARE REALLY HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME HANDLING THIS WEATHER SITUATION.

DRY WEATHER WILL COME TO AN END ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. SKIES 
WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS EVENING AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE 
WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA. THE DISTURBANCE WILL ALSO BRING A CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE MIDSOUTH. THE CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL 
LINGER IN THE SOUTHEASTERN HALF OF THE CWA SATURDAY MORNING. THE 
DISTURBANCE WILL EXIT THE MIDSOUTH BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON ALLOWING 
FOR HIGH PRESSURE TO REBUILD INTO THE REGION.

HOWEVER...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS WARM FRONT WILL BEGIN 
LIFTING NORTHWARD BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THIS WILL BRING BETTER 
CHANCES FOR RAIN SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY ACROSS THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH. 
LOW PRESSURE WITH AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE CWA 
MONDAY INTO MONDAY EVENING. WILL BUMP POPS TO LIKELY ACROSS ENTIRE 
CWA FOR MONDAY.

BY TUESDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL REBUILD INTO THE AREA RETURNING DRY 
WEATHER TO THE AREA. THE QUIET WEATHER WILL STICK AROUND UNTIL 
FRIDAY WHEN ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO APPROACH THE

.DISCUSSION...
IT IS ANOTHER TRANQUIL NIGHT WEATHERWISE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. THE
WEAK COLD FRONT THAT MOVED INTO THE MIDSOUTH YESTERDAY HAS ALL BUT
DISSIPATED. THERE DOES REMAIN A WEAK DEWPOINT GRADIENT ACROSS THE
NORTHWEST PART OF THE MIDSOUTH. SOME MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ARE
OBSERVED ON SATELLITE. THESE CLOUDS ARE THINNING OUT AS ANY
REMAINING UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT PULLS TO THE EAST.

00Z NAM AND GFS ARE IN SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT THIS MORNING FOR THE
SHORT TERM. TODAYS WEATHER WILL BE MUCH LIKE YESTERDAYS. A DRY WEST
TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. SKIES WILL BE
MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY WITH MOST CLOUDS BEING SUPPRESSED
ACROSS NORTH MS THIS MORNING. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN STABLE AND
CAPPED...THUS WE CAN EXPECT ANOTHER DRY DAY.

FOR TONIGHT...DO NOT LIKE THE SPURIOUS VORT MAX THE GFS MOVES
TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG LIFT.
INSTEAD PREFER THE NAM SOLUTION. THE NAM BRINGS A WEAK
TROUGH...SURFACE AND ALOFT...THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTHWEST.
WILL MENTION 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS / THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH. THE EXCEPTION IS THE SOUTHERN REACHES OF NORTH
MS INCLUDING TUPELO WHERE WILL MENTION 30 PERCENT POPS. THE
INSTABILITY / MOISTURE IS FORECAST TO BE A LITTLE BETTER IN THIS
AREA. HOWEVER...NOT REALLY THAT IMPRESSED WITH THE CHANCES FOR RAIN
ANYWHERE TONIGHT SINCE THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMES QUICKLY CAPPED AFTER
SUNSET AND THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS ARE WEAK.

FOR SATURDAY...WILL REMOVE THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. THE NAM
SHOWS THE WEAK TROUGH MOVING SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE MIDSOUTH EARLY IN
THE MORNING. DRY AIR ALOFT WILL SPREAD INTO THE MIDSOUTH BEHIND
THIS SYSTEM.

SATURDAY NIGHT...LOW LEVEL WINDS TURN TO THE SOUTH ALLOWING FOR
SOME INCREASE IN MOISTURE...BUT PRECIPITATION IS FORECAST TO REMAIN
TO OUR NORTH AND WEST.

SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...RAIN CHANCES INCREASE AND HOPEFULLY WE
CAN GET SOME NEEDED RAINFALL. THE ATMOSPHERE BECOME UNSTABLE SUNDAY
WITH CAPES CLIMBING TO BETWEEN 1500 AND 3000 J/KG AS SHOWN BY THE
NAM. MEANWHILE...UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL APPROACH THE AREA
IN WEST-N0RTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.

IN THE LONGER RANGE...THE GFS IS BRINGING A MODERATE COLD FRONT
THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT. LATER FORECASTS MAY BE ABLE TO
REMOVE POPS FOR MUCH OF THE AREA TUESDAY IF THE CURRENT FORECAST
SPEED OF THE FRONT PERSIST IN LATER MODEL RUNS.

.UPDATE...

THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT HAD APPROACHED THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE 
WEST TODAY HAS WASHED OUT ACROSS THE REGION AS IT IS VERY DIFFICULT 
TO ANALYZE A BOUNDARY ON THE SURFACE CHART. SOME MID TO HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS CONTINUE TO STREAM THROUGH AS A WEAK IMPULSE MOVES OVER THE 
AREA IN THE WNW UPPER FLOW. CURRENT FORECAST OF PARTLY CLOUDY WILL 
WORK FROM THE MS/TN LINE NORTHWARD BUT WILL ADJUST SKIES TO MOSTLY 
CLEAR OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI.

DEWPOINTS RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER TONIGHT COMPARED TO LAST 
NIGHT. THEREFORE...EXPECT OVERNIGHT LOWS TO BE SEVERAL DEGREES 
WARMER...ESPECIALLY WHERE THE MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL BE. 
CURRENT FORECAST HANDLES THIS WELL AND NO CHANGES ARE NEEDED FOR 
TEMPS TONIGHT. REST OF THE FORECAST PARAMETERS ALSO LOOK GOOD.

UPDATE TO GRIDS ALREADY OUT. ZONE UPDATE OUT SHORTLY.

QUIET WEATHER WILL COME TO AN END BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND. A WEAK 
COLD FRONT IS CURRENTLY APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST AND WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE CWA TONIGHT. NAM HINTING AT A FEW SHOWERS ACCOMPANYING 
WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT...WHILE GFS IS DRY. CURRENT RADAR 
IMAGES SHOW NOT MUCH SHOWER ACTIVITY ALONG FRONT RIGHT NOW SO WILL 
MONITOR AND MAKE A LAST MINUTE DECISION BUT RIGHT NOW LEANING TOWARD 
A DRY FORECAST. 

EXPECT FRIDAY TO BE ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE A TAD BIT COOLER THAN TODAY DUE TO THE COLD 
FRONT BUT HIGHS WILL STILL GET INTO THE LOWER 80S.

MODELS BEGIN TO SHOW BIG DIFFERENCES IN THE FORECAST A BEGINNING 
FRIDAY NIGHT. THE GFS BRINGS ANOTHER COLD FRONT THROUGH THE CWA 
FRIDAY NIGHT. BEHIND THE FRONT...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA 
KEEPING THE MIDSOUTH DRY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. BY SUNDAY...THE GFS 
BRINGS THE FRONT BACK NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT. HOWEVER THE 
NAM...IS MUCH SLOWER WITH THE NEXT COLD FRONT AND DOES NOT BRING THE 
FRONT INTO THE CWA UNTIL SATURDAY. THE NAM ALSO HANGS THE FRONT UP 
ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEKEND. CURRENT FORECAST IS 
MUCH CLOSER TO THE GFS SOLUTION SO WILL LEAN TOWARD THE GFS FOR NOW. 
HOWEVER CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON WHICH SOLUTION WILL BE RIGHT. WILL PUT 
POPS IN FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.

BY SUNDAY NIGHT...MODELS IN AGREEMENT THAT A FRONT WILL BE HUNG UP 
OVER THE MIDSOUTH. LOW PRESSURE WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT AND 
WILL MOVE ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO 
MONDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES IN THE FORECAST DURING 
THIS TIME.

AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH FROM TUESDAY INTO 
TUESDAY EVENING. WILL KEEP SMALL POPS IN FORECAST.

BY WEDNESDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AND WILL 
BRING DRY CONDITIONS BACK TO THE CWA THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST 
PERIOD WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES OCCURRING BY THURSDAY.

HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING AND THIS HAS
ALLOWED FOR MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS. TEMPERATURES
CONTINUE TO BOTTOM OUT IN THE UPPER 40S EAST WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE HAS
DECOUPLED TO LOW 60S OVER THE DELTA AND THE MEMPHIS HEAT ISLAND. THIS
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SLIDE EAST TODAY AS A WEAK COLD FRONT...NOW
STRETCHED ACROSS CENTRAL MISSOURI INTO NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA...
APPROACHES THE AREA. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. AT THIS TIME NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIP
WITH THE FRONT...AS THERE IS NO RETURN FLOW AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM AND
THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS DRY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM INTO THE LOW TO
MID 80S ACROSS THE AREA...UNDER A DECENT AMOUNT OF LATE MAY
SUNSHINE...NEUTRAL LOW LEVEL TEMPERATURE ADVECTION...AND DRY
CONDITIONS. THIS GOES ABOVE GUIDANCE WHICH HAS BEEN TOO COOL AS OF
LATE DUE IN PART TO THE DRY CONDITIONS. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD
STALL OUT OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI ON FRIDAY AND WASH OUT. THIS MEANS
ANOTHER DRY DAY FRIDAY...WITH TEMPERATURES GETTING BACK INTO THE
LOWER 80S.

THE REGION SHOULD STAY UNDER NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT INTO THE WEEKEND...
AS THE BLOCKING PATTERN THAT HAS BEEN IN PLACE ACROSS THE COUNTRY
BREAKS DOWN AND ALLOWS THE UPPER LOW NOW OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA
CANADA TO SLIDE SOUTHEAST OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THE FIRST IN
A SERIES OF SHORTWAVE TROUGHS ROTATING THROUGH THE BASE OF THIS
TROUGH WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SENDING THROUGH TONIGHTS COLD FRONT.
ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL EJECT EAST OUT OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH
AND SEND ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE AREA ON FRIDAY
AFTERNOON. THINK AT THIS TIME THAT THIS FRONT WILL STALL AND
DISSIPATE NORTH OF OUR AREA. AGAIN...WITH LACK OF RETURN FLOW IN
ADVANCE OF THIS FRONT...NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIPITATION WITH THIS
FEATURE.

THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY OF INTEREST...THAT WILL PLAY A ROLE IN THIS
WEEKENDS WEATHER IS CURRENTLY STALLED ALONG THE GULF COAST INTO
CENTRAL TEXAS. MODEL GUIDANCE HAS DIFFERED QUITE A BIT WITH THE
OVERALL HANDLING OF THIS FRONTS MOVEMENT...WITH THE 00Z NAM QUICKER
THAN THE 00Z GFS WITH RETURN NORTHWARD OF THE GULF FRONT AND
ASSOCIATED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. GOT A QUICK LOOK AT THE 06Z NAM AND
IT IS A BIT SLOWER THAN THE 00Z RUN WITH RETURNING THE FRONT
NORTHWARD...AND THIS MAKES SENSE WITH NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT ONLY
SLOWLY TRANSITIONING TO A MORE ZONAL FLOW THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TO
ACCOUNT FOR THE NORTHWARD RETURN OF THE FRONT...HAVE ADDED SLIGHT
POPS CENTRAL AREAS AND CHANCE POPS SOUTH. LATER SHIFTS WILL NEED TO
EVALUATE TIMING OF THE FRONT...AS MAY NEED TO SLOW THINGS DOWN AND
DOWNPLAY SATURDAY RAIN CHANCES. BUT WITH CURRENT INCONSISTENCIES
WITH THE MODELS...FEEL THAT IT IS PRUDENT TO LEAVE AS IS FOR NOW.

FOR SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...CURRENTLY THINK THAT AN MCS MAY
DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES SATURDAY EVENING...AS LOW
LEVEL WINDS RETURN TO THE SOUTH AND LOW LEVEL JET INCREASES TO OUR
WEST. WITH FRONT ANTICIPATED TO BE IN THE VICINITY...ANY DEVELOPING
MCS SHOULD DEVELOP SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE MOISTURE AXIS IN PLACE
OVER SOME PORTIONS OF OUR AREA. THEREFORE...HAVE INCREASED POPS
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS POSSIBILITY.
CONFIDENCE ON THIS ENTIRE SCENARIO IS LOW AT THIS TIME THOUGH...DUE
TO MODEL INCONSISTENCY.

BEYOND SUNDAY...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DIVERGE FURTHER...SO FEEL THAT
WITH ZONAL FLOW SETTING UP OVER THE AREA AND A STALLED FRONT IN THE
VICINITY...A SERIES OF UPPER DISTURBANCES SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE
FLOW AND TRIGGER PERIODS OF WET WEATHER THROUGH THE EXTENDED. SKILL
AT TIMING THESE PARTICULAR SYSTEMS IS FAIRLY LOW THIS FAR OUT...SO
HAVE MADE FEW CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED AND HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS IN
PLACE THROUGH WEDNESDAY. PRECIP SPECIFICS WILL BE WORKED OUT AS WE
GET CLOSER TO THESE PERIODS. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...DUE TO EXPECTED PERIODS OF UNSETTLED
WEATHER.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION SOUTHWARD
OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING. SEASONABLY LOW DEWPOINTS HAVE
FILTERED INTO THE AREA ALONG WITH PLEASANTLY COOL TEMPERATURES.
THE SURFACE FRONT THAT MOVED ACROSS THE REGION YESTERDAY IS CURRENTLY
STRETCHED ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS
WITH CONVECTION NOTED OVER SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND NORTHEAST
LOUISIANA IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE FRONT AND A WEAKENING MESOSCALE
CONVECTIVE VORTEX. THIS SYSTEM AND THE ASSOCIATED FRONT SHOULD SINK
EVEN FURTHER SOUTH TODAY AND AWAY FROM THE MID-SOUTH.

ANOTHER MCS DEVELOPED OVER THE PLAINS STATES OVERNIGHT AND CONTINUES
TO MOVE SOUTHWARD INTO TEXAS THIS MORNING. SOME HIGH CIRRUS
CONTINUES TO STREAM SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
SOME OF THIS CIRRUS MAY STREAM ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE AREA THIS
MORNING...BUT THIS CLOUD COVER SHOULD DIMINISH LATER TODAY AS THE
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX CONTINUES TO WEAKEN. SO EXPECT MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES
OVER THE MID-SOUTH TODAY. AS FOR THIS AFTERNOONS HIGH TEMPERATURES...
THEY WILL BE INFLUENCED BY THE LOW LEVEL NORTHEASTERLY FLOW IN PLACE
OVER THE AREA. CONTINUED LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION...SHOULD KEEP
TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 5 AND 10 DEGREES COOLER THAN YESTERDAYS HIGHS.

THE UPPER LEVEL ANALYSIS THIS MORNING STILL SHOWING A PERSISTENT
BLOCKING PATTERN IN PLACE WITH AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
SPINNING OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES...A FLAT RIDGE OVER THE DESERT
SOUTHWEST...AND ANOTHER UPPER LOW SPINNING OVER CENTRAL MANITOBA
CANADA. THIS BLOCKING PATTERN IS BEGINNING TO BREAK DOWN...AND THIS
SHOULD ALLOW THE UPPER LOW OVER SOUTHERN CANADA TO DROP SOUTHEAST
OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION THROUGH FRIDAY. AS THIS OCCURS...A
NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW WILL
EJECT SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE MIDWEST. THIS WILL HELP TO SEND A WEAK
COLD FRONT SOUTHEAST ACROSS OUR AREA THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT.
WITH LACK OF RETURN FLOW FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO...EXPECT LIMITED
MOISTURE IN ADVANCE OF THIS FRONT. THIS WILL ALLOW THE FRONT TO MOVE
THROUGH DRY.

AS FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE WEAK FRONT
FROM THURSDAY NIGHT WILL STALL TO OUR SOUTH FRIDAY NIGHT AND WASH
OUT. A DEVELOPING WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH TOWARDS THE AREA BY THE
END OF THE WEEKEND. IN ADDITION...A SERIES OF UPPER LEVEL
DISTURBANCES WILL RIPPLE ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE SUNDAY THROUGH
TUESDAY TIME FRAME...AS THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES INCREASINGLY
ZONAL. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS STILL A BIT INCONSISTENT WITH HANDLING
MOVEMENT AND EVENTUAL PLACEMENT OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY...AND THIS
WILL IMPACT OVERALL RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THIS PERIOD. AT THIS TIME...
PLAN TO REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH EARLIER FORECASTS AND KEEP EXTENDED
PERIOD AS IS UNTIL OVERALL PATTERN IS CLEARER...WITH FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY REMAINING DRY...AND SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS SUNDAY
THROUGH TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN NEAR OR SLIGHTLY BELOW
NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

.UPDATE...

A WELL DEFINED MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE VORTEX AND ASSOCIATED
MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM CURRENTLY IN PROGRESS OVER WEST
CENTRAL ARKANSAS WITH ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS FURTHER SOUTH AND
WEST ALONG A STATIONARY BOUNDARY. THE MCV AND MCS SHOULD STAY JUST
TO THE WEST OF THE MEMPHIS CWA AS IT CONTINUES TO MOVE SOUTHWEST
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. IMPRESSIVE OUTFLOW 
FROM THE MCS HAS RESULTED IN A DENSE CIRRUS SHIELD OVER THE
MIDSOUTH. AS A RESULT...WILL HAVE TO UPDATE CLOUD COVER TO MOSTLY
CLOUDY IN MOST AREAS. THIS WILL ALSO HAVE AN AFFECT ON  
TEMPERATURES...THEREFORE WILL RAISE TEMPS UP ABOUT THREE DEGREES.
WOULD RAISE THEM MORE BUT WILL ALLOW SOME ROOM FOR COOLING LATER
TONIGHT AS THE DENSER CIRRUS MOVES FURTHER SOUTH.

REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK. UPDATE TO GRIDS ALREADY SENT
AND THE ZONE FORECAST UPDATE IS FORTHCOMING.

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 203 PM CDT TUE MAY 24 2005) 

DISCUSSION...
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE CWA. DEWPOINT FIELD IS BEST
INDICATION OF WHERE THE EFFECTIVE BOUNDARY IS AT. DEWPOINTS ACROSS
THE CWA ARE GENERALLY IN THE 50S...AND RUNNING A LITTLE LOWER THAN
MOST GUIDANCE. TEMPERATURES RUNNING FROM MIDDLE 70S EXTREME
NORTHEAST TO UPPER 80S SOUTH.

COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTHWEST ARKANSAS IS WEAKENING AS IT
MOVES INTO A MORE STABLE AIRMASS. ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING
OVER EXTREME SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS...BUT THOSE ARE ALREADY PAST OUR
AREA.

SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
WE REMAIN IN NORTHWEST FLOW THROUGH FRIDAY. EXPECT COMPLEX TONIGHT TO
REMAIN WEST OF OUR AREA...BUT RESERVE THE RIGHT TO MAKE A LAST MINUTE
CHANGE IF SOMETHING DEVELOPS. FORECAST QUESTION WILL BE WHETHER ANY
MCS AFFECTS OUR CWA. NAM SOLUTION KEEPS THESE TO OUR WEST...WHILE GFS
TRIES TO BRING ONE ACROSS ON FRIDAY. NAM SOLUTION HAS CONTINUITY FROM
PREVIOUS RUNS FOR FRIDAY...AND BOTH MODELS ARE NOW DRY ON THURSDAY.
HAVE REMOVED MENTION FROM DAYTIME HOURS ON THURSDAY...AND WILL KEEP
FRIDAY DRY FOR NOW.

TEMPERATURES...FOR WEDNESDAY...HIGHS WILL BE NEAR TODAYS LEVELS
ACROSS THE EXTREME NORTHEAST...AND 5-7 DEGREES COOLER ACROSS THE
SOUTHWEST HALF. SHOULD SEE A DECENT REBOUND ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...
ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS WARM AS THE SOUTHWEST HALF IS TODAY. TRENDED
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY MAX TEMPS UP A COUPLE OF DEGREES. DIDNT MAKE
MANY CHANGES TO LOWS FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT DID
RAISE MINS THURSDAY NIGHT A FEW DEGREES.

LONG TERM (AFTER FRIDAY)...
NO CONSISTENT STRONG SIGNALS FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE
EXTENDED FORECAST. MODELS HAVE DIFFERING SOLUTIONS...AND SINCE
SURROUNDING OFFICES AND GUIDANCE BOTH ARE ALREADY CARRYING
PRECIPITATION FROM SUNDAY ONWARD...WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO
THAT PORTION OF THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME. TEMPERATURES NEAR TO
SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPEARS TO BE SOUTH OF THE CWA THIS MORNING.
DEWPOINT FIELD IS PROBABLY BEST INDICATION OF WHERE THE EFFECTIVE
BOUNDARY IS AT. DEWPOINTS ACROSS THE CWA THIS MORNING ARE IN THE
50S...AND RUNNING A LITTLE LOWER THAN MOST GUIDANCE. TEMPERATURES
RUNNING FROM MIDDLE 70S TO LOWER 80S AT 15Z.

COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES OVER SOUTHEAST KANSAS...SOUTHWEST
MISSOURI AND NORTHWEST ARKANSAS. SEEMS TO BE WEAKENING SLIGHTLY...
BUT NOT AT THE PACE THAT THE COMPLEX YESTERDAY DISSIPATED. GUIDANCE
FORECASTS DROP THIS SYSTEM TO THE SOUTH...KEEPING IT WEST OF OUR
AREA.

EXPECTING PRECIPITATION TO REMAIN TO OUR WEST TODAY. FORECAST
PROBLEM WILL BE HIGH TEMPERATURES. WE ALREADY HAVE SEVERAL SIGHTS
WITHIN 3 TO 5 DEGREES OF FORECAST HIGHS. WILD CARD WILL BE STRENGTH
OF COOL ADVECTION. CURRENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT FORECAST OVER
SOUTHERN HALF OF AREA WILL NEED BUMPED UP ONE CATEGORY. WILL LOOK

432 AM CDT TUE MAY 24 2005

.DISCUSSION...
A WEAK AND BROAD FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS BISECTING THE FORECAST AREA
THIS MORNING...WITH DRIER AIR TO THE NORTH OF THE FRONT OVER
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA AND MORE HUMID AIRMASS TO THE SOUTH.
THIS FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO SINK SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY WITH DRIER
AIRMASS AND LOWER DEWPOINTS FILTERING SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE
REMAINDER OF THE MIDSOUTH. THIS FRONT SHOULD REMAIN WEAK AND
DIFFUSE...SO NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIPITATION WITH THIS FEATURE.

ANOTHER MCS HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES AND IS
MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARDS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS
FEATURE IS EXPECTED TO STAY TO OUR WEST AND WEAKEN TODAY...WITH ONLY
SOME HIGH CIRRUS MOVING THROUGH MAINLY WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA
THIS MORNING. CLOUD COVER SHOULD REMAIN THIN ENOUGH AND SCATTERED TO
ALLOW FOR MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AREAWIDE. TEMPERATURES SHOULD ONLY
REACH THE LOW 80S NORTH...WHERE LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE
FRONT KEEPS TEMPERATURES DOWN. ELSEWHERE...THE COLD ADVECTION WILL
BE WEAKER...SO EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO REACH THE MID 80S CENTRAL AND
UPPER 80S SOUTHERN SECTIONS.

THE MIDSOUTH WILL REMAIN ANCHORED BETWEEN AN UPPER LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM SPINNING OVER THE NORTHEAST U.S. AND AN UPPER RIDGE OVER THE
DESERT SOUTHWEST. THIS MEANS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL PERSIST OVER
THE AREA THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. MODELS ARE INDICATING THAT
ANOTHER MCS WILL FORM OVER THE PLAINS STATES TONIGHT AND DIVE
SOUTHEASTWARD ALONG THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THE UPPER RIDGE
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY MORNING. THE NAM/GFS HANDLING THIS
FEATURE A BIT DIFFERENTLY...WITH THE NAM FURTHER WEST THAN GFS. AT
THIS POINT...THINK THAT WITH CURRENTLY EVOLVING UPPER PATTERN THAT
THIS MCS SHOULD REMAIN TO OUR WEST. SO HAVE KEPT POPS OUT OF THE
FORECAST THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES ON WEDNESDAY...HAVE TRIMMED A FEW DEGREES OFF OF
HIGH TEMPS AS LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION CONTINUES OVER THE AREA.
STILL HAVE REMAINED ABOVE GUIDANCE THOUGH...AS THINK MODELS ARE
OVERDOING THE COLD ADVECTION SCENARIO.

A NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE
MIDSOUTH ON THURSDAY...AND WILL HELP TO SEND A WEAK COLD FRONT
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA. MOISTURE IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS FRONT
WILL REMAIN LIMITED...SO HAVE ONLY INCLUDED A 20 POP FOR SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH THIS FEATURE. IF MODEL TRENDS CONTINUE
DRIER...MAY NEED TO REMOVE POPS ALL TOGETHER IN LATER FORECASTS.

THIS FRONT WILL STALL ON FRIDAY SOUTH OF THE AREA AS THE UPPER FLOW
BECOMES MORE ZONAL....THEN START TO SLOWLY LIFT BACK TO THE NORTH
AS A WARM FRONT TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEKEND. AT THE SAME TIME...A
SERIES OF WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL MOVE THROUGH THE ZONAL
FLOW ALOFT...SO HAVE INCLUDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AND
MONDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE FEATURES. TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY WARM
UP AGAIN FOR THE END OF THE WEEKEND AND FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK.

REMNANTS OF DYING MCS EXITING OUR AREA AT MID-AFTERNOON. SIGNIFICANT
PRECIPITATION...IF THERE WAS ANY...DEPARTING AS WELL. CLOUDS HAVE
THINNED CONSIDERABLY...AND TEMPERATURES RECOVERING TO MIDDLE AND
UPPER 80S. AIRMASS HAS STABILIZED SIGNFICANTLY FROM THIS MORNING.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH THURSDAY)...
FLOW REMAINS NORTHWESTERLY THROUGH THE SHORT TERM FORECAST PERIOD.
CURRENT UPPER LOW OVER NE U.S. EXPECTED TO REMAIN NEARLY IN PLACE
THROUGH THURSDAY. SECOND UPPER LOW OVER CANADIAN ROCKIES/PRAIRIES
ISNT EXPECTED TO MOVE MUCH EITHER. THIS SYSTEM MAY EJECT A COUPLE
OF IMPULSES OVER THE NORTHERN MEXICO RIDGE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS. BEST AREAS FOR MCS DEVELOPMENT WILL BE WELL TO OUR NORTH IN
THE GREAT LAKES...AND WELL TO OUR WEST OVER OK AND KS. IF ANYTHING
DEVELOPS OVER OK-KS...IT SHOULD TRACK OVER THE SW HALF OF ARKANSAS...
KEEPING OUR AREA DRY.

IF THERE IS TO BE A DAY WITH PRECIPITATION...IT WOULD LIKELY BE
THURSDAY...WITH THE STRONGEST IMPULSE PASSING TO OUR NORTHEAST.
MODELS SHOW THE SHORTWAVE RIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO UPPER LOWS BREAKING
DOWN. SEE NO REASON TO MAKE A MAJOR CHANGE TO THE GOING FORECAST OF
20 POPS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY.

TEMPERATURES...BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPERATURES WOULD INDICATE THAT MOST
AREAS SHOULD BE 3-5 DEGREES COOLER TOMORROW THAN TODAY...AND
WEDNESDAY WILL BE 3-5 DEGREES COOLER THAN TOMORROW. THIS WOULD PUT
MOST HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S TOMORROW AND WITHIN A COUPLE
OF DEGREES OF 80 ON WEDNESDAY. THURSDAY SHOULD SEE TEMPERATURES
MODERATE A FEW DEGREES...EVEN WITH CLOUDS.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER THURSDAY)...
FLOW REMAINS NORTHWESTERLY THROUGH MONDAY. MAIN TRACK FOR CONVECTIVE
COMPLEXES APPEARS TO REMAIN WEST OF US THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY.
GFS/NAM/HPC GUIDANCE ALL INDICATE CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY
AS UPPER RIDGE SLOWLY RETROGRADES OFF THE WEST COAST. WILL INTRODUCE
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION FOR DAY 7...BUT CONFIDENCE NOT VERY HIGH AT
THIS TIME.

VERY LITTLE WARM OR COLD ADVECTION GOING ON DURING THE EXTENDED
PERIOD...THEREFORE LITTLE CHANGE IN TEMPERATURES IN FORECAST.
READINGS PRETTY CLOSE TO NORMAL FOR FRIDAY THROUGH THE MEMORIAL DAY
HOLIDAY.

LARGE MCS OVER NE OK/SW MO AND NW AR WL BE THE MAIN FACTOR FOR 
TODAYS WEATHER ACRS MUCH OF THE MID SOUTH. THE SYSTEM WL TRACK SE 
ACRS AR INTO THE SWRN SXNS OF THE CWFA THIS MORNING AS IT MOVES 
ALONG THE NOSE OF THE SHIFTING 850 MB LOW LEVEL JET. GOOD MOISTURE 
TRANSPORT INTO THIS AREA WITH PRECIP H20 VALUES AROUND 2 INCHES. 
THIS MCS WL BE IN ITS WEAKENING STAGE AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE SW 
SXNS OF OUR AREA...BASICALLY SW OF MEM. HOWEVER WITH DEEP MOISTURE 
IN PLACE AND MARGINAL INSTABILITY...LIFTED INDICES OF -2C TO 
-4C...SOME HEAVY RAINFALL MAY BE POSSIBLE SW OF MEM...ESPECIALLY IN 
THE CLARKSDALE REGION. 

WEAK SFC FRONT WL START NOSING SOUTH INTO NRN SXNS BY 00Z. DUE TO 
THE SLOWER MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT WL EXPAND PRECIP CHANCES NORTH A 
LITTLE INTO JBR AND JUST SOUTH OF MKL TODAY. TEMPS WL BE DIFFICULT 
TODAY. LIKELY TO BE WARMER FROM MKL TOWARD THE NE WHERE MORE SUN IS 
POSSIBLE. COOLER UNDER MCS BUT IF THE SUN BREAKS OUT RECOVERY WILL 
TAKE A VERY SHORT TIME. MID 80S SEEMS LIKE A GOOD COMPROMISE.

WITH FRONT HUNG UP A LITTLE WL KEEP A SMALL POP ACRS SW SXNS IN THE 
EVENING OTRW DRY TONIGHT. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES IN TUE 
THROUGH WED AS THE FRONT WL REMAIN STNRY JUST WEST AND SOUTH OF THE 
AREA TUE AND WED. ANY TSTM ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN SW OF THE REGION. 

NEXT SYSTEM DROPS OUT OF THE CNTRL PLAINS ON THU. EXPECT ANOTHER 
WEAK FRONT TO SWING THROUGH THU/THU NIGHT. THE WEAKENING FRONT LOOKS 
STARVED FOR MOISTURE AND ONLY SMALL POPS ARE NEEDED.

FRI THROUGH THE WEEKEND...TROF SETTLES IN ACRS THE ERN U.S. WITH DRY 
AND COOLER NW FLOW ACRS THE MID SOUTH. 00Z SHOWS CONSISTENCY WITH 
KEEPING PRECIP SUPPRESSED ACRS TX AND THE LOWER MS VALLEY THROUGH

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD FRONT STILL 
ROUGHLY ALONG I-44 FROM SAINT LOUIS TO TULSA THIS EVENING. MCS LOCATED ACROSS 
CENTRAL ARKANSAS CONTINUES TO MOVE SOUTHEAST BUT INFRARED IMAGERY 
OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS HAS INDICATED WARMING CLOUD 
TOPS...INDICATIVE OF DECAYING CONVECTIVE SYSTEM. CURRENT TRENDS 
SUGGEST ANY CONVECTION WILL BE ISOLATED AT BEST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
WITH BEST CHANCES ACROSS SOUTHWEST ONE THIRD OF AREA. AS A 
RESULT...WILL LOWER POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE WITH MOST AREAS REMAINING 
DRY OVERNIGHT. ANY ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS THAT DO DEVELOP SHOULD 
REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. SPC DAY1 OUTLOOK AGREES WITH CURRENT 
THINKING FOR OVERNIGHT.

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 224 PM CDT SUN MAY 22 2005

A CUT OFF LOW IS IN PLACE OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. WHILE A SECOND 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS OVER LAKE SUPERIOR. AN UPPER RIDGE IS 
ORIENTED OVER THE MOUNTAIN WEST AND CENTERED OVER THE LOWER ROCKIES. 
A COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM NEAR ST LOUIS TO NEAR TULSA AND INTO THE 
TEXAS PANHANDLE WHERE THERE IS ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE 
REMNANTS OF THE MCS FROM EARLY THIS MORNING HAVE DISSIPATED AS 
EXPECTED. TEMPERATURES HAVE YET TO WARM OVER MUCH OF NORTHWEST 
TENNESSEE WHERE A WAKE LOW FROM THIS MCS STILL PERSIST. ELSEWHERE 
TEMPS HAVE RISEN INTO THE UPPER 80S. A BANK OF LOW CLOUDS IS PRESENT 
ALONG THE FRONT IN MISSOURI AND CONVECTION HAS BLOSSOMED OVER 
NORTHWEST ARKANSAS WHERE MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE MUCH 
BETTER...AROUND 7.5 C/KM AND THERE IS A PILING UP OF MASS IN THAT 
AREA DUE TO THE WINDS FROM THE  LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE TEXAS 
PANHANDLE TOGETHER WITH THE COLD FRONT.

THE COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE INTO AND THROUGH MUCH OF THE AREA 
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THERE REALLY IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF FORCING 
PRESENT OR UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT TO JUSTIFY MUCH MORE THAN ISOLATED 
CONVECTION ALONG THE FRONT. IT APPEARS THAT THE BEST CHANCES FOR 
RAIN ARE DUE TO CONVECTION THAT WILL FIRE OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS 
AND MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD IN THE STEERING FLOW. GFS/ETA BOTH AGREE WITH 
THIS SCENARIO AND BETTER CHANCES WOULD BE SOUTH OF A LINE FROM 
JONESBORO TO MEMPHIS TO TUPELO. EVEN THOUGH SPC CONTINUES TO HAVE 
PORTIONS OF THE REGION OUTLOOKED FOR SLIGHT RISK...FEEL THAT THE 
THREAT IS REALLY MINIMAL WITH MARGINALLY SEVERE SIZE HAIL BEING THE 
ONLY CONCEIVABLE THREAT SINCE THE BEST INSTABILITY AND UPPER SUPPORT 
IS OVER TOWARDS THE ARKANSAS/OKLAHOMA BORDER. 

GFS/ETA INDICATE THAT THE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW ACROSS SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS AND 
NORTH MISSISSIPPI AS THE FRONT SLOWLY SAGS SOUTHWARD AND CONVECTION 
FROM NORTHEAST ARKANSAS RUNS ALONG THE FRONT. HIGH TEMPS FROM 
MEMPHIS SOUTHWARD WILL LIKELY BE HINDERED SOMEWHAT DUE TO CLOUD 
COVER TOMORROW.

DRY WEATHER THEN SETS UP UNTIL MIDWEEK AS THE TWO LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEMS MERGE OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND FORM ONE RATHER LARGE 
CUT OFF LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WITH MULTIPLE VORT MAXS REVOLVING AROUND 
IT. TEMPS FOR NEXT WEEK ARE GOING TO BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE 
POSITION OF THIS CUT OFF LOW. IF THE CUT OFF LOW IS POSITIONED WHERE 
THE GFS HAS BEEN ADVERTISING IT...THEN TEMPS SHOULD BE RATHER 
PLEASANT WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOW 80S. HOWEVER...IF THIS 
SYSTEM IS EVEN SLIGHTLY EAST THAN THE GFS IS SHOWING THAN HIGHS 
COULD BE IN THE MID 80S TO NEAR 90 AS THE FWC NUMBERS ARE HINTING 
AT. FOR NOW WILL CONTINUE WITH WHAT CURRENT FORECAST SINCE THERE IS 
REALLY NO STRONG EVIDENCE TO SWAY FROM IT AT THIS POINT. 

LATER IN THE WEEK AND OVER THE WEEKEND...THE FORECAST BECOMES VERY 
COMPLICATED. GFS/EUROPEAN SHOW ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL 
BE MOVING ALONG THE TOP OF THE RIDGE. THE MODELS TRY TO ERODE THE 
EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE. THIS WOULD FORCE THE REGION INTO 
NORTHWEST FLOW WITH SEVERAL SMALL IMPULSES MOVING ALONG THE FLOW. 
ALL OF THESE IMPULSES ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING RAIN AND TIMING THESE 
SYSTEMS AND DISTINGUISHING REAL SHORTWAVE FROM MODEL NOISE IS NEARLY 
IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS POINT. UNFORTUNATELY HAVE TO BROAD BRUSH THE 
EXTENDED WITH LOW CHANCE POPS UNTIL THE MODELS CAN GET A BETTER 
HANDLE ON THE PATTERN FOR END WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...

MCS THAT HAD ENTERED NORTHWEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST ARKANSAS IS 
IN THE DISSIPATING STAGES AS INDICATED BY SATELLITE AND RADAR 
TRENDS. SKIES OVER WEST TENNESSEE...NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE 
BOOTHEEL WILL LIKELY REMAIN CLOUDY THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE 
MORNING BUT SHOULD BECOME PARTLY SUNNY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON RAPIDLY 
AS THE MCS FINISHES ITS DECAY. NOT SURE WHAT TO DO WITH TEMPS FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON. SURELY THE MCS HAS HAD SOME IMPACT ON TEMPS FOR 
TODAY...BUT ONCE THE SUN BREAKS OUT IT COULD WARM UP VERY QUICKLY. 
CONSIDERING THAT LOCATIONS OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTHWEST TN 
ARE NOT GOING TO GET MUCH IF ANY RAIN FROM THIS MCS AND SO TEMPS AS 
OF 14Z ARE IN THE MID 70S...THINK A RISE OF 15 DEGREES THIS 
AFTERNOON IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. THIS WOULD PUT HIGHS IN THESE 
LOCATIONS IN THE UPPER 80S TO NEAR 90. FURTHER NORTH ACROSS THE 
BOOTHEEL...NORTHWEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WHERE TEMPS 
ARE IN THE MID 60S...LOWER TO MID 80S SEEMS MORE REALISTIC. WILL 
MONITOR TEMPS AT 15Z...BUT MAY LEAVE TEMPS ALONE FOR NOW OR RISE 
THEM TO NEAR 90 AROUND TUPELO WHERE CLOUD COVER HASNT BEEN AS THICK. 
RAIN CHANCES FOR THIS AFTERNOON STILL LOOK PRETTY MEAGER WITH THE 
FRONT NOT ARRIVING UNTIL TONIGHT AND THE MCS LIKELY FURTHER 
SUPPRESSING THE INSTABILITY POTENTIAL THAT WAS ALREADY RATHER 
MARGINAL.

THIS MCS STARTS TO REALLY FALL APART...WHICH THE MODELS INDICATE 
SHOULD HAPPEN...THEN POPS WL NEED TO BE INCREASED ACRS MUCH OF THE

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 202 PM CDT SAT MAY 21 2005...

MAIN UPPER LEVEL FEATURES INVOLVE A RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES AND A LOW OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH 
PRESSURE EXTENDING FROM TEXARKANA THROUGH THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND 
UP INTO MICHIGAN IS PROVIDING THE MIDSOUTH WITH DRY WEATHER TODAY. A 
FEW CU HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO SOMEWHAT 
MOIST LOW LEVELS STILL. TEMPS HAVE BEHAVED AS FORECASTED FOR THE 
MOST PART. THE AIRPORT READING IS A BIT HIGHER THAN SURROUNDING 
OBS...PERHAPS ITS A LITTLE DRIER THERE. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS 
MOVING ALONG THE TOP OF THE RIDGE ROUGHLY ALONG THE CANADIAN/NORTH 
DAKOTA BORDER. THERE IS A COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDS SOUTHWARD INTO THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS FROM THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.

THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT RESULTING 
IN LIGHT WINDS AND MAINLY CLEAR SKIES. MODELS INDICATE SOME HIGH 
LEVEL DEBRIS MOVING IN OVERNIGHT FROM POSSIBLE CONVECTION OVER THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS...BUT WILL ALLOW EVENING SHIFT TO TAKE A LOOK AT IT 
AND UPDATE TO PARTLY CLOUDY IF WARRANTED. 

ON SUNDAY...HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OFF TO THE EAST BRINGING 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW BACK INTO THE REGION. THE AREA IS OUTLOOKED BY 
SPC FOR A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW. THIS FOCUS 
IS MAINLY WEST OF THE MIDSOUTH WHERE THE FRONT MAY IGNITE SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE LATE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON OVER SOUTHEAST 
KANSAS AND SOUTHWEST MISSOURI. THE AIR MASS OUT THERE IS VERY 
UNSTABLE WITH LIS AROUND -6 AND CAPE AROUND 3500 J/KG. THE MID LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES OUT THERE ARE FAVORABLE FOR SEVERE WEATHER AS 
WELL...GREATER THAN 7 C/KM. THE ENVIRONMENT OVER OUR AREA IS NOT AS 
GOOD...LIS AROUND -4 WITH CAPE 2000-2500 J/KG AND MID LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES 6 TO 6.5 C/KM WHICH IS LESS FAVORABLE. IF THUNDERSTORMS FIRE 
IN SOUTHERN MISSOURI TOMORROW AFTERNOON...THEY SHOULD OUTRUN THE 
FRONT SINCE THE STEERING FLOW IS OUT OF THE NORTHWEST. IF THEY 
SHOULD HAPPEN TO MAKE IT INTO EASTERN ARKANSAS AND POINTS 
WESTWARD....WOULD EXPECT THEM TO AT LEAST BE NOT AS STRONG AS THEY 
WERE. ANY SEVERE POTENTIAL HERE IS MORE LIKELY TO BE MORE OF A 
MARGINAL HAIL THREAT WITH SOME GUSTY WINDS. WITH THE WINDS TURNING 
SOUTHWESTERLY TOMORROW...TEMPS SHOULD WARM INTO THE MID 80S TO 
AROUND 90...WITH SOME AREAS FROM MEMPHIS SOUTHWARD POSSIBLY GETTING 
INTO THE LOWER 90S DEPENDING UPON AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER TOMORROW. 
CONTINUING WITH LOW POPS TOMORROW SINCE THE BETTER FORCING IS WELL 
NORTHEAST OF US AND THE BEST INSTABILITY IS WEST OF US. THE FRONT 
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION TOMORROW NIGHT WITH CONTINUED RAIN 
CHANCES ACROSS THE REGION. 

THE FRONT SHOULD BE MAINLY SOUTH OF THE REGION BY MONDAY MORNING. 
GFS IS BEGINNING TO SUGGEST MORE AND MORE THAT THE AIR BEHIND THIS 
FRONT IS NOT AS COOL AS EXPECTED WITH OUR REGION BEING MORE 
INFLUENCED BY THE RIDGE THAN EXPECTED. AS A RESULT...HAVE ONLY 
LOWERED TEMPS FROM SUNDAY A FEW DEGREES. IT WILL BE VERY INTERESTING 
TO SEE HOW THE UPPER AIR PATTERN UNFOLDS FOR NEXT WEEK. LAST NIGHTS 
RUN OF THE GFS SHOWED ONE OF THE VORT MAXS WITH THE NORTHEAST UPPER 
LOW RETROGRADING BACK TOWARDS THE NORTHWEST INTO CENTRAL CANADA. IF 
THAT SOLUTION WOULD VERIFY THAN NEXT WEEKS FORECAST TEMPS MAY BE TOO 
COOL. TODAYS SOLUTION OF THE GFS MORE OR LESS AGREES WITH PREVIOUS 
RUNS AND WITH THIS MORNINGS RUN OF THE ETA WITH THAT PARTICULAR VORT 
STAYING WITH THE WHOLE NORTHEASTERN US SYSTEM AND MAKING A SWING 
SOUTHWARD. AS A RESULT...THE COOLER AIR SHOULD BEGIN TO FILTER INTO 
THE REGION ON TUESDAY AND LINGER THROUGH A GOOD PART OF THE WEEK. 
STILL MUCH UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST FROM MID WEEK ONWARDS. THE 
FORECAST WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON HOW FAR SOUTH THE UPPER CUT OFF LOW 
MEANDERS. THIS MORNINGS SOLUTION SHOWS THE MIDSOUTH ON THE WESTERN 
PERIPHERY WHICH WOULD KEEP THE REGION DRY TILL LATE WEEK. 
HOWEVER...IF IT DOES NOT MOVE QUITE THAT FAR SOUTH...THAN NORTHWEST 
FLOW BETWEEN THAT LOW AND THE RIDGE WILL SET UP OVER THE REGION. IN 
THIS CASE...RAIN CHANCES WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON THE WEAK IMPULSES 
MOVING ALONG IN THE FLOW.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 229 PM CDT FRI MAY 20 2005...

SYNOPTIC PATTERN CONSISTS OF A RIDGE THAT IS POSITIONED OVER THE 
MOUNTAIN WEST...A CLOSED LOW OFF OF THE EASTERN MOST CANADIAN 
PROVINCES AND A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER EASTERN KENTUCKY. A COLD 
FRONT EXTENDS SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. THIS FRONT 
RUNS FROM THE LOW INTO NORTH ALABAMA TO NEAR TUPELO AND CLARKSDALE. 
THE BETTER INSTABILITY HAS BEEN SOUTH OF TUPELO WHERE CAPES HAVE 
BEEN NEAR 3000 J/KG WITH LIS AROUND -6/-7. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE 
DEVELOPED ALONG THE FRONT THIS AFTERNOON IN NORTH MISSISSIPPI. THE 
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE UPPER 
RIDGE AND RESULTING SUBSIDENCE. MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEEN 
ACROSS ALABAMA AND MIDDLE TN WHERE UPPER DYNAMICS WITH REGARDS TO 
THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ARE AIDING DEVELOPMENT. TEMPERATURES WERE 
MUCH WARMER THAN ANTICIPATED MAINLY BECAUSE THE COOLER AIR INDICATED 
BY 850MB TEMPS WAS LAGGING WELL BEHIND THE FRONT. 

THE COLD FRONT AND ASSOCIATED CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE 
TO PRESS SOUTHWARD AND GFS/ETA INDICATE THAT THEY WILL BE INTO 
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI BY 00Z. THE AFTERNOON CU SHOULD DISSIPATE. THERE 
IS A STRATUS DECK OVER EAST CENTRAL MISSOURI AND ILLINOIS THAT COULD 
DROP SOUTHWARD. HOWEVER SUSPECT THAT IT WILL NOT MAKE IT DUE TO 
STRONG SUBSIDENCE MOVING THROUGH THE REGION IN THE WAKE OF THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM. 

AFTERNOON CU IS POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN TOMORROW WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STILL AROUND. OTHERWISE IT SHOULD BE COOLER WITH 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS WITHIN REASON. ON SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE AND FORCE A COLD 
FRONT THROUGH THE AREA. THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE DOES NOT LOOK 
TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE SO LOW POPS SEEMS JUSTIFIED FOR NOW. THIS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MERGE WITH THE CUT OFF LOW (CURRENTLY OFF SHORE 
OF THE EASTERN CANADIAN PROVINCES) OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. ON 
MONDAY. THIS WILL FILTER IN A GOOD DEAL OF COOLER DRIER AIR INTO THE 
REGION. THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK LOOKS PLEASANT WITH TEMPS IN THE 
UPPER 70S OR LOW 80S AND DEW POINTS IN THE 50S. THE NEXT THREAT FOR 
RAIN IS MID TO LATE WEEK. THE UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE NORTHWESTERLY 
WITH THE HUGE TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST AND STRONG UPPER RIDGE OVER 
THE SOUTHWEST. SEVERAL MINOR DISTURBANCES WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THE 
FLOW WHICH COULD RESULT IN SOME RAIN ANYTIME DURING THIS PERIOD.

SYNOPTIC PATTERN CONSISTS OF AN UPPER RIDGE THAT IS POSITIONED OVER 
THE MOUNTAIN WEST...A CLOSED LOW OFF OF THE EASTERN MOST CANADIAN 
PROVINCES AND A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID OHIO VALLEY REGION. 
A COLD FRONT EXTENDS WESTWARD FROM THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND IS 
ROUGHLY ALONG I 40 AT THIS TIME. THE 850MB FRONT LAGS 
BEHIND...LIKELY JUST ENTERING ARKANSAS AND WEST TENNESSEE. TEMPS 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT ARE ALREADY IN THE LOWER 80S IN MANY PLACES AHEAD 
OF THE 850 FRONT. CU FIELD IS ALREADY BEGUN. MODELS SHOWING THAT 
THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL MAY BE HINDERED THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO OUR 
PROXIMITY TO THE UPPER RIDGE AND LACK OF FORCING. 
STILL...INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT IS VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH 
AFTERNOON LIS AROUND -7 AND CAPES ABOVE 3000 J/KG POSSIBLE. THIS IS 
ASSUMES TEMPS NEAR 90 WHICH LOOKS VERY POSSIBLE GIVEN THE MORNING 
TRENDS. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE MUCH OF A CAP AHEAD OF THE FRONT 
SO THINK THAT THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT IN 
MISSISSIPPI AND BE MORE WIDESPREAD TOWARDS THE ALABAMA BORDER WHERE 
THE UPPER DYNAMICS ARE BETTER. WITH THIS MUCH INSTABILITY IN PLACE 
THERE IS A SEVERE THREAT TODAY...WITH THE MAIN THREAT BEING LARGE 
HAIL AND POSSIBLY SOME LOCALIZED GUSTY WINDS. IN REGARDS TO 
AFTERNOON TEMPS...HAVE RAISED TEMPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON. THINK THAT 
90S WILL BE FROM MEMPHIS TO SAVANNAH AND SOUTH...UPPER 80S NORTH OF

THE SHORTWAVE AND FRONT WILL MAKE STEADY PROGRESS SOUTHWARD TODAY. 
BY 18Z THE FRONT WL BE LOCATED E-W THROUGH MEM. EXPECT STRONG

TO RE-INTENSIFY ACRS N MS THIS AFTN. STORMS MAY BE SEVERE WITH LARGE 
HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS. 

ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH BY EARLY EVENING AS FRONT AND SHORTWAVE 
MOVES SOUTH OF THE CWFA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN OVERNIGHT AND 
CONTROL THE WEATHER THROUGH SAT NIGHT. 

BOTH MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH NEXT SYSTEM ON SUN/SUN NIGHT. 
LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER STRONG SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE OH VALLEY 
DURING THIS TIME FRAME WITH A FRONT SWINGING THROUGH THE MID SOUTH. 
HAVE ADDED CHC POPS FOR SUN/SUN NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN 
BEHIND THIS SYSTEM FOR THE MON THROUGH WED PERIOD. 

WED NIGHT THROUGH THU NIGHT LOOKS UNSETTLED. AS HIGH PRESSURE SLIPS

FRONT EXTENDS SOUTHWARD FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST LOW TO NEAR KANSAS 
CITY AND THEN SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS 
PANHANDLES. AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE AHEAD OF THE SURFACE FRONT IS 
MOVING THROUGH NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AT THIS TIME. SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THIS SHORTWAVE IN THE 
AFTERNOON INSTABILITY. THERE REMAINS A SLIGHT RISK OVER MUCH OF 
SEVERE WEATHER INTO THIS EVENING BECAUSE OF THE ONGOING CONVECTION. 
LARGE HAIL AND LOCALLY DAMAGING WINDS ARE POSSIBLE. THERE MAY BE A 
SECOND THREAT OVERNIGHT. 

AT LAST MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT. THE TRACK OF THE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM WILL DIVE SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH ILLINOIS...MIDDLE KY AND 
WESTERN HALF OF TN. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE AREA LATE TONIGHT AND DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. 
INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL REMAIN HIGH WITH LIS AROUND -6 
AND CAPE GREATER THAN 2000 J/KG. EXPECT AT THE VERY LEAST FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT OVER 
SOUTHEASTERN MO...POSSIBLY EVOLVING INTO AN MCS. THE BETTER CHANCES 
FOR RAIN WILL BE OVER W TN AND CLOSER TO THE TN RIVER WHERE DYNAMICS 
WITH RESPECT TO THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ARE BETTER. SEVERE THREAT 
STILL LOOKS LIKE LARGE HAIL AND LOCALLY DAMAGING WINDS. 

EXPECT THE FRONT TO BE ENTERING NORTH MS BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. SO 
RAIN CHANCES ACROSS WEST TN...NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE BOOTHEEL 
SHOULD BE MAINLY IN THE MORNING. THE SEVERE THREAT WILL REMAIN THE 
SAME AND MOVE WITH THE FRONT. WITH THE TRACK MOVING FURTHER 
EAST...THE COOLER AIR SHOULD STAY EAST OF THE REGION. 850 TEMPS WILL 
ONLY SLIP A FEW DEGREES SO SURFACE HIGHS WILL STILL BE IN THE LOW TO 
MID 80S FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

INTERESTING PATTERN SETTING UP ON SUNDAY AND GOING INTO NEXT WEEK. 
ANOTHER SYSTEM WILL MOVE OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE AND HEAD TOWARDS 
THE NORTHEASTERN US. THIS WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT THROUGH ON SUNDAY. 
THE UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION AND DEPTH OF MOISTURE WITH THE FRONT ARE 
REALLY MARGINAL SO HAVE LEFT RAIN CHANCES OUT FOR NOW. THE GFS FOR 
THE PAST COUPLE OF RUNS...SUPPORTED BY THE EUROPEAN...SHOWS THIS 
SYSTEM MERGING WITH THE CUT OFF LOW OVER NEW ENGLAND. THE RESULT IS 
A LARGE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE US. AS IT STANDS 
RIGHT NOW...LOOKS LIKE WE WILL REMAIN ON THE VERY WESTERN PERIPHERY 
OF THIS TROUGH. MAY NEED TO BEGIN TO TREND TEMPS DOWN INTO THE 70S 
FOR HIGHS FOR NEXT WEEK IF THIS SOLUTION CONTINUES TO HOLD. THE GFS 
SHOWS A SHORTWAVE ARRIVING NEXT THURSDAY RESULTING IN A CHANCE FOR 
RAIN. ALTHOUGH...THE SYSTEM LOOKS RATHER WEAK AND AM NOT VERY 
CONFIDENT IN THIS SOLUTION THIS FAR OUT.

A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS ENTERING WESTERN WISCONSIN AT THIS 
TIME. AN UPPER RIDGE IS BUILDING OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE US 
WHILE A CLOSED LOW IS ANCHORED OFF OF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST. A 
STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDS SOUTHWARD FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST LOW TO 
NEAR KANSAS CITY AND THEN SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE OKLAHOMA AND 
TEXAS PANHANDLES. AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE AHEAD OF THE SURFACE 
FRONT IS MOVING THROUGH SOUTH CENTRAL MISSOURI. A DECK OF LOW LEVEL 
CU AND STRATUS LIES JUST AHEAD OF THE SHORTWAVE ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS AND THROUGH SOUTH CENTRAL MISSOURI. OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH...SKIES ARE PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY AT THIS TIME. EXPECT CU 
DEVELOPMENT SHORTLY. TEMPS WITH THE MORNING SUN HAVE SHOT UP WITH 
MANY LOCATIONS IN THE 80S. ALTHOUGH PARTLY SUNNY SKIES THIS 
AFTERNOON WILL SLOW DOWN THE TEMPS...THINK THAT MANY AREAS WILL BE 
IN THE UPPER 80S TO AROUND 90 DUE TO THE HEAD START ON TEMPS THIS 
MORNING. WILL LEAVE IN RAIN CHANCES FOR THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO THE 
SHORTWAVE MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD. ALSO AIR MASS VARIETY THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE ALSO POSSIBLE SINCE THERE REALLY ISNT MUCH OF A CAP IN PLACE AND 
INSTABILITY IS DESCENT...LI AROUND -4 AND CAPES AROUND 1500 J/KG. 
THE AREA IS OUTLOOKED BY SPC FOR SLIGHT RISK. THIS THREAT IS MAINLY 
A HAIL THREAT WITH ADDED FORCING ALONG THE SHORTWAVE AS IT MOVES 
INTO THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON.

.DISCUSSION...

FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WHICH
INDICATES A RETURN OF MORE SIGNIFICANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. THE 60
DEGREE ISODROSOTHERM HAS FINALLY REACHED MEM AND TUP. EXPECT
DEWPOINTS TO CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY RISE UNDER A LIGHT TO MODERATE
SOUTHERLY WIND. 

THE UPPER RIDGE WHICH HAS PROVIDED THE REGION WITH SUCH NICE
WEATHER WILL GIVE WAY TO THE NEXT SHORTWAVE...CURRENTLY OVER THE
DAKOTAS. MODEL AGREEMENT IS CERTAINLY LACKING IN REGARDS TO THE
TRACK OF THIS SHORTWAVE. THE MAIN QUESTION IS HOW THE SHORTWAVE
INTERACTS WITH THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER NEW ENGLAND.
NAM/UKMET/CANADIAN TEND TO BRING THE SHORTWAVE FURTHER
EAST...TRYING TO PHASE IT WITH A PIECE OF THE UPPER LOW.
MEANWHILE...THE GFS/NOGAPS/EURO BRING THE SHORTWAVE MUCH FURTHER
SOUTH...RIGHT OVER THE CWA. OF COURSE...THESE DIFFERENT TRACKS
MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN WHAT TYPE OF RAIN CHANCES THE MIDSOUTH
WILL HAVE. WILL LEAN TOWARD A BLEND OF THE GFS/NOGAPS/EURO SOLUTION.
THIS HAS BEEN THE MORE CONSISTENT SOLUTION. ALSO...WITH THE NORTH
ATLANTIC OSCILLATION (NAO) BEING STRONGLY NEGATIVE THERE WILL TEND
TO BE STRONGER BLOCKING UPSTREAM...ALLOWING THE SHORTWAVE TO TAKE
A FURTHER SOUTH SOLUTION. 

MODELS DO HINT AT AN MCS DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT OVER THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS. THIS WOULD LIKELY TRACK INTO THE MIDSOUTH DURING THE
MIDDLE OF THE DAY TOMORROW WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF HEATING
OCCURRING AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. NOT TOO IMPRESSED WITH THE PROSPECTS
OF SEVERE WEATHER. MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE MARGINAL (APPROX 6
C/KM) AND WIND FIELDS ARE FAIRLY LIGHT. CANNOT RULE OUT AN
ISOLATED PULSE SEVERE WITH STRONG WINDS AND HAIL AS THE MAIN
THREAT. WILL MAKE A MENTION OF ISOLATED SEVERE IN THE HWO BUT WILL
DOWNPLAY FOR NOW. FOR POPS...WENT HIGH CHANCE NORTH WHERE THE
BETTER FORCING WILL BE TO LOW END CHANCE TOWARD THE SOUTH.

CHANCE POPS WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY AS THE
SHORTWAVE SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE AREA ALONG WITH ITS ASSOCIATED
FRONT. THE SYSTEM LOOKS RATHER PROGRESSIVE SO HAVE ENDED ALL POPS
BY 6Z SATURDAY. UPPER RIDGE OVER TEXAS WILL NOSE INTO THE AREA FOR
THE WEEKEND MAKING FOR A DRY FORECAST. 

A WEAK FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH UNDER NORTHEAST FLOW
ALOFT LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. DEEP MOISTURE REALLY LACKING WITH
THE SYSTEM SO LEFT POPS OUT. ANOTHER FRONT APPROACH WEDNESDAY INTO
THURSDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL HAVE SOME BETTER MOISTURE TO WORK WITH
SO INCLUDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF PRECIP. TEMPS THROUGHOUT THE
FORECAST WILL BE AT OR JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL.

THE MIDSOUTH IS ENJOYING YET ANOTHER TRANQUIL DAY UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE. WITH SURFACE HIGH POSITIONED
WELL TO THE EAST...STARTING TO SEE DEWPOINTS COME UP SLOWLY.
RETURN FLOW IS STILL FAIRLY WEAK (WINDS LESS THAN 10 KTS) SO UPPER
60 DEWPOINTS OBSERVED JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE CWA HAVING A HARD

ACARS SOUNDINGS FROM MEM SHOW THE AREA MIXING ALL THE WAY UP TO

TEMPS ALREADY 10 DEGREES AHEAD OF WHERE THEY WERE THIS TIME
YESTERDAY. AS A RESULT...BUMPED HIGHS UP IN THE GRIDS A DEGREE OR

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE CUTOFF LOW GETS CAUGHT IN THE FLOW AROUND A
MAJOR TROUGH IN NEW ENGLAND AND MOVES SOUTH RIGHT AT US...UNUSUAL

THIS SYSTEM SHOULD REMAIN OVER THE AREA OVERNIGHT KEEPING WEATHER
CONDITIONS DRY. EVENING IR SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING A FEW HIGH THIN

THE CLOUD COVER SHOULD REMAIN THIN ENOUGH...SO CURRENT FORECAST OF

LEVEL RIDGING FINALLY TRANSLATES EAST ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
BEFORE NEXT SYSTEM EJECTS OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE

WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...LONG RANGE MODEL RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IS
WORSE TODAY AND THUS CONFIDENCE IS LOW. LONG RANGE FORECAST

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
1100 AM CDT SUN MAY 15 2005

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND VISIBLE SATELLITE PLACE 
SECONDARY COLD FRONT ACROSS NORTHERN ALABAMA/CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. 
ONLY A FEW CIRRUS AT BEST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS SHOW SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE AROUND 850 MB BELOW SUBSIDENCE 
INVERSION AND SOME COLD AIR STRATOCUMULUS MAINLY ALONG AND NORTH OF 
I-44...BUT SUSPECT MOST OF THE MOISTURE WILL MIX OUT ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH. CURRENT FORECAST ON TRACK WILL NOT ISSUE AN UPDATE UNLESS 
CLOUDS INCREASE MORE THAN ANTICIPATED. 

CJC

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 222 AM CDT SUN MAY 15 2005...

COLD FRONT HAS SLOWED CONSIDERABLY AND HAS HUNG UP OVER PORTIONS OF
NORTH MISSISSIPPI...NEAR A MSL-TUP-GLH LINE. STILL A FEW SHOWERS OVER
EXTREME SOUTHEAST CORNER OF CWA. MAY NEED TO LINGER THESE INTO THE
FIRST COUPLE OF HOURS OF THE FORECAST. TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM MID
50S NORTH TO MID 60S SOUTH.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH TUESDAY)...
AFTER FRONT MOVES OUT OF AREA THIS MORNING...NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER
THROUGH TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES IN GOING FORECAST FOR TODAY LOOK
REASONABLE...WITH A DEGREE OR TWO OF WARMING ON MONDAY. ADDITIONAL
WARMING OF ABOUT 5 OR 6 DEGREES FOR TUESDAY. CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT
WINDS TONIGHT SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO FALL NEAR DEWPOINTS IN NORMALLY
COOLER AREAS. DRY AIRMASS SHOULD ALLOW GROUND TO DRY OUT TODAY...
WHICH SHOULD LESSEN POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD FOG TONIGHT. MINOR
MODERATION IN DEWPOINTS AND FLOW GOING SOUTHEASTERLY SHOULD ALLOW
MINS MONDAY NIGHT TO BE A LITTLE WARMER.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER TUESDAY)...
SHORTWAVE RIDGE OVER CENTRAL PORTION OF THE COUNTRY ON TUESDAY
SHOULD BREAK DOWN OVER THE FOLLOWING SEVERAL DAYS. THIS WILL ALLOW A
COLD FRONT TO GET PUSHED THROUGH THE AREA ON THURSDAY. WIND PATTERNS
WILL NOT PERMIT SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...
SO CURRENT POPS IN FORECAST APPEAR TO BE GOOD. FRIDAY AND SATURDAY
SHOULD BE DRY. MEX GUIDANCE FOR END OF WEEK A LITTLE WARMER THAN
LAST NIGHT. HAVE TRENDED HIGHS UP A COUPLE OF DEGREES...BUT NOT TO
THE EXTENT OF MEX GUIDANCE. RUNNING ABOVE MOST NEIGHBORS ON
TEMPERATURES. STILL QUITE A SPREAD AMONG EXTENDED MODELS...BUT
TEMPERATURES SUPPORTED BY 14/18Z DGEX SOLUTION.

.DISCUSSION...

FRONT HAS SLOWED CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS AND HAS
HUNG UP OVER PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI...MAINLY SOUTHEAST
OF TUPELO. HAVE UPDATED FORECAST TO LINGER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
OVER THESE AREAS UNTIL AROUND 3 AM. SHOULD SEE RAIN DIMINISH OVER
THESE AREAS AFTER 3 AM...WITH SKIES GRADUALLY BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY
OVER THESE AREAS BEFORE SUNRISE. UPDATES OUT SHORTLY.


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FROM 924 PM...

AT 02Z...SURFACE COLD FRONT WAS STRETCHED ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE CWA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE ALONG AND
JUST BEHIND THE COLD FRONT THIS EVENING. EXPECT THE COLD FRONT TO
CONTINUE TO MOVE FURTHER SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL BRING AN END
TO CONVECTION AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS.

THE BACK EDGE OF THE THICKER CLOUDS NOW EXTENDING ROUGHLY FROM
MARTIN TENNESSEE TO MEMPHIS TENNESSEE TO CLARKSDALE MISSISSIPPI.
EXPECT SKIES TO CONTINUE TO CLEAR FROM THIS LINE EAST OVERNIGHT.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...KEPT FORECAST LOWS FROM AROUND 50 NORTHWEST
TO UPPER 50S SOUTHEAST. DECENT LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE
FRONT WILL HELP TO FILTER COOLER AIRMASS SOUTHWARD. DEWPOINTS WILL
ALSO CONTINUE TO FALL BEHIND THE FRONT.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING VERY PLEASANT WEATHER TO THE MIDSOUTH ON
SUNDAY...WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND TEMPERATURES ABOUT 10 DEGREES
BELOW NORMAL WITH LOW HUMIDITIES.

UPDATED ZONE FORECAST AND GRIDS OUT SHORTLY.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FROM 326 PM...

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD FRONT STRETCHING
FROM LEXINGTON TN TO PINE BLUFF AR. A SECONDARY COLD FRONT WITH A
REINFORCING SHOT OF COOL AIR STRETCHES FROM EASTERN LAKE SUPERIOR TO
THE CENTRAL PLAINS. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN THIS PACKAGE IS ONGOING
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE COLD FRONT LATE THIS AFTERNOON.

TONIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS EAST FROM THE MID
SOUTH. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS RE-DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST COUPLE
OF HOURS ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND WILL AFFECT THE SOUTHERN ONE
THIRD OF THE AREA TONIGHT. EXPECTING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO
COME TO AN END MOSTLY BY MIDNIGHT ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI WITH
ONLY AN ISOLATED HAIL THREAT THIS EVENING WITH THE THUNDERSTORMS.
SKIES WILL CLEAR TONIGHT AS MID/UPPER LEVEL SUBSIDENCE BUILDS DOWN
TOWARD THE SURFACE.

SUNDAY...PLEASANT BUT COOLER DAY EXPECTED AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
INTO THE MID SOUTH. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW SOME HIGH BASED
STRATOCUMULUS DEVELOPING ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA AS
RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BECOMES TRAPPED UNDER SUBSIDENCE
INVERSION. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO MIDDLE 70S AS MODIFIED
COOLER AIR FILTERS IN ACROSS THE AREA.

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...A WEAK SHORTWAVE EMBEDDED IN NORTHWEST
FLOW WILL AFFECT THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT AND
MONDAY. HOWEVER...NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIPITATION WITH THIS FEATURE
AND ONLY CLOUDS WITH LIMITED MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC DESCENT.
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL BEGIN TO RETURN TO THE MID SOUTH ON TUESDAY AS
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BUILDS AND TEMPERATURES GRADUALLY INCREASE.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...SOME MODEL DISAGREEMENTS IN THE LONG
RANGE FORECAST...ESPECIALLY WITH THE PAST FEW RUNS OF THE EUROPEAN.
GFS/DGEX PRODUCE ZONAL FLOW WITH NW FLOW ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. 00Z
EUROPEAN HAS STARTED TO TREND TOWARDS THE OTHER SOLUTIONS BUT IS
STILL AN OUTLIER WITH A STRONGER BLOCKING PATTERN ACROSS NORTH
AMERICA. AS A RESULT...WILL LEAN TOWARDS GFS/DGEX SOLUTION.

NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL DROP
SOUTH FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MID SOUTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AND THURSDAY AND ADDED POPS TO FORECAST. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN
BUILD BACK IN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THROUGH SATURDAY.

.DISCUSSION...15Z SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD FRONT FROM THE OHIO 
VALLEY SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS. 
MAIN CONCERN IS CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL THIS AFTERNOON. LATEST RADAR 
TRENDS SHOW CONVECTION MAINLY ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE. 12Z MODEL INITIALIZATION NOT HANDLING ONGOING 
CONVECTION WELL RIGHT NOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BUT THINK THAT 
FRONT WILL REACH NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI BY LATE AFTERNOON. 

VERY MARGINAL SEVERE THREAT WILL BEGIN TO DIMINISH ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA AS CONVECTIVE BOUNDARY IS ABOUT TO DEPART NORTHERN 
MISSISSIPPI. WILL ISSUE AN UPDATE BASED UPON CURRENT FORECAST TRENDS.

TODAY...CROSSING THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AROUND 18Z OR SO. WHILE SOME

SEE SOME PRECIPITATION TODAY...AND WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS FOR MOST
OF THE AREA.

SEVERE PARAMETERS ARE NOT AS STRONG TODAY AS THEY WERE YESTERDAY...

SURFACE CAPES 1000-1500 J/KG. 700-500 MB LAPSE RATES GENERALLY BELOW

CONVECTION AND WEAKER INSTABILITY ARGUE AGAINST MENTIONING IN
ZONES. HAVE LOWERED HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY A COUPLE OF DEGREES
DUE TO ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER. WILL HOLD LOW POPS IN FOR SOUTHEAST
PORTION OF CWA FOR TONIGHT. SEE LITTLE NEED TO CHANGE TEMPERATURES
FOR TONIGHT.

HIGH PRESSURE MOVES IN FROM GREAT PLAINS FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. MUCH

PULSE DIURNAL CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPED THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY
THIS EVENING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH HAS DIMINISHED WITH THE LOSS OF
DAYTIME HEATING. HAVE REDUCED TO 20 POPS AREAWIDE BEFORE MIDNIGHT...
WITH POPS INCREASED FROM WEST TO EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT.

UPPER TROUGH AXIS TO OUR WEST TONIGHT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST AND
ACROSS THE REGION TOMORROW. THIS WILL HELP TO DRAG A COLD FRONT NOW
STRETCHED FROM THE GREAT LAKES ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS STATES
THIS EVENING...SLOWLY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH ON SATURDAY. CONVECTION
CONTINUES TO DEVELOP OVER PARTS OF NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND SOUTHERN
MISSOURI THIS EVENING IN ADVANCE OF THIS WEATHER SYSTEM. EXPECT

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
822 PM CDT THU MAY 12 2005

.UPDATE...
AFTERNOON CONVECTION IS QUICKLY DISSIPATING AND IS JUST ABOUT GONE
WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. WILL UPDATE TO REMOVE SHOWERS /
THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. THERE REMAINS SOME
CIRRUS BLOWUP...BUT THINK THIS WILL THIN OUT DURING THE NIGHT
LEAVING MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL
DOMINATE OUR WEATHER TONIGHT. FORECAST LOWS LOOK FINE.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 332 PM CDT THU MAY 12 2005

LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS 5-6 KFT DIURNAL CU/AC HAS FORMED
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. 88D RADAR TRENDS FROM KNQA/KGWX
INDICATE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE REMAINED BELOW SEVERE LIMITS
ACROSS A PORTION OF WESTERN TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. MAIN
CONCERN THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL THROUGH
SATURDAY.

TONIGHT...DIURNAL CONVECTION RESULTING FROM HEAT AND INSTABILITY
SHOULD BEGIN TO DIMINISH BY SUNSET ACROSS AREAS ALONG AND EAST OF A
SAVANNAH TO NEW ALBANY LINE. ANOTHER WARM NIGHT EXPECTED AS
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE MIDDLE 60S TO AROUND 70.

FRIDAY...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BREAK DOWN AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES
OFF TOWARDS THE CAROLINA COAST. A WEAK RIPPLE IN SOUTHWEST FLOW
ALOFT MAY ASSIST IN PROVIDING ENOUGH LIFT TO PRODUCE SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. MODERATE 700-500MB LAYER MID
LEVEL LAPSE RATES AROUND 6.5 C/KM...2000 J/KG SURFACE BASED
CAPE...LI/S AROUND -6/-7...AND WEAK WINDS ALOFT SUGGEST MODE OF
CONVECTION AGAIN WILL BE OF THE PULSE VARIETY. 850 MB TEMPERATURES
AROUND 16-17C WILL PRODUCE HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE 80S TO AROUND 90
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH.

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...NEARLY STATIONARY COLD FRONT WILL
FINALLY BEGIN TO MOVE TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT. NOT
THAT IMPRESSED SEVERE POTENTIAL ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. BETTER MID
LEVEL DYNAMICAL FORCING WILL REMAIN UP ACROSS THE MIDDLE AND UPPER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. IN ADDITION 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES WILL BE
AT OR BELOW 6 C/KM...EVEN WITH 1500 J/KG OF CAPE...AND LI/S AROUND
-4. COLD FRONT WILL MAKE PROGRESS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON
SATURDAY WITH PRECIPITATION COMING TO AN END BY SATURDAY EVENING AS
HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS WITH NORMAL TEMPERATURES BACK TO THE REGION.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...LONG RANGE MODELS ALL SHOW UPPER LEVEL
RIDGING RETURNING ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY NEXT WEEK BUT
SOME DIFFERENCES EXIST BY MID WEEK AS MODELS DISAGREE ON AMOUNT OF
MID LEVEL AMPLIFICATION ACROSS THE U.S. 00Z EUROPEAN SOLUTION A BIT
MORE AMPLIFIED THAN GFS AND DGEX. WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR NOW AS
PROBABILITIES REMAIN TOO LOW AT THIS TIME TO ADD POPS IN FOR DIURNAL
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS.

.DISCUSSION...12Z SURFACE AND UPPER AIR ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS 
SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. 
850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 17C ON KLZK SOUNDING THIS MORNING SUPPORT 
HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S. SURFACE TEMPERATURES ALREADY A 
COUPLE OF DEGREES HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY AND WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED 
TO SEE AT LEAST ONE OF THE TEMPERATURE RECORDS TIED OR BROKEN AT THE 
OBSERVATION SITES. MOST AREAS SHOULD STAY DRY THIS AFTERNOON WITH 
WEAK SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IN PLACE. LATEST 88D TRENDS 
FROM KNQA/KGWX SHOW ISOLATED CONVECTION BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ACROSS 
THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA MAINLY ALONG AND EAST OF A 
LINE FROM SAVANNAH TO RIPLEY. STABILITY PARAMETERS INDICATE 3000 
J/KG CAPE...LI/S AROUND -8...HIGH FREEZING LEVELS...AND WEAK UPPER 
LEVEL WINDS. AS A RESULT...EXPECTING CONVECTION TO REMAIN AS PULSE 
TYPE AND BELOW SEVERE LIMITS. IN ADDITION...MODEL SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE SOME HIGH BASED DIURNAL CUMULUS MAY DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. 
WILL MONITOR CONVECTIVE TRENDS THIS AFTERNOON BUT THINK CONVECTION 
WILL REMAIN MOSTLY ACROSS AREAS CURRENTLY BEING AFFECTED.

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

CAN FELT WITH THE HIGHER DEW POINTS AND SCT/BKN CU FIELD. ISOLATED
STORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN NORTHWESTERN ALABAMA THIS AFTERNOON.
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS ANCHORED OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S.

THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS OVER THE MIDWEST WILL TRANSLATE SLOWLY
EASTWARD TONIGHT. THIS WILL CAUSE NEAR RECORD WARMTH FOR MUCH OF THE
AREA WITH MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES REACHING NEAR 90 DEGREES. SOME HIGH
CLOUDS WILL ALSO ADVANCE INTO THE REGION TOMORROW BUT THEY SHOULD BE
THIN ENOUGH TO ALLOW MAX TEMPS TO REACH NEAR 90.

THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BREAK DOWN AND MOVE FARTHER EAST FRIDAY NIGHT

A SHORTWAVE WILL BE APPROACHING THE MID SOUTH SATURDAY...AND IT WILL
BE FOLLOWED QUICKLY BY A WEAKER WAVE ON SUNDAY. RIDGING WILL TAKE
PLACE OVER THE AREA...AS AN UPPER LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE DEEP SOUTH

.UPDATE...
WILL UPDATE FORECAST / GRIDS TO REMOVE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT. EARLIER CONVECTION HAS
DISSIPATED WITH SUNSET. 00Z 500 MB ANALYSIS INDICATES UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH LOCATED THROUGH THE EASTERN HALF OF THE MIDSOUTH. CAN NOT
TOTALLY RULE OUT A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM POPPING UP AS THIS TROUGH
CONTINUES MOVING EAST...BUT DO NOT THINK PROBABILITY IS HIGH ENOUGH
TO MENTION IN THE FORECAST. OTHERWISE MOSTLY JUST CIRRUS IS BEING
OBSERVED...AND SATELLITE INDICATES THIS IS THINNING SOME. REMAINDER
OF THE FORECAST IS ON TRACK.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 303 PM CDT MON MAY 9 2005

AN UPPER LEVEL VORT IS MOVING INTO EASTERN ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON.
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE DRY SLOT AS SEEN ON
WATER VAPOR OVER MS. A LINE OF STORMS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL
SHORTWAVE EXTENDING NORTH OF THE VORT IS PRESENT OVER MISSOURI.
ALSO...THERE IS SOME SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS OVER CENTRAL
ARKANSAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VORT ITSELF.

EXPECT THAT THE ACTIVITY OVER MS WILL BE ABOUT TO MOVE INTO ALABAMA
BY 00Z. MOST OF THE ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONVECTION OVER MO
WILL LIKELY STAY JUST NORTH OF THE REGION. SO THIS LEAVES THE LIGHT
RAIN SHOWERS OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS
EVENING...RESULTING IN LOW CHANCES OF MEASURABLE RAIN. THE SLIGHT
RISK FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING WITH
THE THREAT MAINLY IN THE FORM OF HAIL. THE INSTABILITY HAS BEEN
INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON WITH LIS OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS AROUND -4
AND CAPE OF 1500 J/KG. THIS INSTABILITY WILL LIKELY MOVE EASTWARD.
SO ITS POSSIBLE THAT A STORM OR TWO COULD REACH SEVERE LIMITS.

GREAT INSTABILITY CONTINUES INTO TUESDAY WITH CAPE GREATER THAN
3000J/KG AND LIS AROUND -6. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UPPER RIDGE WILL
BE BUILDING OVER THE AREA AND THERE IS NO TRIGGER. SUPPOSE AN
ISOLATED AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORM IS POSSIBLE...BUT THE MOISTURE
REALLY DOES NOT LOOK DEEP ENOUGH. THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE AROUND FOR AFTERNOON CU FIELD. 850 TEMPS WILL BE AROUND +15
TOMORROW SUPPORTING HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S. 850 TEMPS WILL
RISE TO AROUND +16 ON WEDNESDAY WITH THE RIDGE AXIS OVERHEAD. 90
DEGREES VERY POSSIBLE. FYI...90 DEGREES IS THE RECORD HIGH FOR
MEMPHIS ON WEDNESDAY. 850 TEMPS LOOK TO COOL SLIGHTLY TOWARDS THE
END OF THE WEEK AS THE AIR MASS COMING OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST US
MODIFIES. SO DO NOT EXPECT AFTERNOON HIGHS TO BE AS WARM. RIDGE
SHOULD HOLD IN TACT UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE DOES NOT LOOK DEEP
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS DURING THIS PERIOD.

OVER THE WEEKEND...THE RIDGE WILL MOVE OFF TO THE EAST AND AN UPPER
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. THIS
WILL BRING A GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SOMETIME OVER
THE WEEKEND...IF MODELS REMAIN CONSISTENT THIS WILL MOST LIKELY BE
SATURDAY.

AN UPPER LEVEL VORT IS MOVING INTO EASTERN ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON. 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE DRY SLOT AS SEEN ON 
WATER VAPOR OVER MS. A LINE OF STORMS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL 
SHORTWAVE EXTENDING NORTH OF THE VORT IS PRESENT OVER MISSOURI. 
ALSO...THERE IS SOME SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS OVER CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VORT ITSELF. 

EXPECT THAT THE ACTIVITY OVER MS WILL BE ABOUT TO MOVE INTO ALABAMA 
BY 00Z. MOST OF THE ENERGY ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONVECTION OVER MO 
WILL LIKELY STAY JUST NORTH OF THE REGION. SO THIS LEAVES THE LIGHT 
RAIN SHOWERS OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS 
EVENING...RESULTING IN LOW CHANCES OF MEASURABLE RAIN. THE SLIGHT 
RISK FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING WITH 
THE THREAT MAINLY IN THE FORM OF HAIL. THE INSTABILITY HAS BEEN 
INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON WITH LIS OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS AROUND -4 
AND CAPE OF 1500 J/KG. THIS INSTABILITY WILL LIKELY MOVE EASTWARD. 
SO ITS POSSIBLE THAT A STORM OR TWO COULD REACH SEVERE LIMITS.

GREAT INSTABILITY CONTINUES INTO TUESDAY WITH CAPE GREATER THAN 
3000J/KG AND LIS AROUND -6. THE PROBLEM IS THAT THE UPPER RIDGE WILL 
BE BUILDING OVER THE AREA AND THERE IS NO TRIGGER. SUPPOSE AN 
ISOLATED AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORM IS POSSIBLE...BUT THE MOISTURE 
REALLY DOES NOT LOOK DEEP ENOUGH. THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE AROUND FOR AFTERNOON CU FIELD. 850 TEMPS WILL BE AROUND +15 
TOMORROW SUPPORTING HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S. 850 TEMPS WILL 
RISE TO AROUND +16 ON WEDNESDAY WITH THE RIDGE AXIS OVERHEAD. 90

AN UPPER LEVEL VORT IS OVER ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. LITTLE IN TERMS 
OF SURFACE FEATURES...JUST SOUTHERLY FLOW OVER THE REGION. SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO REDEVELOP AHEAD OF THE VORT IN EASTERN 
ARKANSAS AND THEN MOVE THROUGH NORTH MS AND WEST TN. SEVERE 
POTENTIAL THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE LARGELY DEPENDENT UPON AMOUNT OF 
SUN THAT THE AREA CAN RECEIVE AND DRY SLOT AHEAD OF UPPER VORT. 
CURRENT CONVECTION OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS IS BEING GENERATED BY DRY 
SLOT PUNCHING INTO THE REGION. SUBSIDENCE WITH UPPER VORT MAY BE TOO 
GREAT FOR SUBSTANTIAL CONVECTION. THINK THAT THE BETTER THREAT MAY 
ACTUALLY BE OVER SOUTHWEST TN AND NORTH MS THIS AFTERNOON AS THE DRY 
SLOT MOVES THROUGH THAT AREA. EVENSO...SHEAR IS REALLY WEAK 
AREAWIDE. SO LOOKING MAINLY AT PULSE VARIETY THUNDERSTORMS IF 
ANYTHING. ONLY CHANGE TO FORECAST IS TO INCREASE TO LIKELY POPS OVER 
NORTHEAST MS THIS AFTERNOON. AM VERY UNCERTAIN ABOUT AFTERNOON TEMPS 
SINCE THEY WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON CLOUD/RAIN EARLY THIS AFTERNOON.

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER ARKANSAS AND THE MIDSOUTH IS PROVIDING
SOME LIFT THAT IS TOUCHING OFF AN AREA OF RAIN THAT HAS NOW MOVED
INTO EAST CENTRAL AR. THIS AREA OF RAIN SHOULD MOVE INTO NE AR...
THE BOOTHEEL AND EXTREME NW TN BY DAYBREAK.

ANOTHER BIT OF ENERGY FROM THE TROUGH WILL IMPINGE ON THE
MIDSOUTH BY MID-MORNING ALONG WITH COLDER TEMPERATURES ALOFT.
THIS WOULD BE ENOUGH TO GENERATE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...BUT
EXTENSIVE CLD COVER IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING ALONG COOLER SURFACE
TEMPERATURES FROM THE CURRENT RAIN. IF BREAKS IN THE CLDS OCCUR
THIS MORNING...CAN EXPECT ISOLATED STORMS TO PRODUCE LARGE HAIL
LATER TDA.

THE AXIS OF THE UPPER SHT WV SHOULD BE INTO MIDDLE TN AND AL THIS
EVENING. THIS WILL LIMIT SUPPORT FOR THUNDERSTORMS...ESPECIALLY
AFTER MIDNIGHT.

MORE SHOWERS COULD OCCUR TUE BUT CHANCES ARE MUCH LESS.

THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE THAT HAS REMAINED OVER THE
MIDSOUTH DURING THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS IS BEGINNING TO BREAK DOWN
AND MOVE EAST. THIS HAS RESULTED IN INCREASED CU DEVELOPMENT ACROSS
MOST OF THE AREA...WITH TOWERING CU AND ISOLATED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER AREAS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER
THIS AFTERNOON...WHERE INSTABILITY CONTINUES TO INCREASE AND
WEAKENING UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE WAS APPROACHING. TEMPERATURES HAVE
REACHED THE LOW TO MID 80S AS OF 20Z AND THEY MAY CLIMB ANOTHER FEW
DEGREES DURING THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON.

THE AIRMASS OVER THE AREA WILL CONTINUE TO MOISTEN AND BECOME
INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE OVER THE MIDSOUTH THROUGH MONDAY...AS AN
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH POSITIONED OVER THE PLAINS STATES THIS AFTERNOON
MOVES EAST. A SERIES OF SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCES EMBEDDED WITHIN THE
UPPER TROUGH WILL ROTATE THROUGH THE AREA THROUGH TUESDAY...BEFORE
THE UPPER TROUGH PULLS EAST OF THE REGION BY TUESDAY NIGHT. THE
FIRST SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE NOW OVER ARKANSAS WILL CONTINUE TO
WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EAST ACROSS THE AREA THIS EVENING. SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE AND
WILL AFFECT MAINLY WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA EARLY TONIGHT.

A SECOND SHORTWAVE NOW ANALYZED ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER NORTH-
CENTRAL TEXAS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES THIS
EVENING AND TOWARDS THE AREA LATER TONIGHT. EXPECT A DEVELOPING MCS
OVER NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON TO MOVE TOWARDS THE AREA
LATER TONIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING. CURRENTLY EXPECTING THIS COMPLEX
OF THUNDERSTORMS TO WEAKEN OVERNIGHT AS IT APPROACHES THE MIDSOUTH...
AS MODEST LOW LEVEL JET CURRENTLY DRIVING THE CONVECTION EXPECTED
TO WEAKEN. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE ONGOING
EARLY MONDAY MORNING ACROSS MAINLY WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE REGION.
THIS ACTIVITY MAY DISSIPATE DURING THE MORNING HOURS. EXTENSIVE
CLOUD SHIELD IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE OVER THE AREA
MONDAY MORNING...WHICH MAY LIMIT DAYTIME HEATING DURING THE DAY
MONDAY. ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO
REDEVELOP OVER THE AREA ON MONDAY AND PERSIST INTO MONDAY EVENING.
SPC HAS OUTLOOKED PORTIONS OF THE AREA IN A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS FOR MONDAY. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT THE SEVERE
POTENTIAL WILL REMAIN ISOLATED ACROSS THE AREA. THE SEVERE THREAT
WILL REMAIN HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON THE AMOUNT OF BREAKS IN MORNING
CLOUD COVER THAT CAN DEVELOP BY MONDAY AFTERNOON TO PROMOTE LOW LEVEL
HEATING AND ENHANCED INSTABILITY. THE MID LEVEL COOLING ASSOCIATED
WITH THE UPPER TROUGH WILL PROMOTE ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORM
DEVELOPMENT...BUT OVERALL CLOUD COVER MAY LIMIT STORM INTENSITY. WILL
KEEP MENTION OF ISOLATED SEVERE IN THE HWO FOR NOW AND LET LATER
SHIFTS DETERMINE ANY CHANGES IN THE OVERALL THREAT.

ANOTHER WEAKER SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE MAY AFFECT THE MIDSOUTH ON
TUESDAY WITH ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN ON TUESDAY
AFTERNOON. MID-LEVEL WARMING AND A STRONGER CAPPING INVERSION WILL
LIMIT THE OVERALL COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ON TUESDAY...BUT WITH
INCREASED LEVELS OF INSTABILITY (LARGE SFC BASED CAPE)...ANY STORMS
THAT CAN INITIATE WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME PULSE SEVERE.
AGAIN...COVERAGE MAY BE RATHER LIMITED.

THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL LIFT OUT OF THE REGION BY TUESDAY
NIGHT...WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING OVER THE MIDSOUTH
FOR THE MIDDLE AND END OF THE WEEK. WITH RISING HEIGHTS AND
THICKNESSES...EXPECT DAYTIME TEMPERATURES TO RISE INTO THE MID TO
UPPER 80S WITH LOWS IN THE 60S WITH HUMID CONDITIONS. UPPER LEVEL
RIDGING WILL SUPPRESS ANY CONVECTION...SO CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN DRY
WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS
ARE EXPECTED FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY AS A COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVES
ACROSS THE AREA.

HIGH PRESSURE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT HAS PROVIDED FOR ANOTHER GREAT
WEATHER DAY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH...WITH ONLY THIN HIGH CIRRUS MOVING
OVER THE AREA...AND SCATTERED CU TO THE SOUTH. TEMPERATURES HAVE
CLIMBED INTO THE LOWER 80S THIS AFTERNOON...AND MAY CLIMB ANOTHER
DEGREE OR TWO OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE MIDSOUTH TODAY WILL REMAIN IN PLACE
INTO SUNDAY. THIS WILL KEEP WEATHER CONDITIONS DRY AND ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO WARM BACK INTO THE LOW TO MID 80S BY SUNDAY
AFTERNOON. THIS UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN BY SUNDAY
NIGHT AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN U.S. TODAY MOVES
EAST. A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES WILL ROTATE ACROSS THE AREA FROM SUNDAY
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...WITH THE STRONGEST EXPECTED ON MONDAY. BOTH THE
ETA/GFS INDICATING THAT AN MCS WILL DEVELOP OVER PORTIONS OF EASTERN
OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND MOVE EAST TOWARDS OUR AREA
SUNDAY NIGHT. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT THIS CLUSTER OF STORMS WILL
WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EAST SUNDAY NIGHT...AS THE BEST UPPER LEVEL
DYNAMICS REMAIN TO OUR NORTH AND WEST. WEAKENING SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS MAY AFFECT PORTIONS OF THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT...SO
HAVE INCLUDED CHANCE POPS WEST AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EAST.

PLENTY OF CLOUDS FROM OVERNIGHT CONVECTION WILL BE OVER THE REGION ON
MONDAY...BUT A FEW BREAKS MAY DEVELOP LATER IN THE DAY...AND AS MID
LEVEL COOLING IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
OVERSPREADS THE WARM AND MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE OVER THE AREA...
EXPECT ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ON MONDAY.
THESE STORMS SHOULD REMAIN PULSE IN NATURE...AS ATMOSPHERIC WINDS
WILL REMAIN FAIRLY WEAK. DUE TO LIMITED DEEP LAYER SHEAR AND
LEFTOVER CLOUDS FROM SUNDAY NIGHTS CONVECTION OUT WEST...THINK THAT
CHANCES FOR SEVERE WEATHER WILL REMAIN LIMITED. IF ENOUGH BREAKS IN
THE CLOUD COVER DEVELOP LATER MONDAY AFTERNOON...THEN A FEW ISOLATED
PULSE THUNDERSTORMS COULD BECOME SEVERE. THINK THIS THREAT IS FAIRLY
LIMITED AT THIS TIME AND WILL PRECLUDE ANY MENTION OF SEVERE FOR NOW.

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN ON
TUESDAY AS A WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVES OVER THE AREA. THE LOW LEVEL
AIRMASS WILL REMAIN WARM AND HUMID TO SUPPORT THIS CONVECTION.
AGAIN...IT APPEARS THAT THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE PULSE IN NATURE.
BY TUESDAY NIGHT...THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL LIFT NORTHEAST
ALLOWING FOR A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO BUILD BACK OVER THE AREA.
WITH UPPER LEVEL HEIGHT RISES AND INCREASING 850 MB TEMPERATURES...
EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO RISE INTO THE MID TO UPPER 80S...WITH HUMID
CONDITIONS UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS HAVE BACKED OFF CONSIDERABLY ON FRONTAL PASSAGE
FRIDAY NIGHT...AND KEEP THE UPPER RIDGE IN CONTROL OF THE WEATHER
PATTERN INTO NEXT WEEKEND. SINCE THIS IS A NEW MODEL TREND...WOULD
PREFER TO SEE THIS TREND CONTINUED FOR A FEW MORE DAYS BEFORE
PULLING OUT POPS FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED. AT THIS TIME WILL
KEEP 20 POPS IN FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH

MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES...LIGHT WINDS AND COOL TEMPS EXPECTED. FORECAST 
ON TRACK AND NO UPDATED PLANNED. 

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 230 PM...

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN FIRM CONTROL OF THE MIDSOUTH
WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON. THIS HAS KEPT SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY WITH
TEMPERATURES WARMING BACK INTO THE 70S. WINDS CONTINUE PRIMARILY OUT
OF THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST AND THEY HAVE OCCASIONALLY GUSTED IN
SOME AREAS. THIS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA
THROUGH FRIDAY BEFORE GRADUALLY SLIDING EAST OVER THE WEEKEND TO A
POSITION OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. WINDS SHOULD BE LIGHTER ON
FRIDAY AND THEN GRADUALLY COME AROUND TO A SOUTHEAST AND EVENTUALLY
SOUTHERLY DIRECTION BY SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE SURFACE HIGH TO OUR
EAST.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL ALSO BUILD OVER THE AREA BY FRIDAY AND
REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY. WITH DECENT HEIGHT RISES AND
INCREASED LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION...TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY
INCREASE THROUGH SUNDAY...REACHING BACK TO NEAR NORMAL VALUES ON
FRIDAY AND TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONAL LEVELS OVER THE WEEKEND.
HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND
CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND AS THE GULF OF
MEXICO OPENS BACK UP AND LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW ADVECTS HIGHER LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE NORTHWARD. WITH THE UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE IN PLACE THROUGH THE WEEKEND...EXPECT CONTINUED DRY WEATHER
THROUGH SUNDAY.

THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON AS THE
UPPER LOW NOW CENTERED ALONG THE WEST COAST EJECTS EASTWARD ACROSS
THE PLAINS AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE MIDDLE AND UPPER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. AS THIS SHORTWAVE
TROUGH MOVES EAST IT WILL HELP TO SEND A COLD FRONT ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. AT THIS POINT...MOST OF THE MODEL
GUIDANCE SHOWS THIS FRONT STALLING JUST NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH ON
MONDAY...BEFORE LIFTING BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT ON
TUESDAY. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN ADVANCE OF

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN FIRM CONTROL OF THE MIDSOUTH
WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON. THIS HAS KEPT SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY WITH
TEMPERATURES WARMING BACK INTO THE 70S. WINDS CONTINUE PRIMARILY OUT
OF THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST AND THEY HAVE OCCASIONALLY GUSTED IN
SOME AREAS. THIS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA
THROUGH FRIDAY BEFORE GRADUALLY SLIDING EAST OVER THE WEEKEND TO A
POSITION OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. WINDS SHOULD BE LIGHTER ON
FRIDAY AND THEN GRADUALLY COME AROUND TO A SOUTHEAST AND EVENTUALLY
SOUTHERLY DIRECTION BY SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE SURFACE HIGH TO OUR
EAST.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL ALSO BUILD OVER THE AREA BY FRIDAY AND
REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY. WITH DECENT HEIGHT RISES AND
INCREASED LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION...TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY
INCREASE THROUGH SUNDAY...REACHING BACK TO NEAR NORMAL VALUES ON
FRIDAY AND TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONAL LEVELS OVER THE WEEKEND.
HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND
CONTINUE TO DO SO THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND AS THE GULF OF
MEXICO OPENS BACK UP AND LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW ADVECTS HIGHER LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE NORTHWARD. WITH THE UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE IN PLACE THROUGH THE WEEKEND...EXPECT CONTINUED DRY WEATHER
THROUGH SUNDAY.

THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON AS THE
UPPER LOW NOW CENTERED ALONG THE WEST COAST EJECTS EASTWARD ACROSS
THE PLAINS AND THEN NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE MIDDLE AND UPPER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. AS THIS SHORTWAVE
TROUGH MOVES EAST IT WILL HELP TO SEND A COLD FRONT ACROSS PORTIONS
OF THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. AT THIS POINT...MOST OF THE MODEL
GUIDANCE SHOWS THIS FRONT STALLING JUST NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH ON
MONDAY...BEFORE LIFTING BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT ON
TUESDAY. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN ADVANCE OF
THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS AND MOVE EAST INTO WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT
SUNDAY NIGHT. HAVE INCLUDED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
AREAWIDE FOR MONDAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH. THE
UPPER LEVEL FLOW SHOULD BECOME MORE ZONAL ON TUESDAY...BUT WITH A

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS SITUATED OVER THE MID-SOUTH THIS MORNING
WITH A WEAK UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING EAST ACROSS THE
REGION. THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS DRY (AS NOTED FROM REGIONAL
SOUNDINGS)...SO EXPECT A VERY NICE DAY ACROSS THE AREA WITH MOST
CLOUD COVER NOW OVER OKLAHOMA BEING SUPPRESSED AS IT MOVES EAST INTO
THE DRY AIRMASS. MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WILL CONTINUE TODAY WITH
TEMPERATURES WARMING INTO THE MID TO UPPER 70S AREAWIDE. THE CURRENT

AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS IN PLACE OVER THE REGION. AN UPPER LEVEL 
DISTURBANCE THAT BROUGHT A FAIR AMOUNT OF MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS 
ACROSS THE REGION LAST NIGHT IS MOVING OFF TO THE EAST AND CARRYING 
AWAY THOSE CLOUDS WITH IT. ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE PRODUCED 
SOME THUNDERSTORMS OVER NEBRASKA LAST NIGHT NIGHT. SOME HIGH CLOUDS 
LEFT OVER FROM THESE STORMS MAY DRIFT INTO THE AREA...OTHERWISE 
LOOKS LIKE A MAINLY SUNNY DAY ON TAP. 

UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE REGION TODAY AND WILL BE THE 
SOLE WEATHER FEATURE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 850 TEMPS WILL GRADUALLY 
RISE ABOUT 2 DEGREES EACH DAY INTO SATURDAY. LOOKING AT +6 TODAY AND 
AROUND +10 ON SATURDAY. WENT SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN GUIDANCE AT 
MEMPHIS FOR TODAY BASED UPON YESTERDAYS TRENDS...NEAR GUIDANCE 
ELSEWHERE. GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK OK FOR TONIGHT AT 
MEMPHIS...SLIGHTLY BELOW ELSEWHERE WITH MOST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE 
AT JACKSON. AM CONCERNED WITH HOW MODELS ARE HANDLING DEW POINTS 
TONIGHT AND INTO FRIDAY. THINK THAT THEY MAY BE MOISTENING UP TOO 
FAST. LOOKING AT DEW POINTS ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING...DOESNT 
REALLY LOOK LIKE THE REAL DEW POINT RISE WILL BE UNTIL THE SURFACE 
HIGH BEGINS TO SHIFT JUST EAST OF THE REGION AND THAT WILL NOT BE 
UNTIL FRIDAY. AS A RESULT...THINK THAT RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL 
RESULT IN SLIGHTLY LOWER TEMPS AT THESE SITES TONIGHT. DID NOT 
CHANGE FORECAST HIGHS FOR FRIDAY. ONCE AGAIN THINK THAT IT MAY BE 
WARMER DUE TO DRIER AIR THAN THE MODELS ARE FORECASTING. BY SATURDAY 
THE SURFACE HIGH SHOULD BE JUST EAST OF THE REGION AND SO EXPECT 
THAT THE DEW POINTS BY THIS POINT WOULD BE MORE REASONABLE. GUIDANCE 
GENERALLY ACCEPTED. 

THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN STILL LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE SUNDAY NIGHT 
INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK AS THE UPPER RIDGE SHIFTS OFF TO THE EAST AND A 
STORM SYSTEM TRIES TO RIDE UP THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE RIDGE.

FORTUNATELY A DIFFERENT WEATHER SITUATION THAN TWO YEARS AGO TODAY. 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY INTO THE 
MIDSOUTH REGION. THERE IS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE OVER CENTRAL 
TEXAS THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. SATELLITE TRENDS THIS 
MORNING SHOWING SOME THIN CIRRUS FROM THIS SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA TODAY. BY THIS AFTERNOON AND AS THE SYSTEM MOVES 
CLOSER...THE HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS MAY BE NOTICEABLE ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY 
PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS OVER NORTH MS. LITTLE ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO 
TEMP FORECAST TODAY. THE UPPER TROUGH THAT HAS BEEN PREVALENT OVER 
THE EASTERN US IS CONTINUING TO RECEDE RESULT IN A GRADUAL WARMING 
TREND OVER THE MIDSOUTH. 

THE UPPER SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT WITH SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL. LOW LEVELS REMAIN VERY DRY WITH 
DEEPER MOISTURE AND BETTER DYNAMICS WELL SOUTH OF THE REGION. SO NO 
RAIN IS EXPECTED. ONLY QUESTION WILL BE RATHER THE UPPER CLOUDS WILL 
BE THICK ENOUGH FOR PARTLY VS MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT. WILL KEEP 
CURRENT FORECAST AS IT IS AND ALLOW NEXT SHIFT TACKLE IT. 

THE UPPER SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO MOVE OUT OF THE REGION ON THURSDAY 
WITH SKIES BECOMING MOSTLY SUNNY. WARMER AS WELL AS THE UPPER RIDGE 
THAT WAS OVER THE WESTERN US BUILDS INTO THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND. 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY WITH UPPER 
RIDGE OVERHEAD AND HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL. POTENTIALLY LOOKING AT 
TEMPS AROUND 80 FOR THE WEEKEND. THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN IS STILL 
EARLY NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO DISPLACE THE RIDGE.

SOUTH. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS FROST POTENTIAL 
TONIGHT...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY AND 
ALSO BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. 

A WEAK SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL WEAKEN AND MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
TONIGHT. HIGH BASED DIURNAL CU WILL BEGIN TO DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET 
JUST AS MID LEVEL CLOUDS MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA. 
DECOUPLING WINDS LACK OF CLOUDS AND CURRENT DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 
30S ACROSS THE FAR NORTHERN SECTION OF THE CWA SUPPORT A MENTION OF 
ISOLATED FROST WITH LOWS DROPPING INTO THE UPPER 30S.

ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY. 305K ISENTROPIC SURFACE SHOWS VERY WEAK 
ISENTROPIC LIFT PASSING JUST TO THE SOUTH ACROSS CENTRAL/SOUTHERN 
MISSISSIPPI AND THINK FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN DRY. UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING WILL BUILD IN ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THURSDAY 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH THE NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION. CURRENT 
THINKING IS THAT FRONT MAY GET HUNG UP JUST TO THE WEST OF THE AREA 
AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING MOVES SLIGHTLY EAST WITH THE MID SOUTH 
REMAINING IN SOUTHWEST FLOW. BOTH GFS AND EUROPEAN SOLUTIONS SUPPORT 
THIS THINKING WHILE DGEX STALLS FRONT OUT ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AND

ZONAL FLOW OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE U.S. WILL KEEP THINGS 
INTERESTING FOR THE MID SOUTH BEGINNING EARLY THIS WEEK. THE UPPER 
LOW OVER SOUTHEASTERN CANADA WILL GRADUALLY MOVE NORTHEAST. 
DISTURBANCES WILL ROTATE AROUND THE UPPER LOW AND ASSIST IN KEEPING

HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE REGION PROVIDING THE 
COOLER...DRIER AIR. 

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE THAT WILL STREAM OVER 
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TODAY AND TONIGHT. AN INCREASE IN LOW TO MID 
LEVEL CLOUDS WILL LIKELY OCCUR TONIGHT AS WELL. MODELS DIFFER ON 
RAIN CHANCES BUT STILL FEEL THAT MONDAY AFTERNOON WILL BE THE START 
OF A STRETCH OF WET WEATHER. WE WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH DISTURBANCES 
MOVING OUT OF OKLAHOMA AND LATER...EAST TEXAS. 

THERE IS A SHORTWAVE THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT BASIN MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TRANSLATES ACROSS TEXAS WEDNESDAY. AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE A 
DEEPENING SURFACE LOW IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE LA GULF COAST. 
THIS SCENARIO WOULD PUMP IN DECENT MOISTURE FOR THE APPROACHING

.DISCUSSION...
VERY IMPRESSIVE WEATHER PATTERN HAS SET UP ACROSS THE U.S. THE 
ATMOSPHERE OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY IS VERY UNSTABLE. 
THE MAIN FOCUS THIS FORECAST PERIOD WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE 
WEATHER THAT WILL LIKELY DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND CONTINUE INTO 
THE EVENING.

A DEEP SURFACE LOW LOCATED OVER CENTRAL TEXAS WILL MIGRATE NORTHEAST 
TODAY AHEAD OF A SHORTWAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS THE TEXAS 
PANHANDLE. LOW LEVEL SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL INCREASE THROUGH THE DAY 
TRANSPORTING MOISTURE RICH AIR INTO THE MID SOUTH. BY EARLY 
EVENING...THESE SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL REACH CLOSE TO 50 KNOTS. 

AS THE SURFACE LOW MOVES INTO THE MID SOUTH...THE SEVERE WEATHER 
POTENTIAL WILL INCREASE RAPIDLY PRIMARILY FOR AREAS ALONG AND SOUTH 
OF I-40. IT APPEARS THAT SEVERE STORMS COULD DEVELOP AS EARLY AS 
NOON AND CONTINUE INTO THE LATE EVENING HOURS. SHEAR PROFILES 
INDICATE SURFACE WINDS TO BE SOUTHERLY AND POSSIBLY A LITTLE EAST OF 
SOUTH WHICH WOULD PROVIDE GOOD INFLOW INTO STORMS THAT DEVELOP. 
ALSO...THE STORMS THAT DEVELOP WILL MOVE QUICKLY EASTWARD HOWEVER 
SEVERAL STORMS MAY MOVE OVER THE SAME AREAS...ESPECIALLY OVER 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. THEREFORE THERE WILL BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN I.E. 2+ INCHES... TO OCCUR FOR SOME AREAS.

THIS EVENING...THE SURFACE LOW WILL TRACK OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. 
BEHIND THE LOW...SURFACE WINDS WILL BE NORTHERLY AND GUSTY. 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT EAST OVERNIGHT. PERHAPS SOME RAIN 
WILL STILL BE OCCURRING OVER NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI AND AREAS OF WE 
TENNESSEE CLOSE TO THE TN RIVER BY SATURDAY MORNING. EXPECT ALL THE 
RAIN TO SHIFT EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
DRY...COOL CONDITIONS ARE ANTICIPATED FOR SUNDAY AS SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION.

CURRENT BOUNDARY EXTENDING FROM NORTH TEXAS THROUGH EASTERN OKLAHOMA
INTO SOUTHERN MISSOURI. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE
TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. CLOUD COVER OVER THE
REGION HAS KEPT TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S TO NEAR 60 IN MOST LOCATIONS
WHILE TO OUR SOUTH...TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED INTO THE LOW TO MID
80S WHERE THERE HAS BEEN SUNSHINE MOST OF THE DAY. FRONTAL BOUNDARY
SHOULD NOT MOVE MUCH TONIGHT BUT EXPECT SURFACE LOW TO RIDE ALONG
BOUNDARY LATER TONIGHT. THIS SHOULD HELP SPARK SOME SCATTERED
CONVECTION MAINLY OVER OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES. SPC DOES HAVE MOST OF
FORECAST AREA IN A SLIGHT RISK FOR TONIGHT BUT RISK DOES NOT APPEAR
ENOUGH TO WARRANT MENTIONING IN ZONES.

MEANWHILE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL MOVE OUT OF SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA
TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. AS IT APPROACHES THE REGION FRIDAY IT WILL HELP
PUSH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH OUR AREA. THIS WILL MEAN MORE
THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. SPC DOES HAVE MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA IN A MODERATE RISK. BIGGEST QUESTION IS MOISTURE
AVAILABILITY. CURRENT DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE MID 40S TO NEAR 50.
WINDS HAVE STARTED TO INCREASE TO OUR SOUTH AND THAT MAY HELP PUSH
GULF MOISTURE INTO THE REGION BEFORE THE COLD FRONT GETS HERE. HAVE
INCLUDED MENTION OF SEVERE STORMS FOR BOTH FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.
COLD FRONT SHOULD BE OUT OF THE REGION BY SATURDAY MORNING SO HAVE
KEPT DRY FORECAST FOR SATURDAY. DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THROUGH

THUNDERSTORMS APPROACHING THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
NUMEROUS CONCERNS IN THIS FORECAST PACKAGE WITH SEVERE WEATHER 
POTENTIAL TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. 00Z NAM/GFS IN DECENT OVERALL 
AGREEMENT AT LEAST THROUGH SATURDAY. 

.TODAY...WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH TODAY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
MODELS SUGGESTING WARM FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE ENTIRE FORECAST 
AREA BY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. 40 KT LOW LEVEL JET WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE WEAKENING BY LATE AFTERNOON AS WARM FRONT 
STALLS OUT ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND RED RIVER VALLEY. 
UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS LOOK WEAK AS THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE 
NEAR THE RIGHT EXIT REGION OF THE UPPER LEVEL JET. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
PRODUCE 700 J/KG OF SURFACE BASED CAPE...LI/S BETWEEN -4 TO -6...AND 
STEEP 700-500 MB MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AROUND 7.5 C/KM. MADE 
SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS TO MORNING POPS BASED UPON CURRENT TRENDS. 
ANY THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS DURING THE DAY. 
OTHER PROBLEM OF THE DAY IS WIND ADVISORY POTENTIAL ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN TIER OR TWO OF COUNTIES ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. WINDS 
ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AFTER WARM 
FRONTAL PASSAGE. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW 20+ KT SUSTAINED WINDS ACROSS 
THE ABOVE MENTIONED AREA WITH GUSTS AROUND 30 KTS BY THIS AFTERNOON. 
HOWEVER...CURRENTLY THINK THAT WINDS MAY STAY BELOW ADVISORY 
CRITERIA AS CLOUD COVER LIMITING MIXING INTO BOUNDARY LAYER. DAY 
SHIFT WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT SITUATION AS 12Z DATA STARTS COMING 
IN.  

TONIGHT...SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE ACROSS NW ARKANSAS WITH WARM FRONT 
EXTENDING ACROSS MO/AR/KY BORDER. THIS WARM FRONT WILL BECOME 
STATIONARY OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AS A 
SECONDARY LOW FORMS OVER THE RED RIVER VALLEY. MODEL ANALYSIS THIS 
MORNING SUGGESTS THAT A BACKWARD PROPAGATING MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE 
SYSTEM MAY FORM UPSTREAM TONIGHT ACROSS THE RED RIVER VALLEY AND 
MOVE ALONG THE STATIONARY FRONT TONIGHT. HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL IS NOT 
OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH K-INDICIES INCREASING TO AROUND 36 ALONG 
THE BOUNDARY AND WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES NEAR 1.5 INCHES.

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...STRONG AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL DEVELOP 
IN THE RED RIVER VALLEY AND BEGIN TO MOVE UP THE STATIONARY 
BOUNDARY...MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. SEVERAL 
CONVECTIVE PARAMETERS SUPPORT SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL...ESPECIALLY 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND FRIDAY NIGHT. SURFACE BASED CAPES WILL INCREASE 
TO 2000+ J/KG...0-6KM BULK SHEAR VALUES EXCEEDING 60 KTS...LI/S NEAR 
-9...AND 0-1KM HELICITY VALUES AT LEAST 200 M2/S2. STRONG WIND 
FIELDS ALOFT AND DECENT 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS ARE INDICATIVE 
OF A DAMAGING WIND THREAT. CONVECTION SHOULD START OFF AS DISCRETE 
CELLS THAT WILL EVENTUALLY FORM INTO A SQUALL LINE...PRODUCING 
HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS AND TORNADOES. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
COME TO AN END ACROSS MOST AREAS AFTER MIDNIGHT WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING IN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH ON SATURDAY.

NO CHANGES MADE TO LATER PERIODS.

HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON. A 
STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDS FROM ALONG THE CENTRAL GULF COAST THROUGH 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER COLORADO. 
ATMOSPHERE IS RATHER DRY WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 30S TODAY. QUICK 
CHANGES ARE EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS WITH A SIGNIFICANT STORM 
SYSTEM EXPECTED TO MOTOR THOUGH THE REGION ON FRIDAY.

TONIGHT...THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO OKLAHOMA TONIGHT 
WITH THE STATIONARY FRONT RISING NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT. BY 12Z 
THE WARM FRONT WILL BE FROM NORTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS TO NEAR PINE 
BLUFF TO NEAR GREENWOOD MS. BETTER LIFT SHOULD REMAIN WEST OF THE 
REGION AND SINCE THE ATMOSPHERE IS SO DRY...NOT EXPECTING ANY RAIN 
TONIGHT. ON THURSDAY THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND BE WEAKENING THROUGH THIS TIME. WITH THE 
SYSTEM WEAKENING AND MOISTURE STILL LIMITED EXPECT ONLY LOW CHANCES 
OF RAIN AND MAINLY ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND NORTHWEST TN WHERE 
THE DYNAMICS ARE BETTER. A WIND ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED FROM THE TN 
BORDER SOUTH TOMORROW AFTERNOON AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS. 
SUSTAINED WINDS OF NEAR 20MPH WITH WIND GUSTS UP TO 35 TO 40 MPH 
POSSIBLE. 

THE LOW WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT AND THIS WILL 
LAY A STALLED FRONT OUT FROM SOUTHEAST MO THROUGH CENTRAL ARKANSAS 
AND BACK INTO A POTENT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER TEXAS. MOISTURE WILL 
BE INCREASING DURING THIS TIME WITH SFC DPS INTO THE 50S. BUT LIFT 
IS STILL MARGINAL SO CONFIDENCE IN RAIN STILL LOW AND STILL ACROSS 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS INTO WEST TN. 

FRIDAY...GOOD CHANCES FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS. THE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH ARKANSAS AND INTO SOUTHEAST MO BY 00Z. 
MODELS SHOWING SFC DPS RISING INTO THE 60S. STRONG DYNAMICS WITH 
THIS SYSTEM. 850MB WINDS OF 50 TO 60KTS ARE PROBABLE...0-3KM 
HELICITY OF AROUND 250 M2/S2 ARE POSSIBLE. MOST OF THIS HELICITY 
WILL BE DUE TO WIND SPEED WITH SURFACE WINDS OUT OF THE SOUTH OR 
SOUTHWEST. INSTABILITY PARAMETERS ARE AROUND -5 LI AND 2000-2500 
J/KG CAPE. HAVE GOOD CONFIDENCE IN SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS THE REGION 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND FRIDAY EVENING. THE ONLY LIMITING FACTOR COULD 
BE MOISTURE RETURN AND UNLESS THERE IS A DRASTIC CHANGE IN THE TRACK 
OF THE SURFACE LOW. THE RUNS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT AND IF THIS 
SCENARIO COMES TO LIFE...THE QUESTION WILL BE A SQUALL LINE OF 
MULTICELLULAR STORMS VS A LINE OF SUPERCELLS. SO...LARGE HAIL IS 
POSSIBLE ALONG WITH DAMAGING WINDS. IF SUPERCELLS DEVELOP...THEN 
TORNADOES ARE POSSIBLE. 

THE FRONT CLEARS THE REGION PROBABLY BY 06Z OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER. 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THE NEXT FRONT 
ARRIVING EARLY NEXT WEEK AND STALLING OVER THE REGION. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN UNSETTLED WEATHER FOR THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK.

HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED OVER OKLAHOMA THIS MORNING. NORTHWEST FLOW 
IS OVER THE REGION. A CU FIELD HAS BEGUN TO DEVELOP THIS MORNING 
NORTH OF A LINE ROUGHLY FROM JONESBORO TO MEMPHIS TO TUPELO. EXPECT 
THAT CU WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THIS LINE WITH MAINLY SUNNY SKIES 
SOUTHWARD. HAVE LOWERED MAX TEMPS INTO THE 60S FOR THIS AFTERNOON. 
HAD GOOD COOLING AT 850 MB LOWERING TEMPS TO AROUND +2. EXPECT TEMPS 
TO GRADUALLY LEVEL OFF THIS AFTERNOON. 850 TEMPS WILL REBOUND TO +5 
AFTER 21Z BUT THE BETTER HEATING WILL BE FINISHED BY THEN.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
355 AM CDT WED APR 27 2005

.DISCUSSION...LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY AND OBSERVATIONS 
SHOW SOME MID LEVEL CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY THIS MORNING. SHOWER ACTIVITY FROM LAST NIGHT HAS MOVED EAST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA AS 500 MB TROUGH IS LOCATED ACROSS CENTRAL 
TENNESSEE. MAIN CONCERNS THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE 
POTENTIAL TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AND WIND ADVISORY POTENTIAL 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

.TODAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MID SOUTH TODAY WITH WEAK 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING. SKIES WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY AS SOME LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE HANGS AROUND NEAR 850 MB DURING THE DAY WITH HIGHS IN 
THE MID 60S TO AROUND 70. 

.TONIGHT...SURFACE/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL GRADUALLY BEGIN TO 
MOVE EAST TONIGHT AS NEXT SURFACE LOW FORMS OVER THE ROCKIES 
AND MOVES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. WARM FRONT EXTENDING FROM THE 
LOW OVER TEXAS WILL MOVE NORTH DURING THE NIGHT AND EXPECTING CLOUDS 
TO INCREASE AS MID/UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE BEGINS TO RETURN OVERNIGHT. 
LATEST MODEL TRENDS SHOW MOISTURE RETURN OCCURRING AS EARLY AS 9Z 
THURSDAY. SO WILL ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS TO 
FORECAST AFTER MIDNIGHT BUT MAINLY TOWARDS DAYBREAK.    

.THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...WARM FRONT WILL MOVE AS FAR NORTH AS 
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI/OHIO VALLEY BEFORE STALLING OUT UNTIL SURFACE LOW 
SWINGS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. 700-500 MB MID LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES WILL STEEPEN TO AROUND AN IMPRESSIVE 7.5 TO 8.0 C/KM 
ACROSS THE OZARKS AND A PORTION OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WITH LI/S 
APPROACHING -8 AND MLCAPES AROUND 800 J/KG EXTENDING THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT. BEST CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRIMARILY 
BE NEAR THE FRONT ACROSS THE NW THIRD OF FORECAST AREA WITH HAIL AND 
DAMAGING WIND GUSTS AS SEVERE WEATHER THREATS. OTHER CONCERN IS WIND 
POTENTIAL DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY AS 850 MB LOW LEVEL JET MOVES 
OVERHEAD. MODEL CONSENSUS SUGGESTS SUSTAINED WINDS MAY BE AROUND 20 
KTS WITH A FEW GUSTS APPROACHING 35 TO 40 KTS. LATER SHIFTS WILL 
MONITOR TRENDS FOR POTENTIAL WIND ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON.  

.FRIDAY...A STRONG LOW WILL EJECT OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND 
INTO THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS ON FRIDAY NIGHT. EVEN 
WITH SOME MINOR DIFFERENCES...NAM/GFS IN AGREEMENT WITH POTENTIAL 
FOR CONVECTION. 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES ARE EXPECTED TO BE AT 
LEAST 7 C/KM WITH DECENT MID-LEVEL DYNAMICAL FORCING /Q-VECTOR 
CONVERGENCE/. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE AT LEAST 1500-2000 J/KG 
SURFACE BASED CAPE AVAILABLE...LI/S AROUND -6...AND 0-6KM BULK SHEAR 
VALUES AROUND 60 KTS. WIND PROFILES SUGGEST DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE WITH THIS SYSTEM WITH 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS AT LEAST 
5C. THREAT FOR TORNADOES NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION WITH 0-1KM STORM 
RELATIVE HELICITIES ESTIMATED AROUND 200 M2/S2. THAT SAID...THE 
SEVERE WEATHER THREATS EXPECTED BASED ON CURRENT DATA WOULD BE 
DAMAGING WINDS...HAIL...AND TORNADOES. CURRENT HAZARDOUS WEATHER 
OUTLOOK HANDLING MENTION OF SEVERE POTENTIAL WELL AND WILL NOT MAKE 
ANY CHANGES TO WORDING AT THIS TIME. REMOVED POPS FROM SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AS BOTH NAM/GFS TRENDING FASTER WITH PROGRESSION OF THIS 
SYSTEM.

NO CHANGES MADE BEYOND SATURDAY.

ROUNDING THE BASE OF THE TROUGH. EXTRAPOLATION OF CURRENT MOVEMENT
WOULD HAVE IT DEPARTING THE CWA RIGHT AROUND 05Z. ISOLATED SHOWERS
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THE AREA AROUND THE

LONGWAVE TROUGH EXTENDS FROM THE LOW ACROSS THE MISSOURI VALLEY AND

.TODAY...COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS WILL 
PASS THROUGH THE MID SOUTH TODAY WITH ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT 
REMAINING ACROSS CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES

MISSISSIPPI WITH HAIL AND POSSIBLY WIND AS THE THREATS. SKIES WILL 
BE MOSTLY/CLOUDY TODAY WITH SKIES BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY TEMPORARILY 
BY LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING AS DRY SLOT MOVES OVERHEAD. HIGHS

FAIRLY QUIET ACRS THE AREA AS HIGH PRESSURE RETREATS AND THE NEXT 
SYSTEM STARTS TO MOVE IN. MANAGED TO SALVAGE A PRETTY NICE DAY WITH 
SOME SUN AND MILD TEMPS. THINGS CHANGES TONIGHT AS A MAJOR TROF DIGS 
INTO THE CNTRL U.S. AND A COLD FRONT APPROACHES LATER TONIGHT. THE 
PRECIP CURRENTLY WORKING INTO WRN AR WL TAKE A WHILE TO REACH THE 
MID SOUTH AS DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE NEEDS SOME TIME TO MOISTEN. AS A 
RESULT EXPECT A MOSTLY DRY EVENING...ESPECIALLY EAST OF THE RIVER.

BEST COMBINATION OF LIFT AND DEEPER MOISTURE WL BE IN PLACE ACRS THE 
REGION AFTER 06Z. GFS AND ETA ARE IN SOME DISAGREEMENT WITH RESPECT 
TO QPF AMOUNTS FROM 06Z-12Z TUE. CONVECTION ALONG THE GULF COAST MAY 
KEEP AMOUNTS DOWN ACRS THE AREA ACCORDING TO THE GFS. BY 12Z COLD 
FRONT WL BE MOVING INTO ERN AR. SEVERE WEATHER IS QUESTIONABLE ATTM 
AND HINGES ON HOW FAR NORTH THE WARM FRONT PROGRESSES TUE MORNING. 
RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS TO MAKE IT INTO NORTH MS. AS A RESULT THERE IS 
A SMALL CHC OF SEVERE WX ACRS THIS AREA ON TUE....PROBABLY BEFORE 
NOON TUE. THE FRONT WL RACE EAST INTO MID TN AND AL BY EARLY AFTN. 
EXPECT SOME CLEARING BEHIND THE FRONT DURING THE AFTN.

SOME CLOUDS WL PROBABLY LINGER ACRS NRN SXNS AS UPPER TROF SWINGS 
THRU TUE EVENING WITH PERHAPS SOME SPRINKLES. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN FOR WED.

AS HIGH PRESSURE RETREATS ON THU A WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH THROUGH 
THE REGION AND STALLS JUST NORTH OF THE AREA. THIS FRONT WL BECOME 
THE FOCUS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK INTO PART OF THE WEEKEND. 
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WL KEEP THIS FEATURE NEAR THE AREA WITH A SERIES OF 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS EXPECTED TO MOVE ALONG THE FRONT. A STRONGER 
SHORTWAVE KICKS THE FRONT THROUGH SAT NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WL THEN

.UPDATE...
LOOKS LIKE WE WILL MANAGE ONE MORE DECENT DAY BEFORE THE WET WEATHER 
SETTLES IN TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. CLOUDS ON THE INCREASE FROM THE WEST 
THIS AFTN...THOUGH THERE ARE PLENTY OF BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS STILL 
PRESENT ACRS MUCH OF MID SOUTH AND ACRS AR ATTM. THERE WILL BE A MIX 
OF SUN AND CLOUDS THIS AFTN WITH TEMPS WARMING INTO THE UPPER 60S TO 
AROUND 70. BEST LIFT AND DEEPER MOISTURE STILL WELL TO THE WEST THIS 
MORNING. WITH DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE ACRS THE REGION IT WILL TAKE A 
WHILE TO MOISTEN UP. THERE MAY BE A FEW SPRINKLES LATER THIS AFTN 
BUT WILL CONFINE THE 20 POP TO NE AR FOR THE REST OF TODAY.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 344 AM...
LATEST MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH OUR CURRENT FORECAST SO NOT
MUCH CHANGE IS NEEDED THIS MORNING. RIDGE TO OUR WEST IS BREAKING
DOWN THIS MORNING ALLOWING THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW TO BECOME MORE
WESTERLY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. AS A RESULT...MID AND HIGH LEVEL
CLOUDS ARE QUICKLY SPREADING INTO THE MIDSOUTH. AN UPPER LEVEL
SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS TODAY. SURFACE WINDS WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH TODAY
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH RESULTING IN WARMER TEMPERATURES AND INCREASING
SURFACE DEWPOINTS. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE. THIS WILL LEAD TO A SLIGHT
CHANCE OF RAIN THIS AFTERNOON FROM ABOUT THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL TO
TUPELO...AND SOUTHWESTWARD.

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IN THE NORTHERN STREAM
WILL APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT WHILE THE SOUTHERN SHORT WAVE
WEAKENS AND MOVES TO THE EAST. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE
INTO EAST ARKANSAS FROM THE WEST BY 12Z WHILE A WARM FRONT PUSHES
TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE SOUTH. 850 MB FLOW INCREASES TO 50
KNOTS FROM THE SOUTHWEST BY 12Z ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH.
GREATEST INSTABILITY REMAINS TO THE SOUTH OF THE MIDSOUTH...AND SPC
HAS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE TO OUR SOUTH TONIGHT. COULD BE A FEW
STRONG THUNDERSTORMS LATE TONIGHT FROM ABOUT MARVELL AR IN PHILLIPS
COUNTY TO AMORY MS IN MONROE COUNTY. MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL
COMBINE WITH STRONG WIND SHEAR THROUGH THIS AREA BY LATE TONIGHT
AS THE WARM FRONT NEARS.

THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH EASTWARD THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY.
THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PHILLIPS
COUNTY AR ACROSS MOST OF NORTH MS. THE WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE
TO PUSH NORTHWARD INTO NORTH MS DURING THE MORNING. ONCE AGAIN
INSTABILITY WILL BE QUESTIONABLE...DEPENDING ON HOW FAR NORTH THE
WARM FRONT GETS.

DRY AND COOLER WEATHER WILL PUSH INTO THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT...
BUT WEDNESDAY WILL SEE A QUICK WARM UP AS WINDS TURN TO AND
INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST. THE MESOETA IS INDICATING THERE COULD
BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FROM NORTHEAST AR INTO NORTHWEST TN LATE
WEDNESDAY / WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS A SURFACE BOUNDARY SETS UP JUST TO
OUR NORTH. THE GFS IS NOT AGREEMENT WITH THIS. ATTM...WILL LEAVE
THE FORECAST DRY UNTIL MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT. NO CHANGES TO THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST.

344 AM CDT MON APR 25 2005

.DISCUSSION...
LATEST MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH OUR CURRENT FORECAST SO NOT
MUCH CHANGE IS NEEDED THIS MORNING. RIDGE TO OUR WEST IS BREAKING
DOWN THIS MORNING ALLOWING THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW TO BECOME MORE
WESTERLY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. AS A RESULT...MID AND HIGH LEVEL
CLOUDS ARE QUICKLY SPREADING INTO THE MIDSOUTH. AN UPPER LEVEL
SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS TODAY. SURFACE WINDS WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH TODAY
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH RESULTING IN WARMER TEMPERATURES AND INCREASING
SURFACE DEWPOINTS. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE. THIS WILL LEAD TO A SLIGHT
CHANCE OF RAIN THIS AFTERNOON FROM ABOUT THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL TO
TUPELO...AND SOUTHWESTWARD.

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IN THE NORTHERN STREAM
WILL APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT WHILE THE SOUTHERN SHORT WAVE
WEAKENS AND MOVES TO THE EAST. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE
INTO EAST ARKANSAS FROM THE WEST BY 12Z WHILE A WARM FRONT PUSHES
TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE SOUTH. 850 MB FLOW INCREASES TO 50
KNOTS FROM THE SOUTHWEST BY 12Z ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH.
GREATEST INSTABILITY REMAINS TO THE SOUTH OF THE MIDSOUTH...AND SPC
HAS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE TO OUR SOUTH TONIGHT. COULD BE A FEW
STRONG THUNDERSTORMS LATE TONIGHT FROM ABOUT MARVELL AR IN PHILLIPS
COUNTY TO AMORY MS IN MONROE COUNTY. MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL
COMBINE WITH STRONG WIND SHEAR THROUGH THIS AREA BY LATE TONIGHT
AS THE WARM FRONT NEARS.

THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH EASTWARD THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY.
THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FROM PHILLIPS
COUNTY AR ACROSS MOST OF NORTH MS. THE WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE
TO PUSH NORTHWARD INTO NORTH MS DURING THE MORNING. ONCE AGAIN
INSTABILITY WILL BE QUESTIONABLE...DEPENDING ON HOW FAR NORTH THE
WARM FRONT GETS.

DRY AND COOLER WEATHER WILL PUSH INTO THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT...
BUT WEDNESDAY WILL SEE A QUICK WARM UP AS WINDS TURN TO AND
INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST. THE MESOETA IS INDICATING THERE COULD
BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FROM NORTHEAST AR INTO NORTHWEST TN LATE
WEDNESDAY / WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS A SURFACE BOUNDARY SETS UP JUST TO
OUR NORTH. THE GFS IS NOT AGREEMENT WITH THIS. ATTM...WILL LEAVE
THE FORECAST DRY UNTIL MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT. NO CHANGES TO THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST.

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN CONTROL OF THE WEATHER TONIGHT. 
SKIES WILL REMAIN CLEAR TO MOSTLY CLEAR DURING THE EVENING. DON/T 
EXPECT LOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP AS MUCH AS LAST NIGHT. LOWS SHOULD 
BE INTO THE MID 30S TO MID 40S ACROSS THE AREA. EXPECT MID TO HIGH 
CLOUDS TO BEGIN TO MOVE INTO SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH 
AFTER MIDNIGHT AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT IS CURRENTLY 
LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES. 

CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE ON MONDAY AND BY AFTERNOON EXPECT 
SHOWERS TO MOVE INTO SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF CWA AS A WARM FRONT BEGINS 
TO LIFT NORTHWARD.

WARM FRONT SHOULD LIFT INTO NORTH MISSISSIPPI MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
EARLY TUESDAY. THE FRONT WILL BE THE FOCUS OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. SOME OF THE THUNDERSTORMS COULD BE SEVERE 
DURING THIS TIME. THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE STORMS FOR 
PORTIONS OF EASTERN ARKANSAS AND NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI DURING THIS 
TIME.

THE SEVERE THREAT WILL SHIFT TO NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI ON TUESDAY AS 
THE WARM FRONT PUSHES EAST AND A COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO THE CWA. 
COLD FRONT WILL LINGER IN EXTREME EASTERN ZONES TUESDAY EVENING 
BEFORE EXITING AREA.

MIDSOUTH WILL SEE A BRIEF BREAK FROM PRECIPITATION CHANCES AS HIGH 
PRESSURE REBUILDS INTO THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY. BREAK WILL BE 
SHORT-LIVED AS ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE REGION ON 
THURSDAY AND WILL BRING THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO 
THE AREA THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

CLOUDS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE UPPER LOW ARE STILL SLOW TO MOVE OUT 
OF THE CWA THIS AFTERNOON. EXPECT THE CLOUDS TO REMAIN DURING THE 
EVENING OVER THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES...WHILE THE REST OF THE CWA 
CLEARS OUT. AFTER MIDNIGHT...THE ENTIRE AREA SHOULD BE CLEAR AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA. WINDS WILL ALSO STAY UP DURING THE

DEGREES THAN WHAT THE PREVIOUS FORECAST HAD GOING. EVEN WITH RAISING 
THE TEMPERATURES...AREAS WEST TENNESSEE WILL DROP NEAR OR BELOW

NORTHEAST OF A LINE FROM DYERSBURG TO SELMER. WILL ALSO KEEP MENTION 
OF SCATTERED FROST ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...MO 
BOOTHEEL...PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE...AND NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL STAY IN CONTROL FOR SUNDAY AND WILL GIVE THE 
MIDSOUTH A PLEASANT DAY WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. TEMPERATURES WILL 
STILL BE ON THE COOL SIDE WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S.

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE BY MONDAY AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
APPROACHES THE AREA FROM THE SOUTHWEST. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS

H5 FLOW THIS MORNING SHOWS A STRONG WIND FLOW FROM CENTRAL CANADA TO
THE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL STEER COLD HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE NORTHERN
PLAINS INTO THE MIDSOUTH THIS WEEKEND. LATEST SATELLITE SHOWS
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. HOWEVER...LOW CLOUDS ARE
UPSTREAM OVER MO. THINK CLOUDS WILL SPREAD INTO OR DEVELOP ACROSS
MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS MORNING. THERE HAS BEEN SOME LIGHT RAIN
OVER MO ASSOCIATED WITH THESE CLOUDS. WILL MENTION A CHANCE
OF SPRINKLES FOR THIS MORNING FROM THE MO BOOTHEEL INTO MUCH OF WEST
TN AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE ROTATES AROUND A LARGE H5 LOW
CENTERED OVER THE OH RIVER VALLEY. WINDS WILL BE STRONG AND GUSTY
TODAY FROM THE NORTHWEST...BUT ATTM...THINK THEY WILL REMAIN BELOW
WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA.

FOR TONIGHT...WILL LEAVE FREEZE WATCH AS IS WHICH INCLUDES THE AREA
FROM THE MO BOOTHEEL...ACROSS MUCH OF WEST TN (EXCLUDING THE MEMPHIS
METRO AREA)...AND INTO EXTREME NORTHEAST MS. NAM 850 MB FORECAST
SHOWS MINUS 4 DEGREES C SPREADING INTO MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH WITH
MINUS 6 DEGREES C OVER EXTREME NORTHERN REACHES OF WEST TN. WILL ALSO
KEEP IN SCATTERED FROST FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA EXCEPT FOR
SOUTHWESTERN AREAS...ALTHOUGH WINDS MAY STAY UP HIGH ENOUGH TO KEEP
MUCH FROST FROM FORMING EXCEPT IN WIND PROTECTED LOCATIONS. RH PROGS
INDICATE SKIES WILL BE CLEAR TONIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE THAT WAY
THROUGH SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN UNSEASONABLY COOL SUNDAY.

WILL ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON ALONG AND
SOUTHWEST OF A JONESBORO TO MEMPHIS TO TUPELO LINE. NAM AND GFS
ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS MONDAY WITH A STRONG SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING OVR TX. A
WARM FRONT WILL DEVELOP TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE MIDSOUTH. ISENTROPIC
LIFT WILL SPREAD CLOUDS AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN INTO THE AREA
FROM THE SOUTHWEST. A BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS...AND POSSIBLY
THUNDERSTORMS...WILL COME MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS THE UPPER
LEVEL LOW AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW MOVES ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH FROM
THE WEST. SPC INDICATES A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE MONDAY NIGHT FOR
PART OF EAST-CENTRAL AR INTO NORTH MS. HOWEVER...THE LATEST NAM
KEEPS THE MORE UNSTABLE AIR FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS. ATTM...WILL

COLD FRONT CURRENTLY RUNNING FROM JUST NORTHWEST OF ST. LOUIS TO

EXTENDS FROM SOUTHERN ILLINOIS THROUGH WESTERN ARKANSAS AND HAS
SHOWN A WEAKENING TREND. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE CURRENT

FIRE UP LATE THIS MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON. SPC HAS EASTERN
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA IN A MODERATE RISK SO HAVE PUT SEVERE
WORDING IN THOSE AREAS. COLD FRONT SHOULD BE MOSTLY OUT OF THE

THUNDERSTORMS AFTER 00Z. MUCH COOLER AIR BEGINS TO MOVE IN BEHIND
THE FRONT TONIGHT WITH MOST LOCATIONS SEEING TEMPERATURES BELOW 50
DEGREES BY SATURDAY MORNING. COLD ADVECTION WILL BE CONTINUING
THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY AS TEMPERATURES STRUGGLE TO GET ABOVE 60

THE MIDSOUTH IS EXPERIENCING PLEASANT WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON. SKIES 
ARE MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY. DRY CONDITIONS WILL BE COMING TO 
AN END BY FRIDAY MORNING. A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA 
LATE TONIGHT. A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT. THE LINE SHOULD BEGIN ENTERING NORTHWESTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE CWA AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE LINE IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING 
AND IS EXPECTED TO BE SEVERE ACROSS MUCH OF MISSOURI...NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS...SOUTHEAST KANSAS...AND NORTHWEST OKLAHOMA. BY THE TIME THE LINE 
REACHES THE MIDSOUTH IT SHOULD BE IN A DYING PHASE. HOWEVER...THERE 
IS A CHANCE THAT SOME OF THE STORMS COULD BE SEVERE WITH LARGE HAIL 
AND DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE MAIN THREAT. SPC HAS THE MISSOURI 
BOOTHEEL AND NORTHEAST ARKANSAS IN A SLIGHT RISK. IN ADDITION...SOME 
EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD OCCUR AS A SHORTWAVE MOVES 
THROUGH THE CWA AHEAD OF THE FRONT. HOWEVER...ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT 
OCCUR WILL STAY BELOW SEVERE LIMITS DURING THE EVENING HOURS.

FRIDAY MORNING...FRONT WILL BE LOCATED NEAR NORTHWESTERN SECTIONS OF 
THE CWA. INITIAL LINE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LOCATED OVER 
EASTERN SECTIONS OF CWA. LINE SHOULD EXIT MIDSOUTH BY MIDDAY. AS THE 
DAY PROGRESSES...COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVING EASTWARD INTO THE 
REST OF THE CWA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO REDEVELOP 
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE VERY UNSTABLE OUT 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH CAPES NEAR 3000 J/KG. THE AREA WILL ALSO BE 
IN A FAVORABLE REGION OF THE UPPER LEVEL JET. SOME OF THE 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF BECOMING SEVERE. 
THERE IS A MODERATE RISK FOR MAINLY AREAS EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER.  LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS...AND POSSIBLY A FEW ISOLATED 
TORNADOES ARE POSSIBLE. FRONT MAY LINGER INTO FRIDAY EVENING ALONG 
WITH THE THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER.

BY SATURDAY MORNING...COOLER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE MIDSOUTH. COOL AND DRY WEATHER WILL 
CONTINUE INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. LOW TEMPERATURES MAY REACH FREEZING 
SUNDAY MORNING...MAINLY ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHWEST TENNESSEE.

SEVERAL COLD FRONTS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THIS WILL BRING CHANCES FOR RAIN BACK TO THE

A LONG LIVED MCS WAS MOVING SOUTHEAST THROUGH CENTRAL MISSOURI THIS 
AFTERNOON. THIS COMPLEX HAS BEEN HANDLED WELL BY THE NAM. EXPECT 
REMNANTS OF THIS COMPLEX TO AFFECT PARTS OF THE MID SOUTH THIS 
EVENING AND TONIGHT ESPECIALLY THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. A FEW SHOWERS POPPED UP NEAR THE TN RIVER THIS AFTERNOON...
HOWEVER LIFE CYCLE WAS RATHER SHORT. SURFACE DEW POINTS SURGED FROM 
THE LOWER 50S AT 8 AM TO LOWER 60S BY NOON TODAY. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
ALSO EVIDENT AROUND 5KFT WHERE SCT-BKN CU FIELD COVERS THE WHOLE 
REGION. 

THE HIGH DEW POINTS COMBINED WITH STEEPENING LAPSE RATES SHOULD 
ALLOW ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT PERSIST WITH THE MCS IN MISSOURI TO 
MOVE THROUGH PARTS OF THE MID SOUTH OVERNIGHT. SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL 
CONTINUE TO KEEP THINGS MOIST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY.  
THE REAL PROBLEMS WILL BE THE LIFTING MECHANISM AND THE CAP. MOSTLY 
CLOUDY CONDITIONS SHOULD HINDER STORM DEVELOPMENT. BUT IF  AIR 
PARCELS CAN BREAK THE RELATIVELY WEAK CAP...THEN ADDITIONAL 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL OCCUR THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

BY FRIDAY...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH ORIGINATING OUT OF THE CENTRAL 
ROCKIES THURSDAY AFTERNOON WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS MISSOURI FRIDAY. 
THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON. WE EXPECT THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE 
COLD FRONT WHERE VERY UNSTABLE AIR WILL BE LOCATED. SOME STORMS MAY 
BE SEVERE FRIDAY WITH LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS. 

IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT...CONSIDERABLY COLDER TEMPERATURES 
WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION SATURDAY. RAIN WILL MOVE EAST OF THE 
AREA FRIDAY NIGHT LEAVING COLD NORTHERLY WINDS BEHIND. MAX 
TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY REACH THE 60S SATURDAY. SUNDAY MORNING COULD 
PRODUCE SOME FROST ACROSS PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY

MID 60S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S. FRONTAL BOUNDARY
STRETCHES FROM SOUTHERN WISCONSIN THROUGH CENTRAL NEBRASKA WITH
QUITE A BIT OF THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY THROUGH IOWA AND EASTERN
NEBRASKA. THIS FRONT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE SOUTHWARD TODAY AND TONIGHT.
BY THURSDAY MORNING...THE FRONT SHOULD BE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND
INTO NORTHERN MISSOURI. FEEL THAT THIS POSITION IS A LITTLE TOO FAR
NORTH FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA TO SEE ANY THUNDERSTORMS FOR
TONIGHT SO HAVE REMOVED POPS FROM THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA. BY THURSDAY...FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO SAG SOUTH AND THIS WILL
BRING A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA. SPC DOES

LITTLE MORE APPARENT TO OUR WEST...OVER OKLAHOMA AND WESTERN
ARKANSAS. WHILE OVERNIGHT DEWPOINTS WERE IN THE 50S. THEY HAVE

DAYS HAS SHOWN A DECREASE IN AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS AFTER THE CUMULUS
FIELD DEVELOPS. TEMPERATURES GENERALLY WITHIN A FEW DEGREES OF 80...

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH NOT IN A HURRY TO MOVE EASTWARD. MOISTURE WILL SLOWLY
INCREASE OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS...BUT SHOULDNT REALLY BE NOTICED

IMPULSES TRYING TO MOVE OVER THE RIDGE. WHILE AN AREA OF SHOWERS
CANNOT BE RULED OUT THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...FEEL CHANCES ARE
LESS THAN 20 PERCENT OF ANYONE MEASURING...AND WILL KEEP FORECAST
DRY. PERSISTANCE LOOKS TO BE A GOOD TEMPERATURE FORECAST THROUGH
TOMORROW.

MODELS START BRINGING IMPULSES OVERTOP THE UPPER RIDGE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. MOISTURE WILL BE A LITTLE BIT BETTER...AND WILL KEEP 20 POPS
IN THE FORECAST. CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION GET BETTER FOR THURSDAY
AND FRIDAY AS FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH. BEST
CHANCES FOR RAIN WOULD BE ON FRIDAY...WITH APPARENT FRONTAL PASSAGE.
A FEW STRONG STORMS ARE POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY...BUT WILL NOT PLAY UP AT
THIS POINT. ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER WILL DRAG TEMPERATURES DOWN A
COUPLE OF DEGREES FOR HIGHS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...BUT STILL NEAR
OR ABOVE NORMAL.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER FRIDAY)...
SYSTEM SHOULD CLEAR THE AREA ON SATURDAY. FORECAST UPPER AIR PATTERN
OF DEEP TROF OVER EASTERN U.S. IS VERY UNSEASONABLE...AND WOULD NOT
BE SURPRISED IF MODEL GUIDANCE MODERATES ON THE DEPTH OF THE TROF.
HAVE TRENDED WEEKEND TEMPERATURES DOWN...BUT NOT QUITE TO THE EXTENT
OF THE GFS YET. IF TIME HEIGHTS ARE CORRECT ON GFS...MEMPHIS WOULD
LIKELY BE IN THE 50S OR LOWER 60S ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. IF THE
TREND BECOMES CONSISTENT OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO...ADDITIONAL
LOWERING OF TEMPERATURES FOR THE WEEKEND IS POSSIBLE.

A WEAK SHORTWAVE THAT BROUGHT SPRINKLES AND A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS TO
PORTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH EARLY THIS MORNING WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE
TO THE EAST TODAY. THIS WILL BRING AN END TO ANY EARLY MORNING
SHOWER ACTIVITY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES
WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE MID-SOUTHS WEATHER THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
WITH MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS AND WARM TEMPERATURES.

THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM TO BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT OUR WEATHER FOR THE END OF THIS WEEK AND
INTO THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. BY WEDNESDAY...A NORTHERN STREAM
SHORTWAVE WILL DROP ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION AND CONTINUE INTO
THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION THROUGH THURSDAY. AS THIS OCCURS...IT
SHOULD FORCE A COLD FRONT TO DROP SOUTHWARD...APPROACHING NORTHERN
SECTIONS OF THE MID-SOUTH BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED
TO STALL JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THURSDAY BEFORE
SLOWLY LIFTING BACK NORTH AS A WARM FRONT BY THURSDAY NIGHT. WITH
THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND A MODERATELY
UNSTABLE AIRMASS IN PLACE...HAVE KEPT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
NIGHT. THE HIGHEST CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS THROUGH
THURSDAY NIGHT.

ON FRIDAY...A STRONGER SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE AREA FROM
THE NORTHWEST. THIS SHOULD HELP TO SEND A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE
AREA BY FRIDAY EVENING. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH
FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEKEND. THERE ARE SOME TIMING ISSUES WITH
THE HANDLING OF THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. HAVE INCREASED CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT AND LINGERING
POPS INTO SATURDAY...TO ACCOUNT FOR THE TIMING DIFFERENCES
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. THE AIRMASS WILL BECOME
INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE BY FRIDAY...AND WIND FIELDS IN THE ATMOSPHERE
WILL STRENGTHEN...SO WILL NEED TO WATCH FOR ORGANIZED THUNDERSTORMS
WITH POSSIBLE SEVERE POTENTIAL. STILL MANY DETAILS TO WORK OUT
ON THIS...SO WILL ONLY MENTION POSSIBILITY OF STRONG STORMS IN HWO
FOR NOW.

ONCE THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH...EXPECT HIGH PRESSURE TO BUILD BACK IN
WITH A COOLER AIRMASS FILTERING IN. SO EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO

ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY ON TAP FOR THE MID SOUTH AS AN UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGE SLOWLY TRANSLATES EAST ACROSS THE REGION. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL ANCHOR ITSELF OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. LATER TODAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. THE RESULT WILL BE DRY AND WARM TEMPERATURES. 

A RATHER ACTIVE PATTERN SETS UP ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. TODAY AS A 
STRONG LOW LEVEL JET PUMPS DEEPER MOISTURE ACROSS THE PLAINS OF WEST 
TEXAS INTO THE DAKOTAS. THIS TYPE OF MOISTURE PATTERN WILL MOVE 
TOWARDS THE MID SOUTH BY WEDNESDAY. CHANCES FOR SOME THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE POSSIBLE HOWEVER LATEST MODELS INDICATE MOISTURE BEING 
LIMITED. ALSO VERY WEAK WAVES IN THE MEAN FLOW SEEM TO BE POORLY 
HANDLED BY BOTH THE GFS AND NAM WHICH LOWERS CONFIDENCE IN CURRENT 
SOLUTIONS. BELIEVE THE BETTER RAIN CHANCES COME WITH THE PATTERN 
CHANGE TO NORTHWEST FLOW AND THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. MOISTURE 
POOLING ALONG THE FRONT...DECENT ASCENT AND INSTABILITY SHOULD BRING 
RAIN TO THE REGION BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THE NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN 
WILL PERSIST INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND. THE LATEST GFS 
BUILDS A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED...BLOCKING RIDGE OVER THE MISSISSIPPI  
VALLEY EARLY SUNDAY THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WOULD 
KEEP THE MID SOUTH DRY FROM SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...SHOULD THIS PAN

RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WITH WINDS DECOUPLING 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA AS A RESULT. INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY 
SHOWING CIRRUS ACROSS MO/AR WHICH WILL MOVE ACROSS A PORTION OF THE 
AREA OVERNIGHT. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ARE IN THE

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 248 PM CDT SAT APR 16 2004.

AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS LOCATED ALONG THE APPALACHIANS. WINDS 
ARE MAINLY SOUTHEASTERLY AND LIGHT DUE TO THE HIGH. A FEW CIRRUS IS 
EXPECTED TO DRIFT THROUGH THE AREA RESULTING IN MAINLY SUNNY SKIES. 
TEMPS HAVE BEEN MUCH WARMER THAN MODELS HAVE INDICATED. THIS IS 
LIKELY DUE TO THE MODELS POOR HANDLING OF DEW POINTS. THE ATMOSPHERE 
IS MUCH DRYER THAN EXPECTED WITH THE NEAREST 50 DEGREE DEW POINTS 
ALONG THE GULF COAST. AS A RESULT OUR TEMP TRENDS HAVE BEEN 
DESERT-LIKE...COOL NIGHTS WITH QUICK WARMING. 

NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO TONIGHTS FORECAST. OVERNIGHT LOW 
DISTRIBUTION SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT...JUST A COUPLE DEGREES 
WARMER AS THE AIR MASS MODIFIES. A COUPLE OF WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL 
MOVE OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. A FEW HIGH 
CLOUDS CAN BE EXPECTED. HAVE WARMER FORECAST THAN GUIDANCE FOR 
SUNDAY BASED UPON SEVERAL REASONS. THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IS THAT THE 
MODELS ARE INDICATING MUCH MORE CLOUDS TOMORROW. GIVEN JUST HOW DRY 
THE LOWER LEVELS ARE...HAVE A HARD TIME BELIEVING THAT ENOUGH 
MOISTURE WILL ADVECT IN FOR CU DEVELOPMENT. SO MAINLY LOOKING AT 
JUST A FEW MORE CIRRUS THAN TODAY. ALSO...MODEL DEW POINTS STILL 
LOOK TOO HIGH. SO TEMPS SHOULD BE VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY. 

THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN STILL LOOKS LIKE ITS AROUND MIDWEEK. THE GFS 
INDICATES THE UPPER RIDGE BREAKING DOWN WITH THE FLOW ACROSS THE 
MIDDLE PORTION OF THE US BECOMING MORE ZONAL. THE GFS LOOKS RATHER 
NOISY IN ITS SOLUTION WHICH BRINGS SEVERAL SMALLER LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEMS ACROSS THE AREA FOR THE LATER PART OF THE WEEK. NOT WILLING 
TO FORECAST ANY HIGH POPS FOR MID TO LATE WEEK AT THIS POINT DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS SOLUTION.

HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL OF WEATHER ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH...WITH AXIS
OF RIDGE NEAR THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. TEMPERATURES AT 1 AM WERE MAINLY
IN THE 50S...WITH MEM AT 62 AND SNH AT 45 BEING THE BIG OUTLIERS.
DEWPOINTS UPPER 30S TO MIDDLE 40S. WINDS ARE LIGHT AND SKIES ARE
MOSTLY CLEAR...WITH ONLY A FEW CIRRUS MOVING ACROSS THE AREA.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH MONDAY)...
SURFACE RIDGE SLOWLY SINKS SOUTHWARD AND WILL EVENTUALLY BE CENTERED
OVER GEORGIA ON MONDAY. GULF OF MEXICO WILL REMAIN CLOSED FOR
MOISTURE RETURN. WE NEVER REALLY GET INTO DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW EITHER.
THIS BASICALLY MEANS PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES DURING THE DAY...
AND MOSTLY CLEAR AT NIGHT. TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE NEAR
NORMAL FOR THE SEASON...WITH ONLY A DEGREE OR TWO OF WARMING EACH
DAY. HAVE MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO HIGH TEMPERATURE GRIDS BASED ON MAX
TEMPERATURES OBSERVED YESTERDAY. WOULD NOT BE SHOCKED TO SEE COOLER
FWC LOWS VERIFY TONIGHT...REASONING BELOW.

MODEL SOLUTIONS IN THE SHORT RANGE ARE A LITTLE BIT IFFY. BOTH MODELS
FORECAST SOUNDINGS FOR MEMPHIS SHOW SURFACE DEWPOINTS AT LEAST 5 TO
10 DEGREES WARMER THAN THE ASSOCIATED MOS GUIDANCE INDICATES FOR
SUNDAY AND MONDAY. BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...NAM/GFS FORECAST SOUNDINGS
SHOW SURFACE DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S. SURFACE OBS SHOW
CLOSEST 60 DEGREE DEWPOINTS NEAR CORPUS CHRISTI TEXAS...AND MOST OBS
IN THE NORTHERN GULF HAVE DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S. EVEN THE DEWPOINTS IN
THE MOS GUIDANCE MAY BE TOO HIGH...AND THEY ARE IN THE MID 50S.

GFS SOLUTION ALSO RATHER NOISY WITH IMPULSES TRYING TO CLIMB OVER
THE RIDGE SUNDAY AND MONDAY. CONSIDERING THE MOISTURE ISSUES
MENTIONED ABOVE...FEEL ANY THREAT OF DEVELOPING CONVECTION EITHER
AFTERNOON IS EXTREMELY SMALL...AND WILL KEEP ENTIRE SHORT TERM
PORTION OF FORECAST DRY.
&&

.LONG TERM (BEYOND MONDAY)...
NOT VERY CONFIDENT IN PRECIPITATION FORECAST FOR MID-WEEK. 18Z/15
DGEX SOLUTION WOULD INDICATE THAT AREA COULD BE DRY UNTIL ABOUT
THURSDAY NIGHT. MODELS NOT INDICATING ANY MAJOR SYSTEMS TO AFFECT
OUR AREA THROUGH THE 7 DAY PERIOD. ANY IMPULSES KICKED OUT OF THE
WESTERN TROF SHOULD BE MAINLY TO OUR NORTH AND WEST.  DUBIOUS ABOUT
00Z/16 GFS DEPICTION OF IMPULSES BEING KICKED OUT OF MEXICO IN
SOUTHERN STREAM. BOTH MODELS PRETTY MUCH DRY FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...SO
REMOVED POPS FROM THERE...WHICH FITS WITH NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH AND
SOUTH. WE HAVE LOW POPS MENTIONED FOR WEDNESDAY AND BEYOND...WHICH IS
SOMEWHAT SUPPORTED BY GUIDANCE. WILL NOT MAKE ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE
FOR NOW.

TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL...ESPECIALLY DURING
THE DAY. WITH AIR ACTUALLY A LITTLE DRIER THAN MODELS THINK...THE
FORECAST MINS MAY NEED TO BE LOWERED A COUPLE OF DEGREES...ESPECIALLY
IF CLOUDS ARE LACKING.

UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WAS RATHER PERSISTENT OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH EARLIER THIS WEEK IS NOW OFF THE COAST OF THE CAROLINAS. 
LOW CLOUDINESS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM STILL LINGERS ACROSS 
ALABAMA AND INTO CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDS THROUGH THE PLAINS 
STATES. THIS IS RESULTING IN NORTHERLY WINDS AND DRY WEATHER ACROSS 
THE MIDSOUTH REGION. 

EXPECT CUMULUS FIELD OVER PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MS TO DISSIPATE THIS 
EVENING...RESULTING IN CLEAR SKIES OVER THE REGION. HIGH PRESSURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER RIDGE WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. WINDS WILL GO LIGHT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF NIGHTS. 
WILL BE RATHER CHILLY TONIGHT SINCE DEW POINTS ARE STILL IN THE 40S. 
MOST LOCATIONS WILL FALL INTO THE MID 40S TONIGHT. MEMPHIS HEAT 
ISLAND WILL KEEP TEMPS UP...AROUND 50 WITH LOWER 40S POSSIBLE OVER 
SOME OF THE COLD SPOTS ACROSS WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS. 

850 TEMPS AROUND +8 SUPPORT TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S OVER THE 
WEEKEND WHICH IS BACKED UP BY GUIDANCE. TEMPS WILL WARM SLIGHTLY 
OVER THE WEEKEND AS THE AIR MASS MODIFIES. A POSSIBLE FLAW MAY BE ON 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON WHERE THE GFS SHOWS A VORT MOVING OUT OF THE PLAINS 
AND OVER THE AREA...POSSIBLY RESULTING IN AN ISOLATED AFTERNOON 
THUNDERSTORM. ETA AND EUROPEAN BOTH SHOW THIS VORT WEAKENING AS DID 
YESTERDAY/S RUN OF THE GFS. 

BY EARLY NEXT WEEK THE RIDGE AXIS WILL HAVE MOVED OVER THE 
APPALACHIAN REGION WITH A CLOSED LOW FORMING OVER THE MOUNTAIN WEST. 
GFS SHOWS A COUPLE OF WEEK SHORTWAVES EXITING FROM THE LOW AND 
MOVING UP THE SIDE OF THE RIDGE...POSSIBLY RESULTING IN AN AFTERNOON 
THUNDERSTORM MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE MOISTURE STILL DOESNT LOOK DEEP 
ENOUGH THOUGH SO WILL KEEP DRY FORECAST TILL TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY. AT THIS TIME...DEEPER MOISTURE SETS UP OVER THE REGION. 
LATEST RUN OF THE GFS SUGGESTS THAT MIDWEEK MAY BE RATHER UNSETTLED. 
THE CLOSED LOW STALLS OVER THE WESTERN PLAINS WITH SEVERAL WEAK 
SHORTWAVES MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. GUT FEELING IS THAT CONVECTION 
MAY BE MORE DIURNALLY DRIVEN AND SCATTERED SINCE THERE APPEARS TO BE 
NO REAL STRONG SYSTEMS TO ASSIGN POPS TO.

UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVING ACROSS NORTH GEORGIA THIS MORNING. SKIES
REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY EARLY THIS MORNING OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST
AREA BUT WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT WITH NORTHERN SECTIONS CLEARING OUT
BEFORE SUNRISE AND REMAINDER OF FORECAST AREA CLEARING OUT BY THIS
AFTERNOON. WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES...TEMPERATURES WILL WARM UP SOME
FROM YESTERDAY WITH MOST AREAS SEEING UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70. UPPER
LEVEL RIDGE BEGIN TO BUILD IN TODAY AND TONIGHT AND REMAIN OVER THE
REGION FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THIS WILL HELP ENCOURAGE A LENGTHY
DRY PERIOD OVER THE REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO WARM UP SOME AND
LEVEL OFF AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS DURING THIS DRY PERIOD.
THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN DOES NOT OCCUR UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT. BY THEN
THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE FINALLY BREAKS DOWN AND A STORM SYSTEM MOVES
FROM OUT OF THE ROCKIES AND BRINGS A COLD FRONT INTO THE PLAINS. THIS
FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST ON WEDNESDAY KEEPING US IN THE THREAT OF
RAIN.

THE WEAKENING UPPER LOW WAS LOCATED OVER NEAR CHATTANOOGA...MOVING 
SOUTHEAST. THE AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN HAVE DISSIPATED ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH AND CLOUDS CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE REGION. EXPECT CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS TO PERSIST THROUGH THE NIGHT FOR THE FORECAST AREA. AS 
THE STORM SYSTEM MOVES FARTHER EAST...CLOUDS WILL BREAK UP SHORTLY 
AFTER SUNRISE. THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK LOOKS PLEASANT.

WILL UPDATE THE GRIDS TO ACCOMMODATE FOR THE INCREASED CLOUD COVER 
AND REMOVE SHOWER WORDING FROM EASTERN AREAS. OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE CLOSE TO FORECAST VALUES...PERHAPS SLIGHTLY HIGHER DUE TO 
THE CLOUD COVER BUT ONLY 2 TO 3 DEGREES. WILL WATCH THIS FOR

AFTER TODAY...THE MIDSOUTH WILL FINALLY ENJOY A PROLONGED PERIOD OF
DRY WEATHER WITH PLEASANT TEMPERATURES. THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN IS
NOT FORECAST UNTIL NEXT TUESDAY NIGHT AT THE EARLIEST.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES AN UPPER LOW SPINNING OVER
NORTHERN AL/SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN THIS AFTERNOON. THIS LOW WILL MOVE
SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH THURSDAY AND LOSE INFLUENCE OVER MIDSOUTH
WEATHER. MEANWHILE...HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WILL BUILD INTO THE
MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

CLOUDS COVER THE MIDSOUTH THIS AFTERNOON WITH SOME BREAKS
DEVELOPING. THINK DRIER AIR WILL WORK ITS WAY INTO THE MIDSOUTH
OVERNIGHT...WITH SKIES BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS MUCH OF THE
AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. THINK MOST OF THE RAIN WILL BE OUT OF THE AREA
BY 6 PM. HOWEVER...DEPENDING ON WHAT THE RADAR INDICATES THE NEXT
COUPLE OF HOURS...MAY LEAVE IN A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS EAST OF
THE MS RIVER FOR EARLY THIS EVENING. OTHERWISE...SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY
SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY THURSDAY...THEN WE CAN EXPECT CLEAR SKIES
AFTER THAT INTO THE WEEKEND.

A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST BY THE LATEST GFS TO MOVE INTO THE
MIDSOUTH NEXT WEDNESDAY. THIS FRONT WILL BRING OUR NEXT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS...POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS TUESDAY NIGHT FOR PART
OF THE AREA.

LOWS WILL DIP INTO THE 40S THE NEXT FEW NIGHTS WITH NORTHEAST
WINDS...BUT WARMER AFTERNOONS CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THE RETURN OF
SUNSHINE.

SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS WEST TN AND NORTHEAST AR...WITH THE
SHOWERS MOVING INTO NORTH MS. SATELLITE SHOWS LOW CLOUDS ROTATING

UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY SITUATED OVER SOUTHEAST MISSOURI WILL
TRACK SOUTHEAST TODAY AND IS EXPECTED TO REACH THE GEORGIA COAST BY
THURSDAY MORNING. SOME SHOWERS ARE JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA
AND SHOULD MOVE IN SHORTLY. EXPECT COVERAGE OF SHOWERS TODAY SHOULD
REMAIN SCATTERED SO CHANCE POPS SHOULD WORK JUST FINE. CLOUD COVER IN
ASSOCIATION WITH THE UPPER LOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES DOWN A FEW
DEGREES FROM YESTERDAY. UPPER LOW SHOULD BE FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT THAT WE SHOULD REMAIN DRY AFTER 00Z SO YANKED
WHAT LITTLE POPS THERE WERE. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION
BY FRIDAY ALLOWING FOR A PROLONGED DRY PERIOD WHICH SHOULD LAST FROM

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WERE ROTATING AROUND THIS SYSTEM. A FEW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE FORMED OVER NE ARKANSAS OVER THE PAST HOUR. 
THEY WILL ROTATE EASTWARD INTO WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN 
MISSISSIPPI THROUGH THE EVENING. THE UPPER LOW WILL BEGIN TO DRIFT 
INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE BY 9 AM. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT AND AGAIN WEDNESDAY AS THE INFLUENCE OF THE

SOME SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS CONTINUE OVER EASTERN HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. RAIN IS GENERALLY MOVING NORTH WITH A
SLOW EASTWARD SHIFT. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN FOR THIS MORNING IN
THE EASTERN HALF BUT OTHERWISE WITH UPPER LOW STILL OVER EASTERN
KANSAS IT APPEARS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SHOULD BE GOOD ENOUGH FOR
TODAY. UPPER LOW WILL SLOWLY PUSH EAST TONIGHT AND REACH WESTERN
KENTUCKY. HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA FOR TONIGHT WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE SOUTH. BY WEDNESDAY
MORNING...UPPER LOW INTERACTS WITH ANOTHER UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER
THE NEW ENGLAND COAST. THIS WILL CAUSE WESTERN KENTUCKY LOW TO TRACK
SOUTH THROUGH MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND NORTH ALABAMA. WITH CLOSE
PROXIMITY TO UPPER LOW WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN FOR WEDNESDAY. UPPER
LOW SHOULD WEAKEN AND MOVE FAR ENOUGH EAST BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT THAT
ONLY FAR NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF FORECAST MAY SEE RAIN WEDNESDAY
EVENING SO HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THEN. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE THEN
TAKES OVER GIVING US SEVERAL DAYS OF DRY WEATHER FROM THURSDAY

NORTHEAST. THESE STORMS FORMED ALONG THE DRYLINE/FRONT WHERE THE 
BEST CONVERGENCE WAS OCCURRING EARLIER THIS EVENING. 

THE STRONG UPPER LOW WAS LOCATED OVER CENTRAL KS AND WILL MOVE INTO

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS AFTERNOON PLACES COLD FRONT 
ACROSS OK/TN/AR BORDER. VISIBLE/88D TRENDS SHOW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT WHERE ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN 
ABLE TO DESTABILIZE.  MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS FORECAST PACKAGE 
IS SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL THIS EVENING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
EXPECTING CONVECTION ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS TO DEVELOP INTO A LINE 
AND MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE 
FORECAST TO BECOME MODERATELY STEEP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
TONIGHT. IF BOUNDARY LAYER CAN RECOVER BEFORE UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE 
MOVES EAST OF THE AREA...THINK THAT SEVERE POTENTIAL MAY LAST 
THROUGH MIDNIGHT WITH WIND PROFILES SUPPORTIVE OF DAMAGING WINDS. 
EVENING SHIFT WILL MONITOR CONVECTIVE TRENDS AND UPDATE AS NEEDED. 
THE COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY MORNING 
AND WILL CONTINUE POPS INTO WEDNESDAY AS CUTOFF UPPER LEVEL LOW 
GRADUALLY MOVES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY AND ACROSS THE EAST COAST BY THURSDAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
START TO BUILD IN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH ON THURSDAY AS CUTOFF LOW 
MOVES UP THE EAST COAST AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING MOVES INTO THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH CLOUD COVER GRADUALLY DIMINISHING BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT. 

.FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BRING 
PRECIPITATION FREE WEATHER TO THE MID SOUTH THROUGH SUNDAY. ADDED A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY AS LONG RANGE MODELS DEPICT ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AS THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN.

EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS WITH A WARM FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS MAINLY 
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWING EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
AFFECTS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER THE 
PAST COUPLE OF HOURS SHOWING DRY SLOT WIDENING ACROSS SOUTHWEST

SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL. 

12Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS SHOWS 40KT 850MB LOW LEVEL JET ACROSS 
LOUISIANA TRANSPORTING +10-14C DEWPOINTS INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY...5C OR GREATER 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS UPSTREAM...AND 
UPPER LEVEL DIFLUENCE NOTED AT 250 MB ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY. CURRENT DATA SUGGESTS THAT BEST SEVERE POTENTIAL MAY BE 
POSSIBLE MAINLY THIS EVENING ESPECIALLY ALONG AND SOUTH OF 
I-40...ROUGHLY ABOUT THE SAME TIME UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE BEGINS TO 
MOVE EAST. MOST UNSTABLE CAPES WILL INCREASE TO AROUND 1400 J/KG BY 
MID TO LATE EVENING. NEARLY UNIDIRECTIONAL WINDS AT 850/500 MB 
SUGGEST PRIMARY THREAT WOULD BE IN THE FORM OF DAMAGING WINDS. A 
SUPERCELL OR CIRCULATIONS WITHIN THE CONVECTIVE LINE WILL BE 
POSSIBLE AS BACKING SURFACE WINDS AND 0-6KM BULK SHEAR VALUES AT OR

EARLY THIS MORNING. INSTABILITY STILL THE MAJOR LIMITING FACTOR IN
SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS TODAY. SOUNDINGS VERY
MOIST DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY...AND SOME QUESTION AS TO THE

ANYTIME BEFORE LATE AFTERNOON. SATELLITE SHOWS PLENTY OF BREAKS IN
CLOUD COVER ACROSS OUR CWA...BUT WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW...THIS COULD
FILL IN WITH STRATUS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS.

COULD SEE SOME SHOWERS THIS MORNING...BUT ANY SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION
WILL NEED TO WAIT UNTIL THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS TO
DEVELOP. EARLY ON...THERE WILL BE ENOUGH TURNING TO PROMOTE
DEVELOPMENT OF SUPERCELLS...BUT EXPECT THE PREDOMINANT CONVECTIVE
MODE TO BECOME LINEAR BY SUNSET OR SO. HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS WILL
BE MAIN THREATS...BUT CANT RULE OUT A TORNADO...ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN
PORTIONS OF CWA. MAIN IMPULSE SHOULD BE CLEAR OF THE AREA BY 09Z
TUESDAY...ENDING LARGEST THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER.

MODELS SHOW WE SHOULD DRY SLOT FOR MOST OF THE DAY ON TUESDAY. AS
COLD CORE DRIFTS SOUTHEAST OVER THE AREA TUESDAY AFTERNOON...THERE
MAY BE JUST ENOUGH MOISTURE TO DEVELOP A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. WITH
STEEP LAPSE RATES AND COLD 500 MB TEMPS...COULD SEE A FEW HAILERS
NEAR THE UPPER LOW. WILL NOT PLAY UP THIS POTENTIAL AT THIS TIME...
BUT WILL KEEP AN EYE ON IT.

UPPER LOW WILL WOBBLE AROUND THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE UNDER THE LOW...WITH
PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER.

TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL DEPEND ON CLOUD COVER. GFS FEEDBACK ISSUES
LEAD ME TO DISCOUNT MAV HIGH TEMP GUIDANCE TODAY...ESPECIALLY SINCE

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES SURFACE LOW ACROSS 
EXTREME SOUTHEAST COLORADO WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT/DRYLINE 
EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS SOUTHERN TEXAS. SURFACE MOISTURE TONGUE 
EXTENDS ACROSS MUCH OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH 60+ SURFACE 
DEWPOINTS. VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWING DIURNAL CUMULUS ACROSS MUCH OF 
THE AREA AND HIGH/MID CLOUDS GRADUALLY MOVING EAST WITH DEVELOPING 
CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. MAIN CONCERNS THIS FORECAST 
PACKAGE IS SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT.

TONIGHT...45KT 850 MB LOW LEVEL JET WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE MID 
SOUTH TONIGHT TRANSPORTING 60+ SURFACE DEWPOINT AIR INTO THE AREA BY 
MONDAY AFTERNOON. LINE OF CONVECTION CURRENTLY DEVELOPING MOSTLY 
ALONG DRYLINE IN TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA THIS AFTERNOON WILL SPREAD 
ACROSS ARKANSAS TONIGHT. THINK THAT MOST IF NOT ALL SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BEGIN TO FALL APART AS MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A 
CAPPING INVERSION AND SOME LOW LEVEL DRY AIR TO BE OVERCOME ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION WILL BE AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...MOSTLY ALONG AND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. THINK 
THAT ANY SEVERE THREAT WOULD BE MAINLY HAIL BUT EXPECT ANY 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT DO DEVELOP SHOULD STAY BELOW SEVERE LIMITS.

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING THE DAY AS UPPER 
LEVEL LOW MOVES ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND BECOMES NEGATIVELY 
TILTED. MID LEVEL DYNAMICAL FORCING /700-500 MB Q-VECTOR 
CONVERGENCE/ WILL INCREASE INTO THE EVENING. RATHER RESPECTIVE 700 MB 
DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS /10C OR GREATER ALONG I-40 AND SOUTH)...SBCAPES 
APPROACHING 2000 J/KG...LI/S AROUND -5...AND A FAVORABLE WIND 
PROFILE SUPPORT A SEVERE WEATHER THREAT OF DAMAGING WINDS AND HAIL 
ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AFTERNOON AND MONDAY NIGHT. 
ADDITIONALLY...BACKING SURFACE WINDS...0-6 KM BULK SHEAR VALUES AT 
OR ABOVE 40KTS...AND 0-1KM SRH VALUES AT OR ABOVE 200M2/S2 SUPPORT 
SUPERCELL DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER...SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY MAY BE 
LIMITED...ESPECIALLY FURTHER NORTH OF I-40 IF THE FORECAST AREA 
REMAINS CLOUDY DURING THE DAY. CONVECTION IN THE AFTERNOON SHOULD 
DEVELOP AS ISOLATED/SCATTERED CONVECTION AHEAD OF A BOWING LINE AS 
EVENT PROGRESSES. BEST RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER WILL PRIMARILY RESIDE 
ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. HEAVY RAINFALL STILL A POSSIBILITY WITH 
SOME OF THE THUNDERSTORMS WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AT OR ABOVE 
1.5 INCHES. LATEST 18Z NAM CURRENTLY COMING IN SUGGESTS PASSAGE OF 
TROUGH MAY BE DELAYED BY 3-6 HOURS FROM THE 12Z SOLUTION. EVENING 
SHIFT WILL FURTHER REFINE TIMING ON THIS POSSIBLE SEVERE WEATHER 
THREAT.  

UPPER LEVEL CUTOFF LOW WILL GRADUALLY MOVE EAST ACROSS KENTUCKY 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO POPS ON TUESDAY AS MAIN 
SHORTWAVE DEPARTS ON TUESDAY AND ANOTHER SHORTWAVE APPROACHES THE 
MID SOUTH FROM THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.

.THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...STILL WAS SOME FEEDBACK ISSUES EARLY ON 
WITH THE GFS AND WILL LEAN MORE TOWARDS DGEX/EUROPEAN SOLUTION FOR 
THE LONG RANGE PERIOD. SHEAR AXIS ASSOCIATED WITH CUTOFF LOW WILL BRING A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS TO THE MID SOUTH ON THURSDAY WITH DRY 
WEATHER EXPECTED FOR FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS BOTH DGEX AND 
EUROPEAN SHOW UPPER LEVEL RIDGE ACROSS THE EASTERN US...THOUGH THE 
EUROPEAN IS MORE AMPLIFIED WITH ITS SOLUTION.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS EVENING INDICATES AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OF
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MIDSOUTH WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ANALYZED
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. LIGHT SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE
OVER THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. THIS WILL HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES MILD
OVERNIGHT AND THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS THIS HANDLED WELL. PLENTY OF
SINKING AIR UNDER THE RIDGE WILL SUPPRESS MOST CLOUD COVER...SO SKIES
SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR. AREA DEWPOINTS REMAIN IN THE UPPER 50S
TO LOW 60S...AND WITH CLEAR SKIES SOME PATCHY FOG MAY DEVELOP IN
TYPICALLY FAVORED AREAS (IE. NEAR MKL AND ALONG THE TENNESSEE
RIVER). THIS FOG SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED SO NOT PLANNING ON ADDING TO

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
340 PM CDT SAT APR 9 2005

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS AFTERNOON PLACES HIGH PRESSURE 
ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. HIGHS THIS AFTERNOON SO FAR 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH RANGE FROM THE MIDDLE 70S TO AROUND 80. VISIBLE 
SATELLITE TRENDS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS SHOW SOME DIURNAL CUMULUS 
DEVELOPMENT. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS SEVERE 
WEATHER/HEAVY RAINFALL POTENTIAL ON MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT.

TONIGHT...QUIET EVENING EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT. SOME 
DIURNAL CUMULUS WHICH FORMED ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...MAINLY ACROSS ARKANSAS MISSISSIPPI AND THE SW PORTION OF TENNESSEE 
WILL DIMINISH TOWARDS SUNSET. SKIES WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY 
OVERNIGHT AS SOME CIRRUS MOVES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. NOT 
ANTICIPATING FOG TO BE MUCH OF A PROBLEM TONIGHT AS WINDS SHOULD 
STAY UP A BIT WITH AREA IN A SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE.

SUNDAY...EXPECTING A FEW MORE CLOUDS DURING THE DAY AS NEXT AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE MOVES FROM THE ROCKIES INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. NAM/GFS 
DEVELOP A WEAK SHORTWAVE IN SOUTHWEST FLOW ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
DURING THE AFTERNOON...BUT THINK AREA WILL STAY DRY WITH A CAPPING 
INVERSION PRESENT. 

SUNDAY NIGHT...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP 
ALONG A DRYLINE IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MOVE OVERNIGHT ACROSS 
ARKANSAS. THINK THAT SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN MOSTLY OFF TO 
THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...WILL KEEP SLIGHT 
CHANCE/CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE WESTERN ONE THIRD OF THE CWA.

MONDAY...STILL UNCERTAIN IF THERE WILL BE A SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK 
ON MONDAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH INSTABILITY THE BIG 
QUESTION. LATEST MODEL RUNS QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT THAN THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS. MOISTURE LEFT OVER FROM PREVIOUS LINE OF CONVECTION 
SHOULD KEEP FORECAST AREA MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR MOST OF THE DAY. 
ADDITIONALLY...BETTER SUPPORT FROM MID LEVEL DYNAMICAL FORCING 
/700-500 MB Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE/ WILL NOT ARRIVE UNTIL AROUND OR 
SLIGHTLY AFTER 00Z. WIND PROFILES SUGGEST THAT CONVECTION WILL 
DEVELOP INTO A LINE BUT THINK BEST SEVERE POTENTIAL WILL BE FURTHER 
SOUTH ACROSS CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI/LOUISIANA WHERE BETTER DAMAGING 
WIND POTENTIAL WILL BE POSSIBLE AS NOTED BY 700 MB DEWPOINT 
DEPRESSIONS. HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL STILL LOOKS SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE 
ACROSS AT LEAST THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1.5 INCHES AND K-INDICIES AROUND 
35.  ON TUESDAY THE CUTOFF SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE 
MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY PRODUCING ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH.

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...CUTOFF LOW WILL WEAKEN AND WILL MOVE TOWARD 
THE EAST COAST BY THURSDAY NIGHT. RAIN CHANCES WILL GRADUALLY 
DIMINISH BY THURSDAY BEFORE ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHES THE MID SOUTH 
BY THE WEEKEND.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
324 PM CDT FRI APR 8 2005

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES SURFACE LOW JUST OF THE COAST 
OF SOUTH CAROLINA THIS AFTERNOON. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS 
CLOUDS FINALLY BEGINNING TO BREAK UP ACROSS THE MID SOUTH...MAINLY 
ALONG THE EDGES SO FAR. TEMPERATURES HAVE RECOVERED INTO THE MIDDLE 60S 
WHERE STRATUS HAS ERODED A BIT. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS PACKAGE 
IS FOG POTENTIAL TONIGHT AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES ON MONDAY.

TONIGHT...SKIES WILL CLEAR TONIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS LOW 
PRESSURE MOVES OFF THE EAST COAST AND 1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S DROP 
DOWN TO AROUND 40 PERCENT TONIGHT. ANTICIPATING FOG TO FORM FROM 
RECENT RAINFALL ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT AS WINDS DECOUPLE AND 
SKIES BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR. I STILL THINK THAT BEST FOG POTENTIAL 
WILL BE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS A 
RESULT...I/LL MENTION AREAS OF FOG ACROSS ABOVE MENTIONED AREA AND 
PATCHY FOG ELSEWHERE. LOWS TONIGHT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WILL DROP 
INTO THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S.

SATURDAY...PLEASANT DAY EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING BUILDS IN ACROSS THE AREA. 850 MB TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO 
AROUND 11C...PRODUCING HIGHS IN THE 70S. EXPECTING MOSTLY 
SUNNY/PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH SOME CIRRUS AS AREA TRANSITIONS BACK 
INTO WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN. 

SATURDAY NIGHT...A VERY WEAK AND POORLY DEFINED WARM FRONT WILL PASS 
THROUGH THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BUT NOT EXPECTING ANY 
PRECIPITATION WITH THIS FEATURE AS MOISTURE WILL BE LACKING AND A 
700 MB CAPPING INVERSION PRESENT. 

SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...NAM/GFS AGREE ON CONVECTION DEVELOPING IN 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS SUNDAY NIGHT AND SPREADING INTO THE MID SOUTH ON 
MONDAY. FIRST LINE OF CONVECTION MAY DISSIPATE BEFORE REACHING 
THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY. ANOTHER LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL DEVELOP ALONG A DRYLINE ACROSS EASTERN OKLAHOMA/TEXAS/AND 
WESTERN ARKANSAS DURING THE DAY...AND REACHING THE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. STILL SOME ISSUES WITH 
AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY AVAILABLE AND THINK SEVERE POTENTIAL MAY 
BECOME A CONCERN BUT WILL WAIT FOR FURTHER RUNS WITH EVENT CURRENTLY 
IN THE 5TH TO 6TH PERIOD BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES TO CURRENT HWO.

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...CUTOFF LOW WITH TRAILING COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE GRADUALLY 
BUILDING BACK IN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. LOWERED POPS WEDNESDAY AS 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING MOVES OVERHEAD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND 
PROVIDES PRECIPITATION FREE WEATHER TO THE MID SOUTH...AT LEAST 
THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST AND BE NEAR SAVANNAH GA TONIGHT.
LOW CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY ROTATE EAST OF THE AREA. WILL WAIT UNTIL
THE LAST MINUTE TO DETERMINE POPS ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE THIS
MORNING...MAY JUST MENTION A FEW SPRINKLES. ANTICIPATE DECREASE IN
CLOUDS DURING THE DAY...AND SEVERAL HOURS OF SUNSHINE SHOULD ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE MIDDLE 60S ACROSS MOST AREAS.

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. WET GROUND...
CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL AID IN POSSIBLE FOG FORMATION...
ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHERN 2/3RDS OF AREA...WHERE GROUND IS
WETTEST. AIR IS NOT AS DRY AS EARLIER MODEL RUNS WOULD INDICATE.
RAISED LOWS TONIGHT FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST...BUT STILL SEVERAL
DEGREES BELOW NUMERICAL GUIDANCE.

SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNS SATURDAY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND.
SKIES SHOULD BE PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.
TEMPERATURES SATURDAY ABOUT 10 DEGREES WARMER THAN TODAY...AND
MAYBE ANOTHER 2 OR 3 DEGREES WARMER ON SUNDAY. BOOSTED TEMPERATURE
FORECAST FOR SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT SEVERAL DEGREES...BUT
STILL REMAIN BELOW GUIDANCE ON LOWS SATURDAY NIGHT.

AS UPPER SYSTEM KICKS OUT OF 4 CORNERS AREA SUNDAY...IT MAY GET
CLOSE ENOUGH TO BRING A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION TO THE WESTERN HALF
OF THE AREA LATE SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS IS ALREADY ACCOUNTED FOR IN
CURRENT FORECAST.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER SUNDAY)...
SOME DISAGREEMENT ON HOW QUICKLY UPPER SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS THE AREA
EARLY NEXT WEEK. UPPER LOW FORECAST TO BE OVER KANSAS MONDAY NIGHT
WITH TROF NEGATIVELY TILTED OVER OUR AREA. THIS WOULD BRING
POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER AND HEAVY RAIN MONDAY NIGHT INTO
TUESDAY. ALREADY HAVE LIKELY POPS IN FOR MONDAY NIGHT.

THIS UPPER LOW FORECAST TO MOVE FURTHER NORTH THAN CURRENT SYSTEM.
THIS WOULD BRING LOWER PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND A LITTLE MILDER
WEATHER TO THE AREA THAN WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING NOW. DIDNT SEE A
REASON TO MAKE MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. PRECIP
SHOULD BE NORTH AND EAST OF THE AREA THURSDAY...HAVE REMOVED PRECIP
FOR THAT PERIOD.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
252 AM CDT FRI APR 8 2005

.DISCUSSION...
SURFACE LOW WELL OFF TO OUR EAST...NEAR TYS...WITH UPPER LOW OVER
EAST CENTRAL ALABAMA...MAYBE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN GUIDANCE DEPICTS.
A FEW SPRINKLES ROTATING AROUND UPPER LOW OVER WEST TENNESSEE...BUT
SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION HAS MOVED EAST OF THE AREA. SKIES REMAIN
CLOUDY...TEMPERATURES GENERALLY IN THE MIDDLE 50S WITH NORTHERLY
WINDS. CLEARING NOT VERY FAR AWAY...BUT UPPER LOW WILL HAVE TO MOVE
EAST BEFORE WE SEE ANY.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST AND BE NEAR SAVANNAH GA TONIGHT.
LOW CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY ROTATE EAST OF THE AREA. WILL WAIT UNTIL
THE LAST MINUTE TO DETERMINE POPS ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE THIS
MORNING...MAY JUST MENTION A FEW SPRINKLES. ANTICIPATE DECREASE IN
CLOUDS DURING THE DAY...AND SEVERAL HOURS OF SUNSHINE SHOULD ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE MIDDLE 60S ACROSS MOST AREAS.

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. WET GROUND...
CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL AID IN POSSIBLE FOG FORMATION...
EXPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHERN 2/3RDS OF AREA...WHERE GROUND IS
WETTEST. AIR IS NOT AS DRY AS EARLIER MODEL RUNS WOULD INDICATE.
RAISED LOWS TONIGHT FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST...BUT STILL SEVERAL
DEGREES BELOW NUMERICAL GUIDANCE.

SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNS SATURDAY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND.
SKIES SHOULD BE PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.
TEMPERATURES SATURDAY ABOUT 10 DEGREES WARMER THAN TODAY...AND
MAYBE ANOTHER 2 OR 3 DEGREES WARMER ON SUNDAY. BOOSTED TEMPERATURE
FORECAST FOR SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT SEVERAL DEGREES...BUT
STILL REMAIN BELOW GUIDANCE ON LOWS SATURDAY NIGHT.

AS UPPER SYSTEM KICKS OUT OF 4 CORNERS AREA SUNDAY...IT MAY GET
CLOSE ENOUGH TO BRING A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION TO THE WESTERN HALF
OF THE AREA LATE SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS IS ALREADY ACCOUNTED FOR IN
CURRENT FORECAST.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER SUNDAY)...
SOME DISAGREEMENT ON HOW QUICKLY UPPER SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS THE AREA
EARLY NEXT WEEK. UPPER LOW FORECAST TO BE OVER KANSAS MONDAY NIGHT
WITH TROF NEGATIVELY TILTED OVER OUR AREA. THIS WOULD BRING
POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER AND HEAVY RAIN MONDAY NIGHT INTO
TUESDAY. ALREADY HAVE LIKELY POPS IN FOR MONDAY NIGHT.

THIS UPPER LOW FORECAST TO MOVE FURTHER NORTH THAN CURRENT SYSTEM.
THIS WOULD BRING LOWER PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND A LITTLE MILDER
WEATHER TO THE AREA THAN WHAT WE ARE EXPERIENCING NOW. DIDNT SEE A
REASON TO MAKE MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. PRECIP
SHOULD BE NORTH AND EAST OF THE AREA THURSDAY...HAVE REMOVED PRECIP
FOR THAT PERIOD.

UPPER LOW OVER NORTHERN AL THIS EVENING IS CONTINUING TO MOVE
EASTWARD. SCATTERED SHOWERS WRAPPING AROUND THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW
ARE CONTINUING TO AFFECT THE MIDSOUTH...BUT ARE DECREASING IN
COVERAGE AND INTENSITY. WILL UPDATE TO LOWER POPS TO 30 PERCENT FOR
THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH AND REMOVE MENTION
OF THUNDERSTORMS. OVERNIGHT FORECAST LOWS LOOK FINE.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 332 PM CDT THU APR 7 2005

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES STACKED LOW PRESSURE
ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE. 88D TRENDS SHOW SHOWERS AND ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUING TO ROTATE AROUND THE LOW. A FEW REPORTS
CAME IN THIS AFTERNOON OF MAINLY PEA SIZE HAIL AS FREEZING LEVELS
HAVE BEEN AROUND 8KFT. MAIN CONCERNS THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS
PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL TONIGHT AND AGAIN FOR MONDAY.

TONIGHT...STACKED SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY ACROSS SW
TENNESSEE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST TONIGHT INTO MIDDLE AND EASTERN
TENNESSEE. MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS WILL ROTATE THROUGH THE AREA
TONIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN SATURATED
INTO THE EVENING...AND WILL CARRY NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND ISOLATED
THUNDER UNTIL LATE EVENING AND TAPER RAIN CHANCES OFF FROM LATE
EVENING ON. TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL DROP BACK INTO THE LOWER 50S
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH.

FRIDAY...MID UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT EAST ACROSS THE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY DURING THE DAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE SOME LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE AROUND 950 MB WILL PERSIST INTO AT LEAST EARLY
AFTERNOON AND SKIES GRADUALLY CLEARING BY LATE AFTERNOON.
TEMPERATURES WILL RECOVER A FEW DEGREES FROM THIS AFTERNOON/S HIGHS.

FRIDAY NIGHT...SKIES WILL CLEAR ACROSS THE MID SOUTH FRIDAY NIGHT.
THERE IS A GOOD POTENTIAL FOR FOG AMPLE SURFACE MOISTURE IN PLACE
FROM THE RECENT RAINFALL...CLEAR SKIES...AND DECOUPLED WINDS.
MENTIONED AREAS OF FOG IN FORECAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF
THE FORECAST AREA...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. LOWS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP
BACK INTO THE LOWER 50S.

SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL MOVE SLIGHTLY EAST BY
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. A WEAK MID LEVEL VORTICITY MAXIMUM WILL RIDE UP
THE RIDGE IN SOUTHWEST FLOW PATTERN...BUT NOT ANTICIPATING ANY
RAINFALL WITH THIS FEATURE. 850 MB TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO AROUND
12C...PRODUCING HIGHS IN THE 70S.

.EXTENDED...LONG RANGE PATTERN LOOKS RATHER UNSETTLED AS LONG WAVE
TROUGH CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS THE WEST COAST OF U.S. WILL DEVELOP
A 500MB LOW. GFS CURRENTLY ADVERTISING A LINE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG A DRYLINE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS
SUNDAY NIGHT AND AFFECT THE MID SOUTH ON MONDAY. NAM/GFS SHOW SOME
POSSIBLE SEVERE POTENTIAL WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM BUT WILL ONLY
MENTION POTENTIAL AS STRONG IN HWO FOR NOW AND WAIT FOR SOME LATER
MODEL RUNS BEFORE STRENGTHENING WORDING. THIS LOW WILL THEN BECOME
CUTOFF FROM THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW AND WOBBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN US
THROUGH THE END OF THE LONG RANGE FORECAST. AS A RESULT...WILL NOT
MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO CURRENT LONG RANGE FORECAST WITH A CHANCE
OF PRECIPITATION NEARLY EVERY DAY.

1050 AM CDT THU APR 7 2005

.DISCUSSION...LATEST ANALYSIS PLACES STACKED SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL 
LOW PRESSURE ACROSS SOUTHWEST TENNESSEE. 12Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS 
DEPICTS SEVERAL SHORTWAVE LOBES ROTATING AROUND THE LOW. MAIN FORECAST 
CONCERNS FOR THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE THUNDER POTENTIAL AND 
TEMPERATURES. MODEL SOUNDINGS PRODUCE 600-700 J/KG OF CAPE...LI/S 
AROUND -2...AND SHOWALTER VALUES APPROACHING ZERO. WILL MENTION 
NUMEROUS RAIN SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON. I THINK MOST AREAS WILL JUST HAVE A RUMBLE OR TWO AT BEST 
AS A COUPLE OF LIGHTNING REPORTS WERE REPORTED OVER THE PAST HOUR. 
TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH ARE CURRENTLY IN THE UPPER 50S TO 
LOWER 60S AND WILL MAKE ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON CURRENT TRENDS SINCE 
CLOUD COVER WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES MOSTLY STEADY OR RISE A FEW 
DEGREES AT BEST THIS AFTERNOON. PRECIPITATION SHOULD GRADUALLY BEGIN 
TO DIMINISH TONIGHT AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES EAST.

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE PUBLISHED SHORTLY.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 130 AM CDT THU APR 7 2005.

WEATHER HAS QUIETED DOWN THIS MORNING. LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS THAT 
PRODUCED SOME SEVERE WEATHER IN THE CWA DURING THE EVENING HAS 
PUSHED WELL EAST OF THE AREA. SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS EASTERN ARKANSAS AT THIS 
TIME. THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN 
UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. THE UPPER LOW IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE MOVING 
EASTWARD ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI TODAY. SHOWERS AND SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP AS THE LOW MOVES ACROSS THE 
CWA. ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT OCCUR TODAY IS EXPECTED TO STAY BELOW 
SEVERE LIMITS AS CLOUD COVER WILL KEEP INSTABILITY WEAK ACROSS THE 
CWA. UPPER LOW WILL EXIT CWA BY THIS EVENING. ALTHOUGH EXPECT 
CHANCES OF SHOWERS TO CONTINUE INTO TONIGHT AS THE CWA WILL BE ON 
THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW. ANY PRECIPITATION THAT OCCURS TODAY AND 
TONIGHT WILL BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE SO WILL ALLOW THE FLOOD WATCH TO 
EXPIRE WITH THIS PACKAGE.

AN UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH BY FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS 
WILL ALLOW FOR DRY AND PLEASANT CONDITIONS TO OCCUR FOR MUCH OF THE 
WEEKEND ACROSS THE CWA. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE MID TO 
UPPER 70S WITH LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S DURING THIS TIME.

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE BY SUNDAY AS THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM BEGINS TO APPROACH THE AREA. EXPECT RAIN CHANCES TO HOLD OFF 
UNTIL LATE SUNDAY NIGHT. THE SYSTEM WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE OUT OF THE 
REGION SO CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR THROUGH 
THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. RIGHT NOW...THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN 
OUT OF THIS TIME PERIOD WILL OCCUR MONDAY NIGHT AS THE WARM FRONT 
PUSHES NORTHWARD OVER THE CWA.

.UPDATE...
UPPER LOW SPINNING OVER ERN OK THIS MORNING. FIRST BAND OF 
CONVECTION MOVING SLOWLY OUT OF W TN AND NE MS. MEANWHILE AN 
EAST-WEST BAND OF STRONG STORMS ARE FIRING ACRS NW MS ATTM. THIS 
LINE SEEMS TO BE DEVELOPING ALONG A WARM FRONT THAT IS PUSHING NORTH 
THROUGH THE DELTA. DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE MID 60S SOUTH OF THE FRONT 
AND THE MID 50S TO THE NORTH. THERE HAVE BEEN REPORTS OF SMALL HAIL 
WITH THESE STORMS. THIS CONVECTION WL CONTINUE TO PUSH OFF TO THE 
NORTH DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE MORNING/EARLY AFTN. 

THE UPPER LOW WL PUSH SLOWLY INTO WRN AR THIS AFTN WHILE A DRY SLOT 
TRIES TO WORK INTO THE MID SOUTH. BIG QUESTION WL BE THE AMOUNT 
CLOUDINESS AND WHETHER SOME OF THE LOW CLOUDS MIX OUT. STILL FEEL 
SOME SUNSHINE IS POSSIBLE THIS AFTN AND SFC TEMPS SHOULD CLIMB 
ABOVE 70 DEGREES. THIS COMBINED WITH COLD AIR ALOFT MOVING INTO THE 
REGION WL STEEPEN LAPSE RATES AND CREATE DECENT INSTABILITY. 
SBCAPES SHOULD REACH 1500 J/KG THIS AFTN ACRS E CNTRL AR. SHOULD SEE 
REDEVELOPMENT ACRS AR LATER THIS AFTN MOVING ACRS THE MID SOUTH 
DURING THE EARLY EVENING HOURS. BEST SFC BASED INSTABILITY WL BE 
SOUTH OF THE SFC LOW TRACK...ACRS E CNTRL AR AND N MS. THAT AREA 
PROBABLY HAS THE BEST CHANCE OF LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS LATE 
THIS AFTN AND EVENING. SVR WX IS ALSO POSSIBLE ACRS W TN AND NE AR 
THOUGH IT MAY BE MORE ELEVATED IN NATURE WITH LARGE HAIL THE MAIN 
THREAT. THINKING THAT THREAT WL EXTEND WELL INTO THE EVENING. 

WL MAKE A COUPLE SMALL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ZONES...WL KNOCK A COUPLE 
DEGREES OFF THE HIGH TEMPS AND ADJUST POPS SLIGHTLY FOR THIS AFTN.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 215 AM...
DYING LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS CURRENTLY MAKING ITS WAY 
INTO WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA THIS MORNING. THIS LINE IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT IS 
CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER OKLAHOMA. EXPECT THIS INITIAL LINE OF 
CONVECTION TO CONTINUE MOVING EASTWARD ACROSS THE CWA TODAY. MODELS 
HAVE SHIFTED THE TRACK OF THE LOW FURTHER SOUTH THAN LAST NIGHTS 
RUN. LOW IS EXPECTED TO TRACK ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI LATER 
TONIGHT. AFTER THE INITIAL LINE OF CONVECTION GOES THROUGH THIS 
MORNING...SOME CLEARING MAY OCCUR. EVEN IF ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF 
SUNSHINE OCCURS...HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL GET MUCH WARMER THAN WHAT 
GUIDANCE IS PREDICTING. WILL GO WITH HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S. 
WITH DAYTIME HEATING...EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO REDEVELOP 
BY THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. SOME OF THESE STORMS COULD BE SEVERE 
WITH LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE PRIMARY THREAT. THE 
BEST CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER TO OCCUR WILL BE ACROSS PORTIONS OF 
EASTERN ARKANSAS AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI...WHERE THE UPPER LOW WILL 
TRACK.

EXPECT SHOWERS AND A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE INTO 
THURSDAY AS UPPER LOW WILL NOT EXIT MIDSOUTH UNTIL MIDDAY THURSDAY. 
ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT OCCUR THURSDAY MORNING SHOULD STAY BELOW 
SEVERE LIMITS AS INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK ACROSS THE AREA. MIDSOUTH 
WILL BE ON BACK SIDE OF LOW BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SOME 
SCATTERED SHOWERS MAY MOVE THROUGH THE AREA DURING THIS TIME.

AN UPPER RIDGE WILL MOVE OVER THE MIDSOUTH BY FRIDAY EVENING AND 
WILL BRING DRY AND PLEASANT CONDITIONS FOR MOST OF THE WEEKEND TO 
THE MIDSOUTH. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE LOWER TO MID 70S AND LOWS WILL BE 
IN THE 50S DURING THIS TIME.

BY SUNDAY CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA IN ADVANCE 
OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. RAIN CHANCES WILL BEGIN ACROSS 
SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE EXACT TRACK 
OF THE LOW IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME BUT THE MIDSOUTH WILL CONTINUE 
TO EXPERIENCE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE 
BEGINNING OF THE WEEK.

CONVECTION TO CONTINUE MOVING EASTWARD ACROSS THE CWA TODAY. MODELS 
HAVE SHIFTED THE TRACK OF THE LOW FURTHER SOUTH THAN LAST NIGHTS 
RUN. LOW IS EXPECTED TO TRACK ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI LATER 
TONIGHT. AFTER THE INITIAL LINE OF CONVECTION GOES THROUGH THIS 
MORNING...SOME CLEARING MAY OCCUR. EVEN IF ONLY A LITTLE BIT OF 
SUNSHINE OCCURS...HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL GET MUCH WARMER THAN WHAT 
GUIDANCE IS PREDICTING. WILL GO WITH HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S. 
WITH DAYTIME HEATING...EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO REDEVELOP 
BY THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. SOME OF THESE STORMS COULD BE SEVERE 
WITH LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE PRIMARY THREAT. THE 
BEST CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER TO OCCUR WILL BE ACROSS PORTIONS OF 
EASTERN ARKANSAS AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI...WHERE THE UPPER LOW WILL 
TRACK.

EXPECT SHOWERS AND A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE INTO 
THURSDAY AS UPPER LOW WILL NOT EXIT MIDSOUTH UNTIL MIDDAY THURSDAY. 
ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT OCCUR THURSDAY MORNING SHOULD STAY BELOW 
SEVERE LIMITS AS INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK ACROSS THE AREA. MIDSOUTH 
WILL BE ON BACK SIDE OF LOW BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SOME 
SCATTERED SHOWERS MAY MOVE THROUGH THE AREA DURING THIS TIME.

AN UPPER RIDGE WILL MOVE OVER THE MIDSOUTH BY FRIDAY EVENING AND 
WILL BRING DRY AND PLEASANT CONDITIONS FOR MOST OF THE WEEKEND TO THE 
MIDSOUTH. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE LOWER TO MID 70S AND LOWS WILL BE IN 
THE 50S DURING THIS TIME.

BY SUNDAY CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA IN ADVANCE 
OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. RAIN CHANCES WILL BEGIN ACROSS 
SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE EXACT TRACK 
OF THE LOW IS UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME BUT THE MIDSOUTH WILL CONTINUE 
TO EXPERIENCE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE 
BEGINNING OF THE WEEK.

821 PM CDT TUE APR 5 2005

.UPDATE...
STRONG AND VERTICALLY STACKED LOW PRESSURE IS LOCATED OVER WESTERN
OK/WESTERN KS THIS EVENING. THIS LOW IS FORECAST TO GRADUALLY MOVE
EAST-SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT. A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD
OF THIS LOW IS MOVING INTO WESTERN AR ATTM...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING JUST AHEAD OF THIS MAIN LINE. THINK
THE MAIN LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MOVING INTO EASTERN AR
AROUND 1 OR 2 AM. HOWEVER...THE THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING AHEAD OF
THIS LINE COULD ARRIVE A COUPLE OF HOURS EARLIER. THE STORMS WILL BE
MOVING INTO A MORE STABLE AIR MASS AS THEY MOVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH...
PARTICULARLY WITH DIURNAL COOLING. THEREFORE...THINK THE TREND WILL
BE FOR A DECREASE IN INTENSITY OF THE STORMS LATER TONIGHT.
HOWEVER...CAN NOT RULE OUT A FEW SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY WITH
LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WIND. 01Z SPC OUTLOOK OF SLIGHT RISK REMAINS
ABOUT THE SAME AS THE EARLIER OUTLOOK FOR OUR AREA...GENERALLY A
SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE SOUTH AND WEST OF A LINE FROM JONESBORO TO
MEMPHIS TO TUPELO.

WILL UPDATE FOR SMALL CHANGES...MAINLY SKY COVER...AND TO REMOVE
POPS FOR MOST AREAS EAST OF THE MS RIVER UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT.


.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 308 PM CDT TUE APR 5 2005

VERY WET PATTERN ABOUT TO SET IN OVER THE AREA. A CLOSED LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. SKIES HAVE
BEEN SLOW TO CLOUD OVER THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO GOOD HEAT OF THE DAY
MIXING. IF SKIES ARENT ALREADY CLOUDY BY NIGHTFALL...THEY SHOULD
QUICKLY CLOUD OVER. KLZK 88D SHOWS SOME LIGHT SHOWERS OVER CENTRAL
ARKANSAS MOVING EASTWARD. THE REFLECTIVITES ARE VERY LIGHT AND
PROBABLY NOT MEASURABLE HOWEVER STILL WARRANT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR
THIS EVENING OVER OUR AREA AS THEY MOVE EASTWARD.

THE MORE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER WILL BE LATER TONIGHT. A LINE OF
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER OKLAHOMA THIS AFTERNOON ALONG THE
DRY LINE. THESE THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE EASTWARD THIS
EVENING THROUGH WESTERN AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS AS A SHORTWAVE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ADVANCES TOWARDS THE REGION.
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD ARRIVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA
ARRIVE AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE BETTER INSTABILITY IS WELL WEST OF THE
REGION. ALSO WITH THE STORMS ARRIVING AFTER MIDNIGHT...DIURNAL
INSTABILITY WILL BE AT A MINIMUM AS WELL. SO THE STORMS SHOULD
WEAKEN AS THEY MOVE ACROSS ARKANSAS AND EXPECT THE LINE TO BECOME
MORE BROKEN IN COVERAGE ACROSS THE AREA. THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK FOR
AREAS WEST OF A LINE FROM JONESBORO TO MEMPHIS TO TUPELO. THE SLIGHT
RISK AREA OVER THE MIDSOUTH IS DUE TO TIMING UNCERTAINTIES IN TERMS
OF WHEN THE LINE WILL BEGIN TO WEAKEN.

BOTH ETA AND GFS HAVE THE TRACK OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM FURTHER
SOUTH THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. THE EXPECTED TRACK WILL BRING IT OVER THE
MIDSOUTH REGION AND THE MODELS ARE SHOWING MAINLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS
THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. SINCE THE AREA WILL NOT BE IN AS
MUCH OF THE WARM SECTOR AS PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED AND CLOUD COVER WILL
BE A FACTOR...THE SEVERE THREAT MAY BE SOMEWHAT LOWER THAN
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. HOWEVER...IF SOME AREAS DO HAPPEN TO GET
SUNSHINE THEN SEVERE POTENTIAL BECOMES MUCH MORE OF A CONCERN WITH
LARGE HAIL/DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE MAIN THREAT.

THE SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE VERY SLOW TO EXIT THE REGION. THIS
WILL KEEP THE THREAT FOR RAIN IN THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING WHEN THE
SYSTEM WILL HAVE MOVED OFF INTO THE CAROLINAS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL
SETTLE IN FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEAKEN. THEN ANOTHER SYSTEM
SIMILAR TO THE CURRENT SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE FOR EARLY NEXT

HIGH PRESSURE IS CURRENTLY LOCATED LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN 
UNITED STATES THIS MORNING. SOME CIRRUS CLOUDS CONTINUE TO MOVE 
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. LATEST SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW SOME LOWER CLOUDS 
DEVELOPING OVER CENTRAL AND WESTERN ARKANSAS OVER THE PAST FEW 
HOURS. EXPECT THESE CLOUDS TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP DURING THE DAY AND 
SPREAD INTO THE MIDSOUTH BY AFTERNOON. WILL GO WITH BECOMING MOSTLY 
CLOUDY WORDING. EVEN WITH THE CLOUDS...EXPECT HIGH TEMPERATURES TO 
RISE INTO THE MID 70S ACROSS THE CWA. 

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. EXPECT A 
LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OUT AHEAD OF THE LOW 
THIS EVENING. THE LINE SHOULD BEGIN TO MOVE INTO WESTERN AREAS OF 
THE CWA AROUND MIDNIGHT. EXPECT THE LINE TO BE DYING BY THE TIME IT 
REACHES THE CWA. HOWEVER SOME THUNDERSTORMS COULD BE SEVERE WITH 
LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE PRIMARY THREATS. CAN/T RULE 
OUT AN ISOLATED TORNADO EITHER AS HELICITY VALUES WILL BE AROUND 300 
M2/S2...HOWEVER CAPE VALUES WILL ONLY BE AROUND 500 J/KG. THE 
WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA REMAINS IN A SLIGHT RISK FOR TONIGHT.

EXPECT SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LINGERING AROUND THE 
AREA WEDNESDAY MORNING. AREA SHOULD THEN SEE A BRIEF BREAK AS THE 
MIDSOUTH MOVES INTO THE DRY SLOT. SOME SUNSHINE COULD OCCUR BY 
AFTERNOON. THIS WILL ONLY HELP THE INSTABILITY INCREASE ACROSS THE 
AREA. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO REDEVELOP DURING THE 
AFTERNOON INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT BEGINS TO MOVE INTO 
THE CWA. SOME THUNDERSTORMS COULD BE SEVERE WITH LARGE 
HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS...AND ISOLATED TORNADOES POSSIBLE. THE ENTIRE 
CWA IS IN A SLIGHT RISK FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

SEVERE THREAT MAY CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY AS THE UPPER LOW WILL 
STILL BE LOCATED OVER THE CWA. HOWEVER THE THREAT WILL EVOLVE INTO 
MORE OF A HAIL THREAT BY THIS TIME. LOW WILL PUSH EAST OF THE 
MIDSOUTH BY THURSDAY EVENING. HOWEVER WILL KEEP CHANCES FOR SHOWERS 
IN FORECAST.

BY FRIDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH AND WILL 
BRING PLEASANT CONDITIONS TO THE AREA THROUGH THE ENTIRE WEEKEND. 
HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL RANGE FROM NEAR 70 TO THE MID 70S DURING THIS 
TIME.

ON MONDAY...ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO APPROACH THE

HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL OF THE MIDSOUTH WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON.
THIS HAS KEPT SKIES CLEAR AND ALLOWED AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES TO
REBOUND INTO THE LOW TO MID 70S AREAWIDE. THIS HIGH PRESSURE WILL
SLIDE SLOWLY EAST OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS UPPER LEVEL
RIDGING BUILDS THROUGH TUESDAY. THIS WILL KEEP DRY WEATHER AND WARM
TEMPERATURES IN PLACE FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEK.

THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TO AFFECT THE MIDSOUTH WEATHER IS
POSITIONED OFF OF THE COAST OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST THIS AFTERNOON.
THIS SHORTWAVE IS PROGGED TO DIG SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE INTERMOUNTAIN
WEST AND INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS STATES BY MID WEEK. AS THIS
SHORTWAVE DIGS IT WILL CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW...SLOW DOWN...AND
CLOSE OFF INTO A DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BY TUESDAY
AFTERNOON IN THE CENTRAL PLAINS. ALSO...BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON A
100 KT UPPER LEVEL JET AND 70 KT MID LEVEL JET WILL EJECT OUT OF THE
BASE OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AS IT CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST TOWARDS
THE AREA. THIS WILL HELP TO INCREASE LARGE SCALE ASCENT AND WIND
SHEAR OVER THE MIDSOUTH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING. IT
WILL ALSO ASSIST IN DEVELOPING A SURFACE LOW OVER KANSAS TUESDAY...
WHICH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES WITH A COLD
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHEAST OF THE LOW...MOVING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH ON
WEDNESDAY.

LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD ALSO INCREASE JUST AHEAD OF THE SURFACE
BOUNDARY...AS A STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET ADVECTS UPPER 50
DEWPOINTS INTO THE AREA BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. EXPECT A LINE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT TUESDAY
NIGHT OVER THE EASTERN PLAINS STATES WITH A LINEAR CONVECTIVE LINE
BEING THE MOST FAVORABLE CONVECTIVE MODE. THIS LINE OF STORMS IS
EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST INTO THE MIDSOUTH BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. SHEAR
PROFILES WILL BE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS BECOMING
SEVERE...BUT IT APPEARS THAT LOW LEVEL FRONTAL CONVERGENCE WILL
BE WEAKENING AND INSTABILITY MAY BE AT A DIURNAL MINIMUM WHEN THE
LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS MOVES ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AROUND
SUNRISE WEDNESDAY. SOME REINTENSIFICATION MAY OCCUR AS THE LINE
CONTINUES EAST THROUGH EASTERN SECTIONS BY AFTERNOON AS SOME DAYTIME
HEATING ENHANCES INSTABILITY OVER THESE AREAS.

BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPEARS TO BECOME
OCCLUDED. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS THE AREA
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. AS COLDER MID LEVEL TEMPERATURES
ADVECT OVER THE AREA...EXPECT MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES TO STEEPEN AND
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE INTO THE DAY
THURSDAY. COOLER TEMPERATURES CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED FOR THURSDAY AND
FRIDAY.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN FOR THE WEEKEND WITH DRIER WEATHER
AND WARMING TEMPERATURES.

DEEP UPPER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES THIS
AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST. AS THIS OCCURS...UPPER LEVEL
HEIGHTS WILL CONTINUE TO RISE AS UPPER RIDGING BUILDS OVER THE
MIDSOUTH. WEAK UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE
AREA THROUGH NEXT TUESDAY. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE NOW
CENTERED OVER EAST TEXAS WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE EAST AND BE LOCATED
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEKEND AND
THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK. AS THE SURFACE HIGH SLIDES EAST...LOW
LEVEL WIND FLOW WILL RETURN BACK TO A INCREASINGLY SOUTHERLY
DIRECTION. LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION WILL BEGIN AGAIN SUNDAY MORNING
AND COMBINED WITH FULL SUN SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM ABOUT
10 DEGREES ABOVE SATURDAY HIGHS. SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE
SUNDAY THROUGH MID WEEK. WITH SEVERAL DAYS OF GOOD SOUTHERLY FLOW
FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO...EXPECT A GRADUAL INCREASE IN HUMIDITY
LEVELS AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. IN
ADDITION...WITH HIGH PRESSURE IN PLACE...DRY CONDITIONS CAN BE
EXPECTED THROUGH TUESDAY.

THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH ANALYZED OFF THE NORTHWEST
U.S. COAST IS FORECAST TO DIG ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS STATES AND
BEGIN TO CUT OFF AS AN DEEP UPPER LEVEL LOW BY WEDNESDAY AS IT
MOVES ACROSS THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS UPPER SYSTEM WILL
HELP TO INDUCE A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL
PLAINS STATES WHICH SHOULD DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH BY
MID WEEK. SEVERAL OF THE FORECAST MODELS HANDLE THE TIMING OF THIS
SYSTEM A BIT DIFFERENTLY...WITH THE 12Z GFS/CANADIAN FASTER WITH THE
TIMING OF THE FRONT (TUESDAY NIGHT-WEDNESDAY TIME PERIOD) WITH THE
12Z ETA/EUROPEAN/UKMET BETWEEN 12-24 HOURS SLOWER (WEDNESDAY NIGHT-
THURSDAY MORNING). AT THIS TIME...STILL FAVOR THE SLOWER SOLUTIONS
AND EXPECT FRONTAL PASSAGE WEDNESDAY EVENING. THINK THAT WITH THE
UPPER TROUGH CUTTING OFF INTO AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE...THIS
TREND FAVORS A SLOWER SYSTEM PROGRESSION.

AS THIS FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE AREA...EXPECT SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT...PRIMARILY ON
WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN
IS EXPECTED (IE. THREE DAYS PRIOR WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW FROM THE GULF
OF MEXICO) AND WITH STRENGTHENING WIND FIELDS...THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD
BECOME INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE AND SUPPORTIVE OF POSSIBLE SEVERE
WEATHER. WITH THE STORM SYSTEM STILL SEVERAL DAYS OUT...THERE WILL
BE PLENTY OF TIME TO REFINE STORM INTENSITY ISSUES.

AFTER THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH...LINGERING SHOWERS AND COOLER
TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED AS THE TRAILING UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS
THE MIDSOUTH. THIS UPPER LOW WILL MOVE EAST OF THE REGION BY FRIDAY
WITH DRY WEATHER AND WARMING TEMPERATURES EXPECTED INTO NEXT
WEEKEND.

LARGE AND DEEP UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM LOCATED OVER EAST
TENNESSEE THIS MORNING WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST. HIGH PRESSURE HAS
SETTLED OVER MOST OF THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING AND THIS WILL ALLOW
FOR A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY OVER MOST AREAS. THE ONLY EXCEPTION WILL BE
OVER FAR EASTERN SECTIONS...WHERE A FEW CLOUDS MAY PERSIST INTO
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN COOL TODAY UNDER
NORTHWEST FLOW AT ALL LEVELS AND CONTINUED WEAK LOW LEVEL COLD AIR
ADVECTION. LOOKING AT MORNING SOUNDINGS...WE SHOULD MIX UP TO ABOUT
5 KFT. THIS COMBINED WITH FULL SUN WILL ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURES TO
MAX OUT AROUND 60 DEGREES AROUND THE MEMPHIS AREA...WITH UPPER 50S
NORTHEAST SECTIONS AND LOW 60S OVER SOUTHWEST AREAS. THIS MIXING WILL
ALSO ALLOW FOR GUSTY WINDS OVER THE AREA TODAY...ESPECIALLY OVER
EASTERN AREAS WHERE THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL REMAIN TIGHTER. WINDS
WILL GRADUALLY DIMINISH IN INTENSITY FROM WEST TO EAST LATER THIS
AFTERNOON...AS THE UPPER LOW PULLS FURTHER AWAY. LOOKED AT CRITERIA
FOR WIND ADVISORY...BUT APPEARS WINDS WILL STAY JUST BELOW THRESHOLD
CRITERIA...SO NOT ANTICIPATING AN ADVISORY AT THIS TIME.

OTHERWISE...ALL OTHER FORECAST PARAMETERS LOOK GOOD. WILL SEND
UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONES TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING. UPDATES WILL BE

THESE FEATURES WILL PROVIDE THE MIDSOUTH WITH A MILD DAY AND LOTS
OF SUNSHINE.

THE RIDGE WILL MOVE ON INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND ALABAMA BY
SUNDAY EVENING. LOOK FOR SUNDAY TO BE WARM AND MOSTLY SUNNY.

WEATHER FEATURES WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE QUICKLY EAST AND LET
ANOTHER RAIN MAKING FRONT INTO THE MIDSOUTH BY WEDNESDAY. CHANCES

ECHOES SHOWING UP ON RADAR ARE MID-LEVEL CLOUDS...PERHAPS WITH
A SPRINKLE OR TWO. H5 LOW OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST IS FORECAST TO
DIG SOUTHEAST TOWARD MIDDLE TN BY 12Z SAT. WILL LEAVE IN A 20 PERCENT
CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN OVERNIGHT ALONG AND NORTHEAST OF A TIPTONVILLE

CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE LESS THAN 20 PERCENT ELSEWHERE. OTHERWISE
DRIER AIR...SURFACE AND ALOFT...WILL BE SPREADING INTO THE MIDSOUTH.

ISSUED 330 PM CST FRI APR 1 2005

AFTER AN ACTIVE MIDDLE OF THE DAY ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST
MISSISSIPPI...THE WEATHER IS FINALLY STARTING TO QUIET DOWN.
LATEST SFC ANALYSIS DEPICTS THE SURFACE LOW NEAR HUNTSVILLE AS IT
CONTINUES ITS NORTHEASTWARD TREK. ALL OF THE MIDSOUTH IS NOW UNDER
A NW SFC FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW...ALLOWING LOWER
DEWPOINTS TO ENTER THE REGION. ALOFT...500MB LOW NOW OVER
NORTHWEST ARKANSAS MOVING EAST.

FOR TONIGHT...BACK EDGE OF THE MAIN AREA OF PRECIP EXITING THE
AREA AS THE SFC LOW MOVES FURTHER EAST. WILL LEAVE SMALL POPS IN
THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR EXITING PRECIP AND ANY
ISOLATED SHOWERS THE COLD CORE PRODUCES. ANYTHING THAT FALLS WILL
BE VERY LIGHT. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR IN EARNEST AFTER 06Z.
OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE NOTICEABLY COLDER HOWEVER AS STRONG 850MB
COLD AIR ADVECTION USHERS IN 850 TEMPS OF 0 TO -2. THIS WILL HELP
LOWS TO DROP LOWS INTO THE UPPER 30S ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA.

THE SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY TIME FRAME WILL BE VERY TRANQUIL AS AN

FEW DEGREES EACH DAY AS WARM AIR ADVECTION INCREASES AND SOUTHERLY
WINDS SETUP WITH THE SFC HIGH MOVING OFF TO THE EAST. SKIES WILL
BE ABUNDANT WITH SUNSHINE.

MODELS IN AGREEMENT THAT ANOTHER POTENT SHORTWAVE WILL AFFECT THE
REGION SOMETIME LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. AS ALWAYS THIS
FAR OUT...THERE ARE QUESTIONS REGARDING THE TIMING. THE GFS IS THE
QUICKEST OF THE MODELS...BRINGING A COLD FRONT PASSAGE BY 12Z
WEDNESDAY. THE CANADIAN/UKMET/EURO BRING THE FRONT THROUGH MID TO
LATE AFTERNOON ON WEDNESDAY. GIVEN THAT ALL OF THE MODELS BEGIN TO
CLOSE THE SHORTWAVE OFF AS AN UPPER LOW WOULD GIVE MORE WEIGHT TO
THE SLOWER MODEL SOLUTION...THUS THE FORECAST LEANS MORE TOWARDS
FRONTAL PASSAGE DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. DUE TO DECENT MODEL
AGREEMENT...HAVE LIKELY POPS GOING FOR WEDNESDAY. WILL HAVE TO
WATCH FOR THE POTENTIAL OF STRONG STORMS. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL HAVE
AT LEAST TWO DAYS OF RETURN FLOW AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM TO ALLOW
DEWPOINTS TO RECOVER. HWO ALREADY HAD A MENTION OF A FEW STRONG

THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE CHANCES TODAY AND TONIGHT.

TODAY...SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SOUTHEAST TODAY 
BEFORE STALLING OUT THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI THIS

TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY. EXPECTING SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO GRADUALLY OVERTAKE THE MID SOUTH...ESPECIALLY 
OVERNIGHT. ANALYSIS OF MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATES THE NORTHERN 
SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA MAY TAKE UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT TO 
SATURATE THE LOW LEVELS...WITH PRECIPITATION BEFORE THEN AS VIRGA. 
SOME UNCERTAINTY STILL REMAINS WHETHER ANY SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES LOW PRESSURE ACROSS 
NORTH CENTRAL KANSAS WITH A DRYLINE EXTENDING FROM THE LOW ACROSS 
CENTRAL TEXAS. BEHIND THE DRYLINE...DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE 20S TO 
LOWER 30S...AND UPPER 50 TO LOWER 60 DEWPOINTS ACROSS SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS GRADUALLY TRYING TO SURGE NORTH. INFRARED SATELLITE SHOWING 
AN AREA OF MID/UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS TRAVERSING ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS MORNING...AND FAIRLY PRONOUNCED DRY SLOT ON WATER VAPOR 
UPSTREAM. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS SEVERE 
WEATHER POTENTIAL THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.

TODAY...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER WESTERN KANSAS WILL MOVE NORTHEAST 
INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT AND 
BECOME NEGATIVELY TILTED. 40 KT 850 MB JET WILL SHIFT EAST OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON WITH FAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL DIFLUENCE 
AS FORECAST AREA RESIDES IN LEFT EXIT REGION OF UPPER LEVEL JET. 
SEVERAL PARAMETERS POINT TO A POTENTIAL SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK THIS 
AFTERNOON WITH SURFACE BASED AND MIXED LAYER CAPES OF AT LEAST 2000 
J/KG ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA....7000-500MB LAYER LAPSE 
RATES INCREASING TO 6.5-/7.0 C/KM BY THIS AFTERNOON...850/500 MB 
WINDS ABOVE 20KTS/50KTS...0-6KM BULK SHEAR VALUES AT OR ABOVE 60 
KTS...0-3KM SRH VALUES ABOVE 200 M2/S2...AND FAVORABLE SHEAR 
PROFILE. AGREE AT THIS TIME WITH SPC DAY 1 THOUGHTS AS CAPPING 
INVERSION AT 850 MB SHOULD ERODE BY MID AFTERNOON. CURRENT THINKING 
IS THAT CONVECTION WILL INITIATE AS DISCRETE SUPERCELLS BUT THEN 
GRADUALLY TRANSITION OVER TO A SQUALL LINE /BOW ECHO/ WITH EMBEDDED 
CIRCULATIONS AS WIND PROFILES BECOME MORE DIRECTIONAL AFTER SUNSET. 
TEMPERATURES TODAY SHOULD NOT BE TOO MUCH DIFFERENT FROM YESTERDAY 
WITH INFRARED SATELLITE NOT SHOWING MUCH IN THE WAY OF CLOUD COVER 
UPSTREAM ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS.

TONIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT 
AND WEAKEN. SEVERE THREAT SHOULD DIMINISH ACROSS THE FORECAST FROM NW TO 
SOUTHEAST...ESPECIALLY AFTER 04Z AND TAPERED POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT 
WITH BEST CHANCES MAINLY ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST SECTION OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL DROP INTO THE 50S TO LOWER 
60S.

THURSDAY...SIGNIFICANT MODEL DIFFERENCES BEGIN TO ARISE WITH 
HANDLING OF DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW PRESSURE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS. LATEST NAM RUN TAKING SURFACE LOW ACROSS SOUTHERN 
LOUISIANA/MISSISSIPPI THURSDAY AFTERNOON/THURSDAY NIGHT ALONG OLD 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WHILE GFS HAS BEEN MORE CONSISTENT BRINGING SURFACE 
LOW ACROSS CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI BY THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL LEAN TOWARD 
GFS SOLUTION FOR THURSDAY AND BEYOND AT THIS TIME. AS A 
RESULT...THINK SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL IF ANY WILL BE LIMITED TO 
THE SOUTHERN TIER OR TWO OF COUNTIES AT BEST WITH MIXED LAYER CAPES 
AROUND 700 J/KG AND MODERATELY STEEP 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES 
AROUND 6.5 C/KM WITH CONVECTION LIKELY REMAINING ELEVATED WITH 
STABLE LOW LAYER.

THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS CENTRAL 
MISSISSIPPI WITH PRECIPITATION CHANCES INCREASING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH FRIDAY. MADE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO POPS FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT BASED UPON CURRENT MODEL TRENDS AND RAISED POPS UP 
FOR FRIDAY AS WRAP AROUND MOISTURE LIKELY TO AFFECT THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY.

PLENTY OF HIGH CLOUDS SPILLING INTO THE REGION AS UPPER RIDGE MOVES 
OFF TO THE EAST AND A STRONG SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
SFC/UPPER LOW TRACKS TO NE KS BY 12Z WED WITH CDFNT STRETCHING SOUTH 
THROUGH ERN OK INTO NE TX. RETURN FLOW STRENGTHENS TONIGHT AS 
DEWPOINTS...CURRENTLY IN THE 40S...CLIMB TO THE LOWER 50S BY 12Z. 
SFC WINDS SHOULD WL START TO INCREASE AFTER 06Z TONIGHT AS GRADIENT 
STRENGTHENS. FORECAST LOOKS GOOD...MAY NEED TO ADJUST WINDS.

WED EVENING COULD BE INTERESTING. STRONG SFC LOW MOVES NORTH TO IOWA 
WHILE SFC CDFNT PUSHES EAST INTO THE MID SOUTH BY 00Z. SFC DEWPOINTS 
FORECASTED TO CLIMB INTO THE LOWER 60S ACRS N MS AND W TN BY 00Z THU 
WITH SFC BASED CAPES > 1500 J/KG. 115 KT 300 MB JET PUNCHING INTO 
THE REGION WITH 80 KTS AT 500 MB. ALSO...STRONG LOW LEVEL SHEAR EAST 
OF THE FRONT ACRS W TN AND N MS. 00Z MKL ETA SOUNDING HAS 347 M2/S2 
OF HELCITY WITH GOOD VEERING. THERE WILL BE A STRONG CAP EARLY IN 
THE DAY BUT IT SHOULD WEAKEN BY LATE AFTN/EARLY EVENING AS SFC TEMPS 
CLIMB INTO THE UPPER 70S. SFC FRONT AND STRONG SHORTWAVE MOVING INTO 
LOWER/MID MS VALLEY SHOULD PROVIDE ENUF OF A TRIGGER TO KICK OFF 
TSTMS AFTER 00Z THU EAST OF THE MS RIVER. SOME OF THESE STORMS COULD 
BE SEVERE ACRS W TN AND NRN MS 00Z-06Z.

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
ALL THE SIGNIFICANT WEATHER WILL BE IN THE SHORT TERM PORTION OF THE
FORECAST...EVEN WITH THE FIRST 24 HOURS BEING DRY.

UPPER SYSTEM KICKS OUT OF ROCKIES TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH SURFACE
LOW MOVING INTO MINNESOTA BY TOMORROW NIGHT. GFS/NAM DIFFER ON
STRENGTH AND SPEED OF SYSTEM...WITH NAM BEING A LITTLE SLOWER. AS

SLOWS CONSIDERABLY. NAM BRINGS FRONT THROUGH MOST OF THE AREA...
WHILE GFS HANGS IT UP TO OUR WEST. IN FACT...QUICK GLANCE AT 18Z
NAM/ETA INDICATES THAT ENTIRE CWA WOULD BE IN COLD SECTOR FOR THE
ENTIRE EVENT...A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM EARLIER RUNS.

EARLIER FORECASTS WERE BASED ON GFS SOLUTION...AND SEE NO STRONG
REASON TO CHANGE NOW...ESPECIALLY WITH NAM TRACK RECORD RECENTLY.
12Z EURO ALSO SUPPORTS GFS SOLUTION.

WEATHER DRY THROUGH TOMORROW AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH WOULDNT BE SHOCKED
TO SEE A LITTLE GULF STRATUS AND MAYBE A SPRINKLE IN THE MORNING.  AS
UPPER JET SPLITS OVER NORTHERN MS TOMORROW NIGHT...CHANCE OF
CONVECTION THERE WITH UPPER DIVERGENCE. ELEVATED CONVECTION COULD
PRODUCE HAIL TOMORROW NIGHT. POPS WILL RANGE FROM DRY WEST OF
MISSISSIPPI RIVER TO LIKELY SOUTHEAST PORTION OF CWA. A RELATIVE LULL
DURING THE DAY THURSDAY WITH CHANCE POPS. WITH FRONT IN AREA THURSDAY
NIGHT...AND IMPULSE MOVING THROUGH...LIKELY POPS ALL AREAS. GFS
SOLUTION INDICATES PARAMETERS VERY CONDUCIVE FOR SEVERE WEATHER...NAM
SAYS LITTLE OR NO SEVERE WEATHER. WITH MODEL DIVERGENCE...WILL KEEP
MENTION OF SEVERE IN HWO...BUT NOT ZONES. CHANCE POPS FRIDAY AS
SYSTEM MOVES EAST.

TEMPERATURE FORECAST BASED ON GFS FOR MOST PART...BUT NOT
COMFORTABLE WITH HIGH TEMPERATURE FORECAST FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.
WHILE CURRENT FORECAST FITS WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES...EXPECT
TEMPERATURES TO BE A COUPLE OF CATEGORIES HIGHER OR LOWER DEPENDING
ON WHICH MODEL VERIFIES.

THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH NEXT COLD FRONT LOCATED ACROSS THE 
PLAINS. LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING CIRRUS SHIELD WITH 
NEXT SYSTEM BEGINNING TO OVERTAKE THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS CONVECTIVE 
POTENTIAL TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. 

TODAY...PLEASANT DAY EXPECTED TODAY AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BUILD IN THE MID SOUTH. 850 MB TEMPERATURES WILL 
INCREASE TO AROUND 13-14C BY 00Z WEDNESDAY SUGGESTING HIGHS IN THE 
LOWER 80S. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE MIXING HEIGHTS AROUND 3000 FT BY 
THIS AFTERNOON ALONG WITH SOME HIGH CIRRUS PASSING THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY AS SUPPORTED BY WATER VAPOR/INFRARED 
SATELLITE TRENDS THIS MORNING. CURRENT HIGH TEMPERATURE GRIDS 
HANDLING TEMPERATURES WELL TODAY WITH HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE 70S TO 
AROUND 80.

TONIGHT...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL TRANSLATE EAST AS NEXT LONGWAVE 
TROUGH EJECTS OUT OF THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE 
MID/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. TROUGH IN SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL 
PASS JUST NORTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AS IT RIDES UP THE 
RIDGE. SOME MID LEVEL FORCING /700-500MB Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE/ WILL 
BE PRESENT WITH THE NEGATIVELY TILTED TROUGH...BUT A CAPPING 
INVERSION AT 925MB AND RATHER DRY MID LEVELS WILL KEEP THE FORECAST 
AREA DRY OVERNIGHT. SOUTHERLY WINDS IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL 
INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT TO AROUND 40KTS BUT INVERSION NEAR 
SURFACE WILL KEEP GUSTS BELOW 20KTS DURING THE NIGHT.

WEDNESDAY...RIDGING WILL RE-ESTABLISH ITSELF TEMPORARILY ACROSS THE 
LOWER/MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AS TROUGH MOVES INTO GREAT LAKES 
REGION AND NEXT UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES. 700-500 MB MID LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES WILL BE STEEP AT OR ABOVE 7.0 C/KM...WITH LI/S AROUND 
-5...SURFACE BASED CAPES AVERAGING 1100 J/KG...AND A NEARLY 
UNIDIRECTIONAL PROFILE. THIS WOULD SUPPORT A MENTION OF 
THUNDERSTORMS...BUT A CAPPING INVERSION PRESENT AT 900 MB SHOULD 
KEEP CONVECTION FROM INITIATING. 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO 15C 
SUPPORTING HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S. INCREASING CLOUDS 
SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 70S TO AROUND 80. NO CHANGES 
TO HIGH TEMPERATURES WITH GRIDS REFLECTING THINKING WELL. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE WITH HANDLING OF WEAK 
IMPULSE IN SOUTHWEST FLOW AS WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY PASSES ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WHILE NEXT TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND DEVELOPS SURFACE LOW PRESSURE. FORECAST AREA 
WILL BE IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF UPPER LEVEL JET...RESULTING 
IN UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 
1000J/KG OF CAPE...LI/S AROUND -4...AND FAVORABLE WIND PROFILE 
JUSTIFY CURRENT POPS. MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL REMAIN ELEVATED WITH HAIL AS THE PRIMARY THREAT. 

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE THROUGH ARKANSAS 
DURING THE DAY. NAM MUCH STRONGER WITH INSTABILITY PARAMETERS THAN 
GFS. NONETHELESS...LI/S OF AT LEAST -6...CAPES 2000 J/KG...0-6KM 
BULK SHEAR VALUES ABOVE 40KTS...AND SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE WIND 
PROFILE...AND 700-500MB MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES BECOMING MODERATELY 
STEEP AROUND 6.5 C/KM SUPPORT MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS. THINK THAT 
BEST SEVERE POTENTIAL WOULD BE MOSTLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF 
THE FORECAST AREA IN THE WARM SECTOR...THOUGH ALL OF FORECAST AREA 
IN DAY 3 SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS.  SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
WILL DEPART TO THE NORTHEAST ON FRIDAY WITH WRAP AROUND MOISTURE 
PRODUCING RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE REGION.

THE UPPER LOW THAT BROUGHT HEAVY RAINS TO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...THE 
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND PARTS OF WEST TENNESSEE WAS SPINNING OVER 
CENTRAL TENNESSEE THIS MORNING. WRAP AROUND SHOWERS WERE AFFECTING 
ALL OF WEST TENNESSEE...THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI. THIS UPPER LOW WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT FARTHER EAST TAKING 
THE WRAP AROUND RAIN WITH IT. TIMING OF RAIN MOVING EAST OF THE TN 
RIVER IS AROUND NOON...OTHERWISE SKIES WILL GRADUALLY CLEAR FROM 
WEST TO EAST TODAY.

WEATHER BECOMES TRANQUIL AS A MID LEVEL RIDGE TRANSLATES ACROSS THE 
EAST CENTRAL U.S. A STRONG SHORTWAVE MOVING OUT OF THE CENTRAL 
ROCKIES ON TUESDAY WILL SWING ACROSS MISSOURI AND INTO ILLINOIS 
WEDNESDAY. ANY RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM SHOULD REMAIN NORTH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY. 

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVING OUT OF THE CENTRAL U.S. WILL BEGIN TO 
AFFECT THE MID SOUTH WEDNESDAY EVENING. AHEAD OF THIS 
SYSTEM...ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL OCCUR DUE TO THE 
40+KT LOW LEVEL JET. NOT EXPECTING ANY RAINFALL WEDNESDAY...HOWEVER 
THIS WILL PRIME THE ATMOSPHERE FOR THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ON 
THURSDAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM MOVES CLOSER. IN ADDITION 
TO THE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY BEING IN PLACE...CURRENT MODELS 
AGREE ON THE POSITION OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY BISECTING THE MID 
SOUTH BY THURSDAY NIGHT. FEELING IS THAT THIS WILL BE SOMETHING TO 
WATCH THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AS FAR AS SEVERE POTENTIAL. IT APPEARS 
THAT THE SPEED OF THIS SYSTEM WILL DRAG THE PRECIP OUT OF THE AREA 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON FOLLOWED BY MUCH COOLER AIR. NEXT WEEKEND SHOULD BE

THE SURFACE LOW WAS LOCATED JUST SOUTH OF TUPELO THIS MORNING. GUSTY 
NORTH WINDS WERE OCCURRING ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...THE MISSOURI 
BOOTHEEL AND WESTERN TENNESSEE. A LARGE AREA OF RAIN WAS ALSO MOVING 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THIS AREA. SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH A FEW EMBEDDED 
THUNDERSTORMS WERE MOVING ACROSS NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. THE LOCATION 
OF THE SURFACE LOW AND ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT DID NOT MAKE IT AS FAR 
NORTH AS WHAT WE WERE THINKING YESTERDAY...THUS THE SEVERE WEATHER 
THREAT WAS DIMINISHED. 

HOWEVER...THE UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM LOCATED OVER CENTRAL TEXAS 
WAS MOVING CLOSER TO THE MID SOUTH. ANOTHER BATCH OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE ENTIRE MID SOUTH BY THIS AFTERNOON. 
THE TRACK OF THE UPPER LOW WILL TAKE IT RIGHT OVER NORTHERN 
MISSISSIPPI OVERNIGHT. STEEP LAPSE RATES ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD 
CORE OF THE UPPER LOW SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE THUNDERSTORMS. 
THERE WILL BE A THREAT OF LARGE HAIL WITH THE STRONGER STORMS. 

THIS SYSTEM WILL EXIT WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI BY 
LATE MORNING MONDAY. SKIES WILL CLEAR AND TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON 
THE REBOUND BACK TO NEAR SEASONAL MONDAY. EXPECT EVEN WARMER DAYTIME 
TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY. 

NO CHANGES MADE TO THE LONG RANGE FORECAST THIS EVENING. FORECAST

A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER ARKANSAS STRETCHING FROM THE 
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL TO LITTLE ROCK. THE AREAS OF SHOWERS WERE MOVING 
NORTHEAST AT 30 MPH. THESE RAIN SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED ALONG THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE 130KT JET WHICH WAS ROUGHLY LOCATED FROM THE 
BIG BEND OF TEXAS TO HUNTSVILLE AL. MORE IMPRESSIVE THUNDERSTORMS 
HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE PERMIAN BASIN AND ROLLING PLAINS OF TEXAS. 
THIS ACTIVITY EXPLODED IN ADVANCE OF THE STRONG UPPER LOW MOVING OUT 
OF NEW MEXICO. THE MID SOUTH WILL HAVE TO DEAL WITH THIS STORM 
SYSTEM LATER TODAY AND SUNDAY.

TODAY THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT HAS SET UP ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF 
OF MISSISSIPPI WILL PLAY HAVOC WITH THE FORECAST. CURRENT MODELS 
AGREE THAT LATER THIS AFTERNOON THE CHANCES FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS 
INCREASE. THE IMPRESSIVE UPPER LEVEL JET AND THE SHEAR PROFILES 
WOULD SUPPORT STRONG UPDRAFTS. THE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTHWARD 
THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT AS THE SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS OVER 
LOUISIANA AND DEEPENS OVER NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI TONIGHT. ANY STORMS 
THAT DEVELOP IN THE WARM SECTOR I.E. SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT AND 
MOVE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE BOUNDARY WILL HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF 
PRODUCING A TORNADO. NORTH OF THE WARM FRONT...ROTATING STORMS WILL 
PRODUCE LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS. EXPECT THE EVOLUTION OF 
STORMS TO BEGIN MOVING INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS LATE THIS AFTERNOON 
WITH OTHER STORMS DEVELOPING NEAR THE WARM FRONT IN NORTHERN 
MISSISSIPPI. THE STORMS WILL PERSIST FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE EVENING 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTH AND EASTERN FORECAST AREAS.

AS THE UPPER LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY...WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR DUE TO THE INSTABILITY PROVIDED 
BY THE COLD CORE LOW. EXPECT THE RAIN TO END LATE SUNDAY/EARLY 
MONDAY. PLEASANT WEATHER WILL RETURN TO THE AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 

ANOTHER STRONG STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND 
AFFECT THE MID SOUTH THURSDAY AND POSSIBLY INTO FRIDAY. THIS SYSTEM 
COULD PRODUCE ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER. STAY TUNED FOR THIS 
ONE.

SKIES REMAIN MOSTLY SUNNY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON.
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY REMAIN DRAPED ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH THIS
AFTERNOON AND HAS PRODUCED NO THUNDERSTORMS SO FAR. IT APPEARS IT
WILL TAKE UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT TO SEE ANY CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AS
WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH OVERNIGHT. WILL ONLY KEEP 20 POPS IN THE
FORECAST AFTER MIDNIGHT. CONDITIONS SHOULD GRADUALLY WORSEN AS TIMES
GOES ON SATURDAY. BY SATURDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVES
THROUGH THE REGION. IN ADDITION...UPPER LEVEL PULLS ACROSS THE TEXAS
PANHANDLE AND HELPS DEVELOP A SURFACE LOW OVER NORTHWEST LOUISIANA.
ALL OF THESE FACTORS WILL HELP PRODUCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
DURING THE DAY SATURDAY. HAVE REDUCED POPS TO LIKELY CATEGORY FOR
SATURDAY. SATURDAY NIGHT COULD BE A BUSY NIGHT DEPENDING ON TRACK OF
THE SURFACE LOW. RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT THE BULK OF THE WORST
SEVERE WEATHER SHOULD REMAIN TO THE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA BUT
ANY NORTHWARD CHANGE IN THE TRACK OF THE LOW COULD MEAN A BETTER
CHANCE OF SEVERE STORMS FOR THE FORECAST AREA. BY SUNDAY SURFACE
LOW SHOULD BE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BUT CANT COMPLETELY RULE

ONGOING CONVECTION OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS PROGRESSING TOWARD THE MID 
SOUTH THIS MORNING. OUTFLOW WAS WELL AHEAD OF THE STORMS. WEAKER 
SHOWERS WERE OCCURRING ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WHILE THERE ARE 
STILL A FEW DISTINCT STRONG CELLS LOCATED BEHIND THE OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARY. THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM 
THIS COMPLEX MAY PRODUCE SOME MEASURABLE RAINFALL OVER THE WESTERN 
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA MAINLY THIS MORNING. 

LIGHTER SHOWERS OVER THE CENTRAL FORECAST AREA WERE MOVING EASTWARD 
AT A GOOD PACE. THERE MAY BE SOME ENHANCEMENT OVER THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS BUT THIS WILL BE SHORT LIVED. EXPECT MOST OF THE RAIN ACTIVITY 
TO END BY 9 AM.

FORECAST MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATING RATHER WEAK LIFT LATER THIS 
MORNING THROUGH OVERNIGHT. MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE NOT THAT 
IMPRESSIVE UNTIL LATER TONIGHT OVER THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA WOULD BE THE BEST BET FOR ANY STORMS TO 
DEVELOP.

THE STRONG SOUTHWEST FLOW OF THE SUBTROPICAL JET WILL PROVIDE 
SUPPORT TO THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT ON SATURDAY. A BOUNDARY WILL 
BISECT THE MID SOUTH SATURDAY. AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE A 
GOOD POSSIBILITY ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI...JUST SOUTH 
OF THE BOUNDARY. SATURDAY NIGHT...THE UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS WILL APPROACH THE MID SOUTH. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
LIKELY ENVELOPE THE AREA AS ALL THE INGREDIENTS NECESSARY WILL BE 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE DAY SUNDAY. BY SUNDAY EVENING THE

TODAY...MODEL SOUNDINGS AND SATELLITE TRENDS INDICATE THAT CLOUDS 
WILL STILL STICK AROUND THE MID SOUTH TODAY. AS THE LOW CLOUDS 
GRADUALLY DEPART DURING THE DAY MID/UPPER LEVEL CLOUDINESS WILL 
OVERTAKE THE FORECAST AREA AND ONLY EXPECT PARTLY SUNNY SKIES BY

HIGHS IN THE 60S TO AROUND 70. 
 
TONIGHT...WARM FRONT CURRENTLY ACROSS THE PANHANDLE OF TEXAS IS 
FORECAST TO REACH THE MID SOUTH BY FRIDAY MORNING. 700-500 MB MID 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL STEEPEN TO AROUND 7 C/KM BY FRIDAY MORNING 
WITH ASSISTANCE FROM A 850MB LOW LEVEL JET THAT WILL DEVELOP 
OVERNIGHT. LI/S UP TO AROUND -5...CAPES AROUND 1000 J/KG ACROSS 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WITH LESSER INSTABILITY TO THE EAST...AND 700 MB 
DRY AIR UPSTREAM SUGGEST THUNDERSTORMS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION. 
HOWEVER I THINK THAT ANY CONVECTION WILL REMAIN ELEVATED WITH HAIL 
AS A POTENTIAL SEVERE WEATHER THREAT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE 
AMPLE LOW LEVEL DRY AIR WILL BE IN PLACE AT THE START OF THE EVENING 
AND WILL HOLD OFF BETTER PRECIPITATION CHANCES UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
LOW TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY DROP INTO THE 50S WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION 
INCREASING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 

FRIDAY...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING THE 
DAY...MOVING AS FAR AS THE TN/MS STATE LINE BEFORE STALLING OUT 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. BOTH NAM/GFS ADVERTISE THE AREA DRY 
SLOTTING FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE PRECIPITATION TRIES TO ARRIVE AGAIN 
BY LATE AFTERNOON. A SURFACE BASED PARCEL (74/61) BASED NEAR KMEM 
PRODUCES 2000 J/KG OF CAPE...LI/S AROUND -6. THIS WOULD BE IDEAL FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS...HOWEVER MID LEVEL FORCING WILL BE WEAK AT BEST IN 
THE AFTERNOON WITH 700-500 MB LAPSE RATES WEAKENING TO UNDER 6 
C/KM...AND WILL LIKELY BE THE MISSING INGREDIENT. AS A RESULT...ONLY 
CARRYING SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE AFTERNOON. ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT 
CAN DEVELOP COULD PRODUCE SOME HAIL...BUT EXPECTING ANY 
THUNDERSTORMS TO REMAIN BELOW SEVERE LIMITS AT THIS TIME. 850 MB 
TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO AROUND 13C...SUPPORTING HIGHS INTO THE 
MIDDLE 70S.  

FRIDAY NIGHT...STALLED OUT FRONT WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
WHILE ANOTHER SHORTWAVE IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT PRODUCES ANOTHER 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH 700-500MB LAPSE RATES 
INCREASING TO AROUND 6.5 C/KM. 

SATURDAY...A SECONDARY SURFACE LOW WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS AND MOVE INTO THE MID SOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY 
BRINGING ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA SATURDAY 
AND SATURDAY NIGHT...AND RAIN SHOWERS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW ON 
SUNDAY.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...LATEST 00Z LONG RANGE MODEL RUN QUICKER 
THAN 12Z RUN WITH MOVEMENT OF LONGWAVE TROUGH ACROSS THE U.S. BY 
WEDNESDAY.  ZONAL FLOW ADVERTISED IN PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS HAS 
TRANSITIONED OVER TO A SOUTHWEST FLOW PATTERN. LATEST GFS RUN 
SHOWING A NEGATIVELY TILTED TROUGH TO MOVE ACROSS THE MIDDLE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY...WHICH IS DIFFERENT FROM 
THE 12Z RUN. LATEST EUROPEAN RUN A BIT MORE AMPLIFIED THAN GFS AND 
SLOWER WITH UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN 
SHOWERS TO TUESDAY NIGHT AS NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES BUT WILL NOT 
RAISE POPS AT THIS TIME TO FURTHER PERIODS UNTIL LATER RUNS SHOW 
MORE RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY.

400 AM CST WED MAR 23 2005

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING CENTERS SURFACE 
LOW PRESSURE ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE WITH OCCLUDED FRONT EXTENDING 
DOWN ACROSS ALABAMA TO THE GULF OF MEXICO. MEANWHILE UPPER LEVEL LOW 
SPINNING ACROSS ROLLA MISSOURI AND SPREADING STRATO CUMULUS ACROSS 
THE MID/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEYS. DRY SLOT ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY 
HAS ALSO SHIFTED EAST WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT LAST NIGHT.

TODAY...MORE TRANQUIL WEATHER EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TODAY AS 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING SLOWLY SHIFTS EAST FROM THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN 
PLAINS. LATEST KNQA 88D RADAR TRENDS SHOWING A FEW LIGHT RETURNS 
JUST WEST OF THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL. MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL SUGGEST 
SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE WILL HANG AROUND THE FAR NORTHERN TIER OF 
COUNTIES THROUGH MID MORNING /ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW SPRINKLES/ BUT 
MID/UPPER LEVELS WILL CONTINUE TO DRY AS SUBSIDENCE TAKES HOLD. WRAP 
AROUND LOW/MID CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL AFFECT 
THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THIS EVENING AND KEEP TEMPERATURES DOWN A 
FEW DEGREES IN THE 50S TO LOWER 60S EVEN THOUGH 850 MB TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE AROUND 2C. 

TONIGHT...SKIES WILL CLEAR OUT ACROSS THE REGION AS UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING CONTINUES TO BUILD IN DURING THE EVENING WITH 1000-500 MB 
LAYER RH/S DROPPING DOWN TO AROUND 45 PERCENT. MOS GUIDANCE MOSTLY 
CONSISTENT WITH LOWS TONIGHT AND ONLY MADE MINOR LOW TEMPERATURE 
ADJUSTMENTS AS PREVIOUS GRID HANDLING TREND WELL. 

THURSDAY...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL MOVE EAST TOWARD THE EAST COAST 
DURING THE DAY AS NEXT SURFACE LOW OVER THE PLAINS BEGINS TO AFFECT 
THE AREA AS EARLY AS THURSDAY EVENING AND THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER VALLEY TRANSITIONS BACK TO A MID/UPPER LEVEL SOUTHWEST FLOW 
PATTERN. AS A RESULT...CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE GRADUALLY 
THROUGH THE DAY WITH HIGHS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA RISING INTO THE 
UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES RISE TO AROUND 14C 
/SUPPORTIVE OF UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S WITH DECENT MIXING AND 
ABUNDANT SUNSHINE/ BY 03Z FRIDAY. I ADJUSTED HIGHS FOR THURSDAY UP A 
COUPLE OF DEGREES BASED ON THIS LATEST TREND.  

THURSDAY NIGHT...NEXT COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE FORECAST 
AREA ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT. SOME ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL BE PRESENT 
ALONG WITH STEEP 700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AROUND 7 
C/KM...BUT NOT INCLINED AT THIS POINT TO RAISE POPS ABOVE SLIGHT 
CHANCE WITH MOISTURE STILL BEING LIMITED WITH THIS FRONT. THUNDER 
CHANCES STILL LOOK REASONABLE WITH CAPES UP TO 1000 J/KG...LI/S 
-4...AND SHOWALTER INDICIES AROUND -2.

FRIDAY...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
BEFORE STALLING OUT BY FRIDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY WITH 
THE BEST CHANCES FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND FRIDAY EVENING AS 700-500 MB 
LAYER LAPSE RATES BECOME MODERATELY STEEP AROUND 6.5 C/KM. AM A BIT 
CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING AS MODEL SOUNDINGS PRODUCE 1000-2000 J/KG OF CAPE...LI/S 
AROUND -5 AND LITTLE IF ANY CAP. THINK THAT SEVERE WEATHER THREATS 
AT THIS POINT WOULD BE PRIMARILY HAIL AND POSSIBLY DAMAGING WINDS AS 
WIND FIELDS ARE NEARLY UNIDIRECTIONAL. BIG QUESTION STILL REMAINS 
HOW MUCH MOISTURE RETURN FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL BE AVAILABLE 
AND THE AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE TO ASSIST SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO MIDDLE 70S ACROSS THE AREA. 
WILL MENTION POSSIBILITY OF STRONG THUNDERSTORMS IN HWO IN DAYS 2-7 
SECTION FOR FRIDAY. 

SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...LONG TERM RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY STILL A 
BIT UNCERTAIN WITH LATEST RUN. BOTH 00Z GFS/EUROPEAN RUN STILL 
ADVERTISING ANOTHER CLOSED LOW TO DEVELOP ACROSS NEW MEXICO BY 
FRIDAY AND MOVE TOWARD THE MID SOUTH BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. 
EUROPEAN STILL A BIT QUICKER THAN GFS BUT BOTH MODELS WITH OVERALL 
SLOWER PROGRESSION OF THE LOW MOVING INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE ALONG THE STALLED FRONT ACROSS THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON SATURDAY PRODUCING ADDITIONAL SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS. SURFACE LOW WILL THEN MOVE OFF INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY/APPALACIANS BY MONDAY WITH WRAP AROUND SHOWERS AFFECTING THE 
MID SOUTH ON EASTER SUNDAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD BACK IN 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AT LEAST FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. THE 
OVERALL UPPER AIR PATTERN ACROSS THE UNITED STATES WILL BE ZONAL 
FLOW WHICH SUGGESTS AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN FOR NEXT WEEK.

SFC WARM FRONT LOCATED FROM SRN AR TO N CNTRL MS AND STARTING TO 
SURGE NORTHWARD. FRONT HAS MOVED PASSED GWO WHERE THE SFC DEWPOINT 
HAS CLIMBED TO 58F. WARM FRONT WL MOVE THROUGH N MS AND INTO W TN 
THIS AFTN. NAM MOVES IT TO NEAR THE KY/TN BORDER BY ABOUT 3 
PM...THIS MAY BE A LITTLE AGGRESSIVE. MID LEVEL DRY PUNCH WORKING 
INTO SW SXNS OF THE CWFA ATTM. QUESTION WL BE HOW MUCH SUNSHINE WL 
THE AREA GET LATE THIS MORNING/EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. SHOULD BE ENUF 
MIXING TO BREAK UP LOW CLOUD COVER ACRS THE DELTA. WITH SFC WARM 
FRONT MOVING NORTH AND POSSIBLE SUNSHINE EXPECT TEMPS TO MOVE TOWARD 
THE 70 DEGREE MARK. ALSO VERY COLD AIR ALOFT MOVING OVER THE REGION 
AS 500 MB LOW MOVES CLOSER THIS AFTERNOON. 500 MB TEMPS OF -21C JUST 
TO THE WEST. THIS WL PRODUCE VERY STEEP LAPSE ACRS THE REGION THIS 
AFTERNOON. SFC BASED CAPES SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT WL APPROACH 
1500-2000 J/KG. 

EXPECT REDEVELOPMENT AROUND 3 PM PROBABLY NEAR THE RIVER...MOVING

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
ACROSS CENTRAL OKLAHOMA WITH WARM FRONT EXTENDING DOWN INTO 
SOUTHWESTERN ARKANSAS AND LOUISIANA. A TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDS 
ACROSS WESTERN TEXAS. CONCERNS FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE WILL FOCUS 
MAINLY ON SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL TODAY AND TONIGHT.

TODAY...BIG QUESTION FOR SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL TODAY WILL BE HOW 
FAR NORTH WARM FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AND AMOUNT OF 
SUNSHINE THE FORECAST AREA SEES TODAY. CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS NOT 
SHOWING MUCH MOVEMENT ON WARM FRONT AS OF YET WHILE SHORT TERM 
MODELS SUGGESTING WARM FRONT REACHING AREAS AS FAR NORTH AS MEMPHIS 
BY 12Z. SURFACE FRONT SHOULD HOPEFULLY START TO MOVE NORTH ACROSS 
THE REGION LATER THIS MORNING. UPPER LEVEL LOW CENTERED ACROSS 
SOUTHERN KANSAS/WESTERN OKLAHOMA WILL MOVE EAST TODAY WITH 850 MB 
WINDS INCREASING TO 35 KTS BY THIS AFTERNOON. UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT 
STILL BEING INDICATED BY MODELS AND 00Z 250MB ANALYSIS WITH UPPER 
LEVEL DIVERGENCE PRESENT AS THE MID SOUTH IS IN THE LEFT EXIT REGION 
OF UPPER LEVEL JET. 88D REGIONAL RADAR TRENDS SHOW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AFFECTING THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING. LATEST INFRARED 
AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWING DRY SLOT TRYING TO WORK ITS WAY EAST 
BEHIND CURRENT CONVECTION. AS A RESULT...WILL SEE A BREAK IN THE 
ACTION BEFORE ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP BY THIS 
AFTERNOON. LATEST MODEL RUNS OF GFS/NAM SUGGESTING THAT ALL OF THE 
FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY BUT SUSPECT THAT AREAS 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI WILL BECOME PARTLY SUNNY 
DURING THE DAY. SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS FOR THIS AFTERNOON LOOK 
RATHER GOOD WITH 0-6KM BULK SHEAR VALUES AT OR ABOVE 40KTS...CAPES 
OF 1100-1800 J/KG...700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS UPSTREAM ABOVE 
5C...AND STEEP 700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AROUND 7 C/KM. 
BACKING SURFACE WINDS ALONG WITH VEERING WIND PROFILE STILL SUGGEST 
SUPERCELL THREAT AT ONSET OF CONVECTION...BUT THINK THAT A 
TRANSITION TO LINEAR CONVECTION WITH BOWING SEGMENTS WILL OCCUR 
TOWARDS EVENING AS WINDS GRADUALLY BECOME MORE UNIDIRECTIONAL BY 
00Z. THAT SAID...THINK BEST POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER TODAY WILL 
BE PRIMARILY ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND THE BORDERING 
TENNESSEE/ARKANSAS COUNTIES. 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO AROUND 
9C BY THIS AFTERNOON...BUT THINK TEMPERATURES WILL REACH AROUND 70 
WHERE LESS CLOUD COVER WILL BE PRESENT. 

TONIGHT...SURFACE COLD FRONT AND MAIN LINE OF CONVECTION WILL PASS 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA DURING FIRST PART OF THE EVENING WITH SOME 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE FROM THE UPPER LEVEL LOW PRODUCING SOME 
RESIDUAL RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH MORNING. LOWS 
WILL DROP DOWN INTO THE 40S. 

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY BECOME PARTLY 
CLOUDY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY AND LOW PRESSURE MOVES OFF TO NEW ENGLAND. 850MB TEMPERATURES 
AROUND 4-5 C WILL SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S AT BEST...BUT WILL 
KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 50S TO MIDDLE 60S WITH SOME CLOUD 
COVER PRESENT. LOWS WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER 40S.

A WARM FRONT EXTEND THROUGH NE TX...LA AND SRN MS/AL. EXPECT THIS 
FRONT TO CONTINUE MOVING NWD LATE TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY. 

LARGE AREA OF LIFT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS IN AREA OF STRONG 
DIFFLUENCE ALOFT. A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE 
TO DEVELOP ACROSS AR/LA. MAINLY SHOWERS OCCURRING OVER WRN TN/NRN MS 
WHERE AIRMASS IS MORE STABLE.

TONIGHT...EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BECOME WIDESPREAD ACRS 
THE MID SOUTH. STRONG JET MOVING AROUND THE BASE OF THE UPPER LOW 
WILL APPROACH THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. THESE WILL HELP PRODUCE LARGE 
AMOUNTS OF LIFT AND PROMOTE PLENTY OF SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT. THE GOOD THING IS THAT SEVERE PARAMETERS DO NOT COME 
TOGETHER TONIGHT. THERE IS A LOT OF SHEAR BUT INSTABILITY IS 
LACKING. THE PRECIP OVERNIGHT SHOULD SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE WARM FRONT 
NORTHWARD. AS A RESULT SFC BASED INSTABILITY WILL BE MEAGER THRU 12Z

HUNDRED JOULES ACRS NRN MS. IF THE WARM FRONT DOES MAKE BETTER 
PROGRESS THAN EXPECTED THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE OF SEVERE WEATHER IN

AN ACTIVE WEATHER PERIOD IS IN STORE FOR THE MIDSOUTH THE NEXT COUPLE
OF DAYS. HOWEVER...MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH WILL REMAIN DRY THIS
MORNING. A WEST TO EAST STATIONARY FRONT ANALYZED BY THE SURFACE
DEWPOINT GRADIENT EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL AR THROUGH NORTH MS INTO NORTH
AL EARLY THIS MORNING. MID-LEVEL CLOUDS ARE EXPANDING OVER THE
MIDSOUTH BUT LOCAL RADARS ARE ECHO FREE. MEANWHILE...A NEGATIVELY
TILTED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND AN ASSOCIATED LOW AT THE SURFACE ARE
MOVING INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THUNDERSTORMS EXTEND FROM KS
SOUTHWARD THROUGH OK AHEAD OF THIS LOW THIS MORNING.

FOR TODAY...THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE SLOWLY EASTWARD
THROUGH OK WHILE THE STATIONARY FRONT LIFTS NORTHEASTWARD AS A WARM
FRONT. EXCELLENT UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE WILL EXIST AHEAD OF THE LOW
WITH STRONG UPPER LEVEL VERTICAL VELOCITIES. A NORTH TO SOUTH BAND
OF OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE ACROSS AR TODAY...MOVING
INTO EASTERN AR THIS AFTERNOON. THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. WHILE SHEAR VALUES / WIND
FIELDS ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE TONIGHT WITH 0-3 KM HELICITY VALUES
REACHING 300 TO 500 M2/S2 ACROSS MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH...INSTABILITY
VALUES ARE MEAGER. CAPE AS SHOWN BY THE NAM ONLY INCREASES TO BETWEEN
200 AND 300 J/KG FROM EAST-CENTRAL AR INTO NORTHWEST MS AFT 06Z.
SURFACE DEWPOINTS ARE ANOTHER LIMITING FACTOR TONIGHT...REACHING
ONLY INTO THE 50S. AS A RESULT...SPC HAS LIMITED A SLIGHT RISK OF
SEVERE FOR TONIGHT TO JUST OUR EXTREME SOUTHWEST COUNTIES...
INCLUDING PARTS OF EAST-CENTRAL AR INTO NORTHWEST MS.

IT NOW APPEARS THAT THE BEST CHANCE OF SEVERE WILL COME TUESDAY INTO
TUESDAY EVENING. THE BAND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT MOVE
THROUGH TONIGHT WILL EXIT EASTERN AREAS TUESDAY MORNING. MEANWHILE...
THE UPPER LEVEL / SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE INTO SOUTHERN MO /
NORTHERN AR TUESDAY. A TRAILING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO EASTERN AR
BY LATE MORNING...THEN MOVE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND
EVENING. VERY UNSTABLE AIR WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH CAPES
FORECAST TO CLIMB TO NEAR 3000 J/KG. THE FORECAST SOUNDING FOR 18Z
FROM THE NAM AT MEM SHOWS A CAPE OF 2904 J/KG...0 TO 3 KM STORM
RELATIVE HELICITY OF 149 M2/S2...A WET BULB ZERO OF 7120 FT...AND A
500 MB TEMPERATURE OF MINUS 19 DEGREES C. THINK THAT LARGE HAIL AND
DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT. HOWEVER...THERE COULD BE
ENOUGH DIRECTIONAL SHEAR FOR ISOLATED TORNADOES...PARTICULARLY WITH
THE WARM FRONT FORECAST TO EXTEND WEST TO EAST JUST NORTH OF THE
MIDSOUTH. SPC HAS PLACED MUCH OF WEST TN AND NORTH MS IN A MODERATE
RISK FOR SEVERE TUESDAY...WITH A SLIGHT RISK ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH.

DRY AND COOLER WEATHER IS FORECAST TO RETURN WEDNESDAY AS HIGH
PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE AREA. WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST.

A VERY WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY ANALYZED OVER NORTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI
AT 03Z WITH PRIMARY STATIONARY FRONT SITUATED ALONG THE GULF COAST.
WEAK UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE CONTINUING TO MOVE ACROSS CENTRAL
MISSISSIPPI THIS EVENING. SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THIS
FEATURE AND ALONG THE VERY WEAK BOUNDARY NOTED IN NORTH-CENTRAL
MISSISSIPPI THIS EVENING. THESE LIGHT SHOWERS SHOULD CLIP MY FAR
SOUTHEAST COUNTIES BEFORE MIDNIGHT. ALSO HAVE LEFT SMALL POPS IN
ACROSS FAR SOUTHERN COUNTIES TONIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY SHOWERS THAT
MAY DEVELOP ALONG SUBTLE BOUNDARY...BUT KEPT POPS LOW AS CONFIDENCE
IS LOW AND WEAK SUBSIDENCE BEHIND DEPARTING SHORTWAVE MAY KEEP PRECIP
FROM DEVELOPING.

AS FOR THE UPCOMING EVENT PROGGED FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...
APPEARS THAT WARM FRONT WILL BE SLOWER TO REACH THE MID SOUTH.
THEREFORE...THINK BEST TIMING FOR ANY SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE AFTER
9 PM MONDAY EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING AS WARM FRONT ADVANCES
ACROSS THE REGION AND MID AND UPPER LEVEL JET EJECTS OUT OF THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS PLACING REGION UNDER STRONGLY DIFFLUENT UPPER
FLOW. SHEAR ALSO INCREASES MARKEDLY LATER MONDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE STILL MAY BE LIMITING FACTOR WITH DELAY OF WARM FRONTAL
PASSAGE. BEST CHANCES FOR SEVERE WEATHER APPEARS OVER AREAS SOUTH

9 PM MONDAY EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING AS WARM FRONT ADVANCES
ACROSS THE REGION AND MID AND UPPER LEVEL JET EJECTS OUT OF THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS PLACING REGION UNDER STRONGLY DIFFLUENT UPPER
FLOW. SHEAR ALSO INCREASES MARKEDLY LATER MONDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE STILL MAY BE LIMITING FACTOR WITH DELAY OF WARM FRONTAL
PASSAGE. BEST CHANCES FOR SEVERE WEATHER APPEARS OVER AREAS SOUTH
AND WEST OF THE MEMPHIS AREA...INCLUDING PORTIONS OF EAST ARKANSAS
AND NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI. LATER SHIFTS WILL PROVIDE
ADDITIONAL UPDATES ON SEVERE WEATHER THREAT.

.DISCUSSION...
BIGGEST ISSUE ON THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE 
WEATHER MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH.

WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO BE POSITIONED SOUTH OF THE CWA. SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP OUT AHEAD AND ALONG THE FRONT. EXPECT 
SOME OF THESE TO MOVE INTO SOUTHWESTERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT SO WILL KEEP POPS ACROSS THIS AREA. HOWEVER DO 
EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT OUT AHEAD 
OF THE WARM FRONT.

WARM FRONT WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA ON MONDAY. THIS WILL SPREAD 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE ENTIRE CWA. MODELS ARE DIFFERING 
ON HOW WIDESPREAD AND IF IT WILL LAST ALL DAY MONDAY. GUIDANCE HAS 
POPS ALL OVER THE PLACE. WILL TRY TO GO WITH A COMPROMISE. A BAND OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP OUT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING 
COLD FRONT OVER ARKANSAS/TEXAS/LOUISIANA AND WILL MAKE ITS WAY INTO 
WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
MORNING. QUESTION WILL BE WILL ANY SEVERE WEATHER OCCUR WITH IT. IF 
PRECIP OCCURS ALL DAY MONDAY THE ATMOSPHERE MAY BE TOO STABLE FOR 
ANYTHING SEVERE TO OCCUR. HOWEVER IF THE PRECIP ENDS EARLY AND WARM 
UNSTABLE AIR IS ABLE TO PENETRATE INTO THE MIDSOUTH THEN THE 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT OCCUR COULD BECOME SEVERE. MIDSOUTH WILL BE 
LOCATED IN THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF AN STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET. SO THE 
DYNAMICS ARE IN PLACE...WILL JUST HAVE TO WAIT AND SEE IF THE AREA 
WILL HAVE ENOUGH INSTABILITY. THINK THE BEST AREA TO SEE SEVERE IF 
IT OCCURS WILL BE NORTHWEST MISSISSIPPI LATE MONDAY NIGHT...MOVING 
INTO NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. TORNADOES...LARGE HAIL...AND DAMAGING 
WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT IF SEVERE WEATHER OCCURS MONDAY 
NIGHT/TUESDAY MORNING.

AFTER THE INITIAL ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVES THROUGH 
THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING...EXPECT A BREAK IN PRECIP 
BEFORE REDEVELOPMENT OCCURS ALONG THE COLD FRONT. WITH THE BREAK IN 
PRECIP THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BECOME UNSTABLE ALLOWING FOR ANY STORMS 
THAT DEVELOP TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF BECOMING SEVERE. LARGE HAIL WILL 
BE THE MAIN THREAT WITH THESE STORMS WITH EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE 
MIDSOUTH SEEING THE BEST CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER DURING THIS TIME.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY BRINGING DRY 
CONDITIONS BACK TO THE MIDSOUTH. THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL OCCUR 
ON THURSDAY NIGHT WITH AN APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE SYSTEM 
WILL BRING RAIN CHANCES TO THE AREA THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE 
WEEKEND. DRY WEATHER WILL RETURN BY SUNDAY.

A COLD FRONT IS MOVING VERY SLOWLY SOUTH OF NORTH MS THIS MORNING.
HOWEVER...THE DRY AIR HAS BEEN SLOW TO SPREAD INTO THE SOUTHEAST
CORNER OF WEST TN AND INTO NORTH MS...STRATUS HAS FORMED IN THIS
AREA WITH DENSE FOG ACROSS NORTHEAST MS. ISSUED A DENSE FOG
ADVISORY FOR PART OF NORTHEAST MS UNTIL 14Z.

FOR TODAY...THINK HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD INTO THE
MIDSOUTH WITH LOWER SURFACE DEWPOINTS. THINK THE STRATUS WILL THIN
OUT EARLY THIS MORNING. AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE TO THE
SOUTH OF THE MIDSOUTH TODAY CAUSING THUNDERSTORMS. CIRRUS FROM THIS
SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE MIDSOUTH. MEANWHILE...MID
AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL SPREAD INTO THE AREA FROM THE SOUTHWEST
THIS AFTERNOON AS OVERRUNNING SETS UP OVER THE FRONTAL SYSTEM
STALLING TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST. BUT OVERALL THE FIRST DAY OF SPRING
WILL BE PLEASANT WEATHERWISE FOR THE MIDSOUTH.

FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL LIFT BACK TO THE NORTH TONIGHT AND MOVE THROUGH
THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY. MODELS DIFFER ON TIMING AND AMOUNT OF
PRECIPITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT. ATTM...WILL NOT MAKE MUCH
CHANGE TO CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AND MONDAY. THINK THERE WILL
BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS SPREADING INTO THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE SOUTHWEST
TONIGHT. ON MONDAY...SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS CAN BE EXPECTED
ALONG WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS.

A SIGNIFICANT STORM SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT
INTO TUESDAY. A STRONG AND NEGATIVELY TILTED TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE
MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT WITH SURFACE LOW PRESSURE MOVING THROUGH
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. SPC HAS PLACED THE AREAS FROM MEMPHIS SOUTH
AND WEST IN A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE...WITH A SLIGHT RISK ELSEWHERE
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. MODELS INDICATE A SQUALL LINE WILL MOVE THROUGH
THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY. TORNADIC SUPERCELLS ARE
POSSIBLE AHEAD OF THIS LINE. DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL AND
ISOLATED TORNADOES CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THE SQUALL LINE. THE NAM
INDICATED CAPES OF 1000 TO 1500 J/KG ALONG WITH 0-3 KM HELICITY
BETWEEN 400 AND 500 M2/S2 DEVELOPING ACROSS NORTH MS MONDAY NIGHT.
A SOUTHERLY 850 MB JET WILL INCREASE TO 50 KNOTS WITH STRONG
DIFFLUENCE ALOFT.

THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT WILL NOT MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH UNTIL
TUESDAY AFTERNOON AS THE UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES INTO THE AREA.
ADDITIONAL SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE COLD FRONT AND
IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE COLD POOL ALOFT WITH THE UPPER LOW IF THE
ENVIRONMENT CAN RECOVER BEHIND THE SQUALL LINE.

CLOUDS HAVE HUNG UP OVER EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH. EXPECT AS 
THE SUN GOES DOWN...CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR THE REST OF THE CWA 
AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS FURTHER EASTWARD. EXPECT SKIES TO BECOME 
MOSTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
KEEP DRY CONDITIONS AROUND THE CWA ON SUNDAY. ALTHOUGH EXPECT HIGH 
CLOUDS TO BEGIN MOVING INTO THE CWA FROM THE SOUTHWEST AS THE NEXT 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BEGINS TO APPROACH.

CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE SUNDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF A WARM FRONT 
THAT WILL BEGIN PUSHING INTO SOUTHWESTERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA 
OVERNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT. AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE FRONT INTO THE CWA. WILL KEEP SMALL POPS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHWESTERN PORTION OF THE MIDSOUTH. THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE 
PUSHING NORTHWARD ON MONDAY ALLOWING FOR WARM...MOIST...UNSTABLE AIR 
TO FILTER INTO THE AREA. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO SPREAD 
OVER THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH ON MONDAY. BY MONDAY NIGHT...MODELS ARE 
DIFFERING ON TIMING OF THE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE IN THE MIDSOUTH. THE 
GFS IS MUCH FASTER THAN THE NAM WITH THE COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH 
THE MIDSOUTH. THE GFS BRINGS THE COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA ON 
MONDAY NIGHT. THE NAM DOESN/T BRING THE FRONT INTO THE AREA UNTIL 
LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. NO MATTER WHICH ONE IS RIGHT...A LINE 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT. THE 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE SEVERE AS BOTH 
MODELS ARE SHOWING GOOD INSTABILITY(CAPE VALUES OF 1500 J/KG) ACROSS 
THE AREA. IN ADDITION...THE AREA WILL BE IN THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF 
A 110 KT UPPER LEVEL JET AND UNDERNEATH A STRONG LOW LEVEL JET. 
HELICITY VALUES WILL BE AROUND 300 M2/S2. WITH ALL THESE 
INGREDIENTS...LARGE HAIL...DAMAGING WINDS...AND EVEN A FEW TORNADOES 
WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE AREA. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT ALLOWING FOR DRY CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL ACROSS THE CWA. 

THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE CWA ON

00Z GFS AND NAM IN BETTER AGREEMENT THAN EARLIER RUNS WITH COLD
FRONTAL PASSAGE TODAY...AND STORM SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE MIDSOUTH
MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. HOWEVER...THE 06Z NAM HAS COME IN SLOWER WITH
THE SYSTEM MONDAY / TUESDAY...ONCE AGAIN LEADING TO UNCERTAINTY WITH
THE TIMING.

A COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM SOUTHEASTERN MO THROUGH CENTRAL AR INTO
NORTHEAST TX EARLY THIS MORNING. SHOWERS AND FEW THUNDERSTORMS
ARE MOVING INTO THE MIDSOUTH AHEAD OF THE FRONT. BY SUNRISE...
THINK MOST OF THE CONVECTION WILL BE ALONG AND EAST OF THE MS RIVER
AS THE COLD FRONT CONTINUES EASTWARD. BY NOON...ONLY NORTHEAST MS AND
THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF WEST TN WILL STILL HAVE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS
/ STORMS. WILL TAPER POPS TODAY FROM 20 PERCENT JONESBORO AREA TO 60
PERCENT TUPELO AREA. SURFACE BASED LIFTED INDICES AS SHOWN BY LAPS
DATA ARE HIGH ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH SO THINK THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN
ELEVATED AND PROBABLY WEAKEN AS THE NIGHT CONTINUES. SKIES WILL
GRADUALLY CLEAR FROM THE WEST TODAY.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL SPREAD INTO THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. THERE MAY BE
SOME CIRRUS IN THE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT...BUT THINK MOSTLY CLEAR WILL
SUFFICE FOR NOW. DRY WEATHER WILL PERSIST INTO SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES
WILL BE COOL TONIGHT...BUT A LITTLE WARMER SUNDAY.

MODELS INDICATE THE FRONT THAT MOVES THROUGH OUR AREA TODAY WILL
BEGIN TO LIFT BACK NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS
WILL CAUSE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY NIGHT WITH
THE HIGHEST POPS WEST AND SOUTH. A STRONG AND NEGATIVELY TILTED
TROUGH WILL THEN APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY AS SURFACE LOW PRESSURE
MOVES FROM KS TO MO. LIFTED INDICES AS SHOWN BY THE GFS DECREASE TO
MINUS 4 FROM MEMPHIS SOUTHWARD BY LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON. 0-3 KM SHEAR
VALUES INCREASE TO OVER 300 M2/S2 MONDAY NIGHT WITH GOOD DIRECTIONAL
SHEAR. SPC HAS PLACED THE MIDSOUTH IN A RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER FOR
MONDAY / MONDAY NIGHT WHICH CERTAINLY LOOKS REASONABLE WITH THE
POTENTIAL FOR TORNADOES.

BUT NOT MUCH.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE CWA FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. 
THIS WILL ALLOW FOR PLEASANT WEATHER FOR THE END OF THE WEEKEND.

MODELS ARE DIFFERING ON THE APPROACH OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM. THE NAM IS MUCH SLOWER THAN THE GFS WITH BRINGING A WARM 
FRONT THROUGH LATE MONDAY WHERE AS THE GFS STARTS BRINGING THE WARM 
FRONT NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT. CURRENT FORECAST HAS RAIN CHANCES IN FOR

A STRONG UPPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH ANALYZED IN THE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES THIS MORNING WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE
EAST OVER THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT. HAVE INCLUDED ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR
MAINLY LIGHT RAIN OVER MAINLY SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...WHERE
BEST MOISTURE WILL REMAIN. ONCE THIS SHORTWAVE TROUGH CLEARS EAST
OF THE AREA...EXPECT DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AS WEAK
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. WINDS WILL ALSO VEER BACK AROUND TO A MORE
SOUTHERLY DIRECTION LATER ON THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...ALONG WITH AN
INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION. THIS WILL RESULT IN A WARMING
TREND FOR THE END OF THE WEEK...WITH TEMPERATURES REBOUNDING TO
NEAR OR ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGES FOR FRIDAY.

A NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE WILL APPROACH THE AREA LATER ON FRIDAY...
HELPING TO SEND A COLD FRONT EAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH FRIDAY
NIGHT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN MAY BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED WITH THIS
SYSTEM...BUT GOOD FRONTAL FORCING COMBINED WITH STEEPER MID LEVEL
LAPSE RATES AND UPPER LEVEL DIFLUENCE...SHOULD LEAD TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT
SHOULD SWEEP ACROSS THE AREA BY SATURDAY MORNING BEFORE STALLING TO
OUR SOUTH. EXPECT A DRY AND SEASONABLY MILD SATURDAY AS WEAK HIGH
PRESSURE BRIEFLY BUILDS OVER THE REGION. MOISTURE SHOULD QUICKLY
RETURN ON SUNDAY...AS DEEPER MOISTURE OVERRUNS THE STALLED FRONT AS
THE UPPER FLOW TURNS MORE SOUTHWESTERLY. A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW INTO THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK
WITH CHANCES FOR RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS INCREASING FOR SUNDAY
THROUGH MONDAY.

A MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA BY NEXT
TUESDAY WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE. TEMPERATURES WILL
CONTINUE TO WARM INTO THE 60S FOR THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...

RAIN IN NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE MIDSOUTH IS CHANGING TO SLEET
AND THEN SNOW. BELIEVE THIS ACTIVITY WILL LAST THIS EVENING IN
WESTERN COUNTIES AND TO AFTER SUNRISE NEARER THE TN RIVER AND
EXTREME NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. SLEET/SNOW SEEM TO MELTING AS IT
FALLS. ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE MAINLY ON GRASS AND BE LESS THAN AN
INCH. COUNTIES FARTHER NORTH SHOULD GET HEAVIEST AMTS. SNOW/SLEET
WILL END BY MID MORNING AND MELTING WILL QUICKLY OCCUR.

MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST PRECIP NORTH OF TN MS BORDER MAY MIX OR
CHANGE COMPLETELY OVER TO SNOW...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN

AIR TEMPS IN LOWER 50S. WITH DEWPOINTS IN LOWER 20S...CANNOT RULE
OUT THESE REPORTS. WILL CARRY MENTION OF CHANCE OF SLEET IN ALL
AREAS TONIGHT. REMAINDER OF DISCUSSION STILL APPLIES.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 137 PM....
LITTLE CHANGE IN SURFACE FEATURES SINCE MORNING DISCUSSION. STILL
SEEING PLENTY OF ECHOES ON RADAR...BUT LITTLE PRECIPITATION ACTUALLY
BEING REPORTED. TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM MID 40S NORTH TO MID 50S
SOUTH...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE TEENS AND 20S UNDER BRISK NORTHEAST
WIND.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
BIGGEST FORECAST ISSUE IS IN THE FIRST 18 HOURS...AND MAINLY
ABOUT PRECIPITATION TYPE. ISENTROPIC LIFT TRIGGERING PRECIPITATION
ECHOES ACROSS THE AREA...BUT NOT SEEING MANY GROUND TRUTH REPORTS OF
PRECIPITATION REACHING THE GROUND.

MODELS SATURATE THE AIRMASS ENOUGH TO WHERE THERE SHOULD BE SOME
MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE AREA...BUT NOT A LOT. ETA
SOUNDINGS INDICATE PRECIPITATION COULD BE MIXED OR FROZEN ACROSS
ABOUT NORTHERN 2 TIERS OF COUNTIES. GFS ISNT QUITE AS BULLISH ON
COLD AIR...BUT WILL MENTION A MIX FAR NORTH AFTER MIDNIGHT. LIKELY TO
CATEGORICAL POPS DURING THE EVENING...THEN LOWERING SOME AFTER
MIDNIGHT. WILL LEAVE CHANCE POPS IN FOR WEDNESDAY...AS STORM TRACK
NEVER GETS VERY FAR SOUTH OF OUR AREA...AND IMPULSES CONTINUE TO MOVE
TOWARD US FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

LOOKS LIKE MAIN PIECE OF SOUTHWEST SYSTEM COMES AT US WEDNESDAY
NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. PRECIPITATION PROBABLY A LITTLE MORE LIKELY
SOUTH OF US THAN ACROSS OUR AREA. TEMPERATURES A LITTLE WARMER...SO
ALL LIQUID THAT TIME AROUND. A BREAK IN THE WEATHER FOR THURSDAY
NIGHT AND FRIDAY.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THURSDAY...WITH SOME
MODERATION FRIDAY. DIDNT SEE A NEED TO MAKE MAJOR CHANGES TO
FORECAST TEMPS BEYOND FIRST PERIOD.
&&

.LONG TERM (BEYOND FRIDAY)...
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS COMING INTO A LITTLE MORE AGREEMENT WITH THE
PATTERN...AS FLOW FINALLY BECOMES ZONAL TO SOUTHWEST OVER THE
WEEKEND. THIS WILL ALLOW MILDER WEATHER TO MOVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH...
BUT WITH CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION...PROBABLY SUNDAY AND MONDAY.
MODELS DO DISAGREE ON EXACT LOCATION AND STRENGTH OF THE MAIN
SYSTEM...SO WONT HIT POPS TOO HARD FOR NOW. HPC POPS DONT MATCH UP
WELL WITH THEIR SURFACE PROGS AROUND DAYS 5 AND 6...WENT OUR OWN WAY.
GFS RUN AT 12Z INDICATES OUR MINS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT ARE WAY TOO LOW.
BUMPED THEM UP A FEW DEGREES...BUT NOT AS HIGH AS GUIDANCE WOULD
INDICATE...BECAUSE WE ARE ALREADY WARMER THAN THE NEIGHBORS BY
SEVERAL DEGREES.

FAIRLY ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IN STORE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS A
SERIES OF SHORTWAVES MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. CURRENTLY...SOME VERY
LIGHT RAIN IS FALLING OVER SOUTHERN HALF OF FORECAST AREA. MOST OF
THE RAIN IS NOT REACHING THE GROUND AND WHAT IS COMING DOWN AS
SPRINKLES. WILL LEAVE MENTION OF SPRINKLES IN THE FORECAST FOR THIS
MORNING OVER THOSE AREAS. RAIN CHANCE BEGIN TO INCREASE THIS
AFTERNOON AS FIRST SHORTWAVE APPROACHES THE REGION FROM NORTHEAST
TEXAS. BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WITH THIS SYSTEM IS TONIGHT WHERE HAVE
KEPT CATEGORICAL POPS IN. MODELS STILL NOT IN AGREEMENT REGARDING A
POSSIBLE RAIN/SNOW MIX. GFS IS THE WARMER MODEL WHILE THE NAM LEANS
MORE TOWARD A POSSIBLE MIX FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA. PREVIOUS FORECASTS HAVE LEANED TOWARD THE GFS AND SEE NO
REASON TO SWITCH AT THIS TIME SO NO MENTION OF SNOW AT THIS TIME.
THINGS BEGIN TO QUIET DOWN SOMEWHAT ON WEDNESDAY WITH CHANCE POPS
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS SURFACE LOW WHICH IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP
IN THE NORTHERN GULF PULLS NORTHEAST TOWARD THE CAROLINA COAST. NEXT
SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH THE REGION THURSDAY SO THERE STILL BE A
CHANCE OF RAIN. THINGS FINALLY DRY OUT FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY
BUT THEN UPPER LEVEL LOW PULLS INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS ON FRIDAY
AND BRINGS ANOTHER SHOT OF RAIN FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER
RETURNS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BEFORE ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVES
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO WARM UP

AFTERNOON WITH TEMPERATURES MAINLY IN THE 50S. DEWPOINTS ARE
RATHER LOW...UPPER TEENS TO MID 20S.

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH THURSDAY)...
QUIET EVENING TONIGHT UNDER SURFACE RIDGE. IMPULSE KICKING OUT OF
SOUTHWEST LOW WILL START TO INCREASE HIGH CLOUDS TONIGHT. COMBINED
WITH WINDS AROUND 10 KNOTS...DONT EXPECT LOWS TO BE QUITE AS COOL AS
THIS MORNING. IF WINDS DIE OFF...HOWEVER...FORECAST WILL BE AT LEAST
3 TO 5 DEGREES TOO WARM.

ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL ALLOW CEILINGS TO LOWER DURING THE DAY ON
TUESDAY...WITH RAIN DEVELOPING IN WESTERN SECTIONS BY LATE MORNING
OR EARLY AFTERNOON. IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR PRECIP TO REACH THE
SURFACE WITH EXTREMELY LOW DEWPOINTS TO OVERCOME. ONCE PRECIPITATION
STARTS...TEMPERATURES WILL BE STEADY OR FALL. POPS FOR THE 12 HOUR
PERIOD TOMORROW WILL RANGE FROM CHANCE NORTHEAST TO LIKELY
SOUTHWEST.

INVERTED TROF MOVES ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY

TYPE MAY BECOME AN ISSUE. GFS IS QUITE A BIT WARMER THAN NAM...AND
HANDLED TEMPERATURE REGIME LAST SYSTEM BETTER. FORECAST WILL TREND
TOWARD GFS...KEEPING ALL PRECIPITATION TUESDAY NIGHT LIQUID...BUT
LATER FORECASTS WILL NEED TO MONITOR THIS.

PRECIPITATION SHOULD END DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY...WITH THURSDAY
BEING DRY.

TEMPERATURES...TONIGHT AND TUESDAY ALREADY DISCUSSED ABOVE. LOWERED
MINS TUESDAY NIGHT AND MAXES WEDNESDAY FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST DUE
TO PRECIPITATION. KEEPING ALL SITES ABOVE FREEZING HOWEVER. NO

LIFT AND DEEP MOISTURE DEPICTED SWINGING THROUGH THE REGION SO WL
INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY TUE NIGHT.

SHORTWAVE MOVES TO THE EAST OF THE REGION ON WED. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE
EXTENDS FROM THE GREAT LAKES ACRS MO WITH SFC FRONT ALONG THE GULF
COAST. THE AREA WL BE IN BETWEEN UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS WITH DEEPER
MOISTURE SHUNTED TO THE EAST SO WL KEEP JUST CHC POPS. TEMPS WL
STILL BE COOL WITH PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER THOUGH.

AS WE MOVE INTO THE MID RANGE/EXTENDED FORECAST THE GFS HAS COME
AROUND TO THE MORE CONSISTENT ECMWF SOLUTION SO THERE IS SOME
GROWING CONFIDENCE IN FORECAST WHICH IS LIKELY TO BE WETTER THAN
PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. EXPECT ANOTHER UPPER TROF TO SWING THROUGH THE

NEWEST RUNS OF THE ETA AND GFS NOW SHOW THE FRONT HANGING UP OVER 
NORTH MS BY MORNING. THE CHANCES FOR RAIN OVER PORTIONS OF THE AREA 
HAVE GONE UP FOR TOMORROW BECAUSE THE FRONT IS MUCH FURTHER NORTH 
THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. BOTH MODELS SHOWING MOISTURE POOLING ALONG 
THE FRONT RESULTING IN INCREASING CLOUDS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. THE 
850MB FRONT IS LAGGING WELL BEHIND THE SURFACE FRONT...JUST GETTING

ALONG THE SURFACE FRONT AND AFFECT AREAS MAINLY ACROSS NORTHEAST 
MS...THE 850MB LOW AND FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND TOMORROW NIGHT. THIS WILL RESULT IN CHANCES OF RAIN 
MAINLY SOUTH OF I 40. THERE IS NOT A WHOLE LOT OF MOISTURE WITH THIS 
SYSTEM...HOWEVER THE SLOW PROGRESSION OF THE SYSTEM AND ENTRANCE 
REGION TO UPPER JET RESULTING IN EXCELLENT LIFT WILL PROVIDE GOOD 
CHANCES FOR RAIN. THERE IS SOME INSTABILITY SOUTH OF THE

NOTICEABLY COLDER TOMORROW WITH THE FRONT SOUTH OF THE REGION AND 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION POURING IN BEHIND IT. CLOUD COVER FURTHER 
COMPLICATING THINGS...TEMPS LIKELY TO RISE ONLY A FEW DEGREES. 

CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL LINGER INTO MONDAY MORNING OVER NORTHEAST

SURFACE COLD FRONT HAS MOVED INTO THE GEORGIA AND THE FLORIDA

DIMINISH THIS EVENING AS THE BETTER MIXING IS LOST WITH THE DAYTIME

WINDS WILL BECOME STRONG ONCE AGAIN IN THE MORNING AS DAYTIME 
HEATING ALLOWS US TO TAP INTO THOSE STRONGER WINDS OFF THE SURFACE. 
THE WIND ADVISORY WILL BE REISSUED FOR THE DAYTIME HOURS TOMORROW. 
THE STRONG WINDS OVER THE REGION ARE DUE TO A TROUGH OF COLD AIR

STRONG SHORTWAVE ROTATING AROUND THE TROUGH ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF

THE SHORTWAVE WILL SINK SOUTHWARD OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. THE

A COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM EAST CENTRAL MISSOURI THROUGH NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS. RADARS FROM PADUCAH AND SPRINGFIELD HAVE SHOWN SOME ECHOS 
WITH THE FRONT. HOWEVER...THIS APPEARS TO BE MAINLY VIRGA WITH THE 
ECHOS DISSIPATING AS THEY APPROACH THE PADUCAH RADAR. SINCE THE LOW 
LEVELS ARE RATHER DRY...WILLL KEEP A DRY FORECAST GOING ALTHOUGH A 
SPRINKLE IS POSSIBLE BUT PROBABLY NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO MENTION. 
SATELLITE ALSO SHOWS THAT THE CLOUDS ARE FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE SO 
EXPECT THAT IF SKIES BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY THAT IT WILL ONLY LAST FOR 
AN HOUR OR TWO. WINDS SHOULD STAY UP TONIGHT...SO NO FOG PROBLEMS 
EXPECTED TONIGHT. 

LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER WINDY DAY AGAIN TOMORROW. ETA HINTING THAT THE 
WINDS MAY BE JUST STRONG ENOUGH TO REACH WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA OF 
SUSTAINED 25 MPH OVER PORTIONS OF THE AREA TOMORROW. RIGHT NOW ITS 
BORDERLINE SO WILL LET OVERNIGHT SHIFT TAKE A LOOK AT IT. ANOTHER 
CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL ARRIVE LATE TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND TOMORROW 
NIGHT. THE SITUATION APPEARS VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY WITH THE ETA 
ATTEMPTING TO SHOW RAIN OUT OF A MID CLOUD DECK WHILE THE GFS 
REMAINS DRY. BASED UPON TRENDS...WILL NOT INCLUDE POPS BUT WILL 
MENTION SPRINKLES. THERE IS A FINE LINE BETWEEN THE REALLY COLD AIR 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE EASTERN US TROUGH AND WARMER AIR WITH THE 
WESTERN RIDGE...AND THE MIDSOUTH WILL BE VERY CLOSE TO THAT LINE. 
THE ETA AND NGM IS FURTHER WEST WITH THE COLD AIR WHILE THE GFS 
REMAINS FURTHER EAST. AS A RESULT THERE IS A BIG DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
THE TEMPERATURE OUTPUT BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS. WITHOUT A STRONG 
REASON TO DISCREDIT EITHER SOLUTION AT THIS POINT...HAVE SPLIT THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE TWO AND HOPE THAT LATER RUNS COME INTO BETTER 
AGREEMENT. HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES INTO THE REGION ON SATURDAY 
RESULTING IN DRY CONDITIONS.

UPPER LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BEGIN TO BECOME MORE ZONAL TOWARDS 
EARLY NEXT WEEK AS THE WESTERN RIDGE BREAKS DOWN. ANOTHER CLIPPER 
SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. BOTH MODELS ARE INDICATING 
THAT A FAIRLY STRONG DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE OVERHEAD AT THIS TIME 
POSSIBLY RESULTING IN SOME RAIN. THINK THAT ANY RAIN WILL REMAIN 
ALONG THE FRONT AND EXPECT THAT BY THE TIME THAT THIS DISTURBANCE 
ARRIVES THAT THE FRONT WILL ALREADY BE SOUTH OF THE REGION. BY 
MIDWEEK THE GFS SHOWS AN UPPER TROUGH PROGRESSING OUT OF THE WESTERN 
PLAINS AND INTO THE MS VALLEY REGION WHICH LOOKS LIKE THE BEST 
CHANCES FOR RAIN.

THAT EXTENDS NORTHEASTWARD ALONG THE MS RIVER TO NEAR COVINGTON AND

ACROSS NORTH MS AND WILL MOVE INTO ALABAMA OVERNIGHT. 

HAVE INCREASED POPS MAINLY ACROSS NORTHEAST MS FOR THIS EVENING WITH 
THE RAIN EXITING THE AREA A LITTLE SLOWER THAN EXPECTED. AREA 
REMAINS IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...WHICH MEANS QUICK HITTING SYSTEMS. 
SO...SKIES WILL CLEAR TONIGHT FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST. THE NEXT 
SHORTWAVE WILL ARRIVE TOMORROW. HOWEVER...IT LOOKS LIKE THE UPPER 
LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH DURING THE DAY WHILE THE SURFACE 
FRONT WILL NOT MOVE THROUGH UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT. AS A RESULT...THE 
LIFT WITH THIS SYSTEM IS VERY WEAK AND HAVE DECIDED TO REMOVE THE 
MENTION OF RAIN WITH THIS SYSTEM. ANOTHER WEAK CLIPPER SYSTEM MOVES 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...ONCE AGAIN WEAK DYNAMICS AND LITTLE CHANCES 
FOR RAIN. 
GOOD WARM AIR ADVECTION TAKES PLACE ON SATURDAY AHEAD OF A STRONGER 
FRONT. HAVE LEFT IN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN WITH THE FRONT AS IT 
MOVES THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. ALTHOUGH THE LIFT IS NOT ALL THAT 
IMPRESSIVE...THE TEMP CONTRAST ALONG THE FRONT MAY BE STRONG ENOUGH 
FOR SOME RAIN. 

HIGH PRESSURE AND AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT RIDGE SHOULD PROVIDE DRY 
WEATHER FOR MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. THE UPPER FLOW BEGINS TO TRANSITION 
BY MIDWEEK AS A CUT OFF LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN US AND

PRECIPITATION FALLING OVER MUCH OF SOUTHERN MISSOURI AND WESTERN
ARKANSAS THIS MORNING WITH RAIN/SNOW LINE WELL INTO CENTRAL MISSOURI
AT THIS TIME. WITH DEWPOINTS REMAINING AT OR BELOW FREEZING OVER
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA...STILL CANT RULE OUT A MIX
OF RAIN AND SNOW THIS MORNING. HAVE KEPT MENTION OF RAIN/SNOW MIX
BUT HAVE MOVED RAIN/SNOW LINE FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST.
ALSO HAVE UPPED POPS A LITTLE TO CATEGORICAL OVER ENTIRE FORECAST
AREA. MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD HAVE ENDED BY 00Z EXCEPT FOR
EXTREME SOUTHEAST CORNER OF FORECAST AREA WHERE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
FOR EARLY EVENING. ANOTHER SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH THE REGION
THURSDAY SO KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN STARTING THURSDAY AFTERNOON
AND CONTINUING THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY NIGHT. RAIN SHOULD END BEFORE
06Z FRIDAY SO NO REASON TO THINK THERE WILL BE ANY MIXED
PRECIPITATION. NOT VERY CONFIDENT IN EXTENDED FORECAST AS MODELS
INDICATE MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW PATTERN. PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS HAD TRIED
TO KEEP WEAK BOUNDARY OVER REGION BUT NEW GFS DOESNT HAVE THAT MUCH
OF A BOUNDARY. WILL LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR SATURDAY NIGHT
THROUGH TUESDAY BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED IF LATER MODEL RUNS SHOW
A REASON TO REMOVE THEM.

.DISCUSSION...

CURRENT FORECAST HAS BEEN A LITTLE TOO PROGRESSIVE WITH THE GIVEN 
SCENARIO. APPEARS THAT THE BULK OF RAIN/SNOW ACTIVITY WILL OCCUR A 
LITTLE LATER THAN PREVIOUS THOUGHTS. LATEST DATA SUPPORTS THE SYSTEM 
MOVING INTO THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 3 AM. THIS 
IS WHEN THE LIGHT RAIN OR SNOW WILL OCCUR. 

FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE A VERY COLD COLUMN WITH ABOUT 2KFT OF 
AIR ABOVE FREEZING. THIS WOULD MEAN THAT SNOW FLAKES WILL FALL...BUT 
HAVE PLENTY OF TIME TO MELT BEFORE REACHING THE SURFACE. THERE WILL 
BE A BRIEF TIME WHERE THERE WILL BE DEFINITE SHOTS FOR ALL SNOW 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND BOOTHEEL OF 
MISSOURI. STILL FEEL THAT SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE MINIMAL GIVEN THE 
SPEED AND DURATION OF THIS CLIPPER SYSTEM. 

HAVE BACKED OFF CHANCES FOR RAIN/SNOW OVERNIGHT SINCE THE SYSTEM HAS 
SLOWED. ALSO TWEAKED TEMPERATURES MAINLY EASTERN AREAS IN TN ALONG 
THE TN RIVER. NO OTHER CHANGES AT THIS TIME.

HIGH PRESSURE NOW OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL KEEP WEATHER QUIET
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT. NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM
WILL DIVE OUT OF THE NORTHERN ROCKIES AND BEGIN TO MOVE IN TOWARD
THE REGION BY LATE TONIGHT. QUESTION REMAINS AS TO PRECIP TYPE
ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT EITHER LIGHT RAIN OR LIGHT SNOW IS POSSIBLE
FROM 06Z UNTIL 18Z SO HAVE MENTIONED BOTH DURING THOSE TIME PERIODS.
FURTHER SOUTH...PRECIPITATION WILL BE ALL RAIN. HAVE UPPED POPS ON
WEDNESDAY TO LIKELY FOR ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. AFTER 18Z WEDNESDAY...
ONLY RAIN IS EXPECTED. MOST AREAS SHOULD SEE RAIN END BEFORE 00Z
EXCEPT EXTREME SOUTHEAST CORNER WHERE ADDED CHANCE POPS FOR EARLY
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER RETURNS FOR THURSDAY BUT ANOTHER WEAK
DISTURBANCE MOVES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT SO KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
IN FOR THEN. FLOW THEN BECOME LESS AMPLIFIED AND MORE ZONAL BY THE

INITIAL SHOWERS SLOWLY COMING TO AN END WITH ADDITIONAL RAIN 
POPPING UP OVER PARTS OF WESTERN TN THIS EVENING. COLD FRONT HAS 
MOVED THROUGH THE MAJORITY OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. 
NORTHWEST WINDS GUSTING TO 25 MPH AND TEMPERATURES FALLING INTO THE 
30S OVERNIGHT WILL OCCUR.

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE DRIFTING ACROSS ARKANSAS AS SEEN ON WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY WILL MOVE TOWARDS THE AREA THROUGH MIDNIGHT. THIS FEATURE IS 
PICKED UP WELL BY THE RUC MODEL. SOME LIGHTNING STRIKES OCCURRING 
WITH THIS WAVE AS THE COLD CORE CAUSES THE INSTABILITY. THUS WILL 
MENTION A FEW MORE SHOWERS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. 

MODEL DATA A LITTLE SLOW COMING IN THIS EVENING. THERE WAS SOME 
DISAGREEMENT WITH THE MODELS FROM EARLIER WITH THE GFS BEING THE 
COLDEST. THIS WILL PLAY A FACTOR IN THE CHANCES FOR SNOWFALL ACROSS 
THE REGION FOR WEDNESDAY. A STRONG SHORTWAVE DIVING OUT OF CANADA 
WILL DRIFT ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND INTO THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY. IF ENOUGH MOISTURE CAN BE REALIZED...THEN THE CHANCES FOR 
SNOW WILL INCREASE EARLY WEDNESDAY. THE GOOD THING IS THAT THE 
SYSTEM WILL BE FAST MOVING WHICH WOULD LIMIT SNOWFALL TOTALS. 
AGAIN..THIS IS LOOKING AT 18Z MODEL DATA FOR WEDNESDAY. THE MAIN 
AREA OF CONCERN FOR THIS TO  OCCUR WILL BE NORTH OF A DECATURVILLE 
TN TO SOMERVILLE TO MEMPHIS TO WYNN AR LINE. AS MENTIONED...THE GFS 
MODEL IS COLDER BUT SEEMS TO HANDLE THIS TYPE OF SCENARIO A TAD 
BETTER THAN OTHER MODELS. THERE IS ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY IN THE 
FORECAST TO JUSTIFY THE CURRENT MENTION OF RAIN OR SNOW FOR THIS 
TIME PERIOD FOR THE AREA OUTLINED ABOVE.

UPDATED INFORMATION ON THIS FORECAST WILL CONTINUE EARLY TOMORROW 
MORNING.

SHOWERS HAVE RAPIDLY BROKEN OUT OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI SINCE 1030Z.
HAVE UPDATED FORECAST TO CALL FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS EARLY THIS
MORNING BEFORE MAIN PRECIPITATION GETS GOING LATER TODAY. MAY ALSO
NEED TO CONSIDER LOWERING MAX TEMPS AS IT IS BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE
CLOUDS MAY BE DIFFICULT TO GET RID OF TODAY. THIS MAY AID IN
LOWERING SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL LATER IN THE DAY.

COLD FRONT NEAR A LSE-MCI-AMA LINE AT 08Z. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SURGING

OVER WEST TEXAS...AND SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS DEVELOPING OVER SOUTHERN

FIRST CONCERN WILL BE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER TODAY. LOOKS LIKE
CAPES WONT BE MUCH ABOVE 500-700 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES IN -1 TO -3

GET ENOUGH WARMING TO REALIZE THE FORECAST INSTABILITY. EXPECT THAT
BEST INSTABILITY AND CAPE WILL OCCUR TO OUR SOUTH. AS MOISTURE
INCREASES AND FRONT/TROF NEARS US...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON
HOURS...EXPECT CONVECTION TO DEVELOP.

MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND WIND FIELDS WOULD SUPPORT SEVERE WEATHER...
MAINLY DAMAGING WINDS...IF WE GET ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP.
PROBLEM IS...IF GULF COAST CONVECTION DEVELOPS AS EXPECTED...THIS MAY
DISRUPT THE DEVELOPMENT OF ORGANIZED CONVECTION IN OUR AREA BY
STEALING SOME OF THE AVAILABLE MOISTURE. WILL KEEP MENTION IN HWO...

DRY AFTER MIDNIGHT. SKIES WILL CLEAR RAPIDLY BEHIND THE FRONT...AND
REMAIN CLEAR THROUGH AT LEAST THE EVENING HOURS TUESDAY NIGHT.

NEXT IMPULSE TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT TUESDAY NIGHT
INTO WEDNESDAY. MODELS AGAIN HAVING TROUBLE AGREEING ON SCENARIO.
GFS STRONGER WITH A FURTHER SOUTH SURFACE LOW...NAM WEAKER AND
FURTHER NORTH. GFS LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS...NAM ALMOST NONE.
ALSO SEEING ABOUT A 15 DEGREE DIFFERENCE IN FORECAST MAX TEMPS FOR
WEDNESDAY. CURRENT FORECAST IS ABOUT MIDWAY IN BETWEEN THE TWO...SO
WILL KEEP THAT AND HOPE THAT MODELS GET A LITTLE CLOSER ON A
SOLUTION SOON.
&&

.LONG TERM (BEYOND WEDNESDAY)...
THE ONE CONSISTENT TREND IN GFS EXTENDED GUIDANCE OVER THE LAST
WEEK...IS THAT IT HAS SWUNG BACK AND FORTH ON HANDLING OF COLD
AIR. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DO INDICATE MODIFICATION FROM A NORTHWEST
FLOW OVER OUR AREA TO MORE OF A ZONAL ONE BY THE WEEKEND...BUT LITTLE

.DISCUSSION...LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED INTO THE 60S TO 
NEAR 70 THUS FAR. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS BOTH NORTHERN STREAM 
TROUGH AND SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH SLOWLY BEGINNING TO PHASE ACROSS 
THE PLAINS. MAIN CONCERN THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS SEVERE WEATHER 
POTENTIAL ON MONDAY. 

TONIGHT...CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE DURING THE EVENING AS 
MID/HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. RAIN SHOULD 
HOLD OFF ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY 
EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WHERE RATHER WEAK MID LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES /6.0 C/KM OR BELOW/ AND LOW LEVEL DRY AIR WILL BE PRESENT. MID 
LEVEL DYNAMICAL FORCING /700-500 MB Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE/ AND BETTER 
LAPSE RATES WILL REMAIN ACROSS CENTRAL ARKANSAS. LOWS TONIGHT WILL 
BE CONSIDERABLY WARMER TONIGHT WITH THE AREA UNDER CLOUDS AND 
INCREASING WARM AIR ADVECTION. 

MONDAY...COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH LATE MONDAY 
AFTERNOON/MONDAY EVENING. AGAIN...THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE AMOUNT OF 
SURFACE BASED HEATING AVAILABLE DURING THE DAY TO ASSIST OTHER 
PARAMETERS CURRENTLY SUPPORTIVE OF SEVERE WEATHER. 35KT LOW LEVEL 
JET CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS OKLAHOMA WILL GRADUALLY MOVE EAST OVER 
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON MONDAY AND INCREASE TO AROUND 45KTS. 60KT 
WINDS AT 500 MB ALONG...ADEQUATE BUT NOT IDEAL 700 MB DEWPOINT 
DEPRESSIONS GREATER THAN 5C...AND A NEARLY UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND 
PROFILE ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SUGGEST CONVECTION WILL 
DEVELOP INTO A LINE WITH BOWING SEGMENTS. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW THE 
ATMOSPHERE REMAINING NEARLY SATURATED IN THE ENTIRE COLUMN. HOWEVER 
UPSTREAM VISIBLE SATELLITE TRENDS ACROSS SOUTHERN TEXAS OVER THE 
PAST COUPLE OF HOURS SHOWING SOME SMALL BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS. AT 
THIS POINT I THINK AREAS PRIMARILY SOUTH OF I-40...ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI HAVE THE BEST CHANCE OF SEEING A LITTLE BIT OF 
SUNSHINE BEFORE THE PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION ARRIVES. TEMPERATURES 
WILL DROP INTO THE 30S TO LOWER 40S OVERNIGHT AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE. 
AT THIS TIME AGREE WITH SPC THAT BEST RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER SHOULD 
MAINLY BE ALONG AND SOUTH OF I-40 WHERE BETTER INSTABILITY WILL BE 
LOCATED IN THE AFTERNOON. EVENING SHIFT WILL AGAIN EVALUATE SEVERE 
WEATHER POTENTIAL AFTER 00Z MODEL RUN BEGINS TO COME IN TONIGHT. 

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH ON TUESDAY. 850 MB TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO AROUND -3 TO -4C 
SUPPORTING HIGHS IN THE 40S TO LOWER 50S UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY/PARTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL AFFECT THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND WEDNESDAY. ONLY MADE TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS AS WEATHER/POP GRIDS 
HANDLING SITUATION WELL. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...LONG RANGE MODELS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT WITH OVERALL NORTH AMERICAN PATTERN TRANSITIONING FROM 
WESTERN US RIDGING/EASTERN US TROUGHING TO A ZONAL FLOW ACROSS THE 
US BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. NO MAJOR CHANGES TO LONG RANGE GRIDS...ONLY 
FOR TIMING AND MAKING MINOR ADJUSTMENTS FOR TEMPERATURES NEXT 
WEEKEND. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEPART THE AREA ON THURSDAY. 12Z 
GFS WARMER THAN PREVIOUS GFS RUNS ALONG WITH BOUNDARY LAYER 
REMAINING WARM SHOULD KEEP ANY REMAINING PRECIP AS ALL RAIN BEFORE 
TAPERING OFF. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW WILL AFFECT 
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON FRIDAY. HOWEVER THE BEST FORCING 
WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEYS AND WILL 
KEEP MENTION OF SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR NOW. TEMPERATURES WILL 
WARM OVER THE WEEKEND AS THE LATEST MODEL RUN SHOWS SIGNS OF 
TRANSITIONING TO SOUTHWEST FLOW.

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES SURFACE COLD FRONT 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST U.S. WITH HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA REACHED THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 
60S...EVEN THOUGH THE WINDS HAVE BEEN PRIMARILY FROM THE NORTHWEST 
ALL DAY. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS TWO UPPER LEVEL LOWS...ONE ACROSS 
WYOMING AND THE OTHER ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST U.S. MAIN FOCUS THIS 
FORECAST PACKAGE IS MAINLY PRECIPITATION CHANCES ASSOCIATED WITH 
NEXT COLD FRONT WHICH WILL PASS THROUGH THE MID SOUTH ON MONDAY. 

TONIGHT...VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS CIRRUS SHIELD ASSOCIATED WITH LOW 
OVER THE SOUTHWEST GRADUALLY SPREADING EAST. TEMPERATURES WILL 
GRADUALLY BEGIN TO DROP TONIGHT INTO THE 30S WITH MOSTLY CLEAR TO 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES EXPECTED AS SOME OF THE CIRRUS WILL GRADUALLY 
SPREAD EAST.

SUNDAY...WINDS WILL GRADUALLY VEER TO THE SOUTH AS SURFACE HIGH AND  
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE MOVES EAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. WARM AIR 
ADVECTION WILL INCREASE THROUGHOUT THE DAY...ESPECIALLY IN THE 
AFTERNOON. 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL RISE TO 8C BY LATE 
AFTERNOON...WHICH SUPPORTS HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S UNDER 
MOSTLY SUNNY/PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. 

SUNDAY NIGHT...WARM ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE 
NIGHT AS COLD FRONT INCHES CLOSER TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW LOW/MID LEVEL MOISTURE NOT ARRIVING UNTIL AFTER 
12Z...AND WILL LEAVE DRY FOR NOW.

MONDAY AND TUESDAY...COLD FRONT EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE MID SOUTH 
MONDAY AFTERNOON/MONDAY EVENING. SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL COULD BE 
QUITE TRICKY DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY AVAILABLE AS THE 
FRONT APPROACHES. 850MB LOW LEVEL JET WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
DURING THE DAY WITH 500 MB WINDS AROUND 50KTS AND DECENT 700MB 
DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS UPSTREAM. UNDER IDEAL CONDITIONS THIS WOULD 
SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF BOWING SEGMENTS WITH THE LINE...ESPECIALLY IF 
ENOUGH DAYTIME HEATING OCCURS. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW MUCH IF NOT ALL 
OF THE FORECAST AREA REMAINING MOSTLY CLOUDY/CLOUDY THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY AND THINK ORGANIZED SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL AT THIS TIME MAY BE 
TRENDING LOW. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN BEHIND THE FRONT ON 
TUESDAY WITH HIGHS PRIMARILY IN THE 60S. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...LONG RANGE MODELS IN BETTER CONSENSUS 
TODAY WITH OVERALL UPPER AIR PATTERN...ESPECIALLY THE GFS. NOT 
EXPECTING A PATTERN CHANGE AT THIS TIME WITH OVERALL UPPER AIR 
PATTERN SUGGESTING WESTERN U.S. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL RETROGRADE A 
BIT WITH ANOTHER SHORTWAVE RIDING UP AND OVER THE RIDGE INTO THE 
EASTERN U.S. BY THE END OF NEXT WEEKEND. AS A RESULT...EXPECTING 
SHORTWAVES IN NORTHWEST FLOW TO BRING A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION TO 
THE REGION EVERY OTHER DAY OR TWO.

A HANDFUL OF SHOWERS WITH A COUPLE EMBEDDED LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE 
OCCURRED ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND WEST TENNESSEE NORTH OF 
INTERSTATE 40. CURRENT FORECAST DEPICTS THIS SCENARIO FAIRLY WELL 
WHERE MARGINAL AND ELEVATED INSTABILITY EXISTS. 

ACTUAL COLD FRONT..RESIDES ACROSS CENTRAL MISSOURI AT THIS TIME. 
CURRENT 00Z SOUNDING FOR MEMPHIS AIRPORT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF 
WISCONSIN (HTTP://CIMMS/SSEC/WISC.EDU/AERI/REALTIME/MEMPHIS) SHOWS 
MORE STABLE AND DRIER MID LEVELS THAN COMPARED TO THE NORTH WITH LI

INDICATE SHORTWAVE SLIDING SOUTHEAST ALONG ILLINOIS/MISSOURI/IOWA 
TRI-STATE BORDER REGION.  THIS SHORT WAVE DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE SATURDAY MORNING. THIS SHORTWAVE

WESTERN MISSOURI/SE KANSAS/NE OKLAHOMA. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON ARE MOSTLY IN THE 60S. VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS 
AN ALTOCU FIELD ACROSS SOUTHEAST MISSOURI. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS 
THIS PACKAGE WILL BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES TONIGHT AND MONDAY. 

TONIGHT...SHORTWAVE LOCATED ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST WILL SWING 
THROUGH THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT. 700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES WILL STEEPEN TO 7 C/KM IN RESPONSE TO THE TROUGH. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE BEST AREA OF WEAK INSTABILITY WILL BE TOWARDS THE 
MO BOOTHEEL AND ACROSS N TENNESSEE NEAR THE KENTUCKY BORDER WITH 
600-700 J/KG OF CAPE AND LI/S AROUND -2.  

SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN 
ACROSS THE AREA WITH TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES LOWER THAN TODAY AS 
THERMAL TROUGH MOVES THROUGH DURING THE DAY. 

SUNDAY...WARM ADVECTION BEGINS TO SETUP ACROSS THE MID SOUTH IN 
ADVANCE OF NEXT COLD FRONT TO ARRIVE ON MONDAY AND AS UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGE TRANSLATES EAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. ADJUSTED 
TEMPERATURES UP A FEW DEGREES FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST AS 850 MB 
TEMPERATURES WILL RISE TO AROUND 8C BY 00Z MONDAY...WHICH WOULD 
SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S. MAY NEED TO RAISE 
TEMPERATURES A BIT MORE BUT WILL WAIT FOR ANOTHER RUN BEFORE DOING 
SO. 

MONDAY...MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE WITH HANDLING OF COLD FRONT SET TO 
ARRIVE MONDAY AFTERNOON/MONDAY EVENING. NAM /ETA/ IS A BIT SLOWER 
THAN THE GFS AND KEEPS THE BEST DYNAMICAL FORCING ACROSS THE MID 
MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEYS...WHILE THE GFS DIGS DEEPER ACROSS THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 850MB LOW LEVEL JET WILL TRANSPORT SOME LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO. STABILITY PARAMETERS AT THIS 
TIME SUGGEST THAT ANY THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE ELEVATED WITH BEST 
CHANCES FOR THUNDER MOSTLY WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...LATEST 00Z LONG RANGE MODEL RUN 
CONSISTENCY NOT THAT GREAT AS MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE ON DAYS 6 AND 
7. GFS AND NOGAPS STILL BOTH HINTING AT WESTERN US RIDGE BREAKING 
DOWN BY NEXT WEEKEND BUT EUROPEAN SHOWING AMPLIFICATION OF THE 
RIDGE. AS A RESULT...WILL KEEP DAY 7 DRY FOR NOW UNTIL ANALYSIS OF 
LATER MODEL RUNS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT

MID WEEK PRODUCING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH ON 
WEDNESDAY AND AGAIN ON THURSDAY NIGHT.

CONTINUE TO MONITOR THUNDERSTORMS UPSTREAM MOVING INTO SOUTHERN
MO. THESE STORMS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE
THAT WILL BE MOVING INTO THE MIDSOUTH LATER TONIGHT. CURRENT LAPS
AND RUC DATA SHOWS THESE STORMS MOVING INTO A MORE STABLE AIR MASS
AS THEY APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH. THINK THEY WILL DECREASE IN
COVERAGE AND INTENSITY...THUS 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS
FOR OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES AFTER MIDNIGHT STILL LOOKS GOOD.

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 308 PM CST THU MAR 3 2005) 

DISCUSSION...WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS WESTERN US RIDGE AMPLIFYING 
IN RESPONSE TO DIGGING TROUGH ACROSS THE PACIFIC...AND TYPICAL 
WINTER TIME CANADIAN TROUGHING ACROSS THE EASTERN US. SOME DIURNAL 
CUMULUS FORMED DURING THE MORNING IN RESPONSE TO SOME RESIDUAL LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE AROUND 925 MB. 500 MB UPPER AIR AND WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY SHOWS NEXT SHORTWAVE ACROSS THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
DROPPING SOUTH TOWARDS THE MID SOUTH. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS IN THE 
SHORT TERM IS PRECIPITATION CHANCES TONIGHT AND AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT.

TONIGHT...WEAK SHORTWAVE FROM THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL DROP 
SOUTH IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW...RESULTING IN A CHANCE OF PRECIP ACROSS 
A PORTION OF THE NORTHERN FORECAST AREA. CANNOT RULE OUT A CHANCE OF 
ELEVATED THUNDER WITH 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES WILL STEEPENING 
TO AROUND 7 C/KM...WITH SHOWALTER LIFTED INDICES DROPPING TO AROUND 
0 OR SLIGHTLY BELOW. CURRENT GRIDS HANDLING 20 POPS WELL ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES AS 
BETTER RAIN CHANCES WILL BE FURTHER NORTH.

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL AFFECT THE MID 
SOUTH BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE OF RAIN TO THE FAR NORTHERN TIER OF 
COUNTIES BY LATE AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING HOURS. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THUNDER NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION AT THE ONSET WITH 
ALMOST 1000 J/KG OF CAPE...NEGATIVE LI/S AND SHOWALTER INDICES AND 
MODERATE TO STEEP 700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES /6.5-7.0 
C/KM/. HOWEVER...I THINK THE BIG LIMITING FACTOR WILL BE MOISTURE AS 
DEWPOINTS WILL STRUGGLE TO GET INTO THE LOWER 40S. CONSEQUENTLY...I 
WENT WITH 20 POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER AND SPREADING FURTHER 
SOUTH ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND WESTERN TENNESSEE 
DURING THE EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN ON SATURDAY AND 
RAISED TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY IN ADVANCE OF 
NEXT FRONT TO AFFECT THE AREA BY MONDAY.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...LONG RANGE MODELS MOSTLY IN AGREEMENT 
THROUGH EXTENDED BUT BEGIN TO DIVERGE TOWARDS DAYS 6 AND 7. LATEST 
COUPLE OF RUNS SHOWING PATTERN A LITTLE FASTER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
GFS/CANADIAN SUGGESTING WESTERN RIDGE WILL FINALLY BREAK DOWN WHILE 
LATEST EUROPEAN/NAVY NOGAPS RUN SHOWS RIDGE HOLDING FIRM OR VERY 
SLIGHTLY BREAKING DOWN. AS A RESULT...LONG RANGE FORECAST WILL LEAN 
TOWARDS THE EUROPEAN/NOGAPS SOLUTION TOWARDS DAYS 6 AND 7. 

A COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE MID SOUTH ON MONDAY BRINGING A 
CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS TO THE REGION WITH THE BEST CHANCES OF RAIN 
MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND TAPERING OFF DURING THE EVENING. 
ADJUSTED POPS TO TRIM BACK RAIN CHANCES MONDAY EVENING WITH QUICKER 
PROGRESSION IN LATEST MODEL RUNS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN 
ON TUESDAY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. ANOTHER CLIPPER WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY...RESULTING IN ANOTHER CHANCE OF RAIN...THEN 
HIGH PRESSURE COMING BACK FOR THURSDAY. MADE SOME TEMPERATURE 
ADJUSTMENTS TO LATTER HALF OF EXTENDED WITH LATEST RUN TRENDING A 
BIT WARMER.

C/KM/. HOWEVER...I THINK THE BIG LIMITING FACTOR WILL BE MOISTURE AS 
DEWPOINTS WILL STRUGGLE TO GET INTO THE LOWER 40S. CONSEQUENTLY...I 
WENT WITH 20 POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER AND SPREADING FURTHER 
SOUTH ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND WESTERN TENNESSEE 
DURING THE EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN ON SATURDAY AND 
RAISED TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY IN ADVANCE OF 
NEXT FRONT TO AFFECT THE AREA BY MONDAY.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...LONG RANGE MODELS MOSTLY IN AGREEMENT 
THROUGH EXTENDED BUT BEGIN TO DIVERGE TOWARDS DAYS 6 AND 7. LATEST 
COUPLE OF RUNS SHOWING PATTERN A LITTLE FASTER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
GFS/CANADIAN SUGGESTING WESTERN RIDGE WILL FINALLY BREAK DOWN WHILE 
LATEST EUROPEAN/NAVY NOGAPS RUN SHOWS RIDGE HOLDING FIRM OR VERY 
SLIGHTLY BREAKING DOWN. AS A RESULT...LONG RANGE FORECAST WILL LEAN 
TOWARDS THE EUROPEAN/NOGAPS SOLUTION TOWARDS DAYS 6 AND 7. 

A COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE MID SOUTH ON MONDAY BRINGING A 
CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS TO THE REGION WITH THE BEST CHANCES OF RAIN 
MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND TAPERING OFF DURING THE EVENING. 
ADJUSTED POPS TO TRIM BACK RAIN CHANCES MONDAY EVENING WITH QUICKER 
PROGRESSION IN LATEST MODEL RUNS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK IN 
ON TUESDAY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. ANOTHER CLIPPER WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY...RESULTING IN ANOTHER CHANCE OF RAIN...THEN 
HIGH PRESSURE COMING BACK FOR THURSDAY. MADE SOME TEMPERATURE 
ADJUSTMENTS TO LATTER HALF OF EXTENDED WITH LATEST RUN TRENDING A 
BIT WARMER.

MORNING WITH STRATUS ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI QUICKLY ERODING 
SOUTH OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS. AT THE SAME TIME...DIURNAL 
CUMULUS BEGINNING TO FORM MAINLY IN THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DELTA.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 200 AM CST THU MAR 3 2005.

SHORTWAVE HELPING TO PRODUCE LIGHT RAIN OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF 
THE MIDSOUTH WILL CONTINUE PUSHING SOUTHWARD TODAY. EXPECT RAIN TO 
MOVE OUT OF THE MIDSOUTH BY 12Z. HOWEVER CLOUDS WILL HANG AROUND 
ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA TODAY. EXPECT THERE TO BE A 
TIGHT GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA BETWEEN MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS TO 
THE NORTH AND MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS TO THE SOUTH. EXPECT THE LINE 
WILL BE SOMEWHERE NEAR MEMPHIS. 

AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN IS SETTING UP TO TAKE PLACE ACROSS THE 
MIDSOUTH THIS WEEK. SEVERAL SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE IN AND OUT OF THE 
CWA BETWEEN TODAY AND SATURDAY. THIS WILL BRING OFF AND ON CHANCES 
FOR RAIN TO PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH. MODELS DO NOT HAVE A GOOD 
HANDLE ON TIMING OF THESE SHORTWAVES SO THIS DOESN/T HELP MAKE THE 
FORECAST ANY EASIER. RIGHT NOW... IT LOOKS LIKE NORTHERN SECTIONS 
WILL SEE A SHORTWAVE MOVE THROUGH TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY 
MORNING...WHILE SOUTHERN SECTIONS WILL SEE A SHORTWAVE MOVE THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT. CLOUDS WILL HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES DOWN ACROSS 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH.

BRIEF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND 
ALLOWING FOR DRY CONDITIONS TO OCCUR FOR THE MIDSOUTH DURING THIS TIME.

SEVERAL COLD FRONTS WILL THEN SWING THROUGH THE AREA DURING THE 
BEGINNING TO MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL BRING RAIN CHANCES 
BACK TO THE MIDSOUTH. WOULDN/T BE SURPRISED TO SEE RAIN CHANGE OVER 
TO SNOW BRIEFLY AS PRECIPITATION ENDS(AT LEAST WITH THE SECOND 
FRONT) AS THESE FRONTS MOVE THROUGH THE AREA. MODELS ARE SHOWING 
MUCH COLDER AIR MOVING IN BEHIND THE FRONTS...BUT STILL TOO EARLY TO 
TELL IF ANY SNOW WILL OCCUR ESPECIALLY WITH THE MODEL 
INCONSISTENCIES. RIGHT NOW...LOOKS LIKE FIRST FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH ON MONDAY WITH ANOTHER ONE MOVING THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY. THE 
SHOTS OF COLD AIR LOOK TO BE SHORT-LIVED AT LEAST WITH THE FIRST 
FRONT AS A QUICK WARM UP IS EXPECTED ON TUESDAY.

TO INCREASE  ACRS THE SW PART OF THE CWFA AS WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT 
DEVELOPS ACRS THE LOWER MS VALLEY. ISOLD PRECIP COVERAGE ACRS AR

COMBINATION WILL REMAIN TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA...ACRS LA AND SRN 
MS. ANY PRECIP SHOULD BE LIGHT WITH JUST A FEW HUNDRETHS IN PLACES 
THAT DO SEE SOME RAIN. THE NRN TIER OF THE MID SOUTH PROBABLY WL NOT 
EVEN GO CLOUDY SO EXPECT TEMPS TO FALL BELOW FREEZING FROM THE

DISCUSSION...
THERE WAS A DEEP TROUGH AXIS ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. WITH AN 
AMPLIFIED RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN U.S. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A 
SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING EAST ACROSS NEW MEXICO. COLD AIR ADVECTION WAS 
IN PROGRESS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES 
ARE STRUGGLING TO REACH THEIR FORECAST HIGHS...ESPECIALLY WHERE 
SUFFICIENT CLOUD COVER REMAINS. BRISK NORTHWESTERLY WINDS MAKE IT 
FEEL MUCH COOLER THAN IT ACTUALLY IS.

THE SHORTWAVE OVER NEW MEXICO WILL CONTINUE ITS EASTWARD PROGRESSION 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM WILL COMBINE WITH ANOTHER 
SHORTWAVE THAT WAS ANALYZED ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE CONTINENTAL 
DIVIDE NEAR SOUTH DAKOTA. ADDITIONALLY...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE POOLING 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TEXAS TONIGHT WILL INTRODUCE ITSELF INTO THE 
APPROACHING WAVE. THE RESULT WILL BE WHEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS COME 
TOGETHER WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO PROVIDE A SHOT 
OF RAIN FOR PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. ISENTROPIC SURFACES AT 285K 
AND 290K INDICATE THAT SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE ENOUGH 
TO PRODUCE PRECIPITATION. MODELS DIFFER ON LOCATION/PLACEMENT OF  
THE ACTUAL EVENT WITH THE GFS MUCH FARTHER NORTH. WE FAVOR THE GFS 
PLACEMENT BUT DISAGREE WITH THE COLDER TEMPERATURE PROFILE. BOTH 
MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN THEIR PLACEMENT OF THE RAIN. HAVE 
ADJUSTED RAIN CHANCES A LITTLE FARTHER NORTH WITH THE BEST CHANCES 
OF RAIN STILL PINPOINTED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. 

THURSDAY ANOTHER COOL SHOT OF AIR WILL ENTER THE REGION BUT SHOULD 
NOT AFFECT TEMPERATURES TOO MUCH. NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND A FAST 
MOVING SHORTWAVE IN THE FLOW WILL BRING ANOTHER CHANCE OF RAIN 
FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL BE ALONG AND AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT THAT WILL 
SWEEP ACROSS THE MID SOUTH SATURDAY.

WILL HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYES ON THE CUT OFF LOW OVER NORTHERN BAJA 
SATURDAY NIGHT. THE LATEST GFS KICKS IT OUT MONDAY AND IT BEGINS IT 
APPROACH INTO THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT. LOOKS LIKE THE 
TROPICAL MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL INTERACT WITH THE 
NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH AND COLD FRONT. THIS WOULD PROVIDE THE REGION 
WITH ADDITIONAL RAIN MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. STILL A LONG WAYS 
OUT BUT SOMETHING TO WATCH.

EXPECTED TO REMAIN TO THE SOUTH OF THE CWA...BUT CANNOT RULE OUT A
LITTLE BIT OF RAIN ACROSS ABOUT SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON INTO THURSDAY MORNING. WONT MESS WITH CURRENT POPS.
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE PRECIPITATION WILL REMAIN
LIQUID. DRYING OUT AGAIN THURSDAY.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THURSDAY...ROUGHLY
10 DEGREES ON HIGHS. CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES

TO SEE A FEW READINGS IN THE UPPER TEENS IN NORMALLY COLDER AREAS...

.PREV DISCUSSION... (ISSUED 309 PM CST MON FEB 28 2005) 

DISCUSSION...

SATELLITE AND RADAR SHOWS A BATCH OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION OVER 
WESTERN ARKANSAS MOVING TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST. THIS PRECIPITATION IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE. RADAR LOOP SHOWS THAT 
THE STRONGER ECHOS WOULD GO SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA IF THEY 
MAINTAIN THEIR INTENSITY. THIS JUST LEAVES A CHANCE OF SPRINKLES OR 
FLURRIES SOUTH OF A LINE FROM JONESBORO TO MEMPHIS TO TUPELO THIS 
EVENING. FLURRIES WOULD PROBABLY BE LATER THIS EVENING AND ONLY IF 
THEIR IS STILL ENOUGH MOISTURE AROUND WHEN THE COLDER AIR ARRIVES. 

UPPER LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW CAN BE EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST 
PERIOD AS A RIDGE REMAINS IN TACT OVER THE WEST WITH A TROUGH OVER 
THE NORTHEAST. THIS WILL RESULT IN BELOW NORMAL TEMPS THROUGH THE 
PERIOD. TUESDAY SHOULD BE THE COLDEST DAY DUE TO OUR PROXIMITY TO 
THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH. EVEN WITH SUN...HIGHS WILL ONLY BE IN 
THE 40S. HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE REGION TOMORROW NIGHT 
AND WITH MAINLY CLEAR SKIES...IT SHOULD BE A COLD NIGHT WITH TEENS 
NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION OVER PORTIONS OF WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS. 

THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
COMPLICATED FORECAST WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STILL NEARBY AND 
ASSOCIATED LOW LEVEL DRY AIR IN PLACE. THERE WILL BE AN UPPER 
SHORTWAVE THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. MODELS HAVE MUCH DEEPER 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SHORTWAVE THAN YESTERDAY. SO THERE IS 
SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY HERE. ALSO IF THE 
SYSTEM IS WEAKER THAN TODAYS RUN SUGGESTS THAN THE LOW LEVEL DRY AIR 
WILL LIKELY WIN OUT. MODELS DO AGREE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL MAINLY 
IMPACT NORTHERN MS WITH THE BETTER VERTICAL MOTION MOVING OVER THAT 
REGION. AREAS NORTH OF THE TN/MS BORDER WILL LIKELY REMAIN DRY. 
RIGHT NOW...IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRECIPITATION WOULD REMAIN LIQUID  
HOWEVER IT WILL BE CLOSE. DRY WEATHER CAN BE EXPECTED UNTIL THE 
WEEKEND. THEN ANOTHER FRONT WILL ARRIVE FROM THE NORTH ON SATURDAY 
BRINGING ANOTHER SHOT AT RAIN.

EVENING. FLURRIES WOULD PROBABLY BE LATER THIS EVENING AND ONLY IF 
THEIR IS STILL ENOUGH MOISTURE AROUND WHEN THE COLDER AIR ARRIVES. 

UPPER LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW CAN BE EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST 
PERIOD AS A RIDGE REMAINS IN TACT OVER THE WEST WITH A TROUGH OVER 
THE NORTHEAST. THIS WILL RESULT IN BELOW NORMAL TEMPS THROUGH THE 
PERIOD. TUESDAY SHOULD BE THE COLDEST DAY DUE TO OUR PROXIMITY TO 
THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH. EVEN WITH SUN...HIGHS WILL ONLY BE IN 
THE 40S. HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE REGION TOMORROW NIGHT 
AND WITH MAINLY CLEAR SKIES...IT SHOULD BE A COLD NIGHT WITH TEENS 
NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION OVER PORTIONS OF WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS. 

THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
COMPLICATED FORECAST WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STILL NEARBY AND 
ASSOCIATED LOW LEVEL DRY AIR IN PLACE. THERE WILL BE AN UPPER 
SHORTWAVE THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. MODELS HAVE MUCH DEEPER 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SHORTWAVE THAN YESTERDAY. SO THERE IS 
SOME QUESTIONS IN TERMS OF RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY HERE. ALSO IF THE 
SYSTEM IS WEAKER THAN TODAYS RUN SUGGESTS THAN THE LOW LEVEL DRY AIR 
WILL LIKELY WIN OUT. MODELS DO AGREE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL MAINLY 
IMPACT NORTHERN MS WITH THE BETTER VERTICAL MOTION MOVING OVER THAT 
REGION. AREAS NORTH OF THE TN/MS BORDER WILL LIKELY REMAIN DRY. 
RIGHT NOW...IT LOOKS LIKE THE PRECIPITATION WOULD REMAIN LIQUID  
HOWEVER IT WILL BE CLOSE. DRY WEATHER CAN BE EXPECTED UNTIL THE 
WEEKEND. THEN ANOTHER FRONT WILL ARRIVE FROM THE NORTH ON SATURDAY 
BRINGING ANOTHER SHOT AT RAIN.

AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER ARKANSAS CONTINUES TO MOVE
EAST. RAIN HAS BEEN SLOW TO BEGIN ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE AREA DUE
TO DRIER AIR IN THE LOW LEVELS. THE EXCEPTION HAS BEEN ACROSS
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI...WHERE DEEPER MOISTURE HAS WORKED IN AHEAD OF
THE SURFACE LOW MOVING OUT OF THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO AND
WIDESPREAD RAIN HAS FALLEN FOR MOST OF THIS AFTERNOON. THE LOW
LEVELS SHOULD MOISTEN ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA THIS EVENING
WITH RAIN EXPECTED LATER TONIGHT.

.SHORT-TERM (TONIGHT-TUESDAY)...

THE SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY MORNING. THIS WILL
ALLOW RAIN TO OVERSPREAD THE MID SOUTH AS THE LOW LEVELS CONTINUE
TO MOISTEN. THIS SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE EAST OF THE
AREA BY MONDAY MORNING. THE RAIN SHOULD COME TO AN END AS THIS
SYSTEM DEPARTS TO THE EAST.

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS
STATES IN THE NORTHERN STREAM WILL DIVE ACROSS THE AREA BEHIND THE
SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM ON MONDAY. THIS NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE WILL
SEND A STRONG COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH BY MONDAY EVENING AND
USHER IN A MUCH COLDER CANADIAN AIRMASS. TEMPERATURES WILL FALL INTO
THE MID 20S NORTH TO AROUND 30 SOUTH ON MONDAY NIGHT AS STRONG COLD
ADVECTION PICKS UP OVER THE REGION. COLD WEATHER WILL CONTINUE ON
TUESDAY WITH 850 MB TEMPS RANGING FROM -5C SOUTHWEST TO AROUND -10C
NORTHEAST. DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY.

.LONG-TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT-SUNDAY)...

BOTH THE NAM/GFS INDICATING A RETURN FLOW/WARM ADVECTION PATTERN
SETTING UP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON.
WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT WAS NOTED ACROSS NORTHEAST TEXAS INTO
LOUISIANA AND ARKANSAS BY TUESDAY EVENING. THIS WARM ADVECTION
PATTERN AND ASSOCIATED ISENTROPIC LIFT SLIDES EAST TUESDAY NIGHT.
PRECIPITATION SHOULD DEVELOP WITHIN THIS ZONE OF LIFT TO OUR
SOUTHWEST. AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS THAT THE ATMOSPHERE WILL
REMAIN TOO DRY TO SUPPORT PRECIPITATION OVER SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF
OUR AREA...BUT THIS WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED BY LATER SHIFTS...
ESPECIALLY SINCE TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT
FROZEN PRECIP. ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID
SOUTH WEDNESDAY MORNING...BUT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH DRY WITH LIMITED
MOISTURE IN PLACE. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA THROUGH
THE END OF THE WEEK. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW AVERAGE THROUGH
MID WEEK BEFORE SLOWLY MODERATING BY THE END OF THE WEEK...AS WINDS
RETURN BACK OUT OF THE SOUTH. ANOTHER CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEM WILL CROSS

THIS HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM HAS ALLOWED FOR A VERY PLEASANT AFTERNOON
WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND TEMPERATURES WARMING TO THE UPPER 50S
NORTH TO LOWER 60S SOUTH. THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM ORGANIZING OVER
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THIS AFTERNOON WILL BRING A PERIOD OF WET WEATHER
FOR THE END OF THE WEEKEND. DRYER BUT MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL
MOVE IN FOR THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT-TERM (TONIGHT-MONDAY)...

A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS
STATES THIS AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST ACROSS THE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THROUGH SUNDAY. A 120 KT JET STREAK EJECTING
OUT OF THE BASE OF THE TROUGH WILL HELP TO INDUCE A SURFACE LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO...WHICH WILL DEEPEN AND
MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES SUNDAY.
DEEP MOISTURE IN ADVANCE OF THE UPPER TROUGH AND LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM WILL OVERSPREAD THE MID SOUTH ON SUNDAY MORNING. RAIN CHANCES
WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA TOMORROW MORNING AND BECOME LIKELY BY
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AS THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSES THE REGION. THIS
RAIN WILL CONTINUE INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...BEFORE TAPERING OFF TO LIGHT
RAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE SURFACE LOW AND ASSOCIATED SHORTWAVE
TROUGH DEPART TO THE NORTHEAST.

IN THE MEANTIME...THE ADVERTISED BLOCKING PATTERN OVER THE NORTHERN
ATLANTIC WILL HELP TO SEND A NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH
DIVING SOUTH FROM SASKATCHEWAN CANADA ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS
STATES ON SUNDAY. PRECEDING THIS NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE WILL BE A
STRONG COLD FRONT WITH A MODIFIED ARCTIC AIRMASS BEHIND IT. THE COLD
FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY MORNING. MOST OF
THE DEEP MOISTURE WILL HAVE SWEPT TO THE EAST WITH THE LEAD SOUTHERN
STREAM SYSTEM...BUT THERE MAY BE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO
PRODUCE SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE FRONT. BEHIND THE
FRONT...COLDER TEMPERATURES WILL FILTER SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA.
HIGH TEMPERATURES ON MONDAY SHOULD ACTUALLY BE REACHED LATE IN THE
MORNING BEFORE FALLING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS STRONG COLD
ADVECTION BEGINS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA
LATER ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT.

.LONG-TERM (TUESDAY-SATURDAY)...

THE EASTERN U.S. LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE REMAINDER

A REINFORCING SHOT OF COOL AIR MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. THE
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW IN BOTH THE LOW LEVELS AND ALOFT SHOULD KEEP
MOISTURE SUPPRESSED WELL TO THE SOUTH THROUGH WEDNESDAY. LOW LEVEL
FLOW WILL RETURN BACK OUT OF THE SOUTH ON THURSDAY. ANOTHER NORTHERN

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED OVER THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON.
THIS HAS ALLOWED FOR MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND COOL TEMPERATURES WITH
LIGHT NORTH WINDS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA TONIGHT
BEFORE SLIDING EAST ON SATURDAY.

.SHORT-TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT-MONDAY NIGHT)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA TONIGHT WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY
CLEAR FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT. THIS COMBINED WITH LIGHT
WINDS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO FALL OFF FAIRLY QUICKLY AFTER
SUNSET. THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO TURN MORE
SOUTHWESTERLY LATER TONIGHT AND THIS MAY ALLOW SOME HIGH LEVEL
MOISTURE AND ASSOCIATED CIRRUS CLOUDS TO STREAM OVER WESTERN AREAS
AFTER MIDNIGHT. THESE CLOUDS MAY BE ENOUGH TO KEEP TEMPERATURES
FROM BOTTOMING OUT LIKE LAST NIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN
SECTIONS.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE EAST ON SATURDAY WITH LOW LEVEL
WINDS TURNING BACK OUT OF THE SOUTHEAST. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR LOW
LEVEL WARM ADVECTION TO RETURN ON SATURDAY...WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES
WARMING SEVERAL DEGREES WITH UPPER 50S NORTH TO LOWER 60S SOUTH.
UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM OVER THE AREA UNDER
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...SO EXPECT MORE HIGH CLOUDS ON SATURDAY.
CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO LOWER AND THICKEN BY SATURDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF
THE NEXT APPROACHING STORM SYSTEM.

AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE OVER THE DESERT SOUTHWEST THIS AFTERNOON
(AS SEEN ON 21Z WATER VAPOR IMAGERY) IS PROGGED BY BOTH THE
NAM/GFS TO MOVE EAST AND WEAKEN TO AN UPPER TROUGH THIS WEEKEND. AS
THIS SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM EJECTS OUT ACROSS THE PLAINS ON
SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...IT WILL HELP TO INDUCE A SURFACE LOW
PRESSURE IN THE NORTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO. THIS SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE
NORTHEAST AND DEEPEN AS IT MOVES ACROSS MISSISSIPPI ON SUNDAY AND
SUNDAY NIGHT. DEEP MOISTURE WILL SURGE NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF OF
MEXICO AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. EXPECT RAIN TO BREAK OUT ACROSS THE
AREA BY SUNDAY MORNING AND PERSIST THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.

IN THE MEANTIME...A BLOCKING RIDGE WILL STRENGTHEN OVER PORTIONS OF
THE NORTH ATLANTIC IN THE VICINITY OF GREENLAND OVER THE WEEKEND
WITH THE POLAR VORTEX OVER EASTERN ONTARIO RETROGRADING BACK TO THE
WEST. THIS BLOCKING PATTERN WILL FORCE A NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE
TROUGH NOW OVER NORTHERN BRITISH COLUMBIA CANADA TO DIVE SOUTHEAST
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES ON SUNDAY AND INTO THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON MONDAY. THIS NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE WILL
SEND A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA ON MONDAY...WITH A MODIFIED ARCTIC
AIRMASS FOLLOWING THE FRONT FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. THIS WILL
MEAN COLDER TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED BY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND
ESPECIALLY MONDAY NIGHT. ALL OF THE RAIN WILL COME TO AN END AFTER
THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT ON MONDAY.

.LONG-TERM (TUESDAY-FRIDAY)...
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL PERSIST THROUGH MID WEEK WITH ANOTHER
NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHING IN THE FLOW ALOFT
ON WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL SEND ANOTHER COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA
ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN LIMITED WITH THIS
SYSTEM SO HAVE INCLUDED ONLY A 20 POP FOR SHOWERS WEDNESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW THIS FRONT WITH SLIGHTLY

(ECMWF/GFS/UKMET) INDICATING A BLOCKING UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDING OVER GREENLAND FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL
FORCE A COLD AIRMASS OVER NORTHERN CANADA TO MOVE SOUTHWARD
PRECEDED BY A POTENT NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH BY THE
BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. THIS NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE WILL ATTEMPT
TO PHASE WITH A WEAKENING UPPER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHERN
STREAM MOVING EAST OUT OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST. THE NORTHERN
STREAM SHORTWAVE WILL SEND A STRONG SURFACE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE
AREA ON MONDAY. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD INCREASE AHEAD OF
THIS SYSTEM TO ALLOW FOR SHOWERS TO DEVELOP FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO
MONDAY. THEREFORE...HAVE KEPT CURRENT FORECAST POPS GOING...WITH 30
POP SUNDAY NIGHT AND 40 POPS ON MONDAY.

BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...COLD TEMPERATURES WILL FILTER INTO THE
AREA. TEMPERATURES SHOULD SLOWLY FALL BY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND ON
TUESDAY WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH THE LOW TO MID 40S. THE DEEP EASTERN
TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST FOR THE SECOND HALF OF NEXT WEEK WITH THE
UPPER FLOW FLATTENING OUT AND TEMPERATURES REBOUNDING. DRY
CONDITIONS WILL ALSO PERSIST FOR TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS CENTERED OVER THE EASTERN PLAINS STATES
THIS MORNING WILL CONTINUE TO SWING EAST OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE
DAY. AHEAD OF THIS UPPER TROUGH A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED
OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...AS INDICATED BY KNQA RADAR. THESE SHOWERS
REMAIN ISOLATED IN COVERAGE AND HAVE SHOWN A WEAKENING TREND
THROUGH THE MORNING. PLAN TO UPDATE PRECIP GRIDS TO REMOVE MENTION
OF FROZEN...AS TEMPS HAVE REMAINED ABOVE FREEZING AND SHOULD THROUGH
THE DAY. ALSO WILL CARRY 20 POPS OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL THROUGH 18Z TO ACCOUNT FOR ONGOING SHOWERS...AND
WILL ADD SPRINKLES FOR THIS AFTERNOON FOR WEST TENNESSEE AND EXTREME
NORTH MISSISSIPPI AS TROUGH CONTINUES SWINGING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH.
ALL OTHER GRID PARAMETERS LOOK GOOD SO WILL NOT CHANGE.

.DISCUSSION...

SURFACE MAP PLACES AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL ALABAMA WITH 
TRAILING COLD FRONT ALONG THE GULF COAST. ALOFT...AN UPPER TROUGH IS 
DIGGING INTO THE REGION. THIS TROUGH HAS SOME COLDER AIR WITH IT AND 
AHEAD OF THE TROUGH THERE IS ENOUGH LIFT FOR SOME LIGHT 
PRECIPITATION FROM SOUTHERN MISSOURI AND ARKANSAS. 

THIS AREA OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION EARLY 
THIS MORNING. GFS AND ETA INDICATE THAT THE BETTER LIFT AND DEEPER 
MOISTURE IS ACROSS WEST TN INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. HAVE SOME LOW 
POPS IN THESE AREAS WITH SPRINKLES POSSIBLE ELSEWHERE. THE REGION 
WILL BE EXPERIENCING GOOD COLD AIR ADVECTION ALL DAY TODAY. NORTH OF 
A LINE FROM JONESBORO TO DYERSBURG TO PARIS THE AIR ENOUGH COLD AIR 
MAY ARRIVE FOR SOME SNOWFLAKES TO MIX IN WITH THE RAIN/DRIZZLE. THE 
FREEZING LEVEL IS ABOUT 1000FT ALTHOUGH SURFACE TEMPS ARE TOO WARM 
FOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS AND PRECIPITATION SHOULDNT BE THAT MUCH 
ANYWAY. LIQUID EQUIVALENT WILL PROBABLY BE ONLY ONE OR TWO 
HUNDRETHS. CLOUD COVER SHOULD HANG AROUND THE BETTER PART OF THE 
DAY...POSSIBLY BREAKING OUT OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS LATE IN THE DAY. 
TEMPS TODAY WILL ONCE AGAIN BE COOL DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND COLD AIR 
ADVECTION. SOUNDINGS SHOW DRIER AIR WORKING INTO THE REGION DURING 
THE EVENING AS HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES IN OVER THE AREA. WITH CLEARING 
SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS...BY DAWN TEMPS MAY BE IN THE UPPER 20 AND 
LOWER 30S.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL OVER THE WEEKEND WITH THE ONLY 
CLOUD COVER IN THE WAY OF CIRRUS. TEMPS SHOULD GRADUALLY RECOVER 
INTO THE MID AND UPPER 50S THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS THE THERMAL TROUGH 
PULLS AWAY FROM THE AREA. DEPENDING UPON HOW THICK THE CIRRUS 
IS...FRIDAY NIGHT COULD BE ANOTHER COLD NIGHT WITH LIGHT WINDS DUE 
TO THE POSITION OF THE SURFACE HIGH. 

THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM ARRIVES LATE IN THE WEEKEND AND EARLY 
NEXT WEEK WHEN A RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE WEST COAST AND KICKS THE 
UPPER LOW THAT IS CURRENTLY OVER THAT AREA OUT. THERE IS A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF RAIN SUNDAY NIGHT AS A WEAK SHORTWAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH. THE BETTER CHANCE WILL BE ON MONDAY WHEN A 
STRONG COLD FRONT RACES THROUGH THE AREA. THE AIR BEHIND THIS FRONT 
IS COMING DOWN OUT OF CENTRAL CANADA. IF THE STRENGTH OF THIS COLD 
AIR IS AS STRONG AS THE GFS IS ADVERTISING...THEN TEMPS ON TUESDAY 
WOULD BE AT LEAST 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL AND PERHAPS AS MUCH AS 15 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.

.UPDATED DISCUSSION...
UPDATED TODAYS FORECAST BASED UPON RADAR TRENDS WITHIN THE LAST 
HOUR. RADAR SHOWS A SOLID LINE OF RAIN AND LIGHTNING ACTIVITY ACROSS 
ALL OF WESTERN ARKANSAS MOVING EASTWARD. THE LIGHTNING ACTIVITY 
APPEARS TO BE DUE TO ELEVATED INSTABILITY. GIVEN PROXIMITY OF 
LIGHTNING STRIKES TO THE AREA...GAVE A MENTION OF A RUMBLE OF 
THUNDER POSSIBLE. ESTIMATE THE RAIN TO ARRIVE THIS MORNING. ALSO 
RAISED POPS OVER ALL OF WEST TENNESSEE TO LIKELY BASED UPON THE 
DEGREE OF COVERAGE OVER ARKANSAS.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
SURFACE FRONT IS ORIENTED NEAR THE GULF COAST THIS MORNING. A STRONG 
UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE IS MOVING OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS 
SHORTWAVE IS RESPONSIBLE FOR AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MOVING INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. THE HIGH CLOUDS FROM 
THESE STORMS HAS MOVED OVER THE REGION. WINDS ARE OUT OF THE 
NORTHEAST IN RESPONSE TO HIGH PRESSURE OVER ILLINOIS. 

UPPER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. LIS AND CAPE SHOW THAT ATMOSPHERE IS VERY STABLE AND MID 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE NOT TOO SUPPORTIVE OF THUNDER. EXPECT 
LIGHTNING ACTIVITY TO DECREASE OVER ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. EASTERLY 
WINDS IN THE LOW LEVELS MAY INHIBIT THE ONSET OF RAINFALL FOR A 
SHORT TIME AS DRY AIR IS PUMPED INTO THE SYSTEM. HOWEVER THE 
STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD EVENTUALLY WIN OUT WITH MOST LOCATIONS 
SEEING RAIN TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE RAIN SHOULD FIRST ARRIVE INTO 
AREAS ALONG AND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY LATE MORNING OR 
AROUND NOON AND WORK ITS WAY EASTWARD THROUGHOUT THE DAY. HAVE 
SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS EAST OF JACKSON DUE TO TIMING CONCERNS WITH 
RESPECT TO THE DRY EASTERLY WINDS. TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE 
IMPACTED BY THE NEUTRAL TEMP ADVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE EASTERLY 
WINDS...CLOUD COVER AND ESPECIALLY WHEN THE RAINFALL ARRIVES.

TONIGHT...MOST LOCATIONS SHOULD STILL HAVE SOME RAIN AROUND DURING 
THE EVENING BUT BY MIDNIGHT THE MAIN SHORTWAVE WILL HAVE MOVED EAST 
OF THE AREA. SOUNDINGS SHOWING THAT SOME DRIZZLE MAY STILL LINGER 
BEHIND THIS MAIN AREA OF RAIN. IN TERMS OF WINTRY POTENTIAL NORTH OF 
JONESBORO TO JACKSON...THE SOUNDINGS DO NOT SUPPORT MOISTURE UP TO 
THE -10 DEGREE MARK SO ICE CRYSTAL ACTIVATION IS UNLIKELY. THIS 
RULES OUT SNOW. FINALLY...THE BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS...ALTHOUGH 
CLOSE...LOOK LIKE THEY ARE JUST ABOVE FREEZING. THIS RULES OUT 
FREEZING RAIN OR FREEZING DRIZZLE. STILL...THE SITUATION WILL NEED 
TO BE REEVALUATED ONCE THE 12Z DATA ARRIVES. 

LOOKING AT 925MB MOISTURE FIELDS AND SOUNDINGS...WILL LIKELY HAVE 
LOTS OF LOW STRATUS TO CONTEND WITH TOMORROW. CLOUDS WILL PROBABLY 
STICK AROUND JUST ABOUT ALL DAY BEFORE BREAKING UP TOMORROW NIGHT AS 
HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES OVER THE REGION. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN LOCKED OVER THE REGION INTO THE WEEKEND. 
DEPENDING UPON CLOUD COVER AND WIND SPEEDS...OVERNIGHT LOWS COULD BE 
CHILLY WITH TEMPS IN THE 20S POSSIBLE. ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM WILL 
ARRIVE ON MONDAY WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION VARIETY SHOWERS POSSIBLE 
SUNDAY NIGHT BEFORE A STRONG COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON MONDAY. 
ATMOSPHERE STILL LOOKS RATHER STABLE WITH THE FRONT FOR MENTION OF 
THUNDER. THE GFS IS ADVERTISING A GOOD DEAL OF COLD AIR BEHIND THIS 
SYSTEM...WHICH MAY BE A BIT OVERDONE. STILL...HAVE LOWERED TEMPS 
BELOW MEX GUIDANCE IN THE EXTENDED TO ABOUT 8 DEGREES BELOW 
CLIMATOLOGY AS A FIRST GUESS.

UPDATED FORECAST FOR SKY COVER. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOWING LOW 
STRATUS HAS PROGRESSED SOUTHWESTWARD. THESE CLOUDS ARE OBSCURED FROM 
SATELLITE BY A THIN VEIL OF CIRRUS OVERHEAD. CURRENT THINKING IS 
THAT PROGRESS SHOULD SLOW SOON NOW THAT THE SUN IS UP AND THAT BY 
AFTERNOON THE DECK WILL MIX OUT.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
SURFACE MAP PLACES A STATIONARY FRONT FROM NORTHERN GEORGIA THROUGH 
CENTRAL ALABAMA AND MISSISSIPPI THROUGH NORTHERN LOUISIANA AND INTO 
CENTRAL TEXAS. HIGH PRESSURE IS OVER THE UPPER TO MID MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS IS BRINGING NORTHEASTERLY WINDS INTO THE REGION. 
SATELLITE SHOWS A DECK OF STRATUS WITH CEILINGS AT OR JUST BELOW 
1000FT NORTH OF A LINE FROM DYERSBURG TO JACKSON TO SAVANNAH. ALSO 
THERE IS SOME CIRRUS DRIFTING IN FROM A CUT OFF LOW NEAR THE COAST 
OF CALIFORNIA. 

MESOETA MODEL SOUNDINGS THIS MORNING SUGGEST FOG FORMATION FROM THE  
SURFACE MOISTURE FROM YESTERDAYS RAIN AND COOL AIR MOVING IN FROM 
THE NORTHEAST. OBSERVATIONS AT LEAST SO FAR HAVE NOT INDICATED MUCH 
FOG MOST LIKELY DUE TO WINDS STAYING UP BETWEEN 5 AND 10 MPH KEEPING 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER JUST MIXED ENOUGH. PATCHY FOG IS STILL POSSIBLE 
EARLY THIS MORNING AS THE ATMOSPHERE BEGINS TO OVERTURN AT SUNRISE. 
STATIONARY FRONT SHOULD STAY SOUTH OF THE REGION TODAY AND WITH NO 
STRONG IMPULSES MOVING ALONG THE FRONT RAIN CHANCES SHOULD REMAIN 
CONFINED TO NEAR THE FRONTAL ZONE. WILL CONTINUE THE CLOUDY WORDING 
THIS MORNING WHERE THE STRATUS IS HANGING TOUGH. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD 
EVENTUALLY ERODE AWAY HOWEVER THEY MAY STICK AROUND LONG ENOUGH TO 
IMPACT HIGH TEMPS OVER THAT AREA. 

EXPECT INCREASING CLOUDINESS TONIGHT AS A SHORTWAVE WILL EJECT OUT 
OF THE SOUTHWEST. ON WEDNESDAY...THE GFS AND ETA DIFFER SOMEWHAT IN 
THE TIMING OF THE SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE. THE GFS IS ABOUT 6 
HOURS FASTER IN THE PROGRESSION OF THIS SYSTEM ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
US THAN THE ETA. THE GFS LOOKS LIKE IT MAY BE SUFFERING FROM SOME 
CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK PROBLEMS AS IT DEVELOPS AN MCS OVER EASTERN 
TEXAS TUESDAY NIGHT AND RACES THE MCS ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES 
ON WEDNESDAY. THE 06Z ETA SOLUTION DEVELOPS CONVECTION HOWEVER NOT 
AS INTENSE AS THE GFS...RESULTING IN A SLOWER EASTWARD PROGRESSION. 
THIS SLOWER SOLUTION WOULD ALSO ALLOW A TRAILING NORTHERN STREAM 
SHORTWAVE TO TAP INTO SOME OF THIS MOISTURE...DRAWING THE 
PRECIPITATION FURTHER NORTHWARD. FAVORING THE ETA SOLUTION...RAIN 
WOULD RISE UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST DURING THE AFTERNOON ON WEDNESDAY 
WITH BETTER PRECIPITATION CHANCES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE SHORTWAVE 
MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. ATMOSPHERE IS WAY TOO STABLE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH THIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER...ETA SOUNDINGS DO SHOW A 
POSSIBILITY OF RAIN CHANGING OVER TO A BRIEF PERIOD OF WET SNOW 
NORTH OF A LINE FROM JONESBORO TO JACKSON LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. SOIL TEMPERATURES MAY BE TOO WARM FOR 
ANYTHING TO STICK...BUT STILL SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON. THIS 
SYSTEM SHOULD MOVE EAST OF THE REGION DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY. 
HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD BUILD INTO THE REGION RESULTING IN MAINLY DRY 
WEATHER INTO THE WEEKEND.

MAIN STORY TODAY WILL BE THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT LATER TODAY INTO 
TONIGHT. THE STRONG SURFACE LOW OVER CENTRAL KANSAS HAS TIGHTENED 
THE PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE MID SOUTH. THIS HAS CAUSED 
SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS AT THE SURFACE. MOISTURE ADVECTION TAKING PLACE 
JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE WITH 40-50KT SOUTHWESTERLY LOW LEVEL JET. DEW 
POINTS WILL BEGIN TO RISE THROUGHOUT THE DAY TODAY PROVIDING PLENTY 
OF FUEL FOR STORMS THAT FORM. GOOD SHEAR THROUGH THE PROFILE... 
ABUNDANT CAPE...STEEP LAPSE RATES AND AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT 
COULD CAUSE SEVERE WEATHER OVER PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER 
CHALLENGE IS FORECASTING THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER TODAY... 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE MID SOUTH. CURRENTLY CLOUD 
COVER IS QUITE EXTENSIVE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST AND MIDWEST U.S. IF 
CLOUDS BREAK EARLY ENOUGH...SUNSHINE MAY PLAY A ROLE IN THE 
DESTABILIZATION MAKING THUNDERSTORMS A GREATER POSSIBILITY. SEE 
SWODY1 FOR MORE DETAILS ON THIS.

THE FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA EARLY MONDAY MORNING AND STALL OUT 
OVER NORTH MS. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL POOL ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT ALLOWING FOR INSTABILITY AND CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS. A 
SHORTWAVE WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TUESDAY EVENING

AREA NWS RADARS INDICATE VERY WEAK ECHOES OVER MOST OF ARKANSAS WITH 
LIGHT RAIN BEING REPORTED NEAR PINE BLUFF. THE LIGHT RAIN HAS SHOWN 
SIGNS OF RAPIDLY WEAKENING OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. LOW 
LEVELS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH ARE RATHER DRY WITH DEW POINTS RANGING 
FROM THE MID 20S TO MID 30S. SOME LIGHT RAIN AND A FEW SPRINKLES 
WILL BE POSSIBLE TODAY ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN AREAS. WARM 
ADVECTION WILL TAKE PLACE TODAY AND SHOULD OFFSET THE LACK OF 
SUNSHINE TO MAKE DAYTIME TEMPERATURES SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY. 

WILL BE WATCHING A SHORTWAVE IN THE SUBTROPICAL STREAM DRIFTING 
ACROSS EAST TEXAS TODAY. THIS WAVE WILL BISECT THE MID SOUTH BRINING 
A GOOD CHANCE FOR RAIN SHOWERS OVERNIGHT. ANOTHER WAVE IS STILL 
PROGGED TO FOLLOW IN THE FOOTSTEPS FOR SUNDAY. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
RETURN WILL PERSIST MAKING THE ATMOSPHERE JUICY FOR THIS TIME OF 
YEAR. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE MILD SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 40S TO LOW 50S.

WITH THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT THERE MAY BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND 
LIFT TO PRODUCE SOME SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER...CURRENT 
MODEL DATA SUGGESTS WEAK LIFT - WHICH IS NOT FAVORABLE FOR 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. WILL HAVE TO WATCH THIS. CURRENT SWODY2 
ALSO AGREES WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY. WILL 
CONTINUE TO MENTION IN THE FORECAST.

THERE WILL BE A COUPLE MORE DISTURBANCES MOVING IN THE SOUTHWEST 
FLOW WHICH WILL BRING CHANCES FOR RAIN EARLY IN THE WEEK. THE LATEST 
GFS ADVERTISES THE FRONT PASSING SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND INTO 
CENTRAL MS TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL PROVIDE LOWER RAIN CHANCES WED

.DISCUSSION...
NO MAJOR SURPRISES EXPECTED WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE. CURRENT 
GOING FORECAST HANDLES UPCOMING WEATHER VERY WELL. ONLY MINOR TWEAKS 
MADE.

TROPICAL MOISTURE CAUGHT IN THE SUBTROPICAL JET WAS STREAMING OVER 
SOUTHERN BAJA INTO TEXAS AND ACROSS PARTS OF THE MID SOUTH. AN UPPER 
LOW SPINNING OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA WILL DRIFT NORTHWARD AND BE 
ABSORBED BY ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM MOVING OUT OF THE GULF OF ALASKA 
THROUGH SATURDAY. MEANWHILE...NORTHWEST FLOW OVER THE SOUTHEAST U.S. 
WILL BRING ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY TO MANY LOCATIONS INCLUDING THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 

THE NORTHWEST FLOW WILL GRADUALLY BECOME MORE ZONAL AS THE UPPER 
LEVELS TRANSITION WITH THE APPROACH OF THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER. 
ADDITIONAL MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BRING INCREASING CHANCES FOR RAIN 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND INTO SATURDAY FOR MOST LOCATIONS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL BE THE FIRST IN A SERIES OF WAVES THAT WILL 
AFFECT THE MID SOUTH.

A STRONG AREA OF SURFACE LOW PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO FORM ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS SATURDAY NIGHT. THE RESULTING SURFACE PRESSURE 
GRADIENT WILL CAUSE WINDS TO INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND ADVECT 
IN MUCH HIGHER DEW POINTS THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL HAVE TO 
KEEP OUR EYES ON THIS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.

THE WET PATTERN WILL PERSIST THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY WITH HIGHER 
RAIN CHANCES DIMINISHING BY MONDAY EVENING. THE MAIN FACTOR ON HOW 
LONG THE RAIN LINGERS WILL BE BASED ON THE POSITION OF THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. SHOULD THE BOUNDARY POSITION ITSELF DIRECTLY OVER THE MID 
SOUTH...MORE WAVES OF RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 
THE WEEK.

ONLY HIGH CIRRUS CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA...MAINLY SOUTH. MOSTLY CLEAR
SHOULD CONTINUE TO TAKE CARE OF THINGS. WILL UPDATE ZFP FOR WIND
WORDING...AS CONDITIONS HAVE GONE LIGHT AND VARIABLE IN MOST AREAS.

WILL NEED TO MONITOR OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES. LOW DEWPOINTS AND
LIGHT WINDS MAY ALLOW TEMPS TO FALL BELOW CURRENTLY FORECAST LEVELS.
SEVERAL SPOTS ARE ALREADY WITHIN 5 TO 7 DEGREES OF FORECAST LOWS...
WITH MOST OF THE NIGHT TO GO. WILL MONITOR 03Z OBS AND MAKE A FINAL

SKIES ARE MOSTLY SUNNY OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON
AS HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD IN ACROSS THE REGION. THE SURFACE
HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK EAST THROUGH FRIDAY. BY SATURDAY MORNING
...SURFACE HIGH IS EAST OF THE REGION ALLOWING SOUTH WINDS TO
RETURN. ALONG WITH THE SOUTH WINDS WILL BE A RETURN OF GULF MOISTURE
AND A CHANCE OF RAIN. RAINY PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MUCH OF
THE WEEKEND AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLOWLY CREEPS TOWARD THE FORECAST
AREA. NEW EXTENDED MODEL RUN HAS FRONT REACHING THE REGION BY MONDAY
AND STALLING OUT WHICH MEANS THREAT OF RAIN WILL CONTINUE MONDAY
THROUGH WEDNESDAY SO HAVE INTRODUCED POPS INTO THE FORECAST FOR

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING CENTERS HIGH PRESSURE 
ACROSS KANSAS AND OKLAHOMA. INFRARED SATELLITE STILL SHOWING CIRRUS 
AND ALTOSTRATUS AFFECTING THE MID SOUTH THROUGH THIS MORNING. 
TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING RANGED FROM THE UPPER 30S NORTH TO MIDDLE 
40S SOUTH. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS THIS FORECAST PACKAGE WILL BE 
CLOUDS AND TEMPERATURES IN THE SHORT TERM AND PRECIPITATION CHANGES 
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.

TODAY...BACK EDGE OF MID/HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY MOVE SOUTH 
TODAY AS HIGH PRESSURE CENTER BEGINS TO MOVE TOWARD THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. HIGHS TODAY WILL NOT BE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN 
YESTERDAY WITH HIGHS MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 50S.  

TONIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVERHEAD ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER 30S AS SKIES BECOME MOSTLY 
CLEAR WITH 1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S DROPPING DOWN TO AROUND 25 PERCENT 
AND DECOUPLING WINDS ASSISTING IN RADIATIVE COOLING.  

FRIDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES 
ALLOWING RETURN FLOW TO SET UP ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH. CLOUDS 
WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE DURING THE DAY AND WENT WITH PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES. I ALSO RAISED HIGHS FOR FRIDAY A COUPLE OF DEGREES AS LATEST 
MODEL RUN A BIT WARMER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 

FRIDAY NIGHT...BOTH NAM/GFS MOSTLY IN AGREEMENT WITH APPROACH OF 
GULF MOISTURE INTO THE MID SOUTH AS WARM FRONT BEGINS TO MOVE NORTH 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. GFS IS A BIT SLOWER WITH ONSET OF RAINFALL 
BUT ETA/GFS 300K SURFACE SHOWS DECENT ISENTROPIC ASCENT BY 12Z AND 
20 POPS STILL LOOK GOOD FOR LATE FRIDAY NIGHT. 
 
SATURDAY...WARM FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY 
AND SATURDAY NIGHT. MODEST ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL BE PRESENT...AND 
700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL BE WEAK /BELOW 6 C/KM/. 
SO...WILL NOT PLAN ANY CHANGES TO CURRENT POPS WITH GRIDS HANDLING 
CURRENT TRENDS WELL. THUNDER CHANCES LOOK MINIMAL IF NON-EXISTENT 
WITH SHOWALTER AND LIFTED INDICIES REMAINING WELL ABOVE ZERO. 

SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A TRAILING COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. HAD TO 
INCREASE POPS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AS PAST COUPLE OF MODEL RUNS 
SHOWING FRONT MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH UPPER 
LEVEL FLOW BEING FROM THE SOUTHWEST. AS A RESULT...WILL CARRY 
SCATTERED POPS ACROSS THE NORTH AND LIKELY POPS FAR SOUTHEAST WITH 
POPS LOWERING ACROSS THE AREA BY MONDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BEGIN TO BUILD IN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE MONDAY...BRINGING 
PRECIPITATION FREE WEATHER AT LEAST THROUGH MID WEEK. NOT MUCH 
CHANGE IN TEMPERATURES EXPECTED WITH TEMPERATURES REMAINING MOSTLY 
NEAR MONTHLY CLIMATOLOGICAL NORMALS.

POURING COLDER AIR INTO THE MIDSOUTH. TEMPERATURES WILL DIP TO
FREEZING OR BELOW IN THE ROUGHLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE COUNTY
WARNING AREA AND THE MID 30S FARTHER SOUTH. LOTS OF CLOUDS ARE
STREAMING IN FROM THE WEST ATTM...BUT THEY ARE EXPECTED TO THIN
OUT LATER TONIGHT.

A PORTION OF THE HIGH WILL BUBBLE SOUTH OVER THE AREA THU.
NORTHERLY WINDS WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW. THIS WILL
PROVIDE COOL HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S...BUT LIGHTER
WINDS WILL MAKE IT LESS CHILLY.

THURSDAY NIGHT...THE HIGH EDGES SLIGHTLY FARTHER EAST DUE TO
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. BUT...COLD AIR WILL REMAIN IN PLACE AND LET
FREEZING TEMPS OCCUR AGAIN. WEATHER PATTERN WILL NOT CHANGE MUCH
FRIDAY. UPPER 40S TO MID 50S WILL BE FEATURED AGAIN.

FRIDAY NIGHT THICKER CLDS WILL INVADE SOUTHWESTERN PARTS OF THE
AREA. COLDEST PLACES WILL BE AROUND PARIS WHILE CLARKSDALE
RESIDENTS NOTICE LOWS IN THE UPPER 30S. LIGHT RAIN COULD DEVELOP
IN WESTERN COUNTIES LATE IN THE NIGHT.

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT ARE APPROACHING THE
MS RIVER THIS MORNING. SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE
LOCATED WELL AHEAD OF THE FRONT FROM THE EASTERN PART OF WEST TN
INTO NORTHEAST MS. CLEARING SKIES HAVE ALREADY SPREAD INTO EASTERN
AR.

THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS LOOK VERY NICE WEATHERWISE...ESPECIALLY FOR
THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY. THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE EAST
OF OUR AREA BY SUNRISE WITH SKIES CLEARING FROM THE WEST. LOWER
DEWPOINTS WILL SPREAD INTO THE MIDSOUTH AS WINDS TURN TO THE WEST.
THE AIR MASS FOLLOWING THE FRONT IS OF PACIFIC ORIGIN AND WE WILL
ACTUALLY SEE WARMER TEMPERATURES TODAY THAN YESTERDAY WITH MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES THIS AFTERNOON.

IT WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR AND COOL TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE
TO THE EAST ALLOWING FOR A LIGHT SOUTH WIND ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH.
TUESDAY WILL BE EVEN WARMER THAN TODAY WITH HIGHS CLIMBING INTO THE
LOWER 70S. SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL PUSH 850 MB TEMPERATURES TO AROUND
12 DEGREES C.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTH TUESDAY
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY ACCOMPANIED BY A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. THE GFS IS
FASTER THAN THE NAM ON TIMING OF THE FRONT WHICH WILL MAKE A
DIFFERENCE ON TIMING OF THE SHOWERS...AND ESPECIALLY ON HIGHS FOR
WEDNESDAY. ATTM...WILL COMPROMISE ON TIMING. WILL HAVE A CHANCE OF
SHOWERS SPREADING INTO THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTHWEST TUESDAY NIGHT.
WILL LEAVE IN A 40 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR NORTH MS
WEDNESDAY...20 PERCENT ELSEWHERE FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING.

COLDER AND DRY AIR WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTH. THE NEXT CHANCE FOR
RAIN WILL COME FRIDAY OR FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE HIGH MOVES EASTWARD AND
A WARM FRONT DEVELOPS TO THE SOUTHWEST.

INTO NORTHEAST MS. CLEARING SKIES HAVE ALREADY SPREAD INTO EASTERN
AR.

THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS LOOK VERY NICE WEATHERWISE...ESPECIALLY FOR
THE MIDDLE OF FEBRUARY. THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE EAST
OF OUR AREA BY SUNRISE WITH SKIES CLEARING FROM THE WEST. LOWER
DEWPOINTS WILL SPREAD INTO THE MIDSOUTH AS WINDS TURN TO THE WEST.
THE AIR MASS FOLLOWING THE FRONT IS OF PACIFIC ORIGIN AND WE WILL
ACTUALLY SEE WARMER TEMPERATURES TODAY THAN YESTERDAY WITH MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES THIS AFTERNOON.

IT WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR AND COOL TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE
TO THE EAST ALLOWING FOR A LIGHT SOUTH WIND ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH.
TUESDAY WILL BE EVEN WARMER THAN TODAY WITH HIGHS CLIMBING INTO THE
LOWER 70S. SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL PUSH 850 MB TEMPERATURES TO AROUND
12 DEGREES C.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTH TUESDAY
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY ACCOMPANIED BY A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. THE GFS IS
FASTER THAN THE NAM ON TIMING OF THE FRONT WHICH WILL MAKE A
DIFFERENCE ON TIMING OF THE SHOWERS...AND ESPECIALLY ON HIGHS FOR
WEDNESDAY. ATTM...WILL COMPROMISE ON TIMING. WILL HAVE A CHANCE OF
SHOWERS SPREADING INTO THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTHWEST TUESDAY NIGHT.
WILL LEAVE IN A 40 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR NORTH MS
WEDNESDAY...20 PERCENT ELSEWHERE FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING.

COLDER AND DRY AIR WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTH. THE NEXT CHANCE FOR
RAIN WILL COME FRIDAY OR FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE HIGH MOVES EASTWARD AND
A WARM FRONT DEVELOPS TO THE SOUTHWEST.

COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL MISSOURI INTO NORTHWEST ARKANSAS. 
REGIONAL RADAR IS SHOWING VERY LITTLE DEVELOPMENT OVER ARKANSAS THIS 
EVENING. WITH THE SUN DOWN AND THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMING MORE 
STABLE...DO NOT EXPECT ANY THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY AND BASED UPON 
RADAR TRENDS EXPECT SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH THE FRONT AS IT MOVES

.DISCUSSION...
A RATHER COMPLEX PATTERN EVOLVING THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS
EVENING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH...WITH A NEGATIVELY TILTED UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE WEST WITH SEVERAL SHORTWAVES EMBEDDED
WITHIN THE UPPER TROUGH. ONE OF THE MORE DISTINCT SHORTWAVE
FEATURES IS MOVING ACROSS TEXAS AND HAS HELPED TO DEVELOP CONVECTION
ALONG THE UPPER TEXAS COAST THIS AFTERNOON. ANOTHER MORE SUBTLE
SHORTWAVE FEATURE IS MOVING ACROSS KANSAS THIS AFTERNOON. THIS
SHORTWAVE FEATURE IN ASSOCIATION WITH A COLD FRONT MAY ACT TO TRIGGER
CONVECTION LATER THIS EVENING ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST
AREA. THE BIG QUESTIONS STILL CREATING MUCH UNCERTAINTY IN THE
FORECAST ARE THE AMOUNT OF FORCING FROM THESE POSSIBLE TRIGGERING
MECHANISMS (FRONT & KANSAS SHORTWAVE) AND THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY
THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT...CONSIDERING
TIMING OF SYSTEM (NIGHT-TIME).

.SHORT-TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
A STRENGTHENING SURFACE LOW PRESSURE NOW MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN
MISSOURI WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT NORTHEAST INTO THE WESTERN GREAT
LAKES REGION OVERNIGHT. A WARM FRONT STRETCHED SOUTH FROM THIS LOW
REMAINS DRAPED ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI THIS
AFTERNOON. THIS FRONT SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST TONIGHT...
PLACING MOST OF THE MID SOUTH IN A SOMEWHAT MODIFIED GULF AIRMASS...
WITH TEMPERATURES REMAINING IN THE LOW 60S AND DEWPOINTS IN THE
UPPER 50S. A COLD FRONT EXTENDS SOUTH OF THE SURFACE LOW ACROSS EAST
KANSAS...EAST OKLAHOMA...AND NORTHEAST TEXAS. THIS COLD FRONT WILL
CONTINUE TO ADVANCE EAST TONIGHT AS THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHEAST. AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES EAST ACROSS
ARKANSAS TONIGHT AND THE SUBTLE SHORTWAVE FEATURE NOW OVER KANSAS
MOVES EAST...A LINE OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD
DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT.

THE THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER CONTINUES TO LOOK LESS LIKELY FOR THIS
EVENING AS WE LOOSE THE ASSISTANCE OF DAYTIME HEATING AND INSTABILITY
APPEARS TO REMAIN LIMITED. STRONG WIND FIELDS REMAIN IN PLACE OVER
THE AREA...WITH SUFFICIENT AMOUNTS OF DEEP LAYER SHEAR AND STRONG
LOW-LEVEL HELICITY. SHEAR PROFILES ARE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT TO
SUPPORT SEVERE STORMS. LOW CAPE VALUES WILL WORK AGAINST THE
DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS. IF THUNDERSTORMS CAN INITIATE...THEY
WOULD BECOME SEVERE DUE TO SHEAR VALUES. WITH POOR LEVELS OF
INSTABILITY EXPECTED THOUGH...SO NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF
SEVERE WEATHER. IF A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS DO DEVELOP THIS
EVENING THEY WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED...ESPECIALLY WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER.

THE COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP EAST OF THE AREA BY EARLY MONDAY MORNING.
HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCES FOR RAIN IN THE FORECAST ACROSS EASTERN
SECTIONS. EVERYONE WILL BE DRY BY MONDAY AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT
CLEARS EAST OF THE ENTIRE MID SOUTH AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER
THE AREA THROUGH TUESDAY. THIS WILL KEEP DRY WEATHER IN PLACE
THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON. THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN ZONAL
BEHIND TONIGHTS SYSTEM...WITH THE AIRMASS BEING OF PACIFIC ORIGIN.
THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM BEHIND THE FRONT TO WELL ABOVE
SEASONAL AVERAGES FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY AFTERNOONS.

THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE MID SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT. HAVE
INCLUDED A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS AS
INSTABILITY INCREASES A BIT AHEAD OF THE FRONT. CHANCES FOR SHOWERS
AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI AS
THE FRONT CONTINUES TO CLEAR SOUTH OF THE AREA.

.LONG-TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
POLAR HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN BEHIND WEDNESDAYS COLD FRONT
BRINGING A RETURN TO DRY WEATHER AND COLDER TEMPERATURES (BELOW
SEASONAL NORMALS). THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH ON FRIDAY WITH
MORE RAIN CHANCES ANTICIPATED. THIS FRONT WILL STALL ACROSS THE
AREA NEXT WEEKEND WITH WEAK WAVES DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT. THIS
WILL KEEP WET WEATHER IN THE FORECAST THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND WITH
NEAR AVERAGE TEMPERATURES EXPECTED.

HAVE DECIDED TO UPDATE THE POP FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON...LOOKING
AT LATEST TRENDS. APPEARS THAT MORE SIGNIFICANT THUNDERSTORM
DEVELOPMENT ACROSS WESTERN ZONES WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL LATER THAN
ORIGINALLY ANTICIPATED. THINKING THAT THIS WILL BE DELAYED SOMEWHAT
WITH MORE SIGNIFICANT POPS AFTER 00Z. SO WITH THAT IN MIND...
LOWERED TO CHANCE POPS ACROSS ALL WESTERN ZONES. SHORTWAVE MOVING
ACROSS EAST TEXAS HAS ALLOWED FOR A CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OVER NORTHERN LOUISIANA. THIS SHORTWAVE
WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHEAST AND KEEP PRECIP GOING OVER
SOUTHEASTERN ZONES. HAVE RAISED POPS ACROSS THESE AREAS TO REFLECT
THIS TREND.

SOME BREAKS IN CLOUDS NOW SHOWING UP OVER WESTERN ZONES AS WELL.
THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO SURGE INTO THE UPPER 60S THIS
AFTERNOON OVER THESE AREAS. HAVE UPDATED TEMP GRIDS TO REFLECT THIS
AS WELL.

UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONE FORECAST WILL BE SENT SHORTLY.


.DISCUSSION FROM 1038 AM...

REGIONAL RADAR CONTINUES TO SHOW RAIN COMING TO AN END ACROSS MOST
OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. AS OF 16Z...MOST OF THE SHOWERS
WERE MOVING EAST AND ONLY AFFECTING OUR SOUTHEAST ZONES. THIS RAIN
WILL CONTINUE TO END AS A PRONOUNCED MID LEVEL DRY SLOT CONTINUES
TO PUNCH ACROSS THE AREA...AS NOTED FROM MORNING WATER VAPOR
IMAGERY. HAVE UPDATED POP GRIDS TO LOWER POPS ACROSS WESTERN
2/3RDS OF REGION AND TO REFLECT CURRENT PRECIP TRENDS.

CURRENT REGIONAL SURFACE OBSERVATIONS FROM 16Z SHOWING A
STRENGTHENING SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER NORTHWEST MISSOURI
WITH A COLD FRONT STRETCHED TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE LOW ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS. OVER OUR AREA...A WARM FRONT NOW STRETCHED FROM
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS SOUTHWARD INTO WEST-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI WILL
CONTINUE TO ADVANCE SLOWLY EASTWARD ACROSS MAINLY WESTERN PORTIONS
OF THE REGION INTO THIS AFTERNOON. THIS WILL PLACE WESTERN PORTIONS
OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO THE WARM SECTOR...WHERE DEWPOINTS ARE NOW
INTO THE UPPER 50S. 16Z VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATING A FEW
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS. THIS TREND MAY CONTINUE
TO SPREAD OVER OUR WESTERN AREAS BY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...BUT
THINK THAT ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE PRESENT TO KEEP OVERALL
SKY COVER AS MOSTLY CLOUDY. WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS TREND THOUGH
BECAUSE IT WILL PLAY A ROLE IN THIS AFTERNOONS SEVERE WEATHER
THREAT.

AS FOR CHANCES OF SEVERE WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON...NAM STILL SHOWING
INCREASING INSTABILITY ACROSS AREAS TO THE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI
THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS ALSO CONTINUING TO INDICATE SUFFICIENT DEEP
LAYER SHEAR AND LARGE AMOUNTS OF LOW-LEVEL HELICITY THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. THESE STRONG WIND FIELDS REMAIN MORE THAN
SUFFICIENT FOR SEVERE WEATHER. THE BIG QUESTION...AS IS TYPICAL
THIS TIME OF YEAR...REMAINS THE DEGREE OF INSTABILITY. AS MID-LEVEL
COOLING ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVERSPREADS
THE WARM SECTOR THAT SHOULD BE IN PLACE ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF
THE AREA THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND LIFT PRESENT TO ALLOW
FOR ISOLATED STORMS TO BECOME SEVERE. THIS THREAT WILL BE CONFINED
TO AREAS WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND THIS MATCHES WELL WITH
THE NEW 16Z DAY 1 OUTLOOK ISSUED BY SPC.

LARGE SCALE AND NEGATIVELY TILTED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS MOVING
THROUGH THE PLAINS STATES THIS MORNING. WIDESPREAD STRATIFORM RAIN
COVERS THE MIDSOUTH AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH. THE STRATIFORM RAIN WILL
BE SHIFTING EASTWARD THIS MORNING WITH THE PRECIPITATION BECOMING
MORE CONVECTIVE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH DURING THE DAY. STRONG LOW
PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO NORTHERN MO BY SUNSET TODAY WITH A COLD
FRONT TRAILING SOUTHWARD THROUGH NORTH-CENTRAL AR TO NORTHEAST TX.
SPC HAS PLACED THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH IN A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE FOR
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. HOWEVER...
PRESENTLY THINK THE GREATEST THREAT WILL BE ACROSS THE MO BOOTHEEL
AND EASTERN AR...POSSIBLY CROSSING THE MS RIVER. CAPES ARE FORECAST
TO CLIMB TO NEAR 1000 J/KG ACROSS EASTERN AR BY MID-AFTERNOON WITH A
STRONG SHEARING WIND PROFILE. 0-1 KM STORM RELATIVE HELICITY VALUES
ARE FORECAST TO BE AN IMPRESSIVE 300 J/KG WITH 850 MB WINDS
BETWEEN 50 AND 60 KNOTS. AS A RESULT...ISOLATED TORNADOES ARE
POSSIBLE AHEAD OF THE FRONT ACROSS EASTERN AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL BY
MID-AFTERNOON. DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL ARE ALSO POSSIBLE. ALL
OF THIS HINGES ON THE INSTABILITY WHICH WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH THE
CLOUDS BREAK UP THIS AFTERNOON AND HOW MUCH HEATING IS RECEIVED.
THE NAM INDICATES THE INSTABILITY WILL NOT BE AS HIGH EAST OF THE
MS RIVER. TIGHT SURFACE GRADIENT WILL CAUSE SURFACE WINDS TO
INCREASE TO BETWEEN 20 AND 25 MPH TODAY WITH GUST TO BETWEEN 30 AND
35 MPH...ESPECIALLY WESTERN HALF OF THE MIDSOUTH. ATTM...THINK
SPEEDS WILL BE JUST BELOW WIND ADVISORY THRESHOLD...BUT THIS WILL
NEED TO BE MONITORED BY THE DAYSHIFT.

THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT WITH MOST OF
THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EAST OF THE MIDSOUTH BY 12Z MONDAY.
SKIES WILL BECOME MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY MONDAY. THE AIR
MASS BEHIND THE FRONT IS OF PACIFIC ORIGIN SO TEMPERATURES WILL BE
MILD MONDAY.

ADDED A CHANCE OF RAIN TO TUESDAY NIGHTS FORECAST. THE NAM / GFS
INDICATE A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTH
DURING THIS TIME ACCOMPANIED BY SOME RAIN.  WILL LEAVE WEDNESDAY
DRY WITH MODELS DIFFERENCES ON SPEED OF THE FRONT...BUT LATER
FORECASTS MAY NEED TO ADD A CHANCE OF RAIN FOR NORTH MS WEDNESDAY

SHOWING A WARM FRONT DEVELOPING OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. THIS WILL 
KEEP RAIN AROUND THE AREA INTO SUNDAY. THE FRONT WILL PUSH FURTHER 
NORTH BY MIDDAY SUNDAY...WHICH MAY ALLOW FOR A BREAK IN RAIN DURING

CAN NOT RULE OUT THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLY SEVERE DEVELOPING SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON OVER WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH OUT AHEAD OF THE 
COLD FRONT. HOWEVER IF THE LOW CLOUDS DO NOT BREAK UP OVER THE AREA 
DURING THIS TIME...THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LESS LIKELY TO OCCUR. SPC 
HAS PUT A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE STORMS OVER THE THE WESTERN HALF OF 
THE CWA FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
EARLY MONDAY MORNING. SHOULD EXIT THE MIDSOUTH BY MID MONDAY 
MORNING. THIS WILL BRING AN END TO RAIN CHANCES. WITH ZONAL FLOW IN 
PLACE...TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ON THE MILD SIDE.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. 
DRY CONDITIONS WILL BE SHORT-LIVED AS A COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO

MODELS CONTINUING TO SHOW FRONT PUSHING ENTIRELY THROUGH THE CWA 
ALLOWING FOR HIGH PRESSURE TO REBUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. WILL REMOVE ANY MENTION OF 
PRECIPITATION DURING THIS TIME.

THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE AREA FRIDAY

IT IS A CHILLY NIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH TEMPERATURES HAVING
DIPPED INTO THE 30S IN MOST LOCATIONS. SOME CIRRUS IS SPILLING INTO
THE MIDSOUTH OVER A RIDGE CENTERED THROUGH THE PLAINS STATES. THE
UPPER LEVEL LOW THAT WILL BE AFFECTED OUR WEATHER THIS WEEKEND IS
SEEN ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY MOVING THROUGH SOUTHERN CA.

MODELS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT IN THE DEVELOPING WET SCENARIO
FOR THE WEEKEND. THE NAM INDICATES THE MEAN RELATIVE HUMIDITY
INCREASING RAPIDLY TODAY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH AS A WARM FRONT
DEVELOPS TO OUR SOUTHWEST AND ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES ACROSS OUR
AREA. THE MEAN RH AT MEMPHIS IS FORECAST TO GO FROM 20 PERCENT AT 12Z
TO 90 PERCENT AT 00Z. THE LOWER LEVELS ARE QUITE DRY SO WILL TAKE
SOME TIME TO SATURATE. LITTLE IF ANY RAIN IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING...
BUT WILL BE ON THE INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY FROM NORTHEAST
AR ACROSS SOUTHWEST TN INTO NORTHWEST MS.

WIDESPREAD RAIN IS EXPECTED TONIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH AS A UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH MOVES INTO THE PLAINS AND AN ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW
MOVES INTO KANSAS.

THE MIDSOUTH WILL GRADUALLY MOVE INTO THE WARM SECTOR SUNDAY WITH A
COLD FRONT MOVING INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS BY 00Z MONDAY. SPC HAS
PLACED EASTERN AR...THE MO BOOTHEEL...EXTREME WEST TN...AND
NORTHWEST MS IN A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON /
EVENING. ATTM...THINK THE BEST CHANCE OF SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE
ACROSS EASTERN AR...POSSIBLY CROSSING THE MS RIVER. CAPES ARE
FORECAST BY THE NAM TO INCREASE TO NEAR 800 J/KG ACROSS EASTERN AR
DURING THE AFTERNOON WITH 0-1 KM HELICITY IN EXCESS OF 200 M2/S2.
THIS APPEARS TO BE THE AREA MOST LIKELY TO RECEIVE MORE HEATING
DURING THE AFTERNOON AS THE STRATIFORM RAIN SHIFTS TO THE EAST DURING
THE DAY. OBVIOUSLY...THIS WILL CONTINUED TO BE MONITORED BY LATER
SHIFTS.

THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT WITH THE
NAM AND GFS INDICATING MOST OF THE RAIN WILL HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE
MIDSOUTH BY 12Z MONDAY. WILL LEAVE A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR
NORTHEAST MS AND THE EASTERN COUNTIES OF WEST TN FOR MONDAY
MORNING. HOWEVER...THIS MAY BE ABLE TO BE REMOVED IN LATER
FORECASTS DEPENDING ON TIMING OF THE FRONT. IN FACT...MONDAY LOOKS
LIKE A NICE VALENTINES DAY AS THE AIR MASS BEHIND THE FRONT
FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH WILL BE OF PACIFIC ORIGIN. SKIES
WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY SUNNY WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER AND
MID 60S.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL THROUGH TONIGHT. AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...EXPECT A THICKER BAND OF CIRRUS TO BEGIN MOVING INTO 
SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH. THE CIRRUS IS ASSOCIATED WITH 
AN APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE CIRRUS MAY PREVENT LOW 
TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING AS LOW AS PREVIOUS THOUGHT FROM MEMPHIS 
SOUTHWESTWARD. MAY GO A TAD WARMER IN THIS AREA.

CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE ON SATURDAY AS A WARM FRONT 
APPROACHES THE AREA. MODELS ARE NOW SHOWING RAIN BEGINNING A TAD 
EARLIER ACROSS THE AREA. WILL NOW ADD POPS EVERYWHERE FOR SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AND WILL BUMP POPS UP ACROSS WESTERN HALF OF CWA.

WARM FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH CWA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. AS THE 
WARM FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA THERE WILL BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY 
FOR SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO OCCUR SO HAVE ADDED THUNDER TO 
THE FORECAST. WILL ALSO GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT 
FOR THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH AND 70-80 POPS FOR SUNDAY. EXPECT A BREAK IN 
THE PRECIPITATION SUNDAY AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY EVENING BEFORE THE 
COLD FRONT BEGINS TO MOVE INTO THE CWA. COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH 
THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH FOR MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL BRING DRY CONDITIONS BACK TO THE CWA. HOWEVER 
THIS WILL BE SHORT-LIVED AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH 
THE AREA WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL BRING CHANCES FOR RAIN BACK TO THE 
MIDSOUTH. MODELS HAVE CHANGED THE EXTENDED. THEY ARE NOW SHOWING THE 
MIDSOUTH HAVING ANOTHER BREAK FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS 
HIGH PRESSURE MOVES BACK INTO THE AREA. THEN ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM APPROACHES FROM THE WEST THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE END OF 
THE FORECAST PERIOD BRINGING MORE RAIN BACK TO THE REGION. YESTERDAY 
THE MODELS DIDN/T HAVE THE PREVIOUS COLD FRONT MAKING IT ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH AREA SO WILL HOLD OFF ON TAKING PRECIP OUT FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY UNTIL SOME CONSISTENCY OCCURS.

SKIES ARE FORECAST TO REMAIN CLEAR FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT 24 HOURS
EXCEPT FOR PERHAPS SOME CIRRUS. WINDS WILL TURN TO THE WEST TODAY AS
HIGH PRESSURE SINKS TO OUR SOUTH. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A GOOD WARMUP
TODAY WITH HIGHS ABOUT 10 DEGREES WARMER THAN YESTERDAY.
TEMPERATURES WILL NOT BE QUITE AS COLD TONIGHT AS THE WINDS REMAIN
UP SLIGHTLY FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

THE WEATHER WILL BEGIN TO CHANGE SATURDAY BUT LOOKS LIKE MOST OF
THE DAY SHOULD BE PLEASANT FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. CLOUDS WILL
BE ON THE INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST WITH A DEVELOPING WARM FRONT
TO THE SOUTHWEST. MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN SHOWING A TIGHT
GRADIENT OF RAPIDLY INCREASING MOISTURE MOVING INTO THE MIDSOUTH BY
SUNSET SATURDAY. THE LOWER LEVELS WILL REMAIN RATHER DRY
DURING THE DAY SATURDAY SO THINK MOST OF THE RAIN WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL
SATURDAY NIGHT.

SATURDAY NIGHT...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE
LOW MOVES INTO THE PLAINS. MEANWHILE...THE WARM FRONT AND
ASSOCIATED ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL PUSH INTO THE MIDSOUTH WITH RAIN
INCREASING.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS BY LATE SUNDAY AND
MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY MORNING.
PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH WILL MOVE INTO THE WARM SECTOR SUNDAY.
LATER FORECASTS MAY NEED TO ADD A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TO THE
FORECAST FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT...ESPECIALLY WEST AND SOUTH
OF MEMPHIS. THERE ARE MODEL DISAGREEMENTS ON HOW MUCH INSTABILITY
WILL BE AVAILABLE...AND SINCE THIS IS THIS FAR OUT...WILL LET LATER
SHIFTS TAKE A LOOK AT LATER DATA. WILL INCREASE THE POPS FOR SUNDAY
NIGHT SOME WITH THE FRONT FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH DURING THAT TIME.

THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EAST OF THE MIDSOUTH EARLY MONDAY TAKING
THE RAIN WITH IT.

NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO LATER PERIODS OF THE FORECAST. POOR

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL OF THE WEATHER OVER THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS. SKIES WILL REMAIN CLEAR TO MOSTLY CLEAR DURING THIS TIME. 
WINDS WILL BEGIN TO DIE DOWN TONIGHT AS THE HIGH MOVES DIRECTLY OVER 
THE MIDSOUTH. AS THE HIGH SHIFTS EASTWARD ON FRIDAY...WINDS WILL 
SWITCH OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST. WITH THE LIGHT WINDS AND CLEAR SKIES 
TONIGHT...TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE 20S FOR MOST LOCATIONS. AS 
WINDS SWITCH AROUND TO THE SOUTHWEST ON THURSDAY...TEMPERATURES WILL 
REBOUND INTO THE 50S. 

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE DURING THE DAY SATURDAY AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. EXPECT RAIN FROM THE SYSTEM TO HOLD 
OFF UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT. RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE 
REST OF THE WEEKEND AS A WARM FRONT LINGERS NEAR THE CWA.  A COLD 
FRONT WILL THEN PUSH THROUGH THE CWA SUNDAY NIGHT IN TO MONDAY. RAIN 
CHANCES WILL DIMINISH BY MONDAY.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK INTO THE AREA FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY. HOWEVER THIS WILL BE SHORT-LIVED AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
SWINGS INTO THE MIDSOUTH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. MODELS 
SHOWING THIS FRONT STALLING OUT OVER THE CWA WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT BEFORE LIFTING BACK NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT ON THURSDAY. 
THIS WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES IN THE FORECAST FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE
UNITED STATES THIS MORNING. THIS FEATURE WILL HELP KEEP THICKNESSES
LOW OVER THE MID SOUTH TODAY SO TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN COOL.
CLOUDS HAVE CLEARED MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA AS OF 09Z...SO MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES CAN BE EXPECTED THIS MORNING EXCEPT ACROSS FAR EASTERN
SECTIONS WHERE PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE FOR A FEW
HOURS THIS MORNING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...

THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE AREA WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST
TODAY. AGAIN EXPECTING A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY AREAWIDE LATER TODAY WITH
CONTINUED COOL TEMPERATURES.

THE ETA/GFS/ECMWF MODELS ALL INDICATING UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BUILDING
OVER THE AREA FOR FRIDAY AND THE FIRST PART OF SATURDAY. WEATHER
CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN DRY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING. TEMPERATURES
WILL ALSO BEGIN TO MODERATE BEGINNING FRIDAY AS UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS
AND THICKNESSES RISE AND LOW LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION BEGINS.

THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER WILL BE AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
LOCATED OFF THE COAST OF BAJA MEXICO THIS MORNING. THIS SYSTEM IS
PROGGED BY THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS TO MOVE EAST ACROSS THE
SOUTHWESTERN STATES ON SATURDAY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES
BY SATURDAY NIGHT. AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES EAST INTO THE PLAINS
STATES IT IS FORECAST TO WEAKEN TO AN OPEN TROUGH. EXPECT CLOUDS TO
INCREASE DURING THE DAY SATURDAY...WITH CHANCES FOR RAIN BEGINNING
LATER SATURDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA
AS DEEP LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTS NORTHWARD INTO THE MID SOUTH. LOW
LEVEL WARM ADVECTION WILL ALSO CONTINUE...SO EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO
EVEN BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER ON SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)

THE UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES THROUGH
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. THIS UPPER
LEVEL FEATURE WILL HELP DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA ON
MONDAY. GOOD CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY BEFORE
ENDING DURING THE DAY MONDAY AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH. THE
UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN ZONAL FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THE
SHORTWAVE TROUGH...SO NOT EXPECTING MUCH CHANGE IN TEMPERATURES FOR
THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK AS AN AIRMASS OF PACIFIC ORIGIN WILL
FOLLOW THE FRONT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRIEFLY MOVE OVER THE
AREA FOR THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK BRINGING DRY WEATHER. ANOTHER
NORTHERN STREAM IMPULSE IS PROGGED TO SEND ANOTHER COLD FRONT ACROSS
THE AREA BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...BRINGING ADDITIONAL CHANCES

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS BUILDING INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS THIS 
AFTERNOON WHERE THERE WERE SOME GUSTY NORTHWESTERLY WINDS. CLOUDS 
HAVE HUNG ON TIGHT OVER THE MID SOUTH REGION IN THE WAKE OF THE 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH. 

OVERNIGHT...THE COOL...DRIER AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE  
WILL SEEP INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO STRONGER 
SHORTWAVE SWINGING ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT. SKIES WILL 
GRADUALLY CLEAR FROM THE WEST...WITH CLOUDS REMAINING OVER THE 
EASTERN AREAS THROUGH THE NIGHT. AREAS THAT SEE THE CLEARER SKIES 
WILL BE COLDER THAN AREAS WITH CLOUDS...THUS WESTERN AREAS WILL BE 
COOLER THAN EASTERN AREAS. 

WITH THE BROAD TROUGH OVER EASTERN HALF OF THE U.S. THE FORECAST 
AREA WILL FINALLY SEE THE SUN EXPECTING CLEARING SKIES 
THURSDAY...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FRIDAY. DESPITE THE ABUNDANT 
SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES WILL BE JUST BELOW NORMAL TO NEAR NORMAL. THIS 
WILL BE DUE TO SHORTWAVES TRANSLATING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW. 

THE FOCUS SHIFTS WEST SATURDAY AS ABUNDANT SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE IS 
PULLED AHEAD OF A STORM SYSTEM OFF THE SOUTHWEST U.S. COAST. CLOUDS 
WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH SATURDAY IN ADVANCE OF THIS 
SYSTEM. RAIN CHANCES WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE SATURDAY...WITH THE BEST 
CHANCES FOR RAIN OCCURRING SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. RAIN WILL END 
BY NEXT MONDAY NIGHT...FOLLOWED BY NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

TRANSITION TO NORTHWESTERLY...WITH NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT CONTINUING
THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK.

AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM NOW OVER THE SOUTHEAST PACIFIC
OCEAN TO THE WEST OF THE CALIFORNIA COASTLINE IS PROGGED BY THE
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS TO MOVE INTO THE SOUTHWEST U.S. BY THE

TO THE DEPARTING LOW.

TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN STEADY ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH MOST OF
TODAY...AND MAY ACTUALLY FALL A FEW DEGREES LATER THIS AFTERNOON AS
COLD ADVECTION BEGINS IN EARNEST LATER THIS AFTERNOON. THE UPPER
TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO PULL TO THE EAST AND HIGH PRESSURE WILL
BUILD OVER THE MID SOUTH FOR TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. EXPECT DRY
WEATHER FOR THIS TIME PERIOD...WITH CONTINUED COOL TEMPERATURES

A STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDS ACROSS THE SERN PART OF THE 
CWA. FOG WAS PRESENT JUST NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY WITH VISIBILITIES 
BELOW A MILE IN A 50 MILE BAND EXTENDING ACROSS MEM-MKL. A LIGHT 
N-NE WIND WAS OCCURING IN THAT ZONE WITH LOWER DEWPOINTS TO THE 
NORTH. A NE WIND WOULD PROVIDE A NEUTRAL MOISTURE ADVECTION WHILE A 
N WIND WOULD PROVIDE DRY ADVECTION AND DISSIPATE THE FOG. EXPECT THE 
WINDS TO BECOME MORE NORTHERLY...SO DO NOT EXPECT THE FOG TO BE AS 
DENSE AS LAST NIGHT. ALSO...EXPECT CLOUDY SKIES THROUGH THE NIGHT.

A WEAK SFC LOW OVER THE ARKLATEX REGION WILL TRACK EWD ACROSS THE 
LWR MS VLY LATE TONIGHT. THIS COMBINED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE 
WILL PROVIDE A DECENT CHANCE OF RAIN OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY TO THE 
SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE CWA. THE RAIN WILL LINGER IN THE MORNING 
BEFORE MOVING TO THE SE DURING THE DAY.

A COOLER AND DRIER AIRMASS WILL ADVECT INTO REGION WED PM. A SFC 
HIGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA FRI NITE THEN TO THE SE OVER THE 
WEEKEND. A RETURN WAA FLOW WILL PROVIDE THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN SAT 
NITE-SUN NITE. A PACIFIC HIGH WILL PROVIDE DRY AND SEASONABLE 
CONDITIONS EARLY NEXT WEEK.

FRONTAL SYSTEM HAS PRETTY MUCH HUNG UP OVER EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE
CWA. NEAR THE FRONT...THERE IS ABOUT A 75 MILE WIDE AREA WHERE CLOUDS
HAVE THINNED OUT OR BROKEN UP. THIS HAS ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB
ABOVE FORECAST LEVELS ACROSS EASTERN PORTIONS OF CWA. THERE IS A 13
DEGREE SPREAD IN ABOUT 30 MILES ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE...BETWEEN
HUNTINGDON AND LEXINGTON. NO SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION WITHIN 200
MILES OF MEMPHIS.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
TROF LIFTING OUT OF SOUTHWEST U.S. WILL MOVE TO OUR NORTHWEST
OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL EVENTUALLY DRAG THE COLD FRONT THROUGH THE
REST OF THE AREA TOMORROW. ISENTROPIC LIFT AND SATURATION IS NOT AS
STRONG AS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE...AND IT MAINLY OCCURS AFTER MIDNIGHT
TONIGHT. WILL ONLY CARRY SLIGHT POPS FOR 6 PM TO MIDNIGHT TIME
FRAME...AND CHANCE POPS AFTER THAT. RAIN AMOUNTS WILL BE MAINLY
LIGHT...ALTHOUGH EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF CWA COULD SEE UP TO
0.50 INCH...DEPENDING ON EXACT PATH OF WAVE.

WILL HOLD POPS IN...MAINLY DURING THE MORNING ON WEDNESDAY...AS
SYSTEM CLEARS THE AREA. CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE OUT OF THE AREA
BY MIDNIGHT WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND SKIES SHOULD BE PARTLY TO MOSTLY
SUNNY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

DONT SEE MUCH NEED TO MAKE CHANGES TO FORECAST TEMPS THROUGH
THURSDAY. THURSDAY NIGHT TEMPS SIMILAR TO MET SOLUTION...GENERALLY
A LITTLE WARMER THAN MAV GUIDANCE.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER FRIDAY)...
ANOTHER SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM TO AFFECT US OVER THE WEEKEND. TIMING
VARIES AMONG MEDIUM RANGE MODELS. MOISTURE SHOULD MOVE BACK INTO
THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. ECMWF/UKMET/CANADIAN MODELS ALL MOVE THE
SYSTEM THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH A LITTLE QUICKER THAN GFS. WILL GO WITH
THE MAJORITY AND CLEAR THE PRECIP OUT OF THE AREA BY MONDAY
AFTERNOON. HIGH BEHIND THIS SYSTEM IS OF PACIFIC ORIGIN...SO NO
SIGNIFICANT COOLING FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK.

TODAY. HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI
TODAY WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY LINGERING ACROSS REGION. THE NEXT
WEATHER SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE WEATHER ACROSS THE MID SOUTH
LATER TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A

MORNING WITH SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE CONTINUING TO FLOW ACROSS NORTHERN
MEXICO AND INTO TEXAS. THIS SHORTWAVE IS PROGGED BY BOTH THE NAM/GFS
TO PULL EAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES TODAY AND ACROSS THE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT. DEEP MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO RETURN
NORTHWARD OVER THE STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY LATER TONIGHT IN ADVANCE

NORTH WITH THE RAIN AS COMPARED TO THE GFS. IN ANY EVENT...EXPECTING
SOUTHERN AREAS TO SEE THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAINFALL WITH DECREASING
CHANCES FURTHER NORTH. ANY RAIN THAT DOES FALL SHOULD REMAIN ON THE
LIGHT SIDE. THIS SHORTWAVE TROUGH SHOULD MOVE EAST ON WEDNESDAY...

CLOUDS WERE SLOWLY CLEARING FROM WEST TO EAST THIS EVENING. THE LINE 
OF CLOUDS EXTENDED FROM PADUCAH TO DYERSBURG TO FORREST CITY AND 
EASTWARD. OTHER CLOUDS WERE OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH THE UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE. 

RAINFALL CONTINUES TO FALL ACROSS PARTS OF WEST TN AND MAINLY OVER 
NORTHEASTERN MS. THE RAIN WILL MOVE EASTWARD OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
HOURS. BY MIDNIGHT MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE OVER FOR THE 
NIGHT. 

THE COLD FRONT OVER SOUTH/CENTRAL MO IS STILL ON TRACK TO OOZE INTO

COLD FRONT ALONG A STL-DFW LINE EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...AND MAY BE
GETTING HUNG UP IN THE OZARKS. LARGE AREA OF RAIN OVER SOUTHERN
ARKANSAS AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI TRANSLATING ENE. TEMPERATURES
GENERALLY IN THE 50S AT 19Z.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH THURSDAY)...
COLD FRONT FORECAST TO MOVE INTO THE CWA TONIGHT AND BECOME QUASI-
STATIONARY UNTIL SOMETIME ON WEDNESDAY. IMPULSES WILL MOVE ALONG
THE FRONT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING. GFS CONSIDERABLY MORE AGRESSIVE
IN MOVING FRONT SOUTHEASTWARD...BY ABOUT 100 TO 150 MILES BY
WEDNESDAY MORNING. RAIN AREA ACROSS AR AND MS WILL CONTINUE ITS TREK
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...AND POPS
WILL BE BASED ON RADAR TRENDS. CATEGORICAL BEFORE MIDNIGHT ACROSS
MOST OF AREA...WITH CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE AFTER MIDNIGHT. A
RELATIVE LULL DURING THE DAY TUESDAY...WITH ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE
MENTIONED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA.

TUESDAY NIGHT...MODEL POPS HIGHLY DIVERGENT. MET GUIDANCE HAS
CATEGORICAL POPS ACROSS JUST ABOUT THE ENTIRE AREA...WITH MAV
GUIDANCE IN THE 15 TO 30 PERCENT RANGE. EARLIER FORECAST HAD 40
POPS IN IT...AND THIS SEEMS LIKE A REASONABLE COMPROMISE WITH THE
NEIGHBORS FOR NOW. HOPEFULLY...MODEL GUIDANCE WILL COME A LITTLE MORE
INTO AGREEMENT OVER NEXT RUN OR TWO.

PRECIP SHOULD CLEAR THE AREA WEDNESDAY MORNING AS FRONT FINALLY
PUSHES THROUGH. CLOUDS WILL DECREASE BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THURSDAY
WILL BE DRY.

EXACT LOCATION OF FRONT OVER NEXT TWO DAYS WILL DETERMINE ACCURACY
OF TEMPERATURE FORECAST. THROUGH WEDNESDAY...TEMPS TRENDED TOWARD
GFS SOLUTION...BUT EXPECT FORECAST TO BUST SOMEWHERE...SOMETIME.
DIURNAL SPREADS GENERALLY 10 DEGREES OR LESS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. ETA
SOLUTION WOULD COME AROUND TO NEAR GFS NUMBERS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AND THURSDAY.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER THURSDAY)...
LOW CONFIDENCE IN CURRENT GFS FORECAST SOLUTION WITH SYSTEM TRYING
TO COME OVER THE RIDGE DURING THE WEEKEND. THIS SOLUTION APPEARS TO
BE CONSIDERABLY FASTER THAN UKMET/CANADIAN/ECMWF SOLUTIONS. WILL
CONTINUE MENTION OF PRECIPITATION SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY

SEE LITTLE NEED FOR A MID-MORNING UPDATE TODAY. SYSTEM PROGRESSING
PRETTY MUCH AS FORECAST.

LARGE PORTION OF RAIN AREA IS NOW EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.
STILL HAVE ANOTHER WAVE DOWN TO OUR SOUTHWEST OVER TEXAS...AND SOME
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS. PRUDENT CHOICE IS TO LEAVE
POPS IN WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. NOT SEEING MUCH MENTION OF
THUNDER AT THIS TIME...NOR SATELLITE INDICATIONS OF A DRY SLOT
DEVELOPING. IF CONDITIONS STAY AS THEY ARE...WILL REMOVE MENTION OF
THUNDER WITH AN EARLY AFTERNOON UPDATE.

TEMPERATURES CURRENTLY IN LOW TO MID 50S. WITH NO SUNSHINE...
FORECAST HIGHS MAY BE TOUGH TO ATTAIN. WILL MONITOR FOR POSSIBLE
UPDATE ALONG WITH PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED THUNDER.

DECENT 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROF MOVING ACRS KS THIS MORNING. A SFC
FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM THE LOWER GREAT LAKES SOUTH ACRS MO INTO ERN
OK. A COUPLE OF ILL DEFINED SFC LOWS COULD BE FOUND ALONG THE FRONT.
A LARGE SHIELD OF RAIN COVERED MUCH OF AR THIS MORNING WITH PRECIP
HAVING A TOUGH TIME MOVING ACRS THE RIVER.

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WL MOVE NE OUT OF TX TODAY WITH SFC FRONT PUSHING
SLOWLY SE INTO THE MID SOUTH. EXPECT WIDESPREAD PRECIP AHEAD OF THE
FRONT WITH A LARGE AREA OF DEEP MOISTURE AND STRONG LIFT MOVING ACRS
THE AREA TODAY. PRECIP WL WORK EASTWARD AND TAPER OFF FROM THE
WEST THIS AFTN. STRONG DRY PUNCH MOVING INTO AR LATER TODAY ASSOCD
WITH SHORTWAVE MAY RESULT IN SOME SUNSHINE AHEAD OF THE SFC FRONT
AS IT ARRIVES INTO NE AR LATE THIS AFTN. IT IS A BIT OF A
STRETCH...BUT THERE MAY BE ENUF INSTABILITY FOR SOME ISOLD TSTMS
ALONG THE FRONT BY LATE THIS AFTN. NAM INDICATES LIS AROUND ZERO
THOUGH SFC BASED CAPES REACH 1000 J/KG ACRS CNTRL AR LATE TODAY.
NEWEST MODEL RUNS BACKING OFF ON THE DRY PUNCH A LITTLE ACRS OUR
AREA.

BY 06Z SHORTWAVE AXIS WL BE ALONG THE RIVER WITH SFC FRONT PROBABLY
FROM MKL-OXFORD. WENT WITH HIGH POPS ACRS ERN SXNS DUE TO THE SLOWER
FRONTAL MOVEMENT AND STRONGER 500 MB SHORTWAVE. AFTER 06Z PRECIP WL
TAPER DOWN IN EASTERN SXNS. LEFT ISOLD TSTMS IN FOR THE EVENING TO
COVER ANY AFTN DEVELOPMENT THAT LINGERS INTO THE EVENING.

ON TUE THE WEAK SFC FRONT WL LINGER ACRS THE AREA. PREFER THE NAM
HERE SINCE THE GFS SEEMS A LITTLE TOO AGGRESSIVE PUSHING THE FRONT
THROUGH. SHOULD BE A GOOD DEAL OF CLOUDINESS AND NO REAL TRIGGERS ON
TUE SO WL GO WITH A DRY FORECAST NORTH OF MEM AND A SLIGHT CHC TO
THE SOUTH ALONG THE FRONT. LOOKS LIKE AN OVERRUNNING SITUATION ON
TUE NIGHT AS A SHORTWAVE RACES ACRS THE MID MS VALLEY WITH 115 JET
SOMEWHERE ACRS THE REGION. GFS TENDS TO SUPPRESS PRECIP ALONG THE
GULF COAST WHILE THE NAM PUSHES IT FURTHER NORTH. ATTM THINK THE
CURRENT 40 POPS ARE FINE.

ON MONDAY...THIS AREA OF RAIN WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST THROUGHOUT

MOVING INTO AREAS ALONG AND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY 
AFTERNOON. THE SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL BE ENTERING NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS DURING THE AFTERNOON AS WELL. IF THE CLOUDS BREAK UP SOME 
THEN THERE IS A CHANCE FOR A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ALONG AND WEST OF THE 
RIVER DURING THE AFTERNOON. ALTHOUGH SEVERE PARAMETERS LOOK PRETTY 
WEAK...SOME SMALL HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS COULD BE POSSIBLE DUE TO THE 
LOW WET BULB ZERO LEVELS AROUND 7-8KFT. EXPECT CLOUDS AND RAIN TO 
HOLD DOWN THE TEMPS TOMORROW EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. SHOWER

COMPLETELY OUT OF THE REGION. 

ON TUESDAY...UPPER SHORTRIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA WITH ONLY RAIN 
CHANCES ALONG THE FRONT AND MODELS INDICATE THAT SUBSIDENCE FROM THE

THERE IS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE TEXAS PANHANDLE TODAY. THIS 
SYSTEM IS MOVING TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST AND IS WEAKENING. A SECONDARY 
SYSTEM TRAILS IT IN NEW MEXICO. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AND ASSOCIATED 
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM HAS MOVED INTO THE APPALACHIAN REGION. THERE 
HAS BEEN A GOOD DEAL OF LOW LEVEL DRY AIR IN PLACE OVER THE AREA 
TODAY AS A RESULT OF THE PROXIMITY TO THE HIGH. MUCH OF THE RADAR 
ECHOS HAVE BEEN VIRGA FALLING OUT OF MID LEVEL CLOUDS. PERHAPS THERE 
HAS BEEN SOME VERY LIGHT RAIN SCATTERED ABOUT NORTHEAST ARKANSAS 
WHERE LOWER ATMOSPHERE IS BEGINNING TO MOISTEN UP. THE SHOWER 
ACTIVITY OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS IS A COMBINATION OF THE UPPER 
JET...UPPER SHORTWAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND 
LOW LEVEL JET. 

THE UPPER RIDGE WILL MOVE SLOWLY EASTWARD TONIGHT. THE JET DYNAMICS 
WILL SHIFT EASTWARD AS WELL. THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER OKLAHOMA 
WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO BE REPLACED BY THE TRAILING 
SYSTEM. THE END RESULT WILL BE A MOISTENING OF THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE 
AND RAIN BECOMING HIGHLY LIKELY...ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT...FOR THE 
COUNTIES ALONG AND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. RAIN CHANCES EAST 
OF THIS AREA WILL BE LARGELY DUE TO UNCERTAINTY OF EASTWARD 
PROGRESSION OF THE RAIN. ON MONDAY...THIS AREA OF RAIN WILL CONTINUE

CLOUDS INCREASING TODAY SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND 
SFC LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER OK BY 00Z MON. EXPECT RAIN TO START 
TO THREATEN LATER TODAY WEST OF THE RIVER AS THE DRY LOWER LEVELS OF 
THE ATMOSPHERE TAKE A WHILE TO SATURATE. ALL IN ALL SHOULD BE A 
FAIRLY DECENT DAY WITH TEMPS AROUND 60...EXCEPT A LITTLE COOLER ACRS 
NE AR WHERE RAIN AND CLOUDS ARE MOST LIKELY. 

SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO SW MO/NW AR BY 12Z MON WITH SFC LOW OVER CNTRL 
MO. AXIS OF STRONG LIFT AND DEEP MOISTURE WL STRETCH FROM SRN IL 
SOUTHWARD ALONG THE MS RIVER AT 12Z MON. WL GO WITH CATEGORICAL 
POPS WEST OF THE RIVER DROPPING TO CHC ACRS NE MS. THIS AXIS OF LIFT 
AND MOISTURE WL MOVE ACRS THE MID SOUTH ON MON...SO EXPECT HIGH 
POPS. ATTM INSTABILITY LOOKS MARGINAL AT BEST SO WL CONT THE NO 
THUNDER FORECAST. RAIN WL SHUT OFF FROM WEST TO EAST MON AFTN AS DRY 
AIR PUNCHES IN FROM THE SW. SHOULD SEE TEMPS REBOUND NICELY ACRS WRN 
SXNS OF THE MID SOUTH DURING THE AFTN.

MON NIGHT AND TUE...TRAILING COLD FRONT STALLS SOMEWHERE...PROBABLY 
ACRS NRN OR CNTRL MS. WL CONT A SMALL POPS ACRS NE MS...NO PRECIP 
WITH MILD TEMPS ACRS REMAINDER OF THE AREA.

TUE NIGHT AND WED...A DECENT SHORTWAVE FORECAST TO MOVE OUT OF THE 
NRN PLAINS. NAM IS A LITTLE MORE STRONGER WITH UPPER SYSTEM AND 
DEVELOPS A SFC LOW ALONG THE BOUNDARY ACRS THE REGION. MEANWHILE THE 
GFS IS WEAKER WITH NOT MUCH OF A SFC SYSTEM. BEST BET IS TO CONT 
SMALL POPS TUE NIGHT/WED. 

HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS FROM WED NIGHT THROUGH SAT WITH SEASONABLE 
TEMPS. NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES THIS WEEKEND WITH RAIN POSSIBLE BY

919 PM CST SAT FEB 5 2005

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS WITH THE MID SOUTH IN A LIGHT SOUTHEAST 
RETURN FLOW REGIME. INFRARED SHOWS ALTOCUMULUS/CIRRUS DECK 
OVERSPREADING MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING ASSOCIATED WITH 
A DIGGING TROUGH ENTERING THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. AS A RESULT THE 
SUBTROPICAL JET HAS AMPLIFIED ACROSS THE REGION BRINGING A RETURN OF 
MOISTURE BACK TO THE AREA. CURRENT TEMPERATURES ARE MAINLY IN THE 
LOWER 40S NORTH TO THE LOWER 50S SOUTH. A WEAK UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE 
WILL MOVE ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS/MISSOURI OVERNIGHT BUT WILL NOT 
RESULT IN ANY PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.  00Z MODEL 
RUNS SHOW ISENTROPIC ASCENT BEGINNING TO INCREASE BY SUNDAY MORNING. 
BUT ANY RAINFALL WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH WITH QUITE A BIT OF LOW LEVEL DRY AIR IN PLACE FOR THE 
ATMOSPHERE TO OVERCOME. WILL MAKE MINOR TWEAKS TO FORECAST BASED 
UPON CURRENT TRENDS.

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE OUT SHORTLY

CJC

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 246 PM CST SAT FEB 5 2005.

ON SUNDAY...MODELS SHOW THAT THE LOW WILL WEAKEN AS IT LIFTS OUT AND 
RUNS INTO THE RIDGE. ALSO...THE LOW WILL LIKELY STAY FAR ENOUGH 
NORTHWEST DUE TO THE SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE RIDGE THAT 
MOST OF THE REGION WILL REMAIN DRY. THE LONE EXCEPTION WILL LIKELY 
BE NORTHWEST OF JONESBORO WHERE RAIN MAY MAKE IT IN DURING THE 
AFTERNOON. GFS BRINGS A GOOD DEAL SATURATES THE MID LEVELS DURING 
THE AFTERNOON...HENCE THE LOWER CHANCE POPS EAST OF THE JONESBORO 
AREA. WITH CLOUDS AROUND DURING A GOOD PORTION OF THE 
DAY...ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERNOON HAVE FORECASTED HIGHS TO BE 
SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE. THE BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL BE SUNDAY 
NIGHT AND MONDAY AS THE SECONDARY VORT MAX CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA BEGINS TO ARRIVE. BY THIS TIME THE RIDGE WILL HAVE MOVED 
FAR ENOUGH EAST THAT THE COMBINATION OF THE WEAK SHORTWAVE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE VORT...GOOD JET DYNAMICS AND LOW LEVEL JET 
BRINGING WARM MOIST AIR INTO THE REGION WILL RESULT IN HIGH CHANCES 
OF RAIN WEST OF A LINE FROM ROUGHLY JACKSON TO OXFORD. FURTHER 
EAST...INFLUENCE OF THE RIDGE WILL HINDER RAIN CHANCES. MID LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES...LIS AND CAPE DURING THIS TIME LOOKS TOO STABLE FOR ANY 
MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS. 

ON MONDAY...THE UPPER SHORTWAVE AND UPPER JET WILL MOVE OVER THE 
REGION RESULTING IN HIGH CHANCES FOR RAIN. THE EUROPEAN MODEL IS IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE GFS IN TERMS OF TIMING OF THE SYSTEM ON 
MONDAY. THIS WOULD TAKE MOST OF THE MORE SIGNIFICANT RAIN EAST OF 
THE REGION BY 00Z WITH AREAS ALONG AND WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
PERHAPS EVEN SEEING SOME AFTERNOON SUNSHINE. THE NAM...FORMERLY THE 
ETA...IS MUCH SLOWER WITH THE PROGRESSION. NAM LOOKS LIKE IT 
CONTINUES THE CONVECTION OVER LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI DURING THE 
AFTERNOON IN RESPONSE TO WHAT IS A WEAKENING UPPER JET BY THAT TIME. 
GIVEN THE GOOD CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND THE GFS...FAVOR THAT 
SOLUTION. FAVOR MAV GUIDANCE FOR JONESBORO WITH AFTERNOON SUN AND 
LOWER CHANCES FOR RAIN. WENT COOLER THAN GUIDANCE EAST OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER DUE TO CLOUDINESS/RAIN CHANCES LINGERING INTO THE 
AFTERNOON. 

ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL HAVE 
STALLED FROM NORTHWEST MS INTO LOUISIANA. GFS SUGGESTS CHANCES FOR 
RAIN ALONG THE FRONT DUE TO CONTINUED INTERACTION WITH THE 
SUBTROPICAL JET. GFS INSTABILITY DOES SHOW EXTREMELY LOW 
CAPE...PERHAPS A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE FRONT BUT 
NOTHING SEVERE.

ON TUESDAY NIGHT...THE GFS NOW BRINGS ANOTHER VORT MAX AND 
ASSOCIATED SHORTWAVE THROUGH PROVIDING ANOTHER SHOT AT RAIN. TODAYS 
RUN IS FASTER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS SO LEFT A SLIGHT CHANCE IN ON 
WEDNESDAY DUE TO TIMING CONCERNS. HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD BUILD INTO 
THE REGION AFTER WEDNESDAY RESULTING IN DRY CONDITIONS AND COOLER 
TEMPERATURES.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS ALONG THE APPALACHIAN RANGE. THIS IS 
BRINGING A SOUTHEAST WIND INTO THE AREA. A CUT OFF LOW IS OVER 
THE BAJA CALIFORNIA REGION WHICH HAS AMPLIFIED THE RIDGE THAT IS 
OVER THE SOUTHCENTRAL US. THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THIS LOW HAS ALSO 
FORCED THE SUBTROPICAL JET NORTHWARD FROM TEXAS AND OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH. A SECONDARY VORT MAX IS ALONG THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA 
COAST. 

THE CUT OFF LOW WILL BEGIN TO LIFT OUT TOWARDS THE NORTHNORTHEAST 
TONIGHT. AS IT DOES SO...MID TO HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE SYSTEM WILL TRAVEL ALONG THE JET AND OVER THE REGION TONIGHT. 
WITH THE SURFACE HIGH MOVING OFF TO THE EAST...SHOULD MAINTAIN A 
LIGHT WIND TONIGHT. COMBINED WITH INCREASING CLOUD COVER...THIS 
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO KEEP MIN TEMPS UP.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY. THIS IS 
BRINGING A EASTSOUTEAST WIND INTO THE AREA. A CUT OFF LOW IS OVER 
THE BAJA CALIFORNIA REGION WHICH HAS AMPLIFIED THE RIDGE THAT IS 
OVER THE SOUTHCENTRAL US. THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THIS LOW HAS ALSO 
FORCED THE SUBTROPICAL JET NORTHWARD FROM TEXAS AND OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH. THE HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL 
MOISTURE AS SEEN ON THE NORTH AMERICA WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH...THE CLOUDS HAVE BEEN ENHANCED INTO A NARROW BUT MUCH MORE 
DENSE DECK DUE TO THE INTERACTION WITH THE UPPER JET. SATELLITE 
TRENDS SHOW THIS DECK HAS BEEN THINNING...SO EXPECT THAT BY THIS 
AFTERNOON THE SUN WILL BE TRANSPARENT THROUGH THE CIRRUS ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE REGION. WITH SOME SUN...HIGHS SHOULD STILL AT LEAST APPROACH 
THOSE CURRENTLY FORECASTED. ONLY UPDATE TO THE FORECAST WAS TO THE

UPPER RIDGE CENTERED FROM THE LOWER GREAT LAKES THROUGH THE LOWER MS 
VALLEY THIS MORNING. HIGH CLOUDS STREAMING ACROSS THE RIDGE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA HELPING TO KEEP TEMPS FROM BOTTOMING OUT. PATCHY FOG 
LIMITED SO FAR THIS MORNING. SFC AND UPPER RIDGE TO SHIFT EAST 
TODAY. A NICE DAY ON TAP WITH A MIX OF MID/HIGH CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE. 
850 MB TEMPS OF +8C WILL YIELD SFC TEMPS FROM 58-61 DEGREES. 

EXPECT INCREASING MID AND HIGH CLOUDS TONIGHT AND WARMER TEMPS AS 
RIDGE CONTINUES RETREAT TO THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD. TEMPS WL PROBABLY 
STAY ABOVE 40 MOST PLACES EXPECT ALONG THE TN RIVER AND ACRS NE MS. 

NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES ON SUNDAY. DECENT SHORTWAVE STARTS TO MOVE 
INTO THE SRN PLAINS WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND LIFT MOVING INTO

PRESSURE DEVELOPING ACRS SRN MO. GOOD MOISTURE ADVECTION ACRS AR 
WITH SFC DEWPOINTS CLIMBING INTO THE MID 50S AS FAR N AS JBR BY 12Z 
MON. ETA AND GFS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ATTM WITH PRECIP AREA AND WL GO 
LIKELY POPS WEST OF THE RIVER AND THEN EAST OF THE RIVER ON MON. 

PRECIP WL TAPER OFF LATE MONDAY AS A WEAK SFC FRONT MOVES THROUGH 
STALLING JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA ON TUE MORNING. TUESDAY LOOKS LIKE 
AN IN BETWEEN SYSTEMS DAY WITH PERHAPS SOME PRECIP ALONG THE STALLED 
FROM TO THE SOUTH AND MORE ACTIVITY TO THE NW OF THE MID SOUTH AS 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE APPROACHES. TUE NIGHT INTO WED THE SHORTWAVE MOVES 
ACRS THE AREA WITH ASSOCD SFC LOW PRESSURE ORGANIZING OVER THE MS

ANOTHER WARM DAY FOR SATURDAY WITH THE UPPER RIDGE IN CONTROL AND

WHICH SUPPORTS TEMPS AROUND 60. THERE MAY BE A FEW MORE HIGH CLOUDS 
THAN TODAY RESULTING IN MORE OF A PARTLY SUNNY SKY. CLOUDS WILL BE

SUNDAY NIGHT. THESE CHANCES WILL BE DUE TO FORCING BY THE LOW LEVEL 
JET THAN ANYTHING. ON MONDAY THE JET WILL MOVE OFF TO THE EAST AND A 
WAVE MOVING ALONG THE FRONT WILL PASS TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA. THIS

SURFACE MAP PLACES AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION WITH

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM TEXAS THROUGH WESTERN MISSOURI 
THIS AFTERNOON. THIS FEATURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
THAT IS BUILDING INTO THE REGION. SATELLITE SHOWS CLOUDS CLEARING 
FROM THE NORTH WITH THE CLEARING LINE MOVING SOUTHWARD. AN 
EXTRAPOLATION OF THE CLEARING LINE WOULD PLACE IT NEAR THE TN/MS 
BORDER BY 00Z...SOUTH OF OXFORD/TUPELO BY 03Z WITH CLEAR SKIES 
AREAWIDE BY MIDNIGHT. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY THE 18Z MESOETA MOISTURE 
FIELDS. THE NORTHERLY WINDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO ADVECT DRIER AIR IN 
AT THE SURFACE. ONCE SKIES CLEAR...WINDS SHOULD GO LIGHT AND ALLOW 
MIN TEMPS TO FALL TO AROUND THE FREEZING POINT BY MORNING. 

UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL FOR 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. MOISTURE PROFILES INDICATE MAINLY CLEAR SKIES 
INTO SATURDAY. 850 TEMPS WARM UP TO AROUND +6 ON FRIDAY AND +8 ON 
SATURDAY. GUIDANCE TEMPS INTO SATURDAY LOOK REASONABLE. 

A CUT OFF LOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN US WILL EJECT OUT AND BEGIN TO 
IMPACT THE AREA ON SUNDAY. GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
TIMING OF THE SYSTEM INTO THE AREA DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY WHILE 
ETA IS SLOWER...MORE SUNDAY NIGHT. THE SYSTEM WILL BE WEAKENING AS 
IT LIFTS OUT AND RUNS INTO A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED RIDGE OVER THE EAST 
COAST. THE SYSTEM WILL SLOW DOWN OVER THE REGION AND THE SURFACE 
FRONT WILL STAY MAINLY NORTH OF THE REGION INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS 
A RESULT...THE BETTER RAIN CHANCES WILL BE SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT AS 
THE INITIAL SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES OVERHEAD. 700-500MB LAPSE 
RATES...LIS AND CAPES ALL ARE TOO STABLE FOR THUNDERSTORMS 
THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST. AREAWIDE...THE BETTER CHANCES OF RAIN WILL 
BE TOWARDS THE NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND CLOSER TO WHERE 
THE UPPER LOW WILL TRACK AS IT MOVES ACROSS MISSOURI. AFTER 
MONDAY...THERE IS HIGH UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST. BOTH ECMWF AND 
GFS COMING OUT WITH SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS ALMOST EVERY RUN. 
GENERALLY SPEAKING...IT LOOKS LIKE THE REGION WILL REMAIN WARM AND 
THERE MAY BE ENOUGH MOISTURE TO SUPPORT A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS THROUGH 
MIDWEEK. THE GFS AND ECMWF BOTH AGREE THAT A VORT MAX WILL DROP DOWN 
THE WEST COAST ON MONDAY AND WORK ITS WAY EASTWARD TO PUSH THE FRONT 
THROUGH AROUND WEDNESDAY WITH DRIER WEATHER EXPECTED TOWARDS END OF 
NEXT WEEK.

SURFACE MAP SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING FROM TEXAS INTO 
WESTERN MISSOURI. SATELLITE SHOWS LOW CLOUDS ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
REGION THIS MORNING. MESOETA MOISTURE PROFILES AGREE WITH SATELLITE 
TRENDS THAT DRIER AIR SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI WILL BEGIN TO WORK INTO 
THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING. CURRENT FORECAST 
HANDLES THE SKY COVER WELL. AM A LITTLE CONCERNED ABOUT EXPECTED 
HIGHS FOR TODAY AND MAX TEMPS MAY NEED TO BE LOWERED A COUPLE OF 
DEGREES. BUT WILL MONITOR SATELLITE TRENDS AND TEMPS THROUGH 1630Z 
BEFORE MAKING A FINAL DECISION.

THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE AN END IN SIGHT TO THE CLOUD COVER WHICH
SEEMS TO HAVE COVERED THE REGION FOR SEVERAL DAYS. CLEARING LINE
EXTENDS FROM EASTERN OKLAHOMA INTO SOUTHERN MISSOURI AND CENTRAL
ILLINOIS. HOWEVER...THIS LINE WILL BE PROGRESSING SLOWLY THROUGH THE
REGION SO IT WONT BE UNTIL THIS EVENING THAT WE WILL SEE
SIGNIFICANT BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS. BY LATE TONIGHT...SKIES SHOULD
HAVE CLEARED AND TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TOWARD FREEZING. FRIDAY
SHOULD BE WARMER AS SKIES REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY. THE NEXT STORM
SYSTEM BEGIN TO APPROACH THE REGION BY SUNDAY. HAVE INCLUDED SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS IN THE 12-18Z PERIOD ON SUNDAY TO BETTER CONFORM WITH
NEIGHBORING OFFICES. AS WAS THE CASE YESTERDAY...MODELS STILL HOLD
OFF BRINGING COLD FRONT THROUGH FORECAST AREA UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT OR
WEDNESDAY MORNING SO HAD TO TWEAK TEMPERATURES A LITTLE UPWARD FOR

SURFACE MAP THIS AFTERNOON PLACES THE CENTER OF LOW PRESSURE OFF THE

CLOUDS TO THE SOUTH AND MORE SUN TO THE NORTH...THE RESULT SHOULD BE 
A FAIRLY UNIFORM MAX TEMP DISTRIBUTION ACROSS THE REGION OF MID TO 
UPPER 40S. ANY CLOUDS LEFT SOUTH AND EAST OF THE TUPELO AREA SHOULD 
EXIT THE REGION DURING THE EVENING LEAVING MAINLY CLEAR SKIES 
REGIONWIDE. WINDS WILL BE FAIRLY LIGHT WHICH WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES 
TO FALL TO AROUND THE DEW POINTS WHICH SHOULD BE NEAR OR JUST BELOW 
FREEZING.

FRIDAY...UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA AND SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL MOVE OVERHEAD. THE RESULT...SUNSHINE AT LAST. 
NOTICEABLY WARMER TOO WITH 850 TEMPS BEING ADVECTED IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWESTERN US OF AROUND +6 SUPPORTING TEMPS IN THE MID 50S FOR 
HIGHS. GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING NIGHT ONCE AGAIN ON FRIDAY NIGHT 
WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVERHEAD...WINDS SHOULD GO CALM. UNDERCUTTED MOS

THE RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL INTO SATURDAY RESULTING IN MORE

SURFACE MAP THIS AFTERNOON PLACES THE CENTER OF LOW PRESSURE OFF THE

A DRY SLOT OVER THE MIDSOUTH WITH ALL OF THE SIGNIFICANT 
PRECIPITATION ALONG THE PERIPHERY OF THE DRY SLOT AND CIRCULATING 
AROUND AN 850MB LOW. TEMPERATURES TODAY HAVE REMAINED NEARLY STEADY

.DISCUSSION...NO BIG CHANGES FROM EARLIER. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR THE 
EASTERN COUNTIES MORE CLOSELY THAN ANY OTHER PART OF THE CWA AS 
DEWPOINTS ARE MUCH LOWER IN MDL TN AND NRN AL WITH A STIFF ERLY WIND.
WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST SOON WITH VERY MINOR TWEEKS AT THIS TIME.

&&

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...LATEST 88D RADAR RETURNS SHOW RAIN SLOWLY 
PROGRESSING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SURFACE TEMPERATURES THIS 
AFTERNOON HAVE WARMED INTO THE 40S TO LOWER 50S. HOWEVER SURFACE 
DEWPOINTS HAVE REMAINED NEARLY STEADY OR SLOWLY DROPPING INTO THE 
LOWER 20S ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE 
DRIER AIR FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN ALABAMA HAS TRIED TO 
ADVECT IN. RAIN WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
AS 305K ISENTROPIC SURFACE SHOWS DECENT ISENTROPIC ASCENT ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...MOISTURE WILL 
TEMPORARILY BEGIN TO DIMINISH OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE AREA BEFORE RETURNING BY MID/LATE MORNING ON 
SATURDAY. MESOETA/RUC SOUNDINGS SHOW A RATHER PRONOUNCED WARM NOSE 
AT 850 MB /+3/ AND A RELATIVELY SHALLOW COLD LAYER AROUND 1500 FT. 
IF TEMPERATURES COOL DOWN TO WET BULB TEMPERATURES...FREEZING RAIN 
WOULD BE THE LIKELY PRECIPITATION TYPE ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. THINK MOST IF NOT ALL AREAS WILL REMAIN ABOVE 
FREEZING...AND WOULD EXPECT PRECIPITATION TO FALL MAINLY AS RAIN. AS 
A RESULT...WILL MENTION RAIN OR SNOW IN THE FORECAST FOR THE 
AFFECTED AREA. EVENING SHIFT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR LATEST TRENDS 
IN THE EVENT PREICPITATION TYPE BECOMES AN INCREASING CONCERN. 

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE IN THE FLOW WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY ON SATURDAY...BRINGING 
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RAIN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. ASSOCIATED MOISTURE 
WILL BECOME MORE LIMITED BY SATURDAY NIGHT AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING 
TRIES TO BUILD IN ACROSS THE AREA. LOWERED POPS FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY AS LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE INDICATING A SLIGHTLY DRIER PATTERN. 
HOWEVER I DECIDED NOT TO PULL POPS COMPLETELY SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS

TWO.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...CONFIDENCE VERY LOW IN THE 
EXTENDED FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE AS LONG TERM MODELS RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY EVEN WORSE TODAY...WHICH MEANS ANOTHER PATTERN CHANGE IS

WEAK INVERTED TROF FROM SRN LA TO NEAR CSV. SKIES CLOUDY ACROSS THE
ENTIRE AREA...WITH TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM UPPER 20S EXTREME
NORTH TO AROUND 40 NEAR TUPELO. DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE TEENS IN MOST
AREAS. IT APPEARS THAT ANY PRECIPITATION REACHING THE SURFACE IS
OCCURRING TO THE SOUTH OF OUR CWA.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...
AS SYSTEM TO OUR SOUTHWEST BEGINS TO KICK OUT...ISENTROPIC LIFT
BECOMES A BIGGER PLAYER IN OUR WEATHER. MOST PRECIPITATION CURRENTLY
OVER LOUISIANA AND SRN MS. BEST LIFT FOR OUR AREA IS LATE THIS
AFTERNOON THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. POPS WILL GRADUALLY
INCREASE TO LIKELY ACROSS SOUTHWEST THIRD THIS AFTERNOON...CHANCE
ELSEWHERE. LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS AREAWIDE TONIGHT...AND LIKELY
ON SATURDAY. MOST SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION WILL BE TO OUR SOUTH...
BUT EXPECT MOST EVERYONE TO MEASURE. ANOTHER SHOT OF PRECIPITATION
SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.

PRECIPITATION TYPE WAS LOOKED AT RATHER CLOSELY. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN THE
LIQUID FORM FOR THIS FORECAST. MAY BE A BRIEF EXCEPTION TO THAT ALONG
THE NORTHERN BORDER OF THE CWA LATE TONIGHT. IF NEW MODEL SOLUTIONS
COME IN COLDER...THE DAY SHIFT MAY HAVE TO BECOME A LITTLE MORE
PESSIMISTIC WITH TONIGHTS FORECAST. FOR MOST AREAS...SNOW NOT AN
OPTION...WOULD BE RAIN...FREEZING RAIN...OR SLEET. ANY PRECIPITATION
SUNDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT WILL BE ALL RAIN.

NOT A BIG DIURNAL SPREAD ON TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
PROBABLY LESS THAN 10 DEGREES. EXPECTING ALL AREAS TO REMAIN ABOVE
FREEZING...IF ONLY SLIGHTLY SO.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER SUNDAY)...
NOT PLANNING SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO EXTENDED FORECAST. 00Z/28 GFS

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS CENTERS HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
MICHIGAN AND SOUTHERN ONTARIO. VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS MOSTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. DIURNAL CUMULUS WHICH FORMED THIS 
MORNING HAS DISSIPATED WITH NORTHEASTERLY WINDS BRINGING LOWER 
DEWPOINT AIR INTO THE NORTHEAST THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. WATER 
VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS NEXT WAVE TO BEGIN TO AFFECT THE MID SOUTH ON 
FRIDAY OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S./SOUTHERN PLAINS. MAIN FORECAST 
CONCERNS WILL BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...AND 
WINTER PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL FRIDAY NIGHT. ETA/GFS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT THROUGH FIRST 36 HOURS BUT BEGIN TO DIVERGE AFTER THAT.

TONIGHT...CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AGAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST 
THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA AS NEXT SYSTEM MOVES CLOSER. ALTHOUGH 
DEWPOINTS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE 20S...I EXPECT LOWS RANGING FROM 
AROUND 30 INTO THE LOWER 30S WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY/CLOUDY SKIES.

FRIDAY...UPPER LEVEL WAVE WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE MID SOUTH DURING 
THE DAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL NOT BE MUCH DIFFERENT FROM TODAY 
/40S/ AS MOISTURE DEEPENS THROUGH THE DAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST 
ONSET OF RAIN WILL NOT OCCUR UNTIL AFTERNOON AS 700-500 MID LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES INCREASE TO AROUND 6 C/KM BY 00Z SATURDAY AND SOME LOW 
LEVEL DRY AIR WILL NEED TO BE OVERCOME BEFORE ANY PRECIPITATION 
REACHES THE SURFACE.  

FRIDAY NIGHT...PRECIPITATION TYPE BEGINS TO GET TRICKY ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN TIER OF THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. ETA SOUNDINGS SHOW 
A PRONOUNCED WARM NOSE IN THE 900-850 MB LAYER WITH TEMPERATURES 
DROPPING OVERNIGHT INTO THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 30S. THE GFS THOUGH IS 
NOT AS PRONOUNCED WITH ELEVATED WARM LAYER AND WARMS THROUGH THE 
NIGHT. ALSO BOTH THE ETA/GFS SHOW SOME MID LEVEL DRY AIR TEMPORARILY 
WORKING IN ACROSS THE AREA...WHICH WILL GREATLY DIMINISH ICE NUCLEI 
ACTIVATION AND THUS WOULD EXPECT DRIZZLE AT BEST. THINK TEMPERATURES 
WILL STAY ABOVE FREEZING ACROSS MOST AREAS BUT WILL MENTION CHANCE 
OF DRIZZLE OR FREEZING DRIZZLE ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES. 
LATER SHIFTS WILL TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT SITUATION FOR FROZEN 
PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL FRIDAY NIGHT.

SATURDAY...MODEL DIFFERENCES BECOME MORE APPARENT BY SATURDAY. GFS 
PREFERS TO BRING UPPER LEVEL LOW ACROSS THE MID SOUTH...WHILE THE 
ETA SUGGESTS MORE OF A NORTHERLY TRACK ACROSS CENTRAL/EAST CENTRAL 
MISSOURI. NONETHELESS...WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS FOR RAIN ACROSS THE AREA 
AS NEGATIVELY TILTED UPPER LEVEL TROF SWINGS THROUGH ON SATURDAY. 

SUNDAY...RAINFALL MAY BRIEFLY COME TO AN END SUNDAY MORNING AS UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGING TRIES TO BUILD INTO THE MID SOUTH AS THE REGION 
REMAINS IN A SOUTHWEST FLOW REGIME. THE NEXT SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE 
THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS AND RAISED POPS TO LIKELY 
FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. 

LONG RANGE...(MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...REGION IS EXPECTED TO DRY 
OUT BY TUESDAY AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES OFF TO THE ATLANTIC COAST. RUN 
TO RUN CONTINUITY BETWEEN THE LONG RANGE MODELS HAVE BEEN POOR BUT 
SUGGEST THAT THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES WILL REMAIN IN A 
NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME WITH THE MID SOUTH REMAINING DRY THROUGH THE 
END OF THE PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...
A COLD FRONT HAS SETTLED ALONG THE GULF COAST THIS MORNING AND AN 
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION. 
SATELLITE SHOWS CLOUDY SKIES BEGINNING TO BREAK UP DURING THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH DRIER AIR MOVING IN FROM THE NORTHEAST. THERE 
IS A STORM SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN MOUNTAIN WEST REGION AND THIS 
WILL BE THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER FOR THE MIDSOUTH.

EXPECT THE DAY TO START OUT WITH SOME SUN. THIS MAY BE THE LAST THAT 
THE AREA SEES SUN FOR A WHILE...BECAUSE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS CURRENTLY OVER OKLAHOMA/TEXAS WILL 
OVERTAKE THE AREA BY AFTERNOON. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO THE 
TEMP/WX FORECAST FOR TODAY. LATE TONIGHT...AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE 
WILL BEGIN TO APPROACH THE REGION. CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN IN 
TACT AHEAD OF THE SHORTWAVE. HOWEVER WITH NO LIFTING MECHANISMS AND 
DRY AIR IN THE LOWER LEVELS...DRY FORECAST WILL CONTINUE. 

ON FRIDAY...THE UPPER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE OVER THE REGION. THE 
SURFACE FRONT ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL BEGIN TO SLOWLY ADVANCE 
NORTHWARD. SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE MID TO LOW LEVELS WILL BE 
SATURATED ENOUGH FOR PRECIPITATION TO BREAK OUT ACROSS EASTERN 
ARKANSAS...EXTREME WEST TN AND NORTHWEST MS. DEPENDING UPON THE 
TIMING..PRECIP MAY BE AREAWIDE BY 00Z. REDUCED TEMPS DUE TO CLOUD 
COVER...ANTICIPATED PRECIPITATION AND WARM AIR ADVECTION NOT AS 
AGGRESSIVE AS PREVIOUSLY INDICATED. 

BY FRIDAY NIGHT...BOTH GFS AND ETA SOUNDINGS SHOW THE LOWER AND MID 
LEVELS VERY WELL SATURATED TO SUPPORT LIGHT PRECIPITATION. BOTH 
MODELS SHOW THE SURFACE LAYER NEAR THE FREEZING MARK OVER A GOOD 
PORTION OF THE REGION WITH THE GFS BEING SLIGHTLY COOLER. THERE IS A 
POSSIBILITY OF AT LEAST A BRIEF PERIOD OF SOME LIGHT FREEZING RAIN 
OR SLEET. HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE THIS FAR OUT IS RATHER LOW AND WILL 
NOT MENTION IN EITHER HWO OR FORECAST. STILL...LATER SHIFTS MAY WANT 
TO REEVALUATE THE SITUATION. 

ON SATURDAY...THE UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO MOVE AWAY FROM 
THE REGION AND THE SURFACE WARM FRONT WILL BE AT LEAST NEAR THE 
REGION IF NOT INTO THE AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL SUGGEST THAT THE 
LOW LEVELS WILL BE SATURATED SO EXPECT LIGHT RAIN TO LINGER INTO 
SATURDAY...AT LEAST. 

BY SUNDAY...A SECOND UPPER LOW WILL BE ENTERING THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
AND ANOTHER SHORTWAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM WILL BE APPROACHING 
THE AREA. THE GFS TRIES TO DRY OUT THE LOWER LEVELS OUT SOMEWHAT 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. HOWEVER...THE ETA CONTINUE TO SHOW A 
VERY SATURATED SOUNDING THROUGH SUNDAY. IN EITHER CASE...STILL 
CLOUDY. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE FRONT WILL BE JUST SOUTH OF THE 
AREA...SO HAVE LOWERED TEMPS THAT INDICATED THE AREA WOULD BE IN THE 
WARM SECTOR. 

ON MONDAY...THE UPPER SYSTEM AND SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND 
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. PRECIP CHANCES WILL 
CONTINUE INTO MONDAY...BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THINGS MAY FINALLY DRY OUT 
BEHIND THE SYSTEM.

.UPDATE...
COOLER AIR AND LOTS OF LOW CLOUDS MOVING INTO THE AREA BEHIND COLD 
FRONT ALONG WITH GUSTY NORTHERLY SFC WINDS. UPDATED GRIDS AND ZONES 
TO REFLECT CURRENT TEMPS AND CLOUD TRENDS.  

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 200 AM...
SHORTWAVE CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH THE CWA HAS PRODUCED SOME 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES ON RADAR. DON/T KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS IS 
ACTUALLY REACHING THE GROUND DUE TO FEW SFC OBS REPORTING PRECIP. 
SHORTWAVE WILL PUSH EAST OF AREA BY 12Z...SO WILL GO WITH DRY 
FORECAST TODAY. SOME MID CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTWAVE SHOULD 
ALSO PUSH EAST BY MID MORNING.

A DRY COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA TODAY. COOLER AIR WILL 
FILTER INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE FRONT. IN ADDITION...EXPECT LOW 
CLOUDS BEHIND THE FRONT...CURRENTLY ACROSS IOWA...TO MOVE INTO 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH BY THIS AFTERNOON. WILL GO WITH 
BECOMING MOSTLY CLOUDY WORDING IN ZONES ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS 
WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SOUTH.

LOW CLOUDS WILL STICK AROUND CWA TONIGHT BUT SHOULD MOVE OUT OF AREA 
BY THURSDAY MORNING AS COOL HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE MIDSOUTH. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BACK TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL ON THURSDAY. 

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AGAIN THURSDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING SHORTWAVE. EXPECT PRECIPITATION TO BEGIN TO OCCUR ACROSS 
THE SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF CWA SOMETIME FRIDAY. BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT...SHORTWAVE WILL BE MOVING OVER CWA AND SPREADING RAIN ACROSS 
THE ENTIRE CWA. RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE INTO 
SATURDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHEAST HALF OF CWA.

EXPECT A BREAK IN PRECIPITATION SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM MOVES OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST ON SUNDAY. RAIN CHANCES WILL BEGIN 
IN THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF THE MIDSOUTH ON SUNDAY AND WILL SPREAD 
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH BY SUNDAY NIGHT. RAIN 
CHANCES SHOULD BEGIN TO DIMINISH BY MONDAY NIGHT AS THE SYSTEM MOVES 
FAR ENOUGH EAST FROM THE CWA. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY BRINGING DRY 
CONDITIONS BACK TO THE MIDSOUTH.

SHORTWAVE WILL PUSH EAST OF AREA BY 12Z...SO WILL GO WITH DRY 
FORECAST TODAY. SOME MID CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTWAVE SHOULD ALSO 
PUSH EAST BY MID MORNING.

A DRY COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA TODAY. COOLER AIR WILL 
FILTER INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE FRONT. IN ADDITION...EXPECT LOW 
CLOUDS BEHIND THE FRONT...CURRENTLY ACROSS IOWA...TO MOVE INTO 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH BY THIS AFTERNOON. WILL GO WITH 
BECOMING MOSTLY CLOUDY WORDING IN ZONES ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS 
WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SOUTH.

LOW CLOUDS WILL STICK AROUND CWA TONIGHT BUT SHOULD MOVE OUT OF AREA 
BY THURSDAY MORNING AS COOL HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE MIDSOUTH. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BACK TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL ON THURSDAY. 

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AGAIN THURSDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING SHORTWAVE. EXPECT PRECIPITATION TO BEGIN TO OCCUR ACROSS 
THE SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF CWA SOMETIME FRIDAY. BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT...SHORTWAVE WILL BE MOVING OVER CWA AND SPREADING RAIN ACROSS 
THE ENTIRE CWA. RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE INTO 
SATURDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NORTHEAST HALF OF CWA.

EXPECT A BREAK IN PRECIPITATION SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM MOVES OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST ON SUNDAY. RAIN CHANCES WILL BEGIN 
IN THE SOUTHWESTERN PART OF THE MIDSOUTH ON SUNDAY AND WILL SPREAD 
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH BY SUNDAY NIGHT. RAIN 
CHANCES SHOULD BEGIN TO DIMINISH BY MONDAY NIGHT AS THE SYSTEM MOVES 
FAR ENOUGH EAST FROM THE CWA. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY BRINGING DRY 
CONDITIONS BACK TO THE MIDSOUTH.

WARM SPELL WILL CONTINUE TODAY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. IN FACT EXPECT 
TODAY TO BE WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. SOUTHWEST WINDS AND MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES WILL HELP TEMPERATURES REACH INTO THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S 
BY THIS AFTERNOON.

AN UPPER TROUGH WILL SWING THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT. NOT A LOT OF 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH. ONLY EXPECT AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS 
WITH IT.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE CWA ON WEDNESDAY. AGAIN WITH NO 
MOISTURE TO WORK WITH...NO PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED WITH THE 
PASSAGE OF THE FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL COOL DOWN BACK TO NEAR 
NORMAL BEHIND THE FRONT. COOL HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA 
FOR THURSDAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY BE IN THE 40S.

SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL TROUGHS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE CWA THIS WEEKEND.  
DRY CONDITIONS WILL COME TO AN END WITH THE PASSAGE OF THESE 
TROUGHS. THERE WILL BE ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR PRECIPITATION TO OCCUR. 
MODELS ARE QUITE A BIT DIFFERENT WITH TIMING ON THE FIRST TROUGH. 
ETA IS MUCH FASTER SPREADING RAIN INTO THE AREA FRIDAY MORNING AS 
THE TROUGH APPROACHES. HOWEVER THE GFS DOES NOT SPREAD RAIN INTO THE 
AREA UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING. CURRENT FORECAST HAS RAIN IN FORECAST FOR 
FRIDAY SO WILL LEAVE AS IS FOR NOW. RAIN CHANCES FROM THE TROUGHS 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEKEND. THERE WILL BE A SHORT 
BREAK ON SUNDAY BEFORE ANOTHER TROUGH BEGINS TO MOVE INTO THE AREA 
FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED ALONG THE GULF COAST THIS 
AFTERNOON. A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS EASTERN TX...AR...MS AND

SOUTH TODAY. 

MODELS HAVE BEEN TRYING TO BRING HIGHER DEW POINTS INTO THE FORECAST

SOUTHWEST AND WEST WHERE DEW POINTS WERE ONLY AS HIGH AS THE LOWER 
20S. THE MOISTURE WILL BE A LITTLE SLOWER TO ADVECT INTO THE MID 
SOUTH TONIGHT. 

THE CURRENT UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL GENERALLY HAVE A RIDGE IN THE 
WEST AND A TROUGH IN THE EAST THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THERE WILL BE A 
SHORTWAVE THAT WILL TRANSLATE OUT OF EASTERN NEW MEXICO THIS EVENING 
AND EVENTUALLY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TUESDAY EVENING. NOT EXPECTING 
MUCH IN THE WAY OF PRECIP WITH LIMITED MOISTURE...HOWEVER A FEW 
SPRINKLES MAY OCCUR. WILL KEEP AN EYE ON THE STRONGER SHORTWAVE 
SWINGING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL CAUSE 
ANOTHER COLD FRONT TO OOZE INTO THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY. THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH TOWARD THE GULF COAST WHILE THE

WILL BRING WINDS AROUND TO THE SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF THE NEXT STORM 
SYSTEM. THUS...EXPECTING ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO BE IN PLACE 
WHEN THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE AREA WHICH WILL INCREASE RAIN 
CHANCES.

THIS NEXT SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE FOR MORE RAIN TO OCCUR OVER SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA. THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN 
U.S. THURSDAY. RAIN CHANCES FOR THE MID SOUTH WILL INCREASE FRIDAY 
INTO SATURDAY. THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM IS STILL QUESTIONABLE.

HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED INTO THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. WINDS ARE CALM

ALLOWING WINDS TO SWITCH AROUND TO THE SOUTHWEST. THIS WILL BRING A 
WARM UP TO THE MIDSOUTH. EXPECT HIGHS TO GET INTO THE MID TO UPPER

NOT A LOT OF MOISTURE IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM. ANY PRECIP 
THAT DOES OCCUR WILL BE SOUTH OF THE CWA SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY

A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE CWA ON WEDNESDAY. AGAIN WITH 
NOT A LOT OF MOISTURE AROUND SO THE FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH DRY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY DROP TO NEAR NORMAL BEHIND THE FRONT.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY 
NIGHT. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ON FRIDAY AHEAD OF ANOTHER

HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL PATTERN IN PLACE ACROSS THE U.S. THIS
AFTERNOON...WITH A DEEP TROUGH OVER THE EAST AND RIDGE IN THE WEST.
THE PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO FLATTEN OUT AND BECOME MORE ZONAL BY MID
WEEK. BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND NEXT WEEKEND THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW
WILL BECOME SOUTHWESTERLY OVER THE AREA WITH A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES
MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW.

.TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...

A COLD SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE AREA TONIGHT WILL MOVE
TO OUR SOUTHEAST ON MONDAY AND CONTINUE MOVING EAST THROUGH MID
WEEK. AS THE HIGH SLIDES EAST...LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL RETURN BACK
OUT OF THE SOUTH AND EVENTUALLY SOUTHWEST BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. AS
WINDS VEER AROUND TO THE SOUTH...DECENT WARM ADVECTION WILL BEGIN
IN EARNEST LATER TONIGHT AND CONTINUE THROUGH MONDAY. SO ONE MORE
COLD NIGHT IS IN STORE WITH GOOD TEMPERATURE RECOVERY ON MONDAY...
WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES GETTING BACK TO THE MID 40S NORTHEAST TO LOW
50S ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO MODERATE
THROUGH TUESDAY WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH MID WEEK. HIGH
PRESSURE WILL KEEP WEATHER CONDITIONS DRY AS WELL THROUGH TUESDAY.

.TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...

THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME ZONAL OVER THE MID SOUTH FOR MID
WEEK. A CUT OFF LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. WILL
BEGIN TO LIFT OUT TO THE EAST AS A TROUGH DIGS INTO THE WESTERN
U.S. THIS UPPER LOW WILL WEAKEN INTO AN OPEN TROUGH AS IT MOVES EAST
AND TRIES TO PHASE WITH A NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE MOVING
SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES. AT THIS TIME...IT
APPEARS THAT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD OF THESE SYSTEMS WILL
BE LIMITED. THEREFORE AS THE NORTHERN STREAM SYSTEM PUSHES A COLD
FRONT THROUGH AND THE SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WEAKENS AND MOVES
THROUGH...NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIPITATION. THESE SHORTWAVES WILL
NEED TO BE WATCHED THOUGH IN CASE MORE MOISTURE THAN EXPECTED DOES
MAKE IT INTO THE AREA. ONCE THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON
WEDNESDAY...EXPECT ONLY A SLIGHT COOL DOWN IN TEMPERATURES...AS THE
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL KEEP COLDER TEMPERATURES LOCKED UP ACROSS THE
NORTHERN TIER OF THE U.S.

.FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...

FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD...EXPECTING UPPER TROUGH TO BECOME RE-
ESTABLISHED OVER THE WESTERN U.S. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SOUTHWESTERLY
UPPER FLOW TO SET UP OVER THE MID SOUTH. A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES
WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA IN THE FLOW ALOFT. THIS WILL
BRING A RETURN FOR RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE REGION BEGINNING FRIDAY
NIGHT AND PERSISTING THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS PATTERN WILL ALSO BE
CONDUCIVE TO SEASONABLY MILD CONDITIONS OVER THE AREA...WITH

PRESSURE IS BUILDING INTO THE AREA. THE HIGH WILL SETTLE OVER THE

A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL PATTERN IS SETTING UP OVER THE U.S.
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A FULL LATITUDE TROUGH DIGGING ACROSS THE
EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY...WITH A LARGE RIDGE BUILDING OUT WEST.
THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO DE-AMPLIFY BY MID WEEK.

.TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...

A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS FRONT WILL USHER IN MUCH COLDER
TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. IN ADDITION...A VERY TIGHT
PRESSURE GRADIENT REMAINS IN PLACE ALLOWING FOR STRONG NORTHWESTERLY
WINDS. THIS GRADIENT WILL REMAIN TIGHT THROUGH EARLY TONIGHT BEFORE
RELAXING FROM WEST TO EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODELS INDICATING WINDS
BETWEEN 35-45 KTS AT 925 MB THROUGH MIDNIGHT...AND WITH STEEP LOW
LEVEL LAPSE RATES IN PLACE AS INDICATED BY ETA12 FORECAST
SOUNDINGS...A FEW STRONG WIND GUSTS MAY STILL OCCUR EVEN AFTER DARK.
THEREFORE HAVE EXTENDED THE WIND ADVISORY THROUGH MIDNIGHT AND HAVE
INCLUDED THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA.

SKIES WILL CONTINUE TO CLEAR TONIGHT AS STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
OVERHEAD. STRONG SUBSIDENCE ON SUNDAY WILL BRING A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY.
LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE INTO THE AFTERNOON SUNDAY.
THIS WILL HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW AVERAGE THROUGH THE REMAINDER
OF THE WEEKEND. HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY SLIDE EAST OF THE AREA BY
SUNDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING WINDS TO RETURN OUT OF THE SOUTH AND
SOUTHWEST. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL ALSO BUILD EAST WITH SUBSTANTIAL
HEIGHT AND THICKNESS RISES FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...AS WARM
ADVECTION RETURNS IN EARNEST. THIS MEANS A RATHER QUICK REBOUND IN
TEMPERATURES MONDAY...AFTER A CHILLY START. DRY WEATHER AND
MODERATING TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE INTO MONDAY NIGHT.

.TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

A BROAD UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OVER THE MID SOUTH
THROUGH MID WEEK. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE CURRENTLY CUT OFF FROM
THE MAIN UPPER FLOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. WILL GRADUALLY LIFT
OUT TO THE EAST AS INDICATED BY THE MEDIUM RANGE FORECAST MODELS
(ECMWF & GFS). AT THIS TIME...THINK THAT SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED
DEEP MOISTURE WILL REMAIN FAR ENOUGH TO THE SOUTH TO KEEP
PRECIPITATION OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL NEED TO WATCH THE
EVENTUAL PROGRESSION OF THIS FEATURE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS TO
SEE HOW/IF IT WILL AFFECT OUR WEATHER. THINKING NOW IS JUST AN
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER.

THE UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME MORE ZONAL BY WEDNESDAY WITH ANOTHER
SHORTWAVE MOVING EAST...HELPING TO PUSH ANOTHER COLD FRONT ACROSS
THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. AT THIS TIME...MOISTURE APPEARS
LIMITED WITH THIS FRONT...SO KEEPING FORECAST DRY. SINCE THE FLOW
WILL BE MORE ZONAL...NOT EXPECTING MUCH OF A TEMPERATURE DROP WITH
THIS FRONT. A MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE WILL TRY AND APPROACH THE
REGION BY THE END OF NEXT WEEKEND...AND MAY BRING ANOTHER CHANCE
FOR MORE PRECIPITATION. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN NEAR OR ABOVE
AVERAGE FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO DE-AMPLIFY BY MID WEEK.

.TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...

A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS FRONT WILL USHER IN MUCH COLDER
TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. IN ADDITION...A VERY TIGHT
PRESSURE GRADIENT REMAINS IN PLACE ALLOWING FOR STRONG NORTHWESTERLY
WINDS. THIS GRADIENT WILL REMAIN TIGHT THROUGH EARLY TONIGHT BEFORE
RELAXING FROM WEST TO EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODELS INDICATING WINDS
BETWEEN 35-45 KTS AT 925 MB THROUGH MIDNIGHT...AND WITH STEEP LOW
LEVEL LAPSE RATES IN PLACE AS INDICATED BY ETA12 FORECAST
SOUNDINGS...A FEW STRONG WIND GUSTS MAY STILL OCCUR EVEN AFTER DARK.
THEREFORE HAVE EXTENDED THE WIND ADVISORY THROUGH MIDNIGHT AND HAVE
INCLUDED THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA.

SKIES WILL CONTINUE TO CLEAR TONIGHT AS STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
OVERHEAD. STRONG SUBSIDENCE ON SUNDAY WILL BRING A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY.
LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE INTO THE AFTERNOON SUNDAY.
THIS WILL HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW AVERAGE THROUGH THE REMAINDER
OF THE WEEKEND. HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY SLIDE EAST OF THE AREA BY
SUNDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING WINDS TO RETURN OUT OF THE SOUTH AND
SOUTHWEST. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL ALSO BUILD EAST WITH SUBSTANTIAL
HEIGHT AND THICKNESS RISES FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...AS WARM
ADVECTION RETURNS IN EARNEST. THIS MEANS A RATHER QUICK REBOUND IN
TEMPERATURES MONDAY...AFTER A CHILLY START. DRY WEATHER AND
MODERATING TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE INTO MONDAY NIGHT.

.TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...

A BROAD UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OVER THE MID SOUTH
THROUGH MID WEEK. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE CURRENTLY CUT OFF FROM
THE MAIN UPPER FLOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. WILL GRADUALLY LIFT
OUT TO THE EAST AS INDICATED BY THE MEDIUM RANGE FORECAST MODELS
(ECMWF & GFS). AT THIS TIME...THINK THAT SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED
DEEP MOISTURE WILL REMAIN FAR ENOUGH TO THE SOUTH TO KEEP
PRECIPITATION OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL NEED TO WATCH THE
EVENTUAL PROGRESSION OF THIS FEATURE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS TO
SEE HOW/IF IT WILL AFFECT OUR WEATHER. THINKING NOW IS JUST AN
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER.

THE UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME MORE ZONAL BY WEDNESDAY WITH ANOTHER
SHORTWAVE MOVING EAST...HELPING TO PUSH ANOTHER COLD FRONT ACROSS
THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. AT THIS TIME...MOISTURE APPEARS
LIMITED WITH THIS FRONT...SO KEEPING FORECAST DRY. SINCE THE FLOW
WILL BE MORE ZONAL...NOT EXPECTING MUCH OF A TEMPERATURE DROP WITH
THIS FRONT. A MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE WILL TRY AND APPROACH THE
REGION BY THE END OF NEXT WEEKEND...AND MAY BRING ANOTHER CHANCE
FOR MORE PRECIPITATION. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN NEAR OR ABOVE
AVERAGE FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

ARCTIC COLD AIRMASS IS LOCATED BEHIND THIS FRONT...WITH TEMPERATURES
ALREADY FALLING THROUGH THE TEENS IN SOUTH-CENTRAL MISSOURI AS OF

SCENARIO. SKIES WILL GRADUALLY SCATTER OUT FROM NORTHWEST TO
SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE DAY...WITH EVERYONE BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY BY

.DISCUSSION...00Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS CENTERS UPPER LEVEL LOW ACROSS 
MINNESOTA WITH AN EMBEDDED SHORTWAVE LOCATED IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
AND ANOTHER WAVE IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS.  MAIN FORECAST 
CONCERNS THIS FORECAST PACKAGE WILL BE WIND ADVISORY POTENTIAL TODAY 
AND TONIGHT. 

TODAY...SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING PLACES COLD FRONT ALONG THE 
MISSOURI/ARKANSAS BORDER. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS MORNING WITH TEMPERATURES FALLING THROUGHOUT THE DAY INTO 
THE UPPER 30S TO MIDDLE 40S. I AM A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT WIND 
ADVISORY POTENTIAL FOR TODAY WITH SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 
1008MB OVER MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND LOW AND 1034 MB HIGH ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS. SUSTAINED NORTHWEST WINDS IN THE 20KT RANGE WITH 
GUSTS EARLY THIS MORNING BEING REPORTED AROUND 44KTS ACROSS 
NORTHEAST NEBRASKA...ALONG WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOWING 40KT WINDS 
AT 850 MB MIXING DOWN TO THE SURFACE AT LEAST THROUGH MID EVENING. 
THIS DATA SUPPORTS A WIND ADVISORY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...AT 
LEAST DOWN TO THE TENNESSEE/MISSISSIPPI STATE LINE THROUGH MIDNIGHT. 
AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT AREAS ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND A 
SECTION OF ADJACENT ARKANSAS WILL HAVE WINDS BELOW WIND ADVISORY 
CRITERIA...AND WILL LET DAY SHIFT RE-ANALYZE ADVISORY POTENTIAL 
ACROSS THIS AREA CURRENTLY NOT COVERED. MOISTURE WILL BE QUITE 
LIMITED WITH THIS FRONT AND EXPECT A FEW SPRINKLES AT BEST ACROSS 
SOUTH AND EAST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH A RELATIVELY DRY 
ATMOSPHERE. 

TONIGHT...PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL BEGIN TO WEAKEN ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA INTO THE EVENING HOURS AS STRONG SURFACE HIGH DROPS FROM THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. WINDS WILL ALSO 
GRADUALLY WEAKEN TOWARDS MORNING. EXPECTING MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS 1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S DROP BELOW 30 
PERCENT. COLD AIR ADVECTION AND DECENT RADIATIONAL COOLING SUPPORTS 
LOWS DROPPING INTO THE LOWER 20S. 

SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...SURFACE HIGH AND ASSOCIATED UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING WILL GRADUALLY SETTLE IN ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
AS A RESULT...NOT EXPECTING ANY RAINFALL CHANCES THROUGH THIS TIME 
FRAME WITH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW NORMAL. UPPER LEVEL 
LOW CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED STATES WILL 
BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE SOUTHEAST U.S. BY TUESDAY...BUT APPEARS TO 
STILL SLIDE TO THE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND WILL KEEP FORECAST 
DRY FOR NOW.

NO CHANGES MADE BEYOND TUESDAY.

THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL ONCE AGAIN BECOME HIGHLY AMPLIFIED OVER
THE UNITED STATES THIS WEEKEND AS A STRONG SHORTWAVE DIVES SOUTHWARD
INTO THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. IN THE WAKE OF THE SHORTWAVE...A DEEP
FULL LATITUDE TROUGH WILL BECOME ESTABLISHED EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER WITH A LARGE UPPER RIDGE TO THE WEST.


.TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...

A LEAD SHORTWAVE WILL DIG SOUTHEAST TONIGHT FROM THE UPPER PLAINS
STATES SOUTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY SATURDAY MORNING. AHEAD
OF THIS SHORTWAVE...A WARM FRONT NOW OVER NORTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI
WILL MOVE NORTH THROUGH THE AREA LATER TONIGHT. THIS WILL KEEP
OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING TOO MUCH THROUGH MOST OF
TONIGHT. AS THE LEAD SHORTWAVE MOVES FURTHER SOUTHEAST...IT WILL
HELP TO SEND A STRONG COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE AREA EARLY SATURDAY
MORNING. LOW LEVEL RETURN FLOW WILL BE SHORT-LIVED TONIGHT...SO NOT
EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN. WITH LIMITED
MOISTURE IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE FRONT...ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS HAVE BEEN INCLUDED FOR SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES. NOT
CONFIDENT THAT EVEN THESE AREAS WILL SEE MUCH RAINFALL. STRONG LOW
LEVEL COLD ADVECTION WILL BEGIN IN EARNEST BY MID MORNING ON
SATURDAY BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...SO EXPECT HIGH TEMPERATURES TO
OCCUR EARLY IN THE DAY...WITH FALLING TEMPERATURES THROUGH MOST OF
THE DAY SATURDAY. THE MAIN SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
AREA SATURDAY EVENING. THE CORE OF THE COLDEST AIR WILL BE USHERED
INTO THE REGION WITH THIS SHORTWAVE. IN ADDITION...A FEW FLURRIES
MAY BE SQUEEZED OUT ACROSS NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH
AHEAD OF THE MAIN SHORTWAVE. A STRONG 1041 MB HIGH PRESSURE WILL
BUILD IN BEHIND THE FRONT FOR LATER SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...
BRINGING CLEARING SKIES AND ANOTHER BLAST OF COLD ARCTIC AIR.

.SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY SLIDE SOUTHEAST WITH UPPER LEVEL
RIDGING BUILDING OVER THE AREA. EXPECT DRY CONDITIONS AND A FAIRLY
QUICK MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES BEGINNING MONDAY AFTER A CHILLY
START. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO WARM THROUGH MID WEEK. AN
UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. THIS WEEKEND WILL PULL OUT ACROSS
THE GULF COAST STATES DURING THE TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME. AT
THIS TIME ANTICIPATING DEEP MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE
TO REMAIN SOUTH...SO HAVE KEPT POPS OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR THIS
TIME PERIOD. WE WILL NEED TO CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS TO MAKE SURE
MOISTURE DOES INDEED REMAIN SOUTH. OTHERWISE...CONTINUED DRY. ANOTHER
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...BUT WITH
LIMITED MOISTURE. SO NO RAIN EXPECTED WITH THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE. THE
BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN IN THE EXTENDED WILL COME BY THE END OF THE
WEEK AS ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM ORGANIZES OVER THE PLAINS STATES AND
MOVES EAST.

THROUGH MOST OF THE AFTERNOON AS PER ETA12 FORECAST SOUNDINGS...
THEREFORE HAVE CUT BACK TEMPERATURES QUITE A BIT OVER THESE AREAS.
ELSEWHERE...PLENTY OF SUN SHOULD HELP TEMPERATURES REACH NEAR

THIS FEATURE MOVES THROUGH. SURFACE WINDS SHOULD BACK AROUND TO THE

DEGREES COOLER ON FRIDAY AS COMPARED TO TODAY. THE LOW LEVEL FLOW
SHOULD EVENTUALLY COME BACK AROUND SOUTHEASTERLY BY FRIDAY EVENING.

.FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...
A STRONGER SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL DROP OUT OF THE CANADIAN PRAIRIES
INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES ON FRIDAY AND THEN SOUTHEASTWARD
ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEYS ON SATURDAY NIGHT. AHEAD
OF THIS SYSTEM...WE SHOULD SEE A SHORT PERIOD OF RETURN LOW LEVEL
SOUTHERLY FLOW ON FRIDAY NIGHT. SOME MOISTURE SHOULD MOVE BACK NORTH
OVER THE AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING. THE BIG
QUESTION WILL BE HOW MUCH MOISTURE. AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT
MOISTURE MAY REMAIN SOMEWHAT LIMITED WITH BOTH THE ETA AND GFS MODELS
BACKING OFF SIGNIFICANTLY ON PRECIPITATION CHANCES FOR LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT AND SATURDAY. HAVE DECIDED TO TRIM BACK RAIN CHANCES FOR THIS
TIME PERIOD...BUT WOULD LIKE TO SEE ANOTHER MODEL RUN OR TWO TO SEE
IF THIS TREND REMAINS CONSISTENT. IF THIS DRY TREND CONTINUES...MAY
NEED TO CUT BACK EVEN FURTHER ON FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY POPS.

AS THIS SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH IT WILL HELP TO RECARVE A DEEP

FRONT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH ON SATURDAY. THERE ARE SOME MODEL TIMING
ISSUES WITH REGARD TO THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...WITH THE GFS ABOUT 6
HOURS EARLIER THAN THE ETA. THE GFS BRINGS THE FRONT THROUGH AROUND
12Z SATURDAY...WITH THE ETA HOLDING BACK UNTIL LATE MORNING. AT
THIS TIME...THINK THAT THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH MID TO LATE
MORNING ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AND EARLY AFTERNOON FOR POINTS
FURTHER EAST. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA BY
SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH FALLING TEMPERATURES EXPECTED. THE STRONG
SHORTWAVE SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH BY SATURDAY NIGHT. WITH

.DISCUSSION...
A STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDED ACROSS SOUTHEAST MISSOURI...NORTHWEST TN 
INTO MIDDLE TN THIS MORNING. SATELLITE SHOWS A BROKEN STREAM OF HIGH 
CLOUDS MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD. WINDS THIS MORNING ARE RATHER LIGHT 
WHICH HAS ALLOWED TEMPS TO FALL TO NEAR THE DEW POINT IN MANY 
LOCATIONS. 

TODAY...EXPECT THE STATIONARY FRONT TO MOVE NORTHWARD AS A WARM 
FRONT IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT CLIPPER SYSTEM THAT IS OVER SOUTH 
DAKOTA AT THIS TIME. EXPECT SKY COVER TO BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY IN 
THAT ANY BROKEN OR OVERCAST DECKS IN THE HIGH CLOUDS WILL BE 
SHORT-LIVED RESULTING IN A PARTLY SUNNY DAY. LOOKING AT THE 
EXPERIMENTAL ACARS SOUNDING DATA FROM MEMPHIS THIS 
MORNING...ASSUMING A GOOD AMOUNT OF SUN THEN HIGHS SHOULD APPROACH 
THE 60 DEGREE MARK THIS AFTERNOON. SINCE THE BETTER WARMING IN 
COMING OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST...TEMPS WILL BE A LITTLE COOLER NORTH 
AND EAST TODAY. 

THE CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL ARRIVE THIS EVENING AND DRAG A WEAK COLD 
FRONT...REALLY MORE OF A WIND SHIFT THROUGH THE REGION. WEAK 
DYNAMICS AND DRY LOW LEVELS SO NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIPITATION WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...JUST OCCASIONAL HIGH CLOUDINESS. THE FRONT SHOULD 
REMAIN SOUTH OF THE REGION INTO FRIDAY. HOWEVER THERE APPEARS TO BE 
NO REAL TEMPERATURE CONTRAST ALONG THE FRONT. GUIDANCE APPEARS WAY 
TO CLOUDY COMPARED TO THE GRIDDED DATA WHICH SHOWS PRIMARILY HIGH 
CLOUDS WITH THE REAL OVERCAST SKIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEXT 
SIGNIFICANT FRONT COMING IN LATE IN THE DAY. THIS COULD EXPLAIN WHY 
GUIDANCE IS COOLER. EXPECT HIGHS TO BE CLOSE TO TODAYS EXPECTED 
HIGHS. 

THE FRONT WILL SURGE NORTHWARD FRIDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS SOUTHERN MISSOURI AND INTO SOUTHERN 
ILLINOIS. THIS WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS 
TOWARDS DAWN. DYNAMICS WITH THE FRONT ARE RELATIVELY WEAK UNTIL 
DURING THE DAY ON SATURDAY. THEN A STRONG VORT MAX WILL BEGIN TO 
DROP OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THIS WILL PUSH MUCH COLDER AIR DOWN 
THE PLAINS RESULTING IN A STRONGER FRONT DURING THE DAY. EXPECT 
SHOWERS TO BREAK OUT ALONG THE FRONT ALTHOUGH UNCERTAIN AS TO 
WHEN/WHERE. THE 00Z RUN OF THE ETA APPEARS TO HAVE SOME CONVECTIVE 
PROBLEMS. IT SURGES THE INSTABILITY UP NORTH WAY TOO FAST. THE 06Z 
RUN OF THE ETA ALREADY IS BACKING OFF OF THIS. THE GFS SEEMS TO HAVE 
A BETTER HANDLE ON THE SYSTEM IMPLYING ONLY A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS 
ALONG THE FRONT. THUS...HAVE SIDED MORE TOWARDS THE MAV POPS AND 
WOULDNT BE TOTALLY SHOCKED IF MUCH OF THE REGION REMAINED DRY. BOTH 
MODELS SHOW A DRY SLOT MOVING IN DURING THE AFTERNOON ON SATURDAY SO 
DONT BE SURPRISED IF THE SUN MADE AN APPEARANCE FOR A TIME. 
HOWEVER...THE UPPER VORT AND ASSOCIATED COLD AIR WILL MOVE BACK IN 
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 850 TEMPS ON BOTH GFS/ETA ARE 
AROUND -15...SO EXPECTING A DECK OF LOW CLOUDS TO COME DOWN AND 
WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF A FEW FLURRIES COULD GET SQUEEZED OUT.

.DISCUSSION...
WARM AIR ADVECTION HAS BEEN OCCURRING OVERNIGHT. AS A RESULT...MANY 
LOCATIONS HAVE ACTUALLY SEEN TEMPERATURES RISING THROUGHOUT THE 
NIGHT. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS A DECK OF 5-6000FT CLOUDS MOVING OVER 
THE REGION FROM THE WEST WITH 10-15000FT CLOUDS MOVING SOUTH FROM 
THE NORTH AHEAD OF THE NEXT SHORTWAVE. THE SHORTWAVE DOES HAVE A 
SURFACE FEATURE WITH IT ALTHOUGH NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF COLD AIR 
BEHIND IT...MORE OF A WIND SHIFT TO THE WEST/NORTHWEST. RADAR 
IMAGERY FROM PADUCAH AND MEMPHIS HAS HAD A FEW RETURNS...BUT SURFACE 
OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT THIS IS NOTHING MORE THAN VIRGA. DO NOT 
EXPECT ANY PRECIPITATION WITH THIS SYSTEM SINCE LOW LEVELS ARE 
INCREDIBLY DRY AND UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION IS RELATIVELY WEAK.

GENERALLY FAVOR THE WAY THAT THE MAV HANDLES THE SKY CONDITIONS FOR 
TODAY WITH CLEARING SKIES OVER MUCH OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. 
AREAS SOUTH OF A LINE FROM TUPELO TO CLARKSDALE MAY NOT SEE THE 
CLEARING TILL LATE IN THE DAY...PERHAPS EVEN THIS EVENING. NO MAJOR 
CHANGES MADE TO THE TEMP FORECAST FOR TODAY OR TONIGHT. 

ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE/CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL ARRIVE TOMORROW AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. ONCE AGAIN...WEAK DYNAMICS AND DRY LOW LEVELS WILL 
HINDER ANY PRECIPITATION. SKY FORECAST LOOKS PROBLEMATIC WITH THE 
GFS SHOWING MUCH MORE IN THE WAY OF CLOUDS WITH THIS SYSTEM THAN THE 
ETA. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY HAVE DECIDED TO KEEP PARTLY CLOUDY GOING 
FOR NOW AND TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT IT ON THE 12Z MODEL RUNS. RAISED 
TEMPS SLIGHTLY FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT TO FALL MORE INTO 
LINE WITH GUIDANCE WHICH LOOKS REASONABLE. 

FRIDAY LOOKS DRY STILL WITH CLOUD COVER STILL AN ISSUE. THE FRONT 
WILL BEGIN TO MOVE EASTWARD AS A WARM FRONT BUT HOW FAST THIS FRONT 
MOVES OUT OF THE AREA AND HOW MUCH LOW CLOUDS IS ASSOCIATED WITH IT 
IS STILL IN QUESTION. THE GFS IS MUCH FASTER WITH THE FRONT AND MORE 
AGGRESSIVE ON THE WARM AIR ADVECTION THAN THE ETA/EUROPEAN 
SOLUTIONS. FAVOR THE TIMING OF THE ETA/EUROPEAN SOLUTIONS WHICH IS 
NOT AS WARM AS THE GFS ON FRIDAY AND BRINGS THE FRONT THROUGH DURING 
THE DAY ON SATURDAY. ATMOSPHERE TOO STABLE FOR THUNDERSTORMS. THE 
FORECAST WILL LINGER THE PRECIPITATION INTO SATURDAY EVENING...THIS 
IS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY OF FRONTAL PASSAGE THAN ANYTHING. EUROPEAN/GFS 
BOTH SHOW A SUBSTANTIAL AMOUNT OF COLD AIR POURING INTO THE REGION 
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM WITH 850 TEMPS FALLING BELOW -10...AS 
LOW AS -15 ON THE GFS. IF THERE IS ANY MOISTURE LEFT ON THE BACKSIDE 
OF THE SYSTEM...A FLURRY COULDNT BE ENTIRELY RULED OUT. HAVE LOWERED 
MIN TEMPS SAT NITE AND HIGHS ON SUNDAY DRASTICALLY DUE TO THIS 
PLUNGE OF COLD AIR. ALTHOUGH IT LOOKS LIKE A QUICK HITTING SHOT WITH 
THE TROUGH MOVING EAST OF THE REGION BY MONDAY AND A WARMING TREND 
AGAIN TOWARDS MIDWEEK.

AROUND 5K FT DURING THE DAY TOMORROW...BUT OTHER THAN THAT...PRETTY
MUCH CLEAR SAILING THROUGH FRIDAY.

CONSIDERING CLEAR SKIES...VERY LOW DEWPOINTS...LIGHT WINDS AND COLD
AIR MASS...MAV MINS FOR TONIGHT APPEAR TO BE TOO WARM. THAT BEING
SAID...OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL LIKELY OCCUR BEFORE MIDNIGHT...ESPECIALLY
IN THE WEST...AS GRADIENT/WIND INCREASES. CURRENT FORECAST IS NEAR
MET GUIDANCE FOR TONIGHT...EXCEPT AT TUPELO. WILL LEAVE CURRENT
FORECAST AS IS...BLENDS PRETTY WELL WITH NEIGHBORS.

LEVELS. IF CLOUDS LINGER TOO LONG...THIS MAY BE OVERDONE. FWC
GUIDANCE LOOKS UNUSUALLY WARM...MAV MORE REPRESENTATIVE. WEDNESDAY
NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AS IS. ETA
INDICATES SIGNIFICANT COOLING ON FRIDAY...GFS MUCH LESS SO. TRENDED
TOWARD GFS/MAV GUIDANCE...WHICH IS ACTUALLY NEAR CLIMO.

NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED IN THE EXTENDED FORECAST...WITH RESPECT TO

ONE MORE COLD SHOT ON SUNDAY...BUT APPEARS TO ONLY HANG AROUND 24-36
HOURS. GFS SOLUTION AFTER MONDAY SHOWS WESTERN RIDGE FLATTENING OUT
WITH NO SIGNIFICANT INTRUSIONS OF COLD AIR FOR MUCH OF NEXT WEEK.
WHAT I HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LOOK AT OF THE UKMET AND ECMWF SUPPORT
FLATTENING OF WRN RIDGE. EXPECTING TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL FROM

THIS MORNINGS SURFACE MAP PLACES HIGH PRESSURE OVER EAST CENTRAL 
ILLINOIS. WINDS OVER THE REGION ARE OUT OF THE NORTHEAST THIS 
MORNING BUT SHOULD WORK THEIR WAY AROUND TO THE SOUTHEAST LATER 
TODAY AS THE HIGH MOVES OFF TO THE EAST. ANOTHER COLD DAY IN STORE 
WITH THE ARCTIC HIGH STILL NEARBY. TEMPS WILL RANGE FROM THE MID 30S 
OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND NORTHWEST TN TO AROUND 40 OVER NORTHERN 
MS. 

WINDS WILL STAY UP TONIGHT AS A WEAK UPPER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA. THIS WILL BRING A MIX OF CLEAR SKIES AND CLOUDS. 
COMBINED WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION OVER THE REGION...TEMPS SHOULD 
BEGIN TO WARM UP. PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WILL CONTINUE INTO WEDNESDAY 
WITH HIGHS APPROACHING 50 DEGREES. A WEAK COOL FRONT WILL ARRIVE 
LATE THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. CURRENT MODELS INDICATE THAT 
MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND LIFT ALONG THE FRONT BOTH APPEAR TO 
BE A PROBLEM AS FAR AS RAINFALL GOES. 

THE BETTER CHANCE FOR RAIN IS STILL FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY WHEN 
ANOTHER SYSTEM IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW WILL APPROACH THE REGION. THE 
BETTER LIFT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER VORT AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE 
LOW WHICH LOOKS LIKE IT WILL TRACK JUST NORTH OF THE REGION. 
STILL...THERE MAY BE ENOUGH LIFT ALONG THE FRONT TO SQUEEZE OUT A 
FEW RAIN SHOWERS. AFTERWARDS...NORTHWEST FLOW SETUP CONTINUES OVER 
THE AREA ALTHOUGH NO SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS TO SPEAK OF.

ONLY MINOR CHANGES NEEDED IN THE CURRENT FORECAST. THE STRONG 
SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING ACROSS SRN ILLINOIS THIS MORNING CAN BE SEEN 
ON WATER VAPOR ANIMATION. LOWER CLOUD DECK OVER SRN MO CREEPING INTO 
NE AR THIS MORNING. EXPECT THESE CLOUDS TO CLIP THE NORTHERN TWO 
THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. THE REAL STORY WILL BE THE COLD 
ADVECTION THAT WILL TAKE PLACE TODAY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. IT WILL 
BE A NOTICEABLY COOLER DAY AS THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE OPENS THE 
COLD AIR FLOOD GATES. CURRENT TEMPERATURES IN STL IS 14 DEGREES 
GRADUALLY WARMING TO THE MID 20S IN THE MO BOOTHEEL.

SOME HIGH CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE MID SOUTH LATE SUNDAY 
NIGHT. THE MAIN EFFECT THE CLOUDS WILL HAVE IS ON 
TEMPERATURES...DEPENDING ON THE THICKNESS OF THEM. CURRENT THINKING 
IS THAT THEY WILL BE THIN AND GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING SHOULD STILL 
TAKE PLACE. OTHERWISE...MIN TEMPS MONDAY MORNING WILL BE A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER. BY MONDAY...MORE MID LEVEL MOISTURE/CLOUDS WILL 
DRIFT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AFFECTING INSOLATION. SO EXPECT A 
MIRROR TO SUNDAY AS FAR AS MAX TEMPS ON MONDAY. 

A DRY FORECAST CONTINUES THROUGH MOST OF NEXT WEEK. THE LONG RANGE 
MODELS YESTERDAY WERE ADVERTISING POSSIBLE RAIN CHANCES FRIDAY NIGHT 
INTO SATURDAY. THE GFS HAS FLOPPED TO A DRY FORECAST AND A DIFFERENT 
PATTERN OVER THE REGION. EVEN THE ECMWF AND NOGAPS HAVE COME TO 
AGREEMENT WITH THIS DRIER SOLUTION. WILL LEAVE FORECAST AS IS FOR 
NOW AND LET NEXT SHIFT RE-EVALUATE IN GREATER DETAIL.

HIGH CLOUDS HAVE MOVED INTO THE MIDSOUTH THIS EVENING. CLOUDS SHOULD 
MOVE THROUGH CWA OVER NEXT FEW HOURS...LEAVING THE MIDSOUTH WITH A 
BRIEF BREAK BEFORE SCATTERED LOWER CLOUDS MOVE IN BY MORNING. 
CURRENT FORECAST HAS PARTLY CLOUDY WHICH LOOKS GOOD. TEMPERATURES 
ARE NEAR WHAT THEY WERE LAST NIGHT. TEMPS DIDN/T QUITE DROP AS LOW 
AS EXPECTED LAST NIGHT BUT COLDER AIR IS BEGINNING TO MAKE ITS WAY 
INTO SOUTHERN MISSOURI THIS EVENING. EXPECT THE COLD AIR TO CONTINUE ITS 
MOVEMENT SOUTHWARD OVERNIGHT SO WILL LEAVE FORECASTED LOWS ALONE. NO 
UPDATES ARE EXPECTED.

.DISCUSSION...
NOT MUCH HAPPENING WEATHER WISE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AS
SCATTERED CIRRUS CLOUDS CONTINUE TO TRACK ACROSS THE REGION. SOME
CHANGES ARE IN STORE OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS AS AN UPPER LEVEL
SHORT WAVE DIVES SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE CANADIAN ROCKIES AND REACHES
NORTHERN KENTUCKY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THIS SYSTEM WILL NOT PRODUCE
ANY PRECIPITATION FOR THE FORECAST AREA...BUT IT WILL HELP BRING A
REINFORCING SHOT OF THE COLD AIR ALREADY IN PLACE OVER THE REGION.
BECAUSE OF THIS TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLDER ON SUNDAY WITH HIGHS IN
MOST LOCATIONS REMAINING BELOW 40 DEGREES. HIGH PRESSURE WILL COVER
MUCH OF THE CENTRAL U.S. BY SUNDAY NIGHT AND WITH MOSTLY CLEAR
SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE TEENS IN MOST
LOCATIONS. THE HIGH WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT TO THE EAST ALLOWING
TEMPERATURES TO SLOWLY WARM UP THROUGH THE UPCOMING WEEK. A STORM
SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON FRIDAY AND MOVE
EAST WHICH SHOULD MEAN A CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THE FORECAST AREA NEXT
WEEKEND.

HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS CONTINUES TO STREAM OVER THE MID SOUTH THIS 
MORNING. ADDITIONAL CLOUDS WILL DRIFT ACROSS MAINLY THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. MAX TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER 
THAN YESTERDAY AS THE SURFACE HIGH BUILDS FARTHER EAST AND WEAK COLD 
ADVECTION OCCURS.

FOCUS WILL SHIFT TO A SHORTWAVE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS TONIGHT. IT 
WILL SWING ACROSS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS/INDIANA EARLY SUNDAY. THIS WILL 
PUSH MORE COLD AIR INTO THE REGION SUNDAY. EXPECTING MAX TEMPS 
SUNDAY TO BE ANYWHERE FROM 3 TO 5 DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY. 
OVERNIGHT LOWS SUNDAY NIGHT WILL BE THE COLDEST FROM THIS COLD 
BLAST. A SLOW WARM UP WILL OCCUR THROUGH NEXT WEEK.

LOOKING FARTHER OUT...WE WILL HAVE TO KEEP OUR EYE ON TWO SYSTEMS. 
ONE SOUTHERN STORM SYSTEM THAT THE LATEST GFS MODEL PICKS UP ON OFF 
THE COAST OF BAJA ON THURSDAY MORNING. THE OTHER SYSTEM IS A STRONG 
SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHWEST U.S. DURING THE SAME TIME 
FRAME. THE NOGAPS AND EUROPEAN MODELS AGREE WITH BOTH OF THESE 
FEATURES AT THIS TIME FRAME. WILL AWAIT ANOTHER MODEL RUN TO SEE 
WHAT SORT OF CONSISTENCY THE MODEL SOLUTIONS COME UP WITH. BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT...THESE TWO STORM SYSTEMS WOULD MERGE AND PRODUCE OUR NEXT 
CHANCE OF RAIN INTO SATURDAY. FOR NOW WE WILL LEAVE THE FORECAST DRY 
PENDING AT LEAST ANOTHER RUN OF THE GFS.

QUIET WEATHER EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS. A BROAD UPPER TROUGH 
HAS SET UP OVER THE EASTERN 3/4 OF THE U.S. WILL BRING SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE INTO THE MID SOUTH. THE HIGH WILL SLOWLY SHIFT EASTWARD 
FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS THROUGH SUNDAY AS IT BUILDS INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY. IT WILL BE REPLACED BY ANOTHER SURFACE HIGH TO THE NORTH IN 
THE WAKE OF A SHORTWAVE SWINGING INTO THE GREAT LAKES SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. THIS WILL GENERAL CAUSE COOL TEMPERATURES AND DRY WEATHER 
FOR THE FORECAST AREA. BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...THE BROAD TROUGH WILL 
PUSH INTO THE EASTERN U.S. AND A BROAD RIDGE SET UP OUT WEST. THIS 
PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND. EXPECT STORMS TO TRACK 
ALONG THE NORTHERN BRANCH...ACROSS MN...WI AND MI RATHER THAN THIS 
FAR SOUTH. ANY MOISTURE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WILL BE VERY LIMITED. 
IN ADDITION...THERE WILL BE A LACK OF ANY SIGNIFICANT LIFTING

ACTIVE WEATHER IN STORE FOR LATER TONIGHT. THIS WILL BE THE MAIN 
FOCUS OF THE DISCUSSION. IN THE VERY SHORT TERM...A FEW WARM AIR 
ADVECTION SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA...BUT NOTHING 
SIGNIFICANT UNTIL LATER TONIGHT. WILL LET WIND ADVISORY EXPIRE AT 4 
PM GIVEN THAT MOST LOCATIONS ARE UNDER ADVISORY CRITERIA. STILL WILL 
BE BREEZY TONIGHT.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CLEARLY SHOWS UPPER TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER THE TX 
AND OK PANHANDLES. THE TROUGH WILL ADVANCE EAST TONIGHT WHILE 
PUSHING ALONG A STRONG COLD FRONT. VERY STRONG DYNAMICS WILL SETUP 
TONIGHT WITH THIS SYSTEM AS A 140 KT JET STREAK ROUNDS THE 
TROUGH...PUTTING THE CWA UNDER THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION. THIS 
COMBINED WITH STRONG 1000-850MB FRONTOGENESIS WILL HELP TO ORGANIZE 
A SQUALL LINE ACROSS EASTERN OK...NE TX...AND WESTERN ARKANSAS THIS 
EVENING. THE LINE WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD THROUGH THE NIGHT. STILL 
SOME MINOR TIMING DIFFERENCES BUT FEEL THE LINE WILL AFFECT EAST 
ARKANSAS AND THE MO BOOTHEEL BETWEEN 06-09Z...CROSSES THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER BETWEEN 09-12Z...AND NE MS AND AREAS ALONG THE TN 
RIVER BETWEEN 12-15Z. AS HAS BEEN ADVERTISED FOR QUITE SOME 
TIME...WIND FIELDS WITH THIS SYSTEM ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE. A 70 KT LOW 
LEVEL JET WILL SET UP AHEAD OF THE SQUALL LINE. THIS DEFINITELY 
INFERS A DAMAGING WIND THREAT. THE FLY IN THE OINTMENT FOR SEVERE 
WEATHER WILL BE THE LACK OF INSTABILITY. ETA SHOWING VERY MEAGER MID 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES WHILE THE GFS SHOWS MUCH BETTER ACROSS THE AREA. 
ONE THING TO NOTE IS THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALREADY FIRING WELL TO OUR 
WEST IN AREAS WHERE MODELS ARE SHOWING LOWER LAPSE RATES. BOTTOM 
LINE IS THAT THERE IS A CHANCE FOR DAMAGING WINDS ALONG THE LINE 
WITH AN ISOLATED TORNADO POSSIBLE GIVEN IMPRESSIVE 0-1KM STORM 
RELATIVE HELICTITY. WILL MAINTAIN SEVERE MENTION IN ZONES. CURRENT 
HWO HANDLES SITUATION WELL. THE LINE WILL PRODUCE HEAVY DOWNPOURS 
BUT GIVEN PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF THE SYSTEM HAVE DECIDED TO HOLD OFF 
ON ANY FLOOD WATCHES.

WITH THE FRONT EXPECTED TO BE NEAR THE RIVER AT 12Z...THIS WILL PLAY 
HAVOC ON POPS AND TEMPS. AS FOR POPS...HAVE ALL AREAS 100 POPS AT 
SOME POINT AND TRIED TO ACCOUNT FOR TIMING THE BEST I COULD. HIGH 
TEMPS WILL LIKELY BE NEAR OR JUST AFTER 12Z AND REFLECTED THIS IN 
THE GRIDS. WILL LEAVE A 30 POP IN FOR EXTREME EAST ZONES AFTER 18Z 
TOMORROW TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY LINGERING PRECIP.

MUCH COLDER AIR TO FOLLOW FOR THE END OF THE WEEK AND INTO THE 
WEEKEND. MODELS ARE NOW SHOWING MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW ACROSS OUR AREA 
WHICH WILL SERVE TO KEEP THE CORE OF THE ARCTIC COLD NORTH OF THE 
AREA. GIVEN THAT THIS IS VERY COLD SIBERIAN AIR AND EXTREMELY 
DENSE...FEEL SOME OF IT WILL BE ABLE TO BLEED INTO THE AREA. 
THEREFORE...WILL CONTINUE TO UNDERCUT GUIDANCE. NO PRECIP FORESEEN 
THROUGH DAY 7 AND THE MAJORITY OF THE EXTENDED WAS NOT CHANGED MUCH.

THANKS GOES OUT TO WFO NASHVILLE FOR THEIR COORDINATION.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY POSITIONED WELL TO THE NORTH OF THE MID SOUTH THIS
MORNING AND STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP THE
ENTIRE AREA WELL ENTRENCHED IN THE WARM SECTOR TODAY. TEMPERATURES
WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY RISE AND CURRENT FORECAST HIGHS NEAR 70
NORTH TO LOWER 70S CENTRAL AND SOUTH PORTIONS LOOKS ON TRACK.
EXTENSIVE CLOUD SHIELD OVER MOST OF THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING WITH
THE MOST BREAKS CURRENTLY OCCURRING OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS. THINK
THAT OVERALL FORECAST CLOUD COVER IS ON TRACK AS WELL. WIND FIELDS
WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THIS AFTERNOON...AND AS WE GET A FEW
MORE BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS...ANTICIPATING SOME MIXING TO OCCUR. STRONG
45 KT WINDS INDICATED BY KNQA VAD WIND PROFILER AT 3 KFT...SO WILL
NOT TAKE MUCH MIXING TO GET ADVISORY TYPE WINDS TO THE SURFACE. WILL
KEEP WIND ADVISORY IN PLACE FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. PLAN AT
THIS TIME TO LOWER POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THIS AFTERNOON AS DONT
SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF A TRIGGER TO INITIATE MUCH CONVECTION
AREAWIDE. IN ADDITION...REGIONAL ETA12 FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING
DECENT MID-LEVEL CAPPING OF THE ATMOSPHERE. A FEW WARM ADVECTION
SHOWERS MAY DEVELOP BELOW THIS INVERSION...JUSTIFYING THE 20 POPS.

A QUICK LOOK AT NEW 12Z ETA RUN...SHOWING UPPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT STILL PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS REGION TONIGHT...
BUT MODEL INDICATING THAT THE UPPER TROUGH MAY BEGIN TO SHEAR OUT
LATER TONIGHT. SQUALL LINE STILL EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AND MOVE INTO
AREA LATE TONIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING. THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE
INSTABILITY. MODEL TENDS TO WEAKEN MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND WITH
CONVECTION MOVING THROUGH DURING OVERNIGHT HOURS...MAY TEND TO LIMIT
INSTABILITY. WE WILL NEED TO SEE HOW THE UPPER TROUGH EVOLVES AS IT
MOVES EASTWARD SINCE THIS WILL PLAY A MAJOR ROLE IN AMOUNT OF
INSTABILITY AVAILABLE. AT THIS TIME THINK THAT SLIGHT RISK SEVERE
POTENTIAL STILL EXISTS...WITH VERY STRONG WIND FIELDS IN PLACE...BUT
LEVEL OF INSTABILITY WILL DETERMINE OVERALL EXTENT OF SEVERE WEATHER
POTENTIAL.

OKLAHOMA. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS SEVERE 
WEATHER POTENTIAL FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.

TODAY...LOWER 60 DEWPOINTS ALREADY IN PLACE ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. NOT EXPECTING ANY RAINFALL THIS MORNING 
AS 700 MB CAPPING INVERSION AND LACK OF A LIFTING MECHANISM WILL 
KEEP MOST IF NOT ALL AREAS DRY UNTIL AFTERNOON. AS A RESULT...WENT 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY FOR BETWEEN 
16-18Z. I/M EXPECTING HIGHS TO BE PRETTY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY WITH 
HIGHS APPROACHING THE LOWER 70S ACROSS A PORTION OF THE AREA AS MOST 
AREAS ARE ALREADY IN THE MIDDLE 60S.

TONIGHT...SEVERAL SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS COMING TOGETHER FOR A 
POTENTIAL EVENT TONIGHT. BUT AS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS...THE BIG 
QUESTION WILL BE INSTABILITY.  ETA/GFS BOTH HAVE BEEN NOTING RATHER 
LOW INSTABILITY WITH CAP IN PLACE DURING THE DAY. 850 MB LOW LEVEL 
JET WILL BEGIN TO MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE THIS AFTERNOON WITH 
FAIRLY DECENT DYNAMICS ON THE BASE OF A 80KT 500 MB JET. A 
SURFACE BASED LIFTED PARCEL CENTERED ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE 
(72/60) ONLY PRODUCES 600 J/KG AT BEST BY LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY 
EVENING.  BEST PROBABLE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS 
FROM A DYNAMIC BOW ECHO WITH NEARLY UNIDIRECTIONAL WINDS IN 850-500 
MB LAYER AND 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS GREATER THAN 10C BEHIND 
FRONT. SURFACE WINDS WILL BACK SLIGHTLY AS CONVECTION BEGINS TO 
TRACK ACROSS ARKANSAS. 0-6KM BULK SHEAR VALUES AROUND 60 KTS...0-1 
KM STORM RELATIVE HELICITIES EXCEEDING 300 M2/S2 AFTER 00Z...AND 
LCL/S BELOW 4KFT SUPPORT THE POSSIBILITY OF A COUPLE OF LOW TOPPED 
SUPERCELL STORMS THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE OVERTAKEN BY SQUALL LINE. 
HEAVY RAINFALL PARAMETERS NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE WITH BOTH K-INDICIES 
STAYING BELOW 35 AND PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WELL BELOW 1.5 
INCHES. WILL HAVE DAY SHIFT TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT SITUATION AFTER 12Z 
MODEL DATA STARTS COMING IN.

THURSDAY...RAINFALL WILL GRADUALLY COME TO AN END BY EARLY AFTERNOON 
ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA AS COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES TO BUILD 
INTO THE MID SOUTH BEHIND COLD FRONT...HIGHS WILL OCCUR EARLY IN THE 
MORNING AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES DROP TO AROUND 4C BY 00Z FRIDAY. THE 
COLD AIR WILL BE LAGGING A BIT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT AND EXPECT 
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY WITH PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE HANGING AROUND. 

THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE IN COVERAGE AS

POTENTIAL EVENT TONIGHT. BUT AS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS...THE BIG 
QUESTION WILL BE INSTABILITY.  ETA/GFS BOTH HAVE BEEN NOTING RATHER 
LOW INSTABILITY WITH CAP IN PLACE DURING THE DAY. 850 MB LOW LEVEL 
JET WILL BEGIN TO MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE THIS AFTERNOON WITH 
FAIRLY DECENT DYNAMICS ON THE BASE OF A 80KT 500 MB JET. A 
SURFACE BASED LIFTED PARCEL CENTERED ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE 
(72/60) ONLY PRODUCES 600 J/KG AT BEST BY LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY 
EVENING.  BEST PROBABLE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS 
FROM A DYNAMIC BOW ECHO WITH NEARLY UNIDIRECTIONAL WINDS IN 850-500 
MB LAYER AND 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS GREATER THAN 10C BEHIND 
FRONT. SURFACE WINDS WILL BACK SLIGHTLY AS CONVECTION BEGINS TO 
TRACK ACROSS ARKANSAS. 0-6KM BULK SHEAR VALUES AROUND 60 KTS...0-1 
KM STORM RELATIVE HELICITIES EXCEEDING 300 M2/S2 AFTER 00Z...AND 
LCL/S BELOW 4KFT SUPPORT THE POSSIBILITY OF A COUPLE OF LOW TOPPED 
SUPERCELL STORMS THAT WOULD EVENTUALLY BE OVERTAKEN BY SQUALL LINE. 
HEAVY RAINFALL PARAMETERS NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE WITH BOTH K-INDICIES 
STAYING BELOW 35 AND PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WELL BELOW 1.5 
INCHES. WILL HAVE DAY SHIFT TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT SITUATION AFTER 12Z 
MODEL DATA STARTS COMING IN.

THURSDAY...RAINFALL WILL GRADUALLY COME TO AN END BY EARLY AFTERNOON 
ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA AS COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES TO BUILD 
INTO THE MID SOUTH BEHIND COLD FRONT...HIGHS WILL OCCUR EARLY IN THE 
MORNING AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES DROP TO AROUND 4C BY 00Z FRIDAY. THE 
COLD AIR WILL BE LAGGING A BIT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT AND EXPECT 
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY WITH PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE HANGING AROUND. 

THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE IN COVERAGE AS 
1000-500MB LAYER RH/S DROP TO AROUND 25 PERCENT BY DAYBREAK. LOW 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE 20S TO LOWER 30S WITH HIGHS 
STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF THE 40S.

NO CHANGES MADE BEYOND FRIDAY.

SEE LITTLE NEED FOR AN UPDATE AT THIS TIME. WILL EVENTUALLY UPDATE
TO DEAL WITH EVENING/OVERNIGHT CLOUD COVER WORDING...BUT REST OF
FORECAST IN LINE AT THIS TIME.
&&

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 327 PM...
STATIONARY FRONT CONTINUES TO BE LOCATED JUST NORTH OF THE
MIDSOUTH...ROUGHLY FROM NORTH TEXAS EAST INTO SOUTHERN OHIO. IN THE
UPPER LEVELS...STRONG SHORTWAVE OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA BEGINNING TO
EJECT EASTWARD. THIS LEAVES THE CWA IN SW FLOW ALOFT.

ALL OF CWA IN WARM SECTOR WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S. WILL NOT BE
MUCH OF A TEMPERATURE DROP TONIGHT AS WARM ADVECTION INCREASES.
ALTHOUGH NO OBVIOUS TRIGGERS FOR PRECIP ARE SEEN TONIGHT WILL LEAVE
20 POPS IN GIVEN THE MOIST AIRMASS AND THE UNSTABLE FLOW ALOFT. SOME
AREAS WILL HAVE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES THIS EVENING BEFORE MORE CIRRUS
COMES IN. HAVE REFLECTED THIS IN FORECAST.

AS UPPER ENERGY DRAWS CLOSER TOMORROW...PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL
TIGHTEN AND WIND FIELDS WILL INCREASE. A WINDY DAY IN STORE FOR
TOMORROW...ENCROACHING UPON WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA. WILL PASS ON
THIS POSSIBILITY TO NEXT SHIFT FOR FURTHER REVIEW. MODEL SOUNDINGS
SHOW A GOOD CAP FOR MOST OF THE DAY...LIMITING THUNDERSTORM
POTENTIAL. COULD STILL SEE A FEW WARM AIR ADVECTION SHOWERS DURING
THE DAY. CIRRUS SHIELD SHOULD LIMIT SUN TOMORROW...BUT ANY BREAKS
WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RISE QUICKLY AND MAY HELP TO LESSEN
STRENGTH OF THE CAP. AT THIS POINT...EXPECT LITTLE ACTION DURING THE
DAYTIME HOURS.

MAIN SHOW COMES INTO THE AREA AFTER 00Z THU. THE AFOREMENTIONED
SHORTWAVE WILL DRIVE A VERY STRONG COLD FRONT TOWARD THE AREA. WIND
FIELDS AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WILL RAPIDLY INCREASE. MODELS IN GOOD
AGREEMENT OF A 60-75KT LOW LEVEL JET...A 80KT MID LEVEL JET...AND A
140KT UPPER JET. SUBSTANTIAL DYNAMIC FORCING ALONG THE FRONT...WITH
THE AREA UNDER THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER JET. EXPECT A
SQUALL LINE TO RAPIDLY ORGANIZE OVER WESTERN AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS
AND QUICKLY ADVANCE EASTWARD. MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT ON TIMING
WITH THE LINE COMING INTO E ARKANSAS 03Z-06Z...ACROSS THE RIVER
AROUND 09Z...AND INTO EASTERN CWA AROUND OR JUST AFTER 12Z.
DEFINITELY A DAMAGING WIND THREAT WITH THIS LINE GIVEN STRONG WIND
FIELDS. ALSO...0-3KM SR HELICITIES GREATER THAN 500 M2/S2 WILL ALLOW
THE POTENTIAL OF EMBEDDED SUPERCELLS WITHIN THE LINE. AS ALWAYS IS
THE CASE THIS TIME OF YEAR...INSTABILITY IS THE QUESTION MARK.
MODELS SHOWING CAPES OF 500-800 J/KG ACROSS THE AREA AND THIS SHOULD
BE ENOUGH FOR THE SEVERE THREAT TO BE REALIZED...ESPECIALLY WITH
STEEPENING MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WITH THE APPROACH OF THE SHORTWAVE.
IF THERE IS MORE SUN THAN FORECAST TOMORROW...THIS WILL ALSO
INCREASE THE INSTABILITY. WILL HIGHLIGHT THREAT IN THE HWO AND
MENTION SEVERE WORDING IN THE ZONES. THIS MATCHES WELL WITH SPC
SLIGHT RISK AREA.

ALL PRECIP SHOULD BE OUT OF THE AREA BY 18Z THURSDAY. COLD ARCTIC
AIR WILL BEGIN TO FILTER INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT. TEMPS LIKELY
TO FALL THROUGH THURSDAY. DO NOT FEEL THE MEX NUMBERS HANDLE THE
ARCTIC AIRMASS WELL AND HAVE UNDERCUT TEMPS THROUGHOUT THE REST OF
THE FORECAST. FORECAST LOOKS DRY THROUGH TUESDAY AND DID NOT MAKE
MANY CHANGES TO EXTENDED AS HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE REGION.

.DISCUSSION...

STATIONARY FRONT STILL LOCATED JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH 
WITH THE ENTIRE AREA UNDER THE WARM SECTOR. DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 
60S AREAWIDE. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE OCCURRED THIS 
MORNING DUE TO A SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE WSW FLOW. THIS 
SHORTWAVE IS NOW EXITING THE REGION AND THE PRECIP IS TAPERING OFF 
AND LEAVING THE CWA. RUC/GFS/META ALL SHOW ANOTHER SMALL SHORTWAVE 
MOVING THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE ATMOSPHERE IS MOIST AND 
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE (CAPES 400-600 J/KG) WILL LEAVE 30 POPS IN FOR 
THE AFTERNOON. 

TEMPS FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. SHOULD SEE A FEW BREAKS IN 
THE CLOUDS...ESPECIALLY OVER EAST ARKANSAS. THIS WILL HELP TEMPS TO 
REACH THEIR FORECASTED VALUES. IF MORE SUN WERE TO BREAK THROUGH 
THEN FORECAST LOWS MAY BE TOO LOW. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR. OTHER 
PARAMETERS ON TRACK. ADJUSTED SHORT TERM SKY GRIDS TO MATCH TRENDS.

.MAIN POINTS OF PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED 350 AM...

TONIGHT...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE EMBEDDED IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
WILL AFFECT THE MID SOUTH EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. EVEN WITH CAPES 
OF 500-600 J/KG...LI/S AROUND -2...AND MODERATE 700-500MB MID LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES AROUND 6.5 C/KM...I THINK MOISTURE MAY BE THE LIMITING 
FACTOR IN ANY DECENT CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND WILL CARRY ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH BEST CHANCES TOWARDS THE MO/KY BORDER. 
LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL DROP BACK INTO THE 50S.

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...LONG AWAITED STRONG COLD FRONT WILL 
BEGIN TO APPROACH THE MID SOUTH. 850 MB LOW LEVEL JET WILL INCREASE 
TO AROUND AN IMPRESSIVE 70 KTS AROUND 03Z THURSDAY AND STRONG 
MID/UPPER LEVEL FORCING /700-500 MB Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE/. FURTHER 
ANALYSIS OF MANY MODIFIED SURFACE AND ELEVATED PARCELS ON MODEL 
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST SUPERCELL THREAT MAY BE LIMITED TO AREAS PRIMARILY 
ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AS MID LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION LIMITS 
INSTABILITY WITH LESS THAN 1000 J/KG TO POINTS NORTH. HOWEVER 0-1KM 
STORM RELATIVE HELICITY VALUES WILL BE MORE THAN ADEQUATE FOR 
POSSIBLE SUPERCELLS /350-400 M2/S2/ ALONG WITH A RATHER DECENT SHEAR 
PROFILE ACROSS MISSISSIPPI. I WOULD ANTICIPATE A FEW SUPERCELLS TO 
DEVELOP ACROSS MISSISSIPPI WITH A DYNAMIC BOW ECHO EVENTUALLY 
OVERTAKING ALL CONVECTION AHEAD OF THIS LINE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA AS WINDS WILL BECOME MORE UNIDIRECTIONAL AND 700 MB DEWPOINT 
DEPRESSIONS WELL OVER 7C. I WILL BE MENTIONING SEVERE THREAT 
POTENTIAL BOTH IN THE ZFP FORECAST ALONG AND THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER 
OUTLOOK.

SURFACE BASED PARCEL OF 71/60/. 88D RADAR RETURNS OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF HOURS HAVE ONLY SHOWED A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS THUS FAR BUT 
THINK SCATTERED POPS ARE JUSTIFIED. A WEAK CAPPING INVERSION WILL BE PRESENT 
THIS AFTERNOON AROUND 650 MB BUT SUSPECT ANY SURFACE BASED PARCEL 
WILL HAVE NO PROBLEM OVERCOMING THE CAP. WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS BELOW 
10KFT ARE FAVORABLE FOR SOME HAIL GROWTH. AS A RESULT WILL KEEP 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR TODAY. TEMPERATURES TODAY 
WILL WARM INTO THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA

.MAIN POINTS OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 345 PM...
A SHORTWAVE WL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION AFTER MIDNIGHT SO EXPECT SOME
SHWRS/TSTMS TO BREAK OUT AFTER MIDNIGHT. TEMPS WL BE MILD WITH
SOUTHERLY SFC FLOW SO TEMPS WILL NOT FALL MUCH...IN FACT TEMPS ACRS
NE AR WL PROBABLY RISE.

FRONT WELL NORTH OF THE AREA ON TUE THROUGH WED. SHORTWAVE EXITS THE

MUCH TO TRIGGER ANYTHING TUE NIGHT SO WL GO WITH LOW POPS. SINCE
AREA SOLIDLY IN THE WARM SECTOR TEMPS WL CONT TO BE MILD WITH
READINGS NEAR 70 TUE AND WED. DEWPOINTS WL CLIMB ABOVE 60 DEGREES.

STRONG SYSTEM WL APPROACH ON WED. ETA AND GFS DIFFER ON TIMING SO WL
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE AT THIS POINT. ETA IS STRONGER AND SLOWER WITH
GFS FASTER AND WEAKER. EITHER WAY FRONT WL SWEEP THROUGH WED NIGHT
AND EARLY THU. SVR POTENTIAL EXISTS WITH THIS FRONT. PLENTY OF SHEAR
WITH STRONG WINDS AT ALL LEVELS. HELICITES ARE QUITE HIGH WITH SOME
ETA SOUNDINGS OVER 1000 M2/S2. LIKE ALWAYS THIS TIME OF YEAR THE
QUESTION IS INSTABILITY. BOTH MODELS HAVE A SOME CAPE AND LIFTED

OKLAHOMA. MAIN SHORT TERM FORECAST CONCERNS FOR TODAY IS FOG 
POTENTIAL THIS MORNING AND RAIN CHANCES FOR TONIGHT.

TODAY...LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS LOW CLOUDS HAVE 
ALREADY SCATTERED OUT ACROSS ARKANSAS WITH SOME MID/HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS CENTRAL ARKANSAS. TEMPERATURES NORTH OF THE

40S/LOWER 50S ACROSS SOUTHWEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. 
AS A RESULT VISIBILITIES HAVE DROPPED DOWN BELOW 1/4 MILE IN SPOTS 
AND HAVE ISSUED A DENSE FOG ADVISORY FOR POINTS MAINLY ALONG AND 
NORTH OF JBR AND WEST OF I-55 THROUGH 10 AM. TEMPERATURES NOT 
EXPECTED TO IMPROVE TOO MUCH FROM YESTERDAY AS SOME RESIDUAL LOW

GO WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES. 

TONIGHT...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL NOT MAKE ANY PROGRESS ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH. SURFACE DEWPOINTS SHOULD BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS THE 
MID SOUTH TO AROUND 60 BY EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. 315K SURFACE SHOWS 
INCREASING ISENTROPIC ASCENT TOWARDS DAYBREAK. 700-500 MB LAYER

FORECAST BECOMING MORE AND MORE TRICKY AS SATELLITE SHOWS THAT THE 
LOW CLOUDS OVER THE AREA ARE MOVING EASTWARD. SO EXPECT SKIES TO 
BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY FOR AT LEAST PART OF THE NIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW 
TEMPS TO BEGIN TO FALL AND WINDS TO BECOME LIGHT RESULTING IN FOG 
FORMATION AND POSSIBLY LOW STRATUS REFORMING TOWARDS DAWN. WILL 
UPDATE THE OVERNIGHT PORTION OF THE FORECAST FOR PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES...LEAVING IN THE AREAS OF FOG. IF SKIES REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY 
LONG ENOUGH A DENSE FOG ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED AROUND DAY BREAK FOR 
VISIBILITIES OF LESS THAN A QUARTER MILE. BUT SUCH AN ADVISORY WOULD 
BE MORE NEEDED FOR THE MORNING THAN OVERNIGHT SO WILL HOLD OFF AN 
ADVISORY AT THIS TIME AND PERMIT NEXT SHIFT TO REEVALUATE. MIN TEMPS 
ARE REASONABLE. UPDATE WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

.DISCUSSION...
CLOUDS HAVE BROKEN UP THIS AFTERNOON ALLOWING FOR SUN TO COME OUT 
OVER THE MIDSOUTH. TEMPERATURES HAVE NOT WARMED UP AS QUICKLY AS 
PREVIOUS THOUGHT. GUIDANCE HAS BEEN TOO WARM OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS 
SO WILL UNDERCUT GUIDANCE ON THIS FORECAST PERIOD DURING AT LEAST 
THE SHORT TERM. 

WEATHER WISE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WITH HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SFC WILL 
PREVAIL THROUGH MONDAY. THIS WILL KEEP THE MIDSOUTH DRY WITH A 
GRADUAL WARMING TREND.

MODELS BEGIN TO DIFFER ON AN APPROACHING SHORTWAVE MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY. THE ETA KEEPS THE SHORTWAVE NORTH OF THE CWA THUS KEEPING 
THE AREA DRY. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE GFS BRINGS THE SHORTWAVE INTO 
THE MIDSOUTH...THUS MAV GUIDANCE IS GIVING RATHER HIGH POPS FOR THE 
AREA. WILL GO WITH A COMPROMISE ACROSS THE CWA. WILL PUT LOW POPS 
ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA AND WILL KEEP THE SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS DRY.

EXPECT CHANCES FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE 
INTO WEDNESDAY AS A STRONG SHORTWAVE AND COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE 
AREA FROM THE WEST. WILL RAISE POPS IN WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA 
FOR WEDNESDAY.  EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BECOME MORE 
NUMEROUS WEDNESDAY EVENING AS THE FRONT PUSHES INTO THE CWA. SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS COULD BE SEVERE LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. INSTABILITY WILL STILL BE A QUESTION. HOWEVER 
DYNAMICS ARE LOOKING VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH A 120 KNOT UPPER LEVEL JET 
AND 60 KNOT LOW LEVEL JET MOVING OVER THE CWA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
HELICITY VALUES WILL ALSO BE AROUND 400 M2/S2. IF THE SUN CAN BREAK 
THROUGH THE CLOUDS WEDNESDAY AND HELP MAKE THE ATMOSPHERE MORE 
UNSTABLE...THIS WILL ONLY HELP MAKE SEVERE STORMS MORE LIKELY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. PRECIP MAY LINGER INTO THURSDAY ACROSS EASTERN 
ZONES.

COLD AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP THROUGHOUT THE DAY ACROSS MUCH OF THE CWA. 
THE COLD AIR WILL STICK AROUND THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS 
ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE MIDSOUTH. HIGH TEMPERATURES 
WILL PROBABLY HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING OUT OF THE 20S ESPECIALLY ON 
SATURDAY.

.DISCUSSION...LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES ABUNDANT 
LOW STRATUS AFFECTING MUCH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. WATER 
VAPOR IMAGERY DEPICTS UPPER LEVEL LOW ACROSS THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST 
AND A STEADY SUPPLY OF PACIFIC MOISTURE TRAVERSING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN UNITED STATES. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING RANGE FROM THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S. MAIN FORECAST 
CONCERNS FOR TODAY WILL BE CLOUD COVER ISSUES AND RESULTANT 
TEMPERATURES. 

TODAY...SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO 
THE REGION TODAY. 00Z RAOB FROM KLZK SHOWS QUITE A BIT OF SUBSIDENCE 
IN MID/UPPER LEVELS BUT STILL SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TRAPPED BELOW 
INVERSION. 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO AROUND 14C WITH HIGHS 
ONLY WARMING INTO THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
SUGGEST SOME STRATOCUMULUS WILL HANG AS WIND FIELDS WILL REMAIN 
RATHER LIGHT MAKING IT DIFFICULT TO MIX OUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. 

TONIGHT...SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL REMAIN IN PLACE 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT. SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL STILL 
REMAIN ACROSS THE AREA AND EXPECT PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE 40S. 

MONDAY...SURFACE RIDGING WILL BEGIN TO SLIDE EAST AS SURFACE LOW 
EJECTS OUT OF THE ROCKIES AND INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
HOWEVER...MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE AND ONLY EXPECTING 
PARTLY SUNNY SKIES AT BEST. HIGHS WILL ONLY BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER 
THAN TODAY.

MONDAY NIGHT...MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE WITH HANDLING OF APPROACHING 
SYSTEM. ETA SEEMS A BIT QUICKER WITH SURFACE LOW THAN PREVIOUS RUN AND GFS 
BRINGS MOISTURE IN AS EARLY AS LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON. 315K SURFACE 
SHOWS ISENTROPIC ASCENT INCREASING...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE EVENING. 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE 
RATES WILL INCREASE TO 6.5 C/KM...LI/S DOWN TO AROUND -2 AND 
SHOWALTER INDICIES DROPPING DOWN AROUND -1. AS A RESULT...WILL LEAN 
TOWARDS GFS SOLUTION AND KEEP AN ISOLATED MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS 
IN ONGOING FORECAST WITH BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION AFTER 
MIDNIGHT.

LATEST MODEL RUNS SUGGEST INSTABILITY WILL STILL BE LACKING FOR ANY 
ORGANIZED SEVERE WEATHER ON WEDNESDAY. NO CHANGES MADE TO TUESDAY 
AND BEYOND.

LOW CLOUDS ARE STILL HANGING ON THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. 
LATEST SATELLITE IMAGES ARE SHOWING SOME EROSION OCCURRING ACROSS 
CENTRAL ARKANSAS AND ACROSS NORTHERN ALABAMA. THIS TREND SHOULD 
CONTINUE INTO THE CWA THIS EVENING. PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS SHOULD 
EXIST BY MIDNIGHT. WITH THE DISSIPATION OF CLOUDS...LIGHT 
WINDS...AND MOISTURE AROUND FROM RECENT RAINS...EXPECT AT LEAST 
PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS.

ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER 
INTO THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL KEEP DRY CONDITIONS 
AROUND THE MIDSOUTH WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES.

SEVERAL SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION DURING MONDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME. THIS WILL BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS 
WITH A FEW POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ABOVE 
NORMAL DURING THIS TIME.

A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT. SOME OF 
THESE STORMS COULD BE STRONG BUT ITS STILL A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO 
TELL. INSTABILITY WILL BE A QUESTION. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY 
OCCUR IN THE MORNING ON THURSDAY AS COLD AIR FILTERS INTO THE REGION 
BEHIND THE FRONT. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND KEEPING THE 
COLD ARCTIC AIR AROUND THE CWA. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY BE IN 
THE 20S BY SATURDAY.

THE MID SOUTH IS IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT WHICH MOVED THROUGH 
THE REGION YESTERDAY. LOW CLOUDS ARE SPREAD ACROSS THE WHOLE 
FORECAST AREA WITH SOME AREAS OF FOG AND DRIZZLE. THE CLOUDS WILL BE 
SLOW TO CLEAR THIS MORNING AND WILL LIKELY HOLD IN FOR MUCH OF THE 
DAYLIGHT HOURS. THE ONLY EXCEPTION WILL BE THE WESTERN HALF OF THE 
MID SOUTH. FORECAST SOUNDINGS PICK UP ON THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND 
ARE SLOW TO CLEAR IT. THE CLOUD FORECAST FOR TODAY WILL BE THE MAIN 
CHALLENGE WITH DAYTIME HIGHS DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER. 

THE UPPER PATTERN OVER THE SOUTHERN CONUS BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL WHICH 
SHOULD AID IN DRYING OUT THE SATURATED GROUND THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL OCCUR MONDAY WHEN A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES THE REGION FROM THE NORTH. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. 

ANOTHER ARCTIC COLD FRONT WILL BLAST INTO THE AREA THURSDAY. 
EXPECTING DROPPING TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE DAY THURSDAY. ANY 
PRECIPITATION THAT DEVELOPS ON THURSDAY MAY BECOME SLEET/FREEZING 
RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHWESTERN FORECAST AREA. AT THIS TIME...THE SPEED 
OF THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE EAST OF THE AREA BY THURSDAY EVENING. 
JUST SOMETHING TO WATCH OVER THE NEXT FEW MODEL RUNS. THE COLDEST 
MORNING WILL LIKELY BE NEXT SATURDAY.

AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS STATES THIS
AFTERNOON WILL RAPIDLY MOVE ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT AND
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY SATURDAY MORNING. THIS WILL ALLOW A
BAROCLINIC ZONE STRETCHED ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES THIS AFTERNOON
TO SURGE NORTHWARD THIS EVENING AS A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
DEVELOPS ALONG THE FRONT AND MOVES NORTHEAST.

.TONIGHT...

AS THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH MOVES
EAST...ABUNDANT MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO SURGE NORTHWARD INTO THE
FORECAST AREA. THIS MEANS A CONTINUATION OF THE RAIN THROUGH THE
EVENING HOURS. THERE WILL EVEN BE CHANCES FOR A FEW THUNDERSTORMS
OVER SOUTHEAST PORTIONS OF THE CWA (NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI...
SOUTHERN WEST TENNESSEE NEAR THE TENNESSEE RIVER). THE RAIN WILL
TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT.
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN SEASONABLY COLD OVER THE NORTHERN 2/3RDS
OF THE AREA...WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES THIS EVENING OVER THE
SOUTHEAST 1/3RD OF THE FORECAST AREA AS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES
NORTH OF THESE AREAS. AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEPARTS LATER
TONIGHT EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO SLOWLY FALL...EVEN ACROSS NORTHEAST
MISSISSIPPI. NOT EXPECTING ANY PROBLEMS WITH FROZEN OR FREEZING
PRECIPITATION TONIGHT ACROSS THE NORTH...AS PRECIPITATION SHOULD
COME TO AN END BEFORE TEMPERATURES FALL TO NEAR OR JUST BELOW THE
FREEZING MARK.

.SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...
ONCE THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES TO THE EAST...HIGH PRESSURE WILL
BUILD IN BOTH AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A
RETURN TO DRY WEATHER INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK. HIGH
PRESSURE WILL MOVE OVER THE MID SOUTH ON SATURDAY...THEN MOVE OFF TO
OUR EAST FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WINDS WILL REMAIN LIGHT OUT OF THE
NORTH AND NORTHEAST ON SATURDAY. THIS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE
UPPER 40S NORTH TO LOW 50S SOUTH. AS THE HIGH PRESSURE SLIPS EAST...
WINDS WILL RETURN FROM THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST WITH APPRECIABLE
LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION SETTING UP. THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO
TO WARM 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE SATURDAYS HIGHS. CONTINUED WELL
ABOVE AVERAGE TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE INTO THE FIRST PART OF
NEXT WEEK.

.MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE TOWARDS THE MID SOUTH FROM THE NORTHWEST
ON MONDAY AND STALL ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA
MONDAY NIGHT. WITH A WARM AND INCREASINGLY MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE...
ALONG WITH CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT...HAVE ADDED A CHANCE FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY NIGHT. ON
TUESDAY THIS FRONT WILL LIFT BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT AS A
POTENT SHORTWAVE TROUGH DIGS ACROSS THE WESTERN UNITED STATES. THIS
WILL PUT MOST OF THE AREA WELL ENTRENCHED INTO THE WARM SECTOR.
HAVE PULLED BACK THE POPS FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AS THE
FRONT LIFTS BACK TO THE NORTH AND LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ANY DISTINCT
FORCING MECHANISM NOTED. HAVE STILL INCLUDED 20 POPS AREAWIDE FOR
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AS ANY WEAK UPPER DISTURBANCE IN THE
INCREASINGLY SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT COULD TRIGGER ISOLATED
CONVECTION.

THE STRONGER SHORTWAVE OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. WILL EJECT OUT ACROSS
THE PLAINS STATES BY WEDNESDAY. AS THIS SYSTEM PULLS EAST...IT WILL
HELP TO SEND A STRONG COLD FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY
NIGHT AND THURSDAY. AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...EXPECT BETTER CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THERE SHOULD BE STRONG JET DYNAMICS
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT...SO WILL NEED TO MONITOR FOR POSSIBLE
SEVERE. STILL WAY TOO EARLY THOUGH TO PINPOINT ANY SPECIFICS. THIS
STRONG SHORTWAVE WILL ALSO HELP TO DIG OUT A DEEP TROPOSPHERIC
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. FOR THE END OF THE WEEK...SO
ANTICIPATING MUCH COLDER WEATHER FOR LATER ON THURSDAY INTO NEXT
WEEKEND.

PRECIPITATION HAS BECOME FOCUSED ALONG AND NORTH OF A SURFACE
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE THAT IS STRETCHED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.
TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO RISE AREAWIDE...WITH ONLY EXTREME NORTHERN

MODELS HAVE DONE A POOR JOB OF INITIALIZATION OVER THE MID SOUTH 
TONIGHT. NONE OF THEM PICKED UP ON THE ONGOING PRECIP WHICH OCCURRED 
WELL BEFORE MIDNIGHT. 

SURFACE TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
ARE NEAR 32 DEGREES OR HIGHER. THIS IS WHERE THE BULK OF THE RAIN IS 
LOCATED. THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA IS AT 32 DEGREES OR 
LESS WHICH WILL POSE A CHALLENGING FORECAST FOR THE NEXT 6 TO 8 
HOURS. KMEM REPORTED LIGHT SLEET 20 PAST 2 THIS MORNING...THEN 
REPORTED THE CHANGEOVER BACK TO RAIN ABOUT 6 MINUTES LATER. LOOKING 
AT AREA SOUNDINGS...THE DEPTH OF THE BELOW FREEZING AIR IS ONLY 
ABOUT 2 KFT...AND ABOVE 2 KFT THERE IS A SIGNIFICANT WARM LAYER. WE 
ARE EXPECTING SURFACE TEMPERATURES TO SLOWLY RISE THE REMAINDER OF 
THE MORNING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. 

SOME AREAS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH...MAINLY TENNESSEE...THE MISSOURI 
BOOTHEEL AND NORTHEAST ARKANSAS MAY EXPERIENCE LIGHT FREEZING RAIN  
FOR A BRIEF TIME BEFORE THE PRECIPITATION TURNS TO ALL RAIN. WE DO 
NOT ANTICIPATE ANY PROBLEMS RELATED TO THE SLEET SINCE IT WILL OCCUR 
FOR LESS THAN 30 MINUTES IN ANY PARTICULAR AREA AND BE RATHER LIGHT. 
WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS FOR ANY UNEXPECTED CHANGES.

BY MID MORNING ALL AREAS WILL EXPERIENCE RAIN WHICH WILL CONTINUE 
INTO TONIGHT. THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH RESPONSIBLE FOR THE RAIN TODAY 
WILL TRANSLATE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT. MOST OF THE RAIN WILL 
MOVE EAST...LINGERING AROUND THE SOUTHEAST FORECAST AREA SATURDAY 
MORNING. DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED FOR MOST AREAS THROUGH THE DAYTIME 
HOURS MONDAY. 

MORE UNSETTLED WEATHER IS EXPECTED IN THE FORM OF SHOWERS AND

DRY AND COLD WEATHER CAN BE EXPECTED UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH
PRESSURE TONIGHT. THE HIGH WILL SLIDE EASTWARD FRIDAY AS A LOW
DEVELOPS OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. SOUTHERLY FLOW AROUND THE HIGH WILL

MAIN PIECE OF WESTERN TROF LIFTS OVER THE RIDGE WEDNESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...FINALLY DRAGGING COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA.
WILL BE ANOTHER CONCENTRATED ROUND OF PRECIPITATION (AND A LITTLE
BETTER CHANCE OF THUNDER) WITH THIS FRONT...BUT RAIN SHOULD BE OUT OF
OUR AREA EARLY THURSDAY MORNING.

THROUGH THE DAYTIME HOURS WEDNESDAY...PERSISTANCE SEEMS THE WAY TO
GO ON TEMPERATURES. CURRENT FORECAST HAS THIS DEPICTED PRETTY WELL.
HIGHS THURSDAY COULD BE RATHER EARLY IN THE DAY...DEPENDING ON
ACTUAL TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE. EVEN THIS COOLING WILL ONLY RETURN
US TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS.
&&

.LONG TERM (AFTER THURSDAY)...
A DRY PERIOD BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. WITH
FRONT FORECAST TO STALL ALONG GULF COAST...WE WILL HAVE TO WATCH
FOR A WAVE TO MOVE ALONG THE FRONT FRIDAY. THIS COULD BRING
PRECIPITATION BACK INTO NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI...BUT FOR NOW WILL
KEEP FORECAST DRY.

SURFACE HIGH MOVES OFF TO THE EAST ON SATURDAY...SURFACE FLOW
BECOMES SOUTHERLY AGAIN...WITH UPPER FLOW SOUTHWEST. PRETTY MUCH
THE SAME PATTERN WE ARE IN NOW. MAY BE SOME WARM ADVECTION SHOWERS
AS WARMTH RETURNS SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP
SUNDAY/MONDAY DRY FOR NOW...BUT WOULD NOT BE SHOCKED IF PRECIP NEEDS
TO BE ADDED LATER.

TEMPERATURES...FRIDAY WILL STILL SEE TEMPS AROUND NORMAL BEFORE HIGH
MOVES OFF TO THE EAST. AFTER THAT...WE RETURN TO WARMER THAN NORMAL
TEMPERATURES. HIGH TEMPERATURE FORECAST FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY
MAY EVEN BE A HAIR ON THE CONSERVATIVE SIDE. H85 TEMPS AROUND +10
AND THICKNESSES AROUND 5600 FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS EVENING PLACES LOW 
PRESSURE ACROSS THE PANHANDLE OF OKLAHOMA. MEANWHILE...A WARM FRONT 
EXTENDS FROM THE LOW INTO NORTHERN MISSOURI AND CENTRAL ILLINOIS. 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS QUITE A BIT OF MOISTURE ACROSS THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS FOR OVERNIGHT WILL 
BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES. 

00Z UPPER AIR ANALYSES SHOW MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE MID LEVELS WILL 
BEGIN TO SLOWLY TRY TO DRY OUT OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...I THINK DRIER 
PERIOD WILL BEGIN CLOSER TO DAYBREAK AND LAST THROUGH THE MORNING AS 
SHORTWAVE MOVES TO THE NORTHEAST AND BEFORE THE NEXT WAVE /LOCATED 
OVER THE BAJA OF CALIFORNIA/ EJECTS INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MID 
SOUTH SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. THAT SAID...WILL NOT MAKE ANY 
MODIFICATIONS TO POPS FOR OVERNIGHT BUT WILL LOWER POPS FOR SUNDAY 
MORNING. MINOR MODIFICATIONS WILL BE MADE TO OVERNIGHT LOWS BASED 
UPON CURRENT TRENDS WITH AMPLE CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH TUESDAY)...
UPPER RIDGE REMAINS IN PLACE WITH SHORTWAVES EJECTING OUT OF
SOUTHWEST UPPER LOW OVER TOP OF THE RIDGE. THIS WILL PRODUCE
OCCASIONAL BOUTS OF SHOWERS...AND POSSIBLY THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH 
TUESDAY. 

MOST CONCENTRATED CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION IN SHORT TERM LIKELY TO BE
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY...MAINLY NORTHWEST. SHORTWAVE MOVING
THROUGH THEN IS A LITTLE MORE VIGOROUS THAN THE CURRENT ONE. LARGE
DIFFERENCE IN QPF BETWEEN ETA AND GFS FOR NORTHWEST HALF OF CWA
THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY. GFS HAS A MAX OF OVER 6 INCHES...MUCH OF IT
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. ETA SHOWS A MAX OF AROUND 2 INCHES. GFS
LOOKS OVERDONE FOR NOW...BUT THIS SYSTEM WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED.

NO LARGE SWINGS IN TEMPERATURES THROUGH TUESDAY. HIGHS MAINLY IN
THE 60S AND LOWS IN THE 50S.

.LONG TERM (POST-TUESDAY)...
FRONTAL PASSAGE APPEARS TO BE SOMETIME ON WEDNESDAY...ALTHOUGH IT
APPEARS TO BE A HAIR SLOWER THAN YESTERDAY. IF THERE IS A DRY DAY...
IT WILL BE THURSDAY. COOLER THAT DAY...THEN AS HIGH MOVES OFF TO

BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES. 

00Z UPPER AIR ANALYSES SHOW MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE MID LEVELS WILL 
BEGIN TO SLOWLY TRY TO DRY OUT OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...I THINK DRIER 
PERIOD WILL BEGIN CLOSER TO DAYBREAK AND LAST THROUGH THE MORNING AS 
SHORTWAVE MOVES TO THE NORTHEAST AND BEFORE THE NEXT WAVE /LOCATED 
OVER THE BAJA OF CALIFORNIA/ EJECTS INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MID 
SOUTH SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. THAT SAID...WILL NOT MAKE ANY 
MODIFICATIONS TO POPS FOR OVERNIGHT BUT WILL LOWER POPS FOR SUNDAY 
MORNING. MINOR MODIFICATIONS WILL BE MADE TO OVERNIGHT LOWS BASED 
UPON CURRENT TRENDS WITH AMPLE CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 207 PM CST SAT JAN 1 2005...

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH TUESDAY)...
UPPER RIDGE REMAINS IN PLACE WITH SHORTWAVES EJECTING OUT OF
SOUTHWEST UPPER LOW OVER TOP OF THE RIDGE. THIS WILL PRODUCE
OCCASIONAL BOUTS OF SHOWERS...AND POSSIBLY THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH 
TUESDAY. 

MOST CONCENTRATED CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION IN SHORT TERM LIKELY TO BE
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY...MAINLY NORTHWEST. SHORTWAVE MOVING
THROUGH THEN IS A LITTLE MORE VIGOROUS THAN THE CURRENT ONE. LARGE
DIFFERENCE IN QPF BETWEEN ETA AND GFS FOR NORTHWEST HALF OF CWA
THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY. GFS HAS A MAX OF OVER 6 INCHES...MUCH OF IT
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. ETA SHOWS A MAX OF AROUND 2 INCHES. GFS
LOOKS OVERDONE FOR NOW...BUT THIS SYSTEM WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED.

NO LARGE SWINGS IN TEMPERATURES THROUGH TUESDAY. HIGHS MAINLY IN
THE 60S AND LOWS IN THE 50S.
&&

.LONG TERM (POST-TUESDAY)...
FRONTAL PASSAGE APPEARS TO BE SOMETIME ON WEDNESDAY...ALTHOUGH IT
APPEARS TO BE A HAIR SLOWER THAN YESTERDAY. IF THERE IS A DRY DAY...
IT WILL BE THURSDAY. COOLER THAT DAY...THEN AS HIGH MOVES OFF TO
THE EAST...MOIST AND MILDER AIR WILL RETURN NORTHWARD WITH
TEMPERATURES RETURNING TO ABOVE NORMAL LEVELS NEXT WEEKEND.
