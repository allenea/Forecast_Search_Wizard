856 PM CST FRI DEC 31 2004

.DISCUSSION...LATEST WSR-88D RADAR TRENDS FROM ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH 
SHOW MAINLY ISOLATED LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS AFFECTING THE EASTERN HALF 
OF ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL. 500 MB UPPER AIR ANALYSIS PLACES A 
WEAK SHORTWAVE ACROSS MISSISSIPPI AND PORTIONS OF WESTERN 
TENNESSEE/EASTERN ARKANSAS WITH 850 MB MOISTURE TONGUE TRYING TO 
RIDE UP THE BACK SIDE OF THE RIDGE. 00Z RAOB FROM KLZK SHOWS A WEAK 
CAPPING INVERSION AROUND 700 MB...WHICH HAS SINCE DISSIPATED. STILL 
THINK BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE ACROSS AREAS WEST OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI WHERE WEAK 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES AROUND 6 C/KM 
AND WEAK 700-500 MB Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE RESIDES. AS A RESULT...I/LL 
RAISE POPS UP TO SCATTERED ACROSS A PORTION OF NORTHEAST ARKANSAS 
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND THE FAR TIP OF NW TENNESSEE. 
ELSEWHERE...EXPECT ONLY SPRINKLES OR AN ISOLATED RAIN SHOWER AT 
BEST. LOW TEMPERATURES OVERNIGHT WILL BE SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT/S 
TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM THE MIDDLE 50S TO AROUND 60. WILL KEEP 
SKIES OVERNIGHT AS MOSTLY CLOUDY AS LOW/MID LEVEL MOISTURE WILL HANG 
AROUND THE MID SOUTH.

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 225 PM CST FRI DEC 31 2004...

ANY ORGANIZED LIFT...ISENTROPIC OR OTHERWISE...APPEARS TO STAY
TO OUR NORTH AND WEST DURING THE SHORT TERM. ETA SEEMS TO BE TOO
AGGRESSIVE MOVING COLD FRONT INTO NORTHERN SECTIONS OF CWA. GFS
ALSO APPEARS TO BE HAVING A FEW ISSUES WITH POSSIBLE FEEDBACK.
SURFACE PATTERN WILL BE BASED ON GFS SOLUTION...BUT WILL NOT BUY
MAV POPS.

BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION WOULD BE SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...AS
STRONG SHORTWAVE PASSES TO THE NORTH OF US. NO SIGNIFICANT LIFT
TONIGHT...BUT WITH SHOWERS/SPRINKLES TO OUR SOUTHWEST...WILL KEEP
MENTION OF ISOLATED SHOWERS IN FORECAST. AFTER THAT...40-50 POPS FOR
THE REMAINDER OF THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.

LITTLE CHANGE IN MAX/MIN TEMPS FOR FIRST 36 HOURS. A LITTLE COOLER
SUNDAY WITH MORE CLOUDS. BACK TO LEVELS NEAR TODAY AND SATURDAY FOR
MONDAY.

GOOD CHUNK OF UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST PASSES TO OUR NORTHWEST 
ON WEDNESDAY...BUT WILL PROBABLY BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO DRAG THE COLD 
FRONT THROUGH...TEMPORARILY. CONFIDENCE IN TIMING IS LOW...WILL HOLD 
CHANCE POPS IN FORECAST. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY. 12Z RUN OF GFS SEEMS TO INDICATE ONLY A GLANCING BLOW OF 
COLDER AIR...CERTAINLY NOTHING LIKE LAST WEEK. AT THAT...PROBABLY 
NOT MUCH...IF ANY BELOW NORMAL. WILL DRY OUT FORECAST FOR THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES. EXPECT A RECOVERY IN 
TEMPERATURES NEXT WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...

A WARM AND NON WINTER-LIKE PATTERN CONTINUES ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. 
DEEP TROUGH STILL LOCATED JUST OFF OF THE WESTERN U.S. COAST WITH A 
RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND A SHORTWAVE MOVING UP AND OVER THE 
RIDGE ACROSS THE FAR NORTHERN U.S. THIS HAS PUT THE MIDSOUTH IN A SW 
FLOW WHICH HAS ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB 15 TO 20 DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL. THESE VALUES WILL LIKELY CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS 
AND 2004 WILL GO OUT VERY WARM.

A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING OVERNIGHT AS A SUBTLE 
SHORTWAVE MOVES OVER US. AFTER THIS WAVE PASSES...DONT SEE MUCH IN 
THE WAY OF LIFT FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. WILL LEAVE 20 POPS IN GIVEN 
ANY SMALL DISTURBANCE WILL BE CAPABLE OF TRIGGERING A SHOWER. WENT 
ABOVE MAV GUIDANCE ON HIGHS TODAY. SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY...BUT 
SOME THIN SPOTS OR HOLES MAY DEVELOP WHICH WILL ENCOURAGE TEMPS TO 
CLIMB. LACK OF CLOUDS CURRENTLY NOTED OVER SOUTHERN OK AND CENTRAL 
TX. MODELS SHOW MOISTURE HANGS TOUGH OVER US...BUT WILL HAVE TO 
MONITOR CLOSELY. IF SKIES WERE TO GO PARTLY CLOUDY...FORECAST WILL 
PROBABLY BE TOO LOW FOR MAX TEMPS.

RAIN CHANCES WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY AS A 
SERIES OF SHORTWAVES EJECT OUT OF THE SW AND HELP TO PUSH A COLD 
FRONT CLOSE TO THE REGION. BEST CHANCE OF RAIN APPEARS TO BE ON 
SUNDAY THEREFORE KEPT LIKELY POPS. 100KT UPPER JET TRAVERSING THE 
REGION WILL PROVIDE GOOD DYNAMICS. MODELS INDICATE ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY TO KEEP MENTION OF THUNDER IN THE FORECAST. THE MODELS 
TEND TO DIVERGE BEGINNING SUNDAY NIGHT. THE BIG QUESTION IS HOW FAR 
SOUTH DOES THE FRONT GET? ETA THE BOLD MODEL OF THE DAY BRING THE 
FRONT NEAR OR THROUGH MEMPHIS BY MONDAY MORNING. GFS IS FARTHER 
NORTH THAN THE ETA AND THE ECMWF IS FARTHER NORTH WITH THE FRONT 
THAN ALL OF THE MODELS. THE REASON FOR THE DIFFERENCES APPEARS TO BE 
THAT THE MODELS ALL HANDLE THE SHALLOW ARCTIC AIRMASS OVER THE 
NORTHERN U.S. DIFFERENTLY. GIVEN SUCH STRONG RIDGING OVER OUR 
AREA...WILL LEAN TOWARD THE GFS/ECMWF. THIS WILL RESULT IN CONTINUED 
RAIN CHANCES ON MONDAY. THE FRONT WILL BEGIN TO LIFT BACK NORTH AS A 
WARM FRONT ON TUESDAY IN RESPONSE TO CYCLOGENESIS ON THE LEE SIDE OF 
THE ROCKIES. THIS MAY PROVIDE A BREAK IN THE RAIN...BUT WILL LEAVE 
CHANCE POPS IN.

A MUCH STRONGER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...WHICH WILL FINALLY PUSH A COLD FRONT THROUGH 
THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY. THERE WILL BE A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE FRONT. IF THE GFS IS CORRECT WITH THE 
STRENGTH OF THE LOW...THEN A FEW STORMS MAY BE STRONG GIVEN AMPLE 
MOISTURE AND STRONG WIND FIELDS. PLENTY OF TIME TO EVALUATE. 
COOLER...MORE SEASONABLE AIR WILL FILTER IN BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE 
END OF THE WEEK.

THIS WILL KEEP UNSEASONABLY WARM MOIST CONDITIONS INTO EARLY NEXT

.DISCUSSION...

WHAT A DIFFERENCE A WEEK MAKES THIS TIME LAST WEEK A SIGNIFICANT 
WINTER STORM WAS JUST ENDING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. NOW...WE HAVE A 
COMPLETE PATTERN SHIFT WITH A DEEP WEST COAST TROUGH AND A SOUTHEAST 
RIDGE BRINGING MUCH WARMER TEMPERATURES TO THE AREA AND MAKING THE 
SNOW AND ICE SEEM LIKE A DISTANT MEMORY.

THE MIDSOUTH IS NOW UNDER A WARM AIR ADVECTION REGIME WITH SOUTHERLY 
WINDS AT THE SURFACE DUE TO A SFC RIDGE OFF THE SE COAST AND 
SOUTHWEST FLOW IN THE UPPER LEVELS. THE MAIN FORECAST CHALLENGES 
WILL BE THE TIMING AND CHANCES OF RAIN FOR THE REGION. 

SEVERAL SHORTWAVES WILL EJECT OUT OF THE WEST COAST TROUGH OVER THE 
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY WILL BE DEFLECTED WELL TO 
THE NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH DUE TO THE STRONG RIDGE OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST. AS A RESULT...VERY LITTLE DYNAMIC LIFT PRESENT OVER THE 
CWA TO RESULT IN MUCH RAINFALL. THEREFORE...HAVE TAPERED POPS BACK 
FOR TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY. SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS WILL SUFFICE 
FOR NW HALF OF CWA SINCE THEY WILL BE LOCATED CLOSER TO THE BETTER 
DYNAMICS. A STRONGER SHORTWAVE WILL EJECT OUT SATURDAY INTO 
SUNDAY...PUSHING A COLD FRONT CLOSER TO THE REGION. BEST CHANCE OF 
RAIN LOOKS TO BE SUNDAY WHERE THERE WILL BE HIGH CHANCE POPS. WILL 
MENTION A CHANCE OF THUNDER ON SUNDAY AS MODELS SHOWING SOME SMALL 
INSTABILITY PRESENT BY THAT TIME. TEMPS ABOVE AVERAGE THROUGHOUT 
WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...SE RIDGE HOLDS STRONG AND THE FRONT 
WILL LIKELY MIGRATE BACK TO THE NORTH KEEPING THE MIDSOUTH IN THE 
WARM SECTOR. DGEX ADVERTISES THE FRONT BRIEFLY CLEARING THE REGION 
TO THE SOUTH...BUT WITH SW FLOW ALOFT HAVE A HARD TIME BUYING THAT. 
HAVE BUMPED UP TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS FOR THIS TIME FRAME GIVEN THE 
FRONT SHOULD BE TO THE NORTH. AS ALWAYS WITH SW FLOW...TOUGH TO TIME 
SHORTWAVES WHICH WOULD BRING RAIN CHANCES TO THE REGION. INSTEAD OF 
TRYING TO BE TOO PRECISE...WHICH IS FUTILE THIS FAR OUT...WILL LEAVE 
CHANCE POPS IN. APPEARS THE FRONT WILL FINALLY PUSH THROUGH SOMETIME 
ON WEDNESDAY AS THE MAIN TROUGH OVER THE WEST EJECTS INTO THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS WILL BRING A RETURN TO SEASONABLE TEMPS BY 
THURSDAY.

RAIN LOOKS TO BE SUNDAY WHERE THERE WILL BE HIGH CHANCE POPS. WILL 
MENTION A CHANCE OF THUNDER ON SUNDAY AS MODELS SHOWING SOME SMALL 
INSTABILITY PRESENT BY THAT TIME. TEMPS ABOVE AVERAGE THROUGHOUT 
WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...SE RIDGE HOLDS STRONG AND THE FRONT 
WILL LIKELY MIGRATE BACK TO THE NORTH KEEPING THE MIDSOUTH IN THE 
WARM SECTOR. DGEX ADVERTISES THE FRONT BRIEFLY CLEARING THE REGION 
TO THE SOUTH...BUT WITH SW FLOW ALOFT HAVE A HARD TIME BUYING THAT. 
HAVE BUMPED UP TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS FOR THIS TIME FRAME GIVEN THE 
FRONT SHOULD BE TO THE NORTH. AS ALWAYS WITH SW FLOW...TOUGH TO TIME 
SHORTWAVES WHICH WOULD BRING RAIN CHANCES TO THE REGION. INSTEAD OF 
TRYING TO BE TOO PRECISE...WHICH IS FUTILE THIS FAR OUT...WILL LEAVE 
CHANCE POPS IN. APPEARS THE FRONT WILL FINALLY PUSH THROUGH SOMETIME 
ON WEDNESDAY AS THE MAIN TROUGH OVER THE WEST EJECTS INTO THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS WILL BRING A RETURN TO SEASONABLE TEMPS BY 
THURSDAY.

SOME QUESTION AS TO WHETHER COLDER AIR WILL PENETRATE BACK INTO THE
AREA AT THE END OF THE FORECAST. WILL NOT MAKE MAJOR ADJUSTEMENTS
AT THIS POINT. MODELS HINTING AT BLOCKING PATTERN OVER PACIFIC
INTO THE ALEUTIANS. THIS WOULD KEEP STORM TRACK GENERALLY NORTH

CLEAR SKIES...CALM WINDS...AND EXISTING SNOW/ICE PACK ACROSS AREAS 
OF THE MIDSOUTH WILL ALLOW FOR OPTIMAL RADITIONAL COOLING TONIGHT.  
TONIGHT WILL BE THE COLDEST SO FAR THIS SEASON. THIS COULD BE THE 
2ND COLDEST CHRISTMAS IN JACKSON...JONESBORO AND TUPELO ON RECORD.
THIS COULD BE THE THE 3RD COLDEST CHRISTMAS ON RECORD IN MEMPHIS. 
HAVE LOWERED OVERNIGHT LOWS OVER NE ARKANSAS...THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL 
AND EXTREME NW TENNESSE TO REFLECT SUB-ZERO TEMPERTURES.  MOST AREAS 
SOUTH OF THE AFOREMENTIONED AREA WILL SEE LOWS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS 
TO THE TEENS. BRRR THE REINDEER WILL FEEL THERE STILL ON THE NORTH 
POLE. WILL HIGHLIGHT COLD MINIMUMS WITH SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT.

SFC RIDGE WILL SLOWLY TRANSITION TO THE NORTH AND EAST DURING THIS 
HOLIDAY WEEKEND...ALLOWING FOR TINY INCREMENTS OF MODERATING 
TEMPERATURES. EXPECT THAT SOME LOCATIONS IN MISSISSIPPI WILL RISE 
ABOVE FREEZING BY CHRISTMAS AFTERNOON...WITH ALL HIGH TEMPS 
EXCEEDING 32 F BY SUNDAY...WHERE OPERATION THAW COMMENCES.

THE GULF RETURN FLOW WILL REMAIN OBSOLETE THROUGH MID WEEK WITH 
SW-NE ORIENTED RIDGING ALONG THE MID ATLANTIC COAST.  

BOTH THE GFS AND DGEX KEEP STRONG UPPER LOW OFF THE SOUTHERN 
CALIFORNIA COAST MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. A SHORT WAVE TROF  
FINALLY EJECTS OUT INTO THE DESERT SOUTHWEST BY THURSDAY MORNING 
WITH LEE SIDE CYCLOGENESIS COMMENCING BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THIS 
FINALLY OPENS OUR AREA UP TO THE GULF AND WARMING TREND CONTINUING 
INTO THE END OF THE WEEK. BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE RECOVERY REALLY 
DOES NOT START UNTIL WEEKS END WHERE EXTENDED GUIDANCE BEGINS TO 
PAINT PRECIPITATION BACK INTO THE REGION. ACCORINDING TO THE 
GFS...DEWPOINTS RECOVER MARKEDLY INTO THE 60S BY NEXT WEEKEND WITH A 
100 KT SUBTROPICAL JET MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE REGION ON NEW YEARS

.DISCUSSION...
DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO UPDATE THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME. COLD 
FRONT BISECTS THE MIDSOUTH NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST FROM ABOUT PARIS 
TN TO STUGGART AR. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO SAG SOUTHEASTWARD 
OVERNIGHT. BAND OF WIDESPREAD RAIN OCCURRING ALONG AND BEHIND THE 
FRONT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO SPREAD SOUTHEASTWARD OVERNIGHT WITH THE 
FRONT. FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET IS STILL POSSIBLE LATER TONIGHT FROM 
PARTS OF NORTHEAST AR INTO THE MO BOOTHEEL AS THE COLDER AIR SPREADS 
IN. WILL LEAVE PRESENT WINTER STORMS WARNINGS AND WATCHES AS IS. 

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LIGHTNING STRIKES EARLIER THIS EVENING IN 
EASTERN AR...BUT THESE HAVE DIMINISHED. THE MESOETA DID INDICATE 
DECREASING CAPE THROUGH THIS AREA OVERNIGHT...SO DO NOT EXPECT 
ANYMORE THAN ISOLATED THUNDER AT BEST. 

18Z GFS/MESOETA SEEM DO BE COMING TOGETHER LITTLE BETTER THAN 
PREVIOUS RUNS CONCERNING CONTINUED WINTER WEATHER THREAT WEDNESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BOTH MODELS INDICATED A SURFACE LOW MOVING FROM 
SOUTHWEST MS AT 00Z THU TO NORTHERN AL BY 06Z THU. THE GFS WAS A 
LITTLE STRONGER WITH THE LOW AND A LITTLE WARMER.  
NEVERTHELESS...BOTH MODELS INDICATED COULD BE SIGNIFICANT ICING IN A 
BAND FROM AROUND MEMPHIS TO PARIS WITH HEAVY SNOW TO THE NORTHWEST 
FROM PARTS OF NORTHEAST AR INTO THE MO BOOTHEEL. IF 00Z MODELS 
CONTINUE THIS TREND...CONFIDENCE WILL INCREASE AND WINTER WEATHER 
WATCHES WILL LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO WARNINGS AND POSSIBLY EXTENDED IN 
AREA IN THE WED 4 AM PACKAGE. THE OUTLIER IS THE NGM WHICH SHOWS A 
WARMER SCENARIO WITH LESS WINTRY PRECIPITATION.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 259 PM CST TUE DEC 21 2004

...WINTER STORM FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...

A LINE OF RAIN SHOWERS DEVELOPED LATE THIS MORNING OVER WEST 
TENNESSEE AND HAS BEEN MOVING SLOWLY NORTH. THIS BAND OF RAIN WILL 
SPREAD ACROSS MOST OF THE MID SOUTH THIS EVENING. ADDITIONAL LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND 
PROVIDE PLENTY OF FUEL...FOR THE RAIN WHICH MAY BE HEAVY AT TIMES 
AND LATER...THE FROZEN PRECIPITATION. 

AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT IS WHEN THE FREEZING LINE APPROACHES/ENTERS  
THE NORTHWEST FORECAST AREA. THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO A SHORTWAVE 
SWINGING ACROSS WISCONSIN. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILES...MAINLY ABOUT 
3KFT ABOVE THE GROUND...ON MODEL SOUNDINGS ACROSS THE REGION 
INDICATE A MUCH WARMER AIR COLUMN THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. THIS BRINGS IN 
THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN THE CHANGEOVER TO SNOW WILL OCCUR. IT 
APPEARS THAT SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT...RAIN WILL BEGIN TO MIX WITH 
SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. BY 4 AM...THE 
FREEZING LINE SHOULD PUSH THROUGH THE MO BOOTHEEL AND CAUSE THE 
SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN TO OCCUR. IT APPEARS THAT THE CHANGEOVER TO 
SNOW WILL OCCUR ACROSS THESE AREAS FIRST. WE ARE THINKING THAT WE 
WILL HAVE ALL SNOW BY 10 AM IN THESE AREAS. INITIAL THINKING IS 
THERE WILL BE THE FIRST WAVE...WHICH WILL CONTAIN THE 
RAIN/FZRA/SLEET THEN SNOW. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE DIGGING INTO THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL EJECT ACROSS THE REGION LATE IN THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SNOW TO OCCUR ACROSS THE 
REGION..SINCE THE FREEZING LINE WILL CONTINUE TO SINK INTO NORTH MS 
THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY. PERHAPS 2 TO 4 INCHES COULD FALL ACROSS  
NORTHWEST TN...THE MO BOOTHEEL AND NORTHEAST AR AND UP TO 2 INCHES 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST TN AND PARTS OF N MS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE GENERAL 
GUESSES AT THIS POINT. NEW MODEL DATA SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH DETAIL  
TO PIN DOWN BETTER ESTIMATES OF SNOWFALL AMOUNTS.

DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO UPDATE THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME. COLD 
FRONT BISECTS THE MIDSOUTH NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST FROM ABOUT PARIS 
TN TO STUGGART AR. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO SAG SOUTHEASTWARD 
OVERNIGHT. BAND OF WIDESPREAD RAIN OCCURRING ALONG AND BEHIND THE 
FRONT IS ALSO EXPECTED TO SPREAD SOUTHEASTWARD OVERNIGHT WITH THE 
FRONT. FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET IS STILL POSSIBLE LATER TONIGHT FROM 
PARTS OF NORTHEAST AR INTO THE MO BOOTHEEL AS THE COLDER AIR SPREADS 
IN. WILL LEAVE PRESENT WINTER STORMS WARNINGS AND WATCHES AS IS. 

THERE HAVE BEEN SOME LIGHTNING STRIKES EARLIER THIS EVENING IN 
EASTERN AR...BUT THESE HAVE DIMINISHED. THE MESOETA DID INDICATE 
DECREASING CAPE THROUGH THIS AREA OVERNIGHT...SO DO NOT EXPECT 
ANYMORE THAN ISOLATED THUNDER AT BEST. 

18Z GFS/MESOETA SEEM DO BE COMING TOGETHER LITTLE BETTER THAN 
PREVIOUS RUNS CONCERNING CONTINUED WINTER WEATHER THREAT WEDNESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BOTH MODELS INDICATED A SURFACE LOW MOVING FROM 
SOUTHWEST MS AT 00Z THU TO NORTHERN AL BY 06Z THU. THE GFS WAS A 
LITTLE STRONGER WITH THE LOW AND A LITTLE WARMER.  
NEVERTHELESS...BOTH MODELS INDICATED COULD BE SIGNIFICANT ICING IN A 
BAND FROM AROUND MEMPHIS TO PARIS WITH HEAVY SNOW TO THE NORTHWEST 
FROM PARTS OF NORTHEAST AR INTO THE MO BOOTHEEL. IF 00Z MODELS 
CONTINUE THIS TREND...CONFIDENCE WILL INCREASE AND WINTER WEATHER 
WATCHES WILL LIKELY BE UPGRADED TO WARNINGS AND POSSIBLY EXTENDED IN 
AREA IN THE WED 4 AM PACKAGE. THE OUTLIER IS THE NGM WHICH SHOWS A 
WARMER SCENARIO WITH LESS WINTRY PRECIPITATION.

...WINTER STORM FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...

A LINE OF RAIN SHOWERS DEVELOPED LATE THIS MORNING OVER WEST 
TENNESSEE AND HAS BEEN MOVING SLOWLY NORTH. THIS BAND OF RAIN WILL 
SPREAD ACROSS MOST OF THE MID SOUTH THIS EVENING. ADDITIONAL LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND 
PROVIDE PLENTY OF FUEL...FOR THE RAIN WHICH MAY BE HEAVY AT TIMES 
AND LATER...THE FROZEN PRECIPITATION. 

AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT IS WHEN THE FREEZING LINE APPROACHES/ENTERS

THE UNCERTAINTY OF WHEN THE CHANGEOVER TO SNOW WILL OCCUR. IT 
APPEARS THAT SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT...RAIN WILL BEGIN TO MIX WITH 
SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. BY 4 AM...THE 
FREEZING LINE SHOULD PUSH THROUGH THE MO BOOTHEEL AND CAUSE THE 
SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN TO OCCUR. IT APPEARS THAT THE CHANGEOVER TO 
SNOW WILL OCCUR ACROSS THESE AREAS FIRST. WE ARE THINKING THAT WE 
WILL HAVE ALL SNOW BY 10 AM IN THESE AREAS. INITIAL THINKING IS 
THERE WILL BE THE FIRST WAVE...WHICH WILL CONTAIN THE 
RAIN/FZRA/SLEET THEN SNOW. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE DIGGING INTO THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL EJECT ACROSS THE REGION LATE IN THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SNOW TO OCCUR ACROSS THE 
REGION..SINCE THE FREEZING LINE WILL CONTINUE TO SINK INTO NORTH MS 
THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY. PERHAPS 2 TO 4 INCHES COULD FALL ACROSS  
NORTHWEST TN...THE MO BOOTHEEL AND NORTHEAST AR AND UP TO 2 INCHES 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST TN AND PARTS OF N MS. THESE AMOUNTS ARE GENERAL 
GUESSES AT THIS POINT. NEW MODEL DATA SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH DETAIL

317 AM CST TUE DEC 21 2004

.DISCUSSION...

...WINTER STORM STILL POSSIBLE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...

QUITE A FORECAST WE HAVE ON OUR HANDS. TAKING A QUICK LOOK AT THE 
SYNOPTIC SETUP...A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES MOVING IN FROM THE PACIFIC 
NW WILL HELP TO CARVE OUT A TROUGH THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE CENTRAL 
UNITED STATES. THIS WILL ACT TO STRENGTHEN A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE 
MIDSOUTH...PROVIDING THE SETUP FOR HEAVY RAIN AND POSSIBLE WINTER 
WEATHER.

THE EASY PART OF THE FORECAST IS THE NEXT TWELVE HOURS. STRONG WARM 
AIR ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA IN RESPONSE TO THE 
DEVELOPING TROUGH. MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO ADVECT INTO THE 
AREA...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AS 
THE SURFACE TROUGH BEGINS TO TIGHTEN AND GOOD ISENTROPIC LIFT 
OCCURS NEAR THE BOUNDARY. THE 500MB SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO THE 
CENTRAL US AFTER MIDNIGHT...PROVIDING ADDITIONAL DYNAMIC LIFT. 
THEREFORE...PRECIPITATION WILL DEVELOP OVER MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. SOME OF THE RAINFALL COULD BE HEAVY AND WILL 
HIGHLIGHT IN THE HWO.

NOW FOR THE HARD PART. COLD ARCTIC AIR LOCATED NORTH OF THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL ALLOW FOR PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH TO EXPERIENCE WINTER 
WEATHER. THE QUESTION IS HOW FAR DOES THE COLD AIR MOVE SOUTH BEFORE 
THE MOISTURE MOVES OUT? LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE NOT HELPING THE 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE FACTOR AS THEY HAVE COME IN WEAKER THAN PREVIOUS 
GUIDANCE. IN PARTICULAR...THE ETA MOVES THE MOISTURE OUT BY 00Z 
THURSDAY BEFORE THE COLD AIR MAKES IT INTO MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH. 
MEANWHILE...THE GFS IS SUFFERING FROM SOME FEEDBACK ISSUES MAKING IT 
HARD TO RELY ON. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WE WILL NOT STRAY FAR...IF AT 
ALL...FROM THE ONGOING FORECAST. IT STILL APPEARS THAT NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS WILL SEE A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW SOMETIME AFTER MIDNIGHT AS 
THE ENTIRE ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN RAPIDLY BECOMES FAVORABLE FOR SNOW. 
THE BOOTHEEL AND EXTREME NW TENNESSEE WILL LIKELY CHANGE OVER 
SOMETIME AFTER 12Z. WITH THIS THINKING...FEEL THAT IT IS PRUDENT TO 
KEEP THE WINTER STORM WATCH AS IS. HOPEFULLY THE 12Z GUIDANCE WILL 
HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON THINGS AND THE DAYSHIFT WILL MAKE THE FINAL 
DECISION FOR ANY WARNINGS OR ADVISORIES THAT WILL BE NEEDED.

PRECIP TYPE FOR THE REST OF THE MIDSOUTH IS STILL UNCERTAIN. IT WILL 
ALL COME DOWN TO HOW LONG THE MOISTURE REMAINS PRESENT AND SOON THE 
COLD AIR WILL MOVE IN. STILL THINK A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW WILL OCCUR 
LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO WEDNESDAY EVENING. BY THE TIME THE 
ATMOSPHERE BECOMES CONDUCIVE FOR SNOW...MOST OF THE MOISTURE LOOKS 
TO BE MOVING OUT. CANNOT RULE OUT SOME PLACES RECEIVING UP TO AN 
INCH...ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE. FORECAST SOUNDINGS DO 
SHOW THAT FREEZING RAIN MAY BE AN ISSUE AS WELL OVER WEST TN. IF 
THIS COMES TO FRUITION...THEN ADVISORIES OR WARNINGS MAY HAVE TO BE 
EXTENDED FURTHER SOUTH. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT ALL OF THIS ACTIVE 
WEATHER WILL BE OUT OF THE REGION BY 12Z THURSDAY.

ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. 
CHRISTMAS EVE AND DAY LOOKING VERY COLD. ADJUSTED TEMPS DOWN SOME 
ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT MAY HAVE A SNOWPACK. NEW MEX NUMBERS SHOW A 
RAPID WARMUP BEGINNING SUNDAY...BUT WILL GO BELOW GUIDANCE FOR NOW 
AS THIS IS A RADICAL CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS GUIDANCE.

CURRENT FORECAST IS FINE AND NO UPDATES NEEDED. TIGHT SURFACE
GRADIENT IS CONTINUING TO PRODUCE A STRONG SOUTH WIND FLOW ACROSS
THE MIDSOUTH THIS EVENING. THINK TEMPERATURES WILL HOLD STEADY OR
PERHAPS EVEN RISE A DEGREE OR SO OVERNIGHT. TEMPERATURE GRADIENT IS
IMPRESSIVE WITH 39 DEGREES AT JACKSON AND 57 AT LITTLE ROCK.
MOISTURE WILL ALSO BE ON THE SLOW INCREASE OVERNIGHT. SATELLITE
SHOWS CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. HOWEVER...THE MESOETA HAS
BEEN PERSISTENT IN SHOWING LOWER CLOUDS DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT IN THE
WARMER AND MORE MOIST AIR ADVECTION.

STILL WAITING ON 00Z MODEL DATA TO RE-EXAMINE WINTER WEATHER THREAT
FROM LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. STAY TUNED.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 313 PM CDT MON DEC 20 2004

...WINTER STORM BREWING FOR TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...

PRIMARY FOCUS TODAY WAS ON PINPOINTING THE AREAS OF HEAVIEST SNOW
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE MODELS WERE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON
POSITION AND STRENGTH OF THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM WHICH WILL BEGIN TO
AFFECT THE REGION ON TUESDAY.

FIRST WILL BE RAIN WHICH WILL SLOWLY SPREAD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO
THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS TUESDAY. EXPECT
THE RAIN TO SPREAD NORTHWARD AFTER 6 PM...TOWARD THE MO BOOTHEEL AND
EXTREME NORTHEAST AR. THE INTENSE TROUGH DIGGING INTO THE CENTRAL
U.S. WILL HELP PULL PLENTY OF MOISTURE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE MID
SOUTH. ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVES PASSING IN THE FLOW OVER THE OHIO
VALLEY WILL POSE THE THREAT OF PUSHING THE VERY COLD TEMPERATURES
INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. THIS IS WHERE THE RAIN WILL CHANGE OVER TO
SNOW FIRST AS THE WHOLE TEMPERATURE PROFILE RAPIDLY COOLS TO BELOW
FREEZING BY OR SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT.

INITIAL SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE IN THE 4 TO 6 INCH RANGE AND MAINLY
BE CONFINED TO NORTHEAST AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL ALONG AND NORTH OF A
JONESBORO TO HORNERSVILLE TO HAYTI LINE. MOST OF THIS SNOW WILL
OCCUR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...DURING THE DAY.

THIS COLD AIRMASS WILL SLOWLY PUSH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND
BEGIN TO CHANGE RAIN TO SNOW DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY. A FEW AREAS
COULD SEE SLEET FOR A BRIEF TIME BEFORE CHANGING OVER TO SNOW
BECAUSE OF THE RAPID COOLING OF THE AIR COLUMN. THE LAST PLACE TO
CHANGE OVER TO SNOW WILL BE SOUTHEAST AND EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA. THIS IS THE AREA WHERE THE COLUMN SHOULD REMAIN ABOVE
FREEZING THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY AFTERNOON WEDNESDAY. IF ENOUGH LIFT
STILL EXISTS LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THEN SNOWFALL WILL OCCUR
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN AND EASTERN AREAS. ALL OTHER AREAS HAVE A
POSSIBILITY OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF UP TO ONE INCH...WHICH INCLUDES
THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA.

ONCE THIS SYSTEM PASSES...VERY COLD TEMPERATURES ARE IN STORE FOR
THE AREA...ESPECIALLY WHERE SNOW COVERS THE GROUND. TRIED TO ACCOUNT
FOR THIS IN THE FORECAST GRIDS. MAX TEMPS ON WEDNESDAY WILL OCCUR AT
6 OR 7 AM...WITH TEMPERATURES FALLING THROUGH THE DAY.

A SLOW RECOVERY TO TEMPERATURES BACK TO NEAR NORMAL IS EXPECTED AND
A DRY PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH NEXT MONDAY.

...WINTER STORM BREWING FOR TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...

PRIMARY FOCUS TODAY WAS ON PINPOINTING THE AREAS OF HEAVIEST SNOW 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE MODELS WERE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON 
POSITION AND STRENGTH OF THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM WHICH WILL BEGIN TO 
AFFECT THE REGION ON TUESDAY. 

FIRST WILL BE RAIN WHICH WILL SLOWLY SPREAD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO 
THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS TUESDAY. EXPECT 
THE RAIN TO SPREAD NORTHWARD AFTER 6 PM...TOWARD THE MO BOOTHEEL AND 
EXTREME NORTHEAST AR. THE INTENSE TROUGH DIGGING INTO THE CENTRAL 
U.S. WILL HELP PULL PLENTY OF MOISTURE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH. ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVES PASSING IN THE FLOW OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY WILL POSE THE THREAT OF PUSHING THE VERY COLD TEMPERATURES

LOW PRESSURE TROUGH CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH NORTHEAST ARKANSAS THIS
AFTERNOON. THE TROUGH DOES HAVE SOME CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT
IS MAINLY JUST A WIND SHIFT BOUNDARY AS WINDS BECOME NORTHWEST
BEHIND THE TROUGH.

COLD FRONT CURRENTLY THROUGH NORTHERN ILLINOIS INTO SOUTHERN IOWA AND
EASTERN NEBRASKA. THIS FRONT SHOULD MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH THE REGION
LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. VERY LITTLE IF ANY
PRECIPITATION IS OCCURRING AHEAD OF THE FRONT RIGHT NOW SO HAVE
PULLED OUT MENTION OF SPRINKLES FOR EARLY THIS EVENING. WILL LEAVE
MENTION OF FLURRIES FOR OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING AS WHAT
LITTLE MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE WILL GET SQUEEZED OUT.

SURFACE HIGH NOW OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA WILL DROP DOWN RAPIDLY BEHIND
THE FRONT AND SETTLE OVER THE MID-SOUTH BY SUNDAY NIGHT. VERY COLD
AIR WILL IN BEHIND THE FRONT. EXPECT LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A WARM-UP
SUNDAY AS TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY BE FALLING THROUGHOUT THE DAY
ALLOWING READINGS TO DROP INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS OVER EASTERN
SECTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE. AS THE HIGH SETTLES IN SUNDAY NIGHT...
WINDS WILL DIMINISH AS WELL. THIS SHOULD KEEP WIND CHILL READING
ABOVE ZERO OVER MOST OF THE REGION SO SEE NO REASON TO ISSUE A WIND
CHILL ADVISORY AT THIS TIME.

SURFACE HIGH MOVES OUT AS QUICKLY AS IT ARRIVES AND SLIDES OFF TO THE
SOUTHEAST BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. THIS WILL ALLOW WINDS TO SHIFT TO THE
SOUTH AND HELP TO WARM THINGS UP SOMEWHAT. WARM ADVECTION WILL BEGIN
IN EARNEST MONDAY NIGHT WHICH WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING
MUCH AT ALL. HAVE BUMPED UP LOWS FOR TUESDAY MORNING ABOUT 5-8
DEGREES REGION WIDE. TUESDAY APPEARS THAT IT WILL BE SIMILAR TO
TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES APPROACHING 60 DEGREES.

NEXT FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. RAIN WILL
BE FOUND FROM TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. COLD FRONT SHOULD BE
EAST OF THE REGION BY THURSDAY MORNING BUT WILL KEEP A MENTION OF
FLURRIES IN FOR THURSDAY MORNING.

MODELS STARTING TO COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT REGARDING NEXT
WEEKEND AS THEY TRY TO DEVELOP A CLOSED LOW OVER THE REGION BY
CHRISTMAS MORNING. STILL HESITANT TO MENTION ANYTHING YET FOR NEXT
WEEKEND AS CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION STILL VERY IFFY.

.DISCUSSION...
LOW PRESSURE TROUGH CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH NORTHEAST ARKANSAS THIS
AFTERNOON. THE TROUGH DOES HAVE SOME CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT
IS MAINLY JUST A WIND SHIFT BOUNDARY AS WINDS BECOME NORTHWEST
BEHIND THE TROUGH.

COLD FRONT CURRENTLY THROUGH NORTHERN ILLINOIS INTO SOUTHERN IOWA AND
EASTERN NEBRASKA. THIS FRONT SHOULD MAKE ITS WAY THROUGH THE REGION
LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. VERY LITTLE IF ANY
PRECIPITATION IS OCCURRING AHEAD OF THE FRONT RIGHT NOW SO HAVE
PULLED OUT MENTION OF SPRINKLES FOR EARLY THIS EVENING. WILL LEAVE
MENTION OF FLURRIES FOR OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING AS WHAT
LITTLE MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE WILL GET SQUEEZED OUT.

SURFACE HIGH NOW OVER SOUTHERN MANITOBA WILL DROP DOWN RAPIDLY BEHIND
THE FRONT AND SETTLE OVER THE MID-SOUTH BY SUNDAY NIGHT. VERY COLD
AIR WILL IN BEHIND THE FRONT. EXPECT LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A WARM-UP
SUNDAY AS TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY BE FALLING THROUGHOUT THE DAY
ALLOWING READINGS TO DROP INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS OVER EASTERN
SECTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE. AS THE HIGH SETTLES IN SUNDAY NIGHT...
WINDS WILL DIMINISH AS WELL. THIS SHOULD KEEP WIND CHILL READING
ABOVE ZERO OVER MOST OF THE REGION SO SEE NO REASON TO ISSUE A WIND
CHILL ADVISORY AT THIS TIME.

SURFACE HIGH MOVES OUT AS QUICKLY AS IT ARRIVES AND SLIDES OFF TO THE
SOUTHEAST BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. THIS WILL ALLOW WINDS TO SHIFT TO THE
SOUTH AND HELP TO WARM THINGS UP SOMEWHAT. WARM ADVECTION WILL BEGIN
IN EARNEST MONDAY NIGHT WHICH WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING
MUCH AT ALL. HAVE BUMPED UP LOWS FOR TUESDAY MORNING ABOUT 5-8
DEGREES REGION WIDE. TUESDAY APPEARS THAT IT WILL BE SIMILAR TO
TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES APPROACHING 60 DEGREES.

NEXT FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH REGION TUESDAY NIGHT. RAIN WILL
BE FOUND FROM TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. COLD FRONT SHOULD BE
EAST OF THE REGION BY THURSDAY MORNING BUT WILL KEEP A MENTION OF
FLURRIES IN FOR THURSDAY MORNING.

MODELS STARTING TO COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT REGARDING NEXT
WEEKEND AS THEY TRY TO DEVELOP A CLOSED LOW OVER THE REGION BY
CHRISTMAS MORNING. STILL HESITANT TO MENTION ANYTHING YET FOR NEXT
WEEKEND AS CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION STILL VERY IFFY.

LOW PRESSURE TROUGH CURRENTLY EXTENDS FROM SOUTHEAST WISCONSIN INTO
NORTH TEXAS THIS MORNING WITH STRONG COLD FRONT ACROSS THE NORTHERN
PLAINS. THE SURFACE TROUGH WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION LATER TODAY
AND HELP SHIFT THE WINDS FROM THE SOUTH TO MORE OF A WESTERLY
DIRECTION. COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE REGION LATE TONIGHT
FOLLOWED BY A STEADY DROP IN TEMPERATURES THROUGH MUCH OF SUNDAY.
STILL CANT RULE OUT SOME SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES AS THE FRONT SQUEEZES
WHAT LITTLE MOISTURE THAT IS AVAILABLE. CURRENT FORECAST SEEMS TO

HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE MIDSOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. 
WITH CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS...ANOTHER NIGHT OF GOOD RADIATIONAL 
COOLING WILL SET UP. DEWPOINTS ARE A LITTLE HIGH TODAY SO NOT 
EXPECTING TEMPS TO BE QUITE AS COLD AS THIS MORNING. ALSO...SOME 
CLOUDS WILL LIKELY ENTER INTO THE AREA BEFORE SUNRISE. ALL IN 
ALL...A TRANQUIL NIGHT IS IN ORDER.

SATURDAY WILL SEE NEAR NORMAL NORMAL HIGHS ALONG WITH A LIGHT 
SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW. THINGS BEGIN TO CHANGE IN EARNEST SATURDAY 
EVENING AS A POWERFUL ARCTIC FRONT ADVANCES TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH. 
THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE MOISTURE FOR THE FRONT TO WORK 
WITH...ALMOST NONE IF YOU BELIEVE THE ETA. HAVE DECIDED TO MENTION A 
CHANCE OF SPRINKLES SATURDAY EVENING AND A CHANCE OF FLURRIES 
OVERNIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BE VERY 
STRONG AND WILL SERVE TO RING OUT WHATEVER MOISTURE IS PRESENT. HAVE 
TAKEN OUT ALL MENTION OF POPS DUE TO NO EXPECTED ACCUMULATIONS. 
ASIDE FORM THE FLURRIES...THE COLD TEMPERATURES WILL BE THE MAIN 
FOCUS. EXPECT HIGHS TO BE REACHED VERY EARLY IN THE DAY WITH 
TEMPERATURES FALLING THROUGH THE 20S DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY. 
COMBINE THIS WITH WINDS OF AROUND 15 TO 20 MPH AND IT WILL FEEL VERY 
COLD OUTSIDE. THE ARCTIC HIGH WILL SETTLE INTO THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT 
ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO DIP INTO THE LOWER TO MID TEENS...WITH SOME 
SINGLE DIGITS POSSIBLE IN THE NORMALLY COLDER LOCATIONS. WIND CHILLS 
ARE FORECASTED TO BE FROM ZERO TO 10 DEGREES SUNDAY EVENING/NIGHT. 
WILL ISSUE A SPS TO GIVE A HEADS UP TO THIS SITUATION. WIND CHILLS 
WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED AND A WIND CHILL ADVISORY (ISSUED FOR WIND 
CHILLS BELOW ZERO) MAY HAVE TO BE ISSUED AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE 
EVENT.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY SLIP EAST OF THE AREA ON MONDAY WITH A 
RETURN FLOW SETTING UP. SOME QUESTION AS TO HOW QUICK THE ARCTIC AIR 
MASS WILL BE SCOURED OUT OF THE REGION. WENT BELOW GUIDANCE FOR 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. MODELS ALWAYS HAVE A HABIT OF MODIFYING 
ARCTIC AIRMASSES TOO QUICKLY AND THIS MAY BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 
THAT. 

NEXT FRONT WILL ENTER THE AREA LATE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. HAVE 
CHANCE POPS GOING FOR THIS TIME FRAME. GFS AND ECMWF IN DISAGREEMENT 
ON THE TIMING OF THE FRONT AND THE COLD AIR. FEEL GFS MAY BE TOO 
FAST WITH COLD AIR SO WILL GO WITH ALL RAIN THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 
ENOUGH COLD AIR MAY SLIP IN BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR A BRIEF 
CHANGEOVER TO ALL SNOW...BUT THAT IS VERY UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT.

WHAT IS MORE CERTAIN IS THAT ANOTHER ARCTIC AIRMASS WILL AFFECT THE 
MIDSOUTH FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. MUCH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
EXPECTED. INDEED...SANTA AND HIS REINDEER MAY FEEL RIGHT AT HOME ON 
CHRISTMAS EVE.

.UPDATE...
SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH OVERNIGHT WITH MOST OF 
THE CLOUD COVER PUSHING TO THE EAST OF THE CWFA. CLEAR SKIES AND

THE USUAL COLDER AREAS OF THE WEST TN. WL UPDATE TO TWEAK TEMPS AND

.DISCUSSION...
A WEAKENING SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE MID-
SOUTH THIS EVENING. ENOUGH LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE HAS ADVECTED
NORTHWARD INTO PORTIONS OF NORTH MISSISSIPPI AHEAD OF THIS
DISTURBANCE TO PRODUCE SOME SPRINKLES AND LIGHT SHOWERS. THIS WILL
CONTINUE THIS EVENING ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTH MISSISSIPPI...ENDING
BEFORE MIDNIGHT. ANY PRECIP THAT FALLS WILL REMAIN VERY LIGHT...AS
TEMPERATURE/DEWPOINT SPREADS REMAIN AROUND 15 DEGREES OR LARGER. IN
ADDITION...WITH THE DRY AIR IN PLACE...WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE
A FEW ISOLATED REPORTS OF SLEET AS WET-BULB ZERO HEIGHTS GET CLOSE
TO THE SURFACE. ANY FROZEN PRECIPITATION THAT FALLS WILL BE BRIEF
AND ISOLATED...SO NOT EXPECTING ANY TYPE OF PROBLEMS. THE UPPER
SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN...BUT WILL SEND A WEAK COLD FRONT
ACROSS THE AREA LATER TONIGHT. NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF COLD AIR
BEHIND THIS FRONT...SO TEMPERATURES TOMORROW SHOULD ONCE AGAIN BE
SEASONABLE.

THE BIG STORY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE STRONG COLD FRONT THAT IS
POISED TO MOVE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH ON SATURDAY EVENING. EXPECT
ENOUGH MOISTURE AHEAD OF THIS FRONT TO ALLOW FOR RAIN SHOWERS TO
DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS FRONT FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
SATURDAY WILL BE THE LAST SEASONABLY WARM DAY DURING THE REMAINDER OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL BEGIN TO FILTER SOUTH INTO
THE AREA LATER SATURDAY NIGHT...AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES DROP TO AROUND
-8C NORTH TO -4C SOUTH. THERE SHOULD BE JUST ENOUGH MOISTURE AROUND
TO PRODUCE SOME FLURRIES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE MID-SOUTH
LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING...AS WE DO GET SOME ICE
NUCLEATION AROUND -10C FOR A TIME AS INDICATED BY MESO-ETA REGIONAL
FORECAST SOUNDINGS. LOW CLOUDS SHOULD ALSO PERSIST THROUGH MUCH OF
SUNDAY WITH FALLING TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE 20S ON SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...AS A REINFORCING SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR SLIDES SOUTH INTO THE
REGION. SUNDAY SHOULD BE WINDY AND THE COLDEST DAY OF THE YEAR SO
FAR...WITH 850 MB TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON ONLY PROGGED
BETWEEN -12C AND -18C AND LOWERING THICKNESSES THROUGH THE DAY.
ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE AREA FOR SUNDAY NIGHT...
ALLOWING FOR CLEARING SKIES...DIMINISHING WINDS...AND VERY COLD
TEMPERATURES. LOWS SHOULD BE AROUND 10F NORTH TO LOW-MID TEENS
ELSEWHERE. ANOTHER COLD DAY FOR MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OVER
THE AREA. THIS HIGH WILL MOVE TO OUR EAST BY TUESDAY...WITH
MODERATING TEMPERATURES.

ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY AND TUESDAY
NIGHT. THIS WILL BRING THE NEXT CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION OVER THE
AREA...WITH MAINLY RAIN. MAY BE COLD ENOUGH TUESDAY NIGHT FOR RAIN
OR SNOW ACROSS OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES...SO HAVE KEPT THIS IN THE
FORECAST. COOL TEMPERATURES WILL FOLLOW THE FRONT FOR THE MIDDLE OF
THE WEEK. ANOTHER SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR IS PROGGED TO INVADE THE
REGION JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS. BOTH THE 00Z EUROPEAN AND THE 12Z GFS
HINTED AT THIS...WITH ANOTHER HIGHLY AMPLIFIED DEEP TROUGH DIGGING
INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES. THE MODELS ALSO INDICATE
MOISTURE WITH THIS FRONT...SO HAVE ADDED SLIGHT CHANCES FOR RAIN OR
SNOW ACROSS THE AREA WITH THIS SYSTEM. THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF
TIME TO MONITOR THIS SCENARIO...SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE HOW THIS

TO THE SURFACE. ANY FROZEN PRECIPITATION THAT FALLS WILL BE BRIEF
AND ISOLATED...SO NOT EXPECTING ANY TYPE OF PROBLEMS. THE UPPER
SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN...BUT WILL SEND A WEAK COLD FRONT
ACROSS THE AREA LATER TONIGHT. NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF COLD AIR
BEHIND THIS FRONT...SO TEMPERATURES TOMORROW SHOULD ONCE AGAIN BE
SEASONABLE.

THE BIG STORY WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE STRONG COLD FRONT THAT IS
POISED TO MOVE ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH ON SATURDAY EVENING. EXPECT
ENOUGH MOISTURE AHEAD OF THIS FRONT TO ALLOW FOR RAIN SHOWERS TO
DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS FRONT FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
SATURDAY WILL BE THE LAST SEASONABLY WARM DAY DURING THE REMAINDER OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL BEGIN TO FILTER SOUTH INTO
THE AREA LATER SATURDAY NIGHT...AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES DROP TO AROUND
-8C NORTH TO -4C SOUTH. THERE SHOULD BE JUST ENOUGH MOISTURE AROUND
TO PRODUCE SOME FLURRIES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE MID-SOUTH
LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING...AS WE DO GET SOME ICE
NUCLEATION AROUND -10C FOR A TIME AS INDICATED BY MESO-ETA REGIONAL
FORECAST SOUNDINGS. LOW CLOUDS SHOULD ALSO PERSIST THROUGH MUCH OF
SUNDAY WITH FALLING TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE 20S ON SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...AS A REINFORCING SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR SLIDES SOUTH INTO THE
REGION. SUNDAY SHOULD BE WINDY AND THE COLDEST DAY OF THE YEAR SO
FAR...WITH 850 MB TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON ONLY PROGGED
BETWEEN -12C AND -18C AND LOWERING THICKNESSES THROUGH THE DAY.
ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE AREA FOR SUNDAY NIGHT...
ALLOWING FOR CLEARING SKIES...DIMINISHING WINDS...AND VERY COLD
TEMPERATURES. LOWS SHOULD BE AROUND 10F NORTH TO LOW-MID TEENS
ELSEWHERE. ANOTHER COLD DAY FOR MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OVER
THE AREA. THIS HIGH WILL MOVE TO OUR EAST BY TUESDAY...WITH
MODERATING TEMPERATURES.

ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY AND TUESDAY
NIGHT. THIS WILL BRING THE NEXT CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION OVER THE
AREA...WITH MAINLY RAIN. MAY BE COLD ENOUGH TUESDAY NIGHT FOR RAIN
OR SNOW ACROSS OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES...SO HAVE KEPT THIS IN THE
FORECAST. COOL TEMPERATURES WILL FOLLOW THE FRONT FOR THE MIDDLE OF
THE WEEK. ANOTHER SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR IS PROGGED TO INVADE THE
REGION JUST BEFORE CHRISTMAS. BOTH THE 00Z EUROPEAN AND THE 12Z GFS
HINTED AT THIS...WITH ANOTHER HIGHLY AMPLIFIED DEEP TROUGH DIGGING
INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES. THE MODELS ALSO INDICATE
MOISTURE WITH THIS FRONT...SO HAVE ADDED SLIGHT CHANCES FOR RAIN OR
SNOW ACROSS THE AREA WITH THIS SYSTEM. THERE IS STILL PLENTY OF
TIME TO MONITOR THIS SCENARIO...SO WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE HOW THIS
END OF NEXT WEEK SYSTEM PLAYS OUT.

HIGH PRESSURE OVER NORTH ALABAMA HAS RESULTED IN ANOTHER COOL NIGHT 
ACROSS THE REGION. A SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL IOWA 
THROUGH THE WESTERN OKLAHOMA. SATELLITE SHOWS CIRRUS MOVING THROUGH 
THE REGION WITH THICKER MID LEVEL CLOUDS OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS 
MOVING TOWARDS THE REGION. 

EXPECT CLOUDS TO BE INCREASING TODAY AS THE SURFACE TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED UPPER SHORTWAVE APPROACH. PASSAGE OF THE SURFACE TROUGH 
SHOULD BE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. STRENGTH OF THIS 
FEATURE IS RELATIVELY WEAK AND LOW LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE STILL 
LOOK TOO DRY FOR PRECIP. LOOKING AT SATELLITE..GFS LOOKS LIKE IT HAS 
TOO MUCH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEHIND THIS SYSTEM WHILE THE ETA SEEMS 
TO HAVE A MUCH BETTER HANDLE ON IT. AS A RESULT...EXPECT A SLOW 
CLEARING TONIGHT WITH MOST AREAS BEING AT LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY BY 
TOMORROW. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS IN FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. 
ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO TEMP FORECAST DURING THIS PERIOD.

THE NEXT FRONT ARRIVES SATURDAY NIGHT. CURRENT FORECAST HAS A CHANCE 
OF FLURRIES ROUGHLY NORTH OF THE TN/MS LINE SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE 
GFS ONCE AGAIN SHOWING A GOOD DEAL OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE POURING 
INTO THE REGION. ETA DOES NOT SHOW THIS. LOOKING AT HOW POOR THE GFS 
SEEMS TO BE HANDLING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW...HAVE 
SOME DOUBTS AS TO WHETHER OR NOT THERE WILL BE ANY FLAKES AROUND. 
CANT TOTALLY RULE IT OUT SO LEFT THE MENTION IN THERE. THE BIG NEWS 
IS WITH THE BIG BLAST OF COLD AIR THAT SURGES INTO THE REGION ON 
SUNDAY. THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE STRENGTH OF 
THE COLD AIR. THE GFS IS A FEW DEGREES COLDER THAN THE ECMWF AND 
POSITIONS THE MAIN COLD AIR AXIS OVER THE MIDSOUTH WHEREAS THE ECMWF 
IS FURTHER EAST OVER MIDDLE AND EASTERN TN. IF THE GFS PANS 
OUT...THE COLD WEATHER OUTBREAK FROM EARLIER THIS WEEK WILL SEEM 
MILD IN COMPARISON. WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF THE DAILY HIGHS FOR 
SUNDAY OCCUR AT MIDNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE 12Z-00Z HIGHS 
OCCURRING RIGHT AT 12Z. GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF COLD AIR ADVECTION 
THAT OCCURS DURING THE DAY...WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF TEMPS FALL 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY OR AT BEST RAISE ONLY A COUPLE OF DEGREES. THE 
LATEST MEX NUMBERS ARE NOT UNREASONABLE. ALTHOUGH KEEP IN MIND THAT 
IT ASSUMES THAT THE AIR WILL BE AS COLD AS THE GFS IS ADVERTISING 
AND THAT THE POSITION OF THE COLD AIR WILL SET UP EXACTLY OVER THE 
REGION. WITH THAT IN MIND...HAVE MINS FOR MONDAY MORNING A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER THAN MEX NUMBERS. 

THE UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST OF THE REGION EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH 
THE FLOW QUICKLY BECOMING MORE ZONAL. BOTH GFS/ECMWF INDICATE 
ANOTHER SYSTEM ARRIVING TUESDAY NIGHT. LOOKING AT PARTIAL 
THICKNESSES...SNOW IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM OVER 
NORTHWEST TN...NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE BOOTHEEL.

IN FROM THE WEST. SFC WINDS ARE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AND TEMPS ALREADY 
HAVE FALLEN INTO THE MID 20S TO LOWER 30S. HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL 
OVERNIGHT. WL UPDATE FOR TIME SENSITIVE WIND WORDING.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 346 PM...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY TO THE EAST...BUT WILL
REMAIN IN CONTROL OF THE MIDSOUTHS WEATHER OVERNIGHT. THIS MEANS
ANOTHER COLD NIGHT IN STORE...ALTHOUGH WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT AS
WEAK RETURN SOUTHERLY FLOW DOES SET UP. EXPECT CLEAR SKIES AND
LIGHT WINDS...SO TEMPERATURES SHOULD FALL OFF INTO THE LOWER TO MID
20S IN MOST AREAS...EXCEPT IN THE WARMER URBAN AREAS (MEM). HIGH
PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE FURTHER TO THE EAST ON THURSDAY.
THIS WILL ALLOW CONTINUED SOUTHERLY FLOW AND A SLOW INCREASE IN MID
LEVEL MOISTURE BY LATER TOMORROW AFTERNOON. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO
REBOUND WELL INTO THE 40S TO LOWER 50S. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AHEAD OF A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD
FRONT MOVING OUT OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS STATES. THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE
THROUGH THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT...BRINGING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES.
LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN SHOULD PREVENT RAIN WITH THIS
FRONT...AND IT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH DRY. SLIGHTLY COOLER WEATHER IS
EXPECTED ON FRIDAY...WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND SLIGHTLY COOLER
TEMPERATURES.

THE BIG STORY FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE THE ARCTIC COLD FRONT
PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH ON SATURDAY EVENING.
SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED ON SATURDAY BEFORE MUCH
COLDER AIR MOVES IN FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEKEND. FOLLOWING THE
PASSAGE OF THE FRONT SATURDAY EVENING...EXPECT STRONG COLD AIR
ADVECTION TO OCCUR LATER SATURDAY NIGHT. AS THIS VERY COLD AIRMASS
PUSHES IN...IT SHOULD SQUEEZE OUT ALL AVAILABLE MOISTURE. SO EXPECT
SCATTERED SNOW FLURRIES ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA LATER
SATURDAY NIGHT. SUNDAY WILL BE A BLUSTERY AND COLD DAY WITH
CONTINUED STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION. 850 MB TEMPS FORECAST BY
THE 12Z GFS TO DROP TO NEAR -20C ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THE ECMWF IS A BIT LESS AGGRESSIVE WITH THE
AMPLITUDE OF THE TROUGH...BUT EITHER WAY MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES
CAN BE EXPECTED. TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO GET INTO THE LOW 30S
NORTH TO UPPER 30S SOUTH ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. EVEN COLDER
TEMPERATURES INTO THE TEENS ARE FORECAST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT.

CONTINUED COLD TEMPERATURES UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES CAN BE EXPECTED
FOR MONDAY...WITH A SLOW MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE
BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK AS THE DEEP TROUGH MOVES EAST AND ZONAL FLOW
RETURNS. THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM TO AFFECT OUR REGIONS WEATHER IN
THE EXTENDED WILL BE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER
COLD FRONT WILL DROP THROUGH THE AREA...WITH MOISTURE POISED TO
OVERRUN THE FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MARGINAL WITH THIS SYSTEM
ACROSS EXTREME NORTHERN AREAS TUESDAY NIGHT...SO HAVE INTRODUCED
CHANCE FOR RAIN OR SNOW OVER THESE AREAS. ELSEWHERE...SHOULD

THE WARM SIDE WITH THE AIR MASS NOT AS DRY AS ANTICIPATED BUT STILL 
NOTICEABLY COLD. MEMPHIS AIRPORT APPEARS TO BE AN OUTLIER IN THE 
METRO AREA WITH SURROUNDING OBS...INCLUDING AT THE WEATHER SERVICE 
ALL IN THE LOWER 20S TO AROUND 20.  THIS MAY POSSIBLY BE DUE TO AIR 
TRAFFIC MIXING THE ATMOSPHERE AT THE COMPLEX. 

NO MAJOR CHANGES MADE TO SHORT TERM PORTION OF THE FORECAST. HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL GRADUALLY SLIDE EAST OF THE REGION. A FEW CIRRUS SEEN 
BY SATELLITE OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL DRIFT THROUGH THE REGION 
TODAY AND TONIGHT. A WEAK SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
APPROACH THE REGION THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. ALL INDICATIONS ARE 
THAT THE ATMOSPHERE IS TOO DRY FOR ANYTHING MORE THAN CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS. 

DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY. HOWEVER NEWEST MODELS 
GFS/ECMWF ARE POINTING TOWARD ANOTHER STRONG COLD FRONT BLOWING 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY WITH ANOTHER BLAST OF ARCTIC AIR. 
THE GFS MAY BE TOO STRONG WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE COLD AIR AS IT 
BRINGS THE COLDEST AIR STRAIGHT DOWN FROM THE NORTH POLE OVER THE 
REGION...WHILE THE ECMWF SLIDES IT MORE EASTWARD TOWARDS THE 
APPALACHIANS. AS A RESULT HAVE SLASHED TEMPS DOWNWARD. WILL CONTINUE 
A DRY FORECAST...ALTHOUGH AM WORRIED ABOUT SOME RAIN DEVELOPING 
ALONG THE FRONT. THE DEPTH OF THE MOISTURE IS THE BIG QUESTION HERE. 
ANY WRAP AROUND PRECIPITATION DUE TO THE FORMATION OF A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IN THE BASE OF THE TROUGH AS SUGGESTED BY THE GFS SHOULD STAY 
EAST OF THE REGION. RIDGING ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE TROUGH SHOULD 
KEEP THE WEATHER DRY INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

UPDATED FORECAST WITH OBS AND SATELLITE SHOWING SOME STREAKS OF 
CLOUDS MOVING SOUTHWARD FROM KENTUCKY. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

SURFACE MAP THIS MORNING PLACES AN AREA OF ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
EASTERN KANSAS. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS MAINLY CLEAR SKIES OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH. BASE OF UPPER TROUGH WILL SWING THROUGH THE REGION TODAY. 
WHILE THIS WILL RESULT IN MAINLY SUNNY SKIES...IT WILL ALSO BE VERY 
COLD TODAY. HAVE ONLY MADE SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FORECAST 
THROUGH THE FIRST 48 HOURS. FWC/MAV IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN MOST CASES 
FOR TODAYS HIGHS. MODEL SOUNDINGS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MAV TEMPS. 
MAV FOR MEMPHIS WAS TOO COLD YESTERDAY AND SOUNDINGS HERE LEANING 
MORE TOWARDS FWC NUMBERS. HIGHS SHOULD RANGE FROM MID 30S ALONG THE 
MO/KY BORDER TO NEAR 40 FROM CLARKSDALE TO TUPELO AND POINTS 
SOUTHWARD.

TONIGHT THE SURFACE HIGHS SETTLES OVER THE REGION. VERY COLD TONIGHT 
WITH LOW DEW POINTS...WINDS BECOMING LIGHT AND SKIES CLEAR. TUPELO 
MAY APPROACH THEIR RECORD LOW OF 14 IN 1989. TEMPS ACROSS PORTIONS 
OF WEST TN AWAY FROM THE DELTA WILL BE IN THE LOWER TO MID 30S AND 
WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF A COUPLE SITES CHECKED IN WITH LOWS IN THE 
SINGLE DIGITS. 

THE HIGH WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT EAST OF THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY AND 
WINDS WILL GRADUALLY COME BACK AROUND TO THE SOUTH WITH MODEL 
SOUNDINGS SHOWING TEMPS IN THE LOWER TO MID 40S FOR HIGHS. PROBABLY 
NOT AS COLD WEDNESDAY NIGHT SINCE DEW POINTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE A 
LITTLE HIGHER. LOWERED TEMPS A LITTLE ON THURSDAY WITH BOTH GFS/ETA 
SHOWING THE 950MB WARM AIR ADVECTION NOT AS AGGRESSIVE AS PREVIOUSLY 
FORECASTED. SOUNDINGS SUPPORTING HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40S TO AROUND 
50. 

ON THURSDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE REGION IN 
THE NORTHWEST FLOW. THE GFS HAS AN INTERESTING SOLUTION THIS 
MORNING...ONE THAT SUGGESTS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION PERHAPS 
JUST BARELY IN THE LIQUID FORM. THE GFS IS MUCH STRONGER AND FURTHER 
SOUTH IN THE UPPER TROUGH THAN THE ETA/UKMET/ECMWF WHICH KEEPS THE 
MORE POTENT PORTION OF THIS SYSTEM ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. THE GFS 
LOOKS LIKE THE OUTLIER SINCE IT PHASES THE TROUGH WITH THE SOUTHERN 
JET THAT WILL BE CUTTING JUST ACROSS CENTRAL MS. AS A RESULT...HAVE 
CONTINUED DRY FORECAST INTO THE WEEKEND.

THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON CONTINUE TO POUR INTO THE MID SOUTH AS 
ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE PLAINS CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO 
THE MID SOUTH. TEMPS BLO FREEZING COMBINED WITH SFC WINDS OF 15 MPH 
PRODUCING WIND CHILLS OF 8-12 DEGREES FROM UNION CITY TO DYERSBURG

DEEP INTO THE 20S BY MORNING. 

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 205 PM...

THE MIDSOUTH WILL HAVE A PROLONGED PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER THIS WEEK...
SOMETHING WE CAN USE FOLLOWING THE RECENT SPELL OF EXCESSIVE RAIN.
HOWEVER...WE WILL HAVE TO PAY FOR IT IN THE FORM OF COLD
TEMPERATURES. ARCTIC HIGH WILL MOVE FROM THE NORTHERN ROCKIES TO
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS BY 12Z TUESDAY...THEN BE LOCATED SQUARELY OVER
THE MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY MORNING. SATELLITE SHOWS CLEAR SKIES ACROSS
THE MIDSOUTH WHICH WILL CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 850 MB
TEMPERATURES ARE FORECAST TO FALL TO ABOUT -8 C ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
12Z TUESDAY WITH HIGHS ON TUESDAY FORECAST TO BE ONLY IN THE 30S.
LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE IN THE LOWER 20S...BUT A WIND AROUND 10 MPH WILL
CAUSE WIND CHILLS EARLY TUESDAY MORNING TO RANGE FROM ABOUT 8 TO 14
DEGREES. LOWS WEDNESDAY MORNING WILL DROP INTO THE TEENS BUT WINDS
WILL BE NEAR CALM. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY
NIGHT. SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL ALLOW FOR SOME
WARNING DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. NO PRECIPITATION IS FORECAST WITH
THE FRONT. THE GULF WILL REMAIN SHUT OFF WITH 850 WINDS REMAINING
MOSTLY WESTERLY. DEEPER MOISTURE WILL REMAIN WELL TO OUR SOUTH ALONG
THE GULF COAST OR EVEN FURTHER SOUTH. IN ADDITION...THE ATMOSPHERE IS
FORECAST TO BE VERY STABLE.

THE LATEST GFS INDICATES A CLIPPER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING
NEAR THE NORTHEAST PART OF OUR CWA SUNDAY AND A DEEPENING EAST
COAST TROUGH. THIS COULD MEAN SOME LIGHT RAIN / SNOW ACROSS PARTS OF
THE MIDSOUTH. HOWEVER...THIS IS THE FIRST TIME MODELS HAVE

SURFACE COLD FRONT STRETCHED FROM WESTERN NY TO EAST TN ACROSS 
CENTRAL MS TO THE BIG BEND OF TX. THE VERY COLD AIR I.E. TEENS AND 
SINGLE DIGITS WAS LOCATED OVER MN...WI AND MI.

THE COLD AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE MID SOUTH TODAY...WITH THE COLDEST 
AIR MOVING INTO THE REGION TONIGHT. TUESDAY MAX TEMPS WILL ONLY 
REACH NEAR 40 DEGREES...WITH A VERY SLOW WARM UP AFTER ANOTHER VERY 
COLD NIGHT TUESDAY...ABOUT 10 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE.

THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK WILL SLOWLY SHIFT TO NEAR NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES INTO THE WEEKEND WITH NO PRECIPITATION EXPECTED. THE 
CURRENT FORECAST HANDLES THIS SCENARIO WELL AND ONLY MINOR CHANGES 
MADE. 

THE GENERAL UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL CONTINUE WITH A TROUGH OVER THE

OCCURRING OVER THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING. LOW CLOUDS AND SOME AREAS 
OF VERY LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE WERE MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. 

THE POWERFUL UPPER LOW RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CLOUDY...COOL WEATHER WAS 
SLOWLY MOVING INTO THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. THE TROUGH AXIS WILL SHIFT 
INTO EASTERN TN TODAY...TAKING MOST OF THE CLOUDS WITH IT. SO EXPECT 
SKIES TO BREAK UP FROM WEST TO EAST TODAY WITH AREAS ALONG THE TN 
RIVER AND MS/AL BORDER TO BREAK UP LAST...CLOSER TO LATE AFTERNOON. 
THIS WILL INHIBIT TEMPERATURES FROM WARMING UP TOO MUCH...MAINLY IN 
THE MID 40S NORTH AND NEAR 50 SOUTH. 

TONIGHT...A BATCH OF CIRRUS CLOUDS WILL STREAK OVER THE AREA CAUSING 
A TRICKY MIN TEMP FORECAST...IF THEY MATERIALIZE. HAVE GONE WITH 
SLIGHTLY WARMER MIN TEMPS FOR THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.

SUNDAY WILL BE UNEVENTFUL BUT WILL BE WARMER AHEAD OF THE 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. ANOTHER STRONG UPPER LOW WILL DROP OUT OF 
CANADA AND ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA EARLY SUNDAY EVENING. WINDS 
WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST AND TEMPS WILL FALL QUICKLY. THIS FRONT 
IS ACTUALLY STRONGER IN TERMS OF COLD AIR THAN THE LAST FRONT. 
HOWEVER ONE DIFFERENCE WILL BE THE LACK OF THICK STRATUS WITH 
FRONTAL PASSAGE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL BE A FACTOR IN MAX TEMPS 
MONDAY. WENT SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN CURRENT GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR 
MONDAY. THE COLD  AIR ADVECTION SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO OFFSET LACK OF 
CLOUD COVER.

AS THE TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE U.S. A

A DEEP 500 MB TROUGH WAS LOCATED OVER THE OH/TN VALLEYS THIS 
EVENING. STRONG LOW LEVEL CAA CONTS WITH 850 MB TEMPS DIPPING BLO 
ZERO THIS EVENING. COLD AIR STRATOCU WAS WIDESPREAD ACRS ALL OF THE 
MID SOUTH THIS EVENING. SFC TEMPS CONT TO DROP WITH READINGS 
CURRENTLY IN THE LOWER 40S WITH A GUSTY NW SFC WIND. CLOUDS AND WIND 
WL PREVENT TEMPS FROM DROPPING TOO FAR TONIGHT THOUGH IT WILL STILL 
SEEM QUITE CHILLY OUTSIDE. A BAND OF LIGHT SHOWERS FROM PARIS TN TO 
THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA WL CONT TO PUSH SE THROUGH THE EVENING. WL 
ALSO KEEP AN EYE ON ANOTHER BAND OF SHOWERS INVOF OF STL MOVING 
SOUTH ALONG THE MS RIVER. CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD WITH NO 
CHANGES ATTM.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 247 PM...

THE MIDSOUTH IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DEEP TROUGH WITH A CLOSED 
LOW LOCATED OVER ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. COLD AIR ADVECTION OCCURRING 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION WITH MODELS INDICATING 850MB TEMPS DIPPING 
DOWN TO -4/-5 BY 00Z..LEVELING OFF AFTERWARDS. COLD AIR STRATOCU NOW 
COVERING ENTIRE CWA AND EXPECT IT TO REMAIN OVER THE AREA THROUGHOUT 
THE NIGHT. ALSO BELIEVE WINDS WILL STAY UP TONIGHT AS THE GRADIENT 
WILL REMAIN STRONG BETWEEN THE LOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. WITH THE WINDS STAYING UP TONIGHT 
WITH CLOUDY SKIES...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN FAIRLY WELL MIXED AND 
TEMPERATURES WONT BE ABLE TO DROP TOO FAR. EXPECT MID TO UPPER 30S 
MOST LOCATIONS. A SHORTWAVE WILL ROUND THE CLOSED LOW TONIGHT AND 
MOVE SOUTH...THIS MAY PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT FOR A FEW 
SHOWERS...THEREFORE HAVE INCLUDED LOW END POPS FOR THE NORTH AND 
EAST PORTIONS OF THE CWA TONIGHT. NO WINTER PRECIP EXPECTED AS 
TEMPERATURES WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY COLD ENOUGH FOR ICE NUCLEI 
FORMATION.

SHORTWAVE OVER WESTERN CANADA WILL MOVE EAST AND SERVE TO KICK THE 
EASTERN TROUGH FURTHER EAST TOMORROW. THIS WILL ALLOW AN UPPER RIDGE 
TO NOSE INTO THE AREA. THEREFORE...SKIES ARE EXPECTED TO BEGIN 
CLEARING FROM WEST TO EAST...WITH MOST OF THE AREA BECOMING PARTLY 
CLOUDY BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WARM ADVECTION SETS UP BY LATE 
SATURDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE OVER WESTERN 
CANADA WHICH DIVES SOUTH INTO THE MIDWEST. IF WARM ADVECTION SETS UP 
EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED...THIS WILL CAUSE LOWS SUNDAY MORNING TO BE 
WARMER THAN CURRENTLY ADVERTISED. FEEL THAT LIGHT WINDS AND MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO GET BACK INTO 
THE 30S BEFORE WAA SETS UP. 

WARMER TEMPERATURES ARE IN ORDER FOR SUNDAY...BUT WILL BE SHORT 
LIVED AS THE SHORTWAVE PUSHES A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE 
AREA...BRINGING DOWN THE FIRST SHOT OF COLDER AIR. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE 
PUSHES THROUGH ON TUESDAY. THIS TIME A 1040MB ARCTIC HIGH FOLLOWS. 
THIS WILL LIKELY BRING THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON TO THE 
MIDSOUTH. WEDNESDAY MORNING LOOKS PARTICULARLY COLD WITH THE ARCTIC 
HIGH POSITIONED VERY CLOSE TO THE MIDSOUTH. FIRST TEENS OF THE 
SEASON LOOK VERY POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN AREAS. OF COURSE 
THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME TO MONITOR THIS POTENTIAL. LONG RANGE MODELS 
INDICATE THAT THE COLD WILL NOT BE GOING ANYWHERE QUICK AS ANOTHER 
REINFORCING TROUGH PUSHES THROUGH ON FRIDAY. NO PRECIP EXPECTED FOR 
THE WEEK.

EAST PORTIONS OF THE CWA TONIGHT. NO WINTER PRECIP EXPECTED AS 
TEMPERATURES WILL NOT BE SUFFICIENTLY COLD ENOUGH FOR ICE NUCLEI 
FORMATION.

SHORTWAVE OVER WESTERN CANADA WILL MOVE EAST AND SERVE TO KICK THE

CLEARING FROM WEST TO EAST...WITH MOST OF THE AREA BECOMING PARTLY 
CLOUDY BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WARM ADVECTION SETS UP BY LATE 
SATURDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE OVER WESTERN 
CANADA WHICH DIVES SOUTH INTO THE MIDWEST. IF WARM ADVECTION SETS UP 
EARLIER THAN ANTICIPATED...THIS WILL CAUSE LOWS SUNDAY MORNING TO BE 
WARMER THAN CURRENTLY ADVERTISED. FEEL THAT LIGHT WINDS AND MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO GET BACK INTO

WARMER TEMPERATURES ARE IN ORDER FOR SUNDAY...BUT WILL BE SHORT 
LIVED AS THE SHORTWAVE PUSHES A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE 
AREA...BRINGING DOWN THE FIRST SHOT OF COLDER AIR. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE 
PUSHES THROUGH ON TUESDAY. THIS TIME A 1040MB ARCTIC HIGH FOLLOWS. 
THIS WILL LIKELY BRING THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON TO THE 
MIDSOUTH. WEDNESDAY MORNING LOOKS PARTICULARLY COLD WITH THE ARCTIC 
HIGH POSITIONED VERY CLOSE TO THE MIDSOUTH. FIRST TEENS OF THE 
SEASON LOOK VERY POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN AREAS. OF COURSE 
THERE IS PLENTY OF TIME TO MONITOR THIS POTENTIAL. LONG RANGE MODELS 
INDICATE THAT THE COLD WILL NOT BE GOING ANYWHERE QUICK AS ANOTHER

THE MIDSOUTH IS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DEEP TROUGH WITH A CLOSED 
LOW LOCATED OVER ILLINOIS AND INDIANA. COLD AIR ADVECTION OCCURRING 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION WITH MODELS INDICATING 850MB TEMPS DIPPING 
DOWN TO -4/-5 BY 00Z..LEVELING OFF AFTERWARDS. COLD AIR STRATOCU NOW

IMPRESSIVE MID/UPPER LOW SPINNING NEAR THE GREAT LAKES REGION THIS 
MORNING. A SHORTWAVE LOCATED OVER SOUTHWESTERN MO WILL ROTATE INTO 
THE MID SOUTH LATER THIS MORNING. THIS WILL PRODUCE AT LEAST A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. POSSIBLY A RUMBLE OF THUNDER OVER EASTERN AREAS ALONG 
THE TN RIVER. LOW CLOUDS CAN BE SEEN RACING INTO CENTRAL MO THIS 
MORNING. THESE ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA AROUND NOON.

PREVIOUS FORECAST HAD A GOOD HANDLE ON MAX TEMPERATURES TODAY WITH 
INCREASING CLOUDS...WINDS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION. APPEARS THAT MAX  
TEMP WILL OCCUR BY EARLY AFTERNOON...BEFORE THE LOW CLOUDS ARRIVE. 

THE UPPER LOW TRANSLATES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT WITH ANOTHER 
SHORTWAVE ROUNDING THE BASE. HAVE ONLY ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT 
RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN FORECAST AREA. CLOUDS AND WINDS WILL 
LIKELY HINDER REALLY COOL MIN TEMPS. THUS HAVE RAISED THE LOWS ABOUT 
5 DEGREES IN ALL AREAS. 

BY SATURDAY NIGHT THE LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL BE POSITIONED ALONG THE 
EAST COAST. EXPECT CLEARING SKIES FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY. THE UPPER AIR PATTERN BEGINS TO 
FLATTEN OUT SUNDAY AND MONDAY GETTING INTO NORTHWEST FLOW. AN UPPER 
LOW SWINGING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES WILL BRING A COLD FRONT 
INTO THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL USHER IN MUCH COOLER AIR 
INTO THE REGION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. NO PRECIPITATION IS 
EXPECTED WITH THIS FRONT.

AMPLIFIED PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO TAKE SHAPE TONIGHT AS THE EASTERN 
U.S. TROUGH BEGINS TO DEEPEN AND THE WEST COAST RIDGE STRENGTHENS. A 
SHORTWAVE WILL QUICKLY DIVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH LATE TONIGHT...WHICH 
WILL SERVE TO AMPLIFY THE TROUGH AND PRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN 
OVER THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH. ANY RAIN THAT DOES OCCUR 
SHOULD BE LIGHT GIVEN THE LIMITED MOISTURE AVAILABLE. WITH THE 
LONGWAVE PATTERN AMPLIFYING...THE SURFACE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN OVER 
THE REGION AS LOW PRESSURE DEEPENS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES. THIS WILL ALLOW THE 
WINDS TO PICK UP LATE TONIGHT.

FRIDAY IS SHAPING UP TO BE A COLD...CLOUDY...AND WINDY DAY. FLOW 
TURNS NORTHWESTERLY AT ALL LEVELS...ALLOWING FOR STRONG COLD AIR 
ADVECTION. 850MB TEMPS WILL DROP AROUND 8 DEGREES TOMORROW AS 40 TO 
45 KTS OF 850MB WINDS PUMP IN THE COLD AIR. HIGH TEMPS WILL LIKELY 
OCCUR IN THE MORNING WITH TEMPS FALLING DURING THE AFTERNOON. 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL ROUND THE TROUGH TOMORROW AFTERNOON. PUT 
CHANCE POPS IN NE ZONES WHERE THE BEST MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND 
MOISTURE WILL BE. ANY RAIN THAT DOES DEVELOP SHOULD BE LIGHT...SO 
NOT EXPECTING ANY HIGH RAINFALL TOTALS. 

CAA WILL CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY NIGHT. THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH 
MOISTURE IN PLACE ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER FOR A CHANCE OF 
SPRINKLES. MODEL SOUNDINGS DO SHOW THAT EXTREME NE AREAS MAY GET 
COLD ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW FLURRIES BEFORE THE DRIER AIR FILTERS 
IN. AS A RESULT...WILL LEAVE A MENTION OF SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES IN 
THE NE ZONES. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SPRINKLES ARE POSSIBLE ELSEWHERE 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CWA.

THINGS DRY OUT AND CLEAR OUT FOR SATURDAY WITH TEMPERATURES ON THE 
COOL SIDE. BRIEF SHOT OF WARM AIR ADVECTION OVERNIGHT SATURDAY INTO 
SUNDAY IN ADVANCE OF ANOTHER COLD FRONT. COLD FRONT CLEARS THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
650 AM CST THU DEC 9 2004

DISCUSSION...RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH TROUGH HAS MOVED OFF TO THE EAST 
AND ISSUED AN UPDATE TO REMOVE PRECIPITATION FROM THE FORECAST FOR 
TODAY AND TO CANCEL FLOOD WATCH.

UPDATED GRIDS ALREADY PUBLISHED.

CJC

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 400 AM CST THU DEC 9 2004.

.SHORT TERM...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING PLACES A 
STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS CENTRAL/SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND 
LOUISIANA. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWING UPPER LEVEL LOW ACROSS 
CENTRAL TEXAS...WHICH 00Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS DID NOT ANALYZE WELL. 
LATEST 88D RADAR TRENDS SHOWING QUITE A BIT OF RAIN FALLING ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR 
TODAY WILL BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES.

MID LEVEL FORCING WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE OFF TO THE NORTHEAST THIS 
MORNING. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW PRECIPITATION WILL GRADUALLY BEGIN TO 
COME TO AN END ACROSS MOST AREAS THIS MORNING WITH SOUTHEAST 
SECTIONS NOT SEEING RAIN DIMINISH UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. PRECIPITABLE 
WATER VALUES CURRENTLY ARE AROUND 1.5 INCHES BUT SHOULD START TO 
DIMINISH AS MAIN AREA OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS MOVES 
OFF TO THE EAST. 3 HOUR RAINFALL ESTIMATES FROM KNQA HAVE SHOWN UP TO 2.5 
INCHES OF RAIN HAS FALLEN ACROSS PANOLA...LAFAYETTE...AND 
TALLAHATCHIE COUNTIES IN NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. AS A RESULT I WILL 
KEEP FLOOD WATCH GOING IN MISSISSIPPI ALONG AND EAST OF THIS 
AREA...INCLUDING A PORTION OF TENNESSEE...AND WILL DROP FLOOD WATCH 
FOR AREAS WEST. 

LONG TERM...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL MOVE EAST OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS AND DIG IN ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. THIS 
WILL RESULT IN A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS AND REINFORCING SHOTS OF COOLER AIR THROUGH NEXT WEEK.

TONIGHT...ANOTHER LOBE OF ENERGY WILL ROTATE AROUND UPPER LEVEL LOW 
CENTERED ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN IOWA. 305K ISENTROPIC SURFACE SHOWS 
DECENT ASCENT AT LEAST THROUGH MIDNIGHT ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS 
AND WESTERN TENNESSEE. HOWEVER THE ETA IS TOO DRY WITH THE SHORTWAVE 
PASSAGE AND GFS TOO WET. THAT SAID...I WILL GO WITH SLIGHTLY DRIER 
VERSION OF THE GFS...SCATTERED POPS NORTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE DOWN TO 
MS/TN BORDER.

FRIDAY...UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL SLIDE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT RAIN WILL LINGER AT LEAST THROUGH EARLY 
AFTERNOON ACROSS ARKANSAS AND TENNESSEE...AND WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS 
IN FOR THE MORNING. HIGHS WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 
50S ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS 850 MB TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO AROUND 
-1C BY AFTERNOON.

FRIDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE ROTATING AROUND UPPER LEVEL LOW 
WILL SWING THROUGH THE LOWER/MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. PARTIAL 
THICKNESSES ALONG WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST ANY PRECIPITATION 
THAT FALLS ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA COULD 
BE IN THE FORM OF RAIN OR SNOW WITH A DECENT LAYER OF COLD AIR 
ASSOCIATED WITH COLD POOL ALOFT. HOWEVER...MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW 
MOISTURE WILL BE QUITE LIMITED AND CONSEQUENTLY WILL ONLY MENTION A 
CHANCE OF FLURRIES OR SPRINKLES. 

SATURDAY...DRY AIR WILL FINALLY WORK BACK INTO THE MID SOUTH. 
1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S WILL DROP TO AROUND 50 PERCENT AS UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING TRIES TO WORK ITS WAY INTO THE REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
SOMEWHAT SIMILAR TO FRIDAY.

SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...NO SURPRISES IN EXTENDED AS GFS AND 
EUROPEAN HAVE SUGGESTED MUCH COLDER AIR FILTERING INTO THE MID SOUTH 
BY MONDAY AND TUESDAY WITH THE AREA REMAINING PRECIPITATION FREE 
WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVERHEAD. ONLY CHANGES WILL BE TO LOWER 
TEMPERATURES A BIT AS EACH PROGRESSIVE MODEL RUN HAS BEEN COLDER.

.SHORT TERM...SURFACE AND UPPER AIR ANALYSIS SHOW HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF 
CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. TEMPERATURES SO FAR THIS MORNING 
ARE IN THE 30S TO LOWER 40S. HIGHS TODAY WILL BE A FEW DEGREES 
COOLER THAN YESTERDAY WITH 850 MB TEMPERATURES HOVERING AROUND 9-10C.
NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF CLOUD COVER EXCEPT FOR SOME 
SCATTERED CIRRUS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

LONG TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...ONLY PRECIPITATION CHANCES 
THROUGH THE LONG TERM WILL BE WITH THE WEAK SHORTWAVE ROTATING 
THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT.

TONIGHT...SKIES WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY TONIGHT AS A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS THE LOWER/MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. BEST MID 
LEVEL FORCING /700-500 MB Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE/ ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA WILL COME AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS SIMILAR TO LAST 
NIGHTS 0Z RUN WITH QUITE A BIT OF DRY AIR ACROSS PORTIONS OF 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. BEST CHANCES FOR RAINFALL AMOUNTS NEAR AN INCH 
OVERNIGHT WILL BE IN THE SOUTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA 
WITH LESSER AMOUNTS NORTH. CURRENT POPS IN GRIDS HANDLING 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WELL AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES. 

THURSDAY...MID LEVEL FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE 
WILL MOVE OFF TO THE EAST BY MID DAY...AND WILL TAPER POPS OFF AS 
THE DAY PROGRESSES. 1000-500 MB LAYER RH WILL DROP DOWN TO 40 
PERCENT ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE AFTERNOON AND WILL 
GO WITH A DECREASE IN CLOUD COVER DURING THE DAY.  

FRIDAY...UPPER LEVEL LOW DROPS OUT OF MANITOBA AND INTO THE MIDDLE 
MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEYS. MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS WILL SLIDE ACROSS 
THE AREA BUT NOT EXPECTING ANY RAIN WITH THIS SYSTEM AS MOISTURE 
WILL BE QUITE LIMITED. HOWEVER...TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT COOLER 
WITH 1000-500MB PARTIAL THICKNESSES DROPPING TO AROUND 540 DM AND 
850 MB TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO AROUND -1/-2C. MODEL GUIDANCE SEEMS 
TO BE A BIT HIGH AND WILL GO WITH A COOLER VERSION OF THE MAV 
GUIDANCE WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 50S. LOWS FRIDAY NIGHT 
WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 30S ACROSS THE REGION.

SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL BRING A SERIES 
OF FRONTS THROUGH THE EASTERN U.S. ABOUT EVERY OTHER DAY. MODEL 
DIFFERENCES GFS IS A BIT SLOWER THAN EUROPEAN...ESPECIALLY BY DAY 6 
AND DAY 7. NONETHELESS...PRECIPITATION CHANCES LOOK SLIM TO NONE AND 
WILL KEEP LONG RANGE DRY AS CURRENT GRIDS ADVERTISE. ONLY MADE 
SLIGHT TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS TO EXTENDED TO REFLECT COOLER AIR 
THAT WILL TRY TO AFFECT THE MID SOUTH BY EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...

AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS
EVENING AND TONIGHT WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER. A VIGOROUS
UPPER SHORT WAVE OVER THE TEXAS PANHANDLE EARLY THIS EVENING WILL
MOVE EASTWARD TO EASTERN OKLAHOMA BY MIDNIGHT AND BECOME NEGATIVELY
TILTED. IT WILL THEN SWING NORTHEASTWARD TO ILLINOIS BY 6AM TUESDAY.
THE NEGATIVE TILT WILL INCREASE UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE IN THE
FAVORABLE RIGHT REAR ENTRANCE REGION OF THE 300MB JET AND IN A
DESTABILIZING ATMOSPHERE. THIS WILL PROVIDE INCREASING UPLIFT IN THE
MID AND UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

A DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN PLANES WILL INTENSIFY AS
IT MOVES NORTHEASTWARD THIS EVENING. THIS WILL CAUSE A WARM FRONT TO
MOVE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE MID SOUTH EARLY THIS EVENING. INCREASING
SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL THEN BRING WARMER AND MORE MOIST AIR ACROSS THE
REGION THROUGH TONIGHT.

SURFACE DEW POINTS WILL INCREASE TO THE UPPER 60S WITH 850MB DEW
POINTS INCREASING TO 12 DEG C IN THE WARM SECTOR AHEAD OF THE
INTENSIFYING LOW.

THE RESULT WILL BE SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THAT WILL BECOME WIDESPREAD THIS EVENING AND
CONTINUE THR0UGH TONIGHT. THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER
ACROSS THE ENTIRE MID SOUTH TONIGHT. THUNDERSTORMS WITH DAMAGING
STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND ISOLATED TORNADOES ARE
POSSIBLE. THE GREATEST THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE FROM ABOUT
8PM THIS EVENING TO 4AM TUESDAY MORNING.

HEAVY RAINFALL IS ALSO EXPECTED WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF FLASH
FLOODING AND RIVER FLOODING. THEREFORE A FLOOD WATCH IS IN EFFECT
FOR THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH THIS EVENING THROUGH 6 AM TUESDAY MORNING.

THE UPPER WAVE WILL CONTINUE NORTHEASTWARD TO THE GREAT LAKES AND
CLOSE OFF TUESDAY. IN ITS WAKE WILL BE ZONAL FLOW TUESDAY NIGHT AND
WEDNESDAY. SHORT WAVES WILL CARVE A TROF OVER THE CENTRAL STATES
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. MEANWHILE A RIDGE WILL BUILD IN THE
WEST. THE TROF WILL SHIFT TO THE EASTERN STATES AS THE RIDGE SPREADS
EASTWARD TO THE CENTRAL PLAINS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

AT THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING COOLER AND DRIER AIR INTO THE
REGION TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. A LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL DEVELOP OVER
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND BRING THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN TO THE
MID SOUTH THURSDAY.

AREAS OF DENSE FOG HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST
ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL THIS MORNING. HAVE DECIDED TO
ISSUE A DENSE FOG ADVISORY THAT WILL RUN THROUGH 15Z TO ACCOUNT FOR
VISIBILITIES BELOW 1/4 MILE. THE FOG SHOULD BEGIN TO LIFT AFTER 15Z.

A VERY ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IS SETTING UP ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH...
WITH SEVERE WEATHER EXPECTED ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE AREA LATER THIS
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT
SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. THIS MORNING. THIS STRONG
SHORTWAVE IS FORECAST BY THE OPERATIONAL MODELS TO QUICKLY EJECT
OUT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
THROUGH TONIGHT. THIS TROUGH WILL BECOME NEGATIVELY TILTED AS IT
LIFTS NORTHEASTWARD HELPING TO AID IN LARGE SCALE ASCENT LATE THIS
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT AS COOLING MID-LEVEL TEMPERATURES SPREAD OVER
PORTIONS OF THE LOW LEVEL WARM SECTOR THAT WILL BE IN PLACE ACROSS
OUR AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON. A STRONG 130 KT UPPER LEVEL JET WILL
EJECT OUT OF THE BASE OF THE TROUGH LATER TODAY...PLACING MOST OF THE
MIDSOUTH IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET...WHICH WILL ALSO
AID IN UPLIFT.

AT THE SURFACE...AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE HAS DEVELOPED OVER SOUTHWEST
KANSAS WITH A WARM FRONT EXTENDING EAST ACROSS CENTRAL ARKANSAS AND
NORTH MISSISSIPPI THIS MORNING. AS THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES
NORTHEAST ACROSS KANSAS AND MISSOURI LATER TODAY...IT WILL PULL THE
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY NORTHWARD ACROSS THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL
ALLOW A WARM...MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS TO SPILL OVER THE ENTIRE
AREA...WITH CAPES FORECAST IN EXCESS OF 1000 J/KG. WIND SHEAR WILL
ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT...WITH 0-3 KM HELICITY VALUES RANGING FROM 300-
500 M2/S2 AND 0-1 KM HELICITY IN EXCESS OF 200 M2/S2. BASED ON THESE
SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS...EXPECTING SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS TO BE
POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY TONIGHT...WITH DAMAGING
WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND TORNADOES POSSIBLE. SPC HAS OUTLOOKED THE
AREA FOR A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT. EXPECT MODE OF CONVECTION TO TRANSITION INTO A SQUALL-LINE
LATE TONIGHT...WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADO
POSSIBILITIES CONTINUING. ONCE THE SQUALL-LINE ADVANCES EAST
THROUGH THE AREA...EXPECT AN END TO THE RAIN AND SEVERE WEATHER
CHANCES.

HEAVY RAIN WILL ALSO BE A THREAT TODAY AND TONIGHT...SO HAVE ISSUED
FLASH FLOOD WATCHES TO COVER THIS POSSIBILITY.

THE COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP EAST ACROSS THE AREA ON TUESDAY...WITH
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN AND BRINGING DRIER WEATHER FOR TUESDAY
AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...A WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL PASS THROUGH
THE MID SOUTH ON THURSDAY PRODUCING A CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS THROUGH
FRIDAY MORNING. MID LEVEL RIDGING WILL BRING DRY WEATHER FOR THE
THE WEEKEND. LATEST GFS RUN SUGGESTS ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL

...SEVERE WEATHER AND HEAVY RAINFALL LIKELY ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH
LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...

.DISCUSSION...
AREAS OF DENSE FOG HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST
ARKANSAS AND THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL THIS MORNING. HAVE DECIDED TO
ISSUE A DENSE FOG ADVISORY THAT WILL RUN THROUGH 15Z TO ACCOUNT FOR
VISIBILITIES BELOW 1/4 MILE. THE FOG SHOULD BEGIN TO LIFT AFTER 15Z.

A VERY ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IS SETTING UP ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH...
WITH SEVERE WEATHER EXPECTED ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE AREA LATER THIS
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT
SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. THIS MORNING. THIS STRONG
SHORTWAVE IS FORECAST BY THE OPERATIONAL MODELS TO QUICKLY EJECT
OUT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
THROUGH TONIGHT. THIS TROUGH WILL BECOME NEGATIVELY TILTED AS IT
LIFTS NORTHEASTWARD HELPING TO AID IN LARGE SCALE ASCENT LATE THIS
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT AS COOLING MID-LEVEL TEMPERATURES SPREAD OVER
PORTIONS OF THE LOW LEVEL WARM SECTOR THAT WILL BE IN PLACE ACROSS
OUR AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON. A STRONG 130 KT UPPER LEVEL JET WILL
EJECT OUT OF THE BASE OF THE TROUGH LATER TODAY...PLACING MOST OF THE
MIDSOUTH IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET...WHICH WILL ALSO
AID IN UPLIFT.

AT THE SURFACE...AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE HAS DEVELOPED OVER SOUTHWEST
KANSAS WITH A WARM FRONT EXTENDING EAST ACROSS CENTRAL ARKANSAS AND
NORTH MISSISSIPPI THIS MORNING. AS THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES
NORTHEAST ACROSS KANSAS AND MISSOURI LATER TODAY...IT WILL PULL THE
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY NORTHWARD ACROSS THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL
ALLOW A WARM...MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS TO SPILL OVER THE ENTIRE
AREA...WITH CAPES FORECAST IN EXCESS OF 1000 J/KG. WIND SHEAR WILL
ALSO BE SIGNIFICANT...WITH 0-3 KM HELICITY VALUES RANGING FROM 300-
500 m2/s2 AND 0-1 KM HELICITY IN EXCESS OF 200 m2/s2. BASED ON THESE
SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS...EXPECTING SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS TO BE
POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY TONIGHT...WITH DAMAGING
WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND TORNADOES POSSIBLE. SPC HAS OUTLOOKED THE
AREA FOR A MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT. EXPECT MODE OF CONVECTION TO TRANSITION INTO A SQUALL-LINE
LATE TONIGHT...WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADO
POSSIBILITIES CONTINUING. ONCE THE SQUALL-LINE ADVANCES EAST
THROUGH THE AREA...EXPECT AN END TO THE RAIN AND SEVERE WEATHER
CHANCES.

HEAVY RAIN WILL ALSO BE A THREAT TODAY AND TONIGHT...SO HAVE ISSUED
FLASH FLOOD WATCHES TO COVER THIS POSSIBILITY.

THE COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP EAST ACROSS THE AREA ON TUESDAY...WITH
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN AND BRINGING DRIER WEATHER FOR TUESDAY
AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...A WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL PASS THROUGH
THE MID SOUTH ON THURSDAY PRODUCING A CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS THROUGH
FRIDAY MORNING. MID LEVEL RIDGING WILL BRING DRY WEATHER FOR THE
THE WEEKEND. LATEST GFS RUN SUGGESTS ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL
PASS THROUGH THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...BUT WILL LEAVE
DRY FOR NOW AS LATEST 00Z MODEL RUNS OF GFS/EUROPEAN DIVERGE BEYOND
FRIDAY WITH FRONTAL POSITIONING ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES.

STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS OVER THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE. A WARM 
FRONT EXTENDS SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH THE ARKLATEX REGION INTO 
SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI. A COLD FRONT EXTENDS SOUTHWARD FROM CENTRAL 
OKLAHOMA INTO CENTRAL TEXAS. THE FIRST MAIN BATCH OF RAIN IS MAINLY 
OUT OF THE REGION. THERE IS STILL SOME LIGHT RAIN AROUND IN RESPONSE 
TO UPPER JET DYNAMICS IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. WITH REGIONAL RADAR 
SHOWING FURTHER DEVELOPMENT OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...THOSE AREAS DRY 
AT THE MOMENT MAY STILL HAVE A THREAT FOR RAIN THROUGHOUT THE 
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. REMOVED THE THUNDER MENTION WITH NO 
LIGHTNING STRIKES IN THE VICINITY AND ATMOSPHERE LOOKS RELATIVELY 
STABLE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. REGION IS IN GOOD WARM AIR 
ADVECTION AND AS EXPECTED MANY LOCATIONS HAVE ALREADY HAD THEIR LOWS 
FOR THE NIGHT AND CAN EXPECT STEADY OR RISING TEMPS THROUGHOUT THE 
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVING NORTHWARD TONIGHT. RAIN WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE WIDESPREAD UNTIL FRONT MOVES THROUGH. THERE MAY BE A 
FEW EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE RAIN. WILL GO CATEGORICAL POPS. 
EXPECT LOW TEMPERATURES TO OCCUR EARLY IN THE EVENING AS 
TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY RISE DURING THE NIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT.  
AFTER MIDNIGHT...EXPECT WIDESPREAD RAIN TO BEGIN TO DIMINISH 
ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA AS THE AREA WILL 
MOVE INTO A DRY SLOT. WILL TAPER POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT.

ON MONDAY...AREA WILL BE REMAIN IN DRY SLOT THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. 
EXPECT THE SUN TO BREAK THROUGH THE CLOUDS DURING THE MORNING. ANY 
SUNSHINE WILL HELP MAKE THE ATMOSPHERE UNSTABLE. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
GET TO 70 DEGREES TOMORROW WITH THE PEAKS OF SUN. EXPECT SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO BEGIN TO DEVELOP BY LATE AFTERNOON ACROSS 
SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT 
AND STRONG SHORTWAVE.

MONDAY NIGHT...SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER EVENT LOOKS LIKELY MONDAY 
EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. ETA AND GFS ARE COMING CLOSER TO 
THE SAME SOLUTION WITH ALL THE INGREDIENTS ARE COMING TOGETHER AHEAD 
OF A STRONG SHORTWAVE AND COLD FRONT. A LOT OF WARM MOIST AIR AND 
UPWARD MOTION WILL HELP SET OFF NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MONDAY EVENING. DEWPOINTS WILL GET INTO THE MID 60S DURING THIS 
TIME. IN ADDITION...THE MIDSOUTH WILL MOVE INTO THE REAR ENTRANCE 
REGION OF AN 120 KT UPPER LEVEL JET. A STRONG 60 KT LOW LEVEL JET 
WILL BE ALSO IN PLACE OVER THE AREA. HELICITY VALUES WILL BE AROUND 
400 M2/S2 WITH CAPE VALUES 500-1000 J/KG. ANY OF THE STORMS THAT 
DEVELOP HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF BECOMING SEVERE WITH ISOLATED 
TORNADOES AND DAMAGING WINDS. SPC HAS ENTIRE MIDSOUTH IN SLIGHT RISK 
IN LATEST DAY 2 OUTLOOK. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL ALSO BE A MAJOR CONCERN 
MONDAY NIGHT. GROUND IS SATURATED FROM RECENT RAINS SO ANY HEAVY 
DOWNPOURS FROM THUNDERSTORMS COULD CAUSE FLASH FLOODING AND RIVER 
FLOODING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. WILL ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR MONDAY 
NIGHT FOR THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH.

ON TUESDAY...COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVING THROUGH EASTERN 
PORTIONS OF THE CWA. WILL LEAVE POPS FOR ENTIRE MIDSOUTH THROUGH 
NOON AND MAYBE EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA DURING THE 
AFTERNOON. SKIES WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR BEHIND THE FRONT. TEMPERATURES 
WILL COOL OFF BEHIND THE FRONT.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND

CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS GENERALLY ON TRACK THIS MORNING. MID AND

FLOW ALOFT...AS EXPECTED. RADARS SHOWING SOME ECHOES APPROACHING
EAST-CENTRAL AR AND NORTH MS...BUT PROBABLY NOT REACHING THE
GROUND YET WITH NOTHING BEING REPORTED BY SURFACE OBSERVATIONS.

IN THE UPCOMING FORECAST...WILL MAKE ONLY A FEW CHANGES AS
LATEST MODELS SUPPORT OUR CURRENT FORECAST OVERALL. WILL SPLIT
TODAYS FORECAST INTO THIS MORNING AND THIS AFTERNOON...SLOWING
THE ARRIVAL OF THE RAIN TODAY ESPECIALLY FOR NORTHEASTERN AREAS OF
WEST TN. WILL INCREASE THE POPS FOR THIS EVENING AS THE FIRST
AREA OF WIDESPREAD RAIN WITH BE A LITTLE SLOWER IN MOVING OUT.
WILL ADD MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN TO THE FORECAST FOR
MONDAY NIGHT. IN ADDITION...WILL INCREASE POPS SOME FOR TUESDAY
MORNING ESPECIALLY FROM THE SOUTHEASTERN CORNER OF WEST TN INTO
NORTHEAST MS...AS MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A SLOWER COLD FRONTAL
MOVEMENT.

MODELS INDICATE WIDESPREAD RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD THE MIDSOUTH TODAY
AS A WARM FRONT BEGINS TO LIFT NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF COAST. A
SHORT WAVE OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. WILL MOVE INTO THE CENTRAL
PLAINS BY 00Z. THINK THE RAIN WILL COVER THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH BY
LATER THIS AFTERNOON...WILL JUST BE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN EARLIER
FORECAST INDICATED. IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO MOISTEN THE LOWER
LEVELS AS SURFACE DEWPOINTS REMAIN LOW. NEVERTHELESS...GOOD WARM
AIR ADVECTION ALOFT AND EXCELLENT MOISTURE INFLUX WILL LEAD TO
WIDESPREAD RAIN DEVELOPING TODAY...SPREADING INTO NORTH MS AND EAST-
CENTRAL AR EARLY TODAY THEN MOVING NORTHEASTWARD.

THE WARM FRONT WILL GRADUALLY LIFT NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH BY
MONDAY PLACING US IN A MOIST...UNSTABLE...AND WARM AIR MASS. SPC
STILL INDICATES A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER MONDAY AFTERNOON AND
MONDAY NIGHT FOR THE MIDSOUTH. SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH
THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT / TUESDAY PRECEDED BY SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. ETA INDICATES CAPES INCREASING TO BETWEEN 1000
AND 1500 J/KG ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY AFTERNOON AS
SURFACE TEMPERATURES CLIMB TO NEAR 70 AND DEWPOINTS INTO THE 60S...
ALTHOUGH CAPE VALUES DECREASE TO 600 J/KG OR LESS MONDAY EVENING.
HELICITY VALUES ACTUALLY BECOME THE BEST MONDAY NIGHT AS LOW LEVEL
WINDS BACK SOME IN RESPONSE TO A SURFACE LOW MOVING THROUGH MO.
DEPENDING ON RATHER THE INSTABILITY AND SHEAR CAN COME TOGETHER JUST
RIGHT WILL DETERMINE HOW MUCH SEVERE WEATHER WE HAVE...BUT THE
POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IS THERE. ALSO THINK HEAVY RAIN
COULD BE A PROBLEM MONDAY NIGHT AS A BAND OF THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPS
AHEAD OF THE FRONT. WILL ADD LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN TO THE GRIDS /
FORECAST...BUT SINCE THIS IS THE FOURTH PERIOD WILL DEFER ANY FLOOD
WATCHES TO LATER SHIFTS.

THE RAINY WEATHER SHOULD COME TO AN END...TEMPORARILY...BY TUESDAY
AFTERNOON AS DRIER AIR ADVECTS IN BEHIND THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD
FRONT. THE LATEST GFS INDICATES THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN ARRIVING
THURSDAY AS A UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

PLAINS BY 00Z. THINK THE RAIN WILL COVER THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH BY
LATER THIS AFTERNOON...WILL JUST BE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN EARLIER
FORECAST INDICATED. IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO MOISTEN THE LOWER
LEVELS AS SURFACE DEWPOINTS REMAIN LOW. NEVERTHELESS...GOOD WARM
AIR ADVECTION ALOFT AND EXCELLENT MOISTURE INFLUX WILL LEAD TO
WIDESPREAD RAIN DEVELOPING TODAY...SPREADING INTO NORTH MS AND EAST-
CENTRAL AR EARLY TODAY THEN MOVING NORTHEASTWARD.

THE WARM FRONT WILL GRADUALLY LIFT NORTH OF THE MIDSOUTH BY
MONDAY PLACING US IN A MOIST...UNSTABLE...AND WARM AIR MASS. SPC
STILL INDICATES A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER MONDAY AFTERNOON AND
MONDAY NIGHT FOR THE MIDSOUTH. SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH
THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT / TUESDAY PRECEDED BY SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. ETA INDICATES CAPES INCREASING TO BETWEEN 1000
AND 1500 J/KG ACROSS PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY AFTERNOON AS
SURFACE TEMPERATURES CLIMB TO NEAR 70 AND DEWPOINTS INTO THE 60S...
ALTHOUGH CAPE VALUES DECREASE TO 600 J/KG OR LESS MONDAY EVENING.
HELICITY VALUES ACTUALLY BECOME THE BEST MONDAY NIGHT AS LOW LEVEL
WINDS BACK SOME IN RESPONSE TO A SURFACE LOW MOVING THROUGH MO.
DEPENDING ON RATHER THE INSTABILITY AND SHEAR CAN COME TOGETHER JUST
RIGHT WILL DETERMINE HOW MUCH SEVERE WEATHER WE HAVE...BUT THE
POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IS THERE. ALSO THINK HEAVY RAIN
COULD BE A PROBLEM MONDAY NIGHT AS A BAND OF THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPS
AHEAD OF THE FRONT. WILL ADD LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN TO THE GRIDS /
FORECAST...BUT SINCE THIS IS THE FOURTH PERIOD WILL DEFER ANY FLOOD
WATCHES TO LATER SHIFTS.

THE RAINY WEATHER SHOULD COME TO AN END...TEMPORARILY...BY TUESDAY
AFTERNOON AS DRIER AIR ADVECTS IN BEHIND THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD
FRONT. THE LATEST GFS INDICATES THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN ARRIVING
THURSDAY AS A UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN CONTROL OF THE WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON 
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. THIS HAS BROUGHT THE MIDSOUTH A BEAUTIFUL SUNNY 
DAY. HOWEVER THE QUIET WEATHER WILL BE COMING TO AN END BY MORNING. 
EXPECT CLEAR SKIES TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS BEFORE 
CLOUDS BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE CWA FROM THE SOUTH AHEAD OF A WARM 
FRONT. THE WARM FRONT IS CURRENTLY LOCATED ALONG THE GULF COAST AND 
WILL BEGIN PUSHING NORTHWARD OVERNIGHT. RAIN AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL 
MOVE INTO EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH BY MORNING. WILL 
ONLY MENTION A 20 POP IN EXTREME SOUTHERN ZONES...LEAVING THE REST 
OF THE MIDSOUTH DRY OVERNIGHT. WITH CLOUD COVER...LOW TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE MUCH WARMER THAN PREVIOUS NIGHTS. LOWS WILL ONLY FALL INTO 
TO THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S.

DURING THE DAY SUNDAY...RAIN WILL SPREAD OVER THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH BY 
AFTERNOON AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING WARM FRONT. EXPECT MOST LOCATIONS 
TO RECEIVE A HALF INCH TO AN INCH OF RAIN WITH THIS INITIAL SHOT OF 
RAIN. RAIN SHOULD COME DOWN PRETTY STEADY SO GROUND SHOULD BE ABLE 
TO HOLD IT EVEN WITH THE RECENT RAINS SO NO FLOOD WATCH WILL BE 
ISSUED...BUT RIVERS WILL NEED TO BE MONITOR FOR ANY POTENTIAL RIVER 
FLOODING.

BY SUNDAY NIGHT THE WARM FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE CWA BRINGING 
THE ENTIRE AREA IN THE WARM SECTOR. BEHIND THE FRONT...A DRY SLOT 
WILL MOVE OVER THE AREA DIMINISHING HIGH CHANCES FOR RAIN. SOME 
SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA COULD STILL DEVELOP SO WILL LEAVE CHANCE POPS. 
THIS DRY SLOT WILL STAY OVER THE AREA MOST OF THE DAY MONDAY. THIS 
WILL ALLOW FOR SUNSHINE TO BREAK THROUGH THE CLOUDS AND WILL HELP 
MAKE THE ATMOSPHERE UNSTABLE AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND 
STRONG SHORTWAVE. BY LATE AFTERNOON...EXPECT SHRA/TSRA TO BEGIN TO 
BREAK OUT OVER SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA AHEAD OF THE 
APPROACHING SYSTEM. OTHERWISE MOST OF THE DAY WILL BE DRY.

SEVERE WEATHER IS LOOKING MORE LIKELY ON MONDAY NIGHT AS THE STRONG 
SHORTWAVE AND COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. ETA AND GFS 
DIFFER ON POSITION OF SFC LOW WHICH MAKES A DIFFERENCE ON IF THE 
ENTIRE MIDSOUTH WILL SEE THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER(THE ETA) 
OR ONLY PORTIONS OF THE AREA WILL SEE IT(THE GFS). RIGHT NOW THE ETA 
HAS BEEN MORE CONSISTENT AND THE GFS SEEMS TO BE COMING CLOSER TO 
THE ETA SOLUTION WITH EVERY MODEL RUN SO WILL LEAN TOWARD ETA.  THE 
MIDSOUTH WILL MOVE INTO THE REAR ENTRANCE REGION OF A 125 KT UPPER 
LEVEL JET MONDAY EVENING. STRONG UPWARD MOTION AND A 60 KNOT LOW 
LEVEL JET WILL HELP SET OFF NUMEROUS SHRA/TSRA. HELICITY VALUES WILL 
BE AROUND 400 M2/S2. CAPE VALUES WILL RANGE FROM 500-1000 J/KG WITH 
THIS BEING DECEMBER THIS SHOULD HELP PRODUCE SEVERE STORMS. ISOLATED 
TORNADOES AND DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT FROM THESE 
STORMS. SPC HAS PUT A SLIGHT RISK OVER THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH IN THE 
LATEST DAY 3 OUTLOOK. HEAVY RAINFALL MAY ALSO BE AN ISSUE MONDAY 
NIGHT SO FLOODING MAY BE A CONCERN DURING THIS TIME.

ON TUESDAY...SHRA/TSRA WILL LINGER OVER MOSTLY THE EASTERN PORTIONS 
OF THE CWA AS COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO PUSH THROUGH THE CWA. COLD 
FRONT SHOULD BE THROUGH ENTIRE MIDSOUTH BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...BRINGING DRY AND COOLER WEATHER BACK TO THE MIDSOUTH.

ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL APPROACH THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH FRIDAY TIME FRAME. THIS WILL BRING RAIN CHANCES BACK TO THE 
MIDSOUTH. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL AGAIN BUILD INTO THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

IT IS ANOTHER CLEAR AND COLD NIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. HIGH
PRESSURE COVERING THE MIDSOUTH WILL MOVE EASTWARD TODAY WITH SURFACE
WINDS TURNING TO THE SOUTH. MEANWHILE...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL
OCCUR ACROSS THE AREA. THIS INDICATES ANOTHER SUNNY DAY WITH
HIGH TEMPERATURES A LITTLE WARMER THAN YESTERDAY.

THE WEATHER WILL BEGIN TO CHANGE TONIGHT TOWARD A PERIOD OF RAINY AND
POSSIBLY STORMY WEATHER FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. 00Z MODELS WERE A
LITTLE SLOWER IN BRINGING THE RAIN INTO THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT...AND
DO NOT SEE ANY REASON TO DISAGREE WITH THIS. LOWER LEVELS WILL BE
QUITE DRY SO WILL TAKE A WHILE BEFORE ANY RAIN REACHES THE GROUND.
UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL TURN TO THE SOUTHWEST ALLOWING FOR INCREASING
MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TONIGHT. SOME PATCHY RAIN MAY MOVE INTO
PART OF NORTH MS BY LATE TONIGHT.

A WARM FRONT WILL LIFT NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF COAST SUNDAY PUSHING
THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY / SUNDAY NIGHT. WIDESPREAD RAIN WILL
DEVELOP ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY WITH GOOD WARM AIR ADVECTION
ALOFT AND GOOD MOISTURE INFLUX. ISOLATED ELEVATED THUNDERSTORMS
ALSO POSSIBLE...MAINLY ACROSS NORTH MS...WITH STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT
DEVELOPING OVER THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH. THE MIDSOUTH WILL MOVE INTO THE
WARM SECTOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. MEANWHILE...THE MESOETA
INDICATES A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT...
WITH THE GFS SOMEWHAT FASTER IN TIMING OF THE FRONT. STRONG WIND
FIELD AND SHEAR DEVELOPS AHEAD OF THE FRONT MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS CLIMBING INTO 60S. CAPE VALUES ARE ON
THE LOW SIDE...500 TO 800 J/KG...BUT SHOULD STILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR
THE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE HIGH
SHEAR. WITH MENTION THE CHANCE OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS IN THE
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK FOR MONDAY AND NIGHT. WILL ALSO
NEED TO MONITOR THE HEAVY RAINFALL POTENTIAL AS THE GROUND IS
RATHER WET ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH AND A FEW RIVERS ARE HIGH.

WILL INCREASE THE POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT FROM WHAT WE NOW HAVE...
BASED ON A SLOWER FRONTAL MOVEMENT. IN FACT...POPS MAY NEED TO
BE CARRIED INTO TUESDAY MORNING FOR EASTER AREAS...BUT WILL LET
LATER SHIFTS TAKE A LOOK AT THIS.

THE LATEST GFS INDICATES RAIN MAY BE SPREADING BACK INTO THE AREA

WET WEATHER WILL BE IN STORE FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEKEND. AN
UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE WEST COAST OF CALIFORNIA

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MEMPHIS TN
340 AM CST FRI DEC 3 2004

.DISCUSSION...
RATHER UNEVENTFUL WEATHER WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TODAY
INTO SATURDAY. SKIES WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR. A WEAK SURFACE
TROUGH EXTENDS FROM WEST TN INTO NORTHWEST MS EARLY THIS MORNING.
WINDS TURN TO THE NORTHWEST BEHIND THE TROUGH BUT REMAIN LIGHT...
OTHERWISE THERE IS LITTLE EFFECT ON OUR WEATHER FROM THE TROUGH.
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST
TODAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOUT LIKE YESTERDAY. CLEAR SKIES
AND LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW FOR ANOTHER COLD NIGHT TONIGHT. WINDS
WILL TURN TO THE SOUTHWEST SATURDAY AND HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT
WILL SPREAD OVER THE AREA. THIS WILL BOOST TEMPERATURES SOME BY
SATURDAY AFTERNOON UNDER SUNNY SKIES.

A TURN TO RAINY AND POSSIBLY STORMY WEATHER IS FORECAST FOR
SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. A WARM FRONT WILL LIFT NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF
COAST SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL CAUSE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS ACROSS
THE MIDSOUTH WITH SCATTERED RAIN SPREADING INTO THE AREA AFTER
MIDNIGHT...MAINLY INTO PARTS OF NORTH MS. THE WARM FRONT WILL
PUSH INTO THE MIDSOUTH SUNDAY. WARM AIR ADVECTION ALOFT AND
MOISTURE ADVECTION ARE VERY IMPRESSIVE BY THE MODELS ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH. THINK RAIN WILL BE WIDESPREAD SUNDAY. IN ADDITION...THE
ATMOSPHERE WILL MAY BECOME UNSTABLE ENOUGH FOR ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH MS.

SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...THE MIDSOUTH MOVES INTO THE WARM SECTOR.
THE MESOETA INDICATES A COLD FRONT MOVING INTO WESTERN AR BY 12Z
MONDAY. THINK SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LIKELY ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH. THE MESOETA SHOWS BY 12Z MONDAY CAPES INCREASING TO AROUND
1000 J/KG ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE MIDSOUTH WITH HELICITY
VALUES 250 M2/S2 TO 300 M2/S2. THIS WOULD SUPPORT THE POSSIBILITY OF
SEVERE WEATHER. HOWEVER...THE GFS KEEPS THE UNSTABLE AIR MORE TO THE
SOUTH. ATTM...WILL MENTION THE CHANCE OF STRONG THUNDERSTORMS IN
THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.

THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH BY LATE MONDAY...
ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE IN TIMING THAT FAR IS NOT THAT GOOD WITH SOME
MODEL DIFFERENCES. WILL CONTINUE OUR FORECAST OF DRY WEATHER FOR
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY FOLLOWING THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.

.DISCUSSION...

HIGH PRESSURE TO REMAIN IN CONTROL OVER THE MIDSOUTHS WEATHER 
THROUGH SATURDAY. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IN THE SHORT TERM IS HOW LOW 
OVERNIGHTS TEMPS WILL GO TONIGHT. LATEST SFC ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT 
DEWPOINTS ARE RUNNING AROUND 5 TO 6 DEGREES HIGHER THAN THEY WERE 
THIS TIME YESTERDAY. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL PASS TO THE NORTH OF 
THE AREA THIS EVENING WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BACK IN BEHIND IT. 
BELIEVE IT WILL BE ANOTHER GOOD NIGHT FOR RADIATIONAL COOLING. WITH 
CLEAR SKIES...WINDS SHOULD DECOUPLE. EXPECT LOWS TO BE WARMER THAN 
LAST NIGHT...MAINLY DUE TO HIGHER DEWPOINTS. NORTHERN SECTIONS WILL 
DIP DOWN BELOW FREEZING AGAIN...WITH SOUTHERN SECTIONS STAYING JUST 
ABOVE OR REACHING THE FREEZING MARK. 

TRANQUIL CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST THROUGH SATURDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE 
50S AND LOWS IN THE 30S...TYPICAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. SUNSHINE 
SHOULD BE ABUNDANT...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SATURDAY AFTERNOON WHEN 
SOME HIGH CIRRUS WILL START TO MOVE IN.

WEATHER TURNS ACTIVE BY LATE SAT NIGHT INTO SUN. ANOTHER TROUGH WILL 
DIG INTO THE SW UNITED STATES...TURNING THE UPPER FLOW TO THE SW 
OVER THE AREA. SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS FLOW...INTERACTING 
WITH A WARM FRONT SOUTH OF THE AREA. THIS WILL SET UP A ROUND OF 
RAIN DUE TO OVERRUNNING. ETA/GFS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON BRINGING ONE 
ROUND OF RAIN THROUGH AFTER 06Z SUN AND THEREFORE HAD TO RAISE POPS 
FOR THIS TIME FRAME. RAISED POPS TO LIKELY ALL AREAS SUNDAY AS THE 
SW SHORTWAVE EJECTS OUT AND PUSHES A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE REGION. 
FRONT SHOULD CLEAR THE AREA DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS GOING SUNDAY NIGHT IN MONDAY...ENDING THEM MONDAY NIGHT 
AS THE FRONT GOES THROUGH. ECMWF SHOWING THIS QUICKER SOLUTION AS 
WELL...THEREFORE HAVE FAIRLY HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THIS FORECAST. HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN BEHIND THE FRONT WITH MORE COOL AIR FILTERING 
INTO THE MIDSOUTH.

THERE ARE SOME UNCERTAINTIES REGARDING THE LATTER HALF OF THE 
EXTENDED...PRIMARILY ON DAY 7 (THURSDAY). 00Z GFS SHOWED ANOTHER 
TROUGH PUSHING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION AT THIS TIME...WHILE 
THE 00Z ECMWF AND CANADIAN SOLUTIONS AMPLIFIED THE TROUGH OVER THE 
SOUTHWEST U.S. THE 12Z GFS HAS NOW COME AROUND AND IS IN FAIRLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE OTHER MODELS. PREFER THE SOLUTION OF THE TROUGH 
AMPLIFYING OVER THE SW SINCE THAT HAS BEEN THE TREND THIS FALL. ONLY 
SHOW SLIGHT POPS EARLY THURSDAY...WITH RAIN CHANCES ARE LOOKING SLIM 
AT THIS POINT. OF COURSE THIS IS DAY 7...SO WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR 
SOME MORE MODEL RUNS.

HIGH PRESSURE HAS SETTLED OVER THE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR 
WINDS TO GO CALM TONIGHT. THIS FACT...COMBINED WITH CLEAR SKIES AND 
A DRY ATMOSPHERE...WILL PROVIDE OPTIMAL RADIATIONAL COOLING 
CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO REACH AT OR BELOW 
FREEZING ALL AREAS TONIGHT...WITH NORTHERN SECTIONS REACHING THE 
MIDDLE TO UPPER 20S. WE HAVE REEVALUATED THE FREEZE WARNING 
SITUATION FOR THE AREA. AFTER ANALYSIS OF MORNING LOWS OVER THE PAST 
WEEK...ONLY RANDOLPH AND LAWRENCE COUNTIES IN ARKANSAS...HARDIN 
COUNTY TENNESSEE...AND TISHOMINGO COUNTY MISSISSIPPI...HAVE REACHED 
CRITICAL TEMPERATURE THRESHOLDS THAT WOULD SIGNAL AN END TO THE 
GROWING SEASON (28 DEGREES OR LOWER.) BASED ON THIS FACT...WILL 
ISSUE A FREEZE WARNING FOR MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH...EXCEPT THOSE 
COUNTIES JUST MENTIONED. FEEL THIS WILL ALSO HELP THOSE WITH HOME 
GARDENS...POTTED PLANTS...AND PETS TO BECOME BETTER PROTECTED.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE COOL AND DRY CONDITIONS 
THROUGH SATURDAY. BOTH THE GFS AND ETA SHOW UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVES 
PUSHING THROUGH A COLD FRONT...ONE ON THURSDAY AND ONE ON 
SATURDAY...BUT WITH LITTLE MOISTURE OVER THE AREA THERE WILL BE NO 
THREAT OF RAIN. 

THE WEATHER WILL BEGIN TO TURN ACTIVE ON SUNDAY. UPPER FLOW WILL 
TURN SOUTHWESTERLY AS A TROUGH DIGS INTO THE FOUR CORNERS AND 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SLIPS EAST OF THE AREA...ALLOWING INCREASING 
AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE TO SPREAD INTO THE REGION. MODELS SHOW A SERIES 
OF SHORTWAVES QUICKLY MOVING THROUGH THE SW FLOW AND INTERACTING 
WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE AREA. THIS WILL LIKELY SET THE 
STAGE FOR AN OVERRUNNING RAIN EVENT. LONG RANGE GUIDANCE IN FAIRLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT IN BRINGING THE MAIN TROUGH THROUGH THE AREA LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. ALL IN 
ALL...A WET TIME FOR SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY. HAVE BUMPED UP POPS A BIT 
FOR THIS TIME FRAME...AND WILL LIKELY NEED RAISED FURTHER AS WE GET 
CLOSER TO THE EVENT. AS ALWAYS...ITS TOUGH TO TIME SHORTWAVES MOVING 
THROUGH THE SW FLOW THIS FAR OUT...THEREFORE A BROADER RANGE OF 
CHANCE POPS WORKS BEST AT THIS POINT. COLDER AIR WILL FILTER IN BY 
WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE FRONT.

GROWING SEASON (28 DEGREES OR LOWER.) BASED ON THIS FACT...WILL 
ISSUE A FREEZE WARNING FOR MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH...EXCEPT THOSE 
COUNTIES JUST MENTIONED. FEEL THIS WILL ALSO HELP THOSE WITH HOME 
GARDENS...POTTED PLANTS...AND PETS TO BECOME BETTER PROTECTED.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE COOL AND DRY CONDITIONS 
THROUGH SATURDAY. BOTH THE GFS AND ETA SHOW UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVES 
PUSHING THROUGH A COLD FRONT...ONE ON THURSDAY AND ONE ON 
SATURDAY...BUT WITH LITTLE MOISTURE OVER THE AREA THERE WILL BE NO 
THREAT OF RAIN. 

THE WEATHER WILL BEGIN TO TURN ACTIVE ON SUNDAY. UPPER FLOW WILL 
TURN SOUTHWESTERLY AS A TROUGH DIGS INTO THE FOUR CORNERS AND 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SLIPS EAST OF THE AREA...ALLOWING INCREASING 
AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE TO SPREAD INTO THE REGION. MODELS SHOW A SERIES 
OF SHORTWAVES QUICKLY MOVING THROUGH THE SW FLOW AND INTERACTING 
WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE AREA. THIS WILL LIKELY SET THE 
STAGE FOR AN OVERRUNNING RAIN EVENT. LONG RANGE GUIDANCE IN FAIRLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT IN BRINGING THE MAIN TROUGH THROUGH THE AREA LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. ALL IN 
ALL...A WET TIME FOR SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY. HAVE BUMPED UP POPS A BIT 
FOR THIS TIME FRAME...AND WILL LIKELY NEED RAISED FURTHER AS WE GET 
CLOSER TO THE EVENT. AS ALWAYS...ITS TOUGH TO TIME SHORTWAVES MOVING 
THROUGH THE SW FLOW THIS FAR OUT...THEREFORE A BROADER RANGE OF 
CHANCE POPS WORKS BEST AT THIS POINT. COLDER AIR WILL FILTER IN BY 
WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE FRONT.

RAIN WILL COME TO AN END ACROSS MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH BY 06Z TONIGHT 
AS THE MAIN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE PUSHES THROUGH WITH DRIER AIR 
QUICKLY FILTERING IN AT ALL LEVELS. EVENING POPS WILL BE DETERMINED 
BY RADAR TRENDS CLOSE TO ISSUANCE TIME. CURRENTLY THINKING OF 
KEEPING CHANCE POPS ACROSS MOST AREAS FOR THE EVENING...TAKING POPS 
OUT MOST LOCATIONS AFTER MIDNIGHT EXCEPT FOR THE EXTREME EASTERN 
ZONES. THIS IS TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY LINGERING MOISTURE. DUE TO RAIN 
ENDING...WILL CANCEL THE FLOOD WATCH.

STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BE PRESENT TONIGHT WITH 30 TO 40 KT 
850MB WINDS AND -2 TO -6 850MB TEMPS. THIS WILL ALLOW LOWS TO DROP 
DOWN INTO THE 30S IN MOST AREAS DESPITE THE CLOUD COVER. EVEN SOME 
UPPER 20S WILL BE LIKELY ACROSS NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. THESE AREAS HAVE 
ALREADY EXPERIENCED FREEZING TEMPS...SO NO FREEZE WARNINGS ARE 
REQUIRED.

TRANQUIL CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY AS 
HIGH PRESSURE BECOMES THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE. TWO SHORTWAVES 
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA...ONE ON THURSDAY AND ONE ON 
SATURDAY...PUSHING COLD FRONTS THROUGH THE REGION. THE ATMOSPHERE 
WILL BE VERY DRY SO NO PRECIP IS EXPECTED. THESE FRONTS WILL ONLY 
HELP TO REINFORCE THE DRY AND COOL AIRMASS THAT WILL ALREADY BE IN 
PLACE. TEMPS THROUGH THIS STRETCH WILL BE SLIGHTLY BELOW TO NEAR 
NORMAL.

ANOTHER ACTIVE PERIOD OF WEATHER LOOKS LIKELY IN THE SUNDAY TO 
TUESDAY TIME FRAME. HIGH PRESSURE MOVES EAST OF THE AREA WHILE 
SOUTHWESTERLY UPPER LEVEL FLOW SETS UP. THIS WILL HELP TO PUSH A 
WARM FRONT NEAR THE REGION LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WITH A POSSIBLE 
OVERRUNNING EVENT SETTING UP. MAIN LOW AND TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH 
TUESDAY...WITH COLDER AIR TO FOLLOW FOR WEDNESDAY. GFS/ECMWF IN 
FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT ON THIS SETUP...BUT UNTIL TIMING ISSUES CAN BE 
BETTER RESOLVED...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR LATE SUNDAY INTO 
TUESDAY. IF CURRENT MODEL TRENDS HOLD...THESE NUMBERS WILL HAVE TO 
BE RAISED.

POSITIONED UNDERNEATH THE RIGHT ENTRANCE QUADRANT OF A 130 KT UPPER

WAY INTO OUR AREA...CONTINUING TO BRING IN ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE. THESE JET FEATURES WILL ALSO COMBINE WITH THE SURFACE
TROUGH TO ENHANCE LIFT OF THIS SATURATED AIRMASS. ALL OF THIS
POINTS TO THE LIKELIHOOD OF PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN AND
ISOLATED ELEVATED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT AND
TUESDAY. WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE GONE AHEAD AND ISSUED A FLOOD WATCH
FOR THE MID SOUTH FROM 6 PM TONIGHT THROUGH 6 PM TUESDAY. EXPECT
RAIN TOTALS TO AVERAGE BETWEEN 1 1/2 AND 2 WITH LOCALLY HIGHER
AMOUNTS. THESE AMOUNTS WILL POSE A FLOOD THREAT ACROSS THE AREA
WITH SOME AREA RIVERS ALREADY RUNNING HIGH.

BY TUESDAY NIGHT...THE 500 MB TROUGH WILL SWING EAST ACROSS THE AREA
BRINGING AN END TO THE RAIN FROM WEST TO EAST OVERNIGHT. HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE REGION FOR WEDNESDAY...WITH DRY
WEATHER AND HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S. OVERNIGHT LOWS THROUGH THE
END OF THE WEEK WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER TO MID 30S. THIS SHOULD
BRING AN END TO THE GROWING SEASON ACROSS THE MID SOUTH FOR 2004.

THE NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL RETURN FOR SUNDAY...AS THE FLOW ALOFT
TURNS SOUTHWESTERLY AGAIN AND MOISTURE BEGINS TO OVERRUN THE AREA...
AND A SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE MOVES THROUGH. THESE RAIN CHANCES WILL
CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...THEN TAPER OFF ON MONDAY AS A
SHORTWAVE RIDGE QUICKLY BUILDS OVER THE AREA. TEMPERATURES FOR THE
EXTENDED PERIOD SHOULD REMAIN SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.

THIS MORNINGS SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH
STRETCHED FROM NORTHEAST TEXAS INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS. RAIN HAS
BROKEN OUT ACROSS AREAS FROM SEARCY TO HOT SPRINGS IN ARKANSAS AND
POINTS TO THE NORTHWEST. THE NEW 12Z ETA RUN AND THE RUC HAVE SLOWED
THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS TROUGH. THIS SEEMS REASONABLE
CONSIDERING THE SLOW EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE ASSOCIATED RAIN
SHIELD. ALSO...RELATIVELY DRY LOW LEVELS OVER OUR AREA WILL DELAY THE
ONSET OF THE RAIN...ESPECIALLY ACROSS AREAS EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER. HAVE LOWERED POPS THIS AFTERNOON FOR MOST AREAS EAST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. IN ADDITION...HAVE TWEAKED THE CLOUD GRIDS TO
REFLECT MORE BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ACROSS SOUTHEAST SECTIONS OF
THE FORECAST AREA. WITH MORE BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS OVER THESE
LOCATIONS...TEMPERATURES SHOULD GET A FEW DEGREES WARMER.

1005 PM CST SAT NOV 27 2004

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD FRONT ACROSS 
CENTRAL TENNESSEE AND NORTHWEST ALABAMA. INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY 
SHOWS MUCH OF THE LOW STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS PROGRESSING OFF TO THE 
EAST WITH VERY LITTLE IF ANY CLOUD COVER LEFT ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR OVERNIGHT WILL BE LOW TEMPERATURES. 

SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE MID 
SOUTH OVERNIGHT...THOUGH A FEW HIGH CLOUDS WILL MOVE ACROSS NORTHERN 
SECTIONS TOWARD MORNING. WINDS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO DECOUPLE AND 
LOWS WILL FALL INTO THE 30S AS CURRENT DEWPOINTS AROUND 30 GRADUALLY 
MOVE SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT INTO NORTHWEST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. I HAVE MADE SKY GRID ADJUSTMENTS BASED UPON CURRENT TRENDS AND 
ISSUED A FREEZE WARNING FOR AREAS ALONG AND NORTH OF A LINE FROM 
WALNUT RIDGE ARKANSAS TO DYERSBURG AND UNION CITY TENNESSEE AS 
TEMPERATURES WILL DIP SLIGHTLY BELOW THE FREEZING POINT. UPDATED 
GRIDS WILL BE OUT MOMENTARILY.

A COLD FRONT ENTERING WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD 
BE NEAR THE TN RIVER BY 00Z. THIS WILL CARRY ANY REMAINING RAIN AWAY 
WITH IT. GOOD DRYING WORKING IN FROM THE NORTHWEST SHOULD RESULT IN 
CLEARING SKIES ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH THE MESOETA 
SUGGESTS THAT CLOUDS MAY HANG TOUGH AROUND THE PARIS TN AREA. HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL WORK INTO THE REGION LATE TONIGHT AND WITH CLEAR SKIES 
EXPECTED ACROSS MOST AREAS LATE TONIGHT TEMPERATURES SHOULD FALL 
INTO THE LOW TO MID 30S BY MORNING. ALTHOUGH FREEZING TEMPS CAN NOT 
BE RULED OUT...ESPECIALLY IN THE NOTORIOUS COLD SPOTS...NOT 
CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO WITH A FREEZE WARNING IN THOSE AREAS THAT 
HAVE NOT HAD A HARD FREEZE ALREADY. HOWEVER...AREAWIDE TEMPS AT 
LEAST IN THE MID 30S WITH LIGHT WINDS SHOULD ALLOW FOR SCATTERED 
AREAS OF FROST BY MORNING.

HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATES THE WEATHER TOMORROW AND GUIDANCE LOOKS 
ACCEPTABLE. TOMORROW NIGHT...THE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE OFF TO THE 
EAST AND THE STEERING FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY IN RESPONSE TO A 
CLOSED LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES. FRAGMENTS OFF OF THIS LOW WILL 
BEGIN TO MOVE OVER THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...BOTH GFS AND ETA 
SHOW THAT THE LOW LEVELS ARE EXTREMELY DRY. SO EXPECT THAT IT WILL 
TAKE SOME TIME FOR RAIN TO ACTUALLY REACH THE GROUND...PROBABLY NOT 
UNTIL MONDAY PERHAPS LATE SUNDAY NIGHT OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS. 

ON MONDAY...THE 850MB WARM FRONT AND A SURFACE INVERTED TROF WILL 
SET UP OVER THE AREA. TOGETHER WITH AN UPPER SHORTWAVE AND GOOD 
UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION...HAVE HIGH CONFIDENCE THAT RAIN WILL WORK 
INTO THE REGION FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. 
INSTABILITY BOTH SURFACE BASED AND ELEVATED LOOKS WEAK AND FEEL THAT 
THERE WILL NOT BE ANY THUNDER AROUND. 

GFS/ETA CARRY SIMILAR SOLUTIONS PAST MONDAY ALTHOUGH THE ETA HAS A 
FASTER SOLUTION. THE ETA BRING UP A SURFACE LOW MONDAY NIGHT AND 
EXITS THE REGION TUESDAY MORNING WITH RAIN COMING TO AN END AS EARLY 
AS TUESDAY NIGHT. THE GFS BRINGS THE LOW UP ON TUESDAY AND DOES NOT 
CLEAR THE DEEPER MOISTURE OUT UNTIL WEDNESDAY. GUT FEELING BASED 
UPON THE PATTERN IS THAT THE ETA MAY BE TOO FAST AND THAT ACTUALITY 
MAY BE CLOSER TO THE GFS. ALSO THE INSTABILITY DOES NOT LOOK TOO 
IMPRESSIVE SINCE THE ENTIRE DEPTH OF THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE 
SATURATED THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...CAN NOT RULE OUT A 
FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER WITH THE BEST CHANCES FURTHER SOUTH INTO THE 
WARM SECTOR. AM ALSO LESS KEEN ON FLOODING POTENTIAL SINCE THE RAIN 
SHOULD FALL OVER A PROLONGED DURATION. SOME MINOR RIVER GENERAL 
FLOODING MAY BE POSSIBLE BUT NOT EXPECTING ANY SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS 
FROM THIS SYSTEM.

THE NEXT SYSTEM IS IN THE DAY 6 OR 7 TIME FRAME WHEN AN UPPER TROUGH 
WILL APPROACH THE REGION WITH MOISTURE SURGING UP OUT OF THE 
SOUTHWEST.

A COLD FRONT ENTERING WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD 
BE NEAR THE TN RIVER BY 00Z. THIS WILL CARRY ANY REMAINING RAIN AWAY 
WITH IT. GOOD DRYING WORKING IN FROM THE NORTHWEST SHOULD RESULT IN 
CLEARING SKIES ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH THE MESOETA 
SUGGESTS THAT CLOUDS MAY HANG TOUGH AROUND THE PARIS TN AREA. HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL WORK INTO THE REGION LATE TONIGHT AND WITH CLEAR SKIES 
EXPECTED ACROSS MOST AREAS LATE TONIGHT TEMPERATURES SHOULD FALL 
INTO THE LOW TO MID 30S BY MORNING. ALTHOUGH FREEZING TEMPS CAN NOT 
BE RULED OUT...ESPECIALLY IN THE NOTORIOUS COLD SPOTS...NOT 
CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO WITH A FREEZE WARNING IN THOSE AREAS THAT 
HAVE NOT HAD A HARD FREEZE ALREADY. HOWEVER...AREAWIDE TEMPS AT 
LEAST IN THE MID 30S WITH LIGHT WINDS SHOULD ALLOW FOR SCATTERED 
AREAS OF FROST BY MORNING.

HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATES THE WEATHER TOMORROW AND GUIDANCE LOOKS 
ACCEPTABLE. TOMORROW NIGHT...THE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE OFF TO THE 
EAST AND THE STEERING FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY IN RESPONSE TO A 
CLOSED LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES. FRAGMENTS OFF OF THIS LOW WILL 
BEGIN TO MOVE OVER THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...BOTH GFS AND ETA 
SHOW THAT THE LOW LEVELS ARE EXTREMELY DRY. SO EXPECT THAT IT WILL 
TAKE SOME TIME FOR RAIN TO ACTUALLY REACH THE GROUND...PROBABLY NOT 
UNTIL MONDAY PERHAPS LATE SUNDAY NIGHT OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS. 

ON MONDAY...THE 850MB WARM FRONT AND A SURFACE INVERTED TROF WILL 
SET UP OVER THE AREA. TOGETHER WITH AN UPPER SHORTWAVE AND GOOD 
UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION...HAVE HIGH CONFIDENCE THAT RAIN WILL WORK 
INTO THE REGION FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. 
INSTABILITY BOTH SURFACE BASED AND ELEVATED LOOKS WEAK AND FEEL THAT 
THERE WILL NOT BE ANY THUNDER AROUND. 

GFS/ETA CARRY SIMILAR SOLUTIONS PAST MONDAY ALTHOUGH THE ETA HAS A 
FASTER SOLUTION. THE ETA BRING UP A SURFACE LOW MONDAY NIGHT AND 
EXITS THE REGION TUESDAY MORNING WITH RAIN COMING TO AN END AS EARLY 
AS TUESDAY NIGHT. THE GFS BRINGS THE LOW UP ON TUESDAY AND DOES NOT 
CLEAR THE DEEPER MOISTURE OUT UNTIL WEDNESDAY. GUT FEELING BASED 
UPON THE PATTERN IS THAT THE ETA MAY BE TOO FAST AND THAT ACTUALITY

OVER THE AREA. THIS UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL SWING EAST AS THE 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MIDDLE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION BY SUNDAY. 
AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO

TO OUR SOUTH ALONG THE GULF COAST STATES. THIS SHOULD KEEP 
THUNDERSTORMS FROM REACHING SEVERE LIMITS TONIGHT. LOW TEMPERATURES

ON SATURDAY...THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT
NORTHEAST AND WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING THE

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO QUICKLY ORGANIZE OVER THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES THIS AFTERNOON AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH DIGS
OVER THE AREA. THIS UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL SWING EAST AS THE
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MIDDLE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION BY SUNDAY.
AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO
STRENGTHEN...WITH A 50-60 KT LOW LEVEL JET OVER-SPREADING THE MID
SOUTH BY LATER THIS EVENING. THIS WILL HELP TO RAPIDLY DRAW LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE NORTHWARD...WITH DEWPOINTS SURGING FROM THE 30S INTO
THE 50S BY LATER TONIGHT. RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BREAK OUT
LATE TONIGHT...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT AHEAD OF THIS LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM. LOOKING AT THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS...APPEARS THAT A STABLE
LAYER ROUGHLY BELOW 850 MB WILL PREVENT ANY CONVECTION THAT
DEVELOPS TONIGHT FROM BEING SURFACE BASED...WITH ANY THUNDERSTORMS
REMAINING ELEVATED. ATMOSPHERIC WINDS WILL BE RATHER STRONG WITH
SIGNIFICANT WIND SHEAR (BOTH SPEED & DIRECTIONAL) PRESENT. EVEN
THOUGH SHEAR PROFILES WOULD SUPPORT SUPERCELL DEVELOPMENT...LOW LEVEL
INSTABILITY WILL BE LACKING...WITH THE BEST SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY
REMAINING TO OUR SOUTH ALONG THE GULF COAST STATES. THIS SHOULD
KEEP THUNDERSTORMS FROM REACHING SEVERE LIMITS TONIGHT. LOW
TEMPERATURES WILL BE HELD UP TONIGHT AS WINDS CONTINUE FROM THE
SOUTH.

ON SATURDAY...THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT
NORTHEAST AND WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING THE

AN AXIS OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM THE TN RIVER THROUGH NORTH MS 
AND THROUGH CENTRAL LOUISIANA. SATELLITE SHOWS MAINLY CLEAR SKIES 
OVER THE REGION AND ONLY A FEW CIRRUS ARE EXPECTED TO DRIFT THROUGH 
TONIGHT.

THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE REGION TO BE JUST 
EAST OF THE AREA BY MORNING. WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO PICK UP ON THE 
BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH TONIGHT WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE BOUNDARY LAYER 
STIRRED UP. SO PROXIMITY TO THE HIGH IS IMPORTANT TONIGHT IN TERMS 
OF FREEZING TEMPS SINCE DEW POINTS ARE BELOW FREEZING. AM FAIRLY 
CONFIDENT THAT THE INITIAL FREEZE WARNING AREA FOR NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI WILL SEE MORNING TEMPS AT OR BELOW THE FREEZING POINT. 
AM SOMEWHAT LESS CONFIDENT THAT TEMPS WILL MAKE IT TO FREEZING IN 
THE WATCH AREA. HOWEVER DO EXPECT THAT TEMPS IN THIS AREA WILL BE 
CLOSE TO FREEZING SO WILL UPGRADE THE WATCH TO A WARNING. 

SHOULD SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER DURING THE AFTERNOON ON FRIDAY 
AS THE NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES THE REGION. EXPECT WARMER TEMPS WITH 
ENOUGH SUNSHINE IN THE MORNING AND WARM AIR ADVECTION AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM. AFTER MIDNIGHT EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSHOWERS TO BREAK 
OUT OVER CENTRAL PORTIONS OF ARKANSAS IN RESPONSE TO THE EXIT REGION 
OF THE UPPER JET MOVING OVER AN AREA WITH GOOD LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
RETURN. MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE SUFFICIENT TO SUPPORT THUNDER. 
THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE WELL AHEAD OF THE SURFACE COLD FRONT WHICH 
WILL STILL BE BACK IN OKLAHOMA AT THIS TIME. THERE IS EXTREMELY GOOD 
LOW LEVEL HELICITY IN PLACE OVER THE REGION...HOWEVER SINCE THE 
CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE ELEVATED INSTEAD OF SURFACE BASED NOT 
EXPECTING A TORNADO THREAT. THE RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD THE 
AREA...PERHAPS MAKING IT AS FAR EAST AS TUPELO BY MORNING. ANOTHER 
SHOT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS POSSIBLE WITH THE COLD FRONT AS 
IT MOVES THROUGH EASTERN ARKANSAS DURING THE LATE MORNING...REST OF 
THE AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON. 

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE REGION FOR MOST OF THE WEEKEND. BY 
SUNDAY NIGHT...THE UPPER STEERING FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY IN 
RESPONSE TO ANOTHER CLOSED LOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN US. INITIALLY 
THERE WILL BE LOW CHANCES OF RAIN OVER THE REGION WITH CONVECTION 
DEVELOPING OVER EAST TEXAS ALONG THE STALLED OUT COLD FRONT NEAR THE 
GULF COAST. HOWEVER BY TUESDAY...THE SURFACE FRONT AND ESPECIALLY 
THE 850MB FRONT WILL SURGE NORTHWARD INTO THE AREA AS THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHES. LOOKS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN 
ON TUESDAY AS A STRONG SHORTWAVE EJECTS OUT FROM THE SYSTEM AND 
THROUGH THE AREA. SURFACE INSTABILITY IS MEAGER HOWEVER MID LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES DO SUPPORT THUNDER. ON WEDNESDAY THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL BLAST THROUGH THE AREA DELIVERING 
ANOTHER HEALTHY SHOT OF COLD AIR.

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM EAST TEXAS INTO THE MIDSOUTH 
THIS MORNING. AREAS OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WERE VERY CHILLY THIS 
MORNING WITH MANY LOCATIONS FALLING BELOW FREEZING. REPORTS FROM 
HARRISBURG THROUGH JONESBORO TO PIGGOTT AND POINTS WESTWARD 
SUGGESTED THAT MIN TEMPS FELL BELOW 30 DEGREES WHICH LIKELY BROUGHT 
AN END TO THE GROWING SEASON. A FREEZE WATCH AND FREEZE WARNINGS 
REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF WEST TN AND NORTH MS 
WHERE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY/PROBABILITY OF FREEZING TEMPERATURES 
THAT COULD IMPACT VEGETATION. THERE ARE NO UPDATES PLANNED AT THIS

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM EAST TEXAS INTO THE MIDSOUTH 
THIS MORNING. AREAS OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WERE VERY CHILLY THIS 
MORNING WITH MANY LOCATIONS FALLING BELOW FREEZING. REPORTS FROM 
HARRISBURG THROUGH JONESBORO TO PIGGOTT AND POINTS WESTWARD 
SUGGESTED THAT MIN TEMPS FELL BELOW 30 DEGREES WHICH LIKELY BROUGHT 
AN END TO THE GROWING SEASON. A FREEZE WATCH AND FREEZE WARNINGS 
REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF WEST TN AND NORTH MS 
WHERE THERE IS A POSSIBILITY/PROBABILITY OF FREEZING TEMPERATURES 
THAT COULD IMPACT VEGETATION. THERE ARE NO UPDATES PLANNED AT THIS 
TIME...SKIES ARE NOW MOSTLY SUNNY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH AND MAX TEMPS 
LOOK REASONABLE.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MIDSOUTH TODAY BRINGING MOSTLY 
SUNNY SKIES TO THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE COOL SIDE WITH 
HIGHS ONLY IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S.

TONIGHT...THE HIGH RACES EASTWARD ALLOWING THE WINDS TO PICK UP 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. THEREFORE DON/T EXPECT AS COLD A NIGHT AS PREVIOUS 
THOUGHT. HOWEVER...LOWS STILL MAY GET CLOSE TO FREEZING IN EASTERN 
SECTIONS OF CWA. WILL ISSUE A FREEZE WARNING FOR SAVANNAH TO TUPELO 
AREAS AND A FREEZE WATCH FOR THE AREA JUST NORTHWEST OF THE WARNING 
AREA.

CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE DURING THE DAY FRIDAY AS A COLD FRONT WILL 
BEGIN APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST. EXPECT SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO BEGIN TO MOVE INTO WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA 
FRIDAY EVENING. 

FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE CWA ON SATURDAY. THIS WILL KEEP CHANCES 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST. COOLER TEMPERATURES 
WILL MOVE BACK INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK INTO THE AREA FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT BRINGING DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES BACK TO THE CWA. 
HOWEVER...TEMPERATURES WILL STAY ON THE COOL SIDE.

ON MONDAY A WARM FRONT WILL BEGIN TO LIFT NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF 
COAST. THIS IS VERY SIMILAR TO THE SYSTEM WHICH OCCURRED LAST NIGHT. 
THE FRONT WILL HANG UP OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA THROUGH 
TUESDAY WHEN THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER AND TRAILING COLD FRONT PUSHES 
INTO THE AREA.  THIS WILL BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS BACK TO THE MIDSOUTH. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK

.SHORT-TERM PERIOD (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A STRENGTHENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER SOUTHERN INDIANA THIS
AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT TO THE NORTHEAST. A COLD FRONT
EXTENDS SOUTH FROM THIS LOW AND IS STRETCHED ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE
AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO FILTER
INTO THE AREA THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...AS
STRONG COLD ADVECTION CONTINUES THROUGH TONIGHT. A LARGE SHIELD
OF LOW CLOUDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL
LINGER BEHIND THE FRONT...WITH CLOUDS SLOWLY CLEARING AFTER MIDNIGHT
FROM WEST TO EAST. ALTHOUGH TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE 30S
TONIGHT ACROSS THE AREA...CLOUDS AND WIND WILL KEEP LOWS ABOVE THE
FREEZING MARK AREAWIDE TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE MID
SOUTH FOR THANKSGIVING DAY...BRINGING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES BUT
CONTINUED UNSEASONABLY COOL TEMPERATURES. CLEAR SKIES AND THE
COLDEST TEMPERATURES OF THE YEAR ARE EXPECTED ON THURSDAY NIGHT.
SOME AREAS MAY SEE FREEZING TEMPERATURES FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS
YEAR AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A FREEZE
WARNING FOR SOME AREAS. THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE TO A
POSITION SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA ON FRIDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A
RETURN TO SOUTHERLY FLOW...ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO BE 10 DEGREES
WARMER ON AVERAGE AS COMPARED TO THURSDAYS HIGH TEMPERATURES. THERE
WILL ALSO BE AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE LEVELS AND A RETURN TO PARTLY
CLOUDY SKIES.

.EXTENDED PERIOD (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM WILL ORGANIZE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES
ON FRIDAY. AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL DIG SOUTHEAST
ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES ON FRIDAY. A 110 KT. UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK
ROTATING THROUGH THE UPPER TROUGH WILL HELP TO DEVELOP A SURFACE LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WHICH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST
ACROSS THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON SATURDAY. AS THIS LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEAST IT WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE
AREA ON SATURDAY. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BREAK OUT
ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH FRIDAY NIGHT AND MOVE EAST
ON SATURDAY. AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS THAT THE BEST INSTABILITY WILL
REMAIN TO OUR SOUTH. WIND FIELDS SHOULD BE STRONG AGAIN WITH THIS
SYSTEM...SO WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN
TO ENSURE THAT INSTABILITY REMAINS LOW AS CURRENTLY FORECAST. AT THIS
TIME...APPEARS THAT ANY SEVERE WEATHER THREAT SHOULD REMAIN TO OUR
SOUTH...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH. THE COLD FRONT WILL CLEAR THE
AREA BY SATURDAY EVENING...ALLOWING FOR A RETURN OF DRY WEATHER AND
SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES FOR SUNDAY.

ANOTHER DISTURBANCE WILL APPROACH OUR AREA FROM THE SOUTHWEST
BY THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...AS THE FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY
ALOFT. EXPECT ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR RAIN BEGINNING MONDAY
AFTERNOON AND CONTINUING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER WILL
ONCE AGAIN RETURN FOR NEXT WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN NEAR
AVERAGE FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK.

BUSY NIGHT WITH THE VERY HEAVY RAINS OVER NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND 
THE SEVERE/TORNADIC THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SAME REGION EARLIER. WILL 
KEEP AN EYE ON THE WARM FRONT CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER THE SRN 
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. IT IS FORECAST TO LIFT NORTHWARD OVER 
THE NEXT FEW HOURS. THIS COUPLED WITH A STRONG 250MB JET WILL LIKELY 
BRING ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS TO THE MID SOUTH BY EARLY MORNING. 
CURRENTLY THE STRONGER STORMS ARE LOCATED OVER THE MS/LA STATE LINE 
JUST WEST OF JACKSON...WHILE FARTHER WEST A SQUALL LINE OF STRONG 
THUNDERSTORMS WAS APPROACHING THE WESTERN EDGES OF LA. THIS IS IN 
PROXIMITY TO THE 110KT JET STREAK EDGING OUR WAY.

A POTENT UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER WEST TEXAS THIS AFTERNOON WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
TONIGHT. A STRONG 130 KT UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK WILL CONTINUE TO
MOVE THROUGH THE BASE OF THE TROUGH AND EJECT NORTHEASTWARD TOWARDS
THE MID SOUTH LATER TONIGHT. AS THIS STRONG UPPER JET STREAK EJECTS
OUT OF THE BASE OF THE TROUGH...THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BECOME
NEGATIVELY TILTED...HELPING TO ENHANCE DIFFLUENCE ALOFT. THE REGION
WILL ALSO BECOME CO-LOCATED BENEATH THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF THIS JET
STREAK. THIS SHOULD ENHANCE LARGE SCALE ASCENT ACROSS THE AREA. THE
STRONG UPPER SYSTEM HAS ALSO INDUCED A SURFACE LOW OVER THE ARKLATEX
REGION THIS AFTERNOON. THIS SURFACE LOW WILL CONTINUE TO DEEPEN AS IT
MOVES NORTHEAST ACROSS ARKANSAS INTO SOUTHEAST MISSOURI LATER
TONIGHT. AS THIS LOW MOVES NORTHEAST IT WILL HELP TO DRAW A WARM
FRONT STRETCHED ACROSS NORTH-CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI THIS AFTERNOON
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. THIS FRONT MAY ACT TO FOCUS
CONVECTION LATER THIS EVENING ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH.
WIND FIELDS THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERE WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN
THIS EVENING AS WELL. THE NOSE OF A 65 KT. LOW LEVEL JET WILL ALSO
MOVE NORTH INTO THE AREA TONIGHT...HELPING TO SUPPORT CONVECTION.
SIGNIFICANT SHEAR WILL BE PRESENT TONIGHT TO ALLOW ANY
THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP TO BECOME SEVERE...WITH DAMAGING WINDS
AND ISOLATED TORNADOES THE MOST LIKELY MODE OF SEVERE CONVECTION.

ON WEDNESDAY...THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT
NORTHEAST AND WILL HELP TO DRAG A COLD FRONT SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE
AREA BY LATER IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. IN THE UPPER LEVELS...
THE STRONG JET STREAK FROM TUESDAY NIGHT WILL ROTATE THROUGH THE
AREA...HELPING TO DRY SLOT MOST OF THE REGION. THE AREA WILL REMAIN
ENTRENCHED IN THE WARM SECTOR THROUGH THE DAY...AND WITH
CONTINUED SIGNIFICANT WIND SHEAR IN PLACE...ANY STORMS THAT CAN FORM
ALONG THE FRONT WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE DAMAGING WINDS AND
LARGE HAIL. CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN MORE SCATTERED IN NATURE AS
COMPARED TO TONIGHT.

ONCE THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL SPILL INTO
THE REGION FROM THE NORTHWEST. SKIES WILL REMAIN CLOUDY WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...BUT WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR BY THURSDAY MORNING. THANKSGIVING
DAY WILL FEATURE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND TEMPERATURES STRUGGLING TO
GET OUT OF THE 40S. THE FIRST FREEZE WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE
REGION THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING.

THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH ON FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...
BRINGING THE NEXT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
AREA. DRY WEATHER WILL COME BACK FOR SUNDAY...WITH ANOTHER STORM
SYSTEM BRINGING RENEWED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS ON MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT.

CLOSER TO 2000 J/KG AND A STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET. SPC HAS PUT THE 
NORTHEASTERN PORTION OF CWA INTO THE SLIGHT RISK AREA IN THE LATEST

OF THE CWA. WILL LEAVE ONLY A CHANCE FOR RAIN IN THE SOUTHEASTERN 
ZONES.

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE 
CWA AND WILL BRING NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND DRY WEATHER.

FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...A REINFORCING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO 
THE MIDSOUTH AND BRING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RAIN TO THE AREA. SLIGHTLY 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA BEHIND THE FRONT.

.DISCUSSION...

LATEST RADAR IMAGES SHOWS LIGHT RAIN OVER MOST OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS 
MORNING. THIS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SHORTWAVE THAT IS MOVING THROUGH 
THE AREA. SHORTWAVE WILL EXIT THE AREA THIS MORNING AS ANOTHER ONE 
MOVES IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST. THIS SHORTWAVE WILL SKIRT SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS OF THE CWA. IN ADDITION...A WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTHWARD 
INTO THE MIDSOUTH. WILL GO WITH HIGHEST POPS ACROSS SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS OF THE CWA.

TONIGHT...THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH WILL MOVE INTO THE WARM SECTOR BEHIND 
THE WARM FRONT AS A SFC LOW MOVES NORTHEASTWARD INTO WESTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE CWA AFTER MIDNIGHT. SEVERE WEATHER IS LOOKING LESS 
LIKELY WITH THIS ROUND OF PRECIPITATION. INSTABILITY IS LACKING WITH 
CAPE VALUES ONLY AROUND 300 J/KG. HOWEVER THERE IS A 50 KNOT LOW 
LEVEL JET MOVING INTO THE CWA BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. CAN/T RULE OUT AN 
ISOLATED SEVERE STORM AND SPC HAS LEFT ONLY EXTREME SOUTHWESTERN 
COUNTIES IN SLIGHT RISK IN LATEST DAY ONE OUTLOOK.

WEDNESDAY...EXPECT TONIGHTS ROUND OF PRECIPITATION TO STILL BE 
OCCURRING THROUGH EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA THROUGH MID-MORNING. 
BY MID-DAY A DRY SLOT MOVES OVER THE MIDSOUTH BEFORE THE UPPER 
TROUGH AND SFC COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO NORTHWESTERN CWA LATE IN THE 
AFTERNOON. EXPECT SOME REDEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ALONG FRONT. EXPECT THESE THUNDERSTORMS TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF 
BECOMING SEVERE AS INSTABILITY WILL BE BETTER WITH CAPE VALUES 
CLOSER TO 2000 J/KG AND A STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET. SPC HAS PUT THE 
NORTHEASTERN PORTION OF CWA INTO THE SLIGHT RISK AREA IN THE LATEST 
DAY TWO OUTLOOK.

BY LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...COLD FRONT WILL HAVE PUSHED THROUGH MOST 
OF THE CWA. WILL LEAVE ONLY A CHANCE FOR RAIN IN THE SOUTHEASTERN 
ZONES.

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON...HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE 
CWA AND WILL BRING NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND DRY WEATHER.

FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...A REINFORCING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO 
THE MIDSOUTH AND BRING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RAIN TO THE AREA. SLIGHTLY 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA BEHIND THE FRONT.

FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST...HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES A WEAKLY DEFINED 
STATIONARY BOUNDARY ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS AND ANOTHER STATIONARY BOUNDARY ALONG THE GULF COAST. MAIN 
FORECAST CONCERN TONIGHT WILL BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES. LATEST 88D 
RADAR TRENDS ACROSS THE REGION SHOW RAIN SHOWERS SHOWING A 
DIMINISHING TREND AS MAIN AREA OF FORCING CONTINUES TO SLIDE 
NORTHEAST EARLY THIS EVENING. AT THE SAME TIME...DRY AIR TO THE 
NORTH WILL TRY TO BUILD IN AT MID LEVELS WHICH WILL DIMINISH ANY 
PRECIPITATION TO DRIZZLE...ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH ABUNDANT 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN PLACE AND CURRENT DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S...I 
DON/T EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO DROP MUCH TONIGHT.

MONDAY...STATIONARY FRONT ALIGNED ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL BEGIN TO 
MOVE SLOWLY NORTH AS A WARM FRONT DURING THE DAY. ANOTHER WEAK MID 
LEVEL IMPULSE FROM THE SOUTHWEST WILL GENERATE ANOTHER CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH...WITH BEST PROBABILITIES ACROSS 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. NOT EXPECTING ANY THUNDERSTORMS WITH WEAK MID 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND INSTABILITY. 

MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING....WARM FRONT WILL MOVE INTO 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI OVERNIGHT AND INTO TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS TUESDAY MORNING. 0-6 KM BULK SHEAR VALUES WILL INCREASE TO 
NEAR 40 KTS...0-3 KM SRH VALUES WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE TOWARDS 
MORNING TO UNDER 150 M2/S2. HOWEVER WITH CAPES LIMITED TO UNDER 800 
J/KG AND EQUILIBRIUM LEVELS BELOW 30 KFT...THINK THAT LOW TOPPED 
SUPERCELLS /MINI-SUPERCELLS/ WOULD BE THE BEST PROBABILITY FOR 
SEVERE WEATHER OTHER THAN HAIL.

TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND TUESDAY NIGHT...A 40 KT 850 MB LOW LEVEL JET 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
IN ADDITION...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WITH 
SURFACE COLD FRONT PASSING THROUGH THE MID SOUTH TUESDAY 
NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING. 850/500 MB WINDS /30KTS/50KTS/ NEARLY 
UNIDIRECTIONAL AND 700 MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS GREATER THAN 5C 
SUGGEST MAIN SEVERE WEATHER THREAT WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS AND HAIL. 
CURRENT HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK HANDLING SITUATION WELL. 

WEDNESDAY...WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LEVEL LOW 
WILL SWING THROUGH THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING 
THEN DAY ON WEDNESDAY. BOTH ETA AND GFS SHOW DRY SLOT TRYING TO 
BUILD IN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTION OF THE FORECAST AREA AND WILL 
KEEP OTHER AREAS DRY.
 
THANKSGIVING DAY THROUGH SUNDAY...LITTLE IF ANY CHANGES NEEDED FOR 
LONG RANGE FORECAST WITH MODELS TODAY IN CLOSER AGREEMENT THAN THE 
PAST FEW DAYS. LATEST 00Z RUN OF GFS NOT AS STRONG WITH THE COLD AIR 
AS THE PREVIOUS RUN AND LOOKING MORE LIKE YESTERDAY/S EUROPEAN 
SOLUTION. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING DRY WEATHER TO THE MID SOUTH FOR 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. A STRONG UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL DROP OUT OF 
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST AND AFFECT THE LOWER AND MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY SUNDAY AFTERNOON INTO MONDAY WILL ADD A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSES PLACES WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI INTO NORTHWEST ARKANSAS AND SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA. 
LATEST SATELLITE TRENDS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH SHOW A FEW BREAKS IN 
THE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE REGION. HOWEVER WITH THE 
APPROACH OF ANOTHER MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE...CLOUDS WILL QUICKLY FILL 
BACK IN. 

315K SURFACE INDICATES ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL INCREASE ACROSS 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI THIS AFTERNOON AS A MID LEVEL WAVE MOVES ACROSS 
PORTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON. REGIONAL 88D RADARS 
ALREADY SHOWING RAINFALL AFFECTING CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI

FORECAST CONCERNS TONIGHT WILL BE FOG POTENTIAL...CLOUD COVER AND 
TEMPERATURES. 

TONIGHT...WEAK MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MIDDLE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT AND ADJUSTED POPS FOR SLIGHT CHANCE OF A 
RAIN SHOWER ACROSS THE EXTREME NORTHERN COUNTIES OVERNIGHT. FOG 
POTENTIAL IS A CONCERN TONIGHT AS WINDS WILL DECOUPLE TONIGHT ALONG 
WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS HANGING IN THE 50S. PATCHY FOG CAN BE 
EXPECTED THIS EVENING AS BOUNDARY LAYER REMAINS SATURATED WITH MANY 
PLACES EXPERIENCING AREAS OF FOG AFTER MIDNIGHT. LOW TEMPERATURES 
TONIGHT WILL FALL TO AROUND CURRENT DEWPOINTS.

LONG TERM...COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA DURING 
THE DAY ON SATURDAY. TYPICAL MODEL PARAMETERS NOT PICKING UP ON FORCING AND 
IS REFLECTED IN LOW POPS WITHIN THE MOS GUIDANCE DURING THE DAYTIME. 
315K SURFACE SHOWS ISENTROPIC ASCENT INCREASING ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS AND SPREADING ACROSS THE REST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT. NOT THAT IMPRESSED WITH THUNDER 
CHANCES AS LI AND SHOWALTER INDICIES WILL REMAIN ABOVE ZERO AND 
LIMITED CAPE. /BELOW 100 J/KG/ ONGOING POPS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT LOOK 
GOOD AND DO NOT PLAN TO MAKE ANY CHANGES AT THIS TIME. AMPLE LOW

RETAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY/CLOUDY SKIES. CONSEQUENTLY...TEMPERATURES WILL 
NOT VARY THAT MUCH FROM THE PAST COUPLE FEW DAYS WITH HIGHS IN THE 
60S AND LOWS MAINLY IN THE 50S.

SUNDAY AND MONDAY...COLD FRONT WILL BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY ACROSS 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND WILL BEGIN TO MOVE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. 
GFS SHOWS ISENTROPIC ASCENT INCREASING DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING AS MID LEVEL SHEAR AXIS PASSES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. NOT 
THAT IMPRESSED WITH THUNDER CHANCES AT THIS TIME AND WILL LEAVE 
PRECIPITATION AS RAIN FOR NOW. HIGHS WILL RANGE FROM THE UPPER 50S 
TO LOWER 60S WITH LOWS IN THE 40S TO LOWER 50S. WARM FRONT WILL MOVE 
NORTH ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT WITH

EXIST BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS. LONG RANGE GFS BRINGS THE FRONT 
THROUGH THE MID SOUTH A BIT QUICKER THAN THE PREVIOUS RUN. EUROPEAN

.DISCUSSION...
PRESSURE PATTERN RATHER WEAK OVER MIDSOUTH THIS MORNING. SURFACE
LOW NEAR MKC. UPPER LOW AND ASSOCIATED VORT NEAR PAH LIFTING
NORTHEAST. RADAR STILL CARRYING ECHOES OVER ABOUT EASTERN THIRD
OF CWA WITH AREA MOVING VERY SLOWLY EAST. LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY
DRIZZLE ELSEWHERE. TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM 53 TO 58 ACROSS ENTIRE
AREA AT 09Z.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SUNDAY)...
ONCE UPPER SYSTEM CLEARS THE AREA THIS MORNING...NO REAL SOURCE OF
LIFT FOR ABOUT 24 HOURS. NO DRYING EITHER...HOWEVER. EXPECT LOW
CLOUDS TO BE THE STORY OF THE DAY...AND PROBABLY SOME PATCHY DRIZZLE.
WILL GO WITH LOW POPS THIS AFTERNOON IN CASE PRECIPITATION GETS A
LITTLE HEAVIER THAN DRIZZLE. HAVE LOWERED MAX TEMPS A CATEGORY TODAY
WITH CLOUDS STAYING IN...AND QUITE FRANKLY...EVEN THESE MAY BE A
LITTLE TOO HIGH.

WEAK VORT APPROACHES AREA LATE TONIGHT...AND WILL KEEP SMALL POPS
WITH EXPECTATION THAT ANY PRECIPITATION WILL PROBABLY BE TOWARD
SUNRISE ON SATURDAY. LOWS PRETTY SIMILAR TO THIS MORNING. NEXT IN
SERIES WILL BE DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS SATURDAY NIGHT WITH BEST
POPS ACROSS ABOUT SOUTHEAST HALF OF CWA. WILL GO LIKELY FOR SATURDAY
NIGHT THERE...CHANCE ELSEWHERE...AND CHANCE EVERYWHERE ON SUNDAY.
MADE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS TO SATURDAY AND SUNDAY TEMPS...LOWERED HIGHS
A LITTLE.
&&

.LONG TERM (BEYOND SUNDAY)...
APPEARS THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM DURING THE EARLY PART OF
THE WEEK. 00Z GFS AND 06Z DGEX DIFFER ON TIMING...WITH THE GFS
BEING 6-12 HOURS FASTER. BOTH TRACK UPPER LOW OVER NW AR AND MO...SO
WE WOULD BE IN THE WARM SECTOR WITH ASSOCIATED CHANCE FOR THUNDER.
WILL KEEP POPS IN THE 50 PERCENT AREA FOR TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY
FOR NOW...WITH EXPECTATION THAT AS TIMING BECOMES A LITTLE MORE
FIRM...POPS WILL LIKELY NEED TO BE RAISED IN ONE OR MORE PERIODS.
THUNDER WILL BE MENTIONED...AND IF TRACKS OF MODELS VERIFY...
SEVERE WEATHER NOT OUT OF QUESTION. WITH AREA IN WARM SECTOR...
ADJUSTED TEMPS UPWARD FOR PORTIONS OF EXTENDED. RIGHT NOW...LOOKS
LIKE THINGS SHOULD DRY OUT FOR THANKSGIVING.

740 PM CST THU NOV 18 2004

.UPDATE...
CURRENT FORECAST IS FINE...ALTHOUGH WILL NEED TO UPDATE LATER THIS 
EVENING TO ADJUST FOR RAIN DIMINISHING FROM THE WEST. UPPER LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE IS MOVING THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH THIS EVENING. BACK EDGE OF 
THE MAIN RAIN AREA IS APPROACHING THE MS RIVER FROM THE WEST AT 
ABOUT 25 MPH. THINK LOW CLOUDS AND A CHANCE OF DRIZZLE WILL PERSIST 
THROUGH THE NIGHT AS THE RAIN ENDS. TEMPERATURES SHOULD HOLD STEADY 
OR FALL JUST SLIGHTLY THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. WINDS WILL REMAIN 
GENERALLY FROM THE EAST 5 TO 10 MPH.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 331 PM CST THU NOV 18 2004

SHORT TERM...
TONIGHT...WEAK SURFACE LOW ACROSS LOUISIANA ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER 
LEVEL LOW OVER SOUTHEAST KANSAS WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A CHANCE OF 
RAIN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT. MODEST MID LEVEL FORCING 
/700-500MB Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE/ ALONG WITH LAPSE RATES INCREASING 
TO AROUND 6 C/KM WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF PRECIPITATION AS 500MB 
SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT. RAIN SHOULD TAPER OFF 
TO DRIZZLE LATER TONIGHT ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA AS 
MID/UPPER LEVEL DRY AIR TRIES TO WORK IN.

LONG TERM...PATTERN WILL REMAIN UNSETTLED ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH AS A 
COLD FRONT BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
SOUTHWEST FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...WILL KEEP A 
CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...LATEST EXTENDED MODEL RUNS STILL SHOWING 
TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS...ESPECIALLY BY WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY.  00Z GFS RUN BRINGS LONG WAVE TROUGH A BIT DEEPER ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH AND SLIGHTLY QUICKER THAN PREVIOUS RUN. EUROPEAN RUN 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT BY THURSDAY WITH SURFACE LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION INSTEAD OF A LOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY.

DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE PLOT PLACES WEAK LOW PRESSURE ACROSS NW 
LOUISIANA. 88D RADAR TRENDS FROM AROUND THE MID SOUTH SHOW LIGHT TO 
MODERATE RAIN FALLING ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES. 500MB SHORTWAVE 
WILL SLIDE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. 
700-500 MB LAYER MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL INCREASE TOWARDS 6 C/KM 
BY TONIGHT WITH DECENT MID LEVEL FORCING PRESENT THROUGH TOMORROW 
MORNING. I DON/T THINK THUNDER CHANCES WILL BE THAT GREAT THIS 
AFTERNOON AS LI/S AND SHOWALTER INDICIES WILL REMAIN ABOVE ZERO AT 
LEAST THROUGH EARLY EVENING. VISIBLE SATELLITE TRENDS SHOW FEW IF 
ANY BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE REGION...WHICH WILL KEEP 
THUNDER CHANCES VERY LOW WITH A LACK OF SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. I WILL ISSUE AN UPDATE TO ADJUST POPS BASED 
UPON CURRENT TRENDS.

UPDATED GRIDS WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 230 AM CST THU NOV 18 2004...
TOUGH FORECAST THIS MORNING AS MODELS ARE HAVING A HARD TIME WITH 
AGREEMENT ESPECIALLY WITH THE SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH 
THIS WEEKEND. CURRENT RADAR SHOWS AN AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN 
STRETCHING FROM SOUTHWEST MISSOURI TO LOUISIANA. THIS RAIN IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER OKLAHOMA. THE LOW WILL 
MOVE NORTHEASTWARD TODAY AND WILL SPREAD RAIN OVER THE MIDSOUTH 
TODAY. HAVE A RANGE OF CATEGORICAL POPS IN THE NORTHWESTERN ZONES TO 
CHANCE POPS IN THE EASTERN ZONES. RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE INTO 
TONIGHT AS THE UPPER TROF WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE MIDSOUTH. 
NORTHEASTERN ZONES WILL SEE HIGHEST POPS-HAVE CATEGORICAL GOING IN 
THIS AREA WITH THE REST OF THE CWA HAVING LIKELY POPS. THE CWA 
SHOULD SEE SOMEWHAT OF A BREAK IN RAIN ON FRIDAY...HOWEVER THERE IS 
A STILL A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A FEW SHOWERS OCCURRING. WILL KEEP THE 20 
POP GOING. FRIDAY NIGHT IS WHEN THE MODELS REALLY START SHOWING 
DIFFERENCES. THE ETA SHOWS A COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE 
NORTHWEST WHILE A WARM FRONT WILL BE LOCATED SOUTH OF THE CWA. ON 
SATURDAY THE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH IN FROM THE NORTHWEST AND LOOKS 
LIKE IT WILL HANG OVER THE CWA THROUGH AT LEAST 12Z SUNDAY. THE GFS 
SHOWS A WARM FRONT MOVING NORTHWARD INTO THE CWA ON SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT. THE GFS DOESN/T SHOW THE COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE 
CWA UNTIL SUNDAY. THESE DIFFERENCES COULD LEAVE PARTS OF THE CWA DRY 
DURING PART OF THE WEEKEND OR WET DURING THE ENTIRE WEEKEND. WILL 
TRY TO DO COMPROMISE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BUILD INTO THE CWA ON MONDAY AND BRING DRY CONDITIONS FOR THE EARLY 
PART OF THE WEEK BEFORE ANOTHER UPPER LOW PUSHES OUT OF THE 
SOUTHWEST MID WEEK BRINGING MORE CHANCES FOR RAIN.

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE AND UPPER AIR ANALYSES PLACES HIGH 
PRESSURE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 12Z RAOBS FROM KLZK AND KJAN SHOWS 
SOME MID/HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE PRESENT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. MAIN 
FORECAST CONCERNS FOR THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE CLOUD COVER AND 
TEMPERATURES. 

LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE THIS MORNING SHOWS MID/HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS 
ROTATING AROUND UPPER RIDGE AND CIRRUS SHIELD FROM APPROACHING LOW 
FROM THE PANHANDLE OF TEXAS. WILL MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO CLOUD 
COVER FOR THE AFTERNOON AS CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO SPILL INTO THE 
MID SOUTH. 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 12C THIS MORNING SUPPORT HIGHS 
IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 70S...WHICH CURRENT TEMPERATURE GRIDS ARE 
HANDLING WELL AT THIS TIME. WILL NOT ISSUE AN UPDATED MEMZFPMEG AT 
THIS TIME. 

CJC

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 200 AM CST WED NOV 17 2004.

UPPER RIDGE REMAINS OVER MIDSOUTH THIS MORNING. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP DRY 
CONDITIONS AROUND THE CWA. AREA SHOULD SEE AS MUCH SUN AS YESTERDAY SO WILL GO 
WITH MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS. IN ADDITION...HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A TAD 
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY.

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE TONIGHT AS AN UPPER LOW LIFTS OUT OF TEXAS TOWARD 
THE MIDSOUTH. RAIN FROM THE LOW SHOULD BEGIN TO AFFECT WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE 
CWA THURSDAY MORNING. THE LOW WILL BECOME MORE OF JUST A TROF BY THE TIME IT 
REACHES THE MIDSOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS IS WHEN THE AREA WILL SEE THE BEST 
BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN. WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY POPS EVERYWHERE BUT 
SOUTHEASTERN ZONES. 

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE CWA ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS 
WILL KEEP SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND THE MIDSOUTH.

ON SATURDAY...A WARM FRONT WILL BEGIN TO LIFT NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF COAST. 
THIS WILL SPREAD RAIN INTO PORTIONS OF THE CWA...WITH NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 
SEEING THE BEST CHANCES. THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY AS THE 
WARM FRONT REMAINS OVER NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. 

ON SUNDAY...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH INTO NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA. THE 
FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE NORTHWESTERN HALF OF THE CWA BY SUNDAY NIGHT. NEW 
MODEL RUNS ARE SHOWING THE FRONT HANGING UP OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN HALF OF THE 
CWA THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. WILL ADD PRECIP CHANCES TO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN ZONES FOR MONDAY BUT WILL LEAVE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY DRY FOR A 
FEW MORE MODEL RUNS. COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA BEHIND THE 
FRONT.

THE MIDSOUTH. RAIN FROM THE LOW SHOULD BEGIN TO AFFECT WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE 
CWA THURSDAY MORNING. THE LOW WILL BECOME MORE OF JUST A TROF BY THE TIME IT 
REACHES THE MIDSOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS IS WHEN THE AREA WILL SEE THE BEST 
BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN. WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY POPS EVERYWHERE BUT 
SOUTHEASTERN ZONES. 

ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE CWA ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS 
WILL KEEP SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND THE MIDSOUTH.

ON SATURDAY...A WARM FRONT WILL BEGIN TO LIFT NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF COAST. 
THIS WILL SPREAD RAIN INTO PORTIONS OF THE CWA...WITH NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI 
SEEING THE BEST CHANCES. THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY AS THE 
WARM FRONT REMAINS OVER NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI. 

ON SUNDAY...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH INTO NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA. THE 
FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE NORTHWESTERN HALF OF THE CWA BY SUNDAY NIGHT. NEW 
MODEL RUNS ARE SHOWING THE FRONT HANGING UP OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN HALF OF THE 
CWA THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. WILL ADD PRECIP CHANCES TO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN ZONES FOR MONDAY BUT WILL LEAVE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY DRY FOR A 
FEW MORE MODEL RUNS. COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA BEHIND THE

.DISCUSSION...
CLOUD COVER PROVED TO BE TRICKY TODAY AS MOST LOCATIONS SAW MUCH 
MORE SUN THAN ANTICIPATED YESTERDAY AND EARLIER TODAY. TEMPERATURES 
HAVE RISEN INTO THE LOWER 70S ACROSS PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA DUE 
TO THE LACK OF CLOUD COVER. THE POSITION OF THE RIDGE AXIS ALOFT HAS 
REMAINED NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. 

WE CAN EXPECT MUCH THE SAME WEATHER...PERHAPS SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPS 
FOR BOTH MAX AND MINS WED AND AGAIN THURSDAY. THIS WILL BE DUE TO 
CLOUD COVER OR LACK OF FOR THE AREA AND THE STAGNANT WX PATTERN. 

THE UPPER LOW APPROACHING FAR WEST TEXAS TODAY WILL TRACK ACROSS 
CENTRAL TEXAS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL CAUSE HIGH CLOUDS TO 
STREAM INTO THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS STORM 
SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA...MAINLY 
NORTHEASTERN ARKANSAS THURSDAY AFTERNOON. EXPECT THE RAIN TO SPREAD 
FROM WEST TO EAST ON THURSDAY NIGHT BRINING LIKELY CHANCES OF RAIN 
TO ALL AREAS. WILL CONTINUE WITH MENTIONING CHANCE FOR RAIN THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND AS TRAILING DISTURBANCES IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW COULD 
CREATE AREAS OF RAIN OVER THE REGION. ONE IN PARTICULAR...SKIRTING 
ACROSS THE TX GULF COAST EARLY SATURDAY. THIS TRACKS QUICKLY INTO 
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

ANOTHER COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE APPEARS TO TAKE PLACE ON SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON WITH CHANCES FOR RAIN POSSIBLE. SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY LOOK DRY AT THIS TIME AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA.

HAVE MADE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO CURRENT FORECAST INCLUDING CLOUD

GENERALLY PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON WITH 
POCKETS OF MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS OVER PARTS OF NORTH MISSISSIPPI. 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS CENTERED OVER EAST TENNESSEE.

THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WAS SET UP ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
WHILE TWO STORM SYSTEMS WORK ON THE PERIPHERY. ONE SYSTEM NOW MOVING 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES REGION WILL COMBINE WITH SOME ENERGY 
MOVING AROUND THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AT 850MB

MOISTURE WILL SLOWLY FILL INTO THE NORTHEAST FORECAST AREA THROUGH 
TUESDAY. THUS EXPECTING A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA BEGINNING AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH 
THE DAY TUESDAY. RAIN CHANCES ARE SLIM AND RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD 
BE LIGHT IF THEY OCCUR. ALL MODELS INDICATE WEAK UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT 
ACROSS THIS AREA HOWEVER THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS IN AN AREA OF 
GENERALLY SINKING AIR...I.E. UNDER THE RIDGE AXIS. 

CLOUD COVER OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WILL BE CHALLENGING AS WELL 
AS TEMPERATURES. OVERNIGHT LOWS AND DAYTIME HIGHS HAVE BEEN MUCH 
WARMER THAN GUIDANCE THE PAST SEVERAL RUNS...SO HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR 
THE WARMER THAN GUIDANCE TREND. 

THE UPPER LOW OVER NORTHWESTERN MEXICO WILL SLOWLY TRACK TOWARD THE

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL SLOWLY RETROGRADE
TO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THROUGH THURSDAY AS TWO UPPER LOWS MOVE
OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY THEN
DOWN THE ATLANTIC COASTAL PLAIN AND OFF THE CAROLINA COAST. ANOTHER
LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST WILL EJECT NORTHEASTWARD WEDNESDAY TO THE
CENTRAL PLAINS BY THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM WILL SQUEEZE THE RIDGE
BETWEEN IT AND THE SECOND LOW DIVING DOWN THE ATLANTIC COASTAL PLAIN.
FRIDAY THE RIDGE WILL SHIFT BACK TO THE EASTERN STATES AS THE PLAINS
LOW BECOMES ABSORBED BY A POLAR LOW DROPPING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS
SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA. THIS LOW AND SHORT WAVES ROTATING AROUND IT
WILL CARVE A BROAD TROF OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OVER THE WEEKEND AS
IT HEADS FOR THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES.

AT THE SURFACE A HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL
REMAIN STATIONARY THROUGH TUESDAY AND WEAKEN WEDNESDAY. A LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP OVER WEST TEXAS WEDNESDAY AND MOVE
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE PLAINS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TO THE GREAT
LAKES BY SATURDAY. A TRAILING COLD FRONT WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL
APPROACH THE MID SOUTH FROM THE WEST FRIDAY AND MOVE ACROSS THE

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL SLOWLY RETROGRADE
TO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THROUGH THURSDAY AS TWO UPPER LOWS MOVE
OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY THEN
DOWN THE ATLANTIC COASTAL PLAIN AND OFF THE CAROLINA COAST. ANOTHER
LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST WILL EJECT NORTHEASTWARD WEDNESDAY TO THE
CENTRAL PLAINS BY THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM WILL SQUEEZE THE RIDGE
BETWEEN IT AND THE SECOND LOW DIVING DOWN THE ATLANTIC COASTAL PLAIN.
FRIDAY THE RIDGE WILL SHIFT BACK TO THE EASTERN STATES AS THE PLAINS
LOW BECOMES ABSORBED BY A POLAR LOW DROPPING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS
SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA. THIS LOW AND SHORT WAVES ROTATING AROUND IT
WILL CARVE A BROAD TROF OVER THE ENTIRE COUNTRY OVER THE WEEKEND AS
IT HEADS FOR THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES.

AT THE SURFACE A HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL
REMAIN STATIONARY THROUGH TUESDAY AND WEAKEN WEDNESDAY. A LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP OVER WEST TEXAS WEDNESDAY AND MOVE
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE PLAINS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TO THE GREAT
LAKES BY SATURDAY. A TRAILING COLD FRONT WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL
APPROACH THE MID SOUTH FROM THE WEST FRIDAY AND MOVE ACROSS THE
REGION SATURDAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE FRONT SUNDAY.

THE RESULT WILL BE SEASONABLY COOL AND DRY WEATHER OVER THE MID SOUTH
THROUGH TUESDAY FOLLOWED BY CHANCES OF SHOWERS WEDNESDAY THROUGH
SATURDAY. THE BEST CHANCES OF SHOWERS WILL BE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY

BROAD AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION IS PROVIDING

TOMORROW. FORECAST IS VERY HIGH ON MIN TEMPS TONIGHT AND TOMORROW 
NIGHT AT TUPELO...GOING WITH PERSISTENCE HERE WITH LAST NIGHTS TEMPS 
STAYING UP DUE TO THE CLOUDS AND GUIDANCE PERFORMED POORLY HERE. 

BY TUESDAY...THE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN IN TACT OVER THE

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL DRAG A SHORTWAVE AND WEAK COOL 
FRONT THROUGH THE REGION AROUND MIDWEEK. DYNAMICS ARE WEEK WITH THE

LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM NOW OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WITH SURFACE COLD 
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWARD THROUGH EAST ARKANSAS. A DRY SLOT AHEAD OF 
THE COLD FRONT HAS RESULTED IN PARTLY SUNNY SKIES IN THE DELTA. 18Z 
MESOETA SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS CLEARING CONTINUING EASTWARD ACROSS THE 
MIDSOUTH BEFORE LOW CLOUDS WORK BACK IN DURING THE EVENING FROM WEST 
TO EAST. THERE IS A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS INTO NORTH MISSISSIPPI. THIS LINE IS PINWHEELING AROUND THE 
LOW AND SHOULD CONTINUE OFF TO THE EAST NORTHEAST THROUGH THE 
EVENING. RAISED OVERNIGHT LOWS WITH GUIDANCE PICKING UP ON THE CLOUD 
COVER A LITTLE BETTER THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION 
NOT QUITE AS AGGRESSIVE AS EXPECTED. 

MODEL SOUNDINGS POINT TO LOTS OF LOW STATUS AROUND TOMORROW AND WITH 
COLD AIR POURING IN...EXPECT AREAS OF DRIZZLE TO BE AROUND. MAV 
GUIDANCE ALSO INDICATES THAT THE TEMPS TOMORROW SHOULD REMAIN STEADY 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION WITH THE DAILY HIGHS OCCURRING JUST AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT IN MANY PLACES. ONLY PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MS MAY 
ACTUALLY SEE TEMPS RAISE A FEW DEGREES BECAUSE OF A LATER START IN 
THE STRONGER COLD AIR ADVECTION. HAVE RAISED TEMPS FRIDAY NIGHT ONCE 
AGAIN DUE TO CLOUD COVER.

SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON CLOUDS MAY BEGIN TO MIX 
OUT ACROSS THE REGION...ALTHOUGH ITS STARTING TO BECOME THAT TIME OF 
YEAR WITH FEWER HOURS OF SUN THAT THOSE CLOUDS NEVER GET A CHANCE TO 
MIX OUT. SO WOULDNT BE SHOCKED IF THE CLOUDS HANG AROUND EVEN INTO 
SUNDAY. 

A RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE REGION FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. 
THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO ANOTHER CUT OFF LOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN US. 
THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SLOW ITS MOVEMENT OUT OF THE WESTERN US...SO 
NOW IT LOOKS LIKE IT MAY NOT ARRIVE UNTIL MID TO LATE WEEK.

OUT ACROSS THE REGION...ALTHOUGH ITS STARTING TO BECOME THAT TIME OF

A RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE REGION FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. 
THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO ANOTHER CUT OFF LOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN US.

LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM NOW OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WITH SURFACE COLD 
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWARD THROUGH EAST ARKANSAS. A DRY SLOT AHEAD OF 
THE COLD FRONT HAS RESULTED IN PARTLY SUNNY SKIES IN THE DELTA. 18Z 
MESOETA SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS CLEARING CONTINUING EASTWARD ACROSS THE 
MIDSOUTH BEFORE LOW CLOUDS WORK BACK IN DURING THE EVENING FROM WEST 
TO EAST. THERE IS A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS INTO NORTH MISSISSIPPI. THIS LINE IS PINWHEELING AROUND THE 
LOW AND SHOULD CONTINUE OFF TO THE EAST NORTHEAST THROUGH THE 
EVENING. RAISED OVERNIGHT LOWS WITH GUIDANCE PICKING UP ON THE CLOUD 
COVER A LITTLE BETTER THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION 
NOT QUITE AS AGGRESSIVE AS EXPECTED. 

MODEL SOUNDINGS POINT TO LOTS OF LOW STATUS AROUND TOMORROW AND WITH 
COLD AIR POURING IN...EXPECT AREAS OF DRIZZLE TO BE AROUND. MAV 
GUIDANCE ALSO INDICATES THAT THE TEMPS TOMORROW SHOULD REMAIN STEADY 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION WITH THE DAILY HIGHS OCCURRING JUST AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT IN MANY PLACES. ONLY PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST MS MAY 
ACTUALLY SEE TEMPS RAISE A FEW DEGREES BECAUSE OF A LATER START IN

ONGOING FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS OVER THE

ALSO LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN FROM THE GULF WILL BE ONGOING THIS

TO BE PRETTY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY AND SO FAR THIS LOOKS OKAY. EXPECT 
SCATTERED SHOWERS TO BREAK OUT ACROSS THE REGION THIS EVENING ONCE 
THE BETTER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURNS TO THE AREA AND THE UPPER JET 
MOVES OVERHEAD IN ADVANCE OF THE UPPER LOW. THEN WIDESPREAD RAIN AND 
EMBEDDED THUNDERSHOWERS SHOULD OVERSPREAD AREAS ALONG AND WEST OF

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL MOVE EASTWARD AND
WEAKEN TODAY. AN UPPER LOW OVER THE TEXAS PANHANDLE THIS MORNING WILL
MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS SYSTEM WILL WEAKEN AS
A SHORT WAVE THURSDAY AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. WHEN IT
REACHES THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT IT WILL BECOME PART OF A
LARGE TROF IN THE NORTHEAST. ANOTHER RIDGE WILL BUILD NORTHWARD OVER
THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FRIDAY AND OVER THE WEEKEND
THEN SHIFT TO THE EASTERN STATES MONDAY. A LARGE TROF WILL DEEPEN
OVER THE ROCKYS SUNDAY THEN MOVE ACROSS THE PLAINS MONDAY AND
TUESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL MOVE
EASTWARD TODAY AS A COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE PLAINS.
THIS FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THURSDAY. THE RESULT WILL
BE DRY WEATHER TODAY FOLLOWED BY RAIN AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND THE FRONT WILL SPREAD
COLDER AND DRIER AIR INTO THE MID SOUTH FRIDAY AND CAUSE THE RAIN TO
END. COOLER THAN NORMAL WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND
INTO NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL CAUSE CHANCES

.DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL MOVE EASTWARD AND
WEAKEN TODAY. AN UPPER LOW OVER THE TEXAS PANHANDLE THIS MORNING WILL
MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS SYSTEM WILL WEAKEN AS
A SHORT WAVE THURSDAY AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. WHEN IT
REACHES THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT IT WILL BECOME PART OF A
LARGE TROF IN THE NORTHEAST. ANOTHER RIDGE WILL BUILD NORTHWARD OVER
THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FRIDAY AND OVER THE WEEKEND
THEN SHIFT TO THE EASTERN STATES MONDAY. A LARGE TROF WILL DEEPEN
OVER THE ROCKYS SUNDAY THEN MOVE ACROSS THE PLAINS MONDAY AND
TUESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL MOVE
EASTWARD TODAY AS A COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE PLAINS.
THIS FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THURSDAY. THE RESULT WILL
BE DRY WEATHER TODAY FOLLOWED BY RAIN AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND THE FRONT WILL SPREAD
COLDER AND DRIER AIR INTO THE MID SOUTH FRIDAY AND CAUSE THE RAIN TO
END. COOLER THAN NORMAL WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND
INTO NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL CAUSE CHANCES
OF RAIN SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY.

.UPDATE...

HIGH PRESSURE LOCATED ACRS THE OH AND LOWER MS VALLEYS THIS EVENING. 
CIRRUS STREAMING ACRS THE REGION WITH LIGHT E/SE WINDS AT THE 
SURFACE. LIGHT WINDS COUPLED WITH LOW DEWPOINTS SHOULD HELP TEMPS 
FALL TO FORECAST LOWS. NO CHANGES NEEDED ATTM.

SJM

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 249 PM CST...

THE MIDSOUTH IS IN EASTERLY FLOW AROUND HIGH PRESSURE THAT IS 
CENTERED OVER OHIO. ALOFT...THERE IS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT IS 
MOVING OUT OF THE MOUNTAIN WEST. A RIDGE HAS BEEN BUILDING OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH IN RESPONSE TO THE LOW. CIRRUS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM HAS OVERSPREAD THE REGION. 

LOW TEMPS ACROSS THE REGION SHOULD BE FAIRLY CLOSE TO THOSE OF LAST 
NIGHT. THE CIRRUS MAY KEEP TEMPS UP SLIGHTLY WITH THE GFS AND ETA 
SUGGEST A LITTLE MORE WIND TO HELP KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE MIXED. HAVE 
DOUBTS AS TO HOW MUCH WIND WILL REALLY BE AROUND TONIGHT WITH 
TOPOGRAPHY PLAYING A ROLE AWAY FROM THE DELTA AND WOULDNT BE 
SURPRISED IF TEMPS AROUND JACKSON TN AND TUPELO WERE A COUPLE 
DEGREES COOLER THAN CURRENT FORECAST WHICH IS ALREADY AT OR BELOW 
GUIDANCE.

NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO TOMORROWS FORECAST. ETA AND GFS HINT 
AT A FEW AFTERNOON SHOWERS BREAKING OUT OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS AND 
SPREADING INTO EASTERN ARKANSAS TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THIS APPEARS TO 
BE IN ADVANCE TO GOOD Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE MOVING THROUGH THE 
REGION. HOWEVER BOTH MODELS SHOW THE BETTER CONVERGENCE OVER CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS SO DECIDED TO IGNORE THE MODEL/S SOLUTION OF SPREADING RAIN 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING THROUGHOUT THE 
AFTERNOON WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEGINNING TO RETURN. WITH THAT 
SAID...THERE STILL SHOULD BE ENOUGH SUNSHINE SO THAT AFTERNOON HIGHS 
WILL BE IN THE MID OR UPPER 60S. 

THE AREA OF Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE MOVES INTO THE REGION BY TOMORROW 
NIGHT AND THE UPPER JET SLIDES OVERHEAD. MODELS SHOW THAT LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE WILL BE GREATEST WEST OF A LINE FROM JACKSON TN TO OXFORD. 
THIS IS WHERE THE HIGHEST CONFIDENCE IN RAINFALL HAS BEEN PLACED. 
ANOTHER INTERESTING NOTE IS THAT THERE IS A GREAT DEAL OF LOW LEVEL 
SHEAR AHEAD OF THE SURFACE COLD FRONT WHICH BY 12Z THURSDAY WILL BE 
OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS. ETA 0-3KM HELICITY VALUES ARE IN EXCESS OF 
300 M2/S2 AT 12Z THU AND VALUES REMAIN THAT HIGH THROUGHOUT THE DAY 
ON THURSDAY. FORTUNATELY...IT SHOULD BE VERY CLOUDY WHICH WILL KEEP 
THE INSTABILITY LOW AND LIMIT ANY THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY TO EMBEDDED 
WITHIN THE STRATIFORM RAIN. THIS APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER EXAMPLE OF 
GREAT DYNAMICS BUT LITTLE TO NONEXISTENT INSTABILITY. HAVE HIGH 
CONFIDENCE OF RAIN AREAWIDE ON THURSDAY WITH THE UPPER LOW AND 
EVENTUALLY COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE REGION. WITH RAIN AND CLOUD 
COVER...HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL PROBABLY BE LUCKY TO MOVE MUCH MORE 
THAN 5 DEGREES OFF OF THE MORNING LOW. THE SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL 
SHOULD COME TO AN END THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE LOW BEGINS TO MOVE AWAY 
FROM THE REGION. 

ETA SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF 925MB MOISTURE HANGING AROUND INTO FRIDAY 
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. EXPECT A LOW STRATUS DECK AROUND. 
WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF THERE WAS EVEN A FEW SPRINKLES AROUND WITH 
SOUNDINGS VERY SATURATED THROUGH A 1500FT LAYER...LOW CEILINGS AND 
COLD AIR ADVECTION INTO THE REGION. ETA HINTS AT POSSIBLY SOME 
CLEARING OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS INTO NORTHWEST TN DURING THE DAY ON 
FRIDAY. THERE STILL MAY BE SOME LOW CLOUDS AROUND VERY EARLY ON 
SATURDAY ACROSS NORTH MS BUT THESE SHOULD QUICKLY ERODE AWAY AND 
GIVE WAY TO PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS. FREEZING TEMPERATURES AND FROST 
IS STILL POSSIBLE OVER PORTIONS OF THE REGION SATURDAY AND SUNDAY 
MORNING IF WINDS DIE DOWN ENOUGH. 

BY SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY...THE FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY ALOFT IN 
RESPONSE TO ANOTHER CUT OFF LOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN US. HAVE RAIN 
MENTIONED SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY IN CASE A SHORTWAVE EJECTS 
OUT OF THE LOW AND MOVES THROUGH THE REGION IN THE FLOW.

AROUND 40. LITTLE IF ANY CHANGE EXPECTED TUESDAY WITH SUBSIDENCE 
CONTINUING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE A COUPLE 
OF DEGREES FROM TODAY. SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW WILL BEGIN ON WEDNESDAY 
AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OFF TO THE EAST COAST WITH THE APPROACH OF

TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN HAS SET UP FOR THE MID SOUTH THIS WEEKEND. 
A LONGWAVE RIDGE WILL BE ANCHORED OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS THROUGH 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. A STRONG SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES TODAY. COOL SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW IN THE 
WAKE OF A COLD FRONT WHICH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. EXPECT COOL OVERNIGHT LOWS SUNDAY NIGHT AND AGAIN MONDAY 
NIGHT WITH CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS BOTH NIGHTS.

THE UPPER LOW CURRENTLY LOCATED OFF THE COAST OF CALIFORNIA MAKE ITS 
WAY INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. A CHANCE FOR RAIN 
EXISTS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT.

A DEEP TROUGH FORMING IN THE WAKE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED LOW AND A 
STRONG/COLD CANADIAN HIGH WOULD DROP TEMPERATURES CONSIDERABLY 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. THIS PATTERN HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR EACH RUN 
OF THE GFS AND THE ECMWF STRONGLY AGREES WITH THE PATTERN. 

HAVE ADJUSTED TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY LOWER FOR FRIDAY HOWEVER...IF 
THIS CONSISTENCY CONTINUES THEN MAX TEMPERATURES FRIDAY WILL BE HARD 
PRESSED TO REACH 40 DEGREES. SATURDAY MORNING WOULD BE WELL BELOW 
FREEZING. WILL ONLY TREND FRIDAY AND SATURDAY TEMPS DOWN SLIGHTLY

WAY INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. A CHANCE FOR RAIN 
EXISTS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT.

A DEEP TROUGH FORMING IN THE WAKE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED LOW AND A 
STRONG/COLD CANADIAN HIGH WOULD DROP TEMPERATURES CONSIDERABLY 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. THIS PATTERN HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR EACH RUN 
OF THE GFS AND THE ECMWF STRONGLY AGREES WITH THE PATTERN. 

HAVE ADJUSTED TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY LOWER FOR FRIDAY HOWEVER...IF 
THIS CONSISTENCY CONTINUES THEN MAX TEMPERATURES FRIDAY WILL BE HARD 
PRESSED TO REACH 40 DEGREES. SATURDAY MORNING WOULD BE WELL BELOW 
FREEZING. WILL ONLY TREND FRIDAY AND SATURDAY TEMPS DOWN SLIGHTLY 
FOR NOW AND WATCH THE NEXT COUPLE RUNS.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE EAST ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
TONIGHT. THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD DECOUPLE LATER TONIGHT ACROSS MAINLY
EASTERN SECTIONS ALLOWING WINDS TO GO LIGHT AND TEMPERATURES TO FALL
BACK INTO THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 30S. EXPECT SCATTERED AREAS OF FROST
IN THESE LOCATIONS. ELSEWHERE...EXPECTING WINDS TO STAY UP HIGH
ENOUGH TO ALLOW WARMER AIR BEING ADVECTED IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO
BE MIXED DOWN TOWARD THE SURFACE. THIS SHOULD KEEP SURFACE TEMPS
ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA FROM FALLING OFF TO FAR. ON
SATURDAY...THE AREA WILL BE BACK IN RETURN FLOW WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS
BRINGING IN WARMER TEMPERATURES. 850 MB TEMPS WARM FROM 8-10C UP TO
12-14C BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THIS COUPLED WITH CONTINUED MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES WILL ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURES SATURDAY AFTERNOON TO
REBOUND BACK INTO THE 70S.

FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEKEND...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT SHOULD
CONTINUE OVER THE AREA. AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE IN THE NORTHERN
STREAM WILL DIG DOWN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST U.S. THIS IMPULSE WILL
HELP TO SEND A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE DAY SUNDAY.
NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF MOISTURE FOR THIS FRONT TO WORK WITH...SO
SHOULD COME THROUGH DRY. TEMPERATURES WILL FALL OFF A FEW DEGREES
FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...AS HIGH PRESSURE RE-ESTABLISHES
CONTROL OVER THE REGIONS WEATHER.

FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OFF OF
THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST THIS WEEKEND WILL BEGIN TO LIFT OUT
ACROSS THE DESERT SOUTHWEST AND INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES BY
THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. THIS SYSTEM WILL SEND A COLD FRONT EASTWARD.
LOW LEVEL RETURN FLOW SHOULD SET UP ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT...
BRINGING AN INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING
FRONT. EXPECT THE COLD FRONT TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY...
BRINGING INCREASED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY.
CURRENT MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SHOWING A MUCH COLDER AIRMASS MOVING IN
BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE END OF NEXT WEEK. HAVE COOLED TEMPERATURES
SOMEWHAT FOR THIS TIME PERIOD...BUT WOULD PREFER TO SEE A FEW MORE
MODEL RUNS AND SOME TRENDS BEFORE GOING ANY LOWER THAN CURRENTLY
ADVERTISED FOR THE END OF NEXT WEEK AND WEEKEND.

A DRY NORTHWEST FLOW CAN BE EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. A BROAD TROUGH SITS ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. WHILE A 
LONGWAVE RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. THIS IS IN RESPONSE TO 
THE CUT OFF LOW SPINNING OVER NORTH/CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WHICH SLOWLY 
DIGS INTO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THROUGH SATURDAY. 

THE WESTERN STORM SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TRANSLATING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE U.S. AND APPROACH THE MID SOUTH. A CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. A STRONG 
NORTHERN STREAM WAVE IS PROGGED TO HELP DEEPEN THE TROUGH OVER THE 
EASTERN U.S. BY THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS SPELLS COLD TEMPERATURES FOR 
NEXT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...SOMETHING TO WATCH ANYWAY. 

CONCERN FOR FROST IS MINIMAL TONIGHT ACROSS PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. THE LIGHT NORTHERLY WINDS TODAY WILL SHIFT TO THE SOUTHWEST 
OVERNIGHT AT 5 TO 10 MPH. THE COOLEST TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL 
LIKELY BE IN THE UPPER 30S ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST FORECAST AREA WHERE 
WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE. ALSO...THE 1000-500MB THICKNESS

DROP TO AROUND 2C WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 
60S. 

TONIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION. 1000-500MB RH/S

CWA. GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO FALL BACK 
INTO THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S WITH WINDS STAYING UP A BIT AS THE 
AREA WILL BE ON THE EDGE OF NORTHWEST CYCLONIC FLOW. 

FRIDAY...LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITIES AROUND 20 PERCENT /PER 1000-500 MB

WILL WILL ALLOW WINDS TO DECOUPLE. HOWEVER WITH 850MB TEMPERATURES

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES LOW PRESSURE CENTER 
ACROSS SOUTHERN LOUISIANA WITH STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS SOUTHERN 
MISSISSIPPI AND CENTRAL ALABAMA. INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS 
QUITE A BIT OF STRATUS HOVERING AROUND 1KFT. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS 
TODAY WILL BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND TEMPERATURES.

TODAY...SHORT TERM MODELS IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH OVERALL HANDLING 
OF LOW OVER LOUISIANA. SURFACE LOW WILL LIFT NORTHEAST INTO 
MISSISSIPPI AND WESTERN TENNESSEE. MODEL SOUNDINGS ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH SUGGEST THAT RAINFALL CHANCES WILL REMAIN DECENT ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE CWA THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER ACROSS 
THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA...MID/UPPER LEVEL SUBSIDENCE WILL 
GRADUALLY TRY TO BUILD IN TO THE AREA. CURRENT 88D TRENDS SHOW A 
LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS...TRACKING TO THE 
NORTHEAST. I TAPERED POPS OFF BY THIS AFTERNOON WITH LIKELY POPS 
ACROSS THE SOUTH...AND SCATTERED POPS ELSEWHERE. WITH AMPLE LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE IN PLACE...TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO GET OUT OF 
THE 60S THIS AFTERNOON UNDER CLOUDY SKIES. 

TONIGHT...LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE OFF INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. UPPER 
LEVEL LOW WILL PROVIDE SOME MID LEVEL FORCING /700-500 MB Q-VECTOR 
CONVERGENCE...THOUGH DRY SLOT WILL BE BUILDING IN BEHIND THE UPPER 
LEVEL LOW AND MOISTURE WILL BECOME MORE LIMITED AS THE EVENING 
PROGRESSES. AS A RESULT...PRECIPITATION WILL FALL AS ISOLATED RAIN 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF AND SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS EAST. 
1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S WILL INCREASE BACK TO AROUND 60 PERCENT...AND 
WILL GO WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THAT WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES UP A 
BIT. 

THURSDAY...COOL HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE MID 
SOUTH. MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST LOW CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO BREAK UP 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO AROUND 
0C SUPPORTING HIGHS AT BEST IN THE UPPER 50S BUT THINK LINGERING 
CLOUD COVER WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES DOWN A COUPLE OF DEGREES.

THURSDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO SETTLE IN ACROSS THE 
REGION. 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL DROP DOWN TO AROUND 0C. TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD DROP WITH CLEAR/MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND DECENT RADIATIONAL 
COOLING. SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL DIP INTO THE MID TO UPPER 30S IN 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

NO CHANGES MADE TO LONG RANGE FORECAST (FRIDAY AND BEYOND) AS 
SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL RESULT IN MOSTLY SUNNY/PARTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS MUCH OF THE MID SOUTH THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT

A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER MISSOURI THIS AFTERNOON WILL
CONTINUE TO LIFT NORTHEAST INTO THE MIDWEST THROUGH TUESDAY. A WARM
FRONT EXTENDS EAST FROM THE LOW OVER THE MIDWEST WITH A STRONG COLD
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS SOUTHEAST KANSAS...CENTRAL
OKLAHOMA...AND INTO NORTH-CENTRAL TEXAS. A PRE-FRONTAL SQUALL
LINE HAS DEVELOPED FROM SOUTHEAST MISSOURI SOUTHWARD ACROSS ARKANSAS
AND INTO PORTIONS OF LOUISIANA TODAY. THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST INTO OUR AREA THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.
THERE WILL BE A THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE
AREA THIS EVENING AS THE LINE PROGRESSES EAST. SPC HAS THE WESTERN
PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH HIGHLIGHTED IN THE DAY 1 SLIGHT RISK
OUTLOOK. ALSO A TORNADO WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR WESTERN
PORTIONS OF THE AREA. ALTHOUGH INSTABILITY IS MARGINAL ACROSS THE
THREAT AREA...STRONG WIND FIELDS HAVE ALLOWED FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF
SMALL BOWING SEGMENTS AND ISOLATED SUPERCELLS. THE PRIMARY THREAT
ACROSS THE TORNADO WATCH AREA THIS EVENING WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS
AND ISOLATED TORNADOES.

THE STRONG COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVING EAST TONIGHT AND SLOWLY
PASS ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH ON TUESDAY. A POTENT UPPER
LOW WILL LIFT NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES INTO THE MIDWEST
THROUGH THURSDAY. THE FRONT WILL STALL ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI ON
TUESDAY AFTERNOON. UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER
LOW WILL HELP INDUCE A SECONDARY SURFACE LOW THAT WILL TRAVERSE
NORTHEAST ALONG THE STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY. AHEAD OF THESE
WEATHER SYSTEMS...ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL ADVECT NORTHWARD.
THIS COMBINED WITH THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE UPPER SYSTEM ALL SPELLS
THE THREAT FOR HEAVY RAIN ACROSS THE AREA. HAVE EXTENDED THE FLOOD
WATCH THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY. WIND FIELDS STILL LOOK STRONG ACROSS
PORTIONS OF WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI ON TUESDAY...
SO SOME SEVERE THREAT MAY STILL EXIST ACROSS THESE AREAS AGAIN
TOMORROW...ALTHOUGH INSTABILITY WILL BE HELD DOWN AGAIN BY RAIN AND
CLOUDS.

BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM LIFTS TO OUR NORTHEAST
WITH DRY AND COOL HIGH PRESSURE MOVING IN. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL

UPPER LOW OVER NEW MEXICO THIS MORNING WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE OUT

THERE HAS BEEN SOME ISOLATED SEVERE ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
ARKANSAS THIS MORNING IN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LINE.

LOOKING AT SEVERE PARAMETERS...IT APPEARS THAT INSTABILITY WILL BE
HELD DOWN ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH PLENTY OF
CLOUD COVER IN PLACE AND UPPER LOW STAYS WELL TO OUR WEST. ALTHOUGH
INSTABILITY NOT IMPRESSIVE...LOW LEVEL WIND FIELDS ARE QUITE STRONG
SO SEVERE POTENTIAL DOES EXIST ACROSS AREAS MAINLY WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER FOR THIS AFTERNOON...WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND
ISOLATED TORNADOES STILL POSSIBLE. THESE AREAS ARE UNDER THE DAY 1
SLIGHT RISK FROM SPC.

DUE TO THE SLOW EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PRE-FRONTAL SQUALL LINE...

CLOUD COVER IN PLACE AND UPPER LOW STAYS WELL TO OUR WEST. ALTHOUGH
INSTABILITY NOT IMPRESSIVE...LOW LEVEL WIND FIELDS ARE QUITE STRONG
SO SEVERE POTENTIAL DOES EXIST ACROSS AREAS MAINLY WEST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER FOR THIS AFTERNOON...WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND
ISOLATED TORNADOES STILL POSSIBLE. THESE AREAS ARE UNDER THE DAY 1
SLIGHT RISK FROM SPC.

DUE TO THE SLOW EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PRE-FRONTAL SQUALL LINE...
HAVE DROPPED POPS SLIGHTLY ACROSS AREAS EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER. ALSO DROPPED TEMPS SLIGHTLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST AREAS DUE TO
CLOUD COVER. UPDATES TO THE FORECAST WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

HOWEVER...THE 06Z MESOETA PRESENTLY COMING IN CONTINUES TO SLOW THE
PROGRESS OF THE COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. IF THIS TREND
CONTINUES...LATER FORECASTS LIKELY WILL BE ABLE TO DELAY THE FLOOD
WATCH FOR PARTS OF WEST TN AND NORTH MS...BUT MAY NEED TO EXTEND IT
FURTHER IN TIME. NEVERTHELESS...A VERY WET PATTERN IS STILL IN STORE
FOR THE MIDSOUTH THE FIRST PART OF THIS WEEK. SYNOPTIC SCALE UPPER

THEN MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT
WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA TUESDAY AND STALL THROUGH NORTHERN MS.

FOR TODAY...WARM FRONT LOCATED WEST TO EAST THROUGH NORTHEAST AR

THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH IN THE WARM SECTOR. HIGHEST POPS WILL BE OVER
EASTERN AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL DECREASING TOWARD NORTHEAST MS. AN

NORTHEAST AR FROM THE SOUTHWEST TODAY. CAPES ARE FORECAST TO ONLY
CLIMB TO BETWEEN 500 AND 1000 J/KG. IF MORE SUNSHINE IS RECEIVED THAN
EXPECTED...CAPES WILL BE HIGHER. HELICITY VALUES ARE FORECAST TO
REACH 240 TO 360 M2/S2 WITH GOOD DIRECTIONAL SHEAR THIS AFTERNOON
ACROSS EASTERN AR. MEANWHILE...850 MB JET IS FORECAST TO INCREASE TO
50 KNOTS FROM THE SOUTH BY 00Z ACROSS EASTERN AR. THUS...COULD HAVE

REACHED. SPC HAS EASTERN AR...EXTREME WEST TN AND EXTREME NORTHWEST

HEAVY RAIN IS FORECAST TO SPREAD INTO EASTERN AR THIS AFTERNOON
AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH STRONG LARGE SCALE LIFT DEVELOPING AHEAD
OF THE UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE FRONT. THE HEAVY RAIN WILL GRADUALLY
SPREAD INTO WEST TN AND NORTH MS TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY.

AFTER COORDINATING WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES...HAVE RAISED POPS
CONSIDERABLY FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. SURFACE LOW

A VERY ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN CAN BE EXPECTED ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
FOR THE FIRST PART OF THIS WEEK. A FRONTAL SYSTEM STRETCHES FROM
NORTHERN MS WESTWARD INTO SOUTHERN AR THIS MORNING. SATELLITE AND
RADAR INDICATE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SPREADING
NORTHEAST OF THIS FRONT INTO THE MIDSOUTH THIS MORNING.
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS ALOFT ARE CAUSING GOOD WARM AIR ADVECTION OVER
THIS FRONT. WILL INCREASE POPS FOR THIS MORNING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH.
THE FRONT WILL GRADUALLY PUSH NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT TODAY. BY
THIS AFTERNOON...THE GREATEST THREAT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
WILL BE TO THE NORTH OF THE FRONT FROM NORTHEAST AR INTO NORTHWEST
TN. THE REMAINDER OF THE MIDSOUTH WILL GRADUALLY PUSH INTO THE WARM
SECTOR WITH MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY STILL SUFFICIENT FOR SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS.

GFS/ETA ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT CONCERNING THE WEATHER FOR
TONIGHT INTO THE MIDDLE OF THIS WEEK...AND MOSTLY AGREES WITH OUR
CURRENT FORECAST. A STRONG LOW LEVEL SOUTH WIND FLOW WILL SET UP
ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT PUSHING ABUNDANT MOISTURE INTO THE
AREA. MEANWHILE...A STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE
MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH
THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT. MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN SHOWING A
BAND OF HEAVY RAIN SPREADING INTO EASTERN AR/MO BOOTHEEL BY MONDAY
AFTERNOON...THEN ACROSS ALL THE MIDSOUTH MONDAY NIGHT. CONSIDERING
THE RAINFALL WE WILL BE RECEIVING TODAY AND TONIGHT...WILL ISSUE A
FLOOD WATCH FOR EASTERN AR AND THE MO BOOTHEEL MONDAY...ALL OF OUR
FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT. THINK RAINFALL TOTALS MONDAY AND
TUESDAY COULD RANGE BETWEEN 2 AND 4 INCHES. IN ADDITION...SEVERE
WEATHER IS STILL OF CONCERN. MODEL INSTABILITY VALUES ARE
MARGINAL. NEVERTHELESS...VERY STRONG WIND WIND...INCREASING
DIFFLUENCE ALOFT...AND INCREASING LOW LEVEL HELICITY SUPPORTS
THE RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY. SPC INDICATES
THE GREATEST THREAT WILL BE FROM ABOUT THE MS / TN BORDER SOUTHWARD.

MUCH COOLER AIR WILL SPILL INTO THE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY WITH
TEMPERATURES MOST LIKELY FALLING DURING THE DAY. THE UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH WITH SHOWERS LIKELY.

IN THE EXTENDED...WILL NEED TO KEEP ANY EYE ON FORECAST LOWS FOR
NEXT SATURDAY MORNING. LATEST MEX GUIDANCE IS INDICATING A LOW OF 32
DEGREES FOR JACKSON WHICH WOULD BE THE FIRST FREEZE OF THE SEASON.

BAND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEEN PROGRESSIVELY MOVING
EASTWARD ACROSS ARKANSAS DURING THE NIGHT. THESE SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS ARE AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT THAT STRETCHES FROM
SOUTHEASTERN MO TO SOUTHWESTERN AR THIS MORNING. SATELLITE SHOWS
WARMING OF THE TOPS ACROSS NORTHEASTERN AR...BUT STILL INDICATES
RATHER COLD TOPS EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF
AR. THINK THE TREND WILL BE A GRADUAL WEAKENING AND DECREASE OF THE
STORMS AS THEY MOVE WELL AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND INTO A MORE STABLE
ATMOSPHERE EARLY THIS MORNING. WILL NEED TO ADJUST THE MORNING
FORECAST BASED ON CURRENT ACTIVITY. LATER THIS MORNING...WITH
DAYTIME HEATING...THINK THE CONVECTION WILL INCREASE SOMEWHAT AGAIN
AS IT MOVES ACROSS PARTS OF WEST TN AND NORTH MS. DRIER AIR WILL
BE SPREADING INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST DURING THE DAY BEHIND THIS
CONVECTION.

BY TONIGHT...THE FRONT WILL BECOME STATIONARY WEST TO EAST ACROSS OUR
EXTREME SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF NORTH MS. MUCH LOWER SURFACE DEWPOINTS
WILL HAVE SPREAD OVER MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH ALLOWING FOR A COOLER
NIGHT. WILL KEEP 20 TO 30 PERCENT POPS FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE
MIDSOUTH.

ON SUNDAY...AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL PUSH ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
GIVING WESTERN AREAS THE HIGHEST CHANCE OF RAIN. IN ADDITION...
OVERRUNNING OF THE FRONT WILL BEGIN AS 850 MB WINDS TURN MORE TO
THE SOUTH. WILL INCREASE POPS ACROSS EASTERN AR.

SUNDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...A VERY WET PERIOD. THE FRONTAL SYSTEM
WILL PUSH BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT SUNDAY NIGHT.
MEANWHILE...A STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL MOVE ONLY SLOWLY THROUGH
THE MIDSOUTH THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK. AN ASSOCIATED STRONG COLD
FRONT WILL ALSO MOVE SLOWLY THROUGH THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE TO
MONITOR THE THREAT OF HEAVY RAIN AND POTENTIAL FLOODING. THERE WILL
ALSO BE THE CHANCE OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PART OF THE
MIDSOUTH WITH A STRONG WIND FIELD DEVELOPING. MAIN HINDRANCE FOR
SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE FORECAST MARGINAL INSTABILITY AS SHOWN BY THE
ETA/GFS LIFTED INDICES.

CURRENT FORECAST PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK. PREFRONTAL LINE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT WERE OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS EARLIER THIS 
EVENING HAS ESSENTIALLY DISSIPATED AS IT MOVED INTO SOMEWHAT MORE 
STABLE AIR AND LOSS OF THE DIURNAL HEATING. NOW AWAITING THE LINE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHWEST MISSOURI THROUGH NORTHWEST ARKANSAS AND 
SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA TO ARRIVE. THESE THUNDERSTORMS INITIATED ALONG A 
SURFACE COLD FRONT THAT IS ROUGHLY ALONG I-44. SINCE THEN THEY HAVE 
MOVED OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH AN UPPER SHORTWAVE THAT IS 
OUTRUNNING THE FRONT. 00Z MESOETA SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE 
SITUATION. EXPECT THE LINE TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EASTWARD DUE TO 
TIME OF DAY AND DYNAMICS BECOMING DISJOINTED WITH THE BETTER FORCING 
WELL NORTH OF THE REGION. EXPECT THAT THE LINE OR AT LEAST WHAT 
REMAINS OF IT TO ARRIVE INTO THE REGION SOMETIME AFTER 3 AM. TEMP

A VERY MILD DAY HAS TAKEN SHAPE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH AS A STRONG 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE HAS REMAINED OVER THE AREA TODAY. UPSTREAM...A 
VIGOROUS SHORTWAVE OVER THE HIGH PLAINS CONTINUES TO PROGRESS 
EASTWARD ALONG WITH ITS ATTENDANT COLD FRONT...CURRENTLY OVER 
EASTERN NEBRASKA TO WEST CENTRAL TEXAS.

THE FRONT AND SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST TONIGHT. AN AREA 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS EXPECTED TO BREAK OUT TONIGHT OVER 
EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND WESTERN ARKANSAS. THIS ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY 
SPREAD INTO NE ARKANSAS BEFORE 12Z...THEREFORE HAVE INTRODUCED 
LIKELY POPS THERE. FURTHER SOUTH AND WEST...FEEL ONLY CHANCE POPS 
WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. WITH THE UPPER RIDGE HOLDING FIRM...THE BEST 
DYNAMICS WILL MOVE WELL NORTH OF THE AREA...ALLOWING THE LINE TO 
WEAKEN AS IT PROGRESSES EASTWARD.

THE FRONT SHOULD ALSO BEGIN TO SLOW DOWN MIDDAY SATURDAY AS THE 
UPPER FLOW BECOMES PARALLEL TO THE FRONT. ETA/GFS HAS COME INTO A 
LITTLE BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE FRONT STALLING JUST SOUTH OF OUR 
CWA. WITH THE FRONT IN THE VICINITY OF OUR SOUTHERNMOST 
COUNTIES...WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THAT AREA. NORTHERN AREAS 
SHOULD BE DRY AND COOL SATURDAY NIGHT AS THEY WILL BE NORTH OF THE 
FRONT.

ETA/GFS ARE ALSO BEGINNING TO AGREE ON THE FRONT SURGING BACK NORTH 
AS A WARM FRONT SUNDAY NIGHT IN RESPONSE TO THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL 
SYSTEM DEEPENING OVER NEW MEXICO AND TEXAS. A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN 
WILL LIKELY ACCOMPANY THE WARM FRONT WITH GOOD MOISTURE TRANSPORT 
BECOMING ESTABLISHED.

ONE WORD CAN SUM UP THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK...WET. UPPER LEVEL 
SYSTEM OVER TEXAS WILL ONLY VERY SLOWLY MOVE EAST ON MONDAY. WITH 
FRONT BISECTING THE AREA...SEVERAL SURFACE WAVES RIDING ALONG THE 
FRONT...AND GOOD UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE SETTING UP...EXPECT 
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA. AS IT STANDS 
NOW...HEAVY RAIN MAY BE A BIGGER THREAT THAN SEVERE WEATHER. 
UNIDIRECTIONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL SUPPORT HEAVY RAIN. GIVEN ABUNDANCE 
OF CLOUDS AND RAIN...IT MAY LESSEN THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT. WILL 
UPDATE THE HWO TO FRESHEN THE WORDING.

LATEST MODEL DATA CONTINUES TO SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF THIS 
SYSTEM...WITH RAIN LIKELY CARRYING THROUGH TUESDAY AND MAYBE EVEN 
INTO WEDNESDAY. HAVE RAISED POPS FOR THESE TIMES UP TO 40/50 
PERCENT AND WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE THESE RAISED HIGHER AS WE 
GET CLOSER TO THE EVENT. SYSTEM WILL LIFT OUT BY THURSDAY...WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE AND COOLER AIR FILTERING IN THROUGH SATURDAY.

PATCHY DENSE FOG HAS BEEN LIMITED TO AROUND THE TUPELO AREA THIS
MORNING...EXTENDING NORTHWARD INTO THE SOUTHEAST PART OF WEST TN
BASED ON SATELLITE. SURFACE GRADIENT HAS ALLOWED SOUTH WIND ELSEWHERE
TO KEEP VISIBILITIES UP. WILL MENTION THE PATCHY DENSE FOG FOR PART
OF NORTHEAST MS / SOUTHEAST CORNER OF WEST TN FOR EARLY THIS
MORNING.

AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DOMINATE OUR
WEATHER TODAY. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CAPPED...AND WILL
CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR TODAY. ALTHOUGH CAN NOT TOTALLY
RULE OUT A RENEGADE THUNDERSTORM DUE TO AFTERNOON HEATING. HIGH
TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL CLIMB TO NEAR RECORD HIGHS.

A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST TONIGHT.
UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WILL PULL OFF TO THE NORTHEAST WITH THE FRONT
BECOMING PARALLEL TO THE UPPER FLOW TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. THINK A
WEAKENING BAND OF SHOWERS / POSSIBLY THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE INTO
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THE MO BOOTHEEL AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. THE
FRONT WILL CONTINUE SLOWLY THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH SATURDAY BEFORE
STALLING THROUGH NORTHERN MS SATURDAY NIGHT. THE GFS INDICATES A
FASTER AND FURTHER SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT THAN THE
MESOETA...BUT AT THIS TIME WILL FOLLOW THE MESOETA WITH THE FRONT
SLOWING AND BECOMING PARALLEL TO THE UPPER FLOW. WILL CONTINUE WITH 
A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE 
MIDSOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT.

ON SUNDAY...WILL STICK WITH OUR CURRENT FORECAST WHICH HAS 20
PERCENT POPS NORTH TO 30 PERCENT SOUTH. FRONTAL SYSTEM REMAINS
STALLED WEST TO EAST THROUGH NORTHERN MS WITH WEAK OVERRUNNING
DEVELOPING ACROSS MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH AS SHOWN BY THE MESOETA.
CONFIDENCE DOES DECREASE BY THIS TIME AS THE GFS IS MORE AGGRESSIVE
IN DEVELOPING PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY.

SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY TUESDAY BECOMES VERY INTERESTING AND MOST
LIKELY VERY WET. STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH PUSHES INTO THE
PLAINS. 850 MB FLOW INCREASES FROM THE SOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY
WITH STRONG OVERRUNNING OF THE SURFACE FRONT DEVELOPING ACROSS MUCH
OF THE MIDSOUTH. A SURFACE LOW IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP TO OUR
SOUTHWEST AND MOVE ACROSS NORTH MS MONDAY NIGHT. GFS INSTABILITY
VALUES ARE ONLY BETWEEN ZERO AND MINUS ONE. HOWEVER...STRONG UPPER
LEVEL WINDS AND INCREASING HELICITY WITH THE APPROACHING SURFACE
LOW WILL AID IN THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PART
OF THE AREA. WILL MENTION THE THREAT OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AND
HEAVY RAIN FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...BUT THIS WILL ALL DEPEND
ON THE EVENTUAL EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM.

THE GFS INDICATES THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE SLOWER TO
MOVE OUT OF OUR AREA TUESDAY THAN PRESENTLY INDICATED BY THE ZONES /
GRIDS. WILL ADD A CHANCE TO EASTERN AREAS TUESDAY. LATER FORECAST
MAY NEED TO INCLUDE FOR THE ENTIRE MIDSOUTH TUESDAY AS THE UPPER

.DISCUSSION...

THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE MOVED EAST OF THE CWA AND ARE 
DISSIPATING AS WELL. MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS ARE OCCURRING WITH A 
LIGHT WARM MOIST SOUTHERLY BREEZE.

A DEEP SUBTROPICAL HIGH CENTERED ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL EXTEND 
NWD ACROSS THE LWR MS VLY OVERNIGHT. EXPECT UNSEASONABLY WARM MOIST 
CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL WITH LIGHT WINDS. WITH THE LONGER NIGHTS OF 
LATE OCTOBER...EXPECT PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE FOG 
WILL BE MOST DENSE IN AREAS WHICH HAD RAIN DURING THE DAY.

THE DEEP HIGH WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
ALLOWING FOR INCREASED SOUTHERLY WINDS AND CONTINUED WARM 
CONDITIONS. THE HIGH WILL STILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO KEEP PARTLY TO 
MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY EVENING.

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. NOT MUCH MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
FRONT BUT WILL KEEP A 20 TO 30 POP IN NORTHWESTERN HALF OF CWA 
FRIDAY NIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT.

FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVING THROUGH CWA ON SATURDAY. WILL CONTINUE 
WITH A 20 POP FOR ENTIRE CWA. FRONT BECOMES STALLED OUT IN EXTREME 
SOUTHEASTERN ZONES SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE IT BEGINS TO WORK ITS WAY 
NORTHWARD ON SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AS A WARM FRONT. THE WARM FRONT 
WILL BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BACK FOR THE ENTIRE 
MIDSOUTH BY SUNDAY.

ON MONDAY...THE MIDSOUTH WILL SEE THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN AS THE

THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE MOVED EAST OF THE CWA AND ARE 
DISSIPATING AS WELL. MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS ARE OCCURRING WITH A 
LIGHT WARM MOIST SOUTHERLY BREEZE.

A DEEP SUBTROPICAL HIGH CENTERED ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL EXTEND 
NWD ACROSS THE LWR MS VLY OVERNIGHT. EXPECT UNSEASONABLY WARM MOIST 
CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL WITH LIGHT WINDS. WITH THE LONGER NIGHTS OF 
LATE OCTOBER...EXPECT PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE FOG 
WILL BE MOST DENSE IN AREAS WHICH HAD RAIN DURING THE DAY.

THE DEEP HIGH WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
ALLOWING FOR INCREASED SOUTHERLY WINDS AND CONTINUED WARM 
CONDITIONS. THE HIGH WILL STILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO KEEP PARTLY TO 
MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY EVENING.

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. NOT MUCH MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
FRONT BUT WILL KEEP A 20 TO 30 POP IN NORTHWESTERN HALF OF CWA 
FRIDAY NIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT.

FRONT WILL CONTINUE MOVING THROUGH CWA ON SATURDAY. WILL CONTINUE 
WITH A 20 POP FOR ENTIRE CWA. FRONT BECOMES STALLED OUT IN EXTREME 
SOUTHEASTERN ZONES SATURDAY NIGHT BEFORE IT BEGINS TO WORK ITS WAY 
NORTHWARD ON SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AS A WARM FRONT. THE WARM FRONT 
WILL BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BACK FOR THE ENTIRE 
MIDSOUTH BY SUNDAY.

ON MONDAY...THE MIDSOUTH WILL SEE THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN AS THE 
NEXT COLD FRONT PUSHES THROUGH MOST OF THE CWA. PRECIP WILL LINGER 
IN EASTERN ZONES MONDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT PUSHES ENTIRELY THROUGH 
THE CWA.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY BRINGING DRY

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE FOUND ACROSS MUCH OF THE
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY TO OUR WEST
ACROSS MUCH OF CENTRAL AND WESTERN ARKANSAS. WILL INCREASE POPS FOR
TONIGHT TO 40-50 RANGE FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. MODELS BRING A
SHORTWAVE OVER THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE FOR THURSDAY. WITH CURRENT WARM
MOIST ATMOSPHERE IN PLACE DO NOT SEE WHY WE WONT SEE MORE COVERAGE
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY SO HAVE GONE WITH LIKELY POPS.

THERE WILL BE SOMEWHAT OF A BREAK FROM THE RAIN THURSDAY NIGHT AND
FRIDAY AFTER SHORTWAVE EXITS THE REGION. AND EVEN WITH A BREAK...
THERE WILL STILL BE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND. BY FRIDAY NIGHT...
UPPER LEVEL LOW NOW OVER CENTRAL CALIFORNIA WILL HAVE REACHED THE
NORTHERN PLAINS AND A SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING OUR
REGION BRINGING MORE RAIN WITH IT. AT THIS POINT...IT DOES NOT
APPEAR THAT THEY WILL BE MUCH OF A SEVER WEATHER THREAT AS THE
DYNAMICS WILL BE WELL NORTH OF THE REGION. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY
APPEARS TO STALL OUT ON SATURDAY AND THEN RETREAT NORTH AS A WARM
FRONT ON SUNDAY. ADJUSTED POPS ON SATURDAY NIGHT TO INDICATE A
CHANCE OF RAIN ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA DUE TO THE
UNCERTAINTY OF THE FRONT DURING THAT TIME.

THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPS OUT WEST OVER THE WEEKEND AND
THEN SLAMS IN THE REGION ON MONDAY. UNLIKE THE SYSTEM FOR FRIDAY
NIGHT AND SATURDAY...THE DYNAMICS WILL NOT BE TOO FAR NORTH AND THE
THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER SEEMS MORE AND MORE POSSIBLE WITH EACH

A CLOSED UPPER HIGH WILL REMAIN ANCHORED OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO
WITH A RIDGE EXTENDING NORTHWARD OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN
STATES. A SERIES OF UPPER LEVEL IMPULSES WILL RIDE THE RIDGE FROM
TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA ACROSS ARKANSAS TO THE OHIO VALLEY. BY FRIDAY
THE RIDGE WILL SHIFT EASTWARD AS A VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE MOVES FROM
THE ROCKYS NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THE RIDGE WILL
FLATTEN OUT OVER THE WEEKEND AND THE UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME ZONAL.
THE UPPER FLOW WILL AMPLIFY AGAIN AS ANOTHER TROF MOVES ACROSS THE
WESTERN STATES MONDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A WEAK WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE MID
SOUTH THIS MORNING AND MERGE WITH A STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDING FROM
THE TEXAS PANHANDLE ACROSS OKLAHOMA AND MISSOURI TO THE GREAT LAKES.
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL COVER THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN STATES AHEAD
OF THE FRONT. THE STATIONARY FRONT WILL SAG SLOWLY SOUTHWARD ACROSS
THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY BUT NEVER MAKE IT TO THE
MID SOUTH. A LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL DEVELOP OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS
AND PUSH IT BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. A
WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE SATURDAY AND
EARLY SUNDAY.

THE RESULT WILL BE WARMER THAN NORMAL AND HUMID WEATHER THIS WEEK
WITH CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY THROUGH SATURDAY.

FEATURES THAT WILL MOST IMPACT THE REGION TONIGHT ARE ALOFT. AN 
UPPER LONG WAVE TROUGH IS DIGGING INTO THE WEST COAST. THIS IS 
AMPLIFYING A RIDGE OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL US AND TAPPING INTO THE 
SUBTROPICAL JET WHICH IS POSITIONED OVER THE MIDSOUTH. SURFACE AND 
LOW LEVEL FEATURES ARE RELATIVELY WEAK. THERE IS LIKELY A STALLED 
FRONT STILL OVER THE REGION THAT IS MORE OR LESS A DEW POINT 
BOUNDARY. CONVECTION IS OCCURRING OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND HAS 
BEEN TRYING TO SPILL OVER INTO THE REGION. AS THIS CONVECTION MOVES 
EASTWARD IT SHOULD GRADUALLY FALL APART DUE TO SUBSIDENCE OVER 
EASTERN HALF OF THE REGION DUE TO ITS POSITION TO THE RIDGE AXIS. 
STILL...THERE WILL BE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSHOWERS AROUND 
MOST OF THE NIGHT WITH THE BETTER CHANCES BEING IN AND WEST OF THE 
DELTA. JUST SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST WITH 
A GOOD DEAL OF CLOUDS MOVING OVER THE REGION AND DEW POINTS OVER 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS A LITTLE HIGHER THAN EXPECTED. AS A RESULT THE 
MOST NOTICEABLE IMPACTS TO THE TEMP FORECAST ARE OVER NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS.

WARM FRONT HAS PUSHED NORTHWARD DURING THE DAY WITH DEWPOINTS RISING 
INTO THE MID TO UPPER 60S EXCEPT FOR NW TN AND THE MO BOOTHEEL. IN 
THE UPPER LEVELS...THE MIDSOUTH CONTINUES TO BE UNDER SW FLOW WITH 
THE CENTER OF THE 500MB RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. SMALL 
SHORTWAVES CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA UNDER THIS 
FLOW...HELPING TO PRODUCE THE SCATTERED SHOWER AND TSTM ACTIVITY 
SEEN TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE EVIDENT ON WATER VAPOR OVER NE TEXAS 
WILL MOVE INTO ARKANSAS TONIGHT. GFS MAV GUIDANCE SHOWING LIKELY TO 
CATEGORICAL POPS OVER THE REGION. ON THE OTHER HAND...ETA MOS ONLY 
SHOWING A CHANCE OVER MOST AREAS. THE TRUTH LIKELY FALLS SOMEWHERE 
IN THE MIDDLE. BELIEVE GFS IS SUFFERING FROM FEEDBACK PROBLEMS. 
WESTERN PORTION OF CWA WILL LIKELY BE MOST AFFECTED BY SHORTWAVE  
TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY WITH THE HIGHER DEWPOINTS IN THAT REGION. WENT 
WITH CHANCE OVER THESE LOCATIONS...TAPERING TO SLIGHT CHANCE OVER 
FAR EAST ZONES. SOME AREAS OF PATCHY FOG AND LOW STRATUS ARE ALSO A 
POSSIBILITY OVERNIGHT PARTICULARLY OVER AREAS THAT SAW RAIN TODAY. 
DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL BE WIDESPREAD OR DENSE ENOUGH TO MENTION IN 
ZONES...BUT WILL PASS ON TO THE EVENING SHIFT FOR FURTHER REVIEW.

TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...FRONTAL BOUNDARY STALLS JUST NORTH OF THE 
CWA. UPPER LEVEL IMPULSES RIDING THROUGH THE SW TO WSW FLOW WILL 
INTERACT WITH THE BOUNDARY TO PRODUCE CHANCES OF RAIN...MAINLY OVER 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

ON FRIDAY...ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE AND COLD FRONT WILL MAKE 
ITS APPROACH TO THE MIDSOUTH. 12Z GFS MUCH SLOWER WITH THE FRONT 
THAN THE 00Z RUN AND ACTUALLY AGREES FAIRLY WELL WITH THE 00Z ECMWF. 
HOWEVER...THE 00Z GFS ENSEMBLES AGREED WITH THE 00Z GFS IN A QUICKER 
FRONTAL PASSAGE. TO SUM IT UP...DID NOT MAKE MANY CHANGES TO THE 
EXTENDED UNTIL TIMING ISSUES BECOME BETTER RESOLVED. WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED TO SEE THE SLOWER SOLUTION VERIFY GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF 
THE EAST COAST RIDGE. DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES...CONTINUE TO INDICATE 
CHANCE POPS LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY.

THE COLD FRONT WILL LIKELY STALL JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA BY 
SUNDAY...WITH A BREAK IN THE PRECIP. ANOTHER FRONT IS ADVERTISED BY 
THE GFS TO CROSS THE REGION NEXT MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. GIVEN SOME 
MODEL CONSISTENCY IN THIS...HAVE ADDED CHANCE POPS FOR THAT TIME

THE FRONT SHOULD LIFT WELL NORTH OF THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY WITH THE 
UPPER RIDGE REMAINING IN CONTROL OF THE REGION. 850 TEMPS AROUND +14 
SUPPORTING TEMPS IN THE 80S FOR MID WEEK. THE 06Z AND 12Z RUNS OF 
THE GFS ARE ABOUT 12 HOURS SLOWER IN THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT COLD 
FRONT THAT WILL IMPACT THE REGION. HAVE PUSHED POPS BACK INTO FRIDAY

AN ILL-DEFINED AND DECAYING COLD FRONT EXTENDS THROUGH WEST TN AND 
NORTHWEST MS TODAY. ATMOSPHERE IS TOO DRY FOR THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT ALTHOUGH CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT RESULTING IN PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES ALONG AND JUST AHEAD OF THIS BOUNDARY IS POSSIBLE LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON. TEMP FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK FOR TODAY WITH MODEL 
SOUNDING SUPPORTING TEMPS IN THE MID 70S TO NEAR 80. LATEST UPDATE 
WAS TO ADJUST THE WINDS WHICH ARE EASTERLY BEHIND THE FRONT...LIKELY 
DUE TO A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND 
SOUTHEAST MO. FIRST GLANCE AT THE EXTENDED FORECAST LOOKS LIKE THE 
COLD FRONT TO ARRIVE LATER IN THE WEEK IS ABOUT TWELVE HOURS SLOWER 
THAN YESTERDAY AND HAVE ADJUSTED THE FORECAST ACCORDINGLY.

UPDATE SHORTLY TO REMOVE PRECIPITATION WORDING AND TO ADUST FOR 
CURRENT TRENDS. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT PRODUCED MINI 
SUPERCELLS AND A BOW ECHO FROM A LOW CAPE/HIGH SHEAR ENVIRONMENT 
HAVE MOVED OFF TO THE EAST. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THE REST OF

CURRENT SURFACE DEWPOINTS AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT ARE IN THE

COLD FRONT BEGINNING TO PUSH INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON. A 
LINE OF SHOWERS WITH A FEW EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS IS STRETCHING FROM 
PARIS TENNESSEE TO WEST HELENA ARKANSAS. THIS LINE WILL CONTINUE 
MOVING EASTWARD THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING. BIG QUESTION OF 
THIS FORECAST PACKAGE IS WILL ANYTHING REDEVELOP BEHIND THIS LINE. 
REGIONAL RADAR IS SHOWING A FEW SMALL SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHERN 
MISSOURI. DON/T KNOW IF THIS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP SOUTHWARD OR 
NOT. MODELS ARE SHOWING PRECIPITATION ONLY ACROSS EASTERN AREAS OF 
THE CWA THIS EVENING.  WILL WAIT TO MAKE A LAST MINUTE CALL WHETHER 
TO KEEP POPS ACROSS WESTERN ZONES OR NOT.

CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO DECREASE OVERNIGHT ALLOWING FOR SOME FOG TO 
DEVELOP ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. WILL KEEP MENTION OF FOG IN FORECAST.

SFC HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY IN ADDITION 
TO AN UPPER RIDGE ALOFT. THIS WILL KEEP DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAR/PARTLY 
CLOUDY CONDITIONS AROUND THROUGH MONDAY.

A WARM FRONT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE NORTHWARD INTO SOUTHWESTERN SECTIONS 
OF THE CWA ON MONDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT WILL BRING SLIGHT CHANCES FOR 
SHRA/TSRA THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT MAINLY FOR SOUTHWESTERN TO WESTERN 
PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH BEFORE LIFTING NORTHWARD. 

WARM FRONT WILL BE FAR ENOUGH NORTH WITH COLD FRONT FAR ENOUGH WEST 
TO KEEP THE MIDSOUTH DRY THROUGH THURSDAY. ALTHOUGH EXPECT PARTLY TO 
MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS DURING THIS TIME.

COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND WILL BRING 
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE CWA THROUGH FRIDAY

DENSE FOG COVERS MUCH WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI THIS 
MORNING. WL EXTEND THE ADVISORY UNTIL 9 AM AND REMOVE SOME NORTHWEST 
COUNTIES WHERE DRIER AIR SEEMS TO BE LIMITING FOG DEVELOPMENT. WL 
ALSO ADD MISSISSIPPI COUNTY AR ALONG WITH TIPTON AND LAUDERDALE 
COUNTIES IN TENNESSEE SINCE VSBYS HAVE CRASHED THERE AS WELL. 

EXPECT LOW CLOUDS AND FOG THIS MORNING TO GIVE WAY TO PARTLY SUNNY 
SKIES TODAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS BUILDS ACRS THE REGION AND 
THE SURFACE FLOW BEGINS TO TURN TOWARD A MORE SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. 
14-16C 850 MB TEMPS WL YIELD ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS WITH HIGHS IN THE 
UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S. 

THE NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES TONIGHT. A STRONG TROF WL MOVE INTO THE 
UPPER MS VALLEY WHILE THE ASSOCD COLD FRONT PUSHES TOWARD THE LOWER 
MS VALLEY BY 12Z SAT. A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS WL LIKELY DEVELOP 
AHEAD OF THIS FRONT AND MOVE ACRS THE MID SOUTH LATE FRI NIGHT AND 
SAT. SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL QUESTIONABLE ATTM. INSTABILITY WL BE 
MARGINAL DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND MODERATE LAPSE RATES. ETA CAPES IN 
THE 500-1000 J/KG RANGES WITH LIFTED INDICES -2C TO -4C. MID LEVEL 
WINDS ARE A LITTLE MORE IMPRESSIVE WITH 50 KTS AT 500 MB. COULD SEE 
SOME DAMAGING WIND...PERHAPS LARGE HAIL IF MORE SFC HEATING OCCURS 
THAN EXPECTED. 

MODELS IN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WITH SYSTEM AND BOTH MOVE THE FRONT 
THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. PRECIP WL LINGER ACRS NE MS IN THE 
EVENING WITH SKIES CLEARING. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN BEHIND 
FRONT SETS THE STAGE FOR SOME FOG...ESPECIALLY IF FRONT DEPOSITS THE 
EXPECTED 1 INCH OR SO OF RAIN. 

SUNDAY LOOKS LIKE A PLEASANT DAY WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AND LOW 
1000-500 MB MEAN RH VALUES. ON MONDAY A WEAK COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO 
THE AREA AND MODELS SHOWING A WEAK SFC WAVE DEVELOPING OVER THE 
ARKLATEX AND PUSHING INTO CNTRL MS. WL ADD CLOUDS AND A SLIGHT CHC

CURRENT THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY LOCATED OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST
PART OF THE FORECAST SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE OUT OF THE AREA DURING
THE NEXT HOUR AND SHOULD NOT FACTOR INTO THE NEW FORECAST. DENSE FOG
HAS ALREADY FORMED OVER A GOOD BIT OF THE REGION WITH VISIBILITIES
ALREADY DOWN TO 1/2 MILE AT MEMPHIS. DENSE FOG ADVISORY IS ALREADY
IN PLACE AND AT THIS TIME SEE NO REASON TO CHANGE IT.

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO DIG SOUTH TOWARD SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA WHILE RIDGE BUILDS OVER TEXAS. THE TROUGH WILL EVENTUALLY
PULL EAST AND THEN NORTHEAST BY SATURDAY. MODELS SLOW THE TIMING OF
THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT A FEW HOURS BUT SHOULD NOT MAKE THAT MUCH

CURRENT THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY LOCATED OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST
PART OF THE FORECAST SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE OUT OF THE AREA DURING
THE NEXT HOUR AND SHOULD NOT FACTOR INTO THE NEW FORECAST. DENSE FOG
HAS ALREADY FORMED OVER A GOOD BIT OF THE REGION WITH VISIBILITIES
ALREADY DOWN TO 1/2 MILE AT MEMPHIS. DENSE FOG ADVISORY IS ALREADY
IN PLACE AND AT THIS TIME SEE NO REASON TO CHANGE IT.

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO DIG SOUTH TOWARD SOUTHERN
CALIFORNIA WHILE RIDGE BUILDS OVER TEXAS. THE TROUGH WILL EVENTUALLY
PULL EAST AND THEN NORTHEAST BY SATURDAY. MODELS SLOW THE TIMING OF
THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT A FEW HOURS BUT SHOULD NOT MAKE THAT MUCH
OF A DIFFERENCE IN THE TIMING OF THUNDERSTORMS IN THE REGION.

MISSISSIPPI TONIGHT. A WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS REMAINS TO THE SOUTH OF

MISSISSIPPI AHEAD OF THE LOW. EVEN THOUGH LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY HAS
INCREASED ACROSS AREAS SOUTH OF THE FRONT...NOT EXPECTING

HAVE DECIDED NOT TO MENTION ANY PRECIP ACROSS NORTH MS FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON DUE TO EXTENSIVE CLOUDS HOLDING DOWN HEATING.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION
ISSUED 1000 AM CDT WED OCT 20 2004
 
88D KNQA SHOWS SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH A 
WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE ARE PRESENTLY MOVING OUT OF NORTHWEST 
TN INTO MIDDLE TN.  

WEAK SURFACE COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM ABOUT SAVANNAH TN TO CLARKSDALE 
TN THIS MORNING. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL ALLOW THIS FRONT TO 
CONTINUE MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHEASTWARD THIS AFTERNOON. LOW CLOUDS 
COVER THE MIDSOUTH AT MID-MORNING WITH FOG PERSISTING. VISIBILITIES 
ARE SLOWLY IMPROVING AND THINK THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE TREND. 
LOOKING AT THE MODELS RELATIVE HUMIDITY FORECAST...THINK CLOUDS WILL 
PERSIST MUCH OF THE DAY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH...PERHAPS BREAKING UP 
FASTER THIS AFTERNOON IN THE WARM SECTOR ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH MS. 
WILL ALSO NEED TO LOWER TEMPERATURES ABOUT 6 OR 7 DEGREES FOR MUCH 
OF THE AREA...MAINLY NORTH OF THE FRONT. LATEST RUC MODEL 
INDICATES SOME PRECIPITATION COULD BREAK OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT THIS 
AFTERNOON WHICH SEEMS REALISTIC. WILL ADD A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO PARTS OF NORTH MS THIS AFTERNOON. 
STRENGTH OF THESE STORMS WILL DEPEND ON HOW MUCH SUNSHINE CAN BREAK 
OUT...BUT AT THIS TIME DO NOT EXPECT ANYTHING SEVERE.           

DISCUSSION...

BIGGEST FORECAST ISSUE IS THE NEXT FEW HOURS. SATELLITE SHOWS A WEAK

BUSY NIGHT HERE WITH SEVERE WEATHER THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE DAY HERE.
WARM FRONT NOW WELL NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND COLD FRONT NOW
EXTENDS ACROSS NORTHWEST ARKANSAS INTO EASTERN OKLAHOMA. THIS
BOUNDARY WILL EVENTUALLY SINK SOUTH THROUGH THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY
MORNING. DO EXPECT SOME ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT TODAY AS
THE FRONT MAKES ITS SOUTH. SPC DOES HAVE SLIGHT RISK FOR SOUTHEAST
2/3RDS OF FORECAST AREA.

BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BEGIN TO TAKE CONTROL OVER
TEXAS AND SHOULD HELP DRY THINGS OUT HERE. HAVE REMOVED POPS FROM
FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL
BE FRIDAY NIGHT AS COLD FRONT APPROACHES REGION. WILL NOT ISSUE

.SHORT TERM...LATEST SURFACE PLOT SHOWS SURFACE WARM FRONT 
STRETCHING FROM EAST CENTRAL MISSOURI INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 
SURFACE DEWPOINTS ACROSS THE REGION RANGE FROM THE MIDDLE 60S INTO 
THE LOWER 70S. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING SCATTERED CU/AC 
FIELD ACROSS MUCH OF ARKANSAS AND LOUISIANA. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN 
TONIGHT IS SEVERE THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL. RUC ANALYSIS INDICATES 700 
MB TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE LOWER/MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
OVERNIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL INDICATE A DECENT AMOUNT 
DIRECTIONAL SHEAR WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT WITH 
0-3KM SRH VALUES AROUND 200 M2/S2...LI/S AROUND -5...AND CAPES 
AROUND 2500 J/KG. HOWEVER WITH WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWING UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGING BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...SEVERE POTENTIAL 
MAY BECOME SOMEWHAT LIMITED AS THE EVENING PROGRESSES. 

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY...MID/UPPER LEVEL SHEAR AXIS WILL SLIDE ACROSS 
LOUISIANA AND MISSISSIPPI. LIFTING MECHANISM WILL BE HARDER TO COME 
BY AS MID LEVEL RIDGING WILL BE PRESENT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. A 
MODIFIED SURFACE PARCEL PRODUCES SURFACE BASED CAPES IN EXCESS OF 
2500 J/KG...LI/S AROUND -7...AND PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 
1.5 INCHES. 850MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 16C SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 
70S TO LOWER 80S. THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL DIMINISH TUESDAY NIGHT 
AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BUILDS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. DEWPOINTS IN THE 
MID 60S TO LOWER 70S WILL KEEP LOWS QUITE MILD. 

WEDNESDAY...THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE AGAIN DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AS CAPES ABOVE 2500J/KG...RELATIVELY LIGHT 850-500 MB WIND 
FIELDS...AND LI/S AROUND -6. NO MAJOR FOCUSING MECHANISM WILL BE 
PRESENT WITH MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING AND THINK THAT ANY SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WOULD BE VERY ISOLATED.

THURSDAY THROUGH THROUGH MONDAY...MAIN DIFFERENCES BETWEEN CURRENT 
AND PREVIOUS LONG RANGE MODELS WITH LONG WAVE TROUGH PASSAGE SHOW 
EUROPEAN QUICKER...AND GFS A LITTLE DEEPER. IT LOOKS LIKE THE FRONT 
STALLING OUT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AND MOVING BACK NORTH AS A WARM

POSSIBLY MOVING INTO NORTHWEST SECTIONS TUESDAY NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY
MORNING. AS IMPULSES MOVE OUT OF THE SOUTHWESTERN TROF...PERIODS OF

SEVERE THUNDERSTORM POTENTIAL. WARM FRONT CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS 
MISSISSIPPI AND ARKANSAS WILL LIFT NORTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA INTO 
THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.  850MB THETA-E RIDGE WILL MOVE NORTH ACROSS THE 
MID SOUTH OVERNIGHT WITH 700-500 MB LAYER LAPSE RATES BECOMING 
MODERATE TO STEEP ACROSS THE AREA (6.5-7.0 C/KM). A 35KT LOW LEVEL 
JET WILL DEVELOP ACROSS ARKANSAS AND MOVES ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE 
OVERNIGHT. CAPES AROUND 1500-2000 J/KG...LI/S AROUND -3...SHOWALTER 
INDICIES BELOW ZERO POINT TO ELEVATED SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS BEING THE 
PRIMARY MODE OF SEVERE CONVECTION. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL OCCUR EARLY 
ON TONIGHT AS WARM FRONT STEADILY MAKES PROGRESS TO THE NORTH. 

&&

.LONG TERM...

MONDAY...ANOTHER DAY OF SEVERE WEATHER CONCERNS ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH...ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTERNOON IF THERE IS A DECENT AMOUNT 
OF SUNSHINE. A 500MB VORT MAX WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING 
THE AFTERNOON. LI/S WILL INCREASE TO BETWEEN -6 TO -8...CAPES 
BETWEEN 1500-2000 J/KG AND STEEP LAPSE RATES (7.0+ C/KM). 0-6 KM 
BULK SHEAR VALUES AROUND 40KTS...BULK RICHARDSON NUMBERS AROUND 15 
AND FAVORABLE 0-3 KM SHEAR SUGGEST CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP INTO 
SUPERCELLS AS THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMES VERY UNSTABLE WITH THE DAYTIME 
HEATING. NEARLY UNIDIRECTIONAL WINDS WITH LOW LEVEL JET (40KTS) 
OVERHEAD AND 50 KT 500MB WINDS AND DRY AIR ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS 
SUGGEST THAT OGOING CONVECTION WILL LIKELY FORM INTO A LINE OF 
BOWING SEGMENTS INTO MONDAY NIGHT. 850 MB TEMPERATURES WARMING TO 
AROUND 17C BY 00Z TUESDAY WILL PUSH HIGHS INTOI THE LOWER 80S ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

TUESDAY...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...IT LOOKS LIKE UNSETTLED WEATHER 
WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH FOR QUITE AWHILE AS WARM AND 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS REMAINS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK. 
MODEL RUNS OF THE GFS AND EUROPEAN OVER THE PAST ONE TO TWO DAYS 
HAVE SLOWN DOWN THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY UNTIL FRIDAY/SATURDAY. AS A RESULT...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS 
GOING FOR THURSDAY AS THE AREA WILL REMAIN IN SOUTHWEST FLOW WITH 
APPROACHING LONG WAVE TROUGH DEEPENING AND RESULTANT AMPLIFICATION 
OF RIDGE OUT AHEAD OF IT. NEARLY ALL OF THE LONG RANGE MODELS POINT 
TO THE FRONT STALLING OUT OR MOVING BACK NORTH AS A WARM FRONT BY

.SHORT TERM...LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS CIRRUS/ALTOSTRATUS 
CLOUDS CONTINUING TO STREAM DOWN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE 
BASE OF AN 120 KT UPPER LEVEL JET OVERHEAD. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN 
TONIGHT WILL BE CLOUD COVER...AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.

305-310K ISENTROPIC SURFACES SHOW SOME ISENTROPIC ASCENT OVERNIGHT 
AS A MID LEVEL VORT MAX DEVELOPS ACROSS MISSISSIPPI. WILL HAVE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SPRINKLES TOWARDS DAYBREAK ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE 
FAR SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE KEPT UP A BIT 
IN THE 40S AS SOME CLOUD COVER PERSISTS INTO SUNDAY.

.LONG TERM...UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL CHANGE THIS WEEK FROM A ZONAL 
FLOW TO SOUTHWEST FLOW LATER IN THE WEEK AS A TROUGH DEEPENS ACROSS 
THE ROCKIES AND AFFECTS WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TOWARDS THE 
END OF THE WORK WEEK. 

SUNDAY...AS PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED ABOVE...A WEAK VORTMAX WILL DEVELOP 
AND AFFECT CENTRAL AND PORTIONS OF NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI ON 
SUNDAY...AND SUBSEQUENTLY ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS 
ACROSS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER THAN SATURDAY.

SUNDAY NIGHT...WARM FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE IN 
THE EVENING AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL 
BEGIN TO INCREASE INTO THE 60S. 700-500MB LAPSE RATES WILL INCREASE 
TO AROUND 6.5 C/KM BY 12Z MONDAY WITH CAPES INCREASING TO 1500-2000 
J/KG. THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MAINLY ELEVATED WITH HAIL BEING THE MAIN 
THREAT. 

MONDAY...WEATHER COULD GET INTERESTING BY THE AFTERNOON IF THERE IS 
ENOUGH SUNSHINE AFTER THE WARM FRONTAL PASSAGE EARLIER IN THE DAY. 
ANOTHER WEAK BOUNDARY WILL PASS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING THE 
AFTERNOON. MODERATE TO STEEP 700-500 MB LAPSE RATES /6.5 C/KM OR 
BETTER/...0-6 KM BULK SHEAR VALUES 50-60 KTS...CAPES 
2000-3000J/KG...AND A DECENT AMOUNT OF SHEAR SUGGEST THAT SUPERCELLS 
WOULD BE THE MOST LIKELY MODE OF SEVERE CONVECTION. HEAVY RAIN IS 
ALSO POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AT OR ABOVE 1.5 INCHES...K 
INDICIES AT OR NEAR 35...AND 1000-500MB RH/S AROUND 65 PERCENT.  

TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...EXPECT UNSETTLED WEATHER ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA UNTIL THE WEEKEND AS WEAK DISTURBANCES IN THE 
SOUTHWEST FLOW PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH EACH DAY. LATEST 00Z RUN OF THE GFS/EUROPEAN TRENDING 
SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUN WITH PASSAGE OF A STRONGER COLD FRONT ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY MORNING. AGAIN...IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST 
FORCING WILL MOVE OFF TO THE NORTHEAST INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY AND DID NOT RAISE POPS ABOVE SCATTERED AT THIS TIME.

MOISTURE WILL BE NORTH OF THE AREA...BUT PLAN TO KEEP POPS WHERE
THEY ARE AT FOR NOW. WITH WINDS BACK TO THE SOUTH BY SUNDAY
EVENING...CURRENT FORECAST TEMPS LOOK WAY TOO LOW...BY AT LEAST 2
CATEGORIES. HIGH TEMPS MONDAY VERY DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER. WITH
FULL SUN...MAV MAX TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE ON MONDAY...BUT FEEL THERE
WILL BE ENOUGH CLOUDS TO HOLD DOWN A LITTLE. WILL UNDERCUT MAV
GUIDANCE...BUT THIS WILL STILL BE WARMER THAN CURRENT FORECAST. &&

.LONG TERM (BEYOND MONDAY)...
SOUTHWEST FLOW THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. CURRENT POP FORECAST IN
LINE WITH OUR NEIGHBORS. TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL IMPULSES THIS FAR OUT
IS IFFY AT BEST. SOUTHWEST FLOW THIS TIME OF YEAR GENERALLY MEANS
WARMER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES. CURRENT GRID PACKAGE BRINGS COOL
FRONT THROUGH ABOUT THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT ONLY COOLING BACK TO NEAR
NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS MID/HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS

MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW MID/HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASING BUT LOW 
LEVELS WILL REMAIN QUITE DRY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SPRINKLES 
POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT FOR A SMALL PORTION OF THE NORTHERN FORECAST 
AREA. PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES 
UP A FEW DEGREES FROM THIS MORNING/S LOWS. 

.LONG TERM... 

SATURDAY...WEAK SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED CLOUDINESS WILL MOVE OFF TO 
THE EAST AS RIDGING BEGINS TO BUILD IN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 850MB 
TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO AROUND 5-6C IN THE AFTERNOON...PRODUCING 
HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE 60S TO LOWER 70S. 

SUNDAY...WARM FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH LOW DEVELOPING OVER THE ROCKIES 
WILL BEGIN TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY EARLY MONDAY. BEST 
MID AND UPPER LEVEL FORCING /850 MB LOW LEVEL JET AND ASSOCIATED 
UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE/ WILL BE NORTH OF THE REGION. NEGATIVE

SUPPORT A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS. AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS THAT A 
BOWING SEGMENT WOULD DEVELOP ACROSS THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN PLAINS AND 
MOVE EAST BUT THINK MOISTURE WILL BE A LIMITING FACTOR AS THE LINE 
FALLS APART BEFORE REACHING THE MORE STABLE AIR ACROSS THE FORECAST

UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DIG INTO THE MIDSOUTH TODAY BRINGING
CLOUDY AND RAINY CONDITIONS. A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS COULD ALSO 
OCCUR AS THE LOW MOVES INTO THE CWA. EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE THIS 
MORNING AS THE LOW APPROACHES. WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA SHOULD 
START SEEING CHANCES FOR RAIN AROUND 15Z WITH EASTERN PORTIONS 
STAYING DRY UNTIL THE AFTERNOON HOURS. CLOUDS AND SHOWERS WILL KEEP 
HIGH TEMPERATURES DOWN. THINK HIGHS WILL HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING 
OUT OF THE 50S. 

TONIGHT...THE LOW WILL PUSH EASTWARD. SHOWERS WILL STILL LINGER 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA IN THE EVENING BUT AFTER MIDNIGHT ONLY THE 
NORTHEASTERN ZONES SHOULD STILL SEE A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS. CLOUDS 
SHOULD DECREASE TO PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR WESTERN PORTIONS OF 
THE CWA BY FRIDAY MORNING.

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE 
MIDSOUTH AND BRING MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS TO THE 
AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY WARM-UP DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.

FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...MODELS ARE SHOWING A DIFFERENT 
SOLUTION THAN YESTERDAY WITH REGARDS TO THE NEXT FRONTAL PASSAGE. 
MODELS ARE NOW SHOWING RAIN WITH A WARM FRONT ON SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT 
WITH A COLD FRONT ON MONDAY HANGING UP OVER THE CWA AS SEVERAL LOWS 
DEVELOP AND MOVE ALONG IT. THIS COULD KEEP RAIN CHANCES GOING 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP FORECAST AS IS UNTIL MODELS BECOME MORE 
CONSISTENT. CURRENT FORECAST HAS RAIN CHANCES MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

.UPDATE...
LOW CLOUDS CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD OUT OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS
EVENING. CLOUDS PERSIST FROM THE EASTERN PARTS OF WEST TN INTO
NORTHEAST MS...BUT THESE WILL BE OUT OF AREA IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.
PROBABLY WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR FOR MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH THROUGH EARLY
THURSDAY MORNING. MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING
LATE TONIGHT AHEAD OF AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DIGGING AND APPROACHING
FROM THE WEST.

WINDS HAVE BECOME LIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH CURRENT TEMPERATURES
IN THE 50S. CURRENT FORECAST OVERNIGHT LOWS FROM THE MID 40S TO NEAR
50 LOOKS GOOD.

WILL UPDATE GRIDS/ZONES FOR MINOR CHANGES IN TONIGHTS FORECAST.


.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 305 PM CDT WED OCT 13 2004

WRAP AROUND CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY
WILL CLEAR OUT OF THE MIDSOUTH FROM WEST TO EAST AS THE UPPER LOW
QUICKLY MOVES EAST. A BREAK FROM THE CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF
THE NIGHT ALLOWING TEMPS TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 40S AND LOWER 50S.
CLOUDS WILL QUICKLY MOVE BACK IN DURING THE MORNING HOURS AS THE
POTENT TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT
BEGIN TO QUICKLY ADVANCE TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH.

ETA AND GFS BOTH SHOW THE TROUGH DEVELOPING INTO A CLOSED LOW AS IT
DIGS INTO NE OKLAHOMA AND NW ARKANSAS OVERNIGHT. THE LOW THEN
QUICKLY MOVES EAST...BRINGING THE BEST DYNAMICS ACROSS THE AREA
DURING THE AFTERNOON TOMORROW. UPPER VERTICAL MOTION WILL BE VERY
STRONG...THEREFORE WENT WITH LIKELY POPS ACROSS THE BOARD
TOMORROW...TAPERING THEM OFF THROUGH THE COURSE OF TOMORROW EVENING.
THE MODELS DO DIFFER ON THE LOCATION OF THE LOW...THE ETA BEING
FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS. THIS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT A
DEFORMATION BAND OF RAIN MAY TRY TO SET UP ON THE NORTH AND EAST
SIDE OF THE LOW. WHERE THIS BAND SETS UP COULD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER
TEMPERATURES (DUE TO DYNAMICAL COOLING) AND BRING HIGHER RAINFALL
TOTALS. WILL HAVE TO TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH ON THIS PARTICULAR

SECONDARY FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING BUT NO
RAIN IS EXPECTED DUE TO A DRY ATMOSPHERE. TEMPERATURES MODERATE OVER

THURSDAY). FAST ZONAL FLOW WILL SET UP MAKING THE TIMING OF
SHORTWAVES VERY DIFFICULT. HENCE...THE MODELS ARE ALSO DISAGREEING
ON THE TIMING AND PLACEMENT OF THESE FEATURES. GFS HAS BEEN
INCONSISTENT...SO WILL LEAN TOWARD THE MORE CONSISTENT ECMWF. WILL
CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS MONDAY THROUGH EARLY TUESDAY AS A

.UPDATE...
LOW CLOUDS CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD OUT OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS
EVENING. CLOUDS PERSIST FROM THE EASTERN PARTS OF WEST TN INTO
NORTHEAST MS...BUT THESE WILL BE OUT OF AREA IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS.
PROBABLY WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR FOR MUCH OF THE MIDSOUTH THROUGH EARLY
THURSDAY MORNING. MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING
LATE TONIGHT AHEAD OF AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DIGGING AND APPROACHING
FROM THE WEST.

WINDS HAVE BECOME LIGHT ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH WITH CURRENT TEMPERATURES
IN THE 50S. CURRENT FORECAST OVERNIGHT LOWS FROM THE MID 40S TO NEAR
50 LOOKS GOOD.

WILL UPDATE GRIDS/ZONES FOR MINOR CHANGES IN TONIGHTS FORECAST.


.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 305 PM CDT WED OCT 13 2004

WRAP AROUND CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LOW OVER THE OHIO VALLEY
WILL CLEAR OUT OF THE MIDSOUTH FROM WEST TO EAST AS THE UPPER LOW
QUICKLY MOVES EAST. A BREAK FROM THE CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF
THE NIGHT ALLOWING TEMPS TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 40S AND LOWER 50S.
CLOUDS WILL QUICKLY MOVE BACK IN DURING THE MORNING HOURS AS THE
POTENT TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT
BEGIN TO QUICKLY ADVANCE TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH.

ETA AND GFS BOTH SHOW THE TROUGH DEVELOPING INTO A CLOSED LOW AS IT
DIGS INTO NE OKLAHOMA AND NW ARKANSAS OVERNIGHT. THE LOW THEN
QUICKLY MOVES EAST...BRINGING THE BEST DYNAMICS ACROSS THE AREA
DURING THE AFTERNOON TOMORROW. UPPER VERTICAL MOTION WILL BE VERY
STRONG...THEREFORE WENT WITH LIKELY POPS ACROSS THE BOARD
TOMORROW...TAPERING THEM OFF THROUGH THE COURSE OF TOMORROW EVENING.
THE MODELS DO DIFFER ON THE LOCATION OF THE LOW...THE ETA BEING
FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS. THIS COULD BE SIGNIFICANT GIVEN THAT A
DEFORMATION BAND OF RAIN MAY TRY TO SET UP ON THE NORTH AND EAST
SIDE OF THE LOW. WHERE THIS BAND SETS UP COULD SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER
TEMPERATURES (DUE TO DYNAMICAL COOLING) AND BRING HIGHER RAINFALL
TOTALS. WILL HAVE TO TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH ON THIS PARTICULAR
FEATURE. FORECAST MODEL SOUNDINGS DO SHOW THAT FROZEN PRECIP COULD
FALL AS LOW AS 850MB...BUT THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE WAY TOO WARM

UPPER LOW CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER SE MO/W KY WILL CONTINUE PUSHING

AROUND THE MIDSOUTH. THERE ARE A FEW SHOWERS NEAR THE LOW CENTER. 
CAN/T RULE OUT A FEW SPRINKLES FALLING ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES SO 
WILL MENTION SPRINKLES IN FORECAST. BY AFTERNOON...SHOULD SEE A 
DECREASE IN CLOUDS AS THE LOW CENTER PUSHES FURTHER EAST. SKIES 
SHOULD BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY IN ALL BUT NORTHEASTERN ZONES.

CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE AGAIN BY LATE TONIGHT AS A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES THE AREA. WILL PUT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN IN FORECAST 
FOR EXTREME WESTERN ZONES FOR AFTER MIDNIGHT TIME FRAME.

FRONT PUSHES THROUGH ON THURSDAY...IN ADDITION ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA. MODELS STILL DISAGREEING 
WITH POSITION OF THE LOW BUT NONE THE LESS...LOW WILL PROVIDE CLOUDY 
AND RAINY CONDITIONS FOR THE MIDSOUTH. WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY 
POPS. THURSDAY WILL ALSO BE THE COLDEST DAY OF THE SEASON THUS FAR. 

COLD AIR WILL STICK AROUND THURSDAY NIGHT...AS CLOUDS SHOULD 
DECREASE OVERNIGHT ALLOWING FOR TEMPERATURES TO FALL INTO THE LOWER 
TO MID 40S.

ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. NOT A 
LOT OF MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT BUT WILL THINK FRONTAL PASSAGE 
WARRANTS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS.

BY THE WEEKEND...UPPER PATTERN BECOMES MORE SOUTHWESTERLY WHICH WILL 
ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RETURN TO NEAR NORMAL CONDITIONS. HIGH

.UPDATE...
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND PROFILER DATA SHOWS AN UPPER LOW MOVING EAST-
SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN MO. THIS LOW IS EXPECTED TO GRAZE
THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT AS IT CONTINUES EAST-
SOUTHEASTWARD. CLOUDS COVER THE MIDSOUTH BUT LITTLE RAIN IS
PRESENTLY BEING DETECTED BY AREA RADARS. IN AN UPCOMING UPDATE...WILL
HAVE POPS RANGING FROM 30 PERCENT FROM NORTHEAST AR INTO NORTHWEST
TN...AND 20 PERCENT ELSEWHERE FOR THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT. WILL
REMOVE THUNDER FROM THE FORECAST/GRIDS AS A STABLE AIR MASS PRESENTLY
EXISTS OVER THE MIDSOUTH. CAN NOT TOTALLY RULE OUT ELEVATED THUNDER
AS THE LOW NEARS...BUT THE CHANCE SEEMS TOO SLIM TO MENTION IN THE
FORECAST. WESTERLY WINDS OF 10 TO 15 MPH ARE FEEDING COOLER AIR INTO
THE MIDSOUTH. PRESENT FORECAST LOWS LOOK OK...THINK TEMPERATURES WILL
LEVEL OFF WITH THE CLOUDS AND WIND PERSISTING DURING THE NIGHT.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 243 PM CDT TUE OCT 12 2004

MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW SPINNING
OVER SRN MO/NRN AR HAS BEEN WELL EAST AND NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA
TODAY. THE UPPER LOW WILL TRACK SLOWLY EASTWARD TONIGHT BRINGING THE
BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN TO THE NE SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. A
FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE
REGION TONIGHT.

PLENTY OF COOL AIR WILL FILTER IN THE WAKE OF THE UPPER LOW THROUGH
TOMORROW. CLOUDS WILL ALSO BE AROUND...CLEARING FROM WEST TO EAST
THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY. EXPECT ANOTHER COOL FALL DAY WITH MAX
TEMPS APPROACHING 70 DEGREES.

THE FRONT THAT HAS BEEN ADVERTISED THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS WILL BEGIN
TO MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA EARLY THURSDAY. AS
THE FRONT APPROACHES RAIN CHANCES WILL INCREASE FROM WEST TO EAST.
AS THE UPPER TROUGH TRANSLATES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING THE DAY
THURSDAY...STRONG COLD ADVECTION AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LIKELY.
THE RAIN AND ASSOCIATED CLOUD COVER AS WELL AS THE COLD AIR
FILTERING INTO THE REGION WILL KEEP DAYTIME MAX TEMPERATURES IN MID
50S TO NEAR 60. WRAP AROUND PRECIPITATION IN THE FORM OF LIGHT RAIN
WILL PROBABLY OCCUR WITH SUCH A STRONG SYSTEM. EXPECT LINGERING RAIN
THURSDAY NIGHT ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA.

DRY NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL OCCUR THROUGH SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES
WILL REBOUND BEGINNING FRIDAY RETURNING TO THE LOW 70S FOR DAYTIME
HIGHS AND OVERNIGHT LOWS NEAR 50.

A DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM IS POSSIBLE OVER THE DESERT SOUTHWEST
EARLY SUNDAY. THE LATEST MODELS BRING THIS SYSTEM ACROSS THE MID

.DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER SW 
MO...WILL CONTINUE PUSHING EASTWARD TODAY CONTINUING THE CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS WITH A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. HIGHEST POPS WILL OCCUR 
ACROSS NORTHERN ZONES. BY TONIGHT...THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL BE 
CENTERED OVER THE NORTHERN MIDSOUTH. WILL CONTINUE WITH THE SAME 
PRECIPITATION TRENDS AS TODAYS FORECAST.

ON WEDNESDAY...LOW WILL SHIFT EASTWARD BUT SOME ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL STILL LINGER AROUND THE AREA. NORTHEASTERN 
PORTIONS OF THE CWA WILL SEE THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN.

A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
BEHIND THE FRONT WILL BE THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON THUS FAR. 
WOULDN/T BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME FLURRIES AROUND THE CWA THURSDAY 
MORNING AS ANOTHER UPPER LOW MOVES INTO THE MIDSOUTH. ETA IS A 
LITTLE FURTHER NORTH WITH POSITION OF LOW THAN THE GFS. BOTH MODELS 
HOWEVER SHOW 540 THICKNESS LINE NEAR MEMPHIS. WILL WAIT FOR MODEL 
RUNS BEFORE MENTIONING ANY FLURRIES IN FORECAST.

ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH REGION ON FRIDAY NIGHT. BEHIND 
THE FRONT...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA AND THE UPPER 
PATTERN WILL BECOME MORE ZONAL. THIS WILL BRING THE MIDSOUTH 
PLEASANT WEATHER FOR THE WEEKEND.  BY MONDAY...ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR RAIN.

.UPDATE...
LATEST SATELLITE AND UPPER AIR ANALYSES INDICATES AN UPPER LEVEL LOW
SPINNING OVER THE OZARKS. THIS LOW WILL MOVE ONLY SLOWLY EASTWARD IF
ANY TONIGHT. A VORT LOBE EXTENDING SOUTHWARD FROM THIS LOW IS
FORECAST TO ROTATE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. THIS WILL AID IN THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH. 88D KNQA IS PRESENTLY SHOWING WIDESPREAD SHOWERS FROM THE
EASTERN PART OF WEST TN INTO NORTHEAST MS ALONG WITH SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS. THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW JUST SOUTH OF
JONESBORO...REMNANTS OF MATTHEW...WITH A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT FROM
NORTHEAST AR INTO WEST TN. THIS SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE ONLY SLOWLY
NORTHEASTWARD TONIGHT.

CURRENT POPS/WEATHER GRIDS LOOK OK...EXCEPT MAY TWEEK SLIGHTLY.
WILL NEED TO RAISE SOME OVERNIGHT MINIMUM TEMPERATURES...MAINLY
SOUTH OF THE SURFACE FRONT IN THE WARM SECTOR. ALSO...WILL NEED TO
ADJUST THE WINDS TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH THE FRONTAL POSITION...
WITH THE FRONT POSSIBLY LIFTING SLIGHTLY NORTHWARD IN WEST TN. WINDS
ARE GENERALLY NORTHEAST TO THE NORTH OF THE FRONT...SOUTHEAST TO THE
SOUTH OF THE FRONT.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 231 PM CDT MON OCT 11 2004

ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE CONTINUES TO SURGE ACROSS MS AND AL INTO
THE MID SOUTH. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER NORTHEASTERN
OK HAS SPREAD HEAVIER BANDS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO
SOUTHERN MO/IL AND WESTERN KY. STEADY STREAMS OF RAIN HAVE BEEN
MOVING ACROSS PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA ALL MORNING AND INTO THIS
AFTERNOON.

AS THE UPPER LOW OVER OK APPROACHES THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT INCREASING
UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR ADDITIONAL RAINFALL.
CATEGORICAL RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE NORTHERN FORECAST AREA COUPLED
WITH THE UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE WITH LIKELY CHANCES OF RAIN ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE AREA.

BY TUESDAY THE UPPER LOW BEGINS TO KICK OUT AND MOVE ACROSS NE AR
AND W TN THROUGH EARLY WED. RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH THE PASSAGE OF
THE UPPER LOW WILL BE BEST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST
AREA AGAIN...TAPERING OFF TO THE SOUTHERN AREAS.

THE KICKER SYSTEM MOVES SWIFTLY THROUGH THE PLAINS AND INTO THE MID
SOUTH BY THURSDAY MORNING. MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS POTENT
UPPER TROUGH WILL GENERATE RAINFALL OVER THE MID SOUTH. A STRONG
COLD FRONT WILL PROVIDE PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND UPPER
LEVEL INSTABILITY WILL PROVIDE THE LIFT NECESSARY TO PRODUCE SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. INTERESTING TO NOTE
THE STRENGTH OF THIS SYSTEM DEPICTED BY THE 12Z GFS. BY 00Z FRI...
1000-500 MB THICKNESSES ARE 540 DM THIS WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED
WITH FUTURE RUNS...BECAUSE ANY WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH
THE PASSING OF THE UPPER LOW THIS FAR SOUTH COULD PRODUCE LIGHT SNOW
-NO ACCUMULATION- WITH SUCH A COLD COLUMN WANTED TO GO HIGHER WITH
RAIN CHANCES...HOWEVER SURROUNDING OFFICES NOT QUITE AS JAZZED SO
HAVE TAPERED LIKELY POPS TO CHANCE FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

BY FRIDAY THE FORECAST BECOMES DRY THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. ANOTHER
SHOT OF COOLER AIR COMES INTO THE MIX SATURDAY AS AN UPPER LOW
SWINGS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. HOWEVER...THE COOLEST
TEMPERATURES THIS WEEK WILL OCCUR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

THE MID SOUTH WEST THROUGH AR INTO OK. AREAL COVERAGE LESSENS TO THE 
SOUTH ACRS LOUISIANA AND CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN MS. 

TODAY...REMNANTS OF MATTHEW WILL TRACK SLOWLY NORTH INTO SE ARKANSAS 
BY 00Z TUE. MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING DEEP MOISTURE AND 
STRONG LIFT MOVING SLOWLY NORTH THROUGH THE AREA TODAY. BETTER 
CHANCES OF PRECIP ARE EXPECTED FROM MEMPHIS NORTHWARD WITH LESSER 
AREAL COVERAGE ACRS NE MS AS LOWER MEAN RH VALUES WORK NORTHWARD 
FROM THE GULF COAST DURING THE DAY. WL INCLUDE A SMALL CHANCE OF 
THUNDER ACRS THE SW PORTION OF THE CWFA. SOME LIGHTNING DETECTED 
ACRS NW MS THIS MORNING AND MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES SUPPORT ISOLATED 
THUNDER. ETA SHOWING A FEW HUNDRED JOULES OF CAPES ACRS WRN SXNS OF 
THE CWFA AS WELL. COOLER MAV NUMBERS LOOK BEST TODAY CONSIDERING 
RECENT HISTORY. 

TONIGHT...SFC LOW WL MOVE INTO THE MID SOUTH SOMEWHERE NEAR THE MEM 
AREA BY 12Z MON. UPR LOW WL MOVE INTO NW ARKANSAS BY 12Z AS WELL. 
BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT WL BE CONCENTRATED NORTH OF A JBR-MKL LINE

THE SOUTH. WL MOVE SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER A LITTLE EASTWARD IN 
RESPONSE TO UPPER LOW MOVEMENT. TEMPS WL REMAIN FAIRLY MILD 
OVERNIGHT WITH READINGS AROUND 60. NUMERICAL GUIDANCE CLOSE TONIGHT.

TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...SFC LOW MOVES INTO MIDDLE TN AS UPPER 
LOW MOVES TO THE MS RIVER BY 00Z TUE. BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIP WL BE 
ACRS NE SXNS ON TUE...BASICALLY AHEAD AND ALONG UPPER LOW TRACK.  
ALSO MENTIONED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER ACRS NE SXNS AS WELL. BY 
TUE NIGHT THE UPPER LOW WL TRACK INTO MID TN AND PRECIP WL START TO 
SHUT OFF FROM WEST TO EAST. ON WED A VERY WEAK SHORTWAVE RIDGE FILLS 
THE GAP BETWEEN SYSTEMS. MAV NUMBERS SEEMS WAY TOO COOL ON WED 
CONSIDERING 850 MB TEMPS AND SOME POSSIBLY SUNSHINE. WL CONT WITH 
THE WARMER FORECAST ALREADY ONGOING WHICH ADDS 6-10 DEGREES TO

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...MODELS SIMILAR WITH FEATURES ON

RAIN HAS BEEN HARD PRESSED TO OVERCOME DRIER LOW LEVEL AIR ACRS 
NORTHEAST SXNS OF THE FORECAST AREA AND EXPECT THAT SAME TREND TO 
CONTINUE TODAY...THOUGH THE RAIN SHOULD MAKE INROADS. THE SOUTHWEST 
SECTION OF THE MID SOUTH...BASICALLY SOUTH AND WEST OF MEMPHIS WL BE 
MUCH WETTER THAN THE NORTHEAST HALF...SAY NORTH AND EAST OF MKL 
TODAY. WL ADJUST POPS AGAIN BEFORE DEADLINE BUT THINKING CATEGORICAL

NORTH AND EAST OF MKL. TEMPS WL BE HELD DOWN BY RAIN AND CLOUDS AND 
WL CUT A COUPLE CATEGORIES OFF THE GUIDANCE NUMBERS.

TONIGHT...REMNANTS OF MATTHEW MOVE TO EAST CENTRAL MS BY 12Z MON. 
EXPECT RAIN TO OVERSPREAD ALL OF THE MID SOUTH. EXPECT STRONG UPWARD 
MOTION WITH STRONGLY DIFFULENT UPPER PATTERN IN PLACE. THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD WL REPRESENT ABOUT THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN DURING THIS 
WHOLE EVENT. WL GO WITH 90-100 POPS THROUGHOUT. WL GO WITH A BLEND 
OF TEMPS...A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST.

MONDAY THROUGH TUE NIGHT...SFC LOW PROBABLY MOVES INTO NRN MS 
ACCORDING TO GFS WHILE THE ETA DRIFTS IT A LITTLE TO THE WEST. WL 
FOLLOW TPC/HPC AND USE GFS LOW TRACK WHICH SEEMS QUITE REASONABLE. 
EXPECT THE STEADY RAIN BANDS TO MOVE NORTH INTO KY DURING THE 
MORNING. UPR LOW JUST TO THE WEST WITH PLENTY OF LEFT OVER MOISTURE 
SHOULD RESULT IN ADDITIONAL SHOWERS DURING THE AFTERNOON. POPS WL 
RANGE FROM CATEGORICAL ACRS NRN SXNS TO HIGH CHANCE ACRS NRN MS. 
TEMPS WL REMAIN COOL WITH CLOUDS AND PRECIP. UPR LOW TRACKS A LITTLE 
TO THE EAST ON MON NIGHT AND TUE CONTINUING THE SHOWER THREAT. 
CANNOT RULE OUT A RUMBLE OF THUNDER WITH UPR LOW BUT THREAT NOT 
GREAT ENUF ATTM TO ADD TO GRIDS. UPPER LOW OPENS INTO A TROF AND 
MOVES A LITTLE TO THE EAST BY TUE NIGHT RESULTING IN DIMINISHING 
CHCS FOR PRECIP. 

WED...A TRANSITION DAY BETWEEN THE DEPARTING UPPER TROF AND THE  
STRONG INCOMING COLD FRONT. EXPECT A DRY DAY WITH SOME SUN AS MEAN 
RH VALUES DROP BLO 60 PERCENT. TEMPS SHOULD BE IN THE LOW AND 
PERHAPS EVEN MID 70S.

THE UPPER FLOW OVER THE MID SOUTH WILL BE CONTROLLED BY AN UPPER 
LEVEL LOW OVER THE TEXAS PANHANDLE. THIS WILL HELP TRANSPORT 
MOISTURE FROM EAST TEXAS TO THE GULF COAST OF LOUISIANA. REMNANTS OF 
MATTHEW WILL PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN PRECIPITATION LATE TONIGHT AND  
TOMORROW ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI.

ONCE THE PRECIPITATION ASSOCIATED WITH MATTHEW SLOWLY MOVES ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY AND INTO MONDAY...THE UPPER LOW OVER THE 
TEXAS PANHANDLE TRANSLATES INTO OKLAHOMA. AS IT DOES SO...THE MID 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES STEEPEN AND CAPE VALUES INCREASE TO NEAR 1200 J/KG 
OVER THE MID SOUTH. LARGE SCALE ASCENT BY EARLY MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY  SHOULD BRING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE 
REGION. 

A DAY OF DRYING OUT WILL BE IN STORE FOR THE AREA WEDNESDAY AS THE 
UPPER LOW WHICH EVENTUALLY OPENS AND MOVES INTO CENTRAL TN. 
MEANWHILE A STRONG SHORTWAVE TROUGH DIVES OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
AND BEGINS TO DEEPEN THE LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. THIS 
WILL BRING A POTENT COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY 
MORNING. AT THIS TIME THE FRONT AND APPROACHING SHORTWAVE APPEAR TO 
HAVE LIMITED MOISTURE TO PRODUCE RAINFALL HOWEVER...HAVE MENTIONED A 
CHANCE OF RAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY THURSDAY. A DRY SLOT 
COUPLED WITH A JET OF 90+ KNOTS WILL FOLLOW QUICKLY BEHIND THE 
SHORTWAVE SWINGING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. DRY WEATHER WILL FOLLOW 
TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEK WITH ANOTHER REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR

LIGHT RAIN CONTINUES TO MOVE ACROSS NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI AND EASTERN 
ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. THE RAIN IS ASSOCIATED WITH A VORT MAX THAT 
IS ROTATING AROUND AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THAT IS LOCATED OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS. SEVERAL VORT MAXES WILL CONTINUE ROTATING AROUND THE 
BASE OF THE TROUGH TODAY AND TONIGHT KEEPING RAIN CHANCES AROUND THE 
CWA WITH THE SOUTHERN ZONES SEEING THE BEST CHANCES. 
 
BY SUNDAY...TROUGH WILL HAVE MOVED EASTWARD AS TROPICAL STORM 
MATTHEW MOVES INTO THE GULF COAST. MATTHEW WILL SPREAD RAIN NORTHWARD 
INTO THE MIDSOUTH. THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN FROM MATTHEW WILL COME 
IN THE SUNDAY NIGHT TO MONDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME AS THE REMNANTS OF 
MATTHEW WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE CWA. HAVE BUMPED POPS UP TO 
LIKELY/CATEGORICAL DURING THIS TIME. 

BY TUESDAY...RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE AS AN UPPER TROUGH MOVES 
INTO THE CWA. ALTHOUGH CHANCES WILL BE LESS...AROUND 20/30 POPS. 
WILL CONTINUE WITH SPRINKLES INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. 

SHOULD SEE A BREAK IN RAIN CHANCES ON WEDNESDAY BUT THE NEXT COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE MIDSOUTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT BRINGING A SLIGHT 
CHANCE FOR RAIN BACK TO THE AREA. PRECIP MAY LINGER INTO THURSDAY.  
MUCH COOLER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT. HIGHS MAY 
NOT GET OUT OF THE 60S IF CLOUDS HANG IN THE AREA FOR MOST OF THE

AN UPPER LEVEL AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO CUTOFF OVER THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES THIS WEEKEND AS A TROPICAL LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM NOW OVER THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO MOVES NORTH INTO
THE GULF COAST STATES. MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO SURGE NORTHWARD
AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW AND IN ADVANCE OF THE TROPICAL LOW AND THIS
SHOULD HELP TO MOISTEN UP THE STILL DRY LOW LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL RANGE BETWEEN 1.5 AND 2.0 INCHES OVER
MOST OF THE AREA LATER TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. IN ADDITION...A SERIES
OF VORTICITY CENTERS WILL ROTATE AROUND THE UPPER LEVEL LOW TO OUR
WEST...BRINGING PERIODS OF WET WEATHER TO THE MIDSOUTH BEGINNING THIS
EVENING OVER WESTERN SECTIONS AND CONTINUING OVER MOST OF THE AREA
THROUGH SUNDAY. SO PLAN TO KEEP LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS GOING
ACROSS MANY AREAS THROUGH SUNDAY...AS THE TROPICAL LOW MOVES SLOWLY
NORTH AND THEN NORTHEAST THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK.
TEMPERATURES THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK WILL BE HELD DOWN AS A RESULT OF
THE ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER AND HIGH RAIN CHANCES.

PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL DECREASE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ON MONDAY
AS THE REGION GETS INTO THE DRY SLOT. BY LATER SUNDAY...PORTIONS OF
THE AREA SHOULD GET INTO THE WARM SECTOR OF THIS SYSTEM AS THE
SURFACE LOW MOVES TO OUR WEST. HAVE INTRODUCED THUNDER BACK INTO
THE FORECAST ACROSS THE AREA FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY AS
INSTABILITY DOES INCREASE DURING THIS PERIOD. ALTHOUGH INSTABILITY
INCREASES SOMEWHAT...STILL ENOUGH CLOUDS AROUND TO KEEP INSTABILITY
IN CHECK...SO NOT EXPECTING SEVERE WEATHER AT THIS TIME.

THIS TROPICAL LOW WILL BEGIN TO PULL EAST OF THE CWA BY TUESDAY
NIGHT...WITH NORTHWEST WINDS FUNNELING DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION
BEHIND THE DEPARTING LOW. A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS
THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH A SHOT OF COOLER AND EVEN DRIER AIR
FOR THE MIDDLE TO END OF NEXT WEEK. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD BE
LIMITED BEHIND THE DEPARTING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ON TUESDAY NIGHT...
SO EXPECTING THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL HAVE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF
MOISTURE TO WORK WITH BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SO EXPECTING DRY WEATHER
AND COOL TEMPERATURES FOR THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING TIME

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS CONTINUES TO SLOWLY PUSH EAST FROM THE
PLAINS STATES THIS MORNING. A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES WILL CONTINUE
TO ROTATE THROUGH THE TROUGH BRINGING INCREASED CHANCES FOR RAIN
MAINLY ACROSS FAR WESTERN PORTIONS OF OUR CWA THIS AFTERNOON.

CURRENT EASTERN EDGE OF RAIN SHIELD WHICH IS NOW VERY SLOWLY
APPROACHING EASTERN ARKANSAS HAS HAD A TOUGH TIME PROGRESSING FURTHER
EAST. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES CONTINUES TO ADVECT LOW
LEVEL DRY AIR...AS NOTED FROM 12Z BMX/OHX MORNING SOUNDINGS...INTO
OUR AREA FROM THE SOUTHEAST. THIS SHOULD KEEP RAIN CHANCES LOW THIS
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE AREA. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL
GRADUALLY BEGIN TO MOISTEN UP LATER THIS EVENING SO EXPECT RAIN
CHANCES TO INCREASE LATER THIS EVENING. MAY NEED TO TWEAK CURRENT
POPS TO REFLECT ONGOING SITUATION...ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST...BUT ANY
CHANGES SHOULD BE MINOR. ACROSS EASTERN SECTIONS...CURRENT POP
FORECAST LOOKS GOOD.

CLOUD COVER CONTINUES TO LOWER AND THICKEN ACROSS THE ENTIRE
MIDSOUTH. THIS MAY HAMPER FORECAST HIGH TEMPERATURES A BIT...
ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN ZONES. MAY NEED TO LOWER TEMPS A FEW
DEGREES OVER THESE AREAS...BUT WILL WAIT UNTIL AFTER ALL OF THE 16Z
OBS COME IN BEFORE MAKING FINAL DECISION.

REMAINDER OF THE CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. ANY CHANGES TO THE
FORECAST WILL BE MADE BEFORE 17Z.

QUIET WEATHER WILL BE COMING TO AN END BY THIS WEEKEND ACROSS THE 
MIDSOUTH. CURRENT RADAR SHOWS AN AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN 
MOVING NORTHWARD ACROSS LOUISIANA AND ARKANSAS. RAIN IS ASSOCIATED 
WITH A LARGE UPPER TROUGH MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. SEVERAL 
SHORTWAVES WILL ROTATE AROUND THE BASE OF THE TROUGH OVER THE NEXT 
24 HOURS GIVING THE MIDSOUTH CHANCES FOR MUCH NEEDED RAIN. 

THE FIRST SHORTWAVE WILL BEGIN TO PUSH INTO WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE 
MIDSOUTH TODAY. HAVE BUMPED UP POPS SLIGHTLY...STILL WILL CONTINUE 
WITH A CHANCE FOR RAIN IN WESTERN PART OF CWA WITH KEEPING EASTERN 
PART DRY. BY TONIGHT...A STRONGER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA 
AND WILL BRING BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN.

BY THE WEEKEND THE FOCUS OF RAIN CHANCES WILL SHIFT TO A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE GULF COAST. LOW WILL GRADUALLY PUSH 
NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE GULF COAST INTO THE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL 
CONTINUE RAIN CHANCES THROUGH AT LEAST MONDAY. TIMING IS STILL A BIG 
QUESTION. GFS IS MUCH SLOWER AND KEEPS RAIN AROUND THROUGH TUESDAY. 
WILL LEAVE FORECAST AS IS ENDING PRECIP CHANCES ON MONDAY.

FEATURES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE FORECAST INCLUDE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. THERE IS A RIDGE AXIS OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH THAT IS SLOWLY MOVING EASTWARD. AN UPPER TROUGH EXTENDS 
FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO NEW MEXICO. EMBEDDED IN THIS TROUGH ARE 
A PAIR OF VORTICES...ONE OVER NEBRASKA AND THE OTHER OVER NEW 
MEXICO. FINALLY A DISTURBANCE IN THE WESTERN GULF. 

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND UPPER AIR ANALYSIS SHOWS AN JET MOVING 
THROUGH TEXAS...UP THE WESTERN SLOPE OF THE RIDGE. WITH THE RIDGE 
AXIS SLIPPING EASTWARD THAT THE JET WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION. THIS 
SHOULD BRING INCREASING CLOUDS INTO THE AREA TODAY ALTHOUGH DO NOT 
EXPECT RAINFALL WITH LOW LEVELS STILL RATHER DRY DUE TO THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM PUMPING DRY AIR INTO THE 
REGION ON EASTERLY OR SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS. 

CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFERING MODELS SOLUTIONS BETWEEN THE ETA AND GFS 
WITH THE FORECAST GOING INTO THE WEEKEND. ALTHOUGH BOTH MODELS STALL 
OUT THE THROUGH...THE ETA IS FURTHER EAST AND MORE OVER THE REGION. 
THE GFS STALLS THE DISTURBANCE CURRENTLY OVER THE GULF ALONG THE 
GULF COAST WHEREAS THE ETA BRINGS IT INLAND. AFTER BURNING MANY 
BRAIN CELLS...HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS LIKELY THAT 
NEITHER RUN HANDLES THE DETAILS THIS WEEKEND EXACTLY RIGHT. LETS 
START WITH THE ETA. THE ETA APPEARS TO BREAK DOWN THE WESTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH TOO FAST. THE ETA SUGGESTS THAT THE NORTHERN 
VORT WILL ERODE A GOOD DEAL OF THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH. 
THE MORE LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT THE NORTHERN VORT WILL SLIDE UP AND 
OVER THE RIDGE LEAVING THE SOUTHERN VORT SOMEWHERE OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS WITH AT LEAST A PART OF THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE IN 
TACT. THIS IS WHY THE ETA BRINGS THE DISTURBANCE IN THE GULF UP THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY UNRESTRICTED. THE GFS LIKELY HANDLES THE 
SPLITTING OF THE TWO VORTS WELL. HOWEVER...IT STRENGTHENS THE 
WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH AND CLEAR ACROSS 
ARKANSAS WHILE STILL BRINGING MOISTURE UP THROUGH ARKANSAS. THIS IS 
WHY THE GFS STALLS THE DISTURBANCE OFF THE COAST. BEST GUESS...BLEND 
THE TWO SOLUTIONS. THIS RESULTS IN A SOLUTION THAT IS SIMILAR TO THE 
ETA IN THAT THE DISTURBANCE MOVES INLAND...ALTHOUGH THE TIMING IS 
SLOWED DOWN. THIS RESULTS IN A DRY FORECAST FOR THE MOST OF THE 
REGION INTO AT LEAST SATURDAY. ALTHOUGH CANT TOTALLY RULE OUT THAT 
SOME RAIN MAY SKIRT PORTIONS OF EAST ARKANSAS SINCE IT IS IMPOSSIBLE 
TO KNOW JUST HOW MUCH OF THE WESTERN HIGH WILL DETERIORATE. THINK 
THAT THE DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE INLAND SOMETIME OVER THE WEEKEND AND 
THAT RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD THE REGION FROM THE SOUTHWEST. EXACT 
TIMING FOR THIS SCENARIO IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN. GIVEN THE HIGH DEGREE

.DISCUSSION...

FEATURES OF IMPORTANCE TO THE FORECAST INCLUDE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. THERE IS A RIDGE AXIS OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH THAT IS SLOWLY MOVING EASTWARD. AN UPPER TROUGH EXTENDS 
FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO NEW MEXICO. EMBEDDED IN THIS TROUGH ARE 
A PAIR OF VORTICES...ONE OVER NEBRASKA AND THE OTHER OVER NEW 
MEXICO. FINALLY A DISTURBANCE IN THE WESTERN GULF. 

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND UPPER AIR ANALYSIS SHOWS AN JET MOVING 
THROUGH TEXAS...UP THE WESTERN SLOPE OF THE RIDGE. WITH THE RIDGE 
AXIS SLIPPING EASTWARD THAT THE JET WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION. THIS 
SHOULD BRING INCREASING CLOUDS INTO THE AREA TODAY ALTHOUGH DO NOT 
EXPECT RAINFALL WITH LOW LEVELS STILL RATHER DRY DUE TO THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM PUMPING DRY AIR INTO THE 
REGION ON EASTERLY OR SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS. 

CONTINUE TO HAVE DIFFERING MODELS SOLUTIONS BETWEEN THE ETA AND GFS 
WITH THE FORECAST GOING INTO THE WEEKEND. ALTHOUGH BOTH MODELS STALL 
OUT THE THROUGH...THE ETA IS FURTHER EAST AND MORE OVER THE REGION. 
THE GFS STALLS THE DISTURBANCE CURRENTLY OVER THE GULF ALONG THE 
GULF COAST WHEREAS THE ETA BRINGS IT INLAND. AFTER BURNING MANY 
BRAIN CELLS...HAVE COME TO THE CONCLUSION THAT IT IS LIKELY THAT 
NEITHER RUN HANDLES THE DETAILS THIS WEEKEND EXACTLY RIGHT. LETS 
START WITH THE ETA. THE ETA APPEARS TO BREAK DOWN THE WESTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE DOWN TOO FAST. THE ETA SUGGESTS THAT THE NORTHERN 
VORT WILL ERODE A GOOD DEAL OF THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH. 
THE MORE LIKELY SCENARIO IS THAT THE NORTHERN VORT WILL SLIDE UP AND 
OVER THE RIDGE LEAVING THE SOUTHERN VORT SOMEWHERE OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS WITH AT LEAST A PART OF THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE IN 
TACT. THIS IS WHY THE ETA BRINGS THE DISTURBANCE IN THE GULF UP THE

.UPDATE...
HIGH PRESSURE MOVING EAST ACROSS THE OH VALLEY TONIGHT. SCT HIGH 
CLOUDS BEGINNING TO SLOWLY MOVE INTO THE MID SOUTH FROM THE SW.  
TEMPS MAINLY IN THE 60S THIS EVENING. SFC DEWPOINTS IN THE 40S/50S 
COMBINED WITH LIGHT ENE WINDS AND NOT TOO MUCH CLOUD COVER SHOULD 
HELP TEMPS REACH FORECAST LOWS. ONGOING FORECAST LOOKS GOOD WITH NO 
CHANGES ATTM.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 241 PM...
SURFACE HIGH TO OUR EAST PROVIDING ANOTHER NICE SUNNY OCTOBER
DAY TO THE MIDSOUTH. AFTERNOON HIGHS RUNNING ABOUT 5 DEGREES
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...WITH ONLY A FEW CIRRUS CLOUDS PREVENTING
A NEAR PERFECT DAY.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH FRIDAY)...
OVERNIGHT HOURS TONIGHT SHOULD STILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR. DEWPOINTS
RUNNING 5-10 DEGREES HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME. WOULD
EXPECT OVERNIGHT LOWS TONIGHT TO BE WARMER THAN THIS MORNING...
QUESTION IS HOW MUCH. GUIDANCE LOWS ARE 10-15 DEGREES WARMER THAN
THIS MORNINGS LOWS. WITH CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS FOR MUCH OF
THE NIGHT...UNDERCUTTING GUIDANCE APPEARS TO BE THE WAY TO GO.
EXCEPTION WOULD BE MEMPHIS INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT...URBAN HEAT
ISLAND EFFECT.

AS UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE SOUTHWEST TOMORROW...MID AND HIGH
LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASE...HENCE ADDITIONAL CLOUDINESS. WARMING OF
BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE OFFSET BY THESE CLOUDS...SO HIGHS TOMORROW
NOT FAR OFF THOSE TODAY. THIS WILL ALSO ALLOW MINS TO BE SEVERAL
DEGREES WARMER THURSDAY NIGHT.

AFTER THURSDAY NIGHT...SIGNIFICANT DIVERGENCE OF MODEL SOLUTIONS
FOR OUR CWA. ETA MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH UPPER TROF AND
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. THIS APPEARS TO BE OVERDONE...AND WILL KEEP
PRECIPITATION WEST OF OUR CWA ON FRIDAY. EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW AT
LOWER LEVELS SHOULD KEEP ENOUGH DRY AIR OVER US TO PREVENT
MEASURABLE RAIN...ALTHOUGH WOULDNT BE SHOCKED TO GET A SPRINKLE
OUT OF A MID-LEVEL CLOUD LAYER. THICKER CLOUDS AND BOUNDARY LAYER
COOLING FRIDAY MEAN HIGHS AT LEAST 5-7 DEGREES COOLER THAN THURSDAY.
&&

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT AND BEYOND)...
FORECASTER CONFIDENCE IN SPECIFICS OF MODEL SOLUTIONS DURING THE
WEEKEND IS LOW. JUST AS AN EXAMPLE FROM THE 12Z RUN...ETA MODEL RUN
PRECIP ENDING AT 18Z SATURDAY HAS 5-7 INCHES OF RAIN OVER WRN
ARKANSAS AND LOUISIANA (ORIENTED N-S)...GFS LESS THAN AN INCH. GFS
MAX CENTERED ALONG GULF COAST (ORIENTED E-W). ETA APPEARS WAY
OVERDONE ON SPEED AND STRENGTH OF TROF APPROACHING THE AREA...
ESPECIALLY TRYING TO MOVE INTO THE MEAN RIDGE POSITION. GFS SPEED
APPEARS A LITTLE MORE REASONABLE...AND WITH VORT MOVING NORTHEAST
FROM MEXICO...A FOCUS OF PRECIP NEAR GULF COAST ALONG MOISTURE
BOUNDARY/WARM FRONT...APPEARS TO BE MUCH MORE REASONABLE. MOISTURE AT
HIGH AND MID LEVELS NEVER REALLY PHASES WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
ACROSS THE CWA FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT PERIOD OF TIME. WILL HAVE LOW POPS
IN FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...MAINLY 20 PERCENT. AFTER THAT...WILL KEEP
CHANCE POPS IN FOR SATURDAY INTO MONDAY. HOPEFULLY...IN THE NEXT RUN
OR TWO...MODELS WILL CONVERGE SOMEWHAT TOWARD A MORE CONSISTENT
SOLUTION. BEST WINDOW FOR MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION WOULD BE SUNDAY

WE HAVE BEEN IN A DRY SPELL ACROSS MUCH OF THE CWA...LAST 0.25 INCH
RAINFALL IN ONE DAY AT MEMPHIS AIRPORT WAS AUGUST 28...ALMOST 6 WEEKS
AGO. ONLY AREA THAT WOULD BE AN EXCEPTION WOULD BE TUPELO AREA WHICH
WAS GRAZED BY HURRICANE IVAN. EVEN THERE...NO SIGNIFICANT

PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE OUT OF THE WAY BY TUESDAY MORNING...WITH
THE REMAINDER OF TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BEING DRY. GFS HINTS AT A

.DISCUSSION...

MAIN FEATURES THAT WILL IMPACT THE FORECAST BEGIN AN UPPER LOW OVER 
THE WESTERN US. IN RESPONSE TO THIS LOW...A RIDGE IS BUILDING OVER  
THE MIDSOUTH. ALSO THERE IS A TROPICAL DISTURBANCE IN THE WESTERN 
GULF NEAR VERACRUZ MEXICO. 

THERE ARENT TOO MANY PROBLEMS IN THE SHORT TERM FORECAST. THE UPPER 
RIDGE SHOULD KEEP CONDITIONS DRY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THERE 
IS SOME CONVECTION OVER WEST TEXAS THIS MORNING. EXPECT THAT THE 
REGION MAY SEE THE CIRRUS FROM THIS CONVECTION...BUT HARD PRESSED TO 
FIND MUCH ELSE IN THE WAY OF MOISTURE. SO WENT WITH A MOSTLY SUNNY 
FORECAST FOR TODAY. LOOKING AT YESTERDAY/S HIGH TEMPS...THE STRENGTH 
OF THE COLD POOL WAS OVERDONE BY THE GUIDANCE. GFS/ETA SUGGEST THAT 
TEMPS WILL BE A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER TODAY WITH THE SURFACE HIGH 
SHIFTING EASTWARD SOMEWHAT AND THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE 
AREA. 00Z GUIDANCE APPEARS TO HAVE ACCOUNTED FOR THIS AND APPEARS 
REASONABLE. 

ON THURSDAY UPPER RIDGE AXIS SLIDES EASTWARD MORE TOWARDS MIDDLE TN 
WITH THE UPPER LOW MOVING INTO THE WESTERN PLAINS. SOUTHERLY FLOW 
RETURNS TO THE REGION. ETA TRIES TO DEVELOP SOME QPF OVER THE REGION 
AS IT PHASES SOME ENERGY COMING OFF THE UPPER LOW WITH A WEAK JET 
THAT WILL BE MOVING NORTHWARD DURING THE DAY. THINK THAT THE ETA 
DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE STRENGTH/POSITION OF THE RIDGE OVER THE 
REGION AS WELL AS THE GFS. WITH THAT SAID...THE BETTER RAIN CHANCES 
THIS WEEK SHOULD BE JUST WEST OF THE REGION AS THE GFS BRINGS THE 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEAKENING UPPER LOW INTO WESTERN 
ARKANSAS THROUGH MISSOURI AND INTO ILLINOIS. IN ADDITION...THE GFS 
SHOWS DRY EASTERLY WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIDGE BLOWING THROUGH 
THE REGION. 

ON SATURDAY THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SHOULD BE INTO EAST TX WITH 
MOISTURE STREAMING NORTHWARD UP THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. ATMOSPHERE 
LOOKS RATHER STABLE...SO EXPECTING MAINLY RAIN AND NOT MUCH THUNDER. 
GFS BRINGS A GOOD VORT MAX ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST CHANCES FOR 
RAIN. WILL LINGER CHANCES INTO MONDAY FOR TIMING PURPOSES. LOWERED 
TEMPS ON SUNDAY INTO THE LOWER 70S DUE TO RAIN.

ON THURSDAY UPPER RIDGE AXIS SLIDES EASTWARD MORE TOWARDS MIDDLE TN 
WITH THE UPPER LOW MOVING INTO THE WESTERN PLAINS. SOUTHERLY FLOW 
RETURNS TO THE REGION. ETA TRIES TO DEVELOP SOME QPF OVER THE REGION 
AS IT PHASES SOME ENERGY COMING OFF THE UPPER LOW WITH A WEAK JET 
THAT WILL BE MOVING NORTHWARD DURING THE DAY. THINK THAT THE ETA 
DOES NOT ACCOUNT FOR THE STRENGTH/POSITION OF THE RIDGE OVER THE 
REGION AS WELL AS THE GFS. WITH THAT SAID...THE BETTER RAIN CHANCES 
THIS WEEK SHOULD BE JUST WEST OF THE REGION AS THE GFS BRINGS THE 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEAKENING UPPER LOW INTO WESTERN 
ARKANSAS THROUGH MISSOURI AND INTO ILLINOIS. IN ADDITION...THE GFS 
SHOWS DRY EASTERLY WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE RIDGE BLOWING THROUGH 
THE REGION. 

ON SATURDAY THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SHOULD BE INTO EAST TX WITH 
MOISTURE STREAMING NORTHWARD UP THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. ATMOSPHERE 
LOOKS RATHER STABLE...SO EXPECTING MAINLY RAIN AND NOT MUCH THUNDER. 
GFS BRINGS A GOOD VORT MAX ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. THINK THAT WILL BE THE BEST CHANCES FOR 
RAIN. WILL LINGER CHANCES INTO MONDAY FOR TIMING PURPOSES. LOWERED 
TEMPS ON SUNDAY INTO THE LOWER 70S DUE TO RAIN.

A MID LEVEL VORT IS MOVING ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THIS 
MORNING. THIS HAS PRODUCED A GOOD DEAL OF HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS 
MAINLY SOUTH OF TN. THE SURFACE FRONT HAS BECOME STATIONARY ACROSS 
NORTHERN LA AND SOUTHERN MS/AL. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS POSITIONED 
OVER NORTHERN IL. THERE IS ENOUGH OF A PRESSURE GRADIENT IN BETWEEN 
THE TWO SYSTEMS THAT WINDS HAVE REMAINED UP OVERNIGHT. THE GRADIENT 
SHOULD GRADUALLY WEAKEN TODAY AS THE HIGH SHIFTS EASTWARD. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY SHOWED A WIDESPREAD MID LEVEL OVERCAST DECK ACROSS MUCH OF 
ARKANSAS INTO NORTH MS PRIOR TO 07Z. HOWEVER...SATELLITE TRENDS 
AFTER 07Z SHOW THAT DECK BREAKING UP SO HAVE GONE WITH A PARTLY 
SUNNY FORECAST EVERYWHERE TODAY. ALSO RAISED HIGHS TODAY ONE 
CATEGORY AND CLOSER TO GUIDANCE. MAV TRENDS HAVE BEEN VERY 
CONSISTENT ON HIGHS OVER THE LAST FEW RUNS. 

NOT TOO MANY MORE CHANGES TO PREVIOUS FORECAST THROUGH THE REST OF 
THE WEEK. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH IN RESPONSE TO THE CYCLONE OVER THE WESTERN US. THIS SHOULD 
KEEP THE REGION DRY TILL FRIDAY. DID RAISE MIN TEMPS AT MEM TO BE 
BETTER LINED WITH MAV VALUES WHICH USUALLY HANDLE MIN TEMPS AT 
MEMPHIS FAIRLY WELL AND SEE NO OBVIOUS REASON TO DIFFER GREATLY FROM 
MEM GUIDANCE. 

RIDGE BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN OVER THE WEEKEND WITH CYCLONE INCHING 
TOWARDS THE REGION. SUSPECT THAT A GOOD PORTION OF THE REGION WILL 
SEE SOME RAIN AT SOME POINT OVER THE WEEKEND...ALTHOUGH THERE IS 
MUCH UNCERTAINTY AS TO EXACTLY WHEN. ALSO EXTENDED POPS INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...FEEL THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL LINGER AROUND SINCE THIS 
SYSTEM DEALS MORE WITH A PATTERN CHANGE ON THE LARGE SCALE AS 
OPPOSED TO A QUICK HITTING SHORTWAVE FOR EXAMPLE.

A COLD FRONT STRETCHED FROM SOUTHERN KENTUCKY WESTWARD ACROSS
SOUTHERN MISSOURI INTO OKLAHOMA LATE THIS MORNING WILL CONTINUE TO
MOVE SOUTH TODAY IN ADVANCE OF A STRONG UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE
TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. AN MCS THAT DEVELOPED
LAST NIGHT OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES CONTINUES TO DROP
SOUTHEAST ACROSS PORTIONS OF EAST TEXAS LATE THIS MORNING AND WILL
MOVE INTO LOUISIANA THIS AFTERNOON WITH A CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS.
NOT EXPECTING ANY RAIN OVER OUR AREA AS LOW LEVEL ATMOSPHERE REMAINS
DRY...PER 12Z REGIONAL SOUNDINGS...AND SYSTEM WILL REMAIN TO OUR
SOUTH. HIGH CLOUDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO
STREAM ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY
ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD REMAIN THIN ENOUGH SO THAT
THE CURRENT FORECAST OF PARTLY CLOUDY OVER SOUTHERN HALF SHOULD BE
FINE. NORTHERN HALF WILL HAVE LESS IN THE WAY OF CLOUD COVER THIS
AFTERNOON...BUT WILL LEAVE PARTLY CLOUDY WORDING TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY
CLOUDS THAT DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON NORTHERN AREAS AS
THE FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL OCCUR AROUND MIDDAY THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON.
THIS MAY KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM REACHING FORECAST HIGHS IN THE LOW
80S AND MAY NEED TO LOWER TEMPS IN THESE AREAS LATER THIS MORNING.
WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SPEED OF THIS FRONTAL FEATURE FOR
POSSIBLE UPDATE. CLOUDS OVER SOUTHERN AREAS SHOULD REMAIN THIN ENOUGH
NOT TO AFFECT FORECAST TEMPERATURES OVER THESE AREAS...BUT WILL WATCH
THIS TREND AS WELL. REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK.

A COLD FRONT STRETCHED FROM SOUTHERN KENTUCKY WESTWARD ACROSS
SOUTHERN MISSOURI INTO OKLAHOMA LATE THIS MORNING WILL CONTINUE TO
MOVE SOUTH TODAY IN ADVANCE OF A STRONG UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE
TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. AN MCS THAT DEVELOPED
LAST NIGHT OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES CONTINUES TO DROP
SOUTHEAST ACROSS PORTIONS OF EAST TEXAS LATE THIS MORNING AND WILL
MOVE INTO LOUISIANA THIS AFTERNOON WITH A CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS.
NOT EXPECTING ANY RAIN OVER OUR AREA AS LOW LEVEL ATMOSPHERE REMAINS
DRY...PER 12Z REGIONAL SOUNDINGS...AND SYSTEM WILL REMAIN TO OUR
SOUTH. HIGH CLOUDS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO
STREAM ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE MIDSOUTH THIS AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY
ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD REMAIN THIN ENOUGH SO THAT
THE CURRENT FORECAST OF PARTLY CLOUDY OVER SOUTHERN HALF SHOULD BE
FINE. NORTHERN HALF WILL HAVE LESS IN THE WAY OF CLOUD COVER THIS
AFTERNOON...BUT WILL LEAVE PARTLY CLOUDY WORDING TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY
CLOUDS THAT DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON NORTHERN AREAS AS
THE FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL OCCUR AROUND MIDDAY THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON.
THIS MAY KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM REACHING FORECAST HIGHS IN THE LOW
80S AND MAY NEED TO LOWER TEMPS IN THESE AREAS LATER THIS MORNING.
WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE SPEED OF THIS FRONTAL FEATURE FOR
POSSIBLE UPDATE. CLOUDS OVER SOUTHERN AREAS SHOULD REMAIN THIN ENOUGH
NOT TO AFFECT FORECAST TEMPERATURES OVER THESE AREAS...BUT WILL WATCH
THIS TREND AS WELL. REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK.

A POTENT SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL SWING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES THIS 
MORNING WHICH WILL CAUSE A COLD FRONT TO MOVE INTO THE MID SOUTH 
THIS AFTERNOON. EARLY THIS MORNING THE COLD FRONT EXTENDED FROM 
CHICAGO TO KANSAS CITY TO DODGE CITY. THE STORMS THAT HAVE FORMED 
ALONG THIS BOUNDARY WERE LOCATED IN CENTRAL KANSAS. OTHER 
THUNDERSTORMS WERE LOCATED ALONG THE RED RIVER VALLEY IN NORTHERN 
TEXAS AND SOUTHERN OKLAHOMA. MAINLY HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL STREAM 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TODAY AS SOME TROPICAL GULF MOISTURE GETS 
CAUGHT UP IN THE MEAN WESTERLY FLOW. 

THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO NORTHERN AREAS OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 
NOON. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON AS WINDS SWITCH TO THE NORTH IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT. 
TEMPERATURES AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL GET A CHANCE TO WARM UP WITH 
GOOD INSOLATION...MAKING IT INTO THE LOWER AND MID 80S. ANY RAINFALL 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND EAST TEXAS. THE MID SOUTH IS CURRENTLY IN AN 
UNFAVORED AREA FOR RAIN FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS DUE TO A LACK OF LOW  
LEVEL MOISTURE AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT.

OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE SIMILAR TO THE PAST FEW NIGHTS AS OF LATE. 
EXPECTING TUESDAY TO BE THE COOLEST DAY THIS WEEK.

WE WILL FOCUS OUR ATTENTION TO THE DEVELOPING TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED 
MOISTURE OVER THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS...ESPECIALLY THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY. LATEST MODELS HAVE SLOWED THE APPROACHING SYSTEM BY 
ABOUT A DAY. ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL OCCUR WITH RISING DEW POINTS 
COMMENCING THURSDAY AND CHANCES FOR RAIN INCREASING TOO. THE CURRENT 
FORECAST HANDLES THIS WELL AT THIS TIME.

NORTHEAST. THIS RAIN SHOULD NOT REACH THE FORECAST AREA SO NO NEED TO
ADD POPS TO FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON. COLD FRONT NOW RUNNING
THROUGH EASTERN NEBRASKA...CENTRAL KANSAS INTO THE TEXAS PANHANDLE
AND SHOULD REACH OUR REGION BY LATER TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES APPEAR TO
BE ON TRACK SO NO CHANGES TO CURRENT FORECAST ARE PLANNED AT THIS
TIME.

STRONG SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS CENTRAL OKLAHOMA THIS MORNING AS SEEN 
ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. THIS FEATURE WILL BE FUELED BY A 90 KNOT 
JET. EXPECT MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TO STREAK ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY BUT SHOULD NOT HINDER DAYTIME MAX TEMPS. A WEAK WARM 
ADVECTION PATTERN PERSISTS TODAY AND TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT 
ASSOCIATED WITH A VERY DEEP TROUGH SWINGING INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION. THE TIMING OF THIS FRONT WILL BE THE KEY TO TONIGHT/S 
TEMPERATURES. IT APPEARS THAT THE FRONT WILL BEGIN TO ENTER THE 
NORTHWEST FORECAST AREA BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND 3 AM. THE BEST CHANCES 
FOR RAIN WILL BE OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS TONIGHT...AND SPREADING 
INTO WEST TENNESSEE AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH THE BEST UPPER LEVEL 
DYNAMICS OCCURRING OVER THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
THE FRONT WILL MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA BY MID 
DAY SATURDAY. THE FRONT WILL ALSO SCOUR OUT MOISTURE...THUS A DRY 
FORECAST WILL RETURN BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON FOR THE WHOLE AREA. THE 
COLDEST OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL TAKE PLACE ON SUNDAY MORNING 
WITH CLEAR SKIES AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE MID SOUTH. 
ANOTHER SECONDARY SURGE OF COOL AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION MONDAY 
HOWEVER THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE APPEARS DRY.

SUNNY SKIES CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND
TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED UP INTO THE 70S. COLD FRONT OVER THE
NORTHERN PLAINS THIS AFTERNOON WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK SOUTH TONIGHT
AND FRIDAY. THE FRONT SHOULD BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE REGION BY FRIDAY
NIGHT THAT WE WILL SEE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE
RAIN SHOULD REMAIN MAINLY WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI BEFORE MIDNIGHT
FRIDAY NIGHT AND THEN SPREAD EASTWARD EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. HAVE
KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA FOR SATURDAY.
THE 12Z MODEL RUN HAS SLOWED DOWN THE FRONT SOMEWHAT SO THERE STILL
MAY BE SOME RAIN IN THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE FORECAST AREA AFTER
00Z SATURDAY NIGHT SO HAVE LEFT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THERE FOR SATURDAY
EVENING.

ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT. WITH
LIMITED MOISTURE TO WORK WITH...NO RAIN IS EXPECTED. HOWEVER...
COOLER AIR WILL FILTER IN BEHIND THIS SECOND FRONT WHICH WILL KEEP
TEMPERATURES SOME 5 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR THE MIDDLE PART

A FEW HIGH CLOUDS ACRS THE REGION OTRW PLENTY OF SUN AND TEMPS IN 
THE LOWER 80S. A REINFORCING COLD FRONT WL MOVE THROUGH OVERNIGHT 
WITH PERHAPS SOME MORE CLOUDINESS BUT NO PRECIP. ANOTHER SURFACE 
HIGH WL BUILD IN BEHIND THE FRONT RESULTING IN MORE DRY AND PLEASANT 
WEATHER FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK. HIGH TEMPS SHOULD BE ABOUT 5 
DEGREES COOLER ON WED WITH THE NEW AIRMASS. HIGH PRESSURE WL 
SLOWLY SLIP EAST ACRS THE OH VALLEY AND INTO THE MID ATLANTIC FROM 
THU TO FRI. EXPECT THU AND FRI MORNINGS TO BE RELATIVELY COOL WITH 
SOME READINGS IN THE 40S POSSIBLE IN THE COOLER SECTIONS. HIGH TEMPS 
WL SLOWLY MODERATE EACH DAY. EXPECT A RETURN TO SOUTHERLY SFC FLOW 
ON FRI AND TEMPS REACHING WELL INTO THE 80S. 

MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS RUNS IN MOVING 
A STRONG COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION LATER FRI NIGHT AND EARLY 
SAT. MOISTURE RETURN WITH THIS FRONT WL BE WEAK AND BEST LIFT WL BE 
WELL TO THE NORTH WITH THE MAIN SHORTWAVE. AS A RESULT WL KEEP POPS 
RELATIVELY LOW FRI NIGHT INTO SAT. COOL CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE WL

DURING THE EARLY EVENING. WL TAKE A COUPLE DEGREES OFF TEMPS AND GO 
WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 352 AM...

PRESSURE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. INFRARED/WATER VAPOR SATELLITE 
IMAGERY SHOWING SHORTWAVE ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST SLIDING SOUTH AND 
UPPER LEVEL LOW NEAR THE TEXAS PANHANDLE GRADUALLY MOVING EAST. 
OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE REGION RANGED FROM THE 50S TO 
LOWER 60S.

TODAY...SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BRING ANOTHER DAY OF 
TRANQUIL WEATHER TO THE MID SOUTH. SUNNY/MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES CAN BE 
EXPECTED WITH 1000-500MB RH/S AGAIN AVERAGING AROUND 30-40 PERCENT. 
850MB WINDS AROUND 15KTS MIX 13-14C AIR DOWN TO THE 
SURFACE...PRODUCING HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S.   

.LONG TERM...WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY RESULTING SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY...THEN FOLLOWED BY A STRONGER COLD FRONT ON SATURDAY.

TONIGHT...WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY ACROSS THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI WILL 
SLIDE SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY

MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND MERGES WITH THE UPPER LEVEL WAVE. ALTHOUGH

BE PRESENT...A LACK OF MOISTURE WITH THE ATMOSPHERE ALREADY DRY WILL 
PREVENT ANY PRECIPITATION FROM OCCURRING. AS A RESULT...I/LL KEEP 
THE CURRENT DRY FORECAST GOING IN THE GRIDS. 

WEDNESDAY...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BEHIND SURFACE/UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH AXIS. EXPECT PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AS SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
WILL HANG AROUND DURING THE DAYTIME. 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO 
AROUND 10-12 C IN THE AFTERNOON. THUS...WILL LOWER CURRENT HIGH 
TEMPERATURES A COUPLE OF DEGREES.  

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...COOL CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE IN ACROSS 
THE MID-SOUTH. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW SURFACE DEWPOINTS DROPPING INTO 
THE UPPER 40S WITH A DECENT AMOUNT OF SUBSIDENCE PRESENT. ALSO CLEAR 
SKIES AND DECOUPLING WINDS OVERNIGHT WOULD SUPPORT LOWERING 
TEMPERATURES A COUPLE OF DEGREES. 

THURSDAY...QUIET AND DRY WEATHER EXPECTED WITH SURFACE HIGH AND

NORTHEASTERLY WINDS ARE FEEDING DEWPOINTS IN THE 50 INTO
NORTHEAST AR...THE MO BOOTHEEL...AND WEST TN. THESE LOWER DEWPOINTS

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH CONTINUING TO WEAKEN...THINK THESE CLOUDS WILL
CONTINUE TO DECREASE TODAY. WILL FORECAST PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES
TODAY...MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT.

HURRICANE JEANNE IS FORECAST TO REMAIN WELL TO OUR EAST. DAYS WILL BE
MILD TO WARM AND NIGHTS COOL FOR THE FIRST PART OF THIS WEEK. A
REINFORCING COOL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL PUSH INTO THE MIDSOUTH
FROM THE NORTHWEST TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. BY THE END OF THE
WEEK...THE HIGH WILL SHIFT EASTWARD ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO WARM
SLIGHTLY. THE GFS INDICATES THERE MAY BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS /
THUNDERSTORMS TOWARD NEXT SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY WITH THE APPROACH
OF AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH / SURFACE COLD FRONT. HOWEVER...THAT IS

CHANCE FOR RAIN THE REMAINDER OF THE MONTH...AND THAT IS JUST A 20

SATELLITE SHOWS MID AND HIGH LEVELS CLOUDS CONTINUE TO STREAM INTO

INTO THE AREA IN THE FLOW LOCATED BETWEEN UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE
ALONG THE EAST COAST AND A WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH FROM WESTERN MO
INTO WESTERN AR. THIS TROUGH WILL MOVE SLOWLY EASTWARD TODAY AND
CONTINUE TO WEAKEN. WILL CONTINUE WITH A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS
TODAY. INSTABILITY WILL BE MARGINAL FOR A FEW THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON. THE LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BE OUT OF THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST
KEEPING THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE RELATIVELY DRY. AS A
RESULT...THINK MOST PRECIPITATION THAT OCCURS TODAY WILL BE LIGHT.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR WILL BEGIN TO SPREAD INTO THE
MIDSOUTH TONIGHT. MODELS / NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER KEEP

KNQA 88-D SHOWING A GOOD DEAL OF CLUTTER AROUND THE RADAR THIS 
EVENING...WITH SOME PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN FALLING FROM MID-LEVEL 
CLOUDS. THESE CLOUDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS 
OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION IVAN. MESOETA MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL SHOW THAT 
LOWER PART OF ATMOSPHERE STILL VERY DRY WITH MID AND UPPER LEVELS 
SATURATED. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY AREA OBS THAT SUGGEST THE LOWEST 
CLOUD DECKS ARE ABOVE 12000FT. VERY TEMPTED TO REMOVE POPS FROM THE 
FORECAST AND REPLACE IT WITH SPRINKLES...ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN 
SOME REPORTS OF LIGHT RAIN JUST NOT MEASURABLE RAIN. WILL LIKELY 
LEAVE POPS ALONE...BUT REMOVE THUNDER AND STRESS LIGHT RAIN. TEMPS

KNQA 88-D SHOWING A GOOD DEAL OF CLUTTER AROUND THE RADAR THIS 
EVENING...WITH SOME PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN FALLING FROM MID-LEVEL 
CLOUDS. THESE CLOUDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS 
OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION IVAN. MESOETA MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL SHOW THAT 
LOWER PART OF ATMOSPHERE STILL VERY DRY WITH MID AND UPPER LEVELS 
SATURATED. THIS IS SUPPORTED BY AREA OBS THAT SUGGEST THE LOWEST 
CLOUD DECKS ARE ABOVE 12000FT. VERY TEMPTED TO REMOVE POPS FROM THE 
FORECAST AND REPLACE IT WITH SPRINKLES...ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN 
SOME REPORTS OF LIGHT RAIN JUST NOT MEASURABLE RAIN. WILL LIKELY 
LEAVE POPS ALONE...BUT REMOVE THUNDER AND STRESS LIGHT RAIN. TEMPS 
AT THIS TIME LOOK REASONABLE.

SOUTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES TO BRING MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF IVAN 
NORTHWARD INTO ARKANSAS. SOME SHOWERS ARE SKIRTING NORTHWESTERN

OVERNIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO CONTROL WEATHER OVER 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. IN ADDITION...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE INTO THE CWA OVERNIGHT AND MAY HELP TO TRIGGER A SHOWER. THE

CURRENT FORECAST / GRIDS SEEM TO BE ON TRACK SO WILL MAKE ONLY SMALL
CHANGES. THE MIDSOUTH IS IN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT THIS MORNING
...BETWEEN A CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST AND STRONG
UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES.
MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ARE SPREADING ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. RADAR
IS INDICATING SOME ECHOES MAINLY ALONG AND WEST OF THE MS RIVER...
SURFACE REPORTS INDICATE THIS TO BE MOSTLY SPRINKLES.

THERE WILL BE A PESKY CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR MUCH OF
THE AREA INTO SATURDAY AS WEAK DISTURBANCES MOVE ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH FROM THE SOUTHWEST. ALTHOUGH WILL LEAVE THE EXTREME
SOUTHEAST PART OF WEST TN INTO NORTHEAST MS DRY TODAY AS HIGH
PRESSURE CONTINUES TO PROTECT THAT REGION. SOME OF THE MOISTURE FROM
THE REMNANTS OF IVAN THAT MOVED INTO THE UPPER TX COAST DURING THE
NIGHT WILL GRADUALLY ADVECT TOWARD OUR AREA. HOWEVER...BOUNDARY LAYER
RELATIVE HUMIDITIES ARE FORECAST TO REMAIN ON THE LOW SIDE ACROSS THE
MIDSOUTH AS LOW LEVEL WINDS FAIL TO TAP INTO GULF MOISTURE. AS A
RESULT...THINK MOST PRECIPITATION THAT OCCURS WILL BE LIGHT. WILL
CONTINUE TO MENTION ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS...ALTHOUGH INSTABILITY
VALUES WILL BE MARGINAL FOR THUNDER.

A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PUSH INTO THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE NORTHWEST
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE FRONT BECOMES INDISCERNIBLE AS SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE BRIDGES ACROSS IT.

WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FROM SATURDAY NIGHT INTO NEXT
WEEK AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR SPREADS OVER THE AREA.

THE MIDSOUTH IS CURRENTLY IN BETWEEN TWO WEATHER SYSTEMS. TO THE 
EAST...A STRONG 500MB RIDGE REMAINS ANCHORED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC 
STATES. TO THE WEST...A POTENT NEGATIVELY TILTED SHORTWAVE IS MOVING 
NE OVER THE RIDGE ACROSS THE PLAIN STATES...WHICH IS HELPING TO 
PUSH A COLD FRONT EAST ACROSS THAT PORTION OF THE COUNTRY. THE 
NET RESULT OVER THE MIDSOUTH IS SOUTHERLY FLOW ALOFT WHICH IS 
HELPING TO BRING IN MOISTURE FROM TROPICAL STORM IVAN.

CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE TONIGHT AS MORE MOISTURE IS PULLED IN 
FROM THE GULF. CLOUDS WILL BE MORE ABUNDANT IN WESTERN ZONES AS THE 
PERSISTENT EAST COAST RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO INFLUENCE THE EASTERN 
ZONES. COOLEST TEMPS TONIGHT WILL BE OVER THE EAST. WENT A FEW 
DEGREES COOLER THAN GUIDANCE IN THESE AREAS DUE TO FEWER CLOUDS 
ALONG WITH THE TREND OF THE GUIDANCE BEING A FEW DEGREES TOO WARM. 

AS IVAN MOVES ONSHORE...MORE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL SPREAD INTO THE 
FAR SW ZONES. WENT 30 POPS OVERNIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. LITTLE TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE OVER THE REST OF THE CWA AS DRY AIR STILL HAS TO BE 
OVERCOME IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE.

MODELS AGREE THAT THE VIGOROUS SHORTWAVE WILL BREAK DOWN THE RIDGE 
ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE COLD FRONT TO SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE AREA BY 
EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. AS THE FRONT MOVES FURTHER EAST...IT WILL 
EVENTUALLY WASH OUT AS IT LOSES ITS UPPER AIR SUPPORT. BEST CHANCE 
OF RAIN WILL REMAIN WEST OF THE RIVER TOMORROW WHERE BEST MOISTURE 
IS LOCATED...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE AREA WIDE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
AS THE FRONT WASHES OUT.

REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS DRY AT THIS TIME. THE COMBINATION OF A 
SFC HIGH BUILDING IN TO THE NORTH AND HURRICANE JEANNE PROGGED TO 
REMAIN WELL EAST OF THE AREA WILL HELP TO ESTABLISH MODERATE NE 
FLOW. MODELS INDICATE A SHORTWAVE WILL APPROACH THE AREA EARLY TO 
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...BUT PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED NE WIND FLOW WILL 
SCOUR OUT MOST BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE. THEREFORE...WILL ELECT TO

.DISCUSSION...

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL REMAIN STATIONARY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF
THE NATION THROUGH THURSDAY THEN WEAKEN FRIDAY. MEANWHILE A STRONG
SHORT WAVE TROF WILL CLOSE OFF OVER THE ROCKYS TODAY THEN MOVE SLOWLY
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE UPPER PLAINS THURSDAY. IT WILL OPEN UP AS
IT MOVES INTO SOUTHERN CANADA NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES FRIDAY. A
RIDGE WILL MOVE INTO THE WESTERN STATES FRIDAY THEN BROADEN ACROSS
THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SATURDAY REACHING
NEW ENGLAND SUNDAY. THIS PATTERN WILL KEEP THE MAIN BELT OF THE
WESTERLIES EXTENDING FROM THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST ACROSS SOUTHERN
CANADA TO NEW ENGLAND. FURTHER SOUTH WILL BE WEAK WESTERLY FLOW
WITH A SERIES OF MINOR IMPULSES FROM THE DESERT SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE SOUTHEAST. THE FLOW WILL REMAIN SPLIT AS A
TROF BUILDS IN THE WEST AND THE RIDGE WEAKENS IN THE EAST MONDAY AND
TUESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL COVER THE EASTERN STATES
INCLUDING THE MID SOUTH THROUGH THURSDAY. RETURN FLOW AROUND THE HIGH
WILL BRING LIMITED MOISTURE INTO THE REGION AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING
COLD FRONT WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. HOWEVER THE FRONT WILL WEAKEN AS
IT MOVES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH EARLY FRIDAY AND ONLY CAUSE A WIND
SHIFT AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW LATE
FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY.

THE RESULT WILL BE DRY WEATHER WITH SEASONAL TEMPERATURES OVER THE
MID SOUTH THROUGH THIS WEEKEND AND INTO NEXT WEEK EXCEPT FOR ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY.

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMNANTS OF HURRICANE IVAN
WILL LIFT OUT EASTWARD ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE TODAY THEN SLOWLY
EASTWARD ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA VIRGINIA BORDER TONIGHT AND
SATURDAY. IT WILL THEN WEAKEN AND RETROGRADE SOUTHWESTWARD ALONG THE
SOUTHEAST COASTAL PLAIN SUNDAY BACK TO ALABAMA MONDAY AND THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY TUESDAY. BEHIND THIS SYSTEM A RIDGE WILL BUILD
OVER THE CENTRAL STATES AND MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY
THEN SLIDE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY NORTH OF THE RETROGRADING LOW TO
THE MID ATLANTIC COAST TUESDAY. MEANWHILE A STRONG TROF WILL MOVE
ACROSS THE ROCKYS AND FINALLY ABSORB WHATS LEFT OF IVAN AS IT ENTERS
THE CENTRAL PLAINS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A LOW PRESSURE AREA ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMNANTS OF
HURRICANE IVAN WILL TAKE A SIMILAR TRACK AS ITS UPPER LEVEL LOW
ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE TO THE SOUTHEAST COASTAL PLAIN BY SATURDAY THEN
WEAKEN AS AN INVERTED TROF OFF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST BY SUNDAY. IN
THE MEANTIME A HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL RIDGE
SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE OHIO AND MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BEHIND THE
EXITING LOW TODAY THROUGH MONDAY. THE HIGH WILL THEN REMAIN
STATIONARY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION TUESDAY THROUGH
THURSDAY.

THE RESULT WILL BE DRY WEATHER WITH SEASONAL TEMPERATURES OVER THE
MID SOUTH FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS EXCEPT FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS
MONDAY.

IVAN CENTERED NEAR TUSCALOOSA ALABAMA. CURRENT FORECAST IS FOR THE 
TRACK TO MOVE NEAR BIRMINGHAM BY 00Z AND JUST EAST OF HUNTSVILLE 
AROUND 09Z. RAIN BANDS FROM THIS SYSTEM ARE HOLDING EAST OF A LINE 
FROM JACKSON TN TO OXFORD MS. SUSTAINED MEASURED WINDS HAVE NOT BEEN 
AS HIGH AS ANTICIPATED OVER NORTHEAST MS...ALTHOUGH THERE HAVE BEEN 
WIND GUSTS AS HIGH AS 50 MPH FROM NEAR COLUMBUS MS AND THERE HAVE 
BEEN REPORTS OF A FEW TREES DOWN IN THAT AREA. A FEW THUNDERSHOWERS 
HAVE DEVELOPED OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS IN RESPONSE TO THE DAYTIME 
HEATING AND INTERACTION WITH A STALLED OUT COOL FRONT. 

EXPECT RAIN TO PULL AWAY FROM THE REGION AND FOR THE AREA TO BE DRY 
AROUND MIDNIGHT. WILL KEEP ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS MENTIONED IN 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS FOR THIS EVENING WITH THE ACTIVITY THERE EXPECTED 
TO DIMINISH WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. WILL CONTINUE ONGOING 
WIND ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS INTO TONIGHT WITH THE WIND FIELD NOT 
EXPECTED TO RELAX UNTIL SOMETIME AFTER MIDNIGHT. WILL DROP LAFAYETTE 
AND YALOBUSHA COUNTIES FROM THE WIND ADVISORY AS WIND OBS FROM 
OXFORD HAVE NOT INDICATED ADVISORY CRITERIA WINDS...SUSTAINED 25MPH. 

SKIES WILL CLEAR TONIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING AS A RIDGE 
BUILDS OVER THE REGION AND REMNANTS OF IVAN MOVE INTO THE 
APPALACHIANS. ETA AND GFS BOTH SHOWING THE REMNANTS OF IVAN ACTUALLY 
MOVING BACK UNDER THE RIDGE AND TOWARDS THE MIDSOUTH BY EARLY NEXT

COLD FRONT NOW LOCATED JUST A LITTLE FURTHER EAST THAN YESTERDAY. THE
FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY EAST TODAY. ANY RAIN THAT FORMS
ALONG THE FRONT WILL NOT REACH OUR FORECAST AREA UNTIL AFTER 00Z
TONIGHT SO KEPT DRY FORECAST GOING FOR TODAY.

HURRICANE IVAN CONTINUES TO PROGRESS NORTH TOWARD MOBILE BAY. LATEST
FORECAST DOESNT SHOW MUCH CHANGE TO PREVIOUS ONES AND MOVES IVAN
THROUGH ALABAMA ON THURSDAY AND EARLY FRIDAY. SOUTHEAST CORNER OF
FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN THE AREA MOST LIKELY TO SEE WIND GUSTS
OF OVER 50 MPH AND HEAVY RAINFALL. WILL GO WITH INLAND TROPICAL STORM
WIND WATCH FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT FOR SOUTHEAST CORNER OF
FORECAST AREA. ALSO THINKING ABOUT FLOOD WATCH FOR THAT AREA AS WELL
BUT HAVE NOT MADE UP OUR MINDS YET.

ALL THE RAIN SHOULD BE OUT OF THE AREA FRIDAY MORNING. DRY WEATHER
WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. EXPECT
ZONES TO BE OUR A LITTLE LATER THAN NORMAL SO WE CAN INCORPORATE NEW
GUIDANCE FROM TPC REGARDING WINDS.

LOW CLOUDS HAVE BROKEN UP THIS AFTERNOON LEAVING A PARTLY CLOUDY AND 
WARM LATE SUMMER AFTERNOON. PLEASANT WEATHER WILL OCCUR TONIGHT AS 
HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT REMAINS OVER THE AREA.

OBVIOUSLY...OUR ATTENTION IS FOCUSED ON HURRICANE IVAN. THE CURRENT
FORECAST IS RATHER STRAIGHT-FORWARD USING THE TRACK OF THE
HURRICANE CENTER...WHICH IS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE GFS.
THE HURRICANE IS FORECAST TO MOVE INLAND AROUND MOBILE AL EARLY
THURSDAY...THEN TRACK NORTH-NORTHEASTWARD THROUGH ALABAMA THURSDAY
AND THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL KEEP OUR FORECAST AREA ON THE WEST
SIDE OF THE STORM. AT THIS THE TIME...CONCERNING OUR FORECAST AREA...
EXPECT THE HEAVIEST RAIN AND STRONGEST WINDS TO MOVE THROUGH
NORTHEAST MS AND THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF WEST TN. EXPECT HEAVIEST
RAIN AMOUNTS TO BE ABOUT 1 TO 2 INCHES AND HIGHEST WINDS GUSTS UP TO
45 MPH DURING THE THURSDAY / THURSDAY NIGHT TIMEFRAME. A WIND
ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED FOR PART OF NORTHEAST MS THURSDAY. AREAS
TO THE NORTHWEST...SUCH AS JONESBORO...WILL SEE ON SLIM CHANCES FOR
RAIN AND LESS WIND. THE TRACK WILL HAVE TO BE CLOSELY MONITORED...
DEVIATIONS TO THE LEFT WILL INCREASE OUR POPS...RAIN AMOUNTS...AND

CHANCE FOR RAIN ENDING. WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST SATURDAY
THROUGH NEXT TUESDAY. THERE ARE SOME INDICATIONS A CHANCE OF SHOWERS
/ THUNDERSTORMS MAY HAVE TO BE ADDED TO THE FORECAST NEXT TUESDAY
WITH THE APPROACH OF AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH / SURFACE COLD FRONT.

1005 AM CDT MON SEP 13 2004

.UPDATE...
CURRENT FORECAST SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE SITUATION. 
HOWEVER...THE WEATHER SITUATION IS EVOLVING AND MAY NEED TO UPDATE 
LATER THIS MORNING. UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER WEST TN IS MOVING ONLY 
SLOWLY EASTWARD. THIS UPPER LOW WILL CAUSE SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS 
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON MAINLY FROM WEST TN INTO NORTHEAST MS. 
UPDATED HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO INDICATE THE CHANCE OF SMALL 
HAIL...STRONG GUSTY WINDS...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS AS THE STORMS 
ARE SLOW MOVING OVER SOME AREAS. CAPES THIS AFTERNOON ARE FORECAST 
AROUND 1800 J/KG WITH LI NEAR MINUS 4 ACROSS EASTERN AREAS OF THE 
MIDSOUTH. MAY NEED TO LOWER MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES AND INCREASE CLOUD 
COVER FOR THIS AFTERNOON FOR SOME LOCATIONS...ESPECIALLY PARTS OF 
WEST TN INTO NORTHEAST MS. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
ISSUED 357 AM CDT MON SEP 13 2004

HAVE OPTED TO INTRODUCE LOW POPS FOR THURSDAY ACROSS NE MS...IN 
EXTENDED FORECAST...AFTER LISTENING TO NHC CONFERENCE CALL. FORECAST 
TRACK HAS BEEN SHIFTED TO THE LEFT...MORE THROUGH ALABAMA ON 
THURSDAY. WEST SIDE OF STORM COULD BRUSH NE MS. HEAVIER PRECIP WILL 
BE EAST OF STORM TRACK...BUT FEEL A MENTION IS NECESSARY FOR PART OF 
MY AREA. HAVE ADJUSTED INCREASED CLOUDS AND LOWERED TEMPS FOR 
THURSDAY IN THAT AREA AS WELL.
&&

.MAIN POINTS OF PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 215 AM...
STILL LOOKING AT A FEW SHRA/TSRA OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CWA.
LOOKS LIKE AN INSTANT REPLAY OF YESTERDAY. TEMPERATURES MAINLY IN
THE 60S. NO INDICATIONS OF FOG YET...BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED
TO SEE SOME BY SUNRISE.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
UPPER VORT STILL RESIDING OVER WEST TENNESSEE...AND MOVING ONLY
VERY SLOWLY EASTWARD. ETA SOUNDINGS STILL SHOW POTENTIAL FOR
CONVECTION ACROSS ABOUT EASTERN HALF OF THE AREA THROUGH AT LEAST
MID-AFTERNOON...BEFORE MID-LEVEL TEMPS WARM ENOUGH TO CAP AIRMASS. IF
CONVECTION IS ANYTHING LIKE YESTERDAY...COULD BE A FEW HAILERS.
FORECAST TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE. TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY SHOULD BE
DRY. SEE LITTLE REASON TO CHANGE TEMPERATURE FORECAST. FRONT TO
NORTHWEST SHOULD REMAIN THERE THROUGH WEDNESDAY...AND IVAN SHOULDNT
BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO AFFECT US QUITE THAT QUICK.
&&

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND BEYOND)...
EARLY PORTION OF EXTENDED FORECAST DEPENDS ON EVENTUAL TRACK OF
IVAN. 00Z RUN OF ETA/NGM WOULD INDICATE LANDFALL MUCH FURTHER WEST
THAN CURRENT TRACK. PLAN TO KEEP WITH NHC TRACK AND KEEP MOST
OF FORECAST AREA DRY. FRIDAY AND BEYOND SHOULD BE DRY ALL AROUND.
TEMPS COOL A LITTLE TOWARD NORMAL NEXT WEEKEND.

A FLAT UPPER RIDGE ALONG WITH A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING
SOUTHWESTWARD OVER THE MIDSOUTH HAS KEPT MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY
CLOUDY SKIES OVER THE AREA TODAY ALONG WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE
MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S.

.SHORT TERM...
THE UPPER RIDGE THAT IS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WILL
BREAK DOWN TONIGHT AND ALLOW A SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL
PLAINS STATES TO MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH LATE
TONIGHT AND ON SUNDAY. ALL OF THE FORECAST MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS
FEATURE WILL CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN FLOW AND FORM A WEAK UPPER LEVEL
LOW OVER OUR AREA THAT WILL LINGER INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK BEFORE
LIFTING NORTHEASTWARD TOWARDS THE MIDWEST ON TUESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE...A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WAS NOTED FROM
AFTERNOON SURFACE OBSERVATIONS STRETCHED ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE
SOUTHWARD ACROSS WEST ALABAMA TO THE GULF COAST. THIS BOUNDARY HAS
PROVIDED THE FOCUS FOR A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER NORTHWEST ALABAMA
INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE THIS AFTERNOON. FORECAST MODELS TEND TO WEAKEN
THIS FEATURE AS IT SLOWLY INCHES NORTHWEST ON SUNDAY.

WITH ALL THIS SAID...BELIEVE THAT A LOW TO MIDDLE LEVEL CLOUD DECK
WILL BE ON THE INCREASE LATER SUNDAY AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY NIGHT.
HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE OUT THE MENTION OF PRECIP AT THIS POINT DUE TO
THE LACK OF GOOD FORCING AND ALSO THE PRESENCE OF DRY AIR ABOVE 700
MB FOR SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...AS NOTED FROM THE 12Z MESO-ETA
FORECAST SOUNDINGS. IF FORCING IS A BIT STRONGER THAN CURRENTLY
FORECAST...LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO INCLUDE ISOLATED POPS ON SUNDAY
AFTERNOON AND AGAIN ON MONDAY AFTERNOON. AT THIS TIME THOUGH...THINK
COVERAGE WILL BE LOW ENOUGH TO LEAVE MENTION OF POPS OUT FOR THESE
TIME PERIODS. TEMPS WILL REMAIN NEAR AVERAGE THROUGH TUESDAY...BUT
MAY BE HELD DOWN A DEGREE OR TWO WITH PRESENCE OF ADDITIONAL CLOUD
COVER.

.LONG TERM...
ALL EYES ARE ON HURRICANE IVAN FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. LATEST 12Z
FORECAST MODEL GUIDANCE SUITES HAVE BEGUN SHIFTING THEIR FORECAST
TRACKS FURTHER TO THE WEST. THIS MAY HAVE SOME IMPLICATIONS TO THE
EXTENDED PERIODS IF A FURTHER WEST TRACK VERIFIES. STILL WAY TOO
EARLY TO NAIL DOWN THE EXACT PATH...AS THIS IS STILL SEVERAL DAYS
OUT. CURRENTLY HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE POPS OUT OF FORECAST AS AN
UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA FOR THE MIDDLE AND END OF NEXT
WEEK AS A LONGWAVE TROUGH DIGS ACROSS THE WESTERN UNITED STATES AND
HELPS AMPLIFY THE EASTERN RIDGE. AGAIN THE CURRENT EXTENDED FORECAST
WILL RELY ON THE EVENTUAL TRACK OF IVAN AND MAY NEED MODIFICATIONS...
SO THIS WILL NEED TO WATCHED. FOR THIS AFTERNOONS FORECAST PACKAGE
HAVE DECIDED TO LEAVE THE EXTENDED PERIOD DRY WITH NEAR NORMAL
TEMPERATURES.

ISSUED 339 PM CDT THU SEP 9 2004

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE AREA
THIS AFTERNOON. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED OVER THE
GREAT LAKES REGION THIS AFTERNOON. THESE WEATHER FEATURES HAVE
PRODUCED MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AREAWIDE WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW TO
MID 80S ALONG WITH LOW HUMIDITY LEVELS TODAY. THESE WEATHER SYSTEMS
WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE MIDSOUTHS WEATHER THROUGH THE END OF
THE WEEK.

OVER THE WEEKEND...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE SOUTHEAST ACROSS
THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE MIDWEST REGION. IN THE UPPER LEVELS...MODELS
INDICATE A WEAK UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE SWINGING THROUGH THE AREA
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD REMAIN TOO DRY
FOR ANY PRECIPITATION...SO ONLY EXPECTING A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUDS
FOR LATE IN THE WEEKEND.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BUILD BACK OVER THE AREA FOR MOST OF
NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER TROUGH DIGS INTO THE WESTERN UNITED STATES.
THIS WILL KEEP WEATHER CONDITIONS DRY WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES
THROUGH THURSDAY. WE WILL ALSO NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON HURRICANE IVAN
FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. CURRENT NHC EXTENDED TRACK FOR IVAN KEEPS
THE HURRICANE WELL TO THE EAST OF OUR AREA...BUT WE WILL NEED TO
MONITOR THIS SYSTEM IN CASE EVENTUAL TRACK SHIFTS FURTHER WESTWARD.
THIS COULD IMPACT THE EXTENDED FORECAST...BUT AT THIS TIME DOES NOT

HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING OVER THE REGION. SATELLITE TODAY SHOWS 
VERY LITTLE IN THE WAY OF CLOUDS AROUND AND MODELS SHOWING 
ATMOSPHERE RATHER DRY. PATTERN DOESNT CHANGE MUCH AT ALL OVER THE 
NEXT SEVEN DAYS. GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK WITHIN REASON. A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE WILL DROP IN FROM THE NORTH ON SUNDAY...BUT ATMOSPHERE IS 
SO DRY THAT THERE IS REALLY NO CHANCE FOR RAIN AND NOT MUCH CHANCES 
FOR CLOUD COVER. TEMPS WILL GRADUALLY MODIFY BACK TO NEAR NORMAL BY 
THE END OF THE WEEK AND THEN COOL OFF A COUPLE DEGREES BY NEXT WEEK

.SHORT TERM...LATEST SURFACE PLOT AND 00Z UPPER AIR ANALYSIS THIS 
MORNING PLACES COLD FRONT AND THE REMNANTS OF FRANCES ALONG THE 
APPALACIANS. 1021 MB HIGH PRESSURE IN THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS 
WILL BUILD IN ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH THIS WEEK. MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON ARE LOWER RELATIVE HUMIDITIES AND WIND GUST 
POTENTIAL ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT INFRARED 
SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS ONLY SCATTERED CUMULUS ACROSS THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.

SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BUILD IN ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH 
TODAY. 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL BE AROUND 15C...PRODUCING HIGHS IN 
THE LOWER 80S WITH DECENT MIXING. 1000-500MB RH/S DROPPING TO 35-40 
PERCENT BY THIS AFTERNOON SUPPORTS MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ACROSS MUCH OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
BELOW 850 MB MAY HANG AROUND THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON AND WENT WITH 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS THE EASTERN ZONES. CURRENT UPSTREAM 
DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S AND WOULD EXPECT RH/S TO 
DROP TO AROUND 30-35 PERCENT THIS AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. 850MB WINDS AROUND 20 KTS WILL MIX DOWN TO THE 
SURFACE THIS AFTERNOON AS MID/UPPER LEVEL SUBSIDENCE CONTINUES TO 
STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE MID-SOUTH.

.LONG TERM...

TONIGHT...SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WITH 1000-500MB LAYER RH/S 
AROUND 40 PERCENT WILL PRODUCE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA ALONG WITH DECOUPLING WINDS. TEMPERATURES WILL FALL 
BACK INTO THE MIDDLE 50S TO LOWER 60S.

THURSDAY...WEAK 500MB SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE UPPER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND WILL NOT HAVE ANY AFFECT ON THE FORECAST AREA 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 1000-500MB LAYER RH/S AROUND 30 PERCENT WILL 
PRODUCE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. 850MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 16C SUPPORT 
HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S.

FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...NOT MUCH CHANGE EXPECTED IN THE OVERALL UPPER AIR 
PATTERN WITH TROUGHING ALONG THE PACIFIC COAST AND EASTERN GREAT 
LAKES/NEW ENGLAND AFFECTING THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES. 
EXTENDED GRIDS SO FAR ARE ON TRACK AND ONLY MADE MINOR TEMPERATURE 
ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPERATURES.

WEATHER PATTERNS THIS MORNING INCLUDE A COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDS FROM 
WESTERN MISSOURI THROUGH EASTERN OKLAHOMA. HIGH PRESSURE IS OVER THE 
MIDSOUTH AND FRANCES IS IN THE GULF NORTHWEST OF TAMPA. SKIES ARE 
MAINLY CLEAR THIS MORNING AND THERE IS A COUPLE OF REPORTS OF 1-2 
MILE FOG BUT NOTHING LIKE THE PAST COUPLE OF MORNINGS. KNQA 88D IS 
DOWN THIS MORNING DUE TO REPAIRS TO THE AIR CONDITIONING UNIT.

TRACK OF FRANCES SO FAR IS CLOSE TO WHAT HAS BEEN SUGGESTED BY 00Z 
GFS FROM YESTERDAY. GFS SEEMS TO HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON THE SYSTEM 
AND CONSISTENTLY TAKES IT OVER THE ALABAMA/GEORGIA BORDER. ETA RUN 
THIS MORNING IS MUCH FURTHER WEST THAN ANY OTHER MODELS AND IS 
LIKELY AN OUTLIER. HAVE WEIGHTED FORECAST HEAVILY ON GFS SOLUTION. 
THIS BRINGS THE COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION LATER TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...RESULTING IN A CHANCE FOR SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS OVER 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. ON TUESDAY...HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS AREAWIDE MAINLY DUE TO THE FRONT AND NOT DUE TO 
FRANCES. FEEL THAT IF 00Z RUN OF GFS PANS OUT THAT EVEN NORTHEAST MS 
WILL BE TOO FAR WEST TO SEE ANY RAIN EFFECTS FROM THIS SYSTEM. WINDS 
WILL LIKELY BE A LITTLE STRONGER THAN NORMAL...10-20MPH WITH HIGHER 
GUSTS. AFTER TUESDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH DIGS INTO THE REGION WITH 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN. TEMPS WILL COOL DOWN NICELY WITH 
HIGHS IN THE LOWER 80S FOR MID TO LATE WEEK AND LOWS IN THE 50S EVEN 
POSSIBLE. THIS PATTERN SHOULD HOLD THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND WITH TEMPS

TWO MAIN FORECAST PROBLEMS THIS MORNING. FIRST BEING FOG CONCERNS 
THIS MORNING...SECOND INVOLVING THE TRACK OF FRANCES. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY SHOWING CLEAR SKIES OVER THE REGION. A FEW LOCATIONS OVER 
WEST TN HAVE ALREADY INDICATED LOW VISIBILITIES THIS MORNING WITH 
OTHER OBS AROUND 3-5 MILES. EXPECT THAT AS MIXING OCCURS AT 
DAYBREAK THAT MANY LOCATIONS OVER WEST TN AND INTO NORTH MISSISSIPPI 
WILL HAVE DENSE FOG. THUS AN ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED UNTIL MID 
MORNING FOR MOST OF WEST TN AND EXTREME NORTH MISSISSIPPI.

HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD PROVIDE MAINLY DRY AND WARM WEATHER OVER THE 
REST OF THE WEEKEND. MODEL SOUNDING MUCH DRIER TOMORROW NIGHT AND 
NOT EXPECTING ANY SERIOUS FOG CONCERNS. MODELS TRY TO BRING A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS MONDAY AFTERNOON AND INTO TUESDAY. 
HAVE LOW CHANCE POPS GOING FOR NOW WITH MODELS INCONSISTENT IN 
STRENGTH OF THE FRONT...FEEL THAT ANY CONVECTION THERE WOULD BE OF 
THE SCATTERED VARIETY. 

00Z RUN OF ETA AND GFS HAVE GONE BACK TO A TRACK OF FRANCES THAT IS 
WELL EAST OF THE REGION. YESTERDAYS 12Z RUN WAS THE FIRST TO BRING 
THE TRACK THIS FAR WEST AND FEEL THAT IT MAY BE THE OUTLYER. FEEL 
THAT A TRACK MORE SIMILAR TO THE 00Z RUN OF SEP 04 MAY END UP 
VERIFYING. THIS IS A TRACK THAT IS PRETTY CLOSE TO THIS MORNING 
TRACK FORECASTED BY HURRICANE CENTER. WITH THAT SAID...HAVE BACKED 
OFF POPS SOMEWHAT AND HAVE LOWERED QPF QUITE A BIT FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY. STILL KEEPING HIGH CHANCE POPS OVER NORTHEAST MS AND NEAR

AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE CENTRAL
ROCKYS ACROSS THE PLAINS TO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT
THROUGH MONDAY. IN THE MEANTIME A RIDGE WILL CONTINUE IN THE EAST.
DEPENDING ON THE TRACK OF HURRICANE FRANCES THE REMNANTS OF THAT
SYSTEM MAY AFFECT THE MID SOUTH LATE TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.
PRESENTLY IT IS FORECAST TO TRACK ACROSS FLORIDA TO THE NORTHEAST
GULF THEN MOVE INLAND AGAIN IN THE WESTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE LATE
MONDAY. IT IS THEN EXPECTED TO MOVE NORTHWARD INTO SOUTHERN ALABAMA
TUESDAY. THE MODELS DIVERGE WITH THE ETA TAKING IT FURTHER WEST
ALONG THE ALABAMA MISSISSIPPI BORDER TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT
WHILE THE GFS RECURVES IT TO NORTHEAST ALABAMA BY WEDNESDAY MORNING.
MOST AFFECTED WILL BE EAST PORTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH. THE SYSTEM
WILL THEN LIFT NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE LATE WEDNESDAY
AND CONTINUE ALONG THE APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY.
IN ITS WAKE A TROF WILL COVER THE EAST AS A RIDGE BUILDS IN THE
SOUTHWEST. THIS RIDGE WILL MOVE EASTWARD TO THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL COVER THE NATION EAST OF THE
MISSISSIPPI RIVER TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY AS IT MOVES SLOWLY EASTWARD.
HURRICANE FRANCES WILL SLOWLY CROSS FLORIDA TONIGHT AND SUNDAY THEN
ENTER THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO SUNDAY NIGHT. IT WILL THEN MAKE
LANDFALL AGAIN IN THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE MONDAY AND TRACK SLOWLY
ACROSS THE PANHANDLE MONDAY NIGHT INTO SOUTHERN ALABAMA TUESDAY. A
COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY THEN
MERGE WITH THE REMNANTS OF THE HURRICANE TUESDAY THROUGH EARLY
WEDNESDAY AS THE HURRICANE TRACKS NORTHWARD THROUGH ALABAMA. THE
SYSTEM WILL LIFT OUT TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATE WEDNESDAY AND
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE MID SOUTH BEHIND IT WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AND THURSDAY. THE HIGH WILL COVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

THE RESULT WILL BE WARM AND HUMID WEATHER OVER THE MID SOUTH TODAY
THROUGH MONDAY WITH ISOLATED OR SCATTERED MAINLY DIURNAL SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BECOME MORE
NUMEROUS MAINLY EAST PORTIONS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH THE

OBSERVATIONS ACROSS MANY LOCATIONS IN WEST TENNESSEE AND EXTREME 
NORTH MISSISSIPPI HAVE FALLEN TO OR BELOW QUARTER OF A MILE AT TIMES 
THIS MORNING. TERRAIN...CLEAR SKIES...LIGHT WINDS AND MOIST BOUNDARY 
LAYER ARE RESPONSIBLE. A DENSE FOG ADVISORY HAS BEEN ISSUED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

WATER VAPOR SHOWS DRYING TAKING PLACE BEHIND UPPER TROUGH AXIS THAT 
EXTENDS FROM MIDDLE TN THROUGH NORTHEAST MS. THIS TROUGH WILL 
CONTINUE TO SHIFT SOUTH AND EAST OF THE REGION EARLY THIS MORNING. 
GFS/ETA INDICATES THAT THERE IS STILL A GOOD DEAL OF LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE AROUND AND MESOETA SOUNDINGS NOT SHOWING MUCH OF A CAP WITH 
A CONVECTIVE TEMP IN THE MID 80S. SO THINK THAT THERE WILL BE 
AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ALTHOUGH NOT CERTAIN AS TO JUST HOW 
WIDESPREAD ACTIVITY WILL BE. THINK THAT THE MAV GUIDANCE VALUES MAY 
BE TOO HIGH WITH THE GFS 850-500 RH FIELDS HIGHER THAN WHAT IS 
PRESENTLY SHOWN ON WATER VAPOR. ETA LOOKS A LITTLE BETTER IN 
HANDLING THE MOISTURE SO FAVOR THE MET GUIDANCE VALUES OF 20 
POP...SINCE THERE MAY BE ACTIVITY AROUND WILL WORD WEATHER TODAY AS 
ISOLATED VS SLIGHT CHANCE. 

UPPER ANTICYCLONE MOVES OVER HEAD AND SHOULD PROVIDE DRY WEATHER 
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WITH HIGHS NEAR OR A COUPLE DEGREES 
ABOVE NORMAL. HAVE RISEN POPS MAINLY EAST OF THE MS RIVER FOR 
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WITH A TRACK OF THE REMNANTS FROM FRANCES 
MOVING UP THROUGH ALABAMA. EVEN THOUGH GFS THIS MORNING HAS A TRACK 
THAT IS MORE WESTWARD OVER WESTERN ALABAMA...NOT WILLING TO RAISE

POPS WHERE THEY ARE AT ON TUESDAY. IT IS POSSIBLE..ESPECIALLY WITH

SURFACE WINDS THIS MORNING ARE RATHER LIGHT AND ANY FEATURES ARE 
ILL-DEFINED. THERE MAY BE A WEAK BOUNDARY ALONG THE OHIO VALLEY  
INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS WHERE THERE IS A WEAKNESS IN THE PRESSURE 
FIELD ALONG WITH A DEW POINT GRADIENT. MAIN FEATURES TO IMPACT THE 
MIDSOUTH WEATHER TODAY ARE ALOFT. WATER VAPOR SHOWS AN UPPER VORT 
OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS ALONG WITH AN ASSOCIATED TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING 
SOUTHWESTWARD INTO TEXAS. IR SATELLITE SHOWS A STREAM OF MID AND 
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE TROUGH AXIS MOVING INTO THE REGION. 
KNQA 88D HAS DETECTED SOME LIGHT ECHOS SOUTHWEST OF THE 
RADAR...GENERALLY FALLING APART AS THEY APPROACH. BELIEVE THE RADAR 
IS SEEING THE MID-LEVEL CLOUDS WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF VIRGA BENEATH. 

TODAY...NO LOW LEVEL FEATURES TO ASSIGN POPS TO. MODELS SHOWING A 
JET MAX MOVING OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI AND WEST TENNESSEE TODAY. 
COMBINED WITH SOME SURFACE HEATING...THIS FEATURE MAY BE ENOUGH FOR 
A BETTER CHANCE OF THUNDERSHOWERS TODAY OVER NORTH MS AND WEST TN. 
CLOUDS SHOULD BREAK UP THIS AFTERNOON OVER WESTERN HALF OF FORECAST 
AREA AS SUBSIDENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS INTO THE 
REGION. CLOUD COVER WILL HOLD BACK TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES AHEAD 
OF THE TROUGH AXIS...BUT STILL MID TO UPPER 80S AREAWIDE LIKELY. 

LINGER POPS OVER NORTHEAST MS THIS EVENING AS THE TROUGH AXIS MOVES 
THROUGH. EXPECT AT LEAST PARTIAL CLEARING TONIGHT AND WITH MESOETA 
SOUNDINGS SHOWING A GOOD DEAL OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE GETTING TRAPPED 
BENEATH THE NOCTURNAL INVERSION...EXPECT PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP. 

UPPER ANTICYCLONE SHOULD MOVE OVER THE REGION ON SATURDAY AND 
850-500MB MOISTURE LOOKS RATHER LOW. HOWEVER SOUNDINGS NOT SHOWING 
MUCH OF A CAP IN PLACE SO CANT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED AFTERNOON 
THUNDERSHOWER. 850 TEMPS ARE SLIGHTLY WARMER (+17) CORRELATING INTO 
HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S. 

850-500 MOISTURE LOOKS EVEN LESS SAT NITE AND SUNDAY...COMBINED WITH 
POSITION OF UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE HAVE REMOVED MENTION OF RAIN. 
FORECAST AFTER THIS WEEKEND IS COMPLICATED WITH THE EXACT TRACK OF 
FRANCES AND WHATEVER BLOCKING EFFECTS IT MAY HAVE ON FUTURE SYSTEMS. 
HAVE AT THIS TIME LEFT CURRENT FORECAST ALONE...WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE 
OF RAIN POSSIBLE ON MONDAY EITHER BY AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT OR 
ORDINARY AFTERNOON CONVECTION. THEN A CHANCE OF RAIN ON TUESDAY WITH 
THE WESTERN FRINGE OF FRANCES POSSIBLY AFFECTING THE AREA.

HAVE NO PLANS TO INCLUDE MENTION OF PRECIP IN FIRST PERIOD OF

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH SATURDAY)...
STILL IN A MEAN RIDGE POSITION...WITH VERY WEAK IMPULSES RUNNING
ALONG THE RIM OF THE RIDGE. ONE OF THESE IMPULSES OVER OK THIS
AFTERNOON WILL WEAKEN AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE AREA TOMORROW. MOISTURE
THROUGH THE COLUMN WILL BE A LITTLE GREATER AND AIRMASS A LITTLE MORE
UNSTABLE TOMORROW...SO EXPECT A LITTLE BETTER AREAL COVERAGE OF
DIURNAL CONVECTION. EVEN 20 PERCENT POPS MAY BE OVERKILL...BUT WILL
HOLD ON TO A MENTION. CURRENT FORECAST TEMPS FOR TOMORROW MAY BE TOO
WARM BY A DEGREE OR TWO...BUT WILL HOLD ON FOR NOW. DID BUMP UP TEMPS
A DEGREE OR TWO FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

SATURDAY ANOTHER DAY OF ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION. HELD ON TO POPS
INTO NIGHTTIME HOURS ON SATURDAY DUE TO POTENTIAL FOR TROF TO THE
WEST TO BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO TRIGGER PRECIP LATE SATURDAY NIGHT.
PERSISTENCE FOR TEMPS SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.
&&

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY AND BEYOND)...
CONFIDENCE IN EXTENDED FORECAST IS LOW. THIS IS DUE TO THE
UNCERTAINTY OF TRACK OF HURRICANE FRANCES...AS WELL AS THE STRENGTH
OF THE UPPER TROF THAT IS EXPECTED TO PASS TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA
SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SEEM TO BE COMING AROUND TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT
FRANCES WILL CROSS FLORIDA AND MOVE INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. IF THIS
OCCURS...OUR CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION WILL INCREASE CONSIDERABLY.
CURRENT FORECAST TRACK FROM NHC TRACKS STORM TO THE EAST OF OUR CWA.
SUBSIDENCE FROM THE SYSTEM WOULD KEEP MOST OR ALL OF OUR CWA DRY.

FEW SHOWERS POSSIBLE IN EXTREME EASTERN PORTION OF CWA. THIS WAS IN
AFTERNOON PORTION OF FORECAST...SO WILL JUST REMOVE THE TEMPORAL
DESCRIPTION.

DONT SEE ANY REASON TO CHANGE TEMPS OR CLOUD COVER DESCRIPTION THIS
EARLY. BASED ON YESTERDAYS TEMPS...ETC...CURRENT TEMP FORECAST
SHOULD BE OK.

WITH HURRICANE FRANCES TRACK STILL IN QUESTION...NOT PLANNING ON
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO EXTENDED FORECAST. WILL REASSESS AFTER 12Z

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE EASTERN STATES TODAY AND
FRIDAY THEN REMAIN STATIONARY OVER THE WEEKEND. WEAK UPPER LEVEL
DISTURBANCES WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. A TROF WILL MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE ROCKYS
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY THEN CLOSE OFF OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS SUNDAY.
IT WILL THEN LIFT UP INTO CANADA NORTH OF LAKE SUPERIOR SUNDAY NIGHT
AND MONDAY. IN ITS WAKE WILL BE A BROAD TROF ACROSS THE NATION FROM
THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST TO THE GREAT LAKES. MEANWHILE THE RIDGE IN THE
EAST WILL BREAK DOWN AS HURRICANE FRANCES MOVES INTO FLORIDA SUNDAY
AND CONTINUES SOMEWHERE INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES MONDAY AND
TUESDAY. A RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE SOUTHWEST AND EXTEND EASTWARD
ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL COVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF
THE NATION TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY AS IT MOVES SLOWLY EASTWARD. A
COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE MID SOUTH FROM THE WEST SATURDAY. WITH
THE HELP OF CIRCULATION BEHIND HURRICANE FRANCES THE FRONT WILL MOVE
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH SOMETIME SUNDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT DEPENDING THE
TRACK OF THE HURRICANE. THE RESULT WILL DRY WEATHER EXCEPT FOR
ISOLATED MAINLY DIURNAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY THROUGH LABOR
DAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING DRY AND SLIGHTLY COOLER WEATHER TUESDAY

.SHORT TERM...LATEST SURFACE PLOT PLACES HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE 
MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS DIURNAL 
CUMULUS WHICH DEVELOPED IN RESPONSE TO A SMALL POCKET OF LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER SUBSIDENCE INVERSION. REGIONAL 88D RADARS IN 
ALABAMA SHOW SOME RETURN FLOW MOISTURE BEGINNING TO WORK ITS WAY 
NORTH AGAIN. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN TONIGHT WILL BE LOW TEMPERATURES. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD NOT BE MUCH DIFFERENT THAN LAST NIGHT AS CURRENT 
DEWPOINTS ARE MAINLY IN THE 60S ACROSS THE CWA THIS AFTERNOON. 

LONG TERM...OBVIOUSLY THE MAIN FOCUS FOR THE LONG TERM WILL BE THE 
PROGRESSION OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH AS IT MOVES FROM THE WESTERN TO 
CENTRAL US...AND HOW THE FUTURE REMAINS OF HURRICANE FRANCES AFFECTS 
THE MID-SOUTH BY EARLY NEXT WEEK.

THURSDAY...SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH WILL 
BEGIN TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA. BOTH THE ETA AND GFS INDICATE A 
WEAK 500MB SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY 
EVENING. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW SURFACE BASED PARCELS WILL PRODUCE 
CAPES AROUND 1900 J/KG...AND LIS AROUND -4. A LIMITING FACTOR TO 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS WILL BE THE 
PRESENCE OF A CAPPING INVERSION JUST ABOVE 700MB. AS A RESULT I WENT 
WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FAR 
EASTERN COUNTIES ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE 
SLIGHTLY ON FRIDAY AS MORE MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR DIURNALLY 
DRIVEN CONVECTION AND LITTLE IF ANY CAPPING INVERSION WILL BE PRESENT.  

SATURDAY...SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL BE MINIMAL AS TROUGH 
ACROSS THE WESTERN US DIGS FURTHER SOUTH...AND AMPLIFYING THE MID 
LEVEL RIDGE ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. LITTLE IF ANY MID/UPPER LEVEL 
FORCING WILL BE PRESENT AND KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS IN FORECAST.

EXTENDED...SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT 
THE FORECAST AREA BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND. LATEST 00Z GFS/EUROPEAN 
RUNS SLOWING DOWN THE PROGRESSION OF THE TROF OVER THE CENTRAL US AS 
HURRICANE FRANCES COMES ONSHORE IN THE SOUTHEAST US AROUND FLORIDA. 
THIS SEEMS TO BE A REASONABLE SOLUTION AS THE UPPER AIR FLOW TYPICALLY SLOWS 
DOWN A BIT WITH THE MERGER OF TROPICAL REMNANTS INTO THE MEAN FLOW. 
MODELS STILL INDICATE BEST FORCING WITH THE SHORTWAVE WILL REMAIN TO 
THE NORTH AND LEFT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR SUNDAY.  
AT THIS TIME I WENT WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND 
WEDNESDAY...HOWEVER IF THE REMNANTS TRACK FURTHER WEST SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEFINITELY BE A POSSIBLITY.

MIDNIGHT. SFC ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT SFC DEWPOINTS ARE A LITTLE 
HIGHER ACRS ERN SXNS OF THE MID SOUTH. CLEAR SKIES...LIGHT WINDS AND 
LEFTOVER SFC MOISTURE SHOULD RESULT IN SOME PATCHY FOG ACRS MAINLY 
EASTERN SXNS AFT MIDNIGHT. TEMPS LOOK GOOD. WL NEED TO UPDATE SKY 
CONDITION OTRW FORECAST ON TRACK.

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 344 PM...

SHORT TERM...LATEST SURFACE PLOT CONTINUING TO SHOW COOLER HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING IN ACROSS THE MIDDLE/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 
DIURNAL CUMULUS NOT LASTING VERY LONG AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS MOVES EAST INTO THE MID-SOUTH. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN 
FOR TONIGHT WILL BE LOW TEMPERATURES. CURRENT UPSTREAM DEWPOINTS 
ACROSS THE OZARKS ARE IN THE UPPER 50S TO AROUND 60 AND LOWER TO 
MIDDLE 60S ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE. LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT ACROSS 
THE AREA WILL DROP TO NEAR CURRENT DEWPOINTS WITH DECENT RADIATIONAL 
COOLING AND LIGHT WINDS. I ADDED A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG ACROSS THE 
EASTERN COUNTIES TONIGHT WHERE CLOUD COVER AND RESIDUAL MOISTURE HAS 
BEEN SLOW TO DEPART.

LONG TERM...FAIRLY QUIET AND PRECIPITATION FREE WEATHER PATTERN 
EXPECTED ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THROUGH THURSDAY AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
MOVE EAST INTO THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES. ON TUESDAY MOSTLY SUNNY TO 
SUNNY SKIES CAN BE EXPECTED AS 1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S WILL BE AROUND 
40 PERCENT AT BEST. 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 15C AND PRESENCE OF 
DECENT MIXING WILL SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S. HIGH 
PRESSURE IN PLACE ON WEDNESDAY WILL PRODUCE ANOTHER NICE DAY ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA AS 1000-500MB RH/S WILL BE AGAIN AROUND 40 
PERCENT. DECENT MIXING AND 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 15C WILL 
PRODUCE HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S. 


THURSDAY...A SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL WAVE WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
GULF COAST NEAR LOUISIANA AND MOVE NORTH NORTHEAST ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA INTO FRIDAY. THE ETA MODEL IS SLIGHTLY STRONGER IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE WAVE IN THE GULF THAN THE GFS. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS PRODUCE SURFACE BASED CAPES AROUND 1500 J/KG...LI/S AROUND 
-4...SHOWALTER INDICIES AROUND -1 WHICH JUSTIFIES THUNDER IN THE 
FORECAST ACROSS SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES. HEAVY RAIN COULD BE A 
POSSIBILITY THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE

LONG RANGE MODELS SOMEWHAT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE PROGRESSION OF A 
LONG WAVE TROUGH ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. BY THIS WEEKEND AND 
AFFECTING THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY. HOWEVER THE TRACK OF 
HURRICANE FRANCES IS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME WITH THE 
PREVIOUS GFS RUN AND EUROPEAN FAVORING A TRACK ACROSS FLORIDA AND 
THE GULF OF MEXICO WHILE THE UKMET AND LATEST GFS RUN FAVORING A

SKIES CAN BE EXPECTED AS 1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S WILL BE AROUND 40 
PERCENT AT BEST. 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 15C AND PRESENCE OF 
DECENT MIXING WILL SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S. HIGH 
PRESSURE IN PLACE ON WEDNESDAY WILL PRODUCE ANOTHER NICE DAY ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA AS 1000-500MB RH/S WILL BE AGAIN AROUND 40 
PERCENT. DECENT MIXING AND 850 MB TEMPERATURES AROUND 15C WILL 
PRODUCE HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 80S. 


THURSDAY...A SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL WAVE WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
GULF COAST NEAR LOUISIANA AND MOVE NORTH NORTHEAST ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA INTO FRIDAY. THE ETA MODEL IS SLIGHTLY STRONGER IN THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE WAVE IN THE GULF THAN THE GFS. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS PRODUCE SURFACE BASED CAPES AROUND 1500 J/KG...LI/S AROUND 
-4...SHOWALTER INDICIES AROUND -1 WHICH JUSTIFIES THUNDER IN THE 
FORECAST ACROSS SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES. HEAVY RAIN COULD BE A 
POSSIBILITY THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE 
AT OR ABOVE 1.5 INCHES. 

LONG RANGE MODELS SOMEWHAT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE PROGRESSION OF A 
LONG WAVE TROUGH ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. BY THIS WEEKEND AND 
AFFECTING THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY. HOWEVER THE TRACK OF 
HURRICANE FRANCES IS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME WITH THE

344 PM CDT MON AUG 30 2004


SHORT TERM...LATEST SURFACE PLOT CONTINUING TO SHOW COOLER HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING IN ACROSS THE MIDDLE/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 
DIURNAL CUMULUS NOT LASTING VERY LONG AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS MOVES EAST INTO THE MID-SOUTH. MAIN FORECAST CONCERN 
FOR TONIGHT WILL BE LOW TEMPERATURES. CURRENT UPSTREAM DEWPOINTS 
ACROSS THE OZARKS ARE IN THE UPPER 50S TO AROUND 60 AND LOWER TO 
MIDDLE 60S ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE. LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT ACROSS 
THE AREA WILL DROP TO NEAR CURRENT DEWPOINTS WITH DECENT RADIATIONAL 
COOLING AND LIGHT WINDS. I ADDED A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG ACROSS THE 
EASTERN COUNTIES TONIGHT WHERE CLOUD COVER AND RESIDUAL MOISTURE HAS 
BEEN SLOW TO DEPART.

LONG TERM...FAIRLY QUIET AND PRECIPITATION FREE WEATHER PATTERN EXPECTED 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THROUGH THURSDAY AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGE MOVE EAST 
INTO THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES. ON TUESDAY MOSTLY SUNNY TO SUNNY 
SKIES CAN BE EXPECTED AS 1000-500 MB LAYER RH/S WILL BE AROUND 40

SHORT TERM...LATEST SURFACE PLOT DEPCITS SURFACE COLD FRONT 
STRETCHING FROM NEW ENGLAND TO THE SOUTHERN GULF COAST INTO TEXAS. 
12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW 500 MB LONG WAVE TROUGH BISECTING THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. A FEW AREAS THIS MORNING REPORTED LIGHT 
DRIZZLE ASSOCIATED WITH LOW CEILINGS AND RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE. THIS HAS SINCE COME TO AN END AS DRY AIR CONTINUES TO 
BUILD IN ACROSS EASTERN ARKANSAS/WESTERN TENNESSEE.

MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS FOR THIS AFTERNOON ARE CLOUD COVER AND 
TEMPERATURES. 12Z RAOBS FROM KLIT AND KJAN BOTH SHOW INCREASING 
MID/UPPER LEVEL SUBSIDENCE WITH A SHALLOW MOIST LAYER./SURFACE-825 
MB/ THIS IS SUPPORTED WELL BY WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AS DRY AIR 
ADVECTING INTO THE FORECAST AREA FROM MISSOURI/ARKANSAS. VISIBILE 
SATELLITE HAS INDICATED SOME DIURNAL CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT ALONG I-55 
LATE THIS MORNING...BUT THINK THE CLOUD COVER WILL GRADUALLY 
DECREASE AS THE DRY AIR CONTINUES TO BUILD IN FROM THE 
NORTHWEST...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE WESTERN ZONES. HIGH TEMPERATURES 
IN THE GRIDS FOR THIS AFTERNOON SEEMED REASONABLE WITH 850MB 
TEMPERATURES AROUND 14C AND DECREASING CLOUD COVER...THUS I DID NOT 
MAKE ANY TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS AT THIS TIME. 

CHASKELSON

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED 251 AM CDT MON AUG 30 2004. 
EARLY THIS MORNING LOW CLOUDS COVERED THE EASTERN 3/4 OF THE 
FORECAST AREA IN THE WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BUILD INTO THE MID SOUTH FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. LOW/MID 
LEVEL DRY AIR WILL ADVECT INTO THE AREA AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
TRANSLATES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TODAY. PLEASANT DAYTIME MAX TEMPS 
AND COOLER THAN SEASONAL NORMS EXPECTED FOR OVERNIGHT LOWS.

THE CHALLENGE THIS FORECAST PACKAGE WILL BE THE TIMING OF THE NEXT 
SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE REGION. A WEAK EASTERLY WAVE IS DEPICTED BY 
BOTH THE GFS AND ETA. THE VORT MAX IS SHOWN ALONG COASTAL ALABAMA ON 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WITH THE SHEAR AXIS SLANTING TOWARD ATLANTA 
BASED ON THE 00Z ETA RUN. THE GFS IS A LOT SLOWER AND HANDLES THE 
MOISTURE DIFFERENTLY. STILL A LITTLE UNCERTAINTY ON WHAT WILL

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WERE DIMINISHING OVER THE MIDWEST THIS 
MORNING. STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WERE MOVING SOUTHWARD INTO THE RED 
RIVER VALLEY AND THE LOW ROLLING PLAINS OF TEXAS. THESE STORMS 
FORMED AHEAD OF A STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT. 

CONVECTION WHICH FIRED OVER CENTRAL MISSOURI/ILLINOIS HAS SENT AN 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY SURGING SOUTHWARD TOWARD THE MID SOUTH. THIS 
FEATURE IS EVIDENT ON IR SATELLITE IMAGERY AND ROUGHLY LOCATED JUST 
NORTH OF THE MO BOOTHEEL BISECTING PADUCAH KY. MID LEVEL CLOUDS HAVE 
BEEN ENHANCING SINCE MIDNIGHT OVER WEST TN AND CENTRAL AR. THE MID 
LEVEL CLOUDS HAVE EXTENDED SOUTHWARD INTO NORTH MS. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THIS REGION OF MID LEVEL ENHANCEMENT 
AND WILL LIKELY PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY.

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WERE DIMINISHING OVER THE MIDWEST THIS 
MORNING. STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WERE MOVING SOUTHWARD INTO THE RED 
RIVER VALLEY AND THE LOW ROLLING PLAINS OF TEXAS. THESE STORMS 
FORMED AHEAD OF A STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT. 

CONVECTION WHICH FIRED OVER CENTRAL MISSOURI/ILLINOIS HAS SENT AN 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY SURGING SOUTHWARD TOWARD THE MID SOUTH. THIS 
FEATURE IS EVIDENT ON IR SATELLITE IMAGERY AND ROUGHLY LOCATED JUST 
NORTH OF THE MO BOOTHEEL BISECTING PADUCAH KY. MID LEVEL CLOUDS HAVE 
BEEN ENHANCING SINCE MIDNIGHT OVER WEST TN AND CENTRAL AR. THE MID 
LEVEL CLOUDS HAVE EXTENDED SOUTHWARD INTO NORTH MS. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THIS REGION OF MID LEVEL ENHANCEMENT 
AND WILL LIKELY PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY.

WITH THE ONGOING INSTABILITY AND APPROACHING OUTFLOW BOUNDARY RAIN 
CHANCES TODAY WILL BE VERY HIGH. MAX TEMPERATURES WILL BE HIGHLY 
DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER AND WET GROUND. SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP WILL 
MOVE SLOWLY NORTH SO LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE TODAY.

THE UPPER TROUGH WILL TAKE ITS TIME DRIFTING ACROSS THE MIDWEST. 
UNTIL IT DOES SO BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...THE FRONT WILL REMAIN NORTH

SKIES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WERE MOSTLY CLEAR EARLY THIS MORNING. A 
LARGE COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS THAT FORMED AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT WAS 
LOCATED OVER NORTHERN MISSOURI AND SOUTHERN IOWA. A LONG WAVE TROUGH 
WAS LOCATED ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE U.S. WHILE THE SOUTHEAST 
U.S. WAS UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A SUBTROPICAL HIGH.

DEW POINTS IN THE LOWER TO MID 70S BLANKET THE REGION AGAIN THIS 
MORNING. THERE IS A HINT AT SLIGHT DRYING ALOFT...HOWEVER DONT FEEL 
THAT THIS WILL CAUSE ANY RELIEF HERE ON THE GROUND SINCE HIGH 
MOISTURE VALUES WILL REMAIN. THE AIRMASS OVER THE MID SOUTH IS THE 
SAME AS YESTERDAY...THEREFORE WE CAN EXPECT MUCH THE SAME WEATHER 
TODAY - PERHAPS SLIGHTLY WARMER THIS AFTERNOON. WITH MARGINALLY 
UNSTABLE AIR AND PLENTIFUL MOISTURE WILL NOT RULE OUT A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON.

THE COLD FRONT CURRENTLY STRETCHING FROM SOUTHERN IOWA TO THE 
NORTHERN TEXAS PANHANDLE WILL APPROACH THE NORTHWEST PORTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. THE FRONT WILL LIKELY TAKE ITS TIME MOVING 
INTO THE MID SOUTH. THIS IS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE LONGWAVE TROUGH 
OVER THE WESTERN U.S. WILL NOT MAKE ITS WAY INTO THE MID SECTION OF 
THE U.S. UNTIL SATURDAY AFTERNOON. IN THE MEANTIME...THE MOISTURE 
LADEN AIR OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE PRIMED FOR THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT AS LIFT INCREASES AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. RAIN CHANCES 
WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE TONIGHT WITH THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN 
OCCURRING SATURDAY. THE RAIN WILL TAPER OFF AFTER THE FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH THE AREA FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST.

A WARM FRONT OVER THE CWA EXTENDING ROUGHLY OVER MEMPHIS INTO 
EXTREME NRN MS WILL MOVE TOWARDS THE N BORDER OF THE CWA BY 12Z MON. 
SOME LINGERING TSTMS ARE EXITING THE SE CORNER OF NRN MS. DO NOT 
EXPECT MUCH FORCING TO PRODUCE ANYTHING MORE THAN AN ISOLATED TSTM 
OVERNIGHT. SOME FOG IS POSSIBLE...BUT NOT SURE TO WHAT EXTENT AT 
THIS TIME. CURRENT FCST IS ON TRACK FOR NOW BUT MAY NEED MINOR 
ADJUSTMENTS REGARDING POPS AND FOG POTENTIAL SHORTLY.

A SUB-TROPICAL HIGH WILL BUILD INTO THE SE STATES FROM THE GULF AND 
WRN ATLANTIC THROUGH THE WEEK. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE TYPICAL 
SUMMER-LIKE WEATHER WITH WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS. A SERIES OF WEAK 
SHORTWAVES WILL PROVIDE PROVIDE CHCS OF SHWRS/TSTMS EACH DAY.

A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NW SAT AND MOVE THROUGH THE AREA

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ALONG A 
STATIONARY FRONT THAT IS LOCATED JUST SOUTH OF TUPELO MS TO NEAR 
SEARCY AR. FRONT EXPECTED TO SLOWLY MOVE NORTHWARD TONIGHT AS A WARM 
FRONT. EXPECT ISOLATED SHRA/TSRA ACTIVITY ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE 
FRONT.

FRONT SHOULD BE LOCATED SOMEWHERE NEAR WEST PLAINS MO TO NEAR 
HUNTINGDON TN BY 12Z MONDAY. WITH THE MIDSOUTH BEING IN THE WARM 
SECTOR EXPECT SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA TO DEVELOP ESPECIALLY IN THE 
AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION...A SHORTWAVE WILL BRUSH NORTHERN SECTIONS OF 
THE CWA. THIS WILL ALSO HELP TO TRIGGER SHRA/TSRA ACTIVITY. WILL GO 
WITH A 40 TO 50 POP ACROSS THE CWA.

RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE MIDDLE TO END OF THE WEEK AS 
SEVERAL SHORTWAVES MOVE IN AND OUT OF THE CWA. EXPECT BEST CHANCES 
FOR RAIN WILL OCCUR IN AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS SO WILL CONTINUE 
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS DURING THESE TIME PERIODS.

THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO APPROACH THE CWA ON SATURDAY 
CONTINUING THE CHANCES FOR SHRA/TSRA. FRONTAL PASSAGE LOOKS TO BE

ZONAL FLOW WITH A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES AND IMPULSES WILL GRADUALLY
AMPLIFY OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AS SHORT WAVES CARVE A TROF IN THE
WEST AND A RIDGE BUILDS IN THE SOUTH AND EAST. THE TROF WILL WEAKEN
AND SHEAR OUT TO THE GREAT LAKES SATURDAY AND THE RIDGE WILL BUILD
OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE NATION.

AT THE SURFACE LIGHT OR CALM WINDS HUMID AIR AND WET GROUND FROM
PREVIOUS RAINS ARE CAUSING FOG TO FORM OVER MUCH OF THE MID SOUTH
EARLY THIS MORNING. AT THIS TIME A FEW PLACES ARE EXPERIENCING DENSE
FOG WITH VISIBILITIES OF 1/2 MILE OR LESS. IF DENSE FOG BECOMES MORE
WIDESPREAD A FOG ADVISORY WILL HAVE TO BE ISSUED.

A STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES WILL MOVE NORTHWARD
INTO THE MID SOUTH AS A WARM FRONT TODAY THEN DISSIPATE BY TONIGHT AS
WINDS BECOME SOUTHERLY. THIS WILL CAUSE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY IN THE SOUTH HALF OF THE REGION TODAY AND
TONIGHT. A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL THEN COVER THE EASTERN AND
SOUTHERN STATES TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY AS LOW PRESSURE AREAS SHEAR
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE GREAT LAKES. A COLD
FRONT WILL APPROACH THE MID SOUTH FROM THE WEST FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.
THE RESULT WILL BE WARMER AND MORE HUMID WEATHER THIS WEEK WITH
CHANCES OF MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
THE APPROACH OF THE COLD FRONT WILL BRING BETTER CHANCES OF RAIN

FURTHER NORTH. THE UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE EAST OF THE

TEMPERATURES DOWN TODAY.

THE FRONT WILL LIFT BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT BY SUNDAY WITH
MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR SPREADING BACK OVER ALL OF THE MIDSOUTH. WEAK

AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TODAY. THIS
IS FORECAST TO RESULT IN A SURFACE LOW DEEPENING OVER SOUTHERN MO
THIS MORNING AND MOVING NORTHEASTWARD DURING THE DAY. THIS WILL PUSH
A COLD FRONT TOWARD NORTHEAST AR / MO BOOTHEEL FROM THE NORTHWEST BY
LATE IN THE DAY. THIS MEANS THAT WE CAN EXPECT WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS TODAY AS WE RETURN TO AN UNUSUAL WEATHER PATTERN FOR
SUMMER. THE THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER APPEARS LOW AS CLOUDS AND RAIN
WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES DOWN. FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES ARE VERY
HIGH SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT FLOODING PROBLEMS.

THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN MOSTLY WESTERLY THE NEXT FEW DAYS
WITH HEIGHTS BELOW NORMAL. AS A RESULT...THE COLD FRONT IS FORECAST
TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH BY SATURDAY...

AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH TODAY. THIS
IS FORECAST TO RESULT IN A SURFACE LOW DEEPENING OVER SOUTHERN MO
THIS MORNING AND MOVING NORTHEASTWARD DURING THE DAY. THIS WILL PUSH
A COLD FRONT TOWARD NORTHEAST AR / MO BOOTHEEL FROM THE NORTHWEST BY
LATE IN THE DAY. THIS MEANS THAT WE CAN EXPECT WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS TODAY AS WE RETURN TO AN UNUSUAL WEATHER PATTERN FOR
SUMMER. THE THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER APPEARS LOW AS CLOUDS AND RAIN
WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES DOWN. FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES ARE VERY
HIGH SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT FLOODING PROBLEMS.

THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN MOSTLY WESTERLY THE NEXT FEW DAYS
WITH HEIGHTS BELOW NORMAL. AS A RESULT...THE COLD FRONT IS FORECAST
TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH BY SATURDAY...
PROBABLY WEST TO EAST FROM EAST-CENTRAL AR AND ALONG THE TN / MS
BORDER. THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS / THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MAINLY
ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE FRONT SATURDAY. WILL KEEP AREAS FROM

AN END TO THE DRY WEATHER OVER THE MIDSOUTH IS NEAR. CURRENTLY...A 
STRONG SHORTWAVE IS PRODUCING NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS AND THE ARKLATEX. MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
ON BRINGING THIS STRONG 500MB SHORTWAVE AND COLD FRONT INTO THE 
MIDSOUTH BY TOMORROW MORNING. A SFC LOW WILL FORM ALONG THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IN SOUTHWEST MISSOURI FRIDAY MORNING...MOVING EAST ALONG 
THE FRONT. THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE GFS AND ETA OVER HOW 
STRONG THIS FRONTAL LOW WILL BE. PREFER TO LEAN TOWARD ETA AS GFS 
HAS HAD A HABIT OF OVERDOING SUCH LOWS. EITHER WAY...THE END RESULT 
IS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. INTRODUCED CHANCE POPS IN THE WESTERN 
ZONES OVERNIGHT. POPS BECOME CATEGORICAL ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA 
TOMORROW...WITH LIKELY POPS OVER THE FAR EAST ZONES AS THE BEST 
DYNAMICS STAY TO THE NORTH AND WEST WITH THE SHORTWAVE. HEAVY RAIN 
IS A DEFINITE POSSIBILITY AS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL NEAR 2 
INCHES AND LIFTED INDICES ARE AROUND -3. HIGHS WILL BE HELD DOWN 
TOMORROW DUE TO THE ABUNDANT CLOUDS AND RAIN.

RAIN WILL LINGER INTO SATURDAY AS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLOWLY SAGS 
SOUTH. BEST CHANCES OF RAIN ON SATURDAY WILL OCCUR OVER THE NORTH 
MISSISSIPPI ZONES. A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE HAS OCCURRED IN TODAYS MODEL 
RUNS AS NEITHER THE ETA OR GFS NOW BRING THE FRONT COMPLETELY 
THROUGH THE CWA. FRONT WILL LIKELY STALL OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI AS 
THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES PARALLEL TO THE FRONT. GFS BRINGS A 
STRONG VORTICITY MAX ACROSS NORTH MS ON SUNDAY...DEVELOPING A SFC 
LOW ALONG THE STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY. NOT GOING WITH THIS 
SOLUTION...DUE TO LIKELY CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK IN THE GFS. WILL KEEP 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ON SUNDAY FOR THE FAR SOUTH MS ZONES TO ACCOUNT 
FOR THE STALLED BOUNDARY. SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE 
NORTHERN ZONES THROUGH MONDAY.

IN THE EXTENDED...FAST ZONAL FLOW RESUMES BY MONDAY. HARD TO 
RECOGNIZE ANY SMALL DISTURBANCES THAT MIGHT MOVE THROUGH THE 
WESTERLIES...THEREFORE HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN TUESDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY. THIS ALSO COINCIDES WELL WITH THE RETURN OF DEEPER 
BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE. LONG RANGE ENSEMBLES IN FAIRLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT AT BUILDING A DEEP WEST COAST TROUGH AND EAST COAST RIDGE. 
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT WILL DEFINITELY FEEL MORE LIKE SUMMER BY WEEKS

A SPLIT FLOW PATTERN WILL DOMINATE THE COUNTRY EAST OF THE ROCKYS FOR
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. A BROAD TROF WILL DOMINATE THE NORTH AND EAST
WITH A WEAK RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN GULF EXTENDING NORTHWARD TO THE
SOUTHEASTERN STATES. A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES ROTATING AROUND THE TROF
WILL DIVE INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND SOUTHEASTERN STATES
FRIDAY AND THIS WEEKEND. THE TROF WILL LIFT OUT TO THE EAST FOLLOWED
BY A BROAD RIDGE OVER THE COUNTRY NEXT MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES
WILL REMAIN STATIONARY AND CAUSE DRY BUT WARMER AND MORE HUMID
WEATHER OVER THE MID SOUTH TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY. HOWEVER THE
INCREASED HUMIDITY TOGETHER WITH AFTERNOON HEATING WILL CAUSE
ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION THURSDAY. A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE
MID SOUTH FRIDAY AND MOVE ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY. THE RESULT WILL
BE INCREASED CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HIGH PRESSURE
BEHIND THE FRONT WILL BRING DRIER WEATHER SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THAT BROUGHT THE UNSEASONABLY COOL AIRMASS
TO THE MIDSOUTH THIS PAST WEEKEND CONTINUES TO LIFT OUT AND THE
UPPER FLOW WILL CONTINUE TRANSITIONING TO A MORE ZONAL FLOW THROUGH
THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. MEANWHILE AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE
CENTERED OVER THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEYS THIS AFTERNOON
WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST...AND ALLOW THE LOW LEVEL FLOW TO RETURN
TO A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION ON TUESDAY. 850 MB TEMPS WILL WARM
THROUGH THE DAY AND THIS ALONG WITH SOME UPPER LEVEL HEIGHT RISES...
WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO MODERATE FURTHER ON TUESDAY (MID TO
UPPER 80S). MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES AND AN INCREASE IN
HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AS
LOWER LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW CONTINUES.

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS PROGGED TO MOVE FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS
STATES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS UPPER LEVEL
FEATURE WILL HELP TO PUSH A COLD FRONT SOUTHEAST TO A POSITION NEAR
THE OHIO RIVER BEFORE STALLING OUT AND DISSIPATING. THESE WEATHER
FEATURES SHOULD STAY FAR ENOUGH TO OUR NORTH TO PREVENT PRECIP.
ONLY EXPECTING SOME CLOUD COVER WITH THIS SYSTEM.

A STRONGER SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL HELP TO RECARVE THE LONGWAVE TROUGH
OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION AND WILL SEND A COLD FRONT SOUTH INTO
THE AREA ON FRIDAY. AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE...SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR THE END OF THE WEEK AND INTO THE
WEEKEND. ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON...MAINLY A
RESULT OF DAYTIME HEATING AND AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE FROM THE

ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY IN STORE FOR THE MIDSOUTH...WITH PLENTY OF
SUNSHINE AND STILL BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND HUMIDITIES.

MORNING SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS CENTERED
OVER THE MIDWEST AND EXTENDS DOWN OVER OUR REGION. UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH CONTINUING TO LIFT OUT TODAY...LEAVING REGION IN MORE OF A
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. SHORTWAVE DISTURBANCE OVER KANSAS HAS SPREAD
CLOUD COVER INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. THIS DISTURBANCE
SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EAST INTO A MORE CONFLUENT
UPPER FLOW. EXPECTING MOST OF THE LOWER TO MID LEVEL CLOUDS TO
REMAIN TO THE WEST TODAY WITH ONLY SOME THIN CIRRUS SPREADING EAST
ACROSS MAINLY SOUTHERN SECTIONS THIS AFTERNOON IN ASSOCIATION WITH
AN UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK.

AS FOR CU DEVELOPMENT...LOOKING AT 12Z SOUNDINGS FROM BOTH LZK AND
OHX SHOWING SOME LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FROM LZK WITH A FAIRLY
DRY SOUNDING FROM OHX. THINK THAT WITH SFC HIGH IN PLACE AND
LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL LIMIT OVERALL COVERAGE OF CU
DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO WARM TO
CURRENT FORECAST HIGHS. WINDS LOOK TO BE OK AS WELL...SO NOT PLANNING
ANY UPDATES TO THE CURRENT FORECAST...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH CU
DEVELOPMENT AND SEE IF THIS AFFECTS THE AFTERNOON MAXIMUMS. MAY HAVE
TO UPDATE TO LOWER MAX TEMPS AND GO PARTLY CLOUDY SKY WORDING IF MORE
CU DEVELOPS THEN EXPECTED.


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FROM 300 AM...

A SURFACE HIGH OVER THE OH AND MS VALLEYS WILL CONTINUE TO SLIP TO
THE SE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. MEANWHILE THE UPPER PATTERN WILL
SHIFT TO A MORE ZONAL FLOW WITH A FLAT RIDGE OVER THE AREA BY MID
WEEK. THIS TRANSITION WILL BRING A RETURN TO MORE SUMMER LIKE
WEATHER WITH TEMPS IN THE LOWER 90S BY WED AND THU AND DEWPOINTS
BACK IN THE MID/UPPER 60S. EXPECT PRECIP CHANCE TO INCREASE BY THE
END OF THE WEEK AN UPPER TROF MOVES ACRS THE SRN PLAINS THU/FRI AND
A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THIS WEEKEND.

EXPECT A GOOD DEAL OF SUNSHINE TODAY. A LITTLE DRIER IN THE LOW
LEVELS WITH CU RULE SHOWING LITTLE DEVELOPMENT. TEMPS WL CLIMB INTO
THE MID 80S. ANOTHER COOL ONE IN STORE WITH SFC HIGH PRESSURE RIGHT
OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. SOME INCREASE IN 1000-500 MB MOISTURE OVER
WESTERN HALF BUT EASTERN AREAS SHOULD BE FAIRLY CLOUD FREE. MKL AND
TUP WL FALL INTO THE 50S AND THREATEN RECORDS ONCE AGAIN.

WARMUP CONTINUES TUE AS 850 MB TEMPS WL CLIMB TO +17C WITH SFC
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S. SFC HIGH SHIFTS TO THE SE RESULTING IN
LIGHT SOUTH WINDS AND HIGHER DEWPOINTS SO EXPECT TUE NIGHT TO BE A
LITTLE MORE MILD...MORE 60S AND LESS 50S.

WED/THU EXPECT TEMPS IN AROUND THE 90 DEGREES MARK WITH 850 TEMPS OF
18C. SFC DEWPOINTS WL APPROACH THE 70 MARK AS WELL. A LITTLE TOUCH
OF SUMMER AFTER THE RECENT FALL LIKE WEATHER. WED WL BE DRY WITH
WEAK UPPER RIDGE ACRS THE AREA. ON THU A COLD FRONT STALLS TO THE

BY FRI AIRMASS IS SUFFICIENTLY MOIST WITH SEVERAL SHORTWAVES MOVING

247 PM CDT SUN AUG 15 2004

.DISCUSSION...

MIDSOUTH WEATHER IS DOMINATED BY SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
WEST-CENTRAL ILLINOIS. A WEAK UPPER AIR DISTURBANCE THAT BROUGHT 
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES TO EAST ARKANSAS THIS MORNING HAS WEAKENED AND 
ASSOCIATED CLOUD COVER HAS MIXED OUT INTO AFTERNOON CUMULUS. CIRRUS 
FROM CONVECTION OVER OKLAHOMA IS MOVING OVER ARKANSAS AND WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE REGION TONIGHT. UPPER AIR PATTERN CONSISTS OF A HIGH 
AMPLITUDE LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY WITH 
A RIDGE OVER THE WEST. THIS PATTERN HAS BEEN RELAXING AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO DO SO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
GRADUAL WARMING TREND WITH THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER NOT EXPECTED UNTIL 
END WEEK. 

TONIGHT...WITH PROXIMITY OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION AND JUST 
SOME CIRRUS DRIFTING THROUGH SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER COOL NIGHT WITH 
POTENTIAL RECORD BREAKING TEMPS AT JACKSON TN AND TUPELO. THE AIR 
MASS HAS BEEN GRADUALLY MODIFYING OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND 
COMBINED WITH THE CIRRUS...OVERNIGHT LOWS SHOULDNT BE AS COLD AS THE 
PREVIOUS RECORD SETTING NIGHTS. 

850 TEMPS WILL BE RISING A COUPLE DEGREES BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY. 
SO MID TO UPPER 80S POSSIBLE ON TUESDAY WITH TEMPS AROUND 90 ON 
WEDNESDAY. A SHORTWAVE WILL SKIRT JUST NORTH OF THE REGION TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. MODELS PAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE HINTED ON AND 
OFF AT A SHOT OF A RAIN SHOWER MAINLY NEAR THE KENTUCKY BORDER. HAVE 
KEPT DRY FORECAST GOING WITH SFC FRONT EXPECTED TO STAY NORTH OF THE 
REGION AND DRY AIR ALREADY IN PLACE. HAVE REMOVED MENTION OF RAIN 
THU/THU NIGHT WITH NEXT SYSTEM SLOWING IN THE 06Z AND 12Z RUNS. 
FURTHERMORE...850-500MB RH RATHER LOW SO THINK THAT AFTERNOON HEAT 
OF THE DAY TSTRMS RATHER UNLIKELY. CLOSED LOW ARRIVES FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND MOVES THROUGH THE REGION BY SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS LOOKS 
TO BRING THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN TO THE AREA. MODELS HAVE BEEN 
RATHER CONSISTENT IN THE SYSTEM...ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN SLOWING 
ITS ARRIVAL. NO REAL SURGES OF COLD/WARM AIR FORESEEN...SO LOOKS 
LIKE TEMPS AT OR PERHAPS JUST BELOW NORMAL FOR THE LATTER PORTION OF

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

247 PM CDT SUN AUG 15 2004

.DISCUSSION...

MIDSOUTH WEATHER IS DOMINATED BY SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
WEST-CENTRAL ILLINOIS. A WEAK UPPER AIR DISTURBANCE THAT BROUGHT 
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES TO EAST ARKANSAS THIS MORNING HAS WEAKENED AND 
ASSOCIATED CLOUD COVER HAS MIXED OUT INTO AFTERNOON CUMULUS. CIRRUS 
FROM CONVECTION OVER OKLAHOMA IS MOVING OVER ARKANSAS AND WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE REGION TONIGHT. UPPER AIR PATTERN CONSISTS OF A HIGH 
AMPLITUDE LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY WITH 
A RIDGE OVER THE WEST. THIS PATTERN HAS BEEN RELAXING AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO DO SO OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
GRADUAL WARMING TREND WITH THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER NOT EXPECTED UNTIL 
END WEEK. 

TONIGHT...WITH PROXIMITY OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION AND JUST 
SOME CIRRUS DRIFTING THROUGH SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER COOL NIGHT WITH 
POTENTIAL RECORD BREAKING TEMPS AT JACKSON TN AND TUPELO. THE AIR 
MASS HAS BEEN GRADUALLY MODIFYING OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS AND 
COMBINED WITH THE CIRRUS...OVERNIGHT LOWS SHOULDNT BE AS COLD AS THE 
PREVIOUS RECORD SETTING NIGHTS. 

850 TEMPS WILL BE RISING A COUPLE DEGREES BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY. 
SO MID TO UPPER 80S POSSIBLE ON TUESDAY WITH TEMPS AROUND 90 ON 
WEDNESDAY. A SHORTWAVE WILL SKIRT JUST NORTH OF THE REGION TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. MODELS PAST COUPLE OF DAYS HAVE HINTED ON AND 
OFF AT A SHOT OF A RAIN SHOWER MAINLY NEAR THE KENTUCKY BORDER. HAVE 
KEPT DRY FORECAST GOING WITH SFC FRONT EXPECTED TO STAY NORTH OF THE 
REGION AND DRY AIR ALREADY IN PLACE. HAVE REMOVED MENTION OF RAIN 
THU/THU NIGHT WITH NEXT SYSTEM SLOWING IN THE 06Z AND 12Z RUNS. 
FURTHERMORE...850-500MB RH RATHER LOW SO THINK THAT AFTERNOON HEAT 
OF THE DAY TSTRMS RATHER UNLIKELY. CLOSED LOW ARRIVES FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND MOVES THROUGH THE REGION BY SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS LOOKS 
TO BRING THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN TO THE AREA. MODELS HAVE BEEN 
RATHER CONSISTENT IN THE SYSTEM...ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE BEEN SLOWING 
ITS ARRIVAL. NO REAL SURGES OF COLD/WARM AIR FORESEEN...SO LOOKS 
LIKE TEMPS AT OR PERHAPS JUST BELOW NORMAL FOR THE LATTER PORTION OF 
THE WEEK.

RADIATIONAL COOLING IS TAKING PLACE OVER OUR CWA BUT THE AIRMASS IS

HIGH PRESSURE IS POSITIONED OVER THE REGION. A WEAKENING UPPER 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS MOVING OVER SOUTHWEST MISSOURI TODAY AND THIS 
HAS RESULTED IN A FEW SHOWERS THERE. A HIGH AMPLITUDE UPPER AIR 
PATTERN IS ANALYZED AT 12Z WITH A RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN US AND A 
LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN US. THE PATTERN WILL RELAX SOMEWHAT 
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...WITH THE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTING MORE TOWARDS 
THE  WEST COAST LEAVING THE MIDDLE AND EASTERN US IN NORTHWEST FLOW. 

TONIGHT...EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER OVER SOUTHERN MISSOURI IS 
ENCOUNTERING A GOOD DEAL OF DRY AIR AS IT TRIES TO SLIDE INTO THE 
AREA. SOLAR HEATING IS HELPING TO CREATE MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS AS 
THIS AREA OF CLOUD COVER MOVES INTO EAST ARKANSAS...HOWEVER EXPECT 
THAT AS THE SUN GOES DOWN THE CLOUDS SHOULD BREAK UP AND LEAVE 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT. WIND FIELDS WILL ONCE AGAIN RELAX WITH 
LOW DEW POINTS. SO THE OVERALL SCENARIO HASNT CHANGED MUCH FROM THE 
PAST COUPLE OF NIGHTS. CLEARING SKIES/LIGHT WINDS AND LOW DEW POINTS 
SHOULD RESULT IN NEAR RECORD LOW TEMPS AREAWIDE ONCE AGAIN. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN FIXED OVER THE REGION ON SUNDAY. 
SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STILL IN PLACE FOR AFTERNOON CUMULUS 
DEVELOPMENT. 850 TEMPS RISE TO AROUND +11 TOMORROW AS THE UPPER 
TROUGH LIFTS OUT OF THE AREA. THIS SUPPORTS MAX TEMPS IN THE LOWER 
80S. ALTHOUGH AIR MASS IS MODIFYING...NEAR RECORD LOWS WILL ONCE 
AGAIN BE POSSIBLE TOMORROW NIGHT AT JACKSON TN AND TUPELO.

850 TEMPS RISE A COUPLE MORE DEGREES ON MONDAY...SUPPORTING TEMPS IN 
THE MID 80S...STILL HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL. ON MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY...A WEAK UPPER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE DOWN FROM THE NORTHWEST. 
GFS INDICATES NO RAIN FROM THIS SYSTEM...WHILE ETA DOES SHOW SOME 
QPF...GIVEN THE DRY AIR IN PLACE AND THE FACT THAT BOTH MODELS SHOW 
THAT NO STRONG LOW LEVEL FRONT MOVING THROUGH (PERHAPS A WEAK WARM 
FRONT) HAVE DECIDED TO CONTINUE THE DRY FORECAST WITH GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND.

THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN REMAINS HIGHLY AMPLIFIED THIS AFTERNOON WITH
A DEEP UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH ANCHORED OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
THIS HAS ALLOWED FOR THE UNSEASONABLY COOL WEATHER TO PERSIST OVER
THE FORECAST AREA AGAIN TODAY WITH TEMPS STRUGGLING TO RECOVER INTO
THE LOW TO MID 70S THIS AFTERNOON. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN IN
PLACE OVER THE AREA INTO SUNDAY WITH UNUSUALLY LOW HEIGHTS. THIS
MEANS RECORD LOW TEMPERATURES AT ALL OF THE MAJOR CLIMATOLOGICAL
SITES SHOULD BE BROKEN AGAIN TONIGHT...WITH MKL APPROACHING ITS
MONTHLY RECORD MINIMUM FOR AUGUST...WHICH WAS SET LAST NIGHT AT 47
DEGREES. AFTER TONIGHTS RECORD LOW TEMPS...EXPECT TEMPS TO BEGIN TO
MODIFY OVER THE WEEKEND...WITH TEMPS GAINING 3-5 DEGREES PER DAY
THROUGH SUNDAY...AS UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS BEGIN RISING. AT THE
SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST FROM A POSITION OVER
THE MIDDLE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO THE MIDWEST THROUGH THE WEEKEND.
THIS WILL KEEP WEATHER CONDITIONS DRY THROUGH SUNDAY. AS HEIGHTS
BEGIN TO RISE AND THE ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES TO BECOME DRIER...THERE
SHOULD BE LESS IN THE WAY OF CU AND STRATOCU DEVELOPMENT...SO WENT
MOSTLY SUNNY ON SAT. AND SUN. AFTERNOONS WITH CLEAR NIGHTS
CONTINUING.

THE DEEP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO LIFT OUT SUNDAY EVENING
INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK. THE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH
WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE TO THE EAST COAST...ALLOWING FOR A RETURN OF
SOUTHERLY FLOW ON MONDAY. AS THE PATTERN CONTINUES TO TRANSITION TO
A MORE ZONAL FLOW...BOTH TEMPS AND HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL CONTINUE TO
MODERATE FROM SUNDAY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...WITH TEMPS
RETURNING A BIT CLOSER TO NORMAL NEXT WEEK (MID TO UPPER 80S).

A WEAK UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL ATTEMPT TO RE-CARVE THE
EASTERN LONGWAVE TROUGH ON TUESDAY...THAT WILL SEND A WEAK COLD
FRONT SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONT WILL STALL TO
OUR NORTH...KEEPING CONDITIONS DRY AND WARMER. THIS SHORTWAVE WILL
HELP TO PUT THE REGION BACK UNDER NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. A MORE

THURSDAY...HELPING TO PUSH A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH
THURSDAY AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY. AHEAD OF THIS FRONT EXPECTING THE

.DISCUSSION...

HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL PATTERN NOW IN PLACE ACROSS THE
LOWER 48 STATES THIS AFTERNOON. A LARGE AND UNSEASONABLY DEEP TROUGH
IS NOW ENTRENCHED ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WITH UPPER
RIDGING BUILDING OVER THE WEST. THIS LARGE TROUGH OVER THE EAST WILL
KEEP ALL OF THE TROPICAL SYSTEMS WELL TO OUR EAST ALONG THE EASTERN
SEABOARD WITH AN UNUSUALLY COOL AND DRY AIRMASS SPILLING INTO OUR
AREA. TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON HAVE REMAINED 15-20 DEGREES BELOW
NORMAL...MOSTLY IN THE LOW TO MID 70S...WITH DEWPOINTS ONLY IN THE
UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. FEELS MUCH MORE LIKE FALL RATHER THAN AUGUST

UPPER LEVEL PATTERN IS FORECAST TO REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE
WEEKEND...WITH A DEEP TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED
STATES AND UNSEASONABLY LOW HEIGHTS. THIS WILL KEEP WEATHER
CONDITIONS DRY INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK WITH ONLY A SLOW
MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES...GETTING BACK CLOSER TO NORMAL BY TUESDAY
AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK (UPPER 80S). CU CLOUDS ARE LIKELY
TO DEVELOP AGAIN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
WILL LINGER AROUND ALONG WITH STEEP LAPSE RATES ASSOCIATED WITH COLD
AIR ALOFT.

ANOTHER BIG STORY WILL BE COLD OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES FOR
TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. TONIGHTS LOW TEMPERATURES WILL
APPROACH RECORD LOWS...BUT MAY BE HELD UP SOMEWHAT TONIGHT AS WINDS
WILL NOT GO CALM AND SOME CLOUD COVER MAY DEVELOP AHEAD OF AN UPPER
LEVEL SHORTWAVE ROTATING THROUGH THE BASE OF THE MEAN TROUGH. ON
FRIDAY AND AGAIN ON SATURDAY NIGHTS...RECORD TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN
JEOPARDY OF FALLING...WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE GETTING CLOSER AND
SKIES GOING CLEAR AND WINDS CALM. HAVE LISTED THE RECORD TEMPERATURES
FOR THE MAJOR CLIMATOLOGICAL SITES.

THE NEXT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE THURSDAY OF
NEXT WEEK. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE INDICATING ANOTHER STRONG COLD

.DISCUSSION...

HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL PATTERN NOW IN PLACE ACROSS THE
LOWER 48 STATES THIS AFTERNOON. A LARGE AND UNSEASONABLY DEEP TROUGH
IS NOW ENTRENCHED ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WITH UPPER
RIDGING BUILDING OVER THE WEST. THIS LARGE TROUGH OVER THE EAST WILL
KEEP ALL OF THE TROPICAL SYSTEMS WELL TO OUR EAST ALONG THE EASTERN
SEABOARD WITH AN UNUSUALLY COOL AND DRY AIRMASS SPILLING INTO OUR
AREA. TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON HAVE REMAINED 15-20 DEGREES BELOW
NORMAL...MOSTLY IN THE LOW TO MID 70S...WITH DEWPOINTS ONLY IN THE
UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. FEELS MUCH MORE LIKE FALL RATHER THAN AUGUST

UPPER LEVEL PATTERN IS FORECAST TO REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE
WEEKEND...WITH A DEEP TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED
STATES AND UNSEASONABLY LOW HEIGHTS. THIS WILL KEEP WEATHER
CONDITIONS DRY INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK WITH ONLY A SLOW
MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES...GETTING BACK CLOSER TO NORMAL BY TUESDAY
AND WEDNESDAY OF NEXT WEEK (UPPER 80S). CU CLOUDS ARE LIKELY
TO DEVELOP AGAIN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
WILL LINGER AROUND ALONG WITH STEEP LAPSE RATES ASSOCIATED WITH COLD
AIR ALOFT.

ANOTHER BIG STORY WILL BE COLD OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES FOR
TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. TONIGHTS LOW TEMPERATURES WILL
APPROACH RECORD LOWS...BUT MAY BE HELD UP SOMEWHAT TONIGHT AS WINDS
WILL NOT GO CALM AND SOME CLOUD COVER MAY DEVELOP AHEAD OF AN UPPER
LEVEL SHORTWAVE ROTATING THROUGH THE BASE OF THE MEAN TROUGH. ON
FRIDAY AND AGAIN ON SATURDAY NIGHTS...RECORD TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN
JEOPARDY OF FALLING...WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE GETTING CLOSER AND
SKIES GOING CLEAR AND WINDS CALM. HAVE LISTED THE RECORD TEMPERATURES
FOR THE MAJOR CLIMATOLOGICAL SITES.

THE NEXT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE THURSDAY OF
NEXT WEEK. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE INDICATING ANOTHER STRONG COLD
FRONT PASSING THROUGH THE AREA. IT APPEARS AT LEAST AT THIS TIME
THAT WE MAY SEE ANOTHER PERIOD OF UNSEASONABLY COOL AND DRY WEATHER
AGAIN FOR NEXT WEEKEND. THIS IS VERY FAR OUT IN THE FORECAST PERIOD
SO TIMING ADJUSTMENTS ON FRONTAL PASSAGE MAY CHANGE.

A SFC HIGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE OH VLY TODAY PROVIDING PLENTY OF 
SUNSHINE ALONG WITH AN ABNORMALLY COOLER AND DRIER AIRMASS. CURRENT 
FORECAST IS ON TRACK FOR TODAY.

THE HIGH OVER OH VLY MOVES TO NC BY SUNDAY CAUSING VEERING OF WINDS 
TO THE SE AND SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPS. A MESOHIGH DEVELOPS OVER ERN AR 
SUN NITE CAUSING A CONTINUATION OF LIGHT WINDS AT NIGHT. THE TWO 
HIGHS MERGE AS ONE OVER THE SE STATES LATER MONDAY...SO TEMPS/DWPTS 
WILL BE A FEW NOTCHES HIGHER THAN SUNDAY WITH A MORE SRLY WIND FLOW.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE CWA FROM THE NW TUE BEFORE STALLING

IT CERTAINLY DOES NOT FEEL LIKE EARLY AUGUST ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH. 
MID TO UPPER 50 DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN USHERED IN ON NE WINDS AROUND 
SFC HIGH CENTERED OVER THE MIDWEST. FOR TONIGHT...DYR ATMOSPHERIC 
LAYER...CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL SET THE STAGE FOR OPTIMAL 
RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT...RECORD LOWS FOR 
TONIGHT ARE IN JEOPARDY IN MEMPHIS (61)...JACKSON (57)...AND TUPELO 
(59). CANNOT RULE OUT A FEW THIN CIRRUS MOVING UP AND OVER THE RIDGE 
INTO NE AR...BUT THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT MIN TEMPS TONIGHT.

DEEP NW FLOW WILL TURN MORE WNW OVER THE WEEKEND WITH SFC HIGH 
SHIFTING FURTHER EAST. THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO MODERATE A 
FEW DEGREES EACH DAY. IT WILL STILL FEEL FAIRLY PLEASANT WITH 
DEWPOINTS REMAINING LOW.

ETA/GFS/ECMWF IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON REAMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH ACROSS 
THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY...PUSHING ANOTHER FRONT THROUGH THE 
MIDSOUTH EARLY TUESDAY. MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE FRONT LOOKS LIMITED 
DUE TO A LACK OF A PROLONGED RETURN FLOW...THEREFORE WILL KEEP LOW 
CHANCE POPS. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS UPPER JET 
ENERGY MOVES JUST NORTH OF THE AREA AND FRONTAL BOUNDARY STALLS 
SOUTH OF THE CWA. 

DEEP NW FLOW RESUMES LATE IN THE WEEK...ALLOWING HIGH PRESSURE TO

HOWEVER...SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS FROM SOUTHERN IL INTO SOUTHEASTERN 
MO AND EXTREME NORTHERN AR. NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
OCCURRING ALONG AND AHEAD OF THIS SURFACE TROUGH. THESE STORMS ARE 
PRESENTLY AFFECTING PARTS OF NORTHEASTERN AR. A FEW STORMS HAVE BEEN 
STRONG...BUT REMAINED BELOW SEVERE LIMITS IN OUR FORECAST AREA. 00Z 
SOUNDING DATA CONTINUES TO INDICATE A WEAK CAP OVER THE MIDSOUTH 
WITH TEMPERATURES QUITE WARM ALOFT...OHX AND LZK 00Z SOUNDINGS SHOW 
500 MB TEMPERATURES OF MINUS 3 DEGREES C. SPC HAS REMOVED THE SLIGHT 
RISK FROM ANY PART OF OUR FORECAST AREA FOR TONIGHT. WILL UPDATE THE 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO REMOVE THE THREAT OF SEVERE. A FEW 
STORMS STILL COULD BE STRONG...PARTICULARLY AS AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. THIS SHORT WAVE WILL AID TO 
DECREASE THE CAP...BUT ON THE OTHER HAND...WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING THE ATMOSPHERE WILL GRADUALLY STABILIZE.

.UPDATE...
ACTUAL COLD FRONT IS STILL WELL TO OUR NORTH...FROM ABOUT CENTRAL IL 
INTO NORTHERN MO WHERE THE DEWPOINTS BEGIN TO DROP OFF INTO THE 60S. 
HOWEVER...SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDS FROM SOUTHERN IL INTO SOUTHEASTERN 
MO AND EXTREME NORTHERN AR. NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
OCCURRING ALONG AND AHEAD OF THIS SURFACE TROUGH. THESE STORMS ARE 
PRESENTLY AFFECTING PARTS OF NORTHEASTERN AR. A FEW STORMS HAVE BEEN 
STRONG...BUT REMAINED BELOW SEVERE LIMITS IN OUR FORECAST AREA. 00Z 
SOUNDING DATA CONTINUES TO INDICATE A WEAK CAP OVER THE MIDSOUTH 
WITH TEMPERATURES QUITE WARM ALOFT...OHX AND LZK 00Z SOUNDINGS SHOW 
500 MB TEMPERATURES OF MINUS 3 DEGREES C. SPC HAS REMOVED THE SLIGHT 
RISK FROM ANY PART OF OUR FORECAST AREA FOR TONIGHT. WILL UPDATE THE 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO REMOVE THE THREAT OF SEVERE. A FEW 
STORMS STILL COULD BE STRONG...PARTICULARLY AS AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. THIS SHORT WAVE WILL AID TO 
DECREASE THE CAP...BUT ON THE OTHER HAND...WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING THE ATMOSPHERE WILL GRADUALLY STABILIZE. 

UPDATED FORECAST/GRIDS EARLIER TO INCREASE POPS SOME THIS EVENING 
FROM NORTHEASTERN AR INTO NORTHWEST TN. ALSO...MADE SOME CHANGES TO 
THE WIND FOR TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...CURRENT FORECAST IS ON 
TRACK...WILL NEED TO UPDATE AND FRESHEN ZONE WORDING LATE THIS

EXPECT CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT AS UPPER RIDGE AXIS DOMINATES THE 
PATTERN. EXPECT SOME HAZE AND THEN TYPICAL PATCHY FOG TOWARD 
MORNING. LOWS WILL CONT TO MODERATE WITH MOST LOCATIONS REMAINING 
ABOVE THE 70 DEGREE MARK. 

ON WEDNESDAY A MAJOR PATTERN SHIFT BEGINS. A STRONG SHORTWAVE MOVES 
INTO THE OH VALLEY WITH A COLD FRONT SWEEPING SOUTH TO SRN MO BY 
LATE IN THE DAY. 850 MB TEMPS OF +22C TO +23C WITH PLENTY OF 
SUNSHINE AND GOOD MIXING WL RESULT IN A HOT DAY. TEMPS WL REACH THE

EVERYONE. HAVE ADDED SMALL POPS TO NE AR/MO BOOTHEEL FOR WED AFTN 
SINCE COLD FRONT IS MOVING EVEN QUICKER THIS RUN. MODELS IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THIS FEATURE.

AN UPPER TROF OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL FLATTEN OUT AS IT
SLIDES EASTWARD TO THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT AND
SUNDAY. A SHORT WAVE WILL BREAK OFF THE TROF OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN
STATES AS AN UPPER HIGH IN THE SOUTHWEST STRENGTHENS. THE WAVE WILL
ELONGATE AND DRIFT SLOWLY EASTWARD TO THE SOUTHEAST COAST BY
WEDNESDAY. THE HIGH WILL SPREAD EASTWARD ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY TO THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. FROM
THURSDAY ON THE HIGH RETROGRADES BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST AS SHORT WAVES
CARVE A DEEP TROF IN THE EAST CREATING A VERY AMPLIFIED PATTERN FOR
THIS TIME OF YEAR.

AT THE SURFACE A COLD FRONT WILL MAKE ITS WAY OUT OF THE MID SOUTH
TONIGHT. A HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO
VALLEYS WILL SPREAD DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION. SCATTERED SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LINGER BEHIND THE FRONT SOUTHEAST PORTIONS
THIS EVENING. THE HIGH WILL SAG SLOWLY SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN

19Z SFC MAP PLACES A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER EAST CENTRAL MISSOURI 
WITH A COOL FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS. THIS SYSTEM IS ASSOCIATED WITH A SLOW MOVING 
UPPER SHORTWAVE THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT AND 
SATURDAY. CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THE FRONT. ENOUGH 
DESTABILIZATION HAS OCCURRED TODAY THAT THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK THAT 
SOME OF THE STORMS MAY BE SEVERE WITH SOME MICROBURST POTENTIAL 
POSSIBLE.

TONIGHT...SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD WITH BETTER RAIN 
CHANCES SHIFTING EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY 00Z. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS AND GUIDANCE INDICATING THAT SOME FOG MAY DEVELOP 
OVERNIGHT AND TOMORROW MORNING ACROSS THE REGION. CONDITIONS ARE NOT 
AS IDEAL FOR WIDESPREAD FOG FORMATION WITH CLOUD LINGERING OVER MUCH 
OF THE AREA TONIGHT. HOWEVER...WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND BOUNDARY 
LAYER WILL BE VERY MOIST WITH AFTERNOON/EVENING RAINFALL. 

TOMORROW...SHORTWAVE TROUGH SLOWLY MOVES THROUGH NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI AND EXPECT CONVECTION TO ONCE AGAIN DEVELOP DURING THE 
MORNING IN THAT AREA AND MOVE EASTWARD ALABAMA DURING THE DAY. 850 
TEMPS AROUND +18 WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES BEHIND BEHIND THE 
SHORTWAVE SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE INTO THE UPPER 80S TO AROUND 
90. ONCE AGAIN FOG FORMATION POSSIBLE ACROSS PORTIONS OF WEST TN 
INTO NORTHEAST MS TOMORROW NIGHT INTO EARLY SUNDAY WITH LIGHT 
WINDS...CLEARING SKIES AND MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER IN PLACE. IN THE 
DELTA AND NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...DRYING OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER DURING 
THE DAY SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT ON SATURDAY TO PREVENT ANY SIGNIFICANT 
FOG DEVELOPMENT. 

ON SUNDAY...WEAKENING SHORTWAVE WILL EXTEND FROM MIDDLE TN THROUGH 
NORTHWEST ALABAMA INTO CENTRAL MS. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS IN MAINLY SOUTH OF TUPELO DUE TO UNCERTAINTY OF WHERE 
THE SHORTWAVE WILL BE. ATMOSPHERE BEHIND THE SHORTWAVE WILL CONSIST 
OF RATHER STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES ALONG WITH GOOD LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE. HOWEVER A GOOD MID LEVEL CAP WIL BE IN PLACE SO AFTERNOON 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT IS UNLIKELY. OTHERWISE...850 TEMPS ARE A 
COUPLE DEGREES WARMER TRANSLATING INTO HIGHS IN THE LOW 90S. 

CHANGE IN THE FORECAST NOW FOR EARLY TO MID WEEK WITH GFS AND ETA 
TAKING THE TROPICAL SYSTEM OVER THE EASTERN GULF AND MOVING IT MORE 
IN THE DIRECTION OF THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. THIS SETUP SHOULD PLACE 
THE ENTIRE REGION FAR ENOUGH WEST FROM BEING DIRECTLY AFFECTED. NO 
OBVIOUS SIGNIFICANT SYSTEMS WILL IMPACT THE REGION NEXT WEEK. 
HOWEVER THE HEAT WILL BE A CONCERN WITH GFS SHOWING 850 TEMPS 
CLIMBING TO +21 ON TUESDAY AND +23 ON WEDNESDAY. WITH FULL 
SUN...UPPER 90S CERTAINLY POSSIBLE WITH HEAT INDICIES OVER 105

.PREV DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 309 PM...

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS PRESENT OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THIS 
AFTERNOON. THIS SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY MOVE EASTWARD TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. 
THE SYSTEM IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AND THERE IS A GOOD 
DEAL OF LOW AND MID LEVEL DRY AIR OVER THE MIDSOUTH. AS A RESULT 
RAIN SHOULD HOLD OFF OVER MOST OF THE AREA UNTIL TOMORROW AFTERNOON. 
WILL BEGIN WITH LOW CHANCES OF RAIN OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS TONIGHT. 
MODELS SHOWING THE PRIMARY MOISTURE AXIS GRADUALLY SHIFTING EASTWARD 
DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. THIS MAIN AXIS SHOULD MOVE INTO EAST 
ARKANSAS DURING THE MORNING AND INTO NORTHWEST MS AND WEST TN INTO 
THE AFTERNOON. CLOUD COVER AND MOISTURE RETURN SHOULD KEEP TEMPS UP 
TONIGHT. TEMPS OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS SHOULD BE HELD IN THE LOW TO 
MID 80S DUE TO MORE CLOUDS AND BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN. 
ELSEWHERE...CLOUDS AND THREAT FOR RAIN SHOULD KEEP TEMPS IN THE 85 
TO 90 RANGE. 

BY TOMORROW NIGHT THE SHORTWAVE IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN INTO A 
PERSISTENT SHEAR AXIS THAT WILL EXTEND FROM MIDDLE TN THROUGH NORTH 
MS AND INTO NORTHERN LA OVER THE WEEKEND. THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT 
SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH THE REGION SO POPS IN THAT REGION SHOULD 
REMAIN LOW...ALTHOUGH THE THREAT CAN NOT BE ELIMINATED. TEMPS OVER 
THE WEEKEND WILL CONTINUE TO RETURN TO NORMAL WITH COOLER TEMPS 
EXPECTED OVER NORTHEAST MS DUE TO MORE CLOUD COVER. 

FORECAST FOR EARLY TO MID WEEK NOW RATHER UNCERTAIN. BOTH GFS AND 
ETA INDICATE A TROPICAL SYSTEM MAKING LANDFALL NEAR NEW ORLEANS LATE 
SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY. MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM SHOULD 
GET CAUGHT BY THE SHEAR AXIS AND GET PULLED NORTHEASTWARD. FORECAST 
WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON EXACT POSITION OF LANDFALL AND WHERE THE 
SHEAR AXIS SETS UP. BUT AS OF NOW...LOOKS LIKE MOISTURE WILL BE 
STREAMING THROUGH NORTHEAST MS BEGINNING ON MONDAY AND CONTINUE 
UNTIL WEDNESDAY WHEN THE REMNANTS OF THE SYSTEM SHIFT EASTWARD INTO 
ALABAMA. BESIDES THE CHANCES OF RAIN AND CLOUDS...THIS WILL IMPACT 
TEMPS GOING INTO NEXT WEEK. WITHOUT THE CLOUDS/RAIN...TEMPS IN THE 
LOW TO MID 90S WOULD BE POSSIBLE. AFTER WEDNESDAY...LOOKS LIKE RIDGE

WILL BEGIN WITH LOW CHANCES OF RAIN OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS TONIGHT. 
MODELS SHOWING THE PRIMARY MOISTURE AXIS GRADUALLY SHIFTING EASTWARD 
DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. THIS MAIN AXIS SHOULD MOVE INTO EAST 
ARKANSAS DURING THE MORNING AND INTO NORTHWEST MS AND WEST TN INTO 
THE AFTERNOON. CLOUD COVER AND MOISTURE RETURN SHOULD KEEP TEMPS UP 
TONIGHT. TEMPS OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS SHOULD BE HELD IN THE LOW TO 
MID 80S DUE TO MORE CLOUDS AND BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN. 
ELSEWHERE...CLOUDS AND THREAT FOR RAIN SHOULD KEEP TEMPS IN THE 85 
TO 90 RANGE. 

BY TOMORROW NIGHT THE SHORTWAVE IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN INTO A 
PERSISTENT SHEAR AXIS THAT WILL EXTEND FROM MIDDLE TN THROUGH NORTH 
MS AND INTO NORTHERN LA OVER THE WEEKEND. THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT 
SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH THE REGION SO POPS IN THAT REGION SHOULD 
REMAIN LOW...ALTHOUGH THE THREAT CAN NOT BE ELIMINATED. TEMPS OVER 
THE WEEKEND WILL CONTINUE TO RETURN TO NORMAL WITH COOLER TEMPS 
EXPECTED OVER NORTHEAST MS DUE TO MORE CLOUD COVER. 

FORECAST FOR EARLY TO MID WEEK NOW RATHER UNCERTAIN. BOTH GFS AND 
ETA INDICATE A TROPICAL SYSTEM MAKING LANDFALL NEAR NEW ORLEANS LATE 
SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY. MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM SHOULD 
GET CAUGHT BY THE SHEAR AXIS AND GET PULLED NORTHEASTWARD. FORECAST 
WILL BE DEPENDENT UPON EXACT POSITION OF LANDFALL AND WHERE THE 
SHEAR AXIS SETS UP. BUT AS OF NOW...LOOKS LIKE MOISTURE WILL BE 
STREAMING THROUGH NORTHEAST MS BEGINNING ON MONDAY AND CONTINUE 
UNTIL WEDNESDAY WHEN THE REMNANTS OF THE SYSTEM SHIFT EASTWARD INTO 
ALABAMA. BESIDES THE CHANCES OF RAIN AND CLOUDS...THIS WILL IMPACT 
TEMPS GOING INTO NEXT WEEK. WITHOUT THE CLOUDS/RAIN...TEMPS IN THE 
LOW TO MID 90S WOULD BE POSSIBLE. AFTER WEDNESDAY...LOOKS LIKE RIDGE 
SETS UP OVER THE AREA AND 850 TEMPS CLIMB TO NEAR +21 CORRELATING TO 
SFC TEMPS IN THE MID 90S WITH UPPER 90S NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.

THROUGH SUNDAY THAT WILL SLOWLY LIFT OUT TO THE EAST TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY. MEANWHILE A RIDGE WILL BUILD IN THE SOUTHWEST AND START
SPREADING EASTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY WEDNESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE EASTERN STATES WILL
MOVE SLOWLY EASTWARD TODAY AND TONIGHT. A WEAK TROF OVER THE CENTRAL
STATES WILL REACH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY FRIDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL
CONTINUE SLOWLY ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TO THE APPALACHIANS
SATURDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND IT MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS
HIGH WILL REMAIN STATIONARY AND WEAKEN AS THE TROF BECOMES ANCHORED
ALONG THE EAST COAST SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

THE RESULT WILL BE AN INCREASE IN HEAT AND HUMIDITY FOR THE NEXT
SEVERAL DAYS WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE

AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN TIER STATES WILL CONTINUE

DEEP TROF OVER EASTERN CANADA AND THE NORTHERN U.S. WILL DEPRESS
THE RIDGE FURTHER SOUTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY THEN DROP DOWN INTO THE
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TUESDAY. A CLOSED LOW WILL FORM OVER THE

AT THE SURFACE IS AN ILL DEFINED PRESSURE PATTERN OVER THE

EXTENDING FROM PENNSYLVANIA ALONG THE OHIO VALLEY ACROSS SOUTHEAST
MISSOURI AND NORTHWEST ARKANSAS WILL MAKE SLOW PROGRESS SOUTHWARD.
THIS FRONT WILL MOVE INTO NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE MID SOUTH TODAY

BECAUSE OF OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES PENETRATING THE REGION FROM EARLIER
CONVECTION TO THE NORTHEAST THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE HARD TO

WILL CAUSE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OVER THE

HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH WILL BUILD INTO THE MID SOUTH WITH
SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER AIR SUNDAY AND MONDAY EXCEPT FOR ISOLATED

PERSISTENCE SEEMS TO BE THE WEATHER WORD RIGHT NIGHT. UPPER RIDGE
STILL SQUARELY PLACED OVER THE MIDSOUTH WHILE HIGH PRESSURE IS
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. EXPECT DAYTIME CUMULUS TO
DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET AND CIRRUS FROM THE STORMS IN THE MIDWEST
SHOULD THIN OUT AS THEY WORK INTO THE RIDGE. THUS...EXPECT A
MOSTLY CLEAR NIGHT. WINDS WILL BECOME LIGHT AND TEMPERATURES DROP
INTO THE LOWER 70S...EXCEPT FOR THE MEMPHIS AIRPORT HEAT ISLAND
WHERE IT WILL ONLY GET DOWN TO THE MID 70S.

THURSDAY SHOULD BE A LITTLE HOTTER AS WE REMAIN UNDER THE RIDGE
AND MORE OF THE SUNS ENERGY IS BUDGETED FOR HEATING AIR NEAR THE
SURFACE RATHER THAN BEING USED TO EVAPORATE PLANT AND SOIL
MOISTURE. THE HEAT INDEX WILL REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA.

STILL EXPECT A FRONT TO BE NEAR OR IN NORTHERN COUNTIES OF THE
AREA BY FRI MORN. THIS FRONT/WEAK VORTICITY SHOULD ALLOW
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP DURING THE DAY. SPC SAYS
PROBABILITY OF SEVERE STORMS IS LOW FOR FRI AND FRI NIGHT.

THE FRONT SHOULD WORK ITS WAY ON SOUTH SATURDAY AND UPPER FLOW
SHOULD BECOME ZONAL. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP
SAT...BUT ACTIVITY SHOULD FINALLY DIMINISH SAT NIGHT.

SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE DRY AND NOT AS HOT. SHOWERS
COULD DEVELOP IN EASTERN MIDSOUTH COUNTIES MONDAY...TUE...AND WED
DUE TO A TROUGH THAT WILL DIG TO THE GULF. BELOW NORMAL
TEMPERATURES WILL PERSIST SUNDAY INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

A SFC HIGH OVER THE SE STATES WILL REMAIN IN PLACE TODAY WHILE THE 
500MB HIGH OVER OK/TX BUILDS TO THE EAST. THE WARMING ALOFT FROM THE 
UPPER HIGH WILL CAUSE TEMPS TODAY TO BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN 
YESTERDAY. EXPECT A MAINLY SUNNY DAY WITH A FEW MORE CLOUDS POSSIBLE 
IN NE PARTS OF CWA DUE TO MORE CU COVERAGE AND SOME CIRRUS ADVECTION 
FROM THE N. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE TOO STABLE FOR TSTMS TODAY.

THE SFC HIGH BECOMES CENTERED OVER MS GULF COAST THU AND OVER THE LA 
COAST FRI. THE ASSOCIATED 500MB RIDGE WILL BROADLY COVER THE LWR MS 
VLY. THURSDAY WILL BE WARMER THAN TODAY WITH SEVERAL AREAS REACHING 
THE MID 90S AND AFTERNOON HEAT INDICES RANGING FROM 100 TO 105. 
FRIDAY WILL BE A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER...MAINLY FROM INCREASED 
HUMIDITY AND MORE CU. ALSO...AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT FROM THE N 
WILL HELP TRIGGER MAINLY PM TSTMS FRI.

THE COLD FRONT WILL ENTER THE NRN PART OF THE CWA FRI NITE...MOVE 
INTO NRN MS SAT PM AND CLEAR THE REST OF THE CWA SAT NITE. A CHC OF 
SHWRS/TSTMS WILL EXIST ALONG AND AHEAD OF THIS FRONT.

EXPECT DRY WX SUN-SUN NITE WITH A COOLER AND DRIER AIRMASS IN PLACE.

WE CAN EXPECT ANOTHER NICE SUMMER DAY TODAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE

UPSTREAM IN NORTH-NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...BUT THIS IS ALREADY
THINNING OUT. PATCHY FOG IS VERY LOCALIZED THIS MORNING...AND DOES
NOT APPEAR TO WARRANT BEING PUTTING IN THE ZONES. SKIES ARE EXPECTED
TO BE MOSTLY SUNNY TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES TWO OR THREE DEGREES
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. DEWPOINTS WILL REMAIN IN THE 60S KEEPING
HUMIDITIES BEARABLE.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL RIDGE INTO THE MIDSOUTH FROM THE WEST TUESDAY...
AND MESOETA INDICATES A 500 MB HIGH OF 5920 M CENTERED OVER
SOUTHERN MO WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...MORE LIKE WHAT YOU WOULD EXPECT
FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. AS A RESULT...WE WILL SEE TEMPERATURES
CLIMBING BACK TO NORMAL BY MID-WEEK WITH DEWPOINTS CLIMBING BACK TO
AROUND 70. NO RAIN IS EXPECTED THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS THE ATMOSPHERE
REMAINS CAPPED.

CURRENT FORECAST/GRIDS INDICATES NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS STARTING THURSDAY. THIS STILL LOOKS GOOD. RIDGE
BEGINS TO WEAKEN BY THIS TIME. MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY ALSO
INCREASE. GFS INDICATES NEXT FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY
INTO SATURDAY WITH A CONTINUED CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. GFS MODEL
OUTPUT WOULD INDICATE COOLER TEMPERATURES SUNDAY THAN WE ARE

CLIMBING BACK TO NORMAL BY MID-WEEK WITH DEWPOINTS CLIMBING BACK TO
AROUND 70. NO RAIN IS EXPECTED THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS THE ATMOSPHERE
REMAINS CAPPED.

CURRENT FORECAST/GRIDS INDICATES NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS STARTING THURSDAY. THIS STILL LOOKS GOOD. RIDGE
BEGINS TO WEAKEN BY THIS TIME. MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY ALSO
INCREASE. GFS INDICATES NEXT FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY
INTO SATURDAY WITH A CONTINUED CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. GFS MODEL
OUTPUT WOULD INDICATE COOLER TEMPERATURES SUNDAY THAN WE ARE
PRESENTLY FORECAST WITH COOL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING INTO THE MIDSOUTH
FROM THE NORTH. HOWEVER...GFSX MOS GUIDANCE AGREES WITH OUR PRESENT
FORECAST WHICH MESHES WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. WILL LEAVE ALONE
ATTM.

THE MCS THAT WENT THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH DURING THE DAY YESTERDAY LEFT
OUR ATMOSPHERE STABILIZED OVERNIGHT ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. LATEST
LAPS INDICATES LIFTED INDICES AROUND ZERO. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS
INDICATES A COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF MO.
A FEW SHOWERS HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THIS FRONT NEAR THE
MO BOOTHEEL. LARGE MCS OVER SOUTHEASTERN AR INTO CENTRAL MS WILL
CONTINUE MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD AWAY FROM OUR AREA.

FOR TODAY...THE COLD FRONT TO OUR NORTH WILL GRADUALLY PUSH THROUGH
THE MIDSOUTH. IT IS INTERESTING THAT NORTHWESTERLY UPPER FLOW
EXTENDS FROM CANADA TO THE MIDSOUTH...UNUSUAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE
YEAR. THUS THE COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH.
DRY AIR ALOFT WILL BE SPREADING INTO THE AREA ALLOWING FOR SOME
SUNSHINE. WILL HAVE POPS TODAY RANGING FROM 20 PERCENT NORTHEAST AR
INTO NORTHWEST TN TO 40 PERCENT ACROSS PART OF NORTH MS. MESOETA
INDICATES BEST CONVERGENCE AND HIGHEST CAPES DEVELOPING ACROSS
PARTS OF NORTH MS LATER THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON. CAPES ARE
FORECAST TO INCREASE TO NEAR 3000 J/KG ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH MS.
SPC HAS AREA AROUND TUPELO AND SOUTHEASTWARD IN A SLIGHT RISK OF
SEVERE FOR TODAY...WILL MENTION THIS IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER
OUTLOOK. GREATEST THREAT WILL BE DAMAGING WIND AND LARGE HAIL.

AFTER TODAY...WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST INTO THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK. MESOETA DOES INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SHOWERS
TONIGHT AS A WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH. HOWEVER...BY THIS
TIME MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED. THUS WILL KEEP POPS LESS THAN 15
PERCENT. SUNDAY AND MONDAY WILL BE VERY NICE FOR THIS TIME OF THE
YEAR WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND LOW HUMIDITY. GRADUAL
WARMING CAN BE EXPECTED AFTER THAT.

THE LATEST GFS SHOWS A MCS POSSIBLY AFFECTING THE MIDSOUTH NEXT
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE IS VERY LOW THAT FAR OUT. FOR

BECOMING SEVERE. WILL GO WITH A RANGE FROM 40 POPS UP NORTH TO 70 
POPS SOUTH. 

FRONT WILL LINGER AROUND THE CWA DURING THE MORNING HOURS BUT SHOULD 
BE PUSHING OUT OF THE AREA BY LATE AFTERNOON. SATURDAY NIGHT SHOULD 
BE DRY.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA SUNDAY AND WILL BRING DRY 
CONDITIONS TO THE MIDSOUTH THROUGH WEDNESDAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL 
CREEP BACK INTO THE 90S DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN PUSHING INTO 
THE CWA FROM THE NORTHWEST BRINGING THE NEXT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA. WILL GO WITH 20 TO 30 POPS.

AN UNUSUAL WEATHER PATTERN FOR JULY WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE MIDSOUTH
THE NEXT FEW DAYS. HIGH AMPLITUDE UPPER FLOW WILL EXIST OVER THE
CENTRAL US. THE MIDSOUTH WILL REMAIN IN NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH
HEIGHTS BELOW NORMAL. STORMY WEATHER WILL OCCUR TODAY INTO
SATURDAY...FOLLOWED BY COOLER THAN NORMAL WEATHER SUNDAY AND MONDAY
WITH LOW AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES.

MADE ONLY SOME SMALL CHANGES TO CURRENT FORECAST. FORECAST OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY FOR MUCH OF THE AREA LOOKS GOOD
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. A THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX IS ALREADY OCCURRING
UPSTREAM ACROSS NORTHERN MO. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL DRIVE
THESE STORMS DIRECTLY TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH. THEY WILL PROBABLY WEAKEN
EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT BOUNDARIES/REMNANTS OF THIS COMPLEX WILL
RE-IGNITE WITH DAYTIME HEATING. IN ADDITION...A FRONTAL BOUNDARY
EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL AR INTO SOUTHERN MS. RADARS INDICATE
THUNDERSTORMS FIRING ALONG THIS BOUNDARY THIS MORNING. THIS FRONT
WILL PUSH NORTHEASTWARD TOWARD THE MIDSOUTH TODAY AS A WARM FRONT. AS
A RESULT...MUGGY AND UNSTABLE AIR WILL ONCE AGAIN PUSH INTO THE
MIDSOUTH. SPC INDICATES A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE FOR THE MIDSOUTH
TODAY AND TONIGHT WHICH LOOKS GOOD...THE MAIN THREATS BEING
DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL.

A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH SLOWLY THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH SATURDAY. RAIN
CHANCES WILL DECREASE FROM THE NORTH WITH PASSAGE OF THE FRONT.
HOWEVER...WE DID ADD A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR ABOUT
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE MIDSOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT WILL BE
SLOW TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA.

SUNDAY WILL BE A NICE SUMMER DAY WITH LOWER HUMIDITY AND
TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL. GRADUAL WARMING WILL OCCUR AFTER SUNDAY AS
THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SHIFTS TO THE EAST WITH RIDGING PUSHES IN
FROM THE WEST.

92-94 RANGE AND MUGGY CONDS...EXPECT HEAT INDICES AROUND 100 THIS 
AFTN. CANNOT RULE OUT AN ISOLD AFTN/EVENING TSTM. 

TUESDAY...5960M 500 MB RIDGE SITTING OVER THE WESTERN PLAINS WILL 
STRENGTHEN ITS GRIP ON THE MID SOUTH DURING THE DAY. 850MB TEMPS WL 
REACH 21-22C AND SFC TEMPS SHOULD REACH INTO THE MID 90S FROM 
CLARKSDALE-JACKSON WESTWARD. HEAT INDICES SHOULD RANGE FROM 100-105 
WITH READINGS ABOVE 105 ACRS THE DELTA FROM MEMPHIS SOUTHWARD. 
TUESDAY NIGHT WL BE QUITE MUGGY WITH LOWS IN THE MID 70S...PERHAPS

HIGH PRESSURE IS SITUATED OVER SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI THIS AFTERNOON 
AND IT HAS BEEN SLOWLY MOVING WESTWARD OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS. THIS 
HIGH IS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE MOVING THROUGH THE 
REGION. ISOLATED HEAT OF THE DAY THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER 
THE MIDSOUTH ONCE AGAIN TODAY AND THEY SHOULD DIMINISH DURING THE 
EVENING. 

UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BEGIN TO TURN MORE NORTHWESTERLY AS THE UPPER 
RIDGE MOVES INTO LOUISIANA TONIGHT AND ON MONDAY. WARMER AIR FROM 
OUT WEST WILL BE ADVECTED INTO THE REGION WITH AFTERNOON HIGHS 
RISING ABOUT A DEGREE OR TWO EACH DAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE AS INDICATED BY GFS AND ETA IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE FLOW 
TURNING NORTHWESTERLY. BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON...THIS SHORTWAVE AND 
SOME POSITIVE UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION WILL BE OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI. 
CONVECTION SHOULD THERE SHOULD STILL BE SCATTERED...ALTHOUGH MORE 
WIDESPREAD THAN TODAY. ELSEWHERE...LOOKS LIKE ONE MORE DAY OF 
ISOLATED TSTRMS. FYI...HEAT INDICIES ABOVE 100 TOMORROW. 

THE AIR BEING ADVECTED INTO THE REGION IS MUCH DRIER FROM 850 THRU 
500MB THAN PRESENT AIR MASS. SO EXPECT LESS CU AND PROBABLY NOT EVEN 
ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY. 850 TEMPS CLIMB TO AROUND 
+20 OVER NORTHEAST MS TO +22 OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. THIS SHOULD 
TRANSLATE TO AROUND 94/96 RESPECTIVELY. MAV DEW POINTS MAY BE A 
TOUCH TOO HIGH DURING THE DAY WITH THE AMOUNT OF MID LEVEL DRY AIR 
AVAILABLE TO TAP INTO...MAX DPS DURING THE DAY SHOULD STAY AROUND 
73F. STILL...HEAT INDICIES WILL BE NEAR 105. 

ON WEDNESDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO DIG ACROSS THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE COUNTRY AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL ARRIVE DURING THE 
AFTERNOON/EVENING. TIMING OF THE FRONT CRITICAL IN FORECAST HIGHS. 
850 TEMPS AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL BE +22...TRANSLATING INTO MID TO 
UPPER 90S. GFS AND ETA IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING THE FRONT 
INTO NORTHWEST TN AND NORTHEAST AR BY 18Z WHICH SHOULD HINDER THE 
TEMPS THERE DURING THE AFTERNOON. NOT A LOT OF MOISTURE 
AVAILABLE...ALTHOUGH GIVEN GOOD INSTABILITY AROUND (CAPES > 2000J/KG 
AND LIS AROUND -6) EXPECT A FEW SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE 
FRONT. HEAT INDICIES AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL BE AROUND OR JUST ABOVE 
105. THE COMBINATION OF HEAT INDICIES NEAR 105 BOTH DAYS AND 
OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S...A HEAT ADVISORY MAY NEED TO 
BE ISSUED OVER PORTIONS OF THE REGION FOR THE PERIOD OF TUES/WED IF 
CURRENT FORECAST HOLDS. 

AFTER WEDNESDAY...COOLER/DRIER AIR MASS BUILDS OVER THE REGION WITH 
GFS EVEN SUGGESTING 850 TEMPS FALLING TO +15 BY 12Z FRI. INSTABILITY 
SHOULD STAY MAINLY ALONG THE GULF COAST...SO LOOKS LIKE A REPRIEVE 
FROM CONVECTION FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. TOWARDS NEXT WEEKEND...SURFACE 
HIGH MOVES OFF TO THE EAST AND SOUTHERLY MOIST FLOW GRADUALLY BEGINS 
TO MOVE BACK INTO THE REGION. ALTHOUGH...850-500MB RH FIELDS LOOK 
LOW ENOUGH TO STICK WITH A DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S...A HEAT ADVISORY MAY NEED TO 
BE ISSUED OVER PORTIONS OF THE REGION FOR THE PERIOD OF TUES/WED IF 
CURRENT FORECAST HOLDS. 

AFTER WEDNESDAY...COOLER/DRIER AIR MASS BUILDS OVER THE REGION WITH 
GFS EVEN SUGGESTING 850 TEMPS FALLING TO +15 BY 12Z FRI. INSTABILITY 
SHOULD STAY MAINLY ALONG THE GULF COAST...SO LOOKS LIKE A REPRIEVE

HIGH MOVES OFF TO THE EAST AND SOUTHERLY MOIST FLOW GRADUALLY BEGINS 
TO MOVE BACK INTO THE REGION. ALTHOUGH...850-500MB RH FIELDS LOOK 
LOW ENOUGH TO STICK WITH A DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

WEAK UPPER TROF FROM ERN TX INTO AR BISECTS THE SRN U.S. UPPER RIDGE 
THIS MORNING. ISOLD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THIS 
AREA...INCLUDING A FEW IN PHILLIPS COUNTY. HOWEVER...ACTIVITY 
CONTINUES TO BE ON THE DOWNSWING ATTM. FOG NOT MUCH OF A PROBLEM 
THIS MORNING.

EXPECT THE WEAK UPPER TROF TO RETROGRADE SLOWLY WWD DURING THE DAY 
AS THE BERMUDA HIGH COVERING THE SE U.S. STRENGTHENS. AIRMASS ACROSS 
THE REGION WILL BE MOIST AND UNSTABLE...THOUGH PERHAPS NOT AS MUCH 
AS PAST DAYS SINCE MID LEVEL TEMPS WILL WARM SLIGHTLY AND LAPSE 
RATES WILL BE NOT QUITE AS STEEP. WITH NO REAL TRIGGER SO EXPECT 
AFTN HEATING TO RESULT IN ISOLD THUNDERSTORMS THRU THE EARLY EVENING

WARM FRONT IS ORIENTED WEST TO EAST ACROSS CENTRAL MISSOURI. A 
BERMUDA HIGH IS NEAR THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. AN UPPER RIDGE IS OVER 
THE SOUTHWESTERN US. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER VORT MAX 
EXTENDING THROUGH SOUTHERN ARKANSAS INTO CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. MOST 
OF THE CONVECTION TODAY HAS DEVELOPED NEAR THE VORT MAX ALTHOUGH 
WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION ELSEWHERE. AN MCS HAS 
DEVELOPED THIS AFTERNOON OVER WESTERN MISSOURI IN RESPONSE TO A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE REGION. 

EXPECT THAT THE MCS OVER WESTERN MISSOURI WILL NOT ARRIVE. IT 
APPEARS THAT THE FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE BERMUDA HIGH HAS BUILT FAR 
ENOUGH INTO THE REGION TO PREVENT THE MCS FROM MAKING ANY 
APPRECIABLE MOVEMENT INTO THE AREA. OTHER CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH 
THIS EVENING WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. WET MICROBURST POTENTIAL 
STILL EXISTS EARLY THIS EVENING WITH HIGH INSTABILITY IN PLACE OVER 
THE AREA. EXPECT SOME PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY 
TOMORROW MORNING DUE TO HIGH DEW POINTS...MOIST GROUND AND LIGHT 
WINDS ALTHOUGH DONT THINK IT WILL BE DENSE ENOUGH OR WIDESPREAD 
ENOUGH TO MENTION IN FORECAST. 

MODELS SHOWING BERMUDA HIGH MOVING OVER THE REGION ON FRIDAY WITH NO 
SIGNIFICANT UPPER LEVEL VORT MAXS IN THE AREA. THE BERMUDA HIGH 
SHOULD BE THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE FOR THE MIDSOUTH THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND. NOT SAYING THAT EVERYONE WILL BE DRY. INSTABILITY STILL 
EXPECTED TO REMAIN HIGH...ANYWHERE BETWEEN 3 AND 4000 J/KG STILL. 
WITH NO LOW LEVEL FORCING MECHANISMS AROUND OR AREAS OF LIFT...AREAL 
COVERAGE SHOULD BE LIMITED TO IDEAL HEAT OF THE DAY ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS. ADDITIONALLY...WITH THE HIGH INSTABILITY IN PLACE 
SOME OF THESE STORMS STILL COULD BE SEVERE WITH LOCALIZED MICROBURST 
POSSIBLE. 850 TEMPS AND GUIDANCE VALUES INDICATING HIGHS AROUND 90. 
DEW POINTS SHOULD KEEP LOWS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S.

EARLY TO MID NEXT WEEK THE BERMUDA HIGH WILL MOVE WEST OF THE REGION 
AND UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME NORTHWESTERLY OVER THE AREA. FORECAST AT 
THIS POINT BECOMES RATHER TRICKY. EXPECT THAT EVENTUALLY A COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION ALTHOUGH UNCERTAIN AS TO EXACTLY 
WHICH DAY WITH MODELS HAVING TROUBLE ANALYZING THE FRONT DUE TO 
CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK PROBLEMS. FURTHERMORE...THERE COULD BE AN 
OVERNIGHT MCS THAT DEVELOPS AND MOVES THROUGH THE REGION SINCE HIGH 
INSTABILITY WILL STILL BE IN PLACE AND UPPER FLOW BECOMING MORE 
FAVORABLE FOR THAT SCENARIO. FEEL THAT POPS ARE PROBABLY TOO LOW

A VIGOROUS UPPER LOW IS NOW CROSSING THE MID MS VLY AND IS TRACKING 
NEWD TOWARD NRN IL. BANDS OF TSTMS HAVE DEVELOPED AROUND THIS 
SYSTEM...ESPECIALLY FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE OH VLY. SCT 
SHWRS/TSTMS HAVE RECENTLY DEVELOPED OVER SRN MO WITH ISOLATED 
ACTIVITY TO THE SOUTH. EXPECT ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT OF SCT TSTMS 
OVER AR THIS AFTERNOON MOVING EWD ACROSS OUR AREA THIS EVENING. SPC 
HAS SLIGHT RISK OF SVR FOR MAINLY ERN PARTS OF THE CWA. GENERALLY 
SPEAKING...THE RISK OF SVR IS DECREASING WITH TIME OVER OUR CWA AND 
INCREASING OVER THE OH VLY.

A BROAD SUBTROPICAL HIGH WILL EXPAND ACROSS THE SE STATES SUNDAY. 
PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL REMAIN OVER THE CWA BUT NO 
TRIGGER TO PRODUCE ANY MORE THAN AN ISOLATED PM TSTM. SINCE POPS 
WILL BE LESS THAN 15 PERCENT SUNDAY...WILL KEEP THAT DAY DRY. WARMER 
TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS SUNDAY WILL CREATE HEAT INDICES BETWEEN 100 AND 
105 DEG F.

A POTENTIAL MCS MAY DEVELOP WELL TO THE NW LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
PROVIDE A SMALL CHC SHWRS/TSTMS DURING THE PERIOD. THE CHANCE OF 
TSTMS MAY BE UP A NOTCH WED-THU DUE TO A STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO 
THE NORTH. OTHERWISE...SUMMERLIKE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED WITH WARM 
TEMPS AND LOW CHCS OF MAINLY PM TSTMS.

A BOUNDARY FROM A DYING MCS EARIER THIS MORNING HAS PUSHED MORE THAN 
HALF WAY ACROSS OUR CWA AT THIS TIME. IT VAGUELY EXTENDS ACROSS WRN 
TN/NRN MS. THE MAIN REMNANTS OF THE PCPN IS OVER SRN AR.

UPPER LOW IN NRN MO. WILL KEEP AREA UNDER THE SLIGHT RISK OF SVR 
SINCE SHEAR WILL BE UNSEASONABLY STRONG COMBINED WITH MODERATE

AN UNSEASONABLY DEEP LOW IS SPINNING ACROSS ERN KS AT THIS TIME. 
SEVERAL BANDS OF TSTMS EXTEND FROM THIS LOW. ONE COMPLEX IS OVER AR

COMPLEX OVER AR TO CONTINUE PROGRESSING EWD INTO THE EVENING AND

STRONG TO SEVERE WITH POSSIBLE WIND AND HAIL.

THE DEEP LOW WILL MOVE EWD ACROSS THE MID MS VLY SATURDAY. LOBES OF 
VORT ENERGY ON THE SOUTH SIDE WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT GOOD CHANCES 
OF SHWRS/TSTMS OVER OUR CWA. AMPLE AMOUNT OF DIRECTIONAL SHEAR WILL 
SUPPORT THE RISK OF SVR WX SAT WITH ROTATING SUPERCELLS POSSIBLE. 
THE LOW PULLS WELL TO THE NE AFTER SAT...SO DRIER WX WILL OCCUR 
SUN-MON EXCEPT FOR AN ISOLATED TSTM.

A SUBTROPICAL HIGH WILL BECOME MORE ESTABLISHED OVER THE SE STATES

TONIGHT...PRECIP WL BE MOST WIDESPREAD ACRS NW MS AND WL GO WITH 
CATEGORICAL POPS THERE EARLY THIS EVENING WITH LIKELY POPS ELSW. 
EXPECT ACTIVITY TO DIMINISH AS THE EVENING WEARS ON AND THE 
SHORTWAVE CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST OF THE REGION. WL TAPER POPS DOWN 
INTO THE CHANCE CATEGORY THIS EVENING. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE 
REDEVELOPMENT AFT MIDNIGHT AS THE MAIN UPPER TROF ENCROACHES.

FRIDAY...MAIN UPPER TROF MOVES INTO SW MO/NW AR BY LATE FRI. AIRMASS 
STILL PLENTY MOIST AND EXPECT NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ONCE AGAIN. PREFER THE ETA SURFACE PATTERN 
WITH ITS WEAKER SURFACE REFLECTION. GFS SURFACE LOW IS TOO DEEP AND 
RESULTS IN A DRY SLOT THAT PROBABLY WL NOT OCCUR. TEMPS STILL 
REMAINING IN THE LOW AND MID 80S.

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...UPPER TROF AXIS STRETCHES FROM 
NRN MO INTO MS BY 12Z SAT. PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND LIFT TO JUSTIFY 
LIKELY POPS ACRS WRN HALF OF THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND THE ENTIRE 
AREA ON SATURDAY. BY 12Z SUN UPPER TROF AXIS WL BE ALIGNED ALONG THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY AND WL BE TAPERING POPS FROM WEST TO EAST AS A 
SHORTWAVE RIDGE BUILDS IN. ATTM IT LOOKS LIKE MOST OF THE AREA WL BE 
DRY FOR INDEPENDENCE DAY...AT LEAST AFTER THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. 
TEMPS WL START TO WARM AS WELL...WITH READINGS CLIMBING INTO THE MID 
AND UPPER 80S.

EXTENDED...SFC AND UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SE U.S. BEGINNING TO 
DOMINATE THE WEATHER PICTURE NEXT WEEK. LOOKS LIKE A SHIFT TO A 
WARMER PATTERN...PERHAPS BREAKING 90...WITH DIURNAL CONVECTION. GFS 
DOES HINT AT A WEAK FRONT ON WED.

CURRENT FORECAST IS OK. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES A VERY 
WEAK NEARLY STATIONARY WEST TO EAST SURFACE BOUNDARY FROM NORTHEAST 
AR INTO NORTHWEST TN. SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE STILL GOING ALONG AND SOUTH OF THIS BOUNDARY. 
THINK THEY WILL GRADUALLY DIMINISH IN COVERAGE AND STRENGTH WITH 
SUNSET AND THE ATMOSPHERE GRADUALLY BECOMING MORE STABLE. 
HOWEVER...WEAK EMBEDDED LOWS IN THE UPPER FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO 
OVERRIDE THE RIDGE CENTERED TO OUR SOUTH AND MOVE OVER THE MIDSOUTH 
FROM THE WEST DURING THE NIGHT. THIS WILL CONTINUE AT LEAST SOME 
THREAT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. FORECAST 
OVERNIGHT LOWS AND SKY ARE FINE.

SURFACE BOUNDARY CONTINUES TO BE LOCATED ALONG/NEAR INTERSTATE 40 
THIS AFTERNOON. MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS COVERS THE MID SOUTH  
WITH AFTN HEATING AND A WEAK SHORTWAVE PROMOTING SCATTERED TO 
NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. THUNDERSTORMS MOST NUMEROUS SOUTH 
OF THE BOUNDARY. 

TONIGHT...WEAK SHORTWAVE COMBINED WITH SURFACE BOUNDARY WL RESULT 
IN SCT/NUMEROUS THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT. MOST OF THE ACTIVITY WL 
PROBABLY BE DURING THE EVENING HOURS BUT ENUF LIFT TO ENSURE AT 
LEAST SOME ACTIVITY THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. WL GO WITH HIGHEST POPS 
SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY...BASICALLY FROM THE MEMPHIS METRO AREA 
SOUTHWARD. 

WEDNESDAY...BOUNDARY STILL HANGING AROUND WITH A UPPER LEVEL SHEAR 
AXIS STALLED ACRS THE REGION. DEEP MOISTURE AND MODERATE INSTABILITY 
WL LEAD TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH TEMPS CONTINUING 
TO BE ON THE COOL SIDE IN THE LOW TO MID 80S. 

THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...UPPER LOW FORECAST BY BOTH MODELS TO DEVELOP 
ACRS SW MO BY 00Z SAT. THIS WL KEEP THE MID SOUTH IN A WARM...MOIST 
AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS PRIME FOR AT LEAST SCT THUNDERSTORMS THU AND 
FRI...ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTN/EVENING HOURS. TEMPS WL CONT TO BE

WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WERE OCCURRING OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTHWESTERN TENNESSEE AND 
NORTH MISSISSIPPI. A FEW SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER SOUTHWEST 
TENNESSEE IN RESPONSE TO WEAK INSTABILITY...IN ASSOCIATION WITH A 
BOUNDARY SEEN ON VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WAS 
CREEPING INTO THE NORTHWESTERN FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON 
DISCERNIBLE BY A WEAK WIND SHIFT. ADDITIONAL STORMS WERE FIRING 
OVER  SOUTHERN ARKANSAS WHERE THEY BEGAN FIRING EARLIER THIS 
MORNING. THE STORMS THAT FORMED OVER THIS AREA THIS MORNING WEAKENED 
AS THEY MOVED INTO NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI.

THE UPPER PATTERN WILL BE SLOW TO CHANGE. THEREFORE THE FETCH OF 
MOISTURE FROM SOUTHERN MEXICO...ACROSS TEXAS AND NORTHERN 
LOUISIANA/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS INTO ALABAMA AND TENNESSEE WILL CONTINUE 
TO BRING A CHANCE OF RAIN TO THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS. NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI WILL HAVE THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN WHILE 
RAIN CHANCES TAPER OFF FARTHER NORTH INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS...THE 
MISSOURI BOOTHEEL AND NORTHWEST TENNESSEE. 

WEAK DISTURBANCES IN THE FLOW OVER THE MID SOUTH WILL PRODUCE 
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY. IT WILL BE 
PARTICULARLY DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN ONE SPECIFIC TRIGGER MECHANISM 
OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS...BUT HAVE CONCENTRATED ON THE BETTER CHANCES 
OF RAIN OVER NORTHERN MS. 

A SHORTWAVE IS PROGGED TO TRANSLATE INTO THE MID SOUTH BY THURSDAY. 
BOTH MODELS SEEM TO HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME DEALING WITH THIS FEATURE. 
REGARDLESS...THE RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN U.S. WILL AMPLIFY AND THE 
TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. WILL DEEPEN. THIS TROUGH WILL SCOUR OUT 
THE MOISTURE FETCH AND DRAG IT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. A HIGHER CHANCE 
FOR RAIN WILL OCCUR LATE WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. ONCE THIS TROUGH

 BOTH GFS AND ETA SHOWS A COMBINATION OF THINGS COMING TOGETHER OVER

RESULT...EXPECT THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO SLOWLY MOVE NORTH. SOUTHEAST

RESULT IN AN INTENSIFICATION IN CONVECTION. WITH THE STEERING FLOW

SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS BY THE TIME THE EVENT ENDS. ON TOP OF THE 
RAINFALL THAT HAS ALREADY FALLEN IN RECENT DAYS...THIS COULD PRODUCE 
A FLOODING ISSUE OVER THESE AREAS. THUS...WILL ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH 
FOR THE AREA. 

THIS SCENARIO IS SIMILAR TO THE LAST EVENT IN TERMS OF AREAS

THE REGION IS IN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ABOVE THE SURFACE AND THERE IS A 
STRONG UPPER VORT OVER WESTERN LOUISIANA. MEANWHILE A SLOW MOVING 
SURFACE COLD FRONT EXTENDS WEST TO EAST OVER CENTRAL MISSOURI. 
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED THIS AFTERNOON 
OVER LOUISIANA AND SHOULD STREAM INTO NORTH MISSISSIPPI AND A GOOD 
PORTION OF WEST TENNESSEE TONIGHT AS THE UPPER VORT BEGINS TO LIFT 
TOWARDS THE AREA. ATMOSPHERE TONIGHT ONLY MARGINALLY UNSTABLE WITH 
CAPES LESS THAN 1000J/KG AND LIS AROUND -2 OR -3. THERE IS SOME 
MARGINAL LOW LEVEL HELICITY OF ABOUT 150 M2/S2 THAT MOVES UP THROUGH 
NORTHEAST MISSISSIPPI OVERNIGHT...HOWEVER THE WIND SHEAR IN THE MID 
AND UPPER LEVELS IS ONLY ABOUT 30KTS. SO...NOT EXPECTING WIDESPREAD 
SEVERE WEATHER. RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD BE IMPRESSIVE WITH MODELS 
SUGGESTING THAT UP TO 2 INCHES OF RAIN IS POSSIBLE OVER NORTHEAST 
MISSISSIPPI BY THE TIME THAT THE EVENT ENDS FRIDAY. WITH THE BULK OF 
THE RAIN FALLING OVER A LONG DURATION...NOT EXPECTING ANY WIDESPREAD 
FLASH FLOODING ISSUES THEREFORE NO WATCH. HOWEVER...WOULDNT BE 
SURPRISED TO SEE SOME STREAMS GET HIGH. EXPECTING A FAIRLY SHARP 
CUTOFF FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE REGION WITH THE UPPER VORT 
TRACKING OVER THE MEMPHIS REGION AND ETA/GFS SHOWING THE BEST 
DYNAMICS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE VORT. 

THE UPPER VORT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE REGION DURING THE DAY 
TOMORROW. CIRCULATION ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE VORT WILL DRAG THE 
COLD FRONT OVER CENTRAL MISSOURI INTO THE REGION AND STALL IT OUT 
OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI BY SATURDAY MORNING. ONCE AGAIN...KEEPING 
HIGHER POPS OVER WEST TN AND NORTHEAST MS WITH PROXIMITY TO THE 
UPPER VORT. CLOUDS/RAIN SHOULD KEEP TEMPS COOL ONCE AGAIN. 

THE FRONT MAY SAG JUST FAR ENOUGH SOUTH OF THE REGION TO PRODUCE A 
DRY DAY ON SATURDAY...ALTHOUGH GIVEN THE VARIABILITIES IN THE MODEL 
RUNS AM HESITANT TO COMPLETELY REMOVE POPS EXCEPT FOR NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS AND EXTREME NORTHWEST TN. AFTER SATURDAY...THE FRONT WILL 
BE MEANDERING AROUND THE REGION WHICH WILL RESULT IN CHANCES OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NEARLY EVERYDAY. BETTER CHANCES ON SUNDAY 
INTO MONDAY WITH GFS AND ETA HINTING AT A WAVE DEVELOPING ALONG THE 
FRONT AND MOVING THROUGH THE REGION. WITH CLOUD COVER AROUND AND 
FRONT TO THE SOUTH...BELOW NORMAL TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE.

WITH ONLY HINTS OF IT IN THE FORM OF A DEW POINT GRADIENT WITH MID 
60S OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND NORTHWEST TN AND LOW 70S OVER NORTH 
MISSISSIPPI. AS THE DAY GOES ON...SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL TAKE OVER 
ENTIRE REGION. AN ELONGATED VORT MAX EXTENDS FROM SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS 
INTO EAST TEXAS AND THIS VORT WILL BE SLOWLY LIFTING NORTHEASTWARD 
OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO. THE MIDSOUTH IS IN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
ALOFT...WITH TROPICAL MOISTURE STREAMING OVER SOUTHERN HALF OF THE 
AREA. LEADING EDGE OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER FROM THE SOUTH. POPS TODAY LOOK 
OKAY...WITH INCREASING CHANCES THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON AS THE VORT 
APPROACHES THE REGION. EXPECT THE VORT TO MOVE UP THE MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER VALLEY AND THEN MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS WEST TN AND NORTH MS WITH 
COINCIDING SURFACE LOW FOLLOWING SIMILAR TRACK. THIS WILL KEEP THE 
BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN IN THE WARM SECTOR...OVER WEST TN AND NORTH 
MS. UPDATED AFTERNOON FORECAST FOR SKY WORDING AND TO NUDGE TEMPS UP

PATCHY FOG MAY STILL BE AROUND FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR SO. INCLUDED IN 
THE UPDATE ARE TWEAKS TO THE SKY COVER FOR TODAY...GENERALLY SKIES

ILL-DEFINED STATIONARY FRONT IS ROUGHLY NEAR I-40. THIS FRONT WILL 
GRADUALLY WEAKEN AND WASH OUT DURING THE DAY. WATER VAPOR SHOWS A 
PLUME OF MOISTURE COMING AT US OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST. MODELS SHOW AN

LIGHT OR CALM WINDS AND VERY HUMID AIR WILL CONTINUE TO CAUSE FOG
ACROSS MAINLY WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTH MISSISSIPPI PORTIONS OF THE
MID SOUTH THIS MORNING. IN SOME PLACES THE FOG HAS BECOME LOCALLY
DENSE AT TIMES WITH VISIBILITIES AS LOW AS 1/4 MILE OR LESS. DENSE
FOG IS NOT EXPECTED TO BECOME WIDESPREAD ACROSS ANY SIGNIFICANT PARTS
OF THE MID SOUTH. THEREFORE NO ADVISORY IS ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME.
CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE AROUND 9 AM CDT.

A BROAD UPPER TROF WILL DOMINATE THE NATION FROM THE N0RTHERN PLAINS
TO THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AS IT SHIFTS
SLOWLY EASTWARD. SHORT WAVES ROTATING AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THIS
SYSTEM WILL MOVE FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY TO THE SOUTHEAST COAST.

AT THE SURFACE A STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDING FROM NORTHEAST TEXAS
ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI WILL BE THE FOCUS
OF CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN THE WARM MOIST ENVIRONMENT. THE UPPER WAVES
PASSING OVERHEAD AND WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREAS MOVING ALONG THE FRONT
WILL CAUSE IT TO MEANDER ACROSS MAINLY SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE MID
SOUTH. THE RESULT WILL BE CLOUDINESS WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE REGION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK
OCCASIONALLY BECOMING MORE NUMEROUS ACROSS NORTH MISSISSIPPI.

QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDS FROM NEAR SAVANNAH TN THROUGH 
CLARSDALE MS. UPPER FLOW OVER THE REGION REMAINS OUT OF THE 
SOUTHWEST WHICH IS ALLOWING SEVERAL IMPULSES TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
REGION. ATMOSPHERE IS RATHER STABLE OVER THE REGION WITH VERY LITTLE 
IF ANY IN THE WAY OF LIGHTNING ACTIVITY. SKIES HAVE BECOME PARTLY 
CLOUDY ACROSS NORTHEAST AR AND EXTREME NORTHWEST TN WITH SOME BREAKS 
TRYING TO MOVE SOUTHWARD.

TONIGHT...FRONT SHOULD REMAIN ROUGHLY IN PLACE. SO ANY BREAKS THAT 
WERE TO OCCUR NEAR MEMPHIS UP TOWARDS JACKSON AND SOUTHWARD SHOULD 
BE SHORT LIVED WITH MOIST FLOW CONTINUING THROUGH THE REGION. 
KEEPING LIKELY POPS GOING IN THE EXTREME SOUTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE 
FORECAST REGION WITH SHOWERS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE NEAR THAT REGION. 
NOT MENTIONING THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO LACK OF STABILITY. ALSO...EXPECT 
PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP OVERNIGHT OVER A GOOD PORTION OF WEST TN WITH 
WINDS GOING CALM...SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR OVER THE REGION AND WITH 
TODAYS RAINFALL. 

ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...THE FRONT WILL RISE NORTHWARD 
SOMEWHAT. A SHORTWAVE WILL APPROACH THE REGION AND PICK UP A RATHER 
POTENT AND ELONGATED VORT MAX OUT OF TEXAS. THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE 
LOW WILL RIDE ALONG THE FRONT. EXPECT A RATHER SHARP AREAL CUT OFF 
IN POPS WITH RAIN BEING CONTAINED TO THE WARM SECTOR. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN AN EXCELLENCE CHANCE FOR RAIN SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FRONT. 
WILL MENTION THUNDER WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY IN PLACE ALTHOUGH 
THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR SEVERE WEATHER. 
MODELS SUGGESTING THAT UP TO 2 INCHES OF RAIN IS POSSIBLE OVER 
NORTHEAST MS THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE EVENT. DONT THINK THIS WILL RAISE 
ANY FLOODING ISSUES SINCE THE RAIN SHOULD FALL OVER A LONG PERIOD OF 
TIME. HOWEVER...WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF A FEW RIVERS GET HIGH. 
EXPECT TEMPS TOMORROW (ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHEAST MS) TO BE HELD DOWN 
DUE TO CLOUDS AND RAIN. 

ON FRIDAY...THIS SYSTEM WILL LIFT AWAY FROM THE REGION BY AFTERNOON. 
IN ITS WAKE...A COLD FRONT FROM THE NORTH WILL WRAP INTO THE REGION 
AND STALL OUT OVER NORTH MISSISSIPPI. CONTINUING HIGH POPS IN THE 
MORNING WITH THE SYSTEM...MAINLY OVER EASTERN PORTIONS AND CONTINUE 
LOW CHANCE POPS INTO THE AFTERNOON WITH THE FRONT. 

AFTER FRIDAY...THERE IS LITTLE IF ANY MOVEMENT IN THE FRONT. AS A 
RESULT THERE WILL BE A THREAT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NEARLY 
EVERY DAY EITHER BY HEAT OF THE DAY OR BY WEAK IMPULSES MOVING OVER 
THE REGION. THE BETTER CHANCES LOOKS TO BE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY AS THE GFS AND ETA SUGGEST THAT ANOTHER SOMEWHAT POTENT VORT 
MAX MOVES OVER THE REGION. WITH THE CLOUDS AROUND...TEMPS SHOULD 
REMAIN BELOW NORMAL.

TURN BACK TOWARDS THE SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF THE FRONT...REMAINING NORTH 
OR NORTHEAST BEHIND THE FRONT. THE FRONT SHOULD SAG A BIT FURTHER 
SOUTH TONIGHT...PERHAPS MAKING IT AS FAR SOUTH AS I-40 BY MORNING. 
MEANWHILE...THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER TEXAS WILL BEGIN TO LIFT 
OUT AND RUN ALONG THE FRONT. WITH DESCENT INSTABILITY IN PLACE OVER 
THE REGION...EXPECT ANOTHER COMPLEX TO FIRE UP ALONG THE FRONT AND 
RUN ALONG THE FRONT OVERNIGHT. ALTHOUGH...THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO 
BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR A WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER THREAT. 
KEEPING LOW CHANCE POPS THIS EVENING...WITH THE FIRST COMPLEX 
EXITING THE AREA...MOST OF THE REGION HAS STABILIZED TO A DEGREE.

EVENING. POPS TOMORROW ARE FORECASTED LOWER BEHIND THE FRONT OVER 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. HAVE LOWERED HIGH TEMPS FOR TOMORROW DUE TO

AIR PUSH WITH THIS SYSTEM...SO TEMPS BACK INTO THE UPPER 80S TO NEAR 
90. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL SAG INTO THE REGION AND STALL OUT OVER 
THE WEEKEND. GOOD MOISTURE RECOVERY AND INSTABILITY IN PLACE WITH 
SEVERAL IMPULSES MOVING OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST AND RIDING ALONG THE

MCS THAT WAS OVER OKLAHOMA HAS PUSHED OVER TO NORTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS 
THIS MORNING.  THIS MCS WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD AS THE DAY 
PROGRESSES. THE AIRMASS MASS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WILL BECOME 
INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER LAPSE RATES AND WITH 
DEWPOINTS INCREASING NEAR 70. THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK FOR SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS WITH LARGE HAIL 
AND WIND GUSTS EXCEEDING 60 MPH BEING THE MAIN THREATS. LOOKING AT 
CURRENT RADAR TRENDS AND SATELLITE WILL PUMP UP POPS OVER NORTHEAST 
AR AND MISSOURI BOOTHEEL.

OTHERWISE NO OTHER CHANGES BESIDES THE AFOREMENTIONED INCREASE OF

CLOUD DEBRIS FROM CONVECTION THAT FORMED OVER ARKANSAS LAST NIGHT 
CONTINUE TO STREAM OVER THE MID SOUTH THIS MORNING. EXPECTING THESE

THE CHALLENGING PART OF THE FORECAST WILL BE THE TIMING OF NEXT

CAPES NEAR 2000 J/KG WILL OVERSPREAD THE MID SOUTH MONDAY NIGHT. 
THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON

WHY THIS FRONT WOULD NOT PUSH SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY

CHANCES FOR MOST AREAS WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE PERSISTING OVER THE 
EXTREME SOUTHEAST FORECAST AREA. 

ISENTROPIC SURFACES INDICATE DOWNGLIDE AS WELL AS ALREADY RELATIVELY 
DRY AIR OVER THE REGION THROUGH SUNDAY. THEREFORE RAIN CHANCES WILL 
BE RATHER SLIM THIS WEEKEND AND NOT WORTH MENTIONING IN ZONES AT

THE FRONT WASHES OUT OVER NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI SUNDAY NIGHT AND LOW

RESPONSIBILITY ON SATURDAY. 

TWO SITUATIONS CAN OCCUR SUNDAY. FIRST...THE FRONT HAS HAD ALREADY 
PROGRESSIVELY MADE IT THROUGH THE MIDSOUTH. THIS WILL LEAD TO A MORE 
BUT BRIEF NORTHERLY FLOW AND SLIGHTLY MORE STABLE AIRMASS WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE MIDWEST.  SECOND...THE AREA WILL REMAIN IN THE

THIS SITUATION WOULD LEAD TO MORE CONVECTION UPSTREAM OR NEAR THE

THE MIDSOUTH CURRENTLY HAS A JUICED UP BOUNDARY LAYER WITH SFC 
DEWPOINTS IN THE 70S. THETA-E RIDGE CURRENTLY RIDES THE MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER WHERE DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S. CURRENT TEMPS AT

WILL BE EASILY REALIZED.

NEW MESOETA / GFS SHOW BEST UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND SFC 
BASED CONVERGENCE WILL OCCUR TO THE NORTH...IN SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL 
ILLINOIS.  HOWEVER...WITH SFC AFTN TEMPS FORECAST TO REACH NEAR 
90...NO EXISTING CAP...NO SIGNIFICANT UPPER LEVEL FEATURE TO HANG 
OUR HAT ON...ANY STRONG CONVECTION THAT DOES OCCUR ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH WILL HAVE TO BE INITIATED UPSTREAM IN NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND 
SOUTHERN MISSOURI. IT IS FEASIBLE THIS UPSTREAM CONVECTION WILL 
ADVECT SOUTHEAST IN NE AR...BOOTHEEL REGION...AND WEST TN AS FRONTAL 
FEATURE OVER KY AND MO SLIDES SOUTHWARD DURING THE LATE AFTN AND

PARAMETERS DO INDICATE POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS...WITH HAIL AND WIND THE GREATEST THREAT. SO WILL KEEP 
MENTION OF HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS IN EXISTING FORECAST WITH NO 
CHANGES AT THIS TIME.

IF CONVECTION FIRES UP IN THIS UPSTREAM REGION...IT IS POSSIBLE FOR

THE FRONT WILL CLEAR THE MID SOUTH AND RAIN CHANCES WILL END FOR 
SUNDAY. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
THROUGH MONDAY. ANOTHER FRONT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE AREA 
MONDAY EVENING. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD AND 
ALONG WITH THIS FRONT. 

THE MEAN TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL PERSIST AND EVENTUALLY 
DEEPEN ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. WHILE A RIDGE BUILDS OUT WEST. THE 
SURFACE PATTERN FOR THE NEXT WEEK WILL BE CONDUCIVE TO HIGH 
HUMIDITIES AND AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

UPPER TROUGH IS NEARING THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER AS OF 20Z. DIURNALLY 
AIDED CONVECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TROUGH AND THIS SHOULD 
DIMINISH EARLY THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...OVER SOUTHWEST MISSOURI AND 
NORTHWEST ARKANSAS AN OLD MCV IS MOVING THROUGH THE REGION. 
CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED IN THIS AREA IN RESPONSE TO THIS VORT. 18Z 
RUC AND ETA SHOW THIS VORT GETTING CAUGHT UP IN THE WAKE OF THE 
UPPER SHORTWAVE AND ACTUALLY TURNING SOUTHEASTWARD SOMEWHAT. AS A 
RESULT...SEE SOME PLAUSIBILITY IN THE 18Z MESOETA SOLN. EXPECT A 
BROKEN LINE OF STORMS TO ENTER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AROUND 00Z AND 
CONTINUE A SOUTHWARD DEVELOPMENT AS IT MOVES EASTWARD ACROSS THE 
REGION. THINK THAT CONVECTION WITH THE VORT SHOULD BE OVER ACROSS 
EXTREME WEST TN AND EAST ARKANSAS THIS EVENING...BUT LINGERING EAST 
FROM JACKSON TN TO CLARKSDALE MS AFTER MIDNIGHT. 

A STATIONARY FRONT WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE REGION ON FRIDAY LEAVING 
THE REGION IN AN UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH HEAT OF THE DAY VARIETY 
THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED. BY FRIDAY NIGHT...UPPER RIDGE ALONG THE GULF 
COAST WILL SHIFT WESTWARD AND ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL APPROACH THE 
REGION. THIS WILL ALLOW THE FRONT TO PUSH INTO THE REGION AND 
THROUGH THE REGION BY SATURDAY EVENING. THE DRIVING FORCE WITH THE 
FRONT APPEARS TO BE CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES RUNNING ALONG THE FRONT 
LAYING OUT COLD POOLS AND THE SHIFTING OF THE UPPER RIDGE. EXPECT 
ANOTHER COMPLEX TOMORROW AFTERNOON TO DEVELOP OVER SOUTHWEST 
MISSOURI AND MOVE INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS DURING THE AFTERNOON. 
THERE IS A SEVERE THREAT WITH THIS ANTICIPATED COMPLEX...MAINLY WIND 
AND LARGE HAIL. THE COMPLEX SHOULD DIMINISH TOMORROW EVENING SO THE 
SEVERE THREAT SHOULD BE MAINLY CONFINED TO NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS...TIMING IS EVERYTHING. MODELS DIFFER IN POSITION OF THE 
FRONT FOR SATURDAY WITH THE GFS A BIT SLOWER. GOING WITH HIGHER POPS 
OVER NORTH MS SINCE WITH EITHER SOLN THEY WOULD HAVE A SHOT AT 
RAIN...WHEREAS WEST TN AND NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WOULD BE BEHIND THE 
FRONT ACCORDING TO THE ETA SOLN.

THE MODELS NOW CONSISTENTLY TAKE THE FRONT OUT OF THE REGION FOR 
SUNDAY. HOWEVER...THERE IS NOT A GREAT DEAL OF COLD AIR BEHIND THE 
FRONT...TEMPS NEAR NORMAL WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 60S FOR SUNDAY INTO 
MONDAY. THE FRONT MOVES BACK NORTH THROUGH THE REGION ON MONDAY AS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES NORTH OF THE AREAS. THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS ON MONDAY. A STATIONARY FRONT WILL BE LAID 
OUT IN THE WAKE OF THE LOW JUST NORTH OF THE REGION. MOST OF THE 
AREA WILL SEE AIR MASS VARIETY STORMS THE REMAINDER OF THE 
WEEK...KEEPING HIGHER POPS OVER NORTHEAST AR AND NORTHWEST TN DUE TO 
PROXIMITY TO STATIONARY FRONT. NO BIG SURGES OF WARM AIR 
EXPECTED...SO TEMPS AFTER MONDAY SHOULD BE NEAR OR JUST ABOVE NORM.

GENERAL OVERALL UPPER FLOW ACROSS THE U.S. WAS ZONAL. A WEAK AREA OF 
HIGH PRESSURE WAS STRETCHED ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST WITH THE FASTER 
FLOW LOCATED ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY. A BROAD 
TROUGH NORTH OF THE GREAT LAKES WILL HELP PRODUCE THUNDERSTORMS 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT AND AGAIN ON 
MONDAY.

THE FIRST SHORTWAVE PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TONIGHT. 
ALSO THE MCS OVER EASTERN KANSAS WILL MOVE INTO MISSOURI TODAY. THE 
COMBINATION OF BOTH OF THESE FEATURES WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT THROUGH 
THE MID SOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...PLENTIFUL 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL CAUSE A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS TODAY ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA 
WITH THE THREAT OF LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS POSSIBLE. SEE 
SWODY1 FOR MORE DETAILS.

THE FRONT WILL CLEAR THE MID SOUTH AND RAIN CHANCES WILL END FOR 
SUNDAY. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
THROUGH MONDAY. ANOTHER FRONT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE AREA 
MONDAY EVENING. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD AND

AN UPPER SHORTWAVE OVER AR WILL MOVE EWD ACROSS OUR CWA TODAY. THIS 
WILL PROVIDE A GOOD CHANCE OF SHWRS/TSTMS TODAY ALONG WITH PLENTY OF 
CLOUDS. INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK AND SHEAR LOW...SO DO NOT EXPECT 
THESE STORMS TO BE SEVERE.

A SFC AND UPPER HIGH NEAR THE GULF COAST WILL BE THE DOMINATE FEATURE
ON FRIDAY...PROVIDING HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS AND A CHC OF PM 
TSTMS. THE HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY WITH 
TSTM CHCS A LITTLE HIGHER.

A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NW LATE SATURDAY AND MOVE 
THROUGH MOST OF THE CWA SAT NITE. GFS INCONSISTENT WITH PROGRESSION 
OF THE FRONT BUT IT CLOSER TO ETA ON CURRENT RUNS BY BRINGING IT 
THROUGH THE CWA. NOT SURE IF THE FRONT WILL MAKE IT TO CNTRL MS/AL 
SUNDAY...BUT WILL COVER IT IN THE FCST AS A MODIFIED FRONTAL PASSAGE 
WITH SLIGHT DROPS IN THE TEMP/DWPT SUNDAY AND A TEMPORARY BREAK IN 
TSTM CHCS.

A SUBTROPICAL HIGH DEVELOPS OVER THE SE STATES NEXT WEEK...SO EXPECT

UPPER LOW OVER EASTERN PORTION OF TEXAS BEGINNING TO LIFT NORTHWARD 
INTO UPPER TROUGH THAT EXTENDS FROM WESTERN MISSOURI THROUGH WESTERN 
ARKANSAS. UPPER JET OVER NORTHERN HALF OF THE REGION SUPPRESSED 
MORNING CONVECTION OVER WEST TN AND NORTHEAST AR. THIS JET IS NOW 
BEGINNING TO MOVE NORTH OF THE REGION...WITH CONVECTION FOLLOWING 
BEHIND IT IN ITS ENTRANCE REGION. 

EXPECT SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHWARD THIS 
EVENING AS THE UPPER JET EXITS THE AREA. THEN AFTER MIDNIGHT THE 
UPPER TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE AREA. GIVEN THE INSTABILITY IN PLACE 
THIS SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT FOR CHANCES OF RAIN TO CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS. THE TROUGH WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA TOMORROW INTO EARLY TOMORROW NIGHT. THIS SHOULD 
CONTINUE GOOD CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. A TRAILING 
SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL STALL NORTH OF THE REGION. 
THE FRONT WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE REGION FOR FRIDAY WITH ONLY 
DIURNAL CONVECTION EXPECTED. 

GFS DOES NOT HAVE ANY RUN TO RUN CONTINUITY PAST FRIDAY. THE 00Z RUN 
STALLED THE FRONT OUT NORTH OF THE REGION WHILE THE 12Z RUN BRINGS 
THE FRONT CLEAR THROUGH THE REGION. SINCE MOST FRONTS FAIL TO 
ACTUALLY MOVE THROUGH THE ENTIRE REGION THIS TIME OF YEAR...PREFER A 
COMPROMISE OF THE TWO SOLUTIONS...BRINGS THE FRONT INTO WEST TN 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. STALLS IT OVER WEST TN SUNDAY. THEN 
LIFTS IT NORTH OF THE REGION MONDAY ONWARD. KEEPING LOW CHANCE POPS

UPPER LOW OVER EAST TEXAS IS BEGINNING TO LIFT NORTHWARD ALONG AN 
UPPER TROUGH THAT IS POSITIONED OVER WESTERN MISSOURI AND WESTERN 
ARKANSAS. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER JET MOVING NORTHWARD 
THROUGH CENTRAL AND EASTERN ARKANSAS. DESCENT INSTABILITY IS IN 
PLACE OVER THE REGION WITH LIS AROUND -4 TO -5 AND CAPES AROUND 2500 
J/KG. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ALREADY DEVELOPED OVER WEST TN 
AND NORTH MS WITH SUBSIDENCE FROM THE UPPER JET DELAYING CONVECTION 
OVER EAST ARKANSAS. A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER 
LOUISIANA AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND ARE MOVING TOWARDS THE 
NORTH-NORTHEAST IN RESPONSE TO THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER JET. 
THE ENTRANCE REGION WILL MOVE OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON 
WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FOR DEVELOPMENT THERE. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO 
NUMEROUS EVERYWHERE WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS OVER WEST TN AND NORTH 
MISSISSIPPI WHERE CONVECTION IS ONGOING. 

LCL HEIGHTS ON BOTH MESOETA MODEL SOUNDINGS THROUGHOUT THE REGION 
AND LZK/OHX 12Z SOUNDINGS ARE FAIRLY HIGH...AROUND 3000FT. 0-3KM 
SHEAR NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE...AROUND 50 M2/S2. KNQA-88D SHOWING VAD 
1KM WINDS OUT OF THE SOUTH-SOUTHWEST AT 15 KTS WITH SFC WINDS 
SOUTHWESTERLY AT ABOUT 10KTS. SO THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A GREAT

A WEAK TROPICAL LOW CENTERED OVER SW AR WILL DISSIPATE LATER TODAY. 
AN UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER ERN TX WILL BECOME AN OPEN WAVE THIS 
AFTERNOON ACROSS WRN AR/LA. EXPECT NUMEROUS SHWRS/TSTMS NEAR THIS 
SYSTEM. AS A RESULT...THE WRN PART OF THE CWA WILL HAVE HIGHER POPS 
THAN THE E. LOW CLOUDS ARE DEVELOPING IN MANY AREAS EARLY THIS 
MORNING. EXPECT LOTS OF CLOUDS AROUND TODAY DUE TO AMPLE TROPICAL 
MOISTURE IN PLACE COMBINED WITH THE UPPER SHORTWAVE TO THE WEST.

THE UPPER SHORTWAVE PROGRESSES EWD ACROSS THE LWR MS VLY REGION LATE 
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. THE ENTIRE CWA WILL HAVE A DECENT CHC OF 
SHWRS/TSTMS FROM THIS SYSTEM ON THURSDAY.

A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE CWA FROM THE N FRI...BECOMING 
STATIONARY JUST ALONG THE N BORDER...THEN MOVE NWD AS A WARM FRONT 
SATURDAY. PREFER THE CONSERVATIVE GFS SOLUTION BY KEEPING THE FRONT 
TO THE N. A BLOCKING SUBTROPICAL HIGH WILL BECOME ESTABLISHED AGAIN

REGIONAL RADAR IMAGERY AND SURFACE OBS THIS AFTERNOON PLACES SURFACE 
LOW NEAR TUNICA MS. AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS LOCATED OVER EAST TX AND 
AN UPPER SHORTWAVE IS MOVING ACROSS THE MIDWEST. AS OF 19Z...MAIN 
BAND OF RAIN EXTENDS ROUGHLY ALONG INTERSTATE 40. THIS BAND IS 
MAINLY DUE TO UPPER JET PUNCHING UP FROM THE SOUTH. SOUTH OF THIS 
BAND...SOLAR HEATING HAS RESULTED IN SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSHOWERS IN WHAT WOULD OTHERWISE BE A DRY SLOT. EXPECT THE 
MAIN BAND OF RAIN TO MOVE NORTH OF THE REGION BY 00Z. AREAL COVERAGE 
OF CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH ALTHOUGH WOULDNT BE SURPRISED TO SEE A 
FEW SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS PERSIST OVERNIGHT DUE TO GOOD UPPER 
LIFT OVER REGION. THINK PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES SOUTH OF THE MAIN BAND 
FOR A LITTLE WHILE THIS EVENING...THEN SKIES BECOMING CLOUDY 
EVERYWHERE WITH LOW-LEVEL STRATUS DEVELOPING.

SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSING THE MIDWEST WILL PICK UP THE UPPER LOW 
OVER TX AND BEGIN TO SLOWLY LIFT IT OUT ON WEDNESDAY. THE MAIN 
TROUGH AXIS AND THUS THE BETTER CHANCES FOR CONVECTION SHOULD STAY 
OUT OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS. HOWEVER...DESCENT INSTABILITY WITH CAPES 
AROUND 1000-1500 J/KG AND LIS AROUND -2/-3 ALONG WITH HUMID AIR MASS 
IN PLACE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT TO POP SOME THUNDERSHOWERS DURING THE 
DAY. EXPECT MORNING CLOUD COVER TO GIVE WAY TO A FEW PEAKS OF SUN BY 
LATE MORNING. SO HAVE BUMPED TEMPS UP A COUPLE OF DEGREES...MID TO 
UPPER 80S. 

ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO MOVE 
THROUGH THE REGION. WITH ONLY DESCENT INSTABILITY AND A GOOD AMOUNT 
OF CLOUDS PRESENT...EXPECT SCATTERED CONVECTION AS THE TROUGH MOVES 
THROUGH. MEANWHILE A SECOND SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
BE MOVING INTO SOUTHWEST MISSOURI AND TOWARDS THE REGION. 

AFTER 60HRS...ETA AND GFS DIFFER IN SOLUTIONS. THE ETA BRINGS THE 
FRONT THROUGH THE REGION WHILE THE GFS STALLS IT OUT OVER EXTREME 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS AND EXTREME NORTHWEST TENNESSEE. THE GFS RUN HAS 
BEEN RELATIVELY CONSISTENT SO AM LEANING TOWARDS ITS SOLUTION. THIS 
KEEPS MOST OF THE REGION IN THE WARM SECTOR FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
WITH MAINLY SCATTERED AFTERNOON CONVECTION POSSIBLE. GFS IS MUCH 
WARMER GOING INTO THE WEEKEND WITH 850 TEMPS AS HIGH AS +20. WITH 
FULL SUN THIS WOULD TRANSLATE INTO MID 90S FOR HIGHS. HAVE TRENDED 
TOWARDS THE WARMER SOLUTION ALTHOUGH WAITING FOR MORE CONSISTENCY 
BEFORE BITING TOO MUCH INTO THIS SOLUTION. GFS BRINGS A SECOND FRONT 
THROUGH SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY. GIVEN TIME OF YEAR AND 
STRENGTH OF UPPER HIGH OVER GULF COAST THINK THAT FRONT WILL STALL 
OUT SOMEWHERE AROUND THE MIDSOUTH. STILL SHOULD ACT AS A FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTION.
