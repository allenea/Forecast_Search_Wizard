1000 PM EST SUN DEC 31 2006

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENTLY...
SKIES ARE MOSTLY TO PARTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE KEYS WITH NOT NEARLY AS 
MUCH CUMULUS AS PREVIOUS EVENINGS. TEMPERATURES ARE STEADY IN THE 
MID 70S WITH EAST SOUTHEAST WINDS 10 TO 15 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS 
OVER THE ISLANDS. KBYX RADAR INDICATES WEAKENING SHOWERS IN A BAND 
EXTENDING NORTHWEST FROM HAVANA. SOME OF THESE SHOWERS PRODUCED 
LIGHTNING A COUPLE HOURS AGO.

FORECASTS...
EVENING SOUNDING SHOWS A LITTLE MORE ROOM FOR PARCELS TO BUBBLE UP 
GIVEN CAPE ABOVE 800 J/KG...BUT BELIEVE THE GREATEST INSTABILITY 
WILL BE AVAILABLE OVER WARMER GULF STREAM WATERS AND MAINLY WEST OF 
KEY WEST. DEEP TROUGH MAKING PAINFULLY SLOW PROGRESS EASTWARD INTO 
THE GULF OF MEXICO WITH MAIN TROUGH AXIS STILL BACK ACROSS TEXAS. 
CLOUDS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF LIKELY TO ONLY 
AFFECT NORTH PARTS OF THE PENINSULA OVERNIGHT. OTHERWISE THE SURFACE 
RIDGE IN THE WEST ATLANTIC HOLDS ITS POSITION WITH CONTINUING 
MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH EAST/SOUTHEAST WINDS OVER THE 
STRAITS. NO CHANGES TO PUBLIC ZONES WITH MORE SPRINKLES AND A FEW 
BRIEF LIGHT SHOWERS POSSIBLY CROSSING THE KEYS FROM THE WARMER 
STRAITS.

&&

.MARINE...
NO CMAN PLATFORM DATA THE PAST FEW HOURS...BUT A CHECK WITH THE KEY 
WEST USCG GROUP INDICATED SOME EAST WINDS MEASURED JUST SHY OF 
20 KNOTS AND SEAS MUCH LOWER THAN THE ERRONEOUS 13 FEET REPORTED BY 
A COMMERCIAL VESSEL EARLIER THIS EVENING. THIS WARRANTS HOLDING THE 
EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINE FOR THE STRAITS OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...THERE 
IS GOOD NEWS FOR THE POWER BOATERS WITH GUIDANCE CONTINUING TO LOCK 
IN ON A DECREASE IN WIND SPEEDS BEGINNING NEW YEARS DAY...POSSIBLY 
EVEN DECREASING TO BELOW 10 KNOTS TEMPORARILY BY EVENING. EAST WINDS 
WILL RESUME AND BECOME OCCASIONALLY MODERATE IN SPEEDS BY 
WEDNESDAY...ESPECIALLY OVER THE STRAITS. 

&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL DOMINATE THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT  
ROUTE AND THE KEYS TERMINALS THROUGH TONIGHT. PATCHES OF VFR TO HIGH 
MVFR CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE ROUTE TONIGHT. IN 
ADDITION...A FEW SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED...ESPECIALLY OVER THE MARINE 
PORTION OF THE ROUTE.

&&

.CLIMATE...
AS WITH THE SATURDAY EVENING FORECAST...THE RECORD LOW MENTION IN 
THE PUBLIC ZONES REFERS TO THE MAX-MINIMUM RECORDS...THE HIGHEST 
RECORDED LOW TEMPERATURE VALUE FOR THE DATE. FOR NEW YEARS 
DAY...THESE RECORDS ARE ONCE AGAIN 75F AT KEY WEST AIRPORT AND 74F 
AT TAVERNIER. AT THIS TIME...THESE RECORDS MAY HOLD UP IF WINDS 
DECREASE MONDAY EVENING...ALLOWING THE TEMPERATURE TO DROP BELOW 
THOSE VALUES.  FOR THOSE FOLLOWING ALONG WITH THE DECEMBER 31ST 
MAX-MINIMUM RECORDS...KEY WEST IS LIKELY TO TIE THE VALUE OF 75F. A 
RECORD REPORT...AS WELL AS THE MONTHLY (MIACLMKEY) AND ANNUAL 
(MIAPNSKEY) SUMMARIES ARE SCHEDULED TO BE ISSUED OVERNIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...
OBSERVATIONS...
TEMPERATURES CLIMBED TO AROUND 80 ON THE ISLANDS AFTER MORNING LOWS 
AROUND 75...A TYPICAL EARLY MAY DAY. WINDS HAVE BEEN MAINLY FROM THE 
EAST AROUND 20 KNOTS ON THE REEF AT THE C-MAN STATIONS...10 TO 15 
MPH ON LAND...WITH HIGHER GUSTS DURING SHOWERS. WE RACKED UP TWO 
HUNDREDTHS AT KEY WEST AND A TRACE AT MARATHON. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
HIGH PRESSURE IS HOLDING IN THE ATLANTIC...FOR NOW. THE FLOW AROUND 
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH IS SENDING POTENT HIGH-THETA-E AIR 
TOWARD WEST FLORIDA WHERE A LOW PRESSURE AREA IS DEEPENING AND A 
LINE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS HAS SET UP. LIFT WITHIN THESE 
SOUTHERLIES OCCASIONALLY CREATES LAYERED CLOUDS IN OUR SERVICE 
AREA...BUT THESE ARE THIN AND SHORT-LIVED SO FAR ACCORDING TO 
SATELLITE.
&&

.FORECASTS...
GUIDANCE HAS BEEN PRETTY CONSISTENT ON THE FATE OF THE GULF-LOW. IT 
SHOULD LIFT OUT TOWARD THE NORTHEAST AND IN ITS WAKE SEND A COOL 
FRONT SOUTHWARD DOWN THE PENINSULA. WE FOLLOWED THE GFS WHICH STALLS 
THE FRONT TO OUR NORTH MONDAY EVENING. THIS WILL ALLOW THE WARM 
WEATHER TO CONTINUE HERE IN THE ISLANDS. WE EXPECT ONLY A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN CLOUD FRACTION AND RAIN CHANCES. WIND SPEEDS WILL DROP 
WAY OFF DURING THIS INTERVAL.

FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK WE WILL AGAIN COME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF 
THE ATLANTIC HIGH...SUSTAINED BY RIDGING AND WARM AIR ALOFT...SO 
MORE PLEASANT WEATHER IS IN STORE FOR US. THIS WINTER IS TURNING OUT 
TO BE QUITE MILD. 
&&

.MARINE...
WE HAVE RETAINED A CAUTIONARY STATEMENT FOR THE ATLANTIC SIDE 
TONIGHT. ALTHOUGH WIND SPEEDS ARE DROPPING WE WILL CONTINUE TO SEE 
AT LEAST 15 KNOTS FOR THE NEXT 6 HOURS. RESIDUAL SEAS TO 6 FEET OR 
MORE BEYOND THE REEF WILL TAKE TIME TO SETTLE DOWN. WE HAD A SHIP 
REPORT AT 18Z (2PM) ABOUT 10 MILES SOUTH OF SAND KEY LIGHT CLAIMING 
COMBINED SEAS OF 10FT BUT THIS SEEMED HIGH. IN ANY CASE USE CAUTION 
ON YOUR SUNSET SAIL.
&&

.AVIATION...
LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR TONIGHT ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW ROUTE 
IN BRIEF LIGHT SHOWERS.  MOST TOPS WILL BE AT OR BELOW FL100.  THE 
SHOWERS WILL BE MOVING RAPIDLY...SO EXPECT GUSTY CONDITIONS NEAR 
THEM.  

.CLIMATE...
TODAY IN KEYS WEATHER HISTORY...
ON DECEMBER 31 1986 THE KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT RECEIVED 1.35 
INCHES OF RAIN...BRINGING THE TOTAL FOR THE MONTH TO 11.18 INCHES. 
THIS WAS THE WETTEST DECEMBER ON RECORD IN KEY WEST.

WE WILL COMPILE THE SUMMARY FOR DECEMBER -- AND 2006 AS A WHOLE -- 
TONIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...
OBSERVATIONS...
IT WAS WARM THIS MORNING WITH SUNRISE TEMPERATURES AROUND 75F. THIS 
WILL EQUAL THE RECORD HIGH MINIMUM FOR TODAY...DEPENDING ON WHAT 
HAPPENS THIS EVENING BEFORE MIDNIGHT WHEN THE SHOE DROPS. EARLY-LOOK 
VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWED A FIELD OF CUMULUS IN THE STRAITS...AND OUR 
RADAR PICKED UP A FEW RETURNS MOSTLY IN THE OPEN OCEAN WITH MOVEMENT 
TOWARD THE NORTHWEST.

SURFACE WINDS WERE FROM THE SOUTHEAST AND VARIED QUITE A BIT. ON THE 
REEF AT THE C-MAN STATIONS SPEEDS WERE SUSTAINED BETWEEN 15 AND 22 
KNOTS...WHILE THE LAND STATIONS REPORTED 8 TO 16 KNOTS. A RECENT 
SHIP REPORT NEAR COSGROVE SHOAL GAVE US 17 KNOTS AND 5-FOOT SEAS 
WHICH SEEMED LIKE GOOD AVERAGE VALUES. WE NEED MORE OF THESE.

OUR MORNING SOUNDING WAS ESSENTIALLY UNCHANGED FROM THAT OF 
YESTERDAY...WITH EASTERLIES THROUGH ABOUT 3 KILOMETERS OVERLAIN BY 
WESTERLIES WITH AN INVERSION AT THE SHEAR HEIGHT. THUS THE CUMULI 
WILL BE LIMITED IN VERTICAL EXTENT. GIVEN THEIR SPEED OF MOTION -- 
25 KNOTS -- ANY RAIN THAT FALLS WILL BE VERY LIGHT AND OF BRIEF 
DURATION.  
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE ATLANTIC HIGH CONTINUES ROBUST AND IS DELIVERING THE EASTERLY 
AIR. WE COULD ANALYZE A LOCAL RIDGE AXIS IN THE EASTERN STRAITS FROM 
ABOUT BIMINI TO CAY SAL ON OUR MORNING MESO-PLOT. LOW PRESSURE IS 
EVIDENT NEAR THE MOUTH OF MISSISSIPPI RIVER WITH A GOOD INFLOW OF 
HIGH THETA-E AIR IN THE EASTERN GULF -- TD AT THE EAST GULF BUOY WAS 
76F AT 13Z. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE GULF-LOW WILL TRACK TOWARD THE NORTHEAST TODAY AND HELP TO 
WEAKEN THE ATLANTIC HIGH AS IT DOES SO. THUS THE OBSERVED TREND OF 
LOWER WIND SPEEDS AT DRY TORTUGAS COMPARED TO MOLASSES REEF. THE 
MOIST AIRFLOW NOTED ABOVE GENERATED SOME LAYERED CLOUDS OVERNIGHT 
BUT THIS PROCESS WILL REMAIN WEAK LOCALLY ACCORDING TO OUR 
GUIDANCE...WHICH GOES ALONG WITH WHAT WE SEE ON SATELLITE SO FAR. 

ALL THINGS CONSIDERED WE PLAN NO UPDATE TO OUR LAND ZONES...AND WILL 
MAKE ONLY COSMETIC CHANGES IN OUR UPCOMING ROUTINE ISSUANCE OF THE 
MARINE ZONES.
&&

.MARINE...
IT IS MARGINAL EITHER WAY FOR AN ADVISORY IN THE ATLANTIC TODAY. 
GIVEN PRESENT TRENDS WE WILL MAINTAIN THE CAUTIONARY STATEMENT. THE 
BAY...THE BACK COUNTRY AND THE GULF SIDE WILL BE SOMEWHAT SHELTERED 
AND MAY BE YOUR BEST BET FOR RECREATIONAL BOATING TODAY. IF YOU GO 
OUTSIDE THAT CAUTION IS FOR YOU.
&&

.AVIATION...
LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR TODAY ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW ROUTE IN 
BRIEF LIGHT SHOWERS.  MOST TOPS WILL BE AT OR BELOW FL100.  THE 
SHOWERS WILL BE MOVING RAPIDLY...SO EXPECT GUSTY CONDITIONS NEAR 
THEM.  

.CLIMATE...
TODAY IN KEYS WEATHER HISTORY...
ON DECEMBER 31 1986 THE KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT RECEIVED 1.35 
INCHES OF RAIN...BRINGING THE TOTAL FOR THE MONTH TO 11.18 INCHES. 
THIS WAS THE WETTEST DECEMBER ON RECORD IN KEY WEST. IN COMPARISON 
ONLY 4.80 INCHES OF RAIN WAS RECORDED IN KEY WEST IN DECEMBER 2006 
(THROUGH THE 30TH)...WHICH IS STILL WELL ABOVE THE NORMAL RAINFALL 
OF 2.14 INCHES FOR THE MONTH OF DECEMBER.

.DISCUSSION...
OBSERVATIONS/TRENDS...
WARM AND HUMID EASTERLY BREEZES REMAIN LARGELY UNABATED EARLY THIS 
MORNING. A LARGE, COLD HIGH PRESSURE AREA CENTERED OVER NEW ENGLAND 
HAS EXPANDED SOUTHWARD OVER THE ATLANTIC...REINFORCING THE 
PRE-EXISTING HIGH PRESSURE THAT EXTENDS SOUTH TO THE BAHAMAS. THE 
COLD FRONT THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEW ENGLAND HIGH PRESSURE 
AREA REMAINS FAR TO OUR NORTH. KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE BEEN RATHER 
CLOSE TO 20 KT WITH HIGHER GUSTS OVERNIGHT...BUT LATEST C-MAN 
OBSERVATIONS ON THE REEF SHOW 10-METER SUSTAINED WINDS 14-19 KT...
BUT GUSTS AREA STILL UP TO 26 KT. WINDS ARE DRIVEN BY THE ATLANTIC 
HIGH PRESSURE. ISLAND TEMPERATURES HAVE REMAINED IN THE MID 70S 
OVERNIGHT...AND DEWPOINTS ARE NEAR 70F. SIMILAR TO THE PAST FEW 
NIGHTS...SMALL LOW-TOPPED SHOWERS HAVE FORMED OVER THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS...WITH SPOTTY SHOWERS MAKING TO AND ACROSS A FEW ISLANDS. 

AN ODD APPARENTLY LOW LEVEL CYCLONIC SWIRL IS SEEN ON IR SATELLITE 
ABOUT 300 MILES NE OF NASSAU, BAHAMAS, MOVING WEST. THERE APPEARS TO 
BE A WEAK TROUGH WITHIN THE HIGH-PRESSURE-DRIVEN EASTERLIES.

FORECASTS...
THE WARM AND HUMID PERIOD OF WEATHER IS STILL EXPECTED TO PERSIST 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE FIRST WEEK OF 2007. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE 
BEING MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS IN THE MORNING PACKAGE. 

TODAY THROUGH MONDAY...A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE 
ATLANTIC IS FORECAST TO GRADUALLY SHIFT SOUTHWARD WITH A RIDGE AXIS 
EXTENDING WEST TO SOUTH FLORIDA BY LATE MONDAY. A TURN OF WINDS TO 
SE WITH SPEEDS GRADUALLY COMING DOWN SHOULD BE SEEN LATE TONIGHT AND 
MORE NOTICEABLY MONDAY. THE 500 MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTER TO OUR EAST 
IS STILL SHOWN BY MODELS TO SCOOT FARTHER AWAY TO THE EAST...WITH
SOME INCREASE IN SW WINDS ALOFT OVER THE KEYS. MAIN WEATHER PATTERNS 
EMBEDDED WITHIN THE WESTERLIES STILL ARE EXPECTED TO PASS WELL TO 
OUR NORTH...ALTHOUGH WE MAY SEE SOME INCREASE IN CIRRUS CLOUD COVER 
MONDAY. ONLY 10 PCT POPS WILL BE RETAINED.

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...A WEAK FRONT IS STILL SHOWN BY 
MODELS TO STALL SOMEWHERE OVER SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA AND THE SE GULF 
OF MEXICO...REMAINING NORTH OF THE KEYS. A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH SOUTH 
OF THE FRONT IS SHOWN TO SET UP OVER THE KEYS LATE MON NIGHT AND 
TUE...WHICH COULD TURN LOCAL WINDS TO NE TO E FOR A WHILE...WITH
SPEEDS NOT VERY STRONG...SAY 10 MPH. BAROCLINIC ZONES ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE DYING FRONT WILL STAY NORTH OF THE KEYS...AND THUS LOCAL 
TEMPERATURES WILL NOT REALLY DO ANY COOLING. WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
TUESDAY GIVING PW VALUES UP TO 1.5 INCH...AND IF THE WINDS GO ENE IN 
THE WARM AFTERNOON...THEN CU/TCU LINES MAY FORM OVER KEYS ISLANDS.
A FEW SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE BUT LACK OF REALLY DEEP MOISTURE MAKES 20 
PCT POPS STILL REASONABLE FOR TUE. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...THE 500 MB HIGH IS FORECAST TO 
BUILD BACK WEST OVER THE BAHAMAS AND CUBA CLOSER TO THE KEYS. THE
STALLED SURFACE FRONT OVER SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA IS SHOWN BY MODELS 
TO RETREAT AWAY TO THE NORTH...LEAVING THE KEYS IN A WARM E TO SE 
SURFACE FLOW. SOME INCREASE IN WIND SPEEDS MAY BE SEEN WED AND THU 
AS THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE BUILDS A BIT. I CANT SEE
ANY LARGE SCALE WEATHER MAKERS IN THE VICINITY...JUST SOME SMALL 
SCALE SHOWERS. 

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS HAS A WEAK FRONT REACHING 
THE KEYS MAYBE SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT WELL NEED TO SEE LATER MODEL 
RUNS BEFORE THIS IS BELIEVABLE. A WEAK 500 MB TROUGH (A LITTLE 
BETTER DEFINED AT 250 MB) IS SHOWN TO PASS OVER THE KEYS LATE 
FRIDAY. THE GFS SHOWS A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH HAVING BEEN LEFT BEHIND 
WELL TO OUR NORTH OVER FLORIDA AND THE GULF...SO IMPACT IF ANY OF 
THIS UPPER TROUGH IS NOT CLEAR. IF IT MATERIALIZES IT MAY REPRESENT
A FADING LINE OF SHOWERS OR NOTHING. 
&&

.MARINE...
HIGH PRESSURE IS STILL PUMPING EAST WINDS 15-20 KT WITH GUSTS TO 25 
KT OVER THE AREA THIS MORNING...CLOSER TO 15 KT AND GUSTY ON BAY AND 
GULF WATERS. A SLOW DECLINE IN WIND SPEEDS IS SEEN FOR LATE TONIGHT 
AND MONDAY...WITH WINDS TURNING MORE SE. AN INTERLUDE OF LIGHTER 
WINDS (10 KT ON MOST WATERS BUT 10-15 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS) IS 
EXPECTED LATE MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. EAST WINDS PICKING UP NEAR 15 
KT WEDNESDAY IS EXPECTED DUE TO SOME REBUILDING OF ATLANTIC HIGH 
PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS WILL AFFECT THE 
ROUTE...ESPECIALLY THE KEYS PORTION THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. 
A FEW SMALL SHOWERS WILL ALSO TRAVERSE THE KEYS PORTION OF THE ROUTE 
THIS MORNING BUT THESE SHOULD BE TOO BRIEF AND LIGHT TO PRODUCE 
FLIGHT RESTRICTIONS. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 KT WITH OCCASIONAL HIGHER GUSTS.

OBSERVATIONS/TRENDS...
PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES COVER THE KEYS PRESENTLY AS A LARGE 
PATCH OF STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS DEVELOPED. TEMPERATURES ARE 
STEADY...IN THE MID 70S...AND EAST WINDS CONTINUE AT 10 TO 15 MPH 
WITH OCCASIONAL HIGHER GUSTS. KBYX NOW INDICATING SPRINKLES OR VERY 
LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS MOVING TOWARD THE WEST-NORTHWEST WITHIN THE 
STRATOCUMULUS DECK...MAINLY AFFECTING THE THE UPPER KEYS AT THIS

FORECASTS...
SURFACE WINDS SEEM TO BE RUNNING CLOSER TO THE 18Z GFS MOS THAN THE 
12Z ETA MOS. HOWEVER...WINDS HAVE FRESHENED AT PENNEKAMP STATE PARK 
AND MOLASSES REEF WITH GUSTS TO 20 MPH. THEREFORE WILL LEAVE THE 
FORECAST AS IS...WITH SPRINKLES OR A VERY LIGHT SHOWER PASSING FROM 
TIME TO TIME. GFS INDICATES GENERAL DECREASE IN MOISTURE AT THE 305K 
ISENTROPIC LEVEL...IN SPITE OF MINOR LIFT ACROSS FLORIDA BAY AS THE 
EAST/SOUTHEAST FLOW MUST NEGOTIATE OVER THE COOLER FLORIDA BAY/GULF 
AIRMASS. STATOCUMULUS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS IS LIKELY TO ERODE 
SOMEWHAT DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. JUST A NOTE...THE RECORD 
LOW TEMPERATURE WORDING REFERS TO THE RECORD MAX-MIN TEMPERATURES 
FOR DECEMBER 31ST...WHICH MAY BE TIED WITH THE MOIST BOUNDARY LEVEL 
AND STEADY EAST/SOUTHEAST WINDS. PLEASE SEE THE CLIMATE SECTION 
BELOW FOR SPECIFICS.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
TEMPERATURES CLIMBED INTO THE LOWER 80S THIS AFTERNOON UNDER PARTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES...AND A FEW SPRINKLES WERE SHOWING UP ON RADAR. 
SUSTAINED WINDS WERE FROM THE EAST AROUND 15 MPH ON LAND...20 KNOTS 
AT THE C-MAN PLATFORMS WITH A FEW HIGHER GUSTS. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE EASTERLIES ARE COURTESY OF A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE CELL BUILDING 
INTO THE ATLANTIC OFF THE CAROLINA CAPES. THIS FEATURE WILL REMAIN 
IN CONTROL OF OUR WEATHER THROUGH THIS FORECAST CYCLE. IT IS 
SUSTAINED BY RIDGING ALOFT WHICH IS PROVING TO BE VERY SUMMER-LIKE 
IN ITS PERSISTENCE. THE RIDGING IS LIMITING TOTAL COLUMN MOISTURE 
AND ITS ASSOCIATED SUBSIDENCE IS PROVIDING HIGH VALUES OF STATIC 
STABILITY. THUS...EVEN THOUGH OUR EASTERLIES EXIST THROUGH SEVERAL 
KILOMETERS WE SEE SCATTERED CLOUDS WITH LIMITED VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT.
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE RIDGING OVER THE OCEAN IS BEING WEAKENED GRADUALLY BY A TROF 
ALOFT MOVING THROUGH THE MIDWEST AND TRACKING TOWARD QUEBEC. THUS WE 
CAN EXPECT OUR WINDS TO DECREASE BY AN INCREMENT FOR THE REST OF THE 
WEEKEND. THE MIDWEST TROF DRIVES A COOL FRONT INTO 
FLORIDA...ACCORDING TO OUR GUIDANCE...WHICH STALLS NEAR LAKE 
OKEECHOBEE MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THIS WILL FURTHER DECREASE OUR WINDS 
WHILE INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES SLIGHTLY. MEANWHILE 
OUR SURFACE WINDS WILL HAVE JUST ENOUGH SOUTH IN THEM TO HELP US TO 
EQUAL OR EXCEED OUR RECORD HIGH MINIMUM TONIGHT (75F). 
&&

.MARINE...
WE INTEND TO DROP OUR ADVISORY FOR THE ATLANTIC TONIGHT. CONDITIONS 
ARE MARGINAL ACCORDING TO ALL AVAILABLE DATA. YOU WILL ENCOUNTER A 
FEW GUSTS ABOVE 20 KNOTS...AND SEAS OVER 6 FEET...IF YOU VENTURE 
WELL BEYOND THE REEF. MEANWHILE EXERCISE CAUTION OUT THERE. OVER THE 
NEXT SIX HOURS ANY RESIDUAL SEAS WILL PROPAGATE OUT OF OUR AREA.

AT THE C-MAN PLATFORMS. RADAR SHOWED WEAK RETURNS WITHIN A FEW OF 
THE CLOUDS...AND WE HAD SEVERAL TRACE-EPISODES OVERNIGHT. 

THE MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED EAST OR SOUTHEAST WINDS IN THE LOWEST 
FEW KILOMETERS WHICH REPRESENTED OUR POTENTIAL HEADROOM. WINDS AT 
1&2 THOUSAND FEET WERE AROUND 25KTS. WINDS SHIFTED FROM EAST TO WEST 
AROUND FOUR KILOMETERS...AND MOISTURE WAS LIMITED ABOVE THIS SHEAR 
HEIGHT.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
OUR MORNING MESO PLOT SHOWS THAT OUR LARGE CONTINENTAL ANTICYCLONE 
CONTINUES TO PREDOMINATE. WITHIN THE EASTERLIES...CLOUDS ARE 
CONTROLLED BY SLIGHT VARIATIONS IN MOISTURE CONTENT...STATIC 
STABILITY AND UNDERLYING WATER TEMPERATURE. THIS IS CLEARLY SHOWN ON 
THE QUICK-LOOK EARLY VISIBLE SATELLITE.

ONE IMPROVEMENT IS THE ABSENCE TODAY OF THE NEARBY BRANCH OF THE

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS/ANALYSIS...
AN ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDING WEST INTO NORTH CAROLINA 
HAS JUST ABOUT LOST ITS IDENTIFIABLE AXIS DUE TO SOUTHWARD BUILDING 
OF ANOTHER HIGH PRESSURE AREA NOW CENTERED OVER NEW ENGLAND. THE 
EXISTING LARGE HIGH PRESSURE THAT EXTENDS SOUTH OVER THE NW ATLANTIC 
TO THE BAHAMAS AND NW CARIBBEAN IS THUS BEING REINFORCED THIS 
MORNING. AS A RESULT...KEYS AREA ATLANTIC-SIDE WINDS REMAIN FROM THE 
EAST 20 KT OR GREATER THIS MORNING. A FEW OVERNIGHT SHIP REPORTS OUT 
IN THE STRAITS INCLUDED SOME WELL-OVER 20 KT REPORTS THAT MAY BE 
ENHANCED DUE TO ANEMOMETER ELEVATION. KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR WIND 
PROFILE HAS CONSISTENTLY MEASURED 1 THSD FT AGL WINDS EAST 20 KT. 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS QUITE DRY AIR ALOFT OVER THE KEYS...AND
GOES SOUNDER DATA INDICATE PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 1.2-1.3 INCH 
OVER AND AROUND THE KEYS. SMALL LOW-TOPPED SHOWERS ARE STILL MOVING 
QUICKLY WEST OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS...AND A FEW HAVE SCRAPED OVER 
KEYS ISLAND LOCATIONS OVERNIGHT WITH TRACE AMOUNTS OF RAIN. IT IS 
WARM WITH KEY WEST TEMPERATURE AT 73F AND MARATHON AT 75F.

.FORECASTS...
WARM WEATHER WITH GENERALLY LOW CHANCES OF RAIN IS STILL EXPECTED TO 
FINISH OUT 2006...AND CONTINUE INTO THE FIRST WEEK OF 2007. LATEST 
MODEL OUTPUT IS CONSISTENT...AND NO CHANGES ARE MADE TO ONGOING 
FORECASTS THROUGH NEXT FRIDAY. 

TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY...A 500 MB HIGH CENTER WILL REMAIN NOT FAR TO 
THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE KEYS...KEEPING WEATHER SYSTEMS EMBEDDED 
WITHIN THE WESTERLIES MOVING OVER AREAS WELL TO THE WEST AND NORTH 
OF THE KEYS. A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL REMAIN LARGE AND 
STRONG OVER THE NW ATLANTIC...PUMPING WARM EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZES 
OVER THE KEYS. THE HIGH MAY BEGIN TO SHIFT SOUTH AND WEAKEN A BIT 
DURING SUNDAY. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY SUPPORT JUST SMALL ISOLATED 
SHOWERS MOVING QUICKLY ON THE BREEZES. NIGHTLY MINIMUM TEMPS MAY 
STAY UP IN THE MID 70S...BUT I WILL INDICATE 73F FOR ISLANDS. 

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...THE 500 MB HIGH IS STILL 
FORECAST TO SHIFT FARTHER AWAY FROM THE KEYS TO THE EAST...AND A BIT 
OF SW FLOW ALOFT WILL SET IN OVERHEAD. FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE 
MORE MOISTURE CONTENT IN THE AIRMASS IN THE LOWER 10 THSD FT.
DURING THIS PERIOD...SURFACE WINDS SHOULD GO SE AND DROP IN SPEED AS 
THIS HIGH PRESSURE AREA WEAKENS OVER THE ATLANTIC. ONLY 20 PCT POPS 
WILL BE CARRIED PER ALL GUIDANCES...WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF LARGE 
SCALE SUPPORT FOR SHOWERS BUT CU/TCU LINES ARE POSSIBLE IN A DEEPER 
SE TO S WIND FLOW. WE MIGHT SE AN INCREASE IN CIRRUS WITH THE ONSET 
OF SW FLOW ALOFT. STILL WARM OF COURSE. 

TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...VARIOUS MODELS AGREE...AND HAVE BEEN 
LARGELY CONSISTENT THROUGH SEVERAL RUNS...SHOWING THE NEXT UPSTREAM 
FRONTAL SYSTEM TO COME TO A HALT AS IT REACHES INTO SOUTH CENTRAL 
FLORIDA TUESDAY. THE MID LEVEL (500 MB) HIGH TO OUR EAST IS SHOWN TO 
BEGIN BUILDING BACK WEST TOWARD THE FLORIDA STRAITS DURING 
WEDNESDAY. IF THERE IS SOME ENHANCED SHOWER ACTION AND HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDINESS TUESDAY...IT MAY GO AWAY WED WITH THE RE-BUILDING UPPER 
RIDGE. MODELS SHOW SOME INCREASE IN SURFACE PRESSURES POKING WEST TO 
SOUTH FLORIDA AS WELL...WHICH MAY TURN AREA WINDS TO E OR ESE WITH A 
PICK UP IN SPEED AGAIN. STILL WARM OF COURSE. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...A 500 MB HIGH IS INDICATED TO AGAIN 
BE LOCATED JUST SOUTH AND EAST OF THE KEYS...SHUNTING WINTER SYSTEMS 
TO OUR WEST AND NORTH. EXTENDED PROGS HAVE ANOTHER BOGGING DOWN 
FRONT JUST GETTING TO THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...BUT CONFIDENCE REMAINS 
LOW AT LONGER PERIODS. STILL WARM IF THATS THE CASE.

.MARINE...
THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN THE FORECAST FOR ATLANTIC 
WATERS TODAY AS LARGE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO KEEP A 
TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE KEYS. A SLIGHT DROP (ONLY 5 KT OR 
SO) IS INDICATED IN ONE MODEL FOR TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT
THIS MIGHT BE OPTIMISTIC AT LEAST FOR TONIGHT. BAY AND ATLANTIC 
WATERS WILL HAVE AN EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINE FOR TODAY. 

THE BEST BET FOR LOWER AND NICER WIND SPEEDS IS STILL MONDAY...
AS THE HIGH DEFLATES AND SHIFTS SOUTH...TURNING KEYS WINDS TO SE 
10-15 KT. TUE MAY SEE LIGHTER WINDS AS WELL...BUT SOME RETURN OF 
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE ATLANTIC MAY START TO BOOST WINDS SLIGHTLY 
WED. IT OUGHT TO STAY WARM WITH JUST ISOLATED SHOWERS FOR THE NEXT 5 
DAYS.

.DISCUSSION...
OBSERVATIONS/ANALYSIS...
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES COVER THE KEYS WITH ISOLATED LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS 
MOVING QUICKLY WESTWARD ACROSS THE STRAITS. SEVERAL OF THESE HAVE 
CROSSED THROUGH THE LOWER KEYS WITH TRACE TO ONE HUNDREDTH OF AN 
INCH AMOUNTS. RECENT GULF STREAM ANALYSIS PLACED THE NORTH EDGE VERY 
CLOSE THE REEF WITH THESE SHOWERS APPARENTLY DEVELOPING OVER THE 
WARMER WATERS. MSAS CONFIRMS HIGHER STABILITY OVER THE MAINLAND AND 
COLDER GULF WATERS PER ITS SURFACE LI/THETA-E FIELDS. THERE HAS BEEN 
A NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN COVERAGE. TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING NEAR 
74-75 DEGREES. EAST WINDS HAVE BEEN NEAR 15 MPH OVER THE ISLANDS 
WITH HIGHER GUSTS...AND RANGING FROM NEAR 15 KNOTS IN FLORIDA BAY TO 
OVER 20 KNOTS IN THE STRAITS. THE EVENING SOUNDING INDICATES THAT 
THE RECENT WARM AIR ADVECTION HAS MIGRATED TO HIGHER 
ALTITUDES...CHANGING THE INVERSION INTO MORE OF A WARM...MOIST 
ADIABATIC SOUNDING. THE CELLS NOTICED IN THE STRAITS SEEM TO HAVE 
TROUBLE BUBBLING THROUGH A STABLE LAYER AROUND 7000-8000 FT. GEIGER 
KEY PRECIPITABLE WATER HAD PEAKED NEAR 1.4 INCHES AS DID THE EVENING 
SOUNDING AT KEY WEST...BUT SINCE RETREATED A BIT. THIS AGREES WELL 
WITH GFS PRECIPITABLE WATER GUIDANCE FOR 00Z.

FORECASTS...
FAST-MOVING ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO PASS OVER THE KEYS 
OVERNIGHT. THE MAJORITY OF THESE WILL NOT LAST LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE A 
HUNDREDTH. EAST WINDS WILL CONTINUE WITH TEMPERATURES LIKELY TO ONLY 
FALL ONE OR TWO DEGREES AT MOST. NO REASON TO CHANGE PUBLIC ZONE 
FORECASTS AT THIS TIME.

&&

.MARINE...
18Z GFS STILL HAS NOT CAUGHT UP WITH THE 12Z NAM FOR MARINE WINDS 
OVERNIGHT...AND WILL CONTINUE TO FAVOR THE STRONGER NAM. THUS SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORIES WILL CONTINUE FOR THE ATLANTIC WATERS. SMALL CRAFT 
CAUTION HEADLINES WILL CONTINUE FOR THE FLORIDA BAY AND GULFSIDE 
WATERS. WITH THE GULF STREAM CLOSE TO THE REEF...MOST OF THE 
ATLANTIC FORECAST WATERS ARE LIKELY NEAR 80F OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE.  
SHIPS NEAR THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA AND ONE EAST OF MIAMI REPORTED 
BRIDGE LEVEL WINDS 25 TO 30 KNOTS...LIKELY A LITTLE LESS CLOSER TO 
10-METERS.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
TEMPERATURES CLIMBED TO AROUND 80 TODAY WITH PARTIAL SUNSHINE. WINDS 
WERE FROM THE EAST AROUND 15 MPH ON LAND...SUSTAINED AROUND 20 KNOTS 
AT THE CMAN STATIONS WITH GUSTS TO 25. NO RECENT SHIP REPORTS WERE 
AVAILABLE UNFORTUNATELY. RADAR SHOWED A FEW SPRINKLES ON THE 
ATLANTIC SIDE.
&&
 
.ANALYSIS...
HIGH PRESSURE IS IN CONTROL OF OUR WEATHER. THE SURFACE ANTICYCLONE 
SPRAWLS ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN U.S. AND IS DELIVERING THE FRESH 
EAST WINDS. LOWER PRESSURE IN THE GULF OF CAMPECHE...UNDERNEATH THE 
SUBTROPICAL JET...IS ENHANCING THE GRADIENT IN THE WESTERN STRAITS 
RESULTING IN SLIGHTLY HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS.
&&

.FORECASTS...
THERE WILL BE LITTLE CHANGE IN OUR SENSIBLE WEATHER FOR THE NEXT 48 
HOURS. BY SUNDAY THE BIG BLUE H WILL BE CENTERED FAR ENOUGH OUT 
INTO THE ATLANTIC THAT OUR WINDS SHOULD TURN MORE INTO THE 
SOUTHEAST. THE RESULT SHOULD BE INCREASED MOISTURE AND QUITE MILD 
TEMPERATURES. IN FACT WE ARE SET TO EQUAL OR EXCEED OUR RECORD HIGH 
MINIMUMS FOR THE NEXT FEW NIGHTS (75). RAIN CHANCES WILL BE MINIMAL.

SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WHAT LOOKS LIKE A STRONG LEE-SIDE TROF WILL HEAD 
TOWARD THE UPPER GREAT LAKES AND THE CANADIAN MARITIMES...DISPLACING 
THE HIGH AND DRIVING A COOL FRONT INTO FLORIDA IN ITS WAKE. GUIDANCE 
STALLS THIS FEATURE TO OUR NORTH. FOR NOW WE HAVE DECREASED OUR WIND 
SPEEDS AND INCREASED OUR RAIN CHANCES TO 20 PERCENT STARTING ON 
MONDAY. IT DOES LOOK LIKE NEXT WEEK MIGHT BE UNSETTLED ALTHOUGH THE 
DETAILS ARE SKETCHY AT PRESENT. 
&&

.MARINE...
WE HAVE RETAINED A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE TONIGHT 
INTO SATURDAY. WE EXPECT WIND SPEEDS TO DECREASE SLIGHTLY SATURDAY 
NIGHT BUT WE MAY HAVE RESIDUAL SEAS AT THAT TIME. FOR TONIGHT 
FLORIDA BAY AND THE GULF-SIDE ZONES WILL BE SHELTERED PARTLY BY THE 
INTERVENING ISLANDS AND PARTLY BY THE CALMING EFFECT OF COOLER WATER 
TEMPERATURES ON THE WINDS. WITH NEITHER OF THESE FACTORS AT 
WORK...THE WESTERN STRAITS FROM KEY WEST TO DRY TORTUGAS WILL BE 
ROUGH.
&&

.AVIATION...
SMALL...LOW TOPPED SHOWERS WILL MOVE QUICKLY WESTWARD ACROSS THE 
TERMINALS AND KMIA-KEYW ROUTE TONIGHT.  THESE WILL CREATE VERY BRIEF 
AND INFREQUENT MVFR CONDITIONS. TOPS WILL BE BELOW 10KFT.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE MIDDLE 70S THIS MORNING WITH PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES. RADAR SHOWED A FEW SPRINKLES OUT OVER THE GULF STREAM. WINDS 
IN THE STRAITS WERE FROM THE EAST AROUND 20 KNOTS OFF KEY 
LARGO...NORTHEAST 20 TO 25 IN THE WESTERN STRAITS BASED ON A RECENT 
OBSERVATION FROM PULASKI SHOAL. SPEEDS ON LAND...AND IN FLORIDA 
BAY...WERE 10 TO 15 KNOTS. 

OUR MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED A DEEPENING EASTERLY FLOW BENEATH AN 
INVERSION LOCATED AT 750MB. AS A RESULT MOISTURE HAD UNDERGONE A 
BIG INCREASE IN THE LAST 24 HOURS. LIGHT SOUTHERLIES JUST ABOVE THE 
INVERSION HAD GENERATED A FIELD OF ALTOCUMULUS. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
OUR MORNING MESO-PLOT SHOWS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
CAROLINAS AND EXTENDING OVER FLORIDA AND THE NORTHERN CARIBBEAN. THE 
SUBTROPICAL JET CURVES CYCLONICALLY OVER THE YUCATAN AND CUBA TOWARD 
THE BAHAMAS...AND IS MAINTAINING LOWER PRESSURES IN THE BAY OF 
CAMPECHE. THIS IS ENHANCING THE GRADIENT AND APPEARS TO BE 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE HIGHER WIND SPEEDS IN THE WESTERN STRAITS.
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE DECREASING STRENGTH OF THE SUBSIDENCE INVERSION SHOULD ALLOW 
GREATER MIXING AND MOMENTUM TRANSFER TODAY -- WINDS AT 1&2 THOUSAND 
FEET WERE 20-25KTS. THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO BREAK UP THE MID-CLOUDS 
OVERHEAD BY AFTERNOON AND TO ENABLE US TO MAINTAIN THE SCA IN THE 
STRAITS. WITH THE SUNSHINE WE SHOULD HAVE NO TROUBLE REACHING OUR 
FORECAST MAXIMUMS. THUS WE PLAN NO CHANGES TO OUR GOING FORECASTS.
&&

.MARINE...
FLORIDA BAY...THE BACK COUNTRY...AND OUR GULF-SIDE ZONES SHOULD BE 
RELATIVELY PROTECTED TODAY. IT WILL BE ROUGH IN THE STRAITS BEYOND 
THE REEF. A SHIP REPORTED COMBINED SEAS TO 3M (7-9FT) IN THE GULF 
STREAM SOUTH OF LOOE KEY OVERNIGHT. WITH THE EASTERLIES GOING 
AGAINST THE CURRENT AND INCREASING IN SPEED...SEAS WILL BE STEEP AND 
PROBABLY BREAKING ESPECIALLY IN THE WESTERN STRAITS. 
&&

.AVIATION...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
LARGE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE (1032 MB) IS CENTERED OVER THE ATLANTIC 
EAST OF CAPE HATTERAS WITH A RIDGE EXTENDING WEST TO NORTH CAROLINA 
WHERE INLAND OVER THAT STATE A SMALLER (1032 MB) HIGH CENTER IS 
EMBEDDED WITHIN THE RIDGE AXIS. ANTICYCLONIC FLOW AROUND THE HIGH 
AND RIDGE CONTINUE TO DRIVE KEYS AREA WINDS MAINLY FROM THE EAST 
OVER REEF AND ATLANTIC WATERS. HOWEVER...A SLIGHT NOCTURNAL RIDGING 
SOUTH DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA IS GIVING A MORE NE WIND FLOW TO 
FLORIDA BAY, GULF WATERS, AND THE MID AND LOWER KEYS. THIS NE FLOW 
IS SHALLOW AND RELEGATED TO LEVELS BELOW 1 THSD FT AGL. WIND SPEEDS 
KEEPING VARYING UPWARDS TO NEAR 20 KT AT REEF SITES EXCEPT ALONG THE 
UPPER KEYS WHERE WINDS IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE ARE REPORTED AT 
MOLASSES REEF. WE DONT YET HAVE AN EARLY MORNING QUIKSCAT SATELLITE 
PASS TO ASSESS WINDS OUT IN THE STRAITS. THE LONG KEY C-MAN HAS BEEN 
REPORTING LIGHTER WINDS IN THE 10-15 KT RANGE...AND THIS MAY BE DUE 
TO STABILITY EFFECTS AS 72 DEGREE AIR MOVES OVER 71 OR COOLER 
WATERS. PATCHES OF CLOUD BASED NEAR 8 THSD FT HAVE THINNED OUT OVER 
THE KEYS THE PAST FEW HOURS. A FEW SPRINKLE-LIKE SHOWERS ARE SEEN 
ON RADAR OUT IN THE STRAITS SOUTH OF THE LOWER AND MID KEYS. 

.FORECAST...
NO CHANGES ARE BEING MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS. LATEST MODELS AGREE 
ON A CONTINUED WARMING SURFACE FLOW OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH JUST
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FROM LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND NOT FROM ANY 
LARGE SCALE SURFACE OR UPPER LEVELS SYSTEMS. IN THE EXTENDED PERIODS
...LATEST EUROPEAN AND GFS EXTENDED PROGS HAVE FRONTAL SYSTEMS 
STALLING NORTH OF THE KEYS.

TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT IN THE 5-8 THSD FT 
AGL LEVEL (APPROX 300K LEVEL) WHERE CLOUDS HAVE BEEN FORMING 
LATELY...IS STILL SHOWN TO DISAPPEAR TODAY WITH DRYING AIR MIXING 
FROM ABOVE DOWN INTO LOWER LEVELS. LOW POPS OF 10 PCT ARE MAINTAINED 
THROUGH SAT...AND MAYBE CURRENT 20 PERCENTERS FOR SAT NIGHT AND SUN 
CAN BE LOWERED...BUT I WILL LEAVE THESE AS IS SINCE HIGHER SURFACE 
DEWPOINTS AND A MODERATE TO FRESH SE WIND FLOW IS STILL INDICATED TO 
SET IN FOR THAT TIME FRAME. THE LARGE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE AREA IS 
FORECAST BY MOST MODELS TO EXPAND AND TIGHTEN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT 
OVER THE KEYS SLIGHTLY TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...THEN ONLY SHOW A SLIGHT
DECLINE SUN AND SUN NIGHT. WITH WIND DIRECTION GOING QUICKLY TO NEAR 
EAST TODAY...TURNING TO SE BY SUNDAY...TEMPERATURES SHOULD STAY A 
LITTLE OVER NORMAL...LOWER 70S TO NEAR 80. MIN TEMPS MAY STAY UP 
INTO THE MID 70S AT SOME SITES. 

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...AS STATED ABOVE...LATEST EXTENDED GUIDANCE 
MODELS KEEP FRONTAL SYSTEMS TO OUR NORTH WITH ONE WEAK COLD FRONT 
STALLING OUT SOMEWHERE OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE PENINSULA 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. ON THE WHOLE...MODELS SHOW A PERSISTENT 500 
MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTER OR RIDGE STAYING NEAR ENOUGH TO THE KEYS FOR 
SYSTEMS IN THE WESTERLIES TO PASS WELL TO OUR NORTH...ALTHOUGH THE 
500 MB HIGH AND RIDGE DO GET PRESSED A BIT FARTHER SE TUE AND WED AS 
A FRONT STALLS SOMEWHERE OVER FLORIDA. CONFIDENCE IN EXTENDED 
PERIODS ALWAYS RUNS LOW.

WILL REMAIN UP TODAY AND PROBABLY ON AT LEAST THROUGH SATURDAY. 
MODELS SHOW SOME VARYING WIND SPEEDS TODAY...NEAR 20 KT AT TIMES AND 
IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE AT OTHERS OVER ATLANTIC WATERS...BUT GOING A 
BIT STRONGER BY A FEW KNOTS TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...AS LARGE HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE ATLANTIC STRENGTHENS SLIGHTLY. TIMING OF A DOWN 
TREND IN WIND SPEEDS IS DIFFICULT BECAUSE IT LOOKS LIKE IMPROVEMENT 
WILL BE GRADUAL PERHAPS SUNDAY...BUT MORE RELIABLY NEXT MON AND TUE 
WHEN ATLANTIC-SIDE WINDS BECOMING E TO SE AND DROP INTO THE 10-15 KT

1000 PM EST THU DEC 28 2006

.DISCUSSION...
IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(700-200 MB)...AS OF 900 
PM...STREAMLINE ANALYSIS OVERLAID ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY DEPICTS A 
WELL STACKED MID AND UPPER CYCLONE NOW SITUATED OVER THE CENTRAL 
ARIZONA/NEW MEXICO BORDER. A DECENT 75 TO 100 KNOT JET ROUNDS THE 
BASE OF THE UPPER LOW OVER CENTRAL MEXICO...AS IT TRANSPORTS/ADVECTS 
VERY DRY AIR ON ITS PATH ACROSS THE GULF AND THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

IN THE LOW LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 900 PM...A 1030-1032 
MB RIDGE IS LOCKED IN PLACE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...EXTENDING 
WESTWARD INTO THE CAROLINA PIEDMONT. IT IS PINCHING A NICE GRADIENT 
ACROSS THE STATE OF FLORIDA...WITH THE 900 PM PRESSURE DIFFERENCE 
MAINTAINING APPROX 5 MB FROM JAX TO EYW. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE 
BENEATH THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE LARGE ANTICYCLONE AND 
UNDERNEATH A VERY SLOWLY MOISTENING BOUNDARY LAYER.

CURRENTLY...AS OF 900 PM...STRATOCUMULUS CEILINGS REMAIN 
CONCENTRATED THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS. 
TEMPERATURES OVER THE ISLANDS ARE IN THE LOWER 70S WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
THE LOWER 60S. NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OVER THE ISLANDS HAVE RANGED 
BETWEEN 13 AND 15 MPH...WITH ISOLATED HIGHER GUSTS...WHILST 10 METER 
WINDS ALONG THE REEF AND FLORIDA BAY ARE AVERAGING BETWEEN 18 TO AS 
HIGH AS 22 KNOTS WITH GUSTS NEAR 25 KNOTS. THE EVENING SOUNDING IS 
QUITE STABLE AND VERY DRY...WITH PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER) NOW AT .88 
INCHES...OR DOWN 7 HUNDREDTHS FROM THIS TIME YESTERDAY. A WEAKER 3 
DEGREE C INVERSION REMAINS BETWEEN 800 AND 758 MB. THIS HAS ALLOWED 
FOR A CONTINUATION OF WIDESPREAD STRATOCUMULUS CEILINGS TRAPPED 
BETWEEN 5000 AND 6500 FEET.

.FORECAST...TONIGHT...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(700 MB ON UP) 
THE NEARLY STACKED CLOSED LOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN CONUS WILL JUST 
AMBLE ALONG TO THE EAST...MAYBE REACHING THE TEXAS PANHANDLE BY 
TOMORROW EVENING. CONSEQUENTLY...CORRESPONDING HEIGHT RISES WILL 
OCCUR IN ADVANCE OF THIS FEATURE...I.E...ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO 
AND THE FLORIDA KEYS. AS A RESULT...VERY WARM AND DRY AIR WILL 
CONTINUE ALOFT OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

IN THE LOWER LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...THE 18Z (INTERMEDIATE) 
MODEL RUN OF THE GFS INITIALIZES THE CURRENT POSITION AND STRENGTH 
OF THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE NOW IN PLACE. MODELS MAINTAIN A NEAR 5 
MB GRADIENT ACROSS THE STATE FROM JACKSONVILLE TO KEY WEST. AS A 
RESULT...A CONTINUED SLIGHT MOISTENING AND DEEPENING OF EASTERLY 
FLOW IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT AND TOMORROW. AS FAR AS CLOUD COVER IS 
CONCERNED...LATEST INTERMEDIATE RUN FOR ALONG THE 300K AND 305K 
SURFACES WOULD INDICATES THAT STRATOCU/ALTOCU WOULD PROBABLY SCOUR 
OUT AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH WIDESPREAD STRATO-CU CURRENTLY 
ABOUND...WILL INTRODUCE TRANSITIONAL WORDING TO GRADUALLY DIMINISH 
CLOUD OVER LATER ON. WE ARE CARRYING SLIGHT CHANCE POPS...20%...BUT 
GIVEN LATEST NUMERICAL GUIDANCE AND THE SOUNDING...AND DO NOT SEE 
ANY OTHER REASON TO GO ABOVE CLIMO ATTM. THE 18Z 12 HR GFS POP #S 
ARE NEAR 10 PERCENT...WITH THE 18Z RUN OF THE MESOSCALE WRF KEEPING 
THE KEYS ESSENTIALLY DRY...AND SHOWING JUST A FEW SPRINKLES OVER THE 
UPPER KEYS TOWARDS MORNING...SO WILL TAKE POPS OUT FOR THE 
ISLANDS...FLORIDA BAY...AND THE GULF WATERS.

&& 

.MARINE...THE LATEST HOURLY SUSTAINED 10 METER WINDS AT 0200Z ARE 
NEAR 14 KNOTS AT SAND KEY...WHICH SEEMS TOO LOW...GIVEN THAT THE 
LAST 6 LAST HOURLY READINGS HAVE BEEN HOLDING NEAR 20 KNOTS. PULASKI 
SHOAL HAS ALSO BEEN BLOWING NEAR 20 KNOTS FOR THE PAST 6 
HOURS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 25 KNOTS. A 2250Z QUICKSCAT PASS DEPICTED 
SUSTAINED WINDS NEAR 20 KNOTS ACROSS THE ENTIRE MARINE DISTRICT. THE 
00Z RUN OF THE NAM20 IS HOLDING 20 KNOT WINDS RIGHT NEAR THE 
REEF...AND THE 18Z GFS MOS #S FOR SOMBRERO REEF...SAND KEY...AND 
MOLASSES REEF ARE ALL RIGHT NEAR 20 KNOTS. HAVE ELECTED TO ERR ON 
THE SIDE OF CAUTION AND GO WITH A SCA FOR THE ATLANTIC WATERS.

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH...AS WELL 
AS ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 24 
HOURS. STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS BASED AT AROUND FL070-080 WILL BE 
ABUNDANT ALONG MUCH OF THE KEYW-KMIA FLIGHT ROUTE...INCLUDING KEYW 
AND KMTH TONIGHT. THESE STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS WILL BE VERY THIN AS 
PILOTS SHOULD FIND CLEAR AIR ABOVE FL090. THE STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS 
SHOULD BEGIN TO DISSIPATE LATE TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING.

315 PM EST THU DEC 28 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
HIGH PRESSURE CURRENTLY OVER THE CAROLINA COAST CONTINUES TO PROVIDE 
A MODERATE EAST FLOW ACROSS THE KEYS AND COASTAL WATERS. THE WEAK 
SURFACE TROUGH ANALYZED OVER THE SOUTHEAST GULF EARLIER HAS WEAKENED 
AND IS HARD TO DETECT. IN SPITE OF THIS...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT 
REMAINS TIGHT ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF WITH EAST WINDS GUSTING TO 25 
KNOTS AT TIMES AT PULASKI SHOAL AND SAND KEY. EAST WINDS ARE CLOSER 
TO 15 KNOTS FROM SOMBRERO KEY TO MOLASSES REEF...WITH WINDS OVER THE 
ISLANDS GENERALLY 12 TO 15 MPH. STRATOCUMULUS REMAINED LARGELY 
INTACT OVER THE STRAITS TODAY...BUT HAS HAD A DIFFICULT TIME 
INTRUDING INTO THE DRIER AIRMASS OVER THE KEYS AND BAY/GULFSIDE 
WATERS. KBYX RADAR CONTINUED TO INDICATE THICKER CLOUDINESS AND SOME 
SPRINKLES SOUTHWEST OF KEY WEST THROUGHOUT THE DAY. PRECIPITABLE 
WATER HAS BEEN CREEPING UPWARD TO NEAR 0.9 INCHES AT THE GEIGER KEY 
IPW SITE...WITH THE CUDJOE KEY PROFILER SHOWING STEADY EAST WINDS 
THROUGH 3000 FEET WITH VEERING ABOVE. NO DOUBT THE WARM ADVECTION 
PATTERN IS BEGINNING.

.FORECAST...
EVOLUTION OF THE SLOW...CLOSED LOW ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL 
PLAINS THROUGH THIS WEEKEND LEADS TO HIGH CONFIDENCE IN THE BUILDING 
OF A BROAD UPPER RIDGE ACROSS THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN AND SOUTHEAST 
U.S. HIGHER HEIGHTS AND WARM ADVECTION THROUGH THE MID LEVELS IS 
LIKELY TO KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE FROM BEGINNING TOO SATURATED BELOW THE 
TEMPERATURE INVERSION AT 7000 FT. THIS MID/UPPER RIDGE IN 
COMBINATION OF THE OCCLUDED...STACKED NATURE OF THE MID-COUNTRY LOW 
PRESSURE TO PREVENT THE SLOW-MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY FROM REACHING 
THE KEYS AT ALL NEXT WEEK...WITH THE SENSIBLE WEATHER LIKELY DRIVEN 
BY A LOW-LEVEL RIDGE AXIS THROUGH THE WEST ATLANTIC AND NORTHERN 
BAHAMAS.

TONIGHT...AS THE INVERSION WEAKENS...WHAT IS LIKELY TO BE A QUICK 
SHOT OF ISENTROPIC LIFT TONIGHT WILL DIMINISH AS THE EAST FLOW FLOW 
THICKENS AND SOUTHEASTERLIES SOAR HIGHER IN ALTITUDE. WILL KEEP A 20 
POP OVERNIGHT FOR THE ISOLATED SHOWERS THAT ARE SURE TO ROAM THE 
STRAITS...ALTHOUGH THEY WILL LIKELY NOT MAKE TOO MUCH PROGRESS 
BEYOND THE REEF. CURRENT RADAR FROM CAMAGUEY AND HOLGUIN SHOWS A FEW 
SHOWERS IN THE WATERS WEST OF THE BAHAMAS AND TRAVELING ALONG THE 
RIDGES OF CENTRAL CUBA. CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE OVERNIGHT. 

FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...MOS POPS REMAIN IN THE SINGLE DIGITS WITH 
WARMING TEMPERATURES THE MOST LIKELY EFFECT. THE EROSION OF THE 
INVERSION WILL ALLOW FOR A COUPLE LAYERS OF MORE SCATTERED CLOUDS 
RATHER THAN A SINGLE BROKEN-OVERCAST DECK AFTER THE MORNING HOURS 
FRIDAY.

NEW YEARS DAY AND BEYOND...MEX POPS HAVE CLOSED IN ON 20 PERCENT FOR 
ALL 12-HOUR PERIODS EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAKES ITS 
MOST SOUTHERLY ADVANCE THROUGH THE CENTRAL FLORIDA PENINSULA BY 
TUESDAY...WHILE AN 850 MB RIDGE AXIS REMAINS ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA. 
THE APPROACH OF THE TROUGH AND THE STEADFAST RIDGE WILL ALLOW WINDS 
TO TURN OUT OF THE SOUTHEAST BUT WEAKEN. MOISTURE BEGINS TO POOL IN 
THE CONVERGENCE FIELD NEAR THE APPROACHING TROUGH...BUT MOST OF THE 
SCATTERED SHOWERS ACCOMPANYING IT SHOULD REMAIN TO THE NORTH. 
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST CONTINUES THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS 20 POPS 
WITH EASTERLY FLOW RESUMING AT LIGHT TO MODERATE SPEEDS. 
TEMPERATURES WILL HOLD A GOOD 4 DEGREES ABOVE CLIMO AVERAGES FOR 
NEXT WEEK.

&&

.MARINE...
SMALL VESSEL OWNERS HOPING FOR A GOOD FISHING WEEKEND WILL HAVE TO 
CONTEND WITH FRESH EAST WINDS OVER THE STRAITS FRIDAY THROUGH 
SATURDAY. GFS AND THE MORE BULLISH NAM GUIDANCE HAD TRENDED UPWARD 
OVER THE PAST DAY WITH PEAK WIND SPEEDS EXPECTED TO BE NEAR SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY LEVELS OVER THE STRAITS FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. 
INDICATIONS THAT THIS IS LIKELY TO BE A LOW-END SCA EVENT WITH 
LARGEST SEAS OVER THE GULF STREAM. OVER THE FLORIDA BAY AND GULFSIDE 
WATERS...WILL HOLD WINDS IN THE SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION RANGE. 
AS TO BE EXPECTED WITH LONG-DURATION EAST WIND EVENTS...MARINERS 
HEADING TO AND FROM KEY WEST FROM GULF WATERS WILL DO BEST TO STAY 
CLOSER TO THE SHORES OF SOUTHWEST FLORIDA. MARINERS OVER THE STRAITS 
SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE STEEPENING SEAS OVER THE GULF STREAM. ONLY 
ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND INTO MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT ALONG THE FLIGHT ROUTE MIAMI TO 
KEY WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. LIGHT TURBULENCE AND PATCHY

WINDS ARE NORTHEAST 10 TO 15 MPH OVER THE ISLANDS...AND ARE RUNNING 
FROM NEAR 12 KNOTS ALONG THE UPPER KEYS REEF TO 17 KNOTS AT PULASKI 
SHOAL NEAR DRY TORTUGAS. 

.FORECAST...
FOR THIS AFTERNOON...THE MAIN ISSUE WILL BE CLOUD COVER. AT THIS 
TIME I AM CONFIDENT THE ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL SET UP OVER THE STRAITS 
THIS AFTERNOON KEEPING MOST OF THE CLOUDS SOUTHEAST OF THE ISLAND 
CHAIN. TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING IN LINE WITH MOS AND SHOULD REACH 
THE FORECASTED MID 70S. NO CHANGES TO THE PUBLIC ZONES ARE 
PLANNED...ALTHOUGH AM NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF SHOWERS TODAY.

&&

.MARINE...
NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS WILL CONTINUE AT A SOLID 15 KNOTS THROUGH 
EARLY AFTERNOON OVER THE STRAITS. ADVENTURESOME MARINERS HEADING 
WELL BEYOND THE REEF MAY ENCOUNTER SPRINKLES. LAST FEW COMPUTER 
MODEL RUNS OF THE GFS AND THE AGGRESSIVE NAM ARE INDICATING A 
TIGHTER PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC/SOUTHEAST 
SEABOARD HIGH PRESSURE AND DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE ACROSS NORTH 
TEXAS/OKLAHOMA BY SATURDAY. THIS MAY RESULT IN SLIGHTLY HIGHER WINDS 
THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE FLIGHT ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY 
WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. LIGHT TURBULENCE AND PATCHY CIGS 
FL060-070 WILL BE FOUND...ESPECIALLY ON THE SOUTHERN FLANK OF THE 
ROUTE CORRIDOR....WHERE A TEMPERATURE INVERSION EXISTS.

350 AM EST THU DEC 28 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
HIGH PRESSURE IN NOW CENTERED ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST EARLY THIS 
MORNING...EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD OVER NORTH AND CENTRAL FLORIDA. A 
SUBTLE SURFACE TROUGH IS DRIFTING NORTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE 
SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. KBYX RADAR SHOWS JUST A FEW SPECKS OF 
VERY SHALLOW RETURNS OUT IN THE STRAITS...SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. 
IR SATELLITE INDICATES CLEAR SKIES TO THE NORTH OF OUR IMMEDIATE 
AREA...AND THE NORTHWESTERN EDGE OF A STRATOCU DECK FLIRTING WITH 
THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MIDDLE 60S AT THIS 
HOUR...WITH A GENTLE TO MODERATE NORTHEAST BREEZE SET UP.

.FORECAST...
THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WILL FEATURE A SMALL 
BUILDING OF HEIGHTS OVER THE LOCAL AREA OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS. THE HIGH SURFACE PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST COAST BUILDS OVER 
THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC THROUGH FRIDAY...AND IS REINFORCED FROM 
THE NORTH THROUGH THE DAY ON SATURDAY. OVER THE IMMEDIATE AREA...THE 
FLOW THROUGH ROUGHLY 5 KFT TAKES ON A PRONOUNCED EASTERLY DIRECTION 
TOPPED BY A WEAK VEERED PROFILE THROUGH THE MIDDLE LEVELS AND TOPPED 
BY A DEEPER DRY AIRMASS. LITTLE DEPARTURE FROM PREVIOUS THINKING AS 
FAR AS THE FORECAST IS CONCERNED FOR THE NEXT 7 DAYS. BUT THERE ARE 
A COUPLE OF SHORT TERM CONCERNS. ONE IS THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER 
OVER THE ISLANDS TODAY. AS THE FLOW VEERS THROUGH THE DAY...IT WOULD 
SEEM THAT THE CLOUD COVER WOULD BE MORE PESSIMISTIC...BUT IR IMAGES 
SHOW A DEGREE OF EROSION OFF TO THE IMMEDIATE SOUTHWEST AND 
SOUTHEAST. DUE TO THAT...WILL GO PARTLY CLOUDY TODAY AND JUST KEEP A 
MINIMAL MENTION OF LIGHT SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST. THE SIGNIFICANT 
MOISTURE PROFILE DOES NOT CHANGE FROM FRIDAY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF 
NEXT WEEK. AT THAT POINT...A WEAKENING FRONT WILL BE LOSING ITS 
MOMENTUM ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTH FLORIDA. IF CLOUDS DO IN FACT 
THICKEN TODAY...WHICH I FEEL IS NOT LIKELY THANKS TO ITS RELATIVELY 
SHALLOW NATURE ON FORECAST LOCAL SOUNDINGS...TEMPERATURES WILL HAVE 
A SLIGHTLY HARDER TIME HITTING FORECAST TEMPS. BUT AS THE FLOW VEERS 
THAT CONCERN IS NOT GREAT EITHER. SO...EXPECT LITTLE CHANGE FOR ANY 
PERIOD OF THIS EARLY MORNING FORECAST. THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS MENTIONED FOR EACH PERIOD THROUGH NEXT WEDNESDAY...AND 
ONCE THE MORE DEFINITE EAST FLOW IS IN PLACE THE TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE A GOOD 5 DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGE.

&&

.MARINE...
THE LATEST NAM IS SHOWING MORE PERIODIC WIND SPEEDS OF 20 KNOTS OVER 
THE STRAITS TODAY...AND A MORE EXPANSIVE STRETCH OF 20+ KNOTS OVER 
THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWESTERN WATERS FROM FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON. THERE SHOULD BE A PEAK IN THE SURGE OF EAST WINDS ON 
SATURDAY...BUT PLAN TO STICK CLOSER TO THE MILDER GFS SURFACE FIELDS 
THROUGH THE NEXT 72 HOURS. THIS IS CLOSE...IF JUST A LITTLE 
ABOVE...WHAT WE ARE CURRENTLY ADVERTISING FOR ALL MARINE ZONES. THAT 
SAID...AN EXERCISE CAUTION FOR SMALL CRAFT WILL PROBABLY BE 
NECESSARY FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY OVER THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS. OTHERWISE...NO CAUTIONARY OR ADVISORY HEADLINES ARE EXPECTED.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AND AT KEYS TERMINALS THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 24 HOURS. 
STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS BASED AT AROUND 6KFT WILL BE ABUNDANT ALONG THE 
MARINE PORTION OF THE ROUTE...ESPECIALLY THIS MORNING. SOME OF THIS 
CLOUD COVER WILL OCCASIONALLY BLEED OVER INTO SOUTH FLORIDA. THESE 
STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS WILL BE THIN AS PILOTS SHOULD FIND CLEAR AIR 
ABOVE FL070. SURFACE WINDS ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN WILL BE NORTHEAST 
AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS.

.DISCUSSION...
IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(800-200 MB)...AS OF 900 PM...THE MAIN 
AXIS OF A DEEPENING...BUT NARROW AND SHARP UPPER TROUGH AXIS IS 
POSITIONED OVER SIERRAS IN THE WESTERN CONUS. AT 250 MB...LATEST 
AVAIL STREAMLINE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE UPPER FLOW FLATTENS OUT 
A BIT AS IT MOVES EASTWARD OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN CONUS...WITH 
STRONGER JET MAXIMA OVER THE NORTHERN CONUS. THE WEAKER SOUTHERN 
STREAM IS NOW MOVING ACROSS OLD MEXICO...THE GULF OF MEXICO...AND 
THE FLORIDA KEYS. LATEST EVENING 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING AND AVAILABLE 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES THAT VERY DRY AND STABLE AIR IS 
EVIDENT FROM NEAR 800 MB AND ON UP OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS.

IN THE LOW LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 800 MB)...AS OF 900 PM...THE CENTER 
OF A LARGE 1025 MB ANTICYCLONE IS POSITIONED OVER THE CAROLINAS. ON 
THE REGIONAL SCALE...MSAS ANALYSIS INDICATES EVIDENCE OF A WEAK 
TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEX...WELL WEST OF THE KEYS. THE 
FLORIDA KEYS LIE BENEATH THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE LARGE 
ANTICYCLONE...UNDERNEATH A MUCH DRIER LOWER ATMOSPHERE THAN 24 HOURS 
AGO...WITH PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER) DOWN ABOUT A THIRD OF AN INCH TO 
.90 INCHES. A NICE 5 DEGREE C INVERSION REMAINS IN PLACE BETWEEN 806 
AND 759 MILLIBARS...RESULTING IN WIDESPREAD STRATOCUMULUS CEILINGS 
BETWEEN 5000 AND 6000 FEET.

.CURRENTLY...IR SATELLITE IMAGERY DEPICTS MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVER 
THE ISLANDS AND ALL ADJOINING WATERS EXCEPT THE OFFSHORE GULF 
WATERS 20 TO 60 NM WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY. KEY WEST RADAR IS 
DEVOID OF ANY ECHOES. TEMPERATURES REMAIN IN THE MIDDLE 60S...WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 50S. WINDS OVER THE ISLANDS ARE NOW NORTHEAST 
NEAR 10 MPH....WITH C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF 
REGISTERING SUSTAINED 10 METER WINDS BETWEEN 12 AND 14 KNOTS WITH 
GUSTS TO NEAR 20 KNOTS.

.FORECAST...TONIGHT...IN THE UPPER LEVELS...THE TROUGH OVER THE 
SIERRAS WILL FURTHER DEVELOP INTO A CLOSED LOW OVER NEW MEXICO BY 
MORNING. DRY AIR OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL REMAIN IN PLACE 
OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS.

AT THE SURFACE...THE LATEST INTERMEDIATE RUNS OF THE GFS AND NAM ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH THE 1025 MB ANTICYCLONE MOVING INTO THE ATLANTIC AND 
MOVING OFFSHORE LATE TONIGHT...BUT NOT STRENGTHENING TO A 1028-1030 
MB RIDGE OVER THE CAROLINAS AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC UNTIL TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON. 

ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...ALREADY...VWP AND THE EVENING SOUNDING 
ILLUSTRATE THAT THE WINDS IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER ARE MAINLY 
NORTHEAST...BUT DEWPOINTS ARE STILL ONLY IN THE 50S. THE 
(18Z)INTERMEDIATE RUNS FOR ALONG THE 300K SURFACE...SEEM TO 
INITIALIZE WELL WITH THE STRONG INVERSION...AND DO NOT GIVE MUCH 
HOPE FOR THE THIN CLOUDINESS TO BREAK TONIGHT...EXCEPT MAYBE OVER 
THE UPPER KEYS. AS A RESULT...WOULD THINK THAT THE BEST PLACE FOR 
TEMPERATURES TO FALL TO NEAR 60 WOULD BE IN THE UPPER KEYS...WITH 
THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS POSSIBLY NOT FALLING BELOW 64 DEGREES. 
ONLY MINOR TWEAKS TO THE PUBLIC WILL BE TO JUST INSERT MOSTLY CLOUDY 
WORDING AND OPEN UP A TEMPERATURE RANGE FOR 60 TO 65 DEGREES.

&&

.MARINE...WITH THE ABSENCE OF IDENTIFIABLE NORTHWEST SWELL...CAN 
RECOMBINE ALL ATLANTIC WATERS IN THE GRIDS. WE HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY 
SHIP REPORTS THIS EVENING...BUT WE RECEIVED A QUICKSCAT PASS AT 
23Z...WITH WINDS BETWEEN 15 AND 20 KNOTS INDICATED IN THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS...AND 20 PLUS IN THE OUTER FLORIDA STRAITS. THOUGH 
ATTM...WINDS ALONG THE REEF ARE NEAR 15 KNOTS...COULD SEE A BIT OF 
SURGING OVERNIGHT. DO NOT SEE SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION 
CONDITIONS ALONG THE REEF...WILL INDICATE 15 KNOTS AND GUSTY ACROSS 
THE ATLANTIC WATERS. NO OTHER CHANGES 


&&

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH...AS WELL 
AS ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 24 
HOURS. STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS BASED AT AROUND FL060 WILL BE ABUNDANT 
ALONG THE WATER PORTION (60SW KMIA-KEYW) OF THE KEYW-KMIA FLIGHT

THE KEYS AND POINTS NORTH EXPERIENCED RAPID CLEARING AS DRY AIR 
DROPPED OVER THE ISLANDS DRYING TENACIOUS MOISTURE UNDER A STRONG 
TEMPERATURE INVERSION AT 7000 FT. CUDJOE KEY PROFILER SHOWS NORTH TO 
NORTHEAST WINDS BELOW 4000 FT WITH GEIGER KEY INTEGRATED 
PRECIPITABLE WATER DOWN TO NEAR 0.70 INCHES. NORTHEAST WINDS 
CONTINUE AT 10 TO 15 MPH WITH A FEW PEAK GUSTS TO 20 MPH ALONG THE 
REEF...TRENDING DOWNWARD THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. 

.FORECAST...
GRADUAL CHANGES IN STORE OVER THE NEXT WEEK. IN THE MID/UPPER 
LEVELS...THE UPPER PATTERN FEATURES A GRADUALLY EXPANDING FLAT UPPER 
RIDGE WHICH SHIFTS EASTWARD INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC THIS WEEKEND 
AS AN UPPER LOW FORMS NEAR THE FOUR CORNERS REGION AND HEADS 
NORTHEAST THROUGH THE PLAINS. GUIDANCE HAS REACHED A STRONG 
CONSENSUS WITH THE UPPER FEATURES...THUS THE PROGNOSIS FOR BUILDING 
HEIGHTS LOOKS GOOD IF NOT ALL THAT SEASONABLE. AT THE SURFACE...THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS WILL FEATURE A STRENGTHENING HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST COAST AND WESTERN ATLANTIC. FOR TONIGHT...THIS 
WILL SERVE FIRST TO CUT OFF THE COLD ADVECTION THAT MANAGED TO KEEP 
MAX TEMPERATURES IN THE KEYS A FEW DEGREES BELOW SURROUNDING WATER 
TEMPERATURES IN SPITE OF DECENT SUNSHINE. BY THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
FRIDAY...THE RIDGE WILL TIGHTEN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT AND CREATE 
MODERATE TO POSSIBLY BREEZY EASTERLY FLOW BY FRIDAY AND TURNING MORE 
SOUTHEAST SATURDAY/SUNDAY. GUIDANCE ALSO AGREES (GFS/EUROPEAN) ON A 
WEAKENING SURFACE TROUGH APPROACHING BY TUESDAY. PERHAPS THE MOST 
INTERESTING FEATURE WILL BE THE RAPID RETURN OF ISENTROPIC LIFT BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT. EXPECT A RAPID RETURN OF STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS ACROSS 
THE STRAITS WITH GRADUAL INCREASE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. FRIDAY MAY 
BE DOWNRIGHT CLOUDY. WITH THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE HOLDING ON AND 
A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE FOLLOWING THE TROUGH...A COL REGION IS DEPICTED 
ACROSS CENTRAL/SOUTH FLORIDA. MOISTURE WILL BE PLENTIFUL BUT NOT 
SURE HOW MUCH SURFACE CONVERGENCE WILL BE PRESENT. UPPER JET IS 
EXPECTED TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS MEX POPS HAVE 
SHIFTED TOWARDS TUESDAY BUT STILL DECREASING FROM PREVIOUS 
RUNS...LEFT A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE EXTENDED.

LET THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES FOR SEAS EXPIRE. A WEAK LOW PRESSURE 
TROUGH OVER THE YUCATAN CHANNEL WILL DISSIPATE TONIGHT...WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING STRONGLY ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST U.S. INTO THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC. THE TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL ALLOW FOR 
MODERATE TO FRESH EAST WINDS BY FRIDAY...PEAKING FRIDAY NIGHT AND

KEYS.

.FORECAST...
THE MEAN AXIS OF THE MID TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVES EAST OF THE 
AREA TODAY. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE IN THE DEEP SOUTH WILL 
EXPAND ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES TODAY...AND THEN INTO THE WESTERN 
NORTH ATLANTIC TONIGHT. AS A RESULT...THE LOCAL FLOW WILL TURN FROM 
THE NORTH/NORTHEAST RATHER QUICKLY AROUND TO THE EAST THROUGH ABOUT 
4 KFT...AND INCREASE IN SPEED THROUGH THAT LAYER ON THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT. IN THE SHORT TERM...SENT THE ZONE PACKAGE OUT EARLY 
THIS MORNING TO COVER THE MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND INSERT A MENTION 
OF DRIZZLE. AS THE LOWER LEVELS VEER THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...WE 
SHOULD SEE SOME BREAKS FOR SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT IT WILL 
STILL BE ON THE COOL SIDE WITH TEMPERATURES ONLY TOPPING OUT AROUND

FRONT IS EXPECTED TO CROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO DURING THE UPCOMING 
NEW YEARS WEEKEND...BUT IT APPEARS IT WILL NOT HAVE QUITE ENOUGH

THE HIGH TO THE NORTH AND LOWER PRESSURES TO THE SOUTH IS NOW 
TIGHTER THAN PREVIOUS EXPECTED. ON THE OTHER HAND...THE LOW PRESSURE 
PULLING NORTHWESTWARD FROM THE YUCATAN CHANNEL AS DEPICTED BY THE 
NAM SEEMS EXCESSIVE TONIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. 
NONETHELESS...I PLAN TO ADD A FEW KNOTS THROUGH LATE THIS EVENING IN 
ALL MARINE ZONES ON THE UPCOMING FORECAST WHICH WILL KEEP THE 
ADVISORY AND CAUTIONARY HEADLINES IN PLACE AS THEY ARE. BOATERS 
SHOULD KEEP ABREAST OF THE LATEST MARINE FORECASTS...AS AN EXTENSION

PATCHES THAT WERE OVER THE KEYS THIS MORNING HAVE MOVED OUT OF THE

EAST OVER THE AREA ALONG A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE TROUGH. THAT TROUGH
AS OF 3 PM HAD MOVED INTO THE LOWER KEYS AND FLORIDA BAY...BRINGING

WELL...AS DRYING ALOFT SPREADS DOWN OFF THE MAINLAND. ZONES WILL 
INDICATE CLOUDS AND SLIGHT RISK OF SHOWERS THIS EVENING, HOWEVER, 
DUE TO THE SPOTTY SHOWERS NEAR THE PASSING TROUGH. I WONT STRAY 
FROM MOS GUIDANCE ON MIN TEMPS...WHICH SHOW A DROP IN TEMPS LATE 
TONIGHT WITH THAT TURN OF WINDS OFF THE MAINLAND. NEAR 60F FOR 
NOMINAL LOWS WILL BE SPECIFIED BY 58-62F FOR AN UP-AND-DOWN THE 
ISLANDS RANGE. 

WED AND WED NIGHT...DRY AIR IS INDICATED TO WORK OVER THE KEYS AT 
LEVELS ABOVE 7 THSD FT AGL...WHICH IS NOT QUITE AS LOW A LEVEL AS 
PREVIOUS EXPECTED. WHILE MIXING MAY THIN OUT CLOUDS DURING THE DAY 
WED...I AM NOT CONFIDENT OF GETTING RID OF ALL STRATOCU...AND OPTED
TO SAY PARTLY CLOUDY FOR SKY COVER. A TURN OF WINDS TO NE WILL
SLIGHTLY MODERATE TEMPS WED NIGHT. HOWEVER...WE MAY SEE LOWEST
OVERNIGHT READINGS DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT...THEN
WITH STABLE OR RISING TEMPS LATE. 

THU-SUN...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE ATLANTIC WILL TURN WINDS TO E THEN 
ESE...AND TEMPS WILL MODERATE THROUGH THE PERIOD. NO LARGE SCALE 
DISTURBANCES ARE SEEN NEAR THE KEYS...BUT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
IS IN ORDER DUE TO LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. I MAY GET BREEZE PART OF THIS 
TIME. 

SUNDAY NIGHT-NEW YEARS DAY...EXTENDED MODELS HAVE A WEAK FRONT
PASSING THE KEYS. IF THIS HAPPENS...A HIGHER CHANCE OF RAIN AND MORE 
CLOUD COVER MAY OCCUR. FOR NOW...TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AT THIS FAR 
OUT TIME FRAME PRECLUDES PESSIMISTIC VERBIAGE. 

MONDAY NIGHT-TUE...IF THAT FRONT MATERIALIZES...IT MAY GET JUST A 
LITTLE COOLER. 
&&

.MARINE...
A SHIFT OF WINDS TO NW...AND BOOST OF WIND SPEEDS INTO THE 15-20 KT 
RANGE FOR THE EVENING WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH A PASSING TROUGH. 
LOOK FOR WINDS TO GO N NEAR 15 KT LATE TONIGHT. LARGE SWELLS ARE 
BEING REPORTED BY THE EAST GULF MOORED BUOY AND BY SHIPS IN THE SE 
GULF AND EVEN IN THE SOUTHWEST FLORIDA STRAITS. SO...SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS WILL REMAIN UP AS PLANNED FOR GULF AND 
WESTERN STRAITS WATERS TONIGHT...CONTINUING INTO WEDNESDAY.

WINDS OUGHT TO GO NE WED 15 KT...E BY THU WITH SOME HIGHER WIND 
SPEEDS...MAYBE GUSTY AS HIGH PRESSURE EXPANDS OVER THE ATLANTIC. 
E TO SE WINDS SAT...TURNING S SUN IF ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHES. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
TONIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. PREVAILING 
CEILINGS WILL AFFECT THE MAJORITY OF THE ROUTE...MAINLY BASED 
ANYWHERE FROM FL080-150. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL ALSO AFFECT THE ROUTE 
THROUGH THIS EVENING...PRODUCING BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS. 
SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE MAINLY NORTHWEST AT AROUND 
12-16 KT WITH INTERMITTENT GUSTS JUST ABOVE 20 KT...RESULTING IN 
PERIODS OF 10 KT OR GREATER CROSSWINDS.

THERE IS AN AIRMET IN EFFECT UNTIL 03Z FOR MODERATE ICE BETWEEN

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1030 AM EST TUE DEC 26 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN CONTINUE TO STREAM NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE 
KEYS. CURRENT KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR WIND PROFILE SHOWS A SW TO WSW
WIND FLOW AT 1 THSD FT AND UPWARDS...WHICH VERIFIES THE SHALLOWNESS 
OF THE SURFACE AIRMASS AND LACK OF ANY DRYING JUST ABOVE THE 
SURFACE. AT THE SURFACE...THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT HAS MOVED INTO THE 
BAHAMAS. A SECONDARY SURFACE TROUGH IS ANALYZED SWINGING SE OVER 
FLORIDA AND THE GULF...AND ITS POSITION IS NOW IDENTIFIED BY A 
NARROW LINE OF SHOWERS FROM NEAR FT. MYERS EXTENDING SW AND JUST 
APPROACHING DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. WINDS ARE GOING SOMEWHAT 
ERRATIC OVER THE KEYS AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH...TURNING FROM NW TO SW 
WITH SPEEDS HAVING TEMPORARILY DROPPED TO 10 KT OR LESS. MEANWHILE...
WIND REPORTS FROM THE EAST GULF MOORED BUOY 42003, SHIP REPORTS, AND
A MORNING SATELLITE QUIKSCAT PASS SHOW WINDS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE 
SURFACE TROUGH ARE BLOWING FROM THE W TO NW IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE. 
LOTS OF CLOUDS COVER THE EAST GULF. 

.FORECAST...
PUBLIC ZONES WILL BE UPDATED FOR AFTERNOON TRANSITION OF SHOWER 
CHANCE AND WIND TRENDS. THAT SURFACE TROUGH SHOULD PASS SE OVER THE 
KEYS DURING THE AFTERNOON...TURNING AREA WINDS TO THE W AND NW...
WITH AN INCREASE IN SPEED AGAIN TO 15 MPH OR MAYBE GUSTY NEAR 20 
MPH. RAINY AREAS WILL GIVE WAY TO SOME SPOTTY SHOWERS WITH THE
TROUGH PASSAGE. TEMPERATURES MAY HOVER OR FLUCTUATE AROUND IN THE 
LOWER TO MID 70S RANGE. 
&&

.MARINE...
SOMEWHAT ERRATIC WINDS TURNING FROM NW TO SW 10 KT OR SO WILL 
TEMPORARILY AFFECT THE KEYS THROUGH LATE MORNING INTO EARLY 
AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THERE IS A SURFACE TROUGH JUST APPROACHING DRY 
TORTUGAS AT 10 AM THAT WILL PROBABLY MOVE SE OVER THE KEYS DURING 
THE AFTERNOON...AND WITH ITS PASSAGE WINDS OUGHT TO GO MORE W THEN 
NW WITH AN INCREASE IN SPEEDS TO 15 KT WITH SOME PULSES OR GUSTS 
UPWARDS TO 20 KT. 

STRONG WINDS OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHER GULF THE PAST FEW DAYS 
HAVE GENERATED LARGE SWELLS FROM THE NW AND W. THE EAST GULF BUOY 
210 MILES NW OF DRY TORTUGAS HAS BEEN REPORTING 11 FT SWELLS WITH AN 
11 SECOND PERIOD. THESE SWELLS HAVE PROPAGATED INTO THE SE GULF AND 
PROBABLY EVEN INTO THE FLORIDA STRAITS SOUTH OF DRY TORTUGAS TO 
SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. I DONT HAVE ANY CURRENT SHIP REPORTS IN 
THESE WATERS...BUT WAVE MODELS SUGGEST SWELLS MAY BE UP INTO THE 6-9 
FT RANGE IN OPEN DEEP WATERS AROUND DRY TORTUGAS. A SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR KEYS GULF OF 
MEXICO WATERS...AND WATERS KEY WEST TO BEYOND DRY TORTUGAS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. LAYERED CEILINGS WILL AFFECT THE 
MAJORITY OF THE ROUTE THROUGH THE DAY...MOSTLY BASED ANYWHERE FROM 
FL050-120. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL ALSO AFFECT THE ROUTE...PRODUCING 
BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE 
MAINLY SOUTHWEST AT LESS THAN 10 KT THIS MORNING...BECOMING 
NORTHWEST AND INCREASING TO AROUND 15 KT THIS AFTERNOON. THIS WILL 
PRODUCE INTERMITTENT CROSSWINDS OF 10 KT OR MORE THIS 
AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY AT KEYW.

THERE IS AN AIRMET IN EFFECT UNTIL 21Z FOR MODERATE ICE BETWEEN 
FRZLVL AND FL240...WITH FRZLVL 080-140. AT 12Z THE KEY WEST RAOB 
SHOWED A FRZLVL AROUND 130.

.CLIMATE...
KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT RECEIVED 1.32 INCHES OF RAIN 
YESTERDAY...BRINGING THE YEAR-TO-DATE RAINFALL TOTAL UP TO 1.08 
INCHES ABOVE NORMAL. THIS GUARANTEES THAT KEY WEST WILL FINISH THE 
YEAR AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL. WE ARE ABOUT 15 INCHES BELOW LAST 
YEARS FAR ABOVE-NORMAL RAINFALL TOTAL.

====================================================================
.EARLIER DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX RADAR IS INDICATING STRIPS OF N/S ORIENTED LIGHT SHOWERS 
CONTINUING TOWARDS THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS AT THIS HOUR. MORE 
ELEVATED ECHOES ARE PROMINENT IN THE WATERS WEST OF THE DRY TORTUGAS

CURRENTLY WORKING THROUGH THE ISLAND CHAIN...IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE 
THIN LINE OF SHOWERS. TEMPERATURES ARE STILL IN THE LOWER 70S AT ALL 
REPORTING SENSORS IN THE SERVICE AREA.

.FORECAST...
THE COLD FRONT ALONG THE ISLANDS EARLY THIS MORNING WILL CLEAR THE

STRETCHING BACK INTO THE GULF FROM NEAR CTY...PASSES THROUGH THE 
KEYS BY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. WE SHOULD SEE PERIODIC GUSTY WINDS 
JUST NORTH OF WEST PRIOR TO THE TROUGH...AND THEN A MORE DEFINITIVE 
NORTHWEST PUSH ON THE BACK SIDE. PRECIPITABLE WATERS WILL THEN DIVE 
TO WELL BELOW ONE INCH WITH LOWER LEVEL LINGERING CLOUDS EXPECTED TO 
GIVE WAY TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING. WILL KEEP A 30 POP IN FOR 
SHOWERS TODAY WITH THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF A MID LEVEL VORT LOBE 
SWINGING THROUGH THE GULF ASSISTING THE SURFACE TROUGH. CAN NOT 
ARGUE WITH THE MOS VALUES FOR POPS TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WHICH 
ARE ALL AT OR CLOSE TO SINGLE DIGITS. THE COOL PERIOD THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY SHOULD BE RATHER SHORT-LIVED AS BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS TURN 
QUICKLY TO THE NORTHEAST/EAST FOR THURSDAY. MOS VALUES CONTINUE TO 
CLUSTER AROUND THE 70 DEGREE MARK FOR WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES ARE 
EXPECTED BACK ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGE BY FRIDAY...AND LAST UNTIL 
SUNDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT PULLING THROUGH THE GULF OF 
MEXICO. WILL KEEP A SMALL POP MENTIONED...JUST A SLIGHT 
CHANCE...FROM THURSDAY THROUGH THE NEW YEARS WEEKEND...BUT DAYS 6

&&

.MARINE...
LONGER PERIOD NORTHWESTERLY SWELLS ARE CERTAINLY ON THEIR 
WAY...ESPECIALLY LOOKING UPSTREAM AT BUOY 42003...AND MORE RECENTLY 
AT THE PLSF1 WIND SPEEDS. THE SHORT RANGE GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT INDICATING THAT THE 15 TO 20 KNOTS WINDS SHOULD HAVE THEIR 
PEAK PERIOD THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH EARLY EVENING...ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
THE WESTERN HALF OF THE MARINE AREA. THE CURRENT MARINE FORECAST HAS 
A NICE HANDLE ON THE EXPECTED WIND AND SEA CONDITIONS. A SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS WILL REMAIN IN THE GULF WATERS ADJACENT 
AND OFFSHORE OF THE LOWER KEYS...AND IN THE WATERS EXTENDING 
WESTWARD TO BEYOND DRY TORTUGAS...AND LASTING THROUGH TONIGHT.

WINDS WILL TO TO THE NORTH AND THEN NORTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS ON

KBYX DETECTS NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND WIDELY SEPARATED THUNDERSTORMS 
OVER THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE AREA FROM OCEAN 
REEF TO KEY WEST. IN ADDITION...KBYX DETECTS WIDESPREAD SHOWERS OVER 
THE UPPER KEYS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS PATCHY LIGHT RAIN OVER THE 
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE 
CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE WEST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON 
AVERAGE...ARE WEST TO NORTHWEST NEAR 10 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 15 
KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 70S. ONLY ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES 
OF COOLING IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT DUE TO PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER. 

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
A COLD FRONT IS LOCATED BETWEEN THE MARQUESAS KEYS AND THE DRY 
TORTUGAS. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS TONIGHT. A SECONDARY 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS RAIN CONTAMINATED AND 
IS NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF CURRENT ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS. ONCE THE 
STEADIER...HEAVIER RAIN CLEARS THE UPPER KEYS...THE ZONE FORECASTS 
FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE UPDATED TO DECREASE RAIN CHANCES FOR 
TONIGHT.

.MARINE...
FREQUENT LIGHTNING...WIND GUSTS NEAR 30 KNOTS...AND LOCALLY ROUGH 
SEAS ARE LIKELY NEAR THUNDERSTORMS ON THE OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTHEAST 
OF THE UPPER KEYS UNTIL ABOUT MIDNIGHT. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IS IN 
EFFECT FOR WATERS NORTH...WEST AND SOUTHWEST OF THE LOWER KEYS DUE 
TO WEST TO NORTHWEST SWELL INCREASING TO 5 TO 7 FEET LATE TONIGHT. 
SMALL CRAFT ARE URGED TO EXERCISE CAUTION ON ALL REMAINING KEYS 
WATERS DUE TO WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS. THE 
AFOREMENTIONED SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL MOST LIKELY NEED TO BE 
EXTENDED INTO WEDNESDAY OR POSSIBLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  

&&

.AVIATION...
LIGHT RAIN WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY 
WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. PATCHY SHOWERS WITH MVFR CIGS 
AND VSBYS WILL BE EMBEDDED IN THE GENERAL RAIN AREA. 

THE RAIN WILL TAPER OFF FROM THE WEST OVERNIGHT. SKIES WILL REMAIN 
CLOUDY HOWEVER. THROUGH 00Z/27 WE EXPECT OUR SURFACE WINDS TO 
INCREASE TO AROUND 15 KNOTS FROM THE NORTHWEST. THIS WILL RESULT IN 
CROSSWINDS OF AROUND 10 KNOTS ON OUR EAST-WEST RUNWAYS.

400 PM EST MON DEC 25 2006

...A SQUALL LINE WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...SOME POSSIBLY
STRONG...IS ON SCHEDULE TO CROSS THE KEYS TONIGHT...
...COOLER AND LESS HUMID WEATHER STILL EXPECTED TO GET HERE BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A SQUALL LINE CONTAINING SOLID CONVECTION EXTENDS SSW OVER GULF OF 
MEXICO WATERS NW THROUGH W OF KEY WEST...THENCE TO THE NW COAST OF 
CUBA. MULTIPLE SMALL BOW ECHOES ARE SEEN ON STRONGEST CLUSTERS 
WITHIN THE LINE NW THROUGH SW OF KEY WEST. DOPPLER RADAR HAS ALERTED 
FOR MULTIPLE MESOCYCLONES...AND ONE TVS (DUE W OF KEY WEST MOVING 
NE) DURING THE PAST HOUR OR SO. BASE VELOCITIES OF 45 KT OR MORE  
WERE SEEN IN THE MESO-OUTFLOWS...THE STRONGEST OF WHICH IS PASSING 
JUST NW OF KEY WEST AT THIS TIME. THE BACK EDGE OF THE MAIN 
CONVECTION IS ENTERING WATERS AROUND THE DRY TORTUGAS NOW. FATHER 
WEST OVER THE GULF...OVERCAST TO BROKEN LOWER CLOUDS ARE IDENTIFIED 
ON IR SATELLITE. THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT IS NOT FAR FROM THE BACK EDGE 
OF THE MAIN WIDTH OF THE CONVECTIVE BAND. A GERMAN VESSEL THERE 
REPORTED WEST WINDS NEAR 20 KT IN THE GULF WEST OF DRY TORTUGAS. 

.FORECAST...
NEAR TERM CONCERNS OF THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...ITS PRECEDING SQUALL 
LINE...AND SUBSEQUENT WINDS ALONG AND BEHIND THE FRONT ARE BEING 
CLOSELY MET SO FAR WITH ONGOING FORECASTS AND NOT MUCH CHANGE IS 
BEING MADE. A WEAK SECONDARY TROUGH TUESDAY SWINGING SE OVER FLORIDA 
MAY KEEP WINDS EVEN MORE WESTERLY (SAY W TO NW) THAN ORIGINALLY 
THOUGHT AND THIS WOULD TEND TO KEEP CLOUD COVER MORE PERSISTENT
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AS ALREADY ADDRESSED ALONG WITH A BIT 
LESS INITIAL COOLING DURING TUE.

BEYOND THAT...DRYING FINALLY AT 850 MB AND ABOVE SHOULD COME SOUTH  
OFF THE MAINLAND DURING WED FOR ALL THE KEYS (IF NOT LATE TUE NIGHT 
FOR THE UPPER KEYS) WITH COOLER TEMPS 60-65F LATE TUE NIGHT. 
SOME SUN STILL IS SEEN WED WITH HIGHS BELOW NORMAL...GUIDANCE IS 
STUCK ON 70F. 

NO CHANGE TO FORECAST REASONING IS SEEN THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
WITH HIGH PRESSURE EXPANDING TO OUR NORTH THEN MOVING OVER THE NW 
ATLANTIC...PUMPING UP WIND SPEEDS LATE THU OR THU NIGHT FROM THE NE 
TO E...CONTINUING BREEZY FRI INTO SAT. 

LATEST EXTENDED GFS HAS A WEAK FRONT SUNDAY...BUT THIS IS UNCERTAIN 
AT THIS EARLY TIME. 
&&

.MARINE...
STAY IN PORT THROUGH THE EVENING AS A LINE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IS ON SCHEDULE TO MOVE EAST OVER THE KEYS...WITH
LIGHTNING AND STRONG WIND GUSTS. 

NW WINDS WILL VARY IN SPEED LATE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...DUE TO 
PRESSURE PULSES...BUT I WILL CAUTION SMALL CRAFT OPERATORS FOR 15-20 
KT WINDS AT TIMES. A W TO NW SWELL 7 FT...MAYBE UP TO 9 OR 10 FT...
IS EXPECTED TO COME OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO INTO WATERS NW OF THE 
LOWER KEYS...AND PROPAGATE EAST THROUGH THE STRAITS SOUTH OF DRY

...A FEW STRONG THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE LATE TODAY AND EARLY          
   TONIGHT...
...COOLER AND LESS HUMID WEATHER EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A COLD FRONT HAS MADE FAST PROGRESS EAST OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO 
OVERNIGHT...AND AT 10 AM WAS ANALYZED FROM JUST EAST OF 
APALACHICOLA, FLORIDA, EXTENDING SSW TO NE YUCATAN. A LINE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PRECEDES THE FRONT WITHIN A HUNDRED MILES 
OR SO...AND CONVECTION ALONG THIS LINE IS SOLID FROM NORTH FLORIDA 
SOUTHWARD ALL THE WAY TO SE GULF WATERS DUE WEST OF THE FLORIDA KEYS.
SCATTERED CONVECTION INCLUDING SOME NEW THUNDERSTORMS CELLS CONTINUE 
SOUTHWARD JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT INTO THE NW CARIBBEAN. SOUTH WINDS 
OVER THE KEYS ARE RUNNING SOME 5 KT OVER WHAT ALL MODELS HAVE 
INDICATED FOR THIS TIME. C-MAN STATIONS ON THE REEF AND BAY REPORT
SUSTAINED 10-METER SPEEDS IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE WITH GUSTS TO 25 KT 
OR A BIT MORE. A MORNING QUIKSCAT SATELLITE PASS REPORTED WINDS 
ALMOST UP TO 20 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS. WE REMAIN VERY WARM AND HUMID 
AT THE SURFACE...AND THE MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS AN INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE DEPTH. GOES SOUNDER DATA SHOW DEEPENING MOISTURE JUST TO 
OUR WEST AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT. 

.FORECAST...
WHILE STRONGEST DYNAMICS AND LOW LEVEL FORCING WITHIN THE SQUALL 
LINE ARE FOCUSED MORE ON AREAS TO OUR NORTH...SUFFICIENT FACTORS AND 
RECENT SATELLITE AND RADAR TRENDS STILL SEEM TO SUPPORT SUSTAINED 
SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AT THE KEYS LATITUDE.
EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE CURRENT CONVECTION...BASED ON LONG-RANGE 
RADAR AND SATELLITE EXTRAPOLATION...APPROXIMATELY PLACES THE MAIN
CONVECTIVE LINE INTO DRY TORTUGAS MAYBE 2-3 PM...AND TO NEAR THE 
LOWER KEYS MAYBE 6 PM. HOWEVER...THERE IS EVIDENCE FOR DEVELOPMENT
OF INDEPENDENT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EAST OF AND SEGREGATED FROM 
THE MAIN CONVECTIVE LINE...WHICH WOULD POSE A THREAT OF SOME 
SHOWER-RELATED WEATHER INTO THE KEYS EARLIER THAN THE TIME FOR THE 
EXTRAPOLATED SQUALL LINE ITSELF. PUBLIC ZONES EXPRESS THIS TREND AND 
AN UPDATE WILL BE MADE JUST FOR AFTERNOON TRANSITIONAL WORDING. 

LIGHTNING WITH ALL STORMS...AND STRONG WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
MAIN CONVECTIVE CORES AND BOW-ECHOES...STILL SEEM TO BE THE MAIN 
THREATS. 
&&

.MARINE...
SMALL CRAFT NEED TO EXERCISE CAUTION ON ALL KEYS WATERS DUE TO 
SUSTAINED WINDS 15-20 KT FROM THE SOUTH TURNING TO SOUTHWEST. 
HOWEVER...MORE HAZARDOUS CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL SPREAD EAST OVER KEYS WATERS THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...WITH LIGHTNING, LOCAL STRONG GUSTY WINDS, AND ROUGHER 
LOCAL SEAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONGER STORMS. A NEAR-SOLID SQUALL 
LINE AT 10 AM WAS OVER GULF WATERS WEST OF DRY TORTUGAS HEADING 
EAST...AND SHOULD GET TO DRY TORTUGAS BY 2-3 PM...THE LOWER KEYS 
MAYBE 5-6 PM...AND OTHER KEYS SHORTLY THEREAFTER. HOWEVER...PLAN TO 
BE IN SAFE WATERS PRIOR TO THEN AS TIMING IS ESTIMATED...AND OTHER 
SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY WELL FORM OUT AHEAD OF THE MAIN SQUALL LINE. 

WE WILL PROBABLY BE ISSUING SPECIAL MARINE WARNINGS FOR THUNDERSTORM 
WIND GUSTS FOR KEYS WATERS BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON THROUGH EVENING. 
&&

.AVIATION...
A COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE KEYS AND THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
TONIGHT. PRIOR TO THIS...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE ROUTE 
WELL INTO THE AFTERNOON...WITH ONLY ISOLATED SMALL SHOWERS PRODUCING 
BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS. AS THE FRONT APPROACHES...A LINE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL APPROACH THE ROUTE LATE THIS  
AFTERNOON OR EVENING. THE EXACT TIMING OF THIS LINE AFFECTING THE 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS RELATIVE STRENGTH OF THE EMBEDDED CELLS AT THAT 
TIME...IS STILL SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN.

SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE SOUTH SOUTHEAST AT 12 TO 16 
KT WITH OCCASIONAL GUSTS THIS MORNING...RESULTING IN PERIODS OF 10 
KT CROSSWINDS AT BOTH TERMINALS. WINDS WILL THEN TURN THROUGH SOUTH 
TO SOUTHWEST AT A BIT LOWER SPEEDS BY THIS EVENING...BEFORE BECOMING 
NORTHWEST BEHIND THE FRONT LATER TONIGHT.

355 AM EST MON DEC 25 2006

...A FEW STRONG THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE LATE TODAY AND EARLY          
   TONIGHT...
...COOLER AND LESS HUMID WEATHER EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A MODERATE SOUTHEAST BREEZE IS NOW IN PLACE ACROSS THE SERVICE 
AREA...WITH OCCASIONALLY FRESH GUSTS NOTED AT A FEW OF THE CMAN 
SENSORS ALIGNED ALONG THE KEYS. SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY FOR THE MOST 
PART...ALTHOUGH BOTH EYW AND MTH OBSERVATIONS HAVE SHOWN LOW 
CEILINGS BRIEFLY OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. EARLY MORNING IR SATELLITE 
LOOP SHOWS THESE SCATTERED LOWER CLOUDS EXTENDING SOUTH AND 
SOUTHEAST OF THE ISLAND CHAIN. TEMPERATURES ARE QUITE WARM...IN THE 
UPPER 70S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 70S. KBYX RADAR 
INDICATES ONLY A FEW SHALLOW ECHOES CURRENTLY IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
ADJACENT TO THE MIDDLE KEYS...AND EVEN WEAKER RETURNS IN THE FLORIDA 
BAY.

.FORECAST...
THE CENTER OF STRENGTHENING LOW PRESSURE HAS PULLED INLAND FROM THE 
GULF COAST...WITH A COLD FRONT NOW EXTENDING FROM NEAR THE 
FLORIDA/ALABAMA LINE SOUTH/SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE EAST-CENTRAL 
GULF OF MEXICO TO THE YUCATAN PENINSULA. AN ACTIVE STRETCH OF 
THUNDERSTORMS IS EVIDENT FROM THE FRONT IN THE EASTERN GULF TOWARD 
THE BIG BEND AREA OF THE FLORIDA GULF COAST.

OVERALL FORECAST REASONING HAS NOT CHANGED CONCERNING THE EXPECTED 
WEATHER THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON AND LATE EVENING/EARLY TONIGHT FOR 
THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. THE NAM DID NOT INITIALIZE WELL 
WITH THE SOUTHWARD EXTENSION OF THE CONVECTION CURRENTLY IN THE 
GULF...AND SEEMS TO LAG EXCESSIVE MOISTURE IN THE GULF ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF THE FRONT THROUGH 48 HOURS. IT ALSO IS QUITE LOWER ON POP 
VALUES THROUGH LATE THIS EVENING/EARLY TONIGHT WHEN COMPARED TO THE 
MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE GFS NUMBERS...AND IN FACT HAS A HIGHER 12 HOUR 
POP FOR BOTH EYW AND MTH DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY. I WILL CONTINUE 
TO FAVOR THE SOMEWHAT MORE CONSISTENT GFS NUMBERS. THERE ARE A FEW 
SUBTLE DIFFERENCES ON THIS LATEST RUN THOUGH. ALTHOUGH THE TIMING OF 
THE FRONTAL PASSAGE IS VERY NEAR PREVIOUS RUNS...THE INSTABILITY AND 
WIND PROFILE ARE NOT AS FAVORABLE AS BEFORE DURING WHAT SHOULD BE 
THE PEAK CONVECTIVE TIME. AND THE UPPER LEVEL JET IS SIGNIFICANTLY 
FURTHER WEST THAN ON ITS RUN 24 HOURS AGO. THAT IS NOT TO SAY THAT A 
FEW STRONG THUNDERSTORMS ARE OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR LATE THIS 
EVENING AND EARLY TONIGHT. WILL LEAVE THE MENTION OF STRONG WINDS 
NEAR TSTMS IN THE TONIGHT PERIOD. ALTHOUGH THE FRONT IS FORECAST TO 
CROSS THE ENTIRE STRETCH OF THE KEYS BETWEEN 8 PM THIS EVENING AND 
ROUGHLY 2 AM TUESDAY...A TRAILING WEAK SURFACE TROUGH WILL DELAY THE 
ONSET OF MORE PRONOUNCED NORTHWEST WINDS UNTIL THE DAYTIME HOURS ON 
TUESDAY. THUS...MOS TEMPERATURES TONIGHT ARE NOT AS COOL AS PREVIOUS 
RUNS. HAVE MADE SOME PRELIMINARY UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO THOSE 
GRIDS...BUT MAY INDEED BUMP THEM HIGHER AT THE VERY LAST MINUTE 
BEFORE ZONE ISSUANCE. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS THIS MORNING GIVES 
WAY TO A GOOD CHANCE THIS AFTERNOON WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. CAN 
NOT ARGUE WITH THE CATEGORICAL NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT (GFS 12 HOUR MOS 
NUMBERS ARE 98 AND 96 PERCENT FOR EYW AND MTH RESPECTIVELY) ...AND A 
30 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH TUESDAY LOOKS GOOD THANKS TO 
THAT TRAILING TROUGH AND RESIDUAL MOISTURE.

NO CHANGES TO THE GRIDS BEYOND TUESDAY. THE COOLEST DAYTIME PERIOD 
SHOULD BE WEDNESDAY...WITH HIGHS ONLY AROUND THE 70 DEGREE 
MARK...AND THEN A MODERATING TREND BACK ABOVE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES 
IS IN STORE FOR THURSDAY AND THE NEW YEAR WEEKEND.

&&

.MARINE...
WILL KEEP AN EXERCISE CAUTION UP FOR ALL OF THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
TODAY...EVEN THOUGH THERE MAY BE A SHORT PERIOD LULL IN THE WIND 
SPEEDS FOR THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS JUST PRIOR TO THE FRONT. AT 
THIS TIME...5 TO 7 FOOT LONGER PERIOD SWELLS ARE EXPECTED LATE 
TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY IN THE WATERS TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST OF 
THE LOWER KEYS...BUT MY CONFIDENCE IS SUCH THAT I WILL ALLOW THE 
LATER SHIFTS THE OPTION OF RAISING A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR THOSE 
PERIODS ACROSS THOSE WATERS. MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH BREEZES 
WILL TURN THROUGH THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST ON WEDNESDAY...AND BE 
MAINLY EAST BY EARLY FRIDAY.

&&

.AVIATION...
THE MAIN IMPACTS TO THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE WILL BE 
PATCHES OF MVFR CEILINGS WITH A FEW EMBEDDED SHOWERS STREAMING 
NORTHWESTWARD MAINLY OVER THE MARINE PORTION OF THE ROUTE. BOTH KEYS 
TERMINALS WILL BE PERIODICALLY AFFECTED BY THESE CEILINGS THIS 
MORNING. AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL RESULT IN INCREASING CLOUD 
COVER OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY. EXPECT MOSTLY VFR CEILINGS THIS 
AFTERNOON. AS THE FRONT DRAWS NEARER THE KEYS LATER THIS AFTERNOON 
SCATTERED MVFR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO 
ENTER THE ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY TURN FROM THE CURRENT 
SOUTHEASTERLY AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS...TO SOUTHWESTERLY. AS THE FRONT 
PUSHES THROUGH TONIGHT...WINDS WILL SHIFT TO WESTERLY...AND 
THEREAFTER RAIN COVERAGE AND INTENSITY WILL DIMINISH.

.CURRENTLY...  
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST NEAR 15 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 20 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE 
IN THE UPPER 70S. ONLY ABOUT THREE DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED 
OVERNIGHT DUE TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S.

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
AN INTENSIFYING AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE FROM THE NORTHWEST 
GULF OF MEXICO...NORTHEASTWARD...OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES 
TONIGHT. THE ASSOCIATED TRAILING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO TONIGHT. FARTHER EAST...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE NEAR THE BAHAMAS WILL BEGIN TO RETREAT EASTWARD 
TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE AND MOIST FOR THIS 
TIME OF YEAR...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUE JUST ABOVE ONE 
AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN CONSTANT 
TONIGHT. DESPITE ADEQUATE INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE IN PLACE FOR 
CONVECTION...LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT WILL LIMIT POPS TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE CATEGORY FOR TONIGHT. THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE 
FLORIDA KEYS HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...SO NO UPDATES ARE 
EXPECTED. 

A ROBUST COLD FRONT IS POISED TO MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS MONDAY EVENING 
INTO MONDAY NIGHT. FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING THIS COLD 
FRONT...PLEASE REFER TO THE LATEST PUBLIC INFORMATION STATEMENT 
ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE RIGHT HERE IN KEY WEST.   

&&   

.MARINE...
SMALL CRAFT ARE URGED TO EXERCISE CAUTION ON ATLANTIC WATERS TONIGHT 
DUE TO SUSTAINED SOUTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS. IN 
ADDITION...SEAS OF 4 TO 6 FEET CAN BE EXPECTED ON ATLANTIC WATERS 
BEYOND THE REEF TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS 
MONDAY EVENING INTO MONDAY NIGHT. AN ORGANIZED SQUALL LINE MAY 
PRECEDE THIS FRONT. IF THIS IS THE CASE...MARINERS SHOULD BE 
PREPARED FOR WIND GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 35 KNOTS AHEAD OF AND ALONG THE

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT ALONG THE FLIGHT ROUTE MIAMI TO

TRAFFIC-CONTROL RADARS WILL BE BUSY...TRACKING YOU-KNOW-WHO. 

&&

.CLIMATE...
THE LOW TEMPERATURE AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT SO FAR TODAY 
IS 76 DEGREES. IF THIS HOLDS TRUE THROUGH MIDNIGHT...AS SEEMS 
LIKELY...IT WILL TIE THE RECORD WARM MINIMUM TEMPERATURE FOR THE

WHICH THE RECORD WARM MINIMUM TEMPERATURE HAS BEEN TIED OR BROKEN 
AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. 

THE HIGH TEMPERATURE TODAY AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT WAS 83 
DEGREES. THIS IS THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL 
AIRPORT IN THE MONTH OF DECEMBER SINCE 2004...WHEN 83 DEGREES WAS 
RECORDED ON DECEMBER 9TH.

...THUNDERSTORMS REMAIN IN THE FLORIDA KEYS FORECAST FOR LATE 
CHRISTMAS DAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...
...LIGHTNING AND POSSIBLE STRONG GUSTY WINDS POSE HAZARDS WITH 
STORMS... 
...COOLER AND LESS HUMID WEATHER EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A WARM AND TRANQUIL TROPICAL AIRMASS HAS PERSISTED OVER THE KEYS
THROUGH THE DAY. JUST A FEW SPOTTY SHOWERS ARE NOTED ALONG WITH
MOSTLY FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS GROWTH. WE GOT WARM ON THE ISLANDS 
TODAY. CHECK OUT SOME FACTS ON THE CLIMATE SECTION BELOW. 
AREA WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING FROM THE SE IN THE 10-15 KT RANGE...
EXCEPT SOME C-MAN SITES ON THE REEF AND A FEW SHIP OBSERVATIONS
WERE ACTUALLY CLOSER TO 15 KT THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. 

LOOKING UPSTREAM TO OUR WEST FOR WEATHER HEADED THIS WAY...LOW 
PRESSURE HAS CONTINUED TO TAKE SHAPE TODAY OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...AND THE LOW CENTER IS NOW ANALYZED WITH SATELLITE AND 
MOORED BUOY DATA ABOUT 260 MILES ENE OF BROWNSVILLE, TEXAS. 
SIGNIFICANT THUNDERSTORM ORGANIZATION REMAINS ALONG AND NORTH OF THE 
WARM FRONT THAT STRETCHES FROM THE LOW CENTER EAST TO CENTRAL 
FLORIDA...WHILE A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS IS ALONG THE LOWS 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH INTO THE BAY OF CAMPECHE. 

.FORECAST...
THE UPCOMING AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE MAINTAINS STRONG CONTINUITY 
WITH ONGOING FORECASTS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...BASED ON THE MORE 
CONSISTENT GFS MODEL. THE 06Z AND 12Z RUNS OF THE NAM-ETA HAVE THROWN
US A CURVE...SHOWING A MUCH SLOWER ARRIVAL OF THE COLD FRONT INTO 
THE KEYS (DURING TUESDAY). I AM STICKING WITH THE GFSS INDICATIONS 
OF A FRONTAL PASSAGE FOR THE KEYS MONDAY NIGHT...PRECEDED BY 
SIGNIFICANT CONVECTION AND POSSIBLY EVEN AN ORGANIZED SQUALL 
LINE.

TONIGHT...WARM SOUTHEAST WINDS AND JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS
WILL REMAIN THE FORECAST AS WE STAY IN LARGELY UNDISTURBED TROPICAL 
AIR. A FEW TCU LINES MOVING IN FROM THE SE HAVE SMALL SHOWERS. LOWS 
IN THE MID 70S ARE AGAIN RECORD-BOOK MATERIAL FOR WARM MIN TEMPS 
BEFORE MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 

MONDAY...MODELS STILL SUGGEST A SQUALL LINE FORMING OVER THE EASTERN 
GULF DURING THE DAY...AND ITS SOUTHERN EXTENT MAY GO WELL SOUTH OF 
THE KEYS LATITUDE THUS SETTING UP FOR A SWEEP OF THE AREA 
EVENTUALLY. TIMING IS MAINLY POINTING TO KEYS WATERS WEST OF KEY 
WEST DURING THE DAY...BUT MAY ARRIVE A LOWER KEYS BEFORE AFTERNOON 
IS OVER. ALSO...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF A SQUALL LINE MAY 
FORM AND MOVE NORTH OVER THE KEYS PRIOR TO AFTERNOONS END. 50 PCT 
POPS ARE CARRIED. 

MONDAY NIGHT...GFS AND EUROPEAN AND UKMET MODELS SUGGEST THE MAIN
CONVECTIVE PARAMETERS WILL AFFECT THE KEYS DURING THE EVENING AND/OR 
OVERNIGHT. I HAVE RAISED POPS TO 80 PCT...AND ADDED MENTION OF 
WIND GUST THREAT. STRONG HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE...A MID LEVEL TROUGH 
AXIS THAT DIPS SOUTH EVEN TO YUCATAN...SURFACE CONVERGENCE...AND
HIGH MOISTURE AND HEAT CONTENT OF THE PRECEDING AIRMASS MAY 
CONTRIBUTE TO THIS CONVECTIVE EVENT. 

TUESDAY...A NW FLOW BEHIND THE FRONT...AND A SECONDARY SURFACE 
TROUGH SWING SOUTH OVER FLORIDA DURING THE DAY TUESDAY...MAY 
KEEP A PRONOUNCED NW COMPONENT OF LOW LEVEL WINDS GOING THROUGH THE 
DAY. COOL ADVECTION AND ASSOCIATED CLOUDS THEN SHOULD AFFECT THE 
KEYS...AND I INDICATED A MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY. SHOWERS MAY LINGER 
ESPECIALLY EARLY. COOLER TEMPS MAY HOLD STEADY IN THE LOWER 70S 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. 

TUESDAY NIGHT...FINALLY A TURN OF WINDS TO N LATE AT NIGHT...AND
GFS INDICATIONS OF DRYING IN THE 100-850 MB LEVEL COMING OFF THE 
MAINLAND AND OVER THE KEYS...SHOULD GRADUALLY THIN OUT CLOUDS 
OVERNIGHT. NO CHANGE TO FORECAST LOWS NEAR 60...BUT COULD BE
55-58 FOR UPPER KEYS.

WED-WED NIGHT...DRY AIR AT LOWER LEVELS OUGHT TO KEEP SKY COVER 
LIMITED. WINDS MAY TURN TO NE DURING WED NIGHT WITH STRATOCU MOVING 
BACK IN. COOL. 

THU-SAT...HIGH PRESSURE WELL TO OUR NORTH IS SHOWN TO EXPAND...AND
THIS MAY INCREASE KEYS WINDS SOME AS WIND DIRECTION TURNS TO NE THEN 
E...ESPECIALLY FRIDAY AND SAT. A WARM UP IS IN STORE. 
&&

.MARINE...
THE FRONT IS ON TRACK FOR A STILL-ESTIMATED ARRIVAL MON NIGHT.
BOATERS HOWEVER SHOULD MAKE PLANS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MOVING EAST  TO GULF AND DRY TORTUGAS WATERS DURING THE DAY MONDAY...
REACHING PARTS OF THE KEYS MAYBE BY LATER IN THE DAY BUT CERTAINLY
BY THE OVERNIGHT PERIODS MONDAY NIGHT. THERE MAY BE AN ORGANIZED 
SQUALL LINE...AND THIS WOULD CAUSE SPECIAL MARINE WARNINGS TO BE 
ISSUED STARTING OVER WESTERN WATERS MONDAY...GOING FOR ALL OTHER 
WATERS MONDAY NIGHT. 

THE FRONT WILL BRING A SHIFT OF WINDS TO NW 15 KT AND GUSTY MON 
NIGHT INTO TUE...BUT A LOW PRESSURE AREA TO OUR NORTH COULD PUSH 
WINDS HIGHER MON NIGHT AND TUE...SAY 15-20 KT AND GUSTY. 

LOOK FOR TURN TO N AND NE WINDS...NEAR 15 KT OR MAYBE A BIT LESS OVER
BAY AND NEARSHORE WATERS WED. STRONG HIGH PRESSURE TAKING OVER THU 
INTO FRI MAY BOOST NE TO E WINDS UP INTO THE 15-20 KT RANGE. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
TONIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL 
PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS 
AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE MAINLY SOUTHEAST AT 7-10 KT.

.CLIMATE...
THE LOW TEMPERATURE AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT THIS MORNING 
WAS 76 DEGREES...AND THE HIGH TEMPERATURE SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON HAS 
BEEN 83 DEGREES. THIS IS THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE REACHED IN KEY WEST 
SINCE NOVEMBER 15...AND THE HIGHEST TEMPERATURE IN THE MONTH OF 
DECEMBER SINCE 2004...WHEN 83 DEGREES WAS RECORDED ON DECEMBER 9. 

TODAY HAS ALSO BEEN THE WARMEST CHRISTMAS EVE OR CHRISTMAS DAY IN 
KEY WEST IN AT LEAST 50 YEARS. THE LAST TIME THE HIGH TEMPERATURE 
REACHED 83 DEGREES ON THE 24TH OR 25TH OF DECEMBER WAS ON CHRISTMAS 
EVE IN 1956. THE LAST TIME THE AVERAGE TEMPERATURE ON THE 24TH OR

330 AM EST SUN DEC 24 2006

...THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE LATE CHRISTMAS DAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...
...COOLER AND LESS HUMID WEATHER EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A FRONT IS CURRENTLY STRETCHED ACROSS NORTHERN FLORIDA AND ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN GULF...AND TOWARD A DEVELOPING AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IN 
THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THE LOCAL AREA IS ON THE WESTERN EXTENT 
OF WEAKENING HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE ATLANTIC. AS SUCH...WINDS ARE 
GENTLE TO MODERATE OUT OF THE EAST/SOUTHEAST. THE KEYS ARE UNDER 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES...AND RAIN ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR ARE LIMITED TO A 
FEW CELLS IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT TO THE UPPER KEYS...AND A 
FEW HEAVIER RETURNS WELL OUT IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS.

.FORECAST...
FORECAST REASONING HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY THROUGH THE 
DURATION OF THIS HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL STRENGTHEN AS IT PULLS THROUGH THE GULF 
AND IS NEAR THE AL/FL COAST BY TONIGHT. THERE HAS BEEN MODEL AND RUN 
TO RUN INCONSISTENCY ABOUT THE STRENGTH AND COURSE OF THIS STORM AS 
IT PROGRESSES TO THE NORTHEAST. THERE HAS BEEN WAFFLING BETWEEN A 
TRACK CLOSE TO THE OHIO VALLEY...AND MORE RECENTLY A COMPLEX SURFACE 
PATTERN CLOSER TO THE ATLANTIC COAST. NONETHELESS...FOR THE LOCAL 
AREA A TRAILING COLD FRONT IS STILL FORECAST TO CROSS THE KEYS VERY 
LATE MONDAY EVENING OR MONDAY NIGHT. THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING ON MONDAY AHEAD OF THIS TRAILING FRONT...AND THE 
SHORT RANGE MODELS ARE NOW ZEROING IN ON MONDAY NIGHT AS THE PEAK OF 
SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY FOR EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
KEYS. THIS SEEMS REASONABLE THANKS TO THE POSITION OF UPPER JET 
REACHING FROM THE EASTERN GULF INTO THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC...AND 
AN UNSTABLE SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW INCREASING FROM THE 
SOUTH/SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION.MOS NUMBERS ARE ALL GOING LIKELY FOR 
THAT PERIOD AND CONFIDENCE IN NOW HIGH ENOUGH TO NUDGE OUR POPS UP 
INTO THAT RANGE. UNTIL THEN...THERE WERE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO 
TEMPERATURE AND DEWPOINT GRIDS. A PERSISTENT MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL 
KEEP RAIN CHANCES MINIMAL FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT DESPITE PLENTY OF 
MOISTURE THROUGH ROUGHLY 10 KFT. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN WELL ABOVE 
NORMAL THROUGH CHRISTMAS...AND A NOTICEABLE COOL DOWN WILL BE FELT 
FROM TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS MUCH DRIER AIR WORKS IN. BUT A 
MODERATING TREND BACK TOWARDS NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND RAIN CHANCE IS 
SET FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS A RETURN EASTERLY FLOW BECOMES 
RE-ESTABLISHED. THERE MAY BE A WIND SURGE FROM THE EAST ON FRIDAY AS 
HIGH PRESSURE EXPANDS INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TO OUR NORTH AND

RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA TONIGHT. IN 
THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BE LOCATED OVER THE BAHAMAS TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS 
UNSTABLE AND MOIST FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER 
(PWAT) VALUE JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH. ATMOSPHERIC 
MOISTURE SHOULD INCREASE TONIGHT. BY SUNRISE SUNDAY...PWAT VALUES 
SHOULD BE JUST UNDER ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH. DESPITE 
ADEQUATE INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE IN PLACE FOR CONVECTION...LACK OF

...WEATHER PATTERNS CONTINUE TO SHOW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN
   THE FORECAST FOR CHRISTMAS DAY AND NIGHT FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS... 
...COOLER AND LESS HUMID WEATHER IS SEEN FOR MID TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...


.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...  
A FRONTAL SYSTEM DIVIDING WARM AND HUMID AIR OVER THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA AND EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO FROM A COOL AND DRY CONTINENTAL 
AIRMASS OVER THE NORTHERN GULF COAST CONTINUES TO STALL OUT FROM 
NORTH FLORIDA...THENCE ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO TO NE MEXICO. A 
WEAK SURFACE TROUGH THAT HAD PRECEDED THIS FRONT IS NOW JUST ABOUT 
FADED AWAY FROM  LAKE OKEECHOBEE INTO THE SE GULF OF MEXICO 
WEST OF THE KEYS AREA. AN OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARY THIS MORNING THAT HAD 
MIGRATED EAST INTO THE KEYS...REACHED KEY WEST AND FLORIDA BAY...
BUT HAS NOW JUST ABOUT LOST IDENTITY. THERE IS SOME REMNANT OF THIS 
OUTFLOW STILL IN THE STRAITS SOUTH OF KEY WEST TO SOUTH OF DRY 
TORTUGAS. ELSEWHERE OVER THE KEYS...THE WESTERN EXTENSION OF THE 
ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE NW BAHAMAS TO NEAR THE UPPER 
KEYS AND EXTREME S FLORIDA PENINSULA...PROVIDING A SE TO S WIND FLOW 
FOR KEYS AREAS EAST OF THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY. WIND SPEEDS HAVE 
DECREASED FROM THIS MORNING...NOW RUNNING NEAR 10 KT OR LESS AT WIND 
GAGES ON THE REEF. PULASKI SHOAL C-MAN...STILL WITHIN THE DYING 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY WINDS...HAS WINDS FLOPPING AROUND NE TO E. WARM AND 
HUMID AIR HAS CREATED SOME CUMULUS LINES OFF THE KEYS ISLANDS...
BUT SHOWERS ARE LIMITED. 

.FORECAST...
LATEST MODEL OUTPUT IS AT LEAST CONSISTENT WITH A FRONTAL PASSAGE 
OVER THE KEYS BY MONDAY EVENING OR MONDAY NIGHT...BRING A SHIFT OF 
WINDS TO NORTHWEST AND FOLLOWED BY COOLER WEATHER LATE MONDAY NIGHT 
ON THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. IT STILL APPEARS THAT SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE WILL AFFECT THE REGION MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT 
AHEAD OF AND ALONG THE FRONT. 

TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...AN ERRATIC WIND PATTERN NEAR THE 
LOWER KEYS AND WEST OF HERE SHOULD SETTLE BACK INTO A SE WIND FLOW 
TONIGHT AS WILL BE THE CASE OVER ALL THE KEYS. LOW CHANCE OF RAIN IS 
INDICATED EACH PERIOD DUE TO LACK OF WELL DEFINED SHOWER TRIGGERS...
BUT IT WILL STAY QUITE WARM AND HUMID. WATCH FOR A POSSIBLE RECORD 
WARM MINIMUM TEMPERATURE TONIGHT. WINDS SHOULD TURN MORE SOUTH LATE 
SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT WITH A PICK UP IN SPEED INTO THE 10-15 MPH 
RANGE AS LOW PRESSURE BEGINS TO FORM OVER THE NW GULF OF MEXICO. 

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...MODELS SHOW A WELL-DEFINED DIVERGENT FLOW 
AND STRONG JET DYNAMICS SETTING UP OVER THE EASTERN GULF AND MOVING 
OVER FLORIDA. AT THE SAME TIME...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO 
DEEPEN STRONGLY OVER THE SE STATES. BOTH MOIST AND SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE 
LOW LEVEL FLOW FROM THE S TO SW SHOULD SWOOP OVER FLORIDA AND THE 
KEYS...WHILE ALOFT SIGNIFICANT LIFT FIELDS FORM AND MOVE OVER THE 
REGION AS WELL. LATE MONDAY AND CONTINUING INTO MON NIGHT SEEMS THE 
BEST TIMING FOR ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO AFFECT THE KEYS. I HAVE NOT 
RAISED POPS OVER 50 PCT AS GFS MOS MAINTAINS THESE VALUES...BUT 
AN INCREASE TO LIKELY CATEGORY MAY BE NEEDED. WATCH FOR POSSIBLE
SIGNIFICANT WIND GUSTS. 

TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...CONDITIONS MAY BE BREEZY...DEPENDING ON 
STRENGTH OF THE LOW PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH. AT ANY RATE...TEMPS SHOULD
GO MAYBE 10 DEGREES COOLER THAN PRESENT TRENDS. CLOUDS OFF THE GULF 
MAY PERSIST TUE WITH SOME SHOWERS...BUT A DECREASING CLOUD TREND 
OUGHT TO SET IN AT LEAST TUE NIGHT WITH OFF-MAINLAND FLOW. I LOWER 
MIN TEMPS A BIT. 

WED-WED NIGHT....DRY NNE TO NE FLOW SHOULD LIMIT CLOUDS. WINDS MAY 
STAY UP WED AS WELL. LOOK FOR COOLEST TEMPS WED NIGHT INTO THU 
MORNING. 

THU-SAT...A GRADUAL TURN OF WINDS TO NE THEN E GIVES A MODERATING 
WEATHER TREND...WITH SOME MOISTURE PERHAPS AIDING A FEW SHOWERS. 
WIND SPEEDS MAY PUMP UP SOME THU AS HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH 
EXPANDS. 
&&

.MARINE...
A SE WIND FLOW NEAR 10 KT SHOULD SET IN ON MOST KEYS WATERS 
OVERNIGHT. SE WINDS COMING UP INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE SUN AND SUN 
NIGHT...WILL GO SW AND GET TO 15 KT OR MORE MON. WATCH FOR SHOWERS 
AND STORMS MON AND MON NIGHT AS WELL. 

A COLD FRONT WILL SHIFT WINDS TO NW 15 KT AND GUSTY MON NIGHT 
CONTINUING TUE...BUT IF LOW PRESSURE DEEPENS MORE THAN EXPECTED OR A 
BIT FATHER SOUTH OVER THE SE STATES...KEYS WINDS FORECAST MAY NEED 
RAISING INTO 15-20 KT OR NEAR 20 KT RANGE. ANOTHER NOTE...STRONGER
WINDS OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTH GULF MAY DRIVE HIGHER SWELLS INTO 
KEYS GULF WATERS AND WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
OVERNIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL 
PRODUCE LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE...AND BRIEF IFR 
VISIBILITIES IN HEAVIER CELLS. LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS WILL ALSO AFFECT 
THE ROUTE OUTSIDE OF SHOWER ACTIVITY...AND SOME CEILING HEIGHTS WILL 
BE JUST ABOVE THE IFR THRESHOLD AT 1000-1200 FT AGL. WINDS AT KEYW

SOUTHEAST AT LESS THAN 10 KT OVERNIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...  
A FRONTAL SYSTEM DIVIDING WARM AND HUMID AIR OVER THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA AND EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO FROM A COOL AND DRY CONTINENTAL 
AIRMASS OVER THE NORTHERN GULF COAST HAS JUST ABOUT STALLED THIS 
MORNING FROM THE EASTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE THENCE ACROSS THE GULF OF 
MEXICO TO NE MEXICO. A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH THAT HAD PRECEDED THIS 
FRONT IS NOW BECOMING ILL-DEFINED FROM NEAR CAPE CANAVERAL TO SW 
FLORIDA AND INTO THE EXTREME SE GULF OF MEXICO. WITHIN THE FLORIDA 
KEYS AREA....AN OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM PREVIOUS CONVECTION OVER 
THE SE GULF HAS INTERMINGLED WITH FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
ILL-DEFINED TROUGH. THIS OUTFLOW BOUNDARY IS CURRENTLY DISSIPATING 
BUT IS NOT YET TOTALLY GONE...AND AT 10 AM STRETCHED FROM SW FLORIDA 
NEAR CAPE SABLE ALMOST TO KEY WEST. NW OF THIS BOUNDARY...SURFACE 
WINDS HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED...GOING NNE THEN TO ENE THIS MORNING. 
ELSEWHERE OVER THE KEYS...THE WESTERN EXTENSION OF THE ATLANTIC 
SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE NW BAHAMAS TO NEAR THE UPPER KEYS AND 
EXTREME S FLORIDA PENINSULA...PROVIDING A SE TO S WIND FLOW FOR KEYS 
AREAS EAST OF THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY. WIND SPEEDS HAVE DECREASED THIS 
MORNING...NOW RUNNING NEAR 10 KT AT WIND GAGES ON THE REEF. THE KEY 
WEST SOUNDING THIS MORNING REVEALED A SLIGHTLY LESS WET ATMOSPHERE 
THAN 24 HOURS AGO...BUT NONETHELESS HUMID ENOUGH TO SUPPORT SHOWERS 
WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER AT 1.6 INCH. SHOWERS THAT WERE ALONG THE 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY HAVE WANED...BUT OTHER NEWLY-DEVELOPED SHOWERS HAVE 
APPEARED WITHIN THE SE TO S FLOW OVER THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS AND 
ADJACENT WATERS. VISIBLE SATELLITE REVEALS CONVERGENT CLOUD LINES 
OVER THESE AREAS. 

.FORECAST...
PEAKS OF SUNSHINE HAVE BEEN COMING THROUGH THE HIGH CLOUDS THIS 
MORNING...BUT THE SCATTERING OF SHOWERS OVER UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS 
AND THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY WITH ITS LINE OF CLOUDS MOVING INTO THE 
LOWER KEYS...SHOULD GIVE OVERALL MORE CLOUDS THAN SUN. THE CURRENT 
FORECAST OF 30 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS TODAY APPEARS REASONABLE
...AND NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES IS PLANNED UNLESS CLOUD COVER THINS 
OUT.
&&

.MARINE...
A SE TO S WIND FLOW NEAR 10 KT SHOULD STAY OVER MOST KEYS WATERS 
THIS AFTERNOON...EXCEPT FOR GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS AND 
WATERS FROM KEY WEST TO DRY TORTUGAS WHERE AN OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARY
WILL DISRUPT WINDS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. EVEN AREAS AROUND THE 
LOWER-MOST KEYS MAY SEE SOME ERRATIC WIND DIRECTIONS FOR A WHILE 
THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SPEEDS OUGHT NOT TO BE MUCH OVER 10 KT IN THOSE 
PLACES AS WELL. LOOK FOR WINDS TO GRADUALLY TURN BACK TO SE TONIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL AFFECT THE 
ROUTE...PERHAPS INCREASING TO WIDELY SCATTERED OVER THE 
MAINLAND...PRODUCING LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS AND BRIEF IFR 
VISIBILITIES IN HEAVIER RAIN. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL GENERALLY 
BE SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST AT LESS THAN 10 KT.

.CLIMATE...

THE LOW TEMPERATURE AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
YESTERDAY...DECEMBER 22...WAS 76 DEGREES. THIS TIED THE RECORD FOR 
THE WARMEST LOW TEMPERATURE ON THE DATE...PREVIOUSLY SET IN 1888. 
THE LOW TEMPERATURE AT THE AIRPORT THIS MORNING...DECEMBER 23...WAS 
AGAIN 76 DEGREES. THE RECORD FOR THE WARMEST LOW TEMPERATURE ON THIS

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...  
THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS HAS SLID TO THE EAST OF THE ISLANDS WHILE 
A LINGERING MID LEVEL WAVE HAS ITS SOUTHERN EXTENSION STILL IN THE 
SOUTHEASTERN GULF. ON KBYX RADAR...A PERSISTENT AREA OF MODERATE TO 
HEAVY SHOWERS HAS EXTENDED FROM THE CENTRAL GULF COAST OF FLORIDA 
SOUTHWESTWARD TO THE THE WATERS JUST BEYOND DRY TORTUGAS...WITH VERY 
SLOW IF ANY PROPAGATION EASTWARD. OTHERWISE...THE AIRMASS IS QUITE 
MOIST...ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWER LEVELS AND SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY 
OVER THE ISLANDS.

.FORECAST...
IN THE LOWER LAYERS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...THE ATLANTIC RIDGE THAT HAS 
BEEN HOLDING STEADY ALONG THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS WILL BE 
RELUCTANT TO EASE...AT LEAST THROUGH EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS SHOULD 
KEEP THE WINDS UP A LITTLE LONGER ACROSS THE WATERS ADJACENT TO 
THOSE KEYS. BUT OVERALL...EXPECT SOUTHEAST WINDS TO SETTLE IN TO A 
SOUTHEAST FLOW BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS EVERYWHERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON 
AND LASTING THROUGH TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. A MINOR RESURGENCE IN THE 
MID LEVEL RIDGE TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES 
LOW...AND HAVE DECIDED TO DROP OUR POP GRIDS BACK INTO THE SLIGHT 
CHANCE RANGE FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. LITTLE RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY FOR THE GFS AS FAR AS INTENSITY AND TRACK OF THE STORM 
PULLING OUT OF THE GULF COAST SUNDAY NIGHT AND OFF TO THE NORTHEAST 
BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. BUT THERE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT REASON TO 
DEVIATE FAR FROM OUR LATEST FORECAST AS FAR AS RAIN AND THUNDERSTORM 
CHANCES FOR CHRISTMAS THROUGH EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. ALSO...HAVE 
DROPPED OUR RAIN CHANCES FOR WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE 
DEEPER DRIER AIR PUSHES SOUTH OF THE STRAITS. BUT THERE IS STILL 
INDICATION OF A RATHER RAPID TURN OF THE WINDS BACK TO THE EAST FOR 
THURSDAY...SO WILL KEEP A SMALL MENTION OF SHOWERS FOR THE LAST FEW 
PERIODS OF THE FORECAST. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGE 
THIS WEEKEND...AND THEN WILL BE ABOUT 5 DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE FOR 
THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. TEMPERATURES WILL AGAIN MODERATE THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY.

&&

.MARINE...
EXPECT THE THUNDERSTORM THREAT TO REMAIN CONFINED TO THE WATERS WEST 
AND NORTHWEST OF THE ISLANDS THIS MORNING. THE WEAK SURFACE TROUGH 
THERE WILL BECOME LESS DISTINGUISHABLE THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. 
ALTHOUGH THE INITIAL WIND GUSTS WILL CONTINUE NEAR 20 KNOTS OVER THE 
EASTERN WATERS...WILL NOT HAVE ANY ADVISORY OR CAUTIONARY HEADLINES 
ON THIS UPCOMING MARINE FORECAST. EXPECT GENTLE TO MODERATE BREEZES 
FROM THIS EVENING THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND.

&&

.AVIATION...
THE MAIN IMPACTS TO MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE WILL BE PATCHES  
OF MVFR CEILINGS BETWEEN MAINLY 1500 AND 3000 FT. THESE CEILINGS ARE 
BEING PRODUCED BY VERY MOIST LOW LEVEL FLOW AND A WEAK BUT LOW 
TEMPERATURE INVERSION. THESE LOWER CEILINGS SHOULD MIX OUT TODAY 
WITH SOME HEATING. A FEW MVFR SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE ROUTE. 
KEYS TERMINALS MAY BE BRIEFLY IMPACTED BY BOTH SHOWERS AND THESE 
LOWER CEILINGS THIS MORNING. SURFACE WINDS WILL BE MAINLY 
SOUTHEASTERLY AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS.

PLENTY OF CUMULUS OF VARYING HEIGHTS OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
LOWER KEYS. IT WAS EARLIER THOUGHT AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WEAKENED 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING THE DRY AIR OVER THE WESTERN STRAITS 
WOULD ADVECT OVER THE KEYS AND COASTAL WATERS. SO FAR THE DRIER AIR 
AND CLEAR SKIES HAS REMAINED OVER THE WESTERN STRAITS...AND HAS NOT 
PROGRESSED MUCH NORTHEASTWARD. ISOLATED SHOWER COVERAGE HAS SLOWLY 
INCREASED THROUGH THE DAY...WITH SHOWERS GENERALLY MOVING TO THE 
NORTHWEST AT AROUND 17 KNOTS. THE GENERAL FLOW HAS BEEN FROM THE 
SOUTHEAST AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE ATLANTIC HIGH...AND HAS SHOWN 
NO SIGNS OF WEAKENING TODAY. CMAN STATIONS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY...WITH WINDS BETWEEN 15 AND 20 KNOTS AND GUSTS UP 
TO 25. AIR MASS OVERHEAD IS WARM AND HUMID...WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 
LOWER 70S...PRECIPITABLE WATER NEAR TWO INCHES...AND HIGH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S. THIS IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE MUCH AT ALL 
UNTIL POSSIBLE FROPA ON CHRISTMAS NIGHT.

.FORECAST...
NOW THROUGH MONDAY MORNING...THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL WEAKEN SOMEWHAT 
OVER THE WEEKEND...SURFACE FLOW WILL REMAIN EAST TO SOUTHEAST WITH 
WINDS DECREASING TO AROUND 10 KNOTS. AIRMASS WILL REMAIN THE 
SAME...WITH HIGHS IN THE LOW 80S AND DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW 
70S...DEFINITELY ABOVE CLIMATOLOGICAL NORMS.

CHRISTMAS DAY AND EVENING...THE MORNING GFS RUN CONTINUES TO SHOW 
A LOW DEVELOPING IN THE NORTHWESTERN GULF ON SUNDAY...AND THEN 
TRACKING ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF AND ACROSS THE WESTERN FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE. THIS WILL AID THE PROGRESSION OF THE ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT. AS THE LOW PUSHES NORTHEASTWARD AND INTENSIFIES...THE 
TRAILING FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GULF ON CHRISTMAS DAY...WITH 
FRONTAL PASSAGE OCCURRING IN THE KEYS MONDAY NIGHT TO EARLY TUESDAY 
MORNING. THE PRECIPITATION FIELD IN THE LATEST RUN IS SOMEWHAT MORE 
ANAFRONTAL THAN THE PREVIOUS RUN...SO COMFORTABLE WITH ONLY CHANCE 
POPS FOR MONDAY MORNING. THE MAVMOS AND METMOS DO NOT EXTEND TO 
FROPA...BUT MEXMOS HAS 12HR POP OF 65 FOR KEY WEST MONDAY NIGHT. 
WILL HOLD AT 50 PERCENT FOR AFTERNOON PACKAGE FOR BOTH MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY MORNING.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...THE PLEASANT WEATHER FOLLOWING THE 
FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL BE SHORT LIVED...AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
OVER THE SOUTHEAST IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT AND MOVES OFF INTO THE 
ATLANTIC. THIS WILL VEER OUR WINDS BACK EASTERLY BY THURSDAY 
MORNING...AND A RETURN TO DEWPOINTS NEAR 70 THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 
THE FORECAST.

.MARINE...
DIFFICULT FORECAST FOR THE EVENING COASTAL WATERS. WINDS AT MARINE 
STATIONS HAVE CONTINUED IN THE 15 TO 20 KNOT RANGE...WITH GUSTS

SCA CRITERIA. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE WINDS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENTLY BELOW 
20 KNOTS WILL DROP SCA FOR EVENING FORECAST AND CARRY SCEC ALL 
WATERS.

POSSIBLY AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH TONIGHT. TOPS WILL 
BE 10-15KFT OVER WATER...BUT A FEW HIGHER TOPPED THUNDERSTORMS MAY

DOWNPOURS AND EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS....STRETCHES FROM THE WATERS 
WEST/NORTHWEST OF THE LOWER KEYS DOWN TO A TAPERED EXTENSION ALL THE 
WAY TO THE NORTH CUBAN COAST. OTHERWISE...THE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE

STRETCHED ACROSS MOST OF THE ISLANDS AT THIS HOUR.

.FORECAST...
IN THE SHORT TERM PORTION OF THE FORECAST...THROUGH

THE LAST 24 HOURS OR SO. ALSO...A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE WHICH IS 
ASSISTING THE CURRENT CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OF

ADJUSTMENT UPWARD ON THE MORNING RAIN CHANCES MAY INDEED BE 
NECESSARY. BEYOND TODAY...SHORT RANGE MODELS AGREE THAT THE DEEPER

FOR EACH PERIOD THROUGH THIS WEEKEND.

BY LATE SUNDAY THROUGH CHRISTMAS...THE GFS STILL CONSOLIDATES AN 
AREA OF STRENGTHENING LOW PRESSURE UP THROUGH THE GULF COAST 
STATES/FLORIDA PANHANDLE...AND THEN WANTS TO SPLIT THE CIRCULATION 
OVER THE SOUTHEAST COAST AND THE OHIO VALLEY. FOR THE LOCAL

IN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE FRONT...WITH THE LATEST GFS RUN CLEARING 
THE DEEP MOISTURE EVEN BEYOND THE STRAITS. HOWEVER IT DRAWS IT BACK 
RATHER QUICKLY ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS BY MID-WEEK.

A SURFACE HIGH TO THE NORTH CONTINUES TO SET UP EASTERLY WINDS 
ACROSS THE AREA.  SPEEDS ARE OVER 20KTS IN THE STRAITS AND NEAR 15KTS 
ON LAND AND OVER THE GULF.  WITH COOLER TEMPS TO THE WEST...THIS 
FLOW IS BRINGING WARM ADVECTION AND LOW LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT.  THIS 
IS COMBINING WITH WEAK DIVERGENCE ALOFT TO CAUSE WIDESPREAD SMALL 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA.  THE STRONGEST SHOWERS ARE WEST OF THE KEYS 
NEAR THE TORTUGAS...WHERE TOPS ARE ALMOST 20KFT...BUT OVER THE KEYS 
THEY ARE CLOSER TO 10KFT.  A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE IS SUPPORTING 
THESE STRONGER SHOWERS TO THE WEST.  FURTHER WEST...A LARGE AND 
POWERFUL LOW OVER KANSAS HAS PULLED THE SOUTHERN STREAM OF THE JET 
NORTHWARD...MERGING IT WITH THE NORTHERN STREAM OVER THE TN 
VALLEY...CREATING SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO.  

.FORECAST...
THE INCOMING MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL CONTINUE TO WORK WITH THE LOW 
LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT TO SPREAD SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY EVEN A 
THUNDERSTORM ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT.  THE SHOWERS WILL BE LESS 
COMMON TOMORROW FOLLOWING THE PASSAGE OF THE SHORT WAVE.  WIND 
SPEEDS ARE PROGGED TO DROP A BIT LATE TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.  
ODDLY...DESPITE MODEL SOUNDINGS THAT ARE FAVORABLE TO 
PRECIP...GUIDANCE POPS ARE VERY LOW FOR THIS TYPE OF PATTERN.  WILL 
GO WELL ABOVE GUIDANCE TONIGHT...AND THEN SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDANCE 
TOMORROW.  

SATURDAY...ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL CONTINUE...AS WILL SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT.  GUIDANCE POPS ARE STILL VERY LOW...DESPITE AMPLE MOISTURE 
AND GOOD THERMO PROFILE.  WOULD EXPECT SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS UNDER 
THIS SCENARIO...MUCH MORE THAN MOS SEEMS TO INDICATE.  

SUNDAY...A SECOND MID LATITUDE UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL DROP ALL THE WAY 
SOUTHWARD TO THE NORTHERN GULF COAST AS THE ONE CURRENTLY OVER KS 
LIFTS OUT TO THE GREAT LAKES.  THIS LOW WILL CREATE A SURFACE LOW ON 
THE NORTHERN GULF COAST IN THE VICINITY OF THE PANHANDLE.  THERE IS 
SURPRISINGLY GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN MODELS AND EVEN BETWEEN THE GFS 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS.  THIS WILL CONTINUE TO BRING LOW LEVEL ISENTROPIC 
LIFT IN SOUTHEAST FLOW...AND WEAK UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE IN 
SOUTHWEST FLOW.  WILL CONTINUE TO GO ABOVE GUIDANCE FOR POPS.

CHRISTMAS DAY...STILL GOOD AGREEMENT IN MODELS...ESPECIALLY AMONG 
THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS...THAT A FRONT WILL PASS THE KEYS FOR 
CHRISTMAS.  GFS POPS FINALLY RISE TO EXPECTED LEVELS.  

EXTENDED...DRY AND COOL AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE FRONT FOR 
TUE-FRI...BUT THE MOISTURE MAY NOT MOVE BEYOND THE 
STRAITS...MEAINING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE LEFT IN THE 
FORECAST.   


&&   

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
TONIGHT...WITH WINDS AND SEAS LIKELY TO SUBSIDE TOMORROW MORNING.

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE WITH A FRONT PASSAGE ON 
MONDAY.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
453 AM EST WED DEC 20 2006

.DISCUSSION...
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING REVEALED A 
SHORT WAVE RIDGE OVER MOST OF THE GULF BASIN AND FLORIDA PENINSULA. 
ANTICYCLONIC TRAJECTORIES ALOFT HAVE MAINTAINED SUBSIDENCE AND 
DRYING THROUGH MUCH OF THE MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE. HOWEVER...THE LOWER 
TROPOSPHERE OVER THE KEYS REMAINS MODERATELY MOIST AND WEAKLY 
UNSTABLE...AS SHOWN BY THE KEY WEST TUESDAY EVENING SOUNDING. KEY 
WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS HAVE SHOWN ISOLATED SHOWERS MOVING TOWARD 
THE WEST-SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA ALL NIGHT. CURRENT AIR 
TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ISLANDS ARE HOLDING IN THE LOWER 70S...WHILE 
DEWPOINTS ARE STEADY IN THE MIDDLE 60S. A SURFACE ANTICYCLONE WAS 
CENTERED OVER EASTERN VIRGINIA EARLY THIS MORNING...AND WAS HELPING 
TO MAINTAIN A LARGE AREA OF NORTHEAST TO EAST BREEZES ACROSS THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA AND ADJACENT COASTAL WATERS...AS WELL AS MUCH OF 
THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...STRAITS OF FLORIDA...AND NORTHWEST 
CARIBBEAN SEA.

FRESH BREEZES ARE EXPECTED TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS A MODERATELY 
STRONG HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD MAINTAINS A 
FAIRLY STRONG MSL PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
SURROUNDING WATERS. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD REMAIN SLIGHT THROUGH THIS 
PERIOD WITH A FEW FAST-MOVING SHOWERS MOVING SWIFTLY TOWARD THE 
SOUTHWEST OR WEST...CLIPPING PORTIONS OF THE KEYS.

12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES HAVE BEEN EDGED UP SLIGHTLY FOR THURSDAY NIGHT 
AND FRIDAY OWING TO THE INCREASING LIKELIHOOD OF A BOUNDARY LAYER 
SHEAR ZONE AND ASSOCIATED ZONE OF CONVERGENCE MOVING NORTHWESTWARD 
THROUGH THE KEYS ALONG THE SOUTHWESTERN FLANK OF THE EASTWARD-MOVING 
ANTICYCLONE CURRENTLY CENTERED OVER VIRGINIA. THIS CONVERGENCE ZONE 
IS DISCERNIBLE IN GOES-12 INFRARED IMAGES OVER PORTIONS OF THE 
BAHAMAS AND GREATER ANTILLES...AND REPRESENTS THE REMAINS OF AN OLD 
COLD FRONT. BOTH THE NCEP GFS AND NAM HAVE ANALYZED THIS FEATURE IN 
SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE RUNS...AND THEIR ASSOCIATED MOS HAVE BEEN SLOWLY 
INCREASING POPS FOR THE THURSDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME ESPECIALLY.

THE WEEKEND SHOULD BRING SOUTHEAST BREEZES...MILD TEMPERATURES WITH 
INCREASING CLOUDS AND HUMIDITY...AND A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS. FORECAST 
UNCERTAINTY GOES UP WITH FORECAST CONFIDENCE GOING DOWN BY SUNDAY 
NIGHT...AS A COMPLEX UPPER-AIR PATTERN SETS UP OVER THE SOUTHERN 
UNITED STATES...WITH AN ASSOCIATED SURFACE CYCLONE OF UNKNOWN 
INTENSITY PROBABLY DEVELOPING SOMEWHERE BETWEEN THE CENTRAL GULF OF 
MEXICO AND NEW JERSEY BY MONDAY MORNING. IT IS TOO EARLY TOO TELL 
EXACTLY WHERE AND HOW STRONG. HOWEVER...ALL MEDIUM-RANGE MODELS SHOW 
A SURFACE CYCLONE EVENTUALLY MOVING OUT ACROSS THE WESTERN NORTH 
ATLANTIC BY TUESDAY...WITH THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT/WIND SHIFT 
CLEARING THE KEYS BY TUESDAY AS WELL. THE CHANCE AND TYPE RAIN IS 
STILL UP IN THE AIR...SO TO SPEAK...BUT IT SEEMS THAT CHRISTMAS DAY 
WILL BE THE MOST LIKELY TIME FRAME FOR WHATEVER HAPPENS. 
THEREFORE...WE HAVE INCREASED RAIN CHANCES BY 10 PERCENT FOR 
CHRISTMAS DAY AND NIGHT. CHECK FORECASTS REGULARLY FOR UPDATES.
&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR ALL MARINE ZONES...AND WILL 
LIKELY CONTINUE IN EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY. BREEZES SHOULD SLACKEN 
LATE THURSDAY AS A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES EAST OVER THE ATLANTIC 
AND WEAKENS. FORECAST UNCERTAINTY THEN INCREASES CONSIDERABLY OVER 
THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL PRODUCE 
BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1015 PM EST TUE DEC 19 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE HAS SHIFTED SOUTHWARD FROM 24 HOURS 
AGO...AND NOW EXTENDS WEST FROM THE ATLANTIC AND INLAND ALONG THE 
NORTH BORDER OF FLORIDA. HIGHEST PRESSURES OVER LAND ARE NEAR 1026 
MB. AS A RESULT OF THESE INCREASED PRESSURES OVER NORTH FLORIDA AND 
ADJACENT ATLANTIC...KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE INCREASED THIS EVENING AS 
EXPECTED. A SATELLITE QUIKSCAT PASS OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS AT 702 PM 
EST MEASURED SURFACE WINDS FROM THE NE 19-23 KT OVER FLORIDA STRAITS 
WATERS OFF THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS...15-19 KT AT THAT TIME OVER 
WATERS OFF THE LOWER KEYS TO DRY TORTUGAS...AND A BIT LESS OVER GULF 
WATERS NW AND N OF THE LOWER KEYS. 

A WEAK COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED SOUTH OVER THE NORTH CAROLINA COASTAL 
WATERS...AND NORTH OF THIS BOUNDARY A NEW AND STRONGER HIGH PRESSURE 
AREA IS BUILDING AND SPREADING OVER THE NORTHEAST STATES AND OHIO 
VALLEY AREA. 

THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING SHOWED THAT SOME DOWNWARD MIXING OF 
DRY AIR ALOFT HAD TAKEN PLACE DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. MOST MOISTURE 
WAS RELEGATED TO LEVELS BELOW 7 THSD FT...WITH A MEASURED 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE OF 1.24 INCH. AS WAS THE CASE LAST NIGHT...
LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE IS SUPPORTING ISOLATED LOW-TOPPED SHOWERS OVER 
THE KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS. AREA TEMPERATURES REMAIN NICE...IN THE 
LOWER TO MID 70S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S. 

.FORECAST...
THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECASTS WILL BE UPDATED JUST TO DELETE WIND 
TRANSITION. WIND SPEEDS HAVE PICKED UP AS ADVERTISED. A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE NIGHT REMAINS REASONABLE AS FORECAST. 
&&

.MARINE...
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE HAS SLIPPED SOUTH TO THE NORTHERN EDGE OF 
FLORIDA...THEREBY INCREASING WINDS OVER KEYS WATERS AS EXPECTED. 
LATEST OBSERVATIONS FROM ALONG THE REEF SHOW ENE WINDS RIGHT AT 20 
KT WITH GUSTS 25-28 KT. AN EXCEPTION IS THE WIND OVER WESTERN KEYS 
AREAS...WHERE SAND KEY AND PULASKI SHOAL WINDS WERE STILL RUNNING 
13-18 KT BUT WERE INCREASING AND EXPECTED TO COME UP TO AROUND 20 KT 
ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE AS WELL. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IS UP FOR ALL 
KEYS ATLANTIC-SIDE WATERS. NE-E WINDS IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE SHOULD 
SET IN FOR FLORIDA BAY AND KEYS GULF WATERS. 

A NEW HIGH PRESSURE AREA HAS ALREADY STARTED TO BUILD AND SPREAD 
INTO THE EASTERN STATES...AND THIS IN TURN SHOULD PUMP UP WIND 
SPEEDS EVEN MORE ON KEYS WATERS WEDNESDAY AND CONTINUING ON INTO 
LATE THIS WEEK. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...INCLUDING THE KMTH AND KEYW TERMINALS THROUGH 12Z. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE. 
SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYS TERMINALS WILL AVERAGE 050/10-15KTS. &&

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
330 PM EST TUE DEC 19 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500 TO 200 MB)...AS OF 
200 PM...A PRONOUNCED SPLIT FLOW PATTERN CONTINUES OVER THE 
CONUS...WITH A NEARLY CLOSED LOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED 
STATES. A 50 TO 75 KNOT SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE JET ROUNDS THE BOTTOM 
OF THE CLOSED LOW AT CENTRAL MEXICO...AND WEAKENS AS IT ENTERS A 
SHORTWAVE RIDGE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE ON THE 
WESTERN SIDE OF THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE RIDGE.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...AS OF 200 PM...A 
NEAR 1036 MB CENTER OF AN EXPANSIVE SYNOPTIC SCALE HIGH PRESSURE 
SYSTEM REMAINS OVER NORTHERN MISSOURI. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...A 
1025 MB WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM 30N 60W 
WESTWARD TO ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA. 

.CURRENT...AS OF 200 PM...TEMPERATURES HAVE REACHED NEAR 80 DEGREES 
AT KEY WEST AND MARATHON SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON...WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
THE UPPER 60S. SKIES ARE MOSTLY SUNNY OVER THE ISLANDS...WITH MOSTLY 
JUST SOME SCATTERED CUMULUS. KEY WEST RADAR HAS BEEN MOSTLY DEVOID 
OF ECHOES SO FAR TODAY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A SOLE CLUSTER OF 
SHOWERS IN THE FAR SOUTHWESTERN STRAITS...NEAR THE INTERNATIONAL 
WATERS. WINDS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF ARE MOSTLY NORTHEAST BETWEEN 14 
AND 16 KNOTS WITH GUSTS NEAR 20 KNOTS. 

.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500-200 MB). TONIGHT THROUGH 
SATURDAY...SPLIT FLOW PATTERN TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE CONUS. UPPER 
LOW OVER SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES WILL DART NORTHEAST TO KANSAS BY 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...AND THE UPPER GREAT LAKES BY SATURDAY. STRONG 
ANTICYCLONIC MOTION IN ASSOCIATION WITH A BUILDING UPPER HIGH OVER 
THE GULF OF MEX WILL KEEP WARMING AND DRYING ALOFT OF THE KEYS UNTIL 
THURSDAY NIGHT. FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT THE UPPER FLOW OVER THE KEYS 
WILL BECOME SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST...TRANSPORTING ADDITIONAL MOISTURE 
ABOVE THE KEYS THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...AS THE AFOREMENTIONED CLOSED LOW SWINGS 
UP INTO CANADA...AND ANOTHER NEARLY CLOSED UPPER LOW IS FORECAST TO 
DEEPEN OVER WEST TEXAS. THIS WILL HOLD THE KEYS BENEATH A MOIST AND 
DEEP SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. 

IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE LEVELS...SHORT TERM(TONIGHT THRU THURSDAY). 
12 MODEL RUNS CONSISTENT WITH INDICATIONS THAT THE 1035 MB HIGH 
CENTER OVER THE PLAINS WILL REDEVELOP/MORPH INTO A STRONGER 1030 
PLUS MB RIDGE OVER THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES BY TOMORROW MORNING. THIS 
RIDGE WILL HOLD NEAR 1030 MB NORTH OF THE KEYS THROUGH THURSDAY. AS 
A RESULT...WILL SEE FAIR AND BREEZY CONDITIONS WITH SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES...AND ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS. HAVE MADE 
ESSENTIALLY NO CHANGES TO ONGOING FORECAST.

THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...A CLOSED LOW OVER KANSAS 
THURSDAY WILL SLIDE NORTHEASTWARD TO NEAR THE LAKES BY FRIDAY NIGHT. 
THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT SOUTHEAST...WHILE 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION RAISED NORTHWARD INTO THE FRONTAL ZONE 
AS THE GULF OPENS UP FOR BUSINESS. THE STRONGEST HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BE SITUATED WELL TO THE NORTH OF FLORIDA...OFF THE NEW ENGLAND 
COAST. AS A RESULT...WILL SEE VEERING WINDS AND GRADUAL MOISTENING 
IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER OVER THE KEYS. PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER) VALUES 
ARE NOW FORECAST TO REMAIN BETWEEN 1.75 AND 2.00 INCHES FOR THIS 
PERIOD...HOWEVER...DO NOT SEE ANY OTHER FORCING IN PLAY AT THE 
TIME...SO WILL HOLD WITH INHERITED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. TEMPERATURE 
MAXIMA AND MINIMA WILL BE REMAIN A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...INCLUDING CHRISTMAS EVE AND CHRISTMAS 
DAY. LAST SEVERAL MODEL RUNS HAVE HAD A HISTORY OF DIFFICULTY WITH 
DEVELOPMENT OF WEAK SURFACE LOW PRESSURE/WAVES AREAS NEAR THE 
FRONTAL ZONE MOVING THROUGH THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. HOWEVER...ALL 
THE MODELS INSIST ON A SURFACE OR LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE BOUNDARY 
REMAINING BEHIND THE LOW PRESSURE NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS ON 
CHRISTMAS EVE AND CHRISTMAS DAY. BASED ON THE LAST RAIN EVENT...THIS 
MAY YIELD ENHANCED ISENTROPIC LIFT AND SURFACE CONVERGENCE. WE ARE 
CARRYING LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THIS PERIOD. LIKE LAST WEEKENDS...WOULD 
THINK IN THIS CASE THAT ANY MID-LEVEL ENERGY WILL PROBABLY NOT BE 
EASILY DETECTABLE IN THE MODELS MAY BE IN PLACE TO FURTHER AID IN 
LARGE SCALE LIFT. WE DO NOT HAVE ISOLATED THUNDER IN THE FORECAST AS 
OF YET...BUT BELIEVE THAT WILL BE A POSSIBILITY EVENTHOUGH MAIN 
UPPER DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH CLOSED LOW WILL BE MUCH FARTHER 
NORTH. WILL MAINTAIN LOW CHANCE POPS ATTM...AND THIS IS STILL BELOW 
NUMERICAL GUIDANCE FOR CHRISTMAS DAY AND ON TUESDAY. 
&&

.MARINE...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...MARINERS WILL ENCOUNTER SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS ON THE ATLANTIC WATERS FOR TONIGHT AND 
CONTINUING THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY. SMALL CRAFT CONDITIONS APPEAR 
LIKELY ON FLORIDA BAY AND THE GULF WATERS FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY MORNING. ON THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...LOOKS TO 
BE A SLIGHTLY IMPROVED PERIOD FOR BOATING...BUT THERE COULD STILL BE 
SOME LEFTOVER LONG PERIOD SWELLS FROM WELL DEVELOPED SEAS IN THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS. 

FOR SATURDAY THROUGH CHRISTMAS DAY...MARINERS COULD ENCOUNTER 
LOCALLY HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. HAVE NOT ADDED THUNDER 
TO THE FORECAST YET BECAUSE ANY THREAT WOULD MOST LIKELY REMAIN VERY 
ISOLATED.

&&

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW 
TWEB ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL 
PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE. EXPECT 
NORTHEAST WINDS BETWEEN 10 TO 15 KNOTS AT THE KMTH AND KEYW

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 900 AM...SKIES ARE PARTLY SUNNY OVER THE KEYS AND 
ADJOINING WATERS. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ISLANDS HAVE REACHED THE 
MIDDLE 70S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S. KEY WEST RADAR DEPICTS A 
NARROW STRING OF MODERATE ISOLATED SHOWERS EXTENDING FROM JUST OFF 
THE REEF NEAR LITTLE PALM ISLAND RESORT SOUTHWEST TO THE OUTER

.DISCUSSION...
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING REVEALED A 
BROAD SHORT WAVE RIDGE COVERING MOST OF THE GULF BASIN AND FLORIDA 
PENINSULA. ANTICYCLONIC TRAJECTORIES ALOFT HAVE CONTRIBUTED TO 
SUBSIDENCE AND DRYING THROUGH MUCH OF THE MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE. 
MEANWHILE...IT REMAINS FAIRLY MOIST AND AT LEAST WEAKLY UNSTABLE IN 
THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE AS EVIDENCED BY THE KEY WEST SUNDAY EVENING 
SOUNDING. IN FACT...KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS HAVE SHOWN ISOLATED 
SHOWERS...SOME WITH TOPS AS HIGH AS 20000FT AGL...MOVING WEST ACROSS 
THE SERVICE AREA ALL NIGHT. CURRENT AIR TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE 
ISLANDS ARE HOLDING IN THE LOWER 70S...WHILE DEWPOINTS ARE STEADY IN 
THE UPPER 60S. A VERY LARGE AREA OF GENERALLY EASTERLY SURFACE WINDS 
COVERS THE ENTIRE GULF OF MEXICO...STRAITS OF FLORIDA...BAHAMAS... 
AND CARIBBEAN...SOUTH OF AN ILL-DEFINED RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE. A 
1034MB HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS CENTERED OVER NORTHWEST MISSOURI AT 
09Z...AND IS MOVING EASTWARD. THIS WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF 
FRESHENING LOCAL BREEZES DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 

THE WEATHER PATTERN...AND FORECAST...OVER THE NEXT WEEK MIGHT BE 
CHARACTERIZED BY THE DESCRIPTION OF THREE DIFFERENT REGIMES. THE 
FIRST REGIME WILL COMPRISE THE PERIOD FROM TODAY THROUGH ABOUT 
THURSDAY...AND WILL CONSIST OF RIDGING AND SUBSIDENCE ALOFT...A 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKY WITH ISOLATED PASSING SHOWERS...MILD TEMPERATURES 
MOSTLY IN THE 70S DAY AND NIGHT...AND FRESH BREEZES OUT OF THE 
NORTHEAST AND EAST. THE SECOND REGIME WILL COMPRISE THE PERIOD FROM 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH ABOUT SATURDAY NIGHT...AND WILL CONSIST OF 
INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLIES ALOFT WITH NEUTRAL VERTICAL MOTIONS... 
SLOWLY INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES...SLIGHTLY WARMER AND 
MORE HUMID CONDITIONS...AND MODERATE BREEZES OUT OF THE SOUTHEAST. 
THE THIRD REGIME WILL COMPRISE THE PERIOD OF CHRISTMAS EVE AND 
CHRISTMAS DAY. HERE FORECAST UNCERTAINTY IS GREATEST. WIND AND 
WEATHER WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER-AIR 
PATTERN OVER THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES AND THE ASSOCIATED GULF 
COAST STORM SYSTEM. IT APPEARS THAT A FRONT WITH ASSOCIATED 
RAIN/SQUALLS/WIND SHIFTS MAY MOVE THROUGH THE SERVICE AREA ON 
CHRISTMAS DAY...BUT UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH AND FORECAST CONFIDENCE LOW 
THIS FAR OUT. CHECK FORECASTS AND DISCUSSIONS REGULARLY AS THE 
PATTERN BECOMES MORE DISCERNIBLE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL FORECAST 
CYCLES.
&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED BEGINNING TONIGHT AT 
LEAST FOR ATLANTIC ZONES AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED

THAT PERIOD.

LOW LEVEL MASS AND MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IS FORECAST TO BRING LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE AND A CHANCE OF ISOLATED SHOWERS THURSDAY AND
CONTINUING THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS ARE NOT
FORECAST TO BE CONDUCIVE TO SUPPORT CONVECTION DURING THIS TIME
FRAME...SO ONLY ISOLATED SHOWER ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
RAPID CLEARING TOOK PLACE PRIOR TO SUNSET WITH THIN DECK NEAR 15000 
FEET CONTINUING OVER THE LOWER KEYS. SOME STRATOCUMULUS IS ALSO 
BEING CARRIED WESTWARD ACROSS THE UPPER KEYS AND STRAITS. KBYX RADAR 
INDICATES ISOLATED SHOWERS ACROSS THE OUTER STRAITS MAINLY SOUTH AND 
SOUTHWEST OF KEY WEST. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 70S WITH ONLY A 
FEW DEGREES OF ADDITIONAL COOLING EXPECTED. EAST TO NORTHEAST WINDS 
ARE NEAR 10 MPH ON THE ISLANDS...BUT AROUND 15 KNOTS WITH OCCASIONAL 
GUSTS OVER 20 KNOTS ALONG THE REEF.

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
HIGHLY POSITIVE...ALMOST EAST-WEST ORIENTED MID/UPPER SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH...CONTINUES TO DEPART FLORIDA TO THE EAST. WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY INDICATES DRY AIR SWEEPING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHEAST 
GULF INTO THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...ALTHOUGH EVENING SOUNDINGS SHOULD 
MOST OF THE DRYING ABOVE 700 MB AT RUSKIN...AND ABOVE 600 MB AT KEY 
WEST. A WEAK INVERSION NEAR 15000 FEET MAY TRAP SOME ALTOCUMULUS 
FROM TIME TO TIME. EXPECT THE DEEP EAST FLOW TO PICK UP IN SPEED 
OVERNIGHT AS LOW LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING BUILDS GRADUALLY ACROSS 
THE SOUTHEAST U.S. AND WESTERN ATLANTIC. PUBLIC ZONES WERE UPDATED 
TO REFLECT THE PARTIAL CLEARING IN THE SKIES AND INCREASE IN WINDS. 
REDUCED POPS SLIGHTLY TO 10 PERCENT AS ISENTROPIC DESCENT HAS TAKEN 
HOLD OVER THE SERVICE AREA BELOW 500 MB. 

&&

.MARINE...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WITH 1024 MB HIGH ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST 
STATES WILL TIGHTEN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TO AROUND 5 MB FROM 
JACKSONVILLE TO KEY WEST. EAST TO NORTHEAST WINDS WILL INCREASE TO 
15 TO 20 KNOTS ACROSS THE STRAITS.. WINDS WILL INCREASE TO NEAR 15 
KNOTS WITH HIGHER GUSTS ACROSS THE BAY AND GULF SIDE WATERS. BOATERS 
SHOULD USE CAUTION IF HEADING OUT INTO THE STRAITS THROUGH 
TUESDAY...WITH SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES LIKELY TO BE REQUIRED OVER THE 
STRAITS BY WEDNESDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS WILL 
AFFECT THE ROUTE...AND POSSIBLY A VERY FEW SMALL SHOWERS. SURFACE 
WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE NORTHEAST TO EAST GENERALLY AT 8-11 
KT.

.CLIMATE...
THE 1.07 INCHES OF RAIN THAT FELL AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT 
TODAY BROKE THE RAINFALL RECORD FOR THIS DATE...WHICH WAS PREVIOUSLY 
0.59 INCHES SET ON DECEMBER 17 1893. IN THE PAST THREE 
DAYS...DECEMBER 15-17...3.07 INCHES OF RAIN HAS BEEN RECORDED AT THE 
AIRPORT. THIS IS THE HIGHEST THREE-DAY RAINFALL TOTAL IN KEY WEST 
SINCE OCTOBER 30-NOVEMBER 2 2005...WHEN 4.20 INCHES FELL. THE NORMAL 
RAINFALL TOTAL FOR THE ENTIRE MONTH OF DECEMBER IS 2.14 INCHES.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
300 PM EST SUN DEC 17 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500 TO 200 MB)...AS OF 
200 PM...A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW PATTERN IS PRESENT ACROSS MOST OF THE 
CONUS. A 100-150 KNOT PACIFIC JET AT 250 MB TRAVERSES THE COUNTRY 
FROM SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA TO ACROSS THE PLAINS...AND EXITS OVER THE 
NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. A LARGE AREA OF MUCH MORE 
STABLE...DRY...AND WARMER UPPER LEVEL AIR IS APPROACHING THE FLORIDA 
KEYS ATTM.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...ON THE SYNOPTIC 
SCALE...1027 MB HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC TO THE NORTH GEORGIA MOUNTAINS. ON THE REGIONAL 
SCALE...THE LOWER FLORIDA KEYS STILL REMAIN WITHIN A VERY MOIST 
LOWER AND MID LEVEL AIRMASS. THE LATEST AVAILABLE VWP SCAN 
ILLUSTRATES MODERATE...MOIST SOUTHEAST FLOW FROM THE SURFACE 8000 
FEET...WITH MID LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT REMAINING ABOVE THAT. THIS 
INCREASED MID-LEVEL LIFT NEAR THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS...COMBINED 
WITH A MOIST SOUTHEAST FLOW IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER...HAS ALLOWED FOR 
GREATER THAN NORMAL SURFACE CONVERGENCE...PERPETUATING ANOTHER LARGE 
AREA OF RAINFALL WITH EMBEDDED HEAVIER SHOWERS. THIS IS WHAT 
PROMPTED AN EARLIER AMENDMENT.

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...DESPITE ANOTHER VERY WET DAY WITH 
MULTIPLE CLOUD DECKS PERSISTING ACROSS MUCH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 
KEYS SO FAR TODAY...TEMPERATURES HAVE MANAGED TO REACH INTO THE 
LOWER AND MIDDLE 70S WITH DEWPOINTS NEAR 70 DEGREES. MARATHON 
AIRPORT HAS RECORDED ALMOST 2 INCHES OF RAINFALL SINCE SUNRISE. 
LATEST RADAR SCANS FROM KEY WEST RADAR INDICATES THAT SCATTERED 
SHOWERS CONTINUE TO IMPACT LOCATIONS FROM THE SEVEN MILE BRIDGE TO 
KEY WEST. ACROSS THE UPPER KEYS...IT HAS BEEN A FINE DAY...WITH A 
MIXTURE OF SUNSHINE AND CLOUDINESS...AND TEMPERATURES HAVE REACHED 
THE UPPER 70S. WINDS ALONG THE REEF ARE BETWEEN EAST AND NORTHEAST 
BETWEEN 12 AND 18 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 15 AND 25 
KNOTS...EXCEPT HIGHER IN HEAVIER SHOWERS.

.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB). TONIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH NOW OVER THE BAHAMAS WILL 
CONTINUE TO SLIDE EASTWARD AWAY FROM THE KEYS TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW...AS A 588-590 DM 500 MB ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SOUTHWEST 
GULF OF MEXICO WILL BEGIN TO SLIDE BUILD EASTWARD. AS A RESULT WILL 
SEE ASSOCIATED HEIGHT RISES WITH INCREASING SUBSIDENCE AND DRYING 
ALOFT OVER THE KEYS.

THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...AN UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN UNITED 
STATES WILL DEVELOP WITHIN THE PROGRESSIVE SPLIT FLOW PATTERN THAT 
WILL CONTINUE OVER THE CONUS. AS THIS UPPER LOW MOVES EASTWARD...IT 
WILL PULL IN HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE IN FROM THE GULF BY 
FRIDAY...PULLING LOTS OF MOISTURE OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS FRIDAY 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

IN THE LOWER AND MID-LEVELS...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE 
1027 MB RIDGE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND 
SOUTHEASTERN STATES. MODELS SHOW A RELATIVELY COOL COLD 
FRONT...AHEAD OF A 1030-1035 MB HIGH CURRENTLY NOW OVER THE UPPER 
MIDWEST...PUSHING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND THE NORTHEAST BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS COLD FRONT WILL WASH OUT IN THE MID-ATLANTIC 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY...AS 1030-1035 MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTER BUILDS OVER 
THE MIDATLANTIC STATES AND MAINTAINS THAT MAGNITUDE THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THIS WILL MARK THE NEXT WIND SURGE BEGINNING ON 
TUESDAY AND CONTINUING THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE WEEK. WILL HOLD 
WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS THIS 
EVENING...WITH DECREASING CLOUDINESS AFTER SUNSET. SURFACE WINDS 
WILL BACK TO NORTHEAST AS THE SURFACE CONVERGENCE BOUNDARIES SLOWLY 
DISSOLVE AFTER SUNSET. EXPECT TEMPERATURES TOMORROW THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO REMAIN NEAR OR A FEW DEGREES ABOVE CLIMATOLOGICAL 
MAXIMA AND MINIMA FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. WILL MAINTAIN HIGH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S AND LOW IS THE UPPER 60S FOR THE KEYS. 
EXPECT ONLY VERY SLIGHT RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK.

THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...THE 1030 MB PLUS HIGH WILL MOVE INTO THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC AND MAINTAIN A TIGHT GRADIENT ACROSS THE WATERS ON 
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD RISE A FEW DEGREES AND 
BECOME SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. LOW PRESSURE OVER 
THE PLAINS WILL DART NORTHEAST INTO CANADA BY SATURDAY MORNING. THE 
ACTUAL ATTENDANT COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE SOUTHEAST TO NORTH 
FLORIDA/GEORGIA BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. THE MAIN IMPACT WILL BE AN 
INCREASE IN THE LOWER AND MID-LEVEL MOISTURE AGAIN FOR FRIDAY 
THROUGH SUNDAY. WILL RAISE POPS ABOVE CLIMO 10% FOR THIS TIMEFRAME. 

&&

.MARINE...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE BUILDS TO THE NORTH OF THE KEYS AND THE DEPARTING TROUGH MOVES 
FURTHER AWAY...SURFACE WINDS SHOULD ONCE AGAIN INCREASE ON ALL 
WATERS. THE LATEST GUIDANCE FOR THE C-MANS ARE NOT VERY SOLID ON 
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BUT IS MORE 
PROBABLE FOR THE PERIOD TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...AS THE 
AFOREMENTIONED STRONGER ANTICYCLONE STRENGTHENS OVER THE 
MID-ATLANTIC WATERS. HAVE ISSUED A SCEC FOR THE ATLANTIC WATERS FOR 
TONIGHT...WITH SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS NOW PROBABLE FOR 
TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.

&&

.AVIATION...BESIDES BRIEF MVFR CIGS AND VSBYS IN THE VICINITY OF KEY 
WEST AND THE LOWER KEYS EARLY THIS EVENING...VFR CONDITIONS WILL 
PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA TO KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE. LAYERED CLOUDS THAT 
HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT FROM FL005 THROUGH FL150 OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND 
THE KEYS WILL FINALLY BEGIN DECREASING ALL AREAS LATE THIS EVENING 
AND OVERNIGHT. EXPECT MAINLY EAST WINDS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND 
TERMINALS BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS THROUGH MONDAY MORNING.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
WIDESPREAD OVERCAST SKIES COVER THE SERVICE AREA THIS EVENING WITH 
KBYX DETECTING WIDESPREAD LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN. THERE APPEARS TO 
BE A MESOSCALE FEATURE THAT EVOLVED FROM AN EAST-WEST BAND OF 
CONVECTION OVER THE OUTER STRAITS AROUND SUNSET...WHICH IS BRINGING 
MODERATE RAIN TO THE NEARSHORE ATLANTIC WATERS ALONG THE MIDDLE TO 
UPPER KEYS. STRONGER CELLS APPEAR TO BE DEVELOPING BEYOND 40 NM 
SOUTH OF MARATHON. OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...KBYX VAD WIND PROFILE 
INDICATED THAT EAST FLOW HAS DEEPENED FROM 3000 FT TO 9000 FT...WITH 
SOUTHWESTERLIES RETREATING HIGHER AND HIGHER. WINDS HAVE BEEN NORTH 
TO NORTHEAST 5 TO 10 KNOTS...BUT HAVE BECOME EASTERLY AND PICKED UP 
TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS WITH HIGHER GUSTS. AN EXCEPTION HAS BEEN THE DRY 
TORTUGAS...WHERE SUSTAINED WINDS HAVE EXCEEDED 15 KNOTS WITH GUSTS 
20 TO 25 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE STEADY AROUND 71-72F. AVERAGE 
RAINFALL THROUGHOUT THE KEYS HAS BEEN NEAR 1 INCH.

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
THE MID/UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN GULF WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE 
EASTWARD OVERNIGHT...PROVIDING ANOTHER SHOT OF DEEP UPWARD VERTICAL 
MOTION INTO THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. AFTER THAT...MID LEVEL WINDS 
SHOULD BECOME MORE WESTERLY WITH SYNOPTIC SCALE DYNAMICS BEGINNING 
TO DEPART. FROM 700 MB AND BELOW...THE INFLUENCE OF A LOW LEVEL 
TROUGH WEST OF THE KEYS TO THE YUCATAN CHANNEL WILL KEEP ISENTROPIC 
LIFT GOING THROUGH 12Z. INSTABILITY IS PRESENT FOR A SMALL CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY OVER THE STRAITS. WILL LEAVE THEM IN THE PUBLIC 
ZONES AS WELL AS THE 100 POPS...HOWEVER WILL MAKE AN ADJUSTMENT TO 
REFLECT CURRENT STRONGER SURFACE WINDS. OVERNIGHT RAINFALL OF ONE 
HALF INCH WITH ISOLATED SPOTS PICKING UP AN ADDITIONAL INCH ARE 
EXPECTED.

&&

.MARINE...
TIGHTER PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN A 1020MB HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
U.S. AND A LOW PRESSURE TROUGH IN THE SOUTHEAST GULF WILL KEEP EAST 
WINDS HIGHER WEST OF KEY WEST...AND HAVE BOOSTED WINDS TO NEAR 15 
KNOTS WITH HIGHER GUSTS WEST OF KEY WEST. WINDS WILL BE NORTHEAST TO 
EAST 10 TO 15 KNOTS ACROSS THE BAY AND GULF WATERS. SEAS ARE RUNNING 
A LITTLE HIGHER THAN FORECAST...WITH SIGNIFICANT SEAS 3 TO 5 
FEET...HIGHER IN THE GULF STREAM. THE CHANCE FOR THUNDER IS REMOTE 
FOR THE FLORIDA BAY AND GULF WATERS...HOWEVER SOME THUNDERSTORMS 
CANNOT BE RULED OUT OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE STRAITS. 

&&

.AVIATION...
LARGE AREAS OF RAIN AND CEILINGS ASSOCIATED WITH MULTIPLE CLOUD 
LAYERS WILL AFFECT THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND THE ISLAND TERMINALS 
OVERNIGHT. PREVAILING CONDITIONS WILL BE VFR AS MOST RAIN WILL BE 
TOO LIGHT TO RESTRICT VISIBILITY TO BELOW THE MVFR THRESHOLD. 
PREVAILING CEILINGS WILL GENERALLY BE 5000-1000 FT AGL...BUT WITH 
AREAS OF LOWER MVFR CEILINGS BASED AROUND 2500 FT AGL. IT IS 
DIFFICULT TO GAUGE THE COVERAGE/FREQUENCY OF MVFR OR IFR 
VISIBILITIES IN RAIN...BUT IT APPEARS THAT SUCH CONDITIONS ARE 
LIMITED TO 25% OF THE ROUTE OR LESS AT ANY GIVEN TIME. THERE WILL BE 
A FEW BRIEF LOCAL IFR CEILINGS ALONG THE ROUTE AS WELL...ASSOCIATED 
WITH HEAVIER RAIN SHOWERS. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE 
NORTHEAST TO EAST AT 8-12 KT WITH VERY OCCASIONAL GUSTS TO 15-18 KT.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
215 PM EST SAT DEC 16 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500 TO 200 MB)...AS OF 
200 PM...SATELLITE IMAGERY AND UPPER AIR OBSERVATIONS CONTINUE TO 
DEPICT A SPLIT FLOW PATTERN CONTINUING ACROSS THE CONUS...WITH A 
NEAR 100 KNOT 250 MB JET MOVING ACROSS OLD MEXICO...THE GULF OF 
MEXICO...AND OVER WESTERN CUBA AS WELL AS THE FLORIDA KEYS. UPPER 
LEVEL STREAMLINE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WELL DEFINED SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...WITH WATER VAPOR IMAGERY 
ILLUSTRATING MUCH DRIER MID AND UPPER LEVEL AIR ON THE WEST SIDE OF 
THE TROUGH. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB) ON THE SYNOPTIC 
SCALE...A 1023 MB ANTICYCLONE REMAINS POSITIONED OVER THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...A PERSISTENT AND NEARLY 
STATIONARY SURFACE TROUGH IS POSITIONED FROM THE NORTHWEST BAHAMAS 
SOUTHWEST ACROSS CUBA TO THE YUCATAN PENINSULA. THE KEYS LIE BENEATH 
STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT...WITHIN SHALLOW AND MOIST NORTHEAST FLOW IN 
FROM THE SURFACE TO 5000 FEET...AND MOISTURE LADEN SOUTHWEST WINDS 
FROM 8000 TO 25000 FEET...COINCIDENT WITH THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
PACIFIC JET.

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY OVER THE ISLANDS 
AND THE ADJOINING WATERS. KEY WEST RADAR IS ILLUSTRATING WIDESPREAD 
RAINFALL OVER ALL AREAS EXCEPT THE LOWER KEYS...HOWEVER A LARGE AREA 
OF EMBEDDED HEAVIER SHOWERS ARE ENCROACHING UPON THE LOWER KEYS FROM 
THE WEST. DESPITE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER LIMITING 
INSOLATION...TEMPERATURES HAVE TOPPED OUT IN THE MIDDLE 70S. SURFACE 
WINDS OVER THE ISLANDS ARE LIGHT AND NORTHEAST BETWEEN 3 AND 8 
KNOTS...AND VARIABLE BETWEEN 1 AND 10 KNOTS ALONG THE FLORIDA 
REEF...EXCEPT SUSTAINED AT 15 KNOTS AT PULASKI SHOAL IN THE VICINITY 
OF HEAVIER SHOWERS. 

.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500-200 MB)...TONIGHT THROUGH 
TOMORROW NIGHT. 12Z NAM AND GFS MODELS SHOW THAT THE DEEPEST 
MOISTURE AND SYNOPTIC LIFT APPEARS TO REMAIN NEAR THE KEYS THROUGH 
TOMORROW MORNING...AS THE SHORTWAVE IN THE EASTERN GULF APPROACHES 
THE ISLANDS.

MONDAY THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND...MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
SHORTWAVE AXIS WILL SLIDE TO NEAR THE BAHAMAS FOR MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY. A NEAR 590 DEKAMETER 500 MB WARM CORE ANTICYCLONE IS 
FORECAST TO BUILD OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THIS ANTICYCLONE 
WILL SLIDE EASTWARD TO ACROSS FLORIDA AND THE KEYS THROUGH THE REST 
OF THE WEEK...ALLOWING FOR DRYING AND WARMING ASSOCIATED WITH 
SUBSIDENCE ALOFT. THEREAFTER...12Z GFS INDICATES THAT THE ACTIVE AND 
MOIST SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE JET WILL RETURN OVERHEAD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY NEXT WEEKEND.

IN THE LOWER AND MID-LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...BOTH 12Z GFS AND 
NAM FORECAST MODELS MAINTAIN STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT AT 300K 
OVER/NEAR THE KEYS THRU TOMORROW MORNING. THIS IS IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED STATIONARY SURFACE FRONTAL TROUGH. THE 12Z 
12 HOUR POP #NUMBERS FOR THE KEYS OVERNIGHT REMAIN BETWEEN 80 AND 
100 PERCENT...AND 30 TO 60 PERCENT ON SUNDAY. WIDESPREAD 
INTERMITTENT LIGHT TO MODERATE RAINFALL SHOULD PREDOMINATE AS WEAK 
WAVES SLIDE WITHIN THE MOIST STREAM. THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
WILL OCCUR IN ISOLATED EMBEDDED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...BUT 
BASED ON THE POSITION OF THE SURFACE FRONT AND THE CURRENT JET 
DYNAMICS...THE DEEPEST LIFT AND DYNAMICS SHOULD REMAIN SOUTH OVER 
THE SOUTHERN FLORIDA STRAITS. 

THE 1023 MB ANTICYCLONE NOW CENTERED OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES 
WILL GRADUALLY SLIDE OFFSHORE BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON...AND ELONGATE 
INTO A 1025 MB WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE TOMORROW NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT. THIS WILL CAUSE THE SURFACE TROUGH TO GRADUALLY BREAK DOWN. 
AS A RESULT...NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS WILL INCREASE A BIT OVER THE 
ISLANDS AND THE MARINE DISTRICT.

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...THE AFOREMENTIONED WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY BUILD NORTH OF THE KEYS. AS A 
RESULT...NORTHEAST WINDS SHOULD INCREASE OVER THE ISLANDS AS SKIES 
BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD RETURN TO NEAR NORMAL.

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER WEAK UNSEASONABLY WEAK COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES FROM THE 
PLAINS...WHILE THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE REMAINS WELL ESTABLISHED 
NORTH OF THE KEYS. NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND POPS SHOULD CONTINUE.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...A STRONGER AND SLIGHTLY COLDER...NEAR 
1033 MB ANTICYCLONE...WILL BUILD ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS...AND SLIDE 
EASTWARD ON WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. A NEAR 1030 MB RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE NORTH OF THE KEYS THROUGH THIS TIME WILL MAINTAIN BREEZY 
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE ISLANDS. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS NOW 
APPEAR HIGHLY PROBABLE ON ALL WATERS BY THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. 
 
&&

.MARINE...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...NO HEADLINES OR ADVISORIES  
ATTM. ONLY ISSUE WILL BE ISOLATED EMBEDDED HEAVIER SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AFFECTING MARINERS ON ALL WATERS. WINDS AND SEAS WILL 
BE HIGHER IN ANY HEAVIER SHOWERS AND STORMS. ON MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH THE BUILDING RIDGE...EXERCISE CAUTION 
CAUTIONARY CONDITIONS SEEM MORE PROBABLE OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS. 
BY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...A NEAR 1030 MB RIDGE WILL PROBABLY 
PRODUCE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS ACROSS AT LEAST THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS...AND POSSIBLY OVER THE BAY AND GULF WATERS.  
 
&&

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT EYW AND MTH AND ALONG 
EYW-MIA FLIGHT ROUTE TONIGHT. HOWEVER...LAYERS OF CLOUDS WILL REMAIN 
THICK THROUGH ABOUT 15 KFT. ALSO...LARGE AND PERSISTENT AREAS OF -RA 
WILL CONTINUE OVER THE ENTIRE SERVICE. BRIEF MVFR TO IFR CEILINGS 
AND VISIBILITIES ARE POSSIBLE IN PERIODIC HEAVIER 
RAINS.THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE...BUT SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED 
FROM LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY MORNING.

DEPICT A SPLIT FLOW PATTERN CONTINUING ACROSS THE CONUS...WITH A 
NEAR 100 KNOT 250 MB JET MOVING ACROSS OLD MEXICO...THE GULF OF 
MEXICO...AND THE FLORIDA KEYS. UPPER LEVEL STREAMLINE ANALYSIS 
DEPICTS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER MOVING EASTWARD ACROSS LOUISIANA AND 
THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...BUT THERE ARE SEVERAL SMALL SCALE 
IMPULSES AHEAD OF THIS SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE GULF AND THE KEYS 
WITHIN THIS VERY MOIST AND FAST MOVING SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE JET.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB) A 1020-1022 MB

SKIES ACROSS THE ISLANDS AND ADJOINING WATERS. KEY WEST AND MIAMI 
RADAR SCANS ARE PRESENTLY DETECTING WIDESPREAD LIGHT RAIN OVER THE 
ENTIRE COUNTY WARNING AREA WITH ISOLATED EMBEDDED SHOWERS OVER THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS...AND JUST A FEW THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE FAR EASTERN 
FLORIDA STRAITS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 70 DEGREES WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
THE MIDDLE 60S. SURFACE WINDS ALONG THE REEF AND FLORIDA BAY ARE 
LIGHT AND EASTERLY TO NORTHEASTERLY.  

.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS (500-200MB)...TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...THE SHORTWAVE OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO WILL 
MOVE INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE...MODELS 
INDICATE SMALL IMPULSES OR VORTICITY CENTERS IN THE UPPER FLOW. 
LATEST 06Z MODEL RUNS CONTINUE TO SHOW DECENT OMEGA FIELDS OVER THE 
KEYS...INDICATIVE OF GOOD SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT.

IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE LEVELS...06Z GFS MAINTAINS STRONG ISENTROPIC 
LIFT THROUGHOUT THE DAY ACROSS THE KEYS...THE FRONTAL TROUGH 
REMAINING IN NEARLY THE SAME PLACE...SOUTH OF THE KEYS. THE 12Z 
MORNING SOUNDING STILL INDICATES THAT SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY 
EXISTS...BUT THE BEST CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS 
THE OUTER FLORIDA STRAITS...WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE FURTHER 
DESTABILIZED SOUTH OF THE STALLED FRONT. 12 HOUR RAIN CHANCES ARE IN 
THE LOW CATEGORICAL RANGE. BASED ON CURRENT COVERAGE OF 
ACCUMULATING LIGHT RAIN OVER THE AREA...DO NOT SEE A NEED TO LOWER 
NO CHANCE POPS...SO A RARE 100 PERCENT REMAINS AT THIS TIME. SO NO 
CHANGES TODAY.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
340 AM EST SAT DEC 16 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS HAS BLANKETED SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
KEYS...AS WELL AS THE SURROUNDING WATERS. RAIN HAS BEEN CONTINUALLY 
FALLING SINCE EARLIER LAST EVENING ALONG THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN. 
EMBEDDED HEAVIER SHOWERS WITHIN THIS LARGE AREA OF RAIN HAVE 
REMAINED OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA...WITH THE HEAVIEST ACTIVITY 
NOW CONCENTRATED SOME 40 TO 60 MILES SOUTH OF THE MIDDLE AND LOWER 
KEYS. TEMPERATURES AT KEYS LAND LOCATIONS HAVE HELD STEADY IN THE 
LOWER 70S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70 DEGREES. KEYS 
LAND LOCATIONS AS WELL AS CMAN PLATFORMS HAVE REPORTED A VARIETY OF 
WIND DIRECTIONS OVERNIGHT...AVERAGING FROM 5 TO 10 KNOTS. 

.FORECAST...
FOR TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...
CLOUDY AND RAINY CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY AND TONIGHT DUE TO 
JET DYNAMICS...MID TO UPPER LEVEL VORTICITY...AND ISENTROPIC LIFT. A 
SURFACE TROUGH LOCATED OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS EARLY THIS 
MORNING...WILL REMAIN NEAR THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT. MEANWHILE...A 
MID TO UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH...CURRENTLY LOCATED OVER THE 
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD OVER FLORIDA 
TONIGHT. RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS COULD BE AS HIGH AS ANOTHER INCH OR 
TWO OF RAIN TODAY AND TONIGHT. CONDITIONS WILL BEGIN TO IMPROVE OVER 
THE KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS GRADUALLY ON SUNDAY...WITH CONDITIONS 
RETURNING TO NEAR NORMAL BY SUNDAY NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN 
OVER THE AREA FROM THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES AND WESTERN 
ATLANTIC. 
 
FOR MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL REMAIN 
NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH MONDAY...AND GRADUALLY MERGE WITH A LARGER 
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING EASTWARD OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES 
WEDNESDAY. THIS HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY SHIFT INTO THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. MUCH DRIER CONDITIONS AS WELL 
AS NEAR NORMAL TO A COUPLE OF DEGREE ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
&&

.MARINE...
VARIABLE WINDS WILL PERSIST TODAY AND TONIGHT...AS THE TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS REMAINS NEARBY. THEREAFTER...WINDS 
WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE SUNDAY FROM THE NORTHEAST AS HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN FROM THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES AND WESTERN ATLANTIC. 
AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS...WINDS WILL REACH SMALL CRAFT 
EXERCISE CAUTION CRITERIA OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS...AND NEAR 15 
KNOTS OVER THE BAY AND GULF WATERS. THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE THAT 
WINDS MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED TO SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY LEVELS...BUT 
FORECASTER CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH AT THIS TIME. LATER IN THE WEEK AS 
A STRONGER HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BUILDS IN FROM THE EASTERN UNITED 
STATES (WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SCA HEADLINES MAY BE NEEDED. 
STAY TUNED.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS A LARGE AREA OF RAIN COVERING MUCH OF THE NEARSHORE AND 
OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE REGION FROM OCEAN REEF TO THE DRY 
TORTUGAS. THIS AREA OF RAIN IS MORE SPOTTY IN NATURE FROM THE KEYS 
NORTHWARD. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND 
ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...
ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST NEAR 10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 
70S. ONLY ABOUT FOUR DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT DUE TO 
LIGHT NORTH TO NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES 
IN THE UPPER 70S.

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS 
TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE AND VERY MOIST...WITH 
A PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE JUST UNDER TWO INCHES. ATMOSPHERIC 
MOISTURE WILL REMAIN CONSTANT TONIGHT. A COUPLE OF ILL-DEFINED 
EMBEDDED PERTURBATIONS WITHIN SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE TONIGHT. STRONGER 
CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF THE TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE 
TONIGHT. NORTH OF THE TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE...PATCHES OF LIGHT TO 
MODERATE RAINFALL WILL AFFECT MORE THAN HALF OF THE KEYS TONIGHT. IN 
SUMMARY...PLENTY OF MOISTURE...A NEARBY TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE AND 
WEAK LARGE SCALE ASCENT WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR LIKELY POPS FOR 
TONIGHT...WHICH IS WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. THE 
CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS HANDLES THIS SITUATION 
WELL...SO NO UPDATES ARE EXPECTED.  

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE NORTH TO NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS SHOULD PREVAIL ON ALL KEYS 
WATERS TONIGHT. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY NIGHT. 

&&

.AVIATION...
WE HAVE MUCH TO DISCUSS. A DECAYED SURFACE BOUNDARY LURKING JUST 
SOUTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL PRODUCE AREAS OF RAIN AND ISOLATED 
SHOWERS OVER MUCH OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE TONIGHT. MOST RAIN 
WILL BE TOO LIGHT TO RESTRICT VISIBILITY TO MVFR THRESHOLDS...BUT 
SHOWERS AND POCKETS OF HEAVIER RAIN WILL PRODUCE MVFR VISIBILITIES 
AND CEILINGS. COVERAGE OF SUCH CONDITIONS IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN 
LOCAL AS THE RAIN SPREADS ALONG THE KEYS PORTION OF THE KMIA-KEYW 
FLIGHT ROUTE...AND MOVES OVER THE MAINLAND SOMETIME AFTER 06Z. 
HOWEVER...IT IS POSSIBLE THAT MVFR CEILINGS COULD BECOME MORE 
WIDESPREAD IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS.

WITH THE BOUNDARY STALLED SOUTH OF THE KEYS...WINDS ALONG THE ROUTE 
AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS SHOULD BE GENERALLY NORTH TO NORTHEAST 
AND VERY WEAK...6 KT OR LESS AND CALM OVER MUCH OF THE MAINLAND 
INTERIOR. COUPLED WITH HIGH SOIL MOISTURE AND DEWPOINTS...THIS WILL 
RESULT IN MIST/FOG DEVELOPING OVER THE EVERGLADES IN THE EARLY 
MORNING HOURS. AT THIS TIME...THE COVERAGE AND THICKNESS OF SUCH 
MIST/FOG IS UNCERTAIN...SO HAVE INCLUDED ONLY LCL MVFR CONDITIONS IN 
THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE FORECAST. IF 
MIST/FOG IS MORE WIDESPREAD AND/OR DENSE THIS WILL NEED TO BE 
UPDATED.

LYING ACROSS THE ISLAND CHAIN AND THE NEARBY ADJACENT WATERS. 
MEANWHILE...EARLY VISIBLE PHOTOGRAPHS AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY REVEAL 
ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF MID AND UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES JUST NORTH 
OF THE YUCATAN CHANNEL...WITH THE SUBTROPICAL JET STREAM ALIGNED 
FROM OLD MEXICO TO ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO AND FLORIDA PENINSULA. 
BECAUSE OF THE NEARBY TROUGH...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS 
DEPICT WINDS VARYING FROM SOUTH AT 7 KNOTS AT SAND KEY 
LIGHT...TO MOSTLY NORTHEAST NEAR 5 KNOTS FROM SOMBRERO KEY LIGHT TO 
MOLASSES REEF. MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING AN AREA OF 
SHOWERS MOVING NORTHEAST THROUGH THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE WATERS 
OF THE UPPER KEYS...WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE DISTANT WATERS 
SOUTH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS. HOWEVER...AN INCREASING AREA OF

EXTREMELY MOIST (PWAT 1.98 INCHES) AND CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS...WITH A FAIRLY MODEST AND DEEP UNIDIRECTIONAL SOUTHWEST 
STRENGTHENING ABOVE 500 MB.   

.FORECAST...
WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE IN PLACE AND THE AFOREMENTIONED LOW

OF THE YUCATAN CHANNEL SHOULD PROVIDE SOME LARGE SCALE MID AND UPPER 
LEVEL LIFT THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. THEREFORE...HAVE ALREADY 
UPDATED THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST TO TRANSITION FROM ISOLATED POPS 
THIS MORNING GIVING WAY TO LIKELY POPS THIS AFTERNOON.

TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE TROUGH...AS WELL AS CONVERGENT WINDS AND 
AMPLE MOISTURE. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD BEGIN TO DECREASE SATURDAY 
THROUGH SUNDAY...AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN OVER THE KEYS FROM THE 
EASTERN UNITED STATES AND THE MID TO UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE DEPARTS 
INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. 
 
EXTENDED (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WILL MOVE OFF THE 
CAROLINA COASTLINE...AND LINGER THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK. A RETURN

OFFSHORE WATERS WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY...AS WELL AS OVER THE 
OFFSHORE WATERS WEST AND SOUTHWEST OF THE LOWER KEYS. ELSEWHERE...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY. WINDS 
OVER LAND ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON 
AVERAGE...ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST NEAR 10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN 
THE MID 70S. ONLY ABOUT THREE DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED 
OVERNIGHT DUE TO GENTLE NORTH TO NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER 
WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S.

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL 
APPROACH THE KEYS TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE 
WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUE JUST ABOVE ONE AND THREE 
QUARTERS OF AN INCH. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL INCREASE TONIGHT. BY 
SUNRISE FRIDAY...PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE JUST UNDER TWO INCHES. AN 
APPROACHING TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE COUPLED WITH A MOIST AND UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS IN PLACE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR AT LEAST HIGH CHANCE POPS 
FOR TONIGHT...WHICH IS WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. THE 
ONLY POSSIBLE UPDATE ANTICIPATED TO THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS FOR 
THE FLORIDA KEYS WOULD BE TO INCREASE POPS FOR TONIGHT...BUT THIS 
DOES NOT SEEM NECESSARY AT THIS TIME.  

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE NORTH TO NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS SHOULD PREVAIL ON ALL KEYS 
WATERS TONIGHT. WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE HIGHER NEAR ANY SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS TONIGHT. NO ADVISORIES OR 
CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY 
NIGHT. 

&&

.AVIATION...
SEVERAL FEATURES WILL AFFECT AVIATION ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST  
FLIGHT ROUTE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF TONIGHT. A PERSISTENT LINE OF 
SHOWERS CONTINUES TO AFFECT THE UPPER KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA. THIS 
ACTIVITY IS PRODUCING ISOLATED IFR CONDITIONS...BUT SHOULD REMAIN ON 
THE PERIPHERY OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE. CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO SLOWLY ENCROACH THE FLORIDA KEYS FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST AND WEST. THIS ACTIVITY IS THROWING OUT LIGHT RAIN AND VFR 
CEILINGS AROUND 6KFT AND BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KFT ACROSS THE KMIA-KEYW 
FLIGHT ROUTE. THE SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO EVENTUALLY 
AFFECT THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...HOWEVER TIMING IS NOT POSSIBLE. 
THERE IS A CHANCE THAT SOME OF THESE HEAVIER SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY 
MOVE INTO THE SOUTHWESTERN PORTION OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE 
OVERNIGHT WITH WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR CONDITIONS...AND ISOLATED IFR 
CONDITIONS.

THERE IS AN AIRMET IN EFFECT FOR MODERATE ICING BETWEEN FL140 AND 
FL260. MODERATE ICING SHOULD END BY 1000 AM FRIDAY MORNING. 
PILOTS...PLEASE CHECK THE LATEST AIRMETS AND SIGMETS BEFORE 
DEPARTURE.

A STATIONARY TROUGH REACHING FROM THE YUCATAN PENINSULA INTO THE

OFFSHORE OF THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES COAST. ACROSS THE MARINE 
DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS INDICATE NORTHEAST TO

DESTABILIZE OUR ATMOSPHERE A TAD THIS AFTERNOON AND ESPECIALLY 
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE MAIN LOW LEVEL CONFLUENCE BOUNDARY AND RIGHT

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
330 AM EST THU DEC 14 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK TROF IS ANALYZED STRETCHING FROM THE YUCATAN NORTHWARD INTO 
THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO.  ISENTROPIC LIFT IS TAKING PLACE ON THE 
EAST SIDE OF THIS TROF...SPREADING SHOWERS AS FAR EAST AS THE DRY 
TORTUGAS...WITH EVEN A FEW SPRINKLES NOTED OVER THE KEYS.  THE 88D 
WIND PROFILE INDICATES THAT THE ISENTROPIC LIFT IS INCREASING AS 
SOUTHEAST WINDS BECOME MORE COMMON THROUGHOUT THE LOW LEVELS.  
ALOFT...A DECENT CAPPING INVERSION IS IN PLACE AT AROUND 850 
MB...BUT THE ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL RAPIDLY ERODE THIS.  FURTHER 
ALOFT...THE SOUNDING IS NEARLY MOIST ADIABATIC ABOVE THE INVERSION.  
WINDS VEER WITH HEIGHT ALL THE WAY TO 35KFT...INDICATING DEEP WARM 
ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT.  LOOKING WESTWARD...AN APPROACHING 
UPPER AND MID LEVEL TROF IS INCREASING WINDS AND DIVERGENCE ALOFT 
ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF.  

.FORECAST...
SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)
THE MODELS ARE FINALLY COMING INTO AGREEMENT ON HOW TO HANDLE THE 
TROF IN THE GULF.  WITH MINOR VARIATIONS IN TIME AND 
INTENSITY...THEY BASICALLY TILT THE NORTHERN END OF IT EASTWARD 
ACROSS CENTRAL FL BY TONIGHT...SO THAT ITS PARALLEL TO THE WINDS 
ALOFT...LEAVING IT STRETCHED FROM CENTRAL FL TO THE YUCATAN ON FRIDAY AND 
THEN TRANSLATE IT SLIGHTLY EASTWARD SO THAT IT IS FINALLY STALLED 
ACROSS THE STRAITS ON SATURDAY.  AT THE SAME TIME...WEAK UPPER LEVEL 
DIVERGENCE IS PROVIDED BY A FEW SMALL SHORTWAVES MOVING THROUGH THE 
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.  THE RESULT IS WEAK SURFACE CONVERGENCE 
COUPLED WITH WEAK UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE ON FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...PROCEEDED BY A PERIOD OF DEEP ISENTROPIC LIFT TODAY AND 
TONIGHT.  

INTERESTINGLY...THE WIND PROFILE TODAY IS FAIRLY GOOD FOR 
THUNDER...BUT THE DEEP LIFT WILL QUICKLY CREATE A MOIST ADIABATIC 
LAPSE RATE THAT WILL BEGIN ALMOST AT THE SURFACE...LEAVING LITTLE 
CAPE...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE LACK OF SURFACE HEATING DUE TO CLOUD 
COVER.  THE BEST CHANCE FOR THUNDER WOULD BE THIS MORNING...BEFORE 
THE MOIST ADIABATIC LAYER IS LOWERED BY THE LIFT...WHICH WILL ALSO 
LOWER THE CAPE.  ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT DO GET GOING TODAY WILL BE 
RATHER DISORGANIZED AND SHORT LIVED AND RARE. 

SCATTERED SHOWERS CAN BE EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD...BEGINNING 
AROUND MID DAY TODAY.  

EXTENDED 
AFTER THE SURFACE TROF DISSIPATES AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ALOFT ON 
SUNDAY...THE NORMAL EASTERLY FLOW AND ISOLATED SHOWERS AND NORMAL 
TEMPS WILL RETURN FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  
&&

.MARINE...
IT APPEARS THAT THE GRADIENT AROUND THE INCOMING SURFACE TROF WILL 
BE FAIRLY WEAK...AND THAT WINDS SHOULD NOT DO MORE THAN CHANGE 
DIRECTION WITH ITS PASSAGE.  BY SATURDAY...THE TROF WILL BE STALLED 
AND WEAKENING...LEAVING FAIRLY LIGHT EASTERLY WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS 
FOR THE WEEKEND. 

&&

.AVIATION...
MULTIPLE CLOUD LAYERS WILL BE FOUND ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
TODAY...WITH PREVAILING CEILINGS GENERALLY BASED BETWEEN FL120 AND 
FL200. BENEATH THESE HIGHER CEILINGS...LOWER CLOUDS WILL BE BASED 
ANYWHERE FROM FL010 TO FL050...WITH LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS AFFECTING 
THE ROUTE THROUGH THE DAY. AS WIND PROFILES BECOME MORE FAVORABLE 
FOR ISENTROPIC LIFT BY THIS AFTERNOON...OVERALL LOW TO MID-LEVEL 
CLOUD COVER SHOULD INCREASE...ALONG WITH RAIN CHANCES...AND MVFR 
CONDITIONS MAY BECOME SOMEWHAT MORE PREVALENT. HOWEVER...THIS IS TOO 
UNCERTAIN TO INDICATE IN THE TAF OR TWEB PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME. 
SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE 10 KT OR LESS FROM NORTHEAST 
TO EAST THIS MORNING...BECOMING EAST TO SOUTHEAST BY AROUND MIDDAY.

.CURRENTLY...
SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WEAKENING WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE REACHING 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES...WITH A PERSISTENT...LENGTHY AND 
STATIONARY TROUGH REACHING FROM THE YUCATAN PENINSULA INTO THE 
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION 
PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS INDICATE MOSTLY EAST WINDS RANGING FROM NEAR 
10 KNOTS AT LONG KEY...TO NEAR 15 KNOTS AND GUSTY ELSEWHERE. 
MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING A FEW SPRINKLES IN AND AROUND 
THE EXTREME LOWER KEYS...BUT WITH FALSE ECHOES OVER THE MARQUESAS 
KEYS AND DRY TORTUGAS. ELSEWHERE...A CONVECTIVELY ACTIVE CUBAN LAND 
BREEZE IS GENERATING A CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS BEYOND 40 MILES 
SOUTHWEST OF DRY TORTUGAS. OTHERWISE...OUR MORNING SOUNDING REVEALS 
CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY UNDERNEATH A 2 DEGREE C INVERSION BASED AT 
850 MB...WITH ANOTHER WEAK 1 DEGREE C INVERSION BASED NEAR 20000 
FEET. AMPLE MOISTURE (PWAT 1.58 INCHES) WITHIN AN EASTERLY FLOW 
REACHES UP TO 700 MB...WITH WINDS VEERING TO WESTERLY ABOVE 500 MB. 

.FORECAST...
ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF WEAK MID AND UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL 
MOVE THROUGH THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...AND ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. FURTHERMORE...PATCHES OF STRATOCUMULUS 
UNDERNEATH THE AFOREMENTIONED LOW LEVEL INVERSION WILL PASS THROUGH 
THE ISLAND CHAIN. HENCE...THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST WILL BE ADJUSTED 
TO INCLUDE CHANGEABLE SKIES ALONG ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS. 

&&

.MARINE...
AN EARLIER QUIKSCAT PASS FROM 1025Z DEPICTED EAST WINDS OF 15 TO 20 
KNOTS OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS WITH 10 TO 15 KNOTS NORTH OF THE 
ISLAND CHAIN. BECAUSE OF THE PROLONGED DURATION OF FRESH EASTERLY 
WINDS AND CURRENT OBSERVATIONS...WILL INSERT AN EXERCISE CAUTION 
HEADLINE FOR SEAS ON THE ATLANTIC WATERS. OTHERWISE...10 TO 15 KNOTS 
ON THE BAY AND GULF WATERS WILL BE MAINTAINED. 
&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KEY WEST TO 
MIAMI AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS OF KEY WEST AND 
MARATHON. LOW CLOUDS WILL BE BASED ANYWHERE FROM 2000-5000 FT 
AGL...PRODUCING AREAS OF VFR CEILINGS AND LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS 
BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000 FT AGL. HIGHER CLOUDS WILL PRODUCE PREVAILING 
CEILINGS ANYWHERE FROM 12000-20000 FT AGL...ESPECIALLY THIS MORNING 
AND EARLY AFTERNOON. OTHER THAN A FEW SPRINKLES AND LIGHT 
SHOWERS...NO PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED. SURFACE WINDS AT KEY WEST 
AND MARATHON WILL GENERALLY BE NORTHEAST TO EAST AT 10 KT OR LESS. 
THOSE FLYING OVER THE PENINSULA SHOULD BE AWARE THAT LIGHT TO 
MODERATE TURBULENCE HAS BEEN REPORTED MAINLY IN THE FL150 TO FL180 
LAYER...WITH ONE PILOT REPORT OF MODERATE TO SEVERE TURBULENCE 
OCCURRING NEAR FL150 JUST NORTH OF ORLANDO. THERE IS ALSO AN AIRMET

315 AM EST WED DEC 13 2006

.DISCUSSION...
A LOW MOVING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES HAS PUSHED THE HIGH PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OFF OF THE EAST COAST...RELAXING THE WINDS THAT HAVE BEEN 
BLOWING ACROSS THE AREA FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS.  WINDS HAVE BEEN IN 
THE 15 TO 20 RANGE AT THE REEF...AND 10 OR LESS ON LAND THIS 
MORNING.  A COLD FRONT...ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW...IS STALLING OUT 
OVER NORTHERN FL AND THE NORTHERN GULF.  MEANWHILE...A WEAK LOW 
CONTINUES TO SIT IN THE NORTHWEST CARRIBEAN.  SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE 
AIRMASS OVER THE KEYS IS FAIRLY STABLE...WITH A LOT OF HIGH LEVEL 
MOISTURE...RESULTING IN MOSTLY STRATIFORM CLOUDS.  

.FORECAST...
THE GFS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS IN BRINGING 
THE WESTERN CARIB LOW UP THE STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT...THROUGH THE EASTERN GULF AND THEN ACROSS FLORIDA ON 
SATURDAY...OR ELSE IN DEVELOPING A DIFFERENT LOW ALONG THE FRONT.  
UNFORTUNATELY...IT HAS NOT BEEN CONSISTENT ON THE TIMING AND 
STRENGTH OF THIS LOW AS IT MOVES ACROSS FL. THE WHOLE SCENARIO 
HINGES ON THE UPPER AND MID LEVEL FLOW BECOMING MORE SOUTHWEST 
ACROSS THE GULF AND CARIB IN RESPONSE TO A MID LATITUDE SYSTEM 
CURRENTLY MOVING ONSHORE ON THE WEST COAST.  THIS SOUTHWEST FLOW 
WILL LIKELY HAVE ENOUGH ENERGY TO FURTHER DEVELOP AND MOVE THE LOW 
INTO THE GULF AND ACROSS FL...OR TO CREATE CYCLOGENESIS ON THE FRONT 
AND MOVE THAT ACROSS FL...BUT IT IS LIKELY THAT THE MODEL DOES NOT 
HAVE A HANDLE ON THE TIMING.  THE UNCERTAINTY IS FURTHER EMPHASIZED 
BY THE LACK OF AGREEMENT FROM THE OTHER MODELS AND EVEN IN THE GFS 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS.  

GIVEN LACK OF STRENGTH NOTED ON SATELLITE IN THE SOUTHERN PART OF 
THE SYSTEM MOVING ONTO THE WEST COAST...WILL ASSUME THAT THE CARIB 
LOW WILL NOT GET PICKED UP...BUT INSTEAD A LOW WILL DEVELOP ALONG 
THE FRONT.  THE FRONT WILL LIKELY BE STALLED WELL TO THE NORTH...AND 
THE LOW WILL RIDE ALONG THE FRONT TOO FAR NORTH TO BRING MUCH PRECIP 
TO THE KEYS.  WILL INCREASE POPS ONLY SLIGHTLY FOR FRI-SAT AND LET 
FUTURE PACKAGES FINE TUNE THE TIMING.  

&&

.MARINE...
THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR SEAS WILL BE ALLOWED TO EXPIRE.  WINDS 
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN...DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN 
STRENGTH...TIMING AND POSITION OF THE LOW THAT IS EXPECTED TO PASS 
TO THE NORTH.  
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. LOW CLOUDS WILL BE BASED ANYWHERE FROM 
2000-5000 FT AGL...PRODUCING AREAS OF VFR CEILINGS AND LOCAL MVFR 
CEILINGS BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000 FT AGL. HIGHER CLOUDS WILL PRODUCE 
PREVAILING CEILINGS ANYWHERE FROM 12000-20000 FT AGL...ESPECIALLY 
THIS MORNING. OTHER THAN A FEW SPRINKLES AND LIGHT SHOWERS...NO 
PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL

MAINLY MODERATE EAST TO NORTHEAST BREEZE. KBYX IS ONLY DISPLAYING 
ECHOES FROM THE ELEVATED CLOUDS WELL OUT OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS 
AND MORE SCALED ECHOES FROM LOWER CLOUDS IN THE WATERS SOUTH OF THE 
DRY TORTUGAS THIS EVENING.

.FORECAST...
THERE WILL BE A MORE UNIFORM FEED OF UPPER CLOUDS STREAMING BACK IN 
FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO LATER ON IN THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. AS HAS 
BEEN THE CASE OVER THE PAST FEW EVENINGS...THE CHANCE OF MEASURABLE 
PRECIPITATION IS SMALL BUT WORTH THE SLIGHTEST MENTION. TEMPERATURES

THROUGH TONIGHT. THE AFTERNOON MARINE FORECAST IS HANDLING THE 
EXPECTED CONDITIONS NICELY IN ALL MARINE ZONES...NO ADJUSTMENTS WILL 
BE INCORPORATED INTO THE LATE EVENING MARINE UPDATE.

HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH AND LOW PRESSURE TO THE SOUTH CONTINUE TO

OVER THE WATER AND IN THE 15 KNOT RANGE OVER LAND THIS MORNING.  THE 
AIRMASS IN PLACE IS RELATIVELY STABLE...YET MOIST...RESULTING IN 
MULTIPLE LAYERS OF STRATUS ACROSS THE AREA.  SOME OF THE HIGHER 
CLOUDS ARE BLOW OFF FROM THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
INTERESTING LOW PRESSURE CENTER THAT IS DEVELOPING IN THE WESTERN 
CARIB.  

.FORECAST...
THE HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH IS EXPECTED TO SLIDE EASTWARD 
TODAY...RELAXING THE GRADIENT A BIT AND ALLOWING WINDS TO DROP A BIT 
BY LATE AFTERNOON.  THIS PATTERN OF MOIST...YET STABLE AIR AND 
EASTERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AT LEAST THURSDAY.

THE FORECAST GETS INTERESTING ON FRIDAY.  THE MODELS DIVERGE ON HOW 
TO HANDLE THE LOW THAT IS DEVELOPING IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN.  NONE 
OF THEM ARE CORRECTLY ANALYZING IT YET...NOR ARE THEY CATCHING THE 
UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE SUPPORTING IT THAT IS EVIDENT IN THE WATER 
VAPOR.  DESPITE THE LACK OF INITIALIZATION...THE GFS HAS BEEN 
CONSISTENT IN THE IDEA OF A LOW KICKING OUT OF THE CARIB AND MOVING 
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS FL ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT IN RESPONSE TO A 
MID LATITUDE UPPER LEVEL IMPULSE THAT DIGS INTO THE NORTHERN GULF.  

THE CONSISTENCY FROM RUN TO RUN GIVES SOME CREDIBILITY TO THE IDEA 
OF MOVING THIS DEVELOPING LOW ACROSS FL.  HOWEVER...AS THE UPPER 
LEVEL DIVERGENT FLOW SMOOTHES OUT IN THE NEXT 48HRS...THIS LOW MAY 
NOT EXIST BY THE TIME THE MID LAT IMPULSE GETS INTO THE GULF.  WILL 
NEED TO WATCH THE TREND OF ITS DEVELOPMENT AND THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW 
FOR THE NEXT 24HRS BEFORE BUYING INTO THE GFS.  WILL ONLY NUDGE POPS 
FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...AND NOT TRY TO PUT IN THE WIND PATTERN 
OF A LOW PASSAGE YET.

A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS CENTERED OVER THE CAROLINA 
COAST...WITH WEAK RIDGING ALOFT. THE LOCAL PRESSURE GRADIENT IS 
STILL QUITE TIGHT. MARINE LOCATIONS ARE REPORTING NEAR 20 KNOTS AND 
GUSTY OUT OF THE NORTHEAST TO EAST. ISLAND LOCATIONS ARE REPORTING 
AROUND 15 MPH. THESE WINDS ARE HOLDING OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES AROUND 
70 DEGREES. GPS INSTRUMENTS INDICATE PWATS AROUND 1.4 INCHES...IN 
CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH LAST EVENINGS SOUNDING. WEAKENING DIVERGENT 
SURFACE FLOW HAS CONTRIBUTED TO THE LACK OF SHOWERS OVER THE 
STRAITS...DESPITE THE STRONG EASTERLY WINDS OVER THE WARM GULF 
STREAM. A SMALL AREA OF DIVERGENT FLOW ALOFT ALONG WITH SOME LOW 
LEVEL TROUGHING IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN HAS CONTRIBUTED TO A LARGE 
SWATH OF MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS STREAMING OVER OUR AREA.

.FORECAST...
THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP STRONG NORTHEAST TO 
EAST WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS THROUGH TUESDAY. 
MEANWHILE...THICK MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM 
ACROSS THE KEYS. DAY TIME HIGHS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 70S OVER THE

WILL CONTINUE TO BE SLIGHT AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT CONTINUES TO

THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVE TROUGHS WILL 
RIDE EASTWARD OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS. THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM 
DOMINATING OUR AREA WILL MERGE WITH ANOTHER HIGH MOVING OFF THE NEW

ATLANTIC. THE LOCAL PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL RELAX SIGNIFICANTLY ON 
WEDNESDAY...AS THIS MOVEMENT WILL PLACE THE KEYS NEAR A CULL...WITH 
THE ATLANTIC HIGH TO THE EAST...A TROUGH TO OUR NORTH...AND ANOTHER 
HIGH OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES.

AT THIS POINT...GUIDANCE HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT RUN TO RUN. EARLIER

MOVES ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THIS WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 70S ALONG THE ISLANDS LATE THIS 
EVENING. KBYX RADAR HAS BEEN VOID OF PRECIPITATION ECHOES...BUT 
LAYERED CLOUDS CONTINUE OVER THE ENTIRE SERVICE AREA WITH NO 
EXTENDED BREAKS EXPECTED THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. WINDS RANGE 
FROM FRESH TO OCCASIONALLY STRONG ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS AND 
MUCH OF OUR GULF ZONES...AND ARE MODERATE TO PERIODICALLY FRESH 
THROUGH THE FLORIDA BAY AND THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF OUR GULF WATERS.

.FORECAST...
THE CHANCE FOR MEASURABLE RAIN IS SMALL...BUT THE STEADY AND MOIST 
EAST FLOW THROUGH ABOUT 5 KFT IS ENOUGH TO KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE IN 
THE FORECAST OVERNIGHT. TEMPERATURES SHOULD NOT FALL MUCH...IF AT 
ALL...FROM THEIR PRESENT READINGS BEFORE SUNRISE. SO...THE AFTERNOON 
ZONE FORECAST IS IN FINE SHAPE WITH NO ZONE UPDATE PLANNED.

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL BE MAINTAINED GULF WATERS...AND OF 
COURSE IN THE ATLANTIC...WHILE THE EXERCISE CAUTION WILL HEADLINE 
THE FLORIDA BAY. DO NOT PLAN TO ADJUST ANYTHING FOR THE LATE EVENING 
MARINE UPDATE.

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT EYW AND MTH...AND ALONG 
THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST TWEB ROUTE. SUSTAINED WINDS WILL AVERAGE 050

THIS MID DECEMBER MORNING ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS. CONSIDERABLE MID 
AND HIGH CLOUDINESS PREVAILS OVER THE KEYS THIS MORNING...AS SEEN 
VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AS WELL AS HUMAN OBSERVATION. KBYX RADAR 
HAS BEEN DETECTING ONLY A FEW SPRINKLES OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA 
SOME 50 MILES SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS OUT PAST DRY TORTUGAS. WINDS 
AT THE CMAN PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN REPORTING NORTHEAST WINDS AROUND 20 
KNOTS WITH GUSTS AROUND 30 KNOTS...EXCEPT FOR LONG KEY WHICH HAS

305 AM EST SUN DEC 10 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN 
ARE VARIABLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE NORTHEAST NEAR 15 MPH. 
C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHEAST TO EAST AT 20 TO 25 
KNOTS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 30 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 60S. 
ONLY ABOUT EIGHT DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO FRESH 
NORTHEAST TO EAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 
UPPER 70S. 

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A LARGE AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED NEAR THE CAROLINAS TODAY AND TONIGHT. IN 
THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BE LOCATED ALONG THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. WINDS SHOULD INCREASE TODAY ACROSS THE KEYS DUE TO BOUNDARY 
LAYER DESTABILIZATION DEVELOPING AFTER SUNRISE. WINDS SHOULD 
DECREASE TO 15 TO 20 MPH OR A BIT LESS TONIGHT ACROSS THE KEYS AS 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER BECOMES STABLE ONCE AGAIN. NO MORE THAN DIME POPS 
ARE NEEDED TODAY AND TONIGHT DUE TO ANTICYCLONIC FLOW IN ALL LEVELS 
OF THE ATMOSPHERE. THE AFOREMENTIONED LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL SHIFT NORTHEASTWARD MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER 
(PWAT) VALUES SHOULD REMAIN BELOW ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH 
MONDAY. LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT SHOULD LIMIT POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE 
CATEGORY MONDAY. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD INCREASE MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY AS WINDS BECOME MORE EASTERLY. BY SUNSET TUESDAY...PWAT 
VALUES SHOULD BE JUST UNDER ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH. DUE 
TO THIS INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE...THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR 
THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL ADVERTISE GRADUALLY ESCALATING POPS MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TUESDAY. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
A SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES 
TUESDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...WEAK LOW PRESSURE MAY DEVELOP OVER THE 
NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO OR THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THIS WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES WEDNESDAY...BEFORE PROGRESSING UP THE 
EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES THURSDAY. THE TRAILING COLD FRONT 
FROM THE PARENT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD NOT MAKE IT TO THE KEYS 
DUE TO ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE 
FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL FEATURE ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES AND RAIN CHANCES TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY TRENDING 
TO NEAR NORMAL VALUES THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY. 

&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR ALL KEYS WATERS TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD SLOWLY DECREASE MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES FARTHER AWAY FROM THE KEYS. BE THAT 
AS IT MAY...A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED FOR 
ATLANTIC WATERS MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY MAY 
BE REQUIRED ON ATLANTIC WATERS TUESDAY UNTIL SEAS SUBSIDE. NO 
ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH TODAY...NORTHEAST WINDS NEAR 15 KNOTS WITH GUSTS OF 20 TO 25 
KNOTS CAN BE EXPECTED ALONG MUCH OF THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT 
ROUTE AND AT KEYS TERMINALS. WINDS ARE A BIT MORE EASTERLY JUST 
ABOVE THE SURFACE. THIS IS CARRYING PATCHES OF VFR CEILINGS (3500 
TO 6000 FT) ACROSS THE EAST SIDE OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AND 
AFFECTING BOTH KEYS TERMINALS. THERE MAY BE OCCASIONAL LIGHT SHOWERS 
EMBEDDED WITHIN THESE PATCHES...BUT VISIBILITIES WILL REMAIN VFR.

.DISCUSSION...
THE LIGHTEST OF SHOWERS CONTINUE IN A RAGGED LINE WELL OUT IN THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS THIS EVENING. OTHERWISE...LATE EVENING IR SATELLITE 
INDICATED A RATHER QUICK DECREASE IN THE CLOUD DECK IN THE 7 TO 10 
KFT LAYER ALONG THE ISLANDS AND ADJACENT COASTAL WATERS. 
HOWEVER...POCKETS OF LOWER CU CAN BE EXPECTED ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
SERVICE AREA...AND AN INCREASE IN CI FROM THE SOUTHWEST OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. A FRESH TO STRONG EAST/NORTHEAST FLOW THROUGH 
ROUGHLY 5 KFT WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MEASURABLE SHOWERS 
OVERNIGHT. BUT HAVE SENT AN UPDATE TO THE ZONES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 
SKY COVER. NO OTHER CHANGES WERE NECESSARY FROM THE AFTERNOON ZONE 
ISSUANCE.

.MARINE...
LONF1 HAS SHOWN A DECREASE IN WINDS OVER THE PAST HOUR BY A COUPLE 
OF KNOTS...BUT STRONG WINDS STILL PERSIST AT ALL AREA. THERE ARE 
STILL A FEW NEAR-GALE FORCE GUSTS AT SOME OF THE ELEVATED CMAN 
SENSORS. BESIDES A MINOR WORDING ADJUSTMENT TO THE FLORIDA BAY ZONE 
INITIAL CONDITIONS...NO CHANGES TO THE LATE EVENING MARINE UPDATE.

.AVIATION...
THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...WINDS WILL CONTINUE NORTHEASTERLY NEAR 15 
KNOTS...WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 20 AND 25 KNOTS. THE EVENING SOUNDING AT 
KEY WEST SHOWED NORTHEASTERLY 35 KNOT WINDS AT FL010. THE CHANGE IN 
WIND SPEED FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH FL020 IS CLOSE TO LOW LEVEL WIND 
SHEAR CRITERIA... AND PILOTS SHOULD BE ALERT TO WINDS INCREASING 15 
TO 20 KNOTS FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH FL020. AREAS OF VFR CEILINGS 
AROUND FL070 WILL OCCUR ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI AVIATION ROUTE 
AND THE ISLAND TERMINALS OF KEY WEST AND MARATHON. LIGHT SHOWERS 
ALONG THE ROUTE ARE POSSIBLE BUT NOT PROBABLE...AND SHOULD BE VERY 
BRIEF IN NATURE. OTHERWISE...NO OBSTRUCTIONS TO VISIBILITY ARE 
EXPECTED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
STRONG TO NEAR GALE BREEZES FROM THE NORTHEAST HAVE BEEN BLOWING FOR
SEVERAL HOURS NOW ALONG THE FLORIDA REEFS AND OUT OVER THE STRAITS OF
FLORIDA. THESE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH MOST OF
TONIGHT...BEFORE BREEZES BEGIN TO VERY GRADUALLY SLACKEN SUNDAY
THROUGH TUESDAY. 

THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN FAST AND PROGRESSIVE
THIS WEEK...WITH NO MAJOR SYNOPTIC DISTURBANCES AFFECTING THE KEYS. A
SPRAWLING LATE AUTUMN SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL GOVERN THE
WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH MID WEEK...WITH GRADUAL AIR MASS MODIFICATION
PROCEEDING IN THE LAYER OF AIR NEAR THE SURFACE THROUGHOUT THE
SERVICE AREA. THIS MEANS A SLOW AND GRADUAL WARMING AND MOISTENING
FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. CLOUD COVER WILL REMAIN HIGH TONIGHT...BUT
SHOULD START DECREASING SUNDAY. RAIN CHANCES WILL GO UP SLIGHTLY BY
MID WEEK AS THE ATMOSPHERE MOISTENS AND STARTS TO BECOME MORE
FAVORABLE FOR SHOWER FORMATION. THE NEXT COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO
MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH SOME COOLING FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.
THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST BEYOND WEDNESDAY...BUT NOT
AS MUCH AS USUAL THIS TIME OF YEAR.

GUSTS NEAR 35KT ALONG THE FLORIDA REEFS AND OVER THE STRAITS OF
FLORIDA. SEAS ARE APPROACHING FULLY DEVELOPED LEVELS IN THE STRAITS
OF FLORIDA...WITH SHIP REPORTS INDICATING SEAS IN THE GULF STREAM AS
HIGH AS 15-20FT. SEAS ARE STILL BUILDING IN HAWK CHANNEL...INSIDE
THE REEF...AS WINDS SLOWLY VEER. SHOWERS REMAIN GENERALLY BEYOND 20
NAUTICAL MILES SOUTH OF THE ISLANDS.

WINDS WILL LIKELY STAY NEAR OR IN EXCESS OF 20KT THROUGH AT LEAST
MONDAY...AND PROBABLY MOST OF TUESDAY. THEREAFTER...WINDS ARE LIKELY
TO SLACKEN WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING WEAK
COLD FRONT. HOWEVER...RESIDUAL SEAS WILL SURELY TAKE SOME TIME TO

A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WITH CENTRAL MSL PRESSURE OF 1037MB
OVER SOUTH CAROLINA HAS MOVED EAST DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS...
MAINTAINING A STRONG MSL PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND
STRAITS OF FLORIDA. THE JACKSONVILLE-GRAND CAYMAN MSL PRESSURE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
400 AM EST SAT DEC 9 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700 TO 200 MB)...AS OF 100 
AM...AT THE 500 MB LEVEL...UPPER AIR ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE 
MAIN AXIS OF A SHARP TROUGH EXTENDS FROM EAST OF NEW ENGLAND TO OFF 
THE GEORGIA COAST. IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWING THIS NARROW THROUGH IS A 
WEAKER SHORTWAVE TROUGH WITH ITS AXIS OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. A 
STRENGTHENING SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE JETSTREAM IS ALSO ILLUSTRATED 
BY A 85 TO 100 KNOT WINDS AT THE 250 MB LEVEL EXTENDING FROM OLD 
MEXICO EASTWARD ACROSS THE GULF AND NOW SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 100 AM...THE 
1038 MB CENTER OF A STRONG ANTICYCLONE OF ARCTIC ORIGINS CONTINUES 
TO SHIFT EASTWARD AND IS CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY. THE PRESENT AIR MASS TRAJECTORY HAS ALLOWED FOR SIGNIFICANT 
POLAR AIRMASS MODIFICATION OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTH FLORIDA SUCH THAT 
TEMPERATURES OVER THE KEYS STILL REMAIN IN THE MIDDLE 60S WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S. IN OTHER WORDS...1000-850 MB COLD THICKNESS 
ADVECTION HAS SEIZED.

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 AM...TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE KEYS ISLAND 
CHAIN ARE PRESENTLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND 
AND ADJOINING WATERS ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY. C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE 
FLORIDA REEF AND IN FLORIDA BAY ARE PRESENTLY REGISTERING 10 METER 
WINDS FROM NORTH NORTHEAST TO NORTHEAST...OR BETWEEN 020 AND 030 
DEGREES WITH A MAGNITUDE OF 21 TO 27 KNOTS...AND ISOLATED GUSTS TO 
NEAR GALE FORCE...OR 32 KNOTS AT MOLASSES REEF. KEY WEST RADAR IS 
DEPICTING ISOLATED SHOWERS MOVING ACROSS THE FLORIDA STRAITS. ONE OR 
TWO SHOWERS HAS PASSED OVER THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS SO FAR THIS 
MORNING...BUT THESE HAVE LIKELY ON DEPOSITED NON-MEASURABLE RAINFALL.

.FORECASTS...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(700 TO 200 MB)...
TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...PROGRESSIVE UPPER PATTERN WILL 
CONTINUE...WHICH WILL RAPIDLY MODERATE THE AIRMASS TEMPERATURE OVER 
THE CONUS. THE AFOREMENTIONED SHARP AND NARROW FAST MOVING TROUGHS 
WILL EXIT THE EASTERN SEABOARD BY SUNDAY MORNING...FOLLOWED BY A 
QUICK MOVING SHORTWAVE RIDGE PASSING BY FLORIDA LONGITUDE ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT. A SPLIT FLOW UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL REMAINS IN TACT OVER THE 
KEYS THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...WITH A NOTICEABLE SOUTHERN BRANCH OF THE 
JET CONTINUING OVER MEXICO...THE GULF...AND THE KEYS.

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
WILL ATTEMPT TO CARVE INTO A LOWER AMPLITUDE TROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT 
BEFORE FLATTENING OUT ON WEDNESDAY...SO QUIET WEATHER SHOULD 
CONTINUE OVER THE KEYS. ONLY IMPACT OF THE RATHER SO FAR INACTIVE 
SOUTHERN JET WILL BE JUST SOME CIRRUS TRANSPORTED OVERHEAD FOR THE 
LATTER PART OF NEXT WEEK. 

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS (SURFACE TO 700 MB)...THE 00Z NAM SEEMS 
TO HAVE THE SIGNIFICANTLY BETTER INITIALIZED THE 06Z POSITION AND 
MAGNITUDE OF THE CENTER OF THE ANTICYCLONE...WITH THE GFS ABOUT 4 
MBS TOO LOW. THE CENTER OF THIS STRONG ANTICYCLONE SHOULD SLIDE 
EASTWARD OFF THE CAROLINA COAST ON SUNDAY NIGHT AT ABOUT 1030 
MB...AND THEN ELONGATE INTO A NEAR 1030 MB RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. THE GFS ALSO INDICATES THE 
CENTER MOVING OFF THE COAST ON MONDAY...BUT HOLDS A 1030 MB CENTER 
FARTHER NORTH OVER NEW ENGLAND ON TUESDAY. 

TODAY AND TONIGHT...THE 00Z GFS MODEL SOUNDINGS AND TIME-HEIGHT 
FORECASTS FOR MARATHON AND KEY WEST STILL SHOW A VERY MOIST BOUNDARY 
LAYER FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 850 MB...WITH SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT 
BETWEEN 850 AND 700 MB THROUGH TONIGHT. THIS MAY BE A CONTRIBUTION 
TO THE HIGHER ADVERTISED MOS 12 HOUR POP#S OUTPUT...BUT DO NOT 
UNDERSTAND 
#S IN THE CHANCE TO GOOD CHANCE CATEGORY FOR ISOLATED NONMEASURABLE 
SHOWERS...SO 40 TO 55% APPEARS TO BE OVERDONE. MOST OF THE HEAVIER 
SHOWERS SHOULD REMAIN OFFSHORE OF THE KEYS...WITH JUST BRIEF LIGHT 
SHOWERS POSSIBLE OVER THE ISLANDS. THE BIG STORY WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
THE WINDY CONDITIONS...AND THE NAM MOS#S CONTINUE TO INDICATE WINDS 
BETWEEN 20 AND 25 KNOTS TODAY AND NEAR 20 KNOTS TONIGHT FOR THE 
KEYS. NO CHANGES TO THESE PERIODS.

SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AS THE MAIN ANTICYCLONE MOVES OFF THE 
CAROLINA COAST...WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY CLOCK FROM MAINLY 
NORTHEAST TO BETWEEN NORTHEAST AND EAST. WINDY OR BREEZY CONDITIONS 
ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE SUNDAY AND BREEZY ON MONDAY...ALONG WITH A 
CONTINUED MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES REACHING INTO THE MID 70S ON 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON...AND UPPER 70S ON MONDAY. RAIN CHANCES WILL REMAIN 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...NEAR 20 PERCENT...DUE FRESH TO STRONG FLOW 
CONTINUING OVER A RATHER MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER. 

EXTENDED FORECAST...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...ANOTHER WEAKER COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GULF STATES ON TUESDAY...HALTING OVER 
NORTH FLORIDA. AS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE CONTINUES TO BREAK 
DOWN...WEAKER RIDGING WILL REMAIN IN PLACE FROM THE BAHAMAS TO 
ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA. EXPECT SURFACE WINDS TO DIMINISH A BIT...AS 
TEMPERATURES RISE ABOVE THE AVERAGE MAXIMA AND MINIMA FOR MID 
DECEMBER. 12 HOUR RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
NORMAL...AND WILL HOLD AT 20 PERCENT.

RECEIVED ANY SHIP REPORTS BETWEEN THE FLORIDA REEF AND THE GULF 
STREAM. NEVERTHELESS...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS WILL BE 
LIKELY ON ALL WATERS THROUGH AT LEAST MONDAY...POSSIBLY CONTINUING 
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS THROUGH TUESDAY. AS WINDS VEER STRAIGHT 
OUT OF DUE NORTHEAST DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS...SEAS WILL BUILD 
INSIDE THE REEF...ESPECIALLY ADJACENT TO THE UPPER KEYS WHERE FETCH 
IS MOST FAVORABLE. SEAS EXCEEDING 10 TO 11 FEET ARE POSSIBLE STILL 
OUTSIDE OF THE GULF STREAM...BUT ARE MOST LIKELY WITHIN THE GULF 
STREAM...WITH STEEP WAVE HEIGHTS...ESPECIALLY OFFSHORE THE UPPER

.DISCUSSION...
A STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT EXISTS FROM NORTH FLORIDA ALL THE WAY 
DOWN TO THE CARIBBEAN SEA. STRONG NORTH TO NORTHEAST BREEZES ARE IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE ENTIRE SERVICE AREA THIS EVENING...WITH SEVERAL 
GUSTS NEAR GALE FORCE AT THE MORE ELEVATED CMAN STATIONS OVER THE 
PAST FEW HOURS. IR SATELLITE IMAGES THIS EVENING INDICATED PLENTY OF 
LAYERED CLOUDS OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS...AND TEMPERATURES 
HAVE NOT MOVED MUCH...IF AT ALL AT SOME LOCATIONS...THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS ACROSS THE ISLAND CHAIN. KBYX HAS SHOWN 
A RAGGED LINE/AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS PERSISTING IN THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS...AND ONLY A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS/SPRINKLES HAVE BEEN 
OBSERVED ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN THIS EVENING. OVERALL...THE

.DISCUSSION...
WINDS HAVE SURGED AS EXPECTED...WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIR SWEEPING
SOUTH ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS THIS MORNING.
CURRENTLY...MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES PREVAIL ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA. AIR
TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM 65-68F WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 50S. A
1043MB MODIFYING ARCTIC ANTICYCLONE WAS CENTERED OVER ARKANSAS THIS
MORNING WITH A STRONG MSL PRESSURE GRADIENT HAVING DEVELOPED OVER
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...KEYS...AND STRAITS OF FLORIDA. AT 13Z...THE
MSL PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN JACKSONVILLE AND GRAND CAYMAN WAS
14MB. LATEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW A BROKEN LINE OF SHOWERS FROM
20 NAUTICAL MILES SOUTHEAST OF KEY LARGO TO THE CAY SAL BANK...
EXTENDING ROUGHLY ALONG A COLD FRONT/WIND SURGE LINE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
300 AM EST FRI DEC 8 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700 TO 200 MB)...AS OF 200 
AM...THE MAIN AXIS OF A QUICK MOVING FULL LATITUDINAL 
TROUGH...ANALYZED AT 500 MB...PRESENTLY EXTENDS FROM THE CENTER OF A 
COLD CORE VORTEX OVER CENTRAL NEW YORK STATE SOUTHWEST TO LOUISIANA. 
THE FLORIDA KEYS ARE SITUATED NEAR THE BASE OF THIS LARGE SYNOPTIC 
SCALE TROUGH.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 200 AM...THE 
CENTER OF A 1045 MB HIGH PRESSURE...WITH ORIGINS FROM THE CANADIAN 
HIGH ARCTIC...IS NOW ANALYZED OVER NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA. THE RELATIVE 
POSITION OF THE CENTER OF THIS POLAR ANTICYCLONE IS RATHER FAR SOUTH 
FOR TIME OF YEAR. EAST AND SOUTH OF THIS MODIFIED POLAR AIRMASS...A 
SHARP COLD FRONT IS ANALYZED FROM THE GULF OF ST LAWRENCE SOUTHWARD 
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TO ACROSS THE EXTREME TIP OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA AND INTO THE NORTHERN YUCATAN PENINSULA. A SECOND COLD 
FRONT IS ANALYZED JUST OFF OF NEW ENGLAND TO ACROSS THE OUTER BANKS 
AND SOUTHWEST TO SOUTHERN GEORGIA. THE FLORIDA KEYS ARE NOW 
PRESENTLY BENEATH A RAPIDLY STRENGTHENING MAINLY NORTH FLOW WITHIN 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER NEAR THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. LATEST MSAS DATA 
REPRESENTATION OVER THE ENTIRE FLORIDA PENINSULA ILLUSTRATES THERE 
IS PRESENTLY A 10 MB PRESSURE DIFFERENCE AT THE SURFACE BETWEEN 
TALLAHASSEE AND KEY WEST. 

.CURRENTLY...LOW LEVEL SPEED CONVERGENCE OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS IS 
ALLOWING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME ISOLATED BUT HEAVY SHOWERS 
WITHIN 20 NM OFFSHORE OF THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS...VISIBLE PER KEY 
WEST RADAR. SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY OVER THE ISLANDS. TEMPERATURES  
ARE NEAR 70 DEGREES WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 60S. ON THE 
ISLANDS...THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS ARE REGISTERING BREEZY 
CONDITIONS WITH NORTH TO NORTH NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS RAPIDLY 
INCREASING TO BETWEEN 15 AND 20 KNOTS. C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE REEF 
AND FLORIDA BAY ARE REGISTERING 10 METER WINDS BETWEEN 16 AND 21 
KNOTS WITH GUSTS INTO MID 20S.

.FORECASTS...
.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...IN THE MID AND UPPER 
LEVELS...THE MAIN AXIS OF THE LARGE TROUGH WILL RAPIDLY EXIT THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD BY LATE TONIGHT. ANOTHER NARROWER SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
WILL IMMEDIATELY FOLLOW IT...SLIDING BY FLORIDA LONGITUDE ON 
SATURDAY...FOLLOWED BY A SHORTWAVE RIDGE FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.
  
.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...PROGRESSIVE UPPER PATTERN 
WILL CONTINUE ALLOWING FOR SLIGHT HEIGHT RISES OVER SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE A 
SPLIT FLOW PATTERN STILL APPEARS MOST PROBABLE OVER THE UNITED 
STATES TOWARDS THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO 
DEVELOP OVER NORTH TEXAS ON TUESDAY WITHIN AN INCREASING SOUTHERN 
BRANCH OF THE JETSTREAM. THIS ENERGY WILL TRANSLATE EAST AND 
NORTHWARD ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...KEEPING ASSOCIATED SYNOPTIC 
SCALE LIFT AND DYNAMICS WELL NORTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS...WHICH WILL 
REMAIN SOUTH OF A DEVELOPING INCREASINGLY ACTIVE SUBTROPICAL JET.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS(SURFACE TO 700 MB)
TODAY...THE COLD FRONT NOW TO OUR IMMEDIATE NORTH WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE KEYS BEFORE SUNRISE. THE SECOND ANALYZED COLD FRONT NOW OVER 
NORTH FLORIDA...WILL SLIDE SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE KEYS DURING THIS 
EVENING. LATEST 00Z MOS POP #S FOR THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS HAVE 
INCREASED TO BETWEEN 35 AND 45 PERCENT FOR THE PERIOD ENDING 00Z 
SATURDAY. THIS IS A BIT OF A DEVIATION FROM PRIOR RUNS. AN 
EXAMINATION OF THE ISENTROPICS DOES NOT RULE OUT A BRIEF PERIOD OF 
SHOWER ACTIVITY AHEAD OF THE NEXT FRONT...WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF 
THIS DURING THIS AFTERNOON. DECENT 1000-850 COLD THICKNESS ADVECTION 
IS STILL INDICATED THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...WITH VALUES DROPPING 
FROM NEAR 1390 DM AT THE PRESENT TIME TO ABOUT 1365 DM BY 12Z 
SATURDAY. AS A RESULT...TEMPERATURES WILL FALL THROUGH THE 60S 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. MOSTLY CLOUDY AND WINDY CONDITIONS ARE INDICATED 
ACCOMPANIED BY ABUNDANT STRATO-CUMULUS SHIELD...AND POSSIBLY EVEN A 
PERIOD OF STRATUS LATER THIS AFTERNOON. THEREFORE...THE ONLY CHANGE 
TO ONGOING FORECAST IS TO RAISE UP POPS INTO THE LOW CHANCE CATEGORY 
FOR TODAY...IN ANTICIPATION OF A BRIEF PERIOD OF SHOWERS AHEAD OF 
THE NEXT FRONT.

TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...THE LARGE AND COLD ANTICYCLONE WILL 
MODERATE ONLY VERY SLOWLY...AS THE CENTER OF THIS AIRMASS TRANSLATES 
EASTWARD TO OVER THE CAROLINA PIEDMONT NEAR 1035 MB ON SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT. THE CENTER OF THE ANTICYCLONE WILL STILL HOLD 1030 
MB TO 1032 MB ON SUNDAY BEFORE MOVING OFF THE COAST ON SUNDAY NIGHT. 
WINDY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THIS TYPE 
OF GRADIENT OVER THE KEYS...AND BREEZY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. WITH FRESH TO STRONG NORTHEAST FLOW ACROSS THE 
WATERS...THERE WILL BE ABUNDANT PATCHES OF STRATOCUMULUS MOVING 
ACROSS THE ISLANDS AND ADJOINING WATERS TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. WILL 
MAINTAIN CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS OR MOSTLY WORDING FOR THESE TWO 
PERIODS. 12 HOUR POP #S ARE JUST ABOVE CLIMO THROUGH THIS PERIOD DUE 
TO PWAT NEAR 1.5 INCHES. ABUNDANT MOISTURE AVAILABLE IN THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER...AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE THROUGH THIS TIMEFRAME...WILL HOLD 
THE INHERITED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS.

EXTENDED FORECAST...THE 1030 PLUS MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTER WILL 
ELONGATE INTO A STRONG WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE. THIS WILL MAINTAIN 
BREEZY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS. 
DAILY MAXIMA AND MINIMA TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONAL 
AVERAGES...ACCOMPANIED BY SLIGHT RAIN CHANCES.

...STRONG BREEZES EXPECTED FOR NEXT FEW DAYS...

.DISCUSSION...
ISOLATED AND SLOW MOVING ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR HAVE BEEN PERSISTENT 
BEYOND THE WESTERN EXTREME OF THE SERVICE AREA THIS EVENING. EVEN 
MORE ISOLATED RETURNS HAVE RECENTLY BLOSSOMED OVER EXTREME SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND VERY NEAR THE UPPER KEYS. OTHERWISE...ELEVATED CLOUDS 
CONTINUE TO ADVECT ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE SERVICE AREA FROM 
THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ISLAND 
CHAIN ARE CURRENTLY IN THE MID 70S WITH LIGHT TO GENTLE NORTH 
BREEZES.

FORECAST REASONING HAS NOT CHANGED SINCE THIS AFTERNOON. A COLD 
FRONT WILL BE PUSHING ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS LATER IN THE 
OVERNIGHT PERIOD. BREEZES WILL PICK UP ON THE BACK SIDE OF THIS 
FRONT...AND TIMING AMONG THE MODELS IS IN TIGHT AGREEMENT WITH WINDY 
CONDITIONS EXPECTED ALL LOCATIONS BY DAYBREAK. AN UPDATE TO THE ZONE 
FORECAST WILL BE SENT SHORTLY JUST TO ADJUST SOME TRANSITIONAL 
WORDING. OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 60S AND RAIN CHANCES OF 
20 PERCENT WILL NOT BE ADJUSTED.

.MARINE...SAME RATIONALE. THE LATE EVENING MARINE UPDATE WILL 
TAKE INTO ACOUNT THE LATEST OBSERVATIONS AND A TRANSITION INTO FRESH 
TO POTENTIALLY STRONG BREEZES BY EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. A SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR ALL MARINE ZONES...AND WILL PERSIST ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH THIS WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THIS EVENING ALONG THE 
KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. 
ANYTIME AFTER 06Z WE SHOULD EXPECT THE WINDS TO INCREASE AND THE 
CLOUD FRACTION TO INCREASE. BY 12Z NORTH WINDS TO 20 KTS WILL CREATE 
TRICKY CROSSWINDS ON OUR EAST-WEST RUNWAYS...PLEASE USE EXTRA 
CAUTION.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
GOES-12 IR IMAGERY SHOWS A WEAK UPPER LEVEL IMPULSE STREAMING 
EASTWARD THROUGH THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...WITH A DEEPENING 
LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES. SURFACE ANALYSIS 
DEPICTS A WEAKENING WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OFFSHORE OF THE SOUTHEAST 
UNITED STATES COAST...WITH COLD FRONTOGENESIS TAKING SHAPE OVER THE 
EASTERN GREAT LAKES INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. ACROSS THE 
MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE NORTHEAST TO EAST 
WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS...WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING ONLY A 
FEW SPRINKLES OVER THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE 
LOWER KEYS. 

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
A WEAKENING WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OFFSHORE OF THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES COAST WILL RETREAT FURTHER EASTWARD...AS A STRENGTHENING COLD 
FRONT DROPS DOWN INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA AND THE ADJACENT GULF AND 
ATLANTIC WATERS LATE TODAY. THEREFORE...A WEAKENING AND BACKING WIND 
PROFILE SHOULD ENSURE DRY CONDITIONS ALONG WITH SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH EARLY TONIGHT. THEREAFTER...THE STRONG 
COLD FRONT WILL DRIVE DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND PASS THROUGH 
THE FLORIDA KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. 
DESPITE NO MID AND UPPER LEVEL LIFT...SPEED CONVERGENCE COMBINED 
WITH MOISTURE FLUX WILL PROMPT 20 PERCENT POPS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
COLD FRONT. IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT...A STRONG POLAR ANTICYCLONE 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST 
UNITED STATES RESULTING IN STRONG WINDS THROUGH SATURDAY.  

TEMPERATURE WISE...SIGNIFICANT COLD THICKNESS ADVECTION WILL
ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO FALL INTO THE MID 60S FRIDAY MORNING...WITH 
TEMPERATURES STRUGGLING TO REACH 70 DEGREES BEFORE STEADY AND SLOWLY 
FALLING TEMPERATURES FOLLOW FRIDAY AFTERNOON. ADDITIONAL COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO FALL INTO THE MID TO UPPER 50S 
IN THE UPPER KEYS...TO NEAR 60 IN THE LOWER KEYS SATURDAY MORNING. 
TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY MODERATE INTO THE LOWER 70S SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AS WINDS TURN TO NORTHEAST.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
A COMPLEX...PROGRESSIVE MID AND UPPER LEVEL SPLIT FLOW PATTERN WILL 
TAKE HOLD OVER THE CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES WELL INTO NEXT WEEK. 
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES ALOFT...THE CENTER OF A LARGE POLAR 
ANTICYCLONE IN ORIGIN WILL SLOWLY MODIFY...AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE 
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES AND INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC MONDAY. 
ALTHOUGH THE CORE OF THE ANTICYCLONE WILL SLIDE FURTHER OFFSHORE 
INTO THE ATLANTIC...A LENGTHY RIDGE WILL REACH BACK ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST STATES AND FLORIDA PENINSULA THROUGH TUESDAY. THE RIDGE 
WILL SLIP OFFSHORE OF THE FLORIDA EAST COAST...AS A TROUGH MOVES 
DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. WITH A DEEPENING EASTERLY FLOW...LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL SLOWLY INCREASE. HOWEVER...WITH 
THE ABSENCE OF MID AND UPPER LEVEL ASCENT AND NO LOW LEVEL 
CONFLUENCE BOUNDARY NEARBY...ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE 
MAINTAINED THROUGH THE PERIOD. OTHERWISE...WITHIN A EASTERLY 
FLOW...TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE QUICKLY TO ABOVE NORMAL BY MONDAY. 

&&

.MARINE...
AFTER A BRIEF SPELL OF GENTLE TO MODERATE WINDS THROUGH EARLY 
TONIGHT...MARINERS SHOULD BE COGNIZANT THAT A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL 
PUSH THROUGH ALL KEYS WATERS BY EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. BEHIND THIS 
COLD FRONT...STRONG NORTHERLY WINDS WILL OVERSPREAD ALL KEYS WATERS. 
IN FACT...STRONG NORTHEAST WINDS WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. SUBSEQUENTLY...A SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY WILL BE REQUIRED. 
 
&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB 
ROUTE AND AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. EXPECT TWO DECKS OF 
CLOUDS...WITH BASES OF STRATO-CU DECKS AT 3000 TO 5000 FEET AND 
ALTOCUMULUS AT ABOUT 8000 FEET. BRIEF MVFR CEILINGS AROUND 2000 FEET 
ARE POSSIBLE EARLY ACROSS THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE THROUGH

930 PM EST WED DEC 6 2006

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST CONTINUES TO PULL OFF INTO THE 
ATLANTIC. WINDS HAVE SHOWN A DOWNWARD TREND AT JUST ABOUT EVERY 
OBSERVATION POINT IN THE SERVICE AREA OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. 
READINGS ARE AVERAGING VERY NEAR 15 KNOTS AT THE CMANS AND JUST 
ABOVE 10 MPH ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN. INFREQUENT GUSTS NEAR 20 KNOTS 
ARE STILL LIKELY OUT IN THE STRAITS BUT ANALYSIS SHOWS THE GRADIENT 
LOOSENING ACROSS ALL AREAS. KBYX RADAR HAS THE SMALLEST OF ECHOES 
MOVING SOUTHWESTWARD IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT TO THE LOWER 
KEYS AND JUST A FEW FLIRTING WITH THE MIDDLE KEYS. THESE CAN NOT BE 
MUCH MORE THAN BRIEF SPRINKLES IF THEY ARE EVEN REACHING THE 
SURFACE. OTHERWISE...A THICKER DECK OF CLOUDS BASED AOA 8 KFT IS 
ADVANCING EASTWARD FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO AND SHOULD KEEP THE KEYS 
UNDER A FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUDS THROUGH THE BULK OF THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD.

.FORECAST...
THE WEAK RETURNS ON RADAR THAT ARE CLOSE TO THE ISLANDS ARE NOT 
ENOUGH OF A THREAT TO INCLUDE A POP OVERNIGHT...BUT WILL MONITOR 
THIS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT A SLIGHTLY 
DRIER AREA ON THE WEAKENING NORTHEAST/EAST FLOW UPSTREAM SHOULD 
DIMINISH EVEN THE SMALL THREAT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS. I WILL 
SEND A LATE EVENING ZONE UPDATE THOUGH TO ELIMINATE THE WIND 
TRANSITION FROM THE AFTERNOON ISSUANCE. EXPECT WIND SPEEDS AROUND 10 
MPH ALONG THE ISLANDS OVERNIGHT...AND LOWS NEAR 70.

.MARINE...
WITH THE DOWNWARD TREND ON THE WIND SPEEDS ALREADY EVIDENT ACROSS 
THE SERVICE AREA...WILL GO AHEAD AND DROP THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY 
IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS ON THIS LATE EVENING MARINE UPDATE. THE LOWER 
CONDITIONS WILL BE SHORT-LIVED THOUGH...BECAUSE BY THURSDAY NIGHT WE 
WILL SEE THE ONSET OF WHAT SHOULD BE AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS 
AROUND FL030...AND VFR CEILINGS AROUND FL090...WILL OCCUR. SKIES 
SHOULD BE CLEAR ABOVE FL100.

===================================================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A BROAD AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS LOCATED OFF THE NORTHEAST U.S. 
COAST...MOVING NORTHEASTWARD. WINDS ACROSS OUR AREA HAVE DROPPED 
JUST A BIT...TO 10 TO 15 MPH ON LAND...NEAR 15 KNOTS ON FLORIDA 
BAY...15 TO 20 KNOTS ON THE GULF...AND NEAR 20 KNOTS AND GUSTY ON 
THE ATLANTIC WATERS...ESPECIALLY BEYOND THE REEF. SKIES ARE PARTLY 
CLOUDY WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR 80 AND DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S. KBYX 
DETECTS A FEW SPRINKLES IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS...OTHERWISE NO ECHOES 
IN OUR AREA.

.FORECAST...
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
MOVE RAPIDLY ACROSS EASTERN CANADA...PUSHING THE AFOREMENTIONED AREA 
OF HIGH PRESSURE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE U.S. COAST. THIS WILL RESULT 
IN A LIGHTENING OF OUR WINDS...BEGINNING TONIGHT AND CONTINUING INTO 
TOMORROW. THERE HAVE BEEN NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES NEAR THE KEYS 
TODAY...AND WITH WIND SPEEDS DROPPING OFF AND NO DETECTABLE SOURCE 
OF LIFT ENTERING THE AREA...HAVE REMOVED POPS TONIGHT. TOMORROW 
SHOULD BE A PLEASANT DAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES NEAR 80 AND LIGHT 
WINDS UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...A STRONG COLD FRONT TRAILING FROM 
THE LOW OVER EASTERN CANADA WILL SWEEP DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA ON 
THURSDAY AND PASS THROUGH THE KEYS THURSDAY NIGHT...PROBABLY AROUND 
OR AFTER MIDNIGHT. BEHIND THE FRONT...WINDS WILL RAPIDLY INCREASE TO 
NEAR 20 KNOTS OR SO ON ALL KEYS WATERS BY FRIDAY MORNING. IT DOES 
NOT APPEAR THAT THERE ARE SUFFICIENT MID/UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS OR 
LIFTING MECHANISMS TO SUPPORT CHANCE POPS AT THIS TIME...HOWEVER 
SPEED CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT COMBINED WITH DECENT LOW-LEVEL 
MOISTURE JUSTIFIES SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.

IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT...A LARGE STRONG AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT SOUTH OF 
THIS HIGH PRESSURE WILL RESULT IN STRONG GENERALLY NORTHEASTERLY 
WINDS ACROSS KEYS WATERS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY 
WILL BE REQUIRED FOR KEYS WATERS FROM FRIDAY...PROBABLY THROUGH AT 
LEAST SUNDAY. THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW COLD TEMPERATURES 
WILL DROP BEHIND THE FRONT...BUT INDICATIONS ARE THAT LOWS BELOW 60 
ARE UNLIKELY ON SATURDAY MORNING...EXCEPT POSSIBLY IN UPPER KEYS 
LOCATIONS IF MAINLAND DRAINAGE EFFECTS ARE OPTIMIZED. FRIDAY WILL 
SURELY FEEL CHILLY TO KEYS RESIDENTS...WITH TEMPERATURES STRUGGLING 
TO REACH 70 IN A STIFF NORTH NORTHEASTERLY BREEZE.

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THE AFOREMENTIONED LARGE HIGH 
PRESSURE AREA WILL BEGIN TO MOVE OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST LATE 
SUNDAY...RESULTING IN A VERY GRADUAL SLACKENING OF WINDS ACROSS OUR 
AREA. HOWEVER...EAST NORTHEASTERLY BREEZES WILL REMAIN STRONG ENOUGH 
THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR SEAS TO SUBSIDE EARLY IN THE WEEK. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD REBOUND QUICKLY BEGINNING SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH 
HIGHS ALREADY IN THE UPPER 70S BY SUNDAY...THUS THE COLD SPELL 
BEHIND THE FRONT WILL BE SHORT-LIVED EVEN THOUGH THE STRONG WINDS 
WILL PERSIST FOR A WHILE.

&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR THE ATLANTIC WATERS FOR 
RESIDUAL SEAS. FRESH EAST NORTHEASTERLY BREEZES WILL SLACKEN 
TONIGHT...BECOMING GENTLE TO MODERATE BY TOMORROW MORNING. HIGH 
RESIDUAL SEAS WILL ALSO SUBSIDE OVERNIGHT. A COLD FRONT ACCOMPANIED 
BY STRONG NORTH WINDS WILL PASS THROUGH THE KEYS EARLY FRIDAY 
MORNING...WITH STRONG GENERALLY NORTHEASTERLY WINDS THEN PERSISTING 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL BE NECESSARY ON ALL 
KEYS WATERS FROM FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THIS EVENING ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS 
AROUND FL030...AND VFR CEILINGS AROUND FL090...WILL OCCUR. NORTHEAST 
WINDS WILL CONTINUE NEAR 10 KNOTS. WINDS OFF THE DECK THROUGH FL050 
WILL BE MAINLY EAST BETWEEN 10 AND 20 KNOTS. SKIES SHOULD BE CLEAR 
ABOVE FL100.

1000 AM EST WED DEC 6 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A SURFACE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE...PRIMARILY RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR 
RECENT FRESH TO STRONG WINDS...IS MOVING EASTWARD OFF THE 
MID-ATLANTIC COAST. WHILE WINDS ARE STILL NEAR 15 MPH AND GUSTY 
AROUND THE LOWER KEYS...AND 20 KT AND GUSTY ON THE SURROUNDING 
WATERS...THEY HAVE BEGUN TO SLACKEN OVER THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 
KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS...TO NEAR 15 KT AND GUSTY ON THE WATER 
AND 10 TO 15 MPH ON LAND. MEANWHILE...PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES PREVAIL 
OVER THE ISLANDS...BUT WITH STRATOCUMULUS LURKING OVER THE STRAITS 
AND A HIGHER ALTOCUMULUS DECK ATTEMPTING TO FORM OVER THE GULF 
WATERS AROUND THE LOWER KEYS. TEMPERATURES ARE RISING INTO THE MID 
70S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S. KBYX RADAR DETECTS A FEW 
SHOWERS OVER THE OUTER STRAITS WELL SOUTH OF THE MIDDLE AND LOWER 
KEYS AND DRY TORTUGAS...WITH NO ECHOES ELSEWHERE.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (THIS AFTERNOON)...
AS THE SURFACE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE MOVES AWAY OFF THE COAST OF 
VIRGINIA...WINDS WILL SLACKEN OVER THE LOWER KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS...AS THEY ALREADY HAVE AROUND THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS. BY 
LATE AFTERNOON WINDS SHOULD BE 10 TO 15 MPH ON LAND...10 TO 15 KT IN 
THE BAY...AND NEAR 15 KT ON THE GULF AND ATLANTIC WATERS...THEN 
DECREASING FURTHER TONIGHT. MEANWHILE...THE 12Z KEY WEST RAOB 
INDICATES GOOD MOISTURE BELOW AN INVERSION BASED AROUND 9000 FT 
AGL...WITH DRY AIR ABOVE. HOWEVER...RIDGING AND SUBSIDENCE APPEAR TO 
BE SQUELCHING ANY CONVECTION...AND AS WINDS SLACKEN AND DRY AIR 
MIXES DOWN THE CHANCES OF RAIN SHOULD DIMINISH EVEN FURTHER THIS 
AFTERNOON. THEREFORE...HAVE UPDATED LOCAL FORECAST TO REMOVE POPS 
FOR THE REST OF TODAY.

&&

.MARINE...
FRESH TO STRONG NORTHEAST WINDS AROUND THE LOWER KEYS AND DRY 
TORTUGAS THIS MORNING WILL SLACKEN BY AFTERNOON...AS THEY ALREADY 
HAVE OVER THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS WATERS. GENTLE TO MODERATE WINDS 
WILL DECREASE FURTHER LATER TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. A COLD FRONT 
ACCOMPANIED BY STRONG NORTH WINDS WILL PASS THROUGH THE KEYS EARLY 
FRIDAY MORNING...WHICH WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. A SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY WILL BE NECESSARY ON ALL KEYS WATERS FROM FRIDAY 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE MARINE FORECAST PACKAGE HANDLES THIS 
SCENARIO WELL. WHILE THE SCA WILL BE DROPPED FOR FLORIDA BAY AT THE 
MORNING UPDATE...IT WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE GULF AND ATLANTIC 
WATERS THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO RESIDUAL SEAS. NO CHANGES ARE EXPECTED 
BEYOND THE FIRST PERIOD OF THE MARINE FORECAST ON THE MORNING UPDATE.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS 
AROUND FL030 WILL OCCUR. NORTHEAST WINDS WILL CONTINUE THIS MORNING 
NEAR 15 KNOTS AND GUSTY...DROPPING TO BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS THIS 
AFTERNOON. WINDS OFF THE DECK THROUGH FL030 WILL BE MAINLY NORTHEAST 
TO EAST BETWEEN 15 AND 25 KNOTS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
GOES-12 IR IMAGERY SHOWS SEVERAL PATCHES OF CLOUDS OVER THE FLORIDA 
KEYS AND THE SURROUNDING WATERS. WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT APPEARS TO BE 
THE MAIN SOURCE OF THE CLOUDINESS TO OUR SOUTHWEST AND 
NORTHWEST...WHILE THE EXTENSIVE CLOUDINESS OVER THE EASTERN STRAITS 
AND BAHAMAS IS ASSOCIATED WITH A STATIONARY BOUNDARY. SURFACE 
ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WEAKENING AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE (1031 MB) 
CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC REGION...WITH A DEVELOPING COLD FRONT 
TAKING SHAPE OVER THE GREAT PLAINS REGION. THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN THE AFOREMENTIONED AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE AND THE STATIONARY 
FRONT IS RESULTING IN NORTHEAST WINDS OF AROUND 20 KNOTS...WITH 
GUSTS NEAR 25 KNOTS ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT. MEANWHILE...LOCAL 
RADARS ARE DETECTING ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS DROPPING WEST SOUTHWEST 
THROUGH THE OFFSHORE WATERS BEYOND 20 MILES SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. 

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A BROAD AND POSITIVELY TILTED MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES WILL DEEPEN AND AMPLIFY OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...AS A VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE DROPS OUT OF CANADA. 
BECAUSE OF THE SHARPENING AND DIGGING TROUGH...A STRONG COLD FRONT 
WILL DIVE DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA THURSDAY...AND PUSH THROUGH THE 
FLORIDA KEYS AND THE ADJACENT WATERS EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. ALTHOUGH 
THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE SUBTROPICAL JET AND MID AND UPPER 
LEVEL VORTICITY ADVECTION WILL REMAIN WELL NORTH OF OUR AREA...THE 
COMBINATION OF MOISTURE FLUX AND SPEED CONVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE COLD FRONT MAY GENERATE A NARROW SWATH OF SCATTERED SHOWERS LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. IN WAKE OF THE COLD 
FRONT...A LARGE AND STRONG POLAR ANTICYCLONE WILL DROP INTO THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH A RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES AND FLORIDA PENINSULA. STRONG COLD THICKNESS ADVECTION IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH A TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL PROMOTE 
SIGNIFICANT VERTICAL MIXING RESULTING IN MOSTLY CLOUDY AND BLUSTERY 
CONDITIONS FRIDAY. THEREFORE...TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH 
70 DEGREES IN THE MORNING...BEFORE STEADY AND SLOWLY FALLING 
TEMPERATURES PREVAIL IN THE AFTERNOON. UNTIL THEN...ENOUGH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE AND CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY UNDERNEATH A MID LEVEL 
INVERSION WILL PROMPT ISOLATED SHOWERS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 
OTHERWISE...SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL PERSIST UNTIL 
THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
WITH A PROGRESSIVE MID AND UPPER LEVEL FLOW...THE POLAR TROUGH WILL 
LIFT OFFSHORE OF THE EASTERN SEABOARD. IN WAKE OF THE DEPARTING 
TROUGH...A COMPLEX SPLIT FLOW PATTERN WILL SET UP OVER THE 
CONTIGUOUS UNITED STATES WITH A LARGE ANTICYCLONE DOMINATING THE 
EASTERN UNITED STATES AND FLORIDA PENINSULA INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
BECAUSE OF THE QUICK CHANGES ALOFT...A MODIFYING POLAR ANTICYCLONE 
OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL SHIFT QUICKLY INTO THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC...WITH A RIDGE REACHING ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA 
THROUGH TUESDAY. SUBSEQUENTLY...WITH WINDS VEERING TO EASTERLY 
BEGINNING SATURDAY NIGHT...A BRIEF SPELL OF WELL BELOW NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES WILL QUICKLY RETURN TO ABOVE NORMAL BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
FURTHERMORE...WITHIN THE DEEPENING EASTERLY FLOW...FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS REVEAL PWAT VALUES ABOVE 1.5 INCHES BY LATE SUNDAY...AND 
PERSISTING THEREAFTER. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE DEEP ANTICYCLONIC 
FLOW...WILL MAINTAIN ONLY 20 PERCENT POPS FOR NOW. 

&&

.MARINE...
FRESH TO STRONG WINDS WILL SLACKEN BY AFTERNOON...AND GENTLE TO 
MODERATE NORTHEAST WINDS WILL DECREASE LATER TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. 
BEYOND THAT...A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MOVE DOWN THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA AND THROUGH THE FLORIDA KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS EARLY 
FRIDAY MORNING...FOLLOWED BY STRONG NORTH WINDS. STRONG WINDS WILL 
PERSIST THROUGH THIS WEEKEND. HENCE...A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL BE 
NECESSARY ON ALL KEYS WATERS FRIDAY THROUGH THIS WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...
LOWER LEVELS HAVE CONTINUED TO VEER AND A EAST TO NORTHEAST FLOW NOW 
EXTENDS TO ROUGHLY 8 KFT. IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A PERSITENT FETCH 
OF BROKEN CLOUDS EXTENDING NEAR AND ALONG THE EASTERN REACHES OF THE 
ISLAND CHAIN LATE THIS EVENING. A NARROW BREAK IS EVIDENT OFF TO THE 
NORTHWEST AND THEN ANOTHER PERISTENT ELEVATED DECK OF CLOUDS REACHES 
FROM THE EASTERN GULF TOWARDS THE SOUTHWESTERN COUNTIES OF THE 
MAINLAND. PLENTY OF CHAFF ON KBYX RADAR THIS EVENING...BUT REAL 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES HAVE BEEN ISOLATED OVER THE STRAITS...WITH A 
LARGER BLOB OF MODERATE SHOWERS SKIRTING THE MIDDLE KEYS ON THE 
ATLANTIC SIDE. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT HAS PINCHED OVER THE PAST FEW 
HOURS...ENOUGH TO FRESHEN WINDS AGAIN TO AN AVERAGE OF 20 KNOTS OR 
MORE AT THE REPORTING CMANS. TEMPERATURES ARE STILL IN THE MID 70S 
ALONG THE ISLANDS.

.FORECAST...
CURRENT CONDITIONS FORCE A FEW MINOR CHANGES TO THE AFTERNOON 
FORECASTS...MOSTLY A MARINE CONCERN.

FOR THE ISLANDS...ALTHOUGH A STRETCH OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS 
ARE MORE SUSCEPTIBLE TO LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS IN THE IMMEDIATE 
TERM...SHOWERS FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD SHOULD REMAIN OUT OVER THE 
STRAITS. I WILL BE SENDING AN UPDATE TO THE ZONES TO BRING THE RAIN 
CHANCE DOWN TO A SLIGHT CHANCE. KMTH HAS RECENTLY SHOWN THE ABILITY 
FOR WIND GUSTS AOA 20 KNOTS ALONG THE ISLANDS OVERNIGHT...SOMETHING 
THAT IS UNIFORMLY INDICATED BY THE SHORT TERM GRAPHICAL AND NUMERIC 
GUIDANCE.

FOR MARINE CONCERNS...DUE TO RECENT OBSERVATIONS...AND PINCHED 
GRADIENT ENCOMPASSING MUCH OF THE SERVICE AREA OVER THE PAST FEW 
HOURS...WILL NEED TO RAISE A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY. I WAS INITIALLY 
GOING TO CONFINE THAT TO THE ATLANTIC MARINE ZONES...BUT MORE RECENT 
REPORTS FROM LONF1 AND ANALYSIS FURTHER TO THE NORTHWEST...WILL 
RAISE THAT HEADLINE FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD ALL ZONES. BOTH THE GFS 
AND NAM SHOW A PEAK SUSTAINED WINDSPEED A FEW HOURS BEFORE SUNRISE 
BEFORE SPEED DECLINE THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW. THE GRIDS WILL HAVE

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A BROAD PRESSURE RIDGE LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES IS DRIVING 
NEAR 10 TO 15 MPH WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS AND 15 TO 20 KNOTS AT MARINE 
LOCATIONS. A DYING COLD FRONT IS DRAPED ACROSS KEYS WATERS...WHILE 
ZONAL FLOW IS IN PLACE ALOFT. PATCHES OF STRATO CU CONTINUE TO 
AFFECT PORTIONS OF THE KEYS...CURRENTLY INCLUDING THE MIDDLE AND 
UPPER KEYS. THIS CLOUD COVER IS MAINLY STRATOCU WEDGED UNDER A 
COUPLE OF INVERSION/ISOTHERMAL LAYERS AT AROUND 10KFT AND BETWEEN 4 
AND 6 KFT. THE ONLY PRECIPITATION DETECTED BY DOPPLER RADAR IN OUR 
WATERS IS LOCATED OVER THE STRAITS...ALONG A PERSISTENT CLOUD LINE 
EMANATING OFF OF THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF FLORIDA. TEMPERATURES HAVE 
COME UP INTO THE MID 70S WITH DEW POINTS HOVERING IN THE MID 60S.

.FORECAST...
THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR LOCAL PRESSURE GRADIENT 
WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE RATHER QUICKLY EASTWARD OUT OVER THE NORTHWEST 
ATLANTIC BY TOMORROW. THE GRADIENT WILL REMAIN FAIRLY TIGHT 
OVERNIGHT...RELAXING TOMORROW AS WE MOVE INTO THE WESTERN PERIPHERY 
OF THE DEPARTING LOW. THIS RESULTS IN A VEERING LOW LEVEL WIND 
PROFILE IN AN ALREADY MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER. ALL THIS ON TOP OF A 
FAVORABLE WIND DIRECTION WILL MEAN AT LEAST A CHANCE OF PRECIP AND 
MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS. TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE OVER THE NEXT 
24 HOURS DUE TO THE QUICK RETURN OF THE EASTERLY FLOW.

LATER TOMORROW THROUGH THURSDAY...THE KEYS WILL BE NEAR A CULL 
BETWEEN THE ATLANTIC HIGH AND A NEW CONTINENTAL HIGH OVER THE 
SOUTHERN STATES...SEPARATED BY A SURFACE TROUGH. GUIDANCE LIFTS THIS 
TROUGH OUT NORTHEASTWARD BEFORE IT EVEN REACHES FLORIDA. 

A POWERFUL HIGH WILL ONCE CONSIDERABLY TIGHTEN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT 
BEGINNING THURSDAY NIGHT AND PUSH A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE KEYS 
AREA. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO NORTH TO NORTHEAST AND INCREASE TO 15 TO 
20 MPH. THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE ALONG THE INITIAL WIND 
SURGE. TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE MID 60S...AND 
HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S.

THROUGH THE WEEKEND...THE HIGH WILL STRETCH EASTWARD OUT OVER THE 
ATLANTIC...RESULTING IN WINDS BECOMING NORTHEAST TO EAST NORTHEAST 
BY SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS EXPECTED TO 
REMAIN TIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND INTO NEXT WEEK...ALLOWING 
TEMPERATURES TO GRADUALLY MODERATE. AT LEAST 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF 
RAIN WILL BE REQUIRED DUE TO THE INCREASED MOISTURE FLUX AND STRONG 
WINDS OVER ATLANTIC WATERS IN THE UPPER 70S.

&&

.MARINE...
A FAIRLY TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS KEYS WATERS WILL KEEP 15 TO 
20 KNOT NORTHEAST WINDS AND AN EXERCISE CAUTION ACROSS MOST KEYS 
WATERS. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT WINDS OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS MAY 
GET TO AROUND 20 KNOTS. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR TRENDS. A SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED BRIEFLY TONIGHT. WINDS WILL RELAX TO 
10 TO 15 KNOTS TOMORROW. THURSDAY NIGHT THE NEXT COLD FRONT AND 
ASSOCIATED FOLLOWING HIGH WILL TURN WINDS BACK TO NORTH TO NORTHEAST 
AND INCREASE TO AT LEAST 15 TO 20 KNOTS ACROSS KEYS WATERS. A SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED BEGINNING THURSDAY NIGHT...AND 
PERSISTING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

A BROAD RIDGE AXIS LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES IS DRIVING NEAR 
15 MPH WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS AND 15 TO 20 KNOTS AT MARINE LOCATIONS. 
A DYING COLD FRONT IS DRAPED ACROSS KEYS WATERS...WHILE ZONAL FLOW 
IS IN PLACE ALOFT. LARGE AREAS OF CLOUDS PERSISTING OVER THE KEYS 
AND SOUTH FLORIDA ARE BREAKING UP INTO PATCHES. ALMOST ALL OF THIS 
CLOUD COVER IS STRATOCU WEDGED UNDER A COUPLE OF 
INVERSION/ISOTHERMAL LAYERS AT AROUND 10KFT AND BETWEEN 4 AND 6 KFT. 
THE ONLY PRECIPITATION DETECTED BY DOPPLER RADAR IS LOCATED OVER THE 
OUTER STRAITS...ALONG A PERSISTENT CLOUD LINE EMANATING OFF OF THE 
SOUTHEAST COAST OF FLORIDA. TEMPERATURES DROPPED INTO THE UPPER 60S 
AND ARE CURRENTLY IN THE LOWER 70S WITH DEW POINTS IN THE LOWER 60S. 

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (THIS AFTERNOON)...
WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN AROUND 15 MPH...OUT OF THE NORTH TO 
NORTHEAST. NORTHEAST FLOW THROUGH THE LOWER TROP SHOULD KEEP DAYTIME 
HIGHS AROUND THE MID 70S AND HELP TO LIMIT PRECIPITATION CHANCES. A 
STILL MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER WITH MULTIPLE INVERSIONS WILL ASSIST IN 
KEEPING OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY IN THE FORECAST. NO CHANGES NECESSARY TO 
THE LOCAL FORECAST. 

&&

.MARINE...
A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS KEYS WATERS WILL KEEP 15 TO 20 KNOT 
WINDS AND AN EXERCISE CAUTION ACROSS MOST KEYS WATERS. A RECENT SHIP 
OBSERVATION FROM THE STRAITS SOUTH OF HALFMOON SHOAL LIGHT INDICATED 
20 KNOTS...AND A FAIRLY RECENT QUIKSCAT PASS INDICATED WINDS A 
LITTLE HIGHER OVER THE STRAITS OF ZONE 75. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY

CHAFF (FALSE ECHOES) OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND THE ADJACENT 
NEARSHORE WATERS. OTHERWISE...SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS THE 
TROUGH/SHEAR AXIS WHICH PASSED THROUGH THE FLORIDA KEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON HAS BECOME STATIONARY OVER THE OUTER STRAITS...WITH A 
LENGTHY AND MODIFIED POLAR ANTICYCLONE (1033 MB) OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
UNITED STATES. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS 
INDICATE NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS WITH GUSTS NEAR 
25 KNOTS.   

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A BROAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES WILL QUICKLY DEPART INTO THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC...LEAVING A ZONAL WESTERLY FLOW OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AND 
FLORIDA PENINSULA. BECAUSE OF THE ZONAL FLOW...A STATIONARY 
TROUGH/SHEAR AXIS OVER THE STRAITS WILL LINGER OR POSSIBLY BACK UP 
AS A WARM FRONT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. BEYOND 
WEDNESDAY...ANOTHER PROGRESSIVE MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
DEEPEN OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES. 
MEANWHILE...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES 
WILL WEAKEN AND SLIDE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY...AS A COLD FRONT PUSHES DOWN INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA BY LATE 
THURSDAY. 

PRECIPITATION WISE...WITH LOW LEVEL WINDS VEERING QUICKLY TO 
EASTERLY TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...MOISTURE WILL INCREASE BY LATE 
TODAY. GIVEN AMPLE MOISTURE AND THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE 
TROUGH/SHEAR AXIS...CHANGEABLE SKIES ALONG WITH A 20 TO 30 PERCENT

WEDNESDAY NIGHT. OTHERWISE...VEERING WINDS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES 
TO CLIMB SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL BEGINNING TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A DEEPENING MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED 
STATES WILL ALLOW A COLD FRONT TO DRIVE THROUGH THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
THE ADJACENT WATERS EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. IN WAKE OF THE COLD 
FRONT...ANOTHER MODIFYING STRONG CONTINENTAL POLAR ANTICYCLONE WILL 
MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES THIS WEEKEND...BEFORE 
DEPARTING INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC EARLY NEXT WEEK. A LACK OF BOTH 
MID AND UPPER LEVEL ASCENT AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WILL PROMPT 
ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT...FOLLOWED 
BY A BRIEF SPELL OF COOLER AND DRIER AIR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. 
THEREAFTER...WITH HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTING QUICKLY INTO THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC...MOISTURE AND MODIFYING TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN WITH A

OBSERVED LOCALLY...ALONG WITH A FEW STRANDS OF CIRRUS. LATEST DOPPLER
RADAR SCANS SHOW ISOLATED SHOWERS OF LIGHT RAIN MOVING WEST 10-15MPH
OVER THE WATERS SOUTH OF THE MARQUESAS KEYS AND DRY TORTUGAS.

A DEEP LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE WAS ANALYZED THIS EVENING OVER THE
BAHAMAS. RESULTING DEEP ANTICYCLONIC FLOW AND SUBSIDENCE OVER THE

TONIGHT OR EARLY SATURDAY. 

THE LARGE AREA OF GALE FORCE WINDS THAT AFFECTED THE WESTERN HALF OF 
THE GULF OF MEXICO YESTERDAY AND LAST NIGHT...GENERATED HIGH WAVES 
IN THAT AREA. DESPITE THE CURRENT WEAKENING OF THE WINDS BEHIND THE

FORECASTING DISPERSION OF WAVES OUT INTO THE EXTREME SE GULF AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT SATURDAY. NW OR WNW SWELLS AROUND 6 FT WITH 10 SECOND 
PERIOD ARE SHOWN TO REACH WATERS AROUND DRY TORTUGAS BY LATE MORNING 
OR MIDDAY...AND TRAVEL SOUTH OF THE REEF TO THE LOWER KEYS BY END OF

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A LARGE NORTH ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE EXTENDS A RIDGE OVER SOUTH 
FLORIDA...INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. SURFACE WINDS HAVE RELAXED ACROSS 
THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. ISLAND LOCATIONS ARE REPORTING 
MAINLY EASTERLY AT 10 TO 15 MPH. MARINE LOCATIONS ARE SHOWING 10 TO 
15 KNOTS...AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS. ISENTROPIC 
LIFT BETWEEN THE 300 AND 305K LEVEL. THIS HAS CONTRIBUTED TO 
CLUSTERS OF MOSTLY LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE STRAITS. A FEW OF THESE 
SHOWERS HAVE MANAGED TO JUST REACH THE ISLAND CHAIN. DAY TIME HIGHS 
HAVE COME UP INTO THE LOW TO MID 80S ACROSS THE KEYS.

.FORECAST...
THE CURRENT PRESSURE RIDGE DOMINATING OUR AREA WILL RETREAT INTO THE 
ATLANTIC. HOWEVER...THE NEXT FRONTAL TROUGH IS ALSO LIFTING OUT 
LEAVING BEHIND A DECAYING FRONT OVER THE CENTRAL GULF AND FLORIDA. 
THE NEXT CONTINENTAL HIGH WILL ESSENTIALLY BRIDGE OVER THESE REMAINS 
AND MERGE WITH THE ATLANTIC RIDGE. THIS WILL RESULT IN GENTLE TO 
MODERATE MAINLY EASTERLY WINDS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE 
ENVIRONMENT WILL REMAIN CAPPED TO DEEP CONVECTION THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND THANKS TO A STRONG AND STUBBORN MID AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
OVER OUR AREA. ISOLATED SHOWERS MOVING ALONG THE EASTERLY FLOW WILL 
BE THE SOURCE FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH THIS WEEKEND.

ANOTHER HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL FLUSH THE REMAINS OF THE PREVIOUS FRONT 
DOWN INTO THE KEYS. THE ENVIRONMENT NEVER REALLY BECOMES STABLE. AT 
MOST A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED. HOWEVER...WINDS WILL BACK AND 
STRENGTHEN TO AROUND 15 MPH LATE MONDAY...AND PERSIST THROUGH MUCH 
OF NEXT WEEK.

&&

.MARINE...
WINDS OVER THE GULF AND BAY WATERS WILL BE 10 TO 15 KNOTS 
TONIGHT...WHILE ATLANTIC WATERS WILL BE AROUND 15 KNOTS. A SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY FOR SEAS WILL REMAIN PROBABLY UNTIL LATER THIS 
EVENING. THROUGH THIS WEEKEND...WINDS ACROSS KEYS WATERS WILL BE 10 
TO 15 KNOTS. SEAS WILL BE GENERALLY BELOW ADVISORY AND CAUTION 
CRITERIA. A LONGER PERIOD SWELL OF 4 TO 6 FEET IS EXPECTED TO MOVE 
INTO OUR WESTERN WATERS BEGINNING SATURDAY AFTERNOON...AND PERSIST 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. AN EXERCISE CAUTION FOR SEAS MAY BE REQUIRED 
IN THESE WATERS FOR THESE PERIODS. ON MONDAY...A STALLED COLD FRONT 
WILL BE PUSHED TOWARDS THE KEYS BY THE NEXT STRONG HIGH PRESSURE 
SYSTEM TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES. WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
BACK AND STRENGTHEN. A SCEC OR SCA MAY BE REQUIRED ACROSS KEYS 
WATERS BEGINNING LATE MONDAY OR MONDAY NIGHT.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND

.CURRENTLY...
WHILE THE CENTER OF HIGH PRESSURE HAS SHIFTED FARTHER SE OVER THE 
ATLANTIC...AN ASSOCIATED RELATIVELY STRONG RIDGE STILL EXTENDS WEST 
INTO THE CAROLINAS. KEYS AREA WINDS REMAIN DRIVEN BY THIS 
ANTICYCLONE...WITH C-MAN OBSERVATIONS ON THE FLORIDA REEF ESE CLOSE

KEYS...INDICATED WINDS 20-23 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS...WITH LESSER
SPEEDS 12-18 KT OVER GULF WATERS W AND N OF THE LOWER KEYS. THE KEY 
WEST EVENING SOUNDING WAS ONLY SLIGHTLY WETTER THAN THIS MORNING...
WITH MOIST AIR GENERALLY LIMITED TO LEVELS BELOW 6 THSD FT. A 
STRONGER S TO SE WIND FLOW IS SETTING IN ALOFT...IN THE LEVELS 8 TO 
20 THSD FT ABOVE GROUND LEVEL...AND IR SATELLITE SUGGESTS AN OVERALL 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER THE PAST FEW HOURS THAT MAY BE PARTLY 
RELATED TO INCREASING MOISTURE IN THE UPPER LEVELS IN THE SSE FLOW. 
SURFACE TEMPERATURES REMAIN WARM...IN THE MID 70S...AND DEWPOINTS 
ARE NOW IN THE LOWER 70S. 

.FORECAST...
WINDS OVER KEYS ISLANDS ARE REPORTED TO BE NEAR OR JUST OVER 15 MPH 
MUCH OF THE TIME. I WILL GO AHEAD AND UPDATE PUBLIC ZONES TO REMOVE 
WIND TRANSITIONAL WORDING...INDICATING ISLAND WINDS NEAR 15 MPH FOR 
THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. 
&&

.MARINE...
THE STRONG COLD FRONT THAT IS SWEEPING OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO WITH GALE FORCE WINDS WONT BE A FACTOR TO KEYS WEATHER 
OVERNIGHT...AS THE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE HOLDS ITS INFLUENCE 
ON THIS CORNER OF THE GULF FOR A WHILE LONGER. LATEST MODELS 
INDICATE THAT THE RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT A BIT FARTHER SOUTH... 
BUT IT MAY BE CLOSER TO MORNING (OR VERY LATE TONIGHT)...BEFORE MUCH 
CHANGE IN LOCAL WINDS ARE NOTICED AS A RESULT. THEREFORE...SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORIES WILL REMAIN UP FOR BOTH WIND AND SEAS ON 
ATLANTIC-SIDE WATERS THROUGH THE NIGHT...WITH A DOWN TREND OF WIND 
SPEEDS INTO THE 15-20 KT RANGE NOT RELIABLE OUT BEYOND THE REEF 
UNTIL THE LATE NIGHT HOURS. ITS POSSIBLE THAT A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY
FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS MAY REMAIN UP FOR ATLANTIC WATERS FOR AT LEAST 
PART OF THE DAY FRIDAY.

CENTER OF A LARGER...SYNOPTIC SCALE WARM CORE ANTICYCLONE...WAS 
POSITIONED OVER THE WESTERN BAHAMAS...VERY NEAR ANDROS ISLAND. THE 
FLORIDA KEYS LIE BENEATH STRONG ANTICYCLONIC (SUBSIDENT) 
FLOW...UNDERNEATH A VERY DRY AND WARM MID AND UPPER ATMOSPHERE.

AT THE SURFACE AND IN THE LOWER LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 
100 PM...THE 1040 MB PLUS CENTER OF LARGE ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS NOW POSITIONED OVER NORTHERN IDAHO. THIS ARCTIC AIR 
ENCOMPASSES A GOOD PORTION OF THE WESTERN AND CENTRAL CONUS AND IS 
NOW PUSHING EASTWARD A STRONG COLD FRONT THAT IS CURRENTLY LOCATED 
FROM THE UPPER MICHIGAN PENINSULA SOUTHWEST TO WEST TEXAS. FARTHER 
EAST...A NEARLY 1030 MB WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
STRETCHES FROM ABOUT 30N 60W WESTWARD TO THE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS. 
THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN A VERY WARM AND MOIST MODERATE TO FRESH 
EASTERLY FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 15 KFT.

.CURRENTLY...SKIES ARE MOSTLY SUNNY. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY 
INDICATES SOME CUMULUS AND STRATO-CU ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS. 
TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN TO 81 DEGREES AT KEY WEST AND 84 DEGREES 
DEGREES AT MARATHON...WITH COMFORTABLE DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S. 
C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE REEF ARE REGISTERING SUSTAINED 10 METER 
EAST SOUTHEAST WINDS BETWEEN 18 AND 20 KNOTS...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
SAND KEY WHICH IS EXPERIENCING TECHNICAL DIFFICULTIES ATTM.
 
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...IN THE MID AND UPPER 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE(700-200 MB). LARGE SCALE PATTERN WILL NOT 
CHANGE MUCH...WITH GFS...NAM...AND UKMET INDICATING THAT THE STRONG 
WARM CORE 590 DM PLUS ANTICYCLONE WILL REMAIN DEFIANT....WITH THE 
CENTER OF THE ANTICYCLONE SLIDING SLOWLY ONLY EASTWARD THROUGH THIS 
TIME...ALLOWING FOR THE KEYS TO REMAIN BENEATH VERY WARM AND DRY AIR.

IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THE AFOREMENTIONED STRONG ARCTIC COLD FRONT NOW MOVING ACROSS THE 
PLAINS...WILL REACH THE OHIO VALLEY AND THE GULF STATES BY 
FRIDAY...AND THEN TO ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA BY SATURDAY. THE KEYS WILL 
REMAIN BENEATH THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE...WHICH WILL GRADUALLY 
BECOME SQUASHED SOUTHWARD THROUGH SATURDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
DECREASING GRADIENT ACROSS THE ISLANDS FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. 
UNTIL THEN...WILL HAVE MODERATE BREEZES OVER THE GULF...FLORIDA 
BAY...AND THE ISLANDS....WITH FRESH BREEZES ACROSS THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS. EXPECT ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES TO CONTINUE OVER THE 
ISLANDS THROUGH THE PERIOD AS WELL. LATEST NUMERICAL 12 HOUR RAIN 
CHANCES CONTINUE TO BE AROUND 10 PERCENT FOR THIS ENTIRE PERIOD...SO 
WILL LOWER POPS 10 PERCENT ON SATURDAY. THUS...THE KEYS WILL 
CONTINUE TO ENJOY BEAUTIFUL CHAMBER OF COMMERCE WEATHER...WITH 
PARTLY SUNNY SKIES ACCOMPANIED BY COMFORTABLE BREEZES...WARM 
TEMPERATURES...AND LOW RAIN CHANCES.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY )...
IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...GFS AND ECMWF CONSISTENT 
WITH INDICATIONS THAT ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL LIKELY DIVE SOUTHWARD 
ACROSS THE THE GREAT LAKES...AND THEN AMPLIFY INTO A TROUGH OVER THE 
OHIO VALLEY ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY...BEFORE THE MAIN AXIS OF THE 
TROUGH SLIDES OFF THE EASTERN SEABOARD. IT STILL REMAINS MORE 
QUESTIONABLE AS TO WHETHER THE TROUGH WILL DEEPEN FAR ENOUGH TO HAVE 
MUCH OF AN IMPACT TO OUR WEATHER.

IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...SUNDAY...APPEARS THAT 
THE FRONT WILL ONLY SLOWLY WORK ITS WAY DOWN THE PENINSULA. THERE 
WILL NOT BE ENOUGH MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS TO IMPACT THE KEYS WITH 
MORE THAN JUST SLIGHT RAIN CHANCES ATTM. 

MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THE COLD FRONT SHOULD FINALLY BE DRAGGED 
ACROSS THE KEYS ON MONDAY...BUT THE CURRENT ONLY SLIGHT 1000-850 
THICKNESS ADVECTION SUPPORTS UPPER 70S ON MONDAY...AND 70S FOR 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THE GFS HANGS THE FRONT OVER THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. WILL ALSO SEE INCREASING WINDS 
ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...AS ANOTHER 1030 RIDGE BUILDS OFF THE 
CAROLINAS ON THOSE DAYS...SO WILL INDICATE NEAR 15 KNOTS IN THE 
MARINE ZONES ON MONDAY.

&&

.MARINE...TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...WILL SEE AT LEAST ANOTHER NIGHT OF 
INCREASED WINDS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS...AND POSSIBLY DURING 
MUCH OF THE DAY ON THURSDAY. WITH THE NEARLY 1030 MB ATLANTIC RIDGE 
ALLOWING FOR 20 KNOT PLUS WINDS OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS. LATEST 12Z 
NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE FOR C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE REEF SUPPORTS AN 
EXTENSION OF THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY ON THE ATLANTIC WATERS. WINDS 
OVER FLORIDA BAY REMAIN BORDERLINE CAUTION FOR TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. 
WILL MAKE A LAST MINUTE DECISION FOR SCEC ACROSS FLORIDA BAY.

THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...WINDS AND SEAS WILL GRADUALLY 
DECREASE...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS IN THE GULF 
STREAM. 

SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...ANOTHER COOL FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
THRU...WITH BUILDING PRESSURES BEHIND. THIS COULD REINTRODUCE 
ADVISORIES...BUT WAY TOO EARLY TO SAY DEFINITIVELY.

.AVIATION...
EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AND AT THE 
KMTH AND KEYW ISLAND TERMINALS TONIGHT. ISOLATED SHOWERS MOVING 
QUICKLY TO THE WEST/NORTHWEST WILL CAUSE BRIEF MVFR VSBYS...AND CIGS

SOUTHEAST STATES. THIS HIGH PRESSURE CONFIGURATION WAS WELL DEPICTED 
BY MODELS...EXCEPT THE CENTRAL PRESSURE MAY HAVE VERIFIED AT 00Z (7 
PM EST) A COUPLE OF MB HIGHER THAN MODELS SHOWED. THIS SYSTEM 
CONTINUES TO PRODUCE A MAINLY EAST WIND FLOW OVER THE KEYS. C-MAN 
GAUGES ON THE FLORIDA REEF ARE HAVE SHOWN WIND SPEEDS COMING UP A 
FEW KNOTS THIS EVENING...AND MOST ARE REPORTING 10 METER WIND SPEEDS 
NEAR 20 KNOTS...ALTHOUGH SAND KEY WIND SPEEDS ARE A BIT ERRATIC. 
ISLAND WINDS HAVE COME DOWN SINCE SUNSET TO NEAR 10 MPH. SATELLITE 
QUIKSCAT PASSES MISSED THE KEYS REGION THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
DOPPLER RADAR SHOWS ENE WINDS VARYING BETWEEN 15 AND 20 KT AT 1 THSD 
FT AGL. THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING CONTINUES TO SHOW A STRONG 
INVERSION BASED 6 THSD FT ABOVE GROUND LEVEL...WITH VERY DRY AIR 
ABOVE THAT LEVEL. PATCHES OF STRATOCUMULUS UNDERNEATH THE INVERSION 
ARE SEEN ON IR SATELLITE...BUT CURRENTLY OVERALL COVERAGE OF THESE 
CLOUDS IS LESS THAN EARLIER TODAY. RADAR CURRENTLY IS DEVOID OF 
PRECIPITATION. AND...TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING IN THE MID 70S WITH 
COMFORTABLE DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
ISLAND WINDS MAY PULSE UP AND DOWN OVERNIGHT...PERHAPS LULLING A BIT 
WHEN SKIES OVERHEAD GO CLEAR. NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES IS 
WARRANTED...AND FORECAST PARAMETERS ARE ON TRACK.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
WE WERE IN AND OUT OF THE CLOUDS TODAY...THE APOTHEOSIS OF INTERVALS 
OF SUN AND CLOUDS. TEMPERATURES CLIMBED INTO THE LOWER 80S WITH A 
NICE EAST BREEZE AROUND 15 MPH. SPEEDS WERE 15 TO 20 KNOTS ON THE 
REEF. OUR RADAR STILL DETECTED SOME LIGHT RAIN OR SPRINKLES IN THE 
OUTER STRAITS SOUTH OF TORTUGAS.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE BIG CONTINENTAL SURFACE HIGH REMAINED IN CONTROL OF OUR WEATHER. 
IT WAS CENTERED NEAR RALEIGH...BUT ITS INFLUENCE EXTENDED FROM MAINE 
TO FLORIDA AND FAR OUT TO SEA. IT WAS ANCHORED BY RIDGING ALOFT 
WHICH EXTENDED RIGHT UP INTO THE STRATOSPHERE. WE FEEL IT WHEN 
OSCILLATIONS IN THE CENTRAL PRESSURE OCCUR...AND OUR WIND SPEEDS 
VARY BY +/- 5 KNOTS DIURNALLY. MOISTURE CONTENT IS LIMITED OUT OVER 
THE BAHAMAS WHICH IS OUR SOURCE REGION....AS SHOWN BY SATELLITE. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE HIGH WILL STRENGTHEN TONIGHT DUE TO COOLING...PUSHING UP OUR 
WINDS SLIGHTLY. WITH THE GOOD SUPPORT ALOFT THE HIGH WILL REMAIN 
MORE OR LESS IN PLACE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THAT MEANS GENERALLY 
EASTERLY WINDS BRINGING IN MILD TEMPERATURES...AND MINIMAL RAIN 
CHANCES IN THE STABLE MARINE AIR. LONG-RANGE GUIDANCE SHOWS A 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY STALLING IN NORTHERN FLORIDA THIS WEEKEND...AND 
THEN MAKING A SECOND EFFORT TO COME THROUGH THE KEYS EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. IN ACKNOWLEDGEMENT OF THIS WE HAVE LOWERED OUR TEMPERATURES 
FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...BUT HAVE NOT YET RAISED OUR RAIN CHANCES. 
WE CAN AFFORD TO WAIT AND SEE HOW IT SETS UP.
&&

.MARINE...
WE HAVE RAISED THE SMALL CRAFT FLAG FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY BUT 
ONLY IN THE ATLANTIC ZONES. WE EXPECT THE BAY AND THE GULF SIDE TO 
EXPERIENCE SOME SHELTER...PARTLY BECAUSE OF BACKING DUE TO MAINLAND 
INFLUENCE..AND PARTLY DUE TO COOLER WATER TEMPS WHICH INHIBIT 
TURBULENT MIXING. WIND SPEEDS ARE MARGINAL FOR THE ADVISORY BUT 
SIGNIFICANT WAVES TO 7 FEET GENERATED AT A DISTANCE ALSO WILL BE 
MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. IF YOU DO GO OUT GIVE US A REPORT -- WE 
MONITOR CHANNEL 16. 
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI INCLUDING THE MARATHON 
AND KEY WEST TERMINALS...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL WITH ONLY MVFR 
CEILINGS AND VISIBILITY DUE TO ISOLATED SHOWERS. OTHERWISE...AREAS

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
CLOUDS SKIRTED THE KEYS AND GAVE US A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY TODAY...AND 
TEMPERATURES CLIMBED INTO THE UPPER 70S AT THE REPORTING STATIONS. 
WINDS HAVE BEEN EAST TO NORTHEAST 15 TO 20 KNOTS IN THE STRAITS AND 
10 TO 15 IN THE BAY. WE HAVE RECEIVED NO REPORTS FROM OUR OFFSHORE 
GULF WATERS.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE EAST WINDS ARE EMANATING FROM A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE CELL 
CENTERED SOMEWHERE IN NORTH CAROLINA...AND WHOSE INFLUENCE EXTENDS 
THROUGHOUT THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION. THIS IS STABLE AIR WITH 
LOW MOISTURE CONTENT IN THE COLUMN AND SATELLITE SHOWS JUST 
SCATTERED CLOUDS IN OUR SOURCE REGION OVER THE BAHAMAS. THIS FEATURE 
IS IN CONTROL OF OUR WEATHER.
&&

.FORECASTS...
SO WE WATCHED THE EVOLUTION OF THE HIGH IN OUR GUIDANCE. FOR THE 
LAST FEW DAYS WE HAVE SEEN A COLD FRONT APPROACHING LATE IN THE 
WEEK...BUT NOT TODAY. THE EVOLUTION OF THE GUIDANCE ON THE FRONT HAS 
CONTINUED ITS TREND OF DELAYING IT IN TIME AND WEAKENING IT IN 
STRENGTH. TODAY THE FRONT COMES NO CLOSER THAN ORLANDO ON FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...BEFORE WASHING OUT OF SUNDAY. IT LOOKS LIKE THE RIDGING 
ALOFT IS JUST TOO STRONG.

THIS HAS SIMPLIFIED OUR FORECAST PROBLEMS. OUR GRIDS AND TEXT NOW 
SHOW CONTINUED EAST WINDS...WITH MILD TEMPERATURES AND MINIMAL RAIN 
CHANCES...RIGHT THROUGH THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS. SO THE WIND IS THE 
WEATHER...AS USUAL.
&&

.MARINE...
WIND SPEEDS ARE DIFFICULT TO JUDGE. WE ARE PRETTY CERTAIN THAT 
SPEEDS IN THE OUTER STRAITS ARE GREATER THAN THOSE SHOWN BY THE C-MAN
STATIONS -- THE WARM WATER OF THE GULF STREAM FEEDS TURBULENT ENERGY 
TO THE OVERLYING AIR -- BUT WE HAVE NO ROUTINE MEASUREMENTS OUT 
THERE. BY THE SAME REASONING THE COOLER WATERS OF FLORIDA BAY AND 
THE GULF SIDE SUBTRACT A LITTLE ENERGY FROM THE WIND. 

THEREFORE WE HAVE CONTINUED OUR CAUTIONARY STATEMENT ONLY ON THE 
ATLANTIC SIDE. IF YOU DO GO OUT...LET US KNOW THE CONDITIONS. WE 
LISTEN TO CHANNEL 16.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB 
ROUTE AND AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. WILL SEE OCCASIONAL

POSSIBLE IN ISOLATED RAIN SHOWERS. SURFACE WINDS WILL REMAIN

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
THE CLOUDS BROKE UP AND WE EXPERIENCED MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES TODAY. 
TEMPERATURES CLIMBED INTO THE MIDDLE 70S AT THE REPORTING STATIONS. 
WINDS TODAY HAVE VARIED. ON THE REEF WE OBSERVED 15-20 KNOTS...IN 
FLORIDA BAY AROUND 10 KNOTS. RADAR HAS BEEN SHOWING LIGHT ECHOES IN 
THE STRAITS. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
ANTICYCLONIC TENDENCIES PERSIST THROUGHOUT THE EASTERN STATES...AND 
GUIDANCE MAINTAINS THIS FEATURE OVER THE NEXT FOUR DAYS. THIS LOOKS 
REASONABLE WITH THE SUB-TROPICAL JET STREAM CURVING ANTICYCLONICALLY 
FROM TEXAS TO THE MID-ATLANTIC...AND THE POLAR JET WELL NORTH INTO 
CANADA.
&&

.FORECASTS...
WITH THIS SETUP WE EXPECT FRESH EAST TO NORTHEAST BREEZES FOR THE 
NEXT FOUR DAYS...ALONG WITH NEAR-NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND MINIMAL 
RAIN CHANCES. BY FRIDAY A COOL FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE 
NORTH. GUIDANCE HAS SHIFTED QUITE A BIT ON THIS FEATURE OVER THE 
LAST SEVERAL RUNS. IT NOW LOOKS LIKE OUR WINDS WILL SHIFT INTO THE 
SOUTHEAST ON FRIDAY...AND STAY THERE AS THE FRONT SLOWS OR STALLS TO 
OUR NORTH. THIS WILL MEAN WARMER TEMPS AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER RAIN 
CHANCES INTO THE COMING WEEKEND WITH THIS RELICT BOUNDARY IN OUR 
VICINITY. WINTER TAKES A SHORT BREAK.

FRESH EAST TO NORTHEAST BREEZES WILL MAINTAIN SIGNIFICANT WAVE

.DISCUSSION...
OUR CURRENT GRIDS AND FORECASTS LOOK OKAY AND NO CHANGES ARE 
ANTICIPATED THIS MORNING. WE HAD TO RE-RUN OUR WIND GUST TOOL TO 
CLEAN UP THE GRIDS IN FLORIDA BAY. 

AN AREA OF CLOUDS AND LIGHT RAIN...OR MAYBE JUST SPRINKLES...IS 
MOVING THROUGH FLORIDA BAY...THE UPPER KEYS AND THE MIDDLE KEYS. WE 
ALSO DETECT LIGHT SHOWERS IN THE STRAITS OUT OVER THE GULF STREAM. 
THIS IS ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY OUR TEN PERCENT POPS AND ISOLATED 
COVERAGE...AND THE MOVEMENT OF THE CLOUD MASS WILL AVERAGE OUT TO 
PARTLY CLOUDY AT ANY ONE LOCATION. 

SUSTAINED WINDS IN FLORIDA BAY ARE A LITTLE LOW ACCORDING TO THE 
LONG KEY C-MAN STATION. HOWEVER IT ALSO REPORTED A GUST TO 19 KNOTS 
AT 13Z SO WE WILL HOLD ON TO OUR FORECAST OF NEAR 15 KNOTS ON THE 
BAY. IT IS MORE DIFFICULT TO TELL WHAT IS HAPPENING IN OUR GULF 
WATERS. WE DID GET A PLETHORA OF SHIP REPORTS AT 12Z INCLUDING THE 
QUEEN ELIZABETH II OUT BY DRY TORTUGAS...FOR WHICH WE ARE 
THANKFUL...ALONG WITH A QUICKSCAT PASS. THESE SUPPORTED OUR WIND 
ESTIMATES. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS 
WILL PRODUCE AREAS OF CEILINGS ALONG THE ROUTE. MOST OF THESE WILL 
BE BASED AT VFR HEIGHTS BETWEEN 6000 AND 7500 FT AGL...BUT A FEW 
BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS BASED AROUND 2500-3000 FT AGL WILL OCCUR.

IN DAILY TEMPERATURES TO NORMAL (69F TO 78F) OR A FEW DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL. A LARGE UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE NOW OVER THE SW GULF OF 
MEXICO...IS STILL FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN A BIT AND MOVE DIRECTLY 
OVER FLORIDA BY TUESDAY...THEN HANG NEARBY TO OUR EAST FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY. THIS PATTERN OUGHT TO THWART SIGNIFICANT WEATHER-MAKERS IN

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...AS MENTIONED ABOVE...LATEST EXTENDED

SLIGHTLY MUTED OUR FORECASTED CHANCE OF RAIN...SLIGHTLY TONED DOWN

.FORECAST...
THE 12Z GFS RUN PRESENTS A SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT SOLUTION TO THE 
FRIDAY/SATURDAY FRONTAL PASSAGE AND WIND SURGE THAN THE PREVIOUS 
RUN. THE LATEST RUN BRIDGES THE HIGH THROUGH OUR CWA RATHER THAN A 
SHARP FRONTAL PASSAGE. THE RESULT IS THAT THE WINDS REPRESENTED BY 
THIS RUN ARE ON THE ORDER OF 10 KNOTS LESS ON SATURDAY...AND ARE 
MORE NORTHEASTERLY THAN NORTHERLY. 

OTHER THAN THE ABOVE...THERE ARE NOT MANY CHANGES TO THE MODELED

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES CLIMBED INTO THE LOWER 70S 
TODAY DESPITE NORTH WINDS 10 TO 15 MPH AT THE LAND STATIONS...10 TO 
15 KNOTS AT THE C-MAN PLATFORMS. SATELLITE SHOWED A LOT OF 
STRATIFORM CLOUDS IN THE ATLANTIC...AND REGIONAL RADARS DETECTED 
LIGHT ECHOES COMING ASHORE IN THE METRO. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE CLOUDS IN THE ATLANTIC ARE TRAPPED UNDER A CAPPING INVERSION 
WELL-DEPICTED ON THE MIAMI RAOB FROM 12Z TODAY. ISOBARIC ANALYSES 
MISS THE BEST CENTER OF ACTION WHICH SHOWS UP AT 6KFT. A LOCAL 
VORTICITY CENTER AT THIS ELEVATION HAS CAUSED LIFT AND BROUGHT ABOUT 
SATURATION AND CLOUDINESS. RESULTING COOLING HAS ELEVATED THE 
POTENTIAL TEMPERATURE SURFACES HELPING ISENTROPICS TO SUSTAIN THE 
PROCESS. 

AS THE CLOUDS AND LIGHT RAIN ARE EMBEDDED IN THE NORTHEAST FLOW WE 
EXPECT THESE CONDITIONS TO OVERSPREAD THE KEYS TONIGHT -- THUS OUR 
MINIMAL POPS. IN ADDITION...THE HIGH CELL OVER THE EASTERN U.S. IS 
STRENGTHENING AND THIS WILL ACT TO ENHANCE THE GRADIENT LOCALLY SO 
WE EXPECT INCREASING WINDS OVERNIGHT.
&&

.FORECASTS...
BEYOND THIS POINT CHANGE WILL BE SLOW UNTIL NEXT WEEK. GUIDANCE 
OFFERS RISING HEIGHTS THROUGHOUT THE EASTERN STATES MAINTAINING THE 
SURFACE ANTICYCLONE AND HENCE OUR EASTERLY WINDS AND NEAR-NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES AND RAIN CHANCES. BY THURSDAY NEXT WEEK THIS SETUP 
BREAKS DOWN AND ANOTHER FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL BE APPROACHING WHICH MAY 
HAVE SOME POWERFUL NORTH WINDS BEHIND IT FOR FRIDAY. FOR NOW WE HAVE 
INDICATED BREEZY AND COOLER WITH CHANCE POPS.
&&

.MARINE...
THE INCREASE IN WINDS TONIGHT WILL OCCUR GRADUALLY AND SPREAD FROM 
EAST TO WEST ACROSS OUR SERVICE AREA...PRETTY MUCH IN TANDEM WITH 
THE CLOUDS ETC. THE BAY AND THE GULF SIDE WILL RECEIVE SOME SHELTER. 
EXPOSED LOCATIONS SUCH AS THE OPEN STRAITS WILL GET ALL OF IT...SO 
WE HAVE RAISED A CAUTIONARY HEADLINE FOR THE ATLANTIC SIDE TONIGHT. 
IN ADDITION...NORTHERLY SWELL IS PENETRATING PAST KEY LARGO SO THE 
AREA AROUND CARYSFORT REEF LIGHT WILL BE ROUGH.

BEYOND THAT...IF YOU ARE PLANNING A PASSAGE LATE NEXT WEEK YOU WILL 
WANT TO KEEP ABREAST OF THE WEATHER.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI AVIATION 
ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING. FEW-SCT 
STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS WILL AFFECT THE ROUTE...WITH VFR CEILINGS NEAR 
FL035 POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE

THSD FT LEVEL AND UPWARDS OVERHEAD. A FEW BREAKS HAVE BEEN SEEN IN 
THE CLOUDS...BUT SATELLITE DEPICTION SUGGESTS THICKER CLOUDS...OR AT 
LEAST MORE SOLIDLY OVERCAST LAYERS...COMING IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST. 
SURFACE TEMPS HAVE BEEN STUCK IN THE 73-75F RANGE OVER THE KEYS 
ISLANDS. SURFACE WINDS HAVE COME DOWN CLOSER TO 10 KT AT MARINE WIND 
GAUGES...BUT MAY STILL BE BLOWING 10-15 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS. 
WIND DIRECTION IS NE TO N. NEAR WHERE THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY HAS 
STALLED FROM THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS TO CENTRAL CUBA...THUNDERSTORMS 
HAVE BROKEN OUT OVER WATERS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF CUBA WITH OTHER 
STORMS OVER THE CUBAN ISLAND MASS EAST OF THERE...INDICATING THE 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS STILL OUT THERE. RADAR SHOWS RAIN STARTING IN THE

.FORECAST...
I HAVE NOT MAKE ANY REALLY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO ONGOING FORECASTS. 

HIGHLIGHTS OF THE COMING WEEKS WEATHER...A LARGE AND SIGNIFICANT 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS STILL FORECAST BY MODELS TO START FORMING 
MONDAY EAST OF FLORIDA...FOLLOWED BY DRASTIC DEEPENING OF THIS 
SYSTEM (WHICH MAY BECOME COMPLEX WITH TWO CENTERS) AS IT POSSIBLY 
WHIRLS SOUTHWARD CLOSER TO THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY. A MOST UNUSUAL UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE IS ALSO STILL 
INDICATED IN ALL MODELS TO CUT OFF FROM THE WESTERLIES...DROP SOUTH 
NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA AND/OR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY BEFORE HEADING NORTHEAST THURSDAY. ALSO...MONDAY INTO 
MONDAY NIGHT...VERY STRONG JET DYNAMICS ARE STILL INDICATED TO COME 
INTO EXISTENCE OVER THE EAST GULF OF MEXICO AND FLORIDA...WORKING
DOWN OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. 

ALL IS NOT BAD NEWS AS A NICE WEEKEND STILL APPEARS IN STORE BEFORE 
THE TURN TO UGLIER WEATHER GETS STARTED EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE COOLEST 
TEMPERATURES OF THE SEASON ARE FORECAST TUESDAY MORNING INTO 
WEDNESDAY MORNING...WITH WINDY CONDITIONS CONCURRENT.

ADDITIONAL QUICK NOTES...
TONIGHT...SW FLOW ALOFT OUGHT TO KEEP CLOUDS FAIRLY SOLID. MODELS 
POPS ARE HIGH...60 PCT FOR GFS AND 40 PCT FOR NAM AND NGM. I WILL 
MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH 20 PCT...WHICH MAY BE MAINLY RAIN. OUT IN 
THE STRAITS...MODELS SHOW DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIS -2...SO I WILL 
INDICATE MORE COVERAGE AND STILL SLIGHT THREAT OF THUNDER OUT THERE. 

SAT-SUN NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE MAY INCREASE SOME OVER THE GULF SAYS 
THE GFS MODEL...WHICH WILL BOOST WINDS A BIT FROM THE NORTH. DRYING 
IS STILL EXPECTED TO SET IN BY SAT AFTERNOON...WITH A BIT COOLER 
THAN NORMAL TEMPS. MORE SUNSHINE SUN WILL BE WELCOME. 

MON-TUE...THIS IS A DIFFICULT FORECAST PERIOD. COOLER TEMPS AND 
WINDY ONSET BY LATE MON...MORE RELIABLE TUE...IS THE MORE FIRM 
FORECAST PARAMETERS. VERY STRONG JET DYNAMICS WILL SWEEP TO THE KEYS 
LATE MON AND MON NIGHT...BUT MOISTURE IS SHOWN LIMITED TO LOWEST 5 
THSD FT. THEN...VERY COLD AIR ALOFT IS INDICATE TO SETTLE OVER THE 
KEYS TUE (MINUS 22 CELCIUS OVER THE UPPER KEYS) WHILE MOISTURE IS 
STILL LIMITED. 20 PCT CHANCE SHOWERS WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE 
FORECAST BUT AN OPEN MIND STILL IS WARY OF THE EFFECTS OF THE JET 
WINDS AND THE COLD TEMPS ALOFT...WHICH COULD CREATE ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS OR MORE PREVALENT SHOWERS AND CLOUDS FOR A WHILE. 

WED-FRI...WINDS ONLY GRADUALLY COMING DOWN...TEMPS STILL BELOW 
NORMAL...BUT MAINLY DRY...IS INDICATED. 
&&

.MARINE...
SWELLS WILL GRADUALLY COME DOWN IN THE WESTERN STRAITS AND GULF 
WATERS TONIGHT...EXERCISE CAUTION UNTIL THEN. N WINDS SAT-SUN MAY 
BOOST CLOSER TO 15 KT...SO CHECK LATER FORECASTS...DEPENDING ON HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING A BIT OVER THE GULF. 

A CHAOTIC AND POTENTIALLY HAZARDOUS MARINE WEATHER PERIOD MAY SET IN 
MON AFTERNOON...GETTING WORSE TUE INTO WED AS STRONG LOW PRESSURE 
FORMS EAST OF FLORIDA AND HIGH PRESSURE COMES IN FROM THE WEST. 
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES WILL BE UP. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
TONIGHT...AND AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. SEVERAL LAYERS OF

COOL AND DRY MORNING AIR FROM MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA HAS FLOWED SOUTH
THROUGH THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS DURING THE DAY...KEEPING AIR
TEMPERATURES BELOW 70F THUS FAR. THE GOES-12 VISIBLE CHANNEL SHOWS
JUST A FEW THIN STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS DEVELOPING OVER THE WATERS
NORTH AND WEST OF KEY WEST. HOWEVER...IT HAS BEEN A SUNNY AND
PLEASANT DAY ACROSS THE ARCHIPELAGO THIS THANKSGIVING 2006.

THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN WILL UNDERGO A TRANSITION DURING THE NEXT FEW
DAYS...WITH A FAIRLY SHARP LONG WAVE RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER THE
EASTERN SEABOARD BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHTS WILL
GRADUALLY INCREASE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES OVER THE
WEEKEND...LEADING TO A STRENGTHENING AND EXPANDING SURFACE
ANTICYCLONE. THE MSL PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE BUILDING
ANTICYCLONE AND SEASONABLY LOW PRESSURES ACROSS THE NORTHWEST
CARIBBEAN WILL LEAD TO A FRESHENING NORTHEAST BREEZE LOCALLY STARTING
FRIDAY NIGHT. LOW-LEVEL AIR TRAJECTORIES INCREASINGLY ROOTED IN
HIGHLY MODIFIED AIR OVER THE SUBTROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC WILL RESULT
IN A GRADUAL WARMING AND MOISTENING OF THE AIR NEAR THE SURFACE
ACROSS THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS...AS WELL AS A DECREASE IN
STATIC STABILITY...AND AN INCREASE IN SHOWER CHANCES IN THE
FRESHENING NORTHEASTERLY FLOW. THIS HAS ALL BEEN ACCOUNTED FOR IN THE
FORECAST PACKAGE THIS AFTERNOON.

BASICALLY...A FINE AND FAIR WEATHER PATTERN IS EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT
SEVERAL DAYS...WITH GRADUALLY INCREASING TEMPERATURES...ONLY SLIGHT
SHOWER CHANCES...AND MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH NORTHEAST
BREEZES.

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING REVEALED 24-HOUR 50M+ HEIGHT RISES
FROM 700MB ON UP...AND ZONAL FLOW HAS DEVELOPED OVER MOST OF THE GULF
BASIN ABOVE 400MB. THE DEEP CYCLONE WHICH WAS NEAR THE GEORGIA COAST
DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HAS NOW MOVED NORTH-NORTHEAST TO A POINT
JUST OFF THE VIRGINIA COAST. A LOW-LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDS SOUTH FROM
THIS CYCLONE OVER THE BAHAMAS TO CENTRAL CUBA. GOES-12 MOISTURE
CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS SHOW A PATTERN OF MID-TROPOSPHERIC DRYING AND
SUBSIDENCE WEST OF THE TROUGH AXIS...AND DIRECTLY OVER THE SERVICE
AREA. THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS SEVERAL STABLE LAYERS
BETWEEN 2500-13000FT AGL...WITH VERY DRY CONDITIONS IN THE BOUNDARY
LAYER. 

LOW-LEVEL TRAJECTORIES INTO THE KEYS ARE NOW COMING OFF PENINSULAR
FLORIDA...PLACING MOST OF THE SERVICE AREA UNDER THE MAINLAND
SHADOW OF MORE STABLE LOW-LEVEL AIR...REDUCING CLOUD COVER TO
ALMOST NIL. THIS SETUP SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH TODAY AND FORECASTS
WILL BE ADJUSTED TO REDUCE SKY COVER...RENDERING SUNNY CONDITIONS. 
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE BREEZES NEAR 15KT WILL PERSIST FROM THE NORTH OR NORTHEAST
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH GUSTS 18-22KT. A RESIDUAL NORTHWEST SWELL UP TO
5FT WILL PERSIST OVER WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST. IN ADDITION...A SWELL
OF UP TO 4FT WILL BUILD IN THE GULF STREAM OFF THE UPPER KEYS...WITH
STEEPER WAVES IN THAT VICINITY.
&&

.AVIATION...

.DISCUSSION...
A COLD FRONT IS NOW STRETCHING FROM THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS 
SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS NORTH AND CENTRAL CUBA INTO THE WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN. EARLY MORNING IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A LENGTH EXTENT OF 
NARROW UPPER CLOUDS RIDING FROM THE SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO ACROSS 
SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. ACROSS THE KEYS...LOWER CLOUDS ARE 
EVIDENT AT VARIOUS LAYERS THROUGH ROUGHLY 6 KFT. THE ONLY 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES EARLY THIS MORNING ON KBYX RADAR ARE ALONG THE 
NORTHERN CUBAN COAST...WELL AWAY FROM OUR ATLANTIC MARINE ZONES.

.FORECAST...
THE FORECAST REASONING HAS NOT DEVIATED FROM THE PREVIOUS ISSUANCE 
IN A GENERAL SENSE...BUT THERE WILL BE SOME SMALL ADJUSTMENTS TO A 
FEW ELEMENTS IN THE SHORT TERM. HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO EXPAND 
ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH STATES AND THE NORTHERN GULF...ALLOWING FOR 
MODERATE SHALLOW NORTHERN BREEZES TO CONTINUE. QUIKSCAT SHOWS A 
SMALL AREA OF FRESH WINDS DROPPING THROUGH THE EASTERN GULF ALONG 
THE WEST FLORIDA COAST. BUT THE LATEST RUN OF GUIDANCE IS IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT THE BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS WILL REMAIN MODERATE TODAY 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE SERVICE AREA AND CONTINUING WELL INTO THE 
WEEKEND...STAYING MOSTLY FROM THE NORTH. THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW A 
STRONGER EPISODE OF MOISTURE AND LIFT OVER-RUNNING FROM 4 TO 5 KFT 
ON UPWARD THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. EVEN THOUGH ITS 12 HOUR 
POP NUMBERS ARE A GOOD 30 PERCENT HIGHER THAN THE NAM...ITS MASS 
FIELDS SEEM IN MUCH CLOSER AGREEMENT THAN THOSE NUMBERS WOULD 
DICTATE. INTERMITTENT LIGHT RAINS ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE ISLANDS AND 
GULF ZONES...WITH ONLY A SLIGHTLY HIGHER POP FOR THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING. HAVE ADJUSTED THE GRIDS TO COVER THIS 
SCENARIO...KEEPING ANY MENTION OF THUNDER IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
WHERE MARGINAL INSTABILITY PERSISTS DURING THAT TIME AS WELL. BY 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...DRIER AIR SINKS MUCH LOWER IN THE ATMOSPHERE AS 
THE INITIAL MID TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS SHIFTS EAST OF OUR 
LONGITUDE. A DRY FORECAST WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 
THE WEEKEND WITH TEMPERATURES ROUGHLY 5 DEGREES BELOW SEASONAL 
AVERAGE BOTH DAY AND NIGHT. BY MONDAY...A MORE SIGNIFICANT TROUGH 
GETS CARVED OUT OVER THE EAST/SOUTHEASTERN STATES EVOLVING INTO A 
STRONGER CLOSED SYSTEM JUST EAST OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA THROUGH 
THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THE LOCAL AREA SHOULD SEE A SURGE OF COOLER 
AIR WRAPPING AROUND THIS DEEP SYSTEM. THERE IS NO REASON TO DEVIATE 
FROM WHAT WE ARE ADVERTISING FOR THOSE LATER PERIODS...BUT AS STATED 
ON AN EARLIER SHIFT...STAY TUNED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A HIGHER 
RAIN THREAT AND EVEN STRONGER WINDS.

&&

.MARINE...
THE GULF MARINE ZONES...AND THE WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST TO BEYOND 
THE DRY TORTUGAS...WILL HAVE A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR SEAS 
MAINTAINED THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON THANKS TO NORTHWESTERLY SWELLS. 
LATEST MARINE GUIDANCE IS NOT AS STRONG OR PROLONGED WITH THESE 
HIGHER SEA CONDITIONS...AND THE NAM AND GFS ARE ACTUALLY QUITE CLOSE 
WITH WIND SPEEDS DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
SERVICE AREA. TAKING THAT INTO ACCOUNT...HAVE SLICED BOTH THE WINDS 
AND WAVES A LITTLE FOR ALL ZONES...WHICH SHOULD BRING THE WESTERN 
WATERS BELOW THE EXERCISE CAUTION CRITERIA BY LATER THIS AFTERNOON. 
BOATERS SHOULD STAY ABREAST OF LATER FORECASTS WHEN MAKING PLANS FOR 
THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. EXPECT A SURGE OF AT LEAST FRESH...COOL 
NORTHWESTERLY BREEZES.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT THE KEYW AND KMTH 
TERMINALS...AND ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE. PERIODIC MVFR/VFR 
CEILINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE BETWEEN 2500 TO 4000 FEET WITHIN BROKEN 
STRATUS DECKS ALONG THE FLIGHT ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS AROUND 10 KNOTS 
WILL GRADUALLY CLOCK FROM 340 DEGREES THIS MORNING TO 030 DEGREES BY 
LATER IN THE AFTERNOON.

FINALLY SOME EROSION OF THE STRATO CU DECK ALONG THE WESTERN HALF OF 
THE SERVICE AREA. WINDS ARE MOSTLY NORTH JUST BELOW 15 KNOTS ON 
AVERAGE AT THE CMANS...WITH THE LAST OF THE 20 KNOTS NEAR DRY 
TORTUGAS REGISTERED AT MIDNIGHT...AND WINDS ARE NEAR 10 MPH AT THE 
ISLAND SENSORS EARLY THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES AT THIS HOUR ARE IN 
THE UPPER 50S ALONG THE UPPER KEYS AND IN THE LOWER 60S ALL THE WAY 
DOWN TO KEY WEST. NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR.

.FORECAST...
THE DEEP CYCLONE ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST EARLY THIS MORNING WILL BE 
MOVING TO THE NORTHEAST AT AN ACCELERATED PACE OVER THE NEXT 48 
HOURS. IN ITS WAKE...DEEP RIDGING WILL BECOME ALIGNED  ALONG THE 
SOUTHEAST COAST WITH AN EXTENSION INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. OUR 
AIRMASS WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY DRY WITH ANY MOISTURE CONFINED AT AND 
BELOW 5 KFT THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH SUBSIDENCE CONTINUING THROUGH THAT 
LAYER DURING THAT TIME. A DRY FORECAST IS IN STORE THROUGH FRIDAY... 
AS THE LAST OF THE COOL ADVECTION GETS CUT OFF EARLY IN THIS 
FORECAST. AS THE LOW LEVEL FLOW VEERS TO THE NORTHEAST BY EARLY THIS 
WEEKEND...BETWEEN THE SETTLING HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH AND AN 
ELONGATED TROUGH AXIS LYING ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN BAHAMAS...SOME 
ATLANTIC MOISTURE GETS TAPPED. EXTENDED MOS GUIDANCE SUGGESTS JUST A 
MINIMAL MENTION OF SHOWERS AS EARLY AS FRIDAY NIGHT. SINCE THERE IS 
NO COMPELLING REASON TO CHANGE THAT...WILL LEAVE THE FORECAST FROM 
FRIDAY THROUGH DAY 7 UNTOUCHED. ASIDE FROM MINOR TEMPERATURES AND 
SKY NUDGES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT ALONG THE ISLANDS...NO OTHER 
CHANGES WILL BE INCOROPORATED INTO THE GRIDS FOR THIS UPCOMING 
ISSUANCE. EXPECT A STEADY MODERATING TREND TO THE TEMPERATURES TODAY 
AND FRIDAY...AND THEN A CONTINUATION OF NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE DURATION OF THE FORECAST. 

&&

.MARINE...
THE RESIDUAL SWELLS IN THE WESTERN WATERS ARE EXPECTED TO DIMINISH 
IN THE NEAR TERM...SO ALL HEADLINES WILL BE REMOVED ON THE MARINE 
FORECAST THIS MORNING AND THE ATLANTIC ZONES WILL BE CONSOLIDATED. 
THERE IS A SURGE OF NORTHEAST WINDS ANTICIPATED FOR SEVERAL HOURS 
FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING...WITH PERIODIC GUSTS AOA 20 KNOTS 
DURING THAT TIME. BUT AT THIS TIME DO NOT FEEL THAT ITS AFFECTS WILL 
BE OF LONG ENOUGH DURATION FOR AN ADVISORY. BOATERS SHOULD BE AWARE 
THAT AN EXERCISE CAUTION FOR SMALL CRAFT MAY BE NECESSARY FOR THE 
OPEN ATLANTIC WATERS DURING THAT TIME. OTHER THAN THAT...EXPECT A 
STEADY MODERATE NORTHEAST BREEZE THROUGH MONDAY.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN 
ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE NORTHWEST NEAR 10 MPH. C-MAN 
WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHWEST TO NORTH NEAR 10 KNOTS...WITH 
GUSTS NEAR 15 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 60S. ONLY ABOUT 
FIVE DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO GENTLE NORTHWEST 
SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S.   

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
A DEEP AND STRONG CYCLONE WILL BE CENTERED NEAR THE COAST OF NORTH 
CAROLINA TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS QUITE STABLE AND VERY 
DRY...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE JUST ABOVE THREE QUARTERS OF 
AN INCH. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE AND ATMOSPHERIC STABILITY SHOULD 
REMAIN CONSTANT TONIGHT. THE DRY AND STABLE AIR MASS IN PLACE WILL 
BE RESPONSIBLE FOR NO CHANCE OF MEASURABLE RAINFALL FOR THE FLORIDA 
KEYS TONIGHT. THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS 
HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...SO NO UPDATES ARE EXPECTED. 

&&

.MARINE...
ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT SEAS HAVE SUBSIDED BELOW 7 FEET ON ALL KEYS 
WATERS. BE THAT AS IT MAY...SMALL CRAFT ARE URGED TO EXERCISE 
CAUTION ON WATERS NORTH AND WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS TONIGHT. A SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED ON ALL KEYS WATERS AGAIN FRIDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY.   

&&

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ACROSS THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT

FOUND ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...OCCASIONALLY BROKEN TO 
OVERCAST...WITH SOME CEILINGS BETWEEN 4 AND 5 KFT. A FEW LOWER 
CLOUDS ARE POSSIBLE. HIGH PRESSURE TO THE WEST AND A DEPARTING OCEAN

AFTER RECORD EARLY MORNING LOWS...AIR TEMPERATURES REBOUNDED NICELY
TO NEAR 70F IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS...AND THE UPPER 60S IN THE
UPPER KEYS. A FEW THIN STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS POPULATE THE CELESTIAL
DOME CURRENTLY IN LOW-LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW...AND DOPPLER RADAR SCANS
ARE VOID OF PRECIPITATION ECHOES.

THE DEEP CYCLONE WHICH HAS BEEN GOVERNING THE WEATHER PATTERN OVER
THE KEYS FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS IS NOW CENTERED NEAR THE COAST OF
NORTH CAROLINA ACCORDING TO GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL LOOPS. THE
IMAGERY ALSO REVEALS DRYING AND SUBSIDENCE IN THE MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE
OVER THE KEYS.

THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL FEATURE THE
DEEP CYCLONE LIFTING NORTHEASTWARD AND WEAKENING WHILE A SHORT WAVE
RIDGE MOVES IN BEHIND IT FROM THE WEST. BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...A DEEP
TROUGH WILL BE DEVELOPING OUT WEST...WITH A WARM RIDGE STRENGTHENING
FROM THE CARIBBEAN BASIN NORTH OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THE RESULT FOR OUR FORECAST WILL BE A
FAIR WEATHER PATTERN WITH SLOWLY MODERATING TEMPERATURES. RAIN
CHANCES WILL BE NEAR ZERO THROUGH ABOUT FRIDAY...WITH ONLY A SLIGHT
CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE WEEKEND AND BEYOND...AS BUILDING HIGH
PRESSURE NORTH OF THE KEYS BRINGS IN MOIST ATLANTIC AIR.

COOL TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S CAN BE EXPECTED TONIGHT WITH THE
COOLEST READINGS IN THE UPPER KEYS.

FROM GLOBAL WAVE MODELS AND A LOCAL MESOSCALE MODEL.

A SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINE WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR ALL
OTHER MARINE ZONES EXCEPT FLORIDA BAY. THE CAUTION WILL APPLY TO BOTH

ABOVE THE SURFACE TO 5700FT AGL...NEAR THE BASE OF A STRONG 
SUBSIDENCE INVERSION LAYER. A VERY STABLE AND DRY AIR MASS WAS 
PRESENT FROM THE INVERSION LAYER UP TO 13000FT AGL. WE CAN ATTRIBUTE 
THE DRAMATIC CHANGES IN HEIGHT AND TEMPERATURE THROUGHOUT THE 
ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN OVER THE LAST FEW DAYS TO A DEEP COLD-CORE 
CYCLONE WHICH HAS NOW BECOME ELONGATED NEAR THE NORTH CAROLINA 
COAST.

A SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS THE OUTER CLOSED ISOBAR OF THE 
ATLANTIC CYCLONE MOVING FARTHER AWAY FROM SOUTH FLORIDA. 
MEANWHILE...A WEAKENING HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS CENTERED OVER THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. LOCALLY...IT APPEARS THAT A WEAK 
MESOSCALE HIGH PRESSURE CELL HAS DEVELOPED BETWEEN FLORIDA BAY AND 
THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...CAUSING WINDS TO GO LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE OVER MUCH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN WHILE PULASKI SHOAL CONTINUES 
BLOWING NEAR 20KT. THE LOCAL WRF/NAM HAS INITIALIZED THE SITUATION 
BETTER THAN THE SYNOPTIC MODELS AND SHOWS THE GULF RIDGE OVERTAKING 
THE MESOSCALE CELL WITH NORTHWEST BREEZES FRESHENING LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND THIS IS THE SCENARIO WE ARE APPLYING TO THE FIRST 
PERIOD FORECAST. TEMPERATURES HAVE ALREADY REACHED THE UPPER 60S 
AFTER RECORD LOWS IN THE 40S AND 50S...AND WILL PROBABLY INCREASE A 
FEW MORE DEGREES TO 70F. FORECASTS WILL BE UPDATED ACCORDINGLY. &&

940 PM EST TUE NOV 21 2006

...NEAR-RECORD COLD EXPECTED TONIGHT WITH LOW TEMPERATURES RANGING 
FROM THE MID 50S IN KEY WEST TO THE UPPER 40S IN OCEAN REEF...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE 
AREA FROM CRAIG KEY TO THE DRY TORTUGAS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE 
NORTHWEST TO NORTH NEAR 15 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE 
NORTHWEST TO NORTH AT 15 TO 20 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 60 
DEGREES. ONLY ABOUT SIX DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE 
TO MODERATE NORTHWEST TO NORTH SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S.   

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
A DEEP AND STRONG COLD-CORE CYCLONE WILL BE CENTERED NEAR THE 
CAROLINA COAST TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS EXTREMELY 
STABLE AND RELATIVELY DRY...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUE 
JUST ABOVE THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH. IN ADDITION...THE 00Z KEY WEST 
SOUNDING DEPICTS A 7 DEGREE CELSIUS TEMPERATURE INVERSION NEAR 650 
MB AND A VERY LOW FREEZING LEVEL OF AROUND 6500 FEET. ATMOSPHERIC 
MOISTURE SHOULD DECREASE TONIGHT. BY SUNRISE WEDNESDAY...PWAT VALUES 
SHOULD BE JUST UNDER ONE HALF OF AN INCH. THE DRY AND STABLE AIR 
MASS IN PLACE WARRANTS NO CHANCE OF MEASURABLE RAINFALL FOR THE 
FLORIDA KEYS TONIGHT. THE COLDEST NIGHT OF THE SEASON THUS FAR IS 
EXPECTED TONIGHT WITH MINIMUM TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM THE MID 50S 
IN KEY WEST TO THE UPPER 40S IN OCEAN REEF. 

&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR ATLANTIC AND GULF WATERS 
TONIGHT. WELL-DEVELOPED SEAS SHOULD BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORIES CONTINUING FOR WATERS NORTH AND WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS 
WEDNESDAY. SEAS SHOULD SUBSIDE BELOW SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CRITERIA 
ON ALL KEYS WATERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TONIGHT. A VERY FAR SOUTH BUT WELL DEFINED MID 
LATITUDINAL CYCLONE FOR MID NOVEMBER WILL MOVE SLOWLY 
NORTHEASTWARD OFF OF THE FLORIDA/GEORGIA COAST. THIS WILL CONTINUE 
TO RESULT IN COLD AIR ADVECTION ACROSS WARM GULF OF MEXICO WATERS. 
THEREFORE...PILOTS WILL ENCOUNTER STRATOCUMULUS CEILINGS...
ESPECIALLY OVER THE WATER PORTION OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...
BUT THESE CEILINGS SHOULD REMAIN VFR WITH BASES GENERALLY BETWEEN 
3500 AND 7000 FT AGL. JUST BRIEF MVFR CEILINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN 
PATCHES OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN...MAINLY NEAR KEY WEST.

THE ATMOSPHERE ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE REMAINS QUITE COLD 
BUT IS ALSO MODERATELY MOIST IN THE LOWER LEVELS. PILOTS WILL 
ENCOUNTER LIGHT TO MODERATE ICING FROM 7000 AND 25000 FEET...WITH 
OCCASIONAL MODERATE TURBULENCE IN THE UPPER LEVELS BETWEEN 25000 AND 
40000 FEET. AT 0030Z THIS EVENING...A PILOT REPORTED MODERATE 
TURBULENCE AT FL160 OVER MARATHON. 

PLEASE CHECK ALL AVAILABLE SIGMETS AND AIRMETS FROM THE CENTRAL 
WEATHER SERVICE UNIT.

...NEAR-RECORD COLD EXPECTED TONIGHT WITH LOW TEMPERATURES RANGING
FROM MID 50S IN KEY WEST TO UPPER 40S IN OCEAN REEF...

.DISCUSSION...
AIR TEMPERATURES HAVE STRUGGLED TO REACH THE MID 60S TODAY ACROSS
MOST OF THE FLORIDA KEYS...PRIMARILY DUE TO AIR TRAJECTORIES ROOTED
IN COOL...CONTINENTAL AIR WHICH HAS ONLY BEEN SLIGHTLY MODIFIED. KEY
WEST DOPPLER VAD WIND PROFILE MEASUREMENTS SHOW A BACKING LOW-LEVEL
WIND PROFILE...INDICATIVE OF CONTINUED COLD-AIR ADVECTION. LATEST
RADAR SCANS SHOW NUMEROUS SPRINKLES OVER THE SERVICE AREA WEST OF
ABOUT SUGARLOAF KEY...WITH A FEW NORTH-SOUTH BANDS OF HEAVIER RAIN
MOVING QUICKLY EAST. LATEST IMAGES FROM THE GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL
SHOW A DEEP AND VIGOROUS COLD-CORE CYCLONE CENTERED NEAR THE GEORGIA
COAST. A TROUGH/VORTICITY AXIS EXTENDS SOUTH FROM THE CYCLONE TO NEAR
THE CUBAN COAST. THIS TROUGH/VORTICITY AXIS MOVED THROUGH THE KEYS
EARLIER TODAY.

THE INFLUENCE OF THE DEEP CYCLONE WILL GRADUALLY WANE OVER THE NEXT
FEW DAYS...AS IT SLOWLY WEAKENS AND LIFTS NORTHWARD. THE COLDEST
NIGHT OF THE SEASON THUS FAR IS EXPECTED TONIGHT WITH MINIMUM
TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM THE MID 50S IN KEY WEST TO THE
UPPER 40S IN OCEAN REEF. LIGHT SPRINKLES SHOULD END LATER THIS
EVENING...WITH STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS THINNING AS SUBSIDENCE AND DRYING
INCREASE ALOFT. 

A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WITH LITTLE CHANCE FOR RAINFALL IS EXPECTED
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THANKSGIVING DAY IS SHAPING UP TO BE A
VERY PLEASANT DAY WITH LIGHTER WINDS AND MILD TEMPERATURES. 

SLIGHT SHOWER CHANCES WILL RETURN BY SATURDAY AS LOW-LEVEL FLOW
BECOMES MORE EASTERLY...SHIFTING AIR TRAJECTORIES OFF THE MOIST
ATLANTIC.
&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL ZONES. FRESH TO
STRONG NORTHWEST TO NORTH BREEZES SHOULD SLACKEN A BIT OVERNIGHT...
BUT WELL-DEVELOPED SEAS MAY KEEP UP ADVISORIES FOR SOME AREAS THROUGH
WEDNESDAY. MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH BREEZES ARE EXPECTED FROM
THE NORTH AND THEN NORTHEAST OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS THROUGH TONIGHT. STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS IN 
SEVERAL LAYERS WILL PRODUCE CEILINGS...ESPECIALLY ALONG THE KEYS 
PORTION OF THE ROUTE...BUT THESE SHOULD REMAIN VFR WITH BASES 
GENERALLY BETWEEN 4000 AND 8000 FT AGL. HOWEVER...SOME PATCHES OF 
LIGHT RAIN WILL PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS/VISIBILITIES IN 
THE VICINITY OF KEY WEST.

SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE NORTHWEST TO NORTH AT 10 KT 
OR LESS...BUT MAY BE A BIT HIGHER IN KEYW AS PATCHES OF RAIN PASS 
THROUGH. HOWEVER...10 KT OR GREATER CROSSWINDS SHOULD BE FEW AND FAR 
BETWEEN.

THIS MORNINGS KEY WEST RAOB INDICATED A FREEZING LEVEL OF 7000 FT 
AGL...AND A VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE BELOW ABOUT 12000 FT AGL. THE 
MIAMI RAOB SIMILARLY INDICATED A FREEZING LEVEL JUST BELOW 8000 FT 
AGL WITH A SOMEWHAT MOIST ATMOSPHERE BELOW 14000 FT AGL. AT 18Z A 
PILOT REPORT FROM THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS INDICATED SEVERE RIME AND 
MIXED ICING AT FL250. PILOTS ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE SHOULD 
BE ALERT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF ICING TODAY AND TONIGHT. IN 
ADDITION...THERE IS AN AIRMET IN EFFECT UNTIL 09Z TOMORROW FOR MOST

.DISCUSSION...
KEYS RESIDENTS AND VISITORS AWOKE TO A CLOUDY...RAINY...WINDY...AND 
COLD MORNING WITH AIR TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S...A SITUATION THAT IS 
VERY RARE AT THIS LOW LATITUDE. LATEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW 
BANDS OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN WITH HEAVIER EMBEDDED CONVECTIVE 
CELLS MOVING QUICKLY SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA GENERALLY WEST OF THE 
SEVEN MILE BRIDGE. A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE ALSO BEEN DETECTED 
WITH A FEW OF THE HEAVIER CELLS...WITH ECHO TOPS AS HIGH AS 20000FT 
AGL. 

THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING IS...QUITE FRANKLY...AMAZING FOR THIS 
LOCATION. CONSIDER THE FOLLOWING DATA:

FREEZING LEVEL....  6943 FT AGL
850 MB TEMP.......  4.2 C
700 MB TEMP....... -4.1 C
500 MB HEIGHT.....  5660 M
0-6KM BULK SHEAR... 90 KT

GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS REVEAL THE CULPRIT...A DEEP AND 
VIGOROUS COLD-CORE CYCLONE CENTERED OVER SOUTHEAST GEORGIA. THE 
LATEST IMAGES ALSO SHOW A TROUGH/VORTICITY AXIS EXTENDING SOUTH FROM 
THE CYCLONE OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND KEYS TO WESTERN CUBA. 
ANALYSES OF NUMERICAL MODEL FIELDS AT 12Z REVEALED INTENSE CYCLONIC 
VORTICITY ADVECTION AND STRONG ASCENT IN THE 850-700MB LAYER OVER 
THE KEYS. MEANWHILE...BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW NEAR 20KT WITH SEA-AIR 
TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES AROUND 12C ARE PROMOTING INTENSE UPWARD 
FLUXES OF HEAT AND MOISTURE. THIS COMBINATION OF STRONG QUASI- 
GEOSTROPHIC ASCENT AND BOUNDARY LAYER PUMPING HAS RESULTED IN NEAR 
SATURATION OF THE 1000-850MB LAYER WITH BANDS OF STRATIFORM RAIN AND 
EMBEDDED SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED LIGHTNING STRIKES IN THE HEAVIEST 
CONVECTIVE CELLS. 

AT THE SURFACE...FRESH TO STRONG...AND VERY GUSTY...NORTH BREEZES 
ARE BLOWING AT ALL C-MAN SITES WITH THE HIGHEST WINDS OBSERVED OUT 
AT PULASKI SHOAL IN THE DRY TORTUGAS.

FORECAST REASONING REMAINS ON TRACK. THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC 
TROUGH/VORTICITY AXIS IS EXPECTED TO CLEAR THE KEYS BY 2PM EST. 
THEREAFTER...MID AND HIGH CLOUD COVER WILL THIN AND RAIN SHOULD END. 
HOWEVER...SCATTERED STRATOCUMULUS VARIETIES WILL PERSIST WITH 
OCCASIONAL CEILINGS. SOME SUN SHOULD ALLOW ISLAND TEMPERATURES TO 
REACH THE MID 60S...BUT WE WILL MONITOR TRENDS BEFORE ISSUING A 
FORECAST UPDATE AROUND NOON FOR THE TRANSITION.
&&

.MARINE...
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES ARE UP FOR ALL ZONES. A BLUSTERY DAY IS IN 
STORE WITH FRESH TO STRONG BREEZES AND TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S AND 
60S MAKING FOR A VERY RAW DAY OUT ON THE WATER. WINDS WILL BE VERY 
GUSTY DUE TO THE LARGE SEA-AIR TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCES. SEAS WILL 
CONTINUE BUILDING...WITH HIGHEST SEAS IN THE WESTERN WATERS... 
EXCEEDING 10-12 FEET IN DEEP WATER SOUTH OF THE DRY TORTUGAS. 
NORTH-SOUTH CHANNELS BETWEEN ISLANDS WILL BE VERY ROUGH. REBECCA 
CHANNEL WILL BE PARTICULARLY NASTY. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. SKIES SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR ALONG 
THE MAJORITY OF THE ROUTE EXCEPT IN AND AROUND THE LOWER 
KEYS...WHERE PATCHES OF RAIN AND STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS BASED ANYWHERE 
FROM 2000 TO 4500 FT AGL WILL PRODUCE INTERMITTENT MVFR CEILINGS AND 
VISIBILITIES. THESE SHOULD END BY MID AFTERNOON OR SO.

WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE NORTH TO NORTHEAST AROUND 12-15 KT 
WITH HIGHER GUSTS...THEN BECOME NORTHWEST TO NORTH THIS AFTERNOON. 
THIS WILL RESULT IN 10 KT OR GREATER CROSSWINDS FOR VIRTUALLY ALL OF 
TODAY...WITH BRIEF PERIODS OF 15 KT CROSSWINDS AT KEYW.

THE 12Z KEY WEST RAOB INDICATED A FREEZING LEVEL OF 7000 FT 
AGL...AND A VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE BELOW ABOUT 12000 FT AGL. THE 12Z 
MIAMI RAOB SIMILARLY INDICATED A FREEZING LEVEL JUST BELOW 8000 FT 
AGL WITH A SOMEWHAT MOIST ATMOSPHERE BELOW 14000 FT AGL. PILOTS 
SHOULD BE ALERT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF ICING TODAY. IN 
ADDITION...THERE IS AN AIRMET IN EFFECT UNTIL 03Z TOMORROW FOR MOST 
OF THE TWEB ROUTE FOR OCCASIONAL MODERATE TURBULENCE BETWEEN FL130 
AND FL400.

.DISCUSSION...
KBYX RADAR IS INDICATING AREAS OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN ADVANCING 
TO THE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA. SOME OF THE HEAVIER 
EMBEDDED SHOWERS ARE ACCOMPANIED BY WIND GUSTS CLOSE TO 30 KNOTS. 
THE PUSH OF GENERALLY STRONGER WINDS IS ALSO ADVANCING EASTWARD 
TOWARD THE EASTERN HALF OF THE SERVICE AREA CURRENTLY. TEMPERATURES 
RANGE FROM THE MID 60S ALONG THE LOWER KEYS...NEAR 60 ALONG THE 
MIDDLE KEYS...AND IN THE UPPER 50S IN THE UPPER KEYS AT THIS HOUR. 
BUT THEY HAVE BEEN FALLING QUICKLY. IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW A RAPID 
ADVANCE OF CU THROUGHOUT THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...AND MORE 
LAYERED CLOUDS UNDER A THINNING UPPER STRIP OF CI ALONG AND TO THE 
EAST OF THE ISLAND CHAIN.

.FORECAST...
IN A GENERAL SENSE...FORECAST REASONING HAS NOT CHANGED FOR THE 
UPCOMING ISSUANCE. A FEW SUBTLE ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE INCORPORATED 
THOUGH. THERE HAS BEEN A FEW POCKETS OF LIGHTNING ASSOCIATED WITH A 
FEW STRONGER CELLS WELL OUT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. BUT THESE FEW 
POCKETS HAVE BEEN STEADILY PRODUCING LIGHTNING OVER THE PAST COUPLE 
OF HOURS AND ARE MAKING QUICK PROGRESS TOWARD OUR WESTERN MARINE 
ZONES. SO WILL ADD A MENTION OF AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM FOR THOSE 
AREAS. AT THIS TIME...I DO NOT THINK THEY WILL POSE ENOUGH OF A 
THREAT TO ADD THE MENTION ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN...BUT WILL KEEP A 
CLOSE EYE ON THEM OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR SO AND MAYBE NEED TO ADD A 
MORNING MENTION FOR THE LOWER KEYS. OTHERWISE...GUIDANCE INDICATES 
THE THE LOWER TO MID LEVEL FORCING WILL WEAKEN LATE THIS MORNING OR 
VERY EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON...AND THE FAVORED POSITION OF THE UPPER 
JET WILL ALSO PUSH OFF TO THE EAST BY THEN. SO PREFER TO KEEP A 
TAPERED MENTION OF PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...AND WE 
SHOULD SEE A BIT MORE SUN THEN TOO. QUITE COOL THOUGH WITH 
TEMPERATURES NOT MOVING ABOVE THE MID 60S. TONIGHT WILL BE THE 
COOLEST TEMPERATURES OF THE SEASON WITH LOWER 50S IN THE UPPER KEYS 
AND MID 50S ELSEWHERE...CLOSE TO SOME RECORD VALUES FOR THAT DATE. 
ANOTHER COOL DAY WEDNESDAY...BUT NOT AS COOL AS TODAY...AND THEN 
MORE MODERATING TEMPERATURES EXPECTED THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE 
FORECAST.

&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR ALL MARINE ZONES TODAY. 
THIS MAY NEED TO BE EXTENDED THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY TONIGHT MOST 
ZONES...BUT MORE DEFINITELY FOR THE WATERS TO THE WEST OF KEY WEST 
AND THE GULF WATERS ADJACENT TO THE LOWER KEYS AS SEA SWELLS WILL 
TAKE TIME TO DIMINISH. WILL ALSO HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THOSE 
WESTERN MARINE ZONES INITIALLY TO POSSIBLY NUDGE WINDS AND SEAS UP A 
LITTLE. A SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED 
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT MOST ZONES. MORE AGREEABLE BOATING 
CONDITIONS SHOULD BEGIN ON THANKSGIVING...AND THEN EVEN MORESO ON 
FRIDAY WITH A MORE UNIFORMLY MODERATE NORTHEAST FLOW.

&&

.AVIATION...
THE MAIN ISSUE FOR TODAY WILL BE MODERATE CROSSWINDS AND VFR 
CEILINGS. A DEEPENING LOW OFF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST IS FORCING 
NORTHWEST WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS TO 25 KNOTS. 
CROSSWINDS OF AROUND 15 KNOTS CAN BE ANTICIPATED AT KEYS  TERMINALS. 
THE MOST PREVALENT CLOUD LAYER WILL BE USUALLY BASED AROUND 6 TO 8 
KFT. SWATHES OF LIGHT RAIN...WITH EMBEDDED MVFR SHOWERS WILL MOVE 
RAPIDLY EASTWARD ACROSS THE ROUTE.

HOUR RAIN CHANCES OF 30 PERCENT HANDLE THE UNCERTAINTY WELL
ENOUGH...AND ARE IN LINE WITH A MOS CONSENSUS. AN INCREASING MSL

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1007 AM EST MON NOV 20 2006

.DISCUSSION...
GOES-12 VISIBLE CHANNEL IMAGES AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS REVEAL 
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS. AIR TEMPERATURES RANGE 
FROM THE LOWER 60S IN THE UPPER KEYS TO THE UPPER 60S IN THE LOWER 
KEYS. WINDS DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS HAVE AVERAGED NORTH OR 
NORTHEAST 10-15KT AT REEF AND BAY MARINE SITES...A LITTLE HIGHER AT 
PULASKI SHOAL IN THE DRY TORTUGAS...AND ALSO BEYOND THE REEF OVER 
THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA...ACCORDING TO AN EARLY MORNING QUIKSCAT 
PASS. A TRANSITION TO WINDIER CONDITIONS IS STILL EXPECTED LATER 
TODAY PER FORECAST REASONING BELOW. /KBK

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
EARLY MORNING IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW UPPER CLOUDS THICKENING FROM 
THE W/SW...AND AREAS OF CU WORKING CLOSER TO THE KEYS FROM THE 
EAST/SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. WINDS ARE MODERATE OUT OF THE 
NORTH ALL AREAS BUT ANALYSIS AND QUIKSCAT DATA INDICATE FRESHENING 
NORTH TO NORTHWEST WINDS ARE SLIDING DOWN THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO 
TOWARD OUR WESTERN WATERS. CURRENT TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 60S 
IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS AND IN THE LOWER 60S IN THE UPPER KEYS. 
NOT TOO FAR NORTH...SURROUNDING METRO MIAMI...THERE ARE TEMPERATURES 
5 TO 10 DEGREES COOLER THAN THAT. NO ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR.

.FORECAST...
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE DIGGING TROUGH WORKING SOUTHWARD 
THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS WILL 
EVOLVE INTO A CLOSED CIRCULATION OVER GEORGIA AND NORTH FLORIDA 
LATER TODAY. IN THE LOWER LEVELS...A COMPLEX LOW PRESSURE PATTERN 
STRETCHING FROM JUST OFF THE NORTH FLORIDA COAST TO THE NORTHERN 
BAHAMAS WILL BEGIN TO CONSOLIDATE CLOSER TO THE SOUTHEAST COAST 
THROUGH TONIGHT...TUESDAY AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. THIS IS NOT DIFFERENT 
FROM ANYTHING DEPICTED OVER THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS FOR THAT TIME 
PERIOD...BUT THERE STILL REMAINS SOME UNCERTAINTY FOR THE LOCAL 
AFFECT...AT LEAST AS FAR AS WINDS AND SEA CONDITIONS ARE CONCERNED. 
BOATERS...SEE THE MARINE DISCUSSION BELOW. AS FAR AS AFFECTS ALONG 
THE ISLAND...WE STILL EXPECT BREEZY CONDITIONS TO DEVELOP THROUGH 
THIS AFTERNOON ALL LOCATIONS. BUT THE LATEST NAM AND GFS BOTH ARE 
SHOWING A GOOD 4 TO 5 KNOT DECREASE IN WINDS FOR THE TONIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME WHEN COMPARED TO THE MODEL RUNS OVER THE PAST 
48 HOURS...AND A DISTINCT SHADOWING AFFECT ACROSS THE ISLANDS FROM 
TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...MORE EVIDENT ACROSS THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 
KEYS. THERE IS ALSO EVIDENCE OF A LOOSER PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS 
THE ENTIRE AREA DURING THAT TIME. I HAVE MADE SOME SMALL DOWNWARD 
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE WIND GRIDS IN THE SHORT TERM THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...BUT NOT IN A DRASTIC SENSE SINCE THERE SHOULD BE GOOD 
MIXING OF THE COOLER AIR ACROSS THE RELATIVELY WARM WATERS 
SURROUNDING THE ISLANDS. ALSO...BOTH THE NAM AND GFS ARE CLOSE 
ENOUGH IN THEIR POP NUMBERS NOT TO DEVIATE FROM OUR PREVIOUS WEATHER 
AND POP GRIDS FOR TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. A MINIMAL MENTION OF 
SHOWERS WILL WORK FOR TODAY. A LOOK THROUGH THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS 
SUPPORTS THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS MENTIONED FOR TONIGHT. GFS KEEPS AN 
UNSTABLE AND FORCED LOWER PROFILE INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE DAY ON 
TUESDAY...BUT THE HIGHER LOBE OF MID LEVEL ENERGY SHOULD BE WRAPPED 
TO OUR EAST BY THEN UNDER THE UNFAVORABLE AREA OF THE UPPER JET. 
THESE NUMBERS MAY INDEED NEED TO BE ADJUSTED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE 
FORECAST ISSUANCES. STAY TUNED. TEMPERATURE-WISE...GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
HAVE RECOVERED BY A DEGREE FOR BOTH TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT 
THIS WILL STILL BE A COOL AND BREEZY/WINDY NIGHT ESPECIALLY BY KEYS 
STANDARDS. NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE 
GRIDS FROM WEDNESDAY ONWARD. WE SHOULD SEE A MODERATING TREND TO THE 
TEMPERATURES AS HIGH PRESSURE FINALLY REPLACES THE LOWER PRESSURE 
ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA. WE WILL STILL BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW SEASONAL 
AVERAGE THROUGH FRIDAY...AND VERY CLOSE TO SEASONAL FOR THE WEEKEND. 
ONLY A MINIMAL MENTION OF SHOWERS WILL BE INSERTED FOR THE COMING 
WEEKEND.

&&

.MARINE...
CONFIDENCE IS NOW HIGH ENOUGH TO RAISE A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR 
BOTH THE GULF WATERS AND THE WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST TO BEYOND DRY 
TORTUGAS. THERE IS LOWER CONFIDENCE ON THE EXACT LEVEL AND TIMING OF 
HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS FOR BOTH THE BAY AND ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT 
TO THE ISLAND CHAIN. ALTHOUGH THERE SHOULD BE DECENT MIXING AS THE 
COOLER AIR CROSS THESE WATERS...AS STATED ABOVE...THE LATEST 
GUIDANCE IS A BIT BAGGIER WITH THE PRESSURE FIELDS AND RESULTANT 
WINDS FROM TONIGHT ALL THE WAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WAVE WATCH 
MODELING KEEPS THESE WATERS MARGINAL AT LEAST AS FAR AS SEAS ARE 
CONCERNED. THATS NOT TO SAY CONDITIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR SMALL 
CRAFT. I WILL HAVE AN EXERCISE CAUTION FOR THOSE WATERS INITIALLY 
AND WE WILL NEED TO KEEP AN KEEN EYE ON CONDITIONS TODAY. PLAN FOR A 
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR ALL WATERS TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 

EXPECT IMPROVEMENT FOR WINDS AND SEAS FROM THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
AS NORTHEAST WINDS MODERATE.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...COOLER AIR ADVECTION ACROSS THE WARM GULF WATERS WILL ALLOW 
FOR A DECK OF STRATOCU TO SLIDE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB 
ROUTE THIS MORNING. PERIODIC VFR CEILINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS 
THE ENTIRE ROUTE AS THESE CLOUDS TRAVERSE THE ROUTE FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. NORTHWEST SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND 
TERMINALS WILL INCREASE FROM 10 TO 15 KNOTS THIS MORNING...TO 
BETWEEN 15 AND 20 KNOTS DURING THIS AFTERNOON...SO A SLIGHT 
CROSSWIND CORRECTION MAY BE USED ON ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE THIS 
AFTERNOON.

1005 PM EST SUN NOV 19 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
TEMPERATURES THIS HOUR RANGE FROM 68 DEGREES IN KEY WEST...TO 63 
DEGREES IN NORTH KEY LARGO. DEWPOINTS ALSO RANGED FROM THE MID 50S 
IN THE LOWER KEYS...TO MID 40S IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS. SKIES 
HAVE BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY OVER THE LOWER KEYS...AS CIRRUS HAS BEEN 
STREAMING RAPIDLY EAST NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. WINDS AT THE CMAN PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN 
AVERAGING FROM NORTHWEST TO NORTH NORTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS WITH 
GUSTS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS THIS EVENING. 

THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING DEPICTS A VERY STABLE AND DRY 
ATMOSPHERE...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE OF 0.67 INCHES. IN 
ADDITION...NORTHWEST TO NORTH WINDS OF 10 TO 20 KNOTS ARE EVIDENT 
FROM THE SURFACE TO 750 MB.
 
.FORECAST...
THE ONLY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE CURRENT FORECAST WILL BE TO OPEN A RANGE 
OF TEMPERATURES AND TO SLIGHTLY INCREASE CLOUD COVER. THE UPPER KEYS 
SHOULD REMAIN A BIT COOLER OVERNIGHT UNDER THE SHADOW OF THE 
MAINLAND THAN THE AIRMASS OVER THE LOWER KEYS FROM THE WARMER GULF 
WATERS.  
&&

.MARINE...
MAINLY NORTH WINDS AROUND 15 KNOTS WILL PREVAIL OVERNIGHT. AN 
INCREASE IN NORTHWEST TO NORTH WINDS WILL OCCUR ON MONDAY...WITH 
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO SETTLE IN MONDAY NIGHT.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
400 PM EST SUN NOV 19 2006

...A COOLER THAN NORMAL SPELL IS IN STORE FOR THE KEYS THIS WEEK...
...WINDY CONDITIONS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO SET IN LATE MONDAY AND
CONTINUE THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
...WE MAY SEE LOW TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY MORNING CLOSE TO RECORD 
LOWS FOR THE DATE (NOV. 22)...

.DISCUSSION...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED FROM TEXAS...ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN GULF COAST AND GULF OF MEXICO...TO FLORIDA. THIS IS STILL 
DRYING A DRY, NORTH BREEZE OVER THE KEYS. WIND SPEEDS HAVE COME DOWN 
OVER FLORIDA BAY AND THE UPPER KEYS...INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE...
BUT WINDS ARE STILL CLOSE TO 15 KT ELSEWHERE. GUSTINESS OVER 20 KT
IS OBSERVED AT REEF SITES IN THE LOWER KEYS TO DRY TORTUGAS. SOME
SHIPS IN THE FAR SOUTHWEST STRAITS REPORT HIGHER WINDS NEAR 20 
KT...BUT THESE MAY BE ON ELEVATED SHIP PLATFORMS. KEYS ISLAND TEMPS 
FINALLY HIT 70F...WHILE DEWPOINTS CONTINUE TO DROP INTO THE MID 40S. 
THE DRIER AIR HAVING WORKED DOWN TO LOWER LEVELS HAS DISSIPATED ALL 
CLOUD COVER.

.FORECAST...
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE TO FORECASTS. 

FORECAST TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN REDUCED A DEGREE OR TWO FOR MONDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE STRENGTH AND CONFIGURATION OF HIGH 
LEVEL WINDS MONDAY INTO TUESDAY IS STILL EXPECTED TO CREATE 
SIGNIFICANT JET DYNAMICS...WHICH OUGHT TO CLOUD UP SKIES AND MAYBE 
PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. FINALLY...HIGH PRESSURE PULSES OVER THE 
GULF...AND LOW PRESSURE FORMING OVER THE ATLANTIC E OR NE OF 
FLORIDA...STILL PORTEND AN ONSET OF WINDY CONDITIONS BY MONDAY 
EVENING...BLOWING ON THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MARINERS TAKE NOTE. 

TONIGHT...CLEAR SKIES...LOWER DEWPOINTS...AND OFF-MAINLAND FLOW
DICTATE LOW TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW SUNDAY MORNING. NEAR 60F
LOWS MAY BE A BIT OPTIMISTIC FOR UPPERMOST KEYS. 

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...THIS WILL BE A HAZARDOUS PERIOD FOR ALL 
MARINE OPERATIONS. SEE MARINE SECTION. PULSES OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE GULF MAKE TIMING OF ONSET OF HIGHER WINDS DIFFICULT. I WILL BE
CAREFUL...AND INDICATE BREEZY CONDITIONS BEFORE THE END OF DAY 
MONDAY...BUT CERTAINLY THE PULSE OF STRONGER NW TO N WINDS SHOULD 
AFFECT DRY TORTUGAS AND GULF WATERS EARLIER IN THE DAY. NOW...
LOOKING AT THE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN...STRONG JET DYNAMICS ARE STILL
SHOWN TO QUICKLY UNFOLD OVER THE EASTERN GULF...TRANSLATE SOUTH OVER 
FLORIDA...AND AFFECT THE KEYS BY MONDAY AFTERNOON ON THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT. AS STATED IN EARLIER AFD CONCERNS...LARGE SCALE LIFT MAY 
OVERCOME THE GENERAL CURRENT DRYNESS...PRODUCING STREAKS OF DEEPER 
MOISTURE. THIS PATTERN IS NOW SUGGESTED BY THE LATEST GFS AND NAM 
MODEL RUNS...WITH MOISTURE BULKING UP FROM THE SURFACE TO 700 MB
BY MONDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...MOS POPS ARE HIGHER (40 PCT FOR GFS 
MON NIGHT...40 PCT FOR MON DAYTIME WITH THE NAM AND 30 PCT MON 
NIGHT). I HAVE BOOSTED MON NIGHT POPS TO 30 PCT...AND WILL LET MID 
SHIFT REASSESS POTENTIAL FOR ANY SHOWERS BEFORE MONDAY IS OVER. 
CLOUD COVER DUE TO CIRRUS SHOULD THICKEN QUICKLY MONDAY...THEN
COLD AIR STATUS AND/OR STRATOCU SHOULD MOVE IN MONDAY NIGHT. TEMPS
50 UPPER KEYS...TO 59-60F KEY WEST...IS THE ESTIMATED RANGE FOR MON 
NIGHT. THESE WILL FEEL COLD DUE TO WIND. 

TUE AND TUE NIGHT...LATEST MODELS KEEP A NW COMPONENT TO WIND FLOW...
WITH COLD AIR LOW LEVEL CLOUDS MOVING OFF THE GULF TO THE KEYS. 
UPPER KEYS MIGHT FALL IN SHADOW OF OFF-MAINLAND DRYING LATE TUE OR 
TUE NIGHT.  A FORECAST OF 56F FOR KEY WEST FOR TUE NIGHT (WED 
MORNING) WOULD TIE THE RECORD LOW OF 56F FOR THE DATE...SET IN 1937. 

WED AND WED NIGHT...LATEST GFS DROPS WINDS LATE WED..BUT I WILL
BE CONSERVATIVE WITH THE DOWN TREND. WINDS STILL ARE SHOWN NNW WED...
SO CLOUDS AND LOW POPS ARE RETAINED...BUT OFF-MAINLAND FLOW WED 
NIGHT OUGHT TO CEASE SOME CLOUD PROBLEMS AND SHUT OFF ANY PUNY 
SHOWER CHANCE. 

THU THROUGH FRIDAY...A GRADUAL DROP IN WINDS...A TURN OF WINDS TO 
N-NE BY FRIDAY...AND SOME RECOVERY BY A FEW DEGREES IN TEMPS IS 
EXPECTED...BUT WELL STILL BE BELOW NORMAL TEMPS. 

FRIDAY NIGHT-SUN...NE TO E WINDS...AND SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS 
INDICATED. 10 PCT POPS ARE MENTIONED WITH NOT MUCH CONFIDENCE. 
A MODERATE TEMP TREND IS WELCOME NEWS TO ME. 
&&

.MARINE...
BOATERS...WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO GO NW TO N AND PICK UP DURING MON 
AFTERNOON OVER GULF OF MEXICO WATERS...WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS...AND 
WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST TO DRY TORTUGAS...THEN REACH THE KEYS PROPER 
BY LATE AFTERNOON. HIGH PRESSURE PULSES MAKE TIMING OF WIND INCREASE 
RISKY TO PIN POINT...SO BE PREPARED FOR THIS MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO 
EVENING. MONDAY NIGHT...IT LOOKS LIKE NNW WINDS WILL SURGE HIGHER...
INTO THE 20-25 KT RANGE WITH HIGHER GUSTS...AND SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE POSTED. NOAA WAVE WATCH MODELING SHOWS
THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO AFFECTED BY 10-15 FT WAVES LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT ON THROUGH TUESDAY INTO TUE NIGHT.

REAL IMPROVEMENT IS NOT EXPECTED UNTIL MAYBE WED NIGHT OR THU. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB 
ROUTE...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. SURFACE WINDS WILL BE NORTHWEST 
TO NORTH AT LESS THAN 10 KT AT KMTH...AND AT KEYW 11-14 KT WITH 
OCCASIONAL HIGHER GUSTS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...THEN 
DIMINISHING TO LESS THAN 10 KT TONIGHT. THIS WILL RESULT IN 
INTERMITTENT PERIODS OF 10 KT OR GREATER CROSSWINDS AT KEYW AT LEAST 
THROUGH SUNSET.

340 AM EST SUN NOV 19 2006

.DISCUSSION...
LARGE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS ACROSS THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE 
COUNTRY...WITH A RELATIVELY SHALLOW NORTHERLY FLOW CONTINUING TO 
EXTEND ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS THIS MORNING. EARLY MORNING 
SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW SHALLOW CU IN THE GULF BEYOND 60 NM OF THE 
SOUTWESTERN MAINLAND COUNTIES. AC PATCHES REMAIN SOUTH OF A DRY 
TORTUGAS TO MARQUESAS KEYS LINE WITH LITTLE OVERALL TRANSLATION 
EASTWARD OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MIDDLE 60S 
ALONG THE ISLANDS WITH A MODERATE NORTH WIND...AND DEWPOINTS RANGE 
FROM THE UPPER 40S AT EYW TO THE LOWER 50S FURTHER UP THE ISLAND 
CHAIN. KBYX IS VOID OF ANY PRECIPITATION ECHOES.

.FORECAST...
THE LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE CLOSER TO THE GULF COAST 
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. ALSO...A STRENGTHENING TROUGH WILL DIG 
AND CLOSE OFF NEAR THE SOUTHEAST COAST BY EARLY TUESDAY. THE 
RESULTANT SURFACE EVOLUTION REMAINS COMPLEX NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF 
THE BAHAMAS...AND THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE NOT BEING CONSISTENT 
WITH THE PLACEMENT AND STRENGTH OF THE LOWER PRESSURES THE LAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS. BUT AS WE HAVE BEEN SAYING THROUGHOUT...THE IMPACTS 
FOR THE KEYS REMAINS THE SAME WITH COOLER AND WINDY CONDITIONS 
STARTING LATE MONDAY...LASTING THROUGH TUESDAY AND CONTINUING 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE GFS IS CONTINUING TO SHOW THE LOWEST 
TEMPERATURES FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD FROM TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY MORNING...53F FOR EYW. THAT WOULD BE A RECORD IF THE TREND 
SOLIDIFIES. MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR THE DAYTIME HIGHS BOTH TUESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY HAVE LOST A DEGREE FROM THE PREVIOUS SOLUTION. 
SO...REGARDLESS OF THE ACTUAL NUMBERS...THE LOCAL AREA WILL BE 
FEELING SOME UNSEASONABLY COOL CONDITIONS. ALTHOUGH THE LATEST RUN 
OF THE GFS CLOSES OFF A MID LEVEL LOW SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTHEAST OF 
PREVIOUS RUNS...IT CONTINUES TO WRAP AROUND SIGNIFICANT ENERGY LOBES 
ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS FROM MONDAY NIGHT ALL THE WAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY MORNING BEFORE LIFTING OUT TO THE NORTHEAST...ALL UNDER A 
STRONG AND ELONGATING JET THAT WILL EXTEND FROM THE SOUTHEASTERN 
GULF WAY INTO THE CANADIAN MARITIMES. ALTHOUGH MOISTURE WILL BE 
LIMITED...FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO KEEP AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS DURING THOSE PERIODS. THIS IS WELL BELOW THE GFS 
NUMBERS...WHICH ARE IN THE HIGH CHANCE RANGE THANKS TO EPISODES OF 
AGRESSIVE LOWER LEVEL LIFT ESPECIALLY THROUGH THE TUESDAY TIME 
FRAME. AS FAR AS WINDS ARE CONCERNED...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL 
BE MADE TO ANY OF THOSE GRIDS THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE FORECAST. 
EXPECT BREEZY CONDITIONS MONDAY...BECOMING WINDY MONDAY NIGHT AND 
LASTING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AND THEN BEGINNING TO TAPER OFF LATE 
ON WEDNESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE FINALLY REBUILDING ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA 
AND A FLATTENING MID TO UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL HELP MODERATE 
CONDITIONS BACK TOWARDS SEASONAL VALUES LATE NEXT WEEK. WINDS MAY 
SURGE AGAIN ON SATURDAY...BUT FROM A MORE TEMPERATE NORTHEASTERLY 
DIRECTION. NO CHANGES TO ANY OF THE LATE PERIOD GRIDS.

SATELLITE WATER VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOW DRY AIR ALOFT 
HAVING FINALLY SWEPT OVER THE KEYS...ENDING THE FLOW OF HIGH CLOUDS.
THE MORNING SOUNDING AT KEY WEST REVEALED MOIST LAYERS BELOW 10 THSD 
FT (A STRATOCUMULUS CLOUD LAYER 5-6 THSD FT AND A MID CLOUD LAYER
NEAR 10 THSD FT)...AND THESE CLOUDS ARE CURRENTLY STILL MOVING OVER 
ALL THE KEYS EXCEPT FOR THE EXTREME LOWER KEYS...KEY WEST TO 
SUGARLOAF KEY...WHERE THE CLOUD FLOW HAS RECENTLY SHUT OFF AND 
SUNSHINE HAS RETURNED. A WIND SURGE HAS PUMPED AREA NNE WINDS UP 
INTO THE 15-20 KT RANGE AT LOCAL ISLAND AND MARINE ENVIRONMENT 
GAUGES...WITH GUSTS UP TO 25 KT AT SAND KEY C-MAN. A SUBTLE 
TROUGH-LIKE TURN OF WINDS IS SEEN IN THE SURFACE ANALYSIS...
EXTENDING FROM THE KEYS NW OVER THE GULF. THIS FEATURE IS 
ACCOMPANIED BY A LAYER OF STRATOCU CLOUDS OUT OVER THE GULF...AND
HAS MOVED SSW FROM THE NE GULF WHERE IT WAS LOCATED YESTERDAY 
AFTERNOON. SHOWERS IN THE FAR EASTERN FLORIDA STRAITS ARE GRADUALLY
MOVING EAST. TEMPERATURES IN THE KEY HAVE MOVED UP INTO THE LOWER 
70S SO FAR. 

.FORECAST...
THE LOWER KEYS HAVE ALREADY LOST THE MAIN CLOUD COVER...AND A GRADUAL
THINNING OF CLOUDS IS STILL EXPECTED TO WORK EAST OVER ALL THE KEYS. 
AN UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES WILL BE MADE AT NOON FOR SKY TRANSITION...
AND INDICATE A BIT MORE BREEZE FOR THE AFTERNOON.

SHOWED 20 KT WINDS OUT IN THE STRAITS OFF THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS
AT 642 AM. OVERALL WINDS WILL PROBABLY PULSE UP AND DOWN DUE TO COOL 
AIR ADVECTION...BUT MAINLY STAY AROUND THE 15 KT MARK WITH THOSE

.DISCUSSION...
SATELLITE WATER VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOW EVEN DRIER AIR 
ALOFT SWOOPING IN FROM THE WEST AND OVER THE KEYS. A STRATOCUMULUS 
CLOUD LAYER BASED AT 6 THSD FT AGL KEEPS FORMING OVER THE KEYS...
MAINLY MID AND UPPER KEYS AT THIS TIME BENEATH AN ELEVATED INVERSION 
AND UNDER THE DRYING ALOFT. WINDS FROM THE NORTH HAVE SUBSIDED OVER 
THE UPPER KEYS AND FLORIDA BAY AS ANTICIPATED WITH HEATING OF THE 
MAINLAND...NOW NEAR 10 KT AT THOSE SITES. WINDS ARE CLOSER TO 15 KT 
ELSEWHERE. TEMPS FINALLY GOT INTO MID 70S RANGE FOR A WHILE...AND
DEWPOINTS CONTINUE TO DROP...NOW IN THE MID 50S. 

.FORECAST...
MODELS ARE SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO PLACEMENT AND 
EVOLUTION OF A LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE ATLANTIC MONDAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...BUT THE SIZE OF THE SYSTEM REMAINS SUCH THAT
THE EXPECTED IMPACT ON THE KEY REMAINS THE SAME...WINDY AND MUCH 
COOLER STARTING LATE MONDAY...THROUGH TUESDAY...INTO WEDNESDAY. 

LATEST GFS MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS FOR TEMPERATURE HAVE A LOW IN KEY 
WEST OF 53F FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING AND A HIGH WEDNESDAY OF 67F.
THE RECORD MINIMUM TEMPERATURE IN KEY WEST FOR THAT DATE...NOV 22..
IS 56F SET IN 1937...AND THE RECORD COLD MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE IS 66F 
SET IN 1944. THIS FORECAST PACKAGE WILL INDICATE TEMPERATURES JUST A 
DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE THESE NUMBERS.

TONIGHT...NORTH WINDS IN THE 10-15 MPH RANGE ARE INDICATED...BUT AS 
THE MAINLAND COOLS WE MAY SEE A SURGE LATER ON. THIS WILL BE OF 
MAINLY A CONCERN TO BOATERS. MODELS INDICATE THAT PATCHY STRATOCU 
CLOUDS MAY MOVE IN FROM THE NNW AROUND THE 850 MB LEVEL...MAINLY
AFFECTING THE LOWER KEYS LATER TONIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME...DRIER AIR 
AN LOWER LEVELS IS SHOWN TO MOVE OFF THE MAINLAND TO THE UPPER AND 
MID KEYS. LOWS IN THE 60-65F RANGE ARE FORECAST BY ALL MOS...AND 
THIS WILL BE MAINTAINED. 

SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...A CONTINUED NORTH WIND FLOW AT LOWER 
LEVELS PROMISES TO GIVE DRY AIR AT LOWER LEVELS...AND HOPEFULLY 
SUPPRESS MOST CLOUD COVER. SOME COOL ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE...
SO A BIT LOWER MAX AND MIN TEMPS ARE INDICATED. 

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...MODELS REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH FORECAST OF 
VERY STRONG WINDS ALOFT...200-300 MB...WITH THE JET SINKING SOUTH 
OVER FLORIDA. WINDS 130 KT OR MORE SHOULD SETTLE SOUTH OVER FLORIDA 
DURING THE DAY...PLACING THE KEYS UNDER STRONG JET DYNAMICS AND HIGH 
LEVEL LIFT BY AFTERNOON INTO EVENING. MODELS MAINTAIN DRY AIR ABOVE 
5 THSD FT AGL EXCEPT FOR A LAYER OF JET-RELATED CIRRUS THAT WILL 
OVER SWEEP THE KEYS. THE PROBLEM CONTINUES WHETHER LARGE SCALE LIFT 
MAY OVERCOME THE DRYNESS WITH ISOLATED SWATHS OF DEEPER MOISTURE 
BENEATH THE LIFT REGION...AND GIVE SHOWERS OR EVEN ISOLATED THUNDER 
FOR THE KEYS. I AN MAINTAINING 20 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AT THIS 
TIME. SURFACE WINDS SHOULD GO NNW AND INCREASE MONDAY 
AFTERNOON...WITH WINDY CONDITIONS MON NIGHT AS LOW PRESSURE STARTS 
EAST OF FLORIDA AND HIGH PRESSURE SURGES SE OVER THE GULF. 
ISALLOBARIC FLOW MAKING LOW LEVELS BACK TO NNW MAY ALSO BRING COLD 
AIR LOW CLOUDS INTO THE KEYS...BUT FOR NOW PARTLY CLOUDY WILL BE THE 
SKY COVER TERM. 

TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AS STATED ABOVE...COLD AIR ADVECTION IS 
STILL EXPECTED AND TUESDAY NIGHT (WED MORNING) LOWS MAY BE CLOSE TO 
RECORD LOWS FOR THE DAY. WIND WILL REMAIN STRONG...20-25 MPH AND 
GUSTY OVER ISLANDS. I WILL MAINTAIN 20 PCT POPS FOR SHOWERS...BUT
LATEST GFS RUN (AND THE PREVIOUS ONE AS WELL) HAVE SHIFTED THE 
EXTREME COLD POOL ALOFT FARTHER NORTH RATHER THAN SINKING IT TO 
SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE BAHAMAS. AS A RESULT SHOWERS MAY CUT OFF
BY TUESDAY NIGHT IF LOWER LEVEL WINDS GO MORE NORTHERLY OFF THE 
MAINLAND. 

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BECAUSE THE ATLANTIC LOW CENTER IS 
FORECAST TO START FARTHER NORTH...AND MOVE AWAY SOONER TO THE NE...
LATEST GFS MODEL HAS WINDS STARTING TO DROP IN SPEED. I AM BEING A 
BIT CONSERVATIVE WITH THE WIND DROP OFF WED. AT ANY RATE...A ROUGH
DAY FOR MARINERS IS PROBABLY STILL IN STORE FOR WED.

THU THROUGH SAT...HIGH PRESSURE IS FORECAST TO EASE EASTWARD OVER 
THE SOUTHLAND...WITH KEYS WINDS DROPPING IN SPEED THU AND TURNING TO 
NE THEN E DURING THIS PERIOD...EXCEPT THAT WIND SPEEDS MAY ACTUALLY
INCREASE AGAIN BY SAT IF THE HIGH TO OUR NORTH EXPANDS AS SHOWN BY 
THE GFS MODEL. 
&&

.MARINE...
NORTH WINDS 10-15 KT TONIGHT AND SUN MAY PULSE CLOSER TO 15 KT AT 
TIMES DUE TO SOME PRESSURE FLUCTUATIONS OVER THE MAINLAND. 

A STRONG BLOW IS STILL EXPECTED TO SET IN STARTING PROBABLY MONDAY 
AFTERNOON...WITH NNW WINDS IN THE 20-25 KT RANGE AND GUSTY BY MONDAY 
NIGHT CONTINUING THROUGH TUE NIGHT. NEEDLESS TO SAY...SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY FLAGS WILL FLY DURING THIS TIME. QUITE HIGH SEAS WILL BE 
GENERATED IN THE STRAITS...AND THE WHOLE GULF OF MEXICO MAY SEE 
SWELLS 10 FT AND HIGHER BY MON NIGHT THROUGH TUE NIGHT. 

A TURN OF WINDS TO NE THEN E...WITH SPEEDS DOWN TO 15 KT...IS 
EXPECTED BY THURSDAY. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS THROUGH TONIGHT. A FEW VFR CEILINGS BASED 
AROUND 6000-7000 FT AGL WILL AFFECT THE ROUTE THIS EVENING...ENDING 
EARLY TONIGHT. SURFACE WINDS WILL BE MAINLY NORTH...AT KMTH 10 KT OR 
LESS AND AT KEYW 12-15 KT WITH OCCASIONAL HIGHER GUSTS THIS

KBYX RADAR SHOWS AN AREA OF LIGHT RAIN OR SHOWERS IN THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS BEYOND 30 NM OF THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS...AND EVEN MORE 
ISOLATED ECHOES BEYOND THE ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT TO THE LOWER 
KEYS. OTHERWISE...EARLY MORNING IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOWS SOME 
EROSION IN THE LAYERED CLOUDS ALONG AND TO THE N/NW OF THE ISLANDS. 
WINDS ARE GENTLE TO MODERATE OUT OF THE NORTH/NORTHEAST ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE SERVICE AREA.

.FORECAST...
THE MID TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS WILL EVENTUALLY TRANSLATE EAST OF 
OUR LONGITUDE TODAY...ALLOWING FOR SOME SINKING OF DRIER AIR FOR 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON ALL THE WAY THROUGH EARLY MONDAY MORNING. SOME 
RESIDUAL MOISTURE BETWEEN 3 TO 6 KFT WILL BE GLIDING OVER THE ISLAND 
CHAIN AND GULF WATERS BEFORE THE ONSET OF DRIER INTRUSION. NOT VERY 
CONFIDENT IN EVEN A LIGHT SPRINKLE FOR THOSE AREAS...ESPECIALLY 
LOOKING AT THE RADAR TREND OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. SO WILL 
REMOVE ANY MENTION IN THE SHORT TERM OF THE FORECAST AND INDICATE A 
DECREASE IN OVERALL CLOUD COVER THIS AFTERNOON. BY MONDAY...A TROUGH 
DIGS THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST STATES INTO FLORIDA AND SURFACE PRESSURES 
DROP IN A COMPLEX PATTERN EAST OF FLORIDA NEAR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. 
THE JET DYNAMICS WILL BE ENOUGH TO WORK ON THE LIMITED MOISTURE FOR 
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. ALTHOUGH THE 
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THE GENERAL EVOLUTION 
OF THIS SYSTEM EARLY NEXT WEEK...SPECIFICS CONTINUE TO BE HARD TO 
PIN DOWN. THE MID LEVEL INTRUSION OF LOW TEMPERATURES IS NOWHERE 
NEAR AS DRASTIC AS DEPICTED BY THE MODELS OVER THE PAST 2 DAYS. H5 
TEMPERATURES ARE NOW ONLY -14C OVER KEYW FOR A SHORT WHILE ON 
TUESDAY AS OPPOSED TO -23C OR SO PREVIOUSLY INDICATED. 
ANYWAY...EXPECT BREEZY TO WINDY CONDITIONS TO BECOME ESTABLISHED 
DURING THAT TIME...AND THEN EASING OFF FROM THE DAYTIME HOURS OF 
WEDNESDAY ONWARD AS THE LOW IN THE ATLANTIC BEGINS TO PULL OUT. 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE COOLEST TEMPERATURES EARLY 
TUESDAY MORNING AND ONLY SLIGHTLY WARMER WEDNESDAY MORNING. DAYTIME 
TEMPERATURES WILL HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME BREAKING THE 70 DEGREE MARK 
BOTH DAYS. MODERATING PARAMETERS ARE EXPECTED THURSDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY...BUT STILL SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW SEASONAL AVERAGES. WILL 
LEAVE THE SMALLEST MENTION OF SHOWERS IN THE LATE PORTIONS OF THE

.MARINE...
HIGHER SWELLS IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS WEST OF THE KEYS WILL CONTINUE

WINDS OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS WHEN COMPARED TO GUIDANCE FROM 
YESTERDAY...BUT BY A MATTER OF 5 KNOTS OR SO. IT SHOULD BE A 
RELATIVELY NICE BOATING WEEKEND BEFORE CONDITIONS BEGIN TO 
DETERIORATE. ALTHOUGH THE LOWER PRESSURE DEVELOPING EAST OF FLORIDA 
MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY IS NOT AS CONSOLIDATED AS YESTERDAY...SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS WILL MORE THAN LIKELY BE NECESSARY FROM 
LATE MONDAY INTO AT LEAST THE SECOND HALF OF THE WORK WEEK.

THE COLD FRONT HAS MOVED PAST KEY WEST THIS PAST HOUR...TURNING

AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY THAT FORMED FROM THE MORNING CONVECTION S AND W 
OF KEY WEST...WHICH BLEW EAST OVER THE KEYS AND HAS SPARKED A LINE

UNUSUAL FORECAST PATTERN INDICATED BY MODELS THROUGH THE COMING

MOS. I HAVE LOWERED POPS TO 40 PCT...MAINTAINING MENTION OF THUNDER 
OVER THE AREA TONIGHT DUE TO INSTABILITY. THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
MODELS WIDENS FRI AND FRI NIGHT...AS THE GFS MAINTAINS DEEP MOISTURE 
AND ISENTROPIC LIFT 850 MB AND UPWARDS...THUS HIGH POPS OF 50-60 PCT 
WHILE NAM MOS IS 20 PCT. THE NORTH WINDS ARE FORECAST TO BE VERY 
SHALLOW...SFC TO 3 THSD FT AGL...SO I WILL MAINTAIN 30 PCT POPS IN 
ONGOING FORECASTS...AND MENTION THUNDER FOR THE STRAITS WHERE 
FORECAST LIFTED INDEX VALUES ARE LOW. 

SAT...EVEN GFS HAS DRYING FINALLY SETTING IN BY MID DAY...SO I WILL 
INDICATE MORNING CHANCE OF RAIN...30 PCT PER GFS MODEL. NORTH WINDS 
PERIST DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NW GULF AREA.

SAT NIGHT THROUGH SUN NIGHT...DRIER AIR ALOFT AND AT LOWER LEVELS
OUGHT TO LEAD TO LOW OR NO POPS...AND LESS CLOUDS. COOLING AT NIGHT 
TO MID OR LOWER 60S...DAY TIME MAX TEMPS MID 70S...IS REASONABLE. 

MON THROUGH THU...A MOST EXTRAORDINARY UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE AREA

COLD TEMPS AT 500 MB FOR THIS AREA...MINUS 18 TO MINUS 22 CELCIUS. 
A STRONG SURFACE SURGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS INDICATED TO PUSH OVER

NORTH OF THE BAHAMAS, EAST OF FLORIDA...WHIPPING NW TO N WINDS OVER 
THE REGION. I WILL INDICATE COOLER TEMPS...20 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
MON-TUE...AND BREEZY CONDITIONS...BUT ALL THIS MAY NEED UPGRADING TO 
COOLER AND STRONGER WINDS...MAYBE HIGHER THREAT OF RAIN AND EVEN 
THUNDER AT SOME POINT DURING THIS PERIOD.

MODERATE TO FRESH SOUTH BREEZES HAVE TRANSPORTED MARITIME TROPICAL
AIR TO THE KEYS. CURRENT AIR TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING NEAR 80F AT
THIS EARLY HOUR...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. KEY WEST DOPPLER
RADAR SCANS SHOW A SOLID BAND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE
SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO MOVING TOWARD THE FLORIDA KEYS AND
ADJOINING WATERS FROM THE WEST. THIS BAND OF SHOWERS AND STORMS LIES
JUST AHEAD OF A SURFACE TROUGH LINE...WHICH IN TURN...LIES JUST
AHEAD OF A WIND SHIFT AND COLD FRONT. THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE CYCLONE
IS NOW CENTERED NEAR THE INDIANA/KENTUCKY BORDER AND MOVING NORTH-
NORTHEASTWARD. 

LOOK FOR INCREASING CLOUDS THIS MORNING WITH RAIN AND STORMS BY ABOUT
NOON IN KEY WEST...3PM IN MARATHON AND 5PM IN THE UPPER KEYS. RAIN
WILL PROBABLY END THIS EVENING OVER THE ISLANDS...BUT LINGER ACROSS
THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA AS THE FRONTAL ZONE GRADUALLY MOVES EAST AND
SOUTH OF THE AREA. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO NORTHWEST AND A CHANGE IN AIR
MASS WILL DEFINITELY BE NOTICEABLE BY FRIDAY MORNING. CLOUDS WILL
HANG AROUND THROUGH MOST OF FRIDAY BECAUSE THE MID-TROPOSPHERIC
TROUGH AXIS WILL REMAIN WEST OF THE SERVICE AREA UNTIL SATURDAY
MORNING. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF STRATIFORM RAIN...AROUND 20- 30
PERCENT...FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...AND THIS HAS BEEN INDICATED IN
ALL FORECASTS. BY SATURDAY NIGHT...IT SHOULD CLEAR OUT...WITH EVEN
COOLER TEMPERATURES BY SUNDAY MORNING.

BEYOND SUNDAY...THERE IS LESS CONFIDENCE IN THE FORECAST DUE TO
UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER-AIR PATTERN AND EFFECTS ON
THE SURFACE WEATHER ELEMENTS. IT DOES APPEAR SOMEWHAT LIKELY THAT
NORTH WINDS WILL INCREASE ON MONDAY OWING TO A TIGHTENING MSL
PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN A BUILDING SURFACE ANTICYCLONE OVER THE
EASTERN UNITED STATES AND A DEVELOPING GALE OFFSHORE THE EASTERN
SEABOARD. THE WIND SURGE COULD EXTEND INTO MID-WEEK WITH EVEN
STRONGER WINDS POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON HOW THE PATTERN EVOLVES.
&&

.MARINE...
SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION TODAY AS FRESH BREEZES WILL BLOW
AT TIMES FROM THE SOUTH...SOUTHWEST...WEST...AND THEN NORTHWEST.
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AND MOVE EAST ACROSS THE
AREA...ESPECIALLY AFTER 12 NOON. SOME OF THE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING FREQUENT LIGHTNING AND GUSTY WINDS IN EXCESS OF
40 KNOTS. BE ALERT FOR SPECIAL MARINE WARNINGS. WINDS SHOULD SETTLE
TO NORTHWEST-NORTH NEAR 15KT TONIGHT. 

NEAR-GALE NORTHWESTERLIES ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO HAVE
PRODUCED WAVES WHICH WILL TRAVEL TO OUR WESTERN MARINE ZONES BY
FRIDAY MORNING...EVOLVING IN TO AN 8-9 SECOND 6-8-FOOT SWELL FROM
THE WEST AND NORTHWEST. THIS IS NOT ESPECIALLY STEEP...BUT COMBINED
WITH 3-5FT WIND WAVES COMING OUT OF DUE NORTH...WILL RESULT IN
MODERATELY CONFUSED SEAS...ESPECIALLY IN REBECCA CHANNEL.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH ABOUT 18Z (200 PM) ALONG THE 
KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS.

A SURFACE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWS A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE
AXIS OVER PORTIONS OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST GULF OF
MEXICO. MEANWHILE...A DEEPENING 991MB CYCLONE WAS CENTERED OVER
SOUTHWESTERN ARKANSAS...MOVING EAST. THE KEY WEST TUESDAY EVENING
SOUNDING HAD REVEALED 24-HOUR GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS OF 20-50M
THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN...SENSING THE CHANGE IN
ENVIRONMENT ASSOCIATED WITH A VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY
DIGGING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. VERY DRY AIR WAS STILL PRESENT IN
THE 1000-850MB LAYER AT SOUNDING TIME...AND GPS-MET SENSORS ACROSS
THE KEYS INDICATE ONLY A SLIGHT INCREASE IN TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER
VALUES OVERNIGHT. WE HAVE YET TO COME UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE LOW-
LEVEL THETA E-ADVECTION REGIME ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEVELOPING CYCLONE
TO THE NORTHWEST...BUT THIS SHOULD CHANGE LATER TODAY.

SOUTHEAST WINDS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS MOST OF THE UPPER KEYS AND
ADJOINING WATERS...WITH AIR TEMPERATURES AT MOLASSES REEF AND KEY
LARGO IN THE UPPER 70S. HOWEVER...IN THE LOWER KEYS...CLOSER TO THE
RIDGE...WINDS HAVE BEEN LIGHT AND VARIABLE SO FAR...ALLOWING
TEMPERATURES TO RADIATE TO THE MID OR UPPER 60S. SOUTHEAST BREEZES
AND WARMER TEMPERATURES SHOULD OVERTAKE THE ENTIRE ARCHIPELAGO WITHIN
THE NEXT FEW HOURS...OR CERTAINLY AFTER SUNRISE. KEY WEST DOPPLER
RADAR SCANS HAVE DETECTED RAIN SHOWERS IN THE SERVICE AREA FOR THE
FIRST TIME IN ALMOST A WEEK. MOST OF THE SHOWERS ARE MOVING NORTHWEST
AT 10KT EAST OF LINE FROM FLAMINGO TO MARATHON TO VARADERO CUBA...
WITHIN THE MORE ESTABLISHED SOUTHEAST LOW-LEVEL FLOW.

TODAY WILL FEATURE A TRANSITION TO A RETURN FLOW REGIME WITH
WARMER...MORE HUMID CONDITIONS AND FRESHENING SOUTHEAST BREEZES. BY
THE END OF DAY...THE AIR MASS SHOULD BE DECIDEDLY MARITIME TROPICAL.
ALTHOUGH A SURFACE CYCLONE WILL BE EVOLVING PRETTY FAR NORTH OF THE
KEYS...OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY...ITS INTENSITY AND
EXPANSE SHOULD ENSURE THAT A WEAK LOW-LEVEL WARM ADVECTION PATTERN
TAKES HOLD WITH A WARMING AND MOISTENING LOWER TROPOSPHERE AND A
SLIGHT COOLING IN THE MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE. ISOLATED SHOWERS TODAY WILL
LIKELY INCREASE TO SCATTERED COVERAGE BY LATER TONIGHT. 

AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT THURSDAY WILL LIKELY BE PRECEDED BY A LINE
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. TIMING IS STILL A LITTLE TRICKY...BUT A
PLAUSIBLE SCENARIO FOR THE MIDDLE KEYS WOULD BE THE FOLLOWING:
BECOMING CLOUDY BEFORE NOON...RAIN BY 3PM...WIND SHIFT TO NORTHWEST
BY 7PM...SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER AIR BY MIDNIGHT. SUBTRACT 2-3
HOURS FOR THE LOWER KEYS...AND ADD 2-3 HOURS FOR THE UPPER KEYS. BY
FRIDAY MORNING...A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED
STATES WILL BE PUMPING COOLER AND DRIER AIR SOUTHWARD IN THE LOW
LEVELS DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND INTO THE KEYS. HOWEVER...AT
HIGHER LEVELS...SOME MOISTURE AND CLOUDS WILL LIKELY LINGER...WITH
MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS AND A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS THROUGH FRIDAY
NIGHT. COOL...CONTINENTAL AIR WILL CONTINUE OOZING SOUTH INTO THE
SERVICE AREA EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH LITTLE CHANCE FOR RAIN.
&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION STATEMENT WILL PROBABLY BE REQUIRED
FOR WINDS AND SEAS TONIGHT...AS SOUTH BREEZES FRESHEN IN ADVANCE OF
AN APPROACHING TROUGH AND COLD FRONT. HOWEVER...WE DO NOT EXPECT
SUSTAINED WINDS TO EXCEED 20KT...ALTHOUGH GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 20KT ARE
CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. IN ADDITION...WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE HIGHER
LOCALLY AROUND NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY
AND THURSDAY NIGHT. WE DO NOT ANTICIPATE A HUGE POST-FRONTAL BLOW
OVER THE WEEKEND AS IS COMMON WITH SOME FRONTS. HOWEVER...THERE ARE
SOME INDICATIONS THAT WINDS MAY FRESHEN TO NEAR 20KT EARLY NEXT

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST MONDAY EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED 24-HOUR GEOPOTENTIAL
HEIGHT FALLS THROUGHOUT THE COLUMN...AS WELL AS A LOSS OF 2MB AT THE
SURFACE. THE RIDGE THAT HAS EXTENDED NORTH FROM A DEEP LAYERED
CENTRAL AMERICAN/CARIBBEAN ANTICYCLONE IS BEGINNING TO BREAK DOWN AS
THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN TRANSFORMS ACROSS MIDLATITUDE NORTH AMERICA. A
STRONG SUBTROPICAL JET WHICH HAD BEEN PERSISTENT ACROSS THE NORTHERN
GULF BASIN AT 200MB DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS HAS SHIFTED SOUTHWARD
WITH EVEN MORE ABUNDANT CIRRUS/CIRROSTRATUS COVERAGE ACROSS THE
SERVICE AREA THAN AS OF LATE. IN ADDITION...WESTERLIES FROM 500MB UP
HAVE GRADUALLY INCREASED IN SPEED...WITH FAST-MOVING PERTURBATIONS
BRINGING EPISODES OF HIGH-ALTOCUMULUS CEILINGS. A THICK PATCH OF
ALTOCUMULUS IS TRAVELING OVERHEAD AT THE MOMENT. IN THE LOW LEVELS...
THE FLOW IS QUITE WEAK...WITH SFC-700MB LAYER MEAN WIND OF LESS THAN
10KT. CURRENT DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW NO SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION
ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA. HOWEVER...RADAR LOOPS DO SHOW HIGH-FLYING
ALTOCUMULUS AND CIRRUS AT LONG RANGE...AS WELL AS A CUMULUS CLOUD
LINE OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA. THIS LINE APPARENTLY DEMARCATES
NORTH WINDS FROM NORTHEAST WINDS IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE. CURRENT
AIR TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING IN THE LOWER 70S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE
MID 60S...VERY SIMILAR TO THE LAST FEW MORNINGS. THE ATMOSPHERE
REMAINS CAPPED TO CONVECTION ACROSS THE KEYS...WITH VERY DRY AND WARM
AIR STILL EVIDENT BETWEEN 900-700MB.

FORECASTS REQUIRED A FEW ADJUSTMENTS...BUT THE OVERALL REASONING IS
SIMILAR TO THE LAST SEVERAL CYCLES. IN THE SHORT TERM...MOSTLY CLOUDY
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT LEAST THIS MORNING DUE TO THE ABUNDANT
CIRRUS AND ALTOCUMULUS DECKS PASSING BY ALOFT. A FAIRLY WEAK MSL
PRESSURE PATTERN WILL PERSIST...AND A LIGHT NORTH WIND FLOW IS
LIKELY AT THE SURFACE THROUGH THE DAY...PERHAPS BECOMING LIGHT AND
VARIABLE THIS EVENING. TONIGHT...STRONG GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS
ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG JET STREAK/SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL INDUCE
INTENSE SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE ARKLATEX REGION...WITH
FRONTOGENESIS ALONG THE TEXAS COASTAL PLAIN. BY EARLY WEDNESDAY...
THIS CYCLONE WILL INTENSIFY AS IT MOVES NORTHEAST...WITH SOUTH
FLORIDA AND THE KEYS AT THE SOUTHERN EXTENT OF A LOW-LEVEL WARM-
ADVECTION REGIME. WEAK ASCENT SHOULD ALLOW BOTH BOUNDARY LAYER AIR
MASS MODIFICATION TO MARITIME TROPICAL AND MID-TROPOSPHERIC COOLING
DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY...SO THAT BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE
ATMOSPHERE WILL BECOME CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE. THIS IS WHEN THE
SHOWER CHANCES WILL START GOING UP. MEANWHILE...THE OCCLUDING SURFACE
CYCLONE WILL CONTINUE ON A NORTHEAST PATH...WITH THE ASSOCIATED COLD
FRONT MOVING RAPIDLY SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE
BEST BET FOR A FRONTAL PASSAGE THROUGH THE KEYS APPEARS TO BE
THURSDAY AFTERNOON. EVEN THOUGH STRONG ASCENT WILL REMAIN WELL NORTH
OF THE KEYS...A NARROW ZONE OF STRONG LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE IN
ADVANCE OF THE FRONT WORKING ON A TROPICAL AIR MASS SHOULD RESULT IN
A LINEAR CONVECTIVE SYSTEM WHICH WILL LIKELY MOVE THROUGH THE KEYS
THURSDAY. THUS...RAIN CHANCES HAVE BEEN BUMPED UP TO 50 PERCENT AND
MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED FURTHER BY THE NEXT FORECASTER. 

BEYOND THURSDAY...THE FORECAST BECOMES MORE UNCERTAIN. AT THIS
POINT...NUMERICAL MODELS ARE SHOWING A SURFACE FRONTAL PASSAGE
THROUGH THE KEYS WAY BEFORE THE THE TROUGH AXIS ALOFT...RESULTING IN
POSSIBLE LINGERING CLOUDS AND RAIN THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
NIGHT. EVENTUALLY...CONDITIONS SHOULD CLEAR OUT BY LATE IN THE
WEEKEND...BUT FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS LOW BEYOND THURSDAY.
&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT NORTH BREEZES TODAY WILL BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE THIS EVENING
AND THEN SHIFT TO EAST TONIGHT. WINDS WILL VEER TO SOUTHEAST
WEDNESDAY AND SOUTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHILE GRADUALLY FRESHENING.
THURSDAY SHOULD START WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS...WHICH WILL SHIFT
NORTHWEST AFTER A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVES THROUGH.
NORTH WINDS WILL THEN SET IN THURSDAY NIGHT...PERSISTING THROUGH THE
WEEKEND. A NORTHWEST SWELL OF AROUND 6FT...PERHAPS HIGHER...SEEMS
INCREASINGLY LIKELY OVER GULF WATERS NORTHWEST THROUGH SOUTHWEST OF
KEY WEST ON FRIDAY.

WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTH NEAR 5 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 
80 DEGREES. ONLY ABOUT ELEVEN DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT 
DUE TO LIGHT NORTH SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...
A WEAK TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS WILL 
DISSIPATE TONIGHT. IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE BAHAMAS 
TUESDAY. IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...ZONAL FLOW IS 
EXPECTED TUESDAY. WARM 850-500MB TEMPERATURES WILL MAINTAIN HIGH 
STATIC STABILITY TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. LACK OF ATMOSPHERIC

WEDNESDAY. DEEPENING EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY WARRANTS DIME POPS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. WINDS SHOULD 
BECOME SOUTHERLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE MOVES 
ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA. PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES SHOULD RISE

AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE TO WARRANT MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY. THE LATEST VERSION OF THE GFS NUMERICAL 
MODEL INDICATES THAT THE TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE MAY NOT PASS THROUGH 
THE KEYS UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS SOLUTION IS SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS 
VERSIONS OF THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE. MORE CONSISTENCY IS 
NEEDED BEFORE JUMPING ON THE SLOWER SOLUTION. IF THE SLOWER SOLUTION

ANALYSIS OF SUNDAY EVENING AND OVERNIGHT UPPER-AIR DATA SHOWS A
SUBTROPICAL JET AT 200MB PERSISTING FROM THE EASTERN NORTH PACIFIC
ACROSS OLD MEXICO AND THE GULF BASIN TO THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC
EAST OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. THE JET HAS RESULTED IN PATCHES OF
CIRRUS/CIRROSTRATUS TRAVERSING THE FLORIDA KEYS OVER THE LAST FEW
DAYS...WITH SOME EVIDENT IN THE CELESTIAL DOME EARLY THIS MORNING AS
WELL. WESTERLIES PREVAIL THROUGH MOST OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER
TROPOSPHERE OVER THE KEYS...WITH NORTH WINDS IN THE LOW LEVELS. A
HIGHLY MODIFIED CONTINENTAL AIR MASS IS IN PLACE ACROSS THE SERVICE
AREA WITH AIR TEMPERATURES HOLDING AROUND 73-74F...AND DEWPOINTS
STEADY NEAR 66-67F. A STRONG SURFACE DEWPOINT GRADIENT WAS ANALYZED
OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA...REPRESENTING WHAT IS LEFT OF AN OLD FRONT.
MEANWHILE...A BROAD BUT WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS SOUTH
FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE GULF OF MEXICO.

FORECAST REASONING IS FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS CYCLES.
SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT WITH
LITTLE OR NO CHANCE OF RAIN...AS ZONAL FLOW PREVAILS ALOFT WITH WARM
850-500MB TEMPERATURES AND HIGH 1000-700MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS
MAINTAINING HIGH STATIC STABILITY. BY WEDNESDAY...A VERY LARGE AND DEEP
MIDLATITUDE CYCLONE WILL BE EVOLVING OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES
WITH DEEP CYCLONIC FLOW AND GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS COMMENCING
ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE ENERGY AND DEEP
FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL REMAIN WELL NORTH OF THE
KEYS...AN INTENSE SURFACE CYCLONE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PRODUCE A
STRONG AREA OF NORTH AND NORTHWEST WINDS ON ITS WESTERN AND SOUTHERN
FLANKS...WHICH WILL ENSURE THAT A COLD FRONT REACHES THE KEYS ON
THURSDAY. THE FACT THAT MOST QUASI-GEOSTROPHIC FORCING REMAINS WELL
NORTH OF THE KEYS WILL PREVENT SIGNIFICANT WARM ADVECTION OR ASCENT
FROM DEVELOPING...AND KEEP BOUNDARY LAYER MOMENTUM WEAK...THEREBY
LIMITING AIR MASS MODIFICATION AS WELL. THE UPSHOT IS THAT THE BEST
CHANCE OF RAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR THURSDAY WILL OCCUR RIGHT ALONG OR
JUST IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING FRONT...WITHIN A NARROW BUT STRONG
LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE ZONE. WE WILL MAINTAIN CURRENT 30 POP FOR
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...WITH A DECREASE TO NEAR ZERO POPS BY

SHIFTING TO NORTHWEST WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE SOMETIME ON THURSDAY.
UNCERTAINTY STILL EXISTS WITH REGARD TO ACTUAL TIMING OF THE FRONT ON
THURSDAY...BUT MODERATE NORTHWEST BREEZES WILL LIKELY SET IN BY
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. AT THIS POINT...THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE
THAT A SMALL CRAFT CAUTION HEADLINE WOULD BE REQUIRED BY THURSDAY
AFTERNOON AND AN EVEN SMALLER CHANCE FOR SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY

.DISCUSSION...
A WEAKENING COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO DRAPE ACROSS FLORIDA...EXTENDING 
FROM NEAR KTIX TO VERY NEAR KTPA AND THEN FURTHER SOUTHWESTWARD INTO 
THE GULF OF MEXICO. CLOSER TO THE KEYS...WINDS ARE ALREADY NORTH 
NEAR 10 KNOTS AT ALL CMAN REPORTING SITES. RADAR IS QUIET WITH A 
RELATIVELY DRY AIRMASS...LIMITED POCKETS OF MOISTURE IN LOWER LEVELS 
BUT SATELLITE SHOWING A FAIR AMOUNT OF UPPER CLOUDS MOVING THROUGH 
THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF TOWARDS SOUTH FLORIDA AND OVER THE KEYS. 
REINFORCING HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXPAND ACROSS NORTH AND CENTRAL 
FLORIDA TODAY. THE EARLY MORNING FORECAST IS IN GOOD SHAPE...WITH 
AFTERNOON HIGH TEMPERATURES RIGHT AROUND 80 DEGREES EXPECTED 
EVERYWHERE. NO UPDATE IS PLANNED.

.MARINE...
A GENTLE NORTH TO NORTHEAST BREEZE WILL REMAIN STEADY TODAY THROUGH 
EARLY MONDAY. NO CHANGES WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE LATE MORNING 
MARINE UPDATE. 

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST 
FLIGHT ROUTE...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. LOCAL PATCHES OF 
LOW VFR TO HIGH MVFR CEILINGS WILL AFFECT THE ROUTE. OTHERWISE LARGE 
SWATHES OF 20KFT BASED CIRRUS WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM EASTWARD 
ACROSS THE ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS ALONG THE KEYS WILL BE MAINLY NORTH 
AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
A SURFACE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWS A WEAKENING COLD FRONT
MOVING ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO. AT 08Z...THE FRONT EXTENDED FROM
NEAR JACKSONVILLE...TO NEAR CEDAR KEY...TO JUST NORTH OF LOOP CURRENT
BUOY 42003...AND SOUTHWESTWARD. A 1027MB HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS
CENTERED OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY...MOVING EASTWARD. THE
EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THIS HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM COMBINED WITH ZONAL
FLOW ALOFT AND A WARM SEA WILL RESULT IN RAPID FRONTOLYSIS DURING THE
NEXT 24 HOURS. LOCALLY...THE MSL PRESSURE PATTERN IS STILL QUITE
WEAK. HOWEVER...A DECIDEDLY NORTH WIND FLOW HAS DEVELOPED IN THE LAST
FEW HOURS...SUGGESTING THAT THE KEYS ARE NOW COMING UNDER THE
INFLUENCE OF THE DISTANT HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM TO OUR NORTH. SURFACE
DEWPOINTS WHICH HAD INCREASED TO NEAR 70F ON SATURDAY HAVE SINCE
DROPPED INTO THE 60S OVER THE ISLANDS. AIR TEMPERATURES ARE HOVERING
AROUND 70F AT MOST ISLAND LOCATIONS. A PERSISTENT SUBTROPICAL JET
STREAM WITH A LARGE SWATH OF STRONG WINDS ALOFT JUST NORTH AND WEST
OF THE KEYS HAS TRANSPORTED PERIODS OF THICK CIRRUS OVER THE SERVICE
AREA DURING THE LAST 48 HOURS. THIS IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE DURING THE
NEXT FEW DAYS AS MODERATE TO STRONG WESTERLIES PREVAIL ALOFT LOCALLY
WITH SMALL-SCALE JET STREAKS PROPAGATING THROUGH THE JET. LATEST KEY
WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW JUST ISOLATED SPRINKLES ALONG THE
SOUTHERN BORDER OF OUR SERVICE AREA ABOUT 60 NAUTICAL MILES SOUTH OF
THE ISLAND CHAIN. THE AIR IN THE 850-700MB LAYER IS VERY DRY AND
WARM AND BOUNDARY LAYER LAPSE RATES ARE QUITE WEAK WITH HIGH STATIC
STABILITY.

FORECAST REASONING IS AGAIN SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS CYCLES. A PLEASANT
AND RAIN-FREE PERIOD IS LIKELY TO CONTINUE TODAY THROUGH MONDAY AS
BOUNDARY LAYER AIR TRAJECTORIES REMAIN ROOTED IN A COOL AND STABLE
AIR MASS. SKIES WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY AND CHANGEABLE MAINLY DUE TO
FAST-MOVING CIRRUS ALOFT. WE WILL NOT HAVE THE ISLAND CUMULUS TODAY
AS WE DID FRIDAY AND SATURDAY BECAUSE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC WINDS WILL
BE OUT OF THE NORTH. DURING THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...A SERIES OF
CYCLONIC VORTICITY MAXIMA WILL SHOOT ACROSS THE ROCKIES...ENERGIZED
BY AN INTENSE JET. BY MID-WEEK...A DEEP CYCLONE WILL BE EVOLVING OVER
THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES...WITH GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS COMMENCING
ACROSS THE GULF BASIN...AND SURFACE FRONTOGENESIS OVER THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS. AN INTENSE...DEEPENING SURFACE CYCLONE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY
WILL TRANSPORT COOL AIR SOUTHWARD IN A HURRY...LEADING TO AN
INCREASING PROBABILITY OF A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE THROUGH THE KEYS ON
THURSDAY. STRONGEST LARGE-SCALE FORCING LOOKS AT THIS POINT TO REMAIN
WELL NORTH OF OUR LATITUDE...BUT THERE WILL TIME FOR AIR MASS
MODIFICATION AND RESULTANT DESTABILIZATION...AND THE FRONT MAY BE
ASSOCIATED WITH A NARROW BUT STRONG LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE ZONE. WE
WILL MAINTAIN A 30 POP FOR THURSDAY...AND RAISE THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
POP TO 30 AS WELL. FOUR DAYS AWAY...THERE IS STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY
REGARDING TIMING AND STRENGTH OF THE FRONT AND ASSOCIATED
THERMODYNAMIC AND KINEMATIC FIELDS.

GENTLE NORTH BREEZES TODAY WILL BECOME GENTLE TO MODERATE NORTHEAST
BY MONDAY...WITH A SLOW VEERING TO SOUTHEAST LATE TUESDAY. A COLD

AT 00Z (7 PM EST) A COLD FRONT EXTENDED FROM THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE 
SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO. AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...A WEAK 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE POKED FROM THE SE GULF...TO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 
FLORIDA KEYS. MEANWHILE...THE WESTERN EXTENSION OF A WEAK ATLANTIC 
RIDGE REACHED TO THE EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA COASTLINE. A COL REGION 
SEPARATING THE TWO WEAK RIDGE AXES LAY NEAR THE MIDDLE-UPPER KEYS 
BOUNDARY. THIS PRESSURE CONFIGURATION HAS GIVEN A LIGHT AND VARIABLE 
WIND PATTERN TO UPPER KEYS ISLANDS..MOSTLY LIGHT ESE WINDS TO UPPER 
KEYS ATLANTIC-SIDE WATERS...WHILE N-NE WINDS UNDER 10 KT HAVE BEEN 
REGISTERED ELSEWHERE OVER THE KEYS. THE KEY WEST AND MIAMI EVENING 
SOUNDINGS WERE LITTLE CHANGED FROM THIS MORNING...BOTH SHOWING 
PRECIPITABLE WATER ONLY 1.1 INCH...WITH SIGNIFICANTLY DRY AIR ABOVE 
THE 4 THSD FT AGL LEVEL. DEWPOINTS REMAIN IN THE UPPER 60S...AND 9 
PM TEMPS WERE IN THE MID 70S. HIGH LEVEL CIRRUS IS STARTING TO 
ENCROACH FROM THE WEST BUT SO FAR IS RATHER THIN OVER THE KEYS...
WHILE LOWER LEVEL CLOUDS ARE FEW. 

.FORECAST...
FORECASTS PARAMETERS AND TRENDS ARE VERIFYING. A SIMPLE UPDATE WILL 
BE MADE TO FRESHEN EVENING WIND TRENDS VERBIAGE.

.DISCUSSION...
PERIODIC LAYERED CLOUDS HAVE PESTERED THE LOWER KEYS SINCE LATE THIS 
MORNING...BUT HAVE THINNED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. THE WEAK 
RESIDUAL LAND CUBAN LAND BREEZE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND GET SHUNTED 
SOUTHWARD IN THE WATERS SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. 
OTHERWISE...KBYX RADAR IS QUIET AND TEMPERATURES HAVE CLIMBED INTO 
THE LOWER 80S AT MOST ISLAND LOCATIONS. WINDS ARE LIGHT TO GENTLE 
OUT OF THE NORTHEAST FROM THE ISLAND CHAIN WESTWARD...AND MORE 
VEERED IN THE EASTERN BAY AND THE BULK OF THE ATLANTIC WATERS.

.FORECAST...
A WEAKENING COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE REGION WILL 
CONTINUE TO DROP ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA BY EARLY TOMORROW...BUT IT 
WILL BE MOISTURE-STARVED BY THE TIME IT REACHES OUR LATITUDE. THIS 
WILL ALLOW JUST A SLIGHTLY DRIER AIRMASS TO FLOW IN AND SUSTAIN A 
PERIOD OF NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING. IN THE 
MIDDLE TO UPPER LEVELS...THE FLOW FLATTENS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
AND WILL GIVE WAY TO A PROGRESSIVE TROUGH CARVING THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN GULF BY THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. FORECAST REASONING HAS NOT 
CHANGED MUCH. WILL KEEP A DRY FORECAST THROUGH SUNDAY AND MONDAY AND 
THEN CONTINUE ONLY A MINIMAL MENTION OF LIGHT SHOWERS FROM MONDAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE LOCAL STEERING FLOW VEERS TO THE 
EAST/SOUTHEAST. LATEST EXTENDED GFS MOS NUMBERS HAVE LATCHED ON TO 
HIGHER POPS DURING THE DAY THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT MOVING 
THROUGH THE GULF AND CENTRAL/SOUTH FLORIDA. I AM NOT CONVINCED OF 
THE LIKELY POP NUMBERS IT IS PRODUCING ON ITS LATEST RUN...NOR THE 
UP-TICK IN STORM CHANCES SINCE THE INSTABILITY SEEMS MARGINAL AND 
FAVORS THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE REGION WELL AHEAD OF THE ACTUAL 
FRONT. ANYWAY...WILL ADD 10 PERCENT TO THE SHOWER CHANCES DURING THE 
DAY THURSDAY ONLY...AND SEE IF LATER MODEL RUNS SUPPORT ANY HIGHER 
NUMBERS. THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK WILL BE DOMINATED BY HIGH 
PRESSURE SETTLING INTO THE NORTHERN GULF REGION...AND COOLER AND 
SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR BEING PUSHED BACK DOWN TO THE LOCAL AREA. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD RUN A COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW SEASONAL AVERAGE 
BOTH DAY AND NIGHT...AND AT THIS TIME I WILL KEEP JUST A SMALL 
MENTION OF LIGHT RAIN FOR LATE NEXT WEEK AND EARLY NEXT WEEKEND.

&&

.MARINE...
WINDS WILL BE LIGHT TO GENTLE THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT...BECOMING 
NORTH ACROSS ALL WATERS. GENTLE TO MODERATE NORTHEAST WINDS ON 
MONDAY WILL SLOWLY TURN THROUGH THE EAST ON TUESDAY...SOUTH BY LATE 
WEDNESDAY...AND THEN SOUTHWEST ON THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING 
COLD FRONT. WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL VERY LATE 
IN THE DAY THURSDAY OR EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. AT THIS TIME...NO 
CAUTIONARY OR ADVISORY HEADLINES ARE ANTICIPATED FOR ANY PERIOD.

NORTH ATLANTIC EARLY THIS MORNING...BETWEEN NORTH CAROLINA AND 
BERMUDA. A RIDGE EXTENDED SOUTHWEST ACROSS FLORIDA AND THE EASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO...JUST NORTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. MEANWHILE...A COLD 
FRONT WAS MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY 
AND TEXAS COASTAL PLAIN. WINDS WERE STILL QUITE LIGHT ACROSS THE 
SERVICE AREA...GENERALLY UNDER 10KT OUT OF THE NORTHEAST OR EAST. THE
AIR MASS IN PLACE OVER THE KEYS IS HIGHLY MODIFIED...WITH AIR 
TEMPERATURES HOLDING IN THE MID 70S...AND DEWPOINTS 65-70F. SKIES 
HAVE BEEN PARTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT THANKS TO CIRROSTRATUS ASSOCIATED

RADAR SCANS ACTUALLY SHOW A FEW SPRINKLES OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA
BEYOND 20 NAUTICAL MILES SOUTH OF THE ISLANDS. THESE SPRINKLES ARE 
ASSOCIATED WITH A NORTHWARD-MOVING CUBAN LAND BREEZE BOUNDARY. 

FORECAST REASONING FOR THIS CYCLE IS SIMILAR TO THE LAST FEW 
CYCLES...ESPECIALLY THROUGH TUESDAY. UPPER FLOW WILL TRANSITION FROM
WEAK RIDGING TO ZONAL FLOW AT THIS LATITUDE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. A

ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES WILL BEGIN TO GOVERN
LOW-LEVEL AIR TRAJECTORIES LOCALLY BY TONIGHT. AS SUCH...LIGHT MAINLY
EAST WINDS TODAY WILL BACK TO NORTH OR NORTHEAST TONIGHT THROUGH

CORRECTED DATE 

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLEAR WITH JUST A LITTLE CIRRUS FROM A SEGMENT OF 
THE SUBTROPICAL JET SPILLING IN FROM THE WEST. WINDS ARE LIGHT 
NORTHEAST NEAR 5 MPH OVER LAND AREAS...AND MAINLY EAST 5 TO 7 KNOTS 
ALONG THE REEF. TEMPERATURES WERE VERY SLOWLY FALLING INTO THE LOWER 
70S. 

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS IS OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA AND WILL SLIDE 
INTO THE WEST ATLANTIC AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AXIS SHIFTS EASTWARD 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS. 10/1800Z GFS INDICATES THE 
SUBTROPICAL JET SEGMENT WILL HEAD ACROSS CENTRAL/NORTHERN FLORIDA 
TAKING THE BULK OF ITS CIRRUS WITH IT. THE CURRENT MOSTLY CLEAR 
FORECAST FOR TONIGHT LOOKS FINE. THERE WERE INDICATIONS OF WEAK 
ISENTROPIC LIFT BELOW 850 MB OVER THE STRAITS...IN PART DUE TO THE 
NORTH CUBA COAST LANDBREEZE AND FROM A MERIDIONAL 850 MB RIDGE AXIS 
SLIDING A BIT FURTHER EAST. EXPECT MOST OF THE STRATOCUMULUS TO 
REMAIN OVER THE STRAITS UNTIL THE LOW LEVELS MOISTEN UP A BIT MORE.

&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT MOSTLY EAST WINDS AND RATHER SMOOTH SEAS WILL CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT. EAST WINDS WILL IMPROVE FOR SAILORS...10 TO 15 KNOTS OVER

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL OVERNIGHT ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. HOWEVER...DECREASING 
ONSHORE WINDS TO NEAR CALM IN CONJUNCTION WITH OVERNIGHT RADIATIVE 
COOLING WILL PRODUCE SOME AREAS OF PATCHY FOG OVER THE MAINLAND 
TOWARDS MORNING...MAINLY ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS OF METRO

.DISCUSSION...
A PERSISTENT...FRACTURED PANCAKE TYPE CLOUD LINE OVER THE LOWER KEYS 
HAS BEEN THE HIGHLIGHT FEATURE ACROSS ISLAND CHAIN THIS AFTERNOON. 
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE (1017 
MB) OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND THE ADJACENT GULF AND ATLANTIC 
WATERS. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS DEPICT 
NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE NOT 
DETECTING ANY PRECIPITATION ECHOES. 

.FORECAST...
A FAIRLY ZONAL DEEP TROPOSPHERIC FLOW WILL PREDOMINATE OVER THE GULF 
OF MEXICO AND FLORIDA PENINSULA THROUGH MONDAY...BEFORE A DEEPENING 
AND SLOWLY PROGRESSIVE TROUGH MOVES INTO THE EASTERN UNITED STATES 
AND GULF OF MEXICO WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. AT THE SURFACE...A WEAK 
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND THE ADJACENT 
GULF AND ATLANTIC WATERS WILL RETREAT EASTWARD AS A DISSIPATING COLD 
FRONT DROPS DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. 
MEANWHILE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE SWIFTLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
UNITED STATES AND BRIDGE THE DECAYING COLD FRONT...ALLOWING A 
REINFORCEMENT OF DRIER AIR TO FILTER INTO OUR REGION SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY. HENCE...POPS WILL BE LEFT OUT FOR THE ISLAND CHAIN UNTIL 
MONDAY NIGHT WHEN MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY GRADUALLY INCREASE. THE 
COMBINATION OF WEAK LARGE SCALE ASCENT AND THE APPROACHING LOW LEVEL 
CONFLUENCE BOUNDARY MAY PROMPT SCATTERED POPS WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY. HOWEVER...WITH PLENTY OF UNCERTAINTY REMAINING...WILL 
MAINTAIN ONLY ISOLATED POPS FOR NOW. TEMPERATURE WISE...STILL THERE 
IS POTENTIAL FOR RADIATIONAL COOLING TO ALLOW PORTIONS OF THE ISLAND 
CHAIN TO FALL INTO THE UPPER 60S TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...NEAR NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MONDAY...BUT WITH MODERATING 
TEMPERATURES THEREAFTER AS WINDS TURN SOUTHERLY WITH THE NEXT 
APPROACHING FRONT.  

&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT BREEZES WILL PREVAIL INTO THIS WEEKEND WITH ONLY A BRIEF SPELL 
OF GENTLE TO MODERATE WINDS SUNDAY...BEFORE SLACKENING AGAIN EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. MOSTLY SOUTHERLY WINDS SHOULD RETURN LATER NEXT 
WEEK...BUT NO CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS OR ADVISORIES WILL BE NECESSARY 
OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING ALONG THE KEY 
WEST TO MIAMI AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. SURFACE 
WINDS WILL BE LIGHT MAINLY FROM THE EAST NORTHEAST. WINDS ALOFT WILL 
BE GENERALLY LIGHT THROUGH FL200. ONLY FEW TO SCATTERED FAIR WEATHER 
CUMULUS ARE EXPECTED...WITH BASES NEAR FL035.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES HIGH PRESSURE (1018 MB) CENTERED 
OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...WITH A SNAKE LIKE STATIONARY FRONT 
LYING FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. WITH THE 
CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE...C-MAN STATION 
PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS DEPICT NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF LESS THAN 10 
KNOTS. MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE NOT DETECTING ANY PRECIPITATION 
ECHOES OVER OUR ENTIRE REGION. OTHERWISE...OUR MORNING SOUNDING 
REVEALS LIMITED MOISTURE (PWAT 1.02 INCHES) UNDERNEATH A WELL 
PRONOUNCED 5 DEGREE C INVERSION BASED AT 900 MB. A LIGHT AND CHAOTIC 
WIND PROFILE BECOMES A UNIDIRECTIONAL NORTHWEST FLOW ABOVE 700 MB. 

.REST OF TODAY...
OUTSIDE OF A FEW PATCHES OF STRATOCUMULUS TRAPPED BELOW THE 
AFOREMENTIONED (1ST PARAGRAPH) INVERSION...MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES SHOULD 
PREVAIL ACROSS THE ISLAND CHAIN. TEMPERATURE WISE...NEARSHORE WATER 
TEMPERATURES OF AROUND 80 DEGREES SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES A TAD 
BELOW NORMAL. SINCE THE CURRENT ZONE FORECAST FOR THE ISLAND CHAIN 
HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...NO UPDATES ARE ANTICIPATED.

&&

.MARINE...
OUR MORNING RAWINDSONDE DEPICTS NEARLY NO WIND AT 1 AND 2 THOUSAND 
FEET...WHILE THE LATEST KBYX VWP SHOWS NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF 5 
KNOTS AND SOUTHEAST WINDS OF 5 KNOTS RESPECTIVELY. FURTHERMORE...AN 
EARLY MORNING QUICKSCAT SHOWS EAST WINDS OF AROUND 5 KNOTS OVER THE 
WESTERN PORTION OF OUR REGION. WITH THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA SHIFTING INTO THE ATLANTIC...A LIGHT NORTHEAST 
TO EAST WIND OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS SHOULD PREVAIL FOR THE BALANCE OF 
TODAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS. SURFACE 
WINDS WILL BE LIGHT GENERALLY OUT OF THE EAST NORTHEAST...WITH LIGHT

.DISCUSSION...
A CALM AND MILD EARLY NOVEMBER MORNING IS UNDERWAY ACROSS THE FLORIDA
KEYS...WITH AIR TEMPERATURES HOLDING IN THE 65-70F RANGE AT MOST
LOCATIONS. AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS SHOWS RIDGING ALOFT OVER
MOST OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES...GULF OF MEXICO...AND
NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN SEA...WITH A LARGE REGION OF SUBSIDENCE AND DRY
AIR SUGGESTED BY GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGERY. AT THE SURFACE...A
1016MB HIGH PRESSURE CELL WAS CENTERED OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA
WITH VERY LIGHT DIFLUENT NORTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE KEYS. A MODIFIED
CONTINENTAL POLAR AIR MASS COVERS THE SERVICE AREA...AND MARITIME
TROPICAL AIR HAS BEEN PUSHED SOUTH OF CUBA. KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR
SCANS ARE CURRENTLY VOID OF PRECIPITATION ECHOES...AND ONLY A FEW
STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS ARE INDICATED AROUND THE ISLANDS BY GOES-12
INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES.

WEAK RIDGING OR ZONAL FLOW WILL PREVAIL IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH ASSOCIATED VERY WEAK SYNOPTIC-SCALE
VERTICAL MOTION FIELDS. BY TUESDAY...FALLING GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHTS
ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND EASTERN GULF BASIN WILL BE OCCURRING
IN RESPONSE TO AN APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH...BUT SYNOPTIC-SCALE ASCENT
WILL LIKELY STILL BE QUITE WEAK...AS THE STRONGEST VORTICITY REMAINS
NORTH OF THE SERVICE AREA. MODIFIED CONTINENTAL POLAR AIR
TRAJECTORIES SHOULD PERSIST IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...LIMITING AIR
MASS MODIFICATION AND KEEPING STATIC STABILITY HIGH. AS A
RESULT...RAIN CHANCES WILL BE NEAR ZERO TODAY THROUGH MONDAY. SOME
AIR MASS MODIFICATION AND WARM ADVECTION IS POSSIBLE TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY OWING TO THE APPROACH OF THE MIDLATITUDE TROUGH. HOWEVER...
RAIN CHANCES WILL REMAIN SLIGHT TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.

.MARINE...
LIGHT NORTH BREEZES WILL TURN NORTHEAST TO EAST LATER TODAY...WITH
BREEZES VARYING BETWEEN EAST AND NORTH TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. BY
TUESDAY...BREEZES WILL LIKELY FRESHEN SOME FROM THE SOUTHEAST. RAIN-
FREE CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AT LEAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH
ISOLATED SHOWERS PERHAPS DEVELOPING OVER THE GULF STREAM BY MONDAY.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. A FEW POCKETS OF MIST WILL RESULT IN 
LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS AROUND THE EVERGLADES THIS MORNING...ENDING 
SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE MAINLY 
NORTHEAST BUT VERY LIGHT THIS MORNING...LESS THAN 5 KT THROUGH AT 
LEAST SUNRISE...THEN BECOME EAST NORTHEAST AROUND 5-7 KT THIS 
AFTERNOON.

.CURRENTLY...
SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLEAR WITH JUST A LITTLE CIRRUS FROM A SEGMENT OF 
THE SUBTROPICAL JET SPILLING IN FROM THE WEST. WINDS ARE LIGHT 
NORTHEAST NEAR 5 MPH OVER LAND AREAS...AND MAINLY EAST 5 TO 7 KNOTS 
ALONG THE REEF. TEMPERATURES WERE VERY SLOWLY FALLING INTO THE LOWER 
70S. 

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS IS OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA AND WILL SLIDE 
INTO THE WEST ATLANTIC AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AXIS SHIFTS EASTWARD 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS. 10/1800Z GFS INDICATES THE 
SUBTROPICAL JET SEGMENT WILL HEAD ACROSS CENTRAL/NORTHERN FLORIDA 
TAKING THE BULK OF ITS CIRRUS WITH IT. THE CURRENT MOSTLY CLEAR 
FORECAST FOR TONIGHT LOOKS FINE. THERE WERE INDICATIONS OF WEAK 
ISENTROPIC LIFT BELOW 850 MB OVER THE STRAITS...IN PART DUE TO THE 
NORTH CUBA COAST LANDBREEZE AND FROM A MERIDIONAL 850 MB RIDGE AXIS 
SLIDING A BIT FURTHER EAST. EXPECT MOST OF THE STRATOCUMULUS TO 
REMAIN OVER THE STRAITS UNTIL THE LOW LEVELS MOISTEN UP A BIT MORE.

&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT MOSTLY EAST WINDS AND RATHER SMOOTH SEAS WILL CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT. EAST WINDS WILL IMPROVE FOR SAILORS...10 TO 15 KNOTS OVER 
THE STRAITS...BY LATER SUNDAY.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL OVERNIGHT ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
AVIATION ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. HOWEVER...DECREASING 
ONSHORE WINDS TO NEAR CALM IN CONJUNCTION WITH OVERNIGHT RADIATIVE 
COOLING WILL PRODUCE SOME AREAS OF PATCHY FOG OVER THE MAINLAND 
TOWARDS MORNING...MAINLY ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS OF METRO 
MIAMI-DADE.  THESE AREAS OF PATCHY FOG WILL DISPERSE FAIRLY RAPIDLY 
AFTER SUNRISE GIVING RISE TO SCT CU DURING THE DAY. WINDS ALOFT WILL 
BE GENERALLY LIGHT THROUGH FL200.

.CURRENTLY...
RELATIVELY WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE (1012 MB) WAS CENTERED 
DIRECTLY IN THE MIDDLE OF THE GULF OF MEXICO AT 2 AM (06Z). THE 
AIRMASS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HIGH PRESSURE RANGES FROM COOL OVER THE 
SE STATES...TO MILD OVER FLORIDA...AND IT IS VERY DRY JUST ABOVE THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE HIGH CENTER...AND
A LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OFF THE U.S. NE COAST...IS KEEPING NNW 
WINDS BLOW 15 KT OVER THE UPPER KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS...WHILE
NNW WINDS HAVE COME DOWN TO 10 KT OR JUST UNDER OVER WESTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE KEYS FROM KEY WEST TO DRY TORTUGAS. A STUBBORN DECK 
OF CLOUDS IN THE 6-8 THSD FT AGL LEVEL HAVE BEEN FORMING AND MOVING 
ACROSS THE KEYS. DOPPLER RADAR SHOWS WSW WINDS AT THE CLOUD LEVEL...
WHOSE BACK EDGE IS NOT FAR WEST AND NORTH OF THE KEYS. SOME PATCHY 
LOWER CLOUDS ARE STILL SEEN OVER SE GULF WATERS NORTHWEST OF THE 
LOWER KEYS AS WELL. WATER VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOW DRY 
AIR ABOVE THE CLOUDS...WITH EVEN DRIER AIR CONTINUING TO ADVECT THIS 
WAY FROM THE NW AND N. TEMPS REMAIN IN THE MID 70S AT KEYS SITES...
AND DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE MID 60S WITH LOWER DEWPOINTS POISED OVER 
THE MAINLAND NOT FAR AWAY. 

.FORECAST...
SIGNS STILL POINT TO A BENIGN AND FINE WEATHER PATTERN...SUPERB 
ACTUALLY...FOR THE KEYS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS INCLUDING THE 
WEEKEND. 

TODAY...MODELS CONCUR THAT WINDS AT 6-8 THSD FT AGL (WHERE A DECK OF 
BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUDS CURRENTLY ARE) WILL TURN FROM WSW TO 
W...WHILE DRY AIR MOVES IN AT THAT LEVEL...WHISKING THESE CLOUDS 
AWAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW DRYING AT MOST LEVELS THROUGH THE 
DAY...BRINGING PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES DOWN BELOW 1 INCH...MAKING 
A FORECAST OF MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WITH NO SHOWERS STILL ON TRACK. AS 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVES EAST TOWARD FLORIDA...LIGHTER NW TO N 
WINDS WILL BLOW. GUIDANCE TEMPS ARE ALL CONSISTENT...NEAR 80F FOR 
HIGHS TODAY. 

TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...THE WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AREA 
IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...WITH A WEAK RIDGE 
EXTENDING FROM THE ATLANTIC WEST OVER THE PENINSULA SATURDAY. 
MEANWHILE...MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE MOVING 
EAST OVER THE GULF TO FLORIDA. ALL THIS WILL KEEP DRY AIR AT THE 
SURFACE AND ALOFT IN PLACE OVER FLORIDA AND THE KEYS...WITH A LIGHT 
SURFACE WIND FLOW THAT GRADUALLY TURNS TO NE TO E FRI AND SAT. 
MINIMUM TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WILL BE KEPT A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW MOS 
GUIDANCE DUE TO EXPECTED LOWER DEWPOINTS, CLEAR SKIES, AND QUITE 
LIGHT WINDS. LOWS SOMEWHERE IN THE 60S MAY BE SEEN AT MOST KEYS 
ISLAND LOCATIONS. 

SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A LARGER  HIGH PRESSURE AREA IS EXPECTED 
TO MOVE OVER THE EASTERN STATES AND NW ATLANTIC...WHICH IN TURN IS 
EXPECTED TO CAUSE A LITTLE MORE WIND FLOW FROM THE EAST TO SOUTHEAST 
OVER THE KEYS AT LOW LEVELS. ENHANCED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY BRING A 
FEW SHOWERS IN...20 PCT POPS ARE CARRIED FROM MONDAY ONWARD WHICH IS 
CONSISTENT WITH THE LATEST EXTENDED GFS MOS OUTPUT. NIGHT TIME 
MINIMUM TEMPS SHOULD CLIMB BACK INTO THE MID 70S.

.DISCUSSION...
EARLY MORNING VISIBLE SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHS CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS 
OVER THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE ATLANTIC WATERS LIFTING OUT...BUT 
WITH A COUPLE OF FINE LINES OVER THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. THE 
FIRST BOUNDARY...ASSOCIATED WITH A TROUGH STRETCHES FROM CAPE SABLE 
TO JUST NORTH OF SMITH SHOAL LIGHT. THE SECOND RATHER DIFFUSE ROPE 
CLOUD...ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT...EXTENDS FROM NAPLES TO 
ABOUT 30 MILES NORTHWEST OF DRY TORTUGAS...WHILE BOTH FEATURES ARE 
DROPPING SOUTHEAST AT 15 TO 20 MPH. MEANWHILE...DEEPENING LOW 
PRESSURE (998 MB) IS LOCATED NEAR THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST...WITH 
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE (1012 MB) OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO. OTHERWISE...OUR MORNING SOUNDING REVEALS A CONDITIONALLY 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS UP TO 700 MB...WITH CONSIDERABLE AIR ABOVE. 

.REST OF TODAY...
WITH AN ELONGATED MID AND UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST 
UNITED STATES SHIFTING EASTWARD...A WEAK LOBE OF VORTICITY WILL PASS 
THROUGH OUR REGION THIS AFTERNOON. GIVEN ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
AND THE AFOREMENTIONED (1ST PARAGRAPH) BOUNDARIES PROVIDING WEAK 
CONVERGENCE...A BRIEF LIGHT SHOWER OR SPRINKLE IS POSSIBLE ACROSS A 
FEW ISLAND COMMUNITIES LATE THIS MORNING. WITH NO COLD AIR ADVECTION 
UNTIL TONIGHT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD CLIMB INTO THE LOWER AND MID 80S 
WITH TURNING WINDS. HENCE...ONCE THESE FEATURES PASS THROUGH OR 
DISSIPATE...WILL UPDATE THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST TO REMOVE 20 
PERCENT POPS. 

&&

.MARINE...
OUR MORNING RAWINDSONDE DEPICTS WEST WINDS OF 3 AND 16 KNOTS AT 1 
AND 2 THOUSAND FEET...WHILE THE LATEST KBYX VWP SHOWS WEST NORTHWEST 
WINDS OF 15 KNOTS AT THE SAME LEVELS RESPECTIVELY. WITH THE LATEST 
C-MAN STATION OBSERVATIONS INDICATING WEST NORTHWEST WINDS OF 10 TO 
15 KNOTS...WILL MAINTAIN WINDS BECOMING NORTHWEST NEAR 15 KNOTS ON 
ALL WATERS. OTHERWISE...ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH 
EARLY AFTERNOON.  

&&

.AVIATION...
PATCHES OF LOW MFVR CEILINGS OVER SOUTH FLORIDA WILL GRADUALLY 
DISSIPATE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS MORNING. THEREAFTER...VFR 
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT THE 
ISLAND TERMINALS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. ONLY A FEW HIGH 
MVFR SHOWERS ARE  EXPECTED...PARTICULARLY OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN 
PORTION OF THE ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS...STARTING OUT WESTERLY AT 
AROUND 10 KNOTS...WILL BECOME MORE NORTHWESTERLY AROUND 12 KNOTS AS 
A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE KEYS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
430 AM EST WED NOV 8 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SEVERAL WEAK SURFACE TROUGHS ARE MOVING SE OVER FLORIDA AND ADJACENT 
WATERS ABOUT AS EXPECTED. THE FIRST HAS PROGRESSED INTO THE OUTER 
FLORIDA STRAITS...HAVING TURNED WINDS FROM S TO SW AS IT PASSED THE 
KEYS LATE YESTERDAY AND LAST EVENING. FARTHER NORTH...WHAT APPEARS 
TO BE A WEAK COLD FRONT SLICING ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA...FOLLOWED BY 
NW WINDS AND A SLIGHT DROP IN TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS. SOUTH OF THIS 
FRONT...A BROAD BAGGY TROUGH SAGS SOUTH OVER THE SOUTHERN PENINSULA 
AND EXTREME SE GULF...CAUSING A GRADUAL BEND OF WINDS FROM SW TO W 
THEN WNW AS IT DRIFTS EAST. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS SEVERAL 
SWATHS OF ALTERNATING MOIST AND DRY AIR MOVING SE IN TANDEM WITH 
THESE WEAK TROUGHS. DEEPER MOISTURE AND UNSTABLE AIR STILL LINGERING 
IN THE OUTER FLORIDA STRAITS HAVE PRODUCED NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE LATE NIGHT HOURS... BUT THESE ARE 
ABOUT TO DEPART INTO BAHAMAS WATERS. A BAND OF SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR 
ALOFT JUST NW OF THE KEYS...IS FOLLOWED BY A BAND OF A BIT DEEPER 
MOISTURE ALONG THE WEAK FRONT...WITH MUCH DRIER AIR NW OF THAT 
SPILLING INTO THE NORTHERN GULF AND SOUTHERN STATES. SEVERAL SMALL 
LINES OF SHOWERS ARE SEEN ON KEY WEST, MIAMI, AND TAMPA DOPPLER 
RADARS OVER THE FLORIDA GULF COASTAL WATERS BETWEEN THE KEYS AND 
THE WEST CENTRAL FLORIDA COAST.

.FORECAST...
RESIDUAL MOISTURE TODAY MAY PRODUCE A FEW SHOWERS IN THE AREA AND 
SOME PERIODS OF CLOUD CEILINGS...BUT IT SHOULDNT BE ANYWHERE NEAR 
AS TURBULENT AS YESTERDAY. 

WITH WEAK TROUGHS FINALLY PASSING THE AREA BY END OF TODAY...A SUPER 
NICE WEATHER PERIOD STILL IS IN STORE FOR THE KEYS TONIGHT ON 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH MORE DAILY SUNSHINE...LIGHTER WINDS... 
LOWER HUMIDITIES...PLEASANT TEMPERATURES, EVEN MILD AT NIGHT...
AND CALMER SEAS FOR THE BOATERS. 

TODAY...DESPITE A BIT OF DRYING ALOFT MAINLY ABOVE 10 THSD FT DURING 
THE DAY...MODELS INDICATE LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE WILL STILL BE IN THE 
AREA...WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS STILL POSSIBLE INTO THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS. A SMALL BAND OF SLIGHTLY ENHANCED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS SEEN 
TO FINALLY PASS SE OVER THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. SURFACE WINDS...NOW 
SW TO W...SHOULD GO DUE WEST EARLY THIS MORNING...GRADUALLY TURN WNW 
AND PICK UP A BIT IN SPEED AS A LOWER PRESSURE PASSES WELL TO OUR 
NORTH...THEN TURN NW BEFORE END OF DAY AS THAT LAST WEAK TROUGH 
PASSES. 20 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE CARRIED...PER ALL MOS 
GUIDANCE. MODELS INDICATE RATHER LOW SURFACE-BASED LIFTED INDEX 
VALUES THROUGH MID AFTERNOON...AND A SMALL LINE OF SHOWERS OVER THE 
SE GULF HAS TOPS UP TO 25 THSD FT AT THIS TIME. THERE IS A SMALL 
OUTSIDE CHANCE OF AN ISOLATED CB...BUT I WILL NOT RE-INSERT MENTION 
OF THIS TO FORECASTS AT THIS TIME AS THE UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH.

TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...VERY DRY AIR ALOFT...INCLUDING ALL 
THE WAY UP THROUGH THE CIRRUS LEVEL...IS FORECAST TO SETTLE SOUTH 
OVER THE KEYS. SURFACE DEWPOINTS ALSO SHOULD DROP AT LEAST INTO THE 
60S...AND DAYTIME MIXING MAY ALLOW SOME EVEN LOWER DEWPOINTS. 
ALOFT...AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO FORM OVER THE GULF AND 
SHIFT EAST TOWARD FLORIDA...PROVIDING LARGELY IMPULSE-FREE NW FLOW
EVEN AT HIGH LEVELS (200-300 MB). NO MENTION OF SHOWERS IS IN ORDER. 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TOO SHOULD SPREAD EASY-LIKE OVER THE GULF TO 
FLORIDA...GIVING LIGHT WINDS 5-10 MPH THURSDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. 
SIGNS POINT TO A MOST PLEASANT PERIOD. 

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...SURFACE FLOW IS EXPECTED TO 
GRADUALLY TURN TO NE THEN E...AND PICK UP MAYBE TO 10 MPH OR SO ON 
THE KEYS SUNDAY...WITH A MODEST RETURN OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. I HAVE 
LEFT MENTION OF SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN THE CURRENT FORECAST 
PACKAGE...BUT IN FACT SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT STILL SHOW DRY AIR 
AT AND ABOVE 5 THSD FT AGL THAT MAY SQUELCH SHOWERS. CIRRUS MAY 
BEGIN TO SHOW UP WITH WESTERLY WINDS AGAIN AT HIGH LEVELS. 

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...EXTENDED GFS SHOWS DEEPER MOISTURE OVER THE 
KEYS...A TURN OF WINDS TO SE AND S THROUGH THE LOWER 10 THSD FT OF 
THE ATMOSPHERE...AND A RETURN OF STRONGER HIGH LEVEL FLOW. 20 PCT 
POPS ARE RETAINED TIL WE SEE BETTER DETAILS OF THIS PERIOD. 
&&

.MARINE...
CANT RULE OUT ISOLATED SHOWERS TODAY AS A FINAL TROUGH APPROACHES 
AND PASSES THE KEYS. WINDS EARLY TODAY OUGHT TO GO W THEN WNW...AND
BY END OF DAY THE WEAK TROUGH WILL TURN WINDS TO NW...AND SPEEDS ARE 
EXPECTED TO PICK UP CLOSE TO 15 KT DURING THE DAY AS SOME LOWER 
PRESSURE PASSES WELL TO OUR NORTH. THEREAFTER THROUGH THE WEEK AND 
INTO THE WEEKEND...BENIGN AND FINE WINDS AND WEATHER ARE EXPECTED TO 
SET IN FOR THE KEYS AND WATERS...AS WEAK HIGH PRESSURE SPREADS EAST 
OVER THE GULF TO THE KEYS. DRY AIR SHOULD ELIMINATE SHOWER 
WORRIES...NW TO N WINDS UP TO 10 KT THU SHOULD GO LESS THAN 10 KT ON 
KEYS WATERS THU NIGHT...TURNING GRADUALLY TO NE TO E BY SATURDAY. 

THERE IS SOME INDICATIONS THAT DURING SUNDAY...STRONGER HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE EASTERN U.S. AND THIS MAY PUMP UP 
SUNDAY WINDS TO ENE 10-15 KT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF 
LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE THIS MORNING. IN 
ADDITION...STRATUS CLOUDS WILL PRODUCE SOME IFR CEILINGS AROUND 
700-900 FT AGL ALONG THE ROUTE. AT THIS TIME IT IS UNCERTAIN AS TO 
THE COVERAGE OF SUCH CEILINGS OR WHEN THEY WILL END/RISE ABOVE THE 
IFR THRESHOLD. HAVE INCLUDED ONLY LOCAL IFR CIGS IN THE TWEB AT THIS 
TIME...BUT IF THE STRATUS DECK BECOMES MORE WIDESPREAD WILL NEED TO 
UPDATE TO INCREASE COVERAGE. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE 
WEST SOUTHWEST AT LESS THAN 10 KT THIS MORNING...BECOMING NORTHWEST 
AROUND 12 KT BY AROUND MIDDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE WATERS 
SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION 
ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND 
CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST NEAR 
10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST AT 10 TO 
15 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 80 DEGREES. ONLY ABOUT TWO DEGREES 
OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO GENTLE SURFACE WINDS OVER 
WATER WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR 80 DEGREES. 

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE IS POISED TO MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS EARLY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. DESPITE THE PRESENCE OF THIS TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE...LITTLE TO NO SURFACE CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF THE TROUGH OF 
LOW PRESSURE COUPLED WITH LITTLE TO NO LARGE SCALE LIFT AHEAD OF THE 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE SHOULD RESULT IN NO MORE THAN MIDDLE OF THE 
ROAD CHANCE POPS FOR TONIGHT. THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA 
KEYS HAS ALREADY BEEN UPDATED TO LOWER RAIN CHANCES FOR TONIGHT. 

&&

.MARINE...
A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS EARLY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. AS A RESULT...MODERATE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST SURFACE WINDS 
WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS. 
WINDS AND SEAS WILL ABATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
ISOLATED SHOWERS WITH MVFR VISIBILITIES AND CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED 
OVERNIGHT ALONG THE KMIA TO KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...WITH CELL MOTION 
FROM 270/25KT. ISOLATED TO WIDELY SEPARATED CELLS WITH IFR 
VISIBILITIES...CEILINGS AND POSSIBLE THUNDER EXPECTED OVER THE 
STRAITS BEYOND 25NM SOUTH OF KMTH AND KEY LARGO. OTHERWISE SCATTERED 
CLOUD DECKS BETWEEN 15 HUNDRED AND 25 HUNDRED FEET EXPECTED. THERE 
MAY BE OCCASIONAL BROKEN CEILINGS 8 TO 10 THOUSAND FEET OVERNIGHT. 
SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS EXPECTED FROM 220 
DEGREES THIS EVENING...AND OUT OF 250-270 DEGREES BY 1200Z 
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL GRADUALLY REDUCE THE CROSSWIND COMPONENT AT THE 
TERMINALS. WINDS WILL INCREASE OUT OF THE NORTHWEST...290 TO 310 
DEGREES...AFTER 1400Z WEDNESDAY WITH VFR WEATHER EXPECTED.

TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE KEYS REACHED THE LOW TO MID 80S EARLIER THIS 
AFTERNOON...WHILE DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN LINGERING IN THE LOWER 70S. 
SKIES HAVE BEEN PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON...WITH MOST 
OF THE KEYS REMAINING FREE OF PRECIPITATION. HOWEVER...KBYX RADAR 
DETECTED A LARGE SWATH OF RAIN WITH A FEW EMBEDDED HEAVIER SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE KEYS WATERS NORTH AND WEST OF KEY WEST 
FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. CMAN PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN REPORTING MAINLY SOUTH 
WINDS AROUND 15 KNOTS...WITH LAND LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN AVERAGING 
SOUTH WINDS OF 10 TO 15 MPH. 

.FORECAST...
A SURFACE FEATURE REMAINS SITUATED JUST NORTH AND WEST OF THE KEYS 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE MAIN LONGWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT STILL OVER THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. WITH THE PROXIMITY OF THE 
SURFACE FEATURE...AS WELL AS SOUTHWEST STEERING FLOW AND AMPLE 
MOISTURE...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN LIKELY THIS 
EVENING...WHILE SCATTERED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL PERSIST 
OVERNIGHT. THE LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL DIG THROUGH CENTRAL FLORIDA 
OVERNIGHT...AND PUSH THROUGH SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS WEDNESDAY. 
ONCE THE TROUGH PASSES THROUGH THE KEYS...TEMPERATURES WILL COOL OFF 
A FEW DEGREES FROM THE PAST FEW DAYS...WITH A MUCH DRIER AIRMASS 
ENTERING OVER THE AREA. NEAR NIL RAIN CHANCES WILL PERSIST WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AS WEAK HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OVER 
THE GULF OF MEXICO OVER FLORIDA. 

THE WEAK HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC 
EAST OF FLORIDA SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. MEANWHILE...ANOTHER 
FRONT WILL APPROACH FLORIDA SATURDAY NIGHT...AND STALL OUT OVER 
CENTRAL/SOUTH FLORIDA ON SUNDAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD IN 
FROM JUST OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST SUNDAY AND PREVAIL OVER THE AREA 
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. NEAR NORMAL CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN IN THE 
FORECAST FOR SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

SOUTH WINDS THIS EVENING WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT TO THE SOUTHWEST 
OVERNIGHT...AND EVENTUALLY TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST AROUND 15 KNOTS 
WEDNESDAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE TROUGH. WINDS WILL GRADUALLY ABATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. LIGHTER NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS WILL 
SETTLE IN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE WINDS 
FROM THE NORTHEAST TO EAST OVER THE WEEKEND. 
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI INCLUDING THE KEY WEST

.DISCUSSION...
A SURFACE BOUNDARY LIES TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE KEYS THIS 
MORNING...FROM AROUND MARCO ISLAND EXTENDING SOUTHWEST TO AROUND THE 
DRY TORTUGAS. A LARGE SWATH OF RAIN WITH EMBEDDED HEAVIER SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS...INCLUDING A BOW ECHO AND MESOCYCLONE...ARE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SURFACE BOUNDARY. MEANWHILE OVER THE KEYS 
ISLAND CHAIN...TEMPERATURES ARE CURRENTLY IN THE LOWER 80S...WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. CMAN STATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTING 
SOUTHEAST WINDS AROUND 20 KNOTS AND GUSTY AT SAND KEY AND PULASKI 
SHOAL...WHILE THE OTHER PLATFORMS ARE AVERAGING SOUTHEAST WINDS 
AROUND 15 KNOTS. A MARINE REPORT FROM JUST INSIDE THE REEF NORTH OF 
SAND KEY REPORTED 2 FOOT SEAS...WITH A 3 FOOT SWELL AND 18 KNOT 
WINDS. 

.THIS AFTERNOON...
DUE TO THE APPROACH OF THE TROUGH OVER NORTH/CENTRAL FLORIDA...AS 
WELL AS AMPLE MOISTURE AND THE SWATH OF CONVECTION NORTHWEST OF THE 
KEYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE BOUNDARY...LIKELY RAIN CHANCES 
REMAIN REASONABLE AND WILL BE MAINTAINED AT THIS TIME. THE FORECAST 
WILL BE UPDATED ONLY TO REMOVE TRANSITIONAL WORDING.
&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR SEAS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS THIS AFTERNOON. SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS 
AND GUSTY WILL PREVAIL...AND GRADUALLY ABATE TO NEAR 15 KNOTS LATE 
THIS AFTERNOON. SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WINDS AROUND 15 KNOTS WILL 
PERSIST OVER THE BAY AND GULF WATERS. THE OTHER HAZARD FOR MARINERS 
THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE INCREASING THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY...PRODUCING 
GUSTY WINDS OVER 30 KNOTS...DANGEROUS LIGHTNING...AND LOCALLY 
ROUGHER SEAS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI INCLUDING THE KEY WEST 
AND MARATHON TERMINALS...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE IN 
COVERAGE WITH THE STRONGER ACTIVITY GENERATING WIND GUSTS OF 30

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
500 AM EST TUE NOV 7 2006

.DISCUSSION...
THE LARGE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT HAS PRODUCED STRONG 
NE-E WINDS OVER THE KEYS FOR SEVERAL DAYS...HAS BEGUN AN EASTWARD 
SHIFT AS EXPECTED...AND KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE RESPONDED IN PART BY 
THIS...HAVING TURNED TO ESE AT ISLAND AND MARINE SITES...WITH LATEST 
WIND SPEEDS DOWN CONSIDERABLY TO NEAR 15 KT AT BAY WIND GAUGES...
15-20 KT ON THE REEF EXCEPT STILL RUNNING CLOSE TO 20 KT OVER 
WESTERN WATERS AT DRY TORTUGAS. LOOKING TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST...
A COMPLEX SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN COVERS THE GULF...NOT TOO UNLIKE 
MODELS HAD BEEN INDICATING. A WARM-FRONT-LIKE BOUNDARY EXTENDS SSE 
OVER THE EAST CENTRAL GULF...WITH AREAS OF CONVECTION ONGOING ALONG 
AND EAST OF THIS BOUNDARY. BUOY 42003 IN THE EAST CENTRAL GULF...JUST
EAST OF THIS BOUNDARY...HAS BEEN REPORTING SE TO S WINDS 20-30 KT 
WITH GUSTS OVER 35 KT FOR SEVERAL HOURS. EITHER AN EXTENSION OF THIS 
BOUNDARY INTO THE CARIBBEAN...OR REFLECTION OF UPPER LEVEL LIFT...
IS PRODUCING A BAND OF CONVECTION FROM JUST WEST OF CUBA IN THE 
GULF...EXTENDING INTO THE CARIBBEAN SOUTH OF CUBA. LOW PRESSURE IS 
TAKING SHAPE IN THE VICINITY OF NORTH ALABAMA. CONTRIBUTING TO THE 
COMPLEX PATTERN OVER THE GULF...THERE IS ANOTHER SURFACE TROUGH 
EXTENDING SOUTH FROM ALABAMA INTO THE GULF...WHILE THE ACTUAL COLD 
FRONT IS WELL BACK OVER THE NW GULF HAVING MOVED OFF THE TEXAS COAST 
EARLIER LAST NIGHT. 

.FORECAST...
MOST MODELS HAVE SPEEDED THE EAST PROGRESSION OF WEATHER PATTERNS 
FROM THE GULF...WITH JUST THE EUROPEAN LAGGING A BIT WITH FINAL 
PASSAGE OF A SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE KEYS WEDNESDAY. EACH MODEL HAS 
SOME QUESTIONABLE RESULTS...BUT THE GFS, THE NAM, AND THE OLD NGM
ALL HAVE PRODUCED HIGH PROBABILITIES OF PRECIP TODAY FOR THE KEYS...
SOME VARYING PRECIP NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT...THEN A QUICKER END TO 
SHOWERS WEDNESDAY. THIS MORNINGS ZONES FOLLOWED THIS FASTER TREND...
ALTHOUGH THE EVENTUAL PLAY-OUT OF CONVECTION-PRODUCING PATTERNS 
TODAY AND THIS EVENING IS FRAUGHT WITH UNCERTAINTY FOR THE KEYS 
AREA. 

NICER WEATHER...RETURN OF SUN...LESS WIND...LOWER HUMIDITY...SMALL 
IF ANY THREAT OF RAIN...STILL SEEMS IN STORE FOR THURSDAY AND MAYBE 
INTO THE WEEKEND AS WELL.

TODAY AND TONIGHT...THERE WAS CONCERN THAT THE FOCUS FOR THE MAIN 
SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY MIGHT JUST SCRAPE NORTH OF THE 
KEYS...HOWEVER WITH ALL OPERATIONAL MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS 
GENERATING POPS OVER 70 PCT FOR TODAY...I HAS TO INDICATE AT LEAST 
LIKELY CATEGORY POPS...AND INDICATED 60 PCT. MODELS GENERALLY SHOW
A SIGNIFICANT BACKING OF WINDS FROM 850-500 MB TODAY...GIVING A DEEP 
NEARLY SOUTH WIND OVER THE KEYS 18Z TIL AFTER 00Z TODAY. WHILE THIS 
MIGHT SUPPORT ADVECTION OF DEEPER MOISTURE INTO THE AREA FROM THE 
SOUTH...MODELS AS WELL INDICATE AN AREA OF LARGE SCALE LIFT 
ASSOCIATED WITH MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND SOME JET DYNAMICS AS 
WELL. ISENTROPIC LIFT IS IDENTIFIABLE AT THE 310K LEVEL. THE GFS 
SHOWS SOME CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK FIELDS OVER THE EAST GULF LATE 
TODAY...AND THE NAM KEEPS GENERATING A SURFACE LOW MOVING UP FROM 
THE YUCATAN OR CUBA WHICH MAY NOT BE REAL. SIMPLER SOLUTIONS BY THE 
OLD NGM AND UKMET MODELS AFFIRM A PRECIP FIELD ENCOMPASSING THE KEYS 
AT LEAST BY LATE AFTERNOON...CONTINUING INTO THE FIRST PART OF 
TONIGHT. THUS...60 PCT POPS WERE TIMIDLY ISSUED FOR BOTH 
PERIODS...TODAY (AFTERNOON OR EVEN LATE AFTERNOON...AND TONIGHT. 

WEDNESDAY...ONE OR MORE BOUNDARIES (TROUGHS) MAY ACTUALLY CROSS THE 
KEYS...BUT A SHIFT TO W-NW WINDS SHOULD END THE MAIN PRECIP 
THREAT...AND LATEST MODELS ARE QUICK WITH MOVING THIS EAST OF THE 
KEYS. I HELD ONTO 30 PCT POPS EARLY...BUT THIS MAY NEED PARING BACK.
GFS DOES, HOWEVER, INDICATE A TRAILING BACK OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...
SO CONTINUED LOW THREAT OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON IS 
REASONABLE. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...NW WINDS OFF THE GULF ARE INDICATED. A 10 PCT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS IS RETAINED. NOT MUCH COOLING IS SEEN. 

THURSDAY-THURSDAY NIGHT...DRY AIR IS FORECAST TO WORK DOWN TO LEVELS 
BELOW 850 MB...SO THREAT OF PRECIP SEEMS VERY LOW...AND I HAVE 
REMOVED MENTION OF SHOWERS. NW TO N WINDS SHOULD DECREASE IN 
SPEED...AND MAYBE CLOUD COVER WILL BE SKIMPIER. COOLER TEMPS ARE 
POSSIBLE THU NIGHT IF SKIES ARE CLEARER. 

FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...HIGH PRESSURE IS GRADUALLY FORECAST TO MOVE 
OVER FLORIDA (WEAK HIGH PRESSURE)...THEN INFLATE A BIT OVER THE 
ATLANTIC. A SLOW RETURN OF EAST SURFACE WINDS...A BIT MORE LOW LEVEL 
HUMIDITY...IS SEEN THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

.MARINE...
HIGH PRESSURE IS DEPARTING FARTHER TO THE EAST OVER THE ATLANTIC...
BUT TROUGHS OF LOW PRESSURE ARE APPROACHING ACROSS THE GULF OF 
MEXICO. WINDS GOING TO SE THIS MORNING SHOULD BE IN THE 15-20 KT 
RANGE OVER THE STRAITS...AND SEAS ALREADY BUILT UP FROM PAST DAYS OF 
WINDY CONDITIONS WILL TAKE A WHILE TO SUBSIDE...SO SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS IS IN EFFECT TODAY FOR ATLANTIC WATERS. 
A TURN OF WINDS TO SOUTH NEAR 15 KT IS EXPECTED BY LATE AFTERNOON...
GOING SW TONIGHT...THEN A TROUGH WILL PASS AND SHIFT WINDS TO 
W-NW 15 KT WEDNESDAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH
UPPER LEVEL PATTERNS AS WELL AS THE TROUGH ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE 
OVER THE KEYS AND WATERS THIS AFTERNOON BUT TIMING IS HARD TO NAIL 
DOWN...CONTINUING INTO TONIGHT. AREAS AROUND DRY TORTUGAS WILL SEE
SHOWERS AND STORMS FIRST TODAY. 

A NICER WIND PATTERN WITH LIGHTER SPEEDS FROM THE NORTH IS EXPECTED 
THU INTO THU NIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS THIS MORNING. AS A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST TODAY...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
INCREASE IN COVERAGE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING RESULTING IN AT 
LEAST WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR CONDITIONS...WITH MORE WIDESPREAD 
RAIN/SHOWERS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE DAY ALONG THE MAINLAND 
PORTION OF THE ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS WILL BE EAST SOUTHEAST AROUND 
12-16 KT AT KEYW AND 7-9 KT AT KMTH THIS MORNING...BECOMING SOUTH

THE PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE KEYS HAS BEEN RELAXING JUST A BIT 
THIS EVENING...AS EXPECTED.  WHILE WINDS ARE STILL BLOWING OVER 20 
KNOTS AT THE REEF...REPORTS ON THE GULF SIDE INDICATE THEY HAVE BEEN 
CLOSER TO 15 KNOTS THIS EVENING.  WE HAD ONE SHIP REPORT NEAR THE 
DRY TORTUGAS THAT INDICATED 6-8 FT SEAS.  THE 00Z SOUNDING IS FAIRLY 
STABLE...ALTHOUGH MOIST.  WHILE THE AIRMASS IS STABLE...MODELS 
INDICATE WEAK ISENTROPIC LEFT SHOULD OCCUR TONIGHT...AND GIVEN THE 
AMOUNT OF MOISTURE PRESENT...WOULD EXPECT A FEW SHOWERS TO DEVELOP 
IN THE STRAITS OVERNIGHT.  HOWEVER...MODELS ALSO INDICATE THAT MUCH 
OF THE ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE GOING INTO WARMING THE MID 
LEVELS...SO ANY PRECIP THAT DOES DEVELOP WILL BE VERY LIGHT.  

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT OVERNIGHT FOR THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS...WHERE EVEN IF WINDS DO DROP BELOW CRITERIA LATER 
TONGIHT...IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR SEAS TO SUBSIDE.  ON THE GULF 
SIDE...WINDS ARE ALREADY BELOW CRITERIA...AND GIVEN THE SHORT FETCH 
LENGTH...SEAS ARE PROBABLY ALSO BELOW SCA CRITERIA.  WILL ALLOW THE 
SCA TO EXPIRE FOR THE GULF ZONES...BUT SMALL CRAFT WILL NEED TO 
EXCERCISE CAUTION IN THE BAY AND GULF.  WINDS WILL DECREASE ACROSS 
ALL ZONES TOMORROW MORNING...FALLING TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS BY LATER 
AFTERNOON.

10 PERCENT FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...DUE TO THE 
DRIER AIRMASS. ALTHOUGH RAIN CHANCES MAY BE CLOSE TO NIL FOR MOST OF 
THIS PERIOD. TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE NEAR NORMAL TO A COUPLE 
OF DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.

BY SATURDAY...HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE NORTHWESTERN ATLANTIC WILL 
EXTEND OVER FLORIDA AND THE KEYS AND PERSIST THROUGH MONDAY. NEAR 
NORMAL CONDITIONS WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH THE PERIOD.

ENE WINDS IN THE 20-25 KT SUSTAINED RANGE (10 METER HEIGHT WINDS) 
WITH PEAK GUSTS TO 30 KT. LONG KEY ON THE BAY SIDE IS CLOSER TO 20 
KT AT THIS TIME. SURFACE TEMPS REMAIN STEADY IN THE MID 70S...WITH
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S. DESPITE THE SEEMINGLY DRY AIR...CLOUD 
LINES ORIENTED WITH THE LOWER LEVEL FLOW HAVE PRODUCED SMALL 
FAST-MOVING SHOWERS OVER THE STRAITS WHICH HAVE IMPACTED ISLANDS 
WITH BRIEF RAINFALL OVERNIGHT. KEY WEST PICKED UP .08 INCH IN TWO 
QUICK SHOWERS. MORE OF THE SAME IS SEEN UPSTREAM TOWARD THE BAHAMAS.
LOOKING WEST...THERE APPEARS TO BE A WARM FRONT DEVELOPING OVER THE 
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY AND TONIGHT...ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE IS STILL EXPECTED TO VERY 
GRADUALLY PULL AWAY TO THE EAST...ALLOWING THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TO 
RELAX OVER THE KEYS WITH LESSENING WIND SPEEDS PRIMARILY TUESDAY. 
THE NAM MODEL IS VERIFYING BETTER FOR THE CURRENT TIME...SO I WILL
FOLLOW ITS SLOWER RELAXING OF WIND SPEEDS TODAY AND TONIGHT. THIS IS 
IN CONCERT WITH THE ALREADY-FORECASTED WIND TRENDS FOR THE KEYS. 
OPPORTUNELY AIMED FAST-MOVING LOW-TOPPED SHOWERS MAY GIVE ISLAND A 
BIT HIGHER THREAT OF RAIN THAN 20 PCT POPS WOULD SUGGEST...BUT I 
WILL NOT RAISED POPS ABOVE THE CURRENT 20 PCT FOR EACH PERIOD 
DESPITE GFS 40 PCT FOR TODAY. A GRADUAL DECREASE IN WINDS IS 
EXPECTED TONIGHT.

TUESDAY...GFS MODEL SUGGESTS SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT AT THE 310K LEVEL 
(AROUND 700 MB)...BUT NEITHER IT NOR THE NAM MODEL SHOW ANY UVV 
FIELDS...BUT IN FACT SOME WEAK DOWNWARD MOTION AT THE LOWER LEVELS. 
I WAS TEMPTED TO RAISE POPS TO 30 PCT BASED ON A TURN OF WINDS ALOFT 
TO SE TO S IN THE 5-10 THSD FT AGL LEVELS...BUT WILL HOLD OFF AND 
MAINTAIN 20 PCT POPS TO SEE SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUN INTERPRETATIONS. 
SURFACE WINDS ON THE GFS WILL BE FOLLOWED...SHOWING A TURN OF WINDS 
TO ESE AND A DROP IN SPEED ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERNOON. AT THIS 
TIME...THE NAM MODEL CONTINUES TO SPIN UP A POSSIBLY BOGUS LOW 
PRESSURE CENTER OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...MOVE IT NE TOWARD 
FLORIDA...AND THUS BEGIN TO CONTAMINATE ITS WIND SPEEDS OVER THE 
KEYS. 

TUESDAY NIGHT-WEDNESDAY...ALL MODELS BRING A WEAK FRONT TO THE KEYS 
AROUND THE END OF DAY WEDNESDAY...PRECEDED TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN DEEP MOISTURE...A REGION OF SYNOPTIC 
SCALE LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH JET DYNAMICS AND A MID LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE TROUGH...AND AN INCREASE IN INSTABILITY. MODELS GENERALLY HAVE 
SURFACE BASED LIFTED INDEX VALUES FALLING INTO THE -3 TO -4 RANGE 
TUE NIGHT INTO WED. AT THIS TIME...I ONLY INCREASED POPS TO 40 PCT 
BUT DID ADD MENTION OF THUNDER. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A DRYING ALOFT IS SHOWN TO SWEEP IN OVER THE KEYS 
TOWARD THE END OF THE NIGHT. I WILL MAINTAIN CURRENTLY FORECASTED 30 
PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN CASE TIMING OF THE FRONT/TROUGH PASSAGE 
WITH SUBSEQUENT SHIFT OF WINDS TO NW IS LATER THAN CURRENT MODELS 
ARE SHOWING. 

THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...NO A LOT OF COOLING IS INDICATED BY 
EXTENDED GFS MODEL MOS...BUT SIGNIFICANT DRYING ALOFT IS SHOWN 
THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH MOISTURE RELEGATED TO LEVELS GENERALLY 
BELOW 5 THSD FT AGL. ANY PERIOD OF LIGHT WINDS AND LESSER CLOUDS 
DURING THIS TIME MAY ALLOW FOR A BIT COOLER NIGHTS. 

.MARINE...
STRONG HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NW ATLANTIC SHOULD KEEP THE MARINE 
AREA WINDS BLOWING AT LEAST 20 KT TODAY...A BIT MORE THIS MORNING.
A DROP IN WIND SPEEDS IS EXPECTED TO BE GRADUAL...TONIGHT AND EARLY 
TUESDAY...WITH A BETTER DROP IN WINDS COME TUESDAY AFTERNOON. 
EXPECT THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FLAGS TO FLY FOR ALL KEYS WATERS 
TODAY AND THIS EVENING...AND FOR THE STRAITS PROBABLY FOR AT LEAST 
THE FIRST HALF OF TUESDAY AT LEAST FOR SEAS OUT BEYOND THE REEF. 
AT QUICK TURN OF WINDS TO SE TUE NIGHT 10-15 KT...WILL BE FOLLOWED 
BY SW WINDS WED...ALONG WITH THE THREAT OF SHOWERS AND MAYBE A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS. A TROUGH OR WEAK FRONT WILL SHIFT WINDS TO W AND NW 
SOMETIME LATE WED OR WED NIGHT...WITH SPEEDS MAYBE 10-15 KT.

ATLANTIC MONDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES SHOULD REMAIN JUST 
ABOVE ONE AND ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH TODAY THROUGH MONDAY. NO MORE 
THAN DIME POPS ARE NEEDED FOR TODAY THROUGH MONDAY DUE TO A 
RELATIVELY DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE COUPLED WITH ANTICYCLONIC FLOW IN 
ALL LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. LOW PRESSURE MAY DEVELOP OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES MONDAY NIGHT. IF THIS HAPPENS...5 KFT TO 
10 KFT WINDS WOULD SHIFT TO SOUTHERLY MONDAY NIGHT. IN TURN...THIS 
WIND SHIFT WOULD HELP TO DRAW MOISTURE NORTHWARD FROM THE CARIBBEAN 
MONDAY NIGHT. PWAT VALUES SHOULD INCREASE TO JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE 
HALF OF AN INCH MONDAY NIGHT. DUE TO THIS INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC

A SPRAWLING 1037MB CONTINENTAL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS ANALYZED NEAR
THE VIRGINIA/NORTH CAROLINA BORDER THIS MORNING WITH A STRONG
PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...EASTERN GULF
BASIN...AND STRAITS OF FLORIDA. AT GRAND CAYMAN...MSL PRESSURE WAS
ONLY 1015MB. A COMBINATION OF CIRRUS STREAMING NORTHEASTWARD AND
STRATOCUMULUS MOVING SOUTHWESTWARD WAS PRODUCING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES
ACROSS THE KEYS AND HOLDING AIR TEMPERATURES BELOW 80F. LITTLE OR NO
COLD AIR ADVECTION IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE HAS ALLOWED DEWPOINTS TO
CLIMB BACK TO NEAR 70F AS 30-35KT BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW OVER SEA
SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 80S IS FACILITATING STRONG UPWARD
FLUXES OF HEAT AND MOISTURE FROM THE SEA SURFACE.

FORECASTS HAVE BEEN UPDATED TO INCREASE CLOUD COVER AND REDUCE BY A
TAD THE HIGH TEMPERATURES. SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL MOVE RAPIDLY TOWARD
THE EAST-SOUTHEAST THROUGH THIS EVENING.

.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED...LIGHT SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST AREA. 
SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE 
NORTHEAST AT 15 TO 20 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHEAST 
NEAR 20 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 25 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 
MID 70S. ONLY ABOUT SIX DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO 
STRONG NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR 80 
DEGREES.  

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS AS STRONG NORTHEAST TO EAST SURFACE WINDS ARE 
EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. A LARGE AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC REGION TODAY. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES SHOULD BE JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE 
HALF OF AN INCH TODAY. DESPITE ADEQUATE ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE FOR 
PRECIPITATION TODAY...INCREASING NORTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD 
RESULT IN NO SURFACE TRIGGER FOR SHOWER DEVELOPMENT. WITH THAT IN 
MIND...LOW CHANCE POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR TODAY...WHICH IS BELOW 
THE MAJORITY OF NUMERICAL MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS. STRONG NORTHEAST 
SURFACE WINDS TONIGHT SHOULD PUSH A DRIER AIR MASS OVER THE KEYS. BY 
SUNRISE SUNDAY...PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE JUST BELOW ONE AND ONE 
QUARTER OF AN INCH. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR TONIGHT. 
THE SERVICE AREA WILL REMAIN ALONG THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF A LARGE 
ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES SUNDAY 
AND SUNDAY NIGHT. THE LARGE ANTICYCLONE SHOULD MOVE INTO THE 
NORTHWEST ATLANTIC MONDAY. PWAT VALUES SHOULD REMAIN JUST BELOW ONE 
AND ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY. NO MORE THAN DIME 
POPS ARE NEEDED FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY DUE TO A DRY AIR MASS IN 
PLACE COUPLED WITH ANTICYCLONIC FLOW IN ALL LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
WINDY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO LAST THROUGH AT LEAST MONDAY NIGHT. 
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. EASTERLY FLOW 
WILL DEEPEN TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN 
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE. DESPITE THIS INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC 
MOISTURE...LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT SHOULD LIMIT POPS TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE CATEGORY TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.  

&&

.MARINE...
THE BIG BLOW HAS BEGUN. AT 100 AM EST...TWO SHIPS ON THE WATERS 20 
TO 60 NM SOUTH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS HAD REPORTED NORTHEAST 
WINDS OF 20 TO 25 KNOTS...WITH SEAS OF 7 TO 9 FEET. A SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY WILL BE REQUIRED FOR ALL KEYS WATERS TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST 
MONDAY NIGHT. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED FOR 
ATLANTIC WATERS...OR POSSIBLY ALL KEYS WATERS...TUESDAY. WINDS AND 
SEAS SHOULD DECREASE BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA (WINDS NEAR 20 KNOTS OR 
MORE AND/OR SEAS OF 7 FEET OR MORE) WEDNESDAY.

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED TODAY ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST 
FLIGHT ROUTE AND AT KEYS TERMINALS. THE MAIN IMPACTS TO AVIATION 
WILL BE 15 TO 20 KNOT AND GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS...PRODUCING ABOUT 15 
KNOTS OF CROSSWIND AT ISLAND RUNWAYS. ISOLATED MVFR SHOWERS WILL

930 PM EST FRI NOV 3 2006

.DISCUSSION...
A LARGE AND STRONG AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING INTO THE 
EASTERN UNITED STATES RESULTING IN INCREASING NORTHEASTERLY WINDS 
ACROSS OUR AREA...CURRENTLY 10 TO 15 MPH ON LAND...15 TO 20 KT ON 
THE BAY AND GULF WATERS...AND NEAR 20 KT ON THE ATLANTIC WATERS. 
SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY EXCEPT FOR CONSIDERABLE HIGH 
CLOUDINESS IN THE FORM OF A PERSISTENT CIRROSTRATUS DECK. 
TEMPERATURES ALONG THE ISLANDS ARE AROUND 78-80 DEGREES WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S. KBYX RADAR DETECTS ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS 
OVER THE OUTER STRAITS AND OVER THE GULF WATERS NORTHWEST OF DRY 
TORTUGAS. THE 00Z KEY WEST RAOB SHOWS NORTHEASTERLY FLOW FROM THE 
SURFACE TO ABOUT 7000 FT AGL...AND A VERY MOIST NEAR-SURFACE LAYER 
UP TO ABOUT 13000 FT AGL WITH DRIER AIR ABOVE.

.FORECAST...
SUMMARY...AS THE AFOREMENTIONED HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BUILDS OVER THE 
EASTERN U.S. TONIGHT OUR NORTHEASTERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO 
INCREASE...TO NEAR 20 MPH ALONG THE ISLANDS AND 20 TO 25 KT ON ALL 
KEYS WATERS BY MORNING...THEN TO NEAR 25 KT ON THE WATER BY 
AFTERNOON AND PERSISTING THROUGH THE WEEKEND. MARINE WINDS WILL NOT 
DECREASE APPRECIABLY UNTIL PERHAPS TUESDAY...AND EVEN THEN WILL 
LIKELY REMAIN NEAR 15 KT FOR MOST OF THE WEEK.

TONIGHT...KAMX RADAR IN MIAMI DETECTS AN AREA OF SHOWERS AROUND PALM 
BEACH COUNTY AND ADJACENT WATERS...MOVING QUICKLY SOUTHWEST IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH A WIND SURGE. THIS SURGE AND THE ACCOMPANYING 
SHOWERS WILL REACH OUR AREA LATER TONIGHT...THUS WILL STAND PAT WITH 
INHERITED 30 POPS. SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE CIRROSTRATUS 
DECK WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT US AT LEAST THROUGH TONIGHT...AND 
ALTHOUGH WINDS ARE CURRENTLY LOWER THAN ADVERTISED ON LAND THEY ARE 
INCREASING...AND SHOULD BE NEAR 20 MPH WITHIN A FEW HOURS. 
THEREFORE...NO UPDATES TO THE LOCAL FORECAST ARE ANTICIPATED.

IN THE MARINE FORECAST...WINDS ARE INCREASING BUT ARE STILL ONLY 15 
TO 20 KT ON THE BAY AND GULF WATERS. WILL CARRY OVER INHERITED 
TRANSITIONAL WORDING IN THESE ZONES IN THE UPDATE...BUT WILL START 
AT 20 TO 25 KT ON THE ATLANTIC AS THEY ARE VERY CLOSE TO THAT NOW. 
ALTHOUGH WINDS ARE CURRENTLY JUST BELOW SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY 
CRITERIA IN THE BAY AND GULF THEY COULD REACH THE THRESHOLD QUITE 
SOON...THUS THE ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN PLACE FOR ALL WATERS (LIKELY 
AT LEAST THROUGH MONDAY).

&&

.MARINE...
A LARGE STRONG HIGH PRESSURE AREA IS BUILDING INTO THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES...INCREASING WINDS ON ALL KEYS WATERS TO 20 TO 25 KT 
OVERNIGHT...AND NEAR 25 KT WITH HIGHER GUSTS (ESPECIALLY IN THE 
STRAITS) FROM SATURDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. NO SIGNIFICANT DECREASE 
IN WIND SPEED IS EXPECTED UNTIL AROUND TUESDAY...AND EVEN THEN THEY 
SHOULD REMAIN NEAR 15 KT THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK.

&&

.AVIATION...
A FEW SHOWERS CAN BE EXPECTED TO CREATE ISOLATED MVFR CONDITIONS 
ALONG THE KMIA-KMFL ROUTE TONIGHT...OTHERWISE VFR CONDITIONS WILL 
PREVAIL ACROSS THE AREA.  SURFACE WINDS WILL INCREASE TO 15 TO 20 
KNOTS WITH HIGHER GUSTS LATER TONIGHT AND REMAIN LIKE THAT THROUGH 
TOMORROW. FORTUNATELY...THE WINDS WILL BE NORTHEAST...WHICH LIMITS 
THE CROSSWIND COMPONENTS AT EYW AND ESPECIALLY AT MTH.

&&

.KEY WATCHES/WARNINGS/ADVISORIES...SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR 
INCREASING WINDS ON ALL KEYS WATERS...GMZ031>033-052>054-072>075.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS CONTINUE TO STREAM NE FROM THE CARIBBEAN AND 
YUCATAN AREA...TO OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS...WITH JUST TRANSITORY 
BREAKS AND THIN SPOTS. AT THIS TIME...A LARGE BATCH OF THICKER HIGH 
CLOUDS HAVE EMERGED FROM THE YUCATAN CHANNEL HEADING THIS WAY. 
MEANWHILE AT LOWER LEVELS...BATCHES OF SHOWERS AND EVEN A SMALL 
CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS ARE MOVING SOUTH OVER OUTER WATERS OF THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS...AND ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE MOVING SSW OVER THE SOUTH 
FLORIDA PENINSULA. NE WINDS ARE BLOWING 15-20 KT OVER KEYS WATERS
(CLOSER TO 20 KT AT DRY TORTUGAS). TO OUR NORTH...A SECONDARY FRONT 
IS SEEN ON SATELLITE MOVING SW ONTO THE ATLANTIC COAST BETWEEN PALM 
BEACH AND VERO BEACH...ACCOMPANIED BY A NEARLY SOLID LAYER OF LOW 
CLOUDS...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS ALONG AND BEHIND IT...A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE GULF STREAM...AND A NOTICEABLE WIND SURGE TO 
HIGHER SPEEDS. TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN STEADY SO FAR OVER THE 
KEYS...NEAR 80F AND NEAR 70F RESPECTIVELY. 

.FORECAST...
A WINDY PERIOD STILL APPEARS IN STORE STARTING TONIGHT AND 
CONTINUING AT LEAST INTO TUESDAY. TROUBLESOME CLOUDS AND THREAT OF 
SOME SHOWERS MUDDLES THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...MAYBE 
SATURDAY NIGHT AS WELL. DESPITE THE LARGE AND SOMEWHAT CHILLY HIGH 
PRESSURE AREA OVER THE EASTERN STATES...TEMPERATURES ARE NOT 
EXPECTED TO DIP APPRECIABLY BELOW NORMAL FOR THE KEYS. 

TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...MODELS ALL CONCUR THAT LARGE HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL EXPAND OVER THE EASTERN U.S. TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...PUMPING UP 
KEYS AREA WINDS OVERNIGHT...AND EVEN A BIT MORE SATURDAY INTO THE 
20-25 MPH AND GUSTY RANGE. HIGH CLOUDS WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO 
FEED NE OFF CONVECTION IN THE NW CARIBBEAN AND YUCATAN/BELIZE...
AND DIRTY UP KEYS SKIES A WHILE LONGER. ALSO...SOME OF THE SW MOVING 
SHOWERS OVER THE MAINLAND AND STRAITS MAY AFFECT THE KEYS TONIGHT.
A PROBLEM EXISTS FOR SATURDAY...IN THAT AN AREA OF HIGH 1000-850 MB 
(LOW LEVEL) MOISTURE IS SHOWN BY MODELS TO MOVE SSW TO THE KEYS.
I INTERPRET THIS AS RELATED TO THE SECONDARY FRONT NOW SEEN BACKING 
IN TOWARD PALM BEACH. I RE-UPPED POPS TO 30 PCT FOR SAT AS A RESULT.
GFS AND NAM MOS ALSO ARE RESPECTABLE 50 AND 40 PCT FOR SAT...SO
THE POP MAY NEED ANOTHER BOOST. 

SATURDAY NIGHT...ITS POSSIBLE...AND SUGGESTED BY THE GFS MODEL...
THAT A SLUG OF WETTER LOW LEVEL AIR MAY NOT HAVE PASSED ALL THE KEYS 
AREA...AND A BIT HIGHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS IS NEEDED FOR THE EVENING.
UNCERTAINTY ABOUNDS...AND 20 PCT POPS WILL BE RETAINED FOR NOW. 
WINDS SHOULD STAY AS IS...20-25 MPH. 

SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...SOME DRYING ABOVE 850 MB IS 
INDICATED...SO 10 TO 20 PCT POPS ARE IN LINE...AS SEEN AT THIS TIME.
WINDS STAY UP...AS PRESSURE REMAINS HIGH TO OUR NORTH. 

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...A GRADUAL RELAX IN WINDS TUESDAY BUT STILL 
IN THE BREEZY CATEGORY IS INDICATED BY THE EXTENDED GFS. 
SOME LOWER PRESSURE IN THE NW GULF MAY KEEP WINDS FROM GOING MUCH 
LIGHTER THAN 15 KT OVER WATERS THROUGH THE WEEK...AS DIRECTION TURNS 
TO SE. LOW POPS ARE RETAINED...20 PCT. 
&&

.MARINE...
LARGE AND STRONG HIGH PRESSURE IS NOW EXPANDING OVER THE EASTERN U.S.
AND THIS WILL PUMP KEYS WINDS UP TO NE 20-25 KT TONIGHT...CLOSER TO 
25 KT SATURDAY WITH EVEN HIGHER GUSTS OUT IN THE STRAITS. HIGH SEAS 
WILL BUILD MAYBE 10 FT OR SO...MORE IN THE GULF STREAM. NO LET UP IS 
SEEN UNTIL MAYBE TUESDAY WITH WINDS DOWN BY ONLY 5-10 KT...THEN
NO LESS THAN 15 KT WINDS SHOULD STICK AROUND THROUGH THE MID AND 
LATER PART OF THE WEEK. 
&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH 12Z...MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW 
FLIGHT ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS WILL OCCUR ALONG THE ROUTE...PRODUCING PERIODS OF MVFR CIGS 
AND/OR VIS. SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYS TERMINALS WILL AVERAGE 
030/12-16KTS WITH GUSTS OF 18-20KTS LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS 
EVENING...AND INCREASE OVERNIGHT TO 14-18KTS WITH GUSTS OF 20-26

.CURRENTLY...
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS CONTINUE TO STREAM NE FROM THE CARIBBEAN AND 
YUCATAN AREA...TO OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS. HOWEVER...THESE CLOUDS ARE 
SHOWING OCCASIONAL BREAKS OR THINNER SPOTS. VISIBLE SATELLITE 
SUGGESTS SOME INCREASE IN LOWER AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS IN A GENERAL 
BAND FROM THE COASTAL GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS...
ACROSS THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA...BUT SO FAR NO PRECIP IS SHOWING 
UP IN THESE WATERS. SHOWERS AND EVEN A FEW THUNDERSTORMS HAVE 
INCREASED OVER WATERS OF THE FLORIDA STRAITS OFFSHORE FROM THE UPPER 
AND MIDDLE KEYS...AND WELL SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. THOSE ECHOES 
OVER THE LOWER KEYS AND N-NE OF DRY TORTUGAS ARE CHAFF DROPS. THE 
SURFACE TROUGH IS WELL EAST AND SOUTH OF THE KEYS...AND A SECONDARY 
WIND SURGE IS PRESSING INTO SOUTH FLORIDA BUT ITS LEADING EDGE IS 
NOT WELL DEFINED. TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS ARE DROPPING A BIT NORTH OF 
PALM BEACH AND NAPLES. 

.FORECAST...
THE ONSET OF STRONGER WINDS IS HARD TO DEFINE FOR THE KEYS...BUT 
A GENERAL INCREASE IN WINDS SHOULD BE SEEN PRIOR TO THE DAYS END. 
MORE DIFFICULT IS OUR RAIN PROSPECTS. SOME SURFACE CONVERGENCE MAY 
AID SHOWER FORMATION WITH THE ONSET OF HIGHER WIND SPEEDS FROM THE 
NE...BUT THIS IS VAGUE. ALOFT...WINDS AT 850 MB UP TO 600 MB ARE 
FORECAST TO VEER FROM SSW EARLY THIS MORNING...TO N THROUGH NW BY 
LATE AFTERNOON. WHILE THIS WOULD SEEM TO THWART ENHANCED LIFT AND 
MOISTURE...THE VARIOUS MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS HAD HIGH CHANCE OF RAIN 
FOR THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THE NEW 12Z NAM-BASED MOS PUT OUT A 26 
PCT AMOUNT FOR THE 6-HOUR AFTERNOON PERIOD. AT NOON...ZONES WILL BE 
UPDATED FOR WIND TRANSITION...AND I MAY OR MAY NOT ADJUST POPS 
DEPENDING ON RADAR AND SATELLITE TRENDS. 
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS FROM THE N-NE ARE STILL EXPECTED TO PICK UP IN 
SPEED...REACHING AROUND 20 KT BY LATE AFTERNOON OR BEFORE SUN DOWN.
AN EXCEPTION IS WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST TO DRY TORTUGAS...AND NORTH 
OF KEY WEST TO THE MAINLAND...WHERE 20 KT WINDS ARE ALREADY IN 
EVIDENCE.

OVER AND AROUND THE KEYS TERMINALS. ALSO...ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL 
OCCUR ALONG THE ROUTE...MAINLY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF ROUTE OVER 
THE ATLANTIC WATERS...PRODUCING PERIODS OF MVFR CIGS AND/OR VIS. 
SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYS TERMINALS WILL AVERAGE 030/11-14KTS

KBYX DETECTS SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE 
AREA FROM OCEAN REEF TO THE DRY TORTUGAS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS 
NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE NORTHEAST NEAR 
10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHEAST NEAR 10 KNOTS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 70S. ONLY ABOUT EIGHT DEGREES OF WARMING 
IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER. 

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS 
TODAY. THE NAM AND GFS NUMERICAL MODELS KEEP LARGE SCALE LIFT NEAR 
THE KEYS OR JUST SOUTH OF THE KEYS TODAY. INCREASING NORTHEAST LOW 
LEVEL FLOW TODAY SHOULD KEEP THIS LARGE SCALE LIFT JUST SOUTH OF THE 
KEYS...CLOSER TO THE TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE. AS A RESULT...HIGH 
CHANCE POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR TODAY...WHICH IS BELOW ALL 
NUMERICAL MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHER IN 
THE FLORIDA STRAITS TODAY. HOLD ON TO YOUR HATS AS STRONG WINDS WILL 
DEVELOP TONIGHT AND PERSIST THROUGH AT LEAST THE WEEKEND. A LARGE 
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EAST CENTRAL UNITED STATES WILL BUILD 
ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA THIS AFTERNOON AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES SHOULD BE JUST BELOW ONE AND THREE 
QUARTERS OF AN INCH TONIGHT. ADEQUATE ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE FOR 
SHOWERS COUPLED WITH AN EXPECTED WIND SURGE IS ENOUGH TO RAISE POPS 
FROM SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY TO LOW CHANCE CATEGORY FOR TONIGHT. 
STRONG NORTHEAST WINDS SATURDAY SHOULD PUSH A DRIER AIR MASS OVER 
THE KEYS. BY SUNSET SATURDAY...PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE JUST ABOVE ONE 
AND ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR 
SATURDAY. THE SERVICE AREA WILL REMAIN ALONG THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY 
OF A LARGE ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE JUST ABOVE ONE INCH 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. POPS WILL BE DROPPED BY 10 PERCENT FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY DUE TO A DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE COUPLED 
WITH ANTICYCLONIC FLOW IN ALL LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.        

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
WINDY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO LAST THROUGH AT LEAST MONDAY NIGHT. 
PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH 
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. THE FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN 
ALONG THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF A LARGE ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER 
THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. POPS WILL 
BE DROPPED BY 10 PERCENT FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT DUE 
TO A DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE COUPLED WITH ANTICYCLONIC FLOW IN ALL 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
EXTEND ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. EASTERLY FLOW 
WILL DEEPEN TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY RESULTING IN AN INCREASE IN 
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE. DESPITE THIS INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC 
MOISTURE...LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT SHOULD LIMIT POPS TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE CATEGORY TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.

.MARINE...
MARINERS SHOULD BE BE PREPARED FOR A BIG BLOW THIS WEEKEND. 
NORTHEAST WINDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE TODAY. BY SUNSET THIS

.DISCUSSION...
THE LOW-LEVEL TROUGH THAT PASSED THROUGH THE KEYS TODAY CURRENTLY 
RESIDES NEAR OR JUST NORTH OF CUBA. STRONGER CONVECTION IS NOW 
FOCUSED ALONG THE NORTHERN COAST OF CUBA...WITH ONLY LIGHT 
STRATIFORM RAIN AFFECTING THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS AT THIS 
TIME. TEMPERATURES ALONG THE ISLANDS ARE IN THE LOW TO MID 70S UNDER 
CLOUDY SKIES. WINDS HAVE BECOME NORTH TO NORTHEAST AND DECREASED 
OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS...TO 5 TO 10 MPH ON LAND AND NEAR 10 KT ON 
THE WATER.

.FORECAST...
TONIGHT...SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES THAT A BROAD AREA OF HIGH 
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE REMAINS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED OVER OUR AREA...AND 
THE 00Z KEY WEST RAOB SHOWS A PWAT OF 2.05 INCHES AND A VIRTUALLY 
SATURATED ATMOSPHERE ABOVE 750 MB. LOW-LEVEL FLOW HAS BECOME NORTH 
TO NORTHEAST...WITH MAINLY SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT (ABOVE 10 KFT). THE 
AIRMASS SURROUNDING THE KEYS HAS BEEN WORKED OVER AND STABILIZED BY 
CONVECTION TODAY. WHILE THE LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE TROUGH IS GONE...AMPLE MOISTURE REMAINS FOR FURTHER RAIN 
OVERNIGHT...AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES A SHORTWAVE PULSE 
CROSSING THE GULF THAT MAY MOVE OVER US LATER TONIGHT. IN 
ADDITION...KBYX RADAR INDICATES STRONGER SHOWERS DEVELOPING WELL 
SOUTH AND WEST OF DRY TORTUGAS...POSSIBLY ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
APPROACH OF THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE...AND DESPITE THE 
STABILIZED ATMOSPHERE LINGERING LIGHT RAIN IS AFFECTING MUCH OF THE 
ISLAND CHAIN EVEN NOW. IN LIGHT OF ALL THIS...THE INHERITED 70 POPS 
LOOK GOOD...BUT THE HIGHEST CHANCE WILL LIKELY BE LATER TONIGHT.

THE WIND SPEEDS ARE MORE PROBLEMATIC. AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE 
TROUGH AXIS THIS AFTERNOON WINDS BECAME NORTH TO NORTHEAST NEAR 15 
MPH ON LAND AND 15 KT AND GUSTY ON THE WATER. HOWEVER...IN THE LAST 
FEW HOURS WINDS HAVE LIGHTENED CONSIDERABLY...AND ARE NOW 5 TO 10 
MPH ON LAND AND NEAR 10 KT ON THE WATER. FORECAST THINKING AS WELL 
AS COMPUTER MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN INCREASING WINDS TONIGHT 
AND TOMORROW AS A LARGE AND STRONG AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER 
THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. I CAN ONLY SURMISE THAT THE CURRENT 
LULL IN WINDS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE STABLIZED POST-CONVECTIVE 
AIRMASS OVERHEAD...AND THAT THE WINDS WILL INCREASE LATER TONIGHT AS 
THIS AIRMASS ADVECTS OR MIXES OUT.

I WILL UPDATE THE LOCAL FORECAST TO INITIALIZE WITH LOWER WINDS AND 
INTRODUCE TRANSITIONAL WORDING TO INCREASE THEM LATER...AND TO LOWER 
AND PUSH BACK SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM CHANCES. THE ONLY ANTICIPATED 
CHANGE TO THE MARINE FORECAST WILL BE TO LIKEWISE BEGIN WITH LOWER 
WINDS AND INTRODUCE TRANSITIONAL WORDING TO BRING THEM UP LATER 
TONIGHT.

TOMORROW...AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED 
STATES A NORTHEASTERLY WIND SURGE WILL PASS SOUTH THROUGH THE KEYS. 
THE MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT WINDS WILL BEGIN TO PICK UP 
IN THE MORNING...AND BE BLOWING PRETTY HARD BY THE EVENING. IN 
ADDITION...IT APPEARS THAT DEEP ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL PERSIST 
THROUGH MOST OF TOMORROW...AND THE SHORTWAVE MOVING NEAR OUR AREA 
COULD PROVIDE ADDITIONAL IMPETUS FOR CONVECTION. IN LIGHT OF 
THIS...WILL RAISE POPS SLIGHTLY TO 50 FOR TOMORROW IN THE UPCOMING 
UPDATE...WHICH IS STILL BELOW ALL MOS GUIDANCE.

A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE TROUGH HAS MOVED SE OVER THE KEYS...AND IS
EVIDENT ON DOPPLER RADAR IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS SOME 40 NM SE OF THE

TONIGHT...MODELS SUGGEST THAT ADDITIONAL MID LEVEL LIFT...AND 
CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE...WILL PERSIST OVER THE KEYS 
TONIGHT. IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS...IT WOULD SEEM THAT LARGE RAIN AREAS 
MIGHT STABILIZE THE AIRMASS A BIT. HOWEVER...NEW SHOWERS AND STORMS 
KEEP HEADING NNE FROM CUBA...AND IT IS UNKNOWN IF THEY WILL RIDE 
OVER THE SURFACE BOUNDARY AND REACH THE KEYS...OR IF NEW DEVELOPMENT 
WILL SET IN OVER THE KEYS LATER TONIGHT AS THE UPPER LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY ARRIVES. MODELS HAVE POPS OF 80 PCT (GFS)...50 PCT (NAM)
AND 90 PCT (NGM). I RAISED POPS TO 70 FOR ZONES...AND IF OVERALL

.CURRENTLY...
GOES-12 WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT TROPICAL MOISTURE 
PLUME STREAMING FROM THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN TO ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS. MEANWHILE...AN ACTIVE SUB-TROPICAL JET STREAM...IS 
ENHANCING DEEP MOISTURE OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE GULF OF 
MEXICO...AND INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. MEANWHILE...LATEST 
SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WELL PRONOUNCED TROPICAL WAVE OVER THE 
EXTREME WESTERN CARIBBEAN WITH A POORLY DEFINED TROUGH STRETCHING 
ACROSS CENTRAL CUBA...AND OVER THE UPPER KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA. 
ELSEWHERE...A STRENGTHENING AN EXPANSIVE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS 
BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHERN GREAT PLAINS. ACROSS THE MARINE 
DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS 
OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS...EXCEPT SOUTH WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS OVER THE 
UPPER KEYS AND THE ADJACENT WATERS. MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE 
INDICATING A GRADUAL INCREASE IN SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER THE NEARSHORE 
AND OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS...WITH 
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO AND ALONG THE 
CUBAN COAST. 

.SHORT TERM SYNOPSIS...
A DEEPENING MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED 
STATES AND GULF OF MEXICO WILL PROGRESS SWIFTLY EASTWARD THROUGH 
FRIDAY...AS A NEARLY STATIONARY SURFACE TROUGH LYING FROM THE 
EXTREME WESTERN CARIBBEAN TO NEAR THE UPPER KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA 
TODAY...EXITS SOUTHEASTWARD TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. MEANWHILE...WITHIN A 
CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT...A LARGE AND FAIRLY STRONG CONTINENTAL AREA OF 
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES WILL SLOWLY TRACK INTO 
THE EASTERN UNITED STATES THROUGH THIS WEEKEND. 

TODAY AND TONIGHT...
GIVEN AN ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE IN PLACE (PWAT 2.20 INCHES)...THE 
COMBINATION OF CONSIDERABLE MID AND UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE AND WEAK 
LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WILL WARRANT CATEGORICAL POPS TODAY. 
HOWEVER...A LACK OF BOTH INSOLATION AND STRONG LOW LEVEL FORCING 
WILL PROMPT ONLY ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THEREAFTER...DESPITE UPPER 
LEVEL DIVERGENCE LINGERING TONIGHT...LEFTOVER STRATIFORM RAIN SHOULD 
GRADUALLY DIMINISH TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AS LEVEL LEVEL DRIER AIR 
FILTERS IN. 

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...
WITH THE LOW LEVEL TROUGH EXITING FURTHER SOUTHEASTWARD AND AWAY 
FROM OUR REGION...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO TAKE HOLD OF 
OUR REGION. AFTER A BRIEF SPELL OF FRESH NORTH TO NORTHEAST 
WINDS...AN ADDITIONAL NORTHEAST WIND SURGE COMBINED WITH AMPLE LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE MAY PROVIDE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE TO WARRANT A 
BRIEF BOUT OF SCATTERED SHOWERS LATE FRIDAY OR FRIDAY NIGHT. 

SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
THE AFOREMENTIONED AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID 
ATLANTIC REGION WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT INTO THE WESTERN NORTH 
ATLANTIC...WITH A RIDGE REACHING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES. 
THIS EXTENSIVE REGION OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY SETTLE SOUTHWARD 
AND WEAKEN BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. ALTHOUGH STRONG LOW LEVEL 
STRONG NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS WILL ALLOW A GRADUAL LOWER 
TROPOSPHERIC MOISTENING...MID AND UPPER LEVEL SUBSIDENCE WILL PROMPT 
ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AT THIS TIME. 

&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BACK TO NORTH NORTHEAST 
AND SLOWLY INCREASE LATE TODAY...AND TONIGHT. HOWEVER...MARINERS 
SHOULD BE AWARE THAT WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE HIGHER NEAR INCREASING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY. THEREAFTER...GENTLE TO MODERATE 
NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS LATE TONIGHT WILL BECOME MOSTLY NORTHEAST 
AND INCREASE SIGNIFICANTLY FRIDAY AND PERSIST THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...AND INTO NEXT WEEK. SUBSEQUENTLY...A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY 
WILL BE REQUIRED ON ALL KEYS WATERS BEGINNING FRIDAY WITH THE 
LIKELIHOOD OF THESE CONDITIONS CONTINUING FOR SEVERAL DAYS.  
&&

.AVIATION...
PLENTY OF TROPICAL MOISTURE MAY RESULT IN A LOW STRATUS CLOUD DECK 
DEVELOPING JUST BEFORE SUNRISE THIS MORNING AT KEYW AND KMTH. THERE 
IS A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF IFR CEILINGS EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH...SO ONLY SCATTERED LOW STRATUS 
CLOUDS WILL BE INDICATED IN THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINAL FORECASTS FOR 
EARLY THIS MORNING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD INCREASE IN 
INTENSITY AND COVERAGE NEAR THE KEYS LATE THIS MORNING INTO THIS 
AFTERNOON. THEREFORE...LONG-LIVED IFR CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE AT 
KEYW AND KMTH LATE THIS MORNING INTO THIS AFTERNOON. IFR CONDITIONS 
WILL AFFECT 25 PERCENT OR LESS OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE TODAY.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1000 PM EST WED NOV 1 2006

.DISCUSSION...
EVENING UPPER-AIR OBSERVATION FROM KEY WEST IS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS 
EVENING AS LIGHT SOUTHERLY WINDS FROM 2000 THROUGH 14000 FEET 
CONTINUE TO FEED IN TROPICAL AIRMASS. PRECIPITABLE WATERS HAVE 
REACHED 2.08 INCHES...AND IT IS CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE BELOW 600 MB. 
DEEP CONVECTION IS LIMITED BUT HAS MIGRATED NORTH OF CENTRAL CUBA 
WITH TOPS IN EXCESS OF 40K FEET AND SHOWING A SLOW PROPAGATION 
NORTHWARD ALONG ITS OUTFLOW. THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE IS DOMINATED BY A 
LARGE ANTICYCLONE OVER JAMAICA...AND A BROAD TROUGH ACROSS THE NORTH 
CENTRAL U.S. WESTERLY FLOW ABOVE 400 MB CONTINUES WITH SPEEDS 
EXCEEDING 50 KNOTS OUT OF THE WEST-SOUTHWEST OVER KEY WEST. 

CLOSER TO THE SURFACE...A TROUGH CONTINUES FROM THE NORTHWEST 
CARIBBEAN ACROSS THE STRAITS AND SOUTH FLORIDA TO OFFSHORE EAST 
CENTRAL FLORIDA. THE TROUGH APPEARS WEAK OVER THE STRAITS WITH NOT A 
LOT OF CONVERGENCE OVER THE KEYS. A WEAK BUT TIGHT LOW PRESSURE 
CIRCULATION DEVELOPED EARLIER AND MOVED NORTHEAST OF CAPE CANAVERAL. 
THIS APPEARS TO HAVE SHARPENED THE TROUGH AND ALLOWED A QUITE A 
VARIETY OF WIND DIRECTIONS EARLIER THIS EVENING FROM CONVECTION OVER 
SOUTHEAST FLORIDA AND INFLOW TOWARDS THE COASTAL LOW. THESE 
INFLUENCES ARE WANING ACROSS THE UPPER KEYS WITH SURFACE WINDS VERY 
LIGHT NORTHERLY AT 5 KNOTS OR LESS. ACROSS THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS 
AND OUT TO DRY TORTUGAS...A STEADY NORTHEAST WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS 
HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED. A CRUISE SHIP 60 MILES SOUTH OF KEY WEST 
REPORTED NORTHEAST WINDS ABOVE BRIDGE LEVEL AT 13 KNOTS AT 700 PM.

NO CHANGES ARE ANTICIPATED FOR THE PUBLIC FORECAST TONIGHT AS 
CONVERGENCE ALONG THE TROUGH REMAINS WEAK...WHILE THE THERMODYNAMICS 
OF THE LOWER TO MID LEVELS WITH WESTERLIES ALOFT WILL SUPPORT 
INCREASING CLUSTERS OF CONVECTION OVERNIGHT. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL 
REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF CONVECTION...ALTHOUGH SHALLOWER THE FURTHER 
NORTH ONE GOES. SLOW MOVEMENT AND DEEP MOISTURE MEAN SOME OF THE 
HEAVIER SHOWERS MAY PRODUCE LOCALIZED HEAVY DOWNPOURS. AT THIS TIME 
COVERAGE IS ISOLATED TO SCATTERED AND CURRENT HIGH CHANCE POPS ARE 
HOLDING.
&&

.MARINE...
OTHER THAN A DIRECTIONAL TWEAK...THE RETREATING LOW PRESSURE EAST OF 
CENTRAL FLORIDA SHOULD ALLOW WINDS ACROSS ALL THE MARINE AREA TO 
BECOME LIGHT EAST TO NORTHEAST. THE SURFACE TROUGH IS WEAK BUT ITS 
LOCATION MAY CAUSE WINDS TO BE VARIABLE AT TIMES OVERNIGHT. MARINERS 
SHOULD BE AWARE OF INCREASING COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
TOWARD DAYBREAK AND LASTING THROUGH THURSDAY. HOWEVER...LARGE AND 
STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING TOWARD 

WINDS SHOULD SETTLE TO MAINLY EAST 10-15KT ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT. SHOWER COVERAGE WILL LIKELY INCREASE TOWARD DAYBREAK AND 
SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP AS WELL.
&&

.AVIATION...
THE FLYING WEATHER IS NOT GREAT TONIGHT. HUMIDITY IS VERY HIGH AND 
WE OCCASIONALLY OBSERVE IFR CIGS AT 5OO FEET AND WE CAN EXPECT FOG 
OR MIST ALONG THE ROUTE. IN ADDITION WDLY SCT MVFR CIGS AND VSBYS IN 
SHOWERS WILL BE LIKELY BY SUNRISE ALONG WITH ISOLD IFR CIGS AND 
VSBYS IN THUNDERSTORMS. CELL MOVEMENT WILL BE APPROX 22010KT WITH 
MOST TOPS AOB FL350.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
BASED ON 1 PM SURFACE SYNOPTIC REPORTS...AN ILL-DEFINED SURFACE 
TROUGH STILL SEEMS TO BE LOCATED FROM THE YUCATAN CHANNEL EXTENDING 
NORTHEAST TO JUST WEST OF DRY TORTUGAS. NARROW LINES OF SHOWERS 
CONTAINING ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALIGNED NE-SW ON THE WEST SIDE 
OF THIS TROUGH...WHILE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THIS TROUGH DISORGANIZED 
CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS EARLIER MOVED 
NORTHWEST OVER WATERS AROUND LOWER KEYS TO DRY TORTUGAS. WIND FLOW 
IN THE LOWER KEYS AND WESTWARD CURRENTLY IS ERRATIC DUE TO OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES AND STABILIZED AIR LAID DOWN BY THE EARLIER CONVECTION.
THAT CONVECTION WAS HEAVIEST IN THE KEY WEST AREA...BUT ALSO OTHER 
SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE OCCURRED AROUND THE REST OF THE LOWER AND 
MIDDLE KEYS. KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR WIND PROFILE NOW SHOWS A DEEP 
SOUTHERLY FLOW FROM JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE UP TO 20 THSD FT...WITH 
WIND SPEEDS NOT STRONG...AROUND 10 KT OR SO. THIS PATTERN SUGGESTS A
WEAK BUT DEEP LAYERED TROUGH TO THE WEST OF THE AREA. AND...LARGE 
THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS ARE COVERING THE NW CARIBBEAN JUST OFFSHORE 
FROM THE YUCATAN...WHERE A TROPICAL WAVE IS ANALYZED. 

.FORECAST...
THE BIG PICTURE STILL PAINTS A RELATIVELY WET AND CLOUDY PERIOD
TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY AND PERHAPS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT...FOLLOWED
BY LOWER CHANCES OF RAIN BUT ACCOMPANIED BY THE ONSET OF STRONG 
NORTHEAST WINDS FRIDAY WHICH WILL POTENTIALLY LAST UNTIL WEDNESDAY 
OF NEXT WEEK. 

TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...ALL OPERATIONAL MODELS SQUEEZE OUT 
PRECIPITATION FIELDS SURROUNDING THE KEYS TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...
AND MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS HAVE RELATIVELY HIGH POPS IN THE 50-70 
PCT RANGE FOR THE TWO 12 HOUR PERIODS. MOISTURE HAS ALREADY 
INCREASED OVER THE REGION OF COURSE. THE GFS MODE STILL SHOWS MODELS 
LARGE SCALE LIFT OVER THE KEYS BUT WITH POCKETS OF OBVIOUS 
CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK STILL IN EVIDENCE. THE NAM MODEL HAS LARGE SCALE 
LIFT OVER THE REGION LATE TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. WHILE A DEEP 
SOUTHERLY FLOW MAY BRING ENHANCE SLUGS OF MOISTURE UP FROM THE 
CARIBBEAN AND PERHAPS DIURNALLY GENERATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
FROM CUBA...AND WHILE THERE IS A WEAK TROUGH TO OUR WEST...ON THE 
WHOLE THERE REMAINS NO WELL-DEFINED FOCUS MECHANISM FOR TRIGGERING 
CONVECTION. THERE IS STILL, HOWEVER, RELATIVELY STRONG WINDS 
FORECAST TO BLOW AT HIGH LEVELS (200-300 MB)...AND THE NAM NOW 
GENERATES SIGNIFICANT DIVERGENT FIELDS AT HIGH LEVELS OVER THE KEYS. 
IN SHORT...I HAVE RAISED POPS TO LIKELY CATEGORY FOR THURSDAY...
50 PCT IS RETAINED FOR TONIGHT BUT MAY NEED UPPING LATER ON
DEPENDING ON WHAT FLINGS NORTH FROM CUBA. FINALLY...SURFACE WIND 
FIELDS SHOULD RECOVER TO ESE TONIGHT...BUT MAY BE VARIABLE EARLY 
THURSDAY. THE GFS SHOWS THE TROUGH SWINGING BACK SE OVER THE KEYS IN 
THE AFTERNOON...TAKING AREA WINDS TO A GENERAL NORTH DIRECTION...
AND THIS FEATURE COULD POSE A BIT OF SURFACE CONVERGENCE FOR 
SHOWERS.

THURSDAY NIGHT...A TRANSITION NIGHT MAY STILL HAVE SHOWERS 
AROUND...BUT FOR NOW I WILL HOLD THE 30 PCT POPS THAT ARE ONGOING. 
N TO NE WINDS ARE SHOWN TO INCREASE TO 15 MPH OR SO ON ISLANDS. 

FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...HUGE HIGH PRESSURE IS STILL EXPECTED TO 
EXPAND OVER THE EASTERN U.S. TO FLORIDA...PUMPING UP WINDS FRIDAY TO 
20 MPH OR MORE...AND CONTINUING UNTIL A BIT OF LESS WIND WEDNESDAY. 
MODELS SHOW SOME VERY SLIGHT LOW LEVEL COOLING...BUT GFS OUTPUT DOES 
NOT TAKE TEMPS BELOW THE CLIMO FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. LOWER LEVEL 
MOISTURE STILL IN PLACE DICTATES KEEPING 20 PCT POPS. 
&&

.MARINE...
EXCEPT FOR GUSTINESS AROUND SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WHICH MAY 
BECOME PREVALENT TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...WINDS SHOULD STAY 10 KT OR 
UNDER TONIGHT AND MOST OF THURSDAY. I APOLOGIZE FOR THE UNCERTAINTY 
ON WIND DIRECTION LATE TONIGHT AND THE FIRST PART OF THURSDAY...
WHERE SE TO S WINDS MAY JUMP AROUND TO NE. BUT LATE THU...A N TO NE 
WIND SHOULD SET IN...10 KT OR SO...INCREASING THU NIGHT. 

MAKE PLANS FOR STRONG NE WINDS FRIDAY CONTINUING WELL INTO NEXT WEEK
WHICH WILL REQUIRE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. WIDELY 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE LOCAL MVFR 
CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE...AND A FEW BRIEF IFR CONDITIONS IN 
STRONGER CELLS. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AT

AN ILL-DEFINED SURFACE TROUGH WOULD SEEM TO EXTEND NORTH-NORTHEAST 
FROM THE YUCATAN CHANNEL TO JUST WEST OF THE FLORIDA KEYS... 
PRODUCING A LIGHT E-SE WIND FLOW AT KEYS AREA WIND GAUGES. 
THE PRESSURE PATTERN MAY BE WEAKER OVER FLORIDA BAY AND GULF WATERS 
NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS...GIVING A SOMEWHAT VARIABLE WIND PATTERN TO 
THOSE WATERS. MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY HAVE OBVIOUSLY INCREASED 
SINCE THIS TIME YESTERDAY. THE MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED NEARLY 
SATURATED AIR FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 15 THSD FT. LARGE CLUSTERS OF

GFS APPEARS TO HAVE SERIOUS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK PROBLEMS...AND 
THEREFORE...SEEMS TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH ITS OMEGA FIELDS AND

SIGNIFICANT MOISTENING DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS. SURFACE DEWPOINTS 
ARE NOW IN THE MID 70S ACROSS THE LOCAL ISLANDS AND REEFS...WITH AIR 
TEMPERATURES HOLDING AROUND 80F...INDICATIVE OF A MARITIME TROPICAL 
AIR MASS. SINCE MONDAY EVENING...MEAN WIND FLOW IN THE SFC-700MB 
LAYER HAS VEERED ABOUT 90 DEGREES WHICH ALLOWED FOR TRANSPORT OF 
TROPICAL AIR INTO THE REGION EARLIER TODAY. THE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC 
GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT PATTERN ACROSS THE AREA IS DOMINATED BY A 
RAPIDLY MODIFYING CONTINENTAL ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN 
NORTH ATLANTIC NORTHEAST OF THE BAHAMAS...AND A TROPICAL WAVE OVER 
THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN. THE TROPICAL WAVE AXIS EXTENDS NORTH FROM 
HONDURAS TO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. ACCORDING TO EVENING 
UPPER-AIR OBSERVATIONS A MOIST AND UNSTABLY STRATIFIED AIR MASS NOW 
COVERS MOST OF SOUTH FLORIDA...ALL OF THE BAHAMAS AND GREATER 
ANTILLES...AS WELL AS PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
HOWEVER...DEEP MOIST CONVECTION HAS BEEN LIMITED TO MOSTLY WITHIN 
200 MILES EAST OF THE TROPICAL WAVE AXIS OVER THE CARIBBEAN...WHERE 
VORTICITY/CONVERGENCE/VERTICAL MOTION FIELDS ARE STRONGEST. EARLIER 
TODAY...ISOLATED DEEP CONVECTIVE CELLS WERE NOTED OVER PORTIONS OF 
ANDROS ISLAND AND CUBA...ASSOCIATED WITH SEA-BREEZE CIRCULATIONS. 
LATEST KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW A CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS 
HAVING MOVED NORTH FROM CUBA AND APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY 
OF GMZ075. ONLY ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS ARE FOUND ELSEWHERE ACROSS 
THE SERVICE AREA.

THE OVERNIGHT FORECAST WILL MAINTAIN SCATTERED SHOWER/STORM COVERAGE 
OVER WATER...WITH A 30 PERCENT POP OVER LAND ZONES. GRIDS/ZFP/PFM 
WILL BE UPDATED TO INDICATE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER OVER LAND AS 
WELL DUE TO THE OBSERVED INSTABILITY. THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING 
INDICATED MLCAPE VALUES NEAR 1200 J/KG...LIFTED INDEX OF -2.5C...AND 
ML CONVECTIVE INHIBITION OF ONLY 2 J/KG. SOME OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES 
FROM AFTERNOON BAHAMIAN AND CUBAN CONVECTION MAY SERVE TO INITIATE 
SOME DEEPER CONVECTIVE CELLS OVERNIGHT.
&&

.MARINE...

OVERNIGHT. SHOWER COVERAGE WILL LIKELY INCREASE TOWARD DAYBREAK AND 
SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP AS WELL.

.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH AXIS IS STILL DIFFICULT TO FIND...BUT MAY 
EXTEND SOUTH-NORTH NEAR OR OVER THE KEYS AT THIS TIME. WINDS HAVE 
GONE ESE AT UPPER KEYS SITES...STILL ARE E OR ENE ELSEWHERE...
WITH SPEEDS 10 KT OR 10-15 KT EXCEPT FOR LONG KEY ON FLORIDA BAY 
WHICH MAY BE CLOSE TO THE WAVE AXIS. OVER THE KEYS AREA...NO
ORGANIZED SHOWERS ARE SEEN IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS TROUGH...BUT
ISOLATED SHOWERS WITHIN SMALL CLOUD LINES HAVE APPEARED THIS 
AFTERNOON. MEANWHILE...A TROPICAL WAVE WITH A BETTER DEFINED SURFACE 
TROUGH IS ANALYZED OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN DUE SOUTH OF THE KEYS...
WITH CLUSTERS OF THUNDERSTORMS ALONG AND EAST OF THE WAVE AXIS. 
GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS DRY AIR ALOFT STILL IN PLACE OVER THE 
KEYS...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES STILL ONLY AROUND 1.4 INCHES. 

.FORECAST...
ACTUALLY...THE LONGER TERM PERIODS FROM FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY... 
DURING WHICH BREEZY TO WINDY CONDITIONS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO SET 
IN...SEEM TO HAVE MORE CERTAINTY THAN THE NEAR TERM. THE PERIOD 
TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY IS STILL CHARACTERIZED BY DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN MODELS...WILD SWINGS IN MODELS PRECIPITATION PATTERNS...
AND DIFFERENCES IN WIND FIELDS. 

TONIGHT...MODELS ALL INCREASE MOISTURE OVER THE KEYS TONIGHT...WITH 
GFS THE MOST. BUT...THE GFS DEEPEST MOISTURE AND LARGE SCALE LIFT 
ARE NOT SEEN UNTIL WEDNESDAY...SO THE LATEST MOS OUTPUT OF THE GFS 
WITH ITS VERY HIGH PROBABILITY OF PRECIP FOR TONIGHT IS PUZZLING. 
I WILL MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH ONGOING FORECASTS OF 30 PCT. THE 
LATEST NAM...AND NOW THE GFS TOO...SHOW A VERY BROAD LOW LEVEL 
TROUGH MOVING WEST OVER THE KEYS...NOT AS SHARP AS PRIOR GFS RUNS. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...GFS MODEL PRODUCES LARGE FIELDS OF 
UPWARD VERTICAL VELOCITIES FROM THE NW CARIBBEAN-ACROSS CUBA-TO THE 
KEYS. AND WITH THIS...THE GFS UNLOADS LARGE AREAS OF PRECIP OVER THE 
REGION INCLUDING THE KEYS. FROM LATE WED THROUGH EARLY THU...GFS 
OMEGA AND PRECIP FIELDS TAKE ON A TYPICAL CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK 
PATTERN. GFS MOS POPS HAVE ZOOMED UP TO 80 PCT FOR BOTH WED AND WED 
NIGHT...60 PCT FOR THU. NONETHELESS...WITHIN THIS OVERALL TIME 
FRAME...THE NAM MODEL AS WELL AS THE GFS BOTH INDICATE A STRONGLY 
DIFFLUENT 200-300 MB FLOW SETTING IN OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN...W 
CUBA...AND THE KEYS. THE MODELS ANALYZE SIGNIFICANT DIVERGENCE 
FIELDS OVER THIS DIFFLUENT ZONE. FOR NOW...I WILL CONSERVATIVELY 
INCREASE 12-HOUR POPS BY JUST 10 PCT...GOING UP TO 50 PCT...FOR WED 
NIGHT AND THU BASED ON THE NAM LARGE SCALE ASCENT. DEFINING SURFACE 
WINDS FOR THE PERIOD IS ALSO A PROBLEM...PARTICULARLY FOR WED NIGHT.
WITH A WEAK TROUGH NEARBY...WIND SPEEDS OUGHT NOT TO EXCEED 10 OR 15 
KT...AND MAY EITHER BE MAINLY E OR GO VARIABLE WED NIGHT DEPENDING 
ON THE MODEL. 

THU NIGHT...A TURN OF WIND FLOW TO NW THEN N IS NOW INDICATED BY 
MODELS AS THE WEAK TROUGH SWINGS BACK EAST OF THE KEYS. 30 PCT POPS 
ARE CARRIED SINCE DRYING IS NOT YET SHOWN TO ARRIVE AT THE KEYS. 

FRI...N TO NE WINDS SHOULD SET IN WITH INCREASING SPEEDS AS HIGH 
PRESSURE EXPANDS OVER THE EASTERN STATES AND DOWN THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA. AND...DRYING ALOFT SHOULD ARRIVE AS WELL. 

FRI NIGHT THROUGH TUE...A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT IS AGREED UPON BY 
ALL MODELS IN THE EXTENDED TIME FRAME...PRODUCING MAINLY NE OR ENE 
WINDS 20 MPH OR HIGHER. SEE MARINE SECTION. ONLY SLIGHT COOLING IS 
SEEN FOR SAT AND SUN. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO MOVE WEST...KEEPING KEYS AREA 
WINDS MAINLY FROM THE EAST IN THE 10-15 KT RANGE OVERNIGHT AND INTO 
WED. WINDS ARE UNCERTAIN WED NIGHT...BUT ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE OVER 
10 KT EXCEPT FOR LOCAL GUSTINESS NEAR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
A LARGE AND STRONG HIGH PRESSURE AREA IS EXPECTED TO EXPAND OVER 
FLORIDA STARTING THU NIGHT AND FRI. AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS THAT 
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES MAY BE POSTED SOME TIME FRI OR FRI NIGHT... 
WITH STRONG NE WINDS SETTING IN AND LASTING THROUGH THE WEEKEND INTO 
NEXT WEEK. 
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT ALONG THE 
MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE AND AT THE KEYS TERMINALS. THE MAIN

THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED A SLIGHT WARMING AND 
MOISTENING OF THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE AS COMPARED TO THE OBSERVATION 
FROM 24 HOURS AGO. A SURFACE ANALYSIS AT 02Z SHOWED A 1022MB HIGH 
PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC EAST OF THE 
CAROLINAS. MODERATE TO FRESH NORTHEAST TO EAST BREEZES HAVE 
PREVAILED ACROSS THE WATERS SURROUNDING THE FLORIDA KEYS WITH 
SLIGHTLY LOWER SPEEDS OVER LAND. LATEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS CROSSING PORTIONS OF MIAMI-DADE COUNTY...FLORIDA

.CURRENTLY...
THE CENTER OF SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE (1022 MB) HAS SCOOTED EAST AND 
NOW LIES JUST OFFSHORE FROM THE GEORGIA-SOUTH CAROLINA COASTS...
AND ITS CIRCULATION CONTINUES TO DRIVE NE BREEZES OVER THE KEYS.
VISIBLE IMAGE SATELLITE LOOPING SHOWS A BROAD CYCLONIC TURNING OF 
LOW LEVEL CLOUDS...SUGGESTING A SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDING SW OVER THE 
CENTRAL BAHAMAS...THENCE ACROSS CUBA AND INTO THE NW CARIBBEAN JUST 
WEST OF JAMAICA. THROUGH THE BAHAMAS THIS TROUGH MARKS THE STALLING 
POINT OF A FRONTAL TROUGH...WHILE IN THE CARIBBEAN A TROPICAL WAVE
HAS MOVED TO THE APPARENT TROUGH POSITION WEST OF JAMAICA. WATER 
VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE EASTERN EDGE OF RIGHT OVER THE KEYS. A MUCH 
MORE MOIST AIRMASS LIES ALONG AND EAST OF THE TROUGH...PRODUCING 
THUNDERSTORMS FROM THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS TO CENTRAL CUBA. AT THE 
SURFACE...DEWPOINTS IN THE KEYS REMAIN IN THE MID 60S...NOT HAVING 
COME UP YET FROM THIS MORNING. 

.DISCUSSION...
THE OPERATIONAL MODELS STILL DIFFER WITH REGARD TO DETAILS OF A 
LINGERING SURFACE TO MID LEVEL TROUGH NEAR OR JUST EAST OF THE KEYS 
THROUGH THURSDAY. I WILL MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH ONGOING 
FORECASTS...SHOWING AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
DURING THE TIME FRAME FROM LATE TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY NIGHT.

THEN...FOR EXTENDED PERIODS...THE GFS MODEL AND THE EUROPEAN MODEL 
BOTH INDICATE A RE-NEWED SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SURGE OVER THE 
EASTERN U.S. ...PRESSING THROUGH THE KEYS FRIDAY...AND PRODUCING A 
PERSISTENT BREEZY PERIOD AT LEAST THROUGH NEXT MONDAY. 

TONIGHT...MODELS ARE A LITTLE SLOWER TO BRING DEEP MOISTURE WEST TO 
THE KEYS...BUT NONETHELESS SHOW AN OVERALL INCREASE IN RELATIVE 
HUMIDITY VALUES IN THE LAYER SURFACE TO 8 THSD FT AGL TONIGHT. 
MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS (MOS) HAVE BACKED OFF PROBABILITY OF PRECIP 
(POP) FOR TONIGHT A BIT...WITH GFS SHOWING 30 PCT...NAM AND NGM EACH 
20 PCT. ILL INDICATE 30 PCT...SPECIFYING LATE NIGHT AT THE 
ISLANDS...ANY TIME IN THE STRAITS. NE WINDS 15 MPH OUGHT TO KEEP 
TEMPS IN THE MID 70S. 

TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...MODELS HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT WITH 
THIS PERIOD DUE TO ERRATIC HANDLING OF WEAK LOW PRESSURE WAVES THAT 
MAY OR MAY NOT FORM ON THE FRONTAL TROUGH THAT BACKS UP TO NEAR THE 
KEYS. MEANWHILE...THE NAM CONTINUES TO GO CRAZY WITH TROPICAL 
CYCLONE FORMATION IN THE NW CARIBBEAN. AFTERNOON ZONES WILL MAINTAIN 
CONTINUITY WITH ONGOING FORECASTS FOR THIS PERIOD...SHOWING 40 PCT 
POPS FOR EACH 12 HOUR PERIOD. THE GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT THE 
FRONTAL TROUGH FROM SURFACE TO 700 MB WILL SHIFT WEST TO NEAR THE 
KEYS...WHILE THE TROPICAL WAVE OVER THE CARIBBEAN SHEARS AWAY TO THE 
WEST. SOME MODEST PERIODS OF ISENTROPIC LIFT AT THE 310K LEVEL 
(AROUND 700 MB)...AND SOME WEAK PERIODS OF VERTICAL VELOCITIES ARE 
INDICATED BY THE MODELS...WHILE MOISTURE INCREASES WITH PW VALUES
NEAR 1.9 INCH. WHILE GFS POPS GO UP TO 50-60 PCT FOR TUE NIGHT 
THROUGH WED NIGHT...ILL HOLD ONTO CURRENT 40 PERCENTERS. NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN DAILY TEMPERATURE RANGE IS EXPECTED...MID 70S 
TO MID 80S...UNLESS A HEAVY SHOWER DOUSES SOME AREAS. 

FRIDAY...GFS MODEL AND EUROPEAN MODEL SHOW A RATHER STRONG HIGH 
PRESSURE SURGE REACHING THE KEYS FROM THE NORTH...PUSHING MOISTURE 
TO THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST...AND SENDING IN STRONGER N TO NE WINDS AT 
LOW LEVELS. NO WELL-DEFINED FRONT IS INDICATED WITH THIS FEATURE...
BUT IS ALMOST NORTHEAST-MONSOON-LIKE IN NATURE. THE CURRENT GFS 
MODEL MAY BE A BIT FASTER WITH THIS FEATURES ARRIVAL INTO THE 
KEYS...SO I WILL HOLD ONTO THE IDEA OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND MAYBE A 
THUNDERSTORM EARLY BEFORE STABLE AIR SETS IN. 

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...STRONG N TO NE WINDS ARE SHOWN THROUGH 
THE PERIOD DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH. ONLY A SLIGHT DROP IN 
TEMPS IS CURRENTLY NOTED IN THE EXTENDED GFS MODEL...TO NEAR NORMAL 
ACTUALLY. 20 PCT POPS ARE RETAINED SINCE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE BACK IN AFTER A SHORT-LIVED LOW LEVEL DRYING SPELL
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. 
&&

.MARINE...
SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION ON ATLANTIC/FLORIDA STRAITS 
WATERS ADJACENT TO THE KEYS THROUGH TONIGHT. NE WINDS STILL BLOWING 
15-20 KT (MAYBE HIGHER GUSTS OUT IN THE STRAITS) WILL KEEP SEAS HIGH 
AS WELL. MODELS SHOW PERHAPS A MINOR DROP IN WIND SPEEDS TUESDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY...TO NEAR 15 KT BUT GUSTY AT TIMES. A FRONTAL 
TROUGH...NOW STALLED OVER THE BAHAMAS...IS FORECAST TO MOVED BACK TO 
NEAR THE KEYS. UNCERTAINTY ON HOW CLOSE THE TROUGH WILL BE...LEAVES
A QUESTION MARK FOR WINDS TUE THROUGH THU. IF THE TROUGH AXIS COMES 
OVER OR VERY NEAR TO THE KEYS...WIND SPEEDS MAY DROP MORE 
SIGNIFICANTLY FOR A DAY OR SO WED-THU. WATCH OUT FOR THE COMING 
WEEKEND. A SURGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN STATES TO FLORIDA
MAY CAUSE WINDS TO JUMP UP FRIDAY (FROM THE N TO NE) AND PERSIST THE 
WHOLE WEEKEND...WITH AN EXERCISE CAUTION OR EVEN SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY HEADLINES REQUIRED EVENTUALLY.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS MOVING EASTWARD ALONG THE SOUTHEASTERN 
STATES. RESULTING WINDS HAVE BEEN MAINLY NORTHEAST AT AROUND 10 TO 
15 MPH ACROSS MOST ISLAND LOCATIONS. MARINE LOCATIONS ARE REPORTING 
MOSTLY NEAR 15 KNOTS AND GUSTY. MODERATE WINDS AND A STRONG AND LOW 
TEMPERATURE INVERSION HAS PRODUCED PATCHES OF STRATOCU ACROSS THE 
KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. NO SHOWERS HAVE BEEN DETECTED ACROSS 
KEYS WATERS THUS FAR TODAY. TEMPERATURES HAVE COME UP INTO THE MID 
70S. GPS SENSORS INDICATE THE PWAT OVER THE KEYS IS HANGING IN 
AROUND .7 INCHES. MOISTURE IS ABOUT TWICE AS HIGH OUT OVER THE 
STRAITS...WHERE A DYING COLD FRONT IS STALLED.

.FORECAST...
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...THE LAST REMAINS OF THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF WILL LIFT OUT...LEAVING THE KEYS 
AREA IN A NEAR ZONAL FLOW BETWEEN A RIDGE OVER THE CARIBBEAN AND A 
BROAD TROUGH OVER THE CONUS. MEANWHILE THE SURFACE HIGH TO OUR NORTH 
WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT EASTWARD...INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC ON 
MONDAY. THE MOISTURE REMNANTS OF THE COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO WORK 
ITS WAY BACK OVER THE KEYS THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS...AS WINDS AT 
THE SURFACE BECOME MORE EAST NORTHEASTERLY...AND IN THE LOWER TROP 
MORE SOUTHERLY. MODERATE ISENTROPIC LIFT IS DEPICTED ON THE 305K 
SURFACE.

TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINT TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY MODERATE 
DURING THIS PERIOD. THE WATER IN THE STRAITS IS STILL IN THE LOW TO 
MID 80S. THE TEMPERATURE INVERSION WILL DISAPPEAR TONIGHT AS THIS 
MODERATION OCCURS. THESE FACTORS TOGETHER SHOULD RESULT IN POPS 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN CLIMO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THESE 
ENVIRONMENTAL FEATURES WILL DOMINATE KEYS WEATHER THROUGH AT LEAST 
THE FIRST HALF OF THIS WEEK...RESULTING IN SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMO 
POPS...AND MODERATING TEMPERATURES THROUGH THIS PERIOD. GUIDANCE 
CONTINUES TO INDICATE SEVERAL LOWS MOVING OUT OF THE CARIBBEAN AT 
VARIOUS TIMES OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEK. THESE ARE TIED TO 
MIGRATORY UPPER LEVEL IMPULSES AND CLUSTERS OF CONVECTION. WILL 
CURRENTLY SMOOTH THROUGH THESE AS THEY APPEAR TO BE OVER DONE.

THESE RIPPLES ALONG THE SUBTROPICAL JET THURSDAY AND FRIDAY MAY 
HOWEVER RESULT IN CONTINUED SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS AS THERE WILL BE 
AMPLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY TO TAP INTO. 
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO INDICATE THE NEXT FRONT/TROUGH SYSTEM TO 
AFFECT THE KEYS BEGINNING AROUND FRIDAY NIGHT WITH BREEZY 
CONDITIONS...AND ADDITIONALLY HIGHER POPS HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND. 
UNCERTAINTY IS STILL QUITE HIGH SO WILL HOLD OFF ON RAISING POPS FOR 
THIS PERIOD.

&&

.MARINE...
LATEST GUIDANCE SUGGESTS NORTHEAST WINDS WILL HOLD ON IN THE 15 TO 
20 KNOT RANGE ACROSS KEYS WATERS THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 
WILL MAINTAIN SCEC FOR THE STRAITS. THEREAFTER...WINDS SHOULD COME 
DOWN ACROSS ALL KEYS WATERS TO 15 KNOTS OR LESS.

&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP LATER TONIGHT OVER THE WATER PORTION 
OF THE KMIA TO KEYW ROUTE AS SOUTHERLY FLOW SETS UP ON TOP OF THE 
COOL AND DRY AIRMASS BROUGHT IN BY YESTERDAYS FRONT.  THESE SHOWERS 
WILL PRODUCE BRIEF AND ISOLATED MVFR CONDITIONS.  AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...CURRENT CROSSWIND PROBLEMS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL EASE AS

EAST IN THE KEYS AREA LATE TONIGHT. 

.MARINE...
SE WINDS IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE ARE EXPECTED TO TURN S TO SW BETWEEN 
MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE...WHILE SPEEDS MAY INCREASE CLOSER TO 20 KT 
OVER GULF AND BAY WATERS. AT THE MINIMUM...STRONGER GUSTS ARE

.AVIATION...
THROUGH 5AM...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL OVER THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
AVIATION ROUTE AND ISLAND TERMINALS. TOWARDS DAYBREAK 
HOWEVER...SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO ENCROACH ON THE AVIATION ROUTE AS 
WINDS SHIFT TO THE SOUTHWEST IN ADVANCE OF A COLD FRONT PUSHING 
THROUGH THE GULF. SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL INCREASE AS THE MORNING 
PROGRESSES...WITH NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
IMPACTING THE ROUTE FROM MID MORNING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. MVFR 
CEILINGS WITH OCCASIONAL IFR CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THIS 
PERIOD. THE FRONT WILL PUSH EAST OF THE ROUTE AND INTO THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING. AFTER THE FRONT 
PUSHES THROUGH WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST AT NEAR 20 KNOTS 
AND BECOME GUSTY. SKIES WILL NOT CLEAR IMMEDIATELY AFTER FRONTAL

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
325 PM EDT FRI OCT 27 2006

.DISCUSSION...
A THIN LINE OF SHALLOW CU EXTENDING FROM THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
ADJACENT TO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS INTO THE GULF WATERS NORTHWEST 
OF KEY WEST HAS BEEN PERSISTENT SINCE THIS MORNING...ACCOMPANIED BY 
THE LIGHTEST OF PRECIPITATION ECHOES. OTHERWISE THE LOCAL AREA IS 
UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES...AND THE LARGER ECHOES EVIDENT ON KBYX 
RADAR THIS AFTERNOON ARE CHAFF. TEMPERATURES HAVE CLIMBED TO THE 
MIDDLE 80S ALONG THE ISLANDS. WINDS AT THE CMANS HAVE BEEN MODERATE 
THIS MORNING...BUT HAVE BECOME FRESH FROM THE SOUTHEAST OVER THE 
PAST FEW HOURS. ISLAND SENSORS ARE ALSO CLIMBING...REGISTERING 
BETWEEN 10 AND 15 MPH WITH GUSTS CLOSE TO 20 MPH ACROSS THE LOWER 
KEYS.

.FORECAST...
IN THE IMMEDIATE TERM...WIND SPEEDS HAVE BEEN TOUGH TO NAIL DOWN. 
BUT IT APPEARS THAT THE SHORT RANGE MODELS MAY BE SHORT-CHANGING THE 
EXPECTED SPEEDS THROUGH THIS EVENING. WILL HAVE BREEZY RIGHT OFF THE 
BAT ON THE UPCOMING ZONE FORECAST. FOR RAIN CHANCES...SATELLITE 
SHOWS DEVELOPING CLOUD COVER IN THE EAST CENTRAL GULF...WELL AHEAD 
OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT ON A CONVEYOR OF MOIST/UNSTABLE AIR. 
BREEZES ARE INCREASING IN THAT AREA AS WELL. SO THE LOCAL AREA WILL 
SEE A TRANSITION THROUGH LATE THIS EVENING AND THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD 
AS OUR STABLE LAYER ERODES...AND A MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS GLIDES 
IN ON A NICELY VEERED PROFILE. THE GRIDS WILL FEATURE A SMALL CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS THROUGH ABOUT MIDNIGHT AND THEN A RATHER RAPID UPGRADE TO 
LIKELY WITH THE ADDITION OF THUNDER AS THIS UNSTABLE AIRMASS 
INVADES. TIMING OF THE STRONGER STORMS REMAINS PROBLEMATIC...BUT IT 
APPEARS THAT FROM SUNRISE ON SATURDAY TO PERHAPS THE EARLY AFTERNOON 
HOURS WILL BE THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS/FEW THUNDERSTORMS...WITH 
BRIEF HEAVY DOWNPOURS NOT RULED OUT. THE GFS IS QUICKER THAN THE NAM 
TURNING THE BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS TO THE WEST/NORTHWEST ON SATURDAY 
(BY 18Z)...WHILE THE NAM IS STILL OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST AT THAT TIME. 
THIS SLIGHT TIMING DIFFERENCE COULD SPELL THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN 
LIGHTER RAINS BY EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON OR THE POSSIBILITY OF 
HEAVIER SHOWERS/TSTMS LINGERING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON 
AND EVEN INTO THE EARLY EVENING. A TOUGH CALL FOR ANY OUTDOOR 
ACTIVITIES ANYWHERE IN THE KEYS FOR SATURDAY. THAT SAID...I FEEL IT 
BEST TO HANG ON TO LIKELY SHOWERS AND A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS INTO 
THE EARLY AFTERNOON...AND THEN TAPER THE RAIN CHANCES BACK AS THE 
STEERING FLOW WILL EVENTUALLY TURN TO THE WEST/NORTHWEST. THE GRIDS 
WILL US A 19Z DELINEATION INTO JUST SHOWERS. AND THE BREEZY 
CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE FOR THE ENTIRE DAY. LOOKING THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...STILL ONLY SMALL CONFIDENCE ON HOW FAR 
SOUTHEAST OF THE KEYS THE DEEP MOISTURE GRADIENT WILL PUSH. SINCE 
YESTERDAY...THE MODELS DO NOT CLEAR THE KEYS VERY FAR OR FOR VERY 
LONG...AND KEEP ONLY A BRIEF PERIOD SUNDAY OF DRIER AIR SINKING 
THROUGH THE MID LEVELS ON A TRANSITIONAL WIND PROFILE. BUT BY SUNDAY 
NIGHT...A TROUGH ALOFT BEGINS TO RETROGRADE BACK TOWARDS THE KEYS 
AND PUTS THE LOCAL AREA UNDER A 2 PLUS AIRMASS. BUT THE 2.4 FIELD 
THAT WAS EVIDENT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK ON THE GFS IS MUCH 
LOWER ON THIS CYCLE. ANOTHER FRONT TRIES TO PUSH THROUGH SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND THE KEYS LATE NEXT WEEK. THIS LOOKS SUSPECT UNDER A 
PERSISTENT SOUTHWEST FLOW LOCALLY AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUBBLING 
QUICKLY OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES AND INTO THE ATLANTIC. THAT 
SAID...WILL KEEP A HIGHER THAN NORMAL RAIN CHANCE FOR MONDAY THROUGH 
THE DURATION OF NEXT WEEK WITH TEMPERATURES A COUPLE OF DEGREES 
ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGE.

.MARINE...
AS STATED ABOVE THE IMMEDIATE CONCERN IS THE WINDS. WILL HEADLINE 
EACH MARINE ZONE WITH AN EXERCISE CAUTION FOR SMALL CRAFT THANKS TO 
FRESHENING AND MORE SOUTHERLY BREEZES. BOATERS OUT TONIGHT SHOULD BE 
AWARE OF SHOWERS BECOMING LIKELY OVERNIGHT AND THE POSSIBILITY OF 
THUNDERSTORMS BEFORE SUNRISE ON SATURDAY. ALTHOUGH A SMALL CRAFT 
EXERCISE CAUTION WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH SATURDAY...SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS AND HEAVIER DOWNPOURS WILL BRING LOCALIZED WIND AND 
SEAS CONDITIONS UP BRIEFLY. AS THE WINDS TURN THROUGH THE NORTHWEST 
AND NORTH SATURDAY NIGHT...TO BECOME NORTHEAST ON SUNDAY...AN 
EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINE WILL MORE THAN LIKELY BE MAINTAINED. AT 
THIS TIME...A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IS NOT ANTICIPATED BUT A SMALL 
INCREASE IN ANTICIPATED WIND SPEEDS COULD PROMPT ONE ON LATER IN THE 
WEEKEND. KEEP ABREAST OF THE UPDATED FORECASTS FOR THE LATEST 
INFORMATION THIS WEEKEND.

.AVIATION...
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON...VFR WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE 
MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE. ONLY PATCHES OF VFR CEILINGS WILL BE 
ENCOUNTERED MAINLY OVER THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE...UNDER A 
STRONG INVERSION BASED AT AROUND 5KFT. THIS EVENING...CONDITIONS 
WILL RAPIDLY CHANGE AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE ROUTE. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMING CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE AND THE 
TEMPERATURE INVERSION DISAPPEARING...ALONG WITH WITH INCREASED LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE AND CONVERGENCE. BY TONIGHT...ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE 
EXPECTED WITHIN THE ROUTE. COVERAGE WILL INCREASE IN THE MORNING TO 
NUMEROUS...ACCOMPANIED BY MVFR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED IFR 
THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE FRONT. CONDITIONS SHOULD GRADUALLY 
IMPROVE LATE TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS THE FRONT FINALLY 
CLEARS THE KEYS. SURFACE WINDS WILL START OUT AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS OUT 
OF THE SOUTHEAST...TURNING STEADILY CLOCKWISE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS 
TO NORTHWEST BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

KBYX RADAR CONTINUES TO SHOW A THIN LINE OF LIGHT SHOWERS/SPRINKLES 
OUT IN THE STRAIT...WELL SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS AND IN THE WATERS 
SOUTH OF THE MARQUESAS KEYS. MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS A STRONG 
INVERSION NEAR 5 KFT WHICH SHOULD HOLD FOR THE REST OF 
TODAY...BEFORE ERODING LATER TONIGHT. AT THIS TIME...WILL NOT UPDATE 
THE ZONE FORECAST...BUT WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON A FEW SHALLOW 
ECHOES THAT MAY HOLD TOGETHER ENOUGH IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS WHICH 
MAY PROMPT A QUICK UPDATE LATER TO INCLUDE A LIGHT SHOWERS OR TWO. 
OTHERWISE...EXPECT TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 80S WITH SOUTHEAST 
WINDS CLOSE TO 15 MPH TODAY.

.MARINE...
BASED ON RECENT SHIP REPORT IN THE WATERS ROUGHLY 50 NM SOUTH OF KEY 
WEST...WITH A WIND SPEED OF 14 KNOTS AND SEAS OF 4 FEET...WILL LOWER 
THE EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINE IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS ON THE LATE

RIDGE SHOULD KEEP THE WIND SPEEDS CLOSE TO OR A LITTLE LESS THAN 
THEIR PRESENT READINGS FOR THE DURATION OF THE AFTERNOON. OTHERWISE 
NO CHANGES ANTICIPATED.

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI

GOES-12 IR IMAGERY SHOWS CONSIDERABLE STRATOCUMULUS COVERING THE 
FLORIDA KEYS AND THE SURROUNDING WATERS...BUT WITH LOCAL RADARS ONLY 
DETECTING A FEW SPRINKLES OVER THE OUTER STRAITS WELL SOUTH OF THE 
LOWER KEYS. SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES LOW PRESSURE (1004 MB) OVER 
EASTERN OKLAHOMA WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING INTO SOUTHEAST

MIGRATE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TODAY AND TONIGHT...BEFORE 
REACHING THE MID ATLANTIC COAST SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE 
SOUTHERN EXTENT HANGING BACK OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
BECAUSE OF THE PROGRESSIVE AND AMPLIFYING FLOW ALOFT...A LARGE MID 
AND UPPER ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND FLORIDA 
PENINSULA WILL RETREAT INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. 
MEANWHILE...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE TAKING SHAPE OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS EARLY THIS MORNING WILL INTENSIFY AND TRACK RAPIDLY THROUGH

SATURDAY MORNING. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL PULL AN ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO SATURDAY MORNING...BEFORE 
PASSING THROUGH OUR REGION SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND INTO THE STRAITS 
SATURDAY EVENING. 

TODAY...
GRADUAL MOISTENING WITHIN A SOUTHEAST FLOW WILL ALLOW PWAT VALUES TO 
REACH NEAR 1.5 INCHES BY THE END OF TODAY. HOWEVER...BELIEVE A 
WELL PRONOUNCED INVERSION WILL PRECLUDE ANY SIGNIFICANT 
PRECIPITATION AND THEREFORE POPS WILL BE REMOVED FOR THIS PERIOD.

TONIGHT...
WITH THE APPROACHING MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH...LOW AND MID LEVEL 
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL INCREASE WITH PWAT VALUES REACHING 
ABOVE 2.0 INCHES. DESPITE INSTABILITY NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE WITH 
FAIRLY BENIGN LAPSE RATES...ORGANIZED LOW AND MID LEVEL WIND 
PROFILES COMBINED WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT BETWEEN 300 AND 305 SURFACES 
WILL PROMPT POPS TO BE INCREASED TO THE LIKELY CATEGORY OVERNIGHT. 
IN FACT...WITH THE INCREASING LOW LEVEL SOUTHWEST STEERING FLOW 
BLOWING ACROSS GULF STREAM WATERS...A FEW STORMS MAY BE STRONG. 

SATURDAY...
GIVEN AMPLE MOISTURE IN PLACE WITH A DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW...THE LOW 
LEVEL CONFLUENCE BOUNDARY PUSHING ACROSS OUR REGION FROM LATE 
SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH MID AFTERNOON SHOULD GENERATE A WIDE SWATH 
OF SHOWERS AND EMBEDDED ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. SINCE THE MAIN MID 
AND UPPER LEVEL VORTICITY WILL LAG BEHIND THE LOW LEVEL FORCING 
BOUNDARY AND THE UPPER LEVEL REAR ENTRANCE OF THE JET ALOFT WILL 
REMAIN WELL TO OUR NORTH...NO SEVERE STORMS ARE EXPECTED. ALTHOUGH A 
FEW COULD BE STRONG WITHIN A MODERATE SOUTHWEST FLOW. OTHERWISE...IT 
APPEARS THE BULK OF THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DIMINISH 
FROM WEST TO EAST BEGINNING MID TO LATE AFTERNOON...WITH ONLY A FEW 
LEFTOVER SHOWERS POSSIBLE SATURDAY EVENING. BREEZY AND COOLER AIR 
WILL FOLLOW LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. 

(SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)
WITH THE SOUTHERN MID AND UPPER LEVEL STREAM REMAINING 
ACTIVE...ANOTHER MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL TAKE SHAPE OVER THE 
GULF OF MEXICO. HENCE...THE COLD FRONT SHOULD BECOME STATIONARY OVER 
THE STRAITS OR NORTH COAST OF CUBA SUNDAY...BEFORE POSSIBLY LIFTING 
BACK NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT NEXT WEEK. GIVEN PWAT VALUES OF 
AROUND 2 INCHES AND THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT...WILL MAINTAIN 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL POPS BEGINNING MONDAY.

.MARINE...
MODERATE SOUTHEAST WINDS TODAY WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE AND BECOME 
FRESH LATE TONIGHT...AND CONTINUE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. AN EXERCISE

AT 8 PM A 1023 MB HIGH CENTER WAS ON THE COAST AT THE NORTH & SOUND 
CAROLINAS BORDER. FROM THERE TO FLORIDA...PRESSURES ARE RUNNING 
ABOUT 2 MB ABOVE WHAT MODELS HAVE INDICATED FOR THIS TIME. WINDS 
OVER THE KEYS AREA HAVE COME UP A BIT...RUNNING SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN 
MODELS INDICATE FOR SURFACE WIND SPEEDS. ON THE REEF...C-MAN SITES 
HAVE BEEN REPORTING SUSTAINED 10 METER WINDS IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE 
WITH GUSTS 25 KT OR MORE. MERCHANT VESSEL EDYTH L OFF THE UPPER KEYS 
REPORTED WINDS EAST 19 KTS. AND...THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING 
MEASURED 1 & 2 THSD FT AGL WINDS FROM THE EAST AT 21 KT AND 23 KT, 
RESPECTIVELY. THE AIR IS STILL RELATIVELY DRY OVER THE REGION...
WITH KEYS SURFACE DEWPOINTS STILL IN THE LOWER 60S...AND 
PRECIPITABLE WATER AT 1.23 INCH BASED ON THE EVENING SOUNDING. AN 
INVERSION PERSISTS AT 5 THSD FT...TRAPPING STATOCU LAYERS AT AND 
JUST BELOW THAT LEVEL. NO PRECIPITATION IS DETECTED ON KEYS RADAR 
YET. IR SATELLITE AND SURFACE DATA SHOW THAT MOIST TROPICAL AIR IS 
MOVING NW FROM THE CARIBBEAN AND INTO THE SE GULF OF MEXICO AROUND 
THE YUCATAN CHANNEL.

325 PM EDT THU OCT 26 2006

.DISCUSSION...
A LONG AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS BECOMING CENTERED OVER THE CAROLINAS 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A SOUTHERN EXTENSION THROUGH SOUTHEAST GEORGIA 
AND THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. SATELLITE SHOWS SHALLOW STRATOCU MOSTLY 
OFF TO THE EAST/SOUTHEAST OF THE ISLANDS. THESE ARE BELOW A DEEP DRY 
LAYER. WINDS REMAIN MODERATE ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...OCCASIONALLY 
FRESH IN THE WATERS WEST OF THE KEY WEST THIS AFTERNOON. NO 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES ON NEARBY RADARS. NOTE: THERE IS MAINTENANCE 
BEING DONE ON KBYX AIR CONDITIONERS...AND THOSE PRODUCTS WILL BE 
INTERMITTENT AT BEST THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.

.FORECAST...
THE AIRMASS WILL CONTINUE TO MODIFY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS...AND BY LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING...THE PROFILE 
BECOMES MOIST THROUGH A DEEP VEERED LAYER. SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES 
ARISE BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS AS FAR AS THE COLD FRONT TIMING 
IN THE GULF ON SATURDAY...THE NAM BEING A BIT SLOWER...BUT THAT 
CAN BE EXPECTED UNDER A LAGGING AND POSITIVELY TILTED UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH. EITHER WAY...THE LOCAL AREA FALLS UNDER AN INCREASINGLY 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS BY LATE SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON...FOR THE BEST PERIOD OF SHOWERS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF 
THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER...THE BEST DYNAMICS REMAIN TO OUR NORTH AND 
THE AXIS OF MID LEVEL VORTICITY LAGS BEHIND THE BEST INSTABILITY. 
SO...BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MOS GUIDANCE ARE FLIRTING WITH LIKELY POPS 
FOR THE DAYTIME PERIOD OF SATURDAY. IF THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE 
UPPER LEVEL JET WERE POSITIONED FURTHER SOUTH ACROSS FLORIDA DURING 
THAT TIME...AND IF THE MID LEVEL ENERGY WASNT LAGGING...I WOULD GO 
LIKELY AS WELL. BUT AT THIS TIME I AM GOING TO LEAVE THE HIGH CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS IN THE GRIDS WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. OF COURSE THIS 
COULD CHANGE IF THE NEXT FEW MODEL RUNS CONSOLIDATE THE DYNAMICS 
FURTHER TO THE SOUTH AND EAST...SO KEEP ABREAST OF THE WEEKEND 
FORECAST ESPECIALLY IF YOU HAVE OUTDOOR PLANS IN THE KEYS ON 
SATURDAY.

BY SUNDAY...THE WEAKENING FRONT/TROUGH WILL BE ALONG OR SLIGHTLY TO 
THE SOUTHEAST OF THE KEYS. AND THERE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT PUSH 
BEYOND THAT...SO THE DEEP MOISTURE HANGS CLOSE BY. HOWEVER...THERE 
SHOULD BE A BRIEF INTRUSION OF DRIER AIR DROPPING THROUGH THE MID 
LEVELS...AND WILL CUT OUR RAIN CHANCES BACK TO A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. FLOW THEN TURNS BACK TO THE EAST THROUGH A 
DEEP LAYER MONDAY...ALLOWING THE TROUGH AND MOISTURE TO PUSH BACK 
ACROSS THE KEYS. THE GFS HAS AROUND 2 INCHES OF PWAT OVERHEAD BY 
EARLY TUESDAY MORNING...AND LINGERS A 2.3 TO OVER 2.4 PWAT AIRMASS 
RIGHT OVER THE KEYS FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. ALTHOUGH WE SHOULD 
REMAIN RATHER MOIST...THIS SEEMS OVERDONE...AND WILL KEEP A MIDDLE 
OF THE ROAD CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE LATE PERIODS OF THE 
FORECAST. WE WILL AGAIN HAVE TO SEE HOW LATER MODEL RUNS HANDLE THE 
MASS FIELDS IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA FOR THOSE TIMES. EXPECT SLIGHTLY 
WARMER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES AFTER THE TROUGH PASSES BACK ACROSS 
THE KEYS NEXT WEEK.

&&

.MARINE...
WINDS WILL SLOWLY TURN FROM EAST...THROUGH SOUTHEAST...SOUTH AND 
SOUTHWEST BY SATURDAY MORNING. THE EXACT TIMING OF NORTHWEST BREEZES 
IS STILL HARD TO PIN DOWN...BUT AT THIS TIME IT LOOKS LIKE LATE 
AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING ON SATURDAY. A CAUTIONARY HEADLINE FOR 
SMALL CRAFT IS PROBABLE FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT ACROSS MOST 
OF THE MARINE ZONES. AGAIN...THE BEST THUNDERSTORMS THREAT IS FOR 
THE DAYTIME HOURS OF SATURDAY...WHICH SHOULD BE CONSIDERED WHILE 
MAKING BOATING PLANS. OTHERWISE...NO OTHER HEADLINES ARE EXPECTED AT 
THROUGH TUESDAY.

EARLY MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS THE AIRMASS HAS MOISTENED THROUGH THE 
LOWEST LEVELS THANKS TO A DEEPENING NORTHEAST TO EASTER FLOW. BUT 
THIS LAYER IS STILL WELL CAPPED AND THE LOCAL ZONE FORECAST IS IN 
FINE SHAPE. NO MENTION OF RAIN. AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES SHOULD CLIMB

15 KNOTS THIS AFTERNOON. WILL DROP THE EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINE ON

==============================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
WITHIN THE DEEPENING EASTERLY FLOW...GOES-12 IR IMAGERY SHOWS 
CONSIDERABLE STRATOCUMULUS MOVING FROM THE ATLANTIC WATERS ACROSS A 
GOOD PORTION OF THE ISLAND CHAIN...BUT WITH LOCAL RADARS NOT 
DETECTING ANY SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION. ACROSS THE MARINE 
DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS 
OF 15 KNOTS WITH GUSTS OF AROUND 20 KNOTS.

.FORECAST(TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)
A PROGRESSIVE MID AND UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL AMPLIFY OVER THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS AS A VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE OVER THE 4 CORNER STATES 
TODAY...WILL TRACK QUICKLY EASTWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE 
FRIDAY. THIS MIGRATORY DISTURBANCE WILL DAMPEN SOMEWHAT WITH A 
POSITIVELY TILTED TROUGH AXIS LAGGING BEHIND IN THE CENTRAL GULF OF 
MEXICO LATE SATURDAY. WITH THE APPROACHING DEEP LAYERED TROUGH...A 
LARGE ANTICYCLONE OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES AND FLORIDA 
PENINSULA WILL SHIFT EASTWARD INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. GIVEN THIS 
SCENARIO...A MODERATE AND DEEPENING SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL APPRECIABLY 
INCREASE BOTH MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. 
BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES ALOFT...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE MID 
ATLANTIC COAST TODAY...WILL SHIFT INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TODAY 
AND TONIGHT. THEREAFTER...LOW PRESSURE WILL TAKE SHAPE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS TONIGHT...BEFORE TRACKING INTO THE MISSISSIPPI AND 
TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE FRIDAY. THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE 
INTO THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WHILE PULLING AN ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT THROUGH THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND INTO OUR REGION 
SATURDAY...BEFORE PUSHING INTO THE FLORIDA STRAITS SATURDAY NIGHT. 
PRECIPITATION WISE...GIVEN FORECAST SOUNDINGS DEPICTING PWAT VALUES

320 PM EDT WED OCT 25 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SHALLOW CU IS CONFINED TO THE ATLANTIC SIDE OF THE ISLANDS...WELL 
OUT OVER THE STRAITS THIS AFTERNOON...WITH LIMITED AND SHALLOW 
DEVELOPMENT ALSO INDICATED OVER THE MIAMI METRO AREA. WINDS OUT OF 
THE NORTHEAST ARE NOW MODERATE TO FRESH ACROSS THE ENTIRE SERVICE 
AREA AND KBYX RADAR IS VOID OF ANY PRECIPITATION ECHOES. 
TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE UPPER 70S ALONG THE ISLANDS THIS 
AFTERNOON.

.FORECAST...
THE HIGH PRESSURE THAT IS CENTERED NEAR THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS 
AFTERNOON WILL EXPAND SOUTHEASTWARD AND BE ALONG THE CAROLINA 
COASTLINE BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THE DRY AIRMASS THAT IS IN PLACE 
OVER THE LOCAL AREA AND SOUTH FLORIDA WILL BEGIN A SLOW MODERATION 
OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS AS THE FLOW BELOW 5 KFT SETS UP OUT OF THE 
EAST. PWATS SHOULD INCREASE OVER ONE INCH OVERNIGHT AND CONTINUE A 
SLOW INCREASE THROUGH ONE AND A QUARTER OF AN INCH ON THURSDAY. BUT 
SINCE THIS IS IN A SHALLOW AND DIFFLUENT LAYER UNDER A FLAT MID TO 
UPPER LEVEL REGIME...WILL LEAN VERY CLOSE TO BOTH THE GFS AND NAM 
MOS NUMBERS...WHICH ARE ALL BELOW 10 PERCENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH 
TOMORROW. WILL KEEP A DRY FORECAST FOR ALL PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE 
AREA TONIGHT...AND ONLY AN ISOLATED SHOWER WILL BE MENTIONED IN THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS ON THURSDAY. AS THE HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES OFF INTO 
THE ATLANTIC...THE STEERING FLOW CONTINUES TO TURN TOWARD THE 
SOUTHEAST. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE MENTIONED FOR ALL 
PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREA FROM THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. BY SATURDAY...A COLD FRONT WILL BE SLIDING ACROSS THE STATE 
OF FLORIDA...AND THE FLOW BECOMES DEEP OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST. THE GFS 
AND NAM ARE IN RELATIVELY GOOD AGREEMENT AS FAR AS THE TIMING OF THE 
FRONT IS CONCERNED...BUT THE GFS IS INDICATING A MUCH DEEPER 
MOISTURE PROFILE IN ASSOCIATION WITH SIGNIFICANT VERTICAL FORCING 
THROUGH THE DAY ON SATURDAY FOR THE IMMEDIATE AREA. MOS POP NUMBERS 
CONTINUE TO EDGE HIGHER FOR THE SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT PERIODS. 
AT THIS TIME...FEEL THAT THE LIKELY POPS FOR LATE SATURDAY ARE 
OVERDONE...AND WILL STAY WITH JUST A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. IF MODEL CONSISTENCY CONTINUES OVER THE NEXT FEW 
RUNS...THESE CHANCES MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED. AT ANY RATE...THE 
FRONT WHICH SLIDES THROUGH FLORIDA ON SATURDAY SHOULD WEAKEN AND 
STALL JUST TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE KEYS BY EARLY SUNDAY. HIGH 
PRESSURE SPILLS OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST AND RAPIDLY TURNS OUR FLOW 
BACK TO THE EAST BY MONDAY. SO THE FRONT WILL PROBABLY CROSS BACK 
OVER THE KEYS AND KEEP US IN A RELATIVELY MOIST AIRMASS. WILL KEEP 
RAIN CHANCES FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY JUST ABOVE CLIMO...AND THE 
SAME WITH THE TEMPERATURES FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.

&&

.MARINE...
WITH A MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH BREEZES TURNING TO THE EAST 
TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY...WILL REMOVE THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR 
SEAS OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS ON THE UPCOMING FORECAST ISSUANCE. 
SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION ON THE WATERS BEYOND THE REEF AS 
THE SEAS ARE SLOWLY DIMINISHING TONIGHT. SEAS WILL BE BELOW SMALL 
CRAFT CAUTIONARY CRITERIA BY EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. EXPECT A 
MODERATE EAST BREEZE ON THURSDAY...VEERED MORE TO THE SOUTHEAST ON 
FRIDAY. AGAIN...A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE KEYS ON SATURDAY AND 
SHOULD STALL AND WEAKEN JUST ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE OF THE ISLAND ON 
SUNDAY. THIS WEAKENED FRONT WILL PROBABLY PUSH BACK ACROSS THE KEYS 
DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. AT THIS TIME...NO ADVISORY CONDITIONS ARE 
EXPECTED...BUT A CAUTIONARY HEADLINE MAY BE NEEDED FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY ON THE OFFSHORE WATERS. KEEP ABREAST OF LATER FORECASTS FOR 
UPDATED INFORMATION CONCERNING SUNDAY AND MONDAY.

&&

NO ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR THANKS TO A DRY AIRMASS OVER THE REGION. 
WINDS ARE NORTHEAST NEAR 15 MPH...AND CMANS ARE STILL AVERAGING 
BETWEEN 15 AND 20 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 70S AT THIS 
TIME ALONG THE ISLANDS...AND SHOULD TOP OUT IN THE UPPER 70S. WRF 
GUIDANCE INDICATES THAT LOCAL WINDS WILL STAY UP THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
AFTERNOON. LITTLE CHANGE TO THE LATE MORNING COASTAL WATERS 
FORECAST...WILL MAINTAIN THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS 
IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. NO ZONE UPDATE IS 
NECESSARY. AVIATION CONCERNS...EXPECT A 10 TO 12 KNOT CROSS WIND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE AFTERNOON.

=================================================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN 
ARE CLEAR. WINDS OVER LAND ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST NEAR 15 MPH.  
C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHEAST AT 15 TO 20 KNOTS.  
TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 70 DEGREES. ONLY ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES OF 
WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO MODERATE NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS 
OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 80S.  

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES 
TODAY AND TONIGHT. PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES SHOULD REMAIN 
BELOW ONE INCH TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE LOCAL WEATHER WILL FEATURE 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND NO MEASURABLE RAINFALL TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE OVER THE CAROLINAS THURSDAY. THIS 
WILL ALLOW WINDS TO BECOME EAST AND ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE TO 
INCREASE. BY SUNSET THURSDAY...PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE JUST ABOVE ONE 
AND ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH. THIS INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE IS 
ENOUGH TO WARRANT DIME POPS FOR THURSDAY...ALTHOUGH MORE THAN LIKELY 
MOST ISLAND LOCATIONS SHOULD REMAIN FREE OF MEASURABLE RAINFALL 
THURSDAY. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE THURSDAY 
NIGHT AS THE AFOREMENTIONED AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC. BY SUNRISE FRIDAY...PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE NEAR ONE 
AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH. LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT SHOULD LIMIT POPS 
TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY THURSDAY NIGHT. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA FRIDAY. FARTHER NORTH...A 
COLD FRONT COULD BE MOVING THROUGH NORTH FLORIDA FRIDAY. 
SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW SHOULD DEEPEN AND THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD CONTINUE 
TO DESTABILIZE FRIDAY. BE THAT AS IT MAY...NO MORE THAN LOW CHANCE 
POPS ARE NEEDED FOR FRIDAY.    

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
FORECAST UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH IN THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE 
FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. A COLD FRONT COULD BE PASSING OVER 
CENTRAL FLORIDA FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT MAY APPROACH THE KEYS 
SATURDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL CONTINUES TO  
DEEPEN AND SLOW THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE ASSOCIATED 
WITH THIS COLD FRONT...SO THERE IS A POSSIBILITY THAT THE FRONT MAY 
NOT APPROACH THE KEYS UNTIL SUNDAY MORNING. EITHER WAY...THIS COLD 
FRONT SHOULD BE ACCOMPANIED BY DYNAMICS...OR LARGE SCALE LIFT...
AHEAD OF AND ALONG THE FRONT. THEREFORE...POPS WILL BE INCREASED BY 
10 PERCENT FOR SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. TIMING OF THE FRONT WILL BE 
THE MOST PROBLEMATIC PART OF THE WEEKEND FORECAST. THE FRONT MAY 
STALL JUST SOUTH OF THE KEYS SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THE FLOW MAY QUICKLY 
TURN BACK TO THE EAST AND PUSH THIS FRONT BACK ACROSS THE KEYS 
SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL INDICATES PWAT 
VALUES OF OVER TWO INCHES SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. THIS IS 
ENOUGH TO WARRANT LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. 

&&

.MARINE...
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS ARE IN EFFECT FOR ATLANTIC 
WATERS TODAY. SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION ON GULF WATERS AND 
ON FLORIDA BAY WATERS TODAY. WINDS WILL DECREASE BELOW SMALL CRAFT 
CAUTIONARY CRITERIA (15 TO 20 KNOTS) TONIGHT ON ALL KEYS WATERS. 
SEAS WILL DECREASE BELOW SMALL CRAFT CAUTIONARY CRITERIA (6 FEET) ON

.DISCUSSION...

.CURRENTLY...
WINDS HAVE DROPPED A BIT THIS EVENING...AND ARE NOW NORTHEASTERLY AT 
10 TO 15 MPH ON LAND...AND 15 TO 20 KNOTS ON THE WATER. TEMPERATURES 
ARE IN THE LOW 70S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 50S UNDER MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES. KBYX RADAR DETECTS PLENTY OF CHAFF...BUT NO 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN OR NEAR OUR AREA. KBYX 00Z RAOB SHOWS A PWAT 
OF 0.81 INCHES BEHIND LAST NIGHTS FRONT...WITH A SUBSTANTIAL 
INVERSION BASED AROUND 3500 FT AGL.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (OVERNIGHT)...
IT IS SOMEWHAT UNCLEAR WHETHER THE LOWER WINDS OF THE LAST SEVERAL 
HOURS ARE A RESULT OF A RELAXING OF THE SYNOPTIC GRADIENT...MAINLAND 
SHADOWING EFFECTS...FLOW DISRUPTION BY AFTERNOON HEATING OF THE 
MAINLAND...OR SOME MIXTURE OF THESE. ANY DISRUPTION FROM THE 
MAINLAND SHOULD HAVE CEASED BY NOW IF THAT WAS A PRIMARY CAUSE. 
ALSO...KBYX 00Z RAOB MEASURED 1000 FT AGL WINDS OF 16 KT AND 2000 FT 
AGL WINDS OF 18 KT...INDICATING THAT WEAKER FLOW IS NOT LIMITED TO 
THE NEAR-SURFACE LAYER. WINDS SHOW NO SIGNS OF RESTRENGTHENING 
TONIGHT...BUT MAY PICK UP JUST A BIT IN THE MORNING AS DAYTIME 
MIXING KICKS IN. IN LIGHT OF THIS...WILL UPDATE BOTH ZONE AND MARINE 
FORECAST PACKAGES TO REFLECT SLIGHTLY LOWER WINDS TONIGHT...BUT 
LEAVE WINDS AS INHERITED TOMORROW EXCEPT TO REMOVE MORNING GUSTS 
FROM THE ZONES. OTHERWISE...NO CHANGES TO THE FORECASTS ARE EXPECTED.

&&

.MARINE...
DUE TO THE FACT THAT WINDS HAVE DROPPED TO 15 TO 20 KT ON THE

325 PM EDT TUE OCT 24 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
JUST A FEW STREAKS OF CHAFF CURRENTLY ON KBYX RADAR...WITH A STEADY 
AND OCCASIONALLY STRONG N/NE BREEEZE SET UP. CMANS ARE AVERAGING 
JUST ABOVE 20 KNOTS WITH GUSTS CLOSE TO 28 KNOTS...THE ISLAND 
SENSORS ARE BETWEEN 15 AND 20 MPH AND GUSTY. TEMPERATURES TOOK A 
WHILE...BUT HAVE REACHED INTO THE MIDDLE 70S. BESIDES A SHALLOW CU 
FIELD EXPANDING SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE STRAITS...NOT A CLOUD TO BE 
FOUND OVER THE SERVICE AREA.

.FORECAST...
THE COLD FRONT THAT PUSHED THROUGH LAST NIGHT IS NOW STRETCHED FROM 
THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS..ACROSS CENTRAL CUBA...AND INTO THE WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN. THE LARGE HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE WILL CONTINUE TO 
EXPAND FROM THE MIDDLE MS VALLEY TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST COAST AND 
SHOULD BE CENTERED NEAR THE CAROLINA COAST LATE THURSDAY EVENING. AS 
A RESULT...WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS WILL HAVE A 
GRADUAL VEERING TREND THROUGH THAT TIME. THEY WILL ALSO MODERATE 
BEGINNING TONIGHT...BUT I BELIEVE THAT BOTH THE NAM AND GFS ARE TOO 
OPTIMISTIC AS FAR AS WIND SPEEDS ARE CONCERNED GIVEN THE HIGH 
DENSITY AIR MOVING OVER RELATIVELY WARM WATERS SURROUNDING THE KEYS. 
THERE SHOULD BE A SUSTAINED PERIOD OF MIXING...AND WILL HOLD ON 
TO AT LEAST BREEZY ALL LOCATIONS...AND MAYBE WINDY THROUGH A STRETCH 
OF THE ISLANDS TONIGHT. RAIN CHANCES ARE ABOUT NIL THROUGH THE NEXT 
36 HOURS AS IT WILL TAKE TIME FOR THE AIRMASS TO MODIFY. BY 
THURSDAY...THERE IS ENOUGH MOISTURE IN A LOW AND SHALLOW LAYER 
(BELOW H8) CARRIED IN ON AN EASTERLY FLOW TO KEEP A MINIMAL MENTION 
OF LIGHT SHOWERS. THE LATEST GFS RUN HAS CONTINUED TO DEEPEN AND 
SLOW THE UPPER TROUGH DRAGGING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO EARLY 
SATURDAY. AS A RESULT...THE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE AXIS ACROSS THE 
IMMEDIATE AREA HOLDS A LITTLE LONGER...AND THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED 
THROUGH SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS EARLY SATURDAY ON PREVIOUS 
RUNS...IS NOW SLATED TO MOVE THROUGH VERY LATE SATURDAY OR 
POSSIBLY SUNDAY MORNING. HAVE THEREFORE ADJUSTED HIGHER POPS FURTHER 
OFF IN TIME THANKS TO A PROLONGED SOUTHWESTERLY FETCH OF MOISTER 
AIR...NAMELY FROM LATE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...AND ADJUSTED 
THE MENTION OF THUNDER TO COINCIDE WITH A DELAYED AXIS OF 
INSTABILITY ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE WEEKEND FRONT. IN THE SHORTER 
TERM...BESIDES THE WINDS MENTIONED ABOVE...TEMPERATURES REMAIN THE 
CONCERN. A RELATIVELY COOL NIGHT TONIGHT BY KEYS STANDARDS...WILL 
CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE TEMPERATURES ABOUT 7 DEGREES BELOW THE NORMAL 
AT ALL LOCATIONS. HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY SHOULD BE ABOUT 4 DEGREES 
HIGHER THAN TODAY AND THEN HIGHS FOR THURSDAY SHOULD BE BACK NEAR 
THE NORM OF MID 80S. EXPECT LOWER TO MID 70S WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

LOOKING AHEAD TO THE LATE PERIODS OF THE FORECAST...EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
IF THE GFS IS CORRECT...WHICH IT HAS BEEN OVER THE LAST WEEK OR SO 
LOCALLY FOR ITS LONG RANGE FIELDS...THE FLOW QUICKLY TURNS BACK TO 
THE EAST AND KEEPS ENOUGH MOISTURE NEARBY TO MAINTAIN A MENTION OF 
SHOWERS. AT THIS POINT...HAVE NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO DEVIATE FROM 
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR CLIMO THEN AS 
WELL.

&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL BE MAINTAINED ON ALL WATERS THANKS TO 
THE EXPECTED MIXING MENTIONED ABOVE. A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL 
LIKELY BE MAINTAINED FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS ON 
WEDNESDAY...WITH AN EXERCISE CAUTION ON THE GULF WATERS EARLY. 
CONDITIONS SHOULD BE BELOW ANY HEADLINE CRITERIA LATE WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT NIGHT. A COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO CROSS FLORIDA ON 
SATURDAY...AND THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS BY SUNDAY MORNING.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY WST...AND 
AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. STRONG NORTH-NORTHEAST WINDS WILL PRODUCE  
CROSSWINDS TO 20KTS ON OUR EAST-WEST RUNWAYS AT KEY WEST AND 
MARATHON. AFTER 06Z (2AM LDT) THESE WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE.

&&

.PRELIMINARY TEMPS AND POPS...

.DISCUSSION...
A COOL AND WINDY START TO THE MORNING ALONG THE ISLANDS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE STILL IN THE 60S AT ALL LAND SENSORS AT THIS HOUR 
WITH A STRONG NORTH WIND IN PLACE. THE ONLY ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR ARE 
WELL SOUTH OF THE SERVICE AREA...OVER NORTH CENTRAL CUBA...IN THE 
VICINITY OF THE COLD FRONT THAT PUSHED THROUGH LAST NIGHT. A DRY 
AIRMASS IS IN PLACE...WITH EVEN MUCH DRIER AIR UPSTREAM. THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST IS IN GOOD SHAPE. WITH COOLER AIR CONTINUING TO 
ADVECT IN...TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY CLIMB A COUPLE OF DEGREES...TO 
TOP OUT IN THE MID 70S. NO ZONE UPDATE IS PLANNED. A RECENT SHIP 
REPORT SOUTH OF KEY WEST SHOWS THE COASTAL WATERS FORECAST IS ON 
TRACK. NO CHANGES WILL BE INCLUDED IN THE LATE MORNING MARINE 
UPDATE. OF COURSE A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY REMAINS IN ALL WATERS. FOR 
THE AVIATION CONCERNS...EXPECT 15 TO 20 KNOT CROSSWINDS AT BOTH KEYW 
AND KMTH INTO TONIGHT.

=================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE 
AREA FROM OCEAN REEF TO KEY WEST. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE VARIABLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE 
NORTH NEAR 20 MPH...WITH GUSTS NEAR 25 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON 
AVERAGE...ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT 20 TO 25 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 
30 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 70S. NO WARMING IS EXPECTED 
TODAY DUE TO STRONG LOW LEVEL COLD AIR ADVECTION.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A COLD FRONT IS LOCATED OVER THE OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE KEYS. 
THIS FRONT SHOULD MOVE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. A 
LARGE AND STRONG AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES SHOULD BE BELOW ONE INCH TODAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE LOCAL WEATHER WILL FEATURE BELOW NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES...ABOVE NORMAL WINDS...AND NO MEASURABLE RAINFALL TODAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE AFOREMENTIONED AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD 
MOVE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. AN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA 
THURSDAY. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL INCREASE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY. BE THAT AS IT MAY...PWAT VALUES SHOULD REMAIN BELOW ONE 
AND ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER SHOULD 
PERSIST FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BY SUNSET THURSDAY...
PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE NEAR ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH. THIS 
INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE IS ENOUGH TO WARRANT DIME POPS FOR 
THURSDAY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA THURSDAY NIGHT. PWAT VALUES MAY RISE ABOVE TWO INCHES 
THURSDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...POPS WILL BE INCREASED BY 10 PERCENT 
FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER COLD FRONT MAY APPROACH SOUTH FLORIDA 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...BEFORE CROSSING THE KEYS FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT 
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HAVE MORE IN THE WAY OF DYNAMICS...OR LARGE SCALE 
LIFT...AHEAD OF AND ALONG THE FRONT. THEREFORE...POPS WILL BE 
INCREASED BY 10 PERCENT FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT 
SHOULD BE LOCATED SOUTH OF THE KEYS BY EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR SATURDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND 
THE FRONT SHOULD SWIFTLY MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES 
SATURDAY NIGHT...AND INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC SUNDAY. IF THIS IS 
THE CASE...RETURN EASTERLY FLOW WILL SET UP OVER THE KEYS SUNDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY. AS A RESULT...POPS WILL BE INCREASED BY 10 PERCENT 
FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY.

.MARINE...
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES ARE IN EFFECT FOR ALL KEYS WATERS TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS WILL BE REQUIRED 
FOR ATLANTIC WATERS WEDNESDAY. SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION 
ON GULF WATERS AND FLORIDA BAY WATERS WEDNESDAY. WINDS WILL DECREASE 
BELOW SMALL CRAFT CAUTIONARY CRITERIA (15 TO 20 KNOTS) WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT ON ALL KEYS WATERS. SEAS WILL DECREASE BELOW SMALL CRAFT 
CAUTIONARY CRITERIA (6 FEET) ON ATLANTIC WATERS THURSDAY. ANOTHER 
COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO CROSS SOUTH FLORIDA BY EARLY SATURDAY.

1030 PM EDT MON OCT 23 2006

...FIRST SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT OF THE SEASON...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO PUSH SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE KEYS 
FORECAST AREA. THE FRONT PASSED THROUGH THE TORTUGAS LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH NORTH WINDS SUSTAINED AROUND 20 TO 25 KNOTS. THIS 
FRONT IS NOW JUST NORTHWEST OF KEY WEST. BECAUSE THE FRONT IS ON OUR 
DOOR STEP...THERE IS QUITE A WIND SPEED GRADIENT ACROSS THE 
KEYS...WITH WINDS NEAR 15 KNOTS AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL 
AIRPORT...AND 5 KNOTS OR LESS AT MOLASSES AND LONG KEY. TEMPERATURES 
ACROSS THE KEYS ARE AROUND 80 DEGREES WITH DEW POINTS NEAR 70. THIS 
EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED SOME LOCAL INHIBITION AND A PWAT OF 1.85 
INCHES. HOWEVER...LATEST GPS READINGS INDICATE PWAT HAS SINCE 
DECREASED DRAMATICALLY TO AROUND 1.6 INCHES. THE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT AFFECTED PORTIONS OF THE UPPER KEYS THIS EVENING 
HAS DISSIPATED...AND CURRENTLY THE ONLY SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST AREA 
IS OVER THE STRAITS.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (OVERNIGHT)...
THE COLD FRONT WILL PROGRESS THROUGH THE LOWER KEYS BEFORE 
MIDNIGHT...AND THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE ISLAND CHAIN BY AN HOUR 
OR TWO AFTER MIDNIGHT. LITTLE TO NO SHOWER ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED WITH 
THIS FRONT. ONCE THE FRONT PASSES THROUGH WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
INCREASE TO NEAR 20 MPH AND GUSTY. MODERATE COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL 
DRIVE TEMPS AND DEW POINTS DOWN TO NEAR 70 AND 60 DEGREES 
RESPECTIVELY. A COOL MORNING IS IN STORE FOR MOST KEYS RESIDENTS. 
THE CURRENT FORECAST IS ON TRACK. MAY UPDATE THE LOCAL FORECAST TO 
REMOVE OR ADJUST TRANSITIONAL WORDING AT THE APPROPRIATE TIME.

&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR INCREASING WINDS AND 
SEAS ON ALL KEYS WATERS. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS ARE ALREADY 
IN PLACE ACROSS MUCH OF OUR GULF WATERS AND MUCH OF ZONE 75. THROUGH 
THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD...SMALL CRAFT CONDITIONS WILL EXTEND ACROSS ALL 
KEYS WATERS AS A COLD FRONT PUSHES THROUGH KEYS WATERS. ONGOING 
MARINE FORECAST IS ON TRACK. WILL ONLY ADJUST TRANSITIONAL WORDING 
FOR THE EVENING UPDATE.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH 12Z ALONG EYW-MIA AIRWAYS AND AT 
EYW AND MTH. INCREASING NORTH WINDS WILL AVERAGE FROM 340-020... 
STARTING OUT 10-12KT...BUT INCREASING TO 15-20KT WITH GUSTS 22-26KT 
BY 12Z. THIS WILL PRODUCE A 15-20KT CROSSWIND AT BOTH EYW AND MTH.

...FIRST SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT SINCE SPRING TO AFFECT THE KEYS 
TONIGHT...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX RADAR HAD SHOWN A THIN AREA OF SHOWERS...WITH OCCASIONAL 
EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE WATERS 40 NM SOUTH OF A LINE FROM DRY 
TORTUGAS TO THE LOWER KEYS EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. ANOTHER AREA HAS 
STRENGTHENED IN THE OFFSHORE WATERS ADJACENT TO THE UPPER KEYS. 
LITTLE OVERALL MOVEMENT HAS BEEN NOTED WITH ANY OIF THESE ATLANTIC 
STORMS. ADDITIONAL WEAK SHOWERS ARE APPROACHING THE NORTHWESTERN 
MARINE ZONES...BEYOND 60 NM OFF OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY. 
OTHERWISE...WE HAVE SEEN BREAKS IN THE THICKER CLOUD SHIELD OVER 
MUCH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN OVER THE PAST 2 HOURS...AND TEMPERATURES 
HAVE REACHED INTO THE MIDDLE 80S. WINDS ARE OUT OF THE NORTH AND 
GENTLE ACROSS THE ISLANDS...AND AREA EDGING SLOWLY UPWARD ACROSS THE 
WESTERN MARINE ZONES AT THIS TIME.

.FORECAST...
THE COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO MAKE STEADY SOUTHWARD PROGRESS ACROSS 
FLORIDA THIS AFTERNOON...AND IS CURRENTLY CLOSE TO A PORT CHARLOTTE 
TO VERO BEACH LINE. ALTHOUGH A FEW DISCERNIBLE WAVES WILL BE PUSHING 
ACROSS THE LOCAL AREA AT MID LEVELS THIS EVENING AND EARLY 
TUESDAY...THE MOISTURE AXIS IN ASSOCIATION TO THE ACTUAL FRONTAL 
PASSAGE IS SHEARING ACROSS THE PENINSULA. THE GFS HAS BEEN 
CONSISTENT WITH THE FRONT SINCE EARLY LAST WEEK. WIND SPEEDS WILL 
INCREASE NICELY FROM LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD 
AND FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA. AND WE WILL FEEL THE 
ONSET OF MUCH DRIER AIR FUNNELING INTO THE AREA AT OR AN HOUR OR SO 
BEFORE MIDNIGHT. THIS EVENING WILL SEE A DIMINISIHING CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS OUT IN THE STRAITS...AND THEN JUST A SMALL MENTION OF 
SHOWERS FOR THE ENTIRE SERVICE AREA BEFORE THE DRIER AIR IS FELT. 
THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT AMONG THE MODELS CONCERNING THE DURATION OF 
HIGHER WIND SPEEDS. WE CAN EXPECT WINDY AND COOLER CONDITIONS ON 
TUESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED IN THE MIDDLE 70S ONLY. A GRADUAL 
VEERING OF WINDS WILL OCCUR FROM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH LATE IN THE 
WEEK. IT WILL REMAIN WINDY TUESDAY NIGHT...AND BREEZY ON WEDNESDAY 
WITH NO MENTION OF RAIN FOR THOSE PERIODS. A FRESH EAST BREEZE IS 
EXPECTED THURSDAY AS THE HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES OFF THE SOUTHEAST 
COAST...WITH A RETURN OF A SMALL CHANCE OF SHOWERS.
ANOTHER FRONT IS EXPECTED IN NORTH FLORIDA FRIDAY AND IS EXPECTED TO 
CROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS BY EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. BELIEVE 
THE GFS EXTENDED MOS GUIDANCE IS OVERDONE...ITS LIFT AND DEPTH OF 
MOISTURE SEEM EXCESSIVE. BUT I WILL ADD 10 PERCENT TO OUR POPS FOR 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO 
GIVE A MENTION TO THUNDER DURING THE DAY FRIDAY. YET ANOTHER FRONT 
WILL PUSH THROUGH THE LOCAL AREA EARLY MONDAY...BUT THIS SHOULD 
REINFORCE COOLER AIR MORESO THAN A TRIGGER FOR ANY RAIN.

&&

.MARINE...
WILL GO AHEAD AND RAISE THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY HEADLINE FOR ALL 
MARINE ZONES ON THIS AFTERNOON ISSUANCE. BOATERS CAN EXPECT THAT 
THROUGH TUESDAY AND MORE THAN LIKELY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGHER 
SEAS WILL LINGER OUT IN THE STRAITS THROUGH WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT ON A FRESH EASTERLY BREEZE. EXPECT AN EXERCISE CAUTION 
HEADLINE FOR MUCH OF THE MARINE AREA. BOATERS SHOULD KEEP ABREAST OF 
LATER FORECAST FOR MORE REFINED CONDITIONS. MORE AGREEABLE BOATING 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED LATE THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AS WE PICK UP A 
LIGHTER SOUTHERLY COMPONENT TO THE WINDS...AHEAD OF THE EARLY 
WEEKEND COLD FRONT.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THIS EVENING ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO 
KEY WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. AROUND 00Z A COLD FRONT WILL 
BE APPROACHING OUR VICINITY. THIS FEATURE WILL BRING THE THREAT OF 
TURBULENT CONDITIONS AS NORTH WINDS INCREASE TO 25 KNOTS. THIS WILL 
BE A CROSSWIND RELATIVE TO THE EAST-WEST RUNWAYS AT OUR ISLAND 
TERMINALS...PLEASE USE EXTRA CAUTION.

TONIGHT...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A COUPLE OF LINES OF SHOWERS...WITH A FEW EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS... 
HAVE DRIFTING WEST/NORTHWESTWARD OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. ONE LINE 
IS STILL LINGERING NEAR KEY WEST...WITH SMALLER SHOWERS WANING ON 
THE ATLANTIC SIDE OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS. ANOTHER STRONGER 
LINE STRETCHES FROM ABOUT 40 NM OFF OF THE MIDDLE KEYS TO THE WATERS 
WELL SOUTH OF A DRY TORTUGAS TO MARQUESAS KEYS LINE. RADAR IS 
SHOWING TOPS OF 40-45 KFT WITHIN THE WESTERN EXTENT OF THIS LINE. 
OTHERWISE...WINDS HAVE BACKED AT ALL REPORTING SITES...AND ARE 
CURRENTLY JUST EAST OF NORTH. CMANS ARE NEAR 10 KNOTS ON 
AVERAGE...ALTHOUGH THE SENSORS IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE SERVICE 
AREA HAVE BEEN DISTURBED BY THE CONVECTION OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF 
HOURS. ISLAND SENSORS ARE LESS THAN 10 MPH. THE STORMS THIS MORNING 
HAVE LEFT THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN REACHES OF THE SERVICE AREA UNDER 
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

.FORECAST...
THE KEYS REMAINS ON THE NORTHERN CUSP OF HIGHER MOISTURE. GOES 
SOUNDER INDICATES MUCH DRIER AIR NOT VERY FAR TO OUR NORTH...AS SEEN 
BY KMFL AND KTBW SOUNDINGS. LOCALLY...THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS SHOULD STAY UNDER AND AIRMASS THAT IS AT 2.0 PWAT OR HIGHER 
AND UNSTABLE. AN UPPER WAVE WILL BE MOVING AWAY FROM THE IMMEDIATE 
AREA...SO CONVECTIVE COVERAGE SHOULD DECREASE FROM THIS POINT 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON. WILL DECREASE THE RAIN 
CHANCE/COVERAGE OVER ALL OF THE SERVICE AREA FOR THE REST OF 
TODAY...BUT WILL INSERT THE SMALLEST CHANCE FOR THUNDER...ESPECIALLY 
ALONG AND TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE ISLAND CHAIN.

&&

.MARINE...
THE EARLY MORNING FORECAST IS ON TRACK. THE ONLY ADJUSTMENTS TO THE 
LATE MORNING MARINE FORECAST WILL BE TO BACK THE WINDS MORE TOWARDS 
THE NORTH INITIALLY...AND INSERT THE MENTION OF ISOLATED THUNDER ON 
THE ATLANTIC SIDE OF THE ISLANDS. WINDS AND SEAS WILL BEGIN TO 
INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON...AND A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL BE 
REQUIRED FOR ALL WATERS SURROUNDING THE KEYS TONIGHT.

&&

.AVIATION...
SHOWERS IN THE VICINITY OF THE KEY WEST TERMINAL WILL PRODUCE MVFR 
CIGS/VSBYS THROUGH ABOUT 15Z. OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS WILL 
PREVAIL ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY WEST UNTIL AROUND 18Z. AT THAT 
TIME ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS MAY TAKE PLACE AS A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES. THE FRONT WILL CREATE TURBULENT CONDITIONS AS NORTH 
WINDS INCREASE TO 25 KNOTS. THIS WILL BE A CROSSWIND RELATIVE TO THE 
EAST-WEST RUNWAYS AT OUR ISLAND TERMINALS...PLEASE USE EXTRA CAUTION.

WINDS OVER LAND ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN 
WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. ONLY ABOUT SIX DEGREES OF WARMING 
IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO INCREASING NORTH SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER 
WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE NEARSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE KEYS 
PROMPTED AN INCREASE IN POPS OF 10 PERCENT FOR TODAY. A COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE THROUGH SOUTH FLORIDA LATE TODAY...BEFORE CROSSING THE 
KEYS EARLY TONIGHT. A MUCH DRIER AIR MASS WILL MOVE OVER THE KEYS IN 
THE WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT. BY SUNRISE TUESDAY...
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES WILL HAVE FALLEN TO NEAR ONE INCH. 
DUE TO THE INVASION OF THIS DRY AIR MASS...POPS WERE REMOVED FROM 
THE TUESDAY FORECAST. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. BEHIND THE 
COLD FRONT...LATE TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...RESIDENTS OF THE KEYS 
SHOULD EXPECT BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES...ABOVE NORMAL WINDS...AND 
NO MEASURABLE RAINFALL.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES WILL MOVE INTO THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC WEDNESDAY NIGHT. PWAT VALUES SHOULD REMAIN BELOW 
ONE AND ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...POPS 
WERE REMOVED FROM THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT FORECAST. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA THURSDAY. 
ANOTHER COLD FRONT MAY MOVE OVER NORTH FLORIDA THURSDAY NIGHT. THE 
GFS NUMERICAL MODEL HAS BEEN VERY INCONSISTENT FROM RUN-TO-RUN 
REGARDING TIMING AND INTENSITY OF THIS COLD FRONT. THE FRIDAY

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
A DEPARTING ATLANTIC RIDGE IS JUST REACHING OVER FLORIDA...AS A COLD 
FRONT PUSHES SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO AND FLORIDA. 
SURFACE WINDS HAVE BEEN RUNNING MAINLY EAST AT AROUND 5 TO 10 MPH. 
THERE HAS BEEN SOME VARIABILITY OVER THE EVENING. A SMALL SCALE 
TROUGH MOVING WESTWARD OVER CUBA HAS CONTRIBUTED TO SCATTERED 
SHOWERS WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE EXTREME OUTER STRAITS.

&&

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (OVERNIGHT)...
THE COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ITS WAY ACROSS THE GULF AND 
FLORIDA OVERNIGHT AND THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL SHIFT FURTHER 
EASTWARD. WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BACK TO NORTHEAST TO NORTH BY 
MORNING...AND REMAIN IN THE 5 TO 10 MPH RANGE. THE ENVIRONMENT 
REMAINS CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE...AND MORE UNSTABLE THAN WE HAVE BEEN 
IN A NUMBER OF DAYS. IN ADDITION...PWAT VALUES HAVE INCREASED TO 
AROUND 1.8 INCHES. A FEW SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE DURING THE FAVORED 
EARLY MORNING PERIOD ALONG RESIDUAL BOUNDARIES. THE ACTIVITY OVER 
THE OUTER STRAITS IS NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE KEYS. THE ONGOING 
FORECAST IS ON TRACK...AND NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE. 
&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT TO GENTLE BREEZES WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT ACROSS KEYS WATERS. 
WINDS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO INCREASE MONDAY NIGHT TO 20 TO 25 KNOTS. 
SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES WILL LIKELY BE REQUIRED MONDAY NIGHT FOR 
INCREASING WINDS AND SEAS. IF YOU ARE PLANNING A PASSAGE THIS WEEK 
YOU SHOULD CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY. THOSE IN PORT SHOULD INSPECT THEIR 
GROUND TACKLE AND FENDERS.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE MOSTLY SUNNY OVER THE ISLANDS THIS AFTERNOON WITH HIGH 
TEMPERATURES WITHIN A COUPLE OF DEGREES OF THE DAILY RECORDS. WINDS 
WERE FROM THE EAST OR SOUTHEAST 5 TO 10 MPH ON LAND...NEAR 10 KTS AT 
THE CMAN STATIONS. SATELLITE SHOWED SCATTERED CLOUDS IN LINES IN THE 
STRAITS...AND OUR RADAR WAS PICKING UP SOME RETURNS OUT THERE. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
RIDGING IS DECREASING IN SOUTH FLORIDA. PRESSURES ARE FALLING AS A 
SURFACE FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH AND A WAVE-LIKE DISTURBANCE 
ENTERS THE EASTERN STRAITS. THIS IS CAUSING WIND SPEEDS TO DROP. 
MOISTURE IS SLOW TO INCREASE OFF SURFACE -- OUR ISLAND CLOUD-LINES 
ARE STRUGGLING UNLIKE THE LAST TWO DAYS.
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE FRONT TO OUR NORTH IS THE MAIN WEATHER STORY. BY TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON OUR WINDS WILL GO INTO THE NORTH AND BY EVENING SHOULD BE 
INCREASING. WE HAVE A CHANCE OF MEASURABLE RAIN BUT ONLY A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT RAIN...SO IT IS ANOTHER CASE WHERE THE WIND IS 
THE WEATHER. EXPECT FALLING TEMPERATURES AND FALLING DEW POINTS 
THROUGH MID-WEEK. 

LATER IN THE WEEK OUR WINDS WILL CLOCK AROUND INTO THE SOUTH 
AGAIN...AHEAD OF ANOTHER SURFACE COLD FRONT WHICH SHOULD BE NEARBY 
ON SATURDAY ACCORDING TO OUR LONGER-RANGE GUIDANCE. WE WILL HAVE TO 
WAIT A WHILE BEFORE WE CAN FILL IN DETAILS ON THIS UPCOMING 
EVENT...BUT THERE WILL BE A PUSH-PULL IN OUR TEMPERATURES IN 
RESPONSE TO THE SHIFTING WINDS.
&&

.MARINE...
RECREATIONAL BOATERS SHOULD HAVE ANOTHER 24 HOURS OF BENIGN 
CONDITIONS. BY MONDAY EVENING WE WILL BE LOOKING AT NORTH WINDS 
INCREASING TO 20-25 KNOTS ESPECIALLY ON THE GULF SIDE AND IN THE 
WESTERN STRAITS WHERE LONG-PERIOD SWELL WILL FIRST ARRIVE. WE WILL 
BE PUTTING UP THE SMALL CRAFT FLAG AS SOON AS WE CAN DO SO WITH 
CONFIDENCE AS TO TIMING. IF YOU ARE PLANNING A PASSAGE THIS WEEK YOU 
SHOULD CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY. THOSE IN PORT SHOULD INSPECT THEIR 
GROUND TACKLE AND FENDERS.   
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREDOMINATE ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE AND

SKIES WERE PARTLY CLOUDY OVER THE ISLANDS THIS MORNING WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S. WINDS WERE FROM THE EAST 
SOUTHEAST AROUND 10 MPH ON LAND...10G15 KTS AT THE CMAN STATIONS. 
SATELLITE SHOWED SCATTERED CLOUDS IN THE STRAITS...AND OUR RADAR WAS 
PICKING UP SOME RETURNS OUT THERE. A COUPLE OF CRUISE SHIPS WERE 
REPORTING UNUSUAL WEATHER CONDITIONS OFF THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA -- 
FLURRIES AND DUST STORMS. 

THE MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS AN INCREASE IN TOTAL COLUMN MOISTURE TO 
1.6. INHIBITION HAS DECREASED AND EASTERLIES CONTINUE THROUGH GREAT 
DEPTH. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
RIDGING HAS DECREASED IN SOUTH FLORIDA. THIS APPEARS TO BE IN 
RESPONSE TO A WAVE-LIKE DISTURBANCE ENTERING THE EASTERN 
STRAITS...AND GOES ALONG WITH THE INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND DECREASE 
IN STATIC STABILITY. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
AS THE WAVE APPROACHES OUR CONDITIONS WILL BECOME MORE FAVORABLE 
THROUGH THE DAY...AND BY AFTERNOON THERE SHOULD BE MORE ECHOES IN 
THE STRAITS AND AN ACTIVE CLOUD LINE OVER THE LOWER KEYS. THE GOING 
FORECASTS HAVE THIS COVERED AND NO UPDATES ARE PLANNED.
&&

.MARINE...
WE HAVE NOT YET SEEN DECREASING WINDS IN THE STRAITS. AS SHOWN ABOVE 
SPEEDS ARE STILL 10-15 KNOTS. THEREFORE WE MAY RETAIN TRANSITIONAL 
WORDING IN OUR UPCOMING ROUTINE ISSUANCE OF THE COASTAL ZONES. THE 
NEXT SET OF OBSERVATIONS WILL BE IMPORTANT. IN EITHER 
CASE...RECREATIONAL BOATERS SHOULD ENCOUNTER BENIGN CONDITIONS 
EXCEPT FOR THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND WATERSPOUTS IN THE VICINITY OF 
THE LOWER KEYS.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
430 AM EDT SUN OCT 22 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE AXIS HAS SHIFTED FARTHER NORTH 
OVERNIGHT...TO SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA...WHICH AIDED LOCAL EAST WINDS 
TO PICK UP TO NEAR 15 KT WITH GUSTS NEAR 20 KT. THIS IS JUST 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER THAN EARLIER MODEL OUTPUT HAD INDICATED. 
MEANWHILE...WATER VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW 
DRY AIR ALOFT OVER THE KEYS (APPROX. 1.4 INCH OF PRECIPITABLE 
WATER). HOWEVER...DEEPER MOISTURE IS NOT FAR AWAY...WITH INDICATIONS 
OF AN INCREASINGLY WETTER AIRMASS FROM THE EXTREME SE EDGE OF THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS...EXTENDING OVER THE CAY SAL BANK TO EASTERN CUBA 
AND THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. A FEW SHOWERS EVEN MANAGED TO MIGRATE INTO 
THE STRAITS BEFORE DISSIPATING. A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH MAY LIE NEAR 
JAMAICA TO THE WINDWARD PASSAGE BUT IS HARD TO ANALYZE WITH SPARSE 
OVERNIGHT OBS. SATELLITE LOOPING DOES IDENTIFY AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
OR ELONGATED LOW CENTER...STRETCHING FROM JUST WEST OF JAMAICA TO 
EASTERN CUBA. DEEP MOISTURE LIES EAST OF THE UPPER TROUGH...WHILE
A TONGUE OF DEEPER MOISTURE LIKEWISE HAS WRAPPED AROUND TO THE WEST 
SIDE OF THE FEATURE. THIS WHOLE SYNOPTIC PATTERN IS SHIFTING WEST 
CLOSER TO THE KEYS. MEANWHILE LOOKING IN THE OTHER DIRECTION...THE
UPSTREAM COLD FRONT THAT WELL BE TRACKING TOWARD THE KEYS...NOW
EXTENDS FROM NEAR NEW ORLEANS...ACROSS THE NW GULF...TO THE SOUTHERN 
TIP OF TEXAS. 

.FORECAST...
JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKING OF WIND AND WEATHER TRENDS HAS BEEN MADE TO 
THE ONGOING FORECAST PACKAGE FOR THE UPCOMING WEEK. THE EDGE OF 
DEEPER MOISTURE TO OUR EAST IS STILL EXPECTED TO WORK WEST JUST TO 
THE KEYS TONIGHT AND MONDAY. MODELS REMAIN IN RELATIVELY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH ARRIVAL OF THE SEASONS FIRST BONA FIDE COLD FRONT 
FOR THE KEYS MONDAY NIGHT. A WINDY PERIOD MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY MUCH LOWER RELATIVE HUMIDITY 
VALUES...AND TEMPERATURES PERHAPS 5-8 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. A QUICK 
TURN OF WIND FLOW TO ENE BY THURSDAY WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO 
MODERATE BACK TO NORMAL OR A BIT ABOVE. IN THE LONG RANGE...THE
EXTENDED GFS HAS BEEN VERY INCONSISTENT FROM RUN-TO-RUN REGARDING 
POSITIONING OF ANOTHER COLD FRONT NEXT SATURDAY. 

TODAY...SURFACE PRESSURES ARE FORECAST TO FALL A COUPLE OF MILLIBARS 
ALONG THE RIDGE AXIS TO OUR NORTH TODAY...THEREBY REDUCING LOCAL 
WIND SPEEDS DOWN TO 10 MPH OR LESS. LOW LEVEL WINDS FROM THE 
ENE...ALONG WITH SOME INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...MAY ALLOW 
OVER-ISLAND CUMULUS LINES AND TCUS TO FORM THIS AFTERNOON...LEADING 
TO A FEW SHOWERS. 20 PCT POPS WILL THEREFORE BE RETAINED. 

TONIGHT-MONDAY...GFS MODEL SHOWS MOISTURE INCREASING OVER THE KEYS 
AS THE MID TO HIGH LEVEL TROUGH NOW TO OUR EAST MOVES WEST TO THE 
KEYS. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW PRECIPITABLE WATER INCREASING TO 2 
INCHES OVER THE UPPER KEYS BY EARLY MONDAY. A SWATH OF DEEP LAYER 
LIFT IS ALSO INDICATED OVER OR NEAR THE KEYS. THE WRF MODEL IS MUCH 
STINGIER WITH THE MOISTURE INCREASE, HOWEVER.  AT THIS TIME...I WILL 
MAINTAIN 30 PCT POPS...GFS MOS SHOWS 40 PERCENTERS. A WEAK TROUGH 
PRECEDING THE ONCOMING FRONT SHOULD TURN AREA WINDS TO NORTH DURING 
THE DAY MONDAY.

MONDAY NIGHT...GFS, WRF, UKMET AND EUROPEAN MODELS ALL INDICATE A 
COLD FRONT PASSAGE OVER THE KEYS. THIS COULD OCCUR FAIRLY EARLY IN 
THE EVENING OVER THE KEYS. BASED ON COLD AIR ADVECTION OVER WARM 
OCEAN WATERS...AND MODELS FORECASTED PRESSURE GRADIENT...I HAVE
RAISED EXPECTED WIND SPEEDS A NOTCH. WELL SAY WINDY INSTEAD OF 
BREEZY. SEE MARINE SECTION. DRYING ALOFT SHOULD SET IN...BUT 
COLD-AIR RELATED LOW CLOUDS MAY PERSIST. LOW POPS AT 20 PCT ARE 
CARRIED...BUT LATEST GFS HAS 40 PCT...AND THIS MAY NEED REASSESSING. 
MIN TEMP FORECAST IS DIFFICULT. TEMPS COULD DROP SOME DURING TUESDAY 
MORNING...AFTER THE NORMAL MIN TEMP TIME OF DAY. 

TUESDAY-TUESDAY NIGHT...VERY DRY AIR IS INDICATED TO MOVE SOUTH DOWN 
THE PENINSULA AND OVER THE KEYS. ANY MORNING SHOWERS OUGHT TO COME 
TO AN END RATHER QUICKLY. HOPEFULLY ANY COLD AIR LOW CLOUDS WILL
THIN AS AIR TRAJECTORY TURNS TO COME OFF THE MAINLAND. LATEST MOS 
NUMBERS SHOW ONLY MID 70S FOR HIGHS TUESDAY...SO I HAVE ADJUSTED 
FORECAST MAX TEMPS DOWN INTO THE 75-80F RANGE FOR THIS PACKAGE. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...HIGH PRESSURE PASSING TO OUR NORTH SHOULD 
TURN WINDS MORE TO THE EAST. A GRADUAL RETURN OF TEMPS TO NORMAL OR 
A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL WILL ENSUE. ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AT MOST IS SEEN...AND THAT MAY BE TOO MUCH FOR WEDNESDAY 
WHEN DRY AIR IS STILL AROUND.

FRIDAY NIGHT-SATURDAY...SOME EXTENDED MODELS SHOW ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
NEAR OR APPROACHING THE KEYS SATURDAY...BUT THE TIMING IS VERY 
UNCERTAIN AT THIS EARLY STAGE. 
&&

.MARINE...
ENE WINDS NEAR 10 KT SHOULD SET IN BY AFTERNOON...AFTER A BIT HIGHER 
WINDS EARLY TODAY. WATCH FOR POSSIBLE WATERSPOUTS ON KEYS WATERS 
THIS AFTERNOON. A TURN OF WINDS TO NORTH 10 KT OR 10-15 KT IS 
EXPECTED MONDAY AHEAD OF AN ONCOMING FRONT. THE FRONT STILL APPEARS 
THAT IT WILL BRING STRONG WINDS MONDAY NIGHT...MAYBE ARRIVING EARLY 
IN THE EVENING FOR THE KEYS (LATE AFTERNOON OVER WATERS WEST OF KEY 
WEST). N TO NE WINDS 20-25 KT AND GUSTY MEANS SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES 
WILL LIKELY BE POSTED FOR MONDAY NIGHT ON INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY. 
CHECK ALL UPCOMING COASTAL WATERS FORECASTS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS WILL AFFECT 
THE ROUTE EARLY THIS MORNING...AND A FEW SHOWERS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF

SKIES WERE CLEAR THIS MORNING OVER THE ISLANDS WITH TEMPERATURES 
RIGHT AROUND 80 DEGREES. WINDS WERE FROM THE EAST OR NORTHEAST 5-10 
MPH ON LAND...10 KNOTS AT THE CMAN STATIONS. A CLOUD MASS EXISTED 
OVER THE WESTERN STRAITS AND OUR RADAR DETECTED A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS 
ABOUT 30 MILES OFF KEY WEST. IMAGERY SHOWED TRANSVERSE GRAVITY WAVES 
PROPAGATING SOUTHEAST THROUGH OUR AREA OF CONCERN WHICH SUGGESTED THE
PRESENCE OF STABLE LAYERS ALOFT. 

OUR MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED SOME INHIBITION AT 925 MB. A SECOND 
STABLE LAYER EXISTED ABOVE 800 MB. TOTAL COLUMN MOISTURE WAS 1.4 
INCHES.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
OUR MORNING MESO-PLOT SHOWS RIDGING ALONG THE PENINSULA WITH AN AXIS 
ALONG THE EAST COAST METRO. OFF SHORE FLOW EMANATING FROM THIS 
FEATURE IS HELPING TO KEEP SKIES CLEAR IN THE ISLANDS. THE 
INHIBITION IN OUR SOUNDING WILL BE OVERCOME WHEN TEMPERATURES REACH 
85 DEGREES...BUT THE INVERSION ABOVE 800 MB SHOULD HOLD -- IT IS 
SUSTAINED BY LARGE-SCALE RIDGING AT 700 MB WHICH ALSO IS PROMOTING

ALONG THE REEF. RECENT GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS DRY AIR ALOFT OVER

ALOFT...SMALL SHOWERS ARE SEEN ON RADAR WITHIN A FEW CLOUD LINES 
OVER THE OUTER FLORIDA STRAITS. WARM AND HUMID TROPICAL AIR PERSISTS 
AT THE SURFACE...WITH TEMPS IN THE UPPER 70S AND DEWPOINTS IN THE 
LOWER 70S. 

.FORECAST...
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE IN THE MORNING PACKAGE TO ONGOING 
FORECASTS. THE LATEST GFS AND WRF MODELS ARE RELATIVELY IN TUNE WITH 
EACH OTHER THROUGH THE NEAR TERM...WITH REGARD TO A MOIST TROUGH 
APPROACHING THE KEYS FROM THE EAST SUNDAY-MONDAY...FOLLOWED BY THE 
SEASONS FIRST COLD FRONT OVER THE KEYS MONDAY NIGHT. THE LATEST RUN 
OF THE EXTENDED GFS IS INCONSISTENT WITH TIMING AND POSITIONING OF A 
SECOND FRONT OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO IN A WEEK...BUT THIS IS BEYOND 
THE CURRENT FORECAST RANGE. 

TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY...WITH LOW LEVEL WINDS THAT MAY TEND SLIGHTLY 
NORTH OF DUE EAST...CUMULUS CLOUD LINES MAY FORM OVER OR NEAR 
ISLANDS EACH AFTERNOON. I WILL KEEP 10 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS GOING 
IN THE FORECAST FOR EACH PERIOD IN CASE OF A FEW TCUS LEADING TO 
SOME PRECIP. HOWEVER, FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE DRIER AIR ALOFT 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING COMPARED TO YESTERDAY WHEN A FEW SHOWERS 
DID MANAGE TO FORM. SUNDAY IS DIFFERENT...WITH INCREASING LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE SHOWN BY LATE AFTERNOON.

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...A DEEP LAYERED TROUGH (SURFACE TO 
ABOVE 500 MB) CURRENTLY EXTENDING OVER THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN AND 
DOMINICAN REPUBLIC...IS FORECAST TO MOVE WEST. THE LOWER LEVEL 
TROUGH AXIS (SURFACE TO 850 MB) IS SHOWN BY OPERATIONAL MODELS     
TO MOVE WEST INTO THE FLORIDA STRAITS SUNDAY NIGHT PRECEDED BY
INCREASING MOISTURE...WITH THE AXIS THEN REACHING THE KEYS EARLY 
MONDAY. MODELS OUTPUT STATISTICS HAVE ENHANCED CHANCE OF RAIN FOR 
THE PERIOD SUN NIGHT AND MON WITH GFS THE HIGHEST...SHOWING 40-50 
PCT FOR THE TWO PERIODS. FOR THIS FORECAST...I WILL MAINTAIN 30 PCT 
POPS...WITH MORE CLOUD COVER MONDAY. IF SUBSEQUENT PROGS ARE 
CONSISTENT WITH THIS TROUGH...THEN HIGHER CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THESE 
TWO PERIODS MAY BE WARRANTED. 

MONDAY NIGHT...EARLY MONDAY EVENING...A LOW LEVEL WIND SHIFT 
TO NORTHERLY WINDS WILL ARRIVE IN THE KEYS ACCORDING TO ALL MODELS.
THIS FEATURE AT LOW LEVELS...ACCOMPANIED BY A SHORT WAVE TROUGH AT 
MID LEVELS MOVING EAST...WILL IMPACT THE DEEP LAYERED TROUGH THAT IS 
EXPECTED TO HAVE ARRIVED OVER THE KEYS FROM THE EAST...SHEARING IT 
FROM ITS SOUTHERN END AND PUSHING THE DEEPER MOISTURE EAST AGAIN 
FROM THE KEYS. HIGHER CHANCE OF RAIN MAY BE NEEDED FOR MONDAY 
EVENING...BUT FOR NOW DUE TO TIMING UNCERTAINTY I WILL MAINTAIN THE 
ONGOING 20 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS. WIND SPEEDS WILL INCREASE IT 
SEEMS...INTO THE BREEZY CATEGORY. SEE MARINE SECTION AS WELL. AND...
LATEST GFS MOS SHOWS TEMPS DROPPING INTO THE LOWER TO MID 70S BEFORE 
NIGHT IS OVER. 

TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...QUITE DRY AIR IS SHOWN BY THE GFS TO 
SPILL SOUTH OFF THE MAINLAND AND OVER THE KEYS TUESDAY. ANY SHOWERS 
MAY BE LIMITED TO EARLY MORNING TUESDAY. BREEZY CONDITIONS APPEAR 
LIKELY FOR TUESDAY AS WELL...WITH DRIER AND LESS WARM CONDITIONS FOR 
THE FIRST TIME SINCE LAST SPRING. LATEST GFS MOS HAS TEMPS NOT 
BREAKING 80 ON TUESDAY...BUT ILL STICK WITH LOWER 80S FOR NOW. 
AS WINDS TURN NE TO E WEDNESDAY...A SLOW INCREASE IN DEWPOINTS AND 
TEMPERATURES IS INDICATED...AND ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IF 
ANY. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...A CONTINUED TURN OF WINDS TO E THEN 
SE THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH SPEEDS COMING DOWN INTO THE 10-15 MPH 
RANGE...WILL BRING TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS BACK UP AGAIN. LOOK FOR TEMPS 
A BIT ABOVE NORMAL BY END OF THE WEEK...IN THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S 
FOR A DAILY RANGE.

.CURRENTLY...
A PERSISTENT CLOUD LINE OVER THE LOWER KEYS CONTINUES TO GENERATE 
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE WESTERNMOST LOWER KEYS...WITH MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES BEING SEEN ELSEWHERE. MEANWHILE...SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A 
WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE POKING ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA...WITH A 
DEEPENING AREA OF LOW PRESSURE (991 MB) PULLING AN ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES AND THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. 
THIS BOUNDARY EXTENDS INTO THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO. GOES-12 WATER 
VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A WESTWARD MOVING DEEP LAYERED TROUGH OVER 
HISPANIOLA AND THE ADJACENT ATLANTIC AND CARIBBEAN WATERS. ACROSS 
THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE 

.FORECAST...
(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)
A COMPLEX WEATHER PATTERN IS SETTING UP FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AS 
A LENGTHY DEEP LAYERED RIDGE COVERING THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND THE 
ADJACENT ATLANTIC AND GULF WATERS WILL ERODE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS. THIS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO A DEEP LAYERED TROUGH DIGGING INTO 
THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES...WHILE ANOTHER DEEP LAYERED TROUGH 
MIGRATES WESTWARD ACROSS CENTRAL CUBA AND THE ADJACENT BAHAMAS AND 
WESTERN CARIBBEAN. BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES ALOFT...A WEAK WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL REMAIN NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA AS A COLD FRONT 
BECOMES STATIONARY OVER NORTH FLORIDA TONIGHT. ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
WILL ABSORB THE STATIONARY BOUNDARY AND DRIVE SOUTHEASTWARD AND PASS 
THROUGH THE FLORIDA KEYS MONDAY NIGHT. IN ADDITION...A LOW LEVEL 
TROUGH NEAR HISPANIOLA THIS EVENING WILL TRACK WESTWARD INTO THE 
NORTHWEST BAHAMAS AND EASTERN FLORIDA STRAITS. 

PRECIPITATION WISE...GIVEN AMPLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...A NORTHEAST TO 
EAST FLOW WILL GENERATE DIURNAL CLOUD LINES ALONG WITH LATE NIGHT 
AND EARLY MORNING ISOLATED SHOWERS. THEREAFTER...BECAUSE OF THE 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND EASTERLY TROUGH NEAR OUR 
REGION...SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED MONDAY AND 
MONDAY NIGHT. 

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...ALL GLOBAL MODELS INDICATE THE WEAK COLD 
FRONT WILL STALL OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS TUESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE 
GRADUALLY LIFTING NORTHWARD LATER IN THE WEEK. AFTER A BRIEF SPELL 
OF SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER AIR...MODERATING TEMPERATURES WILL 
RETURN TO OUR AREA FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK. THE MAIN 
CONCERN BECOMES THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE LOW LEVEL BOUNDARY 
INTERACTING WITH INCREASING MOISTURE BEGINNING WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WITH 
PLENTY OF UNCERTAINTY...WILL MAINTAIN ONLY 20 PERCENT POPS UNTIL 
CONFIDENCE INCREASES.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
FINE, BENIGN WEATHER CONDITIONS REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE FLORIDA 
KEYS THIS MORNING. A WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS WSW 
OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA CLOSE TO LAKE OKEECHOBEE...GIVING A 
GENERAL EAST WIND FLOW TO THE KEYS. WIND SPEEDS AT GAUGES ON THE 
ISLANDS, REEF, AND FLORIDA BAY ARE IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE. A SINGLE 
SYNOPTIC SHIP REPORT AT 2 AM WAS 27 NM SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS...
REPORTING EAST WINDS 9 KT. NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES ARE DETECTED ON 
KEY WEST NOR MIAMI DOPPLER RADARS...ONLY SOUTHBOUND BIRDS. IR 
SATELLITE SHOWS JUST LOW TOPPED CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER THE REGION. 
SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 70S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 
LOWER 70S. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY DEPICTS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 
AROUND 1.6 INCH NEAR THE LOWER KEYS...DRYING TO 1.4 INCH NEAR THE 
UPPER KEYS AND SOUTHERN PENINSULA. LAST EVENINGS OBSERVED SOUNDINGS 
SHOW THE DRY AIR TO BE MAINLY ABOVE 4 THSD FT AGL. 

.FORECAST...
EXCEPT FOR SOME NOISE AND ERRATIC WIND DIRECTIONS DURING PERIODS OF 
LIGHT WIND SPEEDS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS...THE LAST RUN OF THE GFS 
MODEL IS CONSISTENT WITH ONGOING FORECASTS...AND NO SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES ARE MADE IN THE MORNING FORECAST PACKAGE. MODELS ARE HOLDING 
FIRM WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE FIRST NOTICEABLE WEATHER FRONT OF THE 
FALL SEASON INTO THE KEYS SOMETIME LATE MONDAY NIGHT OR EARLY 
TUESDAY.

MEANWHILE...
TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...THE WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS MOST OF THIS TIME...
PRODUCING A MAINLY EAST WIND FLOW 10 KT OR LESS. DURING THIS TIME...
AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OR HIGH CENTER IS FORECAST TO LIE NEAR OR JUST 
NORTH OF THE KEYS AS WELL...MAINTAINING DRY AIR ALOFT AND WEAK 
SUBSIDING AIR OVER THE REGION. LIGHT SURFACE WIND FLOW (E OR ENE AT 
TIMES) WOULD NORMALLY BE FAVORABLE FOR DAYTIME TCU FORMATION OVER 
THE KEYS...BUT DRYNESS JUST ABOVE THE BOUNDARY LAYER OUGHT TO THWART 
CONVECTIVE CLOUD GROWTH. POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED AT 10 PCT FOR EACH 
PERIOD THROUGH SAT NIGHT...BUT THIS MAY BE GENEROUS. DAILY 
TEMPERATURE RANGES WILL REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL. 

SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...GFS MODEL (BUT NOT THE WRF) SHOW A 
MOISTENING UP OF THE LOWER LEVELS SUNDAY...THEN A PERIOD OF DEEPER 
MOISTURE OVER THE KEYS AND AREAS TO OUR EAST SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
MONDAY NIGHT. THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE CURRENTLY NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA IS 
FORECAST TO SHIFT TO OUR SOUTH AS A PERIOD OF WESTERLIES ALOFT SET 
IN. NO WELL-DEFINED SHORT WAVES TROUGHS MOVING EAST IN THE UPPER 
LEVEL FLOW ARE IDENTIFIABLE. HOWEVER, BOTH THE GFS AND WRF SHOW 
ONSET OF A DEEP LAYERED TROUGH (YES, SURFACE TO ABOVE 500 MB) FROM 
THE NW CARIBBEAN EXTENDING NE TO THE BAHAMAS. THE WESTERN EDGE OF 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE IS FORECAST TO EDGE CLOSE TO 
THE KEYS...OR OVER THE KEYS. CURRENT ELEVATED POPS (30 PCT) FOR MON 
AND MON NIGHT WILL BE RETAINED...AND MAYBE SUNDAY NIGHT COULD BE 
AFFECTED AS WELL. 

TUESDAY...GFS AND EUROPEAN EXTENDED PROGS ARE CONSISTENT WITH ONSET 
OF BREEZY NNE WINDS BY EARLY TUESDAY. SOME DRYING AT THE SURFACE...
AND MAX TEMPS NEAR CLIMO INSTEAD OF ABOVE ARE INDICATED. 

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...THE NE BREEZES OVER THE KEYS WILL 
PROBABLY PERSIST THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...ALONG WITH SOME LOWER 
DEWPOINTS AND TEMPS NEAR OR MAYBE A DEGREE OR SO BELOW CLIMO. HIGH 
PRESSURE PUSHING EAST OVER THE U.S. ATLANTIC COAST WILL TURN WINDS 
TO EAST BY WED...STILL 15 MPH OR SO...WITH TEMPS NEAR NORMAL. THE 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO BUILD BACK CLOSE TO SOUTH 
FLORIDA...SO CHANCES OF RAIN SHOULD REMAIN LOW. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS WILL KEEP WINDS 
MAINLY FROM THE EAST...10 KT OR LESS TODAY...THEN NEAR 10 KT TONIGHT 
THROUGH SAT NIGHT OVER ATLANTIC SIDE WATERS. SOME ERRATIC WINDS WILL 
BE SEEN OVER GULF AND BAY WATERS IN THE AFTERNOONS AS SEA BREEZE 
CIRCULATIONS SET IN OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA. A TURN OF 
WINDS TO N-NE WITH A PICK UP OF SPEEDS TO 10-15 KT IS EXPECTED 
MONDAY SOMETIME...COULD BE MONDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE SPREADING 
OVER FLORIDA TUESDAY WILL GIVE NE WINDS PROBABLY AT LEAST IN THE 
15-20 KT RANGE BUT MIGHT BE A BIT MORE. CAUTIONARY HEADLINES OR 
MAYBE EVEN SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES COULD BE REQUIRED FOR TUESDAY. 
&&

(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)
A DEEP LAYERED (1000-500 MB) ANTICYCLONE EXTENDING FROM THE GULF OF 
MEXICO ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC 
WILL GRADUALLY FLATTEN AND ERODE THIS WEEKEND. THIS WILL BE RESPONSE 
TO A SERIES OF SHORT WAVE TROUGHS ROTATING AROUND A LONG WAVE TROUGH 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES. MEANWHILE...A COLD FRONT 
OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES REACHING INTO THE EXTREME WESTERN 
UNITED STATES WILL DROP SOUTHEASTWARD...BEFORE BECOMING EAST-WEST 
ORIENTED AND STATIONARY OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA AND THE ADJACENT GULF AND ATLANTIC WATERS. IN ADVANCE OF

EXTENDED PERIOD(MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)
A PROGRESSIVE AND DEEPENING MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE 
EASTERN UNITED STATES AND FLORIDA PENINSULA WILL HELP DRIVE A WEAK 
COLD FRONT DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...AND POSSIBLE THROUGH THE 
FLORIDA KEYS LATE MONDAY. THEREAFTER...THE DEEP CYCLONIC CIRCULATION 
WILL LIFT OUT QUICKLY AS AN AMPLIFYING RIDGE MIGRATES EASTWARD INTO

THE WEAK AND THIN HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS OVER SOUTH FLORIDA WILL

REASONABLE TO KEEP A SMALL MENTION OF SHOWERS IN THE MORNING 
FORECAST. WILL HANG ON TO THAT SMALL MENTION ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE

HOLDS...ACROSS THE IMMEDIATE AREA. A LAZY FRONT WILL BE HELD OFF 
WELL NORTH OF OUR LATITUDE. TEMPERATURES THROUGH SUNDAY WILL BE A 
COUPLE OF DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGE.

IN THE EXTENDED PERIODS...MONDAY AND BEYOND...
THE GFS MAINTAINS A MORE VIGOROUS FRONT IN NORTH FLORIDA EARLY 
MONDAY...CROSSING SOUTH FLORIDA LATE MONDAY...AND THEN THE KEYS 
EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. THIS IS NOW GAINING MORE SUPPORT FROM OTHER 
LONGER RANGE MODELS...SO CONFIDENCE IS INCREASING FOR THAT SCENARIO. 
HOWEVER...THE MOISTURE FIELD IS SHEARING APART AS THE FRONT CROSSES 
SOUTH FLORIDA. AND...INSTABILITY DOES NOT LOOK VERY INTIMIDATING 
ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT...NOR IS THEIR ANY SHARP FEATURES 
DEPICTED IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER LEVELS DURING THAT TIME. SO AT THIS 
POINT I WILL ONLY KEEP THE MENTION OF SHOWERS WITH THE INCREASED

SLIGHT CHANCE POP. OTHERWISE EXPECT THIS EVENING TO BE MOSTLY CLEAR

FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...THE SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN BECOMES DIFFUSE 
AND THE GRADIENT WEAKENS OVER THE KEYS AS A LOW PUSHES OFF THE NEW 
ENGLAND COAST AND A TRAILING FRONTAL BOUNDARY DRAPES ACROSS NORTH 
FLORIDA. BOTH THE WRF AND THE GFS HAVE THE BOUNDARY DISSOLVING OVER 
NORTH FLORIDA. WINDS OVER THE CWA WILL BE SOMEWHAT LIGHT AND

THE GFS HAS BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT OVER THE LAST SEVERAL RUNS WITH 
BRINGING THE FIRST COLD FRONT OF THE YEAR INTO THE KEYS ON TUESDAY 
MORNING. THE WINDS WILL VEER SOUTHWESTERLY IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT 
ON MONDAY...BUT THE PRESSURE GRADIENT IN ADVANCE OF THE BOUNDARY 
REMAINS WEAK. WAY TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE ON PRECIPITATION...BUT 
GIVEN THE CURRENT MODEL SOLUTION WOULD ONLY ANTICIPATE LIMITED

A GENTLE EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZE IS BLOWING ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA 
WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TAKING UP RESIDENCE ACROSS SOUTH 
FLORIDA. IR SATELLITE LOOP SHOWS A THICK SLUG OF CI IS SHIFTING 
SOUTH OF THE ISLANDS EARLY THIS MORNING. ONLY SMALL PATCHES OF CU 
DRIFTING CLOSE TO THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE MAINLAND AT THIS 
HOUR...AND KBYX RADAR CONTINUES TO BE QUIET TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES

.FORECAST...
A MID TO UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PORTION OF 
THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL FLATTEN A LITTLE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS BUT 
IT EASTERN EXTENSION WILL REACH ACROSS CENTRAL AND THEN SOUTHERN 
FLORIDA. THE SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE ATLANTIC WILL 
REMAIN ALIGNED JUST TO OUR NORTH...MAINTAINING A GENTLE MAINLY EAST 
BREEZE IN PLACE. IN THE SHORT TERM...WILL BE A STRETCH TO GET A 
SHOWER ANYWHERE IN THE SERVICE AREA GIVEN THE LIMITED MOISTURE 
EXPECTED. SO WILL DROP THE POP GRIDS FOR TODAY FOR THE ENTIRE 
SERVICE AREA...AND THEN JUST A MINIMAL MENTION FOR TONIGHT THROUGH 
THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST. THE LOWER PRESSURES NORTH OF PUERTO 
RICO ARE NOT EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN OR MOVE IN ANY DIRECTION TOWARDS 
THE MAINLAND U.S.  A WEAK FRONT WILL DROP INTO FLORIDA ON FRIDAY AND 
THEN STALL AND LOSE DEFINITION ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA ON SATURDAY. 

LOOKING INTO THE EXTENDED PORTION OF THE FORECAST...EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...THE GFS IS STILL PUSHING A MORE DEFINED FRONT THROUGH SOUTH 
FLORIDA. BY TUESDAY MORNING...IT CLEARS THE KEYS WITH A MARKED 
DIFFERENCE IN AIRMASS. AT THIS POINT...IT IS STILL UNCLEAR WHETHER 
THIS SOLUTION WILL PAN OUT...BUT MORE OF THE LONG RANGE FORECASTS 
ARE SUPPORTING THIS SOLUTION TO VARIOUS DEGREES. WILL NOT ADJUST 
POPS OR TEMPS FOR THOSE LATE PERIODS AT THIS TIME AS THERE IS STILL 
A POSSIBILITY THAT FRONT MAY ALSO STALL ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA.

LOW PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES IS PRESSING 
EASTWARD...PUSHING OUT THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA THAT HAS CONTRIBUTED 
TO THE HIGHER WINDS IN OUR AREA THE LAST FEW DAYS. THE RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE TRAILING SOUTHWARD FROM THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN SHOVED 
SOUTHWARD CLOSER TO OUR AREA...AND AS A RESULT WINDS HAVE BECOME 
MAINLY SOUTHEAST AND DECREASED IN SPEED TODAY. ALONG THE ISLANDS 
WINDS ARE CURRENTLY AROUND 10 MPH...AND AT THE CMAN STATIONS ARE 
NEAR 10 KT...EXCEPT 10 TO 15 KT WEST OF KEY WEST TO BEYOND DRY 
TORTUGAS AND OVER THE STRAITS TO THE SOUTH. TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN 
INTO THE MID 80S UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 
LOWER 70S. KBYX RADAR DETECTS NO RAIN IN OR NEAR OUR AREA.

.FORECAST...
TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE AFOREMENTIONED SURFACE RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN NEAR OR JUST NORTH OF OUR AREA 
RESULTING IN LIGHTER GENERALLY EAST WINDS. WIND SPEEDS WILL DROP A 
BIT FURTHER TONIGHT THEN REMAIN FAIRLY CONSTANT FROM TOMORROW 
MORNING ON. MODEL FORECAST VERITCAL PROFILES AND SATELLITE IMAGERY 
ALSO INDICATE THAT ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL BE RATHER LOW THROUGH 
THIS PERIOD AS DRIER CONTINENTAL AIR MOVES AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF 
THE RIDGE. IN LIGHT OF LOWER WIND SPEEDS AND RELATIVELY DRY AIR...AS 
WELL AS PERSISTENCE...WILL REMOVE SHOWERS FROM THE PUBLIC FORECAST 
FOR TONIGHT AND RETAIN ONLY 10 POPS WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...
WITH THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINING NEAR OUR AREA...WIND 
SPEEDS WILL REMAIN LIGHT THROUGH THIS PERIOD...AND A RATHER BENIGN 
WEATHER PATTERN WILL TAKE HOLD. WHILE ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL 
INCREASE SOMEWHAT...THE PEAK DAYS OF SUMMER CONVECTION ARE GONE AND 
SOME SUBSIDENCE...COMBINED WITH A LACK OF LARGE-SCALE LIFTING 
MECHANISMS...SUPPORTS INHERITED 20 POPS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THERE 
IS SOME DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE COMPUTER MODELS AS TO HOW FAR SOUTH 
THE RIDGE WILL BE AT ANY GIVEN TIME...WHICH IN TURN AFFECTS WIND 
DIRECTION IN OUR AREA. AT SEVERAL POINTS THE GFS AND NAM ARE TOTALLY 
OPPOSITE IN THEIR WIND DIRECTION...BUT AT SPEEDS GENERALLY LESS THAN 
10 KT. IN LIGHT OF THIS UNCERTAINTY AND THE LOW SPEEDS...WILL 
MAINTAIN CLIMATOLOGICALLY FAVORED GENERALLY EAST WIND DIRECTION 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD.

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
THINGS ARE A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING IN THE FAR EXTENDED PERIOD DUE 
TO THE 12Z GFS RUN...WHICH PLOWS A WELL-DEFINED COLD FRONT THROUGH 
THE KEYS ON MONDAY NIGHT/EARLY MONDAY MORNING. PREVIOUS GFS RUNS 
HAVE STALLED THIS BOUNDARY WELL NORTH OF OUR AREA...SO IT IS WAY TOO 
EARLY TO JUMP ON SOMETHING LIKE THIS. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE 
HOW THE NEXT COUPLE OF RUNS HANDLE THE SYSTEM...WILL THEY CONTINUE

KBYX RADAR IS COMPLETELY VOID OF ECHOES THIS MORNING. EARLY MORNING 
IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW DISSIPATING CI SLIDING DOWN THE EXTREME 
SOUTHEAST SECTION OF FLORIDA AND THE KEYS...WITH ELEVATED CU POCKETS 
TO THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST OF THE ISLAND CHAIN. THE HIGH PRESSURE 
AXIS ALIGNED FROM THE SOUTHEAST COAST THROUGH SOUTH FLORIDA HAS 
ALLOWED WINDS TO SLACKEN OVER MUCH OF THE SERVICE AREA...AND ARE NOW 
E/SE CLOSE TO 15 KNOTS ON AVERAGE AT THE CMANS. THE EXCEPTION IS IN 
THE WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST TO BEYOND DRY TORTUGAS WHERE SPEEDS ARE 
STILL CLOSE TO 20 KNOTS. THE ISLAND SENSORS ARE NOW BETWEEN 10 AND 
15 MPH...WITH INTERMITTENT GUSTINESS STILL FELT IN KEY WEST.

.FORECAST...
THE LARGE HIGH HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO LIFT NORTHEAST PAST THE 
NEW ENGLAND COAST. THE LONG SOUTHWESTWARD EXTENSION OF THIS HIGH 
WILL REMAIN ALIGNED ACROSS THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS AND SOUTH FLORIDA 
FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS WILL BE 
CHARACTERIZED BY HIGHER HEIGHTS OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHEASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO DURING THIS TIME. RELATIVELY DRY AIR WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE PULLED INTO SERVICE AREA AND RAIN CHANCES LOOK EXTREMELY LIMITED 
IN THE SHORT TERM. THIS IS REFLECTED IN BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MOS 
NUMBERS. HAVE THEREFORE DROPPED THE POP GRIDS BELOW 10 PERCENT AND 
ELIMINATE THE MENTION EVERYWHERE...EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE MARINE ZONE 
WEST OF KEY WEST WHERE SOME RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL FORCING MAY SQUEEZE A 
SHOWER OR TWO OUT. WILL MAKE A LAST MINUTE DECISION THERE. 

LOOKING FROM TONIGHT THROUGH THE LATE PORTION OF THE WEEK...WILL 
CONTINUE TO DEVIATE FROM GFS AS FAR AS THE SURFACE PATTERN IS 
CONCERNED. ALTHOUGH NOT AS AGRESSIVE AS PREVIOUS RUNS...THE GFS HAS 
BEEN DIPPING THE RIDGE AXIS SOUTH OF OUR LATITUDE AS EARLY AS 
WEDNESDAY ALLOWING FOR A MORE VEERED STEERING FLOW. NO OTHER MODEL 
SUPPORTS THIS...AND AM STILL LEANING TOWARDS EVERY OTHER SOLUTION 
WHICH CALLS FOR A PERSISTENT MAINLY EAST FLOW. PECULIARLY...THE GFS 
HAS DIPPED EVEN DRIER AIR THROUGH THE 5 TO 10 KFT LAYER EVEN THOUGH 
IT TURNS THAT FLOW BACK AROUND THROUGH THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST 
TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. EARLIER RUNS HAD A MARKED DIFFERENCE IN 
MOISTURE WITH THAT TRANSITION. ANYWAY...ITS MOS POP NUMBERS ARE NOW 
COMING IN EVEN LOWER THAN THE NAM DURING THOSE TIMES. HAVE ACTUALLY 
CUT OUR RAIN CHANCES TO 10 PERCENT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

FOR LATER PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST...THURSDAY THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...WILL CONTINUE WITH OUR ONGOING FORECAST WITH SMALL RAIN 
CHANCES AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES AS A FEW FRONTS ARE 
EXPECTED TO DIE/STALL NORTH OF THE KEYS.

KEY ON THE GULF SIDE. HOWEVER...OVER WESTERN WATERS DRY TORTUGAS HAS 
BEEN SOLIDLY SUSTAINED JUST OVER 20 KT FROM THE ESE...WITH GUSTS OF 
25 KT OR GREATER. PRESSURES REMAIN LOW OVER THE WESTERN GULF DUE TO 
A LOW PRESSURE CENTER MOVING OVER TEXAS...AND AS A RESULT WINDS 
REMAIN STRONGER TO OUR WEST THAN TO OUR EAST AND NORTH. RADARS HAVE 
BEEN QUIET ALL DAY...AND LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW ONLY 
FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS OVER THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. GOES

MARINERS WILL BE INTERESTED IN TRENDS...WHICH STILL POINT TO 
GRADUALLY IMPROVING WIND AND SEA CONDITIONS MAINLY STARTING TUESDAY.
BIG QUESTIONS STILL LOOM OVER WIND PATTERNS WEDNESDAY THROUGH

I WILL NOT INTRODUCE ANY HIGHER CHANCE OF RAIN THAN 20 PCT FOR THE 
UPCOMING WEEK. 

TONIGHT...EAST WINDS AROUND 15 MPH AND GUSTY (MAYBE SUSTAINED A BIT 
HIGHER THROUGH EVENING) WILL KEEP OVERNIGHT KEYS MINIMUM TEMPS CLOSE 
TO 80F. MODELS INDICATE A MINOR INCREASE IN LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE 
AFTER MIDNIGHT...SO THEREFORE I WILL RETAIN 10 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
OVERNIGHT ALTHOUGH IN TRUTH WE MAY NOT SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT SHOWERS 
AT ALL. 

TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...A GRADUAL DECREASE IN WINDS OVER THE 
AREA STILL APPEARS IN STORE AS HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH WEAKENS 
AND ORIENTS INTO AN EAST-WEST RIDGE OVER FLORIDA. DRY AIR ALOFT AND 
AN AND UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE NEAR THE KEYS MAKES SHOWER CHANCES 
APPEAR SLIM TO NONE. 10 PCT POPS ARE CARRIED. 

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...HERE IS WHERE I AM PARTING WITH THE 
GFS MODEL FOR PRESSURE PATTERN AND WINDS. GRANTED THE GFS FOR THE 
PAST 4 RUNS HAS SHOWN THAT THE RIDGE WILL SLIP SOUTH OF THE KEYS. 
PRIOR GFS RUNS DID NOT PUSH THE RIDGE THAT FAR SOUTH...AND CURRENT 
OUTPUT FROM THE WRF, UKMET, AND EUROPEAN MODELS ALL SHOW A LIGHT E 
WIND FLOW PERSISTING OVER THE KEYS WITH A RIDGE STILL TO OUR NORTH. 
HIGHER POPS ARE CARRIED BY THE GFS FOR WED NIGHT...WHICH APPEARS
DUE TO HIGHER MOISTURE FORECAST TO SWING INTO SOUTH FLORIDA. THERE 
IS ALSO A STEERING FLOW SHOWN BY THE GFS WHICH WOULD TAKE SOUTH 
FLORIDA MAINLAND SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON SOUTH INTO THE KEYS. 
AT THIS TIME...IN LEANING TOWARD THE MODELS OTHER THAN THE GFS...
I WILL KEEP POPS LOW AT 20 PCT. 

THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...THERE IS STILL A CONTINUATION OF 
DISAGREEMENT OF THE GFS WITH ALL OTHER AVAILABLE OPERATIONAL MODELS 
OUT IN TIME THROUGH SATURDAY. THE GFS INDICATES A CONVOLUTED 
PRESSURE PATTERN WITH DYING AND STALLING TROUGHS EAST OF FLORIDA 
TRAILING BACK TO NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA. ALTERNATE MODELS KEEP A LIGHT 
EAST WIND FLOW OVER THE KEYS. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...PERSISTENCE WILL BE CARRIED DUE TO 
VERY LOW CONFIDENCE IN SUBSEQUENT FRONTAL SYSTEMS FORECAST BY THE 
GFS TO MOVE SOUTH INTO PART OF FLORIDA. 
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO COME DOWN ONLY SLIGHTLY OVERNIGHT...IN THE 
15-20 KT RANGE OFF MOST OF THE KEYS BUT STILL STAYING NEAR 20 KT 
OVER WESTERN WATERS AND AROUND DRY TORTUGAS. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY 
WILL BE UP FOR WATERS KEY WEST TO BEYOND DRY TORTUGAS FOR WINDS AND 
SEAS...AND ELSEWHERE ON ATLANTIC WATERS OCEAN REEF TO KEY WEST DUE

335 AM EDT MON OCT 16 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
VERY SHALLOW AND SMALL ECHOES ARE PULSING WELL OUT IN THE STRAITS 
THIS MORNING...WELL SOUTH OF THE MARQUESAS KEYS. A FRESH BREEZE 
REMAINS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS AND EVEN MORESO IN THE 
WEST WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS WHERE THEY ARE ACCOMPANIED BY 
OCCASIONALLY STRONG GUSTS. ANALYSIS SHOWS A DECREASE ACROSS THE GULF 
WATERS ADJACENT TO THE LOWER KEYS AND IN FLORIDA BAY SINCE LATE 
YESTERDAY. ONLY A FEW CLOUDS ARE EVIDENT ON IR IMAGES THIS 
MORNING...MOSTLY IN THE WATERS SOUTH/SOUTHWEST OF THE LOWER KEYS. 
TEMPERATURES ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE STILL IN THE LOWER 80S AT 
THIS HOUR.

.FORECAST...
THE CONCERN FOR THE FORECAST THIS MORNING REMAINS THE WINDS. IN THE 
SHORT TERM...THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE HIGHER WINDS WILL 
REMAIN CONCENTRATED TO THE WEST/SOUTHWEST OF THE ISLAND CHAIN WITH 
RESIDUAL GUSTINESS CONTINUING ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS. BY TONIGHT...THE EXTENSION OF THE HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE 
ATLANTIC ALLOWS THE GRADIENT ACROSS THE LOCAL AREA TO RELAX AND 
WINDS TO DECREASE. THE GFS CONTINUES TO BUCKLE THE HIGH PRESSURE 
ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND ALLOWS THE BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS TO TURN 
THROUGH THE SOUTH LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND EVEN TO THE NORTHWEST TO 
NORTH FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. ALTHOUGH THE GFS HAS BEEN 
CONSISTENT WITH THIS FOR A FEW RUNS...IT HAS NO SUPPORT FROM ANY 
OTHER MODEL. BUT AS A WEAK RIDGE AXIS SHOULD STAY CLOSE TO OUR 
LATITUDE THROUGH THAT TIME...WILL KEEP A PREDOMINANTLY EASTERLY 
COMPONENT TO THE WIND GRIDS FOR THOSE PERIODS ON THIS FORECAST. WIND 
DIRECTION MAY NEED TO BE ADJUSTED ON LATER SHIFTS...BUT THE SPEEDS 
SHOULD BE LIGHT OR GENTLE REGARDLESS. A RISE IN HEIGHTS FOR THE 
MIDDLE AND UPPER LEVELS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN GULF AND SOUTH FLORIDA 
WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES QUITE SMALL FOR MUCH OF THIS FORECAST. 
AGAIN...THE GFS TRIES TO DROP A LOW LEVEL TROUGH AND PERIODIC LIFT 
ALOFT THROUGH FLORIDA FOR WEDNESDAY AND EARLY THURSDAY...BUT THIS 
LOOKS OVERDONE. WILL MAKE NO ADJUSTMENTS TO THE ONGOING SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS AND TEMPERATURES JUST ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGE FOR THE 
DURATION OF THIS WEEK. A MORE DEFINED FRONT WILL PUSH INTO FLORIDA 
ON FRIDAY AND SHOULD STALL/WEAKEN TO OUR NORTH THIS WEEKEND.

&&

.MARINE...
WILL ALLOW THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY TO EXPIRE OVER THE BAY AND GULF 
WATERS WITH THE UPCOMING COASTAL WATERS ISSUANCE. RESIDUAL SEAS WITH 
GUSTY WINDS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS...AND ESPECIALLY 
WEST/SOUTHWEST OF THE LOWER KEYS...WILL WARRANT A CONTINUATION OF 
THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY IN THOSE ZONES TODAY. CONDITIONS WILL 
SLOWLY DIMINISH ALL AREAS TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. AS STATED 
ABOVE...EVEN THOUGH THERE IS CONFLICTING GUIDANCE ON WIND DIRECTION 
FROM MID-WEEK THROUGH FRIDAY...BREEZES WILL BE MOSTLY GENTLE IN ALL 
MARINE ZONES.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...VFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE KMIA-KEYW AND 
AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. JUST A FEW CLOUDS ARE 
EXPECTED BETWEEN 030 TO 040 WITH SOME PATCHES OF ALTOCU BETWEEN 
080-100. EXPECTED SUSTAINED EAST WINDS BETWEEN 13 AND 15

OUR GOING FORECASTS LOOK GOOD. WE PLAN NO UPDATES OR CHANGES IN OUR 
UPCOMING PACKAGE. WE COULD USE SOME MORE SHIP REPORTS WITH SEA 
CONDITIONS IN THE STRAITS. OUR PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS.
&&
...................................................................
.FORECAST...
NO MAJOR CHANGES ARE BEING MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS. THE LATEST GFS 
RUN HAS SERIOUS DIFFERENCES FROM PRIOR RUNS FOR THE PERIOD WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH FRIDAY WITH REGARD TO PRESSURE PATTERNS AND WIND FLOW. SINCE 
THE EUROPEAN MODEL (12Z) RUN JUST IN MAINTAINS CONTINUITY WITH PRIOR 
RUNS...I WILL FOR NOW SHY AWAY FROM THE GFS INDICATIONS OF A WEST TO 
NORTHWEST WIND FLOW SETTING IN DURING THE WED-FRI TIME PERIOD. 

TONIGHT...MODELS KEEP SURFACE WINDS NEAR 20 KT MUCH OF THE NIGHT 
OVER KEYS WATERS. DRY AIR ALOFT OVER MOST OF THE KEYS LIMITS 
POPS...BUT MORE SIGNIFICANT FAST-MOVING SHOWERS WILL BE SEEN IN THE 
STRAITS WHERE MOISTURE IS DEEPER. EAST WIND FLOW WILL KEEP TEMPS NO 
LOWER THE UPPER 70S. 

MON-TUE...CONTINUED SOMEWHAT DRY AIR ALOFT IS SHOWN TO STAY IN 
PLACE...AND MOS POPS ARE GENERALLY 10 PCT OR LESS...SO ZONES WILL 
SO INDICATE. EARLY MONDAY MAY SEE WINDS STILL NEAR 20 KT OVER 
SOUTHERN AND WESTERN WATERS...BUT A SLIGHT DOWN TREND IN WINDS OVER 
THE AREA IS INDICATED. 

TUE NIGHT...A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE...20 PCT POPS WILL BE
CARRIED...BUT GFS SHOWS LIFTED INDEX VALUES STILL NOT VERY LOW
(MINUS 1 OR HIGHER)...THUS I WONT MENTION THUNDER. 

WED-FRI...AS ADDRESSED IN THE TOP PARAGRAPH...THE LATEST GFS RUN
BRINGS WINDS TO NW AND/OR W WITH A LOW TO OUR NORTH. WRF FOR WED
KEEPS E WINDS GOING...LATEST EUROPEAN HAS EAST WINDS IN PLACE...
WHILE UKMET VAGUELY SUGGESTS THE SAME. 

FRI NIGHT-SUN...ALL DEPENDS ON FATE OF A VERY WEAK FRONT ENTERING 
THE SE U.S. AND FLORIDA. NO CHANGES ARE SHOWN IN FORECASTS. 
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS FROM THE E SHOULD REMAIN BLOWING CLOSE TO 20 KT OVER MOST KEYS 
WATERS THROUGH THE NIGHT...SO SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES REMAIN UP. A 
GRADUAL DOWN TREND IN SPEEDS...INTO THE 15-20 KT RANGE FOR BAY AND 
GULF WATERS...IS EXPECTED MONDAY...AND MAYBE FOR STRAITS OFF THE 
UPPER KEYS AS WELL BEFORE THE DAY IS OVER. LOOK FOR MORE IMPROVEMENT 
WITH WIND SPEEDS TUE AND TUE NIGHT. AT THIS TIME...A BIG QUESTION ON 
WIND DIRECTIONS IS INDICATED FOR WED-FRI...BUT SPEEDS ARE NOT 
EXPECTED TO BE MORE THAN 10-15 KT. 
&&

...................................................................

.AVIATION...

VFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE OVERNIGHT THROUGH 
MONDAY. FEW-SCT CLOUDS BASED FROM FL030 TO FL040 WILL CONTINUE TO 
AFFECT THE KEYS AND COASTAL AREAS OF THE METRO MIAMI AREA FROM TIME 
TO TIME. THERE IS STILL A POTENTIAL FOR ALTOCUMULUS WITH BASES FL080 
TO FL090 LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY. SURFACE WINDS ARE NOT AS 
GUSTY OVER THE KMTH AND KEYW TERMINALS...HOWEVER OCCASIONAL GUSTS IN 
EXCESS OF 15 KT CANNOT BE RULED OUT. THIS EVENING...EAST WINDS ARE 
NEAR 20 KT OFF THE SURFACE THROUGH ABOUT 3000 FEET AGL...THEN

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
345 PM EDT SAT OCT 14 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SUGGEST THE REMNANTS OF A 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY...LOCATED AT 2 PM BY A RAGGED LOW LEVEL CLOUD LINE 
EXTENDING SW OVER THE ATLANTIC ALMOST TO PALM BEACH...THENCE WEST 
ALMOST TO FT. MYERS. WINDS NORTH OF THIS BOUNDARY ARE NE SUSTAINED 
15 KT BUT GUSTING TO 20 KT OR MORE AT THE BEACHES. MUCH DRIER LOW 
LEVEL AIR STILL LAGS BEHIND THE WIND SHIFT AND INCREASE. MEANWHILE...
THE EXPECTED FRONTOLYSIS OF THE BOUNDARY IS STARTING...WHICH IS 
SIGNALED BY A TURN OF SURFACE WINDS TO NE WITH SOME INCREASE IN 
SPEED SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY. KEYS AREA WINDS (STILL WELL SOUTH OF 
THE BOUNDARY) IN THE PAST 2 HOURS HAVE GONE FROM N TO NE...AND 
SPEEDS ARE GUSTING TO 15 KT OR SO AT C-MAN SITES. OF NOTE IS THAT 
THE EAST GULF BUOY 42003 IS REPORTING ENE WINDS 19 KT GUSTING TO 21 
KT...WHICH IS ABOUT 3 KT OVER WHAT ALL MODELS ARE INDICATING FOR THE 
18Z TIME PERIOD (2 PM). AREA RADARS SHOW A LINE OF SHOWERS MOVING 
ONTO THE PALM BEACH COUNTY COAST...ALONG THE REMNANT FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. IN ADDITION...ENOUGH MOISTURE IS PRESENT FOR A FEW SEA 
BREEZE SHOWERS OVER THE SE FLORIDA PENINSULA...AND FOR A FEW SHOWERS 
WITHIN A COUPLE OF CLOUD LINES OVER AND OFFSHORE FROM THE KEYS. 
&&

.FORECAST...
A QUICK TURN OF LOW LEVEL TRAJECTORIES TO COME FROM THE NE AT THE 
KEYS LATITUDE OVERNIGHT STILL IS INDICATED IN MODELS...AND THE 
RESULT OF THIS IS TO KEEP ANY SIGNIFICANT (OR DISCERNIBLE) COOL AIR 
ADVECTION FROM ENTERING THE KEYS.

FORECAST PROBLEMS INCLUDE THE AMOUNT OF SHOWER ACTIVITY WITHIN THE 
RAGGED CLOUD LINE WHICH OUGHT TO SURVIVE AS IT MOVES SW OVER THE 
KEYS TONIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY. AND SECONDLY...FOR MARINE 
INTERESTS...THE WIND SPEEDS WHICH WILL SET IN TONIGHT AND CONTINUE 
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING. GUT FEELING INDICATES WINDS MAY PEAK OUT 
JUST A BIT HIGHER THAN MODELS HAVE BEEN INDICATING...IN OTHER WORDS 
AROUND 20 KT AT TIMES WHICH WILL REQUIRE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORIES ON 
SOME OR ALL KEYS WATERS. 

TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...BOTH THE WRF AND GFS MODELS INDICATE A LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE MAXIMUM MOVING SW OVER THE KEYS...WHICH IS RELATED TO 
THE REMNANTS OF THE OLD DYING FRONTAL BOUNDARY. NO TEMPERATURE 
CONTRAST IS INDICATED WITH THIS FEATURE...JUST SOME LOW LEVEL SPEED 
CONVERGENCE AND A BIT DEEPER MOISTURE. THE GFS...WHICH UP TIL NOW 
HAS BEEN INDICATING 30 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR TONIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY...HAS LOWERED ITS MOS POPS TO 20 PCT. THE WRF ON THE OTHER 
HAND...WHICH HAD LOW POPS PREVIOUSLY...HAS NOW GENERATED 30 PCT POPS 
FOR TONIGHT AND MONDAY. SEEING THE SMALL LINE OF SHOWERS ALONG PALM 
BEACH AT THIS TIME...30 PCT POPS WOULD SEEM REASONABLE...BUT I WILL 
CARRY CONTINUITY OR 20 PCT AND NOT ZIG OVER TO 30 PCT POPS AGAIN. 
A LATE NIGHT UPDATE MAY BE IN ORDER. MEANWHILE...WINDS ARE EXPECTED
TO INCREASE FROM THE NE OVER A WIDE AREA SOUTH OF THE FIZZLING 
BOUNDARY. SEE MARINE SECTION.

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...A STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT 
SHOULD REMAIN ACROSS THE KEYS AREA THROUGH MONDAY EVENING...WITH
A GRADUAL DECREASE LATE MONDAY NIGHT AS THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA TO 
OUR NORTH MORPHS INTO AN EAST-WEST RIDGE, WEAKENS SOME, AND SHIFTS 
SOUTH OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. DURING THIS TIME FRAME...A 500 MB 
RIDGE IS FORECAST TO BUILD FROM THE CARIBBEAN AND SOUTHERN GULF OF 
MEXICO TOWARD THE KEYS...PROVIDING LIGHT SUBSIDING AIR OR AT LEAST
SHUNTING SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE ENERGY TO OUR NORTH. THE LATEST GFS 
MODEL NOW SHAKES LOOSE ITS IDEA OF CONTINUING DEEP MOISTURE...AND
PAINTS A DRYING TREND FOR LEVELS 850-700 MB OVER THE KEYS. 
20 PCT POPS WILL BE CARRIED FOR POSSIBLE SMALL LOW-TOPPED SHOWERS 
MOVING QUICKLY WEST OFF THE STRAITS AND OVER THE KEYS...BUT 10 PCT 
MIGHT WORK AS WELL.  NO CHANGE IN DAILY TEMPERATURES IS INDICATED. 

TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...A LIGHTER WIND FLOW AT THE SURFACE 
IS EXPECTED AS A WEAKER HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE SETTLES SOUTH OVER THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA. DRY AIR ALOFT IS STILL INDICATED. 

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...THE EXTENDED RANGE IS MUDDLED...DUE TO 
INDICATIONS OF ANOTHER COLD FRONT MOVING SE INTO THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...SOME INCREASE IN MOISTURE AHEAD OF IT PERHAPS NUDGING 
SOUTH TO THE KEYS...AND MAYBE SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY RIPPLING SOUTH 
TOWARD SOUTH FLORIDA. NO FIRM CHANGES WILL BE INDICATED AT THIS 
EARLY TIME. 
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS WERE TURNING TO NE LATE THIS AFTERNOON...AND WINDS ARE 
EXPECTED TO INCREASE IN SPEED INTO THE 15-20 KT RANGE OVER ALL KEYS 
WATERS DURING THE NIGHT. TIMING OF WIND INCREASE IS ILL-DEFINED 
BECAUSE THE BUILDING WINDS AND SEAS WILL SET IN AHEAD OF...AND NOT 
JUST ALONG AND BEHIND...A DISSIPATING FRONTAL BOUNDARY. SMALL CRAFT 
SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION TONIGHT FOR INCREASING WINDS AND SEAS. 

WINDS ARE NOW EXPECTED TO PERSIST AT 15-20 KT...OR PERHAPS EVEN AT 
20 KT...SUNDAY INTO MONDAY EVENING. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY MAY BE 
REQUIRED FOR ATLANTIC WATERS DUE TO SEAS BEYOND THE REEF SUNDAY INTO 
MONDAY EVENING...BUT MAY ALSO BE RAISED FOR WINDS WITH JUST A SMALL
BOOST OVER THE 15-20 KT RANGE. AT ANY RATE...ADVERSE CONDITIONS FOR 
THE OPERATION OF SMALL CRAFT ARE EXPECTED TO SET IN TONIGHT AND 
PERSIST AT LEAST INTO MONDAY EVENING. A GRADUAL DECREASE IN EAST 
WINDS TO NEAR 10 KT IS EXPECTED BY MID WEEK. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
TONIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED SMALL SHOWERS 
WILL PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE...BUT THESE 
WILL BE VERY FEW AND EASILY CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW

KBYX RADAR IS QUIET THIS MORNING AND IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THE 
THE LARGE AREA OF MID TO UPPER CLOUDS ARE REMAINING OVER THE EASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO AND CENTRAL FLORIDA...STAYING VERY THIN EVEN OVER OUR 
SOUTHERN MARINE ZONES. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 
80S ALONG THE ISLANDS WITH WINDS OUT OF THE NORTH AROUND 10 MPH. 
CMAN SITES ARE REGISTERING 10 KNOTS OR LESS.

MID TO UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN WEST TO SLIGHTLY NORTHWEST OVER 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS HEIGHTS SLOWLY RISE OVER THE CENTRAL 
PORTION OF THE GULF OF MEXICO. CLOSER TO THE SURFACE...AN AREA OF 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND FROM THE DEEP SOUTH OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN STATES. BY MONDAY...THIS HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE FURTHER 
EXPANDING FROM THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST TO THE NEW ENGLAND COAST WITH 
A SOUTHERN EXTENSION REACHING TOWARD THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. THERE 
ARE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGEWS IN FORECAST REASONING THAN ON PREVIOUS 
SHIFTS...EXCEPT FOR RAIN CHANCES LATER THIS WEEKEND AS THE STEERING 
FLOW TURNS AND INCREASES OUT OF THE NORTHEAST. THE LATEST GFS IS 
DEPICTING A DEEPER EXTENT OF MOISTURE DURING THIS TIME WHEREAS THE 
NAM IS SHOWING MUCH SHALLOWER MOISTURE AND NO INDICATION OF ENHANCED 
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SPEED INCREASE. AS SUCH...MOS NUMBERS FROM 
BOTH MODELS DIFFER FROM TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AS FAR AS POPS 
ARE CONCERNED. AFTER LOOKING AT GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY...BELIEVE THE 
NAM IS INITIATED MORE CLOSELY TO ACTUAL CONDITIONS OFF TO THE EAST 
AND NORTHEAST OF FLORIDA. THIS IS A DRIER REGION THAT WILL BE TAPPED 
AS THE STEERING FLOW TURNS TO THE NORTHEAST LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
THEN INCREASES DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. SO WILL CUT OUR POPS BACK 
FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY BY A SMALL AMOUNT. THIS WILL TAKE ALL 
PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREA INTO A SMALL CHANCE/ISOLATED RANGE. 
THERE IS VERY NICE AGREEMENT AMONG THE SHORT TERM MODELS AS FAR AS 
WIND SPEEDS ARE CONCERNED. NO ADJUSTMENTS ARE NECESSARY FOR ANY 
PORTION OF THE FORECAST. TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE IS ALSO IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT AND IS RIGHT IN LINE WITH WHAT WE HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING. 
NO CHANGES PLANNED THERE EITHER.

FOR THE EXTENDED PORTION OF THE FORECAST...FROM MONDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE PUSHED FURTHER OFF INTO THE ATLANTIC 
AND THE RIDGE ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN. EXPECT 
LIGHTER EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS...A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS...AND 
TEMPERATURES A COUPLE OF DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGE FOR ALL 
PERIODS.

CAUTIONARY CONDITIONS FOR MOST WATERS SURROUNDING THE KEYS FOR 
TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY NIGHT. THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY FOR 
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR LATE TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
340 AM EDT SAT OCT 14 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A FEW SMALL ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR WERE RECENTLY EVIDENT IN THE 
STRAITS...AND EXTENDED WESTWARD TO THE WATERS JUST SOUTH OF THE DRY 
TORTUGAS...ON A LOWER LEVEL SPEED CONVERGENT LINE. OTHERWISE...THIN 
ELEVATED CLOUDS THROUGH THE MID LEVELS ARE PULLING SOUTHEASTWARD 
ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA AT THIS HOUR. WINDS HAVE FRESHENED OUT OF 
THE NORTHEAST ALL AREA...AND ARE NOW AVERAGING NEAR 15 MPH ALONG THE 
ISLANDS. SPEEDS ARE CLOSE TO 18 KNOTS ON AVERAGE AT THE CMANS WITH 
GUSTS OF 22-25 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S ALONG THE 
ISLAND CHAIN.

.FORECAST...
FRESH NORTHEAST TO EAST BREEZES WILL CONTINUE TO BLOW AT LEAST 
THROUGH MONDAY. VERY GOOD AGREEMENT AMONG THE GFS AND NAM ON THAT 
ACCOUNT...BUT PLAN TO LEAVE A BREEZY DESCRIPTOR OUT OF THE FORECAST 
FOR THE ISLAND CHAIN WITH EXPECTED SPEEDS JUST BELOW THE CRITERIA. 
IN GENERAL...THERE IS NOT A SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN THE FORECAST 
REASONING THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST 
PACKAGES. BUT...THERE IS  A BIT OF A DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE NAM AND 
GFS WITH THE FLOW BETWEEN 5 AND 10 KFT AS EARLY AS TONIGHT. THE NAM 
REMAINS STEADY OUT OF THE NORTHEAST THROUGH THIS LAYER AND IS 
CONSISTENTLY DRIER...WHEREAS THE GFS VEERS ALL THE WAY AROUND TO THE 
NORTHWEST AND DRAWS MOISTURE BACK TOWARDS THE KEYS THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. BUT THE MOS RAIN CHANCES REMAIN CLOSE TO OR 
BELOW 20 PERCENT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE ENTIRE FORECAST. SO ASIDE 
FROM A FEW SMALL ADJUSTMENTS DOWNWARD IN THE POP GRIDS TONIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY...NO LARGE CHANGES ARE IN ORDER. MOS TEMPERATURES ARE 
ALSO VERY CLOSE. RIDGING THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND UPPER LEVELS...IN 
CONJUNCTION WITH AN EXTENSION OF HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE ATLANTIC AT 
THE SURFACE...WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES A COUPLE OF DEGREES ABOVE 
AVERAGE INTO THE LATE PORTION OF THE COMING WEEK. A WEAKENING COLD 
FRONT WILL DRAPE ACROSS FLORIDA BY NEXT WEEKEND. AT THIS TIME...IT 
STILL DOES NOT APPEAR TO CHANGE CONDITIONS SIGNIFICANTLY FOR OUR 
LATITUDE. WILL CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS THEN.

&&

.MARINE...
LATEST ANALYSIS IS INDICATING A LULL IN A NARROW STRIP ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL PORTION OF THE SERVICE AREA...ORIENTED NNE/SSW. BUT FRESH 
WINDS CAN BE SEEN UPSTREAM...AND EVEN HIGHER SPEEDS ARE OBSERVED TO 
THE WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM SHOW A STEADY NE/E 
FLOW IN ALL MARINE ZONES TODAY...AND TIGHTEN THE GRADIENT MORE 
ACROSS THE GULF ZONES THAN ON PREVIOUS RUNS. IT IS A TIGHT CALL TO 
RAISE A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FLAG FOR THE BAY AND GULF WATERS 
ESPECIALLY WITH SOME SHADOWING FROM THE MAINLAND...BUT FEEL 
CONFIDENT ENOUGH AT THIS POINT TO RAISE IT ON THIS PACKAGE. SO 
BOATERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF THAT HEADLINE ON ALL KEYS WATERS WHEN 
MAKING ANY PLANS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND. THE GRADIENT 
SHOULD RELAX ENOUGH TO ALLOW WINDS TO SLOWLY DECREASE LATE MONDAY 
EVENING...TO BE CLOSER TO 10 KNOTS FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. JUST A FEW SHOWERS WILL MOVE 
SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE FLIGHT ROUTE TODAY...WITH THE SLIGHT 
POSSIBILITY OF BRIEF MVFR CIGS OR VIS IN ANY QUICK SHOWERS. PILOTS 
WILL ENCOUNTER A 20 TO 45 DEGREE SUSTAINED CROSS WIND OF NEAR 15 
KNOTS AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS.

&&

.PRELIMINARY POINT TEMPS/POPS...
KEY WEST  86 78 86 78  /  20 10 10 10
MARATHON  87 78 87 78  /  20 10 10 10

WINDS ARE WEST TO NORTHWEST ACROSS THE AREA...5 TO 10 MPH ON LAND

DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE STRAITS...AND FEW IF ANY ECHOES 
ELSEWHERE. TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE MID 80S WITH DEWPOINTS 
IN THE LOW TO MID 70S UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
RISE ONLY A FEW MORE DEGREES THIS AFTERNOON. KEY WEST 12Z RAOB 
INDICATES THAT SOMEWHAT DRIER MID-LEVEL AIR HAS FILTERED INTO THE 
AREA OVERNIGHT...BUT PWAT REMAINS HIGH AT 2.05 INCHES DUE TO AMPLE 
LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE.

.SHORT TERM (THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT)...
A SURFACE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES WILL 
MOVE EASTWARD TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN 
STATES BY TOMORROW. IN THE MEANTIME...A VERY WEAK LOW-LEVEL PRESSURE 
PATTERN WILL AFFECT OUR AREA...RESULTING IN LIGHT GENERALLY 
NORTHWEST WINDS THIS AFTERNOON...BECOMING NORTH AND THEN NORTHEAST 
SATURDAY MORNING. THE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE ON THE 12Z KEY 
WEST RAOB INDICATES A SOMEWHAT DRY AND STABLE LAYER BETWEEN ABOUT 
600 MB AND 700 MB. HOWEVER...LOW-LEVEL (BELOW 10 KFT/700 MB) 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY REMAIN HIGH AND WEAK LOW-LEVEL WINDS SHOULD 
PROMOTE SOME CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT. AT LEAST ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE AREA TODAY...AND CLOUD LINES COULD 
PRODUCE SCATTERED COVERAGE IN SOME AREAS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS. THUS WILL MAINTAIN LOW CHANCE POPS TODAY. IN THE 
LIGHT NORTH TO NORTHEASTERLY FLOW AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH 
TONIGHT...SOME DRY AIR MOVING DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA SHOULD 
ENTER OUR AREA...THUS RESULTING IN LOWER POPS TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. 
CURRENT FORECAST PACKAGE HANDLES THIS WELL...AND NO CHANGES ARE 
ANTICIPATED AT MORNING ISSUANCE.

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE WEST TO NORTHWEST SURFACE WINDS WILL PREVAIL ON ALL KEYS 
WATERS THIS AFTERNOON. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ARE

WEST RAOB INDICATES A SOMEWHAT DRY AND STABLE LAYER BETWEEN ABOUT 
600 MB AND 700 MB. HOWEVER...LOW-LEVEL (BELOW 10 KFT/700 MB) 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY REMAIN HIGH AND WEAK LOW-LEVEL WINDS SHOULD 
PROMOTE SOME CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT. AT LEAST ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE AREA TODAY...AND CLOUD LINES COULD 
PRODUCE SCATTERED COVERAGE IN SOME AREAS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS. THUS WILL MAINTAIN LOW CHANCE POPS TODAY. IN THE 
LIGHT NORTH TO NORTHEASTERLY FLOW AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH 
TONIGHT...SOME DRY AIR MOVING DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA SHOULD 
ENTER OUR AREA...THUS RESULTING IN LOWER POPS TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. 
CURRENT FORECAST PACKAGE HANDLES THIS WELL...AND NO CHANGES ARE 
ANTICIPATED AT MORNING ISSUANCE.

GENTLE WEST TO NORTHWEST SURFACE WINDS WILL PREVAIL ON ALL KEYS

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR THIS MORNING. A WEAK PRESSURE 
PATTERN HAS ALLOWED WINDS TO REMAIN LIGHT...AND ARE FAVORING THE 
WESTERLY DIRECTION AT THE CMAN SITES EARLY THIS MORNING. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN WITH A 
ILL-DEFINED LINE OF MID LEVEL CLOUDS STRETCHING FROM THE DRY 
TORTUGAS TO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS AND THEN FURTHER OUT INTO THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS.

.FORECAST...
THE LOCAL AREA WILL REMAIN UNDER A DEEP WESTERLY FLOW OVER THE NEXT 
DAY OR SO. CLOSER TO THE SURFACE...A WEAK PATTERN CHARACTERIZED BY 
HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR SOUTH WILL ALLOW THE LIGHT TO GENTLE WINDS TO 
TURN MORE TO THE NORTHWEST AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. THE MOST RECENT 
GFS IS INDICATING LITTLE IF ANY MID TO UPPER LEVEL ENERGY TRAVERSING 
THE LOCAL AREA TODAY AS THE UPPER LOW NEAR THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES 
BEGINS TO LIFT OUT TO THE NORTHEAST. AS A RESULT...THE GFS MOS POP 
NUMBERS ARE ALL IN THE SINGLE DIGITS ALL THE WAY INTO SUNDAY. THE 
NAM NUMBERS ARE IN THE SMALL CHANCE TODAY...PROBABLY PICKING UP ON A 
SUBTLE SHORTWAVE EJECTING FROM THE WEST/CENTRAL PORTION OF THE 
GULF. BELIEVE WITH THE WIND FIELD AND AVAILABLE MOISTURE...ALONG 
WITH CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY WE STAND AT LEAST A CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO BY THE AFTERNOON. SO THE MORNING 
FORECAST WILL DEVIATE LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS ISSUANCE...AND STICK 
CLOSER TO THE NAM NUMBERS AT LEAST IN THE SHORT TERM. AS HIGH 
PRESSURE EXPANDS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES...AND VEERING WIND 
PROFILE WILL USHER IN SOME DRIER AIR INTO SOUTH FLORIDA BY TONIGHT. 
AGAIN...GFS SHOWS A SUBSTANTIAL INTRUSION OF DRY AIR INTO THE LOWEST 
LAYERS OF THE TROPOSPHERE. WILL HANG ON TO A SMALL MENTION OF 
SHOWERS FOR BOTH TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...BUT BRING THEM BACK UP TO A 
CHANCE SATURDAY NIGHT AS STRONGER NORTHEAST FLOW BECOMES ESTABLISHED.
FROM SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...THE WEATHER 
PICTURE WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXPANDING 
EAST/NORTHEASTWARD OFF OF THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST WITH ITS AXIS 
EXTENDING TOWARDS FLORIDA...AND HEIGHT RISES THROUGH THE MID AND 
UPPER LEVELS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. WILL STICK CLOSE TO THE EXTENDED 
GFS NUMBERS AS FAR AS RAIN CHANCES AND TEMPERATURES ARE CONCERNED. 
EXPECT ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND TEMPERATURES A COUPLE OF 
DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGE FOR EACH PERIOD. A WEAKENING FRONT 
WILL SAG INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA LATER NEXT WEEK THANKS TO A TROUGH 
RIDING OFF THE EAST COAST...BUT THIS SHOULD NOT HAVE MUCH OF AN 
EFFECT AT OUR LATITUDE.

&&

.MARINE...
BOATERS CAN EXPECT A SLOW TURNING OF THE WINDS FROM WEST/NORTHWEST 
TODAY...NORTHERLY TONIGHT...NORTHEAST ON SATURDAY. FRESHENING 
NORTHEAST TO EAST BREEZES FOR SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY 
NIGHT BRINGS A FAIR CHANCE OF SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS FOR 
THOSE PERIODS. AS STATED ON PREVIOUS SHIFTS...THOSE CONDITIONS MAY 
PERSIST IN MONDAY AS WELL...AND THEN THE ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS SHOULD 
ALLOW WINDS TO SLACKEN BELOW ADVISORY CONDITIONS THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
OF THE WEEK.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AND AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. THROUGH 12Z...PATCHY FOG 
MAY PRODUCE AREAS OF MVFR CIGS AND/OR VIS...MAINLY NEAR THE 
EVERGLADES. AFTER 18Z...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
POSSIBLE OVER THE ROUTE DURING THE AFTERNOON...BUT WILL REMAIN 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. IN ADDITION...A FEW WIND GUSTS TO 30 KNOTS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE WITHIN ANY HEAVY SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS. SURFACE WINDS AT

WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A SUBTLE MID TO UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
2 AM (06Z) BUOY AND SHIP REPORTS AROUND THE REGION SUGGEST THAT A 
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS WAS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
BAHAMAS TO WESTERN CUBA. KEYS AREA WINDS ARE RESPONDING BY TURNING 
TO SW-W...BUT SPEEDS REMAIN LIGHT...NEAR 5 KT AWAY FROM SHOWERS. 
THOSE SHOWERS...AND EVEN AN OCCASIONAL CB WITH POSSIBLE LIGHTNING...
HAVE BEEN MOVING EAST OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS...AND SEVERAL MOVED 
OVER LOWER KEYS LOCATIONS AS WELL AFTER MIDNIGHT. AT THIS TIME...
OTHER SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS HAVE APPEARED ON KEY WEST 
DOPPLER LONG RANGE...IN THE SE GULF OF MEXICO DUE WEST OF DRY 
TORTUGAS. PATCHES OF MID CLOUD ARE DRIFTING OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS.
IR SATELLITE DEPICTS AN IRREGULAR ILL-DEFINED BAND OF MULTILEVEL 
CLOUDS STRETCHING EAST FROM THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...
TO OVER THE KEYS...THENCE TOWARD THE NORTHWEST BAHAMAS. WITHIN THIS 
BAND OF CLOUDS IS WHERE EARLIER...AND CURRENT...SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEEN OCCURRING. I CANT SEE ANY WELL-DEFINED 
EVIDENCE OF UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE ENERGY OVER THE KEYS REGION OR 
IMMEDIATELY UPSTREAM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO...JUST SOME ELEMENTS OF 
FAST FLYING CIRRUS COMING IN FROM THE W OR WNW. THE ATMOSPHERE 
REMAINS MOIST AROUND THE KEYS. SURFACE DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE MID 
70S. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...AGAIN...ALL MODELS INDICATE A RELATIVELY 
STRONG ZONAL UPPER LEVEL FLOW OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS...WITHOUT ANY 
WELL DEFINED SHORT WAVE TROUGHS. HIGH LEVEL FLOW IN FACT IS FORECAST 
TO BE VERY STRONG NORTH OF THE KEYS...COVERING THE ENTIRE EASTERN 
U.S. ...WITH A RELATIVELY WIDE BAND OF 100 KT PLUS WINDS AT 250 MB 
FROM NORTH FLORIDA ALL THE WAY TO INDIANA. THE IMPACT OF THIS ON THE 
LOCAL AREA IS PERHAPS TO OBSCURE ANY VERY FAST-MOVING SHORT WAVE 
TROUGHS AND ASSOCIATED ENERGY. MEANWHILE...OPERATIONAL MODELS ALL
POINT TO CONTINUED HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 12 
THSD FT OVER THE KEYS DURING THIS PERIOD. STABILITY INDEX VALUES ON 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS FOR THE KEYS REMAIN UNSTABLE...K-INDEX 35-39...
LIFTED INDEX MINUS 3 TO MINUS 6. WITH CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES 
CALCULATED IN THE MID 80S...AND LITTLE IF ANY CONVECTIVE 
INHIBITION...THEN GIVEN FAVORABLE OR EVEN SLIGHTLY FAVORABLE LOW 
LEVEL WIND DIRECTIONS...AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND EVEN THUNDERSTORMS
OUGHT TO BE ABLE TO FORM OVER OR JUST OFF KEYS ISLANDS. ONE DRAWBACK 
MAY BE THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER THAT COULD HOLD DOWN INSOLATION. 
NONETHELESS...WITH GFS AND NAM OUTPUT BOTH GIVING 40-50 PCT POPS FOR 
TODAY...I WILL AT LEAST INDICATE 40 PCT IN THE ZONE FORECASTS...WITH
MENTION OF THUNDER. 30 PCT POPS FOR TONIGHT (AGAIN WITH THUNDER)
AND 30 PCT FOR FRI WILL BE RETAINED. SURFACE WINDS ARE NOW EXPECTED 
TO BE SW-W TODAY WITH A BIT OF SPEED INCREASE TO 10 KT...PERHAPS 
W A BIT LIGHTER TONIGHT...THEN GOING NW ON FRIDAY AS LOW PRESSURE 
ALONG A FRONT PASSES WELL TO OUR NORTH.

FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...BOTH GFS AND NAM MODELS SHOW 
SIGNIFICANTLY DRIER AIR ALOFT MOVING SOUTH OVER THE KEYS...EVEN INTO 
THE LAYER JUST BELOW 5 THSD FT. A WEAK N TO NE WIND FLOW THAT SETS 
IN IS A RESULT OF A WEAK PRESSURE CONFIGURATION SOUTH OF A COLD 
FRONT THAT WILL ENTER NORTH FLORIDA DURING THIS PERIOD. LOW POPS OF 
20 PCT ARE WARRANTED. 

SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...WHILE THE BAROCLINIC ZONE ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE FRONT REMAINS NORTH OF THE KEYS...AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
EXPANDING OVER THE EASTERN STATES TO FLORIDA IS SHOWN TO CREATE
PRESSURE RISES SOUTH OF THE DYING FRONT...BRINGING AN ONSET OF 
NE BREEZES TO THE KEYS. A SURGE OF LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE (SURFACE UP 
TO 850 MB) IS SHOWN BY THE GFS. THIS MAY ENHANCE LOW-TOPPED SHOWERS
SO I WILL RETAIN THE ONGOING 30 PCT POPS. 

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...BREEZY CONDITIONS ARE INDICATED DUE 
TO HIGH PRESSURE ON THROUGH TUESDAY...THEN LESSENING WINDS BY 
WEDNESDAY. SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR ALOFT IS ALSO INDICATED...BUT NOT MUCH 
IN THE WAY OF ANY COOLING FOR THE KEYS. IN FACT...MODEL OUTPUT 
STATISTICS KEEP DAILY TEMPS A LITTLE ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THE KEYS. 
&&

.MARINE...
SW TO W WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO NEAR 10 KT TODAY...THEN
GO WEST IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE TONIGHT...W-NW 10 KT FRIDAY. WATCH FOR 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THIS PERIOD. A TURN OF WINDS TO N 
THEN NE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY IS NOT AN ACTUAL FRONTAL PASSAGE...
BUT RATHER A REFLECTION OF A WEAK TROUGH PASSING. STRONG AND LARGE 
HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO EXPAND SOUTH OVER FLORIDA SATURDAY 
NIGHT...AND THIS WILL BRING NE WINDS UP TO 15 KT AND GUSTY OVER THE 
KEYS...AND MAYBE EVEN A BIT HIGHER. ITS POSSIBLE THAT CAUTIONARY 
HEADLINES MAY BE REQUIRED FOR KEYS COASTAL WATERS DUE TO THE NE 
BREEZES SOMETIME DURING THE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT 
PERIOD. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY 
WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME LIKELY 
ON THE MAINLAND THIS AFTERNOON. COVERAGE SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED 
ALONG THE ROUTE. CELL MOVEMENT WILL BE APPROX 30015KT AND WILL TEND

THE KEY WEST EVENING UPPER-AIR SOUNDING REVEALED VERY MOIST 
CONDITIONS FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 10000FT AGL...ALONG WITH A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE STRATIFICATION...MLCAPE OF ABOUT 1500 J/KG... 
AND LITTLE OR NO CONVECTIVE INHIBITION. IN ADDITION...MODERATELY 
STRONG WIND SPEEDS IN THE UPPER AND MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE WERE 
CONTRIBUTING TO  A 0-6KM BULK WIND SHEAR OF ABOUT 30KT. LOCALLY 
ENHANCED LOW-LEVEL SHEAR ALONG A QUASI-STATIONARY EAST-WEST BOUNDARY 
PROVIDED JUST ENOUGH DEEP LAYER SHEAR FOR SOME ROTATING CONVECTIVE 
CELLS EARLIER THIS EVENING...ALTHOUGH A COMBINATION OF DISCRETE... 
LINEAR...AND MULTICELL STRUCTURES HAS BEEN OBSERVED OVER THE LAST 
SIX HOURS. LATEST RADAR SCANS SHOW A FEW DEEP CONVECTIVE CELLS OVER 
THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA JUST BEYOND THE REEF...ALONG WITH SCATTERED 
SHOWERS...ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS...AND AREAS OF MODERATE RAIN ACROSS 
WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREA...IN THE VICINITY OF THE DRY 
TORTUGAS AND OVER WATERS WEST AND SOUTH OF THE DRY TORTUGAS. 
MARITIME TROPICAL AIR RESIDES OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS...WITH AIR 
TEMPERATURES IN MOST ISLAND COMMUNITIES NEAR 80F...AND DEWPOINTS IN 
THE MID 70S. WINDS AT THE SURFACE HAVE BEEN VARIABLE IN DIRECTION... 
LIGHT IN SPEED...AND SIGNIFICANTLY INFLUENCED BY CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW. 

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS EVENING SHOWS MODERATE 
WESTERLIES IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER TROPOSPHERE OVER MOST OF THE GULF 
BASIN AND FLORIDA PENINSULA. IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...A FAIRLY 
STRONG MOISTURE/BUOYANCY GRADIENT WAS ANALYZED ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. IN ADDITION...A VERY WEAK 
CONFLUENT ZONE WAS ANALYZED IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER FROM THE STRAITS 
OF FLORIDA TO SOUTH-CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. RADAR TRENDS HAVE 
INDICATED ENHANCED CONVECTION WITHIN THE MOIST...CONDITIONALLY 
UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT COINCIDENT WITH THE WEAK LOW-LEVEL CONFLUENT 
ZONE.

ALTHOUGH MOST CONVECTION HAS SHIFTED SOUTH OF THE ISLANDS FOR THE 
TIME BEING...ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS OBSERVED UPSTREAM. THE 
SYNOPTIC SETUP SHOULD CHANGE LITTLE OVERNIGHT...AND A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE RETAINED FOR THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD.
&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT AND VARIABLE BREEZES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AT MOST MARINE SITES 
OVER THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS. HOWEVER...A SURFACE TROUGH MIGRATING 
EAST ACROSS THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO AND NORTHERN FLORIDA SHOULD 
TURN WINDS TO LIGHT SOUTHWEST AFTER MIDNIGHT. A TRANSITION WILL BE 
INDICATED IN EVENING UPDATE.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS 
WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 12Z. ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR OVER THE KEYS PORTION OF THE FLIGHT 
ROUTE (60SW KMIA-KEYW) OVERNIGHT...PRODUCING BRIEF PERIODS OF MVFR 
TO IFR CIGS AND/OR VIS...AND GUSTY WINDS AROUND 30 KNOTS. SURFACE 
WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION AND 
BOUNDARIES.

.DISCUSSION...
UNLIKE LAST NIGHT...A QUITE OVERNIGHT OCCURRED WHICH CONSISTED OF 
ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THE OUTER WATERS SOUTH OF 
THE ISLAND CHAIN. BECAUSE OF LIGHT WINDS...TEMPERATURES FELL INTO 
THE MID 70S ACROSS MOST OF THE ISLAND CHAIN.
 
CURRENTLY...
SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS OUR REGION IS BETWEEN A TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE OVER NORTH FLORIDA WITH AN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE NEARBY. 
EARLY GOES-12 VISIBLE SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW A SNAKE LIKE  
BOUNDARY LYING ACROSS THE OUTER STRAITS SOUTH OF THE FLORIDA 
KEYS...AND REACHING INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. ALTHOUGH THE 
PORTION OF THE BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE KEYS IS RELATIVELY 
INACTIVE...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PERSIST IN THE SOUTHEAST GULF 
OF MEXICO. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS 
INDICATE VARIABLE WINDS OF LESS THAN 5 KNOTS EXCEPT MOSTLY WEST AT 5 
TO 10 KNOTS ON THE NORTHERN WATERS. MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE 
DETECTING ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE DISTANT WATERS BEYOND 20 MILES 
SOUTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN. OTHERWISE...OUR MORNING SOUNDING REVEALS 
A CONDITIONAL STABLE AND TYPICAL MOIST (PWAT 1.91 INCHES) WITH A 
MODERATE SOUTHWEST TO WEST FLOW REACHING UP TO 600 MB...BEFORE A 
STRENGTHENING NORTHWEST FLOW TAKES OVER.

FORECAST (BALANCE OF TODAY)...WITH AMPLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN 
PLACE...THE AFOREMENTIONED LOWER TROPOSPHERIC SOUTHWEST TO WEST FLOW 
MAY BE FAVORABLE FOR CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT ALONG PORTIONS OF THE 
ISLAND CHAIN. HOWEVER...BELIEVE UPDRAFTS WILL HAVE AN ARDUOUS TIME 
OVERCOMING MODERATE SOUTHWEST TO WEST SHEAR. FURTHERMORE...AN 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER DUE TO WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT MAY LIMIT CLOUD 
LINE FORMATION. OTHERWISE...IT APPEARS WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT COMBINED 
WITH UPPER LEVEL MASS DIFFLUENCE IS ENHANCING DEEP AND WET 
CONVECTION ALONG THE WESTERN PART OF THE BOUNDARY. ALTHOUGH ...BOTH 
GFS AND NAM INDICATE ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE ALONG THE 305 K SURFACE WILL 
CEASE BY AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURE WISE...A LIGHT WESTERLY FLOW SHOULD 
ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB INTO THE MID AND UPPER 80S. 
THEREFORE...WILL MONITOR CLOUD COVER AND CONVECTIVE TRENDS FOR A 
POSSIBLE UPDATE TO THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST.  

&&

.MARINE...
WITH THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE NOSING JUST SOUTH OF OUR 
REGION...LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS SHOULD BECOME MOSTLY WESTERLY AT 
10 KNOTS OR LESS.  

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AND AT THE KEYS TERMINALS. ONLY FEW SHOWERS ARE ANTICIPATED

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
430 AM EDT WED OCT 11 2006

.DISCUSSION...
NOW THAT WE ARE OUT OF SATELLITE ECLIPSE...THE PAST FEW IR SATELLITE 
IMAGES FROM GOES-EAST SHOW A LONG AND THIN LINE OF LOW CLOUDS 
(PROBABLY CU AND TCU AND MAYBE A FEW CBS) EXTENDING FROM THE 
ATLANTIC WELL NE OF THE BAHAMAS...THENCE SW OVER THE NORTHERN 
BAHAMAS TO THE SOUTHERN STRAITS OF FLORIDA PARALLELING THE KEYS SOME 
50 NM TO OUR SE AND S...AND CONTINUING INTO THE SE GULF OF MEXICO.
THIS CLOUD LINE MARKS THE STALLING POINT OF THE WEAK TROUGH THAT 
FINALLY EASED E AND S OF THE KEYS YESTERDAY MORNING. NEWLY-DEVELOPED 
SHOWERS ARE SEEN ON DOPPLER RADAR ALONG THE LINE THROUGH THE 
STRAITS...WITH MAX TOP SO FAR UP TO 28 THSD FT. MEANWHILE...A WEAK 
SURFACE RIDGE SEEMS LIE OVER THE SE GULF OF MEXICO POKING E OR SE TO 
DRY TORTUGAS AND THE LOWER KEYS. WINDS ARE LIGHT AND VARIABLE OVER 
MOST OF THE KEYS REGION ACCORDING TO C-MAN, ISLAND GAUGES, AND A 
SHIP REPORT. HOWEVER, NORTHERN EDGES OF THE AREA INCLUDING THE UPPER 
KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS ARE SHOWING A STEADY BUT LIGHT (LESS THAN 
10 KT) WEST WIND FLOW DUE TO LOWER PRESSURES OFF THE SE U.S. COAST. 
GOES SOUNDER DATA VERIFY AN AIRMASS WITH 1.8 INCH OF PRECIPITABLE 
WATER OVER THE KEYS AND AREAS TO OUR EAST AND WEST...WHILE MUCH 
DRIER AIR IS IN PLACE NOT FAR TO OUR NORTH OVER THE SOUTHERN FLORIDA 
PENINSULA. CURRENT AIRMASS OVER THE KEYS IS THEREFORE LIKELY STILL 
SIMILAR TO LAST EVENINGS SOUNDING AT KEY WEST...SHOWING MOIST AND 
CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE AIR FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 12 THSD FT...
WITH DRY AIR ABOVE THAT. TEMPS ARE IN THE MID 70S AT ISLAND 
SITES...WHILE SURFACE DEWPOINT TEMPS REMAIN IN THE LOWER 70S. 

.FORECAST...
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW INCONSISTENCIES DURING THE NEAR TERM...
GENERALLY FROM TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY...DUE TO DIFFERING 
CONFIGURATIONS OF WINDS WITHIN A WEAK SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN 
AROUND THE KEYS...AND ALSO DUE TO DIFFERING SOLUTIONS FOR 
ALTERNATING SWATHS OF HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT VERSUS DRY AIR ALOFT 
OVER THE KEYS. INTERESTINGLY...IN THE LONGER TERM FROM ABOUT 
SATURDAY NIGHT ONWARD...MODELS HAVE BEEN MORE CONSISTENT WITH 
INDICATIONS OF LARGE HIGH PRESSURE SETTING IN OVER THE U.S. ATLANTIC 
COAST TO FLORIDA...THEREBY PROVIDING AN UPCOMING BREEZY...BUT STILL 
WARM...PERIOD FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEARER PERIODS...I HAVE RESISTED 
MAKING CHANGES TO ONGOING FORECASTS AT THIS TIME. 

TODAY...THE WEAK SURFACE TROUGH IN THE SOUTHERN STRAITS SHOULD 
DISSIPATE TODAY AS A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE GRADUALLY BECOMES 
ESTABLISHED JUST SOUTH OF THE KEYS. WHILE WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE ON THE WHOLE...WINDS MAY TEND TO SHOW A BIT OF FAVORED 
WESTERLY DIRECTION...ESPECIALLY OVER THE UPPER AND MID KEYS. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT PLENTIFUL MOISTURE IN THE LOWER 10 THSD 
FT SHOULD REMAIN IN PLACE. IF LOW LEVEL WINDS ARE LIGHT...THEN 
AFTERNOON TCU FORMATION MAY BE SEEN OVER OR NEAR ISLANDS...GIVEN THE 
CURRENT MOISTURE AVAILABLE. I WILL KEEP TODAYS CHANCE OF RAIN AT 20 
PCT FOR NOW SINCE THERE MAY BE A SLIGHT WEST WIND FLOW...BUT MOS 
GUIDANCE OF ALL MODELS IS IN THE 20-30 PCT RANGE. IN ADDITION... 
ISOLATED CBS ARE POSSIBLE WITH THE PROPER WIND PATTERN GIVEN 
STABILITY INDEX VALUES OF K=34 AND LI=MINUS 3. MENTION OF THUNDER 
MAY HAVE TO BE ADDED FOR THE AFTERNOON...IF THE MORNING SOUNDING 
REVEALS CONTINUED DEEP-ENOUGH MOISTURE. 

TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...A HUGE UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE IS STILL 
FORECAST TO SWING OVER SE CANADA NEAR THE GREAT LAKES...WHILE HIGH 
PRESSURE ALOFT IS OVER THE SOUTHERN GULF AND NW CARIBBEAN. THIS 
LARGE SCALE UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL SET UP STRONG ZONAL WINDS 
ALOFT OVER THE NORTHERN GULF AND FLORIDA. IT IS VERY DIFFICULT TO
IDENTIFY ANY BONAFIDE SHORT WAVE TROUGHS WITHIN THIS FLOW. AT THE 
SAME TIME...A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN AT THE SURFACE IS SHOWN BY ALL 
MODELS TO REMAIN NEAR THE KEYS...ALTHOUGH LIGHT WINDS MAY FAVOR A
SW TO W DIRECTION PART OF THIS TIME. NO SIGNIFICANT SHOWER-TRIGGERS 
ARE SEEN OTHER THAN DAYTIME HEATING OVER KEYS ISLANDS. 20 PCT POPS 
WILL BE CARRIED FOR EACH PERIOD ALTHOUGH AFTERNOONS MAY BE FAVORED. 

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUN NOW HAS A WEAKER 
TROUGH TO OUR NORTH ASSOCIATED WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING SLOWLY INTO 
FLORIDA...AND THEREFORE DOES NOT PICK UP W TO NW WINDS AS MUCH 
DURING FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. ALSO...THE GFS HAS A SWATH OF DRY 
AIR ALOFT SWEEPING EAST OVER THE KEYS FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
(STILL MOIST DURING THE DAY FRIDAY). HOWEVER...THE WRF MODEL 
PERSISTS WITH HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT SURFACE UP TO 700 MB AT LEAST 
FOR FRI AND FRI NIGHT. I WILL AVOID CHANGES WITH THIS FORECAST 
PACKAGE...TO SEE TRENDS WITH UPCOMING MODEL RUNS...AND MAINTAIN THE 
ONGOING 30 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR EACH PERIOD. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...AS DISCUSSED ABOVE...THE EXTENDED 
MODELS AT LEAST ARE CONSISTENT WITH HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH 
BUILDING SOUTH OVER THE DISSIPATING FRONTAL BOUNDARY...CAUSING NE TO 
E LOW LEVEL WINDS TO INCREASE OVER THE KEYS. NO COOLING OR DRYING AT 
THE SURFACE IS SEEN FOR THE KEYS...BUT EVENTUALLY FROM TUESDAY ONWARD
SOME DRYING ALOFT IS INDICATED. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IS 
WARRANTED FOR MUCH OF THIS TIME FRAME. 

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN SHOULD KEEP WIND SPEEDS IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE 
OVER KEYS WATERS THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...AND MAYBE INTO FRIDAY AS 
WELL. WHILE DIRECTION MAY BE VARIABLE FOR SOME WATERS...ITS 
BEGINNING TO LOOK LIKE THE LIGHT WINDS MAY FAVOR A WEST DIRECTION 
THIS AFTERNOON...AND SW TO W TONIGHT AND THU. FRIDAY IS A QUESTION 
MARK. WINDS MAY PICK UP FROM THE W TO NW LATE IN THE DAY OR FRI 
NIGHT...TO NEAR 10 KT. AT ANY RATE...LARGE AND STRONG HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE U.S. ATLANTIC COAST IS STILL IN THE OUTLOOK FOR LATE THIS 
WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK...WHICH WILL BRING MODERATE NE TO E BREEZES 
TO THE KEYS AT THAT TIME.

.DISCUSSION...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN HAS SET IN ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
ADJOINING WATERS...RENDERING LIGHT BREEZES ACROSS MOST OF THE 
SERVICE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS 
SHOW A DEEP CYCLONE MOVING EAST ACROSS THE ATLANTIC OFFSHORE THE 
CAROLINAS...WITH ANOTHER SMALLER CYCLONE AND SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
MOVING EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. UPPER-AIR DATA REVEAL A 
SHORT WAVE RIDGE BETWEEN THE TWO CYCLONES...OVER THE GULF BASIN AND 
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. CURRENT DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW ZERO 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA.

A LARGE...DEEP...AND COLD VORTEX IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER 
SOUTHERN CANADA AND THE NORTHERN UNITED STATES DURING THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS. HOWEVER...ZONAL UPPER FLOW IS LIKELY TO PREVAIL ACROSS 
THE LATITUDE OF THE KEYS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...BEFORE A SUBTROPICAL 
RIDGE BUILDS EARLY NEXT WEEK. IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...THE 
SITUATION IS A LITTLE TRICKIER. A VERY WEAK SFC-850MB RIDGE WILL 
LIKELY OSCILLATE OVER OR NEAR THE KEYS TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
BEFORE STRENGTHENING NORTHERLY FLOW ENVELOPES THE REGION OVER THE 
WEEKEND. AT THE SAME TIME...A WEAKLY TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
STRATIFICATION IS EXPECTED WITH WEAK CONVECTIVE INHIBITION ALONG 
WITH MOIST CONDITIONS AT THE SURFACE. LINGERING BOUNDARIES OF 
VARYING SCALES MAY ACTIVATE SHOWERS OR PERHAPS A THUNDERSTORM OR 
TWO...ESPECIALLY IF LOW-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE SOUTHERLY. AT THIS 
POINT...12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES WILL BE KEPT IN THE SLIGHT CATEGORY 
WITH NO THUNDER...BUT FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS NOT ESPECIALLY HIGH. 

THE DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION OF A HUGE AND INTENSE SURFACE CYCLONE 
IN THE VICINITY OF THE GREAT LAKES LATER THIS WEEK WILL INITIALLY 
DRAW A LARGE POOL OF CONTINENTAL POLAR AIR RAPIDLY EQUATORWARD 
BEHIND A COLD FRONT. HOWEVER...THE LACK OF UPPER SUPPORT...AND WARM 
AUTUMN SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL RESULT IN BOTH RAPID 
FRONTOLYSIS AND BOUNDARY LAYER AIR MASS MODIFICATION BEFORE SOMEWHAT 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR FINALLY MAKES IT TO THE KEYS BY PERHAPS 
SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY. NCEP GLOBAL MODEL ENSEMBLES STILL INDICATE 
SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS SCENARIO...BUT NOT NEAR AS MUCH AS IN 
PREVIOUS FORECAST CYCLES. ANY COOL-OFF WILL BE SHORT-LIVED AS 
ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGING BUILDS BENEATH A WARM ANTICYCLONE ALOFT 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...AND FRESHENING NORTHEAST OR EAST BREEZES OFF THE 
WARM ATLANTIC MODIFY CONTINENTAL AIR TRAJECTORIES INTO THE KEYS. 
THERE IS A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS FRIDAY THROUGH 
SATURDAY...ASSOCIATED WITH THE APPROACHING FRONT AND POSSIBLY 
INCREASED BOUNDARY LAYER CONVERGENCE. LACK OF DEEP ASCENT AND 
MID-LEVEL COOLING SHOULD KEEP THUNDER CHANCES LOW...ALTHOUGH 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS MAY NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE FORECAST IN 
FUTURE CYCLES...DEPENDING ON HOW TROPICAL THE LOCAL BOUNDARY LAYER 
IS AT TIME OF FRONTAL PASSAGE.
&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT AND VARIABLE BREEZES ARE EXPECTED WITH THE WEAK PRESSURE 
PATTERN THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY NIGHT. SOME KIND OF TRANSITION 
WILL THEN OCCUR FROM FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY AS CONTINENTAL AIR 
TRAJECTORIES TAKE OVER...WITH WINDS TURNING NORTHEAST BY SATURDAY.

DURING THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD...A SUBTLE MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
DISTURBANCE LIFTED A SNAKE LIKE SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS NORTHWARD ACROSS THE UPPER KEYS. THE COMBINATION OF THE LOW 
LEVEL CONFLUENCE AND DYNAMIC LIFT RESULTED IN MOST OF THE ISLAND 
CHAIN RECEIVING MEASURABLE RAINFALL AMOUNTS...WITH THE UPPER KEYS 
RECEIVING IN EXCESS OF 2 INCHES IN A FEW LOCATIONS. OTHERWISE...OUR 
MORNING SOUNDING REVEALS A FAIRLY MOIST (PWAT 1.89 INCHES) BUT WITH 
A COUPLE OF STABLE LAYERS BETWEEN 975 AND 890 MB...AS WELL AS 650 TO 
600 MB. IN ADDITION...A WELL PRONOUNCED UNIDIRECTIONAL NORTHWEST 
FLOW EXIST ABOVE 600 MB WHICH DENOTES THE PASSAGE OF THE 
AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH.
 
CURRENTLY....GOES-12 WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE DEPARTING WEAK 
MID AND UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE NORTHWEST BAHAMAS.   
SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A SURFACE TROUGH LYING ACROSS THE OUTER 
WATERS SOUTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN...WITH LIGHT NORTH WINDS COVERING 
MOST OF OUR AREA. DESPITE THE LIGHT NORTHERLY TRAJECTORY...MUCH 
DRIER AIR (DEWPOINTS NEAR 60 DEGREES) IS LAGGING BACK IN SOUTH 
CENTRAL FLORIDA. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION 
PLATFORMS AND SHIP REPORTS INDICATE NORTH WINDS OF NEAR 10 
KNOTS...EXCEPT SOUTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS OVER THE OUTER STRAITS. 
LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH OVER THE DISTANT WATERS 40 TO 60 MILES 
SOUTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

FORECAST (BALANCE OF TODAY)...WITH THE LOW LEVEL CONFLUENCE BOUNDARY 
DISSIPATING OVER THE OUTER STRAITS...SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR COMBINED 
WITH LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE FOLLOWING THE EXITING MID AND UPPER 
LEVEL PERTURBATION SHOULD PRECLUDE ANY SIGNIFICANT DEEP AND WET 
CONVECTION. LIGHT NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES 
IN THE MID 80S. SINCE FORECAST ELEMENTS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK...NO

WITH THE TROUGH OVER THE STRAITS BECOMING DIFFUSE THIS AFTERNOON AND

A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH AS OF 2 AM WAS ANALYZED EXTENDING WSW OVER THE 
NORTHERN BAHAMAS...TO THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...THENCE BENDING SOUTH OVER FLORIDA BAY TO THE LOWER KEYS. 
THE TROUGH SEEMS TO HAVE BUCKLED BACK WEST FROM ITS POSITION LATE IN 
THE DAY MONDAY. THIS PATTERN WAS GIVING LIGHT NW-N WINDS ON THE WEST 
SIDE OF THE TROUGH...SW WINDS 5-10 KT OVER THE UPPER KEYS AND OTHER 
AREAS E OF THE TROUGH. AT THE SAME TIME...SATELLITE WATER VAPOR 
LOOPING SUGGESTED AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH HAD MOVED EAST OF 
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...WHILE ITS SOUTHERN END WAS HANGING SW NEAR 
THE KEYS OR MAYBE JUST TO THE WEST OF THE KEYS. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS BLOSSOMED OVER THE KEYS AS WELL AS NEARBY GULF WATERS, 
FLORIDA BAY, AND OVER A LARGE SWATH OF THE FLORIDA STRAITS AROUND 
MIDNIGHT. AS OF 4 AM...THE SURFACE TROUGH SEEMS TO HAVE FINALLY 
BEGUN TO SLIDE EASTWARD AS EXPECTED...TURNING UPPER KEYS WINDS TO 
NW-N AND PUSHING MOST SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EAST INTO THE 
STRAITS. ONE RATHER LARGE CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WAS 
STILL ONGOING OVER THE LOWER KEYS. LOWER DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S HAVE 
ADVECTED INTO NORTHERN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY BEHIND THE TROUGH...WHILE 
THE KEYS STILL HAVE HUMID SURFACE AIR WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 
70S. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY...ALL MODELS AGREE THAT BY 8 AM THIS MORNING...THE 500 MB 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH AXIS WILL HAVE SHIFT JUST EAST OF THE KEYS...
WHILE AT 250 MB A SHARPER TROUGH AXIS WILL BE OVER THE BAHAMAS WITH
STRONG (GREATER THAN 50 KT) NW WINDS BLOWING OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS. 
AT THE SURFACE THE WEAK TROUGH TOO IS SHOWN BY BOTH GFS AND WRF 
MODELS TO HAVE NUDGED EAST OF THE KEYS INTO THE STRAITS. AS A 
RESULT...UPPER SUPPORT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL AS THE 
WEAK SURFACE CONVERGENCE SHOULD HAVE SHIFTED EAST INTO THE STRAITS. 
SINCE ONGOING SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY IMPACT SOME OF THE KEYS AT ZONE 
ISSUANCE TIME...I WILL INDICATE 30 PCT CHANCE OF PRECIP DUE TO 
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS EARLY...GIVING WAY TO JUST 
ISOLATED SHOWERS THEREAFTER. AN UPDATE TO ZONES WILL BE MADE LATER 
THIS MORNING WHEN SHOWERS AND STORMS HAVE ALL SHIFTED EAST. DRYING 
SHOULD BE LIMITED MAINLY TO LEVELS 10 THSD FT AGL AND UPWARD 
ACCORDING TO FORECAST SOUNDINGS. THIS WILL LEAVE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE FOR POSSIBLY A FEW SHOWERS DURING THE DAY...BUT MID AND 
HIGH CLOUDS OUGHT TO MOVE OUT WITH THE DRYING ALOFT. 

TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN IS STILL 
EXPECTED TO SET IN OVER THE KEYS...POSSIBLY WITH A VERY WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE CELL NEAR OR JUST WEST OF THE KEYS. VARIABLE WINDS UNDER 10 
KT WILL CHARACTERIZE THE OVERALL WIND FLOW ALTHOUGH A LIGHT NW FLOW 
MAY BE AROUND PART OF THE TIME WEDNESDAY. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS 
SHOWN TO REMAIN PLENTIFUL...AT THE SURFACE UP TO 700 MB...THROUGH 
WED...THEN
SOME LOWER LEVEL DRYING IS SEEN IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS TO SET IN WED 
NIGHT THROUGH THU NIGHT. 20 PCT POPS WILL BE CARRIED FOR NOW FOR 
EACH 12 HOUR PERIOD. THERE ARE NOW INDICATION OF SIGNIFICANT 
SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT DURING THIS PERIOD...AND UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE 
FORECAST TO BE W TO NW. 

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...THE EXTENDED GFS HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT 
FROM RUN-TO-RUN WITH REGARD TO MOVEMENT OF A COLD FRONT SE OVER 
FLORIDA. THE LAST RUN HAS IT OVER EXTREME NORTH FLORIDA AS OF 8 AM 
FRIDAY...THEN INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA FRIDAY NIGHT. TROUGHINESS ALONG 
AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT IS SHOWN TO TURN KEYS WINDS TO W THEN NW...
NOT AT STRONG SPEEDS...DURING FRI AND FRI NIGHT. AND THERE IS 
INDICATION OF A WEAK MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVING EAST OVER 
THE AREA DURING THIS TIME. I WILL CULL OUT FRI AND FRI NIGHT TO SHOW 
JUST A SLIGHTLY BETTER THREAT OF SHOWERS...30 PCT. 

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...NO WELL DEFINED COOLING IS SHOWN TO REACH 
THE KEYS...BUT A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE AREA SPILLING INTO THE EASTERN 
STATES IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE MODERATE N TO NE WINDS SETTING IN BY 
SATURDAY...TURNING TO E AND CONTINUING AT MODERATE SPEEDS BY MONDAY.
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE RETAINED DUE TO SOME LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE CONTENT IN THE NE TO E FLOW.

.MARINE...
A WEAK TROUGH SHOULD NUDGE EAST OF THE KEYS AND INTO THE STRAITS 
EARLY TODAY...TAKING WINDS TO A GENERAL NORTH DIRECTION CLOSE TO 10 
KT AT TIMES. DURING THE AFTERNOON...SLIGHTLY LOWER PRESSURES OVER 
THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND MAY CAUSE WINDS OVER FLORIDA BAY AND 
AROUND THE UPPER KEYS ATLANTIC WATERS TO GO VARIABLE 5-10 KT. 
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO BE OVER THE REGION TONIGHT ON 
THROUGH THURSDAY...CAUSING VARIABLE WINDS 5-10 KT ALTHOUGH WIND 
DIRECTION MAY FAVOR NW PART OF THIS TIME. AN APPROACHING TROUGH IS 
EXPECTED SWING WINDS TO W THEN NW FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT...WITH
STRONGER (AT LEAST 10-15 KT) NE WINDS SETTING IN NEXT SATURDAY.

SHOULD BE LIMITED MAINLY TO LEVELS 10 THSD FT AGL AND UPWARD 
ACCORDING TO FORECAST SOUNDINGS. THIS WILL LEAVE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE FOR POSSIBLY A FEW SHOWERS DURING THE DAY...BUT MID AND 
HIGH CLOUDS OUGHT TO MOVE OUT WITH THE DRYING ALOFT. 

TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN IS STILL 
EXPECTED TO SET IN OVER THE KEYS...POSSIBLY WITH A VERY WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE CELL NEAR OR JUST WEST OF THE KEYS. VARIABLE WINDS UNDER 10 
KT WILL CHARACTERIZE THE OVERALL WIND FLOW ALTHOUGH A LIGHT NW FLOW 
MAY BE AROUND PART OF THE TIME WEDNESDAY. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS 
SHOWN TO REMAIN PLENTIFUL...AT THE SURFACE UP TO 700 MB...THROUGH

FOR EACH 12 HOUR PERIOD. THERE ARE NO INDICATIONS OF SIGNIFICANT 
SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT DURING THIS PERIOD...AND UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE 
FORECAST TO BE W TO NW. 

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...THE EXTENDED GFS HAS BEEN INCONSISTENT 
FROM RUN-TO-RUN WITH REGARD TO MOVEMENT OF A COLD FRONT SE OVER 
FLORIDA. THE LAST RUN HAS IT OVER EXTREME NORTH FLORIDA AS OF 8 AM 
FRIDAY...THEN INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA FRIDAY NIGHT. TROUGHINESS ALONG

NOT AT STRONG SPEEDS...DURING FRI AND FRI NIGHT. AND THERE IS 
INDICATION OF A WEAK MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVING EAST OVER 
THE AREA DURING THIS TIME. I WILL CULL OUT FRI AND FRI NIGHT TO SHOW 
JUST A SLIGHTLY BETTER THREAT OF SHOWERS...30 PCT. 

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...NO WELL DEFINED COOLING IS SHOWN TO REACH 
THE KEYS...BUT A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE AREA SPILLING INTO THE EASTERN 
STATES IS EXPECTED TO GENERATE MODERATE N TO NE WINDS SETTING IN BY 
SATURDAY...TURNING TO E AND CONTINUING AT MODERATE SPEEDS BY MONDAY.
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE RETAINED DUE TO SOME LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE CONTENT IN THE NE TO E FLOW.

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS -- SURFACE WINDS HAVE NOW TURNED NORTHEAST AT ALL REPORTING 
STATIONS ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...INDICATING THAT A SHEAR LINE HAS 
NOW MOVED JUST SOUTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN. GOES-12 VISIBLE CHANNEL 
IMAGE LOOPS SHOW ENHANCED CLOUDINESS AND CONVECTION OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...JUST WEST OF THE KEYS. IT IS IN THIS 
SMALL AREA WHERE THE SURFACE SHEAR AXIS IS COINCIDENT WITH A REGION 
OF WEAK ISENTROPIC ASCENT AT 5000-10000FT AGL AND A DEEPER LAYER OF 
MOIST...TROPICAL AIR. THE KEYS LIE ON THE EXTREME NORTHERN EDGE OF 
THIS MARITIME TROPICAL AIR...AND SUB-70F DEWPOINTS ARE NOT FAR AWAY 
TO THE NORTH.

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS AFTERNOON SHOWS THE DEEP 
CYCLONE OFF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST NOW MOVING EAST-NORTHEASTWARD 
AS EXPECTED. VERY DRY MID-TROPOSPHERIC AIR CAN BE SEEN IN GOES-12 
MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGERY MOVING SOUTH OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. 
THE UPPER-LEVEL JET MAX THAT WAS OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA EARLIER 
TODAY HAS SHIFTED EAST OVER THE BAHAMAS.

FORECASTS -- ZONAL FLOW WILL PREVAIL ALOFT FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
ACROSS THE GULF BASIN AND FLORIDA PENINSULA IN THE WAKE OF THE 
DEPARTING CYCLONE. NORTHEAST OR NORTH WINDS ARE EXPECTED IN THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER OVER THE KEYS AS THE SOUTH CAROLINA CYCLONE 
TRANSLATES NORTHEASTWARD AND A WEAK ANTICYCLONE DROPS SOUTH OVER THE 
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. THESE AIR TRAJECTORIES WILL BE ROOTED IN 
MODIFIED CONTINENTAL AIR...WHICH WILL DECREASE LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE 
AND WEAKEN LAPSE RATES LOCALLY...THEREBY DECREASING RAIN CHANCES AND 
VIRTUALLY ELIMINATING THE CHANCE FOR THUNDER...AT LEAST THROUGH MID 
WEEK.

BY WEDNESDAY...STRONG GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS OVER SOUTHERN CANADA 
AND THE NORTH-CENTRAL UNITED STATES WILL RESULT IN A LARGE AREA OF 
UPPER-LEVEL CYCLONIC FLOW OVER THE NORTHERN UNITED STATES...AS WELL 
AS STRONG SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE GREAT LAKES...THE 
ACCELERATION OF A COLD FRONT TO THE SOUTH...AND A SURGE OF MODIFIED 
ARCTIC AIR IN ITS WAKE. HOWEVER...NCEP GLOBAL MODEL ENSEMBLES 
CONTINUE TO INDICATE A LARGE DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE 
EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER-AIR FLOW PATTERN...THE ASSOCIATED MOVEMENT OF 
THE SURFACE FRONTAL ZONE...AND RESULTING WIND/PRESSURE/TEMPERATURE/ 
MOISTURE PATTERN OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS....PARTICULARLY FOR 
THE THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY TIME FRAME. THEREFORE...THE FORECASTS 
FOR THESE PERIODS WILL BE HEAVILY WEIGHTED BY CLIMATOLOGY. AT THIS 
POINT...THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO WILL BE A WEAK FRONTAL PASSAGE 
SOMETIME FRIDAY OR SATURDAY...PERHAPS ACCOMPANIED BY A BAND OF 
SHOWERS...AND FOLLOWED BY SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER AIR. BUT...AS 
ALLUDED TO...FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS VERY LOW.

.DISCUSSION...
SHOWERS AFFECTED PORTIONS OF THE LOWER KEYS EARLIER THIS MORNING. AN 
EPISODE OF HEAVY RAIN IN KEY WEST RESULTED IN 0.51 INCHES OF 
RAINFALL AT THE AIRPORT AND 0.84 INCHES HERE AT THE WFO. A MORNING 
UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS REVEALS AN INTERESTING SETUP ACROSS 
THE REGION. IT SEEMS THAT THE WEATHER IS OCCURRING AT THE 
INTERSECTION OF THREE DISTINCT FORCING FEATURES. IN THE UPPER 
TROPOSPHERE...A JET MAX IS LOCATED BETWEEN THE BAHAMAS AND THE 
SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. THIS JET MAX IS DEPICTED WELL IN EARLY 
MORNING IMAGES FROM THE GOES-12 VISIBLE CHANNEL. IN THE LOWER 
TROPOSPHERE...A ZONE OF WEAK ISENTROPIC ASCENT IS EVIDENT FROM SOUTH 
FLORIDA TO THE YUCATAN CHANNEL. THIS ZONE OF ASCENT ROUGHLY 
DELINEATES BETWEEN THE DRIER AIR OVER MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
MARITIME TROPICAL AIR MASS OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN BASIN AND 
SOUTH-CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. NOTE THE ALTOCUMULUS DECK OVER 
PORTIONS OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE SOUTHEAST GULF. FINALLY...AT THE 
SURFACE A DISTINCT MESOALPHA SCALE SHEAR/VORTICITY ZONE IS EVIDENT 
FROM THE KEYS EXTENDING WEST TO THE SOUTH-CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. 
SATELLITE IMAGES FROM THE VISIBLE CHANNEL ALSO CLEARLY SHOW A 
BOUNDARY IN THIS REGION. THE BOUNDARY BASICALLY SEPARATES GENTLE TO 
MODERATE NORTHEAST BREEZES TO THE NORTH FROM LIGHT EAST OR SOUTHEAST 
BREEZES TO THE SOUTH. THIS MORNINGS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
FOUND AT THE INTERSECTION OF THE THREE FORCING FEATURES DESCRIBED.

SO THE FIRST PERIOD FORECAST QUESTION BECOMES:  WHAT HAPPENS TO THE 
THREE FORCING FEATURES AND ASSOCIATED INTERSECTION? THE JET MAX 
SHOULD MOVE EAST...TAKING ITS FORCING OUT OF THE MIX. THE ISENTROPIC 
ASCENT ZONE WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY. THE SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL 
LIKELY MOVE SOUTH. THEREFORE...THE AREA WITH THE MOST FAVORABLE 
FORCING BECOMES NOT QUITE SO FAVORABLE WHILE MOVING A LITTLE TO THE 
SOUTH. THIS MEANS THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS STILL COULD SEE 
SHOWERS OR STORMS LATER TODAY. CURRENT FORECASTS SHOW SCATTERED 
COVERAGE FOR KEYS AND ATLANTIC WATERS...AND THIS IS APPROPRIATE 
GIVEN THE SITUATION.
&&

.MARINE...
VARIABLE BREEZES WILL BECOME LIGHT NORTHEAST IN MOST LOCATIONS THIS 
AFTERNOON. WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE HIGHER IN AND NEAR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.
&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH 24Z...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...INCLUDING THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. A WEAK LOW LEVEL 
TROUGH PRESENTLY MOVING ACROSS THE LOWER FLORIDA KEYS...WILL AID IN 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED HEAVY SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE. THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL 
CONTAIN SHORT LIVED PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR CIGS AND/OR VIS THRU THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. VARIABLE WINDS 5 TO 10 KNOTS WILL GRADUALLY 
BECOME NORTHEAST.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
500 AM EDT MON OCT 9 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
BASED ON SURFACE WIND PATTERN AND DEWPOINT TRENDS...A WEAK TROUGH AS 
OF 2 AM EXTENDED FROM A LOW CENTER EAST OF NORTH FLORIDA...THEN SW 
OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA AND INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO 
OFFSHORE FROM THE NAPLES AREA. KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE BEEN LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE OVER NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJACENT 
WATERS...WHILE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS AREAS AND THEIR RESPECTIVE 
ADJACENT WATERS HAVE SEEN ESE WINDS 5-10 KT OVERNIGHT. DRY AND QUIET 
CONDITIONS ARE SEEN TO OUR NORTH OVER THE PENINSULA NORTH OF THE 
TROUGH. ON THE OTHER HAND...AREAS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE 
BEEN OCCURRING OVER CUBA, OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN, AND THESE HAVE BEEN 
SPEWING PERIODS OF THICKER MID AND HIGH CLOUDS UP OVER THE KEYS. 
MORE SIGNIFICANTLY...SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FORMED 
OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA BETWEEN KEY WEST, DRY TORTUGAS, AND 
CUBA. CIRRUS FLOW ON SATELLITE LOOPING SUGGESTS A LOW AMPLITUDE 
UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVING OVER THE CENTRAL GULF OF 
MEXICO. 

.FORECAST...
THROUGH THE NEXT 7 DAYS...MODELS ARE DIFFERING WITH EACH OTHER AND 
ALSO FROM RUN-TO-RUN...WITH DETAILS OF MOVEMENT AND STRENGTH OF 
TROUGHS AND FRONTAL SYSTEMS MOVING INTO FLORIDA, AS WELL AS BEHAVIOR 
OF FOLLOWING HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEMS OVER THE EASTERN U.S.  IN THE 
NEAR TERM...GFS AND WRF MODELS ARE AT ODDS WITH RESPECT TO MOISTURE 
FIELDS AND LIGHT WIND PATTERNS OVER THE KEYS. BASED PARTLY ON THE 
INCREASE IN MOISTURE JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE KEYS...ILL LEAN 
SLIGHTLY TOWARD GFS GUIDANCE.

TODAY AND TONIGHT...GFS INDICATES THE WEAK SURFACE TROUGH WILL SLIDE 
SE AND E OF THE KEYS TODAY. HOWEVER...AT 850 MB A STEADY MORE MOIST 
SW WIND FLOW IS INDICATED. THE GFS SHOWS DEEPENING MOISTURE OVER THE 
KEYS TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT WITH SOME LOW TO MID LEVEL SYNOPTIC SCALE 
LIFT (MAYBE IN PART DUE TO THE APPROACH OF A WEAK MID TO HIGH LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH). AS A RESULT THE GFS MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS HAVE 
GENERATED PROBABILITIES OF PRECIPITATION OF 50 AND 70 PCT FOR THE 
KEYS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. WRF MODEL SHOWS A DRY LAYER PERSISTING 
JUST BELOW 850 MB MOST OF THE TIME TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH POPS OF 
ONLY 10 PCT FOR EACH 12 HOUR PERIOD. CURRENT TRENDS IN THE WESTERN 
STRAITS SHOW INCREASING SHOWERS AND SOME THUNDER...SO I HAVE 
CONSERVATIVELY BUMPED UP POPS TO 30 PCT FOR TODAY. THIS MAY NEED 
RAISING AT MIDDAY. I HAVE LEFT TONIGHTS CURRENTLY FORECAST 20 PCT 
POPS IN PLACE...SINCE THE LATEST GFS RUN IS SOMEWHAT DIFFERENT FROM 
PRECEDING RUNS. CONTINUITY WITH THE NEXT COUPLE OF RUNS MAY CLARIFY 
THIS TREND. 

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AGAIN THE LATEST GFS MAINTAINS 
SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE AT LOW LEVELS...SURFACE UP TO 10 THSD FT AGL...
WHILE THE WRF SHOWS A BIT MORE MOISTURE TUE THROUGH WED THEN DRYING 
WED NIGHT AND THU. I WILL NOT CHANGE ONGOING 20 AND 10 PCT POPS FOR 
VARIOUS PERIODS IN THIS TIME FRAME. NO SIGNIFICANT UPPER LEVEL LIFT 
NOR SURFACE CONVERGENCE ARE SEEN...WITH A LIGHT N TO NE WIND FLOW AT 
THE SURFACE. LATEST GFS INDICATES A SLUG OF DRY AIR AT 850 MB COMING 
OVER THE KEYS THU NIGHT AND FRI...BUT TIMING AND LOCATION OF THIS IS 
TOO UNCERTAIN. 

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...A FRONT COMING SOUTH OVER FLORIDA IS 
CURRENTLY NOT SHOWN BY EXTENDED PROGS TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
KEYS...WITH 1000-850 MB THICKNESS AND LIFTED INDEX GRADIENT SHOWING 
THE BAROCLINIC ZONE AND ASSOCIATED COOLING REMAIN TO OUR NORTH. 
HOWEVER...THE LARGE HIGH PRESSURE AREA SPREADING OVER THE EASTERN 
U.S. IS SHOWN TO BUILD SOUTH ACROSS ANY FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND BRING 
INCREASING NE TO E WINDS TO THE KEYS DURING THIS TIME FRAME. 
&&

.MARINE...
AN ERRATIC WIND PATTERN EARLY THIS MORNING...IS EXPECTED TO BECOME 
MORE DISCERNIBLY NE CLOSER 10 KT BY THIS AFTERNOON AS A WEAK LOW 
PRESSURE TROUGH EASES E AND SE OF THE KEYS. N TO NE BREEZES NEAR 10 
KT SHOULD PERSIST UNTIL ABOUT WEDNESDAY WHEN A WEAK PRESSURE 
GRADIENT MAY AGAIN GIVE A VARIABLE WIND PATTERN THROUGH FRIDAY. 
AT THIS TIME...AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER THE 
EASTERN U.S. PERHAPS GIVING AN INCREASE IN NE TO E WINDS GOING INTO 
NEXT WEEKEND.
&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH 24Z...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...INCLUDING THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
POSSIBLY A FEW THUNDERSTORMS MAY BEGIN TO DEVELOP ALONG THE ROUTE 
LATER THIS MORNING INTO THIS AFTERNOON...PRODUCING BRIEF PERIODS OF 
MVFR TO IFR CIGS AND/OR VIS. SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYS ISLAND

THE AREA OF MID TO UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE VERY NEAR THE SOUTHEAST 
GEORGIA COAST SHOWING SIGNS OF SHIFTING OFF TO THE EAST...AND WILL 
CONTINUE TO THE EAST AND NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT AS IT WEAKENS. CLOSER 
TO THE IMMEDIATE AREA...A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN WILL ALLOW WINDS TO

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
420 AM EDT SUN OCT 8 2006

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS -- GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS DEPICT A 
LARGE...SWIRLING CYCLONIC VORTEX CENTERED OVER SOUTH 
CAROLINA...MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD. THIS VORTEX HAS TRANSPORTED DRY 
AIR OVER THE SERVICE AREA AT 5000-10000FT AGL...WHICH HAS HELPED 
KEEP CONVECTIVE CLOUD COVERAGE AT A MINIMUM DURING THE LAST 24 
HOURS. LATEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW JUST A FEW SHOWERS OVER 
WATERS BEYOND 50NM SOUTH OF THE DRY TORTUGAS. A SURFACE ANALYSIS 
EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWS A 1029MB ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER NEW YORK 
STATE WITH A RIDGE EXTENDING SOUTHWEST TO TEXAS. A BAROCLINIC ZONE 
IS EVIDENT ALONG THE GULF AND SOUTH ATLANTIC COASTS...SEPARATING 
CONTINENTAL AIR FROM MARITIME TROPICAL OR MODIFIED CONTINENTAL 
AIR...AND A NORTH-SOUTH TROUGH HAS NOW DEVELOPED OVER THE GULF 
STREAM OFFSHORE SOUTH CAROLINA AND GEORGIA...WITHIN THE COASTAL 
BAROCLINIC ZONE AND JUST SOUTH OF THE UPPER CYCLONE. THE TRUE TRADE 
WIND BELT REMAINS CONFINED TO THE CARIBBEAN BASIN...WHILE THE 
FLORIDA KEYS ARE IN A REGIME OF GENTLE EAST BREEZES. AIR 
TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ISLANDS THIS MORNING ARE STEADY IN THE LOWER 
80S...WITH DEWPOINTS NEAR 70F. A BRILLIANT HARVEST MOON REVEALS JUST 
A FEW PUFFY CUMULUS HUMILIS AND CIRRUS STRANDS.

FORECAST -- TODAY AND TONIGHT:  THE LARGE UPPER CYCLONE CURRENTLY 
CENTERED OVER SOUTH CAROLINA WILL MOVE TO ITS SOUTHERNMOST POSITION 
OFF THE COAST OF GEORGIA...AND THEN BEGIN MOVING EAST. A SURFACE 
TROUGH SHOULD PERSIST OVER THE COASTAL BAROCLINIC ZONE OFFSHORE 
GEORGIA AND SOUTH CAROLINA. THIS WILL HAVE THE EFFECT OF TURNING 
WINDS NORTHEAST IN THE KEYS TONIGHT. NEARLY RAIN-FREE CONDITIONS ARE 
EXPECTED OVER MOST OF THE ISLANDS TODAY...WITH SHOWERS MOST NUMEROUS 
OVER THE WATERS BEYOND THE REEF. THERE MAY BE A SLIGHTLY BETTER 
CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR LONE THUNDERSTORM TONIGHT...WITH MOST 
ACTIVITY STILL PERSISTING OVER THE ATLANTIC MARINE ZONES.

COLUMBUS DAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT:  A SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION WILL 
OCCUR WITH THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN OVER NORTH AMERICA. THE UPPER 
CYCLONE OFF GEORGIA WILL EJECT EAST-NORTHEASTWARD AND OPEN UP OVER 
THE ATLANTIC...WHILE UPPER WESTERLIES DEVELOP OVER THE GULF BASIN. 
MEANWHILE...STRONG GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS WILL OCCUR OVER THE 
NORTHERN UNITED STATES AS A STRONG TROUGH DIGS SOUTHWARD. LOCALLY... 
THE SURFACE PRESSURE PATTERN BECOMES ERRATIC...WITH LIGHT NORTHEAST 
WINDS PROBABLY BECOMING LIGHT AND VARIABLE BY LATE TUESDAY NIGHT.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY:  NCEP GLOBAL MODEL ENSEMBLE OUTPUT 
SUGGESTS A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH REGARD TO THE FORECAST 
FOR THIS TIME FRAME. THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO IS FOR AN INTENSE 
UPPER VORTEX/COLD POOL AND ASSOCIATED STRONG HEIGHT FALLS TO INDUCE 
CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE GREAT LAKES...WITH ANTICYCLOGENESIS IN 
CONTINENTAL POLAR AIR OVER SOUTHERN CANADA/NORTHERN HIGH PLAINS. A 
RESULTING STRONG COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES...APPROACHING THE FLORIDA KEYS BY PERHAPS EARLY 
FRIDAY. SOME DEGREE OF BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTENING WOULD BE LIKELY BY 
WEDNESDAY WITH A RESULTANT INCREASE IN BUOYANCY AND RAIN CHANCES... 
WITH POSSIBLE FRONTAL FORCING BY FRIDAY. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY 
SHOWN BY MODEL ENSEMBLES FOR THIS LATITUDE...I HAVE TRENDED 
FORECASTS TOWARD CLIMATOLOGY IN THE EXTENDED PORTION OF THE 
FORECAST. BE THAT AS IT MAY...THERE APPEARS TO BE AN INCREASING 
PROBABILITY OF THE FIRST TRUE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE IN THE KEYS SINCE 
LAST SPRING.
&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE EAST BREEZES WILL PREVAIL ACROSS THE KEYS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH BREEZES LIKELY TURNING NORTHEAST BY 
DAYBREAK. GENTLE NORTHEAST BREEZES WILL PROBABLY BECOME LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE BY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THERE APPEARS TO BE AN 
INCREASING CHANCE FOR A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE BY LATE IN THE WEEK. 
CHECK FORECASTS REGULARLY FOR UPDATES.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS

NEAR 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE EAST NEAR 10 KNOTS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 80S. ONLY ABOUT EIGHT DEGREES OF COOLING 
IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO GENTLE NORTHEAST TO EAST SURFACE WINDS 
OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)... 
IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW

BEFORE DISSIPATING SUNDAY NIGHT. IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE...A LARGE AND STRONG AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE 
SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE CAROLINAS TONIGHT AND INTO SOUTHEASTERN GEORGIA 
SUNDAY. THIS UPPER LEVEL AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO WEAKEN 
AND LIFT TO THE NORTHEAST SUNDAY NIGHT. THE COMBINATION OF DRY AIR 
AND SUBSIDENCE ALONG THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE UPPER LEVEL LOW 
PRESSURE AREA SHOULD LIMIT RAIN CHANCES TO ONLY 10 PERCENT FOR 
TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE MAY BEGIN TO INCREASE 
SUNDAY NIGHT. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL INDICATES RELATIVE HUMIDITY 
VALUES OF GREATER THAN 80 PERCENT FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH AT LEAST 
10 KFT SUNDAY NIGHT AND COLUMBUS DAY. AS A DIRECT RESULT...
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES COULD RISE ABOVE ONE AND THREE 
QUARTERS OF AN INCH SUNDAY NIGHT AND COLUMBUS DAY. POPS WILL BE 
RAISED BY 10 PERCENT FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND COLUMBUS DAY DUE TO THE 
EXPECTED INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD 
ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA MONDAY NIGHT. NO CHANGES TO THE MONDAY 
NIGHT PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES TUESDAY AND 
TUESDAY NIGHT. EASTERLY FLOW TUESDAY NIGHT SHOULD BRING DEEP 
TROPICAL MOISTURE INTO THE SERVICE AREA. PWAT VALUES SHOULD CLIMB TO 
NEAR TWO INCHES TUESDAY NIGHT. POPS WILL BE RAISED BY 10 PERCENT FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT DUE TYPICAL NOCTURNAL ENHANCEMENT OF CONVECTION

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
335 AM EDT SAT OCT 7 2006

.DISCUSSION...
AN ANALYSIS OF THE DEEP LAYER MEAN CIRCULATION THIS MORNING REVEALS 
A CELLULAR FLOW PATTERN ACROSS EASTERN NORTH AMERICA AND THE WESTERN 
NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN. A LARGE ANTICYCLONE WAS CENTERED OVER THE 
GREAT PLAINS...A LARGE CYCLONE WAS CENTERED OVER NORTH CAROLINA... 
AND ANOTHER LARGE ANTICYCLONE WAS CENTERED OVER THE SUBTROPICAL 
NORTH ATLANTIC. DEEP WESTERLIES WERE CONFINED TO CANADA AND THE 
NORTHERN LATITUDES WHILE DEEP EASTERLIES WERE CONFINED TO THE 
TROPICAL ATLANTIC AND CARIBBEAN BASINS. THE FLORIDA KEYS WERE 
LOCATED AT THE FAR SOUTHERN END OF THE DEEP CYCLONIC CIRCULATION 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE VORTEX OVER NORTH CAROLINA. THE SURFACE PRESSURE 
PATTERN WAS QUITE COMPLEX ACROSS THE REGION. BASICALLY...THE KEYS 
ARE IN A REGIME OF LIGHT NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW BETWEEN THE EASTERLY 
TRADES OVER THE CARIBBEAN AND DIFLUENT FLOW ASSOCIATED WITH BROAD 
RIDGING OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES. 

TRENDS FROM LOCAL GPS-MET SENSORS REVEAL TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER 
DECREASES SINCE 00Z. THIS IS PROBABLY DUE TO SOME DRIER AIR 
FILTERING INTO THE MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE. DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW JUST 
ISOLATED SHOWERS ALONG A BOUNDARY FROM ABOUT 25 MILES WEST OF CAPE 
SABLE TO NEAR THE DRY TORTUGAS. MOONLIT SKIES COMPRISE SCATTERED 
CUMULUS MEDIOCRIS AND STRANDS OF CIRRUS. AIR TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE 
ISLANDS ARE HOLDING NEAR 80F...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW 70S. 
SUB-70F DEWPOINTS ARE LESS THAN 100 MILES AWAY TO THE NORTH.

FORECASTS:
TODAY THROUGH COLUMBUS DAY - THE LARGE CUT-OFF CYCLONE CURRENTLY 
CENTERED OVER NORTH CAROLINA IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH... 
REACHING AS FAR SOUTH AS COASTAL GEORGIA BY SUNDAY NIGHT. A 
DEVELOPING PROGRESSIVE UPPER-AIR PATTERN WILL THEN LEAD TO THE 
EAST-NORTHEASTWARD EJECTION AND WEAKENING OF THE CYCLONE ON MONDAY 
AND MONDAY NIGHT. THE PROXIMITY OF THE LARGE AND DEEP CYCLONE NORTH 
OF THE KEYS WILL ALLOW CONTINUED FILTRATION OF DRY MIDLATITUDE AIR 
INTO THE MIDDLE AND LOWER TROPOSPHERE LOCALLY. IN ADDITION... 
EPISODES OF SYNOPTIC-SCALE SUBSIDENCE WILL WEAKEN MID-LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES. THE COMBINATION OF DRY AIR AND LIMITED INSTABILITY WILL KEEP 
RAIN CHANCES LOW...BUT NONZERO...THROUGH COLUMBUS DAY. 

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY - NCEP GLOBAL MODEL ENSEMBLE OUTPUT SHOW 
A VERY HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE EVOLUTION OF GEOPOTENTIAL 
HEIGHT FIELDS ACROSS THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES AND ASSOCIATED 
SURFACE FEATURES AT OUR LATITUDE. SUBSEQUENTLY... WE WILL STAY VERY 
CLOSE TO A CLIMATOLOGICAL FORECAST FOR THIS TIME FRAME UNTIL A 
COHERENT AND MORE PREDICTABLE PATTERN EMERGES.

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING REVEALS A 
MASSIVE DEEP LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS...WITH A RAPIDLY AMPLIFYING SHORT WAVE TROUGH DIGGING 
EQUATORWARD ALONG ITS EASTERN FLANK...OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. ANOTHER 
LARGE ANTICYCLONE WAS CENTERED OVER THE SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC...WITH 
A WEAKER TROUGH ALONG ITS WESTERN FLANK. DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS... 
THE OHIO VALLEY SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE FURTHER SOUTH...BECOMING 
A LARGE CYCLONE CENTERED OVER NORTH CAROLINA. AMBIENT CYCLONIC 
VORTICITY OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES...FLORIDA PENINSULA...AND 
ATLANTIC OCEAN WILL BECOME ABSORBED IN BANDS INTO A LARGE CYCLONIC 
GYRE CIRCULATING AROUND THE CYCLONE CENTER. THE CYCLONE WILL THEN 
MOVE FURTHER SOUTH TO SOUTHERN GEORGIA AND NORTHERN FLORIDA BY 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON...BEFORE THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN BECOMES PROGRESSIVE 
AGAIN...EJECTING THE CYCLONE EAST-NORTHEASTWARD SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. TWO FEATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UNIQUE SYSTEM WILL HAVE 
AN IMPACT ON KEYS WEATHER DURING THE NEXT 3-4 DAYS:  1) DRY AIR IN 
THE MIDDLE AND LOWER TROPOSPHERE WILL BE TRANSPORTED OVER THE 
FLORIDA KEYS...ALONG THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN FLANK OF THE 
CYCLONE...PARTICULARLY DURING THE SATURDAY NIGHT-MONDAY NIGHT TIME 
FRAME 2) BANDS OF SUBSIDENCE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE KEYS AROUND THE 
PERIPHERY OF THE CYCLONE...RENDERING VERY WEAK MID-LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES. THE COMBINATION OF DRY AIR AND SUBSIDENCE ON A LARGE SCALE 
SHOULD VERY MUCH LIMIT CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL AND THUS RAIN CHANCES 
DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. BY MID 
WEEK...A CHANGING UPPER-AIR PATTERN WILL LIKELY FACILITATE AN 
INCREASE IN LAYER PRECIPITABLE WATER CONTENT OVER THE REGION WITH AN 
ASSOCIATED INCREASE IN RAIN CHANCES.

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN U.S. AND LOW 
PRESSURE OVER THE CARIBBEAN AND BAHAMAS ARE COMBINING TO PRODUCE A 
TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS. THIS HAS RESULTED IN PERSISTENT MAINLY NORTHEAST WINDS OF 
NEAR 20 KT AT THE CMAN STATIONS ALONG THE REEF AND 15 TO 20 MPH AND 
GUSTY ON THE ISLANDS. THE 00Z KEY WEST RAOB SHOWS AN INVERSION BASED 
JUST ABOVE 10 KFT...AND THE WINDS HAVE ALLOWED MOISTURE TO MIX 
THROUGH THE LAYER FROM THE SURFACE UP TO THE INVERSION. AS A RESULT 
WIDESPREAD CEILINGS BETWEEN 7500 FT AND 10000 FT AGL COVER THE 
FLORIDA KEYS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 80 WITH DEWPOINTS NEAR 70. 
SCATTERED CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE MOVING QUICKLY 
OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS...WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS AFFECTING THE 
MAINLAND...UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS...AND FLORIDA BAY. THERE IS A BROAD 
CYCLONIC CURVATURE TO THE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM MOTION EVIDENT ON 
KBYX RADAR...PROBABLY DUE TO A PERTURBATION IN THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW 
MOVING THROUGH OUR AREA...WHICH MAY BE ENHANCING THE CONVECTION OVER 
THE STRAITS.

.FORECAST...
SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE MOVING 
OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST WILL CAUSE PRESSURES TO FALL IN THE 
EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN STATES...AND THUS RELAX THE PRESSURE 
GRADIENT IN OUR AREA. A DEVELOPING TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE NORTHEAST 
OF THE BAHAMAS WILL COMPOUND THE RELAXING OF THE GRADIENT. AS A 
RESULT...WINDS OVER THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS WILL GRADUALLY 
DECREASE THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING. HOWEVER...WINDS WILL REMAIN 
NORTHEAST TO EAST NORTHEAST WITH AMPLE LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE...THUS 40 
POPS LOOK GOOD FOR THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. THE CURRENT FORECAST 
PACKAGE HANDLES THE SITUATION VERY WELL...AND FEW CHANGES ARE 
ANTICIPATED AT MORNING ISSUANCE.

EXTENDED (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A 500 MB AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL MOVE QUICKLY SOUTH SOUTHEASTWARD FROM THE GREAT LAKES 
TO THE VIRGINIA/NORTH CAROLINA AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN MOVE 
ERRATICALLY SOUTHWARD OFF THE SOUTH CAROLINA/GEORGIA COAST THROUGH 
SUNDAY NIGHT BEFORE EJECTING NORTHEASTWARD EARLY NEXT WEEK. IN THE 
LOW LEVELS...THE REFLECTION OF THIS LOW PRESSURE WILL CAUSE AN AREA 
OF HIGH PRESSURE TO BE SQUEEZED TO THE WEST OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY AND APPALACHIANS. THE SOUTHEASTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL SPILL DOWN INTO FLORIDA...MAINTAINING OUR SOMEWHAT 
LIGHTER NORTHEAST TO EAST NORTHEAST WINDS INTO NEXT WEEK. MODELS 
HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN BRINGING IN DRY AIR AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF 
THE HIGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...THUS LEADING TO LOWER ISOLATED POPS IN 
THE EXTENDED PERIODS.

THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...KBYX HAS INDICATED 
INCREASED COVERAGE OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT TO 
THE KEYS...AND IN A THIN LINE WHICH HAS BEEN PERSISTENT AS IT SLIDES 
ACROSS THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS. THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW STROKES OF 
LIGHTNING WITH THE STRONGER CELLS OFF IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS WELL 
AWAY FROM THE REEF. OTHERWISE...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY AND THE 
WINDS REMAIN FRESH OUT OF THE NORTHEAST.

.FORECAST...
HAVE SENT A ZONE UPDATE TO REMOVE TRANSITIONAL WORDING. A WEAK LOWER 
BOUNDARY SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH TO MAINTAIN THE INITIAL THIN LINE 
OF SHOWERS DOWN A LARGE STRETCH OF THE KEYS. BEYOND THAT 
THOUGH...BETTER COVERAGE SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
ADJACENT TO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS. KEPT A 30 POP FOR THE 
OVERNIGHT PERIOD ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BOTTOM 
OUT NEAR THE 80 DEGREE MARK AT MOST LOCATIONS.

OF MEXICO...AND A BIT OR STRAITS OFF THE KEYS. THE LESS DEEP DRY AIR 
(HIGHER PW VALUES) HAVE MOVED FROM NEAR ANDROS ISLAND THIS 
MORNING...TO JUST OFF THE UPPER KEYS. SMALL ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE
MOVED INTO THE UPPER KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS WITH THIS DEEPER 
MOISTURE. THE ESTIMATE IS THAT THE INCREASED MOISTURE HEADING WEST 
AND SOUTHWEST INTO THE KEYS IS WITHIN THE 850-700 MB LAYER.
MEANWHILE...SURFACE WINDS REMAIN FROM THE NE NEAR 20 KT AT C-MAN 
SITES ALONG THE KEYS.

TONIGHT...NOT MUCH CHANGE IN PRESSURE PATTERNS WILL MAINTAIN A NE 
BREEZE THROUGH THE NIGHT. GFS MODEL MOISTURE PATTERN SEEMS MORE IN 
TUNE WITH CURRENT REALITY...SO I WILL ADHERE TO ITS FORECAST OF 
SUBTLE CHANGES IN MOISTURE DEPTH THROUGH THE COMING DAYS. IN 
ACCORDANCE...AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE TO LEVELS BELOW 850 MB FOR MOST 
RELATIVE HUMIDITY AT THIS TIME...TO A LITTLE DEEPER LAYER LATE 
TONIGHT...PROMPTS MENTION OF SLIGHT CHANCE EVENING SHOWERS GOING TO 
A CHANCE. GFS MOS HAS 30 PCT FOR THE 12 HOURS...AND THAT I WILL 
STICK WITH. 

THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...A GRADUAL DECREASE IN SURFACE PRESSURES 
OFF THE U.S. EAST COAST WILL LEAD TO LESS WIND SPEEDS OVER THE 
KEYS...SAY IN THE 10-15 MPH RANGE...BUT STILL FROM THE 
EAST-NORTHEAST. AT THE SAME TIME...GFS SHOWS 70 PCT RH VALUES 
SURFACE UP TO 700 MB. A WEAK 500 MB SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS SHOWN TO 
LIMP SSE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS FOR PART OF THIS TIME.
ON THE WHOLE...WITH THE WIND FIELD AND MORE LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE...
I WILL MAINTAIN ONGOING 40 PCT POPS THROUGH SATURDAY...BASED BOTH ON 
GFS MOS...BUT ALSO A SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE WIND PATTERN FOR AFTERNOON 
AND LATE DAY TCU AND SHOWER FORMATION OVER OR NEAR THE KEYS. 

SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...A SLIGHT SURGE IN SURFACE PRESSURE DOWN 
THE PENINSULA IS SHOWN BY THE GFS...BUT LESS SO THAN PRIOR RUNS. 
30 PCT POPS ARE RETAINED. 

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A HUGE UPPER LEVEL LOW IS FORECAST 
TO DEEPEN OFF THE SE U.S. COAST...THEN PULL AWAY TO THE NE. GFS 
INDICATES SOME DRYING ALOFT AND AT LOWER LEVELS OVER THE KEYS AS A 
RESULT OF OUTER EFFECTS OF THIS LOW. I WILL GO WITH 20 PCT POPS 
BASED ON EXTENDED GFS MOS.

A BROAD 1025 MB HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS SITUATED NEAR THE NORTH 
CAROLINA COAST...WITH ITS PERIPHERY SPREADING SOUTHWARD OVER 
FLORIDA. MEANWHILE...LOWER PRESSURES NEAR 1013 MB ARE LOCATED IN THE 
WESTERN CARIBBEAN. THE RESULTING PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THESE TWO 
AREAS COVERS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS...MAINTAINING 
FRESH TO STRONG EAST NORTHEASTERLY BREEZES...AVERAGING NEAR 15 MPH 
WITH INTERMITTENT GUSTS TO 20 TO 25 MPH ALONG THE ISLANDS...AND NEAR 
20 KT WITH GUSTS TO 25 TO 30 KT AT THE CMAN STATIONS ON THE REEF. 
THESE WINDS ARE PRODUCING WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS AS THEY BLOW OVER THE WARM FETCH OF THE CAYSAL BANK 
AND FLORIDA STRAITS. UNLIKE YESTERDAY...WINDS HAVE SHIFTED ENOUGH 
TOWARD EAST OVERNIGHT THAT THE SHOWERS HAVE BEEN PASSING OVER THE 
ISLANDS...PRODUCING SCATTERED COVERAGE OF MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION 
IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS...MAINLY IN THE MIDDLE KEYS.

.FORECAST...
SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LITTLE WILL CHANGE IN THE OVERALL 
WEATHER PATTERN TODAY AND TONIGHT. A LOW-LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE PASSING THROUGH THE EASTERN OHIO RIVER VALLEY INTO NEW 
ENGLAND WILL PUSH THE HIGH PRESSURE NEAR NORTH CAROLINA A BIT TO THE 
SOUTH...WITH THE RIDGE THEN STRETCHING FROM THE CAROLINAS TO ALABAMA 
AND MISSISSIPPI BY THURSDAY MORNING. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE 
KEYS WILL NOT BE NOTICEABLY CHANGED BY THIS SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF 
THE RIDGE...THUS WINDS WILL REMAIN NEAR 20 KT AND GUSTY OVER THE BAY 
AND GULF ZONES AND 20 TO 25 KT AND GUSTY OVER THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS...WITH A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY REMAINING IN EFFECT FOR ALL 
KEYS WATERS. HOWEVER...THE SOUTHWARD SHIFT OF THE RIDGE SHOULD BE 
ENOUGH TO NUDGE OUR WINDS A BIT BACK TOWARD NORTHEASTERLY 
TODAY...KEEPING THE SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER THE STRAITS SOUTH OF THE 
KEYS AGAIN. IN LIGHT OF THIS...AS WELL AS THE NORMAL DROP-OFF IN 
CONVECTIVE COVERAGE AFTER THE NOCTURNAL MAXIMUM IN THIS PATTERN...30 
POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.

EXTENDED (THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE AFOREMENTIONED LOW-LEVEL 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE PASSING THROUGH THE EASTERN OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
TODAY WILL STALL ALONG THE CAROLINA COASTS AND EASTERN GEORGIA BY 
FRIDAY...ERODING THE CURRENT RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IN THAT AREA. 
THIS WILL CAUSE THE PRESSURE GRADIENT AND THE WINDS TO GRADUALLY 
EASE IN OUR AREA...BUT STILL REMAIN FAIRLY STRONG. CONCURRENTLY...A 
500 MB LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE QUICKLY TOWARD NORTH CAROLINA 
ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...AND CAUSE DEEPENING OF SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE IN THAT AREA. THE EVOLUTION OF SUCH A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM...IF IT COMES INTO EXISTENCE...WILL HAVE EFFECTS ON OUR LOCAL 
WEATHER EARLY NEXT WEEK.

THE CURRENT FORECAST PACKAGE HANDLES THE SITUATION VERY WELL. 
NO CHANGES ARE EXPECTED AT THIS TIME BEYOND THE FIRST PERIOD...AND 
PERHAPS NOT EVEN THEN.

A 1025 MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTER HAD MOVED TO THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST 
AS OF 18Z (2 PM)...BUT REMAINED QUITE LARGE IN SIZED WITH ITS 
EXPANSIVE CIRCULATION EXTENDING WELL SOUTH OVER FLORIDA. PRESSURES 
REMAIN RELATIVELY LOWER OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN AS WELL (BELOW 
1012 MB SOUTH OF JAMAICA)...GIVING THE KEYS A NE TO E WIND FLOW 20 
KT OR STRONGER. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS THAT PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES OVER THE KEYS HAVE CREPT UP DURING THE DAY...AND THIS IS MOST 
LIKELY DUE TO HIGHER MOISTURE CONTENT IN LAYERS FROM THE SURFACE UP 
TO 10 THSD FT. VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS SHORT CUMULUS LINES MOVING 
WSW WITH THE LOWER LEVEL FLOW...FROM THE BAHAMAS...OVER THE 
STRAITS...AND SCRAPING THE KEYS. INSTANTANEOUS RADAR COVERAGE OF 
SHOWERS WITHIN THESE LINES IS GENERALLY WIDELY SCATTERED TO 
ISOLATED...BUT THE FAST MOVEMENT OF SHOWERS CONTINUES TO SWEEP OUT A 
MORE SIGNIFICANT AREA AFFECTED BY SHORT-TERM RAINFALL. SHOWERS ARE 
PRODUCING GUSTS SOME 10-15 KT OVER GENERAL WIND SPEED. SAND KEY HAD 
A 35 KT GUST IN A SMALL SHOWER THIS AFTERNOON.

NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS.

TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A BREEZY PERIOD STILL IS IN STORE 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT (AND MAYBE INTO THURSDAY) ...ACCOMPANIED BY 
FAST MOVING SHOWERS AND PERHAPS A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL REMAIN OVER THE U.S. ATLANTIC COASTAL WATERS WHILE LOWER 
PRESSURE IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN AIDS IN MAINTAINING A PRESSURE 
GRADIENT OVER THE KEYS SIMILAR TO WHAT IS NOW IN PLACE. NOT MUCH IN 
THE WAY OF UPPER SUPPORT FOR SHOWERS IS SEEN...JUST LOW LEVEL 
MESOSCALE FORCING AND SOME ENHANCEMENT OF NOCTURNAL SHOWER 
DEVELOPMENT. 30 PCT POPS ARE CARRIED FOR EACH PERIOD.

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A 
GRADUAL...BUT SLIGHT...REDUCTION IN PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE 
REGION. THURSDAY MAY START OUT STILL BREEZY BEFORE WINDS DROP CLOSER

SHORT WAVE TROUGH DROPPING SSE OVER FLORIDA...AND THE GFS MODEL 
SHOWS SOME LOWER TO MID LEVEL LIFT DURING THURSDAY AND THURSDAY 
NIGHT. 40 PCT POPS ARE THEREFORE RETAINED. NE OR ENE FLOW MAY AID 
DAYTIME OVER-ISLAND SHOWER FORMATION AS WELL. 

SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS MODEL CONTINUES TO SHOW 
A PERSISTENT NE OR ENE WIND FLOW OVER THE KEYS. AND...THERE IS 
EVIDENCE OF ANOTHER SURGE IN HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE NORTH SETTING IN

A FRESH AND DEEP NORTHEAST FLOW PUSHING ACROSS VERY WARM ATLANTIC 
WATERS (MID 80S) IS GENERATING SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS...WITH A FEW SHOWERS PASSING ACROSS UPPER KEYS COMMUNITIES. 
ELSEWHERE...ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE PENETRATING INTO THE FLORIDA 
BAY...WITH NO ACTIVITY IN THE GULF WATERS. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS 
DEPICTS AN ELONGATED AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE (1025 MB) CENTERED OVER 
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA...WITH A BROAD TROUGH REACHING FROM THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS. THE PRESSURE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO FEATURES IS RESULTING IN NORTHEAST 
WINDS OF AROUND 20 KNOTS WITH GUSTS NEAR 30 KNOTS AT THE C-MAN 
STATION PLATFORMS. 

.FORECAST...(TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)
A BROAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING FROM JUST OFFSHORE OF 
THE MID ATLANTIC COAST...SOUTHWARD INTO THE BAHAMAS WILL SUPPORT A 
BROAD SURFACE TROUGH TO LINGER OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 
MEANWHILE...A SURFACE ANTICYCLONE OVER THE MID ATLANTIC COAST AND 
WESTERN ATLANTIC TODAY...WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN AND SHIFT EASTWARD AS 
A COLD FRONT DROPS SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE MID ATLANTIC COAST BY LATE 
THURSDAY. THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE FORMER TWO SYSTEMS 
WILL RESULT IN FRESH NORTHEAST WINDS THROUGH AT LEAST WEDNESDAY. IN 
ADDITION...WITH A DEEP NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW...GFS FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS MAINTAIN PWAT VALUES OF AROUND 1.50 INCHES. GIVEN AMPLE 
MOISTURE AND CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY...LOW CHANCE POPS WILL BE KEPT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FOR THURSDAY...A MINOR MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
DISTURBANCE DROPPING DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA MAY PROVIDE WEAK 
UPWARD VERTICAL MOTION TO ENHANCE MESOSCALE BOUNDARIES. HENCE...40 
PERCENT POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED. 

EXTENDED(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)
THE AFOREMENTIONED BROAD SURFACE TROUGH WILL LINGER NEAR THE WESTERN 
BAHAMAS...AS ANOTHER AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES. DESPITE NO DISCERNIBLE SUBSIDENCE OR LARGE SCALE 
ASCENT APPARENT...PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WITHIN AN EASTERLY 
FLOW SHOULD GENERATE DIURNAL CLOUD LINES ALONG WITH SOME NOCTURNAL 
SHOWERS TO PUSH ACROSS THE ISLAND CHAIN. THEREFORE...SCATTERED POPS 
ALONG WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH THE 
PERIOD.

&&

.MARINE...
ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE OCCASIONAL...BRIEF AND SUBTLE WIND LULLS 
ON KEYS WATERS...MOSTLY NORTHEAST WINDS OF NEAR 20 KNOTS WILL 
PERSIST THROUGH AT LEAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HENCE...A SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN IN EFFECT THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE

LATEST AVAILABLE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVERLAYED WITH STREAMLINE 
ANALYSIS DEPICTS A NARROW POSITIVELY TILTED TROUGH AXIS POSITIONED A 
FEW HUNDRED MILES EAST OF THE ENTIRE EASTERN SEABOARD. FARTHER TO 
THE WEST...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS APPARENT JUST WEST OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. TO THE SOUTH...THE CENTER OF A WARM CORE TROPICAL 
ANTICYCLONE REMAINS OVER CENTRAL AMERICA. THE FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN 
BENEATH VERY DRY AIR BETWEEN THE NORTHEAST EDGE OF THE 
AFOREMENTIONED LARGE SCALE ANTICYCLONE AND THE TROUGH AXIS JUST EAST 
OF FLORIDA.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...A 1025 MB PLUS 
CENTER OF HIGH PRESSURE IS LOCATED OVER THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. TO THE 
SOUTH...A WEAK WAVE IS MIGRATING WESTWARD ACROSS THE WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN SEA JUST WEST OF GRAND CAYMAN ISLAND. AS A RESULT...THE 
FLORIDA KEYS LIE BENEATH A MOIST LOWER AND MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE WITH 
FRESH TO STRONG SURFACE TO 20000 FEET NORTHEAST WIND FLOW. 

.CURRENTLY...THE LATEST EVENING SOUNDING (00Z) INDICATES A TYPICALLY 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...WITH AN ISOTHERMAL LAYER 
BETWEEN 750 AND 705 MB...AND PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) VALUES DOWN 
ANOTHER TENTH OF AN INCH LOWER IN 24 HOURS...NOW DOWN TO 1.51 
INCHES. TEMPERATURES ARE PRESENTLY IN THE LOWER 80S WITH DEWPOINT 
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 70S. SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. AT 900 
PM...KEY WEST RADAR IS DEPICTING A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS...WITH A CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS LOCATED WITHIN 20

OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH TOMORROW.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...THE 1025 MB 
CENTER OF THE LARGE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE NOW OVER THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS 
WILL SLIDE TO THE PIEDMONT OF NORTH CAROLINA BY TOMORROW. AT 
00Z...THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
ADJOINING WATERS DEPICTED SLIGHTLY HIGHER WIND VELOCITIES THEN WHEN 
COMPARED WITH THE 00Z NAM AND GFS MODEL INITIALIZATIONS. 

IN TERMS OF MOISTURE...SHOWER COVERAGE HAS INCREASED SLIGHTLY IN THE 
EASTERN STRAITS THIS EVENING...AND IS MOSTLY SCATTERED HERE. THERE 
HAVE BEEN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS PULSING UP DUE TO THE SUSTENANCE 
OF A FAIRLY MOIST...MODERATELY UNSTABLE AND WEAKLY CAPPED 
THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT WITHIN MUCH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 
TROPOSPHERE. THE LATEST AVAILABLE 18Z 12 HOUR GFS POP#S FOR THE

REASON TO DEVIATE FROM THE INHERITED LOW CHANCE POPS TONIGHT.

&&

.MARINE...AS SAID PREVIOUSLY...THINK THAT WINDSPEEDS COULD RUN A FEW 
KNOTS HIGHER THAN WE HAVE ACROSS ALL WATERS OVERNIGHT. DO NOT SEE 
THIS AS ENOUGH TO RAISE THE SUSTAINED WIND FORECAST TO BETWEEN 20

CRAFT ADVISORIES WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVERNIGHT AND TOMORROW. IN 
ADDITION...MARINERS MIGHT ENCOUNTER SOME WIND GUSTS BETWEEN 30 AND 
35 KNOTS IN SOME ISOLATED HEAVIER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. STAY

.DISCUSSION...
A 1025 TO 1026 MB HIGH PRESSURE CENTER REMAINED OVER WESTERN 
VIRGINIA AT 18Z (2 PM)...WITH A LARGE EXPANSE THAT EXTENDED WELL 
SOUTH OVER FLORIDA. THERE CONTINUED TO BE A SLIGHT SURGE OF PRESSURE 
AND HIGHER WIND EMBEDDED WITHIN THE OVERALL LARGE ANTICYCLONIC 
FLOW...AND THIS SURGE WAS ALONG A LINE EXTENDING SW OVER THE 
ATLANTIC TO NE FLORIDA. KEYS AREA WINDS ARE NE AS EXPECTED...BLOWING 
IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE WITH GUSTS OVER 20 KT. BAY AND GULF WINDS
HAVE COME UP INTO THE 15-20 KT RANGE FROM EARLIER MORNING WINDS 
CLOSER TO 15 KT. FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS AND TCU IN  SHORT LINES 
ALIGNED WITH THE WIND ARE SEEN ON SATELLITE...AND RADAR SHOWS SMALL 
SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TCUS. A BATCH OF SHOWERS THAT BLEW SW 
OFF THE CAPE SABLE AREA OF MAINLAND FLORIDA...ACTUALLY GREW TO HAVE 
TOPS OVER 30 THSD FT AS THEY PASSED NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. THIS IS 
SURPRISING DUE TO THE DRYNESS ABOVE 8 THSD FT STILL SHOWN BY GOES 
SOUNDER DATA. ALSO...SHOWERS FORMED INTO THUNDERSTORMS WITH 
LIGHTNING DETECTED THIS AFTERNOON SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST OF DRY 
TORTUGAS...WHERE MOISTURE OBVIOUSLY IS DEEPER. 

.FORECAST...
A PROLONGED PERIOD OF BREEZY CONDITIONS IS SEEN FOR THE KEYS...
AT LEAST THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. IN FACT...AFTER A VERY SLIGHT LULL 
IN NE TO E WIND SPEEDS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...EXTENDED MODELS SUGGEST 
A RE-BOOSTING OF NE-E WINDS SATURDAY AFTERNOON ON INTO NEXT WEEK. 
ALL THIS WHILE...NO SIGNIFICANT COOLING OR LOWERING OF SURFACE 
HUMIDITIES IS INDICATED...BUT QUICKLY PASSING SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE 
DUE TO LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE THROUGHOUT THE COMING WEEK. 

TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...A SLIGHT SURGE IN HIGH PRESSURE WORKING SOUTH 
OVER THE ATLANTIC OFF NE FLORIDA IS EXPECTED TO EXPAND GENERALLY 
SOUTHWARD OVER A LARGE AREA OVERNIGHT...THEREBY TIGHTENING THE 
PRESSURE GRADIENT A BIT FURTHER OVER THE KEYS. WIND DIRECTION OUGHT 
TO STAY GENERALLY NE. 30 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE CARRIED FOR 
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY BASED ON CURRENT FORECASTS...AND NEW GFS MODEL 
GUIDANCE. I WILL LEAVE IN MENTION OF THUNDER SIMPLY DUE TO THE QUICK 
APPEARANCE OF SOME HIGH TOPPED SHOWERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON. 

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...A CONTINUED TIGHT PRESSURE 
GRADIENT DUE IN PART TO HIGH PRESSURE ANCHORED OVER THE EASTERN U.S. 
BUT ALSO DUE TO GENERALIZED LOWERED PRESSURES OVER THE WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN (DOWN BY 2-4 MB). THEREFORE CONTINUED BREEZY TO MAYBE EVEN 
WINDY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED. CURRENT FORECASTS INDICATE 40 PCT 
CHANCE OF RAIN EACH 12 HOUR PERIOD. NO STRONG EVIDENCE IS SEEN IN 
CURRENT MODELS FOR MUCH MORE THAN QUICKLY PASSING SHOWERS. HOWEVER...
MODELS SHOW A SHORT WAVE TROUGH AT 500 MB MOVING SOUTH OVER FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS TROUGH...WHILE
DROPPING SOUTH ON THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF A 500 MB ANTICYCLONE... 
MAY PROVIDE SOME SLIGHT LARGE SCALE LIFT. GFS AND NAM MODELS SHOW A 
GRADUAL...BUT SLIGHT...SLACKENING OF PRESSURE GRADIENT DURING THU

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...AS STATED ABOVE...EXTENDED GFS MODEL SHOWS 
A RENEWED DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN STATES...
AND SUBSEQUENT RENEWAL OF NE BREEZINESS OVER THE KEYS.

.MARINE...
THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FLAG WILL GO UP THIS EVENING FOR KEYS

NEAR 20 KT OVER KEYS WATERS. THAT SLIGHT DROP IN WINDS THU INTO FRI
MAY ONLY AMOUNT TO WINDS COMING DOWN NEAR 15 KT. EXTENDED NUMERICAL 
WEATHER PROGS SUGGEST WINDS MAY COME UP AGAIN LATE SAT OR SAT NIGHT 
INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. ENJOY THE KEYS BREEZE BUT BEWARE THOSE ROUGH

PRESSURE EXTENDING FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST 
BAHAMAS. BETWEEN THESE TWO FEATURES...NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF 15 
TO 20 KNOTS ARE BEING FELT AT THE C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS. 
MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS...WITH NO ECHOES OVER THE GULF OR BAY WATERS. 

.FORECAST...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)
A LARGE MID AND UPPER LEVEL ANTICYCLONE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AND 
FLORIDA PENINSULA TODAY WILL GRADUALLY RETROGRADE WESTWARD...AS A 
BROAD TROUGH REMAINS JUST OFFSHORE OF THE EASTERN UNITED STATES AND 
BAHAMAS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MEANWHILE...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ALONG 
THE MID ATLANTIC COAST WILL SLOWLY RETREAT EASTWARD AND WEAKEN...AS 
A LENGTHY TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE STRETCHING FROM THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC AND BAHAMIAN CHAIN LINGERS. SUBSEQUENTLY...A DEEP AND 
STRENGTHENING NORTHEAST FLOW WILL PREDOMINATE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS. 

PRECIPITATION WISE...WITH THE INCREASING NORTHEAST FLOW...MOST  
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE STORMS THAT DEVELOP ON THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
MAINLAND SHOULD BE STEERED INTO THE GULF WATERS. OTHERWISE...FRESH 
TO OCCASIONALLY STRONG NORTHEAST WINDS PUSHING ACROSS VERY WARM 
ATLANTIC WATERS WILL PROVIDE SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE FLUX FOR 
GENERATING SCATTERED NOCTURNAL SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS.  
TRICKY PART BECOMES WHETHER THE NORTHEAST FLOW WILL VEER EASTERLY 
ENOUGH TO ALLOW CONVECTIVE CELLS TO MOVE ACROSS THE ISLAND CHAIN 
DURING THE NIGHT TIME. WITH THE UNCERTAINTY...LOW SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
CLIMO POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 

EXTENDED(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)
WITH A BLOCKED MID AND UPPER LEVEL SYNOPTIC PATTERN IN 
PLACE...ANOTHER SURFACE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE REINFORCED 
OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES AS A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE REMAINS 
OVER THE BAHAMAS. AMPLE MOISTURE AND CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY WITHIN 
A DEEP NORTHEAST FLOW WILL PROMPT SCATTERED POPS AND NEAR NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.MARINE...
NORTHEAST WINDS WILL EXPERIENCE A LULL THIS MORNING AND EARLY THIS 
AFTERNOON...BEFORE BECOMING FRESH LATE TODAY AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT. 
THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A FORMIDABLE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE

1000 PM EDT SUN OCT 1 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB). THE MAIN AXIS OF A 
FULL LATITUDINAL TROUGH IS NOW SITUATED FROM NEW ENGLAND SOUTHWARD 
TO THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. TO THE WEST...A SYNOPTIC SCALE WARM CORE 
CARIBBEAN ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED NEAR THE YUCATAN PENINSULA. WATER 
VAPOR IMAGERY AND ANALYSIS CONFIRMS THAT THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE 
BENEATH VERY DRY AIR BETWEEN THE NORTHEAST PERIPHERY OF THIS LARGE 
ANTICYCLONE...AND THE DEPARTING TROUGH TO THE EAST.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...THE CENTER OF A 
1022 MB PLUS HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS POSITIONED OVER THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. A COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST WESTWARD 
TO CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. SOUTH OF THAT...THE AXIS OF A TROPICAL WAVE 
IS NOW LOCATED NEAR EASTERN CUBA. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN A 
MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH AND MOIST NORTHEAST FLOW FROM THE 
SURFACE TO 10000 FEET.  


.CURRENTLY...BETWEEN 600 PM AND 630 PM...A NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST 
ORIENTED CLOUDLINE WAS RESPONSIBLE FOR SEVERAL BRIEF WATERSPOUTS 
DEVELOPING ACROSS THE NEARSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS... 
WITHIN 15 NM SOUTHEAST THRU SOUTH OF THE WEST END OF KEY WEST. THE 
LATEST EVENING SOUNDING (00Z)INDICATED A TYPICALLY MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...WITH AN ISOTHERMAL LAYER BETWEEN 750 
AND 720 MB...AND PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) VALUES ABOUT A TENTH OF 
AN INCH LOWER IN 24 HOURS...NOW DOWN TO 1.62 INCHES. TEMPERATURES 
ARE PRESENTLY IN THE LOWER 80S WITH DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES IN THE 
LOWER 70S. SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. AT 900 PM...KEY WEST RADAR IS 
STILL DEPICTING A FEW SHOWERS NORTH AND WEST OF THE LOWER 
KEYS...LEFTOVER FROM ACTIVITY WHICH MOVED SOUTHWEST FROM THE 
MAINLAND DURING THE LATER AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING HOURS. NORTHEAST 
WINDS OVER THE ISLANDS AND ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND FLORIDA BAY 
ARE INCREASING...WITH C-MAN STATIONS REGISTERING 10 METER WINDS NEAR 
15 KNOTS...GUSTING TO NEAR 20 KNOTS. 


.FORECASTS...IN THE UPPER LEVELS...(500 TO 200 MB)...TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW...WILL SEE A NEAR 590 DM 500 MB CENTER OF HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILD EASTWARD OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE KEYS. THE NET RESULT 
HERE WILL BE INCREASED DRYING AND WARMING OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 
ATMOSPHERE.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW...THE WAVE AXIS OVER EASTERN CUBA WILL SLIDE WESTWARD TO 
CENTRAL CUBA...AS THE 1020-1022 MB HIGH PRESSURE NOW CENTERED OVER 
THE APPALACHIANS WILL BUILD EASTWARD AND INCREASE JUST A FEW MORE 
MB. AS A RESULT...MODERATE TO FRESH BREEZES ARE EXPECTED OVER THE 
KEYS MARINE DISTRICT AND THE ISLANDS. SHOWER ACTIVITY TONIGHT SHOULD 
REMAIN JUST ISOLATED TONIGHT...BUT SLIGHTLY ENHANCED SYNOPTIC LIFT 
IN ASSOCIATION WITH A WAVE AXIS MOVING BY TO THE SOUTH...WILL RESULT 
IN JUST ABOVE NORMAL POPS TOMORROW.

&&

.MARINE...WINDS HAVE INCREASED TO BETWEEN 15 TO 20 KNOTS ALONG THE 
REEF...SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF LATEST MOS GUIDANCE #S FOR THE 18Z GFS...SO 
HAVE DECIDED TO GO AHEAD WITH A CAUTION HEADLINE FOR THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS TONIGHT. WILL LIKELY SEE CAUTION HEADLINES ON ALL WATERS 
TOMORROW. MODELS ALSO CONTINUE TO SHOW SMALL SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY 
CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY TOMORROW NIGHT...AND CONTINUING 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WITH THE ONSET OF HIGHER WINDS...SEAS WILL 
SLOWLY BUILD TO 5 TO 7 FEET OVER THE STRAITS AND 4 TO 6 FEET OVER 
GULF WATERS. STAY TUNED TO NOAA WEATHER RADIO FOR THE LATEST 
POSSIBLE MARINE WEATHER ADVISORIES FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE 
IN KEY WEST.

320 PM EDT SUN OCT 1 2006

.DISCUSSION...
THE BULK OF THE ACTIVITY ON KBYX RADAR TODAY HAS BEEN IN A RAGGED 
LINE JUST EAST OF THE UPPER KEYS TO THE WATERS WELL SOUTH OF DRY 
TORTUGAS. MORE RECENT ECHOES HAVE DEVELOPED JUST EAST OF MAINLAND 
MIAMI-DADE COUNTY...AND ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE MIAMI METRO 
AREA. ALL THE SHOWERS ARE MOVING TO THE SOUTHWEST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. 
OTHERWISE...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY AND TEMPERATURES HAVE CLIMBED 
INTO THE UPPER 80S. WINDS ARE LIGHT TO MODERATE OUT OF THE NORTHEAST.

.FORECAST...
THE TROUGH NEAR THE EASTERN COAST OF THE UNITED STAY WILL CONTINUE 
TO MOVE EASTWARD OVERNIGHT. A MID TO UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BUILD 
OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. CLOSER TO 
THE SURFACE...THE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST WILL BE 
REINFORCED AND POSITIONED FURTHER TO THE NORTHEAST DURING THE ENTIRE 
WEEK. FORECAST REASONING HAS NOT DEVIATED SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THIS 
AFTERNOONS ISSUANCE. BUT THERE ARE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS THAT WILL BE 
NECESSARY. LATEST RUNS CONTINUE TO SLOW THE TREND OF FRESHENING 
WINDS ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...AND OVERALL MOISTURE DEVIATES 
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK ON THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE EAST COAST 
RIDGE. SO...THE WIND GRIDS WILL BE ADJUSTED DOWNWARD THROUGH THE 
FIRST 2 PERIODS...BUT IT STILL LOOKS THAT BY LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON A 
BREEZY DESCRIPTOR SHOULD BE FINE. THE NAM MOS NUMBERS ARE QUITE LOW 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS FAR AS RAIN CHANCES ARE CONCERNED. THEY 
ARE LOW SINGLE DIGITS ALL THE WAY INTO TUESDAY AFTERNOON. GFS 
NUMBERS ARE A GOOD 30 PERCENT ABOVE THAT DURING THOSE PERIODS. EXACT 
TIMING OF MOSTLY SHORT-LIVED SHOWERS IS GOING TO BE HARD TO PIN DOWN 
THIS WEEK...AND HAVE LEFT A LOW RAIN CHANCE IN FOR MOST PERIODS. THE 
EXCEPTION WILL BE FOR TONIGHT. A FEW SHOWERS/TSTMS MAY CRUISE OFF 
THE SOUTHEAST MAINLAND AND THREATEN THE ISLAND CHAIN THIS 
EVENING...BUT I ONLY EXPECT A MINIMAL CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR THE 
OVERNIGHT PERIOD. IT NOW LOOKS AS THE WINDS MAY SLACKEN FOR THE LATE 
PORTION OF THE WORK WEEK AS A DYING FRONT WASHES OUT TO OUR NORTH 
AND EAST. LITTLE CHANGE IN DAY TO DAY TEMPERATURES.

&&

.MARINE...
NORTHEAST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS EXPECTED TONIGHT...AND THEN 15 TO 
20 KNOTS LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON. THE BEST LIKELIHOOD FOR SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY CONDITIONS SHOULD BE FROM MONDAY NIGHT INTO VERY EARLY 
THURSDAY...AND THEY MAY BE MARGINAL AS WELL. FOR THIS ISSUANCE... 
WILL KEEP WIND SPEEDS RIGHT AROUND 20 KNOTS FOR THOSE TIMES. WINDS 
SHOULD DECREASE LATE IN THE WEEK AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT GRADUALLY 
SLACKENS.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL OVER THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS 
WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 12Z. ISOLATED SHOWERS

.DISCUSSION...
SHOWERS THIS MORNING HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO A RAGGED LINE EXTENDING 
FROM JUST EAST OF THE UPPER KEYS...ALONG THE REEF...AND INTO THE 
WATERS WELL SOUTH OF DRY TORTUGAS. HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS ACROSS THE 
SOUTH AND SOUTHEASTERN STATES INTO THE ATLANTIC. WITH WEAKER AND 
BROAD PRESSURES TO OUR SOUTH...WINDS OUR LIGHT TO MODERATE OUT OF 
THE NORTH/NORHTEAST ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA AT THIS HOUR. 
TEMPERATURES ALREADY CLIMBING INTO THE MIDDLE 80S.

.FORECAST...
REGIONAL SOUNDINGS AND GOES SOUNDER IMAGES SHOW THAT THE LOCAL AREA 
IS FLANKED BY DRIER AIR TO OUR NORTHWEST AND DEEPER MOISTURE OFF TO 
THE SOUTHEAST. ALTHOUGH THERE IS THE LENGTHY STRETCH OF WEAK SHOWERS 
OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE ISLAND CHAIN AT THIS TIME...RAIN CHANCES 
MAY BE LIMITED OVERALL THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. THE CURRENT FORECAST 
IS LOW CHANCE...AND MAY IN FACT SEND A LATE MORNING UUPDATE TO 
REDUCE THAT TO A SLIGHT CHANCE. BUT WILL HOLD OFF A LITTLE LONGER TO 
SEE HOW THE PRESENT ACTIVITY BEHAVES. OTHERWISE...NO CHANGES ARE 
NECESSARY TO THE EARLY MORNING ISSUANCE.

&&

.MARINE...
BOATERS CAN EXPECT NORTHEAST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS THROUGH THE 
REMAINDER OF TODAY...WITH GRADUALLY INCREASING SPEEDS THROUGH THE 
DAY ON MONDAY. NO CHANGE WILL BE INCORPORATED INTO THE LATE MORNING 
MARINE UPDATE.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KMTH THROUGH AT LEAST THE NEXT 24 
HOURS. A CUMULUS CLOUD LINE MAY DEVELOP OVER THE LOWER KEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON. IF THIS CLOUD LINE SITS DIRECTLY OVER KEYW SOMETIME THIS 
AFTERNOON...IT COULD PRODUCE MVFR OR LOWER CONDITIONS FOR A PERIOD 
OF ABOUT AN HOUR OR SO. BE THAT AS IT MAY...THE CHANCE OF MVFR OR 
LOWER CONDITIONS AT KEYW THIS AFTERNOON IS TOO LOW TO WARRANT 
ANYTHING OTHER THAN VFR CONDITIONS IN THE KEYW TERMINAL FORECAST. 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE MVFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE TODAY INTO EARLY TONIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...A PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE GULF OF 
MEXICO...ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES...INTO THE ATLANTIC. A BROAD 
MID TO UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS IN THE PROCESS OF LIFTING 
NORTHEASTWARD. SURFACE WINDS HAVE BEEN MAINLY NORTHEAST AT 5 AND 10 
MPH OVER ISLAND LOCATIONS...AND 10 TO 15 KNOTS ALONG THE REEF. GPS 
SENSORS INDICATE A PWAT OF 1.5 OVER THE KEYS. SATELLITE DERIVED PWAT 
IMAGERY INDICATE THAT THE KEYS REMAIN ALONG THE NORTHWESTERN EDGE OF 
HIGHER TROPICAL MOISTURE OVER THE STRAITS. RADAR IMAGERY INDICATES 
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE EASTERN STRAITS. A FEW OF THESE SHOWERS 
HAVE CROSS OVER THE UPPER KEYS. CURRENTLY...TEMPERATURES ARE AROUND 
80 WITH DEW POINTS NEAR 70. 

.FORECAST...
HIGHER HEIGHTS IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS WILL BUILD QUICKLY 
NORTHEASTWARD BEHIND THE DEPARTING TROUGH. THE MID LEVEL RIDGE WILL 
BECOME ESTABLISHED OVER THE SOUTHEAST TODAY...AND REMAIN THERE 
THROUGH THE WEEK. THE SURFACE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL BECOME BETTER 
ORGANIZED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES...AND STRENGTHEN AS A COUPLE 
OF REINFORCING HIGHS BRIDGE OVER OLD FRONTAL TROUGHS.

FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT WINDS WILL CONTINUE NORTHEASTERLY AT 10 TO 15 
MPH. HIGH MOISTURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE STRAITS...BUT THERE WILL BE 
ENOUGH IN PLACE TO ALLOW AFTERNOON SEA BREEZE ACTIVITY OVER SOUTH 
FLORIDA. THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE STEERED TOWARDS THE KEYS ON THE DEEP 
NORTHEASTERLIES. 

ON MONDAY...THE KEYS WILL BEGIN TO FEEL THE EFFECTS OF THE 
STRENGTHENING HIGH TO OUR NORTH. WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE TO 
15 TO 20 MPH AND BECOME MORE EAST NORTHEASTERLY. THESE BREEZY 
CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEK. THIS WILL RESULT IN STRONG 
MOISTURE FLUX OVER 86 DEGREE WATER. POPS WILL REMAIN A CHANCE AT A 
MINIMUM AS A RESULT.

&&

.MARINE...
NORTHEAST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS EXPECTED TODAY AND TONIGHT. 
BUILDING HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH MAY REQUIRE A SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY MONDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING. WINDS WILL GENERALLY MEET SCA 
CRITERIA THROUGH THIS WEEK...WITH POSSIBLY A SLIGHT LULL THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY. WITH THE ONSET OF HIGHER WINDS...SEAS WILL SLOWLY BUILD 
TO 5 TO 7 FEET OVER THE STRAITS AND 4 TO 6 FEET OVER GULF WATERS.

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH THROUGH AT LEAST THE

SHORT-LIVED NATURE OF POSSIBLE MVFR CONDITIONS...ONLY VFR CONDITIONS 
WILL BE ADVERTISED IN THE KEYW AND KMTH TAFS.   

CIRCUMNAVIGABLE IFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED ALONG THE WATER PORTION 
(60SW KMIA-KEYW) OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE TODAY. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD INCREASE IN INTENSITY AND COVERAGE ALONG THE 
SOUTH FLORIDA SEA BREEZE FRONTS THIS AFTERNOON. BE THAT AS IT 
MAY...LESS THAN 25% OF THE MAINLAND PORTION (KMIA-60SW KMIA) OF THE

AN UPPER-AIR COMPOSITE ANALYSIS AT 00Z REVEALED A LONG WAVE TROUGH 
IN A NORTH-SOUTH ORIENTATION FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. A MID-TROPOSPHERIC SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
WAS EVIDENT IN GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL MOVING EAST THROUGH THE BASE 
OF THE LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO TOWARD SOUTH

OVERNIGHT...THE WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH ALOFT WITH 
LITTLE EFFECT. LITTLE CHANGE IS EXPECTED TO CURRENTLY OBSERVED 
THERMODYNAMIC AND LOW-LEVEL WIND PROFILES. THEREFORE...ONLY A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS EXPECTED...WITH PERHAPS A

DEGREE IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS OFF OF THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. 
RECENTLY...A THIN LINE EXTENDED ACROSS THE EXTREME LOWER KEYS AND 
INTO THE GULF WATERS. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WERE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE 
LARGER ATLANTIC SHOWERS EARLIER IN THE DAY. WINDS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY 
NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE SHOWER ACTIVITY...AND HAVE AVERAGED CLOSE TO 
10 MPH AT THE ISLAND SENSORS AND BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS AT THE CMAN

SUNDAY OR EARLY MONDAY MORNING. A SAGGING TROUGH WILL LINGER 
NEARBY...BETWEEN RIDGING WHICH WILL BE AMPLIFYING OVER THE CENTRAL 
PORTION OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH MID-WEEK AND A PERSISTENT CENTRAL 
ATLANTIC RIDGE. CLOSER TO THE SURFACE...A BUBBLING HIGH IN THE 
NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL BE REINFORCED FROM THE NORTH OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. BY THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK THIS HIGHS WILL HAVE 
A STRONG CENTER OVER THE NORTHERN CAROLINA COASTLINE. WITH WEAKER 
PRESSURE TAKING UP RESIDENCE IN THE CARIBBEAN...A STRENGTHENING 
PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL BECOME ESTABLISHED ACROSS FLORIDA...THE KEYS 
AND THE STRAITS FOR THIS WEEK. THE OVERALL FORECAST REASONING HAS 
NOT CHANGED MUCH FROM PREVIOUS SHIFTS. THE CHALLENGE FOR THIS 
FORECAST WILL CONTINUE TO BE HOW MUCH THE MOISTURE GRADIENT WAFFLES 
OVER THE LOCAL SERVICE AREA...AND THEN THE ONSET OF STORNGER WINDS 
AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT BECOMES ESTABLISHED OVER THE REGION. 
ALSO...THERE IS INDICATION THAT A POCKET OF DRIER AIR SINKS AROUND 
THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE STRENGTHENING EAST COAST HIGH...POINTING TO 
LOWER RAIN POSSIBILITIES FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. SINCE THERE IS 
REASONABLE AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS ON THIS LATEST 
RUN...WILL GO AHEAD AND TRIM THE GRID POPS BACK ABOUT 10 PERCENT ALL 
LOCATIONS FOR THOSE FEW PERIODS. LATEST GFS RUN IS ALSO INDICATING A 
DELAY IN THE ONSET OF FRESHENING BREEZES...HOLDING OFF UNTIL MONDAY 
FOR THE ONSET OF THOSE CONDITIONS ACROSS THE AREA. NAM IS FAIRLY 
CLOSE TO ITS PREVIOUS RUN AND HAS FRESH BREEZES AS EARLY AS SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. WILL TAKE A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD APPROACH
FOR NOW...WHICH WILL EQUATE TO A SMALL ADJUSTMENT IN THE WIND GRIDS 
THROUGH LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. BUT A BREEZY DESCRIPTOR SHOULD

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A SURFACE TROUGH STRETCHING OVER FLORIDA IS IN THE PROCESS OF 
LIFTING OUT NORTHEASTWARD. ALOFT...A BROAD LONG WAVE TROUGH IS 
SHIFTING EASTWARD OVER THE EASTERN U S. A SWATH OF LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IS DRAPED ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND STRAITS. THIS IS 
COLLOCATED WITH A NARROW ZONE OF WEAK CONVERGENCE BETWEEN THE 
LIFTING TROUGH AND THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WELL TO OUR EAST. WITHIN THIS 
AXIS...THE ATMOSPHERE IS CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE WITH AMPLE LOWER 
LEVEL MOISTURE. THIS PAST EVENINGS SOUNDING AND CURRENT GPS SENSORS 
INDICATE PWAT OF AROUND 2 INCHES. RECENT DOPPLER RADAR SHOW AN 
INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY ACROSS THE STRAITS. 
ISLAND LOCATIONS IN THE UPPER KEYS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED BY A FEW OF 
THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS.

.FORECAST...
THROUGH TODAY...THE TAIL END OF THE SURFACE TROUGH OVER FLORIDA WILL 
LIFT FURTHER NORTHEAST...AND ITS CONTRIBUTION TO THE LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE WILL SHIFT FURTHER OUT INTO THE STRAITS AND WEAKEN. 
THERE WILL REMAIN A CHANCE OF SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY 
EARLY. WILL KEEP 30 PERCENT POPS IN THE FORECAST. TONIGHT AND 
SATURDAY...A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVES ARE EXPECTED TO PUSH THROUGH THE 
EASTERN GULF INTO THE ATLANTIC. LOWER TROPOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL 
HAVE DECREASED SOMEWHAT BY THIS EVENING...AND GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO 
INDICATE ANY FORCING NEAR THE KEYS WILL BE OVER THE STRAITS...WHERE 
THE HIGHER MOISTURE POOL WILL BE LOCATED. CURRENT THINKING IS 
MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED TONIGHT...AND WILL MAINTAIN THE CURRENT 20 
PERCENT. SATURDAY...GUIDANCE IS CONSISTENTLY HIGHER WITH POPS. GFS 
INDICATES A LITTLE BIT OF PVA MOVING ACROSS THE AREA. MEANWHILE...A 
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM...BRIDGING OVER THE SERIES OF DISSIPATING COLD 
FRONTS...WILL SET UP OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES AND NORTHERN GULF. 
NORTHEAST WINDS NEAR 10 TO 15 MPH WILL DEVELOP...BRINGING INCREASED 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BACK ACROSS THE KEYS. NORTHEAST WINDS WILL BECOME 
MODERATE BREEZES BY SUNDAY. THIS WILL KEEP THE BAND OF HIGHER 
MOISTURE NEAR THE KEYS...JUSTIFYING AT LEAST NEAR NORMAL POPS.

IN THE MID RANGE...THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT MOVED INTO THE 
SOUTHEAST...WILL STRENGTHEN AND REMAIN GENERALLY STATIONARY. WINDS 
ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE FURTHER SUNDAY NIGHT. NORTHEAST WINDS OF AT 
LEAST 15 MPH CAN BE EXPECTED...THANKS TO THE STRONG PRESSURE 
GRADIENT OVER OUR AREA. THIS ALONG WITH CONTINUED HIGH MOISTURE IN 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER OVER WATERS IN THE UPPER 80S WILL MEAN EPISODES 
OF SCATTERED FAST MOVING SHOWERS. CURRENT FORECAST IS 
REASONABLE...NO CHANGES TO THE MID AND EXTENDED PERIODS.

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE NORTH TO NORTHEAST BREEZES WILL PREVAIL TODAY AND TONIGHT. ON 
SATURDAY...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN AS A RESULT OF HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVING IN TO THE GULF STATES. SATURDAY AND SATURDAY 
NIGHT...WINDS WILL BE A GENTLE TO MODERATE BREEZE. SUNDAY...MODERATE 
BREEZES WILL PREVAIL AS THE HIGH BEGINS STRENGTHENING...DRIVING A 
STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. A 
CAUTION OR EVEN SCA MAY BE REQUIRED DURING PERIODS FROM SUNDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH TUESDAY. AT THIS POINT IN TIME...WILL HOLD ON TO 15 KNOTS 
AND GUSTY FOR THIS PERIOD.

&&

.AVIATION...
A DISSIPATING TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE 
OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE KEYS TODAY AND TONIGHT. THIS TROUGH OF 
LOW PRESSURE SEPARATES A VERY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
PENINSULA FROM A VERY MOIST AIR MASS FROM THE KEYS SOUTHWARD. THE 
VERY DRY AIR MASS WILL SLOWLY WORK ITS WAY TO THE SOUTH TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. 

MOST OF THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH THE VERY MOIST 
AIR MASS SHOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF THE KEYS TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT A 
PASSING SHOWER OR STORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT AT KEYW AND KMTH TODAY. 
MOST LIKELY...ANY SHOWER OR STORM THAT DOES CLIP KEYW OR KMTH WILL 
ONLY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR MVFR CONDITIONS OF 30 MINUTES OR LESS. DUE 
TO THE SHORT-LIVED NATURE OF POSSIBLE MVFR CONDITIONS COUPLED WITH 
THE DIFFICULTY IN TIMING ANY SHORT-LIVED MVFR CONDITIONS...ONLY VFR

430 AM EDT THU SEP 28 2006

.DISCUSSION...
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS BROAD CYCLONIC 
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC FLOW ACROSS THE EASTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE UNITED 
STATES. A STRONG MID-TROPOSPHERIC SHORT WAVE TROUGH WAS EVIDENT IN 
GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGERY DIGGING ACROSS THE MID-MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER VALLEY...WHILE ANOTHER WEAKER VORTICITY LOBE WAS TRAVERSING 
PORTIONS OF THE SOUTHEAST AND NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. AT THE 
SURFACE...A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONG SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES EXTENDED FROM ONTARIO TO TEXAS. 
FARTHER SOUTH...A WEAK BAROCLINIC TROUGH...FORMERLY A COLD FRONT... 
HAS PUSHED SOUTH TO A POSITION EXTENDING FROM NEAR STUART ON THE 
EAST COAST OF FLORIDA...TO THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. A 
SURFACE DEWPOINT DISCONTINUITY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BOUNDARY... 
WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S AND 60S NORTH AND WEST OF THE BOUNDARY. 
BUOY 42003 IN THE GULF LOOP CURRENT RECENTLY REPORTED A DEWPOINT OF 
62F. 

CURRENTLY AROUND THE FLORIDA KEYS...WINDS ARE FROM THE SOUTH- 
SOUTHWEST NEAR 10KT...EXCEPT OUT AT THE DRY TORTUGAS AND AT BUOY 
42014...WHERE LIGHT AND VARIABLE BREEZES HAVE BEEN REPORTED. LATEST 
KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW ISOLATED SHOWERS NORTH AND WEST OF 
A LINE FROM EAST CAPE SABLE...TO KEY WEST...TO 60 NAUTICAL MILES 
SOUTH OF DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. THE SHOWERS WERE MOVING SLOWLY 
NORTHEASTWARD...AND WERE ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK LOW-LEVEL CONFLUENT 
ZONE AND DEEPER MOISTURE. 

FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...IT LOOKS LIKE THE ZONE OF DEEPER MOISTURE 
CURRENTLY LOCATED JUST NORTH AND WEST OF THE SERVICE AREA WILL MOVE 
EASTWARD...PROVIDING FOR A HIGHER CHANCE OF RAIN THAN WE HAVE SEEN 
IN SEVERAL DAYS. THE MID-LEVEL CYCLONIC VORTICITY LOBE CURRENTLY 
OVER THE NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO IS EXPECTED TO MOVE 
SOUTHEASTWARD...PERHAPS PROVIDING WEAK ASCENT ON THE SYNOPTIC SCALE 
TO THE AREA LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

THE LONG WAVE TROUGH WHICH IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES WILL REACH ITS GREATEST AMPLITUDE ON FRIDAY. AS A 
RESULT...925-500MB NORTHWEST WINDS MAY REACH FAR ENOUGH SOUTH TO 
PUSH A VERY DRY AIR MASS OF MIDLATITUDE ORIGIN JUST PAST THE KEYS. 
ALTHOUGH SURFACE TEMPERATURE/HUMIDITY WILL NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY 
DUE TO RAPID FRONTOLYSIS NORTH OF THE KEYS...SKIES MAY CLEAR FOR A 
24-HOUR PERIOD BETWEEN FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH SHOWERS LIMITED TO 
THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA. IT WILL JUST DEPEND ON EXACTLY HOW FAR SOUTH 
THE DRY AIR ALOFT IS TRANSPORTED. 

BY SATURDAY...THE MIDLATITUDE UPPER FLOW PATTERN WILL CHANGE RAPIDLY 
BACK TO A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WITH RIDGING OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED 
STATES. DEEPER MOISTURE WILL BE POISED TO PUSH BACK OVER THE KEYS 
FROM THE SOUTHEAST AS THE WESTERLIES RETREAT NORTHWARD AND AN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE TO THE EAST GROWS IN SIZE AND INFLUENCE. AT THE 
SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING WILL BECOME ESTABLISHED OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES WHILE PRESSURES REMAIN LOW IN THE 
NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN. THIS WILL ALLOW NORTHEAST BREEZES TO FRESHEN.

FINALLY...DURING THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK...IT LOOKS INCREASINGLY 
LIKELY THAT RISING PRESSURES ACROSS THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND FALLING 
PRESSURES OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN WILL ALLOW FURTHER 
STRENGTHENING OF NORTHEAST WINDS...WITH FRESH TO STRONG BREEZES 
POSSIBLE MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. SEA SURFACE TEMPERATURES ARE STILL 
VERY HIGH OVER WATERS SURROUNDING THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND 
BAHAMAS...AND GREATER MOMENTUM IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL RAPIDLY 
MOISTEN THE SUBCLOUD LAYER...INCREASING BUOYANCY...AND DECREASING 
CONVECTIVE INHIBITION. SO...WE COULD SEE HIGHER RAIN CHANCES WITH 
SCATTERED FAST-MOVING SHOWERS IN SWIFT NORTHEASTERLY FLOW. FOR THIS 
REASON...WE HAVE INCREASED RAIN CHANCES FOR THE MONDAY-WEDNESDAY 
PERIOD.
&&

.MARINE...
VARIABLE BREEZES WILL PERSIST FOR ANOTHER DAY...BEFORE BECOMING 
MAINLY NORTH ON FRIDAY AND NORTHEAST ON SATURDAY. BREEZES WILL 
FRESHEN SIGNIFICANTLY BY LATE SUNDAY...WITH 15-20KT POSSIBLE BY LATE 
MONDAY. 20-KNOTTERS ARE NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION FOR EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...SO CHECK FORECASTS REGULARLY FOR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS OR 
ADVISORIES.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. A SURFACE FRONT WILL REMAIN JUST 
NORTH OF THE FLIGHT ROUTE. AS A RESULT...ISOLATED SHOWER AND STORM 
COVERAGE OVER THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE...WILL INCREASE TO 
SCATTERED BY AFTERNOON. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE POSSIBLE 
OVER THE ISLAND TERMINALS. THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL PRODUCE 
BRIEF MVFR/IFR CIGS AND/OR VIS. MOSTLY LIGHT SOUTHWEST TO NORTHWEST 
WINDS ARE EXPECTED AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS.

.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE IS SLOWLY WEAKENING OVER CENTRAL AND 
SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE WEAK CONVERGENCE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TROUGH...AND ARE CURRENTLY DEPICTED BY KBYX 
RADAR STRETCHING FROM AROUND LAKE OKEECHOBEE TO NEAR THE DRY 
TORTUGAS AND SOUTHWEST INTO THE EXTREME SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
MEANWHILE...OVER THE KEYS AND ATLANTIC WATERS SKIES ARE MOSTLY 
CLEAR...IN FACT OTHER THAN SOME THIN CIRRUS THERE IS HARDLY A CLOUD 
IN THE SKY ALONG THE ISLANDS AND OVER THE STRAITS TO THE SOUTH. 
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATES DRY AIR IN THIS AREA...AND SURFACE 
DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE LOW 70S WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR 90. WINDS HAVE 
BEEN MAINLY SOUTHWEST TODAY AT 5 TO MPH ON LAND AND 5 TO 10 KT ON 
THE WATER.

.FORECAST...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW NIGHT)...
THE WEAK TROUGH WILL REMAIN JUST NORTH AND NORTHWEST OF THE KEYS 
OVERNIGHT...MAINTAINING LIGHT SOUTHWEST TO WESTERLY BREEZES AND 
ISOLATED SHOWERS. WHILE COVERAGE MAY BE A BIT HIGHER NORTHWEST OF 
DRY TORTUGAS AND IN THE NORTHERN GULF ZONES...COVERAGE SHOULD 
DIMINISH OVERNIGHT AND THESE AREAS WILL AVERAGE ONLY ISOLATED 
CONVECTION. TOMORROW MORNING WEAK HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN 
GULF WILL SHIFT WINDS TO MORE NORTHWESTERLY...POTENTIALLY BRINGING 
THE REMNANTS OF THE TROUGH THROUGH OUR AREA. HOWEVER...THE FEATURE 
WILL HAVE WASHED OUT CONSIDERABLY BY THEN...AND THE ONLY NOTICEABLE 
EFFECTS WILL BE SHIFTING (BUT LIGHT) WINDS AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
(SCATTERED) COVERAGE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS. WINDS WILL CONTINUE 
TO SHIFT TO AROUND NORTH BY EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...BUT SPEEDS WILL 
REMAIN LIGHT AT LESS THAN 10 KT ON THE WATER AND LESS THAN 10 MPH ON 
LAND.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
IN THE MID-LEVELS...A DEEP TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL SWING ACROSS 
THE EASTERN U.S. THURSDAY AND FRIDAY THEN MOVE AWAY AS RIDGING 
BUILDS IN ITS WAKE. IN RESPONSE...A LOW-LEVEL AND SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE AREA WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN AND EASTERN U.S. BY 
FRIDAY NIGHT...SHIFTING OUR WINDS AROUND TO NORTHEAST. THEREAFTER 
THIS HIGH PRESSURE WILL STRENGTHEN...AND THE GRADIENT BETWEEN IT AND 
LOWER PRESSURES IN THE CARIBBEAN WILL CAUSE WINDS TO INCREASE ACROSS 
SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS BY LATE SUNDAY AND PERSIST THROUGH THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. THE NORTHEASTERLY FLOW WILL ALLOW MORE AMPLE 
MOISTURE TO RETURN TO THE AREA AND POPS WILL RETURN TO HIGHER LEVELS 
AROUND 30 PERCENT NEXT WEEK WITH NEAR CLIMO TEMPS.

NORTHEASTERLY AND STRENGTHEN TO A MODERATE BREEZE FROM LATE SUNDAY 
WELL INTO NEXT WEEK. NO CAUTIONARY HEADLINES ARE ANTICIPATED AT THIS 
TIME.

A SUPPRESSED CONVECTIVE REGIME REMAINS IN PLACE ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS THANKS IN LARGE PART TO A 1000-FT THICK 
LAYER OF VERY DRY AND STABLE AIR FROM 3000-4000FT AGL. VERY WEAK 
BOUNDARY LAYER MOMENTUM AND ASSOCIATED TURBULENT MIXING HAVE 
PREVENTED ANY SIGNIFICANT UPWARD FLUXES OF HEAT OR MOISTURE FROM SEA 
SURFACES WHICH ARE AVERAGING 86-87F. AS A RESULT...SURFACE DEWPOINT 
TEMPERATURES HAVE NOT BEEN ABLE TO RISE MUCH ABOVE 70F. THIS IS 
LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF MOIST STATIC ENERGY AVAILABLE FOR RISING 
PARCELS WHICH IN TURN ARE RUNNING INTO SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE 
INHIBITION AND DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT ALOFT. THE RESULT IS A RAIN-FREE 
CONDITION ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS. THIS REGIME SHOULD PERSIST INTO 
AT LEAST THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS...AND WILL BE SLOW TO CHANGE DUE 
TO A CONTINUED WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN AND LIGHT WINDS IN THE LOW 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE.

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS THE KEYS IN A 
DEEP LAYERED COL REGION BETWEEN TWO LARGE SUBTROPICAL ANTICYCLONES 
OVER MEXICO AND THE ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE WEST AND EAST...AND 
BETWEEN THE MIDLATITUDE WESTERLIES AND TRADE EASTERLIES TO THE NORTH 
AND SOUTH. A VERY WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN IS EVIDENT AT THE SURFACE 
WITH LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS OVER THE SURFACE AREA. THIS PATTERN 
WILL CHANGE SLOWLY OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS. HOWEVER...BY FRIDAY 
MORNING...A COUPLE OF POTENT MID-LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGHS DIGGING 
ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WILL ASSIST IN THE EVOLUTION OF A 
LONG WAVE TROUGH WHICH WILL EXTEND FROM ONTARIO TO THE SOUTHERN GULF 
OF MEXICO. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE OFF THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD...WITH THE SOUTHERN PORTION DYING RAPIDLY OVER THE WARM 
WATERS IN THE GULF BASIN AND SURROUNDING THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. A 
CONTINENTAL HIGH PRESSURE CELL MOVING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN STATES 
WILL TURN LIGHT AND VARIABLE BREEZES OVER THE KEYS TO LIGHT 
NORTHERLY. OVER THE WEEKEND...A MORE PROGRESSIVE UPPER-AIR PATTERN 
WILL EVOLVE OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN UNITED STATES...AS ZONAL 
FLOW QUICKLY REPLACES THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EAST WITH AN UPPER 
RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.

BY MONDAY...UPPER RIDGING WILL LEAD TO THE STRENGTHENING OF A LARGE 
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE EAST WHILE PRESSURES LOWER IN THE WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN BASIN. THE RESULTING FRESHENING NORTHEAST BREEZES AND 
STRENGTHENING BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW OVER THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WARM 
WATERS WILL LEAD TO DESTABILIZATION OF THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE AND 
HIGHER RAIN CHANCES.
&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT AND VARIABLE BREEZES WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THURSDAY...WITH 
LIGHT TO GENTLE NORTH BREEZES DEVELOPING THURSDAY NIGHT OR FRIDAY.

LIKELY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. WINDS NEAR OR IN EXCESS OF 15KT ARE 
POSSIBLE BY MONDAY OR TUESDAY.

A SUPPRESSED CONVECTIVE REGIME PREVAILS ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS 
EARLY THIS MORNING DUE IN PART TO DRY AIR EXTENDING INTO THE LOW

PRESENT IN THE MEAN LOWER TROPOSPHERE...AN INVERSION LAYER NEAR

KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE OFFSHORE WATERS WEST OF THE 
LOWER KEYS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE 
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE 
MOSTLY CLEAR. WINDS OVER LAND ARE EAST TO SOUTHEAST NEAR 5 MPH. 
C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE EAST TO SOUTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. ONLY ABOUT FOUR DEGREES OF 
COOLING IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT DUE TO LIGHT EAST TO SOUTHEAST SURFACE 
WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...THE WESTERN EXTENT OF 
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED NEAR THE BAHAMAS 
TONIGHT. FARTHER NORTH...IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS NORTH 
FLORIDA TONIGHT. IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF 
LOW PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO 
TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE...WITH A PRECIPITABLE 
WATER (PWAT) VALUE JUST UNDER ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH. 
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD DECREASE A BIT TONIGHT. BY SUNRISE 
TUESDAY...PWAT VALUES WILL BE JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN 
INCH. LACK OF OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES IN THE SERVICE AREA...LIGHT 
WINDS...AND LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT SHOULD LIMIT POPS TO 10 PERCENT 
AT BEST TONIGHT...WHICH IS WELL BELOW NORMAL AND NEAR ALL NUMERICAL 
OUTPUT STATISTICS. THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS 
HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...SO NO UPDATES ARE EXPECTED.  

&&

.MARINE...
EAST TO SOUTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OF LESS THAN 10 KNOTS SHOULD PREVAIL 
ON ALL KEYS WATERS TONIGHT. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS 
EXPECTED TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY.

BOARD. TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THIS...AN ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS 
OVER THE BAHAMAS. ALOFT...A WEAK MID AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS 
IN PLACE OVER FLORIDA. WIND SPEEDS ACROSS THE KEYS HAVE BEEN EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. SATELLITE AND GPS DERIVED PWATS INDICATE 
AROUND 1 AND 1.5 INCHES ACROSS THE KEYS. THIS FAIRLY DRY AND WEAK 
LOW LEVEL FLOW CONTINUES TO PREVENT SHOWERS FROM DEVELOPING ANYWHERE 
NEAR THE KEYS. EVEN CUMULUS ALONG THE SOUTH FLORID SEA BREEZES ARE 
STRUGGLING TO DEVELOP.

.FORECAST...
THE WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN WILL CONTINUE WEAKING OVERNIGHT. THE DYING 
TAIL ENDS OF A COUPLE OF COLD FRONTS WILL PUSH THROUGH CENTRAL 
FLORIDA AND STALL IN SOUTH FLORIDA. THE FIRST FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH 
OF THE LAKE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND THE NEXT ONE ON FRIDAY. AS A 
RESULT THE ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE WILL REMAIN EAST OF THE 
KEYS...AND THE KEYS WILL REMAIN IN A FEEBLE PRESSURE PATTERN INTO 
FRIDAY. THEN...A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BRIDGE ACROSS THE REMAINS 
OF THE SECOND FRONT AND TIGHTEN PRESSURE GRADIENT. A PREVAILING 
GENTLE TO MODERATE NORTH TO NORTHEAST WIND WILL DEVELOP IN REPSONSE.

FOR TONIGHT WINDS WILL BE MAINLY SOUTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH...BECOMING 
MORE VARIABLE. LOWER TROPOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL REMAIN LIMITED 
OVERNIGHT. WEAK FLOW AND LOW MOISTURE WILL KEEP POPS AT 10 PERCENT.

MOISTURE WILL INCREASE SLIGHTLY TOMORROW. CONTINUED LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE CONDITIONS WILL MEAN THAT MESOSCALE FEATURES SUCH AS CLOUD 
LINES AND BOUNDARY INTERACTIONS WILL DOMINATE. AS A RESULT...WILL 
GRADUALLY INCREASE POPS TO 30 PERCENT BY WEDNESDAY.

GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT THE BAND OF INCREASED MOISTURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMAINS OF THE SECOND FRONT WILL NOT REACH THE 
KEYS AREA UNTIL AROUND FRIDAY. WILL MAINTAIN 30 PERCENT FOR THIS 
PERIOD FOR NOW.

&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN WILL DOMINATE THE KEYS AREA INTO 
FRIDAY...RESULTING IN WINDS BECOMING LIGHT AND VARIABLE TONIGHT. 
FRIDAY A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE EASTERN STATES 
DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THIS WEEK...TIGHTENING THE LOCAL PRESSURE 
GRADIENT. GENTLE TO MODERATE NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS WILL DEVELOP 
ACROSS OUR AREA FRIDAY AND INTO THIS WEEKEND.

&&

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE PARTLY CLOUDY THIS MORNING IN THE KEYS. TEMPERATURES WERE 
IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 80S WITH LIGHT EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS. RADAR 
SHOWED ISOLATED SHOWERS IN OUR GULF WATERS AND IN THE WESTERN 
STRAITS. A SHIP REPORTED 17 KNOTS FROM THE EAST AT 06Z 36 MILES 
SOUTH OF TORTUGAS LIGHT...EVIDENTLY OUTFLOW IN THE VICINITY OF ONE 
OF THOSE WEAK SHOWERS. OUR EVENING SOUNDING SHOWED STABLE VERY DRY 
AIR ABOVE ABOUT 700 MB...AND THIS WAS WELL-DEPICTED ON WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE SHOWERS IN THE GULF EXIST ALONG A RELICT WIND SURGE LINE...AND 
ARE HAVING TROUBLE MAINTAINING THEMSELVES -- COVERAGE AND INTENSITY 
ARE MINIMAL. THE ATLANTIC HIGH IS STILL PRESENT BUT WEAKENING. THE 
LOW COLUMN MOISTURE AND HIGH VALUES OF STATIC STABILITY DIAGNOSE 
SINKING DUE TO RIDGING ALOFT IN OUR VICINITY.   
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE SINKING AND DRYING WILL KEEP CLOUDS AND SHOWERS AT BAY TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. WHILE THE MEAN FLOW WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR A CLOUD LINE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...LEADING TO OUR NON-ZERO POPS...WE EXPECT 
MEASURABLE RAIN WILL NOT BE OBSERVED. 

THE REST OF THE FORECAST IS PREDOMINATED BY CONSIDERATIONS RELATING 
TO THE APPROACH OF A WEAK COOL FRONT OR WIND SHIFT LINE. TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY THIS FEATURE WILL BE NEARBY BUT TO OUR NORTH. THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY IT WASHES OUT BUT OUR WINDS SHIFT ANYWAY AS HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. 

IT IS TOO EARLY IN THE SEASON TO EXPECT MUCH WITH THESE SYSTEMS -- 
WE HAD ONE LAST WEEK WHICH DID MOSTLY NOTHING. HOWEVER IT SHOULD BE 
ENOUGH TO PUT AN END TO THE SINKING AIR AND JUSTIFIES A RETURN TO 
MORE NORMAL OR SEASONABLE RAIN CHANCES FOR THE BALANCE OF THE SEVEN 
DAY FORECAST.

A WESTERN ATLANTIC LOWER TROPOSPHERIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS 
FLORIDA INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. IN RESPONSE...SURFACE WINDS 
ACROSS THE KEYS HAVE BEEN MAINLY EAST SOUTHEAST AT 5 T0 10 MPH. 
MARINE LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTING MOSTLY 10 TO 15 KNOTS. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES A NARROW CLOUD LINE ALIGNED CROSS 
GRADIENT...OVER THE STRAITS. A QUICKSCAT PASS THIS MORNING INDICATED 
THAT THERE MAY BE SUBTLE WIND SURGE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LINE. A FEW 
SHOWERS ARE LOCATED ALONG THIS LINE. HOWEVER...DRY AIR ALOFT IS 
PREVENTING SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT OF THESE SHOWERS. 

.FORECAST...
THROUGH THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL SHIFT 
EASTWARDS...AND AWAY FROM THE KEYS. THIS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO 
EASTWARD MIGRATION OF A MIDLATITUDE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED 
STATES. TONIGHT...EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS WILL 
CONTINUE. WILL MAINTAIN THE ONGOING 20 POP FOR TONIGHT...DUE TO THE 
WESTWARD MIGRATION OF THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED CLOUD LINE OVER THE

WILL AMPLIFY THE DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES. WHILE NO 
SURFACE TROUGHS OR FRONTS ARE EXPECTED TO REACH THE KEYS...THE 
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK WILL BE DOMINATED BY A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN. 
WINDS SHOULD BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE ON TUESDAY. ALSO...LOWER

PERCENT POPS THROUGH THIS PERIOD. A DISCERNIBLE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS 
NOT EXPECTED TO RETURN OVER THE KEYS UNTIL THIS WEEKEND.

EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS WILL REMAIN ACROSS KEYS

BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE...AND REMAIN SO THROUGH AT LEAST FRIDAY. 
NO CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS OR ADVISORIES WILL BE REQUIRED. 

&&

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AN ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS LOCATED NEAR BERMUDA. A RIDGE 
EXTENDS SOUTHWESTWARD...ACROSS FLORIDA...AND INTO THE GULF OF 
MEXICO. THIS RIDGE IS DRIVING MAINLY EAST WINDS AT AROUND 10 MPH 
ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. GPS SENSORS INDICATE PWAT 
LEVELS ACROSS THE KEYS RANGE FROM AROUND 1 TO 1.5 INCHES. WEAKER 
SLIGHTLY DIVERGENT SURFACE FLOW...AND A DRIER LOWER TROP HAS LIMITED 
SHOWER ACTIVITY. THE ONLY SHOWERS IN OUR WATERS DETECTED BY RADAR 
ALL DAY HAVE BEEN FOUND OVER OUR OUTER SOUTHWESTERN WATERS. EVEN 
SOUTH FLORIDA HAS BEEN SHOWER FREE.

.FORECAST...
THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL BECOME MORE ZONAL IN 
ORIENTATION THIS WEEKEND...REMAINING TO OUR NORTH. WINDS THROUGH 
TOMORROW WILL REMAIN AT ABOUT THE CURRENT VELOCITIES...WITH POSSIBLE 
SLIGHT SURGES DURING THE NIGHT TIME. THE SWATH OF DRIER LOWER 
TROPOSPHERIC AIR MOVING THROUGH THE KEYS WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPRESS 
SHOWER ACTIVITY OVERNIGHT. POPS WILL REMAIN IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE 
RANGE THROUGH THIS WEEKEND DUE TO BELOW NORMAL MOISTURE AND A 
WEAKENING SURFACE FLOW. 

THEN...A MID LATITUDE LOW SHIFTING QUICKLY EASTWARD OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION...WILL PUSH A SURFACE TROUGH INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN 
STATES. IN RESPONSE THE LOWER TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE WILL RETREAT 
EASTWARD...LEAVING THE KEYS IN A WEAKER PRESSURE PATTERN. THROUGH 
MUCH OF NEXT WEEK...LIGHT MAINLY EASTERLY WINDS WILL PREVAIL. THIS 
WEAK FLOW SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME ISLAND CU DEVELOPMENT AND BOUNDARY 
INTERACTIONS. WILL HOLD ON TO LOW CHANCE POPS THROUGH THIS PERIOD.

&&

.MARINE...
ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE WILL PROVIDE GENTLE TO MODERATE BREEZES WILL 
PERSIST ACROSS KEYS WATERS THROUGH THIS WEEKEND. THE RIDGE WILL  
SHIFT SOUTHWARD AND WEAKEN DURING THE FIRST COUPLE OF DAYS OF NEXT 
WEEK. AS A RESULT...SURFACE WIND WILL WEAKEN TO LIGHT TO GENTLE.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AND

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AN ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS LOCATED NEAR BERMUDA. A RIDGE 
EXTENDS SOUTHWESTWARD...ACROSS FLORIDA...AND INTO THE GULF OF 
MEXICO. A HEALTHY PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE KEYS AREA IS 
PRODUCING 10 TO 15 MPH EASTERLY WINDS ACROSS OUR AREA. THIS DEEP 
EASTERLY FLOW IS BRINGING IN MUCH DRIER AIR OVER OUR AREA. THIS 
MORNINGS SOUNDING INDICATED ONLY .91 INCHES PWAT AT MIAMI...AND 1.81 
AT KEY WEST. DEW POINTS ARE ALSO REFLECTING THIS MOISTURE GRADIENT. 
SOUTH FLORIDA AVERAGES DEW POINTS IN THE MID 60S...WHILE THE MIDDLE 
AND LOWER KEYS INDICATE AROUND 70 DEGREES. A WIND SURGE BOUNDARY IS 
LOCATED OVER OUR SOUTHWESTERNMOST WATERS. SHOWERS HAVE BEEN LOCATED 
ALONG THIS BOUNDARY...ASSISTED BY STILL HIGH LOWER TROP MOISTURE AND 
A TINY UPPER LEVEL LOW SITUATED JUST NORTH OF THE YUCATAN. 
ELSEWHERE...SHOWER ACTIVITY IS NO EXISTENT.


.SHORT TERM UPDATE (THIS AFTERNOON)...
DRIER AIR IS MOVING IN ON THE EASTERLY FLOW. THE FALLING DEW POINT 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD LIMIT THE CHANCE OF SHOWER ACTIVITY TODAY. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL MANAGE NEAR 90 UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES 
AND A MODERATE WIND OVER WARM WATER. NO CHANGES EXPECTED FOR THE 
MORNING UPDATE.

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE TO MODERATE BREEZES WILL PERSIST ACROSS KEYS WATERS THROUGH 
THE REMAINDER OF TODAY. ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED IN A 
DRYING LOWER ATMOSPHERE. WILL ONLY REMOVE TRANSITIONAL WORDING IN 
MORNING MARINE UPDATE.

A MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH EASTERLY 
WIND EARLY THIS MORNING WILL BECOME GENTLE TO MODERATE THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND PERSIST THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. WINDS WILL DECREASE 
SIGNIFICANTLY BY LATE MONDAY...WITH LIGHT WINDS EXPECTED MOST OF 
NEXT WEEK. 

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AND

GOES-12 WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A DISCERNIBLE UPPER LEVEL LOW 
CENTERED JUST NORTH OF THE YUCATAN CHANNEL...WITH A LARGE 
ANTICYCLONE ACCOMPANIED BY CONSIDERABLE DRY AIR CENTERED JUST 
OFFSHORE OF THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES COAST AND THE EASTERN HALF 
OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. MEANWHILE...THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS 
DEPICTS A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE STRETCHING ACROSS THE GULF COAST 
AREA...WITH AN ELONGATED AREA OF LOW PRESSURE REACHING FROM THE 
UPPER GREAT PLAINS INTO WESTERN TEXAS. THE COMBINATION OF LOW LEVEL 
SPEED CONFLUENCE AND UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE IS RESULTING IN 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST GULF 
OF MEXICO...BUT WITH NO SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION OVER THE FLORIDA 
KEYS AND SOUTHWARD. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION 
PLATFORMS INDICATE EAST WINDS OF AROUND 15 KNOTS WITH GUSTS OF 
AROUND 20 KNOTS. 

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
A ROBUST AND DEEP LAYERED (1000-500 MB) ANTICYCLONE CENTERED JUST 
OFFSHORE OF THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL SLOWLY RETREAT EASTWARD 
AND ERODE...AS A DEEPENING CYCLONIC FLOW SETS UP OVER THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES BY MONDAY. WITH THE PROGRESSIVE AND AMPLIFIED FLOW 
ALOFT...A WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDING ACROSS THE GULF 
COAST TODAY...WILL SLOWLY SETTLE INTO SOUTH FLORIDA AND WEAKEN 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY. BECAUSE OF THE DEEP ANTICYCLONIC FLOW...MUCH 
DRIER AIR WILL LIMIT DEEP CONVECTION THROUGH TONIGHT...BEFORE 
ADDITIONAL MOISTURE AND A SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE WIND PROFILE RETURNS 
LATE SUNDAY. SUBSEQUENTLY...ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS (10 PERCENT POPS) 
WILL BE INSERTED THROUGH TONIGHT...WITH GENEROUS LOW CHANCE POPS 
BEING MAINTAINED BEGINNING SUNDAY. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
SEVERAL SHORT WAVE TROUGHS WILL DROP SOUTHEASTWARD OUT OF WESTERN 
CANADA AND HELP MAINTAIN A DEEP...COMPOSITE LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER 
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE UNITED STATES. BECAUSE OF THE DEEP LAYERED 
TROUGH REACHING INTO THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...A WEAK SURFACE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL LINGER ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...WHILE THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE LINGERS NEAR THE 
FLORIDA KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA. WITH NO DISTINCT LARGE SCALE 
SUBSIDENCE OR ASCENT...LIGHT WINDS AND AMPLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL 
PROVIDE ENOUGH FUEL FOR MESOSCALE INTERACTIONS. HENCE...20 TO 30

A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTER HAS EASED SE OFF THE NEW ENGLAND 
COAST...AND AN ASSOCIATED HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE HAS BUILT SW 
COMPLETELY DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. SURFACE WINDS OVER THE 
FLORIDA KEYS TURNED TO EAST BY EARLY TODAY IN RESPONSE TO THE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE...AND THEN LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING A WIND 
SPEED SURGE WORKED WEST OVER THE AREA. SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS THAT ACCOMPANIED THE LEADING EDGE OF THE SURGE OVER 
THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS...FADED AS THEY HEADED WEST OVER THE 
LOWER KEYS AND ITS WATERS. AT THIS TIME...THE SURGE IS BETWEEN THE 
MARQUESAS KEYS AND DRY TORTUGAS. MOST SHOWERS HAVE DISSIPATED OVER 
THE KEYS AREA AS OF THIS TIME. SATELLITE WATER VAPOR AND GOES 
SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOW SOME HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE STILL PULLING 
NORTHWEST OVER THE LOWER KEYS IN RESPONSE TO THE CIRCULATION AROUND 
THE EAST SIDE OF A 200-300 MB LOW CENTER WHICH IS MOVING NW OVER THE

POSITIONED OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...AND IT
CONTINUES TO SLIDE EASTWARD. THE FLORIDA KEYS ARE NOW BENEATH A VERY 
DRY UPPER ATMOSPHERE...ON THE SOUTHEAST PERIPHERY OF THE GULF HIGH 
PRESSURE SYSTEM.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...AS OF 200 PM...1023 
MB HIGH REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE VIRGINIA PIEDMONT. WELL TO THE 
SOUTH OF THAT...A DECAYING FRONTAL SYSTEM IS ANALYZED FROM THE 
NORTHERN BAHAMAS TO OVER THE TIP OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND INTO THE 
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THUS...THE FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN IN A FAIRLY 
MOIST LIGHT AND VARIABLE WIND FLOW WITHIN THE BOUNDARY LAYER JUST 
SOUTH OF THIS WEAKENING FRONT. THE KEY WEST INTEGRATED PRECIPITABLE 
WATER SENSORS ARE CURRENTLY REGISTERING PWAT AT ONLY ABOUT 1.50 
INCHES.

.CURRENTLY...TEMPERATURES HAVE CLIMBED TO 90 DEGREES AT KEY 
WEST...AND 91 DEGREES AT MARATHON...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. 
KEY WEST RADAR IS DETECTING ONLY A FEW TINY SHOWERS ON THE SOUTHERN 
TIP OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA ATTM. SKIES ARE MOSTLY SUNNY OVER THE 
ISLANDS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. C-MAN STATIONS ARE REGISTERING LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE 10 METER WINDS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND SOUTHERN 
FLORIDA BAY.

.IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500 MB TO 200 MB)...THE DEEP ANTICYCLONE OVER 
THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL BUILD SLIGHTLY TO BETWEEN 592 TO 595 DM AT 
500 MB...AND BE CENTERED JUST NORTHEAST OF THE BAHAMAS THRU LATE IN 
THE WEEKEND. A SHORTWAVE NOW OVER THE WESTERN HIGH PLAINS WILL 
AMPLIFY INTO ANOTHER FULL LATITUDINAL TROUGH AS IT TRANSLATES 
EASTWARD BY THE WEEKEND. THE BASE OF THIS TROUGH WILL DROP DOWN INTO 
FLORIDA ON MONDAY...AND THEN FLATTEN OUT AGAIN BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT 
WEEK. AS A RESULT...A VERY DRY ATMOSPHERE IS EXPECTED ABOVE AT LEAST 
THE 700 MB LEVEL. 

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...TONIGHT...THE 
DECAYING SURFACE FRONT WILL COMPLETELY DISSIPATE. A WEAK 1016 MB 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS AND 
SOUTH FLORIDA. LIGHT AND VARIABLE SURFACE WINDS BETWEEN 5 AND 10 
MPH WILL GRADUALLY BECOME EASTERLY AND INCREASE TO NEAR 10 MPH AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. 

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL BUILD 
SLIGHTLY TO ABOUT 1018 TO 1020 MB NORTH OF THE KEYS. AS A 
RESULT...WILL SEE A RETURN TO GENTLE TO MODERATE TRADE BREEZES...AS 
THE KEYS WILL BE UNDER A STRONGER SUBSIDENT REGIME THAN WE HAVE SEEN 
FOR QUITE SOME TIME. THE 12Z FORECAST SOUNDINGS FOR THE KEYS ARE 
CONTINUING TO INDICATE A DECREASING TREND IN TOTAL PWAT(PRECIPITABLE 
WATER) THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH VALUES FALLING FROM BETWEEN 1.75 
AND 2.00 INCHES TO 1.5 INCHES BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. THE 12 HOUR 
RAIN CHANCES REMAIN WELL BELOW CLIMO FOR THIS PERIOD...WITH BOTH THE 
NAM AND GFS MOS POP #S BETWEEN 13 AND 27 PERCENT. SO WILL CONTINUE 
TO MAINTAIN ONLY ISOLATED COVERAGE FOR THIS PERIOD.

SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE MIGHT BEGIN TO 
WEAKEN SLIGHTLY...AND THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE REINTRODUCTION OF 
ADDITIONAL LOW AND MID LEVEL MOISTURE THROUGH A FAIRLY DEEP EASTERLY 
FLOW. THEREFORE THE MESOSCALE FORCING SHOULD STILL BE PRONOUNCED 
ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR NEAR CLIMO POPS. THUS...WILL HOLD WITH INHERITED 
POPS.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...A WEAKENED RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
REMAIN IN CLOSER PROXIMITY TO THE FLORIDA KEYS THROUGH THIS TIME. 
ANOTHER WEAK TROUGH IS PROGGED TO WASH OUT AGAIN OVER CENTRAL 
FLORIDA BY THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...AND THERE SHOULD BE NO 
FORESEEABLE AFFECTS ON THE KEYS. WILL STILL HAVE A MODERATELY MOIST 
LOWER ATMOSPHERE ATTM...WITH PWAT AROUND 1.50 INCHES AND AMPLE 
INSOLATION FOR THIS LATITUDE AT THIS TIME OF YEAR WILL STILL ALLOW 
FOR DAILY CUMULUS CLOUD LINES...AS WELL AS POSSIBLE CELL MOVEMENT 
FROM OFF THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA. CLIMO POPS ARE IN PLACE ATTM.

.MARINE...LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS THIS AFTERNOON...WILL BECOME 
NORTHEAST THIS EVENING...AND EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODERATE EAST 
SURFACE WINDS WILL PREVAIL ON ALL KEYS WATERS THIS WEEKEND. EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST SURFACE WINDS MAY DECREASE A BIT MONDAY AS AN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE NORTH OF THE KEYS RETREATS EASTWARD. THE

MAIN AXIS OF A SHARP FULL LATITUDINAL TROUGH EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL 
NEW ENGLAND SOUTH SOUTHWEST TO ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA. ON THE REGIONAL 
SCALE...THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN A COL REGION NEAR THE BASE OF 
THE TROUGH.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...AS OF 900 AM...A COOL 
1020 PLUS MB HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS CENTERED OVER WEST VIRGINIA 
THIS MORNING. SOUTH OF THAT...A STATIONARY FRONT IS POSITIONED OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA...AND IS GRADUALLY LOOSING IT FRONTAL CHARACTERISTICS. 
A NARROW BUT WEAK RIDGE IS JUST SOUTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS...OVER THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS...THUS THE FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN IN A FAIRLY MOIST 
LIGHT WEST FLOW WITHIN THE BOUNDARY LAYER.

.OBSERVATIONS...AS OF 900 AM...TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ISLANDS HAVE 
RISEN INTO THE MIDDLE 80S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MIDDLE 70S. SKIES 
ARE MOSTLY SUNNY. KBYX RADAR IS JUST DEPICTING JUST VERY ISOLATED 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE GULF AND ATLANTIC WATERS.  

&&

.FORECASTS...TODAY...(IN THE UPPER LEVELS)...THE BASE OF THE SHARP 
UPPER TROUGH WILL RAPIDLY LIFT OUT FROM SOUTH FLORIDA SOUTHEAST THIS 
MORNING...AS A NEAR 590 DM 500 MB ANTICYCLONE GRADUALLY BUILDS 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS...FLORIDA AND THE KEYS.

IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE LEVELS...TODAY AND TONIGHT...THE WEAK 
FRONTAL ZONE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA WILL GRADUALLY UNDERGO COMPLETE 
FRONTOLYSIS...AS A WEAK RIDGE SOUTH OF THE KEYS WILL BUILD ACROSS 
NORTH FLORIDA BY LATE IN THE DAY. LIGHT TO GENTLE NORTHWEST WINDS 
WILL GRADUALLY BECOME NORTHEAST BY LATE IN THE DAY...AND POSSIBLY 
EAST DURING THE LATE NIGHT HOURS. LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS IN THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER WILL GRADUALLY BECOME NORTHEAST BY SUNSET FROM THE 
SURFACE TO 10000 FEET. PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) VALUES WILL REMAIN 
AROUND 2.00 INCHES...BUT DO NOT EXPECT WINDS TO VEER TO NORTHEAST 
UNTIL VERY LATE IN THE DAY...SO THE MESOSCALE WILL BE QUITE LIMITED. 
THUS WILL MAINTAIN ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR TODAY.

&&

.MARINE...GENTLE NORTHWEST SURFACE WINDS ON ALL WATERS LATE THIS 
MORNING SHOULD SHIFT TO NORTHEAST BY LATER THIS AFTERNOON. WINDS 
WILL LIKELY BECOME EASTERLY BY SUNRISE FRIDAY MORNING. MODERATE EAST

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
300 PM EDT WED SEP 20 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500-200 MB)...AS OF 200 PM...THE 
MAIN AXIS OF A BROAD AND UNUSUALLY DEEP TROUGH IS POSITIONED FROM 
LAKE ONTARIO TO THE EAST CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. SOUTH OF THAT...A 
NARROW UPPER RIDGE AXIS EXTENDS FROM THE WESTERN TIP OF CUBA 
EASTWARD TO OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE JUST 
BENEATH THE SOUTHERN BASE OF THE LARGE SYNOPTIC SCALE TROUGH.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...AS OF 200 PM...A WEAK 
SURFACE COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM JUST OFF THE COAST OF EASTERN NEW 
ENGLAND SOUTHWEST TO ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA AND BISECTS THE NORTHERN 
AND SOUTHERN HALF OF THE GULF OF MEXICO. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...THE 
FLORIDA KEYS LIE IN A FAIRLY DRY LOWER ATMOSPHERE WITH LATEST 
INTEGRATED PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ACCORDING TO THE GPS MET SENSOR 
INDICATING THAT PRECIPITABLE WATER IS NOW AT ABOUT 1.5 INCHES.

.CURRENTLY...TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE LOWER 90S...WITH LOWER 
THAN AVERAGE DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 70S. KEY WEST RADAR 
DEPICTING ALMOST NO ECHOES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF ONE LONE SHOWER 
LEAKING INTO THE FAR NORTHWEST CORNER OF GMZ033. WINDS ACROSS THE 
ISLANDS ARE MAINLY WEST NEAR 10 MPH...AND NEAR 10 KNOTS ALONG THE 
FLORIDA REEF AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY...WITH SOME GUSTS TO BETWEEN 
13 AND 15 KNOTS.  


.IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500 MB TO 200 MB). A RATHER PROGRESSIVE PATTERN 
IS EXPECTED FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS OF SUMMER/FIRST FEW DAYS OF AUTUMN 
ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES...WITH MODELS INDICATING A 
FLATTENING OF THE EASTERN TROUGH BY THURSDAY. 588-590 DM 500MB 
RIDGING WILL BUILD IN ACROSS THE BAHAMAS AND FLORIDA FOR FRIDAY 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BY NEXT WEEK...(MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY) 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH DIVING SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE PLAINS WILL 
AMPLIFY INTO ANOTHER EARLY SEASON FULL LATITUDINAL TROUGH...WITH THE 
MAIN AXIS OF THE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD...INCLUDING FLORIDA.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...TONIGHT...THE 
12Z NAM AND GFS RUNS...AS WELL AS MOST CURRENT SURFACE OBSERVATIONS 
AND ANALYSIS...CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE TROUGH NOW 
APPROACHING SOUTH FLORIDA WILL GLIDE DOWN THE PENINSULA 
OVERNIGHT...THEN COME TO A HALT OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS. SHOWER 
AND THUNDERSTORMS ACTIVITY AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE ARE GRADUALLY 
DIMINISHING IN COVERAGE AND INTENSITY...AND DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES 
TODAY IN THE KEYS ONLY IN THE LOWER 70S. INTERESTINGLY...DEWPOINT 
TEMPERATURES IN NORTH FLORIDA HAVE ACTUALLY REMAINED IN THE 50S AND 
LOWER 60S THROUGHOUT THE DAY. 

ON THURSDAY...THE FRONT...OR WHATS LEFT OF IT...COULD KEEP A CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND...HOWEVER THE LATEST 12 HOUR 
POP #S HAVE COME DOWN INTO THE LOW/SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY THROUGH 
00Z. IF THE FRONT STALLS A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH THAN NEAR THE 
KEYS...THEN ISOLATED SHOWERS MIGHT BE ALL WE GET OUT OF IT...DUE TO 
A SLIGHTLY MORE STABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH LITTLE OR NO LIFT IN PLACE. 
THE GFS IS STILL INDICATING THAT WINDS COULD BE LIGHT AND NORTHERLY 
OVER THE KEYS BEHIND THE TROUGH...WHILE THE NAM IS INDICATING 
VARIBLE WINDS AS THE WEAK TROUGH COULD BE RIGHT OVER US. 

THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL SEE A 
RETURN TO A MORE LATE SEPTEMBER LIKE TRADE REGIME AS A WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL REBUILD OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. 12 
HOUR POP #S HAVE DECREASED TO AROUND 20 PERCENT THROUGH THIS 
PERIOD...WITH GREATER THAN 70% MOISTURE WILL GENERALLY REMAIN 
CONFINED TO BELOW THE 850 MB LAYER. EXPECT GENTLE TO MODERATE 
EASTERLY FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO BETWEEN 10 TO 15 KFT. WILL MAKE NO 
CHANGES TO THE ONGOING FORECAST.

EXTENDED...SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN STATIONARY. ANOTHER TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS 
WILL SLIDE INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. IN 
ADDITION...SHOULD SEE A RETURN TO GREATER MOISTURE DEPTH...AS THE 
EASTERIES INCREASES AGAIN FROM THE SURFACE TO 20 KFT THROUGH THE 
PERIOD. 12 HOUR POPS THROUGH THE PERIOD ARE NEAR 30 PERCENT...AND 
THIS IS RIGHT AT CLIMO AND ALSO WHAT WE HAVE GOING FOR THE 
EXTENDED.    

&&

.MARINE...MAINLY WEST WINDS ARE ALREADY INCREASING AHEAD OF THE 
APPROACHING TROUGH THIS EVENING. SHOULD SEE WINDS SHIFT TO NORTHWEST 
AND THEN NORTH BY TOMORROW. THREAT EXISTS FOR WIND GUSTS TO 30 KNOTS 
WITHIN JUST ISOLATED COVERAGE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WINDS COULD 
BECOME NORTHERLY FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME TOMORROW. WINDS SHOULD 
BECOME EASTERLY BY FRIDAY. MODERATE EAST SURFACE WINDS WILL PREVAIL 
ON ALL KEYS WATERS FOR THIS WEEKEND. LATEST AVAILABLE WAVEWATCH 
INDICATES ANY RESIDUAL SWELL FROM HURRICANE HELENE (EXPECTED BY NHC 
TO PASS EAST OF 60 WEST) IS NOT EXPECTED TO FILTER INTO KEYS WATERS. 
NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TODAY THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. 
 
&&

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE AND AT THE KMTH AND KEYW ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD APPROACH THE FLIGHT ROUTE 
FROM THE NORTH LATER THIS EVENING...AND MAY PRODUCE BRIEF MVFR OR 
IFR CIGS OR VSBYS. EXPECTED SURFACE WINDS FROM 310 DEGREES BETWEEN 5 
AND 10 KNOTS OVERNIGHT AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AN EARLY SEASON WEATHER FRONT USHERING A BIT COOLER AND MUCH DRIER 
AIR INTO THE SOUTHERN STATES EXTENDED THROUGH CENTRAL GEORGIA TO THE 
WESTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE AS OF 8 PM EDT. A WIDE BAND OF WESTERLY 
WINDS 15 KT AND GUSTY COVERED MUCH OF FLORIDA AND THE EASTERN GULF 
OF MEXICO SOUTH OF THE FRONT. NUMEROUS SHOWERS WITH SCATTERED 
EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WERE WITHIN THE WESTERLY FLOW FROM TAMPA TO 
FT. MYERS AND OFFSHORE...WHILE WIDELY SCATTERED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION CONTINUED TO DEVELOP OVER GULF WATERS SOUTH OF THERE TO 
THE KEYS. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE PRODUCED WIND GUSTS OF 30 TO 34 KT AT 
SOME C-MAN SITES THIS EVENING INCLUDING VENICE AND LONG KEY...WHILE 
A SHIP IN THE STRAITS JUST NORTHWEST OF BIMINI REPORTED 34 KT 
CONVECTIVE-RELATED WINDS. MEANWHILE...AWAY FROM CONVECTION...KEYS 
WIND GAUGES ARE SHOWING WEST WINDS CLOSE TO 10 KT. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
NO UPDATE IS NEEDED TO PUBLIC ZONES AT THIS TIME. WHILE CONVECTION 
OVER THE KEYS HAS WANED A BIT AT THIS MOMENT...I SEE NO REASON WHY 
ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD NOT FORM OVER GULF, BAY, 
AND STRAITS WATERS OVERNIGHT...AND MOVE EAST ONTO KEYS ISLANDS. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEST...OR AT TIMES WEST-SOUTHWEST...WIND FLOW NEAR 10 KT MAY PICK 
UP INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE TOWARD MORNING. MOST IMPORTANTLY...WIND 
GUSTS OF 30 KT OR SO ARE POSSIBLE NEAR THUNDERSTORMS THAT FORM AND 
MOVE INTO THE AREA OVERNIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
AND AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. CURRENTLY...WIDELY 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE PRODUCING MVFR/IFR 
CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE...WITH A LARGE AREA OF CLOUDS AND RAIN 
MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AHEAD OF A TROUGH 
OF LOW PRESSURE. AT THIS TIME IT REMAINS UNCLEAR TO WHAT EXTENT THIS 
CONVECTION WILL PENETRATE OUR AREA...THUS HAVE MAINTAINED WIDELY 
SCATTERED/ISOLATED COVERAGE OVERNIGHT IN THE TWEB PRODUCT. 
HOWEVER...IF THE TROUGH MAKES SUFFICIENT HEADWAY THAT THE ACTIVITY 
CURRENTLY AFFECTING SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA BLEEDS DOWN INTO THE TWEB 
ROUTE...COVERAGE WILL NEED TO BE INCREASED IN THE SUBSEQUENT 
FORECAST. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE MAINLY WEST AT 8 KT OR LESS 
OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS.

TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE MIDDLE 80S THIS MORNING WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
THE MIDDLE 70S. WINDS WERE LIGHT SOUTHERLY TENDING SOUTHWEST. RADAR 
SHOWED ISOLATED SHOWERS OUT IN THE GULF MOSTLY.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
IT IS MUCH QUIETER TODAY SINCE THE MID-LEVEL FLOW HAS VEERED INTO 
THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST WHICH HAS ABATED MOST OF THE LIFT. THE TREND 
WILL BE FOR CELLS WHICH FORM IN THE GULF TO MOVE EAST TOWARD OUR SEA 
ZONES AND THE LOWER KEYS. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
WITH THIS IN MIND AND CONSIDERING THAT WE DO HAVE ECHOES ON RADAR IN 
THE GULF...WE PLAN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO TEXTS AND GRIDS THIS 
MORNING.
&&

.MARINE...
THE SEA ZONES FROM KEY WEST TO DRY TORTUGAS TO CHOKOLOSKEE WILL BE 
MOST VULNERABLE TO SHOWERS TODAY. KEY LARGO WATERS BOTH OCEAN SIDE 
AND BAY SIDE WILL PROBABLY REMAIN RAIN-FREE.

.AVIATION...
SHOWER COVERAGE WILL INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON ON THE MAINLAND PORTION 
OF THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY WEST. CELL MOVEMENT APPROX 28010KT WILL

.OBSERVATIONS...
TEMPERATURES CLIMBED TO AROUND 90 TODAY IN THE ISLANDS. WE HAD 
NEARLY FULL SUNSHINE WITH JUST A FEW ECHOES ON RADAR -- LOTS OF 
CHAFF TODAY. WINDS WERE LIGHT SOUTHERLY TENDING SOUTHWEST.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
IT WAS MUCH QUIETER TODAY SINCE THE MID-LEVEL FLOW HAS VEERED INTO 
THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST WHICH HAS ABATED MOST OF THE LIFT. A FRONT OR 
WIND SHIFT BOUNDARY IS WORKING INTO NORTHERN FLORIDA...BUT RIDGING 
AND WARM AIR ADVECTION AHEAD OF IT HAS GIVEN US THE SUNSHINE 
TODAY.
&&

.FORECASTS...
WE HAVE ADOPTED THE TIMING OF THE GFS IN OUR TEXT AND GRIDS. IT HAS 
BEEN A LONG TIME SINCE WE HAD ANY REAL WIND DOWN HERE...AND GUIDANCE 
KEEPS IT THAT WAY WITH NOTHING GREATER THAN 15 KNOTS WHICH SEEMS 
RIGHT. NORTHERLIES BRIDGING THE FRONT WILL LIMIT CONVERGENCE SO WE 
ARE NOT EXPECTING A BIG RAIN EVENT...JUST A WIND SHIFT INTO THE 
NORTH AND SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES. THE FRONT IS LIKELY TO 
STALL IN THE STRAITS WHICH SUGGESTS A HIGHER CLOUD FRACTION THAN 
NORMAL. BY THE COMING WEEKEND WINDS COME BACK INTO THE EAST AND 
INCREASE SOMEWHAT -- A TRADE-LIKE REGIME WHICH WILL FEEL NICE. 
&&

.MARINE...
OUR GULF SEA ZONES FROM KEY WEST TO DRY TORTUGAS TO CHOKOLOSKEE WILL 
EXHIBIT THE GREATEST RESPONSE TO THE UPCOMING WEST AND NORTHWEST 
WINDS. ONCE WE GO INTO THE NORTH...THE ATLANTIC SIDE WILL BE 
PROTECTED. IF YOU ARE PLANNING A PASSAGE YOU WILL WANT TO CHECK FOR 
UPDATES DAILY.
&&

.AVIATION...
WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE SHORT 
DURATION MVFR VSBYS AND CIGS...AND EVEN BRIEFER IFR CONDITIONS OVER 
THE LAND PORTION OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THIS EVENING. 
OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE REMAINDER OF THE 
KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS

.CURRENTLY... 
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE MOSTLY CLEAR. WINDS OVER LAND ARE 
SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH AT 5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE 
SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 
80S. ONLY ABOUT FOUR DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO 
GENTLE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES 
IN THE UPPER 80S.  

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE FLORIDA STRAITS WILL 
RETREAT EASTWARD TODAY. A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS 
CENTRAL FLORIDA TONIGHT. DESPITE LACK OF OBVIOUS LARGE SCALE LIFT...
THERE IS ENOUGH MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IN PLACE TO WARRANT MIDDLE 
OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE AFOREMENTIONED 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA WEDNESDAY. THERE 
MAY BE SOME MID TO UPPER LEVEL ASCENT AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE WEDNESDAY. THEREFORE...POPS WILL BE INCREASED BY 10 PERCENT 
FOR WEDNESDAY. THE LATEST GFS NUMERICAL MODEL SOLUTION DEPICTS A 
VERY DRY AIR MASS WORKING ITS WAY OVER THE KEYS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL INDICATES PWAT VALUES GRADUALLY 
FALLING FROM NEAR TWO INCHES WEDNESDAY EVENING TO JUST ABOVE ONE 
INCH BY SUNSET THURSDAY. TYPICALLY...THIS TYPE OF AIR MASS DOES NOT 
MAKE IT TO THE KEYS UNTIL OCTOBER AT THE EARLIEST. AS A RESULT...I 
AM HESITANT TO DROP POPS ANY LOWER THAN 20 PERCENT FOR THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE NEAR THE EAST COAST OF THE UNITED STATES FRIDAY SHOULD 
MOVE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC FRIDAY NIGHT. PWAT VALUES SHOULD 
SLOWLY BEGIN TO INCREASE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY...BEFORE RETREATING EASTWARD MONDAY. THE SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE 
BASED ON CLIMATOLOGY.  

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE SOUTH SURFACE WINDS THIS MORNING SHOULD GRADUALLY SHIFT TO 
WEST BY TONIGHT. WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS SHOULD INCREASE A BIT 
WEDNESDAY AS A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE MOVES OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. 
WINDS MAY BECOME NORTHERLY FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF TIME THURSDAY...
DEPENDING UPON HOW FAR SOUTH THE AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE MAKES IT. WINDS SHOULD BECOME EASTERLY BY THIS UPCOMING 
WEEKEND. 

&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH 24Z...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. ONLY ISOLATED

WEAKLY DIVERGENT FLOW ALOFT WAS AIDING THE FORMATION OF SHOWERS OFF

THE REAL GENERATIVE MECHANISM EARLIER TODAY...BUT THIS HAS BEEN 
DISRUPTED BY THE CONVECTION AND SNUFFED BY STABLE OUTFLOWS AND

LOW-LEVEL WAVE-LIKE DISTURBANCE HAS BEEN TRAVERSING THE STRAITS 
TODAY. COMBINED WITH A LAND-BREEZE BOUNDARY IT HAS BEEN GENERATING 
THE SHOWERS AT THE TORTUGAS...ALSO AIDED BY THE WEAKLY DIVERGENT

LATER TONIGHT IF THINGS STAY QUIET. 

FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD WE HAVE FOLLOWED THE 
AVAILABLE GUIDANCE WHICH CALLS FOR A FRONTAL PASSAGE AROUND THURSDAY 
FOLLOWED BY NORTHERLY WINDS. THICKNESS ADVECTION SUPPORTS THE IDEA 
OF A LITTLE COOLING AND DRYING...YET IT STILL SEEMS EARLY IN THE

GONE NO FARTHER. WE HAVE CONTINUED CLIMATOLOGICALLY AVERAGE OR

.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE MOSTLY CLEAR OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN THIS MORNING. WINDS 
WERE LIGHT EASTERLY IN THE UPPER KEYS AND LIGHT SOUTHWEST AT KEY 
WEST AND TORTUGAS. RADAR WAS FREE OF ECHOES WITHIN OUR SERVICE 
AREA...AND WAS JUST PICKING UP SOME SHOWERS OUT BY CAY SAL BANK AND 
ANDROS ISLAND. OUR MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS 
THROUGH GREAT DEPTH AND RETAINED SOME INHIBITION FROM 925 TO 850 MB 
EVEN AFTER MODIFYING FOR HEATING. TOTAL MOISTURE HAD DECREASED TO 
AROUND 1.9 INCHES.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE CLOUDS AND SHOWERS IN THE BAHAMAS LIE ALONG THE AXIS OF THE 
UPPER TROF THAT WAS IN OUR VICINITY YESTERDAY...SHOWING THAT THIS 
FEATURE HAD MOSTLY MOVED THROUGH OUR AREA AND THAT WE ARE NOW ON THE 
BACK SIDE. NORTHWEST WINDS ABOVE ABOUT 250 MB ON OUR SOUNDING 
SUPPORTED THIS. THOUGH IT COULD NOT BE DISCERNED IN THE 
OBSERVATIONAL DATA...THE REMAINS OF YESTERDAYS SURFACE BOUNDARY AND 
850 TROF MUST ALSO BE LOCATED WELL TO OUR SOUTHEAST AND ARE ALL 
WORKING TOGETHER TO PRODUCE THE SHOWERS THERE.

THE EASTERLIES IN THE UPPER KEYS ALSO EXIST ALONG THE FLORIDA EAST 
COAST. WE ANALYZE THE AXIS OF A SURFACE RIDGE JUST OFF SHORE WHICH 
IS THE SOURCE REGION FOR THE EASTERLIES. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS 
DISTINCT DRYING HERE WHICH GOES ALONG WITH THE IDEA THAT THIS AREA 
IS ON THE BACK SIDE OF UPPER SYSTEM. 

THE SOUTHERLIES AND SOUTHWESTERLIES IN THE WESTERN STRAITS AND IN 
THE GULF SUGGEST A WAVE OF SOME SORT IN THIS LOCATION...MOVING WEST. 
A QUICKSCAT PASS WOULD BE REALLY NICE BUT UNFORTUNATELY IS NOT 
AVAILABLE. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
PUTTING IT TOGETHER WE ARE IN TRANSITION TODAY. THE TREND WILL BE 
FOR DRYING ON THE MAINLAND WHICH WILL REDUCE COVERAGE THERE...AND 
HENCE REDUCE THE RAIN CHANCES IN THE UPPER KEYS WHICH WAS SO 
EXTENSIVE YESTERDAY. THE EASTERLIES OUGHT TO EXTEND THEMSELVES DOWN 
THE LINE OVER TIME...AS THE TRANSIENT WAVE-LIKE DISTURBANCE MOVES 
AWAY. MEANWHILE WE WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR HEATING TO SEE IF THE 
INHIBITION CAN BE OVERCOME AND A CLOUD LINE DEVELOP IN THE LOWER 
KEYS. 

SO FOR THE BALANCE OF THE DAY THE BEST CHANCES ARE PROBABLY GOING TO 
BE ON KEY LARGO AS A STRAY SHOWER MOVES IN FROM THE BAHAMAS ON THE 
EASTERLIES. LATE IN THE DAY THE LOWER KEYS MAY BE VULNERABLE...BUT 
THE GREATER LIKELIHOOD MIGHT BE FOR A VICINITY-SITUATION WITH THE 
SHOWERS JUST OFF SHORE. 

AS A RESULT...IF WE ARE STILL QUIET...SOMETIME BEFORE NOON WE INTEND

DROP TO ISOLATED COVERAGE IN OUR UPCOMING ROUTINE ISSUANCE OF THE

SOUTH FLORIDA YESTERDAY IS NO LONGER IDENTIFIABLE IN THE REGION. A 
WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE HAS STARTED TO BUILD FROM THE 
CAROLINAS AND GEORGIA SOUTHWARD ALONG THE FLORIDA ATLANTIC COAST. 
THIS HAS RESULTED IN A TURN OF KEYS AREA WINDS TO A GENERAL EASTERLY 
DIRECTION OVERNIGHT AS EXPECTED. HOWEVER...LARGE CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT HAVE REPEATEDLY FORMED OVER ATLANTIC WATERS 
OFF THE KEYS AND SE FLORIDA PENINSULA HAVE PRODUCED NUMEROUS 
LONG-LIVED OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WHICH ARE OBSCURING THE SYNOPTIC WIND

WINDS WITH GUSTS OF 20 KT OR SO. AT 500 MB...THE SOUTHERN END OF A

.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE PARTLY CLOUDY THIS MORNING OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 80S AND DEW POINTS IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 
70S. WINDS WERE LIGHT NORTHEAST...AROUND 5 MPH...NOT MUCH HELP. 
RADAR SHOWED ISOLATED SHOWERS WITH DIAMETERS 5NM MOSTLY OVER OUR 
ATLANTIC WATERS. SHOWERS WERE A LITTLE MORE ROBUST IN THE EASTERN 
PORTIONS OF THE SERVICE AREA. THE MORNING SOUNDING WAS MOIST WITH PW 
>2.0 INCHES AND UNSTABLE WITH K34 AND LI-9...WITH VERY LITTLE WIND 
THROUGH THE COLUMN.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
OUR MORNING MESO PLOT SHOWS A CONVERGENT SURFACE BOUNDARY IN OUR 
VICINITY...JUST OUTSIDE THE REEF. RIDGING TO OUR NORTH WAS PROVIDING 
THE LIGHT NORTHEASTERLIES ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THIS FEATURE...WHILE 
LIGHT SOUTHWESTERLIES PREVAILED OUT IN THE STRAITS. A 30-50KT 
WESTERLY JET STREAK AT 30KPA CURVES CYCLONICALLY ACROSS THE 
PENINSULA FROM PINE ISLAND TO JUPITER INLET AND DEFINES THE BASE OF 
A TROF ALOFT BUILDING INTO THE REGION. THE RR ENTRANCE REGION IS 
LOCATED NEAR GRAND BAHAMA AND WALKERS CAY...ENHANCING LIFT. 
NORTHERLY WINDS AT THIS LEVEL ARE PRESENT NEAR WAYCROSS AND 
TALLAHASSEE. THIS HINT OF A COUPLED JET STRUCTURE SUGGESTS THE TROF 
IS DEEPENING.
&&

.FORECASTS...
ALL THE SIGNS POINT TO AN ACTIVE DAY. LIGHT NORTHEAST FLOW SUGGESTS 
A CLOUD LINE FAVORING THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE ISLANDS. THE TROFFING 
ALOFT WILL ADD TO INSTABILITY AND HELP VENTILATE THE TOWERS 
PROLONGING CELL LIFETIMES. THE WBZ OUGHT TO FALL AS WELL...WHICH 
WILL PROMOTE DOWNDRAFTS AND GUSTY SURFACE WINDS. VERY SLOW CELL 
MOVEMENT MEANS LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. THE EASTERN HALF OF OUR SERVICE 
AREA WILL BE FAVORED FOR THE STRONGER CELLS...SAY FROM LONG KEY TO

FROM DIRECT THERMAL ACTION. 

WE ARE CARRYING 50 PERCENT CHANCES TODAY WHICH SEEMS ABOUT RIGHT AND

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY... 
ISLAND AND MARINE-SITE WIND GAUGES AROUND THE KEYS CURRENTLY REPORT 
WIND SPEEDS RANGING FROM ZERO TO 3 KT...FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. THIS 
SUPPORTS THE EXPECTED WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT THAT WAS EXPECTED. A 
SLENDER SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE LIES APPROXIMATELY EAST-WEST 
OVER THE KEYS...POSSIBLY WITH A COL REGION IN THE MIDST OF THE AREA 
AS WELL. A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH IS SEEN SAGGING SOUTH OVER THE 
ATLANTIC...TO THE SE FLORIDA COAST. WATER VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER 
IMAGERY SHOWS DRY AIR ALOFT HAVING MOVED INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA...BUT 
SOUTH FLORIDA, THE KEYS, AND BAHAMAS REMAIN WITHIN A TYPICALLY MOIST 
ATMOSPHERE WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 2 INCHES OR MORE. DESPITE 
THE LIGHT WIND FLOW AROUND THE KEYS...WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE CONTINUED TO FORM AND LINGER THROUGH THE 
NIGHT...MAINLY OVER STRAITS WATERS. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY...THE LIGHT AND VARIABLE WIND PATTERN...AND AMPLE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE...SHOULD AID SHOWER & THUNDERSTORM BUILD-UPS OVER OR NEAR 
KEYS ISLANDS IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY. HOWEVER...THERE IS INDICATION 
IN THE GFS MODEL OF AN ONSET OF NNE WINDS SURFACE TO ABOVE 5000 FT 
AGL (STILL QUITE LIGHT) DURING MID TO LATE AFTERNOON THAT COULD 
NUDGE BUILD-UPS SOUTH AND OFF ISLANDS. THE NAM MODEL SHOWS LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE WINDS AT LOW LEVELS THROUGH THE DAY. SINCE GFS MOS HAS 50 
PCT POPS TODAY (AND NAM 60 PCT)...I WILL OPT TO STICK WITH GFS 
GUIDANCE AND INDICATE 50 PCT AS WELL. THERE IS NO CLEAR-CUT STEERING 
FLOW THIS AFTERNOON THAT MIGHT DRIVE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND 
CONVECTION TOWARD THE KEYS...HOWEVER THERE IS A 500 MB TROUGH THAT 
WILL SWING SE OVER FLORIDA AND APPROACH SOUTH FLORIDA LATE TODAY...
POSSIBLY AIDING AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. 

TONIGHT...MODELS SUGGEST THAT SOME FAINT REMNANT OF A SURFACE TROUGH 
MAY SLIP SOUTH ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST TO EXTREME SOUTHERN 
PENINSULA AREAS. THIS MIGHT FOCUS A LITTLE SURFACE CONVERGENCE SOUTH 
OF THE TROUGH TO NEAR THE UPPER KEYS...WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 
THE SOUTHERN END OF A MID LEVEL TROUGH IS SHOWN TO DRAG SOUTH OVER 
THE KEYS. A WEAK NE TO E SURFACE WIND MAY SET IN DURING THE NIGHT
AS SOME HIGH PRESSURE FORMS INTO NORTH FLORIDA. THESE FACTORS POINT 
TO KEEPING POPS A LITTLE HIGHER TONIGHT (40 PCT) THAN CURRENT 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS SHOW (30 PCT). 

SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...A LIGHT EAST FLOW WILL TURN SOUTHEAST
AS WEAK HIGH PRESSURE INITIALLY OVER NORTH FLORIDA SINKS SOUTH 
TOWARD THE BAHAMAS. NO MUCH IN THE WAY OF SYNOPTIC LIFT IS SEEN...
BUT ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE CONTENT SHOULD REMAIN HIGH OVER THE KEYS...
SO CLIMO POPS OF 30 PCT ARE REASONABLE. 

TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THE SURFACE RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO ALIGN
MORE EAST-WEST AND SHIFT OVER THE KEYS TUESDAY BRINGING LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE WINDS TO THE AREA AGAIN. OVER-ISLAND SHOWER FORMATION IN 
THE AFTERNOON WOULD ACCOMPANY THIS PATTERN TUESDAY. GFS MODEL SHOWS 
THE RIDGE SHIFTING SOUTH TO CUBA WEDNESDAY...WITH SW WINDS SETTING 
IN OVER THE KEYS...WHICH MAY AGAIN AID TCU LINES TO FORM OVER THE 
ISLANDS. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW A BAND OF 
DEEP MOISTURE AND MID LEVEL SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT SAGGING SOUTH OVER 
THE KEYS IN ADVANCE OF AN EARLY SEASON FRONTAL BOUNDARY. IF THIS 
PATTERN PERSISTS IN SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS...THEN A PERIOD OF MORE 
CLOUDINESS AND HIGHER CHANCE OF RAIN MAY BE NEEDED IN SUBSEQUENT 
FORECASTS. THERE HAS BEEN SOME RUN-TO-RUN TIMING AND POSITIONING
INCONSISTENCIES...SO I WILL NOT CULL OUT THIS TIME FRAME JUST YET. 

THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS AND THE LATEST EUROPEAN 
MODEL RUN JUST IN BOTH INDICATE THAT ANY BAROCLINIC ZONE THAT COMES 
DOWN INTO FLORIDA WILL NOT REACH THE KEYS BUT STALL TO OUR NORTH. 
NONETHELESS...IF LARGE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE EASTERN STATES 
INTO FLORIDA...KEYS AREA WINDS MAY RESPOND BY TURNING TO NE AND 
INCREASING IN SPEED...WITH MAYBE SOME DRYING ALOFT...BUT ALAS NO 
SURFACE COOLING. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN WILL GIVE LIGHT WINDS AND MOSTLY SMOOTH 
WATERS TO THE KEYS TODAY. HOWEVER...WATCH FOR LIGHTNING AND EVEN 
POSSIBLY SOME WATERSPOUTS TODAY. 

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH WILL TURN KEYS WINDS TO NE-E TONIGHT 
THEN MAINLY EAST NEAR 10 KT SUNDAY...GOING SE MONDAY...THEN LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE AGAIN TUESDAY AS ANOTHER WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
SETTLES SOUTH OVER THE KEYS. A TROUGH MOVING INTO FLORIDA WEDNESDAY
WILL CAUSE KEYS AREA WINDS TO PICK UP TO 10 KT OR MAYBE A BIT MORE
FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
PRODUCE LOCAL MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE...ESPECIALLY ON 
THE MAINLAND AND IN CLOUD LINES AROUND THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. 
SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE NEARLY STATIONARY...SO MVFR/IFR

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
400 AM EDT SAT SEP 16 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY... 
ISLAND AND MARINE-SITE WIND GAUGES AROUND THE KEYS CURRENTLY REPORT 
WIND SPEEDS RANGING FROM ZERO TO 3 KT...FROM ALL DIRECTIONS. THIS 
SUPPORTS THE EXPECTED WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT THAT WAS EXPECTED. A 
SLENDER SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE LIES APPROXIMATELY EAST-WEST 
OVER THE KEYS...POSSIBLY WITH A COL REGION IN THE MIDST OF THE AREA 
AS WELL. A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH IS SEEN SAGGING SOUTH OVER THE 
ATLANTIC...TO THE SE FLORIDA COAST. WATER VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER 
IMAGERY SHOWS DRY AIR ALOFT HAVING MOVED INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA...BUT 
SOUTH FLORIDA, THE KEYS, AND BAHAMAS REMAIN WITHIN A TYPICALLY MOIST 
ATMOSPHERE WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 2 INCHES OR MORE. DESPITE 
THE LIGHT WIND FLOW AROUND THE KEYS...WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE CONTINUED TO FORM AND LINGER THROUGH THE 
NIGHT...MAINLY OVER STRAITS WATERS. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY...THE LIGHT AND VARIABLE WIND PATTERN...AND AMPLE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE...SHOULD AID SHOWER & THUNDERSTORM BUILD-UPS OVER OR NEAR 
KEYS ISLANDS IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY. HOWEVER...THERE IS INDICATION 
IN THE GFS MODEL OF AN ONSET OF NNE WINDS SURFACE TO ABOVE 5000 FT 
AGL (STILL QUITE LIGHT) DURING MID TO LATE AFTERNOON THAT COULD 
NUDGE BUILD-UPS SOUTH AND OFF ISLANDS. THE NAM MODEL SHOWS LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE WINDS AT LOW LEVELS THROUGH THE DAY. SINCE GFS MOS HAS 50 
PCT POPS TODAY (AND NAM 60 PCT)...I WILL OPT TO STICK WITH GFS 
GUIDANCE AND INDICATE 50 PCT AS WELL. THERE IS NO CLEAR-CUT STEERING 
FLOW THIS AFTERNOON THAT MIGHT DRIVE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND 
CONVECTION TOWARD THE KEYS...HOWEVER THERE IS A 500 MB TROUGH THAT 
WILL SWING SE OVER FLORIDA AND APPROACH SOUTH FLORIDA LATE TODAY...
POSSIBLY AIDING AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. 

TONIGHT...MODELS SUGGEST THAT SOME FAINT REMNANT OF A SURFACE TROUGH 
MAY SLIP SOUTH ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST TO EXTREME SOUTHERN 
PENINSULA AREAS. THIS MIGHT FOCUS A LITTLE SURFACE CONVERGENCE SOUTH 
OF THE TROUGH TO NEAR THE UPPER KEYS...WHILE AT THE SAME TIME 
THE SOUTHERN END OF A MID LEVEL TROUGH IS SHOWN TO DRAG SOUTH OVER 
THE KEYS. A WEAK NE TO E SURFACE WIND MAY SET IN DURING THE NIGHT
AS SOME HIGH PRESSURE FORMS INTO NORTH FLORIDA. THESE FACTORS POINT 
TO KEEPING POPS A LITTLE HIGHER TONIGHT (40 PCT) THAN CURRENT 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS SHOW (30 PCT). 

SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...A LIGHT EAST FLOW WILL TURN SOUTHEAST
AS WEAK HIGH PRESSURE INITIALLY OVER NORTH FLORIDA SINKS SOUTH 
TOWARD THE BAHAMAS. NO MUCH IN THE WAY OF SYNOPTIC LIFT IS SEEN...
BUT ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE CONTENT SHOULD REMAIN HIGH OVER THE KEYS...
SO CLIMO POPS OF 30 PCT ARE REASONABLE. 

TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THE SURFACE RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO ALIGN
MORE EAST-WEST AND SHIFT OVER THE KEYS TUESDAY BRINGING LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE WINDS TO THE AREA AGAIN. OVER-ISLAND SHOWER FORMATION IN 
THE AFTERNOON WOULD ACCOMPANY THIS PATTERN TUESDAY. GFS MODEL SHOWS 
THE RIDGE SHIFTING SOUTH TO CUBA WEDNESDAY...WITH SW WINDS SETTING 
IN OVER THE KEYS...WHICH MAY AGAIN AID TCU LINES TO FORM OVER THE 
ISLANDS. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW A BAND OF 
DEEP MOISTURE AND MID LEVEL SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT SAGGING SOUTH OVER 
THE KEYS IN ADVANCE OF AN EARLY SEASON FRONTAL BOUNDARY. IF THIS 
PATTERN PERSISTS IN SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS...THEN A PERIOD OF MORE 
CLOUDINESS AND HIGHER CHANCE OF RAIN MAY BE NEEDED IN SUBSEQUENT 
FORECASTS. THERE HAS BEEN SOME RUN-TO-RUN TIMING AND POSITIONING
INCONSISTENCIES...SO I WILL NOT CULL OUT THIS TIME FRAME JUST YET. 

THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS AND THE LATEST EUROPEAN 
MODEL RUN JUST IN BOTH INDICATE THAT ANY BAROCLINIC ZONE THAT COMES 
DOWN INTO FLORIDA WILL NOT REACH THE KEYS BUT STALL TO OUR NORTH. 
NONETHELESS...IF LARGE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE EASTERN STATES 
INTO FLORIDA...KEYS AREA WINDS MAY RESPOND BY TURNING TO NE AND 
INCREASING IN SPEED...WITH MAYBE SOME DRYING ALOFT...BUT ALAS NO 
SURFACE COOLING. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN WILL GIVE LIGHT WINDS AND MOSTLY SMOOTH 
WATERS TO THE KEYS TODAY. HOWEVER...WATCH FOR LIGHTNING AND EVEN 
POSSIBLY SOME WATERSPOUTS TODAY. 

WEAK HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH WILL TURN KEYS WINDS TO NE-E TONIGHT 
THEN MAINLY EAST NEAR 10 KT SUNDAY...GOING SE MONDAY...THEN LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE AGAIN TUESDAY AS ANOTHER WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
SETTLES SOUTH OVER THE KEYS. A TROUGH MOVING INTO FLORIDA WEDNESDAY
WILL CAUSE KEYS AREA WINDS TO PICK UP TO 10 KT OR MAYBE A BIT MORE
FROM THE SOUTHWEST. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
PRODUCE LOCAL MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE...ESPECIALLY ON 
THE MAINLAND AND IN CLOUD LINES AROUND THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. 
SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE NEARLY STATIONARY...SO MVFR/IFR 
CONDITIONS COULD LAST A WHILE AT ANY AFFECTED LOCATION. WINDS AT 
KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE VERY LIGHT TODAY...NEARLY CALM IN THE MORNING 
HOURS THEN VARIABLE AROUND 6 KT IN THE AFTERNOON.

920 PM EDT FRI SEP 15 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY... 
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT THE 
FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS 
OVER LAND ARE VARIABLE NEAR 5 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE 
VARIABLE NEAR 5 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE 
IN THE MID 80S. ONLY ABOUT TWO DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED 
OVERNIGHT DUE TO LIGHT AND VARIABLE SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (OVERNIGHT)...
IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE NEAR THE SOUTH CENTRAL PORTION OF THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA 
WILL PULL NORTHEASTWARD TONIGHT. MEANWHILE...IN THE LOW TO MID 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BEGIN TO BUILD ACROSS THE KEYS TONIGHT. IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF OF 
MEXICO WILL MOVE OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY 
WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE AND VERY MOIST...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER 
(PWAT) VALUE JUST ABOVE TWO INCHES. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD 
REMAIN CONSTANT TONIGHT. LOW-LEVEL OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES SHOULD PROVIDE 
A TRIGGERING MECHANISM FOR PRECIPITATION TONIGHT. THERE IS ENOUGH 
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IN PLACE TO WARRANT MIDDLE OF 
THE ROAD CHANCE POPS FOR TONIGHT. THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE 
FLORIDA KEYS HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...SO NO UPDATES ARE 
EXPECTED. 

&&

.MARINE...
VARIABLE SURFACE WINDS OF LESS THAN 10 KNOTS WILL PREVAIL ON ALL 
KEYS WATERS TONIGHT. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST WEDNESDAY.  

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE AND AT 
THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS TONIGHT. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE WILL BE 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. PERIODIC MVFR/IFR CIGS (LASTING LESS THAN 20 
MINUTES) AND VIS ARE POSSIBLE WITHIN THESE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND

320 PM EDT FRI SEP 15 2006

.DISCUSSION...
AN UPPER-AIR COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS AFTERNOON SHOWS A DEEP LAYER 
MEAN TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES...WITH AN AXIS EXTENDING 
DOWN TO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE. DEEP EASTERLIES PREVAIL OVER THE 
CARIBBEAN SEA...AND A WEAK RIDGE PERSISTS ACROSS THE SOUTH-CENTRAL 
GULF OF MEXICO AND FLORIDA KEYS. A VERY WEAK MSL PRESSURE PATTERN IS 
IN PLACE ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...RESULTING IN VERY LIGHT...OR 
OCCASIONALLY CALM...SURFACE BREEZES. LATEST WINDS FROM C-MAN 
PLATFORMS SHOW WIND SPEEDS LESS THAN 5KT FROM VARYING DIRECTIONS.

RECENT DATA FROM THE GOES-12 VISIBLE CHANNEL AND KEY WEST WSR-88D 
SHOW AN UPWARD TREND IN CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ALONG ISLAND AND 
OCEAN CUMULUS LINES ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA. CELLS ARE DRIFTING VERY 
SLOWLY TO THE SOUTH-SOUTHEAST. VISIBILITY IS IMPECCABLE RIGHT 
NOW...AND NUMEROUS TOWERING CUMULUS CONGESTUS AND CUMULONIMBUS 
CLOUDS ARE CURRENTLY VISIBLE IN ALL DIRECTIONS FROM THE WFO. RADAR 
DATA ALSO REVEAL A LARGE BIRD MIGRATION EPISODE ONGOING ALOFT WITH 
SOME ECHOES IN EXCESS OF 30DBZ...INDICATIVE OF A DENSE AERIAL 
TAPESTRY OF MIGRATING FOWL TOWARD LOWER LATITUDES.

FORECAST REASONING HAS CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS FEW CYCLES. 
DEEP BUT WEAK RIDGING IS LIKELY TO PERSIST FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS 
AS UPPER-AIR FLOW OVER THE NORTH AMERICAN MIDLATITUDES REMAINS 
PROGRESSIVE...KEEPING THE STRONGER WESTERLIES WELL NORTH OF THE 
KEYS. MEANWHILE...THE DEEP EASTERLY TRADES WILL STAY WELL SOUTH OR 
EAST OF THE KEYS. THE UPSHOT WILL BE NO TROPICAL SYSTEMS AND NO 
FRONTS. A VERY MOIST SUBCLOUD LAYER AND WEAK TO MODERATE VALUES OF 
CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY WILL PROVIDE SUFFICIENT ENERGY FOR 
SUBSYNOPTIC-SCALE FORCING MECHANISMS SUCH AS ISLAND/OCEAN/OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES TO INITIATE CONVECTIVE CELLS AT ALMOST ANY TIME OF THE 
DAY OR NIGHT. SCATTERED COVERAGE...OR 30-40 PERCENT 12-HOUR RAIN 
CHANCES ARE VERY REASONABLE FORECASTS AT THIS TIME. 
&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT AND VARIABLE BREEZES WILL PERSIST FOR ANOTHER DAY BEFORE 
TURNING NORTHEAST OR EAST SATURDAY NIGHT. THEREAFTER...A PERIOD OF 
LIGHT TO GENTLE MAINLY EAST BREEZES IS LIKELY FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY 
AS A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ORGANIZES NORTH OF THE KEYS. THEREAFTER...A 
TURN TO SOUTHEAST THEN SOUTH AND THEN PERHAPS WEST WILL OCCUR 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS A TROUGH MOVES BY TO OUR NORTH. BREEZES 
SHOULD REMAIN BELOW 15KT OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR 
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THE MAINLAND GRADUALLY 
WILL DECREASE IN COVERAGE AFTER ABOUT 00Z - 800 PM. CELL MOVEMENT 
WILL BE APPROX 29010KT WITH MOST TOPS AOB FL350 AND A FEW MAX TOPS 
TO FL500. HEAVY RAIN IN THE CORES WILL PRODUCE IFR/LIFR CIGS AND 
VSBYS AND SO THEY SHOULD BE AVOIDED. ISOLATED COVERAGE WILL BE

.CURRENTLY... 
AS OF 2 AM...THE SURFACE ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO SHOW A VERY WEAK 
PRESSURE PATTERN SURROUNDING THE KEYS...BUT AN OVERALL LIGHT WNW TO 
NW FLOW AT MARINE SITES SUGGESTS THAT A WEAK GULF OF MEXICO HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE MAY BE POKING SE OVER THE WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS
...WHILE ANY ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS IS RELEGATED TO MORE SOUTHERLY 
AREAS THAN NORMAL ACROSS THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. LOCAL WIND SPEEDS OVER 
WATER ARE RUNNING 2-5 KT...WHILE ISLAND SITES ARE MOSTLY CALM. 
WATER VAPOR AND GOES IMAGERY SHOWS CONTINUED HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT 
OVER THE KEYS. RADAR SHOWS WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS WITHOUT ANY 
DISCERNIBLE ORGANIZATION DOTTING THE KEYS AND BOTH GULF AND ATLANTIC 
SIDE WATERS. 

.FORECAST...
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS.


TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY...A LIGHT WIND FLOW MAY ALLOW FOR OVER-ISLAND

ADDITION...BECAUSE OF THE WIND FLOW PATTERN TODAY...AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA 
MAINLAND MAY DRIFT OR SEND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES TOWARD THE 
UPPER-MIDDLE KEYS. MODELS AGREE THAT A LIGHT NNW WIND FLOW SURFACE 
UP TO 500 MB WILL SET IN THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...WHICH COMBINED WITH AMPLE MOISTURE DEPTH AND SURFACE SEA 
BREEZE CONVERGENCE...SHOULD EITHER NUDGE THE MAINLAND CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT TOWARD THE SSE...OR AID IN SENDING SUBSEQUENT OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES TOWARD THE KEYS. THUS...ABOVE CLIMO 40 PCT POPS WILL
BE LEFT IN FORECASTS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH POSSIBILITY
THAT MID AND UPPER KEYS MAY SEE SOMEWHAT HIGHER CHANCES LATE TODAY 
AND THIS EVENING. ON SATURDAY...MODELS AGREE ON CONTINUED LIGHT WIND 
FLOW...BUT GFS AND UKMET BOTH SUGGEST THAT DURING THE AFTERNOON LOW 
LEVEL FLOW WILL TURN ENE OVER THE KEYS...THEREBY ENCOURAGING 
OVER-ISLAND SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM FORMATION. 40 PCT POPS WILL BE 
RETAINED IN THE FORECAST...BUT ALL MOS GUIDANCE INDICATES 50 PCT MAY 
BE BETTER. GFS MODEL SHOWS A MID TO HIGH LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHING 
THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA FROM THE NW SATURDAY AFTERNOON...BUT 
ALSO SHOWS MOST ASSOCIATED LIFT REMAIN NORTH OF THE KEYS. 

SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...LATEST GFS MODEL RUN NOW SHOWS A RETURN 
OF WEAK HIGH PRESSURE TO NORTH FLORIDA...SETTING IN SATURDAY NIGHT
BUT MORE SUBSTANTIALLY SUNDAY. A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH ON THE SOUTHERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA IS INDICATED TO STALL AND 
DISSIPATE OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA...WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDING SLIGHTLY SOUTH OVER THE KEYS...THEREBY TURNING KEYS WINDS 
TO EAST. THIS MAY SET IN SAT NIGHT...BUT MORE RELIABLY SO ON SUNDAY. 
30 PCT POPS MAY NEED UPPING TO 40 PCT PER MOS GUIDANCE...IN CASE
SOME SLIGHT CONVERGENCE REMAINS SOUTH OF THE DYING SURFACE TROUGH. 

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...A PERIOD OF MOIST LOW LEVEL 
EASTERLY FLOW IS INDICATED. A WEAK 500 MB TROUGH IS INDICATED TO 
STALL OVER THE REGION. 30 PCT POPS...OR CLIMO...WILL BE RETAINED IN 
THE FORECAST. 

TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...A WEAK UPPER RIDGE IS INDICATED TO POKE 
EAST OVER THE KEYS. AT THE SURFACE...THE LATEST GFS MODEL SHOWS A 
SURFACE RIDGE SLIDING SOUTH OVER THE KEYS DURING THIS TIME AS WELL...
WHICH IF THAT HOLDS UP IN SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS WILL INDICATE A
LIGHT WIND PATTERN RETURNING TO THE KEYS. 

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH IN THE MID 
AND HIGH LEVELS...WITH ASSOCIATED TROUGH AT THE SURFACE...IS SHOWN 
BY THE GFS TO MOVE SOUTH TO THE KEYS. WELL-DEFINED DEEP LAYER 
SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT...AND A BAND OF DEEPER MOISTURE...IS SHOWN 
TO SWEEP SE OVER THE KEYS. BEING IN THE LATER PERIODS...AND SOMEWHAT
OF AN ANOMALY FOR MID SEPTEMBER...I WILL HOLD OFF FOR NOW WITH 
INDICATIONS OF HIGHER THREAT OF RAIN UNTIL WE SEE SOME RUN-TO-RUN 
CONTINUITY. 

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...IF THAT SURFACE AND UPPER TROUGH DOES PASS

AGAIN...ITS TOO SOON TO GO WHOLE HOG WITH THIS.

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN SHOULD GIVE LIGHT WINDS AND GENERALLY SLIGHT

OUT OFF THE MIDDLE KEYS) TODAY. THESE SWELLS MAY BE NEAR 4 FT. 
OTHERWISE...BOATERS WATCH FOR AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS BUILDING NEAR 
THE KEYS...OR MOVING SSE OFF THE FLORIDA MAINLAND TODAY AND 
SATURDAY. SOME WATERSPOUT ACTION MAY BE SEEN SATURDAY AS WELL. 
A RETURN OF EAST WINDS IS EXPECTED SUNDAY DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE 
RETURNING TO NORTH FLORIDA AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC...MAYBE UP TO 10 KT 
IN THE STRAITS SUNDAY...FOLLOWED BY EAST WINDS 10 KT MOST KEYS

PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA IS INDICATED TO STALL AND 
DISSIPATE OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA...WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDING SLIGHTLY SOUTH OVER THE KEYS...THEREBY TURNING KEYS WINDS 
TO EAST. THIS MAY SET IN SAT NIGHT...BUT MORE RELIABLY SO ON SUNDAY. 
30 PCT POPS MAY NEED UPPING TO 40 PCT PER MOS GUIDANCE...IN CASE
SOME SLIGHT CONVERGENCE REMAINS SOUTH OF THE DYING SURFACE TROUGH. 

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...A PERIOD OF MOIST LOW LEVEL 
EASTERLY FLOW IS INDICATED. A WEAK 500 MB TROUGH IS INDICATED TO 
STALL OVER THE REGION. 30 PCT POPS...OR CLIMO...WILL BE RETAINED IN 
THE FORECAST. 

TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...A WEAK UPPER RIDGE IS INDICATED TO POKE 
EAST OVER THE KEYS. AT THE SURFACE...THE LATEST GFS MODEL SHOWS A 
SURFACE RIDGE SLIDING SOUTH OVER THE KEYS DURING THIS TIME AS WELL...
WHICH IF THAT HOLDS UP IN SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS WILL INDICATE A
LIGHT WIND PATTERN RETURNING TO THE KEYS. 

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH IN THE MID 
AND HIGH LEVELS...WITH ASSOCIATED TROUGH AT THE SURFACE...IS SHOWN 
BY THE GFS TO MOVE SOUTH TO THE KEYS. WELL-DEFINED DEEP LAYER 
SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT...AND A BAND OF DEEPER MOISTURE...IS SHOWN 
TO SWEEP SE OVER THE KEYS. BEING IN THE LATER PERIODS...AND SOMEWHAT
OF AN ANOMALY FOR MID SEPTEMBER...I WILL HOLD OFF FOR NOW WITH 
INDICATIONS OF HIGHER THREAT OF RAIN UNTIL WE SEE SOME RUN-TO-RUN 
CONTINUITY. 

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...IF THAT SURFACE AND UPPER TROUGH DOES PASS 
BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE GFS SHOWS...DRYING ALOFT MAY MOVE IN. 
AGAIN...ITS TOO SOON TO GO WHOLE HOG WITH THIS.

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN SHOULD GIVE LIGHT WINDS AND GENERALLY SLIGHT 
SEAS TO KEYS WATERS TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY. THE NOAA GLOBAL WAVE 
WAVE MODEL DOES SHOW SOME RESIDUAL LONG PERIOD (10-11 SECONDS) SWELL
MOVING SOUTH DOWN THE FLORIDA STRAITS OFF THE UPPER KEYS (AND FAR 
OUT OFF THE MIDDLE KEYS) TODAY. THESE SWELLS MAY BE NEAR 4 FT. 
OTHERWISE...BOATERS WATCH FOR AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS BUILDING NEAR 
THE KEYS...OR MOVING SSE OFF THE FLORIDA MAINLAND TODAY AND 
SATURDAY. SOME WATERSPOUT ACTION MAY BE SEEN SATURDAY AS WELL. 
A RETURN OF EAST WINDS IS EXPECTED SUNDAY DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE 
RETURNING TO NORTH FLORIDA AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC...MAYBE UP TO 10 KT 
IN THE STRAITS SUNDAY...FOLLOWED BY EAST WINDS 10 KT MOST KEYS 
WATERS ON THROUGH MONDAY. WE MIGHT SEE A SLACKENING OF WINDS AGAIN 
DURING TUESDAY WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE SETTING SOUTH OVER THE 
KEYS...BUT IM NO SURE ENOUGH TO ALTER ONGOING FORECASTS FOR TUE 
YET.

A WEATHER PATTERN FAIRLY TYPICAL OF MID SEPTEMBER IS EXPECTED FOR 
THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS. FIRST OFF...DEEP BUT WEAK RIDGING IS LIKELY TO 
PERSIST THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE MEAN 850-300MB LAYER WIND WILL 
PROBABLY NOT EXCEED 10KT FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT LENGTH OF TIME THROUGH 
NEXT THURSDAY. SECOND...VERY MOIST CONDITIONS IN THE SUBCLOUD LAYER 
ALONG WITH WEAK TO MODERATE CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY AND VERY WEAK 
CONVECTIVE INHIBITION WILL ENSURE A DAILY CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. NUANCES IN THE 1000-700MB LAYER FLOW ALONG WITH 
SUBTLE DIFFERENCES IN LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL SET THE STAGE 
DAILY FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT WITH SUBSYNOPTIC-SCALE BOUNDARY 
LAYER MECHANISMS SUCH AS ISLAND/OCEAN CLOUDLINES...SEA/LAND 
BREEZES...AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MODULATING CONVECTIVE INITIATION 
AND EVOLUTION AT THE SMALLEST SCALES.

THIS TYPE OF PATTERN IS A TYPICAL RAINY SEASON PATTERN AND DESERVING 
OF 30-40 PERCENT 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES...HIGHS NEAR 90...LOWS NEAR 
80...AND CHANGEABLE SKIES. 

FOR THIS WEEK...TROPICAL SYSTEMS WILL REMAIN WELL EAST...AND FRONTS

TODAY...AS A TROUGH BEGINS TO DEEPEN OVER THE EASTERN STATES. THE 
SURFACE REFLECTION SAGS ACROSS FLORIDA OVER THE NEXT 48 HOURS. A

THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING...BUT BEGIN TO VARY MORE TO THE WEST OR 
MAYBE EVEN NORTHWEST FOR A WHILE IN THE GULF WATERS. WITH SPEEDS 
BELOW 10 KNOTS AWAY FROM ANY CONVECTIVE CELLS...I WILL KEEP A 
VARIABLE WORDING IN FOR TODAY ALL THE WAY THROUGH SATURDAY. HIGH

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS AFTERNOON REVEALS DEEP 
BUT WEAK ANTICYCLONIC FLOW OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS. THE GOVERNING RIDGE WAS POSITIONED IN A SOUTHWEST-NORTHEAST 
ORIENTED FASHION ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...SOUTHERN 
FLORIDA PENINSULA...AND ADJACENT WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC...PLACING 
THE KEYS BENEATH THE RIDGE AT MOST LEVELS. A DRY AND STABLE AIR MASS 
OF CONTINENTAL ORIGIN WAS ADVECTED SOUTH OVER THE WATERS EAST OF THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA...ALONG THE WESTERNMOST OUTER CIRCULATION OF 
DEPARTING HURRICANE FLORENCE DURING THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. A 
SIGNIFICANT BUOYANCY GRADIENT HAS SET UP BETWEEN THIS AIR MASS AND 
THE MORE TROPICAL AIR MASS TO THE WEST AND SOUTH...AND A ZONE OF 
ENHANCED CONVECTIVE CLOUDINESS...SHOWERS...AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS 
DEVELOPED IN CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE BUOYANCY GRADIENT...FROM THE 
NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...SOUTH ACROSS THE WEST FLORIDA SHELF AND 
FLORIDA KEYS...TO THE SOUTHERN BAHAMAS. THE KEYS TODAY ARE WITHIN 
THIS AREA OF ENHANCED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY...ALTHOUGH FAIRLY WEAK 
LAPSE RATES AND WEAK TROPOSPHERIC WIND FLOW HAVE LIMITED UPDRAFT 
STRENGTH AND CONVECTIVE CELL LIFETIMES...WHILE ALLOWING A BUILDUP OF 
DECAYING CONVECTIVE CLOUD MATERIAL WITHIN MULTIPLE LAYERS ALOFT. THE 
SUPPLEMENTARY CLIMATOLOGICAL DATA...SCD...OBSERVATION FROM THE WFO 
AT 18Z INDICATED LIGHT RAIN WITH MULTIPLE LOW CLOUD TYPES... 
ALTOCUMULUS...ALTOSTRATUS...NIMBOSTRATUS...AND CIRRUS.

THE ENHANCED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD SLOWLY DIMINISH DURING THE 
NEXT 24 HOURS AS THE BUOYANCY GRADIENT WEAKENS DUE TO RAPID AIR MASS 
MODIFICATION OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC. WE WILL MAINTAIN A 40 
PERCENT CHANCE OF RAIN TONIGHT...WHICH IS ABOVE CLIMATOLOGY. DUE TO 
THE WEAK WIND FLOW...LOW-LEVEL BOUNDARIES WILL MODULATE MOST 
CONVECTIVE INITIATION AND EVOLUTION. CELL MOVEMENT WILL BE QUITE 
SLOW AND ERRATIC. 

FOR THURSDAY AND BEYOND...A REGIME OF DEEP BUT WEAK RIDGING IS 
LIKELY TO PERSIST OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS WITHIN AN ENVIRONMENT OF 
WEAK TO MODERATE CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY AND MOIST SUBCLOUD 
CONDITIONS WITH WEAK CONVECTIVE INHIBITION. MEANWHILE...A MORE 
PROGRESSIVE...AUTUMN-LIKE UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL EVOLVE OVER THE 
NORTH AMERICAN MIDLATITUDES...NORTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. WE WILL 
MAINTAIN A DAILY CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH HIGHS 
NEAR 90 AND LOWS NEAR 80.
&&

.MARINE...
A GENTLE SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH BREEZE LATE THIS AFTERNOON WILL LIKELY 
BECOME SOUTH...SOUTHWEST...OR VARIABLE OVERNIGHT WHILE DECREASING TO 
A LIGHT BREEZE. LIGHT AND VARIABLE BREEZES ARE THEN EXPECTED FROM 
THURSDAY THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY...WITH A RETURN TO MAINLY EAST 
BREEZES THEREAFTER. A NORTHEAST SWELL IN THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA OFF

SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS THIS MORNING HAVE BEEN 
CONCENTRATED IN THE FLORIDA BAY...CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 
KEYS...AND EXTENDING FURTHER INTO THE ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT TO 
THE ENTIRE STRETCH OF ISLANDS. IR SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE THAT 
SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY THOUGH FOR THE MAJORITY OF THE SERVICE AREA. 
ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE NORTHEAST WINDS ACROSS THE MARINE ZONES 
ARE VEERING SLIGHTLY...AND NOW AVERAGING JUST UNDER 10 KNOTS AT THE 
CMANS AND BELOW 10 MPH ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN. TEMPERATURES ARE IN 
THE LOWER 80S AT THIS HOUR.

.FORECAST...
A WEAK LOW LEVEL TROUGH IS IN THE VICINITY OF THE EASTERN 
BAHAMAS...WHILE THE LARGE HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE EAST COAST 
CONTINUES TO STRETCH SOUTH ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. THIS HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE FURTHER OFF INTO THE ATLANTIC WITH 
AN EXTENSION TO THE LOCAL AREA...WHILE THE TROUGH IN THE BAHAMAS 
LOSES DEFINITION. AS LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS IN THE DEEP SOUTH...A 
TRAILING TROUGH WILL SAG INTO FLORIDA BY THURSDAY AND INTO 
FRIDAY...AND THERE IS GOOD MODEL AGREEMENT THAT THE DRIER AIR 
CURRENTLY NORTH OF THE BAHAMIAN TROUGH WILL NOT PENETRATE FAR ENOUGH 
WEST TO INFLUENCE THE LOCAL WEATHER. IN FACT...GOOD MODEL AGREEMENT 
IN THE SHORT TERM THAT THE VEERING LOWER LEVEL WILL KEEP PWAT VALUES 
OVER 2 OVER THE AREA WITH A TONGUE OF ELEVATED LIFT STRETCHING 
ACROSS THE KEYS FROM THE EASTERN GULF BOTH TODAY AND TONIGHT. THIS

CENTERED OVER NEW ENGLAND...WILL EXTEND SOUTHWARD DOWN THE EAST 
COAST OF THE UNITED STATES TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS 
UNSTABLE AND MOIST...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE JUST ABOVE TWO 
INCHES. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN CONSTANT TONIGHT. THE 00Z 
KEY WEST SOUNDING ALSO REVEALS A NORTHERLY STEERING FLOW OF 5 TO 10 
KNOTS. THIS NORTHERLY STEERING FLOW IS PUSHING CONVECTION THAT 
DEVELOPED OUT OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA SEA BREEZE FRONTS TO THE SOUTH. 
THESE SHOWERS SHOULD MAKE IT TO JUST UNDER HALF OF THE ISLAND

.DISCUSSION...
CONVECTIVE CELL COVERAGE SO FAR TODAY IS NOT AS HIGH AS I THOUGHT IT 
MIGHT BE GIVEN THE DATA FROM THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING. 
APPARENTLY...A COMBINATION OF DRIER AIR BELOW 700MB AND WEAKER LAPSE 
RATES ARE LIMITING UPDRAFT GROWTH AND CONVECTIVE INTENSITY/COVERAGE 
ALONG CLOUD LINES AND BOUNDARIES. HOWEVER...THE DAY IS YOUNG...AND 
GIVEN CURRENT LOW-LEVEL WINDS OF 080/09KT PER DOPPLER VAD WIND 
PROFILER...ROBUST ISLAND TCU/CB LINES ARE STILL A GOOD BET THROUGH 
EARLY EVENING. CURRENTLY...KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS ARE SHOWING 
ISOLATED SHOWERS MOVING WEST ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...WITH MARATHON 
RECENTLY REPORTING A HEAVY SHOWER.

FORECAST REASONING FOR THIS CYCLE IS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS CYCLES. A 
WEAK BUT DEEP RIDGE WILL PERSIST OVER THE REGION FOR THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS. BY FRIDAY NIGHT...AN INCREASINGLY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN OVER THE 
CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES FEATURES A TROUGH REPLACING THE RIDGE OVER 
THE EASTERN STATES...WITH UPPER WESTERLIES REACHING THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA AND ELIMINATION OF DEEP RIDGING OVER THE KEYS. AT THE 
SURFACE...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE NORTH OF THE KEYS WILL DROP SOUTH 
TO A POSITION VERY NEAR THE KEYS BY WEDNESDAY...PERSISTING FOR A FEW 
DAYS...PERHAPS. A BAROCLINIC TROUGH WILL EVOLVE OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES AND ADJACENT WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH SOME UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE 
EVOLUTION OF THE MSL PRESSURE PATTERN NEAR THE KEYS. 

A MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER AND WEAK TO MODERATE LEVELS OF CONDITIONAL 
INSTABILITY SHOULD ENSURE A DAILY CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE SEVEN DAY PERIOD...AND FORECAST RAIN 
CHANCES WILL REMAIN CLOSE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH IS CLOSE TO 
BOTH CLIMATOLOGY AND OUTPUT FROM NUMERICAL MODELS. 
&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE NORTHEAST OR EAST BREEZES WILL PERSIST TONIGHT...BECOME 
MAINLY EAST WEDNESDAY...THEN DROP OFF WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BECOMING 
MORE VARIABLE IN DIRECTION. VARIABLE WINDS ARE FORECAST FOR THURSDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY WITH SOME PREPONDERANCE FOR A LIGHT SOUTHWEST OR 
WEST BREEZE. 3-5FT NORTHEAST SWELL WILL DEVELOP OFF UPPER KEYS 
TONIGHT...THEN GRADUALLY SUBSIDE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. NO 
ADVISORIES ARE ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME.

1050 AM EDT TUE SEP 12 2006

.DISCUSSION...
A REGIONAL SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE NORTH AMERICAN EASTERN SEABOARD TO 
THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THE RIDGE IS A LITTLE SHARPER AND 
STRONGER THAN 24 HOUR AGO...AND NORTHEAST TO EAST BREEZES HAVE 
FRESHENED ACROSS MOST OF THE SERVICE AREA. THE KEY WEST MORNING 
SOUNDING SHOWS A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WITH HIGH LEVELS OF 
MOISTURE IN THE SUBCLOUD LAYER...AND LITTLE OR NO CONVECTIVE 
INHIBITION. IN ADDITION...THE AIR IS MORE MOIST IN THE 850-700MB 
LAYER THAN 24 HOURS AGO. THE SFC-10000FT AGL MEAN WIND WAS 045/08KT.

OBSERVATIONAL TRENDS SUGGEST AN INCREASING CHANCE FOR MEASURABLE 
CONVECTIVE RAIN ACROSS THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. THE 
LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC VERTICAL WIND PROFILE IS FAVORABLE FOR 
ISLAND-INDUCED CUMULUS LINES...AS WELL AS SEA-BREEZE CONVECTION OVER 
MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA...WITH A SLOW MOVEMENT TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST.

FORECASTS HAVE BEEN UPDATED FOR THE HIGHER SURFACE WINDS AND 
INCREASED RAIN CHANCES IN THE FIRST AND SECOND PERIODS.
&&

.MARINE...
BOTH SCATTEROMETER AND C-MAN OBSERVATIONS SHOW NORTHEAST OR EAST 
WINDS OF 10-15KT OVER MOST OF THE SERVICE AREA. MOST SURFACE 
OBSERVATIONS IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL FLORIDA SHOW 1-2MB 24-HOUR 
PRESSURE RISES...INDICATIVE OF A BUILDING SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE. THIS HAS LIKELY RESULTED IN A TEMPORARY FRESHENING OF BREEZES 
ACROSS THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS AS SURFACE PRESSURES ACROSS THE 
CARIBBEAN REMAIN LOWER...AS PER USUAL.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL AFFECT THE ROUTE 
THIS MORNING...BECOMING WIDELY SCATTERED WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
THIS AFTERNOON AS CONVECTION DEVELOPS ALONG SEA BREEZES ON THE 
MAINLAND...AND IN CLOUD LINES NEAR THE KEYS. MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS 
SHOULD BE LOCALIZED AND CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL 
BE EAST NORTHEAST TO EAST SOUTHEAST AT LESS THAN 10 KNOTS.

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE CLUSTERED IN THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS MAINLY BEYOND 20 NM OF A LINE FROM ALLIGATOR REEF 
LIGHT TO COSGROVE SHOAL LIGHT AT THIS HOUR. THE STORMS ARE MOVING TO 
THE SOUTHWEST AROUND 10 KNOTS. OTHERWISE...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY 
WITH GENTLE TO LIGHT NORTHEAST WINDS ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA.

.FORECAST...
WEAK RIDGING IS EXPECTED NEAR OR OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJACENT

LATER IN THE WEEK AS TROUGH SETTLES INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA. THE LATEST 
GUIDANCE HAS THIS WEAK TROUGH LOSING DEFINITION TO OUR NORTH WITH AN 
AXIS OF DEEPER MOISTURE ALIGNED VERY CLOSE TO THE KEYS ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. A SLOW REBUILDING OF HIGHER PRESSURE TAKES 
PLACE TO OUR NORTH LATE THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. I PLAN NO 
POP ADJUSTMENTS DURING ANY PERIOD ON THE UPCOMING FORECAST...WHICH 
STAYS IS IN LINE WITH THE LOW CHANCE GFS MOS NUMBERS...AND IN LINE 
WITH CLIMO. THE LATEST ETA MOS HAS LIKELY POPS FOR THE AFTERNOON AND 
EARLY PORTIONS OF THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD AT BOTH EYW AND MTH...WHICH I 
THINK IS OVERDONE. EXPECT A CLOUD LINE ALONG THE STRETCH OF LARGER

PROBABLY ALLOW ANOTHER ONE ON WEDNESDAY...BUT DISPLACED OFF TO THE 
GULF SIDE ON A VEERED LOWER LEVEL FLOW.

&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT TO GENTLE NORTHEAST TO EAST BREEZES WILL PREVAIL THROUGH 
TONIGHT AS A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS NORTH OF THE

MINOR NORTHEASTERLY SWELL INTO THE FIRST PERIOD OFF OF THE UPPER 
KEYS. A RESEARCH VESSEL JUST TO THE SOUTHEAST OF ELBOW LIGHT HAS 
RECENTLY INDICATED A 3 TO 4 FOOT 7 SECOND SWELL ALREADY REACHING 
THOSE WATERS. FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...BREEZES WILL LIKELY 
GO LIGHT AND VARIABLE AS THE RIDGE GETS NUDGED OVER OR POSSIBLY JUST 
SOUTH OF THE KEYS. THE RIDGE WILL TAKE THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEKEND 
TO BECOME ESTABLISHED BACK TO OUR NORTH...WITH AN EVENTUAL RETURN TO

OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM EARLIER CONVECTION OVER THE EVERGLADES AND 
SOUTHWEST FLORIDA HAVE RESULTED IN SCATTERED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT. THIS TIME...MORE ACTIVITY IS BEING SEEN OVER FLORIDA 
BAY AND THE MIDDLE/UPPER KEYS. ISOLATED CELLS HAVE BEEN MOVING 
SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE LOWER KEYS. TEMPERATURES OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION 
HAVE SETTLED INTO THE LOWER 80S WITH WINDS NORTHEAST TO EAST 5 TO 10 
KNOTS. A GUST OF 28 KNOTS WAS NOTED AT LONG KEY FROM A PASSING 
THUNDERSTORM.

THE EVENING SOUNDING WAS STILL MOIST...WITH PWAT NEAR 2 
INCHES...ALTHOUGH THE DISTRIBUTION FAVORED MORE LOWER ALTITUDES 
VERSUS LAST EVENINGS. 500 MB TEMP WAS MINUS 5.9C...SAME AS SUNDAY 
EVENING. A LIGHT NORTHEAST FLOW PREVAILED THROUGH 11K FEET BEFORE 
BACKING TO LIGHT NORTHWEST. THUS CELL MOTION APPEARS TO BE HEAVILY 
PROPAGATING TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST.

WEAK SURFACE RIDGE CONTINUES IN A MOSTLY NORTH-SOUTH ALIGNMENT WITH 
AXIS A LITTLE WEST OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. UPPER TROPOSPHERIC 
RIDGE APPEARS TO BE EXTENDING NOT AS FAR NORTH AS 6HR GFS 250 MB 
PROG SUGGESTED FOR 00Z.

.FORECAST...
WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DISTRIBUTED BOTH NORTH AND 
SOUTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN...CURRENT 30 POP WILL SUFFICE AND I 
ENVISION NO CHANGES TO THE ZONE FORECAST PACKAGE. IT WILL TAKE A 
COUPLE HOURS FOR THE CONVECTION TO SUBSIDE AND MOVE AWAY FROM THE 
ISLAND CHAIN. THIS ALSO AGRESS WITH MET AND MAV GUIDANCE FROM 
12Z/18Z.

&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT NORTHEAST TO EAST WIND MAY BECOME A LITTLE MORE STEADY 
OVERNIGHT NEAR 10 KNOTS. MARINERS SHOULD BE A LITTLE CAUTIOUS DUE TO

DEEP...BUT WEAK RIDGING IS EXPECTED OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
ADJOINING WATERS FOR MUCH OF THIS WEEK. THE WEAK ANTICYCLONIC FLOW 
AND SUBSEQUENT SYNOPTIC-SCALE SUBSIDENCE WILL PREVENT ANY 
SIGNIFICANT ATMOSPHERIC DESTABILIZATION FROM THE NORMAL WEAK TO 
MODERATE CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY. IT WILL REMAIN QUITE MOIST IN THE 
SUBCLOUD LAYER WITH LITTLE CONVECTIVE INHIBITION FOR SURFACE-BASED 
PARCELS. THIS COMBINATION OF FACTORS WILL ENSURE DAILY CONVECTIVE 
CELL INITIATION BUT WITH LIMITED COVERAGE. IN ADDITION...DUE TO THE 
WEAK FLOW...CONVECTIVE INITIATION WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON 
SUBSYNOPTIC-SCALE BOUNDARY LAYER FORCING SUCH AS ISLAND AND OCEAN 
CUMULUS LINES AND CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW FROM MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA. 
THIS SCENARIO IS TYPICAL OF FLORIDA KEYS RAINY SEASON WEATHER AND 
THE FORECAST WILL THUS DEVIATE LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST 
WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO BOTH CLIMATOLOGY AND OUTPUT FROM GLOBAL 
NUMERICAL MODELS.

SHOULD THEN MOVE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS BY THE WEEKEND...WITH A 
SUBSEQUENT RETURN TO SOUTHEASTERLY BREEZES. LONG-PERIOD RESIDUAL 
ATLANTIC SWELL FROM HURRICANE FLORENCE IS BEGINNING TO ENTER THE 
STRAITS OF FLORIDA OFFSHORE THE UPPER KEYS. WAVE MODEL OUTPUT 
SUGGESTS THAT SEAS WILL BUILD UP TO 5FT OFFSHORE THE UPPER KEYS BY

NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THIS WILL HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON OUR OVERALL 
WEATHER PATTERN IN TERMS OF TEMPERATURES AND WIND SPEEDS. 
HOWEVER...THE SHIFT IN WIND DIRECTION WILL PUT US IN A MORE 
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR AFTERNOON AND EVENING CLOUD 
LINES...ESPECIALLY AROUND THE LOWER KEYS...AS WELL AS CONVECTION AND 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM THE MAINLAND MOVING INTO OUR AREA IN THE 
EVENING AND EARLY NIGHTTIME HOURS. EXCEPTING THESE TWO MECHANISMS 
CONVECTION SHOULD BE ISOLATED...SO WILL LEAVE POPS AT 30 OVER THE 
ISLANDS AND BAY AND GULF WATERS TO ACCOUNT FOR CLOUD LINES AND 
PROPAGATION OF MAINLAND ACTIVITY...AND LOWER POPS TO 20 OVER THE 
STRAITS TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
THE GFS HAS NOW BEEN CONSISTENT FOR A FEW RUNS...AND EVEN THE NAM 
HAS JOINED THE PARTY...IN DIGGING A DEEP LAYERED TROUGH THROUGH THE 
MS/AL/GA AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. AT THE SURFACE...THIS WILL 
BE REFLECTED BY THE DEVELOPMENT OF A WEAK TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE 
SOMEWHERE AROUND PENSACOLA BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. AS THE MID/UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH SUBSEQUENTLY MOVES OUT TO THE NORTHEAST...THE SURFACE 
TROUGH WILL STALL AND WASH OUT OVER NORTHERN FLORIDA LATER IN THE 
WEEK. IN OUR AREA...THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
WILL PUSH THE LOW-LEVEL RIDGE OFF TO THE EAST BY LATE 
WEDNESDAY...PLACING THE KEYS IN A COL REGION OF WEAKER EASTERLY (OR 
LIGHT AND VARIABLE) WINDS. AFTER THE TROUGH WASHES OUT THE RIDGE 
SHOULD BEGIN TO BUILD BACK IN BY THE WEEKEND...PLACING US BACK IN 
EASTERLY OR SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW.

&&

.MARINE...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL PERSIST TO OUR NORTH FOR THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS...MAINTAINING GENTLE TO LIGHT EAST NORTHEASTERLY 
BREEZES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. THEREAFTER...THE RIDGE WILL SHIFT 
EASTWARD LEAVING KEYS WATERS IN WEAKER EASTERLY OR LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE WINDS FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. NO ADVISORIES OR 
CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ARE EXPECTED.

&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS OVER MAINLAND 
SOUTH FLORIDA WILL DRIFT SLOWLY INLAND AWAY FROM THE EAST COAST 
METROPOLITAN AREA THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THESE STORMS ARE 
STILL EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE KEY WEST TO 
MIAMI AVIATION ROUTE...WITH THE EASTERN HALF OF THE ROUTE RELATIVELY 
CLEAR. THIS EVENING...WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BACK MORE OUT OF THE 
NORTHEAST THAN EAST THROUGH THE LOWER 5K FEET OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 
THIS MAY BRING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OFF THE MAINLAND INTO 
FLORIDA BAY AND THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS...MAINLY AFTER 00Z. THE

SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS THIS MORNING...WITH 
TEMPERATURES INCHING TOWARD THE UPPER 80S AND DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 
70S. WINDS ARE EAST TO SOUTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH ON LAND...AND 5 TO 
10 KT AT THE CMAN STATIONS. KBYX RADAR DETECTS ONLY A FEW SHOWERS 
ACROSS OUR AREA. THE 12Z KEYW RAOB SHOWS EAST SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS 
FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH 5000 FT AGL...GOOD LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE WITH 
A PWAT OF 2.12...AND A REASONABLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH MID-LEVEL 
LAPS RATES AROUND 6.5 C/KM AN AN LI OF -8.7.

.FORECAST...
.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE ORIENTED ROUGHLY NORTH-SOUTH DOWN 
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...PRODUCING GENTLE TO LIGHT MAINLY EAST 
BREEZES ACROSS OUR AREA. AT TIMES WINDS WILL OSCILLATE BETWEEN 
NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST...BUT SPEEDS SHOULD REMAIN NEAR 10 KT OR 
LESS ON THE WATER...AND NEAR 10 MPH OR LESS ON LAND. DEPENDING ON 
THE ORIENTATION OF LOW-LEVEL WINDS...CLOUD LINES ARE POSSIBLE ON 
EACH OF THE NEXT FEW DAYS...ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERNOON. BOUNDARIES 
FROM MAINLAND CONVECTION WILL ALSO AFFECT THE AREA IN THE LATE 
AFTERNOON THROUGH EARLY NIGHT HOURS. WILL MAINTAIN 30 POPS THROUGH 
THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH MAY DROP TO ISOLATED OVER SOME WATERS ON THE 
MORNING MARINE FORECAST UPDATE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
GFS AND NAM HAVE COME INTO A BIT OF CONSENSUS THIS MORNING REGARDING 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A TROUGH DIGGING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN STATES 
AROUND MID-WEEK...WHICH RESULTS IN AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE 
FLORIDA PANHANDLE AND SOUTHERN ALABAMA/GEORGIA BY WEDNESDAY. IF THIS 
DOES COME TO FRUITION...IT WOULD CAUSE WINDS IN OUR AREA TO BECOME 
LIGHT AND VARIABLE OR SOUTHERLY BY WEDNESDAY. WILL HOLD OFF ON 
CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED PERIOD AT MORNING UPDATE...BUT IF THE 12Z 
RUNS ARE CONSISTENT MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER CHANGES TO THE WIND FIELDS 
FROM ABOUT WEDNESDAY ON IN THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

&&

.MARINE...
THE RIDGE OVER FLORIDA WILL MAINTAIN GENTLE TO LIGHT MAINLY EAST 
BREEZES OVER FLORIDA KEYS WATERS THROUGH TUESDAY. THEREAFTER THE 
RIDGE WILL SHIFT EASTWARD...WITH WINDS BECOMING MAINLY SOUTHEAST OR 
LIGHT AND VARIABLE THROUGH THURSDAY. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY 
STATEMENTS ARE EXPECTED.

&&

.AVIATION...
SEA BREEZES WILL RESULT IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND WIDELY SCATTERED TO 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS BY THIS AFTERNOON OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. THERE 
IS THE POTENTIAL FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CLOUD LINE OVER THE LOWER 
AND MIDDLE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON THANKS TO A FAVORABLE WIND PROFILE. 
LATER THIS AFTERNOON...WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO TURN TO MORE 
NORTHEASTERLY. AS A RESULT...ACTIVITY OVER SOUTH FLORIDA SHOULD MOVE 
SOUTHWARD INTO THE FLORIDA BAY AND MAY AFFECT THE MARATHON AIRPORT 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON TO EVENING. SURFACE WINDS UNDISTURBED BY

.FORECAST...
THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE NOSING DOWN THE FLORIDA PENINSULA WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE FOR KEYS WEATHER OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS. AS NOTED ON PREVIOUS SHIFTS...BOTH THE NAM AND GFS 
HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT IN REGARDS TO PRESSURES ALONG THE GULF COAST 
EARLY THIS COMING WEEK AND THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. LATEST

MONDAY BEFORE SLIDING EAST OVER THE FL PANHANDLE (NAM) OR A MORE 
BLAND PRESSURE FIELD EVENTUALLY GIVING WAY TO WEAKER LOW PRESSURE 
NEAR APALACHICOLA BY WEDNESDAY (GFS). REGARDLESS...THE IMMEDIATE 
AREA SHOULD REMAIN INFLUENCED BY A HIGH PRESSURE AXIS REACHING IN 
FROM THE NORTHEAST DURING THOSE PERIODS. WILL CONTINUE TO HOLD OFF 
ON ANY SIGNIFICANT WIND CHANGES ON THIS FORECAST FOR ANY TIME PERIOD 
WITHIN THE GRIDS. WILL MAINTAIN A LIGHT TO GENTLE EASTERLY WIND 
FLOW...PERIODICALLY SHIFTING SLIGHTLY NORTH AND SOUTH OF THAT...FOR 
THE UPCOMING WEEK. LATEST POP GUIDANCE SHOWS NO SURPRISES. ALTHOUGH 
BOTH THE NAM AND GFS NUMBERS ARE BELOW AVERAGE OVER THE NEXT 24 
HOURS...PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY STICKS AROUND WITH SLOWLY 
MIGRATING BOUNDARIES TO KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MENTIONED. CLOUD LINES STRETCHED ALONG THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS 
SHOULD ALSO HELP FOCUS SHOWERS LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVED SOUTHWEST OVER THE 
NEARSHORE WATERS FROM MARATHON THROUGH KEY WEST...AND ARE CONTINUING 
IN THE STRAITS. THIS ACTIVITY DEVELOPED IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY EMINATING FROM EARLIER CONVECTION OVER INTERIOR 
SOUTHWEST FLORIDA. THE BOUNDARY INTERACTED WITH WHAT HAD BEEN A 
BENIGN CUMULUS LINE OVER THE EXTREME LOWER KEYS AND HAS NOW PASSED 
INTO THE STRAITS. SURFACE WINDS UP TO 10 KNOTS HAVE TEMPORARILY 
BECOME NORTHEAST IN THE WAKE OF THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY...BUT ARE 
OTHERWISE JUST NORTH OF DUE EAST ALONG THE REEF. TEMPERATURES ARE 
CURRENTLY IN THE LOWER 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S.

THE EVENING SOUNDING WAS MOIST AND UNSTABLE...WITH PWAT OF 2.00 
INCHES AND CAPE IN EXCESS OF 3000 J/KG. HOWEVER...NORTHEAST FLOW 
FROM THE SURFACE UP THROUGH 12K FEET REFLECTED A DEEPER NORTHEAST 
FLOW AROUND A LOW LEVEL RIDGE ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. 

.FORECAST...
WHILE THE ATMOSPHERE IS NEARLY AS RIPE FOR CONVECTION AS LAST 
EVENING...THERE ARE A FEW LESS BOUNDARIES ABOUT. A CHECK UPSTREAM AT 
NASSAU ALSO YIELDED NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS UPSTREAM...THUS NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE LOW LEVEL FLOW ARE EXPECTED FOR THE NEXT 
6 OR MORE HOURS. CONVECTION DID NOT ERUPT LATE IN THE EVENING IN 
METRO SOUTHEAST FLORIDA LIKE LAST EVENING. THEREFORE A REDUCTION IN 
POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE WILL BE IN ORDER FOR THE PUBLIC ZONES.

&&

.MARINE...
WHILE GUIDANCE INDICATES WINDS SHOULD BE NEARLY EASTERLY...THE 
EARLIER OUTFLOW HAD BACKED WINDS OUT OF THE NORTHEAST. WILL TWEAK

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES PREVAIL OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR 90 AND DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S 
IN A GENTLE EAST SOUTHEASTERLY BREEZE. WINDS ON LAND ARE EAST TO 
EAST SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 10 MPH...AND THE CMAN STATIONS ARE 
REPORTING MAINLY EAST WINDS 5 TO 10 KT ON THE REEF. KBYX RADAR 
DETECTS ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER OUR 
WATERS...WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IN CLOUD LINES EXTENDING WEST 
NORTHWESTWARD FROM THE LOWER KEYS.

.FORECAST...
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING DOWN THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...WHERE IT WILL REMAIN FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THIS 
WILL RESULT IN THE PERSISTENCE OF GENERALLY EASTERLY BREEZES..AT 
TIMES OSCILLATING BETWEEN NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST...OVER THE FLORIDA 
KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. LAST NIGHT OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM 
AFTERNOON CONVECTION OVER THE MAINLAND PRODUCED SOME RAIN AROUND THE 
KEYS IN THE LATE EVENING AND EARLY NIGHTTIME HOURS...AND THIS 
SCENARIO SEEMS FEASIBLE FOR TONIGHT AS WELL. LOW-LEVEL STEERING FLOW 
HAS BEEN SUFFICIENTLY EASTERLY TO KEEP CLOUD LINES AND RESULTING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS JUST NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS TODAY. 
HOWEVER...IF THE WINDS BACK A BIT TOMORROW AFTERNOON THE CLOUD LINES 
COULD PRODUCE RAINFALL OVER THE ISLANDS. GIVEN THESE FACTORS IN 
ADDITION TO AT LEAST ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALREADY 
OCCURRING THROUGHOUT THE AREA...WILL MAINTAIN LOW END CHANCE POPS 
THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH THE WEEK)...
THE THINKING FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAS BEEN THAT THE RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL PERSIST OVER MAINLAND FLORIDA WELL INTO THE NEW 
WEEK...MAINTAINING GENERALLY EASTERLY BREEZES AND NEAR CLIMO TEMPS 
AND POPS. TODAY THE 12Z RUNS OF BOTH THE GFS AND THE NAM HAVE DATA 
FIELDS IN THE EXTENDED PERIODS THAT ARE CONTAMINATED BY THE 
INFLUENCES OF DUBIOUS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS. THE GFS SPINS UP AN AREA 
OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR NEW ORLEANS BY SUNDAY MORNING...WHICH THEN 
TRACKS EASTW AND STALLS AROUND APALACHICOLA FROM MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY MORNING BEFORE FINALLY MOVING NORTHEAST. THE NAM ON THE 
OTHER HAND...HARDLY THE MODEL OF CHOICE...DEVELOPS AN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE SOMEWHERE OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN WHICH DRIFTS NORTH 
NORTHWESTWARD OVER THE YUCATAN ON TUESDAY. YESTERDAY THE NAM HAD 
THIS LOW MOVING NORTHWARD OVER CUBA AT THAT TIME.

CLEARLY...GIVEN THE INCONSISTENCIES NOT ONLY BETWEEN THE VARIOUS 
MODELS BUT FROM RUN TO RUN AS WELL...THE DEVELOPMENT OF BOTH OF 
THESE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS IS SUSPECT...AND THUS THEIR RESULTING 
DATA FIELDS OVER OUR AREA ARE SUSPECT AS WELL. IN LIGHT OF 
THIS...WILL PRESERVE THE THINKING OF THE PREVIOUS SEVERAL SHIFTS IN 
KEEPING THE RIDGE OVER FLORIDA AND MAINTAINING GENERALLY EASTERLY 
BREEZES ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. THE ONLY 
CHANGE TO THE PUBLIC FORECAST AT AFTERNOON ISSUANCE WILL BE TO 
CHANGE WIND DIRECTION TO MAINLY EAST.

&&

.MARINE...
A PERSISTENT RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER MAINLAND FLORIDA WILL 
MAINTAIN LIGHT TO GENTLE EAST NORTHEAST TO EASTERLY BREEZES OVER 
FLORIDA KEYS WATERS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. THE MARINE FORECAST 
HANDLES THIS WELL...AND ONLY SLIGHT CHANGES IN THE FIRST PERIOD 
ARE EXPECTED AT AFTERNOON ISSUANCE. TROPICAL STORM FLORENCE 
WILL PASS FAR ENOUGH EAST OF FLORIDA THAT IT WILL NOT BE A CONCERN 
FOR MARINE INTERESTS IN THE KEYS. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY 
STATEMENTS ARE EXPECTED.

&&

.AVIATION...
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE WEST ACROSS THE  
KEY WEST HALF OF THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE. SEABREEZES OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA HAS RESULTED IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND WIDELY SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE EVERGLADES. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD STAY LARGELY 
WEST OF THE MIAMI METRO AREA...AND DIE DOWN THIS EVENING. A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO POP DOWNWIND OF THE LOWER KEYS. THIS 
IS PLACING THUNDERSTORMS IN THE VICINITY OF THE KEY WEST TERMINAL. 
HOWEVER...LIGHTNING ACTIVITY WILL GENERALLY REMAIN OUTSIDE OF 5 
MILES OF THE AIRPORT...AND AIRPORT WEATHER WARNINGS WILL PROBABLY 
NOT BE NECESSARY. SURFACE WINDS UNDISTURBED BY CONVECTION OR DIURNAL

IT IS A PLEASANT SUMMER AFTERNOON IN THE FLORIDA KEYS. SKIES ARE 
PARTLY CLOUDY AND TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 90 WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID

NORTHWEST AND WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS...OUT TO SOUTH OF DRY TORTUGAS.

.FORECAST...
AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CYURRENTLY OFF THE COAST OF SOUTH CAROLINA 
WILL MOVE QUICKLY NORTHEASTWARD TONIGHT...ALLOWING A LOW LEVEL 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO BUILD IN ALONG THE FLORIDA PENINSULA BY 
TOMORROW. THIS RIDGE WILL THEN PERSIST FOR AT LEAST THE NEXT SEVERAL

RESULT OF THE RIDGE BUILDING IN...WINDS WILL BE VERY LIGHT 
TONIGHT...THEN PICK UP JUST A BIT BUT REMAIN FAIRLY LIGHT AND

LOWS LEAR 80...AND A 30 PERCENT CHANCE OF RAIN EACH PERIOD. IT BEARS 
NOTING THAT...DEPENDING ON THE LOCATION AND ORIENTATION OF THE RIDGE 
OVER FLORIDA AT ANY GIVEN TIME...WIND PROFILES MAY BECOME FAVORABLE

AN EARLY-MORNING UPPER-AIR COMPOSITE ANALYSIS SHOWS DEEP RIDGING 
OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS...WITH MUCH DRIER AIR 
THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE THAN WHAT HAS BEEN THE CASE AS OF LATE. 
IN FACT...THE GPS-MET SENSOR ON GEIGER KEY HAS INDICATED A STEADY 
DROP IN TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS... 
WITH THE MOST RECENT OBSERVATIONS THIS MORNING SHOWING VALUES LESS 
THAN 1.7 IN. CURRENTLY...KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS REVEAL ONLY 
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE SERVICE AREA...WITH A MEAN CELL MOTION 
VECTOR OF ABOUT 160/06KT. AIR TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING STEADY IN THE 
LOWER 80S...WITH DEWPOINT IN THE MID-70S. SKIES ARE CLEAR ACROSS 
MOST OF THE ARCHIPELAGO...WITH THE FULL MOON ILLUMINATING JUST A FEW 
TOWERING CUMULUS CLOUDS.

FORECAST REASONING HAS CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS FEW CYCLES. 
A NARROW AND WEAK...BUT DEEP RIDGE WILL GOVERN THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE 
PATTERN OVER THE KEYS FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS. DRY AIR IN THE LOW 
LEVELS SHOULD HELP KEEP CONVECTIVE CELL COVERAGE ISOLATED TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. THEREAFTER...LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE MAY INCREASE SLIGHTLY. 
HOWEVER...PERSISTENT...WEAK LARGE-SCALE SUBSIDENCE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE PREVAILING DEEP LAYER RIDGE SHOULD KEEP THE MOIST LAYER FAIRLY 
SHALLOW AND MID-LEVEL TEMPERATURE WARM...THEREBY LIMITING CONVECTIVE 
COVERAGE TO THE LOW-END OF THE SCATTERED RANGE...OR AROUND 30 
PERCENT. DAILY FORECAST CHALLENGES WILL INCLUDE THE PROSPECTS FOR 
SUBSYNOPTIC-SCALE FORCING MECHANISMS SUCH AS THE LOWER KEYS CUMULUS 
LINE AND KEYSWARD MOVEMENT OF MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA CONVECTIVE 
CELLS/OUTFLOWS. 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES OF 30 PERCENT WILL BE FORECAST 
FOR FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS IS CLOSE TO BOTH CLIMATOLOGY AND

.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE 
UPPER KEYS...AS WELL AS OVER THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE WATERS 
SURROUNDING THE UPPER KEYS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS WIDELY 
SEPARATED SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE 
SOUTHWEST NEAR 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE SOUTH TO 
SOUTHWEST NEAR 10 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 15 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE 
IN THE MID 80S. ONLY ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT DUE TO GENTLE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER 
WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A DEEP LAYERED ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS TONIGHT. AS A RESULT...WEAK CYCLONIC FLOW WILL BE 
REPLACED BY ANTICYCLONIC FLOW TONIGHT. THE TRANSITION FROM CLOUDY 
AND RAINY WEATHER TO MORE OF A CLIMATOLOGICAL REGIME SHOULD BEGIN 
TONIGHT. A NARROW...DEEP LAYERED ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
SHOULD BE LOCATED NEAR THE KEYS WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...BEFORE 
LIFTING NORTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN THURSDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...
LIGHT WINDS FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH 10 KFT SHOULD PREVAIL WEDNESDAY 
INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS MEANS THAT MESOSCALE FORCING MECHANISMS 
SUCH AS ISLAND CUMULUS CLOUD LINES AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL BE 
CRUCIAL IN TRIGGERING CONVECTION WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. LOW 
CHANCE POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...
WHICH IS NEAR ALL NUMERICAL MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS. THERE MAY BE 
LESS IN THE WAY OF OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES LURKING IN THE FORECAST AREA 
THURSDAY NIGHT. THEREFORE...POPS WILL BE DROPPED FROM LOW CHANCE 
CATEGORY TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
TROPICAL STORM FLORENCE...CENTERED ABOUT 935 MILES EAST OF THE 
LESSER ANTILLES...IS FORECAST TO STRENGTHEN TO A HURRICANE BEFORE 
MOVING NORTHWEST THEN NORTH...EAST OF THE BAHAMAS THIS WEEKEND. 
ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE MOST LIKELY FORECAST SCENARIO...AS USUAL...
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY INVOLVED WITH ANY LONG RANGE TROPICAL CYCLONE 
FORECAST TRACK. FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING TROPICAL STORM 
FLORENCE...PLEASE REFER TO THE LATEST PUBLIC ADVISORY ISSUED BY THE 
NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER. WINDS SHOULD BACK TO MORE OF A 
NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. THIS WOULD ALLOW 
CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS ALONG THE SOUTH FLORIDA SEA BREEZE FRONTS 
TO MOVE TO THE SOUTHWEST THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE LONG 
TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE 
BASED ON CLIMATOLOGY.

SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST SURFACE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE ON ALL KEYS 
WATERS OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY 
STATEMENTS EXPECTED TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY.

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS  
ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON...INTO THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. ISLAND 
TERMINALS MAY BE OCCASIONALLY AFFECTED BY PASSING SHOWERS OR STORMS

.DISCUSSION...
AN EARLY-MORNING UPPER-AIR COMPOSITE ANALYSIS SHOWS DEEP BUT WEAK 
CYCLONIC FLOW OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. THE 
HIGHEST CYCLONIC VORTICITY WAS ANALYZED FROM 850 TO 700MB OVER THE 
LOWER KEYS...WITH A MOVEMENT TOWARD THE NORTH-NORTHWEST DURING THE 
LAST SIX HOURS. A DEEP...WARM-CORE ANTICYCLONE WAS ANALYZED OVER THE 
WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC...CENTERED NEAR 29N/67W. SATELLITE-DERIVED 
TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER...PW...ANALYSES REVEALED A LARGE MASS OF 
AIR WITH LESS THAN 1.75 IN OF PW ACROSS THE WESTERN NORTH 
ATLANTIC...MUCH OF THE GREATER ANTILLES...AND PORTIONS OF THE 
BAHAMAS. MEANWHILE...LATEST GPS-MET DATA FROM GEIGER KEY INDICATE 
PWS APPROACHING 2.5 IN. RECENT DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW SCATTERED 
SHOWERS MOVING NORTH OVER THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS AND ADJACENT 
WATERS...AND MOVING SOUTH NEAR THE DRY TORTUGAS...WITH AN OVERALL 
CYCLONIC PATTERN EVIDENT IN THE IMAGE LOOPS.

IT LOOKS LIKE ONE MORE DAY OF CLOUDY AND RAINY WEATHER ACROSS THE 
KEYS...BEFORE CONDITIONS BEGIN IMPROVING TONIGHT. DURING THE NEXT 48 
HOURS...THE ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE WILL EXERT ITS INFLUENCE... 
REPLACING WEAK CYCLONIC FLOW WITH WEAK ANTICYCLONIC FLOW AND DRIER 
AIR THROUGH A DEEP LAYER. HOWEVER...THE KEYS WILL NOT EVER GET INTO 
A DEEP TRADE WIND FLOW BECAUSE A SERIES OF MIDLATITUDE MIGRATORY 
TROUGHS ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED STATES WILL KEEP THE WESTERLIES 
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES AND MUCH OF THE NORTHERN GULF 
BASIN. AS A RESULT...A NARROW RIDGE WILL REMAIN NEAR OR JUST NORTH 
OF THE KEYS AT MOST LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. WE DO ANTICIPATE A 
DRYING TREND BEGINNING TONIGHT...AS ANTICYCLONIC VORTICITY ADVECTION 
TAKES OVER IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...FACILITATING WEAK 
SYNOPTIC-SCALE SUBSIDENCE. VERY LIGHT WIND FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO 
10000FT AGL WILL PREVAIL WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...MEANING THAT 
SUBSYNOPTIC-SCALE FORCING MECHANISMS SUCH AS SEA BREEZES...ISLAND 
CUMULUS LINES...AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL BE VERY IMPORTANT IN 
DETERMINING INITIATION AND MOVEMENT OF CONVECTION. WE WILL MAINTAIN 
THE 12-HOUR POPS OF 30 PERCENT FOR THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT-FRIDAY NIGHT 
TIME FRAME...WHICH IS ABOVE MOST NUMERICAL MODEL OUTPUT. THE 
FORECAST FOR SATURDAY AND BEYOND IS ESSENTIALLY A CLIMATOLOGICAL 
FORECAST...WHICH IS VERY SIMILAR TO BOTH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST AND 
MODEL OUTPUT.
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST BREEZES WILL PREVAIL TODAY...AVERAGING 
10-15KT. WINDS WILL BE HIGHER IN AND NEAR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS...AND PROBABLY SOMEWHAT ERRATIC IN SPEED AND DIRECTION 
THIS AFTERNOON AS CONVECTIVE OUTFLOWS PROLIFERATE. LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE BREEZES ARE EXPECTED FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY...BEFORE GENTLE...MAINLY EAST BREEZES SET IN BY FRIDAY. 
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY SHOULD GIVE WAY TO 
SCATTERED ACTIVITY FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.
&&

.AVIATION...
OUR PATTERN WILL EVOLVE TODAY. DURING THE MORNING HOURS THE GREATEST 
LIKELIHOOD FOR +SHRA/+TSRA WILL BE IN THE VICINITY OF THE KEY WEST 
TERMINAL. BY AFTERNOON THE FOCUS WILL SHIFT TO THE MAINLAND LEG OF 
THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY WEST. TOPS WILL REACH TO FL450 WITH CELL 
MOVEMENT A SLOW DRIFT TOWARD THE NORTH. RAINFALL RATES MAY EXCEED AN 
INCH AN HOUR PRODUCING LIFR CIGS IN PRECIP IN THE CORES WHICH SHOULD 
THUS BE AVOIDED. 

WE CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE DATA OUTAGES IN OUR SYSTEM. YOU MAY STILL 
ACCESS METARS BY RADIO AND TELEPHONE.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
230 PM EDT MON SEP 4 2006

.DISCUSSION...(500-200 MB)...AS OF 200 PM...ON THE SYNOPTIC 
SCALE...A LARGE WARM CORE ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED OVER SOUTHWEST 
TEXAS. THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM CONTINUES 
TO PUSH INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. EAST OF THAT FEATURE...THE 
FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN BENEATH VERY MOIST AND UNSTABLE CYCLONIC 
FLOW...SANDWICHED BETWEEN ONE WEAK UPPER TROUGH OVER THE OVER 
SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...AND AN UPPER LOW CENTERED NEAR THE SPACE 
COAST OF FLORIDA.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...AT 200 PM...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS 
POSITIONED ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. ON THE 
REGIONAL SCALE...THE LATEST MSAS DATA HINTS THAT THE AXIS OF A WEAK 
WAVE OR LOW LEVEL TROUGH CAN BE ANALYZED OVER MARINE ZONE 75...AND 
MOVING SLOWLY WESTWARD. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN THE WETTER 
EASTERN SIDE OF THIS TROPICAL WAVE.   

.CURRENTLY...SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY OVER THE ENTIRE KEYS ISLAND 
CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS. TEMPERATURES OUTSIDE OF HEAVY SHOWERS 
AND STORMS HAVE RISEN INTO THE MIDDLE 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 
MIDDLE 70S. KEY WEST RADAR DEPICTS NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IMPACTING A GOOD PORTION OF THE KEYS AND THE ADJOINING 
ATLANTIC...FLORIDA BAY...AND GULF WATERS. THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS 
HAVE BEEN DELIVERING ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OVER 35 KNOTS...WHICH 
PROMPTED A WARNING ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS DURING THE LATE 
MORNING. WINDS OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION ARE VARIABLE BETWEEN 3 AND 10 
KNOTS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY. 

.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS (500 TO 200 MB)...UPPER LOW PRESSURE 
OVER FLORIDA WILL REMAIN STATIONARY THROUGH TOMORROW...AND GRADUALLY 
BREAK DOWN BY TOMORROW NIGHT. A WARM CORE ANTICYCLONE WILL BUILD 
ACROSS THE KEYS AND THE BAHAMAS FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC FOR 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER FULL LATITUDE TROUGH IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE DOWN ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES FOR THE WEEKEND 
AND MONDAY. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...THE LOW LEVEL 
WAVE/TROUGH AXIS NOW NEAR FORT JEFFERSON WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE WEST 
INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. THE 12Z RUNS 
OF THE NAM...UKMET...AND THE GFS TRY TO HOLD ON TO SOME TYPE OF 
SURFACE CIRCULATION DEVELOPING TO OUR WEST. THE NET RESULT OF THIS 
THAT I SEE RIGHT NOW IS FOR AN INCREASE IN SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST WINDS 
AND A CONTINUED ELEVATED PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  
THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS THROUGH 00Z WED MAINTAIN 2.00 INCH PLUS 
PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER. DEEP SOUTH TO SOUTH SOUTHEAST FLOW COULD 
BRING ALSO CLUSTERS OF STORMS/BOUNDARIES UP FROM CUBA. THE LATEST 
12Z NAM AND FWC 12 HOUR POP #S ARE BETWEEN 55 AND 66 PERCENT...WITH 
THE GFS NOW SHOWING #S IN THE 70S. WITH UPPER DYNAMICS ALREADY IN 
PLACE...I WILL HOLD WITH LOW LIKELY POPS TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. 

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BROAD LOW PRESSURE TO THE 
WEST OF THE KEYS MAY ONLY MOVE SLOWLY AWAY...BUT AN ATLANTIC RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BECOME ESTABLISHED EITHER JUST NORTH OF THE 
KEYS OR PERHAPS RIGHT OVER THE KEYS. WILL HOLD WITH VARIABLE WINDS 
FOR NOW...BUT WINDS COULD BE SOME COMPONENT OF SOUTH. MID AND UPPER 
LEVEL DRYING WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH LOWER RAIN CHANCES BEGINNING 
TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL MAINTAIN 40 PERCENT TUESDAY NIGHT...AND KEEP LOW 
CHANCE OR CLIMO POPS FOR WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...LOOKS TO BE A CONTINUED QUIET PERIOD 
IN THE WEATHER WITH AN ATLANTIC RIDGE REMAINING JUST TO NORTH OF THE 
KEYS. RAIN CHANCES ARE CLOSE TO CLIMO...AND THATS WHAT WE HAVE 
GOING. EXPECT LIGHT EAST TO NORTHEAST WINDS WITH THE AFTERNOON 
MESOSCALE CUMULUS LINES AND DRIFTING SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND 
CONVECTION. 

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL REMAIN JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS. LATEST 12 HOUR GUIDANCE 
#S FOR THE PERIOD HAVE DROPPED DOWN AGAIN...BUT WILL HOLD WITH 
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS DUE TO INCONSISTENCIES IN EACH RUN.

TUESDAY. MARINERS WILL ENCOUNTER EPISODES OF SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS 
SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON. WILL SEE IMPROVED BOATING CONDITIONS FOR WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY. 

THE BIGGEST HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE OCCASIONAL YET DEADLY CLOUD TO WATER LIGHTNING 
STRIKES...AND LOCALLY SEAS/BAY WATERS ASSOCIATED WITH ISOLATED WIND 
GUSTS OVER 30 KNOTS. PLEASE STAY TUNED TO NOAA WEATHER RADIO FOR THE 
LATEST MARINE STATEMENTS AND POSSIBLE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL 
WEATHER SERVICE OFFICE IN KEY WEST.

.AVIATION...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE AREA NEAR THE EAST COAST OF 
FLORIDA WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR A WELL ABOVE NORMAL CHANCE OF RAIN 
THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY. 

LONG-LIVED MVFR CONDITIONS OR LOWER ARE LIKELY AT KEYW AND KMTH THIS 
AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD 
DECREASE IN INTENSITY AND COVERAGE NEAR THE KEYS BEFORE MIDNIGHT. 
VFR CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH TONIGHT. THERE IS A 
GOOD POSSIBILITY OF LONG-LIVED MVFR CONDITIONS OR LOWER AT KEYW AND 
KMTH LATE TUESDAY MORNING INTO EARLY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. 

IFR OF LOWER CONDITIONS WILL COVER AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT OF THE 
KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING. SHOWERS AND

930 AM EDT MON SEP 4 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB)...AS OF 900 
AM...ON THE SYNOPTIC SCALE...A LARGE WARM CORE ANTICYCLONE IS 
CENTERED OVER SOUTHWEST TEXAS AND NORTH CENTRAL MEXICO. THE EASTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THIS HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PUSHING INTO THE EASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO. TO THE EAST OF THAT...AN UPPER TROUGH IS CENTERED 
NEAR THE EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA COAST. THE FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN BENEATH 
VERY MOIST CYCLONIC FLOW DOMINATING MUCH OF THE TROPOSPHERE.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...AT 900 AM...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS 
POSITIONED ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. ON THE 
REGIONAL SCALE...THE LATEST MSAS DATA HINTS THAT THE AXIS OF A WEAK 
WAVE OR LOW LEVEL TROUGH CAN BE ANALYZED CROSSING THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS AND THE MIDDLE KEYS AT THIS TIME.  

.CURRENT...AS OF 900 AM..OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS...TEMPERATURES HAVE 
CLIMBED INTO THE MIDDLE 80S WITH DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 
70S. DURING THE PAST HOUR...KEY WEST RADAR HAS SHOWN AN INCREASING 
TREND IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE...WITH SHOWERS AND STORMS 
BLOSSOMING ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS FROM CRAIG KEY TO DRY TORTUGAS 
OUT 60 NM. THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THIS AREA IS NOW PUSHING INTO THE 
MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. OTHER SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE PUSHING TOWARDS 
THE UPPER KEYS FROM THE EAST. THE MORNING 12Z SOUNDING...LIKE 
YESTERDAY MORNING IS VERY UNSTABLE WITH NO CONVECTIVE INHIBITION AND
PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER) AT 2.11 INCHES. 

.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS (500-200 MB). TODAY...THE UPPER 
LOW/TROUGH NEAR FLORIDA WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY...BEFORE 
GRADUALLY BREAKING DOWN LATER IN THE DAY TOMORROW. SYNOPTIC SCALE 
LIFT COMBINED WITH...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ABOVE 2.00 
INCHES...AND ENHANCED 200 MB DIVERGENCE...WILL ALLOW FOR LOTS OF 
CELL GROWTH TO REACH THE EQUILIBRIUM LEVEL BETWEEN 45 AND 50 KFT. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB). TODAY...THE MAIN AXIS 
OF THE WEAK WAVE WILL SLIDE WEST OF THE KEYS BY TONIGHT. THIS WEAK 
WAVE WILL ALSO AID IN PROVIDING DECENT LOW AND MID LEVEL LIFT OVER 
THE KEYS AND THE ADJOINING WATERS. IN ADDITION...A LIGHT NORTHEAST 
PROFILE AHEAD OF THE WAVE AXIS THIS MORNING WILL ALLOW FOR 
ENHANCEMENT OF CLOUD-LINES OVER THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS. ALL OF 
THESE THINGS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO HIGH PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TODAY. THE LATEST AVAILABLE 12Z GFS AND NAM MODEL 
GUIDANCE THROUGH 00Z TUESDAY IS ALSO SUGGESTING THAT 12 HOUR POPS 
SHOULD BE BETWEEN 75 AND 90 PERCENT. THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY 
CURRENT RADAR TRENDS. THE ONLY INHIBITING FACTOR FOR THESE HIGH #S  
WILL BE THE THICK ALTO AND NIMBOSTRATUS...AS WELL AS ALTOCUMULUS 
DECKS THAT WILL SPREAD OUT FROM NUMEROUS DECAYING CONVECTIVE 
CELLS...POSSIBLY ALLOWING SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THE ATMOSPHERE IS 
ABLE TO SUPPORT CONVECTION. FORECAST IS IN TRACK.

LOCALLY SEAS/BAY WATERS ASSOCIATED WITH ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OVER 35 
KNOTS. PLEASE STAY TUNED TO NOAA WEATHER RADIO FOR THE LATEST MARINE 
STATEMENTS AND POSSIBLE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE 
OFFICE IN KEY WEST.

&&

.AVIATION...INTERMITTENT MVFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED AT KEYW AND KMTH 
THIS MORNING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE IN INTENSITY 
AND COVERAGE NEAR THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. AS A RESULT...THE CHANCE 
OF LONG-LIVED MVFR CONDITIONS OR LOWER AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL 
INCREASE TO ABOUT 50 PERCENT THIS AFTERNOON. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DECREASE IN INTENSITY AND COVERAGE NEAR THE KEYS 
THIS EVENING. VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH TONIGHT.

SIMILAR TO THE LAST FEW DAYS...A DEEP...MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
345 AM EDT MON SEP 4 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
TEMPERATURES ARE CURRENTLY IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S ALONG THE 
KEYS ISLAND CHAIN...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S. MOSTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES HAVE PREVAILED OVERNIGHT OVER THE KEYS AND ADJACENT COASTAL 
WATERS. KBYX RADAR HAS DETECTED ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM 
OVER THE KEYS WATERS EARLY THIS MORNING. MOST OF THE ACTIVITY HAS 
BEEN CONCENTRATED ALONG A BOUNDARY PROPAGATING WESTWARD OVER THE 
WATERS SOUTH OF THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS...AND ALSO DEVELOPING 
ACTIVITY OVER THE STRAITS BEYOND 30 MILES SOUTH OF DRY TORTUGAS. 
OUTSIDE OF BOUNDARIES AND CONVECTION...CMAN PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN 
REPORTING EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS...WHILE LAND 
LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN AVERAGING MAINLY EAST WINDS OF 5 TO 10 MPH. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...
A WEAK LOW TO MID LEVEL TROUGH WILL LINGER OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND 
THE KEYS THROUGH TUESDAY. IN ADDITION...THE KEYS WILL REMAIN 
SANDWICHED BETWEEN TWO UPPER LEVEL LOWS...ONE OVER THE NORTHEASTERN 
GULF AND THE OTHER OVER THE BAHAMAS. AMPLE MOISTURE AS WELL AS 
PLENTY OF INSTABILITY WILL RESULT IN EPISODES OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE KEPT AT 50 
PERCENT FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WITH TIMING...AND 
MAY INDEED NEED TO BE INCREASED AS THE TIME APPROACHES. TEMPERATURES 
TODAY AND TONIGHT MAY BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES COOLER THAN NORMAL DUE 
TO CLOUD COVER AND CONVECTION. A GENERAL EASTERLY WIND DIRECTION 
SHOULD PREVAIL...HOWEVER FLUCTUATIONS WITH THE LOCATION OF THE 
TROUGH AS WELL AS OUTFLOW AND BOUNDARIES MAY CREATE A CHAOTIC WIND 
FIELD ALBEIT LIGHT. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
A DRIER AIRMASS SHOULD ENTER OVER THE KEYS FROM THE ATLANTIC BY 
WEDNESDAY...AS HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD IN FROM THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. AT THIS TIME...NEAR CLIMO RAIN CHANCES 
(AROUND 30 PERCENT) WILL BE KEPT FOR THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT TIME PERIOD. FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...MODELS INDICATE A 
SLIGHT BACKING OF WINDS TO NORTHEAST...POSSIBLY IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
A WEAK SURFACE. NORTHEAST WINDS FAVOR SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL RAIN 
CHANCES...HENCE I PLAN ON MAINTAINING THE 40 PERCENT RAIN CHANCES 
FOR NEXT WEEKEND.  
&&

.MARINE...
A GENERAL EASTERLY WIND DIRECTION WITH SPEEDS AROUND 10 KNOTS WILL 
PREVAIL TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE MAIN CONCERN FOR MARINERS WILL BE 
RAPIDLY CHANGING CONDITIONS DUE TO OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES AND 
THUNDERSTORMS...WITH ASSOCIATED GUSTY WINDS AROUND 30 KNOTS AND 
LOCALLY ROUGH SEAS. WINDS MAY GO VARIABLE OR EVEN SOUTHERLY LATE 
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. EAST WINDS WILL RETURN ONCE THE RIDGE BUILDS 
BACK IN FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC SOMETIME WEDNESDAY. WIND SPEEDS 
SHOULD REMAIN AT 10 KNOTS OR LESS THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
&&

.AVIATION...
PREVAILING VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AT EYW...MTH...AND ALONG 
EYW-MIA AIRWAYS EARLY THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...SIMILAR TO THE LAST 
FEW DAYS...SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE SHOULD INCREASE 08-12Z 
AS OCEAN CUMULUS LINES PROLIFERATE IN THE LIGHT NOCTURNAL EASTERLY 
FLOW. A DEEP...MOIST...VORTICITY-RICH AIR MASS OVER THE AREA WILL 
FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS... 
WITH AREAS OF STRATIFORM RAIN INCREASING IN THE AFTERNOON AS THICK 
ALTOSTRATUS/NIMBOSTRATUS/ALTOCUMULUS DECKS SPREAD OUT FROM NUMEROUS 
DECAYING CONVECTIVE CELLS...WITHIN A VERY MOIST MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE. 
IFR EPISODES WILL THUS INCREASE IN COVERAGE AND FREQUENCY DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AT EYW...MTH...AND ESPECIALLY ALONG THE EYW-MIA CORRIDOR. 
SURFACE WINDS WILL START OUT EASTERLY...FROM 070-110...AT 
5-10KT...BUT WILL BECOME VARIABLE AS DIURNAL/CONVECTIVE CIRCULATIONS 
DOMINATE LATER TODAY.

1020 PM EDT SUN SEP 3 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE IS ANALYZED AS A BROAD SYSTEM WITH THE 
RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING WEST INTO CENTRAL OR SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA AT 
THIS TIME. MEANWHILE...KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE BEEN DISRUPTED THROUGH 
THE AFTERNOON UNTIL NOW DUE TO EARLIER LARGE CONVECTIVE CLUSTERS 
JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS AND KEYS WATERS WHICH SENT OUTFLOW WINDS 
SOUTHWARD OVER THE AREA. WINDS ALOFT FROM 5 THSD FT AGL ON UPWARD 
INTO THE CIRRUS LEVEL ARE NOW FROM THE NORTH AND THIS HAS SENT 
STRATIFORM CLOUDS AND ASSOCIATED RAIN AREAS SOUTH OVER THE KEYS 
FROM THE MAIN CONVECTIVE HOT SPOTS...AND THIS HAS DRIVEN SURFACE 
WINDS FROM THE NORTH AS WELL. LATEST C-MAN OBSERVATIONS SHOW SURFACE 
WINDS GRADUALLY HAVING TURNED TO NE OR ENE...WITH SPEEDS HAVING 
SETTLED DOWN NEAR 10 KT IN AREAS WHERE EARLIER OUTFLOW GUSTS WERE 
SEEN. DURING THE LAST HOUR OR SO...MOST RAIN AREAS OVER THE KEYS 
HAVE FINALLY FIZZLED AS THE LOCAL AIRMASS HAS TEMPORARILY 
STABILIZED...ALTHOUGH PLENTY OF CONVECTION AND RAIN IS STILL ONGOING 
OVER THE GULF W-N-AND WELL NE OF DRY TORTUGAS. ALSO..A LARGE AREA OF 
STILL-DEVELOPING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS SEEN ON RADAR OVER THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS OFFSHORE FROM THE UPPER KEYS...AND OVER BAHAMA 
WATERS FROM WEST OF ANDROS ISLAND DOWN TO THE NORTH CENTRAL COAST OF 
CUBA. IR SATELLITE CONTINUES TO SUGGEST A REGION OF SYNOPTIC SCALE 
LIFT AIDING CONVECTIVE AND HIGH CLOUD DEVELOPMENT OVER THE GENERAL 
REGION OF THE SE GULF...FLORIDA KEYS...SOUTH FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...WESTERN BAHAMAS. 

.FORECAST...
PUBLIC ZONES WILL BE UPDATED FOR TRANSITIONAL WORDING...KEEPING 
A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD 
AT EITHER 40 OR 50 PCT. CURRENT STABILIZED AIR OVER THE KEYS SHOULD
RECOVER IN SEVERAL HOURS. ALSO...LATEST GFS MODEL DEPICTS A SOUTH-TO-
NORTH ORIENTED LOW TO MID LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STRAITS TO 
NORTH CUBA...AND THIS SEEMS TO DEFINE THE WEST EDGE OF THE 
DEVELOPING CONVECTION NOW ONGOING OUT THERE. GFS SHOWS THIS FEATURE
DRIFTING WEST TO JUST OFF THE UPPER KEYS BY 8 AM. 
&&

.MARINE...
SURFACE WINDS ARE TURNING AROUND TOWARD EAST AS EXPECTED...AND
IT LOOKS LIKE SPEEDS WILL BE CLOSE TO THE EXPECTED 10 KT OVERNIGHT
EXCEPT OF COURSE NEAR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WHERE STRONGER WINDS
ARE POSSIBLE. 
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE 
ROUTE...WITH IFR VISIBILITIES POSSIBLE IN STRONGER CELLS. MULTIPLE 
CLOUD LAYERS WILL BE PRESENT ABOVE ABOUT 6000 FT AGL...WITH CEILINGS 
ANYWHERE UP TO 25000 FT AGL. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE MAINLY 
NORTHEAST AT LESS THAN 10 KT...BECOMING EAST BY MORNING.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
215 PM EDT SUN SEP 3 2006

.DISCUSSION...AS OF 200 PM...ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...UPPER LOW 
PRESSURE IS SPINNING NORTH OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...WHILE ANOTHER 
SLIGHTLY BETTER ORGANIZED UPPER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS TRUDGING 
SLOWLY WESTWARD OVER FAR EASTERN CUBA. THE FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN 
BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS...BENEATH DEEP MOIST CYCLONIC FLOW THROUGH 
THE ENTIRE TROPOSPHERE. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...A WEAK WAVE IS 
LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS...WITH A SURFACE RIDGE POSITIONED 
ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN A WEAK AND QUITE 
UNSTABLE LOWER AND MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE. 

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...LATEST KEY WEST RADAR IMAGERY DEPICTS 
SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS WITH SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS 
THE GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE SEVEN MILE BRIDGE TO DRY TORTUGAS 
NATIONAL PARK. ELSEWHERE...A LARGE AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE 
RAINFALL WITH SCATTERED EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS IS PRESENT OVER THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS FROM TENNESSEE REEF LIGHT TO COSGROVE SHOAL LIGHT. 
TEMPERATURES ARE ONLY NEAR 80 DEGREES AT RAIN COOLED LOCATIONS IN 
THE LOWER KEYS...BUT NEAR 90 IN PORTIONS OF THE UPPER AND MIDDLE 
KEYS. WINDS OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION ARE EAST BETWEEN 5 AND 10 KNOTS. 
WIND GUSTS BETWEEN 20 AND 33 KNOTS WERE RECORDED BY MARINE RECORDING 
STATIONS IN EARLIER SHOWERS AND STORMS THAT MOVED ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
REEF BETWEEN SOMBRERO KEY LIGHT AND PULASKI SHOAL LIGHT.

.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500 TO 200 MB)...TONIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY...THE UPPER LOW NOW CENTERED OVER EASTERN CUBA WILL MOVE 
SLOWLY WESTWARD TOWARDS THE KEYS...AND THEN HANG CLOSE BY THE KEYS 
ON LABOR DAY AND MONDAY NIGHT BEFORE BREAKING DOWN OVERHEAD BY LATE 
TUESDAY. AS A RESULT...THE KEYS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BENEATH VERY 
DEEP MOISTURE WITH AMPLE 200 MB DIFFLUENCE. BOTH 12Z NAM AND GFS 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO INDICATE ABOVE AVERAGE INSTABILITY 
WITH PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) NEAR 2.00 INCHES. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...A TROPICAL ANTICYCLONE IS FORECAST TO 
NOSE  WESTWARD OVER THE KEYS FROM THE BAHAMAS ON WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER 
SHORTWAVE OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS WILL RESULT IN AMPLIFICATION OF THE 
LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN CONUS FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK AND 
INTO THE WEEKEND. THE FORECASTED RIDGING WILL ALLOW FOR ADVECTION OF 
DRIER MID AND UPPER LEVEL AIR OVER THE KEYS. 

IN THE LOW AND MID-LEVELS...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...THE WEAK 
WAVE/TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS/EASTERN CUBA WILL MIGRATE 
WESTWARD TO ACROSS THE KEYS BY TOMORROW MORNING. THE 12Z GFS LOOKS 
TOO AGGRESSIVE...SPINNING UP A SURFACE LOW IN THE WESTERN STRAITS 
TOMORROW MORNING...WHILE THE 12Z NAM AND UKMET SHOW A WAVE/TROUGH 
PASSING THROUGH THE STRAITS TOMORROW NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY. 
REGARDLESS OF THAT...THE RIDGE NEARBY WILL REMAIN QUITE WEAK...SO 
WIND DIRECTION COULD BE VARIABLE...BUT WILL HOLD WITH A LIGHT AND 
EASTERLY DIRECTION FOR NOW. WILL LIKELY SEE TCU/LINES BUILD UP OVER 
THE ISLANDS WITH PROLONGED ANY BREAKS OF SUNSHINE. WILL KEEP LIKELY 
POPS IN PLACE FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE NIGHT...AS BOUNDARIES OVER 
THE PENINSULA ARE APPROACHING THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS. ACTIVITY 
MAY DECREASE IN COVERAGE LATER TONIGHT WHEN THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE 
WORKED OVER AGAIN. 

THE UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT HIGHER RAIN AND 
THUNDER CHANCES FOR LABOR DAY THROUGH TUESDAY...SO WILL HOLD WITH 
THE INHERITED GOOD CHANCE POPS UNTIL FUTURE MODEL RUNS PROVIDE 
BETTER CONSISTENCY. THIS IS BELOW THE 12 HOUR GFS POPS...AND 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE THE 12 HOUR NAM POPS FOR THE PERIOD. 

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...12Z GFS NOW INDICATES THAT THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BE EITHER OVER OR JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...BEFORE SLIDING BACK OVER SOUTH FLORIDA 
THURSDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE 12Z NAM AND GFS MODELS ARE 
DEPICTING A WEAK LOW OR WELL DEFINED WAVE IN THE VICINITY OF 
HISPANIOLA BY FRIDAY MORNING...AND IT COULD APPROACH THE KEYS BY 
LATE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. DRIER MID AND UPPER LEVEL AIR AHEAD OF 
THIS SYSTEM MAY LOOKS LIKE IT WILL RESULT IN 12 HR POP #S RETURNING 
BACK TO NEAR CLIMATOLOGY FOR THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT 
PERIODS. THE LATEST 12 HOUR POP #S FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
CONTINUE TO SHOW LOWER POP #S AHEAD OF THIS WAVE...WITH #S BETWEEN 
20 AND 35 PERCENT. GIVEN THE CONTINUED TREND DOWNWARD IN POPS FOR 
THE PERIOD...WILL LOWER RAIN CHANCES TO NEAR CLIMO...AND MAINTAIN 
THE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS WE ALREADY HAVE IN PLACE FOR THE 
WEEKEND.
 
&&

.MARINE...MARINERS WILL ENCOUNTER SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS ALL THE WATERS THIS EVENING...WITH 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED TOMORROW. THE BIGGEST 
HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
OCCASIONAL YET DEADLY CLOUD TO WATER LIGHTNING STRIKES...AND LOCALLY 
SEAS/BAY WATERS ASSOCIATED WITH ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OVER 30 KNOTS. 
PLEASE STAY TUNED TO NOAA WEATHER RADIO FOR THE LATEST MARINE 
STATEMENTS AND POSSIBLE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB)...AS OF 900 
AM...ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...A NEARLY STATIONARY UPPER LOW PRESSURE 
IS SPINNING NORTH OF WESTERN CUBA AND THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...WHILE 
ANOTHER SLIGHTLY BETTER DEVELOPED UPPER LOW PRESSURE PRESSURE SYSTEM 
IS TRUDGING SLOWLY WESTWARD OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. THE FLORIDA 
KEYS REMAIN BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS...BENEATH CYCLONIC FLOW WITH 
DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE ADVECTION THROUGH THE ENTIRE TROPOSPHERE. 
PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) ABOVE TWO INCHES IS INDICATED BY THE 
MORNING SOUNDING. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...A WEAK WAVE IS 
LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. A SURFACE RIDGE IS POSITIONED ACROSS 
SOUTH FLORIDA. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN A WEAK AND QUITE UNSTABLE 
LOWER AND MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE. 

CURRENTLY...AS OF 900 AM...THE 12Z MORNING SOUNDING WAS VERY 
UNSTABLE IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE ATMOSPHERE...WITH PWAT 
(PRECIPITABLE WATER) AT 2.16 INCHES. THE ALSO SOUNDING INDICATES 
VERY MOIST AND LIGHT SOUTHEAST FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 10 
KFT...WITH NEARLY NORTH FLOW FROM 10 KFT UP TO 40 KFT. KEY WEST 
RADAR IS PRESENTLY INDICATING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS 25 TO 60 NM SOUTH OF EAST TURTLE SHOAL 
LIGHT TO DRY TORTUGAS LIGHT. WINDS ALONG THE REEF ARE SOUTHEAST AT 
10 KNOTS...AND NEAR 10 MPH OVER THE ISLANDS. TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN 
INTO THE MIDDLE 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MIDDLE 70S.  

.FORECAST...TODAY...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...THE UPPER LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE 
SLOWLY WESTWARD...REACHING THE WESTERN BAHAMAS BY TONIGHT.  

.IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...WITH THE PROXIMITY OF THE SURFACE RIDGE 
JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS...AND THE MESOSCALE AFFECTS FROM HEATING OVER 
THE ISLANDS AND THE MAINLAND...WILL ALLOW FOR WELL DEVELOPED 
TOWERING CUMULUS LINES ALONG THE ENTIRE ISLAND CHAIN. GIVEN THE 
AFOREMENTIONED UPPER DYNAMICS...THESE LINES OF SHOWERS AND STORMS

THE IMMEDIATE SURROUNDING WATERS...ALLOWING FOR A GREAT DEAL OF 
COVERAGE. HAVE INHERITED LIKELY POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND 
THE LATEST 06Z GFS AND NAM 12 HOUR POPS SUPPORT THE LIKELY CATEGORY. 
WILL JUST REMOVE TRANSITIONAL WORDING ON THE MORNING UPDATE AND ALSO 
INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME WIND GUSTS WITHIN WELL DEVELOPED

50 KFT. 

&&

.MARINE...WE HAD A SHIP REPORT OF 20 KNOTS WITH 3 TO 4 FOOT SEAS 
FROM A SHIP LIKELY ENCOUNTERING A HEAVIER SHOWER MOVING THROUGH THE 
OUTER FLORIDA STRAITS. THE CURRENT PATTERN SUPPORTS HIGHER WINDS AND 
SEAS IN THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS...AND WILL CONTINUE TO INDICATE 
THIS FOR THE FIRST PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. BOATERS WILL ENCOUNTER 
SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS 
KEYS WATERS TODAY. THE BIGGEST HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FREQUENT YET DEADLY CLOUD TO WATER LIGHTNING 
STRIKES...AND LOCALLY SEAS/BAY WATERS ASSOCIATED WITH ISOLATED WIND 
GUSTS OVER 30 KNOTS. OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS THIS

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
930 AM EDT SUN SEP 3 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB)...AS OF 900 
AM...ON THE SYNOPTIC SCALE...A LARGE WARM CORE ANTICYCLONE IS 
CENTERED OVER SOUTHWEST TEXAS AND NORTH CENTRAL MEXICO. THE EASTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THIS HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PUSHING INTO THE EASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO. TO THE EAST OF THAT...AN UPPER TROUGH IS CENTERED 
NEAR THE EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA COAST. THE FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN BENEATH 
VERY MOIST CYCLONIC FLOW DOMINATING MUCH OF THE TROPOSPHERE.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...AT 900 AM...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS 
POSITIONED ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. ON THE 
REGIONAL SCALE...THE LATEST MSAS DATA HINTS THAT THE AXIS OF A WEAK 
WAVE OR LOW LEVEL TROUGH CAN BE ANALYZED CROSSING THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS AND THE MIDDLE KEYS AT THIS TIME.  

.CURRENT...AS OF 900 AM..OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS...TEMPERATURES HAVE 
CLIMBED INTO THE MIDDLE 80S WITH DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 
70S. DURING THE PAST HOUR...KEY WEST RADAR HAS SHOWN AN INCREASING 
TREND IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE...WITH SHOWERS AND STORMS 
BLOSSOMING ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS FROM CRAIG KEY TO DRY TORTUGAS 
OUT 60 NM. THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THIS AREA IS NOW PUSHING INTO THE 
MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. OTHER SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE PUSHING TOWARDS 
THE UPPER KEYS FROM THE EAST. THE MORNING 12Z SOUNDING...LIKE 
YESTERDAY MORNING IS VERY UNSTABLE WITH NO CONVECTIVE INHIBITION AND
PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER) AT 2.11 INCHES. 

.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS (500-200 MB). TODAY...THE UPPER 
LOW/TROUGH NEAR FLORIDA WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY...BEFORE 
GRADUALLY BREAKING DOWN LATER IN THE DAY TOMORROW. SYNOPTIC SCALE 
LIFT COMBINED WITH...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ABOVE 2.00 
INCHES...AND ENHANCED 200 MB DIVERGENCE...WILL ALLOW FOR LOTS OF 
CELL GROWTH TO REACH THE EQUILIBRIUM LEVEL BETWEEN 45 AND 50 KFT. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB). TODAY...THE MAIN AXIS 
OF THE WEAK WAVE WILL SLIDE WEST OF THE KEYS BY TONIGHT. THIS WEAK 
WAVE WILL ALSO AID IN PROVIDING DECENT LOW AND MID LEVEL LIFT OVER 
THE KEYS AND THE ADJOINING WATERS. IN ADDITION...A LIGHT NORTHEAST 
PROFILE AHEAD OF THE WAVE AXIS THIS MORNING WILL ALLOW FOR 
ENHANCEMENT OF CLOUD-LINES OVER THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS. ALL OF 
THESE THINGS ARE CONTRIBUTING TO HIGH PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TODAY. THE LATEST AVAILABLE 12Z GFS AND NAM MODEL 
GUIDANCE THROUGH 00Z TUESDAY IS ALSO SUGGESTING THAT 12 HOUR POPS 
SHOULD BE BETWEEN 75 AND 90 PERCENT. THIS IS ALSO SUPPORTED BY 
CURRENT RADAR TRENDS. THE ONLY INHIBITING FACTOR FOR THESE HIGH #S  
WILL BE THE THICK ALTO AND NIMBOSTRATUS...AS WELL AS ALTOCUMULUS 
DECKS THAT WILL SPREAD OUT FROM NUMEROUS DECAYING CONVECTIVE 
CELLS...POSSIBLY ALLOWING SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE THE ATMOSPHERE IS 
ABLE TO SUPPORT CONVECTION. FORECAST IS IN TRACK.

&&

.MARINE...MARINERS WILL ENCOUNTER WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS ALL THE WATERS THROUGH THIS EVENING. THE 
BIGGEST HAZARDS ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE OCCASIONAL YET DEADLY CLOUD TO WATER LIGHTNING STRIKES...AND 
LOCALLY SEAS/BAY WATERS ASSOCIATED WITH ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OVER 35 
KNOTS. PLEASE STAY TUNED TO NOAA WEATHER RADIO FOR THE LATEST MARINE 
STATEMENTS AND POSSIBLE WARNINGS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE 
OFFICE IN KEY WEST.

&&

.AVIATION...INTERMITTENT MVFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED AT KEYW AND KMTH 
THIS MORNING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE IN INTENSITY 
AND COVERAGE NEAR THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. AS A RESULT...THE CHANCE 
OF LONG-LIVED MVFR CONDITIONS OR LOWER AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL 
INCREASE TO ABOUT 50 PERCENT THIS AFTERNOON. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DECREASE IN INTENSITY AND COVERAGE NEAR THE KEYS 
THIS EVENING. VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH TONIGHT.

SIMILAR TO THE LAST FEW DAYS...A DEEP...MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE 
KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE WILL FACILITATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF NUMEROUS 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE THIS MORNING INTO EARLY THIS 
AFTERNOON. IFR OF LOWER CONDITIONS COULD COVER AS MUCH AS 50 PERCENT 
OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THIS AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION...AREAS OF 
STRATIFORM RAIN WILL INCREASE IN COVERAGE THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE 
KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE AS THICK ALTOSTRATUS/NIMBOSTRATUS/ALTOCUMULUS 
CLOUD DECKS SPREAD OUT FROM NUMEROUS DECAYING CONVECTIVE CELLS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
LATE AFTERNOON OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES THAT MIGRATED FROM THUNDERSTORMS 
OVER KEYS GULF OF MEXICO WATERS...HAVE MOSTLY DISSIPATED AS OF THIS 
HOUR. AS A RESULT...WINDS OVER MOST KEYS ISLANDS, BAY AND ATLANTIC 
WATERS...HAVE TURNED TO A GENERAL EASTERLY DIRECTION THE PAST COUPLE 
OF HOURS. THIS IS IN ACCORDANCE WITH MODEL INDICATIONS THAT THE 
SURFACE SYNOPTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WOULD SHIFT SLIGHTLY AND SLOWLY 
NORTH OF THE KEYS THIS EVENING. ONE EXCEPT SO FAR IS KEYS WESTERN 
WATERS...SUCH AS AROUND DRY TORTUGAS...WHERE A WEAK MESO HIGH CENTER 
IS KEEPING WINDS LIGHT AND VARIABLE. ALSO...THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS 
EAST OF THE UPPER KEYS HAVE SENT THEIR OWN OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES 
WESTWARD...CREATING STRONGER EAST WINDS (AROUND 15 KT) AT NEARSHORE 
AND REEF SITES OF THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS THAN SUPPORTED BY 
SYNOPTIC PRESSURE GRADIENT. IR SATELLITE CONTINUES TO SHOW A LARGE 
AREA OF THICK MID AND HIGH CLOUDINESS BEING CREATED OVER THE NW 
BAHAMAS, ADJACENT ATLANTIC AND FLORIDA PENINSULA, AND SPEWING SOUTH 
OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS. WITHIN THIS AREA...RADARS AND THE LIGHTNING 
DETECTION CONFIRM CONTINUED THUNDERSTORM FORMATION. THIS AREA SEEMS 
TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL WIND PATTERN. AT THE SURFACE 
THE WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS IS THE MAIN FEATURE SEEN. 
 
.FORECAST...
NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES IS NEEDED. INTERMEDIATE MODEL RUNS...AND
CURRENT TRENDS...INDICATE A CONTINUED GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FORMING OVERNIGHT.
&&

.MARINE...
SURFACE WINDS ARE ALREADY BECOMING MAINLY EAST AS EXPECTED...AS THE
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS NORTH OF THE KEYS. GUSTY 
ERRATIC WINDS ARE STILL POSSIBLE, HOWEVER, NEAR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WHICH ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING EAST OF THE UPPER KEYS
...AND MAY FORM ELSEWHERE OVER THE KEYS AREA OVERNIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE

.DISCUSSION...(500-200 MB)...AS OF 200 PM...A SHARP AND NARROW 
POSITIVELY TILTED TROUGH EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL PENNSYLVANIA SOUTH 
SOUTHWESTWARD ALL THE WAY TO SOUTHERN MEXICO. AN UPPER LOW NOW 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS IS CONTINUING TO MOVE WESTWARD. 
AS A RESULT...THE FLORIDA KEYS ARE BETWEEN THESE TWO SYNOPTIC SCALE 
FEATURES...BENEATH DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE AND AMPLE 200 MB 
DIVERGENCE. THIS HAS ENABLED EPISODIC OUTBREAKS OF SCATTERED TO 
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE ISLANDS AND 
ADJOINING WATERS. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...AS OF 200 PM...THE REMNANTS OF TS 
ERNESTO IS LOCATED OVER CENTRAL MARYLAND. THIS SYSTEM IS TRAILING A 
COLD FRONT SOUTHWARD TO WEAK LOW PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL GEORGIA. 
FARTHER TO THE SOUTH. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...A TROUGH EXTENDS FROM 
THE WEAK LOW PRESSURE NEAR THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE INTO THE CENTRAL 
GULF OF MEXICO. A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS POSITIONED 
ACROSS THE FLORIDA STRAITS SOUTH OF THE ISLANDS. NUMEROUS SHOWERS 
AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS IMPACTED THE ISLANDS AND MUCH OF THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS DURING THE MORNING HOURS.

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...SATELLITE ANALYSIS...RADAR TRENDS...AND 
OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT THE KEYS ARE UNDER A MESO-HIGH PRESSURE 
AREA. ACTIVITY OVER THE AREA HAS WANED AS THE ATMOSPHERE HAS LIKELY 
BEEN WORKED OVER...BUT KEY WEST RADAR IS NOW DEPICTING THE LEADING 
EDGE OF A LARGE AREA OF NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS 
ADVANCING SLOWLY TOWARDS DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. TEMPERATURES 
HAVE RISEN BACK INTO THE MIDDLE 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 
70S. WINDS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF RANGE FROM SOUTH TO WEST BETWEEN 4 
AND 11 KNOTS. 
 
.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(500-200 MB)...UPPER LOW 
PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN BAHAMAS WILL CONTINUE MOVING WESTWARD 
TOWARDS THE KEYS...AS A NARROW TROUGH SLOWLY RETREATS NORTHWARD OVER 
THE GULF OF MEXICO. ALL OF THIS WILL KEEP VERY HIGH MOISTURE...WITH 
PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) NEAR 2.00 INCHES OVER THE KEYS. IN 
ADDITION...ELEVATED 200 MB DIVERGENCE WILL AID IN PRODUCING A GOOD 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 
TUESDAY. SOME OF THESE STORMS WILL CONTAIN ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OVER 
30 KNOTS. COOL 500 MB TEMPERATURES SHOULD CONTINUE TO SUPPORT LOTS 
OF LIGHTNING WITH THESE STORMS. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...590 DM 500 MB HEIGHTS IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH A BUILDING CARIBBEAN ANTICYCLONE WILL BUILD BACK BACK OVER THE 
KEYS. 
 
IN THE LOW AND MID-LEVELS (SURFACE TO 500 MB)...TONIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT...THE 12Z UKMET AND GFS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH THE 
TIMING OF THE MOVEMENT OF THE RIDGE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS TONIGHT. LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS WILL BACK TO EAST BY 
TOMORROW MORNING. ON SUNDAY...LIGHT TO GENTLE EAST WINDS AT THE 
SURFACE WILL BACK TO NORTHEAST OVER THE ISLANDS ON SUNDAY AND LABOR 
DAY...ALLOWING FOR IDEAL MESOSCALE CONDITIONS FOR CLOUD LINES AND 
MAINLAND STORMS AND/OR BOUNDARIES TO IMPACT THE KEYS. IN 
ADDITION...THE AFOREMENTIONED SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT AND UPPER 
DIVERGENCE WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL AID IN GENERATION OF HEAVY 
SHOWERS AND STORMS.  THE LATEST 12 MAV...NAM...AND FWC 12 HOUR POP 
GUIDANCE #S ARE BETWEEN 40 AND 70 PERCENT FOR THIS PERIOD. WILL KEEP 
POP #S IN THE GOOD CHANCE CATEGORY WHICH IS WHAT WE HAVE GOING. WILL 
LOWER OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE UPPER 70S...AS THE AIR 
TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY CLOSE IN ON THE DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES 
UNDERNEATH THE HEAVIEST SHOWERS AND STORMS...BUT OF COURSE ITS 
DIFFICULT TO TIME WHEN THIS WILL HAPPEN.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE SHOULD 
REMAIN NORTH OF THE KEYS ACROSS FLORIDA. SOME DRYING IN THE 
MID-LEVELS IS INDICATED WITH THE MODELS FORECASTED HEIGHT RISES. 12 
HOUR POPS FOR THE EXTENDED HAVE FALLEN BACK TO NEAR 30 PERCENT. 
HOWEVER...AT THE MOMENT...I AM STILL CARRYING MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
CHANCE POPS...AND ITS POSSIBLE THAT A WEAK WAVE NOW NEAR THE 
WINDWARD ISLANDS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS LATER IN THE WEEK. 
&&

.MARINE...BOATERS WILL ENCOUNTER SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ACROSS KEYS WATERS THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY. THE BIGGEST HAZARDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THESE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FREQUENT YET DEADLY 
CLOUD TO WATER LIGHTNING STRIKES...AND LOCALLY SEAS/BAY WATERS 
ASSOCIATED WITH ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OVER 30 KNOTS. OUTSIDE OF 
SHOWERS AND STORMS...LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS THIS EVENING WILL BACK 
TO BETWEEN SOUTHEAST AND EAST BY LATE TONIGHT. WINDS SHOULD BE FROM 
THE EAST NEAR 10 KNOTS OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION FOR TOMORROW THROUGH 
TUESDAY.

330 PM EDT FRI SEP 1 2006

.DISCUSSION....DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 
MB) THE MAIN AXIS OF AN UNSEASONABLY DEEP AND SHARP FULL LATITUDINAL 
TROUGH IS CENTERED FROM CHICAGO SOUTHWARD TO THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF 
OF MEXICO. THE CENTER OF A WARM CORE ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE IS 
POSITIONED 200 MILES EAST OF CAPE HATTERAS. SOUTHEAST OF THAT...A 
TROPICAL UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH AXIS IS CENTERED OVER HISPANIOLA 
AND MOVING WEST. THE FLORIDA KEY LIE BETWEEN THE COLD CORE TROUGH 
AND THE TROPICAL TROUGH...BENEATH DIFFLUENCE AT 200 MB.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...AS OF 200 PM...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
IS POSITIONED FROM THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS WESTWARD TO ACROSS THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS BETWEEN CUBA AND THE KEYS. TO THE NORTH OF 
US...TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO...NOW LOCATED OVER INLAND EASTERN 
VIRGINIA...IS MOVING NORTH NEAR 15 MPH. A WEAK TRAILING TROUGH IS 
POSITIONED FROM THIS SYSTEM SOUTHWARDS TO OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. A 
SECOND TROUGH AT 850 MB IS LOCATED OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO.

.CURRENTLY...AT 200 PM...TEMPERATURE WAS 88 DEGREES AT KEY WEST 
INTERNATIONAL...BUT 83 DEGREES AT THE KEY WEST WEATHER SERVICE 
OFFICE. WINDS OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION ARE SOUTHWEST NEAR 10 KNOTS 
ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY. KEY WEST RADAR 
IS DEPICTING ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER KEY WEST...EXTENDING 
EASTWARD TO JUST NORTH OF BOCA CHICA...AND INTO SUGARLOAF AND CUDJOE 
KEY. SO FAR TODAY...THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS HAVE DELIVERED UP TO A 
QUICK HALF INCH OF RAINFALL OVER PORTIONS OF THE LOWER KEYS. 
 
.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500 TO 200 MB)...TONIGHT THROUGH THE 
MONDAY...THE FULL LATITUDINAL TROUGH WILL REMAIN LOCATED FROM THE 
GREAT LAKES TO THE DIXIE STATES THROUGH THE WEEKEND. A TROPICAL 
UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH AXIS OVER HISPANIOLA WILL SLIDE WESTWARD 
REACHING THE NORTHWEST BAHAMAS OR FLORIDA SUNDAY AND MONDAY. THE 
FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE SANDWICHED BETWEEN THESE TWO CYCLONIC SYSTEMS. 
WILL SEE SLIGHTLY COOLER 500 MB HEIGHTS AND AMPLE 200 MB DIFFLUENCE 
OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS. THIS WILL PROVIDE ADDITIONAL SYNOPTIC SCALE 
SUPPORT FOR SCATTERED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY THROUGH THE 
PERIOD.

EXTENDED...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...12Z MODEL RUNS HINT THAT ANOTHER 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH NOW IN THE CANADIAN PRAIRIE PROVINCES WILL DIVE 
SOUTHEAST INTO THE UPPER PLAINS ON MONDAY...REINVIGORATING THE 
LARGE SCALE FULL LATITUDINAL TROUGH OVER THE EAST CENTRAL CONUS FOR 
THE REST OF THE WEEK.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)IN THE NEAR 
TERM(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW) TROPICAL DEPRESSION ERNESTO...NOW LOCATED 
INLAND OVER EASTERN VIRGINIA WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHWARD INTO 
THE NORTHEAST STATES...TRAILING A RATHER ACTIVE TROUGH ACROSS THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC FARTHER EASTWARD INTO THE BAHAMAS. THE LOW LEVEL 
TROUGH NOW OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL SLIDE EASTWARD TO 
OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA.

THE LATEST (12Z) MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS AND MAV MOS GUIDANCE ARE A 
LITTLE SLOWER IN MOVING THE RIDGE NOW SOUTH OF THE KEYS NORTHWARD 
OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS THROUGH TOMORROW...AND THEY REALLY DO NOT 
MOVE THE RIDGE OVER THE KEYS UNTIL TOMORROW NIGHT. THE 12Z NAM 
MAINTAINS THE RIDGE SOUTH OF THE KEYS THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY. AS A 
RESULT...A SURFACE TO 20 KFT MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL ALLOW FOR 
CONTINUED CUMULUS LINE EPISODES NEAR THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN FOR THIS 
EVENING AND SATURDAY. THE PRESENT COVERAGE OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
STORMS WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS WILL SLIDE NORTHEAST THIS EVENING. NOT 
CONVINCED THAT THE CUBAN STUFF HAS HIGH ENOUGH MAGNITUDE OF 0 TO 6 
KM STORM MOTION THAT WOULD ALLOW IT TO REACH THE KEYS CUMULUS LINE 
THIS EVENING. WITH THE THE UPPER SUPPORT/LIFT AM INCLINED TO POST 
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS FOR TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...12Z GFS CONTINUES TO INDICATE 
THAT THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS...AS AN 
UPPER LOW APPROACHES THE KEYS FROM THE EAST. GIVEN THIS SCENARIO CAN 
EXPECT A LIGHT TO GENTLE EAST FLOW TO ALLOW FOR A PRODUCTIVE CUMULUS 
LINE ENVIRONMENT SUNDAY...WITH HEAT TROUGHING ON THE MAINLAND 
BACKING THE LOW LEVEL WINDS TO NORTHEAST. THIS WOULD ALSO ALLOW FOR 
ACTIVITY TO MOVE DOWN FROM THE MAINLAND AS WELL. ALL OF THIS 
SUPPORTS AT LEAST MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS SATURDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT MOS #S FOR THE GFS ON SUNDAY ARE IN THE 
GOOD CHANCE TO LOW LIKELY CATEGORY. IF THE UPPER LOW DOES NOT 
INTERFERE WITH THE  MESOSCALE...THIS SEEMS REASONABLE ATTM.   

INDICATIONS FOR A WETTER THAN NORMAL PATTERN CONTINUING FOR MONDAY 
AND MONDAY NIGHT...WITH A WAVE MOVING NOW OVER THE ATLANTIC EXPECTED 
TO MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. 12 HOUR POPS FOR 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT ARE NEAR 50 PERCENT WHICH IS JUST 10 PERCENT 
ABOVE WHAT WE HAVE...SO AM RELUCTANT TO ALTER POPS.  

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...IN THE EXTENDED...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE IS PROGGED TO POKE BACK TO THE WEST...BUT REMAIN NORTH OF THE 
KEYS. 12 HOUR POP #S RETURN TO NEAR CLIMO FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY...BUT WILL HOLD WITH INHERITED MIDDLE OF THE ROAD POPS UNTIL 
WE GET CLOSER. 

&&

.MARINE...SOUTHWEST WINDS NEAR 10 KNOTS WILL BECOME VARIABLE 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...AND BECOME EAST ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WINDS AND 
SEAS WILL BE HIGHER IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. EXPECT CLOUDLINES 
FORMING NEAR THE KEYS DURING THE DAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...WITH 
HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE WITHIN THESE CLOUDLINES. IN 
ADDITION...MARINERS WILL HAVE TO BE ON THE LOOKOUT FOR WATERSPOUTS 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. MARINERS SHOULD STAY TUNED FOR THE LATEST 
MARINE WARNINGS OR STATEMENTS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE 
OFFICE IN KEY WEST.

&&

.AVIATION...FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...WIDELY 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALONG WITH ISOLATED SURFACE WIND GUSTS OF 
AROUND 25 KNOTS WILL GENERATE MVF/IFR CONDITIONS THROUGH THIS 
EVENING...OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL. FOR THE KEY WEST

OFFSHORE OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST...A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE IS 
EXTENDING ACROSS CENTRAL CUBA.  

SYNOPTIC OVERVIEW...
A DEEP LAYERED (1000-500 MB) WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE EXTENDING ACROSS 
CUBA TONIGHT...WILL GRADUALLY LIFT NORTHWARD OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND

GIVEN CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE (PWAT AROUND 2 INCHES) IN PLACE...A 
UNIDIRECTIONAL SOUTHWEST FLOW AND INCREASING INSOLATION MAY ALLOW 
CLOUD LINES TO PERSIST INTO THIS EVENING. LATER ON TONIGHT...A LOSS 
OF INSOLATION AND A SOUTHWEST FLOW SHOULD KEEP CUBAN ACTIVITY AND 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES OVER THE STRAITS. HENCE...WILL DROP POPS INTO THE 
30 PERCENT RANGE. FOR FRIDAY...BOTH GFS/NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS 
REVEAL A VERY MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITHIN A 
FAVORABLE LIGHT SOUTHWEST FLOW. SUBSEQUENTLY...MESOSCALE FORCING 
WITH CLOUD LINES APPEAR TO BE THE MAIN CONCERN. IN ADDITION...TO

POSSIBILITY. 

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
DESPITE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING PWAT VALUES OF AROUND 2 
INCHES...THE DEEP LAYERED ANTICYCLONE LYING OVERHEAD SHOULD LIMIT 
CONVECTIVE VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE...WILL RETURN POPS TO 
CLIMO FOR THIS PERIOD.

BOUNDARIES COMBINED WITH INSOLATION INDUCED CLOUD LINES SHOULD 
PROVIDE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE BALANCE OF

APPROPRIATE...SO NO CHANGES ARE EXPECTED IN THE PUBLIC ZONE 
FORECAST.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
330 AM EDT THU AUG 31 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A DEEP SOUTHWEST WIND FLOW REMAINS ESTABLISHED OVER THE 
KEYS...BETWEEN ERNESTOS LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TO OUR NORTH AND 
A DEEP LAYERED RIDGE SETTING UP ACROSS THE BAHAMAS TO CUBA. WIND 
SPEEDS ARE NEAR 15 KT OVER UPPER KEYS WATERS...AND PROBABLY OVER BAY 
AND GULF WATERS OF THE KEYS AS WELL...WHILE A COUPLE OF SHIP REPORTS 
OUT IN THE STRAITS REPORTED 10 KT WINDS. THE PLATFORM 50 MILES NNW 
OF KEY WEST REPORTS SW WINDS 12 KT. NUMEROUS NARROW CLOUD LINES ARE 
SEEN ON RADAR OVER THE KEYS REGION ALIGNED SW-TO-NE WITH THE FLOW 
WRAPPING UP INTO ERNESTO...NOW CENTERED OFF NE FLORIDA. A FEW 
SHOWERS AND EVEN AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM HAVE POPPED UP NEAR THE 
MID AND UPPER KEYS WITHIN SOME OF THESE CLOUD LINES. WHILE THE LOCAL 
ATMOSPHERE REMAINS VERY MOIST...GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS AN AREA 
OF DRIER AIR ALOFT UPSTREAM TO OUR SOUTHWEST (OVER THE EXTREME SE 
GULF OF MEXICO). 

.FORECAST...
AT LEAST MODELS DONT SHOW ANY TROPICAL SYSTEM DEVELOP NEAR THE KEYS 
THROUGH THE COMING WEEK. 

IN THE NEAR TERM A DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN INTACT 
OVER THE KEYS REGION...THEN GO LIGHT AND VARIABLE AT THE SURFACE 
SOMETIME LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY AS THE SURFACE RIDGE 
SHIFTS NORTH OVER THE AREA. A RETURN TO A GENERAL EASTERLY FLOW IS 
SHOWN BY MODELS TO SET IN BY LATE SATURDAY AND CONTINUE ON INTO THE 
COMING WEEK.

TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...I WONT BUY INTO THE NAM MODEL WHICH BRINGS 
VERY DRY AIR INTO THE KEYS REGION AT UPPER LEVELS (AT 700 MB AND UP 
TO 500 MB) DURING TODAY AND KEEPS IT OVERHEAD AT LEAST INTO SUNDAY. 
THE GFS IS MORE ACCEPTABLE IN ITS DRYING ALOFT WHICH AS RH VALUES 
DIPPING INTO THE 60-70 PERCENT RANGE AT 700 MB AND EVEN DOWN TO 
BELOW 850 MB LEVELS TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS STILL WOULD MAINTAIN
SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FOR SHOWERS IF THERE IS SOME FOCUS FOR 
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT. THAT WOULD SEEM TO BE THE ALREADY-EXISTING CLOUD 
LINES TRAILING WELL SOUTHWEST FROM ERNESTO TO THE KEYS FOR TODAY...
AND PERHAPS SOME TCU AND CB BUILD-UPS THIS AFTERNOON AND AGAIN 
FRIDAY DUE TO THE SW FLOW WHICH PARALLELS THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN. 
GFS MODEL GIVES 40 PCT POPS FOR TODAY AND FRIDAY...AND 30 PCT POPS 
FOR TONIGHT WHICH IN FACT MAY BE APPROPRIATE GIVEN THE SLIGHT DRYING 
ALOFT. I WILL MAINTAIN 40 PCT POPS WHICH ARE IN THE ONGOING 
FORECAST. ONE CONCERN FOR EARLY TODAY IS THAT WIND SPEEDS MIGHT JUMP 
UP SOME THIS MORNING...DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH ERNESTO DEEPENS WHILE 
MOVING FARTHER AWAY FROM THIS AREA. 

FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...DEEP MOISTURE IS SHOWN BY THE GFS MODEL 
TO BE IN PLACE OVER THE KEYS (SURFACE UP TO 700 MB) WITH A LIGHT 
SOUTHERLY FLOW THAT GRADUALLY TURNS TO E OR ESE BY LATE SATURDAY...
AS THE SURFACE AND MID LEVEL RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS NORTH OVER THE KEYS.
40 PCT POPS ARE GIVEN BY GFS MOS...AND I WILL STICK TO THAT. THE 
LIGHT WIND FLOW MAY ALLOW SATURDAY AFTERNOON SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE KEYS ISLANDS. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A DEEP EASTERLY FLOW SHOULD SET 
UP (SURFACE TO 10 THSD FT) WITH TYPICAL MOISTURE IN PLACE. AT THE 
500 MB LEVEL...THE GFS MODEL DOES SHOW A WEAK LOW OR TROUGH FORMING  
NEAR THE KEYS SATURDAY NIGHT AND LINGERING THROUGH MONDAY OR TUESDAY.
IT SHOWS SLIGHT COOLING ALOFT DURING THIS TIME (MINUS 8C AT 500 MB)
AND SOME LIFT MONDAY. CURRENTLY FORECASTED 40 PCT 12-HOUR POPS ARE
ALSO GENERALLY SHOWN BY THE EXTENDED GFS FOR THIS PERIOD. 
&&

.MARINE...
SW WINDS MAY PICK UP CLOSE TO 15 KT FOR A WHILE EARLY TODAY...BUT
AS ERNESTOS CIRCULATION LIFTS FARTHER AWAY TO OUR NORTH WE SHOULD
SEE WIND SPEEDS COME DOWN CLOSER TO 10 KT BY DAYS END. LOOK FOR 10 
KT SW WINDS TO STICK AROUND ON THROUGH FRIDAY...PERHAPS SLACKING
OFF A BIT AS WINDS TURN CLOSER TO S FRIDAY NIGHT. AT THIS TIME...
IT APPEARS THAT A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE MAY MOVE OVER THE KEYS
DURING SATURDAY AND THAT COULD GIVE SOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS 
FOR A WHILE BEFORE THEY GO E TO SE NEAR 10 KT LATE IN THE DAY. 
A GENERAL WIND FLOW FROM THE EAST NEAR 10 KT SHOULD TAKE HOLD INTO 
SUNDAY AND LABOR DAY. WATCH FOR DAILY BUILDUPS OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS NEAR KEYS ISLANDS THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS...AND A FEW IFR VISIBILITIES IN 
STRONGER CELLS. COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE HIGHER 
ON THE MAINLAND THIS AFTERNOON...BUT CONFIDENCE TOO LOW AT THIS TIME 
TO INDICATE SUCH IN TWEB PRODUCT. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE 
SOUTHWEST TO WEST AT AROUND 10 KNOTS.

CURRENTLY...
GOES-12 VISIBLE SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHS AND LOCAL RADARS INDICATE 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION ERNESTO IS LOCATED OVER LAKE OKEECHOBEE...MOVING 
NORTH NEAR 10 MPH...WITH THE SOUTHERNMOST OUTER RAINBAND WEAKENING 
OVER THE OUTER WATERS OF MAINLAND MONROE AND THE WATERS NORTH OF THE 
ISLAND CHAIN. BECAUSE THE EASTERN PORTION OF OUR REGION IS STILL 
WITHIN THE TROPICAL CYCLONE CIRCULATION...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS 
INDICATE MOSTLY SOUTHWEST WINDS RANGING FROM NEAR 15 KNOTS ON THE 
WESTERN STRAITS...TO 25 KNOTS OVER THE EXTREME EASTERN STRAITS. 

SYNOPTIC OVERVIEW...
TROPICAL DEPRESSION ERNESTO WILL LIFT NORTH NORTHEASTWARD AND MERGE 
WITH A DEEP LAYERED MIDLATITUDE TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...BEFORE MOVING NORTHWARD INTO THE UPPER 
MIDWEST AND INTO EASTERN CANADA THIS WEEKEND. IN WAKE OF ERNESTO...A

INSTABILITY WILL PROMPT ABOVE NORMAL POPS. 

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
WITH OUR WIND FIELD TRANSITIONING FROM SOUTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST WITH 
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE GRADUALLY LIFTING INTO OUR 
AREA...CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE WILL ALLOW MESOSCALE INTERACTIONS IN 
THE FORM OF CLOUD LINES AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES. HENCE...SLIGHTLY 
ABOVE NORMAL POPS WILL BE KEPT THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
A DEEPENING AND STRENGTHENING NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW WILL MAINTAIN 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE POPS. 

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...
WITH THE (TUTT) MOVING THROUGH OUR AREA...WEAK LARGE SCALE LIFT 
COMBINED WITH PWAT VALUES OF AROUND 2 INCHES WILL PROMPT ABOVE CLIMO

.DISCUSSION...
ERNESTO MADE LANDFALL IN THE FLORIDA KEYS OVER PLANTATION KEY THIS 
PAST EVENING...AND EARLY THIS MORNING MADE A SECOND LANDFALL OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA. THIS IS THE FIRST TROPICAL CYCLONE WHOSE CENTER 
CROSSED DIRECTLY OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS SINCE HURRICANE IRENE IN 
1999. ERNESTO IS STILL A TROPICAL STORM...MOVING NORTHWARD OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA AT 8 MPH.

THE BANDING FEATURES ON ERNESTOS WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PERIPHERY AND 
HAD BEEN AFFECTING THE FLORIDA KEYS HAVE LARGELY SHIFTED NORTHWARD 
OF THE KEYS. MOST OF THE TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ARE LOCATED 
WITHIN THESE BANDS. SUSTAINED WINDS IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS 
HAVE BEEN RUNNING NEAR 30 KNOTS WITH GUSTS NEAR TROPICAL STORM 
FORCE. THE FURTHER WEST ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN...THE WEAKER THE 
WINDS ARE...SAND KEY HAS BEEN REPORTING 15 TO 20 KNOTS...BUT RADAR 
IS INDICATING WINDS NEAR TROPICAL STORM FORCE IN RAINBANDS. IN 
ADDITION...STORM TOTALS ACROSS THE KEYS WERE FOR THE MOST PART 
BETWEEN 3 AND 6 INCHES...BUT THE HEAVIER SWATHES OF RAIN HAVE 
SHIFTED NORTH AND THE THREAT FOR FLOODING HAS DIMINISHED. THE FLOOD 
WATCH HAS BEEN CANCELLED.

.FORECAST...
ERNESTO IS MOVING NORTHWARD AROUND THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A DEEP 
ANTICYCLONE OVER THE ATLANTIC. ERNESTO SHOULD ACCELERATE AND TURN 
MORE NORTHWARD AS IT ROUNDS THE RIDGE...AND FALLS UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF A TROUGH APPROACHING THE APPALACHIANS.

AS ERNESTO CONTINUES TO PULL FURTHER AWAY FROM THE KEYS...WINDS WILL 
WEAKEN AND BANDING FEATURES WILL AFFECT THE KEYS AREA LESS 
FREQUENTLY. UNTIL WINDS DECREASE FURTHER...A TROPICAL STORM WARNING 
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR ALL KEYS WATERS. HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY 
ARE EXPECTED TO GET INTO THE UPPER 80S. SHOWERS WILL REMAIN LIKELY 
TODAY...BUT WILL NOT BE AS FREQUENT. WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP TO 
AROUND 10 MPH. 

A LOWER TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE WILL BUILD WESTWARD AND SHIFT NORTHWARD 
BEHIND ERNESTO THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEK. BY SATURDAY THE 
RIDGE WILL BE LOCATED VERY NEAR THE KEYS. AS THE POOL OF DEEP 
MOISTURE AND HIGHER WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH ERNESTO LEAVES THE AREA 
POPS WILL STEADILY DECLINE. WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO THE 
CURRENT TREND IN THE LOCAL  FORECAST. 

THE ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT FURTHER NORTHWARD 
SUNDAY INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA...AND REMAIN THERE THROUGH THE FIRST 
HALF OF NEXT WEEK. NORMAL POPS...TEMPS...AND WINDS CAN BE EXPECTED 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD.

TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO IS LOCATED IN EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA...AND

.CURRENTLY...
LOCAL RADARS AND EARLY VISIBLE SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHS REVEAL A LARGE 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX LOCATED BETWEEN ANDROS ISLAND AND THE ISLAND OF 
CUBA...WITH NUMEROUS BROKEN BANDS OF SHOWERS TRAVERSING 
SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND THE ADJACENT NEARSHORE 
WATERS. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS TROPICAL STORM 
ERNESTO...LOCATED NORTH OF THE EAST CENTRAL COAST OF CUBA...ABOUT 
140 MILES SOUTHEAST OF KEY LARGO...WITH A WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE POKING ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. OTHERWISE...OUR MORNING 
SOUNDING REVEALS A STRENGTHENING...MOISTENING (PWAT 1.96 INCHES) AND

.FORECAST...
WITH TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO MIGRATING TOWARD THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 
KEYS...SHOWERS...SQUALLS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME 
WIDESPREAD OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN THIS AFTERNOON. AT THIS TIME...THE 
MAIN TROPICAL STORM HAZARDS WILL BE VERY HEAVY RAINFALL ALONG WITH 
TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS. IN ADDITION...A FEW TORNADOES ARE ALWAYS 
POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONGER OUTER RAINBANDS. SINCE THERE ARE NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE TRACK OR INTENSITY...A HURRICANE WATCH 
...TROPICAL STORM WARNING AND A FLOOD WATCH WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT 
FOR THE ENTIRE ISLAND CHAIN. SUBSEQUENTLY...WILL UPDATE THE PUBLIC

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
525 AM EDT TUE AUG 29 2006

.DISCUSSION...
TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO...NEAR THE NORTH COAST OF CENTRAL 
CUBA...CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHWESTWARD AT 14 MPH. DEEP CONVECTION IS 
LOCATED JUST NORTH OF THE CIRCULATION CENTER...WITH A LITTLE 
SOUTHERLY SHEAR. THE SHEAR IS BEING PRODUCED BY A SMALL UPPER LEVEL 
LOW OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS...CURRENTLY MOVING RAPIDLY WESTWARD. A 
TROPICAL STORM WARNING AND A HURRICANE WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR 
ALL KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. 

SYNOPTICALLY...A SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS DIGGING SOUTHEASTWARD OVER THE 
PLAINS. IN RESPONSE...AN UPPER LEVEL HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN 
STATES IS SHIFTING EASTWARD OFF OF THE ATLANTIC COAST. A LOWER 
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE NOSES OVER FLORIDA FROM THE ATLANTIC.

THE OUTER CIRCULATION OF ERNESTO IS BEGINNING TO WORK ITS WAY INTO 
KEYS WATERS. WINDS ACROSS THE ISLANDS HAVE BEEN MAINLY EAST AT 
AROUND 10 TO 15 MPH. A COUPLE OF LINES OF SHOWERS...WITH A FEW 
EMBEDDED  THUNDERSTORMS...DRAPED ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS ARE MOVING WEST SOUTHWEST AT AROUND 15 TO 20 KNOTS. 
TEMPERATURES HAVE FALLEN INTO THE MID 80S WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 
LOWER 70S.

.FORECAST...
THE LATEST FORECAST TRACK HAS ERNESTO MOVING NORTHWESTWARD AWAY FROM 
CUBA THIS MORNING. THE DEEP RIDGE NEAR FLORIDA WILL KEEP ERNESTO 
MOVING IN A NORTHWEST DIRECTION...HOWEVER OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
DAY...THE RIDGE WILL SHIFT EASTWARD...ALLOWING ERNESTO TO TAKE ON A 
MORE NORTH NORTHWESTERLY TRACK. THE LATEST FORECAST TRACK BRINGS 
ERNESTO ACROSS THE UPPER KEYS AND ASHORE SOUTH FLORIDA TONIGHT. 
ERNESTO IS EXPECTED TO REINTENSIFY DURING IS PASSAGE THROUGH THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS DUE TO BE CLEAR OF TOPOGRAPHY AND THE WARM SEA 
SURFACE TEMPERATURES. BUT DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT AND SLIGHT SHEAR 
PROVIDED BY THE SMALL UPPER LEVEL LOW LOCATED OVER THE KEYS SHOULD 
SLOW ERNESTOS ABILITY TO REORGANIZE.

THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE DAY...CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO WORSEN 
AS THE STORM NEARS THE ISLAND CHAIN...WITH TROPICAL STORM FORCE 
WINDS ANTICIPATED FOR THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS TODAY AND POSSIBLE 
HURRICANE FORCE GUSTS. THE GREATEST CHANCE FOR TROPICAL STORM FORCE 
WINDS OVER THE LOWER KEYS WILL COME THIS EVENING. EVEN THOUGH THIS 
IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE A STRONG HURRICANE...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IS 
EXPECTED...AND INLAND FLOODING MAY BE A POTENTIAL THREAT. STORM 
SURGES OF 1 TO 3 FEET IS EXPECTED. 

CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS ERNESTO 
DRAWS FURTHER NORTHWARD OVER FLORIDA...AND AWAY FROM THE KEYS. WINDS 
AND SEAS WILL RAPIDLY DECREASE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BY 
THURSDAY...AN ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE WILL SHIFT NORTHWARD...AND BE 
LOCATED OVER THE STRAITS...RETURNING MORE NORMAL SUMMER WEATHER TO 
THE KEYS.

KEEP ABREAST OF THE LATEST FORECAST AND LOCAL STATEMENTS FOR THE 
LATEST INFORMATION AND EXPECTED CONDITIONS FROM ERNESTO THROUGH 
TODAY AND EARLY WEDNESDAY.

&&

.MARINE...
ERNESTO IS EXPECTED TO CROSS THE FLORIDA STRAITS AS A SLOWLY 
INTENSIFYING TROPICAL STORM. TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS WILL SPREAD 
OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS TODAY. THE LATEST TRACK BRINGS ERNESTO 
THROUGH OUR EASTERN WATERS...AND IT IS THERE WERE THE STRONGEST 
WINDS AND HIGHEST SEAS ARE EXPECTED. ERNESTO WILL MAKE LANDFALL 
TONIGHT OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. STRONG WINDS AND HIGH SEAS WILL QUICKLY 
RELAX ONCE ERNESTO MOVES OUT OF OUR AREA. A TROPICAL STORM WARNING 
REMAINS IN EFFECT AND SMALL CRAFT SHOULD REMAIN IN PORT.

&&

.AVIATION...
FOR FLORIDA KEYS TERMINALS KEYW & KMTH AND ALSO FOR THE ROUTE 
KMIA-KEYW...THROUGH 20Z TUESDAY PREVAILING VFR CONDITIONS ARE 
EXPECTED HOWEVER ISOLATED MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS IN SHOWERS EARLY THIS 
MORNING WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE NUMEROUS 15Z-20Z AS SPIRAL 
RAINBANDS MOVE INTO THE AREA. AFTER 20Z PREVAILING MVFR CEILINGS AND 
VISIBILITIES IN RAIN WILL SPREAD OVER THE AREA WITH SCATTERED IFR 
CONDITIONS IN SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS. THE APPROACH OF TROPICAL STORM 
ERNESTO FROM THE SOUTHEAST WILL PRODUCE NE WINDS 12-15 KT GUSTING TO

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
335 PM EDT MON AUG 28 2006

.DISCUSSION...
TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO WILL BE THE PRIMARY FEATURE GOVERNING LOCAL 
WEATHER OVER THE NEXT 72 HOURS. CURRENTLY...TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO 
IS IN A WEAKENED STATE OVER THE LAS TUNA PROVINCE OF EASTERN CUBA... 
MOVING TOWARD THE NORTHWEST AT 9KT. GOES-12 VISIBLE CHANNEL IMAGERY 
SHOWS A DISORGANIZED TROPICAL CYCLONE WITH A DETACHED MESOSCALE 
CONVECTIVE SYSTEM WELL SOUTHEAST OF THE CENTER...OVER THE WINDWARD 
PASSAGE. MEANWHILE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY HAS INCREASED NORTH OF THE 
CENTER OVER PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN BAHAMAS. THIS 
CONVECTION MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH ENHANCED ASCENT FROM A WEAK 
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE EVIDENT IN MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGERY JUST 
SOUTHEAST OF ANDROS ISLAND. SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW NUMEROUS OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES MOVING WEST AND SOUTHWEST OVER THE WATERS ADJACENT TO THE 
CENTRAL BAHAMAS AND NORTH OF CUBA. THE PRESENCE OF OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES SO CLOSE TO THE CYCLONE CENTER CONFIRMS A WEAK 
CIRCULATION. AN AIR FORCE RESERVE RECONNAISSANCE AIRCRAFT IS 
CURRENTLY INVESTIGATING TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO AND SHOULD PROVIDE 
VALUABLE DIAGNOSTIC DATA FOR PREPARATION OF THE 5PM ADVISORY.

A DEEP LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED 
STATES IS PROVIDING DEEP EASTERLY FLOW OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
SURROUNDING WATERS. AT THE SURFACE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE REMAINS NORTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS WITH AN AXIS RUNNING 
ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA AND ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THE 
RIDGE HAS MOVED A LITTLE NORTH DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS...AND 
24-HOUR MSL PRESSURE FALLS OF 1-2MB HAVE BEEN MEASURED AT KEY WEST 
AND MARATHON.

THE 18Z KEY WEST SPECIAL SOUNDING REVEALED A SUPPRESSED CONVECTIVE 
ENVIRONMENT...WITH WARM TEMPERATURES ALOFT...10.4C AT 700MB AND 
-4.1C AT 500MB...AND DRY AIR SEEPING DOWN BELOW 700MB. THE 700MB AND 
850MB DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS WERE 14C AND 7C...RESPECTIVELY. THE 
RESULTING WEAK LAPSE RATES AND LOW-LEVEL CONVECTIVE INHIBITION AND 
DRY AIR HAVE KEPT LOCAL CONVECTION SHALLOW AND ISOLATED. 

DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS...TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO IS LIKELY TO 
MOVE NORTHWEST AND EMERGE OFF THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA SOUTH OF 
ANDROS ISLAND OVER THE GREAT BAHAMA BANK. THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE 
STEERED NORTHWESTWARD TOWARD A WEAKNESS IN A MID-LEVEL RIDGE OVER 
THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC AND FLORIDA PENINSULA. BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON...A MORE NORTHWARD MOTION IS LIKELY DUE TO HEIGHT FALLS 
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES ASSOCIATED WITH A DIGGING MIDLATITUDE 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH. THIS TYPE OF PATTERN WOULD BRING ERNESTO ACROSS 
THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA VERY NEAR THE UPPER KEYS...AND THEN NORTHWARD 
OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH 
RESPECT TO THE TRACK FORECAST AND EVEN MORE UNCERTAINTY EXISTS 
REGARDING THE INTENSITY FORECAST...AS FAVORABLE AND UNFAVORABLE 
FACTORS WILL COEXIST FOR INTENSIFICATION:  WARM SSTS...LIMITED 
INSTABILITY...LOW SHEAR...DRY ENVIRONMENTAL AIR BELOW 500MB. WHAT 
DOES SEEM CERTAIN IS A PERIOD OF CLOUDY...WET...AND WINDY WEATHER 
ACROSS MOST OF THE KEYS SOMETIME TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY. THEREAFTER... 
WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD DROP QUICKLY BY THURSDAY WITH A MORE 
CLIMATOLOGICAL REGIME SETTING UP FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK.
&&

.MARINE...
EAST WINDS AVERAGING 10-15KT HAVE PREVAILED AT MARINE PLATFORMS ALL 
DAY...AND WE EXPECT THE MODERATE EAST BREEZES TO PERSIST THIS 
EVENING. OVERNIGHT...WINDS WILL START TO BACK...BECOMING NORTHEAST 
TO EAST LATE...WITH SOME FRESHENING BREEZES OVER EASTERN SECTIONS OF 
THE SERVICE AREA. TUESDAY WILL BE A DAY OF TRANSITION WITH FRESH 
NORTHEAST BREEZES IN THE MORNING BECOMING STRONG DURING THE DAY. 
TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE KEYS... 
PARTICULARLY THE UPPER KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS WITH A VERY SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF HURRICANE CONDITIONS. BY WEDNESDAY MORNING...ERNESTO 
SHOULD BE NORTH OF THE AREA...AND CONDITIONS SHOULD RAPIDLY IMPROVE 
DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. SEAS WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO SUBSIDE.
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...VFR CONDITIONS WILL 
PREDOMINATE WITH ISOLATED MVFR/IFR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS 
EVENING...GIVING WAY TO SCATTERED COVERAGE BY MORNING. NORTHEAST TO

...HURRICANE WATCH IN EFFECT FOR ALL FLORIDA KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS...

.DISCUSSION...
TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO...LOCATED JUST SOUTH OF THE EASTERN END OF 
CUBA...WILL BE THE DOMINANT FACTOR IN KEYS WEATHER FOR THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS. CUBA IS EXPECTED TO NEGATIVELY AFFECT ERNESTO. THE 
AMOUNT OF DEGRADATION WILL DEPEND BOTH ON ERNESTOS EXACT TRACK AND 
DURATION OVER LAND. ERNESTO IS THEN EXPECTED TO MOVE OFF OF CUBA 
INTO THE FLORIDA STRAITS TUESDAY MORNING AND RESTRENGTHEN. THE 
CURRENT FORECAST TRACK BRINGS ERNESTO OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS TUESDAY 
NIGHT...AND THEN INTO SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. 

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE KEYS WILL MOST LIKELY OCCUR 
BEGINNING TUESDAY AND DIMINISHING ON WEDNESDAY. THERE IS A VERY 
LARGE DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE FORECAST IN TERMS OF 
TRACK...INTENSITY...AND TIMING...SO BE SURE TO CHECK FORECASTS AND 
DISCUSSIONS REGULARLY FOR UPDATES.

CURRENTLY ACROSS THE KEYS...A WEAK PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE 
ATLANTIC ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. OBSERVATIONS FROM ALONG 
THE REEF INDICATE MAINLY EAST WINDS NEAR 10 KNOTS...WHILE ISLAND 
LOCATIONS ARE REPORTING 5 TO 10 MPH. A SWATH OF DRIER AIR LIES 
ACROSS THE KEYS...WITH THE LATEST GPS SENSORS INDICATING AROUND 1.6 
INCHES. A FEW STABLE DRIER LAYERS ARE PROVIDING SUFFICIENT 
INHIBITION TO KEEP SHOWER AND STORM ACTIVITY TO ISOLATED. THIS 
EASTERLY FLOW IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN THROUGH TODAY...AND BACK TO MORE 
NORTHEASTERLY TONIGHT. WINDS WILL ALSO BEGIN INCREASING LATE TONIGHT 
DUE TO THE APPROACH OF ERNESTO...AS WILL RAIN CHANCES.

ON TUESDAY...CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO RAPIDLY DETERIORATE AS 
ERNESTO DRAWS NEARER TO THE KEYS. TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS ARE 
EXPECTED BEGINNING TUESDAY WITH A CHANCE FOR HURRICANE CONDITIONS. 
ERNESTO IS NOT A FAST MOVING SYSTEM. TROPICAL STORM CONDITIONS ARE 
EXPECTED TO LAST INTO WEDNESDAY.

CHECK HURRICANE LOCAL STATEMENTS ISSUED BY THIS OFFICE FOR DETAILS 
REGARDING STORM INFORMATION...PRECAUTIONARY/PREPAREDNESS 
ACTIONS...AND OTHER DETAILS.

&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE EAST BREEZES WILL PREVAIL TODAY. BASED ON LATEST ERNESTO 
FORECAST TRACK AND INTENSITY...BREEZES WILL FRESHEN SIGNIFICANTLY 
BEGINNING MONDAY NIGHT...WITH TROPICAL STORM-FORCE WINDS MOVING INTO 
THE ATLANTIC ZONES MONDAY NIGHT...AND KEYS...FLORIDA BAY...AND GULF 
WATERS DURING THE DAY TUESDAY...ENDING WEDNESDAY. THE HURRICANE 
CONDITIONS WILL BE MOST PROBABLE ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. 

MARINERS ARE ENCOURAGED TO USE THE GOOD WEATHER TODAY TO MAKE 
NECESSARY PREPARATIONS FOR ERNESTO. CONSULT THE HURRICANE LOCAL 
STATEMENT FROM THIS OFFICE...AS WELL AS ADVISORIES FROM THE NATIONAL 
HURRICANE CENTER FOR ADDITIONAL INFORMATION.

&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
THIS MORNING. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF 
LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS...WITH IFR VISIBILITIES POSSIBLE IN STRONGER 
CELLS. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE NORTHEAST TO EAST AT 8 KT OR 
LESS EARLY THIS MORNING...BECOMING MAINLY EAST AT 8 TO 10 KT.

...HURRICANE WATCH IN EFFECT FOR ALL FLORIDA KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS...

.DISCUSSION...
OVERALL...ONLY MINOR CHANGES WILL BE NECESSARY TO THE SHORT TERM 
PORTION OF THE FORECAST WHICH WAS ISSUED LATE THIS AFTERNOON. 
ERNESTO STILL REMAINS A TROPICAL STORM...AND THE LATEST ADVISORY HAS 
ITS WINDS DOWN TO 50 MPH. BUT SOME STRENGTHENING IS EXPECTED AS IT 
MOVES AWAY FROM THE HAITIAN COAST TONIGHT.

CLOSER TO THE KEYS...LATE EVENING WATER VAPOR IMAGES SHOW A 
RELATIVELY DRIER POCKET OF AIR ACROSS THE THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS. THIS IS REFLECTED IN OUR LOCAL SOUNDING WITH ONLY 1.66 
INCHES PWAT...AND LESS INSTABILITY. INDEED...AVAILABLE RADAR IMAGES 
FROM MIAMI (KEY WEST WSR 88-D IS INOPERATIONAL AND A REPAIR PART IS 
SCHEDULED TO ARRIVE DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY) SHOW ONLY ISOLATED 
SHOWERS NEAR OR IN THE EXTREME EASTERN PORTION OF THE SERVICE AREA. 
I MADE AN UPDATE TO THE SHORT TERM POP GRIDS TO TAKE THEM DOWN TO A 
SLIGHT CHANCE. A CORRESPONDING ZONE UPDATE WILL BE ISSUED SHORTLY. 
NO OTHER CHANGES ARE ANTICIPATED ON THE LATE EVENING MARINE UPDATE 
EITHER.


=======================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
WEATHER IN THE FLORIDA KEYS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL BE 
GOVERNED IN LARGE PART BY THE EVOLUTION OF TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO. 
ERNESTO HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM AS OF 500 PM EDT. 
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WAS WEAKENED BY INTERACTIONS WITH THE HIGH 
TERRAIN OF HAITI. HOWEVER...THE FORECAST TRACK HAS CHANGED LITTLE 
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND ERNESTO IS EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN 
AGAIN TO A HURRICANE AGAIN BEFORE MOVING ACROSS CUBA. THE SYSTEM IS 
THEN EXPECTED TO EMERGE OFF THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA OVER THE STRAITS 
OF FLORIDA...STRENGTHENING TO A HURRICANE AGAIN.

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE KEYS IN TERMS OF RAIN AND WIND 
WILL MOST LIKELY OCCUR ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THERE IS A VERY 
LARGE DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE FORECAST IN TERMS OF 
TRACK...INTENSITY...AND TIMING...SO BE SURE TO CHECK FORECASTS AND 
DISCUSSIONS REGULARLY FOR UPDATES.

...HURRICANE WATCH NOW IN EFFECT FOR ALL FLORIDA KEYS AND 
SURROUNDING WATERS...

.DISCUSSION...
WEATHER IN THE FLORIDA KEYS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL BE 
GOVERNED IN LARGE PART BY THE EVOLUTION OF TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO. 
ERNESTO HAS BEEN DOWNGRADED TO A TROPICAL STORM AS OF 500 PM EDT. 
THE TROPICAL CYCLONE WAS WEAKENED BY INTERACTIONS WITH THE HIGH 
TERRAIN OF HAITI. HOWEVER...THE FORECAST TRACK HAS CHANGED LITTLE 
FROM THE PREVIOUS ADVISORY...AND ERNESTO IS EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN 
AGAIN TO A HURRICANE AGAIN BEFORE MOVING ACROSS CUBA. THE SYSTEM IS 
THEN EXPECTED TO EMERGE OFF THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA OVER THE STRAITS 
OF FLORIDA...STRENGTHENING TO A HURRICANE AGAIN. 

THE MOST SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IN THE KEYS IN TERMS OF RAIN AND WIND 
WILL MOST LIKELY OCCUR ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THERE IS A VERY 
LARGE DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE FORECAST IN TERMS OF 
TRACK...INTENSITY...AND TIMING...SO BE SURE TO CHECK FORECASTS AND 
DISCUSSIONS REGULARLY FOR UPDATES.

********************************************************************
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
OUTFLOW FROM EARLIER MAINLAND CONVECTION...PUSHING INTO A BOUNDARY 
RICH ENVIRONMENT AROUND THE KEYS AND COASTAL WATERS...INITIATED AN 
ERUPTION OF HEAVY THUNDERSTORMS FROM AROUND 3Z TO 5Z...MAINLY NORTH 
OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS. THE STORMS NECESSITATED SEVERAL 
SPECIAL MARINE WARNINGS AS RADAR VELOCITY SIGNATURES IN SOME OF THE 
DOWNBURSTS EXCEEDED 40 KNOTS. AS THE OUTFLOW PUSHED THROUGH THE 
LOWER KEYS BOTH KEY WEST AND SAND KEY RECORDED GUSTS OF 27 KNOTS. 
CURRENTLY MOST OF THE CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED WITH SOME STRATIFORM 
RAIN EVIDENT WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS AND A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
ALONG AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS BETWEEN THE KEYS 
AND CUBA. A NORTH TO SOUTH ORIENTED OUTFLOW BOUNDARY...THE EASTERN 
AND NORTHERN EXTENT OF THE MAIN OUTFLOW FROM THE EARLIER 
CONVECTION...IS PUSHING THROUGH THE MIDDLE KEYS. HOWEVER...NO STORMS 
HAVE DEVELOPED ALONG THIS BOUNDARY. OUTSIDE OF STORM CONTAMINATION 
THE AMBIENT SURFACE WINDFIELD IS MAINLY EAST AT NEAR 5 KNOTS.
 
.FORECAST...
TODAY...SURFACE WINDS WILL BE MAINLY NORTHEAST TO EAST NEAR 10 KNOTS 
AS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WEAKENS AND MOVES NORTHWARD OVER CENTRAL 
FLORIDA. GFS MODEL SOUNDINGS HAVE PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES STILL 
ABOVE TWO INCHES...WITH 1000 TO 500MB RELATIVE HUMIDITIES OVER 70 
PERCENT. WINDS ALOFT WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AS THE CARIBBEAN UPPER 
LOW MOVES TOWARDS THE YUCATAN AND THE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
HOLDS. CURRENT FORECAST HAS MIDDLE CHANCE...AND WITH ABOVE SEE NO 
REASON TO CHANGE.

SUNDAY AND MONDAY...GFS SHOWS LOWER TROPOSPHERIC MOISTURE DROPPING

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AT THE SURFACE A WEAK ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS 
INTO FLORIDA. SURFACE WINDS ACROSS KEYS LOCATIONS ARE REPORTING 
NORTHEAST FLOW AT 10 TO 15 MPH. ALOFT...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE 
WESTERN CARIBBEAN IS TRACKING WESTWARD OVER THE YUCATAN. THIS UPPER 
LEVEL LOW IS LOCATED SOUTH OF A BROAD MID AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER 
THE SOUTHER STATES. THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED A LIGHT 
NORTHEASTERLY FLOW IN A TYPICAL CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE 
ENVIRONMENT...WITH LITTLE TO NO CAP. CURRENT RADAR IMAGERY INDICATED 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY OVER THE STRAITS. OF 
EVERYONES CONCERN IS TROPICAL STORM ERNESTO LOCATED OVER THE EASTERN 
CARIBBEAN SOUTH OF HISPANIOLA AND IS MOVING WEST NORTHWESTWARD AT 
AROUND 15 KNOTS.

&&

.FORECAST...
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL SHIFT 
WESTWARD INTO THE SOUTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO...THEN NORTHWESTWARD.  
THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE TO ITS NORTH WILL SHIFT EASTWARD AND THEN 
SOUTHEASTWARD. THE LOWER TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE WILL REMAIN NEARLY 
STATIONARY. THIS MEANS A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER THE 
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO.

ERNESTO IS BEING STEERED WEST NORTHWESTWARD BY THE ATLANTIC RIDGE. 
INITIALLY THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE WESTERN CARRIBEAN WAS 
PRODUCING SHEAR OVER ERNESTO. THIS SHEAR WAS PREVENTING A TENACIOUS 
ERNESTO FROM SIGNIFICANT STRENGTHENING. AS THIS UPPER FEATURE SHIFTS 
WESTWARD AND THE RIDGE TO ITS NORTH SHIFTS SOUTHEASTWARD...SHEAR 
OVER ERNESTO WILL RELAX TO ALMOST NOTHING. AS A RESULT ERNESTO 
SHOULD STRENGTHEN TO A HURRICANE IN THE NEXT 24 HOURS. SHORTLY AFTER 
THIS...ERNESTO MAY BEGIN INTERACTING WITH CUBA. THE DEGREE OF THIS 
INTERACTION WILL BE CRITICAL TO ITS EVENTUAL INTENSITY AS IT NEARS 
AND ENTERS KEYS WATERS ON TUESDAY. THIS INTERACTION COULD BE 
ANYWHERE FROM A FEW HOURS TO A DAY AND A HALF. AS ERNESTO MOVES OFF 
OF CUBA...IT SHOULD BE ABLE TO REINTENSIFY AS IT CONTINUES WEST 
NORTHWESTWARD.

SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...THE WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL DOMINATE KEYS 
WEATHER. EAST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 MPH IS EXPECTED WITH DAY TIME 
CONVECTION FOCUSED ALONG CLOUD BUILD UP NEAR THE KEYS...AND MORE 
RANDOM ACTIVITY AT NIGHT. THIS FLOW SHOULD ALSO KEEP MOST OF SOUTH 
FLORIDAS SEABREEZE CONVECTION AWAY FROM THE KEYS. 

EASTERLY WINDS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE ON MONDAY...AND INCREASE 
FURTHER ON MONDAY NIGHT. WILL GRADUALLY TREND TO HIGHER POPS THROUGH 
THIS PERIOD. AT THIS TIME...TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS OF 39 MPH OR 
HIGHER ARE EXPECTED TO REACH KEYS WATERS LATE MONDAY NIGHT. DIRECT 
IMPACTS TO THE KEYS WILL DEPEND HIGHLY OF COURSE ON ERNESTOS EXACT 
TRACK AND CLOSEST APPROACH TO THE KEYS...BUT ALSO ON THE EXTENT AND 
DURATION OF ANY INTERACTION WITH CUBA. THE LATEST PROBABILITIES FROM 
NHC INDICATE AROUND A 50% CHANCE OF TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS IN 
THE KEYS. THERE IS ALSO A CHANCE OF HURRICANE FORCE WINDS IN OUR 
WESTERN WATERS. ERNESTO IS EXPECTED TO MOVE NORTHWESTWARD PAST KEYS 
WATERS TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH CONDITIONS IMPROVING THEREAFTER.

&&

.MARINE...
MARINERS SHOULD CONTINUE TO CHECK FORECASTS REGULARLY THROUGH THE 
REST OF THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK SINCE THEY WILL DEPEND 
SIGNIFICANTLY UPON WHAT ERNESTO DOES. TODAY AND TONIGHT...WINDS WILL 
BE MAINLY EASTERLY 10 TO 15 KNOTS. MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...WINDS 
WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE AS ERNESTO NEARS KEYS WATERS. AT THIS 
TIME...TROPICAL STORM FORCE WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO ENTER KEYS WATERS 
LATE MONDAY NIGHT. THE CURRENT TRACK BRINGS HURRICANE FORCE WINDS TO 
ZONE 75 ON TUESDAY. ERNESTO WILL DEPART KEYS WATERS TUESDAY NIGHT. 
CONDITIONS WILL THEN GRADUALLY IMPROVE...WITH WINDS AND SEAS 
DECREASING.

&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THIS EVENING ALONG THE 
KEY WEST TO MIAMI AVIATION AND ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS WITH IFR 
VISIBILITIES IN STRONGER CELLS. WINDS AT KEY WEST AND MARATHON WILL 
BE GENERALLY FROM THE EAST BETWEEN 5 AND 10 KNOTS...WITH WINDS OFF 
THE DECK THROUGH FL100 EASTERLY LESS THAN 15 KNOTS.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
330 PM EDT FRI AUG 25 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IS WEAK AND BROAD...AND
APPARENTLY ITS AXIS REMAINS OVER THE BAHAMAS TO NEAR THE FLORIDA 
KEYS. LOWER KEYS AREA WINDS ARE STILL FROM THE SOUTH AT SPEEDS 5 KT 
OR SO...WHILE MID AND UPPER KEYS GAUGES ARE SHOWING SOME VARIABLE 
WINDS. SEA BREEZE CIRCULATIONS HAVE SET IN AROUND THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...INCLUDING ON FLORIDA BAY NEAR THE MAINLAND. THE LIGHT 
WIND FLOW HAS LEAD TO SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON CLOUD LINES NORTH 
OF THE LOWER KEYS...WHILE OVER-ISLAND DEVELOPMENT IN COMBINATION 
WITH OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM MAINLAND STORMS HAS LEAD TO SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE UPPER KEYS...ESPECIALLY KEY LARGO. THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS REMAIN RELATIVELY QUIET SHOWER-WISE EXCEPT FOR 
WATERS OFF KEY LARGO WHERE STORMS WILL BE MOVING IN FROM THE WEST. 
A LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION AT HIGH LEVELS IS SEEN JUST SOUTH OF 
EASTERN CUBA EMBEDDED WITHIN A LENGTHY TUTT (TROPICAL UPPER 
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH)...AND SEEMS TO BE MOVING WESTWARD NOW. 
 
.FORECAST...
TONIGHT...MOISTURE WILL DEEP OVER THE KEYS THROUGH TONIGHT...
PERHAPS ENABLING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM MAINLAND STORMS TO 
CREATE A FEW ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NEAR THE KEYS THIS 
EVENING. AND THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL FOR LATE AFTERNOON DEVELOPMENT 
AS WINDS OVER HOT ISLANDS BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE. 30 PCT CHANCE 
OF RAIN WILL BE RETAINED...BUT THIS MAY PRIMARILY BE FOR EVENING 
HOURS. THE GFS INDICATES SOME HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE YET AGAIN 
TONIGHT...WITH LOW AND MID LEVEL LIFT SHOWING UP OVER THE KEYS 
AROUND 06Z TONIGHT. MOS GUIDANCE IS 20 PCT FOR GFS AND NAM MODELS...
SO I WILL GO AHEAD AND MENTION A DOWN TREND TO SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
PRECIP FOR OVERNIGHT HOURS. THE SURFACE RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO BE NEAR 
THE KEYS...ALLOWING LIGHT WINDS TO BE RATHER VARIABLE. 

SATURDAY...GFS FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT 
CONTINUING IN THE AIR OVER THE KEYS. THE SURFACE RIDGE IS FORECAST 
TO LIFT A BIT NORTHWARD...AND THE GFS HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH A 
LIGHT ENE FLOW SETTING IN THE LATTER PART OF THE DAY. IF SO...THIS
PATTERN WILL PROMOTE OVER-ISLAND SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM FORMATION.
THEREFORE...40 PCT POPS (A BIT ABOVE CLIMO) WILL BE RETAINED. 
BOTH NAM AND GFS MOS HAVE 50 PERCENTERS...SO AN UPWARD NUDGE MAY
BE WARRANTED IF THE FORECASTED WIND FIELDS PERSIST INTO THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF MODEL RUNS. 

SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...LOWER LEVEL WINDS SHOULD BECOME EAST OR 
EVEN EAST-NORTHEAST AT INCREASING SPEEDS...INTO THE 10-15 MPH RANGE. 
A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF DRYING ALOFT IS INDICATED FOR SUNDAY...IN THE
850-700 MB LEVEL. MODEL OUTPUT FOR THE GFS HAS 20 PCT POPS FOR SAT 
NIGHT THROUGH SUN NIGHT...NAM MOS HAS 20 AND 30 PCT POPS. I WILL 
KEEP ONGOING 30 PCT POPS FOR NOW...AS NOCTURNAL SHOWER FORMATION MAY 
BRING SHOWERS IN ON THE INCREASED EAST LOW LEVEL FLOW...WHILE SUNDAY 
WINDS MAY BE SOMEWHAT ENE FAVORING CLOUD LINE FORMATION OVER 
ISLANDS...IF WIND SPEEDS DONT INCREASE TOO MUCH. 

SUNDAY NIGHT...LOWER POPS MAY STILL BE IN ORDER IF HIGH LEVEL DRYING 
STAYS OVER THE KEYS...BUT I WILL NOT STRAY FROM THE CURRENTLY 
FORECAST 40 PCT POPS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY. IT APPEARS THAT A CONTINUED 
INCREASE IN E OR ENE BREEZES IS IN STORE...DUE TO THE COMBINATION OF 
THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH INCREASING A BIT...WHILE 
PRESSURES BEGIN TO FALL IN THE CENTRAL AND WEST CARIBBEAN ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE APPROACH FROM THE EAST OF A TROPICAL CYCLONE...NOW CALLED
TD NUMBER 5. 

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THIS TIME FRAME IS THE CURRENT BEST ESTIMATE
OF WHEN THE TROPICAL SYSTEM IN THE CARIBBEAN MIGHT MOST IMPACT THE 
KEYS...WITH AN INCREASED PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE AREA BETWEEN
LOW PRESSURE IN THE CARIBBEAN AND HIGH PRESSURE OVER NORTH FLORIDA. 
EXTENDED GFS MOS HAS 50-60 PCT 12 HOUR CHANCES OF PRECIP...BUT FOR 
NOW I WILL MAINTAIN ONGOING 40 PERCENTERS FOR CONTINUITY UNTIL WE
SEE MORE CERTAIN TRACKING, TIMING, AND STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM. 

TUESDAY NIGHT-WEDNESDAY...A WEAKER FLOW FROM THE SE TO S...BUT
STILL VERY MOIST...IS INDICATED FOR THE KEYS. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT-FRIDAY...I WILL LOWER POPS TO 30 PCT BASED ON LESS
DEPTH TO THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT OVER THE KEYS. A LIGHTER SE WIND 
FLOW IS INDICATED.
&&

.MARINE...
THE WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN NEAR THE KEYS TONIGHT 
AND EARLY SATURDAY...KEEPING LIGHT (10 KT OR LESS) VARIABLE WINDS
OVER MOST KEYS WATERS. THE RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT TO THE NORTH
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...TURNING AREA WINDS TO E OR ENE...NEAR 10 KT FOR 
ATLANTIC WATERS. WATCH FOR AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
AN INCREASE IN E OR ENE WINDS IS EXPECTED SUNDAY...MAYBE UP TO 15 
KT...AS LOWER PRESSURES MOVE INTO THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN AND
HIGH PRESSURE IS ESTABLISHED FARTHER NORTH OF THE KEYS. BOATERS NEED 
TO CHECK LATER FORECASTS CAREFULLY FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...AS
THE PASSAGE OF A TROPICAL SYSTEM OVER THE CARIBBEAN MAY DIRECTLY OR 
INDIRECTLY AFFECT KEYS WINDS IN COMBINATION WITH HIGH PRESSURE TO 
OUR NORTH. 
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE THROUGH 
02Z...OTHERWISE ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
FOUND ALONG THE ROUTE. WIND GUSTS OF 30 TO 35 KNOTS MAY ACCOMPANY 
THE HEAVIER ACTIVITY. WINDS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS WILL 
AVERAGE 180/5KTS LATE THIS AFTERNOON...AND BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE.

COASTLINE. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FORMING NEAR OR OVER KEYS 
ISLANDS SHOULD DRIFT N OR NW OVER BAY AND GULF WATERS THIS 
AFTERNOON.
&&

.AVIATION...
THIS MORNING...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL PRODUCE BRIEF PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR CONDITIONS. AFTER

RADAR SHOW FEWER SHOWERS AROUND THE IMMEDIATE AREA THAN ANY RECENT 
MORNING. A HIGH LEVEL LOW CENTER IS SEEN SPINNING OVER EASTERN 
CUBA...AND THERE CONTINUES TO BE A BAND OF DRIER AIR ALOFT AROUND 
THE NORTH AND WEST SIDES OF THE LOWS CIRCULATION...AFFECTING THE 
CENTRAL BAHAMAS TO CENTRAL CUBA. MEANWHILE DESPITE THE LESSER SHOWER 
COVERAGE OVER THE KEYS...THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS 
CONTINUED HIGH ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE CONTENT OVER THE AREA 
(PRECIPITABLE WATER IS 2.13 INCHES) AND THERE ARE SMALL CLOUD LINES 
ORIENTED WITH THE SE TO NW LOW LEVEL FLOW...SOME OF WHICH HAVE 
DEVELOPED SHOWERS OVER FLORIDA BAY. 
 
.FORECAST...
LATEST GFS AND NAM MODELS NOW SHOW THE WEAK RIDGE KEEPING SE TO S 
SURFACE WINDS BLOWING AT LIGHT SPEEDS OVER THE KEYS AND ATLANTIC 
WATERS...WHILE THE OLD NGM HAS A GULF HIGH PRESSURE CELL FORMING AND 
DISRUPTING WIND FLOW OVER WESTERN AREAS LATE TODAY. IN EITHER CASE...
WIND SPEEDS STILL ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT OVER THE KEYS...AND THIS 
MAY ALLOW FOR SOME NEAR-ISLAND BUILD-UPS, SHOWERS, AND THUNDERSTORMS
...ALTHOUGH A LIGHT SE TO S FLOW MAY NUDGE THEM TO THE NORTH SIDE OF 
ISLANDS. NO UPDATE TO ZONES IS PLANNED.

TIMES...BUT A SEA BREEZE WILL AFFECT FLORIDA BAY NEAR THE MAINLAND 
COASTLINE. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FORMING NEAR OR OVER KEYS 
ISLANDS SHOULD DRIFT N OR NW OVER BAY AND GULF WATERS THIS 
AFTERNOON.
&&

.AVIATION...
THIS MORNING...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL PRODUCE BRIEF PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR CONDITIONS. AFTER 
17Z...COVERAGE OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND WILL INCREASE TO 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO SEA 
BREEZE ACTIVITY. AS FOR THE MARINE PORTION OF THE ROUTE...ACTIVITY

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND MODEL INITIAL ANALYSIS SHOW THE AXIS OF THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE PUSHING ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA.  
THUS WINDS AT CMAN AND ISLAND STATIONS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AROUND 5 KNOTS. KEY WEST 00Z SOUNDING SHOWED A SLIGHT 
SUBSIDENCE INVERSION AROUND 900MB WITH LIGHT WINDS ALL THE WAY 
THROUGH THIRTY THOUSAND FEET. SOUNDING PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 
WERE VERY NEAR TWO INCHES...AND FSL GPS BASED PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES HAVE BEEN IN THAT GENERAL VICINITY SINCE THE SOUNDING.
 
.FORECAST...
TODAY AND SATURDAY...WITH MAINLY LIGHT WINDS THROUGH THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER...MESOSCALE PROCESSES WILL DOMINATE. GIVEN THAT PW VALUES NEAR 
TWO INCHES SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP ALONG CUMULUS LINES AND TRANSIENT 
DENSITY BOUNDARIES. GFS MODEL GUIDANCE HAS THE RIDGE AXIS BEGINNING 
TO LIFT NORTHWARD LATE SATURDAY AS TD5 MOVES INTO THE CENTRAL 
CARIBBEAN. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL ALSO BEGIN TO DROP LATE 
SATURDAY AS MID AND UPPER LEVEL DRIER AIR MOVES IN FROM THE BAHAMAS 
ON THE HEELS OF AN UPPER LOW MOVING INTO THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN. WILL 
BUMP POPS UP JUST A BIT FOR TODAY.

SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...IF THE CURRENT TROPICAL FORECAST 
HOLDS...TD5 WILL BE IN THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN AND THE UPPER LOW IN 
THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN. THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN 
AND DEEP EASTERLY FLOW WILL SET IN. GFS GUIDANCE SHOWS PRECIPITABLE 
WATER DROPPING SLIGHTLY WITH DRYING IN THE MID AND UPPER 
ATMOSPHERE...BUT CERTAINLY NOT ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE SHOWER ACTIVITY. 
WINDS OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS WILL INCREASE TO NEAR 15 KNOTS...WITH 
10 TO 15 KNOTS ELSEWHERE.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY DURING THIS PERIOD 
BECAUSE MUCH DEPENDS ON THE TRACK OF TD5. IF A PERFECT FORECAST 
ASSUMPTION IS MADE...THE EFFECTS OF THE TROPICAL SYSTEM IN THE KEYS 
AND SURROUNDING WATERS WILL BE ANCILLARY. AS THE STORM MOVES TO OUR 
SOUTH THROUGH THE CARIBBEAN...WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MAINLY 
EASTERLY IN THE 15 KNOT RANGE.

&&

.MARINE...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND COASTAL WATERS WILL KEEP 
WINDS MOSTLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON. SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG CLOUD LINES MAINLY IN THE 
MORNING THROUGH AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY 
OCCUR AT ANY TIME. ON SUNDAY...WINDS WILL INCREASE TO NEAR 15 KNOTS 
OVER THE STRAITS...AND 10 TO 15 KNOTS ELSEWHERE...AS THE TROPICAL 
DEPRESSION MOVES THROUGH THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN.

&&

.AVIATION...
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS 
THIS MORNING. BY MID DAY COVERAGE WILL INCREASE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA 
DUE TO SEA BREEZE ACTIVITY. COVERAGE OVER THE MARINE PORTION OF THE 
ROUTE...ACTIVITY WILL TEND TO FOCUS OVER AND NEAR THE ISLAND CHAIN. 
SURFACE WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE.

THE ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS STILL EXTENDS WEST OVER THE SOUTHERN TIP OF 
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND EXTREME UPPER KEYS...PRODUCING LIGHT S 
WINDS OVER THE UPPER KEYS...SE WINDS ELSEWHERE IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE. 
A SHIP OUT IN THE STRAITS WELL SOUTH OF THE MIDDLE KEYS REPORTED 
WINDS AT 10 KT AT 2 PM. MAX WIND SPEEDS ARE PROBABLY NEAR 10 KT IN 
THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE STRAITS. GULF AND FLORIDA BAY WATERS 
MAY BE CLOSER TO 5 KT EXCEPT NEAR THE SEA BREEZES OF THE MAINLAND. 
A LARGE SWATH OF SHOWERS, THUNDERSTORMS AND CLOUDINESS (SEVERAL 
HUNDRED MILES LONG) IS STILL SEEN ON SATELLITE EXTENDING FROM THE 
ATLANTIC NE OF THE BAHAMAS...THEN ACROSS THE NW BAHAMAS. THERE IS A 
GENERALIZED REGION OF CONVERGING WIND DIRECTION WITHIN THIS ZONE...
BUT ALSO AT HIGH LEVELS (200 MB) NUMERICAL ANALYSES SHOW THIS AREA 
ON THE EDGE OF STRONGER WINDS ALOFT (AND HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE 
FIELD) ASSOCIATED WITH THE NW AND N PERIPHERY OF A DEVELOPING TUTT 
LOW CENTERED NEAR EASTERN CUBA. CONVECTION OVER THE KEYS AND NEARBY 
WATERS HAS WANED WITH JUST ISOLATED ACTION AT THIS TIME...WHILE
LARGE LAND MASSES AROUND US ARE STILL DEVELOPING DIURNAL CONVECTION. 
A SLIGHTLY DRIER AIRMASS ALOFT IS SEEN IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER 
THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. 

.FORECAST...
THE NAM MODEL IS DISREGARDED DUE TO NOISE FROM CONTINUED SPURIOUS 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE FORMATION AROUND THE REGION. THE GFS MODEL WILL 
BE MORE CLOSELY ADHERED TO...EXCEPT CAUTION IS USED IN LATER PERIODS
FROM MONDAY INTO WEDNESDAY ON THE GRIDS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT 
TROPICAL EVOLUTION IN THE CARIBBEAN. 

TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...A WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IS 
STILL INDICATED TO VARY SLIGHTLY SOUTHWARD AND NORTHWARD OVER THE
KEYS...GIVING LIGHT WIND SPEEDS WITH VARYING DIRECTIONS. DURING THIS 
TIME...MOISTURE WILL BE PLENTIFUL ALTHOUGH SOME SLIGHTLY LESS 
RELATIVELY HUMIDITY VALUES ARE DEPICTED BY THE GFS MODEL IN THE
3-8 THSD FT AGL LEVELS. LOW POPS NEAR 20 PCT WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR 
TONIGHT PER ALL MODEL OUTPUT...ALTHOUGH SMALL SCALE BOUNDARIES COULD 
FIRE OVERNIGHT SHOWERS. ALSO THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...THERE REMAIN 
ELUSIVE PERIODS OF DIVERGENCE AT 200 MB OVER THE REGION...AND SOME 
LOWER TO MID LEVEL LIFT SHOWING UP LATE TONIGHT. THEREAFTER...
30 PCT POPS FOR FRI AND FRI NIGHT IN THE LIGHT WIND FLOW...WILL
ALSO BE RETAINED. 

SATURDAY...THE SURFACE RIDGE OUGHT TO LIFT NORTH SOME IN THE 
AFTERNOON...AND INDICATIONS ARE FOR A NE TO E WIND TO SET IN AT THE 
SURFACE...STILL LIGHT SPEEDS. THIS WOULD BE A FAVORABLE DIRECTION 
FOR AFTERNOON TCU/CB DEVELOPMENT OVER OR NEAR THE KEYS ISLANDS.
40 PCT POPS ARE STILL WARRANTED. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...SOME DRYNESS ALOFT (ABOVE 850 
MB) IS SHOWN THROUGH THIS PERIOD...BUT AT THE SAME TIME THE SURFACE 
RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO BE FARTHER NORTH OF THE KEYS WITH A MORE WELL 
DEFINED LOW LEVEL FLOW FROM A GENERAL EAST DIRECTION. 40 PCT POPS 
WILL BE RETAINED AT THIS TIME...BASED ON TENDENCY OF WINDS TO BE 
MORE ENE IN THE AFTERNOON AIDING OVER-ISLAND SHOWER DEVELOPMENT...
AND THERE MAY BE SOME NIGHT AND MORNING FAVORED OCEAN SHOWER 
FORMATION THAT WILL BLOW INTO THE KEYS. IF THE DRYNESS IS MORE 
PRONOUNCED THAN MODELS SHOW...30 PCT POPS MAY BE MORE IN TUNE.

TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...MODELS VARY WITH REGARD TO DETAILS OF 
TROPICAL DEVELOPMENT AND PLACEMENT IN THE CARIBBEAN. THE LATEST GFS 
HAS A WELL DEFINED TROUGH/WAVE EXTENDING NORTH FROM THE CARIBBEAN
TO THE BAHAMAS MONDAY...APPROACHING THE KEYS AREA TUESDAY...THEN
PLACING THE KEYS IN DEEP SE MOIST FLOW WED AND THU. THIS IS ALL 
UNCERTAIN...AND LATER PERIOD FORECAST PERIODS WILL FOLLOW SUBSEQUENT 
NHC/HPC GUIDANCES. 

.MARINE...
A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE NEAR THE KEYS WILL KEEP WIND SPEEDS LIGHT
(10 KT OR LESS) TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. MAINLY SE TO S 
DIRECTIONS TONIGHT SHOULD GO MORE VARIABLE FRI AND FRI NIGHT. 
THE RIDGE WILL SHIFT FARTHER NORTH SAT...ENABLING WINDS TO TURN
NE TO E IN THE AFTERNOON. A BIT LARGER HIGH PRESSURE AREA SAT NIGHT 
INTO SUN AND MON MAY TAKE E WINDS (THEY MAY BE ENE AT TIMES) TO NEAR 
15 KT OVER STRAITS WATERS AND 10-15 KT FOR BAY AND GULF WATERS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS NOW EXTENDS WEST OVER MIAMI-DADE COUNTY...
PRODUCING LIGHT S WINDS OVER THE UPPER KEYS...SE WINDS ELSEWHERE
IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE. GULF AND FLORIDA BAY WATERS PROBABLY ARE 
TENDING TO S OR SSE. A LARGE SWATH OF CONVECTION (SEVERAL HUNDRED 
MILES LONG) IS SEEN ON SATELLITE EXTENDING FROM THE ATLANTIC NE OF 
THE BAHAMAS...THEN ACROSS THE NW BAHAMAS...TO JUST OFF THE UPPER 
KEYS. SURFACE WINDS SHOW A GENERALIZED REGION OF CONVERGING WIND 
DIRECTION WITHIN THIS ZONE. A BATCH OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS 
INCREASED THE PAST 2 HOURS AROUND THE LOWER KEYS...WHICH ALSO IS 
HARD TO EXPLAIN BUT ALMOST SEEMS TO BE RELATED TO THE LARGE SWATH OF 
CONVECTION EXTENDING SW OFF THE ATLANTIC. THE MORNING KEY WEST 
SOUNDING IS SIMILAR TO PAST DAYS...WITH HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT 
(PW=2.15 INCHES). GOES SOUNDER AND SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY 
SHOW A BAND OF DRIER AIR ALOFT OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. 

.FORECAST...
I DONT PLAN TO UPDATE ZONES AT THIS POINT. THE PROLIFERATION OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND THE LOWER KEYS AT THIS TIME WILL
PROBABLY WANE BY LATE MORNING OR MID DAY. WIND FLOW REMAINS LESS 
THAN IDEAL FOR AFTERNOON TCU/CB LINE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE KEYS...
AND EVEN THE GFS MODEL SHOWS A SLIGHT LESSENING OF MOISTURE AT THE 
5000 FT AGL LEVEL THIS AFTERNOON ( NOT ENOUGH TO SHUT OFF CONVECTION 
HOWEVER).

LINES ALONG AND NEAR THE ISLANDS. DUE TO THE SLOW MOTION OF SUCH 
SHOWERS AND STORMS...ANY MVFR OR IFR CONDITIONS NEAR THE ISLAND 
TERMINALS COULD LAST OVER A HALF AN HOUR. WINDS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH 
TERMINALS WILL AVERAGE 130/4-8KTS.

ALONG THE KMIA-60SW KMIA PORTION OF THE ROUTE...MAINLY VFR 
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THIS MORNING...WITH ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY NEAR THE SOUTHEAST FL COAST. BY EARLY 
AFTERNOON...CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP OVER MUCH OF THE MAINLAND

.CURRENTLY...
LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING AN INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY ON THE DISTANT WATERS BEYOND 20 MILES SOUTH OF THE LOWER 
AND MIDDLE KEYS. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WEAK WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE EXTENDING ACROSS EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA...WITH AN 
EAST-WEST ORIENTED TROUGH LYING ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. 
ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE MOSTLY 
EAST WINDS OF LESS THAN 10 KNOTS. MEANWHILE...GOES-12 WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY SHOW A WELL PRONOUNCED TROPICAL UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH 
(TUTT) LOW CENTERED OVER EXTREME SOUTHEAST CUBA...AND THE ADJACENT 
ATLANTIC AND CARIBBEAN WATERS. ON THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THE 
LOW...CONSIDERABLE DEEP AND WET CONVECTION IS OCCURRING.  

.FORECAST...
A WELL PRONOUNCED (TUTT) LOW OVER THE EASTERN PORTION OF CUBA AND 
THE ADJACENT ATLANTIC AND CARIBBEAN WATERS TODAY...WILL MIGRATE 
SLOWLY WEST SOUTHWESTWARD INTO THE EXTREME NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN BY 
LATE SUNDAY AS A LARGE ANTICYCLONE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES. THIS LATTER FEATURE WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK WESTWARD INTO THE 
GULF OF MEXICO EARLY NEXT WEEK...AS THE RIDGE SETTLES DOWN THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA. MEANWHILE...A WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE 
WILL LIE NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS THROUGH FRIDAY...BEFORE 
GRADUALLY LIFTING NORTHWARD AND PINCHING OFF INTO TWO AREAS OF HIGH 
PRESSURE SUNDAY AND MONDAY. THEREAFTER...A TROPICAL WAVE...CURRENTLY 
EAST OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS...WILL MOVE INTO THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE LATEST GFS RUN INDICATES THE NORTHERN EXTENT OF 
THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE/WAVE WILL REACH INTO OUR AREA TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...BEFORE EMERGING INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF THURSDAY. ON THE 
OTHER HAND...UKMET KEEPS THIS DISTURBANCE MUCH FURTHER SOUTH IN THE 
CARIBBEAN...BUT REGARDLESS...ITS WAY TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE ON THE 
TRACK. MOREOVER...GFS INDICATES CONSIDERABLE 20 TO 30 KNOT NORTH TO 
NORTHEAST SHEAR OVER THE ENTIRE WESTERN CARIBBEAN. OTHERWISE...ON 
THIS DATE IN 1992...CATEGORY 5 HURRICANE ANDREW WAS MAKING LANDFALL 
INTO EXTREME SOUTHEAST FLORIDA. 

TODAY AND TONIGHT...
WITH THE LOW LEVEL WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE LYING JUST NORTH OF OUR 
REGION...A MORE DISCERNIBLE SOUTHEAST FLOW SHOULD DEVELOP. 
FURTHERMORE...WITH THE DEEP LAYERED (1000-500 MB) RIDGE NEARBY...A 
SUBTLE DECREASE IN MOISTURE ALONG WITH A MORE STABLE THERMODYNAMIC 
ENVIRONMENT SHOULD OCCUR. SUBSEQUENTLY...WILL DROP POPS TO 30 
PERCENT. FOR TONIGHT...A LIGHT SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WIND OF 5 TO 10 
KNOTS SHOULD NOT ALLOW CUBAN STORMS OR OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES TO MIGRATE 
INTO OUR REGION...SO 20 PERCENT POPS SEEM REASONABLE.

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...
WITH THE DEEP LAYERED (1000-500 MB) RIDGE AXIS ALIGNED NEAR OUR 
REGION...BELIEVE GFS FORECAST PWAT VALUES ARE A TOUCH OVERDONE. 
HOWEVER...A LIGHT AND CHAOTIC WIND FIELD COMBINED WITH STRONG LATE 
AUGUST INSOLATION WILL PROMPT CLIMO 30 PERCENT POPS. ALTHOUGH WITH A 
LIGHT WIND FLOW...POPS MAY ONCE AGAIN HAVE TO BE LOWERED INTO THE 
ISOLATED CATEGORY FRIDAY NIGHT.

SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...
WITH THE TUTT LOW TRACKING THROUGH THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN...WEAK 
UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE MAY PROVIDE SOME LARGE SCALE LIFT. IN 
ADDITION...A FAVORABLE NORTHEAST TO EAST LOW LEVEL WIND FLOW SHOULD 
ALLOW CLOUD LINES TO FORM NEAR THE ISLAND CHAIN ALONG WITH A FEW 
STORMS POSSIBLY DROPPING SOUTHWESTWARD OFF THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
MAINLAND. HENCE...40 PERCENT POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THIS 
PERIOD. 

SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...
WEAK UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TUTT LOW OVER THE 
NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN COMBINED WITH A DEEPENING EASTERLY FLOW WILL 
PROMPT SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMO POPS FOR THIS PERIOD.

TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WITH THE EXTENT AND LOCATION OF 
THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN DURING THIS 
PERIOD. WITH THAT SAID...PLENTY OF MOISTURE (PWAT VALUES OF AROUND 2 
INCHES) WITHIN A DEEP EASTERLY FLOW WILL PROVIDE ABOVE AVERAGE POPS 
INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. 

&&

.MARINE...
WITH THE ATLANTIC RIDGE HOVERING OUR REGION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS...LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL LIKELY BECOME VARIABLE FRIDAY AND 
FRIDAY NIGHT. THEREAFTER...A DISCERNIBLE EASTERLY FLOW SHOULD 
EVOLVE...AND GRADUALLY INCREASE SUNDAY INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
HENCE...NO EXERCISE CAUTION STATEMENTS OR ADVISORIES ARE ANTICIPATED 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 

&&

.AVIATION...
BUOYANCY IS ABUNDANT. ONCE WEAK INHIBITION IS OVERCOME...AN 
AFTERNOON CLOUD LINE IN THE LOWER KEYS SHOULD PRODUCE ISOLATED 
MVFR/IFR CIGS AND VSBYS IN THE VICINITY OF THE KEY WEST TERMINAL. 
SCATTERED COVERAGE IS LIKELY ON THE MAINLAND LEG OF THE ROUTE MIAMI 
TO KEY WEST. SHEAR IS WEAK SO CELL MOVEMENT SHOULD BE SLOW AND

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS POSITIONED ACROSS 
THE BAHAMAS NEAR NASSAU...THENCE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA. THIS IS BASED ON WIND FLOW OVER THE BAHAMAS...
BUT BASED PRESSURES OVER THE PENINSULA AND KEYS SINCE SEA BREEZE 
CIRCULATIONS HAVE DISRUPTED THE SYNOPTIC PRESSURE GRADIENT FLOW. 
A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE CELL IS STILL SUGGESTED IN WIND FLOW OVER THE 
SE GULF NOT FAR OFFSHORE FROM SW FLORIDA. WINDS OVER THE KEYS HAVE 
BEEN VARIABLE FOR THE MOST PART...ALTHOUGH LATE MORNING THROUGH 
EARLY AFTERNOON A LIGHT NE TO ENE FLOW OVER THE MIDDLE AND LOWER 
KEYS...AND VERY LIGHT FLOW OVER THE UPPER KEYS...ALLOWED ISLAND 
HEATING TO GENERATE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DIRECTLY OVER KEYS 
ISLANDS. SEVERAL WATERSPOUTS WERE OBSERVED IN NEARSHORE WATERS AS 
WELL. MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS CONVECTION HAS RAINED OUT FOR THIS 
MOMENT...WHILE LOWER KEYS SHOWERS ARE STILL IN PROGRESS BUT 
THUNDERSTORM TOPS HAVE DECREASED. AROUND THE REGION...NO ORGANIZED 
CONVECTIVE PATTERNS ARE SEEN...JUST GENERALIZED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE EAST GULF AND WEST BAHAMAS ASSOCIATED WITH 
SOME HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE...AND DIURNAL STORMS OVER CUBA, LARGER 
ISLANDS, AND THE FLORIDA MAINLAND. 


.FORECAST...
THE LATEST NAM MODEL RUN HAS SPURIOUS SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREAS...
SEEMINGLY OVERDONE REFLECTIONS OF HIGH LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATIONS.
THIS IS NOT NEW. THESE WILL BE DISCOUNTED SINCE THEY ARE CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO THE KEYS FOR INFLUENCE ON LOCAL WIND FLOW. THE GFS WILL 
AGAIN BE MORE CLOSELY ADHERED TO...ALTHOUGH THE GFS ITSELF HAS 
RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY PROBLEMS WITH THE UPCOMING PERIOD OF LIGHT 
WIND FLOW...AND DETAILS OF A WIND FLOW INCREASE DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE 
FORMATION TO OUR NORTH THIS WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK. 

TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...GFS MODEL INDICATES SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE WILL REMAIN NEAR THE KEYS...GIVING A LIGHT LOW LEVEL 
WIND FLOW. SMALL VARIATIONS ARE SEEN DAY-TO-DAY THAT WILL AFFECT 
EFFICIENCY OF DAYTIME ISLAND HEATING TO FORM SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER LAND AREAS. ON THE WHOLE...THE WEAK RIDGE MAY 
KEEP LIGHT VARIABLE WINDS TONIGHT OVER GULF AND BAY WATERS...BUT
BY LATE TONIGHT THE GFS SHOWS A TURN OF ATLANTIC WINDS TO E AND 
SE...LIGHT OF COURSE. THEN...THURSDAY WINDS MAY NOT BE AS FAVORABLE 
FOR TCU/CB LINES OVER THE ISLANDS AS WAS TODAY...WITH A MORE SE 
FLOW. LATEST GFS SHOWS THE RIDGE LYING OVER THE KEYS FRIDAY AND 
FRIDAY NIGHT WITH POSSIBLY A PERIOD OF LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS 
AGAIN...WHICH MAY AID DAYTIME SHOWERS OVER ISLANDS. DURING THIS 
TIME...200-300 MB EPISODES OF DIVERGENCE ARE SHOWN TO PASS OVER THE 
KEYS REGION ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH LEVEL FLOW ON THE NW SIDE OF A 
DEVELOPING LOW OVER CUBA WITHIN THE TUTT (TROPICAL UPPER 
TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH.) MOISTURE REMAINS DEEP OVER THE KEYS...EXPECT 
THAT THE GFS SHOWS A PERIOD OF SOME DRYING JUST ABOVE THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. I AM GOING TO KEEP 40 PCT POPS IN 
PLACE...WHICH MAY FAVOR DAYTIME PERIODS A BIT DUE TO LIGHT WIND 
FLOW. IF THE LOWER LEVEL DRYING COMES ABOUT...POPS FOR FRI AND SAT 
MAY BE A SHADE LOWER THAN 40 PCT. 

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...LATEST GFS RUN DOES NOT BUILD HIGH 
PRESSURE SOUTH TO THE KEYS AS STRONGLY AS BEFORE...BUT STILL HAS 
INDICATIONS THAT HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN STATES INTO NORTH 
FLORIDA WILL TURN KEYS WINDS TO A MORE DEFINITE EAST (OR NORTHEAST) 
FLOW WITH A BIT MORE MODERATE BREEZE. MOISTURE STAYS THE SAME...
SO 40 PCT POPS ARE IN PLAY. 

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THE GFS NO LONGER IS JUMPING ON A 
TROPICAL LOW FORMATION...BUT DOES HAVE A FAIRLY WELL-DEFINED 
TROPICAL WAVE PASSING OVER THE WEST CARIBBEAN. (THIS MAY BE THE WAVE 
CURRENTLY EAST OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS). GFS SHOWS A TURN OF WINDS 
TO SE TO S OVER A DEEP LAYER...WITH DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE...AND
BY TUE NIGHT SOME DEEP LAYER LIFT AS WELL. AT THIS TIME...THE
EXTENDED GFS MOS DOES NOT YET SHOW GREATLY ENHANCED CHANCES OF RAIN 
FOR THIS PERIOD.

INTO THE WEST CENTRAL CARIBBEAN...SOUTH OF HISPANIOLA. 

.FORECAST...
UNTIL NAM RELAXES WITH ITS SPURIOUS CYCLONIC DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
ATLANTIC BASIN...GFS/UKMET WILL BE THE ONLY MEDIUM RANGE MODELS OF 
VALUE. WITH THAT SAID...THE SUMMER DOMINATED BY THE (TUTT) WILL 
CONTINUE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS AS A TUTT OVER THE EASTERN 
PORTION OF THE ISLAND OF CUBA AND THE ADJACENT ATLANTIC AND 
CARIBBEAN WATERS TODAY WILL MIGRATE WESTWARD OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS. A TUTT AXIS IS EXPECTED TO BE NEAR OUR LONGITUDE 
SUNDAY...BEFORE TRACKING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
THE TRICKY FORECAST DILEMMA BECOMES THE IF AND AMOUNT OF UPPER LEVEL 
DIVERGENCE IN OUR REGION. REGARDLESS...GFS FORECAST SOUNDINGS REVEAL 
NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL PWAT VALUES THROUGH THE PERIOD...WHICH 
SHOULD ALLOW MESOSCALE FEATURES TO BE ACTIVE. 

TODAY AND TONIGHT...

SCALE LIFT NOT IMMINENT...MESOSCALE FORCING WILL PROMPT 40 PERCENT 
POPS TODAY AND THIS EVENING...BEFORE TAPERING OFF TO ISOLATED WITHIN 
A LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW. MOREOVER...GFS FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A 
FAVORABLE WIND PROFILE FOR CLOUD LINES DEVELOPING THIS 
AFTERNOON...BUT WILL SCRUTINIZE THE 06Z RUN BEFORE COMMITTING TO 
WATERSPOUT POSSIBILITY IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.  
 
THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
WITH THE DEEP LAYERED (1000-500 MB) RIDGE LYING ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS...SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WILL FILTER IN BUT PWAT VALUES 
SHOULD REMAIN NEAR 1.9 INCHES. AMPLE INSOLATION AND LIGHT WINDS 
MAY ALLOW CLOUD LINES TO FORM NEAR THE ISLAND CHAIN. ONCE

SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN NOCTURNAL. HENCE...40 POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED 
FOR THE DAYTIME AND EVENING...WITH A POSSIBLE DROP OFF TO ISOLATED

.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS EXTENDS WEST OVER 
CENTRAL FLORIDA (SLIGHTLY FARTHER SOUTH THAN ITS POSITION THIS 
MORNING) WITH CURRENT PRESSURES ON THE AXIS OVER FLORIDA AROUND 1019 
MB WHICH IS DOWN SOME FROM THIS MORNING. PRESSURES ARE RELATIVELY 
HIGH OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN (1015 MB AT BUOY 42057 BETWEEN 
JAMAICA AND HONDURAS). AS A RESULT...THE LOCAL PRESSURE GRADIENT 
OVER THE KEYS REMAINS WEAK...AND WINDS HAVE ALMOST BECOME VARIABLE 
IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE AT ISLAND AND NEARSHORE WIND GAUGES. THE LIGHT 
WIND FLOW HAS ALLOWED TCU/CB BUILD-UPS TO FORM DIRECTLY OVER THE 
KEYS...INCLUDING KEY LARGO...MIDDLE KEYS...AND BIG PINE KEY. SOME 
DRIFT TO THE NORTH IS SEEN. THE HUGE CONVECTION THAT WAS OVER THE NW 
CARIBBEAN EARLY TODAY...SENT LARGE AND LONG LIVED OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES 
NORTH OVER THE YUCATAN CHANNEL AND WESTERN CUBA...INTO THE SE GULF...
AND THE EASTERNMOST BOUNDARY IS NOW SCRAPING OUR FORECAST AREA 
WATERS. THIS OUTFLOW AND ITS ASSOCIATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MAY AFFECT DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK IN THE NEXT HOUR. SATELLITE 
CONTINUES TO SHOW SHEETS OF MID AND HIGH CLOUD MOVING NORTH TOWARD 
AND OVER THE KEYS. A LARGE CLUSTER OF STORMS COVERS THE NORTHERN 
BAHAMAS AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC EAST OF THERE. THESE STORMS SEEM 
RELATED TO A HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE WITHIN THE WIND FIELD ON THE 
NORTH SIDE OF A LONG TROPICAL UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH. 

.FORECAST...
THE LATEST NAM MODEL RUN HAS SURFACE LOWS FORMING DOWNWARD ALL THE 
WAY TO THE SURFACE FROM HIGH LEVEL CYCLONIC SPINS. AGAIN...FORECAST 
WINDS WILL BE BASED ON THE GFS MODEL WITH SOME CAUTION. 

TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AS THE 200-300 MB LOW OVER THE NE 
GULF MOVES WEST AND AWAY...THE GFS MODELS INDICATES THAT ANOTHER 
HIGH LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WILL FORM OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS...
WITHIN THE TUTT (TROPICAL UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH) THAT NOW SLICES 
OVER THE OPEN ATLANTIC TO CUBA AND THENCE INTO THE NW CARIBBEAN. 
GFS SHOWS 200 MB DIVERGENCE APPEARING AT TIMES THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT OVER THE NW BAHAMAS, SOUTH FLORIDA, AND THE KEYS WITHIN THE 
DIFFLUENT PATTERN SHAPED BY THE DEVELOPING LOW CENTER. TONIGHT IS A 
PROBLEM SOMEWHAT. LATEST GFS MOS HAS LOW POPS...ONLY 20 PCT FOR 
TONIGHT...WHILE NAM MOS IS 40 PCT. AT MID LEVELS...WINDS ARE 
FORECAST TO GO LIGHT WITH A WEAK RIDGE OVER THE AREA...BUT A HIGH 
LEVEL DIVERGENT FIELD NOW SHOWN OVER THE NW BAHAMAS IS FORECAST TO 
REPOSITION TO NEAR THE UPPER KEYS AND COAST OF THE SE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA. I WILL MAINTAIN THE CURRENT FORECAST OF SCATTERED EVENING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS (ONGOING DEVELOPMENT OVER ISLANDS)...
AND POSSIBLY OTHER FORMATION ON OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES...FOLLOWED BY 
LESSER CHANCE (20 PCT) OVERNIGHT. IF THE DIVERGENT FIELD 
MATERIALIZES...THEN A GROWTH OF MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS IS POSSIBLE 
AFTER MIDNIGHT OR TOWARD MORNING.  I WILL MAINTAIN 50 PCT POPS FOR 
WED AND WED NIGHT...AS THE HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE IS SHOWN BY THE GFS 
TO COME AND GO BUT ON THE WHOLE REMAIN NEARBY. MOISTURE CONTENT 
STAYS HIGH THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...ACTUALLY A FAIRLY SIMILAR PATTERN TO 
THE TONIGHT THROUGH WED NIGHT PERIOD IS SHOWN WITH VARYING AMOUNTS 
OF HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE...AND HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT. 40  PCT POPS 
MAY NEED UPPING IF THIS HOLDS TRUE. NO STRONG MID LEVEL LIFT IS 
SHOWN HOWEVER BY THE VARIOUS MODELS. AND...SURFACE WINDS SHOULD BE 
LIGHT FROM THE E OR SE...SO THAT AFTERNOON BUILD-UPS OVER OR NEAR 
ISLANDS MAY PLAY A ROLE IN DAILY RAINFALL. 

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...THE LATEST GFS IS A BIT SLOWER IN BRINGING 
IN INCREASED EAST WINDS AS THE SURFACE RIDGE SHIFTS NORTH AND 
ENLARGES. PRIOR RUNS HAD A WIND BOOST SATURDAY...NOW IT IS SATURDAY 
NIGHT OR SUNDAY. I WILL MAINTAIN INDICATIONS OF A WIND INCREASE 
SATURDAY FOR CONTINUITY. DRIER AIR ALOFT IS NOW SHOWN FOR THIS TIME 
FRAME...SO 40 PCT POPS ARE OKAY OR MAYBE 30 PCT WILL EVENTUALLY BE
REQUIRED. 

MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...THE GFS NOW HAS A TROPICAL LOW FORMING IN 
THE NW CARIBBEAN. SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST RUN SHOWING SUCH AND DUE 
TO ITS DAY 7 TIMING...NO INDICATIONS OF THIS WILL BE USED IN GRIDS.
THE 06Z GFS RUN FIELDS ARE ADHERED TO. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL KEEP WINDS LIGHT TONIGHT...5-10 KT
OVER BAY AND GULF WATERS AND NEAR ISLANDS...BUT MAY PICK UP CLOSER 
TO 10 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS. WATCH FOR STRONG GUSTS AND LIGHTNING
NEAR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  THE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH IS 
EXPECTED TO SHIFT TO SOUTH FLORIDA AND KEEP WINDS GENERALLY LIGHT
THROUGH FRIDAY. AT THIS TIME...SATURDAY MAY SEE SOME INCREASE IN E 
TO SE WINDS AS THE RIDGE SHIFTS NORTH...BUT TIMING OF THE WIND 
INCREASE IS UNCERTAIN AND IT MAY BE SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY. 
&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH OVERNIGHT...ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE MIAMI TO KEY 
WEST FLIGHT ROUTE. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT ISLAND TERMINALS

AROUND 1021 MB WHICH IS ABOUT 1-2 MB HIGHER THAN MODELS INDICATE FOR 
THIS TIME. DESPITE STRONG CONVECTION OVER THE EXTREME NW CARIBBEAN...
PRESSURES THERE ARE ALSO RELATIVELY HIGH. AS A RESULT...LOCAL 
PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE KEYS IS CURRENTLY SUPPORTING E TO SE 
WINDS 10 KT OR LESS AT ISLAND AND NEARSHORE WIND GAUGES. NO QUIKSCAT 
SATELLITE OR SHIP REPORTS COVERED THE STRAITS THIS MORNING. THE 
CONVECTION OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN SEEMS RELATED TO A HIGH LEVEL 
DIVERGENT PATTERN BUT THIS IS NOT CERTAIN. THE STORM CLUSTERS 
EARLIER OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN HAVE SPAWNED STRONG OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES 
NOW SEEN MOVING NORTH FROM THE YUCATAN CHANNEL AND INTO THE SE GULF 
AND OVER WESTERN CUBA. NEAR THE KEYS...A PULSE OF SMALL SHOWERS 
MOVED NNW OVER THE AREA ALREADY THIS MORNING...BUT THESE HAVE NOW 
DIMINISHED LEAVING SPOTTY LIGHT RAIN AND DEBRIS MID AND HIGH CLOUDS. 
THE MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED A VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE STILL IN PLACE 
OVER THE REGION...WITH KEY WEST PRECIPITABLE WATER MEASURED AT 2.16 
INCHES. VISIBLE SATELLITE CONTINUES TO SHOW A GENERAL PATTERN OF 
SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS OVER THE EAST GULF OF MEXICO...
AND NW BAHAMAS. THIS MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE ON 
THE SE PERIPHERY OF AN UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW NOW CENTERED OVER THE 
NE GULF AND MOVING WEST. ON THE WHOLE THERE IS CURRENTLY LESS 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION OVER THE KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA THAN 24 HOURS 
AGO...AND THE FLORIDA MAINLAND IS MOSTLY SUNNY. 

.FORECAST...
INTERMEDIATE MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS STILL INDICATE 50 PCT CHANCE OF 
PRECIP FOR TODAY...SO NO CHANGE WILL BE MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS. 
SHEETS OF MID AND HIGH CLOUD ARE STILL MOVING NORTH FROM CARIBBEAN 
CONVECTION...WHICH MAY AFFECT THE KEYS.

THE MAJORITY OF ACTIVITY OCCURRING OVER THE DISTANT WATERS 20 TO 60 
MILES SOUTH OF THE MARQUESAS KEYS AND DRY TORTUGAS. 
MEANWHILE...SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE POKING 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...WITH A TROPICAL

DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SOUTHEAST 
WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS...AND NEAR 10 KNOTS 
ON THE FLORIDA BAY AND GULF WATERS. OTHERWISE...GOES-12 WATER 
VAPOR/IR IMAGERY SHOWS A CYCLONIC CIRCULATION OVER THE EXTREME

COLD (-82 DEG C) CONVECTIVE COMPLEX OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN. 

.FORECAST...
A MID AND UPPER LEVEL (200-500 MB) TROUGH EXTENDING FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST GULF OF MEXICO TO THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE WILL MIGRATE 
WESTWARD...BUT ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF TROPICAL UPPER TROPOSPHERIC 
TROUGHS (TUTT) WILL DROP SOUTHWARD OVER THE ISLAND OF CUBA WEDNESDAY

DILEMMA BECOMES THE AMOUNT IF ANY UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE BETWEEN 
THESE SYSTEMS...AS MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO FLUCTUATE ON THE 
TIMING AND AMOUNT. MEANWHILE...A WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE 
STRETCHING ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA

MIGRATE WESTWARD THROUGH OUR REGION FRIDAY NIGHT...AND AGAIN SUNDAY 
NIGHT.    

TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
WITH NO APPARENT LARGE SCALE LIFT OR CONVECTIVE 
INHIBITION...MESOSCALE FORCING APPEARS TO BE THE PRIMARY CONCERN FOR 
PRECIPITATION OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN. FORECAST SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO 
REVEAL THE LOW LEVEL WIND FIELD WILL BACK THIS AFTERNOON. GIVEN 
AMPLE MOISTURE AND MODERATE INSTABILITY...A FAVORABLE WIND PROFILE 
SHOULD GENERATE ACTIVE CLOUD LINES FROM MID AFTERNOON INTO THIS 
EVENING. WITHIN THESE CLOUD LINES...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP ESPECIALLY OVER THE LOWER KEYS. 
MOREOVER...WITH A LACK OF SHEAR...WATERSPOUTS ARE 
POSSIBLE...HENCE...THUNDERSTORMS AND WATERSPOUTS WILL BE INCLUDED IN 
THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK THIS MORNING. 
 
THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
THE COMBINATION OF WEAK UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE AND A DEEPENING 
EASTERLY FLOW WILL PROMPT SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL POPS THROUGH THE 
PERIOD. 

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...
A MINOR LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AXIS MAY PASS THROUGH OUR REGION 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...FOLLOWED BY SOME DRIER AIR SATURDAY 
NIGHT AND SUNDAY. DUE TO TIMING UNCERTAINTY...WILL KEEP 40

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1034 PM EDT MON AUG 21 2006

.DISCUSSION...
LATEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS ARE SHOWING RAIN-FREE CONDITIONS EAST OF 
A LINE FROM EAST CAPE SABLE...TO THE MARQUESAS KEYS...TO 30 MILES 
SOUTH OF DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE DETECTED 
WEST OF THIS LINE....WITH A MEAN CELL MOTION VECTOR OF ABOUT 
130/15KT. BASE REFLECTIVITY IMAGES ALSO SHOW SOUTHWARD-MIGRATING 
BIRDS ACROSS PORTIONS OF SOUTH FLORIDA...FLORIDA BAY...AND THE KEYS. 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY HAS WANED CONSIDERABLY ACROSS THE REGION 
COMPARED TO THE LAST FEW DAYS. EVENING UPPER-AIR OBSERVATIONS 
SUGGEST THAT A MID-LEVEL RIDGE IS BUILDING WESTWARD ACROSS THE 
BAHAMAS...FLORIDA PENINSULA...AND CUBA. THE KEY WEST SOUNDING 
REVEALED 24-HOUR GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT RISES OF 30-40 METERS 
THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE...AND MSL PRESSURES ACROSS THE KEYS ARE 
UP ANOTHER 2-3MB FROM 24 HOURS AGO...INDICATING A BUILDING SURFACE 
RIDGE AS WELL.

LOW- AND MID-LEVEL RIDGING SHOULD CONTINUE TO BUILD ACROSS THE 
REGION OVERNIGHT...WITH INCREASING ANTICYCLONIC FLOW AND SUBSIDENCE 
ON THE SYNOPTIC SCALE. HOWEVER...THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS MOIST IN THE 
SUBCLOUD LAYER WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE STRATIFICATION FROM THE 
SURFACE TO 500MB...AND WEAK CONVECTIVE INHIBITION. LOW-LEVEL 
BOUNDARIES ARE NOT AS PLENTIFUL THIS EVENING AS THEY HAVE BEEN THE 
LAST SEVERAL EVENINGS. DUE TO THESE CONSIDERATIONS...FORECASTS WILL 
BE UPDATED TO REDUCE RAIN CHANCES AND CONVECTIVE COVERAGE. 
HOWEVER...WE WILL MAINTAIN MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO OBSERVED 
VALUES OF INSTABILITY AND WEAK CONVECTIVE INHIBITION...WITH A 
PREFERENCE TOWARD HIGHER RAIN CHANCES AND CONVECTIVE COVERAGE LATE.
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS AT MOST MARINE PLATFORMS ARE CURRENTLY RUNNING EAST-SOUTHEAST 
12-15KT. THIS STEADY MODERATE BREEZE SHOULD PERSIST OVERNIGHT WITH 
LOCALLY HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS NEAR ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AND 
AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 12Z. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR CIGS AND/OR 
VIS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYS ISLAND TERMINALS 
WILL AVERAGE 110/8-12KTS.

.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS MAY HAVE SHIFTED 
SLIGHTLY FARTHER NORTH THIS AFTERNOON BASED ON THE BUOYS OFFSHORE 
FROM CAPE CANAVERAL...AND NOW EXTENDS WEST OVER NORTH CENTRAL 
FLORIDA. A WEAK TROPICAL WAVE IS STILL APPARENT IN WIND FIELDS...
JUST NOW MOVING INLAND OVER THE YUCATAN WITH A SLIGHT REFLECTION OF 
THE WAVE INTO THE SE GULF OF MEXICO AS WELL. KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE 
BEEN VARYING FROM ESE TO SE...WITH SPEEDS OUTSIDE OF CONVECTIVE 
INFLUENCE NEAR 10 KT AT THE REEF AND BAY C-MAN SITES. A DISTURBED 
WEATHER PATTERN IS STILL SEEN ON RADAR AND SATELLITE WITHIN A 
GENERAL SWATH FROM THE BAHAMAS...TO THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS...
THENCE WEST OVER THE SE GULF. CONVECTION IN THIS AREA SEEMS IN PART 
DUE TO HIGH MOISTURE IN THE WAKE OF THE WEAK TROPICAL WAVE...BUT
ENHANCE DUE TO A HIGH LEVEL WIND DIVERGENT PATTERN ON THE SOUTH EDGE 
OF THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW SPINNING NEAR CAPE CANAVERAL. OF NOTE 
ALSO IS A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN TO THE EAST 
OF THE TROPICAL WAVE AXIS...AS WELL AS NEWLY-DEVELOPED DIURNAL 
CONVECTION OVER MOST OF CUBA. 

.FORECAST...
THE NAM MODEL CONTINUES TO DEVELOP QUESTIONABLE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
AREAS AROUND THE REGION...AND THEREFORE ITS SURFACE WIND PATTERN IS
SUSPECT AND WILL NOT BE USED. THE GFS MODEL WILL BE GENERALLY 
ADHERED TO FOR GUIDANCE. 

TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...VERY DEEP MOISTURE (SURFACE UP TO 
ALMOST 500 MB) AND SOME MID LEVEL LIFT IS INDICATED TO BE OVER THE 
KEYS THROUGH THIS PERIOD. FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...THE 200-300 MB 
WIND PATTERN SHOWS SOME DIFFLUENCE AND DIVERGENCE OVER THE KEYS 
REGION AS THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW MOVES WEST TO OUR NORTH...AND A 
HIGH LEVEL ANTICYCLONE IS POSITIONED TO OUR SOUTH. THEREAFTER FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE GFS MODEL SHOWS 
CONTINUED HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE OVER THE KEYS AREA ON THE WEST SIDE 
OF YET ANOTHER UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW CENTER APPROACHING FROM THE 
EAST. IN ADDITION...A DEEP STEERING FLOW FROM THE SE WILL BE IN 
PLACE TONIGHT WHICH MAY BRING UP CUBAN OUTFLOWS. ON THE WHOLE...
THIS PERIOD SHOULD BE CHARACTERIZED BY A SOMEWHAT DISTURBED 
PATTERN...PRODUCING ABOVE NORMAL CHANCES OF PRECIP...WITH MESOSCALE 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES ADDING TO THE MIX. TIMING OF EVENTS IS DIFFICULT. 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON MAY SEE A SURFACE WIND SLIGHTLY MORE FAVORABLE 
FOR OVER-ISLAND SHOWER DEVELOPMENT. MOS OUTPUT SHOWS POPS VARYING 
BETWEEN 30 PCT AND 70 PCT FOR VARIOUS 12 HOUR PERIODS. I WILL 
MAINTAIN AN ACROSS-THE-BOARD 50 PCT CHANCE OF PRECIP DUE TO TIMING 
PROBLEMS. 

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...MOISTURE DEPTH IS SHOWN TO BE 
SLIGHTLY LESS...BUT PLENTIFUL ENOUGH FOR ABOVE NORMAL SHOWER 
CHANCES. THE 200-300 MB LOW CENTER SHOULD MOVE WEST NEAR THE 
KEYS...AND THE HIGH LEVEL PATTERN SHOWS LESS DIVERGENCE.  40 PCT 
POPS ARE RETAINED. 

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...THE GFS MODEL NOW SHOWS EVIDENCE OF A 
TROPICAL WAVE PASSAGE WEST OVER THE KEYS...WITH CURRENT MODEL RUN 
HAVING THE WAVE AXIS PASSING THE KEYS SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY 
MORNING. AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE AGAIN...DEEP LAYERED LIFT...
AND A WIND SURGE FROM THE SE FOLLOWING THE WAVE ARE SHOWN BY THE 
GFS. ITS TOO SOON FOR SPECIFIC RAISING OF POPS AT THIS TIME SINCE

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS REMAINS WELL DEFINED...
EXTENDING WEST OFF THE ATLANTIC AND ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA. A WEAK 
TROPICAL WAVE IS ANALYZED BY THE TROPICAL PREDICTION CENTER OVER THE 
WESTERN CARIBBEAN ALONG 85W. MOORED BUOY 42056 IN THE NW CARIBBEAN 
SHOWS WINDS THERE HAVING TURNED TO SE 14 KT. THE WAVE IN PART IS 
RESPONSIBLE FOR KEYS AREA WINDS HAVING VEERED TO THE SOUTHEAST AS 
WELL. THE MORNING QUIKSCAT PASS JUST MISSED THE KEYS...PASSING TO 
OUR WEST. WIND SPEEDS ARE 10 KT OR LESS AT ISLAND, REEF, AND 
BAY-SIDE WIND GAUGES. WE HAVENT RECEIVED ANY SHIP REPORTS YET THIS 
MORNING. RADAR SHOWS CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING 
SLOWLY NNW OVER THE UPPER KEYS AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC WATERS. A 
GENERALIZED SWATH OF SCATTERED CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
EXTENDS FROM THE BAHAMAS...TO THE SOUTHEAST FLORIDA PENINSULA AND 
UPPER KEYS...THENCE OVER THE SE GULF OF MEXICO. A HIGH LEVEL LOW 
CENTER IS SEEN ON SATELLITE SPINNING JUST OFFSHORE FROM CAPE 
CANAVERAL...WHERE NUMERICAL MODELS INDICATE IT WOULD BE AT THIS 
TIME. OUR LOCAL AIRMASS IS QUITE MOIST...WITH THE MORNING SOUNDING 
SHOWING PRECIPITABLE WATER AT 2.09 INCHES. 

.FORECAST...
INTERMEDIATE MODEL RUNS OF THE GFS AND NAM BOTH SHOW A GENERAL AREA 
OF HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE DUE TO WIND PATTERNS AT 200-300 MB HOVERING 
OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS THROUGH TODAY AND INTO TONIGHT. 
THIS MAY BE MORE PRONOUNCED OVER AREAS TO OUR NORTH...BUT NONETHELESS
MODELS SHOW PERIODS OF ASSOCIATED MID LEVEL LIFT AFFECTING THE KEYS. 
WHILE AT THE MOMENT THERE IS PLENTIFUL SUN OVER MID AND LOWER KEYS 
AND NOT MUCH SHOWER ACTION APART FROM THE UPPER KEYS...THE UPPER 
LEVEL PATTERN STILL SEEMS CONDUCIVE TO SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE DAY. NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES IS PLANNED.
&&

.MARINE...
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA...AND A WEAK TROPICAL 
WAVE MOVING WEST INTO YUCATAN AND CENTRAL AMERICA...WILL MAINTAIN 
MAINLY SE WINDS OVER KEYS WATERS TODAY...BUT DIRECTION MAY TEND TO 
GO CLOSER TO EAST LATE IN THE DAY. SPEEDS SHOULD BE CLOSE TO 10 KT...
OR MAYBE A BIT LESS...MOST OF THE TIME OVER BAY, GULF, AND NEARSHORE 
WATERS OF THE KEYS...BUT 10-15 KT WINDS ARE LIKELY OUT IN THE 
STRAITS. WATCH FOR GUSTINESS NEAR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL DEVELOP OVER THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST 
FLIGHT ROUTE TODAY. OTHERWISE...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ANTICIPATED. VFR CONDITIONS WILL DOMINATE AT ISLAND TERMINALS. THE 
MOVEMENT OF CELLS WILL BE NORTHWEST AT AROUND 10 KNOTS. SURFACE

FROM ISLAND HEATING OF THE LOWER KEYS...WITH THE RESULTING CLOUD 
LINE BLOWING WEST JUST A FEW MILES NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. 
MEANWHILE...A CLUSTER OF LATE AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MOVED OFF THE SW FLORIDA COAST. WHILE THE CLUSTER MOVED WEST AND 
RAINED OUT...IT PRODUCED AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ON ITS SOUTH SIDE THAT 
WAS PROPELLED SW OVER FLORIDA BAY TO THE LOWER KEYS. SECONDARY

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT...A SUDDEN WIND SURGE RESULTED IN WINDS TO 
INCREASE TO BETWEEN 15 AND 20 KNOTS WITH GUSTS OF AROUND 25 KNOTS. 
HOWEVER...THIS INCREASE APPEARS TO BE BRIEF SINCE THE LATEST C-MAN 
STATION PLATFORMS AND SHIP REPORTS REVEAL EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS OF 
AROUND 15 KNOTS...WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WELL WEST OF DRY TORTUGAS...WITH ONLY A FEW 
SHOWERS ELSEWHERE. MEANWHILE...OVERNIGHT SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A 
WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE NOSING ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA...BETWEEN 
TWO BROAD AREAS OF LOW PRESSURE. ONE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS 
MIGRATING WESTWARD THROUGH THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...WHILE THE 
OTHER DIFFUSE AREA IS OFFSHORE OF THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES COAST. GOES-12 WATER VAPORS SHOWS A VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE 
OFFSHORE OF THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES COAST...DIVING 
SOUTHWARD AROUND A HUGE CONTINENTAL ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
THE AFOREMENTIONED (1ST PARAGRAPH) MID AND UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TODAY WILL ROTATE SOUTHWESTWARD 
AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF A MASSIVE CONTINENTAL ANTICYCLONE. THIS 
DISTURBANCE WILL MIGRATE ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA 
SUNDAY...BEFORE DEPARTING INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO MONDAY. 
MEANWHILE...A TROPICAL WAVE WILL TRACK WESTWARD INTO THE EXTREME 
WESTERN CARIBBEAN MONDAY...AS A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE GRADUALLY 
BUILDS ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. 

PRECIPITATION WISE...THE COMBINATION OF PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND A 
SOMEWHAT FAVORABLE EASTERLY FLOW SHOULD GENERATE CLOUD LINES NEAR 
THE ISLAND CHAIN DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS. A DEEP EASTERLY FLOW 
SHOULD PROVIDE LOW CHANCE POPS DURING THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. 
THEREFORE...CLIMO POPS SEEM REASONABLE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL OF 
DAYS. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
GFS INDICATES A WELL PRONOUNCED EASTERLY WAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE 
YUCATAN PENINSULA MONDAY NIGHT...BEFORE LIFTING NORTHWARD INTO THE 
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO AROUND THE OUTER PERIPHERY OF THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE. THIS FEATURE SHIFTS NORTHWARD THROUGH THE EASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO...BEFORE REACHING THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE THURSDAY. 
MEANWHILE...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE HOLDS FIRM JUST TO OUR 
EAST...PROVIDING A CONVEYOR BELT FOR VERY MOIST (PWAT IN EXCESS OF 2 
INCHES) TROPICAL AIR THROUGH AT LEAST MID WEEK. HENCE...WILL NUDGE 
POPS UP TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMO FOR THIS PERIOD. 

&&

.MARINE...
AFTER A BRIEF WIND SURGE EARLY THIS MORNING...WINDS SHOULD RELAX 
QUICKLY LATER THIS MORNING WITH GENTLE TO MODERATE WINDS PREVAILING 
THROUGH THIS WEEKEND. SUBSEQUENTLY...NO EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINES 
OR ADVISORIES APPEAR NECESSARY THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE AXIS AT 00Z (8 PM EDT) IS ANALYZED 
NORTH OF GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND...EXTENDING WEST OVER SOUTH CENTRAL 
FLORIDA. THE RIDGE CONTINUES TO DRIVE KEYS AREA WINDS. LATEST 
MARINE-EXPOSURE GAUGES SHOW EAST WINDS WITH SUSTAINED SPEEDS
10-12 KT...EXCEPT LESSER SPEEDS ON WESTERN WATERS FROM KEY WEST TO 
DRY TORTUGAS. DOPPLER RADAR WIND PROFILE SHOWS WINDS AT 1 THSD FT 
AGL HAVE INCREASED SLIGHTLY OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...TO NEAR 15 KT. 
A FLAIR-UP OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WAS SEEN DURING LATE 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING HOURS ON NEARSHORE WATERS JUST NORTH AND 
WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS...AND FARTHER OUT IN THE STRAITS SOUTH OF THE 
LOWER KEYS. AT THIS TIME...THIS CONVECTION HAS MOVED INTO THE 
WESTERN STRAITS...WHILE A DISSIPATING AREA OF SHOWERS WHICH MOVED 
OFF THE SW MAINLAND OF FLORIDA IS OVER GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE 
LOWER KEYS. NOT MUCH IN THE WAY SHOWERS...OR CLOUD COVER EITHER...IS 
CURRENTLY NOTED OVER THE KEYS OR AREAS TO OUR EAST. GOES SOUNDER 
IMAGES SHOW THAT A SWATH OF LOWER PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES COVERS 
THE MID-UPPER KEYS...SE FLORIDA MAINLAND...AND NW BAHAMAS. A SLICE 
OF HIGHER PW VALUES PUSHED OVER THE SOUTHERN FLORIDA STRAITS AND 
LOWER KEYS...WHICH IS VERIFIED BY THE 1.98 INCH MEASURED PW ON THE 
KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING...AND ACCOUNTS FOR THE LATE DAY SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT JUST NW AND W OF THE LOWER KEYS (ON THE 
DOWNWIND SIDE). THE KEY WEST TEMPERATURE IS STILL AT 85F AT 10 
PM...AND THE DEWPOINT IS 74F.

.FORECAST...
THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN WIND SPEEDS SEEMS TO HAVE SET IN AT THE MORE 
EXPOSED WIND GAUGES...SO PUBLIC ZONES WILL BE UPDATED JUST TO REMOVE 
TRANSITIONAL WORDING. THE GFS MODEL SEEMS TO CAPTURE THE PATTERN OF 
DRIER AIR ALOFT (IN THE 850-700 MB LAYER)...AND INDICATES THAT 
SLIGHTLY DEEPER MOISTURE MAY LINGER NEAR THE LOWER KEYS OVERNIGHT...
THEN THE DRIER AIR (AT 850-700 MB) NOW OVER THE UPPER KEYS WILL MOVE 
WEST OVER THE REGION. ONGOING 20 PCT CHANCE OF PRECIP OVERNIGHT 
SEEMS FINE BASED ON THIS. 
&&

.MARINE...
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDING WEST INTO SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA WILL 
KEEP KEYS AREA WINDS BLOWING FROM THE EAST OR EAST-SOUTHEAST IN THE 
10-15 KT RANGE OVERNIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF 
LOCALIZED MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE. A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES 
AND/OR BRIEF IFR VISIBILITIES ARE POSSIBLE...BUT CONFIDENCE TOO LOW 
FOR INCLUSION IN TWEB FORECAST. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE 
MAINLY EAST AT 6-10 KT.

YOUTH SOUTHWARD INTO THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN SEA. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE 
BENEATH THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING TO THE NORTH AND LOWER PRESSURE TO 
THE SOUTH...ALLOWING FOR GENTLE TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST FLOW. 


.CURRENTLY...TEMPERATURES OVER THE ISLANDS HAVE RISEN TO NEAR 90 
DEGREES...WITH DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 70S. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWEST ACROSS THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS...WITH JUST A FEW MOVING ACROSS THE MIDDLE KEYS. 
SKIES ARE MOSTLY SUNNY OVER THE ISLANDS AND THE ADJOINING WATERS. 
C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND FLORIDA BAY ARE 
REGISTERING EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS NEAR 10 KNOTS WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 
9 AND 13 KNOTS. 

.FORECAST...IN THE UPPER LEVELS...(500 TO 200 MB)...TONIGHT THROUGH 
SATURDAY. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL 
GULF OF MEXICO WILL CONTINUE TO MIGRATE WESTWARD...REACHING THE 
MEXICAN COAST ON SATURDAY. THE SMALLER UPPER LOW THAT IS NOW CLOSEST 
TO THE KEYS AND PRESENTLY MOVING WEST ACROSS THE NORTH CENTRAL CUBAN 
COAST...WILL GRADUALLY MOVE TOWARDS THE YUCATAN BY SATURDAY. THE 
FLORIDA KEYS WILL REMAIN UNDERNEATH THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF A 
LARGE WARM CORE ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
THROUGH SATURDAY. FOR SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...A SMALLER SCALE 
ANTICYCLONE WILL BUILD ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA...THE BAHAMAS...AND THE 
GULF OF MEXICO...WITH 590 DM PLUS 500 MB RIDGING IN PLACE THROUGH 
THIS PERIOD. 

IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...TONIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY...A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BUILD FROM NORTH OF THE BAHAMAS TO ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA. LATEST 
MODEL RUNS ALSO CONTINUE TO VARY IN THEIR TREATMENT IN THE MOVEMENT 
AND STRENGTH OF THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE LOCATED LESS THAN 70 MILES 
OFF OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST...WITH THE 12Z RUN OF THE GFS STILL 
OFF A BIT IN ITS 12Z INITIALIZATION. THIS RUN MOVES THE SYSTEM 
SLOWLY SOUTHWEST...POSSIBLY MOVING THE DISTURBANCE OVER EXTREME 
SOUTH GEORGIA AND NORTH FLORIDA TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THE 12Z RUN OF 
THE NAM CONTINUES TO BE A LEFT OUTLIER AND THIS STILL SEEMS TO BE 
THE LEAST LIKELY SCENARIO WITH THE SYSTEM...MOVING IT SLOWLY 
SOUTHWARD AND PARALLELING THE COAST OF FLORIDA. HAVE CONTINUED THE 
TREND OF CLOSER ADHERENCE TO THE GFS. AMPLE MID AND UPPER LEVEL DRY 
AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE SHOULD 
HOLD POPS NEAR OR SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL THROUGH SATURDAY. 

TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH GFS AND NAM 12 HOUR POPS TONIGHT REMAIN IN THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY...THE GFS FORECAST SOUNDING STILL INDICATES 
THAT BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY WITH 
PWAT BETWEEN 1.75 AND 2.00 INCHES. NEVERTHELESS...DO NOT SEE A 
REASON BASED ON THE SYNOPTIC AND NUMERICAL GUIDANCE TO DEVIATE FROM 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS.

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...A GRADUAL INCREASE IN LOWER TROPOSPHERIC 
MOISTURE IS ANTICIPATED WITH FRIDAYS SURFACE TO 700 MB WINDS 
EASTERLY WINDS INCREASING FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 25 KFT BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT...CONTINUING THROUGH SATURDAY. DESPITE THIS...GFS NUMERICAL 
GUIDANCE CONTINUES TO INDICATE LOW CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
MOST OF THIS WOULD BE ASSOCIATED WITH LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING 
DIURNAL SHOWERS AND STORMS ON THE BREEZE. WILL MAINTAIN CLIMO POPS 
FOR THE PERIOD. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...THE SURFACE RIDGE OVER CENTRAL 
FLORIDA WILL WEAKEN SLIGHTLY AS IT SLIDES TO SOUTH 
FLORIDA...ALLOWING FOR WINDS TO LIGHTEN UP. PWAT INDICATES MOISTURE 
VALUES BETWEEN 1.75 AND 2.00 INCHES THROUGH THE PERIOD. WITH LIGHTER 
WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK SYNOPTIC FLOW...WILL SEE THE NORMAL 
SUMMER MESOSCALE PROCESSES TAKING PLACE...ALLOWING FOR ISLAND TCUS 
TO BUILD IN. 12 HOUR POPS ARE BETWEEN 30 AND 40 PERCENT...BUT WILL 
HOLD WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. 

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN 
PLACE NORTH OF THE KEYS...ALLOWING FOR A LIGHT TO GENTLE EASTERLY 
FLOW. ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND NORMAL MID AUGUST INSOLATION 
WILL ALLOW FOR TYPICAL MESOSCALE PROCESSES DURING THE 
DAY...JUSTIFYING LOW CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE PERIOD. A TROPICAL WAVE 
NEAR THE WINDWARD ISLANDS WILL APPROACH THE REGION ON MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY...POSSIBLE ENHANCING RAIN CHANCES. 12 HOUR RAIN CHANCES FOR 
THIS PERIOD ARE BETWEEN 40 AND 45 PERCENT. NO CHANGES TO THIS 
PORTION OF THE FORECAST.

&&

.MARINE...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE NOW 
SITUATED FROM NORTH OF THE BAHAMAS TO ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA WILL 
REMAIN IN PLACE. THIS WILL KEEP GENTLE TO MODERATE WINDS OVER THE 
WATERS UNTIL LOW PRESSURE OFF SOUTH CAROLINA MOVES OVER LAND AND 
BEGINS TO WEAKEN BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. UNLESS SIGNIFICANT 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM OCCURS...AM NOT ANTICIPATING GREATER THAN 
15 KNOTS OF WIND ON THE ATLANTIC WATERS THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER GEORGIA/ NORTH FLORIDA SHOULD CONTINUE 
TO MOVE INLAND...AS THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE MIGRATES TO OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA MOVES SOUTH AND WEAKENS. THIS WILL RESULT IN LIGHT TO 
GENTLE WINDS SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. STAY TUNED TO 
UPDATED MARINE INFORMATION FROM YOUR NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE HERE 
IN KEY WEST.

.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS WIDELY SEPARATED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
OVER THE OFFSHORE WATERS NORTH AND WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS. 
ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. 
WINDS OVER LAND ARE SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON 
AVERAGE...ARE SOUTHEAST NEAR 15 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS NEAR 20 KNOTS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 80S. ONLY ABOUT FIVE DEGREES OF WARMING 
IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER 
WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ACROSS 
CENTRAL FLORIDA TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE 
DEPICTS LESS THAN 50% RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES AS LOW AS 5 KFT TODAY 
AND TONIGHT. AS A RESULT...POPS WILL BE DECREASED FROM LOW CHANCE 
CATEGORY TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. NUMERICAL 
MODEL GUIDANCE DIFFERS AS TO HOW TO HANDLE THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
ABOUT 140 MILES EAST OF CHARLESTON...SOUTH CAROLINA. THE NAM 
NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE MOVES THIS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
SOUTHWESTWARD INTO EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA FRIDAY. THE NAM NUMERICAL 
MODEL GUIDANCE ALSO INDICATES A LOW LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE 
NEAR THE KEYS FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. IF THIS SCENARIO IS 
CORRECT...RAIN CHANCES FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY WOULD BE HIGHER THAN 
ADVERTISED...BUT THE NAM NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE SOLUTION SEEMS 
HIGHLY UNLIKELY...GIVEN THE ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
CENTRAL FLORIDA WOULD KEEP THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE EAST OF 
CHARLESTON FROM MOVING TO THE SOUTHWEST. THE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY 
PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE BASED 
UPON THE GFS AND UKMET NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE SOLUTIONS OF 
TRAPPING THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE EAST OF CHARLESTON IN A COL REGION 
AND WEAKENING IT. LOCALLY...THAT WOULD RESULT IN CLIMATOLOGICAL 
WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.   

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD BE LOCATED ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA SATURDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY NIGHT. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL 
GUIDANCE INDICATES PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES INCREASING ABOVE TWO 
INCHES MONDAY AND REMAINING ABOVE TWO INCHES MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY. THIS INCREASE IN MOISTURE MAY BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
TROPICAL WAVE CURRENTLY ALONG 44W SOUTH OF 20N. IF THIS SCENARIO IS 
CORRECT...RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHER THAN ADVERTISED FOR THE MONDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. 
IT IS JUST TOO EARLY TO SAY WITH ANY CERTAINTY IF THIS SCENARIO WILL 
PAN OUT. AS A RESULT...CONTINUITY WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE LONG

.DISCUSSION...
RADAR TRENDS OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS REVEAL A DECREASING TREND IN 
BOTH CONVECTIVE CELL COVERAGE AND INTENSITY...ALTHOUGH NUMEROUS 
REMNANT BOUNDARIES WERE EVIDENT ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...MOVING 
LITTLE. THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING INDICATED A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE STRATIFICATION...WITH MORE MOISTURE IN THE LOWER 
TROPOSPHERE THAN 24 HOURS AGO...BUT NOT AS UNSTABLE. ALTHOUGH THE 
SOUNDING SHOWED TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES IN EXCESS OF 2 
INCHES...GOES SOUNDER DATA INDICATE MUCH DRIER AIR ON OUR DOORSTEP 
OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA AND BAHAMIAN ISLES...MOVING SLOWLY 
TOWARD THE KEYS.

CONVECTIVE INHIBITION IS CURRENTLY WEAK...BUT MUCH DRIER AIR IN THE 
MID AND LOW TROPOSPHERE UPSTREAM WILL WORK INTO THE REGION 
OVERNIGHT...LIMITING CONVECTIVE RAIN CHANCES. THEREFORE...THE 
CURRENT FORECAST OF SLIGHT CHANCE OF MEASURABLE RAIN/ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS VERY REASONABLE FOR THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
330 PM EDT WED AUG 16 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK BUT SPRAWLING LOW PRESSURE CENTER 
(1013 MB) REMAINING OFF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST...WHILE YET ANOTHER 
WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREA IS OVER THE EAST CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. 
SHIP AND ISLAND REPORTS STILL VERIFY THAT A WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE IS 
POKING WEST OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS TO THE FLORIDA STRAITS. KEYS 
AREA WINDS AS OF 2 PM WERE STILL TENDING TO BE FROM A MORE SOUTHERLY 
DIRECTION AS OPPOSED TO SOUTHEAST WHICH MODELS HAS PROJECTED FOR 18Z 
(2 PM EDT). THIS APPARENTLY IS A RESULT OF THE GENERALIZED LOWER 
PRESSURES IN THE ATLANTIC AND GULF...AND ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA... 
WHICH HAS SO FAR KEPT THE RETURNING RIDGE FROM SHIFTING NORTH FROM 
THE KEYS. AND...LOCAL WIND SPEEDS REMAIN LIGHT...GENERALLY 5-10 KT 
AT ISLAND AND REEF SITES...BUT COULD BE HIGHER OUT IN THE STRAITS TO 
OUR SOUTH. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS THE WESTERN EDGE OF DRIER AIR 
ALOFT (WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER 1.4-1.5 INCH) HAVING CREPT WESTWARD 
TO THE EASTERN EDGE OF FLORIDA STRAITS...FROM CENTRAL CUBA TO THE 
CAY SAL BANK TO WATERS JUST WEST OF ANDROS ISLAND. CLUSTERS OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS STILL PERSIST OVER KEYS WATERS...BUT HAVE
TENDED TO DECREASE SOME IN COVERAGE THE PAST HOUR. 


.FORECAST...
TONIGHT...BOTH NAM AND GFS MODELS SHOW DRY AIR ALOFT MOVING WEST 
OVER THE KEYS AFTER 8 PM THIS EVENING...WITH RH VALUES OF 50 PCT OR 
LESS COMING DOWN TO LEVELS BELOW 5 THSD FT AGL. IN THE MEANTIME...
THE GFS SHOWS LINGERING DIVERGENCE OVERHEAD THROUGH TONIGHT...WITHIN 
THE AREA BETWEEN ONE HIGH LEVEL CYCLONE CENTERED JUST NORTH OF CUBA 
AND THE OTHER HIGH LEVEL CYCLONE OVER THE CENTRAL GULF. MODEL MOS 
OUTPUT HAS LOW CHANCES OF RAIN FOR TONIGHT AT 20 PCT...BUT THESE ARE 
FOR THE PERIOD AFTER 8 PM (00Z). DECREASING TREND OF SHOWERS ON 
RADAR AT 330 PM PROMPS GOING WITH 20 PCT POPS FOR ISLANDS AND 
ATLANTIC WATERS...30 PCT POPS FOR EVENING SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OVER 
BAY AND GULF WATERS DECREASING TO ISOLATED LATER ON. MODELS CONTINUE 
TO INSIST THAT THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL SHIFT NORTH OF THE KEYS A BIT 
OVERNIGHT...SO I WILL INDICATE WINDS TRANSITIONING FROM S TO 
SE...WITH A LITTLE INCREASE IN SPEED AS WELL. 

THURSDAY...VERY DRY AIR DOWN BELOW 5 THSD FT AGL IS SHOWN BY THE 
MODELS TO START THE DAY...BUT GFS SHOWS A RE-MOISTENING UP TO 850 MB 
(5 THSD FT AGL) DURING THE AFTERNOON. DRY AIR IS STILL IN PLACE 
ABOVE 850 MB THROUGH THE DAY. THE GFS MOS OUTPUT HAS ONLY 10 PCT 
CHANCE OF RAIN. I WILL HOLD ONTO CURRENT 30 PCT POPS...AS THERE IS 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EFFECTS OF THE ADDITIONAL MOISTURE IN THE 
AFTERNOON. THE NAM AND NGM MOS HAVE 30 PCT POPS FOR THU. LOWER POPS 
MAY BE IN ORDER, HOWEVER, IF THE SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS KEEP ENOUGH

330 PM EDT WED AUG 16 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK BUT SPRAWLING LOW PRESSURE CENTER 
(1013 MB) REMAINING OFF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST...WHILE YET ANOTHER 
WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREA IS OVER THE EAST CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. 
SHIP AND ISLAND REPORTS STILL VERIFY THAT A WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE IS 
POKING WEST OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS TO THE FLORIDA STRAITS. KEYS 
AREA WINDS AS OF 2 PM WERE STILL TENDING TO BE FROM A MORE SOUTHERLY 
DIRECTION AS OPPOSED TO SOUTHEAST WHICH MODELS HAS PROJECTED FOR 18Z 
(2 PM EDT). THIS APPARENTLY IS A RESULT OF THE GENERALIZED LOWER 
PRESSURES IN THE ATLANTIC AND GULF...AND ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA... 
WHICH HAS SO FAR KEPT THE RETURNING RIDGE FROM SHIFTING NORTH FROM 
THE KEYS. AND...LOCAL WIND SPEEDS REMAIN LIGHT...GENERALLY 5-10 KT 
AT ISLAND AND REEF SITES...BUT COULD BE HIGHER OUT IN THE STRAITS TO 
OUR SOUTH. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS THE WESTERN EDGE OF DRIER AIR 
ALOFT (WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER 1.4-1.5 INCH) HAVING CREPT WESTWARD 
TO THE EASTERN EDGE OF FLORIDA STRAITS...FROM CENTRAL CUBA TO THE 
CAY SAL BANK TO WATERS JUST WEST OF ANDROS ISLAND. CLUSTERS OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS STILL PERSIST OVER KEYS WATERS...BUT HAVE
TENDED TO DECREASE SOME IN COVERAGE THE PAST HOUR. 


.FORECAST...
TONIGHT...BOTH NAM AND GFS MODELS SHOW DRY AIR ALOFT MOVING WEST 
OVER THE KEYS AFTER 8 PM THIS EVENING...WITH RH VALUES OF 50 PCT OR 
LESS COMING DOWN TO LEVELS BELOW 5 THSD FT AGL. IN THE MEANTIME...
THE GFS SHOWS LINGERING DIVERGENCE OVERHEAD THROUGH TONIGHT...WITHIN 
THE AREA BETWEEN ONE HIGH LEVEL CYCLONE CENTERED JUST NORTH OF CUBA 
AND THE OTHER HIGH LEVEL CYCLONE OVER THE CENTRAL GULF. MODEL MOS 
OUTPUT HAS LOW CHANCES OF RAIN FOR TONIGHT AT 20 PCT...BUT THESE ARE 
FOR THE PERIOD AFTER 8 PM (00Z). WHAT I WILL DO IS INDICATE A HIGHER 
CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH EVENING...THEN LOWER CHANCE OVERNIGHT AS THE 
DRIER AIR ALOFT MOVES IN. MODELS CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT THE SURFACE 
RIDGE WILL SHIFT NORTH OF THE KEYS A BIT OVERNIGHT...SO I WILL 
INDICATE WINDS TRANSITIONING FROM S TO SE...WITH A LITTLE INCREASE 
IN SPEED AS WELL. 

THURSDAY...VERY DRY AIR DOWN BELOW 5 THSD FT AGL IS SHOWN BY THE 
MODELS TO START THE DAY...BUT GFS SHOWS A RE-MOISTENING UP TO 850 MB 
(5 THSD FT AGL) DURING THE AFTERNOON. DRY AIR IS STILL IN PLACE 
ABOVE 850 MB THROUGH THE DAY. THE GFS MOS OUTPUT HAS ONLY 10 PCT 
CHANCE OF RAIN. I WILL HOLD ONTO CURRENT 30 PCT POPS...AS THERE IS 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT EFFECTS OF THE ADDITIONAL MOISTURE IN THE 
AFTERNOON. THE NAM AND NGM MOS HAVE 30 PCT POPS FOR THU. LOWER POPS 
MAY BE IN ORDER, HOWEVER, IF THE SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS KEEP ENOUGH 
DRY AIR IN THE 850-700 MB LEVEL. IF THE SURFACE RIDGE INCHES 
NORTHWARD...SURFACE WINDS FROM THE SE SHOULD PREDOMINATE IN THE 
10-15 MPH RANGE. 

THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT WEDNESDAY...A MOIST LAYER UP TO 700 MB 
(SURFACE TO 10 THSD FT AGL) IS INDICATED THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH A 
GENERAL E TO SE FLOW THROUGH THAT LAYER. NO STRONG DISTURBANCES ARE 
SHOWN ALOFT OVER THE IMMEDIATE AREA. GFS MOS HAS 12-HOUR POPS

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE CENTER OFF THE SOUTH CAROLINA 
COAST WHICH IS WEAK (ABOUT 1013 MB) BUT HAS A RATHER LARGE, BROAD 
CIRCULATION. AN ASSOCIATED TROUGH EXTENDS FROM THE LOW CENTER TO 
THE GENERAL VICINITY OF SE FLORIDA...BUT THIS TROUGH HAS BECOME SO 
DIFFUSE IT IS HARD TO ANALYZE CLOSELY. AND...ANOTHER BROAD, LOW 
PRESSURE AREA IS OVER THE EAST CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO ACCORDING TO 
BUOY AND SHIP REPORTS. DESPITE ALL THE LOW PRESSURES AND DIFFUSE 
TROUGH TO OUR NORTH...A SATELLITE QUIKSCAT PASS THIS MORNING SHOWS A 
WIND PATTERN THAT VERIFIES THE EXPECTED RETURN OF A WEAK ATLANTIC 
SURFACE RIDGE WEST OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS TO THE FLORIDA STRAITS 
ADJACENT TO THE KEYS. WINDS OVER THE KEYS AND NEARBY WATERS ARE NOW 
MOSTLY SOUTH IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE...BUT A REPORT FROM THE VESSEL 
HORIZON CHALLENGER IN THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE STRAITS WELL SOUTH OF 
THE LOWER KEYS SHOWS SE WINDS 9 KT. THE LOCAL ATMOSPHERE REMAINS 
SLIGHTLY DISTURBED AND PLENTIFUL MOISTURE IS STILL IN PLACE 
(PRECIPITABLE WATER IS 1.85 INCH)...AND AS A RESULT SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE RANDOMLY PLACED OVER THE KEYS AND 
SURROUNDING WATERS. MOVEMENT OF SHOWERS IS SLOWLY TOWARD THE NORTH. 

.FORECAST...
NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES IS PLANNED. MOISTURE SHOULD STAY IN PLACE 
OVER THE KEYS THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY...SO 30 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN IS
STILL REASONABLE...AND SUGGESTED BY 06Z MODEL OUTPUT. A BIT DRIER 
AIR ALOFT SEEN OVER THE CENTRAL AND SE BAHAMAS OUGHT NOT TO ARRIVE 
IN THE KEYS UNTIL TONIGHT.
&&

.MARINE...
WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS STARTING TO BUILD SLIGHTLY WESTWARD 
OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS TOWARD THE KEYS. THIS SHOULD TURN AREA 
WINDS TO SE-S WITH AN INCREASE IN SPEEDS TO NEAR 10 KT DURING THE 
AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH 10-15 KT WINDS ARE POSSIBLE WELL OUT IN THE 
STRAITS. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE AROUND THROUGH 
MUCH OF THE DAY...PRODUCING LOCAL ERRATIC WINDS. WATCH FOR POSSIBLE 
SPOUTS...AND LIGHTNING TOO. 
&&

.AVIATION...
A LOW TO MID LEVEL TROUGH NEAR THE KEYS IN ASSOCIATION WITH LOW 
PRESSURE NORTHEAST OF THE BAHAMAS...WILL GRADUALLY MOVE NORTHWARD. A

WITH TIME BY LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS ON 
THE MAINLAND WILL INCREASE TO SCATTERED BY 16Z OR SO...WITH THE 
PRESENT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORM COVERAGE OVER THE WATERS AND THE 
KEYS ISLAND TERMINALS GRADUALLY DIMINISHING TO ISOLATED BY THIS 
AFTERNOON. SLOW MOVING SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL PRODUCE PERIODIC 
MVFR/IFR CIGS & VIS THIS MORNING...WITH ERRATIC MOVEMENT REQUIRING 
AMENDMENTS AS NECESSARY...BUT COVERAGE WILL BE SUCH THAT THESE CELLS 
WILL REMAIN CIRCUMNAVIGABLE IN THE AIR. WINDS AT THE KEYS ISLAND 
TERMINALS WILL BE LIGHT AND SOUTHERLY THIS MORNING...GRADUALLY 
BECOMING LIGHT AND SOUTHEASTERLY.

ONLY ABOUT SIX DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO LIGHT 
SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE IS LOCATED NEAR THE KEYS. THIS TROUGH OF 
LOW PRESSURE EXTENDS SOUTHWESTWARD FROM AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
LOCATED A FEW HUNDRED MILES SOUTHEAST OF THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST. 
THIS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE NORTHWARD TODAY...DRAGGING THE 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WITH IT. THIS WILL ALLOW AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE TO BEGIN BUILDING ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA THIS 
AFTERNOON. ALL NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATE DRIER AIR NEAR THE 
BAHAMAS PUSHING WESTWARD TOWARD THE KEYS TONIGHT. THE GFS NUMERICAL 
MODEL GUIDANCE DEPICTS LESS THAN 50% RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES AS LOW 
AS 5 KFT. AS A RESULT...POPS WILL BE DECREASED FROM LOW CHANCE 
CATEGORY TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY FOR TONIGHT. NUMERICAL MODEL 
GUIDANCE DIFFERS AS TO HOW LONG THIS DRIER AIR MASS WILL REMAIN NEAR

RATHER QUICKLY THURSDAY. MEANWHILE...THE NAM NUMERICAL MODEL 
GUIDANCE HANGS ON TO THE DRIER AIR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE MOSTLY CLOUDY IN THE LOWER KEYS THIS MORNING...CLEAR TO 
PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS. EARLY FRAMES OF VISIBLE 
SATELLITE SUGGESTED MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVER THE PENINSULA. GATEWAY 
WAS EXPERIENCING A DATA OUTAGE...BUT TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE LOWER 
OR MIDDLE 80S AT THE REPORTING STATIONS WITH VERY NEARLY FLAT CALM 
CONDITIONS. OUR RADAR SHOWED ONLY A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS IN OUR AREA 
OF CONCERN. THE MORNING SOUNDING HAD MOISTENED SINCE YESTERDAY 
MORNING WITH PW 2.2 INCHES. LIGHT NORTHWESTERLY SHEAR EXISTED 
THROUGH THE TROPOSPHERE AND INHIBITION WAS PRETTY MUCH ABSENT. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
WITH THE OUTAGE OUR ANALYSIS SUFFERED A BIT. WE DISCERNED A SURFACE 
LOW IN THE OPEN ATLANTIC WELL EAST OF ABOUT SAVANNAH...SOMEWHAT 
NORTH OF ITS PREVIOUS POSITION. RISING PRESSURES ON THE MAINLAND 
OVERNIGHT HAD RESULTED IN A WEAK RIDGE AXIS FROM NEAR PINE ISLAND TO 
THE MARQUESAS KEYS AND INTO THE STRAITS. A RECENT QUICK-SCAT PASS 
HELPED TO LOCATE THIS. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
BASED ON THE FOREGOING IT WOULD SEEM SAFE TO BEGIN LOWERING OUR RAIN 
CHANCES. HOWEVER WE FEEL EVEN SAFER TAKING A WAIT AND SEE ATTITUDE. 
BUOYANCY REMAINS STRONG AND SHEAR IS WEAK...WHICH IS THE FORMULA FOR 
ISLAND CLOUD LINES. CLEAR SKIES ON THE MAINLAND WILL ALLOW FULL 
SUNSHINE SO AFTERNOON STORMS ARE LIKELY THERE. MINIMAL SHEAR MEANS 
CONVECTIVE-SCALE INTERACTIONS WILL PREDOMINATE WHICH TYPICALLY SENDS 
CELLS TOWARD THE UPPER KEYS. WE WILL RE-EVALUATE AROUND NOON AND SEE 
HOW IT IS GOING. AS IT STANDS WE PLAN NO UPDATE.
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE LIGHT AGAIN TODAY. AND ONCE AGAIN IF YOU PLAN 
A TRIP TO THE REEF OFF KEY LARGO...OR FLORIDA BAY...REMAIN ALERT TO 
EVENTS ON THE MAINLAND. 
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THE 
SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND. WIND GUSTS OF AROUND 30 KNOTS ARE POSSIBLE 
WITH THE STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS. OTHERWISE...ALONG THE ISLAND 
CHAIN...CLOUD LINES APPEAR TO BE THE MAIN SOURCE FOR SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACTIVITY...WITH LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS EXPECTED AT

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED A HIGHLY UNSTABLE 
STRATIFICATION WITH MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATES NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE 6.0 
C/KM...AND MLCAPE OF 2064 J/KG. THE SUBCLOUD LAYER WAS VERY MOIST 
AND LITTLE CONVECTIVE INHIBITION WAS PRESENT. HOWEVER...DRY AIR WAS 
PRESENT IN THE 850-700MB LAYER WITH DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS AROUND 8C. 
IN ADDITION...WIND FLOW WAS VERY LIGHT THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE... 
WITH A MAXIMUM WIND OF ONLY 9KT AT 300MB. NUMEROUS OLD OUTFLOWS ARE 
EVIDENT ON DOPPLER RADAR SCANS. HOWEVER...THEY ARE MOVING SO SLOWLY 
THAT WHAT LITTLE CONVECTIVE INHIBITION EXISTS IS ENOUGH TO PREVENT 
ANY PARCEL FROM REACHING THE LEVEL OF FREE CONVECTION. HENCE...THE 
DEARTH OF PRECIPITATION ECHOES ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA PER RECENT 
RADAR SCANS. 

IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT HAPPENS OVERNIGHT BECAUSE 
NUMERICAL MODELS ARE SUGGESTING A SLIGHT STRENGTHENING OF THE 
LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC FLOW FROM THE SOUTHEAST AFTER 06Z...AND WITH THE 
CURRENT THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT...THIS MAY BE JUST THE MECHANISM 
NEEDED TO ENHANCE REMNANT BOUNDARIES AND INITIATE CONVECTION. THE 
CURRENT FORECAST...WITH 30 PERCENT 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES...COVERS THE 
SITUATION FINE GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY...ALTHOUGH THE BEST CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION AND MEASURABLE RAINFALL MAY VERY WELL BE LATER TOWARD 
DAYBREAK...OR PERHAPS DURING THE FIRST PART OF WEDNESDAY MORNING.
&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT AND VARIABLE BREEZES WILL BECOME SOUTHEAST 5-10KT OVERNIGHT... 
WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING MAINLY LATE.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL AFFECT THE ROUTE...PRODUCING LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS AND IFR 
VISIBILITIES IN STRONGER CELLS. SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL MOVE VERY 
LITTLE...SO ANY SUCH CONDITIONS COULD LAST A WHILE AT A GIVEN POINT. 
HOWEVER...SUCH CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. WINDS 
AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE...BECOMING EAST 
SOUTHEAST BY MORNING WITH SPEEDS 6 KT OR LESS.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES CLOUDED UP TODAY OVER THE ISLANDS AND MANY LOCATIONS RECEIVED 
SOME WELCOME RAIN. RADAR ESTIMATES RANGED AS HIGH AS TWO INCHES ON 
NORTH KEY LARGO. EVEN WITH THE CLOUDS AND SHOWERS OUR TEMPERATURES 
CLIMBED INTO THE LOWER 90S AT THE REPORTING STATIONS. WINDS HAVE 
BEEN LIGHT NORTHERLY OUTSIDE OF CONVECTIVE DISTURBANCES. A PEAK WIND 
OF 40 MILES AN HOUR WAS MEASURED AT MOLASSES REEF LIGHT IN A 
THUNDERSTORM OUTFLOW -- SEE LSRKEY. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE BAHAMAS LOW HAS INCREASED IN OUR TOTAL COLUMN MOISTURE TO 
GREATER THAN 2. LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE HAS BECOME CONCENTRATED ALONG 
A TROF LINE IN OUR VICINITY AND WHICH EXTENDS UP THE WEST COAST OF 
THE PENINSULA JUST OFF SHORE. UPPER-LEVEL DIVERGENCE IS BEING 
PROVIDED BY VORTICITY SPOKES ROTATING AT INTERVALS AROUND THE PARENT 
LOW AS WELL AS CLOUD-TOP DIVERGENCE IN THE MANY CB-COMPLEXES SEEN ON 
RADAR. IN ADDITION...DIRECT THERMAL FORCING IS GENERATING SHOWERS ON 
THE MAINLAND WHICH WILL MOVE WITH THE STEERING CURRENTS TOWARD THE 
UPPER AN MIDDLE KEYS.
&&

.FORECASTS...
THIS COMPLEX PATTERN IS IN FLUX. NEW CELLS ON THE MAINLAND WILL 
ENCROACH ON THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS UNTIL WELL AFTER DARK. A 
NOCTURNAL MAXIMUM IN SHOWER COVERAGE IS LIKELY IN THE GULF ALONG THE 
AXIS OF BEST LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE...WITH A STEADY FEED TOWARD THE 
LOWER KEYS. TAKEN TOGETHER THE DISTINCTION BETWEEN THE RAIN CHANCES 
IN THE UPPER...MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS IS TOO FINE FOR OUR PURPOSES 
AND WE HAVE REUNITED THE LAND ZONES AT 50 PERCENT FOR TONIGHT.

BY TOMORROW THE TREND SHOULD BE TOWARD A GRADUAL INCREASE IN STATIC 
STABILITY DUE TO WEAKENING OF THE PARENT LOW AND THE EFFICIENCY OF 
ANTECEDENT SHOWERS. THEREFORE WE HAVE CARRIED A 40 PERCENT CHANCE OF 
RAIN ON TUESDAY. 

GUIDANCE SUGGESTS THAT BY WEDNESDAY THE BAHAMAS LOW WILL BE MOVING 
AWAY GRADUALLY...OR WEAKENING AND FILLING AS UPPER SUPPORT FADES. 
THIS SHOULD ALLOW A RESUMPTION OF OUR FAMILIAR PATTERN OF THE 
ATLANTIC HIGH AND EASTERLY BREEZES. LATE IN THE WORK-WEEK WIND 
SPEEDS MAY INCREASE AS A MINOR WAVE REINFORCES THE TRADES. IN ANY 
CASE WE HAVE CARRIED FORWARD WITH TEMPERATURES AND RAIN CHANCES 
CLOSE TO THE CLIMATOLOGICAL AVERAGES OR NORMALS FOR THE SEASON OF 30 
PERCENT.
&&

.MARINE...
THE BOATING WILL NOT BE EXCELLENT THIS EVENING AND TUESDAY. SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS PACKING 30-KNOT SQUALLS WILL BE POSSIBLE 
THROUGHOUT OUR WATERS BOTH OCEAN SIDE AND BAY/GULF SIDE. IF YOU DO 
VENTURE OUT...BE SURE TO CHECK THE RADAR BEFORE YOU LEAVE THE DOCK. 
CONDITIONS WILL IMPROVE TUESDAY AND THEREAFTER AS THE TRADE WINDS 
RESUME. 
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL GENERATE MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS FOR THE BALANCE OF 
THIS AFTERNOON...AND INTO EARLY TONIGHT. THEREAFTER...VFR CONDITIONS 
WITH ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE ANTICIPATED. AT THE 
KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS...MOSTLY NORTHWEST WINDS OF 5 TO 10 
KNOTS EXCEPT VARIABLE WITH GUSTS NEAR 25 KNOTS IN POSSIBLE STRONGER 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE CLOUDY THIS MORNING OVER THE UPPER KEYS...PARTLY CLOUDY 
IN THE MIDDLE KEYS...MOSTLY CLEAR OVER THE LOWER KEYS. EARLY MORNING 
TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE MIDDLE 80S WITH LIGHT NORTHWEST WINDS. 
RADAR SHOWED A FEW CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS...MOSTLY IN THE GULF WATERS 
ALONG THE WEST COAST NORTH OF CAPE SABLE. MOVEMENT WAS TOWARD THE 
SOUTHEAST. OUR MORNING SOUNDING HAD MOISTENED OVER THE LAST 24 HOURS 
WITH PW 1.7 INCHES. THERE WAS EVIDENCE OF WEAK SUBSIDENCE IN THE 
LAYER CENTERED AT 850 MB...HOWEVER THIS REPRESENTED ONLY MINIMAL 
INHIBITION AFTER MODIFYING FOR HEATING. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
ON OUR MORNING MESO-PLOT WE ANALYZED A SURFACE LOW OVER LITTLE 
BAHAMA BANK. A TROF RAN FROM THIS FEATURE TO MIAMI BEACH AND CAPE 
SABLE. THIS HAD ABOUT OBLITERATED THE RIDGE AXIS IN THE STRAITS. THE 
CLOUDS IN THE UPPER KEYS AND THE SHOWERS IN THE GULF WERE ALIGNED 
WITH THE TROF AXIS...WHICH ALSO HAD BROUGHT ABOUT THE NORTHWEST 
BREEZES. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
ONSHORE FLOW WILL HELP MAINTAIN THE SHOWERS ALONG THE WEST COAST. 
ONCE THE EAST COAST SEA BREEZE GETS GOING MESO-SCALE INTERACTIONS 
SHOULD RESULT IN SCATTERED COVERAGE IN THE METRO. STEERING FROM THE 
NORTH SHOULD BRING THE RAIN MASS TOWARD THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS. 
THIS SUPPORTS THE BREAKUP OF OUR LAND ZONES AS WAS DONE BY THE 
OVERNIGHT SHIFT IN ORDER TO HIGHLIGHT THE GREATER CHANCES THERE. AS 
A RESULT WE PLAN NO UPDATE TO GRIDS AND TEXT AT THIS TIME.
&&

.MARINE...
IT LOOKS LIKE NORTHWEST BREEZES LESS THAN 10 KNOTS WILL PREVAIL 
TODAY. THE EXCEPTION MIGHT BE IN THE OUTERMOST STRAITS WHERE A 
TENDENCY TOWARD EASTERLY FLOW MAY LINGER. WE COULD USE A MARINE 
REPORT ABOUT 40 OR 50 MILES OUT IF YOU ARE GOING IN THAT DIRECTION. 
IF YOU ARE ON THE REEF OFF KEY LARGO...OR IN THE BAY...KEEP A 
WEATHER EYE TO THE NORTH.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE WITH 
ISOLATED SHOWERS THIS MORNING...WITH COVERAGE INCREASING LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THE 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. NORTHWEST TO NORTH WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS 
WILL BE COMMON AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS.

AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS LOCATED NEAR 30N AND 70W. A TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE EXTENDS SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA...JUST NORTH OF LAKE 
OKEECHOBEE...AND INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THIS TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL SAG SOUTHWARD TODAY. AS A RESULT...THE STEERING FLOW 
SHOULD BECOME NORTHWEST TO NORTH NEAR 10 KNOTS TODAY. THIS STEERING 
FLOW SHOULD PUSH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP OVER THE 
SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA INTO FLORIDA BAY AND NEAR THE MIDDLE AND 
UPPER KEYS LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING. THE ZONE FORECASTS 
FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE SPLIT TO INDICATE HIGHER POPS FOR THE 
UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. THE AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE NEAR 30N AND 70W SHOULD BEGIN TO MOVE NORTHWARD 
TUESDAY...DRAGGING THE TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WITH IT. HIGH PRESSURE 
SHOULD BEGIN TO BUILD ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA TUESDAY NIGHT AND

A FEW THUNDERSTORMS TRAVERSED PORTIONS OF THE UPPER KEYS AROUND 
SUNSET AND ARE NOW WEAKENING AS THEY MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH OVER THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT TO THE UPPER KEYS. RAIN-FREE CONDITIONS 
HAVE PREVAILED OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
SURROUNDING WATERS. THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED A SHALLOW 
ADIABATIC LAYER UP TO 1800FT AGL...WITH WEAK CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY 
1800-3400FT AGL. A 1600-FT THICK STABLE LAYER WAS PRESENT ABOVE WITH 
WEAKLY UNSTABLE LAPSE RATES FROM ABOUT 3400-18000FT AGL. THE AIR 
MASS WAS MUCH DRIER THAN AVERAGE BETWEEN 700-850MB. DEEP...BUT WEAK 
NORTHERLY FLOW PREVAILED FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 400MB...WITH 
STRONGER NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE.

THE MAXIMUM TEMPERATURE IN KEY WEST TODAY WAS 92F AT 221PM. THIS IS 
THE HIGHEST SO FAR THIS YEAR. CURRENTLY...IT IS STILL A WARM 83F IN 
KEY WEST...AND 85F IN MARATHON WITH DEWPOINTS AROUND 74F. WINDS HAVE 
GONE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AT MOST ISLAND PLATFORMS...WITH NORTH WINDS 
5KT OR LESS FROM PULASKI SHOAL TO SOMBRERO KEY...AND WEST OR

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE MOSTLY SUNNY TODAY IN THE ISLANDS. CLOUD LINES DEVELOPED 
BUT REMAINED NARROW WITH LITTLE COVERAGE. TEMPERATURES CLIMBED INTO 
THE LOWER 90S AT THE REPORTING STATIONS. LOCAL RADAR WAS FREE OF 
ECHOES. REGIONAL RADARS IN FLORIDA SHOWED SCATTERED SHOWERS ON THE 
PENINSULA AND A MORE CONCENTRATED AREA OF RAIN AND SHOWERS IN THE 
ATLANTIC EAST OF JACKSONVILLE. THE RAIN AND CLOUDS WERE DRIFTING 
SOUTH. WINDS WERE LIGHT AND VARIABLE LOCALLY WITH A TENDENCY TOWARD 
A GENERALLY NORTHERLY DIRECTION.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
OUR LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS SHOW THAT THE LOCAL ANTICYCLONE REMAINS 
INTACT. THE LACK OF DEVELOPMENT WITHIN OUR CLOUD LINES SHOWS THAT 
DRY AIR REMAINS IN PLACE ALOFT. THE CLOUDS AND SHOWERS FARTHER NORTH 
EXISTED ALONG A FRONTAL ZONE SLOWLY SAGGING SOUTH TOWARD SOUTH 
FLORIDA. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
GUIDANCE IS BECOMING MORE RELIABLE REGARDING THE CLOUDS AND SHOWERS 
TO OUR NORTH AND THIS COMPLEX FEATURE IS OUR MAIN CONCERN THIS 
FORECAST. FALLING PRESSURES IN THE ATLANTIC SHOULD LEAD TO LIGHT 
NORTH WINDS THROUGH A FAIRLY DEEP LAYER ON THE PENINSULA AND HERE IN 
THE ISLANDS. AS THE CLOUDS AND SHOWERS GRADUALLY MOVE IN OUR RAIN 
CHANCES WILL INCREASE BUT NOT DRAMATICALLY AS WE WILL REMAIN ON THE 
PERIPHERY OF THIS SYSTEM. EVENTS WILL BE DIFFERENT ON THE MAINLAND 
AND IF YOU PLAN A TRIP TO THE METRO BE SURE TO CHECK THE CONDITIONS 
BEFORE YOU GO. DOWN HERE WE EXPECT ONLY A TREND TOWARD MORE NORMAL 
OR CLIMATOLOGICALLY AVERAGE RAIN CHANCES. IN ANY CASE IT SEEMS 
UNUSUAL FOR A FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO PENETRATE THIS FAR SOUTH IN THE 
MIDDLE OF SUMMER. 
&&

.MARINE...
OUR GRADIENT WILL REMAIN WEAK FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS SO WINDS 
SHOULD BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE...TENDING TOWARD A WEST OR NORTHWEST 
DIRECTION BUT ONLY AROUND 5 KNOTS. LATER IN THE WEEK WHEN THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE RE-ESTABLISHES ITSELF WE CAN LOOK FOR A RETURN TO OUR 
FAMILIAR EASTERLIES. IF YOU PLAN A TRIP TO THE REEF OFF KEY LARGO 
TOMORROW YOU WILL WANT TO PAY ATTENTION TO ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT 
DEVELOP ON THE MAINLAND AS THE STEERING FLOW WILL SEND THEM YOUR 
WAY.
&&

.AVIATION...
OVER SOUTH FLORIDA...AN INCREASE IN SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD EVOLVE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WHILE 
THE ISLAND CHAIN EXPERIENCES ONLY THE POTENTIAL OF ISOLATED SHOWERS. 
HENCE...THE ROUTE FORECAST FROM KEYW TO KMIA WILL BE SPLIT...WHILE 
THE MARATHON AND KEY WEST TERMINALS SHOULD ANTICIPATE LIGHT AND 
VARIABLE WINDS.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS
SUNSHINE HAS BEEN ABUNDANT IN THE ISLANDS TODAY...AND TEMPERATURES 
CLIMBED TO AROUND 90 AT THE REPORTING STATIONS. WE COULD USE A 
BREEZE BUT WINDS HAVE BEEN LIGHT AND VARIABLE MAKING FOR A SULTRY 
DAY. RADAR WAS EMPTY OF ECHOES.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THE SURFACE HIGH LOCATED OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS CONTROLS 
OUR WEATHER. THIS PERSISTENT FEATURE IS BEING SUSTAINED BY 
SUBSIDENCE ALOFT WHICH MANIFESTS ITSELF IN HIGH HEIGHTS AT THE 
MANDATORY LEVELS AND MULTIPLE INVERSIONS ON OUR SOUNDING.
&&

.FORECASTS...
ALL THINGS CONSIDERED PERSISTENCE WILL BE THE BEST FORECAST FOR 
ANOTHER 48 HOURS. SO WE WILL BEGIN THE COMING WEEK WITH MORE LIGHT 
WINDS AND WARM TEMPERATURES WITH SLIGHT RAIN CHANCES. AFTER THAT WE 
MUST TRY TO INCORPORATE GUIDANCE INTO THE FORECAST...WHICH HAS BEEN 
INCONSISTENT FROM RUN TO RUN AND FROM MODEL TO MODEL. 

IT DOES SEEM THAT AN AREA OF CLOUDS AND SHOWERS OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
STATES WILL SAG SOUTH SLOWLY. THIS MAKES POSSIBLE THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
A BAROCLINIC LOW IN THE ATLANTIC SOMEWHERE EAST OF FLORIDA BY 
TUESDAY.  WE HAVE LITTLE CONFIDENCE IN THE DETAILS AT THIS TIME AND 
PREFER TO CONTINUE THE GRADUAL TREND IN OUR GRIDS AND TEXTS TOWARD 
CLIMATOLOGICAL RAIN CHANCES...WHILE MAINTAINING LIGHT WINDS AND 
NEAR-NORMAL TEMPERATURES. 
&&

.MARINE...
EXCELLENT BOATING CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT OUR WATERS FOR 
THE REST OF THE WEEKEND. IF YOU ARE PLANNING A PASSAGE NEXT WEEK YOU 
SHOULD CHECK THE FORECASTS FREQUENTLY AS CHANGES ARE LIKELY. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE...WITH

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS
FAIR SKIES PREVAILED OVER THE KEYS THIS MORNING. SATELLITE SHOWED A 
FEW CLOUDS IN OUR AREA...MOST PROMINENTLY A LINE OF CONGESTUS IN THE 
STRAITS WHICH REPRESENTED A CUBAN LAND BREEZE. RADAR SHOWED DIFFUSE 
ECHOES WITHIN THIS FEATURE. TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE MIDDLE 80S WITH 
LIGHT/VARIABLE WINDS. THE MORNING RAOB HAD CHANGED LITTLE FROM 
YESTERDAY WITH A STABLE LAYER AROUND 850 MB. THIS REPRESENTED THE 
TOP OF THE MIXED LAYER...ABOVE WHICH THE AIR WAS QUITE DRY. TOTAL 
COLUMN MOISTURE WAS UNCHANGED AT 1.5 INCHES.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
OUR MORNING MESO-PLOT SHOWED SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE NEARLY 
OVERHEAD...WITH AN AXIS RUNNING FROM ABOUT CAPE CORAL TO CAY SAL 
BANK. THIS WAS FOSTERING OFF SHORE WINDS ON THE PENINSULA...LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE WINDS IN THE UPPER KEYS...AND LIGHT SOUTHEASTERLIES IN 
THE LOWER KEYS AND IN THE STRAITS. THE SURFACE HIGH WAS OVERLAID BY 
RIDGING ALOFT WHICH WAS PROMOTING DESCENT...AS EVIDENCED IN THE 
SOUNDING. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
WITH THIS SET UP WE WILL HAVE A HARD TIME DEVELOPING ANY 
PRECIPITATING CLOUDS. MIXING WITH HEATING WILL BRING DOWN SOME OF 
THAT DRIER AIR ALOFT SO THAT WE SHOULD ACTUALLY SEE CLOUD COVER 
DECREASE THROUGH THE DAY. OUR GOING GRIDS AND TEXT ADEQUATELY 
DESCRIBE THIS BENIGN WEATHER.  WE PLAN NO UPDATE OF THE LAND 
ZONES...AND FEW IF ANY CHANGES IN THE UPCOMING ROUTINE ISSUANCE OF 
THE COASTAL ZONES.
&&

.MARINE...
THE BOATING WEATHER WILL BE EXCELLENT TODAY...FOR THE POWER BOATERS. 
SAILORS SHOULD PLAN ON DOING A LOT OF MOTORING. WITH THE LIGHT WINDS 
AND SEAS THERE SHOULD BE GOOD SUBSURFACE VISIBILITY ON THE 
REEF...WHERE THE ANNUAL CORAL SPAWN HAS JUST TAKEN PLACE.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE...WITH 
ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS PRODUCING BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS. EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST WINDS OF AROUND 5 KNOTS CAN BE ANTICIPATED AT THE KEY WEST 
AND MARATHON TERMINALS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AS OF 2 AM (06Z) THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE APPARENTLY STILL 
EXTENDED WEST OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHERN TIP OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...THEREBY GIVING E TO SE WINDS 5 KT AT KEYS MARINE WIND 
GAUGES. THE PLATFORM 50 MILES NNW OF KEY WEST HAD NEARLY CALM 
WINDS...WHICH AGAIN MAY INDICATE A WEAK BUT SEPARATE HIGH PRESSURE 
CELL OVER THE SE GULF WATERS. AWAY FROM THE RIDGE AXIS...A SHIP IN 
THE WESTERN STRAITS REPORTED EAST WINDS 12 KT. MEANWHILE...WATER 
VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER IMAGES SHOW DRY AIR ALOFT STILL IN PLACE OVER 
THE KEYS...AS WELL AS OVER AREAS WELL TO THE WEST AND EAST. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER IS ESTIMATED AT 1.4-1.5 INCHES OVER THE 
AREA...EXCEPT SOME CIRRUS LEVEL MOISTURE IS NOTED MOVING OVER THE 
UPPER KEYS. THE DRYNESS CONTINUES TO SQUELCH SIGNIFICANT SHOWER 
ACTIVITY...AND AT LEAST FOR THE MOMENT DOPPLER RADAR REMAINS 
PRECIPITATION FREE. FAR TO THE EAST...THE NEXT IN A RECENT SERIES OF 
LARGE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOWS IS NOW SPINNING JUST NORTH OF THE MONA 
PASSAGE. IT REMAINS WARM AND HUMID AT GROUND LEVEL OVER THE KEYS.


.FORECAST...
TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...A HIGH PRESSURE CENTER OR RIDGE ALOFT 
IS EXPECTED TO STAY OVER OR JUST WEST OF THE KEYS THROUGH SUNDAY... 
PRODUCING A REGION OF SUBSIDING AIR WITH ASSOCIATED DRYNESS ALOFT 
OVER THE KEYS. MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS MAINTAIN INDICATIONS OF 
DRIER THAN USUAL AIR IN LEVELS FROM 3 THSD FT AGL UP TO 10 THSD FT 
AGL. MEANWHILE...THE WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AT THE SURFACE SHOULD 
STAY OVER OR NEAR THE KEYS THROUGH SUNDAY AS WELL...KEEPING SURFACE 
WINDS LIGHT AND AT TIMES VARIABLE. LOW CHANCES OF RAIN WILL BE 
MAINTAINED IN THE FORECAST (10-20 PCT) FOR EACH PERIOD...AND ALL 
MODEL OUTPUTS AGREE WITH THESE LOWER THAN NORMAL CHANCES OF RAIN 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. ONE PROBLEM FOR SUNDAY NIGHT HOWEVER...IS THAT 
BOTH THE LATEST RUNS OF THE GFS AND NAM MODELS SHOW LOWER PRESSURE 
FORMING EAST OF FLORIDA WITH A SURFACE TROUGH TURNING KEYS WINDS TO 
A LIGHT BUT DECIDEDLY NORTHWEST FLOW. THERE MAY BE A TENDENCY FOR 
ANY LATE DAY CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHERN MAINLAND TO MOVE SE TOWARD 
THE UPPER KEYS SUNDAY EVENING. 

MONDAY...BEGINNING THIS PERIOD...THE VARIOUS MODELS HAVE BEEN 
INCONSISTENT BETWEEN THEMSELVES AS WELL AS INTERNALLY FROM 
RUN-TO-RUN. THERE ARE LARGE DISCREPANCIES IN EVOLUTION, MOVEMENT, 
AND BEHAVIOR OF THE LARGE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW CENTER NOW NORTH OF 
HISPANIOLA AS IT STARTS TO MOVE WEST TOWARD SOUTH FLORIDA. AT THIS 
TIME...AT LEAST THE GFS AND NAM AGREE THAT A RATHER STRONG UPPER 
LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH (500-200 MB) WILL DIVE S TO SW OVER FLORIDA 
AND TOWARD THE KEYS MONDAY...ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE LARGE UPPER 
LOW. AND THE MODELS SHOW A SURFACE TROUGH AS WELL SWINGING SOUTH TO 
THE KEYS...ALONG WITH A RETURN OF DEEPER MOISTURE. IF MODELS PERSIST 
WITH THIS...A HIGHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE IN 
ORDER...BUT CURRENT 30 PCT POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED (LATEST MODEL 
OUTPUT HAS 30-40 PCT FOR MONDAY). LASTLY...THE SURFACE WIND FORECAST 
MAY NEED ADJUSTING TO A NW TO N FLOW INSTEAD OF VARIABLE. 

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...MODELS DIVERGE WITH LOCATION AND 
STRENGTH OF SURFACE LOW PRESSURE EAST OF FLORIDA. BOTH NAM AND GFS 
MODELS SHOW A COMPLEX UPPER PATTERN IN THE REGION...WITH  
DOUBLE-BARREL UPPER LEVEL LOW CENTERS AROUND SOUTH FLORIDA. GFS 
MOVES THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE TO THE NE AND AWAY WEDNESDAY...BUT 
SHOWS A TROUGH DRAGGING SOUTH TO SOUTH FLORIDA. WINDS AND CHANCES OF 
RAIN WILL BE AFFECTED BY THESE PATTERNS. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...EXTENDED GFS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE 
ALOFT MOVING BACK OVER SOUTH FLORIDA THURSDAY THEN EXITING WEST OF 
THE AREA FRIDAY. 30 PCT POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE SHOULD KEEP KEYS AREA WINDS LIGHT 
(GENERALLY UNDER 10 KT) THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. E-SE DIRECTIONS MAY 
PREVAIL ON ATLANTIC WATERS TODAY...OTHERWISE A VARIABLE WIND PATTERN 
SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE LIGHT SPEEDS THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER, 
THERE IS SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT A LOW PRESSURE TROUGH DEVELOPING 
FROM THE ATLANTIC TO FLORIDA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...WHICH MAY
TURN LOCAL WINDS TO NW AND N NEAR 10 KT OR SO. THAT PATTERN MAY 
BRING ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO KEYS WATERS AS 
WELL...STARTING MONDAY. 
&&

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT

ON THE REEF SHOW WINDS E TO SE IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE...AND SO DOES 
LONG KEY ON THE BAY SIDE. THE USF PLATFORM ON GULF WATERS NNW OF KEY 
WEST HAS WINDS CLOSE TO CALM. THIS SUGGESTS A WEAK GULF HIGH 
PRESSURE CELL MAY HAVE SEPARATED FROM THE ATLANTIC RIDGE. DRY AIR 
ALOFT REMAINS IN CONTROL OVER THE REGION...AND RADAR HAS HAD NO 
PRECIP ECHOES SO FAR OVERNIGHT. THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING SHOWED 
PRECIPITABLE WATER OF 1.4 INCH...AND THIS VALUE IS CURRENTLY

SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR ALOFT IN A LARGE SWATH EXTENDING FROM THE EXTREME

CLOSER TO LAKE O. IR SATELLITE SHOWS BATCHES AND FIELDS OF 
LOW-TOPPED CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER THE KEYS AND STRAITS WATERS...BUT NOT 
MUCH CLOUD COVER OVER GULF WATERS AT THIS TIME. 

.FORECAST...
IN THE LARGER PICTURE...LATEST MODEL RUNS CONTINUE TO SHOW UNUSUALLY 
DRY AIR ALOFT OVER THE KEYS PERSISTING ON THROUGH NEXT THURSDAY... 
BUT I WILL HOLD OFF AT THIS TIME ON DECREASING ONGOING FORECASTS FOR 
CHANCES OF RAIN FROM MONDAY ONWARD. THIS IS BECAUSE MODELS STILL 
SHOW AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH FORMING OVER THE ATLANTIC EAST OF THE

RIDGE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS IS EXPECTED TO SLIP SOUTH OVER THE 
KEYS...GIVING A PERIOD OF LIGHT E-SE BREEZES TODAY BECOMING LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE BY THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 


TODAY AND TONIGHT...MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS MAINTAIN DRY AIR WITH 
PW CLOSE TO 1.4 INCH TODAY AND TONIGHT OVER THE KEYS. SURFACE WIND 
FLOW SHOULD BE LIGHT (10 MPH OR LESS AT THE ISLANDS) AND MAY GO 
CLOSER TO EAST LATE TODAY OVER THE LOWER KEYS. THIS NORMALLY WOULD
BE A BIT FAVORABLE FOR TCUS OR CBS...BUT WITH DRY AIR ALOFT, 
AFTERNOONG MIXING SHOULD HELP THWART BUILD-UPS. BASED ON DRYNESS OF 
AIR ALOFT AND MOS GUIDANCE...I WILL NOT MENTION THUNDER FOR ISLANDS, 
BAY AND GULF WATERS TODAY...KEEPING 10 PCT CHANCE OF THE ODD SHOWER. 
IF MIXING IS EFFICIENT ENOUGH...MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND NO SHOWERS 
MAY BE IN STORE FOR THE AFTERNOON. NOT MUCH CHANGE IS SHOWN FOR 
TONIGHT...BUT AT THIS TIME I WILL KEEP ONGOING FORECASTS UNCHANGED. 

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE AT UPPER LEVELS WILL 
REMAIN CENTERED NEAR THE KEYS THROUGH SATURDAY...THEN MOVE SLOWLY 
WEST SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT BUT WITH THE KEYS STILL UNDER A RIDGE 
ALOFT WHICH EXTENDS EAST FROM THE UPPER HIGH. A SUBSIDING 
AIRMASS...WITH LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES (50 TO 60 PCT)IN THE 
LAYER ROUGHLY 3 THSD FT UP TO ALMOST 10 THSD FT AGL...IS SHOWN TO 
PERSIST THROUGH THIS PERIOD. WE MAY NEED TO REMOVE MENTION OF 
THUNDER...AND KEEP POPS EVEN LOWER THAN THE CURRENTLY FORECASTED 
10-20 PCT FOR THESE PERIODS...BUT ILL MAINTAIN CONTINUITY FOR 
NOW...TO SEE IF  SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS ARE AS STRONG ABOUT THE 
DRYNESS ALOFT. THE SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD BE OVER THE KEYS...(AND IT 
MAY SPLIT INTO A COL REGION)...GIVING A LIGHT AND VARIABLE WIND 
FLOW. 

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...AS MENTIONED ABOVE...THE UPPER LEVEL HIGH 
CENTER SHOULD HAVE MOVED WELL WEST AND NORTHWEST...AND AN UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH IS SEEN IN EXTENDED MODELS TO FORM EAST OF THE BAHAMAS. 
IN BETWEEN...AN UPPER LEVEL GENERAL FLOW FROM THE NORTH SETS IN OVER 
FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. THE GFS SUGGESTS POSSIBLE SHORT WAVE TROUGHS 
ALOFT MOVING SOUTH TOWARD THE KEYS DURING THIS PERIOD. SO DESPITE 
THE MODEL FORECAST OF CONTINUED DRY AIR AROUND THE 850 MB LEVEL...I 
WILL NOT ALTER ONGOING 30 PCT 12-HOUR CHANCES OF RAIN FOR THIS TIME 
FRAME. THE SURFACE RIDGE MAY SHIFT NORTH A BIT BY THU AND FRI... 
RETURNING AREA WINDS TO AN E-SE FLOW.

.MARINE...
A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS SHOULD GIVE E-SE 
WINDS 5-10 KT TO THE KEYS NEARSHORE WATERS TODAY AND TONIGHT...
A BIT HIGHER NEAR 10 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS...MAINLY SE 5-10 KT FOR 
BAY AND GULF. THOSE GULF WATERS MAY GO VARIABLE LATE TODAY AND 
TONIGHT AS A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE CELL PINCHES OFF IN THAT AREA. 
THEN....A SPELL OF LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS ALONG WITH SLIGHT SEAS 
APPEARS IN STORE FOR MOST KEYS WATERS SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
AS THE WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AREA SETTLES DIRECTLY OVER THE KEYS.

BAHAMAS...WITH THE UPPER RIDGE AND UPPER HIGH CENTER NOW OVER 
FLORIDA MOVING WEST...LEADING TO A PERIOD OF POSSIBLE SHORT WAVE 
TROUGHS ALOFT MOVING SOUTH OVER FLORIDA AND TOWARD THE KEYS MONDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK. IN THE MEANTIME...THE WEAK SURFACE 
RIDGE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS IS EXPECTED TO SLIP SOUTH OVER THE 
KEYS...GIVING A PERIOD OF LIGHT E-SE BREEZES TODAY BECOMING LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE BY THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 


TODAY AND TONIGHT...MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS MAINTAIN DRY AIR WITH 
PW CLOSE TO 1.4 INCH TODAY AND TONIGHT OVER THE KEYS. SURFACE WIND 
FLOW SHOULD BE LIGHT (10 MPH OR LESS AT THE ISLANDS) AND MAY GO 
CLOSER TO EAST LATE TODAY OVER THE LOWER KEYS. THIS NORMALLY WOULD
BE A BIT FAVORABLE FOR TCUS OR CBC...BUT WITH DRY AIR ALOFT, THEN 
 MIXING SHOULD HELP THWART BUILD-UPS. BASED ON DRYNESS OF AIR ALOFT
AND MOS GUIDANCE...I WILL NOT MENTION THUNDER FOR ISLANDS, BAY AND 
GULF WATERS...KEEPING 10 PCT CHANCE OF THE ODD SHOWER. IF MIXING IS 
EFFICIENT ENOUGH...MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND NO SHOWERS MAY BE IN STORE 
FOR THE AFTERNOON. NOT MUCH CHANGE IS SHOWN FOR TONIGHT...BUT AT 
THIS TIME I WILL KEEP ONGOING FORECASTS UNCHANGED. 

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE AT UPPER LEVELS WILL
REMAIN CENTERED NEAR THE KEYS THROUGH SATURDAY...THEN MOVE SLOWLY WEST
SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT BUT WITH THE KEYS STILL UNDER A RIDGE ALOFT 
WHICH EXTENDS EAST FROM THE UPPER KEYS. A SUBSIDING AIRMASS...WITH 
LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES (50 TO 60 PCT)IN THE LAYER ROUGHLY 3 
THSD TO ALMOST 10 THSD FT AGL...IS SHOWN TO PERSIST THROUGH THIS 
PERIOD. WE MAY NEED TO REMOVE MENTION OF THUNDER...AND KEEP POPS 
EVEN LOWER THAN THE CURRENTLY FORECASTED 10-20 PCT FOR THESE 
PERIODS...BUT ILL MAINTAIN CONTINUITY FOR NOW...TO SEE IF  
SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS ARE AS STRONG ABOUT THE DRYNESS ALOFT. THE 
SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD BE OVER THE KEYS...(AND IT MAY SPLIT INTO A COL 
REGION)...GIVING A LIGHT AND VARIABLE WIND FLOW. 

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...AS MENTIONED ABOVE...THE UPPER LEVEL HIGH 
CENTER SHOULD HAVE MOVED WELL WEST AND NORTHWEST...AND UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH IS SEEN IN EXTENDED MODELS TO FORM EAST OF THE BAHAMAS...
AND IN BETWEEN AN UPPER LEVEL GENERAL FLOW FROM THE NORTH SETS IN 
OVER FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. THE GFS SUGGESTS POSSIBLE SHORT WAVE 
TROUGHS ALOFT MOVING SOUTH TOWARD THE KEYS DURING THIS PERIOD. SO 
DESPITE THE MODEL FORECAST OF CONTINUED DRY AIR AROUND THE 850 MB 
LEVEL...I WILL NOT ALTER ONGOING 30 PCT 12-HOUR CHANCES OF RAIN FOR 
THIS TIME FRAME. THE SURFACE RIDGE MAY SHIFT NORTH A BIT BY THU AND 
FRI...RETURNING AREA WINDS TO AN E-SE FLOW.

.MARINE...
A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS SHOULD GIVE E-SE 
WINDS 5-10 KT TO THE KEYS NEARSHORE WATERS TODAY AND TONIGHT...
A BIT HIGHER NEAR 10 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS...MAINLY SE 5-10 KT FOR 
BAY AND GULF. THOSE GULF WATERS MAY GO VARIABLE LATE TODAY AND 
TONIGHT AS A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE CELL PINCHES OFF IN THAT AREA. 
THEN....A SPELL OF LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS ALONG WITH SLIGHT SEAS 
APPEARS IN STORE FOR MOST KEYS WATERS SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
AS THE WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AREA SETTLES DIRECTLY OVER THE KEYS.

WEAK SURFACE RIDGE HAS NOSED IN JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON. SKIES HAVE REMAINED MOSTLY SUNNY WITH TEMPERATURES HAVING 
REACHED AT LEAST 90F AT MARATHON AND 88F AT KEY WEST AS OF 300 PM. 
WINDS HAVE SETTLED IN OUT OF THE EAST-SOUTHEAST WITH SPEEDS 5 TO 7 
KNOTS. EARLIER SHOWERS 20 NM WEST SOUTHWEST OF CHOKOLOSKEE HAVE 
DISSIPATED...WITH THE KBYX RADAR ONLY INDICATING PATCHY 
STRATOCUMULUS OVER THE STRAITS. THE GEIGER KEY IPW OBSERVATIONS SHOW 
COLUMN PRECIPITABLE WATER DIPPED TO 1.4 INCHES. GOES SOUNDER 
INDICATED LARGE SWATH OF 1.5 INCH PW ACROSS THE KEYS THROUGH THE 
BAHAMAS...WITH HIGHER VALUES NEAR 1.75 INCHES IN THE SOUTHEAST GULF.

FORECAST...
AN UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW ACROSS THE WESTERN GULF WILL CONTINUE TO 
MOVE WEST...ALLOWING A LARGE MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN U.S. TO SPILL SOUTHEAST ACROSS FLORIDA. THIS BODES WELL FOR 
OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES RIGHT ON THROUGH THE WEEKEND...PROVIDED ADEQUATE 
SUNSCREEN IS AVAILABLE. SURFACE RIDGE FRACTURED EARLIER TODAY WITH A 
CELL IN THE NORTHEAST GULF AND WEST ATLANTIC RIDGE ACROSS EXTREME 
SOUTH FLORIDA. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPED IN THE LOW LEVEL COL 
REGION NORTHWEST OF CHOKOLOSKEE AS NORTHERLY FLOW AROUND THE GULF 
HIGH MET THE SOUTHEAST FLOW FROM THE ATLANTIC RIDGE. GENERAL 
SYNOPTIC SCALE SUBSIDENCE AND AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS THAT 
PRECIPITABLE WATER MAY REMAIN BELOW 1.5 INCHES THROUGH 
SATURDAY...AND LACK OF ANY LARGE-SCALE FORCING MECHANISMS LED ME TO 
REDUCE POPS DOWN TO 10 PERCENT. FORECAST SOUNDINGS FROM THE NAM AND 
GFS INDICATE SOME INSTABILITY WILL REMAIN THROUGH FRIDAY...BUT 
OTHERWISE IT SHOULD BE DIFFICULT FOR THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP AT ALL 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AS LIFTED INDICES REMAIN ABOVE ZERO. THE 
LOW LEVEL RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN OVER EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA 
INTO THE WEEKEND WITH WINDS LIGHT FROM THE EAST OR SOUTHEAST. 

MOISTURE GRADUALLY RECOVERS SUNDAY AND MONDAY. GFS/UKMET INDICATE 
STRONG ENERGY DIVING THROUGH THE MID-ATLANTIC IN THE MEDIUM 
RANGE...AND GFS SOLUTION HAS BEEN CONSISTENT IN DROPPING A COLD 
FRONT THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST STATES AND INTO THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. 
STILL...UKMET AND GFS MAINTAIN A NARROW LOW LEVEL RIDGE OVER OR JUST 
NORTH OF THE KEYS. EXPECT CONTINUED EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW WHICH MAY 
GO VARIABLE AT TIMES. STILL AM COUNTING ON THE GFS BEING TOO 
AGGRESSIVE SINKING THE FRONTAL REMNANTS INTO THE KEYS...BUT RATHER

A VERY WEAK CONVERGENT AREA HAS INITIATED A COUPLE OF SHOWERS ON THE 
NORTHERN EXTREME OF OUR GULF WATERS EARLY THIS MORNING. 
OTHERWISE...EARLY MORNING IR SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE JUST A FEW 
CLOUDS NEAR THE ISLAND CHAIN AND OFF IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS. A 
LARGER AREA OF MID LEVEL CLOUDS IS THINNING AT IT DRIFTS AWAY FROM 
THE NORTHERN CUBAN COAST. GENTLE TO OCCASIONALLY MODERATE BREEZES 
ARE FROM THE EAST TO SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA WITH
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 80S EARLY THIS MORNING.

.FORECAST...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO SETTLE INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WITH 
A WEAK BUT PERSISTENT RIDGE AXIS ALIGNED ACROSS THE IMMEDIATE AREA 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH THIS WEEKEND...AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. A DRY 
AIRMASS IN ASSOCIATION WITH RIDGING THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE WILL ACCOUNT FOR A BELOW NORMAL RAIN 
CHANCES TODAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE LATEST MODEL OUTPUT 
STATISTICS ARE MEAGER AS FAR AS RAIN CHANCES ARE 
CONCERNED...ESPECIALLY THE GFS WHICH IS SINGLE DIGITS THROUGH 
SATURDAY. HOWEVER...AS KBYX RADAR HAS SHOWN OVER THE PAST FEW 
HOURS...EVEN A VERY WEAK AREA OF LOW LEVEL FORCING IS ENOUGH TO PUSH 
OUT A COUPLE SHOWERS...SO WILL KEEP A 20 POP IN THE GRIDS THROUGH 
SATURDAY. THE GFS CONTINUES TO INDICATE A WEAKENING FRONT/TROUGH 
SLIDING DOWN THE STATE EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH SOME DEVELOPMENT NORTH 
AND EAST OF THE BAHAMAS BY MID/WEEK...WHICH COULD SPELL MORE 
UNSETTLED CONDITIONS LOCALLY. THERE IS NO CONVINCING CONSISTENT 
EVIDENCE TO CHANGE OUR CURRENT FORECAST FOR THOSE EXTENDED PERIODS 
THOUGH. 30 PERCENT POPS STILL LOOKS GOOD THEN. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
BE A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE NORMAL FOR ALL PERIODS WELL INTO NEXT WEEK.

TROPICAL WAVE AXIS HAS PASS THROUGH DRY TORTUGAS AND IS HEADED 
WEST...WHILE UPPER LEVEL LOW IS SPINNING IN THE CENTRAL GULF.  
DESPITE HIGH MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY...ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE 
PRESENT ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS.  THIS LACK OF 
CONVECTION IS DUE TO WEEK UPPER LEVEL CONVERGENCE THAT IS 
SUPPRESSING CONVECTION.  SURFACE WINDS HAVE BEEN EAST SOUTHEAST AT 
10 TO 15 KNOTS ACROSS THE WATER...AND NEAR 10 KNOTS ON LAND...THANKS 
TO A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA THAT IS SLIDING 
SOUTHWARD AND REDUCING THE PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE KEYS. 

.FORECAST...
AS THE WAVE HEADS WEST AND THE RIDGE HEADS SOUTH...WINDS WILL 
DECREASE JUST A BIT.  MODELS BRING THE RIDGE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA BY 
FRIDAY...AND INDICATE IT WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY A SUBSIDENCE 
INDUCING RIDGE ALOFT.  THIS WILL DRAMATICALLY CUT RAIN CHANCES FOR 
THE WEEKEND.  BY MONDAY...THE MODELS GET MORE CONFUSED WITH RIPPLES 
IN THE EASTERLY FLOW AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT...INDICATING A 
SLIGHTLY MORE UNSETTLED PATTERN.  WILL DROP POPS TO 20 THROUGH 
SUNDAY AND THEN KEEP THEM AT 30 FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PACKAGE. OF 
SOME INTEREST IS THE GFS SOLUTION OF DRIVING A MID LATITUDE TROF 
INTO FLORIDA LATE NEXT WEEK.  THIS WOULD BE VERY UNUSUAL THIS TIME 
OF YEAR...SO WILL NOT BITE ON THE SOUTHERLY AND THEN WESTERLY WINDS 
THE GFS IS PROGGING INTO THE AREA.

CONCERNING THE...
...KEYW TERMINAL FORECAST...
PREVAILING VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH TONIGHT. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED...AND MAY UPDATE THE TERMINAL FORECAST TO

DEVELOP. BEST TIME FOR SHRA OR POSSIBLE +TSRA AT KEYW WILL BE 
BETWEEN 19-21Z. SURFACE WINDS MAY GUST 140/25KT IN SHOWERS THIS 
AFTERNOON...THEN RETURN TO 090-110 DEGREES NEAR 10 KT BY EVENING.

VICINITY SHOWERS ALREADY INDICATED THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS A CLOUD 
BOUNDARY MOVES ACROSS THE FLIGHT OPS AREA. OTHERWISE PREVAILING VFR 
EXPECTED THROUGH TONIGHT WITH SURFACE WINDS OUT OF 080-110 DEGREES 
8-10 KT.
...KMIA TO KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...
COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS BEEN SLOW TO INCREASE ON 
THE MAINLAND WHILE COVERAGE HAS BEEN BETTER THAN JUST ISOLATED 
ACROSS THE KEYS AND COASTAL WATERS. CURRENT THOUGHTS ARE TO INDICATE 
PREVAILING VFR WEATHER ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE WITH WIDELY

SOUNDER PWAT SHOWS LARGE SWATH OF HIGH PWAT ACROSS THE FCST

TODAY...AND HIGH RAIN CHANCES.  HOWEVER...NEARLY CLEAR SKIES SEEM TO 
INDICATE THAT MODELS ARE MISSING SOMETHING THAT IS SUPPRESSING 
CONVECTION.  GIVEN THE CONFLICTS BETWEEN MODELS AND WHAT IS ACTUALLY 
HAPPENING...CURRENT 50 POP SEEMS GOOD.  WILL TAKE DOWN SCEC...GIVEN 
WINDS ALREADY BELOW CRITERIA AND EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE.  


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
MODELS CONTINUE TO MOVE THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WESTWARD THROUGH THE 
GULF OF MEXICO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...ALLOWING DEEP RIDGING 
TO BECOME ESTABLISHED OVER THE LOCAL AREA. IN THE SHORT TERM...THE 
SURFACE WAVE WILL SLOWLY EXIT THE LOCAL AREA TO THE WEST AND LOSE 
ITS INFLUENCE. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM ARE INDICATING AN AXIS OF DEEPER 
MOISTURE LAGGING BEHIND IN A NE/SW ORIENTATION ACROSS THE EXTREME 
SOUTHERN TIP OF THE MAINLAND AND OVER THE ISLANDS THROUGH LATE THIS 
EVENING...AND THEN DRIER AIR BEGINS TO WORK IN FROM THE 
EAST/SOUTHEAST. WILL GIVE MORE CREDIT TO THIS SCENARIO DUE TO RECENT 
GOES SOUNDER AND WATER VAPOR IMAGES. WILL UP THE POPS AN ADDITIONAL 
10 PERCENT FOR TODAY...BUT WILL HOLD OFF ON GOING LIKELY EVEN WITH 
DECENT RADAR COVERAGE EXPECTED THROUGH THE MORNING CLOSE TO THE 
ISLANDS AND OUT OVER THE STRAITS. THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WEAKENS 
AS IT BECOMES CENTERED OUT IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC THROUGH 
THURSDAY...BUT ITS AXIS BECOMES BETTER ALIGNED ACROSS THE KEYS.
THANKS TO THE DRIER AIR AND OVERALL DEEPER RIDGING...THE FORECAST 
TREND OF DECREASED RAIN CHANCES LOOKS FINE FROM TONIGHT THROUGH THE 
DURATION OF THE FORECAST. ALTHOUGH MOST OF THE LATEST MOS POPS ARE 
BELOW CLIMO BEGINNING THURSDAY AFTERNOON INTO THIS WEEKEND...WILL 
KEEP OUR CHANCES RIGHT ABOUT 30 PERCENT FOR THE DURATION OF THE 
FORECAST. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE AVERAGE ALL 
PERIODS.

&&

.MARINE...
WITH WINDS ALREADY RUNNING BELOW SCEC CRITERIA...WILL REMOVE THE 
ADVISORY.  OTHERWISE...CURRENT IDEA OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS LOOKS REASONABLE FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.  HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE CURRENTLY OVER NORTHERN FLORIDA WILL SLIDE SOUTHWARD TOMORROW 
AND BE OVER SOUTHERN FLORIDA FOR THE WEEKEND...CAUSING WINDS TO DROP 
TO AROUND 10 KNOTS OR LOWER.  

&&

.AVIATION...
CONCERNING THE...
...KEYW TERMINAL FORECAST...
TEMPO MVFR VIS/CIGS FOR SHRA WAS INCLUDED THROUGH 14Z TO ACCOUNT FOR 
NARROW BAND OF SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH THE FLIGHT OPS AREA. EXPECT 
THESE SHOWERS TO DECREASE AFTER 15Z WITH PREVAILING VFR FLIGHT 
CONDITIONS INTO THIS EVENING. SURFACE WINDS TO RETURN FROM 090-110 
DEGREES 8 TO 10 KT.
...KMTH TERMINAL FORECAST...
NOT MUCH IF ANY CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY NEAR THE KMTH TERMINAL THIS 
MORNING AND PREVAILING VFR TERMINAL FORECAST WAS MAINTAINED THROUGH 
THIS EVENING. SURFACE WINDS EXPECTED TO REMAIN FROM 090-110 DEGREES 
8 TO 10 KT.
...KMIA TO KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...
ONLY ISOLD IFR VIS/CIGS IN +TSRA EXPECTED ALONG THE KEYS AND 
ADJACENT WATERS TODAY. OVER THE EVERGLADES AND METRO MIAMI PORTION 
OF THE ROUTE...EXPECT SCT MVFR VIS/CIGS IN SHOWERS AND ISOLD IFR IN 
+TSRA BY 15-16Z. A FEW +TSRA MAY PRODUCE SURFACE WIND GUSTS UP TO 30 
KT.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR HAVE LINGERED NEAR THE MIDDLE TO LOWER KEYS 
THIS MORNING...AND HAVE CONTINUED TO SPREAD WESTWARD TO THE WATERS 
ADJACENT TO THE LOWER KEYS. SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE ALSO FLARED 
FURTHER OUT IN THE STRAITS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. EARLY MORNING 
WATER VAPOR IMAGES SHOW THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER EXTREME 
SOUTHWESTERN FLORIDA MOVING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK WAVE EXTENDING SOUTH FROM THE FLORIDA STRAITS 
INTO THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN.

.FORECAST...
MODELS CONTINUE TO MOVE THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WESTWARD THROUGH THE 
GULF OF MEXICO OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...ALLOWING DEEP RIDGING 
TO BECOME ESTABLISHED OVER THE LOCAL AREA. IN THE SHORT TERM...THE

.MARINE...
SHOWERS WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS HAVE KEPT THE CMAN OBS DISTURBED 
SINCE LATE LAST EVENING...HOWEVER A SLIGHT DECREASE IN GRADIENT 
WINDS CAN BE DISCERNED AS WINDS VEERED SLIGHTLY EARLY THIS MORNING. 
WILL GO AHEAD AND ALLOW THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY TO EXPIRE IN THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS ON THE EARLY MORNING MARINE ISSUANCE...BUT KEEP AN 
EXERCISE CAUTION FOR THOSE ZONES. BUT BOATERS SHOULD EXPECT A FAIR 
AMOUNT OF SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORMS ACTIVITY KEEPING LOCALIZED GUSTY 
WINDS AND HIGHER SEAS POSSIBLE THROUGH THIS MORNING AND EARLY 
AFTERNOON. NO CAUTIONARY OR ADVISORY HEADLINES ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT 
THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE FORECAST FOR ANY MARINE AREA.

&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP 
THIS MORNING ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE. ISLAND 
TERMINALS ARE EXPECTED TO BE OCCASIONALLY AFFECTED BY THESE SHOWERS 
AND STORMS. LATER THIS AFTERNOON...MOST OF THE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE 
CONCENTRATED OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AS SEABREEZES INITIATE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. WINDS UNDISTURBED BY CONVECTION OR DIURNAL WINDS WILL 
GENERALLY BE EASTERLY AT AROUND 10 KNOTS. STRONG SHOWERS AND

.CURRENTLY...
AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW...ACCOMPANIED BY A MID-LEVEL TROUGH AND WEAK 
SURFACE WAVE...IS MOVING WESTWARD OVER THE WESTERN BAHAMAS AND 
SOUTHERN TIP OF FLORIDA. AS A RESULT...WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE MOVING INTO THE AREA FROM THE EAST...ALONG AND 
EAST OF THE AXIS OF THE LOW TO MID-LEVEL TROUGH. WINDS ALONG THE 
ISLANDS ARE MAINLY EAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. CMANS INDICATE WINDS 10 TO 
15 KT ON THE BAY AND GULF WATERS AND NEAR 15 KT ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE.


.FORECAST...

TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...
AS THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW AND LOW-LEVEL WAVE PASS THROUGH THE AREA 
TONIGHT...WINDS WILL TURN TOWARD SOUTHEAST AND NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE AREA. HAVE MAINTAINED 40 POPS 
WEDNESDAY IN THE BELIEF THAT THE SYSTEM SHOULD BE THROUGH THE KEYS 
BY MORNING. BOTH THE GFS AND SATELLITE TRACKING INDICATE THAT ITS 
FORWARD SPEED IS SUFFICIENT TO CLEAR THE KEYS BY NOON WEDNESDAY AT 
THE LATEST. IF THE SYSTEM SLOWS...POPS MAY HAVE TO BE INCREASED FOR 
TOMORROW.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT TUESDAY...
THE ATLANTIC RIDGE THAT HAS STRETCHED OVER NORTHERN FLORIDA/SOUTHERN 
GEORGIA FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS WILL BE WEAKENED BY THE PASSAGE 
OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND RETREAT INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. 
THIS WILL CAUSE WINDS ACROSS OUR AREA TO LIGHTEN AND BECOME EAST 
SOUTHEAST TO SOUTHEAST. BY LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE RIDGE WILL 
REBUILD ACROSS FLORIDA BUT FURTHER SOUTH AND NEARER TO THE KEYS. IT 
WILL REMAIN THERE INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...RESULTING IN A FAIR WEATHER 
PATTERN WITH LIGHT TO MODERATE BREEZES AND NEAR CLIMO POPS FOR THE 
KEYS.

&&

.MARINE...
WINDS HAVE DIED DOWN SINCE LAST NIGHT...AND HAVE BEEN NEAR 15 KT ON 
THE ATLANTIC SINCE THIS MORNING. SEAS HAVE SUBSIDED TO BELOW 6 
FT...THUS THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL BE ALLOWED TO EXPIRE AND 
WINDS AND SEAS ARE LOW ENOUGH THAT A SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION 
HEADLINE WILL NOT BE REQUIRED. HOWEVER...GUSTY WINDS IN WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE LOCALLY ROUGH SEAS ON ALL 
KEYS WATERS OVERNIGHT.

AS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE RETREATS IN WAKE OF THE PASSAGE OF THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM...WINDS WILL LIGHTEN OVER KEYS WATERS AND REMAIN 
LIGHT TO MODERATE INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. NO FURTHER CAUTIONARY 
HEADLINES ARE ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME.

AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN 
GEORGIA...AND HAS MOVED LITTLE IN THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS. PRESSURES 
ALONG THE RIDGE AXIS ARE ABOUT 1021 MB...DOWN 2 MB IN THE LAST 24 
HOURS...INDICATING THAT THE RIDGE HAS WEAKENED A BIT. HOWEVER...A 
TROPICAL WAVE APPROACHING OUR AREA FROM THE SOUTHERN BAHAMAS HAS 
KEPT THE GRADIENT REASONABLY TIGHT...AND WINDS ARE CLOSE TO 
YESTERDAY MORNINGS LEVELS. 12Z KEYW RAOB MEASURED WINDS 105 AT 16 
AND 17 KT AT 1 AND 2 KFT AGL. WINDS ALONG THE ISLANDS ARE RUNNING 
EAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. CMAN STATIONS SHOW EAST WINDS AROUND 15 KT AND 
GUSTY ON THE BAY AND GULF WATERS AND 15 TO 20 KT AND GUSTY ON THE 
ATLANTIC SIDE. A QUICKSCAT PASS JUST BEFORE 7 AM SHOWS EAST WINDS 15 
TO 20 KT IN THE STRAITS...WITH SEVERAL LOCATIONS AT 20 KT WELL 
OFFSHORE. SATELLITE AND RADAR DATA INDICATE A FAIR WEATHER PATTERN 
OVER THE KEYS THIS MORNING...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE BAY AND GULF WATERS...AND ONLY ISOLATED 
CONVECTION ELSEWHERE. HOWEVER...A LARGE AREA OF DISTRUBED WEATHER 
WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED 
TROPICAL WAVE...CAN BE SEEN APPROACHING FROM THE EAST. THE LEADING 
EDGE OF THIS DISTRUBED WEATHER IS CURRENTLY AROUND AND SOUTH OF

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500-200 MB)...A PROMINENT WARM 
CORE ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED OVER MISSISSIPPI...WITH RIDGING 
EXTENDING SOUTHWARD AND EASTWARD TO ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO AND 
OVER FLORIDA. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...THE AXIS OF A NARROW ELONGATED 
TROUGH EXTENDS FROM NORTHEAST OF THE BAHAMAS SOUTHWEST TO CENTRAL 
CUBA. SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS LIE BENEATH SOME 200 MB DIFFLUENCE 
MERGED BETWEEN THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE LARGE RIDGE TO THE 
NORTHWEST...AND THE STRETCHED OUT UPPER TROUGH TO THE IMMEDIATE EAST.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...TO THE EAST...A 
WEAK WAVE ALONG THE LONGITUDE OF HISPANIOLA IS MOVING WEST AT 15 TO 
20 KT. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...A 1020 MB RIDGE IS POSITIONED FROM 
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TO ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE 
BENEATH DEEP AND MOIST MODERATE TO FRESH EAST TO NORTHEASTERLY FLOW 
FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 25 KFT. 

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 AM...TYPICAL AUGUST NIGHT IN THE FLORIDA 
KEYS. SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE ISLANDS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 
MIDDLE 70S. KEY WEST RADAR DEPICTS SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
SHOWERS MOVING ACROSS FLORIDA BAY...THE GULF WATERS...AND ATLANTIC 
WATERS FROM THE MIDDLE KEYS TO DRY TORTUGAS. OUTSIDE OF ANY
SHOWERS...C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA 
BAY ARE INDICATING MAINLY EAST 10 METER WINDS FROM 15 TO 18 KNOTS 
WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 20 AND 25 KNOTS...WITH THE EXCEPTION BEING SAND 
KEY CMAN WHICH CONTINUES TO REGISTER ERRONEOUSLY LOW FOR THE CURRENT 
SYNOPTIC ENVIRONMENT.

.FORECASTS...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500 TO 200 MB)...TONIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...NEAR 598 DM 500 MB RIDGING CENTERED OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES WILL LOOSEN A FEW DM...WITH THE CRUX OF 
THE HEAT DOME MOVING WESTWARD TOWARDS TEXAS. THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC 
TROUGH OVER THE BAHAMAS WILL SLIDE TO OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
KEYS BY TONIGHT...AND CONTINUE SLOWLY WESTWARD INTO THE GULF ON 
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL ALSO PROVIDE SLIGHT 200 MB DIVERGENCE AND SOME 
MID-LEVEL COOLING...WITH 500 MB TEMPS GOING DOWN TO -8 DEGREES 
CELSIUS FROM TONIGHT THRU WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...UPPER RIDGING AND ASSOCIATED HEIGHT RISES 
TO BACK ABOVE 590 DM AT 500 MB ARE FORECAST FOR THE KEYS...AS A 
TROPICAL ANTICYCLONE BUILDS OVER THE BAHAMAS...CUBA...THE SOUTHEAST 
GULF...AND THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...TODAY...1020 PLUS RIDGING WILL REMAIN 
ACROSS FLORIDA...ALLOWING FOR MAINTENANCE OF A DECENT BUT SLOWLY 
DECAYING GRADIENT. THE TROPICAL WAVE NOW OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
BAHAMAS/HISPANIOLA WILL APPROACH US FROM THE EAST. POP #S ARE NOW 
VERY LOW THROUGH THIS EVENING NEAR 20 PERCENT...BUT AS HAS BEEN THE 
CASE FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS...LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WITHIN DEEP 
EASTERLY TO EAST NORTHEASTERLY FLOW AND A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF 200 MB 
UPPER DIVERGENCE...HAS ALLOWED FOR DAILY SCATTERED SHRA ISOLD TSRA 
COVERAGE OVER THE WATERS AND THE ISLANDS. SO...WITH THOSE SETS OF 
OPPOSING FACTORS...WILL LEAVE THE INHERITED LOW CHANCE POPS GOING 
FOR TODAY. ANY ACTIVITY SHOULD TAPER DOWN LATE THIS MORNING.

TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...THE WEAK WAVE SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS 
TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 00Z NAM AND 
GFS ARE A BIT PERPLEXING. THE 00Z NAM NOW INDICATES 20 TO 30 PERCENT 
POPS...WHICH IS A SIGNIFICANT DECLINE FROM THE 12 HOUR #S FOR THE 
SAME PERIOD 2 RUNS AGO. IN ADDITION...THE WAVE AXIS IS HARDER TO 
DECIPHER IN THE FLOW THAN YESTERDAY RUNS...WHEN THE NAM AND GFS WERE 
EXACTLY IN SYNC WITH EACH OTHER. THE 00Z UKMET AND THE MORE 
CONSISTENT GFS SHOW THE WAVE AXIS MOVING WEST OF THE KEYS DURING 
WEDNESDAY. 12 HOUR POPS FOR BOTH PERIODS ARE ALSO BETWEEN 40 AND 50 
PERCENT. WILL HOLD WITH 40 PERCENT.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE WEAK WAVE/ LOW LEVEL TROUGH SHOULD SCOOT WEST 
OF THE KEYS...WHILE THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WEAKENS A BIT AND 
SLIDES SOUTHWARD TOWARDS SOUTH FLORIDA. A LIGHT TO GENTLE SOUTHEAST 
FLOW RESUMES ACROSS THE ISLANDS. MODEL POPS #S ARE NEAR 20 PERCENT 
FOR THIS PERIOD...AND SOME ADDITIONAL MID-LEVEL DRYING IS INDICATED 
BY THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS...BUT NOT ENOUGH TO DEVIATE FROM CLIMO 
POPS WE HAVE GOING.

EXTENDED...THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE IS 
FORECAST TO REMAIN JUST ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA...ALLOWING FOR A LIGHT 
TO GENTLE EAST SOUTHEAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW ACROSS THE AREA. THE MEX 
#S ARE IN THE ISOLATED CATEGORY FOR NOW...BUT STILL NEED TO WAIT A 
COUPLE OF RUNS BEFORE GOING BELOW CLIMO ATTM. ALTHOUGH NOT BEING 
DETECTED BY THE MRF AT THIS TIME....ANOTHER WEAK TROPICAL WAVE NOW 
ANALYZED NEAR THE CENTRAL WINDWARD ISLANDS MAY HAVE AN IMPACT ON 
RAIN CHANCES AT KEYS LONGITUDE BY LATE IN THE PERIOD. ALSO...AS WE 
MOVE INTO THE STEAMIEST PART OF THE YEAR...THIS ABUNDANT SUNSHINE 
WITH LIGHT TO GENTLE WINDS WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB 
A FEW MORE DEGREES...WITH HIGHS RISING GENERALLY INTO THE LOWER 90S 
AND LOWS IN THE LOWER 80S.

&&

.MARINE...LIKE YESTERDAY...HAVE NOT HAD ANY CRITICAL SHIP 
OBSERVATIONS IN KEYS WATERS SO FAR THIS MORNING. LAST EVENINGS 
QUICKSCAT PASS INDICATED A LARGE AREA OF 15 TO 20 KNOTTERS IN THE 
STRAITS. CURRENTLY WE HAVE A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY FOR SEAS. WITH 
BREEZY CONDITIONS CONTINUING AND THE GFS MOS #S FOR THE C-MANS 
MAINTAINING THIS THROUGH 00Z...WILL LET THE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY 
RIDE...BUT WITH THE APPROACH OF THE TROUGH/WEAK WAVE TONIGHT...WILL 
LIKELY BE ABLE TO DROP THE ADVISORY THIS AFTERNOON. 
THEREAFTER...IMPROVING BOATING CONDITIONS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND THURSDAY...WITH LIGHT TO GENTLE WINDS EXPECTED THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND.
   
&&

.AVIATION...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE BRISKLY 
WESTWARD ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE. SOME OF THIS 
ACTIVITY MAY OCCASIONALLY AFFECT ISLAND TERMINALS. THE STRONGEST SEA 
BREEZE CONVECTION WILL BE LOCATED WEST OF THE FLIGHT ROUTE DUE TO AN 
EASTERLY STEERING FLOW. SURFACE WINDS WILL GENERALLY BE EAST AT 10

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC RIDGE REMAINS INTACT...EXTENDING WEST ALONG THE 
FLORIDA-GEORGIA BORDER. PRESSURES OVER NORTH FLORIDA ARE 1022 MB 
ALONG THE RIDGE AXIS AT THE ATLANTIC COAST. KEYS AREA WINDS THIS 
AFTERNOON ARE SIMILAR TO THIS MORNING...WHICH WAS WELL-REPRESENTED 
BY THAT EARLY MORNING QUIKSCAT PASS. C-MAN REPORTS ON THE REEF SHOW 
EAST WINDS VARYING 14-17 KT SUSTAINED...GUSTS TO 22 KT. WINDS ARE 
PROBABLY A FEW KNOTS STRONGER OFFSHORE IN THE STRAITS. KEY WEST 
DOPPLER RADAR AGREES...SHOWING WINDS AT 1 THSD FT AGL VARYING FROM 
15 TO 20 KT. VISIBLE SATELLITE CONTINUES TO SHOW A GENERALLY 
UNDISTURBED WEATHER PATTERN OVER THE KEYS AND UPSTREAM TO THE 
BAHAMAS...WITH JUST FAST MOVING WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE REGION. WATER VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER 
IMAGES SHOW DRIER AIR ALOFT OVER THE BAHAMAS AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC.
LARGE MAINLAND THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS SO FAR ARE FORMING AND HEADING 
WEST OVER COLLIER COUNTY WATERS. THERE ARE THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS 
OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN...ALSO HEADING WEST. OF IMPORTANCE IS 
THE LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT HAS EXPANDED TODAY 
AROUND PUERTO RICO AND NORTHWARD OVER ATLANTIC WATERS. A TROPICAL 
WAVE IS ANALYZED WITH THIS CONVECTION...BUT ALSO THE AREA IS BEING 
INFLUENCED BY THE OUTER CIRCULATION OF ANOTHER LARGE UPPER 
TROPOSPHERIC LOW SPINNING JUST NE OF THE BAHAMAS. DRY AIR ALOFT IS
SEEN ON THE WEST SIDE OF THIS LOW...WITH THE STRONG THUNDERSTORM 
CLUSTERS ON THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST SIDES. 

.FORECAST...
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...THERE MAY BE A SLIGHT BOOST IN WINDS OVERNIGHT 
ACCORDING TO THE GFS...MAINLY OUT IN THE STRAITS...WHILE THE NAM 
SHOWS AN OVERALL INCREASE IN WINDS BY 5 KT OVER THE KEYS AREA 
TONIGHT. THE GFS HAS BEEN A BIT BETTER VERIFYING LATELY...BUT I WILL 
INDICATE 15 MPH AND GUSTY FOR ISLANDS WINDS TONIGHT AND TUESDAY FOR 
THE POSSIBLE INCREASE. THAT IS CLOSE TO WINDS REPORTED AT ISLAND 
LOCATIONS CURRENTLY.  SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR ALOFT IS INDICATED BY 
MODELS TO MOVE IN TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...WITH THAT DRYING MAINLY IN 
THE 850 TO 700 MB LAYER. MOS GUIDANCES ALL SHOW 20 PCT CHANCE OF 
PRECIP TONIGHT...GOING TO 40-50 PCT TUE. I WILL INDICATE 30 PCT BOTH 
PERIODS...SINCE FAST MOVING LATE NIGHT SHOWERS ARE AGAIN POSSIBLE. 

TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...MODELS NOW SHOW THE LARGE UPPER 
TROPOSPHERIC LOW NE OF THE BAHAMAS TO MOVE WEST RATHER RAPIDLY...
WITH THE LOW CENTER REACHING TUESDAY EVENING...PROGRESSING WEST INTO 
THE GULF BY WEDNESDAY. A 500 MB LOW OR TROUGH IS SHOWN TO FOLLOW 
JUST EAST OF THE 250 MB LOW...WITH A SLOPING DOWNWARD AND EASTWARD TO
A LOW LEVEL TROUGH WHICH IS INTERPRETED TO BE A TROPICAL WAVE. 
BOTH NAM AND GFS HAVE THE LOWER LEVEL (SURFACE-850 MB) WAVE AXIS 
CROSSING THE KEYS LATE TUE NIGHT OR EARLY WED. A SPIKE IN MOISTURE 
DEPTH ALONG WITH A PERIOD OF DEEP LAYER LIFT IS SHOWN BY THE GFS TO 
CROSS THE KEYS TUE NIGHT AND WED. GIVEN THE CURRENT ONGOING 
CONVECTION SE OF THE UPPER LOW...I WILL KEEP 40 PCT POPS FOR TUE 
NIGHT AND WED (MOS POPS ARE 40-50 PCT)...WILL INDICATE MORE CLOUD 
COVER. HIGHER CHANCES OF RAIN MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THIS PERIOD IN 
SUBSEQUENT FORECASTS IF THIS PATTERN HOLDS. SURFACE WINDS SHOULD GO 
ESE TO SE WITH WAVE PASSAGE...AND WIND SPEEDS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP 
AS INFLUENCE OF THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH FADES. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT MONDAY...THE GFS SHOWS A PROLONGED 
PERIOD WITH A WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE NEARBY THE KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA. 
THIS WOULD INDICATE LIGHT WINDS. POPS AT 30 PCT WILL BE CARRIED.
THERE ARE UPS-AND-DOWNS IN MOISTURE DEPTH THROUGH IS PERIOD 
INDICATED IN THE EXTENDED GFS...AND THERE MAY BE SOME DAILY 
PREFERRED TIMES FOR TCU/CB DEVELOPMENT OVER THE KEYS DEPENDING ON 
MOISTURE AND LIGHT WIND FLOW. ITS TOO SOON TO SPECULATE ON THE LONG 
RANGE FATE OF THE STRONG TROPICAL WAVE NOW WELL EAST OF THE LESSER 
ANTILLES. 
&&

.MARINE...
LARGE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP KEYS WINDS BLOWING FROM THE 
EAST IN THE 15-20 KT AND GUSTY RANGE OVER STRAITS WATERS...15 KT AND 
GUSTY OVER BAY AND GULF. MIGHT SEE SUSTAINED WINDS CLOSER TO 20 KT 
THE FARTHER OUT ONE GOES IN THE STRAITS. THESE WINDS HAVE PROBABLY 
BUILT SEAS INTO THE 4-7 FT RANGE BEYOND THE REEF...SO A SMALL CRAFT 
ADVISORY FOR HAZARDOUS SEAS WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY. 
IF WINDS SURGE OVERNIGHT...SCA FOR WINDS AND SEAS BOTH MAY HAVE TO 
BE RE-ISSUED. A WEAK TROPICAL WAVE ACCOMPANIED BY SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IS EXPECTED TO PASS THE KEYS TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY...TURNING WINDS TO ESE BUT ALSO DROPPING SPEEDS. WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO SETTLE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA THURSDAY THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND...AND THIS SHOULD BRING ESE OR SE WINDS 10 KT OR LESS TO 
KEYS WATERS. 
&&

.AVIATION...

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE BRIEF CIRCUMNAVIGABLE 
MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE MAINLY

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500-200 MB)...A PRONOUNCED WARM 
CORE ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SOUTH 
OF THAT...AN UPPER LOW OVER THE YUCATAN IS ELONGATING INTO AN UPPER 
TROUGH ACROSS THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO. TO THE EAST...ANOTHER 
UPPER LOW IS ALSO BECOMING STRETCHED OUT FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE ALONG THE 
SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN 
UNITED STATES...MAINLY BENEATH DRY ANTICYCLONIC FLOW.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...A WEAK STATIONARY 
FRONT IS POSITIONED FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN TO THE CAROLINA 
COAST. SOUTH OF THAT...A 1020 MB PLUS SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
IS CENTERED NEAR 30N 70W WITH THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE 
EXTENDING WEST SOUTHWESTWARD TO ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA. TO THE 
WEST...A WEAK LOW LEVEL TROUGH...THE LIKELY REMNANTS OF TD 
CHRIS...IS MOVING WESTWARD OVER THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. THE KEYS 
LIE BENEATH THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE RIDGE WITHIN MOIST MODERATE 
TO FRESH MAINLY EAST FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOUT 30 KFT.

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 AM...PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES EXIST ACROSS THE 
KEYS ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 
LOWER 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MIDDLE 70S. KBYX RADAR DEPICTS JUST 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE OUTER FLORIDA 
STRAITS OFF OF THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN...WITH A FEW SHOWERS REACHING 
PORTIONS OF THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE 
FLORIDA REEF AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE REGISTERING MAINLY EAST 10 
METER WINDS BETWEEN 11 AND 17 KNOTS WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 17 AND 22 
KNOTS. HAVE NOT RECEIVED ANY SHIP REPORTS YET THIS MORNING. A

IN THE OUTER FLORIDA STRAITS.  

.FORECASTS...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500 TO 200 MB)...TONIGHT THRU 
TUESDAY...NEAR 595 DM 500 MB RIDING WILL REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN CONUS AND WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN. 

ON WEDNESDAY...LATEST 00Z GFS AND ECMWF INDICATES A WEAK UPPER

KEYS...WITH 500 MB TEMPS DROPPING JUST TO AROUND -8 CENTIGRADE AND 
SOME 200 MB DIVERGENCE FIELDS MOVING ACROSS...WITH THE UPPER LOW 
EXITING TO THE WEST SOMETIME THURSDAY. 

590 DM PLUS RIDGING IS FORECAST TO BUILD IN FROM THE BAHAMAS FOR 
FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL MAINTAIN 1020 MB PLUS RIDGING ACROSS NORTH 
FLORIDA...RESULTING IN A CONTINUATION OF A DECENT GRADIENT. DO NOT 
SEE ANY RECOGNIZABLE SCALE PERTURBATIONS WITH A DEEP MOIST FLOW 
WHICH WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE KEYS...WITH PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER) 
RUNNING BETWEEN 1.7 AND 2.0 INCHES THROUGH TUESDAY. CONSIDERING 
LULLS AND PEAKS...ON BALANCE...THIS WILL RESULT IN BREEZY CONDITIONS 
OVER THE ISLANDS...WITH BORDERLINE SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS 
ON THE ATLANTIC WATERS THROUGH TUESDAY. LATEST 00Z GFS AND NAM 12 HR 
POP #S ARE BETWEEN LOW CHANCE AND MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE. 
HOWEVER...GIVEN THE DEEP MOIST PROFILE WITH HIGH PWAT AND ASSOCIATED 
LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WITHIN THIS PATTERN...WOULD BE PRUDENT TO HOLD 
WITH MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POP. 

.TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...A WEAK WAVE...OR LOW LEVEL TROUGH 
NOW LOCATED IN THE WEST INDIES...(WINDWARD ISLANDS)...WILL REACH THE 
LONGITUDE OF THE FLORIDA KEYS EITHER TUESDAY NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY WITH 
THE MODELS DIFFERING SLIGHTLY IN THE TIMING. 12 HOUR POP #S GO FROM 
30 TO 40 PERCENT TUESDAY NIGHT TO 35 TO 55 PERCENT ON WEDNESDAY. 
GIVEN THE UPPER LOW IN PLACE AND DIVERGENCE...WILL HOLD WITH 
INHERITED MIDDLE OF THE ROAD POPS AT 40 PERCENT. AGAIN...WE ALREADY 
HAVE THIS IN PLACE FOR THIS PERIOD. 

EXTENDED...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...AFTER PASSAGE OF THE 
AFOREMENTIONED WEAK WAVE...THE SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS CENTRAL AND 
NORTH FLORIDA WILL SLIDE SOUTHWARD TO ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA...BUT MEX 
#S REMAIN LOW BEHIND THIS SYSTEM. WILL HOLD WITH CLIMO POPS...MOST 
LIKELY DUE TO JUST MESOSCALE PROCESSES AT THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS...
IN WAKE OF THE TROPICAL WAVE MOVING WESTWARD OVER THE SOUTHEAST GULF 
OF MEXICO...A STRENGTHENING WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE IS BUILDING 
ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA. THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO 
SYSTEMS IS RESULTING IN EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS OF 15 KNOTS ON THE 
WATERS NORTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN...AND 15 TO OCCASIONALLY 20 KNOTS 
ON THE ATLANTIC WATERS. MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING AN 
INCREASING AREA OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE UPPER 
KEYS AND THE ADJACENT FLORIDA BAY...AND ATLANTIC WATERS OUT 60 
MILES...WITH ONLY A FEW SHOWERS ELSEWHERE. OTHERWISE...OUR EVENING 
SOUNDING REVEALS A VERY MOIST AIRMASS (PWAT 1.97 INCHES) WITHIN A 
DEEP EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW REACHING WELL INTO THE TROPOSPHERE. 

OVERNIGHT FORECASTS:
GIVEN THE ABOVE NORMAL MOISTURE...THE DEEP AND MODERATE EASTERLY 
FLOW COMBINED WITH A FAVORED NOCTURNAL TIME PERIOD SUPPORTS ABOVE 
NORMAL POPS WHICH IS ABOVE MOS GUIDANCE. HENCE...NO CHANGES ARE 
PLANNED TO THE CURRENT PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST.

MODEL GUIDANCE INDICATES THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BUILD 
SLIGHTLY ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA OVERNIGHT. DESPITE A SLIGHT LULL IN 
WINDS ON ALL WATERS EARLY TONIGHT...EXPECT ANOTHER SUBTLE SURGE 
OVERNIGHT. THEREFORE...WILL MAINTAIN A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY ON THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS AND NEAR 15 KNOTS ON THE WATERS NORTH OF THE ISLAND

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A LOW LEVEL (BUT NOT NECESSARILY AT THE SURFACE) CYCLONIC CLOUD 
SWIRL IS SEEN ON VISIBLE SATELLITE...NOW MOVING WEST OUT OF THE SW 
FLORIDA STRAITS AND INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. THIS APPARENTLY IS
THE REMAINS FOR FORMER TROPICAL DEPRESSION CHRIS. THE ATLANTIC HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDING WEST TO NORTH FLORIDA-SOUTH GEORGIA IS 
STILL A LITTLE STRONGER THAN MODELS HAVE INDICATED FOR 18Z (2 PM).
DAYTONA BEACH PRESSURE IS 1020 MB...MODELS ARE INDICATING 1018-1019 
MB FOR THIS TIME. AT ANY RATE...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE KEYS 
IS NOW PRODUCING AS MUCH WIND SPEED AS EVER FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS...
WITH C-MAN SITES ON THE REEF PULSING TO NEAR 20 KT AT TIMES (RATHER 
VARIABLE ACTUALLY FROM HOUR-TO-HOUR) BUT PEAK GUSTS ARE IN THE 22-28 
KT RANGE. LONG KEY ON THE BAY SIDE IS RUNNING 15-18 KT SUSTAINED 
GUSTS TO 20 KT. THICKER CLOUD COVER HAS SHIFTED TO THE WEST OF THE 
KEYS. WHILE OVERALL SHOWER COVERAGE IS LESS...THERE STILL ARE
LINES OF SHOWERS WITH THUNDERSTORMS ALIGNED WITH THE LOWER LEVEL 
WIND FLOW (ESE TO WNW)...THE MAIN ONE NOW HEADING INTO THE LOWER 
KEYS. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE SHOWS DRIER AIR TO OUR EAST...WHILE 
GOES SOUNDER SUGGESTS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES JUST EAST OF THE 
KEYS TO THE BAHAMAS IS AROUND 1.7-1.8 INCHES. THIS DRY AIR IS 
ESTIMATED TO BE MAINLY ABOVE 850 MB WITH DRIEST AIR RELEGATED TO 
ABOVE 700 MB. SMALL CU LINES ARE BLOWING WNW OFF THE BAHAMA 
ISLANDS...AND WITHIN ONE OF THESE A MINISCULE SHORT-LIVED 
THUNDERSTORM WAS ABLE TO DEVELOP NEAR ANDROS ISLAND AN HOUR AGO. 

.FORECASTS...
TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...WINDS MAY FLUCTUATE AROUND THE 15 TO 20 
MPH RANGE TONIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY...BUT THE GFS MODEL (WHICH DOES 
NOT HAVE AN OVERDONE LOW PRESSURE AREA ASSOCIATED WITH FORMER CHRIS) 
INDICATES OVERALL WINDS MAY JUMP UP IN SPEED A BIT DURING MONDAY AND 
PERSIST THAT WAY THROUGH TUESDAY. THEREFORE I WILL INDICATE A 
CONTINUED BREEZY CONDITION THROUGH TUESDAY...GRANTING THAT SOME 
DIPS IN WIND MAY OCCUR TONIGHT OR EARLY MONDAY. THIS BREEZY PERIOD
IS DUE TO SOME EXPANSION OF THE ATLANTIC RIDGE OVER NORTH AND 
CENTRAL FLORIDA. ALL MODEL OUTPUT IS FOR LOW POPS TONIGHT (20 PCT) 
BUT THE DRY AIR ALOFT IS CONFINED MOSTLY TO ABOVE 700 MB ALTHOUGH 
SOME LESS RH VALUES (60-70 PCT) ARE SHOWN BY MODELS TO DIP DOWN 
BETWEEN 700 MB AND 850 MB TONIGHT AND MONDAY. I AM LEAVING POPS 
TONIGHT AT 40 PCT...SOME SMALL SHOWER LINES MAY CONTINUE TO MOVE OFF 
THE BAHAMAS TO THE KEYS...AND THE FAST MOVEMENT OF SHOWERS COULD 
SWEEP OUT MORE AREA THAN SLOWER MOVING CONVECTION. DESPITE SIMILAR
MOISTURE FOR MONDAY...AND NO STRONG SIGNS OF LIFT...THE GFS MODEL 
AND NAM MODEL BOTH HAVE HIGHER POPS (50 PCT TO 60 PCT)...AND I AM 
NOT SURE WHY. 40 PCT WILL BE CARRIED EACH PERIOD ON THROUGH TUESDAY
DURING THE BREEZY PERIOD. TUESDAY MAY HAVE DEEPER MOISTURE. 

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...I AM BOOSTING POPS TO 40 PCT FOR 
EACH PERIOD DURING THIS TIME FRAME AS DEEPER MOISTURE AND SOME LARGE 
SCALE LIFT IS SHOWN TO SET IN OVER THE KEYS. THERE WILL BE A DEEP 
EAST OR EAST-SOUTHEAST FLOW ONGOING...FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 400 MB 
AS WELL...WHICH COULD TEND TO AUGMENT LATE NIGHT AND MORNING SHOWER 
COVERAGE. A WEAK LOW LEVEL TROUGH IS INDICATED TO MOVE OVER THE 
REGION WEDNESDAY WHICH MAY AID LOW LEVEL LIFT. THEN FROM THURSDAY 
ONWARD...OUTER WINDS OF THE LARGE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW NOW WELL 
EAST OF THE BAHAMAS ARE EXPECTED TO REACH THE KEYS WITH SOME 
INDICATIONS OF A HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENT PATTERN...AS THAT UPPER LOW
DRIFTS WEST. THEREFORE...ILL JUST KEEP THE 40 PERCENTERS GOING 
THROUGH THIS TIME FRAME. MEANWHILE AT THE SURFACE...THE LARGE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE NOW OVER NORTH FLORIDA IS FORECAST TO SHIFT TOWARD 
SOUTH FLORIDA...AND THIS SHOULD RELAX THE LOCAL PRESSURE GRADIENT 
GIVING LESS WIND SPEEDS. 

THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...ACTUALLY THE PERIOD THURSDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY MAY SEE THE KEYS UNDER INFLUENCE OF A LARGE UPPER 
TROPOSPHERIC LOW CENTER THAT WILL HAVE DRIFTED WEST TO SOUTH 
FLORIDA. OUTER DIVERGENCE EFFECTS AROUND THE LOW MAY AFFECT THE 
KEYS...EXCEPT SOME COLD POOL ALOFT EFFECTS MAY BE SEEN AS THE LOW 
PASSES OVERHEAD OR NEARBY THU NIGHT THROUGH FRI NIGHT...WITH THE
GFS SHOWING A 500 MB COOL POOL OF -10C TEMPERATURES. WITH 
UNCERTAINTY AT THESE LONGER RANGE TIME PERIODS...I AM KEEPING 
ONGOING 30 PCT POPS FOR THUR NIGHT-SUNDAY...AND ASSESS TIMING OF 
LATER NEEDED HIGHER POPS. THE SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD BE NEARBY...
KEEPING WIND SPEEDS LIGHT MOST OF THIS TIME. 
&&

.MARINE...
PRESSURES REMAIN HIGHER OVER NORTH FLORIDA AND SHOULD STAY THAT WAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY...WHILE LOWER PRESSURE MOVES WEST FROM THE STRAITS 
AND INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER NORTH 
FLORIDA MAY EVEN EXPAND SOUTHWARD A BIT. THEREFORE...BREEZIER 
CONDITIONS MAY PERSIST OVER THE KEYS INTO TUESDAY...BEFORE 
DECREASING TUESDAY NIGHT ON THROUGH FRIDAY AS THE RIDGE SHIFTS
CLOSER TO THE KEYS AND WE RELAX LOCAL PRESSURE GRADIENT. 

WINDS MAY BE MARGINAL OR RIGHT AT SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY CONDITIONS
(20 KT) TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY OVER THE STRAITS...SMALL CRAFT WILL 
NEED TO EXERCISE CAUTION ON BAY AND GULF WATERS. A DROP OF WIND 
SPEEDS INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE IS EXPECTED WEDNESDAY AS THE RIDGE 
SLIPS TO SOUTH FLORIDA. 
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE QUICKLY WEST 
NORTHWESTWARD OVER THE ROUTE...ESPECIALLY THE KEYS PORTION THIS

215 AM EDT SUN AUG 6 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500-200 MB)...SATELLITE IMAGERY 
AND OBSERVATIONS DEPICT A WARM CORE UPPER ANTICYCLONIC RIDGE 
EXTENDING FROM THE SOUTHERN OHIO VALLEY TO OFF THE NORTH CAROLINA 
COAST. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE AND SOUTH OF THAT...TWO WELL DEFINED 
UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGHS ARE SIGNIFICANT...WITH THE AXIS OF ONE 
NOW IN THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEX AND THE AXIS OF THE SECOND LOCATED A 
FEW HUNDRED MILES NORTHEAST OF THE TURKS AND CAICOS ISLANDS. THE 
FLORIDA KEYS LIE BETWIXT BOTH UPPER LOW/TROUGHS...BENEATH A SOMEWHAT 
DIFFLUENT AND MOIST REGION OF LIGHT UPPER FLOW.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...A WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED 28N 62W...WITH THE WESTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE OVER SOUTHEAST GEORGIA. A WEAK MID-LEVEL 
LOW...NEAR 700 MB IS JUST SOUTH OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. ON THE 
REGIONAL SCALE...A TROPICAL WAVE/BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS 
LOCATED IN THE EASTERN FLORIDA STRAITS WITH ITS MAIN AXIS NOW 
TRAVERSING THE FLORIDA KEYS.

.CURRENTLY...SKIES ARE CLOUDY OVER THE KEYS AND ALL ADJOINING 
WATERS. KEY WEST AND MIAMI RADAR INDICATES WIDESPREAD AREAS OF LIGHT 
TO MODERATE RAIN COVERING THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS. THIS LARGE AREA CONTAINS NUMEROUS EMBEDDED HEAVIER SHOWERS 
AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. FARTHER TO THE WEST...SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE LOCATED OVER GMZ033 AND THE WESTERN FLORIDA 
STRAITS. ALL OF THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS HAVE BEEN DELIVERING GUSTS 
BETWEEN 35 AND 40 KNOTS THROUGH LAST EVENING AND INTO THIS 
MORNING...SO MANY SPECIAL MARINE WARNINGS HAVE BEEN POSTED...WITH 
SOME CURRENTLY IN EFFECT. THE MAIN AXIS OF THIS WAVE IS NOW 
POSITIONED FROM THE UPPER KEYS SOUTHWARD TO TO CENTRAL CUBA AND 
MIGRATING WEST AT AN UNKNOWN SPEED. TEMPERATURES ARE BETWEEN 75 AND 
80 WITHIN THE RAIN COOLED LOCATIONS...AND AROUND 80 ELSEWHERE. C-MAN 
STATIONS ALONG THE REEF FROM MOLASSES REEF LIGHT EASTWARD AND 
SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE INDICATING SUSTAINED 10 METER WINDS OUTSIDE 
OF CONVECTION BETWEEN 15 AND 22 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 24 AND 29 
GUSTS...WHILE WINDS AT SAND KEY AND PULASKI SHOAL ARE BETWEEN 10 AND 
15 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 19 AND 23 KNOTS.   

.FORECASTS...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500 TO 200 MB)...TODAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY...UPPER RIDGING WILL REMAIN STRONG FROM THE SOUTHCENTRAL AND 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN...WITH 
500 MB HEIGHTS BETWEEN 595 AND 598 DM.

TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...THE UPPER LOW PRESSURE PRESENTLY OVER THE 
CENTRAL GULF WILL MOVE INTO TEXAS. THE SECOND UPPER LOW PRESSURE 
AREA NOW NORTH OF THE TURKS AND CAICOS WILL MOVE TO OVER SOUTH 
FLORIDA BY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...AND REMAIN NEAR THE SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND KEYS AREA THRU NEXT WEEKEND.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...TODAY...A COMPLEX PATTERN IS IN PLACE. 
THE BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA/TROPICAL WAVE SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING 
WESTWARD ACROSS THE FLORIDA STRAITS THIS MORNING. A WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE SOUTH AND BUILD ACROSS NORTH 
FLORIDA. HOWEVER...THERE ARE NOT REALLY GOOD INDICATIONS THAT THE 
COMPLEX LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL MOVE AWAY IN A HURRY. 
NEVERTHELESS...THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY WILL BE CLOUDY WITH PERIODS 
OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN CONTAINING NUMEROUS EMBEDDED SHOWERS AND 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. WILL MOVE THE WAVE AXIS FAR ENOUGH WEST BY 
THIS AFTERNOON SUCH THAT CONDITIONS SHOULD IMPROVE BY LATE. IN TERMS 
OF RAIN CHANCES...WILL FORECAST LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS FOR THE 
FIRST PART OF THE DAY. WILL HOLD WITH GOOD CHANCE POPS FOR THE 
AFTERNOON GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY. THE COMBINATION OF THE BROAD LOW 
PRESSURE PASSING OVERHEAD...AND A WELL ESTABLISHED RIDGE WILL RESULT 
IN A DECENT GRADIENT. THIS WILL RESULT IN BREEZY CONDITIONS OVER THE 
ISLANDS...WITH SMALL CRAFT CONDITIONS DEVELOPING BAY LATER THIS 
MORNING ON ALL WATERS.  

TONIGHT...GIVEN CURRENT SYNOPTIC REASONING...THE BROAD LOW/TROPICAL 
WAVE SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE WESTWARD ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO WITHIN THE FRESH TO OCCASIONALLY STRONG FLOW...AND WITHIN THE 
FLOW SOME ADDITIONAL SLUGS OF LOW AND MID-LEVEL MOISTURE COULD 
MOVE IN. SURFACE WINDS COULD STILL BE BORDERLINE ADVISORY IN THE 
STRAITS...BUT WILL LIKELY BE EXERCISE CAUTION ON ALL WATERS. HAVE 
INHERITED GOOD CHANCE POPS...AND MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY COULD STILL 
BE IN THE EVENING...WITH ACTIVITY TAPERING OFF LATER IN THE EVENING 
FROM EAST TO WEST. 

MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A 1022-1025 MB WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE SHOULD REMAIN STRONG JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE KEYS...WITH WEAK 
PERTURBATIONS MOVING THROUGH THE LOW LEVELS. DEEP EASTERLY FLOW WITH 
PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER) VALUES BETWEEN 1.80 AND 2.00 INCHES WILL 
RESULT IN ABOVE NORMAL OR MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS EACH DAY. 
THIS IS RIGHT NEAR 12 HOUR MAV MOS #S. ANOTHER...MORE PRONOUNCED LOW 
LEVEL TROUGH/WEAK WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MEX 12 HOUR POPS FOR THIS PERIOD IS AT 
50%...BUT WILL STILL KEEP POPS AT 40 PERCENT FOR NOW.

THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...DRIER AIR AND LIGHTER WINDS WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE AREA AS THE RIDGE MOVES SOUTH CLOSER TO THE KEYS. THE 
MAIN SOURCE OF RAIN WILL PROBABLY BE JUST DUE TO MESOSCALE 
FORCING...SO IS PRUDENT TO HOLD WITH CLIMO POPS FOR THIS PERIOD. 

&&

.MARINE...WIDESPREAD AREA OF RAIN WITH NUMEROUS EMBEDDED SHOWERS AND 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE SPREADING FROM EAST TO WEST ACROSS THE 
WATERS...AND AS THE WAVE AXIS SLIDE WEST THIS MORNING...ACTIVITY 
SHOULD TAPER DOWN. WILL SEE SCA ON ALL WATERS TODAY...AND POSSIBLY 
ON JUST ATLANTIC WATERS FOR THE FIRST PART OF TONIGHT. 
THEREAFTER...A DECENT GRADIENT WILL REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH MUCH OF 
THE WEEK...WITH EXERCISE CAUTION POSTED FOR AT LEAST THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS THROUGH THURSDAY. MARINERS SHOULD CLOSELY FOLLOW ALL ADVISORS 
AND FURTHER STATEMENTS FROM THE NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE IN KEY WEST.
   
&&

.AVIATION...MVFR CONDITIONS WILL AFFECT ABOUT 50% OF THE KMIA-KEYW 
FLIGHT ROUTE THIS MORNING. IFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED ALONG ABOUT 25% 
OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THIS MORNING. WINDS GUSTS NEAR 30 
KNOTS WILL ACCOMPANY THE STRONGEST SHOWERS AND STORMS. CONVECTIVE 
SIGMET ISSUANCES ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THIS 
MORNING. MVFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH THIS 
MORNING...WITH IFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED AT TIMES AS STRONGER SHOWERS 
PASS CLOSE TO OR OVER THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. WEATHER

ANALYSIS...
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A TROPICAL WAVE...THE REMNANTS OF 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION CHRIS...EXTENDING FROM JAMAICA ACROSS EAST 
CENTRAL CUBA...AND NORTHWARD BETWEEN ANDROS ISLAND AND THE EASTERN 
STRAITS. GOES-12 IR IMAGERY SHOWS A LARGE AND RATHER COLD (-72 
DEGREES C) CONVECTIVE COMPLEX...ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPICAL WAVE 
BETWEEN ANDROS ISLAND AND THE NORTH COAST OF EAST CENTRAL CUBA. 
ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE 
NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF AROUND 15 KNOTS WITH STRONGER GUSTS NEAR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. OTHERWISE...OUR EVENING RAWINDSONDE 
REVEALS A DEEP AND STRENGTHENING NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW REACHING 
WELL INTO THE TROPOSPHERE...WITH SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL MOISTURE 
(PWAT 1.85 INCHES).

OVERNIGHT FORECASTS:
WITH THE AXIS OF THE TROPICAL WAVE MOVING INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF 
OUR REGION OVERNIGHT AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE LYING ACROSS 
CENTRAL FLORIDA LIFTING NORTHWARD...LOW LEVEL CONFLUENCE AND 
MOISTURE WILL INCREASE FOR THE BALANCE OF TONIGHT AND SUNDAY 
MORNING. GIVEN THE ADDITIONAL CONVERGENCE AND MOISTURE...INCREASING 
EASTERLY SHEAR SHOULD ALLOW ORGANIZED CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS 
TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE. FURTHERMORE...WITH OCCASIONAL HEAVY 
DOWNPOURS...TEMPERATURES SHOULD FALL INTO THE MID AND UPPER 70S. 
HENCE...HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST TO INSERT 
LIKELY POPS AND OPENED UP A LOW TEMPERATURE RANGE OF 75 TO 80 
DEGREES.   

&&

.MARINE...
WITH THE APPROACHING TROPICAL WAVE...NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS WILL 
GRADUALLY INCREASE TO 15 TO 20 KNOTS OVERNIGHT ON ALL WATERS. 
SUBSEQUENTLY...SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE CAUTION ON ALL WATERS. 
FURTHERMORE...WITH THE FAST MOVING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WINDS 
AND SEAS WILL BE EVEN HIGHER. THEREAFTER...A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY 
MAY BE REQUIRED ON SUNDAY FOR ALL WATERS. 

&&

.AVIATION...
GIVE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS A WIDE BERTH THIS EVENING. SURFACE 
WIND GUSTS GREATER THAN 25 KNOTS WILL ACCOMPANY MOST STORMS...ALONG 
WITH TURBULENCE AND LOW CIGS/VSBYS. MIAMI CENTER IS ISSUING

CURRENTLY...A TROPICAL WAVE STRETCHES FROM ANDROS THROUGH CENTRAL 
CUBA...WITH CONVECTION ON BOTH ITS NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST SIDES.  
CLOSER TO HOME...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS STRETCH FROM JUST 
SOUTHWEST OF CAPE SABLE TO LAKE OKEECHOBEE.  A CU LINE HAS DEVELOPED 
ALONG AND NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS...WITH JUST A FEW SHOWERS IN IT.  
WINDS ARE NORTHEAST IN ADVANCE OF THE WAVE...BUT BEGINNING TO TURN 
EASTERLY IN THE UPPER KEYS.  EAST OF THE WAVE IS AN UPPER LEVEL LOW 
THAT HAS SOME CONVECTION UNDER IT.  

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)
THE WAVE AXIS WILL CROSS THE KEYS TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...BRINGING 
INCREASING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AFTER MIDNIGHT.  THE RAINS WILL 
CONTINUE OFF AND ON THROUGH SUNDAY...AS THE FLOW GOES SOUTHEAST IN 
THE SURFACE AND MID LEVELS.  GIVEN THE CONVECTION ALREADY ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE WAVE...WILL INCREASE POPS JUST A BIT FOR TONIGHT AND 
MONDAY.  

.LONG TERM....(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)
POPS WILL DECREASE BRIEFLY ON SUNDAY NIGHT UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF

CURRENTLY...THE REMNANTS OF CHRIS ARE LOCATED NEAR THE SOUTHERN 
BAHAMAS.  CHRIS HAS LOST ALL TROPICAL CYCLONE CHARACTERISTICS AND IS 
BACIALLY NOW A TROPICAL WAVE.  MEANWHILE...A RIDGE OF ATLANTIC HIGH 
PRESSURE IS STRETCHED ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA...WHILE AN UPPER LEVEL 
LOW IS LOCATED NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE MS.  A FEW SHOWERS NOTED ON 
RADAR IN THE STRAITS AND NEAR THE LOWER KEYS.  SURFACE WINDS MAINLY 
NORTHEAST IN ADVANCE OF THE WAVE...BUT HAVE NOT YET INCREASED IN 
SPEED.  

FORECAST...THE TROPICAL WAVE WILL MOVE WESTWARD...INCREASING THE 
SURFACE GRADIENT ACROSS THE KEYS...AS WELL AS THE RAIN CHANCES.  
WINDS WILL PICK UP TONIGHT IN THE STRAITS...AND ACROSS THE WHOLE 
AREA TOMORROW.  BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE SUNDAY AFTERNOON...AFTER 
THE WAVE AXIS PASSES AND WINDS GO SOUTHEAST AT THE SURFACE AND THE 
MIDLEVELS.  ONCE THE WAVE IS PAST...RAIN CHANCES REDUCE TO NEAR 
CLIMO BY TUESDAY.

CORRECTED AVIATION DISCUSSION

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500-200 MB)...ON THE REGIONAL 
SCALE...A SPRAWLING WARM CORE ANTICYCLONE IS SITUATED JUST OFF THE 
NORTH CAROLINA COAST. SOUTH OF THAT...A COLD CORE UPPER LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS SPINNING WEST SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO. FARTHER TO THE EAST...ANOTHER WELL DEFINED UPPER 
TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE IS PUSHING WESTWARD ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
ABOUT 100 MILES NORTH OF THE MONA PASSAGE. SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
KEYS LIE STILL REMAIN BENEATH CYCLONIC BUT DRYING WESTERN PERIPHERY 
SIDE OF THE EASTERN GULF UPPER LOW.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...ON THE REGIONAL 
SCALE...THE CENTER OF A STRONG EAST TO WEST ORIENTED RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE IS POSITIONED NEAR 28N 60W...WITH THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF 
THIS ELONGATED RIDGE REACHING JUST EAST OF CENTRAL FLORIDA. A 
SMALLER AND WEAKER CENTER OF ANOTHER HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS 
CENTERED THE EASTERN GULF. TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE KEYS...THE POORLY 
DEFINED CENTER TROPICAL DEPRESSION CHRIS...AT 1100 PM WAS CENTERED 
135 MILES SOUTH-SOUTHEAST OF LONG ISLAND IN THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS. THE 
KEYS LIE WITHIN A LIGHT AND CHAOTIC BUT MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER WITHIN 
SOMEWHAT OF A COL REGION. FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION REGARDING 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION CHRIS...PLEASE REFER TO THE LATEST PUBLIC 
ADVISORY ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER.

.CURRENTLY...LAST EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED THAT THE FLORIDA KEYS 
LIE WITHIN A FAIRLY MOIST BUT CONDITIONALLY STABLE TO STABLE 
SURFACE TO 20 KFT LOWER TROPOSPHERE. IR SATELLITE IMAGERY DEPICTS 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN. TEMPERATURES HAVE FALLEN 
INTO THE LOWER 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. WINDS OVER THE 
ISLANDS ARE BETWEEN EAST AND NORTHEAST BETWEEN 5 AND 10 KNOTS. C-MAN 
STATIONS ALONG THE REEF AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE DEPICTING 
MAINLY EAST WINDS NEAR 10 KNOTS.

.FORECASTS...IN THE UPPER LEVELS(500 TO 200 MB)...TODAY THROUGH 
SUNDAY...UPPER LOW OVER EAST GULF AND ITS ASSOCIATED 200 MB 
DIVERGENCE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE WESTWARD ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO. 
THE UPPER LOW NORTH OF THE MONA PASSAGE WILL GRADUALLY MOVE 
NORTHWEST TOWARDS THE BAHAMAS. SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...HIGH 
PRESSURE NEAR THE CAROLINA PIEDMONT GRADUALLY EXPANDS IT SOUTHERN 
PERIPHERY TO OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS...KEEPING 20 TO 30 KT 
(500-200 MB) NORTHEAST WINDS. 

TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...A LARGE AND WARM ANTICYCLONE WILL REMAIN 
POSITIONED FROM THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES EASTWARD TO THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC OCEAN...WHILE THE KEYS REMAIN ON THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF 
THIS LARGE FEATURE...BENEATH LIGHTER BUT DRIER UPPER FLOW.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. WEAKENING 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION CHRIS WILL EITHER COMPLETELY DISSIPATE OR 
CONTINUE TO MOVE TOWARDS THE CUBAN COAST. WITH ABUNDANT MOISTURE AND 
LIGHT FLOW OVER THE ISLANDS...LOW TO MID LEVEL WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
BACK TO NORTHEAST...ALLOWING FOR A PRONOUNCED PERIOD FOR LATER 
MORNING AND AFTERNOON CLOUDLINES. HAVE INHERITED LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
TODAY. WITHOUT ANY ADDITIONAL FORCING OTHER THAN THE MESOSCALE THE 
MAIN SOURCE OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FROM 
CLOUDLINES...SO WILL HOLD WITH A LOW CHANCE FOR POPS.

TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...LATEST RUNS OF THE NAM CONTINUE TO

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS...
GOES-12 WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS TWO LARGE AND PRONOUNCED MID AND 
UPPER LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRCULATIONS...ONE OVER THE EXTREME NORTHEAST 
GULF OF MEXICO. THE SECOND FEATURE WAS CHURNING WEST SOUTHWESTWARD 
OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN...NORTH OF HISPANIOLA AND PUERTO RICO. 
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WEAK AND SMALL AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...WITH A WEAK 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE BARELY NOSING INTO SOUTH FLORIDA. 
MEANWHILE...DISORGANIZED AND ILL-DEFINED...NORTH-SOUTH ORIENTED 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION CHRIS LOCATED FROM THE EXTREME WESTERN TIP OF 
HISPANIOLA TO THE SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS CONTINUES TO MOVE WESTWARD. BACK 
AT HOME...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS 
OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS...WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING A FEW SHOWERS 
OVER THE DISTANT WATERS SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. OTHERWISE...OUR 
EVENING SOUNDING REVEALS A DISTINCT STABLE LAYER BETWEEN 950 AND 870 
MB...WITH A LIGHT AND CHAOTIC WIND FIELD BECOMING LIGHT WEST 
SOUTHWEST ABOVE 600 MB. 

OVERNIGHT FORECASTS:
WITH OUR AREA BETWEEN THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL GYRE OVER THE 
NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO AND LEFTOVERS OF CHRIS OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
GULF OF MEXICO...A RATHER STABLE THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT IS 
COVERING OUR REGION. GIVEN THIS STABLE AIRMASS AND ONLY A LIGHT 
EASTERLY FLOW EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVERNIGHT...HAVE ALREADY UPDATED

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE OFFSHORE 
WATERS SOUTH OF THE AREA FROM OCEAN REEF TO THE DRY TORTUGAS. 
ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY. 
WINDS OVER LAND ARE NORTHWEST TO NORTH NEAR 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON 
AVERAGE...ARE VARIABLE NEAR 10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 
80S. ONLY ABOUT FIVE DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO 
GENTLE NORTHEAST TO EAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES 
IN THE UPPER 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
AN UPPER LEVEL AREA OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR TAMPA BAY WILL MOVE INTO 
THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO TONIGHT. THIS WESTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE 
UPPER LEVEL AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL PULL ANY UPPER LEVEL 
DIVERGENCE NEAR THE KEYS TO THE WEST OF THE KEYS TONIGHT. WINDS MAY 
BACK TO THE NORTHEAST AT LOW LEVELS SATURDAY AS TROPICAL DEPRESSION 
CHRIS MOVES ACROSS THE NORTHEAST COAST OF CUBA. THAT MAY LEAD TO AN 
ISLAND CUMULUS CLOUD LINE FORMING NEAR THE KEYS SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
THE WIND FORECAST FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY WILL FOLLOW 
THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER WIND GUIDANCE. IF CHRIS REFORMS INTO A 
TROPICAL STORM...TROPICAL STORM FORCE CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE ON THE 
OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE KEYS FROM LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
SUNDAY. IF CHRIS PARALLELS THE COAST OF CUBA AS A TROPICAL 
DEPRESSION OR AN OPEN WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE...WINDS WILL BE LESS THAN 
ADVERTISED FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. CHRIS...OR WHATEVER IS 
LEFT OF CHRIS...WILL MOVE WEST OF THE KEYS LONGITUDE SUNDAY NIGHT. 
WINDS SHOULD BEGIN TO DECREASE SUNDAY NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REBUILD ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA MONDAY. A MINOR 
PERTURBATION EMBEDDED ALONG THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE ATLANTIC 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE MAY MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS SOMETIME MONDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY. AT THIS TIME...IT IS TOO DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN THE 
TIMING OF THIS FEATURE. THE AFOREMENTIONED ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE SHOULD EXTEND ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
FRIDAY. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN DEEP EASTERLY FLOW AND CLIMATOLOGICAL 
CONDITIONS TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. 

&&

.MARINE...
WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD BEGIN TO INCREASE SATURDAY AFTERNOON. MARINE 
INTERESTS IN THE FLORIDA KEYS THIS WEEKEND SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR 
THE PROGRESSION OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION CHRIS. WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE 
ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY.   

&&

.AVIATION...  
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE 
THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...INCLUDING THE ISLAND TERMINALS. WIDELY 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE LOCAL MVFR 
AND IFR CONDITIONS OVER THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...OTHERWISE ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND STORMS WILL AFFECT THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE TONIGHT. WINDS AT 
KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE VARIABLE THROUGH THE EVENING...BECOMING EAST 
NORTHEAST TONIGHT...BUT AT 10 KT OR LESS THROUGHOUT.

.DISCUSSION...
.ANALYSIS...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE THIS MORNING STILL EXTENDS OVER OR JUST 
SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND...BUT NOW APPEARS TO TILT A 
BIT WSW (RATHER THAN EXTEND DUE WEST) INTO SOUTHWEST FLORIDA. THE 
RIDGE REMAINS WEAK IN OUR AREA. AS A RESULT...KEYS AREA WINDS ARE 
DECIDEDLY LIGHTER...VARYING IN DIRECTION FROM ENE TO ESE...WITH 
ISLAND, BAY, AND REEF WIND GAUGES REPORTING SPEEDS ONLY AROUND 5 KT 
AT THIS HOUR. A SATELLITE SCATTEROMETER PASS THURSDAY EVENING SHOWED 
THE LIGHTER WINDS ON OUR GULF WATERS...BUT VERIFIED WINDS CLOSER TO 
10 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS AWAY FROM THE KEYS ISLANDS...AS WOULD BE 
EXPECTED. THE LARGE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW THAT HAS BEEN SPINNING 
JUST EAST OF FLORIDA...HAS MEANDERED OVER THE EAST CENTRAL FLORIDA 
COAST BETWEEN PALM BEACH AND CAPE CANAVERAL...AND IS PERHAPS SHOWING 
A DRIFT WNW ON SATELLITE LOOPING. RADAR SHOWS A REGION OF ENHANCED 
SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM FORMATION THE PAST FEW HOURS OVER THE 
STRAITS OF FLORIDA OFF THE SE MAINLAND AND UPPER KEYS. SATELLITE AND 
MODEL GRAPHICS SUGGEST THIS MAY BE AN AREA OF DIVERGENCE ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE WINDS AT HIGH LEVELS ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE LARGE UPPER 
TROPOSPHERIC LOW CIRCULATION. LASTLY...TROPICAL STORM CHRIS IS SEEN 
ON IR SATELLITE WITH SOME SPORADIC CONVECTION FIRING NEAR THE 
CENTER...WHICH THEN CONTINUES TO BE SHEARED OFF TO THE SOUTH OF THE 
STORM CENTER. THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOW LEVEL CIRCULATION IS EXPOSED 
AND IS EASILY SEEN ON IR SATELLITE LOOPING. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY...THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW IS FORECAST TO 
DRIFT WNW OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA TODAY...WHILE A WEAK REFLECTION 
DOWN AT 500 MB FOLLOWS OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. IF THE HIGH LEVEL 
DIVERGENT AREA NOW TO OUT SE IS PRESERVED...IT MAY TRANSLATE CLOSER 
TO THE KEYS WITH TIME TODAY. THE GFS SUGGEST SOME 200 MB DIVERGENCE 
SLIPPING OVER THE AREA. THUS...CURRENT POPS OF 40 PCT FOR TODAY WILL 
NOT BE REDUCED DESPITE THE GFS OUTPUT OF 30 PCT. THE GFS MAINTAINS A 
SLIGHTLY DRIER LAYER FROM 3 TO 7 FT AGL...WHICH THE NAM DOES NOT. 
(THE WET NAM SHOWS 60 PCT POPS FOR THE KEYS TODAY). THUS...40 PCT AS 
A COMPROMISE IS HELD ONTO. THE WEAK SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD STAY JUST 
TO OUR NORTH. MODELS SHOW LIGHT WINDS FOR BAY AND GULF...A BIT MORE 
SPEED (NEAR 10 KT) FOR MORE SOUTHERLY AREAS OF THE KEYS. NOT MUCH 
CHANGE IS SEEN FOR TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...WITH THE UPPER LEVEL LOW 
MOVING SLOWLY WEST FROM FLORIDA AND OVER THE EASTERN GULF. THE HIGH 
LEVEL DIVERGENT FIELD MAY STILL BE NEAR OR OVERHEAD 
TONIGHT...ACCORDING TO THE GFS MODEL. 30 PCT POPS WILL BE RETAINED. 
ONE NOTE...DURING SATURDAY AFTERNOON WINDS MAY BEGIN TO BACK TO THE 
NE AT LOWER LEVELS AS TS CHRIS APPROACHES EAST CENTRAL CUBA. THAT 
WIND PROFILE MAY AID IN AFTERNOON TCU/CB FORMATION OVER THE KEYS. IF 
SO...A LATER BOOST TO SATURDAY AFTERNOON CHANCE OF RAIN MAY BE 
NEEDED. 

SATURDAY NIGHT-SUNDAY-SUNDAY NIGHT...NHC FORECAST OF CHRIS WILL BE 
FOLLOWED FOR WIND GUIDANCE FOR THE KEYS. IF CHRIS MOVES ONTO NORTH 
CUBA...OR SKIMS ALONG THE NORTH COAST...A NOTICEABLE INCREASE IN 
WINDS SHOULD SET IN SATURDAY NIGHT...PERSISTING SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY 
EVENING. SIZE AND INTENSITY OF CHRIS WILL IMPART SOME OF THE WIND 
IMPACT ON THE KEYS. HOWEVER...MODELS SHOW A 4 TO 5 MB INCREASE IN 
PRESSURES OVER NORTH FLORIDA FROM SATURDAY TO SUNDAY...WHICH WOULD
TEND TO ENHANCE AND EXPAND WINDS ON THE NORTH SIDE OR EVEN JUST 
OUTSIDE OF CHRIS CIRCULATION. DEPENDING ON NHC GUIDANCE...A BIT 
HIGHER WINDS FOR LATE SAT NIGHT MAY BE REQUIRED...WHICH WOULD MAINLY 
BE FOR MARINE INTERESTS. AT THIS TIME...HIGH LEVEL WINDS THAT ARE 
CURRENTLY DEFLECTING CONVECTION SOUTH FROM THE CENTER OF CHRIS...
ARE FORECAST TO BECOME LESS STRONG...AND MAY TURN TO A FLOW FROM THE 
SE SAT NIGHT-SUN. IF SO...THAT COULD AID MORE CONVECTION ON THE 
NORTH SIDE OF THE STORM. I AM HOLDING OFF INCREASING POPS TO 60 PCT 
FOR SUN OVER THE KEYS...BUT ALL MODEL OUTPUT IS CURRENTLY SHOWING 60 
PCT (WILL KEEP 50 PCT AND SEE SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS). WE WILL NEED 
TO WATCH THE TS WIND RADIUS IN CASE IT IS FORECAST TO EXPAND INTO 
THE OUTER FLORIDA STRAITS. 

MONDAY-MONDAY NIGHT...A WET SE FLOW IS FORECAST TO BE OVER THE 
KEYS...WITH DIRECT EFFECTS OF CHRIS HAVING MOVED AWAY OVER THE GULF 
OF MEXICO. 40 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN IS REASONABLE. 

TUESDAY-THURSDAY...ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE IS SHOWN BY THE EXTENDED 
GFS TO GIVE A STEADY DEEP EAST FLOW OVER THE KEYS. NEAR CLIMO 30 PCT 
POPS ARE SHOWN. THE GFS DOES SHOW SOME LIFT DURING THIS PERIOD DUE 
TO ANOTHER UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH.
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD STAY NICE (EAST 5-10 KT FOR BAY AND 
GULF...NEAR 10 FOR ATLANTIC SIDE WATERS)...TODAY DUE TO WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE NEARBY. NEAR 10 KT FROM THE EAST SHOULD PREVAIL TONIGHT.
WATCH FOR A FEW THUNDERSTORMS AT ANY TIME.

SATURDAY WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO GO ENE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...
PICKING UP INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY 
FORM IN THE AFTERNOON NEAR THE KEYS. 

NOW...SATURDAY NIGHT THE EFFECTS OF TS CHRIS SHOULD BEGIN TO BE 
NOTICED OVER KEYS WATERS AS NE TO E WINDS PICK UP...MAYBE CLOSE TO 
20 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS...15-20 KT CLOSER IN TO THE ISLANDS. SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED FOR AT LEAST THE 
STRAITS...SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT CHECK LATER FORECASTS AS
THE ADVERSE WINDS COULD EXPAND OVER BAY AND GULF AREAS AS WELL. 
THERE REMAINS A CHANCE THAT SOME OF CHRIS STORM FORCE WINDS COULD
SCRAPE SOUTHERN EDGES OF THE FLORIDA STRAITS. ROUGH SEAS WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE PASSAGE OF CHRIS TO OUR SOUTH SAT NIGHT LATE THROUGH 
SUN NIGHT.  

IMPROVING CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY SET IN BY MON-TUE. 
&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. AN UPPER LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE ROUTE COMBINED WITH AMPLE LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL AID IN TRIGGERING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND WIDELY 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS MORNING AND IN THE AFTERNOON.

OF MEXICO. 40 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN IS REASONABLE. 

TUESDAY-THURSDAY...ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE IS SHOWN BY THE EXTENDED 
GFS TO GIVE A STEADY DEEP EAST FLOW OVER THE KEYS. NEAR CLIMO 30 PCT 
POPS ARE SHOWN. THE GFS DOES SHOW SOME LIFT DURING THIS PERIOD DUE 
TO ANOTHER UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH.
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD STAY NICE (EAST 5-10 KT FOR BAY AND 
GULF...NEAR 10 FOR ATLANTIC SIDE WATERS)...TODAY DUE TO WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE NEARBY. NEAR 10 KT FROM THE EAST SHOULD PREVAIL TONIGHT.
WATCH FOR A FEW THUNDERSTORMS AT ANY TIME.

SATURDAY WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO GO ENE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...
PICKING UP INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY 
FORM IN THE AFTERNOON NEAR THE KEYS. 

NOW...SATURDAY NIGHT THE EFFECTS OF TS CHRIS SHOULD BEGIN TO BE 
NOTICED OVER KEYS WATERS AS NE TO E WINDS PICK UP...MAYBE CLOSE TO 
20 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS...15-20 KT CLOSER IN TO THE ISLANDS. SMALL 
CRAFT ADVISORIES ARE EXPECTED TO BE REQUIRED FOR AT LEAST THE 
STRAITS...SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT CHECK LATER FORECASTS AS
THE ADVERSE WINDS COULD EXPAND OVER BAY AND GULF AREAS AS WELL. 
THERE REMAINS A CHANCE THAT SOME OF CHRIS STORM FORCE WINDS COULD
SCRAPE SOUTHERN EDGES OF THE FLORIDA STRAITS. ROUGH SEAS WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE PASSAGE OF CHRIS TO OUR SOUTH SAT NIGHT LATE THROUGH 
SUN NIGHT.  

IMPROVING CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY SET IN BY MON-TUE.

TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. AN UPPER LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE ROUTE COMBINED WITH AMPLE LOW

AT THE SURFACE A WEAK TROUGH THAT MOVED WESTWARD YESTERDAY...TO THE 
SOUTH OF THE KEYS...IS NOW VAGUELY SEEN IN SURFACE DATA FROM THE SE 
GULF OF MEXICO EXTENDING INTO THE YUCATAN PENINSULA. AS A RESULT...
KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING FROM A MORE SSE OR SE DIRECTION 
THAN WHAT MODELS HAD INDICATED FOR THIS TIME. MEANWHILE...THE 
ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE HAS SHIFTED SOUTH AS EXPECTED...NOW EXTENDING 
WEST INTO THE SOUTHERN FLORIDA PENINSULA. GRAND BAHAMA WIND IS 
TENDING TO GO S TO SW AT THIS TIME...SHOWING THE RIDGE SOUTHWARD
SLIP. KEYS AREA WIND SPEEDS ARE DOWN FROM 24 HOURS AGO...NOW RUNNING 
NEAR 10 KT AT THE REEF AND ON THE BAY...MAYBE STILL IN THE 10-15 KT 
RANGE THIS MORNING OUT IN THE STRAITS. SHOWER COVERAGE IS NOT GREAT 
AT THIS TIME...ISOLATED AT BEST. HOWEVER, SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED 
JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE OVER THE KEYS AND WATERS THROUGH THE NIGHT 
WITHOUT MUCH ORGANIZATION AND MOVED NW...WITH TOPS EVEN ON SMALL 
SHOWERS AT TIMES GROWING ENOUGH FOR A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES. 
SATELLITE SHOWS THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE LOW CENTER NOW OVER THE NW 
BAHAMAS...AND NOW SHOWING THE EXPECTED GENERAL WESTWARD MOTION. 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IN SWIRLS ARE SEEN ON 
SATELLITE OVER THE BAHAMAS AROUND THE UPPER LOW CENTER. TROPICAL 
STORM CHRIS NOW NORTH OF PUERTO RICO HAS WEAKENED AND IS MOVING IN A 
GENERAL WEST DIRECTION. ON GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY A BAND OF DRY AIR IS 
SEEN WEST OF CHRIS AND EAST OF THE DEEPER MOISTURE OVER THE NW 
BAHAMAS.

.FORECAST...
TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC (200-300 MB) LOW 
CENTER IS PROGGED TO LOOP AROUND THE NW BAHAMAS TODAY...THEN MOVE 
WEST OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA TONIGHT AND OVER THE EAST GULF OF 
MEXICO FRIDAY. THIS SYSTEM APPARENTLY HAS A REFLECTION DOWNWARD TO 
500 MB AS A WEAK LOW CENTER...LAGGING BEHIND THE HIGHER LEVEL 
LOW...AND FORECAST TO DRIFT WEST OVER SOUTH FLORIDA LATE TONIGHT AND 
FRIDAY. THE GFS MODEL SHOWS A SLIGHT COOL POOL AT 500 MB DRIFTING 
WEST OVER THE UPPER KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA TONIGHT AND FRIDAY 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW...WITH 500 MB TEMP -9C TO -10C. 
WITH FIELDS AT 500 MB AND 700 MB ARE WEAK HOWEVER...AND LATEST
GFS AND NAM MODEL RUNS DO NOT DEPICT ANY STRONG LIFT AREAS OVER THE 
KEYS. IN FACT...THE GFS SUGGESTS A SLIGHT DRY SLOT IN LOWER LEVELS
(SAY 3-5 THSD FT AGL) WILL STICK AROUND TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
DESPITE AN INCREASE IN MID LEVEL MOISTURE. AS A RESULT...GFS MOS
HAS LOWERED ITS CHANCE OF RAIN TO 40 PCT FOR DAYS AND 20 PCT FOR 
TONIGHT...WHILE THE NAM IS SIMILAR. AT THIS TIME...I WILL INDICATE
40 PCT POPS FOR TODAY KEEPING IN TUNE WITH THE GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE...BUT MAINTAIN THE PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED 50 PCT POPS FOR 
TONIGHT AND FRIDAY BASED ON THE HIGH AND MID LEVEL LOW CENTERS 
MOVING OVER...AND PERHAPS A BIT OF COOLING ALOFT. DURING THIS TIME...
THE SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD STAY OVER SOUTH FLORIDA...SO AREA WINDS
SHOULD BE 10 MPH OR UNDER FROM THE E TO SE. 

FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...THE UPPER LOW MOVES AWAY TO THE WEST...
AND MODELS SHOW A LITTLE MID LEVEL DRYING...OR AT LEAST LESS MOIST 
CONDITIONS. 40 PCT POPS WILL BE RETAINED. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...LATEST NATIONAL HURRICANE FORECAST 
ON TROPICAL STORM CHRIS INDICATES IT WILL MOVE WEST INTO EASTERN 
CUBA...HAVING REMAINED AT TROPICAL STORM STRENGTH...SATURDAY NIGHT
AND CONTINUE WEST OVER CUBA DURING SUNDAY...INTO THE GULF MONDAY. 
THE EXTENDED GFS SHOWS THAT THE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WHICH 
WILL EXTEND WEST OVER NORTH FLORIDA...MAY STRENGTHEN SLIGHTLY DURING 
THIS TIME FRAME. SO...WHATEVER LOWER PRESSURE MAY REMAIN WITH 
CHRIS...IS SHOWN BY THE GFS TO COMBINE WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR 
NORTH AND SQUEEZE THE BREEZE OVER THE KEYS MAYBE STARTING SAT 
NIGHT...PEAKING OUT SUN AND SUN NIGHT. AT THIS TIME...CONDITIONS 
LESS THAN TROPICAL STORM FORCE WILL BE INDICATED FOR THIS TIME 
FRAME...AND IF THE WIND FIELD IS OVERDONE FOR CHRIS...THEN 
THE CURRENTLY INDICATED 20 MPH OR SO WINDS OVER THE KEYS MAY BE TOO 
MUCH. 

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A DEEP EASTERLY FLOW IS SHOWN TO 
RETURN TO THE KEYS...WITH SOME MINOR PERTURBATIONS BUT OTHERWISE
NEAR CLIMO CONDITIONS. 

.MARINE...
WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE KEYS...
AN EAST TO SOUTHEAST WIND NEAR 10 KT SHOULD SET IN TODAY AND 
LAST THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. IF TS CHRIS HOLDS TOGETHER...A TURN
OF WINDS TO NE AND INCREASE TO 15 KT MAY OCCUR LATE SATURDAY OR SAT 
NIGHT. AT THIS TIME...BASED ON NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER FORECASTS...
WITH CHRIS PASSING WEST OVER CUBA SUN AND SUN NIGHT AND HIGH 
PRESSURE STRENGTHENING SLIGHTLY OVER NORTH FLORIDA...E WINDS OVER 
THE KEYS MAY PICK UP TO 20 KT...MAYBE MORE OVER THE SOUTHERN 
STRAITS. THIS IS UNCERTAIN...DEPENDING ON THE STATE OF CHRIS BY THE

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
335 PM EST WED AUG 2 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
A DEEP LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS IS 
MAINTAINING DEEP EASTERLIES ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS THIS AFTERNOON. AN UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC COLD-CORE CYCLONE IS 
MOVING STEADILY WESTWARD ACROSS THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. CONVECTION IS 
ONLY SLIGHTLY ENHANCED SOUTH OF THE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION... 
SUGGESTING THAT THIS SYSTEM IS PRIMARILY CONFINED TO THE UPPER 
TROPOSPHERE. MEANWHILE...GOES-12 VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGE LOOPS SHOW 
AN INCREASINGLY DISTURBED CONVECTIVE REGIME OVER THE NORTHWESTERN 
CARIBBEAN. AFTERNOON ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT DECELERATING TRADE WINDS 
MAY BE LEADING TO LOW-LEVEL MASS SPEED CONVERGENCE AND ASCENT. 

AT 200 PM EDT...TROPICAL STORM CHRIS WAS CENTERED ABOUT 100 MILES 
NORTHEAST OF ST. THOMAS IN THE VIRGIN ISLANDS...MOVING TOWARD THE 
WEST-NORTHWEST NEAR 10MPH. MAXIMUM SUSTAINED WINDS WERE NEAR 65 MPH. 
AN AIR FORCE HURRICANE HUNTER AIRCRAFT INVESTIGATED THE SYSTEM 
EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON AND REVEALED THAT CHRIS HAD NOT STRENGTHENED 
DURING THE DAY. THIS MAY BE DUE TO A COMBINATION OF DRY AIR 
ENTRAINMENT IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE AND SOME UNFAVORABLE WIND SHEAR 
ALOFT.

CURRENTLY...KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS MOVING 
WEST-NORTHWEST AT 10-15KT ACROSS THE WATERS SURROUNDING THE DRY 
TORTUGAS...WHILE A SUPPRESSED CONVECTIVE REGIME AND RAIN-FREE 
CONDITIONS COVER MOST OF THE KEYS AND ATLANTIC WATERS. STRONG 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE MOVING OFF THE SOUTHWEST FLORIDA PENINSULA. 

FORECASTS:
AS THE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE MOVES WEST OVER SOUTH FLORIDA 
TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...WEAK SYNOPTIC-SCALE ASCENT AND A DEEPER 
MOIST LAYER WILL LEAD TO RAIN CHANCES SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE. 
THEREAFTER...THE FORECAST WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE FUTURE 
EVOLUTION OF TROPICAL STORM CHRIS. DEEP RIDGING SHOULD REMAIN NORTH 
OF THE KEYS...SO IT IS UNLIKELY THAT CHRIS WILL UNDERGO RECURVATURE 
INTO THE MIDLATITUDES. HOWEVER...A MORE WESTERLY TRACK WOULD PLACE 
THE SYSTEM IN AN UNFAVORABLE LOCATION POSSIBLY IN THE VICINITY OF 
THE HIGH TERRAIN OF HISPANIOLA OR EASTERN CUBA. THERE ARE ALSO 
SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTIES ASSOCIATED WITH THE EVOLUTION OF WIND 
SHEAR IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE AND DRY AIR IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE. 

AS OF THE 1100 AM EDT NHC ADVISORY...THE CHANCE OF WINDS REACHING AT 
LEAST TROPICAL STORM FORCE IN THE KEYS DURING THE NEXT FIVE DAYS IS 
AROUND 25 PERCENT...AND THE CHANCE OF WINDS REACHING HURRICANE FORCE 
IN THE KEYS DURING THE NEXT FIVE DAYS IS AROUND 5 PERCENT. IF THE 
KEYS WERE TO RECEIVE A SIGNIFICANT IMPACT...THE MOST LIKELY TIME 
FRAME WOULD BE ON SUNDAY. RESIDENTS AND VISITORS ARE ENCOURAGED TO 
MAKE REGULAR CHECKS OF ADVISORIES AND FORECASTS FROM THE NATIONAL 
WEATHER SERVICE.
&&

.MARINE...
EAST-SOUTHEAST WINDS NEAR 15 KT ARE EXPECTED ACROSS THE STRAITS OF 
FLORIDA TONIGHT. LOOK FOR 10-15 KT ON BAY AND GULF WATERS. HIGH 
PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH IS EXPECTED TO SLIDE TO SOUTH FLORIDA TONIGHT 
AND FRIDAY...WHICH SHOULD DROP WINDS TO NEAR 10 KT THU AND FRI... 
BEFORE PICKING UP FROM THE NE LATER ON SATURDAY.

TROPICAL STORM CHRIS POSES A THREAT TO KEYS COASTAL WATERS WITH
INCREASING WINDS LATE SAT AND SAT NIGHT...WITH MAIN IMPACT EXPECTED 
SUN AND SUN NIGHT. MARINERS NEED TO WATCH THE PROGRESS OF CHRIS 
CLOSELY.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1027 AM EDT WED AUG 2 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
MORNING UPPER-AIR DATA ACROSS THE REGION SHOW A DEEP LAYER MEAN 
ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES...PROVIDING 
DEEP EAST WIND FLOW OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS. 
GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGERY SHOWED AN UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC 
COLD-CORE CYCLONE CENTERED JUST EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS... 
MOVING WEST. THIS CYCLONE IS STRONGEST AT 300MB...WEAKENING DOWNWARD 
TO 500MB. THE LOCAL AIR MASS HAS MOISTENED DURING THE LAST 12-24 
HOURS...PARTICULARLY IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE. THE AVERAGE MIXING 
RATIO IN THE MIXING LAYER INCREASED FROM 12.6 G/KG TO 16.4 G/KG FROM 
00Z TO 12Z. LATEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SERVICE AREA...WITH A MEAN CELL MOTION OF 
ABOUT 100/14KT. WINDS AT FLORIDA REEF AND BAY C-MAN PLATFORMS HAVE 
AVERAGED EAST-SOUTHEAST AT 9-13KT WITH GUSTS 14-17KT OVER THE LAST 
SIX HOURS. 

AFTERNOON FORECASTS:
CURRENT FORECASTS ARE ON TRACK. SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE 
WILL BE HIGHER THAN DURING THE LAST FEW DAYS...WITH A SLIGHTLY 
BETTER CHANCE OF RAINFALL OVER THE ISLANDS.
&&

.MARINE...
EAST-SOUTHEAST WINDS NEAR 15 KT ARE EXPECTED ACROSS THE STRAITS OF 
FLORIDA THIS AFTERNOON. LOOK FOR 10-15 KT ON BAY AND GULF WATERS. 
HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH IS EXPECTED TO SLIDE TO SOUTH FLORIDA 
TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...WHICH SHOULD DROP WINDS TO NEAR 10 KT THU AND 
FRI...BEFORE PICKING UP FROM THE NE SATURDAY.

TROPICAL STORM CHRIS POSES A THREAT TO KEYS COASTAL WATERS WITH
INCREASING WINDS LATE SAT AND SAT NIGHT...WITH MAIN IMPACT EXPECTED 
SUN AND SUN NIGHT. MARINERS NEED TO WATCH THE PROGRESS OF CHRIS 
CLOSELY.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND 
AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL TRAVERSE NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE FLIGHT ROUTE.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
500 AM EDT WED AUG 2 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AT THE SURFACE...THE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS ABOUT 
WHERE IT HAS BEEN THE PAST 24 HOURS...EXTENDING WEST INTO THE SOUTH 
CENTRAL SECTION OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. KEYS AREA WINDS ARE NOW 
BLOWING FROM THE EAST-SOUTHEAST...AND SPEEDS HAVE BEEN A FEW KNOTS 
STRONGER THAN 24 HOURS AGO...STILL NEAR 15 KT BUT VARYING AT TIMES 
TO 18 KT AT THE C-MAN 10 METER LEVEL. WIND GUSTS ARE MEASURED 20 KT 
OR SO AT ISLAND AND REEF LOCATIONS...AND MAY BE HIGHER OUT IN THE 
STRAITS. THERE HAVE BEEN NO OPPORTUNE SHIP REPORTS OR SATELLITE 
SCATTEROMETER PASSES SO FAR OVERNIGHT. BUOY 42056 IN THE NW 
CARIBBEAN SHOWS WINDS THERE HAVING TURNED TO ESE AS WELL...AND THIS 
SUGGESTS THAT A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH OVER CUBA AND THE NW CARIBBEAN 
HAS MOVED WEST AS MODELS HAD PROJECTED. THE TROUGH PASSAGE TO OUR 
SOUTH MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR THE SLIGHT BOOST IN WIND SPEEDS 
OVERNIGHT. ALSO...AN AREA OF INCREASED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
LIES EAST OF THAT TROUGH AXIS...AFFECTING CUBA AND EVEN SOME OF THE 
SE BAHAMAS. AT UPPER LEVELS...THAT LARGE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW 
CENTER THAT HAS BEEN SPINNING EAST OF THE BAHAMAS SEEMS TO BE MOVING 
IN A GENERAL WEST DIRECTION NOW ACCORDING TO SATELLITE LOOPING. 
GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY STILL SHOWS SOME DRY AIR ALOFT IN AN EAST TO 
WEST SWATH FROM THE FLORIDA PENINSULA TO THE NW BAHAMAS...WITH A 
GRADUAL MOISTENING SOUTHWARD TO THE FLORIDA STRAITS SOUTH OF THE 
KEYS. RADAR HAS DETECTED A SCATTERING OF SHOWERS OVER KEYS WATERS 
ALL NIGHT...SOME OF WHICH HAVE CROSSED ISLANDS WITH BRIEF RAINFALL.
EYES ARE CAST WELL TO OUR EAST-SOUTHEAST AT TROPICAL STORM CHRIS NOW 
SKIRTING THE NORTHERN LEEWARD ISLANDS...AND MOVING WEST-NORTHWEST. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...IN THE NEAR TERM OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS... 
MODELS STILL SHOW AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE DEPTH OVER THE KEYS. THAT 
LARGE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC LOW CENTER (STRONG AT 200-300 MB) IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE WEST OVER OR NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS 
THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP 
DOWNWARD...SUPPLYING A CLOSE LOW OR WELL-FORMED TROUGH AT 500 MB 
OVER THE REGION AS WELL...AND A TROUGH DOWN TO 700 MB. THUS...
A PERIOD OF ENHANCED POPS WILL BE CARRIED THU THROUGH FRI...AT
40 PCT...WHICH MAY NEED RAISING. GFS MOS CURRENTLY HAS 12-HOUR POPS 
RANGING 40 TO 60 PCT FOR THE THU-FRI PERIOD. MEANWHILE...THE GFS 
MODEL HAS BEEN CONSISTENT SHOWING THAT THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL 
TEMPORARILY SHIFT CLOSER TO SOUTH FLORIDA...AND THE PRESSURE 
GRADIENT SUBSEQUENTLY RELAXES A BIT OVER THE KEYS. BY THE WAY...
THE GFS SHOWS A LARGE EXPLOSION OF DEEP LAYERED LIFT AND LARGE 
PRECIP OVER WESTERN CUBA THURSDAY MORNING...WHICH EXTENDS OUT OVER 
THE KEYS...AND MAY BE A CONVECTION FEEDBACK PROBLEM. THIS FEATURE
DISAPPEARS BY LATER THU...HOWEVER MORE REASONABLE LIFT IS SHOWN
THU NIGHT INTO FRI ASSOCIATED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE UPPER LEVEL 
LOW.

FRIDAY NIGHT-SATURDAY NIGHT...NEAR CLIMO CONDITIONS (30 PCT POPS) 
WILL BE MAINTAINED...BUT THERE IS SOME CHANCE THAT A SE TO S FLOW 
OVER A DEEP LAYER SURFACE UP TO 700 MB MAY BRING IN MORE SHOWERS.
THIS FLOW IS SHOWN TO BE LIGHT HOWEVER. 

SUNDAY-MONDAY...SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT IS CURRENTLY THE TIME FRAME 
FOR MAIN IMPACT OF TROPICAL STORM CHRIS ON THE KEYS AND WATERS...
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER FORECAST. AS 
USUAL...UNCERTAINTY SURROUNDS THE TIMING, TRACK, AND INTENSITY 
FORECAST OF CHRIS THESE SEVERAL DAYS OUT...COMPOUNDED BY QUESTIONS 
OF WHETHER CHRIS WILL PASS CLOSE TO THE GREATER ANTILLES OR STAY
SUFFICIENTLY OFF THE ISLANDS FOR DEVELOPMENT. VARIOUS GRIDS 
INCLUDING WINDS ARE DIRECTLY RELATED TO THE CURRENT NHC FORECAST OF 
CHRIS CENTER PASSING WEST OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA NOT FAR OFF 
THE KEYS DURING SUN AND SUN NIGHT. 

MONDAY NIGHT-TUESDAY...HOPEFULLY A RETURN TO NEAR NORMAL 
CONDITIONS. 
&&

.MARINE...
EAST-SOUTHEAST WINDS NEAR 15 KT WILL PROBABLY GUST CLOSE TO 20 KT ON 
STRAITS WATERS THIS MORNING...STAYING NEAR 15 KT IN THE AFTERNOON.
LOOK FOR 10-15 KT ON BAY AND GULF WATERS. HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH 
IS EXPECTED TO SLIDE TO SOUTH FLORIDA TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...WHICH
OUGHT TO DROP WINDS TO NEAR 10 KT THU AND FRI...BEFORE PICKING UP 
FROM THE NE SATURDAY. 

TROPICAL STORM CHRIS POSES A THREAT TO KEYS COASTAL WATERS WITH
INCREASING WINDS LATE SAT AND SAT NIGHT...WITH MAIN IMPACT EXPECTED 
SUN AND SUN NIGHT. MARINERS NEED TO WATCH THE PROGRESS OF CHRIS 
CLOSELY.

400 AM EDT TUE AUG 1 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SURFACE WINDS OVER THE KEYS ARE FROM THE EAST...WITH SPEEDS NEAR 15 
KT AT C-MAN SITES ON THE REEF AND BAY SIDE...10-15 KT AT ISLAND 
SITES. GUSTS ARE REGISTERED NEAR 20 KT AT TIMES. THE KEY WEST 
DOPPLER RADAR WIND PROFILE SHOWS STEADY 15 KT EAST WINDS AT 1 THSD 
FT AGL. THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS WELL TO OUR 
NORTH...EXTENDING OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA PENINSULA. GOES 
SOUNDER IMAGES SHOW PRECIPITABLE WATER NOW ABOUT 1.5-1.6 INCHES OVER 
THE KEYS...WHICH WOULD BE UP A BIT FROM THE VERY DRY 1.3 INCHES 
SHOWN ON LAST EVENINGS SOUNDING. THERE STILL IS EVIDENCE IN 
SATELLITE DATA OF A DRY SWATH ALOFT EXTENDING EAST-WEST OVER THE 
KEYS FROM THE NW BAHAMAS INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. AT THE SURFACE 
IT REMAINS AS STEAMY AS USUAL FOR AUGUST...WITH LATE NIGHT TEMPS IN 
THE MID 80S...DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S. ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE 
DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS AND A FEW OF THESE 
MANAGED TO MOVE WEST OVER UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS LOCATIONS BEFORE 
DRYING UP. SATELLITE SHOWS A LARGE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE 
SPINNING OVER THE ATLANTIC EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. AN AREA OF 
WIDESPREAD CONVECTION OVER THE SE BAHAMAS AND NORTHERN CARIBBEAN 
SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MID AND LOW LEVEL TROUGHING WHICH 
EXTENDS FROM THE SE BAHAMAS...OVER E CUBA...THENCE SOUTH OVER THE 
CARIBBEAN JUST WEST OF JAMAICA. THE SURFACE TROUGH IS SUBTLE...
AND MOST CONVECTION LIES EAST OF THE SURFACE TROUGH AXIS. 

.FORECAST...
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE AT THIS TIME TO ONGOING FORECASTS. 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL SEE A GRADUAL INCREASE IN MOISTURE DEPTH OVER 
THE REGION...THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK LOW LEVEL TROUGH AROUND MID WEEK
...AND NOW THE EXTENDED PERIODS OF DAY 6 AND 7 (THAT IS NEXT SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY) ARE COMPLICATED BY THE EVENTUAL BEHAVIOR OF WHAT IS NOW
TROPICAL DEPRESSION 3 EAST OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS. 

TODAY-TONIGHT...A MOISTENING OF DRY AIR NOW ALOFT OVER THE KEYS 
SHOULD GRADUALLY SET IN. CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL REMAIN RATHER LOW 
TODAY AND TONIGHT DUE TO SOME RESIDUAL DRYNESS ALOFT...BUT FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES UP TO 1.7 INCHES BY 
LATE TODAY...AND 1.8 TO 1.9 INCHES LATE TONIGHT. THIS SHOULD SUPPORT 
ISOLATED CONVECTION WITH MENTION OF POSSIBLE THUNDER TONIGHT STILL 
IN ORDER. THOSE ISOLATED SHOWERS NOW IN THE STRAITS HAVE SENT A FEW 
TOPS UP TO 25 THSD FT...SO HIGHER TOPS TONIGHT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE. 

WEDNESDAY-WEDNESDAY NIGHT...I WILL DISCOUNT THE NAM MODELS HANDLING 
OF THE TROUGH NOW OVER THE NORTH CARIBBEAN AND SE BAHAMAS...WHICH
IT DEVELOPS INTO A SHARP SURFACE TROUGH WHICH IS CARRIED NW AND OVER 
THE KEYS DURING WEDNESDAY. THE GFS HAS A MILDER SOLUTION...SHOWING 
THE TROUGH TO SPLIT SOMEWHAT WITH ITS SOUTHERN EXTENSION BRUSHING 
SOUTH OF THE KEYS TUESDAY NIGHT...THEN A MORE SUBSTANTIAL (BUT NOT 
AS RADICALLY STRONG) NORTHERN EXTENSION OF THE TROUGH MOVING WEST 
OVER THE KEYS LATE WED OR WED NIGHT. THE GFS TRACKS THIS WAVE BEST 
AT THE 850 MB LEVEL...BUT SHOWS A TROUGH REFLECTION UPWARD TO 500 
MB. A PERIOD OF DEEPER MOISTURE AND SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WIND FLOW 
SURFACE UP TO 700 MB IS INDICATED FOLLOWING THE LOW LEVEL TROUGH 
PASSAGE. 30 PCT POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED...BUT MAY NEED UPGRADING 
IF SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS STICK TO THE PATTERN AND TIMING OF THIS 
TROUGH PASSAGE. 

THURSDAY-SATURDAY...DEEP MOISTURE IS SHOWN TO REMAIN OVER THE KEYS 
BY THE GFS. THE NAM TOO OUT THROUGH THURSDAY SHOWS MOISTURE AND LIFT 
OVER THE KEYS...AND HIGH CHANCES OF RAIN...BUT THE NAMS STRONG 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TROUGH (IT EVEN IS SHOWING A SURFACE LOW FORMING 
IN THE SE GULF) RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT ITS SOLUTION. AT ANY RATE...GFS 
MOS SHOWS 50 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN THU IN WAKE OF THE TROUGH PASSAGE... 
BUT HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT AND THE PASSAGE OF AN UPPER TROPOSPHERIC 
LOW CENTER OVER THE KEYS FRIDAY MOVING WEST ON SATURDAY...MAY GIVE 
SOME HIGHER CHANCE OF PRECIP TO FRI AND SAT AS WELL. 

SUNDAY-MONDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS MODEL DAMPENS OUT WHAT IS NOW TD 3 
BUT SHOWS ITS ASSOCIATED TROUGH OVER THE KEYS OR SOUTH FLORIDA 
SUNDAY. NHC FORECASTS WILL DETERMINE LATER CHANGES TO FORECAST FOR 
THESE TWO DAYS AS IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE FATE OF WHAT IS NOW TD3. 

.MARINE...
EAST WINDS HAVE BEEN RUNNING A FEW KNOTS HIGHER THAN OUR MODELS WERE 
INDICATING FOR NOW...BUT CLOSE TO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST AT ANY RATE.
THOSE EAST WINDS CLOSE TO 15 KT COULD BE A BIT GUSTY OUT IN THE 
STRAITS. EXPECT 10-15 KT EAST WINDS FOR BAY AND GULF WATERS. 
A WEAK TROUGH OR WAVE EXPECTED TO PASS THE KEYS AROUND WED SHOULD 
GIVE ESE OR SE WINDS THEREAFTER FOR A FEW DAYS. SOME SLIGHT DROP IN 
WIND SPEEDS IS EXPECTED BY THU AND FRI AS HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH 
SHIFTS SOUTH CLOSER TO THE KEYS. WE NEED TO WATCH TD3 FOR ITS FATE 
AND PROGRESS THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
OVERNIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS.

DOPPLER RADAR WIND PROFILE SHOWS STEADY 15 KT EAST WINDS AT 1 THSD 
FT AGL. THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS WELL TO OUR 
NORTH...EXTENDING OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA PENINSULA. GOES 
SOUNDER IMAGES SHOW PRECIPITABLE WATER NOW ABOUT 1.5-1.6 INCHES OVER 
THE KEYS...WHICH WOULD BE UP A BIT FROM THE VERY DRY 1.3 INCHES 
SHOWN ON LAST EVENINGS SOUNDING. THERE STILL IS EVIDENCE IN 
SATELLITE DATA OF A DRY SWATH ALOFT EXTENDING EAST-WEST OVER THE 
KEYS FROM THE NW BAHAMAS INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. AT THE SURFACE 
IT REMAINS AS STEAMY AS USUAL FOR AUGUST...WITH LATE NIGHT TEMPS IN 
THE MID 80S...DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S. ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE 
DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS AND A FEW OF THESE 
MANAGED TO MOVE WEST OVER UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS LOCATIONS BEFORE 
DRYING UP. SATELLITE SHOWS A LARGE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE 
SPINNING OVER THE ATLANTIC EST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. AN AREA OF 
WIDESPREAD CONVECTION OVER THE SE BAHAMAS AND NORTHERN CARIBBEAN 
SEEMS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH MID AND LOW LEVEL TROUGHING WHICH 
EXTENDS FROM THE SE BAHAMAS...OVER E CUBA...THENCE SOUTH OVER THE 
CARIBBEAN JUST WEST OF JAMAICA. THE SURFACE TROUGH IS SUBTLE...
AND MOST CONVECTION LIES EAST OF THE SURFACE TROUGH AXIS. 

.FORECAST...
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE AT THIS TIME TO ONGOING FORECASTS. 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL SEE A GRADUAL INCREASE IN MOISTURE DEPTH OVER 
THE REGION...THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK LOW LEVEL TROUGH AROUND MID WEEK
...AND NOW THE EXTENDED PERIODS OF DAY 6 AND 7 (THAT IS NEXT SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY) ARE COMPLICATED BY THE EVENTUAL BEHAVIOR OF WHAT IS NOW
TROPICAL DEPRESSION 3 EAST OF THE LEEWARD ISLANDS. 

TODAY-TONIGHT...A MOISTENING OF DRY AIR NOW ALOFT OVER THE KEYS 
SHOULD GRADUALLY SET IN. CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL REMAIN RATHER LOW 
TODAY AND TONIGHT DUE TO SOME RESIDUAL DRYNESS ALOFT...BUT FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES UP TO 1.7 INCHES BY 
LATE TODAY...AND 1.8 TO 1.9 INCHES LATE TONIGHT. THIS SHOULD SUPPORT 
ISOLATED CONVECTION WITH MENTION OF POSSIBLE THUNDER TONIGHT STILL 
IN ORDER. THOSE ISOLATED SHOWERS NOW IN THE STRAITS HAVE SENT A FEW 
TOPS UP TO 25 THSD FT...SO HIGHER TOPS TONIGHT SHOULD BE POSSIBLE. 

WEDNESDAY-WEDNESDAY NIGHT...I WILL DISCOUNT THE NAM MODELS HANDLING 
OF THE TROUGH NOW OVER THE NORTH CARIBBEAN AND SE BAHAMAS...WHICH
IT DEVELOPS INTO A SHARP SURFACE TROUGH WHICH IS CARRIED NW AND OVER 
THE KEYS DURING WEDNESDAY. THE GFS HAS A MILDER SOLUTION...SHOWING 
THE TROUGH TO SPLIT SOMEWHAT WITH ITS SOUTHERN EXTENSION BRUSHING 
SOUTH OF THE KEYS TUESDAY NIGHT...THEN A MORE SUBSTANTIAL (BUT NOT 
AS RADICALLY STRONG) NORTHERN EXTENSION OF THE TROUGH MOVING WEST 
OVER THE KEYS LATE WED OR WED NIGHT. THE GFS TRACKS THIS WAVE BEST 
AT THE 850 MB LEVEL...BUT SHOWS A TROUGH REFLECTION UPWARD TO 500 
MB. A PERIOD OF DEEPER MOISTURE AND SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WIND FLOW 
SURFACE UP TO 700 MB IS INDICATED FOLLOWING THE LOW LEVEL TROUGH 
PASSAGE. 30 PCT POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED...BUT MAY NEED UPGRADING 
IF SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS STICK TO THE PATTERN AND TIMING OF THIS 
TROUGH PASSAGE. 

THURSDAY-SATURDAY...DEEP MOISTURE IS SHOWN TO REMAIN OVER THE KEYS 
BY THE GFS. THE NAM TOO OUT THROUGH TUESDAY SHOWS MOISTURE AND LIFT 
OVER THE KEYS...AND HIGH CHANCES OF RAIN...BUT THE NAMS STRONG 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE TROUGH (IT EVEN IS SHOWING A SURFACE LOW FORMING 
IN THE SE GULF) RAISES DOUBTS ABOUT ITS SOLUTION. AT ANY RATE...
GFS MOS SHOWS 50 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN THU IN WAKE OF THE TROUGH 
PASSAGE...BUT HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT AND THE PASSAGE OF AN UPPER 
TROPOSPHERIC LOW CENTER OVER THE KEYS FRIDAY MOVING WEST ON 
SATURDAY...MAY GIVE SOME HIGHER CHANCE OF PRECIP TO FRI AND SAT AS 
WELL. 

SUNDAY-MONDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS MODEL DAMPENS OUT WHAT IS NOW TD 3 
BUT SHOWS ITS ASSOCIATED TROUGH OVER THE KEYS OR SOUTH FLORIDA 
SUNDAY. NHC FORECASTS WILL DETERMINE LATER CHANGES TO FORECAST FOR 
THESE TWO DAYS AS IT ALL DEPENDS ON THE FATE OF WHAT IS NOW TD3. 

.MARINE...
EAST WINDS HAVE BEEN RUNNING A FEW KNOTS HIGHER THAN OUR MODELS WERE 
INDICATING FOR NOW...BUT CLOSE TO THE OFFICIAL FORECAST AT ANY RATE.
THOSE EAST WINDS CLOSE TO 15 KT COULD BE A BIT GUSTY OUT IN THE 
STRAITS. EXPECT 10-15 KT EAST WINDS FOR BAY AND GULF WATERS. 
A WEAK TROUGH OR WAVE EXPECTED TO PASS THE KEYS AROUND WED SHOULD 
GIVE ESE OR SE WINDS THEREAFTER FOR A FEW DAYS. SOME SLIGHT DROP IN 
WIND SPEEDS IS EXPECTED THU AND FRI AS HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH 
SHIFTS SOUTH CLOSER TO THE KEYS. WE NEED TO WATCH TD3 FOR ITS FATE 
AND PROGRESS THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A LARGE RIDGE PARKED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES AND WESTERN 
ATLANTIC HAS MAINTAINED GENERALLY EASTERLY FLOW BETWEEN 5 AND 10 
KNOTS AT BOTH ASOS AND CMAN STATIONS OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
COASTAL WATERS. 00Z KEYW SOUNDING SHOWS MOSTLY EASTERLY FLOW 
THROUGHOUT THE ATMOSPHERE...WITH ABUNDANT DRY AIR ABOVE 2K FEET. 
SOUNDING PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE BELOW ONE AND ONE HALF 
INCHES...ANOMALOUSLY DRY FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. KBYX RADAR DETECTING 
A FEW SHOWERS EAST OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS...BUT OTHERWISE 
CLEAR. 

TROPICAL WISE...AN MID AND UPPER LEVEL LOW JUST EAST OF THE BAHAMAS 
IS CLEARLY EVIDENT ON BOTH INFRARED AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY. AN AREA 
OF DISTURBED WEATHER ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW...AND POSSIBLY AN 
ILL DEFINED SURFACE TROF...IS LOCATED IN THE VICINITY OF 
CUBA/HISPANIOLA/JAMAICA. ADDITIONALLY...A TROPICAL WAVE LOCATED EAST 
OF THE LESSER ANTILLES HAD SHOWN SOME EVIDENCE OF LOW LEVEL 
CIRCULATION ON 1KM VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY BEFORE SUNSET.

.TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...
NO CHANGES NECESSARY FOR PUBLIC OR MARINE PRODUCTS. NUMERICAL 
GUIDANCE KEEPS THE DRY AIR IN PLACE OVER THE REGION THROUGH TOMORROW 
SO ONLY EXPECT VERY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A CONTINUATION OF CURRENT 
TREND. MODEL MOS KEEPS POPS IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE FOR THE NEXT 
FEW PERIODS. NO TROPICAL CONCERNS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

.MARINE...
EXPECT MARINE WINDS TO CONTINUE EASTERLY BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS 
THROUGH TOMORROW. WINDS IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS BETWEEN THE LOWER 
KEYS AND CUBA COULD BE IN THE 15 KNOT RANGE THROUGH TOMORROW...AND 
WITH EASTERLY WINDS OPPOSING THE GULF STREAM COULD SEE SEAS HIGHER 
THAN 5 FEET IN THE GULF STREAM. OTHERWISE...ONLY MARINE HAZARD WILL 
BE ISOLATED SHOWERS...WITH THE SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF AN OCCASIONAL 
THUNDERSTORM.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
OVERNIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ONLY A FEW BRIEF 
LOCALIZED MVFR CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE 
MAINLY EAST AT AROUND 10 KNOTS OR LESS.

THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDS WEST TO CENTRAL FLORIDA... 
PROVIDING AN E...TO AT TIMES ESE...WIND FLOW OVER THE KEYS. THE MORE 
SOUTHERLY WIND GAUGES ARE SHOWING SPEEDS CLOSE TO 15 KT...OTHERS ON 
THE NORTH SIDE OF THE KEYS ARE 10-15 KT. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWED 
RELATIVELY LOW PRECIPITABLE WATER OVER THE KEYS...STRETCHING IN A 
SWATH TO ENCOMPASS MUCH OF THE NORTHERN AND EVEN CENTRAL BAHAMAS. 
SOME THIN CIRRUS FLOW HAS RECENTLY COME OVER THE KEYS...GIVING A BIT 
HIGHER PW. ON RADAR A NARROW CU OR TCU LINE IS SEEN MOVING WEST ONTO 
THE MID AND UPPER KEYS AT THIS TIME. IT MAY HAVE A FEW SPRINKLES IN 
IT...BUT OTHERWISE THE RADAR IS NOW PRECIP-FREE. 

.FORECAST...
TODAY AND TONIGHT...ON THE WHOLE...THE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH REMAINS IN 
CONTROL...DRIVING AN EAST BREEZE OVER THE KEYS AND KEEPING SURFACE 
HUMIDITIES HIGH. HOWEVER...MODELS AGREE THAT THE DRY AIR ALOFT WILL 
REMAIN OVER THE KEYS...ONLY SLIGHTLY ADDING SOME MOISTURE TO THE 
SURFACE TO 850 MB (APPROX 5 THSD FT AGL) LEVEL. MODEL OUTPUT ALL 
HAVE 5 TO 10 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. NO CHANCE 
WILL BE MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS...10 PCT TODAY AND TONIGHT. 

TUESDAY...STILL LIMITED MOISTURE DEPTH IS INDICATED. I WILL KEEP 
ONGOING FORECAST OF 20 PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...
BUT MOISTURE DEPTH MAY HOLD DOWN THE RISK OF THUNDERSTORMS. 

TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...MODELS ARE TENDING TO DAMPEN OUT 
TROPICAL WAVES NOW IN THE CARIBBEAN OR BRING THEM WEST MAINLY TO OUR 
SOUTH. MODELS SUGGEST A WEAK WAVE PASSAGE SOUTH OF THE KEYS EITHER 
TUESDAY NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY...BRIEFLY TURNING WINDS TO ESE BUT MORE 
IMPORTANTLY ENDING THE DRY AIR ALOFT NOW OVER THE KEYS...WITH A MORE 
TYPICAL MOIST LAYER FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 700 MB MOVING IN. 
WEDNESDAY MAY BE THE DAY WITH MORE SHOWERS SHOWING UP. 

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS SUGGESTS ANOTHER 
TROPICAL WAVE PASSAGE NEAR OR SOUTH OF THE KEYS AROUND SATURDAY 
NIGHT. THROUGH THIS PERIOD...SURFACE WINDS MAY FLUCTUATE FROM SE TO 
E...AND WITH SOME WEAKENING OF THE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WIND SPEEDS 
MAY BE A BIT LESS UNTIL THE WAVE ARRIVES. AT ANY RATE...A LITTLE 
DRYING ALOFT IS SHOWN PERHAPS FOR FRIDAY AND AGAIN AFTER THE LATER 
WAVE...SAY SUNDAY. NEAR CLIMO 30 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE CARRIED 
FOR EACH DAY AND NIGHT. 

.MARINE...
HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH SHOULD PRODUCE EAST WINDS 10-15 KT NEAR 
ISLANDS AND OVER THE BAY AND GULF WATERS...CLOSER TO 15 KT OUT IN 
THE STRAITS ESPECIALLY OVER MORE SOUTHERLY WATERS. A WEAK TROPICAL 
WAVE MAY PASS TO OUR SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY...TURNING 
WINDS TO ESE BUT AT THIS POINT NO INCREASE IN WIND SPEEDS IS 
SEEN...JUST AN INCREASE IN SHOWERS. THE RIDGE MAY WEAKEN COME LATER 
PERIODS OF THE WEEK...SO E WINDS MAY DROP A BIT THU AND FRI.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A LOWER TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE STRETCHES ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA. AS A 
RESULT SURFACE WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS HAVE BEEN EAST TO SOUTHEAST AT 
10 TO 15 MPH. STRONG MID TROPOSPHERIC SUBSIDENCE HAS CREATED A 
SUBSIDENCE INVERSION. THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED TWO DEGREE 
TEMPERATURE INVERSION BASED AT AROUND 3000 FT WITH STRONG DRYING 
ABOVE. OUR SOUNDING INDICATED 1.44 INCHES PWAT...WHILE MIAMI 
INDICATED ONLY 1.19 INCHES.  THIS INVERSION HAS PRECLUDED THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF ANY SHOWERS ACROSS KEYS WATERS...THOUGH THERE IS 
ENOUGH ROOM UNDER THE INVERSION TO PRODUCE A FEW TO SCATTERED RAGGED 
CU. 

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (OVERNIGHT)...
THIS LOWER TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE KEYS WEATHER 
OVERNIGHT. THERE IS JUST ABOUT ZERO CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION 
TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL FALL A BIT FURTHER INTO THE LOWER 
80S...WITH WINDS REMAINING EAST TO SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. NO 
CHANGES PLANNED FOR THE LOCAL FORECAST.

.MARINE...
THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO THE NORTH WILL MAINTAIN GENTLE TO 
MODERATE EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZE. THE OUTER STRAITS WILL BE SUBJECT 
TO THE TIGHTER PRESSURE GRADIENT ON THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THIS 
RIDGE...AND WILL HAVE WINDS NEAR 15 KNOTS. A FEW BOUNDARIES RUNNING 
ACROSS THE STRAITS MAY BE ENOUGH TO KICK UP A FEW BRIEF SHOWERS. 
WILL ONLY MAKE THAT ONE CHANGE TO THE MARINE FORECAST.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
OVERNIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ONLY A FEW BRIEF

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
THE 12Z SOUNDING SOMEWHAT RESEMBLES A WINTERTIME SOUNDING...WITH DRY 
AIR ALOFT AND A SUBSIDENCE INVERSION.  IT STILL HAS DEEP EASTERLIES 
THOUGH...EXCEPT FOR THE NORTHERLY WINDS AT AROUND 300 MB THAT ARE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL LOW TO THE NORTHEAST.  A HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE TO THE NORTH IS STILL BRINGING SURFACE WINDS FROM THE 
EAST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS OVER THE WATER...AND NEAR 10 KNOTS OVER 
LAND.  THE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS A LITTLE STRONGER OUT PAST THE REEF 
OFF THE LOWER KEYS...SO SUSPECT THAT WINDS ARE AROUND 15 KNOTS IN 
THE STRAITS.  WITH CONVECTION SUPPRESSED...THE ONLY INTERESTING 
WEATHER FEATURE IS HAZE FROM AFRICAN DUST.  

FARTHER EAST...THERE IS A TROPICAL WAVE IN THE MONA 
PASSAGE EAST OF HISPANIOLA.  THIS WAVE IS RATHER UNORGANIZED...AND 
ITS NORTHERN END IS BEING AFFECTED BY THE UPPER LEVEL LOW.  FARTHER 
EAST OF THAT...A TROPICAL WAVE IS LOCATED ABOUT 500 MILES EAST OF 
THE WINDWARDS.  

FORECAST:
THE FORECAST IS FOR THE DRY AIRMASS TO REMAIN IN PLACE UNTIL LATE 
TUESDAY...BUT THEN IT BECOMES MUDDIED...BECAUSE THE MODELS CANNOT 
RESOLVE HOW THE UPPER LEVEL LOW AND THE WAVE IN THE MONA PASSAGE 
WILL INTERACT WITH EACH OTHER.  THE GFS SEEMED TO HAVE A DECENT 
SOLUTION UNTIL THIS 12Z RUN...WHEN IT LOSES THE WAVE AND THEN MOVES 
THE UPPER LOW WESTWARD OVER FL WEDNESDAY.  THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF 
THE WAVE AT 850 MB...SITTING RIGHT UNDER THE 200MB LOW...BUT NOT 
MUCH AT THE SURFACE.  MEANWHILE...THE NAM MOVES THE UPPER LEVEL LOW 
EASTWARD...YET TAKES MOST OF THE WAVE SOUTH OF CUBA.  IN ANY 
CASE...GIVEN THE WAVES PROXIMITY TO CUBA AND THE UPPER LEVEL 
LOW...LITTLE DEVELOPMENT WILL OCCUR.  WILL SIMPLY TREND POPS TO 
CLIMO BY WED.  

THE WAVE EAST OF THE WINDWARDS SHOULD NOT BE A FACTOR FOR KEYS WEATHER 
THROUGH DAY 7.  

.MARINE...
THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO THE NORTH WILL MAINTAIN A STEADY EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST BREEZE...AVERAGING NEAR 15KT ACROSS THE STRAITS OF 
FLORIDA...WELL SOUTH OF THE REEF...AND 10-15KT ACROSS THE WATERS 
AROUND AND NORTH OF THE KEYS...TODAY THROUGH MID-WEEK. DRY...SINKING 
AIR WILL LARGELY INHIBIT SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT TODAY 
THROUGH MUCH OF MONDAY...BEFORE A MORE MOIST AND POSSIBLY MORE 
DISTURBED WEATHER PATTERN SETS IN BY WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGHOUT THE BALANCE OF TODAY 
THROUGH 18Z MONDAY. DRY ATMOSPHERE PRECLUDES MENTION OF SHRA IN EITHER 
THE TERMINAL FORECASTS OR THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE. STRONGEST 
ISSUE FOR AVIATORS WILL BE HAZE DUE IN PART TO DUST FROM WEST 
AFRICA. THIS WILL LOCALLY REDUCE VISIBILITIES TO NEAR 6SM BUT WILL 
LEAVE OUT MENTION OF MVFR VISIBILITIES AT THIS TIME. VISITING VFR 
PILOTS SHOULD USE CAUTION WHEN HAZE IS PRESENT AROUND THE TIMES OF 
SUNSET AND SUNRISE DUE TO THE SOMEWHAT AMBIGUOUS WATER HORIZON. 
SURFACE WINDS WILL CONTINUE OUT OF THE EAST...090 TO 110 DEGREES 
WITH SPEEDS 7 TO 10 KNOTS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS.$$

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
THE AIRMASS IS RELATIVELY DRY FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...WITH THE 12Z 
SOUNDING HAVING ONLY 1.53 INCHES OF PRECIPITABLE WATER.  THIS IS A 
RESULT OF SUBSIDENCE ALOFT THAT IS BEING CAUSED BY AN UPPER LEVEL 
LOW TO OUR NORTHEAST.  THE SUBSIDENCE HAS EFFECTIVELY SHUT OFF ALL 
CONVECTION ACROSS THE AREA...LEAVING AFRICAN DUST AS THE ONLY 
INTERESTING WEATHER FEATURE AFFECTING THE KEYS.  THIS DUST HAS 
REDUCED VISIBILITIES TO AS LOW AS 6 MILES AT TIMES.  IN THE LOWER 
LEVELS...SURFACE WINDS ARE EASTERLY AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS OVER THE 
WATER...AND NEAR 10 KNOTS OVER LAND.  THE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS A 
LITTLE STRONGER OUT PAST THE REEF OFF THE LOWER KEYS...SO SUSPECT 
THAT WINDS ARE AROUND 15 KNOTS IN THE STRAITS. 


FORECAST:
THE FORECAST FOR THE UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY THREE 
REGIMES:  1) A SUNNY...HAZY...AND GENERALLY RAIN-FREE REGIME TODAY 
THROUGH MOST OF MONDAY...2) A PARTLY CLOUDY TRANSITION PERIOD FROM 
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...WHERE THE MOIST LAYER DEPTH AND 
RAIN CHANCES GRADUALLY INCREASE...AND 3) A MORE MOIST...POSSIBLY 
DISTURBED...BUT AS YET UNCERTAIN PERIOD FROM WEDNESDAY AND BEYOND.

THE COMBINATION OF DRY AIR BELOW 850MB MOVING INTO THE SERVICE AREA 
FROM THE EAST...AND THEN BEING REINFORCED BY SYNOPTIC-SCALE 
SUBSIDENCE ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A STRENGTHENING UPPER- 
TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE WILL ENSURE RAIN CHANCES WELL BELOW AVERAGE 
FROM TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. THE TROPICAL WAVE CURRENTLY MOVING 
SWIFTLY WESTWARD ALONG 70W WILL LIKELY SPLIT IN TWO AS THE NORTHERN 
PORTION SLOWS DOWN AS IT APPROACHES THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A 
WEAKENING SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE. IN ADDITION...A LOWER- 
TROPOSPHERIC REFLECTION OF THE UPPER CYCLONE MAY FORM OVER THE 
BAHAMAS AROUND THE SAME TIME...SO THE SURFACE ANALYSIS IN THIS AREA 
MAY GET KIND OF SQUIRRLY IN A FEW DAYS. THE UPSHOT WILL BE THAT 
THESE PERTURBATIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED DEEPER MOIST LAYERS... 
CONFLUENT FLOW REGIMES...AND ENHANCED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL BE 
UPSTREAM OF THE KEYS...WITH SOME MODEL OUTPUT SUGGESTS A DISTURBED 
PATTERN SETTING IN AROUND WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY. HOWEVER...MODEL 
ENSEMBLES INDICATE A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH BOTH RAIN 
CHANCES AND WIND FIELDS. SUBSEQUENTLY...THE FORECAST WILL ADHERE 
CLOSELY TO CLIMATOLOGY FROM WEDNESDAY AND BEYOND.

.MARINE...
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE NORTH OF THE KEYS WILL MAINTAIN A STEADY EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST BREEZE...AVERAGING NEAR 15KT ACROSS THE STRAITS OF 
FLORIDA...WELL SOUTH OF THE REEF...AND 10-15KT ACROSS THE WATERS 
AROUND AND NORTH OF THE KEYS...TODAY THROUGH MID-WEEK. DRY...SINKING 
AIR WILL LARGELY INHIBIT SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT TODAY 
THROUGH MUCH OF MONDAY...BEFORE A MORE MOIST AND POSSIBLY MORE 
DISTURBED WEATHER PATTERN SETS IN BY WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY. POCKETS 
OF HAZE WILL BE AROUND TODAY...BUT SHOULD NOT REDUCE VISIBILITY 
BELOW ABOUT 5 MILES.  
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE AND THE 
KEYS TERMINALS THROUGH TONIGHT. EVEN ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE NOT 
EXPECTED TODAY. MOST SIGNIFICANT FLIGHT FACTOR WILL BE AREAS OF 
LIGHT HAZE WHICH WILL TEMPORARILY REDUCE VISIBILITIES TO NEAR 6 
MILES. THE HAZE MAY BE MOST NOTICEABLE APPROACHING SUNSET THIS 
EVENING AND JUST AFTER SUNRISE MONDAY. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND 
KMTH WILL CONTINUE OUT OF 100 TO 120 DEGREES THIS AFTERNOON AROUND 9 
TO 12 KNOTS.

405 AM EDT SUN JUL 30 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
DEEP EASTERLY FLOW PERSISTS ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA EARLY THIS 
MORNING. GPS-IPW TRENDS FROM GEIGER KEY SHOW A RAPID DROP IN TOTAL 
PRECIPITABLE WATER SINCE 00Z...WITH VALUES NOW APPROACHING 1.5 
INCHES. SATELLITE PRODUCTS REVEAL A LARGE SWATH OF EVEN DRIER AIR 
ALOFT OVER THE BAHAMAS...MOVING THIS WAY. REPORTS FROM STATIONS 
ALONG THE FLORIDA SOUTHEAST COAST HAVE INDICATED THE PRESENCE OF 
HAZE EARLY THIS MORNING...AND AUTOMATED STATIONS IN THE KEYS HAVE 
MEASURED VISIBILITIES AS LOW AS 6SM IN MARATHON AND 9SM IN KEY WEST. 
A FEW 06Z REPORTS RECEIVED FROM SHIPS TRAVERSING THE STRAITS OF 
FLORIDA INDICATED HAZE AS WELL. THE SAHARAN AIR LAYER TRACKING 
PRODUCT FROM THE UNIVERSITY OF WISCONSIN SUGGESTS THAT THE HAZE IS 
FROM A SAHARAN AIR LAYER. ANYWAY...KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS 
DETECT A FEW CLOUDLINES MOVING THROUGH THE SERVICE AREA...BUT NO 
RAINFALL ECHOES AT THE MOMENT. CURRENT AIR TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING 
IN THE MID-80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S...AND BREEZES ARE 
BLOWING FROM THE EAST IN THE 10-15KT RANGE AT MOST PLATFORMS.

AN UPPER-AIR ANALYSIS SHOWS UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLOGENESIS 
OCCURRING JUST EAST OF THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS...AS EQUATORWARD-MOVING 
CYCLONIC VORTICITY FEEDS INTO THE CIRCULATION FROM THE MIDLATITUDES. 
THE SYSTEM IS FORMING WITHIN AN UPPER TROUGH WHICH EXTENDS FROM THE 
MID-NORTH ATLANTIC SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR CUBA. IN THE MIDDLE 
TROPOSPHERE...A COUPLE OF ANTICYCLONES ARE ANCHORED ALONG A RIDGE 
EXTENDING FROM TEXAS TO THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC...WITH THE KEYS 
REMAINING SOUTH OF THE RIDGE. IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...A 
SUBTROPICAL ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC 
GOVERNS THE LOCAL FLOW...WITH THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CELL CENTERED NEAR 28N/60W. A FAST-MOVING TROPICAL WAVE WAS ANALYZED 
ALONG 70W SOUTH OF 20N...AND WAS ENHANCING CONVECTION IN THE 
VICINITY OF HISPANIOLA. 

FORECAST:
THE FORECAST FOR THE UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY THREE 
REGIMES:  1) A SUNNY...HAZY...AND GENERALLY RAIN-FREE REGIME TODAY 
THROUGH MOST OF MONDAY...2) A PARTLY CLOUDY TRANSITION PERIOD FROM 
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...WHERE THE MOIST LAYER DEPTH AND 
RAIN CHANCES GRADUALLY INCREASE...AND 3) A MORE MOIST...POSSIBLY 
DISTURBED...BUT AS YET UNCERTAIN PERIOD FROM WEDNESDAY AND BEYOND.

THE COMBINATION OF DRY AIR BELOW 850MB MOVING INTO THE SERVICE AREA 
FROM THE EAST...AND THEN BEING REINFORCED BY SYNOPTIC-SCALE 
SUBSIDENCE ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A STRENGTHENING UPPER- 
TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE WILL ENSURE RAIN CHANCES WELL BELOW AVERAGE 
FROM TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. THE TROPICAL WAVE CURRENTLY MOVING 
SWIFTLY WESTWARD ALONG 70W WILL LIKELY SPLIT IN TWO AS THE NORTHERN 
PORTION SLOWS DOWN AS IT APPROACHES THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A 
WEAKENING SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE. IN ADDITION...A LOWER- 
TROPOSPHERIC REFLECTION OF THE UPPER CYCLONE MAY FORM OVER THE 
BAHAMAS AROUND THE SAME TIME...SO THE SURFACE ANALYSIS IN THIS AREA 
MAY GET KIND OF SQUIRRLY IN A FEW DAYS. THE UPSHOT WILL BE THAT 
THESE PERTURBATIONS AND THEIR ASSOCIATED DEEPER MOIST LAYERS... 
CONFLUENT FLOW REGIMES...AND ENHANCED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL BE 
UPSTREAM OF THE KEYS...WITH SOME MODEL OUTPUT SUGGESTS A DISTURBED 
PATTERN SETTING IN AROUND WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY. HOWEVER...MODEL 
ENSEMBLES INDICATE A HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY WITH BOTH RAIN 
CHANCES AND WIND FIELDS. SUBSEQUENTLY...THE FORECAST WILL ADHERE 
CLOSELY TO CLIMATOLOGY FROM WEDNESDAY AND BEYOND.

.MARINE...
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE NORTH OF THE KEYS WILL MAINTAIN A STEADY EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST BREEZE...AVERAGING NEAR 15KT ACROSS THE STRAITS OF 
FLORIDA...WELL SOUTH OF THE REEF...AND 10-15KT ACROSS THE WATERS 
AROUND AND NORTH OF THE KEYS...TODAY THROUGH MID-WEEK. DRY...SINKING 
AIR WILL LARGELY INHIBIT SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT TODAY 
THROUGH MUCH OF MONDAY...BEFORE A MORE MOIST AND POSSIBLY MORE 
DISTURBED WEATHER PATTERN SETS IN BY WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY. POCKETS 
OF HAZE WILL BE AROUND TODAY...BUT SHOULD NOT REDUCE VISIBILITY 
BELOW ABOUT 5 MILES.  
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS 
WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 24Z. ISOLATED SHOWERS 
WILL AFFECT THE ROUTE...PRODUCING BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS...AND 
IFR VISIBILITIES IN HEAVIER CELLS. HAZE ACROSS THE AREA WILL REDUCE 
VISIBILITY TO AROUND 6 MILES IN LOCALIZED AREAS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. 
SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYS ISLAND TERMINALS WILL BE AVERAGE 
100/7-10KTS.

1030 PM EDT SAT JUL 29 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A LOWER TROPOSPHERIC ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS CENTRAL 
AND SOUTH FLORIDA. ALOFT...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IS WINDING UP OVER THE 
BAHAMAS. SURFACE WINDS HAVE BEEN RUNNING EAST TO SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 
10 TO 15 MPH ACROSS MOST ISLAND LOCATIONS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. 
THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED 1.9 INCHES PWAT WITH LOTS OF CAPE 
AND VERY LITTLE INHIBITION. ONLY A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
HAVE FORMED OVER THE KEYS...MUCH OF WHICH HAVE BEEN OFF THE UPPER 
KEYS AND OVER OUR GULF WATERS. THUS FAR...TEMPERATURES HAVE COME 
DOWN INTO THE MID 80S.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (OVERNIGHT)...
THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE DOMINANT PLAYER IN KEYS 
WEATHER OVERNIGHT. WINDS WILL BE EAST TO EAST SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 10 
MPH ACROSS THE KEYS. THE DEVELOPING UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL ACT TO 
LOWER MID AND UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE OVERNIGHT...WHILE DRIER AIR IN 
THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE IS ADVECTING WESTWARD ALONG THE SOUTHERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE ATLANTIC RIDGE. WHILE THERE HAVE BEEN A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER OUR GULF WATERS THIS EVENING...THE POTENTIAL FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE STRAITS AND THE KEYS IS FALLING DUE TO 
INCREASING DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT. CLOUD LINES AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES 
WILL KEEP A SLIGHT THREAT OF SHOWERS FOR THE KEYS OVERNIGHT. ONLY A 
FEW TWEAKS TO THE LOCAL FORECAST MAY BE DONE THIS EVENING.

&&

.MARINE...
THE ATLANTIC RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL DRIVE 10 TO 15 KNOT EAST TO 
EAST SOUTHEAST WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS WATERS OVERNIGHT. NO CHANGE TO 
THE MARINE FORECAST PLANNED FOR THE EVENING UPDATE.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
OVERNIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL 
AFFECT THE ROUTE...PRODUCING BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS...AND IFR 
VISIBILITIES IN HEAVIER CELLS. A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES ARE 
POSSIBLE...BUT DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AND THE EXTREMELY ISOLATED NATURE 
OF ANY SUCH STRIKES HAVE NOT INCLUDED THEM IN THE TWEB FORECAST AT 
THIS TIME. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE EAST SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 
10 KNOTS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SUBSIDENCE ON THE WEST SIDE OF AN UPPER LEVEL LOW EAST OF THE 
BAHAMAS HAS DRIED THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS FROM THE BAHAMAS TO 
CUBA...DELAYING AND POSSIBLY PREVENTING THE USUAL AFTERNOON 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THOSE ISLANDS.  IN THE LOWER LEVELS...A SURFACE 
RIDGE TO THE NORTH HAS MAINTAINED SOUTHEASTERLY SURFACE WINDS NEAR 
15 KNOTS ACROSS THE AREA.  A WEAK RIPPLE MOVING THROUGH THESE TRADES 
HAS CAUSED SOME CONVECTION OFFSHORE OF SOUTHEAST FL MAINLAND...WHILE 
THE USUAL AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORMING OVER THE GLADES.  

FURTHER EAST...A TROPICAL WAVE IS PRODUCING CONVECTION IN THE 
CENTRAL CARIB...NEAR HISPANIOLA.  EAST OF THAT IS A STRONGER WAVE ABOUT 
1000 MILES EAST OF THE WINDWARDS.  

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
ALL MODELS BRING DRY AIR ALOFT AND SUBSIDENCE ACROSS THE AREA 
THROUGH TUESDAY.  CONSEQUENTLY...GUIDANCE POPS ARE BELOW 10 PERCENT. 
HAVE GREAT DIFFICULTY GOING THAT LOW THIS TIME OF YEAR...BUT WILL 
KEEP POPS BELOW CLIMO.    

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
THE WAVE NEAR PUERTO RICO IS PROGGED TO AFFECT THE AREA LATE TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND INTO WEDNESDAY...BRINGING HIGHER THAN NORMAL CHANCES FOR 
RAIN.  GFS AND NAM DIVERGE IN HANDLING THIS FEATURE.  GFS AND THE 
ECMWF SEEM TO BRING SOME ENERGY NORTH OF CUBA AND INTO FL...WHILE 
NAM AND UKMET KEEP IN SOUTH AND BRING IT INTO THE YUCATAN.  WILL 
UNDERCUT THE GFS POP GUIDANCE UNTIL WE SEE SOME AGREEMENT.  

THE NEXT WAVE IS MORE INTERESTING LOOKING...BUT TOO FAR AWAY TO 
AFFECT THE FORECAST FOR THIS CYCLE...SO WILL SIMPLY CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR IT.    

&&

.MARINE...
LITTLE CHANGE IN WEATHER PATTERN EXPECTED UNTIL THE TROPICAL WAVE 
APPROACHES LATE TUESDAY.  MAIN CHALLENGE WILL BE WIND DIRECTION 
FLUCTUATIONS FROM NORTHEAST THROUGH SOUTHEAST AND SMALL WIND SPEED 
VARIANCES.  SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD INCREASE AHEAD OF THE 
WAVE ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WITH THE WAVE PASSAGE WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY.  
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AT KEYW AND KMTH 
TERMINALS THROUGH TONIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY. CURRENTLY WIDELY 
SEPARATED TSRA WITH ISOLATED IFR VISIBILITIES AND MVFR CEILINGS ARE 
FOUND ACROSS THE MAINLAND IN THE VICINITY OF KMIA WITH VFR ELSEWHERE 
ALONG THE KMIA TO KEYW ROUTE. AFTER SUNSET EXPECT ISOLD MVFR 
CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES IN SHRA. SURFACE WINDS WILL CONTINUE FROM 
090 TO 120 DEGREES WITH SPEEDS 8 TO 12 KNOTS WITH OCCASIONAL GUSTS 
UNDER 20 KNOTS.

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM ATLANTIC HIGH ACROSS CENTRAL FL.  
EASTERLY FLOW CONTINUES ACROSS THE KEYS AND STRAITS ON THE SOUTHERN 
EDGE OF THIS RIDGE.  SURFACE WINDS HAVE BEEN AROUND 15 KNOTS OVER 
THE WATER AND 10 TO 15 OVER LAND.  WITH THE EAST WIND AGAINST THE 
CURRENT...CONDITIONS ARE BORDERLINE SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE 
CAUTION.    SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY INDICATE SOME CONVECTION 
FORMING NEAR THE CAY SAL BANKS...ON THE NORTHERN END OF A WEAK 
TROPICAL WAVE MOVING OVER CENTRAL CUBA.  MSAS ANALYSIS A WIND SURGE 
IN THIS SAME AREA BEGINNING TO MOVE INTO THE KEYS WATERS.  

FORECAST UPDATES:
NAM AND WSWRF INCREASE THE CONVECTION AS IT MOVES WESTWARD 
TODAY...AND MAINTAIN OR INCREASE WINDS JUST A BIT.  WILL CONTINUE 
THE SCEC FOR THE AFTERNOON.  BEST CHANCE OF RAIN OVER LAND WILL BE 
OVER THE LOWER KEYS LATE IN THE DAY AND DURING THE EVENING.

&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZES SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO BE AT OR ABOVE 15KT TODAY. SEAS 4-6FT BEYOND THE REEF 
WILL CONTINUE...ESPECIALLY IN THE GULF STREAM...SO WILL CONTINUE THE 
SCEC. THE SURFACE RIDGE NORTH OF THE KEYS WILL WEAKEN SOMEWHAT 
DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. HOWEVER...THE RIDGE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF 
THE KEYS WHILE MSL PRESSURES FALL A FEW MILLIBARS IN THE 
CARIBBEAN...THEREBY MAINTAINING A DECENT GRADIENT THROUGH AT LEAST 
MONDAY NIGHT.
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...INCLUDING THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 24Z. ISOLATED 
TO WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH 
PASSING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WIND GUSTS OF 30 TO 35 KNOTS WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE STRONGER CONVECTIVE CELLS. OTHERWISE...SURFACE WINDS

419 AM EDT SAT JUL 29 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
DEEP EASTERLY FLOW PRESIDES OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS EARLY THIS MORNING...WITH A VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE IN THE LOW 
LEVELS AND A MODERATELY UNSTABLE STRATIFICATION ALOFT. GEOPOTENTIAL 
HEIGHT RISES HAVE OCCURRED FROM 1000-700MB DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS 
ACCORDING TO WFO KEY WEST RAWINSONDE OBSERVATIONS. THE MEAN SEA 
LEVEL PRESSURE AT 06Z IN KEY WEST WAS 1018.9MB...UP A FEW TENTHS OF 
A MILLIBAR FROM 24 HOURS AGO...AND ABOUT 2MB ABOVE AVERAGE FOR LATE 
JULY. RECENT SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGE LOOPS ACROSS THE REGION SHOW 
VERY SPARSE DEEP CONVECTION...WITH ISOLATED...SHORT-LIVED CONVECTIVE 
CELLS MOVING SWIFTLY NORTHWESTWARD NEAR 20KT.

AN UPPER TROUGH WAS ANALYZED OVER PORTIONS OF THE WESTERN NORTH 
ATLANTIC AND BAHAMAS...WITH A DEVELOPING CYCLONIC CIRCULATION 
EVIDENT IN GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGERY. OTHER UPPER-LEVEL 
CYCLONES WERE APPARENT OVER THE NORTHEASTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN GULF 
OF MEXICO...MOVING GENERALLY WESTWARD. IN THE LOW LEVELS...A 
SUBTROPICAL ANTICYCLONE WAS CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC 
WITH A RIDGE EXTENDING WEST ACROSS NORTHERN FLORIDA AND THE GULF 
COAST. THE TROPICAL WAVE TRAIN REMAINED SOUTH OF THE KEYS...WITH 
WAVES ALONG 77W...62W...AND 41W. THE WAVE ALONG 41W WAS THE MOST 
ORGANIZED...BUT STILL LOCATED OVER THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC SEVERAL 
HUNDRED MILES EAST OF BARBADOS AND THE WINDWARD ISLANDS.

FORECAST:
AFTER A DAY OF NEAR-AVERAGE RAIN CHANCES IN MOIST AND UNSTABLE EAST 
TO SOUTHEAST FLOW...THE CHANCE OF RAIN WILL FALL A SMIDGEN BELOW 
AVERAGE TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AS DRIER AIR WORKS IN FROM 
THE EAST AND SYNOPTIC-SCALE SUBSIDENCE ASSOCIATED WITH A DEVELOPING 
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE INCREASES OVER THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS. HOWEVER...FORECAST RAIN CHANCES WILL NOT BE AS LOW AS THE 
MOS CONSENSUS BECAUSE THE WIND FLOW IN THE MIXED LAYER WILL AVERAGE 
NEAR 20KT...RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT UPWARD FLUXES OF HEAT AND 
MOISTURE.

A GENERAL EAST OR SOUTHEAST FLOW IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE REMAINDER 
OF THE WEEK...WITH TEMPERATURES...RAIN CHANCES...AND WINDS ALL NEAR 
CLIMATOLOGICAL AVERAGES. SMALL-SCALE PERTURBATIONS IN THE EASTERLY 
FLOW AND FLUCTUATIONS IN LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MOISTURE...FEATURES 
WHICH ARE NOT RESOLVED WELL BY NUMERICAL MODELS...WILL MODULATE 
DAILY CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS.
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY FRESH EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZES SHOULD 
SETTLE NEAR 15KT LATER TODAY. SEAS 4-6FT BEYOND THE REEF WILL 
SUBSIDE SLIGHTLY TO 3-5FT...SO A FIRST-PERIOD CAUTIONARY STATEMENT 
WILL BE KEPT FOR ATLANTIC ZONES. THE SURFACE RIDGE NORTH OF THE KEYS 
WILL WEAKEN SOMEWHAT DURING THE NEXT FEW DAYS. HOWEVER...THE RIDGE 
WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE KEYS WHILE MSL PRESSURES FALL A FEW 
MILLIBARS IN THE CARIBBEAN...THEREBY MAINTAINING A DECENT GRADIENT

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE LOWER TROPOSPHERIC ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS FIXED ACROSS 
CENTRAL FLORIDA. ALOFT A TROUGH EXTENDS FROM NORTHEAST OF THE 
BAHAMA...ACROSS THE BAHAMAS AND OVER EASTERN CUBA. THE MASSIVE 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY WHICH SPED NORTHWARD THROUGH KEYS WATERS THIS 
AFTERNOON HAS LARGELY SWEPT KEYS WATERS OF ANY BOUNDARIES. AFTER A 
LONG BREAK IN CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ACROSS KEYS WATERS...CLUSTERS OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE FINALLY MAKING THEIR WAY INTO THE 
OUTER STRAITS. THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATES 2 INCHES OF PWAT 
WITH LOTS OF CAPE AND ALMOST NO CAP. THUS FAR...TEMPERATURES HAVE 
DECREASED INTO THE MID 80S FROM DAY TIME HIGHS NEAR 90.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (OVERNIGHT)...
THE RIDGE WILL REMAIN TO OUR NORTH OVERNIGHT...RESULTING IN EAST TO 
EAST SOUTHEAST WINDS AT AROUND 15 MPH ACROSS ALL KEYS AREA. THIS 
STEADY FLOW SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP ONLY A COUPLE OF DEGREES 
FURTHER INTO THE LOWER 80S. THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL THAT WEAK 
DIFFLUENCE EXISTS OVER OUR AREA...ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS 
TROUGH. THIS COULD SLIGHTLY ENHANCE THE USUAL NOCTURNAL/EARLY 
MORNING CONVECTION. TEMPS AND POPS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK. NO CHANGES 
NECESSARY TO LOCAL FORECAST.

&&

.MARINE...
THE PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL SUPPORT EAST TO EAST SOUTHEAST 
WINDS AT 15 KNOTS ACROSS OUR NORTHERN WATERS...AND 15 TO 20 KNOTS 
ACROSS THE STRAITS. WILL MAINTAIN THE SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE 
CAUTION OVER THE STRAITS. SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE MOVING WEST 
NORTHWESTWARD AT 15 TO 20 KNOTS. THEREFORE...ANY STRONG SHOWER AND 
STORM CAN PRODUCE LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS NEAR WARNING CRITERIA AND 
LOCALLY ROUGH SEAS. ONLY SUBTLE TWEAKS TO WIND SPEED TO OUR NORTHERN 
WATERS WILL BE MADE IN THE EVENING UPDATE.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
OVERNIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE IN COVERAGE ALONG THE ROUTE IN THE EARLY 
MORNING HOURS TOWARD SUNRISE...BUT SHOULD NOT EXCEED WIDELY 
SCATTERED AT ANY GIVEN TIME. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 10 KNOTS.

KBYX DETECTS WIDELY SEPARATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT 
THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. 
WINDS OVER LAND ARE EAST TO SOUTHEAST NEAR 15 MPH...WITH GUSTS NEAR 
20 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE EAST TO SOUTHEAST AT 15 TO 20 
KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 90 DEGREES. ONLY ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES OF 
COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO MODERATE EAST TO SOUTHEAST 
SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL DEEPEN NEAR THE BAHAMAS 
TONIGHT. A CUT OFF LOW PRESSURE AREA SHOULD DEVELOP IN THE BASE OF 
THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TONIGHT. A TROPICAL WAVE ALONG 73W SOUTH OF 
24N WILL APPROACH THE KEYS LONGITUDE TONIGHT. A MSAS ANALYSIS 
DEPICTS FALLING PRESSURE BETWEEN CUBA AND ANDROS ISLAND. THIS 
FALLING PRESSURE SHOULD CONTRIBUTE TO A TIGHTER PRESSURE GRADIENT 
THAN INDICATED BY ALL NUMERICAL MODELS FOR TONIGHT. THE CHANGE IN 
PRESSURE COUPLED WITH A DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO THE EAST 
WARRANTS AN INCREASE IN POPS AND WINDS IN ALL FORECAST PRODUCTS FOR 
TONIGHT. THE TROPICAL WAVE SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE FLORIDA STRAITS...
JUST SOUTH OF THE KEYS SATURDAY. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE AREA 
NEAR THE BAHAMAS SHOULD BEGIN TO WRAP A DRIER AIR MASS AROUND ITS 
CIRCULATION SATURDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES SHOULD FALL 
TO NEAR ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH SATURDAY NIGHT. PWAT VALUES 
SHOULD REMAIN NEAR ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH SUNDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY. DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THIS DRY AIR MASS...POPS WILL BE 
DROPPED BY 10 PERCENT FOR THE SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY PORTION OF THE 
ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS.   

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD BEGIN TO INCREASE AGAIN MONDAY NIGHT. A 
TROPICAL WAVE ALONG 55W MAY AMPLIFY OVER THE BAHAMAS MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY...BUT IT IS STILL TOO EARLY IN THE GAME TO BE CONFIDENT 
ABOUT THAT STATEMENT. POPS MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH FRIDAY...BUT FOR NOW CONTINUITY WILL BE MAINTAINED UNTIL 
FORECAST UNCERTAINTY DECREASES.

KBYX RADAR DETECTING ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE CWA MOVING TOWARDS 
THE EAST AT NEAR 18 KNOTS. OUTSIDE THE SHOWERS...CLOUD COVERAGE HAS 
BEEN GENERALLY FEW TO SCATTERED CUMULUS WITH BASES AROUND FL025. 
NEARSHORE MARINE WINDS HAVE BEEN EASTERLY NEAR 15 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS 
APPROACHING 20 KNOTS. ASOS STATIONS AT KEY WEST AND MARATHON HAVE 
BEEN BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS AND SOMEWHAT GUSTY. LATEST KKEY 
SOUNDING SHOWING ALMOST NO SHEAR WITH EASTERLY WINDS THROUGH THE 
TROPOPAUSE...AND SURFACE BASED CAPE OVER 3000 J/KG. FSL GPS BASED 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES HAVE BEEN BETWEEN 1.70 AND 2.00 INCHES 
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS. A TROPICAL WAVE IN THE VICINITY OF 
HISPANIOLA APPEARS POORLY DEFINED ON IR SATELLITE IMAGERY...WITH A 
BETTER DEFINED WAVE NEAR 50 DEGREES WEST...AND ANOTHER WAVE AND 
ASSOCIATED CONVECTIVE BURST NEAR 30 DEGREES WEST.

.TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
AFOREMENTIONED TROPICAL WAVE NEAR HISPANIOLA WILL PUSH INTO THE CWA 
LATER TONIGHT. BOTH THE NAM AND THE GFS HAVE THE WAVE PUSHING 
THROUGH WITH LITTLE DEFINITION...WITH THE NAM MOS GUIDANCE A LITTLE 
MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH POPS THAN THE GFS. OTHERWISE EASTERLY FLOW 
THROUGH THE LOWER PART OF THE TROPOSPHERE WILL PERSIST. 

.SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE DOMINATES THE OVERALL PATTERN THROUGH 
THIS PERIOD...WITH THE AXIS OF THE RIDGE IN THE VICINITY OF CENTRAL 
FLORIDA. THE GFS SHOWS A TROPICAL WAVE MOVING THROUGH TUESDAY...WITH 
A FAIRLY GOOD 1000 TO 700 MB LAYER AVERAGED STREAMLINE PRESENTATION. 
HOWEVER...IT IS FAR TOO EARLY TO SPECULATE ON THE IMPACTS OF THAT 
WAVE...IF ANY.

&&

.MARINE...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL KEEP 
EASTERLY FLOW BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS APPROACHING 20 
KNOTS...THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING. WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE OVER THE OPEN WATERS OF THE FLORIDA STRAITS. WINDS WILL 
LESSON TO EASTERLY NEAR 10 KNOTS SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY.

THUNDERSTORMS...WITH SCATTERED COVERAGE OVER THE MAINLAND PORTION OF 
THE FLIGHT ROUTE AFTER 17Z. WIND GUSTS OF 30 TO 35 KNOTS WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE STRONGER CONVECTIVE CELLS. OTHERWISE...SURFACE WINDS

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AN ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA. THE 
PRESSURE GRADIENT IN OUR AREA IS PROVIDING 10 TO 15 MPH WINDS ACROSS 
ISLAND LOCATIONS. TEMPERATURES SINCE SUNSET HAVE FALLEN INTO THE MID 
80S. THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED 1.88 INCHES OF PWAT IN A 
CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT WITH NO CAPPING. THUS FAR TODAY 
ONLY A FEW SHOWERS HAVE DIRECTLY AFFECTED THE ISLAND CHAIN...BUT 
THERE HAVE BEEN ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS KEYS 
WATERS THIS PAST EVENING. MOST OF THE CURRENT ACTIVITY...INITIATED 
OVER THE BAHAMAS EARLIER TODAY...HAS BEEN MOVING WESTWARD AT 15 TO 
20 MPH ACROSS THE STRAITS THIS EVENING.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (OVERNIGHT)...
THE ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BE THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE 
ACROSS OUR AREA THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. WINS WILL REMAIN EAST 
TO EAST SOUTHEASTERLY AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS. MOST OF THE SHOWERS THAT 
HAVE APPROACHED THE ISLAND CHAIN THIS EVENING HAVE 
DISSIPATED...HOWEVER THE CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MOVING WESTWARD OVER THE STRAITS HAVE A GOOD CHANCE OF AFFECTING AT 
LEAST SOME OF THE KEYS. THE ONGOING FORECAST APPEARS ON 
TRACK...THEREFORE NO CHANGES PLANNED FOR THE EVENING UPDATE.

&&

.MARINE...
THE ATLANTIC RIDGE ESTABLISHED ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA WILL MAINTAIN 
MODERATE EAST WINDS ACROSS KEYS WATERS OVERNIGHT. NO CHANGES TO THE 
MARINE PACKAGE PLANNED FOR THE EVENING UPDATE.

&&

.AVIATION...
A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FOUND OVER THE WATER 
TONIGHT...AND THEN OVER LAND DURING THE AFTERNOON...OTHERWISE VFR

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH AND 
WEST OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 90 DEGREES. ONLY 
ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO GENTLE 
EAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA 
WILL DISSIPATE TONIGHT. MEANWHILE...IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS 
NORTH FLORIDA TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES 
WILL REMAIN NEAR OR JUST BELOW TWO INCHES TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. 
DESPITE LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT...ABUNDANT ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY IN PLACE WARRANTS LOW CHANCE POPS FOR TONIGHT AND 
FRIDAY. A TROPICAL WAVE IN THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN SEA SOUTH OF 23N 
WILL MOVE TO THE WEST AT AROUND 15 KNOTS TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY. 
AT THIS SPEED OF MOVEMENT...THE TROPICAL WAVE SHOULD APPROACH THE 
KEYS LATITUDE BY FRIDAY NIGHT. UPPER LEVEL WINDS IN THE CARIBBEAN 
SEA ARE HIGHLY UNFAVORABLE FOR THIS TROPICAL WAVE TO DEVELOP 
FURTHER. THEREFORE...THE NORTHERN EXTENT OF THIS TROPICAL WAVE 
SHOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF 23N AND PASS SOUTH OF THE KEYS FRIDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY. THIS TROPICAL WAVE WILL HAVE LITTLE TO NO EFFECT 
ON THE LOCAL WEATHER FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. IN THE WAKE OF THIS 
TROPICAL WAVE...A DRIER AIR MASS IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER THE KEYS 
SATURDAY NIGHT. PWAT VALUES SHOULD FALL TO JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE 
HALF OF AN INCH SATURDAY NIGHT. DUE TO THIS EXPECTED DRYING...POPS 
WILL BE DROPPED BY 10 PERCENT FOR SATURDAY NIGHT.   

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A LARGE TROPICAL WAVE IS LOCATED ALONG 47W SOUTH OF 22N. THIS 
TROPICAL WAVE WILL MOVE TO THE WEST NEAR 15 KNOTS OVER THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS. AT THIS PACE OF MOVEMENT...THE TROPICAL WAVE WILL BE 
CLOSE TO HISPANIOLA SUNDAY. WINDS IN THE EASTERN CARIBBEAN SEA MAY 
BE MORE CONDUCIVE FOR AMPLIFICATION OR TROPICAL CYCLONE DEVELOPMENT 
LATE THIS WEEKEND...BUT IT IS TOO EARLY IN THE GAME TO BE CONFIDENT 
ABOUT THAT STATEMENT. DUE TO A HIGH DEGREE OF FORECAST 
UNCERTAINTY...THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE 
FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE BASED ON CLIMATOLOGY.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST NEAR 15 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 80S. ONLY ABOUT 
FIVE DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO GENTLE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (TODAY)...
IN THE LOW LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA TODAY. IN THE MID LEVELS 
OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER 
SOUTHERN GEORGIA TODAY. IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...IT 
IS FAIRLY OBVIOUS FROM HAND ANALYSIS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY THAT A 
LENGTHY TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE EXTENDS SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC FROM LOW PRESSURE EAST OF NEW ENGLAND. THE TAIL END OF THIS 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE IS LOCATED NEAR VERO BEACH. THE NUMERICAL 
MODEL GUIDANCE DIFFER REGARDING THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE TODAY. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE 
DEPICTS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE REMAINING STATIONARY 
TODAY. MEANWHILE...THE NAM/WRF NUMERICAL MODEL GUIDANCE DEPICTS THE 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE SAGGING SOUTHWARD INTO SOUTH 
FLORIDA TODAY. AS A RESULT...THE NAM/WRF NUMERICAL MODEL OUTPUT 
STATISTICS INDICATE LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS FOR THE SERVICE AREA 
TODAY. THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE LOOKS TO BE TOO WEAK 
TO PUSH SOUTHWARD TODAY. THEREFORE...THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL 
GUIDANCE SOLUTION SEEMS MORE REASONABLE FOR TODAY. LOW CHANCE POPS 
WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR TODAY...WHICH IS NEAR ALL NUMERICAL MODEL 
OUTPUT STATISTICS...EXCEPT WELL UNDER THE NAM/WRF NUMERICAL MODEL 
OUTPUT STATISTICS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
330 AM EDT THU JUL 27 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
AN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE STRETCHES ACROSS CENTRAL 
FLORIDA AND INTO THE NORTHEASTERN GULF...WITH A WEAKNESS OVER THE 
MAINLAND DUE TO LINGERING EFFECTS OF AFTERNOON HEATING. THE KEYS AND 
SURROUNDING WATERS LIE ON THE EDGE OF THE GRADIENT TO THE SOUTH OF 
THE RIDGE...RESULTING IN MAINLY EAST WINDS NEAR 10 MPH ON LAND AND 
10 TO 15 KNOTS ON THE REEF...AND NEAR 15 KNOTS IN THE OFFSHORE 
ATLANTIC WATERS. KBYX RADAR DETECTS ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE STRAITS OFF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE HOVERING IN THE LOW TO MID 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
THE MID 70S UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.

FORECAST:
THE RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER CENTRAL AND NORTHERN FLORIDA WELL INTO 
NEXT WEEK...WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN OVERALL CONDITIONS EXPECTED IN THE 
KEYS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. A WESTWARD TROPICAL WAVE MAY PASS SOUTH 
OF THE AREA LATER IN THE WEEKEND.

TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL REMAIN TO OUR 
NORTH RESULTING IN MAINLY EAST WINDS OVER THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS. THE MODELS INDICATE PERIODS OF SLIGHTLY HIGHER AND LOWER 
WIND SPEEDS BASED ON SMALL RIPPLES IN THE LOW-LEVEL PRESSURE 
FIELD...BUT THESE SUBTLE FEATURES ARE DIFFICULT FOR THE MODELS TO 
ACCURATELY DETECT AND RESOLVE...AND FOR THE MOST PART WINDS SHOULD 
BE PRETTY CONSISTENT. THERE MAY BE SLIGHTLY LOWER SPEEDS IN THE 
AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS DUE TO THERMAL TROUGHING OVER THE 
MAINLAND...BUT THIS WOULD BE A SMALL EFFECT OF ONLY A FEW KNOTS. 
CLOUD LINES WILL BE POSSIBLE EACH DAY BUT THE EASTERLY FLOW SHOULD 
KEEP THEM NORTH OF THE ISLANDS. WILL KEEP NEAR CLIMO POPS OF 30 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD.

SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THE MODELS CONTINUE TO TAKE THE TROPICAL 
WAVE CURRENTLY APPROACHING PUERTO RICO WESTWARD AND CLOSER TO US BY 
SUNDAY. HOWEVER...WHEREAS LAST NIGHT THE GFS AND NAM BROUGHT THE 
WAVE THROUGH THE BAHAMAS AND VERY NEAR FLORIDA...TONIGHT THEY ARE 
TAKING IT SOUTH OF CUBA THROUGH THE CARIBBEAN. IT REMAINS TO BE SEEN 
WHAT EFFECT THIS SYSTEM WILL HAVE ON OUR AREA...BUT EVEN IF IT 
PASSES WELL SOUTH OF US IT MAY PLACE THE KEYS IN A REGION OF 
INCREASED MOISTURE AND LIFT BOTH AS THE WAVE PASSES AND AFTERWARD. 
THUS WILL MAINTAIN THE 40 POPS INHERITED FOR THIS PERIOD. IF THE 
WAVE PASSES FAR ENOUGH SOUTH OF US THAT WE ARE OUTSIDE ITS 
INFLUENCE...WOULD EXPECT THE EASTERLY WINDS AND CLIMO POPS OF THE 
PRECEDING SEVERAL DAYS TO CONTINUE.

&&

.MARINE...
WITH AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
FLORIDA FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...EASTERLY WINDS WILL PREVAIL OVER 
FLORIDA KEYS WATERS AT LEAST THROUGH SATURDAY. SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN 
SPEED WILL OCCUR...BUT GENERALLY WINDS WILL BE NEAR 15 KNOTS ON THE 
ATLANTIC AND 10 TO 15 KNOTS ON THE BAY AND GULF. NO CAUTIONARY OR 
ADVISORIES HEADLINES ARE ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME.

&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREDOMINATE ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST  
FLIGHT ROUTE...WITH ISOLD MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. CELL MOVEMENT OF 10012KT APPEARS LIKELY 
WITH MOST ACTIVITY. OTHERWISE...EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS OF AROUND 10 
KNOTS CAN BE EXPECTED AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS.

&&

.PRELIMINARY POINT TEMPS/POPS...
KEY WEST  89/82/89/81/90 30/30/30/30/30

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS:
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CONTINUES ACROSS THE CENTRAL PENINSULA 
THROUGH THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF COAST...INDENTED DUE TO DIURNAL HEAT 
TROUGHING ACROSS SOUTHWEST FLORIDA. IN THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS...A 
BROAD RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS THE NORTH GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH THE 
CENTRAL FLORIDA PENINSULA. THIS HAS ALLOWED STRONG NORTHEAST FLOW 
ABOVE 300 MB TO CONTINUE OVER THE SOUTHEAST GULF. A WEST COAST 
SEABREEZE CIRCULATION HAD DEVELOPED WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM 
SOUTHWEST OF EVERGLADES CITY PROPAGATING TO THE SOUTHWEST. EVENING 
SOUNDING STILL LOOKS SIMILAR TO PAST SEVERAL SOUNDINGS 
THERMODYNAMICALLY. PRECIPITABLE WATER IS AROUND 1.7 TO 1.85 INCHES 
PER SOUNDING AND GEIGER KEY GPS IPW OBSERVATIONS. GOES SOUNDER 
ESTIMATES DRIER DEEP LAYER AIR WITH PW NEAR 1.5 INCHES IN THE 
CENTRAL BAHAMAS...BUT THERE APPEARS TO BE MORE CUMULUS GROWTH UNDER 
THAT REGION. WIND PROFILE HAS BECOME A LITTLE SOUTH OF DUE EAST IN 
THE FIRST 6K FEET OFF THE SURFACE...EAST TO EAST NORTHEAST THROUGH 
THE REMAINDER OF THE TROPOSPHERE. SURFACE WINDS ARE EAST TO EAST 
SOUTHEAST AROUND 10 KNOTS ACROSS THE ISLANDS AND COASTAL WATERS. AS 
OF 930 PM...ECHOES ON THE KBYX RADAR SOUTHWEST OF KEY WEST THROUGH 
DRY TORTUGAS ARE CHAFF AND NOT PRECIPITATION. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE OCCURRING WITHIN 20 NM OF OCEAN REEF AND DRIFTING 
WEST.

FORECAST:
DEEP EASTERLY FLOW WOULD WARRANT CLIMO POPS OVERNIGHT. UNLIKE LAST 
EVENING THERE ARE NO SIGNIFICANT ECHOES STREAMING OFF ANDROS ISLAND. 
WAS ACTUALLY TEMPTED TO REDUCE POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THE 
OVERNIGHT...BUT DRIER AIR ACROSS THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS WILL NOT MAKE 
IT SUFFICIENTLY INTO THE KEYS IN TIME TO SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE THE
NOCTURNAL CONVECTIVE COVERAGE. CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT TAKES PLACE IN 
THE STRAITS IN THE NEXT HOUR OR SO. OTHERWISE TEMPS AND WINDS LOOK 
FINE FOR THE OVERNIGHT.
&&

.MARINE...
EAST WINDS ARE NEAR 10 KNOTS BUT A LITTLE GUSTY...GUSTS TO OVER 15 
KNOTS AT TIMES AT SAND KEY. IT APPEARS IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE MORE 
TIME FOR WINDS TO INCREASE. PLAN ON DELAYING ANY WIND INCREASE TO 
AFTER TONIGHT...AND INDICATE 10 TO 15 KNOTS FOR THE COASTAL WATERS 
OVERNIGHT.
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST  
FLIGHT ROUTE...AND AT ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. THE MAIN THREAT TO 
AVIATION WILL BE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MOVING 
WESTWARD ACROSS THE ROUTE AT 15 KNOTS. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS:
A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CONTINUES EXTEND WEST INTO CENTRAL 
FLORIDA...DRIVING THE KEYS AREA WIND FLOW FROM THE EAST. WIND SPEEDS 
HAVE COME DOWN A FEW KNOTS OVER KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS THIS 
AFTERNOON...LIKELY DUE TO THERMAL TROUGHING OVER THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA. A FLARE-UP IN MORNING SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
LASTED UNTIL ABOUT NOON...THEN COVERAGE FADED OVER OUR ATLANTIC 
WATERS. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS PERSISTED OVER 
GULF WATERS DUE TO CONVECTION HAVING FORMED AND MOVED WEST OFF THE 
MAINLAND. AT THIS HOUR HOWEVER...LITTLE CONVECTION IS OCCURRING OVER 
THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND. A GENERALLY SUMMER TIME FAIR WEATHER 
PATTERN IS STILL EVIDENT TO OUR EAST OVER THE NW AND CENTRAL BAHAMAS.
CONVECTION OVER EASTERN CUBA AND THE NW CARIBBEAN IS ASSOCIATED IN 
PART WITH AN UPPER LEVEL LOW THAT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE WEST AND STAY 
WELL SOUTH OF THE KEYS. LOOKING FARTHER BEYOND THE SE HORIZON...
A WELL-DEFINED TROPICAL WAVE IS STILL SEEN ENTERING THE NE CARIBBEAN 
AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC WATERS...AND IT HAS A BIT MORE CONVECTION THAN 
PREVIOUSLY ALTHOUGH THERE IS NO LONGER A SATELLITE SIGNATURE OF THE 
PREVIOUS LOW LEVEL CYCLONIC SWIRL. A WIND SURGE WITH LOTS OF AFRICAN 
DUST IS SEEN ON SATELLITE NORTH AND EAST OF THE WAVE. 

FORECAST:
TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT THE 
RIDGE TO OUR NORTH (BOTH AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT) WILL KEEP A DEEP 
EASTERLY FLOW COMING OVER THE KEYS. SURFACE WINDS ARE SHOWN IN THE 
GFS MODEL TO RISE AGAIN TO NEAR 15 KT AND STAY THAT WAY MOST OF THE 
TIME EXCEPT FOR BRIEF AFTERNOON PERIODS OF SLIGHTLY LESSER WIND 
SPEEDS. THE NAM MODEL SHOWS WINDS INCREASING TO 15 KT OVER THE AREA 
THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS PATTERN TYPICALLY LEANS TOWARD A LATE NIGHT AND 
MORNING FAVORED TIME FOR OCEAN SHOWERS TO FORM...AND THESE WOULD 
MOVE WEST OFF THE STRAITS AND OVER THE KEYS. GULF WATERS MAY SEE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING OFF-MAINLAND CONVECTION. 

SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...I HAVE BRACKETED THIS PERIOD FOR 
POTENTIAL INFLUENCE BY THE TROPICAL WAVE NOW NEAR THE NE CARIBBEAN. 
GFS MODEL HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH A SUNDAY WAVE AXIS PASSAGE OVER 
THE KEYS...BUT DETAILS VARY FROM RUN TO RUN. NAM MODEL AT 84 HOURS 
IS FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH THE WAVE OVER THE BAHAMAS EARLY SATURDAY. 
CURRENT GFS RUN DOES NOT FORM ANY LOW CENTERS NEAR FLORIDA BUT 
INSTEAD NOW SHOWS ONE OVER WESTERN CUBA SUNDAY WITH THE WAVE AXIS 
EXTENDING NORTH FROM THE LOW AND PASSING THE KEYS SUNDAY. SO...
THERE MIGHT BE SOME PRE-WAVE-ARRIVAL SHOWER ENHANCEMENT SATURDAY 
NIGHT...AND THE GFS SHOWS DEEP SE TO S WIND FLOW AND MOISTURE 
CONTENT LINGERING OVER THE KEYS IN THE WAKE OF THE WAVE...ON INTO 
TUESDAY. I AM STEPPING UP CHANCE OF RAIN TO 40 PCT...AND ALSO 
STAYING WITH AT LEAST 15 KT WINDS BEFORE AND JUST AFTER (SUNDAY) 
WAVE PASSAGE.

TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...WE WILL NEED TO WATCH THE WIND SURGE 
FOLLOWING THE WAVE AXIS...OTHERWISE MAYBE A RETURN TO MORE EAST OR 
SE FLOW AND MORE CLIMO POPS. ITS UNCERTAIN.
&&

.MARINE...
LATE AFTERNOON EAST WINDS HAVE DIPPED IN SPEED A FEW KNOTS...
BUT HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH SHOULD RESUME AN EASTERLY
FLOW NEAR 15 KT ON MOST KEYS WATERS TONIGHT. LOOK FOR A FAIRLY
STEADY EAST BREEZE 15 KT TO BE WITH US MOST OF THE TIME THROUGH
SATURDAY...TURNING NE OR ENE SAT NIGHT...THEN SHIFTING TO SE AND 
S STILL 15 KT SUNDAY AS A TROPICAL WAVE PASSES. WE WILL NEED TO 
WATCH THIS WAVE FOR POSSIBLE INCREASES IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
COVERAGE SUNDAY INTO NEXT WEEK...AS WELL AS PERHAPS A WIND SURGE 
WITH THE WAVE PASSAGE.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
320 AM EDT WED JUL 26 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE STRETCHES FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC 
SOUTHWESTWARD OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTH FLORIDA...BUT IT HAS BEEN 
SEVERED OVER THE PENINSULA RESULTING IN A SEPARATE AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN GULF. THIS HAS CAUSED WINDS ACROSS THE 
AREA TO TURN TO NORTHEAST OR EAST NORTHEAST OVER OUR AREA. KBYX 
DETECTS A CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS MOVING OVER THE STRAITS BEYOND 20 
NM SOUTH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS...WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
STORMS ELSEWHERE. THIS ACTIVITY HAS PRODUCED MULTIPLE RESIDUAL 
BOUNDARIES WHICH ARE AFFECTING WINDS AT SEVERAL OBSERVING STATIONS. 
OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION AND BOUNDARY EFFECTS...WINDS ARE NORTHEAST TO 
EAST AT AROUND 10 MPH ALONG THE ISLANDS...AND 10 TO 15 KNOTS ON THE 
REEF. TEMPERATURES IN THE KEYS HAVE DIPPED INTO THE LOW TO MID 80S 
WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

FORECAST:
THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT NORTHWARD TOWARD NORTH 
FLORIDA OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. CONCURRENTLY...A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH 
WILL PASS BY SOUTH OF OUR AREA TODAY. THESE TWO EVENTS WILL RESULT 
IN A TIGHTENING GRADIENT AND SOMEWHAT HIGHER WIND SPEEDS OVER THE 
KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS.

TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...GFS AND UKMET INDICATE THAT THE GRADIENT WILL 
TIGHTEN BETWEEN THE RIDGE TO THE NORTH AND WEAK LOW PRESSURE TO THE 
SOUTH...RESULTING IN SOMEWHAT HIGHER WINDS BEGINNING TODAY AND 
CONTINUING FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. THE NAM INSISTS THAT A TROUGH 
OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WILL SEEP SOUTHWARD INTO 
CENTRAL FLORIDA...KEEPING THE RIDGE SEVERED AND FURTHER SOUTH AND 
LIGHTENING OUR GRADIENT...DELAYING THE INCREASE IN WINDS UNTIL EARLY 
FRIDAY MORNING. GIVEN CONSISTENCY BETWEEN GFS AND UKMET OVER LAST 
SEVERAL RUNS...HAVE FAVORED GFS AND UKMET SOLUTION IN THIS MORNINGS 
FORECAST. WITH EASTERLY FLOW A BIT STRONGER OVER THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE OVER THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS AND ACROSS THE KEYS INTO THE BAY AND GULF WATERS.

SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
BOTH THE GFS AND NAM ARE INDICATING AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE MOVING 
THROUGH THE BAHAMAS ON SATURDAY. GFS BRINGS THIS FEATURE NEAR 
FLORIDA ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. GIVEN THE HIGH DEGREE OF 
UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE EXISTENCE OF SUCH A SYSTEM THIS FAR 
OUT...MUCH LESS ITS STRENGTH AND LOCATION...THE ONLY REFLECTION OF 
ITS POTENTIAL EFFECTS IN THE MORNING PACKAGE WILL BE TO CARRY 
SOUTHEASTEARLY WINDS ON SUNDAY IN THE MARINE FORECAST. THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SYSTEM...IF IT OCCURS...WILL BE A PRIMARY 
FORECAST QUESTION FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

&&

.MARINE...
AS THE RIDGE MOVES NORTHWARD TOWARD NORTH FLORIDA...EASTERLY WINDS 
WILL INCREASE A BIT TODAY AND REMAIN STEADY FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
NO CAUTIONARY OR ADVISORIES HEADLINES ARE ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME.

&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS PRODUCING BRIEF MVFR/IFR CEILING/VISIBILITY CAN BE 
EXPECTED...WITH MOSTLY EAST WINDS OF AROUND 10 KNOTS AT BOTH THE KEY 
WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS.

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS:
UPPER RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...WHILE THE SURFACE RIDGE 
CONTINUES TO EDGE SLOWLY NORTHWARD FROM THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS TO THE 
NORTHERN GULF COAST. SURFACE WINDS ARE OUT OF THE EAST TO EAST 
NORTHEAST WITH SPEEDS 7 TO 10 MPH OVER THE ISLANDS...AND AROUND 10 
KNOTS ALONG THE REEF. A FEW GUSTS TO 15 KNOTS WERE NOTED AT MOLASSES 
REEF AND LONG KEY. EVENING SOUNDING INDICATED LITTLE CHANGE IN 
MOISTURE FROM THIS MORNING WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER NEAR 1.9 
INCHES...HOWEVER IT WAS A BIT WARMER FROM 700 MB TO 500 MB. THUS 
CAPES HAVE SLIPPED BELOW 3000 J/KG. HOWEVER THE INDICATED WIND IS 
NOW UNIFORMLY OUT OF THE EAST-NORTHEAST THROUGHOUT THE TROPOSPHERE 
WITH SPEEDS PICKING UP TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS ABOVE THE SURFACE. 3.9 
MICRON IMAGERY SHOWING CLUSTERS OF CUMULUS ACROSS THE BAHAMAS WITH 
THE KBYX 88D INDICATING A VIGOROUS CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS AROUND 
40 NM OFFSHORE KEY LARGO MOVING WEST. GOES PRECIPITABLE WATER 
ESTIMATES WERE AROUND 1.8 TO 1.9 INCHES ACROSS THE BAHAMAS AND THE 
KEYS...WITH DRIER AIR FURTHER INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF...SOUTHEAST 
BAHAMAS AND EASTERN CUBA. SHOWERS HAVE ALSO BEEN RAPIDLY DEVELOPING 
IN THE GULF WATERS BEYOND 30 NM NORTH OF KEY WEST.

FORECAST:
WHILE THE WARMING OF THE MID LEVELS HELPS TO INHIBIT 
CONVECTION...THE CURRENTLY ACTIVE CONVECTION IS SURE TO PRODUCE AN 
ADDITIONAL OUTFLOW BOUNDARY THROUGH THE STRAITS TONIGHT. WINDS IN 
THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME A LITTLE MORE EASTERLY 
OVERNIGHT AS THE SURFACE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH BUILDS A BIT STRONGER. 
GFS INDICATES A HINT OF AN 850 MB TROF PASSING THROUGH DURING THE 
EARLY MORNING HOURS...PERHAPS RESULT OF SOME SPEED CONVERGENCE AS 
THE EASTERLIES INCREASE A FEW KNOTS OVERNIGHT.

WITH THIS IN MIND...BELIEVE THE SURGE IN THE EASTERLIES MAY OFFSET 
THE WARMING A BIT TO WARRANT RECOMBINING THE PUBLIC ZONES WITH A 30 
POP OVERNIGHT. WINDS AND TEMPERATURES LOOK GOOD.
&&

.MARINE...
EAST WINDS HAVE PICKED UP A BIT AND WARRANT 10 TO 15 KNOTS IN THE 
STRAITS FORECAST TONIGHT. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
CONTINUE OVERNIGHT.
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL BE FOUND ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST 
FLIGHT ROUTE...AND AT ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. THE MAIN IMPACTS 
TO AVIATION WILL BE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...TRACKING 
WESTWARD ACROSS THE ROUTE AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS IN A FAIRLY MOIST AND 
UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM CONVECTIVE FLOWS WILL 
BE EAST AT AROUND 10 KNOTS.

330 PM EDT TUE JUL 25 2006

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS:
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE AXIS THIS AFTERNOON EXTENDS WEST NEAR OR 
JUST NORTH OF GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND TO THE FLORIDA PENINSULA NEAR LAKE 
OKEECHOBEE. SEA BREEZE CIRCULATIONS HAVE DISRUPTED THE RIDGE-DRIVEN
FLOW AROUND THE SOUTHERN FLORIDA PENINSULA...BUT OVER THE KEYS AND 
ITS ATLANTIC WATERS A DUE EAST BREEZE HAS SET IN AS EXPECTED...
ABOUT 10 KT. GULF OF MEXICO AND FLORIDA BAY WATERS IN THE KEYS AREA 
ALSO ARE RUNNING EAST 10 KT AT C-MAN AND PLATFORM SITES...BUT MAY BE 
MORE OF AN ONSHORE DIRECTION NEAR THE MAINLAND COAST. THE TCU/CB 
LINE THAT FORMED EARLIER OVER THE LOWER KEYS HAS DISSIPATED OR BEEN 
DISRUPTED AT THIS TIME...AND WHAT IS LEFT OF IT HAS BEEN PUSHED NW 
OF THE ISLANDS BY THE MORE EASTERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW. A SMALL BATCH OF 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE MOVING W OFF CAPE SABLE...WHILE ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE SEEN OVER THE BAHAMAS. 

FORECAST:
TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...A DEEP LAYERED HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ORIENTED 
EAST-TO-WEST WILL LIE WELL NORTH OF THE KEYS THROUGH FRIDAY... 
PROVIDING A DEEP EASTERLY FLOW (SURFACE UP TO 500 MB) OVER THE KEYS. 
ONLY MINOR PERTURBATIONS ARE SEEN IN AN OTHERWISE NEARLY HOMOGENEOUS 
MARITIME FLOW DURING THIS PERIOD. AN INCREASE IN SURFACE WIND SPEEDS 
IS STILL EXPECTED AS THE SURFACE RIDGE EXPANDS SOMEWHAT INTO NORTH 
FLORIDA...AND THOSE MINOR RIPPLES PASS NEAR OR SOUTH OF THE KEYS. 
MODELS KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE MOIST FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 700 MB MOST 
OF THE TIME WITH JUST SOME MINOR FLUCTUATIONS IN THE MOISTURE DEPTH.
THIS PATTERN WOULD TEND TO FAVOR LATE NIGHT AND MORNING SHOWER 
ACTIVITY MOVING WEST OVER THE KEYS...WHILE AFTERNOON TCU/CB 
BUILD-UPS FROM ISLAND HEATING WOULD TEND TO BLOW WEST AND OFF THE 
ISLANDS. I WILL KEEP THE ONGOING FORECAST FOR TONIGHT THAT HAS LOWER 
KEYS CHANCE OF RAIN DROPPING TO SLIGHT CHANCE LATE...WHILE KEEPING 
THE 30 PCT CHANCE GOING FOR UPPER AND MID KEYS. THEN...A STRAIGHT 30 
PCT CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL BE INDICATE FOR EACH PERIOD THEREAFTER 
THROUGH FRIDAY...AND AGAIN THERE MAY BE SOME LATE NIGHT AND MORNING 
FAVORITISM. 

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...THE TROPICAL WAVE CURRENTLY OUT IN THE 
ATLANTIC JUST WEST OF LONGITUDE 50W...HAS NO CONVECTION WITH IT BUT 
STILL SHOWS A LOW LEVEL CYCLONIC SWIRL AND ITS AMPLITUDE STRETCHES 
NORTH TO 20N AND SOUTH TO ALMOST 10N. THE GFS AND CANADIAN MODELS
TRACK THIS FEATURE INTO THE SE BAHAMAS...AND BEGIN TO AMPLIFY IT 
OVER THE NW BAHAMAS SATURDAY. MODELS SUGGEST SOME PRECEDING MOISTURE 
MAY COME INTO THE KEYS FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN THE PATTERN BECOMES VERY 
MURKY THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS TO WHETHER THE SYSTEM WILL SIMPLY 
PROGRESS WEST OVER FLORIDA AND THE KEYS...OR WILL SPLIT AND TURN 
NORTH ALONG THE FLORIDA EAST COAST. I WILL KEEP A PERSISTENCE 
FORECAST GOING AT THIS TIME...BUT INDICATE A TURN OF WINDS TO SE ON 
SUNDAY AS A BEGRUDGING ACKNOWLEDGEMENT THAT A WAVE OR TROUGH MAY 
PASS THE AREA. THERE IS TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY ON DEVELOPMENT, TIMING, 
AND PLACEMENT OF THE SYSTEM AT THIS POINT TO BE SPECIFIC. 

SUNDAY NIGHT-TUESDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS SHOWS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE 
BUILDING BACK TOWARD THE KEYS. 
&&

.MARINE...
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL SHIFT A BIT FARTHER OVER THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS TO EXTEND OVER CENTRAL AND NORTH FLORIDA...AND WILL
EXPAND A BIT IN SIZE. THIS IS EXPECTED TO KEEP KEYS WINDS BLOWING 
FROM THE EAST THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH SPEEDS IN THE STRAITS PICKING UP 
TO NEAR 15 KT WED THROUGH FRI...10-15 KT FOR BAY AND GULF WATERS. 
THEN...UNCERTAINTY EXISTS FOR FRI NIGHT ON THROUGH THE WEEKEND...
DUE TO THE APPROACH OF A TROPICAL WAVE WHICH IS NOW STILL WELL EAST 
OF THE LESSER ANTILLES. THE POSITIONING AND NATURE OF THE WAVE MAY 
EVENTUALLY HAVE SOME EFFECT ON KEYS AREA WINDS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KMTH AND KEYW THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. SHORT-LIVED (25 MINUTES OR LESS) MVFR CONDITIONS 
ARE POSSIBLE AT KEYW AND KMTH LATE TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...BUT THIS POSSIBILITY IS TOO LOW TO INCLUDE MVFR CONDITIONS 
IN EITHER THE KEYW OR KMTH TERMINAL FORECASTS. CIRCUMNAVIGABLE IFR 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE TONIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING.

1000 AM EDT TUE JUL 25 2006

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS:
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE HAS SHIFTED SLIGHTLY NORTHWARD OVER THE 
PAST 24 HOURS...NOW EXTENDING WEST NEAR OR JUST NORTH OF GRAND 
BAHAMA ISLAND TO THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. A SUBTLE SOUTH-NORTH TROUGH
MAY LIE SOUTH OF THE RIDGE AXIS...JUST EAST OF THE KEYS...WHICH IS 
CURRENTLY GIVING THE KEYS AN ENE WIND FLOW NEAR 10 KT. NUMEROUS 
SMALL CU/TCU CLOUD LINES ARE SEEN ON SATELLITE AT THIS TIME OVER THE 
KEYS AND NEARBY WATERS...SOME OF WHICH ARE PRODUCING SHOWERS. THE 
KEY WEST SOUNDING THIS MORNING SHOWS AN AIRMASS SLIGHTLY MORE MOIST 
THAN 24 HOURS AGO...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER NOW UP TO 1.86 INCH.  

FORECAST:
MODELS STILL INDICATE THAT SURFACE WINDS WILL BE FROM THE ENE 
THROUGH MIDDAY..TURNING CLOSER TO DUE EAST LATER ON. THE WIND 
PROFILE...IN COMBINATION WITH AVAILABLE MOISTURE...SHOULD BE
CONDUCIVE TO SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT OVER OR NEAR 
ISLANDS...WITH THE LOWER KEYS MORE FAVORED. CONDITIONS ALSO ARE 
FAVORABLE FOR FUNNEL CLOUD AND WATERSPOUT DEVELOPMENT NEAR THE KEYS. 

NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES IS NEEDED.
&&

.MARINE...
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL KEEP KEYS AREA WINDS BLOWING 
IN MAINLY FROM AN EAST DIRECTION NEAR 10 KT. BOATERS...BE ALERT FOR 
FUNNEL CLOUDS AND WATERSPOUTS TODAY. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KMTH TODAY AND TONIGHT. THERE IS A 
CHANCE OF MVFR CONDITIONS AFFECTING KMTH THIS AFTERNOON...BUT THE 
CHANCE IS NOT GREAT ENOUGH TO INCLUDE MVFR CONDITIONS IN THE KMTH 
TERMINAL FORECAST. 

INTERMITTENT MVFR CONDITIONS WILL IMPACT KEYW THIS MORNING INTO 
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP NEAR 
KEYW THIS AFTERNOON. MOST OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE LOCATED 
GREATER THAN 5 MILES AWAY FROM KEYW...BUT THERE IS A CHANCE THAT A 
THUNDERSTORM OR TWO COULD MOVE DIRECTLY OVER KEYW...PRODUCING WIND 
GUSTS NEAR 20 KNOTS AND HEAVY RAIN...REDUCING THE VISIBILITY TO IFR 
CONDITIONS OR LOWER. IN ADDITION...WATERSPOUTS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE 
VICINITY OF KEYW. VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW TONIGHT.  

THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD AFFECT ABOUT 25% OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE 
TODAY. AN EASTERLY STEERING FLOW SHOULD KEEP THUNDERSTORMS WEST OF 
THE KMIA/KFLL METRO AREAS TODAY. CIRCUMNAVIGABLE IFR CONDITIONS 
ANTICIPATED ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE TONIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
A WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND 
INTO THE EASTERN GULF. THE RIDGE IS CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE KEYS THAT 
WINDS ACROSS THE AREA ARE LIGHT AND GENERALLY EASTERLY AT 5 TO 10 KT 
ON THE WATER AND AROUND 5 MPH ALONG THE ISLANDS. TEMPERATURES HAVE 
DIPPED INTO THE LOWER 80S UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES...WITH DEWPOINTS 
IN THE MID 70S. KBYX RADAR DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION IN OUR 
AREA...WITH A CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS CREEPING SLOWLY WESTWARD OVER 
THE WATERS ABOUT 40 MILES EST OF OCEAN REEF.

FORECAST:
A MID LATITUDE TROUGH ALONG THE MID ATLANTIC COAST WILL CAUSE THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE STRETCHING ACROSS FLORIDA TO SPLIT...WITH A RIDGE 
JUST EAST OF THE PENINSULA AND A HIGH PRESSURE CENTER OVER THE 
EASTERN GULF. THEREAFTER...THE RIDGE WILL LIFT SLOWLY NORTHWARD 
TOWARD NORTH FLORIDA.

TODAY AND TONIGHT...THE SPLIT IN THE RIDGE WILL KEEP WINDS LIGHT 
ACROSS THE AREA. WIND PROFILES IN THE LOW LEVELS ARE CONDUCIVE FOR 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUD LINES OVER AND NEAR THE LOWER KEYS 
TODAY...ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERNOON. WATERSPOUTS WILL BE POSSIBLE 
WITHIN THESE CLOUD LINES...AND WILL PROBABLY BE MENTIONED IN THE 
UPCOMING HWO. ALSO...LOW LEVEL EAST TO EAST NORTHEASTERLY WINDS WILL 
ALLOW CONVECTION FROM THE MAINLAND TO DRIFT WESTWARD INTO THE GULF 
WATERS OFFSHORE MAINLAND MONROE. HOWEVER...CLOUD LINES AND MAINLAND 
CONVECTION ARE MUCH LESS LIKELY OVER THE UPPER AND MIDDLE 
KEYS...THEREFORE HAVE SPLIT THE ZONES IN THE PUBLIC FORECAST TO 
REFLECT DIFFERENCES IN POPS.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...AS THE RIDGE LIFTS NORTHWARD A SOMEWHAT 
TIGHTER GRADIENT SHOULD AFFECT THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. 
SEVERAL SMALL LOW PRESSURE RIPPLES MAY PASS BY US TO THE 
SOUTH...FURTHER ENHANCING THE GRADIENT FLOW. HOWEVER...THERE IS 
DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE MODELS AS TO HOW FAR NORTH OF US THE RIDGE 
WILL BE AS WELL AS THE EXTENT TO WHICH LOW PRESSURE TO THE SOUTH MAY 
AFFECT US...AND AS A RESULT THERE IS DISAGREEMENT AS TO PROGGED WIND 
SPEEDS AS WELL. GFS TAKES THE RIDGE FARTHER NORTH THAN THE NAM...AND 
THUS INDICATES HIGHER WIND SPEEDS BEGINNING LATE TONIGHT/EARLY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. THE NAM KEEPS THE RIDGE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS 
THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK...RESULTING IN LIGHTER WIND SPEEDS. THE 
UKMET IS IN THE MIDDLE. GIVEN THAT THE SURFACE RIDGE IS ALREADY 
FURTHER NORTH THAN INDICATED BY THE NAM...AND THAT THE MODEL HOLDS 
IT FURTHER SOUTH DUE TO LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPMENT OFF THE ATLANTIC 
COAST THAT SEEMS TO STRONG...HAVE DISREGARDED ITS SOLUTION AND 
FAVORED THE UKMET AND GFS IN THE MORNING PACKAGE. HOWEVER...GFS HAS 
BACKED OFF ITS WINDS FROM YESTERDAY MORNINGS RUN...AND MAY STILL BE 
OVERDONE TODAY. THEREFORE HAVE NOT JUMPED TOO HIGH ON 
WINDS...STICKING CLOSER TO UKMET SOLUTION.

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
THE RIDGE REACHING ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA WILL GRADUALLY 
ERODE...BRINGING LIGHTER WINDS BACK TO THE AREA BY SUNDAY. CLIMO 
POPS AND TEMPERATURES WILL BE KEPT THROUGH THE PERIOD.

&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT EAST WINDS WILL PERSIST TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT...BEFORE 
GRADUALLY BECOMING GENTLE TO MODERATE LATER TONIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY. NO CAUTIONARY OR ADVISORIES HEADLINES ARE ANTICIPATED AT 
THIS TIME.

&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...ISOLATED 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED WITH 
MOSTLY EAST WINDS OF 10 KNOTS OR LESS AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB)...AS OF 800 
PM...A SERIES OF SHORTWAVE TROUGHS ARE MIGRATING ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY...GREAT LAKES...AND THE UPPER MIDWEST. SOUTH OF THAT...A 
DEVELOPING REGIONAL SCALE UPPER ANTICYCLONE IS POSITIONED FROM SOUTH 
FLORIDA TO 28N 70W. FARTHER WEST...AN UPPER LOW IS POSITIONED OVER 
THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. THE FLORIDA KEYS NOW LIE WITHIN DRIER 
UPPER ANTICYCLONIC FLOW ON THE SOUTHWEST PERIPHERY OF THE DEVELOPING 
WESTERN ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE.

IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...A WEAK COLD 
FRONT/STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDS FROM NORTH CAROLINA TO TEXAS. SOUTH 
OF THAT...A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM THE 
NORTH CENTRAL ATLANTIC OCEAN SOUTHWEST TO ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS 
AND INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO.

.CURRENTLY...A FINE EVENING IS ON TAP ACROSS THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN 
WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THIS EVENING ACROSS THE CONCH REPUBLIC AND 
ADJOINING WATERS. KEY WEST RADAR INDICATES ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
NEAR THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA. 10 METER WINDS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF 
AND ACROSS SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST NEAR 5 KNOTS. 
THE 00Z EVENING SOUNDING IS ILLUSTRATING A MUCH MORE STABLE AND

FORECAST:
TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...
HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC CURRENTLY EXTENDS ACROSS THE 
KEYS SERVICE AREA. THIS AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL STRENGTHEN AND 
LIFT NORTH TO SOUTH FLORIDA OVERNIGHT...AND PERSIST THROUGH EARLY 
WEDNESDAY. MODELS INDICATE A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE TUESDAY AND 
TUESDAY NIGHT...AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES OFF THE DELMARVA 
COAST...RESULTING IN A SEPARATE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM FORMING OVER 
THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. IF THIS SITUATION COMES INTO 
FRUITION...WINDS OVER THE KEYS WOULD BACK TO THE NORTHEAST UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE GULF HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM. NORTHEAST WIND WOULD 
FAVOR CUMULUS CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT TUESDAY...AND ALLOW FOR 
CONVECTION TO APPROACH THE KEYS TUESDAY EVENING FROM THE MAINLAND. 
HENCE...A 40 PERCENT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE 
FORECAST FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL RESTRENGTHEN AND 
EXTEND OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...AND DRIFT EVEN

.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE SOUTH 
NEAR 5 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST NEAR 5 
KNOTS. TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM THE UPPER 70S TO THE LOWER 80S. ONLY 
ABOUT SEVEN DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO LIGHT SOUTH 
SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S.  

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...
A DEEP LAYERED ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE 
KEYS TODAY INTO MONDAY. THIS RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD START TO 
LIFT NORTHWARD MONDAY NIGHT. WITH NO SYNOPTIC SCALE ASCENT PRESENT 
TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...RAIN CHANCES WILL BE NO HIGHER THAN LOW 
CHANCE CATEGORY BASED UPON MESOSCALE FORCING. THE WIND FIELD TODAY 
LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR AN ISLAND CUMULUS CLOUD LINE TO DEVELOP NEAR THE 
KEYS. LOW CHANCE POPS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR TODAY. A SLIGHT RISK OF 
WATERSPOUTS WILL BE MENTIONED IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK FOR 
TODAY. THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE FLOW TO CAUSE CONVERGENCE TONIGHT 
DUE TO THE DEEP LAYERED RIDGE AXIS OVERHEAD. THE ONLY FORCING 
CAPABLE OF IGNITING CONVECTION TONIGHT WILL BE RANDOM OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES LEFTOVER FROM CONVECTION TODAY. AS A RESULT...POPS WILL 
BE DROPPED FROM LOW CHANCE CATEGORY TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY FOR 
TONIGHT. ONCE AGAIN...THE WIND FIELD MONDAY LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR AN 
ISLAND CUMULUS CLOUD LINE TO DEVELOP NEAR THE KEYS MONDAY AFTERNOON. 
LOW CHANCE POPS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR MONDAY. AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
MAY BEGIN TO DEVELOP NEAR THE CAROLINAS MONDAY NIGHT. A TROUGH OF 
LOW PRESSURE EXTENDING SOUTHWARD FROM THE LOW OVER THE CAROLINAS MAY 
MOVE THROUGH THE KEYS EITHER TUESDAY OR TUESDAY NIGHT. IF THIS 
SCENARIO PANS OUT...MOISTURE WILL INCREASE AND WINDS WILL BACK TO 
MORE OF A NORTH TO NORTHEAST DIRECTION TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. 
EVEN IF THERE IS NO SYNOPTIC SCALE ASCENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH 
OF LOW PRESSURE...A MORE NORTHERLY STEERING FLOW WOULD ALLOW 
SEABREEZE CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA 
TO APPROACH THE KEYS FROM THE NORTH TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND TUESDAY 
EVENING. THEREFORE...POPS WILL BE RAISED BY 10 PERCENT FOR THE 
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE 
FLORIDA KEYS.     

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)... 
WINDS SHOULD SLOWLY INCREASE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS AN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA STRENGTHENS. THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD REMAIN OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY. THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE 
FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE BASED UPON CLIMATOLOGY.  

&&

.MARINE...
SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS SHOULD BE MAINLY SOUTH AT 10 KNOTS OR LESS 
ON ALL WATERS TODAY. MARINERS ON THE NEARSHORE WATERS SURROUNDING 
THE KEYS SHOULD BE AWARE OF THE SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF WATERSPOUTS 
TODAY...ESPECIALLY ON THE NEARSHORE WATERS NORTH OF THE KEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON. WINDS SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. 
BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD BE JUST BELOW CAUTIONARY 
CRITERIA (15 TO 20 KNOTS AND/OR SEAS OF 6 FEET) ON ATLANTIC WATERS. 
NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED TODAY THROUGH AT 
LEAST WEDNESDAY. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT WINDS AND SEAS COULD REACH 
CAUTIONARY CRITERIA ON ATLANTIC WATERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS MORNING  
ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE AND AT ISLAND TERMINALS. ONLY 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD AFFECT THE KMIA-KEYW 
FLIGHT ROUTE. TODAY...WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE TRIGGERED BY SEA BREEZES OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. 
HOWEVER...MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD FAVOR SOUTH FLORIDA EAST 
COAST DUE TO A SOUTHWESTERLY STEERING FLOW. COVERAGE WILL REMAIN 
ISOLATED OVER THE KEYS PORTION OF THE ROUTE TODAY...AND WILL MOST 
LIKELY BE LOCATED GULF SIDE OF THE ISLAND CHAIN...ALONG ISLAND CLOUD 
LINES. SURFACE WINDS OUTSIDE OF DIURNAL AND CONVECTIVE FLOWS WILL

MEXICO. EAST OF THAT...A MESOSCALE UPPER CYCLONE IS ROTATING NEAR 
ANDROS ISLAND. UPPER RIDGING IS NOW EVIDENT FROM JUST EAST OF 
ELEUTHERA ISLAND NORTHEAST TO NEAR 30N 50W. AT 00Z...THE KEY WEST 
EVENING SOUNDING INDICATED THAT THE FLORIDA KEYS LIKELY REMAIN 
BENEATH A MOIST AND UNSTABLE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THE LARGER SCALE 
UPPER CYCLONIC GYRE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL GULF TO THE WEST. 

IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...A COLD FRONT IS 
DRAPED FROM THE NORTHERN APPALACHIANS SOUTHWEST TO EAST TEXAS. ON 
THE REGIONAL SCALE...WELL TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THAT...00Z MSAS 
ANALYSIS AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THAT A LOW LEVEL RIDGE IS 
POSITIONED FROM THE FLORIDA STRAITS NORTHEASTWARD TO ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN BAHAMAS TO A LARGE ANTICYCLONE CENTERED IN THE NORTH 
CENTRAL ATLANTIC OCEAN NEAR 35N 50W. A SMALLER SCALE LOW LEVEL 
TROUGH IS ANALYZED FROM NEAR BUOY 42003 EASTWARD ACROSS TO LAKE OKEE 
AND NEAR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. 

.CURRENTLY...LARGE AREA OF HEAVY SHOWERS WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS 
IMPACTED THE AREA FROM WEST TO EAST EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. NUMEROUS OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MOVED ACROSS THE KEYS FROM THE 
WEST AND SOUTH...WITH ISOLATED WIND GUSTS BETWEEN 30 AN 35 KNOTS 
REPORTED. ACTIVITY BEGAN TO WANE BY SUNSET. AS OF 900 
PM...TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 70S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 
70S. 10 METER WINDS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA 
BAY ARE BETWEEN WEST AND SOUTHWEST BETWEEN 5 AND 8 KNOTS. SKIES ARE 
PARTLY CLOUDY. KEY WEST RADAR IS NOT DETECTING ANY ECHOES AT THIS 
TIME.

FORECAST...TONIGHT AND TOMORROW(IN THE UPPER LEVELS)...THE UPPER 
RIDGE TO OUR IMMEDIATE EAST WILL TAKE ITS TIME MOVING INTO THE AREA. 
THE KEYS SERVICE AREA WILL STILL REMAIN UNDER A BIT OF DIVERGENCE 
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...WITH THE 18Z RUN SHOWING BEST DIVERGENCE OVER 
THE EASTERN STRAITS AND THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS AROUND 12Z. THE 
UPPER RIDGE SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE AREA BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON...SO 
ASSOCIATED DRYING AND SUBSIDENCE SHOULD THEN MOVE OVER THE AREA FROM 
THE EAST.

IN THE LOW AND MID-LEVELS...THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE IS SLOWLY MOVING 
BACK TO THE NORTH...BUT DO NOT THINK IT WILL BE COMPLETELY NORTH OF 
THE KEYS UNTIL TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THE ATMOSPHERE IS WORKED OVER 
ATTM...BUT LOTS OF BOUNDARIES WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVERNIGHT AND 
THESE WILL STILL BE AROUND JUST AFTER SUNRISE...WHEN WINDS OVER THE 
LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS BETWEEN 4 AND 20 KFT WILL BE FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST...GRADUALLY BECOMING SOUTHEAST BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WITH 
PWATS JUST UNDER 2.00 INCHES...MORNING REVERSE CUMULUS/TCU LINES 
LOOK TO BE A GOOD POSSIBILITY OVER THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS. 
THEREFORE AM RELUCTANT TO LOWER POPS FROM GOOD CHANCE ATTM. NO 
CHANGES TO THE FORECAST ATTM.

VARIABLE WINDS IN THE FIRST PERIOD. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE WATERS TOWARDS MORNING.

&&

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE ALONG MUCH OF THE KMIA-KEYW

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS PATCHY LIGHT RAIN OVER THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE 
WATERS SOUTH OF THE AREA FROM OCEAN REEF TO THE DRY TORTUGAS. 
ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY. 
WINDS OVER LAND ARE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST NEAR 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON 
AVERAGE...ARE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE 
NEAR 80 DEGREES. ONLY ABOUT EIGHT DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED 
TODAY DUE TO GENTLE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S.  

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN UNSTABLE AND VERY MOIST TODAY...WITH A 
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUE ABOVE TWO INCHES. A WEAK TROUGH OF 
LOW PRESSURE IS LOCATED OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. THIS TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL MOVE TO THE NORTH TODAY. UPPER LEVEL CYCLONIC FLOW 
OVER THE KEYS WILL BE REPLACED BY ANTICYCLONIC FLOW TODAY. THERE IS 
A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY UNTIL THE 
AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE MOVES OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA AND 
UPPER LEVEL CYCLONIC FLOW BECOMES REPLACED BY UPPER LEVEL 
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO 
BUILD ACROSS THE KEYS TONIGHT. PWAT VALUES SHOULD FALL BELOW TWO 
INCHES TONIGHT. POPS WILL BE DECREASED BY 10 PERCENT FOR TONIGHT DUE 
TO ATMOSPHERIC DRYING AND DEEP LAYERED ANTICYCLONIC FLOW BECOMING 
PREVALANT. THE DEEP LAYERED ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY BUILD ACROSS THE KEYS SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY. 
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY PORTION OF THE 
ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... 
WINDS SHOULD SLOWLY INCREASE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY AS THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE NEAR THE KEYS STRENGTHENS AND LIFTS 
NORTHWARD. A TROPICAL WAVE COULD BE APPROACHING THE KEYS FRIDAY. IT 
IS WAY TOO EARLY TO DISCERN TIMING AND STRENGTH OF A POTENTIAL 
TROPICAL WAVE ON DAY 7 OF THE FORECAST. THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE 
ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE BASED UPON CLIMATOLOGY.  

&&

.MARINE...
SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS ON ALL WATERS TODAY WILL 
DECREASE THIS WEEKEND. WINDS SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY...WINDS AND SEAS SHOULD BE JUST BELOW 
CAUTIONARY CRITERIA (15 TO 20 KNOTS AND/OR SEAS OF 6 FEET) ON 
ATLANTIC WATERS. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED 
TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY NIGHT. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT WINDS 
AND SEAS COULD REACH CAUTIONARY CRITERIA ON ATLANTIC WATERS 
WEDNESDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
PREVIOUS WIDESPREAD CONVECTION HAS STABILIZED THE ATMOSPHERE FOR THE 
TIME BEING. THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS MORNING...ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DEVELOP ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT 
ROUTE. TODAY...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE TRIGGERED BY SEABREEZES AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES OVER SOUTH 
FLORIDA. OVER THE KEYS AREA...COVERAGE WILL BE WIDELY SCATTERED TO 
ISOLATED...BUT WILL BE ALONG CLOUD LINES EXTENDING DOWNWIND OF THE 
LARGER ISLANDS. THE MARATHON TERMINAL WILL BE MORE LIKELY TO BE 
AFFECTED AS SHOWER MOTION WILL BE SOUTHWEST TO WEST SOUTHWEST. 
SURFACE WINDS OUTSIDE OF DIURNAL AND CONVECTIVE FLOWS WILL BE SOUTH 
TO SOUTHWEST AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS THROUGH TODAY.

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS:
SURFACE WIND FLOW AND PRESSURE PATTERN OVER THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING 
REGION HAS BEEN DISRUPTED BY WIDESPREAD CONVECTION THROUGH THE 
EVENING HOURS. THE 00Z EVENING SOUNDINGS AT KEY WEST AND MIAMI HAD A 
LIGHT LOW LEVEL WIND FLOW FROM THE SW...AND THIS STILL IS PROBABLY 
THE OVERALL SYNOPTIC FLOW WHICH HAS BEEN OVERCOME BY MESOSCALE 
OUTFLOWS AT THIS TIME. AREA WINDS ARE CURRENTLY RANGING FROM CALM TO 
ESE AT 17 KT. WHILE OVERALL STRENGTH AND COVERAGE OF CONVECTION HAS 
FINALLY DECREASED DURING THE PAST 2 HOURS...THERE ARE STILL AREAS OF 
LINGERING RAIN OVER THE LOWER AND UPPER KEYS...WITH SHOWERS AND SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE STRAITS. OF CONCERN IS NEW SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT SEEN ON RADAR AND SATELLITE OVER THE 
EXTREME SE GULF OF MEXICO...WHICH IS JUST NOW MOVING ENE INTO OUR 
FORECAST WATERS SOUTH OF DRY TORTUGAS. THE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION AND 
DISTURBED NATURE OF THE WEATHER OVER THE KEYS, NW BAHAMAS, SE GULF 
OF MEXICO IS HARD TO EXPLAIN...BUT A WEAK LOW CENTER AT 500 MB IS 
SUGGESTED IN WIND FIELDS JUST NORTH OF THE NW BAHAMAS WITH AN 
ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH EXTENDING SW TO THE GULF. AT THE SURFACE A 
WEAK TROUGH HAS MOVED WEST OF THE AREA AND INTO THE SE GULF...BUT 
ANOTHER WEAK SURFACE TROUGH MAY ALSO BE ANALYZED OVER THE STRAITS 
OFF THE UPPER KEYS AND SE PENINSULA...WITH A GENERALIZED REGION OF 
SURFACE CONVERGENCE SOUTH OF THAT FEATURE OVER THE KEYS. 

FORECAST:
CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS HAVE BEEN RIGHT ON TRACK THROUGH EVENING. I 
WILL UPDATE PRIOR TO MIDNIGHT TO FRESHEN WORDING AND DELETE LATE 
REFERENCES. SHOWERS HAVE BEEN DIMINISHING...BUT THEY ARE STILL 
AFFECTING SOME OF THE KEYS...AND NEW SHOWERS ARE SEEN DEVELOPING 
SOUTH AND WEST OF THE AREA. OVERNIGHT POPS WILL BE LEFT RELATIVELY 
HIGH...PROBABLY 50 PCT OR SO. 
&&

.MARINE...
AREA WINDS WERE DISTURBED BY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...BUT ARE 
EXPECTED TO RETURN TO A S TO SW FLOW AROUND 10 KT OVERNIGHT. THERE 
STILL IS A CHANCE OF MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN KEYS WATERS 
LATE TONIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MAINTAIN WIDESPREAD 
CLOUDINESS ACROSS THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE. AT THE PRESENT 
TIME...ACTIVITY IS LIMITED AT THE PRESENT TIME...HOWEVER...SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL REDEVELOP BY 0800Z...IMPACTING THE 
ROUTE DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. PERIODIC MVFR/VFR CIGS AND 
VISIBILITY WILL BE ENCOUNTERED WITHIN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. WINDS AT BOTH THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS WILL 
REMAIN BETWEEN NEARLY SOUTH LESS THAN 10 KNOTS OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS 
AND STORMS

PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER. 

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL 
BE LOCATED JUST OFFSHORE OF THE CAROLINAS TODAY. A TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL EXTEND SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA FROM THE 
UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE AREA TODAY. DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL COMBINE WITH ABUNDANT 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IN PLACE TO PRODUCE ANOTHER CLOUDY AND 
RAINY DAY ACROSS THE KEYS TODAY. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BEGIN TO BUILD ACROSS THE KEYS TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES WILL REMAIN ABOVE TWO INCHES 
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. CUBAN CONVECTION MAY MAKE IT TO THE KEYS 
TONIGHT AND MULTIPLE CONVECTIVE CLOUD LINES ARE LIKELY NEAR THE KEYS 
SATURDAY. AS A RESULT...POPS WILL BE RAISED BY 10 PERCENT FOR THE

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS...
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE OCCURRED ACROSS MOST OF THE 
LOWER KEYS...AND PORTIONS OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS SO FAR THIS 
MORNING. AS A RESULT...TEMPERATURES ALONG THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN 
CURRENTLY RANGE FROM THE UPPER 70S TO LOW 80S UNDER MOSTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES. WINDS AT THE CMAN PLATFORMS AND ASOS STATIONS HAVE AVERAGED 
EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS AROUND 10 KNOTS. 

THE SOUNDING THIS MORNING REMAINS MOIST...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUE OF 2.13 INCHES. SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS PREVAILED 
FROM THE SURFACE TO 600 MB. 

FORECAST...
THE FORECAST WAS UPDATED EARLIER THIS MORNING...AS NUMEROUS SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WERE OCCURRING ACROSS THE KEYS SERVICE 
AREA...ESPECIALLY OVER AND AROUND THE LOWER KEYS. OTHERWISE...MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES SKIES WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S WITH 
PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS CAN BE ANTICIPATED FOR THE REMAINDER 
OF THE DAY. 
&&

.MARINE...
OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION AND BOUNDARIES...SOUTHEAST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 
KNOTS WILL PREVAIL THIS AFTERNOON. THE GREATEST CONCERN FOR MARINERS 
THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS...WHICH WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING GUSTY 
WINDS AROUND 25 TO 30 KNOTS...AS WELL AS FREQUENT LIGHTNING 
STRIKES.  
&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PREDOMINATELY COVER THE 
ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...WITH THE MEAN CELL MOTION OF 
16008KT. AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS...MOSTLY SOUTHEAST 
WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS...EXCEPT VARIABLE AND GUSTY TO NEAR 25 KNOTS 
IN THE STRONGER SHOWERS AND STORMS. MAX TOPS OF AROUND 45000 FEET 
CAN BE ANTICIPATED FOR THE ENTIRE ROUTE.

300 AM EDT THU JUL 20 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVEL(500-200MB)...AS OF 200 AM...A LARGE 
AND SPRAWLING SYNOPTIC SCALE ANTICYCLONE WITH HEIGHTS BETWEEN 595 
AND 600 DM REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL PLAINS 
STATES...WITH THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS SYSTEM REACHING THE 
CAROLINA PIEDMONT AND THE SOUTHERN EXTENT ACROSS THE NORTHWESTERN 
GULF COAST. TO THE SOUTH...A NARROW AND WEAKER RIDGE IS ANCHORED 
FROM NORTH FLORIDA WESTWARD TO THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. 
EAST OF THAT...A WELL DEFINED AND OBLONG SHAPED POSITIVELY TILTED 
UPPER LOW IS CENTERED 300 MILES NORTH OF HISPANIOLA. SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS LIE BENEATH DEVELOPING UPPER ANTICYCLONIC FLOW SOUTH OF 
THE FLORIDA RIDGE.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...AS OF 200 
AM...TROPICAL STORM BERYL IS NOW EAST OF THE DELMARVA PENINSULA AND 
NOW MOVING NORTHEAST AT A MODERATE PACE...AND IS ENCOUNTERING 
SOUTHERLY SHEAR. SOUTH OF THAT...EVIDENCE OF WEAK LOW LEVEL RIDGING 
IS FOUND FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC TO ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA. THE MAIN 
AXIS OF A WEAK TROPICAL WAVE IS POSITIONED OVER EASTERN CUBA. ON THE 
REGIONAL SCALE...SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS LIE IN A RATHER STILL 
MOIST BUT DEVELOPING GENTLE TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST FLOW ON THE 
SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED DEVELOPING LOW LEVEL 
RIDGE...AND ON THE EAST SIDE OF A WELL DEFINED UNDULATION THAT 
CONTINUES TO MIGRATE WESTWARD ACROSS THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO.


.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 AM...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY OVER THE KEYS 
AND ADJOINING WATERS. KEY WEST RADAR IS INDICATING JUST ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS COVERING THE SERVICE AREA...EXCEPT 
ITS QUIET OVER THE EASTERN FLORIDA STRAITS ATTM. TEMPERATURES REMAIN 
IN THE MIDDLE 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER TO MID 70S. C-MAN 
STATIONS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE 
REGISTERING SOUTHEAST WINDS BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS WITH HIGHER 
GUSTS...AND 10 TO 15 MPH WINDS OVER LAND. 

.FORECASTS...IN THE UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB)...TODAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT...500 MB HEIGHTS NEAR 600 DM WITH LARGE SCALE 
ANTICYCLONE REMAIN OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS...WITH CONTINUOUS WEAK 
SHORTWAVE TROUGHS MOVING OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND NORTHEAST. SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND THE KEYS WILL REMAIN UNDER WEAK BUT BROAD LIGHT 
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW WITH HEIGHTS NEAR 590 DM. ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY 
NIGHT THE 00Z MODELS INDICATE A MORE PRONOUNCED SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
AMPLIFYING A BIT OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE CONUS...AS THE BASE 
OF ANOTHER TROUGH REACHES GEORGIA AND THE CAROLINAS. NEAR 590 DM 
HEIGHTS REMAINING NEAR THE KEYS. ON SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...UPPER 
RIDGING BEGINS TO BUILD ACROSS FLORIDA AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AS 
500 MB HEIGHTS RISE TO AROUND 592 AND 593 DM...WITH DRIER AIR 
BECOMING BETTER ESTABLISHED ABOVE 700 MB.

IN THE LOW AND MID-LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...THE 00Z NAM SEEMS TO INITIALIZE 
THE UNDULATION AT 06Z RIGHT TO OUR IMMEDIATE WEST. A DEVELOPING 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE...COMBINED WITH THE NEXT APPROACHING WAVE NOW 
AT THE LONGITUDE OF EASTERN CUBA...WILL ALLOW FOR GENTLE TO MODERATE 
BREEZES ACROSS THE WATERS AND THE ISLANDS. 00Z MARINE MOS IS 
DEPICTING THIS AS WELL. 00Z MAV MOS 12 HOUR POPS ARE NOW BETWEEN 60 
AND 70 PERCENT FOR TODAY...WITH 00Z NAM MOS NUMBERS NEAR 40 PERCENT. 
EXPECT LOW LEVEL CONFLUENT FLOW AGAIN TODAY AS THE NEXT WEAK WAVE 
TRACKS OVER THE AREA LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT. PWAT IS FORECAST TO BE 
AROUND 2 INCHES THROUGHOUT TODAY AND TONIGHT. WILL BOOST POPS BACK 
UP INTO THE GOOD CHANCE CATEGORY FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT A LAST 
MINUTE DECISION TO INCREASE POPS INTO THE LOW LIKELY CATEGORY FOR 
TODAY WILL BE MADE SHORTLY.

ON FRIDAY...PERSISTENT WET PATTERN TO CONTINUE AS THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OVER FLORIDA BEGINS TO SLIDE SOUTH...SLIDING SOUTH OF 
THE KEYS BY FRIDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...LOW TO MID LEVEL 
WINDS...FROM THE SURFACE TO 20 KFT...GRADUALLY VEER FROM SOUTHEAST 
TO SOUTH. 00Z GFS FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT 0-6 KM AVERAGE 
WINDS ARE FROM THE SOUTH ON FRIDAY NEAR 7 KNOTS...WITH THE NAM 
DEPICTING 0 TO 6 KM SOUTH FLOW NEAR 3 KNOTS. THIS IS STILL 
LIGHT...BUT PWATS REMAIN HIGH...NEAR 2.00 INCHES...AND LATEST 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS DEPICT ABUNDANT MOISTURE BELOW 650 MB. 00Z 12 
HOUR NAM AND GFS POP #S ARE IN THE LOW LIKELY CATEGORY FOR FRIDAY. 
WILL BOOST POPS TO GOOD CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY. 

ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...THE SURFACE TO 20000 FLOW GRADUALLY 
VEERS TO SOUTH SOUTHWEST...ALBEIT LIGHT...WITH INDICATIONS OF THE 
RIDGE REMAINING JUST SOUTH OF THE KEYS ON SATURDAY. IF THESE LATEST 
INDICATIONS OF THE RIDGE ARE CORRECT AND IT IS JUST SOUTH OF US...A 
FAVORABLE SOUTHWEST WIND PROFILE COMBINED WITH AMPLE PWATS NEAR 2.00 
INCHES WOULD ALLOW FOR HEALTHY REVERSE TCU/CUMULUS LINES ON 
SATURDAY. CAN AFFORD TO HOLD WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FRIDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY UNTIL THERE ARE CLEARER INDICATIONS THAT THE LOW 
LEVEL RIDGE WILL BEHAVE IN THIS WAY. THEREAFTER...THE LOW LEVEL 
RIDGE IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE BACK TO THE NORTH AGAIN OVER THE KEYS 
BY SATURDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING FOR A RETURN TO SOUTHEAST FLOW IN THE 
LOWEST FEW THOUSAND FEET SATURDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...WILL JUST 
INDICATE VARIABLE WINDS 5 TO 10 KNOTS IN THE LAND ZONES AND LIGHT 
SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST WINDS ON THE WATERS ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.

SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE IS STILL PROGGED TO 
BUILD NORTH OF THE KEYS...AND WITH NO OBVIOUS SIGNIFICANT TROUGHS 
WEAK WAVES PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FLOW...AND 20 TO 30 PERCENT 
12 HOUR RAIN CHANCES FOR THIS PERIOD...HAVE LOW CHANCE POPS IN THE 
FORECAST...AND WILL HOLD THIS THROUGH THE PERIOD.  
 
&&

.MARINE...GENTLE TO MODERATE WINDS ARE EXPECTED ACROSS ALL OF THE 
WATERS BY THE AFTERNOON. A WEAK WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE WATERS 
FROM EAST TO WEST...DELIVERING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
WINDS AND SEAS MAY BE HIGHER IS THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS. A RIDGE 
WILL GRADUALLY MOVE SOUTH AND POSSIBLY OVER THE KEYS BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT...AND REMAIN NEAR THE KEYS THROUGH SATURDAY...BEFORE MOVING 
NORTH OF THE KEYS SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. EXPECT GENTLE TO 
MODERATE WINDS TO BECOME LIGHT TO GENTLE FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT. GENTLE TO MODERATE EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL 
RETURN SUNDAY THROUGH NEXT WEEK.

&&

.AVIATION...STRONGER WINDS FROM THE SURFACE TO 10000FT AGL SHOULD 
ALLOW FASTER MOVEMENT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS TODAY...WITH A MEAN CELL 
MOTION VECTOR OF ABOUT 130/08KT. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN VERY 
MOIST AND UNSTABLE...SO SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL FORM EASILY WITH 
SCATTERED COVERAGE ACROSS THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS...AND 
NUMEROUS COVERAGE ACROSS MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA BY THIS AFTERNOON 
WHERE SEA-BREEZES WILL DEVELOP AGAIN. EXPECT MAX TOPS FL450-500 OVER 
MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA...AND FL40-450 OVER KEYS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS. SURFACE WINDS AT MTH AND EYW WILL AVERAGE 130-150/07-11KT...

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS:
AT THE SURFACE A WEAK AND RATHER BROAD HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS 
WEST NEAR OR JUST NORTH OF GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND TO THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA. SEA BREEZE CIRCULATIONS DOMINATED THE WIND FLOW OVER THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA THROUGH THE EVENING AND ARE 
JUST NOW WANING. MEANWHILE...A LIGHT MAINLY EAST WIND FLOW AT THE 
SURFACE OVER THE KEYS WAS OVERTOPPED BY VERY LIGHT WINDS (LESS THAN 
5 KT) ALOFT UP TO 500 MB. CONVECTION THAT FIRED OVER THE KEYS 
EARLIER TODAY AND THIS EVENING MOVED LITTLE AND CREATED CHAOTIC 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WHICH IN TURN SET OF MULTIPLE SUBSEQUENT ROUNDS 
OF MORE CONVECTION. AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM SW MAINLAND CONVECTION 
MOVED SW AND PASSED JUST NORTH AND WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS THE PAST 
COUPLE OF HOURS. AT THIS TIME...SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
THAT ORIGINATED FROM THE DAYTIME AND EVENING CONVECTION AND ITS 
OUTFLOWS ARE MOVING SW OVER THE WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS. NEW SHOWER 
DEVELOPMENT IS SEEN ALONG A LINE FROM FLORIDA BAY EXTENDING SW OVER 
THE MIDDLE KEYS AND OVER THE STRAITS. THIS LINE IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 
TURN OF WINDS TO ESE OR SE...AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN WIND SPEED TO 
10 KT OR 10-15 KT. 

FORECAST:
ALL MODELS INCLUDING THE GFS, NAM, UKMET, AND WRFNMM STILL INDICATE 
A TURN OF WINDS TO SE OR ESE AND A SLIGHT INCREASE IN SPEEDS. SO AS 
THE LEFT-OVER CONVECTION DEPARTS TO OUR SW...THE ONSET OF SE BREEZES 
AND WITH HIGH MOISTURE STILL IN PLACE...THEN THE CURRENTLY 
FORECASTED 30 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN OVERNIGHT IS REASONABLE. NO UPDATE 
IS PLANNED FOR PUBLIC ZONES. 
&&

.MARINE...
CHAOTIC WINDS PRODUCED BY AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO PICK UP FROM THE SE OVERNIGHT...
NEAR 10 KT FOR BAY AND GULF WATERS...10-15 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS.

DADE COUNTY...SOUTHWESTWARD TO THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS...BETWEEN KEY WEST AND THE MARQUESAS KEYS. 
MEANWHILE...STRENGTHENING TROPICAL STORM BERYL CONTINUES TO LIFT 
NORTHWARD OFFSHORE OF THE VIRGINIA/NORTH CAROLINA COAST. ACROSS THE

WINDS OF AROUND 10 KNOTS...WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING NORTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE FLORIDA 
BAY AND NEARSHORE ATLANTIC WATERS SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS.

FORECAST:
A MINOR LOW LEVEL (1000-850 MB) PERTURBATION EXTENDING FROM 
SOUTHWEST FLORIDA INTO THE LOWER KEYS THIS EVENING WILL MIGRATE INTO 
THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO TONIGHT...BEFORE A WEAK WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE NOSES INTO OUR AREA THURSDAY. ANOTHER SUBTLE

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS...
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WEAK TROUGH EXTENDING FROM CENTRAL 
DADE COUNTY SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE LOWER KEYS...AND INTO THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS. THIS TROUGH SPLITS THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A WEAK 
ATLANTIC RIDGE REACHING THE NORTHWEST BAHAMAS...AND AN AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. BECAUSE OF THESE 
PRESSURE FEATURES...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE EAST SOUTHEAST 
WINDS OVER OUR EASTERN WATERS...AND LIGHT AND VARIABLE ELSEWHERE. 
MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS...AND 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ELSEWHERE. OTHERWISE...OUR 
MORNING SOUNDING REVEALS A TYPICAL MOIST (PWAT 1.81 INCHES) AND 
CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH A LIGHT NORTHEAST FLOW REACHING 
WELL INTO THE TROPOSPHERE. 

FORECAST...
GIVEN AMPLE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IN PLACE...LOW LEVEL CONFLUENCE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBTLE TROUGH MIGRATING THROUGH OUR REGION 
SHOULD GENERATE A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER 
THE ISLAND CHAIN. SINCE THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST APPEARS ON 
TRACK...NO CHANGES ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME. 

&&

.MARINE...
OUR MORNING RAWINDSONDE DEPICTS NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF 3 AND 4 
KNOTS AT 1 AND 2 THOUSAND FEET WHICH COINCIDES WITH THE LATEST KBYX 
VWP. WITH THE SUBTLE UNDULATION TRACKING ACROSS OUR AREA...WINDS 
SHOULD BECOME EAST SOUTHEAST NEAR 10 KNOTS ON ALL WATERS.

OVER WESTERN OKLAHOMA...WITH THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF 
THIS FEATURE EXTENDING TO THE EASTERN SEABOARD...AS WELL AS THE 
NORTHERN GULF COAST STATES. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE BENEATH A COL 
REGION WITH DRY AIR ABOVE THE 700-500 LAYER. 

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...AS OF 200 AM...A 
COMPLEX SURFACE PATTERN IS ANALYZED WITH TROPICAL STORM BERYL 
SOUTHEAST OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA. FOR SPECIFIC INFORMATION 
REGARDING TROPICAL STORM BERYL...PLEASE REFER TO THE LATEST PUBLIC 
ADVISORY ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER. A LOW LEVEL RIDGE 
EXTENDS FROM 35N 50W SOUTHWEST TO NEAR THE BAHAMAS. THE MAIN AXIS OF 
A WEAK WAVE/LOW LEVEL TROUGH...IS NOW POSITIONED NEAR HAITI. ON THE 
REGIONAL SCALE...LATEST MSAS ANALYSIS YIELDS A SUBTLE LOW LEVEL 
PERTURBATION MIGRATING WESTWARD ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...WITH ITS 
MAIN AXIS FROM MIAMI TO ACROSS THE UPPER KEYS TO CUBA. A SEASONALLY 
MOIST AND UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE LOWER AND 
MIDDLE KEYS AHEAD OF THIS APPROACHING FEATURE.


.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 AM...SKIES ACROSS THE KEYS ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. 
KEY WEST RADAR DEPICTS SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE FLORIDA STRAITS SOUTH OF THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S WITH DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES IN THE 
MIDDLE 70S. MSAS ANALYSIS AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS REVEAL CALM WINDS 
OVER THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS...WITH LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS (LESS 
THAN 6 KNOTS OVER THE UPPER KEYS. WINDS ALONG THE REEF AND SOUTHERN 
FLORIDA BAY ARE LIGHT BETWEEN EAST AND SOUTHEAST...EXCEPT NORTHEAST 
AT PULASKI SHOAL. 

.FORECASTS...IN THE UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB) 598-600 DM AT 500 MB 
SYNOPTIC SCALE ANTICYCLONE PRESENTLY CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAIN STATES WILL GRADUALLY BUILD WESTWARD TO ENCOMPASS ALL OF THE 
WESTERN CONUS WITH 595-600 DM HEIGHTS...WITH JUST A BIT OF HEIGHT 
REDUCTIONS OVER THE NORTHEAST...AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL DIG 
SOUTHWARD OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST...REACHING THE 
SOUTHEASTERN STATES ON SATURDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR DRY AIR ABOVE 
700 MB TO MOVE OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS BY FRIDAY...AS A 595 DM UPPER 
RIDGE WILL BUILDS EAST OF THE BAHAMAS TO OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
KEYS FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

IN THE LOW AND MID-LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL REBUILD IN ACROSS NORTH 
FLORIDA AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...BEHIND TROPICAL STORM BERYL 
MOVING NORTHWARD OFF THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST. ON THE REGIONAL 
SCALE...THE LOW LEVEL PERTURBATION NOW ANALYZED OVER THE UPPER KEYS 
AND EASTERN STRAITS WILL TAKE ITS TIME MOVING WESTWARD ACROSS THE 
SERVICE AREA. A LIGHT AND VERY MOIST LOW AND MID-LEVEL 
ATMOSPHERE...WITH PWAT NEAR 2.00 INCHES WILL ALLOW FOR A CONTINUED 
GOOD CHANCE POP TO BE IN THE FORECAST FOR TODAY. AS A 
RESULT...MESOSCALE PROCESSES WILL BACK WINDS TO NORTHEAST (FROM JUST 
A FEW THOUSAND FEET OFF THE SURFACE TO BETWEEN 15 AND 20 KFT). LIKE 
YESTERDAY...THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS TO MOVE 
SOUTHWEST FROM MAINLAND FLORIDA TO OVER BAY AND GULF WATERS. 
BOUNDARIES OR ACTUAL SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL COLLIDE WITH ISLAND 
TCU-CUMULUS LINES OVER LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS LOCATIONS. IN 
ADDITION...LIKE YESTERDAY...THESE CELLS WILL HAVE NEGLIGIBLE 0 TO 6 
KM STORM MOTION...RESULTING IN THE POSSIBILITY OF LONGER PERIODS 
WITH MORE COPIOUS RAINFALL AMOUNTS ACROSS ISOLATED LOCATIONS IN THE 
ISLAND CHAIN. WITH SCATTERED COVERAGE...WILL HOLD WITH GOOD CHANCE 
POPS...AND THIS IS STILL SLIGHTLY BELOW LATEST 12 HOUR MAV NUMERICAL 
GUIDANCE FOR TODAY. ACTIVITY SHOULD REMAIN SCATTERED OVERNIGHT 
TONIGHT...WITH LESS ACTIVITY AFFECTING THE ISLANDS...SO WILL LEAVE 
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS ALONE FOR NOW. 

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...THE MAIN AXIS OF THE WAVE NOW 
LOCATED OVER HAITI WILL CONTINUE ITS MIGRATION WESTWARD...REACHING 
KEYS LONGITUDE LATE ON THURSDAY OR POSSIBLY FRIDAY. A WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY REBUILD ACROSS FLORIDA 
THEREAFTER. 00Z MAV AND NAM 12 HOUR RAIN CHANCES FOR THURSDAY ARE 
BETWEEN GOOD CHANCE AND LIKELY...AND WE ARE CARRYING MIDDLE OF THE 
ROAD CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. GFS SEEMS TO HINT THAT THE MAIN AXIS OF 
THIS WAVE MOVE ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY...AND THE LESS RELIABLE 
NAM IS NOW INDICATING IT COULD MOVE ACROSS ON FRIDAY. BECAUSE THE 
TIMING OF THE WAVE AXIS REMAINS A LITTLE TRICKY...WILL HOLD THE 
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS FOR NOW FOR THIS ENTIRE PERIOD.

SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BECOME ENTRENCHED ACROSS THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS AND INTO FLORIDA. 
DRIER AIR IN THE 850-700 MB LAYER WILL BE ADVECTED OVER THE ISLANDS. 
12 HOUR POPS HAVE FALLEN TO NEAR CLIMO FOR THE PERIOD...AND WILL 
HOLD WITH CLIMO POPS. GENTLE TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST FLOW WILL 
CONTINUE...AND THESE ARE INDICATIONS FOR EVEN LOWER(POSSIBLY 
ISOLATED) RAIN CHANCES IN THE EXTENDED. WILL HOLD WITH CLIMO POPS 
ATTM.  

&&

.MARINE...A LIGHT WIND FLOW PATTERN WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD BOATING 
CONDITIONS (OUTSIDE OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS) THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MARINERS CAN EXPECT HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS OR BAY 
WATERS WITHIN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BUILD ACROSS FLORIDA ON THURSDAY...AND REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE COMBINATION OF A BUILDING RIDGE TO THE NORTH 
WITH A WAVE ARRIVING IN THE KEYS SOMETIME THURSDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY...WILL PRODUCE SLIGHTLY HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS FOR THURSDAY 
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. MARINERS SHOULD CLOSELY MONITOR THE 
PROGRESS OF THE APPROACHING WAVE.   

&&

.AVIATION...VERY LIGHT WINDS FROM THE SURFACE TO 10000FT AGL SHOULD 
ALLOW SEA- BREEZE CIRCULATIONS TO DEVELOP ACROSS BOTH MAINLAND SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND THE FLORIDA KEYS...PARTICULARLY THE LOWER KEYS...BY 
16-18Z. THESE CIRCULATIONS WILL TAP INTO A MOISTURE-RICH AND

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS TROPICAL DEPRESSION TWO LOCATED 
ABOUT 200 MILES SOUTHEAST OF CAPE HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA...WITH A 
TROUGH REACHING SOUTHWARD INTO THE NORTHWEST BAHAMAS AND THE CAY SAL 
BANK. WITH THIS SURFACE TROUGH LYING BETWEEN A WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE AND A SMALL AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EAST CENTRAL GULF 
OF MEXICO...WINDS ACROSS OUR MARINE DISTRICT ARE LIGHT AND VARIABLE. 
MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING SCATTERED FALSE ECHOES IN THE 
FORM OF CHAFF OVER THE OUTER WATERS OF MAINLAND MONROE AND THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS...WITH AN ISOLATED SHOWER OVER THE LOWER KEYS. 
HOWEVER...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE PROPAGATING 
WESTWARD OVER DADE COUNTY. 

FORECAST:
A SUBTLE LOW LEVEL PERTURBATION EXTENDING FROM THE NORTHWEST BAHAMAS 
SOUTHWARD TO THE COAST OF CUBA WILL MIGRATE SLOWLY WESTWARD AND 
ACROSS OUR REGION WEDNESDAY...BEFORE EXITING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THEREAFTER...A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BRIEFLY 
NOSE INTO SOUTH FLORIDA THURSDAY...WHILE THE NORTHERN EXTENT OF AN 
EASTERLY WAVE PASSES ACROSS OUR AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY 
FRIDAY. HENCE...ABOVE NORMAL POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH FRIDAY. 

FOR THE BALANCE OF THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...EXPECT ANOTHER CLOUD 
LINE TO FORM NEAR PORTIONS OF THE ISLAND CHAIN WITH POSSIBLE OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES PUSHING OFF THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND. BECAUSE OF THESE 
CONCERNS...WILL INSERT A HIGH CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 

ON WEDNESDAY...THE COMBINATION OF AN ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE AND THE 
AFOREMENTIONED MINOR LOW LEVEL TROUGH PASSING THROUGH OUR REGION 
WILL PROMPT HIGH CHANCE POPS. 

EXTENDED FORECAST FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...A DEEP LAYERED 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...RESULTING IN A TYPICAL EASTERLY FLOW. BECAUSE OF THE 
WELL ESTABLISHED ANTICYCLONIC FLOW...WILL INSERT 30 PERCENT POPS 
ALONG WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

&&

.MARINE...
MARINERS SHOULD BE ALERT FOR POSSIBLE WATERSPOUTS AND WINDS AND SEAS 
HIGHER NEAR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING. 
OTHERWISE...LIGHT WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BECOMING LIGHT TO GENTLE 
WEDNESDAY AND PERSIST INTO THURSDAY...WITH NO ADVISORIES EXPECTED 
INTO THIS WEEKEND.

&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS WITH WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AS THE SEA BREEZES 
GET GOING. LIGHT EAST NORTHEASTERLY FLOW THROUGH THE LOWER

.DISCUSSION...
ANALYSIS...
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS COMBINED WITH A MORNING QUICKSCAT PASS 
DEPICTS A WEAK TROUGH EXTENDING FROM THE EXTREME NORTHWEST 
BAHAMAS...SOUTHWARD TO THE CUBAN COAST. ACROSS THE MARINE 
DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS INDICATE VARIABLE 
WINDS OF LESS THAN 5 KNOTS...WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING 
SCATTERED SMALL SHOWERS OVER THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE WATERS OF 
MAINLAND MONROE...AND JUST A FEW SMALL SHOWERS ON THE NEARSHORE 
WATERS SOUTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN. OTHERWISE...OUR MORNING SOUNDING 
REVEALS A TYPICAL MOIST (PWAT 1.74 INCHES) AND CONDITIONALLY 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH A LIGHT SOUTHEAST FLOW REACHING WELL INTO THE 
TROPOSPHERE. 

FORECAST...
BOTH GFS AND NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL 
BACK TO NORTHEAST BY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. GIVEN AMPLE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY...A FAVORABLE WIND PROFILE WILL SUPPORT 
CLOUD LINE FORMATION NEAR ISLAND COMMUNITIES. WITHIN THE EXPECTED 
CLOUD LINES...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD HAVE NO 
PROBLEM DEVELOPING. FURTHERMORE...WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED 
ATMOSPHERIC INGREDIENTS IN PLACE...THERE APPEARS TO BE A GOOD CHANCE 
FOR WATERSPOUTS ESPECIALLY ON THE NEARSHORE WATERS SURROUNDING THE 
LOWER KEYS. SINCE THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST SEEMS TO BE ON TRACK...NO 
ADJUSTMENTS ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME...BUT MAY UPDATE THE HAZARDOUS 
WEATHER OUTLOOK TO INSERT A MODERATE RISK FOR WATERSPOUTS.

TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND...WINDS SHOULD 
BACK TO MORE EASTERLY THIS AFTERNOON. HENCE...MOSTLY EAST WINDS OF

.DISCUSSION...IN THE UPPER LEVEL(500-200MB)...AS OF 200 AM...A NEAR 
600 DM(AT 500 MB) CENTER OF A LARGE SYNOPTIC SCALE ANTICYCLONE IS 
POSITIONED NEAR WESTERN KANSAS...WITH THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN EDGES 
OF THIS FEATURE NEAR THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
GULF OF MEXICO RESPECTIVELY. FARTHER EAST...A NARROW RIDGE SNAKES 
FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND WESTERN 
ATLANTIC...FROM ROUGHLY NEAR 40N 50W SOUTHWEST TO ACROSS SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. EAST OF THAT...A LARGE UPPER LOW IS POSITIONED 
A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES NORTH OF PUERTO RICO.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS(SURFACE TO 500 MB)...AS OF 200 AM...A 
STATIONARY FRONT TRAILS SOUTHWEST FROM BROAD AND WEAK LOW PRESSURE A 
FEW HUNDRED MILES EAST OF THE CAROLINAS. WEAK BUT BROAD HIGH 
PRESSURE IS POSITIONED OVER FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. WELL TO OUR 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE TROPICAL ATLANTIC AND CARIBBEAN...THE MAIN AXIS 
OF A TROPICAL WAVE IS PRESENTLY MOVING ACROSS PUERTO RICO. SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND THE KEYS LIE WITHIN A DEEP...MOIST...AND UNSTABLE LIGHT 
TO GENTLE EASTERLY FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO APPROX 30000 FEET...WITH 
PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) VALUES NEAR 2.00 INCHES.


.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 AM...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY OVER THE KEYS 
ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS. TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ISLAND 
CHAIN REMAIN IN THE MIDDLE 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MIDDLE 70S. KEY 
WEST RADAR HAS BEEN INDICATING A DECREASING TREND IN OVERALL SHOWER 
COVERAGE...AND AT PRESENT...JUST A FEW SMALL SHOWERS AND NO 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE BEING DETECTED ATTM. 10 METER WINDS ALONG THE 
FLORIDA REEF AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE AVERAGING BETWEEN 5 AND 9 
KNOTS FROM BETWEEN EAST AND SOUTHEAST...AND SOUTHEAST BETWEEN 5 AND 
10 MPH OVER THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS.


.FORECASTS...IN THE UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB) TODAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY...595-600 DM HEIGHTS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF 
OF THE CONUS...WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER 500 MB HEIGHTS...WITH WEAKER AND  
LIGHT ANTICYCLONIC FLOW NEAR 590 DM OVER FLORIDA AND THE KEYS.   

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...A DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES 
WILL AMPLIFY TO OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES ON SATURDAY NIGHT...AND 
POSSIBLY OVER FLORIDA ON SUNDAY...AS A STRONGER UPPER RIDGE...NEAR 
595 DM AT 500 MB BUILDS TO THE IMMEDIATE EAST OF THE BAHAMAS. UPPER 
WINDS WILL GRADUALLY VEER MORE TO THE SOUTHEAST...POSSIBLY ADVECTING 
SOME ADDITIONAL MOISTURE OVERHEAD FOR THE WEEKEND...BUT MODELS DO 
NOT DETECT LARGE SCALE LIFT ATTM.

IN THE LOW AND MID-LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 500 MB) TODAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL REMAIN WEAK AND EXTEND FROM SOUTH FLORIDA NORTHEAST TO 
THE CENTRAL NORTH ATLANTIC OCEAN. A VERY MOIST LOWER AND MIDDLE 
ATMOSPHERE...COMBINED WITH LIGHT TO GENTLE WINDS BETWEEN EAST AND 
NORTHEAST FROM THE SURFACE TO BETWEEN 700 AND 500 MB...WILL ALLOW 
FOR KEYS ISLAND AND SOUTH FLORIDA MESOSCALE PROCESSES TO DOMINATE. 
HAVE MIDDLE OF THE ROAD CHANCE POPS...AT 40 PERCENT...AND WONT 
DEVIATE FROM THAT...AND GFS 00Z 12 HR MAV POPS ARE WELL ABOVE THAT. 
WITH LIGHT WINDS...TROUGHING ON THE MAINLAND...AND ABUNDANT 
MOISTURE...MORE THAN ONE ROUND OF CUMULUS/TCU LINES NEAR THE ISLANDS 
SEEMS LIKELY TODAY.  

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...INDICATIONS CONTINUE IN THE LATEST 
00Z RUNS...FOR THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE TO STRENGTHEN JUST A BIT 
ACROSS THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND FLORIDA...WITH GENTLE TO MODERATE 
EAST TO SOUTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW STILL EXPECTED ACROSS THE KEYS. A 
TROPICAL WAVE...NOW NEAR PUERTO RICO...WILL APPROACH KEYS LONGITUDE 
SOMETIME ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH ADDITIONAL MOISTURE 
ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE WAVE LINGERING INTO FRIDAY. CURRENT MEX 12 
HOUR POP 
#S FOR THIS PERIOD ARE AROUND 50 PERCENT. WILL HOLD WITH MIDDLE OF 
THE ROAD POPS AT THE MOMENT.

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...ATLANTIC RIDGING WILL HOLD IN PLACE 
TO THE NORTH. THE CURRENT 00Z GFS RUNS ARE BEGINNING TO SUGGEST THAT 
DRIER AIR MAY EXIST BELOW 700 MB IN WHICH CASE CLIMO POPS MAY NEED 
TO BE INSERTED FOR THIS PERIOD. THE LATEST...MEX 12 HOUR POPS 
ALREADY SUPPORT THIS...BUT TOO FAR OUT AND NEED TO SEE MORE RUNS 
NECESSARY TO MAKE CHANGES NOW.  

&&

.MARINE...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...DO NOT SEE ANY ADVISORIES 
ATTM. MARINERS IN THE IMMEDIATE NEARSHORE GULF AND ATLANTIC 
WATERS...AND IN FLORIDA BAY WILL ENCOUNTER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WITHIN CUMULUS/TCU LINES. THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL DELIVER 
PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN ACCOMPANIED BY REDUCED VISIBILITY...GUSTY 
WINDS...AND DANGEROUS CLOUD TO WATER LIGHTNING STRIKES.

THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...A WEAK TROPICAL WAVE/LOW LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
APPROACH THE REGION ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...DELIVERING SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. LIGHT TO GENTLE BREEZES THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT WILL BECOME GENTLE TO MODERATE BREEZES ON THURSDAY CONTINUING 
UNTIL EARLY NEXT WEEK.

SHOULD ALLOW WELL-DEVELOPED SEA-BREEZE CIRCULATIONS TO DEVELOP 
ACROSS BOTH MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE FLORIDA

PENINSULA. THE RIDGE SEEMS WEAKER THAN THIS TIME 24 HOURS AGO. A 
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE CENTER IS SUGGESTED OVER THE EASTERN GULF...
AND THERE IS A COL REGION OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA SEPARATING THE 
TWO HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEMS. AS A RESULT...WINDS OVER FLORIDA BAY, THE 
UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS ARE CURRENTLY DRIVEN BY THE ATLANTIC 
RIDGE...WITH WINDS COMING IN FROM THE SE. A LIGHT NE WIND FLOW IS 
SEEN OVER LOWER KEYS AND GULF WATERS DUE TO INFLUENCE FROM THE GULF 
HIGH PRESSURE AREA. WIND SPEEDS ARE LIGHTER THAN EXPECTED...RUNNING 
5 KT OR SO...BUT 5-10 KT OVER THE UPPER KEYS. THE MORNING SOUNDING 
INDICATED A TYPICALLY MOIST AIRMASS FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 10 THSD 
FT...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER AT 1.8 INCH. RADAR CURRENTLY SHOWS 
DISORGANIZED ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE KEYS REGION...MAINLY NEAR THE 
ISLANDS AND IN THE STRAITS. NUMEROUS ECHOES OVER THE GULF NORTH OF 
DRY TORTUGAS AND THE MARQUESAS KEYS ARE FRESH CHAFF DROPS.

SOME FROM SE OVER THE UPPER KEYS...TO A MORE ENE OVER ALL THE

BE MORE FAVORABLE FOR OVER-ISLAND SHOWER AND POSSIBLY THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT. MAINLAND AFTERNOON CONVECTION DOES NOT HAVE ANY 
WELL-DEFINED STEERING FLOW FOR TODAY...BUT SOME OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES

KEY WEST SUNDAY EVENING SOUNDING USING A SFC T/TD OF 84F/75F. KEY 
WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS HAVE SHOWN A GRADUAL INCREASE IN CONVECTIVE 
CELL COVERAGE SINCE MIDNIGHT...WHICH IS TO BE EXPECTED IN MODERATE 
EASTERLY FLOW AS LOW-LEVEL CONFLUENT FLOW REPLACES DIFLUENT FLOW 
OVER OCEAN AREAS. SHOWERS RECENTLY PASSED THROUGH THE UPPER KEYS

UPPER KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS. SUBTLE CYCLONIC FLOW CAN ALSO BE 
DISCERNED FROM CONVECTIVE CELL MOVEMENT ON RADAR IMAGE LOOPS. THESE 
OBSERVATIONS SUGGEST THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK LOW-LEVEL TROUGH...AS 
ANTICIPATED BY THE AFTERNOON FORECASTER.

FORECAST:
PROGNOSTIC REASONING IS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS FORECAST CYCLES. A DEEP 
EASTERLY CURRENT WITH SOME WEAK EMBEDDED PERTURBATIONS AND 
ASSOCIATED FLUCTUATIONS IN MOIST LAYER DEPTH WILL PERSIST FOR THE 
NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. WEAK TO MODERATE CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY WITH 
LITTLE CONVECTIVE INHIBITION WILL CHARACTERIZE THE THERMODYNAMIC 
ENVIRONMENT...SO FLUCTUATIONS IN BOTH MOIST LAYER DEPTH AND 
LOW-LEVEL WIND WILL BE IMPORTANT FOR ASCERTAINING DAILY CONVECTIVE 
INITIATION...MOVEMENT...OUTFLOW TRAJECTORIES...AND ULTIMATELY 
RAINFALL COVERAGE ACROSS THE KEYS. 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES OF 40 
PERCENT WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH THE FORECAST AS SLIGHTLY DEEPER 
MOISTURE THAN AVERAGE IS ANTICIPATED WITH NEAR-NEUTRAL SYNOPTIC- 
SCALE VERTICAL MOTIONS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE WATERS 
SURROUNDING THE ISLAND CHAIN. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE MOSTLY CLEAR. WINDS OVER LAND ARE 
NORTHEAST TO EAST NEAR 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE EAST 
NEAR 10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. ONLY ABOUT FOUR 
DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO GENTLE EAST SURFACE 
WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT)...
IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TONIGHT. 
CLOSER TO THE KEYS...THE WESTERN EXTENT OF AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED NEAR THE BAHAMAS TONIGHT. IN THE UPPER 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN UPPER LEVEL TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE NORTH CENTRAL PORTION OF THE CARIBBEAN SEA...JUST 
SOUTH OF CUBA TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE...WITH 
A PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUE JUST ABOVE ONE AND THREE QUARTERS 
OF AN INCH. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD INCREASE TONIGHT. BY SUNRISE 
MONDAY...PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE JUST UNDER TWO INCHES. BE THAT AS IT 
MAY...THERE ARE TWO CONTRIBUTING FACTORS THAT SHOULD KEEP RAIN 
CHANCES BELOW CLIMATOLOGY VALUES TONIGHT. THE FIRST FACTOR IS LACK 
OF LARGE SCALE LIFT. THE SECOND FACTOR IS NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW 
ACROSS THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA FROM 2 KFT TO 10 KFT. THIS FLOW 
SHOULD SHIFT TO EAST TO SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT...BUT THAT SHOULD BE TOO 
LATE TO ADVECT SHOWERS FROM THE FLORIDA STRAITS OVER THE KEYS 
TONIGHT. THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE UPDATED TO 
REMOVE TRANSITIONAL WORDING AND TO LOWER POPS FOR THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD.     

&&

.MARINE...
NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS WILL BECOME EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST TONIGHT ON ATLANTIC WATERS. NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS NEAR 
10 KNOTS WILL BECOME EAST TO SOUTHEAST TONIGHT ON GULF AND FLORIDA 
BAY WATERS. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED TONIGHT 
THROUGH AT LEAST WEDNESDAY.

WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 12Z MONDAY. ISOLATED 
SHORT LIVED MVFR SHOWERS...WITH AN OCCASIONAL IFR THUNDERSTORM...
WILL MOVE WEST SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE. WIND

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE NOW APPEARS TO EXTEND FROM THE 
ATLANTIC WESTWARD OVER SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA...MAINTAINING A MAINLY 
EAST WIND FLOW OVER THE KEYS ALTHOUGH ISLAND AND REEF WINDS ARE 
STILL TENDING TO EAST-NORTHEAST DIRECTION AT TIMES. A VERY WEAK 
TROUGH MAY BE ALIGNED SOUTH-TO-NORTH OVER THE STRAITS JUST EAST OF 
THE KEYS AT THIS TIME. NASSAUS SURFACE WIND HAS GONE FROM EAST TO 
EAST-SOUTHEAST THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS...SUPPORTING SUCH A WEAK 
TROUGH AXIS. WIND SPEEDS ARE NEAR 10 KT AT THE REEF AND ON BAY AND 
GULF WATERS...BUT LIKELY STILL UP TO NEAR 15 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS 
AS WAS SHOWN ON A MORNING QUIKSCAT PASS. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS 
THE DRIEST PART OF THE DRY AIR ALOFT HAVING DEPARTED WEST FROM THE 
KEYS AT THIS TIME...WITH THE SOMEWHAT HIGHER PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES (1.8 INCH) NOW NOSING WEST OVER THE KEYS FROM THE BAHAMAS.
NASSAUS MORNING SOUNDING SUPPORTS MODELS INDICATIONS THAT THE 
SLIGHTLY MORE MOIST AIR IS DUE TO AN INCREASE IN THE MOIST AIR 
DEPTH...FROM SURFACE UP TO 850 MB THIS MORNING OVER THE KEYS...
TO A WET LAYER FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 700 MB. WITH A FAVORABLE LOW 
LEVEL WIND FROM THE ENE...AND THE ONSET OF SOME MORE DEPTH TO THE 
LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE...A WELL-DEFINED CU/TCU LINE FORMED THIS 
AFTERNOON OVER THE LOWER KEYS...AND LEAD TO SHOWERS JUST OVER THE 
EXTREME WESTERNMOST KEYS...GENERALLY FROM BIG COPPITT TO KEY WEST...
THENCE OVER THE WATER WELL TO THE WSW. 

.FORECAST...
I AM GOING TO STICK TO CONTINUITY OF THE ONGOING FORECAST PACKAGE.
IN GENERAL...THE GFS MODEL APPEARS MORE REASONABLE OVER THE COMING 
WEEK...WHILE THE NAM HAS EPISODES OF NOISY WEATHER PATTERNS. 

THE GFS HAS JUST SUBTLE PERIODS OF LOW LEVEL WIND FLOW CHANGES...
FROM E TO SE AND BACK AGAIN...AND BRIEF PASSING PERIODS OF A BIT 
LESS MOISTURE DEPTH AT TIMES BUT ON THE WHOLE A MOIST AIRMASS IS 
SHOWN TO BE OVER THE KEYS AT LEVELS FROM THE SURFACE TO 700 MB. 

TONIGHT...GFS IS CONSISTENT WITH A WEAK TROUGH PASSAGE WEST OVER THE 
KEYS TONIGHT...TAKING LOW LEVEL WIND FLOW FROM ENE TO ESE 
OVERNIGHT...AND BRINGING IN DEEPER MOISTURE FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 
700 MB WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES OF 1.8 TO 1.9 INCHES. THIS 
SLIGHTLY DEEPER MOISTURE HAS LEAD TO THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT OVER 
ANDROS ISLAND. MODELS HAVE 30 PCT POPS FOR TONIGHT...BUT FOR 
CONTINUITY I WILL KEEP THE ONGOING 40 PCT POPS...INDICATING THE MAIN 
THREAT WILL BE AFTER THIS EVENING. LEFT OVER CU-LINE SHOWERS WILL 
BOTH THE IMMEDIATE KEY WEST AREA FOR A LITTLE WHILE LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON HOWEVER...AND WITH MAINLAND-FIRED CONVECTION BEING STEERED 
TO THE WEST I WILL INDICATE SCATTERED COVERAGE OFF THE BAT FOR GULF 
AND BAY WATERS. 

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...A GENERAL ESE LOW LEVEL FLOW IS 
CHARACTERIZED IN THE GFS MODEL WITH SUBTLE UPS-AND-DOWNS OF MOISTURE 
DEPTH. THERE IS SOME INDICATION IN THE MODELS (MAINLY THE NAM) THAT 
A NE STEERING FLOW MAY SET UP TUESDAY AFTERNOON THAN COULD DRIVE 
MAINLAND CONVECTION TOWARD THE KEYS. THE NAM ALSO HAS A MID LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH SWINGING SOUTH TO SOUTH FLORIDA...BUT THE GFS DOES 
NOT. GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW A SLIGHT INCREASE IN LOCAL PRESSURE 
GRADIENT STARTING WEDNESDAY AS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE SHIFTS TO NORTH 
FLORIDA AND STARTS TO EXPAND...BUT THIS MAY DEPEND ON LOW PRESSURE 
DEVELOPMENT AND EVENTS EAST OF THE CAROLINAS IN THE MEANTIME. I WILL 
KEEP ONGOING 40 PERCENTERS IN PLACE FOR POPS.

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...THE GFS SHOWS A TROPICAL WAVE PASSAGE TO 
THE SOUTH OF THE KEYS...OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN...AND CONTINUITY WOULD 
SUGGEST THAT THIS IS THE WAVE CURRENTLY EAST OF THE LESSER ANTILLES. 
TIMING OF COURSE IS A GUESS AT THIS EARLY STAGE...BUT IN CASE THE 
GFS DOES HAVE A BALLPARK ARRIVAL FOR THE WAVE...I WILL KEEP WINDS AS 
HIGH FOR FRIDAY AS FOR THURSDAY...AND NOT SHOW A DROP AS THE GFS 
CURRENTLY SUGGESTS. 

SUNDAY...EXTENDED GFS SHOWS DRY AIR PUNCHING IN OVER THE KEYS IN 
WAKE OF A PASSING WAVE...BUT ITS TOO FAR OUT IN TIME FOR ANY 
CERTAINTY. 
&&

.MARINE...
A VERY WEAK TROUGH PASSING WEST OVER THE KEYS TONIGHT SHOULD TAKE 
ENE WINDS THIS EVENING...AND TURN THEM TO ESE LATER TONIGHT. LOOK 
FOR SPEEDS TO BE NEAR 10 KT OVER BAY AND GULF WATERS...AND NEAR 
ISLANDS TOO...BUT 10-15 KT IN THE STRAITS. A BOOST IN ESE WINDS MAY 
SET IN WEDNESDAY (BY ABOUT AN EXTRA 5 KT) AS HIGH PRESSURE STARTS TO 
EXPAND IN SIZE TO OUR NORTH. THIS MAY BE DELAYED DEPENDING ON LOW 
PRESSURE DEVELOPMENT OFF THE EAST COAST. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THIS EVENING INTO THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD 
ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE...AND AT THE KEYS 
TERMINALS. MAIN IMPACTS TO AVIATION WILL BE ISOLATED MVFR SHOWERS. 
THE STRONGER SHOWERS WILL BE FOUND ALONG AN ISLAND CLOUD LINE WHICH 
FORMED THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE LOWER KEYS...AND ALONG CONVECTIVE 
BOUNDARIES CREATED BY SEA BREEZE CONVECTION OVER SOUTH WEST FLORIDA. 
SURFACE WINDS OUTSIDE OF DIURNAL OR CONVECTIVE CIRCULATIONS...WILL 
BE MAINLY EASTERLY AT AROUND 10 KNOTS...BECOMING EAST SOUTHEASTERLY 
OVERNIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
A WEAKENING WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE IS POKING ACROSS CENTRAL 
FLORIDA AND INTO THE EAST CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...WHILE A MINOR 
TROUGH EXTENDS FROM THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS SOUTHWARD INTO EASTERN CUBA. 
MEANWHILE...GOES-12 WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A LENGTHY TROPICAL 
UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH (TUTT) STRETCHING FROM JUST SOUTH OF THE 
ISLAND OF CUBA...AND ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS AND 
WESTERN ATLANTIC. WITHIN THIS TUTT...A PRONOUNCED CYCLONIC 
CIRCULATION IS SEEN OVER EXTREME SOUTHEAST CUBA. CLOSER TO 
HOME...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS INDICATE EAST WINDS OF 10 
TO 15 KNOTS...WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING WIDELY SCATTERED 
SMALL SHOWERS OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS...WITH MOST ACTIVITY 
OCCURRING SOUTH OF A LINE BETWEEN THE SEVEN MILE BRIDGE AND FORT 
JEFFERSON NATIONAL PARK.

FORECAST:
A MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH (500-200 MB) WILL SETTLE SOUTHWARD 
THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES AND WESTERN ATLANTIC TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BEFORE BECOMING DIFFUSE OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND THE 
ADJACENT GULF AND ATLANTIC WATERS MONDAY NIGHT. AT THE SAME 
TIME...THE WESTERN EXTENT OF A TUTT OVER THE WEST CENTRAL CARIBBEAN 
SEA WILL RETROGRADE NORTHWESTWARD...WITH THE AXIS OF THE TROUGH NEAR 
OUR REGION TUESDAY MORNING. BECAUSE OF THE CHANGES ALOFT...A WEAK 
WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE REACHING INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA WILL 
RETREAT EASTWARD THROUGH TONIGHT...AS A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE DROPS 
INTO THE GULF COAST REGION. MEANWHILE...A VERY SUBTLE UNDULATION 
EXTENDING FROM THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE ISLAND OF 
CUBA WILL MIGRATE WESTWARD...AND ACROSS OUR REGION LATE TONIGHT AND 
MONDAY. HENCE...MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE 
WITH A VEERING AND DEEPENING SOUTHEAST FLOW SETTING UP OVERNIGHT AND 
PERSISTING THROUGH TUESDAY. 

FOR TODAY...CLOUD LINES WITHIN THE RATHER DEEP 
NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW WILL PROVIDE THE BEST CHANCE FOR ISOLATED 
SHOWERS ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN. HOWEVER...BOTH GFS AND NAM FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS REVEAL SOME DRIER AIR FILTERING IN ALOFT WHICH SHOULD 
LIMIT LIGHTNING STORMS. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH A DEEP LAYERED RIDGE EXTENDING 
FROM THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...A 
TYPICAL DEEP EASTERLY FLOW WILL PROVIDE ABOVE NORMAL PWAT VALUES 
SUPPORTING SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE POPS THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
OTHERWISE...NO DISCERNIBLE TROPICAL WAVES/PERTURBATIONS ARE ON THE 
HORIZON. 

&&

.MARINE...
NO CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS OR ADVISORIES WILL BE NECESSARY  
THROUGH MIDWEEK...WITH A LIGHT TO GENTLE EASTERLY FLOW PREVAILS ON 
KEYS WATERS. HOWEVER...MARINERS SHOULD ALWAYS BE ALERT FOR GUSTY 
WINDS NEAR STRONGER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL 
STRENGTHEN OVER EASTERN CUBA TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS 
UNSTABLE...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUE JUST BELOW ONE AND 
THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD DECREASE

AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH. DESPITE THIS EXPECTED DECREASE IN 
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE...I AM HESITANT TO DECREASE THE CHANCE OF 
RAINFALL FOR TONIGHT. THIS IS DUE TO DEEP EASTERLY FLOW IN PLACE 
COUPLED WITH A RECENT INCREASE IN CONVECTION OVER THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS. IN ADDITION...THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR 
EASTERN CUBA MAY CONTRIBUTE SOME UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE TO THE MIX.

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING REVEALED DEEP EASTERLY FLOW ALOFT... 
WITH MODERATELY STRONG FLOW IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE...45KT AT 
200MB. DEEP RIDGING JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS DOMINATES THE REGIONAL 
SYNOPTIC PATTERN. THE MORNING BALLOON WAS LAUNCHED NEAR SHOWERS AND 
THE RESULTING RAWINSONDE OBSERVATION INDICATES HIGHER MOISTURE IN 
THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE THAN WHAT IS REPRESENTATIVE OF THE LARGE-SCALE 
THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT. TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE 
PROBABLY CLOSER TO 1.5 INCHES AS SHOWN BY THE GEIGER KEY GPS-MET 
SENSOR AND A 12Z GOES-12 SATELLITE SOUNDING JUST SOUTH OF PELICAN 
SHOAL. CURRENT DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW PRIMARILY SHALLOW CONVECTIVE 
CELLS ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA WITH A MOTION VECTOR OF ABOUT 
090/18KT. SURFACE WINDS ACROSS THE AREA ARE MAINLY EAST 10-15KT...A 
LITTLE HIGHER OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA ACCORDING TO A MORNING 
SCATTEROMETER PASS. AIR TEMPERATURES HAVE ALREADY CLIMBED INTO 
MID-80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 73-75F RANGE.

FORECAST UPDATES WILL BE UNNECESSARY AT THIS TIME. ISOLATED SHOWERS 
IN MODERATE EASTERLY FLOW ARE EXPECTED FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. 
SUNSHINE WILL BE PLENTIFUL.

.MARINE...
MODERATE EAST BREEZES WILL PREVAIL...WITH HIGHEST WIND SPEEDS NEAR 
15KT OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA BEYOND THE REEF. ISOLATED SHOWERS 
WILL MOVE WEST NEAR 20MPH.

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL 
MOVE QUICKLY WESTWARD AT AROUND 15 KNOTS ACROSS THE ROUTE. THESE 
SHOWERS WILL BE SHORT LIVED...BUT THE STRONGER SHOWERS WILL PRODUCE 
WIND GUSTS NEAR 25 KNOTS AND BRIEF MVFR VISIBILITY. THERE IS 
POTENTIAL FOR ISLAND CLOUDLINE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON. SHOULD 
THIS LINE DEVELOP...A FEW HEAVY SHOWERS WILL FORM IN THE LEE OF THE 
LARGER ISLANDS AND WILL BE WITHIN THE VICINITY OF AT LEAST THE KEY

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
DESPITE PLENTY OF DRY AIR ABOVE THE MIXING LAYER...MODERATE TO FRESH 
EASTERLY WINDS BLOWING ACROSS WARM ATLANTIC WATERS HAS GENERATED 
WIDELY SCATTERED SMALL SHOWERS OVER OUR REGION. 
REGARDLESS...MARATHON AIRPORT HAS BEEN A PRECIPITATION MAGNET 
PICKING UP .37 INCHES IN A COUPLE OF SHOWER EPISODES. LATEST SURFACE 
ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE EXTENDING ACROSS CENTRAL 
FLORIDA AND INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...WITH A MINOR 
PERTURBATION MIGRATING WESTWARD THROUGH THE WINDWARD PASSAGE. 

CURRENTLY...LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING ISOLATED SHOWERS TRAVERSING 
WEST NORTHWEST THROUGH OUR AREA...WITH THE MOST ACTIVITY OCCURRING 
ON THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE WATERS SOUTH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 
KEYS. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM 
OBSERVATIONS INDICATE MOSTLY EAST WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS. 

FORECAST:
A WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE WILL EXTEND ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...BEFORE ERODING SOMEWHAT SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. 
THIS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE DROPPING 
SOUTHEASTWARD OFFSHORE OF THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES COAST. IN 
ADDITION...A MINOR UNDULATION OVER THE WINDWARD PASSAGE THIS MORNING 
WILL PROGRESS WESTWARD THIS WEEKEND...WITH THE NORTHERN EXTENT 
PASSING THROUGH OUR AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. SUBSEQUENTLY...OUR 
BRIEF SPELL OF BELOW NORMAL POPS WILL BECOME AVERAGE TONIGHT AND 
SUNDAY...BEFORE ABOVE NORMAL POPS RETURN SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.

IN WAKE OF THE MINOR TROUGH...AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED MID AND UPPER 
LEVEL ANTICYCLONE WILL BECOME WELL-ESTABLISHED OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
UNITED STATES AND THE ADJACENT WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN. BECAUSE OF 
THE AMPLIFYING MID AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGE...THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE WILL ONCE AGAIN BUILD ACROSS THE EXTREME 
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES AND FLORIDA PENINSULA FOR MOST OF NEXT WEEK. 
HENCE...THE COMBINATION OF A DEEP EASTERLY FLOW AND ANOTHER MINOR 
PERTURBATION PASSING THROUGH OUR REGION THURSDAY OR FRIDAY WILL 
PROMPT SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL POPS INTO EARLY NEXT WEEKEND. 

&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE TO FRESH EAST WINDS THIS MORNING...WILL BECOME GENTLE TO 
MODERATE THIS AFTERNOON AND PERSIST FOR THE BALANCE OF THIS WEEKEND. 
THEREFORE...AN EXERCISE CAUTION WILL BE MAINTAINED ON THE ATLANTIC 
WATER THIS MORNING UNTIL WINDS AND SEAS GRADUALLY DECREASE THIS 
AFTERNOON. LOOKING AT NEXT WEEK...A TYPICAL GENTLE TO MODERATE 
EASTERLY TRADE WIND SHOULD SETUP WITH NO ADVISORIES ANTICIPATED 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

&&

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED +SHRA ALONG THE

CURRENTLY...
KEYS SURFACE WINDS HAVE INCREASED SLIGHTLY OVER THE PAST COUPLE OF 
HOURS...RUNNING 14-18 KT SUSTAINED AT REEF SITES WITH GUSTS UP TO 24 
KT AT SAND KEY...THANKS TO THE LARGE HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE NW 
ATLANTIC TO THE SE STATES. NO QUIKSCAT PASS NOR SHIP REPORTS HAVE 
COME IN THIS EVENING OVER THE AREA...BUT WINDS MAY WELL BE EVEN A 
BIT STRONGER SOUTH OF THE KEYS OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA. 
MEANWHILE...THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING VERIFIED DRY AIR ALOFT 
STILL IN PLACE OVER THE KEYS...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER RELATIVELY 
LOW AT 1.5 INCH. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY SHOWS SIMILAR DRY AIR ALOFT 
EXTENDING EAST FROM THE KEYS TO THE NW BAHAMAS. NONETHELESS...A LINE 
OF PERSISTENT SHOWERS HAS MOVED WEST OFF THE WESTERN TIP OF ANDROS 
ISLAND...WITH THE LEADING SHOWERS IN THE LINE NOW PASSING THE SOUTH 
EDGE OF BIG PINE KEY TO SOUTH OF MARATHON...AND HEADING WEST. A FEW 
OF THE SHOWER TOPS HAVE MANAGED TO BUILD UP TO 25 THSD FT DESPITE 
THE DRY AIR ALOFT. 

FORECAST...
MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS ALL INDICATE THAT DRY AIR ALOFT SHOULD NOT 
CHANGE MUCH OVER THE KEYS THROUGH TONIGHT. CURRENT FORECAST OF 20 
PCT CHANCE OF RAIN COVERS THE SHOWER ACTIVITY NOW SEEN MOVING WEST 
OVER THE STRAITS TOWARD SOME OF THE MID AND LOWER KEYS. NO UPDATE 
WILL BE NEEDED FOR THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECASTS.
&&

.MARINE...
TONIGHT THE EAST WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BLOW NEAR 15 KT...EXCEPT 
15-20 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS WHERE SMALL CRAFT SHOULD EXERCISE 
CAUTION DUE TO THE WINDS AND SEAS. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE ATLANTIC 
WELL TO OUR NORTH SHOULD CONTINUE TO DRIVE LOCAL WINDS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS

ANALYSIS:
AN UPPER-AIR COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS AFTERNOON REVEALS DEEP EASTERLY 
FLOW IN PLACE ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...WITH A DEEP SLICE OF DRY AIR 
BETWEEN THE MIXED LAYER AND THE CIRRUS LAYER. THE GPS-MET SENSOR ON 
GEIGER KEY INDICATES A NEARLY CONTINUOUS DROP IN INTEGRATED 
PRECIPITABLE WATER DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS. LATEST DOPPLER RADAR 
SCANS SHOW RAIN-FREE CONDITIONS EAST OF A LINE FROM CAPE SABLE TO 
THE SEVEN MILE BRIDGE TO VARADERO IN CUBA...AND ONLY ISOLATED 
SHOWERS WEST OF THIS LINE...MAINLY IN THE VICINITY OF THE DRY 
TORTUGAS. 

CURRENTLY...AIR TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE THE UPPER 80S IN MOST ISLAND 
COMMUNITIES WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S. SKIES ARE PARTLY 
CLOUDY...POPULATED WITH CONSIDERABLE CIRRUS AND SCATTERED TRADE WIND 
TYPE CUMULUS. MODERATE TO FRESH EAST BREEZES ARE BLOWING AT MOST 
PLATFORMS.

FORECAST:
PROGNOSTIC REASONING HAS CHANGED LITTLE FROM THAT PRESENTED BY THE 
OVERNIGHT FORECASTER. A RIDGE IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE WILL REMAIN 
NORTH OF THE KEYS FOR THE NEXT WEEK...WITH SOME FLUCTUATIONS IN 
STRENGTH AND POSITION. DEEPER MOISTURE SHOULD RETURN BY LATE IN THE

THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING REVEALED A MUCH DRIER AND MORE STABLE 
AIR MASS IN PLACE ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA THAN WHAT WAS OBSERVED 24 
HOURS AGO. USING A SFC T/TD OF 84/74...MLCAPE WAS ONLY 399 J/KG. THE 
SFC-700MB LAYER MEAN DEWPOINT DEPRESSION WAS 10C. HOWEVER...IT WAS 
STILL MOIST IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER WITH NEAR ZERO CONVECTIVE

SFC-700MB LAYER MEAN WIND WAS 120/16KT. HENCE...THE ISOLATED 
FAST-MOVING SHOWERS ON RADAR.

CURRENT FORECASTS ARE SOUND. DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT WILL LIMIT SHOWER 
STRENGTH...DURATION...AND COVERAGE...AND LIMITED INSTABILITY WILL 
KEEP THE THUNDER THREAT VERY LOW THIS AFTERNOON. FRESH EAST BREEZES 
WILL PREVAIL OVER WATER.

REPORTS FROM THE FLORIDA REEF AND BAY C-MAN SITES WERE IN 
AGREEMENT...AS WAS A SHIP OF OPPORTUNITY SOUTH OF COSGROVE SHOAL AT 
8AM. SO...THE FRESHENING EAST BREEZE HAS SET IN AS FORECAST...AND A 
SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINE WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR

AFTER A SHORT SPELL OF SCATTERED SHOWERS TRAVERSING NORTHWEST 
THROUGH THE ISLAND COMMUNITIES...ACTIVITY HAS BEEN ON THE WANE ON 
THE EASTERN HALF OUR REGION OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS WITH DRIER 
AIR FILTERING IN FROM THE EAST. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A

FORECAST:
AN EXTENSIVE DEEP LAYERED (1000-500 MB) RIDGE STRETCHING FROM THE 
SOUTHERN CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES INTO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL 
BECOME SEVERED ALONG THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES COAST THIS WEEKEND. 
THIS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO AN UNUSUALLY VIGOROUS MID AND UPPER

.CURRENTLY...
THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING INDICATED THAT DEEP MOISTURE WAS STILL 
OVERHEAD...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER OF 2.15 INCHES. HOWEVER...LATEST 
SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THE SIGNIFICANTLY DRIER AIR 
ALOFT TO OUR EAST HAS CONTINUED TO CREEP WEST...AND BETWEEN THINNING 
CIRRUS SHIELDS THE DRIER AIR APPEARS TO HAVE PROGRESSED INTO THE 
STRAITS SOUTH OF THE KEYS. OVERALL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE 
HAS SIGNIFICANTLY DECREASED FROM THE AFTERNOON...BUT HAS NOT BEEN 
ELIMINATED AS ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE STILL POPPING UP IN THE STRAITS.
THE EVENING SOUNDING MEASURED WINDS AT 1 THSD FT AGL EAST AT 9 KT...
BUT RECENTLY THE DOPPLER WIND PROFILE SHOWS 1 THSD FT AGL WINDS 
HAVING INCREASED TO 15 KT. EARLY EVENING WINDS WERE PARTLY DISRUPTED 
FROM THE RAIN-COOLED AIR...BUT THAT EFFECT IS FADING WHILE AT THE 
SAME TIME THE LONG-EXPECTED INCREASE IN PRESSURE GRADIENT MAY BE 
SETTING IN. 

.FORECAST...
LATEST MODEL DATA STILL SHOWS DRYING AROUND 850 MB AND UPWARDS WILL 
SET IN OVER THE KEYS AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. PUBLIC ZONES WILL BE 
UPDATED TO REMOVE THE HIGHER EVENING CHANCES OF RAIN...WITH NO 
CHANGES IN THE CURRENTLY STATED PROSPECTS FOR LESSENING CLOUD COVER 
AND SLIGHT CHANCES OF RAIN OVERNIGHT. 
&&

.MARINE...
AS A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH MOVES FARTHER AWAY TO THE WEST...AND 
ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH ASSERTS ITSELF...THEN EAST WINDS

ANALYSIS:
A COMPOSITE ANALYSIS OF THE REGIONAL LOWER TROPOSPHERE AT 18Z SHOWS 
A WEAK TROUGH LINE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO ABOUT 200 
MILES WEST OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. A RIDGE LINE EXTENDED WEST-SOUTHWEST 
FROM A LARGE ANTICYCLONIC CIRCULATION CENTERED OVER THE NORTH 
ATLANTIC...EXTENDING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF COAST. WIND SPEEDS OF 
20-25KT IN THE 1000-700MB LAYER WERE ANALYZED OVER MUCH OF THE 
BAHAMAS...WITH WIND SPEEDS LESS THAN 10KT ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO NEAR THE TROUGH LINE. THE KEYS WERE POSITIONED 
BETWEEN THE TWO WIND SPEED REGIMES IN A ZONE OF APPARENT MASS SPEED 
CONVERGENCE. CONVECTIVE RAIN WAS WIDESPREAD OVER THE SERVICE AREA 
EARLIER THIS MORNING WITH PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER. LARGE AREAS OF 
STRATIFORM RAIN THEN DEVELOPED AS CONVECTIVE CLOUDS SPREAD OUT 
RAPIDLY IN THE MOIST AIR MASS. HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE JUST NOW 
STRUGGLING TO GET TO THE MID 80S. A DISTINCT MID-TROPOSPHERIC 
CYCLONIC VORTICITY CENTER WAS ANALYZED OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA 
BOTH AT 12Z AND 18Z. THIS SYSTEM MAY HAVE ORIGINATED AS A MESOSCALE 
VORTICITY CENTER INDUCED BY CONVECTION OVER THE BAHAMAS YESTERDAY... 
PERHAPS HAVING MIGRATED WESTWARD AND ENHANCED LOCAL CONVECTION 
TODAY...OR...IT MAY HAVE ACTUALLY BEEN INDUCED BY THE CONVECTION 
EARLIER THIS MORNING.  IT IS DIFFICULT TO SAY FOR SURE. 
NEVERTHELESS...PRIMARY FORCING FOR THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY TODAY 
SEEMS CLEARLY RELATED TO LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IN 
RAPIDLY DECELERATING TRADE WIND FLOW EAST OF THE GULF TROUGH LINE.

FORECAST:
AFTER A HIGHER-THAN AVERAGE CHANCE OF RAINFALL THIS EVENING...A 
STRENGTHENING LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE WILL FORCE THE DRIER 
AIR CURRENTLY OVER THE BAHAMAS INTO THE KEYS OVERNIGHT...ALONG WITH 
FRESHENING EAST BREEZES.

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY WILL FEATURE A TRADE-WIND TYPE REGIME WITH 
FRESH EAST BREEZES..FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS CLOUDS...AND ISOLATED 
PASSING SHOWERS.

MOISTURE WILL BE ON THE INCREASE THROUGH A DEEPER PORTION OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE BY SUNDAY AND MONDAY...AND WE WILL LOOK FOR PERTURBATIONS 
IN THE LOW-LEVEL EASTERLY FLOW TO MODULATE DAILY RAIN CHANCES. AN 
EASTERLY FLOW REGIME IS LIKELY TO PERSIST THROUGH THURSDAY WITH 
NEAR-CLIMO TEMPERATURES AND RAIN CHANCES...AND ABOVE CLIMO WIND 
SPEEDS.

1000 PM EDT WED JUL 12 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK TROPICAL WAVE OR SURFACE TROUGH AXIS APPEARS TO BE WEST OF 
THE LOWER KEYS...OVER ADJACENT GULF OF MEXICO WATERS...CONTINUING TO 
MOVE WEST. KEYS WINDS HAVE TURNED MAINLY TO THE SE NOW...BUT AN 
EARLIER WIND SURGE THAT FOLLOWED THE WAVE THROUGH THE BAHAMAS HAS 
LOST SOME PUNCH AND WIND SPEEDS ARE LAGGING BEHIND EXPECTATIONS OVER 
THE KEYS. LATEST C-MAN OBSERVATIONS GENERALLY SHOW WINDS IN THE 
10-15 KT RANGE ON THE REEF. THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING SHOWED 
VERY MOIST AIR STILL IN PLACE OVERHEAD...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER AT 
2.31 INCHES. OVERALL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE HAS WANED 
CONSIDERABLY DURING LATE AFTERNOON AND INTO THIS EVENING...WITH 
DOPPLER RADAR CURRENTLY SHOWING ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND 
THE LOWER KEYS...AND WATERS NORTH AND WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS...
GENERALLY ALONG AND JUST EAST OF THE ESTIMATED WAVE/TROUGH AXIS. 
HOWEVER...A LARGE CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS IS 
CREEPING WEST OVER WATERS BETWEEN ANDROS ISLAND AND THE UPPER KEYS...
BUT IS HAVING TROUBLE MAKING MUCH PROGRESS TOWARD THE UPPER KEYS. 
VERY DRY AIR ALOFT IS SEEN ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY OVER THE SE 
BAHAMAS...JUST APPROACHING NASSAU AND THE SE EDGE OF ANDROS ISLAND. 

.FORECAST...
THE 18Z INTERMEDIATE RUNS OF BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATE 
PRECIPITATION FIELDS OF OVER .25 INCH AFFECTING THE KEYS DURING THE 
LATTER HALF OF TONIGHT (06Z TO 12Z)...WITH BOTH MODELS SHOWING AN 
AREA OF DEEP LAYER LIFT AND CONTINUED HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT. DESPITE
SIGNIFICANT UVV FIELDS AND MODEL CALCULATIONS OF HIGH LEVEL 
DIVERGENCE OVER THE KEYS...WIND FIELDS ALOFT ARE SHOWN TO BE RATHER 
WEAK. CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR PRECIP COVERAGE DURING THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD...BUT SINCE MODELS CONTINUE TO PRODUCE SIGNS OF REGENERATING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...I WILL PROBABLY NOT UPDATE LOCAL ZONE 
FORECASTS. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WIND SURGE IS LAGGING A BIT BEHIND A WEAK TROPICAL WAVE OR SURFACE 
TROUGH THAT PASSED THE KEYS THIS EVENING...BUT A PICK UP OF 
SOUTHEAST WINDS TO NEAR 15 KT IS STILL EXPECTED OVERNIGHT ON KEYS 
WATERS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS. WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE ROUTE...MAINLY AFTER 06Z...PRODUCING 
MVFR CONDITIONS AND BRIEF IFR VISIBILITIES IN STRONGER CELLS. 
SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE GENERALLY SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 
10 KNOTS.

300 PM EDT WED JUL 12 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB). AS OF 200 
PM...A WESTERN ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED NEAR 28N 72W...WITH 
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS HIGH EXTENDING TO OFF NORTH FLORIDA. A 
WEAK AND SMALL SCALE LATITUDINAL UPPER TROUGH CAN BE ANALYZED ACROSS 
THE EASTERN FLORIDA STRAITS. FARTHER TO THE WEST...AN UPPER LOW 
PRESSURE AREA IS NOW CENTERED JUST NORTHWEST OF THE YUCATAN 
PENINSULA. SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS LIE BENEATH VERY 
MOIST...CYCLONIC AND SOMEWHAT UPPER DIFFLUENT FLOW.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...A FEW THOUSAND MILES TO EAST 
SOUTHEAST...A WEAK WAVE IS LOCATED A FEW HUNDRED MILES EAST OF THE 
WINDWARD ISLANDS...MOVING WEST. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...THE WESTERN 
EXTEND OF A 1025 MB RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CURRENTLY EXTENDS ACROSS 
NORTH FLORIDA. THE MAIN AXIS OF AN APPROACHING WEAK LOW LEVEL TROUGH 
IS CENTERED OVER THE CAY SAL BANK MIDWAY BETWEEN THE KEYS AND ANDROS 
ISLAND. THE MIDDLE AND UPPER FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN A VERY MOIST 
SOUTHEAST FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO 25 KFT.

&&

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES SKIES 
ARE CLOUDY OVER THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS. 
LATEST RADAR IMAGERY FROM KEY WEST AND MIAMI DEPICT A LARGE AREA OF 
RAIN WITH EMBEDDED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF THIS AREA. 
SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE LOWER KEYS AND ADJOINING GULF AND 
ATLANTIC WATERS...AS WELL AS ACROSS THE GULF WATERS 20 TO 60 NM WEST 
OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY...WITH JUST ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS 
HERE. TEMPERATURES IN THE RAIN COOLED UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS ARE 
STRUGGLING TO REACH THE MIDDLE 80S...WITH TEMPERATURES BETWEEN 85 
AND 90 ACROSS THE LOWER KEYS. THE OVERALL SURFACE WINDS HAVE DROPPED 
OFF CONSIDERABLY OUTSIDE OF THE CONVECTION IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE 
APPROACHING TROUGH AXIS. C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE REEF AND FLORIDA 
BAY ARE SOME COMPONENT OF EAST BUT LESS THAN 10 KNOTS...WITH 
ISOLATED GUSTS BETWEEN 20 AND 30 KNOTS OCCURRING IN THE HEAVIEST 
SHOWERS.

&&

.FORECAST...

.IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(200-700 MB)...UPPER LOW PRESSURE OVER 
THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO WILL CONTINUE MOVING WEST...CROSSING THE 
MEXICAN COAST LATE THURSDAY. A DEEP AND WARM LARGE SCALE UPPER RIDGE 
WILL SET UP SHOP FROM THE CENTRAL CONUS EASTWARD TO OFF THE 
MID-ATLANTIC COAST...INCLUDING THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES...WITH THE 
FLORIDA KEYS REMAINING ALONG THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THIS DEEP 
RIDGING FOR THIS WEEKEND THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. 

.IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...TONIGHT...DUE TO THE 
SLOWNESS OF THE APPROACHING WEAK WAVE/TROUGH...THE LEADING EDGE OF 
THE AFOREMENTIONED LARGE AREA OF RAINFALL WITH EMBEDDED SHOWERS AND 
STORMS WILL TAKE ITS TIME ENTERING INTO THE SERVICE AREA...BUT 
SHOULD BE ACROSS ALL OF THE LOWER KEYS BY 600 PM. WILL MAINTAIN 
LIKELY RAIN CHANCES OVERNIGHT. SLOW MOVING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
HAVE ALREADY DEPOSITED RAINFALL AMOUNTS BETWEEN ONE AND TWO INCHES 
OF RAIN IN THE NORTHERNMOST UPPER KEYS...AND WITH AN ADDITIONAL ONE 
TO TWO INCHES EXPECTED...A FLOOD ADVISORY HAS BEEN ISSUED FOR THE 
UPPER KEYS UNTIL 330 PM. WEAK DIVERGENCE ALOFT WILL STILL SUPPORT 
SOME ISOLATED WIND GUSTS OVERNIGHT...BUT MOST GUSTS SHOULD REMAIN 
BELOW WARNING CRITERIA. WILL ADD HEAVY RAIN WORDING TO ZFP. EXPECT 
THE MAIN TROUGH AXIS TO PASS WEST OF THE KEYS SOMETIME THIS 
EVENING...AFTER WHICH WINDS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE TO NEAR 15 KNOTS 
ON THE WATERS.

THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...ALL MODELS INDICATE GRADUALLY 
STRENGTHENING OF THE LOW-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTH...WITH AN INCREASE 
IN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE RIDGE AND SOME WEAKER LOWER 
LEVEL PERTURBATIONS THAT WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA. 
MODELS INDICATE SOME DECENT LOW TO MID LEVEL LIFT IN THE 850-700 
LAYER THROUGH 00Z FRIDAY. THE LATEST 12 HOUR MOS POPS #S ARE STILL 
RUNNING AROUND 50 PERCENT. WILL ELECT TO CONTINUE WITH 40 PERCENT 
POPS WE HAVE. WINDS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF REMAIN NEAR 15 KNOTS AND 
GUSTY.

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE SHOULD 
BECOME WELL ESTABLISHED AT THIS TIME ACROSS FLORIDA. MODELS INDICATE 
FURTHER DRYING WITHIN THE BOUNDARY LAYER...WITH THE DEEPEST MOISTURE 
NOW REALLY CONFINED TO BELOW 850 MB. WE ARE STILL CARRYING CLIMO 
POPS FOR THIS PERIOD ATTM...BUT LATEST 12 HOUR MAV POP #S ARE 
SUPPORTIVE OF ONLY JUST ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST. THE 12 
HOUR NAM POPS ARE QUITE HIGH AND NOT REPRESENTATIVE OF THE SYNOPTIC 
SCENARIO FOR THIS PERIOD.

SUNDAY AND MONDAY...THE WAVE CURRENTLY ANALYZED A FEW HUNDRED MILES 
EAST OF THE WINDWARD ISLANDS SHOULD REACH KEYS LONGITUDE BY SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY. THIS WOULD SUPPORT HIGHER POP #S...BUT THE 12 HOUR MEX 
POP #S HAVE FALLEN A BIT FROM THE LAST RUN. WILL HOLD WITH 40%.

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY....THE WAVE SHOULD BE WEST OF KEYS 
LONGITUDE...AND NO ADDITIONAL TROUGHS OR PERTURBATIONS ARE FORESEEN 
THIS FAR OUT. THE MEX #S ARE AROUND 30 PERCENT...WHICH IS RIGHT NEAR 
CLIMO. WILL LEAVE THESE LAST TWO DAYS AT CLIMO.

&&

.MARINE...WILL SEE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS 
CONTINUE TO SPREAD SLOWLY WESTWARD THROUGH THE COURSE OF THE LATE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. EXPECT SOME ISOLATED WIND GUSTS TO 30 
KNOTS. SURFACE WINDS WILL INCREASE TO NEAR 15 KNOTS DURING TONIGHT 
AND ON THURSDAY. THE STRENGTHENING WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE ACROSS FLORIDA WILL ALLOW FOR WINDS AND SEAS TO INCREASE 
SLIGHTLY WITH MODERATE TO FRESH EASTERLY TRADES FRIDAY THROUGH 
SATURDAY. SMALL CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINES WILL BE LIKELY FOR 
THE ATLANTIC WATERS FOR THIS PERIOD. ANOTHER WAVE WILL APPROACH THE 
WATERS SUNDAY AND MONDAY POSSIBLY INCREASING SHOWER ACTIVITY AT THAT 
TIME.

&&

.AVIATION...SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
OCCUR THROUGH EARLY TONIGHT ...PRODUCING MVFR TO IFR CIGS AND/OR VIS 
ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE. WIND GUSTS OF AROUND 30 KNOTS WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE STRONGER CONVECTIVE CELLS. OTHERWISE...SOUTHEAST 
SURFACE WINDS OF 10 TO OCCASIONALLY 15 KNOTS CAN BE EXPECTED AT THE 
KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS.

BE THE NEXT RAIN-MAKER...AFFECTING OUR WEATHER TOMORROW AND TOMORROW 
NIGHT BEFORE MOVING WEST OF US ON THURSDAY. LATEST 12 HOUR NUMERICAL 
#S FOR THIS SYSTEM CONTINUE TO DEPICT GOOD CHANCE TO LIKELY 12 HOUR 
#S TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...WITH #S AROUND 50 PERCENT IMMEDIATELY 
BEHIND WAVE PASSAGE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EVEN ON THURSDAY.

TONIGHT...THOUGH MODELS ARE INDICATING SOME DIVERGENCE  
AROUND...CURRENTLY ONLY HAVE ISOLATED ECHOES IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS 
OFFSHORE OF THE KEYS...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER 
FLORIDA BAY AND ACROSS THE WESTERN STRAITS. THE LATEST SATELLITE 
IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THERE MAY BE SOME DRY AIR MOVING TOWARDS THE 
KEYS TONIGHT OUT AHEAD OF THE WAVE NOW LOCATED IN THE CENTRAL 
BAHAMAS. WILL KEEP POPS AT 40 PERCENT.  

ON WEDNESDAY...BELIEVE THAT 12 HOUR #S IN THE LIKELY CATEGORY MAY BE 
A BIT HIGH...AS MOST OF THE SHOWERS SHOULD BE ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE WAVE. WE HAVE GOOD CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST...AND NOT REALLY 
INCLINED TO LOWER POPS FURTHER. THIS IS SUFFICIENTLY BELOW MOS

WEDNESDAY NIGHT...LOOKS LIKE THE WAVE WILL BE PASSING BY...THINK 
THAT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE IMPACTING 
THE AREA. SURFACE WINDS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WILL BE MORE 
FROM THE SOUTHEAST. WILL HOLD WITH 40 PERCENT POPS ALREADY IN THE 
FORECAST.

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL GRADUALLY BUILD NORTH OF FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. WITH 
THE MID AND UPPER DRYING...MOISTURE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE 
CONFINED TO BELOW ABOUT 800 MB. THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL 
LIKELY INCREASE. WE ARE INDICATING 10 TO 15 MPH WINDS IN THE PUBLIC 
FORECAST...BUT WIND SPEEDS MAY BE HIGHER AT NIGHT. THERE ARE NO 
DISCERNIBLE LOW LEVEL TROUGHS OR PERTURBATIONS MOVING ACROSS THE 
KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS FOR THIS PERIOD. 12 HOUR POP #S HAVE 
FALLEN TO BETWEEN 15 AND 30 PERCENT FOR THIS PERIOD...AND CLIMO IS 
NOW AT 31 AND 32 PERCENT FOR KEYW AND KMTH. WILL HOLD WITH LOW 
CHANCE (30) POPS(CLIMO) FOR THAT TIME.

EXTENDED...(SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...DESPITE THE MODELS 
INDICATING THE MAINTENANCE OF STRONG RIDGING...12 HOUR POPS #S RISE 
UP TO NEAR 50 PERCENT FOR THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS 
MIGHT BE THE VARIOUS MODELS PICKING UP ON SEVERAL 
PERTURBATIONS...WEAK TROUGHS...INCLUDING THE PRESENT WAVE OUT NEAR 
50W THAT IS PROGGED TO PASS BY OUR LONGITUDE ON SUNDAY NIGHT. HAVE 
INHERITED SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL POPS THROUGH THIS PERIOD...AND WILL 
WAIT ANOTHER DAY BEFORE DECIDING TO LOWER THIS.

&&

.MARINE...EXPECTED GREATER COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH INCREASED MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE WAVE 
THAT WILL BE MOVING BY THE FLORIDA STRAITS ON WEDNESDAY...AND BEHIND 
THE WAVE AXIS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. IN ADDITION...WINDS AND SEAS WILL 
GRADUALLY BUILD THIS EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AS HIGHER 
PRESSURE BUILDS TO THE NORTH OF THE KEYS. CONDITIONS COULD BE 
MARGINALLY FAVORABLE FOR SCEC...ESPECIALLY ON THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS...BUT AM NOT EXPECTING ANY ADVISORIES THROUGH THE NEXT TWO 
DAYS. 

WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE ON ALL WATERS ON FRIDAY...AS THE 
RIDGE BUILDS NORTH OF THE KEYS. HAVE INDICATED 15 KNOTS AND GUSTY 
FOR FRIDAY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...BUT LATEST 12Z MAV #S INDICATE THAT 
SPEEDS COULD BE SOLIDLY IN THE SCEC CRITERIA. DO NOT WANT TO JUMP ON 
THIS QUITE YET.

&&

.AVIATION...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE SCATTERED IN COVERAGE 
ON THE MAINLAND LEG OF THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE...THROUGH 
ABOUT 00Z (800 PM). FOR THE BALANCE OF THE EVENING ONLY ISOLATED 
SHOWERS ARE LIKELY THROUGHOUT THE ROUTE.

.UPDATE...
A ROUND OF UPDATES WILL BE MADE TO THE COASTAL WATERS AND PUBLIC 
ZONES TO RAISE COVERAGE AND POPS INTO THE NUMEROUS/LIKELY CATEGORY. 
UPPER DIVERGENCE HAS SET UP IN THE SOUTHEAST PORTION OF THE STRAITS 
ALLOWING FOR NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BLOSSOM EARLY. 
STEERING OUT OF THE EAST SOUTHEAST WILL PUSH THESE STORMS INTO THE 
COASTAL WATERS AND LIKELY TO THE KEYS LATER TODAY. MARINERS SHOULD 
BE CAREFUL TODAY...IN SPITE OF FAVORABLE WINDS AND SEAS THE NUMEROUS 
SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BRING DEADLY LIGHTNING AND LOCALLY GUSTY 
WINDS.

NORTHWEST...PASSING THROUGH THE KEYS LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY 
WEDNESDAY. DEEP STEERING WILL BECOMING MORE SOUTHEAST IN THE WAKE OF 
THE TROUGH WITH HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATERS...THEN WEAKENING BY 
THURSDAY. THE PROXIMITY OF THE UPPER LOW TO THE APPROACHING TROUGH 
MAY ENHANCE THE TROUGH AS IT PASSES...AND BUMPED UP POPS TO 50 
PERCENT. GFS MOS HAS BEEN TRENDING POPS UPWARDS AS WELL. 11/00Z NAM

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
930 PM EDT MON JUL 10 2006

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED A MOIST AND MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS WITH A MLCAPE OF 1082 J/KG AND A MIXING RATIO OF 
14.0 G/KG IN THE MIXED LAYER. CONVECTIVE INHIBITION WAS FAIRLY 
WEAK...AROUND 11 J/KG. GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS OF 20-30 METERS 
WERE NOTED IN THE 300-150MB LAYER DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS...ALONG 
WITH A STEEPENING MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATE OF 6.4 C/KM. THESE CHANGES 
ARE NO DOUBT ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK...SYNOPTIC-SCALE ASCENT FORCED BY 
THE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE CURRENTLY EVIDENT IN GOES-12 MOISTURE 
CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...JUST WEST 
OF THE DRY TORTUGAS. AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS INDICATES A 
CLOSED CIRCULATION FROM 100-400MB WITH A TROUGH/SHEAR ZONE 
500-700MB. THERE WAS NO EVIDENCE OF A REFLECTION OF THIS CYCLONE 
BELOW 700MB...AND IT WAS NOT ALL THAT MOIST BELOW 700MB...WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF THE NEAR-SURFACE LAYER.

CURRENT DOPPLER RADAR SCANS ARE SHOWING ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA WITH A MEAN MOTION VECTOR OF 
ABOUT 100/11KT. SURFACE WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING MAINLY OUT OF THE 
EAST AT 10-15K FOR THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS. AIR TEMPERATURES IN MOST 
ISLAND COMMUNITIES ARE HOLDING IN THE LOWER 80S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
THE LOWER 70S.

THE FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK...WITH CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS AND 
SCATTERED SHOWER/ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT.
&&

.MARINE...
NO ADVISORIES OR HEADLINES.  ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE 
LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS ALONG WITH OCCASIONAL TO FREQUENT 
LIGHTNING STRIKES OVERNIGHT.
&&

.AVIATION...
ISOLATED IFR THUNDERSTORMS AND MVFR SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE 
WESTWARD ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE THROUGH THE 
OVERNIGHT PERIOD. A COUPLE OF ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE 
THUNDERSTORMS MAY AFFECT THE KEYS TERMINALS. SURFACE WINDS WILL 
GENERALLY BE EASTERLY AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
300 PM EDT MON JUL 10 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB) LATEST 
SATELLITE IMAGERY AND OBSERVATIONS INDICATES A TROUGH OVER THE 
MID-ATLANTIC AND NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THE BASE OF THIS 
FEATURE HAS RETREATED SOMEWHAT NORTHWARD DURING THE PAST FEW 
DAYS...HOWEVER...IT HAS ALREADY DEPOSITED A SMALLER SCALE UPPER 
CYCLONIC GYRE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THIS GYRE 
CONTINUES TO MOVE SOUTH SOUTHEAST TOWARDS NORTHWESTERN CUBAN COAST. 
A DEVELOPING MID AND UPPER RIDGE EXTENDS FROM SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES 
NORTH OF PUERTO RICO WEST NORTHWESTWARD TO NORTH FLORIDA. ON THE 
SOUTH SIDE OF THIS FEATURE IS ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH THAT IS NOW 
BECOMING SHEARED ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN BAHAMAS.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...A DECAYING STATIONARY FRONT IS ANALYZED 
FROM OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST SOUTHWARD TO THE CAROLINAS...WITH A 
SURFACE TROUGH SOUTHWEST OVER FLORIDA. A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM 35 N 60 W WEST SOUTHWESTWARD TO ACROSS 
NORTH FLORIDA. SOUTH OF THAT...DEEP EASTERLY FLOW IS ESTABLISHED 
OVER THE BAHAMAS AND FLORIDA KEYS. THE BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW FROM THE 
MORNING 12Z SOUNDING AT KEY WEST IS DEEP EASTERLY FROM THE SURFACE 
TO 20000 FEET.

&&

.CURRENTLY...AT 200 PM...ABUNDANT CIRRUS IS VISIBLE OVER THE LOWER 
AND MIDDLE KEYS...AND ADJOINING WATERS. A LONG LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE FIRING UP ALONG THE NORTH COAST OF CUBA...FROM HAVANA TO 
VARADERO. KEY WEST RADAR IS NOW DEPICTING ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER MUCH OF THE WATERS...EXCEPT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE VISIBLE OVER THE EASTERN STRAITS. 
TEMPERATURES SO FAR TODAY HAVE RISEN TO 89 IN KEY WEST AND 90 AT 
MARATHON. AT PRESENT...JUST A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
MOVING OVER THE UPPER KEYS...BUT EARLIER SHOWERS AND STORMS HAVE 
AFFECTED PORTIONS OF THE UPPER AND LOWER KEYS WITHIN TCU LINES THAT 
DEVELOPED IN THE MORNING HOURS. WINDS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF ARE 
MAINLY EAST AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE MAINLY EAST NEAR 10 
KNOTS...AND MAINLY EAST NEAR 10 MPH OVER THE ISLANDS.  

&&
.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500-200 MB)TONIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A COMPLEX UPPER PATTERN IS IN PLACE OVER THE 
REGION. GFS FAIRLY INITIALIZES TO A FAIR DEGREE THE SMALLER SCALE 
CYCLONIC GYRE WILL CONTINUE ITS MIGRATION TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST 
THIS EVENING. MODELS CONTINUE WITH ABOVE NORMAL DIVERGENCE FIELDS 
OVER THE KEYS TONIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY. ON TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON...ANOTHER CONVERGENT BOUNDARY NOW OVER THE WESTERN BAHAMAS 
SHOULD MIGRATE OVERHEAD...PROVIDING ADDITIONAL SYNOPTIC LIFT. 
CONSIDERABLE MID AND UPPER DRYING FOLLOWS OVER THE KEYS ABOVE 700 MB 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT...CONTINUING THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK. 

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...LARGE UPPER RIDGING OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RESULTS IN MID AND UPPER LEVEL HEIGHT RISES AS THE MID AND 
UPPER ATMOSPHERE WARMS UP AND DRIES OUT...WITH 500 MB HEIGHTS NEAR 
595 DM BY FRIDAY ACROSS THE CAROLINAS WESTWARD TO THE NORTHERN GULF 
COAST. 

FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...MID AND UPPER LEVELS REMAIN FAIRLY DRY...BUT 
AN UPPER TROUGH APPROACHING LATE IN THE WEEKEND(ON SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY) WILL ENHANCE A SURFACE TROUGH/WEAK WAVE MOVING WEST 
NORTHWEST ACROSS THE KEYS FROM THE CARIBBEAN.
 
IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...(SURFACE TO 500 MB) WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL GRADUALLY BUILD. 12Z GFS FORECAST SOUNDING FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS 
CONTINUE TO INDICATE A MODERATE BUT DEEP EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW 
CONTINUING FROM THE SURFACE TO 15 KFT FOR TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THE LOW LEVEL TROUGH/WEAK WAVE THAT IS PRESENTLY ANALYZED 
JUST NORTH OF PUERTO RICO WILL PASS WEST OF KEYS LONGITUDE ON 
WEDNESDAY MORNING...SURFACE WINDS WILL INCREASE TO NEAR 15 KNOTS ON 
TUESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE WEAK WAVE/TROUGH.

TONIGHT...WITH 250 MB DIVERGENCE MENTIONED ABOVE...BOUNDARIES WILL 
LIKELY MOVE INTO THE FLORIDA STRAITS FROM CUBAN CONVECTION NOW 
FIRING OVER THE STRAITS. THE MID AND UPPER FLOW ON THE EAST SIDE OF 
THE GYRE TO OUR IMMEDIATE WEST WILL LIKELY PUSH BOUNDARIES TOWARDS 
THE KEYS. THESE BOUNDARIES WILL COLLIDE WITH CUMULUS/TCU LINES THAT 
ARE PRESENTLY NEAR THE KEYS. HAVE ELECTED TO BOOST POPS TO 50 
PERCENT.

TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...A WEAK LOW LEVEL TROUGH...NOW OVER THE 
BAHAMAS AND NOT DEFINED IN THE MODELS BUT EVIDENCED BY THE LINE OF 
CONVECTION OVER THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS DOWN TO ANDROS ISLAND...SHOULD 
MOVE ACROSS THE KEYS. HAVE MAINTAINED RAIN CHANCES AT 40 PERCENT. 
SURFACE WINDS WILL VEER TO SOUTHEAST BEHIND THIS FEATURE. WINDS WILL 
INCREASE AS THE MID ATLANTIC RIDGE BUILDS TO 1025 MB.

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A BETTER DEFINED LOW LEVEL 
TROUGH/WEAK WAVE...NOW NORTH OF HISPANIOLA...WILL MIGRATE TO ACROSS 
THE KEYS. THIS SHOULD ACT TO MAINTAIN ABOVE NORMAL RAIN CHANCES. 
SURFACE WINDS BEHIND THIS FEATURE WILL REMAIN SOUTHEAST BUT REMAIN 
AT A MODERATE MAGNITUDE.  

THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL 
REMAIN FIRMLY IN PLACE ACROSS FLORIDA AND THE ATLANTIC WATERS. THIS 
WILL ALLOW FOR CONTINUED MODERATE TRADE(MAINLY EAST) BREEZES ACROSS 
THE WATERS. WITH NO SIGNIFICANT PERTURBATIONS OR TROUGHS MOVING BY 
AT THIS TIME...WILL MAINTAIN ONGOING LOW CHANCE (30%) POPS THAT 
FOLLOW THE EXPECTED DIURNAL TREND.

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...MODELS CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN RIDGING BUT 
CONTINUE SHOW MULTIPLE UNDULATIONS MOVING THROUGH THE FLOW THROUGH 
THIS TIME. A WAVE NOW LOCATED EAST OF THE LOWER WEST INDIES...IS 
PROGGED TO REACH KEYS LONGITUDE BY LATE IN THE WEEKEND. HAVE 
INHERITED ENHANCED RAIN CHANCES NEAR 40% FOR THESE PERIODS...AND DO 
NOT SEE STRONG ENOUGH REASON TO ALTER THIS PERIOD. 
&&

.MARINE...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR ON THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS THIS EVENING...BECOMING ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT. WINDS AND SEAS MAY BE HIGHER IN SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. GENTLE BREEZES WILL BECOME MODERATE BREEZES BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT...IN RESPONSE TO A STRENGTHENING PRESSURE GRADIENT. DO 
NOT SEE ANY ADVISORIES...BUT WILL HAVE INCREASING WINDS AND SEAS BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT.

&&

.AVIATION...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THE MAINLAND SHOULD REMAIN 
ISOLD-WDLY SCT WITHIN THE CORRIDOR OF THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY WEST. 
CELL MOTION WILL BE SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST...WITH MOST TOPS AOB 
FL400.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1010 AM EDT MON JUL 10 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB) LATEST 
SATELLITE IMAGERY AND OBSERVATIONS INDICATES A TROUGH OVER THE 
MID-ATLANTIC AND NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. THE BASE OF THIS 
FEATURE HAS RETREATED SOMEWHAT NORTHWARD DURING THE PAST FEW 
DAYS...HOWEVER...IT HAS ALREADY DEPOSITED A SMALLER SCALE UPPER 
CYCLONIC GYRE IN THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. THIS GYRE IS JUST 
TO THE WEST SOUTHWEST OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. A DEVELOPING MID AND 
UPPER RIDGE EXTENDS FROM SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES NORTH OF PUERTO RICO 
WEST NORTHWESTWARD TO NORTH FLORIDA. ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THIS 
FEATURE IS ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH THAT IS NOW BECOMING SHEARED ACROSS 
THE SOUTHEASTERN BAHAMAS...WITH A WEAKER TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN 
BAHAMAS.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...A DECAYING STATIONARY FRONT IS ANALYZED 
FROM OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST SOUTHWARD TO THE CAROLINAS...WITH A 
SURFACE TROUGH SOUTHWEST OVER FLORIDA. A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM 35 N 60 W WEST SOUTHWESTWARD TO ACROSS 
NORTH FLORIDA. SOUTH OF THAT...DEEP EASTERLY FLOW IS ESTABLISHED 
OVER THE BAHAMAS AND FLORIDA KEYS. THE BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW FROM THE 
MORNING 12Z SOUNDING AT KEY WEST IS DEEP EASTERLY FROM THE SURFACE 
TO 20000 FEET.

&&

.CURRENTLY...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN 
AND ADJOINING WATERS. SATELLITE IMAGERY DEPICTS SOME CIRRUS OVER THE 
WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER 
VORTICITY CENTER/SMALLER SCALE CYCLONIC GYRE MEANDERING IN THE 
SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. SATELLITE IMAGERY ILLUSTRATES LOTS OF 
CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS AND KEYS ISLAND CHAIN. KEY 
WEST RADAR IS INDICATING SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS...WITH JUST A FEW THUNDERSTORMS INTERSPERSED WITHIN 
THROUGHOUT. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEEN 
MOVING OVER THE UPPER KEYS...BUT MOST ARE SOUTH OF THE FLORIDA REEF. 
A DECENT CLOUDLINE IS DEVELOPING OVER THE LOWER KEYS IN THE LIGHT 
EAST TO EAST NORTHEAST FLOW.  TEMPERATURES ARE PRESENTLY IN THE 
MIDDLE 80S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S. THE MORNING SOUNDING IS 
UNSTABLE THROUGH FROM THE SURFACE TO 25000 FEET...WITH ALMOST NO 
CIN(CONVECTIVE INHIBITION). C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF 
AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE REGISTERING 10 METER WINDS FROM 
NORTHEAST TO EAST BETWEEN 5 AND 9 KNOTS...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SAND 
KEY WHICH IS SOUTHEAST AT 5 KNOTS.  


&&
.FORECASTS...TODAY...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB)...THE 
MAIN CONCERN IS THE SMALLER SCALE GYRE THAT IS MIGRATING EASTWARD 
OVER THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. THE 06Z RUN SHOWS DECENT 200 MB 
DIVERGENCE IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS FEATURE BY THE END OF THE DAY AS 
IT IS PROGGED TO MOVE OVER WESTERN CUBA. THIS COULD ENHANCE 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT OVER WESTERN CUBA...POSSIBLY IMPACTING THE 
WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS LATER TODAY. INTERESTINGLY...THOUGH 
HOWEVER...AT THE PRESENT TIME...MOST OF THE ACTIVITY IS PRESENTLY 
CONCENTRATED IN THE EASTERN FLORIDA STRAITS. THIS COULD BE AN 
EXTENSION OF THE WEAK TROUGH TO OUR IMMEDIATE EAST.  

IN THE LOWER AND MID-LEVELS...SURFACE WINDS SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT AND 
EASTERLY...BUT MAY BACK TO NORTHEAST AT TIMES. ACTIVITY WITHIN THE 
EASTERLY FLOW SHOULD REMAIN SCATTERED. THE LATEST (06Z) 12 HOUR GFS 
#S THROUGH 00Z TODAY ARE 46 AND 49 PERCENT.WITH THE CURRENT RADAR 
TRENDS...AND CLOUD LINE FORMATION...WILL HOLD WITH INHERITED 40 
PERCENT...BUT THIS IS PRELIMINARY. TEMPERATURES ARE ON TRACK TO 
REACH AROUND 90. IF SYNOPTIC ENHANCEMENT DUE TO UPPER DIFFLUENCE 
WERE MORE CERTAIN OVER THE KEYS...WOULD BE MORE INCLINED TO RAISE 
POPS A BIT. WILL WAIT ANOTHER HOUR OR SO TO SEE RADAR TRENDS.

&&

.MARINE...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED 
ON ALL WATERS...BUT THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE MAY BECOME SCATTERED IF 
UPPER GYRE TO WEST AND TROUGH TO THE EAST PROVIDE ADDITIONAL 
DIFFLUENCE ALLOWING FOR ENHANCEMENT OF COVERAGE. MAINLY EAST WINDS 
NEAR 10 KNOTS ARE EXPECTED OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

&&

AVIATION...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ON THE 
MAINLAND...AFTER ABOUT 16Z (NOON EDT). COVERAGE SHOULD REMAIN 
ISOLD-WDLY SCT WITHIN THE CORRIDOR OF THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY WEST. 
CELL MOTION WILL BE SLOW AND ERRATIC...WITH MOST TOPS AOB FL400. 

A CLOUD LINE IS LIKELY TODAY IN THE LOWER KEYS. ISOLD SHRA WITHIN 
THIS FEATURE MAY BRING BRIEF MVFR CIGS AND VSBYS TO THE KEY WEST 
TERMINAL. THIS IS NOT INDICATED EXPLICITLY IN OUR TAFS. IF THUNDER 
OCCURS WE WILL ISSUE A TIMELY AMENDMENT.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENTLY...
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS STRETCHING INTO A SHEAR AXIS ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PENINSULA OF FLORIDA...WITH A VORTMAX IN THE EAST CENTRAL 
GULF...AND ANOTHER CYCLONIC SHEAR AXIS EXTENDING WEST INTO THE WEST 
CENTRAL GULF. A SPEED MAXIMUM AROUND 45 KT AT 200 MB IS SHOOTING 
EASTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN GULF AND WITH CIRRUS ENHANCEMENT ACROSS 
THE YUCATAN CHANNEL. AT THE SURFACE...A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDS 
ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA. SKIES ARE MOSTLY TO PARTLY CLEAR ACROSS THE 
KEYS WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS DRIFTING WESTWARD ACROSS THE 
STRAITS...NEARLY ALL OF IT UNORGANIZED. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 80F 
WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW 70S...AND LIGHT EAST WINDS 6 TO 11 KNOTS 
MEASURED BY CMAN STATIONS ALONG THE REEF. 

FORECAST...
THE CHALLENGE FOR TODAY WILL BE WHETHER DRY MID-LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE WILL BE OFFSET BY A NEAR-MISS FROM A JET STREAK ROTATING 
AROUND A DEVELOPING UPPER VORTEX IN THE GULF. GFS PROGS THE 
STREAK...POSSIBLY STRENGTHENING TO NEAR 50 KT AT 250 MB...TURNING 
AROUND THE SOUTHEAST PERIPHERY OF THE DEVELOPING UPPER LOW ACROSS 
WESTERN CUBA. STEERING FLOW IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN OUT OF THE EAST 
SOUTHEAST TODAY...BUT SOME ENHANCED CONVECTION MAY STRAY INTO THE 
STRAITS SOUTHWEST OF THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. GFS MOS POPS FOR KEYW 
HAVE HELD FAST NEAR 40 PERCENT AND CANNOT FIND AN ARGUMENT TO ALTER 
CURRENT RUNNING CHANCE POPS FOR TODAY. 

BY LATE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...THE NEW UPPER LOW IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN 
DRIFTING WEST SOUTHWEST PULLING THE FAVORABLE UPPER DIVERGENCE AND 
RESULTANT LIFT WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. A MINOR PERTURBATION IN 
THE EASTERLIES...SEEN WEAKLY IN THE GFS 850 MB FIELDS AND SOMEWHAT 
TOO STRONG IN THE NAM...IS EXPECTED TO TRACK THROUGH THE AREA 
TUESDAY TURNING DEEP STEERING FLOW BELOW 700 MB TO SOUTHEAST. IT IS 
ALSO NOTED THERE APPEARS TO BE A LOW LEVEL TROUGH REFLECTION 
DEVELOPING UNDER THE SOUTHEAST QUADRANT OF THE NEWLY DEVELOPED UPPER 
LOW AS WELL. ANY ENHANCEMENT OF THIS FEATURE MAY VEER THE LOW LEVEL 
FLOW A BIT SOONER. THE GFS SHOWS AGGRESSIVE DEEP LIFT 0600Z TUESDAY 
WITH LITTLE RESPONSE IN THE MOS POPS...AND WILL HAVE TO WATCH 
ADDITIONAL PROGS TODAY CAREFULLY.

BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...GFS IS INSISTING ON NUMEROUS POCKETS OF DRY 
AIR ABOVE 850 MB...POSSIBLY BRINGING PRECIPITABLE WATERS TO NEAR 1.6 
INCHES OR SO. TEMPERED POPS BACK TO CLIMO LEVELS FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY WHICH IS NOW ABOVE MOS VALUES. RETURNED TO ELEVATED CHANCE 
POPS FOR THE UPCOMING WEEKEND DUE TO ANOTHER PERTURBATION WHICH 
COULD BE STRONGER THAN THE ONE EXPECTED TUESDAY...BUT TOO EARLY TO 
TELL. GENERALLY THE WEEK WILL FEATURE A FEW SHOWERS FROM TIME TO 
TIME WITH A NICE LIGHT TO MODERATE EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZE.

&&

.MARINE...
WINDS WILL START OUT OUT OF THE EAST NEAR 10 KNOTS THIS MORNING AND 
GRADUALLY PICK UP TO NEAR 15 KNOTS BY LATE TUESDAY. AT THIS TIME NO 
FLAGS ARE NEEDED WITH WIND DIRECTION VEERING TO SOUTHEAST BY TUESDAY 
NIGHT IN THE WAKE OF THE FIRST DISTRUBANCE/LOW LEVEL TROUGH. WINDS 
BACK TO EAST AS HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD MID-WEEK IN THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC TO SOUTHEAST STATES. SEAS COULD EXCEED 5 FEET AT 
TIMES IN THE GULF STREAM BY THURSDAY WHEN WINDS ARE OUT OF THE EAST.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
PRODUCE LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE...WITH BRIEF IFR 
VISIBILITIES IN STRONGER CELLS. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL 
BE MAINLY EAST AT 10 KT OR LESS.

UNSTABLE AIR MASS...WITH A MLCAPE OF 1411 J/KG AND AN 850-500MB 
LAPSE RATE OF 5.6 C/KM. WINDS WERE WEAK THROUGHOUT THE 
TROPOSPHERE...AVERAGING 10KT IN THE 1000-200MB LAYER. SHEAR WAS ALSO 
WEAK...WITH A 0-6KM BULK SHEAR MAGNITUDE OF 10KT. THESE PARAMETERS 
SUGGEST A UNICELLULAR CONVECTIVE MODE...WHICH IS VERIFIED BY RECENT 
DOPPLER RADAR SCANS. WEAK CONVECTIVE INHIBITION WAS INDICATED BY THE

ATLANTIC AND GULF WATERS. ELSEWHERE...A LARGE AND VERY DISCERNIBLE 
UPPER LEVEL CYCLONIC CIRUCATION IS CHURNING WESTWARD...WITH 
CONSIDERABLE DEEP AND WET CONVECTION ON ITS EASTERN SEMICIRCLE. 
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE NOSING 
ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA...WITH AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED STATIONARY 
TROUGH ALIGNED ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA. MEANWHILE...ACROSS THE MARINE 
DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS INDICATE MOSTLY EAST

EXTENDS FROM THE INVERSION TO 600 MB...WITH LOW LEVEL EASTERLIES 
OVERLAID BY WESTERLIES ABOVE 800 MB.

FOR TODAY...WITH A LACK OF INSOLATION AND PLENTY OF DRY AIR IN THE

400 AM EDT SAT JUL 8 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SINCE 10 PM...SECONDARY CONVECTION FORMED ON SEVERAL OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES THE ORIGINATED NORTH AND NORTHWEST OF THE KEYS AND MOVED 
SOUTH OVER THE LOWER KEYS AND WATERS. SUBSEQUENTLY...MANY OTHER
BOUNDARIES FORMED AND FIRED THIRD AND FOURTH ROUND SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WHICH HAD ERRATIC CELL MOVEMENT...BUT THE AREA AS A 
WHOLE HAS SLOWLY SHIFTED EAST INTO THE MID AND UPPER KEYS...FLORIDA 
BAY...AND ATLANTIC WATERS SOUTH OF THE MID AND UPPER KEYS. KEY WEST 
DOPPLER RADAR RAINFALL ESTIMATES SHOWED 2-4 INCHES OF RAIN WITHIN AN 
HOUR AROUND LONG KEY. LOWER KEYS AND WESTERN KEYS WATER AREAS HAVE 
FOR THE TIME STABILIZED...AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARY WINDS GENERALLY FROM 
THE NE ARE STILL BLOWING OVER THESE AREAS. BESIDES THE IGNITION OF 
SHOWERS AND STORMS BY INTERSECTION OF BOUNDARIES...THE MID LEVEL 
(500 MB) TROUGH THAT MOVED SSE OVER FLORIDA AND TO THE KEYS 
YESTERDAY AND LAST EVENING APPEARS TO BE NEAR THE KEYS...AND THAT 
MAY ACCOUNT BOTH FOR THE SLOW EAST SHIFT OF OVERALL CONVECTION OVER 
THE KEYS...AS WELL AS THE FORMATION OF SIGNIFICANT THUNDERSTORM 
CLUSTERS OVER THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS THE PAST FEW HOURS. OF NOTE IS 
THAT WHILE KEYS AREA CONVECTION IS CREEPING EAST...SEPARATE SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE OUTER STRAITS BEYOND 20 NM OFF THE UPPER 
AND MIDDLE KEYS ARE MOVING WEST INTO KEYS WATERS. 
&&

.MARINE...
MODELS ON THE WHOLE, BUT ESPECIALLY THE NAM MODEL, HAVE SHIFTED INTO 
A MORE MOISTENED MODE IN THE NEAR FUTURE. THE GFS WAS ALREADY 
INDICATING THAT DRY AIR ALOFT WOULD LARGELY MODIFY TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BUT IT TOO IS A BIT WETTER THAN BEFORE AND THUS MOS POPS 
ARE UP A BIT. 

TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THE OVERALL PATTERN OVER THE KEYS SEEMS TO 
CONSIST OF WEAK LOW AND MID LEVEL WIND PATTERNS. A WEAKENING 500 MB 
TROUGH SHOULD STALL OVERHEAD OR NEARBY TODAY...THEN GRADUALLY MOVE 
BACK WEST MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE NAM FORMS AN ASSOCIATED LOWER 
LEVEL REFLECTION OF THE 500 MB TROUGH...AND MOVES A WEAK SURFACE TO 
850 MB TROUGH WEST OVER THE KEYS MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT WITH 
FOLLOWING MOISTURE TUESDAY...WHILE THE GFS HAS BARELY A HINT OF A 
TROUGH AT LOWER LEVELS. AT THIS POINT I WILL NOT YET UPGRADE ANY 
POPS FOR PERIODS BEYOND TODAY...BUT SOME BOOST MAY BE NEEDED FOR 
TONIGHT AND MONDAY IF THAT MID LEVEL TROUGH CONTINUES TO ACTIVATE 
SHOWERS AS IT BEGINS TO RETROGRADE WEST OVER THE KEYS.  HOWEVER... 
SINCE THE GFS MOS HAS 50 PCT POPS FOR TODAY THAT PERIOD WILL 
ACCORDINGLY BE BOOSTED TO AN AGREEABLE 50 PCT. AT HIGH LEVELS
(200-300 MB) A SHARP UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH IS CURRENTLY SLICING 
ACROSS GEORGIA AND OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. AS THIS FEATURE 
SWINGS SE TODAY TO LIE OVER NORTH FLORIDA AND THE NE GULF...HIGH 
LEVEL WINDS OVER THE KEYS ARE FORECAST BY THE GFS TO INCREASE AND 
SOME SEMBLANCE OF A HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENT PATTERN SETS IN OVERHEAD OR 
NEARBY...ABOVE THE MID LEVEL TROUGH. BASED ON THIS...I DONT HAVE 
THE CONFIDENCE TO UNDER-CUT GFS MOS POPS. MEANWHILE AT THE SURFACE...
THE WESTERN EDGE OF AN ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL JUST POKE 
INTO THE NE BAHAMAS TODAY AND TONIGHT...THEN START TO EXPAND WEST A 
BIT MONDAY...KEEPING A LIGHT (10 MPH) GRADIENT FLOW OVER THE KEYS 
BEFORE THE EXPANDING RIDGE STARTS TO BOOST EAST WINDS A BIT COME 
TUESDAY. 

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...ON THE WHOLE...LOWER LEVEL FLOW 
SHOULD BE EAST OR EAST-SOUTHEAST AS LARGE HIGH PRESSURE EXPANDS OVER 
THE NW ATLANTIC. EXTENDED GFS SHOWS A FEW MINOR PASSING TROUGHS OR 
WEAK TROPICAL WAVES THAT COULD BOOST WINDS AND/OR SHOWERS LOCALLY...
MAYBE WEDNESDAY AND AGAIN LATE IN THE WEEK. AT MID TO HIGH LEVELS...
AN ANTICYCLONE IS SHOWN TO BUILD EAST OVER THE GULF TO FLORIDA. 
30 PCT POPS ARE OKAY FOR NOW. 
&&


.MARINE...
THE WESTERN EDGE OF ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE STILL POKES INTO THE 
NORTHERN BAHAMAS...AND THIS OUGHT TO KEEP KEYS WINDS COMING MAINLY 
FROM THE EAST...NEAR 10 KT EXCEPT 10-15 KT TO THE SOUTH OF THE 
ISLANDS OUT IN THE STRAITS...ON THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. AN UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH THREATENS TO BRING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS BACK WEST OVER THE KEYS...MAYBE TODAY, TONIGHT, AND 
MONDAY AS WELL...AND THESE WILL PRODUCE ERRATIC WIND DIRECTIONS AND 
GUSTS. THE ATLANTIC RIDGE IS STILL EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY EXPAND OVER 
THE NW ATLANTIC TOWARD GEORGIA AND THE CAROLINAS TUESDAY ONWARD...
AND THIS MAY INCREASE KEYS WINDS INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE...RIGHT 
AROUND 15 KT IN THE STRAITS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
PRODUCE LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS ALONG THE ROUTE...WITH BRIEF IFR 
VISIBILITIES IN STRONGER CELLS. THESE SHOULD BE 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE...BUT WILL INCREASE IN COVERAGE AND INTENSITY OVER 
THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE THIS AFTERNOON. SURFACE WINDS AT 
KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE MAINLY EAST AT 10 KT OR LESS.

251 PM EDT FRI JUL 7 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
ABUNDANT MID- AND HIGH-LEVEL CLOUDINESS HAS PERSISTED ACROSS MOST OF 
THE ISLAND CHAIN THIS AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
COVERAGE HAS BEEN ON THE WANE. THE KEY WEST DOPPLER WIND PROFILE 
SHOWS SOUTH-SOUTHEAST FLOW 0-3000FT AGL AND SOUTH-SOUTHWEST FLOW 
4000-20000FT AGL. GOES-12 VISIBLE CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS REVEAL A 
DISTURBED CONVECTIVE REGIME ACROSS MUCH OF THE EASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...FLORIDA PENINSULA...AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC WATERS. GOES-12 
MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS SHOW A SHARP MIDLATITUDE TROUGH DIGGING 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES...SUPPORTING THE 
DISTURBED CONVECTIVE REGIME OVER FLORIDA. MEANWHILE...A STRONG 
MID-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE COVERS A CONVECTIVELY SUPPRESSED REGION OVER 
MUCH OF THE BAHAMAS...STRAITS OF FLORIDA...CUBA...AND ADJACENT 
CARIBBEAN WATERS. 

FORECAST:
THE EXPECTATION HAS BEEN FOR THE RIDGE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF THE 
KEYS TO MOVE QUICKLY NORTH OVER THE KEYS AND FLORIDA PENINSULA...BUT 
THIS SCENARIO HAS BEEN DELAYED DUE TO THE WELL-DEFINED MIDLATITUDE 
TROUGH DIGGING ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST. THE RIDGE WILL STILL LIKELY 
MOVE NORTH TO NEAR THE KEYS THEN JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS TONIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...THE TRANSLATION WILL BE SLOWER 
THAN PREVIOUSLY ANTICIPATED DUE TO LINGERING MIDLATITUDE VORTICITY 
IN THE SUBTROPICS NORTH OF THE KEYS. BY MONDAY...THE MEAN LOW-LEVEL 
RIDGE WILL PROBABLY BECOME ESTABLISHED WELL NORTH OF THE KEYS... 
PLACING THE AREA BENEATH DEEP EASTERLIES THROUGH THE END OF THE 
WEEK. 

THE UPSHOT IS THAT THE FORECAST CONTAINS A HIGHER DEGREE OF 
UNCERTAINTY...ESPECIALLY FOR SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
THEREFORE...WE WILL ADHERE TO CLIMATOLOGY RATHER CLOSELY FOR MOST OF 
THIS TIME FRAME.
&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE TO MODERATE SOUTHEAST BREEZES TONIGHT WILL TURN EAST BY 
SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY. THERE IS STILL A DECENT LIKELIHOOD THAT 
EAST BREEZES WILL FRESHEN EARLY NEXT WEEK AS AN ATLANTIC RIDGE 
FINALLY BUILDS NORTH OF THE KEYS.
&&

.AVIATION...
THUNDERSTORMS ON THE MAINLAND WILL DECREASE THIS AFTERNOON. BY 
20Z...400PM EDT...COVERAGE SHOULD BE ISOLATED AND THE STORMS 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. MEAN STORM MOTION WILL BE APPROX 22015KT WITH MOST 
TOPS AOB FL350. ELSEWHERE ON THE ROUTE ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE 
LIKELY. VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS.

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING REVEALED FURTHER GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT 
RISES DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS...AND THE MSL PRESSURES ACROSS THE 
KEYS HAVE RISEN ABOUT ANOTHER MILLIBAR. THE UPPER CYCLONE THAT WAS 
AROUND FOR THE LAST FEW DAYS HAS BEEN ASSUMED BY THE FLOW AHEAD OF A 
DIGGING MIDLATITUDE SHORT WAVE TROUGH...AND A STRONG SFC-400MB RIDGE 
HAS BUILT SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE BAHAMAS AND CUBA...PLACING THE 
KEYS IN DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW. A MUCH DRIER AIR MASS WAS OVER MUCH OF 
THE BAHAMAS...EASTERN CUBA...AND HISPANIOLA...MOVING NORTHWEST 
TOWARD THE KEYS. HOWEVER...THE KEY WEST 12Z SOUNDING REVEALED VERY 
MOIST CONDITIONS IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...AND RECENT GPS-MET DATA 
FROM GEIGER KEY INDICATE TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES STILL IN 
EXCESS OF 2 INCHES. CURRENT DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW A LARGE 
MULTICELL CONVECTIVE CLUSTER BETWEEN THE MARQUESAS KEYS AND DRY 
TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK...EXTENDING BOTH NORTH AND SOUTH FOR SOME 40 
NAUTICAL MILES...WITH THE WHOLE COMPLEX MOVING NORTH. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE OCCURRING ELSEWHERE...AFFECTING 
PORTIONS OF THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS.

CURRENT FORECASTS ARE ON TRACK. DRIER AIR SHOULD GRADUALLY WORK INTO 
THE SERVICE AREA FROM THE SOUTHEAST DURING THE DAY...AND SHOWER AND 
STORM COVERAGE SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED ACROSS THE KEYS AND STRAITS... 
SCATTERED OVER GULF AND FLORIDA BAY WATERS. 
&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE SOUTHEAST BREEZES WILL PERSIST FOR THE REST OF TODAY...WITH 
LOCALLY HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS IN AND NEAR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG EYW-MIA AIRWAYS AND AT EYW AND MTH 
THROUGH 24Z. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE LOCAL 
MVFR CONDITIONS...AND A FEW BRIEF IFR VISIBILITIES IN STRONGER 
CELLS...ESPECIALLY AFTER 16Z. HOWEVER...THESE CONDITIONS SHOULD BE 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. SURFACE WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE FROM 120-160 AT 
4-8KT.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
345 AM EDT FRI JUL 7 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AS OF 2 AM (06Z) A WEAK AND BROAD SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IS 
ROUGHLY ANALYZED EXTENDING WEST OVER THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS AND OVER 
THE FLORIDA KEYS. LOWER KEYS AND DRY TORTUGAS WINDS HAVE TURNED TO 
SOUTH 5 TO 10 KT IN RESPONSE TO THE RIDGE...BUT MIDDLE AND UPPER 
KEYS WINDS ARE STILL LIGHT AND VARIABLE WITHIN A MODIFIED AND 
STABILIZED LOCAL AIRMASS LEFT BEHIND BY STRONG CONVECTION THAT MOVED 
NORTH OVER THE AREA BEFORE MIDNIGHT UP UNTIL 130-200 AM. MOST OF THE 
EARLIER CONVECTION OVER THE KEYS AREA HAS MOVED NORTH OF THE AREA OR 
DWINDLED...HOWEVER A FEW NEWLY DEVELOPED SHOWERS WITH TOPS HIGH 
ENOUGH FOR LIGHTNING (34 KFT) ARE MOVING SLOWLY NORTH INTO WATERS 
BETWEEN KEY WEST AND THE MARQUESAS KEYS. OVERCAST TO BROKEN MID AND 
HIGH CLOUDS COVER THE KEYS AT THIS TIME...MAKING IT HARD TO FIGURE 
HOW FAR WEST THE DRY AIR ALOFT HAS PROGRESSED...BUT THE BEST GUESS 
BASED ON WATER VAPOR AND GOES SOUNDER IMAGES IS THAT THE LEADING 
(WEST) EDGE OF DRIER AIR IS NOW MOVING OVER ANDROS ISLAND. CERTAINLY 
EASTERN CUBA, THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN BAHAMAS ARE UNDER THE DRIER 
AIR ALOFT. A COOLER-THAN-NORMAL AIRMASS FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR HAS 
COME WELL SOUTH OVER THE EASTERN STATES...AND THE COOL FRONT ALONG 
THE LEADING EDGE OF THIS AIRMASS IS MOVING SOUTH THROUGH GEORGIA 
NOW. 


.FORECAST...
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE MADE TO THE UPCOMING FORECAST PACKAGE. 
ALL THE VARIOUS MODELS INDICATE THAT A LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL FORM 
ON THE FRONT OFF THE NE FLORIDA-GEORGIA COAST TODAY...BUT THERE ARE 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MODELS WITH THE NAM MODEL QUESTIONABLE. MODELS 
ALSO GENERALLY AGREE THAT THE DRY AIR ALOFT WILL WORK ITS WAY WEST 
OVER THE KEYS AT LEAST BY TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. THERE IS SOME  
QUESTION ABOUT ARRIVAL TIMING OF THE DRY AIR FOR TODAY...BUT AT 
LEAST THE NAM AND GFS INDICATE THE BEGINNING OF LOWER RELATIVE 
HUMIDITY AT AT LEVELS FROM 3-6 THSD FT AGL DURING THIS AFTERNOON. 

TODAY...NAM AND GFS SHOW RH VALUES DROPPING AROUND THE 850 MB LEVEL 
(APPROX. 3-6 THSD FT) AFTER 18Z TODAY. MODEL MOS POPS ARE NEAR 30 
PCT...BUT ILL RETAIN THE CURRENT 20 PCT FOR TODAY. WILL WATCH FOR 
MAINLY MORNING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER ATLANTIC WATERS AND 
KEYS ISLANDS. HOPEFULLY WITH SE LOWER LEVEL WINDS AND DRIER AIR 
ALOFT SHOWERS WILL BE LESS LIKELY THIS AFTERNOON FOR ATLANTIC WATERS 
AND OVER ISLANDS. MARINE ZONES OF FLORIDA BAY AND KEYS GULF WATERS 
HOWEVER SHOULD SEE CLOUD LINES MOVING NW OFF ISLANDS...INTO THE 
STILL DEEPER MOISTURE...SO I WILL RETAIN A BIT HIGHER POPS FOR THOSE 
WATERS THIS AFTERNOON. THE RIDGE POKING INTO THE KEYS SHOULD BECOME 
A LITTLE BETTER DEFINED AND SHIFT TO THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA...
ALLOWING KEYS WINDS TO GO FROM S TO SE AND MAYBE PICK UP NEAR 10 
MPH. SOME OF THE HAZE (AFRICAN DUST) ALOFT MAY COME IN TODAY...HARD
TO SAY. 

TONIGHT-SATURDAY...DRY AIR OVERHEAD IS EXPECTED TO BECOME DEEPER...
AFFECTING THE IN THE 2-10 THSD FT ABOVE GROUND LEVELS. HAZE/DUST MAY 
BE APPARENT ALOFT AND INTO LOWER LEVELS TOO. I WILL DISCOUNT THE NAM 
MODELS APPARENT OVER-DEVELOPMENT OF THE LOW OFF NE FLORIDA...AND 
STAY CLOSE TO THE GFS MODEL WHICH KEEPS THE KEY UNDER INFLUENCE OF 
THE WEAK SURFACE RIDGE WHICH IT SHOWS SHIFTING OVER THE SOUTH 
FLORIDA PENINSULA...AND THEREBY PUTTING THE KEYS UNDER A LIGHT TO 
MODERATE EAST FLOW. LOW POPS ARE IN ORDER...20 PCT AT MOST. 

SATURDAY NIGHT-TUESDAY...THE UNUSUAL SUMMERTIME FRONT SHOULD SINK 
SOUTH INTO NORTH FLORIDA AND STALL AS THE LOW PRESSURE THE FORMS OFF 
NE FLORIDA/GEORGIA MOVES AWAY TO THE NE. THIS WILL KEEP THE WEAK 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA UNTIL AROUND SUNDAY NIGHT WHEN THE 
FRONT DISSIPATES OR MOVES NORTH OUT OF FLORIDA...AND THE RIDGE 
SHIFTS NORTH AND STRENGTHENS. THESE CHANGES WOULD OF COURSE LEAD TO 
AN INCREASE IN EAST WINDS OVER THE KEYS...AND THAT IS FORECAST FOR 
THE PERIOD FROM LATE THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. LATEST GFS 
IS A BIT SLOWER TO INCREASE LOCAL WINDS...BUT SUNDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT 
OUGHT TO SEE SOME MODERATE EAST BREEZES. THE VERY DRY AIR ALOFT IS 
EXPECTED TO MODIFY TO MORE MOIST AIR UP TO 5 THSD FT AGL...BUT STILL 
BE A BIT DRY ABOVE THAT. 30 PCT POPS ARE OKAY. 

TUESDAY NIGHT-THURSDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS BRINGS A FAIRLY WELL 
DEFINED TROPICAL WAVE WEST OVER THE KEYS TUESDAY NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY.
FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER PUSH OF DRY AIR ALOFT COME NEXT THURSDAY. THIS 
IS A BIT FAR OUT IN TIME TO BE SPECIFIC YET. 
&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT SOUTH OR EVEN VARIABLE WINDS THIS MORNING SHOULD TURN MORE TO 
THE SE AND INCREASE CLOSER TO 10 KT FOR THE AFTERNOON...AS A WEAK 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE SHIFTS NORTH OVER THE KEYS TO THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
MAINLAND. THEREAFTER...THAT RIDGE SHOULD BE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF 
OF THE PENINSULA UNTIL AROUND SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY...GIVING EAST 
WINDS 10 KT...OR MORE LIKE 10-15 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS. THEREAFTER...
PERHAPS DURING SUNDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT...THE RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO 
STRENGTHEN AND SHIFT FARTHER NORTH...GIVING A BOOST TO KEYS AREA 
WINDS...WHICH MAY BLOW NEAR 15 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS...10-15 KT NEAR 
THE ISLANDS, BAY, AND GULF WATERS AT LEAST THROUGH TUESDAY. SEAS MAY 
BUILD INTO THE 3-5 FT RANGE WITH THE WIND BOOST. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
PRODUCE LOCAL MVFR CONDITIONS...AND A FEW BRIEF IFR VISIBILITIES IN 
STRONGER CELLS...ESPECIALLY BY LATE MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON. 
HOWEVER...THESE CONDITIONS SHOULD BE CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. SURFACE WINDS 
AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE GENERALLY SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH SOUTHEAST AT 6 
KT OR LESS IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS...THEN INCREASING A BIT TO 
5-10 KT BY LATE MORNING.

1020 PM EDT THU JUL 6 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS WERE VERY ACTIVE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW...AS WELL AS A MOIST AND UNSTABLE 
ATMOSPHERE...ALLOWED FOR CONVECTIVE BOUNDARIES TO RACE ACROSS THE 
STRAITS OF FLORIDA...AND CROSS OVER ALL MOST THE ENTIRE KEYS ISLAND 
CHAIN...INTO THE GULF AND BAY WATERS NORTH. NUMEROUS WIND GUSTS 
ABOVE 30 KNOTS WERE REPORTED WITH THESE BOUNDARIES AND STORMS AT 
REEF AND LAND LOCATIONS EARLIER THIS EVENING. MOST OF THE CONVECTIVE 
ACTIVITY REMAINS IN THE UPPER KEYS AND ADJACENT FLORIDA BAY AND 
ATLANTIC WATERS...HOWEVER THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE 
NORTH AND EAST OF THE AREA THROUGH MIDNIGHT. THE REST OF THE KEYS 
RANGE IN TEMPERATURES FROM THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S...WITH 
DEWPOINTS AROUND 70 DEGREES...UNDER MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

.FORECAST...
A DRIER AIRMASS WILL ENTER OVER THE KEYS SERVICE AREA OVERNIGHT...IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH HIGH PRESSURE AREA BUILDING IN OVER SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE REDUCED...AS WELL AS TRANSITIONAL 
TIMING FOR THE UPDATED OVERNIGHT FORECAST. 
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS WILL BECOME SOUTHEAST AROUND 10 KNOTS OVERNIGHT...AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THIS EVENING ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO 
KEY WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. SCATTERED HEAVY SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL IMPACT THE TWEB ROUTE THROUGH ABOUT 06Z. A LINE 
OF HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PRODUCING WIND GUSTS OVER 35 
KNOTS WILL MOVE NORTHEAST EAST OVER THE UPPER KEYS...FLORIDA 
BAY...AND OVER DADE COUNTY. PERIODIC MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS WILL BE 
ENCOUNTERED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS LINE. THIS WILL BE DUE TO 
MVFR/IFR VIS/CIGS LASTING LESS THAN 30 MINUTES...WITH ISOLATED BUT 
BRIEF LIFR CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE...LASTING LESS THAN 10 MINUTES.  
WEATHER WILL RAPIDLY IMPROVE AFTER ABOUT 08Z...WITH JUST ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND MID CLOUDS AOA 7000-9000 FEET.

THERE ARE CURRENTLY ACTIVE WEATHER ADVISORIES POSTED ALONG THE 
KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE...PLEASE REMEMBER TO CHECK ALL AVAILABLE 
AIRMETS/SIGMETS/METARS/TAFS WHEN PLANNING YOUR FLIGHT.

1015 PM EDT THU JUL 6 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO DIG INTO NORTH FLORIDA 
AND THE NORTHEAST GULF. GOOD DIVERGENCE OVERTOP A FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
IN CENTRAL FLORIDA CONTINUES TO SUPPORT WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND 
OCCASIONAL THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH PENINSULA. A 
SURFACE RIDGE AXIS HAD TRIED TO NOSE WEST TO SOUTHWEST NEAR OR JUST 
NORTH OF KEYS...BUT IS HARD TO DISCERN WITH VARIOUS PRESSURE 
PERTURBATIONS AND THE OCCASIONAL WEAK OUTFLOW BOUNDARY SINKING 
THROUGH THE GULF AND BAY WATERS. LATEST VWP INDICATES A MORE 
ESTABLISHED LIGHT 5 TO 10 KNOT EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW AT AROUND 
2000-3000 FEET. WINDS HAVE BEEN VARIABLE 8 KNOTS OR LESS...WITH SOME 
ATTEMPT TO ESTABLISH EAST WINDS ACROSS THE STRAITS. TEMPERATURES ARE 
HOLDING IN THE MID 80S...WITH OVERCAST SKIES. A WEAK OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARY HAS SLIPPED INTO THE GULF WATERS WEST OF MAINLAND 
MONROE...WITH ANOTHER BOUNDARY ALONG THE REEF OFF KEY LARGO. THESE 
HAVE FOCUSED THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
SPRINKLES HAVE DOTTED THE WESTERN WATERS BEYOND DRY TORTUGAS.

PLANNED UPDATE TO THE ZONE PACKAGE WILL BE TO INDICATE VERY 
PESSIMISTIC CLOUD COVER. WILL WATCH PRECIPITATION TRENDS OVER THE 
NEXT HOUR AS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS APPEAR FINE. GFS INDICATE THE THICK 
CIRRUS AND ALTOSTRATUS CANOPY IS NOT LIKELY TO BREAK DO TO A 
COMBINATION OF HIGH MOISTURE ABOVE 600 MB AND SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT 
OCCURING BELOW. EVEN NAM MOS INDICATES OVERCAST SKIES OVERNIGHT. 
DRYING HAS OCCURRED BELOW 600 MB...BUT INVERSION HAS APPEARED AS OF 
YET. 
&&

.MARINE...
MAY BOOST COVERAGE OF SHOWERS TO SCATTERED ACROSS THE GULF WATERS 
NORTH OF KEY WEST FOR THE OVERNIGHT DUE TO COOL OUTFLOW SINKING 
SOUTHWARD INTO WATERS WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY...AND WILL 
INDICATE LIGHT NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS AS THE AFOREMENTIONED WEAK 
SURFACE RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY TAKE HOLD TO OUR NORTH OVER THE NEXT 12 
HOURS.

CURRENTLY THE TWEB ROUTE IS CLEAR OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
HOWEVER...A BROKEN LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS JUST WEST OF 
THE ROUTE IS MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHEASTWARD AT AROUND 10 KNOTS. THIS 
ACTIVITY...SHOULD IT MAKE IT INTO THE ROUTE...WILL INCREASE COVERAGE 
TO WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE 
MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE. MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO 
DISSIPATE BEFORE REACHING ROUTES CENTER LINE. ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE ANTICIPATED OVER THE MARINE PORTION OF THE 
ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL START OUT 
NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT AROUND 5 KNOTS...BUT BY EARLY MORNING THEY 
SHOULD COME AROUND TO EAST SOUTHEASTERLY AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS. 
LASTLY...SAHARAN DUST MAY MOVE INTO THE ROUTE OVERNIGHT AND THE 
BUILDING SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW...RESULTING IN PERIODS WHERE VISIBILITY 
MAY DROP INTO THE HIGH MVFR RANGE.

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
THE FLORIDA KEYS NOW LIE ALONG THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A 
STRENGTHENING ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE. WINDS IN THE 0-4KM LAYER OVER 
THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA ARE ABOUT 190/18KT ACCORDING TO THE LATEST 
RUC ANALYSIS. RECENT DOPPLER RADAR SCANS DETECTED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS MOVING NORTH OFF THE COAST OF CUBA...WITH A POSSIBLE 
LOWER KEYS IMPACT JUST AFTER 21Z ACCORDING TO THE LATEST RADAR 
TRENDS. RADAR AND SATELLITE IMAGERY ALSO SHOW ADDITIONAL MULTICELL 
CONVECTIVE CLUSTERS DEVELOPING BETWEEN PINAR DEL RIO AND COLON IN 
CUBA...WITH NORTHWARD MOVEMENT. VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGE LOOPS SHOW A 
LARGE AREA OF HAZE IN A SUPPRESSED CONVECTIVE ENVIRONMENT OVER MUCH 
OF THE SOUTHERN BAHAMAS AND EASTERN CUBA. GEORGETOWN IN THE EXUMAS 
HAS BEEN REPORTING HAZE SINCE ABOUT 12Z...WITH VISIBILITIES 
OCCASIONALLY DROPPING TO 5SM. 

FORECAST:
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE LIKELY TO AFFECT MANY ISLAND 
COMMUNITIES THIS EVENING...MOVING SOUTH TO NORTH FROM CUBA AND THE 
STRAITS OF FLORIDA. BY MIDNIGHT...DRIER AND SLIGHTLY MORE STABLE 
AIRSTREAMS SHOULD BE IMPINGING ON THE SERVICE AREA FROM THE 
SOUTHEAST IN DEEPENING ANTICYCLONIC FLOW. FRIDAY IS LIKELY TO 
FEATURE HAZY SUNSHINE WITH ABUNDANT HIGH CLOUDINESS IN A SUPPRESSED 
CONVECTIVE REGIME. CLOUDS WILL BECOME FEWER FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY...BUT 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES SHOULD REMAIN LESS THAN 30 
PERCENT. THE LOW AND MID TROPOSPHERE WILL BEGIN TO MOISTEN AGAIN ON 
SATURDAY. FOR SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...A TYPICAL MOIST AND 
CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE WEATHER REGIME SHOULD BE IN PLACE WITHIN 
DEEPENING EASTERLY FLOW. LOOK FOR PERTURBATIONS IN THE EASTERLY FLOW 
TO INDUCE SUBTLE CHANGES TO MOISTURE/INSTABILITY/WIND FIELDS WHICH 
WILL HAVE A LARGE INFLUENCE ON DAILY WEATHER. TEMPERATURE AND 
PRECIPITATION FORECASTS WILL BE CLOSE TO CLIMATOLOGY FOR THIS TIME 
FRAME. 
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE SOUTH BREEZES THIS EVENING WITH LOCALLY HIGHER WINDS AROUND 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL TURN SOUTHEAST NEAR 10KT AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. GENTLE TO MODERATE EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZES FRIDAY WILL 
BECOME MAINLY EAST ON SATURDAY...WITH SOME FRESHENING TO NEAR 15KT 
OVER THE STRAITS SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THIS EVENING ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO 
KEY WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. THUNDERSTORMS ON THE 
MAINLAND WILL WILL REMAIN ISOLATED IN COVERAGE WITHIN THE ROUTE 
CORRIDOR...AND ANY OCCURRENCE OF THUNDER AT THE TERMINALS WILL BE OF 
BRIEF DURATION. MEAN STORM MOTION SHOULD BE APPROX 20012KT WITH MOST

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING REVEALED 24-HOUR GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT 
RISES AT EVERY LEVEL OF THE ATMOSPHERE...WITH AN INCREASE IN MSL 
PRESSURE OF 2.3MB. A BUILDING ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE IS NOW THE 
PRIMARY GOVERNING SYNOPTIC FEATURE ACROSS THE REGION. A WEAKENING 
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE HAS MOVED NORTHWEST ACROSS THE KEYS 
OVERNIGHT AND IS NOW ELONGATING AND GETTING PULLED NORTH BY A 
DIGGING MIDLATITUDE TROUGH. HOWEVER...THE SOUNDING ALSO REVEALED A 
VERY MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...WITH NO CONVECTIVE 
INHIBITION. DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW A LARGE MULTICELL CONVECTIVE 
CLUSTER WEAKENING ACROSS THE GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER 
KEYS...WITH NEWLY DEVELOPING HEAVY SHOWERS MOVING OVER PORTIONS OF 
THE UPPER KEYS. GOES-12 VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGE LOOPS SHOW A LARGE 
AREA OF CONVECTION BETWEEN WESTERN CUBA AND SWAN ISLAND...PROBABLY 
BEING ENHANCED BY BOTH A TROPICAL WAVE AND TRADE WIND CONVERGENCE. 
MEANWHILE...VISIBLE IMAGERY ALSO SHOWS A LARGE REGION OF HAZE WITHIN 
A VERY SUPPRESSED CONVECTIVE ENVIRONMENT OVER EASTERN CUBA...THE 
SOUTHERN BAHAMAS...TURKS AND CAICOS..HISPANIOLA...AND PUERTO RICO. 
THIS AIR MASS IS MOVING TOWARD THE KEYS.

CONVECTION OVER CUBA WILL BE THE MAIN QUESTION MARK FOR THE FORECAST 
OVER THE NEXT 12 HOURS. STEERING FLOW WILL BE VERY FAVORABLE FOR 
MOVEMENT OF CUBAN CELLS AND OUTFLOWS TOWARD THE KEYS...ABOUT 
190/15KT. IN ADDITION...THE DRIER AND STABLE SAHARAN AIR LAYER HAS 
STILL NOT PENETRATED TO THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS...CENTRAL CUBA...OR 
STRAITS OF FLORIDA...SO THE THERMODYNAMIC ENVIRONMENT SHOULD REMAIN 
FAVORABLE FOR CONVECTION EVEN LATER THIS AFTERNOON. 

FORECASTS WILL MAINTAIN HIGH POPS FOR LATER THIS AFTERNOON. THERE IS 
A GOOD CHANCE FOR RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH NORTHWARD MOVING CELLS 
INTO EARLY THIS EVENING. A RAPID TRANSITION TO A MORE STABLE AIR 
MASS WILL OCCUR OVERNIGHT.
&&

.MARINE...
FRESH SOUTH BREEZES THAT WERE FEEDING INTO THE CONVECTIVE CLUSTER 
NORTH OF THE KEYS HAVE SLACKENED SOMEWHAT...BUT MODERATE SOUTH 
BREEZES NEAR 15KT SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH THE REST OF THIS AFTERNOON. 
WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE LOCALLY HIGHER IN AND NEAR THUNDERSTORMS. 
LIGHTNING STRIKES WILL ALSO BE A THREAT...ESPECIALLY LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON.

&&
.AVIATION...
THROUGH AFTERNOON...WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED IFR 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FIGHT 
ROUTE. ISLAND TERMINALS WILL LIKELY BE AFFECTED A TIME OR TWO BY 
PASSING SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS...ESPECIALLY AFTER 18Z. 
THE STRONGER SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL PRODUCE WIND GUSTS NEAR 30  
KNOTS...RESULTING IN BRIEF BUT SIGNIFICANT CROSSWINDS AT BOTH 
TERMINALS. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM CONVECTIVELY DISTURBED 
ENVIRONMENTS WILL GENERALLY BE SOUTH AT 10-15KT.

.DISCUSSION...
WATER VAPOR AND IR IMAGES SUGGEST THE UPPER LOW HAS TRANSLATED NORTH 
OF THE ISLAND CHAIN...TO BE VERY NEAR CAPE SABLE OR SLIGHTLY NORTH 
OF THERE. SURFACE ANALYSIS HAS AN EXTENSION OF THE ATLANTIC SURFACE 
RIDGE ACROSS THE KEYS AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC WATERS. AREAS OF SHOWERS 
WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FLARED ACROSS MUCH OF THE KEYS 
SERVICE AREA LAST EVENING AND EARLY THIS MORNING. LATEST LOOP SHOWS 
THE BULK OF ECHOES ARE NOW FAVORING THE GULF SIDE OF THE ISLAND 
CHAIN...WITH A STRONGER CONCENTRATION RIGHT ALONG THE SOUTHWEST 
COAST OF THE MAINLAND. ISOLATED TO SCATTERED RETURNS ARE JUST OFF 
THE UPPER KEYS ON THE ATLANTIC SIDE...AND ANOTHER SPOT JUST NORTH OF 
DRY TORTUGAS. AWAY FROM THE TRAVERSING SHOWERS/TSTMS...WINDS ARE 
MODERATE OUT OF THE SOUTH. TEMPERATURES ARE AROUND 80 DEGREES ALONG 
THE ISLANDS.

.FORECAST...
ALTHOUGH THE UPPER PATTERN HAS NOT EVOLVED AS DEPICTED BY PREVIOUS 
MODEL RUNS...THE LOCAL AREA WILL REMAIN UNSETTLED AT LEAST FOR ONE 
MORE DAY. THE LOW OVER SOUTHWEST FLORIDA WILL EVENTUALLY BE ABSORBED 
INTO A BROADER UPPER TROUGH DROPPING THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST. DEEP 
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL KEEP A LIKELY CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS 
TODAY...ESPECIALLY WITH THE BEHAVIOR OF ACTIVITY OVER THE PAST 
EVENING AND EARLY THIS MORNING. SUPPORT FOR HIGHER POPS CAN BE SEEN 
UPSTREAM ON SATELLITE AND WITH LONG RANGE RADAR ECHOES CURRENTLY 
PULLING ACROSS CUBA. SO...WILL ADD ANOTHER 10 PERCENT ON THE POPS 
TODAY AND BE A LITTLE MORE PESSIMISTIC ON CLOUD COVER GRIDS. RAIN 
CHANCES BEGIN TO DIMINISH TONIGHT AS THE UPPER PATTERN FILLS 
LOCALLY...THE SURFACE RIDGE BECOMES MORE PRONOUNCED ACROSS SOUTH 
FLORIDA...AND THE ONSET OF DRIER AIR IS FELT. BY FRIDAY...RAIN 
CHANCES ARE QUITE LOW...AS REFLECTED IN BOTH NAM AND GFS MOS 
NUMBERS. WILL KEEP A 20 POP FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. THE ONLY 
OTHER GRID MODIFICATION IN THE SHORT TERM WILL BE TO THE SURFACE 
WIND GRIDS...VEERING THEM JUST LITTLE MORE TODAY AND EARLY THIS 
EVENING. NO CHANGES TO THE LONG RANGE PORTION OF THE FORECAST AS A 
MORE SEASONAL EAST/SOUTHEAST GENTLE/MODERATE FLOW SETS IN.

&&

.MARINE...
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED JUST 
ABOUT ANYTIME TODAY ACROSS ALL MARINE ZONES. BOATERS SHOULD BE 
PREPARED FOR A MODERATE PACE TO ANY ACTIVITY TODAY AND THIS EVENING.
BY TONIGHT... SHOWER/STORM COVERAGE WILL BE ON THE WANE...AND A 
FAIRER WEATHER PATTERN WITH EAST OR SOUTHEAST BREEZES WILL SET IN 
FOR FRIDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS MORNING AND INTO THIS 
AFTERNOON...WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED IFR 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FIGHT 
ROUTE. BOTH ISLAND TERMINALS WILL LIKELY BE AFFECTED A TIME OR TWO 
BY PASSING SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS...BUT EXACT TIMING OF 
THIS ACTIVITY IS IMPOSSIBLE. THE STRONGER SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL 
PRODUCE WIND GUSTS NEAR 30  KNOTS...RESULTING IN BRIEF BUT 
SIGNIFICANT CROSSWINDS AT BOTH TERMINALS. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM

.CURRENTLY...
A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAS BEEN PUSHING NORTHWARD 
FROM THE CUBAN COAST FOR THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS AND WILL IMPACT THE 
MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. SOME OF THE LARGER 
STORMS EMBEDDED IN THE CLUSTER HAVE HAD DOPPLER ESTIMATED TOPS NEAR 
50K FEET...AND HEAVY RAIN CORES WITH 55 TO 60 DBZ EXTENDING TO NEAR 
20K FEET. DOPPLER ONE HOUR PRECIP ESTIMATES WITH THESE THUNDERSTORMS 
HAVE BEEN IN THE TWO INCH PLUS NEIGHBORHOOD...WITH THREE HOUR PRECIP 
TOTALS SHOWING A MAX OF THREE TO FOUR INCHES NEAR ISLAMORADA. RADAR 
ESTIMATED VELOCITIES HAVE BEEN RELATIVELY LOW...AND HIGHEST MEASURED 
GUST HAS BEEN 21 KNOTS AT LONG KEY. A SHORT LIVED FUNNEL CLOUD WAS 
REPORTED NORTH OF KEY WEST EARLIER...WITH NO FURTHER REPORTS.

OVERNIGHT AND TOMORROW...THE UPPER LEVEL LOW MENTIONED IN PREVIOUS 
DISCUSSIONS APPEARS ON INFRARED IMAGERY TO BE CENTERED SOMEWHERE 
NEAR THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS. MSAS 00Z WIND ANALYSIS HINTS OF A 
WEAK SURFACE TROF JUST TO THE WEST OF THE WARNING AREA...WHICH IS 
CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS ANALYSES. GIVEN THE ABOVE AND THE CURRENT 
BOUNDARY RICH ENVIRONMENT...EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO BE 
POSSIBLE ANYWHERE IN THE CWA THROUGH TOMORROW AFTERNOON.
 &&

.MARINE...
MARINERS CAN EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AT ANY TIME THROUGH 
TOMORROW. THE MAIN THREAT FROM THESE STORMS WILL BE VERY HEAVY RAIN 
AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING. WATERSPOUTS WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG CLOUD 
LINES...BUT AT THIS TIME ARE EXPECTED TO BE ONLY ISOLATED. EXPECT 
MODERATE SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WINDS OVER COASTAL WATERS OVERNIGHT AND 
TOMORROW.

&&

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...MID AND UPPER LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE SLOWLY 
WESTWARD...WITH A TROUGH IN THE LOW LEVELS ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA. 
SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS WITH WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE FOUND ACROSS THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE. PERIODIC MVFR/IFR 
WITH ISOLATED LIFR CEILINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITHIN THESE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS...BUT THESE CONDITIONS SHOULD NOT PREVAIL...LASTING 
LESS THAN 30 MINUTES AT THE KEYW OR KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. IN 
ADDITION...SURFACE WIND GUSTS TO 30 KNOTS ARE POSSIBLE IN THESE

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS AFTERNOON REVEALS A COMPLEX 
WEATHER PATTERN ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA...THE BAHAMAS...AND THE GREATER 
ANTILLES. AN UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE HAS MOVED LITTLE DURING THE 
LAST SIX HOURS AND AT 18Z WAS STILL CENTERED OVER THE CAY SAL BANK. 
ENHANCED CONVECTION IS EVIDENT IN SATELLITE IMAGE LOOPS OVER A LARGE 
AREA EAST AND SOUTH OF THE SYSTEM...OVER THE BAHAMAS...CUBA... 
JAMAICA...AND ADJACENT WATERS. THIS REGION OF ENHANCED CONVECTION 
APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH BOTH THE UPPER CYCLONE AND LARGE-SCALE 
TRADE WIND SPEED CONVERGENCE EAST OF A TROPICAL WAVE AND ALONG THE 
SOUTHWESTERN FLANK OF THE ATLANTIC SUBTROPICAL ANTICYCLONE. A LARGE 
SAHARAN AIR LAYER WAS LOCATED SOUTHEAST OF THE REGION OF ENHANCED 
CONVECTION... ACROSS MUCH OF HISPANIOLA...PUERTO RICO...AND EASTERN 
CARIBBEAN. CONVECTION HERE IS CLEARLY SUPPRESSED PER SATELLITE 
IMAGERY...AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS SHOW A LOT OF HAZY SUNSHINE AND 
FRESH TRADES. A BROAD AND WEAK SURFACE TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
UPPER CYCLONE WAS LOCATED ACROSS PORTIONS OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND 
ADJACENT WATERS...WITH AN AXIS OVER THE GULF WEST OF THE KEYS.

PULSE-CELL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEEN DEVELOPING READILY IN 
THE MOIST...CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE...AND WEAK-SHEAR ENVIRONMENT IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS. LATEST MEAN CELL MOTION 
VECTOR IS ABOUT 170/11KT. ABUNDANT MORNING SUN HAS GIVEN WAY TO 
RAPIDLY DEVELOPING THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE SEA BREEZE ACROSS 
PORTIONS OF WESTERN CUBA. SOME OF THESE STORMS WILL DEPART THE NORTH 
COAST OF CUBA WITH A HEADING TOWARD THE KEYS IN THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS.   

FORECAST:
A DISTURBED WEATHER REGIME SHOULD PERSIST ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS 
AND ADJOINING WATERS FOR ABOUT THE NEXT 24-36 HOURS...WITH ATTENDANT 
HIGHER CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES. BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...DRIER AIR 
AND ANTICYCLONIC FLOW WILL SET IN ACROSS THE KEYS...WITH LOWER CLOUD 
COVER AND RAIN CHANCES. LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC TRAJECTORY FORECASTS FROM 
THE GFS SHOW AIR PARCELS ARRIVING IN THE KEYS SATURDAY MORNING 
ORIGINATING NEAR PUERTO RICO TODAY...SO THERE IS A GOOD CHANCE THAT 
THE SAHARAN AIR LAYER CURRENTLY ACROSS PORTIONS OF EASTERN CARIBBEAN 
WILL OVERSPREAD OUR REGION BY LATE FRIDAY...WITH ABUNDANT HAZY 
SUNSHINE.

TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY - A MOIST...UNSTABLE AIR MASS WITHIN A 
WEAK...CYCLONIC FLOW REGIME WILL REMAIN IN PLACE WITH HIGHER THAN 
AVERAGE CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES. AN UPPER CYCLONE WILL DRIFT 
WEST-SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA WHILE WEAKENING. A 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL STRENGTHEN AND BUILD WESTWARD 
ACROSS THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC. THE ASSOCIATED RIDGE WILL EXTEND 
WEST-SOUTHWEST ACROSS EASTERN CUBA BY THURSDAY MORNING.

THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY - THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE WILL 
MOVE NORTH ACROSS THE KEYS AND EXTEND ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA 
BY FRIDAY NIGHT. A MUCH DRIER AIR MASS 925-600MB ASSOCIATED WITH A 
SAHARAN AIR LAYER WILL ARRIVE...AND PROBABLY HELP SQUELCH 
CONVECTION. 

SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY - EASTERLIES WILL LIKELY DEEPEN EACH DAY 
WITH A GRADUAL INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. LOOK FOR 
PERTURBATIONS IN THE EASTERLY FLOW TO INDUCE SUBTLE CHANGES TO 
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY/WIND FIELDS WHICH WILL HAVE A LARGE INFLUENCE 
ON DAILY WEATHER. FORECASTS WILL BE CLOSE TO CLIMATOLOGY FOR THIS 
TIME FRAME.
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE SOUTH BREEZES SHOULD PREVAIL OVERNIGHT...BUT WILL BE

EARLY MORNING SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THE UPPER LEVEL LOW JUST EAST OF 
THE UPPER KEYS WITH DIGGING ENERGY CONTINUING TO SWEEP SOUTHWARD 
ALONG ITS SOUTHWESTERN PERIPHERY. SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN INTIAL 
WINDSHIFT SLIGHTLY SOUTH OF EAST HAS ALREADY OCCURRED OVER MUCH OF 
THE SERVICE AREA...WITH A DISCERNABLE TROUGH AXIS JUST TO THE WEST 
OF MARQUESAS KEYS AT THIS HOUR. THE MOVEMENT OF SPECKLED ECHOES ON 
KBYX RADAR SUPPORT THE POSITION OF THIS AXIS. MOST OF THE SHOWERS 
ARE LIGHT TO MODERATE...ALTHOUGH A FEW STRIKES OF LIGHTNING HAVE 
BEEN DETECTED OUT IN THE STRAITS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. 
TEMPERATURES ALONG THE ISLANDS RANGE FROM 80 TO 83 DEGREES WITH 
DEWPOINTS VERY CLOSE TO 73 DEGREES.

.FORECAST...
AS HAS BEEN THE CASE OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS...THE NAM AND GFS 
HAVE NOT SUPPLIED GOOD AGREEMENT FOR THE LOCAL AREA AS FAR AS THE 
EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER LOW AND ITS REFLECTION IN LOWER 
ALTITUDES...LET ALONE ANY SUBLTE FEATURES THAT WILL BE TRAVERSING

SOUTH...AND STRONGER THAN ON PREVIOUS RUNS WITH THE HIGH LEVEL 
CYCLONIC CIRCULATION. WITH LATEST UPPER SIGNALS...THAT SEEMS AT 
LEAST MORE REASONABLE THAN THE NAM AT THIS POINT...BUT THEN IT 
QUICKLY PLUNKS A CONVECTIVE BULLSEYE ON OUR SOUTHEAST DOORSTEP EARLY 
THURSDAY MORNING. WILL BE DEVIATING FROM THE SHORT RANGE MOS NUMBERS 
WHICH ARE QUITE LOW FOR BOTH THE NAM AND GFS. I WILL MAINTAIN THE 
GRIDS ON THE HIGHER END OF CHANCE...AND ALLOW THAT TO CONTINUE ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH THURSDAY. BY FRIDAY...GFS PULLS DRAWS IN A DRY 
POCKET FROM THE SOUTHEAST AND ITS EXTENDED MOS DROPS POPS DOWN TO A 
SLIGHT CHANCE. THAT MAY BE SUSPECT ON A DEEP S/SE FLOW...BUT NAM IS 
EVEN DRIER ALL THE WAY DOWN TO 5 KFT. DO NOT HAVE CONFIDENCE ENOUGH 
AT THIS TIME TO ADJUST ANY LATE PERIOD GRIDS. WIND-SIDE...GFS IS 
VEERING THE PROFILE EVEN FURTHER LATE WED NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
EVENING THAN PREVIOUSLY. FLOW WILL BE RELATIVELY LIGHT THROUGH THE 
LOWER LAYERS...SO ONLY A MINOR GRID ADJUSTMENT WILL BE IMPLEMENTED 
THEN. UPPED THE UPCOMING OVERNIGHT TEMPS A DEGREE MOST LOCATIONS 
ALONG THE ISLANDS.

&&

.MARINE...
WINDS IN ALL MARINE ZONES WILL BE INITIATED OUT OF THE E/SE...AND

.CURRENTLY...
CONVECTION ROLLED OFF THE SOUTHWEST FLORIDA SEABREEZE EARLIER THIS 
EVENING...WITH A VIGOROUS CELL AOBUT 25 NM NORTH OF KEY WEST. LOW 
LEVEL WINDS BACKED TO EAST NORTHEAST ALLOWING A LEE CONVERGENCE LINE 
TO SWING MORE ENE-TO-WSW...BECOMING A STANDARD CUMULUS LINE. BRIEF 
SHOWERS DEVELOPED AND BRIEFLY DAMPENED STREETS ON THE SOUTHSIDE OF 
KEY WEST. CURRENTLY TEMPERATURES ARE FALLING THROUGH THE MID 80S. 
WINDS HAVE VEERED OUT OF THE EAST 10 TO 15 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS. 
ALONG THE REEF WINDS HAVE FRESHENED AND ARE RUNNING NEAR 15 KNOTS 
ALONG THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS WITH OCCASIONAL GUSTS OVER 20 KNOTS. 
THE EVENING SOUNDING CONTINUED TO SHOW DEEP DRY LAYERS FROM 725 MB 
THROUGH 500 MB...AND AGAIN ABOVE 400 MB. PRECIPITABLE WATER REMAINED 
FAIRLY LOW...1.58 INCHES...TYPICAL FOR THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A 
COLD CORE UPPER LOW. IR SATELLITE INDICATES SOME ENHANCEMENT OF 
MID/HIGH ALTITUDE CLOUDS FROM THE EVERGLADES THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE/UPPER KEYS AND UPPER STRAITS.  

.FORECAST...
A COLD MID/UPPER LOW IS CENTERED BETWEEN ANDROS ISLAND AND 
MIAMI...DRIFTING SLOWLY WEST. A SURFACE TROUGH IS DRIFTING WEST IN 
TANDEM AND IS CURRENTLY POSITIONED WEST OF NASSAU. VWP FROM KBYX 
RADAR INDICATES EAST WINDS NEAR 15 KNOTS. JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE 
WITH NORTHEAST WINDS FROM 4K THROUGH 17K FEET. THIS MATCHES FAIRLY 
WELL THE GFS TIME-HEIGHT SECTIONS FOR OVERNIGHT. THUS EXPECT WINDS 
TO VEER BY SUNRISE WITH THE UPPER LOW PASSING THROUGH THE KEYS OR 
EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA. INSTABILITY WILL INCREASE AND SOUTHEAST WINDS 
WILL RAPIDLY INCREASE MOISTURE LEVELS. KMIA RADAR INDICATES 
SCATTERED SHOWERS RETURNING TO THE WATERS EAST OF MIAMI...AND MOVING

347 PM EDT TUE JUL 4 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS AT 18Z PLACED THE CENTER OF AN 
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC COLD-CORE CYCLONE AT NEAR 25.60N/79.00W...OR JUST 
SOUTHEAST OF BIMINI. THE SYSTEM IS NOW MOVING TOWARD THE SOUTH- 
SOUTHWEST...AND MAINTAINS A STRUCTURE WITH ENHANCED CONVECTION ON 
ITS EASTERN AND SOUTHERN FLANKS. A SUPPRESSED CONVECTIVE ENVIRONMENT 
HAS BEEN PREVALENT LOCALLY OWING TO DRIER AND MORE STABLY STRATIFIED 
AIR IN THE 1000-700MB LAYER...DESPITE A FAVORABLE LOW-LEVEL FLOW 
FROM THE NORTHEAST. DEWPOINTS ARE EVEN DOWN A FEW DEGREES AT THE 
SURFACE...IN THE LOWER 70S INSTEAD OF THE MID 70S A DAY AGO. AN AIR 
MASS WITH HIGHER TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER LIES JUST EAST OF THE 
SERVICE AREA ACCORDING TO GOES SOUNDER-DERIVED DATA. ALSO...A 
LOW-LEVEL INVERTED TROUGH...A REFLECTION OF THE UPPER CYCLONE...IS 
NOW EVIDENT IN THE SFC-850MB LAYER FROM THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS 
SOUTH-SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE CAY SAL BANK AND CENTRAL CUBA. 

FORECAST:
THE UPPER CYCLONE WILL LIKELY DECELERATE AS IT MOVES SOUTHWESTWARD 
ACROSS THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA AND CUBA DURING THE NEXT 24-48 
HOURS...WHILE THE LOW-LEVEL TROUGH AXIS MOVES WEST ACROSS THE 
SERVICE AREA DURING THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS. RAIN CHANCES ARE TRICKY 
THIS EVENING BECAUSE IF ANY CONVECTION DEVELOPS OVER MAINLAND SOUTH 
FLORIDA...IT AND ASSOCIATED OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL BE POISED TO 
MOVE DIRECTLY TOWARD THE KEYS IN NORTHEASTERLY STEERING FLOW. SO FAR 
TODAY...CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED OVER THE MAINLAND... 
BUT THIS COULD CHANGE QUICKLY BEFORE SUNSET. OVERNIGHT...WE WILL SEE 
A TRANSITION IN THE LOW-LEVEL FLOW AS THE TROUGH MOVES WEST ACROSS 
THE REGION. AFTER A RAIN-FREE LULL...WE COULD SEE INCREASING SHOWER 
AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE BY DAYBREAK IN MOIST...UNSTABLE...AND 
CONFLUENT LOW-LEVEL FLOW FROM THE EAST-SOUTHEAST. HIGHEST RAIN 
CHANCES ARE PEGGED FOR THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY TIME FRAME... 
AS MOISTURE/INSTABILITY FIELDS AND STEERING FLOW FROM THE SOUTH WILL 
BE MOST FAVORABLE FOR CONVECTIVE INITIATION. A LOW-LEVEL ATLANTIC 
RIDGE SHOULD SET IN AGAIN NORTH OF THE KEYS BY ABOUT FRIDAY... 
RETURNING THE ISLAND CHAIN TO A CLIMATOLOGICAL EAST-SOUTHEAST FLOW 
REGIME. 
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE NORTHEAST TO EAST BREEZES WILL SHIFT TO EAST TO SOUTHEAST 
OVERNIGHT...AS A TROUGH AXIS MOVES THROUGH. SCATTERED SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE IS EXPECTED WITH LIGHTNING AND LOCALLY GUSTY 
WINDS THE PRIMARY THREATS.
&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE 
KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS.  
PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR VIS AND/OR CIGS WILL OCCUR WITH ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND DEVELOPING THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE ROUTE LAST THIS 
AFTERNOON. SCATTERED CONVECTIVE COVERAGE WILL OCCUR OVERNIGHT. THE 
STRONGER ACTIVITY MAY PRODUCE SURFACE WIND GUSTS AROUND 30 KNOTS. 
NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OF 10-12 KNOTS THIS AFTERNOON...WILL 
GRADUALLY SHIFT TO THE EAST THIS EVENING AT 8-10 KNOTS.

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING REVEALED A WEAKLY UNSTABLE 
STRATIFICATION WITH A MLCAPE OF ONLY 428 J/KG USING A T/TD OF 
86F/73F. THE SBCAPE WAS 2714 J/KG USING THE SAME NUMBERS. IN 
ADDITION...DRIER AIR HAS ADVECTED IN FROM THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST 
THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS. 
AS SUCH...IT IS...AT LEAST TEMPORARILY...MUCH DRIER AND MORE STABLE 
THAN IT WAS 24 HOURS AGO. GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS SHOW 
A STRONG UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC COLD-CORE CYCLONE SPINNING SOUTH ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS...WITH THE ENHANCED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ON THE 
EASTERN AND SOUTHERN FLANKS. UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC NORTHERLIES WERE 
BLOWING UP TO 60-70KT DOWN THE SPINE OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA... 
ALONG THE WESTERN FLANK OF THE UPPER CYCLONE. UPPER MASS CONVERGENCE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONFLUENT FLOW ALOFT PROBABLY HELPED TO 
STABILIZE THE ATMOSPHERE AS WELL AS CONTRIBUTE TO THE DRYING.

LATEST MEASUREMENTS FROM THE KEY WEST DOPPLER WIND PROFILER SHOW A 
WIND VECTOR OF ABOUT 065/09KT IN THE LOWEST 4000FT AGL...A VERY 
FAVORABLE ORIENTATION FOR BOTH LOWER KEYS TCU/CB LINE DEVELOPMENT 
AND MOVEMENT OF CONVECTIVE CELLS OFF MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA TOWARDS 
PORTIONS OF THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. DESPITE THE DRIER AIR 
MEASURED BY KEY WEST AND MIAMI SOUNDINGS...A NICE-LOOKING CUMULUS 
FIELD IS DEVELOPING ALREADY...PER GOES-12 VISIBLE CHANNEL 
IMAGES...OVER MUCH OF SOUTH FLORIDA AND PORTIONS OF THE KEYS.

BASICALLY...WE EXPECT SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OVER MAINLAND 
SOUTH FLORIDA WITH A MOVEMENT TOWARD THE KEYS LATER THIS AFTERNOON. 
THE COVERAGE MAY BE CUT DOWN SOME BY DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT. HOWEVER... 
SCATTERED CONVECTIVE COVERAGE IS A GOOD BET LOCALLY...AND THIS IS 
WHAT THE CURRENT FORECAST CONTAINS. WE WILL ALSO WATCH FOR TCU/CB 
LINES OVER AND ALONG THE KEYS...PARTICULARLY LOWER KEYS... WITH 
WATERSPOUTS AND LIGHTNING STRIKES POTENTIAL HAZARDS.
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE BREEZES FROM THE NORTHEAST OR EAST ARE EXPECTED THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS IN AND NEAR SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. LIGHTNING STRIKES WILL PRESENT THE 
GREATEST THREAT FROM THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.
&&

.AVIATION...
THROUGH 17Z...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. ISOLATED MVFR 
SHOWERS THIS MORNING WILL REMAIN ON THE FLORIDA EAST COAST...MAINLY 
OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS BETWEEN KMIA AND KMTH. PERIODS OF MVFR TO 
IFR VIS AND/OR CIGS WILL OCCUR WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING LATE THIS MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON. MOST 
OF THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE FOUND OVER THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF SOUTH 
FLORIDA THIS AFTERNOON...AND PRESS SOUTHWESTWARD INTO THE ADJOINING 
GULF AND BAY WATERS THIS EVENING. THE STRONGER ACTIVITY MAY PRODUCE 
SURFACE WIND GUSTS AROUND 30 TO 40 KNOTS. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM 
CONVECTIVE FLOWS WILL BE NORTHEAST AT 10-12 KNOTS.

ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS THIS MORNING HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS ALL THE WAY TO THE WATERS SOUTH OF MARQUESAS KEYS. 
THESE ECHOES ON KBYX RADAR HAVE BEEN MOVING SOUTHWEST NEAR 15 KNOTS. 
OTHERWISE...EARLY MORNING IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW UPPER CLOUDS 
THINNING OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO MOVING SOUTHWARD ON THE 
WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE UPPER LOW. BESIDES THE SHOWERS IN THE 
STRAITS...NOT MUCH MORE IN THE WAY OF LOWER CLOUDS IN OUR SERVICE 
AREA. MODERATE EAST TO NORTHEAST WINDS LATE YESTERDAY EVENING AND 
EARLY THIS MORNING HAVE VEERED IN THE SERVICE AREA...WHILE 
TEMPERATURES ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE IN THE LOWER 80S.

.FORECAST...
TO VARYING DEGREES...THE SHORT RANGE GUIDANCE ALLOWS A SINKING 
INTRUSION OF MID LEVEL DRY AIR INTO THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT. MOS 
POP VALUES HAVE LATCHED ONTO THIS AND ARE GIVING ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES 
FOR BOTH PERIODS DOWN THE ENTIRE LENGTH OF THE ISLANDS. INSTABILITY 
REMAINS ALIGNED OVER THE REGION AND WITH THE CONTINUED APPROACH OF 
THE SURFACE TROUGH FROM THE BAHAMAS AND INSTABILITY IN PLACE...WILL 
ADJUST THE GRIDS DOWN JUST A LITTLE BUT KEEP MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
CHANCE NUMBERS. WE SHOULD SEE SOME CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SLIDING 
OFF THE MAINLAND THROUGH THE BAY AND OFF THE SOUTHWEST COAST THROUGH 
THE GULF WATERS THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. WE BEGIN TO SEE 
DEEP MOISTURE WORKING BACK IN EARLY WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS 
THE TROUGH EXITS TO OUR WEST AND THE TROPOSPHERIC FLOW BECOMES 
UNIFORMLY SOUTHEASTERLY. WILL STICK CLOSE TO THE LATEST EXTENDED GFS 
MOS NUMBERS DURING THOSE PERIODS...WHICH IS CLOSE TO WHAT IS ALREADY 
IN THE GRIDS. NARROW BUT DEEP RIDGING CONTROLS THE LATER HALF OF 
THIS WEEK...WITH THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REBUILDING TO THE NORTH 
IN THE LATE PERIODS. SO NO REASON TO ADJUST THOSE LATE PERIODS OF 
THE FORECAST.

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THIS MORNING ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT

.CURRENTLY...
EARLIER THIS EVENING...SEVERAL CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WHICH FORMED OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND STRENGTHENED AS THEY 
TRAVERSED SOUTHWEST INTO THE FLORIDA BAY...AND INTO THE NEARSHORE 
GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. CURRENTLY...ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE MIGRATING SOUTH SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE NEARSHORE 
AND OFFSHORE ATLANTIC WATERS SOUTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN. LATEST 
SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE EXTENDING ACROSS 
THE GULF COAST REGION...WITH C-MAN STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS 
INDICATING NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS. 
OTHERWISE...OUR EVENING SOUNDING REVEALS A TYPICAL MOIST (PWAT 1.88 
INCHES) AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE (CAPE 2183 J/KG) AIRMASS WITHIN A 
DEEP NORTHEAST FLOW REACHING UP TO 550 MB...BEFORE BECOMING NORTH 
ABOVE. 

.FORECAST...
THE COMBINATION OF AMPLE MOISTURE WITHIN THE DEEP NORTHEAST FLOW AND 
TYPICAL NOCTURNAL ENHANCEMENT...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD REDEVELOP OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...SINCE THE MAIN 
SOURCE OF THIS EVENINGS DEEP AND WET CONVECTION WAS THE SOUTH 
FLORIDA MAINLAND...A MORE NORTHEAST FLOW WILL PROMPT AN ADJUSTMENT 
TO THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST TO LOWER POPS TO 30 PERCENT. 
&&

.MARINE...
OUR EVENING RAWINDSONDE SHOWS NORTHEAST WINDS OF 6 AND 9 KNOTS AT 1

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS REVEAL AN UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC 
COLD-CORE CYCLONE MOVING SOUTHWARD OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS JUST 
NORTH OF GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND. FURTHER ANALYSIS OF THIS FEATURE 
INDICATES THAT THE SYSTEM IS BEST DEFINED AT ABOUT 300MB...WITH A 
SHARP TROUGH DOWN TO 500MB. A HIGHER COVERAGE OF CLOUDS...SHOWERS... 
AND THUNDERSTORMS IS EVIDENT IN RADAR AND SATELLITE IMAGERY ALONG 
THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN FLANKS OF THE SYSTEM OVER MUCH OF THE 
BAHAMAS...WHERE STRONGEST SYNOPTIC-SCALE LIFT IS CENTERED. LATEST 
KEY WEST DOPPLER VAD WIND PROFILE MEASUREMENTS SHOW THE LOWER- 
TROPOSPHERIC FLOW HAVING BACKED FROM EARLIER THIS MORNING...NOW 
AVERAGING ABOUT 080/10KT. NUMERICAL MODEL ANALYSES FROM 12Z SUGGEST 
THAT A LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC REFLECTION OF THE UPPER TROUGH EXISTS OVER 
THE BAHAMAS IN THE FORM OF A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH...AND THIS MAY 
HELP EXPLAIN THE LOCALLY BACKED WIND FLOW.

LOCAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SO FAR TODAY HAS BEEN CHARACTERISTIC OF A 
TYPICAL DIURNAL MODE...WITH FAST-DEVELOPING...SHORT-LIVED PULSE 
CELLS INCREASING IN COVERAGE NEAR LAND AREAS WITH OCEANIC CONVECTION 
WANING. 

FORECAST:
THE UPPER CYCLONE CURRENTLY CENTERED JUST NORTH OF THE BAHAMAS WILL 
BE THE PRIMARY SYNOPTIC-SCALE FEATURE OF INTEREST FOR THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS. THE SYSTEM WILL LIKELY MOVE SOUTH FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS ALONG 
THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF A LARGE DEEP LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES AND GULF OF MEXICO. THEN...FROM 24-72 
HOURS...THE SYSTEM WILL MOST LIKELY MOVE IN A GENERALLY WEST OR 
SOUTHWEST DIRECTION WHILE SLOWLY WEAKENING. IN DOING SO...THE SYSTEM 
WILL COME VERY NEAR THE FLORIDA KEYS. THE SLOW WEST OR SOUTHWEST 
MOVEMENT WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO FALLING GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHTS TO THE 
WEST AND RISING HEIGHTS TO THE EAST. BY THURSDAY...THE SYSTEM SHOULD 
BE LOCATED WEST OR NORTHWEST OF THE SERVICE AREA...AS A LARGE DEEP 
LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE BUILDS WEST ACROSS THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC.

A DEVELOPING TROUGH IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE OVER THE BAHAMAS WILL 
LIKELY MOVE THROUGH SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS DURING THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS. THE COMBINATION OF A MOIST SFC-700MB LAYER...CONDITIONAL 
INSTABILITY...FAVORABLE ORIENTATIONS OF CONVECTIVE STEERING 
FLOW...AND ENHANCED SYNOPTIC-SCALE LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH CONFLUENT 
BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW WARRANTS ABOVE-AVERAGE RAIN CHANCES...AND WE 
WILL INDICATE 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES OF AROUND 50 PERCENT TONIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH A RETURN TO CLIMATOLOGY THEREAFTER.
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE NORTHEAST TO EAST BREEZES TONIGHT AND TUESDAY WILL SHIFT TO 
SOUTHEAST BY WEDNESDAY AS A LOW-LEVEL TROUGH AXIS PASSES BY AND 
ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE REBUILDS. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE EXPECTED THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK...WITH PRIMARY HAZARDS BEING 
LIGHTNING STRIKES AND LOCALLY HIGHER WINDS AND SEAS.

.AVIATION...
THROUGH 12Z TUESDAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE

A MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH A MLCAPE OF 1113 
J/KG FOR A SURFACE T/TD OF 86/75. KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SHOWS 
SCATTERED UNICELLULAR CONVECTIVE CELLS MOVING WEST NEAR 10KT ACROSS 
THE SERVICE AREA. ISOLATED SHORT-LIVED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED 
FROM THE STRONGER CELLS...WITH ANVIL CLOUD MATERIAL BEING BLOWN 
SWIFTLY TO THE SOUTH IN MODERATELY STRONG UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC FLOW. 

A SHARP TROUGH 100-500MB IS REVEALED BY GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL 
IMAGERY OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC FROM THE FLORIDA EAST COAST 
EXTENDING NORTHEASTWARD FOR SEVERAL HUNDRED MILES. A LARGE REGION OF 
ASCENT IS EVIDENT OVER MUCH OF THE BAHAMAS AND ATLANTIC WATERS TO 
THE NORTHEAST...BENEATH THE FAVORABLE EASTERN FLANK OF THE UPPER 
TROUGH...WITH SUBSIDENCE NORTH AND WEST OF THE TROUGH AXIS. THE 
FLORIDA KEYS APPEAR TO LIE WITHIN A NEUTRAL REGION WITH NEITHER 
DISCERNIBLE ASCENT NOR SUBSIDENCE ON THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE. MODERATE 
LOW-LEVEL EASTERLY FLOW HAS BEEN SUFFICIENT TO INITIATE CONVECTION 
WITH A LOW-ALTITUDE LFC AND NEAR-ZERO CONVECTIVE INHIBITION.

CURRENT FORECASTS INDICATE SCATTERED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY WITH MODERATE EAST BREEZES...AND THIS LOOKS VERY MUCH ON 
TARGET FOR THIS AFTERNOON. THEREFORE...NO UPDATES WILL BE NECESSARY.
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE EAST BREEZES WILL PREVAIL WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS. THUNDERSTORMS WILL DELIVER BRIEF PERIODS OF HEAVY

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
MORNING CONVECTION ACROSS THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS THROUGH THE GULF 
WATERS HAS DISSIPATED...HOWEVER KBYX INDICATES NEW CELLS FIRING FROM 
THE MARQUESAS TO NORTH OF DRY TORTUGAS...AND GENERATING ALONG AN 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM CONVECTION WHICH HAD BEEN OVER THE CAY SAL 
BANK. TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN SLOW TO RECOVER AND REMAIN IN THE MID 
80S ACROSS MARATHON...UP TO 88F AT KEY WEST WHERE THERE WAS BETTER 
SUN. RIGHT NOW A LARGE CANOPY OF CIRROSTRATUS CONVECTIVE DEBRIS 
CONTINUES. WINDS HAVE BEEN OUT OF THE EAST OR EAST-SOUTHEAST WITH 
SPEEDS 10 TO 15 KNOTS WITH OCCASIONAL HIGHER GUSTS.

.FORECAST...
AN UPPER TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE IS SLIDING WESTWARD INTO THE GULF OF 
MEXICO WHILE A SHORTWAVE TROUGH SINKS SOUTHWARD OFF THE SOUTHEAST 
U.S. COAST. THIS HAS ALLOWED A NORTH FLOW TO DEVELOP ABOVE 20K FEET. 
A LOW ALTITUDE TROUGH...THE NORTHERN EXTENSION OF A WEAK TROPICAL 
WAVE...HAS MOVED INTO THE EAST GULF OF MEXICO. DEEP BUT LIGHT 
SOUTHEAST FLOW CONTINUES OVER THE KEYS DUE TO A SURFACE RIDGE NEAR 
1024 MB ALONG THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST...KEEPING THE ATMOSPHERE 
MOISTURE RICH. WAS TRYING TO FIND A REASON FOR THE LACK OF ACTIVITY 
SOUTH OF THE LOWER KEYS TODAY...BUT EVEN GOES SOUNDER PWAT ESTIMATES 
WERE JUST OVER 2 INCHES. A MIX OF SLIGHT STABILITY ABOVE 800 MB AND 
SLIGHTLY LESS INSOLATION DUE TO CONVECTIVE DEBRIS...PERHAPS A LITTLE 
MESOSCALE SUBSIDENCE BETWEEN CUBA AND DRY TORTUGAS AS WELL...MAY 
HAVE BEEN THE CAUSE. FOR THE EVENING...THE PRE-EXISTING 
RAIN-STABILIZED REGIME ACROSS THE MIDDLE KEYS MAY ALLOW ACTIVITY TO 
REDEVELOP CLOSER TO THE LOWER KEYS. INDEED SEVERAL OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES ARE SEEN TO THE SOUTHEAST WHERE CONVECTION HAS PERSISTED 
ON THE WEST EDGE OF THE BAHAMA BANK.

TONIGHT...THE MAXIMIZED MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND LOW LEVEL VORTICITY 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE TROUGH HAS PROGRESSED AWAY FROM THE 
AREA...BUT THE NUMEROUS BOUNDARIES...HIGH MOISTURE AND DIFFERENTIAL 
HEATING WARRANTS HIGH CHANCE POPS TONIGHT. NAM IS FINALLY SETTLING 
DOWN AND COMING INTO LINE WITH THE GFS WITH SURFACE WINDS...SO NO 
SIGNIFICANT WIND SURGE IS EXPECTED TONIGHT.

MONDAY THROUGH INDEPENDENCE DAY EVENING...THE SURFACE RIDGE SLIPS 
SOUTHWARD BUT WEAKENS ONLY SLIGHTLY. ALOFT...AN UPPER POSITIVE-TILT 
TROUGH DIGS EAST OF FLORIDA BUT BROADENS AS IT GOES. THIS IMPARTS 
LIGHT WINDS ALOFT AND BIT OF A WEAKNESS IN TERMS OF FALLING HEIGHTS. 
THE GFS INSISTS ON ANOTHER SURGE IN PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES LATE 
TUESDAY WITH JUST ANOTHER HINT OF A LOW LEVEL TROUGH OR WEAK WAVE 
FEATURE PASSING WEST. BUMPED POPS TO 40 PERCENT FOR INDEPENDENCE DAY 
WITH THIS WEAK FEATURE. THIS TIME THE PRESSURE GRADIENT DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO TIGHTEN LEAVING A GENERAL EAST TO OCCASIONALLY SOUTHEAST 
FLOW ACROSS THE AREA.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND...STRONG RIDGING AMPLIFIES ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN ROCKIES...ALLOWING A DEEP TROUGH TO SWING THROUGH THE 
NORTHEAST LATE THIS WEEK. AN ATTENDENT COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE 
DEEP SOUTHEAST BY FRIDAY. THE AMPLIFICATION ALLOWS THE LOW TO MID 
LEVEL RIDGE DEVELOP MORE STRONGLY IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WITH A 
WEAK RIDGE BEING SUPPRESSED DOWN THE PENINSULA. EXPECT LIGHT 
SOUTHEAST FLOW. GFS INDICATES SOME DRIER POCKETS IN THE EASTERLIES

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1000 AM EDT SUN JUL 2 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SKIES RANGE FROM MOSTLY SUNNY IN THE LOWER KEYS TO MOSTLY CLOUDY IN 
THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS...WITH A BAND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
CONTINUING FROM PLANTATION KEY THROUGH FLORIDAY BAY...AND EXTENDING 
INTO THE GULF WATERS OFFSHORE MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY. A WEAK SURFACE 
TROUGH HAS MOVED JUST WEST OF THE SERVICE AREA...AND THE PRESSURE 
GRADIENT WITH A SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS THE CAROLINAS NEVER TIGHTENED.  
CLOSE BUT NOT ENOUGH...AS STRONGER EAST WINDS UP TO 25 KNOTS 
CONTINUE IN THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN. TEMPERATURES ARE CLIMBING 
THROUGH THE MID 80S. MORNING SOUNDING INDICATED A MUCAPE OF 4800 
J/KG...CURRENT SURFACE BASED CAPES ARE CLIMBING PAST 3500 J/KG. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER IS AROUND 2 INCHES...A BIT SHY OF GFS 
EXPECTATIONS. THERE IS A STABLE LAYER AROUND 800-750 MB...BUT THE 
500 MB TEMPERATURE IS -7.7C...2 DEGREES COOLER THAN 00Z.

.FORECAST...
MOISTURE IS PREVALENT AND ITS CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE...QUITE A BIT 
AT THAT. SURFACE MOISTURE FLUX CONVERGENCE WILL WEAKEN WITH THE 
SURFACE TROUGH TO THE WEST. AS TEMPERATURES CLIMB INTO THE UPPER 
80S...SMALL CLUSTERS OF CONVECTION ARE LIKELY TO ERUPT AND POSSIBLY 
FOCUS ALONG THE BOUNDARY BETWEEN THE MORNING RAIN-COOLED AIR AND THE 
WARMER LOWER KEYS. IT DOESNT TAKE MUCH SUN TO GET TO 90F THIS TIME 
OF YEAR...BUT TEMPERATURES MAY BE A DEGREE OR TWO LOWER THAN 
YESTERDAYS IF THE CONVECTIVE DEBRIS DOESNT THIN OUT BY LATE 
AFTERNOON OVER THE UPPER KEYS. NAM HAS NOT HANDLED THE SITUATION 
WELL PAST DAY OR TWO AND WILL PUT USE A LOT OF GFS GUIDANCE 
INFLUENCE TODAY. MAY NEED TO UPDATE PUBLIC ZONES TO LOWER 
WINDS...BUT WILL WAIT FOR FULL MIXING BEFORE DOING SO. CURRENTLY 
THINKING ABOUT SHAVING WINDS TO 10 TO 15 MPH.
&&

.AVIATION...
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND WIDELY SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS WELL 
AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR VIS AND/OR 
CIGS WILL ACCOMPANY THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS. WIND GUSTS AROUND 30 
KNOTS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE STRONGEST CELLS. OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION 
AND BOUNDARIES...SURFACE WINDS WILL AVERAGE 100/8-12KTS. 

&&

.MARINE...
NO MORNING QUIKSCAT PASS TO ESTIMATE SURFACE WINDS IN THE OUTER 
STRAITS. NORTHERN EXTENT OF WINDS EXCEEDING 15 KNOTS SEEN NEAR 
ANDROS ISLAND YESTERDAY MORNING HAS NOT SPREAD INTO THE STRAITS WITH 
BEST PRESSURE GRADIENT CONFINED TO THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN. WILL 
REMOVE THE CAUTION AND BRING WINDS DOWN TO 15 KNOTS. MAY SHAVE GULF 
AND FLORIDA BAY WATERS TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS IF 1400Z CMAN OBSERVATIONS 
DONT PICK UP. MARINERS SHOULD STILL KEEP CLOSE WATCH FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS WHICH MAY CONTAIN WIND GUSTS EXCEEDING 30 KNOTS. 
SEVERAL STORMS THIS MORNING HAVE ALSO BEEN VERY PROLIFIC LIGHTNING 
PRODUCERS.

345 AM EDT SUN JUL 2 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SATELLITE AND SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATE THAT THE TROUGH AXIS/WK WAVE 
IS STRETCHED ACROSS THE WESTERN EXTENT OF THE SERVICE AREA THIS 
MORNING. MODERATE TO PERIODICALLY FRESH WINDS HAVE DIPPED SLIGHTLY 
TO THE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE WESTERN WATERS WHILE THE EASTERN ZONES 
HAVE BACKED SEVERAL DEGREES OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. KBYX RADAR HAS 
SHOWN AN INCREASE OF SHOWERS WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS INCREASING 
IN AREA FROM THE OUTER STRAITS ACROSS THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS AND 
INTO THE GULF WATERS. IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES 
EXTENDING FROM THE LOWER KEYS OFF TO THE NORTHEAST...WHILE PARTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES ARE IN AN AREA FROM KEY WEST SOUTHWESTWARD TO THE CUBAN 
COAST.

.FORECAST...
PLENTY OF LOWER BOUNDARIES CAN BE PICKED OUT IN THE EASTERN EXTENT 
OF THE FLORIDA STRAITS THIS MORNING. MOISTURE ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE EXITING WAVE SETS THE AREA FOR HIGHER THAN AVERAGE RAIN CHANCES 
TODAY. ALTHOUGH THE SHORT RANGE NUMBERS OF THE NAM...AND MORESO THE 
GFS...KBYX RADAR LOOP SUPPORTS STAYING CLOSE TO THE LIKELY POPS WE 
HAVE ADVERTISED. THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS QUITE MOIST ON DEEP EAST 
FLOW THROUGH THIS EVENING AND EARLY MONDAY MORNING WHEN THE FLOW 
ALOFT SLACKENS. THEN IS A SLIGHTLY DRIER STACK OF AIR BETWEEN 5 AND 
10 KFT SLIDES IN TO THE LOCAL AREA...ALLOWING FOR POPS TO DROP BACK 
TO A CHANCE. HIGH SURFACE PRESSURE ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA THEN BEGINS 
TO WEAKEN AND EASE FURTHER SOUTH DURING THE UPCOMING WEEK LEADING TO 
A MORE RELAXED AND VEERED WIND FIELD. NO CHANGE TO THE EXTENDED 
PERIODS OF THE FORECAST WITH CHANCE POPS AND TEMPERATURES RIDING A 
FEW DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE. WIND-WISE...GUIDANCE HAS NOT BEEN 
CONSISTENT OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS AS FAR AS SPEEDS ARE CONCERNED. 
GFS IS INDICATING SURFACE WINDS A GOOD 5 KNOTS BELOW YESTERDAYS 
OUTPUT THROUGH EARLY MONDAY MORNING...OVERLAYED BY A STEADY MODERATE 
FLOW. NAM HAS RATCHETED UP THE WINDS ANOTHER 2 TO 3 KNOTS FOR THE 
SAME PERIOD. CURRENT CONVECTION IS DISTURBING THE CMANS THIS 
MORNING...BUT THE NAM LOOKS A LITTLE HIGH RIGHT OFF THE BAT. 
SO...WILL ONLY MAKE SOME SUBTLE WIND SPEED ADJUSTMENTS IN THE GRIDS 
FOR THE SHORT TERM...BUT THIS WILL AMOUNT TO LITTLE IF ANY CHANGE IN 
THE UPCOMING ZONE FORECAST.

&&

.MARINE...
SHORT RANGE MARINE FORECAST ALSO LOOKS FINE...WITH AN EXERCISE 
CAUTION HEADLINE FOR SMALL CRAFT MAINTAINED IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS 
TODAY AND TONIGHT. WILL NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT...BUT LATEST GUIDANCES SHOWS A PERIOD OF MORE RELAXED WINDS 
ACROSS MOST OF THE WATERS. WILL LET THE NEXT SHIFT SEE IF THIS TREND 
REPLAYS ITSELF IN LATER RUNS FOR THE KEYS WATERS. BUT THE MIDDLE TO 
LATE PARTS OF THE WEEK WILL HAVE MORE RELAXED CONDITIONS.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...ON THE MAINLAND...KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE WILL BE ON THE EAST 
SIDE OF A WESTWARD MIGRATING TROPICAL WAVE. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE ON THE MAINLAND THIS MORNING...BECOMING 
NUMEROUS THIS AFTERNOON. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE WATER PORTION(60SW KMIA-KEYW) 
AND THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS THROUGH 16Z...BECOMING 
NUMEROUS SHOWERS WITH WIDELY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. THESE SHOWERS 
AND STORMS WILL BECOME NUMEROUS DURING THE AFTERNOON. ISOLATED WIND 
GUSTS OVER 30 KNOTS ARE LIKELY IN THE STRONGEST CELLS. PERIODIC 
MVFR/IFR CEILINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITH THE HEAVIEST SHOWERS AND STORMS. 
STORM MOTION WILL BE GENERALLY TOWARD THE NORTHWEST...020-140 AT 
15KT...WITH MAX TOPS TO FL450.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
BOTH THE KBYX AND KAMX VWP REVEAL A SUBTLE WEAK TROPICAL WAVE AXIS 
EXTENDING FROM THE SPINE OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA SOUTHWARD INTO OUR 
AREA. BEHIND THE MINOR UNDULATION...AN ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE 
ACCOMPANIED BY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
CONTINUES TO MIGRATE WEST SOUTHWEST FROM THE BAHAMAS INTO OUR 
EASTERN STRAITS AND UPPER KEYS. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN 
STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE MOSTLY EAST WINDS OF AROUND 15 KNOTS WITH 
GUSTS OF 20 TO 25 KNOTS NEAR OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES AND THE STRONGER 
ACTIVITY. OTHERWISE...OUR EVENING SOUNDING REVEALS AN EXTREMELY 
MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS...WITH A FAIRLY DEEP EASTERLY 
FLOW REACHING UP TO 700 MB BUT WITH A RATHER WARM 500 MB TEMPERATURE 
OF ONLY -5.7 DEGREES C. 

.FORECAST...
WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE IN PLACE...THE COMBINATION OF LOW 
LEVEL CONFLUENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEARBY PERTURBATION AND 
NOCTURNAL ENHANCEMENT SUPPORTS THE SOLID 50 PERCENT POPS OVERNIGHT. 
WITH THE INDIVIDUAL SHOWERS AND STORMS MOVING FAIRLY QUICKLY NEAR 15 
KNOTS...OVERALL RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD REMAIN AT A HALF OF AN INCH 
OR LESS...BUT TEMPERATURES COULD DROP INTO THE MID AND UPPER 70S 
WITHIN THE LOCALLY HEAVY DOWNPOURS. SINCE FORECAST SENSIBLE ELEMENTS 
APPEAR ON TRACK...NO ADJUSTMENTS ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME. 

&&

.MARINE...
OUR EVENING RAWINDSONDE DEPICTS EAST WINDS OF 17 AND 16 KNOTS AT 1

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
330 PM EDT SAT JUL 1 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A BIT UNSETTLED THIS AFTERNOON AS KBYX RADAR INDICATES SEVERAL SMALL 
CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PROPAGATING IN SYNCHRONIZATION 
WITH SHORT OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES. AS OF 1845Z THE SHOWERS WERE MOST 
PREVALENT FROM OFFSHORE LONG KEY THROUGH MARATHON/SEVEN MILE BRIDGE 
AND EMERGING OUT INTO THE GULF WITHIN 20NM OF THE LOWER KEYS. OTHER 
CLUSTERS HAVE BEEN BRIEFLY VIGOROUS BEYOND 50NM OFFSHORE THE MIDDLE 
AND UPPER KEYS. EAST WINDS HAVE FRESHENED TO AROUND 15 MPH WITH 
GUSTS ABOVE 20 MPH...WITH GUSTS IN THE SHOWERS EXCEEDING 25 KNOTS AT 
TIMES. TEMPERATURES ACTUALLY PEAKED AT 89F AT KEY WEST...BUT NEARBY 
SHOWERS AND INCREASING CONVECTIVE DEBRIS HAS DROPPED TEMPERATURES 
INTO THE MID 80S. DEWPOINTS HAVE INCREASED INTO THE MID 70S. 
DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 70S LURK ALONG COASTAL SECTIONS OF CUBA AND 
IN THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS.

.FORECAST...
THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC STORY IS TOLD BY A STRONG MID TO UPPER RIDGE 
ACROSS THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN...WITH A VERY POSITIVE TILT SHORTWAVE 
THROUGH THE EASTERN SEABOARD. OVER TIME...THE SOUTHERN END OF THE 
UPPER TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO BE LEFT BEHIND OFF THE GEORGIA COAST AND 
POSSIBLE CUT OFF. LATE IN THE WEEK MORE ENERGY SINKS INTO THE MID 
ATLANTIC AND BOOTS OUT THE WEAKNESS. WHILE THE UPPER HIGH SLIPS WEST 
TOWARD THE SOUTHERN GULF LATE IN THE WEEK...NO SIGNIFICANT UPPER 
FEATURES ARE EXPECTED TO RETROGRADE THROUGH THE KEYS. BELOW...A 
SURFACE RIDGE HAS BEEN STRENGTHENING ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST U.S. THE 
NORTHERN EXTENSION OF A TROPICAL WAVE REACHES NORTHEAST THROUGH THE 
NORTHWEST BAHAMAS. ONLY THE NORTHERN PORTION IS ACTIVE AS IT 
INTERACTS WITH STRONGER WESTERLIES...GOOD VENTILATION FOR 
CONVECTION. THE TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAVE IS NOT VERY WELL 
DEFINED IN TERMS OF ISOBARS...AND IT MAINLY HERALDS INCREASED EAST 
TO SOUTHEAST FLOW IN THE LOW ALTITUDES CONTRIBUTING TO BETTER 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND ARRIVAL OF HIGHER THETA-E ATMOSPHERE. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER IS EXPECTED CLIMB HIGHER TO NEAR 2.2 INCHES PER 
GFS AND NAM MODEL SOUNDINGS BY SUNDAY. THERE IS SOME 
DIVERGENCE...BUT NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG...FAVORING BEST LIFT ACROSS 
THE EASTERN WATERS THROUGH THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. DIFFERENCES ARISE 
IN THE MORE AGGRESSIVE AND CONCENTRATED NAM VS THE MORE OPEN GFS 
SOLUTION. GFS MOS POPS HAVE DROPPED WHILE NAM POPS HAVE SKYROCKETED. 
WITH THE INCREASED MOISTURE...CONVERGENCE FROM NUMEROUS MESOSCALE 
BOUNDARIES IN ADDITION TO THE BROADER CONVERGENCE WITH THE 
TROUGH...AND SLIGHT TURNING OF WINDS TO SOUTHEAST BELOW 15000 
FEET...EXPECTING GREATER COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. IN 
THE WAKE OF THE SURFACE TROUGH PASSAGE...RIDGE TO THE NORTH WILL 
KEEP THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHT ENOUGH FOR MODERATE EAST WINDS 
UNTIL MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. THEREAFTER THE WEST ATLANTIC RIDGE 
WEAKENS DUE TO THE LATE WEEK UPPER TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE 
NORTHEAST...AND THE WEAKENED RIDGE AXIS SLIPS BACK DOWN THE 
PENINSULA. 

FOR TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...BOOSTED POPS TO HIGH CHANCE 
TONIGHT AND LIKELY FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE MAXIMUM 
CONVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE TROUGH MOVES INTO THE AREA. 
EXPECT GUSTY WINDS NEAR 15 MPH. WHILE THE DOWNPOURS MAY OCCUR 
SEVERAL TIMES...FAST MOVEMENT OF THE SHOWERS WILL KEEP RAINFALL 
TOTALS IN CHECK. KEPT THE TOTAL 24-HR QPF FOR MONDAY BELOW ONE HALF 
INCH FOR A KEYS AVERAGE. 

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...WINDS WILL GRADUALLY SLACKEN AND 
BECOME MORE SOUTHEASTERLY. MOIST AIRMASS WILL CONTINUE...BUT LACK OF 
SIGNIFICANT SYNOPTIC PRECLUDE THE LIKELY POPS THAT MOS GUIDANCE HAS 
PROJECTED. JUST KNOW THE DRYING PROCESS WILL BE SLOW WITH THE LIGHT 
SOUTHEAST WINDS.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...MAINTAINED CLIMATOLOGICAL POPS NEAR 30 
PERCENT AND NORMAL SUMMERTIME WEATHER. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT OUT OF 
THE SOUTHEAST AS THE SURFACE RIDGE AXIS WEAKENS AND SINKS THROUGH 
THE FLORIDA PENINSULA.
&&

.MARINE...
MARINERS SHOULD CHECK THE WEATHER PRIOR TO DEPARTURE AND CHECK WITH 
NOAA WEATHER RADIO DUE TO INCREASING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE 
TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING. THE MAIN IMPACTS FROM THE STRONGER 
STORMS WILL BE BRIEFLY VERY POOR VISIBILITY AND FREQUENT DANGEROUS 
LIGHTNING STRIKES. A FEW MAY PRODUCE WIND GUSTS TO 35 KNOTS AS WELL.0
THE PRESSURE GRADIENT DUE TO THE APPROACHING SURFACE TROUGH FROM THE 
EAST AND A STRENGTHENING RIDGE TO THE NORTH...ALONG WITH THE 
GUSTINESS FROM COOL OUTFLOW FROM NUMEROUS SHOWERS...WILL MAKE IT A 
BIT DICEY ON THE STRAITS THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. RECOMMENDING SMALL 
CRAFT EXERCISE CAUTION AS WINDS EXPECTED TO EXCEED 15 KNOTS WITH 
FREQUENT GUSTS ABOVE 20 KNOTS. SEAS WILL BUILD TO 6 FEET...EVEN 
HIGHER IN THE GULF STREAM...FROM EARLY SUNDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. 
THEREAFTER SLACKENING OF THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL ALLOW THE EAST 
WINDS TO DROP TO 15 KNOTS OR LESS MONDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
WORK WEEK. 
&&

.AVIATION...
THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT...INITIALLY WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR SHOWERS 
AND ISOLATED IFR THUNDERSTORMS WILL DECREASE TO ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE. SHOWER AND 
STORM MOTION WILL GENERALLY BE TOWARDS THE WEST AT AROUND 20 KNOTS. 
WINDS UNDER THIS FAST MOVING ACTIVITY WILL EASILY GUST TO 25 OR 30 
KNOTS. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM DISTURBED WEATHER WILL GENERALLY BE 
EASTERLY AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
SURFACE WINDS ARE BEGINNING TO FRESHEN ALONG THE REEF WITH SURFACE 
SPEEDS INCREASING ON PACE WITH MOS GUIDANCE...AROUND 12 TO 15 KNOTS 
FROM SOMBRERO KEY ON UP THROUGH THE UPPER KEYS. SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS 
THE WEST ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEAST STATES HAS STRENGTHENED AROUND 3 MB 
SINCE SAME TIME YESTERDAY ALLOWING THE EAST FLOW TO INCREASE. 
QUIKSCAT SATELLITE WINDS INDICATE 15 TO 20 KNOTS SOUTHEAST OF ANDROS 
ISLAND AROUND 1030Z. NORTHERN EXTENSION OF A WEAK LOW ALTITUDE 
TROUGH CURRENTLY MOVING WEST THROUGH THE BAHAMAS. MORNING SOUNDING 
INDICATED EAST FLOW OFF THE DECK WITH LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS UP TO 
15K FEET...COINCIDENT WITH HIGH MOISTURE. PRECIPITABLE WATERS HAVE 
INDEED RESPONDED TO THIS DEEPER SOUTHEAST FLOW AND ARE RUNNING 
AROUND 2 INCHES. CURRENT SBCAPES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE CLIMBING PAST 
3200 J/KG AT KEYW AT THIS TIME. IN ADVANCE OF THE TROUGH 
AXIS...SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE CONTINUED ACROSS THE STRAITS MAINLY 
BEYOND 15NM OFFSHORE THE ISLAND CHAIN...WITH LINGERING ACTIVITY 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CONVERGENCE BETWEEN THE EASTERLIES AND THE WEST 
FLORIDA LANDBREEZE. ISOLATED THUNDER WAS NOTED...WITH SOME TOPS IN 
EXCESS OF 50K FEET NOTED IN THE FAR OUTER STRAITS OFF KEY LARGO.

.FORECAST...
EXPECT MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING TROUGH TO 
CONTINUE SCATTERED COVERAGE IN THE STRAITS. EAST WINDS WILL FRESHEN. 
THE INCREASE EAST WINDS WILL MITIGATE STRONG ISLAND 
CONVERGENCE...ALTHOUGH LONG STREETS OF LEESIDE CONVERGENCE AND SOME 
TCU TIED TO THE LARGER LOWER KEYS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE GULFSIDE. 
MOST OF THE SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE STRAITS WILL REMAIN IN THE 
STRAITS THROUGH MIDDAY...BUT THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS WILL HAVE THE 
BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN THIS AFTERNOON. CURRENT CHANCE POPS ARE GOOD 
AND BUT MAY NEED TO BOOST TO 50 PERCENT LATE MORNING IF CURRENT 
ACTIVITY OVER THE STRAITS ENCROACHES UPON THE REEF BEFORE NOON.
&&

.AVIATION...
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED IFR THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. MOST OF 
THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE PUSHED TO THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE ROUTE OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA DUE TO A 10 TO 15 KNOT STEERING FLOW. OVER THE KEYS 
HALF OF THE ROUTE...ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE 
ANTICIPATED. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM CONVECTIVELY DISTURBED WEATHER 
WILL BE MAINLY EASTERLY AT AROUND 10 KNOTS.
&&

.MARINE...
EAST WINDS WILL INCREASE TO NEAR 15 KNOTS AND MAY BE 
GUSTY...ESPECIALLY NEAR THE STRONGER SHOWERS. SOME THUNDERSTORMS 
WERE NOTED IN THE STRAITS OFF THE UPPER KEYS THIS MORNING...SO WILL 
BOOST COVERAGE OF THUNDER IN THE STRAITS FOR THIS AFTERNOON. EAST 
WINDS WILL BOOST SEAS TO 3 TO 5 FEET WITH HIGHER WAVES FROM TIME TO 
TIME IN THE GULF STREAM. OTHERWISE BOATERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF LESS 
THAN IDEAL BOATING WEATHER IN THE STRAITS TODAY...TONIGHT...AND 
LIKELY LASTING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. NO FLAGS TO BE HOISTED AT THIS

A FEW SUBTLE BOUNDARIES ARE SEEN ON SATELLITE THIS MORNING...KICKING 
OFF SCATTERED SHOWERS. ONE GROUPING IS ON THE WESTERN REACHES OF OUR 
GULF ZONES...AND ANOTHER IS IN THE ATLANTIC WATERS ADJACENT TO THE

MPH. WINDS ARE MODERATE OUT OF THE EAST. TEMPERATURES ARE LOWER TO 
MID 80S AL9ONG THE ISLANDS...AND AWAY FROM THE SMALL SHOWERS...SKIES 
ARE PARTLY CLOUDY.

.FORECAST...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED FROM THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA. THIS AREA WILL STRENGTHEN A LITTLE MORE AND 
REMAIN ALIGNED CLOSE TO ITS PRESENT POSITION THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE LOCAL GRADIENT WILL SUPPORT MODERATE 
BREEZES...POSSIBLY FRESH AT TIME SUNDAY MORNING THROUGH EARLY 
EVENING. A WEAK SECTION OF A SURFACE WAVE WILL BE PULLED ACROSS THE 
LOCAL AREA AT THIS TIME...AND THE GFS NOW HAS A MORE DEFINED 
DEPICTION OF THIS FEATURE THAN AT THIS TIME YESTERDAY. BUT IT IS 
STILL QUITE SUBTLE. NONETHELESS...HAVE ADDED A FEW TICKS TO WIND 
SPEEDS IN THE GRIDS AT THIS TIME...AND HAVE COME BACK UP ON THE POPS 
FOR BOTH SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AS HIGHER MOISTURE GETS DRAGGED 
OVER THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. AT THIS TIME...WILL KEEP IT ON 
THE HIGH END OF CHANCE EVEN WITH THE GFS IS GOING WELL INTO THE 
LIKELY RANGE ON ITS 12 HOUR NUMBERS. LATEST EXTENDED MOS IS PUSHING 
CATEGORICAL FROM LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY EVEN. THE DEEP EASTERLY 
FLOW THEN VEERS AND SLACKENS FROM LATE MONDAY THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
COMING WEEK. GFS PULLS ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT SLUG OF MOISTURE ACROSS 
THE KEYS LATE NEXT WEEK AS THE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE AXIS SETTLES 
FURTHER SOUTHWARD. WILL KEEP THE LATE PERIODS OF THE FORECAST ONLY 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMO POPS.

&&

KNOTS...ESPECIALLY OUT IN THE STRAITS...BUT AT THIS TIME WILL KEEP 
THE NUMERICAL LIMT AT 15 KNOTS AND KEEP THE GUSTY DESCRIPTOR. 
BOATERS SHOULD KEEP THESE POTENTIALLY HIGHER CONDITIONS IN MIND WHEN

.CURRENTLY...
LATE MORNING THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS SAW TCUS AND A FEW CBS 
FORM IN LINES DIRECTLY OVER THE KEYS...INCLUDING UPPER, MIDDLE, AND 
LOWER KEYS. SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS RESULTED OVER SCATTERED 
ISLAND LOCATIONS...BEFORE RAINING OUT. SURFACE WINDS ARE NO LONGER 
PARALLEL TO UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS ISLANDS...BUT HAVE TURNED CLOSER 
TO DUE EAST THE PAST FEW HOURS...AND THEREFORE CURRENTLY NOT MUCH 
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT IS SEEN NEAR THOSE ISLANDS. THE NEARLY-EAST FLOW 
HOWEVER HAS LEAD TO A SECOND FORMATION OF BUILDING CUMULUS OVER THE 
LOWER KEYS. MEANWHILE...CONVECTION HAS FLOURISHED OVER THE SOUTH 
FLORIDA MAINLAND WITH LARGE CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MOVING INTO THE SOUTHWEST PORTION OF THE PENINSULA. MIAMI DOPPLER 
RADAR WIND PROFILE INDICATES A FLOW FROM THE EAST SURFACE UP TO 4 
THSD FT...FROM THE NE TENDING TO N FROM 5 THSD FT TO 12 THSD FT 
AGL...GENERALLY AT SPEEDS OF 10 KT OR LESS. THIS FLOW SHOULD PUSH 
MAINLAND CONVECTION SLOWLY TOWARD THE SW...BUT A TURN OF WINDS MAY 
TEND TO PUSH THINGS MORE LIKE WSW LATER THIS EVENING. FAR TO OUR 
EAST...A VERY LARGE CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS IS SEEN ON SATELLITE 
EAST OF THE SOUTHEAST BAHAMAS. THIS AREA IS PARTLY ASSOCIATED WITH A 
WEAK SURFACE TROPICAL WAVE...BUT MORE SUBSTANTIALLY DUE TO A LIFT 
REGION JUST EAST OF A MID TO HIGH LEVEL TROUGH (500-250 MB).

.FORECAST...
TONIGHT...LINGERING TCU LINES...MAINLY OVER THE LOWER KEYS IN AN 
EAST OR EAST-NORTHEAST LOWER LEVEL FLOW...OUGHT TO GIVE SOME 
ADDITIONAL SHOWERS TO THE LOWER KEYS THIS EVENING. THE CONVECTION 
OVER THE SOUTHERN MAINLAND SHOULD TRACK SW FOR A WHILE...MAY OR MAY 
NOT RAIN OUT QUICKLY...BUT DOES HAVE THE POTENTIAL FOR FLINGING OUT 
SOME BOUNDARIES TOWARD THE KEYS THIS EVENING WHICH MAY ENHANCE OR 
LEAD TO SHOWER DEVELOPMENT NEAR OR OVER ANY OF THE KEYS. I WILL KEEP 
THE CURRENT 40 PCT POPS IN THE FORECAST DESPITE MOS NUMBERS ALL 
AROUND 30 PCT. THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH IS STILL 
EXPECTED TO EXPAND A BIT TONIGHT...AND MAY BUMP UP LOCAL WIND FLOW 
FROM THE ENE INTO THE 10-15 MPH RANGE...15 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS. 
THERE IS SOME POSSIBILITY OF NOCTURNAL SHOWERS LATER ON TONIGHT 
MOVING OFF THE STRAITS INTO THE KEYS DUE TO THE FRESHER WINDS... OR 
THINGS MAY JUST WIND DOWN.  

SATURDAY-SUNDAY NIGHT...THE NORTHERN EXTENSION OF A WEAK TROPICAL 
WAVE IS SEEN IN MODELS TO MOVE WEST OVER THE KEYS AND SOUTH FLORIDA 
WITHIN THE TIME FRAME SOMEWHERE FROM LATE SATURDAY TO SUNDAY. THE 
GFS CURRENTLY APPEARS REASONABLE WITH THIS FEATURE...SHOWING A 
SATURDAY EVENING INTO SATURDAY NIGHT PASSAGE OF THE WEAK WAVE AXIS. 
MODELS INDICATE THAT THE PORTION OF THE WAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
STRONG THUNDERSTORMS NOW EAST OF THE SOUTHERN BAHAMAS WILL DRIFT NW 
INTO THE OPEN ATLANTIC WELL EAST OF FLORIDA...BECAUSE THE 
ACCOMPANYING MID TO HIGH LEVEL TROUGH LIFTS NORTH WHILE REMAINING 
EAST OF THE BAHAMAS. MEANWHILE...THE WEAK, LOW AMPLITUDE LOWER LEVEL 
REFLECTION OF THE WAVE SHOULD TRACK WEST TOWARD THE KEYS AND THE 
CARIBBEAN. THE GFS MODEL MAINTAINS 40-50 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR EACH 
PERIOD SAT THROUGH SUN NIGHT...AND FORECASTS SIMILARLY WILL FOLLOW 
THIS. THE NAM MODEL IS SLOWER TO MOVE THE WAVE WEST.

 GFS STILL SHOWS A MODEST AREA OF LIFT SAT NIGHT AND SUN WITH AND 
JUST BEHIND THE WAVE PASSAGE...AND THIS ALONG WITH HIGH MOISTURE 
CONTENT AND SOME FRESHENING OF EAST WINDS MAY PROMPT SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
CHANCES OF RAIN...BUT ILL WAIT TO SEE SUBSEQUENT MODEL RUNS. THOSE 
SURFACE WINDS SHOULD PREDOMINATE FROM THE EAST...MAYBE NEAR 15 MPH 
AT TIMES OVER THE KEYS...DUE MAINLY TO THE HIGHER PRESSURE TO OUR 
NORTH BUT ALSO DUE TO THE WAVE PASSAGE THROUGH THE CARIBBEAN. 

MONDAY-TUESDAY NIGHT...MOIST AIR FROM THE SURFACE TO ABOVE 10 THSD 
FT...AND A MODERATE EASTERLY FLOW IN THE SAME LEVELS...MAY BRING 
NOCTURNAL SHOWERS OVER THE KEYS AS WELL AS PERHAPS CREATE SOME CLOUD 
LINES OFF THE BAHAMA ISLANDS WITH SHOWERS. 30 PCT POPS ARE CARRIED. 

WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY...THE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH SHOULD WEAKEN SLOWLY 
ALLOWING SURFACE FLOW TO DECREASE AND TURN TO SE. EXTENDED MODELS 
ALSO SHOW A DEEP LAYER FLOW FROM THE SE TO S SETTING IN. THIS 
PATTERN MAY CREATE SOME THREAT OF LATE DAY AND EVENING ENHANCED 
SHOWER THREAT DUE TO MIGRATION FROM CUBA. ITS TOO SOON AND TOO 
VAGUE AT THIS POINT.

TODAY...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MARINE PORTION

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
WIND FLOW OVER THE KEYS THIS MORNING HAS BEEN FROM THE NORTH AND 
NORTHEAST AT LIGHTER SPEEDS THAN MODEL OUTPUT HAD INDICATED. THIS 
MAY BE DUE TO A SPLIT IN THE WESTERN END OF THE ATLANTIC RIDGE...
ALLOWING A GULF OF MEXICO HIGH PRESSURE CELL TO EXTEND FARTHER INTO 
FLORIDA AND THEREBY DRIVE KEYS WINDS TEMPORARILY THIS MORNING. THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS IS JUST NORTH OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. OUR 
SOUNDING THIS MORNING SHOWED EAST WINDS ABOUT 10 KT ABOVE THE 
GROUND...FROM 3 THSD TO 12 THSD FT AGL. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALREADY ONGOING...SPOTTED AROUND THE KEYS AND 
WATERS. THERE SEEMS TO BE A LAND BREEZE THAT PUSHED OFF MAINLAND 
FLORIDA...AND IS NOW CURVING FROM 20 NM OFF SW FLORIDA...OVER TO BIG 
PINE KEY...THEN SOUTH OF MARATHON. 

.FORECAST...
THE OPERATIONAL MODELS ALL INDICATE A TURN OF WINDS TO EAST BY END 
OF THE DAY...BUT TRANSITIONING THROUGH NE FOR A WHILE THIS 
AFTERNOON. PLENTIFUL MOISTURE IS IN PLACE...AND WITH A RATHER 
FAVORABLE LOW LEVEL WIND PROFILE...THEN ADDITIONAL TCU AND CB 
DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED OVER AND/OR NEAR KEYS ISLANDS THIS AFTERNOON.
40 PCT POPS SEEM FINE...AND NO UPDATED TO PUBLIC ZONES IS PLANNED.

INCREASE WIND SPEEDS AS WELL TO 10-15 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS...NEAR 
10 KT FOR BAY AND GULF WATERS. WATCH FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
BECOMING MORE CONCENTRATED NEAR ISLANDS THIS AFTERNOON...AND

AFTER AN ACTIVE EVENING...SATELLITE SHOWS MINIMAL CLOUDS AND KBYX 
HAS HAD ONLY THE SMALLEST OF ECHOES ON THE SOUTHWESTERN EXTREME OUR 
SERVICE AREA THIS MORNING. MORE RECENT ECHOES HAVE QUICKLY FORMED IN 
THE WATERS ADJACENT TO THE UPPER KEYS. WINDS ARE LIGHT TO MODERATE 
OUT OF THE EAST ACROSS MOST OF THE MARINE ZONES. TEMPERATURES HAVE 
RECOVERED TO BE IN THE LOWER 80S ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN.

.FORECAST...
THE MID LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE BAHAMAS CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND LIFT 
OUT OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO...ALLOWING DEEP RIDGING TO BECOME 
ALIGNED TO OUR NORTH. RESULTANT FLOW BECOMES RATHER DEEP OUT OF THE 
EAST. THE WAVE CURRENTLY REACHING TO THE NORTH OF THE LESSER 
ANTILLES IS STILL EXPECTED TO POOL HIGHER MOISTURE VALUES TOWARDS 
THE FLORIDA STRAITS AND KEYS SATURDAY THROUGH EARLY 
SUNDAY...ALTHOUGH THE SHORT RANGE GUIDANCE IS SHOWING A SPLITTING OF 
ENERGY OFF TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE IMMEDIATE AREA AS EARLY AS THIS 
AFTERNOON. GUIDANCE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT AND IS IN AGREEMENT WITH 
HIGHER EASTERLY WINDS...FROM THIS EVENING ALL THE WAY INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...WITH THE STRENGTHENED ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE AXIS 
ALIGNED ACROSS NORTHERN FLORIDA. LOCAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY WILL BE MOSTLY DRIVEN BY SMALL SCALE BOUNDARY 
INTERACTIONS CROSSING THE STRAITS. BACKED WINDS INTO EARLY THIS 
AFTERNOON WILL A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF CLOUD LINES AND ASSOCIATED 
SHOWERS ALONG THE KEYS. SO WILL KEEP OUR RAIN CHANCES AT 40 
PERCENT...WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE GFS NUMBERS IN THE SHORT 
TERM. BESIDES A MINOR DOWNWARD TWEAK IN POPS FOR SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT...DUE MAINLY TO LACK OF DISCERNABLE TRANSIENT FORCING 
FEATURE IN SPITE OF SOME POOLING MOISTURE NEARBY...NO OTHER CHANGES 
WILL BE INCORPORATED TO THE GRIDS THIS MORNING. THAT SAID...A FAIR 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MAINTAINED THIS WEEKEND 
ALL THE WAY THROUGH NEXT WEEK. A SLOW INCREASE IN WINDS IS EXPECTED 
THROUGH TODAY. MORE STEADY EAST WINDS NEAR 15 MPH IS EXPECTED 
SATURDAY AND AGAIN ON SUNDAY.

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE EAST BREEZES MAY BE BACKED VERY SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTHEAST 
EARLY TODAY. BE ON THE WATCH FOR LIGHTNING AND POSSIBLY A FEW

WINDS CLOSER TO 15 KNOTS. GFS IS SHOWING ABOUT A 6 HR PERIOD CLOSER 
TO 20 KNOTS LATE SUNDAY EVENING...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE STRAITS. BUT 
AT THIS TIME I WILL HOLD THE GRIDDED NUMBERS CLOSER TO 15 KNOTS.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. ISOLATED SHOWERS 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TWEB ROUTE THIS MORNING...WITH SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER THE MAINLAND 
LATER IN THE MORNING(AFTER 15Z). SURFACE TO 20000 FOOT WINDS WILL 
AVERAGE 060 DEGREES BETWEEN 6 AND 8 KNOTS OVER THE ISLAND TERMINALS 
DURING THE DAY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR CUMULUS/TCU LINES NEAR THE KEYW 
AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. A CUMULUS LINE IS MORE LIKELY AT THE KEYW

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A COUPLE OF SHIP REPORTS JUST NORTH AND EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS 
SUGGEST THAT THE WEAK SURFACE RIDGE AXIS STILL EXTENDS WEST NEAR 
GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND TO PALM BEACH. MEANWHILE...SEA BREEZE 
CIRCULATIONS HAVE SET IN ALL AROUND THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA
WITH CONVECTION LIKEWISE AROUND ALL COAST LINES. THE ATLANTIC COAST 
AND FLORIDA BAY COAST CURRENTLY HAVE THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE DUE TO OPPOSING SEA BREEZE AND PRESSURE 
GRADIENT. THERE HAS BEEN A SLIGHT DRIFT OF INDIVIDUAL TALL CELLS 
TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST. SURFACE WINDS FROM THE EAST-NORTHEAST 10 KT OR 
LESS HAVE PREVAILED ON KEYS ISLAND AND REEF SITES...PROMPTING SOME 
WELL DEVELOPED TCU/CB LINES OVER THE ISLANDS AND NEARSHORE WATERS. 
SO FAR ACTUAL SHOWERS HAVE BEEN LIMITED TO LOWER KEYS LOCATIONS. 
THE DEWPOINT AT KEY WEST CREPT UP TO STEAMY 76F FOR A WHILE THIS 
AFTERNOON. 

.FORECAST...
MAINLY MESOSCALE TRIGGERS FOR SHOWER INITIATION ARE SEEN FOR TONIGHT 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. THE GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT A WEAK TROPICAL  
WAVES NORTHERN EXTENSION MAY BRUSH THE KEYS SOMETIME DURING THE 
TIME FRAME SATURDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH A SOME PERIODS OF 
SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT ALONG AND WELL BEHIND THE WAVE WHICH WOULD TEND 
TO ENHANCE SHOWER ACTIVITY A BIT. MOST MODELS SHOW SOME INCREASE IN 
OVERALL EASTERLY WIND SPEEDS IN LOWER LEVELS DUE TO PASSAGE OF THE 
WAVE NEAR OR TO OUR SOUTH IN COMBINATION WITH INCREASE IN HIGH 
PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH STARTING FRIDAY NIGHT OR SATURDAY AND 
PERSISTING INTO NEXT WEEK. 

TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...A LOW LEVEL WIND DIRECTION FROM THE 
EAST-NORTHEAST DURING AFTERNOONS IS INDICATED...WHICH WOULD AGAIN 
FAVOR OVER-ISLAND TCU/CB DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION...TONIGHT AND 
FRIDAY EVENING...DEEP LAYER STEERING FLOW WOULD SEEM TO DRIVE 
MAINLAND SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST...OR AT 
LEAST MAY AID IN SENDING THEIR OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES TOWARD THE 
SOUTHWEST. GUIDANCE ALL INDICATE 30 PCT POPS FOR TONIGHT. I WILL 
HOLD TO ALREADY FORECASTED 40 PCT...BUT INDICATE A LATE NIGHT TREND 
TO LESSER SHOWER THREAT...BUT THIS MAY BE QUITE LATE IF SECONDARY 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IS SET OFF BY MAINLAND OUTFLOWS. WINDS ARE 
EXPECTED TO INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT IN RESPONSE TO THE HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE SHIFTING FARTHER NORTH...AND INCREASING IN STRENGTH. 

SATURDAY-SATURDAY NIGHT...MODELS ALL HAVE 50 PCT POPS FOR 
SAT...WHICH IS CONSISTENT WITH ONGOING FORECASTS...AND I WILL HOLD 
ONTO 50 PCT FOR SAT NIGHT AS WELL. TIMING OF THE TROPICAL WAVE 
PASSAGE EITHER NEAR OR JUST SOUTH OF THE KEYS IS IN QUESTION...
BUT THE GFS MODEL INDICATES A VERY SUBTLE SURFACE REFLECTION...
AND SLIGHT BETTER REFLECTION AT 850 MB...OF A TROPICAL WAVE OVER THE 
KEYS DURING THE DAY SAT WITH FOLLOWING LIFT AND HIGH MOISTURE 
CONTENT SAT NIGHT. LOWER LEVEL WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 15 MPH OR 
PERHAPS MORE. 

SUNDAY-SUNDAY NIGHT...EXTENDED GFS OUTPUT INDICATES A CONTINUED 
MODERATE EAST FLOW...AND SOME CONTINUING LARGE SCALE LIFT...AS
A MID LEVEL (700-500 MB)TROUGH LAGS BACK TO THE EAST OF THE WEAK 
SURFACE AND 850 MB WAVE POSITION. 40 PCT POPS WILL BE CONTINUED FOR 
SUNDAY AND EXTENDED INTO SUN NIGHT. THE NAM MODEL AGAIN HAS TO BE 
TAKEN WITH A GRAIN OF SALT...AS IT SHOWS THE WAVE FORMING INTO WEAK 
CLOSED LOW CENTER...AND MOVING QUITE A BIT SLOWER...TO BE OVER THE 
CENTRAL BAHAMAS SUNDAY. 

MONDAY-THURSDAY...LOWER LEVEL FLOW SHOULD STAY MODERATE AND TURN ESE 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY...PERHAPS DROPPING IN SPEEDS A BIT WED AND THU. 
CONTINUED DEEP LAYERED MOISTURE IS INDICATED...BUT PERHAPS WITH SOME 
LESSER DEEP LAYERED LIFT. 30 PCT POPS ARE RETAINED. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA SHOULD GIVE 
E OR ENE WINDS OVER KEYS WATERS TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY...5-10 KT LATER 
TONIGHT OVER FLORIDA BAY AND GULF WATERS...NEAR 10 KT OVER ATLANTIC 
WATERS. THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT FARTHER NORTH...
AND STRENGTHEN...WITH WINDS INCREASING TO NEAR 15 KT OVER ATLANTIC 
WATERS AND 10-15 KT OVER BAY AND GULF WATERS FRIDAY NIGHT...
CONTINUING THROUGH THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. IN ADDITION...

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS DEEP RIDGING 
ALOFT ABOVE 850MB...WITH WEAK EASTERLIES BELOW 850MB. A MODIFIED 
WEDNESDAY EVENING KEY WEST SOUNDING REVEALED A MOIST MIXED LAYER 
WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE STRATIFICATION AND LITTLE CONVECTIVE 
INHIBITION. LATEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS SHOW ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA WITH A MEAN CELL MOTION OF 
ABOUT 105/12KT. CURRENT AIR TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING IN THE MID 80S 
WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S. WINDS AT MARINE PLATFORMS ARE BLOWING 
FROM THE EAST NEAR 10KT...WITH SPEEDS NEAR 10MPH AT ISLAND STATIONS.

FORECAST:
BASIC PROGNOSTIC REASONING HAS CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE LAST FEW 
FORECAST CYCLES. 

TODAY AND TONIGHT - AN EAST-NORTHEAST STEERING FLOW IS EXPECTED 
TODAY WITHIN A MOIST AND CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH 
LITTLE OR NO CONVECTIVE INHIBITION. AS A RESULT...SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM DEVELOPING OVER MAINLAND 
SOUTH FLORIDA...PORTIONS OF THE FLORIDA KEYS...AND ADJOINING COASTAL 
WATERS. THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAINFALL WILL OCCUR IN THE AFTERNOON 
WHEN SEA BREEZES ARE MOST ACTIVE. HOWEVER...IT COULD RAIN AT JUST 
ABOUT ANY TIME. WATERSPOUTS WILL BE A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY WITHIN 
BUILDING CU/TCU LINES...PARTICULARLY ADJACENT TO THE LOWER KEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON.

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT - THIS WILL BE A TRANSITION PERIOD BETWEEN 
EAST-NORTHEAST FLOW IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE TO EAST-SOUTHEAST FLOW. 
A STRENGTHENING ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL RELOCATE NORTH OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...ABSORBING THE ANTICYCLONIC CIRCULATION OVER THE SOUTHERN 
UNITED STATES. DEEP AND STRENGTHENING EASTERLIES WILL DEVELOP OVER 
THE FLORIDA KEYS WITHIN A MOIST AND CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE 
ENVIRONMENT. THE NORTHERN END OF A TROPICAL WAVE IS EXPECTED TO BE 
MOVING OVER THE EASTERN PORTION OF CUBA BY FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH A 
SURGE IN THE EASTERLIES IN ITS WAKE THANKS TO THE STRENGTHENING 
LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC. 
SCATTERED FASTER-MOVING SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE EXPECTED OVER THE 
KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS IN THE STRENGTHENING EASTERLY FLOW. 

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY - A TROPICAL WAVE AXIS SHOULD BE PASSING 
JUST SOUTH OF THE KEYS...BUT MAY BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO ENHANCE 
CONVECTIVE COVERAGE... ESPECIALLY IF THE LOW-LEVEL WIND SURGE IN THE 
EASTERLIES COMES INTO FRUITION AS BOTH THE GFS AND NAM INDICATE.

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY - A LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MEAN RIDGE 
SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE KEYS WITH A MOIST...UNSTABLE EAST OR 
SOUTHEAST FLOW PREVAILING. A CLIMATOLOGICAL FORECAST WILL BE 
MAINTAINED FOR THIS TIME FRAME. 
&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE OR MODERATE EAST BREEZES SHOULD PREVAIL FOR ANOTHER DAY OR 
TWO...BUT BY FRIDAY EVENING...THE EAST BREEZE SHOULD BE FRESHENING 
AS A RIDGE STRENGTHENS NORTH OF THE KEYS AND A TROPICAL WAVE GETS 
CLOSER TO OUR SOUTHEAST. MODERATE TO FRESH BREEZES ARE EXPECTED TO 
SET IN FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY...WITH 15-20KT A 
POSSIBILITY OVER THE WEEKEND. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. ON THE MAINLAND 
LEG OF THE ROUTE...PATCHY MIST IS LIKELY THIS MORNING OVER THE 
EVERGLADES...WHILE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
LIKELY THIS AFTERNOON. MOST TOPS WILL BE AOB FL400 WITH MEAN CELL 
MOTION SLOWLY TOWARD THE WEST. ON THE OVER-WATER PORTION OF THE 
ROUTE ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE LIKELY. WE EXPECT A CLOUD LINE IN 
THE LOWER KEYS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WHICH MEANS THIS WILL BE A 
FAVORED LOCATION FOR SHOWERS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
AN ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS WESTWARD ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTH 
FLORIDA. THIS IS RESULTING IN MAINLY EAST WINDS AT AROUND 10 MPH 
ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. SO FAR TODAY ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS THE STRAITS...AS 
WELL AS SEVERAL ALONG THE CU LINE IN AND AROUND THE LOWER KEYS. THIS 
ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED IN A CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH 
LOTS OF CAPE. DRY AIR IN THE MID LEVELS AND CONSIDERABLE SHEARING 
ABOVE AROUND 15 KFT HAS KEPT THESE CELLS SHORT LIVED WITH THE WEAKER 
SHOWERS BEING ERODED BY ENTRAINMENT. ALOFT THE KEYS ARE SITTING IN A 
REGION OF WEAK NORTHWESTERLIES BETWEEN AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER 
THE EASTERN STATES...AND A BROAD RIDGE EXTENDING NORTHEASTWARD FROM 
CENTRAL AMERICA AND WESTERN CARIBBEAN. MEANWHILE...A LARGE CUT OFF 
LOW EAST OF THE BAHAMAS IS SLOWLY MIGRATING WESTWARD. THERE IS AN 
INVERTED TROUGH AT LOW LEVEL UNDER THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS 
UPPER LEVEL LOW.

.FORECAST...
THE CUT OFF UPPER LEVEL LOW TO THE EAST OF THE BAHAMAS IS DISTORTING 
AND WEAKENING THE WESTERN EXTENT OF THE ATLANTIC RIDGE. THROUGH THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS THE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL REMAIN WEAK. SURFACE 
WINDS WILL CONTINUE MAINLY EASTERLY AT AROUND 10 MPH THROUGH FRIDAY. 
THE LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN CONUS WILL ROTATE 
EASTWARD OVER THE ATLANTIC SEA BOARD...AND BEGIN PICKING UP THE CUT 
OFF LOW ON THURSDAY...AND THEN RAPIDLY SHIFT IT NORTHWARD. THE 
ASSOCIATED LOW LEVEL INVERTED TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO GET SHEARED OUT 
AS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE BUILDS WESTWARD. SOME OF THE ENHANCED LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THIS INVERTED TROUGH IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE KEYS AREA BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THIS IS 
EXPECTED TO AID SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT IN AN ALREADY 
FAVORABLE ENVIRONMENT. NEAR CLIMO TEMPS AND ABOVE CLIMO POPS ARE 
ANTICIPATED THROUGH TOMORROW. OVER THE WEEKEND THE ATLANTIC RIDGE 
WILL BE ABLE TO CONSOLIDATE WITH A HIGH SITTING OVER THE SOUTHERN 
STATES. THIS WILL CAUSE THE GRADIENT ACROSS THE KEYS TO FIRM UP 
HEADING INTO THIS WEEKEND. THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK WEAK 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVERHEAD AND A FAIRLY STRONG PRESSURE RIDGE TO 
OUR NORTH WILL MEAN MAINLY EASTERLY WINDS AT 10 TO 15 MPH AND NEAR 
CLIMO TEMPS AND POPS THROUGH THIS PERIOD.

&&

.MARINE...
FAIRLY WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT TODAY AND TOMORROW WILL RESULT IN 
MAINLY EASTERLY WINDS NEAR 10 KNOTS THROUGH TOMORROW. TOMORROW NIGHT 
THE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS EXPECTED TO TIGHTEN A BIT...AND WINDS WILL 
INCREASE TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS FRIDAY NIGHT...AND PERSIST THROUGH THE 
FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK. THE MAIN EXCEPTION WILL BE WEAKER WINDS 
NEAR THE SOUTH FLORIDA COAST AND STRONGER WINDS AND HIGHER SEAS NEAR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

&&

.AVIATION...
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE VICINITY OF KEYW WILL DISSIPATE BEFORE SUNSET. 
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH TONIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY MORNING. 25 TO 50 PERCENT OF THE MAINLAND PORTION 
(KMIA-60SW KMIA) OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE MAY SEE IFR OR LOWER 
CONDITIONS OVER THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DECREASE IN INTENSITY AND COVERAGE OVER THE

A PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS WESTWARD ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTH FLORIDA. 
THIS IS RESULTING IN MAINLY EAST WINDS AT AROUND 10 MPH ACROSS THE 
KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. THIS MORNINGS SOUNDING INDICATED A 
CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...NO CAPPING...WITH TONS OF CAPE. 
AFTER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THIS MORNING...CU HAS DEVELOPED OVER AND

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS HAVE BEEN NEARLY VOID OF PRECIPITATION 
ECHOES ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA SINCE MIDNIGHT. CURRENTLY... 
TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ISLANDS ARE HOLDING IN THE LOWER 80S...WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S. WINDS ARE BLOWING FROM THE EAST OR 
SOUTHEAST 5-10KT AT MOST LOCAL MARINE PLATFORMS...AND SKIES ARE 
PARTLY CLOUDY.

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS SHOWS WEAK DEEP LAYER MEAN 
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW HAVING SET UP ACROSS THE REGION...WITH THE KEYS 
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A HIGH-LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDING NORTH FROM THE 
CARIBBEAN BASIN...AND A LOW-LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDING WEST-SOUTHWEST 
FROM THE ATLANTIC BASIN.

FORECAST:
THE FORECAST FOR THE NEXT SEVEN DAYS WILL BE GOVERNED IN LARGE PART 
BY THE POSITION OF A LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE. THE RIDGE STARTS OUT 
WEAK AND LOCATED JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS. HOWEVER...BY FOURTH OF JULY 
THE RIDGE SHOULD BE STRONG AND WELL-ESTABLISHED WITH AN AXIS NORTH 
OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. THIS WILL PLACE THE KEYS IN DEEP TRADES 
FOR THE FIRST TIME THIS SEASON.

TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT - THE LOW-LEVEL ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BE 
BUTTING UP AGAINST A CONTINENTAL ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. A THERMAL TROUGH IS LIKELY TO DEVELOP OVER THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA BY AFTERNOON...WITH A BACKING OF THE LOW-LEVEL 
OVER THE KEYS TO WEAK EAST-NORTHEAST...A PERFECT SETUP FOR A LOWER 
KEYS ISLAND CUMULUS LINE. WE WILL WATCH FOR EARLY-AFTERNOON 
CONVECTIVE RAINFALL AND SPOUTS AROUND THE LOWER KEYS...WITH 
LATE-AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY MOVING WEST AND 
SOUTHWEST OFF THE MAINLAND. ABOVE-CLIMO 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES OF 40 
PERCENT WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. 

FRIDAY THROUGH INDEPENDENCE DAY - A LARGE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BECOME 
WELL-ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES...PLACING 
MUCH OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA IN MOIST...UNSTABLE...AND DEEP 
EAST-SOUTHEAST FLOW. THIS SETUP WILL FAVOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
SOME THUNDERSTORMS...WITH SOME PREFERENCE TOWARD THE EARLY MORNING 
TIME FRAME. THE TROPICAL WAVE CURRENTLY APPROACHING THE WINDWARD 
ISLANDS MAY INFLUENCE LOCAL WEATHER BY SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.
&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE EAST BREEZES SHOULD PREVAIL THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. BY 
FRIDAY...A STRONG RIDGE WILL BE SETTING UP NORTH OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...AND WE SHOULD SE A FRESHENING OF THE EASTERLY BREEZE... 
CLOSER TO 15KT. THE MODERATE EAST BREEZE WILL THEN LIKELY PERSIST 
INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE HIGHER IN AND NEAR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB)...LATEST 
AVAILABLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND STREAMLINE ANALYSIS AS OF 200 
PM...DEPICT A FULL LATITUDINAL TROUGH...WITH ITS MAIN AXIS EXTENDING 
FROM LAKE SUPERIOR SOUTHWARD TO NORTHERN LOUISIANA...COVERING THE 
MIDDLE THIRD OF THE CONUS. TO THE EAST...A REGIONAL SCALE 
ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED 200 NM EAST OF CAPE COD. ON THE REGIONAL 
SCALE...A SHORTWAVE IS ANALYZED AT 500 MB NEAR THE ENTIRE WEST COAST 
OF FLORIDA AND THE FLORIDA STRAITS. SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS 
REMAIN BENEATH DRY AIR ABOVE ABOUT 500 MB. 

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 200 
PM...A STATIONARY FRONT SLOPES DOWN THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIAN 
MOUNTAINS. LOW PRESSURE IS DEEPENING IN THE GULF STREAM SEVERAL 
HUNDRED MILES EAST OF SAVANNAH GEORGIA. ON THE REGIONAL 
SCALE...LATEST MSAS DATA AND OBSERVATIONS DEPICT A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS. 

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES EXIST ACROSS THE KEYS 
ISLAND CHAIN AND MOST OF THE ADJOINING WATERS. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE 
FIRED ALONG THE NORTHWEST CUBAN COAST...GENERALLY WEST OF 
HAVANA...BUT CENTRAL CUBA IS UNDERNEATH ABUNDANT MID-LEVEL 
CLOUDINESS...WHICH IS ACTING TO THWART INSOLATION IN THAT 
REGION...AND THUS CONVECTION IN THAT AREA. TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN 
INTO THE UPPER 80S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S. C-MAN STATIONS 
ARE MEASURING SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH 10 METER WINDS BETWEEN 7 AND 10 
KNOTS WITH GUSTS TO BETWEEN 11 AND 13 KNOTS ALONG THE FLORIDA 
REEF...FLORIDA BAY...AND THE NEARSHORE GULF WATERS. 

.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700 TO 200 MB)...TONIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...SHORTWAVE ENERGY STILL NEEDS TO PASS OVER 
THE SERVICE AREA THROUGH THIS EVENING. THOUGH CONVECTION HAS FIRED 
MORE TO THE WEST...LIKE OVER PINAR DEL RIO...STILL SHOULD SEE 
CONVECTION FARTHER TO THE EAST OF HAVANA...AS SHORTWAVE MIGRATES 
EASTWARD. AFTER THE MORE DETECTABLE REGIONAL SCALE SHORTWAVE EXITS 
THE REGION TOMORROW...THE DEEP UPPER TROUGH SLIDES ONLY SLOWLY 
EASTWARD TO NEAR THE EAST COAST BY THURSDAY NIGHT BEFORE DAMPENING 
SOMEWHAT BY FRIDAY. THIS WILL STILL LEAVE THE KEYS A LITTLE MORE 
VULNERABLE FOR WEAK IMPULSES TO PROVIDE A BIT MORE SYNOPTIC SCALE IN 
ADDITION TO GOOD MESOSCALE FORCING THAT WILL ALREADY IN PLACE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

FRIDAY THROUGH INDEPENDENCE DAY...THE UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES WITH A 
FLATTENING TREND OVER THE NORTHERN CONUS...GRADUALLY BECOMING ZONAL 
BY SATURDAY...ALLOWING THE 590 DM PLUS 500 MB HEIGHTS TO MOVE BACK 
NORTHWARD TO OVER SOUTH FLORIDA...THE BAHAMAS AND THE FLORIDA KEYS 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND THE HOLIDAY EARLY NEXT WEEK.  

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...TONIGHT...SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL FIRE UP THIS EVENING BEFORE DARK ACROSS THE NORTH 
SHORE OF CUBA...WITH BOUNDARIES MOVING NORTH ACROSS STRAITS WATERS. 
THESE MAY INTERACT WITH BOUNDARIES ALREADY IN PLACE NEAR THE KEYS 
THIS EVENING. WILL HOLD WITH 40 PERCENT POPS GIVEN ABOVE REASONING.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL REMAIN 
WEAK AND JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. THE KEYS 
WILL REMAIN IN A LIGHT BUT MOIST LOW AND MID LEVEL FLOW. WILL SEE 
THE WINDS REMAIN EASTERLY...BUT DAYTIME HEATING(TROUGHING) ON THE 
MAINLAND COULD ALLOW FOR LOW AND MID LEVEL WINDS TO BACK ENOUGH 
SUPPORTING WELL-DEVELOPED CUMULUS/TCU LINES...ALONG WITH CONVECTION 
MOVING OFF THE MAINLAND. THIS COMBINED WITH AMPLE MOISTURE UP TO 
BETWEEN 700 AND 500 MB...WILL PROMPT ME TO MAINTAIN 40 PERCENT POPS 
THAT IS ALREADY IN THE FORECAST...WITH HIGHER RAIN CHANCES IN THE 
MORNING...LATER AFTERNOON AND EVENINGS.

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL BUILD NORTH OF THE 
BAHAMAS TO ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA. LOWER PRESSURE OVER THE CARIBBEAN 
WILL ALLOW FOR GENTLE TO MODERATE TRADE WINDS ACROSS THE ISLANDS AND 
ADJOINING WATERS. TEMPERATURES AND RAIN CHANCES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL. 

SATURDAY THROUGH INDEPENDENCE DAY...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING WILL BE 
LOCATED FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN WESTWARD TO OVER FLORIDA.  
WIND SPEEDS SHOULD BE BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS. A WAVE...CURRENTLY 
ANALYZED NEAR 11 N 52 W...WILL MOVE WEST-NORTHWESTWARD AND COULD BE 
MOVING ACROSS THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN SEA NEAR THE KEYS LONGITUDE ON 
SUNDAY. THIS WOULD POSSIBLY DELIVER HIGHER RAIN CHANCES AND 
WINDS...BUT THIS IS TOO FAR OUT ATTM. WILL HOLD WITH JUST LOW CHANCE 
POPS THROUGH THIS PERIOD.

.MARINE...LIGHT SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WINDS WILL BECOME MAINLY EAST BY 
TOMORROW. LIGHT WINDS MAY BECOME NORTHEAST OVER THE BAY AND GULF 
WATERS DURING WED AND THURS AFTERNOON. MARINERS WILL HAVE TO WATCH 
OUT FOR POSSIBLE HEAVY RAIN AND THUNDER THIS EVENING ACCOMPANIED BY 
LOW VISIBILITY...LIGHTNING STRIKES...AND A FEW WIND GUSTS OVER 35 
KNOTS...DUE TO PULSE TYPE THUNDERSTORMS.

&&

.AVIATION...
THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP OVER WESTERN CUBA LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON WILL MOVE TO THE NORTH. THESE THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD 
DISSIPATE BEFORE REACHING THE WESTERNMOST KEYS. AS A RESULT...VFR 
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. 

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE IN COVERAGE OVER THE 
MAINLAND PORTION (KMIA-40SW KMIA) OF THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE OVER 
THE NEXT HOUR OR TWO. THE STRONGEST PULSE THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE 
CONFINED TO THE KMIA/KFLL METRO AREAS. THESE STORMS COULD PRODUCE

410 AM EDT TUE JUN 27 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
SEVERAL STRONG PULSE THUNDERSTORMS WHICH ERUPTED IN A SWATH ACROSS 
THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA AROUND MIDNIGHT HAVE DISSIPATED. RECENT SCANS 
FROM THE KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SHOW A LONE THUNDERSTORM MOVING 
SLOWLY NORTH ACROSS THE WATERS BEYOND 40 NAUTICAL MILES 
SOUTH-SOUTHWEST OF DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. OTHERWISE...ONLY A 
FEW LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ARE DETECTED ACROSS THE WATERS BEYOND THE 
REEF...WITH RAIN-FREE CONDITIONS OVER THE ISLANDS. A FEW OF THE 
STORMS WERE QUITE STRONG EARLIER...EXHIBITING 60-65 DBZ REFLECTIVITY 
ECHOES UP TO THE -10C LEVEL...AROUND 21000FT AGL. A THUNDERSTORM 
WIND GUST REPORT OF 45KT WAS RECEIVED AT 137AM EDT FROM A VESSEL 
27NM SOUTH OF AMERICAN SHOAL LIGHT...OFF SUGARLOAF KEY.

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWS WEAK 
RIDGING BEGINNING TO TAKE OVER THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN IN THE LOWER AND 
MIDDLE TROPOSPHERE ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE BAHAMAS...AS THE 
DEEP CYCLONIC FLOW RETREATS NORTHWARD INTO THE MIDLATITUDES. MSL 
PRESSURES ACROSS THE KEYS HAVE RISEN ABOUT 4MB DURING THE LAST 24 
HOURS...AND A SURFACE ANALYSIS AT 06Z SHOWS AN ATLANTIC RIDGE LYING 
RIGHT ACROSS THE ISLAND CHAIN. 

FORECAST:
A LOW-LEVEL RIDGE WILL MOVE SLOWLY TO THE NORTH TODAY AND TONIGHT. 
THE RIDGE WILL THEN LIKELY REMAIN NORTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. GENERAL EASTERLY FLOW WILL PREDOMINATE IN THE SFC-700MB 
LAYER...WITH PERHAPS A FEW SMALL-SCALE TROUGHS IN THE EASTERLY FLOW 
TRAVERSING THE SERVICE AREA. WEAK TO MODERATE INSTABILITY AND MOIST 
CONDITIONS IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER WITH LITTLE CONVECTIVE INHIBITION 
SHOULD ENSURE SCATTERED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY THROUGH THE 
PERIOD...WHICH WILL BE MODULATED DAY-TO-DAY PRIMARILY BY 
SUBSYNOPTIC-SCALE BOUNDARIES. WE HAVE FORECAST HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES 
TODAY AT 50 PERCENT DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF AN UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH WHICH MAY ENHANCE CONVECTIVE COVERAGE BEFORE 
TRAVERSING THE SERVICE AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON. ALSO...STEERING FLOW 
ORIENTATION IS FAVORABLE FOR NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OF CUBAN CONVECTION/ 
OUTFLOWS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...ALTHOUGH THE WEAK 
WIND SPEEDS ARE NOT. THE 12-HOUR FORECAST RAIN CHANCES ARE THEN 
ABOVE CLIMATOLOGY THROUGH THURSDAY...AS THE MOIST LAYER LOOKS TO BE 
FAIRLY DEEP AND BOUNDARY SOURCES APLENTY TO INITIATE CONVECTIVE 
CELLS. THE FORECAST THEN BLEEDS INTO CLIMATOLOGY BEYOND DAY 3. AT 
THIS POINT IT LOOKS LIKE AN EAST OR SOUTHEAST FLOW REGIME WITH 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE WEEKEND. MIDLATITUDE 
DISTURBANCES WILL STAY NORTH...AND TROPICAL WAVES SHOULD STAY SOUTH.

.MARINE...
GENTLE SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH BREEZES WILL PREVAIL TODAY...ALTHOUGH 
WINDS WILL BE STRONGER AND MORE VARIABLE IN AND AROUND SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. BREEZES WILL TURN EAST BY WEDNESDAY AND GRADUALLY 
BECOME MODERATE IN STRENGTH BY LATE THIS WEEK. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
STORMS WILL BE AROUND EACH DAY AND NIGHT...WITH LIGHTNING STRIKES 
AND GUSTY WINDS THE PRIMARY THREATS.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY 
WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THE 
MAINLAND LEG OF THE ROUTE SHOULD CONVERGE ON THE EAST COAST WITH 
MEAN CELL MOTION 20010KT AND MOST TOPS AOB FL400. COVERAGE WITHIN 
THE ROUTE CORRIDOR SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE LIES BETWEEN THE KEYS AND CUBA...WITH BROAD 
CYCLONIC FLOW OVER FLORIDA, THE GULF, AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC NORTH OF 
THE KEYS. KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE COME DOWN IN SPEED TO 5 KT OR SO AT 
ISLAND AND REEF SITES THE PAST COUPLE OF HOURS WHILE WIND DIRECTION 
HAS TURNED FROM SW TO MORE WESTERLY. THIS MAY SUGGEST THAT THE RIDGE 
AXIS TO OUR SOUTH HAS SHIFTED NORTH AND CLOSER TO THE KEYS...AS 
EXPECTED. MEANWHILE...THE KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS HAVE BEEN DEVOID 
OF PRECIPITATION THIS EVENING...DUE TO DRY AIR ALOFT OVER THE 
REGION. GOES SOUNDER IMAGERY AND THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING SHOW 
A SWATH (EAST-WEST ORIENTED) OF DRY AIR ALOFT WITH PRECIPITABLE 
WATER ONLY AROUND 1.5 INCH. 

.FORECAST...
LATE DAY CONVECTION OVER PORTIONS OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND... 
AND CUBA...WHERE THE AIRMASS HAS DEEPER MOISTURE IS NOT EXPECTED TO 
MOVE TOWARD THE KEYS. THUS...A LOW PROBABILITY OF PRECIP OVER THE 
KEYS TONIGHT SEEMS ON TRACK. PUBLIC ZONE FORECASTS WILL BE UPDATED 
JUST TO REMOVE TRANSITIONAL WORDING FOR WINDS...WHICH ARE GOING 
LIGHT AND VARIABLE AS ADVERTISED. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT FROM THE FLORIDA STRAITS...
NORTH OVER THE KEYS DURING THE NIGHT. THIS IS EXPECTED TO KEEP WIND 
SPEEDS DOWN IN THE 5-10 KT RANGE...AND PERHAPS WIND DIRECTION WILL 
GO SE-S AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TONIGHT. A FEW LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS WILL AFFECT 
THE ROUTE...AS WELL AS ISOLATED SHOWERS...BUT THESE SHOULD BE BRIEF 
AT ANY GIVEN LOCATION. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE VERY 
LIGHT...GENERALLY SOUTHWEST TO WEST AT 6 KT OR LESS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
300 PM EDT MON JUN 26 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB)...LATEST 
AVAILABLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND STREAMLINE ANALYSIS DEPICT A WELL 
DEFINED ANTICYCLONE CENTERED A FEW HUNDRED MILES SOUTHEAST OF LONG 
ISLAND. TO THE WEST...THE MAIN AXIS OF A SHARPENING FULL LATITUDINAL 
TROUGH EXTENDS FROM IOWA SOUTH SOUTHEAST TO THE EAST CENTRAL GULF OF 
MEXICO. THIS LARGE SCALE FEATURE HAS ALSO BEGAN TO ABSORB ENERGY 
FROM TROUGHINESS OFF THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA. SOUTH FLORIDA AND 
THE KEYS LIE BENEATH DRY CYCLONIC FLOW ABOVE 700 MB AROUND THE BASE 
OF THIS TROUGH.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 200 
AM...ACTIVE WEATHER IS DEVELOPING ALONG A STATIONARY FRONT NOW 
LOCATED FROM CENTRAL NEW YORK SOUTHWARD TO GEORGIA. A TROUGH IS 
ANALYZED FROM BROAD LOW PRESSURE OVER FLORIDA...CENTERED FROM THE  
NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO SOUTHWESTWARD TO SOUTH OF BUOY 42054. 
CONVECTION IS FIRING ALONG THIS SURFACE FEATURE. OTHER CONVECTION 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH FIRING EAST OF THE PENINSULA... 
OVER BAHAMAS WATERS. SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS ARE NORTH OF A RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE ORIENTED NEAR CUBA.

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...SKIES ARE MOSTLY SUNNY OVER THE KEYS 
ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS...WITH JUST A FEW CUMULUS FOUND 
AOA 3000 FEET OVER THE ISLANDS. SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ARE FIRING 
UP OVER THE NORTH SHORE OF CUBA...WITH KEY WEST RADAR INDICATING 
ISOLATED TOPS TO 50 KFT NEAR HAVANA. SATELLITE AND WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY CLEARLY SHOWS MUCH DRIER HAS PROTRUDED OVER THE KEYS AT THE 
MID AND UPPER LEVELS. TEMPERATURES IN THE KEYS HAVE RISEN INTO THE 
UPPER 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE 
FLORIDA REEF AND SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE NOW REGISTERING SOUTHWEST 
10 METER WINDS BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 15 AND 
20 KNOTS.   

.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700 TO 200 MB)...DRY AIR 
BELOW 700 MB WILL REMAIN IN PLACE TONIGHT...HOWEVER...A STRONG 
VORTICITY LOBE...ASSOCIATED WITH ENERGY OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...AND NEAR THE DEEP BASE OF THE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH...WILL 
GRADUALLY MOVE EASTWARD TO OVER THE KEYS BY TOMORROW. 700-500 MB 
WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BACK MORE TO THE SOUTHWEST...TRANSPORTING IN 
GREATER DEPTH OF MOISTURE AND ASSOCIATED MID-LEVEL POSITIVE 
VORTICITY ADVECTION OVER THE ISLANDS TOMORROW. 500 MB TEMPERATURE 
WILL DROP TO NEAR -8C DURING THE DAY TOMORROW.

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND. THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH IS 
PROGGED TO PULL BACK NORTHWARD TO REMAIN OVER GEORGIA...NORTH 
FLORIDA AND THE CAROLINAS THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK AND INTO NEXT 
WEEKEND. 590+ DM 500 MB HEIGHTS ARE PROGGED TO RETURN ON WEDNESDAY 
AND CONTINUE THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND...WITH VERY DRY AIR REMAINING 
ABOVE 700 MB.

IN THE LOWER LEVELS(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...BROAD LOW PRESSURE STILL 
ANALYZED OVER FLORIDA WILL GRADUALLY PULL NORTHWARD TONIGHT AS A LOW 
LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE MOVES NORTH TO OVER THE KEYS TOMORROW. 
THIS RIDGE WILL EVENTUALLY MOVE NORTH OF THE KEYS ON WEDNESDAY. THE 
RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY BUILD ON THURSDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS 
WILL ALLOW FOR A RETURN TO A MODERATE EASTERLY TRADE WIND REGIME 
THAT IS TYPICAL FOR THIS REGION AS WE APPROACH JULY AND THE HOLIDAY 
NEXT WEEK.

TONIGHT...LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL GRADUALLY DIMINISH AS THEY SHIFT TO 
BETWEEN SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST. WINDS AT THE SURFACE WILL BECOME LIGHT 
BETWEEN SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST BY MORNING. SHOWERS AND STORMS MOVING 
OFF CUBA WILL MOVE INTO THE ATLANTIC WATERS...BUT DO NOT THINK FLOW 
IS STRONG ENOUGH TO BRING SCATTERED ACTIVITY OVER THE ISLANDS. ANY 
BOUNDARIES THAT FLING OFF CUBA COULD COLLIDE. LATEST 12 HOUR NAM AND 
GFS POPS #S ARE IN THE ISOLATED CATEGORY...WILL HOLD A 20% POP 
TONIGHT.

TUESDAY...THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE WILL APPROACH THE KEYS...BUT WILL SEE 
INCREASING MOISTURE FROM SURFACE TO 500 MB...AND INSTABILITY MOVING 
OVER THE ISLANDS ON SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS AHEAD OF THE MID-LEVEL 
WAVE(VORTICITY CENTER). AVERAGE SURFACE TO 20000 FEET FROM THE SOUTH 
SOUTHWEST OF NEAR 10 KNOTS COULD BRING IN FAST MOVING SHOWERS AND 
STORMS OVER THE ISLANDS. THOUGH 12 HOUR POP #S HAVE DROPPED TO ABOUT 
40 PERCENT...WILL STILL HOLD WITH INHERITED GOOD CHANCE POPS. 

TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE WILL 
MOVE TO OVER THE KEYS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING...AND SURFACE WINDS WILL 
GRADUALLY BECOME EASTERLY. THE BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW WILL STILL BE 
LIGHT BUT PWAT(PRECIPITABLE WATER) WILL BE BETWEEN 1.75 AND 2.00 
INCHES. CAN EXPECT A RETURN TO THE MORE NORMAL LATE AFTERNOON 
MESOSCALE EFFECTS WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED STORMS 
OCCURRING. WILL HOLD WITH LOW CHANCE POPS WE ALREADY HAVE IN THE 
FORECAST.

EXTENDED FORECAST...THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL GRADUALLY BECOME WELL ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA AND THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN. THIS WILL ALLOW 
FOR GENTLE TO MODERATE TRADE WINDS...WITH RAIN CHANCES NEAR 30 
PERCENT. HAVE MADE NO CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED FORECAST.
&&

.MARINE...GENTLE TO MODERATE SOUTHWEST WINDS THIS EVENING WILL 
GRADUALLY BECOME LIGHT TO GENTLE EASTERLY WINDS TUESDAY AS THE RIDGE 
MOVES OVERHEAD. GENTLE TO MODERATE BREEZES ARE LIKELY THURSDAY 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. ON TUESDAY...MARINERS WILL HAVE TO LOOK OUT FOR 
STRONGER WINDS AND SEAS IN AND NEAR SHOWERS AND STORMS IN THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS.

&&

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT KEYW AND KMTH THROUGH AT 
LEAST THE NEXT 24 HOURS. INTERMITTENT MVFR CONDITIONS ARE POSSIBLE 
AT KEYW AND KMTH TONIGHT. ANY MVFR CONDITIONS THAT DO DEVELOP AT 
KEYW AND KMTH TONIGHT SHOULD BE NO LONGER THAN 25 MINUTES IN 
DURATION.  

WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DECREASE IN 
INTENSITY AND COVERAGE OVER THE MAINLAND PORTION (KMIA-50SW KMIA) OF 
THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THIS EVENING INTO TONIGHT. 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE IFR CONDITIONS ANTICIPATED ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW

400 AM EDT MON JUN 26 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGE LOOPS REVEAL A COMPLEX UPPER-AIR 
PATTERN ACROSS THE GULF BASIN...FLORIDA PENINSULA...AND BAHAMIAN 
ISLES. TWO PRIMARY CYCLONIC VORTICES ARE NOTED IN THE IMAGERY...ONE 
LOCATED JUST NORTH OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS...AND MOVING NORTH...AND 
THE OTHER CENTERED OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...AND MOVING 
EAST. THESE VORTICES ARE MOVING WITHIN A BROAD...LARGER-SCALE 
CYCLONIC FLOW PATTERN EVOLVING OVER MUCH OF THE EASTERN UNITED 
STATES. WIND FIELDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO SYSTEMS ARE QUITE 
WEAK...WITH WEAK WIND FIELDS ANALYZED IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE AS 
WELL. AT THE SURFACE...A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WAS CENTERED AT 
06Z OVER NORTH FLORIDA AND THE NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
CONFLUENT SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW AROUND 10KT WAS ANALYZED OVER THE 
FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS...AND WAS FEEDING INTO SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS OFF THE FLORIDA SOUTHWEST COAST. CONDITIONS 
WERE RAIN-FREE AT MOST ISLAND LOCATIONS AS OF 0745Z...BUT 
CONSIDERABLE RAINFALL COVERAGE OCCURRED ACROSS THE KEYS EARLIER IN 
THE NIGHT. WE RECEIVED 0.11 INCHES OF RAINFALL AT THE WFO BETWEEN 
MIDNIGHT AND 1AM EDT. MUCH HIGHER AMOUNTS FELL FARTHER UP THE ISLAND 
CHAIN...ACCORDING TO KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR ESTIMATES.

FORECAST:
WE EXPECT THE DEEP CYCLONIC FLOW CURRENTLY IN PLACE ACROSS THE 
REGION TO BE REPLACED BY DEEP ANTICYCLONIC FLOW OVER THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS. LOW-LEVEL FLOW WILL BACK FROM SOUTHWEST TODAY TO SOUTH ON 
TUESDAY TO EAST ON WEDNESDAY...AS AN ATLANTIC SUBTROPICAL RIDGE 
MOVES NORTH ACROSS THE KEYS AND STRENGTHENS. BELOW-AVERAGE MSL 
PRESSURES WILL BE REPLACED BY ABOVE-AVERAGE MSL PRESSURES BY TUESDAY 
NIGHT. BEFORE THEN...HOWEVER...IT LOOKS LIKE THE CYCLONIC 
CIRCULATION CURRENTLY IN THE GULF OF MEXICO MAY PASS THROUGH WEST TO 
EAST WITH A SPOKE OF MID-TROPOSPHERIC VORTICITY AND COOL AIR ALOFT 
ON TUESDAY...THEREBY ENHANCING RAIN CHANCES. THEREAFTER...DAILY 
RAINFALL COVERAGE SHOULD BE LIMITED BY WEAK SYNOPTIC-SCALE 
SUBSIDENCE. HOWEVER...SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND CONDITIONAL 
INSTABILITY WILL BE PRESENT FOR CONVECTIVE INITIATION...WITH THE 
MAIN LIFTING MECHANISMS BEING SUBSYNOPTIC-SCALE IN NATURE. THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE SHOULD VACILLATE OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...STAYING 
NORTH OF THE KEYS THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND.

.MARINE...
GENTLE BREEZES...MAINLY SOUTHWEST NEAR 10KT...SHOULD PREVAIL TODAY 
WITH VARIABLE AND GUSTY WINDS IN AND NEAR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
WINDS WILL BACK TO SOUTH TONIGHT...PERHAPS WITH A PERIOD OF LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE WINDS. BY WEDNESDAY...BREEZES SHOULD RETURN FROM THE 
EAST...AND PERSIST FROM A MAINLY EAST DIRECTION THROUGH THE END OF 
THE WEEK. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE SCATTERED IN 
COVERAGE...OCCURRING BOTH AT DAY AND AT NIGHT. HIGHER RAINFALL 
COVERAGE IS MORE LIKELY ON TUESDAY AS AN UPPER DISTURBANCE PASSES 
THROUGH THE REGION. PRIMARY THUNDERSTORM HAZARDS TO MARINERS WILL BE 
LIGHTNING AND LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS AND HIGHER SEAS.
&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE PERIODS OF MVFR TO 
IFR CIGS AND/OR VIS ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...INCLUDING THE 
KEYS TERMINALS...THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE STRONGEST CELLS WILL BE 
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING WIND GUSTS OF 30 TO 40 KNOTS. OUTSIDE OF 
CONVECTION...SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYS ISLAND TERMINALS WILL AVERAGE 
220/7-12KTS.

1030 PM EDT SUN JUN 25 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
00Z KEY WEST AND MIAMI SOUNDINGS AS WELL AS DOPPLER RADAR COMPOSITE 
REFLECTIVITY LOOPS INDICATE EITHER A 500 MB LOW CENTER OR A 
WELL-DEFINED VORTICITY MAXIMUM WAS OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND 
BETWEEN MIAMI AND NAPLES...MOVING E OR ENE. THE SURFACE AND UPPER 
LEVEL STACKING OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE REGION REMAINS COMPLEX...
BUT A LOWER LEVEL CYCLONIC CENTER SEEMS TO BE GENERALLY OVER CENTRAL 
OR WEST CENTRAL FLORIDA. THERE MAY BE TWO MID LEVEL CYCLONIC CENTERS 
...THE ONE MENTIONED BETWEEN MIAMI AND NAPLES AND THE OTHER OVER THE 
NORTHERN BAHAMAS ASSOCIATED WITH THE HIGH LEVEL (200 MB) CYCLONIC 
CENTER WHICH IS NEAR GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND. SOLID SHOWERS AND 
SCATTERED EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS...SOME WITH VERY HIGH TOPS OF 50 
THSD FT AND WHICH ARE OCCASIONALLY ALIGNED IN ROTATING SWIRLS 
HEADING EAST OVER NORTHERN FLORIDA BAY AND MOST OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
MAINLAND...SUGGEST THAT AN ASSOCIATED MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH IS 
SWINGING EAST OVER THE REGION ON THE SOUTH SIDE OF THE MID LEVEL 
CYCLONIC CENTER. MODELS SHOW THIS FEATURE ALTHOUGH THEY HAVE THE 00Z 
POSITION TOO FAR EAST. MEANWHILE...A SURFACE TROUGH THAT MOVED BACK 
WEST OVER THE KEYS LATE LAST NIGHT AND EARLIER TODAY...STALLED AND 
IS NOW APPARENTLY MOVING BACK EAST AGAIN...AND IS SITUATED FROM NEAR 
THE SW FLORIDA PENINSULA...SOUTH OVER THE LOWER KEYS. KEY WEST WINDS 
ARE LIGHT BUT TENDING TO WEST...BIG PINE AND MARATHON WINDS ARE 
STILL SOUTH. WHILE ONGOING SHOWERS AND STORMS IN FLORIDA BAY ARE 
AIMING TOWARD THE UPPER KEYS...JUST ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE WEST OF THE LOWER KEYS AND VERY LITTLE IS SEEN ON 
RADAR OVER THE STRAITS. SOME NEW SHOWER LINES ARE FORMING OVER GULF 
WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. SOME LATE DAY STORMS STILL LINGER 
OVER CUBA. 

.FORECAST...
THE WEAK SURFACE TROUGH NOW OVER THE LOWER KEYS IS EXPECTED TO SWING 
EAST OVERNIGHT BRINGING WINDS OVER THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS TO 
SOUTHWEST WHILE LOWER KEYS AND GULF WATERS MAY SEE MORE WESTERLY 
WINDS. AN UPPER TROUGH (700-500 MB) SHOULD ALSO RIPPLE ENE OVER THE 
AREA THE NEXT 6 HOURS. THE BULK OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
PROBABLY WILL MOVE OVER PORTIONS OF THE UPPER KEYS...AS WELL AS OVER 
THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND. PUBLIC ZONES CURRENTLY HAVE 50 PCT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS...AND THIS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR OVERNIGHT DUE TO 
POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE AND 
UPPER TROUGH PASSAGES. AS STATED ABOVE...THE UPPER KEYS APPEAR TO BE 
UNDER THE MORE IMMEDIATE THREAT FOR SHOWERS...BUT ADDITIONAL LATE 
NIGHT SHOWERS CANT BE RULED OUT FOR MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH NOW RUNNING FROM CAPE SABLE TO THE LOWER KEYS 
IS EXPECTED TO SWING E AND NE OVERNIGHT...TAKING MIDDLE AND UPPER 
KEYS WINDS TO SW AND MAYBE INCREASING INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE. LOOK 
FOR LOWER KEYS AND GULF WATERS TO BE SW OR WSW. KEYS WATERS ARE 
STILL SUSCEPTIBLE TO SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
AREAS OF RAIN WITH EMBEDDED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT 
MUCH OF THE 60SW KMIA-KEYW PORTION OF THE ROUTE THROUGH AT LEAST 
MIDNIGHT...BEFORE DIMINISHING AND MOVING OUT DURING THE EARLY 
MORNING HOURS. THIS WILL RESULT IN SCATTERED MVFR AND ISOLATED IFR 
CONDITIONS OVER THE MAINLAND THROUGH AROUND 06Z. OTHERWISE...VFR 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT THE 
ISLAND TERMINALS THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING. WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH 
WILL BE SOUTHWEST TO WEST AT LESS THAN 10 KT.

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB)...LATEST 
AVAILABLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND STREAMLINE ANALYSIS AS OF 200 
PM...DEPICT A SIGNIFICANT FULL LATITUDINAL LATE SEASON TROUGH WITH 
ITS AXIS EXTENDING FROM AN UPPER LOW OVER SOUTHERN MINNESOTA 
SOUTHWARD TO MISSISSIPPI. A REGIONAL SCALE ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED 
JUST OFFSHORE OF THE CAROLINAS. TO THE SOUTH...A NORTHWEST TO 
SOUTHEAST ELLIPTICALLY SHAPED BUT LESS VERTICALLY ORIENTED CYCLONE 
IS NOW LOCATED NEAR GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 200 
AM...A STATIONARY FRONT EXTENDS FROM NEW YORK CITY SOUTHWEST TO 
ALABAMA. A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE NORTH CENTRAL 
ATLANTIC OCEAN SOUTHWEST TO THE CAROLINA COAST. LATEST MSAS ANALYSIS 
AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE A BROAD 1011 MB LOW POSITIONED 
OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA...WITH ANOTHER CENTER OFF THE NORTHEAST FLORIDA 
COAST.

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...SATELLITE IMAGERY IS DEPICTING A LARGE 
AREA OF HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COVERING THE ISLANDS FROM 
LOWER MATECUMBE KEY TO KEY WEST...INCLUDING ADJOINING MOST OF 
FLORIDA BAY AND THE NEARSHORE AND OFFSHORE GULF WATERS. TEMPERATURES 
TODAY HAVE ONLY CLIMBED INTO THE LOWER 80S. AS OF 200 PM...NUMEROUS 
SHOWERS WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE RESULTED IN TREMENDOUS 
RAINFALL TOTALS OVER WATERS TO THE NORTH OF THE ISLANDS...WITH 5 TO 
8 INCH TOTALS OVER THE FLORIDA BAY AND GULF WATERS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
OF OVER 2 INCHES HAVE OCCURRED IN THE UPPER KEYS SINCE THIS 
MORNING...WITH LOCATIONS OF ONE INCH OR LESS IN THE LOWER KEYS. AT 
PRESENT...KEY WEST RADAR IS DEPICTING NUMEROUS HEAVY SHOWERS...WITH 
EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE ENTIRE FLORIDA BAY AND NEARSHORE 
GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE 
PRESENT ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS. OVER LAND SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVERSPREAD MOST OF THE LOWER KEYS...ALL OF THE MIDDLE 
KEYS...AND A FEW PORTIONS OF THE UPPER KEYS.

.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700 TO 200 MB)...12Z 
NAM...ECMWF..AND GFS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE UPPER LOW BECOMING LESS 
ORGANIZED AS IT IS LIFTED NORTHWARD BY THE LARGE SCALE TROUGH 
APPROACHING FLORIDA FROM THE WEST ATTM. THERE IS STILL POTENTIAL FOR 
THE UPPER LOW TO REMAIN OFFSHORE OF THE FLORIDA MID-ATLANTIC COAST 
UNDERNEATH SOME 200 MB DIFFLUENCE. ENERGY AND MOISTURE FROM THIS 
SYSTEM LIKELY TO BECOME ABSORBED ON RIGHT SIDE OF THE TROUGH THROUGH 
THE MIDDLE OF THE UPCOMING WEEK. A VERY WEAK UPPER PRESSURE PATTERN 
WILL CONTINUE OVER THE KEYS BEHIND THE TROUGH FOR MONDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WITH IMPULSES IN THE FORM OF CIRRUS MOVING 
OVERHEAD THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...HIGHER PRESSURES WILL MOVE OVERHEAD OF 
THE KEYS FOR LATER IN THE WEEK THROUGH THE WEEKEND...AS A LARGE 
ANTICYCLONE BECOMES REESTABLISHED OVER THE CARIBBEAN.

IN THE LOWER LEVELS(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...MAIN STORY IS THE BROAD LOW 
PRESSURE AREA NOW OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA. THIS SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO 
MOVE OFF THE NORTHEAST FLORIDA COAST BY TOMORROW OR TOMORROW NIGHT. 
THEREAFTER...LOW LEVEL RIDGING TO THE SOUTH OF THE KEYS WILL 
GRADUALLY MOVE NORTH...MOVING OVER THE KEYS IN TUESDAY AND TUESDAY 
NIGHT...AND THEN NORTH OF THE KEYS FROM MID-WEEK THROUGH NEXT 
WEEKEND.

TONIGHT...THE SURFACE LOW WILL NOT MOVE VERY FAR NORTH. CURRENT 
EXTENT OF RADAR COVERAGE PATTERNS...AVAILABLE INSTABILITY...AND 
WIDESPREAD SYNOPTIC LIFT ALREADY IN PLACE...WILL PROMPT ME TO KEEP 
LOW LIKELY POPS IN THE FIRST PART OF THE FORECAST FOR THIS EVENING. 
AS THE CIRCULATION PULLS NORTHWARD LATER TONIGHT...WILL STILL HAVE 
ENOUGH BOUNDARIES AROUND FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO 
FORM LATER ON. WIDESPREAD COVERAGE WILL BEGIN TO DISAPPEAR TO JUST 
SCATTERED COVERAGE AS THE MAIN LOW PULLS FAR ENOUGH NORTHWARD LATER 
TONIGHT.

TOMORROW...AS THE MAIN LOW PULLS CONTINUES TO PULL NORTHWARD...12Z 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL STILL BE 
WITHIN SOUTHWEST FLOW ON THE PERIPHERY OF THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVEL 
CIRCULATION. DESPITE A BIT MORE SUN THEN CLOUDS...SURFACE HEATING 
WILL PROVIDE IDEAL SET-UP FOR REVERSE CUMULUS-LINES TO DEVELOP OVER 
THE ISLANDS. HAVE ELECTED TO KEEP POPS NEAR 40 PERCENT. TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD RETURN CLOSER TO NORMAL HIGHS.

TOMORROW NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE NEAR 
CUBA WILL MOVE SLOWLY NORTHWARD TO OVER THE STRAITS AND THE FLORIDA 
KEYS ON TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. SURFACE WINDS WILL BACK TO 
BETWEEN SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH...GRADUALLY BECOMING LIGHT AND VARIABLE 
AS THE RIDGE MOVES BACK OVERHEAD. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A RETURN TO 
STRICTLY MESOSCALE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM CUMULUS/TCU LINES 
AND MAINLAND CONVECTION PRODUCING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES. NO CHANGE TO 
LOW CHANCE POPS WE HAVE.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...LOOKS LIKE A RETURN TO A NORMAL EARLY 
SUMMER TRADE WIND REGIME. EXPECT GENTLE WINDS VARYING FROM NORTHEAST 
TO SOUTHEAST. EXPECT RAIN CHANCES TO CONTINUE JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
NORMAL...OWING TO DAILY MESOSCALE EFFECTS. TEMPERATURE MAXIMA AND 
MINIMA WILL BE NEAR NORMAL. WILL HOLD WITH LOW CHANCE POPS.

&&

.MARINE...MAIN STORY WILL BE NUMEROUS TO WIDESPREAD SHOWER COVERAGE 
WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE BAY AND NEARSHORE GULF WATERS. 
VISIBILITY IN HEAVY RAIN WILL RAPIDLY DETERIORATE TO LESS THAN 1 
NM...AND GUSTY WINDS ARE STILL POSSIBLE IN THE HEAVIEST SHOWERS AND 
STORMS. WILL INCLUDE WORDING FOR THIS. SURFACE WINDS FROM SOUTHWEST 
THROUGH TOMORROW WILL GRADUALLY BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE ON TUESDAY 
AND TUESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE BECOMING EAST FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.

&&

.AVIATION...SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE ALONG THE 
KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THIS EVENING. SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
AFFECT STRETCHES OF THE ROUTE WITH PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR 
CIGS/VSBYS...WITH SIMILAR CONDITIONS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND

AVAILABLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND STREAMLINE ANALYSIS DEPICT A WELL 
DEFINED ANTICYCLONE CENTERED A FEW HUNDRED MILES EAST OF THE 
DELMARVA PENINSULA. TO THE WEST...THE MAIN AXIS OF A BROAD AND DEEP 
TROUGH IS CENTERED FROM THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY 
SOUTHWARD TO NEW ORLEANS. 

ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...A DECENT VORTICITY LOBE OVER THE EASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO IS PIVOTING EASTWARD AROUND THE BASE OF THIS TROUGH. 
ANOTHER ELONGATED TROUGH IS CENTERED JUST EAST OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA. SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS LIE BENEATH DRY CYCLONIC FLOW 
ABOVE 700 MB AROUND THE BASE OF THIS TROUGH.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 900 
AM...A STATIONARY FRONT IS POSITIONED FROM CENTRAL NEW YORK SOUTH 
SOUTHWESTWARD TO GEORGIA. THE CENTER OF BROAD BUT WEAK 1009 MB LOW 
PRESSURE IS ANALYZED OVER THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...WITH THE 
PERIPHERY OF IT ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. 


.CURRENTLY...AS OF 900 AM...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUD OVER THE KEYS 
ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS. SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY 
IMAGERY DETECTS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ALONG A 
LOW-LEVEL CONFLUENT BOUNDARY OVER THE GULF WATERS 25 TO 60 NM WEST 
OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY. SOUTH OF THAT...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSITIONED WITHIN THE IMMEDIATE NEARSHORE GULF 
WATERS ALONG A BROKEN BUT DEVELOPING CUMULUS/TCU LINE JUST NORTH OF 
THE LOWER KEYS. TEMPERATURES ARE PRESENTLY IN THE MIDDLE 80S WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. THE MORNING SOUNDING...12Z WAS AGAIN 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER NEAR 1.60 INCHES. AN 
11Z QUICKSCAT PASS REVEALED THAT WINDS ARE NOW SOUTHWEST AT 10 TO 15 
KNOTS OVER THE WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS...AND BETWEEN SOUTHWEST AND 
SOUTH ACROSS OTHER WATERS.
   
.FORECAST...TODAY AND TONIGHT...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...ENERGY 
FROM THE SMALLER SCALE UPPER TROUGH NOW EAST OF FLORIDA...WILL 
GRADUALLY BECOME ABSORBED INTO THE APPROACHING FULL LATITUDINAL 
TROUGH BY TONIGHT. THE 500-300 MB VORT CENTER NOW OVER THE EASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO WILL SLIDE EAST THROUGH TONIGHT. 

IN THE LOWER AND MID LEVELS...NEAR 1010 MB BROAD LOW PRESSURE NOW 
CENTERED NEAR APALACHEE BAY...WILL DRIFT SLOWLY NORTHEAST TO OVER 
GEORGIA BY THE END OF THE DAY. IT WILL REMAIN SUFFICIENTLY MOIST 
FROM THE SURFACE TO 700 MB...WITH AVERAGE 240 DEGREE WINDS FROM THE 
SURFACE TO ALMOST 20000 FEET. THIS...COMBINED WITH ENHANCED LOW 
LEVEL LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH BROAD LOW PRESSURE...WOULD SUPPORT A GOOD 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS 
AND ADJOINING WATERS...HOWEVER...THE 0 TO 6 KM AVERAGE WINDS ARE 
NEAR 13 KNOTS...AND THIS MAY BE A BIT TOO STRONG TO SUPPORT CELLS 
DEVELOPING RIGHT OVER THE ISLANDS...AS THEY MAY PUSH FARTHER TO THE

WILL HOLD WITH THE LOW CHANCE POPS THAT WE ALREADY HAVE. NO CHANGES 
TO FORECAST.

&&

.MARINE...GENTLE TO MODERATE SOUTHWEST TO WEST WINDS WILL BECOME 
LIGHT TO GENTLE AND BACK TO BETWEEN SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST BY LATER IN 
THE DAY...AS BROAD LOW PRESSURE PULLS NORTHWARD AWAY FROM FLORIDA. 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE CONFINED TO GULF WATERS 
OFFSHORE OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY. COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED IN THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS...BUT CONVECTION FIRING UP OVER CUBA MAY ALLOW FOR 
COVERAGE TO INCREASE LATER IN THE DAY OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS.

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB)...LATEST 
AVAILABLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND STREAMLINE ANALYSIS DEPICT MORE 
ROBUST TROUGHING DEVELOPING OVER THE MIDWESTERN AND EAST 
STATES...WITH A TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING FROM AN UPPER LOW OVER 
SOUTHERN MINNESOTA SOUTHWARD TO ARKANSAS. A REGIONAL SCALE 
ANTICYCLONE IS CENTERED OFFSHORE OF THE CAROLINAS. TO THE SOUTH...AN 
OVALLY SHAPED BUT WELL STACKED CYCLONE IS POSITIONED BETWEEN GRAND 
BAHAMA ISLAND AND THE FLORIDA PENINSULA.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...AS OF 900 
AM...A COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM LONG ISLAND SOUTHWEST TO WEST 
VIRGINIA...BECOMING STATIONARY DOWN TO NORTH GEORGIA. A WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM THE NORTH CENTRAL 
ATLANTIC OCEAN SOUTHWEST TO THE CAROLINAS. A MESSY AND BROAD AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE EXISTS ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA WITH LATEST MSAS 
ANALYSIS AND SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATING A 1012 MB CENTER MAY BE 
OVER THE EVERGLADES.

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 900 AM...SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY OVER THE KEYS 
ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS...WITH LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY 
DEPICTING LARGE CUMULONIMBUS CLUSTERS OVER FLORIDA BAY AND NEARSHORE 
GULF WATERS WITH LOW AND MID CLOUDS BENEATH CIRRUS COVERING THE 
LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS...AND LOTS OF JUST LOW CUMULUS/TCUS OVER THE 
UPPER KEYS. KEY WEST RADAR IS DETECTING A LARGE CLUSTER OF SHOWERS 
AND EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FLORIDA BAY AND NEARSHORE GULF 
WATERS. ADDITIONAL SHOWERS ARE FIRING UP OVER THE WESTERN LOWER 
KEYS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 80 DEGREES WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 
70S. THE 12Z MORNING SOUNDING IS MODERATELY UNSTABLE AND VERY 
MOIST...WITH PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) AT JUST OVER 2.00 INCHES...OR 
2.01 INCHES. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH...MIAMI SOUNDING IS EVEN 
WETTER...WITH 2.19 INCHES PRECIPITABLE WATER. WINDS ALONG THE 
FLORIDA REEF AND IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE SOUTHWEST 
   
.FORECAST...TODAY AND TONIGHT...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...THE 
MID AND UPPER TROUGH CENTERED OVER THE EAST-CENTRAL UNITED STATES 
WILL BEGIN TO LIFT UP THE UPPER LOW NOW APPROACHING THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA FROM THE SOUTHEAST...MOVING THE UPPER LOW OVER TO NEAR 
LAKE OCHEE BY TONIGHT...AND TO NORTH FLORIDA BY TOMORROW. THIS 
SHOULD PROVIDE ENHANCED SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT ACROSS THE PENINSULA FOR 
TODAY...AND THIS WILL MAINTAIN WIDESPREAD SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORMS 
OVER THE KEYS. IN ADDITION...SURFACE TO 20000 FOOT WINDS WILL 
GRADUALLY BECOME SOUTHWESTERLY. THIS WILL AID IN CUMULUS/TCU LINES 
ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE KEYS THAT GET EVEN A LITTLE SUNSHINE.

IN THE LOWER AND MID LEVELS...BROAD LOW PRESSURE WILL AMBLE 
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS CONTINUE 
TO INDICATE MODERATELY UNSTABLE MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATES BETWEEN 6 
DEGREES C/KM. THIS WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPORT ISOLATED PULSE STORMS 
EMBEDDED WITHIN FAIRLY DEEP AND WET CONVECTION. CURRENT RADAR 
COVERAGE IS CONFINED MAINLY TO FLORIDA BAY...THE MIDDLE KEYS...AND 
THE EASTERN LOWER KEYS. CURRENT 06Z MAV #S RANGE FROM THE GOOD 
CHANCE TO LOW LIKELY CATEGORY FOR TODAY. 

BASED ON THE ABOVE CURRENT RADAR COVERAGE PATTERN AS WELL AS 
SYNOPTIC AND MESOSCALE TRENDS...HAVE DECIDED TO INCREASE POPS TO LOW 
LIKELY CATEGORY.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER THEN 
EXPECTED UNDER LOTS OF CLOUD COVER. WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO

420 AM EDT SUN JUN 25 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWS A DEEP... 
BUT WEAK AND SLOW-MOVING COLD-CORE CYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE 
NORTHERN BAHAMAS. THE SYSTEM HAS MOVED MORE DECIDEDLY TO THE 
WEST-NORTHWEST DURING THE LAST 12 HOURS...PROBABLY ATTRACTED BY 
GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES. 
DEEP...MOIST CONVECTION IS SCATTERED ABOUT THE CIRCULATION...WITH A 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER CONCENTRATION OF CELLS ALONG THE WESTERN PERIPHERY 
OF THE SYSTEM...OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND ADJOINING COASTAL 
WATERS. AT THE SURFACE...LOWEST MSL PRESSURES ARE ANALYZED OVER 
MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA...NEAR 1011MB. A BROAD CYCLONIC ENVELOPE 
COVERING THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...NORTHERN BAHAMAS...AND ADJACENT 
WATERS IS EVIDENT IN LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC STREAMLINE ANALYSES. 
SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGES SUGGEST THE PRESENCE OF A FEW 
SUBSYNOPTIC-SCALE CYCLONIC CIRCULATIONS MOVING WITHIN THE 
LARGER-SCALE AND BROAD CYCLONIC ENVELOPE. 

CURRENTLY...THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE ALONG THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREA...AND JUST WEST OF THE DEEP LAYER MEAN 
CYCLONE. A STRONG...SPRAWLING ANTICYCLONE IS SITUATED NORTHEAST AND 
EAST OF SURFACE LOW PRESSURE...ACROSS MUCH OF THE NORTH ATLANTIC 
OCEAN.

THE KEY WEST SATURDAY EVENING SOUNDING HAD INDICATED ONLY WEAK 
INSTABILITY WITH MOIST CONDITIONS IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER...BUT WITH 
SOME DRIER AIR BETWEEN 850-700MB. HOWEVER...GPS-MET SENSORS AT KEY 
WEST AND GEIGER KEY INDICATE AN INCREASING TREND IN TOTAL 
PRECIPITABLE WATER SINCE SATURDAY EVENING. KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR 
SCANS HAVE SHOWN A GRADUAL INCREASE IN SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
COVERAGE ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA SINCE MIDNIGHT...WITH A FEW 
VIGOROUS PULSE CELLS DETECTED EXHIBITING STRONG UPDRAFTS AND 
ELEVATED HIGH-REFLECTIVITY CORES. INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES HAVE 
REVEALED CONVECTIVE CLOUD TOP TEMPERATURES AS COLD AS -63C. IT SEEMS 
CLEAR THAT STATIC STABILITY HAS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE 
AREA SINCE THE SATURDAY EVENING RAWINSONDE OBSERVATION.

FORECAST:
OUR PROGNOSIS IS FOR THE DEEP CYCLONE TO MOVE SLOWLY WEST-NORTHWEST 
OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS. THE 
LOW-LEVEL WIND PROFILE ACROSS THE AREA WILL GRADUALLY BACK AS THE 
SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS PENINSULA. HIGHER AND LOWER MOISTURE/INSTABILITY 
FIELDS SEEM TO BE ORIENTED IN NARROW ZONES CIRCULATING IN AND AROUND 
THE CYCLONE...ALTHOUGH DIAGNOSIS OF THESE IN TIME AND SPACE HAS BEEN 
DIFFICULT. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE HIGHER IN BOTH COVERAGE 
AND INTENSITY DURING THE PRESENCE OF ONE OF THESE ZONES OF HIGHER 
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY.

TODAY AND TONIGHT - LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MEAN FLOW WILL BE WESTERLY 
TODAY...BACKING TO WEST-SOUTHWEST BY THIS AFTERNOON OR EVENING. IF 
INSOLATION IS SUFFICIENT...A REVERSE LOWER KEYS CUMULUS LINE COULD 
SET UP...WITH LOCALLY ENHANCED AFTERNOON RAIN/WATERSPOUT CHANCES. 
RAIN CHANCES WILL BE MAINTAINED AT AN ABOVE-AVERAGE 40 PERCENT OWING 
TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE DEEP LAYER CYCLONE AND ENHANCED 
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY FIELDS TO THE SERVICE AREA.

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT - THE DEEP LAYER CYCLONE THAT HAS BEEN IN 
THE SUBTROPICS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS FINALLY GETS DRAWN INTO THE 
MIDLATITUDES. A DEEP LAYER MEAN RIDGE THEN SETS UP WITH AN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE SETTING UP IN LOW LEVELS JUST SOUTH OF THE KEYS MONDAY NIGHT. 
THE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MEAN FLOW WILL BACK FURTHER TO SOUTHWEST. 
SUFFICIENT MOISTURE INSTABILITY WILL REMAIN FOR CONVECTIVE 
INITIATION...AND CUBAN SEA-BREEZE THUNDERSTORMS MAY PROVIDE AN 
ENHANCEMENT TO THE LOCAL CONVECTIVE THREAT DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING.

TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY - THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL MOVE GRADUALLY 
NORTH...SETTING UP OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA BY WEDNESDAY...WITH 
LOW-LEVEL EASTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS. 
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY SHOULD REMAIN SUFFICIENT FOR SCATTERED 
SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE...WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHT NOCTURNAL 
ENHANCEMENT.

THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY - THE ATLANTIC RIDGE SHOULD REMAIN NORTH 
OF THE KEYS OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...WITH MOIST...UNSTABLE 
EASTERLY LOW-LEVEL FLOW DOMINATING. HENCE...A CLIMATOLOGY FORECAST.

.MARINE...
GENTLE BREEZES...MAINLY WEST-SOUTHWEST NEAR 10KT...SHOULD PREVAIL 
TODAY WITH VARIABLE AND GUSTY WINDS IN AND NEAR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. WINDS WILL BACK TO SOUTHWEST BY TONIGHT...THEN SOUTH 
BY MONDAY NIGHT...RETURNING TO EAST BY TUESDAY NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY... 
AS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE SETS UP NORTH OF THE KEYS. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE SCATTERED IN COVERAGE...OCCURRING BOTH AT DAY 
AND AT NIGHT...WITH THE PRIMARY HAZARDS BEING LIGHTNING AND LOCALLY 
GUSTY WINDS AND HIGHER SEAS.
&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE PERIODS OF MVFR TO 
IFR CIGS AND/OR VIS ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY. SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER AND SOUTH OF THE KEYS TERMINALS EARLY 
THIS MORNING SHOULD DECREASE IN COVERAGE...AS COVERAGE OVER THE 
MAINLAND PORTION OF THE FLIGHT ROUTE WILL INCREASE LATE THIS MORNING 
AND AFTERNOON. STRONGEST CELLS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING WIND 
GUSTS OF 30 TO 40 KNOTS. OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION...SURFACE WINDS AT 
THE KEYS ISLAND TERMINALS WILL AVERAGE 220/8-12KTS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
00Z (8 PM EDT) SURFACE REPORTS SUGGEST A WEAK AND POSSIBLY COMPLEX 
(PERHAPS SEVERAL WEAK CENTERS) NORTH OF THE NORTHERNMOST BAHAMAS AND 
EAST OF CAPE CANAVERAL. A WEAK TROUGH IS ANALYZED DRAPING SOUTHWARD 
FROM THE VAGUE LOW CENTER...AND THREADING BETWEEN THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
PENINSULA AND GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND...THENCE SOUTH TO CENTRAL CUBA. 
ANOTHER WEAK LOW CENTER MAY BE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE TROUGH BETWEEN 
THE SE PENINSULA AND THE BAHAMAS. KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING 
FROM THE W TO NW AT MOST KEYS WIND GAUGES (UPPER KEYS WERE SW 
EARLIER BUT ARE NW NOW BECAUSE OF AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY) AND SPEEDS 
HAVE BEEN RUNNING HIGHER THAN MODELS HAVE INDICATED...WITH C-MAN AND 
ISLAND SITES SHOWING 10-15 KT WINDS. STRONG MAINLAND CONVECTION 
EARLIER HAS DIED DOWN...BUT DID PUSH OUTFLOW WINDS AND A FEW SHOWERS 
OVER THE UPPER KEYS...WITH GUSTS TO 29 KT AT MOLASSES REEF BETWEEN 7 
AND 8 PM. THE EVENING SOUNDING AT KEY WEST CONTINUED TO SHOW DRY AIR 
ALOFT...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER ONLY 1.46 INCH DUE TO DRYNESS AT AND 
ABOVE 700 MB...WHILE THE MIAMI SOUNDING WAS VERY WET DUE TO EFFECTS 
OF LATE DAY CONVECTION OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. 

.FORECAST...
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MAY YET SPARK SOME CONVECTION OVER THE KEYS AREA. 
IN ADDITION...ALL MODELS INDICATE THAT THE WEAK SURFACE TROUGH 
EXTENDING SOUTH OVER THE STRAITS BETWEEN THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA 
AND THE BAHAMAS TO CUBA...WILL NUDGE WESTWARD OVERNIGHT. THIS 
FEATURE MAY FOCUS SHOWER DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT AS WELL. WHILE WIND 
SPEEDS MAY DROP SOME OVERNIGHT...IT APPEARS THAT W TO NW WINDS 
SHOULD PREVAIL FOR A WHILE BUT GRADUALLY GO SW TO W OVER EASTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE KEYS DURING THE LATE NIGHT HOURS. I WONT PLAN TO 
UPDATE ZONES AT THIS TIME...SINCE THE THREAT OF NEW SHOWER 
DEVELOPMENT MAY BE WITH US THROUGH THE NIGHT...AND WIND SPEEDS OVER 
ISLAND MAY YET COME DOWN INTO THE 5-10 MPH RANGE. 
&&

.MARINE...
W TO NW WINDS HAVE BEEN BLOWING IN THE 10-15 KT RANGE THIS EVENING.
A WEAK TROUGH EAST OF THE KEYS MAY DRIFT WEST...GRADUALLY TURNING 
WINDS INTO THE SW TO W SECTION OF THE COMPASS. MODELS HAVE BEEN A 
BIT LOW ON WIND SPEEDS THIS EVENING.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KEYW-KMIA TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS OVERNIGHT. AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN WILL AFFECT THE 
MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE EARLY...AND AT TIMES THE UPPER KEYS 
AND FLORIDA BAY AS WELL...ALONG WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE MAINLAND. THE LIGHT RAIN SHOULD DIMINISH BY 
THE EARLY MORNING HOURS...AFTER WHICH ONLY ISOLATED CIRCUMNAVIGABLE 
CONVECTION WILL AFFECT THE ROUTE...PRODUCING LOCALIZED MVFR 
CONDITIONS AND A FEW BRIEF IFR VISIBILITIES IN STRONGER CELLS. 
SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE NORTHWEST AT 10 KT OR 
LESS...BECOMING WEST SOUTHWEST BY MORNING.

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB)...LATEST 
AVAILABLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND STREAMLINE ANALYSIS AS OF 200 
PM...DEPICT A LARGE SCALE BROADENING LOW AMPLITUDE TROUGH FROM THE 
DAKOTAS TO NEW ENGLAND...WITH EMBEDDED SHORT WAVE FEATURES. ONE 
IDENTIFIABLE SHORT-WAVE IS ALIGNED NEAR THE SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER VALLEY.  FARTHER TO THE SOUTHEAST...A WELL DEFINED YET COLD 
CORE MID AND UPPER CYCLONE IS SITUATED NEAR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. 
THE FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN BENEATH RATHER DRY CYCLONIC FLOW.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...A COLD FRONT 
EXTENDS FROM SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND SOUTHWEST TO NORTH TEXAS. A 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM THE NORTH 
CENTRAL ATLANTIC OCEAN SOUTHWESTWARD TO NEAR CAPE HATTERAS NORTH 
CAROLINA. TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THAT...A 1012 MB POORLY ORGANIZED 
BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA IS SITUATED JUST NORTHEAST OF THE NORTHERN 
BAHAMAS. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN WEAK LOW LEVEL STEERING FLOW 
AHEAD OF THIS DISORGANIZED SYSTEM. 

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 200 PM...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY OVER THE KEYS 
ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJOINING WATERS. KEY WEST RADAR DETECTS A LONG 
CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE OFFSHORE GULF WATERS 
25 TO 60 NM WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY...WITH ANOTHER CLUSTER 
ACROSS THE IMMEDIATE ATLANTIC NEARSHORE WATERS WITHIN 5 NM OFFSHORE 
TAVERNIER TO CRAIG KEY. C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE REEF AND SOUTHERN 
FLORIDA BAY ARE REGISTERING SOUTHWEST TO NORTHWEST 10 METER WINDS 
BETWEEN 8 AND 10 KNOTS...EXCEPT AT LONG KEY WHICH REGISTERED 15 
KNOTS IN AN OUTFLOW NEAR A HEAVY SHOWER.

.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700 TO 200 MB)...12Z 
NAM...GFS...AND ECMWF MODELS ARE CONSISTENT WITH INDICATIONS THAT 
THE WELL DEVELOPED UPPER LOW NEAR THE BAHAMAS WILL MOVE ASHORE NEAR 
CENTRAL OR NORTH FLORIDA TOMORROW...WITH DEEP MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
MOISTURE REMAINING ABSENT OVER THE KEYS. A SHORT WAVE OVER THE MID 
SOUTH WILL GRADUALLY AMPLIFY INTO A DECENT TROUGH ON MONDAY. THIS 
SYSTEM SHOULD EJECT OUT THE SYSTEM OVER CENTRAL OR NORTHERN FLORIDA. 
MODELS KEEP BROAD TROUGHING OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND EAST COAST 
THROUGH MOST OF NEXT WEEK. 590 DM 500 MB HEIGHTS WILL BUILD BACK IN 
OVER CUBA AND THE FLORIDA KEYS BY FRIDAY...CONTINUE THROUGH NEXT 
WEEKEND.

IN THE LOWER LEVELS(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...THE MAIN STORY CONTINUES TO 
BE BROAD LOW PRESSURE NEAR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. THIS SYSTEM REMAINS 
POORLY ORGANIZED. IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY TO THE WEST OR 
WEST NORTHWEST TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. 12Z ECMWF AND NAM NOW TAKE THIS 
SYSTEM FURTHER TO THE NORTH BEFORE CROSSING THE FLORIDA COAST. STILL 
FEEL THE MAIN IMPACT OF THIS SYSTEM PASSING TO THE NORTH WILL BE 
MAINLY SLIGHTLY ENHANCED RAIN CHANCES IN THE FORM OF GUSTY SHOWERS 
AND STORMS. THIS WILL BE IN ASSOCIATION WITH SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT 
TOMORROW AND TOMORROW NIGHT...POSSIBLY ON MONDAY AS WELL. THE 
GREATEST RAIN CHANCES WILL STILL BE PASSING TO OUR NORTH OVER THE 
PENINSULA. SOME PULSE TYPE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF DELIVERING 
ISOLATED BRIEF WIND GUSTS OVER 35 KNOTS THIS EVENING.

TOMORROW AND TOMORROW NIGHT...BOTH 12Z GFS AND NAM FORECAST SOUNDING 
FOR 18Z TO 00Z TOMORROW ALSO INDICATE WEST TO SOUTHWEST WINDS FROM 
THE SURFACE TO 20000 FT. BASED ON THE MESOSCALE AND SYNOPTIC 
ENVIRONMENT TOMORROW AND TOMORROW NIGHT...WILL RAISE POPS 10 
PERCENT. WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AT 5 TO 10 
KNOTS OVERNIGHT...UNTIL THE SYSTEM GETS A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED TO 
OUR NORTH LATE TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...WHEN WINDS SHOULD INCREASE TO 
NEAR 10 KNOTS...EXCEPT WINDS OVER THE ATLANTIC WATERS MAY INCREASE 
TO 10 TO 15 KNOTS. 

MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...THE SYSTEM WILL MOVE SLOWLY NORTHWARD ON 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL REMAIN HIGH. 
WINDS WILL BECOME MORE SOUTHERLY. WILL HAVE TO BE CONCERNED WITH 
POSSIBLE CUBAN OUTFLOWS/CONVECTION. WILL STILL HOLD WITH LOW CHANCE 
POPS MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT ATTM.

TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK 
OVER THE KEYS AS LOWER PRESSURE MOVES FAR AWAY NORTH OF THE ISLANDS. 
SURFACE WINDS WILL REMAIN LIGHT...BUT DEEP MOISTURE WILL BE PRESENT 
OVER THE ISLANDS THROUGH ABOUT 500 MB. SEE NO REASON TO DEVIATE FROM 
POPS IN THE LOW CHANCE CATEGORY ATTM.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL EXTEND FROM THE BAHAMAS TO OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. THIS WILL RESULT 
IN NEAR NORMAL RAIN CHANCES WITH A LIGHT TO GENTLE TRADE FLOW. HAVE 
MADE NO CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED.

&&

.MARINE...LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS BETWEEN 5 AND 10 KNOTS ARE 
EXPECTED OVERNIGHT...BECOMING SOUTHWEST NEAR 10 KNOTS TOMORROW OVER 
THE GULF AND BAY WATERS...EXCEPT 10 TO 15 KNOTS OVER THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS. MARINERS WILL ENCOUNTER HIGHER SEAS AND ROUGH FLORIDA BAY 
WATERS WITHIN SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. SOME WIND GUSTS OVER

KNOTS AT 250 MB TRAVERSING THE ENTIRE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE CONUS. A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS PINCHING SOUTHWARD FROM THIS JET FROM NEBRASKA 
TO NORTH TEXAS. FARTHER TO THE SOUTHEAST...A WELL DEFINED YET COLD 
CORE MID AND UPPER CYCLONE IS SITUATED NEAR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. 
THE FLORIDA KEYS REMAIN BENEATH RATHER DRY CYCLONIC FLOW.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...A COLD FRONT 
EXTENDS FROM SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND SOUTHWEST TO NORTH TEXAS. A 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM 40N 40W 
SOUTHWEST TO THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST. TO THE SOUTH...A RATHER 
DISCOMBOBULATED AREA OF 1012 MB LOW PRESSURE IS LOCATED JUST EAST OF

PRESSURE COVERING A LARGE AREA. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN WEAK 
NEBULOUS BUT MOIST NORTH TO WEST FLOW ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE BROAD 
LOW PRESSURE AREA.  

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 900 AM...TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE LOW TO 
MID 80S...WITH DEWPOINTS INTO THE LOWER 70S. KEY WEST RADAR IS 
INDICATING JUST A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ATTM WITHIN 30 NM 
NORTH OF KEY WEST TO REBECCA SHOAL LIGHT. THE 12Z MORNING SOUNDING 
IS UNSTABLE WITH AMPLE MOISTURE BELOW 650 MB...AND HAS INCREASED 
FROM 1.45 INCHES PWAT (PRECIPITABLE WATER) LAST EVENING TO ALMOST 
1.8 INCHES...BUT 0 TO 6 KM STORM MOTION IS ONLY ABOUT 4 KNOTS FROM 
THE NORTH NORTHEAST. C-MAN SITES ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND IN 
SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE REGISTERING LIGHT AND VARIABLE 10 METER 
WINDS.
   
.FORECAST...TODAY AND TONIGHT...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...12Z 
MODELS ARE STILL INDICATING THAT THE UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE MOVING 
WEST OR WEST NORTHWEST TOWARDS CENTRAL OR SOUTH FLORIDA. SINCE THE 
SYSTEM WILL BE AT A REASONABLE DISTANCE FROM THE FLORIDA 
KEYS...FAIRLY DRY MID AND UPPER TROPOSPHERIC AIR WILL REMAIN AHEAD 
OF THIS SYSTEM  OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS.

IN THE LOWER AND MID LEVELS...LOW PRESSURE ANALYZED JUST EAST OF THE 
BAHAMAS MAY BECOME A BIT MORE ORGANIZED TODAY. THE LATEST AVAILABLE 
12 HR POP #S FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT ARE BETWEEN SLIGHT CHANCE AND LOW 
CHANCE. GIVEN SLOW DEVELOPMENT OF THE SYSTEM...WITH AMPLE DRY AIR IN 
THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...WILL HOLD WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AS THE LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES SLOWLY 
WEST OR NORTHWEST ACROSS THE BAHAMAS...BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS WILL 
CONTINUE THEIR BACKING TREND TO BETWEEN NORTH AND NORTHWEST...BUT 
SURFACE WINDS WILL BE VERY LIGHT. ONE CONCERN IS THAT GIVEN THE

353 AM EDT SAT JUN 24 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWS A DEEP... 
BUT WEAK AND SLOW-MOVING COLD-CORE CYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE EASTERN 
BAHAMAS. GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGERY REVEALS CONSIDERABLE MID- 
TROPOSPHERIC DRY AIR WITHIN AND SURROUNDING THIS SYSTEM. IN 
ADDITION...ATMOSPHERIC INSTABILITY IS QUITE WEAK ALONG THE NORTHERN 
AND WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE SYSTEM. THE WEAK WIND FIELDS...DRY 
AIR...AND WEAK INSTABILITY ENSURE THAT THE CONVECTION ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE SYSTEM IS QUITE LIMITED IN COVERAGE AND INTENSITY...AS 
OBSERVED IN SATELLITE IMAGES.

CURRENTLY...THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WEST OF THE SURFACE TROUGH WHICH 
RUNS NORTH-NORTHWEST FROM THE WINDWARD PASSAGE...ACROSS THE BAHAMIAN 
ISLES...TO THE CAROLINAS. A STRONG ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE IS SITUATED 
NORTH AND EAST OF THE SURFACE TROUGH...BUT SURFACE PRESSURE FIELDS 
ARE QUITE WEAK TO THE WEST OF THE TROUGH...INCLUDING OVER THE KEYS. 
WINDS ARE BLOWING FROM THE NORTH-NORTHEAST NEAR 5KT AT MOST STATIONS 
AROUND THE KEYS. AIR TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 80F AT MOST SITES WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. RECENT DOPPLER RADAR SCANS DETECT 
ISOLATED CONVECTIVE CELLS MOVING SOUTHWARD AT 5KT OVER THE GULF 
WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS AND ACROSS THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA 
SOUTH OF THE REEF BETWEEN SOMBRERO KEY AND SAND KEY.

FORECAST:
OUR PROGNOSIS IS FOR THE DEEP CYCLONE TO MOVE SLOWLY WEST AND 
NORTHWEST OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA DURING THE NEXT 48 HOURS. THE 
LOW-LEVEL WIND PROFILE ACROSS THE AREA WILL GRADUALLY BACK AS THE 
SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS PENINSULA. LIMITED INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE AND 
WEAK WIND FIELDS WILL LIMIT SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE... 
KEEPING 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES AROUND 30 PERCENT FOR ANY ONE LOCATION.

TODAY AND TONIGHT - THE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MEAN FLOW SHOULD BE FROM 
310/08KT BY THIS AFTERNOON...SO SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE MOVING 
TOWARD THE SOUTHEAST BY THAT TIME. THE UPPER KEYS COULD THEREFORE 
HAVE HIGHER RAINFALL COVERAGE DUE TO THEIR LOCATION DOWNSTREAM OF 
MIAMI-DADE COUNTY...BUT THIS IS OF COURSE UNCERTAIN AND WILL DEPEND 
ON SEVERAL FACTORS INVOLVING SEA-BREEZE EVOLUTION... MOISTURE...AND 
INSTABILITY.

SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT - THE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MEAN FLOW WILL 
LIKELY BACK FURTHER TO A WEST OR WEST-SOUTHWEST ORIENTATION... 
PERHAPS SLIGHTLY STRONGER BY A FEW KNOTS...SO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
STORMS WILL BE MOVING TOWARD THE EAST OR NORTHEAST. SURFACE WINDS 
WILL REMAIN NEAR OR BELOW 10KT OUTSIDE OF SHOWER AND STORM ACTIVITY.

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY - THE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MEAN FLOW WILL BACK 
FURTHER TO SOUTHWEST AND THEN SOUTH...AGAIN RIGHT AROUND 10KT. THIS 
MAY ALLOW A BETTER CHANCE FOR CUBAN SEA-BREEZE STORMS AND ASSOCIATED 
OUTFLOWS TO INFLUENCE LOCAL CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION. 
AGAIN...NUANCES IN LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL 
BE IMPORTANT IN DETERMINING EXACT LOCATION AND COVERAGE OF SHOWERS 
AND STORMS.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY - THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BUILD BACK WITH 
DEVELOPING EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW. CUMULUS LINES INDUCED BY KEYS... 
BAHAMAS...OR OCEANOGRAPHIC FEATURES WILL BE THE PRIMARY CONVECTIVE 
MODULATORS...AS WILL NUANCES IN MOISTURE/INSTABILITY FIELDS.
&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE BREEZES...MAINLY NEAR OR BELOW 10KT...AND AT TIMES VARIABLE 
IN DIRECTION...SHOULD PREVAIL THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY. THE ATLANTIC 
RIDGE SHOULD THEN SET UP NORTH OF THE KEYS BY WEDNESDAY WITH GENTLE 
EAST BREEZES DEVELOPING FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE SCATTERED IN COVERAGE...OCCURRING BOTH AT DAY 
AND AT NIGHT...WITH THE PRIMARY HAZARDS BEING LIGHTNING AND LOCALLY 
GUSTY WINDS AND HIGHER SEAS.
&&

.AVIATION...
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE LATER THIS MORNING...WITH MOST OF THE ACTIVITY EXPECTED OVER 
THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE. SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL PRODUCE 
PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR VIS AND/OR CIGS...WITH WIND GUSTS OF 30 TO 40 
KNOTS POSSIBLE. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH SHOULD AVERAGE LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE TO WEST NORTHWEST LESS THAN 10 KNOTS.

945 PM EDT FRI JUN 23 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE OFFSHORE 
WATERS WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY...AS WELL AS OVER THE GULF 
WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO 
PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE 
NORTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHEAST 
TO EAST NEAR 10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. ONLY ABOUT 
THREE DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO GENTLE NORTHEAST 
SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S. 

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT)...
A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ABOUT 200 MILES EAST OF THE NORTHERN 
BAHAMAS WILL SLOWLY MOVE TO THE WEST TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST 
SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE...BUT RELATIVELY DRY...WITH A PRECIPITABLE 
WATER (PWAT) VALUE JUST UNDER ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH.  
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN CONSTANT TONIGHT. DESPITE DRY AIR 
ENTRAINMENT...OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES OFF THE MAINLAND NEAR THE LOWER 
KEYS SHOULD BE ABLE TO PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT TO SUPPORT SLIGHTLY 
HIGHER POPS FOR THE LOWER KEYS TONIGHT. THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS 
FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...SO NO UPDATES ARE 
EXPECTED. 

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE NORTHEAST TO EAST SURFACE WINDS SHOULD SHIFT TO MORE OF A 
NORTHERLY DIRECTION TONIGHT. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS 
EXPECTED TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT WINDS MAY 
INCREASE SATURDAY NIGHT DEPENDING UPON THE EVOLUTION AND MOVEMENT OF 
LOW PRESSURE EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS.   

&&

.AVIATION...
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING WEST OFF THE MAINLAND ARE EXPECTED 
TO REMAIN NORTH OF KMTH AND KEYW TERMINALS THIS EVENING. AFTER 03Z 
ONLY ISOLATED CIRCUMNAVIGABLE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED 
ALONG THE KMIA TO KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN OUT OF THE 
NORTH OR NORTHWEST...330 TO 360 DEGREES...WITH SPEEDS LESS THAN 10 
KT. WINDS MAY BRIEFLY BECOME EASTERLY THIS EVENING...OUT OF 060 TO 
100 DEGREES...DUE TO COOL AIR FLOWING OUT FROM THE SHOWERS AND 
STORMS WEST OF CAPE SABLE.

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700-200 MB)...LATEST 
AVAILABLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...AND STREAMLINE ANALYSIS DEPICT A 
FAIRLY STRONG BRANCH OF THE JETSTREAM WITH 250 MB WINDS ZIPPING 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN CONUS NEAR 50 TO 75 KNOTS. MANY SMALL SCALE 
SHORTWAVES ARE EMBEDDED WITHIN THE FLOW. A WELL DEFINED UPPER LOW 
CIRCULATION REMAINS EAST OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. EVEN FARTHER 
SOUTH...A WELL DEFINED LARGE SCALE ANTICYCLONE IS CURRENTLY CENTERED 
OVER THE SOUTHWEST CARIBBEAN SEA. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN DRY 
AIR BENEATH ONLY ABOUT 600 MB. THIS IS ALONG THE OUTER PERIPHERY 
OF THE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TO THE EAST AND THE ANTICYCLONIC 
CIRCULATION TO THE SOUTH. INTERESTINGLY THE MORNING 12Z KEY WEST 
SOUNDING IS DEPICTING 1.73 INCHES OF PWAT(PRECIPITABLE 
WATER)...WHILST THE MIAMI SOUNDING IS ONLY ILLUSTRATING 1.12 INCHES.

IN THE LOW AND MIDDLE LEVELS...(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...1019 TO 1020 MB 
HIGH PRESSURE IS SITUATED FROM THE NORTHEAST TO THE GULF COAST. A 
LOW LEVEL WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM 35N 
50W WEST SOUTHWESTWARD TO CENTRAL FLORIDA. FARTHER TO THE SOUTH...A 
BROAD AREA OF LOWER PRESSURE IS SITUATED A COUPLE HUNDRED MILES 
NORTHEAST OF THE BAHAMAS. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE WITHIN A FAIRLY MOIST 
GENTLE TO MODERATE LOW LEVEL FLOW BETWEEN THE LOW TO THE EAST AND 
THE RIDGING TO THE NORTH. 

.CURRENTLY...AS OF 900 AM...TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE MIDDLE 
80S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MIDDLE 70S. THE 12Z...MORNING SOUNDING 
IS DEPICTING A BACKED...FAIRLY UNSTABLE...AND STILL MOIST PROFILE IN 
THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE. KEY WEST RADAR IMAGERY IS DEPICTING SCATTERED 
SHOWERS WITH ONLY A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS WITHIN 
60 NM SOUTH OF CRAIG KEY TO DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. WINDS OVER 
THE ISLANDS ARE MAINLY NORTHEAST NEAR 10 KNOTS...WHILE C-MAN 
STATIONS ARE REGISTERING 10 METER WINDS OVER THE REEF BETWEEN 9 AND 
12 KNOTS...WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 12 AND 15 KNOTS. 
   
.FORECAST...TODAY AND TONIGHT...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...UPPER 
LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE SLOWLY WESTWARD TOWARDS THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. 
A WEAK SHORTWAVE PRESENTLY IN THE NORTHERN CONUS JETSTREAM WILL 
QUICKLY AMPLIFY INTO A BROAD TROUGH OVER THE MIDWEST AND NORTHEAST 
U.S BY TONIGHT. ON THE REGIONAL SCALE...ADDITIONAL DRYING WILL OCCUR 
ABOVE 850 MB AS THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER LOW DEEPENS JUST A BIT AND 
MOVES WEST. AS A RESULT...ANY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT DO 
DEVELOP...WILL AT FIRST MOVE FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST...AND THEN 
FROM MAINLY NORTH TO SOUTH BY THE AFTERNOON.  

IN THE LOWER AND MID LEVELS...DISORGANIZED LOW PRESSURE TO OUR EAST 
WILL SLIDE SLOWLY TO THE NORTHWEST. AS A RESULT...BOUNDARY LAYER 
WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BACK AROUND TO NORTH. THIS WOULD SEEM TO NOT 
ALLOW THE EAST AND WEST COAST SEABREEZES THE ABILITY TO COLLIDE. 
OVER THE ISLANDS..THE BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW WOULD BE 
PERPENDICULAR...WHICH WOULD NOT FAVOR ENHANCED CUMULUS/TCU 
DEVELOPMENT.
 
LOOKING AT THE LATEST AVAILABLE RUN OF THE WRF...SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WERE INDICATED AT 13Z OVER THE 
STRAITS...WHERE THE DEEPER MOISTURE STILL REMAINS. LATEST AVAILABLE 
12 HOUR NAM AND GFS POPS FOR TODAY FOR EYW AND MTH IN IN THE ISLANDS 
ARE BETWEEN 10 AND 20 PERCENT...AND THESE NUMBERS HAVE PROVEN 
EXCEEDINGLY LOW FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS. WILL HAVE LOWER POPS TO 
LOW CHANCE FROM INHERITED GOOD CHANCE.

&&

.MARINE...WINDS CONTINUE TO BACK...WITH THE MAGNITUDE OF THE WIND 
REMAINS A SOLID 10 TO 15 KNOTS OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS. WILL REMOVE 
TRANSITIONAL WORDING AND INDICATE NORTHEAST WINDS ON ALL WATERS. 

&&

.AVIATION...FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...OUTSIDE OF 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...VFR CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED 
THROUGH THE BALANCE OF TODAY. OTHERWISE...NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
405 AM EDT FRI JUN 23 2006

.DISCUSSION...

ANALYSIS:
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING SHOWS AN 
UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC COLD-CORE CYCLONE NEAR THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS... 
WITH A WELL-DEFINED TROUGH DOWN TO THE SURFACE. THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE 
ALONG THE WESTERN EDGE OF THIS SYSTEM IN DEEP EAST TO NORTHEAST 
FLOW. CURRENT KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS DETECT SCATTERED TO 
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SERVICE 
AREA...WITH A MEAN CELL MOTION VECTOR OF 080/13KT. THE KEY WEST 
THURSDAY EVENING SOUNDING HAD SHOWN A MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
ATMOSPHERE WITH VERY LITTLE CONVECTIVE INHIBITION AND A LEVEL OF 
FREE CONVECTION ONLY 2500FT AGL. NUMEROUS BOUNDARIES OFF MAINLAND 
SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE BAHAMAS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO LIFT SURFACE PARCELS 
TO THE LFC EASILY WITH DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT APPARENTLY NOT A PROBLEM 
EITHER. THE GOES SOUNDER DETECTS DRIER TOTAL-COLUMN AIR JUST NORTH 
OF THE KEYS OVER PENINSULAR FLORIDA AND ADJACENT ATLANTIC AND GULF 
WATERS...BUT NUMERICAL MODEL ANALYSES INDICATE THAT MUCH OF THIS DRY 
AIR IS ABOVE 700MB.

FORECAST:
OUR PROGNOSIS IS FOR THE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE AND ASSOCIATED 
LOW-LEVEL TROUGH TO MOVE SLOWLY WEST-NORTHWESTWARD OVER THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA DURING THE NEXT 72 HOURS. AS A RESULT...THE WEATHER WILL 
REMAIN UNSETTLED IN THE FLORIDA KEYS WITH HIGHER THAN AVERAGE CLOUD 
COVER AND RAIN CHANCES. 

TODAY AND TONIGHT - ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL BE AROUND FOR 
MOST OF THE PERIOD...WITH HIGHEST SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE 
LIKELY IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...AS MAINLAND 
SEA-BREEZE CONVECTION AND ASSOCIATED OUTFLOWS MOVE SOUTH AND 
SOUTHWEST TOWARD THE ISLANDS.

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT - LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC WIND FLOW WILL 
GRADUALLY BACK FROM NORTH TO SOUTHWEST AS THE TROUGH MOVES 
WEST-NORTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. THIS WILL OBVIOUSLY 
CHANGE THE SHOWER/STORM MOTION VECTOR EACH DAY. SURFACE PRESSURES 
WILL BE LOWER THAN SEASONAL AVERAGES...AND CLOUD COVER AND RAIN 
CHANCES SHOULD REMAIN ABOVE AVERAGE ALSO.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY - THIS PERIOD WILL FEATURE THE GRADUAL 
REBUILDING OF AN ATLANTIC RIDGE...FIRST SOUTH OF THE SERVICE AREA 
EARLY IN THE WEEK...THEN SLOWLY SHIFTING NORTH TO A MORE 
CLIMATOLOGICAL POSITION ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. LOWER- 
TROPOSPHERIC FLOW WILL BACK FROM SOUTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST DURING THE 
PERIOD. A MOIST AND UNSTABLE TROPICAL AIR MASS ALONG WITH SOURCES OF 
LOW-LEVEL MESOSCALE LIFT IN CUBAN OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL ENSURE A 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AROUND THE CLOCK.
&&

.MARINE...
EAST BREEZES 10-15KT PREVAIL ACROSS THE WATERS ADJOINING AND 
SURROUNDING THE FLORIDA KEYS...AND THIS SHOULD PERSIST THROUGH THIS 
MORNING BEFORE WINDS TURN FROM A MORE NORTHEAST DIRECTION THIS 
AFTERNOON...SETTLING TO AROUND 10KT. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE AROUND FOR MOST OF THE DAY...WITH HIGHEST 
COVERAGE LATE THIS AFTERNOON OVER FLORIDA BAY AND GULF WATERS NORTH 
OF THE LOWER KEYS. PRIMARY THUNDERSTORM HAZARDS WILL BE LIGHTNING 
AND LOCALLY GUSTY WINDS.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KEYW TO KMIA TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
AFFECT THE ROUTE...PRODUCING LOCALIZED MVFR CONDITIONS AND A FEW 
BRIEF IFR VISIBILITIES IN STRONGER CELLS. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
SHOULD REMAIN SMALL ENOUGH SO AS TO BE CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. SURFACE 
WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE NORTHEAST TO EAST NEAR 10 KNOTS.
&&

.PRELIMINARY POINT TEMPS/POPS...
KEY WEST  88/76/88/76/87  50/50/40/40/40

DEPICT A FAIRLY STRONG BRANCH OF THE JETSTREAM WITH 250 MB WINDS 
ZIPPING ACROSS THE NORTHERN CONUS NEAR 50 TO 75 KNOTS. A DECENT 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH AXIS FROM MINNESOTA TO MISSOURI...WITH SOME 
ADDITIONAL ENERGY NEAR NORTH TEXAS AND NEW MEXICO MOVING EAST. A

KEY WEST RADAR IS DEPICTING JUST ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
KEY WEST RADAR DEPICTS JUST SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER FLORIDA

TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. 
WINDS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF ARE BETWEEN NORTH AND NORTHEAST NEAR 10 
KNOTS...WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 12 AND 15 KNOTS. 

.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(700 TO 200 MB)...IN THE MID

MODEL RUNS OF THE...NAM...GFS...UKMET...AND ECMWF MODELS ALL 
FORECAST THE SHORTWAVE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE OVER THE PLAINS TO 
AMPLIFY SUBSTANTIALLY INTO A DEEPER TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS BY 
SATURDAY MORNING...WITH THE SOUTHERN END OF THE TROUGHING OVER THE 
DEEP SOUTH THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE MODELS ALSO INDICATE THE WELL 
DEFINED UPPER LOW SHOULD MOVE WESTWARD TO OVER FLORIDA BY SUNDAY 
NIGHT...HOWEVER...THIS 12Z RUN IS AGAIN INCONSISTENT WITH THE LAST 
SEVERAL RUNS...WHICH HAD MOVED THE UPPER LOW MORE TO THE NORTHWEST. 
THE NET RESULT OF ALL OF THIS WILL BE CONTINUED INFLUX OVER THE AREA 
OF DRY AIR THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY NIGHT...UNTIL MORE MID AND 
UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE MOVES OVER THE ISLANDS FROM THE EAST ON SUNDAY 
AND SUNDAY NIGHT.

MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...MODELS ARE STILL INDICATING TROUGH OVER THE 
EASTERN THIRD OF THE U.S. WILL DEEPEN ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AND 
CONTINUE TO REMAIN AMPLIFIED ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD THROUGH 
FRIDAY...WITH ABUNDANT MIDDLE AND UPPER LAYER DRY AIR CONTINUING 
OVER THE ISLANDS.

IN THE LOWER LEVELS(SURFACE TO 700 MB)... MODELS CONTINUE TO EXHIBIT 
SOME CHALLENGES WITH THEIR RESPECTIVE SOLUTIONS FOR THE 1013 MB LOW 
EAST OF THE BAHAMAS. THIS LOW PRESSURE SHOULD MOVE MUCH MORE SLOWLY 
WESTWARD OR NORTHWESTWARD THAN ALL OF THE AVAILABLE MODELS ARE 
INDICATING...I.E (THE 12Z NAM...GFS...AND ECMWF. 

TONIGHT...FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE PRETTY DRY WITH THE BACKING 
BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW. THE 12Z NAM AND GFS 12 HOUR POPS FOR TONIGHT 
ARE BETWEEN 7 AND 21 PERCENT. WILL KEEP ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS 
IN THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT.

SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...THE 12Z GFS...NAM...AND UKMET BRING 
THE LOW PRESSURE OVER SOUTH FLORIDA BY LATE IN THE DAY...AND THAT 
SOLUTION WILL DISREGARDED ALMOST ENTIRELY. OF MORE CERTAINTY...THE 
LIGHT LOW LEVEL WINDS OVER THE KEYS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BACK WITH 
APPROACH OF THE SLOW MOVING LOWER PRESSURE TOWARDS THE WEST. WINDS 
WILL LIKELY BACK FROM NORTH TONIGHT BUT THE FLOW SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
BE LIGHT ENOUGH THAT I WILL STILL HOLD WITH JUST LIGHT AND VARIABLE 
WORDING FOR THE ZONES TOMORROW. DESPITE THE DRY AIR ADVECTING IN 
AHEAD OF THE LOW PRESSURE FROM THE EAST...ISLAND CUMULUS/TCU LINES 
ARE POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY IF THE BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW BACKS ENOUGH TO 
THE WEST BY LATE IN THE DAY...ALLOWING FOR A REVERSE CUMULUS LINE. 
THE 12Z 12 HOUR NAM AND GFS ARE INDICATING BETWEEN 25 AND 35 PERCENT 
THROUGH 00Z TOMORROW. WILL HOLD WITH LOW CHANCE POPS ATTM

SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...LOWER PRESSURE COULD BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO 
ALLOW FOR SLIGHTLY HIGHER RAIN CHANCES. IT COULD PASS BY TO THE 
NORTH OR NORTHEAST NEAR THE FLORIDA MAINLAND...AND WINDS SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO BACK TO SOUTHWEST...ALBEIT LIGHT. THIS 
DIRECTION...COMBINED WITH ENHANCED SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT...WOULD 
JUSTIFY EVEN SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS...AS A REVERSE CUMULUS LINE WOULD 
BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS.  

MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING WILL GRADUALLY 
REBUILD NORTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. THIS WILL ALLOW THE WINDS IN THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER TO RETURN TO BETWEEN EAST AND NORTHEAST. WILL HOLD 
WITH LOW CHANCE POPS ATTM. 

&&

.MARINE...WINDS WILL REMAIN LIGHT TO GENTLE THROUGH THE ENTIRE 
PERIOD...BUT WINDS AND SEAS MAY BE STRONGER IN GUSTY SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS LATE IN THE WEEKEND. WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BACK THROUGH 
TOMORROW NIGHT...WITH NORTH NORTHEAST WINDS BECOMING MAINLY NORTH 
TONIGHT...NORTHWEST TO WEST BY LATE TOMORROW...AND POSSIBLE WEST OR 
SOUTHWEST BY SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. LIGHT TO GENTLE NORTHEAST TO

.DISCUSSION...
SEVERAL CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE MOVED WEST OVER 
WATERS NORTH AND WEST OF THE KEYS OVERNIGHT...GENERALLY ALONG 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES LAID DOWN BY OFF-MAINLAND FLOW. SOME STORMS 
PASSED WITHIN 10 MILES NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS...WITH TOPS REACHING 
57 THSD FT. THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS NEAR NORTH FLORIDA 
PRODUCING AN ENE WIND FLOW OVER THE KEYS. OVERALL WINDS DID PICK UP 
A BIT AS ADVERTISED...RUNNING 10-15 KT AT C-MAN SITES. WATER VAPOR 
AND GOES SOUNDER IMAGES SHOW DRY AIR ALOFT OVER THE UPPER AND MIDDLE 
KEYS...THE STRAITS...AND PENINSULA TO OUR NORTH. 

.FORECAST...
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO ONGOING FORECAST PACKAGES. 
THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN THE NEAR TERM OVER SHOWER COVERAGE DUE TO 
FAVORABLE LOW LEVEL WIND FLOW VERSUS UNFAVORABLE DRY AIR ALOFT. IN 
THE LONGER TERM...THE DEVELOPMENT AND MOVEMENT OF WEAK LOW PRESSURE 
OVER THE ATLANTIC AND FLORIDA REMAINS A QUESTION. 

TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...I WILL DISCOUNT THE NAM MODELS 
CONTINUED AGGRESSIVE AND QUICK FORMATION OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE 
ATLANTIC WHICH IT BRINGS WEST TO FLORIDA...AFFECTING KEYS AREA WIND 
FLOW AS EARLY AS FRIDAY. OTHER MODELS INCLUDING THE GFS, UKMET, AND 
EUROPEAN GENERALLY INDICATE A MUCH WEAKER SURFACE TROUGH FORMATION 
OVER THE NW BAHAMAS REGION AROUND FRIDAY WHICH THEN EASES WEST OVER 
FLORIDA...PERHAPS AFFECTING AREA WIND FLOW FOR THE WEEKEND. 
MEANWHILE THEN...AN EAST-NORTHEAST SURFACE WIND FLOW IS EXPECTED TO 
PREVAIL OVER KEYS ISLANDS THROUGH FRIDAY...WHICH WILL AID DAYTIME 
OVER-ISLAND TCU DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER...MODELS ALL INDICATE 
CONSIDERABLE DRY AIR ABOVE 700 MB (10 THSD FT AGL) WHICH AT TIMES 
ENCROACHES DOWNWARD BELOW 700 MB. THE NAM MODEL SHOWS PERIODS OF 
DOWNWARD DRYING MOST PRONOUNCED AND AS A RESULT IS PRODUCING QUITE 
LOW 12 HOUR CHANCES OF RAIN...ONLY 20 AND 10 PCT FOR ALL PERIODS 
EVEN THROUGH SATURDAY. I WILL MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH ONGOING 30 
PCT POPS BUT THESE MAY BE A BIT HIGH. ANY SHOWERS THAT FORM NEAR THE 
SW FLORIDA MAINLAND SHOULD TEND TO MOVE SW OR SEND THEIR OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES THAT WAY...POSSIBLY AFFECTING SOME OF THE KEYS DURING 
EVENING HOURS WITH SECONDARY SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. 

SATURDAY-MONDAY...MOST MODELS BRING A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH OR WEAK 
LOW CENTER WEST OVER SOME PART OF FLORIDA...WITH THE KEYS IN A 
GENERAL WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN THAT MAY TEND TO GO WEST OR 
SOUTHWEST...OR VARIABLE. A DEEPER LAYER OF MOISTURE IS INDICATED FOR 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY IF THIS PATTERN COMES ABOUT...WHICH WOULD REQUIRE 
A BIT HIGHER CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THOSE DAYS. AT THIS TIME...NO LARGE 
SCALE LIFT REGIONS ARE SHOWN NEAR THE KEYS...AND EXTENDED GFS OUTPUT 
IS NOT ESPECIALLY HIGH ON 12-HOUR CHANCES OF RAIN.  

TUESDAY-WEDNESDAY...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IS SHOWN TO PUSH 
WEST AGAIN TO FLORIDA AS THE WEAK LOW PRESSURE CENTER OR TROUGH 
PASSES WEST AND NORTHWEST OF THE AREA. THIS WOULD TURN KEYS AREA 
WINDS BACK TO A GENERAL FLOW FROM THE EAST.
&&

.MARINE...
OVERALL KEYS AREA WINDS OUGHT TO REMAIN FROM THE ENE. SPEEDS MAY 
STAY IN THE 10-15 KT RANGE TODAY AND AT TIMES TONIGHT...BUT MAY COME 
DOWN CLOSER TO 10 KT FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT IF LOWER PRESSURE 
STARTS TO FORM NEAR THE N BAHAMAS. MODELS SUGGEST THAT LOWER 
PRESSURE WILL DRIFT WEST OVER FLORIDA THIS WEEKEND...AND THAT WOULD 
PUT THE KEYS IN A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN AND WINDS MAY BECOME 
VARIABLE BY SUNDAY...OR POSSIBLY GO AROUND TO SW...BUT WITH 
SUSTAINED SPEEDS STILL 10 KT OR LESS. WATCH FOR GUSTY WINDS NEAR ANY 
THUNDERSTORMS OF COURSE.

EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON...A CLOUD LINE GENERATED A FEW SHOWERS OVER 
THE WESTERNMOST LOWER KEYS ALONG WITH A FUNNEL CLOUD TO THE 
NORTHEAST OF BOCA CHICA. CURRENTLY...DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT IS 
DISSIPATING THE AFOREMENTIONED CLOUD LINE...LEAVING MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN AND SURROUNDING WATERS. LATEST SURFACE

THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
BOTH GFS/NAM AND UKMET KEEP SIGNIFICANT MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
DIFFLUENCE/VORTICITY ADVECTION OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WELL 
NORTHEAST OF OUR REGION. BECAUSE OF THE PERSISTENT MID AND UPPER 
LEVEL CYCLONIC FLOW...ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SPIN DOWN A SURFACE 
REFLECTION...WITH A GRADUAL WESTWARD TRACK TO NEAR THE FLORIDA EAST 
COAST BY SATURDAY NIGHT. BY FAR...NAM CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST 
AGGRESSIVE AND EVEN SPAWNS ANOTHER SURFACE FEATURE FURTHER 
EASTWARD...WHILE GFS IS THE FURTHEST NORTH. REGARDLESS...AMPLE 
MOISTURE...MODERATE INSTABILITY AND A RATHER FAVORABLE LOW LEVEL

CLIMO POPS AND AVERAGE TEMPERATURES INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
BOTH GFSLR AND ECMWF ARE CONSISTENT WITH THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE 
BUILDING ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...RESULTING IN A DEEPENING AND 
INCREASING MOIST EASTERLY FLOW. SUBSEQUENTLY...THIS WOULD FAVOR A 
LATE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING PRECIPITATION REGIME. FOR NOW...WILL 
KEEP AVERAGE POPS AND TEMPERATURES.

.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE AXIS NOW EXTENDS WEST OVER NORTH FLORIDA. 
THERE ARE SOME QUITE WEAK SOUTH-TO-NORTH ORIENTED TROUGHS EMBEDDED 
WITHIN THE OVERALL EASTERLY FLOW COMING ACROSS THE BAHAMAS AND SOUTH 
FLORIDA...GIVING SOME VARIABILITY OF WINDS IN THE KEYS BETWEEN EAST 
AND NORTHEAST. SPEEDS A LOCAL GAUGES ARE NEAR 10 KT. A HIGH LEVEL 
(300-200 MB) LOW AND TROUGH THAT WERE ABOUT OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS 24 
HOURS AGO HAVE SHIFTED EAST AND NOW ARE OVER THE WESTERN BAHAMAS. AS 
A RESULT...LARGE CONVECTIVE CLUSTERS THAT HAVE BEEN OCCURRING EAST 
OF THE TROUGH AXIS HAVE SHIFTED E AND NE OVER ATLANTIC WATERS EAST 
OF THE BAHAMAS. MOISTURE REMAINS PLENTIFUL OVER THE KEYS AT LEVELS 
FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 10 THSD FT AGL OR SO. SINCE MIDNIGHT...RADAR 
HAS SHOWN AN INCREASE IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON WATERS NORTH 
AND WEST OF THE KEYS...ALONG LOW LEVEL BOUNDARIES. SOME 
NEWLY-DEVELOPED SHOWERS ARE PRESSING WEST OVER THE LOWER KEYS AS 
WELL. 

.FORECAST...
GFS AND NAM MODELS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP A SURFACE LOW OVER THE 
ATLANTIC NE OF THE BAHAMAS...WITHIN AN AREA OF PERSISTENT HIGH LEVEL 
DIVERGENCE N AND E OF THE 250 MB LOW CENTER. THE NAM SEEMS VERY 
QUICK AND OVERDONE...BRINGING A SURFACE LOW INTO EXISTENCE BY 18Z 
TODAY. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE UKMET AND EUROPEAN MODELS JUST 
DEVELOP A GENERAL TROUGHINESS OVER THE NW BAHAMAS BY AROUND FRIDAY 
AND DRIFT IT NW OVER FLORIDA SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. 

FORTUNATELY THE GFS AND NAM MODELS DEVELOP THEIR RESPECTIVE SURFACE 
LOWS FAR ENOUGH NE AND N OF THE BAHAMAS SO THAT...IF SUCH LOW 
DEVELOPMENT OCCURS OUT THERE...IT WOULD NOT DIRECTLY AFFECT THE 
KEYS. ON THE OTHER HAND...SHOULD SLOWER AND LESS AGGRESSIVE TROUGH 
FORMATION OCCUR OVER THE NW BAHAMAS AROUND FRIDAY AS DEPICTED BY THE 
EUROPEAN AND UKMET MODELS...AND THEN MOVE TO FLORIDA SAT AND SUN... 
IT WOULD PORTEND HIGHER CHANCES OF RAIN FOR THE KEYS THIS WEEKEND. 

IN THE MEANTIME...
TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...A NE TO E WIND FLOW OVER A DEEP LAYER OF THE 
LOWER TROPOSPHERE (SURFACE TO 700 MB) OUGHT TO AID DAILY TCU/CB 
FORMATION OVER OR NEAR KEYS ISLANDS. MODELS DO INDICATE SOME DAILY 
FLUCTUATIONS IN THE TOP OF THE MOIST LAYER...NOTABLY THE GFS MODEL 
DIPS A BIT OF DRYING DOWNWARD BELOW 700 MB THU AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. BUT ON THE WHOLE...FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE SUFFICIENT 
LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE FOR SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM FORMATION IF 
TRIGGERS ARE AVAILABLE. LINGERING MESOSCALE BOUNDARIES MAY AGAIN AID 
SHOWER FORMATION AT NIGHT. MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS FOR CHANCE OF 
PRECIP SEEM RATHER LOW FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. I WILL KEEP THE 
ONGOING 40 PCT FOR TODAY...30 PCT FOR PERIODS THEREAFTER. 

SATURDAY-TUESDAY...THIS EXTENDED PERIOD IS UNCERTAIN DUE TO POSSIBLE 
ATLANTIC LOW PRESSURE FORMATION OR PERHAPS TROUGH FORMATION NEAR THE 
BAHAMAS AND FLORIDA.

.MARINE...
A GENERAL NE TO E WIND FLOW NEAR 10 KT IS STILL EXPECTED TO STICK

KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE EAST AT 
5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHEAST TO EAST AT 5

DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO LIGHT EAST SURFACE 
WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT)...
IN THE LOW LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA TONIGHT. IN THE MID LEVELS 
OF THE ATMOSPHERE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TONIGHT. IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE

WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUE JUST UNDER TWO INCHES. 
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD DECREASE TONIGHT. BY SUNRISE 
WEDNESDAY...PWAT VALUES SHOULD BE NEAR ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN

KEY WEST SOUNDING INDICATES A STEERING FLOW THAT IS NORTH OF EAST...
SO ANY CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS IN THE FLORIDA STRAITS TONIGHT WILL 
EITHER MOVE SOUTH OF THE KEYS OR WILL HAVE TO CROSS SOUTH FLORIDA 
BEFORE MAKING IT TO THE KEYS. IT IS HIGHLY UNLIKELY THAT CONVECTION

ASSOCIATED WITH SEVERAL CUMULUS LINES. HOWEVER...VISIBLE IMAGERY 
SHOWS A CUMULUS LINE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING ALONG MARATHON...EXTENDING 
WESTWARD TOWARDS BIG PINE. WITH AMPLE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY 
PRESENT...REGENERATING A CUMULUS LINE ALONG THE LOWER KEYS THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING IS A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY. UPDATED THE 
ZONES THIS MORNING TO REFLECT INCREASED CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.

TONIGHT...SHOULD BE A BOUNDARY RICH ENVIRONMENT IN THE VICINITY OF 
THE KEYS LATE INTO THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE 
POPS.

TOMORROW...THE 12Z GFS RUN HAS BACKED AWAY FROM DEVELOPING A SURFACE 
FEATURE IN THE BAHAMAS...SO THEREFORE THE FORECAST LOW LEVEL WINDS 
ARE MORE EASTERLY THAN IN PREVIOUS RUNS. THE 12Z NAM/WRF IS STILL 
MAINTAINING A STRONG SURFACE TROUGH IN THE BAHAMAS...WHICH WILL KEEP 
OUR WINDS NORTHEASTERLY. THE NAM/WRF SOLUTION WOULD BE MUCH MORE 
FAVORABLE FOR CUMULUS LINE DEVELOPMENT ORIENTED ALONG THE LOWER KEYS 
THAN THE GFS SOLUTION. GIVEN THE DIFFLUENCE WITH THE UPPER LEVEL 
TROF PARKED OVER THE BAHAMAS AND VICINITY...AND THE LOW AND MID 
LEVEL INSTABILITY...THERE IS LITTLE QUESTION THAT CU LINES WILL 
FORM. THE FORECAST PROBLEM IS THE ORIENTATION OF THOSE LINES AND 
WHETHER THEY IMPACT THE ISLANDS OR STAY OVER OPEN WATER. WILL KEEP 
MIDDLE CHANCE POPS WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS.

THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THE NAM/WRF DEVELOPS A SURFACE LOW IN THE 
BAHAMAS AND MOVES THIS FEATURE TOWARDS NORTHEAST FLORIDA INTO FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THE GFS KEEPS AN OPEN TROUGH IN THE VICINITY OF THE 
BAHAMAS...AND IS SLOWER IN MOVING THIS FEATURE TOWARDS FLORIDA INTO 
SUNDAY...MAINTAINING IT AS A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH. THE GFS SOLUTION 
IS SIGNIFICANTLY MOISTER THAN THE NAM/WRF SOLUTION FOR THE FLORIDA 
KEYS...WITH IPWV VALUES NEAR TWO INCHES BY FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP

.DISCUSSION...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE AXIS NOW EXTENDS WEST OVER NORTH FLORIDA. 
IN THE WIND FIELD IT IS EASY TO ANALYZE A WEAK SOUTH-TO-NORTH TROUGH 
ALONG THE COAST FROM NEAR THE UPPER KEYS TO CAPE CANAVERAL. 
MEANWHILE...WATER VAPOR AND IR SATELLITE LOOPING SHOWS A HIGH LEVEL 
TROUGH FROM JUST EAST OF MIAMI SW ALONG AND JUST ABOUT OVERHEAD OF 
THE KEYS (FLOW OF CIRRUS ELEMENTS IDENTIFY THIS HIGH LEVEL FEATURE). 
THE SWATH OF DRY AIR ALOFT THAT WAS SEEN MOVING WEST TO THE KEYS 
THIS TIME 24 HOURS AGO...IS NOW DEPARTING WEST FROM THE KEYS WITH 
SOME HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ENCROACHING FROM THE EAST. 
ISOLATED SHOWERS,  AND EVEN A BRIEF SMALL THUNDERSTORM ON FLORIDA 
BAY, HAVE FORMED OVER KEYS NEARSHORE WATERS SINCE MIDNIGHT. HARD TO 
EXPLAIN IS A LONG-LIVED CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT 
MOVED WEST OFF THE SW FLORIDA MAINLAND LATE LAST EVENING...AND HAS 
TRAVELED TO WATERS JUST NORTH OF DRY TORTUGAS AT THIS TIME...ALL THE 
WHILE PROGRESSING THROUGH THE SWATH OF DRY AIR ALOFT. KEYS AREA 
WINDS ARE FROM THE EAST AT THIS TIME...RIGHT AT 10 KT AT MARINE WIND 
GAUGES. 

.FORECAST...
LATEST RUNS OF THE GFS AND NAM MODELS BOTH EXHIBIT QUESTIONABLE LOW 
PRESSURE AREAS OR TROUGHS FORMING OVER OR EAST OF THE BAHAMAS 
THROUGH NEXT FRIDAY...WITH THE GFS MOVING SOME OF THESE SURFACE 
TROUGHS WEST OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. UKMET AND EUROPEAN 
MODELS HAVE NO SUCH INDICATIONS THROUGH FRIDAY...AND THOSE SMOOTHER 
MODELS WILL BE FOLLOWED. HOWEVER...EXTENDED PERIODS OF THE GFS, 
UKMET, AND EUROPEAN MODELS ALL INDICATE A GENERAL WEAK TROUGH AREA 
FORMING OVER THE WESTERN BAHAMAS TO FLORIDA DURING SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY. 

TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY...MODELS INDICATE THAT THE SHARP 250 MB TROUGH 
NOW OVER THE KEYS WILL SWING TO THE EAST AND THAT A WEAK REFLECTION 
OF THIS HIGH LEVEL TROUGH DOWN TO THE 500 MB LEVEL WILL REMAIN OVER 
OR EAST OF THE BAHAMAS. THUS...A LARGE AREA OF DISORGANIZED...BUT AT 
TIMES STRONG...THUNDERSTORM CLUSTERS SHOULD ALSO REMAIN EAST OF THE 
KEYS OUT OVER THE BAHAMAS AND ATLANTIC. THE GFS MODEL SEEMS TO 
SUFFER FROM CONVECTIVE PROBLEMS (A HUGE BLOW-UP OF 700 MB OMEGA 
FIELDS IS SEEN NE OF THE BAHAMAS AT 18Z TODAY)...AND AS A RESULT THE 
GFS FORMS A SURFACE TROUGH OUT THERE WHICH IT THEN MOVES WEST OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT WITH ENHANCED 
PRECIPITATION. MEANWHILE THE NAM SPINS UP A LOW PRESSURE AREA 
BETWEEN THE BAHAMAS AND BERMUDA. I WILL MAINTAIN WIND AND PRECIP 
FIELDS CONSISTENT WITH THE UKMET AND EUROPEAN MODELS THROUGH THIS 
TIME PERIOD...WITH A NE TO E WIND FLOW NEAR 10 KT CONTINUING. 
THE VERY DRY AIR ABOVE 850 MB IS EXPECTED TO MOISTEN UP OVER LEVELS 
FROM THE SURFACE TO 700 MB...PROVIDING ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR AFTERNOON 
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO FORM OVER OR NEAR THE KEYS 
ISLANDS...THANKS TO A FAVORABLE ENE LOWER LEVEL WIND FLOW. AT 
NIGHT...BOUNDARIES IN THE NE TO E WIND FLOW MAY FOCUS SOME SHOWERS.
30 PCT POPS WILL BE RETAINED FOR ALL PERIODS. 

FRIDAY NIGHT-MONDAY...AS STATED ABOVE...VARIOUS LONGER RANGE MODELS

1050 PM EDT MON JUN 19 2006

.DISCUSSION...
EXTENSION OF DRY AIR ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA HAS LIMITED RADAR 
ECHOES IN THE SERVICE AREA MOST OF THIS EVENING. THE EXCEPTION HAS 
BEEN A CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PULLING INTO THE 
NORTHERN GULF WATERS OVER THE PAST HOUR OR SO. ANOTHER LARGER...BUT 
WEAKENING AREA...IS SLOWLY DRIFTING NEAR OUR NORTHEASTERN ATLANTIC 
ZONES. DISCERNABLE BOUNDARIES TRAVERSING THE AREA GIVE ENOUGH REASON 
TO KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE 
OVERNIGHT AREA. THE AFTERNOON ZONE FORECAST IS STILL IN FINE SHAPE. 
TEMPERATURES ARE NOT EXPECTED TO DROP FAR FROM THEIR PRESENT 
READINGS. THE LATE EVENING MARINE UPDATE BACKED THE WINDS SLIGHTLY 
IN THE BAY AND GULF WATERS OVERNIGHT. WIND SPEEDS LOOK GOOD.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KEYW TO KMIA TWEB ROUTE. 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE ENTIRE 
ROUTE...BUT WILL BE CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. SHORT LIVED MVFR/IFR CIGS AND 
VIS ARE POSSIBLE WITHIN ANY SHOWERS AND STORMS. MOVEMENT WILL BE 
TOWARDS THE WEST NEAR 8 KNOTS.

MR/AF
====================================================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
KEY WEST RADAR ALMOST COMPLETELY FREE OF PRECIPITATION RETURNS 
WITHIN THE WARNING AREA...A MUCH DIFFERENT ENVIRONMENT THAN THE PAST 
TWO DAYS...AND ALSO AN INDICATION THAT DRY AIR IS WINNING THE DAY. 
THEREFORE THE ONLY REALISTIC CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION OVER THE 
ISLANDS WOULD COME FROM CUMULUS LINE DEVELOPMENT. SOUTHEASTERLY 
WINDS FROM 10 TO 15 KNOTS HAVE PERSISTED ALL MORNING...BUT OVER THE 
LAST TWO HOURS LONG KEY AND MOLASSES REEF HAVE BECOME MORE EASTERLY 
AND WEAKENED BELOW 10 KNOTS. SOMBRERO KEY LIGHT HAS ALSO DROPPED 
BELOW 10 KNOTS...ALTHOUGH STILL MEASURING WINDS FROM JUST SOUTH OF 
EAST. THIS CERTAINLY COULD BE A RESPONSE TO THE THERMAL TROUGH ON 
THE MAINLAND. IF THAT IS THE CASE THEN THERE STILL MAY BE A LOWER 
KEYS CUMULUS LINE LATER THIS AFTERNOON.  

TONIGHT...CUMULUS LINE CONVECTION AND SHOWERS...IF GETTING A LATE 
START...COULD STRETCH INTO THE EARLY EVENING. OTHERWISE...THERE ARE 
ENOUGH BOUNDARIES IN THE VICINITY TO INITIATE NOCTURNAL ISOLATED 
SHOWER ACTIVITY IN DIFFLUENT FLOW OVER THE STRAITS...WITH A FEW OF 
THESE SHOWERS POTENTIALLY CROSSING THE KEYS. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE 
OVERNIGHT.

TOMORROW THROUGH FRIDAY...BOTH THE 12Z NAM AND GFS INDICATE 
FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR CUMULUS LINE DEVELOPMENT TOMORROW AND 
WEDNESDAY...WITH SURFACE WINDS NORTHEASTERLY AND LIGHT THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS. BOTH DAYS THE NAM IS SOMEWHAT DRIER THAN THE 
GFS...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES FROM 0.1 TO 0.3 INCHES 
LOWER...BUT BOTH SHOW ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO 
SUPPORT SHOWERS. ALSO...THE NAM AND GFS DEVELOP A WEAK SURFACE 
FEATURE IN THE VICINITY OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. THE GFS DEVELOPS A 
SURFACE LOW AND MOVES THIS TOWARDS THE PENINSULA...PLACING AN OPEN 
TROUGH OVER THE PENINSULA FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THE NAM KEEPS THE 
FEATURE WEAK AND MOVES IT OFF TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST. NEITHER 
SOLUTION...AS CURRENTLY REPRESENTED IN THE MODELS...WILL MAKE MUCH 
DIFFERENCE IN THE KEYS.

SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...TROUGHINESS STRETCHING FROM THE NORTHERN 
GULF COAST ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD TO NEW ENGLAND WILL COMPETE 
WITH RIDGING BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHEAST FROM THE ATLANTIC. WITHOUT 
CONSIDERING TRANSIENT TROPICAL FEATURES IN THE EASTERLY FLOW...THE 
KEYS AND COASTAL WATERS SHOULD BE IN RELATIVELY LIGHT FLOW AND 
PERSISTENT DEEP MOISTURE. WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS THROUGHOUT THE 
FORECAST PERIOD.
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE GENERALLY BELOW ADVISORY CONDITIONS AND 
EASTERLY FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. MAIN THREAT TO THE MARINE 
COMMUNITY WILL BE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS AND WATERSPOUTS ALONG 
CUMULUS LINES.
&&

.AVIATION...
OUTSIDE OF ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH BRIEF MVFR/IFR 
CONDITIONS FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...VFR WILL PREVAIL.

1015 AM EDT MON JUN 19 2006

.DISCUSSION...
KKEY 12Z SOUNDING REVEALS A SIGNIFICANTLY DRIER AND LESS UNSTABLE 
ATMOSPHERE THAN THIS TIME YESTERDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES HAVE 
DROPPED ABOUT A HALF INCH AND INSTABILITY PARAMETERS HAVE TRENDED 
DOWN. FSL GPS BASED PRECIPITABLE WATER IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE 
SOUNDING WITH VALUES IN THE 1.5 INCH RANGE. THE DRIER AIR OVER SOUTH 
FLORIDA SHOULD LESSEN MAINLAND CONVECTION...WHICH HAS SHROUDED US IN 
CIRRUS THE PAST TWO DAYS. YESTERDAYS WINDS WERE NORTHERLY FROM ABOUT 
20K FEET UP...WHEREAS THIS MORNINGS SOUNDING IS MORE EASTERLY 
ALOFT...WHICH SHOULD KEEP MAINLAND CIRRUS FROM INVADING THE KEYS 
EVEN IF CONVECTION OVER THE MAINLAND DOES DEVELOP. THIS WILL MEAN 
MORE SUNSHINE AND HEATING ALONG THE KEYS...WITH TEMPERATURES MAYBE A 
DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. WITH THE UNOBSTRUCTED 
SUNSHINE...FORECAST QUESTION OF THE DAY IS WHETHER A CUMULUS LINE 
DEVELOPS ALONG THE LOWER KEYS. WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
PENINSULA...A THERMAL TROUGH OVER THE PENINSULA WILL SERVE TO BACK 
WINDS SOMEWHAT NORTH OF EAST. IF THIS OCCURS THEN THERE CERTAINLY IS 
ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO SUPPORT SHOWERS ALONG THE CU LINE. GIVEN THE 
ABOVE...SEE NO REASON TO CHANGE THE SLIGHT CHANCE MENTIONED IN THE 
MORNING ZONES. 
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS OVER CMAN AND ISLAND STATIONS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY SOUTH 
SOUTHEAST...WITH CMAN STATIONS BETWEEN 10 AND 15 KNOTS. THIS IS 
CONSISTENT WITH THE COASTAL WATER FORECAST IN PLACE...AND WILL BE 
MAINTAINED IN THE MORNING UPDATE. MARINE CONCERN TODAY IS THE 
OUTSIDE CHANCE OF WATERSPOUT DEVELOPMENT ALONG CUMULUS 
LINES...MAINLY IN THE LOWER KEYS.
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...MOSTLY VFR CONDITIONS 
WILL BE FOUND THROUGH AT LEAST EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A SHORT 
SPELL OF WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS DURING MID AFTERNOON 
UNTIL ACTIVITY MIGRATES WESTWARD OUT OF THE ROUTE CORRIDOR. 
OTHERWISE...MOSTLY EAST WINDS OF 12 KNOTS OR LESS CAN BE ANTICIPATED 
AT THE KEY WEST AND MARATHON TERMINALS...WITH A VICINITY SHOWER 
POSSIBLE DUE TO CLOUD LINE FORMATION.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
345 AM EDT MON JUN 19 2006

.DISCUSSION...
A LARGE SURFACE RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE NW ATLANTIC EXTENDING FROM A 
MODEST 1024 MB HIGH CENTER WELL OFFSHORE FROM CAPE HATTERAS...THENCE 
WSW OVER THE SE U.S. AND ALONG THE NORTHERN GULF COAST. THIS RIDGE 
STILL DRIVES THE LOCAL KEYS PRESSURE GRADIENT...BUT A REMNANT 
THERMAL TROUGH MAY BE LINGERING ALONG THE FLORIDA WEST COAST...AND 
THIS IS STILL INFLUENCING LOCAL KEYS WINDS TO VARY FROM DUE EAST TO 
NORTHEAST. WIND SPEEDS ARE NEAR 10 KT AT ISLAND, REEF AND BAY 
SITES...ALTHOUGH THE C-MAN IN DRY TORTUGAS HAS BEEN RUNNING 12 KT. 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEEN ISOLATED FOR THE MOST PART SINCE 
MIDNIGHT ON KEYS WATERS WITH NO DISCERNIBLE ORGANIZATION. GOES 
SOUNDER AND WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CONTINUE TO DEPICT AN UPPER LEVEL 
CYCLONIC CIRCULATION TAKING SHAPE JUST NE OF THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. 
RELATIVELY NARROW SWATHS OF ALTERNATING MOIST AND DRY AIR ALOFT ARE 
SEEN IN THE GOES SOUNDER AND WATER VAPOR LOOPS SWIRLING WEST AND 
SOUTHWEST ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE UPPER CIRCULATION. ONE SWATH OF 
DRY AIR ALOFT COVERS THE AREA FROM THE EXTREME NW BAHAMAS AND THE SE 
COAST OF THE FLORIDA MAINLAND...SOUTH TO JUST EAST OF THE UPPER AND 
MIDDLE KEYS. GOES SOUNDER INDICATES PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES OF 
ABOUT 1.40 INCH IN THIS AIRMASS. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
HAVE BEEN OCCURRING ON THE WEST AND SOUTH EDGES OF THIS DRIER AIR 
ALOFT...BUT NOT MUCH HAS BEEN DETECTED ON RADAR OVER THE NW BAHAMAS 
UNDER THE BULK OF THE SWATH. 

.FORECAST...
THERE WILL BE A BALANCING ACT BETWEEN A LOW LEVEL WIND PROFILE THAT 
IS FAVORABLE FOR OVER-ISLAND AFTERNOON SHOWER DEVELOPMENT...AND 
DRIER AIR ALOFT THAT WILL TEND TO THWART TCU/CB BUILD-UPS TODAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY...ALTHOUGH A LITTLE MORE DEPTH TO THE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IS SEEN TO SET IN TUESDAY AFTERNOON. DEEPER MOISTURE IS 
INDICATED FOR MOST PERIODS FROM WEDNESDAY ONWARD. 

TODAY-TONIGHT...THE SWATH OF DRIER AIR ALOFT IS FORECAST BY MODELS 
TO SWING WEST OVER THE KEYS TODAY...BRINGING THE DRIER AIR DOWN INTO 
LEVELS BETWEEN 850 MB AND 700 MB. THE 1000-700 MB RELATIVE HUMIDITY 
FIELDS IN THE MODELS BEST FIT THE DRYNESS ALOFT PATTERN CURRENTLY 
SEEN IN BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS...AND THESE BRING THAT DRIER 
SWATH OVER THE KEYS BY THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. 20 PCT POPS WILL 
BE RETAINED THEREFORE. FOR THE LOWER-MOST KEYS...THE AFTERNOON LOW 
LEVEL WINDS FORM THE ENE SHOWN IN ALL MODELS SUGGESTS THAT THOSE 
ISLANDS MAY HAVE A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE OF SOME BUILD-UPS. 

TUE...NAM KEEPS THE SAME DRYNESS OVERHEAD OF THE KEYS...WHILE THE 
GFS SHOWS A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE DEPTH BY END OF DAY. AGAIN...
ENE LOW LEVEL WINDS MAY SET IN GIVING LOWER KEYS SOME HELP WITH 
AFTERNOON TCU DEVELOPMENT. 20 PCT POPS MAY BE APPROPRIATE...BUT I 
WILL STAY WITH CONTINUITY OF 30 PCT FOR NOW DUE TO GFS INDICATIONS. 

TUE NIGHT-SUN...THE SURFACE RIDGE IS FORECAST BY MODELS TO LIE MUCH 
OF THE TIME ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA IN A SLIGHTLY WEAKER STATE...WITH 
INDICATIONS THAT AT TIMES THERMAL TROUGHING OVER THE PENINSULA WILL
TEND TO TURN SOME KEYS AREA WINDS TO NE. ALSO...GFS IS TENDING TO 
PROMOTE A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE BAHAMAS WHICH...IF IT 
OCCURS...WOULD TEND TO GIVE SOME ENE OR NE WINDS TO THE KEYS. 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD...GFS SHOWS PLENTIFUL MOISTURE FROM THE SURFACE 
UP TO 700 MB. THERE MAY BE A DAILY BUILD-UP OF TCUS AND ISOLATED 
CBS OVER OR NEAR THE KEYS ISLANDS...SO 30 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN WILL 
BE MAINTAINED FOR EACH DAY. NIGHT TIME RAIN CHANCES MAY VARY BETWEEN 
20 AND 30 PCT...HARD TO NAIL DOWN BOUNDARY TENDENCIES. 

.MARINE...
THE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE SHOULD KEEP KEYS AREA WINDS COMING 
MAINLY FROM THE EAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...NEAR 10 KT OVER GULF, BAY, 
AND NEAR ISLANDS BUT PROBABLY MORE IN THE 10-15 KT RANGE OUT IN THE 
STRAITS OF FLORIDA. FLORIDA BAY MAY PICK UP A SEA BREEZE NEAR THE 
MAINLAND COAST...10 KT OR SO BLOWING ONSHORE. NOT A LOT OF CHANGE IS 
INDICATED FOR KEYS AREA MARINE WINDS...EXCEPT THAT WE MAY SEE NE OR 
ENE DIRECTIONS AT TIMES FROM TUESDAY ON THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH SPEEDS 
10 KT OR SO ON MOST WATERS. WATCH FOR ISOLATED SHOWERS ANYTIME...
BUT SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM BUILD-UPS MAY BE MORE PRONE NEAR ISLANDS
DURING THE AFTERNOONS FROM TUESDAY ONWARD INTO THE WEEK. 
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
AND AT THE KEYS TERMINALS. THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS 
MORNING...ISOLATED MVFR SHOWERS ARE ANTICIPATED ACROSS THE ROUTE. 
THIS AFTERNOON WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL DEVELOP ALONG SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES IN SOUTH FLORIDA...AND 
POSSIBLY ALONG CLOUD LINES NEAR THE LARGER KEYS. SOME OF THE SOUTH 
FLORIDA CONVECTION IS THEN EXPECTED TO PUSH INTO THE GULF AND BAY 
WATERS ADJOINING THE FLORIDA KEYS THIS EVENING. SURFACE WINDS AWAY

.DISCUSSION...
KBYX RADAR HAS BEEN RELATIVELY QUIET IN THE IMMEDIATE AREA OVER THE 
PAST COUPLE OF HOURS...WITH ECHOES REMAINING WELL TO THE NORTH OF 
OUR GULF WATERS. MORE RECENT ECHOES HAVE DEVELOPED JUST EAST OF OUR 
ATLANTIC WATERS AND THERE HAS BEEN A SLOW EXPANSION OF CUBAN ECHOES 
TOWARDS THE STRAITS RECENTLY. WINDS ARE LIGHT AND MOSTLY OUT OF THE 
EAST TO NORTHEAST. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. SKIES ARE 
MOSTLY...BUT ARE THINNING CLOSE TO THE ISLAND CHAIN. LATE EVENING 
SOUNDING SHOWS SLIGHTLY MORE INSTABILITY THAN YESTERDAY EVENING AND 
A STEERING FLOW VEERED MORE TO THE E/SE. CANT RULE OUT THE CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD...SO NO UPDATE TO THE 
AFTERNOON ZONE FORECAST IS PLANNED. LITTLE IF ANY CHANGE IS EXPECTED 
ON THE LATE EVENING MARINE UPDATE.

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB 
ROUTE AND AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. JUST ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED. ANY SHOWERS 
OR STORMS WILL REMAIN CIRCUMNAVIGABLE AND WILL PRODUCE TEMPORARY 
MVFR AND IFR CONDITIONS. SURFACE WINDS WILL BE FROM THE EAST BETWEEN 
8 AND 10 KNOTS.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL IMAGERY SHOWS AN UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC CYCLONE 
SPINNING OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC EAST OF NEW ENGLAND. A COLD 
TROUGH EXTENDS SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THIS CYCLONE TO THE BAHAMAS AND 
SOUTH FLORIDA. A SPRAWLING LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC ANTICYCLONE COVERS 
MUCH OF THE SUBTROPICAL NORTH ATLANTIC...WITH A RIDGE EXTENDING WEST 
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. CURRENTLY...DEEP...BUT WEAK 
EAST-SOUTHEAST FLOW PREVAILS OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS AND ADJOINING 
WATERS. THE BOUNDARY LAYER IS MOIST WITH FAIRLY HIGH RELATIVE 
HUMIDITIES UP TO ALMOST 700MB...AND THE ATMOSPHERE IS MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE OVERALL. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE 
BEEN AROUND MUCH OF THE DAY...WITH CONVECTIVE INITIATION NOT A 
PROBLEM WHERE LOW-LEVEL BOUNDARIES HAVE BEEN AVAILABLE. SHORT-LIVED 
ORDINARY CELLS HAVE PREDOMINATED...WITH FAST-RISING HIGH- 
REFLECTIVITY CORES NOT MAKING IT MUCH PAST THE FREEZING LEVEL BEFORE 
DROPPING BACK DOWN. SUBSEQUENTLY...LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE OCCURRED 
ON OCCASION WITH THE STRONGEST CELLS...BUT FREQUENT OR CONTINUOUS 
LIGHTNING ACTIVITY HAS BEEN ABSENT THUS FAR. CURRENT CELL MOTION PER 
WSR-88D SCANS IS ABOUT 100/08KT. CLOUD COVER HAS BEEN ABUNDANT DUE 
TO NORTHERLY FLOW IN THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE TRANSPORTING ANVIL 
MATERIAL SOUTHWARD FROM HIGHER CELL COVERAGE OVER AREAS NORTH OF THE 
KEYS. 

THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN WILL CHANGE LITTLE OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS. A LARGE LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC ANTICYCLONE 
WILL BE THE GOVERNING FEATURE...WITH THE RIDGE REMAINING NORTH OF 
THE KEYS...WITH FEW VACILLATIONS...THROUGH THE UPCOMING WEEK. 
BOUNDARY-LAYER MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN SEASONABLY MOIST... 
HOWEVER...THERE WILL LIKELY BE SOME VARIATIONS IN WATER VAPOR 
CONTENT IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE FROM 925-700MB...AND THIS WILL HELP 
MODULATE CONVECTIVE CELL COVERAGE. CURRENTLY...SOME DRIER AIR IN THE 
925-700MB LAYER IS DETECTED BY THE GOES SOUNDER AND INITIALIZED BY 
NUMERICAL MODELS UPSTREAM OVER THE BAHAMAS. THIS SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR 
WILL LIKELY MOVE ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. IN 
ACKNOWLEDGEMENT...WE HAVE NUDGED 12-HOUR RAIN CHANCES DOWNWARD TO 20 
PERCENT.

FOR TUESDAY THROUGH NEXT SUNDAY...THE FORECAST IS VERY MUCH NEAR 
CLIMATOLOGY. ALL INDICATIONS POINT TO THE ATLANTIC RIDGE REMAINING 
NORTH OF THE KEYS...WITH A TROPICAL AIR MASS FIRMLY IN PLACE IN DEEP 
EASTERLY FLOW. LOCAL VARIATIONS IN RAINFALL WILL DEPEND ON NUMEROUS 
MESOSCALE FACTORS THAT COALESCE UNIQUELY EACH DAY...SUCH AS 
LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC WATER VAPOR CONTENT AND WIND FLOW ORIENTATION AND 
SPEED. SYNOPTIC-SCALE LIFTING MECHANISMS WILL BE LACKING...OR ARE 
INDISCERNIBLE IN THE PROGNOSIS AT THIS POINT...AS THE MIDLATITUDE 
STORM TRACK HAS LIFTED WELL NORTH AND THE TROPICAL WAVE TRAIN 
REMAINS WELL SOUTH AND INACTIVE AT THE MOMENT.
&&

.MARINE...
MODERATE EAST BREEZES WILL PERSIST TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT... 
THEN TURN GENTLE BY TUESDAY AS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE MOVES A LITTLE 
CLOSER. GENTLE EAST BREEZES WILL THEN PERSIST THROUGH THE END OF THE 
WEEK. SCATTERED SHOWER COVERAGE TONIGHT WILL GIVE WAY TO ISOLATED 
ACTIVITY MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AS SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR BRIEFLY 
FILTERS INTO THE LOW LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE. TYPICAL SCATTERED 
SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE IS THEN EXPECTED FROM TUESDAY 
THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND.
&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WILL PERSIST OVER THE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1030 AM EDT SUN JUN 18 2006

.DISCUSSION...
THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING REVEALED MOIST CONDITIONS IN THE LOWER 
TROPOSPHERE WITH WEAK WINDS THROUGHOUT THE DEPTH OF THE ATMOSPHERE. 
A MODERATELY UNSTABLE STRATIFICATION WAS PRESENT WITH A MLCAPE OF 
1542 J/KG. WEAK GEOPOTENTIAL HEIGHT FALLS HAD OCCURRED DURING THE 
LAST 24 HOURS...OWING TO AN UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
MIGRATING SOUTH-SOUTHWESTWARD OVER THE REGION. SLIGHT COOLING IN THE 
MID TROPOSPHERE HAS ALSO STEEPENED MID-LEVEL LAPSE RATES A BIT. 
MODERATE BUOYANCY AND WEAK SHEAR SUPPORT SHORT-LIVED ORDINARY 
CONVECTIVE CELLS...AND THIS IS THE CONVECTIVE MODE CURRENTLY 
OBSERVED ON DOPPLER RADAR SCANS. MEAN CELL MOTION IS FROM ABOUT 
105/09KT...AND OBSERVATIONS OF CLOUD ELEMENTS IN VISIBLE SATELLITE 
IMAGES UPSTREAM REVEAL A STRONGER FLOW FROM THE EAST-SOUTHEAST.

THE CURRENT FORECAST OF SCATTERED SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY FOR THIS AFTERNOON IS SOUND. ISLAND RAINFALL LOCATIONS WILL 
BE QUITE RANDOM IN NATURE...DEPENDING ON WHERE OCEANIC BOUNDARIES 
SET UP...EVOLVE...AND INITIATE CONVECTION. CHECK THE LATEST SHORT 
TERM FORECASTS FOR A HIGHER DEGREE OF FORECAST TEMPORAL AND SPATIAL 
DETAIL IN THE SHORT RANGE.
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS EARLY THIS MORNING RANGE FROM EAST-SOUTHEAST 5-10KT OUT BY THE 
DRY TORTUGAS AND GULF WATERS WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE...TO 10-15KT 
OFF THE UPPER KEYS. WINDS AND SEAS WILL BE HIGHER AND MORE VARIABLE 
IN AND NEAR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WILL PERSIST OVER THE 
MAINLAND PORTION OF THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI AVIATION ROUTE THROUGH 
EARLY EVENING...DIMINISHING AFTER SUNSET. ALONG THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
ISLAND TERMINALS OF KEY WEST AND MARATHON...VFR CONDITIONS WILL 
PERSIST...WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS PRODUCING 
OCCASIONAL MVFR AND IFR VISIBILITIES. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM 
CONVECTIVE OR DIURNAL CIRCULATIONS WILL GENERALLY BE GENERALLY 
SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 10 KNOTS.

310 AM EDT SUN JUN 18 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT 
THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. 
WINDS OVER LAND ARE EAST NEAR 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE 
EAST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. ONLY 
ABOUT SIX DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO GENTLE EAST 
SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE TAIL END OF AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER SOUTH 
FLORIDA WILL MOVE OVER THE KEYS TODAY. THIS TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE 
MAY BE RESPONSIBLE FOR SOME UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE IN THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY...WHICH MAY ENHANCE RAIN CHANCES. MIDDLE OF THE ROAD 
CHANCE POPS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR TODAY. THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL WEAKEN TONIGHT AS THE PARENT LOW PRESSURE AREA OFF THE 
NEW ENGLAND COAST BEGINS TO ACCELERATE NORTHWARD. IN THE LOW LEVELS 
OF THE ATMOSPHERE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TONIGHT INTO MONDAY. THIS 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT SOUTHWARD MONDAY 
AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY. ALTHOUGH THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF 
ATMOSPHERIC INSTABILITY AND ADEQUATE ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE FOR 
CONVECTION TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT WILL 
LIMIT POPS TO LOW CHANCE CATEGORY AT BEST. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA 
TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES SHOULD BE 
NEAR ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
SATURDAY. EASTERLY FLOW IS EXPECTED FROM THE SURFACE TO AT LEAST 10 
KFT TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY. FORECAST CHALLENGES TUESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY WILL BE PRIMARILY SHORT TERM IN NATURE DUE TO 
MESOSCALE MECHANISMS AT PLAY EACH DAY AND NIGHT. AS A RESULT...THERE 
WILL BE NO CHANGES TO THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS 
FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

&&

.MARINE...
AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES TODAY AND TONIGHT...BEFORE SHIFTING 
SOUTHWARD TO NORTH FLORIDA MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. NO ADVISORIES OR 
CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
SCATTERED MVFR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED IFR THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE 
MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE WILL DIMINISH IN NUMBER THROUGH THE 
REMAINDER OF THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...THE LULL WILL LAST ONLY A FEW 
HOURS AS WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
EXPECTED TO AGAIN DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. OVER SOUTH FLORIDA THIS 
DEVELOPMENT WILL BE ALONG SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES. MOST OF THE HEAVIER 
ACTIVITY SHOULD BE WEST OF THE MIAMI METROPLEX DUE TO AN EASTERLY 
STEERING FLOW. ACROSS THE KEYS PORTION OF THE ROUTE...DEVELOPMENT 
WILL BE ALONG CLOUD LINES NEAR THE LARGER KEYS. SOME OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES AND SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO PUSH INTO KEYS GULF WATERS 
THIS EVENING...SUSTAINING SCATTERED SHOWERS THROUGH THIS EVENING 
MAINLY OVER THE SOUTHWEST HALF OF THE ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM 
BOUNDARIES AND CONVECTION WILL GENERALLY BE EASTERLY AT AROUND 10 
KNOTS.

.DISCUSSION...
KBYX RADAR HAS A CLUSTER OF SHOWERS...WITH A FEW EMBEDDED 
THUNDERSTORMS...MOVINNG SLOWLY SOUTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE FLORIDA BAY 
AND GULF WATERS. LATE EVENING LOCAL SOUNDING SHOWS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
PRECIPITABLE WATER AND A BIT MORE INSTABILITY COMPARED TO THIS TIME 
YESTERDAY...SO A CHANCE POP WILL BE MAINTAINED THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD IN THE ZONES. IR SATELLITE SHOWS A RATHER THICK SHIELD OF 
CLOUDS MOVING OVERHEAD FROM EARLIER ACTIVITY OVER THE SOUTHWEST 
COAST. WITH CURRENT ACTIVITY...EXPECT A CONTINUATION OF MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT. AWAY FROM LOCATIONS THAT RECEIVE RAIN 
OVERNIGHT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD NOT MOVE VERY FAR FROM THEIR PRESENT 
READINGS. NO ZONE UPDATE IS PLANNED. THE COASTAL WATERS FORECAST 
FROM THIS AFTERNOON IS IN FINE SHAPE...NO ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE 
INCORPORATED INTO THE LATE EVENING UPDATE.

.AVIATION...
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL IMPACT THE FLIGHT ROUTE FROM 
MIAMI TO KEY WEST. MOST OF THE ACTIVITY WILL BE CONFINED TO THE OVER 
WATER PORTION OF THE ROUTE (60SW KMIA-KEYW). PERIODS OF MVFR/IFR 
CONDITIONS POSSIBLE WITHIN ANY CIRCUMNAVIGABLE SHOWERS OR STORMS. 
MOVEMENT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE NEARLY TO THE SOUTHWEST AT 5 
KNOTS.

====================================================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
RECENT MEASUREMENTS FROM DOPPLER VAD WIND PROFILERS OUT OF MIAMI AND 
KEY WEST INDICATE THAT THE WIND FLOW HAS BACKED TO EAST-NORTHEAST IN 
THE 5000-20000FT AGL LAYER. MID-AFTERNOON ACARS SOUNDINGS CONCUR. 
CURRENTLY...SHOWER COVERAGE IS ISOLATED ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA... 
ALTHOUGH CLOUDS ARE PLENTIFUL OWING TO A CB ANVIL-LEVEL NORTHERLY 
FLOW. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ERUPTED OVER MAINLAND 
SOUTH FLORIDA BETWEEN LAKE OKEECHOBEE AND CAPE SABLE. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS ARE DETECTED AROUND THE KEYS. 

DEEP-LAYER ANTICYCLONIC FLOW GOVERNS THE LARGE SCALE AT PRESENT... 
WITH A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED JUST OFF THE CAROLINA 
COAST...AND MOVING EASTWARD. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL MIGRATE OVER 
THE AREA ON SUNDAY...WITH PERHAPS A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE OF RAIN 
THEN.

EASTERLY FLOW WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TO GOVERN IN THE LOWER 
TROPOSPHERE THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE WEEK...WITH MOIST CONDITIONS IN 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER...AND A WEAKLY TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
STRATIFICATION. AS SUCH...CLIMO POPS ARE WARRANTED...AND FORECAST 
CHALLENGES WILL PRIMARILY BE SHORT-RANGE IN NATURE DUE TO THE 
PREPONDERANCE OF MESOSCALE MECHANISMS AT PLAY EACH DAY AND NIGHT.
&&

.MARINE...
A PERIOD OF MODERATE EAST BREEZES IS LIKELY TONIGHT AS A SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OF MODERATE STRENGTH MOVES OFF THE CAROLINA 
COASTLINE FARTHER OUT OVER THE WESTERN NORTH ATLANTIC. IN THE SHORT 
TERM...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE TOWARD 
THE WEST-SOUTHWEST AT 5-10KT...AFFECTING SOME OF THE NEARSHORE 
WATERS AROUND THE LOWER KEYS...FLORIDA BAY...AND THE GULF WATERS 
WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY. A FEW WATERSPOUTS ARE POSSIBLE AS 
WELL. SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA... 
PARTICULARLY TOWARD DAYBREAK.

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS SHOWS A DEEP LAYER MEAN 
ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE SYSTEM TILTS 
NORTHEASTWARD WITH HEIGHT...AND AT THE SURFACE...A 1025MB HIGH 
PRESSURE CELL WAS CENTERED OVER THE CAROLINAS AT 12Z. AS A 
RESULT...EASTERLY FLOW PREVAILS OVER THE KEYS FROM THE SURFACE TO 
ABOUT 700MB...THEN BACKS TO NORTHERLY AT 500MB...AND NORTHWESTERLY 
AT 200MB. THE KEY WEST MORNING SOUNDING REVEALED A MOIST BOUNDARY

CONVECTIVE INHIBITION. KEY WEST DOPPLER RADAR SCANS INDICATED 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS EARLIER THIS MORNING... 
BUT COVERAGE HAS RECENTLY DECREASED TO ISOLATED. 

THE SFC-700MB LAYER MEAN FLOW ON THE MORNING SOUNDING WAS FROM 
105/12KT...AND THIS ORIENTATION IS LIKELY TO PERSIST THROUGH THE

FOR TODAY LOOKS MORE REASONABLE...SO LOW CHANCE POPS TODAY SHOULD BE 
DRIVEN BY CLOUD LINES EMANATING FROM THE BAHAMAS. HIGH PRESSURE 
SHOULD EXPAND OVER THE NORTHWESTERN ATLANTIC TONIGHT. THERE MAY BE A 
BRIEF WIND SURGE...ESPECIALLY ON ATLANTIC WATERS TONIGHT. AN UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE SHOULD FORM OVER THE BAHAMAS TONIGHT. 
THIS DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE MAY HELP TO 
ENHANCE LOW TOPPED NOCTURNAL SHOWERS MOVING WESTWARD OVER THE 
FLORIDA STRAITS TONIGHT. LOW CHANCE POPS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR 
TONIGHT...WHICH IS NEAR OR ABOVE ALL NUMERICAL MODEL OUTPUT 
STATISTICS. THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE BAHAMAS 
SHOULD BEGIN TO MOVE WESTWARD SUNDAY. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL 
GUIDANCE DEPICTS SOME LIFT OVER THE KEYS SUNDAY...ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE. THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL 
OUTPUT STATISTICS INDICATES LIKELY POPS FOR SUNDAY. THIS IS PROBABLY 
OVERDONE...BUT THIS SOLUTION CANNOT BE TOTALLY DISCOUNTED. AS A 
RESULT...FORECASTED CLOUDS AND POPS WILL BE INCREASED FOR SUNDAY. AN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN 
UNITED STATES SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. LOW CHANCE POPS WILL BE 
MAINTAINED FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...WHICH IS NEAR ALL NUMERICAL 
MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THE AFOREMENTIONED ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SHIFT 
SOUTHWARD MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
FRIDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES SHOULD BE NEAR ONE AND THREE 
QUARTERS OF AN INCH MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. NO CHANGES TO THE 
LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

&&

.MARINE...
AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CAROLINAS TODAY WILL MOVE INTO THE 
NORTHWEST ATLANTIC AND EXPAND TONIGHT. THERE MAY BE A BRIEF WIND 
SURGE ON ATLANTIC WATERS TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. SMALL CRAFT 
CAUTIONARY CRITERIA (15 TO 20 KNOT WINDS AND/OR 6 FOOT SEAS) ARE 
POSSIBLE ON ATLANTIC WATERS TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING IF HIGH 
PRESSURE EXPANDS MORE THAN EXPECTED. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY NIGHT...BEFORE SHIFTING SOUTHWARD TO NORTH 
FLORIDA MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY 
STATEMENTS ANTICIPATED SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH AT LEAST WEDNESDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
THE MAIN IMPACTS TO AVIATION ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT 
ROUTE WILL BE ISOLATED IFR THUNDERSTORMS AND MVFR SHOWERS THROUGH 
THE REMAINDER OF THIS MORNING. THIS AFTERNOON SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH 
EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FOCUSED ALONG SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES 
OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE 
EXPECTED ALONG CLOUD LINES EMANATING FROM THE LARGER KEYS. SURFACE 
WINDS AWAY FROM CONVECTIVE OR DIURNAL CIRCULATIONS WILL GENERALLY BE 
EASTERLY AT AROUND 10 KNOTS.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
1000 PM EDT FRI JUN 16 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A THINNING STRIP OF DEBRIS CLOUDS FROM A WEAKENING CLUSTER OF 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OFF THE SOUTHWEST SECTION OF THE MAINLAND IS 
CROSSING THE UPPER KEYS. OTHERWISE THE SERVICE AREA IS MOSTLY CLEAR 
ACCORDING TO LATE EVENING IR IMAGES. WEAKER RADAR ECHOES ARE JUST 
NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS AND ISOLATED RETURNS ARE NOTED OVER THE 
EASTERN STRAITS. THE LATE EVENING LOCAL SOUNDING INDICATES PWAT 
ELEVATED ABOVE THIS MORNING OR 24 HOURS AGO...BUT OTHER THAN SOME 
DRIFTING BOUNDARIES AND A WEAK MID-LEVEL VORT LOBE PASSING BY...SEE 
NOTHING TO SUPPORT MORE THAN ISOLATED COVERAGE OF 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT. WILL HAVE A ZONE UPDATE OUT SHORTLY 
TO ACCOUNT FOR SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS. TEMPERATURES WILL NOT DROP MORE 
THAN A DEGREE OR TWO FROM THEIR PRESENT READINGS. THE LATE EVENING 
COASTAL WATERS UPDATE WILL HAVE NO CHANGES.

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW 
FLIGHT ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS. ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE ALONG THE ROUTE...BUT 
ANY SHOWERS OR STORMS WILL REMAIN CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. BRIEF MVFR/IFR 
CIGS AND VIS POSSIBLE IN ANY SHOWER OR STORM. MOVEMENT OF THIS 
ACTIVITY WILL BE TO THE SOUTHWEST OR 220 DEGREES NEAR 8 KNOTS. 
SURFACE WINDS OVERNIGHT WILL VEER BACK AROUND TO BETWEEN EAST AND 
SOUTHEAST NEAR 10 KNOTS.

MR/DAF
====================================================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
A WEAK BOUNDARY...MARKING THE LEADING EDGE OF A HIGH PRESSURE 
SURGE...EXTENDS WEST OVER THE ATLANTIC TO JUST SOUTH OF CAPE 
CANAVERAL. THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM FOLLOWING THIS MILD SURGE IS 
CENTERED OVER VIRGINIA AT THIS TIME. MEANWHILE...A WEAK NE TO E WIND 
FLOW STILL PREVAILS OVER THE KEYS...WHILE SEA BREEZE CIRCULATIONS 
HAVE ALREADY DOMINATED SURFACE FLOW OVER THE SOUTHERN MAINLAND. 
WATER VAPOR AND IR SATELLITE DATA STILL INDICATE A SE MOVING SHORT 
WAVE TROUGH ALOFT...WHOSE AXIS SWINGS W INTO FLORIDA PERHAPS NEAR 
LAKE OKEECHOBEE AT THIS TIME. THUNDERSTORMS HAVE JUST STARTED TO 
FORM ON SEA BREEZES...AND IN SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA NEAR AND SOUTH OF 
THE SURFACE AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH POSITIONS. A TCU LINE HAS FORMED 
OVER THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS WITH SOME NEW SHOWERS NOW OCCURRING...
WHILE A SHOWER THAT DRIFTED SW OFF CAPE SABLE INTO FLORIDA BAY IS 
NOW PRODUCING LIGHTNING.

.FORECAST...
TONIGHT...A LINGERING CHANCE OF SHOWERS/SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD LAST AT LEAST THROUGH EVENING DUE TO TCU/CB 
DEVELOPMENT IN CLOUD LINES OVER THE KEYS...MIGRATION OF 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OR THEIR OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM THE MAINLAND 
INTO KEYS WATERS...AND PERHAPS SOME AID OF THE PASSING UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH IN SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. A 30 PCT POP THIS EVENING 
EQUALS OR EXCEEDS MOS GUIDANCE. SURFACE WINDS OUGHT TO BE CLOSE TO 
EAST AFTER LATE DAY EFFECTS OF MAINLAND SEA BREEZES SUBSIDE. 
HOWEVER...LATEST MODELS ARE SLOWER TO SHOW RISING PRESSURES BRINGING 
IN THE BOOST IN WIND SPEEDS.

SAT...THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA CURRENTLY MOVING OVER THE SE STATES...
IS STILL FORECAST BY ALL MODELS TO BECOME CENTERED OFFSHORE FROM THE 
U.S. EAST COAST...WHILE BEGINNING TO EXPAND IN SIZE AND CENTRAL 
PRESSURE. IF IT TURNS OUT THAT WINDS OVER THE KEYS DONT START TO 
INCREASE TONIGHT...MODELS ARE MORE DEFINITIVE ABOUT A BOOST IN EAST 
WIND SPEEDS OVER THE KEYS SATURDAY...WITH 10-15 KT WINDS BY 
AFTERNOON. GFS MODEL INDICATES A SLIGHT MOISTURE MAX OVER THE KEYS 
SAT MORNING...AS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS IS JUST DEPARTING FROM 
OVERHEAD AND MOVING SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST. THE WIND PROFILE DOES NOT 
APPEAR HIGHLY FAVORABLE FOR AFTERNOON TCU/CB ALIGNMENT OVER THE KEYS 
ISLAND CHAIN...BUT 30 PCT POPS WILL BE RETAINED BASED ON THE MORNING 
MOISTURE AND PROXIMITY OF THE UPPER PASSING TROUGH AXIS.

SAT NIGHT-MON NIGHT...A PERIOD OF NICE EAST BREEZES IS IN STORE FOR 
THE ISLANDS...BUT FLORIDA STRAITS WATERS MIGHT GET A LITTLE TOO 
ROUGH FOR SOME SMALL CRAFT. THE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH SHOULD 
KEEP A STEADY 10-15 MPH WIND BLOWING...BUT MODELS SUGGEST THERE 
MIGHT BE A LITTLE HIGHER PEAK OF WINDS SAT NIGHT INTO SUN NIGHT. SEE 
MARINE SECTION. 30 PCT CHANCE OF RAIN EACH PERIOD IS DUE MAINLY TO 
SMALL SCALE SHOWER MAKERS...SUCH AS CLOUD LINES OFF THE BAHAMAS AND 
NOCTURNAL ENHANCEMENT. MEANWHILE...A LARGE HIGH LEVEL CYCLONE (250 
MB) IS FORECAST TO FORM OVER THE BAHAMAS SUNDAY WITHIN A SHARPENING 
TROUGH...WHICH IS THEN FORECAST TO RETROGRADE WEST OVER FLORIDA BY  
MONDAY. GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT A SLIGHT REFLECTION OF THIS HIGH 
LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEVELOP DOWNWARD TO THE 500 MB LEVEL...WHICH WILL 
MOVE WEST OVER THE KEYS MON AND MON NIGHT. A SLIGHT UVV FIELD IS 
SHOWN WITH THIS FEATURE. 30 PCT POPS CONTINUE.

TUE-FRI...SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT IS EXPECTED TO SLACKEN JUST A 
BIT TUE AND WED BUT WITH A DEEP EAST FLOW STILL INTACT FROM THE 
SURFACE UP TO 700 MB. ABUNDANT MOISTURE IN THIS LOWEST 10 THSD FT 
MAY PROVIDE NIGHT AND MORNING SHOWERS...30 PCT...BUT NO STRONG OR 
WELL DEFINED RAIN-TRIGGERS ARE SEEN AT THIS TIME. 
&&

.MARINE...
WATCH FOR OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES...WIND GUSTS...LIGHTNING...AND MAYBE 
SOME WATERSPOUTS THIS EVENING AS SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
FORM NEAR THE KEYS...AND ALSO MOVE SOUTHWEST OFF THE MAINLAND. 
HIGH PRESSURE IS STILL EXPECTED TO EXPAND OVER THE NW ATLANTIC BY 
SATURDAY...BOOSTING AREA WINDS INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE...ALTHOUGH 
THIS MIGHT START LATER TONIGHT ON STRAITS WATERS. IN GENERAL...EAST 
WINDS 10-15 KT WILL BE WITH US ON THROUGH MONDAY...BUT THERE IS SOME 
THREAT THAT WIND SPEEDS COULD BE RIGHT AROUND 15 KT SAT NIGHT INTO 
SUN NIGHT IF THAT HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BALLOONS OUT JUST A LITTLE 
STRONGER. A GRADUAL DROP IN WINDS CLOSER TO 10 KT...STILL FROM THE 
EAST...IS EXPECTED TUE AND WED.
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 12Z. LATE 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES ACROSS SOUTH 
FLORIDA. SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY WILL MIGRATE INTO THE GULF AND BAY 
WATERS NORTH OF THE KEYS AND REACH PORTIONS OF THE LOWER KEYS EARLY 
THIS EVENING...DUE TO A LIGHT EAST NORTHEAST STEERING FLOW. IN 
ADDITION...THE LOWER TROPOSPHERIC WIND PROFILE WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR 
CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. SHOWERS AND 
STORMS ALONG THE ROUTE AND AT THE TERMINALS WILL PRODUCE PERIODS OF 
MVFR TO IFR CIGS AND/OR VIS. MOST OF THE SHOWER AND STORM ACTIVITY 
WILL ABATE LATER THIS EVENING. SURFACE WINDS AT THE KEYS TERMINALS 
WILL BE FROM THE EAST TO SOUTHEAST AROUND 5 KNOTS LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND SHIFT TO THE EAST NORTHEAST THIS EVENING AT 5 TO 10 
KNOTS.

A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE AXIS IS STILL IDENTIFIABLE IN THE PRESSURE 
FIELD EXTENDING WEST JUST SOUTH OF GRAND BAHAMA ISLAND TO THE SOUTH 
FLORIDA PENINSULA. THIS IS DRIVING KEYS AREA WINDS FROM THE NE TO E 
AT 5-10 KT...EXCEPT SPEEDS ARE CLOSER TO 10 KT OUT IN THE STRAITS 
AND TO THE SOUTH BASED ON A 12Z SHIP OBSERVATION. THE LOCAL AIRMASS 
CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT PRECIPITABLE WATER OF 1.75 INCH...DUE TO LOWER 
LEVEL MOISTURE DESPITE SOME DRYNESS AT AND ABOVE THE 10 THSD FT 
LEVEL. SATELLITE (ESPECIALLY WATER VAPOR IMAGERY) SHOWS A WELL 
DEFINED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SWINGING SE OVER THE ATLANTIC EAST OF 
FLORIDA...WITH SCATTERED CLUSTERS OF THUNDERSTORMS ALONG AND AHEAD 
OF THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS. ONE CLUSTER IS ABOUT TO MOVE OVER GRAND 
BAHAMA ISLAND. 

.FORECAST...
NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS...WITH AN UPDATE 
SCHEDULED TO FRESHEN TIME REFERENCES. DURING THE HEAT OF THE DAY...
THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND OUGHT TO DEVELOP SEA BREEZES AGAIN...
AND THE KEYS ISLANDS HEAT MAY FORM TCUS AND POSSIBLE SHOWERS OVER 
OR NEAR THE ISLANDS. THE WESTERN EXTENSION OF THE UPPER LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE TROUGH AXIS NOW MOVING THIS WAY OVER THE ATLANTIC MAY SWING 
OVER OR CLOSE TO SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
THIS MAY ENHANCE SOME OF THE SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. WE WILL 
NEED TO WATCH FOR STORM MOVEMENT AND/OR OUTFLOWS FROM THE MAINLAND 
TOWARD THE KEYS.

STRAITS TO THE SOUTH MAY PICK UP INTO THE 10-15 KT RANGE. FLORIDA 
BAY AREAS NEAR THE MAINLAND WILL BE AFFECTED BY SEA BREEZES. WATCH 
FOR ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 24Z. THIS

A FEW BRIEF SHOWERS TEMPORARILY REDUCING VIS TO MVFR. THIS 
AFTERNOON...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD 
DEVELOP ALONG SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA. SOME OF 
THIS ACTIVITY WILL MIGRATE INTO THE GULF AND BAY WATERS ADJOINING 
THE FLORIDA KEYS...DUE TO A LIGHT EAST NORTHEAST STEERING FLOW. IN 
ADDITION...THE LOWER TROPOSPHERIC WIND PROFILE WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR 
CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT ALONG A PORTION OF THE KEYS. THIS WILL LIKELY 
RESULT IN ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NEAR AND DOWNSTREAM OF

A RELATIVELY WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND ACROSS 
NORTH FLORIDA TODAY AND TONIGHT. THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF MOISTURE 
FROM THE SURFACE TO 10 KFT TO SUPPORT CONVECTION TODAY AND TONIGHT. 
THE STEERING FLOW SHOULD BE NORTHEAST OR NORTHEAST TO EAST AT AROUND 
10 KNOTS THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH MAY ENABLE A LOWER KEYS ISLAND 
CUMULUS CLOUD LINE TO SIT OVER THE LOWER KEYS. IN ADDITION...THE 
STEERING FLOW MAY ALLOW FOR OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM SEA BREEZE 
CONVECTION TO WORK THEIR WAY TOWARD THE KEYS THIS EVENING. LOW 
CHANCE POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. 
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES SHOULD MOVE INTO THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC SATURDAY. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
EXTEND ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY. MODERATE EAST BREEZES SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WILL BE 
COUPLED WITH PLENTIFUL MOISTURE FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH 10 KFT. 
RAIN CHANCES SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WILL BE DRIVEN BY CLOUD LINES 
EMANATING OFF THE BAHAMAS...AS WELL AS LOW TOPPED NOCTURNAL SHOWERS. 
LOW CHANCE POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
WHICH IS NEAR THE MAJORITY OF NUMERICAL MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS.   

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
THE AFOREMENTIONED ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SHIFT 
SOUTHWARD MONDAY AND TUESDAY. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL EXTEND ACROSS NORTH FLORIDA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES SHOULD BE NEAR ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF 
AN INCH SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. LOW CHANCE POPS SHOULD 
SUFFICE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. NO CHANGES TO THE LONG TERM 
PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. 

&&

.MARINE...
EAST SURFACE WINDS SHOULD INCREASE LATE TODAY INTO TONIGHT. AN 
EXPANSION OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHWEST ATLANTIC TO FLORIDA 
COULD RESULT IN SUSTAINED EAST SURFACE WINDS AS HIGH AS 17 KNOTS 
SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL SHIFT SOUTHWARD TO NORTH FLORIDA MONDAY AND TUESDAY. NO 
ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST 
TUESDAY. MARINERS ON THE NEARSHORE WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS 
SHOULD BE ALERT FOR POSSIBLE FUNNEL CLOUDS AND WATERSPOUTS THIS 
AFTERNOON.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS MORNING 
ACROSS THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE. MAIN IMPACTS TO AVIATION 
THIS MORNING WILL BE ISOLATED MVFR SHOWERS...MAINLY ACROSS THE 
MARINE AND KEYS PORTION OF THE ROUTE. THIS AFTERNOON...LOOK FOR 
SCATTERED MVFR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ALONG 
SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA. SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY 
WILL MIGRATE INTO THE GULF AND BAY WATERS ADJOINING THE FLORIDA 
KEYS...DUE TO A LIGHT EAST NORTHEAST FLOW. IN ADDITION...THE LOWER 
TROPOSPHERIC WIND PROFILE WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR CLOUD LINE 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG A PORTION OF THE KEYS. THIS WILL LIKELY RESULT IN 
ISOLATED MVFR SHOWERS AND IFR THUNDERSTORMS NEAR AND DOWNSTREAM OF 
THE LARGER ISLANDS. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM CONVECTIVE AND DIURNAL

AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS EVENING REVEALS A DEEP LAYER 
MEAN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO WITH 
RIDGING AT NEARLY ALL LEVELS OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS. AT THE 
SURFACE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE EXTENDS WEST TO NEAR THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA....AND A SMALL HIGH PRESSURE CELL WAS CENTERED OVER THE 
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...WITH A COL REGION OVER THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA. SURFACE WINDS AVERAGED GENERALLY BELOW 12KT AT MOST 
SERVICE AREA PLATFORMS...BUT WERE QUITE VARIABLE IN DIRECTION... 
RANGING FROM EAST OFF THE MID AND UPPER KEYS...TO NORTHEAST BETWEEN 
KEY WEST AND THE DRY TORTUGAS...TO NORTHWEST AT GULF BUOY 42014. THE 
KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED A MOIST SURFACE LAYER AND A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE STRATIFICATION WITH WEAK WIND FLOW THROUGHOUT 
THE TROPOSPHERE. CONSIDERABLE DRY AIR WAS PRESENT BETWEEN 
3000-14000FT AGL...AND A STABLE LAYER WAS DETECTED JUST BELOW THE 
LEVEL OF FREE CONVECTION. A LEGACY LOWER KEYS CUMULUS LINE WAS 
ENERGIZED BY MAINLAND OUTFLOW...AND INDUCED A FEW SHORT-LIVED 
MODERATE TO HEAVY SHOWERS BETWEEN BOCA CHICA AND KEY WEST 9-10PM.

OVERNIGHT FORECASTS ARE ON TRACK. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE SLIGHT AND 
SHOWER COVERAGE ISOLATED OWING TO LACK OF SURFACE FORCING AND DRY 
AIR PRESENT IN THE LOW LEVELS.
&&

.MARINE...
WINDS WILL BECOME MORE UNIFORM OVER THE SERVICE AREA OVERNIGHT AS 
AFTERNOON SEA/ISLAND-BREEZE CIRCULATIONS DAMPEN OUT. EXPECT MAINLY 
EAST BREEZES 5-10KT OVER ISLANDS AND WATERS NORTH...WITH 10KT EAST 
BREEZES ACROSS THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA. SHOWERS WILL BE ISOLATED IN 
COVERAGE...WITH ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A LONE THUNDERSTORM.

.CURRENTLY...
THE ATLANTIC SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AXIS EXTENDS WESTWARD OVER 
THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS TO THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA. SEA BREEZE 
CIRCULATIONS ON BOTH COASTS OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA HAVE 
OVERWHELMED THE WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT FLOW AROUND THE RIDGE AXIS...
AFFECTING FLORIDA BAY WINDS. BUT ON THE ISLANDS AND OVER ATLANTIC 
WATERS WINDS HAVE GONE CLOSE TO EAST AS EXPECTED...MAINLY IN THE 
5-10 KT RANGE. A CUMULUS LINE HAS REPEATED FORMED OVER THE KEYS...
AND EVEN LEAD TO A FEW MIDDAY SHOWERS IN THE KEY WEST AREA. ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE POPPED UP ON THE WEST SIDE OF ANDROS ISLAND. 
SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGES SHOW RELATIVELY DRIER AIR OVER SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND THE UPPER KEYS...BUT SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT MOST OF 
THIS DRYING IS AROUND 10 THSD FT AGL AND HIGHER. 


.FORECASTS...
.TONIGHT...A 500 MB ANTICYCLONE SHOULD BE CENTERED OVERHEAD OF THE 
KEYS TONIGHT WITH WEAK SUBSIDING AIR OVER THE REGION. 20 PCT CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE RETAINED IN THE FORECAST FOR 
TONIGHT SINCE ISOLATED CONVECTION CANT BE RULED OUT ON BOUNDARIES...
BUT AFTER HEATING OF ISLANDS WANES AND LOCAL CUMULUS FADE...WE
MAY HAVE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FOR A WHILE TONIGHT. THE RIDGE JUST TO 
OUR NORTH OUGHT NOT TO CHANGE MUCH OVERNIGHT...GIVING EAST WINDS 
5-10 KT AT ISLAND SITES. 

FRI-FRI NIGHT...THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL MAINTAIN A LOW LEVEL FLOW 
FROM THE EAST NEAR 10 MPH...WITH MOIST CONDITIONS FROM THE SURFACE 
UP TO 10 THSD FT. MODELS STILL INDICATE THAT THE UPPER LEVEL 
ANTICYCLONE NOW OVER THE KEYS...WILL SHIFT WEST OVER THE GULF. A 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH AT LEVELS FROM 500 MB UP TO 250 MB IS FORECAST TO 
SWING SSE OVER EASTERN FLORIDA AND THE ATLANTIC TO THE KEYS FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH PRODUCING SOME UPWARD VERTICAL VELOCITY 
FIELDS AROUND THE KEYS...ALONG WITH A BIT HIGHER MOISTURE CONTENT IN 
THOSE LOWER LEVELS. STEERING FLOW MAY BE FROM THE NE OR ENE...WHICH 
MAY ENABLE SOME AFTERNOON SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS TO FLING A FEW 
BOUNDARIES TOWARD THE KEYS. AT ANY RATE...30 PCT CHANCE OF PRECIP 
WILL BE MAINTAINED IN FORECASTS BASED ON THESE CONSIDERATIONS. MOS 
GUIDANCE IS 20-30 PCT FOR POPS IN THESE PERIODS. 

SAT-THU...A LARGER AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE IS STILL FORECAST BY ALL 
MODELS TO EXPAND OFF THE SE U.S. COAST...AND THEREBY BOOST EASTERLY 
FLOW OVER THE KEYS. THIS PORTENDS A RATHER PROLONGED PERIOD OF 
MODERATE EASTERLY BREEZES...10-15 MPH. MOISTURE IS FORECAST TO 
REMAIN TYPICALLY PLENTIFUL FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 10 THSD FT...AND
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT SHOWERS WILL BE SET OFF DURING THIS PERIOD BY 
CLOUD LINES EMANATING OFF THE BAHAMAS...ALONG WITH SOME TENDENCY FOR 
NOCTURNAL ENHANCEMENT OF SHOWERS. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT A 500 MB 
LOW IS FORECAST BY THE GFS TO FORM WITHIN THE LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER 
THE BAHAMAS SUNDAY...THEN RETROGRADE WESTWARD OVER THE KEYS DURING 
THE MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. IT IS POSSIBLE THAT 
SOME LARGE SCALE LIFT AND/OR ENHANCED MOISTURE MAY PROMPT HIGHER 
CHANCES OF RAIN FOR THESE PERIODS. 
&&

.MARINE...
THE WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE JUST TO OUR NORTH WILL MAINTAIN A 
MAINLY EAST WIND FLOW 5-10 KT ON BAY AND GULF WATERS...CLOSER TO 10 
KT FOR ATLANTIC SIDE WATERS. A SLIGHT INCREASE IN WINDS SHOULD SET 
IN FRIDAY NIGHT...FOLLOWED BY WINDS JUMPING UP TO 10-15 KT OR MAYBE 
NEAR 15 KT FOR SATURDAY AND CONTINUING ON WELL INTO NEXT WEEK. THIS 
IS DUE TO AN EXPECTED EXPANSION OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NW 
ATLANTIC TO FLORIDA.

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS 
WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 12Z. ISOLATED SHOWERS

230 AM EDT THU JUN 15 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(FROM 700 TO 200 
MB)...LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY AND OBSERVATIONS DEPICT A LOW 
AMPLITUDE UPPER LOW SITUATED OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES. TO THE 
SOUTH...A RATHER STRONG AND EXPANSIVE 590 DM PLUS 500 MB ANTICYCLONE 
IS CENTERED OVER THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS. SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS 
LIE ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE LARGE ANTICYCLONE...BENEATH RATHER 
DRY AIR ABOVE 700 MB

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVEL..(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...1004 MB REMNANT LOW 
OF ALBERTO IS SITUATED SOUTH OF LONG ISLAND...TRAILING A WEAK TROUGH 
SOUTHWARD TO OFF THE CAROLINAS. TO THE SOUTH OF THAT FEATURE...A 
WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM 30N 50W 
SOUTHWESTWARD TO OVER EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA.

.CURRENTLY...SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLEAR OVER THE ISLAND ARCHIPELAGO AND 
ADJOINING WATERS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 80 DEGREES...WITH DEWPOINT 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MIDDLE 70S. KEY WEST RADAR IS NOT INDICATING ANY 
ECHOES AT THE TIME ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA...BUT SOME FAINT ECHOES 
ARE VISIBLE IN THE FAR EASTERN STRAITS NEAR THE CAY SAL BANK. WINDS 
ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND IN SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE BETWEEN EAST 
AND AND SOUTHEAST AT 4 TO 7 KNOTS.  

.FORECASTS...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...THE AFOREMENTIONED 
590-593 DM 500 MB CENTER OF LARGE SCALE UPPER RIDGING WILL REMAIN 
OVER THE KEYS TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN MIGRATE TO OVER THE 
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. ONLY SLIGHT WEAKENING OF 
THE UPPER RIDGING OVER THE KEYS IS EXPECTED MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN VERY DRY ATMOSPHERE ABOVE 700 MB.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...FOR TODAY...THE ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER EXTREME SOUTH FLORIDA WILL REMAIN SITUATED  IN ITS 
CURRENT POSITION FROM THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC TO OVER THE BAHAMAS TO 
SOUTH FLORIDA. ANOTHER WEAK HIGH PRESSURE LOCALLY WILL BUILD OVER 
THE EASTERN GULF. THIS SPLIT RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL ALSO BE 
COMBINED WITH A DECENT THERMAL TROUGH OVER THE PENINSULA...AND WILL 
RESULT IN A LIGHT BUT BACKED WIND FLOW IN THE BOUNDARY  
LAYER...CONDUCIVE TO CUMULUS/TCU CLOUD LINES OVER THE LOWER AND 
MIDDLE KEYS. PWAT...(PRECIPITABLE WATER) VALUES SHOULD BE AROUND 
1.75 INCHES OF WATER. THIS SUPPORTS LOW CHANCE POPS...WHICH IS WHAT 
WE HAVE GOING.

TONIGHT...WEAK EAST TO NORTHEAST FLOW IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER...THE 
RESULT OF WEAK RIDGING TO OUR NORTH...WILL REMAIN IN PLACE...BUT 
SINCE 12 HOUR POPS WILL REMAIN LOW...AND ONLY BOUNDARIES IN A WEAK 
STEERING FLOW WOULD INITIATE CONVECTION...WILL HOLD WITH JUST SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS.

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...MODELS INDICATE THE WEAK RIDGING WILL 
CONTINUE TO THE NORTH OF THE KEYS....ALLOWING FOR A LIGHT EAST TO 
NORTHEAST FLOW OVER THE ISLANDS. THE THERMAL TROUGH OVER THE 
MAINLAND COULD ALLOW FOR WINDS TO GO MORE NORTHEASTERLY FOR A 
TIME...BUT 00Z FORECAST SOUNDING INDICATE THAT THIS DOES NOT LOOK AS 
PRONOUNCED TOMORROW AS IT DOES FOR TODAY. NEVERTHELESS...WILL HOLD 
WITH WHAT WE HAVE ALREADY FORECASTED FOR THIS PERIOD...WHICH IS 30 
PERCENT.

SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...00Z NAM...ECMWF AND GFS IS INDICATING 
THAT HIGHER PRESSURE...NEAR 1025 MB RIDGING...WILL DEVELOP OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC BETWEEN BERMUDA AND THE CAROLINAS. AS A 
RESULT...INCREASING MOISTURE AND MODERATE WINDS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
ISLANDS...DELIVERING A TRADE WIND REGIME ACROSS THE ISLANDS...WITH 
LATE NIGHT AND MORNING SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS.

SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN 
PLACE THROUGH THIS TIME...AND LATEST MODEL RUNS ATTM DO NOT SHOW ANY 
POSSIBLE DEFINED WAVES OR SIGNIFICANT IMPULSES DETECTABLE ENOUGH 
THAT WOULD SUPPORT MORE THAN LOW CHANCE POPS ATTM.

&&

.MARINE...TODAY AND FRIDAY...A LIGHT WIND FLOW REGIME WILL EXIST 
TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY. MARINERS WILL SEE CUMULUS LINE DEVELOP LATE 
THIS MORNING AND THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON TODAY AND FRIDAY. CUMULUS 
CLOUD LINES NEAR THE KEYS TODAY ARE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING 
WATERSPOUTS. WATERSPOUTS ARE MOST LIKELY TO FORM UNDER A LARGE CLOUD 
BUILDUP WITH A DARK...FLAT BASE. FOR THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...MODERATE BREEZES WILL RETURN ON THE WATERS SATURDAY THROUGH 
THE REST OF THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE POSSIBLE EACH DAY AND NIGHT. THE PRIMARY THUNDERSTORM HAZARD 
WILL BE DANGEROUS CLOUD TO SURFACE LIGHTNING STRIKES.

HIGH PRESSURE IS SAGGING ACROSS THE LOCAL AREA LATE THIS EVENING. 
WINDS ARE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AT ALL REPORTING LOCATIONS AND THE LATE 
EVENING LOCAL SOUNDING SHOWS THIS RELAXED PROFILE THROUGH A DEEP 
LAYER. KBYX RADAR IS QUIET IN THE SERVICE AREA. SATELLITE SHOWS JUST 
A FEW WEAK REMNANT CLOUDS AND BOUNDARIES MOVING ACROSS THE EASTERN 
EXTENT OF THE SERVICE AREA FROM EARLIER AFTERNOON CONVECTION NEAR 
CUBA AND ANDROS ISLAND. THERE IS ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE TO 
HOLD ON TO AN ISOLATED SHOWER LATE TONIGHT THOUGH...SO NO ZONE

===============================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS FROM THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS 
TO NEAR THE MID AND LOWER KEYS...PROVIDING A LIGHT S TO SW WIND FLOW 
OVER THE KEYS AND ADJACENT WATERS. C-MAN WINDS ARE GENERALLY 5 TO 10 
KT THIS HOUR. ONLY FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS AND A FEW THIN CIRRUS 
STREAKS ARE SEEN OVER THE KEYS AT THIS TIME...EXCEPT FOR THE NORTH 
HALF OF KEY LARGO WHERE EARLIER A CU/TCU FIELD DEVELOPED DUE TO 
PERFECTLY PARALLEL SW FLOW. THESE CLOUDS HAVE THINNED OUT. DESPITE A 
LITTLE DRYING IN THE 8-15 THSD FT AGL LEVELS AS SHOWN BY THE MORNING 
KEY WEST SOUNDING AND THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS FOR LATER TODAY...THERE
IS ENOUGH LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE FOR A NEW BATCH OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO HAVE JUST FORMED ON THE NW CUBAN COAST DUE SOUTH OF 
THE LOWER KEYS...AND ALSO ON ANDROS ISLAND IN THE BAHAMAS. THE 
CURRENT STEERING FLOW OVER CUBA IS TOWARD THE NORTH...BUT 
INDICATIONS ARE THAT IT WILL TURN TO A LIGHT EASTERLY BY LATE 
AFTERNOON. 


.FORECAST...
.TONIGHT...MODELS AGREE THAT THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL GO 
EVEN WEAKER. NAM AND GFS MODELS SUGGESTS A VARIABLE WIND PATTERN 5 
KT OR 5-10 KT BUT TENDING TO GO ENE BETWEEN MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE.
A WEAK LAND BREEZE MIGHT EVEN SET IN LATE NEAR THE SOUTH FLORIDA 
MAINLAND...ON FLORIDA BAY, NEAR COASTAL GULF WATERS, NEAR THE UPPER 
KEYS. THAT...ALONG WITH ERRANT BOUNDARIES AND ONGOING AFTERNOON 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO OUR SE AND S...PROMPTS ME TO KEEP SOME 
MENTION OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...WITH ALL 
MODELS SHOWING LOW POPS...AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING A BIT OF 
DRY AIR ALOFT UNTIL ABOUT 12Z THU...THEN I WILL RELEGATE POPS TO 
ONLY 10 PCT AND USE MOSTLY CLEAR FOR SKY DESCRIPTOR. 

THU...A LIGHT NE TO E WIND FLOW IS INDICATED AS THE SURFACE RIDGE 
SLIPS TO OUR NORTH AND A SUBTLE S-TO-N ORIENTED TROUGH SETS UP NEAR 
THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND (COULD BE A THERMAL TROUGH OR SPLIT IN 
THE RIDGE). THIS WIND FLOW OF COURSE WOULD BE FAVORABLE FOR 
AFTERNOON TCUS OVER THE ISLANDS...SO A 30 PCT CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL 
BE MAINTAINED...AND IT SHOULD PRIMARILY BE FOR AFTERNOON HOURS. 
A MID LEVEL (500 MB) HIGH CENTER SHOULD MOVE OVER THE KEYS...WHICH
MAY TEND TO HOLD DOWN SHOWER COVERAGE...BUT NOT SUPPRESS IT.

THU NIGHT-FRI-FRI NIGHT...A TURN OF WINDS CLOSER TO E OVER A DEEPER 
LOWER LEVEL IS STILL EXPECTED AS THE WEAK HIGH PRESSURE NOW OVER THE 
KEYS SHIFTS A BIT FARTHER NORTH. ALSO...A WEAK MID TO HIGH LEVEL 
TROUGH...500 MB-250 MB...IS INDICATED TO SWING SSE OVER THE KEYS AND 
THE GFS MODEL SHOWS A SLIGHT TEMPORARY INCREASE IN MOISTURE COMING 
IN FROM THE NE FRI AND FRI NIGHT. A 20 PCT CHANCE OF PRECIP THU 
NIGHT WILL BE CARRIED...HOPING THAT ANY AFTERNOON SHOWERS THU WILL 
WANE IN THE EVENING...BUT 30 PCT POPS ARE NEEDED FRI AND FRI NIGHT.

SAT-WED...THE LARGER MORE SUBSTANTIAL SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AREA IS 
EXPECTED TO EXPAND OFF THE CAROLINA COASTS...AND THIS WILL DRIVE A 
MODERATE DEEP EASTERLY FLOW OVER THE KEYS. OVERALL NICE CONDITIONS 
ARE EXPECTED WITH EAST WINDS 10-15 MPH (MAYBE CLOSE TO 15 MPH AT 
TIMES)...FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS...AND STILL A CHANCE OF PASSING 
SHOWERS ON THE TRADEWINDS. 
&&

.MARINE...
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO BE OVER THE KEYS TONIGHT...
GIVING A VARIABLE WIND PATTERN 5-10 KT AND SLIGHT SEAS. THAT HIGH 
PRESSURE AREA WILL SHIFT NORTH A BIT THURSDAY...ALLOWING KEYS WINDS 
TO TURN NE TO E 5-10 KT...STILL WITH SLIGHT SEAS. WATCH FOR A FEW 
SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THURSDAY...EXCEPT SHOWERS MAY 
CONCENTRATE OVER OR NEAR THE ISLANDS THU AFTERNOON. 

A LARGER AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL GRADUALLY EXPAND OVER THE NW 
ATLANTIC TO FLORIDA STARTING FRIDAY NIGHT...AND CONTINUING THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND INTO NEXT WEEK...WHICH WILL BRING EAST WINDS 10-15 KT 
OVER KEYS WATERS. WINDS MAY RISE CLOSER TO 15 KT AT TIMES SUNDAY AND

1000 AM EDT WED JUN 14 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE HAS SHIFTED NORTH AND NOW LIES 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL BAHAMAS TO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS...PROVIDING 
A SSW FLOW OVER THE UPPER KEYS...S OVER THE MID AND LOWER KEYS AND 
ADJACENT WATERS...WITH SPEEDS NOT FAR FROM 10 KT. THE KEY WEST 
MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED PRECIPITABLE WATER DOWN A BIT...TO 1.75 
INCH. SLIGHT DRYING WAS NOTED BETWEEN 5 AND 15 THSD FT AGL...AND 
MOST MID AND HIGH CLOUD COVER THAT HAD PLAGUED THE AREA RECENTLY HAS 
GONE DUE TO ALBERTOS CONVECTIVE TRAIL HAVING DIMINISHED AND PUSHED 
NW. KEYS AREA ISLANDS AND WATERS ARE CURRENTLY MOSTLY SUNNY AND 
PRECIPITATION FREE. ANOTHER CONVECTIVE BAND NORTH OF THE RIDGE IN 
SOME CONVERGENT FLOW IS PRODUCING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BETWEEN 
ANDROS ISLAND AND THE SE FLORIDA MAINLAND. 

.FORECAST...
MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE A SLIGHT ADDITIONAL DECREASE IN 
MOISTURE ALOFT OVER THE KEYS DURING THE DAY...BUT ENOUGH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN SO AS TO SUPPORT JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS. WITH THE SURFACE RIDGE WEAKENING OVER THE 
KEYS...WINDS SHOULD GO LIGHTER THROUGH THE DAY. 
&&

.MARINE...
A S TO SW FLOW NEAR 10 KT LATE THIS MORNING...SHOULD GO MORE EAST OR 
VARIABLE LATER TODAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE PINCHES OFF OVER THE 
KEYS...AND THIS TOO SHOULD SLACKEN WIND SPEEDS INTO THE 5-10 KT 
RANGE. A LIGHT WIND FLOW STILL APPEARS IN STORE FOR TONIGHT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. BY MID AFTERNOON SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP...MAINLY ALONG THE MAINLAND PORTION OF 
THE ROUTE...PRODUCING MVFR AND ISOLATED IFR CONDITIONS. THIS IS 
REFLECTED IN THE CURRENT TWB115 PRODUCT. VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED 
AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS...WITH SURFACE WINDS GENERALLY FROM 
THE SOUTH AT LESS THAN 10 KNOTS...BECOMING LIGHT AND VARIABLE THIS 
EVENING.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
315 AM EDT WED JUN 14 2006

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS(FROM 700 TO 200 
MB)...LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY AND OBSERVATIONS DEPICT A RATHER 
PROGRESSIVE LATE SPRING PATTERN CONTINUING THIS MORNING ACROSS THE 
CONUS...WITH A NARROW POSITIVELY TILTED FULL LATITUDE TROUGH 
EXTENDING FROM LAKE HURON SOUTH SOUTHWEST TO THE NORTHWEST GULF OF 
MEXICO. TO THE EAST OF THE THAT FEATURE...A LARGE AND SPRAWLING 
ANTICYCLONE IS PRESENTLY CENTERED OVER CENTRAL CUBA. SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS LIE UNDERNEATH THIS DEEPENING ANTICYCLONE...WITH JUST 
SOME THIN CIRROSTRATUS MOVING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST OVER THE 
KEYS...AHEAD OF THE TROUGH OVER THE GULF OF MEX.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVEL..(SURFACE TO 700 MB)...A WESTERN ATLANTIC 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM 30N 60W SOUTHWEST TO ACROSS THE 
BAHAMAS TO CUBA. A TROPICAL WAVE IS MOVING ALONG THE SOUTHERN EDGE 
OF THE ATLANTIC DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE...AND IS NEAR THE NORTHEAST 
LEEWARD ISLANDS. 1002 MB TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO CONTINUES TO MOVE 
NORTHEAST BETWEEN 15 AND 20 MPH ACROSS SOUTHERN GEORGIA. THE SYSTEM 
IS TRAILING A TROUGH SOUTHWEST INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH...WEAKENING LOW LEVEL CONFLUENCE IS ALLOWING 
FOR GRADUAL DISSIPATION OF RAINBANDS NORTHWARD INTO THE SYSTEM. 
SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS REMAIN BENEATH DEEP AND MOIST SOUTH TO 
SOUTH SOUTHWEST FLOW.

.CURRENTLY...SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATE SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY OVER 
THE ISLANDS...WITH THE TOTAL CELESTIAL DOME CONSISTING OF SOME LOW 
CUMULUS AND CIRROSTRATUS. KEY WEST RADAR IS PRESENTLY DEVOID OF 
RADAR ECHOES...WITH FEW LEFTOVER BOUNDARIES VISIBLE FROM CONVECTION 
EARLIER LAST EVENING. C-MAN STATIONS ALONG THE FLORIDA REEF AND 
SOUTHERN FLORIDA BAY ARE REGISTERING SOUTH SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH 
SOUTHWEST WINDS BETWEEN 8 AND 12 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE RIGHT NEAR 
80 DEGREES. 

 
.FORECASTS...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...00Z RUNS OF 
ECMWF...NAM...AND GFS ALL INDICATE THE TROUGHING OVER THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES WILL FLATTEN RATHER ABRUPTLY TODAY...WITH NEAR 590 DM 
RIDGING BUILDING OVER HALF OF THE UNITED STATES FROM THE MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER EASTWARD AND SOUTHWARD BY TOMORROW...AND THIS WILL BRIDGE THE 
TROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE PRESENTLY CENTERED OVER CUBA BY THE END OF 
THE WEEKEND AND INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR 
GOOD DRYING FROM 700 MB ON UP.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...THE TROPICAL SYSTEM NOW OVER GEORGIA 
WILL MOVE NORTHEAST QUICKLY WHILE TRANSLATING INTO AN EXTRA-TROPICAL 
SYSTEM. UPON THE SYSTEMS DEPARTURE...MODELS INDICATE THAT THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE NOW NEAR THE FLORIDA STRAITS WILL MOVE 
SLIGHTLY NORTHWARD TO BE RIGHT OVER THE KEYS BY LATE IN THE DAY 
TODAY AND OVERNIGHT. AS A RESULT...DECENT 900 TO 700 MB DRYING WILL 
CONTINUE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE 00Z NAM AND GFS 12 HOUR POP #S 
THROUGH 00Z THURSDAY...TODAY...FALL TO BETWEEN 15 AND 20 PERCENT. 
THE BEST CHANCE FOR A CUMULUS LINE TODAY LOOKS TO BE IN THE LATE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WHEN LIGHT SURFACE TO 10 KFT WINDS WILL BACK 
TO NORTHEAST.

THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...MODELS ARE INDICATING THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL MOVE JUST SLIGHTLY NORTH OF THE KEYS THURSDAY. 
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING OVER THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF  
MEXICO...COMBINED WITH THE DAILY RETURN OF THE SOUTH FLORIDA THERMAL 
TROUGH SHOULD ALLOW BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS TO BACK TO NORTHEAST. 00Z 
GFS AND NAM MODELS ARE NOW ADVERTISING 12 TO 24 POPS DURING THE DAY 
AND NEAR 10 PERCENT THURSDAY NIGHT. ALTHOUGH THIS IS THE CASE...WITH 
LIGHT NORTHEAST FLOW IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER...WOULD LIKELY SEE WELL 
DEVELOPED CUMULUS TCU LINES BOTH IN MORNING AND LATER 
AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS. IN ADDITION...PWATS(PRECIPITABLE WATER) 
REMAIN BETWEEN 1.75 AND 2 INCHES. SO WILL HOLD WITH INHERITED LOW 
CHANCE POPS HERE ATTM.

FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...APPEARS THAT THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE 
BECOMES BETTER ESTABLISHED OVER THE ATLANTIC AND ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA...ALLOWING FOR A RETURN TO DEEPER EASTERLY FLOW BOTH 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. MODELS 12 HOUR POP #S ARE ABOUT RIGHT...DUE 
TO THE DIURNAL CONVECTION OVER THE STRAITS AND ISLANDS PROMOTING 
LATE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING RAIN CHANCES.

SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL REMAIN NORTH 
OF THE KEYS...AND THE KEYS REMAIN IN THE DEEP EASTERLY FLOW. GFS 
STILL HINTS THAT A TROPICAL WAVE PRESENTLY NEAR THE LEEWARD ISLANDS 
WILL PASS TO THE SOUTH OF THE KEYS ON SUNDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT. 12 
HOUR POP #S CONTINUE TO BE BETWEEN 20 AND 30 PERCENT AND IT IS STILL 
WAY TOO EARLY TO JUMP ON THIS IN TERMS OF ENHANCED RAINFALL. WILL 
HOLD WITH INHERITED CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

&&

.MARINE...BOATING CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TO IMPROVE THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY...AS WINDS AND SEAS WILL DROP DOWN DUE TO A RIDGE MOVING BACK 
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FLORIDA STRAITS. LIGHT TO GENTLE WINDS ON 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD BOATING CONDITIONS THOSE 
DAYS. MODERATE WINDS RETURN ON THE WEEKEND. EXPECT ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...
SEVERAL CLUSTERS OF STRONG STORMS MOVED QUICKLY NORTHWARD ACROSS THE 
STRAITS THIS AFTERNOON...AND A COUPLE MOVED ACROSS THE LOWER AND 
MIDDLE KEYS BEFORE WEAKENING ON THE GULF SIDE OF THE ISLANDS. KBYX 
RADAR SHOWS LINGERING STORMS LIFTING OUT OF THE SERVICE AREA TOWARD 
THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF THE MAINLAND...AND LINGERING WEAKER ECHOES IN 
THE EXTREME EASTERN PORTION OF OUR ATLANTIC WATERS. ALBERTO 
CONTINUES TO PULL THROUGH SOUTHEAST GEORGIA THIS EVENING...WITH A 
LONG TRAIL OF DEEP MOISTURE ALIGNED NORTHWEST OF OUR SERVICE AREA. 
EVENING IR SATELLITE IMAGES SHOWS PERIODIC BREAKS IN THE THICKER 
CLOUD COVER ALONG THE ISLANDS. THESE BREAKS SHOULD CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT...SO A LATE EVENING ZONE UPDATE WAS MORE OPTIMISTIC ON THE 
SKY CONDITION. THERE MAY BE SOME SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH THE STRAITS 
LATER TONIGHT...BUT FELT THAT A SLIGHT CHANCE WOULD COVER IT FOR THE 
FIRST PERIOD. TEMPERATURES SHOULD NOT MOVE VERY FAR FROM THEIR 
PRESENT READINGS.

.MARINE...
OBSERVATIONS SHOW SEAS IN THE WESTERN PORTION OF THE SERVICE AREA 
HAVE DROPPED ENOUGH TO REMOVE THE EXERCISE CAUTION HEADLINE IN THOSE 
WATERS. THE LATE EVENING MARINE UPDATE WILL HAVE A CONSOLIDATED 
ATLANTIC MARINE ZONE...WITH NO HEADLINES IN ANY WATERS.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THIS EVENING ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO

================================================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE LONG MOISTURE STREAM RUNNING FROM THE YUCATAN AND W CUBA NNE 
INTO ALBERTOS EAST SIDE HAS REMAINED INTACT SO FAR THROUGH THE 
DAY...AND CONTINUES TO SPREAD CONSIDERABLE CONVECTION OVER GULF 
WATERS...THE EASTERN EDGE OF WHICH IS AFFECTING THE WESTERN FLORIDA 
STRAITS...THE DRY TORTUGAS...AND OUR FORECAST WATERS IN THE GULF 
OFFSHORE FROM MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY. WIDESPREAD RAIN WITH HEAVY 
EMBEDDED SHOWERS AND SOME THUNDERSTORMS ARE ONGOING IN THE MOISTURE 
BAND. MEANWHILE...SHEETS OF MID AND HIGH CLOUDS BLOWING NE ARE 
AFFECTING THE KEYS ON-AND-OFF. MOST IMPORTANTLY...A BAND OF SHOWERS 
AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS HAS MOVED NORTH OFF CUBA...ENHANCED BY 
AFTERNOON HEATING OVER THE EAST AND CENTRAL PARTS OF THAT ISLAND...
AND THESE ARE AIMED NORTHWARD INTO THE STRAITS SOUTH OF THE LOWER 
AND MID KEYS. 
 
.FORECAST...
TONIGHT...A MOIST LOW LEVEL FROM THE SOUTH MAY BRING ONGOING 
CUBAN-ORIGINATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NORTHWARD TO THE KEYS 
THROUGH THE EVENING...SO ONGOING FORECASTS OF ENHANCED CHANCE OF 
RAIN EARLY TONIGHT SEEMS ON TARGET. MEANWHILE...EFFECTS OF ALBERTO 
ON OUR LOCAL WIND HAVE ALREADY DECREASED...SO SOUTH WINDS IN THE 
10-15 KT RANGE OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS IS ALREADY BEING ACHIEVED. THE 
LARGE SWATH OF RAIN AND CONVECTION TO OUR WEST...MAY CREEP A BIT 
EASTWARD BUT ON THE WHOLE OUGHT NOT TO MAKE TOO MUCH PROGRESS TOWARD 
THE KEYS INHABITED ISLANDS. 

WED...A SURFACE RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO LIFT NORTH TOWARD THE KEYS...
AND CAUSE LOCAL S TO SW WINDS TO DECREASE FURTHER...TO NEAR 10 KT IN 
THE AFTERNOON AND MAYBE LESS THAN 10 KT LATE IN THE DAY. HOPEFULLY 
THE MOISTURE TAIL FROM ALBERTO WILL BEGIN TO WITHER...BUT 30 PCT 
POPS WILL BE RETAINED BASED ON LOCAL MOISTURE AT LOWER LEVELS. LIGHT 
WINDS MAY ALLOW SOME BUILDUPS NEAR ISLANDS IN THE AFTERNOON..IF THE 
MOISTURE SWATH WERE TO SWING FARTHER EAST.

WED NIGHT-THU NIGHT...A WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE IS FORECAST 
NOW BY BOTH NAM AND GFS MODELS TO SETTLE OVER THE KEYS...GIVING A 
LIGHT WIND FLOW. THERE IS SOME EVIDENCE OF DRYING JUST ABOVE THE 
SURFACE TO ABOVE 850 MB...AND IF SO I MAY SHOULD INDICATE 20 PCT OR 
LESS POPS FOR PART OF THIS PERIOD...BUT WILL HOLD OFF FOR 
CONFIRMATION OF THE TREND. 

FRI-FRI NIGHT...HIGH PRESSURE IS EXPECTED TO BUILD SOUTH OVER THE NW 
ATLANTIC FROM A HIGH CENTER OFF THE CAROLINAS...AND THIS SHOULD TURN 
KEYS WINDS TO E AND INCREASE IN SPEED A BIT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
SURFACE UP TO 10 THSD FT SHOULD BE IN PLACE. 30 PCT POPS ARE 
CARRIED. 

SAT-TUE...A TROPICAL WAVE IS EXPECTED TO PASS SOUTH OF THE KEYS 
SOMETIME BUT HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUING TO BUILD TO OUR NORTH SHOULD 
KEEP ITS DIRECT EFFECTS SOUTH OF THE AREA. HOWEVER...LOCAL EAST 
WINDS MAY INCREASE A BIT MORE SAT AND SUN. WITH DEEP EAST FLOW AND 
MOISTURE SURFACE UP TO 10 THSD FT...SOME NIGHT AND MORNING 
ENHANCEMENT OF SHOWERS MAY OCCUR. 30 PCT POPS AGAIN. 
&&

.MARINE...
WIND EFFECTS OF ALBERTO HAVE BEGUN TO DECREASE...SO SOUTH WINDS 
10-15 KT ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT INTO EARLY WED...THEN WINDS SHOULD GO 
SSW NEAR 10 KT WED AFTERNOON. SEAS ARE RUNNING HIGH OVER GULF WATERS 
AND WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS...4-6 FT THIS EVENING...SO SMALL CRAFT 
WILL NEED TO EXERCISE CAUTION. ALSO...STRONG BANDS OF SHOWERS AND 
STORMS WILL AFFECT GULF WATERS INTO TONIGHT...WHILE EVENING SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS (SHORT LIVED) MOVE NORTH TO THE KEYS AND MAY 
PROVIDE BRIEF BUT STRONG GUSTS. 

LIGHTER WINDS ARE IN STORE WED NIGHT-THU NIGHT DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE 
SETTLING OVER THE AREA. A RETURN TO EAST WINDS...10 KT FRI 
INCREASING MAYBE TO NEAR 15 KT SAT AND SUN...IS EXPECTED AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS ALONG THE SE U.S. COAST. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS 
WELL AS AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS OVER THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON 
INTO THIS EVENING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DID DEVELOP THIS 
AFTERNOON ON SEA BREEZE BOUNDARIES IN SOUTH FLORIDA...BUT A 20 KNOT 
SOUTHERLY FLOW THROUGH THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE HAS FORCED MOST OF THIS 
ACTIVITY NORTHWARD OUT OF THE ROUTE. CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER CUBA AND ARE NOW MOVING NORTHWARD 
AT AROUND 20 KNOTS. SHOULD THESE CLUSTERS SURVIVE...THEY WILL BEGIN 
MOVING ACROSS THE TWEB ROUTE BY AROUND 600 PM. THE STRONGER SHOWERS 
WILL PRODUCE BLINDING DOWNPOURS...AND TURBULENT AND GUSTY WINDS. 
OTHERWISE...SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM CONVECTIVELY DISTURBED WEATHER 
WILL GENERALLY BE SOUTH TO SOUTHEASTERLY AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS.

WEAKENING TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO IS MIGRATING NORTHEASTWARD THROUGH 
THE EXTREME NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...WITH AN ASSOCIATED 
DISSIPATING TROUGH EXTENDING BACK INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
MEANWHILE...A WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE IS BEING HELD DOWN ACROSS THE 
ISLAND OF CUBA. THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS IS 
RESULTING IN SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS OF 15 TO 20 KNOTS ACROSS OUR

FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...DESPITE LOW LEVEL CONFLUENCE AND A MID AND 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH ALBERTO REMAINING OVER THE 
EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...A FAIRLY ROBUST...AND DEEP SOUTH TO 
SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL PROMPT SCATTERED 30 TO 40 PERCENT POPS MAINLY 
THIS AFTERNOON. OTHERWISE...IF CUBAN CONVECTION GETS GOING THIS 
AFTERNOON...A SOUTHERLY STEERING FLOW OF AROUND 17 KNOTS WOULD AT 
LEAST THREATEN OUR AREA WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
HOWEVER...DESPITE PLENTY OF INSOLATION YESTERDAY...CUBAN CONVECTION 
WAS SHUT DOWN. REGARDLESS...WILL INSERT ISOLATED POPS THIS 
MORNING...GIVING WAY TO SCATTERED POPS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
THEREAFTER...DEEP LAYERED RIDGING ACCOMPANIED BY DRIER AIR WILL 
RETURN POPS TO NEAR NORMAL ALONG WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO IS CURRENTLY MOVING NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE 
NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO...TOWARD THE NATURE COAST OF FLORIDA. 
THE FLORIDA KEYS LIE IN STRONG LOW-LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW BETWEEN 
TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO AND A SPRAWLING SUBTROPICAL ATLANTIC 
ANTICYCLONE. 

THE KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED A MOIST AND WEAKLY UNSTABLE 
ENVIRONMENT WITH SIGNIFICANT LOW-LEVEL CONVECTIVE INHIBITION DUE TO 
A LOW-ALTITUDE STABLE LAYER BETWEEN 700-1400FT AGL. CONSIDERABLE DRY 
AIR WAS PRESENT IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE ABOVE 1000FT AGL AS WELL. 
LOWER-TROPOSPHERIC WINDS WERE FAIRLY STRONG...AVERAGING 26KT IN THE 
1000-850MB LAYER. HOWEVER...WINDS DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE 
850MB. RADAR AND SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS EVENING HAVE SHOWN A 
PERSISTENT SWATH OF RAIN...HEAVY SHOWERS...AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
EXTENDING IN A CONFLUENT ZONE SOUTH-SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THE RIGHT 
FLANK OF TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO...ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...AND PORTIONS OF WESTERN CUBA AND THE YUCATAN CHANNEL. MOST 
OF THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS EAST OF THE MARQUESAS KEYS HAVE 
REMAINED RAIN-FREE ALL EVENING.

FORECASTS WILL BE UPDATED TO DECREASE PROBABILITIES OF RAIN 
OVERNIGHT...WITH THE PRIMARY JUSTIFICATIONS OF A STRONG LOW-LEVEL 
CAP AND THE PRESENCE OF DRY AIR IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS. IN 
ADDITION...AFTERNOON SEA-BREEZE CONVECTION WAS NOT AS ACTIVE AS 
EXPECTED OVER CUBA AND THEREFORE THERE ARE NOT AS MANY OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES MOVING NORTH. FINALLY...NUMERICAL MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THE LOW-LEVEL CONFLUENT ZONE JUST EAST OF THE KEYS WILL REMAIN 
NEARLY STATIONARY FOR THE NEXT 12 HOURS. PERSISTENCE ALSO SUPPORTS 
THIS SCENARIO.
&&

.MARINE...
MAINLY SOUTH BREEZES HAVE DECREASED DURING THE EVENING HOURS BY 
ABOUT 4-7KT...BUT WERE STILL BLOWING IN THE 15-20KT RANGE OVER 
WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST AND 20-60NM WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE. WINDS 
WERE GENERALLY NEAR 15KT ELSEWHERE. WE WILL LEAVE CURRENT ADVISORIES 
AND HEADLINES AS IS BECAUSE ANALYSES SUGGEST THAT THE CURRENTLY 
OBSERVED LULL IS TEMPORARY. ALSO...WE HAVE RECEIVED NO SHIP REPORTS 
OR SCATTEROMETER OBSERVATIONS DURING THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS TO 
PROVIDE GREATER CERTAINTY TO THE LARGER-SCALE OBSERVED WIND FIELD 
ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE...AS 
WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS THROUGH 12Z. THERE WILL BE A 
CHANCE OF STRONG SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING RAPIDLY NORTHWARD 
ACROSS THE ROUTE AND ISLAND LOCATIONS. THE STRONGER ACTIVITY WILL 
PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS OF 30 TO 40 KNOTS...PERIODS OF MVFR TO IFR 
VISIBILITY...AND CLOUD TO SURFACE LIGHTNING STRIKES. SURFACE WINDS 
AT THE KEYS ISLAND TERMINALS WILL AVERAGE 160/10-15KTS...RESULTING 
IN A 10-12KT CROSSWIND.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
THE CENTER OF TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO WAS ENTERING THE NE GULF OF 
MEXICO ON A MORE NORTHEASTERLY TRACK...DUE TO A QUICK REFORMATION OF 
THE CENTER EARLIER TODAY. IN FACT ON VISIBLE SATELLITE BOTH THE 
NEWLY DEVELOPED MAIN CENTER AND THE DISSIPATING FORMER CENTER ARE 
CLEARLY IDENTIFIABLE. THE STORM REMAINS RATHER LOP-SIDED DESPITE THE 
DEEPENING AND INTENSIFICATION TREND. AS A RESULT...THE EASTERN HALF 
OF THE STORM CONTINUES TO EXHIBIT FAR-FLUNG PRECIPITATION FIELDS...
AND THE OUTER SE PORTION OF THE CIRCULATION IS STILL TIED TO SEVERAL 
CONVECTIVE BANDS WHICH STRETCH NORTH AND NORTHEAST OUT OF THE 
NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN SEA. THESE BANDS CONTINUE TO MOVE NNE INTO GULF 
WATERS OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. LOCAL WINDS HAVE BEEN GREATLY AFFECTED 
BY THE PRESENCE OF PASSING CONVECTION...BUT OVERALL THE PRESSURE 
GRADIENT WIND FLOW SEEMS TO BE SOUTH NEAR 20 KT FOR WESTERN WATERS 
AND SOUTH NEAR 15 KT OR 15-20 KT FOR EASTERN WATERS. CONVECTIVE 
GUSTS HAVE EXCEEDED 30 KT AT DRY TORTUGAS. NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER 
FORECASTS EXPECT ALBERTO TO REACH HURRICANE STATUS BEFORE MOVING 
INLAND. MEANWHILE...VISIBLE AND WATER VAPOR SATELLITE DATE SHOW SOME 
DRYING ALOFT AND THE RETURN OF SUNSHINE AND FAIR-WEATHER CUMULUS 
OVER EASTERN CUBA AND SECTIONS OF THE NW CARIBBEAN OVER JAMAICA TO 
AREAS JUST WEST OF GRAND CAYMAN.

.FORECAST...
EFFECTS OF THE OUTERMOST CIRCULATION ON THE SE AND S SIDE OF ALBERTO 
WILL CONTROL KEYS AREA WEATHER TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...WITH DECREASING 
INFLUENCE TUESDAY NIGHT...FOLLOWED BY A RETURN TO MORE TYPICAL 
HIGH-PRESSURE DRIVEN WEATHER WEDNESDAY. LONG RANGE MODELS STILL 
INDICATE THAT A TROPICAL WAVE MAY PASS OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN 
FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...STAYING SOUTH OF THE KEYS BUT PERHAPS 
SLIGHTLY INCREASING THE EASTERLY FLOW OVER THE AREA. 

TONIGHT-TUESDAY...VARIOUS MODELS ALL INDICATE THAT THE KEYS WILL 
REMAIN IN THE GENERALLY SOUTH WIND FLOW WHICH IS PULLING MOISTURE 
NORTH INTO THE EAST SIDE OF ALBERTO...HOWEVER THE MODELS VARY SOME 
WITH REGARD TO LOCAL WIND SPEEDS. I HAVE KEPT WIND SPEEDS A LITTLE 
HIGHER FOR TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY BECAUSE OF THE NATIONAL HURRICANE 
CENTERS FORECAST OF CONTINUED DEEPENING OF ALBERTO UNTIL IT MOVES 
INLAND OVER NORTH OR NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA...AS A CAT 1 HURRICANE. 
THIS IS A CONSERVATIVE JUDGMENT AND MAY BE OVERDOING THE WIND 
SPEEDS. BEHAVIOR OF THE CONVECTIVE BANDS TO OUR WEST IS DIFFICULT TO 
FIGURE. THEY MAY TRANSLATE EAST AND AFFECT SOME OF THE KEYS...
THEY MAY BECOME DETACHED FROM ALBERTOS CIRCULATION AND FADE AWAY...
OR THEY MAY JUST PIVOT AND LIFT NE WITH THE CIRCULATION. THE GFS, 
NAM, AND UKMET MODELS ALL SUGGEST THE THIRD OPTION...WITH THE 
MOISTURE MAX STRETCHING NE FROM THE YUCATAN CHANNEL AND NOT MOVING 
OVER THE KEYS...WHILE THE DRIER AIR ABOVE 700 MB...AND A LITTLE 
DRYING BETWEEN 850 AND 700 MB...NOW OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN WORKS N 
AND NW ACROSS CUBA TO THE KEYS DURING TUE AND AFTERWARDS. 
HOWEVER...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS STILL EXPECTED TO BE PLENTIFUL.
THIS MAY ALLOW CONVECTION TO FIRE OVER CUBA WITH THE INCREASED 
SUNSHINE BOTH THIS AFTERNOON AND AGAIN TUE...AND WITH THE STIFF FLOW 
FROM THE SOUTH STORMS MAY STEER EASILY TO THE KEYS THIS EVENING AND 
AGAIN TUESDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING. I WILL KEEP POPS AT 50 PCT 
TONIGHT WHICH IS ABOVE GUIDANCE...AND 40 PCT TUE WHICH IS THE 
HIGHEST OF THE GUIDANCE NUMBERS GIVEN BY THE GFS. 

TUE NIGHT...SOME GRADUAL CONTINUED DECREASE IN SW TO S WIND FLOW IS 
EXPECTED AS ALBERTO MOVES FARTHER AWAY. LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE MAY 
BRING CUBAN DIURNAL THUNDERSTORMS NORTH AGAIN DESPITE DRYING ALOFT. 

WED-MON...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE SHOULD PUSH IN OVER THE KEYS WITH A 
PERIOD OF LIGHT WINDS LATE WED-WED NIGHT-INTO THU. FOR FRI AND SAT...
INCREASING E WINDS MAY SET IN IF THAT TROPICAL WAVE PASSES TO OUR 
SOUTH. 
&&

.MARINE...
PRESSURE GRADIENT EFFECTS OF ALBERTO WILL KEEP KEYS WINDS FROM THE 
SOUTH NEAR 20 KT ON KEYS GULF WATERS AND WESTERN SECTIONS OF KEYS 
ATLANTIC SIDE WATERS...15-20 KT WINDS OFF THE UPPER KEYS. WE ARE NOT 
OUT OF THE WOODS YET FOR FAST MOVING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO

AREA WINDS AND SEAS TO SETTLE DOWN TUE NIGHT...AND MORE SO WED...
AS HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE KEYS AND ALBERTO

CIRCULATION AROUND THE EASTERN HALF OF TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO 
CONTINUES TO AFFECT THE KEYS PRODUCING A MOIST SE TO S WIND FLOW 
OVER THE AREA. SUSTAINED WIND SPEEDS ARE AROUND 20 KT OVER LOWER 
KEYS AREAS...AND WATERS TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST. SPEEDS HAVE BEEN 
CLOSER TO 15 KT OR 15-20 KT FOR UPPER AND MID KEYS AREAS THE PAST 
FEW HOURS. THE EASTERNMOST CONVECTIVE BAND ASSOCIATED WITH ALBERTO 
IS MOVING NORTH OVER WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST...AND AFFECTING DRY 
TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. A SOLID FLOW OF RAIN WITH EMBEDDED HEAVY 
SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IS CURRENTLY AIMED AT FORT 
JEFFERSON. SPECIAL MARINE WARNINGS ARE IN EFFECT FOR THESE WATERS 
DUE TO WIND GUSTS OF 35 KT OR MORE IN CONVECTION. THERE HAVE BEEN A 
FEW MESOCYCLONES DETECTED BY RADAR IN THESE CELLS AS WELL. THE 
OVERALL BAND HAS BEGUN TO TRANSLATE SLIGHTLY EASTWARD. 

.FORECAST...
NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES IS ANTICIPATED. A POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS REMAINS IN PLACE EITHER FROM DEVELOPMENT ON NEW

GOES-12 IR IMAGERY SHOWS SIGNIFICANT UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE BETWEEN 
A MID LATITUDE TROUGH DIGGING INTO THE WEST CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO 
AND AN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE EXTREME NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN. 
BECAUSE OF THE STRONG UPPER DIFFLUENCE ALOFT...ANOTHER CONVECTIVE 
FLARE WITH TOPS AS COLD AS -81C EAST OF TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO. A 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA...WITH A 
TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT RESULTING IN SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WINDS OF 
AROUND 20 KNOTS WITH GUSTS NEAR 25 KNOTS ALONG THE REEF. 
MEANWHILE...LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING WIDELY SCATTERED SPRINKLES 
OVER OUR REGION...BUT WITH A BAND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
STREAMING NORTH NORTHWEST BEYOND 60 NM SOUTHWEST OF DRY TORTUGAS. 
 
.FORECAST...
AN EXTREMELY ASYMMETRICAL TROPICAL STORM ALBERT...LOCATED OVER THE 
SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO WILL CONTINUE TO MIGRATE SLOWLY NORTH 
NORTHEAST AROUND THE OUTER PERIPHERY OF THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND A 
DIGGING MID LATITUDE TROUGH REACHING INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. GIVEN THIS MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
PATTERN...THE ROBUST UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE AND LOW LEVEL CONFLUENCE 
WILL REMAIN WELL NORTH OF OUR REGION. HOWEVER...WITHIN THE VERY 
MOIST (PWAT 1.85 INCHES) AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD FORM TODAY AND TONIGHT. 
FURTHERMORE...ANY INSOLATION COMBINED WITH A STRONG AND VEERING 
SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH FLOW MAY GENERATE ORGANIZED MULTI-CELLULAR TYPE 
STORMS OF WHICH A FEW COULD BE STRONG WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL 
TODAY. FOR TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WITH TROPICAL SYSTEM ALBERTO 
LIFTING OUT AND WEAKENING...DEEP LAYERED RIDGING WILL ALLOW DRIER 
AIR TO FILTER IN...RESULTING IN CLIMO POPS AND AVERAGE TEMPERATURES. 

EXTENDED PERIOD...(THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)
A WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL EXTEND NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
KEYS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THEREAFTER...GFSLR INDICATES AN EASTERLY 
WAVE WILL MIGRATE WESTWARD THROUGH THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN WITH THE 
NORTHERN EXTENSION REACHING INTO OUR REGION THIS WEEKEND...PRECEDED 
AND ACCOMPANIED BY AN ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE WITHIN AN EXTREMELY DEEP 
EASTERLY FLOW. HOWEVER...ECMWF IS NOT NEARLY ROBUST OR AGGRESSIVE 
WITH THIS FEATURE...AND HENCE...WILL MAINTAIN CLIMO POPS AND 
TEMPERATURES AND WAIT FOR MODEL CONSISTENCY BEFORE MAKING ANY 
CHANGES TO THE ONGOING FORECAST.

BETWEEN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE NOSING ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF 
OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND WEAK TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO CRAWLING

TORTUGAS...AS WELL AS THE GULF WATERS. IN ADDITION...EXPECT ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH STRONG GUSTY WINDS ALONG WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A FEW WATERSPOUTS TODAY. MARINERS SHOULD KEEP A SHARP LOOKOUT FOR 
THESE DANGEROUS HAZARDS. LATER ON TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...THE 
COMBINATION OF TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO WEAKENING AND THE WESTERN

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO IS LOCATED ALMOST 400 MILES WEST OF KEY 
WEST...HEADING NORTH AT 6 KNOTS.  THE KEYS ARE NOW IN BETWEEN A MASS 
OF CONVECTION OFF OF NAPLES AND A MASS OF CONVECTION OVER 
CUBA...WITH ONLY LIGHT RAIN ACROSS OUR ISLANDS.  WINDS OVER THE 
LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS ARE 15 TO 20 KNOTS...WITH POLASKI READING NEAR 
25 KNOTS...WHILE THE UPPER KEYS WATERS ARE SEEING WINDS CLOSER TO 15 
KNOTS.  

MAIN QUESTION IS WHETHER AN SCA IS STILL WARRANTED FOR THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS ACROSS THE ATLANTIC WATERS OFF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS.  
WHILE DROPPING IT IS TEMPTING...WINDS ARE CLOSE TO CRITERIA AND MORE 
CONVECTION COULD MOVE INTO THE STRAITS...KICKING UP WINDS AND SEAS A 
BIT.  WILL LEAVE IT IN PLACE OVERNIGHT.  

---------------------------------------------------------------------
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION

.FORECAST...
THE DEEP CONVECTION ON THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF ALBERTO REMAINS WELL 
REMOVED FROM ITS LOW LEVEL CENTER OF CIRCULATION. THIS IS DUE TO 
INCREASING SHEAR OVER THE SYSTEM. HOWEVER...THE BAND OF STRONG 
CONVECTION REMAINS FAIRLY ACTIVE...WITH HELP OF HIGHLY CONVERGENT 
FLOW IN THE EASTERN GULF AND WESTERN CARIBBEAN SEA...AND DIFFLUENT 
FLOW ALOFT. CURRENT REASONING IS THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH OF A 
BREAK IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE TO ALLOW THE SURFACE 
CIRCULATION TO PUSH NORTHEASTWARD. SURFACE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY VEER 
OVERNIGHT TO MORE SOUTHWESTERLY BY TOMORROW. WINDS ACROSS ISLAND 
LOCATIONS WILL GENERALLY REMAIN AT THEIR RELATIVE STRENGTHS...BUT 
VEER SLOWLY. AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN WILL CONTINUE WITH A COUPLE MORE 
ROUNDS OF SHOWER BANDS EXPECTED...ESPECIALLY AS ALBERTO BEGINS TO 
SHIFT NORTHEASTWARD...AND THE MAIN BAND OF DEEP CONVECTION MOVES 
CLOSER TO THE KEYS. WILL KEEP POPS AT 60 PERCENT FOR TONIGHT.

ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW THROUGH THE LOWER 
TROPOSPHERE WILL ALLOW ANY CONVECTION OVER CUBA TO QUICKLY CROSS THE 
STRAITS AND IMPACT THE KEYS. WILL KEEP THE ONGOING 50 PERCENT CHANCE 
OF RAIN FOR THESE PERIODS. BY TUESDAY...THE SURFACE ATLANTIC RIDGE 
WILL BE SHIFTING TO NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA. WINDS WILL RELAX 
SIGNIFICANTLY MAINLY OUT OF THE SOUTH. LIGHTER FLOW WITH SKIES 
BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY WILL ALLOW FOR NEAR NORMAL POPS AND TEMPS. IN 
THE EXTENDED...A MID LATITUDE TROUGH WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE 
SOUTHER STATES...AND THE ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BE LOCATED 
NEAR THE KEYS. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AT 
TIMES...PREVAILING EASTERLY. WILL MAINTAIN CURRENT FORECAST FOR THE 
SECOND HALF OF THIS WEEK.
---------------------------------------------------------------------

&&

.MARINE...
TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO IN THE 
SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND AN ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE 
STRETCHING ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA WILL RESULT IN FRESH TO STRONG 
MAINLY SOUTHEAST WINDS ACROSS KEYS WATERS TONIGHT. THE STRONGEST 
WINDS WILL BE ACROSS THE WESTERNMOST WATERS. STRONGER WINDS WILL 
ACCOMPANY PERIODIC FAST MOVING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. NO CHANGES 
PLANNED FOR THE MARINE FORECAST. 
&&

.AVIATION...
OCCASIONAL MVFR VISIBILITIES EXPECTED FOR THE FIRST HALF OF TONIGHT 
ACROSS THE KMIA-TO-KEYW FLIGHT ROUTE AS AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN AND 
DRIZZLE CONTINUE TO SPREAD THROUGH THE REGION. OVERNIGHT AND TOWARDS 
DAWN WIDELY SCATTERED MVFR VIS AND CEILINGS IN SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
IFR IN THUNDER CAN BE EXPECTED. 

AT THE KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS...SOME CROSSWINDS WILL CONTINUE WITH 
SURFACE WIND VECTOR OUT OF 140/12-15KT. EXPECT WINDS TO VEER 
GRADUALLY TOWARD 160/12KT BY 15Z MONDAY. 

AVIATORS...CURRENT ZMA SIGMENT FOR TURBULENCE FROM FL150 TO FL300 IN 
THE AIRSPACE DUE TO HIGH ALTITUDE WIND SHEAR CAUSED BY TROPICAL 
STORM ALBERTO. ALSO PLEASE SEE LATEST AIRMETS FOR THIS TURBULENCE

TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO CONTINUES TO MEANDER IN THE SOUTHERN GULF. 
THE BROAD ARC OF CONVECTION ALONG ITS EASTERN PERIPHERY STRETCHES 
OVER THE EASTERN GULF...ACROSS WESTERN CUBA...AND INTO THE WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN. AFTER MORNING CONVECTION...MUCH OF THE STRONGER ACTIVITY 
HAS BEEN FOCUSED OVER THE GULF WATERS WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE...AND 
OVER GULF AND STRAITS WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST. ONLY LIGHT RAIN HAS 
BEEN AFFECTING MOST OF THE KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. THE PRESSURE 
GRADIENT BETWEEN AN ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDING INTO FLORIDA 
AND THE STORM OUT WEST HAS KEPT SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS 15 TO 20 KNOTS 
ACROSS MOST KEYS WATERS...AND STRONGER OVER OUR WESTERN WATERS. 
ISLAND LOCATIONS HAVE BEEN RANGING BETWEEN 10 TO 20 MPH.

CIRCULATION TO PUSH NORTHEASTWARD. SURFACE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY VEER 
OVERNIGHT TO MORE SOUTHWESTERLY BY TOMORROW. WINDS ACROSS ISLAND 
LOCATIONS WILL GENERALLY REMAIN AT THEIR RELATIVE STRENGTHS...BUT 
VEER SLOWLY. AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN WILL CONTINUE WITH A COUPLE MORE 
ROUNDS OF SHOWER BANDS EXPECTED...ESPECIALLY AS ALBERTO BEGINS TO 
SHIFT NORTHEASTWARD...AND THE MAIN BAND OF DEEP CONVECTION MOVES 
CLOSER TO THE KEYS. WILL KEEP POPS AT 60 PERCENT FOR TONIGHT.

ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW THROUGH THE LOWER 
TROPOSPHERE WILL ALLOW ANY CONVECTION OVER CUBA TO QUICKLY CROSS THE 
STRAITS AND IMPACT THE KEYS. WILL KEEP THE ONGOING 50 PERCENT CHANCE 
OF RAIN FOR THESE PERIODS. BY TUESDAY...THE SURFACE ATLANTIC RIDGE 
WILL BE SHIFTING TO NEAR SOUTH FLORIDA. WINDS WILL RELAX 
SIGNIFICANTLY MAINLY OUT OF THE SOUTH. LIGHTER FLOW WITH SKIES 
BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY WILL ALLOW FOR NEAR NORMAL POPS AND TEMPS. IN 
THE EXTENDED...A MID LATITUDE TROUGH WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE 
SOUTHER STATES...AND THE ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BE LOCATED 
NEAR THE KEYS. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE AT 
TIMES...PREVAILING EASTERLY. WILL MAINTAIN CURRENT FORECAST FOR THE 
SECOND HALF OF THIS WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
POORLY DEFINED TROPICAL STORM ALBERTO CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHWEST 
OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. SIGNIFICANT SOUTHWESTERLY UPPER 
LEVEL SHEAR HAS KEPT THIS SYSTEM FROM BECOMING FURTHER ORGANIZED. A 
LARGE SWATH DEEP MOIST CONVERGENT FLOW ARCS ALONG THE EASTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE SYSTEM. THIS IS RESULTING IN A BAND OF QUICK MOVING 
STRONG SHOWERS WITH EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS BLANKETING THE 
SOUTHEASTERN GULF...SOUTH FLORIDA...THE KEYS...AND WESTERN CUBA. THE 
OTHER SIGNIFICANT FEATURE AFFECTING KEYS WEATHER IS A LOWER 
TROPOSPHERIC RIDGE BUILDING WESTWARD ACROSS FLORIDA AND THE EASTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO. PRESSURE THE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE 
STORM AND THE RIDGE HAS RESULTING IN A STIFF PRESSURE GRADIENT. 
SURFACE WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS IS SOUTHEASTERLY AT 15 TO 20 MPH WITH 
STRONGER GUSTS IN SHOWERS.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (THIS AFTERNOON)...
ALBERTO WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHWESTWARD FURTHER FROM THE KEYS 
AREA. HOWEVER...THE BROAD BAND OF RAIN AND HEAVIER SHOWERS WILL 
REMAIN OVER THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. AT THIS TIME THE KEYS 
ARE IN A LULL...WITH ONLY LIGHT RAIN ACROSS MOST ISLAND LOCATIONS. 
BUT CONTINUED LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE...UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE...AND A 
MOIST AND FAIRLY UNSTABLE FLOW WILL KEEP LIKELY HEAVY SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON. NO CHANGES PLANNED FOR THE LOCAL 
FORECAST.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
GOES-12 WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS AN ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE STREAMING 
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA...THE FLORIDA KEYS...AND DOWN 
INTO THE EXTREME NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS 
DEPICTS EXTREMELY POORLY ORGANIZED TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE LOCATED 
ABOUT 200 MILES NORTH OF THE EXTREME NORTHEAST PORTION OF THE 
YUCATAN PENINSULA...IN THE SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. ACROSS THE 
MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE EAST TO  
SOUTHEAST WINDS RANGING FROM 10 TO 15 KNOTS ON THE EASTERN STRAITS 
AND FLORIDA BAY...TO NEAR 20 KNOTS WITH GUSTS OF 25 KNOTS OVER THE 
WESTERN STRAITS INCLUDING DRY TORTUGAS LIGHT. LOCAL RADARS ARE 
DETECTING SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
OVER OUR ENTIRE REGION. 

.FORECAST...
STRUGGLING TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE...LOCATED NORTH OF THE EXTREME 
NORTHEAST PORTION OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...CONTINUES TO LIFT 
SLOWLY NORTH NORTHWEST AROUND THE OUTER PERIPHERY OF THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE. THE COMBINATION OF STRONG SOUTHWEST SHEAR ALOFT AND 
SIGNIFICANT DRY AIR OVER MOST OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE GULF OF 
MEXICO WILL KEEP THIS SYSTEM VERY WEAK AS IT MIGRATES TOWARD THE 
NORTH. DESPITE THE SYSTEM REMAINING DISORGANIZED...GOOD UPPER 
LEVEL DIVERGENCE COMBINED WITH AN ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE WITHIN THE 
DEEP SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH FLOW WILL PROMPT CATEGORICAL POPS TODAY AND 
LIKELY POPS TONIGHT. MOREOVER...THE MAIN HAZARDS WILL BE POSSIBLE 
LOCAL HEAVY RAINFALL AMOUNTS WITHIN PERSISTENT...TRAINING CONVECTIVE 
BANDS...A FEW WATERSPOUTS AND STRONG GUSTY WINDS. ALL THESE HAZARDS 
WILL BE OUTLINED IN THE MORNING HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. 

ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...IF THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE SURVIVES 
OVER THE EAST CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...IT WILL BEGIN TO RECURVE 
NORTHEAST AROUND THE OUTER PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE AND A TROUGH 
DIGGING INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES...RESULTING IN A VERY MOIST 
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW. GIVEN PWAT VALUES OF AROUND 2.0 INCHES AND 
SOME INSOLATION...CLOUD LINES AND ACTIVITY MOVING NORTH OFF THE 
ISLAND OF CUBA WILL PROMPT A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AS THE DISTURBANCE 
EXITS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES...A TRAILING LOW LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
PASS THROUGH OUR REGION. WITH AMPLE MOISTURE LINGERING AND LOW LEVEL 
CONFLUENCE NEARBY...WILL INSERT 40 PERCENT POPS FOR BOTH THESE 
PERIODS. 

EXTENDED PERIOD...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)
ANOTHER MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEEPEN OVER THE EASTERN 
UNITED STATES KEEPING THE WESTERN ATLANTIC IN A WEAKENED STATE TO 
THE EAST. WITH A WEAK SURFACE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE NEARBY AND A 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE PENINSULA...AMPLE MOISTURE AND 
RATHER LIGHT WINDS SHOULD ALLOW MESOSCALE INTERACTIONS TO PROMPT LOW 
CHANCE POPS ALONG WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE PERIOD.  

&&

.MARINE...
THE PRESSURE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN RAGGED TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE AND A 
WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE REACHING INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA WILL 
RESULT IN FRESH TO STRONG SOUTHEAST WINDS...WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS 
OVER THE WATERS WEST OF KEY WEST THROUGH TONIGHT. 
FURTHERMORE...MARINERS SHOULD BE AWARE OF STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH SHOWERS AND STORMS...AS WELL AS POSSIBLE 
WATERSPOUTS. THEREAFTER...WINDS AND SEAS WILL GRADUALLY ABATE AS THE 
TROPICAL SYSTEM DISSIPATES OR LIFTS FURTHER AWAY...BUT GUSTY WINDS 
WITHIN SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL LINGER INTO TUESDAY.

.AVIATION...
LIGHT RAIN WILL PREVAIL THIS MORNING ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY 
WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WITHIN

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE A COMPLEX CIRCULATION IN THE 
VICINITY OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION 1. A BAND OF HEAVY SHOWERS FILLED IN 
QUICKLY THROUGH THE STRAITS AND ACROSS THE KEYS LATE THIS MORNING 
AND CONTINUES OFF TO OUR NORTH...WELL AHEAD OF THE THICKER COVERAGE 
OF RAIN CROSSING WESTERN CUBA. WINDS HAVE PICKED OUT OF THE 
SOUTHEAST ALL LOCATIONS...BUT MOST OF THE CMANS HAVE BEEN AFFECTED 
BY A STRONGLY DISTURBED ENVIRONMENT OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. 
TEMPERATURES TOPPED OUT IN THE MID 80S THIS AFTERNOON ALONG THE 
ISLANDS.

.FORECAST...
MAIN CONCERN FOR THIS FORECAST IS OF COURSE WHAT IS NOW TROPICAL 
DEPRESSION 1...ABOUT READY TO PULL INTO THE SOUTHEAST GULF OF 
MEXICO. THE SHORT TERM REMAIN COMPLICATED...ESPECIALLY ALONG THE 
WESTERN EXTREME OF THE SERVICE AREA...DUE TO THE COMPLEX NATURE OF 
THE DEPRESSION EVIDENT ON VISIBLE SATELLITE. REGARDLESS...MOST OF 
THE MODEL GUIDANCE IN THE SHORT TERM BRINGS THE CENTER OF 
CIRCULATION JUST WEST OF A NORTHWARD TRACK THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY AND 
THEN TENDS TO CURVE ITS PROGRESSION NORTH AND THEN NORTHEAST BY 
EARLY MONDAY MORNING. OFFICIAL NHC TRACK IS FOLLOWING THIS LINE OF 
THINKING...AND THIS WILL KEEP THE BRUNT OF WINDS WELL WEST OF THE 
SERVICE AREA. HOWEVER...SATELLITE AND KBYX RADAR INDICATE THAT 
INTERVALS OF HEAVY RAINS AREA LIKELY ACROSS THE KEYS BEGINNING LATER 
THIS EVENING/TONIGHT AND LASTING THROUGH MUCH OF SUNDAY. THE LATEST 
GRIDS ELEVATED THE POPS SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE NEXT 36 HOURS AND 
ALSO THE QPF. THE ZONES WILL HIGHLIGHT PERIODS OF HEAVY RAINS 
THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY. THIS MAY NEED TO BE EXTENDED THROUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT AND POSSIBLY INTO MONDAY SHOULD THE DEEP MOISTURE NOT GET 
LIFTED NORTH OF OUR AREA. SHOULD BE BREEZY ALL LOCATIONS 
TONIGHT...AND WILL SPLIT OFF THE UPPER KEYS TO KEEP WINDS SLIGHTLY 
LOWER THERE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. WINDY WILL WORK AS A DESCRIPTOR 
FOR THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS FOR THOSE PERIODS. BY TUESDAY...IN 
WHATEVER FORM TD 1 IS AT THAT TIME...THAT SYSTEM SHOULD BE MOVING 
AWAY FROM THE NORTHEAST SECTION OF FLORIDA...ALLOWING AN ATLANTIC 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO BECOME REESTABLISHED ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA. IF 
THE GFS IS TO BE BELIEVED...DEEP MOISTURE DOES NOT CLEAR THE AREA 
FOR ANY EXTENDED TIME PERIOD NEXT WEEK. SO...WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMO THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK WITH 
TEMPERATURES AT OR JUST ABOVE AVERAGE. EXPECT COOLER DAYTIME MAXES 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY THANKS TO PLENTY OF CLOUDS AND THE RAIN EXPECTED.

&&

.MARINE...
A SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL BE IN EFFECT FOR MOST OF OUR MARINE 
SERVICE AREA. THE EXCEPTION BEING FLORIDA BAY AND THE ATLANTIC 
WATERS ADJACENT TO THE UPPER KEYS. THIS OF COURSE WILL NEED TO BE 
MONITORED IN THE SHORT TERM...WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THE 
ADVISORY EXTENDED EASTWARD. BUT AT THIS TIME...THE WORST CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED IN THOSE ZONES SHOULD BE AN EXERCISE CAUTION. MARINERS 
SHOULD KEEP IN MIND THAT RAINS SHOULD BE PERIODICALLY HEAVY WITH 
EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS ALL THE WAY INTO MONDAY. ALSO...FAST MOVING 
STORMS MAY REQUIRE MORE FREQUENT SHORT TERM MARINE WARNINGS. AS 
ALWAYS...KEEP YOURSELF INFORMED ON THE LATEST LOCAL FORECASTS AND 
ADVISORIES FROM THE NATIONAL HURRICANE CENTER. WESTERN MARINE ZONES 
MAY BE SUBJECT TO QUICK UPDATES OR REFINEMENTS DUE TO THE EVOLUTION 
OF T.D. 1.

&&

.AVIATION...
AN INITIAL WAVE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE...HAS JUST ABOUT PUSHED NORTH AND 
NORTHWESTWARD THROUGH THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT ROUTE. OVERNIGHT 
AND INTO TOMORROW...FURTHER RAIN BANDS ARE EXPECTED TO PUSH THROUGH 
THE ROUTE AND ISLAND TERMINALS...PRODUCING PERIODS WITH WIND GUSTS 
IN EXCESS OF 35 KNOTS....BLINDING DOWNPOURS...AND A FEW LIGHTNING 
STRIKES. CELL MOTION WILL GENERALLY BE NORTHWESTWARD AT AROUND 25 TO 
30 KNOTS. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM DISTURBED WEATHER WILL BE 
SOUTHEASTERLY AT AROUND 15 TO 20 KNOTS AND GUSTY...BUT WITH PEAKS

AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN NOW TROPICAL 
DEPRESSION 1. CLOSER TO THE KEYS...PLENTY OF CLOUDS OVERHEAD AND 
INTO SOUTH FLORIDA AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS FROM THE 
ATLANTIC ACROSS THE SOUTH PORTION OF THE STATE. KBYX SHOWS A BROKEN 
CLUSTERN OF MODERATE TO HEAVY SHOWERS EXTENDING FROM THE VICINITY OF 
THE LOWER KEYS WESTWARD...WITH A FEW EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS. A 
LARGER AREA OF MODERATE RAIN IS PROGRESSING NORTHWARD FROM THE CUBAN 
COAST...BUT THE NORTHERN IS TENDING TO DIMINISH AS IT GETS OVER THE 
STRAITS. HOWEVER...RAIN CHANCES BY LATE AFTERNOON LOOK A LITTLE 
BETTER FOR THE ENTIRE STRETCH OF THE ISLANDS. WILL UPDATE THE GRIDS 
TO TAKE POPS INTO THE HIGH CHANCE RANGE AND DROP A DEGREE OR TWO OFF 
THE HIGH TEMPERATURES...A ZONE UPDATE WILL BE OUT SHORTLY. WILL ALSO 
INCORPORATE AN INITIAL WIND CHANGE WITH A BREEZY DESCRIPTOR AS 
SOUTHEAST WINDS HAVE PICKED UP BETWEEN THE HIGH TO OUR NORTHEAST AND 
TD1. THE LATE MORNING COASTAL WATERS UPDATE WILL HAVE SIMILAR 
ADJUSTMENTS.

TD1 IS FORECAST TO TRACK THROUGH THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE GULF OF 
MEXICO AND THEN TURN TO THE NORTHEAST AND BE NEAR NORTH FLORIDA ON 
MONDAY. FYI...A ROUGH ESTIMATE FOR THE CLOSEST APPROACH TO KEY WEST 
IS NEARLY 300 MILES TO THE WEST EARLY SUNDAY MORNING.

GOES-12 IR IMAGERY AND OBSERVATIONS REVEAL LOW PRESSURE MOVING 
NORTHWARD OVER THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN SEA...WITH A WEAK WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE REACHING ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. THE PRESSURE

CORRECTED A TYPO ERROR


.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
WITH A BROAD SURFACE TROUGH STILL TO OUR WEST OVER THE SE GULF...
AND THE ATLANTIC RIDGE POKING WEST OVER THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS TO THE 
SOUTH TIP OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...KEYS AREA WINDS ARE FROM THE SE 
EXCEPT TENDING CLOSER TO DUE SOUTH OVER UPPER KEYS WATERS AND 
PERHAPS OVER FLORIDA BAY TOO. SPEEDS AT MOST WIND GAUGES HAVE CREPT 
UP A FEW KNOTS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...WITH SUSTAINED WINDS 
12-17 KT (10 METER HEIGHT) AT MARINE SITES ON THE REEF AND ON THE 
BAYSIDE...GUSTING TO 15 KT ISLAND AIRPORTS. OF IMPORTANCE IS 
PROGRESS OF THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN. MOORED 
BUOYS, SHIP AND SHORE REPORTS ARE SHOWING FALLING PRESSURES...AND
SUGGEST A BROAD CIRCULATION CENTER SOMEWHERE BETWEEN GRAND CAYMAN 
AND THE EASTERN YUCATAN COAST. SATELLITE CONTINUES TO SHOW REPEATED 
HIGH-TOPPED CONVECTION OVER THE AREA...AND DURING THE PAST HOUR OR 
TWO CONVECTION HAS TAKEN ON A SLIGHT BANDED APPEARANCE ON THE EAST 
SIDE OF THE SUPPOSED-CIRCULATION. MEANWHILE...DIURNAL CONVECTION DID 
NOT FIRE OVER CUBA AS IT DID 24 HOURS AGO...AND OUR LOCAL RADAR 
CURRENTLY SHOWS LITTLE SHOWER ACTIVITY WITHIN THE KEYS AREA. THERE 
ARE SOME NARROW BOUNDARIES OR CLOUD LINES IN THE STRAITS. 

.FORECAST...
DESPITE CURRENT LACK OF PRECIP ECHOES NEAR THE KEYS...IM HESITANT 
TO DOWNGRADE CURRENT CHANCE OF OVERNIGHT RAIN AND FOR NOW PLAN TO 
LEAVE THE 50 PCT POP IN PLACE WITH NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES. 
MOISTURE CONTENT IS HIGHER THAN 24 HOURS AGO...AND A FEW BOUNDARIES 
ARE IN THE AREA. THE DISTURBANCE OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN STILL SEEMS 
TO UNORGANIZED FOR ANY WELL-DEFINED OUTER EDGE SUBSIDENCE TO BE 
OCCURRING.
&&

.MARINE...
WIND TRENDS OVER THE KEYS HAVE BEEN FOR SPEEDS OF THE SE TO S WINDS 
TO CREEP UP A FEW KNOTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...AND THIS MAY 
BE DUE TO FALLING PRESSURES OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THERE. I WILL INDICATE WIND SPEEDS ON 
ATLANTIC-SIDE WATERS AS AROUND 15 KNOTS OVERNIGHT...WITH SEAS 
BUILDING INTO THE 3-5 FT RANGE. VARIOUS NUMERICAL MODELS ARE 
INDICATING A TREND OF ORGANIZING AND STRENGTHENING OF THE SYSTEM
AS IT MOVES FROM THE NW CARIBBEAN TOWARD SOME PORTION OF THE 
SOUTHERN OR SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. WITH THE KEYS BETWEEN 
LOWERING PRESSURES TO OUR SW OR W...AND HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR E OR 
NE...THEN THERE MAY BE A CONTINUED INCREASE IN WINDS AND SEAS OVER 
ALL KEYS WATERS DURING THE WEEKEND. PLEASE CHECK LATEST COASTAL 
WATERS FORECASTS.
&&

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
FLIGHT ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING 
EAST OF FLORIDA COMBINED WITH DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE IN THE WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN SEA WILL ALLOW FOR LOCAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE SURFACE 
PRESSURE GRADIENT WINDS. A FEW QUICK SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY 
IMPACT THE FLIGHT ROUTE...BUT OVERALL COVERAGE WILL BE VERY VERY 
LIMITED. JUST SOME LOW CLOUDS WILL BE FOUND BETWEEN 2 AND 3 
KFT...WITH A MID-DECK OF SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUDS MOVING IN FROM 
THE SOUTH BETWEEN 8 AND 12 KFT. BRIEF MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS ARE 
POSSIBLE WITHIN ANY QUICK MOVING SHOWER OR STORM. SURFACE WINDS WILL 
AVERAGE FROM THE SOUTHEAST BETWEEN 12 AND 14 KNOTS...WITH SOME GUSTS 
NEAR 20 KNOTS.

1015 PM EDT FRI JUN 9 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
WITH A BROAD SURFACE TROUGH STILL TO OUR WEST OVER THE SE GULF...
AND THE ATLANTIC RIDGE POKING WEST OVER THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS TO THE 
SOUTH TIP OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA...KEYS AREA WINDS ARE FROM THE SE 
EXCEPT TENDING CLOSER TO DUE SOUTH OVER UPPER KEYS WATERS AND 
PERHAPS OVER FLORIDA BAY TOO. SPEEDS AT MOST WIND GAUGES HAVE CREPT 
UP A FEW KNOTS DURING THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...WITH SUSTAINED WINDS 
12-17 KT (10 METER HEIGHT) AT MARINE SITES ON THE REEF AND ON THE 
BAYSIDE...GUSTING TO 15 KT ISLAND AIRPORTS. OF IMPORTANCE IS 
PROGRESS OF THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN. MOORED 
BUOYS, SHIP AND SHORE REPORTS ARE SHOWING FALLING PRESSURES...AND
SUGGEST A BROAD CIRCULATION CENTER SOMEWHERE BETWEEN GRAND CAYMAN 
AND THE EASTERN YUCATAN COAST. SATELLITE CONTINUES TO SHOW REPEATED 
HIGH-TOPPED CONVECTION OVER THE AREA...AND DURING THE PAST HOUR OR 
TWO CONVECTION HAS TAKEN ON A SLIGHT BANDED APPEARANCE ON THE EAST 
SIDE OF THE SUPPOSED-CIRCULATION. MEANWHILE...DIURNAL CONVECTION DID 
NOT FIRE OVER CUBA AS IT DID 24 HOURS AGO...AND OUR LOCAL RADAR 
CURRENTLY SHOWS LITTLE SHOWER ACTIVITY WITHIN THE KEYS AREA. THERE 
ARE SOME NARROW BOUNDARIES OR CLOUD LINES IN THE STRAITS. 

.FORECAST...
DESPITE CURRENT LACK OF PRECIP ECHOES NEAR THE KEYS...IM HESITANT 
TO DOWNGRADE CURRENT CHANCE OF OVERNIGHT RAIN AND FOR NOW PLAN TO 
LEAVE THE 50 PCT POP IN PLACE WITH NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES. 
MOISTURE CONTENT IS HIGHER THAN 24 HOURS AGO...AND A FEW BOUNDARIES 
ARE IN THE AREA. THE DISTURBANCE OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN STILL SEEMS 
TO UNORGANIZED FOR ANY WELL-DEFINED OUT SUBSIDENCE TO BE OCCURRING. 
&&

.MARINE...
WIND TRENDS OVER THE KEYS HAVE BEEN FOR SPEEDS OF THE SE TO S WINDS 
TO CREEP UP A FEW KNOTS OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS...AND THIS MAY 
BE DUE TO FALLING PRESSURES OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE TROPICAL DISTURBANCE THERE. I WILL INDICATE WIND SPEEDS ON 
ATLANTIC-SIDE WATERS AS AROUND 15 KNOTS OVERNIGHT...WITH SEAS 
BUILDING INTO THE 3-5 FT RANGE. VARIOUS NUMERICAL MODELS ARE 
INDICATING A TREND OF ORGANIZING AND STRENGTHENING OF THE SYSTEM
AS IT MOVES FROM THE NW CARIBBEAN TOWARD SOME PORTION OF THE 
SOUTHERN OR SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. WITH THE KEYS BETWEEN 
LOWERING PRESSURES TO OUR SW OR W...AND HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR E OR 
NE...THEN THERE MAY BE A CONTINUED INCREASE IN WINDS AND SEAS OVER 
GULF WATERS DURING THE WEEKEND. PLEASE CHECK LATEST COASTAL WATERS 
FORECASTS.
&&

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI 
FLIGHT ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING 
EAST OF FLORIDA COMBINED WITH DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE IN THE WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN SEA WILL ALLOW FOR LOCAL ENHANCEMENT OF THE SURFACE 
PRESSURE GRADIENT WINDS. A FEW QUICK SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAY 
IMPACT THE FLIGHT ROUTE...BUT OVERALL COVERAGE WILL BE VERY VERY 
LIMITED. JUST SOME LOW CLOUDS WILL BE FOUND BETWEEN 2 AND 3 
KFT...WITH A MID-DECK OF SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUDS MOVING IN FROM 
THE SOUTH BETWEEN 8 AND 12 KFT. BRIEF MVFR/IFR CONDITIONS ARE 
POSSIBLE WITHIN ANY QUICK MOVING SHOWER OR STORM. SURFACE WINDS WILL 
AVERAGE FROM THE SOUTHEAST BETWEEN 12 AND 14 KNOTS...WITH SOME GUSTS 
NEAR 20 KNOTS.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENTLY...
IR SATELLITE INDICATES THE CONTINUOUSLY EVOLVING AND COMPLEX 
STRUCTURE TO TROPICAL DEPRESSION ONE MOVING GENERALLY NORTH 
NORTHWEST THROUGH THE YUCATAN CHANNEL. AS OF 900 PM THERE IS A WIDE 
RANGE OF WEATHER CONDITIONS ACROSS THE KEYS...WITH OVERCAST DRY 
CONDITIONS IN THE UPPER KEYS...PERIODIC DOWNPOURS WITH SHOWERS AND 
ENCROACHING LIGHT RAIN IN THE MIDDLE KEYS...AND STEADY LIGHT RAIN IN 
THE LOWER KEYS. TEMPERATURES ARE JUST NOW SLIPPING INTO THE UPPER 
70S...WITH WINDS 10 TO 15 KNOTS ALONG THE REEF FROM MARATHON 
NORTHWARD...AROUND 20 KNOTS ALONG THE LOWER KEYS...AND 25 TO 30 
KNOTS NEAR DRY TORTUGAS. GUSTS TO 48 KNOTS WERE RECORDED EARLIER IN 
THE EVENING ON AN ELEVATED TOWER AT FORT JEFFERSON NATIONAL MONUMENT 
AT DRY TORTUGAS...AS WELL AS A 42 KNOT MOMENTARY GUST MEASURED AT 
PULASKI SHOAL LIGHT.

SHORT TERM FORECAST...TONIGHT
THE LOOSELY ARRANGED PRECIPITATION AREAS ALONG THE EAST SEMICIRCLE 
OF THE TROPICAL DEPRESSION WILL KEEP ROUNDS OF RAIN WITH EMBEDDED 
THUNDERSTORMS CROSSING THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS. EVENING SOUNDING 
AT KEY WEST INDICATED PRECIPITABLE WATER ABOVE 2 INCHES...BUT AROUND 
1.77 INCHES WAS MEASURED AT MIAMI. WHILE THERE IS DRIER AIR ACROSS 
THE MAINLAND AT 750 MB...INTERESTING BOTH SOUNDINGS INDICATED A 
LAYER OF EAST WINDS WHICH COINCIDED WITH A DRY LAYER ABOVE 500 MB AT 
MIAMI. NOTING THE HIGH ALTOSTRATUS EARLIER IN THE DAY AT KEY 
WEST...PERHAPS THIS DRY AIR IS ERODING THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE 
CYCLONES PRECIPITATION FIELD AS IT TRIES TO ADVANCE. 

IN THE GUIDANCE...GFS AND NAM ARE SIMILAR IN POSITIONING OF THE 
CYCLONE THE NEXT 12 HOURS...HOWEVER GFS SHOWS THE MORE SPRAWLING 
CONVECTIVE PATTERN WHILE THE NAM TRIES TO TIGHTEN UP THE 
PRECIPITATION FIELD TOWARDS ONE CENTER. THE GFS APPEARS MORE ON THE 
MARK...AND JUSTIFIES LIKELY POPS OVERNIGHT. RECENTLY THE EVENING 
SOUNDING AND VAD WIND PROFILE FROM KBYX IS SHOWING LESS VEERING WIND 
IN THE LOW LEVELS. OVER THE UPPER KEYS...THE ENVIRONMENT IS 
CERTAINLY SUPPORTIVE OF CONVECTION...HAS A BIT MORE VEERING WIND 
PROFILE OFF THE KMFL SOUNDING BUT IS HAVING TROUBLE FIGHTING THE DRY 
AIR. MAY NEED TO REDUCE POPS TEMPORARILY OVERNIGHT OVER THE UPPER 
KEYS BACK TO HIGH CHANCE. PLANNING ON RELEASING ZONES VERY SOON 
AFTER 10 PM. 

&&

.MARINE...
HAD A FEW HOURS OF STRONG WINDS REPORTED AT FORT JEFFERSON AT DRY 
TORTUGAS BACKED UP BY OBSERVATIONS AT PULASKI SHOAL C-MAN. THESE 
WINDS HAVE BEEN GRADUALLY DECREASING BUT STILL REMAIN ALMOST 10 
KNOTS HIGHER THAN SAND KEY. SMALL CRAFT ADVISORY WILL CONTINUE OVER 
THE WATERS WEST OF CRAIG KEY AND GULF WATERS. GFS MARINE GUIDANCE 
CORRECTLY SHOWS LIGHTER WINDS IN THE BAY AND EASTERN WATERS EARLY 
THIS EVENING WITH INCREASING TREND. MAY USE SOME TREND WORDING FOR 
THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD ON THOSE WATERS DEPENDING ON 10 PM OBSERVATIONS.

&&

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...AS TD ONE MOVES TOWARDS THE GULF OF MEXICO...WILL SEE 
BROKEN TO OVERCAST VFR CEILINGS BETWEEN 8000 AND 12000 FEET ON THE 
MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE FOUND HERE WITH BRIEF MVFR/VFR CONDITIONS POSSIBLE. 

OVER THE WATER PORTION OF THE ROUTE AND THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND 
TERMINALS. WILL SEE VFR CEILINGS PREVAILING BETWEEN 4500 AND 6000 
FEET...WITH PERIODIC MVFR/IFR CEILINGS DEVELOPING BETWEEN 6Z AND 12Z 
TONIGHT AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS IN POCKETS OF FAST 
MOVING HEAVIER RAINSHOWERS AND RAINBANDS. WILL SEE ISOLATED WIND 
GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 35 KNOTS....BLINDING DOWNPOURS WITH VISIBILITY 
REDUCED BELOW 1 MILE...AS WELL AS A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES WITHIN  
RAINBANDS. CELL MOTION WILL GENERALLY BE NORTHWESTWARD BETWEEN 20 
AND 30 KNOTS. SUSTAINED SURFACE WINDS AT KMTH WILL INCREASE TO NEAR 
15 KNOTS BY LATE...AND BETWEEN 20 AND 25 KNOTS AT KEYW...WITH SOME 
PEAKS AND LULLS. SOME GUSTS BETWEEN 30 AND 35 KNOTS ARE LIKELY AT 
BOTH KEYW AND KMTH TERMINALS.

310 PM EDT FRI JUN 9 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK TROUGH CONTINUES TO MOVE SLOWLY WESTWARD ACROSS SOUTHERN 
FLORIDA. THE SOUTHERN EXTENT IS EXTENDING FROM WESTERN CUBA INTO THE 
WESTERN CARIBBEAN...WHERE STRONGER CONVECTION HAS BEEN FLARING EARLY 
THIS AFTERNOON. KBYX IS SHOWING ONLY ISOLATED ECHOES OUT IN THE 
STRAITS AND A FEW STRONGER CELLS PULLING TOWARDS KEY WEST. THE 
SOUTHERN TIP OF THE MAINLAND HAS HAD MODERATE TO HEAVY SHOWERS WITH 
A FEW THUNDERSTORMS EMBEDDED OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS. CLOUDY SKIES 
HAVE STAYED OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE ISLAND...BUT ARE STEADILY 
ENCROACHING. WINDS HAVE TURNED TO THE SOUTHEAST MOST LOCATIONS AND 
ARE BETWEEN 10 TO 15 KNOTS AT THE CMANS...VEERED SLIGHTLY MORE OVER 
THE GULF WATERS. TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN CLOSE TO 90 ALL LOCATIONS 
ALONG THE ISLAND CHAIN THIS AFTERNOON.

.FORECAST...
ALL SHORT RANGE MODELS PULL THE DEEP MOISTURE THAT IS CURRENTLY 
ORIENTED NE/SW OFF TO OUR EAST ACROSS THE ISLANDS AND INTO THE 
SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO BY EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. BUT LIFT IS 
LACKING EVEN WITH A DEEPER SOUTHEAST WIND FIELD...AS REFLECTED IN 
THE NAM AND GFS SHORT RANGE POP NUMBERS. BELIEVE WE STAND A BETTER 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVERNIGHT...AND WILL KEEP OUR HIGHER CHANCE THAT 
WE HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING FOR TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES ACROSS 
FLORIDA FROM THE WESTERN ATLANTIC THROUGH SATURDAY...BUT THERE IS 
NOW BETTER AGREEMENT AMONG MOST MODELS THAT PRESSURES SHOULD FALL 
MORE...NEAR OR JUST EAST OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA DURING THAT TIME. 
TIMING DIFFERENCES REMAIN...BUT THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT AT 
LEAST A WEAK CIRCULATION WILL BE MOVING NORTHWARD THROUGH THE 
CENTRAL PORTION OF THE GULF LATER THIS WEEKEND...AND THEN 
APPROACHING NORTHERN FLORIDA BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. HAVE DECIDED TO 
RAISE POPS BY 10 PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD FROM SATURDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH EARLY TUESDAY AS WE STAY ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF WHATEVER 
TRANSPIRES IN THE GULF. GFS BRINGS WINDS UP BY A GOOD 10 KNOTS OVER 
THE WESTERN HALF OF THE SERVICE AREA FROM LATE SUNDAY THROUGH EARLY 
TUESDAY...AND VEERED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM PREVIOUS RUNS. HAVE UPPED 
OUR WINDS DURING THOSE TIMES AND TURNED WINDS MORE TOWARDS THE 
SOUTH...BUT NOT AS AGRESSIVELY AS THE GFS. BROAD HIGH PRESSURE 
EXTENDS ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA FROM THE ATLANTIC THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
TIMES OF THE FORECAST...BUT DEEP MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN ALIGNED 
NEARBY. WILL LEAVE POPS JUST ABOVE CLIMO FOR TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
OF NEXT WEEK. ONLY MINOR TEMPERATURE CHANGES WERE INCORPORATED IN 
THE LATEST GRIDS...DUE MOSTLY TO MORE PESSIMISTIC SKY COVERAGE THIS 
WEEKEND.

&&

.MARINE...
AGAIN...BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE MOVEMENT OF LOWER PRESSURE THROUGH 
THE GULF LATE THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. AT THIS TIME...NO 
ADVISORY HEADLINES ARE EXPECTED FOR ANY FORECAST PERIOD...BUT HAD TO 
UP THE WINDS AND VEER THEM MORE TOWARDS THE SOUTH FROM SUNDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH EARLY TUESDAY. WILL ALSO EMPHASIZE SLIGHTLY HIGHER WIND 
GUSTS AND SEAS WEST OF MARQUESAS KEYS DURING THAT TIME.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KEY WEST TO MIAMI FLIGHT ROUTE 
AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE MAINLAND PORTION OF THE ROUTE WILL DIMINISH 
THIS EVENING. ALSO ISOLATED MVFR SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED ACROSS THE 
REMAINDER OF THE ROUTE. SURFACE WINDS IN UNDISTURBED ENVIRONMENTS 
WILL GENERALLY BE SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 10 KNOTS.

&&

.PRELIMINARY TEMPS AND POPS...

.DISCUSSION...
WEAK TROUGH CONTINUES TO MIGRATE WESTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIP OF 
FLORIDA AND THE LOWER KEYS INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF. AS A 
RESULT...WINDS OVER MUCH OF THE SERVICE AREA HAVE SHIFTED TO THE 
SOUTHEAST AND HAVE PICKED UP A FEW KNOTS ON AVERAGE OVER THE PAST 
COUPLE OF HOURS. KBYX RADAR INDICATES A CLUSTER OF MODERATE TO HEAVY 
SHOWERS EXTENDING FROM THE GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER 
KEYS...OVER THE FLORIDA BAY...AND ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE UPPER KEYS. 
MORE ISOLATED AND WEAKER ECHOES ARE ROUGHLY 50 TO 60 NM OFF THE 
ISLAND CHAIN WELL OUT IN THE STRAITS. SLOW NORTHWESTWARD MOVEMENT IS 
INDICATED WITH ALL THE CELLS. SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY AT THIS HOUR 
WITH TEMPERATURES ALREADY IN THE MIDDLE 80S. WILL BE SENDING A ZONE 
UPDATE TO ADJUST THE INITIAL WIND CONDITIONS TO THE SOUTHEAST AND UP 
THE SPEEDS. WILL KEEP THE SMALL CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
IN THE FORECAST THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...BUT SKIES SHOULD REMAIN 
PARTLY CLOUDY FOR THE MOST PART. SIMILARLY...THE LATE MORNING MARINE 
UPDATE WILL HAVE HIGHER INITIAL WINDS OUT OF THE SOUTHEAST FOR THE 
ATLANTIC AND BAY WATERS...GULF WATERS WILL TAKE A FEW MORE HOURS TO 
SWITCH TO THE SOUTHEAST.

==================================================================
.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
IN WAKE OF THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WHICH TRAVERSED OUR AREA DURING 
LATE THURSDAY NIGHT...OUR ATMOSPHERE HAS STABILIZED CONSIDERABLY 
WITH NO PRECIPITATION BEING DETECTED SOUTH OF THE MAINLAND MONROE 
COASTAL WATERS. GOES-12 IR IMAGES SHOW MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS 
ARE SLOWLY EVAPORATING...BUT WITH SEVERAL LARGE AND STRONG CLUSTERS 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LINGERING OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN 
SEA. THESE ROBUST AREAS OF DEEP CONVECTION (-67 DEGREES C) ARE 
PRIMARILY BEING GENERATED BY SIGNIFICANT MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
DIFFLUENCE ON THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF A DEEP TROUGH. 
MEANWHILE...ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM 
OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS. 

.FORECAST...
A MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES INTO THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA WILL LIFT NORTHWARD AND INTO THE ATLANTIC...WITH A 
SOUTHERN PIECE OF VORTICITY LINGERING OVER THE YUCATAN PENINSULA AND 
EXTREME NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN SEA THROUGH SATURDAY. THIS LATTER PIECE 
OF ENERGY WILL BE SQUEEZED BETWEEN TWO AREAS OF HIGH PRESSURE...ONE 
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...AND THE OTHER OVER OLD MEXICO. 
MEANWHILE...A PERSISTENT SURFACE BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE 
WESTERN CARIBBEAN...WITH A TROUGH REACHING INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO TODAY...WILL GRADUALLY MIGRATE WESTWARD OVER THE NEXT COUPLE 
OF DAYS. WITH DECREASING WIND SHEAR AND GOOD UPPER LEVEL 
DIFFLUENCE...MOST MEDIUM RANGE MODELS INDICATE LOW PRESSURE WILL 
FORM BEFORE REACHING THE YUCATAN PENINSULA TONIGHT...AND THEN 
GUIDE IT INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO SATURDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT. 
DESPITE PLENTY OF UNCERTAINTY ON ANY DEVELOPMENT AND TRACK OF THIS 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE...A DEEPENING SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH FLOW SHOULD 
PROVIDE MODERATE INSTABILITY AND CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE (PWAT VALUES 
ABOVE 1.75 INCHES) THROUGH AT LEAST THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 
HENCE...ABOVE NORMAL POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED. FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT...WITH OUR AREA BETWEEN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC HIGH AND A TROUGH 
OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO...AMPLE AMPLE MOISTURE 
WITHIN A SOUTHEAST FLOW WILL PROMPT AT LEAST LOW CHANCE POPS ALONG 
WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.  

EXTENDED PERIOD...(MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY) GFSLR TAKES THE AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...AND LIFTS IT 
QUICKLY ACROSS EXTREME NORTHEAST FLORIDA TUESDAY...BEFORE MOVING  
WELL OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC. IN COMPARISON...ECMWF IS ABOUT 4 MB 
WEAKER...AND MUCH SLOWER LIFTING THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OFFSHORE 
OF THE GEORGIA COAST LATE WEDNESDAY. MEANWHILE...A WEAK WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL SETTLE SOUTHWARD NEAR OUR REGION. WITH PLENTY OF 
UNCERTAINTY ON THE TRACK AND DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SYSTEM...WILL 
MAINTAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL POPS AND NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
&&

.MARINE...
A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN WILL MIGRATE 
SLOWLY WEST NORTHWEST...AS A WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE GRADUALLY NOSES 
ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. MAIN QUESTION BECOMES WHETHER LOW 
PRESSURE FORMS OVER THE EXTREME NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN OR IN THE 
SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. EVEN IF THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE REMAINS 
POORLY ORGANIZED...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT SHOULD TIGHTEN SOMEWHAT 
BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS. HENCE...WILL INCREASE WINDS A TOUCH THIS

FORECAST AREA...WITH OUR NEWLY-INSTALLED-AND-STILL-WORKING C-MAN AT 
PULASKI SHOALS IN DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK HAVING SHOWN AN EAST 
WIND TURN TO SE AND PICK UP A BIT IN SPEED (GUSTY TO 13 KT) OVER THE 
PAST FEW HOURS. WIND GAUGES OVER ALL THE KEYS ARE NOW SHOWING SE TO 
S WINDS. FOR THE FIRST TIME IN MANY MONTHS...A LOW LEVEL SE TO S 
WIND FLOW ALLOWED CUBAN DIURNAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO CREEP 
NORTH INTO THE STRAITS DURING LATE AFTERNOON...AFTER WHICH SECONDARY 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ALONG OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES CONTINUED TO 
PROPAGATE A FEW CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
TOWARD THE KEYS. DOPPLER RADAR PEGGED LOWEST LEVEL BASE VELOCITIES 
JUST OVER 30 KT WITH THE MAIN SHOWERS WHICH CROSSED INTO NEARSHORE 
WATERS AND AFFECTED ISLAND LOCATIONS. RATHER LARGE-SCALE AND 
PERSISTENT SOUTH WINDS 15 KT OR SO GUSTING TO OVER 20 KT HAVE

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDS FROM NEW ENGLAND...ALONG THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD...AND INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. IMPRESSIVE UPPER 
LEVEL DIFFLUENCE IS EXHIBITED ON SATELLITE...WHERE CIRRUS JUST SOUTH 
OF CUBA IS MOVING NORTHEASTWARD...WHILE OVER THE EXTREME WESTERN 
CARIBBEAN MOVEMENT IS TO THE SOUTH SOUTHEAST. AT THE SURFACE TROUGH 
EXTENDS JUST EAST OF NEW ENGLAND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN STATES. JUST 
SOUTH OF THIS TROUGH AN ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS INTO CENTRAL 
FLORIDA...WHILE A PERSISTENT BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE REMAINS IN 
THE SOUTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN. SURFACE WINDS ARE EAST TO SOUTHEASTERLY  
AT 10 TO 15 MPH. SATELLITE AND RADAR INDICATE SCATTERED CONVECTION 
DEVELOPING ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA...WITH ONLY ISOLATED ACTIVITY ACROSS 
OUR WESTERNMOST WATERS. THIS MORNINGS SOUNDING INDICATED A 
CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH AMPLE CAPE AND WEAK CAPPING. 

.FORECAST...
OVERNIGHT...THE SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE STATES WILL ROTATE FURTHER 
EASTWARD AND THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SHIFT A BIT FURTHER SOUTH 
TOWARD SOUTH FLORIDA. WINDS WILL REMAIN GENERALLY SOUTHEASTERLY 
ACROSS MOST KEYS LOCATION. CONTINUED DRY MID LEVELS WILL KEEP 
COVERAGE DOWN DESPITE THE CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE AND WEAKLY CAPPED 
ATMOSPHERE. WILL MAINTAIN ONGOING FORECAST FOR THE OVERNIGHT AND 
FRIDAY PERIODS. 
THE ELONGATED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES AND THE 
GULF OF MEXICO WILL LIFT OUT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...LEAVING 
A WEAK TROUGH OVER THE GULF...SEPARATING HIGH PRESSURE AREAS 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE BAJA PENINSULA...AS WELL AS 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL CARIBBEAN. AS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH LIFTS 
OUT...THE SUBTROPICAL JET WILL SHIFT FURTHER NORTH. A WEAK SURFACE 
TROUGH EXTENDING OVER CUBA AND THE OUTER STRAITS WILL ALSO SHIFT 
FURTHER NORTH...AS THE ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE ATTEMPTS TO BUILD 
WESTWARD OVER SOUTH FLORIDA. INCREASED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND 
SLIGHTLY MORE FAVORABLE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL ALLOW FOR HIGHER 
CHANCE POPS OF PRECIP FROM TOMORROW NIGHT INTO SATURDAY NIGHT.

IN THE EXTENDED...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL DEVELOP OVER THE CENTRAL 
CARIBBEAN...AN ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BUILD WESTWARD ACROSS 
CENTRAL FLORIDA...AND MORE NORMAL LOWER TROP MOISTURE LEVELS ARE 
EXPECTED. THIS WILL MEAN A CLOSER TO NORMAL NORMAL TEMPS AND POPS. 
NO CHANGES TO EXTENDED PLANNED.

&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN A RIDGE FAR TO THE NORTH AND LOWER 
PRESSURES OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN WILL KEEP GENTLE TO 
MODERATE EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZES THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THROUGH THE 
FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING WESTWARD ACROSS THE 
ATLANTIC WILL MAINTAIN GENTLE TO MODERATE EAST TO SOUTHEAST WINDS.

&&

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB 
ROUTE AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AN 
IMPULSE MOVING IN THE JETSTREAM WILL AID IN THE FORMATION OF 
ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE 
MAINLAND THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS...WITH ACTIVITY BECOMING ISOLATED

.CURRENTLY...
A LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDS FROM NEW ENGLAND...ALONG THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD...AND INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. AT THE SURFACE...AN 
ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA...WHILE A 
PERSISTENT BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE REMAINS IN THE SOUTHWESTERN 
CARIBBEAN. SURFACE WINDS ARE MAINLY EASTERLY AT AROUND 10 MPH. 
SATELLITE AND RADAR INDICATE AN EAST TO WEST LINE OF SHOWERS WITH A 
FEW EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS MOVING SLOWLY NORTHWARD ABOUT 15 MILES 
SOUTH OF THE KEYS. THIS MORNINGS SOUNDING INDICATED A CONDITIONALLY 
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH AMPLE CAPE AND WEAK CAPPING. 


KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE NEAR 80 DEGREES. ONLY 
ABOUT SIX DEGREES OF WARMING IS EXPECTED TODAY DUE TO MODERATE EAST 
TO SOUTHEAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 
80S. 

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (THIS AFTERNOON)...
THE GENERAL PATTERN WILL NOT CHANGE MUCH OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY. 
A RIDGE TO OUR NORTH AND LOWER PRESSURE SOUTHWEST OF US WILL KEEP 
WINDS OUT OF THE EAST TO SOUTHEAST THIS AFTERNOON AT AROUND 10 MPH. 
CLOUD LINES OVER THE STRAITS AND DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUD LINES 
EMANATING FROM THE KEYS WILL KEEP THE ONGOING 30 PERCENT IN THE 
FORECAST. AMPLE SUNSHINE THIS LATE MORNING SHOULD ALLOW THE KEYS TO 
REACH HIGHS NEAR 90. NO CHANGES PLANNED FOR THE LOCAL FORECAST.

&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN A RIDGE FAR TO THE NORTH AND LOWER 
PRESSURES OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN CARIBBEAN WILL KEEP GENTLE TO 
MODERATE EAST TO SOUTHEAST BREEZES THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. WINDS 
WILL BE HIGHER NEAR ISOLATED STRONGER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. NO 
CHANGES TO THE ONGOING MARINE FORECAST ANTICIPATED.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS 
AND VISIBILITIES WILL OCCUR ALONG THE ROUTE DUE TO SLOW MOVING 
SHOWERS THOUGH. A FEW STRONGER SHOWERS MAY PRODUCE IFR 
VISIBILITIES...BUT THESE WOULD BE ISOLATED AND BRIEF DURING THE 
AFTERNOON. SURFACE WINDS AT KEYW AND KMTH WILL BE EAST TO SOUTHEAST 
AT 8-12 KT.

SURFACE ANALYSIS REVEALS A HIGH PRESSURE CENTER IN THE ATLANTIC 
(ESTIMATED 1017 MB) EAST OF DAYTONA BEACH WITH AN ASSOCIATED RIDGE 
EXTENDING WNW TO GEORGIA. IN THE NW CARIBBEAN...BUOY 42056 SE OF 
COZUMEL AS AN EAST WIND 15 KT...BUOY 42057 SOUTH OF GRAND CAYMAN 
ISLAND REPORTS ESE WIND AS DO STATIONS ON GRAND CAYMAN AND JAMAICA. 
AS A RESULT...A WEAK TROUGH AXIS IS ANALYZED APPROXIMATELY FROM 
HONDURAS TO WEST CENTRAL CUBA. IR SATELLITE DISPLAYS SCATTERED 
CONVECTION CONTINUING EAST OF THE TROUGH. MEANWHILE...A RECENT (23Z) 
QUIKSCAT PASS OVER THE KEYS SHOWS THE NORTHERN EXTENSION OF THIS 
WEAK TROUGH LYING BETWEEN THE KEYS AND ANDROS ISLAND...SEPARATING 
ENE WINDS WEST OF THE TROUGH...FROM SE WINDS EAST OF THE TROUGH. 
C-MAN SITES WIND SPEEDS HAVE BEEN RUNNING A LITTLE HIGHER THAN 
EXPECTED...17 KT AT MOLASSES REEF GUSTING TO 23 KT THIS PAST HOUR.
QUIKSCAT SHOWS WINDS IN THE 15-20 KT RANGE EAST OF KEY LARGO...
10-15 KT WINDS ELSEWHERE OVER THE STRAITS...AND LESSER WINDS OVER 
KEYS GULF WATERS BUT THESE MAY BE INACCURATE NEAR THE SATELLITE 
PASS. KEY WEST EVENING SOUNDING SHOWS A SLIGHT INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE...PW= 1.54 INCH...AND SURFACE DEWPOINTS ARE UP INTO THE 
LOWER 70S. RADAR ECHOES NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS ARE A MIXTURE OF 
REAL SHOWERS AND CHAFF DROPS FROM THE AFTERNOON. ECHOES CLOSEST 
NORTH OF THE LOWER KEYS ARE SHOWERS...WHICH FORMED ON AN OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARY FROM PREVIOUS MAINLAND CONVECTION. AND...NEWLY DEVELOPED 
ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE DETECTED IN THE OUTER STRAITS NEAR THE WEAK 
TROUGH AXIS. 

.FORECAST...
NO UPDATE TO PUBLIC ZONES IS ANTICIPATED. AN EAST WIND FLOW BRINGING 
IN HIGHER MOISTURE CONTENT...AND THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT OF THAT WEAK 
TROUGH AXIS...SHOULD PROVIDE A RETURN TO AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS OVERNIGHT. 
&&

.MARINE...
E WINDS MAY TEND TO TURN TOWARD SE OVER ATLANTIC WATERS BY MORNING 
AS THE WEAK TROUGH AXIS MOVES WEST. MODELS SUGGEST THAT CURRENT WIND 
SPEEDS JUST OVER 15 KT OFF THE UPPER KEYS...WILL DROP INTO THE 10-15 
KT RANGE LIKE OTHER AREAS OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...IF LOWER PRESSURES IN 
THE NW CARIBBEAN PERSIST OR DROP LOWER...THEN ATLANTIC-SIDE WINDS 
MAY BLOW CLOSER TO 15 KT. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH MORNING ALONG THE KEY WEST TO 
MIAMI AVIATION ROUTE...AS WELL AS AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS OF KEY

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX IS DETECTING SEVERAL PATCHES OF CHAFF...MOSTLY IN THE GULF 
WATERS NORTHWEST OF THE LOWER KEYS AND JUST OFF OF MAINLAND MONROE 
COUNTY. ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE SLOWLY DRIFTING THROUGH THE STRAITS AND 
JUST OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF THE MAINLAND AT THIS TIME. A FEW 
STORMS HAVE POPPED IN WESTERN MIAMI-DADE COUNTY RECENTLY 
OTHERWISE...SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY WITH A RAGGED CLOUD LINE 
DISPLACED AND DISSIPATING TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE LOWER KEYS. WINDS 
ARE MAINLY EAST...AND THE CMAN REPORTS HAVE SHOWN AN INCREASE IN 
SPEEDS TO JUST ABOVE 10 KNOTS ON AVERAGE. ISLAND SENSORS HAVE COME 
CLOSER TO 10 MPH. TEMPERATURES ARE FLIRTING WITH 90 DEGREES ALONG 
THE ISLAND CHAIN.

.FORECAST...
A SHORTWAVE ALOFT IS WEAKENING AS IT DIPS OUT OF THE GULF COAST 
STATES THIS AFTERNOON...AND EVENTUALLY GETS ABSORBED INTO THE MEAN 
EAST COAST TROUGH. THE FLOW FLATTENS THIS WEEKEND ACROSS THE EAST 
WITH A PERSISTENT RIDGE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS REMAINING THE 
DOMINANT UPPER LEVEL FEATURE. AT THE SURFACE...THE TROUGH AXIS 
CURRENTLY EXTENDING FROM THE BAHAMAS SOUTHWESTWARD INTO THE 
CARIBBEAN HAS INDICATED A SLOW PROGRESSION TO THE WEST TODAY. MODELS 
HAVE NOT BEEN IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE SHORT TERM HANDLING THE 
PARTICULARS OF THIS FEATURE...BUT A WETTER AIRMASS WILL BE WORKING 
CLOSER TO THE KEYS OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THE NAM REMAINS 
MORE AGRESSIVE DEEPENING THE PRESSURE IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN AS 
EARLY AS FRIDAY MORNING. THE GFS LINGERS THE TROUGH AXIS CLOSER TO 
THE KEYS WITH WEAKER AND SEPARATE AREAS OF PRONOUNCED TROUGHING IN 
THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN AND WELL EAST OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA DURING 
THAT TIME. OTHERWISE...A BROAD HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA AND REMAIN INTO NEXT WEEK. MOS GUIDANCE HAS SHOWN 
FLUCTUATIONS IN POP NUMBERS THROUGH THIS WEEKEND...BUT NOT 
SIGNIFICANTLY ENOUGH TO CHANGE GRIDS A LARGE AMOUNT. WILL KEEP THE 
POPS IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE INITIALLY ALL AREAS AND SLOWLY LIFT THEM 
INTO THE CHANCE RANGE FOR EARLY THIS WEEKEND AS EVEN DEEPER MOISTURE 
NEARS. WILL BE MORE CLOSELY FOLLOWING THE GFS SOLUTION ON THIS 
FORECAST. THAT SAID...WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES JUST ABOVE CLIMO 
THROUGH THE LATE PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
EXTENDING ACROSS FLORIDA FROM THE ATLANTIC. A FEW MID LEVEL IMPULSES 
DROPPING THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST MAY RAISE OUR RAIN CHANCES LATER NEXT 
WEEK...BUT WILL HOLD THE POPS DOWN TO THE LOW CHANCE FOR THOSE TIMES.

&&

.MARINE...
A PERIOD OF 10 TO 15 KNOTS THROUGH TONIGHT DEPICTED BY ALL THE SHORT 
RANGE GUIDANCE...SO LITTLE CHANGE INDICATED IN THE GRIDS. THE NAM 
HAS BEEN MORE PRONOUNCED WITH LOWER PRESSURE IN THE WRN CARIBBEAN AS 
EARLY AS FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT THE GFS IS BEING MORE CLOSELY FOLLOWED 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE FORECAST. WILL KEEP WINDS OUT OF 
THE EAST/SOUTHEAST CLOSER TO 10 KNOTS DURING THE WEEKEND AND EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...AND NO ADVISORY OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS ARE EXPECTED.

&&

.AVIATION...
TONIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB

CONDITIONS POSSIBLE IN ANY SHOWERS.

THE WEST COAST OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. DURING THE DAY AND STILL 
CONTINUING INTO THE EVENING HOURS...A THERMAL TROUGH LIES 
SUPERIMPOSED ON THE SYNOPTIC TROUGH ALONG THE WEST COAST OF THE

SKIES WERE MOSTLY SUNNY TODAY IN THE KEYS WITH TEMPERATURES 88-90 
DEGREES AT THE REPORTING STATIONS. DEW POINT DEPRESSIONS AROUND 20 
DEGREES DROPPED OUT HUMIDITY TO AROUND 50%. FEELS GOOD. WE COULD USE 
A BREEZE...WINDS WERE FROM THE NORTH 10 KNOTS OR LESS. SATELLITE 
SHOWED JUST A FEW CLOUDS IN THE LOWER KEYS AND RADAR HAD ONLY 
NON-METEOROLOGICAL ECHOES. SATELLITE ALSO SHOWED A WIDE BAND OF 
CLOUDS AND SHOWERS FROM CUBA INTO THE BAHAMAS AND BEYOND.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
DRY AIR CONTINUES TO ENTER OUR REGION ON THOSE NORTH WINDS AIDED BY 
SUBSIDENCE OF THE SUPERIOR AIRMASS WHICH WAS SHOWN ALSO TO BE DRY ON 
OUR MORNING RAOB. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE NORTHERLIES WERE ON THE FRONT SIDE OF HIGHER PRESSURES IN THE 
SOUTHERN STATES...AND THE BACK SIDE OF LOWER PRESSURES OUT IN THE 
ATLANTIC. AS THE LOW MOVES AWAY THE HIGH WILL BUILD IN TONIGHT. THUS 
OUR RAIN CHANCES LOOK VERY SLIM AND WE HAVE REMOVED POPS TONIGHT IN 
OUR LAND ZONES. 

WITH THE HIGH BUILDING IN OUR WINDS WILL HAUL INTO THE EAST WHICH 
SIGNALS A RETURN TO MORE SEASONABLE WEATHER. 

OUR MODEL GUIDANCE IS FINALLY COMING INTO FOCUS WITH THE SYSTEM IN 
THE NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN. DEEPENING THERE WILL REINFORCE OUR EAST 
WINDS. AS THE LOW MOVES WEST TOWARD MEXICO THE PLUME OF HIGH THETA-E 
AIR SEEN ON THE IMAGERY WILL BE DRAGGED TOWARD THE KEYS. DRY AIR 
FARTHER ALOFT WILL BE PRESENT ALONG WITH NORTHERLY SHEAR SO RAINFALL 
WILL BE LIMITED FOR US. SO FAR WE HAVE PEGGED OUR CHANCES NEAR THE 
CLIMATOLOGICAL AVERAGE. THATS GOOD WHEN YOURE IN A DRY SPELL.

OVERALL WE HAVE MADE ONLY MINOR CHANGES TO GRIDS AND TEXT.

AND THURSDAY. EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY 
SHOULD MOISTEN UP THE ATMOSPHERE. BY SUNSET THURSDAY...PWAT VALUES 
SHOULD BE NEAR ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH. DUE TO THIS 
GRADUAL INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE...ADVERTISED POPS WILL 
GRADUALLY INCREASE FROM SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO 
LOW CHANCE CATEGORY THURSDAY.  
    
.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
FORECAST UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH FOR THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE 
FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS. THE ECMWF AND GFS NUMERICAL MODEL 
SOLUTIONS INDICATE A WEAK TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR THE KEYS 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. THE OTHER POSSIBLE SCENARIO 
WOULD BE AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IN THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN AND AN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE STRETCHING ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. EITHER WAY...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD EXTEND ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA SATURDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY. DUE TO A HIGH DEGREE OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY...
CONTINUITY WILL BE MAINTAINED IN THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE 
FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS.

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN WILL RESULT IN LIGHT WINDS TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED TODAY

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
330 PM EDT MON JUN 5 2006

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
THE KEYS WERE IN AND OUT OF THE SUN AND CLOUDS TODAY DUE TO THE 
FORMATION OF SEVERAL FAMILIES OF ISLAND CLOUD LINES. A SWARM OF 
FUNNEL CLOUDS AND WATERSPOUTS WAS CAUGHT ON CANDID CAMERA OFF KEY 
LARGO AT PENNEKAMP PARK AROUND 1100 AM. LOOK FOR THE PHOTOS ON OUR 
WEB SITE LATER THIS WEEK. THANKS AL. 

TEMPERATURES CLIMBED INTO THE LOWER 90S AT MARATHON AND UPPER 80S AT 
KEY WEST WHERE THERES A LITTLE LESS CONCRETE. WINDS WERE FROM THE 
NORTHWEST...MOSTLY...LESS THAN 10 MILES AN HOUR.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
THERE WERE SEVERAL FACTORS IN TODAYS ANALYSIS. A LYSING SURFACE 
FRONT LAY ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL FLORIDA. THERE WAS LITTLE 
CONTRAST ACROSS THIS BOUNDARY BUT IT DID AID LOCAL CONVERGENCE...AND 
THERE WAS SOME SLIGHT POOLING OF MOISTURE AHEAD OF IT ACCORDING TO 
MSAS. HERE IN THE ISLANDS WELL SOUTH OF THIS BOUNDARY OUR AIRFLOW 
WAS VARIABLE. 

ANOTHER FACTOR WAS MAINLAND HEATING WHICH LOWERED PRESSURES ON THE 
PENINSULA THIS AFTERNOON. AS A RESULT OUR WESTERLIES HAD TURNED INTO 
THE NORTHWEST IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS. 

FINALLY A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE EXISTED SOUTH OF CUBA IN THE 
NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN. THIS HAD A TROF EXTENDING UP INTO THE BAHAMAS 
AND WAS HOME TO A WHOLE LOT OF CLOUDS AND SHOWERS.
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE SURFACE BOUNDARY UP NORTH HAS EXHIBITED A TENDENCY TO WEAKEN OVER
THE LAST FEW DAYS. WE EXPECT THIS TO TO CONTINUE. THE MAIN EFFECT 
LOCALLY WILL BE FOR OUR NORTHERLY COMPONENT WINDS TO PERSIST AS THE 
GULF HIGH RE-FORMS. THIS IS BEHIND OUR LOW POPS FOR TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW AND THE ABSENCE OF THUNDERY WORDING. 

DIURNAL MAINLAND HEATING AND NOCTURNAL COOLING WILL PLAY ITS USUAL 
ROLE IN OUR WEATHER BY VEERING AND BACKING OUR WINDS. HOWEVER AS 
STATED THE BASIC NORTHWEST TO NORTH AIRFLOW WILL PERSIST.

THE BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA IN THE CARIBBEAN IS THE BIG QUESTION OF 
COURSE. GUIDANCE JUST CANNOT MAKE UP ITS MIND ON THE DETAILS WHICH 
CHANGE FROM DAY TO DAY...BUT THE BIG PICTURE IS EMERGING. IT SEEMS 
CLEAR THAT THIS FEATURE WILL DEEPEN. THIS WILL INCREASE THE TENDENCY 
FOR CLOUDS AND SHOWERS TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST. ALSO IT WILL TURN OUR 
SURFACE WINDS MORE EASTERLY. WHAT IS UNCLEAR IS HOW DEEP THE SYSTEM 
WILL BECOME AND IN WHICH DIRECTION IT WILL MOVE...BOTH OF WHICH WILL 
DETERMINE THE DETAILS FOR OUR SERVICE AREA. 

SO IN TODAYS FORECAST WE ARE TAKING IT ONE STEP AT A TIME. WE HAVE 
BASED OUR TEXT AND GRIDS ON CONTINUITY WITH OUR PREVIOUS 
FORECASTS...SEASONAL CLIMATOLOGY...AND NO ONE MODEL OR OTHER BUT 
RATHER WHAT THEY ALL HAVE IN COMMON. THEREFORE YOU SHOULD EXPECT 
CHANGES IN THE DETAILS. IF YOU HAVE BIG PLANS FOR THE SECOND HALF OF 
THE WEEK YOU WILL WANT TO CHECK BACK FREQUENTLY. FOR NOW WE HAVE 
GRADUALLY INCREASED OUR RAIN CHANCES. 
&&   

.MARINE...
LIGHT WINDS AND MOSTLY CALM SEAS WILL CONTINUE INTO WEDNESDAY. IN 
THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK SPEEDS WILL INCREASE TO AROUND 10 KNOTS 
WHICH WILL BEGIN TO RAISE SOME SEA. THE VESSEL LYKES DISCOVERER -- 
AN OUTSTANDING PERFORMER IN THE VOS PROGRAM -- REPORTED 5 KNOTS AND 
1 FOOT SEAS AT 18Z SOUTHWEST OF DRY TORTUGAS.
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO MIAMI...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRODUCE ONLY BRIEF CIRCUMNAVIGABLE MVFR/IFR 
CONDITIONS. OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL WITH LIGHT 
NORTHWEST WINDS BECOMING LIGHT AND VARIABLE AT THE KEY WEST AND 
MARATHON TERMINALS. ENJOY YOUR FLIGHT.
&&

PRELIMINARY TEMPS AND POPS...

KBYX DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT THE 
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE VARIABLY 
CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE VARIABLE NEAR 5 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON 
AVERAGE...ARE VARIABLE NEAR 5 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID

A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER NORTH FLORIDA TODAY 
AND TONIGHT. ELSEWHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED 
OVER THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN SEA TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE MAIN FORCING 
MECHANISM FOR PRECIPITATION TODAY WILL BE MULTIPLE OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES NEAR THE KEYS...WHICH ARE BECOMING ACTIVE TONIGHT. AS A 
RESULT...POPS WILL BE BUMPED UP TO LOW CHANCE CATEGORY FOR TODAY. NO 
CHANGES TO THE TONIGHT PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA 
KEYS. BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON...THE TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER NORTH 
FLORIDA SHOULD BE LOCATED OVER THE BAHAMAS. A MUCH DRIER AIR MASS 
WILL MAKE ITS WAY OVER THE FLORIDA KEYS TUESDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER 
(PWAT) VALUES SHOULD FALL BELOW ONE INCH TUESDAY. PWAT VALUES SHOULD 
REMAIN BELOW ONE INCH TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. DUE TO THE 
PRESENCE OF THIS DRY AIR MASS...POPS WILL BE DROPPED BY 10 PERCENT 
FOR THE TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY PORTION OF THE ZONE FORECASTS FOR 
THE FLORIDA KEYS.    

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
THE GFS NUMERICAL MODEL CONTINUES TO INDICATE SPURIOUS AREAS OF LOW 
PRESSURE DEVELOPING ALONG A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE BAHAMAS 
AND THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN SEA. THE LONG TERM PORTION OF THE ZONE 
FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE BASED UPON THE UKMET AND 
ECMWF NUMERICAL MODEL SOLUTIONS. AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BEGIN TO BUILD ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. AN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD EXTEND ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. PWAT VALUES SHOULD RISE TO NEAR 
ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. PWAT VALUES SHOULD 
REMAIN NEAR OR JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH THURSDAY

WILL BECOME SOUTHEAST AND INCREASE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS AN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA.

DEWPOINT REACHED AN UNUSUALLY LOW 62 DEGREES AT THE KEY WEST AIRPORT 
EARLY THIS AFTERNOON MAKING FOR A CHAMBER OF COMMERCE TYPE DAY HERE 
IN THE FLORIDA KEYS. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS OUR REGION IS 
BETWEEN A WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE LYING ACROSS THE ISLAND OF 
CUBA...AND A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE DROPPING INTO CENTRAL FLORIDA. 
BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS ARE INDICATING 
SOUTHWEST TO WEST WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE

BAROCLINIC ZONE WILL REMAIN OVER THE BAHAMAS AND EASTERN HALF OF THE 
ISLAND OF CUBA. HOWEVER...ENOUGH MOISTURE COMBINED WITH LIGHT WINDS 
MAY ALLOW CLOUD LINES TO FORM NEAR THE FLORIDA KEYS. HENCE...ONLY 
ISOLATED POPS AND NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL BE INSERTED FOR THIS 
TIME FRAME. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
UNTIL GFSLR CALMS DOWN WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF SPURIOUS AREAS OF LOW 
PRESSURE...WILL BE FOLLOWING UKMET AND ECMWF. THEREFORE...THE 
PERSISTENT MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
EARLY VISIBLE SATELLITE PHOTOGRAPHS SHOW MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ACROSS 
THE ISLAND CHAIN AND ADJACENT NEARSHORE WATERS...WITH PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES ELSEWHERE. GOES-12 WATER VAPOR IMAGERY INDICATE A PRONOUNCED 
MID AND UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE DROPPING SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH THE 
EXTREME SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...WITH CONSIDERABLE DRY AIR BEHIND. 
SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE LYING ACROSS 
WEST CENTRAL CUBA...WITH A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE DROPPING INTO 
NORTH CENTRAL FLORIDA. BECAUSE OF THE ORIENTATION OF THESE TWO 
PRESSURE SYSTEMS...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS REVEAL WEST SOUTHWEST 
WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS...WITH LOCAL RADARS ONLY DETECTING AN EXITING 
CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE DISTANT WATERS 
SOUTHEAST OF THE UPPER KEYS. OTHERWISE...OUR MORNING SOUNDING SHOWS 
A PRONOUNCED DRY LAYER (PWAT 1.39 INCHES) BETWEEN 950 AND 850 
MB...WITH LIGHT SOUTHWEST WINDS GRADUALLY VEERING TO WESTERLY ABOVE 
500 MB. DESPITE A FAVORABLE VEERING LOW LEVEL FLOW...SHEAR AND DRY 
AIR MAY POSE A CHALLENGE FOR CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT. 
  
.FORECAST...
THE AFOREMENTIONED (1ST PARAGRAPH) MID AND UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE 
WILL PASS THROUGH OUR REGION BY AFTERNOON...WITH DRIER AIR TO 
FOLLOW. FURTHERMORE...THE MORNING SOUNDING SUPPORTS GFS FORECAST 
SOUNDING TODAY WITH THE DISTINCT DRY LAYER BETWEEN 950 AND 850 MB. 
DESPITE A FAVORABLE VEERING LOW LEVEL FLOW...SHEAR AND DRY AIR MAY 
POSE A CHALLENGE FOR CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT...BUT A FEW SHOWERS AND 
PERHAPS A THUNDERSTORM CAN NOT BE RULED OUT. HENCE...HAVE ALREADY 
UPDATED THE PUBLIC ZONE FORECAST TO LOWER POPS AND REDUCE CLOUD 
COVER.

WINDS OF 5 KNOTS RESPECTIVELY. WITH THE WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE 
HOLDING ACROSS THE ISLAND OF CUBA AND THE THERMAL TROUGH DEVELOPING 
OVER THE MAINLAND...A SUBTLE TIGHTENING OF THE PRESSURE GRADIENT 
SHOULD RESULT IN WEST WINDS OF AROUND 10 KNOTS. OTHERWISE...DUE TO 
THE DRIER AIR WORKING IN FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO...HAVE REDUCE

415 AM EDT SUN JUN 4 2006

DECIDED TO MAINTAIN 40 PCT POPS FOR TODAY

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK SURFACE RIDGE AXIS IS ANALYZED EXTENDING WSW OVER THE CENTRAL 
BAHAMAS...OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA...TO THE NW COAST OF CUBA.
A NEARLY STATIONARY SURFACE TROUGH LIES ALONG THE SOUTH CAROLINA 
COAST TO NORTH FLORIDA. BETWEEN THESE TWO FEATURES...LIGHT SW TO W 
WINDS ARE BLOWING OVER THE KEYS...WITH SPEEDS RANGING  4-11 KT THE 
PAST HOUR. A LARGE DEEP LAYERED LOW PRESSURE CENTER CONTINUES TO 
WRAP UP OVER THE NE U.S. WITH AN ASSOCIATED LONG WAVE TROUGH ALOFT 
EXTENDING SOUTH TO FLORIDA. SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGERY DEPICTS AN 
UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH SWINGING SE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE 
LONG WAVE TROUGH...COMING IN TOWARD CENTRAL AND SOUTH FLORIDA FROM 
THE NW. IR SATELLITE SHOWS A FIELD OF MID AND HIGH CLOUDS INCREASING 
OVER THE SE GULF IN ADVANCE OF THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH. 
INTERESTINGLY...A COUPLE OF ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE POPPED UP IN 
THE GULF RIGHT UNDER THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS WHERE DEEPER 
MOISTURE TO THE SE IS ADJACENT TO DRYING ALOFT BEHIND THE TROUGH 
AXIS. THIS MAY BE REFLECTIVE OF THE EXPECTED INTENSIFYING OF HIGH 
LEVEL WINDS (300-200 MB) AND DIVERGENCE OVER THE REGION. MEANWHILE...
KEY WEST, MIAMI, AND TAMPA DOPPLER RADARS ARE SHOWING SOME NEWLY 
DEVELOPED LIGHT RAIN PATCHES COMING OUT OF THICKENING MID CLOUDS 
OVER GULF WATERS BETWEEN NAPLES AND FT. MYERS...WHILE ON THE OUTER 
FRINGES THE RADARS SUGGEST SOME SHOWERS WELL OUT IN THE SE GULF. 
  
.FORECAST...

TODAY...THE NAM MODEL CONTINUES TO SHOW QUITE STRONG DEEP LAYER LIFT 
SETTING IN OVER THE KEYS DUE TO ONSET OF HIGH LEVEL DIVERGENCE OVER 
THE AREA. 250 MB WINDS ARE FORECAST TO GO FROM 30 KT OVER THE KEYS...
TO 75 KT OR SO BY END OF THE DAY TODAY...WHILE AT MID LEVELS (500 
MB) THE SHORT WAVE AXIS PASSES OVER DURING THE DAY. THE NAM PROMOTES 
DEEP MOISTURE AS WELL. IN CONTRAST THE GFS MODEL HAS MOST LIFT 
SETTING IN EAST OF THE KEYS. RATHER THAN ACCEPT THE VERY HIGH POPS 
GIVEN BY NAM MODEL OUTPUT (80-90 PCT)...I WILL MAINTAIN ONGOING 40 
PCT POPS (WHICH ALSO IS TODAYS GFS MOS POP)...STAYING WITH CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS AND SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. MODELS AGREE THAT 
WINDS MAY GO MORE SW OVER THE KEYS...PERHAPS CLOSER TO W FOR GULF 
WATERS...AT SPEEDS 10 MPH OR LESS AWAY FROM ANY CONVECTION. 

TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AFTER PASSAGE OF THE MID LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE TROUGH...DRY AIR ALOFT IS EXPECTED TO OVERSPREAD THE KEYS AT 
LEVELS MAINLY ABOVE 10-12 THSD FT AGL...WHILE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
REMAINS PLENTIFUL. WEAK SURFACE WIND FLOW...MESOSCALE BOUNDARIES...
AND DAILY HEATING OF ISLAND LAND MASSES MAY PROVIDE THE MAIN SPARKS 
FOR SETTING OFF SHOWERS...ALTHOUGH BOTH MODELS STILL INDICATE SOME
SLIGHT LOWER LEVEL LIFT. 30 PCT POPS WILL BE RETAINED. A WEAK 
SURFACE WIND FLOW MAY GO VARIABLE OR BE A LIGHT W TO SW. 

TUESDAY-TUESDAY NIGHT...BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS SHOW DRY AIR 
ALOFT WORKING DOWNWARD FOR A BRIEF SPELL...INTO LEVELS BELOW 5 THSD 
FT AGL. SURFACE WIND FLOW IS DIFFICULT TO GAUGE DUE TO WEAKNESS OF 
THE PATTERN AND POSSIBILITY OF A MINOR SURFACE TROUGH ROTATING EAST 
OF THE KEYS. THIS PERIOD MAY WARRANT LOWER POPS...BUT I WILL LEAVE 
AT 30 PCT FOR NOW TO ASSESS LATER MODEL INDICATIONS OF THE LOWERING 
DRY AIR. MODELS STILL INDICATE CARIBBEAN MOISTURE AND/OR SOME FORM 
OF TROUGHINESS AFFECTING AREAS OVER EASTERN CUBA AND THE BAHAMAS.

WEDNESDAY-SATURDAY...THE EXTENDED GFS IS QUITE MUDDLED THROUGH THIS 
PERIOD. THE DEEP MOISTURE AND TROUGH TO OUR E AND SE...IS GRADUALLY 
NUDGED NW TO THE KEYS WHILE WEAK LOW PRESSURE RIPPLES FORM AND RIDE 
NE OVER THE AREA ALONG THE VAGUE TROUGH AXIS. GFS RUN-TO-RUN DETAILS 
REMAIN TOO INCONSISTENT FOR ANY CONFIDENCE AT THIS TIME. 
&&

.MARINE...
AN OVERALL WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN SHOULD BE OVER THE KEYS THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS...WITH A MAINLY SW TO W FLOW 5-10 KT TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...GOING MORE VARIABLE MON AND MON NIGHT. TUE AND WED REMAIN 
UNCERTAIN AS TO WIND DIRECTION...BUT WINDS MAY GO MORE NORTHERLY IF 
A WEAK TROUGH SETS UP TO OUR EAST. WATCH OF LIGHTNING AND MAYBE A 
FEW WATERSPOUTS AGAIN. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS THIS MORNING. ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL PRODUCE

.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE WEST TO 
NORTHWEST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE WEST TO 
NORTHWEST NEAR 10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. ONLY 
ABOUT FOUR DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT DUE TO GENTLE 
WEST TO NORTHWEST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 
MID 80S. 
  
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT)...
IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS CENTRAL FLORIDA TONIGHT. IN THE UPPER 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO 
THE SERVICE AREA TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE...
BUT RELATIVELY DRY FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER 
(PWAT) VALUE JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE HALF OF AN INCH. ATMOSPHERIC 
MOISTURE COULD INCREASE TONIGHT. BE THAT AS IT MAY...PWAT VALUES 
SHOULD REMAIN BELOW ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH TONIGHT. THE 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE MOVING INTO THE SERVICE AREA 
TONIGHT MAY PROVIDE ENOUGH UPPER LEVEL DYMANICS TO SUPPORT LOW 
CHANCE POPS...MAINLY AFTER 400 AM. THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS FOR 
THE FLORIDA KEYS HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...SO NO UPDATES ARE 
EXPECTED.

.CURRENTLY...
SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES A WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE REACHING

INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. BECAUSE OF THE ORIENTATION OF THESE 
PRESSURE SYSTEMS...C-MAN STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS DEPICT 
SOUTHWEST TO WEST WINDS NEAR 5 KNOTS...WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE 
DETECTING ONLY A FEW SHOWERS IN OUR REGION. MEANWHILE...GOES-12 
WATER VAPOR SHOWS A DISTINCT MID AND UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE MOVING 
EASTWARD ACROSS THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE YUCATAN PENINSULA...WITH 
ANOTHER MORE VIGOROUS DISTURBANCE DROPPING SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE

CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE (PWAT 1.79 INCHES) WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLY 
AIRMASS WITHIN A FAIRLY UNIDIRECTIONAL SOUTHWEST FLOW. 
  
.FORECAST...
GIVEN AMPLE MOISTURE IN PLACE...A FAVORABLE SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL 
ALLOW CLOUD LINES TO GENERATE NEAR THE ISLAND CHAIN AND SURROUNDING 
WATERS. ENOUGH INSOLATION COMBINED WITH WEAK LARGE SCALE ASCENT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED (1ST PARAGRAPH) MID AND UPPER

FORECAST ELEMENTS AND THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK INCLUDES 
POSSIBLE WATERSPOUTS...NO ADJUSTMENTS APPEAR NECESSARY.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A BROAD SURFACE LOW PRESSURE TROUGH HAS MOVED INTO SOUTH GEORGIA AND 
NORTH FLORIDA...AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS HAS 
ALSO SHIFTED SOUTH TO THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA OR 
NEAR THE UPPER KEYS. THE OVERALL WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN MAY HAVE 
ANOTHER WEAK TROUGH SUPERIMPOSED ON IT...RUNNING SOUTH ALONG OR NEAR 
THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA TO THE LOWER KEYS...WHICH HAS TURNED WINDS 
TO W OR WNW BEHIND IT IN THOSE WATERS. WIND SPEEDS ARE LIGHT ALL 
OVER THE KEYS...UNDER 10 KT. SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGES SHOW A 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH ALOFT...EXITING THE YUCATAN PENINSULA AND MOVING 
EAST INTO THE SE GULF OF MEXICO AND EXTREME NW CARIBBEAN...WITH A 
PRECEDING LIFT REGION PRODUCING A HUMP OF CIRRUS WHICH IS MOVING 
ONTO THE KEYS AT THIS TIME. SINCE MIDNIGHT...SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN SHORT LINES FORMED OVER GULF WATERS WEST AND NORTH 
OF THE LOWER KEYS...BUT THESE HAVE SINCE WANED. MEANWHILE...OTHER 
ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE FORMING SW OF THE LOWER KEYS...AND OVER FLORIDA 
BAY. LOOKING FARTHER UPSTREAM...ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROUGH ALOFT IS 
SEEN IN SATELLITE IMAGES MOVING SSE INTO THE NORTHWEST GULF OF 
MEXICO. 
  
.FORECAST...
NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS IN THIS FORECAST 
PACKAGE. THE PASSAGE OF UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGHS FROM THE WEST 
OVER THE KEYS TODAY...AND AGAIN SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY EVENING MAY 
SOMEWHAT AID DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA.

TODAY-TONIGHT...THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH AXIS NOW MOVING EAST FROM 
YUCATAN IS FORECAST BY ALL MODELS TO RIPPLE ENE OVER THE KEYS BY END 
OF TODAY...AND THIS MAY PROVIDE SOME SLIGHT MID LEVEL LIFT TO AID 
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT DURING THE DAY. MODELS DO NOT PROMOTE STRONG 
UPWARD VERTICAL VELOCITIES HOWEVER. A LIGHT SW TO W LOW LEVEL WIND 
FLOW...AND PLENTIFUL MOISTURE BELOW 10 THSD FT (700 MB) ALSO MAY 
PROVIDE FOR TCU/CB FORMATION IN CLOUD LINES NEAR THE ISLANDS WITH 
THE HEAT OF DAY. ALL MODELS PRODUCE 30 PCT POPS FOR TODAY AND 20-30 
PCT FOR TONIGHT.  

SUNDAY-SUNDAY NIGHT...MODELS AGREE WITH A WEAK SURFACE PRESSURE 
PATTERN GIVING GENERALLY SOUTHWEST TO WEST LOW LEVEL FLOW. AT 500 
MB...THAT SECOND SHORT WAVE TROUGH NOW MOVING INTO THE NW GULF OF 
MEXICO IS FORECAST TO SWING EAST AND MOVE QUICKLY TO THE KEYS BY 
LATE SUNDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT...PERHAPS AGAIN ENHANCING LOCAL MID 
LEVEL LIFT BUT MODELS DO NOT PROMOTE STRONG UVVS. 
SIMULTANEOUSLY...MODELS CONTINUE TO FORECAST DEVELOPMENT OF A LARGE 
COLD CORE UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE OVER THE NE UNITED STATES WITH AN 
ATTENDANT LONG WAVE TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTH TO FLORIDA. STRONG WIND 
SPEEDS AT 250 MB (NEAR 100 KT) ARE FORECAST TO COME INTO EXISTENCE 
LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY OVER THE SE GULF TO SOUTH FLORIDA. BOTH GFS 
AND NAM MODELS INDICATE HIGHER POPS FOR SUNDAY (60 PCT AND 50 
PCT)...AND FOR NOW I WILL MAINTAIN ONGOING 30 PCT POPS BUT THESE MAY 
NEED RAISING. 

MONDAY-TUESDAY...AS IN PAST MODEL RUNS...THE GFS CONTINUES TO FORM 
LOW PRESSURE OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN AND BRING IT OVER CENTRAL CUBA 
INTO THE BAHAMAS DURING THIS TIME FRAME. THE NAM MODEL MAINTAINS 
WEAKEN LOWER PRESSURE IN THE NW CARIBBEAN WITH A WEAK TROUGH TO THE 
BAHAMAS. THE EUROPEAN AND UKMET MODELS SHOW LITTLE OF THIS TYPE 
PATTERN. THE NAVY NOGAPS KEEPS WEAK LOW PRESSURE IN THE NW CARIBBEAN 
WITH A TROUGH TO THE BAHAMAS. I WILL INDICATE A WIND FLOW SIMILAR TO 
NAVY NOGAPS IN THIS TIME FRAME...WITH SPEEDS 10 KT OR LESS. UPPER 
LEVEL SUPPORT FOR SHOWERS MAY LESSEN...BUT MOISTURE WILL REMAIN IN 
LOWER LEVELS...AND STEERING FLOW MAY COME OFF THE MAINLAND TUESDAY. 
30 PCT POPS WILL KEEP GOING IN THE FORECAST. 

WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY...EXTENDED GFS INDICATES A TURN OF DEEP LAYER FLOW 
TO NE THEN E...AT LIGHT TO MODERATE SPEEDS...AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES 
OVER NORTH FLORIDA. DRY AIR IS SEEN ABOVE 10 THSD FT...AND NOT MUCH 
IN THE WAY OF SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT IS SEEN. 20 OR 30 PCT POPS SEEN IN 
ORDER.

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...CORRECTION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
415 AM EDT SAT JUN 3 2006

CORRECTED FOR A TYPO

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A BROAD SURFACE LOW PRESSURE TROUGH HAS MOVED INTO SOUTH GEORGIA AND 
NORTH FLORIDA...AND SUBSEQUENTLY THE WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS HAS 
ALSO SHIFTED SOUTH TO THE SOUTHERN TIP OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA OR 
NEAR THE UPPER KEYS. THE OVERALL WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN MAY HAVE 
ANOTHER WEAK TROUGH SUPERIMPOSED ON IT...RUNNING SOUTH ALONG OR NEAR 
THE WEST COAST OF FLORIDA TO THE LOWER KEYS...WHICH HAS TURNED WINDS 
TO W OR WNW BEHIND IT IN THOSE WATERS. WIND SPEEDS ARE LIGHT ALL 
OVER THE KEYS...UNDER 10 KT. SATELLITE WATER VAPOR IMAGES SHOW A 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH ALOFT...EXITING THE YUCATAN PENINSULA AND MOVING 
EAST INTO THE SE GULF OF MEXICO AND EXTREME NW CARIBBEAN...WITH A 
PRECEDING LIFT REGION PRODUCING A HUMP OF CIRRUS WHICH IS MOVING 
ONTO THE KEYS AT THIS TIME. SINCE MIDNIGHT...SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN SHORT LINES FORMED OVER GULF WATERS WEST AND NORTH 
OF THE LOWER KEYS...BUT THESE HAVE SINCE WANED. MEANWHILE...OTHER 
ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE FORMING SW OF THE LOWER KEYS...AND OVER FLORIDA 
BAY. LOOKING FARTHER UPSTREAM...ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROUGH ALOFT IS 
SEEN IN SATELLITE IMAGES MOVING SSE INTO THE NORTHWEST GULF OF 
MEXICO. 
  
.FORECAST...
NO CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO ONGOING FORECASTS IN THIS FORECAST 
PACKAGE. THE PASSAGE OF UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGHS FROM THE WEST 
OVER THE KEYS TODAY...AND AGAIN SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY EVENING MAY 
SOMEWHAT AID DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA.

TODAY-TONIGHT...THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH AXIS NOW MOVING EAST FROM 
YUCATAN IS FORECAST BY ALL MODELS TO RIPPLE ENE OVER THE KEYS BY END 
OF TODAY...AND THIS MAY PROVIDE SOME SLIGHT MID LEVEL LIFT TO AID 
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT DURING THE DAY. MODELS DO NOT PROMOTE STRONG 
UPWARD VERTICAL VELOCITIES HOWEVER. A LIGHT SW TO W LOW LEVEL WIND 
FLOW...AND PLENTIFUL MOISTURE BELOW 10 THSD FT (700 MB) ALSO MAY 
PROVIDE FOR TCU/CB FORMATION IN CLOUD LINES NEAR THE ISLANDS WITH 
THE HEAT OF DAY. ALL MODELS PRODUCE 30 PCT POPS FOR TODAY AND 20-30 
PCT FOR TONIGHT.  

SUNDAY-SUNDAY NIGHT...MODELS AGREE WITH A WEAK SURFACE PRESSURE 
PATTERN GIVING GENERALLY SOUTHWEST TO WEST LOW LEVEL FLOW. AT 500 
MB...THAT SECOND SHORT WAVE TROUGH NOW MOVING INTO THE NW GULF OF 
MEXICO IS FORECAST TO SWING EAST AND MOVE QUICKLY TO THE KEYS BY 
LATE SUNDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT...PERHAPS AGAIN ENHANCING LOCAL MID 
LEVEL LIFT BUT MODELS DO NOT PROMOTE STRONG UVVS. 
SIMULTANEOUSLY...MODELS CONTINUE TO FORECAST DEVELOPMENT OF A LARGE 
COLD CORE UPPER LEVEL CYCLONE OVER THE NE UNITED STATES WITH AN 
ATTENDANT LONG WAVE TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTH TO FLORIDA. STRONG WIND 
SPEEDS AT 250 MB (NEAR 100 KT) ARE FORECAST TO COME INTO EXISTENCE 
LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT OVER THE SE GULF TO SOUTH FLORIDA. BOTH 
GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATE HIGHER POPS FOR SUNDAY (60 PCT AND 50 
PCT)...AND FOR NOW I WILL MAINTAIN ONGOING 30 PCT POPS BUT THESE MAY 
NEED RAISING. 

MONDAY-TUESDAY...AS IN PAST MODEL RUNS...THE GFS CONTINUES TO FORM 
LOW PRESSURE OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN AND BRING IT OVER CENTRAL CUBA 
INTO THE BAHAMAS DURING THIS TIME FRAME. THE NAM MODEL MAINTAINS 
WEAKER LOWER PRESSURE IN THE NW CARIBBEAN WITH A WEAK TROUGH TO THE 
BAHAMAS. THE EUROPEAN AND UKMET MODELS SHOW LITTLE OF THIS TYPE 
PATTERN. THE NAVY NOGAPS KEEPS WEAK LOW PRESSURE IN THE NW CARIBBEAN 
WITH A TROUGH TO THE BAHAMAS. I WILL INDICATE A WIND FLOW SIMILAR TO 
NAVY NOGAPS IN THIS TIME FRAME...WITH SPEEDS 10 KT OR LESS. UPPER 
LEVEL SUPPORT FOR SHOWERS MAY LESSEN...BUT MOISTURE WILL REMAIN 
ABUNDANT IN LOWER LEVELS...AND STEERING FLOW MAY COME OFF THE 
MAINLAND TUESDAY. 30 PCT POPS WILL KEEP GOING IN THE FORECAST. 

WEDNESDAY-FRIDAY...EXTENDED GFS INDICATES A TURN OF DEEP LAYER FLOW 
TO NE THEN E...AT LIGHT TO MODERATE SPEEDS...AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES 
OVER NORTH FLORIDA. DRY AIR IS SEEN ABOVE 10 THSD FT...AND NOT MUCH 
IN THE WAY OF SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT IS SEEN. 20 OR 30 PCT POPS SEEM IN 
ORDER. 
&&

.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN MAY TURN WINDS TO NW FOR A WHILE OVER LOWER 
KEYS AND GULF WATERS TODAY...BUT ON THE WHOLE SW TO W WINDS 5-10 KT 
OUGHT TO PREVAIL OVER THE KEYS ON THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THERE STILL 
IS BIG UNCERTAINTY OVER WIND DIRECTION COME MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES IN THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES 
OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE SOUTH 
TO SOUTHWEST NEAR 5 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE SOUTH NEAR 5 
KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. ONLY ABOUT THREE DEGREES 
OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO LIGHT SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST 
SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S. 
  
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT)...
A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE OVER THE PANHANDLE OF FLORIDA 
TONIGHT. CLOSER TO THE FLORIDA KEYS...THE WESTERN EXTENT OF AN 
ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE FLORIDA 
STRAITS TONIGHT. THE 00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE...WITH A 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE OF JUST UNDER ONE AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN 
INCH. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN CONSTANT TONIGHT. THE 00Z 
KEY WEST SOUNDING ALSO INDICATES LIGHT SOUTH WINDS OF 5 KNOTS OR 
LESS FROM THE SURFACE TO 850MB. THERE ARE NO DETECTABLE OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES SOUTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS. ANY UNDETECTABLE OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES WILL HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING IT TO THE FLORIDA KEYS GIVEN 
THE LIGHT SOUTH WIND FIELD IN PLACE. LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFT 
COUPLED WITH LITTLE TO NO MESOSCALE FORCING ONLY SUPPORTS A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF RAINFALL FOR TONIGHT. THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE 
FLORIDA KEYS WILL BE UPDATED TO DECREASE POPS FROM LOW CHANCE 
CATEGORY TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY FOR TONIGHT.  

&&

.MARINE...
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS OF 10 KNOTS OR LESS WILL PREVAIL ON ALL 
KEYS WATERS TONIGHT. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST WEDNESDAY.

&&

.AVIATION...
ONLY A FEW MVFR SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO AFFECT THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST 
FLIGHT ROUTE OVERNIGHT. ISOLATED MVFR BR MAY DEVELOP IN THE PREDAWN 
HOURS OVER INTERIOR SOUTH FLORIDA. OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS ARE 
ANTICIPATED. SURFACE WINDS AWAY FROM DEVELOPING LAND BREEZES WILL 
GENERALLY BE VERY LIGHT SOUTH SOUTHEASTERLY...BECOMING SOUTHWESTERLY

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE SUNNY TODAY IN OUR ISLAND REALM WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 
UPPER 80S AND LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS. SATELLITE SHOWED A CLOUD LINE 
IN THE LOWER KEYS WITHIN WHICH OUR RADAR DETECTED A FEW ECHOES. 
MOVEMENT WAS ERRATIC.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
LARGE-SCALE FORCING WAS WEAK OR ABSENT SO WE LOOKED FOR EFFECTS AT 
THE LOCAL AND REGIONAL SCALES. A GOOD EXAMPLE WAS OUR WINDS. WINDS 
WERE VARIABLE THIS MORNING AND SETTLED INTO THE SOUTHEAST ONLY AFTER 
MAINLAND HEATING HAD PROGRESSED SUFFICIENTLY TO SET UP THE SEA 
BREEZES. WE CAN EXPECT A RETURN TO VARIABLE WINDS AFTER SUNSET.
&&

.FORECASTS...
WE HAVE MADE NO CHANGES TO OUR GOING FORECASTS IN THE FIRST FEW 
PERIODS. THAT IS WE ARE RELYING ON CONTINUITY AND CLIMATOLOGY HERE 
WHICH ARGUE FOR MORE OF THE SAME. 

FOR MONDAY AND BEYOND WE HAVE TAKEN COGNIZANCE OF THE AVAILABLE 
GUIDANCE INSOFAR AS IT SEEMS REASONABLE. THAT MEANS WE HAVE 
MAINTAINED GENERALLY WESTERLY SHEAR IN OUR GRIDS AND TEXT AND 
REJECTED...FOR NOW...THE GFS SOLUTION OF A HYBRID LOW OVER CENTRAL 
CUBA HEADED TOWARD THE BAHAMAS.  
&&

.MARINE...
SAILORS CAN USE THIS TIME FOR DOCKSIDE MAINTENANCE. FOR POWER 
BOATERS VERY GOOD BOATING CONDITIONS WILL EXIST THROUGH SUNDAY. 
LIGHT WINDS SHOULD PREVAIL WITH VERY LITTLE SEA AND JUST ISOLATED 
SHOWERS.
&&

.AVIATION...
OUTSIDE OF A VICINITY SHOWER AND BRIEF IFR/MVFR SPELL AT BOTH THE 
MARATHON AND KEY WEST TERMINALS...VFR CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED. 
OTHERWISE...LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS SHOULD PREDOMINATE. FOR THE 
ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE ANTICIPATED...EXCEPT ON THE MAINLAND WHERE WIDELY 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD PREVAIL THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE 
BECOMING ISOLATED LATE THIS EVENING.

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
SKIES WERE PARTLY CLOUDY THIS MORNING IN THE KEYS WITH TEMPERATURES 
IN THE LOWER 80S AND LIGHT/VARIABLE WINDS. SATELLITE SHOWED CLOUDS 
IN THE MIDDLE KEYS AND OUR RADAR DETECTED A FEW SHOWERS NEAR PIGEON 
KEY. MOVEMENT WAS ERRATIC.

OUR MORNING SOUNDING HAD DRIED SLIGHTLY FROM 24 HOURS AGO WITH TOTAL 
COLUMN MOISTURE 1.4 INCHES. WINDS WERE NEAR-CALM BELOW 850 MB WITH 
LIGHT SOUTHWESTERLIES ABOVE. LESS THAN 20 KTS OF SHEAR EXISTED 
THROUGH 40 KFT. 

A PROBLEM WITH GATEWAY INTERRUPTED THE FLOW OF DATA THROUGH THE 
SYSTEM LAST NIGHT. GRADUALLY THIS IS BEING RESTORED.
&&

.ANALYSIS...
WITH PLENTY OF INSTABILITY AND SO LITTLE SHEAR THIS COULD BE A GOOD 
DAY FOR ISLAND CLOUD LINES AND WATERSPOUTS. PULSE MODE SEEMS 
APPROPRIATE -- A MORNING PULSE AND A SECOND PULSE LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE MAINLAND WILL BE INTERESTING TODAY.
&&

.FORECASTS...
OUR GOING FORECASTS LOOK GOOD AND WE PLAN NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. WE 
WILL REMOVE SOME TRANSITIONAL WORDING AND MAINTAIN OUR WEATHER 
WATCH.
&&

.MARINE...
IF YOU ARE PLANNING A SAIL TODAY THEN PLAN ON MOTORING. OTHERWISE 
VERY GOOD BOATING CONDITIONS WILL EXIST TODAY. IF YOU ARE IN FLORIDA 
BAY THIS AFTERNOON KEEP AN EYE ON THE MAINLAND. WHEN YOU HEAR 
THUNDER YOU HAVE ABOUT AN HOUR BEFORE THE WIND ARRIVES. IF YOU ARE 
NEAR THE LOWER KEYS KEEP AN EYE FOR WATERSPOUTS.
&&

.AVIATION...
CLOUD LINES SHOULD FORM NEAR THE ISLAND CHAIN...WITH VICINITY 
SHOWERS AT THE MARATHON AND ESPECIALLY AT THE KEY WEST TERMINAL. 
OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL FOR THE MOST PART WITH 
LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS OF LESS THAN 10 KNOTS. ON THE 
MAINLAND...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE 
EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A SLOW DRIFT TO THE NORTHEAST.

THE MAIN ATLANTIC SURFACE RIDGE AXIS IS ANALYZED WELL NORTH OF THE 
KEYS...WHERE IT IS WEAK AND EXTENDS WEST TO NORTH FLORIDA. MEANWHILE 
A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH ORIENTED SSE-NNW LIES OVER THE EASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...SEPARATING THE WEAK ATLANTIC RIDGE FLOW FROM AN EQUALLY 
WEAK GULF RIDGE AXIS COVERING THE WEST AND CENTRAL GULF. AS A 
RESULT...KEYS AREA WINDS HAVE REMAINED FROM THE SSE OVERNIGHT...
NEAR 10 KT AT LATEST C-MAN OBSERVATIONS. ALL OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN 
MISSING SINCE 11 PM LAST NIGHT...BUT SOME MIDNIGHT OBS HAVE JUST 
COME IN. NO RECENT SHIP REPORTS ARE AVAILABLE YET. RADAR HAS 
DETECTED CONTINUED SHOWER AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT 
OVERNIGHT OVER GULF WATERS N AND NW OF THE LOWER KEYS...WHERE SOME 
BOUNDARIES BLOWING OFF THE LOWER KEYS PERHAPS HAVE FOCUSED THIS 
DEVELOPMENT. ISOLATED SHOWERS LIKEWISE HAVE DOTTED ATLANTIC-SIDE 
WATERS ON SMALL BOUNDARIES MIGRATING NORTH FROM CUBA. 

.FORECASTS...
MARINE OBSERVATIONS ARE STILL LAGGING SEVERAL HOURS BEHIND DUE TO 
COMMS PROBLEMS...WHILE GFS MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS AND EUROPEAN 
MODEL GRAPHICS ARRIVED A FEW MINUTES AGO. IN THE NEARER TERMS...
MODEL DATA IS SIMILAR TO RECENT PAST RUNS SO NO CHANGES ARE MADE TO 
THE NEARER TERM DUE TO SIMILAR FORECAST REASONING. IN THE 
INTERMEDIATE PERIODS APPROXIMATELY MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THE GFS 
MODEL CONTINUES TO DEVELOP A CLOSED LOW OVER THE NW CARIBBEAN AND 
BRING IT OVER CENTRAL CUBA INTO THE BAHAMAS...AND THIS WILL BE 
FILTERED OUT OF FORECASTS FOR NOW. WIND FORECASTS FOR THIS TIME 
FRAME ARE QUITE UNCERTAIN. SEE DISCUSSION FOR THIS PERIOD BELOW AND 
MARINE SECTION AS WELL.  A WEAK RIDGE IS SHOWN IN LATER PERIODS FROM 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY TO RETURN TO AREAS JUST NORTH OF...OR 
NEAR...THE KEYS. 

TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...A SERIES OF WEAK ILL-DEFINED SHORT 
WAVE TROUGHS ALOFT (500 MB) ARE INDICATED IN MODELS TO RIPPLE EAST 
OR SOUTHEAST OVER THE KEYS. THE MAIN LARGE SCALE LIFT AT MID TO HIGH 
LEVELS IS INDICATED BY MOST MODELS TO AFFECT AREAS SOUTHEAST AND 
EAST OF THE KEYS DURING THIS PERIOD...HOWEVER GFS AND NAM MODELS DO 
SHOW LIFT AREAS PASSING OVER THE KEYS SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT. MEANWHILE...MOISTURE IS EXPECTED TO BE LIMITED TO LEVELS 
BELOW 10 THSD FT AGL (BELOW 700 MB) TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH A 
BIT DEEPER LEVEL OF MOISTURE SAT NIGHT AND SUN. NONETHELESS...GIVEN 
SUFFICIENT HEATING OF ISLANDS...LIGHT LOW LEVEL WIND FLOW EVEN IF IT 
IS NOT IDEAL FOR ISLAND HEAT CHANNELS...AND SUFFICIENT MOISTURE IN 
THE SURFACE TO 10 THSD FT AGL LEVEL...THEN SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE PERIOD AT LEAST DUE TO 
DIURNAL EFFECTS AS WELL AS FOCUS OF MESOSCALE (OUTFLOW) BOUNDARIES. 
I WONT STRAY FROM CURRENTLY FORECASTED 30 PCT CHANCES OF RAIN FOR 
EACH 12 HOUR PERIOD. 

MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...THE GFS MAINTAINS DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW 
PRESSURE CENTER OVER THE CARIBBEAN...MOVING IT OVER CENTRAL CUBA TO 
THE BAHAMAS. UPPER LEVEL WINDS ARE SHOWN BY MODELS TO BE GENERALLY 
WESTERLY OVER FLORIDA AND THE NW CARIBBEAN DURING THIS TIME FRAME...
WITH PASSING SHORT WAVE TROUGHS ALOFT. GFS DEVELOPMENT SEEMS 
OVERDONE. NAVY NOGAPS THROUGH 120 HOURS...AND NAM OUT TO 84 HOURS...
SUGGEST A SURFACE TROUGH IN THE SAME AREA...NW CARIBBEAN-CENTRAL 
CUBA-CENTRAL BAHAMAS WHICH MAY BE MORE REASONABLE AT THIS TIME. 
THE LATEST JUST-IN EUROPEAN MODEL HAS NO SEMBLANCE OF A TROUGH SE OR 
E OF THE KEYS...MAINTAINING A LIGHT SE TO S WIND FLOW OVER THE KEYS. 
GIVEN THIS UNCERTAINTY...I WILL KEEP CURRENTLY FORECASTED WINDS IN 
THE GRIDS AND IN MARINE FORECASTS AS IS...BUT IF THE EUROPEAN MODEL 
IS MORE CORRECT THESE WINDS MAY BE 180 DEGREES OUT. AT LEAST MODELS 
HAVE INDICATIONS OF ONLY ABOUT 10 KT OR SO WIND SPEEDS. 

TUESDAY NIGHT-THURSDAY...NO CHANGE TO ONGOING FORECASTS IS INDICATED 
IN THIS PERIOD DUE TO TYPICAL LONGER-RANGE UNCERTAINTY...ALTHOUGH 
THE GFS MODEL SUGGESTS SOME DRYING AT LOWER LEVELS WHICH IF TRUE 
WOULD SIGNAL LOWER CHANCES OF RAIN. 
&&

.MARINE...
A SE TO S WIND FLOW NEAR 10 KT IS EXPECTED TO SLACKEN TO 5-10 KT 
THIS AFTERNOON...AND DIRECTIONS MAY TEND TO EITHER STAY CLOSE TO S 
OR GO VARIABLE. A LIGHT PRESSURE PATTERN WILL KEEP WIND SPEEDS 5-10 
KT TONIGHT. AS A TROUGH SINKS SOUTH INTO NORTH FLORIDA...THE WEAK 
ATLANTIC RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT SOUTH OF THE KEYS...TURNING 
LOCAL WINDS TO SW THEN W SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. MONDAY AND TUESDAY 
WIND DIRECTIONS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN...BUT SPEEDS SHOULD STAY 10 KT

.DISCUSSION...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(700 TO 200 MB)...AS OF 
900 PM EDT...A FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN CONTINUES ON THIS LATE 
SPRING EVENING. A LARGE MID AND UPPER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM REMAINS 
CENTERED IN THE WESTERN ATLANTIC ABOUT 250 MILES SOUTHEAST OF 
HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA. TO THE WEST OF THIS FEATURE...A WEAK 
INVERTED TROUGH IS NEAR THE GULF COAST...AND IS IMMEDIATELY FOLLOWED

.DISCUSSION...
.OBSERVATIONS...
WE RECEIVED A LOT OF SUNSHINE TODAY IN THE KEYS AND TEMPERATURES 
CLIMBED INTO THE UPPER 80S. WE COULD USE A BREEZE BUT WINDS WERE 
VERY LIGHT SOUTHEAST. OUR RADAR SHOWED A FEW SHRA IN THE BAY AND 
WIDELY SCATTERED SHRA AND TSRA ON THE MAINLAND EXHIBITING LITTLE 
MOVEMENT BUT COVERAGE WAS INCREASING AT PRESS TIME. 
&&

.ANALYSIS...
WE ANALYZED A TROF NEARBY THIS MORNING. WITH HEATING THIS HAD 
MIGRATED INLAND. ON MSAS THE BEST CONVERGENCE ZONE RAN FROM TAMPA 
TO IMMOKALEE AND PALM BEACH. WITH THE FLOW SO WEAK AND DIVERGENT 
OVER THE ISLANDS WE HAVE HAD A VERY WEAK CLOUD LINE AND JUST A FEW 
SPOTTY SHOWERS ON THE LARGER ISLANDS IN THE LOWER KEYS. 
&&

.FORECASTS...
THE FINAL CLUE LIES IN DEW POINT TEMPERATURES FALLING TO 70 OR LESS. 
WITH THE HORIZONTAL WIND SO WEAK WE ARE SEEING DOWNWARD MIXING OF 
DRIER AIR FROM ALOFT. ALL THINGS CONSIDERED IT SEEMS SAFE TO DROP 
OUR RAIN CHANCES TO 20 PERCENT TONIGHT...WITH ISOLATED COVERAGE OVER 
THE MARINE ZONES. THE BEST CHANCE WILL BE IN THE UPPER KEYS AND 
FLORIDA BAY IN CLOSEST PROXIMITY TO THE MAINLAND.

FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST PACKAGE WE HAVE RELIED ON CONTINUITY 
CLIMATOLOGY AND THE AVAILABLE GUIDANCE. THE MODELS AMPLIFY THE FLOW 
OVER THE EASTERN STATES WHICH LEADS TO CYCLOGENESIS OVER NORTH 
FLORIDA AND GEORGIA. WE CAN ALREADY SEE THE KERNEL OF THIS SYSTEM 
NEAR BROWNSVILLE TEXAS WHICH LENDS CREDENCE TO THE OUTPUT.

BY SATURDAY THIS NEXT SYSTEM WILL TURN OUR WINDS INTO THE SOUTHWEST 
AND WEST...AND THEN NORTHWEST BY MONDAY. ONCE AGAIN THE FLOW REMAINS 
LIGHT SO IT MAY TAKE SOME TIME...BUT DRYING SEEMS INEVITABLE UNDER 
THIS COMING REGIME. LOOK FOR FORECASTED RAIN CHANCES TO DIMINISH 
AFTER THIS WEEKEND WHEN WE GET A BETTER LOOK AT THINGS. UNTIL THEN 
WE ARE CLOSE TO OUR CLIMO VALUES. 
&&

.MARINE...
EASY DOES IT. WINDS WILL BE VARIABLE IN DIRECTION 10 KNOTS OR LESS 
TONIGHT. THE ONLY DIFFICULTIES WILL BE IN FLORIDA BAY WHERE YOU WILL 
BE VULNERABLE TO BLOW OFF FROM MAINLAND CONVECTION THROUGH ABOUT 
1000 PM. KEEP A WEATHER EYE.
&&

.AVIATION...
FOR THE ROUTE FROM KEY WEST TO BEYOND MIAMI...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND

SKIES WERE PARTLY CLOUDY THIS MORNING IN THE KEYS WITH TEMPERATURES 
IN THE LOWER 80S. LIGHT SOUTHEAST WINDS WERE PRESENT IN THE UPPER 
KEYS WITH NEAR-CALM CONDITIONS IN THE LOWER KEYS. OUR RADAR SHOWED 
ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE STRAITS WITH A GREATER CONCENTRATION OFF THE 
UPPER KEYS. A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS WAS ACTIVE ON THE MAINLAND COAST 
NEAR MIAMI AND FT LAUDERDALE. 

WV SATELLITE SHOWED A TROF ALOFT OFF THE CAROLINAS WITH AN AXIS 
REACHING TOWARD FLORIDAS EAST COAST. QUICK-LOOK VISIBLE SHOWED 
CLEAR SKIES OVER THE EVERGLADES. 

OUR MORNING SOUNDING SHOWED 1.5 INCHES TOTAL COLUMN MOISTURE. 
SOUTHERLIES EXISTED BELOW ABOUT 4 KM WITH NORTHERLIES ABOVE THIS. 
MODIFIED FOR HEATING THERE WAS NO INHIBITION. DUE TO THE SHEAR

JUPITER INLET TO CARYSFORT REEF TO VARADERO CUBA. THIS FEATURE WAS 
ENHANCING CONVERGENCE IN THE METRO REGION AND HELPED SUPPORT THE 
SHOWERS ON-GOING THERE AS WELL AS THE UPPER KEYS. THE LOCAL RIDGE

FARTHER INLAND AS WELL DUE TO HEATING IN ALL THOSE CLEAR SKIES. 
GUIDANCE MAINTAINS THE WEAKLY DIFFLUENT FLOW IN SOUTH FLORIDA AHEAD 
OF THE UPPER TROF AXIS WHICH IS REASONABLE. FOR THESE REGIONS WE CAN

.CURRENTLY...
A BROAD CUT OFF LOW IS CENTERED NEAR BERMUDA. THE KEYS ARE UNDER THE 
EXTREME WESTERN PORTION OF THIS LOWS CIRCULATION. AT THE SURFACE AN 
ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS DOWN THE ATLANTIC COAST AND INTO THE 
SOUTHEAST STATES. A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH IS LOCATED JUST 
WEST OF THE KEYS. WINDS ACROSS MOST ISLAND LOCATIONS ARE SOUTHEAST 
AT 5 TO 10 MPH. SEVERAL WEAK SHOWERS ARE MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS 
KEYS WATERS...FURTHER EAST A FEW THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED ALONG 
CLOUDLINES. ONLY A FEW WEAK SHOWERS HAVE AFFECTED ISLAND LOCATIONS. 

.FORECAST...
THE SURFACE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT WESTWARD AND WEAKEN. AMPLE 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND SLIGHTLY CONFLUENT SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW ON THE 
EASTERN PORTION OF THE WEAKENING SURFACE TROUGH WILL KEEP A CHANCE 
OF RAIN IN THE FORECAST FOR TODAY. PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND WITH 
TEMPS NEAR CLIMATOLOGY IS EXPECTED.

AS THE SURFACE TROUGH CONTINUES TO WEAKEN AND SHIFT FURTHER AWAY 
FROM THE KEYS...THE SURFACE RIDGE AND THE CUT OFF LOW WILL BE THE AS 
THE MAIN SYNOPTIC FEATURES RELEVANT TO KEYS WEATHER THROUGH FRIDAY. 
THE CUT OFF LOW WILL CONTINUE TO MEANDER BEFORE LIFTING 
NORTHEASTWARD FRIDAY NIGHT. THE RIDGE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE KEYS 
UNTIL LATE FRIDAY. ALSO ON FRIDAY A MID LATITUDE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL BE MAKING ITS WAY ACROSS THE CENTRAL STATES. AN ASSOCIATED A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. 
IN RESPONSE THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL SHIFT SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE 
STRAITS. THIS WILL PLACE THE KEYS IN A WEAK PRESSURE AREA. WINDS 
WILL BECOME LIGHT AND VARIABLE ON FRIDAY. WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF 
PRECIP IN DUE TO THE LIGHT WINDS AND HIGH MOISTURE IN THE LOWER 
LEVELS.

THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEEPEN AND BROADEN AND THE SUBTROPICAL 
JET WILL BE LOCATED NEAR THE KEYS BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND. THE 
SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDING FROM THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED LOW SYSTEM 
WILL SHIFT A BIT FURTHER SOUTH...AND WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS WILL 
BECOME MORE DEFINED OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST TO WEST ON SATURDAY. 
THROUGH AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL NEARLY CUT OFF OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES WITH A FAIRLY 
STRONG JET STREAM WRAPPING AROUND ITS SOUTHERN PERIPHERY. WILL KEEP 
A CHANCE OF PRECIP THROUGH THE EXTENDED DUE TO THE POTENTIAL FOR 
CLOUD LINE FORMATION AND THE INCREASING ROLE THE UPPER LEVEL LOW AND 
ASSOCIATED JET WILL HAVE ON KEYS WEATHER. SURFACE WIND DIRECTION 
WILL BE HEAVILY DEPENDENT ON UNCERTAIN RELATIVE EXTENTS AND 
STRENGTHS OF BOTH THE TROUGH TO THE NORTH AND THE RIDGE TO THE EAST. 
GENERALLY WINDS WILL BE VARIABLE OR WESTERLY AND LIGHT THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED.

&&

.MARINE...
THE PRESSURE RIDGE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE KEYS...RESULTING IN EAST 
TO SOUTHEAST WINDS WILL PREVAIL ACROSS KEYS WATERS INTO FRIDAY. A 
SURFACE TROUGH WILL PUSH INTO FLORIDA FRIDAY...AND AS A RESULT THE 
RIDGE AXIS WILL SHIFT SOUTHWARD INTO THE STRAITS...RESULTING IN A 
LIGHT PRESSURE PATTERN BY LATE FRIDAY. THROUGH THE WEEKEND WINDS 
WILL BE LIGHT AND BECOME MAINLY SOUTHWESTERLY.

&&

.AVIATION...
WHILE VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL...THERE WILL BE SHORT BOUTS OF 
MVFR CIGS AND VISIBILITIES IN SHOWERS THIS MORNING. ISOLATED IFR 
VISIBILITIES AND THUNDER COULD OCCUR ESPECIALLY NEAR KEY LARGO THIS 
MORNING. EXPECT THE IFR CONDITIONS TO LAST 15 TO 30 MINUTES WITH 
EACH OF THE HEAVIER SHOWERS. SURFACE WINDS ARE NOW AROUND 140

WIDLY SEPARATED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDER NEAR THE KEYS. ON THE 
MAINLAND CLOSER TO KMIA...A DIFFERENT STORY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS

.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS A LARGE CLUSTER OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE 
OFFSHORE WATERS WEST OF MAINLAND MONROE COUNTY. IN ADDITION...KBYX 
DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER FLORIDA BAY AND THE NEARSHORE WATERS 
SOUTH OF THE MIDDLE KEYS. ELSEWHERE...KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION 
ECHOES IN THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND 
CHAIN ARE VARIABLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE NORTHEAST TO EAST AT 
5 TO 10 MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHEAST TO EAST NEAR 
10 KNOTS. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOWER 80S. ONLY ABOUT THREE 
DEGREES OF COOLING IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO LIGHT NORTHEAST TO 
EAST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 80S. 
  
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT)...
IN THE LOW TO MID LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE IS LOCATED OVER THE BAHAMAS...EXTENDING FROM NORTHEAST TO 
SOUTHWEST...ALONG 30N AND 75W TO ABOUT 25N AND 79W. THIS TROUGH OF 
LOW PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO APPROACH THE EAST COAST OF THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA TONIGHT. IN THE UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A CUT OFF 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED NEAR 30N AND 73W TONIGHT. THE 
00Z KEY WEST SOUNDING IS UNSTABLE...BUT RELATIVELY DRY FOR THIS TIME 
OF YEAR...WITH A PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUE JUST ABOVE ONE AND ONE 
QUARTER OF AN INCH. ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN CONSTANT 
TONIGHT. DESPITE BELOW NORMAL ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE TONIGHT...THE 
APPROACHING TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT TO 
SUPPORT A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF MEASURABLE RAINFALL FOR TONIGHT...
WHICH IS ABOVE ALL NUMERICAL MODEL OUTPUT STATISTICS. THE CURRENT 
ZONE FORECASTS FOR THE FLORIDA KEYS HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...
SO NO UPDATES ARE EXPECTED. 

&&

.MARINE...
NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF AROUND 10 KNOTS SHOULD PREVAIL ON ALL 
KEYS WATERS TONIGHT. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY.

.AVIATION...
OVERNIGHT...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW FLIGHT 
ROUTE AS WELL AS AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. 

ON THE MAINLAND...JUST A FEW SHOWERS WILL BE FOUND...BUT ACTIVITY 
SHOULD END BY LATE. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE NEAR THE EVERGLADES WILL 
ALLOW FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF BR AND LOWER SURFACE VISIBILITY...BUT 
THIS WILL DISAPPEAR AROUND SUNRISE. 

ACROSS THE WATER PORTION OF THE ROUTE INCLUDING THE KEYW AND KMTH 
ISLAND TERMINALS...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FOUND 
ACROSS THE ROUTE...BUT WILL BE CIRCUMNAVIGABLE. BRIEF MVFR/IFR 
CEILINGS ARE POSSIBLE WITHIN THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

TEMPERATURES HAVE RANGED FROM THE MID TO UPPER 80S SO FAR THIS LATE 
MAY AFTERNOON...WITH DEWPOINTS REPORTED FROM THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 
70S. THE KEYS HAVE REMAINED UNDER PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES AS EVIDENT ON SATELLITE IMAGERY. A FEW SHOWERS HAVE RECENTLY 
DEVELOPED OVER PORTIONS OF THE UPPER KEYS...AND OTHER SHOWERS ARE 
ABOUT TO ENTER THE NORTHERN FLORIDA BAY NEAR FLAMINGO FROM THE SOUTH 
FLORIDA MAINLAND. CMAN PLATFORMS AND ASOS STATIONS HAVE BEEN 
REPORTING WINDS BETWEEN NORTH AND EAST AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS.  

.FORECAST...
.TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
A WEAK TROUGH LOCATED EAST OF FLORIDA THIS AFTERNOON WILL MOVE 
SLOWLY WESTWARD AND DISSIPATE THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WEAK RIDGING WILL 
REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE KEYS TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. LIGHT 
MAINLY EAST WINDS WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE PERIOD. AS A RESULT...THE 
BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WILL BE THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF CUMULUS CLOUD LINES...AND BOUNDARY INTERACTIONS WITH 
OUTFLOW FROM SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND AFTERNOON CONVECTION. AT THIS 
TIME...I WILL MAINTAIN A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS 
THROUGH THE PERIOD...WITH TEMPERATURES RANGING FROM THE UPPER 80S TO 
NEAR 90 IN THE DAY AND THE UPPER 70S AT NIGHT. 

.FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
A LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES FRIDAY 
AND REMAIN SITUATED OVER THE COASTAL STATES THROUGH MONDAY. AT THE 
SURFACE...THE ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE AXIS OVER SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE 
KEYS WILL RETREAT SOUTH AND EAST FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY AS A WEAK 
COLD FRONT APPROACHES NORTHERN FLORIDA AND STALLS OUT. THE MODELS 
DIFFER IN THE EXTENDED RANGE (MONDAY AND TUESDAY) FORECAST. THE MOST 
LIKELY SOLUTION BUILDS ANOTHER RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OVER 
SOUTH FLORIDA. PERSISTENCE WILL BE MAINTAINED FOR THE EXTENDED TIME 
PERIOD...WITH NEAR CLIMATOLOGICAL NORMAL RAIN CHANCES AND 
TEMPERATURES.

&&
.MARINE...
A WEAK PRESSURE PATTERN WILL RESULT IN LIGHT WINDS (10 KNOTS OR 
LESS) THROUGH THURSDAY...FAVORING AN EASTERLY COMPONENT. WINDS WILL 
BECOME VARIABLE FRIDAY BEFORE SHIFTING TO THE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST 
THIS WEEKEND...AS THE ATLANTIC RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS FURTHER SOUTH AND 
EAST OVER THE STRAITS OF FLORIDA AND CUBA.

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
OVERNIGHT...INCLUDING AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FOUND ALONG THE ROUTE...MAINLY OVER THE 
MAINLAND AND UPPER KEYS PORTIONS THROUGH THIS EVENING. THESE WILL BE 
CIRCUMNAVIGABLE...AND SHOULD DIMINISH OVERNIGHT. OTHERWISE ONLY 
BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED ALONG THE ROUTE AND AT KEYW

A WEAK TROUGH REMAINS DRAPED OVER THE WESTERN BAHAMAS (JUST EAST OF 
THE KEYS) THIS MORNING. ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE PASSED OVER PORTIONS 
OF THE LOWER KEYS...MAINLY OVER AND AROUND KEY WEST THIS MORNING. AN 
ADDITIONAL TENTH OF AN INCH OF RAIN HAS FALLEN THIS MORNING...ADDING 
TO THE EARLIER RAIN EPISODE OVERNIGHT TO A TOTAL OF 0.35 INCHES FOR 
THE DAY AT KEY WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT. THESE SHOWERS OCCURRED 
ALONG CUMULUS CLOUD LINES WHICH ALSO SPAWNED AROUND 4 WATERSPOUTS 
AND 2 FUNNEL CLOUDS BETWEEN 730 AM AND 830 AM. THIS MORNINGS 
SOUNDING DEPICTED CALM TO LIGHT NORTHEAST WINDS FROM THE SURFACE TO 
800 MB...WHICH SUPPORTS FUNNEL CLOUD AND WATERSPOUT FORMATION. 

SUNNY SKIES PREVAIL OVER THE UPPER AND MIDDLE KEYS...WHILE THE LOWER 
KEYS REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY. TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM THE UPPER 70S IN 
KEY WEST (DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND EARLIER RAINS) TO THE MID 80S IN 
MARATHON. DEWPOINTS RANGE FROM 70 TO 73 DEGREES. CMAN PLATFORMS AND 
ASOS STATIONS HAVE BEEN REPORTING A VARIETY OF WIND DIRECTIONS 
BETWEEN NORTH AND EAST AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS. 

.FORECAST...
CLOUD COVER OVER THE LOWER KEYS SHOULD SLOWLY ERODE LATE THIS 
MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON. THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN THIS AFTERNOON 
WILL BE IN THE LOWER KEYS WHERE EXISTING BOUNDARIES COULD 
INTERACT...OR OVER THE UPPER KEYS WITH PASSING SHOWERS FROM THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS CURRENTLY EAST OF MIAMI. A 20 PERCENT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND STORMS THIS AFTERNOON ACCOUNTS FOR THESE SCENARIOS...AND 
THEREFORE NO UPDATES ARE PLANNED AT THIS TIME. 

&&
.MARINE...
LIGHT NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS WILL PREVAIL OVER THE KEYS COASTAL 
WATERS THIS AFTERNOON (OUTSIDE OF CONVECTION AND BOUNDARIES). 
MARINERS SHOULD BE ALERT FOR GUSTY WINDS NEAR ANY DEVELOPING SHOWERS

VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE ISLAND TERMINALS TODAY. ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL AFFECT THE 
ROUTE THIS MORNING...WITH THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING IN THE AFTERNOON

OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM OLD SOUTH FLORIDA CONVECTION INTERACTED WITH 
OLD CU LINES ACROSS THE KEYS LATE LAST EVENING...RESULTING IN A FEW 
CLUSTERS OF HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE LOWER KEYS. 
AROUND 3 INCHES WERE MEASURED AT A COUPLE OF KEY WEST RAIN GAUGES. 
SYNOPTICALLY A LARGE CUT OFF LOW IS MEANDERING TO THE NORTHEAST OF 
BERMUDA. THE KEYS ARE IN THE DRIER CIRCULATION ON THE LEFT SIDE OF 
THIS SYSTEM. AT THE SURFACE...A PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE NORTH 
ATLANTIC STRETCHES SOUTHWESTWARD ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST...AND INTO 
FLORIDA. A STUBBORN INVERTED TROUGH HAS BEEN TUCKED IN SOUTH OF THIS 
RIDGE...AND JUST EAST OF THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. WINDS ACROSS THE

EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED ONLY 1.32 INCHES PWAT...WITH A COUPLE OF 
TEMPERATURE INVERSIONS BETWEEN 7 AND 15 KFT. AS A RESULT...CAPE IS 
LIMITED.

.FORECAST...
THE CUT OFF LOW OVER THE ATLANTIC WILL MEANDER AROUND FOR A FEW MORE 
DAYS BEFORE IT BEGINS TO GET REABSORBED IN THE WESTERLIES. WHILE 
THIS LOW SITS SHARP RIDGING ACROSS THE GULF AND EASTERN STATES WILL 
GRADUALLY WEAKEN AS THE NEXT MID LATITUDE TROUGH SHIFTS 
SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE LOWER 48. AT THE LOWER LEVELS...THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BE NEARLY STATIONARY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS. THE SHARP INVERTED TROUGH EAST OF FLORIDA SHOULD SHIFT 
WESTWARD ACROSS FLORIDA TODAY AND SLOWLY DAMPEN OUT. HOWEVER...LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL INCREASE AS THE TROUGH PUSHES THROUGH. ENHANCED 
CLOUD TOPS AND SCATTERED CONVECTION IS ALREADY SEEN ON RADAR EAST OF 
THE TROUGH AXIS. WINDS WILL BE NORTHEAST TO EAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD THEN BECOME MORE EAST THIS EVENING. WILL 
INCREASE POPS TO CHANCE FOR TODAY. THROUGH THIS WEEKEND...THE 
ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL MOVE SOUTHWARD OVER THE STRAITS AS A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFTS EASTWARD OFF OF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST. 
TOMORROW THROUGH THIS WEEKEND WILL RETURN TO NORMAL TEMPS AND POPS.

IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD SUNDAY NIGHT AND BEYOND...GUIDANCE INDICATES 
THE SUB TROPICAL JET WILL SHIFT NORTHWARD NEAR THE KEYS AND 
STRENGTHEN AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES ACROSS THE EASTERN 
STATES. FOR NOW WILL NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE LOCAL FORECAST...BUT 
THIS COULD INDICATE A WET PATTERN NEXT WEEK.

.MARINE...
MAINLY NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS OF AROUND 10 KNOTS IS EXPECTED ACROSS 
MOST KEYS WATERS TODAY. A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH WILL SHIFT WESTWARD 
ACROSS FLORIDA AND THE KEYS TODAY AND THIS EVENING. WINDS WILL 
BECOME MORE EAST TO SOUTHEAST TONIGHT AND SHIFT TO SOUTHEASTWARD. 
WINDS GRADUALLY VEER TO MORE SOUTHWESTERLY BY THIS WEEKEND AS THE 
RIDGE SHIFTS INTO THE STRAITS.

CUMULUS CLOUDS HAVE OVERSPREAD THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS WITH KBYX 
DOPPLER RADAR INDICATING A LONE HEAVY SHOWER WITH TOPS TO 33K FEET 
MOVING WEST THROUGH SOUTHERN BIG PINE KEY. WINDS HAVE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST NEAR 5 KNOTS ACROSS THE MIDDLE AND LOWER KEYS COASTAL 
WATERS...AND ARE LIGHT AND VARIABLE ALONG THE UPPER KEYS. THE 
CONSTANT FLOW OFF THE ATLANTIC SIDE HAS KEPT TEMPERATURES HOVERING 
AROUND 80F...UNLIKE THE LAST FEW NIGHTS.

.FORECAST...
.TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY...
THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH OFF THE SOUTHEAST U.S. 
CONTINUES TO DIG THROUGH THE NORTHERN BAHAMAS KEEPING A NORTH TO 
NORTHWEST FLOW ABOVE 400 MB ACROSS THE KEYS. THE CORE OF THE UPPER 
LOW WITHIN THE TROUGH SHOULD GRADUALLY LIFT THROUGH THE WEST 
ATLANTIC EAST OF THE CAROLINAS BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...HOWEVER A TROUGH 
AXIS WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE NORTHWEST BAHAMAS THROUGH THURSDAY. AT 
THE LOW LEVELS...AN 850MB TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER FEATURE 
WILL SLOWLY MOVE WEST THROUGH THE KEYS LATE WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. 
THIS LOW LEVEL TROUGH IS RATHER BROAD AND MAY ONLY SERVE TO VEER 
WINDS TO THE SOUTHEAST BELOW 700 MB WITH A MODEST INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE DEPTH. THIS COULD BRING A FEW MORE SHOWERS INTO THE AREA 
THURSDAY. WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER REMAINING NEAR 1.4 INCHES...NOT 
EXPECTING MUCH OTHER THAN A STRUGGLING CUMULUS LINE MIDDAY TUESDAY. 
STEERING FLOW IS OUT OF THE NORTHEAST WHICH MAY BRING MAINLAND 
CONVECTION INTO THE GULF WATERS...BUT LIKE MONDAY PROBABLY NOT TOO 
FAR INTO THE KEYS GULF WATERS. PRECIPITABLE WATERS MAY CLIMB BACK 
ABOVE 1.6 INCHES WEDNESDAY AND A LITTLE HIGHER THURSDAY. THURSDAY 
MAY HAVE MORE MOISTURE FOR GREATER THUNDER COVERAGE...EXCEPT THE 
STEERING FLOW IS SOUTHERLY...WEAK...AND ALSO NOT A GOOD SETUP FOR A 
STRONG CUMULUS LINE. ACTIVITY OVER THE MAINLAND SHOULD LARGELY STAY 
ON THE MAINLAND. THEREFORE WILL MAINTAIN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THROUGH 
MIDWEEK. NO CHANGE IN TEMPERATURES...HOWEVER LIKE MONDAY EXPECT 
TEMPERATURES OVER MOST ISLANDS TO BE PERILOUSLY CLOSE TO THE 90 
DEGREE MARK.

.FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...
THE UPPER TROUGH FINALLY FILLS BY EARLY SATURDAY AS A MORE POWERFUL 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH FROM THE NORTHERN LATITUDES SWEEPS OFF THE NEW 
ENGLAND/MID ATLANTIC COAST BY SUNDAY. TAIL END OF THIS TROUGH 
SLUGGISHLY MOVES INTO THE NORTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO BY MONDAY. AT THE 
SURFACE...THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROUGH WEAKENS WHAT 
LITTLE RIDGING EXISTS ACROSS FLORIDA. OTHER THAN ISLAND CUMULUS 
LINES...THERE ARE NOT MANY WAYS TO BRING SIGNIFICANT SHOWER COVERAGE 
INTO THE KEYS. 30/00Z GFS RUN DEVELOPS TROUGHING THROUGH THE BAHAMAS 
AGAIN...POSSIBLY AS RESULT OF THE APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH. AFTER 
SEEING THIS FEATURE COME AND GO IN THE DAY 8 TO 12 RANGE THE PAST 
SEVERAL DAYS...I AM NOT WILLING TO JUMP ON ITS PRESENCE AND WILL 
MAINTAIN EAST FLOW DUE TO THE POST-FRONTAL HIGH OVER THE CAROLINAS.

&&
.MARINE...
NO FLAGS. WITH A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
PENINSULA...EXPECT MAINLY EAST WINDS THE NEXT FEW DAYS 5 TO 10 
KNOTS WITH SOME SEABREEZE ONSHORE FLOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN BAY THE 
NEXT COUPLE AFTERNOONS. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE. A TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST STATES BY FRIDAY 
WILL CAUSE THE RIDGE TO RETREAT INTO THE ATLANTIC...AND WINDS COULD 
COLLAPSE TO LIGHT AND VARIABLE AGAIN FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. 

&&
.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED ALONG THE MIAMI TO KEY WEST FLIGHT 
ROUTE...AND AT KEYS TERMINALS. THIS MORNING ISOLATED PATCHES OF MVFR 
BR WILL DEVELOP IN THE LIGHT FLOW OVER INTERIOR SOUTH FLORIDA...AND 
A FEW MVFR/IFR SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FOUND ALONG THE 
ROUTE...MAINLY ALONG A NUMBER OF CLOUD LINES ACROSS THE MARINE 
PORTIONS OF THE ROUTE. LATER THIS AFTERNOON...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER SOUTH FLORIDA 
ALONG SEA BREEZE ACTIVITY. TOWARDS EARLY EVENING...THIS ACTIVITY IS

.DISCUSSION...

.CURRENTLY...
CLEAR SKIES DOMINATE THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS EARLY THIS 
MEMORIAL DAY MORNING. TEMPERATURES ARE HOLDING AROUND 80 
DEGREES...AND WINDS ACROSS THE LOWER KEYS HAVE REMAINED OUT OF THE 
NORTH 5 KNOTS OR LESS. WINDS ARE NEARLY CALM ELSEWHERE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
AN UPPER TROPOSPHERIC TROUGH CONTINUES TO DIG OFFSHORE THE CAROLINAS 
AND IS LIKELY TO BECOME POSITIONED JUST NORTH OF THE NORTHERN 
BAHAMAS BY LATE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. RIDGING WILL HOLD ACROSS THE 
EASTERN U.S. 

PRECIPITABLE WATER AS MEASURED BY THE KEY WEST RAWINSONDES FROM 00Z 
SUNDAY THROUGH 00Z MONDAY HAS DROPPED FOUR TENTHS OF AN INCH. DEW 
POINT DEPRESSIONS FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH 700 MB WERE 7 TO 10 
CELSIUS...AND IT IS LIKELY THE ISLAND CUMULUS LINE WILL LIKELY HAVE 
ONLY A FEW HOURS TO WORK WITH YET AGAIN TODAY. STEERING FLOW FROM 
850 TO 700 MB HAS BECOME ESTABLISHED OUT OF THE NORTH TO NORTHEAST 
10 TO 15 KNOTS...AND ONCE AGAIN SOME CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OVER THE 
MAINLAND THIS AFTERNOON IS LIKELY TO BE DRIVEN SOUTH OVER FLORIDA 
BAY AND INTO THE UPPER AND PERHAPS MIDDLE KEYS LATE THIS AFTERNOON. 
THUS THE 30 POPS...HIGHER THAN GUIDANCE AS OF LATE...ARE STILL 
WARRANTED. WITH THE DRY AIR ALOFT SOME GUSTY WINDS COULD RESULT WITH 
THE THUNDERSTORMS. BY TUESDAY CONTINUED MARGINAL MOISTURE DEPTH AND 
A BREAKDOWN OF THE NORTHERLY STEERING FOR CONVECTION OFF THE 
MAINLAND LEAVES PRECIPITATION LARGELY IN THE HANDS OF THE CUMULUS 
LINE. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WILL CONTINUE TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
NAM CONTINUES TO BE FURTHER SOUTH WITH THE POSITIONING OF THE 
VORTMAX IN THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH...HOWEVER BOOTH GFS AND NAM 
INDICATE SOME LOW LEVEL TROUGHING WITH SIMILAR AXIS 12Z WEDNESDAY AT 
850 MB. NAM IS STILL STRONG WITH ITS SOLUTION OF A CLOSED LOW ACROSS 
SOUTH/CENTRAL FLORIDA. PREFER THE MORE OPEN GFS LOOK WITH 
LIGHT...CONFUSED FLOW DOMINATED BY DIURNAL HEATING AND TROUGHING 
OVER THE PENINSULA. THE INCREASE IN DEPTH OF MOISTURE ON GFS TIME 
HEIGHT SECTIONS IS A BIT INTERESTING...HOWEVER NO DEEP SOUTHEAST 
FLOW BECOMES ESTABLISHED AS MID/UPPER LEVEL WINDS REMAIN DOMINATED 
BY THE UPPER TROUGH TO THE EAST. AT THIS POINT NOT READY TO BOOST 
POPS INTO CHANCE CATEGORY FOR LATE WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY...BUT IT 
IS A POSSIBILITY SHOULD THE LOW LEVEL TROUGHING BE SHARPER THAN 
CURRENTLY EXPECTED. IN ANY CASE...THE LOW LEVEL TROUGH WASHES OUT 
BEFORE IT GETS TOO FAR INTO THE EASTERN GULF...WITH ATLANTIC HIGH 
PRESSURE NOSING INTO THE STRAITS. ANOTHER FRONT PUSHING OFF THE MID 
ATLANTIC COAST LATE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WILL SLOW THE ADVANCE OF THE 
RIDGE NORTHWARD...ONLY MAKING SOUTH FLORIDA BY SUNDAY. 

&&
.MARINE...
THE LACK OF SIGNFICANT HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING WILL KEEP WINDS VERY 
LIGHT. WATCH FOR SHIFTING WINDS THE NEXT COUPLE AFTERNOONS ACROSS 
FLORIDA BAY AND UPPER KEYS AS THE SEABREEZE DEVELOPS NEAR THE 
MAINLAND. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL ALSO ROLL OFF THE MAINLAND INTO 
FLORIDA BAY DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON HOURS AS WELL. WHAT HAS BEEN 
BAD FOR THE SAILORS...VERY LIGHT TO NEAR CALM WINDS...HAS BEEN EASY 
ON THE SEAS. SEAS WILL GENERALLY BE 3 FEET OR LESS ON THE STRAITS 
THROUGH SUNDAY. 

&&
.AVIATION...
TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL OVERNIGHT ALONG THE ROUTE MIAMI 
TO KEY WEST...AND AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. ON THE 
MAINLAND...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP 
NEAR THE COLLISION OF GULF AND ATLANTIC SEABREEZE BOUNDARIES OVER 
THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND AFTER 16Z. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS 
WILL SOUTHWARD ACROSS FLORIDA BAY...POSSIBLY IMPACTING THE KEYW AND 
KMTH TERMINALS BY LATE IN THE DAY. SHORT LIVED MVFR/IFR CIGS AND VIS 
ARE POSSIBLE WITHIN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
EARLY THIS EVENING...A FAIRLY ROBUST CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS MOVED 
OFF THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND AND INTO THE FLORIDA BAY...BEFORE 
WEAKENING RAPIDLY AS IT APPROACHED THE UPPER KEYS BETWEEN 
TAVERNIER AND CRAIG KEY. SINCE THAT CONVECTIVE CLUSTER...NO 
ADDITIONAL PRECIPITATION ACTIVITY HAS IMPACTED THE FLORIDA KEYS OR 
SURROUNDING WATERS. MEANWHILE...OUR AREA IS BETWEEN TWO AREAS OF 
HIGH PRESSURE...ONE OVER THE EAST CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO AND A 
WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE REACHING INTO THE FLORIDA STRAITS. IN BETWEEN 
THESE TWO AREAS OF HIGH PRESSURE...A THERMAL LOW IS SLOWLY WEAKENING 
OVER THE SOUTH FLORIDA PENINSULA. ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN 
STATION PLATFORM OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SOUTHEAST TO SOUTH WINDS OF 5 
TO 10 KNOTS...WHILE LOCAL RADARS ARE DETECTING DISSIPATING ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE WESTERN PORTION OF 
GLADES...HENDRY AND COLLIER COUNTIES. OTHERWISE...OUR EVENING 
SOUNDING REVEALS A WELL PRONOUNCED DRY LAYER FROM THE SURFACE TO 700 
MB...WITH A LIGHT AND VARIABLE WIND FLOW OVERLAID BY A NORTH TO 
NORTHEAST FLOW ABOVE 950 MB. 

.FORECAST...
GIVEN A VERY DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE...A WEAK AND NEBULOUS WIND FLOW 
AND ABSOLUTELY NO LARGE SCALE LIFT NEARBY SHOULD PRECLUDE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION ECHOES FROM IMPACTING THE ISLAND CHAIN. 
WITH LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS...RADIATIONAL COOLING IS ONCE AGAIN A 
POSSIBILITY. HENCE...HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE FORECAST TO REMOVE 
POPS AND OPEN UP A LOW TEMPERATURE RANGE. 

&&

.MARINE...
OUR EVENING RAWINDSONDE INDICATES LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS OF LESS 
THAN 5 KNOTS AT 1 AND 2 THOUSAND FEET WHILE THE KBYX VWP SUPPORTS 
IT. WITH THE THERMAL TROUGH OVER SOUTH FLORIDA DISSIPATING 
TONIGHT...WINDS SHOULD BECOME MOSTLY EASTERLY AT 5 TO 10 KNOTS ON 
THE ATLANTIC WATERS...AND VARIABLE NORTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN. 
OTHERWISE...WILL REMOVE THUNDERSTORMS ON ALL WATERS...BUT MAINTAIN 
ISOLATED SHOWERS.

345 PM EDT SUN MAY 28 2006

.DISCUSSION...

.CURRENTLY...
SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLEAR ALONG THE FLORIDA KEYS THIS AFTERNOON. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 80S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID 
70S. WINDS ALONG THE ISLANDS ARE NORTH TO NORTHEAST AT 5 TO 10 
MPH...AND ON THE REEF ARE VARIABLE AT LESS THAN 10 KT...EXCEPT NEAR 
10 KT ON THE WATERS AROUND DRY TORTUGAS. KBYX DETECTS NO ECHOES IN 
OUR AREA...WITH ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OCCURRING OVER 
THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY)...
A MID AND UPPER HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IS LOCATED OVER THE EASTERN 
U.S. AND A LARGE MID AND UPPER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS MOVING SLOWLY 
SOUTHWARD OFF THE COAST OF NORTH CAROLINA. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT 
BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS IS PRODUCING NORTHERLY WINDS ALOFT...WHICH 
HAVE BROUGHT IN DRIER AIR ABOVE THE LOW LEVELS AND CLEARED OUT THE 
HIGH CLOUDS THAT BLANKETED THE KEYS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. WITH 
RESPLENDENT SUNSHINE ACROSS THE ISLANDS TODAY KEY WEST REACHED A 
HIGH OF 87 DEGREES (SO FAR)...WHICH IS ITS WARMEST TEMPERATURE SINCE 
OCTOBER 14 2005.

THE SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WHICH HAS LINGERED NEAR OUR AREA 
WILL PERSIST OVERNIGHT BEFORE BEING PUSHED EASTWARD BY MONDAY NIGHT 
BY AN APPROACHING TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE. THUS LIGHT AND MOSTLY 
VARIABLE SURFACE WINDS WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. THE DRIER 
AIR ALOFT SQUELCHED THE CLOUD LINE THAT DEVELOPED SOUTH OF THE LOWER 
KEYS EARLIER TODAY AND...ALONG WITH WEAK NORTH TO NORTHEASTERLY FLOW 
IN THE LOW LEVELS...SHOULD SOMEWHAT INHIBIT CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT 
ON MONDAY AS WELL. HOWEVER...THE SOUTH FLORIDA MAINLAND WILL BE 
CONVECTIVELY ACTIVE ONCE AGAIN TOMORROW...AND WITH NORTH TO 
NORTHEASTERLY STEERING FLOW SOME OF THE SHOWERS AND STORMS COULD 
MOVE INTO FLORIDA BAY AND THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS MONDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. THUS HAVE MAINTAINED 30 POPS FOR MONDAY OVER THE 
ISLANDS AND BAY...AND 20 ON THE WATERS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
AS THE MID AND UPPER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES SOUTH SOUTHWESTWARD 
TOWARD OUR AREA...AN ASSOCIATED LOW LEVEL TROUGH WILL ALSO APPROACH 
SOUTH FLORIDA FROM THE NORTHEAST. THE MODELS DISAGREE AS TO HOW FAR 
SOUTHWARD THIS SYSTEM WILL PROGRESS. THE GFS ONLY BRINGS THE 
MID/UPPER LOW CENTER TO A FEW HUNDRED MILES NORTH OF THE BAHAMAS BY 
WEDNESDAY...WHILE THE ETA BRINGS IT TO THE NORTHERN TIP OF THE 
BAHAMAS. THIS IN TURN CREATES DIFFERENCES IN SURFACE 
CONDITIONS...WHERE THE GFS HAS EASTERLY WINDS OVER THE KEYS ON 
WEDNESDAY WITH THE SURFACE TROUGH WELL TO OUR NORTHEAST...WHILE THE 
ETA HAS WESTERLY WINDS IN OUR AREA WITH A SURFACE LOW OVER SOUTH 
FLORIDA. BASED ON THE LOCATION AND STRENGTH OF STEERING SYSTEMS OVER 
THE CONTINENTAL UNITED STATES...THE GFS SOLUTION SEEMS MORE 
LIKELY...THUS THE OUTGOING FORECAST PACKAGE INDICATES SURFACE WINDS 
BECOMING EASTERLY BY TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY. THEREAFTER...NEAR 
CLIMATOLOGICAL CONDITIONS SHOULD PERSIST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE 
WEEK WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

&&

.DISCUSSION...

.CURRENTLY...
AHEAD OF A MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHING THE KEYS FROM THE 
NORTH...WINDS FROM 500 MB HAVE TURNED TO WNW OR NW AND THE HIGH 
CLOUDS THAT HAVE PLAGUED OUR AREA FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS HAVE 
FINALLY MOVED OUT. SKIES ARE NEARLY CLEAR IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 
KEYS...AND PARTLY CLOUDY IN THE LOWER KEYS DUE TO SOME LINGERING 
ALTOCUMULUS. TEMPERATURES ARE CLIMBING THROUGH THE LOWER 80S AND 
WINDS ALONG THE ISLANDS ARE NORTHEAST TO EAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. CMAN 
STATIONS REPORT WINDS LESS THAN 10 KT ON THE REEF...WITH DIRECTIONS 
BETWEEN NORTHEAST AND SOUTHEAST. NO PRECIPITATION IS DETECTED BY 
KBYX RADAR.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
AT THE SURFACE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL LIE NEAR 
THE KEYS TODAY...RESULTING IN VERY LIGHT FLOW. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN 
AROUND 10 KT OR LESS ON THE ATLANTIC WATERS...LESS THAN 10 KT ON THE 
GULF AND BAY...AND 10 MPH OR LESS ON LAND. LOW-LEVEL WINDS WILL BE 
GENERALLY NORTHEAST TO EAST. THESE CONDITIONS WILL PROMOTE THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUD LINES ALONG AND NEAR THE ISLANDS...ESPECIALLY 
THIS AFTERNOON. NORTHEASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS ALSO INCREASES 
THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION OVER SOUTH FLORIDA MOVING INTO FLORIDA 
BAY AND THE UPPER KEYS THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING. WINDS SHOULD BECOME 
VERY LIGHT AND VARIABLE OVERNIGHT...EXCEPT OVER THE FLORIDA STRAITS 
WHERE THEY WILL REMAIN NORTHEAST TO EAST NEAR 10 KNOTS.

IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...THE HIGH PRESSURE THAT PRODUCED ZONAL 
WEST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVERHEAD FOR THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS HAS BEEN 
NUDGED SOUTH BY A TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE NORTH...WHICH WILL 
REACH OUR AREA OVERNIGHT. WINDS ALOFT WILL TURN EVEN MORE TOWARD 
NORTHWEST AND EVENTUALLY NORTH AS THE TROUGH PASSES. THE LOSS OF 
WEST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW HAS LOWERED MOISTURE IN THE MID AND UPPER 
LEVELS. PWAT ON THE 12Z KEY WEST RAOB HAS DROPPED TO 1.64 (FROM 1.87 
YESTERDAY EVENING). THIS DRIER AIR ALOFT WILL BE THE MAIN FACTOR 
THAT COULD INHIBIT CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT TODAY.

OTHER THAN ISLAND CLOUD LINES AND THE POSSIBLITY OF CONVECTION 
MOVING OFF THE MAINLAND...BOTH OF WHICH WILL OCCUR PRIMARILY THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
EXPECTED TODAY AND TONIGHT.

THE CURRENT ZONE PACKAGE HANDLES THIS SITUATION WELL...AND NO UPDATE 
IS EXPECTED.

BE ACCOMPANIED BY ISOLATED IFR CONDITIONS IN SHRA/TSRA. ROUTE 
SEGMENT 60SW KMIA-KEYW MAY BE AFFECTED BY MORE CONCENTRATED

.DISCUSSION...

.CURRENTLY...
SKIES HAVE FINALLY BECOMING PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLEAR EARLY THIS 
MORNING WITH THE DENSE HIGH ALTITUDE CLOUDINESS HAVING ERODED. THE 
NORTHERN EDGE NOW IS JUST OFFSHORE THE REEF. TEMPERATURES HAVE 
REMAINED STEADY IN THE UPPER 70S...AND EARLIER SHOWERS THAT MOVED 
ACROSS THE EXTREME UPPER KEYS HAVE DISSIPATED. WINDS ARE NORTHEAST 
ACROSS THE ISLAND CHAIN AND UPPER KEYS WATERS...AND MORE EASTERLY 
OVER THE STRAITS WITH SPEEDS 4 TO 10 KNOTS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY)...
IN THE MIDDLE TO UPPER TROPOSPHERE...A RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD OVER 
THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS WITH A TROUGH DIGGING OFF THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD JUST WEST OF BERMUDA. A WEAK UPPER TROUGH UNDERCUTTING THE 
RIDGE IS CURRENTLY PROVIDING WEST-SOUTHWEST HIGH ALTITUDE FLOW WHICH 
IS EXPECTED TO FINALLY SHUNT THE DENSE CIRRUS AND AREAS OF 
ALTOCUMULUS EAST OF THE AREA. AS THE UPPER TROUGH OFF THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD DIGS...THE UPPER FLOW BECOMES NORTHERLY. ALL THE 
WHILE...THE MID LEVELS DRY OUT WITH MOISTURE LIMITED TO BELOW 700 MB.

CLOSER TO THE SURFACE...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING FROM THE WEST 
ATLANTIC ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA WILL BROADEN YET REMAIN WEAK 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST U.S. THIS WILL KEEP THE LOW LEVEL FLOW 
NORTHEAST TO EAST THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. AN UPPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS 
EXPECTED TO SHARPEN A BIT ACROSS NEW ENGLAND AND THE MID ATLANTIC 
THIS WEEKEND...RESULTING IN THE LOWER LEVEL RIDGE BEING SUPPRESSED 
BACK TO SOUTH FLORIDA. 

THE FORECAST CONCERNS FOR TODAY WILL BE THE LIGHT BACKING LOW LEVEL 
FLOW...SUPPORTING OF A TOWERING CUMULUS LINE THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
THE EVOLUTION OF DEEPER NORTHERLY FLOW FROM ABOVE THE SURFACE 
THROUGH AT LEAST 10K FEET THIS EVENING. DRYING ALOFT AND THE LACK OF 
SYNOPTIC SCALE LEFT WILL KEEP COVERAGE LOW...BUT THE MID LEVEL 
DRYING IN CONCERT WITH THE NORTHERLY LOW-TO-MID LEVEL FLOW MAY ALLOW 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES TO SLIDE SOUTH INTO FLORIDA BAY AND THE UPPER 
KEYS. THUS...TWO MECHANISMS FOR A LITTLE THUNDER WILL BE 
PRESENT...BOTH WITH AN AFTERNOON ISLAND CUMULUS LINE AND WITH 
PERHAPS LATE AFTERNOON CONVECTION BRIEFLY ROLLING OFF THE MAINLAND. 
THE LOW CHANCE POPS ARE CURRENTLY JUST ABOVE GUIDANCE AND WILL 
REMAIN TODAY. AND...THE SHIFTING OF MID/UPPER CLOUD COVER FURTHER 
EAST WARRANTS A MORE OPTIMISTIC PARTLY CLOUDY WORDING.

LOW LEVEL WIND FIELD SUPPORTS A CUMULUS LINE DURING MEMORIAL DAY 
AFTERNOON AS WELL...BUT MOISTURE IS LIMITED. IT MAY IN FACT BE THE 
ONLY SIGNIFICANT MECHANISM FOR RAINFALL ON MONDAY. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
AS THE RIDGE ADJUSTS A BIT FURTHER NORTH FLOW BECOMES A BIT MORE 
EASTERLY WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT TRIGGERS. FLOW 
WILL MAINTAIN THE SLIGHT CHANCE CLIMO POPS. 

&&

.MARINE...
LIGHT TO OCCASIONALLY GENTLE SURFACE WINDS WILL OCCUR ACROSS THE 
STRAITS...MUCH LIGHTER AND MORE VARIABLE OVER FLORIDA BAY AND THE 
GULF SIDE WATERS DUE TO AN AFTERNOON SEABREEZE. WITH MORE NORTHERLY 
STEERING FOR THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED TO EVOLVE BY LATE 
TODAY...BOOSTED COVERAGE OF SHOWERS/THUNDER FOR FLORIDA BAY ONLY 
INTO SCATTERED CATEGORY...MAINLY FOR LATER THIS AFTERNOON.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE 
AND AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. ON THE 
MAINLAND...GRADUALLY CLEARING SKIES THIS MORNING COMBINED WITH 
ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW FOR SOME 
PATCHY BR/FOG CLOSE TO THE EVERGLADES...BUT THIS SHOULD DISSIPATE 
RAPIDLY BY ONE HOUR AFTER SUNRISE. AFTER 16Z...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AND SLIDE SOUTHWEST TO SOUTH 
BETWEEN 5 AND 10 KNOTS. 

AT THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS...LIGHT NORTHEAST WINDS FROM 
THE SURFACE TO 10 KFT THIS MORNING...AND LATER AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON 
WILL ALLOW FOR DEVELOPMENT OF A CUMULUS LINE IN THE VICINITY OF THE 
TERMINALS. ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE ACROSS 
FLORIDA BAY AND THE GULF WATERS NORTH OF THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS 
DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON...RESULTING IN DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED

.CURRENTLY...
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES COVER THE FLORIDA KEYS DUE TO THICK HIGH CLOUD 
COVER. TEMPERATURES ALONG THE ISLANDS ARE IN THE MID 80S AND NO RAIN 
IS DETECTED IN OUR AREA. WINDS ARE VARIABLE AT 5 TO 10 MPH ALONG THE 
ISLANDS...AND VARIABLE AT 5 TO 10 KT ON THE WATER...EXCEPT 5 KT OR 
LESS ON WATERS ADJACENT TO THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY)...
EARLIER TODAY A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE LAY ACROSS SOUTH 
FLORIDA JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS. AS THE MAINLAND WARMED UNDER THE SUN 
A DIFFERENTIAL HEATING LOW FORMED OVER SOUTH FLORIDA...SEVERING THE 
RIDGE AND FORMING A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN 
GULF. THIS RESULTED IN WINDS AROUND THE LOWER KEYS AND WESTWARD 
SHIFTING TO NORTH NORTHEAST AND INCREASING A BIT. AS THE AFTERNOON 
PROGRESSES...AND ESPECIALLY AFTER SUNSET...THE RIDGE WILL COALESCE 
NEAR THE KEYS RESULTING IN VERY LIGHT WINDS OVERNIGHT. 
MEANWHILE...OUR AREA REMAINS UNDER NEARLY ZONAL SOUTHWESTERLY TO 
WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH MID AND UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE IN THE 
CARIBBEAN. THIS FLOW CONTINUES TO BRING MOISTURE INTO THE 
AREA...WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE FOR OUR HIGH LEVEL CLOUD COVER.

NOT MUCH WILL CHANGE IN TERMS OF LOW FLOW AND PRESSURE PATTERNS 
AROUND THE KEYS IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL REMAIN 
NEAR THE AREA...MOVING A BIT NORTH OR SOUTH...KEEPING WINDS 
GENERALLY 10 MPH OR LESS ON LAND AND 10 KT OR LESS ON THE WATER. 
ALOFT...THE NEARLY ZONAL FLOW WILL LESSEN AS A MID TO UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH MOVES INTO THE AREA BY LATE SUNDAY. THIS WILL CAUSE WINDS TO 
BECOME NORTHWESTERLY AND WE WILL LOSE OUR THICK HIGH CLOUDS SHORTLY 
THEREAFTER.

LOW-LEVEL CONDITIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR CLOUD LINES ALONG AND 
NEAR THE ISLANDS ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY. FORECAST WIND PROFILES SHOW 
EAST NORTHEASTERLY FLOW WITH SLIGHT BACKING ABOVE THE SURFACE AND 
SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. IF THE MID-UPPER TROUGH IS SLOW 
TO MOVE IN AND CLEAR OUT OUR CEILINGS TOMORROW THE CLOUD LINE MAY BE 
INHIBITED...BUT THIS SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM ON MONDAY. WILL CARRY 
CHANCE POPS OVER LAND ON SUNDAY AND RAISE TO CHANCE POPS ON MONDAY. 
HOWEVER...OUTSIDE OF CLOUD LINES...ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE ANTICIPATED FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...THUS WILL 
KEEP SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS OVER THE WATER.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
AFTER THE MID-UPPER LEVEL TROUGH PASSES THROUGH OUR AREA A HIGH 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BUILD DOWN THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED 
STATES...BRINGING SUBSIDENCE AND DRIER AIR ALOFT SOMETIME ON

A FEW LOW CUMULUS CLOUDS POPULATE OUR AREA THIS MORNING...ALONG WITH 
CONSIDERABLE MID AND HIGH CLOUDS PRODUCING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE LOW 80S AND WINDS ALONG THE ISLANDS ARE 
LIGHT AND VARIABLE. CMAN STATIONS ARE INDICATING VARIABLE WINDS 
AROUND 5 KNOTS ON THE WATER. KBYX RADAR DETECTS ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WELL SOUTH OF THE UPPER KEYS...AND ONLY A FEW 
SPRINKLES ELSEWHERE IN THE STRAITS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY)...
AT THE SURFACE...AN ATLANTIC RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE STRETCHES ACROSS 
SOUTH FLORIDA. THIS RIDGE WILL SLIDE SOUTHWARD AND BE VERY NEAR THE 
KEYS BY THIS EVENING. AS A RESULT SURFACE WINDS WILL REMAIN LIGHT 
AND VARIABLE...BUT SHOULD BECOME MAINLY EAST TO SOUTHEAST BY THIS 
AFTERNOON DUE TO ISLAND HEATING EFFECTS. IN THE MID AND UPPER 
LEVELS...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CARIBBEAN IS PRODUCING MOIST 
NEAR-ZONAL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER OUR AREA...WHICH IS RESPONSIBLE 
FOR OUR CONSIDERABLE MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS. THE 12Z KEY WEST 
RAOB INDICATES VERY LIGHT WINDS THROUGH ABOUT 8000 FT AGL...WITH 
SOMEWHAT DRY AIR AT LOW AND MID LEVELS BENEATH THE THICK 
CIRROSTRATUS DECK...BUT PWAT VALUE STILL NEAR 1.8 INCHES.

THE QUESTION FOR TODAY IS WHETHER CLOUDINESS WILL DECREASE ENOUGH 
FOR INSOLATION TO PRODUCE CLOUD LINES OVER AND NEAR THE KEYS...WHICH 
WOULD LEAD TO INCREASED COVERAGE OF PRECIPITATION. AT THIS TIME IT 
APPEARS THAT CLOUD COVER WILL REMAIN SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT 
SIGNIFICANT CLOUD LINE DEVELOPMENT. WILL BE UPDATING ZONE FORECAST 
SHORTLY TO GO MOSTLY CLOUDY AND TWEAK WINDS AND TEMPS...BUT WILL 
LEAVE POPS AT 20 PERCENT. IF CLOUDS BEGIN TO BREAK UP WILL HAVE TO 
REASSESS CHANCES OF PRECIP.

&&

.MARINE...
GENTLE SURFACE WINDS WILL PREVAIL ON ALL KEYS WATERS 
TODAY...GENERALLY FROM THE EAST TO SOUTHEAST EXCEPT NEAR THE 
MAINLAND COAST THIS AFTERNOON. NO ADVISORIES OR CAUTIONARY 
STATEMENTS ARE EXPECTED TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY.

&&

.AVIATION...
AT TERMINALS KEYW & KMTH...PREVAILING VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED THE 
NEXT 24 HOURS WITH WIDESPREAD MID AND HIGH CLOUDINESS PRODUCING 
CEILINGS AOA 10 THSD FT. ENOUGH LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE 
FOR ISOLATED TSRA ESPECIALLY AFTERNOON AND EARLY NIGHT 
PERIODS...PRODUCING BRIEF LOCAL MVFR CEILINGS AND IFR VISIBILITIES. 
ALONG KMIA-KEY ROUTE...MAINLAND SEGMENT OF THE ROUTE WILL SEE 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE PERIOD 18Z-02Z WHICH 
WILL PRODUCE IFR CEILINGS/VISIBILITIES AND SURFACE WIND GUSTS 30 KT 
WITHIN AND NEAR RAIN CORES.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
A FEW SPRINKLES POSSIBLY FALLING OVER THE WATERS SOUTH OF THE DRY 
TORTUGAS...OTHERWISE THE SERVICE AREA IS JUST COVERED BY HIGH 
CLOUDS...ALONG WITH A FEW FAIR WEATHER CU.  THIS IS ALL COURTESY OF 
A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER CENTRAL FLORIDA...THAT IS 
BRINGING WEAK EASTERLY SURFACE FLOW...PLUS A WEAK TROUGH OVER THE 
GULF...BRINGING HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE ON SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.  
NORMALLY...THIS COMBINATION OF SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND MOIST EAST 
FLOW AT THE SURFACE WOULD BE A SOMEWHAT WET PATTERN...BUT THE MID 
LEVELS HAVE BEEN WARM AND DRY...EFFECTIVELY CAPPING CONVECTION.  THE 
CAP COULD EASILY BE BROKEN BY SURFACE HEATING...BUT HIGH CLOUDS HAVE 
LIMITED IT.  EYW HAD A HIGH OF ONLY 83 YESTERDAY.  

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY)...
GIVEN FAVORABLE LIGHT EASTERLY FLOW...QUESTION FOR TODAY IS IF WE 
WILL GET ENOUGH SUN TO BREAK THE CAP AND PRODUCE A CU LINE OVER THE 
KEYS.  NAM SAYS NO...GFS SAYS MAYBE.  SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES 
CONTINUED CLOUDINESS...SO WILL GO WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES TODAY AND 
LOWER POPS JUST A BIT.  

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER OVER GULF WILL BE REPLACED BY WEAK RIDGE BY 
SUNDAY...PUTTING KEYS UNDER NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...WHILE MAINTAINING 
EASTERLY FLOW AT THE SURFACE.  THIS WILL CLEAR OUT THE UPPER LEVEL 
CLOUDS AND BRING ENOUGH HEATING FOR A CU LINE OVER THE 
ISLANDS...WILL UP THE POPS A BIT FOR SUNDAY.  BY MONDAY...THE RIDGE 
AXIS WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO BRING SUBSIDENCE...LOWERING THE CHANCE 
OF RAIN. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
MODELS SAY THE WEAK UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE 
GULF...WHILE THE LOW CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH THE MID ATLANTIC 
STATES ENDS UP AS A CUT OFF LOW OFF OF THE CAROLINA COAST.  THIS 
EFFECTIVELY PUTS THE KEYS IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...WHILE KEEPING 
WEAK EASTERLY FLOW AT THE SURFACE.  POPS AND TEMPS SHOULD BE NEAR 
CLIMO UNDER THIS SCENARIO.  

&&

.MARINE...
MAIN CONCERN WILL BE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS ON THE 
MAINLAND PRODUCING WIND GUSTS ACROSS FLORIDA BAY AND THE ATLANTIC 
SIDE OF THE UPPER KEYS TODAY AND ESPECIALLY SUNDAY.  OTHERWISE...
LIGHT TO GENTLE EAST SURFACE WINDS WILL PREVAIL ON ALL KEYS 
WATERS TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST WEDNESDAY. NO ADVISORIES OR 
CAUTIONARY STATEMENTS EXPECTED TONIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST WEDNESDAY. 

&&

.AVIATION...
MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED ALONG THE KMIA-KEYW TWEB ROUTE AND AT 
THE KEYW AND KMTH ISLAND TERMINALS. ACROSS THE ROUTE...EXPECT 
SCATTERED LOW CLOUDS AT 1500-2000 FEET...WITH A BROKEN DECK BETWEEN 
12 AND 15 KFT...WITH SOME EARLY AFTERNOON BREAKS. ON THE 
MAINLAND...INCREASED SURFACE TO 20000 FOOT LIFT AND MOISTURE WILL 
AID IN AFTERNOON SEABREEZE CONVECTION...RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AFTER 16Z. IN ADDITION...WIND 
GUSTS TO 30 KNOTS ARE POSSIBLE IN HEAVIER SHOWERS AND STORMS. OVER 
THE KEYS ISLAND TERMINALS...LIGHT SURFACE TO 10 KFT WINDS WILL ALLOW 
FOR AFTERNOON AND EVENING TCU LINES TO DEVELOP OVER AND IN THE

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
EARLY THIS EVENING...A NARROW BOUNDARY PRODUCED SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE EXTREME UPPER KEYS AND BACK COUNTRY OF THE 
FLORIDA BAY. THIS BOUNDARY BECAME ACTIVE WHEN AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY 
DROPPED SOUTHWARD FROM THE MAINLAND AND COLLIDED WITH IT. 
MEANWHILE...SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE FLORIDA KEYS AND 
SURROUNDING WATERS...WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DISSIPATING OVER 
THE MAINLAND. GOES-12 WATER VAPOR SHOWS A VERY DISTINCT BRANCH OF 
THE SUB-TROPICAL JET STREAM ORIENTED FROM OLD MEXICO TO ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO...AND ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. 
SURFACE ANALYSIS DEPICTS A WEAK WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE STRETCHING 
ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL FLORIDA...AND INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
ACROSS THE MARINE DISTRICT...C-MAN STATION PLATFORMS INDICATE EAST 
TO SOUTHEAST WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS. OTHERWISE...OUR EVENING 
SOUNDING REVEALS A VERY MOIST (PWAT 1.75 INCHES) AIRMASS IN PLACE 
WITH A LIGHT LOW LEVEL EASTERLY FLOW BEING OVERLAID BY A 
STRENGTHENING SOUTHWEST FLOW ABOVE 800 MB. 

.FORECAST...
DESPITE THE RELATIVELY ROBUST WINDS ALOFT...A LACK OF BOUNDARIES AND 
A DISTINCT AND SUBSTANTIAL DRY LAYER BETWEEN 850 AND 600 MB SHOULD 
PROMPT ONLY ISOLATED POPS OVERNIGHT. WITH A STEADY AND LIGHT EAST TO

ASSOCIATED RIDGE EXTENDS WESTWARD ACROSS FLORIDA. THIS WARM AND 
MOIST FLOW HAS KEPT LOW TEMPERATURES NEAR 80 THUS FAR WITH DEW POINT 
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER 70S. THIS PAST EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED 
CONTINUED LIGHT GENERALLY SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW THROUGH THE LOWEST 
LAYERS AND A NEARLY SATURATED SOUNDING WITH A FEW DRY LAYERS. THE 
SOUNDING INDICATED A PWAT OF 1.82 INCHES.

.FORECAST...
THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED HIGH PRESSURE CENTER WILL SHIFT FURTHER 
EASTWARD...WITH A RIDGE CONTINUING TO EXTEND WESTWARD ACROSS 
FLORIDA INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. THIS WILL KEEP WINDS GENERALLY EAST 
TO SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 10 MPH. PRECIP WISE...TODAYS FORECAST WILL 
BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAYS IN THAT THE LOW LEVELS WILL BE WARM AND 
MOIST ENOUGH FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP. THE CONTINUED 
PRESENCE OF THE SUBTROPICAL JET ALOFT WILL KEEP A LOT OF CIRRUS 
STREAMING OVER THE FORECAST AREA AND HIGH CHANCE OF PRECIP IN THE 
FORECAST. DESPITE THE AMPLE CIRRUS COVER...THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
HEATING FOR DAY TIME HIGHS TO REACH THE 85 TO 90 RANGE. CURRENT 
REASONING IS THINGS SHOULD STABILIZE BY TONIGHT...ALLOWING FOR ONLY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. CONTINUED LIGHT EAST TO SOUTHEAST FLOW WILL KEEP 
OVERNIGHT TEMPS IN THE UPPER 70S. THE SUBTROPICAL JET WILL WEAKEN 
CONSIDERABLY AND TRANSITION TO A MORE ZONAL FLOW ON SATURDAY...BUT 
WILL STILL BE IN PLACE OVER THE KEYS. SOME GUIDANCE INDICATES DRIER 
AIR IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...HOWEVER SOME DONT. IN ADDITION...THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER WILL STILL BE WARM AND MOIST WITH LITTLE 
INHIBITION...AND THE FLOW MAY BE FAVORABLE FOR BOTH CU LINE ACTIVITY 
AND MIGRATION OF SOUTH FLORIDA SEA BREEZE CONVECTION. WILL RAISE 
POPS TO LOW CHANCE.

HEADING INTO NEXT WEEK...THE SURFACE RIDGE OVER FLORIDA WILL BE 
PRESSED SOUTHWARD AND WEAKENED FURTHER BY A LOW SHIFTING OFF THE 
ATLANTIC COAST. MOST OF THE ENERGY WILL MOVE OFF NORTHEASTWARD...BUT 
SOME OF IT WILL CUT OFF AND DRIFT SOUTHWESTWARD AS IT SLOWLY 
DISSIPATES. THE LOCAL PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL WEAKEN A BIT FURTHER 
WITH WINDS ONLY IN THE 5 TO 10. ALOFT...FAIRLY SHARP RIDGING WILL 
DEVELOP ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN EASTERN STATES AND THE GULF OF 
MEXICO. IN ADDITION...THE KEYS WILL BE ON THE WESTWARD SIDE OF THE 
THE CUT OFF LOW. MID AND UPPER LEVELS WILL WARM AND DRY. TEMPS AND 
POPS WILL BE MORE IN LINE WITH CLIMO THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT 
WEEK. NO CHANGES TO THE FORECAST IN THIS RANGE.

&&

.MARINE...
MESOSCALE ENHANCED WINDS ACROSS KEYS WATERS HAVE FINALLY RELAXED TO 
AROUND 10 KNOTS. A BIT OF RESIDUAL GUSTINESS PERSISTS...BUT THIS TOO 
SHOULD ABATE THIS MORNING. SURFACE WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS WILL REMAIN 
GENERALLY EAST TO SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...DUE TO A 
PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDING FROM THE ATLANTIC TO THE GULF OF MEXICO. 
THE MAIN THREAT FOR TODAY WILL BE HIGHER WINDS AND LOCALLY ROUGH 
SEAS NEAR STRONGER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP 
TODAY. SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...WINDS MAY BE A BIT MORE VARIABLE 
IN DIRECTION AS THE SURFACE RIDGE IS PUSHED FURTHER SOUTH INTO SOUTH 
FLORIDA AND NEAR THE KEYS. AFTERWARDS...WINDS WILL BE LIGHT OUT OF 
THE EAST.

&&

.AVIATION...
TODAY...ON THE MAINLAND...ABUNDANT MOISTURE AT THE LOWER AND UPPER 
LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...COMBINED WITH AMPLE LIFT GENERATED BY MID 
AND HI LEVEL DISTURBANCES MOVING THROUGH THE SUBTROPICAL JET...AS 
WELL AS THE DAILY SEABREEZE NEAR THE GULF AND ATLANTIC COASTS...WILL 
ALLOW FOR MORE WIDESPREAD DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. ACROSS THE WATER PORTION OF THE 
ROUTE...INCLUDING THE KEYS ISLAND TERMINALS...A MOIST LOWER 
ATMOSPHERE...COMBINED WITH FAVORABLE BACKING SURFACE TO 5000 FOOT 
EAST TO NORTHEAST LOW LEVEL WINDS DURING THE AFTERNOON...WILL ALLOW

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS LOCATED OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE 
SUBTROPICAL JET WINDS AROUND ITS EASTERN PERIPHERY...UP AND OVER A 
CARIBBEAN HIGH CENTERED NEAR PUERTO RICO. LOTS OF ASSOCIATED MID 
AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS ARE STREAMING NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE 
FORECAST. AT THE SURFACE A WEAK PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS EAST TO WEST 
ACROSS FLORIDA. WINDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA HAVE BEEN RUNNING 
MAINLY EASTERLY AT 5 TO 10 MPH. THE EXCEPTION IS NEAR SEVERAL 
CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS FOUND ACROSS THE KEYS AND SURROUNDING WATERS. 
THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED ALONG CLOUDLINES AND 
OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES...IN A CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH 
LITTLE TO NO CAP. DAY TIME HIGHS WERE REACHED BEFORE THE SKIES ONCE 
AGAIN BECAME OVERCAST...WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S.

.FORECAST...
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL DAMPEN OUT BECOMING NEARLY ZONAL...WITH THE SUBTROPICAL 
JET REMAINING OVER OUR AREA BUT WEAKENING. WHILE AT THE SURFACE A 
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MIGRATE SOUTHEASTWARD OFF OF THE SOUTHEAST 
CONUS COAST...REINFORCING THE ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE. WINDS OVER 
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WILL REMAIN EAST TO SOUTHEAST AT AROUND 10 
KNOTS. TONIGHT...OCCASIONALLY CLOUDY SKIES ARE EXPECTED AS THICK MID 
AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS...MIXED IN WITH DEBRIS CLOUDS FROM LOCAL 
CONVECTION REMAIN OVER THE AREA. AT LEAST THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT ABOVE 
CLIMO POPS ARE IN PLACE DUE TO THE ACTIVE SUBTROPICAL JET OVER OUR 
AREA AND AMPLE MOISTURE IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE. THE GFS IS QUITE A 
BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH PRECIPITATION IN THIS PERIOD...HOWEVER 
CONSISTENT WITH THE PAST SEVERAL RUNS...IT IS EXPERIENCING FEEDBACK

.CURRENTLY...
AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS LOCATED OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO...WITH ITS 
EASTERN HALF WINDING UP OVER AN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED NEAR PUERTO 
RICO. LOTS OF CIRRUS EMBEDDED IN THE SUB TROPICAL JET ON THE EASTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE LOW IS STREAMING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AT THE 
SURFACE A WEAK PRESSURE RIDGE STRETCHES EAST TO WEST ACROSS FLORIDA. 
SURFACE WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS ARE RANGING FROM NORTHEAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AT 10 MPH OR LESS. BOTH KEY WEST AND MIAMI MORNING 
SOUNDING INDICATED A CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH A PRETTY 
HEFTY DRY LAYER BETWEEN 950 AND ROUGHLY 700 MB...WITH MOIST 
CONDITIONS BELOW AND ABOVE. CURRENT GPS SENSOR DATA INDICATES THAT 
THE PWAT IS AROUND 1.8 INCHES. TEMPERATURES THIS FAR HAS RISEN INTO 
THE MID 80S...A BIT LOWER FOR AREAS UNDER A BLANKET OF THICK CIRRUS. 
A FEW CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE PERSISTED ACROSS 
KEYS WATERS THIS MORNING...ONE IN THE GULF WATERS OF THE LOWER KEYS 
AND ANOTHER LARGER CLUSTER OFFSHORE OF THE UPPER KEYS.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (THIS AFTERNOON)...
THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO OUR WEST WILL STEADILY WEAKEN OVER THE 
COURSE OF THE DAY. HOWEVER...THERE MAY YET BE A FEW MORE SHORT 
WAVES EMBEDDED IN THE SUB TROPICAL FLOW. PATCHES OF THICK CIRRUS 
WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM OVER THE KEYS TODAY...BUT ENOUGH SUNSHINE IS 
EXPECTED TO GET TEMPERATURES INTO THE MID 80S OR HIGHER ACROSS THE 
ISLAND CHAIN. WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE MOSTLY EASTERLY AT 10 MPH OR 
LESS. THE LOWER TROPOSPHERIC DRY LAYER SHOULD HELP TO INHIBIT THE 
COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE POTENTIAL FOR CU LINE 
ACTIVITY...THE PRESENCE OF A LOT OF SURFACE BOUNDARIES ACROSS OUR 
WATERS...ALONG WITH THE POSITION OF THE SUB TROPICAL JET KEEP POPS 
JUST ABOVE CLIMO.

&&

.MARINE...
WINDS ACROSS MOST MARINE LOCATIONS ARE EASTERLY...IN SPOTS OVER THE 
FLORIDA BAY THEY ARE LIGHT AND VARIABLE. GENERALLY HOWEVER...WINDS 
WILL BE MOSTLY EAST AT 10 KNOTS OR LESS. ALTHOUGH WINDS AND SEAS 
WILL BE HIGHER NEAR STRONGER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. ONLY SUBTLE 
TWEAKS TO THE MARINE FORECAST WILL BE MADE FOR WINDS.

.DISCUSSION...
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS A LARGE...DEEP 
LAYER MEAN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE VIRGIN ISLANDS WITH DEEP 
RIDGING EXTENDING WEST TO SOUTH FLORIDA. GOES-12 MOISTURE CHANNEL 
IMAGERY AND DERIVED WINDS SUGGEST THAT THE CYCLONE THAT HAS BEEN 
SPINNING OVER THE WEST GULF BASIN HAS WEAKENED DURING THE LAST 24 
HOURS...WITH THE UPPER-TROPOSPHERIC PORTION HAVING BEEN SHEARED INTO 
A TROUGH BY WESTERLIES NOSING EQUATORWARD...AND THE LOWER- 
TROPOSPHERIC PORTION HAVING DEGENERATED INTO AN INVERTED TROUGH. A 
CLOSED CIRCULATION STILL EXISTS IN THE MID TROPOSPHERE OVER THE 
CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. MODERATELY STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS STILL 
PREVAIL ALOFT OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND EASTERN GULF 
BASIN...BUT NOT AS STRONG AS INITIALIZED BY BOTH THE GFS AND NAM. 
HOWEVER...ABUNDANT UPPER-LEVEL MOISTURE AND CLOUDINESS PERSISTS IN 
STREAMING NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE YUCATAN AND SOUTH FLORIDA...PERHAPS 
AIDED BY AN ACTIVE EASTERN PACIFIC ITCZ.

THE KEY WEST TUESDAY EVENING SOUNDING REVEALED A MOIST MIXED LAYER 
BUT ONLY A WEAKLY UNSTABLE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...WITH SOME DRY POCKETS 
AND ISOTHERMAL LAYERS EVIDENT BELOW 750MB. DOPPLER RADAR SCANS HAVE 
BEEN VOID OF PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE AREA FOR MOST OF THE EARLY 
MORNING HOURS. HOWEVER...RECENTLY...A FEW SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM 
HAVE POPPED UP OVER THE GULF STREAM OFFSHORE THE UPPER KEYS. SEVERAL 
OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES ARE EVIDENT ACROSS THE SERVICE AREA.

AT THE SURFACE...A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE LIES EAST TO WEST ACROSS 
CENTRAL FLORIDA AND THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. MODERATE BREEZES 
RANGE IN DIRECTION BETWEEN EAST-NORTHEAST AND EAST-SOUTHEAST ACROSS 
THE SERVICE AREA THIS MORNING.

THE FORECAST FOR TODAY IS SOMEWHAT TRICKY. WE HAVE FORECAST A 
6AM-6PM POP OF 40 PERCENT...WHICH IS TWICE THE CLIMATOLOGICAL 
RELATIVE FREQUENCY. MOISTURE NEAR THE SURFACE IS ABUNDANT...BUT DRY 
AIR IN THE 1000-850MB LAYER MAY BE A LIMITING FACTOR. SATELLITE 
SOUNDINGS WERE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN UPSTREAM DURING THE LAST 12 
HOURS...BUT THE ONES I DID ANALYZE SUGGEST THAT LOW-LEVEL DRY AIR IS 
MAINLY NORTH OF 25N AND NOT WIDESPREAD. A WEAK LOW-LEVEL RIDGE 
SHOULD REMAIN JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS TODAY...WHICH WILL PROVIDE A 
FAVORABLE PROFILE FOR ISLAND CUMULUS LINES...PARTICULARLY OVER THE 
LARGER LOWER KEYS...PROVIDED THERE IS SUFFICIENT INSOLATION. 
ALTHOUGH WE EXPECT MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERALL...WE DO ANTICIPATE A 
GREATER NUMBER OF BREAKS WITH SUNSHINE TODAY THAN YESTERDAY. 
PORTIONS OF THE UPPER KEYS MAY GET RAIN THIS MORNING IF THE CELLS 
EAST OF THE UPPER KEYS HOLD TOGETHER AS THEY MOVE WESTWARD.

THE REST OF THE FORECAST REMAINS VIRTUALLY UNCHANGED FROM THE LAST 
FEW CYCLES. WE EXPECT A SLOW RETURN TO CLIMATOLOGICAL POPS BY THE 
END OF THE WEEK...WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR AVERAGE VALUES FOR LATE 
MAY. GFS ENSEMBLE OUTPUT SUGGESTS HIGHER THAN AVERAGE FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE IN THE WIND SPEED FORECAST...WITH PREVAILING SPEEDS 
GENERALLY STAYING BELOW 15KT.  
&&

.MARINE...
NO ADVISORIES...NO HEADLINES. GENTLE TO MODERATE EASTERLY BREEZES 
WILL PREVAIL FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER... 
GUSTY...AND SHIFTING WINDS IN AND NEAR HEAVIER SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE THE PRIMARY MARINE HAZARD WITH 
THE MAIN THREATS LIGHTNING AND LOCALLY HIGH WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS. 
STAY TUNED TO NOAA WEATHER RADIO FOR THE LATEST SHORT TERM 
FORECASTS...MARINE WEATHER STATEMENTS...AND SPECIAL MARINE WARNINGS. 
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY ALONG THE ROUTE FROM MIAMI TO KEY 
WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. ISOLATED MVFR CONDITIONS ARE 
LIKELY ON THE MAINLAND LEG OF THE ROUTE NEAR BOTH COASTS WHERE THE 
SEA BREEZES WILL BE ACTIVE...AND IN THE VICINITY OF THE KEY WEST

TEMPERATURES ALONG THE KEYS ISLAND CHAIN ARE STILL IN THE LOWER 
80S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S SO FAR THIS LATE MAY EVENING. 
THE KEYS SERVICE AREA REMAINS UNDER A THICK LAYER MID AND HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS. RECENT KBYX RADAR IMAGES SHOW A SMALL SHOWER ABOUT 15 MILES 
SOUTH OF BIG PINE KEY...AND LARGE AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN OVER THE 
ATLANTIC WATERS BEYOND 20 MILES SOUTH OF THE KEYS. PULASKI SHOAL 
LIGHT AT DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK...AS WELL AS THE GULF BUOY 50 
MILES NORTH OF KEY WEST AND KEY WEST OBSERVATIONS HAVE BEEN 
REPORTING NORTH WINDS FROM 12 TO 20 KNOTS. MEANWHILE...CMAN AND ASOS 
STATIONS SURROUNDING THE MIDDLE AND UPPER KEYS HAVE BEEN AVERAGING 
NORTHEAST TO EAST WINDS AROUND 10 KNOTS. 

THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING DEPICTED THESE 15 TO 20 KNOT NORTH TO 
NORTHEAST WINDS AT KEY WEST FROM THE SURFACE UP TO 850 MB. IN 
ADDITION...THE SOUNDING ALSO DEPICTED A FAIRLY STABLE LAYER BETWEEN 
4-10K FEET. 
 
.SHORT TERM FORECAST (TONIGHT)...
AT THIS TIME...I WILL MAINTAIN A LOW CHANCE OF RAIN WITH A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT...DUE TO LURKING BOUNDARIES. SKIES 
SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY DUE TO BLOW-OFF FROM EARLIER CUBAN 
CONVECTION. WINDS SHOULD SETTLE FROM THE NORTHEAST TO EAST AROUND 10 
MPH.

UPPER LOW...BENEATH A THICK CANOPY OF MID ALTO-CUMULUS CLOUD AOA 10 
TO 12 KFT...AND A CIRRUS DECK AOA 20 TO 25 KFT.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS 
SITUATED JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS...EXTENDING EAST SOUTHEAST THROUGH 
THE BAHAMAS TO NORTH OF THE NORTHEAST LEEWARD ISLANDS. SOUTH FLORIDA 
AND THE KEYS LIE WITHIN A VERY LIGHT AND WEAK STEERING FLOW...MAINLY 
NORTHEASTERLY. 

.CURRENTLY...CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS REMAIN OVER THE KEYS AND 
ADJOINING WATERS...WITH SCATTERED LOW CLOUDS BETWEEN 2000 AND 3000 
FEET. THE LARGE AMOUNT OF ALTOCUMULUS AND CIRRUS IN THE ATMOSPHERE 
HAS DONE A BETTER JOB TODAY AT INHIBITING CUMULUS/TCU LINE 
CONVECTION TODAY...THAN YESTERDAY. NEVERTHELESS...SOME FORM OF AN 
ACTUAL CUMULUS/TCU LINE HAS STILL TRIED TO FORM OVER THE ISLANDS. 
DESPITE THE CLOUD COVER TEMPERATURES HAVE REACHED THE MID 80S WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S.
 
LIKE YESTERDAY...VORTICITY LOBES IN ASSOCIATION WITH SYNOPTIC SCALE 
LIFT OVER THE WESTERN FLORIDA STRAITS...HAVE RESULTED IN 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING JUST SOUTH OF DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. 
AT PRESENT...THUNDERSTORMS ARE MOVING TOWARDS THE PARK. KEY WEST 
RADAR IS DEPICTING 55 PLUS DBZ HERE...AND WITH STILL ENOUGH LOW

DOWN TO THE SURFACE IN DOWNDRAFTS. AS A RESULT...THERE ARE PRESENTLY 
WARNINGS FOR THE DRY TORTUGAS NATIONAL PARK. ALSO OF 
NOTE...THUNDERSTORMS ARE FIRING ALONG THE NORTH CUBAN COAST ATTM AND 
THESE WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED LATER THIS EVENING. 


.FORECAST...IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...(500 TO 200 MB)...THE 12Z 
GFS AND ECMWF ARE CONSISTENT WITHIN INDICATIONS THAT THE UPPER LOW 
WILL FLATTEN AS ASSOCIATED UPPER DIFFLUENCE GRADUALLY DISSIPATES 
THROUGH TOMORROW. THEREAFTER...A BROAD AREA OF NEUTRAL TO WEAK 
RIDGING WILL CONTINUE FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK ACROSS THE 
GULF...NORTHWEST CARIBBEAN...THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN BAHAMAS...AS 
WELL AS SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS. THE 12 RUN OF THE NAM IS A BIT 
OF A FLY IN THE OINTMENT AND IS SLOWER IN FLATTENING THE UPPER LOW. 
AND REALLY DOES NOT SHOW A MORE ZONAL PATTERN TILL FRIDAY. 

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...WEAK RIDGING 
WILL CONTINUE NEARBY THE KEYS...WITH INDICATIONS THAT THE RIDGE WILL 
BUILD SLIGHTLY ON THURSDAY FROM THE GULF TO ACROSS SOUTH FLORIDA AND 
INTO THE BAHAMAS...MAINTAINING A GENERAL LIGHT TO MODERATE EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST FLOW THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. LATEST 12Z GFS 12 HR POP 
#S FOR TONIGHT ARE STILL QUITE DIFFERENT THAN THE 12Z NAM...WHICH IS 
LOWER. ALL NAM AND GFS 12 HOUR POP #S ARE NOW BETWEEN 15 AND 30 
PERCENT BEGINNING WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT I HAVE ELECTED TO ONLY 
SLOWLY TREND DOWN POPS IN THE IMMEDIATE NEAR TERM. ASSUMING THE 
UPPER LOW DISSIPATES TOMORROW...A MUCH DRIER MID AND UPPER 
ATMOSPHERE COULD RESULT IN LOWER RAIN CHANCES TOMORROW NIGHT. 

FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...12 HR 
EXTENDED GUIDANCE POP #S REMAIN NEAR CLIMO...AND SEE NO REASON TO 
DEVIATE FROM THAT. HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING WILL BE LOCATED NEAR OR 
NORTH OF THE FLORIDA KEYS...WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES OF RAIN. 

&&

.MARINE...TONIGHT...SINCE WE ALREADY HAVE WARNING THIS EVENING...AND 
LOTS OF BOUNDARIES ABOUND...BIGGEST HAZARDS WILL BE HIGHER WIND 
GUSTS AND CLOUD TO WATER LIGHTNING STRIKES. HAVE INCLUDED THAT WINDS

SIDE WILL DO LITTLE TO ENHANCE ADDITIONAL CONVECTION TODAY OVER THE 
KEYS.

IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS(TODAY)...LIKE YESTERDAY...AMPLE 
MOISTURE...BUT LACK OF LOW LEVEL STEERING FLOW...WILL DICTATE THAT 
MESOSCALE BOUNDARY COLLISIONS AND TCU/CUMULUS LINES WILL BE THE MAIN 
SOURCE OF GENERATING RAIN AND THUNDER DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING HOURS. WEAK RIDGING WILL REMAIN JUST NORTH OF THE KEYS. WEAK 
HEAT TROUGHING ON THE MAINLAND WILL ALLOW FOR BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS 
TO BACK TO NORTHEAST DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AS A 
RESULT...THIS WILL AID AND ABET WITH TCU/CUMULUS LINE DEVELOPMENT 
OVER THE LOWER AND MIDDLE KEYS...AND THIS IS DESPITE A MODEST MID 
AND UPPER CLOUD COVER OVER THE KEYS AND ADJOINING WATERS...AS PEAK 
SOLAR INSOLATION OCCURS AT THIS LATITUDE IN ABOUT ONE MONTH. 

LATEST AVAILABLE 12 HOUR GFS GUIDANCE #S ARE STILL JUST ABOVE GOOD 
CHANCE POP #S...AND SEE NO REASON TO DEVIATE FROM ONGOING 50% POPS 
WE HAVE WITH THIS MODEL OUTPUT AND AFOREMENTIONED DISCUSSION OF THE 
TRENDS. NO CHANGES TO ONGOING FORECAST.

.MARINE...MAIN HAZARDS TO BOATERS WILL BE THUNDERSTORMS WHICH WILL 
BE ACCOMPANIED BY DOWNPOURS...WIND GUSTS TO 30 KNOTS...AND 
OCCASIONAL CLOUD TO WATER LIGHTNING STRIKES. IN ADDITION...BOATERS 
IN THE IMMEDIATE NEARSHORE WATERS IMMEDIATELY ADJOINING THE LOWER

FLORIDA KEYS AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE KEY WEST FL
415 AM EDT TUE MAY 23 2006

.DISCUSSION...
AN UPPER-LEVEL COMPOSITE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SHOWS A DEEP LAYER 
MEAN ANTICYCLONE CENTERED OVER THE VIRGIN ISLANDS WITH RIDGING 
EXTENDING WEST AND NORTHWEST OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA. A DEEP 
LAYER COLD-CORE CYCLONE WAS ANALYZED OVER THE WESTERN GULF 
BASIN...WITH CYCLONIC FLOW EXTENDING DOWN NEARLY TO THE SURFACE. THE 
FLORIDA KEYS LIE BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS. RIDGING AND SUBSIDENCE 
DOMINATE BELOW 500MB WITH LAYERED ASCENT ABOVE 500MB. THE RESULT IS 
A SLIGHTLY DISTURBED ATMOSPHERE WITH CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS...BUT 
ONLY WEAK CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY IN THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE...AND A 
PERSISTENT DRY POCKET BELOW 850MB. AT THE SURFACE...A 1018MB HIGH 
PRESSURE CELL WAS CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
SURFACE WINDS WERE MAINLY EAST NEAR 10KT ACROSS THE STRAITS OF 
FLORIDA... EAST 5-10MPH ACROSS THE ISLANDS...AND LIGHT AND VARIABLE 
OVER THE GULF AND BAY WATERS NORTH OF THE ISLANDS. AT 08Z...AIR 
TEMPERATURES WERE STILL HOVERING NEAR 80F AT BOTH ISLAND AND REEF 
STATIONS...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S.

WEATHER THIS WEEK WILL BE TYPICAL OF A LATE SPRING TRANSITION-INTO- 
RAINY SEASON REGIME. WESTERLIES OF MODERATE STRENGTH WILL PREVAIL IN 
THE UPPER TROPOSPHERE...WITH EAST OR SOUTHEAST FLOW GENERALLY 
DOMINATING THE LOW LEVELS...AND MARITIME TROPICAL AIR HERE TO STAY 
AT THE SURFACE. CONDITIONAL INSTABILITY WILL GENERALLY BE WEAK...BUT 
WILL VARY DAY-TO-DAY. POTENTIAL SOURCES OF LOW-LEVEL LIFT WILL 
INCLUDE TYPICAL MESOSCALE LIFTING MECHANISMS SUCH AS THE LOWER KEYS 
CUMULUS LINE AND MAINLAND SOUTH FLORIDA/ANDROS ISLAND/CUBA 
SEA-BREEZE CIRCULATIONS. DEVELOPMENT AND EVOLUTION OF THESE 
CIRCULATIONS AND ANY ASSOCIATED CONVECTION WILL BE HIGHLY SENSITIVE 
TO SPATIAL AND TEMPORAL VARIATIONS OF LOW-LEVEL WIND FLOW AND STATIC 
STABILITY AND THUS QUITE UNPREDICTABLE MORE THAN 6-12 HOURS INTO THE 
FUTURE. THE DEEP CYCLONE OVER THE WEST GULF BASIN WILL LIKELY 
PERSIST IN PROVIDING EPISODES OF SYNOPTIC-SCALE LIFT...MAINLY IN THE 
UPPER TROPOSPHERE...DURING THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...AND WE HAVE 
GONE WITH HIGHER-THAN CLIMO POPS THROUGH MID-WEEK. THE CYCLONE WILL 
EVENTUALLY OPEN UP INTO A TROUGH AND WEAKEN...WITH DEEP-LAYER 
RIDGING STRENGTHENING OVER THE REGION BY THE WEEKEND.
&&

.MARINE...
NO ADVISORIES ARE IN EFFECT OR ANTICIPATED FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS. WINDS SHOULD REMAIN GENERALLY BELOW 15KT OUTSIDE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS. THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE THE PRIMARY WEATHER HAZARD 
TO MARINERS THIS WEEK...WITH THE MAIN THREATS LIGHTNING AND LOCALLY 
GUSTY WINDS AND ROUGH SEAS. ALSO...STEER CLEAR OF WATERSPOUTS... 
WHICH ARE MOST LIKELY TO FORM NEAR THE ISLANDS IN THE AFTERNOONS.
&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TODAY LONG THE ROUTE MIAMI TO KEY 
WEST...AND AT THE ISLAND TERMINALS. EXTENSIVE LAYERED CLOUDS FL120 
ARE LIKELY THROUGH THE DAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE LIKELY THIS 
AFTERNOON ON THE MAINLAND LEG OF THE ROUTE. OTHERWISE CIGS AND VSBYS 
SHOULD BE OKAY.

.CURRENTLY...
A WEAK PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS OVER SOUTH FLORIDA...JOINING TWO HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERS...ONE IN THE GULF AND THE OTHER OVER THE ATLANTIC. 
WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS HAVE BEEN MAINLY EAST AT 5 TO 10 MPH. ALOFT A 
NEARLY CUT OFF UPPER LEVEL LOW CONTINUES TO SPIN OVER THE WESTERN 
GULF. DIFFLUENT FLOW ON ITS EASTERN SEMICIRCLE CONTINUES TO PRODUCE 
A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NORTH OF THE YUCATAN. THE 
DEBRIS CLOUDS ARE STREAMING NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE KEYS. CLOSER TO 
HOME...A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE 
WATERS AROUND THE TORTUGAS...THE GULF WATERS OFF OF MAINLAND 
MONROE...AND A FEW NEAR AND JUST NORTH OF THE ISLAND CHAIN. THESE 
SHOWERS ARE DEVELOPING AS A RESULT OF A MOIST AND UNSTABLE 
ATMOSPHERE. CURRENT GPS SENSOR DATA INDICATES PWAT OVER THE ISLANDS 
ARE JUST OVER 2 INCHES. THEY DAY TIME HIGHS JUST GOT INTO THE MID 
80S. AMPLE CLOUD COVER HELPED TO KEEP TEMPS DOWN...BUT IT DOES FEEL 
MUGGY OUT WITH DEW POINTS IN THE MID 70S.

.FORECAST...
THE UPPER LEVEL CUT OFF LOW WILL CONTINUE TO BE A BUG IN THE LOCAL 
FORECAST. THIS UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL SLOWLY DAMPEN OUT...BECOMING A 
WEAK TROUGH BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MEANWHILE...THE DIFFLUENT FLOW ON 
ITS EASTERN SIDE WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP A BROAD AREA OF UPWARD MOTION 
NEAR THE KEYS THROUGH TOMORROW. MOST OF THE DIFFLUENT AREA NEAR THE 
KEYS IS FURTHER WEST AND NORTHWARD.  HOWEVER...WILL KEEP 50 PERCENT 
CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH TOMORROW...AND EASE OFF AFTERWARDS. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE IN THE MID 80S TOMORROW AS CLOUD COVER 
INHIBITS INSOLATION. ONCE THE LOW DAMPENS OUT...ROUGHLY ZONAL FLOW 
WILL REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST 
PERIOD...WITH THE SUB TROPICAL JET LOCATED NEAR OR JUST SOUTH OF THE 
KEYS. ON THURSDAY A LOWER TROPOSPHERIC HIGH SYSTEM WILL SHIFT 
SOUTHEASTWARD OFF THE CONUS TO JUST NORTH OF THE BAHAMAS. THIS WILL 
HAPPEN AS THE HIGH OVER THE GULF DISSIPATES. THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
CLOUDS SHOULD BE A BIT MORE SPOTTY...ALLOWING ENSUING DAY TIME HIGH 
TEMPERATURES TO BE A LITTLE HIGHER. THE KEYS WILL REMAIN IN A WEAK 
ANTICYCLONIC FLOW THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THIS WEEK. HOWEVER...THE 
CONTINUED MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER WILL KEEP AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
POPS IN FOR THE EXTENDED.

SEEMS TO BE TUESDAY...WHEN THE UPPER LEVEL LOW SPINS SOME ENERGY 
ACROSS THE KEYS.  

.WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...

GULF...EVENTUALLY PUSHING IT NORTH INTO LA ON FRI.  SURFACE FEATURES 
NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE MUCH...KEEPING THE KEYS IN A MOIST AND 
SHALLOW EASTERLY FLOW...WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW IN THE MID AND UPPER 
LEVELS.  THIS SHOULD BRING A CHANCE OF RAIN FOR ALL PERIODS...WITH 
THE PROBABILITY TAPERING OFF AS THE LOW FILLS AND PUSHES NORTH.

WEATHER FEATURE IN THE REGION ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY...BRINGING THE USUAL EASTERLY FLOW AND ISOLATED SHOWERS.

SHOWERS...MAINLY OVER THE EVERGLADES. LOW AND MID-LEVEL MOISTURE 
WILL MOVE IN OVERNIGHT...ALLOWING FOR A BROKEN TO OVERCAST 
MID-DECK...AND THE CONTINUED THREAT OF ISOLATED EMBEDDED SHOWERS. 

OVER THE WATERS...ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL ALLOW FOR 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A CHANCE FOR A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE 60SW

A SURFACE TROUGH IS LAYING ACROSS CUBA FROM THE BAHAMAS TO THE 
WESTERN CARIBBEAN.  FLOW JUST OFF THE SURFACE HAS COME AROUND TO 
THE SOUTH...MEANING WARM ADVECTION OVER THE BOUNDARY IS BRINGING 
ISENTROPIC LIFT TO THE AREA.  THIS WILL CONTINUE TO THICKEN THE LOW 
CLOUDS AND INCREASE THE COVERAGE OF THE ISOLATED SHOWERS CURRENTLY 
FOUND IN THE STRAITS.  SOME POTENTIAL TODAY FOR A CU LINE TO DEVELOP 
ALONG THE MID AND LOWER KEYS...BUT MORNING SOUNDING IS FAIRLY WARM 
IN THE MID LEVELS...WHILE SURFACE HEATING WILL BE LIMITED BY CLOUD 
COVER. 

WINDS ARE NORTHEAST ACROSS MOST STATIONS...BUT THIS IS PRIMARILY DUE 
TO THE LAND BREEZE FROM THE MAINLAND THAT HAS BACKED OUR WINDS THIS 
MORNING.  PULASKI SHOALS IS EASTERLY...WHERE THE LAND BREEZE DID NOT

A WEAK ATLANTIC PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS SOUTH AND CENTRAL 
FLORIDA. WINDS ACROSS THE KEYS HAVE BECOME MAINLY EAST AT 10 TO 15 
MPH. SCATTERED LOW LEVEL CLOUD COVER HAS DIMINISHED THIS PAST 
EVENING...WHILE UPPER LEVEL CLOUD COVER HAS INCREASED. THESE UPPER 
LEVEL CLOUDS ARE IN RESPONSE TO A SHARPENING TROUGH OVER THE GULF. 
THIS EVENINGS SOUNDING INDICATED A THICK DRY STABLE LAYER ABOVE 5 
KFT. BELOW THIS A FAIRLY WELL MIXED AND DRY LAYER PERSISTS. PWAT IS 
AROUND 1 INCH. STEADY EAST WINDS HAVE ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO COME 
DOWN SLOWLY TO THE MID 70S FROM DAY TIME HIGHS IN THE MID 80S.

.SHORT TERM UPDATE (OVERNIGHT)...
EASTERLY WINDS NEAR 10 MPH WILL PERSIST OVERNIGHT THANKS TO THE

.FORECAST...
A FAVORABLE AND LIGHT NORTHEAST TO EAST TRAJECTORY FOR CLOUD LINE
FORMATION WILL BE SEVERELY CONVECTIVELY CHALLENGED BY EXTREME DRY
AIR IN THE LOW AND MID LEVELS. ENOUGH CUMULUS HUMILIS COMBINED WITH
CIRRUS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBTROPICAL JET STREAM WILL PROVIDE

WEST INTERNATIONAL AIRPORT OF 66 DEGREES (THANKS TO RADIATIONAL 
COOLING)...TO 74 DEGREES AT MARATHON. DEWPOINTS HAVE REMAINED AROUND 
60 DEGREES. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES HAVE PREVAILED OVER THE KEYS SERVICE 
AREA OVERNIGHT...HOWEVER INFRARED 3.9U SATELLITE IMAGERY RECENTLY 
DEPICTS CIRRUS INCREASING IN COVERAGE SOUTH AND WEST OF THE KEYS. 
KBYX RADAR REMAINS VOID OF PRECIPITATION ECHOES THIS MORNING. ASOS 
STATIONS AS WELL AS CMAN PLATFORMS HAVE BEEN REPORTING NORTHWEST 
WINDS OF 5 TO 10 KNOTS. 

.FORECAST...

A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM...CENTERED OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO 
EARLY THIS MORNING...WILL LINGER TODAY THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY. AN 
ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BEGINS TO BUILD IN OVER THE KEYS 
SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. RELATIVELY DRY AIR WILL DOMINATE 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...AND AS A RESULT RAIN CHANCES WILL REMAIN 
NEAR ZERO. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL TODAY

SATURDAY NIGHT AS AREA WINDS SHIFT FROM THE NORTH TO EAST.  

SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...

SOUTH FLORIDA THROUGH SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. THEREAFTER...FORECAST 
MODELS DIFFER IN REGARDS TO THE BACKING OF A WEAK TROUGH FROM THE 
BAHAMAS TO THE KEYS SERVICE AREA. THE EXTENDED GFS STILL INDICATES A 
RETURN TO DEEPER MOISTURE TO THE KEYS MONDAY...WHILE THE ECMWF 
BRINGS IN THE MOISTURE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. THERE CONTINUES TO 
BE INCONSISTENCIES WITH LOW LEVEL PRESSURE CENTERS AND MOISTURE ALL 
AROUND SOUTH FLORIDA AND THE KEYS...AS WELL AS THE NORTHWEST 
CARIBBEAN AND SOUTHEAST GULF OF MEXICO. HOWEVER...THIS TROUGH 
APPEARS TO REMAIN STATIONARY OVER THE KEYS THROUGH THURSDAY. 
UPCOMING FORECASTS MAY NEED TO INCREASE RAIN CHANCES FOR THE MONDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY TIME PERIOD. AT THIS TIME...RAIN CHANCES WILL 
REMAIN AROUND 20 PERCENT DUE TO FORECASTER UNCERTAINTY AND MODEL 
INCONSISTENCIES. NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE 
PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...
.CURRENTLY...
KBYX DETECTS NO PRECIPITATION ECHOES. SKIES OVER THE ISLAND CHAIN 
ARE PARTLY CLOUDY. WINDS OVER LAND ARE WEST TO NORTHWEST NEAR 10 
MPH. C-MAN WINDS...ON AVERAGE...ARE NORTHWEST AT 10 TO 15 KNOTS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 70S. ONLY ABOUT FIVE DEGREES OF COOLING 
IS EXPECTED TONIGHT DUE TO GENTLE NORTHWEST SURFACE WINDS OVER WATER 
WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR 80 DEGREES. 

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT)...
IN THE LOW LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL 
BE LOCATED OVER THE BAHAMAS...STRETCHING TO THE SOUTHWEST OVER 
EASTERN CUBA. IN THE MID TO UPPER LEVELS OF THE ATMOSPHERE...A 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR THE FLORIDA PENINSULA WILL BEGIN TO LIFT 
TO THE NORTH TONIGHT. THERE IS NO 00Z KKEY SOUNDING DUE TO GROUND 
EQUIPMENT PROBLEMS. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES SHOULD BE UNDER ONE 
INCH TONIGHT. LACK OF ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE WILL BE RESPONSIBLE FOR 
NO CHANCE OF MEASURABLE RAINFALL TONIGHT. THE CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS
