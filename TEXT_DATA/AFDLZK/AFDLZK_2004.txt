245 PM CST FRI DEC 31 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
COLD FRONT TO THE NORTH IN NORTHERN MISSOURI. THE FRONT WILL NOT 
MOVE SOUTH MUCH DUE TO UPPER FLOW...SO WARM TEMPERATURES WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.

SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT CONTINUES BRINGING WEAK UPPER WAVES INTO THE 
REGION. ISOLATED SHOWERS/SPRINKLES ACROSS THE WEST TODAY...BUT ONLY 
TRACE AMOUNTS. WITH SOUTH WINDS...PORTIONS OF THE WEST WARMED ABOVE 
70 DEGREES.

WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL INTERACT WITH FRONT THE WILL PRETTY MUCH STALL 
TO THE NORTH OF THE STATE. SLIGHT CHANCES OF RAIN TONIGHT...BEFORE A 
STRONGER WAVE MOVES IN NEW YEARS DAY WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.

RAINFALL POTENTIAL INCREASES SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. ARKANSAS REMAINS IN 
WARM AIR AS THE STALLED FRONT MOVES NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. INCREASED 
RAIN CHANCES FOR THIS TIME FRAME...BUT WILL WAIT UNTIL MODELS COME 
TO A BETTER SOLUTION BEFORE MENTIONING HEAVY RAIN.
&&

.LONG TERM....TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
MODELS ON GENERALLY GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE SYNOPTIC SCALE WITH THE 
USUAL DIFFERENCES IN TIMING AND INTENSITY THAT ALWAYS SHOW UP IN THE 
MEDIUM RANGE. WILL BASICALLY FOLLOW THE LEAD OF THE GFS SOLUTION 
THIS AFTERNOON WHICH IS SHOWING BETTER RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY BUT 
ALL MODELS PICKING UP ON A COOLING TREND LATER IN THE PERIOD.

SPLIT FLOW REGIME CONTINUES EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH NORTHERN BRANCH 
KEEPING ALL THE VERY COLD AIR BOTTLED UP TO THE NORTH. SOUTHERN 
STREAM WILL REMAIN ACTIVE WITH SEVERAL SYSTEMS TO DEAL WITH. MODELS 
REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH UPPER RIDGING IN THE EASTERN GULF AND STRONG 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY SLIDING DOWN THE WEST COAST WHICH IN TIME CARVES 
OUT A SIGNIFICANT LOOKING UPPER LOW. RESULTANT UPPER FLOW WILL BE 
FROM THE SOUTHWEST KEEPING TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL TUESDAY. 
WILL CONTINUE HIGH SCATTERED POPS HERE AS WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN 
CONTINUES.

SOUTHEAST CONUS RIDGE MOVES TO THE EAST ALLOWING A COLD FRONT TO 
MOVE THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. WILL CARRY POPS 
UNTIL THE FRONT PASSAGES EARLY WEDNESDAY. WHILE TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
COOLER...AIR MASS BEHIND THE FRONT NOT OVERLY COLD. FLOW ALSO 
REMAINS ZONAL SO NO EXTREME COOL DOWNS EXPECTED. NUMERICAL GUIDANCE 
SHOWING QUITE THE COOL DOWN LATE IN THE PERIOD BUT I AM NOT SOLD 
YET. AFOREMENTIONED UPPER LOW DIGS INTO THE SOUTHWEST CONUS WITH A 
RETURN TO SOUTHWEST FLOW LATE IN THE PERIOD. HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP 
CONDITIONS DRY AFTER FROPA. REMNANTS OF LOW ARRIVE JUST BEYOND THE 
DAY SEVEN PERIOD.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
1015 AM CST FRI DEC 31 2004

.DISCUSSION...
QUICK UPDATE TO TWEAK SKY COVER AND HOURLY TEMP GRIDS. LOW CLOUDS 
WILL HANG IN TODAY...ALTHOUGH A FEW BREAKS WILL BE POSSIBLE. 
SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE...BUT TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY BE A 
COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER THAN THURSDAY...EVEN AFTER THE WARM START 
THIS MORNING. ALL IN ALL...FORECAST IN GOOD SHAPE WITH ONLY MINOR 
CHANGES MADE FOR THIS AFTERNOON.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 315 AM CST FRI DEC 31 2004

MUCH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL BE THE RULE IN THE SHORT TERM. 
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE TO BRING A SERIES OF WEAK H5 
SHORT WAVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS IS 
MUCH MORE GUNG-HO WITH MOISTURE THAN EITHER THE NGM OR ETA...AND 
LOOKS TO BE A LITTLE OVERDONE. WILL USE A COMPROMISE OF THE MODELS. 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR TODAY...THEN INCREASE POPS TO 
30-40 PERCENT OVER THE WEEKEND. MOISTURE WILL SHOW SOME INCREASES BY 
MONDAY...SO WENT WITH GENERALLY 50 PERCENT POPS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA ON MONDAY.

EXTENDED LOOKS TO BE FAIRLY ACTIVE...CHARACTERIZED BY 
STALLING/WOBBLING SURFACE BOUNDARIES AND SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS 
MOVING ACROSS. SURFACE AND UPPER FLOW WILL REMAIN LARGELY OUT OF THE 
SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST RESPECTIVELY...ALLOWING FOR GULF AND PACIFIC 
MOISTURE TO STREAM UP OVER THE MID SOUTH. WITH STRONG H5 RIDGE IN 
PLACE OVER THE SERN PTN OF THE CONUS...ANY SURFACE SYSTEMS TRYING TO 
MOVE THROUGH WILL BE HELD BACK...WOBBLING AROUND THE MID 
SOUTH/SOUTHERN PLAINS FOR SEVERAL DAYS. 

WITH WARM ADVECTION PATTERN REMAINING STRONG OVER THE AREA...
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL FOR EARLY JANUARY. THE OVER 
ABUNDANCE OF CLOUD COVER COULD WREAK HAVOC ON TEMPERATURE 
FORECASTS...SO CONFIDENCE IN THE NUMBERS ISN/T EXACTLY SKY HIGH. 
WITH THIS PATTERN...ONE THING THAT CONCERNS ME IS RAINFALL 
POTENTIAL. DEPENDING ON POSITION OF UPPER RIDGE OVR SERN CONUS AND 
SPEED OF SFC SYSTEMS MOVING INTO THE MIDSOUTH...RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 
1 TO 2 INCHES ARE A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY IN THE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. TIMING THIS FAR OUT IS ALWAYS A 
HEADACHE...BUT IT IS SOMETHING THAT WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED. 

WET PATTERN LOOKS TO FINALLY COME TO AN END ON WEDNESDAY...AS SERN 
RIDGING BREAKS DOWN AND ALLOWS COLD FRONT TO COME ON THROUGH THE 
STATE. STRONG DRY INTRUSION OF CONTINENTAL AIR SHOULD ACT TO CLEAR 
THINGS OUT. HOWEVER...WITH UPPER FLOW STILL REMAINING LARGELY 
ZONAL...DON/T LOOK FOR A SIGNIFICANT COOLDOWN ANY TIME SOON.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY
WARM AIR HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF ACROSS THE AREA AS SOUTHERLY WINDS CONTINUE
AROUND A HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHEAST AND WEAK UPPER 
RIDGING IS OVER THE AREA. A SHORT WAVE MOVING INTO THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO TODAY. THE MAIN EFFECTS WILL BE FAR 
ENOUGH AWAY TO NOT HAVE A SIGNIFICANT EFFECT ON THE WEATHER. AREAS
OF FOG DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT BUT HAVE NOT SUSTAINED THEMSELVES. WILL
MENTION AREAS OF FOG EARLY THIS MORNING. ALSO INCREASED MOISTURE
MAY BE ENOUGH TO SQEEZE OUT SOME DRIZZLE DURING THE MORNING. WITH
THE WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING IN LATER...PUT IN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS FOR THIS AFTERNOON. WILL CONTINUE WITH BASICALLY A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH FRIDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN
SHIFTING TO THE SOUTH ON FRIDAY. ANOTHER SHORT WAVE APPROACHES
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AND MOISTURE MOVES BACKL OVER THE ENTIRE
AREA. CONTINUED CHANCE POPS FROM FRIDAY NIGHT ON AND MENTIONED

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY
WARMER AIR HAS ARRIVED AND SHOULD STAY IN PLACE FOR THE REST OF THE
YEAR AND BEYOND. SURFACE HIGH TO THE SOUTHEAST WILL PROVIDE SOUTH
TO SOUTHWEST WINDS TO THE AREA OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WHILE RIDGING
ALOFT OVER THE AREA WILL HELP DRIVE SHORT WAVES FROM THE WEST TO THE
NORTHEAST AND AWAY FROM THIS AREA. MOISTURE WILL BE INCREASING AND
THIS WILL RESULT IN PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH MUCH LOW
CLOUDINESS...ESPECIALLY LATE AT NIGHT AND IN THE MORNING. THE FIRST
SHORT WAVE COMING OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST NOW LOOKS LIKE IT WILL MOVE 
FARTHER TO THE NORTH THAN THOUGHT EARLIER AND WILL HAVE LESS EFFECT 
ON THIS AREA. LOWERED POPS TO 20 PERCENT FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY 
NIGHT DUE TO THIS. A COLD FRONT MOVES NEAR THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT 
BUT STILL WEAKENS AND WASHES OUT. KEPT A CHANCE OF RAIN IN FOR
FRIDAY IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH BUT DROPPED TO SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE
NORTH WHERE MOISTURE WILL BE LESS. WITH THE UPPER SYSTEM FARTHER
AWAY AND INSTABILITY RATHER LACKING...DROPPED THUNDER FROM THE 
FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY. WENT WITH MAXES IN THE 60S IN MOST AREAS
THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH MINS MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 50S. SOME PARTS OF
THE SOUTH MAY REACH 70 ON THURSDAY ESPECIALLY IF CLOUDS ARE A LITTLE 
THINNER THAN EXPECTED. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
BROAD SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE WITH SEVERAL SHORT WAVES
MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. UPPER PATTERN STILL NOT FAVORABLE FOR A
BLAST OF ARCTIC AIR WHICH THE GFS HAS BEEN TRYING TO BRING IN. THE
GFS HAS BACKED OFF SOMEWHAT WITH A WEAKER HIGH CENTER AND THICKNESSES
ARE A LITTLE HIGHER BUT THAT COULD BE ITS CHRONIC COLD BIAS IN 
EXTENDED PERIODS EASING AS THE TIME DRAWS CLOSER. NOT OVERLY
CONFIDENT ABOUT COLD FRONT THAT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA
LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WHICH LATER RETURNS NORTH AS A WARM FRONT
BY TUESDAY. DID CONTINUE CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE EXTENDED. STAYED
WITH THE LOWER TEMPS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK BUT STILL NOT SURE IT 
COULD COOL DOWN THAT MUCH...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH. DID DROP ALL
MENTION OF WINTER PRECIPITATION AS IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE TOO
WARM EVEN IF A SHALLOW COLD AIR LAYER NEAR THE SURFACE MOVES INTO
NORTHERN ARKANSAS.

MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. UPPER PATTERN STILL NOT FAVORABLE FOR A
BLAST OF ARCTIC AIR WHICH THE GFS HAS BEEN TRYING TO BRING IN. THE
GFS HAS BACKED OFF SOMEWHAT WITH A WEAKER HIGH CENTER AND THICKNESSES
ARE A LITTLE HIGHER BUT THAT COULD BE ITS CHRONIC COLD BIAS IN 
EXTENDED PERIODS EASING AS THE TIME DRAWS CLOSER. NOT OVERLY
CONFIDENT ABOUT COLD FRONT THAT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA
LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WHICH LATER RETURNS NORTH AS A WARM FRONT
BY TUESDAY. DID CONTINUE CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE EXTENDED. STAYED
WITH THE LOWER TEMPS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK BUT STILL NOT SURE IT 
COULD COOL DOWN THAT MUCH...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH. DID DROP ALL
MENTION OF WINTER PRECIPITATION AS IT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE TOO
WARM EVEN IF A SHALLOW COLD AIR LAYER NEAR THE SURFACE MOVES INTO
NORTHERN ARKANSAS.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY
RETURN FLOW SHOULD INCREASE TODAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVES
TO THE EAST. UPPER RIDGING OVER THE AREA SHOULD ALLOW FOR WARMER 
WEATHER AND MAXES MOSTLY INTO THE 50S. WENT A LITTLE ABOVE MAV MOS
AGAIN WHICH HAS TENDED TO BE A LITTLE TOO COOL RECENTLY. MOISTURE
WILL BEGIN INCREASING TONIGHT AND OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 
THE FLOW ALOFT WILL BECOME FROM THE SOUTHWEST AS SHORT WAVES BEGIN 
ROTATING OUT OF THE WEST AND WEAKENING AS THE LIFT TO THE NORTHEAST 
INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THE FIRST 
SUCH SYSTEM WILL BE NEAR ENOUGH TO BRING IN A CHANCE OF RAIN ON 
THURSDAY. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA THURSDAY BUT 
IT WASHES OUT AS IT MOVES INTO THE AREA. THE MOISTURE AXIS STILL
SHUNTS TO THE SOUTH ON FRIDAY BEFORE MOVING BACK NORTH OVER THE 
AREA AHEAD OF THE NEXT SHORT WAVE FROM THE SOUTHWEST. KEPT POPS
AS THEY WERE FOR FRIDAY WITH NO MENTION OF RAIN IN MOST AREAS
AND SMALL POPS IN THE SOUTH. INSTABILITY LOOKS MARGINAL FOR 
THUNDER BUT LEFT MENTION OF THUNDER IN FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON 
THROUGH FRIDAY.

A FEW PLACES REPORTING SOME FOG THIS MORNING WITH TEMPERATURES 
BELOW FREEZING. WILL STICK IN PATCHY FREEZING FOG FOR EARLY THIS
MORNING IN SOME CENTRAL AND EASTERN ZONES.

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
TROFFING ALOFT REMAINS OVER THE WESTERN U.S. THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
OCCASIONAL SHORT WAVES MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. MOISTURE REMAINS
HIGH SO KEPT A CONTINUOUS CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH THE PERIOD. GFS
STILL BRINGING IN AN ARCTIC OUTBREAK EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH A BETTER
THAN 1050 MB HIGH BUT THE UPPER PATTERN IS UNFAVORABLE FOR THIS 
TO OCCUR. THE GFS PATTERN FOR THE END OF THE PERIOD DOES NOT MAKE
MUCH SENSE AND WILL NOT BE DISCOUNTED FOR NOW. DID GO WITH COOL 
DOWN FOR THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK BUT DID NOT GO TOO DRASTIC

HAVE JUST SENT OUT AN UPDATE MAINLY TO CLEAN UP TEMPORAL WORDING. 
WEAK RETURN FLOW ALREADY SETTING UP OVER THE WEST. AS A 
RESULT...TEMPS WILL BE KEPT IN CHECK IN THESE AREAS. EASTERN 
ARKANSAS WILL SEE COLDER TEMPERATURES...WITH RETURN FLOW SETTING UP

BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THE FORECAST LARGELY IS IN GOOD SHAPE WITH NO 
OTHER CHANGES ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME.

ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE SAGGING SOUTHWARD FROM OHIO VALLEY TOWARD 
MID-ATLANTIC REGION OVERNIGHT. CLOCKWISE FLOW AROUND HIGH PRODUCED 
WINDS WITH EASTERLY COMPONENT TODAY...WHICH USUALLY TRANSLATES INTO 
COOL WEATHER THIS TIME OF YEAR. SUCH WAS THE CASE THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH WINDS/SNOW COVER KEEPING PARTS OF NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS IN THE 30S.

OVERNIGHT/TUESDAY...AS HIGH MOVES TOWARD SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES...WINDS IN ARKANSAS WILL GRADUALLY BECOME MORE SOUTHERLY. 
RESULT WILL BE WARMER TEMPERATURES...WITH READINGS TUESDAY AFTERNOON
MOSTLY IN THE 50S.

DEWPOINT SURGE WILL COME ON WEDNESDAY AS GULF BEGINS TO OPEN UP. AS 
MOISTURE LEVELS INCREASE...MORE CLOUDS WILL BE NOTED AND THIS SHOWN 
IN THE GOING FORECAST.

BY MIDWEEK...TROUGH WILL DIG IN THE ROCKIES...WITH A SOUTHWEST WIND 
FLOW ALOFT OVER ARKANSAS. FLOW PRETTY MUCH SPLIT...WITH DOMINANT 
SUBTROPICAL JET AND NO ARCTIC AIR IN THE OFFING. LOOKS SOMEWHAT 
SPRINGLIKE...WITH STORM SYSTEM INTENSIFYING IN THE PLAINS...AND 
DRAGGING A COLD FRONT TOWARD ARKANSAS. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED AHEAD OF THE FRONT LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY.

APPEARS THAT FRONT MAY NOT PUSH ENTIRELY THROUGH STATE...WITH 
UNSETTLED WEATHER CONTINUING INTO THE LONG TERM. 

OVERALL CONFIDENCE FOR THIS PERIOD IS LOWER THAN PREVIOUS LONG TERM 
PERIODS. UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE WESTERN U.S....WITH WEAK RIDGING 
OVER THE SOUTHEAST WILL PROVIDE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. THE AMPLITUDE OF THIS PATTERN THAT DEVELOPS IS A MAJOR 
QUESTION YET TO BE ANSWERED. AT THIS TIME...EXPECT SCATTERED RAIN 
DURING THIS PERIOD...WITH A COOLING TREND.

ROCKIES MOVES EAST AND FLATTENS GRADUALLY BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. LOW OVER 
THE SOUTHWEST DELAYS ITS MOTION WHILE THE RIDGE DE-AMPLIFIES...AND 
THIS WILL DELAY THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION OVER ARKANSAS PAST THE 
SHORT TERM. THE SURFACE PATTERN WILL BE PUNCTUATED BY A RIDGE THAT 
STRENGTHENS THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...KEEPING THE GULF CLOSED. SOME 
WEAKENING OF THE RIDGE TAKES PLACE FROM 12Z TUESDAY INTO 12Z 
WEDNESDAY. RETURN FLOW STARTS TO INCREASE HUMIDITIES DURING THE LAST 
24 HOURS. TEMPERATURES HAVE GONE ABOVE FREEZING ALREADY AT MOST

POINT TEMPERATURES BEING PULLED INTO THE UPPER TEENS TO LOWER 20S. 
WINDS ARE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DEPARTING HIGH AND TEMPERATURES 
WILL ONLY CONTINUE TO WARM OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...GOING FROM 
BELOW NORMAL TO ABOVE. QUICK PEEK AT THE MODELS...FWC DATA AND 
CURRENT TRENDS INDICATE OUR FORECASTED LOWS MAY BE A TAD TOO LOW. 
FORECAST WILL BE UPDATED TO RAISE OVERNIGHT LOWS AND TWEAK THE GRIDS 
TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS. NO MAJOR OVERHAULS EXPECTED.

UPPER LOW THAT DUMPED SNOWFALL OVER DEEP SOUTH TEXAS WILL BE PUSHING 
EAST INTO THE GULF AS THE TROF MOVES EAST OF ARKANSAS TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. UPPER FLOW WILL BE FROM THE NORTHWEST AS RIDGE OVER THE

THE SOUTHWEST DELAYS ITS MOTION WHILE THE RIDGE DE-AMPLIFIES...AND 
THIS WILL DELAY THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION OVER ARKANSAS PAST THE

STRENGTHENS THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...KEEPING THE GULF CLOSED. SOME 
WEAKENING OF THE RIDGE TAKES PLACE FROM 12Z TUESDAY INTO 12Z 
WEDNESDAY. RETURN FLOW STARTS TO INCREASE HUMIDITIES DURING THE LAST 
24 HOURS. TEMPERATURES HAVE GONE ABOVE FREEZING ALREADY AT MOST

.SHORT TERM...
TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
OF MAIN CONCERN THIS EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING ARE HIGH TEMPERATURES 
TODAY AND MINIMUMS TONIGHT. THE LATEST RUC80 MODEL IS THE PREFERRED 
MODEL FOR MY CW AREA TODAY. THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY LOOPS 
REVEAL A FEW HIGH CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE NATURAL STATE AS HIGH PRESSURE 
PREVAILS. THE RESIDUAL SNOW COVER AND PATCHY ICE WILL CONTINUE TO 
PLAY A ROLE IN THE TEMPERATURE TRENDS TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE LATEST 
GFS MOS GUIDANCE IS HOWEVER SHOWING TEMPERATURES ABOUT 4 DEGREES 
HIGHER THAN EARLIER EXPECTED FOR TODAY...TONIGHT AND TOMORROW SO 
WILL RAISE THE ON-GOING FORECAST TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH THE NEW 
THINKING. LITTLE OR NO PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED TODAY THROUGH 
MONDAY NIGHT.           
(38)    
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE
AREA WITH A BIG UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA WHICH SLOWLY MOVES
TO THE EAST AND SETS UP OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. BY THE END OF
NEXT WEEK...ALSO THE END OF THE YEAR. UPPER TROF WILL SET UP OFF 
THE WEST COAST WITH A SHORT WAVE OR TWO TRYING TO MOVE INTO THE
CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY BUT GETTING SHUNTED OFF TO THE 
NORTHEAST BY THE UPPER RIDGE IN THE SOUTHEAST. THIS WILL LEAD TO
A PERIOD OF MILDER THAN NORMAL WEATHER WITH ALMOST UNSEASONABLY WARM
MAXES INTO THE UPPER 50S AND 60S BY THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK WITH
LOWS MOSTLY IN THE 40S. THE HIGH PRESSURE IN THE AREA AT MID WEEK 
SHOULD PRECLUDE ANY CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE
FIRST SHORT WAVE FROM THE WEST MAY GET CLOSE ENOUGH BY THURSDAY
TO INDUCE A GOOD ENOUGH MOISTURE RETURN FOR SOME CHANCE OF RAIN
AND WILL GO WITH SMALL POPS FOR THEN. GFS INDICATES A FRONT 
GETTING CLOSE TO THE AREA BY FRIDAY SO WILL GO WITH A CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THEN. FRONT MAY STALL AND/OR WASH
OUT OVER THE AREA WITH MOISTURE AXIS REMAINING ACROSS THE CWA
FOR A CONTINUED CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BUT THIS IS
BEYOND THE TIME RANGE OF THIS FORECAST.

OVERALL THE FORECAST IS IN GOOD SHAPE BUT WILL STILL NEED TO TWEAK 
TEMPERATURES UPWARDS A FEW DEGREES TONIGHT. ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES OVER THE AREA BUT CENTER OF HIGH IS JUST OFF TO THE EAST. 
WINDS HAVE ALREADY SHIFTED TO LIGHT SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST OVER THE WEST 
AND TEMPERATURES THERE HAVE RISEN SLIGHTLY OR STEADIED OUT. QUICK 
PEAK AT THE MODELS SHOWS A SUBTLE WIND SHIFT LINE REACHING SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS BY MORNING. LATEST FWC GUIDANCE ALSO COMING IN WARMER 
TONIGHT THAN PREVIOUS RUNS SO WILL GO AHEAD AND BOOST TEMPERATURES A 
FEW DEGREES TONIGHT. DIFFERENCE IN FORECASTED LOWS WILL ONLY BE A 
FEW DEGREES BUT ANY THING POSITIVE AT THIS POINT IS WELCOMED. NEW

RAPIDLY BY THE TIME IT GETS TO WESTERN KANSAS. THE CORRESPONDING 
SURFACE PATTERN WILL REMAIN DRY LONGER FROM TUESDAY MORNING THROUGH 
THURSDAY MORNING. RAIN CHANCES WILL INCREASE FROM WEST TO EAST BY 
FRIDAY MORNING. SINCE THE UPPER SYSTEM WILL WEAKEN AS IT GETS CAUGHT 
UP IN THE NORTHERN STREAM...MOISTURE AND POPS WILL LINGER FOR THE 
STATE BEYOND THE PERIOD COVERED BY THIS FORECAST. TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BOUNCE BACK UP TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY FROM THE LACK OF 
CLOUDS/RAIN...AND THE INCREASED SOUTHERLY FETCH TO THE WINDS.

358 AM CST FRI DEC 24 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
OF MAIN CONCERN THIS EARLY MORNING ARE HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY AND 
MINIMUMS TONIGHT. THE LATEST RUC80 MODEL IS THE PREFERRED MODEL AND 
IT STILL SHOWS A WEAK UPPER SHORT WAVE MOVING ACROSS MY CW AREA 
TODAY. THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY LOOPS REVEAL SCATTERED TO BROKEN 
CIRRUS AND A FEW ALTO-CUMULUS ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION. THE 
COMBINATION OF LOW TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING AND SOME WIND WILL 
YIELD LOW WIND CHILLS SO WILL ALLOW THE ON-GOING WIND CHILL ADVISORY 
TO CONTINUE IN EFFECT UNTIL 8 AM THIS FRIDAY MORNING. A WEAK COLD 
FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING ACROSS 
THE AREA TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT. THIS WILL REINFORCE THE COLD AIR 
NOW IN PLACE. THE RESIDUAL SNOW COVER AND PATCHY ICE WILL CONTINUE 
TO PLAY A ROLE IN THE TEMPERATURE TRENDS TODAY...TONIGHT AND INTO 
CHRISTMAS.      
(38)    
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
RATHER STRONG UPPER RIDGE MOVES INTO THE AREA FOR THE FIRST PART
OF THE WEEK WHILE THE ARCTIC HIGH AFFECTING THIS AREA IN THE
SHORT TERM MOVES TO THE EAST AND WARMER AIR RETURNS TO THE AREA.
NEW GFS KEEPS A SURFACE RIDGE IN THE AREA THROUGH NEXT THURSDAY.
ALSO STRONG UPPER LOW STAYS OFF THE WEST COAST THROUGH MUCH OF
THE PERIOD WITH A SHORT WAVE FINALLY MOVING INTO THE PLAINS ABOUT
THURSDAY. THIS SOULTION APPEARS TO BE SLOWER THAN EARLIER RUNS AND
RESULTED IN SOME SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. SURFACE PATTERN FAVORS MORE
OF A SOUTHEAST WIND TO MOST AREAS WITH SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS
IN THE NORTHWEST. ALSO SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. THE SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD BE SET UP
TO KEEP THE GULF CLOSED AND LESSEN THE CHANCE FOR STRATUS. THIS
MAY BREAK DOWN ON WEDNESDAY AND SHOWED INCREASING CLOUDS THEN. 
REALLY LOOKS LIKE ANY CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL 
THURSDAY BUT LEFT SMALL POPS IN FOR TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. AIR WILL STILL BE RATHER STABLE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY 
SO ONLY WENT WITH RAIN FOR NOW. AS THE UPPER SHORT WAVE COMES OUT
THURSDAY AND A STRONG SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS IN RESPONSE...INSTABILITY
WILL LIKELY INCREASE...SO PUT IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

FIELD SHOWING UP QUITE WELL ON VISIBLE PICS OVR MUCH OF NRN AND 
CNTRL AR. AFTN TEMPS HAVE RECOVERED INTO THE 20S AND LOWER 30S.

MAIN FCST CONCERN THRU THE SHORT TERM WL BE TEMPS. MODELS STILL SHOW 
A WEAK UPPER SHRTWV MOVG ACRS THE AREA LATER TNGT AND FRI. ONLY 
LOOKING AT MAINLY MID AND HIGH CLDS WITH THIS FEATURE. EXPECT TEMPS 
TO FALL QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING...BUT FULL EFFECTS OF 
RADIATIONAL COOLING MAY BE HAMPERED SOME BY THE CLOUDS TNGT. COMBO 
OF SINGLE DIGIT TEMPS AND WINDS ARND 10 MPH WILL PRODUCE WIND CHILLS 
IN THE ZERO TO MINUS 10 DEGREE RANGE OVERNIGHT ACRS N-CNTRL AR. HAVE 
ISSUED A WIND CHILL ADVY FOR THOSE AREAS TNGT AND EARLY FRI MRNG.

WEAK CDFNT ASSOCD WITH UPPER SYSTEM IS FCST TO PASS THRU THE FA FRI 
AND EARLY FRI NIGHT WITH A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLDER AIR/SFC HIGH 
PRES BEHIND IT. RESIDUAL SNOW COVER WL CONT TO PLAY A ROLE IN TEMP 
TRENDS INTO SAT.

BY SAT AFTN...HIGH PRES SHIFTS EWD AND A MODERATING TREND BEGINS. 
MOS TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE THRU THIS TIME PD AND HAVE NOT STRAYED TOO 
FAR FROM MODEL OUTPUT. DRY CONDS WL PREVAIL AS WELL WITH GULF 
MOISTURE STILL CUT OFF DURG THE PD.

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
RIDGE TO OUR SOUTH WILL KEEP A ZONAL FLOW ACROSS ARKANSAS THROUGH 
12Z TUESDAY. THEN...THE LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST WILL OPEN UP AND GET 
CLOSER TO ARKANSAS THROUGH 00Z THURSDAY...AND IT WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
ABSORBED BY THE NORTHERN BRANCH OF THE WESTERLIES. THE SURFACE 
REFLECTION OF THE RIDGE WILL YIELD DRY WEATHER THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
ALONG WITH A WARMING TREND SINCE CLOUDS WILL BE FEW AND WE WILL BE 
ON THE RETURN FLOW OF THE SURFACE HIGH TO OUR EAST. MOISTURE WILL BE 
PUSHING NORTH ACROSS TEXAS INTO THE UPPER MID-WEST BY 00Z WEDNESDAY. 
A SURFACE LOW WILL GATHER STRENGTH ON THE LEE SIDE OF THE ROCKIES 
AND IT WILL TIGHTEN THE GRADIENT EARLY ON WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY 
MORNING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE SURFACE 
FRONT WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DRYING WILL COME IN QUICKLY ON

BUILDING INTO THE AREA WITH CLEAR SKIES. LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY 
SHOWED THE CLEARING LINE ALONG I-30 AND HWY 67. SKIES WILL BECOME 
CLEAR IN THE SOUTHEAST EARLY THIS MORNING. MAIN TOPIC NOW IS THE 
COLD TEMPERATURES. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 20 TO 25 DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL TODAY AND TONIGHT. WILL KEEP THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY GOING 
ACROSS PARTS OF NORTH ARKANSAS THIS MORNING AND ADD ANOTHER ROW OF 
COUNTIES TO THE SOUTH OF THE PREVIOUS AREA. SOME WIND CHILLS WILL BE 
0 TO 10 BELOW ZERO THIS MORNING IN THE NORTH. HIGHS TODAY ARE 
EXPECTED IN THE 20S NORTH TO THE LOWER 30S SOUTH. 

A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT AND BRING SOME 
CLOUDS TO THE AREA. WILL NOT INCLUDE ANY PRECIPITATION AS GOOD 
SUBSIDENCE SHOULD BE IN PLACE. WILL ONLY NOTE SOME CLOUDS ACROSS 
MAINLY THE NORTH AND CENTRAL SECTIONS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THIS AND HAVE SHOWN IT THE LAST COUPLE OF RUNS. HIGH PRESSURE 
MOVES EAST OF THE AREA SATURDAY SO WILL START THE WARM UP ON 
SATURDAY AS SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNS. WE REMAIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF

GUIDANCE STILL SUGGESTING A PATTERN CHANGE IN THE LONG TERM...WITH 
ARCTIC AIR SLOWLY ERODING AND A TROUGH DEVELOPING THE WESTERN UNITED

A WARMING TREND WILL RESULT...ESPECIALLY HEADING INTO 
TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY. AT THAT TIME...A RATHER POTENT STORM SYSTEM WILL 
BE TRACKING THROUGH THE PLAINS AND WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT TOWARD 
ARKANSAS. 

RECENT SNOW WILL BE A MEMORY...AS WE GO FROM WINTRY PRECIPITATION TO

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED AT 345 PM CST WED DEC 22 2004
SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT
WINTER STORM HAS MATERIALIZED PRETTY MUCH ON SCHEDULE TODAY ACRS THE 
AREA. HAVE SEEN COLDER AIR WORK INTO AR AT THE SFC AND ALOFT...
ALLOWING PRECIP TO CHANGE OVR TO A WINTRY MIX ACRS MOST AREAS...WITH 
ALL SNOW ACRS WRN AND NRN AR ATTM. MUCH DRIER AIR AT THE SFC HAS 
BEEN WORKING INTO NRN AR TODAY AND THIS MAY CUT DOWN ON SNOW AMOUNTS 
IN THOSE AREAS INTO TNGT.

MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH PRECIP TRENDS. ETA ACTUALLY HAS DONE 
A BETTER JOB WITH PRECIP TRENDS...KEEPING THE BULK OF THE PRECIP 
FURTHER S INTO AR AS COMPARED TO THE GFS. ONE THING THEY AGREE ON IS 
THE PRECIP WL BE ENDING LATER TNGT AND MUCH COLDER AIR WL PERSIST 
INTO LATE THIS WEEK. PLAN TO KEEP HEADLINES IN PLACE INTO TNGT FOR 
THE FA. MAY HAVE TO EXTEND WARNINGS/ADVYS A LITTLE LONGER TNGT...BUT
WL MAKE LAST MINUTE DECISION.

OTHER WINTER WX ITEM TO CONTEND WITH TNGT AND THU MRNG IS WIND CHILL 
READINGS. EXPECT VALUES TO DROP BLO ZERO OVER N-CNTRL AR LATER TNGT 
AND THU MRNG...SO PLAN TO ISSUE AN ADVY WITH THIS FCST PACKAGE.

WITH EXPECTED SNOW COVER AND ARCTIC AIRMASS IN PLACE...HAVE GONE A 
FEW DEGREES BLO MOS TEMPS OVR MOST OF THE FA.
&&

.MID AND LONG TERM...00Z FRIDAY THROUGH 12Z THURSDAY 
MODELS PERSIST ON ABNORMALLY COLD AIR BLASTING INTO THE MID SOUTH 
FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. WITH SNOWSTORM UNFOLDING A BIT SOUTH THAN 
PREVIOUS THOUGHT...SNOW COVER WILL LIKELY EXIST ACROSS THE NORTHEAST 
HALF OF THE CWA. FOR THAT REASON...WENT AHEAD AND BUMPED TEMPS DOWN 
A BIT FOR FRIDAY MORNING. WITH FORECASTED TEMP AND WIND VALUES... 
WILL REALIZE WIND CHILLS AT OR BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA...ZERO 
DEGREES. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR FOR POSSIBLE ISSUANCE OF ADVISORY.

HIGHS ON FRIDAY CONTINUED TO LOOK GOOD...JUST SOME SLIGHT TWEAKING 
MADE. H85 TEMPS REMAIN PERSISTENT WITH -12 TO -16 H85 TEMPS OVER AR 
FRIDAY. WITH FULL SUNSHINE...MIX LAYER WOULD BE ROUGHLY 900 
MB...WHICH WOULD GIVE A MAX TEMP NEAR 20. FUTURE SHIFTS WILL HAVE TO 
WATCH CLOSELY...ESPECIALLY OVER AREAS WITH A FRESH SNOWPACK WHERE 
THE SFC ALBEDO WILL BE QUITE HIGH.

MODELS...SPECIFICALLY GFS...COMING IN RATHER COLD FOR CHRISTMAS 
MORNING...3 AT RUSSELLVILLE...7 AT LITTLE ROCK. BELIEVE THAT TO BE A 
BIT COLD AT THIS TIME. MODELS HINTING AT SOME MOISTURE WORKING DOWN 
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE H5 RIDGE...WHICH MAY GIVE USE A SAFETY 
BLANKET OF CLOUDS EARLY IN THE MORNING. ALSO...TIMING ISSUES MAY 
ARISE WITH HOW FAST THE BULK OF THE COLD AIR WILL BEGIN TO MOVE 
EAST...ALLOWING WAA TO SETUP OVER THE STATE. WENT AHEAD AND LOWERED 
TEMPS JUST A FEW SAT AM...BUT WILL BE TRICKY.

ARCTIC DOME SHIFTS EAST LATE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...ALLOWING THE 
ATMOSPHERE TO GRADUAL WARM FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. MODELS SHOWING 
H5 TROUGH DEEPENING OFF THE WEST COAST OF THE US EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
THIS WILL GIVE OUR AREA FAIRLY DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW. GFS AND DGEX 
INDICATING H85 TEMPS RETURNING TO NEAR +10 EARLY IN THE WEEK.

COLD FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE STATE WEDNESDAY. ADDED 
THUNDER WEDNESDAY DUE TO RATHER WARM AND MOIST SFC LAYER. THIS FAR 
OUT THOUGH...TIMING WILL DEFINITELY BE AN ISSUE. BUT LOOKS LIKE THE 
COLD AIR OVER THE WEEKEND WILL BE REPLACED WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS 
BY EARLY NEXT WEEK.

THE MAIN TOPIC THIS MORNING IS THE WINTER STORM WHICH IS WELL 
UNDERWAY. THE LATEST SURFACE MAP SHOWED AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
CENTERED NEAR GALVESTON TEXAS WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING 
NORTHEAST INTO SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS. MUCH COLDER AIR WAS NORTH OF THIS 
TROUGH. MONTICELLO AND ELDORADO CONTINUE TO BE IN THE WARM SECTOR. 
THE COLD AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA TODAY AND TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE FALLING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE LATEST RADAR IMAGERY SHOWED 
ABUNDANT RAINFALL OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CWA WITH INCREASING 
COVERAGE IN THE SOUTHWEST. 

WILL ISSUE A WINTER STORM WARNING FOR NORTHERN COUNTIES AND A WINTER 
WEATHER ADVISORY FOR PARTS OF CENTRAL ARKANSAS THROUGH 9 PM TONIGHT. 
THE COLD AIR WILL BE SHALLOW INITIALLY AS IT MOVES IN. THIS WILL 
BRING A CHANCE OF FREEZING RAIN BEFORE THE RAIN CHANGES OVER TO 
SNOW. THE LATEST FORECAST SOUNDING SHOWS A WARM LAYER JUST ABOVE THE 
GROUND THROUGH 18Z FOR KLZK. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
PREVIOUS RUNS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM. RAIN WILL CHANGE TO 
SNOW IN THE NORTH EARLY THIS MORNING...AND 18-20Z IN THE LITTLE ROCK 
METRO AREA. 3-5 INCHES OF SNOW ARE EXPECTED IN THE NORTH...1-2 
INCHES IN CENTRAL ARKANSAS... AND LESS THAN AN INCH IN THE SOUTH. 
NORTH WINDS WILL GUST TO 30 MPH ALSO THIS AFTERNOON. WILL GO WITH 
100 PERCENT POPS TODAY...THEN DECREASE POPS THIS EVENING. ALL PRECIP 
SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THE STATE BY 12Z THURSDAY. 

HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY WEATHER MOVES IN FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. COLD 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE THE RULE HOWEVER.

CENTERED NEAR GALVESTON TEXAS WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING 
NORTHEAST INTO SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS. MUCH COLDER AIR WAS NORTH OF THIS 
TROUGH. MONTICELLO AND ELDORADO CONTINUE TO BE IN THE WARM SECTOR. 
THE COLD AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA TODAY AND TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE FALLING THROUGHOUT THE DAY. THE LATEST RADAR IMAGERY SHOWED 
ABUNDANT RAINFALL OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CWA WITH INCREASING 
COVERAGE IN THE SOUTHWEST. 

WILL ISSUE A WINTER STORM WARNING FOR NORTHERN COUNTIES AND A WINTER 
WEATHER ADVISORY FOR PARTS OF CENTRAL ARKANSAS THROUGH 9 PM TONIGHT. 
THE COLD AIR WILL BE SHALLOW INITIALLY AS IT MOVES IN. THIS WILL 
BRING A CHANCE OF FREEZING RAIN BEFORE THE RAIN CHANGES OVER TO 
SNOW. THE LATEST FORECAST SOUNDING SHOWS A WARM LAYER JUST ABOVE THE 
GROUND THROUGH 18Z FOR KLZK. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
PREVIOUS RUNS WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM. RAIN WILL CHANGE TO 
SNOW IN THE NORTH EARLY THIS MORNING...AND 18-20Z IN THE LITTLE ROCK 
METRO AREA. 3-5 INCHES OF SNOW ARE EXPECTED IN THE NORTH...1-2 
INCHES IN CENTRAL ARKANSAS... AND LESS THAN AN INCH IN THE SOUTH. 
NORTH WINDS WILL GUST TO 30 MPH ALSO THIS AFTERNOON. WILL GO WITH 
100 PERCENT POPS TODAY...THEN DECREASE POPS THIS EVENING. ALL PRECIP 
SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THE STATE BY 12Z THURSDAY. 

HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY WEATHER MOVES IN FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. COLD

LIKE WE WILL SEE A RAIN TO SNOW TRANSITION OVER N-CNTRL AR LATE TNGT 
AND OVER TO ALL SNOW WED. SNOW AMOUNTS TNGT LOOK ON THE ORDER OF 1-2 
INCHES...WITHIN ADVY CRITERIA. ELSEHWERE...EXPECT HIGH RAIN CHCS 
WITH EVEN A CHC OF THUNDER OVR SRN AR.

EXPECT THE RAIN TO MIX WITH AND CHANGE OVER TO SNOW CNTRL AR LATE IN 
THE DAY WED AND WED EVENING. KEPT WINTER STORM WATCH IN EFFECT FOR 
WED SOUTH OF ADVY WHERE SNOWFALL TOTALS STILL IN QUESTION. ANOTHER 
UPPER SYSTEM MOVES THRU THE AREA ON WED NIGHT. MODEL SNOW QPF FROM 
THE MESOETA INDCS MORE ACCUMULATION POSSIBLE WED NIGHT.
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
MID WEEK WINTER STORM WILL HAVE DEPARTED THE AREA BY FRIDAY. ARCTIC 
HIGH WILL TAKE OVER IN ITS PLACE. MAJOR CHANGES TO THE LONG TERM 
FORECAST WERE ESSENTIALLY RESTRICTED TO TEMPERATURES OVER THE 
HOLIDAY WEEKEND.

GFS...DGEX...ECMWF AND UKMET ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH COLD AIR 
INFILTRATING THE REGION FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. BY FRIDAY 
MORNING...APPEARS THAT H85 TEMPS WILL BE IN THE -14 TO -16 RANGE 
ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS...-12 TO -10 ACROSS CENTRAL AR...AND -8 TO 
-10 IN THE SOUTH. THERE WILL LIKELY BE SCT CLOUDS FRIDAY AM ACROSS 
NORTHERN 2/3 OF STATE AS MOISTURE ROTATES THROUGH BASE OF H5 TROUGH. 
KEPT SNOW CHANCES OUT FOR NOW...NOT SEEING ENOUGH EVIDENCE TO 
SUGGEST PRECIP AT THIS TIME. WITH SEVERAL INCHES OF SNOW POSSIBLY IN 
PLACE ACROSS THE NORTH...SFC RIDGE IN PLACE...AND LIGHT 
WINDS...TEMPERATURES WILL PLUMMET ACROSS THE NORTH FRIDAY MORNING. 
WENT WITH SINGLE DIGITS ABOVE ZERO ACROSS NORTHERN TIER OF 
COUNTIES...AND TEENS REST OF STATE.

LOWERED HIGH TEMPS FRIDAY TWO CATEGORIES FOR SEVERAL REASONS. 1. LOW 
TEMPS ARE NOW EXPECTED TO BE A BIT LOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED. 
2. CAA REGIME WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE STATE. 3. H85 TEMPS WILL 
REMAIN IN THE MINUS TEENS. EVEN WITH FULL SUNSHINE...HERE AT LITTLE 
ROCK WE/D ONLY MIX OUT TO 900 MB...GIVING A HIGH IN THE LOW TO MID 
20S.

MORE COLD WEATHER CHRISTMAS MORNING. AFTER DISCUSSING WITH SEVERAL 
SURROUNDING OFFICES...FEEL THAT THE SFC RIDGE WILL STILL BE IN THE 
AREA SATURDAY MORNING. WITH CLEAR SKIES EXPECTED...LIGHT WINDS...AND 
THE SNOWPACK STILL IN PLACE...SATURDAY HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BE 
COLDER THAN FRIDAY. HOWEVER...WENT WITH SIMILAR TEMPS TO FRIDAY FOR 
SATURDAY DUE TO SLIGHTLY JILTED CONFIDENCE ON PROGRESSION OF SFC 
HIGH. BUT SITUATION BEARS WATCHING.

WAA WILL KICK BACK IN LATE SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL MAKE A NICE 
REBOUND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCES FOR RAIN IN THE 
FORECAST FOR MONDAY/TUESDAY TIMEFRAME. BOTH GFS AND DGEX SHOWING 
NICE RETURN FLOW ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE HIGH. INTERESTING TO NOTE 
THAT DGEX BRING +12 H85 TEMPS ALL THE WAY INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST 
MONDAY. THAT SEEMS PRETTY HOPEFUL FOR DECEMBER IN MINNESOTA/DAKOTAS. 
BUT WARMER TEMPS AND INCREASING MOISTURE MAKE IT INTO THE MIDSOUTH 
AHEAD OF NEXT SYSTEM. GFS BRINGS COLD FRONT THROUGH THE STATE 
TUESDAY. BUT ALOT OF AMBIGUITIES THAT FAR OUT WITH TIMING AND 
STRENGTH...SO JUST WENT WITH SLIGHT POPS FOR THE MONDAY/TUESDAY 
PERIOD.

400 AM CST TUE DEC 21 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
RUNNING BEHIND THIS MORNING WITH LOTS TO LOOK AT. OF COURSE...THE 
PRIMARY CONCERN IS IMPENDING WINTER STORM ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS 
LATE TONIGHT/WEDNESDAY.

LATEST GUIDANCE IS A LITTLE LESS AGGRESSIVE WITH MOISTURE THAN IN 
PREVIOUS RUNS. APPEARS THAT MAIN MOISTURE WILL GET SHUNTED TO THE 
EAST OVERNIGHT...WITH MOISTURE MOST ABUNDANT ALONG MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER. THERE...IN ADDITION TO RAIN BEING LIKELY THIS EVENING...
LOOKS RATHER CONVECTIVE WITH THUNDER INTRODUCED TO THE FORECAST IN 
ABOUT THE SOUTHEAST HALF OF THE STATE. SYSTEM ALOFT WILL THEN MOVE 
OVER REGION FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WITH ABUNDANT MOISTURE SHOVED 
INTO TENNESSEE/OHIO VALLEYS. 

THIS IS NOT TO SAY THAT THERE WILL NOT BE ANY MOISTURE 
LEFT...BECAUSE THERE WILL BE. JUST NOT AS MUCH AS PREVIOUSLY 
ADVERTISED. WHAT MOISTURE IS THERE WILL CHANGE TO SNOW TONIGHT 
ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS AS AN ARCTIC FRONT PLUNGES TOWARD THE GULF 
COAST. A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW WILL OCCUR IN CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE 
STATE BY MIDDAY WEDNESDAY...WITH SNOW IN THE SOUTH BY WEDNESDAY
EVENING. 

THE PRECIPITATION SHIELD WILL BE NORTH OF DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE 
HEADING FROM EASTERN TEXAS ACROSS THE GULF COAST. SINCE THIS WILL BE 
A RATHER LONG TERM EVENT...LIGHT SNOW IN THE NORTH WILL ACCUMULATE 
OVER TIME. CURRENTLY...CALLING FOR UP TO 5 INCHES IN SOME 
AREAS...ALTHOUGH 2 TO 4 INCHES WILL BE COMMON. MUCH MORE SNOW IN THE 
OFFING TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY WHERE MORE ABUNDANT MOISTURE WILL 
RESIDE.

IN ADDITION TO THE MOISTURE ISSUE...ALSO CONCERNED ABOUT WARM GROUND 
TEMPERATURES. THIS WILL CUT DOWN ON SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
INITIALLY...AND WILL HAVE AN IMPACT ON STORM TOTALS.

ASIDE FROM THIS...GIVEN THE EXPECTED SNOW IN THE NORTH...HAVE 
CONTINUED A WINTER STORM WATCH LATE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY IN AREAS 
NORTH OF CLARKSVILLE AND BATESVILLE.

LIGHT SNOW WILL BE FLYING IN MUCH OF ARKANSAS BY WEDNESDAY EVENING 
AFTER TEMPERATURES FALL THROUGHOUT THE DAY. SNOW WILL EVENTUALLY 
COME TO AN END BEFORE DAWN THURSDAY.

LOOKING AHEAD...LOOKS DRY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. HOWEVER... 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL BELOW NORMAL...WITH THE COLDEST AIR OF THE 
SEASON THUS FAR.  (46)       
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY
UPPER TROUGH IS EAST OF ARKANSAS ON SATURDAY WITH AN UPPER RIDGE 
OVER THE WESTERN U.S. THIS WILL PROVIDE NORTHWEST FLOW OVER ARKANSAS 
FOR A SHORT TIME WITH COLD TEMPERATURES AND HIGH PRESSURE THE RESULT 
AT THE SURFACE. SOUTHWEST FLOW RETURNS ON SUNDAY AND WILL BRING A 
WARM UP TO THE AREA. DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY. MOISTURE INCREASES ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AND A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS IS EXPECTED BY LATE MONDAY AS A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST.

OVERALL UPPER LEVEL PATTERNS WILL BECOME QUITE ENERGETIC DURING THIS

INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS BY LATE WEDNESDAY. STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT 
WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE REGIONBY LATE TUESDAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS

SIGNIFICANT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS.

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY
AFTER A BUSY SHORT TERM...QUIET BUT COLD WEATHER WILL MOVE INTO THE 
STATE FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH SEVERAL FORECAST 
COMPLEXITIES MANAGED TO CREEP INTO THE MIX.

ARCTIC AIR MASS WILL BE MOVING INTO THE STATE AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THE LONG TERM. FEEL THAT GFS MAY BE A BIT OVERZEALOUS BY BRINGING 
H85 -10 ISOTHERM CLEAR TO THE MEXICAN BORDER..SO SOUTHERN EXTENT OF 
COLD AIR IS LIKELY OVER DONE THERE. HOWEVER...BOTH GFS AND DGEX ARE 
BRINGING -12 TO -16 H85 TEMPS TO NORTHERN AR FRIDAY MORNING. WITH 
THE POSSIBILITY OF NORTHERN STRETCHES OF THE STATE HAVING SEVERAL 
INCHES OF SNOW ON THE GROUND...WENT AHEAD AND LOWERED TEMPS A BIT. 
WITH -15C AT 850MB AND SNOW ON THE GROUND...NEAR ZERO WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE. ONLY SAVING GRACE FRIDAY MORNING WOULD BE A CLOUD LAYER 
MOVING IN AS MOISTURE ROTATES THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE H5 TROUGH. 
WAS TEMPTED TO ADD SLIGHT POPS...BUT FEEL THAT THERE WON/T BE ENOUGH 
TO LIFT TO PRECIPITATE ANY MOISTURE OUT.

SATURDAY MORNING COULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY THOUGH. SFC HIGH WILL BE 
CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN MO SATURDAY MORNING. WINDS WILL CALM...SKIES 
WILL BE CLEAR...FRESH SNOW WILL BE ON THE GROUND. ALTHOUGH 8H5 TEMPS 
LOOK TO BE IMPROVING...THE MODELS HAVE A TENDENCY TO SPEED UP THE 
PROGRESSION OF THE SFC HIGHS. SO WHAT AM I SAYING...CHRISTMAS 
MORNING COULD BE QUITE COLD ACROSS ARKANSAS.

HIGH MOVES OFF SUNDAY AND WAA REGIME TAKES HOLD. SOUTHERLY WINDS 
LATE IN THE WEEKEND WILL BRING WARMER AIR/MORE MOISTURE INTO 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS. WARMER AIR MOVING OVER THE SNOW PACK WILL ALLOW 
IT THE SNOW TO QUICKLY MELT. MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER FOG LATE IN THE 
WEEKEND/EARLY IN THE WEEK. BUT ALL OF THAT IS DEPENDENT ON HOW 
MUCH/WHEN/WHERE SNOW FALLS WEDNESDAY. SKIES LOOK TO REMAIN FAIRLY 
CLEAR HEADING THROUGH MONDAY THOUGH...BUT DGEX AND GFS HINTING AND

VERTICAL MOTIONS FIELDS SUPPORT AN AREA OF SNOW ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
NORTH LATE TUESDAY...SPREADING SLOWLY SOUTH ON WEDNESDAY.  
PRECIPITATION WILL DIMINISH FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT.  HAVE ISSUED A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SIGNIFICANT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS.

THANKS FOR EXTRA COORDINATION SGF...PAH...MEG...AND HPC.

&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY
AFTER A BUSY SHORT TERM...QUIET BUT COLD WEATHER WILL MOVE INTO THE 
STATE FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH SEVERAL FORECAST 
COMPLEXITIES MANAGED TO CREEP INTO THE MIX.

ARCTIC AIR MASS WILL BE MOVING INTO THE STATE AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THE LONG TERM. FEEL THAT GFS MAY BE A BIT OVERZEALOUS BY BRINGING 
H85 -10 ISOTHERM CLEAR TO THE MEXICAN BORDER..SO SOUTHERN EXTENT OF 
COLD AIR IS LIKELY OVER DONE THERE. HOWEVER...BOTH GFS AND DGEX ARE 
BRINGING -12 TO -16 H85 TEMPS TO NORTHERN AR FRIDAY MORNING. WITH 
THE POSSIBILITY OF NORTHERN STRETCHES OF THE STATE HAVING SEVERAL 
INCHES OF SNOW ON THE GROUND...WENT AHEAD AND LOWERED TEMPS A BIT. 
WITH -15C AT 850MB AND SNOW ON THE GROUND...NEAR ZERO WOULD BE 
POSSIBLE. ONLY SAVING GRACE FRIDAY MORNING WOULD BE A CLOUD LAYER 
MOVING IN AS MOISTURE ROTATES THROUGH THE BOTTOM OF THE H5 TROUGH. 
WAS TEMPTED TO ADD SLIGHT POPS...BUT FEEL THAT THERE WON/T BE ENOUGH 
TO LIFT TO PRECIPITATE ANY MOISTURE OUT.

SATURDAY MORNING COULD BE A DIFFERENT STORY THOUGH. SFC HIGH WILL BE 
CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN MO SATURDAY MORNING. WINDS WILL CALM...SKIES 
WILL BE CLEAR...FRESH SNOW WILL BE ON THE GROUND. ALTHOUGH 8H5 TEMPS 
LOOK TO BE IMPROVING...THE MODELS HAVE A TENDENCY TO SPEED UP THE 
PROGRESSION OF THE SFC HIGHS. SO WHAT AM I SAYING...CHRISTMAS 
MORNING COULD BE QUITE COLD ACROSS ARKANSAS.

HIGH MOVES OFF SUNDAY AND WAA REGIME TAKES HOLD. SOUTHERLY WINDS LATE 
IN THE WEEKEND WILL BRING WARMER AIR/MORE MOISTURE INTO NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS. WARMER AIR MOVING OVER THE SNOW PACK WILL ALLOW IT THE 
SNOW TO QUICKLY MELT. MAY HAVE TO CONSIDER FOG LATE IN THE 
WEEKEND/EARLY IN THE WEEK. BUT ALL OF THAT IS DEPENDENT ON HOW 
MUCH/WHEN/WHERE SNOW FALLS WEDNESDAY. SKIES LOOK TO REMAIN FAIRLY 
CLEAR HEADING THROUGH MONDAY THOUGH...BUT DGEX AND GFS HINTING AND 
NEXT SYSTEM FOR LATER NEXT WEEK. MORE MOISTURE MAY BE AVAILABLE THIS 
TIME AROUND...WILL HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON IT. (220)

.DISCUSSION...
UPDATE NEEDED THIS MORNING TO TREND GRIDS/ZONES TO CURRENT 
CONDITIONS. NOT A CLOUD IN THE SKY THIS MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY. WINDS HAVE 
COME UP JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE AND WITH GRADIENT ONLY EXPECTED TO 
TIGHTEN THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON...CURRENT LAKE WIND ADVISORY LOOKS 
GOOD. 

TEMPERATURES A BIT PROBLEMATIC WITH AIR MASS SLOW TO WARM AFTER VERY 
CHILLY START. WARMER AIR ALREADY STARTING TO NOSE INTO THE SOUTHWEST 
CORNER OF THE STATE WITH READINGS STILL IN THE 20S STILL OVER THE 
FAR NORTHEAST. HAVE TRENDED TEMPERATURES WARMER FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST FOR THE REMAINDER OF TODAY. OTHER CHANGES INCLUDE 
ADJUSTMENTS TO CLOUD COVER AND DEW POINTS.

ISSUED AT 400 AM CST MON DEC 20 2004
SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT
BUSY SHORT TERM TO SAY THE LEAST. THE HEADLINER WILL BE THE 
POTENTIAL FOR A WINTER STORM TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY. MORE ON THAT 
LATER.

FIRST...A LOOK AT TODAY. ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE WILL HEAD TO THE 
EAST...WITH A STORM SYSTEM JUST BEGINNING TO DEVELOP IN THE HIGH 
PLAINS. BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS...QUITE THE PRESSURE GRADIENT AND 
MORE SO THAN WAS EXPERIENCED ON SUNDAY. GIVEN THAT WINDS WERE FAIRLY 
BREEZY ON SUNDAY...WOULD SURMISE THAT GUSTS WILL BE STRONGER TODAY. 
SO...HAVE POSTED LAKE WIND ADVISORY FOR MOST OF ARKANSAS THROUGH 
THIS AFTERNOON.

TONIGHT/TUESDAY...SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL COME TOGETHER 
MORE. SOUTHERLY WINDS AHEAD OF SYSTEM WILL BRING WARMER CONDITIONS...
WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES TUESDAY AFTERNOON IN THE 50S/60S. SO WHY ARE 
WE MENTIONING WINTER WEATHER DURING THE THE MIDWEEK TIME FRAME?

AS HAS BEEN THE CASE LATELY...THE POLAR JET WILL BRING ANOTHER IN A 
SERIES OF ARCTIC FRONTS FROM THE NORTH LATE TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY. THE 
ODDITY HERE IS THAT THE SUBTROPICAL JET HAS BEEN QUIET FOR AWHILE...
WITH COLD/DRY WEATHER THE NORM. NOT THIS TIME. PLENTY OF ENERGY 
PROVIDED BY THE SUBTROPICAL JET NOT TO MENTION DECENT AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE. STORM SYSTEM IN SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL RAPIDLY STRENGTHEN
BY WEDNESDAY...AND WILL RESIDE ALONG THE CENTRAL GULF COAST. WITH
MOISTURE SURROUNDING THE SYSTEM AND WITH COLD AIR IN PLACE...SNOW
IS IN THE FORECAST.

SNOW WILL BEGIN DEVELOPING IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS TUESDAY NIGHT 
BEFORE SPREADING INTO CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE STATE BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES WILL BE FALLING STATEWIDE DURING THIS 
TIME FRAME. BY WEDNESDAY EVENING...SNOW WILL REMAIN LIKELY IN MOST 
AREAS EXCEPT FOR MAYBE THE SOUTHEAST. IT APPEARS THAT PRECIPITATION 
WILL END LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS THAT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS MAY MEET WARNING 
CRITERIA...WITH PERHAPS 3 OR 4 INCHES IN THE NORTHERN COUNTIES. 
TOWARD CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE STATE...AN INCH OR TWO OF SNOW IS NOT 
OUT OF THE QUESTION. AS IS THE CASE WITH MOST WINTER STORMS AROUND 
HERE...EVERYTHING WILL HINGE ON HOW QUICKLY COLD AIR SPREADS THROUGH 
THE STATE AND HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE. SINCE THIS EVENT 
IS STILL A COUPLE OF DAYS AWAY...CONFIDENCE IS A LITTLE SHAKY.

AFTER THE SYSTEM DEPARTS WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE SHORT TERM WILL
END ON A BITTERLY COLD NOTE ON THURSDAY. (46) 
&&          

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY
UPPER TROUGH FINALLY MOVES EAST OF THE AREA FRIDAY. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE AREA ON FRIDAY AND WILL REMAIN OVER THE 
REGION THROUGH THE CHRISTMAS WEEKEND. EXPECT DRY CONDITIONS THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD. MAIN CONSIDERATION WILL BE COLD TEMPERATURES. 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE IN PLACE WITH LIGHT WINDS ALLOWING 
TEMPERATURES TO DIP DURING THE NIGHTS. FRIDAY NIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS NORTH WITH TEENS IN THE SOUTH. WARMER 
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED SUNDAY AS THE HIGH PRESSURE MOVES EAST AND 
SOUTHWEST FLOW RETURNS TO THE AREA.

CHALLENGING FORECAST TO SAY THE LEAST. COLDER AIR HAS CONTINUED TO

GENERALLY OCCURRED EARLY IN THE DAY...THEN FELL SLOWLY OR HELD 
STEADY. 

VERY COLD NIGHT IN STORE FOR THE AREA TONIGHT. READINGS WILL 
FALL TO NEAR 10 DEGREES IN THE NORTH UPWARDS TO LOWER 20S IN THE 
SOUTH. COULD EVEN SEE A FEW SINGLE DIGITS IN THE FAR NORTHERN 
VALLEYS. A FAIR BREEZE WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT...THUS WIND CHILL

FOR THE NORTHERN TWO TIERS OF COUNTIES FOR TONIGHT AS WIND CHILLS 
FALL INTO THE 0 TO -5 RANGE...AND MAYBE A LITTLE COLDER IN THE 
VALLEYS. 

AFTER A VERY COLD START MONDAY MORNING...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
SHIFT RAPIDLY OFF TO THE EAST AND BRING A RETURN OF BREEZY SOUTHERLY 
WINDS. VERY RAPID WARMUP EXPECTED ON MONDAY WITH AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. SHORT WAVE AHEAD OF MAIN UPPER LEVEL TROF 
WILL BRING SMALL CHANCES OF RAIN TO THE AREA ON TUESDAY. 
TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY WILL BE EVEN WARMER THAN THOSE ON MONDAY 
WITH READINGS 50S AND LOWER 60S. THAT...HOWEVER...WILL BE THE END OF 
THE MILDER READINGS. 

MAIN H5 TROF WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT WITH MUCH 
COLDER AIR MOVING INTO THE STATE FROM THE NORTH. CHANCES FOR SNOW 
WILL INCREASE OVER THE NORTH AS THE NIGHT PROGRESSES. A MIX OF RAIN 
AND SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE CENTRAL SECTIONS...WITH MAINLY 
RAIN IN THE SOUTH. FAIRLY CLASSIC SETUP FOR A GOOD SNOW IN THE NORTH 
INDICATED BY GFS. SNOWFALL TOTALS IN THE NORTH EXPECTED IN THE 1 TO

245 PM CST SUN DEC 19 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT
CHALLENGING FORECAST TO SAY THE LEAST. COLDER AIR HAS CONTINUED TO 
FLOW SOUTHWARD INTO ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON. HIGH TEMPERATURES 
GENERALLY OCCURRED EARLY IN THE DAY...THEN FELL SLOWLY OR HELD 
STEADY. 

VERY COLD NIGHT IN STORE FOR THE AREA TONIGHT. READINGS WILL 
FALL TO NEAR 10 DEGREES IN THE NORTH UPWARDS TO LOWER 20S IN THE 
SOUTH. COULD EVEN SEE A FEW SINGLE DIGITS IN THE FAR NORTHERN 
VALLEYS. A FAIR BREEZE WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT...THUS WIND CHILL 
INDICES WILL ALSO BE QUITE COLD. WILL ISSUE A WIND CHILL ADVISORY 
FOR THE NORTHERN TWO TIERS OF COUNTIES FOR TONIGHT AS WIND CHILLS 
FALL INTO THE 0 TO -5 RANGE...AND MAYBE A LITTLE COLDER IN THE 
VALLEYS. 

AFTER A VERY COLD START MONDAY MORNING...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
SHIFT RAPIDLY OFF TO THE EAST AND BRING A RETURN OF BREEZY SOUTHERLY 
WINDS. VERY RAPID WARMUP EXPECTED ON MONDAY WITH AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. SHORT WAVE AHEAD OF MAIN UPPER LEVEL TROF 
WILL BRING SMALL CHANCES OF RAIN TO THE AREA ON TUESDAY. 
TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY WILL BE EVEN WARMER THAN THOSE ON MONDAY 
WITH READINGS 50S AND LOWER 60S. THAT...HOWEVER...WILL BE THE END OF 
THE MILDER READINGS. 

MAIN H5 TROF WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT WITH MUCH 
COLDER AIR MOVING INTO THE STATE FROM THE NORTH. CHANCES FOR SNOW 
WILL INCREASE OVER THE NORTH AS THE NIGHT PROGRESSES. A MIX OF RAIN 
AND SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE CENTRAL SECTIONS...WITH MAINLY 
RAIN IN THE SOUTH. FAIRLY CLASSIC SETUP FOR A GOOD SNOW IN THE NORTH 
INDICATED BY GFS. SNOWFALL TOTALS IN THE NORTH EXPECTED IN THE 1 TO 
3 INCH RANGE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH POSSIBLY MORE ON THE 
RIDGELINES. PRECIPITATION SHOULD CHANGE OVER TO SNOW ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...
COLD FRONT PUSHING SOUTH OF ARKANSAS THIS MORNING...WITH ANOTHER 
SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR. TEMPERATURES AS A WHOLE WILL BE STEADY OR SLOWLY 
FALLING TODAY...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE STATE. 

WILL BE BREEZY TODAY CENTRAL/EAST BEHIND THE FRONT...WITH WINDS 
SUBSIDING TONIGHT UNDER DOME OF ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE. HIGH WILL 
BRING TEMPERATURES IN THE TEENS TO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS TONIGHT...WITH 
RETURN FLOW IN THE WEST KEEPING TEMPERATURES IN THE 20S.

RETURN FLOW WILL REALLY GET CRANKING ON MONDAY...WITH WINDY AND 
WARMER CONDITIONS. WITH DRY WEATHER CONTINUING...TEMPERATURES WILL 
TOP OUT IN THE 40S/50S. FORECAST TO THIS POINT SOUNDS SIMPLE...BUT 
COMPLEXITY LIES AHEAD.

PATTERN CHANGE SET FOR UPCOMING WEEK...AS HIGH PRESSURE IN THE WEST 
RETROGRADES INTO THE PACIFIC AND TROUGH DEEPENS IN THE ROCKIES. 
STORM SYSTEM WILL BEGIN INTENSIFYING IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS BY EARLY 
TUESDAY...WITH MOISTURE RAPIDLY INCREASING AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT.

INITIALLY...WILL BE TOO WARM FOR ANYTHING BUT RAIN TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON/EVENING. HOWEVER...SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO HEAD EAST 
OVERNIGHT TUESDAY...WITH NORTHERLY WIND BRINGING COLDER 
AIR.

AT THIS TIME...APPEARS THAT RAIN/SNOW MIX WILL OCCUR TUESDAY NIGHT 
IN THE NORTH...WITH THE MIX SPREADING INTO ABOUT THE NORTHWEST HALF 
OF THE STATE ON WEDNESDAY. COULD BE SOME ACCUMULATING SNOW IN PARTS 
OF THE NORTH/WEST...BUT A LITTLE TOO EARLY TO SAY HOW MUCH WITH ANY 
CONFIDENCE. WILL MENTION THAT SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE WILL RESIDE TO 
THE EAST OF ARKANSAS BY WEDNESDAY...SO WOULD THINK THAT ANY SNOW 
WOULD BE LIGHT. 

HEADING INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT...PRECIPITATION WILL COME TO A 
CLOSE...WITH VERY COLD AIR LEFT BEHIND TO START THE LONG TERM.

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH CONTINUES ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY. UPPER RIDGE 
CONTINUES ALONG WEST COAST OF THE U.S. GFS IS PRETTY CONSISTENT WITH 
THE UPPER TROUGH. SEVERAL SHORT WAVES WILL ROTATE AROUND THIS TROUGH 
AND BRING SMALL CHANCES OF LIGHT SNOW TO THE AREA. WILL INCLUDE 
SLIGHT CHANCES THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING. GFS IS A 
LITTLE FASTER WITH THIS SYSTEM THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. PRECIP SHOULD BE 
EAST OF AREA BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FOR 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AND WILL NOT EXPECT ANY PRECIPITATION 
DURING THIS TIME. 

TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLD DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD. LOW

.DISCUSSION...
COLD FRONT HAS MOVED OUT OF THE STATE. ONLY EFFECT FROM IT IS LOWER 
DEW POINTS AND AN INCREASE IN NORTHWEST WIND. THE BLAST OF ARCTIC
AIR IS STILL TO THE NORTH AND SHOWED UP WELL ON UPPER CHARTS THIS
EVENING WITH ARKANSAS ABOUT AT THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROF. EXPECT
THE ARCTIC AIR TO INVADE THE STATE LATER TONIGHT. UPDATED GRIDS 
TO RAISE TEMPS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS TO FIT OBS CLOSER. STILL
LOOK FOR BIG RALLY IN TEMPS IN THE NORTH LATER. LEFT CHANCE OF
FLURRIES IN THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST BUT DELAYED ONSET UNTIL 09Z
OR LATER THEN CONTINUED FLURRIES INTO MID MORNING. LOWERED DEW POINTS
SOME FOR REST OF TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING BASED ON OBSERVED DATA. 
ALSO ALTERED SKY COVER TO FIT OBS A LITTLE BETTER. SENT OUT ZONE 
UPDATE WITH SOME MINS RAISED FOR TONIGHT ESPECIALLY IN SOUTH AND
MENTIONED FLURRIES LATE OR TOWARD MORNING.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 235 PM CST SAT DEC 18 2004 

.SYNOPSIS...
COMPLICATED FORECAST SITUATION CONTINUES. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL 
CONTINUE TO SEND SYSTEMS THROUGH THE AREA FOR MUCH OF THE SHORT 
TERM. BY MID WEEK...UPPER TROUGH WILL DEEPEN IN THE WEST...WITH 
SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE RETURN NOTED. WITH COLLISION OF COLD AIR FROM 
THE NORTHWEST...AND MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND WEST...AREA 
HEADING FOR A PROLONGED PERIOD OF ACTIVE WEATHER. MY APOLOGIES FOR 
BEING SO VERBOSE...

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT

THROUGH TONIGHT...COLD FRONT SHOWING UP RATHER NICELY ON SATELLITE 
AND WSR-88D...OVER NRN AND WRN ARKANSAS /JBR-SRC-MEZ/. SYSTEM WILL 
CONTINUE HEADING THROUGH THE AREA...CLEARING OUT LATE TONIGHT. TEMPS 
WILL FALL SHARPLY WITH THE SUNSET...AND PASSAGE OF THE FRONT. SOME 
FLURRIES WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER NORTHEASTERN ARKANSAS LATE TONIGHT. 
HOWEVER...NOT MUCH MOISTURE NOTED OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE 
AREA...SO ONLY SOME AC AND CIRRUS WILL BE NOTED. 

.SUNDAY...SURFACE RIDGE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA IN THE NORTHWEST 
FLOW. VERY COLD TEMPERATURES WILL BE NOTED OVER A LARGE PORTION OF 
THE AREA. POSITION OF THE RIDGE AND RESUMPTION OF RETURN FLOW WILL 
PLAY A LARGE PART IN TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY. APPEARS TO BE A VERY 
SHARP SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST GRADIENT...WITH DIURNAL MAXES VARYING 
AS MUCH AS 20 DEGREES FROM SW TO NE. THUS...SERIOUS TEMPERATURE BUST 
POTENTIAL IS A HAZARD FOR SUNDAY. 

.SUNDAY NIGHT...RETURN FLOW WILL SET UP OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS ON 
SUNDAY NIGHT...AS SURFACE RIDGE HEADS SOUTHEAST. LOCATIONS IN THE 
WEST ARE LIKELY TO SEE MINS IN THE MID TO LATE EVENING TIME 
FRAME...BEFORE STEADYING OUT AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND POSSIBLY BEGINNING 
A SLOW RISE JUST BEFORE DAWN. DON/T GET ME WRONG THOUGH. ITS STILL 
GOING TO BE COLD. 

.MONDAY...RAPID TEMPERATURE RECOVERY WILL BE THE PRIMARY ISSUE ON 
MONDAY. RIGHT NOW...LOOKS AS THOUGH HIGHS COULD TOP OUT IN THE MID 
40S NORTHEAST TO THE MID 50S SOUTHWEST. ONE THING THAT MAY THROW A 
WRENCH INTO THESE NUMBERS IS WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION. IF WINDS CAN 
GO COMPLETELY SOUTH BY MID DAY...COULD BE A LITTLE WARMER THAN 
EXPECTED. AS THE RIDGE EXITS...AND NEXT SYSTEM DEVELOPS OUT IN THE 
PLAINS...GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN UP...PRODUCING BREEZY CONDITIONS ON 
MONDAY AFTERNOON. 

.MONDAY NIGHT...MOISTURE WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST 
ON MONDAY NIGHT..AS YET ANOTHER IN A CONTINUING SERIES OF SURFACE 
FRONTS MOVES INTO NORTHERN ARKANSAS. LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE COULD BE 
A CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN...MIXING WITH FLURRIES TOWARD TUESDAY 
MORNING...AS ISENTROPIC UPLIFT SETS UP OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS BEHIND 
THE FRONT...AND SURFACE TEMPS FALL BELOW FREEZING.

.TUESDAY...THIS WILL BE ANOTHER DAY WHERE TEMPERATURE TRENDS WILL BE 
HARD TO PIN DOWN. WITH FRONT EXPECTED TO BE SW-NE ORIENTED OVER MID-
CWA...AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER...MAXES IN THE NORTHWEST AND WEST 
ARE LIKELY TO BE REACHED TOWARD MID DAY...AND IN THE REMAINDER OF 
THE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON. THEN...TEMPS EXPECTED TO BEGIN FALLING 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON. 

.TUESDAY NIGHT...WHILE MUCH OF THE AREA WILL STAY IN THE MID 30S TO 
LOWER 40S...NORTHERN ARKANSAS WILL FALL BACK DOWN INTO THE UPPER 
20S/LOWER 30S. SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THESE AREAS...WITH RAIN 
POSSIBLY MIXING WITH SNOW IN THE ARKANSAS RIVER VALLEY...EXTENDING  
TOWARD CROWLEY/S RIDGE. EVERYONE ELSE GETS RAIN. 
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
LATEST GFS RUN IS FASTER WITH WINTER TYPE PRECIPITATION DURING THE 
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. SURFACE LOW JUST SOUTHEAST OF ARKANSAS IS 
FARTHER EAST AND MOVES AWAY FASTER THAN PREVIOUS MODEL RUN. THINK 
THAT IT MAY BE A LITTLE FAST ON MOVEMENT NORTHEASTWARD...SO HAVE 
PRETTY MUCH LEFT WEDNESDAY WITH WHAT WAS PREVIOUSLY FORECAST. MAINLY 
CHANCE OF RAIN OR SNOW NORTH...AND CHANCE OF RAIN SOUTH. COLD 
CANADIAN AIR WILL REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. NEXT 
SHORT WAVE AFFECTS THE AREA WITH SMALL CHANCES OF SNOW THURSDAY 
NIGHT...FRIDAY MORNING TIME FRAME.

SHARP SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST GRADIENT...WITH DIURNAL MAXES VARYING 
AS MUCH AS 20 DEGREES FROM SW TO NE. THUS...SERIOUS TEMPERATURE BUST 
POTENTIAL IS A HAZARD FOR SUNDAY. 

.SUNDAY NIGHT...RETURN FLOW WILL SET UP OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS ON 
SUNDAY NIGHT...AS SURFACE RIDGE HEADS SOUTHEAST. LOCATIONS IN THE 
WEST ARE LIKELY TO SEE MINS IN THE MID TO LATE EVENING TIME 
FRAME...BEFORE STEADYING OUT AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND POSSIBLY BEGINNING 
A SLOW RISE JUST BEFORE DAWN. DON/T GET ME WRONG THOUGH. ITS STILL 
GOING TO BE COLD. 

.MONDAY...RAPID TEMPERATURE RECOVERY WILL BE THE PRIMARY ISSUE ON 
MONDAY. RIGHT NOW...LOOKS AS THOUGH HIGHS COULD TOP OUT IN THE MID 
40S NORTHEAST TO THE MID 50S SOUTHWEST. ONE THING THAT MAY THROW A 
WRENCH INTO THESE NUMBERS IS WIND SPEED AND DIRECTION. IF WINDS CAN 
GO COMPLETELY SOUTH BY MID DAY...COULD BE A LITTLE WARMER THAN 
EXPECTED. AS THE RIDGE EXITS...AND NEXT SYSTEM DEVELOPS OUT IN THE 
PLAINS...GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN UP...PRODUCING BREEZY CONDITIONS ON 
MONDAY AFTERNOON. 

.MONDAY NIGHT...MOISTURE WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST 
ON MONDAY NIGHT..AS YET ANOTHER IN A CONTINUING SERIES OF SURFACE 
FRONTS MOVES INTO NORTHERN ARKANSAS. LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE COULD BE 
A CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN...MIXING WITH FLURRIES TOWARD TUESDAY 
MORNING...AS ISENTROPIC UPLIFT SETS UP OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS BEHIND 
THE FRONT...AND SURFACE TEMPS FALL BELOW FREEZING.

.TUESDAY...THIS WILL BE ANOTHER DAY WHERE TEMPERATURE TRENDS WILL BE 
HARD TO PIN DOWN. WITH FRONT EXPECTED TO BE SW-NE ORIENTED OVER MID-
CWA...AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER...MAXES IN THE NORTHWEST AND WEST 
ARE LIKELY TO BE REACHED TOWARD MID DAY...AND IN THE REMAINDER OF 
THE AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON. THEN...TEMPS EXPECTED TO BEGIN FALLING 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON. 

.TUESDAY NIGHT...WHILE MUCH OF THE AREA WILL STAY IN THE MID 30S TO 
LOWER 40S...NORTHERN ARKANSAS WILL FALL BACK DOWN INTO THE UPPER

PERSISTENT LARGE RIDGE IN THE WEST CONTINUES TO KEEP UPPER FLOW OUT

TOWARD ARKANSAS. 

NEXT ARCTIC FRONT SET TO ARRIVE LATER TODAY/TONIGHT...WITH MUCH 
COLDER AIR TO FOLLOW. AHEAD OF FRONT...QUITE A WARMUP IN STORE THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES IN THE FORECAST. READINGS

30S/40S...AND A FEW 50S IN THE SOUTHWEST. OTHER THAN A FEW FLURRIES 
EARLY IN THE NORTHEAST...HARDLY ANY MOISTURE SURROUNDING FRONT TO 
MENTION PRECIPITATION.

AS OF LATE...SUBTROPICAL JET HAS GONE INTO HIBERNATION...WITH NEAR 
RECORD RAINFALL IN OCTOBER/NOVEMBER REPLACED WITH ABNORMALLY DRY 
WEATHER THIS MONTH. THIS WILL CHANGE A BIT TOWARD THE END OF THE 
SHORT TERM. RIDGE IN THE WEST WILL RETROGRADE/WEAKEN SOMEWHAT BY 
TUESDAY...WITH TROUGH DEEPENING IN THE ROCKIES. APPEARS THAT STORM 
SYSTEM WILL START DEVELOPING IN THE PLAINS...AND WILL GET CRANKED UP 
AS IT HEADS EAST OF THE REGION BY MIDWEEK.

AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM...MOISTURE JUST BEGINNING TO LOOK APPRECIABLE... 
WITH CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN/LIGHT SNOW IN THE FORECAST TUESDAY/TUESDAY 
NIGHT. MOISTURE BECOMES MUCH MORE ABUNDANT IN THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES...SO PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS AROUND HERE NOTHING TO WRITE HOME

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DIGS INTO THE NATIONS MID SECTION ON

TEMPERATURES WILL LAST THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. DRY AIR MOVES IN 
FOR THURSDAY BUT A SHORT WAVE MAKES ITS WAY ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
955 PM CST FRI DEC 17 2004

DISCUSSION...TEMPS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE LOWER 30S IN SOME OF THE
USUAL COOL SPOTS IN THE ARKANSAS RIVER VALLEY AND SOUTHEAST. SOME
LIGHT SOUTHWEST WINDS HAVE DEVELOPED WHICH MAY CURB MUCH MORE 
DECREASE IN TEMPS BUT WINDS ARE CALM ACROSS MOST OF THE SOUTH. 
UPDATED TO LOWER MINS A LITTLE IN THE ARKANSAS RIVER VALLEY AND
PARTS OF THE WEST AS WELL AS THE SOUTHEAST. ALSO SET WINDS TO 
CALM IN THE SOUTH FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT WITH SOME INCREASE TOWARD 
MORNING. REST OF FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK. 
&&
29

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 258 PM CST FRI DEC 17 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT

.TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY WHICH IS BARELY A WIND SHIFT LINE IS CURRENTLY 
OVER SOUTHERN MISSOURI...HEADING SOUTHWARD TOWARD NORTHERN ARKANSAS. 
SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH TONIGHT...FOLLOWED BY A WEAK COLD FRONT ON 
SATURDAY. THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY TEMPERATURE FALLS DURING THE 
AFTERNOON IN NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT. 
GRADIENT WILL PICK UP BEHIND THE FRONT. WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY...WITH 
DECENT WINDS DURING THE NIGHT...AND THIS SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES 
FROM COMPLETELY BOTTOMING OUT. HOWEVER...WIND CHILL WILL BE A 
FACTOR...AS INDICES COULD DIP DOWN INTO THE TEENS IN NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS. 

WHILE MOISTURE ISN/T OVERLY ABUNDANT...UPPER SUPPORT IS CERTAINLY 
PRESENT. HAVE CONTINUED TO INCLUDE A CHANCE OF SPRINKLES/FLURRIES AS 
THE SYSTEM SWINGS ACROSS. 

.SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...
SURFACE RIDGE WILL SWEEP ACROSS ON SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STILL 
BE RATHER COLD...WITH HIGHS TOPPING OUT IN THE LOWER 30S 
NORTHEAST...TO THE MID 40S/UPPER 40S SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH. AS THE 
HIGH SLIDES EAST EARLY SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH WARM ADVECTION SETTING 
UP. TEMPERATURES IN WESTERN ARKANSAS COULD VERY WELL REACH THEIR 
MINIMUMS BEFORE MIDNIGHT...STEADYING OUT OR SLOWLY RISING TOWARD 
DAWN. 

.MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...
COLD FRONT AND DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW WILL APPROACH NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS ON MONDAY. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE...WITH LIGHT RAIN 
BECOMING POSSIBLE LATE MONDAY NIGHT. THE RAIN MAY MIX WITH SNOW 
TOWARD MORNING...PARTICULARLY OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS. (57)
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
COMPLEX SITUATION CONTINUES THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK LEADING UP TO 
CHRISTMAS. SEVERAL SHORT WAVES RIDE ALONG NORTHWEST FLOW... 
AMPLIFYING THE H5 POLAR VORTEX. BY MID WEEK...DEEP TROUGH CARVING 
OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST U.S...WITH SOUTHERN JET OVERTAKING THE NORTHERN 
BRANCH. THIS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO A DECENT STORM MID/LATE NEXT WEEK 
SOMEWHERE IN THE EASTERN US...BUT MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT 
THE MAIN SYSTEM WILL COME TOGETHER WELL EAST OF OUR AREA OF CONCERN.

.MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
HOWEVER...THAT DOES NOT MEAN ARKANSAS WILL HAVE BORING WEATHER FOR 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD. INTRODUCED POPS TUESDAY...AND CARRIED THEM 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING. SURFACE LOW WILL DROP OUT OF OKLAHOMA 
TUESDAY...AND SWING THROUGH SOUTHERN ARKANSAS LATE TUESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. 295K ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS SHOWS PLENTY OF LIFT AHEAD OF 
THE SYSTEM. LOW LEVELS WILL SATURATE RATHER EASILY...LEADING TO RAIN 
AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. BEHIND THE SYSTEM WEDNESDAY...ANOTHER SHOT OF 
SATURATED AIR WILL RIDE ANOTHER PUSH OF WARM AIR ADVECTION FROM 
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. LOOKING AT TEMPERATURE FIELDS... 
BELIEVE THAT COLUMN WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR AN ALL SNOW EVENT 
NORTH...AND RAIN OR SNOW CENTRAL AND MAYBE SOUTH. SNOW AMOUNTS WOULD 
BE LIGHT AS MOISTURE PATCH PUSHES THROUGH THE STATE QUICKLY.

.THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...
QUIET WEATHER THURSDAY BEFORE THE NEXT SYSTEM ARRIVES FRIDAY. 
TAPERED BACK POPS ON FRIDAY. COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE STATE 
DURING THE DAY. TIMING WILL BE AN ISSUE...OPTED TO BRING THE FRONT 
THROUGH EARLY IN THE DAY...WHICH KEPT HIGHS ON FRIDAY COOL. BROUGHT 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SNOW ALONG WITH THE FRONT...MAINLY CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE STATE. MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED THOUGH...AS 
THETA ANALYSIS SHOWS THE LOW LEVELS NOT QUITE SATURATING. HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVES IN EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING. H85 TEMPS DROP INTO THE 
MINUS TEENS...EQUATING TO NEAR 10 IN THE NORTH TO NEAR 20 ACROSS THE 
REST OF THE STATE. (22/220)

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
955 PM CST FRI DEC 17 2004

DISCUSSION...TEMPS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE LOWER 30S IN SOME OF THE
USUAL COOL SPOTS IN THE ARKANSAS RIVER VALLEY AND SOUTHEAST. SOME
LIGHT SOUTHWEST WINDS HAVE DEVELOPED WHICH MAY CURB MUCH MORE 
DECREASE IN TEMPS BUT WINDS ARE CALM ACROSS MOST OF THE SOUTH. 
UPDATED TO LOWER MINS A LITTLE IN THE ARKANSAS RIVER VALLEY AND
PARTS OF THE WEST AS WELL AS THE SOUTHEAST. ALSO SET WINDS TO 
CALM IN THE SOUTH FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT WITH SOME INCREASE TOWARD 
MORNING. REST OF FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 258 PM CST FRI DEC 17 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT

.TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY WHICH IS BARELY A WIND SHIFT LINE IS CURRENTLY 
OVER SOUTHERN MISSOURI...HEADING SOUTHWARD TOWARD NORTHERN ARKANSAS. 
SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH TONIGHT...FOLLOWED BY A WEAK COLD FRONT ON 
SATURDAY. THIS WILL BE FOLLOWED BY TEMPERATURE FALLS DURING THE 
AFTERNOON IN NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT. 
GRADIENT WILL PICK UP BEHIND THE FRONT. WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY...WITH 
DECENT WINDS DURING THE NIGHT...AND THIS SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES 
FROM COMPLETELY BOTTOMING OUT. HOWEVER...WIND CHILL WILL BE A 
FACTOR...AS INDICES COULD DIP DOWN INTO THE TEENS IN NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS. 

WHILE MOISTURE ISN/T OVERLY ABUNDANT...UPPER SUPPORT IS CERTAINLY 
PRESENT. HAVE CONTINUED TO INCLUDE A CHANCE OF SPRINKLES/FLURRIES AS 
THE SYSTEM SWINGS ACROSS. 

.SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...
SURFACE RIDGE WILL SWEEP ACROSS ON SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STILL 
BE RATHER COLD...WITH HIGHS TOPPING OUT IN THE LOWER 30S 
NORTHEAST...TO THE MID 40S/UPPER 40S SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH. AS THE 
HIGH SLIDES EAST EARLY SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH WARM ADVECTION SETTING 
UP. TEMPERATURES IN WESTERN ARKANSAS COULD VERY WELL REACH THEIR 
MINIMUMS BEFORE MIDNIGHT...STEADYING OUT OR SLOWLY RISING TOWARD 
DAWN. 

.MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...
COLD FRONT AND DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW WILL APPROACH NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS ON MONDAY. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE...WITH LIGHT RAIN 
BECOMING POSSIBLE LATE MONDAY NIGHT. THE RAIN MAY MIX WITH SNOW 
TOWARD MORNING...PARTICULARLY OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS. (57)
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
COMPLEX SITUATION CONTINUES THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK LEADING UP TO 
CHRISTMAS. SEVERAL SHORT WAVES RIDE ALONG NORTHWEST FLOW... 
AMPLIFYING THE H5 POLAR VORTEX. BY MID WEEK...DEEP TROUGH CARVING 
OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST U.S...WITH SOUTHERN JET OVERTAKING THE NORTHERN 
BRANCH. THIS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO A DECENT STORM MID/LATE NEXT WEEK 
SOMEWHERE IN THE EASTERN US...BUT MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT 
THE MAIN SYSTEM WILL COME TOGETHER WELL EAST OF OUR AREA OF CONCERN.

.MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
HOWEVER...THAT DOES NOT MEAN ARKANSAS WILL HAVE BORING WEATHER FOR 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD. INTRODUCED POPS TUESDAY...AND CARRIED THEM 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING. SURFACE LOW WILL DROP OUT OF OKLAHOMA 
TUESDAY...AND SWING THROUGH SOUTHERN ARKANSAS LATE TUESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. 295K ISENTROPIC ANALYSIS SHOWS PLENTY OF LIFT AHEAD OF 
THE SYSTEM. LOW LEVELS WILL SATURATE RATHER EASILY...LEADING TO RAIN 
AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. BEHIND THE SYSTEM WEDNESDAY...ANOTHER SHOT OF 
SATURATED AIR WILL RIDE ANOTHER PUSH OF WARM AIR ADVECTION FROM 
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. LOOKING AT TEMPERATURE FIELDS... 
BELIEVE THAT COLUMN WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR AN ALL SNOW EVENT 
NORTH...AND RAIN OR SNOW CENTRAL AND MAYBE SOUTH. SNOW AMOUNTS WOULD 
BE LIGHT AS MOISTURE PATCH PUSHES THROUGH THE STATE QUICKLY.

.THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...
QUIET WEATHER THURSDAY BEFORE THE NEXT SYSTEM ARRIVES FRIDAY. 
TAPERED BACK POPS ON FRIDAY. COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE STATE 
DURING THE DAY. TIMING WILL BE AN ISSUE...OPTED TO BRING THE FRONT 
THROUGH EARLY IN THE DAY...WHICH KEPT HIGHS ON FRIDAY COOL. BROUGHT 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SNOW ALONG WITH THE FRONT...MAINLY CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE STATE. MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED THOUGH...AS 
THETA ANALYSIS SHOWS THE LOW LEVELS NOT QUITE SATURATING. HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVES IN EARLY CHRISTMAS MORNING. H85 TEMPS DROP INTO THE 
MINUS TEENS...EQUATING TO NEAR 10 IN THE NORTH TO NEAR 20 ACROSS THE 
REST OF THE STATE. (22/220)

.DISCUSSION...
RATHER NICE THIS MORNING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WINDS HAVE BEEN 
LIGHT AND VARIABLE...TO NORTHEASTERLY IN MOST OF THE AREA. THIS HAS 
AND WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP WARMING IN CHECK. WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY 
CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL/SOUTHERN MISSOURI WILL MOVE INTO NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS LATER TODAY...BUT THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO NOT HAVE A 
SIGNFICANT EFFECT BEFORE TONIGHT. 

BASICALLY...GOING FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. HAVE UPDATED TEXT FORECASTS 
TO CLEAN UP SOME TEMPORAL WORDING...AND GRAPHICS AND GRIDS TO BETTER 
ADJUST FOR SENSIBLE WEATHER TRENDS. 
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 355 AM CST FRI DEC 17 2004

POLAR JET CONTINUES TO BE DOMINANT IN THE SHORT TERM...WITH ARCTIC 
COLD DRIVEN TOWARD ARKANSAS AND NOT MUCH MOISTURE AVAILABLE. 

NEXT IN A SERIES OF FRONTS SET TO HEAD INTO ARKANSAS FROM THE NORTH 
BY SATURDAY OR SO. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SOME MODERATION IN 
TEMPERATURE TODAY/TONIGHT AS READINGS CLIMB TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS.

AFTER FRONT GOES THROUGH...WILL GET BREEZY AND COLDER. DATA HAS 
TENDED NOT TO BE AS CHILLY BEHIND THE FRONT AS IN PREVIOUS RUNS 
WITH BRUNT OF COLD AIR HEADED TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY. ALSO...WHILE 
COLDEST AIR WILL ARRIVE SUNDAY NIGHT WITH ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE 
SETTLING OVER REGION...RETURN FLOW ALREADY SETTING UP IN 
NORTHERN/WESTERN ARKANSAS SO NOT AS COLD THERE.

WHILE MAY NOT BE AS COLD THIS WEEKEND...STILL EXPECTING BELOW NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES. ALSO...ENOUGH MOISTURE PRESENT AROUND FRONT TO MENTION 
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW/FLURRIES SATURDAY NIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY.

PATTERN BECOMING A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING TO END THE SHORT 
TERM...WITH RIDGE IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES FLATTENING A 
BIT...AND SUBTROPICAL JET BECOMING A LITTLE MORE ACTIVE. MOISTURE 
LEVELS WILL BE MORE APPRECIABLE EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH BETTER 
CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION.

PROGRESSIVE ZONAL FLOW ON TUESDAY WILL ALLOW A COLD FRONT TO SWING 
THROUGH THE AREA. LIGHT RAIN OR SNOW CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THIS 
SYSTEM. THE SNOW WOULD MAINLY BE EXPECTED IN THE MORNING. NORTHEAST 
SECTIONS COULD SEE RAIN OR SNOW TUESDAY NIGHT ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE. PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE OUT OF THE AREA BY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. 

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DIGS INTO THE MID SECTION OF THE COUNTRY ON 
WEDNESDAY AND WILL BRING A SOUTHWEST FLOW BACK TO THE AREA. LIGHT 
RAIN SHOULD OVERSPREAD THE AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND SNOW 
FLURRIES WILL BE SEEN ACROSS THE NORTH HALF OF THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. DRIER AIR MOVES IN FOR THURSDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUT YET 
ANOTHER SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. THE AIR WILL BE 
COLD ENOUGH FOR FLURRIES THURSDAY NIGHT. VERY LOW THICKNESS VALUES 
WILL BE IN PLACE OVER THE AREA THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...516DM

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
355 AM CST FRI DEC 17 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
POLAR JET CONTINUES TO BE DOMINANT IN THE SHORT TERM...WITH ARCTIC 
COLD DRIVEN TOWARD ARKANSAS AND NOT MUCH MOISTURE AVAILABLE. 

NEXT IN A SERIES OF FRONTS SET TO HEAD INTO ARKANSAS FROM THE NORTH 
BY SATURDAY OR SO. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SOME MODERATION IN 
TEMPERATURE TODAY/TONIGHT AS READINGS CLIMB TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS.

AFTER FRONT GOES THROUGH...WILL GET BREEZY AND COLDER. DATA HAS 
TENDED NOT TO BE AS CHILLY BEHIND THE FRONT AS IN PREVIOUS RUNS 
WITH BRUNT OF COLD AIR HEADED TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY. ALSO...WHILE 
COLDEST AIR WILL ARRIVE SUNDAY NIGHT WITH ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE 
SETTLING OVER REGION...RETURN FLOW ALREADY SETTING UP IN 
NORTHERN/WESTERN ARKANSAS SO NOT AS COLD THERE.

WHILE MAY NOT BE AS COLD THIS WEEKEND...STILL EXPECTING BELOW NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES. ALSO...ENOUGH MOISTURE PRESENT AROUND FRONT TO MENTION 
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW/FLURRIES SATURDAY NIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY.

PATTERN BECOMING A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING TO END THE SHORT 
TERM...WITH RIDGE IN THE WESTERN UNITED STATES FLATTENING A 
BIT...AND SUBTROPICAL JET BECOMING A LITTLE MORE ACTIVE. MOISTURE 
LEVELS WILL BE MORE APPRECIABLE EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH BETTER 
CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION. (46)       
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
PROGRESSIVE ZONAL FLOW ON TUESDAY WILL ALLOW A COLD FRONT TO SWING 
THROUGH THE AREA. LIGHT RAIN OR SNOW CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THIS 
SYSTEM. THE SNOW WOULD MAINLY BE EXPECTED IN THE MORNING. NORTHEAST 
SECTIONS COULD SEE RAIN OR SNOW TUESDAY NIGHT ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE. PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE OUT OF THE AREA BY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. 

AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DIGS INTO THE MID SECTION OF THE COUNTRY ON 
WEDNESDAY AND WILL BRING A SOUTHWEST FLOW BACK TO THE AREA. LIGHT 
RAIN SHOULD OVERSPREAD THE AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND SNOW 
FLURRIES WILL BE SEEN ACROSS THE NORTH HALF OF THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. DRIER AIR MOVES IN FOR THURSDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUT YET 
ANOTHER SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. THE AIR WILL BE 
COLD ENOUGH FOR FLURRIES THURSDAY NIGHT. VERY LOW THICKNESS VALUES 
WILL BE IN PLACE OVER THE AREA THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...516DM 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE.

NEXT IN THE SERIES OF FNT/S IS FCST TO MOVE SWD ACRS THE FA SAT AFTN

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL BE APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE 
NORTHWEST ON MONDAY. RETURN FLOW WILL SET UP OUT AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM. SOME MOISTURE INCREASE WILL BE NOTED AS THE SYSTEM MOVES 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THOUGH UPPER SUPPORT AT THIS POINT APPEARS 
TO BE LACKING...SYSTEM COULD SQUEEZE OUT A FEW FLURRIES EARLY 
TUESDAY MORNING. FRONT AND AN ASSOCIATED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
BEGIN MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY ON TUESDAY NIGHT. THERE WILL 
BE A CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN...WITH THE RAIN POSSIBLY 
MIXING WITH SNOW IN THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE 
SUNRISE ON WEDNESDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE FOLLOWED IN RAPID 
SUCCESSION BY YET ANOTHER SYSTEM ON THURSDAY. STRONG NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW WILL BE PREVALENT OVER THIS PORTION OF THE COUNTRY...WITH 
INFLUX OF COLD CANADIAN AIR CONTINUING. 

THERE/S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF TALK LATELY ABOUT THE CHANCES OF WINTRY 
PRECIPITATION DURING THE LATTER EXTENDED PERIODS...PARTICULARLY

PARTICULARLY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS 
THAT ANY WINTRY PRECIPITATION WOULD BE BRIEF...WITH NO ACCUMULATION 
EXPECTED. THAT BEING SAID...KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS FAR OUT...THE

TNGT. MEANWHILE...SFC CDFNT WAS STILL LOCATED TO THE NW OF AR AT MID 
AFTN. WEAK PRE-FRONTAL TROF WAS NOTED OVR EXTREME NWRN AR...ALONG 
WITH SOME MID LVL CLOUDS.

MODEL SOLUTIONS TODAY ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT FOR THE FIRST HALF OF 
THE SHORT TERM...WITH TIMING DIFFERENCES NOTED IN THE LATER PDS. 
EXPECT WEAK FNT TO WORK INTO THE FA TNGT BEFORE FALLING APART ON 
FRI. WITH LIGHT WINDS AND PATCHY CLOUDS...TEMPS TNGT WL NOT BE AS 
COLD AS THIS MRNG/S READINGS.

WEAK RDG OF HIGH PRES WL SETTLE INTO THE STATE FOR FRI AND MOST OF 
SAT. SFC WINDS WL RETURN TO A MORE S-SWLY DIRECTION FRI NIGHT AND 
SAT...ALLOWING TEMPS TO RETURN CLOSER TO NORMAL. EXPECT THE COLDEST 
READINGS FRI NIGHT TO OCCUR IN THE SHELTERED VALLEYS OF NRN AND WRN 
AR.

NEXT IN THE SERIES OF FNT/S IS FCST TO MOVE SWD ACRS THE FA SAT AFTN 
AND NIGHT. ETA SOLUTION IS A BIT FASTER WITH FROPA AS COMPARED TO 
THE GFS. DECIDED TO STICK CLOSER TO THE ETA SOLUTION AT THIS TIME AS 
THE MODEL TENDS TO HAVE A BETTER HANDLE WITH THESE TYPES OF 
AIRMASSES. LATER RUNS SHOULD COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH OVERALL 
TIMING. 

MODELS CONT TO SHOW A BAND OF MOISTURE ALONG AND BEHIND THE 
FNT/PRE-FRONTAL TROF. PLACED SOME POST-FRONTAL POPS /SLGT CHC/ FOR 
SAT AFTN ACRS N AR AND OVR MOST OF THE FA SAT NIGHT. COULD SEE SOME 
OF THE PRECIP BECOME A RAIN/SNOW MIX ACRS N-CNTRL AR SAT EVENING 
WITH CAA IN FULL SWING....WITH NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED. BULK OF SIG 
MOISTURE SHIFTS E OF THE STATE AFT 06Z...BUT HAVE KEPT A MENTION OF 
FLURRIES FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF N AR PER GOING FCST.

BLUSTERY CONDS WL PREVAIL SUN WITH GUSTY NWLY WINDS AND DAYTIME 
TEMPS MAINLY IN THE 30S. THE MERCURY IS EXPECTED TO PLUNGE INTO THE 
TEENS SUN NIGHT OVER THE FA. 
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL BE APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE 
NORTHWEST ON MONDAY. RETURN FLOW WILL SET UP OUT AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM. SOME MOISTURE INCREASE WILL BE NOTED AS THE SYSTEM MOVES 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THOUGH UPPER SUPPORT AT THIS POINT APPEARS 
TO BE LACKING...SYSTEM COULD SQUEEZE OUT A FEW FLURRIES EARLY 
TUESDAY MORNING. FRONT AND AN ASSOCIATED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
BEGIN MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY ON TUESDAY NIGHT. THERE WILL 
BE A CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN...WITH THE RAIN POSSIBLY 
MIXING WITH SNOW IN THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE 
SUNRISE ON WEDNESDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE FOLLOWED IN RAPID 
SUCCESSION BY YET ANOTHER SYSTEM ON THURSDAY. STRONG NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW WILL BE PREVALENT OVER THIS PORTION OF THE COUNTRY...WITH 
INFLUX OF COLD CANADIAN AIR CONTINUING. 

THERE/S BEEN A GREAT DEAL OF TALK LATELY ABOUT THE CHANCES OF WINTRY 
PRECIPITATION DURING THE LATTER EXTENDED PERIODS...PARTICULARLY 
TOWARD CHRISTMAS. BASED ON WHAT IS CURRENTLY INDICATED BY THE 
MODELS...POPS ARE...AT BEST...20 PERCENT. WITH THE COLD AIRMASS IN 
PLACE...THERE COULD BE A MIXTURE OF SNOW FLURRIES OR LIGHT SNOW...
PARTICULARLY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS 
THAT ANY WINTRY PRECIPITATION WOULD BE BRIEF...WITH NO ACCUMULATION 
EXPECTED. THAT BEING SAID...KEEP IN MIND THAT THIS FAR OUT...THE 
MODELS ALWAYS VARY...AND TEND TO COME MORE IN LINE WHEN THE LONG 
TERM PERIODS BECOME THE SHORT TERM PERIODS. FORECASTING PRECIP TYPE 
CAN BE CHALLENGING...PARTICULARLY IN THE LONG TERM PERIODS.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY MOVES OFF TO THE EAST TODAY. AFTER A COLD START 
THIS MORNING...SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO CLIMB 
THIS AFTERNOON FOR READINGS WARMER THAN MONDAY. HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE 
PLAINS WILL MOVE EAST AND INHIBIT SOME WARMING TODAY.

COLD FRONT MOVING SOUTH OUT OF MISSOURI WILL REINFORCE THE COLD AND 
DRY AIRMASS. MODELS HINTING AT SHORTWAVE MOVING NORTHEAST OUT OF 
LOUISIANA HAVING SOME MOISTURE...BUT FIND THIS SCENARIO HARD TO 
BELIEVE DUE TO DRY AIR IN PLACE. HAVE HELD OFF ON PRECIP AT THIS 
TIME...WITH A WIND SHIFT AND INCREASING CLOUDS THE ONLY NOTICEABLE 
FEATURES WITH THE COLD FRONT LATE THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT.

DRY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SATURDAY. WINDS RETURN TO THE 
SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF NEXT TROUGH MOVING SOUTH FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
FOR A BRIEF WARMUP. UPPER TROUGH PLACEMENT WILL BE MAIN PLAYER IN 
TEMPS FOR OVERNIGHT SATURDAY. MODELS ARE SHOWING TROUGH TO BE JUST 
TO THE EAST OF THE AREA...KEEPING THE COLDEST AIR EAST OF THE 
ARKANSAS. HOWEVER...IF TROUGH MOVES TO THE WEST...TEMPERATURES COULD 
BE QUITE COLD FOR SUNDAY MORNING.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
SOME CHANGES NEEDED TO THE EXTENDED GRIDS/ZONES THIS MORNING AS BOTH 
THE NUMERICAL GUIDANCE AND THE MODELS ARE SHOWING COLDER AIR THAN 
PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED COMING BACK IN. FRONTAL SYSTEM AND DEEP TROF 
THAT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT WILL BE WELL EAST OF THE 
STATE BY SUNDAY MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE FOR DAYS FIVE 
AND SIX FOR THE CONTINUATION OF DRY WEATHER. STRONG NORTH TO 
NORTHWEST FLOW FOR SUNDAY AND EARLY MONDAY SETS THE STAGE FOR MORE 
COLD WEATHER BEFORE FLOW DAMPENS OUT LATE ON DAY SIX AS UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGE CRESTS OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST. 

SURFACE HIGH IS OF CANADIAN ORIGIN AND LOOKS TO QUITE CHILLY. 
LOWERED BOTH MAXES AND MINS FOR DAYS FIVE AND SIX. IF ORIGIN OF THE 
HIGH COMES TO FRUITION...TEMPERATURES MAY BE NEEDED TO BE TWEAKED 
DOWNWARD FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY BUT WILL TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH 
FOR NOW.

PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF THE PATTERN CONTINUES AND RIDGE IS QUICKLY 
KICKED EASTWARD BY THE NEXT IN THE SEEMINGLY ENDLESS PARADE OF 
SYSTEMS MOVING THROUGH THE VERY ACTIVE NORTHERN STREAM. RETURN FLOW 
STARTS TO GET REESTABLISHED LATE TUESDAY ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
DEPARTING HIGH BUT BEST CHANCES OF PRECIP WILL FALL BEYOND THE DAY

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
313 AM CST TUE DEC 14 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH 84 HOURS AND NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE GOING FORECAST LIKELY. PROGRESSIVE FLOW 
TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD AND WILL SIMPLY CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS 
NIGHTS THINKING AND GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS. DRY FORECAST 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH ONLY A REMOTE CHANCE OF SCATTERED 
PRECIPITATION ON DAY THREE.

MODELS CONSISTENT WITH TROFFING OVER THE EASTERN CONUS AND RIDGING 
OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. PATTERN KEEPS THE AREA IN A DEEP NORTH TO 
NORTHWEST FLOW TODAY BEFORE FLOW FLATTENS OUT FOR WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY AS NEXT TROF...CURRENTLY OFF THE WEST COAST...APPROACHES. 
TROF PASSES THROUGH THE REGION WITH LITTLE FANFARE THURSDAY NIGHT 
WITH A RETURN TO NORTHWEST FLOW FOR FRIDAY.

ON THE SURFACE...CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS VERY DRY AIR 
MOVING INTO THE STATE WITH DEW POINT TEMPERATURES OVER THE NORTH 
DOWN IN THE SINGLE DIGITS. WHILE CHILLY...ENOUGH OF A GRADIENT 
EXISTS TO KEEP US FROM TOTALLY BOTTOMING OUT THIS MORNING. 
TEMPERATURES ONLY EXPECTED TO RECOVER INTO THE 40S ACROSS THE AREA 
TODAY AS WINDS DIE OFF AND DRIER AIR OVERSPREADS THE AREA. HIGH WILL 
BUILD EASTWARD THIS AFTERNOON AND CREST OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. IDEAL 
RADIATIONAL COOLING AND NO SAVING GRADIENT TONIGHT WITH TEMPERATURES 
EXPECTED TO BOTTOM OUT WITH COLDEST NIGHT OF THE SEASON TO DATE. 
MODELS HINTING AT SOME POSSIBLE RETURN FLOW LATE EARLY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING BUT IT APPEARS TO BE COMING IN TOO LATE TO MAKE MUCH OF AN 
IMPACT.

HIGH SLIPS OFF TO THE EAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND RETURN FLOW DOES 
GET ESTABLISHED WITH CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THICKNESS VALUES 
AND TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

ATTENTION WILL THEN TURN TO THE AFOREMENTIONED APPROACHING TROF AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE BOUNDARY. LOW PRESSURE SCOOTS ACROSS SOUTHERN 
CANADA AND DRAGS THE BOUNDARY ACROSS THE AREA LATE THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT...EXITING THE SOUTHEAST CORER OF THE STATE BY FRIDAY 
MORNING. THERE IS AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE BUT SYSTEM DYNAMICALLY 
CHALLENGED. NO PRECIP EXPECTED AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. CLOUD 
COVER WILL HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES UP THURSDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES 
APPEAR TO REBOUND VERY QUICKLY FRIDAY AFTER THE BOUNDARY PASSES WITH 
TEMPERATURES RETURNING TO NORMAL OR CLOSE TO IT. FWC NUMBERS APPEARS 
TO BE A LITTLE TOO WARM AND WILL GO CLOSER TO THE MAV NUMBERS.

&&
LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY
HIGH PRESSURE ONCE AGAIN WILL BE THE MAIN WEATHER FEATURE. UPPER 
TROUGH WILL STAY JUST TO THE EAST OF THE AREA. ONLY NOTICEABLE 
WEATHER CHANGE WILL BE INCREASED CLOUD COVER. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
NEAR NORMAL.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
313 AM CST TUE DEC 14 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH 84 HOURS AND NO 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE GOING FORECAST LIKELY. PROGRESSIVE FLOW 
TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD AND WILL SIMPLY CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS 
NIGHTS THINKING AND GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS. DRY FORECAST 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH ONLY A REMOTE CHANCE OF SCATTERED 
PRECIPITATION ON DAY THREE.

MODELS CONSISTENT WITH TROFFING OVER THE EASTERN CONUS AND RIDGING 
OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. PATTERN KEEPS THE AREA IN A DEEP NORTH TO 
NORTHWEST FLOW TODAY BEFORE FLOW FLATTENS OUT FOR WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY AS NEXT TROF...CURRENTLY OFF THE WEST COAST...APPROACHES. 
TROF PASSES THROUGH THE REGION WITH LITTLE FANFARE THURSDAY NIGHT 
WITH A RETURN TO NORTHWEST FLOW FOR FRIDAY.

ON THE SURFACE...CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS. SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS VERY DRY AIR 
MOVING INTO THE STATE WITH DEW POINT TEMPERATURES OVER THE NORTH 
DOWN IN THE SINGLE DIGITS. WHILE CHILLY...ENOUGH OF A GRADIENT 
EXISTS TO KEEP US FROM TOTALLY BOTTOMING OUT THIS MORNING. 
TEMPERATURES ONLY EXPECTED TO RECOVER INTO THE 40S ACROSS THE AREA 
TODAY AS WINDS DIE OFF AND DRIER AIR OVERSPREADS THE AREA. HIGH WILL 
BUILD EASTWARD THIS AFTERNOON AND CREST OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. IDEAL 
RADIATIONAL COOLING AND NO SAVING GRADIENT TONIGHT WITH TEMPERATURES 
EXPECTED TO BOTTOM OUT WITH COLDEST NIGHT OF THE SEASON TO DATE. 
MODELS HINTING AT SOME POSSIBLE RETURN FLOW LATE EARLY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING BUT IT APPEARS TO BE COMING IN TOO LATE TO MAKE MUCH OF AN 
IMPACT.

HIGH SLIPS OFF TO THE EAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND RETURN FLOW DOES 
GET ESTABLISHED WITH CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN THICKNESS VALUES 
AND TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

ATTENTION WILL THEN TURN TO THE AFOREMENTIONED APPROACHING TROF AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE BOUNDARY. LOW PRESSURE SCOOTS ACROSS SOUTHERN 
CANADA AND DRAGS THE BOUNDARY ACROSS THE AREA LATE THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT...EXITING THE SOUTHEAST CORER OF THE STATE BY FRIDAY 
MORNING. THERE IS AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE BUT SYSTEM DYNAMICALLY 
CHALLENGED. NO PRECIP EXPECTED AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. CLOUD 
COVER WILL HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES UP THURSDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES 
APPEAR TO REBOUND VERY QUICKLY FRIDAY AFTER THE BOUNDARY PASSES WITH 
TEMPERATURES RETURNING TO NORMAL OR CLOSE TO IT. FWC NUMBERS APPEARS 
TO BE A LITTLE TOO WARM AND WILL GO CLOSER TO THE MAV NUMBERS.

&&
LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY
HIGH PRESSURE ONCE AGAIN WILL BE THE MAIN WEATHER FEATURE. UPPER 
TROUGH WILL STAY JUST TO THE EAST OF THE AREA. ONLY NOTICEABLE 
WEATHER CHANGE WILL BE INCREASED CLOUD COVER. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
NEAR NORMAL.

150 PM CST MON DEC 13 2004

.DISCUSSION...
SURFACE HIGH MOVING OUT OF THE ROCKIES AT MID-DAY. WINDS HAVE NOT
BEEN QUITE AS STRONG AS EARLIER ANTICIPATED...AND WILL ALLOW LAKE
WIND ADVISORY TO END WITH ISSUANCE OF AFTERNOON ZONE PACKAGE. TEMPS
RANGING FROM LOWER 40S EXTREME NORTH TO LOW-MID 50S SOUTH. CLOSEST
CLOUDS ARE IN NE KS AND EC MO...AND POSE NO THREAT TO AR.
&&

.SHORT TERM (THROUGH THURSDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTHEAST AND BE CENTERED OVER SE AR
BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. AIRMASS IS VERY DRY...AND EXPECT LITTLE IF
ANY CLOUDINESS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. SHORTWAVE AND COLD FRONT WILL MOVE
THROUGH AR ON THURSDAY. MOISTURE EXTREMELY LIMITED...AND EXPECT NO
MORE THAN CLOUDS DURING THE DAY THURSDAY.

WHILE SKIES WILL BE CLEAR TONIGHT...EXPECT WINDS TO STAY UP AROUND 5
TO 10 MPH. WHEN COMBINED WITH CURRENT AND UPSTREAM DEWPOINTS...
CURRENT FORECAST LOWS APPEAR ABOUT ONE CATEGORY TOO COOL. HIGHS
TOMORROW ABOUT 7-10 DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY. MAV GUIDANCE APPEARS
TOO COLD BY ABOUT 5 DEGREES. CURRENT FORECAST REASONABLE AND FITS
WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES.

WEDNESDAY MORNING WILL BE THE COLDEST OF THE SEASON WITH SURFACE
HIGH DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA. MOST OR ALL OF ARKANSAS WILL BE IN THE
TEENS WEDNESDAY MORNING. CURRENT FORECAST TEMPS ALSO LOOK
REASONABLE FOR WEDNESDAY...MOS GUIDANCE USUALLY WARMS HIGHS TOO
QUICKLY WITH THE DEPARTING ARCTIC AIRMASS...EVEN WITH SOUTHERLY
WINDS. TEMPS MODERATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY.
&&

.LONG TERM (BEYOND THURSDAY)...
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BE PREDOMINANT FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. NO
SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE AVAILABLE FOR PRECIPITATION. PERIODS OF CLOUDS
MAINLY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...AND AGAIN ON SUNDAY.
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE CLOSER TO SEASONAL NORMS THAN WHAT WE WILL SEE
TOMORROW.

GFS SHOWS POTENTIAL FOR AN EVEN COLDER AIRMASS THE MIDDLE OF NEXT
WEEK...BEYOND THE SCOPE OF THIS FORECAST. COULD BE A CHILLY
CHRISTMAS IF THE PATTERN HOLDS.

NO REAL SURPRISES OR SIGNIFICANT CHANGES CONCERNING THE FORECAST. 
ALL SHORT TERM MODELS ARE ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE PROGRESSIVE 
UPPER LEVEL PATTERN AND THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON TO DATE STILL 
SLATED TO COME ON IN EARLY THIS WEEK. GFS AND ETA ALMOST IDENTICAL 
THROUGH 84 HOURS AND WILL SIMPLY GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS THIS 
MORNING. THERE IS A LITTLE DISCREPANCY IN THE MAV AND FWC NUMBERS. 
FWC NUMBERS CONSISTENTLY RUNNING A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN THE MAV. 
WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCES HERE BUT OVERALL FORECAST WILL STILL BE 
QUITE CHILLY WITH TEMPERATURES BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS...ESPECIALLY 
EARLY IN THE PERIOD.

WITH THE GULF SHUT OFF FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE...DRY CONDITIONS 
WILL PREVAIL. COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH SUNDAY NOW WELL SOUTH OF 
THE AREA WITH CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE SLIDING DOWN THE SPINE OF THE 
ROCKIES. GRADIENT STILL A LITTLE TIGHT AND BIG FORECAST DILEMMA THIS 
MORNING IS WHETHER OR NOT TO ISSUE A LAKE WIND ADVISORY FOR TODAY. 
AS HIGH CONTINUES TO BUILD IN AND SURFACE LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES 
WEAKENS...GRADIENT SHOULD RELAX. SINCE SITUATION IS BORDERLINE AT 
BEST...WILL NOT ISSUE AT THIS TIME BUT I RESERVE THE RIGHT TO CHANGE 
THIS THINKING BY PRESS TIME.

STRONG UPPER LOW OVER THE EASTERN LAKES PULLS OUT IN RESPONSE TO 
STRONG HEIGHT FALLS OVER THE WESTERN CONUS WITH RESULTANT NORTHWEST 
FLOW. NEXT PACIFIC SYSTEM CARVES OUT AS ANOTHER TROF OVER THE GREAT 
BASIN LATE WEDNESDAY WITH WEAK RIDGING OVER THE MID SOUTH FOR SOME 
MODERATION IN TEMPS TOWARDS WEEKS END. CUT OFF FORMS OVER THE SW 
CONUS LATE WHICH WILL BEAR WATCHING DOWN THE ROAD.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS DEW POINT FRONT OVER SOUTHERN MISSOURI 
WITH CONSIDERABLY DRIER AIR TO THE NORTH OF IT. DRIER AIR MOVES OVER 
THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON WITH SURFACE HIGH SETTLING INTO THE TEXAS 
PANHANDLE BY TUESDAY MORNING. WIDESPREAD TEMPERATURES IN THE 20S 
EXPECTED TUESDAY MORNING WITH TEENS IN THE NORTH. JUST ENOUGH OF A 
GRADIENT WILL EXIST TO KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM TOTALLY BOTTOMING OUT 
BUT BY JUST A FEW DEGREES. HIGH MOVES ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY FOR 
VERY COOL READINGS DURING THE DAY. HIGH ON TOP OF THE CWA BY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. DRY AIR...NO WINDS AND SUBSIDENCE SUPPORT 
COLDEST MORNING OF THE SEASON. TEENS LIKELY AREA WIDE WITH SINGLE 
DIGITS IN THE NORMALLY COLDER PLACES.

HIGH SLIPS OFF TO THE EAST WEDNESDAY AND RETURN FLOW STARTS TO GET 
REESTABLISHED LATE IN THE DAY WITH TEMPERATURES SLOWLY MODERATING 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. NEXT COLD FRONT STARTS TO 
APPROACH EARLY THURSDAY AS LOW PRESSURE PASSES WELL TO THE NORTH.

1145 AM CST SUN DEC 12 2004

.DISCUSSION...
THE WINDS ARE NOW STRONGER AND MORE GUSTY THAN EARLIER EXPECTED SO 
HAVE BUMPED THEN UP A BIT FOR THIS AFTRERNOON. WENT AHEAD AND 
INCREASED THE WINDS FOR TOMORROW AND TOMORROW NIGHT BASED ON THE
LATEST GUIDANCE WHICH IS LIKELY TO VERIFY BETTER. WILL LIKELY HAVE 
TO ADJUST THE MINS TONIGHT DOWNWARD SOME MORE...BUT WILL DO THAT 
AFTER THIS MORNING UPDATE. THATS ALL FOR NOW.
(38)    
&&

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION ISSUED AT 232 AM...
.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
OVERALL THE FORECAST IN GOOD SHAPE AND ONLY SOME MINOR CHANGES ARE 
ANTICIPATED. MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL PATTERN OF A 
PERSISTENT WESTERN CONUS RIDGE AND A PERSISTENT EASTERN CONUS TROF. 
PATTERN WOULD KEEP AREA IN A CONTINUOUS AND RATHER DEEP NORTHWEST 
FLOW...ESPECIALLY EARLY ON. WITH ALL SHORT TERM MODELS AGREEING ON 
THIS SCENARIO AND WITH NO MAJOR DIFFERENCES NOTED...WILL GO WITH A 
BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS MORNING.

PATTERN DURING THE PERIOD WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY WEAK COLD FRONTS 
MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. THESE FEATURES WILL COME THROUGH DRY AS 
MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS ARE LACKING. FRONTS WILL ACT TO REINFORCE THE 
COOL AIR OVER THE MID SOUTH WITH SOME OF THE COLDEST AIR OF THE 
SEASON PROGGED TO COME IN EARLY NEXT WEEK.

FIRST FRONT NOW MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE AREA BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. SOUTHERLY WINDS IN ADVANCE OF THE 
SYSTEM WILL ALLOW FOR SOME WARMING TODAY BEFORE FROPA. TEMPERATURES 
COOLER MONDAY MORNING BUT MODELS BRING IN A SECONDARY SHOT OF 
CONSIDERABLY COOLER AIR EARLY MONDAY AS CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE 
SLIDES DOWN THE FRONT RANGE OF THE ROCKIES. VERY DRY AIR MOVES IN 
FOR TUESDAY MORNING AND EXCEPTIONAL RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED WITH VIRTUALLY NO WIND. GUIDANCE SUGGESTING LOW TO MID 20S 
ACROSS THE SOUTH AND CENTRAL AND LOWER TEENS ACROSS THE NORTH. SEE 
NO REASON TO ARGUE AT THIS POINT AND WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE 
SOME OF THE NORMALLY COLDER AREAS DIP INTO THE SINGLE DIGITS.

HIGH SETTLES OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY MORNING FOR ANOTHER COLD 
NIGHT. MODELS IN A BIT OF DISAGREEMENT ON HOW COLD IT WILL GET. GFS 
SOLUTION WOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES COMPARABLE TO TUESDAY MORNINGS. 
ETA12 SOLUTION HAS A LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPING BUT EVEN IF 
THIS COMES TO FRUITION...TEMPERATURES WOULD LIKELY BE ONLY A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER. HIGH SLIPS OFF TO THE EAST ON WEDNESDAY WITH A 
NEXT FRONT BEGINNING TO APPROACH THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE STATE.  
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
WEAK FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY...BUT WILL REMAIN DRY. ONLY 
NOTICEABLE CHANGE WILL BE WIND SHIFT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL FOLLOW AND 
REMAIN IN CONTROL FOR DRY CONDITIONS. TEMPS WILL GRADUALLY WARM 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. NO MAJOR CHANGES TO THE GOING GRIDS.

855 PM CST SAT DEC 11 2004

.DISCUSSION...
HAVE JUST SENT OUT AN UPDATE TO THE FORECAST. FOR THE MOST 
PART...GOING PACKAGE LOOKED OKAY FOR THE DELTA REGION...AND A LARGE 
PORTION OF CENTRAL ARKANSAS...BUT LOCAL ADJUSTMENTS HAD TO BE MADE 
TO BETTER HANDLE VALLEY AREAS IN THE WEST AND NORTH. WINDS IN THE 
VALLEYS HAVE GONE NEAR CALM...AND WITH ONLY SOME THIN CIRRUS NOTED...
THESE AREAS WILL HAVE A GOOD SHOT AT SOME STRONG RADIATIONAL 
COOLING. ALSO...WINDS ARE A BIT STRONGER OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND 
IN THE DELTA REGION...SO KEPT THESE AREAS WARMER AS THE INCREASING 
SOUTHERLY FLOW PUTS THE SKIDS ON SIGNIFICANT COOLING. 

SOME OF THE MORE TYPICAL COLD SPOTS...LEAD HILL...GILBERT...
RUSSELLVILLE...WILL LIKELY SEE READINGS BELOW FREEZING. HAVE 
ATTEMPTED TO REFLECT THIS TREND IN ALL FORECASTS. 

COLD FRONT UP IN THE PLAINS ON SCHEDULE TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. ONLY SHALLOW MOISTURE 
AVAILABLE WITH THE SYSTEM...SO NO PRECIP EXPECTED. HOWEVER...SYSTEM 
WILL BRING REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR INTO ARKANSAS. PERSISTANT...
STRONG NWRLY 500MB FLOW WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MUCH OF THE NEXT FIVE 
TO SEVEN DAYS...BRINGING SOME OF THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON. 
WIDESPREAD TEMPERATURES IN THE TEENS AND 20S ARE EXPECTED BY MIDWEEK 
OVER MUCH OF ARKANSAS. 
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 200 PM CST SAT DEC 11 2004

UPPER PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YESTERDAY.
THE SURFACE LOW DID NOT MOVE OUT AS FAST AS THOUGHT ORIGINALLY. THIS 
RESULTED IN LINGERING LOW CLOUDS AROUND THE RATHER LARGE LOW OVER 
UPSTATE NEW YORK. WARMING IS EXPECTED STILL AHEAD OF SUNDAYS COLD 
FRONT. THEN COOLING WILL TAKE PLACE MONDAY WITH LARGE HIGH DROPPING 
SOUTH ALONG THE PLAINS. THIS HIGH WILL STAY WEST OF THE STATE...SO A 
MUCH DRIER REGIME WILL SET UP OVER THE MID SOUTH. COORDINATION CHAT 
WENT BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE DEW POINTS THAT WILL BE ASSOCIATED 
WITH THIS HIGH. I LEANED TOWARDS AN EVAPORATION WARNING BUT WAS 
OVER-RULED.

SURFACE HIGH WILL BE OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH VERY DRY 
AIR IN PLACE. THIS WILL LEAD TO TEMPS WELL DOWN INTO THE 20S AND DEW 
POINTS IN THE TEENS IF NOT LOWER. THE HIGH MOVES OFF TO THE EAST BY 
LATE WEDNESDAY AND DEW POINTS SHOULD RECOVER SOME. ANOTHER WEAK 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON THURSDAY. SOME MOISTURE ACCOMPANIES IT BUT 
NOT ENOUGH TO MENTION A CHANCE OF PRECIP IN THE FORECAST. BEHIND 
THIS FRONT...THE MAIN SURFACE HIGH IS PROGGED TO BE IN THE GREAT 
BASIN SO THE AIR MASS SHOULD NOT BE AS COLD. STILL WILL HAVE MINS A 
LITTLE BELOW FREEZING WITH MAXES IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S. 
TEMPS SHOULD SLOWLY RISE INTO NEXT WEEKEND WITH WESTERLY SURFACE 
FLOW. GENERAL NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE PERIOD SHOULD HELP 
KEEP THINGS DRY.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
UPPER PATTERN HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YESTERDAY.
THE SURFACE LOW DID NOT MOVE OUT AS FAST AS THOUGHT ORIGINALLY. THIS 
RESULTED IN LINGERING LOW CLOUDS AROUND THE RATHER LARGE LOW OVER 
UPSTATE NEW YORK. WARMING IS EXPECTED STILL AHEAD OF SUNDAYS COLD 
FRONT. THEN COOLING WILL TAKE PLACE MONDAY WITH LARGE HIGH DROPPING 
SOUTH ALONG THE PLAINS. THIS HIGH WILL STAY WEST OF THE STATE...SO A 
MUCH DRIER REGIME WILL SET UP OVER THE MID SOUTH. COORDINATION CHAT 
WENT BACK AND FORTH ABOUT THE DEW POINTS THAT WILL BE ASSOCIATED 
WITH THIS HIGH. I LEANED TOWARDS AN EVAPORATION WARNING BUT WAS 
OVER-RULED.
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
SURFACE HIGH WILL BE OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH VERY DRY 
AIR IN PLACE. THIS WILL LEAD TO TEMPS WELL DOWN INTO THE 20S AND DEW 
POINTS IN THE TEENS IF NOT LOWER. THE HIGH MOVES OFF TO THE EAST BY 
LATE WEDNESDAY AND DEW POINTS SHOULD RECOVER SOME. ANOTHER WEAK 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON THURSDAY. SOME MOISTURE ACCOMPANIES IT BUT 
NOT ENOUGH TO MENTION A CHANCE OF PRECIP IN THE FORECAST. BEHIND 
THIS FRONT...THE MAIN SURFACE HIGH IS PROGGED TO BE IN THE GREAT 
BASIN SO THE AIR MASS SHOULD NOT BE AS COLD. STILL WILL HAVE MINS A 
LITTLE BELOW FREEZING WITH MAXES IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S. 
TEMPS SHOULD SLOWLY RISE INTO NEXT WEEKEND WITH WESTERLY SURFACE 
FLOW. GENERAL NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE PERIOD SHOULD HELP 
KEEP THINGS DRY.

249 AM CST SAT DEC 11 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
WRAP-AROUND CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE OVER THE NORTHEASTERN 
SECTIONS EARLY TODAY AS UPPER LOW MOVES NORTHEASTWARD INTO CANADA.
THE REST OF ARKANSAS WILL SEE MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES
TODAY AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER BAJA CALIFORNIA. A DRY SPELL IS 
EXPECTED OVER MOST OF ARKANSAS THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. WILL USE A 
BLEND OF ETA/NGM/GFS MOS GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES. HIGHS TODAY WILL 
LIKELY BE NEAR NORMAL BUT SHOULD BE ABOUT TEN DEGREES HIGHER 
TOMORROW...THEN BACK DOWN TO NEAR NORMAL THE DAY AFTER AS ANOTHER IN 
A SERIES OF COLD FRONTS MOVES ACROSS MY CW AREA. LOW TEMPS TUESDAY 
NIGHT ARE LIKELY TO BE ABOUT TEN DEGREES BELOW NORMAL AS A CANADIAN
AIR MASS DROPS IN OVER US.
(38)    
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
ONCE AGAIN THIS MORNING...PERSISTENCE SEEMS THE WAY TO GO CONCERNING 
THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS. ALL MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE 
LARGE SCALE WITH A MEAN EASTERN PACIFIC/WESTERN CONUS RIDGE AND A 
MEAN EASTERN CONUS TROF. PATTERN WILL KEEP THE AREA IN A PERSISTENT 
NORTHWEST FLOW THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH OVERALL FLOW FLATTENING OUT 
SOMEWHAT ON OCCASION. TEMPERATURES WILL AVERAGE BELOW NORMAL IN 
SPITE OF GUIDANCE INDICATING A SLIGHT WARMING TREND THROUGH THE 
PERIOD.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OF CANADIAN ORIGIN WILL BE SITTING ON TOP OF 
THE CWA WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH A VERY CHILLY START TO THE DAY. HIGH 
WILL DRIFT OFF TO THE EAST BUT RETURN FLOW IS SLOW TO GET 
REESTABLISHED AND THICKNESS VALUES ONLY SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE MID 
40S. MODELS BRING A WEAK BOUNDARY ACROSS LATE THURSDAY BUT WITH 
LIMITED MOISTURE AND LACK OF DYNAMICS WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY. 
ANOTHER AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE STARTS TO BUILD DOWN THE ROCKIES ON 
FRIDAY BUT HIGH IS OF PACIFIC ORIGIN. THICKNESS VALUES SUPPORT A 
SLIGHT WARMING TREND ON DAYS SIX AND SEVEN AND THIS LOOKS 
REASONABLE. MEX NUMBERS APPEAR TO SUPPORT THIS THINKING AND ARE 
GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

935 PM CST FRI DEC 10 2004

.DISCUSSION...
GOING FORECAST ON TARGET. IN GENERAL...KEPT WINDS UP A LITTLE LONGER 
OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH AND EAST. IN THE SAME AREAS... 
CLOUDS LOOK RATHER PERSISTENT...WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS 
MENTIONED IN THE FORECAST. (46)
&&  

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 230 PM CST FRI DEC 10 2004

IN THE SHORT TERM...UPPER TROF WILL BE MOVING AWAY FROM ARKANSAS 
QUICKLY TONIGHT. THIS WILL RESULT IN A GRADUAL SHIFT FROM NORTHWEST 
FLOW TO ZONAL FLOW BY 12Z TUESDAY. NO MAJOR FEATURES WILL MOVE OVER 
THE STATE IN THIS PERIOD...SO THE SURFACE PATTERN WILL PRESENT THE 
CHALLENGES.

STRONG GRADIENT THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE RELAXING TO THE POINT OF 
WINDS FALLING BELOW OUR LOCAL CRITERIA FOR LAKE WIND ADVISORIES. 
THUS THE ADVISORIES WILL BE ALLOWED TO EXPIRE AT 4 PM WITHOUT 
RENEWAL. LOW CLOUD SHIELD ROTATING AROUND THE SURFACE LOW WILL BE 
LIFTING TO THE NORTHEAST QUICKLY TONIGHT. SMALL CHANCES OF LIGHT 
RAIN WILL EXIST FOR THE EXTREME NORTHEAST SECTION OF THE STATE EARLY 
THIS EVENING...BEFORE 06Z...SO A DRY FORECAST FROM THAT POINT ON.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE GETTING INTO THE 30S TONIGHT AS WINDS DIE DOWN 
AND THE SKY CLEARS. HIGHS SATURDAY WILL BE PRIMARILY IN THE 50S 
BECAUSE OF CONTINUED NORTHWEST WINDS. HOWEVER...RETURN FLOW WILL BE 
QUICK TO SET UP...SO THAT OVERNIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING THE WINDS 
WILL VEER AND PUSH LOWS INTO THE 30S AND 40S. HIGHS ON SUNDAY WILL 
BE HARD TO PEG. THE POTENTIAL TO REBOUND BEFORE THE NEXT FRONTAL 
PASSAGE IS THERE. GFS NUMBERS HAVE BEEN VERIFYING WELL...SO DECIDED 
TO FOLLOW THEM OR GO ABOVE SLIGHTLY. DRY FRONT WILL DROP ACROSS THE 
STATE SUNDAY. TEMPS WILL BEGIN A SLOW COOLING TREND IN NORTHEASTERLY 
WINDS.

IN THE LONG TERM...AREA WILL BE DOMINATED BY HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE 
NORTH WITH MOSTLY NORTHERLY WINDS. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO COOLER THAN 
NORMAL TEMPS. FLOW ALOFT WILL GENERALLY BE FROM THE NORTHWEST WITH 
THE FLOW PATTERN AMPLIFYING BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. KEPT DRY 
WEATHER IN FORECAST. NEW GFS BRINGS A SHEARED SHORT WAVE ACROSS 
TUESDAY WITH SOME MOISTURE INCREASE. INCREASED CLOUDS FOR TUESDAY 
DUE TO THIS BUT LOOKS LIKE MOISTURE WILL BE INSUFFICIENT FOR A 
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION. LOOKS MORE LIKE AN UPSLOPE PRECIP PATTERN 
WHICH WOULD AFFECT AREAS WEST OF THE CWA.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
230 PM CST FRI DEC 10 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
THE UPPER TROF WILL BE MOVING AWAY FROM ARKANSAS QUICKLY TONIGHT. 
THIS WILL RESULT IN A GRADUAL SHIFT FROM NORTHWEST FLOW TO ZONAL 
FLOW BY 12Z TUESDAY. NO MAJOR FEATURES WILL MOVE OVER THE STATE IN 
THIS PERIOD...SO THE SURFACE PATTERN WILL PRESENT THE CHALLENGES.

STRONG GRADIENT THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE RELAXING TO THE POINT OF 
WINDS FALLING BELOW OUR LOCAL CRITERIA FOR LAKE WIND ADVISORIES. 
THUS THE ADVISORIES WILL BE ALLOWED TO EXPIRE AT 4 PM WITHOUT 
RENEWAL. LOW CLOUD SHIELD ROTATING AROUND THE SURFACE LOW WILL BE 
LIFTING TO THE NORTHEAST QUICKLY TONIGHT. SMALL CHANCES OF LIGHT 
RAIN WILL EXIST FOR THE EXTREME NORTHEAST SECTION OF THE STATE EARLY 
THIS EVENING...BEFORE 06Z...SO A DRY FORECAST FROM THAT POINT ON.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE GETTING INTO THE 30S TONIGHT AS WINDS DIE DOWN 
AND THE SKY CLEARS. HIGHS SATURDAY WILL BE PRIMARILY IN THE 50S 
BECAUSE OF CONTINUED NORTHWEST WINDS. HOWEVER...RETURN FLOW WILL BE 
QUICK TO SET UP...SO THAT OVERNIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING THE WINDS 
WILL VEER AND PUSH LOWS INTO THE 30S AND 40S. HIGHS ON SUNDAY WILL 
BE HARD TO PEG. THE POTENTIAL TO REBOUND BEFORE THE NEXT FRONTAL 
PASSAGE IS THERE. GFS NUMBERS HAVE BEEN VERIFYING WELL...SO DECIDED 
TO FOLLOW THEM OR GO ABOVE SLIGHTLY. DRY FRONT WILL DROP ACROSS THE 
STATE SUNDAY. TEMPS WILL BEGIN A SLOW COOLING TREND IN NORTHEASTERLY 
WINDS.
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
AREA WILL BE DOMINATED BY HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE NORTH WITH MOSTLY 
NORTHERLY WINDS. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPS. FLOW 
ALOFT WILL GENERALLY BE FROM THE NORTHWEST WITH THE FLOW PATTERN 
AMPLIFYING BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. KEPT DRY WEATHER IN FORECAST. 
NEW GFS BRINGS A SHEARED SHORT WAVE ACROSS TUESDAY WITH SOME 
MOISTURE INCREASE. INCREASED CLOUDS FOR TUESDAY DUE TO THIS BUT 
LOOKS LIKE MOISTURE WILL BE INSUFFICIENT FOR A CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION. LOOKS MORE LIKE AN UPSLOPE PRECIP PATTERN WHICH WOULD 
AFFECT AREAS WEST OF THE CWA.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
A RATHER STRONG SURFACE BASED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM JUST TO OUR 
NORTHEAST CONTINUES TO DEEPEN AS IT DIVES SOUTHEASTWARD WITH THE
PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS ARKANSAS INCREASING. THIS WILL BRING 
INCREASING WINDS TO MUCH OF ARKANSAS. A LAKE WIND ADVISORY WILL BE 
IN EFFECT TODAY FOR MY ENTIRE CW AREA. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL 
RELAX WITH WINDS DECREASING TONIGHT. 
SOME OF THE WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE WILL SKIRT THE NORTHEAST SECTIONS
THIS EVENING SO WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR A BRIEF PERIOD 
OVER THE NORTHEAST THIS EVENING. THE REST OF MY CW AREA WILL CONTINUE
RAIN-FREE. AND ASIDE FROM THIS SLIGHT CHANCE...LITTLE OR NO RAIN IS 
EXPECTED TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. A SERIES OF COLD FRONTS WILL 
KEEP US IN A ROLLER COASTER SCENARIO THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS WITH 
TEMPERATURES DIPPING BELOW NORMAL AFTER THE FRONTAL PASSAGES.

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...
CONSISTENCY PREVAILS IN THE MEDIUM RANGE WITH NO SIGNIFICANT 
DIFFERENCES IN THE FORECAST SOLUTIONS. ALL MODELS CONTINUE TO 
ADVERTISE PERSISTENT EASTERN CONUS TROFFING THROUGH OUT THE PERIOD 
THAT DOES DAMPEN WITH TIME . RESULT IS A CONTINUOUS NORTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT FOR THE AREA WITH TEMPERATURES RUNNING BEHIND SEASONAL NORMS.

PERIOD SHAPING UP TO BE CHILLY BUT DRY WITH NO REAL PRECIP CHANCES 
UNTIL POSSIBLY LATE ON DAY SEVEN. PERIOD STARTS OFF WITH CANADIAN 
HIGH PRESSURE MOVING INTO THE NATIONS MID SECTION. NORTHEAST 
SURFACE WIND AND SOME MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER THE RIDGE WILL LIKELY 
PRODUCE MORNING STRATUS TUESDAY MORNING AND POSSIBLY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. ONCE STRATUS BURNS OFF...HIGH OVER THE REGION BRINGS MAINLY 
CLEAR...ALBEIT COOL...CONDITIONS. HIGH SLIPS OFF TO THE EAST ON DAY 
SEVEN WITH SOME RETURN FLOW COMING BACK FOR SOME WARMING. NEXT IN 
THE ONGOING SERIES OF COLD FRONTS APPROACHES FOR LATE DAY SEVEN BUT 
WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP FORECAST DRY AS NO SIGNIFICANT DYNAMICS OR 
MOISTURE ARE SEEN THIS FAR OUT.

TEMPERATURES TO AVERAGE 5 TO 8 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR DAYS FIVE 
AND SIX AND MAYBE A DEGREE OF TWO BELOW NORMAL FOR DAY SEVEN. 
OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 20S LIKELY STATEWIDE. MEX NUMBERS LOOK 
REASONABLE AND ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED BUT WILL STILL SHAVE A FEW 
DEGREES OFF THE GUIDANCE FOR DAY SEVEN.

POLAR JET BECOMING MORE OF A FACTOR INTO MID DECEMBER. IN THE 
SHORT TERM...TRANSITIONING FROM HEAVY/EXCESSIVE PRECIPITATION TO 
DRIER/COOLER PATTERN.

GOING FORECAST PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK. FRONT/TROF WILL HEAD QUICKLY 
THROUGH ARKANSAS TONIGHT FROM THE PLAINS...WITH NORTHWEST WINDS 
INCREASING. WINDY WEATHER ANTICIPATED ON FRIDAY...AND WORDED 
ACCORDINGLY IN THE FORECAST. 

ADDED MORE CLOUDS IN THE NORTH/EAST FRIDAY WITH SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
RAIN MENTIONED IN THE NORTHEAST COUNTIES. OTHERWISE...LOOKS DRY AND 
COOLER IN MOST AREAS. (46)

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 224 PM CST THU DEC 9 2004

IN THE SHORT TERM...H5 TROF WILL AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN SECTION OF 
THE COUNTRY TONIGHT WHILE IT CONTINUES MOVING EAST. THE RIDGE TO OUR 
WEST WILL GO THROUGH AMPLIFICATION AS WELL. STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE 
WILL RESULT IN STRONG WESTERLIES ACROSS THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE 
COUNTRY AND AROUND THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.

THE SURFACE PATTERN IS INTERESTING. A SURFACE LOW OVER THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST AND DEEPEN OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 
GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN BEGINNING TONIGHT...SO WINDS WILL INCREASE IN 
STRENGTH OVERNIGHT AND THEY WILL BECOME GUSTY IN CHARACTER FOR 
FRIDAY. THE LOW WILL SHIFT TO THE EAST COAST FRIDAY NIGHT FROM THE 
OHIO VALLEY...BUT ITS CIRCULATION WILL KEEP ENOUGH CYCLONIC BEND TO 
THE ISOBARS TO KEEP WINDS UP DURING THE NIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT.

TEMPERATURES PRESENT ANOTHER CHALLENGING SITUATION...ESPECIALLY FOR 
THE NORTHEAST QUARTER OF THE STATE. COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BE 
PRONOUNCED OVER THAT AREA...AND PRECIPITATION TYPE BECOMES AN ISSUE. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS HINT THAT THE LOWEST LAYERS WILL STAY ABOVE 
FREEZING FRIDAY NIGHT. THE COMBINATION OF WINDS AND ABOVE FREEZING 
IN THE LOWEST 750 METERS MAKE ME LEAN TOWARD LIGHT RAIN ONLY FOR THE 
NORTHEAST SECTIONS AND WITH LOW POPS AT THAT BECAUSE THE DYNAMICS 
WILL BE MOVING AWAY FROM THE STATE.

SATURDAYS HIGHS WILL BOUNCE BACK IN LIGHT OF WESTERLY COMPONENT TO 
WINDS AROUND SURFACE RIDGE OVER THE LOWER GULF COAST AND THE 
DEEPENING TROF OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS/UPPER MIDWEST.

SURFACE LOW ALONG THE CANADIAN BORDER WILL DROP INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
DRAGGING A DRY FRONT ACROSS ARKANSAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON..AND 
REINFORCING THE COOLER AIR FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. 

IN THE LONG TERM...COOLER AIR WILL FOLLOW BEHIND COLD FRONT...WITH 
COOL AND DRY AIR REMAINING THROUGH WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL 
REMAIN COOLER THAN NORMAL...WITH LOWS IN THE 20S TO NEAR 30...AND 
HIGHS IN THE 40S AND LOWER 50S. READINGS WILL WARM BY 
THURSDAY...AHEAD OF NEXT SYSTEM DEVELOPING IN THE PLAINS.

PLAINS WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST AND DEEPEN OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 
GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN BEGINNING TONIGHT...SO WINDS WILL INCREASE IN 
STRENGTH OVERNIGHT AND THEY WILL BECOME GUSTY IN CHARACTER FOR 
FRIDAY. THE LOW WILL SHIFT TO THE EAST COAST FRIDAY NIGHT FROM THE 
OHIO VALLEY...BUT ITS CIRCULATION WILL KEEP ENOUGH CYCLONIC BEND TO 
THE ISOBARS TO KEEP WINDS UP DURING THE NIGHT TOMORROW NIGHT.

TEMPERATURES PRESENT ANOTHER CHALLENGING SITUATION...ESPECIALLY FOR 
THE NORTHEAST QUARTER OF THE STATE. COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL BE 
PRONOUNCED OVER THAT AREA...AND PRECIPITATION TYPE BECOMES AN ISSUE. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS HINT THAT THE LOWEST LAYERS WILL STAY ABOVE 
FREEZING FRIDAY NIGHT. THE COMBINATION OF WINDS AND ABOVE FREEZING 
IN THE LOWEST 750 METERS MAKE ME LEAN TOWARD LIGHT RAIN ONLY FOR THE 
NORTHEAST SECTIONS AND WITH LOW POPS AT THAT BECAUSE THE DYNAMICS 
WILL BE MOVING AWAY FROM THE STATE.

SATURDAYS HIGHS WILL BOUNCE BACK IN LIGHT OF WESTERLY COMPONENT TO 
WINDS AROUND SURFACE RIDGE OVER THE LOWER GULF COAST AND THE 
DEEPENING TROF OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PLAINS/UPPER MIDWEST.

SURFACE LOW ALONG THE CANADIAN BORDER WILL DROP INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
DRAGGING A DRY FRONT ACROSS ARKANSAS SUNDAY AFTERNOON..AND 
REINFORCING THE COOLER AIR FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. 
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
COOLER AIR WILL FOLLOW BEHIND COLD FRONT...WITH COOL AND DRY AIR 
REMAINING THROUGH WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN COOLER THAN 
NORMAL...WITH LOWS IN THE 20S TO NEAR 30...AND HIGHS IN THE 40S AND 
LOWER 50S. READINGS WILL WARM BY THURSDAY...AHEAD OF NEXT SYSTEM 
DEVELOPING IN THE PLAINS.

.DISCUSSION...
RATHER TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT HAS DEVELOPED IN EASTERN OKLAHOMA 
INTO NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM. WINDS HAVE INCREASED DUE TO THIS SO INCREASED WIND FORECASTS
FOR THIS AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH. CONSIDERABLE CIRRUS
COVERS THE AREA TODAY WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE. LOWER CLOUDS SHOULD
INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH LATER THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. DUE
TO THE THINNESS OF THE PRESENT CLOUD COVER...WENT WITH 50 PERCENT
COVERAGE AND PARTLY CLOUDY WORDING FOR THIS AFTERNOON...BECOMING
MOSTLY CLOUDY AS THE OPAQUE LOWER CLOUDS MOVE IN. TEMP FORECASTS
STILL LOOK ON TRACK IN MOST AREAS ALTHOUGH THEY COULD BE A LITTLE
HIGH IN THE NORTHWEST.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 354 AM CST WED DEC 8 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS NOW MOVING OFF TO THE EAST AND IS CURRENTLY 
CENTERED IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH A SHORT 
WAVE ARE SEEN ON INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES MOVING THROUGH TEXAS AND 
OKLAHOMA. SOME OF THESE HIGH CLOUDS WILL MOVE ACROSS ARKANSAS THIS 
MORNING ESPECIALLY THE NORTH SECTIONS. CLOUDS WERE ALSO NOTED ALONG 
THE FRONT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. 

GFS IS MORE CONSISTENT THAN THE ETA THIS MORNING WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE FRONT IN THE GULF AND ITS 
MOVEMENT. THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORT WAVE WILL INTERACT WITH A LOW 
THAT WILL DRAG THE WARM FRONT CLOSE TO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS TO HELP 
INDUCE SHOWERS. SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED MAINLY ACROSS SOUTH AND CENTRAL 
SECTIONS TONIGHT AND WILL KEEP THE NORTH DRY. CLOUDS SHOULD 
INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON AND RAIN CHANCES WILL BE GREATEST IN THE 
SOUTH AND WORK NORTH. SHOULD BE A QUICK EVENT AS THE SYSTEM MOVES 
EAST OF THE AREA BY 12Z THURSDAY. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
IN FOR EARLY THURSDAY MORNING SOUTHEAST AS THE SYSTEM DEPARTS. 

CANADIAN LOW PRESSURE DIVES SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE PLAINS THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON BRINING A COLD FRONT THROUGH ARKANSAS THURSDAY NIGHT. WITH 
1000-500MB THICKNESS VALUES LESS THAN 540 WILL EXPECT COLD AIR TO 
MOVE IN. INCREASING WINDS MAY KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE MIXED ENOUGH TO 
KEEP SURFACE TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING THAT MUCH. NO RAIN EXPECTED 
AS MOISTURE IS RATHER LIMITED. STILL...DECREASED LOWS A FEW DEGREES 
THURSDAY NIGHT. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST FRIDAY NIGHT. 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE DRY. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
NWLY FLOW ALOFT WL CONT TO PREVAIL THRU THE PD. EXPECT MODERATING 
TEMPS SAT AND SUN AS ONE FRONT DEPARTS THE AREA AND ANOTHER APCHS 
FROM THE NW. DECIDED TO RAISE MAX TEMPS SEVERAL DEGREES SUN IN 
ADVANCE OF THE BNDRY. EXPECT FROPA SUN AFTN AND EVENING WITH MUCH 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR TO FOLLOW. LACK OF SIG MOISTURE WILL KEEP RAIN 
CHCS AOB 10 PERCENT TO CLOSE OUT THE WEEKEND. EXPECT READINGS NEAR 
OR JUST BLO NORMAL LVLS EARLY NEXT WEEK.

1140 AM CST WED DEC 8 2004

.DISCUSSION...
RATHER TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT HAS DEVELOPED IN EASTERN OKLAHOMA 
INTO NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM. WINDS HAVE INCREASED DUE TO THIS SO INCREASED WIND FORECASTS
FOR THIS AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH. CONSIDERABLE CIRRUS
COVERS THE AREA TODAY WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE. LOWER CLOUDS SHOULD
INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH LATER THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. DUE
TO THE THINNESS OF THE PRESENT CLOUD COVER...WENT WITH 50 PERCENT
COVERAGE AND PARTLY CLOUDY WORDING FOR THIS AFTERNOON...BECOMING
MOSTLY CLOUDY AS THE OPAQUE LOWER CLOUDS MOVE IN. TEMP FORECASTS
STILL LOOK ON TRACK IN MOST AREAS ALTHOUGH THEY COULD BE A LITTLE
HIGH IN THE NORTHWEST.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS NOW MOVING OFF TO THE EAST AND IS CURRENTLY 
CENTERED IN SOUTHERN ILLINOIS. HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH A SHORT 
WAVE ARE SEEN ON INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGES MOVING THROUGH TEXAS AND 
OKLAHOMA. SOME OF THESE HIGH CLOUDS WILL MOVE ACROSS ARKANSAS THIS 
MORNING ESPECIALLY THE NORTH SECTIONS. CLOUDS WERE ALSO NOTED ALONG 
THE FRONT IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. 

GFS IS MORE CONSISTENT THAN THE ETA THIS MORNING WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE FRONT IN THE GULF AND ITS 
MOVEMENT. THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORT WAVE WILL INTERACT WITH A LOW 
THAT WILL DRAG THE WARM FRONT CLOSE TO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS TO HELP 
INDUCE SHOWERS. SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED MAINLY ACROSS SOUTH AND CENTRAL 
SECTIONS TONIGHT AND WILL KEEP THE NORTH DRY. CLOUDS SHOULD 
INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON AND RAIN CHANCES WILL BE GREATEST IN THE 
SOUTH AND WORK NORTH. SHOULD BE A QUICK EVENT AS THE SYSTEM MOVES 
EAST OF THE AREA BY 12Z THURSDAY. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
IN FOR EARLY THURSDAY MORNING SOUTHEAST AS THE SYSTEM DEPARTS. 

CANADIAN LOW PRESSURE DIVES SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE PLAINS THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON BRINING A COLD FRONT THROUGH ARKANSAS THURSDAY NIGHT. WITH 
1000-500MB THICKNESS VALUES LESS THAN 540 WILL EXPECT COLD AIR TO 
MOVE IN. INCREASING WINDS MAY KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE MIXED ENOUGH TO 
KEEP SURFACE TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING THAT MUCH. NO RAIN EXPECTED 
AS MOISTURE IS RATHER LIMITED. STILL...DECREASED LOWS A FEW DEGREES 
THURSDAY NIGHT. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST FRIDAY NIGHT. 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE DRY.

.DISCUSSION...
FORECAST RIGHT ON TARGET AND NO CHANGES NEEDED. WEAK AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN CONTROL AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ARE 
EXPECTED. BAND OF CIRRUS MOVING ACROSS THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE 
WILL THIN OUT WITH TIME AND WILL NOT HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACTED ON 
FORECASTED LOWS.

WARM FRONT STILL PROGGED TO LIFT TO THE NORTH LATE WEDNESDAY WITH 
ANOTHER CHANCE OF RAIN DURING THE NIGHT. NEW MESO-ETA AND ETA12 NOW 
SHOW PRECIP FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. POPS MAY NEED TO BE 
ADJUSTED UPWARDS WEDNESDAY NIGHT BUT WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY CHANGES 
FOR NOW UNTIL ALL SHORT TERM MODELS COME IN FOR THE MIDNIGHT CREW.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 300 PM CST TUE DEC  7 2004 

WEAK SURFACE HIGH WILL PASS OVER THE AREA TONIGHT WITH QUITE DRY AIR
IN PLACE. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR GOOD COOLING WITH MINS INTO THE 30S 
IN MOST PLACES. THE SURFACE HIGH MOVES EAST EARLY WEDNESDAY AND
RETURN FLOW BEGINS. SHOULD SEE SLOW INCREASE IN MOISTURE DURING THE 
DAY WITH CLOUDS INCREASING LATE. MOISTURE SHOULD BE INSUFFICIENT
FOR A CHANCE OF RAIN BY THE END OF WEDNESDAY. CHANCES OF RAIN 
INCREASE MOSTLY IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS
AN UPPER TROF MOVES IN FROM THE WEST AND THE OLD FRONTAL SYSTEM
LIFTS BACK NORTH TOWARD THE AREA AS A WARM FRONT. WILL KEEP 
MENTION OF RAIN OUT OF THE NORTHERN ZONES AND HAVE MOSTLY CHANCE
POPS ELSEWHERE WITH THE HIGHEST IN THE SOUTHEAST. WILL CONTINUE WITH 
SMALL POPS IN THE SOUTHEAST EARLY THURSDAY WHILE THE UPPER TROF 
CLEARS OUT TO THE EAST. A RATHER STRONG UPPER LOW THEN DIGS INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY WITH INCREASING NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT OVER THIS 
AREA. THE MAIN EFFECTS OF THIS UPPER LOW WILL STAY TO THE NORTHEAST
OF THE AREA. DRY WEATHER SHOULD PREVAIL ACROSS ARKANSAS THROUGH 
FRIDAY. WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMP FORECASTS WITH COOLER AIR 
MOVING IN FRIDAY. 

THIS PERIOD BEGINS WITH NORTHWESTERLY FLOW IN THE WAKE OF FRIDAYS 
LONG WAVE TROF AND IT TRANSFORMS PRIMARILY INTO ZONAL FLOW FOR 
SUNDAY. THE NEXT SHORT WAVE RIDES THE WESTERLIES INTO THE NORTHERN 
AND CENTRAL ROCKIES FOR TUESDAY. IT SHOWS THAT THE NEXT SYSTEM 
BEYOND THIS FORECAST PERIOD WILL NOT DIP AS FAR SOUTH AS THE 
PREVIOUS ONES HAVE DONE. AT THE SURFACE...SATURDAY WILL BEGIN WITH 
NORTHWEST WINDS THAT WILL BACK QUICKLY DURING THE DAY AND INTO 
SUNDAY MORNING. HIGHS SATURDAY SHOULD REBOUND RATHER WELL...AND SO 
WILL THE LOWS FOR SUNDAY MORNING. A WEAK SHOT OF ENERGY WILL BE 
ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES AREA. THIS WILL 
BRING A CORRESPONDINGLY WEAK SURFACE FRONT TO THE MID SOUTH ON 
SUNDAY. THIS FRONT WILL BE LACKING MOISTURE SINCE THE GULF NEVER 
OPENS UP. WITH LIMITED MOISTURE...FORECAST WILL INCLUDE MINIMAL POPS 
WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. NORTHERLY WINDS WILL BE BREEZY SUNDAY 
NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING. COOL AND DRY AIR WILL REESTABLISH ITSELF 
OVER ARKANSAS FOR TUESDAY.

CLOUDS HAVE MOSTLY CLEARED OUT OF THE CWA AS UPPER TROF AND COLD
FRONT MOVE RAPIDLY EAST AWAY FROM THE AREA. SOME STRATOCU HAS
DEVELOPED AT THE WFO AND PROBABLY WILL SEE SOME STRATOCU THROUGH 
THE AFTERNOON AT MANY AREAS ESPECIALLY NORTH AND CENTRAL. THIS
SHOULD CLEAR OUT BY SUNSET AND TONIGHT SHOULD BE CLEAR WITH VERY DRY
AIR IN PLACE. SENT OUT UPDATE TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING AND GO WITH
PARTLY CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON AND CLEAR TONIGHT. TEMP FORECASTS LOOK
PRETTY GOOD AND ONLY MADE MINOR TWEAKS TO GRIDS TO RELFECT OBSERVED
DATA. FAIRLY BREEZY IN NORTH LATE THIS MORNING BUT WINDS SHOULD
DIMINISH THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND ADJUSTED GRIDS FOR THIS.

.DISCUSSION...
CLOUDS HAVE MOSTLY CLEARED OUT OF THE CWA AS UPPER TROF AND COLD
FRONT MOVE RAPIDLY EAST AWAY FROM THE AREA. SOME STRATOCU HAS
DEVELOPED AT THE WFO AND PROBABLY WILL SEE SOME STRATOCU THROUGH 
THE AFTERNOON AT MANY AREAS ESPECIALLY NORTH AND CENTRAL. THIS
SHOULD CLEAR OUT BY SUNSET AND TONIGHT SHOULD BE CLEAR WITH VERY DRY
AIR IN PLACE. SENT OUT UPDATE TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING AND GO WITH
PARTLY CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON AND CLEAR TONIGHT. TEMP FORECASTS LOOK
PRETTY GOOD AND ONLY MADE MINOR TWEAKS TO GRIDS TO RELFECT OBSERVED
DATA. FAIRLY BREEZY IN NORTH LATE THIS MORNING BUT WINDS SHOULD
DIMINISH THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND ADJUSTED GRIDS FOR THIS.

LOTS GOING ON TONIGHT AND DISCUSSION WILL BE BRIEF. NUMEROUS WATCHES 
REMAIN IN EFFECT THIS EVENING FOR SQUALL LINE FORMING ALONG THE 
ADVANCING COLD FRONT. STILL APPEARS THAT SOUTHERN ARKANSAS WILL SEE 
THE BEST CHANCES OF SEEING SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WITH STRONG WINDS 
BEING THE PRIMARY CONCERN.

VERTICAL PROFILES REMAIN FAVORABLE FOR SEVERE DEVELOPMENT BUT LACK OF
STABILITY WILL PRECLUDE WIDESPREAD ACTIVITY. BOW ECHOS WILL BE THE 
PRIMARY CONCERN THIS EVENING WITH AS LINE RACES EASTWARD. CURRENT 
GRIDS/ZONES ACTUALLY NEED VERY LITTLE WORK AT THIS TIME AND WILL NOT 
ISSUE ANY WHOLESALE CHANGES AT THIS TIME.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 315 PM CST MON DEC  6 2004

STRONG UPPER TROF AND COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME WIDESPREAD DURING 
THE EVENING...AND THEN BEGIN TO TAPER OFF FROM THE WEST AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. A FEW SHOWERS MAY BE LEFT OVER THE EASTERN SECTIONS 
TUESDAY MORNING...BUT ALL RAINFALL SHOULD BE GONE BY NOONTIME. DRY 
WEATHER THEN ON TAP FOR THE REMAINDER OF TUESDAY AND DURING THE DAY 
ON WEDNESDAY. RETURN FLOW STARTING WEDNESDAY NIGHT BRINGS A RETURN 
OF SHOWERS TO THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING. 
TEMPERATURES WILL COOL OFF TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS ON TUESDAY. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL THE MAIN STORY...WITH DRY CONDITIONS IN THE 
FORECAST. WEAK FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY...BUT LACK 
OF MOISTURE WILL PREVENT ANY MORE THAN A WIND SHIFT AND COOLER AIR. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL...WITH READINGS

ISSUED AT 922 AM CST MON DEC 6 2004

QUICK UPDATE TO REMOVE DENSE FOG ADVISORY FROM THE ZONE FORECASTS. 
CONTINUED FOG IN THE FORECASTS UNTIL NOONTIME. REST OF PREVIOUS 
FORECAST OKAY.

ISSUED AT 350 AM CST MON DEC 6 2004

TALE OF TWO SEASONS ACRS THE FA THIS MRNG...WITH SPRINGLIKE TEMPS 
NOTED OVER SERN AR AND READINGS MORE TYPICAL OF THIS TIME OF YEAR 
ELSEWHERE. WE CAN THANK A WARM FRONT THAT WAS SITUATED ROUGHLY ALONG 
A KTXK-KPBF-KMEM LINE ATTM. READINGS S OF THE BNDRY WERE WELL INTO 
THE 60S. MEANWHILE...AREAS OF DENSE FOG WERE NOTED N OF THE BNDRY 
AND ALREADY ISSUED A DENSE FOG ADVY THRU MID-MRNG FOR THOSE AREAS. 
MAY HAVE ADD A FEW COUNTIES WITH BNDRY MEANDERING OVR CNTRL AR.

MODELS RMN IS GOOD AGREEMENT WITH OVERALL FCST TRENDS. UPPER SYS 
THAT BROUGHT THE RAINFALL ON SUN WAS HEADING INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION THIS MRNG. MEANWHILE...THE NEXT UPPER LOW TO BRING ROUND TWO 
OF WET WEATHER TO AR WAS LOCATED OVR NRN BAJA/SWRN AZ. THIS FEATURE 
WILL CONT TO HEAD TOWARD THE SRN PLAINS LATER TODAY AND TRACK ACRS 
THE MID-SOUTH TNGT.

EXPECT WARM FRONT TO EVENTUALLY MOVE FURTHER NWD LATER TODAY AS SFC 
LOW DVLPS OVR THE PLAINS AND SLY FLOW INCRS. HOW FAR N OF THE BNDRY 
WILL GET IS ONE FCST CONCERN. AT THIS POINT...IT APPEARS THAT THE 
MORE HUMID AIR WILL AT LEAST ENCOMPASS LOCATIONS ALONG AND E OF THE 
I-30/HWY 67 CORRIDOR. EXPECT ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO 
FORM THIS AFTN IN ADVANCE OF THE UPPER LOW TO OUR SW AND SPREAD NEWD.

THE OTHER FCST CONCERN LATER THIS AFTN AND EVENING IS SVR WX 
POTENTIAL. WE HAVE BEEN HIGHLIGHTING THE POTENTIAL FOR THE LAST FEW 
DAYS. FCST WIND FIELDS RMN FAVORABLE AT THE SFC AND ALOFT FOR 
ROTATING STORMS. HOWEVER...THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY IS STILL IN 
QUESTION IF THE CLOUD COVER RMNS IN PLACE. IT/S TOUGHER THIS TIME OF 
YEAR TO BREAK OUT OF THE STRATUS WITH A LOWER SUN ANGLE. AGREE WITH 
THE LATEST DAY ONE OUTLOOK FROM SPC WITH A MOD RISK OF STORMS FOR 
THE SERN HALF OF THE FA. WILL AGAIN HIGHLIGHT THE POTENTIAL IN THE 
HWO.

CDFNT ASSOCD WITH THE UPPER STORM WILL SWEEP THRU THE STATE LATER 
TNGT AND EARLY TUE AND STALL OUT S OF THE AREA. CONVECTION OVERNIGHT 
EXPECTED TO EVOLVE INTO A SQUALL LINE ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FNT. WL 
CONT WITH HIGHEST POPS THIS EVENING AND DCRS RAIN CHCS FROM THE WEST 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. DID LEAVE SOME LINGERING LOW POPS IN ERN AR TUE MRNG.

HIGH PRES WL BUILD IN BRIEFLY ACRS AR TUE NIGHT AND WED. BY WED 
NIGHT...THE HIGH SHIFTS EWD AND RETURN FLOW SETS UP ONCE AGAIN. FNTL 
BNDRY WILL BEGIN TO RETURN NWD WED NIGHT WITH A CHC OF RAIN BACK IN 
THE FCST.

A WARM FRONT IN THE GULF WILL MOVE ONSHORE THURSDAY AND WILL SET UP 
ANOTHER OVERRUNNING EPISODE. BEST CHANCES OF RAIN WILL BE IN THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE ON THURSDAY. ALSO THERE WILL BE A CHANCE 
OF THUNDERSTORMS IN THE SOUTH. A STRONG COLD FRONT IN THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS WILL SINK SOUTH AND PUSH THE MOISTURE OFF TO THE EAST EARLY 
FRIDAY. AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES EAST OF THE GREAT LAKES...NORTHWEST 
FLOW WILL RETURN TO THE AREA. THIS WILL BRING COOLER TEMPERATURES 
FOR SATURDAY MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES FOR SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
857 PM CST SUN DEC  5 2004

.DISCUSSION...
OVERALL FORECAST IN GOOD SHAPE BUT SOME ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED THIS 
EVENING. CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES WARM FRONT OVER SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS...ROUGHLY ALONG A DEQUEEN TO ARKADELPHIA TO STAR CITY TO 
DUMAS LINE. DEW POINT TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE LOWER 60S 
HERE WITH AMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURE ON THE RISE EVERYWHERE. THE
TEMPERATURE AT THE WFO HAS RISEN AN AVERAGE OF ONE DEGREE PER HOUR 
THIS EVENING.  BELIEVE MOST IF NOT ALL TEMPERATURES HAVE BOTTOMED 
OUT AND SLOWLY RISING OR AT THE VERY LEAST STEADY TEMPS THE REST 
OF THE NIGHT. AS SUCH...GRIDS/ZONES TEMPS AND DEW POINTS ADJUSTED 
UPWARDS. 

WILL KEEP CURRENT POPS ALONE AS SCATTERED SHOWERS EXPECTED TO 
PERSIST IN DEVELOPING WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN. PLENTY OF LOW 
CLOUDS AND FOG AROUND THIS EVENING AND DONT EXPECT THIS TO GO 
ANYWHERE TONIGHT. CROSS SECTIONS SHOW DRY AIR ALOFT BUT WITH 
PERSISTENT SOUTHWEST FLOW LOW LEVELS REMAIN SATURATED. WAS TOYING 
WITH THE IDEA OF A DENSE FOG ADVISORY EARLIER BUT MANAGED TO TALK 
MYSELF OUT OF IT. WHILE POCKETS OF DENSE FOG ARE LIKELY...DONT 
BELIEVE IT WILL BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO MEET CRITERIA AS GRADIENT 
SHOULD REMAIN JUST ENOUGH TO MIX THINGS UP.

CURRENT VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS PLENTY OF TROPICAL MOISTURE BEING PULLED 
INTO THE REGION. STRONG SHORTWAVE ALSO CLEARLY SEEN OVER BAJA. 
MODELS STILL PERSISTENT IN BRINGING THE WAVE ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY 
NIGHT. COLD FRONT EXPECTED TO PLOW INTO THE TROPICAL AIR WITH 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE MOVING TO NEAR THE ARKLATEX BY MONDAY EVENING. 
PLENTY OF DYNAMICS STILL AVAILABLE AND AREA REMAINS UNDER A SLIGHT 
RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER WHICH APPEARS REASONABLE. ONE MISSING FACTOR 
REMAINS STABILITY. ANY WIDESPREAD SUNSHINE MONDAY WILL TAKE CARE OF 
THAT IN A HURRY AND SET THE STAGE FOR SOME POSSIBLY SEVERE STORMS.

PWAT VALUES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE NIGHT AND LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAIN WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE LATE MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. (56)

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 320 PM CST SUN DEC  5 2004


PRECIP SLOWLY CLEARING OUT OF THE AREA...AS WARM BOUNDARY IN THE 
VICINITY OF CENTRAL/NORTHERN LOUISIANA CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHWARD. 
AIRMASS MOISTENING UP...AS SIXTY PLUS DEWPOINTS SURGE NORTHWARD FROM 
LOUISIANA. SATURATED AIR...ALONG WITH LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW FOR 
AREAS OF FOG TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. SOME OF THE 
FOG HAS BEEN DENSE AT TIMES...AND THIS DENSE FOG COULD BECOME MORE 
WIDESPREAD OVERNIGHT. IF THAT IS THE CASE...DENSE FOG ADVISORY WOULD 
NEED TO BE CONSIDERED. 

WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTHWARD TONIGHT...INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...
AND GRADUALLY THROUGH CENTRAL AND INTO NORTHERN ARKANSAS BY MORNING. 
MOST LOCATIONS WILL LIKELY SEE THEIR OVERNIGHT LOWS BY 00Z...WITH 
TEMPERATURES STEADY OR SLOWLY RISING THROUGOUT THE NIGHT. MOST 
SIGNIFICANT RISES WILL BE IN SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. THIS AREA IS NOW IN 
THE MID 50S TO UPPER 50S...AND IS LIKELY TO BE IN THE MID 60S BY 
SUNRISE. 

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME LIKELY BY MONDAY 
AFTERNOON...AS REMAINDER OF THE WARM SECTOR ADVANCES THROUGH

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
857 PM CST SUN DEC  5 2004

.DISCUSSION...
OVERALL FORECAST IN GOOD SHAPE BUT SOME ADJUSTMENTS ARE NEEDED THIS 
EVENING. CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES WARM FRONT OVER SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS...ROUGHLY ALONG A DEQUEEN TO ARKADELPHIA TO STAR CITY TO 
DUMAS LINE. DEW POINT TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO THE LOWER 60S 
HERE WITH AMBIENT AIR TEMPERATURE ON THE RISE EVERYWHERE. THE
TEMPERATURE AT THE WFO HAS RISEN AN AVERAGE OF ONE DEGREE PER HOUR 
THIS EVENING.  BELIEVE MOST IF NOT ALL TEMPERATURES HAVE BOTTOMED 
OUT AND SLOWLY RISING OR AT THE VERY LEAST STEADY TEMPS THE REST 
OF THE NIGHT. AS SUCH...GRIDS/ZONES TEMPS AND DEW POINTS ADJUSTED 
UPWARDS. 

WILL KEEP CURRENT POPS ALONE AS SCATTERED SHOWERS EXPECTED TO 
PERSIST IN DEVELOPING WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN. PLENTY OF LOW 
CLOUDS AND FOG AROUND THIS EVENING AND DONT EXPECT THIS TO GO 
ANYWHERE TONIGHT. CROSS SECTIONS SHOW DRY AIR ALOFT BUT WITH 
PERSISTENT SOUTHWEST FLOW LOW LEVELS REMAIN SATURATED. WAS TOYING 
WITH THE IDEA OF A DENSE FOG ADVISORY EARLIER BUT MANAGED TO TALK 
MYSELF OUT OF IT. WHILE POCKETS OF DENSE FOG ARE LIKELY...DONT 
BELIEVE IT WILL BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO MEET CRITERIA AS GRADIENT 
SHOULD REMAIN JUST ENOUGH TO MIX THINGS UP.

CURRENT VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS PLENTY OF TROPICAL MOISTURE BEING PULLED 
INTO THE REGION. STRONG SHORTWAVE ALSO CLEARLY SEEN OVER BAJA. 
MODELS STILL PERSISTENT IN BRINGING THE WAVE ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY 
NIGHT. COLD FRONT EXPECTED TO PLOW INTO THE TROPICAL AIR WITH 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE MOVING TO NEAR THE ARKLATEX BY MONDAY EVENING. 
PLENTY OF DYNAMICS STILL AVAILABLE AND AREA REMAINS UNDER A SLIGHT 
RISK FOR SEVERE WEATHER WHICH APPEARS REASONABLE. ONE MISSING FACTOR 
REMAINS STABILITY. ANY WIDESPREAD SUNSHINE MONDAY WILL TAKE CARE OF 
THAT IN A HURRY AND SET THE STAGE FOR SOME POSSIBLY SEVERE STORMS.

PWAT VALUES WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE NIGHT AND LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAIN WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE LATE MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. (56)

INDICATES WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHERN LOUISIANA AND SLOWLY

ISODROSOTHERMAL GRADIENT...CURRENTLY OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS...
EXTENDING DOWN TOWARD SOUTHEASTERN ARKANSAS. 

RADAR TRENDS CONTINUE SHOWING A GENERAL DECREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST. 
HAVE THUS REFLECTED THESE TRENDS IN THE FORECAST FOR THE REMAINDER 
OF THE AFTERNOON. PRECIPITABLE WATERS STILL NOT THAT GREAT LOOKING 
AT 12Z SOUNDING...SO RAINFALL HAS MOSTLY BEEN LIGHT WITHIN MUCH OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. 

TEMPERATURES ARE ANOTHER PAIN TO CONTEND WITH. WITH CONTINUED 
STRATOCU OVER NORTH AND CENTRAL...AND STRATUS ADVANCING NORTHWARD

AS CLOUDS CONT TO THICKEN AND RAINFALL MOVES IN.

THIS FIRST UPPER SYSTEM SHIFTS NE OF THE AREA THIS EVENING...GIVING 
US A BREAK IN THE RAINFALL. MORE HUMID AIRMASS WL ALSO BE WORKING 
SLOLY NWD TNGT AS SFC WINDS BECOME MORE SLY. LOOKING AT LOWS TNGT 
OCCURRING ARND 00Z...AND THEN RMNG STEADY AND EVEN SLOLY RISING DURG 
THE OVERNIGHT HRS.

NEXT UPPER SYS...CURRENTLY OFF THE CA COAST...IS FCST TO TURN EWD 
AND HEAD TOWARD THE SRN PLAINS LATER MON AND MON NIGHT. THIS WILL 
BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF RAIN AND STORMS TO THE STATE. THE POTENTIAL 
DOES EXIST FOR STRONG OR SVR STORMS FOR THE AREA MON AFTN AND 
EVENING AHEAD OF SFC CDFNT. FCST WIND FIELDS AT THE SFC AND ALOFT 
RMN FAVORABLE FOR SOME ROTATING STORMS. HOWEVER...THE AMOUNT OF 
INSTABILITY IS STILL IN QUESTION MON AFTN IF CLOUDS PERSIST AND 
LIMIT AFTN HEATING. PLAN TO MENTION THIS SCENARIO IN THE HWO.

MODEL SOLUTIONS THIS MRNG HAVE TRENDED SLOWER WITH THE SECOND UPPER 
SYS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THUS...HAVE HAD TO HOLD ONTO RAIN CHCS 
INTO MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUE FOR MUCH OF THE FA. TODAY/S MODEL 
RUNS SHOULD GET A BETTER HANDLE ON THE SECOND UPPER LOW AS IT WORKS 
ONSHORE AND IS SAMPLED BY GROUND BASED SOUNDINGS.

TEMPS ARE CERTAINLY A TOSS UP FOR THE SHORT TERM WITH PRECIP TIMING 
AND CLOUD COVER. LEANED TOWARD THE COOLER GFS MOS FOR TODAY AND 
TNGT. BOTH GFS AND ETA MOS READINGS IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR MON THRU 
TUE.

HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND WEDNESDAY. DRY AIR WILL BE IN PLACE AS RIDGING DEVELOPS ACROSS 
THE REGION THROUGH WEDNESDAY. A WARM FRONT IN THE GULF WILL MOVE 
ONSHORE THURSDAY AND WILL SET UP ANOTHER OVERRUNNING EPISODE. 
MOISTURE INCREASES OVER THE AREA ON THURSDAY AND THIS WILL KEEP 
CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION IN THE AREA...AND WILL LEAVE POPS IN THE 
40S AT THIS TIME. SOUTHERN SECTIONS WILL HAVE A CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS. UPPER TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AND DRIER 
AIR FOLLOWS. HIGH PRESSURE MOVES IN FRIDAY BRINGING DRY WEATHER ON

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE RIGHT ON TARGET AND ONLY SUPERFICIAL 
CHANGES ARE NEEDED. ONLY A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO THE GRIDS ARE NEEDED 
TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS WITH IMPACT ON THE PRODUCTS TRANSPARENT.

WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY SITTING IN THE GULF WILL BE MOVING NORTHWARD 
THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH OVERRRUNING RAIN DEVELOPING THROUGH THE 
NIGHT. STILL EXPECTING THE MAJORITY OF THE NIGHT TO BE DRY BUT RAIN 
WILL QUICKLY OVERSPREAD THE AREA SUNDAY MORNING. CATEGORICAL POPS 
LOOK GOOD WITH A GENERAL ONE QUARTER TO ONE HALF INCH RAIN EXPECTED.
TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED OFF TO ONLY A FEW DEGREES ABOVE FORECASTED 
LOWS BUT EXPECTING THEN TO STEADY OUT THE REST OF THE NIGHT AS 
SOUTHERLY FLOW INCREASES AND MOISTURE LEVELS RISE.

RAINFALL WILL BE FURTHER ENHANCED BY AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE 
CLEARLY SEEN ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SPINNING OVER THE BAJA. WAVE 
WILL LIFT OUT DURING THE NIGHT AND PASS TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE 
STATE SUNDAY. GOOD PUNCH OF DRY AIR LATE IN THE DAY WILL END THE 
PRECIP FOR THE TIME BEING.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY ALSO SHOWING ANOTHER...MORE IMPRESSIVE WAVE IN 
THE EASTERN PACIFIC...OFF THE CENTRAL CALIF COAST. THIS WAVE WILL 
APPROACH THE CWA LATE MONDAY WITH MORE RAIN LIKELY. DYNAMICS COMING 
TOGETHER QUITE NICELY LATE MONDAY FOR POTENTIAL SEVERE WEATHER 
OUTBREAK. ONLY SAVING GRACE IS ATMOSPHERE IS NOT OVERLY UNSTABLE 
BUT ANY SUNSHINE MONDAY WOULD TAKE CARE OF THAT. WILL NEED TO KEEP A 
CLOSE EYE ON THE EVOLUTION OF THIS SYSTEM FOR LATE MONDAY/MONDAY 
NIGHT TIME FRAME.

ISSUED AT 315 PM CST SAT DEC 4 2004

VERY COMPLICATED AND CUMBERSOME WEATHER SITUATION SETTING UP FOR 
MUCH OF THE SHORT TERM PERIODS. WARM BOUNDARY CURRENTLY MOVING UP 
TOWARD THE GULF COAST...WITH STRONG SHORTWAVE APPROACHING FROM THE 
DESERT SOUTHWEST. ASSOCIATED PACIFIC AND GULF MOISTURE WILL GREATLY 
INCREASE TONIGHT AS THE SYSTEM APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA. EXPECT 
RAIN TO BEGIN DEVELOPING SOME TIME AFTER MIDNIGHT...BECOMING LIKELY 
AREAWIDE BY MID MORNING. CONTINUED CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SUNDAY...AS 
THE WARM BOUNDARY AND UPPER SYSTEM MOVE ACROSS THE AREA. 

RAIN WILL DECREASE BEGINNING LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON...AS STRONG DRY 
INTRUSION PUNCHES IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST. 

TEMPERATURE TRENDS WILL BE VERY HARD TO PIN DOWN ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT...AS WARM SECTOR ADVANCES NORTHWARD THROUGH CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS. NOCTURNAL VARIANCE SOUTH OF THE FRONT WILL BE 
VERY LITTLE TO ALMOST NONE. IN CENTRAL ARKANSAS AND NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS...MANY LOCATIONS WILL LIKELY SEE LOWS IN THE EARLY TO MID 
EVENING...WITH TEMPERATURES NEARLY STEADY OR SLOWLY RISING FROM 
AROUND MIDNIGHT ON.

ROUND TWO BEGINS ON MONDAY. STRONG COLD FRONT AND YET ANOTHER IN 
THIS SERIES OF 500MB TROUGHS WILL ADVANCE TOWARD THE MID AND LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP IN THE 
WARM SECTOR DURING THE LATE MORNING...AND INTO THE AFTERNOON AS THE 
UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS...AND SEVERAL STRONG UPPER IMPULSES MOVE 
UP IN THE MEAN FLOW. SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE ONGOING ALONG THE 
COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS ON MONDAY NIGHT. 

SEVERE WEATHER IS A GOOD POSSIBILITY ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. 
TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF WIND ENERGY WILL BE PRESENT...WITH 60KT OR 
GREATER MIDLEVEL JET...AND 110KT OR GREATER UPPER LEVEL JET. PLENTY 
OF DIRECTIONAL SHEAR AVAILABLE AS WELL. THUS...POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR 
STRONG...DAMAGING WINDS AND ISOLATED TORNADOES. CAN EXPECT A FEW 
HAILERS AS WELL. THE FRONT WILL MOVE INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS ON MONDAY 
NIGHT...WITH STORMS BECOMING MORE LINEAR.

ONE FLY IN THE OINTMENT IS POTENTIAL CLOUD COVER ON MONDAY. IF 
CLOUDS CAN BREAK UP ENOUGH...AND SUFFICIENT DESTABILIZATION CAN 
OCCUR...THUNDERSTORMS COULD GET GOING FAIRLY EARLY. HOWEVER...IF THE 
CLOUDS CANT BREAK...LACK OF SURFACE BASED HEATING COULD ACT TO 
PRECLUDE SIGNIFICANT DEVELOPMENT. 

WHILE PRECIPITABLE WATERS WILL BE IN THE ONE TO TWO INCH RANGE...
WINDS ALOFT SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO KEEP STORMS MOVING. THAT 
BEING SAID HOWEVER...THERE COULD BE AT LEAST ONE TO TWO INCHES OF 
RAINFALL...MOSTLY EAST OF A LINE FROM ASH FLAT TO MENA. WITH AS MUCH 
RAINFALL THAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE STATE DURING THE LAST TWO 
MONTHS...AND SEVERAL RIVERS NEAR OR ABOVE FLOOD STAGE...THE 
ABUNDANCE OF RAIN COULD CREATE EVEN MORE FLOODING PROBLEMS. 

A FEW CLOUDS MAY LINGER OVER THE NORTH ON TUESDAY...AS WRAPAROUND 
ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS. OTHERWISE...SHORT TERM 
WILL END ON A QUIET NOTE...WITH SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE MOVING IN 
FROM THE PLAINS. 

LONG TERM STARTS OFF TRANQUIL...BUT ONLY BRIEFLY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
SHIFT TO THE EAST...WITH RETURN FLOW BRINGING MOISTURE WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT/THURSDAY. SUBTROPICAL JET CONTINUES TO BE ACTIVE...WITH SYSTEM 
RIDING SOUTHWEST WIND ALOFT TOWARD REGION. SYSTEM WILL TRIGGER 
SCATTERED SHOWERS ON THURSDAY...WITH ATMOSPHERE UNSTABLE ENOUGH FOR

.DISCUSSION...
NO UPDATES NEEDED THIS EVENING. CURRENT FORECAST RIGHT ON TRACK WITH 
ONLY MINOR TWEAKING OF THE GRIDS NEEDED. HIGH PRESSURE...DRY AIR 
MASS AND LIGHT WINDS WILL SET THE STAGE FOR ANOTHER SUB FREEZING 
NIGHT. WITH ALL AREAS OF THE CWA NOW HAVING EXPERIENCED SUB FREEZING 
TEMPS...HIGHLIGHTS NO LONGER NEEDED.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 255 PM CST THU DEC  2 2004

WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION TODAY...BUT WITH LITTLE MORE THAN 
A WIND SHIFT. HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND FRONT WILL PROVIDE DRY WEATHER 
THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY...WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

READINGS WILL DROP BELOW FREEZING TONIGHT AND AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT IN 
SOME AREAS. HOWEVER...MOST SPOTS HAVE ALREADY HAD A FREEZE...SO 
FREEZE WARNING NOT NECESSARY.

TOWARD THE END OF THE SHORT TERM...HIGH PRESSURE WILL HEAD EAST WITH 
WINDS BECOMING MORE SOUTHERLY. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE RAPIDLY 
SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH RAIN BECOMING LIKELY THROUGH SUNDAY. 

LOOKS UNSTABLE ENOUGH FOR AT LEAST A MENTION OF THUNDER IN SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS SUNDAY. KEPT IT RAIN FARTHER NORTH. (46)

RAINY PERIOD GRADUALLY WILL BE COMING TO AN END BY LATE MONDAY...AS 
SURFACE HIGH PUSHES IN FROM THE PLAINS...AND COLD FRONT MOVES OUT OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. DRY WEATHER WILL BE SHORT LIVED...HOWEVER AS MID 
AND UPPER FLOW REMAINS STRONG AND ZONAL. DUE LARGELY TO 
STRENGTHENING UPPER RIDGE IN THE EASTERN GULF...FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WILL STALL...AND BEGIN MOVING BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. 

SURFACE LOW APPEARS TO DEVELOP ALONG THE BOUNDARY...AND STRONG UPPER 
TROUGH WILL INTERACT WITH THE SYSTEM...ALLOWING FOR MORE RAIN ON 
WEDNESDAY INTO EARLY THURSDAY AS THE SURFACE SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF ARKANSAS. WILL BE CONTENDING WITH POSSIBLE 
MIXED PRECIP ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING OVER ABOUT THE 
NORTHWESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA /FROM BOONEVILLE TO ASH 
FLAT...AND WESTWARD/.  NEAR TO BELOW FREEZING SURFACE TEMPERATURES...
AND LOW 1000-500 MB THICKNESS VALUES WARRANT AT LEAST A MENTION OF A 
MIXTURE OF RAIN AND FLURRIES. TEMPERATURES...WHERE BELOW FREEZING...
SHOULD ONLY BE THAT WAY BRIEFLY WHICH SHOULD HELP TO PRECLUDE A 
CHANGEOVER. UPPER RIDGE WILL PUSH INTO THE REGION BY THURSDAY 
MORNING...BRINGING A DRY AND COOL END TO THE EXTENDED PERIODS. 

BIGGEST CHANGE TO THE EXTENDED PERIODS WAS TO ADD MIXED PRECIP TO 
THE NORTHWEST. ALSO...ADJUSTED POP TRENDS BETTER IN LINE WITH 
CURRENT THINKING. (57)

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY
HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL THIS MORNING...WITH ONLY A FEW HIGH CLOUDS 
MOVING TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE STATE. TEMPERATURES THIS 
MORNING HAVE APPROACHED OR FALLEN BELOW FREEZING ACROSS THE 
AREA...WITH FREEZE WARNING IN EFFECT FOR THE SOUTHEAST UNTIL 8 AM.

MAIN STORY IN THE SHORT TERM IS TEMPERATURES. A WEAK FRONT WILL MOVE 
IN FROM THE NORTHWEST TODAY...BUT DUE TO LACK OF MOISTURE...WILL 
ONLY NOTICE A WIND SHIFT AND SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS. AN INCREASE IN 
CLOUDS WILL BE SEEN IN THE NORTH...BUT OVERALL MOSTLY SUNNY 
CONDITIONS TODAY.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. AS THE HIGH MOVES 
EAST SATURDAY...SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL BRING MOISTURE BACK TO THE AREA 
SATURDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. FRIDAY AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE SIMILAR TO TODAY...WITH HIGHS SATURDAY A FEW DEGREES WARMER 
DUE TO THE HIGHER MOISTURE CONTENT.

THE NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN COMES AHEAD OF TROUGH IN THE DESERT 
SOUTHWEST. TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY WILL BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER DUE 
TO CLOUD COVER AND RAIN.

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVES WILL ROTATE THROUGH THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. KEPT CHANCE POPS IN FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO

AHEAD OF ANOTHER UPPER TROF WEDNESDAY. WENT WITH DRY FORECAST 
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY BUT BROUGHT CHANCE POPS IN
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AHEAD OF THE NEXT UPPER LOW. GULF OPENS UP
WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM AND A COLD FRONT MOVING DOWN THE
PLAINS. MOISTURE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR A CHANCE OF RAIN BY
LATE IN THE DAY. FAIRLY GOOD BLAST OF COLD AIR WILL MOVE INTO
THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT BUT IT DOES NOT LOOK AS COLD AS IT
DID ON YESTERDAYS GFS AND THIS IS LIKELY TO CHANGE FACE A FEW
TIMES BEFORE THE TIME ARRIVES. BASED ON THE WET PATTERN FOR

THE GENERAL AREA...BUT MOISTURE LOOKS SCARCE WITH ALL OF THEM AND
THEIR MAIN IMPACT WILL BE ON OTHER AREAS. THERE SHOULD BE A GOOD 
WARMUP ON WEDNESDAY WITH MAXES WELL INTO THE 50S BUT ANOTHER GOOD
NIGHT OF RADIATIONAL COOLING WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH NEARLY CALM
WINDS AND DRY AIR IN PLACE.

LOCAL RADARS ARE CURRENTLY ARE INDICATING RAINFALL...COVERING MOST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. AN OVERALL DECREASE IN INTENSITY OF THE 
PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN NOTED SINCE 18Z.  

LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH NOW LOCATED 
JUST EAST OF THE FOUR CORNERS REGION. THIS FEATURE WILL CONTINUE 
EASTWARD...THEN WILL ACCELERATE NORTHEAST BY LATE TUESDAY.

MAIN CONCERN IS FOR POTENTIAL FOR EXCESSIVE RAINFALL OVERNIGHT. 
EXPECT PRONOUNCED ISENTROPIC LIFT IN THE 750-850 LAYER TO CONTINUE 
FOR MUCH OF THE OVERNIGHT HOURS...WITH THE STRONGEST AXIS OF LIFT TO 
MOVE EASTWARD WITH TIME. ALTHOUGH ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS ARE QUITE 
WET...EXPECTED NATURE OF PRECIPITATION /MAINLY STRATIFORM/...AND QPF 
DOES NOT SUPPORT A FLASH FLOOD WATCH. NEAR TERM CONDITIONS WILL BE 
CLOSELY MONITORED.

PRECIPITATION WILL DECREASE ON TUESDAY...AS THE STRONGER FORCING 
MOVES EASTWARD. ALL PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE CLEAR OF THE FORECAST 
AREA BY 01/06Z.

UPPER TROF MOVING OUT OF THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. TOWARD THE AREA. 
RAIN HAS REACHED ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA AT ISSUE TIME
AND SHOULD SLOWLY SPREAD TO THE EAST AS THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE
ATMOSPHERE SATURATE. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA TODAY
AND WARM ADVECTION WILL HELP GET RAIN GOING IN MOST ALL AREAS. 
THIS WILL CONTINUE OFF AND ON THROUGH TUESDAY. A WEAK FRONT MAY 
MOVE THROUGH TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY WHICH WILL BACK WINDS AT LOWER 
LEVELS AND SET UP MORE OF AN OVERRUNNING SITUATION. OVERALL 
INSTABILITY WILL BE LACKING BUT SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY MAY 
BE SEEN ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH. WILL GO WITH STEADY STRATIFORM

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
MODELS SHOWING A FEW DIFFERENCES TODAY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH 
BOTH THE GFS AND ETA COMING BACK WEAKER WITH THE DEVELOPING SYSTEM 
AND QUICKER WITH MOVING IT OUT TUESDAY NIGHT. ETA CHANGES APPEAR TO 
BE MORE DRASTIC WHICH WOULD LEND SUPPORT TO THE GFS. OF GREATER 
CONCERN IS THE WEDGE OF DRY AIR BELOW 700MB BOTH MODELS ARE SHOWING. 
COLUMN DOES NOT REALLY SATURATE UNTIL MID MORNING. ONLY REAL EFFECT 
WOULD BE TO HOLD OFF THE STEADIER RAIN UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY. WITH 
HEAVIER RAIN NOT EXPECTED UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY AND WITH FLASH 
FLOOD GUIDANCE AROUND 3 INCHES PER SIX HOURS...WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY 
HIGHLIGHTS FOR NOW.

HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO SLIP OFF TO THE EAST AND CLOUDS COMING IN 
A LITTLE FASTER THAN SCHEDULED. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CONTINUES TO 
SHOW THE MAIN PLAYERS QUITE CLEARLY THIS AFTERNOON. PLUME OF PACIFIC 
MOISTURE CONTINUES TO STREAM INTO THE AREA ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY 
OF AN UPPER LEVEL HIGH SITTING IN THE GULF. PWAT VALUES FORECAST TO 
RISE TONIGHT AND BE BETWEEN 1 AND 1/5 INCHES THROUGHOUT THE EVENT. 
WV IMAGERY ALSO SHOWING STRONG WAVE MOVING DOWN THE WEST COAST. 
FEATURE WILL EVENTUALLY CLOSE OFF INTO AN UPPER LOW OVER THE FOUR 
CORNERS WITH POSITIVELY TILTED TROF EXTENDING NORTHEAST FROM IT. 
ENTIRE SYSTEM IS FORECAST TO MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES AND 
EVENTUALLY INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. SYSTEM WILL BE SHEARING OUT THE 
WHOLE TIME WITH MAIN ENERGY PASSING WELL TO THE NORTH AND THE 
TRAILING END OF THE WEAKENING TROF AXIS MOVING OVER THE CWA TUESDAY 
NIGHT.

SURFACE LOW ALREADY STARTING TO SPIN UP OVER THE CENTRAL ROCKIES AND 
EXPECTED TO BE OVER SOUTHWEST OKLAHOMA BY MONDAY MORNING. WILL TAPER 
BACK THE POPS SOMEWHAT TONIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LOW LEVEL DRY AIR. 
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY WITH INVERTED SURFACE TROF OVER THE AREA 
MONDAY. NOW EXPECTING AREA WIDE RAIN BY MID MORNING WHICH WILL 
CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY AS SURFACE LOW CRAWLS TO THE EAST. RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE OVERLY EXCESSIVE BUT A GENERAL 2 INCH 
RAINFALL SEEMS LIKELY. WIDESPREAD CONVECTION DOES NOT APPEAR LIKELY 
BUT SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY IS NOTED. COULD BE SOME LOCALLY 
HEAVIER AMOUNTS WITH GOOD LOW LEVEL FORCING.

SURFACE LOW PROGGED TO BE OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS EARLY TUESDAY WITH 
INVERTED TROF BEING SHUNTED INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. STILL PLENTY 
OF MOISTURE THROUGH LATE TUESDAY BUT RAIN SHOULD BEGIN TO BREAK UP 
OVER THE NORTHWEST LATE WITH MODELS NOW QUICKER MOVING THE SYSTEM 
OUT. WILL END STEADY RAIN OVER THE NORTHWEST LATE TUESDAY AND AREA 
WIDE BY MIDNIGHT WEDNESDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
EXPANDS EASTWARD.

REALLY NO COLD AIR IN SIGHT UNTIL AFTER THE TROF AXIS PASSES AND BY 
EVEN THEN MOISTURE IS LONG GONE. EVENT WILL BE ALL LIQUID ACROSS THE 
CWA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE END OF 
THE PERIOD FOR DRY CONDITIONS. TEMPERATURES WILL AVERAGE CLOSE TO 
NORMAL ALTHOUGH EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND RAIN WILL KEEP TEMPS DOWN 
EARLY IN THE PERIOD. WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FWC/MAV NUMBERS THIS 
AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
ASIDE FROM A WEAK SHORTWAVE WHICH COULD POSSIBLY BRING ABOUT A BRIEF

CURRENT OBSERVATIONS. TEMPERATURES IN THE NORTH AND WEST FELL 
QUICKLY THIS EVENING SINCE THE WINDS HAVE SETTLED DOWN IN THOSE 
AREAS. HIGH PRESSURE IS CURRENTLY CENTERED OVER EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND 
WILL MOVE EAST INTO ARKANSAS TONIGHT. THIS WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY 
CLEAR OVERNIGHT. SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW CLOUDS TRYING TO MOVE INTO 
ARKANSAS BUT ARE DISSIPATING ONCE THEY ENCOUNTER THE AREA OF HIGH

MODELS CONTINUE THEIR RECENT ADVERTISEMENT OF A VERY ACTIVE SOUTHERN 
STREAM AND A POSSIBLE SIGNIFICANT RAIN EVENT FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK AS 
THE SOUTHWEST UPPER LOW KICKS OUT. ALL THE MODELS ARE TRENDING 
FASTER WITH THIS SYSTEM WITH THE ETA THE QUICKEST. GFS NOT AS QUICK 
EITHER BUT IT IS ALSO THE STRONGER SOLUTION. I STILL FEEL IT MAY BE 
A TAD UNDERDONE WITH GOOD OVERRRUNING PATTERN DEVELOPING IN SPITE OF 
THE MODEL QPFS BACKING OFF SOMEWHAT. STILL FEEL LIKE THE GFS IS THE 
WAY TO GO AND WILL LEAN IN ITS DIRECTION.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH AROUND 
LUNCH TIME THIS AFTERNOON WELL EAST OF THE AREA. COLD AIR ADVECTION 
PATTERN PREVENTED TEMPERATURES FROM RISING VERY MUCH. GUSTY 
NORTHWEST WINDS WILL SLOWLY DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET. CURRENT LAKE WIND 
ADVISORY SET TO EXPIRE AT 6 PM AND SEE NO REASON TO EXTEND IT.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE REGION OVERNIGHT BRINGING CLEAR 
SKIES AND CHILLY READINGS. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL NOT BOTTOM OUT 
COMPLETELY AS MODELS BRING INCREASING MID TO HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE IN 
ADVANCE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. MOISTURE WILL NOT MAKE IT TO PARTS OF 
THE NORTH AND WIDESPREAD BELOW FREEZING TEMPS EXPECTED HERE.

WAVE THAT WILL EVENTUALLY CARVE OUT THE UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST 
CONUS CLEARLY SEEN ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SLIDING DOWN THE WEST 
COAST. WAVE EXPECTED TO DIVE UNDER THE WESTERN CONUS TROF AND CLOSE 
OFF THE UPPER LOW NEAR THE FOUR CORNERS BY EARLY MONDAY. SURFACE 
HIGH IN TOP OF US SUNDAY MORNING WILL MOVE TO THE EAST WITH SOUTHERLY
FLOW RETURNING. AS TROF BEGINS TO SHARPEN OUT WEST...WEAK RIDGING 
RETURNS OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS. WITH RESULTANT SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT...ABUNDANT MOISTURE SHOULD BE PULLED IN OVER THE AREA. WILL 
LEAVE PRECIPITATION OUT FOR SUNDAY.

SURFACE LOW SPINS UP OVER EASTERN NEW MEXICO LATE SUNDAY. WARM 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE WITH 
INVERTED SURFACE TROF IN PLACE BY MONDAY MORNING. WITH EVOLUTION OF 
SYSTEM FASTER...WILL INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
ADVANCE THEM EASTWARD OVERNIGHT. CATEGORICAL POPS AREA WIDE BY MID 
MORNING MONDAY. RAIN TO CONTINUE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH 
SURFACE LOW PASSING TO THE SOUTH OF THE STATE AND OVERRRUNING 
PATTERN CONTINUING. PLACEMENT OF THE PARENT LOW WOULD PRECLUDE MUCH 
IN THE WAY OF THUNDER AS WHAT INSTABILITY EXISTS IS ELEVATED. 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN A VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY THROUGH MID DAY TUESDAY 
AS PWATS INCREASE TO NEAR 2 INCHES WITH UPPER HIGH IN THE GULF 
PUMPING IN MOISTURE. SUSPECT FLASH FLOOD WATCHES ARE FORTH COMING. 

LOW AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT FINALLY MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
LATE TUESDAY. SOME DRIER AIR DOES TRIES TO MOVE INTO THE EXTREME 
NORTH LATE TUESDAY. DRY AIR MOVES SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT AND WILL TREND 
POPS DOWN THROUGH THE NIGHT...REMOVING IT FROM THE SOUTHEAST EARLY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.   

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...AFTER A PLEASANT DAY SUNDAY...ABUNDANT 
CLOUD COVER THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW 
NORMAL. UPPER LOW INITIALLY OVER THE SOUTHWEST EVOLVES INTO AN 
ELONGATED TROF THAT SWEEPS THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. COLDER AIR DOES 
COME BACK INTO THE AREA IN ITS WAKE BUT MOISTURE WILL BE LACKING AT

COAST. WAVE EXPECTED TO DIVE UNDER THE WESTERN CONUS TROF AND CLOSE 
OFF THE UPPER LOW NEAR THE FOUR CORNERS BY EARLY MONDAY. SURFACE 
HIGH IN TOP OF US SUNDAY MORNING WILL MOVE TO THE EAST WITH SOUTHERLY
FLOW RETURNING. AS TROF BEGINS TO SHARPEN OUT WEST...WEAK RIDGING 
RETURNS OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS. WITH RESULTANT SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT...ABUNDANT MOISTURE SHOULD BE PULLED IN OVER THE AREA. WILL 
LEAVE PRECIPITATION OUT FOR SUNDAY.

SURFACE LOW SPINS UP OVER EASTERN NEW MEXICO LATE SUNDAY. WARM 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE WITH 
INVERTED SURFACE TROF IN PLACE BY MONDAY MORNING. WITH EVOLUTION OF 
SYSTEM FASTER...WILL INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
ADVANCE THEM EASTWARD OVERNIGHT. CATEGORICAL POPS AREA WIDE BY MID 
MORNING MONDAY. RAIN TO CONTINUE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH 
SURFACE LOW PASSING TO THE SOUTH OF THE STATE AND OVERRRUNING 
PATTERN CONTINUING. PLACEMENT OF THE PARENT LOW WOULD PRECLUDE MUCH 
IN THE WAY OF THUNDER AS WHAT INSTABILITY EXISTS IS ELEVATED. 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN A VERY GOOD POSSIBILITY THROUGH MID DAY TUESDAY 
AS PWATS INCREASE TO NEAR 2 INCHES WITH UPPER HIGH IN THE GULF 
PUMPING IN MOISTURE. SUSPECT FLASH FLOOD WATCHES ARE FORTH COMING. 

LOW AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT FINALLY MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
LATE TUESDAY. SOME DRIER AIR DOES TRIES TO MOVE INTO THE EXTREME 
NORTH LATE TUESDAY. DRY AIR MOVES SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT AND WILL TREND 
POPS DOWN THROUGH THE NIGHT...REMOVING IT FROM THE SOUTHEAST EARLY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.   

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...AFTER A PLEASANT DAY SUNDAY...ABUNDANT 
CLOUD COVER THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW 
NORMAL. UPPER LOW INITIALLY OVER THE SOUTHWEST EVOLVES INTO AN 
ELONGATED TROF THAT SWEEPS THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. COLDER AIR DOES 
COME BACK INTO THE AREA IN ITS WAKE BUT MOISTURE WILL BE LACKING AT 
THAT TIME SO NO WINTERY PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED. WILL GO WITH A 
BLEND OF THE WARMER MAV NUMBERS AND THE COOLER FWC NUMBERS THIS 
AFTERNOON.   
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
BY EARLY THURSDAY...A DRY AIR MASS WILL PREVAIL STATEWIDE WITH A 
NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT...AND EVEN DRIER AIR OUT WEST HEADED TOWARDS 
ARKANSAS. BY FRIDAY NIGHT...AN AREA OF SOMEWHAT HIGHER MOISTURE 
MAKES IT INTO THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF ARKANSAS...WITH MOISTURE 
INCREASING BY SATURDAY MORNING OVER MAINLY THE SOUTHERN HALF...YET 
MEAN RH WILL STILL BE ON THE LOW SIDE. A SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BY 
LATE SUNDAY WILL BRING DRIER AIR INTO THE WESTERN SECTIONS. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL ON THURSDAY...FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

1010 AM CST SAT NOV 27 2004

.DISCUSSION...
UPDATE ON THE WAY THIS MORNING. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD 
FRONT JUST TO THE EAST OF THE METROPOLITAN AREA. WINDS HAVE SHIFTED 
TO THE NORTHWEST OVER THE WESTERN PART OF THE STATE AND ARE ALREADY 
INCREASING WITH TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT COMING IN. LAKE WIND 
ADVISORY WILL CONTINUE. 

JUST A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE FAR EASTERN PART OF THE CWA AND RAPIDLY 
MOVING EASTWARD. EXPECTING JUST A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS TO REMAIN 
THROUGH NOON AND THAT SHOULD TAKE CARE OF IT. SKIES REMAIN CLOUDY 
EXCEPT FOR A FEW BREAKS WITH CLEARING LINE JUST TO THE WEST OF THE 
STATE. LATEST MESO ETA CONTINUES TO SHOW CLEARING SKIES THIS 
AFTERNOON AS DRIER AIR WORKS EAST. 

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROBLEMATIC. TEMPERATURES ALREADY 
STARTING TO FALL OVER THE NORTHWEST AS COLD AIR ADVECTION PATTERN 
GETS ESTABLISHED. BELIEVE MOST AREAS HAVE ALREADY ACHIEVED THEIR 
DAYTIME MAXES AND WILL GO WITH SLOWLY FALLING OR STEADY TEMPS THE 
REST OF THE DAY.

OTHER UPDATES WILL BE TO CLEAN UP WORDING AND TREND POPS DOWNWARD. 
NEW SUITE OF PRODUCTS OUT SHORTLY.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...ISSUED AT 400 AM CST SAT NOV 27 2004

SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WIDESPREAD THIS MORNING...BUT WILL BE CONFINED 
TO NORTHERN/EASTERN ARKANSAS TOWARD DAWN AND WILL EXIT THE STATE TO 
EAST BY LUNCHTIME. SOME SMALL HAIL STILL POSSIBLE WITH STORMS THIS 
MORNING...WITH LOW WET BULB ZERO LEVELS. 

STORM SYSTEM WILL DRAG COLD FRONT THROUGH ARKANSAS THIS 
MORNING...WITH GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS TO FOLLOW THIS AFTERNOON. WILL 
ISSUE LAKE WIND ADVISORY FOR ENTIRE COUNTY WARNING AREA AS A 
RESULT. 

SKY WILL CLEAR THIS AFTERNOON...WITH WINDS DIMINISHING TONIGHT AND 
COOLER TEMPERATURES NOTED. BELOW FREEZING TEMPERATURES TONIGHT IN 
PARTS OF THE NORTH/WEST...BUT WIDESPREAD FREEZE NOT 
ANTICIPATED.

FOR THE REST OF THE SHORT TERM...SUNDAY WILL START OFF 
TRANQUIL...BUT A NEW STORM SYSTEM WILL APPROACH FROM THE PLAINS. 
APPEARS THAT CLOUDS WILL INCREASE SUNDAY AFTERNOON...WITH RAIN 
BECOMING LIKELY IN WESTERN ARKANSAS SUNDAY NIGHT. 

RAIN IN THE FORECAST IN MUCH OF THE STATE MONDAY/TUESDAY. LOOKS LIKE 
TRACK OF STORM SYSTEM WILL BE MAINLY SOUTH OF THE REGION...KEEPING 
ARKANSAS COOL WITH THUNDER MAINLY CONFINED TO GULF COAST REGION. 
(46)            

HAVE MADE A FEW UPDATES TO FORECASTS IN THIS PERIOD...MAINLY TO

POPS WILL DECREASE RAPIDLY. THIRDLY...WINDS WILL BE A FACTOR. BREEZY

VORTICITY ADVECTION TO MOST OF MY CW AREA BY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. THE 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE HAS BEEN INCREASING OVER THE REGION SINCE THIS 
MORNING. A WELL DEFINED SURFACE BASED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE 
CENTERED OVER SOUTHEASTERN KANSAS BY MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...WITH A GOOD 
SOUTHERLY FETCH OF GULF OF MEXICO MOISTURE INTO ARKANSAS. WILL 
THEREFORE KEEP A MENTION OF SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT. SOME STORMS MAY BECOME SEVERE...MAINLY IN THE 
SOUTH. A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION LATE 
SATURDAY MORNING. A SECOND AND MORE IMPRESSIVE STORM SYSTEM MOVES IN 
LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. THE GFS TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE APPEARS REASONABLE 
SO WILL NOT VENTURE TOO FAR FROM THESE.(38)      

RELATIVELY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. GFS SOLUTION CONTINUES TO

ISSUES. WITH NO REAL DIFFERENCES OF NOTE...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF 
FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE GFS. EVEN 
GFS HAS COME BACK CONSIDERABLY WETTER FOR WEDNESDAY VERSUS PREVIOUS 
RUNS. SOLUTION SUPPORTED BY OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AS WELL.

SURFACE LOW SOUTH OF LAKE MICHIGAN AND COLD FRONT ALREADY IN THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. WITH MAIN TROF AXIS OVER STILL OVER EASTERN 
OKLAHOMA AND PLENTY OF RESIDUAL MOISTURE..WILL STILL HAVE TO HOLD

DOMINATE FOR DAYS SIX AND SEVEN WITH DRY CONDITIONS. SOME MOISTURE 
TRIES TO SNEAK INTO THE SOUTH LATE ON DAY SEVEN BUT WILL NOT 
INTRODUCE ANY POPS AT THIS POINT.  

BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED WEDNESDAY WITH ABUNDANT EARLY 
MORNING CLOUD COVER AND NORTHWEST WINDS. TEMPERATURES MODERATE ON 
THURSDAY AND EVEN MORE SO FRIDAY AS SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL RETURN ON 
THE BACK SIDE OF THE HIGH AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST CONUS.

.DISCUSSION...
ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST 
ARKANSAS. HAVE MADE SEVERAL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GRIDS. 
FIRST...INCREASED TEMPERATURES BASED ON CURRENT OBSERVATIONS AS 
TEMPERATURES WERE RISING IN THE WESTERN PART OF THE STATE WITH 
STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION. THEREFORE...INCREASED LOW TEMPERATURES 
TONIGHT A COUPLE OF DEGREES. SATELLITE SHOWS ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER 
AND MORE TO COME AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING FRONT...WHICH WAS ACROSS 
CENTRAL OKLAHOMA. THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE RAPIDLY EASTWARD. 
AS IT DOES SO...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP 
ACROSS THE AREA. SO SECONDLY...INCREASED POPS IN THE WEST A BIT FOR 
OVERNIGHT. A FEW OF THE STORMS COULD REACH SEVERE LIMITS TONIGHT. 
TOMORROWS POPS LOOK GOOD AS THE FRONT WILL MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH AND 
POPS WILL DECREASE RAPIDLY. THIRDLY...WINDS WILL BE A FACTOR. BREEZY 
10 TO 20 MPH WINDS ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT...AND SHOULD BE HIGHER FOR

MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WERE NOTED ACROSS THE STATE TONIGHT ON THE LATEST 
SATELLITE IMAGERY. CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY INCREASE AS THE 
NEXT COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. ADJUSTED LOW 
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT A BIT. FEEL COOLEST TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE 
EAST AND WARMEST TEMPERATURES IN THE WEST AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES TO 
THE EAST. STRONGER WINDS IN THE WEST WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES UP 
OVERNIGHT. CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL BEGIN TOMORROW NIGHT AHEAD 
OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT.  
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 212 PM CST THU NOV 25 2004

THE TIMING OF THE NEXT PRECIPITATION EPISODE TO AFFECT ARKANSAS IS 
BEST HANDLED BY THE 20 KM RUC...SO WILL LEAN MORE IN THIS DIRECTION 
WITH ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR OROGRAPHIC AFFECTS. HIGH 
PRESSURE NOW OVER US WILL BE MOVING EASTWARD TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. BY 
FRIDAY NIGHT...A SURFACE BASED LOW WILL BE MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST KANSAS. A TROUGH WILL EXTEND FROM THIS LOW INTO 
SOUTH TEXAS. A COLD FRONT WILL EXTEND FROM THE KANSAS LOW TO 
MINNESOTA. AHEAD OF THIS APPROACHING SYSTEM...A SOUTHERLY WIND WILL 
BRING ADDITIONAL MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO TO COMBINE WITH A 
MOIST UNSTABLE AIR MASS MOVING TOWARDS ARKANSAS FROM THE NORTH. THIS 
WILL TRIGGER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
OVER THE NORTHERN SECTIONS FRIDAY NIGHT AND THEN WILL SPREAD TO THE 
REST OF THE CW AREA. THE SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL ALSO PUSH TEMPERATURES 
BACK UP ABOVE NORMAL OVER MOST OF ARKANSAS. WILL GO AHEAD AND 
INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY NIGHT IN ORDER 
TO BETTER MESH WITH THE NEW AND IMPROVED GUIDANCE.

RELATIVELY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. GFS SOLUTION CONTINUES TO 
BE THE MOST CONSISTENT ALTHOUGH EVEN IT IS HAVING A FEW TIMING 
ISSUES. WITH NO REAL DIFFERENCES OF NOTE...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF 
FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE GFS.

VERY ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD. NEXT 
IN WHAT SEEMS A NEVER ENDING SERIES OF UPPER LOWS DROPS INTO THE 
SOUTHWEST CONUS AND LIFTS OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY. UPPER LOW WILL BE OVER 
EASTERN COLORADO AT THE ONSET OF THE PERIOD WITH DEEPENING SURFACE 
LOW OVER CENTRAL TEXAS. HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST 
WILL KEEP PLENTY OF GULF MOISTURE FLOWING INTO THE DEVELOPING LOW. 
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE LOCATED JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE STATE 
SETTING THE STAGE FOR OVERRUNNING RAINS TUESDAY BUT AREA APPEARS TO 
BE DRY SLOTTED LATE. TROF AXIS PASSES OVER THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. 

REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED LOOKS DRY AT THIS POINT WITH SURFACE HIGH 
STARTING TO SLIDE DOWN THE ROCKIES. ANOTHER LOW FORMS IN THE GULF 
LATE IN THE PERIOD BUT MOISTURE DOES NOT RETURN UNTIL BEYOND THE 
MEDIUM RANGE. WILL HAVE TO WATCH THIS TO SEE IF SYSTEM DEVELOPS 
QUICKER THAN CURRENTLY BEING ADVERTISED. MAV TEMPERATURES LOOK 
REASONABLE AND PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH CURRENT FORECAST. WILL MAKE 
VERY FEW CHANGES HERE AND OVERALL TEMPS WILL AVERAGE A FEW DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL.

THE EAST. STRONGER WINDS IN THE WEST WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES UP 
OVERNIGHT. CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL BEGIN TOMORROW NIGHT AHEAD 
OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT.

ISSUED AT 212 PM CST THU NOV 25 2004

THE TIMING OF THE NEXT PRECIPITATION EPISODE TO AFFECT ARKANSAS IS 
BEST HANDLED BY THE 20 KM RUC...SO WILL LEAN MORE IN THIS DIRECTION 
WITH ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO ACCOUNT FOR OROGRAPHIC AFFECTS. HIGH 
PRESSURE NOW OVER US WILL BE MOVING EASTWARD TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. BY 
FRIDAY NIGHT...A SURFACE BASED LOW WILL BE MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST KANSAS. A TROUGH WILL EXTEND FROM THIS LOW INTO 
SOUTH TEXAS. A COLD FRONT WILL EXTEND FROM THE KANSAS LOW TO 
MINNESOTA. AHEAD OF THIS APPROACHING SYSTEM...A SOUTHERLY WIND WILL 
BRING ADDITIONAL MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO TO COMBINE WITH A 
MOIST UNSTABLE AIR MASS MOVING TOWARDS ARKANSAS FROM THE NORTH. THIS 
WILL TRIGGER THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
OVER THE NORTHERN SECTIONS FRIDAY NIGHT AND THEN WILL SPREAD TO THE 
REST OF THE CW AREA. THE SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL ALSO PUSH TEMPERATURES 
BACK UP ABOVE NORMAL OVER MOST OF ARKANSAS. WILL GO AHEAD AND 
INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY NIGHT IN ORDER 
TO BETTER MESH WITH THE NEW AND IMPROVED GUIDANCE.

RELATIVELY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. GFS SOLUTION CONTINUES TO 
BE THE MOST CONSISTENT ALTHOUGH EVEN IT IS HAVING A FEW TIMING 
ISSUES. WITH NO REAL DIFFERENCES OF NOTE...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF 
FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE GFS.

VERY ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD. NEXT 
IN WHAT SEEMS A NEVER ENDING SERIES OF UPPER LOWS DROPS INTO THE 
SOUTHWEST CONUS AND LIFTS OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY. UPPER LOW WILL BE OVER 
EASTERN COLORADO AT THE ONSET OF THE PERIOD WITH DEEPENING SURFACE 
LOW OVER CENTRAL TEXAS. HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST 
WILL KEEP PLENTY OF GULF MOISTURE FLOWING INTO THE DEVELOPING LOW. 
WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE LOCATED JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE STATE 
SETTING THE STAGE FOR OVERRUNNING RAINS TUESDAY BUT AREA APPEARS TO 
BE DRY SLOTTED LATE. TROF AXIS PASSES OVER THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. 

REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED LOOKS DRY AT THIS POINT WITH SURFACE HIGH 
STARTING TO SLIDE DOWN THE ROCKIES. ANOTHER LOW FORMS IN THE GULF 
LATE IN THE PERIOD BUT MOISTURE DOES NOT RETURN UNTIL BEYOND THE 
MEDIUM RANGE. WILL HAVE TO WATCH THIS TO SEE IF SYSTEM DEVELOPS 
QUICKER THAN CURRENTLY BEING ADVERTISED. MAV TEMPERATURES LOOK 
REASONABLE AND PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH CURRENT FORECAST. WILL MAKE 
VERY FEW CHANGES HERE AND OVERALL TEMPS WILL AVERAGE A FEW DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...CORRECTED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
1006 PM CST WED NOV 24 2004

.DISCUSSION...
WILL ISSUE UPDATE TO FORECAST MAINLY FOR WORDING. TEMPERATURES LOOK 
TO BE ON TRACK FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD. ADJUSTED GRID TEMPERATURES 
SLIGHTLY BASED ON CURRENT OBSERVATIONS. SKIES WILL CONTINUE TO CLEAR 
OUT TONIGHT AND TEMPERATURES WILL DROP A BIT MORE RAPIDLY AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. WILL ADD A FEW MORE COUNTIES TO THE FREEZE WARNING. LIGHT 
PRECIPITATION NOTED EARLY THIS EVENING ON KLZK RADAR HAS MOVED EAST 
OF THE AREA. 
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 224 PM WED NOV 24 2004

WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO DISSIPATE THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS ACROSS 
THE AREA. THEREFORE THE LAKE WIND ADVISORY HAS BEEN ALLOWED TO 
EXPIRE. SATELLITE IMAGES SHOWED THE CLEARING LINE NEAR THE OKLAHOMA 
BORDER AND CONTINUING TO MOVE EAST. MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THIS EVENING 
WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR BY MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO 
MOVE EAST. 

ISSUED AT 224 PM WED NOV 24 2004

SHORT RANGE MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. GFS AND 
ETA BOTH ON THE SAME PAGE REGARDING THE EXITING UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER 
THE NATIONS MID SECTION. WITH NO REAL DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE 
MODELS...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES RAPIDLY DEEPENING SURFACE LOW OVER 
SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND RACING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. SYSTEM FASTER AND 
STRONGER THAN MODELS WERE EARLIER SHOWING. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT HAS 
EXITED THE STATE WITH STRING COLD AIR ADVECTION PATTERN UNDERWAY.  
HIGH TEMPERATURES ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA WERE ACHIEVED EARLY IN THE 
DAY WITH STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.

TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE DEPARTING LOW AND BUILDING HIGH 
NOW OVER WESTERN TEXAS WILL SLOWLY SLACKEN THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. 
LAKE WIND ADVISORY CURRENTLY IN EFFECT WILL NOT BE EXPANDED BEYOND 
THAT TIME.

TROF AXIS STILL HAS TO PASS THROUGH THE REGION LATE THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EARLY THIS EVENING. UNTIL ACTUALLY AXIS CLEARS...A FEW SCATTERED 
SHOWERS CAN NOT BE RULED OUT. A FEW WET FLAKES ALSO ARE POSSIBLE 
ESPECIALLY AT ELEVATION BUT NOT ENOUGH TO WORTH MENTIONING IN THE 
FORECAST AT THIS TIME.

COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON TO DATE CONTINUES TO POUR INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE NORTHWEST. MODELS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE CLEARING SKIES 
OVERNIGHT AND WITH DECOUPLING WINDS...VERY COLD OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE 
EXPECTED. CURRENT PLACEMENT OF FREEZE ADVISORY LOOKS GOOD. REMAINDER 
OF THE CWA WILL DROP INTO THE MID 30S. 

AFOREMENTIONED HIGH WILL SLIDE ALONG THE GULF COAST ON THANKSGIVING 
DAY. SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL RETURN LATE IN THE DAY AS THE HIGH SLIPS 
TO THE EAST OF THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE ABOUT 5 TO 10 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL BUT SOUTHERLY COMPONENT WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES 
FROM BOTTOMING OUT ONCE AGAIN FRIDAY MORNING.

FLOW ON FRIDAY STARTS OFF ZONAL AND BECOMES MORE SOUTHWEST DURING 
THE DAY AS NEXT TROUGH DIGS INTO THE NATIONS MID SECTION. SOUTHERLY 
SURFACE COMPONENT WILL BRING WARMER DAYTIME MAXES. FWC NUMBERS SEEM 
A LITTLE HIGH AND WILL GO CLOSER TO THE MAV NUMBERS. 

NEXT TROUGH PASSES OVER THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY. 
PARENT LOW IS WELL TO THE NORTH BUT MODELS CONSISTENT WITH SECONDARY 
DEVELOPMENT ON THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT.  LOW WOULD FORM OVER 
NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA FRIDAY EVENING AND MOVE INTO EASTERN MISSOURI BY 
SATURDAY MORNING. DYNAMICS NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE BUT ENOUGH 
MOISTURE RETURN AND SURFACE CONVERGENCE WARRANTS SCATTERED POPS. 

SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH QUICKLY SATURDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE ON THE 
SURFACE AND ZONAL FLOW ALOFT RETURNING FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY. NEXT SYSTEM STARTS TO APPROACH THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT WITH 
MOISTURE INCREASING. WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY PRECIPITATION IN THE 
SUNDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME AT THIS TIME.  

WILL GO WITH THE PREFERRED GFSLR MODEL. HAD TO ADJUST A FEW MAX AND 
MINS DOWNWARD SINCE NEW THINKING IS LEANING THAT WAY. THERE WILL BE 
A ZONAL UPPER LEVEL FLOW WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MEAN RH EARLY IN 
THE PERIOD. AN AREA OF SOMEWHAT HIGHER MOISTURE IS HOWEVER AT THAT 
TIME EXPECTED TO BE MOVING ACROSS OKLAHOMA TOWARDS ARKANSAS. BY 
MONDAY MORNING...A CUT-OFF H5 LOW HAS DEVELOPED AND DROPPED

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES RAPIDLY DEEPENING SURFACE LOW OVER 
SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND RACING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. SYSTEM FASTER AND 
STRONGER THAN MODELS WERE EARLIER SHOWING. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT HAS 
EXITED THE STATE WITH STRING COLD AIR ADVECTION PATTERN UNDERWAY.  
HIGH TEMPERATURES ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA WERE ACHIEVED EARLY IN THE

COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON TO DATE CONTINUES TO POUR INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE NORTHWEST. MODELS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE CLEARING SKIES 
OVERNIGHT AND WITH DECOUPLING WINDS...VERY COLD OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE 
EXPECTED. CURRENT PLACEMENT OF FREEZE ADVISORY LOOKS GOOD. REMAINDER 
OF THE CWA WILL DROP INTO THE MID 30S. 

AFOREMENTIONED HIGH WILL SLIDE ALONG THE GULF COAST ON THANKSGIVING 
DAY. SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL RETURN LATE IN THE DAY AS THE HIGH SLIPS

THE DAY AS NEXT TROUGH DIGS INTO THE NATIONS MID SECTION. SOUTHERLY 
SURFACE COMPONENT WILL BRING WARMER DAYTIME MAXES. FWC NUMBERS SEEM 
A LITTLE HIGH AND WILL GO CLOSER TO THE MAV NUMBERS. 

NEXT TROUGH PASSES OVER THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY. 
PARENT LOW IS WELL TO THE NORTH BUT MODELS CONSISTENT WITH SECONDARY 
DEVELOPMENT ON THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT.  LOW WOULD FORM OVER 
NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA FRIDAY EVENING AND MOVE INTO EASTERN MISSOURI BY 
SATURDAY MORNING. DYNAMICS NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE BUT ENOUGH

SHORT RANGE MODELS ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. GFS AND 
ETA BOTH ON THE SAME PAGE REGARDING THE EXITING UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER 
THE NATIONS MID SECTION. WITH NO REAL DISCREPANCIES BETWEEN THE 
MODELS...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES RAPIDLY DEEPENING SURFACE LOW OVER 
SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND RACING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. SYSTEM FASTER AND 
STRONGER THAN MODELS WERE EARLIER SHOWING. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT HAS 
EXITED THE STATE WITH STRING COLD AIR ADVECTION PATTERN UNDERWAY.  
HIGH TEMPERATURES ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA WERE ACHIEVED EARLY IN THE 
DAY WITH STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.

TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE DEPARTING LOW AND BUILDING HIGH 
NOW OVER WESTERN TEXAS WILL SLOWLY SLACKEN THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. 
LAKE WIND ADVISORY CURRENTLY IN EFFECT WILL NOT BE EXPANDED BEYOND 
THAT TIME.

TROF AXIS STILL HAS TO PASS THROUGH THE REGION LATE THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EARLY THIS EVENING. UNTIL ACTUALLY AXIS CLEARS...A FEW SCATTERED 
SHOWERS CAN NOT BE RULED OUT. A FEW WET FLAKES ALSO ARE POSSIBLE 
ESPECIALLY AT ELEVATION BUT NOT ENOUGH TO WORTH MENTIONING IN THE 
FORECAST AT THIS TIME.

COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON TO DATE CONTINUES TO POUR INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE NORTHWEST. MODELS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE CLEARING SKIES 
OVERNIGHT AND WITH DECOUPLING WINDS...VERY COLD OVERNIGHT LOWS ARE 
EXPECTED. CURRENT PLACEMENT OF FREEZE ADVISORY LOOKS GOOD. REMAINDER 
OF THE CWA WILL DROP INTO THE MID 30S. 

AFOREMENTIONED HIGH WILL SLIDE ALONG THE GULF COAST ON THANKSGIVING 
DAY. SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL RETURN LATE IN THE DAY AS THE HIGH SLIPS 
TO THE EAST OF THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE ABOUT 5 TO 10 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL BUT SOUTHERLY COMPONENT WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES 
FROM BOTTOMING OUT ONCE AGAIN FRIDAY MORNING.

FLOW ON FRIDAY STARTS OFF ZONAL AND BECOMES MORE SOUTHWEST DURING 
THE DAY AS NEXT TROUGH DIGS INTO THE NATIONS MID SECTION. SOUTHERLY 
SURFACE COMPONENT WILL BRING WARMER DAYTIME MAXES. FWC NUMBERS SEEM 
A LITTLE HIGH AND WILL GO CLOSER TO THE MAV NUMBERS. 

NEXT TROUGH PASSES OVER THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY. 
PARENT LOW IS WELL TO THE NORTH BUT MODELS CONSISTENT WITH SECONDARY 
DEVELOPMENT ON THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT.  LOW WOULD FORM OVER 
NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA FRIDAY EVENING AND MOVE INTO EASTERN MISSOURI BY 
SATURDAY MORNING. DYNAMICS NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE BUT ENOUGH 
MOISTURE RETURN AND SURFACE CONVERGENCE WARRANTS SCATTERED POPS. 

SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH QUICKLY SATURDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE ON THE 
SURFACE AND ZONAL FLOW ALOFT RETURNING FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY. NEXT SYSTEM STARTS TO APPROACH THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT WITH 
MOISTURE INCREASING. WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY PRECIPITATION IN THE 
SUNDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME AT THIS TIME.  

WILL GO WITH THE PREFERRED GFSLR MODEL. HAD TO ADJUST A FEW MAX AND 
MINS DOWNWARD SINCE NEW THINKING IS LEANING THAT WAY. THERE WILL BE 
A ZONAL UPPER LEVEL FLOW WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MEAN RH EARLY IN 
THE PERIOD. AN AREA OF SOMEWHAT HIGHER MOISTURE IS HOWEVER AT THAT 
TIME EXPECTED TO BE MOVING ACROSS OKLAHOMA TOWARDS ARKANSAS. BY 
MONDAY MORNING...A CUT-OFF H5 LOW HAS DEVELOPED AND DROPPED 
SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE FOUR CORNERS REGION...WITH UPPER FLOW OVER 
ARKANSAS NOW BECOMING MORE OF A SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST FLOW. THE 
HIGHER MOISTURE IS NOW MAINLY CONCENTRATED OVER THE NORTHWESTERN 
SECTIONS OF ARKANSAS. A DRIER AIRMASS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION BY 
TUESDAY. NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL PREVAIL SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY...WITH COOLER THAN NORMAL WEATHER EXPECTED BY TUESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
FORECAST IS FAIRLY ON TRACK THIS MORNING. THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
THAT BROUGHT SEVERAL INCHES OF RAIN TO THE STATE IS QUICKLY MOVING 
OUT OF THE AREA. AT 16Z...THE CENTER OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WAS 
LOCATED OVER S IL. STRONG PRESSURE COUPLET OF 8 PLUS MB WITH THE 
SYSTEM IS ALSO BLASTING THROUGH THE STATE. LOCAL WSR-88DS SHOWING 
THE RAIN/SNOW BAND ACROSS MO/OK SUBSIDING OVER THE LAST HOUR...AS 
DRY AIR WORKS INTO THE AREA AND MUCH OF THE FORCING EXITS 
EASTWARD...WHICH IS DEPICTED NICELY IN THE 12Z ETA. A SECONDARY 
COLD FRONT IS ALSO SHOWING UP IN THE WIND FIELDS. AM SLIGHTLY 
CONCERNED WITH THIS FEATURE TOUCHING OFF A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
STATE AS IT MOVES THROUGH...AS ANY SUNSHINE ALONG WITH COOLING TEMPS 
IN THE MID LAYERS WOULD LEAD TO SLIGHT DESTABILIZATION OF THE PBL. 
CLOUD COVER IS RATHER EXTENSIVE THOUGH...AND WITH STRONG CAA BEHIND 
THE SYSTEM QUICKLY MOISTENING THE LOW LAYERS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE...DONT FEEL LIKE MANY BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS WILL BE 
REALIZED. ALTHOUGH WINDS ARE GUSTING INTO THE MID AND UPPER 20S 
ACROSS THE STATE...I DONT EXPECT THEM TO CONTINUE AS THE 
AFOREMENTIONED PRESSURE COUPLET RAPIDLY VACATES. TEMPS ARE ON TRACK 
FOR THE DAY...AS IS REST OF FORECAST AT THIS TIME.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 406 AM CST WED NOV 24 2004

THE H5 LOW WEAKENED AND OPENED SOONER THAN EXPECTED. IT WILL SLIDE 
OFF TO THE NORTHEAST FASTER...SO THIS WILL HAVE THE RESULT OF ENDING 
PRECIPITATION OVER THE STATE QUICKER. THERE WILL BE SOME WRAP AROUND 
CLOUDS AND RAIN CHANCES...BUT THEY WILL END BY 00Z THU. A FAST ZONAL 
FLOW WILL SET UP ONCE THIS TROF MOVES OUT OF THE WAY. THE NEXT SHORT 
WAVE TO APPROACH THE STATE FROM THE WEST WILL BRING POPS BACK INTO 
THE FORECAST FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THE STRONG COLD FRONT 
WILL BRING WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS TODAY...BUT THEY WILL NOT BE 
QUITE AS GUSTY AS THEY HAD BEEN SHOWN WITH PREVIOUS RUNS...SO THERE 
WILL BE NO NEED FOR LAKE WIND ADVISORIES AT THIS TIME. COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WILL BE STRONG...SO A FREEZE WARNING FOR MY NORTHERN AND 
WEST CENTRAL COUNTIES WILL BE ISSUED. MOISTURE WILL BE LEAVING OUR 
FORECAST AREA BEFORE THE COLD AIR ARRIVES...SO IT APPEARS WE WILL 
MISS AN ENCOUNTER WITH WINTRY PRECIPITATION THIS ROUND. TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE QUITE COLD BY THURSDAY MORNING ON ACCOUNT OF THE STRONG 
FRONT...BUT RETURN FLOW WILL SET UP RATHER QUICKLY...LOWS THURSDAY 
NIGHT WILL BENEFIT FROM A SOUTHERLY FETCH. HIGHS FRIDAY WILL BENEFIT 
FROM THE SAME SOUTHERLY WINDS.

HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH SHORT TERM WEATHER AND COULD NOT GIVE GOOD 
ATTENTION TO THE EXTENDED. THUS LITTLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS MADE. 
LOOKS LIKE NEXT UPPER TROF AND FRONT WILL BE PAST THE AREA BY 
SATURDAY NIGHT SO CONTINUED DRY FORECAST FOR THEN. THE NEXT TROF AND 
COLD FRONT APPROACH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WITH THE FRONT MOVING 
THROUGH ON TUESDAY. UPSLOPE PATTERN BEGINS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT 
WHICH WILL AFFECT AREAS WEST OF THE CWA THEN A WEAK SHORT WAVE ALONG 
THE GULF COAST BRINGS MOISTURE INTO THE AREA FOR MONDAY. PUT CHANCE 
POPS IN FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. GFS PATTERN FOR NEXT TUESDAY 
LOOKS SIMILAR TO PATTERN OF THIS TUESDAY...BUT UPPER LOW IS PROGGED 
TO COME OUT FARTHER TO THE NORTH AND THE AIR IN PLACE LOOKS COOLER 
TO START WITH. WITH THE DYNAMICS MOVING NORTH AND THE AIR LESS 
UNSTABLE...SEVERE WEATHER THREAT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD AT THIS 
TIME...BUT WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS UNFOLDS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
DID NOT FORECAST THUNDER WITH THE SYSTEM FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK FOR NOW.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
406 AM CST WED NOV 24 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY
THE H5 LOW WEAKENED AND OPENED SOONER THAN EXPECTED. IT WILL SLIDE 
OFF TO THE NORTHEAST FASTER...SO THIS WILL HAVE THE RESULT OF ENDING 
PRECIPITATION OVER THE STATE QUICKER. THERE WILL BE SOME WRAP AROUND 
CLOUDS AND RAIN CHANCES...BUT THEY WILL END BY 00Z THU. A FAST ZONAL 
FLOW WILL SET UP ONCE THIS TROF MOVES OUT OF THE WAY. THE NEXT SHORT 
WAVE TO APPROACH THE STATE FROM THE WEST WILL BRING POPS BACK INTO 
THE FORECAST FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THE STRONG COLD FRONT 
WILL BRING WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS TODAY...BUT THEY WILL NOT BE 
QUITE AS GUSTY AS THEY HAD BEEN SHOWN WITH PREVIOUS RUNS...SO THERE 
WILL BE NO NEED FOR LAKE WIND ADVISORIES AT THIS TIME. COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WILL BE STRONG...SO A FREEZE WARNING FOR MY NORTHERN AND 
WEST CENTRAL COUNTIES WILL BE ISSUED. MOISTURE WILL BE LEAVING OUR 
FORECAST AREA BEFORE THE COLD AIR ARRIVES...SO IT APPEARS WE WILL 
MISS AN ENCOUNTER WITH WINTRY PRECIPITATION THIS ROUND. TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE QUITE COLD BY THURSDAY MORNING ON ACCOUNT OF THE STRONG 
FRONT...BUT RETURN FLOW WILL SET UP RATHER QUICKLY...LOWS THURSDAY 
NIGHT WILL BENEFIT FROM A SOUTHERLY FETCH. HIGHS FRIDAY WILL BENEFIT 
FROM THE SAME SOUTHERLY WINDS.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
HAVE BEEN BUSY WITH SHORT TERM WEATHER AND COULD NOT GIVE GOOD 
ATTENTION TO THE EXTENDED. THUS LITTLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WAS MADE. 
LOOKS LIKE NEXT UPPER TROF AND FRONT WILL BE PAST THE AREA BY 
SATURDAY NIGHT SO CONTINUED DRY FORECAST FOR THEN. THE NEXT TROF AND 
COLD FRONT APPROACH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WITH THE FRONT MOVING 
THROUGH ON TUESDAY. UPSLOPE PATTERN BEGINS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT 
WHICH WILL AFFECT AREAS WEST OF THE CWA THEN A WEAK SHORT WAVE ALONG 
THE GULF COAST BRINGS MOISTURE INTO THE AREA FOR MONDAY. PUT CHANCE 
POPS IN FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. GFS PATTERN FOR NEXT TUESDAY 
LOOKS SIMILAR TO PATTERN OF THIS TUESDAY...BUT UPPER LOW IS PROGGED 
TO COME OUT FARTHER TO THE NORTH AND THE AIR IN PLACE LOOKS COOLER 
TO START WITH. WITH THE DYNAMICS MOVING NORTH AND THE AIR LESS 
UNSTABLE...SEVERE WEATHER THREAT DOES NOT LOOK GOOD AT THIS 
TIME...BUT WILL HAVE TO SEE HOW THIS UNFOLDS OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
DID NOT FORECAST THUNDER WITH THE SYSTEM FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK FOR NOW.

VERY HEAVY RAINFALL ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTHEASTERN 2/3 OF THE 
FORECAST AREA EARLIER TONIGHT. NEXT AREA OF RAINFALL OVER 
NORTHEASTERN TEXAS AND SOUTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA WILL AFFECT THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT. WITH SATURATED GROUND CONDITIONS...DECIDED TO ISSUE A 
FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR MUCH OF THE AREA FOR OVERNIGHT. AN ADDITIONAL 
INCH OR TWO OF RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE. FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY 
PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK WITH PRECIPITATION ENDING BY DAYS END. ALL 
UPDATES GONE.

ISSUED AT 234 PM CST TUE NOV 23 2004

SHORT TERM MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON 
WITH THE SYSTEM PULLING OUT OF THE SOUTHWEST CONUS. BIGGEST 
DISCREPANCY CONTINUES TO BE IN THE QPF FIELDS WITH GFS DEVELOPING A 
BULLS EYE OVER THE RWHILE THE OTHER MODELS NOT REALLY PICKING UP ON. 
WITH THE OTHER PARAMETERS BEING IN SUCH GOOD AGREEMENT WILL GO WITH 
A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY SLOWER ETA.

FIRST WAVE OF LIGHT RAIN ENDED EARLY TODAY WITH MAIN SHOW STARTING 
TO COME IN FROM THE WEST. DEEP CONVECTION FIRED UP OVER EASTERN 
TEXAS/OKLAHOMA EARLY IN AN AREA OF FAVORABLE DYNAMICS ON THE NOSE OF 
A HIGH LEVEL JET STREAK ROUNDING THE BASE OF THE SOUTHWEST CONUS 
TROUGH. PRECIPITATION AREA AS FAR EAST AS WEST CENTRAL ARKANSAS. 
FEATURE CLEARLY SEEN ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON SPINNING 
OVER THE NEW MEXICO/TEXAS BORDER...FAVORABLE DIVERGENT PATTERN ALSO 
SEEN ON WATER VAPOR CHANNEL.

CONVECTION FIRING UP ALONG A FRONTAL BOUNDARY STRETCHED OUT ACROSS 
EASTERN TEXAS. SURFACE LOW FORECAST TO DEVELOP IN NORTHEAST TEXAS 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND LIFT OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE MAIN UPPER 
SYSTEM. EXPECTING LINE OF STORMS TO SWEEP THROUGH THE CWA THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SOUTHERN HALF OF THE CWA UNDER A TORNADO 
WATCH UNTIL 03Z AND THIS SEEMS REASONABLE WITH A WARM FRONT IN THE 
VICINITY TO HELP WITH ADDITIONAL LIFT. SEVERE WEATHER ALREADY 
CONFIRMED IN MONTOGERMY COUNTY AT THIS TIME.

UPPER WAVE MOVES INTO EXTREME NORTHWEST ARKANSAS BY MORNING WITH 
TROF AXIS PASSING THROUGH LATER WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. SURFACE 
REFLECTION OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH 
CONSIDERABLE DRY SLOT OVER THE STATE. DRY SLOT FILLS IN RATHER 
QUICKLY THOUGH AS MOISTURE WRAPS AROUND THE BACKSIDE OF THE 
DEPARTING LOW. WILL TAPER OFF POPS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. RATHER TIGHT 
GRADIENT SPELLS A BREEZY DAY WITH COLD AIR ADVECTION PATTERN IN THE 
WAKE OF THE SYSTEM. TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY TO BE ESPECIALLY TRICKY 
WITH VERY LITTLE WARMING EXPECTED OVER THE NORTH AND MINIMAL WARMING 
ELSEWHERE. MAV NUMBERS RUNNING A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN THE FWC 
GUIDANCE AND APPEARS MORE REASONABLE AND AS SUCH WILL LEAN ITS WAY. 

HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GULF COAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THANKSGIVING DAY WITH CLEARING SKIES. TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
WILL FALL INTO THE UPPER 20S OVER THE NORTH. FREEZE WARNINGS MAY 
NEED TO BE HOISTED. HIGH MOVES OFF TO THE EAST BY LATE THURSDAY WITH 
SOUTHERLY SURFACE WINDS RETURNING LATE BUT COOL CONDITIONS STILL 
EXPECTED. WEAK WAVE MOVES THROUGH ON NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BUT 
MOISTURE IS LIMITED. 

ZONAL FLOW ALOFT FOR FRIDAY BUT ANOTHER DRY BUT COOL DAY. NEXT TROF 
APPROACHES FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. SYSTEM NOT NEARLY AS 
IMPRESSIVE AS STORM MOVING THROUGH NOW BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE AND 
DYNAMICS AROUND TO JUSTIFY SCATTERED POPS. TEMPERATURES TO REMAIN 
COOL.  

BY EARLY SUNDAY...THE PREFERRED GFSLR MODEL SHOWS ARKANSAS UNDER A 
NEARLY ZONAL UPPER LEVEL FLOW WITH A LIMITED AMOUNT OF MEAN RH. AN 
AREA OF SOMEWHAT HIGHER MOISTURE IS HOWEVER AT THAT TIME EXPECTED TO 
BE MOVING ACROSS OKLAHOMA TOWARDS ARKANSAS. BY MONDAY MORNING...A 
CUT-OFF H5 LOW HAS DEVELOPED AND DROPPED SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE FOUR 
CORNERS REGION...WITH UPPER FLOW OVER ARKANSAS NOW BECOMING MORE OF 
A SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST FLOW. THE HIGHER MOISTURE IS NOW MAINLY 
CONCENTRATED OVER THE NORTHWESTERN SECTIONS OF ARKANSAS. A DRIER 
AIRMASS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION BY TUESDAY. NEAR NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES WILL PREVAIL SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WITH COOLER THAN 
NORMAL WEATHER EXPECTED BY TUESDAY.

UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES WILL BE MOVING NORTHEAST AND 
OPENING UP AS IT GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE NORTHERN FLOW ALOFT BY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. THE SOUTHERN STREAM FEATURE WILL CONTINUE PHASING 
IN WITH THE NORTHERN STREAM AND IT WILL BE GETTING OUT OF OUR 
WEATHER PICTURE. ZONAL FLOW WILL RETURN IN THE WAKE OF THE LOW AND 
TROF. A SHORT WAVE WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE WEST BY FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON...BUT IT WILL NOT BRING ANY RAIN CHANCES UNTIL FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THE SURFACE PATTERN IS COMPLEX AND IT WILL BE THE FOCUS OF 
MOST OF OUR WEATHER IN THE NEXT DAY OR TWO. INITIALLY...WE WILL HAVE 
TO DEAL WITH THE CURRENT LOW CLOUDS...RAIN AND FOG. I WILL KEEP THE 
DENSE FOG ADVISORY THAT IS IN EFFECT ALREADY FOR THE ENTIRE CWA 
UNTIL MID MORNING (10A). SOME FOG MAY LINGER AFTER THAT TIME...BUT 
IT WILL NOT BE DENSE ENOUGH TO RESTRICT VISIBILITY TO ADVISORY 
CRITERION. TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN MOS 
NUMBERS SHOW IN LIGHT OF YESTERDAYS LACK OF WARMING WITH THE CLOUDS 
FOG AND DRIZZLE OR LIGHT RAIN. A COLD FRONT WILL DROP INTO THE 
NORTHWEST PART OF THE STATE TONIGHT...SO LOWS WILL RANGE WIDELY BY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. COLD ADVECTION WILL BE FELT STRONGER IN THE 
NORTHWEST SO TEMPERATURES THERE WILL RISE LITTLE FROM THEIR MORNING 
LOWS. CENTRAL AND SOUTH ARKANSAS WILL BENEFIT FROM SOME TEMPERATURE 
RISE IN THE DRY SLOT. GRADIENT WILL BE STRONG AROUND THE SURFACE LOW 
FROM MIDDAY WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY EVENING...RESULTING IN 
NOTICEABLE WIND CHILLS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL BE A RATHER COLD NIGHT 
FOR ALL SECTIONS OF THE STATE. FREEZING TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE 
NORTHWEST MAY REQUIRE A FREEZE WARNING FOR THAT PART OF THE STATE 
SINCE WE HAVE BEEN EXPERIENCING ABOVE NORMAL LOWS. HIGHS THURSDAY 
WILL BEGIN TO BENEFIT FROM RETURN FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
SURFACE RIDGE TO OUR SOUTH...AND LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT WILL STAY ABOVE 
FREEZING FOR THE SAME REASON. HIGHS FRIDAY WILL CONTINUE A SLIGHT 
WARMING TREND.

A COUPLE OF COLD FRONTS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA IN THE EXTENDED. 
EACH WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY SOME MOISTURE AND WILL HAVE SOME CHANCE 
POPS WITH EACH. TIMING RIGHT NOW LOOKS LIKE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY FOR THE FIRST FRONT AND SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY FOR THE 
SECOND FRONT. A WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES OVER THE 
AREA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. COLD AND DRY AIR SHOULD ACCOMPANY 
THAT AND LOWERED TEMP AND DEW POINT FORECASTS TO ACCOUNT FOR THAT 
AND MAY NOT BE COLD ENOUGH. OTHERWISE TEMPS IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD 
WILL RUN NEAR OR A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 255 PM CST MON NOV 22 2004

AFTER A RATHER MILD NOVEMBER THUS FAR...BIG CHANGES ARE COMING IN 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL ROLL INTO ARKANSAS BY 
MIDWEEK...WITH FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN NORTHERN/WESTERN ARKANSAS
BY THANKSGIVING MORNING. 

IN THE SHORT TERM...STATIONARY FRONT NEAR ARKANSAS/LOUISIANA BORDER

AREAS OF FOG WILL ALSO FORM...WITH TEMPERATURES SHOWING VERY LITTLE 
FLUCTUATION. 

TOWARD TUESDAY AFTERNOON...RATHER VIGOROUS SYSTEM ALOFT WILL MOVE 
FROM TEXAS PANHANDLE INTO CENTRAL TEXAS...AND WILL BECOME NEGATIVELY 
TILTED. SURFACE LOW WILL BEGIN INTENSIFYING IN NORTHEAST TEXAS...AND 
WILL HEAD ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS TUESDAY EVENING. 

MODELS DIVERGING ON HOW FAR NORTH LOW WILL DEVELOP...WHICH WILL HAVE 
A BEARING ON WHERE SEVERE WEATHER WILL OCCUR TUESDAY

SOUTHERN COUNTIES...WITH SEVERE STORMS MAINLY CONFINED TO AREAS 
ALONG THE GULF COAST. FROM EASTERN TEXAS TO LOUISIANA/MISSISSIPPI...
SQUALL LINE WILL BE LIKELY WITH TORNADOES POSSIBLE. IN ARKANSAS... 
LOOKS MORE LIKE A RAIN/ISOLATED THUNDER EVENT. RAIN MAY BE HEAVY IN

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY
WEATHER THE NEXT THREE DAYS WILL BE AFFECTED BY THE BEHAVIOR OF THE
STRONG UPPER LOW OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA THIS MORNING. IT IS EXPECTED
TO COME EAST AND MOVE OVER NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS LATE TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. SINCE THE SYSTEM IS NOT COMING OUT YET...THERE
ARE STILL UNCERTAINTIES ON TIMING AND LOCATION OF THE UPPER LOW AS
IT MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTH CENTRAL U.S.  UNTIL THIS LOW BEGINS TO
APPROACH...THE AREA WILL BE IN AN OVERRUNNING PATTERN WITH A NEARLY
STATIONARY FRONT TO THE SOUTH. THIS WILL LIKELY LAST INTO TUESDAY.
DO NOT SEE MUCH CHANGE IN THE WEATHER UNTIL THEN. LOW CLOUDS
WILL CONTINUE. MOST AREAS HAVE RATHER DENSE FOG THIS MORNING AND
WILL ISSUE A DENSE FOG ADVISORY THROUGH MUCH OF THE MORNING FOR
THE WHOLE AREA ALTHOUGH NOT EVERYONE WILL MEET VISIBILITY 
CRITERIA. WITH THIS OVERRUNNING PATTERN CONTINUING...SOME FOG MAY
PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY INTO TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. AS FOR POPS...
WILL HAVE THE HIGHEST POPS CLOSEST TO THE FRONT WHERE MOISTURE
IS MORE PLENTIFUL DECREASING TO CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH. LOOK FOR 
MOSTLY LIGHT AMOUNTS OF RAIN TODAY. ALSO...THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE
OR NO INSTABILITY...SO WILL NOT MENTION THUNDER. TEMPS SHOULD NOT 
RISE MUCH AND WENT WITH MAXES CLOSE TO THOSE OF YESTERDAY. FOR
TONIGHT...SHORT WAVES MOVE INTO THE AREA AND MOISTURE INCREASES. 
THIS WILL RESTULT IN POSSIBLY HEAVIER RAINS...BUT AT THIS TIME
IT STILL LOOKS LIKE THE REAL HEAVY RAIN WILL STAY TO THE SOUTH. 
WENT WITH LIKELY POPS IN THE NORTH INCREASING TO CATEGORICAL IN
THE SOUTH. PUT IN ISOLATED THUNDER FOR ABOUT THE SOUTHERN HALF
FOR SOME ELEVATED CONVECTION. WENT CLOSE TO PERSISTENCE FOR 
MINS. ON TUESDAY...THE MAIN UPPER LOW WILL APPROACH THE AREA. 
THE LOW WILL BE COMING IN FARTHER TO THE SOUTH AND INDICATIONS
ARE THAT THIS CWA WILL STAY IN THE COOL SECTOR FOR MOST OF THE
DAY. WILL SEE INCREASE IN RAIN AND HEAVY RAIN THREAT WILL INCREASE. 
DO NOT SEE MUCH CHANCE OF SEVERE WEATHER DURING THE DAY TUESDAY.
GENERALLY WENT BETWEEN MAV AND FWC FOR MAXES. WOULD LOOK FOR A 
RAPID MOVING SQUALL LINE TO DEVELOP WITH THE PACIFIC FRONT ON 
TUESDAY SOMEWHERE IN TEXAS. THIS SHOULD PUSH ACROSS LOUISIANA 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WILL LIKELY EXTEND SOMEWHERE INTO ARKANSAS. 
LOOKS LIKE NORTHERN EXTENT OF THE SQUALL LINE WILL BE IN CENTRAL
OR SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AND THE BEST CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER WITH
IT WILL BE IN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS WITH A STRONG SURFACE
LOW DEVELOPING IN ARKANSAS. THE WARM FRONT MAY NOT GET FAR NORTH 
EXCEPT IN EASTERN SECTIONS WHICH IS OFTEN THE CASE. THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE AREA MAY STAY IN THE COOL SECTOR WHICH WILL LIMIT 
INSTABILITY AND SEVERE WEATHER. MAIN CHANCE OF SEVERE MAY BE
HAIL PRODUCING THUNDERSTORMS WITH MAYBE AN ISOLATED BOW ECHO 
OR TWO. WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
MENTIONED. SINCE CONFIDENCE IN SEVERE THREAT IS NOT SO HIGH FOR
THIS AREA...WILL NOT MENTION SEVERE IN THE ZONES BUT WILL HIT IT
IN THE HWO AND WEATHER SUMMARIES. APPEARS THE SQUALL LINE SHOULD
RACE WELL EAST OF THE AREA BY LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND ENDED ALL
THUNDER BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. GOING INTO WEDNESDAY...WRAP AROUND
MOISTURE WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND WEAKENS. STILL LOOKS LIKE THE LOW WILL
MOVE ENOUGH TO THE NORTH AND COLD ENOUGH AIR WILL STAY AWAY ENOUGH
TO NOT HAVE TO WORRY ABOUT A CHANGE TO WINTER PRECIP IN THE 
NORTH...BUT IT COULD GET CLOSE IN THE EXTREME NORTH. WILL KEEP SOME 
POPS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AREAS FOR WEDNESDAY. WENT WITH NEARLY
STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS. COLDER AIR SHOULD MOVE IN WEDNESDAY
NIGHT AND THANKSGIVING AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES AWAY. MUCH OF THE 
NORTH MAY HAVE A FREEZE THURSDAY MORNING.     
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
ONE SHORT WAVE WILL BE LEAVING OUR VICINITY THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE 
FLOW BECOMES ZONAL UNTIL THE NEXT WAVE TAKES SHAPE FOR THE WEEK END. 
BY 12Z SUNDAY...THE NEXT TROF WILL INTENSIFY AND IT WILL PUSH 
NORTHEAST FROM THE OK PAN HANDLE TO KMKC TO SOUTH CENTRAL WISCONSIN. 
IT WILL PRODUCE A SURFACE LOW THAT WILL TRACK FROM CENTRAL KANSAS TO 
THE GREAT LAKES AREA. THIS WILL BRING A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
SUNDAY JUST AHEAD OF THE DRY SURGE...AND A CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN ITS 
WAKE WITH WRAP AROUND MOISTURE FOR LATE SUNDAY. WINDS WILL BE A

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 250 PM CST SUN NOV 21 2004

LOW CLOUDS AND CHILLY NELY SFC FLOW PREVAILS ACRS THE FA THIS AFTN. 
SOME PATCHY LIGHT RAIN ALSO NOTED. TEMPS HAVE ONLY MANAGED A FEW 
DEGREES OF RECOVERY FROM MRNG LOWS...WITH MID-AFTN READINGS IN THE 
50S TO LOWER 60S.

MODELS CONT TO INDC THAT SWLY FLOW ALOFT WL PREVAIL ACRS THE 
MID-SOUTH THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH PARENT UPPER LOW SITUATED OVR THE 
SWRN STATES. SEVERAL SHRTWVS ARE FCST TO MOVE NEWD ACRS AR IN THE 
SHORT TERM. EACH UPPER FEATURE WILL INTERACT WITH SFC FNT S OF AR TO 
PRODUCE A CONTD OVERRUNNING PATTERN.

THE NEXT UPPER WAVE IS FCST TO PASS S OF THE AREA LATER TNGT AND 
MON. HAVE CONTD TRENDS OF GOING FCST WITH HIGHEST POPS MENTIONED OVR 
SRN AR AND LOWER CHCS TO THE N. ANOTHER ROUND OF RAINFALL WILL 
AFFECT THE AREA MON NIGHT INTO TUE ASSOCD WITH THE NEXT UPPER WAVE.

MAIN UPPER LOW HEADS INTO THE SRN PLAINS ON TUE AND CONTS NEWD TUE 
NIGHT AND WED. DIFFERENCES NOTED BETWEEN THE ETA AND GFS WITH 
EVENTUALLY TRACK OF UPPER LOW. ETA IS FURTHER N WITH UPPER/SFC LOW 
TRACK AS COMPARED TO THE GFS SOLUTION. AT THIS POINT...HAVE USED A 
BLEND OF BOTH SOLUTIONS AND EXPECT MODELS TO COME INTO BETTER 
AGREEMENT THE NEXT RUNS. EVENTUAL TRACK OF THIS SYS WILL DETERMINE 
THE POTENTIAL FOR SVR WX.

UPPER SYS AND ASSOCD SFC CDFNT MOVES E OF THE LATE TUE NIGHT AND 
WED...ALLOWING COLDER AIR TO MOVE IN. HAVE LEFT SOME CHC POPS IN FOR 
WRAPAROUND PRECIP LATE TUE NIGHT INTO WED. APPEARS THAT THE CHC OF 
ANY WINTRY PRECIP WL STAY JUST TO THE NW OF THE FA ATTM...BUT WILL 
BEAR WATCHING.

NORTHWEST FLOW DOMINATES THROUGH FRIDAY. HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO 
THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BRINGING IN SUBSIDENCE AND DRIER AIR. 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THROUGH MUCH OF FRIDAY...AS THE UPPER 
TROUGH MOVES TO THE EAST COAST. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE 
AREA FRIDAY AFTERNOON BUT WILL WASH OUT AS HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS. A 
SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE ROCKIES ON SATURDAY AND MOVES INTO 
NORTH TEXAS ON SUNDAY AND NORTH OF ARKANSAS SUNDAY NIGHT. SOUTHWEST 
FLOW RETURNS ON SATURDAY AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING LOW. WILL INCLUDE

LOW CLOUDS AND CHILLY NELY SFC FLOW PREVAILS ACRS THE FA THIS AFTN. 
SOME PATCHY LIGHT RAIN ALSO NOTED. TEMPS HAVE ONLY MANAGED A FEW 
DEGREES OF RECOVERY FROM MRNG LOWS...WITH MID-AFTN READINGS IN THE 
50S TO LOWER 60S.

MODELS CONT TO INDC THAT SWLY FLOW ALOFT WL PREVAIL ACRS THE 
MID-SOUTH THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH PARENT UPPER LOW SITUATED OVR THE 
SWRN STATES. SEVERAL SHRTWVS ARE FCST TO MOVE NEWD ACRS AR IN THE 
SHORT TERM. EACH UPPER FEATURE WILL INTERACT WITH SFC FNT S OF AR TO 
PRODUCE A CONTD OVERRUNNING PATTERN.

THE NEXT UPPER WAVE IS FCST TO PASS S OF THE AREA LATER TNGT AND 
MON. HAVE CONTD TRENDS OF GOING FCST WITH HIGHEST POPS MENTIONED OVR 
SRN AR AND LOWER CHCS TO THE N. ANOTHER ROUND OF RAINFALL WILL 
AFFECT THE AREA MON NIGHT INTO TUE ASSOCD WITH THE NEXT UPPER WAVE.

MAIN UPPER LOW HEADS INTO THE SRN PLAINS ON TUE AND CONTS NEWD TUE 
NIGHT AND WED. DIFFERENCES NOTED BETWEEN THE ETA AND GFS WITH 
EVENTUALLY TRACK OF UPPER LOW. ETA IS FURTHER N WITH UPPER/SFC LOW 
TRACK AS COMPARED TO THE GFS SOLUTION. AT THIS POINT...HAVE USED A 
BLEND OF BOTH SOLUTIONS AND EXPECT MODELS TO COME INTO BETTER 
AGREEMENT THE NEXT RUNS. EVENTUAL TRACK OF THIS SYS WILL DETERMINE 
THE POTENTIAL FOR SVR WX.

UPPER SYS AND ASSOCD SFC CDFNT MOVES E OF THE LATE TUE NIGHT AND

NORTHWEST FLOW DOMINATES THROUGH FRIDAY. HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO 
THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BRINGING IN SUBSIDENCE AND DRIER AIR. 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THROUGH MUCH OF FRIDAY...AS THE UPPER 
TROUGH MOVES TO THE EAST COAST. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE

.DISCUSSION...
AREA OF RAIN THAT HAD COVERED MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE CWA
HAS ALREADY SHIFTED OFF TO THE EAST FASTER THAN ANTICIPATED INDICATING
THAT THE SHORT WAVE IS LIKELY MOVING THROUGH FASTER. AREAS OF LIGHT
RAIN AND DRIZZLE CONTINUE ELSEWHERE. ALSO...TEMPS DID NOT FALL OFF
AS MUCH OVERNIGHT AS ANTICIPATED AND ARE CLOSE TO THE FORECAST 
MAXES. UPDATED TO LOWER POPS IN THE SOUTH TO LIKELY (60 PERCENT)
AND RAISED MOST MAX TEMP FORECASTS ABOUT A CATEGORY. THE LOW CLOUDS
AND NORTHEAST WINDS AND POSSIBLY SOME COLD ADVECTION SHOULD KEEP
TEMPS FROM RISING MUCH...BUT THEY STILL MAY GO UP AS MUCH AS 
5 DEGREES.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 400 AM CST SUN NOV 21 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
THE NEXT THREE DAYS WILL BE DOMINATED BY A BIG UPPER TROF IN THE
SOUTHWEST AND THE RESULTING SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT OVER THE AREA WITH
SEVERAL SHORT WAVES MOVING THROUGH. IT LOOKS LIKE THE TROF ITSELF
WILL MOVE OUT ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS
THE AREA THIS MORNING WILL LIKELY REACH INTO SOUTHERN SECTIONS OR 
JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE CWA AND BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY. THIS
WILL RESULT IN AN OVERRUNNING PATTERN FOR ARKANSAS THROUGH MONDAY
NIGHT AND POSSIBLY MUCH OF TUESDAY. CHANCES OF RAIN WILL BE ENHANCED
EACH TIME A SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH. ONE AREA IN THE SOUTH THIS 
MORNING IS ALREADY SHIFTING EAST AT ISSUE TIME. DESPITE THIS...
WILL CONTINUE WITH CATEGORICAL POPS IN THE SOUTH FOR TODAY WITH
POPS DECREASING TO LIKELY ACROSS CENTRAL SECTIONS AND CHANCE IN
THE NORTH. DID TAPER OFF POPS DURING THE AFTERNOON. THE UNSTABLE
AIR IS MAINLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA SO THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD
BE MOSTLY STRATIFORM BUT COULD SEE ISOLATED THUNDER IN THE SOUTH. 
THAT SHOULD HOLD THROUGH MONDAY. WENT WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS IN THE 
NORTH TO LIKELY IN THE SOUTH FOR TONIGHT THEN LIKELY POPS ACROSS
THE AREA FOR MONDAY. AS THE MAIN TROF APPROACHES MONDAY NIGHT...WENT
WITH CATEGORICAL POPS. THE HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL WILL INCREASE MONDAY
NIGHT AS DIFFLUENCE INCREASES AHEAD OF THE UPPER TROF. THE BEST CHANCE
OF HEAVY RAIN WILL BE NEAR AND JUST NORTH OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. 
STILL MANY UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE ACTUAL TRACK OF THE UPPER LOW AS
IT COMES OUT ON TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL AFFECT WHERE
THE SURFACE LOW TRACKS AND HOW THE ATTENDANT WARM AND COLD...AND
POSSIBLY EVEN OCCLUDED...FRONTS MOVE. THIS WILL HAVE A BEARING ON 
THE CHANCE OF ANY SEVERE WEATHER FOR ARKANSAS. THE WARM FRONT MAY NOT
GET THROUGH MUCH OF ARKANSAS AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE THE BEST 
INSTABILITY AND CHANCE OF SEVERE WEATHER WOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF THE
AREA. PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE WARM FRONT AND WARM SECTOR
WILL AT LEAST GET INTO SOUTHEASTERN ARKANSAS AND THE NORTHWEST 
HAS THE LEAST CHANCE OF GETTING INTO THE WARM AIR. KEPT TEMPS
IN THE 50S IN THE NORTHWEST FOR TUESDAY WHILE WARMED UP THE 
SOUTHEAST INTO THE LOWER 70S. BROADBRUSHED A 70 PERCENT CHANCE
OF THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA FOR TUESDAY AND MENTIONED HEAVY
RAIN. WILL HOLD OFF ON SEVERE WORDING UNTIL THAT THREAT BECOMES 
BETTER FOCUSED. LOOKING RIGHT NOW LIKE A SQUALL LINE WILL BE THE
MAIN WEATHER MOVING THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING. 
CONTINUED CHANCES OF RAIN INTO TUESDAY NIGHT WITH POPS DECREASING.
KEPT THUNDER IN THE FORECAST EARLY BUT DROPPED MENTION OF THUNDER
AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE AREA SHOULD BE INTO THE COOLER AIR BY THEN. 
MOST OF THE WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WILL STAY TO THE NORTH OF THE 
AREA BUT DID KEEP HIGHER POPS IN THE NORTH. PRESENT INDICATIONS
ARE THE AIR COLD ENOUGH TO PRESENT A CHANCE OF WINTER PRECIPITATION
WILL STAY TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA. CONTINUED SOME POPS INTO WEDNESDAY
FOR WRAPAROUND CONCERNS BUT HAVE ALL POPS OUT BY AFTERNOON. 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TUESDAY MAXES AS MENTIONED EARLIER...GENERALLY
WENT CLOSE TO THE MAV/MEX FOR TEMP FORECASTS THROUGH WEDNESDAY.     
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING 
WHEN A WEAK SHORT WAVE TURNS THE FLOW ZONAL THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING 
AND SOUTHWESTERLY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHER 
JUST TO OUR NORTH ON FRIDAY AND OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS FOR SATURDAY. 
AT THE SURFACE...DRY AIR WILL MOVE RAPIDLY ACROSS THE STATE FROM 
NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST ON THURSDAY. THEN...MOISTURE WILL COVER THE 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF ARKANSAS FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EASTERN ARKANSAS

THE NORTH. DID TAPER OFF POPS DURING THE AFTERNOON. THE UNSTABLE
AIR IS MAINLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA SO THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD
BE MOSTLY STRATIFORM BUT COULD SEE ISOLATED THUNDER IN THE SOUTH. 
THAT SHOULD HOLD THROUGH MONDAY. WENT WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS IN THE 
NORTH TO LIKELY IN THE SOUTH FOR TONIGHT THEN LIKELY POPS ACROSS
THE AREA FOR MONDAY. AS THE MAIN TROF APPROACHES MONDAY NIGHT...WENT
WITH CATEGORICAL POPS. THE HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL WILL INCREASE MONDAY
NIGHT AS DIFFLUENCE INCREASES AHEAD OF THE UPPER TROF. THE BEST CHANCE
OF HEAVY RAIN WILL BE NEAR AND JUST NORTH OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. 
STILL MANY UNCERTAINTIES ABOUT THE ACTUAL TRACK OF THE UPPER LOW AS
IT COMES OUT ON TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL AFFECT WHERE
THE SURFACE LOW TRACKS AND HOW THE ATTENDANT WARM AND COLD...AND
POSSIBLY EVEN OCCLUDED...FRONTS MOVE. THIS WILL HAVE A BEARING ON 
THE CHANCE OF ANY SEVERE WEATHER FOR ARKANSAS. THE WARM FRONT MAY NOT
GET THROUGH MUCH OF ARKANSAS AND IF THAT WERE THE CASE THE BEST 
INSTABILITY AND CHANCE OF SEVERE WEATHER WOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF THE
AREA. PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE WARM FRONT AND WARM SECTOR
WILL AT LEAST GET INTO SOUTHEASTERN ARKANSAS AND THE NORTHWEST 
HAS THE LEAST CHANCE OF GETTING INTO THE WARM AIR. KEPT TEMPS
IN THE 50S IN THE NORTHWEST FOR TUESDAY WHILE WARMED UP THE 
SOUTHEAST INTO THE LOWER 70S. BROADBRUSHED A 70 PERCENT CHANCE
OF THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA FOR TUESDAY AND MENTIONED HEAVY
RAIN. WILL HOLD OFF ON SEVERE WORDING UNTIL THAT THREAT BECOMES 
BETTER FOCUSED. LOOKING RIGHT NOW LIKE A SQUALL LINE WILL BE THE
MAIN WEATHER MOVING THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING. 
CONTINUED CHANCES OF RAIN INTO TUESDAY NIGHT WITH POPS DECREASING.
KEPT THUNDER IN THE FORECAST EARLY BUT DROPPED MENTION OF THUNDER
AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE AREA SHOULD BE INTO THE COOLER AIR BY THEN. 
MOST OF THE WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WILL STAY TO THE NORTH OF THE 
AREA BUT DID KEEP HIGHER POPS IN THE NORTH. PRESENT INDICATIONS
ARE THE AIR COLD ENOUGH TO PRESENT A CHANCE OF WINTER PRECIPITATION
WILL STAY TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA. CONTINUED SOME POPS INTO WEDNESDAY
FOR WRAPAROUND CONCERNS BUT HAVE ALL POPS OUT BY AFTERNOON. 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TUESDAY MAXES AS MENTIONED EARLIER...GENERALLY
WENT CLOSE TO THE MAV/MEX FOR TEMP FORECASTS THROUGH WEDNESDAY.     
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING 
WHEN A WEAK SHORT WAVE TURNS THE FLOW ZONAL THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING 
AND SOUTHWESTERLY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHER 
JUST TO OUR NORTH ON FRIDAY AND OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS FOR SATURDAY. 
AT THE SURFACE...DRY AIR WILL MOVE RAPIDLY ACROSS THE STATE FROM 
NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST ON THURSDAY. THEN...MOISTURE WILL COVER THE 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF ARKANSAS FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EASTERN ARKANSAS 
SATURDAY MORNING. SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL INCREASE IN STRENGTH DURING 
THE DAYLIGHT HOURS SUNDAY.

MOISTURE IS IN THE SOUTH SO WILL HAVE HIGHER POPS IN THAT AREA. 
WENT CLOSE TO PERSISTENCE ON MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY. FRONT WILL LIKELY
MOVE INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS OR NORTHERN LOUISIANA TONIGHT AND STALL
FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. THIS WILL SET UP AN OVERRUNNING SITUATION
FOR THE AREA AS WEAK SHORT WAVES COME OUT OF SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. 
THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL REMAIN IN THE SOUTH SO WILL KEEP
HIGHER POPS IN THAT AREA. LITTLE OR NO INSTABILITY IS PROGGED IN

BE LITTLE DIURNAL VARIATION IN TEMPS. UPPER LOW IN THE SOUTHWEST 
BEGINS TO MOVE OUT ON MONDAY AND WILL APPROACH THE AREA TUESDAY.
MORE SIGNIFICANT RAINS FROM THIS MAY REACH THE AREA LATE MONDAY

THIS COULD BE A FOCUS FOR HEAVY RAIN. SOME UNSTABLE AIR WILL
MOVE IN FROM THE SOUTH SO WILL BEGIN MENTION OF THUNDER ON 
MONDAY NIGHT. TROF STARTS TO MOVE ACROSS THE PLAINS TUESDAY. 
GFS HINTING AT A SQUALL LINE MOVING RAPIDLY THROUGH THE AREA
TUESDAY AFTERNOON. THIS SITUATION IS LIKELY TO CHANGE SOME MORE

COULD BE A SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER THREAT. FOR NOW WILL

VSBYS HAVE IMPROVED OVR THE FA AT LATE MRNG. WENT AHEAD AND REMOVED 
FOG AND DRIZZLE FROM THE FCST. LOW CLOUDS WL PERSIST ACRS THE AREA 
THIS AFTN...WITH A FEW BREAKS EXPECTED. TWEAKED MAX TEMPS A FEW 
DEGREES LOWER BASED ON LATEST TRENDS. UPDATED ZNS AND GRIDS ALREADY 
OUT.
&&

.PREV DISUSSION...
ISSUED AT 400 AM CST FRI NOV 19 2004

SHORT WAVE HAS MOVED PAST THE AREA BUT MOISTURE REMAINS. AREAS OF FOG
AND DRIZZLE COVER MUCH OF THE CWA ESPECIALLY THE EASTERN HALF. THIS
SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE MORNING. GETTING TO BE THE TIME OF YEAR 
THAT FOG MAY HANG IN ALL DAY. MODELS SHOW SOME DRYING NEAR THE GROUND
THIS AFTERNOON BUT KEEP MOISTURE AT LOW LEVELS SUGGESTING STRATUS 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY BUT THE FOG WILL LIFT. WILL GO WITH 
AREAS OF FOG AND DRIZZLE THROUGH MID MORNING THEN KEEP A CHANCE OF
DRIZZLE THE REST OF THE DAY. SEE LITTLE CHANCE FOR MEASURABLE RAIN
WITH NO SIGNIFCANT SHORT WAVES OR FRONTS AROUND. TEMPS MAY NOT MOVE 
UP TOO MUCH AND AM RELUCTANT TO GO AS WARM AS GUIDANCE ON MAXES. A 
WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES INTO THE AREA TONIGHT BUT OVERALL MOISTURE IS 
STILL NOT HIGH BUT WILL KEEP SMALL POPS GOING WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
POPS IN THE SOUTH. FOG WILL PROBABLY BE AN ISSUE AGAIN BUT WILL LET 
DAY SHIFT EVALUATE THAT. MINS SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO THIS MORNING. 
ON SATURDAY...A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO NORTHWESTERN SECTIONS BY
LATE IN THE DAY WHILE A SHEARED SHORT WAVE WILL BE ACROSS THE SOUTH. 
WENT WITH CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE AREA WITH THE HIGHEST POPS IN 
THE SOUTH. WENT CLOSE TO PERSISTENCE ON MAXES. SHORT WAVE MOVES 
PAST THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT WHILE THE WEAK FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE 
AREA. KEPT LIKELY POPS OVER ABOUT THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA WITH
30 PERCENT POPS IN THE NORTH. AFTER THAT...AN OVERRUNNING PATTERN
SETS UP WITH A STRONG UPPER TROF IN THE SOUTHWEST. KEPT SMALL
POPS GOING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT THEN INCREASED POPS TO THE SOUTH
MONDAY AS THE UPPER TROF BEGINS TO COME OUT.   

UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL CONTINUE MOVING RIGHT ALONG WITH TROFS 
DROPPING INTO THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE COUNTRY...PRODUCING A CUT 
OFF LOW BRIEFLY...AND EJECTING IT TO THE NORTHEAST IN FAIRLY FAST 
FLOW AS THE WESTERLIES AND THE LOW COME IN PHASE. THE SURFACE 
PATTERN WILL REFLECT THOSE CHANGES WITH A LOW MOVING NORTHEAST 
ACROSS THE STATE...BRINGING COOLER AND SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR FOR 
THURSDAY. THE NEXT FRONT WILL NOT BE TOO FAR BEYOND THE END OF THIS

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
KLZK RADAR SHOWS RAIN ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA THIS MORNING 
CONTINUING TO MOVE NORTH. A FEW BREAKS IN THE RAIN ARE NOTED BUT 
THESE WILL SOON FILL BACK IN THIS MORNING. SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW 
CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA AND THE UPPER LOW IS INDICATED 
OVER OKLAHOMA. TEMPERATURES ARE AGAIN ON THE MILD SIDE THIS MORNING 
...MOSTLY IN THE 50S WITH A FEW LOWER 60S IN THE SOUTH.

MODELS ARE EVEN MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH THIS SYSTEM ON THE LATEST RUN. 
GFS SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON IT AND WILL STAY CLOSE. THE UPPER 
LOW WILL MOVE ACROSS NORTHWEST ARKANSAS TODAY AND INTO SOUTHWEST 
ILLINOIS BY TONIGHT. BEST CHANCES OF RAIN ACROSS THE AREA APPEAR TO 
BE THIS MORNING AND INTO EARLY AFTERNOON BEFORE DECREASING. WILL 
ALSO INCLUDE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE DAY TODAY...AS CROSS 
SECTIONS CONTINUE TO SHOW GOOD LIFT. A WARM FRONT IN NORTH LOUISIANA 
WILL NOT MOVE MUCH TODAY AND A DEVELOPING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO 
WEST ARKANSAS BY FRIDAY MORNING. WITH THE SURFACE LOW MOVING 
NORTH...THE COLD FRONT WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA. THIS 
WILL KEEP CHANCES OF RAIN IN THE FORECAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
ANOTHER SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS IN SOUTHERN ARKNASAS BY SUNDAY... 
CONTINUING THE CHANCES OF RAIN. THIS WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE BEST 
CHANCES OF RAIN IN SOUTH ARKANSAS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 

A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
WILL BRING COOLER TEMPERATURES TO THE AREA AT THAT TIME. 
OTHERWISE...TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE FAIRLY MILD.
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MODELS THIS MORNING HAVE DIVERGED VERY LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS RUNS 
BUT SOME CHANGES TO THE POPS ARE STILL ANTICIPATED.PATTERN CONTINUES 
TO BECOME VERY PROGRESSIVE AND GFS CONTINUES TO BE THE MODEL OF 
CHOICE. ONCE AGAIN GFS WILL BE FOLLOWED FAIRLY CLOSELY. MODEL STILL 
LOOKS A TAD TOO QUICK WITH EJECTING THE CUT OFF LOW OUT OF THE 
SOUTHWEST CONUS LATE IN THE PERIOD SO WILL FOLLOW A SLOWER TREND 
HERE.

MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW PERIOD STARTING OFF WITH STRONG MID LEVEL 
RIDGING OFF THE WEST COAST WITH POSITIVELY TILTED TROUGH EXTENDING 
FROM ST JAMES BAY TO BAJA. NORTHERN PORTION OF THE TROF WILL 
ACCELERATE EASTWARD WHILE STRONG UPPER LOW CUTS OFF OVER NORTHWEST 
MEXICO. UPPER LOW WILL THEN BEGIN ITS EASTWARD PROGRESSION PASSING 
OVER THE CENTER OF THE STATE WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH UPPER TROF 
ARRIVING QUICKLY BEHIND IT. BELIEVE OUR CURRENT POPS ARE TOO LOW 
WEDNESDAY AND WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY.

UNTIL THEN...PATTERN WILL ALSO BE A BIT UNSETTLED. FRONT THAT MOVES 
THROUGH SUNDAY TAKES UP RESIDENCE ALONG THE GULF COAST. SURFACE WAVE 
DEVELOPS ON THE FRONT MONDAY TO JUSTIFY AT LEAST SCATTERED POPS OVER 
THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE CWA. MODELS NOW GENERATING WEAK SURFACE 
LOW JUST SOUTH OF THE ARKLATEX LATE TUESDAY IN ADVANCE OF THE 
APPROACHING UPPER WAVE WITH ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. POPS WILL 
NEED TO BE RAISED HERE AS WELL WITH HIGHER POPS TO THE SOUTH.

WITH NO OVERLY COLD AIR IN SITE...TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO OR 
EVEN A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE NORMAL. LATEST MEX NUMBERS SUPPORT THIS 
LINE OF THINKING AND ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
335 AM CST WED NOV 17 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING CONTINUES TO SHOW AMPLE CLOUDS ACROSS 
THE AREA. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE UPPER LOW IN SOUTHWEST TEXAS 
PUSHING EAST. TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING WERE WARMEST IN THE WESTERN 
SECTIONS DUE TO GOOD WAA. 

UPPER RIDGE OVER MUCH OF EASTERN U.S. WILL BEGIN TO 
WEAKEN AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES EAST TONIGHT. THE SURFACE LOW LOCATED 
IN CENTRAL TEXAS THIS MORNING WILL MOVE NORTH INTO OKLAHOMA 
TONIGHT...DRAGGING THE ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT CLOSER TO ARKANSAS. 
THIS WILL SET THE STAGE FOR SOME OVERRUNNING PRECIPITATION TONIGHT. 
WILL SPREAD CHANCES EASTWARD OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT AND A BIT FASTER WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRECIPITATION... 
BUT NONE THE LESS AS THE LOW APPROACHES...PRECIPITATION WILL BECOME 
LIKELY BY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. CROSS SECTIONS SHOW THE 
BEST LIFT DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS OF THURSDAY SO WILL 
INCLUDE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THURSDAY. MODELS ARE 
INDICATING 1 TO 2 INCHES POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY. CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL 
MOVE NORTH OF THE STATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND WILL DECREASE POPS. 
SEVERAL LINGERING SHORT WAVES ROTATE THROUGH ON FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...SO WILL NEED TO KEEP POPS IN THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 

TEMPERATURES WILL BE A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER TODAY WITH SOME 
SUNSHINE AND WARM SOUTHEAST WINDS BEING RESPONSIBLE. WILL NOT EXPECT 
A BIG WARM UP ON THURSDAY DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION. 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN FOR FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN DECENT AGREEMENT REGARDING THE OVERALL 
PATTERN WITH DIFFERENCES IN THE FINER DETAILS. HOWEVER...DIFFERENCES 
ARE LESS THAN THAN THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. GFS 
HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT SOLUTION SO FAR AND HAS NOT CHANGED 
CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST FEW RUNS. OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SEEM 
TO BE MOVING TOWARDS THE OVERALL GFS SOLUTION AND FOR THAT PRIMARY 
REASON...I WILL ALSO GO THAT WAY AND LEAN HEAVILY TOWARDS THE GFS 
SOLUTION.

MODELS CONTINUE TO BUILD A VERY STRONG RIDGE THAT PARALLELS THE 
WESTERN CONUS COAST. MEANWHILE TROFFING EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL CANADA 
ALL THE WAY TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH ADDITIONAL RIDGING ALONG 
THE EASTERN SEABOARD. NORTHERN PART OF THE TROF STRETCHES OUT TO THE 
CANADIAN MARITIMES WHILE THE SOUTHERN PART SINKS INTO NORTHERN 
MEXICO EFFECTIVELY DAMPENING OUT THE EAST COAST RIDGE. FRONTAL 
SYSTEM FROM SATURDAY WILL STALL OUT ALONG THE GULF COAST WHILE 
ANOTHER WEAKER FRONT WILL DROP DOWN FROM THE NORTH ON SUNDAY. 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WITH THIS FRONT APPEARS TO BE LIMITED BY LACK 
OF SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE LOW. 
 
THE FRONT MOVES TO THE EAST AS A STRONG GREAT BASIN HIGH DEVELOPS 
AND STARTS TO SLIDE TO THE EAST. POSITION OF THE HIGH WILL KEEP AREA 
IN A PREDOMINATE NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW WHICH WILL RESULT IN 
ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER AND COOL TEMPERATURES. KEPT TUESDAY DRY AS HIGH 
BEGINS TO TAKE OVER. MEX TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE LOOKS REASONABLE AND 
WILL BE FOLLOWED FAIRLY CLOSELY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
335 AM CST WED NOV 17 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS MORNING CONTINUES TO SHOW AMPLE CLOUDS ACROSS 
THE AREA. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS THE UPPER LOW IN SOUTHWEST TEXAS 
PUSHING EAST. TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING WERE WARMEST IN THE WESTERN 
SECTIONS DUE TO GOOD WAA. 

UPPER RIDGE OVER MUCH OF EASTERN U.S. WILL BEGIN TO 
WEAKEN AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES EAST TONIGHT. THE SURFACE LOW LOCATED 
IN CENTRAL TEXAS THIS MORNING WILL MOVE NORTH INTO OKLAHOMA 
TONIGHT...DRAGGING THE ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT CLOSER TO ARKANSAS. 
THIS WILL SET THE STAGE FOR SOME OVERRUNNING PRECIPITATION TONIGHT. 
WILL SPREAD CHANCES EASTWARD OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT AND A BIT FASTER WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE PRECIPITATION... 
BUT NONE THE LESS AS THE LOW APPROACHES...PRECIPITATION WILL BECOME 
LIKELY BY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. CROSS SECTIONS SHOW THE 
BEST LIFT DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS OF THURSDAY SO WILL 
INCLUDE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THURSDAY. MODELS ARE 
INDICATING 1 TO 2 INCHES POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY. CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL 
MOVE NORTH OF THE STATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND WILL DECREASE POPS. 
SEVERAL LINGERING SHORT WAVES ROTATE THROUGH ON FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...SO WILL NEED TO KEEP POPS IN THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 

TEMPERATURES WILL BE A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER TODAY WITH SOME 
SUNSHINE AND WARM SOUTHEAST WINDS BEING RESPONSIBLE. WILL NOT EXPECT 
A BIG WARM UP ON THURSDAY DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION. 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN FOR FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN DECENT AGREEMENT REGARDING THE OVERALL 
PATTERN WITH DIFFERENCES IN THE FINER DETAILS. HOWEVER...DIFFERENCES 
ARE LESS THAN THAN THEY HAVE BEEN OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. GFS 
HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT SOLUTION SO FAR AND HAS NOT CHANGED 
CONSIDERABLY OVER THE PAST FEW RUNS. OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SEEM 
TO BE MOVING TOWARDS THE OVERALL GFS SOLUTION AND FOR THAT PRIMARY 
REASON...I WILL ALSO GO THAT WAY AND LEAN HEAVILY TOWARDS THE GFS 
SOLUTION.

MODELS CONTINUE TO BUILD A VERY STRONG RIDGE THAT PARALLELS THE 
WESTERN CONUS COAST. MEANWHILE TROFFING EXTENDS FROM CENTRAL CANADA 
ALL THE WAY TO SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA WITH ADDITIONAL RIDGING ALONG 
THE EASTERN SEABOARD. NORTHERN PART OF THE TROF STRETCHES OUT TO THE 
CANADIAN MARITIMES WHILE THE SOUTHERN PART SINKS INTO NORTHERN 
MEXICO EFFECTIVELY DAMPENING OUT THE EAST COAST RIDGE. FRONTAL 
SYSTEM FROM SATURDAY WILL STALL OUT ALONG THE GULF COAST WHILE 
ANOTHER WEAKER FRONT WILL DROP DOWN FROM THE NORTH ON SUNDAY. 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WITH THIS FRONT APPEARS TO BE LIMITED BY LACK 
OF SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE LOW. 
 
THE FRONT MOVES TO THE EAST AS A STRONG GREAT BASIN HIGH DEVELOPS 
AND STARTS TO SLIDE TO THE EAST. POSITION OF THE HIGH WILL KEEP AREA 
IN A PREDOMINATE NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW WHICH WILL RESULT IN 
ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER AND COOL TEMPERATURES. KEPT TUESDAY DRY AS HIGH 
BEGINS TO TAKE OVER. MEX TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE LOOKS REASONABLE AND 
WILL BE FOLLOWED FAIRLY CLOSELY.

OVERALL PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
BROAD TROF IN THE NATIONS MID SECTION ANCHORED BY RIDGING ON BOTH 
COASTS. STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE LEFT BEHIND IN THE WAKE OF 
THE REMNANTS OF THE UPPER LOW. NEXT FRONT QUICKLY DROPS DOWN FROM 
THE NORTHWEST AND WILL BE IN EXTREME NORTHWEST ARKANSAS BY THE START 
OF THE PERIOD. FRONT QUICKLY CRUISES THROUGH THE STATE SATURDAY FOR 
CHANCE POPS AT THIS POINT. AIR MASS BEHIND THE FRONT IS OF PACIFIC 
ORIGIN AND NO REAL COLD AIR IS IN SIGHT ALTHOUGH TEMPERATURES WILL 
DROP OFF IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT. 

RIDGING BUILDS OFF THE WEST COAST AND UPPER TROF TAKES ON A POSITIVE 
TILT SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS ANOTHER CUT OFF LOW BEGINS TO GET CARVED 
OUT IN THE SOUTHWEST CONUS. SURFACE HIGH LOCATED OVER THE WESTERN 
PLAINS WILL PROVIDE NORTH TO NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS TO KEEP THE 
CLOUDS AND COOL AIR ON PLACE IN SPITE OF SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPING 
LATE IN THE PERIOD.

ISSUED AT 304 AM CST MON NOV 15 2004

ALL SHORT RANGE MODELS ARE CONTINUING THEIR TREND OF MOVING THE CUT 
OFF LOW CURRENTLY OVER THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA SLOWLY TO THE EAST. 
THERE IS BETTER AGREEMENT THIS MORNING WITH THIS DEVELOPING SCENARIO 
VERSUS THE PAST FEW MODEL RUNS WITH A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN 
FORECASTER CONFIDENCE. WILL CONTINUE THE TREND OF LATE AND GO WITH A 
BLEND OF FORECAST MODELS WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY MORE 
CONSISTENT GFS SOLUTION.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY PRETTY MUCH MUCH TELLS THE STORY WITH ALL MAJOR 
PLAYERS CLEARLY SEEN. AFOREMENTIONED CUT OFF CONTINUES TO SPIN OVER 
THE SOUTHWEST WITH EVENTUAL KICKER UPSTREAM OVER THE CENTRAL 
PACIFIC. RIDGE OVER THE NATIONS MIDSECTION...CENTERED IN THE CENTRAL 
GULF...WITH SHORT WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE TOP OF IT ALSO EVIDENT. 

UPPER LOW FORECAST TO SIT AND SPIN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS TAKING 
ON A NEGATIVE TILT BUT MAKING VERY LITTLE EASTWARD PROGRESSION 
AGAINST THE MID LEVEL RIDGE. CENTRAL PACIFIC SYSTEM FINALLY KICKS 
THE SYSTEM OUT ON DAY THREE. SYSTEM WEAKENS AS IT MOVES EAST AND NOT 
MUCH MORE THAN ANN OPEN WAVE OVER EASTERN TEXAS BY THE END OF THE 
PERIOD. RIDGE EVENTUALLY KNOCKED DOWN AND SHUNTED EAST BY THIS WAVE 
AND ADDITIONAL SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA.

MEANWHILE...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY DRIFTS SLOWLY 
SOUTH THROUGH THE PERIOD MAINTAINING A MOIST EAST TO SOUTHEAST 
SURFACE COMPONENT. PATTERN WILL RESULT IN A CONTINUATION OF LOW 
CLOUDS OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

PLENTY OF DEEP MOISTURE DRAWN UP ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE 
HIGH. THE POSITION OF THE HIGH AND THE OVERALL SLUGGISH SPEED OF 
THE PATTERN WOULD PRECLUDE THE DEEP MOISTURE FROM GETTING INTO THE 
REGION UNTIL THE EXTENDED PERIOD. UPPER LOW DOES EJECT A FEW WEAK 
SHORTWAVES EARLY IN THE PERIOD THAT MOVE ACROSS THE NORTH. BUT WITH 
THE RIDGE HOLDING FIRM...ONLY SCATTERED POPS ARE JUSTIFIED AT THIS 
POINT. WITH NO SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVES SEEN FOR WEDNESDAY OR 
THURSDAY AND RIDGE HOLDING TIGHT...WILL TRIM POPS BACK ALL AREAS 
EXCEPT THE WEST. WILL MAINTAIN HIGHER POPS HERE TO ACCOUNT FOR WHATS 
LEFT OF THE UPPER LOW APPROACHING THE AREA. 

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROBLEMATIC. EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER 
WILL NOT ALLOW FOR MUCH OF A DIURNAL RANGE THROUGH THE PERIOD. A 
SLOW WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR THROUGH THE WEEK AS SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT SLOWLY DEVELOPS. BLEND OF THE MAV/FWC NUMBERS WILL BE USED 
WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY COOLER FWC.

PATTERN REMAINS COMPLICATED THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH MODELS OFFERING 
DIFFERING SOLUTIONS. WILL CONTINUE TO GO WITH A BLEND OF GFS/ECMWF 
SOLUTIONS BASED ON THEIR CONTINUITY OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS.

REMNANTS OF UPPER LOW FINALLY PUSH THROUGH FRIDAY AS LOW PRESSURE 
MOVES ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA. ASSOCIATED WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT FOR BEST RAIN FALL CHANCES THIS WEEK. IN THE 
WAKE OF THE FRONT...BROAD TROF OVER THE NATIONS MID SECTION IS 
CARVED OUT AS STRONG RIDGE BUILDS ALONG THE WEST COAST. 

MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES OVER THE AREA WITH A FEW SHORTWAVES 
PASSING THROUGH TO JUSTIFY AT LEAST CHANCE POPS THROUGHOUT THE 
PERIOD. STRONGER FRONT BEGINS TO PRESS DOWN FROM THE NORTH LATE 
SUNDAY AND TROUGH SHARPENS UP CONSIDERABLY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
MILD ON FRIDAY PROCEEDING THE FRONT BUT COOLING OFF FOR THE WEEKEND 
WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND NORTHWEST WINDS.

304 AM CST MON NOV 15 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
ALL SHORT RANGE MODELS ARE CONTINUING THEIR TREND OF MOVING THE CUT 
OFF LOW CURRENTLY OVER THE GULF OF CALIFORNIA SLOWLY TO THE EAST. 
THERE IS BETTER AGREEMENT THIS MORNING WITH THIS DEVELOPING SCENARIO 
VERSUS THE PAST FEW MODEL RUNS WITH A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN 
FORECASTER CONFIDENCE. WILL CONTINUE THE TREND OF LATE AND GO WITH A 
BLEND OF FORECAST MODELS WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY MORE 
CONSISTENT GFS SOLUTION.

WATER VAPOR IMAGERY PRETTY MUCH MUCH TELLS THE STORY WITH ALL MAJOR 
PLAYERS CLEARLY SEEN. AFOREMENTIONED CUT OFF CONTINUES TO SPIN OVER 
THE SOUTHWEST WITH EVENTUAL KICKER UPSTREAM OVER THE CENTRAL 
PACIFIC. RIDGE OVER THE NATIONS MIDSECTION...CENTERED IN THE CENTRAL 
GULF...WITH SHORT WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE TOP OF IT ALSO EVIDENT. 

UPPER LOW FORECAST TO SIT AND SPIN OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS TAKING 
ON A NEGATIVE TILT BUT MAKING VERY LITTLE EASTWARD PROGRESSION 
AGAINST THE MID LEVEL RIDGE. CENTRAL PACIFIC SYSTEM FINALLY KICKS 
THE SYSTEM OUT ON DAY THREE. SYSTEM WEAKENS AS IT MOVES EAST AND NOT 
MUCH MORE THAN ANN OPEN WAVE OVER EASTERN TEXAS BY THE END OF THE 
PERIOD. RIDGE EVENTUALLY KNOCKED DOWN AND SHUNTED EAST BY THIS WAVE 
AND ADDITIONAL SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA.

MEANWHILE...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY DRIFTS SLOWLY 
SOUTH THROUGH THE PERIOD MAINTAINING A MOIST EAST TO SOUTHEAST 
SURFACE COMPONENT. PATTERN WILL RESULT IN A CONTINUATION OF LOW 
CLOUDS OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

PLENTY OF DEEP MOISTURE DRAWN UP ON THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE 
HIGH. THE POSITION OF THE HIGH AND THE OVERALL SLUGGISH SPEED OF 
THE PATTERN WOULD PRECLUDE THE DEEP MOISTURE FROM GETTING INTO THE 
REGION UNTIL THE EXTENDED PERIOD. UPPER LOW DOES EJECT A FEW WEAK 
SHORTWAVES EARLY IN THE PERIOD THAT MOVE ACROSS THE NORTH. BUT WITH 
THE RIDGE HOLDING FIRM...ONLY SCATTERED POPS ARE JUSTIFIED AT THIS 
POINT. WITH NO SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVES SEEN FOR WEDNESDAY OR 
THURSDAY AND RIDGE HOLDING TIGHT...WILL TRIM POPS BACK ALL AREAS 
EXCEPT THE WEST. WILL MAINTAIN HIGHER POPS HERE TO ACCOUNT FOR WHATS 
LEFT OF THE UPPER LOW APPROACHING THE AREA. 

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE PROBLEMATIC. EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER 
WILL NOT ALLOW FOR MUCH OF A DIURNAL RANGE THROUGH THE PERIOD. A 
SLOW WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR THROUGH THE WEEK AS SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT SLOWLY DEVELOPS. BLEND OF THE MAV/FWC NUMBERS WILL BE USED

930 PM CST SAT NOV 13 2004

LOW CLOUDS HAVE MOVED IN FROM THE EAST UNDERNEATH THE HIGH CLOUDS 
THAT ARE ADVANCING FROM THE WEST. TEMPERATURES HAVE GONE UP A DEGREE 
OR TWO AT SOME LOCATIONS...WHILE THEY HAVE DROPPED ONLY ONE DEGREE 
AT OTHER SPOTS. CHANGED THE CLOUD COVER IN THE GRIDS AND UPPED THE 
LOWS TONIGHT. UPDATE OUT ALREADY (32).

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 250 PM CST SAT NOV 13 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
LOW CLOUDS OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST TODAY...WITH MID AND HIGH 
CLOUDS OVER THE REST OF THE STATE. NORTHEAST WINDS KEPT COOL AND DRY 
AIR OVER THE STATE.

LARGE TROUGH OVER THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER IN 
THE WEATHER THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. MOISTURE IS BEGINNING TO RETURN 
IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW...WITH LOWER CLOUDS PRESENT OVER OKLAHOMA 
AND TEXAS. THIS RETURN OF MOISTURE WILL HELP KEEP TEMPERATURES 
WARMER TONIGHT THAN THIS MORNING.

1035 AM CST SAT NOV 13 2004

.DISCUSSION...
QUICK UPDATE MAINLY TO TWEAK SKY AND TEMPS. COOL START TO THE 
MORNING WITH PARTS OF NORTHERN ARKANSAS FALLING BELOW FREEZING. 
CLOUD COVER OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF...BUT MOST LOCATIONS WILL BE 
PARTLY CLOUDY. OVERALL...GOING FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AND UPDATES 
ALREADY GONE.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 355 AM CST SAT NOV 13 2004

STRONG HIGH PRESSURE WILL SAG SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND 
OHIO VALLEY THE NEXT FEW DAYS. AT THE SAME TIME...A STORM SYSTEM 
WILL HEAD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
AHEAD OF THE STORM SYSTEM...LOTS OF CLOUDS WILL BE NOTED ACROSS THE 
SOUTHWEST TODAY...AND FROM WESTERN INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS ON 
SUNDAY/MONDAY. THE HIGH IN THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PREVENT THE CLOUDS 
FROM BUILDING INTO THE EASTERN COUNTIES.

CIRCULATION AROUND THE HIGH WILL CONTINUE BRINGING AN EAST TO 
NORTHEAST WIND...WITH COOL WEATHER RESULTING. IN GENERAL...BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED DURING THE SHORT TERM. 

DEWPOINTS WILL STAY RATHER LOW THIS WEEKEND WITH DRY AIRMASS NEAR 
THE SURFACE. THIS WILL HELP PREVENT TEMPERATURES FROM CLIMBING MUCH 
DURING THE DAY UNDER THE CLOUDS...WITH SOME OF THE COOLEST READINGS 
IN THE WESTERN HALF OF THE STATE. DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WILL TEND TO 
BE A BIT WARMER IN THE EAST WITH A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE. 

DRY AIRMASS WILL ALSO HELP POSTPONE ANY SIGNIFICANT RAIN THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS...WITH HIGH PRESSURE SLOWING THE PROGRESSION OF THE STORM 
TO THE WEST. ONLY SMALL CHANCES FOR RAIN MENTIONED TOWARD THE END OF 
THE SHORT TERM...WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN THE WESTERN COUNTIES. (46)

CONTINUES TO APPEAR THAT ACTIVE PATTERN WILL BE SHAPING UP FOR THE 
EXTENDED. SOUTHWESTERLY 500 MB FLOW OVER THE AREA WILL ALLOW FOR 
PACIFIC MOISTURE TO STREAM UP OVER MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN UNITED 
STATES. IN THE INITIAL EXTENDED PERIODS...THIS MOISTURE WILL BE 
IMPEDED SOMEWHAT BY UPPER RIDGE...WHICH LOOKS TO FLATTEN OUT TOWARD 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 

SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN MOISTURE WILL OCCUR ALONG AND NORTH OF 
APPROACHING WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY WHICH WILL BE MOVING UP FROM THE 
GULF COAST ON WEDNESDAY. ISENTROPIC UPLIFT SITUATION WILL BE SETTING 
UP...WITH RAIN DEVELOPING NORTH OF THE SURFACE BOUNDARY AND TO THE 
NORTHEAST OF DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW. UPPER LEVEL IMPULSES MOVING UP 
IN THE MEAN FLOW AND ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WILL ALLOW FOR SOME 
EMBEDDED THUNDER WITHIN THE RAIN. 

UPPER LOW WILL BE FAIRLY DEEP AS IT EJECTS OUT OF NORTHERN MEXICO BY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SPEED OF THE SYSTEM IS IN QUESTION...AS MODEL 
SOLUTIONS ARE DIFFERING TO VARYING DEGREES THIS MORNING. IF THE 
UPPER RIDGE FLATTENS OUT BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...GOING FORECAST TRENDS 
SHOULD PAN OUT...WITH SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS SOME 
TIME THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...IF UPPER RIDGE STAYS IN 
PLACE...THE LOW AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE SYSTEM COULD BE DELAYED BY AS 
MUCH AS 6 TO 12 HOURS OR MORE. 

TO TOP THAT ALL OFF...DGEX IS ACTUALLY PUSHING THE SYSTEM THROUGH 
THE AREA BY LATE THURSDAY...WITH THE GFS ABOUT 12 HOURS SLOWER...AND 
THE ECMWF/UKMET/CANADIAN SOLUTIONS EVEN SLOWER THAN THAT. CURRENT 
FORECAST TAKES A MIDDLE OF THE ROAD APPROACH WHICH IS NOT AS SLOW AS 
THE OTHER MODELS. NEEDLESS TO SAY...CONFIDENCE IN TIMING THESE 
FEATURES IS NOT VERY HIGH.

MORNING. (57)

IN THE NORTH. HOWEVER...LOW CLOUDS HANGING ON IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS AROUND HARRISON. EVEN THROUGH SKIES ARE CLEARING 
NOW...ONCE THE SUN SETS AND COOLER AIR MOVES IN...THINK THAT CLOUDS 
WILL REDEVELOP SOMEWHAT. ALSO...CIRRUS MOVING EAST FROM THE PLAINS 
WILL HELP CURB TEMPS. ALL THAT BEING SAID...THINK THAT TEMPS WILL 
GET TO JUST ABOVE FREEZING TONIGHT IN THE EXTREME NORTH. SOME OF THE 
NORMALLY COLDER LOCATIONS COULD SEE READINGS RIGHT AROUND THE 
FREEZING MARK.

CLOUDS WILL HANG ON IN THE SOUTH OVERNIGHT...BEFORE GRADUALLY 
DECREASING DURING THE DAY SATURDAY. NORTHEAST FLOW WILL KEEP COOL 
TEMPERATURES IN THE FORECAST FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

THE CUT OFF LOW IN THE SOUTHWEST WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER IN THE

PLENTY OF LOW STRATUS AROUND THE AREA...WITH ONLY A FEW BREAKS IN 
THE NORTH. CLOUDS WILL HANG TOUGH TODAY DUE TO COLD AIR 
ADVECTION...SO IF ANY BREAKS DO OCCUR...THEY WILL BE SHORT LIVED. 
SOME DRIZZLE REPORTED THIS MORNING...BUT ENDED IN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
HOURS. ADJUSTED HIGHS DOWN BY A COUPLE OF DEGREES AS CLOUD COVER 
WILL INHIBIT HEATING.

CLEARING WILL START ACROSS THE EXTREME NORTH THIS EVENING...BUT WILL

COLD FRONT PUSHING TO SOUTH OF ARKANSAS THIS MORNING...WITH COOLER 
AIR FILTERING INTO THE STATE FROM THE NORTH/NORTHEAST. LOTS OF LOW 
CLOUDS IN PLACE...AND THAT WILL BE THE THEME FOR TODAY WITH SOME 
MORNING DRIZZLE/FOG. SURE FEELING A WHOLE LOT MORE LIKE FALL...AND 
TEMPERATURES NOT APT TO REBOUND MUCH IN THE SHORT TERM. 

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BEHIND FRONT WILL PRODUCE A PERSISTENT 
NORTHEAST WIND INTO FIRST PART OF THE WEEKEND. AS HIGH NUDGES INTO 
THE REGION...STORM SYSTEM ALOFT WILL HEAD THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES TODAY/TONIGHT. RIDGING AHEAD OF SYSTEM MAY ALLOW FOR SOME 
BRIEF CLEARING...MAINLY IN NORTHERN ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON AND THE 
NORTHEAST HALF OF THE STATE TONIGHT. HOWEVER...AS SYSTEM 
APPROACHES...CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AGAIN SATURDAY/SUNDAY. 

SYSTEM WILL SPREAD CHANCES FOR RAIN INTO THE STATE LATE 
MONDAY/TUESDAY...WITH A WET PATTERN HEADING INTO THE LONG 
TERM.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE TRICKY...AND WILL HINGE ON CLOUD COVER. 
CONFIDENCE IS NOT REAL HIGH IN THE AMOUNT OF CLEARING THAT WILL TAKE 
PLACE TODAY/SATURDAY...WITH LOTS OF CLOUDS A SAFE BET SUNDAY/MONDAY. 
WILL MENTION THAT FAIR AMOUNT OF CLOUDS AND A NORTHEAST WIND THIS 
TIME OF YEAR USUALLY MEANS COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES...AND 
THAT IS WHAT IS NOTED IN THE FORECAST. FREEZING TEMPERATURES NOT 
REAL LIKELY IN THE SHORT TERM...BUT IT WILL BE A CLOSE CALL TONIGHT 
IN THE NORTH...ESPECIALLY IF CLEARING OCCURS.                   

FAIRLY ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IS SHAPING UP FOR THE LONG TERM. BY 
MONDAY NIGHT...RETURN FLOW WILL START TO SET UP OVER WESTERN/
NORTHERN ARKANSAS AS SURFACE RIDGE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY STARTS TO 
MOVE NORTHEAST. UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME MORE SOUTHWESTERLY...AND AS A 
RESULT...MOISTURE WILL INCREASE OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA. 

WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BEGIN MOVING BACK TO THE NORTH FROM 
TEXAS. FAIRLY POTENT 500 MB LOW WILL BEGIN EJECTING OUT OF MEXICO AS 
WELL. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST ON 
WEDNESDAY AS THE UPPER SYSTEM AND DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW ALONG THE 
FRONT APPROACH THE AREA. PRECIPITATION WILL START OUT FAIRLY 
STRATIFORM...WITH ELEVATED STORMS DEVELOPING ALONG AND TO THE NORTH 
OF THE SURFACE BOUNDARY. 

SYSTEMS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA SOME TIME DURING THE THURSDAY/
FRIDAY TIME FRAME. MODELS DIFFERING TO VARYING DEGREES IN TIMING 
THESE FEATURES...SO RIGHT NOW WILL NOT GO ANY HIGHER THAN CHANCE 
POPS FOR THESE PERIODS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL...AS 
SURFACE FLOW STAYS OUT OF THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST...AND UPPER FLOW 
PATTERN REMAINS SOUTHWESTERLY TO ZONAL.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
RAIN HAD PRETTY WELL ENDED OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY MID AFTERNOON. 
WITH H5 LOW LIFTING SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD...WILL KEEP A SMALL CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS THIS EVENING OVER THE EXTREME NORTHEASTERN AND EXTREME 
SECTIONS. CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA DURING 
THE NIGHT. THIS WILL HELP HOLD TEMPERATURES UP. THUS...WILL NOT SEE 
ANY WIDESPREAD FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN THE NORTH OVERNIGHT. THE 
EXCEPTION MAY BE ISOLATED AREAS OVER THE EXTREME NORTH THAT ARE 
ALWAYS COLDER THAN THE SURROUNDING AREAS. MOISTURE WILL BE SLOW TO 
EXIT THE AREA ON FRIDAY. THIS COUPLED WITH NORTHEASTERLY WINDS AND 
CYCLONIC FLOW WILL HELP HOLD QUITE A FEW CLOUDS IN OVER THE AREA ON 
FRIDAY. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO BREAK FRIDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER AND 
MAINLY PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOL. 
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHWEST WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER IN THE 
EXTENDED FORECAST. MODELS ARE COMING BACK SLOWER WITH THE 
SYSTEM...SO HAVE ACCORDINGLY SLOWED THE POP TRENDS. MONDAY WILL BE 
DRY AS HIGH PRESSURE OVERHEAD AHEAD OF AFOREMENTIONED SYSTEM. THE 
HIGH WILL HEAD EAST TUESDAY...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS INCLUDED FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ARE LOOKING WET...WITH CHANCE 
POPS. IN TIME...THESE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE INCREASED...BUT DUE 
TO UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING...HAVE HELD OFF ON A DRAMATIC CHANGE FROM 
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. AFTER A COOL START MONDAY...TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE NEAR NORMAL TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.

RAIN HAD PRETTY WELL ENDED OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY MID AFTERNOON. 
WITH H5 LOW LIFTING SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD...WILL KEEP A SMALL CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS THIS EVENING OVER THE EXTREME NORTHEASTERN AND EXTREME 
EASTERN SECTIONS. CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS WILL CONTINUE OVER THE 
AREA DURING THE NIGHT. THIS WILL HELP HOLD TEMPERATURES UP. 
THUS...WILL NOT SEE ANY WIDESPREAD FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN THE 
NORTH OVERNIGHT. THE EXCEPTION MAY BE ISOLATED AREAS OVER THE 
EXTREME NORTH THAT ARE ALWAYS COLDER THAN THE SURROUNDING AREAS. 
MOISTURE WILL BE SLOW TO EXIT THE AREA ON FRIDAY. THIS COUPLED WITH 
NORTHEASTERLY WINDS AND CYCLONIC FLOW WILL HELP HOLD QUITE A FEW 
CLOUDS IN OVER THE AREA ON FRIDAY. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO BREAK FRIDAY 
NIGHT. DRY WEATHER AND MAINLY PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOL.

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE SOUTHWEST WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER IN THE

DRY AS HIGH PRESSURE OVERHEAD AHEAD OF AFOREMENTIONED SYSTEM. THE 
HIGH WILL HEAD EAST TUESDAY...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS INCLUDED FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ARE LOOKING WET...WITH CHANCE 
POPS. IN TIME...THESE WILL PROBABLY HAVE TO BE INCREASED...BUT DUE

.DISCUSSION...
UPDATED FORECASTS TO REMOVE POPS FROM THE EXTREME WEST AND SOUTHWEST 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON. ELSEWHERE KEPT 20-30 PCT POPS FOR REMAINDER OF 
AFTERNOON...WITH BIGGER POPS IN THE NORTHEAST...CLOSER TO THE UPPER 
LOW. UPDATES GONE. 
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
ISSUED AT 214 AM CST THU NOV 11 2004

PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF OVERALL PATTERN SUPPORTED BY ALL OPERATIONAL 
MODELS THIS MORNING WITH SPLIT FLOW OVER THE CONUS. ACTIVE SOUTHERN 
STREAM CONTAINS TWO DISTINCT UPPER LOWS SEEN CLEARLY ON WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY THIS MORNING. POSITION OF THE UPPER LOW OVER EAST CENTRAL 
OKLAHOMA VERY CLOSE TO PLACEMENT OF BOTH THE GFS AND ETA SOLUTIONS. 
GFS HAS VARIED VERY LITTLE FROM ITS THINKING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL 
DAYS WHILE ETA HAS CONTINUED TO BE A BIT INCONSISTENT. AS SUCH... 
WILL LEAN HEAVILY TOWARDS A GFS SOLUTION THIS MORNING.

AFOREMENTIONED UPPER LOW OVER EAST CENTRAL OKLAHOMA MOVES SLOWLY 
EASTWARD ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS THROUGH THE DAY. SYSTEM CONTINUES 
TO SLOWLY WEAKEN OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BEFORE DISSIPATING AS IT 
GETS ABSORBED INTO A TROF OVER THE GREAT LAKES. SYSTEM VERTICALLY 
STACKED WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE UPPER 
LOW. COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM THE SURFACE LOW ACROSS EASTERN OKLAHOMA 
AND TEXAS. SECOND COLD FRONT EXTENDS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE 
FIRST ONE ACROSS THE PLAINS WITH SOME RATHER CHILLY AIR BEHIND IT. 
PLENTY OF SHOWERS OVER THE EASTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE CWA IN AN AREA 
OF WARM AIR ADVECTION AND ENHANCED LIFT. ANOTHER AREA OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE WEST ALONG A WIND SHIFT LINE WITH GOOD 
SURFACE CONVERGENCE AND SOME DIFFLUANCE ALOFT. 

THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BECOME MORE ELEVATED WITH TIME AND INSTABILITY 
REMAINS WEAK. SEVERE CONCERNS ARE MINIMAL ALTHOUGH SOME GUSTY WINDS 
CAN NOT BE RULED OUT. 

MODELS CAME BACK SLOWER WITH THIS MORNING WITH SURFACE LOW AND 
ASSOCIATED FRONTS NOT REACHING THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER UNTIL LATE IN 
THE DAY. COLDER AIR SWEEPS IN BEHIND THE FRONT WITH STEADY OR SLOWLY 
FALLING TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE NORTH IN DEVELOPING COLD AIR 
ADVECTION PATTERN. PRECIP WRAPPING AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW 
OVER NORTHERN OKLAHOMA AND SOUTHERN KANSAS. WITH SLOWER MOVEMENT OF 
THE SYSTEM AND RESIDUAL RAIN...WILL KEEP POPS GOING ALL DAY BUT WILL
BEGIN TO TAPER THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST EARLY THIS MORNING. WOULD 
NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME HAIL ACROSS THE NORTH TODAY AS POCKET 
OF COLD AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW MOVES ACROSS. AIR MASS COULD 
DESTABILIZE ENOUGH WITH ANY DAYTIME HEATING ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THIS 
WOULD BE MINIMAL. 

ONCE LOW PULLS OUT...SECONDARY COLD FRONT SWEEPS THROUGH AND 
CANADIAN HIGH BEGINS TO BUILD IN. COOLEST AIR OF THE SEASON TO DATE  
COMES IN ON GUSTY NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS. WHILE GRADIENT BETWEEN 
THE DEPARTING LOW AND BUILDING HIGH TIGHTENS...IT APPEARS WINDS WILL 
STAY BELOW WIND LAKE ADVISORY CRITERIA BUT IT WILL BE CLOSE. ENOUGH 
CLOUD COVER WILL BE LEFT TONIGHT TO KEEP TEMPS FROM TOTALLY 
BOTTOMING OUR BUT WIDESPREAD 30S STILL APPEAR LIKELY ACROSS THE 
NORTH. HIGH BUILDS DOWN FRIDAY FOR CLEARING SKIES WITH TEMPERATURES 
HARD PRESSED TO GET OUT OF THE UPPER 40S NORTH AND 50S ELSEWHERE.

COLDEST NIGHT WILL BE FRIDAY NIGHT WITH WIDESPREAD 30S EXPECTED. 
UPPER 20S ACROSS THE NORTH ALSO SEEM LIKELY. HIGH WILL DOMINATE ON 
SATURDAY WITH TEMPERATURES REMAINING COOL. HIGH BEGINS TO MOVE 
EASTWARD ON SUNDAY BUT EASTERLY SURFACE FLOW WOULD PRECLUDE ANY 
SUBSTANTIAL WARMING THROUGH THE WEEKEND. AS NEXT SYSTEM IN THE 
SOUTHWEST CONUS BEGINS TO LIFT OUT SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...SOME 
MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO ENCROACH ON THE STATE AND WILL KEEP LOW POPS 
IN SUNDAY NIGHT. CLOUDS WILL KEEP TEMPS FROM TOTALLY BOTTOMING OUT 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY MORNINGS. WENT WITH A BLEND OF MAV AND FWC 
NUMBERS. 

BY EARLY MONDAY...THE PREFERRED NEW 11.00 GFS90 MODEL RUN WITH A 
DEEPENING CLOSED-OFF H5 LOW NEAR NORTHERN BAJA WILL LIKELY VERIFY 
BEST. THIS PUTS ARKANSAS UNDER A SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WITH A SERIES 
OF VORTS EXPECTED TO APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND BRING ABOUT 
PERIODS OF RAIN MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
DEVELOP BY LATE TUESDAY AS A STRONGER VORT MOVES ACROSS. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...
PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF OVERALL PATTERN SUPPORTED BY ALL OPERATIONAL 
MODELS THIS MORNING WITH SPLIT FLOW OVER THE CONUS. ACTIVE SOUTHERN 
STREAM CONTAINS TWO DISTINCT UPPER LOWS SEEN CLEARLY ON WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY THIS MORNING. POSITION OF THE UPPER LOW OVER EAST CENTRAL 
OKLAHOMA VERY CLOSE TO PLACEMENT OF BOTH THE GFS AND ETA SOLUTIONS. 
GFS HAS VARIED VERY LITTLE FROM ITS THINKING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL 
DAYS WHILE ETA HAS CONTINUED TO BE A BIT INCONSISTENT. AS SUCH... 
WILL LEAN HEAVILY TOWARDS A GFS SOLUTION THIS MORNING.

AFOREMENTIONED UPPER LOW OVER EAST CENTRAL OKLAHOMA MOVES SLOWLY 
EASTWARD ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS THROUGH THE DAY. SYSTEM CONTINUES 
TO SLOWLY WEAKEN OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BEFORE DISSIPATING AS IT 
GETS ABSORBED INTO A TROF OVER THE GREAT LAKES. SYSTEM VERTICALLY 
STACKED WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE UPPER 
LOW. COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM THE SURFACE LOW ACROSS EASTERN OKLAHOMA 
AND TEXAS. SECOND COLD FRONT EXTENDS ALMOST IMMEDIATELY BEHIND THE 
FIRST ONE ACROSS THE PLAINS WITH SOME RATHER CHILLY AIR BEHIND IT. 
PLENTY OF SHOWERS OVER THE EASTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE CWA IN AN AREA 
OF WARM AIR ADVECTION AND ENHANCED LIFT. ANOTHER AREA OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE WEST ALONG A WIND SHIFT LINE WITH GOOD 
SURFACE CONVERGENCE AND SOME DIFFLUANCE ALOFT. 

THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BECOME MORE ELEVATED WITH TIME AND INSTABILITY 
REMAINS WEAK. SEVERE CONCERNS ARE MINIMAL ALTHOUGH SOME GUSTY WINDS 
CAN NOT BE RULED OUT. 

MODELS CAME BACK SLOWER WITH THIS MORNING WITH SURFACE LOW AND 
ASSOCIATED FRONTS NOT REACHING THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER UNTIL LATE IN 
THE DAY. COLDER AIR SWEEPS IN BEHIND THE FRONT WITH STEADY OR SLOWLY 
FALLING TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE NORTH IN DEVELOPING COLD AIR 
ADVECTION PATTERN. PRECIP WRAPPING AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW 
OVER NORTHERN OKLAHOMA AND SOUTHERN KANSAS. WITH SLOWER MOVEMENT OF 
THE SYSTEM AND RESIDUAL RAIN...WILL KEEP POPS GOING ALL DAY BUT WILL
BEGIN TO TAPER THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST EARLY THIS MORNING. WOULD 
NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME HAIL ACROSS THE NORTH TODAY AS POCKET 
OF COLD AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW MOVES ACROSS. AIR MASS COULD 
DESTABILIZE ENOUGH WITH ANY DAYTIME HEATING ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THIS 
WOULD BE MINIMAL. 

ONCE LOW PULLS OUT...SECONDARY COLD FRONT SWEEPS THROUGH AND 
CANADIAN HIGH BEGINS TO BUILD IN. COOLEST AIR OF THE SEASON TO DATE  
COMES IN ON GUSTY NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS. WHILE GRADIENT BETWEEN 
THE DEPARTING LOW AND BUILDING HIGH TIGHTENS...IT APPEARS WINDS WILL 
STAY BELOW WIND LAKE ADVISORY CRITERIA BUT IT WILL BE CLOSE. ENOUGH 
CLOUD COVER WILL BE LEFT TONIGHT TO KEEP TEMPS FROM TOTALLY 
BOTTOMING OUR BUT WIDESPREAD 30S STILL APPEAR LIKELY ACROSS THE 
NORTH. HIGH BUILDS DOWN FRIDAY FOR CLEARING SKIES WITH TEMPERATURES 
HARD PRESSED TO GET OUT OF THE UPPER 40S NORTH AND 50S ELSEWHERE.

COLDEST NIGHT WILL BE FRIDAY NIGHT WITH WIDESPREAD 30S EXPECTED. 
UPPER 20S ACROSS THE NORTH ALSO SEEM LIKELY. HIGH WILL DOMINATE ON 
SATURDAY WITH TEMPERATURES REMAINING COOL. HIGH BEGINS TO MOVE 
EASTWARD ON SUNDAY BUT EASTERLY SURFACE FLOW WOULD PRECLUDE ANY 
SUBSTANTIAL WARMING THROUGH THE WEEKEND. AS NEXT SYSTEM IN THE 
SOUTHWEST CONUS BEGINS TO LIFT OUT SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...SOME 
MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO ENCROACH ON THE STATE AND WILL KEEP LOW POPS

UPPER LOW APPEARS TO BE OVER NORTH CENTRAL OKLAHOMA AT ISSUE
TIME BASED ON SATELLITE. MAIN COLD FRONT IS LAGGING BEHIND THE
SYSTEM. MAIN LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS IS INTO EXTREME EASTERN 
OKLAHOMA AND IT SHOULD PROGRESS EAST INTO ARKANSAS AND ACROSS
THE AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT. MEANWHILE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED MOSTLY FROM WARM ADVECTION AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS WESTERN AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS. THIS 
HAS ALSO BEEN AIDED BY SOME UPPER DIFFLUENCE AHEAD OF THE UPPER 
LOW. INSTABILITY IS QUITE MARGINAL SO THIS WILL CUT DOWN ON
SEVERE POTENTIAL ALTHOUGH ISOLATED STRONG STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE.
FIGURE ON ACTIVITY CONTINUING TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE OVER THE
NEXT FEW HOURS SO LEFT POPS AT 80 PERCENT. DID UPDATE MAINLY
TO CLEAR UP EVENING WORDING. UPPED WIND FORECASTS A LITTLE IN THE
EAST WHERE STRONGER SOUTHEAST WINDS HAVE DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THE
PRECIPITATION...BUT THAT SHOULD DECREASE SOME ONCE RAIN BEGINS.

WITH SOUTHEAST WINDS CONTINUING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE 
AREA...THE TEMPERATURES ARE IN NEED OF BEING INCREASED. BUMPED 
TEMPERATURES UP 5 TO 7 DEGREES. SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW BROKEN CLOUDS 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE WESTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE. INCREASED CLOUD 
COVER BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS. LATEST KLZK SOUNDING SHOWS A GOOD 
PORTION OF DRY AIR IN PLACE YET. WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO MOISTEN UP 
THE LOWER LEVELS...THEREFORE BETTER CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WILL BE 
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WITH CHANCES INCREASING THROUGH THE NIGHT. 
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF OVERALL PATTERN SUPPORTED BY ALL OPERATIONAL 
MODELS THIS MORNING. ETA SOLUTION CONTINUES TO BE INCONSISTENT 
VERSUS THE GFS MODEL OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS WITH REGARDS TO BOTH 
TIMING AND STRENGTH OF THE MAJOR PLAYERS. GFS MODEL ALSO SUPPORTED 
BY OTHER SHORT TERM MODELS AND HAS VARIED VERY LITTLE FROM ITS 
THINKING OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. AS SUCH...WILL LEAN HEAVILY 
TOWARDS A GFS SOLUTION THIS MORNING.

DRY PATTERN OF LATE WILL BE UNDERGOING A RATHER DRAMATIC CHANGE OVER 
THE NEXT 36 HOURS AS UPPER LEVEL LOW CURRENTLY OVER THE NEW MEXICO 
AND COLORADO BORDER KICKS OUT INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. FEATURE IS 
QUITE EVIDENT ON WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND LINES UP VERY WELL WITH THE 
GFS POSITION. WATER VAPOR ALSO SHOWING INCREASING PLUME OF GULF 
MOISTURE. PWAT VALUES OF BARELY 1/2 INCH OFF THE 00Z LZK SOUNDING 
NEARLY TRIPLE ACROSS SOME PARTS OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY AS LOW LEVEL 
FLOW OFF THE GULF INCREASES. APPROACHING LOW DOES WEAKEN SOMEWHAT  
WITH TIME AS IT BEGINS TO PHASE WITH A TROF MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES STATES.

ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW AND COLD FRONT MOVE INTO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA BY 
LATE WEDNESDAY AND ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
EARLY THURSDAY. TO COMPLICATE MATTERS...A STRONG CANADIAN COLD FRONT 
IS LITERALLY ON THE HEELS OF THE FIRST FRONT AND APPEARS TO ABSORB 
IT BY THURSDAY MORNING AS IT SWEEPS ACROSS THE STATE. 

APPROACHING SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY QUITE DYNAMIC WITH PLENTY OF LOW 
LEVEL CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT...GOOD VERTICAL VELOCITY AND SOME 
DECENT...ALBEIT NOT GREAT...UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUANCE. WITH INCREASING 
LOW LEVEL JET AND MOISTURE IN PLACE...RAIN LOOKS LIKELY AREA WIDE. 
BEST DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM PASS TO THE NORTH OF THE 
STATE WITH HIGHER RAINFALL AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO THE NORTH. MODELS 
ALSO KICKING THE SYSTEM OUT A LITTLE FASTER SO WILL NEED TO ADJUST 
POPS UPWARDS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. THUNDERSTORMS ALSO POSSIBLE BUT 
SEVERE WEATHER CONCERN IS LOW. STABILITY IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT 
STRONG WINDS ALOFT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE VIA DOWNDRAFTS IN 
ANY STORM THAT DO DEVELOP. SOME HAIL IS ALSO POSSIBLE AS COLD POOL 
ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LOW SWINGS ACROSS THE NORTH.

MAIN SYSTEM BEGINS TO PULL OUT THURSDAY MORNING WITH PRECIPITATION 
CONTINUING EARLY. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEHIND SYSTEM TO WARRANT 
AT LEAST CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. CONSIDERABLY WEAKER WAVE 
MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL ADD SOME LOW POPS HERE 
EARLY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS FEATURE.  

RATHER TIGHT GRADIENT BEHIND THE FRONT THURSDAY FOR BLUSTERY 
CONDITIONS. A LAKE WIND ADVISORY WILL BE NEEDED IN ALL LIKELIHOOD 
THURSDAY. AS COOL AIR SWEEPS IN...HIGH TEMPERATURES ON THURSDAY 
LIKELY TO OCCUR EARLY WITH STEADY/SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS IN THE 
AFTERNOON.

HIGH BEGINS TO BUILD IN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. GRADIENT WILL 
SLACKEN BUT SOME OF THE COOLEST AIR SO FAR THIS SEASON WILL BE 
COMING IN. SKIES WILL BE MAINLY CLEAR BUT TEMPERATURES NOT EXPECTED 
TO GET OUT OF THE FIFTIES ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. LOWEST 
TEMPERATURES EXPECTED SATURDAY MORNING WITH WIDESPREAD 20S ACROSS 
THE NORTH AND THIRTIES ELSEWHERE. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL NOT BE AS 
LOW SUNDAY MORNING WITH HIGH MOVING TO THE EAST AND RETURN FLOW 
STARTING TO GET REESTABLISHED. WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF MAV/FWC 
NUMBERS.

SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
THE NEW 10.00 GFSLR MODEL RUN IS RATHER INTERESTING WITH A DEEPENING 
CLOSED OFF H5 LOW OVER NORTHERN BAJA. THIS PUTS ARKANSAS UNDER A 
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WITH A SERIES OF VORTS EXPECTED TO APPROACH 
FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND BRING ABOUT PERIODS OF RAIN SUNDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE BACK TO NEAR NORMAL AFTER A BRIEF 
COOL-DOWN.

IS LITERALLY ON THE HEELS OF THE FIRST FRONT AND APPEARS TO ABSORB 
IT BY THURSDAY MORNING AS IT SWEEPS ACROSS THE STATE. 

APPROACHING SYSTEM IS ACTUALLY QUITE DYNAMIC WITH PLENTY OF LOW 
LEVEL CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT...GOOD VERTICAL VELOCITY AND SOME 
DECENT...ALBEIT NOT GREAT...UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUANCE. WITH INCREASING 
LOW LEVEL JET AND MOISTURE IN PLACE...RAIN LOOKS LIKELY AREA WIDE. 
BEST DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM PASS TO THE NORTH OF THE 
STATE WITH HIGHER RAINFALL AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO THE NORTH. MODELS 
ALSO KICKING THE SYSTEM OUT A LITTLE FASTER SO WILL NEED TO ADJUST 
POPS UPWARDS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. THUNDERSTORMS ALSO POSSIBLE BUT 
SEVERE WEATHER CONCERN IS LOW. STABILITY IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT 
STRONG WINDS ALOFT COULD BE BROUGHT TO THE SURFACE VIA DOWNDRAFTS IN 
ANY STORM THAT DO DEVELOP. SOME HAIL IS ALSO POSSIBLE AS COLD POOL 
ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LOW SWINGS ACROSS THE NORTH.

MAIN SYSTEM BEGINS TO PULL OUT THURSDAY MORNING WITH PRECIPITATION 
CONTINUING EARLY. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEHIND SYSTEM TO WARRANT 
AT LEAST CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. CONSIDERABLY WEAKER WAVE 
MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTH THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL ADD SOME LOW POPS HERE 
EARLY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS FEATURE.  

RATHER TIGHT GRADIENT BEHIND THE FRONT THURSDAY FOR BLUSTERY 
CONDITIONS. A LAKE WIND ADVISORY WILL BE NEEDED IN ALL LIKELIHOOD 
THURSDAY. AS COOL AIR SWEEPS IN...HIGH TEMPERATURES ON THURSDAY 
LIKELY TO OCCUR EARLY WITH STEADY/SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS IN THE 
AFTERNOON.

HIGH BEGINS TO BUILD IN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. GRADIENT WILL 
SLACKEN BUT SOME OF THE COOLEST AIR SO FAR THIS SEASON WILL BE 
COMING IN. SKIES WILL BE MAINLY CLEAR BUT TEMPERATURES NOT EXPECTED 
TO GET OUT OF THE FIFTIES ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. LOWEST 
TEMPERATURES EXPECTED SATURDAY MORNING WITH WIDESPREAD 20S ACROSS 
THE NORTH AND THIRTIES ELSEWHERE. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL NOT BE AS 
LOW SUNDAY MORNING WITH HIGH MOVING TO THE EAST AND RETURN FLOW 
STARTING TO GET REESTABLISHED. WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF MAV/FWC 
NUMBERS.

SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
THE NEW 10.00 GFSLR MODEL RUN IS RATHER INTERESTING WITH A DEEPENING 
CLOSED OFF H5 LOW OVER NORTHERN BAJA. THIS PUTS ARKANSAS UNDER A 
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WITH A SERIES OF VORTS EXPECTED TO APPROACH 
FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND BRING ABOUT PERIODS OF RAIN SUNDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE BACK TO NEAR NORMAL AFTER A BRIEF 
COOL-DOWN.

252 AM CST TUE NOV  9 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
HIGH PRESSURE OVER INDIANA WITH RIDGE INTO ARKANSAS WILL KEEP US IN 
A COOL AND DRY WEATHER PATTERN TODAY. THE DRY SPELL WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY OVER MOST OF MY CW AREA...BUT WILL END WHEN 
A SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT APPROACHES AND BRINGS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MY WESTERN AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 
WILL DO ONLY MINOR TWEAKING TO ONGOING FORECAST AS IT SEEMS TO BE 
PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK. BY EARLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE GULF OF MEXICO 
WILL BE WIDE OPEN AS SURFACE HIGH CENTER MOVES EAST OFF THE NORTH 
CAROLINA COAST. SOUTHERLY WINDS AROUND THE PERIFERY OF THE HIGH WILL 
FETCH GULF MOISTURE FROM THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO ACROSS 
EASTERN TEXAS AND INTO PARTS OF OKLAHOMA AND WESTERN ARKANSAS. 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE LIKELY OVER MUCH OF ARKANSAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
PERIODS OF SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY AFTERNOON. SOME RAIN 
WILL LINGER INTO EARLY THURSDAY NIGHT. THE PREFERRED GFS MOS 
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES APPEAR REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE TO THESE. 
SIGNIFICANTLY COLDER WEATHER WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF 
THE NATURAL STATE THURSDAY NIGHT...AND SPREAD TO THE REST OF THE 
STATE BY FRIDAY NIGHT. A FREEZE WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED THURSDAY 
NIGHT. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...
PATTERN CONTINUES TO BECOME INCREASINGLY PROGRESSIVE AT THE START OF 
THE MEDIUM RANGE WITH ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES MOVING 
ACROSS THE REGION ON DAYS SIX AND SEVEN. MODELS MORE INCONSISTENT 
THIS MORNING HANDLING THIS SYSTEM VERSUS DAYS PAST WITH STRENGTH OF 
THE APPROACHING WAVE SEEING THE LARGEST DISCREPANCIES. WITH NO REAL 
CONFIDENCE IN ANY OF THE MODELS...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS 
THIS MORNING.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL STILL BE DOMINATING ON SATURDAY WITH 
MODERATE RIDGING OVER THE NATIONS MID SECTION ANCHORED BY LONG WAVE 
TROUGHS ON EITHER SIDE OF IT. FULL LATITUDE TROF OVER THE ROCKIES 
EARLY SUNDAY MOVES EASTWARD DURING THE DAY AND MOISTURE BEGINS TO 
RETURN TO THE AREA AS SURFACE HIGH SLIDES OFF TO THE EAST AND RETURN 
FLOW GETS REESTABLISHED. WITH APPROACHING TROF...WILL NEED TO BOOST 
POPS ON SUNDAY AS SYSTEM STARTING TO LOOK MORE DYNAMIC. POPS WILL 
ALSO NEED TO BE ADJUSTED UPWARDS ON DAY SEVEN AS MODELS NOW SHOWING 
INVERTED TROF OVER THE AREA WITH WEAK LOW PRESSURE SOMEWHERE OVER 
CENTRAL OR SOUTHERN LOUISIANA AND THE RATHER BEEFY LOOKING TROUGH ON 
OUR DOORSTEP.

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE BELOW NORMAL THROUGH OUT THE PERIOD 
BUT LATEST GUIDANCE KEEPS TEMPERATURES JUST WARM ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE 
ANY MIXED PRECIP OVER THE NORTH. COLDEST DAY WILL BE SATURDAY IN 
SPITE OF ALMOST FULL SUNSHINE WITH TEMPERATURES SLOWLY CRAWLING 
UPWARDS FOR DAYS SIX AND SEVEN. MEX NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE AND ARE 
GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
252 AM CST TUE NOV  9 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
HIGH PRESSURE OVER INDIANA WITH RIDGE INTO ARKANSAS WILL KEEP US IN 
A COOL AND DRY WEATHER PATTERN TODAY. THE DRY SPELL WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY OVER MOST OF MY CW AREA...BUT WILL END WHEN 
A SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT APPROACHES AND BRINGS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MY WESTERN AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 
WILL DO ONLY MINOR TWEAKING TO ONGOING FORECAST AS IT SEEMS TO BE 
PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK. BY EARLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE GULF OF MEXICO 
WILL BE WIDE OPEN AS SURFACE HIGH CENTER MOVES EAST OFF THE NORTH 
CAROLINA COAST. SOUTHERLY WINDS AROUND THE PERIFERY OF THE HIGH WILL 
FETCH GULF MOISTURE FROM THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO ACROSS 
EASTERN TEXAS AND INTO PARTS OF OKLAHOMA AND WESTERN ARKANSAS. 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE LIKELY OVER MUCH OF ARKANSAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
PERIODS OF SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY AFTERNOON. SOME RAIN 
WILL LINGER INTO EARLY THURSDAY NIGHT. THE PREFERRED GFS MOS 
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES APPEAR REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE TO THESE. 
SIGNIFICANTLY COLDER WEATHER WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF 
THE NATURAL STATE THURSDAY NIGHT...AND SPREAD TO THE REST OF THE 
STATE BY FRIDAY NIGHT. A FREEZE WARNING MAY BE REQUIRED THURSDAY 
NIGHT. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...
PATTERN CONTINUES TO BECOME INCREASINGLY PROGRESSIVE AT THE START OF 
THE MEDIUM RANGE WITH ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES MOVING 
ACROSS THE REGION ON DAYS SIX AND SEVEN. MODELS MORE INCONSISTENT 
THIS MORNING HANDLING THIS SYSTEM VERSUS DAYS PAST WITH STRENGTH OF 
THE APPROACHING WAVE SEEING THE LARGEST DISCREPANCIES. WITH NO REAL 
CONFIDENCE IN ANY OF THE MODELS...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS 
THIS MORNING.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL STILL BE DOMINATING ON SATURDAY WITH 
MODERATE RIDGING OVER THE NATIONS MID SECTION ANCHORED BY LONG WAVE 
TROUGHS ON EITHER SIDE OF IT. FULL LATITUDE TROF OVER THE ROCKIES 
EARLY SUNDAY MOVES EASTWARD DURING THE DAY AND MOISTURE BEGINS TO 
RETURN TO THE AREA AS SURFACE HIGH SLIDES OFF TO THE EAST AND RETURN 
FLOW GETS REESTABLISHED. WITH APPROACHING TROF...WILL NEED TO BOOST 
POPS ON SUNDAY AS SYSTEM STARTING TO LOOK MORE DYNAMIC. POPS WILL 
ALSO NEED TO BE ADJUSTED UPWARDS ON DAY SEVEN AS MODELS NOW SHOWING 
INVERTED TROF OVER THE AREA WITH WEAK LOW PRESSURE SOMEWHERE OVER 
CENTRAL OR SOUTHERN LOUISIANA AND THE RATHER BEEFY LOOKING TROUGH ON 
OUR DOORSTEP.

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE BELOW NORMAL THROUGH OUT THE PERIOD 
BUT LATEST GUIDANCE KEEPS TEMPERATURES JUST WARM ENOUGH TO PRECLUDE 
ANY MIXED PRECIP OVER THE NORTH. COLDEST DAY WILL BE SATURDAY IN 
SPITE OF ALMOST FULL SUNSHINE WITH TEMPERATURES SLOWLY CRAWLING 
UPWARDS FOR DAYS SIX AND SEVEN. MEX NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE AND ARE 
GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED

955 PM CST SUN NOV  7 2004

.DISCUSSION...
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES WEAK COLD FRONT FROM SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS...EXTENDING INTO NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. DRIER AIR CONTINUES 
TO MOVE DOWN FROM THE MOUNTAINS. SURFACE OBS REVEAL 16 DEGREE 
DEWPOINT GRADIENT BETWEEN HARRISON AND LITTLE ROCK. THIS DRY AIR 
WILL CONTINUE MOVING SOUTHWARD TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE IN 
BEHIND THE SYSTEM...PUSHING THE FRONT OUT OF THE AREA. 

TEMPERATURES HAVE LEVELLED OFF DURING THE LAST COUPLE OF HOURS. SOME 
STATIONS HAVE ACTUALLY RISEN A DEGREE OR TWO. WILL AT THIS TIME 
MAINTAIN CURRENT FORECAST OF LOWER 40S NORTH TO NEAR 50 SOUTH. 
EXPECTED GRADIENT TONIGHT SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES IN CHECK...THOUGH 
VALLEYS OF NORTHERN ARKANSAS MAY SEE READINGS A COUPLE OF DEGREES 
LOWER. 

UPDATED GRIDS AND GRAPHICS HAVE BEEN SENT. NO UPDATES NECESSARY TO 
TEXT FORECASTS AT THIS TIME.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE AREA WILL PUT THE AREA UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF A SURFACE HIGH TO THE NORTH. THIS HIGH WILL SHIFT 
EAST BUT A RIDGE WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA AT LEAST THROUGH
TUESDAY AND POSSIBLY WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL KEEP THE GULF OF MEXICO 
CLOSED OFF AND KEEP COOL AND DRY WEATHER FOR THE AREA. MADE LITTLE
CHANGE TO TEMP FORECASTS THROUGH TUESDAY AS TEMPS WERE CLOSE TO MOS. 
STILL SOME TIMING QUESTIONS CONCERNING THE UPPER TROF COMING OUT
OF THE SOUTHWEST INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY AROUND MIDWEEK. 
LOOKS NOW LIKE THE BEST MOISTURE AND PVA FROM THE TROF STAY TO 
THE WEST OF THE CWA THROUGH WEDNESDAY SO WILL KEEP RAIN OUT OF THE
FORECAST THROUGH THEN. INCREASED POPS TO 40 PERCENT FROM THE WEST 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE TROF AND COLD FRONT MOVE THROUGH THE AREA.
PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE MOISTURE INCREASE WILL NOT BE TREMENDOUS
SO DO NOT LOOK FOR HEAVY RAIN AT THIS TIME. ALSO INSTABILITY LOOKS
MARGINAL. WENT WITH SHOWERS/THUNDER FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT FOR NOW
BUT ANY THUNDER WOULD LIKELY BE ISOLATED OR EMBEDDED.     

SHORT WAVE WILL CROSS THE STATE FROM WEST TO EAST ON THURSDAY AS IT 
GETS ABSORBED IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW THAT WILL DEVELOP IN ADVANCE 
OF THE LONG WAVE TROF DIGGING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND THE 
NORTHEAST FOR THE WEEK END. THE CUT OFF LOW OUT WEST OPENS UP AND IT 
GETS SHOVED EAST BY THE NEXT TROF DIGGING OVER THE WEST COAST 
SATURDAY. A SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL BE DROPPING SOUTHEAST ACROSS 
ARKANSAS AS A WEAK LOW DIVES OVER THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE STATE 
EARLY ON THURSDAY. SINCE THE SURFACE LOW WILL BE SOUTH OF ARKANSAS 
WHILE THE UPPER VORT WEAKENS...I DECIDED TO INCLUDE ONLY SHOWERS 
WITH THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE. DRY AIR WILL MOVE OVER ARKANSAS BRIEFLY 
ON SATURDAY...AND THEN MOISTURE WILL RETURN PROMPTLY FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST SUNDAY.

COLD FRONT IN NORTHERN PART OF THE CWA MOVING SOUTH A LITTLE SLOWER
THAN EXPECTED. THIS DRY PASSAGE DURING THE DAY WITH MOSTLY SUNNY
SKIES SHOULD ALLOW FOR A STRONG WARMUP...LIKELY MORE THAN THOUGHT
EARLIER IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS. RAISED MAXES TO NEAR OR A
LITTLE ABOVE 80 IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS FOR THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVEN WENT UPPER 70S IN THE NORTH AS A FEW PLACES THERE MAY 
EASILY WARM UP THAT MUCH BASED ON LATE MORNING TEMPS. EFFECTS OF 
FRONT SHOULD RESULT IN LOWERING DEW POINTS IN NORTHERN AREAS 
IMMEDIATELY AND INTO CENTRAL SECTIONS DURING THE AFTERNOON WHILE
THE SOUTH MAY KEEP HIGHER DEW POINTS MOST OF THE AFTERNOON. WITH
SOME TURBULENT MIXING GOING ON...WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE
DEW POINTS REALLY DROP IN THE NORTH FOR AWHILE THIS AFTERNOON
SO LOWERED DEW POINTS IN THAT AREA INTO THE MID AND UPPER 30S 
WHICH MAY NOT BE LOW ENOUGH. RECOVERY WILL BE LIKELY TOWARD SUNSET.
TEMPS SHOULD DROP RAPIDLY TOWARD SUNSET AND EARLY TONIGHT AS COLD
ADVECTION SETS IN AND DEW POINTS IN NORTH AND CENTRAL MAY COME UP 
A LITTLE BEFORE STARTING TO FALL OFF AGAIN. KEPT FORECAST FOR
TONIGHT AND BEYOND AS IS FOR NOW. FIRST IMPRESSIONS INDICATE NO
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL BE MADE ON THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT
THE DRY SPELL WILL CONTINUE TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY BUT WILL END 
WHEN A SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT APPROACHES AND BRINGS A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS TO MY CW AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BY EARLY WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL BE WIDE OPEN AS SURFACE HIGH CENTER 
MOVES EAST OVER THE CAROLINAS. SOUTHERLY WINDS AROUND THE PERIFERY 
OF THE HIGH WILL FETCH GULF MOISTURE FROM THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO ACROSS EASTERN TEXAS AND INTO PARTS OF OKLAHOMA AND WESTERN 
ARKANSAS. GFS MOS GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES APPEAR REASONABLE.  
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SEEM TO BE IN GENERALLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES. THERE ARE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES AND TO A 
LESSER EXTENT...STRENGTH DIFFERENCES CONCERNING THE APPROACHING MID 
LEVEL LOW. WITH FEATURE HAVING MOVED VERY LITTLE IN THE PAST 24 
HOURS AND STILL SITTING OFF THE SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA COAST...WILL GO 
WITH A BLEND OF ECMWF/GFS MODELS AS THEY SEEM TO HAVE A BETTER 
HANDLE ON ITS CURRENT POSITION. WILL LEAN A TAD TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY 
MORE CONSISTENT GFS SOLUTION.

PERSISTENT RIDGE IN THE NATIONS MID SECTION IS FINALLY BROKEN DOWN 
BY THE APPROACHING UPPER LOW. UPPER LOW WEAKENS CONSIDERABLY BY THE 
TIME IT GETS HERE THURSDAY MORNING AND IS JUST AN FAIRLY STRONG 
OPEN WAVE WHICH PASSES ACROSS SOUTHERN MISSOURI/NORTHERN ARKANSAS 
EARLY IN THE PERIOD. PARENT SURFACE LOW WELL TO THE NORTH OF THE 
AREA. MODELS HAVE COME BACK A LITTLE SLOWER WITH THE ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT AND ARE ALSO SHOWING MORE MOISTURE...LIFT AND CONVERGENCE 
THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. WILL NEED TO HOLD ONTO POPS A LITTLE LONGER ON 
THURSDAY THAN CURRENT FORECAST IS SHOWING BUT CAN STILL ONLY JUSTIFY 
SCATTERED POPS.

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ONTO THE REGION LATE THURSDAY WITH A RATHER 
TIGHT GRADIENT THROUGH MOST OF FRIDAY BEFORE IT RELAXES. BREEZY TO 
WINDY CONDITIONS EXPECTED AS HIGH SETTLES OVER THE REGION. NO 
PRECIPITATION EXPECTED ON DAYS SIX OR SEVEN BUT HIGH IS OFF CANADIAN 
ORIGIN AND COOL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED. CLOUDS AND PRECIP WILL 
KEEP TEMPS DOWN ON THURSDAY AND IN SPITE OF CLEAR SKIES ON DAYS SIX 
AND SEVEN...TEMPERATURES WILL STILL AVERAGE AROUND 10 DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL. LOWS IN THE 30S LIKELY FRIDAY MORNING OVER THE NORTHERN

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
SOUTHWESTERLY GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA BETWEEN A SURFACE HIGH IN 
THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO AND A SURFACE TROF SWINGING TOWARD THE
AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST. THIS SHOULD KEEP LIGHT SOUTHWEST WINDS
GOING TONIGHT WHICH SHOULD KEEP TEMPS UP A LITTLE WITH MOST MINS
IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S. THE WEAK FRONT SWINGS THROUGH EARLY 
SUNDAY AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTH. THIS WILL BRING 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR TO THE AREA. TIMING OF THIS FRONT WILL BE 
CRUCIAL TO TEMPS ON SUNDAY. IF THE NEW BLAST OF COOLER AIR DOES NOT
ARRIVE UNTIL LATER SUNDAY MORNING...TEMPS SHOULD BE ABLE TO WARM 
NICELY AS INDICATED BY MOS. THIS IS OFTEN THE CASE WITH A DRY FRONT
MOVING ACROSS ARKANSAS DURING THE MORNING HOURS DURING THE COOL
SEASON. THUS...WILL GO CLOSE TO MOS ON MAXES. THE DRIER AIR WILL
REALLY MAKE ITSELF PRESENT LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT WITH DEW 
POINTS FALLING INTO THE 30S IN  MOST AREAS. THIS ALONG WITH COLD
ADVECTION SHOULD ALLOW MINS TO FALL INTO THE UPPER 30S AND 
LOWER 40S IN MOST OF THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT THEN MONDAY WILL NOT 
BE AS WARM WITH NORTHEAST WINDS AND A LOWER START TO TEMPS IN 
THE MORNING. THE SURFACE RIDGE HANGS IN THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. THE
UPPER TROF TO THE WEST BEGINS TO APPROACH THE AREA TUESDAY BUT
IT WILL BE AT LEAST WEDNESDAY BEFORE IT HAS AN EFFECT ON THE 
WEATHER IN THE AREA.  
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
THE H5 LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE COUNTRY EVENTUALLY GETS 
EVICTED AND REPLACED BY ANOTHER LOW TUESDAY MORNING. THE LOW DOES 
WEAKEN AS IT TREKS EAST AND DISSIPATES AS STRONG SHORT WAVE IN THE 
NORTHERN STREAM CROSSES THE CANADIAN BORDER BY 00Z THURSDAY. THIS 
SHORT WAVE WILL PROVIDE THE IMPETUS TO A SURFACE FRONT THAT WILL 
DROP SOUTH ACROSS THE UPPER PLAINS BEGINNING WEDNESDAY MORNING AND 
IT WILL SLIDE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND THE MS RIVER 
VALLEY DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS THURSDAY. THE DISPLACING LOW WILL 
PARK ITSELF JUST OF THE SOUTHWEST COAST OF THE COUNTRY BY THURSDAY 
MORNING AND IT WILL REMAIN THERE THROUGH SATURDAY. BACK AT THE 
SURFACE...PLENTY OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL ACCOMPANY THE 
PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY...THEN DRY AIR WILL BE IN 
PLACE OVER ARKANSAS BY 12Z FRIDAY WITH A RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE 
TEXAS PANHANDLE. DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH A 
PROVISO THAT MOISTURE WILL BE POOLING OVER NORTHERN MEXICO AND MUCH 
OF TEXAS JUST BEYOND THIS FORECAST PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
TEMPERED BY CLOUDS AND RAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...WITH A

OVERALL FORECAST LOOKS TO BE IN FINE SHAPE AND ONLY SUPERFICIAL 
CHANGES ARE NEEDED THIS EVENING. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY TELLS THE STORY 
THIS EVENING WITH DEEP TROF CLEARLY SEEN SPINNING OVER WESTERN TEXAS 
WITH A PLUME OF SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE FEEDING INTO THE STATE. SLIVER 
OF DRY AIR ALSO SEEN OVER CENTRAL OKLAHOMA BUT IT APPEARS TO BE 
DECREASING WITH TIME. 

LATEST MODELS KEEP DEEP MOISTURE AND HIGH QPF IN PLACE ALL NIGHT 
OVER THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE. WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE 
CENTRAL SECTION OF THE STATE CRAWLING TO THE EAST. STRONG LOW LEVEL 
INFLOW INTO THE SYSTEM EXPECTED TO PERSIST ALL NIGHT WITH FRONT 
PROVIDING ADEQUATE LIFT FOR CONTINUED TRAINING EFFECT. GFS MODEL 
ALSO SHOWING WEAK LOW PRESSURE FORMING ON THE FRONT OVERNIGHT WITH 
INVERTED SURFACE TROF. 00Z LZK SOUNDING GIVES A PWAT OF 1.80 AND 
PWATS REMAIN BETWEEN 1.5 AND 2.0 INCHES OVER THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST 
ALL NIGHT.

MOVING TO THE NNE. CONVECTION IN ASSOCIATION WITH SURFACE BOUNDARY 
LIFTING OUT OF THE GULF COAST. PROJECTED PATH OF CONVECTION WOULD 
CARRY IT OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS WITH 
ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAINFALL EXPECTED. CURRENT FLASH FLOOD WATCH 
COVERAGE LOOK IDEAL WITH MORE OF A SHOWERY TYPE PRECIP THROUGH THE

EASTERN AREAS WITH LIGHT RAIN IN THE WEST WHICH HAS BEEN DECREASING. 
LOOKS LIKE MOST ACTIVE WEATHER WILL SLOWLY MOVE TO THE EAST OF THE

UPDATE ON THE WAY. WILL SEND OUT THE EVENING UPDATE A LITTLE EARLIER 
THAN NORMAL AS PRECIPITATION IS STARTING AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. OVERALL 
PATTERN PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE IN 
PLACE...SLOW MOVING FRONTAL SYSTEM PROVIDING PLENTY OF LIFT AND VERY 
FAVORABLE JET DYNAMICS ALL COMING INTO PLAY TO PROVIDE HEAVY 
RAINFALL EVENT FOR THE CWA. LATEST UPPER AIR RUN HAS PWAT VALUES UP 
TO 1.5 INCHES..AN INCREASE OF A HALF INCH SINCE THIS MORNING...AND 
EXPECT THIS TO ONLY INCREASE AS THE NIGHT CONTINUES AS WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY SHOWS A STRONG TROPICAL TAP.

PRECIP HAS INITIATED A LITTLE QUICKER THAN ZONES/GRIDS INDICATING 
AND PACKAGE WILL BE UPDATED FOR QUICKER TIMING. WILL ALSO BOOST POPS 
OVERNIGHT AS AREA RADARS ARE BEGINNING TO FILL IN. AREA OF RAIN OVER 
THE SOUTHEAST PERSISTING. POPS AND QPF WILL NEED TO BE UPDATED HERE
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. OTHER CHANGES INVOLVE SOME MINOR 
TWEAKING OF THE CLOUD COVER AND TEMPERATURE GRIDS TO REFLECT CURRENT 
TRENDS.

FLASH FLOOD WATCH SET TO START AT MIDNIGHT AND THIS LOOKS REALLY 
GOOD AND WILL LEAVE IN PLACE. LATEST FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE NOT 
TERRIBLY HIGH AND WITH AMOUNT OF RAIN EXPECTED...SOME PROBLEMS ARE 
LIKELY...ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THE GROUND IS ALREADY SATURATED.

ON AN INTERESTING SIDE NOTE...AFTER THE THIRD DRIEST SEPTEMBER ON 
RECORD...THE SECOND WETTEST OCTOBER IS WRAPPING UP. SO FAR 11.46 
INCHES OF RAIN HAS BEEN RECORDED WHICH IS 7.65 INCHES ABOVE NORMAL 
WITH ABOUT 3 HOURS TO GO.

UPDATE ON THE WAY. WILL SEND OUT THE EVENING UPDATE A LITTLE EARLIER 
THAN NORMAL AS PRECIPITATION IS STARTING AHEAD OF SCHEDULE. OVERALL 
PATTERN PRETTY MUCH THE SAME WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE IN 
PLACE...SLOW MOVING FRONTAL SYSTEM PROVIDING PLENTY OF LIFT AND VERY 
FAVORABLE JET DYNAMICS ALL COMING INTO PLAY TO PROVIDE HEAVY 
RAINFALL EVENT FOR THE CWA. LATEST UPPER AIR RUN HAS PWAT VALUES UP 
TO 1.5 INCHES..AN INCREASE OF A HALF INCH SINCE THIS MORNING...AND 
EXPECT THIS TO ONLY INCREASE AS THE NIGHT CONTINUES AS WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY SHOWS A STRONG TROPICAL TAP.

PRECIP HAS INITIATED A LITTLE QUICKER THAN ZONES/GRIDS INDICATING 
AND PACKAGE WILL BE UPDATED FOR QUICKER TIMING. WILL ALSO BOOST POPS 
OVERNIGHT AS AREA RADARS ARE BEGINNING TO FILL IN. AREA OF RAIN OVER 
THE SOUTHEAST PERSISTING. POPS AND QPF WILL NEED TO BE UPDATED HERE
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. OTHER CHANGES INVOLVE SOME MINOR 
TWEAKING OF THE CLOUD COVER AND TEMPERATURE GRIDS TO REFLECT CURRENT 
TRENDS.

FLASH FLOOD WATCH SET TO START AT MIDNIGHT AND THIS LOOKS REALLY 
GOOD AND WILL LEAVE IN PLACE. LATEST FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE NOT 
TERRIBLY HIGH AND WITH AMOUNT OF RAIN EXPECTED...SOME PROBLEMS ARE 
LIKELY...ESPECIALLY IN AREAS WHERE THE GROUND IS ALREADY SATURATED.

SPRINGLIKE CONDS PERSIST OVR THE FA THIS MRNG WITH TEMPS IN THE MID 
60S TO LOWER 70S. ALREADY SEEING SOME STRATUS FORM OVER THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF WRN AND NRN AR. EXPECT THESE CLOUDS TO CONT FORMING THRU 
SUNRISE OVER MOST AREAS ALONG WITH PTCHY FOG.

ONLY SUPERFICIAL CHANGES NEEDED TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING. WILL 
UPDATE TO REMOVE MENTION OF EVENING WORDING AND REMOVE ALL MENTION 
OF PRECIP. OTHER CHANGES WILL BE NEEDED TO TWEAK CLOUD COVER A BIT 
AND ADJUST THE TEMP GRIDS TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS BUT FORECASTED 
LOWS LOOK REASONABLE.

RIDGE CENTERED IN THE GULF STILL FORECAST TO BUILD NORTHWARD THROUGH 
THE NIGHT WITH THE AXIS SLIGHTLY FURTHER EAST THAN LAST FEW RUNS. 
THIS WILL KEEP THE SOUTHWEST FLOW IN PLACE WITH TEMPERATURES AND 
HUMIDITY LEVELS ABOVE WHERE THEY NORMALLY ARE FOR THIS TIME OF THE 
YEAR. CURRENT THINKING OF A WET PERIOD HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND 
LOOKS GOOD BUT LATEST GFS MODEL HOLDS ONTO THE PRECIP FOR TUESDAY 
INSTEAD OF MOVING IT OUT. WILL HAVE TO LET THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT DECIDE 
WHAT DO DO HERE AS ALL THE NEW MODELS JUST STARTING TO TRICKLE IN.

RIDGING OCCURRING ALOFT AHEAD OF DEEP TROUGH IN THE ROCKIES. THIS 
WILL BRING WARM/MOSTLY DRY WEATHER TO THE REGION THROUGH TONIGHT AND 
MUCH OF FRIDAY.

TROUGH WILL FILL A BIT AS IT HEADS FROM THE ROCKIES INTO THE PLAINS. 
SURFACE FRONT WILL PUSH INTO ARKANSAS FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH BREEZY 
CONDITIONS SURROUNDING THE FRONT. WILL BE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE FRONT. HOWEVER...WITH UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT 
WELL NORTH OF THE STATE...WOULD THINK THAT ANY SEVERE WEATHER WOULD 
BE ISOLATED.

AS UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT MOVES AWAY...FRONT WILL STALL JUST TO THE 
SOUTH OF THE STATE ON SATURDAY. NEW SYSTEM WILL INTENSIFY IN THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS...WHICH WILL INDUCE THE STALLED FRONT TO MOVE BACK 
TO THE NORTH SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY.

SYSTEM IN THE PLAINS WILL DRAG NEW FRONT INTO ARKANSAS SUNDAY 
NIGHT/MONDAY. THIS FRONT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT IT WILL STALL...AND 
WILL BE FOLLOWED BY DRIER/COOLER AIR NEXT WEEK. 

BIG CONCERN IN THE SHORT TERM WILL BE HEAVY RAINFALL. LOTS OF 
MOISTURE SURROUNDING STALLED FRONT OVER THE WEEKEND. AS SYSTEM FROM 
THE PLAINS APPROACHES LATE IN THE WEEKEND...COULD HAVE WIDESPREAD 
HEAVY RAIN EVENT. WILL MONITOR THE SITUATION CLOSELY. (46)

WHICH SHOULD LOWER RAIN CHANCES UNTIL THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES 
LATE FRIDAY. WENT WITH LIKELY POPS EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE NORTH
THEN DECREASED POPS THIS AFTERNOON. AFTER THAT HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY WITH POPS STARTING TO
INCREASE IN THE WEST LATE IN THE DAY. PUT IN PATCHY FOG FOR 
EARLY THIS MORNING BASED ON OBS BUT WILL NEED TO MONITOR OVER
THE NEXT FEW HOURS FOR DEVELOPMENT OF DENSE FOG. RIDGING SHOULD 
HELP CLOUDS BREAK SOME DURING THE AFTERNOON SO WENT CLOSE TO 
MOS ON MAXES FOR TODAY AND FRIDAY WITH MOST AREAS REACHING THE
LOWER 80S. THE NORTH WILL HAVE MORE CLOUDS TODAY AND BETTER CHANCES
OF RAIN THIS MORNING WHICH MAY HOLD MAXES DOWN A LITTLE THERE.

SATURDAY NIGHT AND A WEAK SURFACE HIGH MOVES ACROSS THE AREA.
LOWERED POPS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT CONFINING A SLIGHT CHANCE TO

NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND HUMID AIRMASS. FOR THE MOST PART...AIRMASS 
WILL NOT CHANGE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SHORT TERM...WITH SMALL 
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE REGION.

CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION WILL BE MOSTLY DUE TO STORM SYSTEM HEADING

VERY LITTLE CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS ACROSS 
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AS RIDGE ALOFT STARTS BUILDING FROM GULF COAST 
REGION AND ATMOSPHERE STARTS CAPPING OFF. RIDGE BUILDING IN RESPONSE 
TO DEEPENING TROUGH IN THE ROCKIES.

TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEK...TROUGH TO THE WEST WILL EJECT AND WILL 
START FILLING. LOW PRESSURE IN PLAINS WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT TOWARD 
ARKANSAS. APPEARS THAT FRONT WILL STALL ACROSS THE STATE SATURDAY AS

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY
WARM FRONT APPEARS TO BE MOVING TO THE NORTH AS RIDGING ALOFT DEVELOPS
OVER THE AREA. THIS SHOULD PUSH THE MAIN MOISTURE AXIS TO THE NORTH 
AND BRING THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN TO NORTHERN SECTIONS. STRONG TROPICAL
MOISTURE CONNECTION AIDED BY A TROPICAL DEPRESSION APPEARS TO BE 
SETTING UP FROM OFF THE WEST COAST OF MEXICO THROUGH MEXICO AND THE 
PLAINS BUT IT APPEARS THIS AXIS WILL REMAIN NORTH AND WEST OF THE 
CWA. SEVERAL WEAK SHORT WAVES WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA OVER THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS WITH WARM AND UNUSUALLY HUMID AIR FOR THE END OF 
OCTOBER IN PLACE. THE PRESENCE OF THE HEAVY MOISTURE WILL REQUIRE
POPS IN ALL AREAS BUT WILL GENERALLY GO ONLY 20 PERCENT IN THE 
SOUTH WHERE UPPER HEIGHTS ARE THE HIGHEST. THE HIGHEST POPS WILL
BE IN THE NORTH WITH LIKELY POPS FOR TODAY WHICH LOOKS GOOD BASED ON 
RADAR TRENDS. WILL DECREASE POPS INTO CHANCE RANGE TONIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY. A STRONG UPPER TROF WILL MOVE ACROSS THE PLAINS FRIDAY 
AND WILL BRING A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE AREA. WILL INCREASE POPS 
SOME ON FRIDAY DUE TO THIS. WINDS SHOULD INCREASE ACROSS THE 
AREA FRIDAY AS WELL. CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS SHOULD BE PRESENT THE NEXT 
THREE DAYS. THIS COULD PLAY HAVOC ON MAXES AND WILL GO ON THE COOL 
SIDE OF MOS ON MAXES TODAY BUT CLOSE TO MOS ON MAXES WEDNESDAY
THROUGH FRIDAY. MAXES SHOULD DEFINITELY BE LOWER IN THE NORTH WITH 
BETTER CHANCES OF RAIN. THE HIGH DEW POINTS SHOULD KEEP MINS WELL 
INTO THE 60S IN MOST AREAS.     
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY WITH
A MODEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. DRIER AIR MOVES IN 
ON SATURDAY BUT WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS ANOTHER STRONG TROF DEVELOPS
TO THE WEST RESULTING IN A QUICK TURNAROUND TO RETURN FLOW. THIS 
MAY BRING THE FRONT BACK AS A WARM FRONT SUNDAY AND MOISTURE COVERS 
THE AREA AGAIN. APPEARS A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
AREA ON MONDAY. STRONG DYNAMICS WILL BE CLOSER TO THE AREA SO 
THE SYSTEM WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SIGNIFICANT
SEVERE WEATHER. FOR NOW PUT IN SMALL POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT WITH 
POPS INCREASING TO CHANCE RANGE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.

SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
ALL MEDIUM RANGES MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH NO MAJOR 
DIFFERENCES NOTED. ALL MODELS ARE TRENDING STRONGER AND A LITTLE 
FASTER WITH THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM APPROACHING THE WEST COAST 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK. AS SUCH WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST 
SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE MORE CONSISTENT 
GFS.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES WEAK FRONT SOMEWHERE OVER EXTREME 
SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS AND THROUGH NORTHERN LOUISIANA. THIS BOUNDARY 
WILL BEGIN TO LIFT TOWARDS THE NORTH TONIGHT IN RESPONSE TO 
DEVELOPING WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN. SURFACE HIGH RESPONSIBLE FOR 
THE PLEASANT WEATHER ON SUNDAY MOVES TO THE EAST AND RETURN FLOW 
GETS REESTABLISHED. ADVANCING FRONT WILL ACT AS A FOCUSING MECHANISM 
FOR SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT.

DENSE FOG DEVELOPED OVER THE AREA LAST NIGHT WITH IDEAL RADIATIONAL 
COOLING CONDITIONS. WILL ADD SOME PATCHY FOG TO THE ZONES/GRIDS FOR 
TONIGHT BUT DO NOT BELIEVE IT WILL BE AS WIDESPREAD AND DENSE AS 
THIS MORNING. SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT OVER THE SOUTH 
AS FRONT LIFTS NORTH WITH RAIN CHANCES ADVANCING NORTH DURING THE 
DAY. ONLY CHANCE POPS ARE JUSTIFIED AT THIS POINT. SEVERAL WEAK 
WAVES WILL RIPPLE THROUGH THE SOUTHWEST FLOW. ONE SUCH WAVE COMES 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AND WILL BE AIDED BY AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 
CURRENT PACKAGE HAS HIGH POPS IN THE IN THE MONDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME 
AND SEE NO REASON TO ARGUE.

AMPLIFICATION OF THE OVERALL PATTERN LIKELY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. 
STRONG UPPER LOW APPROACHES THE WEST COAST ON TUESDAY WITH STRONG 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY UNDER CUTTING IT CARVING OUT A LARGE WESTERN TROF. 
UPPER RIDGE CENTERED IN THE CENTRAL GULF EXPANDS NORTHWARD IN 
RESPONSE WITH RELATIVELY MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS IN PLACE. 
PLACEMENT OF THE MAJOR FEATURES WILL KEEP THE AREA IN A PERSISTENT 
SOUTHWEST FLOW THROUGH THE PERIOD. MODELS CONTINUE TO MOVE NUMEROUS 
SHORTWAVES THROUGH HE MEAN FLOW. ONE SUCH WAVE MOVES THROUGH ON 
TUESDAY. AS RIDGE BUILDS THE WAVES ARE SHUNTED EVER SO SLIGHTLY TO 
THE NORTHWEST AND IT APPEARS THIS IS WHERE THE BEST CHANCES OF 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE. WAVES ALSO FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH ON 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. BOTTOM LINE IS AN UNSETTLED FORECAST WITH 
POPS LIKELY THROUGHOUT...HIGHER TO THE NORTHWEST.

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABOVE SEASONABLE NORMS WITH 
PERSISTENT SOUTHWEST FLOW. TEMPERATURES WILL AVERAGE 5 TO 8 DEGREES 
ABOVE NORMAL THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD IN SPITE OF CLOUD COVER AND 
SCATTERED PRECIPITATION. FWC NUMBERS GENERALLY WARMER THAN ITS MAV 
COUNTERPART BUT MAY BE A LITTLE OVERDONE. WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN THE MAV/FWC NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
ONCE MORE WE HAVE AN UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM THAT WEAKENS AS IT MOVES TO 
THE NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE STATE...LEAVING A WEAKENED SHORT WAVE TO

OF PARTS OF THE SOUTH. FOG NOT WIDESPREAD OR DENSE ENOUGH TO 
CONTINUE THE ADVISORY AND WILL COVER WHATS LEFT WITH NOWCASTS. WILL

FOG HAS HAS BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA 
BEFORE DAWN. ISSUED A DENSE FOG ADVISORY UNTIL MID MORNING FOR ALL 
BUT THE EXTREME NORTHERN SECTIONS. ALL UPDATES GONE.

COLD FRONT HAD PRETTY WELL MADE IT THROUGH ARKANSAS EARLY THIS

DEVELOPED OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS EARLY THIS MORNING. PUT 
MENTION OF PATCHY FOG OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS UNTIL 
MID MORNING...OTHERWISE THIS MORNING SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY. 
MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO SLOWLY RETURN FROM THE SOUTH BY THIS 
AFTERNOON AS FRONT STALLS OUT JUST SOUTH OF ARKANSAS. THUS...WILL 
SEE PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS MOVING NORTHWARD THIS AFTERNOON. FRONT 
WILL BEGIN TO MOVE BACK NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT. PUT SMALL 
CHANCES OF RAINFALL OVER THE SOUTH AFTER MIDNIGHT. THEN EXPECT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON MONDAY. MONDAY NIGHT SHOULD 
SEE HEAVIEST RAINFALL AS MOISTURE INCREASES AND ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. WENT WITH LIKELY POPS AREA WIDE 
MONDAY NIGHT...THEN DROPPING BACK TO A CHANCE ON TUESDAY. KEPT SMALL 
POPS IN FOR WEDNESDAY AS AREA REMAINS UNDER SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
204 PM CDT SAT OCT 23 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
MODELS ARE CONTINUING THEIR RECENT TREND OF SLOWING DOWN THE 
ADVANCING H5 TROF. SHORT TERM MODELS ARE ALL SLIGHTLY FURTHER NORTH 
WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THE TROF VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS. GFS A LITTLE 
STRONGER VERSUS ITS ETA COUNTER PART FROM THIS TIME YESTERDAY BUT 
ACTUALLY SEEMS TO BE A BETTER FIT. WITH THE GFS BEING THE PREFERRED 
SOLUTION OF LATE...SEE NO REASON TO DIFFER FROM IT. MESO-ETA ALSO 
HANDLING THE SITUATION WELL AND WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF THOSE TWO 
SOLUTIONS.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS IS SHOWING THE COLD FRONT HAS MADE VERY 
LITTLE EASTWARD PROGRESSION SINCE THIS MORNING. FRONT EXTENDS 
ROUGHLY FROM SPRINGFIELD TO TULSA AND POINTS SOUTH. WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY STILL SHOWING THE SUBTROPICAL TAP WITH DRIER AIR TRYING TO 
WORK IN FROM THE WEST. ENTIRE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE SLOWING UP WITH 
STRONG UPPER LEVEL HIGH SITTING IN THE GULF. FRONT NOT EXPECTED TO 
GET THROUGH THE METRO AREA BEFORE EARLY EVENING AND OUT OF THE 
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE STATE UNTIL MIDNIGHT OR SO. 

SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE OVER MAINLY THE SOUTHEAST 
ZONES WHERE DEEPEST MOISTURE LIES. WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH 
THE MEAN FLOW ALSO HELPING THE PRECIP ALONG. WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
MODELS ARE CONTINUING THEIR RECENT TREND OF SLOWING DOWN THE 
ADVANCING H5 TROF. SHORT TERM MODELS ARE ALL SLIGHTLY FURTHER NORTH 
WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THE TROF VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS. GFS A LITTLE 
STRONGER VERSUS ITS ETA COUNTER PART FROM THIS TIME YESTERDAY BUT 
ACTUALLY SEEMS TO BE A BETTER FIT. WITH THE GFS BEING THE PREFERRED 
SOLUTION OF LATE...SEE NO REASON TO DIFFER FROM IT. MESO-ETA ALSO 
HANDLING THE SITUATION WELL AND WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF THOSE TWO 
SOLUTIONS.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS IS SHOWING THE COLD FRONT HAS MADE VERY 
LITTLE EASTWARD PROGRESSION SINCE THIS MORNING. FRONT EXTENDS 
ROUGHLY FROM SPRINGFIELD TO TULSA AND POINTS SOUTH. WATER VAPOR 
IMAGERY STILL SHOWING THE SUBTROPICAL TAP WITH DRIER AIR TRYING TO 
WORK IN FROM THE WEST. ENTIRE SYSTEM SEEMS TO BE SLOWING UP WITH 
STRONG UPPER LEVEL HIGH SITTING IN THE GULF. FRONT NOT EXPECTED TO 
GET THROUGH THE METRO AREA BEFORE EARLY EVENING AND OUT OF THE 
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE STATE UNTIL MIDNIGHT OR SO. 

SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE OVER MAINLY THE SOUTHEAST 
ZONES WHERE DEEPEST MOISTURE LIES. WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH 
THE MEAN FLOW ALSO HELPING THE PRECIP ALONG. WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS 
THROUGH EVENING HERE. MAIN TROF...CURRENTLY IN THE CENTRAL PLAINS... 
WILL MOVE NORTHEAST WITH AXIS PASSING OVERHEAD SOMETIME THIS EVENING 
BUT DRIER AIR SHOULD BE IN PLACE BY THAT TIME. WITH WIDESPREAD RAIN
LAST NIGHT SOME FOG FORMATION A CONCERN BUT ENOUGH GRADIENT WIND

UPDATE ON THE WAY THIS MORNING. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD 
FRONT WELL OFF TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AREA AND MAKING ONLY SLOW 
PROGRESS AGAINST UPPER LEVEL RIDGING CENTERED IN THE GULF OF MEXICO.
FRONT CURRENTLY EXTENDS FROM NORTHWEST MISSOURI TO SOUTHEAST KANSAS 
TO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW GOOD 
TROPICAL CONNECTION ALL THE WAY TO THE BAJA BUT DRIER AIR IS ALSO 
VERY EVIDENT JUST TO THE WEST OF THE SURFACE BOUNDARY.

VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWING SKIES ALREADY STARTING TO BREAK UP OVER 
NORTHWEST ARKANSAS. LAST OF THE ORGANIZED PRECIP NOW ENTERING 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS WITH JUST SCATTERED PRECIP OVER THE REMAINDER OF 
THE AREA. NEW MESO ETA SEEMS TO HAVE A VERY GOOD HANDLE ON THE 
SITUATION THIS MORNING AND ADVANCES THE DRIER AIR SOUTHWARD THROUGH 
THE CWA THIS AFTERNOON. FRONT BARELY CLEARS THE METRO AREA BY THIS 
EVENING AND DOES NOT EXIT THE STATE UNTIL SUNDAY MORNING.

UPDATE WILL REMOVE POPS FROM THE WEST AND NORTHWEST AREAS AND GO 
WITH A DECREASING TREND ELSEWHERE. WILL HOLD ONTO POPS OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST AND EAST CENTRAL ZONES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY WITH 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY COMING ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST PART OF THE STATE. 
LARGE AREA OF RAIN OVER EASTERN TEXAS AND NORTHERN LOUISIANA 
ASSOCIATED WITH THAT ENERGY ADVANCING TOWARDS SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS. 
CLOUD COVER WILL ALSO NEED TO BE TWEAKED AND TEMPERATURES LOWERED 
ACROSS THE BOARD BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS AND SLOWER THAN EXPECTED 
MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT.

ISSUED AN UPDATE TO TEXT FORECASTS A LITTLE WHILE AGO. WHILE AN 
ISOLATED STRONG STORM OVER THE AREA IS NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION 
TONIGHT...HAVE SERIOUSLY DOWNPLAYED SEVERE WEATHER THREAT. AREA 
REALLY DIDNT BREAK OUT OF THE CLOUDS MUCH TODAY...WHICH SERIOUSLY 
PUT A LID ON SIGNIFICANT WARMING. 00Z LZK SOUNDING STILL SHOWING A 
CAP BETWEEN 750 AND 800 MB. WILL CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT IN THE 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.

AXIS OF HEAVIER RAINFALL WILL SHIFT EASTWARD OVERNIGHT...FOCUSING 
MORE ON CENTRAL AND EASTERN ARKANSAS BY SATURDAY MORNING. STRONG 
STORM OR TWO OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS ON SATURDAY WOULDNT BE TOTALLY 
OUT OF THE QUESTION...THOUGH IT WILL LARGELY DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF 
HEATING OVER THAT AREA DURING THE DAY. 

AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES GO...FORECASTED MINS LOOK TO BE REASONABLE AT 
THIS TIME. HAVE REALIGNED POPS A BIT...TRENDING HEAVIER POPS A 
LITTLE SLOWER EASTWARD DURING THE NIGHT. HAVE DROPPED SEVERE 
MENTION...AND REALIGNED ZONE GROUPS. HAVE ALSO ADJUSTED OTHER

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS THAT THE UPPER PATTERN CONTINUES TO EVOLVE AS 
SHOWN BY PREVIOUS RUNS. RIDGE IS OFFERING RESISTANCE TO THE STRONG 
LOW COMING ACROSS THE ROCKIES INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. EVEN WITH THE 
MAIN LOW CUTTING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES AREAS...THERE WILL 
BE A SIGNIFICANT LOBE OF ENERGY TO PUSH ACROSS AR AND OK FOR THE 
WEEK END. SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL RETURN TO OUR AREA AFTER A BRIEF 
PERIOD OF ZONAL FLOW AND AS THE RIDGE AMPLIFIES ONCE MORE IN ADVANCE 
OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. THE SURFACE PATTERN STILL HAS A DRY RIDGE MOVING 
ACROSS ARKANSAS AFTER SATURDAYS FRONTAL PASSAGE. SURFACE HIGH WILL 
REGAIN ITS STRENGTH AS A REFLECTION OF THE UPPER RIDGE. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN POOL OF MOISTURE MOVING BACK OVER AR FROM THE SOUTHWEST 
FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. PRECIPITATION WILL NEVER BE TO FAR FROM OUR 
WESTERN BORDER...SO A WET PATTERN WILL PERSIST BEYOND TUESDAY NIGHT.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE DIFFICULT IN LIGHT OF UPCOMING RAINFALL AND 
FRONT. FORECAST WILL TEND TO HAVE COOLER HIGHS FOR THE FIRST PART OF 
THE WEEK END UNTIL THE DRY AIR GETS HERE FOR SUNDAY WHEN THERE WILL 
BE WIDER DIURNAL FLUCTUATIONS. LOWS WILL BE KEPT WARM TONIGHT BY 
HIGH DEW POINTS...THEN DRIER AIR WILL ALLOW RADIATIONAL COOLING. 
RAIN CHANCES WILL BE CATEGORICAL ACROSS THE NORTH TONIGHT AND TAPER 
TO LIKELY OVER THE CENTRAL SECTIONS AND A GOOD CHANCE SOUTH. THEN 
RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHER OVER THE SOUTH SATURDAY AND DECREASE 
NORTHWARD. SUNDAY WILL HAVE A DRY FORECAST. RAIN TO RETURN OVERNIGHT 
SUNDAY FROM THE SOUTHWEST AND IT WILL LINGER INTO TUESDAY IN 
SCATTERED FASHION. INITIALLY I HAD EXPECTED OVER-RUNNING RAINS ONLY 
FOR MONDAY...BUT THERE MAY BE ENOUGH ELEVATED INSTABILITY TO CREATE 
SOME CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY...SO WILL STICK WITH CONVECTION.
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
MODELS ARE IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON VERSUS THIS TIME 
YESTERDAY. WHILE GFS HAS BEEN HOLDING SERVE AND CHANGING VERY 
LITTLE...THE OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS HAVE BEEN WAFFLING SOMEWHAT. 
IT APPEARS THAT WHILE THE OTHER MODELS ARE NOW ON THE SAME PAGE AS 
THE GFS...THEY HAVE BEEN PLAYING CATCH UP. ALL THAT BEING SAID...THE 
GFS SOLUTION SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO GO.

OVERALL PATTERN SHOULD BE FAIRLY ACTIVE WITH PERSISTENT WESTERN 
CONUS TROFFING AND RIDGING ALONG THE CENTRAL GULF COAST. PLENTY OF 
GULF MOISTURE COMING UP WHICH IS AIDED BY A SURFACE HIGH OVER THE 
NORTHERN LAKES. MODELS CARRY A WARM FRONT THROUGH THE AREA IN THE 
LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME SO POPS FROM TUESDAY 
NIGHT WILL BE EXTENDED. ONCE THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH...A FEW WEAK 
SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE THROUGH IN THE RESULTANT SOUTHWEST FLOW FOR A 
CONTINUATION OF SCATTERED POPS. STRONG SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO THE 
DESERT SOUTHWEST THURSDAY. SYSTEM FLATTENS OUT THE RIDGE SOMEWHAT 
BUT A CONTINUATION OF SCATTERED POPS IS WARRANTED. A BROAD WESTERN 
CONUS TROF FOR FRIDAY WILL MAINTAIN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW OVER THE 
AREA. A SURFACE LOW MOVING THROUGH THE WESTERN LAKES WILL DRAG A 
COLD FRONT THROUGH FRIDAY FOR EVEN MORE UNSETTLED WEATHER.

WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW IN PLACE TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES 
ABOVE SEASONABLE NORMS...DESPITE THE SHOWERY AND CLOUDY CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED. MEX NUMBERS IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND HAVE GENERALLY BEEN 
CONSISTENT SO THEY WILL BE FOLLOWED FAIRLY CLOSELY.

NORTHERN LAKES. MODELS CARRY A WARM FRONT THROUGH THE AREA IN THE 
LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME SO POPS FROM TUESDAY 
NIGHT WILL BE EXTENDED. ONCE THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH...A FEW WEAK 
SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE THROUGH IN THE RESULTANT SOUTHWEST FLOW FOR A 
CONTINUATION OF SCATTERED POPS. STRONG SHORTWAVE MOVES INTO THE 
DESERT SOUTHWEST THURSDAY. SYSTEM FLATTENS OUT THE RIDGE SOMEWHAT 
BUT A CONTINUATION OF SCATTERED POPS IS WARRANTED. A BROAD WESTERN 
CONUS TROF FOR FRIDAY WILL MAINTAIN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW OVER THE 
AREA. A SURFACE LOW MOVING THROUGH THE WESTERN LAKES WILL DRAG A 
COLD FRONT THROUGH FRIDAY FOR EVEN MORE UNSETTLED WEATHER.

ABOVE SEASONABLE NORMS...DESPITE THE SHOWERY AND CLOUDY CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED. MEX NUMBERS IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND HAVE GENERALLY BEEN

WILL REQUIRED A SIGNIFICANT LOWERING OF TEMPERATURES INTO THE 60S 
MAINLY FOR HIGHS RATHER THAN THE 70S AND A FEW 80S IN THE FORECAST 
FOR THE SOUTH. PRECIPITATION WILL STILL MOVE INTO THE WESTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE STATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING...HOWEVER 
THE FRONT WILL ACROSS THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE STATE AROUND 18Z 
AND IT WILL BE ABOUT TO CROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY 00Z SUN. 
MOISTURE WILL LINGER JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE STATE AND BACK TOWARDS 
NORTHEAST TEXAS. SURFACE RIDGE OVER ARKANSAS WILL RETARD THE RETURN 
OF THIS MOISTURE UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT FOR THE SOUTHWEST AND FOR THE 
ENTIRE STATE FOR MONDAY. CLOUDS WILL PERSIST THROUGHOUT MONDAY NIGHT 
WHILE PRECIPITATION WILL SLACKEN.

LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ARE AGAIN ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING. MOST 
DENSE FOG IS IN OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES SO HAVE ISSUED A DENSE FOG 
ADVISORY THERE. STATIONARY FRONT IS ACROSS NORTHERN LOUISIANA AND 
HAS NOT REALLY MOVED OVERNIGHT. SOME DRIZZLE IS ALSO BEING REPORTED. 
DRIZZLE AND FOG SHOULD END THIS MORNING.

UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. THE 
FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT. THIS WILL 
EVENTUALLY HELP BRING THE FRONT NORTH ON FRIDAY. AS THIS OCCURS A 
COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE WEST EARLY FRIDAY. THIS WILL 
SPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA. INCREASED POPS 
ALONG THE FRONT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE IN FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY.

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL MOVE TO THE NORTH BACK ACROSS THE 
AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY THEN WILL BE NORTH OF THE AREA 
AFTER THAT WITH RATHER STRONG SOUTHWEST FLOW SETTING UP. 
KEPT SMALL POPS IN FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.
RATHER GOOD MOISTURE REMAINS IN PLACE TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY

KEEP AREAS NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY COOLER. FORECASTED MINS LOOK TO BE 
IN GREAT SHAPE...SO NO CHANGES NEEDED THERE.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
THE UPPER FLOW WILL CONTINUE AMPLIFYING THE RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL 
AND EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE COUNTRY DURING THIS PERIOD. IN THE 
MEANTIME THE STRONG LOW OVER SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA MOVES EAST AND 
WEAKENS AS IT GETS CAUGHT IN THE STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW RESULTING 
FROM THE STRONG RIDGE HOLDING ITS GROUND. THE GFS RE-STRENGTHENS THE 
SHOT OF ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE CENTRAL SECTION OF THE COUNTRY 
OVER KANSAS BY 00Z SATURDAY BUT THE RIDGE DEFLECTS IT AWAY FROM 
AR...PLACING IT OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST BY SATURDAY MORNING. FROM 12Z 
SAT TO 12Z MON...THE FLOW GETS BACK TO A ZONAL CONFIGURATION. THE 
RESULT OF ALL THIS RIDGING AND DEFLECTING WILL BE TO SLOW DOWN THE 
PROGRESS OF THE SURFACE FRONT TO MORE FAVORABLE HOURS FOR AR TO 
MINIMIZE SEVERE WEATHER SINCE IT WILL CROSS OVERNIGHT FRIDAY INTO 
SATURDAY MORNING. ALSO...THE SOUTHERN END WILL LOSE ITS OOMPH AND 
LEAVE MOISTURE POISED JUST SOUTH OF OUR BORDERS...READY TO RETURN ON 
THE BACK SIDE OF THE NEXT HIGH THAT WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE MO 
BOOTHEEL. I WILL REINTRODUCE SMALL POPS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ON 
SUNDAY NIGHT. WEATHER-WISE...OUR LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ARE QUITE LIKELY 
TO RETURN SOON TONIGHT WITH PROLONGED EASTERLY WINDS AND UNDER PESKY 
INVERSION. TEMPS WILL TREND TOWARD THE GFS NUMBERS SINCE IT IS 
HANDLING THE SITUATION BETTER.
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
GFS SOLUTION HAS DONE A GOOD JOB WITH THE OVERALL PATTERN OF LATE 
AND STILL SEEMS TO BE THE BEST WAY TO GO. ONLY CHANGE OF NOTE IS THE 
MODEL HAS TRENDED JUST A LITTLE FASTER WITH ALL MAJOR FEATURES BUT 
CHANGES TO THE SENSIBLE WEATHER WILL BE SUPERFICIAL AT BEST.

PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EXTENDED WITH A SERIES 
OF SYSTEMS COMING ON SHORE ALONG THE WEST COAST WITH THE NORTHERN 
STREAM APPEARING TO BE MORE ACTIVE THROUGH THE PERIOD. HIGH PRESSURE 
MOVES INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH RETURN FLOW 
SETTING UP. REMNANTS OF AN OLD STATIONARY BOUNDARY STILL LURKING 
ACROSS NORTHERN LOUISIANA...WILL NEED TO KEEP SLIGHT CHANCES POPS IN 
FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. 

UPPER LOWS WILL BE LOCATED OVER NEW ENGLAND AND THE WASHINGTON COAST 
BY THE END OF TUESDAY WITH RIDGING PUMPING UP OVER THE NATIONS MID 
SECTION IN RESPONSE. MODELS TRY TO MOVE A WEAK FRONT THROUGH ON 
TUESDAY BUT ITS EFFECT APPEARS MINIMAL. AS WASHINGTON LOWS DIGS DOWN 
THE WEST COAST...RIDGE STRENGTHENS CONSIDERABLY FOR WEDNESDAY AND AS 
SUCH WILL GO WITH DRY CONDITIONS BOTH DAYS SIX AND SEVEN. 
TEMPERATURES CURRENTLY IN THE EXTENDED LOOK REASONABLE AND WILL BE 
LEFT IN PLACE. NUMBERS AGREE FAIRLY WELL WITH MEX GUIDANCE AND ARE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
1110 AM CDT WED OCT 20 2004

SOUNDING SHOWS QUITE STRONG INVERSION THAT WILL TRAP THE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE MUCH LONGER THAN EXPECTED EARLIER...SO MADE ADJUSTMENTS TO 
KEEP FOG AND CLOUDS. TO GO ALONG WITH THAT...I HAD TO LOWER 
TEMPERATURES FOR TODAYS HIGHS. PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS (32).

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY
THE COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM NEAR DEQUEEN TO NORTH OF PINE BLUFF TO 
NEAR MEMPHIS. NORTHEAST WINDS ARE ACROSS THE NORTH AND CENTRAL 
SECTIONS WITH SOUTH WINDS ACROSS MOST SOUTHERN LOCATIONS. COOL DRY 
AIR HAS MADE IT INTO CENTRAL AND PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS. 
THIS WILL IMPACT THE MAX TEMPERATURES ACROSS NORTH AND CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS ESPECIALLY. LOWERED MAX TEMPS IN MOST LOCATIONS WITH THE 
BIGGEST DECREASE ACROSS THE NORTH. SHOULD ONLY SEE TEMPS AROUND 70 
DEGREES AT HARRISON. LOW STRATUS CLOUDS HAVE MOVED BACK INTO THIS 
AREA AND WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES COOL IN THIS AREA. LATEST SATELLITE 
IMAGES SHOW LOW STRATUS MOVING INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS FROM THE 
NORTHEAST AND INTO SOUTH ARKANSAS FROM THE SOUTH...SO WILL ADJUST 
GRIDS ACCORDINGLY.

A FEW SHOWERS MOVED ACROSS NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF ARKANSAS EARLY THIS 
MORNING BUT HAVE DISSIPATED OR MOVED EAST OF THE CWFA. WILL NOT 
MENTION ANY POPS TODAY AS PRECIP WILL BE JUST EAST OF CWFA. 

A SURFACE LOW IS CENTERED IN SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS ALONG THE 
AFOREMENTIONED FRONT. WILL STAY CLOSE TO THE CONSISTENT GFS SOLUTION 
FOR THIS PACKAGE. AN UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA TONIGHT 
AND THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH BRINGING WARMER MORE HUMID AIR 
NORTHWARD. A DEVELOPING COLD FRONT IN THE ROCKIES WILL HEAD FOR 
ARKANSAS ON THURSDAY. WILL BEGIN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE WEST AND NORTHWEST EARLY FRIDAY 
MORNING...AND PROGRESS THEM EASTWARD AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE 
AREA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY 
AND FRIDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT SHOULD ENTER THE NORTHWEST CORNER FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND BE THROUGH THE STATE BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE OVER THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT
INTO SUNDAY AND THIS SHOULD BRING DRY AND COOL WEATHER. LOWERED 
MIN TEMPS AND DEW POINTS DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS HIGH MOVES TO
THE EAST SUNDAY NIGHT WITH SOME RETURN FLOW COMING AROUND IT BUT
THE NEW GFS NOW INDICATES ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH
ON MONDAY. CONTINUED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT FOR THIS. THIS HIGH SLIDES TO THE EAST TUESDAY WITH RETURN
FLOW BRINGING GOOD MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL
BE TO THE WEST OF THE AREA HOWEVER WHICH MAY INHIBIT MUCH IN THE 
WAY OF PRECIPITATION. WENT WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY FOR 
NOW.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY
THE COLD FRONT EXTENDS FROM NEAR DEQUEEN TO NORTH OF PINE BLUFF TO 
NEAR MEMPHIS. NORTHEAST WINDS ARE ACROSS THE NORTH AND CENTRAL 
SECTIONS WITH SOUTH WINDS ACROSS MOST SOUTHERN LOCATIONS. COOL DRY 
AIR HAS MADE IT INTO CENTRAL AND PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS. 
THIS WILL IMPACT THE MAX TEMPERATURES ACROSS NORTH AND CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS ESPECIALLY. LOWERED MAX TEMPS IN MOST LOCATIONS WITH THE 
BIGGEST DECREASE ACROSS THE NORTH. SHOULD ONLY SEE TEMPS AROUND 70 
DEGREES AT HARRISON. LOW STRATUS CLOUDS HAVE MOVED BACK INTO THIS 
AREA AND WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES COOL IN THIS AREA. LATEST SATELLITE 
IMAGES SHOW LOW STRATUS MOVING INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS FROM THE 
NORTHEAST AND INTO SOUTH ARKANSAS FROM THE SOUTH...SO WILL ADJUST 
GRIDS ACCORDINGLY.

A FEW SHOWERS MOVED ACROSS NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF ARKANSAS EARLY THIS 
MORNING BUT HAVE DISSIPATED OR MOVED EAST OF THE CWFA. WILL NOT 
MENTION ANY POPS TODAY AS PRECIP WILL BE JUST EAST OF CWFA. 

A SURFACE LOW IS CENTERED IN SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS ALONG THE 
AFOREMENTIONED FRONT. WILL STAY CLOSE TO THE CONSISTENT GFS SOLUTION 
FOR THIS PACKAGE. AN UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA TONIGHT 
AND THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH BRINGING WARMER MORE HUMID AIR 
NORTHWARD. A DEVELOPING COLD FRONT IN THE ROCKIES WILL HEAD FOR 
ARKANSAS ON THURSDAY. WILL BEGIN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE WEST AND NORTHWEST EARLY FRIDAY 
MORNING...AND PROGRESS THEM EASTWARD AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE 
AREA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY 
AND FRIDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT SHOULD ENTER THE NORTHWEST CORNER FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND BE THROUGH THE STATE BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE OVER THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT
INTO SUNDAY AND THIS SHOULD BRING DRY AND COOL WEATHER. LOWERED 
MIN TEMPS AND DEW POINTS DURING THIS PERIOD. THIS HIGH MOVES TO
THE EAST SUNDAY NIGHT WITH SOME RETURN FLOW COMING AROUND IT BUT
THE NEW GFS NOW INDICATES ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH
ON MONDAY. CONTINUED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT FOR THIS. THIS HIGH SLIDES TO THE EAST TUESDAY WITH RETURN
FLOW BRINGING GOOD MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL
BE TO THE WEST OF THE AREA HOWEVER WHICH MAY INHIBIT MUCH IN THE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
940 PM CDT TUE OCT 19 2004

.DISCUSSION...
UPDATED FORECASTS TO REMOVE MENTION OF PRECIPITATION FOR OVERNIGHT. 
ALSO INTRODUCED AREAS OF FOG FOR LATE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING. 
LOWERED MINIMUM TEMPERATURES ABOUT ONE CATEGORY IN THE NORTH FOR 
OVERNIGHT. ALL UPDATES GONE.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON IN BOTH INTENSITY AND 
TIMING. ALL ARE ADVERTISING A VERY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WITH A 
TRANSITION FROM NEARLY ZONAL FLOW TO A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED ONE AND THEN 
BACK TO ZONAL. MODELS HAVE SLOWED DOWN THE EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM 
BY ABOUT SIX HOURS VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS. WITH THAT BEING SAID...WILL 
GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACE THE SURFACE BOUNDARY ROUGHLY ALONG A 
JONESBORO TO HOT SPRINGS TO DEQUEEN LINE.. TEMPERATURES AND DEW 
POINTS ACROSS THE BOUNDARY DIFFER BY ABOUT 20 DEGREES. FRONT IS 
SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF SINKING SOUTHWARD WITH VERY WARM AND UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS PROCEEDING IT. LOTS OF SUNSHINE SEEN OVER THE REST OF THE 
STATE WITH AIRMASS LIKELY TO DESTABILIZE EVEN MORE ALONG AND 
PROCEEDING THE FRONT. SCATTERED CONVECTION HAS BEEN OCCURRING ALL 
DAY OVER THE SOUTH EAST AND SEE NO REASON WHY IT WILL NOT CONTINUE 
THROUGH EARLY EVENING AS SPEED MAX LIFTS OUT OF TEXAS. SPECIAL 18Z 
RADIOSONDE RELEASE CONTINUES TO SHOW GOOD SPEED SHEER AND A LITTLE 
BETTER DIRECTIONAL SHEER THAN THE UPPER AIR SOUNDING FROM THIS 
MORNING. ACTIVITY SHOULD BEGIN TO DECREASE AFTER LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING.

FRONT MAKES VERY LITTLE PROGRESS OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO BEFORE 
BECOMING ILL DEFINED OR WASHING OUT COMPLETELY. NEARLY ZONAL PATTERN 
ALOFT WILL BEGIN TO TRANSITION TONIGHT AS UPPER LOW APPROACHES THE 
WEST COAST. AS LOW DIGS OFF THE WEST COAST...RIDGE BEGINS TO PUMP UP 
OVER THE AREA IN RESPONSE. TROF WILL EXTEND FROM BAJA INTO CENTRAL 
CANADA WITH RIDGING FROM THE GULF NORTH TO THE GREAT LAKES STATES BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT.

WITH THE RIDGE OVER HEAD...PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE MINIMAL THROUGH 
MID DAY FRIDAY. MESOETA MOVES A SHORTWAVES TRAPPED UNDER THE RIDGE 
ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON BUT MOISTURE APPEARS 
MINIMAL SO WILL LEAVE POPS OUT.

TROF LIFTS OUT OF THE DESERT SOUTHWEST ON FRIDAY BUT IS SHUNTED 
NORTHEAST BY STRONG MID LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE NATIONS MID SECTION. 
LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS ON THE ASSOCIATED FRONT IN THE LEE OF THE 
ROCKIES FRIDAY MORNING AND RACES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST INTO THE 
WESTERN LAKES BY SATURDAY MORNING. COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY WITH DECENT SURFACE CONVERGENCE AND 
LIFT ALONG THE FRONT ITSELF. BEST DYNAMICS WILL BE OVER THE NORTH 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND HIGHER POPS WILL BE JUSTIFIED HERE STARTING AS 
EARLY AS FRIDAY AFTERNOON OVER THE NORTHWEST. WILL KEEP HIGHER POPS 
ACROSS THE NORTH FRIDAY NIGHT AND OVER THE SOUTH SATURDAY MORNING 
AS FRONT MOVES THROUGH. FRONT CLEARS THE STATE LATE SATURDAY WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN BEHIND IT.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...WITH STRONG RIDGING BUILDING IN AND NO 
APPRECIABLE PUSH OF COOLER AIR...WILL GO ABOVE GUIDANCE OVER THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS. MEX NUMBERS APPEAR MORE REASONABLE ON SATURDAY AND 
WILL LEAN IN THAT DIRECTION.

FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH OF THE STATE SUNDAY...SO REMOVED PRECIP FROM 
THE FORECAST. FRONT WILL MOVE BACK NORTH MONDAY...AND CONTINUED THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. UPPER RIDGE MOVES NORTH TUESDAY FOR A DRY 
FORECAST. TEMPS WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL...WITH READINGS IN

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
238 PM CDT TUE OCT 19 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON IN BOTH INTENSITY AND 
TIMING. ALL ARE ADVERTISING A VERY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WITH A 
TRANSITION FROM NEARLY ZONAL FLOW TO A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED ONE AND THEN 
BACK TO ZONAL. MODELS HAVE SLOWED DOWN THE EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM 
BY ABOUT SIX HOURS VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS. WITH THAT BEING SAID...WILL 
GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACE THE SURFACE BOUNDARY ROUGHLY ALONG A 
JONESBORO TO HOT SPRINGS TO DEQUEEN LINE.. TEMPERATURES AND DEW 
POINTS ACROSS THE BOUNDARY DIFFER BY ABOUT 20 DEGREES. FRONT IS 
SHOWING SOME SIGNS OF SINKING SOUTHWARD WITH VERY WARM AND UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS PROCEEDING IT. LOTS OF SUNSHINE SEEN OVER THE REST OF THE 
STATE WITH AIRMASS LIKELY TO DESTABILIZE EVEN MORE ALONG AND 
PROCEEDING THE FRONT. SCATTERED CONVECTION HAS BEEN OCCURRING ALL 
DAY OVER THE SOUTH EAST AND SEE NO REASON WHY IT WILL NOT CONTINUE 
THROUGH EARLY EVENING AS SPEED MAX LIFTS OUT OF TEXAS. SPECIAL 18Z 
RADIOSONDE RELEASE CONTINUES TO SHOW GOOD SPEED SHEER AND A LITTLE 
BETTER DIRECTIONAL SHEER THAN THE UPPER AIR SOUNDING FROM THIS 
MORNING. ACTIVITY SHOULD BEGIN TO DECREASE AFTER LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING.

FRONT MAKES VERY LITTLE PROGRESS OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO BEFORE 
BECOMING ILL DEFINED OR WASHING OUT COMPLETELY. NEARLY ZONAL PATTERN 
ALOFT WILL BEGIN TO TRANSITION TONIGHT AS UPPER LOW APPROACHES THE 
WEST COAST. AS LOW DIGS OFF THE WEST COAST...RIDGE BEGINS TO PUMP UP 
OVER THE AREA IN RESPONSE. TROF WILL EXTEND FROM BAJA INTO CENTRAL 
CANADA WITH RIDGING FROM THE GULF NORTH TO THE GREAT LAKES STATES BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT.

WITH THE RIDGE OVER HEAD...PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE MINIMAL THROUGH 
MID DAY FRIDAY. MESOETA MOVES A SHORTWAVES TRAPPED UNDER THE RIDGE

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY
AREA OF THUNDERSTORMS HAS SHIFTED TO THE EAST OF THE CWA AT FORECAST 
TIME. SOME DEVELOPMENT HAS OCCURRED IN EASTERN TEXAS WHICH HAS 
SPREAD INTO EXTREME SOUTHWESTERN ARKANSAS. LOOKS LIKE MAIN AXIS OF
PRECIPITATION WILL BE IN SOUTHEASTERN ARKANSAS TODAY WITH DRIER 
AIR IN PLACE TO THE NORTHWEST. A DRY LINE/WEAK FRONT IS IN 
NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS. MODELS IN DISAGREEMENT ON THE BEHAVIOR OF
THIS FRONT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. UPPER RIDGING WILL 
INCREASE OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AND THIS SUGGESTS
THE COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL STAY TO THE NORTH. THUS WENT MORE WITH
THE WARMER GUIDANCE FOR TEMP FORECASTS OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS BUT
DID SHADE DOWN A LITTLE IN THE NORTH. WENT WITH 30 PERCENT POPS IN 
THE SOUTHEAST FOR TODAY AND 20 PERCENT IN SOUTH 
CENTRAL...CENTRAL...AND EASTERN SECTIONS FOR TODAY. CHANCES OF RAIN 
SHOULD DECREASE WITH LOSS OF HEATING AND ONLY KEPT SMALL POPS IN THE 
FAR SOUTHEAST FOR TONIGHT. WITH UPPER RIDGING BUILDING IN ON 
WEDNESDAY AND NO SIGNIFICANT FORCING THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD BECOME 
CAPPED AND DROPPED MENTION OF RAIN THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. UPPER 
TROF TO THE WEST WILL APPROACH FRIDAY AND A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
TOWARD THE AREA. PUT IN SMALL POPS FOR FRIDAY DUE TO THIS WITH THE 
BETTER CHANCES OF RAIN LIKELY COMING AFTER FRIDAY.      
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BE SLIDING EAST OF THE AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT. 
THIS WILL ALLOW A COLD FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY. THE SURFACE AND UPPER LOW WILL REMAIN NORTH OF 
ARKANSAS. WITH WARM TEMPERATURES AND ABUNDANT MOISTURE AVAILABLE 
WITH THE SOUTHWEST FLOW...DECIDED TO INCREASE POPS TO HIGH CHANCE 
ACROSS THE AREA ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT. GFS IS SHOWING SOME 
STRONG DRYING BEHIND THE FRONT SATURDAY NIGHT. THEREFORE DECIDED TO 
REMOVE POPS SUNDAY MORNING. WILL PROGRESS THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FROM SOUTH TO NORTH SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THE FRONT MAY STALL IN 
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS BEFORE MOVING BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. 

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD WITH HIGHS MAINLY IN THE 70S AND A FEW 80S SOUTH. DEW POINTS 
WILL REMAIN IN THE 50S AND 60S.

400 AM CDT TUE OCT 19 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY
AREA OF THUNDERSTORMS HAS SHIFTED TO THE EAST OF THE CWA AT FORECAST 
TIME. SOME DEVELOPMENT HAS OCCURRED IN EASTERN TEXAS WHICH HAS 
SPREAD INTO EXTREME SOUTHWESTERN ARKANSAS. LOOKS LIKE MAIN AXIS OF
PRECIPITATION WILL BE IN SOUTHEASTERN ARKANSAS TODAY WITH DRIER 
AIR IN PLACE TO THE NORTHWEST. A DRY LINE/WEAK FRONT IS IN 
NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS. MODELS IN DISAGREEMENT ON THE BEHAVIOR OF
THIS FRONT OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. UPPER RIDGING WILL 
INCREASE OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AND THIS SUGGESTS
THE COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL STAY TO THE NORTH. THUS WENT MORE WITH
THE WARMER GUIDANCE FOR TEMP FORECASTS OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS BUT
DID SHADE DOWN A LITTLE IN THE NORTH. WENT WITH 30 PERCENT POPS IN 
THE SOUTHEAST FOR TODAY AND 20 PERCENT IN SOUTH 
CENTRAL...CENTRAL...AND EASTERN SECTIONS FOR TODAY. CHANCES OF RAIN 
SHOULD DECREASE WITH LOSS OF HEATING AND ONLY KEPT SMALL POPS IN THE 
FAR SOUTHEAST FOR TONIGHT. WITH UPPER RIDGING BUILDING IN ON 
WEDNESDAY AND NO SIGNIFICANT FORCING THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD BECOME 
CAPPED AND DROPPED MENTION OF RAIN THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. UPPER 
TROF TO THE WEST WILL APPROACH FRIDAY AND A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
TOWARD THE AREA. PUT IN SMALL POPS FOR FRIDAY DUE TO THIS WITH THE 
BETTER CHANCES OF RAIN LIKELY COMING AFTER FRIDAY.      
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BE SLIDING EAST OF THE AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT. 
THIS WILL ALLOW A COLD FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY. THE SURFACE AND UPPER LOW WILL REMAIN NORTH OF 
ARKANSAS. WITH WARM TEMPERATURES AND ABUNDANT MOISTURE AVAILABLE 
WITH THE SOUTHWEST FLOW...DECIDED TO INCREASE POPS TO HIGH CHANCE 
ACROSS THE AREA ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT. GFS IS SHOWING SOME 
STRONG DRYING BEHIND THE FRONT SATURDAY NIGHT. THEREFORE DECIDED TO 
REMOVE POPS SUNDAY MORNING. WILL PROGRESS THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FROM SOUTH TO NORTH SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THE FRONT MAY STALL IN 
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS BEFORE MOVING BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. 

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD WITH HIGHS MAINLY IN THE 70S AND A FEW 80S SOUTH. DEW POINTS 
WILL REMAIN IN THE 50S AND 60S.

IN SALINE COUNTY.

WARM FRONT IN SOUTHERN MISSOURI...WITH A DRY LINE IN EASTERN 
OKLAHOMA. DRY LINE WILL MOVE EAST LATE THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY TONIGHT. 
ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP THIS 
EVENING...BUT NOT LOOKING AT WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER. COULD SEE 
SOME HEAVY RAINFALL AGAIN...ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHWEST...BUT DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY...HAVE NOT INCLUDED IN ZONES. DID INCREASE QPF AMOUNTS 
THOUGH.

ACTIVITY WILL MOVE TO THE EAST/NORTHEAST TUESDAY AS UPPER TROUGH 
MOVES INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION. KEPT SOME POPS IN THE 
EAST/SOUTHEAST...DECREASING IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS.

DECREASED POPS WEDNESDAY...AS UPPER RIDGE MOVES OVERHEAD AND 
MOISTURE IS LIMITED.. DID NOT FEEL CONFIDENT PULLING POPS ALL 
TOGETHER...BUT SHOWED A DOWNWARD TREND. KEPT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR 
THURSDAY...BUT THESE MAY NEED TO BE DECREASED AS WELL.

NEXT SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE STATE FRIDAY...WITH COLD FRONT ENTERING 
LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON. WITH THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER HEADING TO THE 
NORTHEAST...NOT A LOT OF SUPPORT WITH THIS SYSTEM IN REGARDS TO 
SEVERE WEATHER. STILL ENOUGH LIFT FOR CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE STATE SATURDAY...BUT WILL 
MOVE BACK NORTH ON SUNDAY. DRY WEATHER IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY AS 
UPPER RIDGE MOVES NORTH.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY
WARM FRONT IN SOUTHERN ARKANSAS HAS MOVED NORTH AND MAY BE 
DISSIPATING WITH A NEW WARM FRONT DEVELOPING TO THE NORTH. 
A WARM HUMID AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
AREA TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK. ONE
SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING MAY RESULT
IN THUNDERSTORMS THIS MORNING WHICH MAY WEAKEN/DECREASE DURING 
THE MORNING. NEW THUNDERSTORMS COULD DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON 
AFTER SOME HEATING AND A WEAK DRY LINE MAY MOVE INTO WESTERN 
SECTIONS. INSTABILITY AND SHEAR PRESENT WILL SUPPORT CHANCE OF 
SEVERE STORMS BUT WILL NOT PUT SEVERE WORDING IN ZONES BUT WILL
PLAY UP IN HWO AND WEATHER SUMMARY. HAVE POPS IN CHANCE CATEGORY
IN EAST AND SLIGHT CHANCE IN WEST BASICALLY TODAY AND TONIGHT.
DECREASED POPS A LITTLE FOR AWHILE AROUND MID MORNING TODAY. 
SURFACE LOW BELOW 1000 MB IN SOUTHEASTERN KANSAS THIS MORNING
SHOULD FILL SOMEWHAT AS IT MOVES NORTHEAST. THE PRESENCE OF THE
LOW THAT STRONG SUGGESTS WINDS COULD REACH LAKE WIND ADVISORY 
LEVELS DURING TODAY. WILL GO WITH ADVISORY FROM MID MORNING
THROUGH LATE AFTERNOON ALTHOUGH CLOUDS MAY BE ENOUGH TO HOLD
WINDS BELOW THREASHOLD. WINDS SHOULD DIMINISH LATE THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING AS THE FILLING LOWS PULLS AWAY FROM THE AREA. MAIN
MOISTURE AXIS PUSHES TO THE EAST TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY THEN MAY
DEVELOP A LITTLE BACK TO THE WEST. UPPER RIDGING MAY CAP ATMOSPHERE
AND NO SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVES SUGGEST CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL
BE LOW...BUT THE UNSTABLE AIR MASS PRESENT STILL PRESENTS A CHANCE
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH SOME SEVERE POSSIBLE. GENERALLY
KEP POPS AS THEY WERE FROM TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. GFS BRINGS 
BLOB OF MOISTURE ACROSS THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. 
NO REAL SHORT WAVE OR FRONT IS INDICATED WITH IT BUT WE ALREADY HAVE
ENHANCED POPS OUT FOR THAT TIME PERIOD...SO LEFT THEM GOING. TEMPS
SHOULD SETTLE INTO MINS IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S FOR THE MOST PART
WITH MAXES IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S. THERE MAY BE A WEAK COLD FRONT
MOVE THROUGH THE AREA LATE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WHICH COULD 
BRING SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER AIR TO PARTS OF THE AREA AND 
MADE A SLIGHT DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT TO TEMPS AND DEW POINTS FOR THAT. 
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. 
HOWEVER...ACTIVE WEATHER WILL BE THE GENERAL RULE THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD. SEVERAL SHORT WAVES WILL WORK THEIR WAY THROUGH THE 
REGION BRINGING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. CHANCE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS INCREASES ON SATURDAY AS A COLD FRONT MOVES IN FROM 
THE NORTHWEST. STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL BRING ABUNDANT MOISTURE 
AND ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES TO THE AREA. THE UPPER LOW AND SURFACE 
LOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD FRONT WILL TRACK NORTH OF ARKANSAS. 
THIS WILL BE TOO FAR NORTH FOR WIDESPREAD SEVERE STORMS IN 
ARKANSAS...AS IT STANDS NOW. 

THE COLD FRONT STALLS IN SOUTHERN ARKANSAS SATURDAY NIGHT THEN 
BEGINS MOVING BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. THIS WILL AGAIN 
BRING MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA. AS THE FRONT MOVES

AREA OVERNIGHT TO INCLUDE PARTS OF SOUTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS ALSO. 
UPDATED FORECASTS TO INCREASE AREA OF SEVERE MENTION. ALSO WARM 
FRONT IS NOT MOVING NORTHWARD QUITE AS FAST AS EARLIER EXPECTED...SO 
LOWERED MINIMUM TEMPERATURES DOWN A CATEGORY OR SO...ESPECIALLY OVER 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ARKANSAS. ALL UPDATES GONE.

WARM FRONT QUITE EVIDENT OVER SRN AR THIS AFTN...WITH SFC DEWPOINTS 
APCHG 70F ALONG THE AR/LA BRDR. MEANWHILE...DRIER AIR STILL IN PLACE 
OVER NRN AR WHERE DEWPOINTS STILL IN THE 40S. HAVE SEEN A FEW 
SHOWERS FORM N OF THE BNDRY OVER CNTRL AND SRN SECTIONS.

HAVE CONTD TO FOLLOW ALONG WITH THE ETA SOLUTION FOR THE SHORT TERM 
FCST PD. WARM FRONT WL CONT TO TRACK SLOLY NWD TNGT AND EARLY ON 
MON. EXPECT MIN TEMPS TO OCCUR EARLY TNGT N OF THE BNDRY AND HAVE 
INDCD THIS IN THE HOURLY GRID TEMPS. LOOKING AT STEADY TEMPS TNGT 
FOR LOCATIONS S OF THE FNT.

PRIMARY CONCERN FOR TNGT AND MON CONTS TO BE CONVECTIVE TRENDS. 
INCRSG WAA AND LLJ LATER THIS EVENING WILL ALLOW FOR SHRA/TSRA TO 
FORM ALONG AND N OF THE ADVANCING WARM FRONT. HAVE CONTD WITH 
HIGHEST POPS /MAINLY CHC CAT/ OVR THE NRN AND ERN PARTS OF THE FA 
TNGT AND INTO MON. WITH MOST OF THE STORMS EXPECTED TO BE 
ELEVATED...LARGE HAIL APPEARS TO BE THE PRIMARY SVR WX THREAT.

WARM AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL RMN IN PLACE ACRS AR THRU MIDWEEK. 
W-SWLY FLOW ALOFT WL KEEP AND SFC FNTS AWAY FROM THE AREA THRU THE 
PD. HOWEVER...WILL KEEP RAIN CHCS IN THE FCST THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS 
WEAK IMPULSES IN THE UPPER FLOW WILL BE ENOUGH TO TRIGGER A FEW 
SHOWERS OR STORMS.

HAVE USED A BLEND OF THE VARIOUS MODEL TEMP OUTPUT FOR MAX AND MIN 
TEMPS IN THE SHORT TERM.

ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN STILL APPEARS LIKELY DURING THE LONG TERM 
PERIODS. STRENGTHENING OF 500 MB RIDGE OVER THE SERN STATES/GULF 
COAST WILL ACT AS A BLOCK FOR FORWARD MOVING SURFACE SYSTEMS. STRONG 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL BRING UPPER LEVEL IMPULSES UP THROUGH 
THE FORECAST AREA FREQUENTLY. 

THE SURFACE AND UPPER SYSTEMS WILL INTERACT...AND WHEN COMBINED WITH 
DAYTIME HEATING THIS WILL INITIATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. CONVECTION LIKELY TO INITIATE DURING LATE 
MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON THEN DIE OFF OVERNIGHT. SCENARIO APPEARS 
POSSIBLE SEVERAL DAYS AS AREA DEALS WITH SEVERAL MESOSCALE AND 
SYNOPTIC SCALE BOUNDARIES LINGERING AROUND THE LOWER/MID MS VALLEY.

AS WAS MENTIONED YESTERDAY...IT IS ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO TIME 
INDIVIDUAL FEATURES AND BOUNDARIES THIS FAR OUT. HOWEVER...
INSTABILITY PARAMETERS...PRESENCE OF LIFTING MECHANISMS...AND AMPLE 
UPPER SUPPORT SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG THUNDERSTORMS...
PARTICULARLY DURING THE FRIDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT TIME FRAME AS COLD 
FRONT MOVES INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS. THAT BEING SAID...ONE THING THAT 
COULD LIMIT THIS POTENTIAL WOULD BE INHIBITION OF DAYTIME HEATING 
DUE TO CLOUD COVER. OF COURSE...THINGS COULD AND MAY CHANGE BETWEEN 
NOW AND THEN...BUT IT IS SOMETHING WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON. 

APPEARS THAT COLD FRONT WILL STALL SOMEWHERE INVOF CENTRAL/SRN 
ARKANSAS INTO WRN TENNESSEE/NRN MISSISSIPPI. NORTHWESTERN HALF OF 
THE AREA WILL SEE A BREAK IN THE ACTION SATURDAY/EARLY SUNDAY AS 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SCOOTS BY TO THE NORTH. BY SUNDAY...UPPER 
RIDGE APPEARS TO RETROGRADE A BIT...YUP...PUSHING THE FRONT BACK TO 
THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. 

AND I THOUGHT THIS WAS FALL...

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
FRONTAL SYSTEM JUST SOUTH OF THE BORDER WILL BE POISED TO MOVE BACK
NORTH AS A WARM FRONT LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT AS WEAK SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE SHIFTS TO THE EAST AND RETURN FLOW BEGINS OVER THE AREA. 
THE WARM ADVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATTERN MAY BE ENOUGH TO SET 
OFF SOME SHOWERS TODAY SO WILL PUT IN SMALL POPS MOSTLY IN THE SOUTH
THIS MORNING CLOSER TO THE WARM FRONT THEN SPREAD SMALL POPS OVER ALL
BUT THE NORTH BY LATE AFTERNOON. AS THE AIR DESTABILIZES THIS AFTERNOON
A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO MAY DEVELOP. WENT WITH ISOLATED WORDING IN THE
ZONES FOR TODAY AS COVERAGE SHOULD NOT BE VERY GREAT. A WEAK SHORT 
WAVE MOVES INTO THE AREA LATER TONIGHT AND THE WARM FRONT SHOULD 
BECOME MORE PRONOUNCED AS IT MOVES INTO NORTHERN AREAS AND THEN MOVES
INTO MISSOURI. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN AN INCREASING CHANCE OF RAIN
BUT THIS WILL BE REALIZED MORE IN THE NORTH CLOSER TO THE WARM 
FRONT. WENT UP TO 50 PERCENT IN THE NORTH FOR TONIGHT BUT KEPT POPS
AT 20 PERCENT IN THE SOUTHWEST. AVAILABLE INSTABILITY FROM DEW POINTS
INTO THE 60S AND RATHER STRONG JET DYNAMICS WILL POSE A THREAT FOR
SEVERE STORMS BUT THIS LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE GREATEST ALONG AND
A LITTLE NORTH OF THE WARM FRONT AND MAY ONLY AFFECT SOME NORTHERN 
COUNTIES IN THE CWA. STORMS MAY STILL BE ELEVATED IN NATURE WHICH 
SHOULD CUT DOWN ON SEVERE COVERAGE SO WILL NOT PLAY UP SEVERE IN
ZONES. ON MONDAY THE WARM FRONT SHOULD BE OUT OF THE CWA WITH 
WARM AND RATHER HUMID AIR FOR THIS LATE IN THE SEASON TAKING OVER. 
A WEAK DRY LINE MAY MOVE INTO THE AREA AND A WEAK SHORT WAVE MAY 
ACT TO SET OFF SOME THUNDERSTORMS. THERE WILL BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY
AND WIND DYNAMICS FOR A THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS BUT THE BEST CHANCE
OF THIS AGAIN APPEARS TO BE TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE AREA. WILL NOT 
MENTION SEVERE IN THE ZONES FOR MONDAY OR MONDAY NIGHT AT THIS 
TIME. RATHER STRONG GUSTY WINDS MAY DEVELOP IN RESPONSE TO A DEEP
SURFACE LOW TO THE NORTHWEST AND LAKE WIND ADVISORIES MAY BE 
REQUIRED. WARM HUMID AND UNSTABLE AIR WILL REMAIN IN PLACE 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. NO SIGNIFICANT FRONTS OR SHORT WAVES ARE 
INDICATED BUT WILL KEEP SOME MENTION OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
IN THE FORECAST AS ANY WEAK SHORT WAVE COMING OUT OF THE ZONAL TO
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WOULD BE ENOUGH TO SET OFF SOME ACTIVITY. 
MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY WILL DEPEND A LOT ON THE BEHAVIOR OF THE 
WARM FRONT AND THE WARM ADVECTION CLOUDS IN PACE. THE MOS 
PACKAGES DIVERGE ON MAX FORECASTS FOR TODAY AND WILL GO ABOUT
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE POSSIBILITIES. FROM TONIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...CONFIDENCE IS MUCH STRONGER THAT A WARM AND HUMID
AIR MASS WILL BE IN PLACE SO WILL GO WITH MINS MOSTLY IN THE
60S AND MAXES MOSTLY IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S.

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
LONG WAVE CROSSING THE ROCKIES STARTS OUT VERY IMPRESSIVE AT 00Z

LEFT TO PUSH A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE STATE AND TO BRING VERY DRY AIR 
BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE SURFACE LOW WILL BE MOVING AWAY FROM 
ARKANSAS AS IT GATHERS STRENGTH ON FRIDAY. THIS WILL MAKE THE 
SOUTHERN END OF THE COLD FRONT SLOW TO CLEAR THE STATE...SO MOISTURE 
WILL LINGER OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING. THE 
RIDGE MOVING IN FROM THE WEST WILL BE OF PACIFIC ORIGIN...AND IT 
WILL HAVE MODERATE EFFECTS ON OUR TEMPERATURES. IN FACT...LOWS AND

N WINDS CONT TO ALLOW DRIER AIRMASS TO SETTLE OVER THE FA THIS AFTN. 
DEWPOINTS IN THE 30S AND LOWER 40S COMMON ATTM. SFC WINDS EXPECTED 
TO DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET...ALLOWING FOR DECENT COOLING OVERNIGHT...
ESPECIALLY IN THE VALLEY AREAS OF NRN AND W-CNTRL AR.

THE COOL AND DRY WX OVER AR WILL BE SHORT-LIVED AS WE TRANSITION TO 
A SPRINGLIKE PATTERN IN THE COMING DAYS. ETA HAS CONTD TO SHOW GOOD 
RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IN THE SHORT TERM AND WL FOLLOW CLOSER TO 
IT/S SOLUTION. 

SFC HIGH WILL SHIFT EWD BY SUN...ALLOWING OLD SFC BNDRY TO BEGIN 
WORKING SLOLY NWD AS A WRMFNT. BNDRY EXPECTED INTO SRN AR BY MIDDAY 
SUN AND INTO CNTRL AR SUNDAY EVENING. COULD SEE A FEW SHRA/TSRA FORM 
ON SUN JUST N OF THE BNDRY WHERE WAA AND LIFT WL BE FOCUSED...MAINLY 
OVER SRN AR. HAVE BASED TEMP FCST FOR SUN AND SUN NIGHT ON THIS 
TIMING OF THE BNDRY. LOOKS LIKE SUN NIGHT LOWS MAY OCCUR EARLY IN 
THE EVENING DEPENDING ON LOCATION OF WRMFNT. S OF THE BNDRY...HAVE 
WORKED HOURLY GRIDS TO INDC STEADY TEMPS SUN NIGHT.

WRMFNT PROGGED TO BE OVER NERN AR MON MRNG AND CONT LIFTING SLOLY 
NWD DURG THE AFTN HRS. HAVE KEPT CHC POPS FOCUSED ALONG AND N OF THE 
BNDRY FOR MON...WITH SLGT CHC POPS ELSEWHERE.

FA IS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS BY MON NIGHT. 
EXPECT A GOOD BIT OF LOW CLOUDS...ESP DURG THE OVERNIGHT AND EARLY 
MRNG HRS MON AND TUE. SEVERAL WEAK IMPULSES ALOFT WILL ALSO AFFECT 
THE FA DURG THE LATTER HALF OF THE PD...SO HAVE LEFT SMALL RAIN CHCS 
IN THE FCST FOR MOST LOCATIONS.

HAVE GENERALLY GONE WITH A BLEND OF THE ETA AND GFS MOS TEMPS FOR 
MOST PDS. EXTENDED BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS WL LIKELY PLAY HAVOC WITH 
MAX TEMPS ON TUE.

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
MODEL SOLUTIONS INDICATE ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IN THE LONG TERM 
PERIODS. 500 MB RIDGE WILL CONTINUE BUILDING OVER THE EASTERN UNITED 
STATES...WITH TROUGH SETTING UP OVER THE SOUTHWEST. APPROACHING 
SURFACE FRONT WILL COME INTO PLAY BY WEDNESDAY...WITH PROGRESS 
HINDERED AND EVENTUALLY STOPPED BY THE RIDGE. 

WHAT THIS MEANS FOR ARKANSAS IS A SLOW MOVING/STALLED SURFACE 
BOUNDARY INVOF THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE STATE FOR SEVERAL DAYS. 
MODELS INDICATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT AS UPPER WAVES MOVE UP IN THE MEAN FLOW AND INTERACT 
WITH THE SYSTEM. ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY WANE DURING THE LATE 
NIGHT...AND REDEVELOP THE FOLLOWING AFTERNOON. THIS SCENARIO COULD 
CONTINUE INTO THE NEXT WEEKEND...WHEN POTENT UPPER TROUGH SWINGS 
DOWN IN STRENGTHENING NORTHWESTERLY FLOW AND PUSHES THE SURFACE 
SYSTEM EASTWARD. 

WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED PATTERN SETTING UP...AND CONSIDERING THE 
TIME OF YEAR...IT WOULD NOT SURPRISE ME IF WE SEE A STRONG STORM OR 
TWO DURING THE MIDDLE/END OF THE WORK WEEK. SURFACE BASED 
INSTABILITY WILL BE PRESENT...AND UPPER JET DYNAMICS WILL BE IN 
PLACE AS WELL. OF COURSE...THIS FAR OUT...THINGS ARE ALWAYS HARD TO 
PIN DOWN AS TIMING ISSUES COME INTO PLAY. HOWEVER...IT IS SOMETHING 
WE WILL KEEP AN EYE ON.

OKLAHOMA AND HEADING SOUTHWARD. FRONT AND ASSOCIATED UPPER LEVEL 
SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. WHILE MOISTURE IS

SUNDAY. ELEVATED CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG AND TO THE NORTH 
OF THE BOUNDARY ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT.

BY MONDAY...TROUGH DEVELOPING IN THE WEST AND RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER

COLD FRONT DEVELOPING IN THE PLAINS WILL SLOWLY DRIFT TOWARD THE

WARMER AIR WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE AREA THIS MORNING...WITH CLOUDS 
BREAKING UP OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF ARKANSAS. TEMPERATURES HAVE 
BEEN SLOW TO WARM...WITH ONLY MID 50S IN NORTHERN ARKANSAS TO NEAR

THIS AFTERNOON...WESTERLY FLOW WILL STRENGTHEN...AND TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD WARM UP TO FORECASTED HIGHS. 

SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS DECK OF AC MOVING DOWN THROUGH SOUTHEASTERN 
KANSAS AS UPPER WAVE AND APPROACHING COLD FRONT RIDE NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW DOWN TOWARD ARKANSAS. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE NORTHWEST 
HALF OF THE AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON...WITH CONDITIONS REMAINING 
MOSTLY SUNNY FOR THE SOUTHEAST.

400 AM CDT FRI OCT 15 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY
UNUSUALLY STRONG UPPER LOW FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR IS PULLING 
NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE AREA THIS MORNING BUT NOT MUCH HIGH
PRESSURE IS MOVING IN BEHIND IT. CLOUDS HAVE DECREASED BUT A COUPLE 
OF AREAS OF CLOUDS WILL ROTATE THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING. 
COULD SEE SOME STRATOCUMULUS THIS AFTERNOON SO WILL GO WITH PARTLY
CLOUDY WORDING. WESTERLY WINDS AND SUNSHINE SHOULD ALLOW FOR GOOD
WARMING TODAY AND MAXES IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S LOOK GOOD.
ANOTHER SHORT WAVE AND COLD FRONT MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT.
A GOOD AMOUNT OF MOISTURE ACCOMPNIES THIS SYSTEM AND PUT IN SMALL
POPS FOR LIGHT RAIN ACROSS THE AREA FOR TONIGHT. THIS SHOULD MOVE 
OUT EARLY SATURDAY AND CLOUDS SHOULD DECREASE. WENT A LITTLE LOWER 
WITH MAXES FOR SATURDAY. RETURN FLOW SETS UP AGAIN SUNDAY WITH A
MODEST INCREASE IN MOISTURE. THIS SHOULD INCREASE CLOUDS AND KEPT
SMALL POPS IN FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON...SPREADING ACROSS THE AREA 
SUNDAY NIGHT. A SHORT WAVE AND COLD FRONT APPROACH THE AREA MONDAY 
AND WENT UP TO CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY. AIR BECOMES QUITE UNSTABLE
MONDAY WITH RATHER STRONG FLOW ALOFT OVER THE AREA AND LOW SURFACE
PRESSURES. THIS COULD BE SET UP FOR SEVERE WEATHER BUT WILL JUST
GO WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR NOW. DID NOT MAKE SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES TO TEMP FORECAST SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY.   
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL PREVAIL THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN THE 
NEXT SHORT WAVE CROSSES THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES. THE LOW WILL BECOME 
WEAKER AS IT PUSHES TO THE NORTHEAST BY THURSDAY MORNING...LEAVING 
THE STATE BACK IN SOUTHWEST FLOW. THE SURFACE PATTERN KEEPS A 
SOMEWHAT MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW ACROSS ARKANSAS MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY. THEN...A LOW TAKES SHAPE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE UPPER 
SYSTEM AND IT OPENS THE GULF SIGNIFICANTLY BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. THE 
COLD FRONT ACCOMPANYING THE LOW WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE EAST OF THE 
STATE IN LIGHT OF THE WEAKENING UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT. I WILL PLACE 
CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST STARTING FROM THE SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY. MOST OF THE STATE WILL BE DRY BY THURSDAY MORNING. 
THE FRONT WILL BECOME STATIONARY JUST TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF OUR 
BORDERS...SETTING UP A QUICK RETURN OF CLOUDS AND RAIN BEYOND 
THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE BACK ABOVE NORMALS WITH THE SOUTHERLY 
WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
1100 AM CDT THU OCT 14 2004

.DISCUSSION...
12Z UPA ANALYSIS INDICATES UPPER LOW INVOF SERN KS. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY SHOWS CONTINUAL STREAM OF CLOUDS OVER THE EASTERN TWO THIRDS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHILE CLOUDS ARE SHOWING SOME BREAKS OVER THE 
WEST. 

COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE SYSTEM HAS BEEN STRONG THIS MORNING...WITH 
READINS IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS DROPPING AS MUCH AS EIGHT DEGREES IN 
THE LAST FIVE HOURS. THIS WILL LEVEL OFF A BIT BEFORE THE EARLY 
AFTERNOON...AND TEMPS MAY ACTUALLY RISE A DEGREE OR TWO BEFORE 
FALLING AGAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON. READINGS IN THE CENTRAL HAVE 
BEEN NEARLY STEADY FOR THE LAST FEW HOURS...AND THE SOUTHEASTERN 
AREAS HAVE SHOWN ONLY A SLIGHT RISE.

SO...THAT BEING SAID...THIS BRINGS ME TO UPDATES FOR THE CURRENT 
FORECAST. CLOUD COVER AND ADVECTION BEHIND THE SYSTEM HAVE MADE 
TEMPERATURE TRENDS EXTREMELY DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN. IT APPEARS THAT 
NORTHWEST ARKANSAS WILL SEE VERY LITTLE CHANGE THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON...WITH READINGS LIKELY FALLING A FEW DEGREES IN NORTHEAST 
ARKANSAS AS COLD FRONT CONTINUES MOVING EASTWARD TOWARD THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. CENTRAL ARKANSAS WILL SEE READINGS RISE A LITTLE 
BIT OR HOLD STEADY...BEFORE FALLING DURING THE AFTERNOON. SOUTHEAST 
ARKANSAS SHOULD SEE THE MOST DIURNAL SWING /IF YOU WANT TO CALL IT 
THAT/...WITH READINGS TOPPING OUT NEAR 60. 

NEXT ISSUE IS WINDS. SUSTAINED WINDS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW LAKE WIND 
CRITERIA THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THEY HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE 
BEHIND THE COLD FRONT AND AS THE UPPER LOW APPROACHES. WILL KEEP 
SUSTAINED WINDS AT 10 TO 15...BUT WILL MENTION GUSTS AS HIGH AS 30 
MPH. 

FINALLY...HAVE UPDATED POP TRENDS...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS IN 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS AS UPPER LOW SWINGS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON. WHILE 
THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL PATCHY LIGHT RAIN DEVELOPING 
THIS AFTERNOON...DECIDED TO TAKE ISOLATED THUNDER OUT OF THE 
FORECAST DUE TO LACK OF INSTABILITY AND A SLIGHT CAP IN THE MID 
LEVELS. 

UPDATED TEXT FORECASTS HAVE BEEN SENT. GRAPHICAL AND GRIDDED DATA 
HAS BEEN POSTED. TABULAR PRODUCT UPDATES ARE FORTHCOMING. AND...DUE 
TO TRICKINESS OF THIS FORECAST...MORE UPDATES MAY FOLLOW LATER 
TODAY.

400 AM CDT THU OCT 14 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
UPPER LOW WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO ARKANSAS TODAY...AND DISTURBANCES 
ROTATING AROUND THIS LOW WILL BRING CLOUDY AND RAINY CONDITIONS TO 
THE AREA. LIGHT RAINFALL ALREADY REPORTED IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS... 
AND WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST THIS MORNING. AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT...WITH 
LESS THAN 1/4 INCH EXPECTED. HIGHEST CHANCES WILL BE IN THE NORTH 
...CLOSER TO THE UPPER LOW. THUNDER ALSO POSSIBLE...BUT WILL BE 
ISOLATED AT BEST. GUSTY WINDS ALSO TODAY...DUE TO PRESSURE GRADIENT 
BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE IN WEST TEXAS AND LOW JUST TO THE EAST OF 
ARKANSAS.

1100 AM CDT WED OCT 13 2004

MADE MINOR CHANGES TO THE FORECAST. UPDATE IS OUT ALREADY.
THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS...

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN ILLINOIS WILL MOVE EAST TODAY. LOW 
CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY BREAK UP OVER THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE AREA 
AS THE LOW CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST...WHILE IN THE SOUTHWEST... 
CLEARING HAS ALREADY OCCURRED. TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE 5 TO 10 
DEGREES WARMER THAN TUESDAY ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA...DUE TO LACK OF 
CLOUDS AND PRECIP.

CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT FROM THE NORTHWEST...AHEAD OF A STRONG 
COLD FRONT AND ANOTHER UPPER LOW. MODELS CONSISTENT WITH TIMING... 
BUT NOT WITH MOISTURE AND POPS. FOR NOW...CONTINUED THE TREND OF 
HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS...BUT AMOUNTS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS 
THAN THE LAST EVENT. MOST AREAS WILL PROBABLY SEE LESS THAN 1/2 INCH.

BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONTAL PASSAGE THURSDAY 
AND CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY EVENING. WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS AROUND AS 
UPPER LOW OVERHEAD THURSDAY...TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOL. READINGS 
WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH MID 50S AND LOWER 60S. NORMALS FOR THIS TIME 
OF YEAR ARE IN THE 70S.

CLOUDS WILL DECREASE THURSDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING TEMPS TO FALL INTO 
THE 40S. SOME LINGERING SHOWERS IN THE EAST THURSDAY EVENING...BUT 
AS UPPER LOW HEADS EAST...PRECIP AND CLOUDS DIMINISH.

PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL BRING WARMING TEMPS 
FRIDAY...SO COOL DOWN WILL BE SHORT LIVED.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
PATTERN WILL REMAIN FAIRLY ACTIVE HEADING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
FRONT WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY FRONT 
FRIDAY NIGHT/EARLY SATURDAY. NOT MUCH MOISTURE WITH FRONT...SO NO 
PRECIPITATION MENTIONED WITH PASSAGE. THE SECONDARY FRONT WILL CURB 
WARMING TREND HEADING INTO WEEKEND. 

AFOREMENTIONED WARMING TREND WILL REALLY GET GOING SUNDAY/MONDAY AS 
NEXT STORM SYSTEM RIDES SUBTROPICAL JET THROUGH SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES/SOUTHERN PLAINS. AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM...NOT ONLY WILL 
TEMPERATURES GO UP WITH SOUTHERLY WIND...MOISTURE WILL ALSO INCREASE 
AS WELL.

TIMING WITH SYSTEM A LITTLE UNCERTAIN...BUT HAVE IT SCHEDULED TO 
ARRIVE LATE MONDAY/EARLY TUESDAY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. SYSTEM OUT OF PHASE WITH NORTHERN STREAM...SO WILL BE 
FOLLOWED BY PACIFIC AIR AND ONLY A MINIMAL COOLDOWN. (46)

355 AM CDT WED OCT 13 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN ILLINOIS WILL MOVE EAST TODAY. LOW 
CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY BREAK UP OVER THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE AREA 
AS THE LOW CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST...WHILE IN THE SOUTHWEST... 
CLEARING HAS ALREADY OCCURRED. TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE 5 TO 10 
DEGREES WARMER THAN TUESDAY ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA...DUE TO LACK OF 
CLOUDS AND PRECIP.

CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT FROM THE NORTHWEST...AHEAD OF A STRONG 
COLD FRONT AND ANOTHER UPPER LOW. MODELS CONSISTENT WITH TIMING... 
BUT NOT WITH MOISTURE AND POPS. FOR NOW...CONTINUED THE TREND OF 
HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS...BUT AMOUNTS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY LESS 
THAN THE LAST EVENT. MOST AREAS WILL PROBABLY SEE LESS THAN 1/2 INCH.

BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONTAL PASSAGE THURSDAY 
AND CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY EVENING. WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS AROUND AS 
UPPER LOW OVERHEAD THURSDAY...TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOL. READINGS 
WILL STRUGGLE TO REACH MID 50S AND LOWER 60S. NORMALS FOR THIS TIME 
OF YEAR ARE IN THE 70S.

CLOUDS WILL DECREASE THURSDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING TEMPS TO FALL INTO 
THE 40S. SOME LINGERING SHOWERS IN THE EAST THURSDAY EVENING...BUT 
AS UPPER LOW HEADS EAST...PRECIP AND CLOUDS DIMINISH.

PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL BRING WARMING TEMPS 
FRIDAY...SO COOL DOWN WILL BE SHORT LIVED.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
PATTERN WILL REMAIN FAIRLY ACTIVE HEADING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
FRONT WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY WILL BE FOLLOWED BY SECONDARY FRONT 
FRIDAY NIGHT/EARLY SATURDAY. NOT MUCH MOISTURE WITH FRONT...SO NO 
PRECIPITATION MENTIONED WITH PASSAGE. THE SECONDARY FRONT WILL CURB 
WARMING TREND HEADING INTO WEEKEND. 

AFOREMENTIONED WARMING TREND WILL REALLY GET GOING SUNDAY/MONDAY AS 
NEXT STORM SYSTEM RIDES SUBTROPICAL JET THROUGH SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES/SOUTHERN PLAINS. AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM...NOT ONLY WILL 
TEMPERATURES GO UP WITH SOUTHERLY WIND...MOISTURE WILL ALSO INCREASE 
AS WELL.

TIMING WITH SYSTEM A LITTLE UNCERTAIN...BUT HAVE IT SCHEDULED TO 
ARRIVE LATE MONDAY/EARLY TUESDAY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. SYSTEM OUT OF PHASE WITH NORTHERN STREAM...SO WILL BE 
FOLLOWED BY PACIFIC AIR AND ONLY A MINIMAL COOLDOWN. (46)

KLZK RADAR IS DRY THIS EVENING. SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW THE BACK EDGE 
OF THE CLOUDS ACROSS SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS. THIS CLEARING LINE WILL 
WORK SLOWLY NORTHEAST. SEVERAL CHANGES WERE NEEDED IN THIS UPDATE. 
ADJUSTED CLOUD GRIDS TO BETTER MATCH CURRENT CONDITIONS. WITH THE 
CLEARING SKIES IN THE SOUTHWEST...LOWERED TEMPERATURES THERE. 
ALSO...WITH NO RAIN AROUND THE AREA...LOWERED POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE 
IN THE NORTH AND REMOVED THUNDER. CROSS SECTIONS DO NOT REVEAL MUCH 
IN THE WAY OF UPWARD MOTION OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS...HOWEVER 
THURSDAY MORNING IS A DIFFERENT STORY AS THE NEXT COLD FRONT COMES

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
PERSISTENT LOW OVER MISSOURI WILL MOVE EAST OUT OF OUR PICTURE 
OVERNIGHT. THIS WILL WORK ON LOW CLOUDS SO WILL KEEP LOW POPS ACROSS 
THE NORTH TONIGHT. THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL BE UPON US RATHER QUICKLY 
DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WEDNESDAY INTO EARLY THURSDAY. MOISTURE 
NEVER QUITE GETS OUT OF OUR AREA...SO STRONG LIFTING WITH THAT 
SYSTEM WILL TRIGGER GOOD CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY. SPEED OF THE SYSTEM WILL TAKE IT EAST OF THE STATE FRIDAY 
NIGHT...WARRANTING SMALL POPS FRIDAY NIGHT EARLY. DRY FORECAST 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. THE SURFACE REFLECTION OF 
THESE FAST MOVING SYSTEMS WILL HAVE STRONG WINDS TO GO ALONG WITH 
THEM...IN THE 15 TO 25 MPH RANGE FOR NOW WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 10 TO 
20 ON THURSDAY. WINDS WILL SHIFT GRADUALLY TO THE WEST ON FRIDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL MAKE A NOTICEABLE SHIFT TOWARDS THE COLDER SIDE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. HIGHS THURSDAY WILL 
RISE VERY LITTLE FROM THE MORNING LOWS...AND IT WILL FEEL SOMEWHAT 
RAW WHEN COMBINED WITH THE WINDS.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE IN GENERALLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
USUAL TIMING AND INTENSITY DIFFERENCES ONE WOULD EXPECT. GFS HAS 
BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT MODEL OF LATE BUT SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE 
FASTER THAN THE REMAINDER OF THE MODELS. WILL SIMPLY SPLIT THE 
DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS AND GO WITH A COMPROMISE OF SOLUTIONS 
THIS AFTERNOON.

OVERALL PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
RIDGING OVER THE PAC NORTHWEST WILL FLATTEN OUT AS MID LEVEL TROF 
KICKS OUT OF THE ROCKIES EARLY IN THE PERIOD. SURFACE HIGH OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST WILL HOLD LONG ENOUGH TO KEEP THE AREA DRY ON SUNDAY BUT 
PUSHES OFF SHORE BY MONDAY MORNING. SURFACE LOW MOVES ACROSS THE 
UPPER MIDWEST SUNDAY NIGHT AND PUSHES A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. CURRENT FORECAST DRY SO POPS WILL NEED TO 
BE INTRODUCED AS MOISTURE MAY BE AVAILABLE. WILL GO WITH JUST MIDDLE 
OF THE ROAD SCATTERED POPS FOR NOW AS SYSTEM DEVELOPS. GFS IS NOW 
HINTING AT SECONDARY LOW FORMATION ON THE FRONT MONDAY MORNING BUT 
WILL TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH. SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH LATE MONDAY 
WITH WEAK RIDGING RETURNING FOR TUESDAY IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT 
SYSTEM DIGGING INTO THE PLAINS.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...OVERALL FLOW ALOFT IS WESTERLY THROUGH OUT 
THE PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL AVERAGE NEAR MID OCTOBER NORMS THROUGH 
THE PERIOD. MEX NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE AND ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
DATA STILL COMING IN LATER THAN USUAL DUE TO SOME COMPUTER CONCERNS 
BUT ALL INDICATIONS ARE THAT THE UNSETTLED PATTERN WILL CONTINUE FOR 
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. COMPARING THE CURRENT POSITIONING OF THE 
FEATURES BASED OFF THE OLDER RUNS...THE GFS SEEMS TO HAVE A REAL 
GOOD HANDLE ON THE OVERALL SITUATION. GFS MODEL ALSO THE MOST 
CONSISTENT OF LATE WITH ETA SEEMINGLY PLAYING CATCH UP ALL THE TIME. 
THAT BEING SAID...WILL LEAN IN THE DIRECTION OF THE GFS THIS 
AFTERNOON.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES THE CENTER OF WHAT WAS ONCE MATTHEW 
ALONG THE STONE COUNTY/CLEBURNE COUNTY BORDER. SYSTEM CONTINUES 
TO FILL AND WEAKEN AS IT DRIFTS OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. WATER VAPOR  
IMAGERY SHOWS AIR MASS DRYING OUT CONSIDERABLY BUT LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE WILL REMAIN PLENTIFUL. WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION HAS MOVED 
WELL OFF TO THE NORTHEAST BUT SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE STILL POSSIBLE 
THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH SEVERAL WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES 
RIPPLING THROUGH THE MEAN FLOW. 

NEXT CONCERN WILL BE LOW PRESSURE ALOFT. WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS 
THIS FEATURE CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL OKLAHOMA. UPPER LOW PROGGED TO 
SLOWLY CROSS THE STATE LATE TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. LOW IS PROGGED 
TO STRADDLE THE ARKANSAS/MISSOURI BORDER SO CHANCES FOR ADDITIONAL 
RAIN WILL MAINLY BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE 
STATE WHERE BEST DYNAMICS LAY. PRECIPITATION WILL BE MORE SCATTERED 
IN NATURE THAN WHAT HAS OCCURRED OVER THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS WHERE 
SOME ARAES SAW NEARLY 8 INCHES OF RAIN.  LOTS OF CLOUDS IN FORECAST 
AND WITH NORTHEAST WIND AND SOME PRECIPITATION IN THE FORECAST... 
TUESDAY PROMISES TO BE COOL WITH READINGS WELL BELOW NORMAL.

ONCE UPPER LOW PASSES...STRONG COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE 
WEST. THERE MAY BE A BRIEF PERIOD OF CLEARING WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
BETWEEN SYSTEMS BUT ANY SUNSHINE WILL BE SHORT LIVED. SCATTERED 
SHOWERS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT AS IT MOVES THROUGH VERY QUICKLY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DEEP TROF AXIS WITH AN UPPER LEVEL LOW IN ITS BASE 
SWINGS THROUGH NORTHERN THURSDAY MORNING SO SCATTERED POPS ONCE 
AGAIN ARE SUPPORTED. MODELS INDICATING STRONG RIDGING OFF THE WEST 
COAST AS THE NEARLY FULL LATITUDE TROF MOVES INTO THE EASTERN CONUS 
BY FRIDAY MORNING. GUSTY NORTH TO NORTHWEST WINDS WILL DEVELOP 
BEHIND THE FRONT WITH A CONSIDERABLY COOLER AIR MASS MOVING IN. 
SECONDARY COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA LATE FRIDAY AND 
FRIDAY NIGHT BUT APPEARS TO BE DRY. IT WILL ACT TO REINFORCE THE 
COOL AIR OVER THE REGION. FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF 
MAV/FWC NUMBERS. TEMPERATURES WILL AVERAGE BELOW NORMAL THROUGH OUT 
THE PERIOD.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY
THIS TERM WILL BEGIN WITH NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND IT WILL 
TRANSITION TO WESTERLY FLOW BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. NO SIGNIFICANT 
SHORT WAVES WILL INTERACT WITH OUR SURFACE PATTERN AFTER THE LONG 
WAVE TROF MOVES ACROSS THE STATE THURSDAY. A DEEP SURFACE LOW WILL 
BE DROPPING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN ROCKIES FROM CANADA 
SATURDAY. THEN...ON SUNDAY...THE LOW WILL BRING STRONG FLOW ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS AND THE MID SOUTH. A SURFACE HIGH 
OVER THE NORTHERN ROCKIES WILL SLIDE SOUTHEAST PUSHING A SHOT OF 
REINFORCING COOL AND DRY AIR FOR MONDAY. CURRENT GRIDS ON TRACK SO 
CHANGES WERE MINIMAL.

AREA OF RAIN THAT HAS RESIDED IN ABOUT THE SOUTHERN ONE HALF OF
THE CWA THROUGH THE EVENING IS SHOWING SIGNS OF SPREADING SLOWLY
TO THE NORTH. RAIN SHOULD COVER CENTRAL SECTIONS BY MIDNIGHT BUT
ARRIVAL INTO NORTHERN SECTIONS MAY NOT COME UNTIL VERY LATE TONIGHT 
OR SUNDAY MORNING. DUE TO THIS...LOWERED POPS TO CHANCE IN THE 
NORTH FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT AND LOWERED QPF TO ONLY A FEW
HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH. OTHERWISE KEPT OTHER POPS ABOUT THE SAME
INDICATING AN INCREASE ACROSS CENTRAL SECTIONS AS THE NIGHT GOES ON. 
WENT WITH 90 PERCENT POPS IN THE SOUTH AND INCREASED QPF A LITTLE 
TO UP TO 1/2 INCH. REST OF FORECAST FOR TONIGHT LOOKS ON TRACK.
TROPICAL STORM MATTHEW MAY BE MOVING A LITTLE FARTHER EAST THAN 
THOUGHT EARLIER. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH TROPICAL
MOISTURE AND ASSOCIATED HEAVY RAINFALL WILL AFFECT THE CWA BUT

TROPICAL STORM MATTHEW IN GULF OF MEXICO WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD 
MOISTURE INTO ARKANSAS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND. COLD FRONT 
TO NORTHWEST WILL HEAD INTO THE STATE TODAY BEFORE STALLING 
TONIGHT/SUNDAY. AROUND FRONT...COOL NORTHEAST WIND WILL BE NOTED 
WITH OVERCAST SKY/WIDESPREAD RAIN. 

DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS...WITH ONLY A FEW DEGREES SEPARATING DAYTIME AND NIGHTTIME 
READINGS. 

PRECIPITATION TRENDS FOR TODAY WILL SHOW RAIN MAINLY CONFINED TO 
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. AS MICHAEL HEADS TOWARD THE CENTRAL GULF 
COAST...RAIN WILL SPREAD FARTHER NORTH TONIGHT/SUNDAY WITH AREAS OF 
FOG DEVELOPING.

WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION WILL BEGIN SHIFTING TO THE NORTH ON 
COLUMBUS DAY...BUT RAIN CHANCES WILL REMAIN HIGH OVER NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE STATE. AGAIN...DAYTIME TEMPERATURES HELD DOWN BY 
CLOUDS/RAIN. 

CLOUDS/PRECIPITATION PRETTY MUCH OVER HEADING INTO MIDWEEK WITH 
WARMER DAYTIME TEMPERATURES. HOWEVER...THIS WILL BE SQUELCHED 
THURSDAY/FRIDAY AS A SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT ARRIVES FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. LOW CHANCES OF RAIN WITH FRONT...BUT LIKELY THE COOLEST 
AIR OF THE YOUNG FALL SEASON BEHIND THE FRONT. (46)

LOTS OF MOISTURE PRETTY MUCH STUCK OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL UNITED
STATES. MOISTURE BETWEEN DEEPENING TROUGH IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS
AND FAIRLY STRONG HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH AND EAST. SLOW MOVING
STORM SYSTEM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO WITH GOOD CHANCES FOR RAIN
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

RAIN COULD BE SIGNIFICANT...WITH ALREADY TWO TO THREE INCHES OF
PRECIPITATION OVERNIGHT IN PORTIONS OF WESTERN ARKANSAS. LARGE
PRECIPITATION SHIELD COVERING WESTERN HALF OF STATE EARLY
THIS MORNING...WITH THE RAIN EXPECTED TO PUSH SLOWLY EASTWARD
TODAY.

WITH LOTS OF CLOUDS AND RAIN...LOWERED AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES QUITE
A BIT...ESPECIALLY FROM LITTLE ROCK WESTWARD.

MOISTURE WILL GET SHUNTED TO THE SOUTH A BIT TONIGHT/SATURDAY AS
HIGH PRESSURE STRENGHENS NORTH OF THE REGION. LOWERED CHANCES OF
RAIN NORTH/CENTRAL ARKANSAS...WITH SHOWERS/A FEW THUNDERSTORMS
REMAINING LIKELY IN SOUTHERN ARKANSAS.

HIGH WILL MOVE TO THE EAST A BIT ON SUNDAY...ALLOWING MOISTURE TO
SURGE NORTH ONCE AGAIN. RAIN CHANCES ON THE WAY UP...AND WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED TO SEE ANOTHER ROUND OF HEAVY PRECIPITATION.

THROUGH THE WEEKEND...KEPT HIGH TEMPERATURES PRETTY MUCH IN THE
UPPER 60S/LOWER 70S. READINGS WILL NOT DROP MUCH AT NIGHT...WITH
MID 50S/LOWER 60S IN THE FORECAST.

LOOKING AHEAD...LOW PRESSURE IN THE GULF WILL LIFT TO THE

WARMUP WILL OCCUR BEFORE A COLD FRONT FOLLOWS FROM CANADA BY
WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY. COOLER CONDITIONS BEHIND FRONT TO END

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...
BOTH THE GFS AND ETA SOLUTIONS ARE TENDING STRONGER WITH THE TROF 
LIFTING OUT OF THE FOUR CORNERS OVER THE NEXT DAY OR SO BUT ARE ALSO 
SHUNTING IT OFF FURTHER NORTH THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. OTHER CHANGES DEAL 
WITH THE DEVELOPING LOW IN THE GULF OF MEXICO. ETA SEEMS TO BE OUT 
ON ITS OWN WITH ITS SOLUTION OF BRINGING IT ON SHORE. GFS KEEP THE 
SYSTEM OFF SHORE WITH THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE TROUGH CONSIDERABLY 
FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE ETA. GFS SOLUTION BACKED UP BY OTHER SHORT 
TERM MODELS AND CONTINUES TO BE MORE CONSISTENT OVERALL. I HATE TO 
DISCOUNT THE ETA ENTIRELY AS IT LOOKS LIKE THE GFS DID A DAY OR SO 
AGO. THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS. 

LATEST ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO SHOW STRONG RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
CONUS AND A STRONG SURFACE HIGH CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC. 
RETURN FLOW HAS RETURNED WITH DEW POINT TEMPERATURES SURGING INTO 
THE LOWER 60S OVER THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE STATE. DRY AIR THAT 
WAS IN PLACE STATE WIDE HAS BEEN PUSHED OFF TO THE NORTHEAST AND 
EXPECT MOISTURE TO INCREASE HERE AS WELL...JUST A LITTLE SLOWER WITH 
THE PROXIMITY OF THE HIGH PRESSURE. 

LOW LEVEL WWA FORECAST TO INCREASE DURING THE DAY TODAY AS TROUGH 
STARTS TO LIFT OUT. FAVORABLE JET DYNAMICS ALSO COME INTO PLAY AND 
EXPECT PRECIPITATION TO STEADILY INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE 
LATE AFTERNOON. DYNAMICS REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS 
AS THE TROF CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST/NORTHEAST. WILL NOT GO AS FAST 
WITH THE INITIATION OF PRECIPITATION ADVERTISED BY THE MODELS AS AIR 
MASS WILL STILL NEED SOME TIME TO MOISTEN UP. WILL HAVE HIGH 
SCATTERED TO LIKELY POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA BY THE END OF THE DAY 
AS PATTERN EVOLVES. WILL CONTINUE HIGH SCATTERED/LIKELY POPS THROUGH 
THE OVERNIGHT HOURS ACROSS THE REGION AS GUIDANCE COMING BACK WITH 
POPS IN THE 80 PERCENT AND ABOVE RANGE AND I REALLY HAVE NO REASON 
TO ARGUE.

ANOTHER FACTOR TO CONSIDER IS THE DEVELOPING SYSTEM IN THE GULF. 
WHILE GFS IS NOT AS AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS FEATURE AS THE ETA...PWAT 
VALUES ARE AT OR ABOVE 1.5 INCHES THROUGH OUT THE DAY. SURFACE WAVE 
WILL BE SITTING IN THE WESTERN GULF FRIDAY MORNING WITH GFS BRINGING 
INVERTED TROF AS FAR NORTH AS THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE STATE. ETA 
BRINGS THE INVERTED TROF INTO CENTRAL MISSOURI AND THE LOW MUCH 
FURTHER NORTH. THIS WOULD SUPPORT MUCH HEAVIER PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS 
THAN THE GFS. 

REGARDLESS...HIGH POPS WILL NEED TO BE CONTINUED ON FRIDAY AS DEEP 
MOISTURE WILL REMAIN AND JET DYNAMICS REMAIN FAVORABLE FOR 
OVERRUNNING PRECIP. RAIN WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE OUT FRIDAY AS TROF 
RUNS INTO THE HIGH STRETCHED OUT ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD. WILL 
TAPER POPS OFF FRIDAY NIGHT AS ENTIRE SYSTEM LIFTS OUT. SYSTEM OUT 
OF THE AREA BY SATURDAY WITH ANOTHER HIGH MOVING INTO THE UPPER 
MIDWEST AND SOME RIDGING ALOFT. SURFACE FLOW TURNS TO THE NORTHEAST 
ON SATURDAY AND CHANCE POPS SHOULD SUFFICE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 
RESIDUAL MOISTURE AND THE SLOW MOVING WAVE STILL IN THE GULF. SAME 
SITUATION HOLD FOR SUNDAY AND WILL LOWER POPS TO CHANCE FOR THIS DAY.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...WITH INCREASING MOISTURE...CLOUDS AND POPS 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE TRICKY TODAY. STILL SHOULD BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE 
OUT ONE MORE DAY OF 80 IN THE METRO AND SOUTH BEFORE PRECIP STATES. 
TEMPS WILL BE IN THE 70S THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. WILL GO WITH A 
BLEND OF FWC/MAV NUMBERS.
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
CUT OFF LOW OVER THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL FILL SLOWLY 
AS IT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL AMPLIFY A WEAK RIDGE OVER 
THE STATE TO BRING A BRIEF BREAK IN THE RAINFALL FOR TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND TUESDAY NIGHT. THEN...THE LONG WAVE TROF WILL PHASE IN 
WITH THE LOW AND IT WILL PUNCH TO THE EAST AS THE SYSTEM TRANSLATES 
EAST. THE SURFACE PATTERN WILL CONTINUE WET AS A SLUG OF MOISTURE 
MOVES ACROSS ARKANSAS ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE RETREATING SURFACE 
HIGH. TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT WILL TAKE A BREAK FROM THE 
RAIN...THEN THE NEXT COLD FRONT WILL ROLL TO THE EAST UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE PHASING TROF ALOFT ON WEDNESDAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE IN THE 70S FOR MONDAY...AND THEY WILL WARM TUESDAY WITH THE 
BREAK IN THE RAIN. IT WILL BE EVEN WARMER FOR WEDNESDAY WITH 
SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE NEXT FRONT.
&&
&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
THOUGH FINE FUELS REMAIN CRITICALLY DRY...MOISTURE HAS BEGUN TO 
INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA AS WINDS CONTINUE TO SHIFT TO MORE OF A 
SOUTHERLY DIRECTION. DEW POINT TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO STEADILY 
RISE WITH WETTING RAIN LIKELY OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
DISTRICTS OVER THE NEXT THREE DAYS. THIS WILL ALLEVIATE THE DRY 
CONDITIONS IN THE SHORT TERM BUT RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL LIKELY NOT BE 
ENOUGH TO HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT IN THE BIGGER SCHEME OF THINGS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
256 AM CDT WED OCT  6 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
ETA SHOWING CONSIDERABLE CHANGES THIS MORNING VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS. 
ETA HAS TRENDED SLIGHTLY FASTER BUT CONSIDERABLY STRONGER WITH THE 
TROF OVER THE FOUR CORNERS REGION. EXCEPT FOR THE SLIGHT TIMING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE TROF AS IT KICKS INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...THE 
MODELS ARE NOW IN GOOD AGREEMENT. THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A 
BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS MORNING WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE 
MORE CONSISTENT GFS.

HIGH PRESSURE TO REMAIN IN CONTROL ONE MORE DAY BEFORE OVERALL 
PATTERN EVOLVES INTO A WETTER ONE. STRONG SURFACE HIGH STRETCHES 
FROM NORTHEAST ARKANSAS TO SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND ONLY MOVES 
SLIGHTLY EASTWARD DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY. DEW POINT 
TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM THE LOW 30S TO LOW 40S ACROSS THE STATE AS 
EAST TO NORTHEAST WINDS CONTINUE TO ADVECT IN DRY AIR. DEEPER 
MOISTURE ALREADY POOLING OFF TO WEST ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS. 
LARGE MCS OVER WESTERN TEXAS WILL LIKELY THROW SOME HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS OVER US LATER BUT OVERALL BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY SHOULD 
SUFFICE FOR TODAY.

HIGH BEGINS TO SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH RETURN 
FLOW SETTING UP. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY BUT 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE HELD OFF EXCEPT OVER THE FAR WEST 
WHERE DEEPEST MOISTURE REMAINS. CONFIDENCE IN PRECIPITATION EVEN 
OVER THE WEST NOT VERY HIGH ON THURSDAY. AIR MASS IS SO DRY 
INITIALLY THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME TO MOISTEN IT UP ENOUGH TO SUPPORT 
PRECIPITATION.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY WILL BE SHUNTED EAST 
ON THURSDAY AS TROF OVER THE FOUR CORNERS STARTS TO LIFT OUT. 
SEVERAL WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
WILL JUSTIFY AT LEAST CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY. BEST SUPPORT FOR 
SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION REMAINS OVER OKLAHOMA AND THEN CURVES INTO 
SOUTHWEST MISSOURI SO HIGHER POPS IN THESE AREAS WILL BE NEEDED BUT 
QPF STILL WILL BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE.

WHILE ALL THIS IS GOING ON...THINGS START TO GET INTERESTING IN THE 
WESTERN GULF. MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH DEVELOPING A WAVE 
JUST OFF OF BROWNSVILLE TEXAS AND CARRYING IT NORTHEAST ALONG THE 
GULF COAST. SYSTEM TAPS INTO TROPICAL MOISTURE WITH PWATS IN EXCESS 
OF 1.5 INCHES OVER MOST OF THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE CWA BY 
SATURDAY MORNING. MODELS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH TWO DISTINCT 
SHORTWAVES MOVING THROUGH THE AREA IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AS 
TROF GETS BOGGED DOWN RUNNING INTO THE SURFACE HIGH SITTING OVER THE 
CAROLINAS.

SYSTEM IN THE GULF COMES ON SHORE OVER CENTRAL LOUISIANA LATE 
SATURDAY. LARGE PLUME OF MOISTURE SWINGS THROUGH THE CWA SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON BEFORE MOVING NORTH BY SUNDAY MORNING. SLIVER OF DRY AIR 
OVER THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE EARLY SATURDAY QUICKLY PUSHED OFF 
TO THE NORTH. LOW SCATTERED POPS EARLY SATURDAY WILL HAVE TO BE 
BOOSTED TO HIGH SCATTERED BY LATE SATURDAY. MEX GUIDANCE COMING IN 
WITH 70 POPS BUT WITH SO MUCH DRY AIR IN PLACE INITIALLY...WONT GO 
ABOVE HIGH SCATTERED AT THIS POINT.  

ANOTHER CONCERN IS THUNDER. UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT ONLY JUSTIFIES 
ISOLATED THUNDER MOST OF THE PERIOD. WILL REWORK THE PRECIP GRIDS TO 
GO WITH ISOLATED THUNDER. EVENT ON SATURDAY ACTUALLY LOOKS TO BE 
MORE STRATIFORM IN NATURE SO WILL GO MORE THAT WAY. AS FAR AS 
TEMPERATURES GO...FWC NUMBERS ARE INITIALLY COOLER AND ACTUALLY FIT 
IN BETTER WITH CURRENT CONDITIONS AS OPPOSED TO THE MAV. WILL LEAN 
MORE TOWARDS THE FWC NUMBERS EARLY BEFORE GOING WITH A BLEND OF 
MAV/FWC NUMBERS LATER IN THE PERIOD.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
WEAK SHORT WAVE ALOFT WILL LINGER JUST TO THE NORTHWEST OF ARKANSAS 
DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS...THEN IT WILL FILL AND GET OUT OF OUR

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
256 AM CDT WED OCT  6 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
ETA SHOWING CONSIDERABLE CHANGES THIS MORNING VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS. 
ETA HAS TRENDED SLIGHTLY FASTER BUT CONSIDERABLY STRONGER WITH THE 
TROF OVER THE FOUR CORNERS REGION. EXCEPT FOR THE SLIGHT TIMING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE TROF AS IT KICKS INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS...THE 
MODELS ARE NOW IN GOOD AGREEMENT. THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A 
BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS MORNING WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE 
MORE CONSISTENT GFS.

HIGH PRESSURE TO REMAIN IN CONTROL ONE MORE DAY BEFORE OVERALL 
PATTERN EVOLVES INTO A WETTER ONE. STRONG SURFACE HIGH STRETCHES 
FROM NORTHEAST ARKANSAS TO SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND AND ONLY MOVES 
SLIGHTLY EASTWARD DURING THE COURSE OF THE DAY. DEW POINT 
TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM THE LOW 30S TO LOW 40S ACROSS THE STATE AS 
EAST TO NORTHEAST WINDS CONTINUE TO ADVECT IN DRY AIR. DEEPER 
MOISTURE ALREADY POOLING OFF TO WEST ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS. 
LARGE MCS OVER WESTERN TEXAS WILL LIKELY THROW SOME HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS OVER US LATER BUT OVERALL BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY SHOULD 
SUFFICE FOR TODAY.

HIGH BEGINS TO SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH RETURN 
FLOW SETTING UP. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY BUT 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE HELD OFF EXCEPT OVER THE FAR WEST 
WHERE DEEPEST MOISTURE REMAINS. CONFIDENCE IN PRECIPITATION EVEN 
OVER THE WEST NOT VERY HIGH ON THURSDAY. AIR MASS IS SO DRY 
INITIALLY THAT IT WILL TAKE TIME TO MOISTEN IT UP ENOUGH TO SUPPORT 
PRECIPITATION.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY WILL BE SHUNTED EAST 
ON THURSDAY AS TROF OVER THE FOUR CORNERS STARTS TO LIFT OUT. 
SEVERAL WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
WILL JUSTIFY AT LEAST CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY. BEST SUPPORT FOR 
SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION REMAINS OVER OKLAHOMA AND THEN CURVES INTO 
SOUTHWEST MISSOURI SO HIGHER POPS IN THESE AREAS WILL BE NEEDED BUT 
QPF STILL WILL BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE.

WHILE ALL THIS IS GOING ON...THINGS START TO GET INTERESTING IN THE 
WESTERN GULF. MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH DEVELOPING A WAVE 
JUST OFF OF BROWNSVILLE TEXAS AND CARRYING IT NORTHEAST ALONG THE 
GULF COAST. SYSTEM TAPS INTO TROPICAL MOISTURE WITH PWATS IN EXCESS 
OF 1.5 INCHES OVER MOST OF THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE CWA BY 
SATURDAY MORNING. MODELS ALSO CONSISTENT WITH TWO DISTINCT 
SHORTWAVES MOVING THROUGH THE AREA IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AS 
TROF GETS BOGGED DOWN RUNNING INTO THE SURFACE HIGH SITTING OVER THE 
CAROLINAS.

SYSTEM IN THE GULF COMES ON SHORE OVER CENTRAL LOUISIANA LATE 
SATURDAY. LARGE PLUME OF MOISTURE SWINGS THROUGH THE CWA SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON BEFORE MOVING NORTH BY SUNDAY MORNING. SLIVER OF DRY AIR 
OVER THE EASTERN PART OF THE STATE EARLY SATURDAY QUICKLY PUSHED OFF 
TO THE NORTH. LOW SCATTERED POPS EARLY SATURDAY WILL HAVE TO BE 
BOOSTED TO HIGH SCATTERED BY LATE SATURDAY. MEX GUIDANCE COMING IN 
WITH 70 POPS BUT WITH SO MUCH DRY AIR IN PLACE INITIALLY...WONT GO 
ABOVE HIGH SCATTERED AT THIS POINT.  

ANOTHER CONCERN IS THUNDER. UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT ONLY JUSTIFIES 
ISOLATED THUNDER MOST OF THE PERIOD. WILL REWORK THE PRECIP GRIDS TO 
GO WITH ISOLATED THUNDER. EVENT ON SATURDAY ACTUALLY LOOKS TO BE 
MORE STRATIFORM IN NATURE SO WILL GO MORE THAT WAY. AS FAR AS 
TEMPERATURES GO...FWC NUMBERS ARE INITIALLY COOLER AND ACTUALLY FIT 
IN BETTER WITH CURRENT CONDITIONS AS OPPOSED TO THE MAV. WILL LEAN 
MORE TOWARDS THE FWC NUMBERS EARLY BEFORE GOING WITH A BLEND OF 
MAV/FWC NUMBERS LATER IN THE PERIOD.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
WEAK SHORT WAVE ALOFT WILL LINGER JUST TO THE NORTHWEST OF ARKANSAS 
DURING THE FIRST TWO DAYS...THEN IT WILL FILL AND GET OUT OF OUR 
PICTURE ON TUESDAY. IN THE MEANTIME...LONG WAVE TROF OVER THE WEST 
IS STILL ON TRACK TO CUT OFF AND PARK OVER THE WEST COAST. AT THE 
SURFACE...THE LOW OVER THE NORTHERN GULF WILL MOVE ONSHORE AND 
APPROACH ARKANSAS SUNDAY...THEN THE RIDGE IN THE VICINITY OF JAMES 
BAY WILL REGAIN ITS HOLD OVER THE MIDWEST AND PUSH THE LOW BACK TO 
THE COAST NEXT TO THE FLORIDA PAN HANDLE BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. DRIER 
AIR AND CLEARING SKIES WILL RETURN ON TUESDAY. PRECIPITATION SUNDAY 
WILL BE PRIMARILY IN THE FORM OF RAIN...BUT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY ALOFT TO SUPPORT ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. MONDAY WILL 
HAVE THE DRIER AIR UNDER CUTTING THE MOISTURE OVER THE STATE...SO 
THAT STEADY RAIN WILL BE THE PRECIP TYPE FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT. DRY FORECAST FOR TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL SHOW A GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND FOR THE HIGHS AS THE WEATHER DRIES OUT. LOWS WILL DROP 
A BIT BY DAY 7 AS SKIES CLEAR.

HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO HOLD STRONG FROM ARKANSAS INTO ILLINOIS. 
DEWPOINTS ALREADY INTO MID 20S OVER NORTHEAST ARKANSAS. 
HOWEVER...CLOUD COVER FROM DISTURBANCE IN WEST TEXAS MOVING EAST. 
PARTLY CLOUDY WILL SUFFICE TONIGHT...BUT THESE CLOUDS WILL HELP HOLD

THURSDAY. MOISTURE WILL MOVE INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS IN RETURN FLOW 
THURSDAY...BUT WILL BE LIMITED TO THE WEST. MOISTURE WILL BE AROUND 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. HOWEVER...PRECIP LOOKS TO BE SCATTERED FOR

A RATHER BROAD AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES ITS STRONG HOLD OF

WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 20S ACROSS THE NORTHERN SECTIONS RANGING TO 
THE LOWER 50S OVER THE EXTREME SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF ARKANSAS...EXPECT
MINIMUMS TONIGHT TO TAKE A SIGNIFICANT DIVE. THIS DRY AIRMASS OVER 
THE REGION WILL BE SLOW TO MODIFY...MAXIMUMS TOMORROW WILL THEREFORE 
RECOVER TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS. THE CURRENT DRY SPELL WILL LIKELY 
CONTINUE UNTIL ABOUT LATE THURSDAY WHEN THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM 
SHIFTS EAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO TO MOVE 
ACROSS PARTS OF TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA AND INTO SOUTHERN AND WESTERN 
ARKANSAS. THE CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT RAIN WILL INCREASE BY FRIDAY 
INTO FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES FARTHER EAST TO 
ALLOW MORE GULF OF MEXICO MOISTURE INTO ARKANSAS.

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING IN THE GULF WILL LIKELY MOVE ONTO THE COAST 
DURING SATURDAY...WITH UPPER LOW CLOSING OFF OVER THE PLAINS. LOOKS 
TO BE A RAIN PRODUCER FOR THE AREA...AS ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE LIKELY TO 
OCCUR ALONG THE BACK SIDE OF THE SURFACE LOW. NOT ALL THAT CONFIDENT 
OF THUNDERSTORM CHANCES DUE TO LACK OF LARGE SCALE LIFTING BEHIND 
THE SURFACE SYSTEM...HOWEVER UPPER SUPPORT DOES JUSTIFY PUTTING AT 
LEAST ISOLATED THUNDER IN. 

UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL BY TUESDAY...ALLOWING FOR BOTH SYSTEMS 
TO SLIDE EAST OF THE AREA. SOME DRYING WILL OCCUR AS SURFACE RIDGE 
BUILDS INTO THE AREA. UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER TEXAS BY MID

315 AM CDT TUE OCT  5 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MORNING WITH REGARDS TO TIMING 
OF THE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES. ETA HAS BEEN WAFFLING A BIT WITH ITS 
SOLUTION OF LATE WHILE THE GFS HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT. IN 
ADDITION...THE ETA IS NOW THE WEAKEST SOLUTION REGARDING THE 
EVOLUTION OF THE MID LEVEL TROF OVER THE FOUR CORNERS REGION. 
STRONGER GFS SOLUTION IS SUPPORTED BY THE OTHER SHORT TERM MODELS 
AND IS THE PREFERRED CHOICE THIS MORNING.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES WEAK COLD FRONT ROUGHLY ALONG THE 
LOUISIANA AND ARKANSAS BORDER. TEMPERATURE SPREAD ACROSS THE FRONT 
ONLY ABOUT 5 DEGREES THANKS IN PART TO RATHER EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER 
COVERING MOST OF THE STATE. MOST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE WITH THE 
FRONT ARE DEW POINTS...WHICH RANGE FROM THE MID 30S ACROSS THE NORTH 
TO MID 60S OVER THE SOUTH. CLOUD COVER ARE IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
SEVERAL DISTURBANCES EMBEDDED IN THE ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM OF THE 
WESTERLYS.

SURFACE HIGH IN THE UPPER MIDWEST WILL SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST OVER 
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. EAST TO NORTHEAST SURFACE FLOW WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON ADVECTING DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION AND 
CLOUD COVER WILL BREAK UP ENOUGH FOR PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS. 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO COME IN BEHIND THE FRONT WITH 
HIGH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO BE FIVE TO EIGHT DEGREES COOLER ON 
TUESDAY VERSUS MONDAY.

MEANWHILE... A SHORTWAVE TROF IN THE FOUR CORNERS WILL START TO MOVE 
SLOWLY EASTWARD. THIS IN TURN BRINGS RIDGING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
ALL THESE FACTORS COMING TOGETHER WILL KEEP PRECIPITATION AT BAY FOR 
BOTH TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. MODELS ARE ALL CONSISTENT HOWEVER WITH 
BRINGING SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 
THURSDAY MORNING. INCREASE IN MOISTURE SEEMS TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN 
RETURN FLOW ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE RETREATING SURFACE HIGH. MOISTURE 
RETURN AIDED BY UPPER RIDGE AXIS SLIDING OFF TO THE EAST ALLOWING 
FOR SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. EVEN THOUGH MOISTURE BEGINS TO INCREASE 
OVER THE WEST THURSDAY...I AM HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME FINDING ANY 
SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVES OR ANYTHING ELSE THAT WOULD INITIATE PRECIP. 
AIR MASS WILL LIKELY TAKE TIME TO MOISTEN UP SO WILL GO CAUTIOUSLY 
WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR THURSDAY.

FORECAST GETS A BIT MORE INTERESTING ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY AS 
MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH DEVELOPING A WAVE IN THE WESTERN 
GULF BY FRIDAY MORNING. FEATURE SLOWLY STRENGTHENS AS IT DRIFTS 
ALONG THE TEXAS COAST TAKING POSITION OFF GALVESTON BAY BY SATURDAY 
MORNING. MODELS KEEP HIGH QPF SOUTH OF THE STATE THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT AS A SLIVER OF DRY AIR REMAINS OVER THE AREA. WITH SOME 
UNCERTAINTY HERE...WILL NEED TO CONTINUE THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN 
THE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. BASED ON CURRENT 
TRENDS WILL BOOST THE POPS FRIDAY NIGHT OVER THE SOUTH.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...MAV AND FWC GUIDANCE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THIS MORNING AND WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF NUMBERS. WILL BOOST 
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE ON THURSDAY WITH DEEPEST MOISTURE OFF TO THE 
WEST BUT WILL DROP THEM ONCE AGAIN ON FRIDAY WITH INCREASED CLOUD 
COVER AND POSSIBILITY OF SHOWER ACTIVITY. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE 
BELOW NORMAL TUESDAY NIGHT BUT AVERAGE CLOSE TO SEASONABLE THE 
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...
BROAD TROF WILL MOVE CLOSER TO ARKANSAS FROM THE TEXAS-OKLAHOMA PAN 
HANDLES TO START THE LONG TERM. SHORT WAVE WILL WEAKEN OVER 
NORTHEAST TEXAS AS RIDGE AMPLIFIES OVER THE UPPER MID WEST IN 
RESPONSE TO LONG WAVE TROF INTENSIFYING OVER THE WESTERN UNITED 
STATES. THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL DIVE TO THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE 
COUNTRY AND BECOME CUT OFF FROM THE FLOW BEYOND DAY 7. IN THE 
MEANTIME...THE SURFACE PATTERN WILL HAVE A LOW OFF THE UPPER GULF 
COAST REINFORCING THE EASTERLY FLOW ACROSS ARKANSAS ON SATURDAY. 
RAIN CHANCES FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SOUTHERN 
COUNTIES IN LIGHT OF DRIER AIR MOVING IN FROM THE EAST AROUND 
SURFACE HIGH IN THE SOUTHEAST. AT THE SAME TIME...A SQUEEZE PLAY 
WILL TAKE PLACE FROM THE NORTH AS THE NEXT CANADIAN HIGH BRINGS 
SMALL RAIN CHANCES SOUTH FROM MISSOURI SATURDAY. THEN THE HIGH MOVES 
FROM SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA TO THE GREAT LAKES BY MONDAY. RAIN CHANCES 
WILL END FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL KEEP 
CLOSE TO NORMAL..WITH HIGHS IN THE 70S AND LOWS IN THE 50S AND 60S.
&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
FIRE WEATHER STILL A CONCERN THROUGH WEDNESDAY OVER THE NORTHERN AND 
CENTRAL DISTRICTS WITH 10 HOUR FUELS ONLY IN THE SEVEN TO EIGHT 
PERCENTILE. WHILE TWENTY FOOT WINDS WILL REMAIN BELOW RED FLAG 
CRITERIA...DRIER AIR COMING IN BEHIND THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT WILL 
PRODUCE MINIMUM RELATIVE HUMIDITY IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. SOME AREAS ACROSS THE NORTH MAY DROP INTO THE 
UPPER 20S TUESDAY AFTERNOON. HUMIDITY RECOVERY AT NIGHT WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE EXCELLENT. THE CHANCES OF WETTING RAIN ACROSS THE 
NORTH AND CENTRAL DISTRICTS STILL LOOKS MINIMAL THROUGH THE 
REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.

AIR MASS WILL LIKELY TAKE TIME TO MOISTEN UP SO WILL GO CAUTIOUSLY 
WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR THURSDAY.

FORECAST GETS A BIT MORE INTERESTING ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY AS 
MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT WITH DEVELOPING A WAVE IN THE WESTERN 
GULF BY FRIDAY MORNING. FEATURE SLOWLY STRENGTHENS AS IT DRIFTS 
ALONG THE TEXAS COAST TAKING POSITION OFF GALVESTON BAY BY SATURDAY 
MORNING. MODELS KEEP HIGH QPF SOUTH OF THE STATE THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT AS A SLIVER OF DRY AIR REMAINS OVER THE AREA. WITH SOME 
UNCERTAINTY HERE...WILL NEED TO CONTINUE THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN 
THE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. BASED ON CURRENT 
TRENDS WILL BOOST THE POPS FRIDAY NIGHT OVER THE SOUTH.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...MAV AND FWC GUIDANCE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THIS MORNING AND WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF NUMBERS. WILL BOOST 
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE ON THURSDAY WITH DEEPEST MOISTURE OFF TO THE 
WEST BUT WILL DROP THEM ONCE AGAIN ON FRIDAY WITH INCREASED CLOUD 
COVER AND POSSIBILITY OF SHOWER ACTIVITY. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE 
BELOW NORMAL TUESDAY NIGHT BUT AVERAGE CLOSE TO SEASONABLE THE 
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...
BROAD TROF WILL MOVE CLOSER TO ARKANSAS FROM THE TEXAS-OKLAHOMA PAN 
HANDLES TO START THE LONG TERM. SHORT WAVE WILL WEAKEN OVER 
NORTHEAST TEXAS AS RIDGE AMPLIFIES OVER THE UPPER MID WEST IN 
RESPONSE TO LONG WAVE TROF INTENSIFYING OVER THE WESTERN UNITED 
STATES. THIS NEW SYSTEM WILL DIVE TO THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE 
COUNTRY AND BECOME CUT OFF FROM THE FLOW BEYOND DAY 7. IN THE 
MEANTIME...THE SURFACE PATTERN WILL HAVE A LOW OFF THE UPPER GULF 
COAST REINFORCING THE EASTERLY FLOW ACROSS ARKANSAS ON SATURDAY. 
RAIN CHANCES FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL BE LIMITED TO THE SOUTHERN 
COUNTIES IN LIGHT OF DRIER AIR MOVING IN FROM THE EAST AROUND 
SURFACE HIGH IN THE SOUTHEAST. AT THE SAME TIME...A SQUEEZE PLAY

CENTRAL DISTRICTS WITH 10 HOUR FUELS ONLY IN THE SEVEN TO EIGHT 
PERCENTILE. WHILE TWENTY FOOT WINDS WILL REMAIN BELOW RED FLAG

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MORNING WITH REGARDS TO TIMING 
OF THE INDIVIDUAL FEATURES. ETA HAS BEEN WAFFLING A BIT WITH ITS 
SOLUTION OF LATE WHILE THE GFS HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT. IN 
ADDITION...THE ETA IS NOW THE WEAKEST SOLUTION REGARDING THE 
EVOLUTION OF THE MID LEVEL TROF OVER THE FOUR CORNERS REGION. 
STRONGER GFS SOLUTION IS SUPPORTED BY THE OTHER SHORT TERM MODELS 
AND IS THE PREFERRED CHOICE THIS MORNING.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES WEAK COLD FRONT ROUGHLY ALONG THE 
LOUISIANA AND ARKANSAS BORDER. TEMPERATURE SPREAD ACROSS THE FRONT 
ONLY ABOUT 5 DEGREES THANKS IN PART TO RATHER EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER 
COVERING MOST OF THE STATE. MOST NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE WITH THE 
FRONT ARE DEW POINTS...WHICH RANGE FROM THE MID 30S ACROSS THE NORTH 
TO MID 60S OVER THE SOUTH. CLOUD COVER ARE IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
SEVERAL DISTURBANCES EMBEDDED IN THE ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM OF THE 
WESTERLYS.

SURFACE HIGH IN THE UPPER MIDWEST WILL SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST OVER 
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. EAST TO NORTHEAST SURFACE FLOW WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON ADVECTING DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION AND 
CLOUD COVER WILL BREAK UP ENOUGH FOR PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS. 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO COME IN BEHIND THE FRONT WITH 
HIGH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO BE FIVE TO EIGHT DEGREES COOLER ON 
TUESDAY VERSUS MONDAY.

MEANWHILE... A SHORTWAVE TROF IN THE FOUR CORNERS WILL START TO MOVE 
SLOWLY EASTWARD. THIS IN TURN BRINGS RIDGING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
ALL THESE FACTORS COMING TOGETHER WILL KEEP PRECIPITATION AT BAY FOR 
BOTH TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. MODELS ARE ALL CONSISTENT HOWEVER WITH 
BRINGING SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 
THURSDAY MORNING. INCREASE IN MOISTURE SEEMS TO BE NOTHING MORE THAN 
RETURN FLOW ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE RETREATING SURFACE HIGH. MOISTURE 
RETURN AIDED BY UPPER RIDGE AXIS SLIDING OFF TO THE EAST ALLOWING

239 PM CDT MON OCT  4 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
LATEST SATELLITE PICS FIND ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER OVER MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES A COLD FRONT 
SEVERELY LACKING IN SURFACE MOISTURE OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS...NEAR 
FORT SMITH...RUSSELLVILLE...AND SEARCY. RAIN HAS BEEN PREVALENT MOST 
OF THE DAY OVER EXTREME SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...IMMEDIATELY SOUTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. DOUBTFUL IF MANY RETURNS OVER OUR SOUTHERN ARKANSAS 
COUNTIES ARE HITTING THE GROUND...AS THERE CONTINUES TO BE A 
SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE BOUNDARY BETWEEN ELDORADO AND MONTICELLO WITH 
MUCH DRIER AIR IN THE LOWER LEVELS THE FURTHER NORTH YOU GO. 

THIS AREA OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED STORMS WILL CONTINUE MOVING 
EASTWARD TONIGHT...INVOF ASSOCIATED UPPER SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS 
LOUISIANA. CONDS WILL REMAIN DRY OVER MUCH OF ARKANSAS...WITH ONLY 
SOME MID AND HIGH CLOUDS NOTED. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF POPS IN 
THE EXTREME SOUTH FOR TONIGHT. FRONT WILL SLIDE SOUTH AND OUT OF THE 
STATE BY TUESDAY...BRINGING A REINFORCEMENT OF COOLER AIR.

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY LOOK TO BE DRY AS FRONT STALLS OR WASHES OUT 
NEAR THE GULF COAST AND SURFACE RIDGE NOSES INTO NORTHERN ARKANSAS. 
SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE WILL LIE JUST TO THE WEST OF ARKANSAS DURING 
THIS TIME. POSITION OF THE RIDGE WILL ALLOW FOR PREVALENT EASTERLY 
FLOW...SHUTTING OFF AVAILABLE SOURCE OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. 

BY THURSDAY...UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN MOVING NORTHEAST UP OUT OF THE 
GULF. SURFACE RIDGE WILL HEAD EASTWARD...WITH RETURN FLOW SETTING UP 
ONCE AGAIN.
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
SOME AMPLIFICATION OF THE UPPER AIR FLOW OVER NORTH AMERICA WILL 
OCCUR EARLY IN THIS PERIOD. MEDIUM RANGE MODEL SOLUTIONS DO VARY 
WITH THE FINER SCALE ELEMENTS IN THIS FLOW. AT THIS TIME WILL LEAN 
TOWARDS THE DRIER SOLUTIONS...GIVEN RECENT TRENDS. 
&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE HAS BROUGHT A REINFORCING SHOT OF DRY 
AIR...ESPECIALLY TO THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL DISTRICTS. WHILE WINDS

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
310 AM CDT MON OCT  4 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
SHORT RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM 
WITH NUMEROUS SHORTWAVES MOVING THROUGH THE MEAN FLOW. AS EXPECTED 
IN THIS TYPE OF PATTERN...THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING AND 
STRENGTH OF THE INDIVIDUAL WAVES WITH THE GFS A BIT FASTER AND 
STRONGER. ETA SOLUTION HAS COME MORE IN LINE WITH THE CONSISTENT GFS 
BUT NOT SURE OF THE STRONGER AND FASTER SCENARIO WITH THE AMOUNT OF
SURFACE PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. THAT BEING SAID...FEEL A 
BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS IS IN ORDER THIS MORNING.

IT APPEARS RETURN FLOW IS STARTING TO SET UP ACROSS THE WESTERN AND 
SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE STATE. DEW POINTS HAVE CLIMBED BACK INTO THE 
LOWER 60S ACROSS THE SOUTH AND MID 50S OVER THE WEST WHILE DEW 
POINTS REMAIN IN THE 40S ACROSS THE EAST. RETURN FLOW IS WEAK AT 
BEST WITH SURFACE WINDS BEING VERY LIGHT AND FLOW ALOFT IS ZONAL. 
WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY STILL PROGGED TO DROP DOWN FROM THE NORTH BUT 
IT LOOKS DRY UNTIL IT REACHES THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE STATE.

ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM MOVES A SHORTWAVE ACROSS NORTHERN LOUISIANA 
AT ABOUT ROUGHLY THE SAME TIME THE FRONT ARRIVES. WILL KEEP SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS OVER THE SOUTHWEST WITH REMAINDER OF CWA 
REMAINING DRY. GFS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS FEATURE BUT APPEARS TO 
BE SOMEWHAT OVERDONE.

MID LEVEL TROF WILL CONTINUE TO DIG OVER THE FOUR CORNERS ON TUESDAY 
WITH DOWN STREAM RIDGING IN RESPONSE OVER THE MID SOUTH. MOISTURE  
TRIES TO STREAM INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST BUT HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE OHIO VALLEY WILL KEEP DEEPER MOISTURE OFF TO THE SOUTH AND WEST 
OF THE CWA. ETA SWINGS A WAVE ACROSS THE SOUTH WHILE THE GFS MAKES 
NO MENTION OF IT. WILL BE FORCED TO CARRY SLIGHT POPS MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS FEATURE. 

SURFACE HIGH SLIPS OFF TO THE EAST WEDNESDAY AS AFOREMENTIONED 
TROUGH APPROACHES WITH BETTER MOISTURE RETURN BUT AGAIN... DEEPEST 
MOISTURE REMAINS TO THE WEST AND SOUTH. SEVERAL WAVES PASS NEAR THE 
AREA BUT STAY TO THE NORTH OR WEST AND CAN ONLY JUSTIFY SLIGHT 
CHANCES POPS OVER PARTS OF THE AREA. STRONGER WAVE PASSES OVER THE 
AREA THURSDAY NIGHT FOR ADDITIONAL POPS. 

EVEN THOUGH POPS ARE IN THE FORECAST THROUGH OUT...RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
ARE EXPECTED TO BE LOW AS DEEPEST MOISTURE REMAINS TO THE WEST AND 
SOUTH. IN ADDITION...SURFACE WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE EAST TO 
NORTHEAST FROM THIS AFTERNOON UNTIL MIDDAY THURSDAY WHEN MORE OF A 
SOUTHERLY COMPONENT IS INTRODUCED. THIS WIND FLOW WILL TRY TO ADVECT 
IN DRIER AIR FROM THE EAST WHICH WILL INHIBIT PRECIPITATION CHANCES 
EVEN MORE. PATTERN NOT A DRY WEATHER BUSTER BY ANY MEANS.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES....FLOW IS BASICALLY ZONAL UNTIL WEDNESDAY 
WHEN WINDS ALOFT WILL BECOME MORE SOUTHWEST. WARMEST DAY WILL BE 
TODAY BEFORE A REINFORCING SHOT OF COOL AIR COMES IN BEHIND THE 
FRONT. WITH EASTERLY SURFACE COMPONENT AND INCREASED MOISTURE...WILL 
KEEP TEMPERATURES PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE DAYS TUESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY. 
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES ITS TREK EAST WHILE AMPLIFYING OVER THE GREAT 
PLAINS FROM CANADA INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. AT THE 
SAME TIME...A LOW KEEPS SLIDING EAST UNDER THE RIDGE OVER THE TEXAS 
AND OKLAHOMA PAN HANDLES UNTIL 00Z SAT. THEN THE LOW FILLS AND OPENS 
AS IT GETS PUSHED NORTHEAST BY THE NEXT SHORT WAVE CROSSING THE 
NORTHERN ROCKIES SATURDAY NIGHT. A WEAK SHOT OF ENERGY WILL REMAIN 
OVER THE STATE FOR SUNDAY. AT THE SURFACE...MOISTURE MOVES ACROSS 
ARKANSAS FROM WEST TO EAST AS RIDGE DROPS FROM THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
TO THE MID ATLANTIC COAST. RAIN CHANCES WILL RANGE FROM 30 PERCENT 
ON FRIDAY TO 20 PERCENT BY SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MAINLY IN 
THE 70S FOR HIGHS AND IN THE 50S FOR LOWS.
&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
TEN HOUR FUEL MOISTURE HAS DROPPED INTO THE FIVE TO SIX PERCENTILE 
ACROSS PARTS OF THE CWA WITH BURN BANS CONTINUING ACROSS MANY PARTS 
OF THE STATE. SOME MOISTURE HAS RETURNED TO THE SOUTH AND WEST BUT 
MINIMUM HUMIDITY IS STILL EXPECTED TO BOTTOM OUT IN THE MID 30S 
ACROSS MANY PARTS OF NORTHERN ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON. DRIER AIR
WILL ADVECT INTO THE AREA TONIGHT WITH MINIMUM RH IN THE LOWER 30S 
EXPECTED TUESDAY AFTERNOON. EVEN THOUGH HUMIDITY IS APPROACHING RED 
FLAG CRITERIA... WILL NOT ISSUE ANY HIGHLIGHTS AS 20 FOOT WINDS WILL 
REMAIN WELL BELOW 14 MPH. WHILE RECOVERIES AT NIGHT WILL BE 
EXCELLENT AND SCATTERED PRECIPITATION IS POSSIBLE...THE CHANCES OF 
WETTING RAIN WILL BE MINIMAL THIS WEEK. HIGHER DEW POINTS

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
300 AM CDT SUN OCT 3 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT
UPPER LEVEL FLOW HAS NOT CHANGED SIGNIFICANTLY FROM YESTERDAY. A 
STRONG VORTEX CONTINUES ROTATING OVER THE HUDSON BAY AREA...WITH 
ZONAL FLOW ACROSS ARKANSAS. A SHORT WAVE IS STILL PROGGED TO UNDER 
CUT THE RIDGE OVER THE ROCKIES. TROF WILL BE AMPLIFYING FROM 00Z TUE 
INTO 12Z TUE. AS THE SHORT WAVE GETS CLOSER TO ARKANSAS IT WILL 
BEGIN INFLUENCING OUR WEATHER AFTER 12Z WED. THE SURFACE PATTERN 
STILL SHOWS A RIDGE MOVING OFF TO THE EAST OF ARKANSAS AND ALLOWING 
MOISTURE TO PUSH NORTH ON ITS BACK SIDE. THE RIDGE MOVES EAST 
SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN THE 00Z RUN YESTERDAY. THIS WILL TRANSLATE INTO 
THAT MOISTURE ENTERING THE STATE FROM THE WEST FASTER THAN EXPECTED 
BEFORE. INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR DAYTIME WEDNESDAY AND 
CONTINUED THEM INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE MOISTURE RETURN WILL RESULT 
IN MORE CLOUDS AND COOLER TEMPERATURES SO HIGHS WILL BE MAINLY IN 
THE 70S AND LOWS MAINLY IN THE 50S.
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
MODELS THIS MORNING A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH RETURNING MOISTURE 
TO THE AREA THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE PERIOD VERSUS THE PAST SEVERAL 
NIGHTS. WITH SURFACE HIGH MOVING OFF THE EAST COAST OF THE COUNTRY 
AT THE START OF THE PERIOD...RETURN FLOW IS LIKELY BUT NOT TO THE 
EXTENT THE MODELS... ESPECIALLY THE GFS ARE SHOWING. MEX NUMBERS ARE 
OFF THE CHART WITH 70 PLUS POPS IN THE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TIME 
FRAME AND SEEN WAY OVERDONE. THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A BLEND 
OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS MORNING WITH REGARDS TO POSITION AND 
TIMING OF THE FEATURES BUT I WILL CUT BACK OF THE POPS WHICH AGAIN 
APPEAR TO BE OVERDONE.

SURFACE HIGH WILL BE JUST OFF THE EAST COAST AT THE ONSET OF THE 
PERIOD WITH RETURN FLOW SETTING UP. SEVERAL WEAK SHORTWAVES SEEM TO 
BE EMBEDDED IN THE SOUTHERN STREAM WITH THE USUAL TIMING CONCERNS TO 
DEAL WITH. ONLY SCATTERED POPS SEEM TO BE WARRANTED AS AIR MASS WILL 
TAKE SOME TIME TO GET JUICED UP ENOUGH TO SUPPORT PRECIP. COME 
FRIDAY...ALL MODELS ARE GENERATING A WEAK SURFACE WAVE IN THE 
WESTERN GULF. THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE INTENSITY OF THE LOW BUT 
THE MODELS ARE FAIRLY SIMILAR IN CARRYING IT ALONG THE GULF COAST 
THROUGH DAY SEVEN. WITH PROXIMITY OF LOW WILL NEED TO INTRODUCE 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR DAYS SIX AND SEVEN BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT 
OVERLY HIGH AT THIS POINT DEPENDING UPON WHAT THIS FEATURE ENDS UP 
DOING.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...WITH INCREASED MOISTURE AND CLOUD COVER I 
DECIDED TO CUT BACK ON THE HIGH TEMPS A FEW DEGREES TO BRING THEM 
MORE IN LINE WITH THE MEX GUIDANCE WHICH LOOKS REASONABLE. DAY TIME 
HIGHS WILL STILL AVERAGE VERY CLOSE TO SEASONABLE NORMS WHILE 
OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL AVERAGE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

&&

.FIRE WEATHER...
10 HOUR FUEL MOISTURE REMAINS IN THE SEVEN TO NINE PERCENTILE ACROSS 
MOST OF CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING WITH NUMEROUS 
COUNTIES IMPOSING BURN BANS. AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES ARE EXPECTED TO 
BOTTOM OUT IN THE LOWER 30S ACROSS THE NORTH WITH SOME UPPER 20S NOT 
OUT OF THE QUESTION. CONDITIONS ARE FAVORABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 
AND SPREAD OF FIRES THROUGH WEDNESDAY WHEN MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO 
INCREASE BUT THE CHANCE OF WETTING RAIN STILL APPEARS LOW. EXCELLENT 
RECOVERIES OF RELATIVE HUMIDITY ARE LIKELY AT NIGHT. WINDS WILL 
REMAIN WELL BELOW RED FLAG CRITERIA OTHERWISE A FIRE WEATHER WATCH 
WOULD HAVE BEEN CONSIDERED FOR A MAJORITY OF THE COUNTY WARNING 
AREA.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA TONIGHT. GUIDANCE CAME IN
WITH MILDER MINS FOR TONIGHT THAN WHAT IS FORECAST BUT WITH THE 
SURFACE RIDGE IN NORTHERN SECTIONS...LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE A GOOD
NIGHT FOR RADIATIONAL COOLING SO KEPT MINS ABOUT WHERE THEY WERE
EXCEPT FOR MAYBE A DEGREE OR TWO INCREASE IN A FEW PLACES. MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS SUPPORT GOOD 
RADIATIONAL WARMING SO DID GO A LITTLE HIGHER ON MAXES AS SUGGESTED 
BY GUIDANCE. NEXT FRONT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. A WEAK
SHORT WAVE MOVES NEAR THE AREA WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE
MOSTLY TO THE WEST. LOOKS MARGINAL FOR SMALL POPS MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY...ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST. DECIDED TO LEAVE MENTION OF RAIN
OUT FOR NOW BUT WILL HAVE TO VISIT THIS AGAIN TOMORROW. 
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
RIDGE BEGINS BUILDING OVER THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY. MOISTURE WILL 
RETURN HOWEVER ON A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW. AS THE SURFACE HIGH MOVES

THEREFORE WILL INCLUDE JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AFTERNOON. DRIER AIR MOVES IN FOR SATURDAY SO 
WILL NOT INCLUDE ANY POPS ON SATURDAY.

SATURDAY AFTERNOON SHOULD SEE THE ENERGY TO THE EAST OF ARKANSAS 
WILL ALL ITS ACCOMPANYING PRECIPITATION HAVING BEEN PUSHED TO THE 
SOUTHEAST ALONG WITH THE COLD FRONT AT THE SURFACE. FROM SATURDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY NIGHT THE FLOW WILL BE ZONAL ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
TIER OF STATES. RIDGE OVER THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST WILL AMPLIFY AND IT 
WILL ALLOW THE WESTERLIES TO DIP SOUTHEAST OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST 
AND BOTTOM OUT AROUND THE GREAT LAKES. BY 12Z WEDNESDAY A WEAK SHORT 
WAVE WILL BE UNDER CUTTING THE WESTERN RIDGE AND APPROACHING THE 
STATE ACROSS THE CENTRAL ROCKIES. ONCE THE SURFACE FRONT EXITS THE 
STATE ON DAY 1...COOL AND DRY AIR WILL KEEP ARKANSAS IN PLEASANT 
CONDITIONS FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. ANOTHER SURFACE HIGH WILL DROP 
SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE CANADIAN ROCKIES UNDER THE NORTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT. THIS WILL BRING A DRY...COLD FRONT INTO THE STATE MONDAY. 
MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED WITH THIS SYSTEM AND ANY SIGNIFICANT 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE FALLING TO OUR WEST AS MOISTURE POOLS AGAINST 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE RIDGE. DRY FORECAST FROM 
DAY 2 ON INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. FWC AND MAV NUMBERS SIMILAR AND 
REASONABLE.

MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT THIS MORNING VERSUS PREVIOUS ONES

LATE BY GENERATING A CUT OFF LOW OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WHILE OTHER 
MODELS WERE NOT NEARLY AS AGGRESSIVE. LATEST GFS RUN NOW IN 
AGREEMENT WITH OTHER MODELS WITH SWINGING NOTHING MORE THAN A 
SHORTWAVE ACROSS THE AREA LATE IN THE PERIOD. WILL CONTINUE TO GO 
WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS BUT CONFIDENCE IS A LITTLE BETTER 
CONCERNING THE FINAL OUTCOME THAN MORNINGS PAST.

PATTERN STARTS OFF WITH HIGH PRESSURE BOTH ALOFT AND ON THE SURFACE 
IN CONTROL WITH JUST A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE LATE IN THE 
PERIOD AS AFOREMENTIONED WAVE APPROACHES. SOUTHERN STREAM CARRIES 
THIS FEATURE THROUGH SOUTHERN MISSOURI/NORTHEAST ARKANSAS LATE 
THURSDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. FEATURE NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE AND 
ACTUALLY WEAKENS WITH TIME AND NOTHING MORE THAN OCCASIONAL 
CLOUDINESS IS EXPECTED. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS FOR FRIDAY SO WILL 
KEEP THE CURRENT THINKING OF A DRY EXTENDED PERIOD.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...SURFACE PATTERN WILL KEEP SOME TYPE OF 
EASTERLY COMPONENT TO THE WIND DURING THE ENTIRE PERIOD WITH NEAR 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED. LATEST MEX NUMBERS SUPPORT NEAR NORMAL 
TEMPS AND ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED. WILL NEED TO TRIM TEMPS BACK A

OUT OF THE FORECAST BY AFTERNOON IN ALL BUT THE SOUTHEAST. SURFACE
HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES IN FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY IN THE

SURFACE RIDGE CONTINUES ACROSS ARKANSAS WITH DRIER AIR REMAINING IN 
PLACE...DEW POINTS IN MID 40S TO MID 50S. BETTER MOISTURE AXIS IS
ACROSS KANSAS AND OKLAHOMA AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 
PRESSURE RISES SUPPORT CONTINUED MOVEMENT OF THE COLD FRONT TOWARD
THE AREA AND UPPER ANALYSIS SHOWS RATHER STRONG UPPER TROF SWINGING
INTO THE CENTRAL U.S. WHICH SHOULD HELP SUPPORT THE FRONT AS IT MOVES
IN. AREA OF MOSTLY WARM ADVECTION RAINS CONTINUES IN NORTHWESTERN 
SECTIONS BUT IT IS UNABLE TO PENETRATE FAR INTO THE STATE DUE TO 
THE DRIER AIR STILL IN PLACE. SOME HIGHER DEW POINT AIR IS POISED TO
THE SOUTH AND IF THE SURFACE RIDGE CAN BREAK DOWN THIS MOISTURE COULD
MOVE INTO MUCH OF THE AREA AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. 

SENT OUT UPDATE MAINLY TO CLEAN UP MORNING WORDING. KEPT POPS FOR
THIS AFTERNOON ABOUT AS THEY WERE BUT DID BUMP UP A LITTLE IN THE
NORTHWEST WHERE THE RAIN IS. MAX TEMPS MAY BE A REACH IN PARTS OF
THE NORTH AND WEST DUE TO ONGOING CLOUD COVER AND RAIN BUT LEFT THEM

ALONG THE FRONT TO THE WEST OF THE AREA LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND
MOVE IN DURING THE NIGHT CONTINUING INTO SATURDAY. INSTABILITY
LOOKING MORE IN QUESTION ESPECIALLY IF THE SURFACE RIDGE HANGS IN

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
MOST OF THE UPPER LEVEL ENERGY WILL BE WELL TO THE NORTH OF THE 
STATE IN THE SHORT TERM. WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH THE 
NORTHWEST CORNER OF ARKANSAS HAS TRIGGERED ONLY MINOR ECHOES. THE 
NEXT SHORT WAVE WILL BEGIN ITS INFLUENCE ON OUR WEATHER FRIDAY NIGHT 
INTO SATURDAY MORNING BY PROVIDING THE PUSH FOR THE SURFACE COLD 
FRONT. AFTER SATURDAY MORNING...THE FLOW TAKES ON A ZONAL 
CONFIGURATION WITH NO TRIGGERS. MEANWHILE AT THE SURFACE...MOISTURE 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. RH VALUES LIFT TO 
THE NORTH...WITH THE HIGHER CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION EXPECTED TO 
FALL ACROSS THE NORTH AND DECREASE TOWARD THE CENTRAL SECTIONS. 
SMALL POPS WILL AFFECT THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES TODAY. NEXT...THE COLD 
FRONT WILL ENTER THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF ARKANSAS OVERNIGHT TONIGHT 
AND IT WILL BE PUSHING OUT OF THE STATE THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST CORNER 
AFTER SUNRISE SATURDAY. POPS WILL DECREASE QUICKLY FROM THE 
NORTHWEST TO THE SOUTHEAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT TRICKY TODAY IN LIGHT OF THE DIFFERENCE 
IN THE GUIDANCE VALUES. THE GFS HAS THE HIGHER POPS AND LOWER TEMPS 
COMPARED TO THE FWC NUMBERS. BELIEVE THAT THE LOWER POPS WILL BE 
CLOSER TO WHAT WILL HAPPEN...SO EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO RISE MORE 
THAT THE GFS SUGGESTS. ONCE THE COLD FRONT CROSSES THE STATE...MOS 
NUMBERS CONVERGE IN LIGHT OF THE COOLER AND MUCH DRIER AIR 
ACCOMPANYING THE SURFACE RIDGE.
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
MODELS THIS MORNING START OFF FAIRLY CONSISTENT BUT DIVERGE TOWARDS 
THE END OF THE PERIOD. BIGGEST DIFFERENCE IN THE MODELS IS THE 
DEVELOPMENT...OR LACK OF IN SOME CASES...OF AN UPPER LOW OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. GFS IS THE MOST AGGRESSIVE 
WITH THIS FEATURE WHILE THE CANADIAN AND ECMWF SOLUTIONS REALLY DO 
NOT HIT IT VERY HARD. SINCE WE ARE TALKING ABOUT DAY SEVEN FEEL THE 
BEST SOLUTION WILL BE TO SPLIT THE DIFFERENCES AND GO WITH A 
COMPROMISE SOLUTION.

PATTERN OVERALL IS PROGRESSIVE AND BEGINS WITH NORTHWEST FLOW OVER 
THE AREA AND HIGH PRESSURE ON THE SURFACE. HIGH WILL DOMINATE 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS BROAD RIDGING BEGINS TO BUILD OVER THE NATIONS 
MID SECTION. DIFFERENCES COME INTO PLAY THURSDAY AS GFS DEVELOPS THE
UPPER LOW WHILE THE OTHER MODELS ARE DEVELOPING MORE OF A TROF AS 
OPPOSED TO A CUT OFF LOW. MODELS KEEPING A GENERALLY EASTERLY 
SURFACE FLOW THROUGH THE PERIOD. SINCE NONE OF THE MODELS BRING ANY 
DEEP MOISTURE TO THE AREA OR GENERATE PRECIPITATION THROUGH THURSDAY 
WILL CONTINUE THE DRY FORECAST BUT KEEP A WARY EYE ON WHATS GOING ON 
IN THE LATTER PERIODS. 

GUIDANCE KEEPING TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO NORMAL THROUGH THE PERIOD 
WITH MILD DAYS AND COOL NIGHTS. SOME WARMING IS LIKELY ON THURSDAY 
WITH TEMPERATURES A TAD ABOVE SEASONAL NORMS. MEX GUIDANCE LOOKS 
GOOD AND IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

255 PM CDT THU SEP 30 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
CLEAR SKIES CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. VERY DRY AIR IS 
STILL OVER MUCH OF THE AREA. DEW POINTS ARE MAINLY IN THE 40S. 
HOWEVER...DEW POINTS IN THE MID 50S ARE STARTING TO WORK INTO THE 
SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF THE STATE ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
DEPARTING HIGH PRESSURE. 

A SHORT WAVE WILL ROTATE THROUGH THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TONIGHT AND 
BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MAINLY WESTERN 
SECTIONS AFTER MIDNIGHT. WILL SPREAD PRECIPITATION EASTWARD ON 
FRIDAY. WITH THE VERY LOW DEW POINTS IN PLACE...WILL NEED TO SEE A 
CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN MOISTURE BEFORE WE WILL GET RAIN AT THE 
SURFACE. THIS MAY DELAY THE ONSET OF THE RAIN. 

A COLD FRONT IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL MOVE RAPIDLY SOUTHWARD AND 
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA ON SATURDAY. MODELS ARE IN FAIR AGREEMENT 
WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT. THE FRONT SHOULD ENTER NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS LATE FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL EXPECT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE FRONT SATURDAY. MOST PRECIP WILL END BY 
SATURDAY EVENING AS THE FRONT WILL BE MOVING ALONG QUICKLY. COOLER 
AND DRIER AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE. THIS LIKELY WILL BE THE COOLEST AIR OF THE 
SEASON WITH LOWS AROUND 40 IN THE NORTH SUNDAY MORNING. DRY 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE TAKES CONTROL. 
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL DOMINATE THE AREA NEXT WEEK. A REINFORCING
COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY WITH SOME MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH 
IT. DECIDED TO STICK IN SMALL POPS FOR MONDAY FOR THIS WITH POPS
DECREASING FROM THE NORTH LATE IN THE DAY. ANOTHER FRONT MOVES IN
LATER IN THE WEEK. GFS CLOSES OFF AN UPPER LOW IN THE AREA TOWARD 
THE END OF NEXT WEEK. HAVE SOME QUESTION ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF
THAT AT THIS TIME BUT PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE ANY PRECIP WOULD 
BE BEYOND DAY 7. KEPT MENTION OF PRECIP OUT THROUGH THURSDAY
FOR NOW. DID LOWER TEMP FORECASTS A LITTLE THROUGH THE PERIOD

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
255 PM CDT THU SEP 30 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
CLEAR SKIES CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. VERY DRY AIR IS 
STILL OVER MUCH OF THE AREA. DEW POINTS ARE MAINLY IN THE 40S. 
HOWEVER...DEW POINTS IN THE MID 50S ARE STARTING TO WORK INTO THE 
SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST PORTIONS OF THE STATE ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
DEPARTING HIGH PRESSURE. 

A SHORT WAVE WILL ROTATE THROUGH THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TONIGHT AND 
BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MAINLY WESTERN 
SECTIONS AFTER MIDNIGHT. WILL SPREAD PRECIPITATION EASTWARD ON 
FRIDAY. WITH THE VERY LOW DEW POINTS IN PLACE...WILL NEED TO SEE A 
CONSIDERABLE INCREASE IN MOISTURE BEFORE WE WILL GET RAIN AT THE 
SURFACE. THIS MAY DELAY THE ONSET OF THE RAIN. 

A COLD FRONT IN THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL MOVE RAPIDLY SOUTHWARD AND 
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA ON SATURDAY. MODELS ARE IN FAIR AGREEMENT 
WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT. THE FRONT SHOULD ENTER NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS LATE FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL EXPECT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE FRONT SATURDAY. MOST PRECIP WILL END BY 
SATURDAY EVENING AS THE FRONT WILL BE MOVING ALONG QUICKLY. COOLER 
AND DRIER AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE. THIS LIKELY WILL BE THE COOLEST AIR OF THE 
SEASON WITH LOWS AROUND 40 IN THE NORTH SUNDAY MORNING. DRY 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE TAKES CONTROL. 
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL DOMINATE THE AREA NEXT WEEK. A REINFORCING
COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY WITH SOME MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH 
IT. DECIDED TO STICK IN SMALL POPS FOR MONDAY FOR THIS WITH POPS
DECREASING FROM THE NORTH LATE IN THE DAY. ANOTHER FRONT MOVES IN
LATER IN THE WEEK. GFS CLOSES OFF AN UPPER LOW IN THE AREA TOWARD 
THE END OF NEXT WEEK. HAVE SOME QUESTION ABOUT THE VALIDITY OF
THAT AT THIS TIME BUT PRESENT INDICATIONS ARE ANY PRECIP WOULD 
BE BEYOND DAY 7. KEPT MENTION OF PRECIP OUT THROUGH THURSDAY
FOR NOW. DID LOWER TEMP FORECASTS A LITTLE THROUGH THE PERIOD
TO FIT NEW GUIDANCE.

235 AM CDT THU SEP 30 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY
FORECAST AREA CLEAR AS A BELL THIS MORNING AS SFC HIGH PRESSURE IS 
ANCHORED INVOF SOUTHEASTERN MISSOURI. CONDITIONS QUITE PLEASANT WITH 
DEWPOINTS RANGING FROM NEAR 40 TO THE LOWER 50S OVER MUCH OF THE 
AREA. MOISTURE WILL BEGIN INCREASING LATER TODAY AS THE SURFACE HIGH 
SLIDES OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST AND WINDS GAIN A MORE SOUTHERLY 
COMPONENT. 

NO DOUBT...TEMPS WILL BE WARMER TONIGHT...AS CLOUDS INCREASE FROM 
THE WEST OUT AHEAD OF APPROACHING SHORTWAVE. THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING 
THE NEXT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO NORTHWESTERN 
ARKANSAS TOWARD FRIDAY MORNING. NEXT ROUND WILL COME ON FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AS STRONGER COLD FRONT MOVES INTO NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS. 

MOST SHORT RANGE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT QUITE AS AGGRESSIVE AS THE 
ETA...WHICH INDICATES A LINE OF STRONG STORMS FORMING AND MOVING 
THROUGH DURING THE NIGHT. WHILE THIS MAY BE THE CASE...GFS/UKMET/
CANADIAN SOLUTIONS SHOW MORE STRONG UPPER SUPPORT WITH THE SYSTEM TO 
THE NORTH OVER THE MID/UPR MS VALLEY...AND TO THE SOUTHWEST NEAR 
DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW. THIS HAS BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT...SO WILL 
STICK WITH THIS SOLUTION. 

HIGHEST POPS WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHWESTERN ZONES FRIDAY 
MORNING...THEN ACROSS THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY 
NIGHT...AS FRONT AND ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH MAKES ITS WAY ACROSS. 
AS FAR AS THE CHANCE OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS...AT THIS 
TIME...FEEL THAT ANY WILL BE ISOLATED AT BEST...GIVEN THAT THE 
STRONGEST UPPER SUPPORT WILL BE AWAY FROM THE AREA...AND DAYTIME 
HEATING WILL BE LOST ONCE THE FRONT MOVES INTO ARKANSAS. HOWEVER...
LOOKING AT FORECAST SOUNDINGS...INSTABILITY PARAMETERS WILL 
CERTAINLY PRESENT...ALONG WITH UPR JET DYNAMICS OF 85 KNOTS OR 
GREATER. 

FELL THAT THE MORE SIGNIFICANT FEATURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM 
WILL BE THE COLD AIR MOVING IN BEHIND IT. IN FACT...THE HIGH 
PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL ACT TO PUSH THE FRONT TO THE SOUTH OF THE 
STATE WILL USHER IN THE COOLEST TEMPERATURES SINCE THE EARLY SPRING. 
THE FRONT SHOULD CLEAR SOUTHEASTERN ARKANSAS BY LATE AFTERNOON 
SATURDAY...WITH TEMPERATURES STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE DAYTIME HOURS. LOWS ON SATURDAY NIGHT ARE EXPECTED 
TO FALL INTO THE LOWER 40S NORTH TO THE LOWER 50S SOUTH. SOME OF THE 
VALLEY AREAS OF NORTHERN AND NORTHWEST ARKANSAS MAY DROP BELOW 40 
DEGREES. 

FOR SHORT TERM TEMPS...TENDED TO BLEND GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST FEW 
PERIODS...AS MOS IS IN GENERALLY GOOD AGREEMENT. NOT SURPRISINGLY...
STRONG DISAGREEMENT ARISES FOR SATURDAYS MAX TEMPERATURES. TENDED TO

SUNNY SKIES WERE THE GENERAL RULE ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. AS 
HIGH PRESSURE MOVED IN AND SUBSIDENCE INCREASED...THE SCATTERED 
CLOUDS FROM THE MORNING DISSIPATED. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL CONTINUE 
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. 

AN UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST 
TONIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW A STRONG UPPER LOW TO DROP SOUTH THROUGH 
CANADA LATE THURSDAY. MODELS SEEM TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS 
NEXT SYSTEM. THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW WILL MOVE INTO 
THE PLAINS FRIDAY. SOUTHWEST FLOW RETURNS FOR FRIDAY BRINGING A 
SHORT WAVE ACROSS THE AREA AHEAD OF THE FRONT...AND THIS WILL BRING 
A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
ARKANSAS ON SATURDAY AND BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH RATHER QUICKLY AND 
PRECIPITATION SHOULD END BY SATURDAY EVENING. MUCH OF THE ENERGY AND 
MOISTURE WILL REMAIN NORTH OF ARKANSAS SO SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT 
ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME.  

ANOTHER SHOT OF COOL DRY AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. 
THE COLDEST LOWS OF THE SEASON ARE EXPECTED SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY MORNING. MUCH OF THE NORTH WILL BE IN THE 40S. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
STRONG UPPER TROF WILL HAVE PASSED THROUGH THE AREA BY SUNDAY WITH
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT COVERING THE AREA. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD BE 
WELL PAST THE AREA WITH UNSEASONABLY COOL AND DRY AIR IN PLACE. 
ANOTHER REINFORCING FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH ON MONDAY AND A SECOND
REINFORCING FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY. 
SURFACE RIDGE FROM THE NORTHEAST WILL KEEP RETURN FLOW FROM SETTING
UP AHEAD OF THE MONDAY FRONT SO WILL NOT HAVE ANY POPS WITH THAT.
SOME RETURN FLOW SETS UP NEXT WEDNESDAY AS THE SECOND FRONT 
APPROACHES BUT INDICATIONS ARE THAT MOISTURE WILL BE INSUFFICIENT
TO MENTION POPS THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MADE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY
DECAYING SURFACE FRONT...OR THE REMNANTS OF IT VERY DIFFICULT TO 
FIND THIS MORNING. BASED ON PRESSURE TENDENCIES...DEWPOINTS AND WIND 
SPEEDS...APPEARS TO BE SAGGING FROM SOUTHWESTERN MISSOURI...TOWARD 
CENTRAL ARKANSAS...DOWN TOWARD THE DELTA REGION OF SOUTHEAST 
ARKANSAS. LITTLE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM IN THE LOWER 
LEVELS...THUS ONLY ALTOCU AND CIRRUS HAVE BEEN NOTED DURING THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS...WITH A LITTLE BIT OF STRATOCU IN THE ARKANSAS 
RIVER VALLEY...AND IN THE WHITE RIVER VALLEY OF NORTH CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS. 

REMNANTS OF THE WEAK BOUNDARY WILL SAG FURTHER SOUTHWARD TODAY. MAIN 
FEATURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOUNDARY WILL BE REINFORCING SHOT OF 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR. READINGS TODAY WILL BE COOLER...WITH HIGHS 
MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 70S NORTH TO LOWER 80S SOUTH. READINGS TONIGHT 
WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE MID 40S NORTH TO THE LOWER 50S SOUTH...AS 
SURFACE RIDGE PUSHES SOUTHWARD FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND 
ALLOWS CLOUDS TO BREAK UP. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE READINGS 
TANK TOWARD THE 40 DEGREE MARK IN SOME OF THE VALLEYS OF NORTHWEST 
AND NORTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS. 

500 MB RIDGE BUILDING OVER WEST/SOUTH TEXAS WILL SEND REMNANTS OF 
THE OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY BACK TO THE NORTH ON THURSDAY. RETURN FLOW 
WILL SET UP...THUS TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT WARMER ON THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY FRIDAY 
MORNING...AS INITIAL WAVE OF MOISTURE AND UPPER SUPPORT HEAD 
NORTHEAST IN THE MEAN FLOW. BEST CHANCES WILL BE OVER NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS...GENERALLY NORTH OF A WALDRON TO MOUNTAIN HOME LINE. THIS 
AREA WILL SEE THE BEST UPPER SUPPORT.

COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO ARKANSAS BY FRIDAY NIGHT. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AS THE 
SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS. SUCCESSIVE MODEL RUNS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN

247 AM CDT WED SEP 29 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY
DECAYING SURFACE FRONT...OR THE REMNANTS OF IT VERY DIFFICULT TO 
FIND THIS MORNING. BASED ON PRESSURE TENDENCIES...DEWPOINTS AND WIND 
SPEEDS...APPEARS TO BE SAGGING FROM SOUTHWESTERN MISSOURI...TOWARD 
CENTRAL ARKANSAS...DOWN TOWARD THE DELTA REGION OF SOUTHEAST 
ARKANSAS. LITTLE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM IN THE LOWER 
LEVELS...THUS ONLY ALTOCU AND CIRRUS HAVE BEEN NOTED DURING THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS...WITH A LITTLE BIT OF STRATOCU IN THE ARKANSAS 
RIVER VALLEY...AND IN THE WHITE RIVER VALLEY OF NORTH CENTRAL 
ARKANSAS. 

REMNANTS OF THE WEAK BOUNDARY WILL SAG FURTHER SOUTHWARD TODAY. MAIN 
FEATURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOUNDARY WILL BE REINFORCING SHOT OF 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR. READINGS TODAY WILL BE COOLER...WITH HIGHS 
MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 70S NORTH TO LOWER 80S SOUTH. READINGS TONIGHT 
WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE MID 40S NORTH TO THE LOWER 50S SOUTH...AS 
SURFACE RIDGE PUSHES SOUTHWARD FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND 
ALLOWS CLOUDS TO BREAK UP. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE READINGS 
TANK TOWARD THE 40 DEGREE MARK IN SOME OF THE VALLEYS OF NORTHWEST 
AND NORTH CENTRAL ARKANSAS. 

500 MB RIDGE BUILDING OVER WEST/SOUTH TEXAS WILL SEND REMNANTS OF 
THE OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY BACK TO THE NORTH ON THURSDAY. RETURN FLOW 
WILL SET UP...THUS TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT WARMER ON THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY FRIDAY 
MORNING...AS INITIAL WAVE OF MOISTURE AND UPPER SUPPORT HEAD 
NORTHEAST IN THE MEAN FLOW. BEST CHANCES WILL BE OVER NORTHWEST 
ARKANSAS...GENERALLY NORTH OF A WALDRON TO MOUNTAIN HOME LINE. THIS 
AREA WILL SEE THE BEST UPPER SUPPORT.

COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO ARKANSAS BY FRIDAY NIGHT. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AS THE 
SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS. SUCCESSIVE MODEL RUNS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN 
SPEEDING UP THIS FEATURE...WITH THE SYSTEM EXITING THE FORECAST AREA 
BY LATE SATURDAY. HAVE THUS TRENDED POPS DOWNWARD DURING THE DAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE AND ONLY SOME SUPERFICIAL 
CHANGES WILL BE NEEDED THIS EVENING. SURFACE BOUNDARY BECOMING VERY 
ILL DEFINED BUT APPEARS TO BE ACROSS SOUTHERN MISSOURI AT THIS TIME. 
VIRTUALLY NO MOISTURE ACCOMPANIES THIS BOUNDARY WITH ONLY MID TO 
HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS COMING IN FROM THE WEST TO DEAL WITH. CLOUDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK WAVE WHICH ALSO WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON OUR 
SENSIBLE WEATHER.

THE BOUNDARY...OR WHATS LEFT OF IT...WILL CRUISE THROUGH THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT. THE FEATURE WILL ONLY REINFORCE THE COOL AND DRY AIR 
CURRENTLY OVER THE REGION WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BACK IN BEHIND 
IT. CURRENT PACKAGE HAS NO PRECIP MENTIONED UNTIL THE FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY TIME FRAME AND THIS LOOKS SOLID.

ALL FORECAST PARAMETERS ON TARGET AND OVERNIGHT LOWS SHOULD BE 
OBTAINED. ONLY CHANGES WILL BE TO ADJUST/TWEAK THE GRIDS TO REFLECT 
CURRENT TRENDS AND TO CLEAN UP THE WORDING.

VERY DIFFICULT TO FIND FROM ANALYZING...BUT THIS IS THE BEST 
POSITION AS INDICATED BY INCREASING WINDS BEHIND THE SYSTEM AND THE 
50 AND 55 DEGREE ISODROSOTHERMS. FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE SOUTHWARD 
TODAY...REACHING THE NORTHERN FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT. 

FORECAST CROSS SECTIONS INDICATE A SEVERE LACK OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
WITH THE SYSTEM. HENCE...ONLY NOTICEABLE CHANGE IN CONDITIONS WILL 
BE INCREASED MID AND UPPER LEVEL CLOUD COVER...AND PERHAPS A 
REINFORCING SHOT OF DRY AIR ALREADY IN PLACE. THE SYSTEM WILL WASH 
OUT INVOF CENTRAL/SRN ARKANSAS BY LATE WEDNESDAY. 

RETURN FLOW WILL SET UP LATE THURSDAY AS SFC RDG OVER EASTERN UNITED 
STATES PROGRESSES EASTWARD. FAIRLY STRONG COLD FRONT DEVELOPING IN 
THE PLAINS WILL SLIDE EASTWARD JUST IN TIME FOR THE WEEKEND. RAIN 
CHANCES RETURN TO THE FORECAST AS EARLY AS FRIDAY AFTERNOON IN THE 
NORTHWEST...AS UPPER IMPULSE WILL MOVE ACROSS NWRN AR IN THE MEAN 
FLOW. 

AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES GO...MAV/MET/FWC ARE ALL IN FAIRLY DECENT

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
843 PM CDT MON SEP 27 2004

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS RIGHT ON TARGET AND NO UPDATES REQUIRED THIS 
EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE TO REMAIN IN CONTROL OVERNIGHT WITH ONLY A 
LITTLE CIRRUS MOVING THROUGH ON OCCASION. CURRENT TEMPERATURE TRENDS 
SUPPORT FORECASTED LOWS.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
SURFACE ANALYSIS THIS MORNING SIMILAR TO THOSE OF THE PAST COUPLE OF 
WEEKS...EXCEPT FOR TROPICAL CYCLONE JEANNE IN SOUTHERN GEORGIA. 
SURFACE HIGH WAS TO THE NORTH WITH A NORTHEAST GRADIENT ACROSS 
ARKANSAS. OUTER CIRCULATION AROUND JEANNE RESULTED IN SLIGHTLY 
STRONGER WINDS TODAY WITH SOME GUSTS IN THE EAST. THIS SHOULD RELAX 
SOME TONIGHT AS JEANNE MOVES TO THE NORTHEAST BUT SOME WIND SHOULD 
CONTINUE. SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR EXCEPT FOR SOME CIRRUS 
PASSING OVER THE AREA AHEAD OF A SHORT WAVE IN THE HIGH PLAINS. MINS 
SHOULD BE NEAR OR A LITTLE COOLER THAN THIS MORNING. THE TROF WILL 
APPROACH FROM THE WEST THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS BUT WILL WEAKEN. A 
COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST BUT THE BROAD 
CIRCULATION AROUND THE REMNANTS OF JEANNE AND WEAK SURFACE HIGH TO 
THE EAST WILL KEEP NORTHEAST WINDS IN THE AREA AND WILL RESULT IN 
LITTLE CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE INTO THE 
AREA MOSTLY UNNOTICED. THIS AND THE WEAKENING UPPER TROF MAY PROVIDE 
SOME CLOUDS BUT LIMITED MOISTURE AND LACK OF CONVERGENCE WILL KEEP 
CHANCES OF RAIN TOO LOW TO MENTION IN THE FORECAST. THERE MAY BE A 
WEAK COOLING TREND TO TEMPS AROUND MIDWEEK BUT LITTLE ELSE. 

MAIN WEATHER FEATURE IN THE EXTENDED IS THE RATHER STRONG COLD FRONT
EXPECTED TO REACH THE AREA OVER THE WEEKEND. RIDGING ALOFT WILL BE 
IN THE AREA LATE THIS WEEK WHICH WILL BE UNFAVORABLE FOR A CLEAN 
FRONTAL PASSAGE IN THE AREA. HOWEVER A RATHER STRONG TROF WILL 
TRANSLATE TO THE EAST ACROSS THE COUNTRY AND THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
TO DRIVE THE FRONT THROUGH THE AREA. MODELS IN DISAGREEMENT ON 
TIMING AND STRENGTH OF THIS TROF. THE NEW GFS BRINGS A STRONGER TROF 
ACROSS AND BRINGS THE FRONT THROUGH THE AREA FASTER WITH MOST 
EVERYTHING PAST THE AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT. BUT OTHER MODELS SLOWLY 
BRING THE FRONT INTO THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND HANG IT AROUND INTO 
MONDAY WITH THE UPPER TROF NOT MOVING THROUGH UNTIL THEN. AM 
INCLINED TO GO WITH THE SLOWER SOLUTION AT THIS TIME AS THAT IS MORE 
FAVORED CLIMATOLOGICALLY. THUS KEPT SOME POPS IN FROM LATE FRIDAY 
THROUGH EARLY MONDAY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES IN TEMPS.

MONDAY AND TUESDAY WILL BE MILD AND DRY...AS HIGH PRESSURE HOLDS

FETCH OF HIGHER LVL MOISTURE CONTS TO STREAM NEWD ACRS ERN AR ATTM.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MRNG WITH OVERALL FCST TRENDS FOR 
THE SHORT TERM. WEAK RDG OF HIGH PRES WILL PERSIST OVER AR THE NEXT 
FEW DAYS AS REMNANTS OF JEANNE WORK N-NEWD OVER THE SERN AND 
MID-ATLANTIC STATES. PERSISTENT NELY WIND FLOW AT THE SFC WILL ALLOW 
FOR CONTD DRYING AND LTL CHC FOR RAINFALL.

INTO AR STARTING TUE. STILL LOOKS LIKE SIG MOISTURE AND CONVERGENCE 
WILL BE LACKING FOR ANY ORGANIZED PRECIP...SO HAVE LEFT FCST DRY PER 
GOING FCST. EXPECT TEMPS TO BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER FOR HIGHS AND

NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD. 

BY THURSDAY...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE EASTERN 
PORTION OF THE COUNTRY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR RETURN FLOW TO SET UP 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THOUGH UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN NEAR THE GULF 
COAST...IT WILL SINK SOUTHWARD A LITTLE. FLOW WILL BECOME MORE ZONAL 
IN NATURE...AND WILL ALLOW FOR A SURFACE FRONT TO MOVE DOWN FROM THE

HAIRS TO GET DETAILED ON DAY 7...BUT IF THE LONG RANGE GFS IS ANY 
INDICATION...THE FRONT COULD HANG UP OVER THE FORECAST AREA...
BRINGING THE FIRST SIGNIFICANT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THE FALL SEASON.

FORECAST ALREADY UPDATED EARLIER THIS EVENING BUT A LITTLE MORE

ADJUSTMENTS TO SKY FORECAST. CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGES SHOW SKIES 
HAVE CLEARED OUT JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 
SOUTHEAST. DEEP LAYERED MOISTURE CONTINUES TO BE SHUNTED SOUTHWARD 
AS DRIER AIR ADVECTS IN FROM THE NORTH. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS 
PLACES 60 DEGREE ISODROSOTHERM ROUGHLY FROM KFYV TO KSRC TO KHKA. 
QUICK PEAK AT THE NEW MODELS SHOWS IT SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH THROUGH 
THE NIGHT. 

NEXT CONCERN WILL BE FOG FORMATION. MODELS NOT REALLY HINTING AT IT 
WITH TEMP/DEW POINT SPREADS ABOVE 3 DEGREES MOST OF THE NIGHT AND 
THE AFOREMENTIONED DRIER AIR COMING IN. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO 
SEE A LITTLE FOG IN THE FAVORED AREAS INITIALLY BUT CONFIDENCE IS 
NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IT IN THE GRIDS/ZONES.

OVERNIGHT LOWS APPEAR REASONABLE AND WILL BE LEFT ALONE BUT WILL 
ADJUST THE GRIDS A BIT TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS. WILL ALSO ADJUST 
SKY GRIDS/ZONES FOR SUNDAY AS MODELS SHOWING THE AREA UNDER 
SUBSIDENCE FROM THE LATEST HURRICANE MOVING THROUGH THE EASTERN

SOUTHEAST OF THE STATE...WITH THE DRIER DEWPOINTS STILL ALONG THE 
MISSOURI BORDER. THE DRIER AIR WILL MOVE SOUTH TONIGHT AND 
SUNDAY...ENDING PRECIP CHANCES BEFORE MIDNIGHT. 

FORECAST REMAINS DRY THROUGH THE SHORT TERM...AS HIGH PRESSURE 
SETTLES IN. ANOTHER FRONT FROM THE PLAINS LOOKS TO MOVE IN 
TUESDAY...BUT MODELS HANDLING SITUATION DIFFERENTLY. GFS SHOWING A 
MORE PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WITH A STRONG SHORTWAVE. AM HAVING A HARD 
TIME BITING ON THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE...GIVEN WINDS WILL BE FROM THE 
NORTHEAST AS HURRICANE JEANNE IS TO THE EAST OF THE MID SOUTH. FOR 
NOW...LEFT PRECIP OUT...BUT TRENDED TEMPS DOWN SLIGHTLY FOR TUESDAY.

SURFACE HIGH TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST OF THE AREA WILL KEEP LIGHT 
NORTHEAST WINDS IN THE AREA THROUGH THE MIDDLE AND LATTER PART OF 
THE WEEK. GFS SHOWS INCREASED MOISTURE TO THE WEST OF THE AREA AND 
THIS LOOKS LIKE UPSLOPE EFFECTS WHICH SHOULD STAY WEST OF THE CWA. 
THUS KEPT DRY FORECAST WITH MINS A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL AND MAXES 
CLOSE TO NORMAL. GFS BRINGS A RATHER STRONG COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA 
NEXT SATURDAY BUT THE UPPER FLOW PATTERN IS NOT FAVORABLE FOR A 
FRONTAL PASSAGE AS AN UPPER RIDGE REMAINS IN THE AREA AND FLOW ALOFT 
IS MOSTLY FROM THE SOUTHWEST. COMPROMISED THE POSSIBILITIES FOR 
NOW...PUT IN SOME POPS FOR NEXT SATURDAY WITH THE HIGHEST IN THE 
NORTH. DID GO WITH LOWER MAXES BUT THIS MAINLY FOR INCREASED CLOUDS.

UPDATE WILL BE NEEDED THIS EVENING. COLD FRONT ILL DEFINED AT BEST 
THIS EVENING WITH WIND ANALYSIS PLACING IT SOMEWHERE OVER THE EAST 
BUT MOISTURE ANALYSIS WOULD PLACE IT OVER THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF 
THE STATE. PRESSURE CHANGE WOULD INDICATE THE FRONT OVER THE EAST 
WITH MOISTURE LAGGING BEHIND. REGARDLESS...FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO 
WEAKEN WITH TIME AS IT SAGS THROUGH THE STATE OVERNIGHT.

WSR-88D CONTINUES TO SHOW SCATTERED RETURNS OVER A LARGE AREA OF THE 
CWA WITH A GENERAL DRIFT TO THE NORTHEAST. MAIN BULK OF THE PRECIP 
SEEMS TO BE TIED INTO A MID LEVEL SHORTWAVE THAT WEAKENS WITH TIME. 
QUICK LOOK AT THE MODELS KEEP ABUNDANT MOISTURE AND PRECIPITATION 
IN PLACE THROUGH THE NIGHT. 00Z KLZK SOUNDING IS HINTING AT SOME 
DRYING IN THE LOW LEVELS SO PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL NOT BE VERY HIGH.

WILL NOT TOUCH THE POPS AND KEEP CURRENT TREND OF DECREASING THEM 
THROUGH THE NIGHT. CHANGE HERE WILL BE TO REMOVE ALL MENTION OF 
THUNDER WITH NO STRIKES IN THE CWA OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS.

OTHER CHANGE WILL BE TO TEMPERATURES...CURRENT TRENDS DO NOT SUPPORT 
FORECASTED LOWS. WITH ABUNDANT CLOUD COVER IN PLACE ...FAIRLY LOW 
TEMP/DEW POINT SPREADS AND CURRENT READINGS...WILL NEED TO BOOST 
LOWS ACROSS THE BOARD.

UPDATE OUT SHORTLY.

SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE WESTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EXTREME WEST. 
MOISTURE BEING PULLED INTO THE STATE FROM THE REMNANTS OF HURRICANE 
IVAN...AND INTERACTING WITH A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT. 
ALSO...SHORTWAVES OFF OF THE CIRCULATION OF IVAN ARE MOVING NORTH 
AND HELPING TO GENERATE SHOWERS. WITH ALL THESE FACTORS BEING IN 
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO THE AREA...HAVE CONTINUED THE CHANCE POPS 
TONIGHT...ALONG WITH ISOLATED THUNDER. FOR NOW...HAVE ONLY LIGHT 
AMOUNTS IN FOR QPF...BUT IF ENOUGH MOISTURE GETS PULLED 
NORTH...SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS COULD SEE AN INCREASE IN PRECIP RATES.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE STATE 
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. HIGHEST COVERAGE OF RAINFALL WILL BE RIGHT 
ALONG THE BOUNDARY...SO HAVE HIGHEST POPS WEST OF A LINE FROM 
TEXARKANA TO BATESVILLE. SATURDAY THE AXIS SHIFTS SOUTH...AS DRIER 
AIR MOVES IN FROM THE NORTH. HAVE RAINFALL ENDING IN THE NORTH 
SATURDAY MORNING...BUT LINGERING IN THE SOUTH UNTIL SATURDAY EVENING.

TEMPS TODAY WERE HELD IN CHECK DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND RAINFALL...BUT 
THINK SATURDAY WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER DUE TO LESS CLOUD COVER. BY 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY...HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE 
STATE...WITH TEMPS NEAR NORMAL.

HAVE SEEN SCTD PATCHES OF MOSTLY LIGHT RAIN AFFECT THE SERN HALF OF

FURTHER N WHERE THE AIRMASS IS SOMEWHAT DRIER. REMNANTS OF IVAN WERE 
CENTERED ALONG THE GULF COAST NEAR THE TX/LA BRDR. MEANWHILE...WEAK 
CDFNT WAS LOCATED ROUGHLY ALONG THE I-44 CORRIDOR JUST TO THE NW OF 
AR.

MAIN FCST CONCERN FOR THE EARLY PART OF THE FCST PD IS RAIN CHCS. 
MODELS STILL ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH LARGE SCALE FEATURES OVER 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS. WHAT IS LEFT OF IVAN IS PROGGED TO DRIFT WWD AND 
THEN SWWD INTO SERN TX. THE WEAK CDFNT IS FCST TO DRIFT SLOLY SEWD 
INTO AR INTO THE WEEKEND. 

STILL LOOKS LIKE SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE WITH IVAN WILL INTERACT WITH 
THE FNT TO KEEP RAIN CHCS IN THE FCST THRU SAT. SEVERAL WEAK UPPER 
LVL IMPULSES ARE ALSO FCST TO LIFT NEWD ACRS AR OVER THE NEXT 24 TO 
48 HRS. THUS...HAVE GONE WITH CHC POPS FOR NOW WHICH AGREES WELL 
WITH GOING FCST.

BY SUN AND MON...THE FNTL BNDRY WILL BE ABSORBED BY THE FLOW ARND 
HURCN JEANNE AS IT TRACKS ALONG THE COAST OF THE SERN US. WEAK SFC

MINOR UPDATE NEEDED THIS EVENING. ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE TO SCATTERED 
POPS IN THE FORECAST TONIGHT AND BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS...APPEAR TO 
BE RIGHT ON TRACK. TROPICAL STORM IVAN ON SHORE NOW OVER SOUTHERN 
LOUISIANA AND WHAT CONVECTION THERE WAS...SEEMS TO BE RAPIDLY 
DETERIORATING. BAND OF RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEATURE OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE AREA MOVING TO THE NORTHEAST. MOST OF THE 
PRECIP IS ALOFT AS SURFACE OBS ARE SHOWING MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION 
NOT MAKING IT TO THE SURFACE. BAND ACTUALLY APPEARS TO BE DECREASING 
SOMEWHAT AS IT MOVES INTO DRIER AIR.

COLD FRONT NOW ENTERING THE EXTREME NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE STATE 
BASED ON SURFACE ANALYSIS. LOCAL RADARS CURRENTLY SHOW VIRTUALLY NO 
PRECIPITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE AS UPPER SUPPORT MOVES 
OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. 

QUICK PEAK AT THE LATEST MODELS SHOW ALMOST NO MEASURABLE 
PRECIPITATION OVER THE CWA TONIGHT. HOWEVER...WITH SO MUCH GOING ON 
WILL SIMPLY LEAVE POPS IN PLACE. BEST CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION MAY 
BE ALONG THE FRONT ITSELF BUT WILL LEFT MIDNIGHT CREW MADE FINAL 
DECISION. FORECASTED TEMPS AND WINDS LOOKS GOOD AND WILL ALSO BE 
LEFT IN PLACE.

ONLY CHANGES WILL BE TO CLEAN UP WORDING AND DO SOME TWEAKING TO THE 
GRIDS TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS. CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL FORECAST WILL 
BE NEGLIGIBLE.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
BIG QUESTION IS HOW FAR NORTHWARD ANY SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE FROM IVAN 
WILL MAKE IT. APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE HEAVIEST MOISTURE WILL REMAIN 
SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. MAY POSSIBLY SEE UP TO 1/2 
INCH OR SO OVER THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWESTERN AREAS OVER NEXT 24 HOURS 
OR SO. REST OF THE AREA WILL SEE LIGHTER AMOUNTS. HAVE CHANCE POPS 
INCREASING NORTHWESTWARD OVERNIGHT...THEN CONTINUE CHANCE POPS OVER 
THE AREA ON FRIDAY. POPS WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
CONTINUING DECREASING ON SATURDAY. COLD FRONT MOVING INTO 
NORTHWESTERN SECTIONS THIS EVENING...BUT WILL BE VERY SLOW IN MOVING 
ACROSS THE AREA OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THUS...ONLY A LITTLE 
OF THE COOLER AND DRIER AIR BEHIND IT WILL MAKE IT INTO THE AREA BY 
THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEKEND.

SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL BRING A FEW DISTURBANCES THROUGH THE 
STATE...BUT WITH DRY AIR...HAVE LEFT PRECIP CHANCES OUT. TEMPS WILL 
BE NEAR NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED.

PLAINS AND WEAKENS THE RIDGE TO THE EAST WHICH WILL ALSO BE MOVING 
TO THE EAST. THIS WILL HELP BRING A COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA TONIGHT
AND FRIDAY. IN ADDITION...THE REMNANTS OF IVAN HAVE REGENERATED INTO
A WEAK TROPICAL STORM IN THE NORTHERN GULF. MOISTURE FROM THIS LOOKS
LIKE IT WILL MOVE INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS TODAY AND SPREAD ACROSS
MUCH OF THE AREA TONIGHT IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 
DUE TO THIS...HAVE KEPT SMALL POPS IN THE SOUTHEAST STARTING AROUND 
NOON THEN SLOWLY INCREASE POPS DURING THE AFTERNOON IN CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN SECTIONS. INCREASED POPS FOR TONIGHT TO AT LEAST 30 PERCENT
IN ALL AREAS AS MOISTURE GETS PULLED NORTH AND THE COLD FRONT BEGINS
TO MOVE INTO THE AREA. RAISED POPS TO 50 PERCENT IN THE SOUTH WHERE
MORE TROPICAL MOISTURE WILL BE PRESENT. GFS INDICATES AREA OF HEAVY
RAIN IN THE SOUTH TONIGHT BUT THAT LOOKS A LITTLE SUSPECT CONSIDERING
HOW FAR IT IS FROM THE CENTER OF IVAN. DO THINK THE SOUTH WILL BE
IN FOR HEAVIER RAIN BUT THINK AMOUNTS GENERALLY WILL BE ONE HALF
INCH OR LESS. THE FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FRIDAY BUT WILL 
BE WEAKENING CONSIDERABLY FROM THE LOSS OF UPPER SUPPORT AS THE MAIN
SHORT WAVE DRIVING IT WILL BE SCOOTING OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. HOWEVER
THE CIRCULATION AROUND THE REMNANTS OF IVAN AND THE PERSISTENT 
SURFACE RIDGE WILL LIKELY BRING A GENERAL NORTHEAST TO EAST WIND TO
THE AREA AND MAKE THE FRONT HARDER TO DEFINE WITH TIME. WILL 
CONTINUE WITH POPS RANGING FROM 30 IN THE NORTH TO 50 IN THE SOUTH.
THE MOISTURE AXIS GETS SHUNTED SLOWLY TO THE SOUTHEAST LATE FRIDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY. THE MAIN TROF AXIS ALSO MOVES INTO SOUTHEASTERN 
ARKANSAS BY FRIDAY EVENING. WHAT IS LEFT OF IVAN MAY GET STRETCHED 
OUT ALONG THIS AXIS BUT IT SUGGESTS POPS SHOULD DECREASE FROM THE 
NORTHWEST LATE FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT. ENOUGH MOISTURE REMAINS
TO CONTINUE A MENTION OF RAIN IN THE SOUTHEAST INTO SATURDAY. 
HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE FINALLY PUSHES INTO THE AREA ENOUGH
BY SATURDAY NIGHT TO BRING MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS WHICH SHOULD 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK. WENT CLOSE TO
PERSISTENCE ON MAXES TODAY EXCEPT FOR THE SOUTH WHERE INCREASED 
CLOUDS AND RAIN CHANCES SHOULD HOLD TEMPS DOWN A LITTLE. WENT
LOWER WITH MAXES FRIDAY DUE TO EXPECTED MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS RIGHT ON TARGET AND NO CHANGES ARE NEEDED.  
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN PARKED OVER THE AREA TONIGHT WITH A COLD 
FRONT STRETCHING ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS. TROPICAL SYSTEM SLOWLY 
ORGANIZING IN THE GULF IS ACTUALLY WHATS LEFT OF HURRICANE IVAN. 
SYSTEM TRAVERSED THE EAST COAST OF THE COUNTRY ON THE EASTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH AND IS NOW BACK IN THE GULF. PROGS HAVE SYSTEM 
APPROACHING THE TEXAS COAST TOWARDS MORNING WITH DEEP MOISTURE 
SURGING BACK INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS.

WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY AS NO REAL TRIGGER IS SEEN FOR TONIGHT BUT 
TROPICAL MOISTURE EXPECTED TO INTERACT WITH APPROACHING FRONT FOR AT 
LEAST CHANCE POPS THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY PER GOING 
FORECAST. WILL TWEAK THE GRIDS A LITTLE TO REFLECT CURRENT 
CONDITIONS BUT TRENDS SUPPORT FORECASTED LOWS. 
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BRING DRY WEATHER TO THE REGION. THROUGH
THE 20TH...LZK HAD 3RD DRIEST SEPTEMBER ON RECORD. THAT MAY CHANGE.

HIGH WILL FLATTEN HEADING INTO WEEKEND. COLD FRONT IN THE 
PLAINS...WHICH HAS PRETTY MUCH STALLED...WILL BEGIN MOVING AGAIN. 
FRONT WILL ARRIVE IN NORTHWEST ARKANSAS LATE THURSDAY NIGHT.

UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WITH FRONT WILL HEAD WELL TO THE NORTH...WITH 
FRONT SLOWING ONCE AGAIN. FRONT WILL LINGER IN THE STATE FRIDAY 
BEFORE DEPARTING ON SATURDAY.

ASIDE FROM FRONT...SYSTEM IN THE GULF WILL HEAD TO THE NORTHWEST
TOWARD THE REGION. MOISTURE SURROUNDING THE SYSTEM WILL SURGE INTO
THE SOUTHEAST COUNTIES BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...WITH MOISTURE 
OVERSPREADING ARKANSAS THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.

WITH A FRONT IN THE AREA...AND WITH SOME TROPICAL MOISTURE IN 
PLACE...WENT AHEAD AND BOOSTED CHANCES FOR RAIN A BIT IN THE 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY TIME FRAME. THIS ESPECIALLY THE 
CASE IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE. A LITTLE HISTORY WILL PLAY 
IN THIS DECISION AS WELL. 

LOOKING BACK AT TOP 5 DRIEST SEPTEMBERS...4 OF THESE HAD RAIN DURING 
THE LAST WEEK OF THE MONTH. SOME OF THIS RAIN WAS SIGNIFICANT...WITH 
3 OF THESE YEARS PUSHED OUT OF THE TOP 10 LIST FOR DRIEST 
SEPTEMBERS. NOT THAT HISTORY WILL REPEAT ITSELF THIS YEAR...BUT 
INTERESTING ANYWAY.

ASSUMING FRONT EXITS TO START THE WEEK...WILL GO BACK TO A DRY 
WEATHER PATTERN. DRIER AIR BEHIND FRONT...WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER 
TEMPERATURES FELT MAINLY AT NIGHT. (46)          

BROAD AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVER THE GULF COAST STATES FOR 
THE EARLY PORTION OF NEXT WEEK. SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL BRING A FEW WEAK 
SHORTWAVES ACROSS THE STATE...BUT MOISTURE RETURN IS RELATIVELY 
SMALL. FOR NOW...HAVE A DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF NEXT 
WEEK...WITH TEMPS NEAR NORMAL.

HIGH BASED STRATOCUMULUS IN THE 5000 TO 6000 FOOT RANGE HAS DEVELOPED
IN MUCH OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS APPARENTLY IN RESPONSE TO
A WEAK SHORT WAVE ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER HIGH IN THE OHIO VALLEY.
UPDATED ZONES TO CHANGE TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES FOR TODAY. FIGURE
CLOUDS SHOULD SCATTER OUT WITH MIXING LATER THIS MORNING AND SHOULD
HAVE LITTLE IF ANY EFFECT ON TEMPS. 

.PREV DISCUSSION...
SURFACE RIDGE FROM THE EAST REMAINS IN THE AREA KEEPING DRY AIR IN
PLACE. THIS BEING AIDED BY THE STRONGEST UPPER RIDGE OF THE SEASON 
ACROSS THE AREA. THIS SHOULD GENERALLY CONTINUE UNTIL A COLD FRONT 
MANAGES TO REACH THE AREA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. AT THE 
SAME TIME AN UPPER LOW WILL MOVE WEST ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF OF
MEXICO AND SOME MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COULD MAKE IT INTO 
AT LEAST SOUTHERN ARKANSAS BY LATE THURSDAY. THE APPROACHING FRONT 
WILL BE PUSHED AROUND BY AN UPPER TROF THAT WILL LIFT TO THE 
NORTHEAST INTO THE UPPER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THIS TROUGH WILL 
WEAKEN THE RIDGE THAT HAS COVERED THE AREA. THE FRONT SHOULD WEAKEN
CONSIDERABLY BEFORE REACHING THE AREA HOWEVER AS THE BEST UPPER 
SUPPORT MOVES AWAY TO THE NORTHEAST AND THE UPPER RIDGE REMAINS IN
THE AREA THOUGH IN A WEAKENED STATE. LOW LEVEL FLOW REMAINS FROM THE
EAST SO THE GULF NEVER REALLY OPENS UP AND MOISTURE WILL STILL BE 
RATHER LIMITED. 

WILL GO CLOSE TO PERSISTENCE WITH THE FORECAST TODAY AND TONIGHT.
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE THURSDAY ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH FROM THE
UPPER LOW MOVING TO THE WEST. MAX TEMPS SHOULD STILL BE ABOUT THE
SAME AS THEY WILL BE TODAY. WILL INTRODUCE SMALL POPS THURSDAY
NIGHT AS THE FRONT APPROACHES. THE WEAKENED FRONT WILL MOVE INTO
THE STATE FRIDAY AND WILL MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS THE AREA. MOISTURE
WILL REMAIN THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT SO WILL CONTINUE THE SMALL POPS
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. GFS MOISTURE FIELDS SUGGEST CONTINUING
POPS INTO SATURDAY IN THE SOUTH BUT WILL HOLD OFF FOR NOW. THE
COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL LIKELY LAG WELL BEHIND THE FRONT AND
WILL NOT MAKE ITS PRESENCE FELT TOO MUCH. KEPT MINS IN THE MID 50S
TO LOWER 60S WITH MAXES IN THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S FOR THE 
WEEKEND. SURFACE HIGH TO THE NORTH SHOULD TAKE CONTROL OF THE 
WEATHER OVER THE WEEKEND AND CONTINUE INTO NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL
BRING A REPEAT OF THE RATHER DRY NORTHEAST SURFACE FLOW INTO 
THE AREA. KEPT THE FORECAST DRY THROUGH THE REST OF THE SEVEN DAY
PERIOD.

SINCE A FAIRLY DEEP TROUGH ACROSS THE ROCKIES AND A CORRESPONDING 
AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL RIDGE EXTENDS FROM MEXICO INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION...EXPECT LITTLE CHANGE IN THE FAIR WEATHER PATTERN OVER 
ARKANSAS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THE ATMOSPHERE REMAINS QUITE DRY 
WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S STATEWIDE. LATEST LZK SOUNDING REVEALS 
LITTLE OR NO MOISTURE ALL THE WAY UP TO BALLOON BURST. THE LATEST 
MODEL RUNS ARE NOW COMING MORE IN AGREEMENT WITH TIMING OF NEXT COLD 
FRONT WHICH WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST LATE THURSDAY. 
THE QPF AMOUNTS ARE STILL IN QUESTION...BUT AT THIS POINT WILL LEAN 
MORE TOWARDS THE LIGHT RAINFALL. WILL THEREFORE KEEP SMALL RAIN 
CHANCES WITH SMALL RAINFALL AMOUNTS LATE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH 
THE COLD FRONT PASSAGE. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT A DRY SPELL WILL 
CONTINUE TODAY THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY WITH SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL 
AFTERNOON HIGHS AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL LOWS MAINLY DUE TO THE DRY

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
SHORT TERM MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH REGARDS TO THE SURFACE 
FEATURES BUT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED IN THE UPPER PATTERN IN THE LATER 
PART OF THE PERIOD. ALL MODELS START OFF WITH THE TROF-RIDGE-TROF 
PATTERN ACROSS THE CONUS BUT DIVERGE AFTER ABOUT 48 HOURS. THE 
DIFFERENCES CONCERN THE WESTERN CONUS TROF. THE ETA SOLUTION BEGINS 
TO PINCH OFF AN UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT BASIN WHILE THE GFS 
MAINTAINS AN OPEN TROF. WHILE BOTH MODELS ARE SLOWER WITH THE 
OVERALL SOLUTION...THE ETA IS CONSIDERABLY SLOWER. GFS LOOKS TO BE 
MORE IN LINE WITH THE OTHER MODELS AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND IS 
THE PREFERRED SOLUTION THIS AFTERNOON.

HIGH PRESSURE ON BOTH THE SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL CONTINUE TO 
DOMINATE IN THE SHORT TERM. AIR MASS WILL BE QUITE DRY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY WITH DEW POINTS ONLY PROGGED TO BE IN THE 50S. LITTLE 
MOISTURE IN PLACE WILL ALLOW GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AT NIGHT AND 
COMFORTABLY COOL MORNING LOWS. DAYTIME HIGHS WILL STILL AVERAGE A 
FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. WENT WITH A BLEND OF MAV/FWC NUMBERS THIS 
AFTERNOON. LOTS OF SUNSHINE IN STORE THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS WELL.

COME THURSDAY...THE HIGH BEGINS TO MOVE OFF TO THE EAST AND THE 
AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH BEGINS TO APPROACH. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO MORE 
OF A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AND MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO CREEP BACK UP 
INTO THE AREA. MEANWHILE...WAVE GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE CIRCULATION 
UNDER THE RIDGE AND TRAVELS ALONG THE GULF COAST. DEEP MOISTURE 
REMAINS JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA WITH THIS FEATURE BUT WILL GO WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE COLD FRONT 
ASSOCIATED WITH APPROACHING TROUGH. FRONT APPEARS TO MOISTURE 
STARVED AND WITH NO REAL FORCING SEEN ONLY 20 PERCENT POPS ARE 
JUSTIFIED.
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY
THE LATEST MODEL RUNS INDICATE THAT THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BREAK 
DOWN SLOWLY BY 00Z SATURDAY...AND THUS ALLOWING A LOW OVER THE UPPER 
MID WEST TO PASS WELL TO THE NORTH. ON THE THE SURFACE...THE WEAK 
COLD FRONT WILL CROSS ARKANSAS ON FRIDAY...BRINGING A SLIGHT CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK IN 
BEHIND THE FRONT. THE AIR BEHIND THE COLD FRONT WILL BE ONLY 
SLIGHTLY DRIER AND RELATIVELY COOLER. TEMPERATURES WILL TREND CLOSER

ONLY OTHER CHANGE WILL BE TO KNOCK OFF A FEW DEGREES OFF THE

INTO THE AREA ON EAST TO NORTHEAST WINDS BUT TEMPERATURES ARE 
RUNNING A FEW DEGREES BEHIND THIS TIME YESTERDAY. IN ADDITION...12Z

ETA SOLUTION HAS COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE OTHER SHORT

BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT MODEL AND SEE NOW REASON TO VEER FROM IT 
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE OTHER MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH IT. THAT 
BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON WITH

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
ETA SOLUTION HAS COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE OTHER SHORT 
TERM MODELS AND NOW ALL ARE PRETTY MUCH ON THE SAME PAGE. GFS HAS 
BEEN THE MOST CONSISTENT MODEL AND SEE NOW REASON TO VEER FROM IT 
ESPECIALLY SINCE THE OTHER MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH IT. THAT

1045 AM CDT SAT SEP 18 2004

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS IN FINE SHAPE BUT SOME CHANGES WILL BE NEEDED 
TO MAKE THE GRIDS REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS. ELEVATED CONVECTION 
CONTINUES ACROSS CENTRAL MISSOURI. PRECIP UP THERE SEEMS TO BE ON 
THE WANE AS CLOUD TOPS WARM AND LOW LEVEL JET WEAKENS BUT IT IS 
STILL SLOW SINKING TOWARDS THE SOUTH. AIRMASS OVER THE CWA IS VERY 
DRY AND STABLE AND ACTIVITY WOULD HAVE A HARD TIME GETTING IN HERE. 
SOME DEBRIS CLOUDS FROM THE CONVECTION HAVE WORKED INTO THE NORTH 
BUT ARE DRYING UP AS SEEN ON THE SATELLITE IMAGERY. HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS OVER THE NORTH STILL POSSIBLE BUT CURRENT FORECAST/GRIDS HAVE 
THIS HANDLED. AIRMASS WILL HEAT RAPIDLY THIS MORNING AND FORECASTED 
HIGHS LOOKS GOOD.

ONLY CHANGES WILL BE TO LOWER DEW POINTS. OBSERVED CONDITIONS HAVE 
BEEN RUNNING ABOUT 5 TO 7 DEGREES BELOW WHAT IS IN THE FORECAST 
GRIDS. WITH MODELS SHOWING AIRMASS DRYING OUT MORE WITH TIME WILL 
NEED TO ADJUST. CONSEQUENT LOWERING OF DEW POINTS WILL CHANGE 
HUMIDITY...HEAT INDEX AND GRAPHICAL FORECASTS AS WELL. FIRE WEATHER 
FORECAST WILL ALSO HAVE TO ADDRESSED.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
IR SATELLITE IMAGERY AND LOCAL RADARS CONTINUE TO INDICATE THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION ACROSS NORTHWEST MISSOURI. HIGH CLOUDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONVECTION WILL AFFECT NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE 
CWA THIS MORNING. 

ANIMATED IMAGERY FROM THE WATER VAPOR CHANNEL CLEARLY REVEALS THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF AN AMPLIFIED PATTERN ACROSS NORTH AMERICA. UPPER 
RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS WILL SPREAD NORTHEAST 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN DOMINANT OVER 
THE STATE DURING THE SHORT TERM.  OVERALL CONDITIONS WILL REMAIN 
DRY...WITH A SLIGHT COOLING TREND. 55

MODELS ARE NOT AS AGGRESSIVE WITH THE RETURN OF UPPER LOW FROM THE 
EAST AROUND THE STRONG RIDGE. THIS WILL KEEP THE DRIER/COOLER AIR 
OVER THE STATE A BIT LONGER BEFORE MOISTURE RETURNS ON THE BACK SIDE 
OF THE HIGH. THE SURFACE HIGH GAINS STRENGTH AS THE UPPER RIDGE 
AMPLIFIES. THIS WILL KEEP MOISTURE FARTHER SOUTH...ALONG THE GULF 
COAST. LOW ALOFT OVER THE INTER MOUNTAIN REGION MOVES EAST AND LIFTS 
AS IT GETS CAUGHT UP IN THE WESTERLIES. THERE SEEMS TO BE TOO MUCH 
BREAKING DOWN OF THE RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY 
SINCE THE LOW IS LIFTING. THE FORECAST WILL HOLD OFF ON THE RAIN FOR 
WEDNESDAY...WHILE KEEPING SMALL POPS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL HAVE A WIDE DIURNAL RANGE AS LONG AS THE 
DRY AIR STAYS IN PLACE. A SMALLER DIURNAL SPREAD WILL RETURN AS 
MOISTURE INCREASES AT THE LOWER LEVELS. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE 80S AND 
LOWS WILL BE MAINLY IN THE 60S...WITH A FEW 50S POSSIBLE IN THE 
NORTH. 32

221 PM CDT FRI SEP 17 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE SHORT TERM WITH ONLY MINOR 
DIFFERENCES OF NOTE. LARGEST DIFFERENCE IS THE PLACEMENT OF WHATS 
LEFT OF IVAN AFTER H48. ETA SOLUTION KEEPS A CLOSED LOW OFF CAPE 
HATTERAS WHILE THE GFS IS MORE OF AN OPEN WAVE NEAR CAPE FEAR. WHILE 
BOTH MODELS HAVE MOVED THE CENTER FURTHER SOUTH VERSUS PREVIOUS 
RUNS...THE ETA HAS MOVED IT CONSIDERABLY FURTHER SOUTH VERSUS ITS 
EARLIER POSITION. THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF 
SOLUTIONS THROUGH H48 THEN LEAN MORE TOWARDS THE MORE CONSISTENT GFS 
AFTER THAT POINT.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES SURFACE BOUNDARY RIGHT ALONG THE 
LOUISIANA/ARKANSAS BORDER WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE MID 
SOUTH. REMNANTS OF IVAN STRADDLING THE VIRGINIA/NC BORDER WITH 
DRIER AIR AND WIDESPREAD SUBSIDENCE IN PLACE OVER THE MID SOUTH. 
EVEN CU ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GOING UP IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. DEW 
POINTS HAVE DROPPED INTO THE MID 50S ACROSS THE NORTH. ALL MODELS 
SGENERALLY PROGGED TO BE IN THE 50S. LITTLE MOISTURE IN PLACE WILL 
ALLOW GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AT NIGHT AND COMFORTABLY COOL MORNING 
LOWS. DAYTIME HIGHS WILL STILL AVERAGE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. 
WENT WITH A BLEND OF MAV/FWC NUMBERS THIS AFTERNOON. LOTS OF 
SUNSHINE IN STORE THROUGHTUESDAY AS WELL.

MODELS ALL ADVERTISING THE UPPER PATTERN BEING PROGRESSIVE AND 
BECOMING HIGHLY AMPLIFIED. MASSIVE HEIGHT FALLS ALONG THE WEST COAST 
RESULT IN A VERY DEEP TROUGH BEING CARVED OUT. A LARGE RIDGE PUMPS 
UP IN RESPONSE OVER THE NATIONS MID SECTION BY LATE SATURDAY WITH 
MORE TROUGHING OVER THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE COUNTRY. REMNANTS OF

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE SHORT TERM WITH ONLY MINOR 
DIFFERENCES OF NOTE. LARGEST DIFFERENCE IS THE PLACEMENT OF WHATS 
LEFT OF IVAN AFTER H48. ETA SOLUTION KEEPS A CLOSED LOW OFF CAPE 
HATTERAS WHILE THE GFS IS MORE OF AN OPEN WAVE NEAR CAPE FEAR. WHILE 
BOTH MODELS HAVE MOVED THE CENTER FURTHER SOUTH VERSUS PREVIOUS 
RUNS...THE ETA HAS MOVED IT CONSIDERABLY FURTHER SOUTH VERSUS ITS 
EARLIER POSITION. THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF 
SOLUTIONS THROUGH H48 THEN LEAN MORE TOWARDS THE MORE CONSISTENT GFS 
AFTER THAT POINT.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES SURFACE BOUNDARY RIGHT ALONG THE 
LOUISIANA/ARKANSAS BORDER WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE MID 
SOUTH. REMNANTS OF IVAN STRADDLING THE VIRGINIA/NC BORDER WITH 
DRIER AIR AND WIDESPREAD SUBSIDENCE IN PLACE OVER THE MID SOUTH. 
EVEN CU ARE HAVING A HARD TIME GOING UP IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. DEW 
POINTS HAVE DROPPED INTO THE MID 50S ACROSS THE NORTH. ALL MODELS 
SGENERALLY PROGGED TO BE IN THE 50S. LITTLE MOISTURE IN PLACE WILL 
ALLOW GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AT NIGHT AND COMFORTABLY COOL MORNING 
LOWS. DAYTIME HIGHS WILL STILL AVERAGE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. 
WENT WITH A BLEND OF MAV/FWC NUMBERS THIS AFTERNOON. LOTS OF 
SUNSHINE IN STORE THROUGHTUESDAY AS WELL.

MODELS ALL ADVERTISING THE UPPER PATTERN BEING PROGRESSIVE AND 
BECOMING HIGHLY AMPLIFIED. MASSIVE HEIGHT FALLS ALONG THE WEST COAST 
RESULT IN A VERY DEEP TROUGH BEING CARVED OUT. A LARGE RIDGE PUMPS 
UP IN RESPONSE OVER THE NATIONS MID SECTION BY LATE SATURDAY WITH 
MORE TROUGHING OVER THE NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE COUNTRY. REMNANTS OF 
IVAN PROGGED TO GET CAUGHT UP IN THE CLOCKWISE FLOW AROUND THE RIDGE

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS RIGHT ON TARGET AND NO CHANGES ARE REQUIRED 
THIS MORNING. LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACE SURFACE BOUNDARY RIGHT 
ALONG THE LOUISIANA/ARKANSAS BORDER WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO 
THE MID SOUTH. REMNANTS OF IVAN CONTINUE TO MOVE ALONG THE SPINE OF 
THE APPALACHIANS WITH DRIER AIR AND WIDESPREAD SUBSIDENCE IN PLACE. 
DEW POINTS HAVE DROPPED INTO THE MID 50S ACROSS THE NORTH AND AIR 
MASS SHOULD CONTINUE TO DRY OUT THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
HAVE NO PROBLEMS REACHING FORECASTED HIGHS. CONVECTION ACROSS 
EASTERN KANSAS MAY SPREAD SOME CIRRUS BLOW OFF OVER THE NORTH LATER 
BUT WILL TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH HERE. REMNANTS OF IVAN WILL 
COME BACK INTO PLAY NEXT BUT A VERY PLEASANT AFTERNOON IS ON TAP FOR 
THE CWA.

INTERESTING SITUATION WITH THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW AS THE TROPICAL 
SYSTEM MOVES EAST. RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD FROM THE SOUTHWEST TOWARD 
THE GREAT LAKES AS TROF DEEPENS IN THE NORTHWEST AND THE LOW MOVES 
TO THE MID ATLANTIC COAST BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. THEN...THE LOW 
PLUNGES SOUTH ALONG THE EAST COAST BY 00Z MONDAY. THAT IS WHEN IT 
BEGINS TO REGRESS TOWARD ARKANSAS...KNOCKING ON OUR DOORS FROM THE 
EAST BY 00Z TUESDAY. IN THE MEANTIME...THE SURFACE DRIES OUT AS 
RIDGE BUILDS SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES. THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE 
PUSHES TROPICAL MOISTURE BACK TOWARD ARKANSAS WHILE THE RIDGE 
ORIENTS ITSELF MORE FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST. IN ESSENCE...THE 
FORECAST WILL BE A DRY ONE IN THE SHORT TERM...WITH THE POSSIBILITY 
OF RAIN RETURNING IN THE LONG RANGE. MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES WILL 
REMAIN IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S IN LIGHT OF THE DRY AIR THAT 
WILL PREVAIL UNDER THE STRONG RIDGE. MIN TEMPERATURES WILL BE THE 
MAIN BENEFICIARIES OF THE RIDGE SINCE THE DRY AIR WILL RADIATE 
BETTER OVERNIGHT. LOWS WILL BE RATHER PLEASANT IN THE UPPER 50S TO 
LOWER 60S.

LATEST GFS INDICATING THAT THE REMNANTS OF IVAN WILL BEGIN TO 
RETROGRADE SOUTHWESTWARD EARLY NEXT WEEK AS HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES 
SOUTHWESTWARD FROM THE GREAT LAKES. MOISTURE IS BROUGHT BACK INTO 
ARKANSAS STARTING MONDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUING TUESDAY. HAVE 
INTRODUCED SMALL POPS LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND THROUGH THE DAY ON 
TUESDAY. MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY...BUT NEW COLD 
FRONT WILL BRING SMALL CHANCES OF RAINFALL AGAIN ON THURSDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR OR A LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL. &&

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPED ACROSS THE WESTERN FRINGES 
OF THE CWFA THIS AFTERNOON AS NOTED ON KLZK RADAR. SATELLITE IMAGES 
CONTINUE TO SHOW TROPICAL STORM IVAN MOVING NORTH THROUGH ALABAMA 
WITH ASSOCIATED CLOUD COVER EXTENDING INTO EASTERN ARKANSAS. THE 
COLD FRONT IS NOW LOCATED NEAR THE MISSOURI BORDER AND EXTENDS 
THROUGH EASTERN OKLAHOMA. THE FRONT HAS MOVED VERY LITTLE TODAY. 
WILL EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY NEAR THE FRONT THROUGH 
EARLY THIS EVENING THEN DISSIPATE. WINDS IN THE SOUTHEAST WILL 
DISSIPATE THROUGH THE EVENING AS IVAN CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY. 
THEREFORE HAVE CANCELLED THE LAKE WIND ADVISORY THAT WAS IN EFFECT 
FOR THIS EVENING. 

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE MOVEMENT OF AN UPPER RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE. THIS HIGH WILL BUILD INTO ARKANSAS ON FRIDAY AND 
STRENGTHEN THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND WASH OUT THE COLD FRONT. CROSS 
SECTIONS SHOW VERY DRY AIR MOVING INTO THE AREA FRIDAY MORNING. THIS 
WILL KEEP PRECIP FROM DEVELOPING THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. AFTER THIS EVENING...WILL KEEP A DRY FORECAST THROUGH 
MONDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
NORMAL. 
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE ON THE SAME PAGE THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE 
OVERALL EVOLUTION OF THE PATTERN. THERE ARE SOME TIMING AND STRENGTH 
DIFFERENCES IN THE MODELS BUT OVERALL THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT AND 
CONTINUITY BETWEEN THEM. THAT BEING SAID...FEEL A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS 
IS WARRANTED. OVERALL DRY PATTERN LOOKS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE 
PERIOD.

PERIOD BEGINS WITH A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED PATTERN OF DEEP TROUGHING OVER 
THE ROCKIES AND STRONG RIDGING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
GFS MODEL HAS BEEN NOTORIOUS WITH KEEPING REMNANTS OF IVAN TRAPPED 
UNDER THE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND NOW IT APPEARS IT 
MAY HAVE BEEN RIGHT ALL ALONG. REMNANTS JUST SORT OF WOBBLE AROUND 
THE SOUTHEAST CONUS FOR A WHILE BEFORE WHATS LEFT DISSIPATES WITH NO 
REAL IMPACT ON OUR SENSIBLE WEATHER. TROF THEN BEGINS TO SHEAR OUT 
WITH AN UPPER LEVEL LOW CUTTING OFF OVER THE FOUR CORNERS AND RACES 
OFF TO THE NORTHEAST.

RETURN FLOW WILL RETURN WITH A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN MOISTURE. 
LATEST RUNS SLOWING UP ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EVEN MORE AND FEATURE 
NOW NOT EXPECTED TO APPROACH THE AREA UNTIL LATE WEDNESDAY AS IT 
RUNS INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED RIDGE AND SLOWS DOWN. MOISTURE DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO BE PLENTIFUL ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY MORE THAN SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS AT THIS TIME BUT I WILL PUSH THEM BACK TO DAY SEVEN.

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO RUN A FEW DEGREES ABOVE SEASONABLE 
WITH THE RIDGE DOMINATING. CURRENT MEX GUIDANCE SUPPORTS THIS 
SCENARIO AND IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED. DEW POINT TEMPS STILL PROGGED TO 
BE IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S SO OVERALL HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL NOT 
BE TERRIBLE.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY
HURRICANE IVAN MADE LANDFALL IN THE VICINITY OF GULF SHORES AL ABOUT
0645Z BY SATELLITE IMAGES AND IS MOVING INLAND. MAIN INFLUENCE IS 
STAYING TO THE EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BUT THE OVERALL CIRCULATION
AROUND IVAN SHOULD COVER ARKANSAS TODAY AND PRODUCE NORTHEAST WINDS.
A COLD FRONT IS MOVING TOWARD THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF ARKANSAS THIS
MORNING AND IT WILL LIKELY BE ABSORBED INTO THE BROAD CIRCULATION 
AROUND IVAN AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. THERE IS NOT A LOT OF COOLING OR
DRYING WITH THIS FRONT ANYMORE SO THERE LIKELY WILL NOT BE MUCH 
EFFECT ON TEMPS AND DEW POINTS. SOME THUNDERSTORMS HAVE CONTINUED ALONG
AND BEHIND THE FRONT DURING THE NIGHT AND THIS BAND OF MOISTURE IS 
PROGEED TO MOVE INTO ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS GOING ACROSS THE AREA TODAY 
DUE TO THESE THUNDERSTORMS. THE INTERACTION OF THIS WITH THE 
CIRCULATION AND SUBSIDENCE AROUND IVAN WILL LIKELY SUPRESS THIS
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY LATER TODAY. WILL LOWER POPS IN THE NORTHWEST
LATER TODAY AND DROP MENTION OF RAIN AFTER THE TODAY PERIOD. THE WINDS
AROUND IVAN ALONG WITH THE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FROM THE PLAINS
WILL RESULT IN GUSTY NORTHEAST WINDS WITH THE HIGHEST WINDS IN THE 
SOUTHEAST. THE TIGHTEST GRADIENT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL STAY TO THE EAST
OF THE AREA...BUT COULD SEE WINDS REACH LAKE WIND CRITERIA IN PARTS
OF THE EAST AND SOUTHEAST. ALSO LOOKS LIKE WINDS WILL DIMINISH WITH
LOSS OF HEATING AND DAYLIGHT...SO LAKE WIND ADVISORY CONDITIONS WILL
LIKELY END BY EARLY TONIGHT. CUT DOWN LAKE WIND ADVISORY TO INCLUDE
SEVERAL EASTERN AND SOUTHEASTERN COUNTIES AND ENDED ADVISORY AT 
MIDNIGHT...WHICH MAY STILL BE TOO LONG. AFTER ALL THIS...UPPER RIDGING
WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA WITH A SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDING INTO 
ARKANSAS FROM THE NORTHEAST. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN MOSTLY CLEAR TO
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH LIGHT NORTHEAST WINDS FROM FRIDAY THROUGH 
SUNDAY. FIGURE ON CLOUDS...WINDS AND THE DECAYING FRONTAL SYSTEM 
WILL TAKE A COUPLE OF DEGREES OFF MAXES TODAY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. 
AFTER THAT...PATTERN SHOULD FAVOR MINS CLOSE TO NORMAL AND MAXES A 
LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
SHOWERS CONTINUE TO BE ISOLATED ACROSS THE WEST SECTIONS OF THE CWFA 
AS SEEN ON THE KLZK RADAR. SATELLITE IMAGES CONTINUE TO SHOW 
ABUNDANT CUMULUS ACROSS THE AREA. BETTER LIFT IS BEING NOTED IN 
NORTHWEST ARKANSAS AS THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE PLAINS. THE 
COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO STRETCH FROM IOWA INTO OKLAHOMA AND ARKANSAS 
IS SQUEEZED BETWEEN THE FRONT AND APPROACHING HURRICANE IVAN.  

THE COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO NORTHWEST ARKANSAS THURSDAY 
MORNING. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE 
ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT. HURRICANE IVAN WILL MAKE LANDFALL NEAR 
MOBILE BAY THURSDAY MORNING. GFS IS CONSISTENT WITH THE NORTHEAST 
TRACK OF IVAN AFTER MAKING LANDFALL. AS IVAN MOVES NORTH THE 
PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN AND WINDS WILL INCREASE ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS EASTERN ARKANSAS. WILL ISSUE A LAKE WIND ADVISORY FOR SOUTH 
AND EAST SECTIONS OF THE CWFA. WINDY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AS IVAN SLOWLY MOVES NORTHEAST. WILL CONTINUE 
WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EAST 
THROUGH THURSDAY EVENING. IVAN WILL PULL AWAY FROM ARKANSAS ON 
FRIDAY...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL RELAX AND WINDS WILL DECREASE. 

DRY AIR MOVES IN FOR FRIDAY AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES

MODELS REMAIN IN GOOD AGREEMENT OVERALL WITH THE PATTERN REMAINING

SOME TIMING AND STRENGTH DIFFERENCES BUT OVERALL THERE IS GOOD 
CONTINUITY. THAT BEING SAID...FEEL A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS IS WARRANTED 
WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY MORE CONSISTENT ECMWF.

PERIOD BEGINS WITH A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED PATTERN OF DEEP TROUGHING OVER 
THE ROCKIES AND STRONG RIDGING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
GFS MODEL HAS BEEN NOTORIOUS WITH KEEPING REMNANTS OF IVAN TRAPPED 
UNDER THE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. PREFER THE OTHER 
MODELS HERE THAT WHISK THE REMNANTS OFF TO THE WEST. UPPER RIDGING 
WILL DOMINATE OVER THE AREA WITH THE TROF WEAKENING AS IT HEADS EAST 
WITH A CUT OFF LOW BEING PINCHED OFF IN ITS BASE. RETURN FLOW WILL
RETURN THROUGH TUESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE. ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT BUT LIKELY WILL NOT IMPACT 
THE AREA UNTIL WEDNESDAY AS IT RUNS INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED RIDGE 
AND SLOWS DOWN. MOISTURE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE PLENTIFUL ENOUGH TO 
JUSTIFY MORE THAN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AT THIS TIME.

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO RUN A FEW DEGREES ABOVE SEASONABLE 
WITH THE RIDGE DOMINATING. CURRENT MEX GUIDANCE SUPPORTS THIS 
SCENARIO AND IS GENERALLY ACCEPTED. DEW POINT TEMPS STILL PROGGED TO

305 AM CDT WED SEP 15 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY
UPPER TROUGH OVER NORTH TEXAS AND EASTERN OKLAHOMA CONTINUES TO 
GENERATE AREA OF SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THESE HAVE 
TRIED TO MOVE EAST INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS...BUT HAVENT MADE IT VERY 
FAR BEFORE DISSIPATING...THANKS TO MID LEVEL DRYING TAKING PLACE. 

THIS DRYING WILL BE SHORT LIVED...HOWEVER...AS SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL 
DRAW MORE MOISTURE INTO THE REGION TODAY. UPPER SYSTEM AND 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH WESTERN ARKANSAS TODAY...AS 
HURRICANE IVAN CONTINUES TO TRACK NORTHWARD TOWARD THE CENTRAL GULF 
COAST. ISOLATED/WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AS SEVERAL WAVES MOVE THROUGH THE APPROACHING TROUGH...AND 
COLD FRONT MOVES INTO NWRN ARKANSAS. 

WITH THE SURFACE SYSTEMS BOTH APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN UNITED 
STATES...BREEZY OR WINDY CONDITIONS WILL BE NOTED TOWARD THURSDAY 
MORNING...ON INTO FRIDAY AS GRADIENT TIGHTENS. MODELS CONTINUE TO 
TAKE IVAN ONTO THE CENTRAL GULF COAST...BUT THEN THEY SLOW THE 
SYSTEM DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. ETA BRING THE SYSTEM SLOWLY UP INTO 
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI BY THE END OF 60 HRS...WHEREAS THE GFS CURVES 
THE SYSTEM INTO NORTHERN ALABAMA...THEN STALLS IT OUT OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR SEVERAL DAYS...AND THEN EVEN HAS A SLIGHT 
RETROGRESSION BY MONDAY CANADIAN IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE GFS...
ALTHOUGH A BIT FASTER...AND ECMWF MORE RESEMBLES THE ETA. 

WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN THIS FORECAST...WILL TREND 
THE FORECAST WITH THE OFFICIAL NHC TRACK IN MIND...WHICH CARRIES THE 
SYSTEM INTO WESTERN ALABAMA AND THEN INTO EASTERN TENNESSEE BY 
MONDAY. ON THIS TRACK...THE PRIMARY EFFECT IVAN WILL HAVE ON THE 
FORECAST AREA WILL BE HEAVIER CLOUD COVER IN THE EAST AND INCREASED 
WINDS. 

BY FRIDAY...COLD FRONT...OR RATHER THE REMNANTS OF IT WILL LIKELY

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY
UPPER TROUGH OVER NORTH TEXAS AND EASTERN OKLAHOMA CONTINUES TO 
GENERATE AREA OF SHOWERS WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THESE HAVE 
TRIED TO MOVE EAST INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS...BUT HAVENT MADE IT VERY 
FAR BEFORE DISSIPATING...THANKS TO MID LEVEL DRYING TAKING PLACE. 

THIS DRYING WILL BE SHORT LIVED...HOWEVER...AS SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL 
DRAW MORE MOISTURE INTO THE REGION TODAY. UPPER SYSTEM AND 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH WESTERN ARKANSAS TODAY...AS 
HURRICANE IVAN CONTINUES TO TRACK NORTHWARD TOWARD THE CENTRAL GULF 
COAST. ISOLATED/WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AS SEVERAL WAVES MOVE THROUGH THE APPROACHING TROUGH...AND 
COLD FRONT MOVES INTO NWRN ARKANSAS. 

WITH THE SURFACE SYSTEMS BOTH APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN UNITED 
STATES...BREEZY OR WINDY CONDITIONS WILL BE NOTED TOWARD THURSDAY 
MORNING...ON INTO FRIDAY AS GRADIENT TIGHTENS. MODELS CONTINUE TO 
TAKE IVAN ONTO THE CENTRAL GULF COAST...BUT THEN THEY SLOW THE 
SYSTEM DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY. ETA BRING THE SYSTEM SLOWLY UP INTO 
CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI BY THE END OF 60 HRS...WHEREAS THE GFS CURVES 
THE SYSTEM INTO NORTHERN ALABAMA...THEN STALLS IT OUT OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR SEVERAL DAYS...AND THEN EVEN HAS A SLIGHT 
RETROGRESSION BY MONDAY CANADIAN IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE GFS...
ALTHOUGH A BIT FASTER...AND ECMWF MORE RESEMBLES THE ETA. 

WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTIES INVOLVED IN THIS FORECAST...WILL TREND 
THE FORECAST WITH THE OFFICIAL NHC TRACK IN MIND...WHICH CARRIES THE 
SYSTEM INTO WESTERN ALABAMA AND THEN INTO EASTERN TENNESSEE BY 
MONDAY. ON THIS TRACK...THE PRIMARY EFFECT IVAN WILL HAVE ON THE 
FORECAST AREA WILL BE HEAVIER CLOUD COVER IN THE EAST AND INCREASED 
WINDS. 

BY FRIDAY...COLD FRONT...OR RATHER THE REMNANTS OF IT WILL LIKELY 
GET ABSORBED IN THE CIRCULATION OF IVAN. UPPER RIDGE BUILDING 
NORTHEAST OUT OF TEXAS SHOULD GIVE THE SYSTEMS A PUSH FURTHER AWAY 
FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/MID SOUTH AREA. THUS...CLOUDS WILL

930 PM CDT TUE SEP 14 2004

A SHORT WAVE HAS BEEN TRIGGERING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER 
NEIGHBORING PARTS OF OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS. ALTHOUGH ECHOES HAVE BEEN 
DECREASING...THERE WILL BE A FEW SHOWERS SURVIVING INTO THE EXTREME 
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE STATE...SO A 20 PERCENT CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS SHOULD SUFFICE AFTER MIDNIGHT UNTIL SUNRISE. 32

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS...

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
ISOLATED SHOWERS WERE MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTH AND WEST THIS 
AFTERNOON. ALL SHOWERS HAVE DISSIPATED AT THIS TIME. SATELLITE 
IMAGES INDICATE QUITE A FEW CUMULUS ACROSS THE AREA. MOST CLOUDS 
WILL DISSIPATE AT SUNSET. 

BROAD TROUGH ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S. WILL FLATTEN OUT AS HURRICANE 
IVAN APPROACHES THE GULF COAST. GFS SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON 
THE SITUATION AT THIS TIME. A COLD FRONT IN THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL 
MOVE SOUTH AND WILL ENTER NORTHWEST ARKANSAS THURSDAY MORNING. WILL 
KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS GOING FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. WILL EXPECT WINDY CONDITIONS TO DEVELOP 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS IVAN MOVES EAST OF ARKANSAS. DRY AIR WILL 
MOVE INTO THE AREA FRIDAY AS AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST. 

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH SATURDAY. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON CONCERNING THE 
SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES WITH DIFFERENCES NOTED IN THE FINER DETAILS. 
WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS AFTERNOON WITH A 
LEAN TOWARDS THE MORE CONSISTENT ECMWF SOLUTION. GFS SEEMS A LITTLE 
OVERDONE WITH HOLDING ON TO WHATS LEFT OF IVAN OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
CONUS THROUGH THE ENTIRE PERIOD. 

PERIOD STARTS OFF WITH REMNANTS OF IVAN OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN 
MOUNTAINS AND A LARGE TROUGH STARTING TO DIG OVER THE WESTERN CONUS. 
TROUGH SHOULD WHISK IVAN OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. DIGGING TROUGH WILL 
RESULT IN RIDGING THAT IS ALREADY IN CONTROL WHEN THE PERIOD STARTS 
AND WILL BE REMAIN SO THROUGH OUT. AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH SWINGS INTO 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS LATE IN THE PERIOD WITH AN ACCOMPANYING COLD 
FRONT THAT EXTENDS FROM THE PARENT SURFACE LOW IN THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS TO NORTHERN NEW MEXICO. A SPRAWLING AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE  
CONTINUES TO PUSH BEHIND THE FRONT WITH MODELS CONTINUING TO WEAKEN 
THE BOUNDARY...MOVING THE BEST DYNAMICS OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. FRONT 
MAY BEGIN TO IMPACT THE NORTHWEST CORNER OF THE STATE LATE ON DAY 
SEVEN BUT WILL LEAVE THE CWA DRY FOR NOW.

RETURN FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THROUGH THE PERIOD FOR MORE 
OF A GRADUAL INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND CONSEQUENTLY CLOUD COVER AND 
HUMIDITY. MEX NUMBERS CONTINUING TO ADVERTISE TEMPERATURES NEAR 
NORMAL MINIMUMS AT NIGHT AND THREE TO FIVE DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY
SATELLITE PIC CURRENTLY INDICATES DEVELOPING STRATOCU OVER PORTIONS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. AIRMASS IS PRETTY WARM AT THE SURFACE...WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S AND TEMPS IN THE LOWER TO MID 
70S. ANOTHER WARM DAY IS IN STORE FOR THE FORECAST AREA...WITH HIGHS 
IN THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S. H5 FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUT OF THE 
SOUTHWEST...AND THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SEVERAL IMPULSES TO MOVE UP IN 
THE MEAN FLOW. THUS...COULD BE SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. 

COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE PLAINS TONIGHT. MOISTURE WILL 
INCREASE OUT AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. THE FRONT WILL ALLOW FOR A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. 

BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...IVAN COMES INTO PLAY. LATEST MODEL RUNS HAVE 
CONVERGED ON A LANDFALL NEAR THE MISSISSIPPI/ALABAMA COAST. THE 
TENDENCY HAS BEEN TO SHIFT THIS SLIGHTLY WESTWARD OVER THE LAST 
SEVERAL DAYS. AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS THAT THE PRIMARY EFFECT IVAN 
WILL HAVE ON ARKANSAS WILL BE INCREASED CLOUD COVER IN THE EASTERN 
HALF ALONG WITH BREEZY CONDITIONS ON THURSDAY. OF COURSE...IF THE 
TRACK OF THE STORM SHIFTS FURTHER WESTWARD...THERE WOULD BE MORE OF 
AN EFFECT...AND IF THE TRACK SHIFTS BACK TO THE EAST...THERE WILL BE 
LESS OF AN EFFECT ON OUR SENSIBLE WEATHER. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH...
THE PREDICTED PATH OF IVAN TOWARD THE GULF COAST IS EERILY CLOSE TO 
THE ONE CAMILLE TOOK BACK IN AUGUST 1969. 

BASED ON THE LATEST INFORMATION AVAIALABLE...WILL TREND CONDITIONS 
SLIGHTLY UPWARD FROM THE GOING FORECAST. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO 20 
AND 30 PERCENT...HOWEVER THE SOURCE FOR ANY RAINFALL OBSERVED WILL 
BE PRIMARILY FROM THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. WITH THE FORECAST AREA 
ON THE WEST SIDE OF IVAN...THE STORM WILL BE DRAWING IN DRIER 
CONTINENTAL AIR...LESSENING THE POTENTIAL FOR RAINFALL. ALSO...HAVE 
UPPED WINDS AND SKY COVER IN THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. 

COLD FRONT WILL GET CAUGHT UP IN IVANS CIRCULATION...AND BY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON...BOTH SYSTEMS WILL MOVE TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS AS AN H5 
RIDGE BUILDS NORTHEASTWARD OUT OF TEXAS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD 
INTO ARKANSAS ON FRIDAY...WITH DRIER AIR FILTERING IN. 

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL PATH OF HURRICANE IVAN...
PLEASE REFER TO PRODUCTS ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL HURRICANE 
CENTER. 
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
FORECAST WAS PREDICATED ON IVAN AND ITS REMNANTS MOVING NORTH AND

TPC FORECAST THROUGH 120 HOURS. BASED ON THAT...RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE SHOULD POKE ITS WAY INTO THE AREA BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND AND RIDGING ALOFT SHOULD 
OVERTAKE THE AREA. THAT SHOULD BRING MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND DRY 
WEATHER WITH MAXES A LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL AND MINS CLOSE TO NORMAL. 
UPPER RIDGING CONTINUES THROUGH MONDAY BUT A STRONG UPPER TROF 
DEVELOPS TO THE WEST WHICH RESULTS IN A RATHER STRONG FRONTAL SYSTEM 
DEVELOPING IN THE HIGH PLAINS. THIS WILL BRING INCREASING RETURN 
FLOW INTO THE AREA ABOUT SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE WHICH SHOULD MEAN AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND DEW POINTS. 
THIS IN TURN SHOULD RESULT IN HIGHER MINS.

302 AM CDT TUE SEP 14 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY
SATELLITE PIC CURRENTLY INDICATES DEVELOPING STRATOCU OVER PORTIONS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. AIRMASS IS PRETTY WARM AT THE SURFACE...WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S AND TEMPS IN THE LOWER TO MID 
70S. ANOTHER WARM DAY IS IN STORE FOR THE FORECAST AREA...WITH HIGHS 
IN THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S. H5 FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUT OF THE 
SOUTHWEST...AND THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SEVERAL IMPULSES TO MOVE UP IN 
THE MEAN FLOW. THUS...COULD BE SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. 

COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE PLAINS TONIGHT. MOISTURE WILL 
INCREASE OUT AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. THE FRONT WILL ALLOW FOR A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. 

BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...IVAN COMES INTO PLAY. LATEST MODEL RUNS HAVE 
CONVERGED ON A LANDFALL NEAR THE MISSISSIPPI/ALABAMA COAST. THE 
TENDENCY HAS BEEN TO SHIFT THIS SLIGHTLY WESTWARD OVER THE LAST 
SEVERAL DAYS. AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS THAT THE PRIMARY EFFECT IVAN 
WILL HAVE ON ARKANSAS WILL BE INCREASED CLOUD COVER IN THE EASTERN 
HALF ALONG WITH BREEZY CONDITIONS ON THURSDAY. OF COURSE...IF THE 
TRACK OF THE STORM SHIFTS FURTHER WESTWARD...THERE WOULD BE MORE OF 
AN EFFECT...AND IF THE TRACK SHIFTS BACK TO THE EAST...THERE WILL BE 
LESS OF AN EFFECT ON OUR SENSIBLE WEATHER. INTERESTINGLY ENOUGH...
THE PREDICTED PATH OF IVAN TOWARD THE GULF COAST IS EERILY CLOSE TO 
THE ONE CAMILLE TOOK BACK IN AUGUST 1969. 

BASED ON THE LATEST INFORMATION AVAIALABLE...WILL TREND CONDITIONS 
SLIGHTLY UPWARD FROM THE GOING FORECAST. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO 20 
AND 30 PERCENT...HOWEVER THE SOURCE FOR ANY RAINFALL OBSERVED WILL 
BE PRIMARILY FROM THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. WITH THE FORECAST AREA 
ON THE WEST SIDE OF IVAN...THE STORM WILL BE DRAWING IN DRIER 
CONTINENTAL AIR...LESSENING THE POTENTIAL FOR RAINFALL. ALSO...HAVE 
UPPED WINDS AND SKY COVER IN THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. 

COLD FRONT WILL GET CAUGHT UP IN IVANS CIRCULATION...AND BY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON...BOTH SYSTEMS WILL MOVE TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS AS AN H5 
RIDGE BUILDS NORTHEASTWARD OUT OF TEXAS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD 
INTO ARKANSAS ON FRIDAY...WITH DRIER AIR FILTERING IN. 

FOR MORE INFORMATION ON THE POTENTIAL PATH OF HURRICANE IVAN...
PLEASE REFER TO PRODUCTS ISSUED BY THE NATIONAL HURRICANE 
CENTER. 
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
FORECAST WAS PREDICATED ON IVAN AND ITS REMNANTS MOVING NORTH AND 
NORTHEASTWARD AWAY FROM THE AREA AS PROGGED BY THE GFS AND BY THE 
TPC FORECAST THROUGH 120 HOURS. BASED ON THAT...RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE SHOULD POKE ITS WAY INTO THE AREA BY FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND AND RIDGING ALOFT SHOULD 
OVERTAKE THE AREA. THAT SHOULD BRING MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND DRY 
WEATHER WITH MAXES A LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL AND MINS CLOSE TO NORMAL. 
UPPER RIDGING CONTINUES THROUGH MONDAY BUT A STRONG UPPER TROF

FEW SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS POPPED UP FROM CENTRAL INTO EASTERN 
ARKANSAS THIS AFTERNOON. PRECIPITATION SURROUNDING SYSTEM ALOFT IN 
WESTERN TENNESSEE. WILL KEEP ISOLATED PRECIPITATION IN FORECAST THIS 
EVENING...FOLLOWED BY CLEAR/PARTLY CLOUDY SKY. 

SYSTEM IN TENNESSEE WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ON TUESDAY...LEAVING 
ARKANSAS IN DRY WEATHER PATTERN ONCE AGAIN. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STILL 
FAIRLY HIGH...WITH HUMID CONDITIONS NOTED IN MAINLY THE SOUTHEAST 
HALF OF THE STATE. COULD BE SOME PATCHY LOW CLOUDS ONCE AGAIN TO 
START THE DAY.

HURRICANE IVAN WILL MAKE LANDFALL SOMETIME LATE WEDNESDAY ALONG 
CENTRAL GULF COAST. MEANWHILE...COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. REMNANTS OF IVAN WILL MOSTLY STAY EAST OF THE REGION... 
WITH PLENTY OF SUBSIDENCE IN ARKANSAS. THIS WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES 
LOW AS FRONT PUSHES INTO THE STATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY. BREEZY 
CONDITIONS MAY DEVELOP IN EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE STATE AS IVAN GOES 
BY ON THURSDAY.

AS IVAN DEPARTS AND FRONT EXITS TO THE EAST...WILL BE FOLLOWED BY 
ANOTHER SHOT OF DRY AIR LATE IN THE WEEK. THIS WILL LEAD TO COOLER 
NIGHTS AND LOWER AFTERNOON HUMIDITY LEVELS. 

TEMPERATURES...OVERALL...PRETTY CLOSE TO NORMAL THE NEXT 7 DAYS. 
NOTHING TO INDICATE THAT CURRENT DRY SPELL WILL END ANYTIME

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY
SHORT WAVE ALONG EASTERN EDGES OF CWA SET OFF SOME THUNDERSTORMS
IN EXTREME EASTERN PARTS OF THE CWA DURING THE NIGHT BUT THEY 
DISSIPATED SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE SLOWLY TO
THE EAST WHICH SUGGESTS CONVECTION WITH IT SHOULD STAY TO THE 
EAST OF THE AREA. SOME MOISTURE LINGERS IN THE EAST SO WILL 
HAVE POPS JUST BELOW THRESHOLD TO MENTION IN FORECAST IN THE 
EAST FOR MUCH OF THE DAY WITH POPS DECREASING TO THE WEST. 
OTHERWISE WINDS WILL BECOME MORE FROM THE SOUTH AS THE SURFACE RIDGE 
TO THE NORTHEAST WEAKENS. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN MAXES AT LEAST AS
HIGH AS SUNDAY AND MAYBE A DEGREE OR TWO HIGHER IN SOME PLACES. 
DRY AND WARM WEATHER SHOULD PREVAIL TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
WITH TEMPS NEAR PERSISTENCE. A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA
WEDNESDAY DRIVEN BY AN UPPER TROF MOVING ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST. 
AT THE SAME TIME...HURRICANE IVAN MAY BE APPROACHING THE GULF 
COAST...PROVIDED HE EVER MAKES THE TURN TO THE NORTH THAT HAS BEEN
FORECAST FOR SEVERAL DAYS. MOISTURE MAY INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA
DUE TO THIS SO WILL GO WITH MORE CLOUDS STARTING WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
MAXES WEDNESDAY SHOULD AGAIN BE IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S. 
THE FRONT SHOULD REACH INTO NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
BUT WILL LIKELY BE WEAKENING AS UPPER SUPPORT IS PULLING AWAY FROM
THE AREA. HOWEVER THE BROAD CIRCULATION AROUND IVAN MAY BRING NORTHEAST
WINDS TO THE CWA AND THE FRONTAL SYSTEM MAY GET ABSORBED INTO THE
SYSTEM AS WELL. WILL PUT IN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE NORTHWEST WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
AREA THURSDAY DUE TO THIS. WILL INCREASE CLOUDS SOMEWHAT AND THIS
SHOULD ALSO MODERATE HIGH TEMPS WITH MAXES THURSDAY A LITTLE LOWER. 
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
EXTENDED RANGE MODELS ARE NOW TRENDING THINGS SLOWER AND FURTHER 
WEST WITH HURRICANE IVAN. LOOKS AS THOUGH THERE COULD BE SOME 
INFLUENCE IN THE FORECAST AREA...MAINLY IN THE FORM OF INCREASED 
CLOUD COVER IN THE EASTERN HALF ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. OF 
COURSE...WHERE IVAN COMES ASHORE WILL MAKE A GREAT DEAL OF 
DIFFERENCE. IF IT MAKES LANDFALL FURTHER WEST...THERE WILL BE A 
GREATER EFFECT FOR OUR AREA. FOR NOW...FEEL THAT ONLY INCREASED 
CLOUDS WILL BE NOTED...AS WEST SIDE OF IVANS CIRCULATION DRAWS IN 
DRIER AIR AT THE LOWER LEVELS. 

BY LATE FRIDAY...RIDGE WILL BUILD NORTHEAST OUT OF TEXAS...PUSHING 
IVAN TOWARD APPALACHIA AND THE EAST COAST. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT 
WILL SET UP OVER ARKANSAS FOR THE WEEKEND. SEVERAL IMPULSES MAY MOVE 
DOWN IN THE MEAN FLOW...BUT AT THIS POINT MOISTURE AND UPPER SUPPORT

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY
SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTHEAST AND THIS

THIS WILL KEEP LIMITED MOISTURE IN THE AREA AS THE GULF STAYS 
CUT OFF. A WEAK SHORT WAVE OR TWO ALOFT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA
THROUGH SATURDAY BEFORE SETTLING INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. BUT
IT SHOULD DO LITTLE MORE THAN CAUSE A FEW CLOUDS. TEMPS WILL 
PROBABLY SHOW A SLOW WARMING TREND AND BE CLOSE TO OR A LITTLE ABOVE

.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
NO MAJOR CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE EXTENDED FORECAST. EXTENDED 
RANGE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MORNING...KEEPING DRY AIR 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE DURATION. LARGE H5 RIDGE EAST OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER WILL PRECLUDE ANY FORWARD MOVEMENT OF SYSTEMS IN

NOT A LOT GOING ON THIS GO AROUND. REMNANTS OF FRANCES MOVING INTO 
OHIO VALLEY...WITH FRONT HEADING EAST OF THE REGION. HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BUILD INTO THE PLAINS...WITH COOL NIGHTS/LOW AFTERNOON HUMIDITY 
LEVELS AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 

UNTIL HIGH ARRIVES...STILL A LITTLE BREEZY TODAY...BUT NOT AS MUCH 
AS ON TUESDAY WHEN FRANCES WAS A LITTLE CLOSER. 

LOOKING AHEAD...OVERALL PATTERN WILL CHANGE A BIT HEADING INTO THE 
WEEKEND. TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL DIG IN THE WESTERN UNITED 
STATES. THIS WILL CAUSE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO BUILD FARTHER 
EAST. TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY CLIMB UNDER THE RIDGE...WITH READINGS 
PRETTY CLOSE TO NORMAL BY THIS WEEKEND. HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL ALSO GO 
UP A LITTLE...WITH A FEW MORE CLOUDS POPPING UP DURING THE HEAT OF 
THE DAY. HOWEVER...NOTHING TO SUGGEST ANY PRECIPITATION...AND NONE 
ADDED TO THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME. (46)

RATHER NICE EVENING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. RIDGE HAS 
TAKEN HOLD OVER MUCH OF THE WESTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY...AND AS A 
RESULT...NORTHERLY TO NORTHEASTERLY FLOW CONTINUES TO BRING DRY AIR 
INTO THE AREA. JUST LOOK AT THOSE BEAUTIFUL 40 TO 50 DEGREE 
DEWPOINTS ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS. 

ONLY UPDATE TO TEXT FORECASTS THIS EVENING WAS TO CLEAN UP SOME 
TEMPORAL WORDING. OTHERWISE...WITH DRY AIR MAKING ITS WAY IN...AND 
CLEAR SKY OVER THE AREA...FORECASTED MINS IN THE LOWER 50S NORTH TO 
LOWER 60S SOUTH ARE CERTAINLY REASONABLE. 

HAVE ALSO ADJUSTED OTHER PARAMETERS...I.E. DEWPOINTS AND 
HUMIDITIES...TO BETTER ACCOUNT FOR ONGOING WEATHER TRENDS. UPDATE TO 
TEXT FORECASTS IS ALREADY OUT. UPDATED GRIDDED DATA AND GRAPHICAL 
FORECASTS WILL BE OUT VERY SHORTLY.

233 PM CDT TUE SEP 7 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO TRY TO MOVE INTO ARKANSAS FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. HOWEVER TROPICAL DEPRESSION FRANCES WILL HINDER THE 
PROGRESSION OF THE HIGH PRESSURE. CYCLONIC FLOW AROUND FRANCES 
CONTINUES TO BRING CLOUDS SOUTHWARD ACROSS EAST ARKANSAS AND ALONG 
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER. ALTHOUGH THE CLOUDS IN THE EAST HAVE 
DISSIPATED SOME...AS SEEN ON VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY...PARTLY 
CLOUDY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED IN THE SOUTHEAST TONIGHT. BREEZY 
CONDITIONS WILL DECREASE A BIT TONIGHT AND WINDS SHOULD NOT BE AS 
STRONG ON WEDNESDAY AS THE GRADIENT SLACKENS AS FRANCES EXITS THE 
AREA. 

AS FRANCES MOVES FURTHER NORTH ON WEDNESDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE 
ALLOWED TO MOVE INTO ARKANSAS. THE ETA HAS DONE WELL WITH HOLDING 
THE CLOUDS AND MOISTURE IN LONGER OVER THE EASTERN SECTIONS. THE 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT LATER IN THE PERIOD. THE HIGH PRESSURE 
AND MUCH DRIER AIR WILL BE THE RULE FOR THE REST OF THE 
WEEK...ELIMINATING THE CHANCES OF RAIN. THEREFORE THE FORECAST WILL 
BE DRY THROUGH SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN WARMING LATE IN THE 
WEEK AND TO BEGIN THE WEEKEND.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE 
OVERALL PROGRESSIVE FLOW. WILL SIMPLY GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS 
THIS AFTERNOON WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE MORE CONSISTENT AND SLIGHTLY 
FASTER GFS. PATTERN BEGINS WITH RATHER SIGNIFICANT H5 TROUGH 
APPROACHING THE WESTERN UNITED STATES WITH RIDGING OVER THE NATIONS 
MID SECTION. TROF MOVES EASTWARD WHICH IN TURNS PUMPS UP THE RIDGE 
OVER THE MOST OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. TROUGH LOOKS LIKE 
IT WILL BE FORCED UP AND OVER THE RIDGE WITH THE WESTERLIES 
REMAINING WELL NORTH OF THE CWA.

ON THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THE MAJORITY OF THE 
TIME WITH LITTLE IF ANY MOISTURE MOVING THROUGH. WITH ALL THE MODELS 
SHOWING NO SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVES...WILL CONTINUE THE DRY FORECAST 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. FLOW ALOFT LOOKS WEAK AND GULF APPEARS TO BE CUT 
OFF. WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE...WARM DAYS WITH TEMPERATURES AT OR 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL WILL PREVAIL WITH NIGHT TIME TEMPERATURES 
COMFORTABLY COOL. OVERALL HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL BE IN THE NON 
OPPRESSIVE CATEGORY.

WILD CARD IN ALL THIS WILL BE YET ANOTHER STRONG HURRICANE MOVING 
THROUGH THE WESTERN CARIBBEAN. THERE IS SOME DIFFERENCES IN EXACTLY 
WHERE IVAN WILL END UP WITH THE GFS CARRYING IT UP THE EAST COAST 
BUT OTHER MODELS SWING IT INTO THE EASTERN GULF BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
IMPACT ON THE CWA LOOKS MINIMAL RIGHT NOW BUT OF COURSE IVAN WILL 
BEAR WATCHING.

TODAY/TONIGHT. FRONT WILL WAIT FOR REMNANTS OF HURRICANE FRANCES TO

BEHIND THE FRONT...QUITE A FEW CLOUDS THIS MORNING IN CENTRAL AND 
EASTERN ARKANSAS. UNDER THE CLOUDS...SOME PATCHY RAIN NOTED EARLY

ROCK.

GIVEN THIS...WILL KEEP CLOUDS AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN IN 
CENTRAL/EASTERN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING. CLOUDS SHOULD ERODE THIS

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BEHIND THE FRONT TODAY. BETWEEN THE HIGH

139 PM CDT MON SEP  6 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH NO REAL DIFFERENCES 
SEEN. MODELS ARE CONSISTENT WITH CARRYING WHATS LEFT OF FRANCES OFF 
TO THE NORTHEAST AND SWEEPING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE STATE EARLY. 
THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS 
AFTERNOON. 

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES THE COLD FRONT ROUGHLY ALONG A SALEM 
TO CABOT TO MAGNOLIA LINE AND CRAWLING EASTWARD. LARGE AREA OF 
SHOWERS THAT WAS MOVING ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING HAS 
DISIPATED INTO MORE OF THE HIT AND MISS VARIETY AS THE FRONT RUNS 
INTO DRIER AIR AND LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE ON THE BACK SIDE OF WHATS 
LEFT OF HURRICANE FRANCES. MODELS ARE SLOW TO MOVE THE FRONT THROUGH 
OVERNIGHT. WITH SOME DECENT MOISTURE AND FORCING WILL KEEP SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS IN THIS EVENING OVER CENTRAL SECTIONS AND THROUGH EARLY 
MORNING OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNTIL THE FRONT FINALLY DOES CLEAR THE

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH NO REAL DIFFERENCES 
SEEN. MODELS ARE CONSISTENT WITH CARRYING WHATS LEFT OF FRANCES OFF 
TO THE NORTHEAST AND SWEEPING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE STATE EARLY. 
THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS 
AFTERNOON. 

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES THE COLD FRONT ROUGHLY ALONG A SALEM 
TO CABOT TO MAGNOLIA LINE AND CRAWLING EASTWARD. LARGE AREA OF 
SHOWERS THAT WAS MOVING ACROSS WESTERN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING HAS 
DISIPATED INTO MORE OF THE HIT AND MISS VARIETY AS THE FRONT RUNS 
INTO DRIER AIR AND LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE ON THE BACK SIDE OF WHATS 
LEFT OF HURRICANE FRANCES. MODELS ARE SLOW TO MOVE THE FRONT THROUGH 
OVERNIGHT. WITH SOME DECENT MOISTURE AND FORCING WILL KEEP SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS IN THIS EVENING OVER CENTRAL SECTIONS AND THROUGH EARLY 
MORNING OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNTIL THE FRONT FINALLY DOES CLEAR THE 
STATE.

GRADIENT TIGHTENS UP FOR TUESDAY AS STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO

BISECTING THE STATE FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST. FRONT WILL MOVE 
EASTWARD WITH TIME REST OF THE DAY BUT IT WILL BE SLOW GOING AS IT 
RUNS INTO THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS.

AREA OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO CRAWL TO THE 
EAST AND IS ACTUALLY DISSIPATING WITH TIME AND NOT MUCH PRECIP 
EXPECTED TO MAKE IT OVER TO THE SOUTHEAST PART OF THE STATE. CURRENT 
FORECAST HAS THIS PEGGED AND SPATIAL DISTRIBUTION OF POPS LOOKS 
RIGHT ON TARGET. CURRENT TEMPS AND WINDS ONLY NEED MINOR TWEAKING

OVERNIGHT IN THE WEST...WITH SCATTERED PRECIPITATION IN MOST AREAS 
ON MONDAY.

FRONT WILL BE HELD UP SOMEWHAT BY REMNANTS OF FRANCES...WHICH WILL 
HEAD INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES BY TUESDAY OR SO. FAIRLY 
STRONG HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND FRONT ALONG WITH CIRCULATION AROUND 
FRANCES WILL CREATE BREEZY NORTH/NORTHEAST WIND ACROSS ARKANSAS. 

SINCE ARKANSAS WILL BE EXPERIENCING QUITE A BIT OF SUBSIDENCE TO THE 
WEST OF FRANCES ON TUESDAY...ANY PRECIPITATION ALONG/NEAR FRONT WILL 
PRETTY MUCH DISSIPATE...WITH CHANCES FOR RAIN DROPPING. ALSO...AIR 
BEHIND THE FRONT QUITE DRY...AND WILL BE FILTERING INTO REGION. 

BY MIDWEEK...DRY AIR IN PLACE...WHICH WILL YIELD LOWER AFTERNOON 
HUMIDITY LEVELS AND SLIGHTLY COOLER NIGHTS. DAYTIME TEMPERATURES 
WILL REMAIN RATHER WARM...BUT PRETTY CLOSE TO NORMAL.

APPEARS THAT DRY WEATHER/CLOSE TO NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL HOLD INTO

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
BIGGEST WEATHER MAKER IN THE SHORT TERM WILL BE HURRICANE FRANCES IN 
THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. FRANCES WILL HAVE SOME IMPACT IN 
ARKANSAS...BUT THIS WILL BE MINOR. 

FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE OVER THE STATE TODAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. THIS WILL LEND ITSELF TO SOME CLOUDS AND 
ISOLATED/SCATTERED SHOWERS AND PERHAPS A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. DRY 
WEATHER IN THE FORECAST FARTHER NORTH. 

AS DAYTIME HEATING SUBSIDES THIS EVENING...SO WILL ANY 
PRECIPITATION. 

ON SUNDAY...COLD FRONT/WEAKENING TROUGH ALOFT WILL APPROACH FROM THE 
WEST. WENT AHEAD AND ADDED SLIGHT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS 
IN WESTERN ARKANSAS...WITH SOME RIDGING/DRY AND WARM WEATHER FARTHER 
EAST. 

REMNANTS OF FRANCES WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES 
MONDAY/TUESDAY. IT APPEARS THAT FRANCES WILL REMAIN FAR ENOUGH TO 
THE EAST TO KEEP MOST RAIN OUT OF THE FORECAST. HOWEVER... 
CIRCULATION AROUND REMNANTS WILL PRODUCE A BREEZY NORTH/NORTHEAST 
WIND. 

AS FAR AS THE FRONT TO THE WEST...IT MAY HEAD INTO STATE TO END THE 
SHORT TERM...BUT WILL LIKELY WASH OUT. PRECIPITATION WITH THE FRONT 
WILL BE HARD TO COME BY SINCE ARKANSAS WILL BE IN THE SUBSIDENCE 
AREA WEST OF FRANCES. 

OVERALL...TEMPERATURES PRETTY CLOSE TO NORMAL IN THE SHORT TERM. 
AFTERNOON READINGS WILL BE IN THE MID 80S/LOWER 90S...WITH 60S/LOWER 
70S AT NIGHT. (46)                  
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MORNING 
WITH REGARDS TO HURRICANE FRANCES BUT MODELS HAVE DONE A BIT ON AN 
ABOUT FACE REGARDING THE NEXT SYSTEM PROGGED TO COME IN LATE NEXT 
WEEK. PREVIOUS RUNS WERE ADVERTISING A COLD FRONT LATE IN THE 
PERIOD AND HAVE NOW BACKED OFF ON IT. BASED ON THE UPPER FLOW... 
FRONT WOULD HAVE A VERY TOUGH TIME GETTING IN HERE AT ALL. WITH SUCH 
A RATHER LARGE CHANGE...FEEL A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS IS IN 
ORDER.

PERIOD STARTS OFF WITH SLOWLY MOVING FRANCES OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
CONUS. WEAKENING SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE VIRTUALLY NO EFFECT ON THE CWA 
OTHER THAN SOME NORTHEAST BREEZES AS THE AREA WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN 
WIDESPREAD SUBSIDENCE. REMNANTS OF STORM ROCKET OFF TO THE NORTHEAST 
WHILE STRONG SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPS INTO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. 
WAVE CARVES OUT A TROUGH ALONG THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER AND IS TAKEN
INTO SOUTHERN ONTARIO BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. LAST NIGHTS MODELS 
WERE CONSIDERABLY STRONGER WITH THIS FEATURE AND DRAGGED A COLD 
FRONT ACROSS THE REGION FRIDAY BUT THIS SOLUTION IS NOT LOOKING 
FEASIBLE AT THIS TIME. 

MODELS NOW ADVERTISING BROAD RIDING FROM THE DESERT SOUTHWEST TO 
THE NEW ENGLAND STATES WITH THE GULF BASICALLY CLOSED FOR BUSINESS. 
PATTERN WOULD SUGGEST DRY CONDITIONS FOR DAYS FIVE THROUGH SEVEN AND 
AT THIS POINT...I SEE NO REASON TO ARGUE. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN 
IN THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S ACROSS THE CWA THROUGH THE PERIOD WHICH 
IS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT FORECAST PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK. MOST OF THE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST AREA HAS ENDED THIS EVENING. 
BUT...WITH FAIR MOISTURE TO THE SOUTH OF THE STATE...PLUS SOME 
LINGERING RAINFALL OVER NORTHERN LOUISIANA ON RADAR...WILL KEEP 
SMALL CHANCES OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS OVERNIGHT. TWEAKED 
TEMPERATURES AND WINDS SLIGHTLY. GRID AND TEXT UPDATES ALL OUT.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
UPPER LEVEL PATTERN KEEPS A WEAK SHORT WAVE OVER ARKANSAS TONIGHT 
MAINLY OVER THE SOUTHEAST HALF AND INTO SATURDAY. RIDGE BUILDS 
BRIEFLY OVER THE STATE FOR SUNDAY...BUT THE NEXT SHORT WAVE IN THE 
WESTERLIES IS NOT TOO FAR BEHIND. IT WILL AFFECT MAINLY THE 
NORTHWEST SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY OVER ALL SECTIONS. DRY MONDAY 
NIGHT. THERE WILL NOT BE A REALLY NOTICEABLE FRONTAL PASSAGE SINCE 
THE TROPICAL SYSTEM THE WILL APPROACH FROM THE SOUTHEAST WILL TURN 
OUR WINDS OUT OF THE NORTHEAST AND NORTH. FOLLOWED GFS TEMPERATURES.
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
LOOKS MORE LIKE FRANCES WILL STAY FAR ENOUGH EAST OF THE AREA TO HAVE
NO DIRECT EFFECTS ON THE WEATHER. A WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE
AREA IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TUESDAY WITH SOME MOISTURE INDICATED SO
PUT IN SMALL POPS FOR TUESDAY MOSTLY IN THE EAST. THIS MAY ALSO BE 
THE REMNANTS OF THE FRONTAL SYSTEM THAT MOVES INTO THE AREA LATER IN 
THE WEEKEND. LOOKS LIKE FRONT MAY BE ABSORBED INTO THE BROAD 
CIRCULATION AROUND FRANCES OR ITS REMNANTS BY LATE MONDAY OR 
TUESDAY. THERE LIKELY WILL BE LITTLE EFFECT ON TEMPERATURES AND
MINS MAY ACTUALLY GET HELD UP A LITTLE DUE TO HIGHER DEW POINTS
BEING THRUST INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTHEAST OR EAST. GFS WANTS
TO BRING A RATHER STRONG COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA BY NEXT FRIDAY.
UPPER PATTERN DOES NOT BECOME TOO FAVORABLE FOR A FRONTAL PASSAGE
IN ARKANSAS UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY SO THINK GFS IS A 
LITTLE FAST WITH THE FRONT. DID PUT IN CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE 
AREA FOR FRIDAY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE ON FRIDAY NIGHT. MADE
LITTLE CHANGE TO TEMPERATURES ON FRIDAY BUT DID BRING IN COOLER
AND DRIER AIR FRIDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
DEEP TROUGH IN THE ROCKIES...WITH RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
CENTRAL/EASTERN UNITED STATES TO START THE SHORT TERM. IN THE COMING 
DAYS...TROUGH WILL WEAKEN AS IT HEADS EAST...WITH RIDGE FLATTENING 
OUT. THIS WILL LEAVE PRETTY MUCH ZONAL FLOW ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
COUNTRY LATE IN THE WEEKEND/EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH NO SIGNIFICANT 
SYSTEMS TO MENTION. OF COURSE...THERE IS HURRICANE FRANCES...WHICH 
WILL BE MENTIONED LATER.

ANYWAY...AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE HEADING TO THE 
EAST...WITH A MORE SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW. MOISTURE WILL TEND TO 
INCREASE...AND ALREADY SEEING MORE CLOUDS OVER SOUTHEAST HALF OF 
STATE THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...WITH NOT MUCH TO TAP INTO THE 
MOISTURE...ONLY A FEW SPRINKLES/ISOLATED SHOWERS OCCURRING. 

NOT EXPECTING MUCH CHANGE THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH FAIR AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE/CLOUDS...BUT LITTLE IN THE WAY OF TRIGGERING MECHANISMS. AT 
BEST...SLIGHT CHANCES OF SHOWERS/MAYBE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IN 
FORECAST.

ONLY SIGNIFICANT WEATHER FEATURE WILL BE HURRICANE FRANCES...WITH
THE SYSTEM CLOSING IN ON FLORIDA THIS WEEKEND. SYSTEM PROGGED TO 
MOVE INTO SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH ARKANSAS 
IN SUBSIDENCE AREA TO WEST OF SYSTEM. THIS WILL FURTHER LEND TO A 
MOSTLY DRY PATTERN IN THE COMING DAYS. 

WILL BE A WEAK COLD FRONT CLOSING IN FROM THE NORTHWEST EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...BUT WILL NOT LIKELY AMOUNT TO MUCH AND WILL PROBABLY WASH OUT 
TO END THE SHORT TERM.
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT THIS MORNING 
REGARDING THE EVOLUTION AND TRACK OF HURRICANE FRANCIS. GFS SOLUTION 
LAST NIGHT WAS CARRYING THE SYSTEM UP THE COAST BUT HAS SHIFTED ITS 
THINKING AND NOW BRINGS IT ACROSS THE FLORIDA PENINSULA AND INTO THE
SOUTHEAST CONUS. GFS NOW IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH ALL OTHER MODELS 
SANS THE ECMWF WHICH CARRIES WHATS LEFT OF IT MUCH FURTHER WEST. 
THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS THIS 
MORNING.

PERIOD STARTS OFF WITH FRANCES OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS AND SHOULD 
HAVE VIRTUALLY NO EFFECT ON THE CWA OTHER THAN SOME NORTHEAST 
BREEZES AS THE AREA WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN WIDESPREAD SUBSIDENCE. 
OTHERWISE THE WESTERLIES ARE CONFINED TO THE NORTHERN TIER STATES IN 
A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW. THE REMNANTS OF THE HURRICANE WILL MOVE ALONG 
THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS WHILE STRONG SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPS 
IN THE THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. WAVE CARVES OUT AN UPPER LOW AND 
RATHER DEEP TROUGH OVER THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST WHICH THEN MOVES OFF 
TO THE NORTHEAST AND INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS BY THE END OF THE 
PERIOD. RESULT WILL BE A RETURN OF A RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS. 
PATTERN WOULD SUGGEST DRY CONDITIONS FOR DAYS FIVE THROUGH SEVEN AND 
AT THIS POINT...I SEE NO REASON TO ARGUE. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN 
IN THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S ACROSS THE CWA THROUGH THE PERIOD WHICH 
IS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

309 AM CDT THU SEP  2 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT THIS MORNING VERSUS LAST NIGHT AND ALL 
ARE IN ON THE SAME PAGE REGARDING THE EVOLUTION OF THE WESTERN 
CONUS SYSTEM. MODELS ARE ALSO CONSISTENT IN SLOWING DOWN THE 
APPROACHING SYSTEM SOMEWHAT WHICH WHEN LOOKING AT THE SOUTHEAST 
CONUS RIDGE...MAKES SENSE. WITH NO CLEAR CUT MODEL OF CHOICE.. I 
WILL CONTINUE TO GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL THIS MORNING BUT ITS 
INFLUENCE WILL BE STARTING TO WANE A BIT AS IT MOVES OFF TO THE 
EAST. UPPER FLOW STILL SHOWING A WEAKNESS OVER THE NATIONS MID 
SECTION. THIS DEFORMATION ZONE SHOWS SEVERAL WEAK WAVES EMBEDDED IN 
IT WHICH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS. 
HOWEVER...WITH VIRTUALLY NO MOISTURE TO WORK WITH...ONLY SCATTERED 
AFTERNOON CU ARE EXPECTED AS MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE SHOWING SOME 
MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER THE SURFACE RIDGE.

MEANWHILE...INTENSE UPPER LOW NOW LOCATED OVER EASTERN BRITISH 
COLUMBIA WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD CARVING OUT A DEEP TROUGH AS 
IT DOES. STRONG SHORTWAVE DIVING DOWN THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW IS 
AIDED BY A STRONG JET MAX AND SPINS UP A NEW UPPER LOW OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS WHILE THE INITIAL TROUGH SHEARS OUT. AS THE SYSTEM 
EVOLVES...SUB TROPICAL RIDGES STRENGTHENS OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES BY SATURDAY MORNING. INCREASED RIDGING IN TURN SLOWS UP THE 
FORWARD SPEED OF HURRICANE FRANCES WHICH SHOULD BE JUST OFF THE 
CENTRAL FLORIDA COAST BUT ALSO INTRODUCES MORE MOISTURE TO THE MID 
SOUTH AS FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE SOUTHWESTERLY.

SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS OVER NORTHEAST COLORADO SATURDAY MORNING AND 
RACES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST DURING THE DAY...REACHING NORTHERN 
MINNESOTA BY EARLY SUNDAY. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT STRETCHES ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO NORTHEAST TEXAS BY SUNDAY MORNING BUT WILL 
START TO BOG DOWN AS IT RUNS INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED SOUTHEAST CONUS 
RIDGE. CURRENT FORECAST IS CARRYING SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AND THIS APPEARS REASONABLE AS NO REAL FORCING OR 
SHORTWAVES ARE SEEN BUT SOME LIFT IS EVIDENT. MOISTURE WILL BE ON 
THE INCREASE SATURDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTHEAST. FRONT 
DOES APPEAR TO WEAKEN SOMEWHAT AS IT RUNS INTO THE RIDGE WITH WHAT 
DYNAMICS THAT ARE PRESENT...APPEARING TO BE PRE FRONTAL. FROPA 
ITSELF SHOULD BE SOMETIME MID TO LATE DAY SUNDAY OVER THE METRO AREA 
BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE LINGERS FOR A CONTINUATION OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING.

WITH HURRICANE FRANCES CRAWLING UP THE EAST COAST...AREA OF 
SUBSIDENCE BEGINS TO MOVE IN FROM THE NORTHWEST SUNDAY NIGHT. 
MOISTURE SHUNTED OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST DURING THE NIGHT BUT WILL 
LEAVE SOME SLIGHT CHANCES POPS IN EARLY SUNDAY NIGHT AND TAPER THEM 
OFF BY MONDAY MORNING.

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO RUN AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONABLE

309 AM CDT THU SEP  2 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT THIS MORNING VERSUS LAST NIGHT AND ALL 
ARE IN ON THE SAME PAGE REGARDING THE EVOLUTION OF THE WESTERN 
CONUS SYSTEM. MODELS ARE ALSO CONSISTENT IN SLOWING DOWN THE 
APPROACHING SYSTEM SOMEWHAT WHICH WHEN LOOKING AT THE SOUTHEAST 
CONUS RIDGE...MAKES SENSE. WITH NO CLEAR CUT MODEL OF CHOICE.. I 
WILL CONTINUE TO GO WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL THIS MORNING BUT ITS 
INFLUENCE WILL BE STARTING TO WANE A BIT AS IT MOVES OFF TO THE 
EAST. UPPER FLOW STILL SHOWING A WEAKNESS OVER THE NATIONS MID 
SECTION. THIS DEFORMATION ZONE SHOWS SEVERAL WEAK WAVES EMBEDDED IN 
IT WHICH WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS. 
HOWEVER...WITH VIRTUALLY NO MOISTURE TO WORK WITH...ONLY SCATTERED 
AFTERNOON CU ARE EXPECTED AS MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE SHOWING SOME 
MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER THE SURFACE RIDGE.

MEANWHILE...INTENSE UPPER LOW NOW LOCATED OVER EASTERN BRITISH 
COLUMBIA WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD CARVING OUT A DEEP TROUGH AS 
IT DOES. STRONG SHORTWAVE DIVING DOWN THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW IS 
AIDED BY A STRONG JET MAX AND SPINS UP A NEW UPPER LOW OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS WHILE THE INITIAL TROUGH SHEARS OUT. AS THE SYSTEM 
EVOLVES...SUB TROPICAL RIDGES STRENGTHENS OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES BY SATURDAY MORNING. INCREASED RIDGING IN TURN SLOWS UP THE 
FORWARD SPEED OF HURRICANE FRANCES WHICH SHOULD BE JUST OFF THE 
CENTRAL FLORIDA COAST BUT ALSO INTRODUCES MORE MOISTURE TO THE MID 
SOUTH AS FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE SOUTHWESTERLY.

SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS OVER NORTHEAST COLORADO SATURDAY MORNING AND 
RACES OFF TO THE NORTHEAST DURING THE DAY...REACHING NORTHERN 
MINNESOTA BY EARLY SUNDAY. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT STRETCHES ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO NORTHEAST TEXAS BY SUNDAY MORNING BUT WILL 
START TO BOG DOWN AS IT RUNS INTO THE AFOREMENTIONED SOUTHEAST CONUS 
RIDGE. CURRENT FORECAST IS CARRYING SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AND THIS APPEARS REASONABLE AS NO REAL FORCING OR 
SHORTWAVES ARE SEEN BUT SOME LIFT IS EVIDENT. MOISTURE WILL BE ON 
THE INCREASE SATURDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTHEAST. FRONT 
DOES APPEAR TO WEAKEN SOMEWHAT AS IT RUNS INTO THE RIDGE WITH WHAT 
DYNAMICS THAT ARE PRESENT...APPEARING TO BE PRE FRONTAL. FROPA 
ITSELF SHOULD BE SOMETIME MID TO LATE DAY SUNDAY OVER THE METRO AREA 
BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE LINGERS FOR A CONTINUATION OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING.

WITH HURRICANE FRANCES CRAWLING UP THE EAST COAST...AREA OF 
SUBSIDENCE BEGINS TO MOVE IN FROM THE NORTHWEST SUNDAY NIGHT. 
MOISTURE SHUNTED OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST DURING THE NIGHT BUT WILL 
LEAVE SOME SLIGHT CHANCES POPS IN EARLY SUNDAY NIGHT AND TAPER THEM 
OFF BY MONDAY MORNING.

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO RUN AT OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONABLE 
OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. DEW POINT TEMPERATURES SLOWLY CREEP UP 
THROUGH THE PERIOD FOR INCREASED HUMIDITY BUT WITH DEW POINT 
TEMPERATURES ONLY PROGGED TO PEG OUT IN THE LOWER 70S...CONDITIONS  
WILL NOT BE OVERLY OPPRESSIVE. DRIER AIR STARTS TO COME BACK IN 
AFTER FROPA. WENT WITH A BLEND OF FWC/MAV NUMBERS THIS MORNING.

AND A MAJOR SHIFT IN HER PATH WOULD OF COURSE ALTER WHAT WOULD 
HAPPEN OVER THE MID SOUTH. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FRANCES 
CAREFULLY OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

CU DEVELOPED ACROSS THE REGION AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON. DEW POINTS 
REMAIN FAIRLY COMFORTABLE ACROSS THE STATE...WITH MEASUREMENTS A FEW 
DEGREES EITHER SIDE OF 60. SFC HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM REMAINS CENTERED 
OVER EAST CENTRAL MO. EASTERLY WINDS WILL KEEP DEW POINTS DOWN FOR 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS. EXPECT CU TO SUBSIDE AFTER 6 PM. WILL BE CLEAR 
TONIGHT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS WESTERN AR.

IN THE SHORT TERM...INHERITED GRIDS LOOKED PRETTY GOOD. ONLY 
NOTICEABLE ADJUSTMENT WAS TO SLIGHTLY RAISE MAX TEMPS ON FRIDAY. 
FEEL THAT WITH HURRICANE FRANCES APPROACHING THE SE US COAST...WILL 
SEE SOME LARGE SCALE SUBSIDENCE OVER THE MID SOUTH. THIS...ALONG 
WITH THE RIDGE ALREADY IN PLACE...WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES FRIDAY TO 
GET JUST A BIT HIGHER THEN PREVIOUSLY FORECASTED.

BIGGEST CHANGES WERE MADE TO THE SATURDAY/SUNDAY TIME FRAME IN THE 
LONG RANGE. ALL MODELS ADVERTISING A STRONG H5 SHORTWAVE TO DROP OUT 
OF THE PACIFIC NW. LATEST GFS MODEL CARRIES THE LOW FURTHER 
NORTH...AND IS A BIT FASTER WITH IT. SFC LOW DEVELOPS AHEAD OF THE 
H5 LOW AND MOVES NE. A COLD FRONT GETS DRAGGED THROUGH AR...WITH 
FROPA APPEARING TO OCCUR SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

MOISTURE MAY BE AN ISSUE THOUGH. FEEL THAT WHILE SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL 
RETURN TO MUCH OF THE STATE...FURTHER SOUTH WINDS WILL NOT BE AS 
STRONG OUT OF THE GULF DUE TO WIND FIELDS BEING PERTURBED BY 
HURRICANE FRANCES. TIMING WILL ALSO BE TRICKY...AS H5 LOW MAY BE 
FASTER/SLOWER AND TREND EVEN FURTHER NORTH. WENT AHEAD AN INTRODUCED 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MOST OF SUNDAY.

UPPER LEVEL WINDS BECOME WESTERLY IN THE LATER PERIODS...BRINGING 
DRY AIR AGAIN TO THE REGION. LOOKS LIKE WE COULD BE IN STORE FOR 
ANOTHER PROLONGED PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER FOR NEXT WEEK...WITH 
TEMPERATURE REMAINING NEAR NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
THE MODELS...WHICH HAD BEEN QUITE CONSISTENT OF LATE...HAVE DONE AN 
ABOUT FACE THIS MORNING REGARDING THE EVOLUTION OF THE SIGNIFICANT 
WESTERN CONUS TROF. MODELS NOW ADVERTISING A MUCH STRONGER WAVE 
DROPPING ALONG THE BACKSIDE OF THE DEVELOPING TROF WITH A WEAKER 
SURFACE REFLECTION VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS.

MODELS ALSO TRENDING SLOWER WITH MOVING THE TROF THROUGH THE WESTERN 
UNITED STATES AND EVENTUALLY THE MID SOUTH. THIS SLOWER MOVEMENT 
ACTUALLY SEEMS REASONABLE BASED ON THE STRENGTH OF THE DOWNSTREAM 
RIDGE. REGARDLESS...FAITH IN ANY ONE MODEL IS LACKING AND A FEEL A 
COMPROMISE OF SOLUTIONS THIS MORNING IS WARRANTED. THERE ARE ALSO 
NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCES IN THE HANDLING OF A WEAKNESS UNDER THE BROAD
RIDGE OVER THE MID SOUTH BUT THE EFFECT ON OUR SENSIBLE WEATHER 
WILL BE MINIMAL.

PERIOD STARTS OF TRANQUIL WITH SURFACE RIDGE REMAINING IN CONTROL 
AND BROAD RIDGING OVER THE MAJORITY OF THE NATION SANS THE PACIFIC 
NORTHWEST. MODELS STILL SHOWING A WEAKNESS UNDERNEATH THE RIDGE OVER 
THE MID SOUTH BUT WITH LIMITED MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE DRY FORECAST. 
ONLY REAL IMPACT WILL BE AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER FOR BOTH 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. AFOREMENTIONED TROF REALLY STARTS TO DIG ON 
FRIDAY AS STRONG PIECE OF ENERGY SWINGS THROUGH ITS BASE. THIS IN 
TURN PUMPS UP THE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. MODELS NOW 
HAVE THE WAVE CLOSING OFF INTO AN UPPER LOW ON SATURDAY WITH TROF 
SHEARING OUT WHICH IS A NEW SOLUTION BEING OFFERED BY THE MODELS. 

SURFACE LOW AND ASSOCIATED FRONT NOW CONSIDERABLY WEAKER THAN 
PREVIOUS RUNS AND ALSO SLOWER. STRENGTHENING OF THE SOUTHEAST CONUS 
RIDGE WILL DELAY THE FRONTAL ARRIVAL UNTIL SUNDAY BUT MODELS ALSO 
INDICATING SYSTEM MAY WASH OUT BEFORE GETTING HERE AND JUST BE AN 
INVERTED TROF ONCE IT DOES. THERE IS A SUBSTANTIAL INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE FROM PREVIOUS RUNS BUT NOT SURE WHERE ALL THIS MOISTURE IS 
COMING FROM AS AREA WILL BE IN WEAK FLOW AND WEAK SUBSIDENCE WITH 
HURRICANE FRANCES APPROACHING THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA.

FOR NOW...WILL PULL PRECIP OUT UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT AND THEN ONLY GO 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCES POPS. ENTIRE FORECAST SUBJECT TO CHANGE 
DEPENDING UPON WHAT FRANCES DOES AND THE OVERALL EVOLUTION OF THE 
CUT OFF WESTERN LOW. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE VERY CLOSE TO 
SEASONAL NORMALS THROUGH THE PERIOD. DEW POINT TEMPERATURES HAVE 
TRENDED UP A FEW DEGREES VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS AS FLOW IS MORE 
SOUTHWEST ALOFT. HUMIDITY LEVELS SHOULD STILL REMAIN BELOW 
OPPRESSIVE BUT DEW POINTS WILL BE CREEPING UP TO 70 DEGREES AS THE 
WEEKEND NEARS. WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FWC/MAV NUMBERS THIS MORNING.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY ...
COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE STATE AND WILL BE IN THE SOUTHEAST 
CORNER OF ARKANSAS SUNDAY MORNING. MODELS SHOW ABUNDANT MOISTURE 
WITH THE SYSTEM BUT QUESTION THE ACCURACY OF THIS SCENARIO. IF 
HURRICANE FRANCIS MOVES INTO THE SOUTHEAST U.S. A NORTHEAST FLOW 
WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE AREA. SOME MOISTURE MAY MAKE IT INTO THE MID 
SOUTH BUT THIS SHOULD BE LIMITED GIVEN THE DISTANCE TO THE 
HURRICANE. THEREFORE...WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THROUGH 
SUNDAY MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA MONDAY AND 
BRING DRY CONDITIONS THROUGH TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE NEAR NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MORNING THROUGH 60 HOURS WITH NO 
MAJOR DIFFERENCES NOTED. MODELS START TO DIVERGE A BIT AFTER THAT 
WITH GFS A BIT FASTER AND STRONGER WITH THE APPROACHING H5 TROUGH 
AND THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. FASTER SPEED SEEMS MORE REASONABLE 
BASED ON OVERALL PROGRESSIVE NATURE TO THE PATTERN. WILL GO WITH A 
BLEND OF SOLUTIONS THROUGH 60 HOURS AND THEN LEAN TOWARDS THE GFS 
THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. 

BENIGN CONDITIONS IN PLACE TO ROUND OUT THE MONTH WILL NO REAL 
CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE PERIOD. THUNDERSTORMS TO THE 
WEST SPREADING SOME CIRRUS OVER THE AREA AT THIS TIME BUT NO REAL 
EFFECT ON THE SENSIBLE WEATHER EXPECTED.

SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM TEXAS ALL THE WAY INTO SOUTHERN QUEBEC 
AND REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY. MOISTURE 
REMAINS LIMITED THROUGH THAT TIME WITH THE GULF EFFECTIVELY CUT OFF. 
UPPER PATTERN IS CHARACTERIZED BY BROAD RIDGING ALOFT THAT IS 
EVENTUALLY SHUNTED EASTWARD LATE IN THE PERIOD BY A TROF DIGGING 
ACROSS THE NATIONS MID SECTION. ONLY POSSIBLE FLY IN THE OINTMENT IS 
A WEAKNESS IN THE FLOW THAT DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
THURSDAY MORNING. SHORTWAVE MOVES THROUGH THE STATE BUT WITH 
MOISTURE STILL SERIOUSLY LACKING WILL MAINTAIN THE DRY FORECAST.

LATER PART OF THE PERIOD STARTS TO GET INTERESTING WITH STRONG 
HURRICANE FRANCES APPROACHING THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA AND STRONG 
SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE PRAIRIE PROVINCES OF CANADA. LARGE TROF 
BEING CARVED OUT OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS BY SATURDAY MORNING WITH 
THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EXTENDING FROM THE OKLAHOMA PANHANDLE TO 
EASTERN KANSAS. 

TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO SEASONAL NORMALS AND WENT WITH A BLEND 
OF MAV/FWC NUMBERS THIS MORNING. MODELS CONTINUING THE TREND OF 
KEEPING RELATIVELY DRY AIR OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. WHILE 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARM...HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL BE HELD SOMEWHAT IN 
CHECK BY DEW POINT TEMPERATURES PROGGED TO REMAIN IN THE LOW TO MID 
60S.  
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...
A TROUGH ACROSS THE NATIONS MID SECTION IS APPARENT ON THE LATEST 
GFS RUN. A SURFACE COLD FRONT MOVES TO EASTERN KANSAS AND WESTERN 
OKLAHOMA BY SATURDAY MORNING. WITH THE APPROACHING FRONT AND 
SOUTHWEST SURFACE FLOW FEEDING MOISTURE BACK INTO THE AREA...WILL 
INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT. THE FRONT AND ASSOCIATED TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA 
SUNDAY. APPEARS AT THIS TIME THAT THE TROPICAL SYSTEM WILL BE PICKED 
UP BY THE UPPER TROUGH AND MOVE ALONG THE EAST COAST. 

HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR MOVES INTO THE ARKANSAS AREA ALONG WITH 
NORTHWEST FLOW SUNDAY. WILL NOT EXPECT PRECIP AT THIS TIME FOR 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WILL STAY CLOSE TO THE GFS TEMPERATURES AND

244 PM CDT MON AUG 30 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED TO BE SCARCE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE SHORT TERM PERIODS. THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES 
A RIDGE AXIS FROM SOUTHWEST OKLAHOMA THROUGH CENTRAL ILLINOIS.  A 
NEARLY STATIONARY BOUNDARY IS LOCATED WELL TO THE SOUTH ACROSS 
SOUTHERN LOUISIANA...INTO SOUTH CENTRAL TEXAS.

THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE IS FORECAST TO REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH 
THE SHORT TERM PERIODS...WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE A RELATIVELY DRY 
AIR MASS ACROSS THE REGION. 

&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH LABOR DAY...
ONLY A FEW CHANGES MADE TO THE LONG TERM GRIDS. FOLLOWED PREVIOUS 
FORECAST AND KEPT FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY DRY. A WEAK COLD FRONT LOOKS 
TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY...BUT NOT MUCH MOISTURE ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT. A BROAD TROUGH SETS UP OVER THE MIDWEST THIS WEEKEND...AND 
COULD AFFECT PLACEMENT OF HURRICANE FRANCIS. FOR NOW...ADDED SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR LABOR DAY AS A DISTURBANCE MOVES INTO THE BASE OF 
THE TROUGH...BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH.

.SHORT TERM...
THE SKY WAS CLEAR ACROSS MUCH OF ARKANSAS THIS MORNING WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING OVER THE AREA. SATELLITE IMAGES INDICATE ISOLATED 
LOW STRATUS CLOUDS MOVING WEST ACROSS SOME AREAS. THESE CLOUDS WILL 
DISSIPATE THIS MORNING. HIGH CLOUDS CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHEAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE CWFA. THESE CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE 
TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST. 

UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. WILL CONTINUE MOVING EAST. A 
LARGE RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN U.S. WILL SPREAD EASTWARD AND CONTINUE 
THE SUBSIDENCE OVER THE AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
KEEPING DRY AIR OVER THE AREA. MUCH DRIER AIR IS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE MID SOUTH NOW...AS SEEN WITH THE 
CURRENT DEW POINTS IN THE 50S AND 60S ACROSS THE AREA. DRY AIR WILL 
REMAIN IN PLACE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL NOT INCLUDE ANY POPS 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. 

WILL GO NEAR THE GFS TEMPERATURES. COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
ARE EXPECTED TODAY BUT A WARMING TREND WILL BE NOTED THROUGH THE 
WEEK. 
 
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
GFS MODEL HAS CHANGED ITS THINKING IN REGARDS TO TROPICAL SYSTEM 
THAT WILL BE APPROACHING THE EAST COAST OF THE CONUS LATE IN THE 
PERIOD. WILL GO WITH MORE OF A BLEND OF MODEL SOLUTIONS AS OPPOSED 
TO MORNINGS PAST BUT OVERALL...THE MODELS ARE STILL MAINTAINING A 
DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE PERIOD.

PERIOD STARTS OFF WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
A WEAK TROF OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. MEANWHILE...MORE SIGNIFICANT 
TROF STARTS TO DIG OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. ENSUING SOUTHWEST FLOW 
IS WEAK AND BEST MOISTURE RETURN REMAINS TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE 
AREA. MODELS ARE SHOWING SOME WEAK IMPULSES MOVING THROUGH THE FLOW 
BUT WITH LACK OF DYNAMICS...WE WOULD BE HARD PRESSED TO GET ANY 
PRECIP FROM THESE WAVES. FLOW DOES SHARPEN UP CONSIDERABLY ON 
SATURDAY AS AFOREMENTIONED TROF REALLY STARTS TO DIG INTO THE 
NATIONS MID SECTION. MODELS NOW PICKING UP ON A COLD FRONT THAT 
SWINGS THROUGH LATE SATURDAY. FRONT DOES HAVE SOME MOISTURE BUT NOT 
MUCH MORE SO ONLY CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED WITH ITS PASSAGE.

MODELS HAVE REALLY CHANGED THEIR THINKING OF TROPICAL SYSTEM THAT 
WILL BE OFF THE EAST COAST OF FLORIDA BY SATURDAY NIGHT. PREVIOUS 
RUNS WERE CARRYING SYSTEM INTO THE GULF COAST AFTER CROSSING THE 
FLORIDA PENINSULA. CURRENT RUN HAS THE SYSTEM BEING PICKED UP BY THE 
TROF IN THE NATIONS MID SECTION AND CARRYING IT UP THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD. PLACEMENT OF SYSTEM WOULD PRECLUDE ANY MENTION OF PRECIP 
ON SUNDAY AS WELL.

MEX NUMBERS LOOK RIGHT ON TRACK AND WILL BE FOLLOWED FAIRLY CLOSELY. 
DEW POINTS ADVERTISED TO STAY IN THE 60S THROUGH OUT THE PERIOD FOR 
NON OPPRESSIVE CONDITIONS. OF COURSE...ALL IS SUBJECT TO CHANGE IF 
TROPICAL SYSTEM DECIDES TO DO ITS OWN THING. A WARY EYE WILL REMAIN 
ON THE TROPICS FOR THE NEXT WEEK.

COOLER AND DRIER AIR OVERTAKING THE AREA AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED TO THE NORTH SHOULD COVER THE AREA THROUGH THE MIDDLE
OF THE WEEK. THIS SHOULD KEEP LIGHT NORTHEAST TO EAST FLOW AT LOW 
LEVELS AND LIMIT MOISTURE. UPPER TROF SLOWLY MOVES PAST THE AREA BY
MONDAY THEN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT CONTINUES. THERE STILL MAY BE A WEAK
SHORT WAVE IN THE FLOW MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY BUT PRESENT
INDICATIONS ARE IT SHOULD NOT SET OFF ANY PRECIPITATION. MOS MINS
RANGING FROM MID TO UPPER 50S IN THE NORTH TO LOWER 60S MOST OTHER
AREAS TONIGHT LOOK GOOD AND GENERALLY WENT WITH IT. ALSO WENT A
LITTLE COOLER AND WITH MOS FOR MAXES ON MONDAY. A SLOW MODERATION

ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR GOOD COOLING AGAIN MONDAY NIGHT.

PRESSURE MOVES EASTWARD...AND RETURN FLOW SETS UP. H5 TROUGH LOOKS 
TO TAKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF TIME MOVING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH FROM THE 
TEXAS PLAINS...WITH SEVERAL UPPER IMPULSES MOVING UP AROUND THE 
TROUGH IN THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. WHILE A SURFACE FOCUS WILL BE 
LACKING...CANNOT RULE OUT ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...AS THE SYSTEMS TRAVERSE THE 
FORECAST AREA AND AIR MASS WARMS UP. STRONG UPPER RIDGING WILL 
PRECLUDE ANY PROGRESSION OF SURFACE SYSTEMS...HOLDING A COLD FRONT 
AND SURFACE LOW OUT IN THE PLAINS FOR SEVERAL DAYS. 

FOR LATE DAY 6 AND DAY 7...PICTURE GETS MUCH LESS CLEAR. THE 
PRINCIPAL REASON FOR THIS WILL BE WHETHER OR NOT FRANCES HAS ANY 
INFLUENCE ON WEATHER OVER THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES. NOT 
SURPRISINGLY...LONG RANGE SOLUTIONS ARE NOT IN THE BEST AGREEMENT 
WITH REGARDS TO POSITION OF THE STORM BY SUNDAY. GFS HAS BEEN 
CONSISTENT THE LAST FEW DAYS BRINGING THE SYSTEM INTO THE GULF...
WITH EVENTUAL LANDFALL BETWEEN SRN MS AND WRN FLORIDA...WITH THE 
OTHER MODELS BRINGING THE SYSTEM ACROSS THE BAHAMAS. REGARDLESS...
WITH THE SYSTEM APPROACHING...FLOW ALOFT AND AT THE SURFACE WILL 
TURN MORE EASTERNLY AND NORTHEASTERLY...THEREFORE SHUTTING OFF 
AVAILABLE MOISTURE FROM THE GULF. THUS HAVE GONE WITH A DRY FORECAST 
FOR SUNDAY...WITH HIGHEST CLOUD COVER IN THE SOUTH AND EAST.

331 AM CDT SAT AUG 28 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
CLOUDS HAVE BEEN INCREASING ACROSS MUCH OF ARKANSAS THIS MORNING PER 
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND SATELLITE IMAGES. SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED 
ACROSS THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE CWFA ALONG THE PREFRONTAL TROUGH. 
WILL EXPECT THESE SHOWERS TO SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA LATER THIS 
MORNING. 

THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT FROM 
CENTRAL MISSOURI...TO SOUTHEAST KANSAS...TO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA WITH 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE FRONT. THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE 
TO MOVE SOUTHEAST TODAY WITH HELP FROM THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE MID 
SECTION OF THE U.S. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE 
FRONT. MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM. THE 
FRONT SHOULD EXIT SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS ON SUNDAY AND WILL TAPER POPS 
DOWN FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST FOR SUNDAY. HIGH PRESSURE MOVES IN 
FOR MONDAY AND DRY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. 

CROSS SECTIONS SHOW ABUNDANT MOISTURE ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH SUNDAY 
MORNING. MUCH DRIER AIR ADVECTS IN SUNDAY. ARKANSAS WILL BE BACK IN 
THE NORTHWEST FLOW BY MONDAY. 

TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT COOLER TODAY WITH EXCESSIVE CLOUD COVER 
AND PRECIPITATION. DRIER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA TONIGHT AND 
SUNDAY...RIDDING THE AIR OF MUCH OF THE HUMIDITY.
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
AS HAS BEEN THE CASE OVER THE PAST FEW NIGHTS...THE MEDIUM RANGE 
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE EXCELLENT AGREEMENT AND JUST A BLEND OF 
SOLUTIONS WITH A SLIGHT JOG TOWARDS THE MORE CONSISTENT GFS IS 
REQUIRED. REGARDLESS...IT LOOKS A RATHER BENIGN PATTERN WILL 
PREDOMINATE THIS PERIOD WITH TEMPERATURES HOVERING RIGHT AROUND 
SEASONAL NORMS. MODELS ARE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH KEEPING CONSIDERABLY 
DRIER AIR OVER THE REGION AS SPRAWLING AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
PREDOMINATE MOST OF THE PERIOD. 

PERIOD STARTS OFF WITH HIGH PRESSURE WELL IN CONTROL ON THE SURFACE 
WITH A PATTERN ALOFT THAT IS NON EVENTFUL AT BEST. DAYS FOUR AND 
FIVE AND CHARACTERIZED BY MOISTURE TRYING TO MOVE INTO THE AREA ON 
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH CENTERED IN THE OHIO VALLEY. WITH 
NO SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVES NOTED AND EVEN LESS DYNAMICS...WILL 
CONTINUE THE CURRENT DRY FORECAST. SURFACE HIGH HAS MOVED OFF TO THE 
EAST BY FRIDAY MORNING WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN BOTH 
TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY. MODELS KEEPING DEW POINT TEMPERATURES IN 
THE 60S EVEN OUT THROUGH DAY SEVEN SO OVERALL CONDITIONS WILL NOT BE 
OPPRESSIVE. CURRENT FORECAST HAS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER THE 
SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE CWA ON DAY SEVEN AND THIS LOOKS 
REASONABLE WITH RETURN FLOW SETTING BACK UP AND MODELS HINTING AT A 
WEAK SHORTWAVE APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

OVERALL FORECAST LOOKS TO BE IN OUTSTANDING SHAPE AND ONLY A FEW 
SUPERFICIAL CHANGES ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
331 AM CDT SAT AUG 28 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
CLOUDS HAVE BEEN INCREASING ACROSS MUCH OF ARKANSAS THIS MORNING PER 
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND SATELLITE IMAGES. SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED 
ACROSS THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE CWFA ALONG THE PREFRONTAL TROUGH. 
WILL EXPECT THESE SHOWERS TO SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA LATER THIS 
MORNING. 

THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT FROM 
CENTRAL MISSOURI...TO SOUTHEAST KANSAS...TO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA WITH 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE FRONT. THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE 
TO MOVE SOUTHEAST TODAY WITH HELP FROM THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE MID 
SECTION OF THE U.S. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE 
FRONT. MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM. THE 
FRONT SHOULD EXIT SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS ON SUNDAY AND WILL TAPER POPS 
DOWN FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST FOR SUNDAY. HIGH PRESSURE MOVES IN 
FOR MONDAY AND DRY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. 

CROSS SECTIONS SHOW ABUNDANT MOISTURE ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH SUNDAY 
MORNING. MUCH DRIER AIR ADVECTS IN SUNDAY. ARKANSAS WILL BE BACK IN 
THE NORTHWEST FLOW BY MONDAY. 

TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT COOLER TODAY WITH EXCESSIVE CLOUD COVER 
AND PRECIPITATION. DRIER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA TONIGHT AND 
SUNDAY...RIDDING THE AIR OF MUCH OF THE HUMIDITY.
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
AS HAS BEEN THE CASE OVER THE PAST FEW NIGHTS...THE MEDIUM RANGE 
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE EXCELLENT AGREEMENT AND JUST A BLEND OF 
SOLUTIONS WITH A SLIGHT JOG TOWARDS THE MORE CONSISTENT GFS IS 
REQUIRED. REGARDLESS...IT LOOKS A RATHER BENIGN PATTERN WILL 
PREDOMINATE THIS PERIOD WITH TEMPERATURES HOVERING RIGHT AROUND 
SEASONAL NORMS. MODELS ARE ALSO CONSISTENT WITH KEEPING CONSIDERABLY 
DRIER AIR OVER THE REGION AS SPRAWLING AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
PREDOMINATE MOST OF THE PERIOD. 

PERIOD STARTS OFF WITH HIGH PRESSURE WELL IN CONTROL ON THE SURFACE 
WITH A PATTERN ALOFT THAT IS NON EVENTFUL AT BEST. DAYS FOUR AND 
FIVE AND CHARACTERIZED BY MOISTURE TRYING TO MOVE INTO THE AREA ON 
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THE HIGH CENTERED IN THE OHIO VALLEY. WITH 
NO SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVES NOTED AND EVEN LESS DYNAMICS...WILL 
CONTINUE THE CURRENT DRY FORECAST. SURFACE HIGH HAS MOVED OFF TO THE 
EAST BY FRIDAY MORNING WITH A CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN BOTH 
TEMPERATURE AND HUMIDITY. MODELS KEEPING DEW POINT TEMPERATURES IN 
THE 60S EVEN OUT THROUGH DAY SEVEN SO OVERALL CONDITIONS WILL NOT BE 
OPPRESSIVE. CURRENT FORECAST HAS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER THE 
SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE CWA ON DAY SEVEN AND THIS LOOKS 
REASONABLE WITH RETURN FLOW SETTING BACK UP AND MODELS HINTING AT A 
WEAK SHORTWAVE APPROACHING FROM THE SOUTHWEST.

OVERALL FORECAST LOOKS TO BE IN OUTSTANDING SHAPE AND ONLY A FEW 
SUPERFICIAL CHANGES ARE NEEDED AT THIS TIME.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
COLD FRONT SLOWLY MAKING ITS WAY DOWN THE PLAINS TOWARD THE AREA WHILE
RIDGING ALOFT CONTINUES FOR THE SHORT TERM. THIS IS KEEPING THE AREA 
CAPPED WITH NO MORE THAN ISOLATED CONVECTION. THIS SHOULD CONTINUE
THROUGH EARLY EVENING. FRONT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE A LITTLE SLOWER
MOVING IN...NOT REACHING THE CWA UNTIL EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. 
CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT WILL LIKELY BE DELAYED BUT 
MODELS DO INCREASE MOISTURE IN THE AREA OVER NIGHT SO COULD SEE
SOME DEVELOPMENT AHEAD OF THE FRONT LATE TONIGHT ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD
STILL BE RATHER ISOLATED AND LIGHT. CUT BACK ON POPS A LITTLE FOR
LATER TONIGHT AND LEFT UNCERTAINTY WORDING IN THE NORTHWEST
BUT ISOLATED WORDING ELSEWHERE. COLD FRONT LIKELY WILL BE SLOW TO
MOVE ACROSS HILLY AREAS OF NORTHWEST SATURDAY AND THIS MAY ALLOW 
CENTRAL AND SOUTH TO HEAT UP SOMEWHAT...REACHING NEAR OR A LITTLE 
ABOVE 90 AGAIN. HEAT INDEX SHOULD STAY BELOW ADVISORY LEVELS BUT MAY 
EXCEED 100 IN PARTS OF THE SOUTHEAST. WILL INCREASE POPS ACROSS
THE AREA TO 50 PERCENT BY AFTERNOON AND WILL PUT IN LIKELY POPS 
ACROSS THE NORTH CLOSER TO THE BETTER DYNAMICS. MAIN UPPER SHORT 
WAVE SHOULD PASS TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA SO SHEAR AND DYNAMICS 
SHOULD NOT BE SUFFICIENT FOR SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER BUT 
ISOLATED SEVERE CANNOT BE RULED OUT WITH THE INSTABILITY IN PLACE.
ALSO 2 PLUS INCHES OF PRECIPITABLE WATER RAISES HEAVY RAIN 
CONCERNS BUT FEEL LIKE GENERAL RAINFALL WILL NOT BE TOO EXCESSIVE
BUT LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN WILL BE LIKELY. WILL CONTINUE 40 TO 50
POPS INTO SATURDAY NIGHT THEN TAPER OFF POPS FROM THE NORTH LATE. 
STILL SOME LACK OF CONFIDENCE WHETHER THE DRIER AIR WILL MOVE
IN THAT FAST AND WENT A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE MODELS. STILL SHOULD
SEE COOLER AIR MOVE INTO MOST OF THE AREA WITH MOST MINS IN THE 60S
AND THE NORTH NEAR 60. KEPT SOME POPS IN SUNDAY EXCEPT IN THE NORTH
BUT END ALL CHANCE OF RAIN BY THE END OF THE DAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
TO THE NORTH SHOULD BRING DRY AND MILD WEATHER IN THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT. HAVE CONCERN FOR SHORT WAVE IN NORTHWEST FLOW MONDAY NIGHT
BUT WILL IGNORE FOR NOW. WILL NEED TO WATCH THIS OVER THE NEXT FEW
MODEL RUNS.   
&& 

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
NOT MUCH CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO GOING FORECAST. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED. H5 
FLOW WILL VARY FROM NORTHWESTERLY TO NEAR ZONAL...WITH SEVERAL AREAS 
OF MOISTURE MOVING ACROSS IN THE MEAN FLOW. HOWEVER...LACK OF A 
FORCING MECHANISM...ALONG WITH CAPPING THAT WILL LIKELY TO BE OVER 
THE AREA PRECLUDES THE MENTION OF RAIN CHANCES FOR DAYS 4 THROUGH 6 
AT THIS TIME.

BY LATE WEDNESDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE EASTWARD TOWARD THE 
APPALACHIANS...WITH RETURN FLOW SETTING UP OVER THE AREA. THUS...
TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE TOWARD MORE SEASONAL LEVELS. A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL RETURN TO THE FORECAST FOR

300 PM CDT THU AUG 26 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
UPPER RIDGE SHOULD DOMINATE THE AREA THROUGH FRIDAY BEFORE 
UNUSUALLY STRONG UPPER TROF FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR SWINGS ACROSS 
THE PLAINS AND SHOULD GIVE THE COLD FRONT IN THE PLAINS ENOUGH
OF A PUSH TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA. AN UPPER SHEAR AXIS REMAINS
OVER SOUTHERN SECTIUONS THROUGH FRIDAY WITH HIGH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE PRESENT. HOWEVER UPPER RIDGE SHOULD KEEP ENOUGH OF A CAP
ON THE AREA TO PREVENT MUCH CONVECTION FROM FORMING THROUGH EARLY
FRIDAY NIGHT. CANNOT COMPLETELY RULE OUT SOME DIURNALLY DRIVEN 
CONVECTION DUE TO THE MOISTURE INSTABILITY AND SHEAR AXIS...SO WILL
KEEP SMALL POPS GOING IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH ISOLATED 
WORDING IN THE ZONES. COLD FRONT BEARING DOWN ON THE AREA FRIDAY
MAY LEAD TO A LITTLE ADDITIONAL WARMING AND WILL GO WITH MAXES NEAR 
95 IN MOST OF CENTRAL AND SOUTH AND ABOUT A CATEGORY COOLER IN THE 
NORTH. HEAT INDEX REACHES ADVISORY LEVELS FOR AN HOUR OR TWO IN 
CENTRAL AND SOUTH ON FRIDAY BUT THIS IS NOT EXPECTED TO CONTINUE 
SATURDAY SO ADVISORY CRITERIA WILL NOT BE MET. HIGH HEAT INDICES 
FOR FRIDAY CAN BE HANDLED BY ZONE TEXT AND HWO. MODELS BRING THE 
COLD FRONT THROUGH FASTER NOW AND THIS LOOKS REASONABLE AS THE UPPER 
TROF SWINGS ACROSS THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY. LOOKS LIKE FRONT
WILL REACH THE NORTHWEST LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND WILL VERY SLOWLY GET 
THROUGH THE HILLS IN THE NORTHWEST INTO SATURDAY BEFORE MOVING 
MORE RAPIDLY THROUGH THE REST OF THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL 
INCREASE POPS IN THE NORTHWEST LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND ELSEWHERE BY 
SATURDAY MORNING. FOR NOW WILL MAX POPS OUT AT 50 PERCENT SATURDAY
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA AND CONTINUE WITH 40 PERCENT POPS
SATURDAY NIGHT. EVOLUTION OF SYSTEM SUGGESTS CHANCES OF RAIN WILL
END IN MOST AREAS BY SUNDAY MORNING BUT WILL CONTINUE SOME POPS
THROUGH THE DAY SUNDAY IN CASE THE FRONT HANGS UP. CONTINUED SMALL
POPS IN THE SOUTHEAST INTO EARLY SUNDAY NIGHT FOR THE SAME 
REASONING. FASTER FRONTAL PROGRESS LED TO LOWERING TEMP FORECASTS
A LITTLE FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.   
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL SET UP OVER THE AREA FOR THE BEGINNING OF 
THE WEEK. HOWEVER...WITH SURFACE HIGH MOVING DOWN FROM THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS...ANY CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL BE SUPPRESSED. RIDGE OVER THE 
AREA AND NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL ALLOW FOR NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD. SURFACE RIDGE WILL 
BEGIN MOVING OFF TO THE EAST BY LATE WEDNESDAY...WITH RETURN FLOW 
SETTING UP. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE...AND RAIN CHANCES RETURN TO THE 
FORECAST BY THURSDAY...AS A SHORTWAVE WILL APPROACH FROM WEST 
TEXAS.

.DISCUSSION... 
UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA AND RAOB SHOWS SEVERAL CAPS PRESENT. AIR
MASS IS VERY MOIST AND UNSTABLE WITH THE MAIN MOISTURE AT LOW LEVELS.
CAPS SHOULD KEEP SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM DEVELOPING FOR THE 
MOST PART BUT CANNOT RULE OUT ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT. ANYTHING THAT 
IS ABLE TO DEVELOP COULD PULSE TO SEVERE LEVELS LIKE WHAT HAPPENED
LAST EVENING. KEPT 20 PERCENT POPS IN ZONE PRODUCTS AND LOWERED POPS
TO 16 PERCENT IN GRIDS...WHICH LOOKS TOO HIGH...BUT DECIDED TO KEEP
MENTION IN THE FORECAST FOR ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT. CHANGED WORDING
FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING TO ISOLATED WHICH SHOULD BETTER FIT
SCENARIO. MADE SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO TEMPS AND DEW POINTS BASED ON
CURRENT TRENDS BUT THIS MADE LITTLE CHANGE TO OVERALL FORECAST. 
HEAT INDEX VALUES MAY BRIEFLY REACH 105 AT ISOLATED LOCATIONS 
IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON AND FRIDAY BUT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL
NOT BE ENOUGH TO NEED A HEAT ADVISORY. THIS IS COVERED IN THE HWO.
REST OF FORECAST LEFT AS IS FOR NOW. WILL PROBABLY CHANGE WORDING 
TO ISOLATED FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY ON THE AFTERNOON
PACKAGE.

955 AM CDT WED AUG 25 2004

AREA OF SHOWERS AND STORMS MOVING ACROSS EASTERN OKLAHOMA IS 
WEAKENING AS IT MOVES INTO HIGHER PRESSURE AND AWAY FROM THE UPPER 
SUPPORT. FORECAST ALREADY INCLUDES 30 POPS...AND THIS WILL SUFFICE. 
WILL TAKE OUT REFERENCE TO MORNING...OTHERWISE NO OTHER CHANGES NOW. 
UPDATE WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS...32.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
LOW CLOUDS/STRATUS BEGINNING TO FORM OVER THE AREA...WITH SOUTH 
WINDS BRINGING MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY OVER 
NORTHERN MISSOURI/SOUTHERN IOWA THIS MORNING...AND MOVING EAST.

SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE BRINGING UPPER LEVEL ENERGY INTO 
THE STATE...AS HAS BEEN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. MODELS ARE DIFFERING 
ON STRENGTH AND SPEED...WITH THE ETA BEING THE STRONGEST. HAVE USED 
A BLEND OF MODELS...AND CONTINUED SCATTERED POPS WITH SOME TWEAKS IN 
THE TIMING.

AFTER SYSTEM TODAY MOVES EAST THIS EVENING...MOISTURE RETURN IS 
RATHER WEAK. HOWEVER...WILL NOT RULE OUT DIURNAL CONVECTION THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. SAME SITUATION AS WELL ON 
FRIDAY...AHEAD OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT IN THE PLAINS.

COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE STATE DURING THE DAY SATURDAY... 
SIMILAR TO TIMING FROM MODEL RUNS TUESDAY. SCATTERED POPS ACROSS THE 
STATE DUE TO THIS FEATURE SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.

CURRENT TEMPERATURE FORECASTS LOOK GOOD. READINGS WILL BE NEAR TO 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TODAY...AND INCREASE A COUPLE OF DEGREES 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. TEMPS WILL BE SLIGHTLY LOWER SATURDAY DUE TO 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND CLOUDS. OVERALL...A BLEND OF GUIDANCE WAS 
USED. HEAT INDEX READINGS WILL BE IN THE 100 TO 105 DEGREE RANGE IN 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS DURING THE AFTERNOONS TODAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY...AND WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED IF TEMPS WARM.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
MODELS STILL IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING NEXT CDFNT THRU THE AREA EARLY 
IN THE PD. TIMING ACRS AR STILL LOOKS TO BE ON SUNDAY. STILL SOME 
CONCERN OF HOW FAR WILL FNT WORK S OF THE AREA. HAVE KEPT PRECIP 
TRENDS OF CURRENT FCST IN TACT. LATEST GFS MOS DATA GIVING LIKELY 
POPS WITH FROPA ON SUN. HAVE STUCK WITH HIGH CHC POPS FOR NOW. TEMPS 
LOOK GOOD AND NO SIG CHGS MADE.

AREA OF SHOWERS AND STORMS MOVING ACROSS EASTERN OKLAHOMA IS 
WEAKENING AS IT MOVES INTO HIGHER PRESSURE AND AWAY FROM THE UPPER 
SUPPORT. FORECAST ALREADY INCLUDES 30 POPS...AND THIS WILL SUFFICE. 
WILL TAKE OUT REFERENCE TO MORNING...OTHERWISE NO OTHER CHANGES NOW. 
UPDATE WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS...32.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
LOW CLOUDS/STRATUS BEGINNING TO FORM OVER THE AREA...WITH SOUTH 
WINDS BRINGING MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY OVER 
NORTHERN MISSOURI/SOUTHERN IOWA THIS MORNING...AND MOVING EAST.

SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE BRINGING UPPER LEVEL ENERGY INTO 
THE STATE...AS HAS BEEN THE LAST SEVERAL DAYS. MODELS ARE DIFFERING 
ON STRENGTH AND SPEED...WITH THE ETA BEING THE STRONGEST. HAVE USED 
A BLEND OF MODELS...AND CONTINUED SCATTERED POPS WITH SOME TWEAKS IN 
THE TIMING.

AFTER SYSTEM TODAY MOVES EAST THIS EVENING...MOISTURE RETURN IS 
RATHER WEAK. HOWEVER...WILL NOT RULE OUT DIURNAL CONVECTION THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. SAME SITUATION AS WELL ON 
FRIDAY...AHEAD OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT IN THE PLAINS.

COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE STATE DURING THE DAY SATURDAY... 
SIMILAR TO TIMING FROM MODEL RUNS TUESDAY. SCATTERED POPS ACROSS THE 
STATE DUE TO THIS FEATURE SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.

CURRENT TEMPERATURE FORECASTS LOOK GOOD. READINGS WILL BE NEAR TO 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TODAY...AND INCREASE A COUPLE OF DEGREES 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. TEMPS WILL BE SLIGHTLY LOWER SATURDAY DUE TO 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND CLOUDS. OVERALL...A BLEND OF GUIDANCE WAS 
USED. HEAT INDEX READINGS WILL BE IN THE 100 TO 105 DEGREE RANGE IN 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS DURING THE AFTERNOONS TODAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY...AND WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED IF TEMPS WARM.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
MODELS STILL IN GOOD AGREEMENT TAKING NEXT CDFNT THRU THE AREA EARLY 
IN THE PD. TIMING ACRS AR STILL LOOKS TO BE ON SUNDAY. STILL SOME 
CONCERN OF HOW FAR WILL FNT WORK S OF THE AREA. HAVE KEPT PRECIP 
TRENDS OF CURRENT FCST IN TACT. LATEST GFS MOS DATA GIVING LIKELY 
POPS WITH FROPA ON SUN. HAVE STUCK WITH HIGH CHC POPS FOR NOW. TEMPS

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
MINOR FEATURES IN THE WEAK FLOW ALOFT WILL BE CONTRIBUTING MORE 
INSTABILITY TO THE WARM AND HUMID AIR IN PLACE OVER THE STATE. THE 
MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE WILL BE AFFECTING ARKANSAS BEYOND THE 
SHORT RANGE. AT THE SURFACE...LINEAR MCS MOVING THROUGH MO NOW WILL 
BE GETTING CLOSE TO OUR NORTHERN BORDER AND LAYING DOWN A BOUNDARY 
THAT MAY BE THE FOCUS OF SOME CONVECTION LATE TONIGHT OR TOMORROW. 
CONVECTION WILL HAVE A DIURNAL FLAVOR TO IT...BUT KEPT POPS LOW. MOS 
NUMBERS FROM MAV AND FWC WERE SIMILAR VARYING ONLY A DEGREE HERE AND 
THERE...BUT THEY WERE DIFFERENT IN THE POPS WITH THE NGM BEING THE 
DRIER OF THE TWO...SO USED MAV FOR POPS. LITTLE CHANGE IN THE 
PATTERN SINCE SOUTHERLY FETCH WILL KEEP HIGH HUMIDITIES AT THE 
SURFACE. THIS WILL PUSH HI VALUES IN THE 100 TO NEAR 105 RANGE...BUT 
NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO REQUIRE ANY HEAT ADVISORIES YET.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE AREA OVER THE WEEKEND...LOOKING 
MORE LIKE ON SUNDAY. STILL QUESTION WHETHER UPPER FLOW WILL BUCKLE 
ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE FRONT TO MOVE ACROSS THE CWA. UPPER TROF STILL 
INDICATED TO PASS ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT SO THIS SHOULD GIVE 
THE FRONT ENOUGH PUSH TO MOVE THROUGH. MADE SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO 
POPS TO REFLECT SLOWER FRONTAL PASSAGE. LOWERED TO 30 PERCENT 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AND PUT IN SEVERAL HOURS OF 40 PERCENT 
POPS ON SUNDAY. LOWERED POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND KEPT MONDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY DRY FOR NOW THOUGH CONFIDENCE NOT THE GREATEST OVER 
THAT. MADE ONLY MINOR TWEAKS TO OTHER GRIDS THROUGH MONDAY BUT 
LOWERED MINS A LITTLE FOR MONDAY NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH 
SHOULD BE IN CONTROL OF THE AREA AND THAT IS ALSO PREDICATED ON 
FRONT MOVING THROUGH ENOUGH TO CLEAR SKIES OUT. WENT FOR MAXES

WITH SFC FNT STILL EXPECTED TO LIFT SLOLY NWD OVER THE NEXT 24 
HOURS...HAVE CONTD WITH SCTD POPS FOR MUCH OF THE AREA. CLOUDS AND 
RAINFALL COVERAGE WITH AFFECT MAX TEMPS TODAY AND HAVE USED A BLEND 
OF VARIOUS MODEL MOS NUMBERS.

HAVE LEFT SCTD POPS IN THE FCST FOR MON AND TUE WITH SEVERAL MORE 
IMPULSES ALOFT PROGGED TO AFFECT THE FA. USED A BLEND OF ETA AND GFS 
MOS FOR TEMPS.

BY WED...UPPER FLOW BEGINS TO AMPLIFY WITH UPPER RIDGING OVER THE 
ERN STATES AND DVLP TROF IN THE W. THIS WILL ALLOW A SFC CDFNT TO 
SLOLY APCH FROM THE W...RESULTING IN ANOTHER CHC OF SHRA/TSRA. 
EXPECT WARMER TEMPS AHEAD OF FNT...BUT HAVE GONE MORE WITH COOLER 
ETA MOS NUMBERS DUE TO EFFECTS OF INCRSG CLOUDS.

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WITH WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL 
LEAD TO DIURNAL PRECIP THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE

STALLED OUT. FRONT ALSO SEEMS TO BE LESS DEFINED THAN JUST A FEW 
HOURS AGO. SCATTERED SHOWERS CONTINUE OVER THE SOUTH IN THE VICINITY 
OF THE FRONT AND OVER THE WEST. LATEST WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS A 
WEAK WAVE ALONG THE RED RIVER WHICH THE MODELS SLIDE EASTWARD 
OVERNIGHT. 

COMBINATION OF FRONT AND WAVE WILL REQUIRE SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW

SLIGHTLY ACROSS THE CENTRAL SECTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE APPROACHING

GOING FORECAST PRETTY MUCH ON TARGET...WITH COLD FRONT SLIDING INTO 
ARKANSAS FROM THE NORTH...AND PRETTY MUCH STALLING SOMEWHERE NEAR 
THE ARKANSAS/LOUISIANA BORDER DURING THE WEEKEND. THE RESULT WILL BE 
CONTINUED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY OVER THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE STATE.

WILL HAVE TO BE A BIT CAREFUL AS TO WHERE FRONT SETS UP...WITH HEAVY 
RAINFALL POSSIBLE NEAR THE FRONT. SHOULD THE FRONT DECIDE TO STALL 
FARTHER NORTH...PRECIPITATION WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TOWARD CENTRAL 
SECTIONS OF THE STATE WHERE RECORD RAINFALL OCCURRED OVERNIGHT. 
AMOUNTS OF 2 TO 5 INCHES OCCURRED FROM LITTLE ROCK TOWARD HOT 
SPRINGS.   

AS FAR AS FORECAST CHANGES...TWEAKED PRECIPITATION CHANCES A BIT 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH HIGHEST CHANCES SOUTH OF LITTLE ROCK. RADAR 
SHOWING THAT SHOWERS HAVE TAPERED OFF IN THE NORTHERN 
COUNTIES...WITH SHOWERS/A FEW THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUING IN THE 
SOUTHERN COUNTIES. 

GIVEN THAT CLOUDS/PRECIPITATION MOST CONCENTRATED IN SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS...LOWERED AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES THERE A FEW DEGREES.

LOOKING AHEAD...DATA SUGGESTS THAT STALLED FRONT WILL HEAD BACK TO 
THE NORTH EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS IN RESPONSE TO A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES. WILL BE SCATTERED 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS TO BEGIN NEXT WEEK. ONCE FRONT DEPARTS TO THE 
NORTH...WILL HAVE MOSTLY DRY AND WARM WEATHER...WHICH IS TYPICAL FOR 
SUMMERTIME. (46)

HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT IN THE WORKS TONIGHT/FRIDAY AS COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM NORTH AND INTERACTS WITH A SHORTWAVE IN THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS. IN RESPONSE TO SHORTWAVE...SURFACE LOW WILL DEVELOP ALONG 
FRONT...AND WILL TRACK THROUGH NORTHWEST ARKANSAS/SOUTHERN MISSOURI 
OVERNIGHT. 

HAVE GONE WITH CATEGORICAL POPS OVERNIGHT...WITH RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
OF HALF AN INCH TO AN INCH COMMON. HOWEVER...WOULD SURMISE THAT 
QUITE A FEW AREAS IN WESTERN HALF OF STATE WILL MEASURE 1 TO 2 
INCHES...WITH LOCALLY MORE. HAVE MENTIONED POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY     
RAIN IN THE FORECAST.

FRONT TO NORTHWEST WILL EDGE INTO THE STATE ON FRIDAY...AND WILL 
SLOWLY PUSH SOUTHWARD FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THE NORTHWEST FLOW 
OF THE PAST THAT RUSHED FRONTS THROUGH IS GONE...WITH CLOSER TO 
ZONAL FLOW THIS TIME. THIS NOT ONLY MEANS THAT COOLER/DRIER AIR WILL 
BE SLOWER TO ARRIVE...THERE WILL ALSO BE HEALTHY CHANCES FOR RAIN 
INTO THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL BE ESPECIALLY TRUE 
SOUTH OF LITTLE ROCK AS FRONT SLOWS DOWN/COMES TO A GRINDING HALT.

GIVEN THAT THE FRONT MAY STALL...HAVE KEPT AT LEAST SMALL CHANCES 
FOR RAIN IN SOUTHERN ARKANSAS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. HAVE ALSO KEPT IN 
MORE CLOUDS/UPPED DEWPOINTS A BIT BEHIND FRONT. 

HEADING INTO NEXT WEEK...FRONT LOOKS LIKE IT MAY HEAD BACK TO THE

FRONT WILL DROP SOUTH ON FRIDAY...WITH LOTS OF CLOUDS AND 
DECENT CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION CONTINUING. FRONT WILL FINALLY
EXIT REGION TO SOUTH AS THE WEEKEND BEGINS...WITH HIGH PRESSURE
BEHIND FRONT PROVIDING SLIGHTLY COOLER/DRIER AIR.

BY NEXT WEEK...APPEARS THAT RIDGE WILL BEGIN BUILDING OVER CENTRAL

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
MAIN ISSUE THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL BE PASSAGE OF UPPER LEVEL WAVES...
AFFECTING WESTERN AND NORTHERN ARKANSAS. PERSISTENT SURFACE RIDGE 
WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST 
AREA FOR SEVERAL DAYS. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW REGIME AT H5 WILL ALLOW 
FOR SEVERAL IMPULSES TO MOVE DOWN IN THE MEAN FLOW. THE FIRST ONE 
WILL BE TONIGHT. ONGOING ISOLD/WDLY SCT CONVECTION OVER SRN KS/NRN 
OK WILL MOVE EASTWARD TONIGHT. DUE TO A GENERAL LACK OF MOISTURE AND 
FAIRLY STRONG CAP...DONT EXPECT ANYTHING MORE THAN ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS IF ANYTHING AT ALL. 

NEXT SYSTEM WILL PASS THROUGH ON TUESDAY...MAINLY AFFECTING NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS WITH ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. BY 
WEDNESDAY...H5 RIDGE WILL BUILD UP FROM THE GULF. FAIRLY STRONG 
FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST...BUT WITH THE RIDGE 
BUILDING...FORWARD PROGRESSION OF THE SYSTEM WILL LIKELY BE HALTED 
FOR A FEW DAYS. 

SURFACE RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY MOVE EAST BY THURSDAY...WITH RETURN 
FLOW SETTING UP IN ITS WAKE. THUS...TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE BACK 
TOWARD MORE SEASONAL LEVELS.
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
BY LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...H5 RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN UNITED 
STATES WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD...FINALLY ALLOWING FOR A FRONTAL 
PASSAGE ON SATURDAY. ABUNDANCE OF CLOUD COVER SHOULD ACT TO HOLD 
TEMPERATURES DOWN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. AS THE FRONT EXITS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY...NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL SET UP ONCE 
AGAIN...WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIR RETURNING TO ARKANSAS. THIS WILL 
ALLOW FOR SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES TO BEGIN THE NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
MAIN ISSUE THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL BE PASSAGE OF UPPER LEVEL WAVES...
AFFECTING WESTERN AND NORTHERN ARKANSAS. PERSISTENT SURFACE RIDGE 
WILL REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST 
AREA FOR SEVERAL DAYS. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW REGIME AT H5 WILL ALLOW 
FOR SEVERAL IMPULSES TO MOVE DOWN IN THE MEAN FLOW. THE FIRST ONE 
WILL BE TONIGHT. ONGOING ISOLD/WDLY SCT CONVECTION OVER SRN KS/NRN 
OK WILL MOVE EASTWARD TONIGHT. DUE TO A GENERAL LACK OF MOISTURE AND 
FAIRLY STRONG CAP...DONT EXPECT ANYTHING MORE THAN ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS IF ANYTHING AT ALL. 

NEXT SYSTEM WILL PASS THROUGH ON TUESDAY...MAINLY AFFECTING NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS WITH ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. BY 
WEDNESDAY...H5 RIDGE WILL BUILD UP FROM THE GULF. FAIRLY STRONG 
FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST...BUT WITH THE RIDGE 
BUILDING...FORWARD PROGRESSION OF THE SYSTEM WILL LIKELY BE HALTED 
FOR A FEW DAYS. 

SURFACE RIDGE WILL GRADUALLY MOVE EAST BY THURSDAY...WITH RETURN 
FLOW SETTING UP IN ITS WAKE. THUS...TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE BACK 
TOWARD MORE SEASONAL LEVELS.
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
BY LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...H5 RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN UNITED 
STATES WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD...FINALLY ALLOWING FOR A FRONTAL 
PASSAGE ON SATURDAY. ABUNDANCE OF CLOUD COVER SHOULD ACT TO HOLD 
TEMPERATURES DOWN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. AS THE FRONT EXITS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY...NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL SET UP ONCE 
AGAIN...WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIR RETURNING TO ARKANSAS. THIS WILL 
ALLOW FOR SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES TO BEGIN THE NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES ACROSS THE AREA AT THE SURFACE. AN UPPER 
TROUGH OVER THE AREA THAT HAS BEEN BRINGING NORTHWEST FLOW TO THE 
AREA WILL SHIFT FURTHER EAST ON MONDAY. DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT 
OVER THE WESTERN U.S. THE NORTHWEST FLOW WILL CONTINUE OVER 
ARKANSAS. CONVECTION IN CENTRAL OKLAHOMA WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD MID 
AND HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS MAINLY NORTH AND WEST ARKNASAS TONIGHT. 
PRECIP WILL NOT MAKE IT INTO ARKANSAS TONIGHT THOUGH WITH MUCH DRIER 
AIR IN ARKANSAS. DEW POINTS ARE IN THE 50S IN ARKANSAS AND IN THE 
MID 60S IN OKLAHOMA.  

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING A SHORT WAVE ACROSS THE 
AREA ON MONDAY. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FOR MONDAY AS THIS SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH. FEEL THAT 
PRECIP WILL BE VERY ISOLATED IN NATURE. TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WILL 
BE QUIET. CHANCES OF PRECIP WILL RETURN ON THURSDAY AS LOW PRESSURE 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. 

SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL RETURN ON TUESDAY AND THIS WILL HELP TO WARM 
TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEK. TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN 
TO NORMAL BY MID WEEK.
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...
PATTERN NOT NEARLY AS AMPLIFIED AS PREVIOUS RUNS WERE SHOWING BUT 
PERIOD STILL STARTS WITH RIDGING OVER THE WEST COAST AND DEEP VORTEX 
OVER SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA. ALL MEDIUM RANGE MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THEIR SOLUTIONS SO A BLEND WILL BE USED WITH A LEAN TOWARDS THE 
MORE CONSISTENT GFS. TROF APPROACHES EARLY THE PERIOD WITH GOOD 
MOISTURE RETURN OFF THE GULF AND DECENT LOOKING SHORT WAVE 
ACCOMPANIED WITH GOOD LIFT. WILL CONTINUE SCATTERED POPS AT THIS 
POINT BUT WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE HIGHER POPS AS THE WEEK 
PROGRESSES.

FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL THEN BEGIN TOO PRESS DOWN FROM THE NORTH ON 
SATURDAY BUT NEVER SEEMS TO QUITE MAKE IT THROUGH THE STATE 
BEFORE RETREATING BACK TO THE NORTH AS TROPICAL SYSTEM WORKS INTO 
THE GULF. SYSTEM SHOULD BE PICKED UP AND SHUNTED EAST BY TROF 
SITTING OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY AS RIDGE TRIES TO 
REBUILD OVER THE WEST. SUNDAY LOOKS TO BE DRY AT THIS POINT BUT WITH 
TROPICAL SYSTEM IN THE GULF NEXT WEEKEND...CONFIDENCE IS LESS THAN 
TERRIFIC. TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO SEASONABLE NORMAL WITH DEW 
POINT TEMPERATURES SLOWLY CREEPING UPWARDS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

148 PM CDT SAT AUG 14 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
GFS CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST CONSISTENT MODEL ALTHOUGH ITS TRENDING 
SLIGHTLY FASTER AND A LITTLE DEEPER WITH THE CENTRAL CONUS TROF 
VERSUS THIS TIME YESTERDAY. ETA ALSO A TAD FASTER BUT CONTINUES TO 
WAFFLE A BIT WITH SPEED AND INTENSITY OF THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS. GFS 
SEEMS TO BE THE BETTER CHOICE AND WILL FOLLOW ITS SOLUTION PRETTY 
CLOSELY.

MID LEVEL WAVE CLEARLY SEEN ON SATELLITE CONTINUES TO MOVE ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI. MESO-ETA SEEMS TO HAVE THE BEST HANDLE ON THIS 
FEATURE AND KEEPS IT OUT OF THE CWA. RADAR TRENDS SUPPORT THIS AND 
EVEN THOUGH A SPRINKLE OR TWO CAN NOT BE RULED OVER THE NORTHEAST 
PART OF THE CWA...PRECIP CHANCES NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO BE INCLUDED IN 
THE PACKAGE THIS EVENING. OTHERWISE ANOTHER DAY OF RELATIVELY DRY 
AND COOL AIR FOR MID AUGUST.

UPPER LEVEL FLOW STILL HIGHLY AMPLIFIED WITH STRONG RIDGING OVER THE 
WEST AND DEEP TROF OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. PATTERN SLOWLY 
FLATTENS OUT DURING THE PERIOD AS STRONG SHORTWAVE TRIES TO KNOCK 
DOWN THE RIDGE AND THE TROF FILLS IN AND LIFTS OUT. NORTHWEST FLOW 
CONTINUES FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE PERIOD WITH SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL 
DISTURBANCES TRAVERSING THE AREA. MOISTURE WITH ALL THESE WAVES IS 
LIMITED AT BEST AND IN SOME CASES LESS THAN THAT. WILL GO AHEAD AND 
PULL PRECIP FROM THE CURRENT FORECAST MONDAY AS MODELS HAVE CUT WAY 
BACK ON THE MOISTURE.

MODELS DEVELOP INTENSE UPPER LEVEL VORTEX ACROSS CENTRAL CANADA BY 
MID WEEK. RESULT IS A MUCH BROADER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN TIER 
STATES AND THE FLOW ACTUALLY TAKES ON MORE OF A WESTERLY COMPONENT. 
BUT WITH NO SIGNIFICANT WAVES/FRONTS SEEN...WILL GO DRY THROUGH OUT 
THE ENTIRE PERIOD.

ON THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL PRETTY MUCH DOMINATE 
THROUGH THE PERIOD BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE COMES UP ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE RIDGE TO KEEP CONDITIONS PARTLY CLOUDY AT LEAST. 

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...NORTHWEST FLOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES 
BELOW NORMAL AND DEW POINT TEMPERATURES IN CHECK...AT LEAST 
INITIALLY. AS FLOW DAMPENS OUT...TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY RISE AS 
MID LEVEL HEIGHTS INCREASE AND WINDS TAKE ON MORE OF A SOUTHERLY 
COMPONENT AS SURFACE RIDGE IS PUSHED EAST. DEW POINT TEMPERATURES 
WILL ALSO BE ON THE RISE AS GULF STARTS TO OPEN UP SOMEWHAT.
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
MODELS SHOW THE RIDGE MOVING EAST OF THE AREA ON THURSDAY AND ALLOW 
A TROUGH TO MOVE INTO THE REGION FROM THE WEST. AN UPPER LOW WILL 
REMAIN OVER THE AREA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW A COLD 
FRONT TO ENTER THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE EARLY SATURDAY. THE SLOW 
MOVEMENT OF THE UPPER LOW IMPLIES THAT THE FRONT WILL STALL ACROSS 
THE MIDDLE OF ARKANSAS. IN ANY CASE SEVERAL SHORT WAVES WILL ALSO

148 PM CDT SAT AUG 14 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
GFS CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST CONSISTENT MODEL ALTHOUGH ITS TRENDING 
SLIGHTLY FASTER AND A LITTLE DEEPER WITH THE CENTRAL CONUS TROF 
VERSUS THIS TIME YESTERDAY. ETA ALSO A TAD FASTER BUT CONTINUES TO 
WAFFLE A BIT WITH SPEED AND INTENSITY OF THE VARIOUS SYSTEMS. GFS 
SEEMS TO BE THE BETTER CHOICE AND WILL FOLLOW ITS SOLUTION PRETTY 
CLOSELY.

MID LEVEL WAVE CLEARLY SEEN ON SATELLITE CONTINUES TO MOVE ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST MISSOURI. MESO-ETA SEEMS TO HAVE THE BEST HANDLE ON THIS 
FEATURE AND KEEPS IT OUT OF THE CWA. RADAR TRENDS SUPPORT THIS AND 
EVEN THOUGH A SPRINKLE OR TWO CAN NOT BE RULED OVER THE NORTHEAST 
PART OF THE CWA...PRECIP CHANCES NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO BE INCLUDED IN 
THE PACKAGE THIS EVENING. OTHERWISE ANOTHER DAY OF RELATIVELY DRY 
AND COOL AIR FOR MID AUGUST.

UPPER LEVEL FLOW STILL HIGHLY AMPLIFIED WITH STRONG RIDGING OVER THE 
WEST AND DEEP TROF OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. PATTERN SLOWLY 
FLATTENS OUT DURING THE PERIOD AS STRONG SHORTWAVE TRIES TO KNOCK 
DOWN THE RIDGE AND THE TROF FILLS IN AND LIFTS OUT. NORTHWEST FLOW 
CONTINUES FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE PERIOD WITH SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL 
DISTURBANCES TRAVERSING THE AREA. MOISTURE WITH ALL THESE WAVES IS 
LIMITED AT BEST AND IN SOME CASES LESS THAN THAT. WILL GO AHEAD AND 
PULL PRECIP FROM THE CURRENT FORECAST MONDAY AS MODELS HAVE CUT WAY 
BACK ON THE MOISTURE.

MODELS DEVELOP INTENSE UPPER LEVEL VORTEX ACROSS CENTRAL CANADA BY 
MID WEEK. RESULT IS A MUCH BROADER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN TIER 
STATES AND THE FLOW ACTUALLY TAKES ON MORE OF A WESTERLY COMPONENT. 
BUT WITH NO SIGNIFICANT WAVES/FRONTS SEEN...WILL GO DRY THROUGH OUT 
THE ENTIRE PERIOD.

ON THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL PRETTY MUCH DOMINATE 
THROUGH THE PERIOD BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE COMES UP ON THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE RIDGE TO KEEP CONDITIONS PARTLY CLOUDY AT LEAST. 

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...NORTHWEST FLOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES 
BELOW NORMAL AND DEW POINT TEMPERATURES IN CHECK...AT LEAST 
INITIALLY. AS FLOW DAMPENS OUT...TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY RISE AS 
MID LEVEL HEIGHTS INCREASE AND WINDS TAKE ON MORE OF A SOUTHERLY 
COMPONENT AS SURFACE RIDGE IS PUSHED EAST. DEW POINT TEMPERATURES 
WILL ALSO BE ON THE RISE AS GULF STARTS TO OPEN UP SOMEWHAT.
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...
MODELS SHOW THE RIDGE MOVING EAST OF THE AREA ON THURSDAY AND ALLOW 
A TROUGH TO MOVE INTO THE REGION FROM THE WEST. AN UPPER LOW WILL 
REMAIN OVER THE AREA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW A COLD 
FRONT TO ENTER THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE EARLY SATURDAY. THE SLOW 
MOVEMENT OF THE UPPER LOW IMPLIES THAT THE FRONT WILL STALL ACROSS 
THE MIDDLE OF ARKANSAS. IN ANY CASE SEVERAL SHORT WAVES WILL ALSO 
MOVE ACROSS THE AREA AND SET THE STAGE FOR A MOSTLY CLOUDY AND RAINY 
PERIOD FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY 
FOR NOW FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR 
NORMAL.

MID LEVEL WAVE CLEARLY SEEN IN SATELLITE THIS MORNING MOVING ACROSS 
CENTRAL MISSOURI. FEATURE IS PRODUCING SOME RETURNS OVER SOUTHERN 
MISSOURI BUT TRACK OF THE PRECIPITATION WOULD TAKE THE BULK OF IT TO 
THE EAST OF THE CWA. A FEW SPRINKLES ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE EXTREME 
NORTHEAST CORNER OF THE CWA BUT ANY PRECIP WILL BE SHORT LIVED AND 
CAN BE COVERED WITH NOWCASTS. 

OTHERWISE FORECAST LOOKS RIGHT ON TARGET WITH CU FIELD EXPECTED ONCE 
AGAIN TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON SO PARTLY CLOUDY WILL WORK. 
TEMPERATURES ALSO LOOK RIGHT ON TRACK. GRIDS WILL HAVE TO BE TWEAKED 
TO REFLECT CURRENT CONDITIONS AND TRENDS BUT CHANGES TO THE ACTUAL 
PRODUCTS WILL BE NEGLIGIBLE.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
NOT MUCH TO CHANGE IN PREVIOUS FORECAST. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW BRINGS CONTINUING SERIES OF WEAK SHORT WAVES 
CLOSE TO THE AREA EARLY THIS COMING WEEK. PREVIOUS FORECAST HAS 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS MENTIONED FOR NORTHERN AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS FOR 
MONDAY AND MONDAY EVENING. MOISTURE LOOKS TO BE A LITTLE SLIM FOR 
ANY RAINFALL...BUT WITH SOME UNCERTAINTY THERE...WILL NOT FLIP-FLOP 
THE FORECAST BY TAKING IT OUT FOR NOW. LATER MODEL RUNS MAY GET A 
LITTLE BETTER HANDLE ON THIS. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE BELOW 
NORMAL...BUT WILL WARM A FEW DEGREES MORE EACH DAY IN THE SHORT 
TERM. 

UPPER FLOW WILL CONTINUE WEAK AS THE MAIN BULK OF THE WESTERLIES 
WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE BORDER. A BROAD AREA OF LOW HEIGHTS AT H5 
OVER THE ROCKIES WILL BE SLOW TO PUSH EAST FOR WEDNESDAY. THEN IT 
LOSES DEFINITION BY THURSDAY MORNING. THE CORRESPONDING SURFACE 
PATTERN STILL SHOWS A FRONTAL PASSAGE FOR THURSDAY...WITH LINGERING 
MOISTURE BEHIND IT SO KEPT SMALL POPS FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...
SEVERAL RECORD LOWS WERE EITHER SET OR TIED THIS MORNING AS THE 
ATYPICAL WEATHER FOR MID AUGUST CONTINUES. REFER TO LITRERLIT FOR 
THE NEW RECORDS. GFS APPEARS TO BE SLIGHTLY STRONGER WITH THE 
SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES WITH THE ETA STARTING TO LEAN MORE IN ITS 
DIRECTION. WITH THE DIFFERENCES BARELY DISCERNIBLE ...WILL CONTINUE 
THE TREND OF THE PAST FEW DAYS IN GOING WITH A BLEND OF MODEL 
SOLUTIONS. WILL ALSO CONTINUE THE LEAN TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY STRONGER 
AND MORE CONSISTENT GFS.

HIGHLY AMPLIFIED FLOW THIS AFTERNOON WITH DEEP TROFFING OVER CENTRAL 
UNITED STATES AND STRONG RIDGING OVER THE WEST AND CHARLEY HEADING 
TOWARDS CENTRAL FLORIDA. PATTERN MORE REMINISCENT OF LATE FALL THAN 
MID SUMMER WITH WELL ESTABLISHED NORTHWEST FLOW. PATTERN DOES BEGIN 
TO DAMPEN WITH TIME AS EAST COAST TROF FILLS AND BECOMES MORE BROAD. 
WESTERN RIDGE IS FLATTENED OUT SOMEWHAT LATE IN THE PERIOD AS STRONG 
STORM SPINS IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC.  NORTHWEST FLOW WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THE PERIOD BUT DOES BECOME LEST PRONOUNCED.

CU FIELD DEVELOPED PRETTY MUCH ON SCHEDULE THIS AFTERNOON AND SHOULD 
DISSIPATE QUICKLY THIS EVENING WITH LOSS OF HEATING. MODELS SWING A 
COUPLE OF WEAK SHORT WAVES THROUGH TONIGHT BUT EFFECT WILL BE 
MINIMAL AS MOISTURE REMAINS LIMITED. RECORD LOWS MAY BE THREATENED 
IN SEVERAL AREAS ONCE AGAIN.

COOL CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
TEMPERATURES RISING A BIT EACH DAY AS FLOW STARTS TO FLATTEN OUT 
WITH NEAR NORMAL READINGS BACK AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. SURFACE 
HIGH WILL MOVE OFF TO THE EAST ALLOWING FOR MORE OF A RETURN FLOW 
AND A SUBSEQUENT INCREASE IN MOISTURE. MODELS NEVER DO BRING DEW 
POINTS OVER 70 AS GULF STAYS CLOSED SO HUMIDITY WILL REMAIN BELOW 
THE OPPRESSIVE LEVEL.

CONCERNING PRECIPITATION...A FEW WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS ARE 
POSSIBLE THIS EVENING OVER THE NORTH AS A WAVE MOVES THROUGH BUT 
RAIN WILL BE TOO LIMITED TO MENTION IN THE ZONES. WILL TOSS IN SOME 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AS A WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE ARKANSAS

NO CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO THE CURRENT FORECAST AS EVERYTHING LOOKS 
RIGHT ON TRACK. PATTERN REMAINS VERY AMPLIFIED FOR MID AUGUST WITH 
NORTHWEST FLOW CONTINUING OVER THE AREA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE 
TO DOMINATE WITH HIGHS EXPECTED TO TOP OUT AROUND 10 DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL ACROSS THE AREA.

DEEP MOISTURE REMAINS LIMITED BUT ENOUGH BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE 
AROUND THAT AFTERNOON CU FIELD IS EXPECTED BUT PROBABLY NOT AS 
EXTENSIVE AS YESTERDAY. PARTLY CLOUDY WILL WORK. ONLY UPDATE WILL BE 
TO CLEAN UP THE WORDING.
&&

.PREV DISCUSSION...
COOL CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER IN THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
WILL CONTINUE...BUT TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY WARM A FEW DEGREES EACH 
DAY. H5 FLOW REMAINS OUT THE NORTHWEST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. MODELS 
INDICATING THAT ANY SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN WEST OF THE 
AREA...SO HAVE INCLUDED NO POPS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. 

UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN RATHER WEAK...EVEN AS A SHORT WAVE 
DROPS SOUTHEAST INTO IOWA MONDAY AND IT TRAVELS TO THE WESTERN TIP 
OF KENTUCKY BY TUESDAY MORNING. THE FLOW DOES BECOME ZONAL BY 
THURSDAY. AT THE SURFACE...MOISTURE SHOULD REMAIN JUST TO THE NORTH 
AND WEST OF OUR FORECAST AREA AS RIDGE ATTEMPTS TO HANG ON FROM THE 
MID SOUTH ALMOST TO NEW ENGLAND. THE NEXT FRONT WILL BE POISED TO 
CROSS THE STATE DURING THE DAYLIGHT HOURS THURSDAY WITH THE BULK OF 
ITS MOISTURE BEHIND THE SURFACE BOUNDARY. CURRENT PROBABILITIES FOR 
THURSDAY WILL SUFFICE.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
DEEP TROUGH OVER CENTRAL PART OF THE COUNTRY/RIDGE TO WEST...WITH
NORTHERLY FLOW ALOFT OUT OF CANADA. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO
REGION...WITH BREEZY NORTH/NORTHEAST WIND BRINGING WELL BELOW NORMAL
TEMPERATURES.

NO BIG CHANGES THIS WEEKEND. MAY APPROACH RECORD LOW
TEMPERATURES FRIDAY MORNING IN SOME AREAS...WITH READINGS SLOWLY
MODIFYING AS THE WEEKEND PROGRESSES. DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE.

HEADING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...RIDGE IN WEST WILL FLATTEN LEADING
TO MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW. APPEARS THAT TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE
MODIFYING TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS.
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...
WITH NO DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCES IN THE MODELS NOTED THIS
AFTERNOON...WILL CONTINUE THE TREND OF THE PAST FEW DAYS IN GOING
WITH A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS. WILL ALSO CONTINUE THE LEAN TOWARDS THE
SLIGHTLY MORE CONSISTENT GFS.

OVERALL DEAMPLIFICATION ON THE PATTERNS CONTINUES EARLY IN THE
PERIOD AS STRONG EAST COAST TROF FILLS IN AND RIDING OVER THE WEST
GETS FLATTENED OUT. WEAKER VERSION OF THE RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE
ROCKY MOUNTAINS WITH MORE OF A BROAD TROF OVER THE CENTRAL AND
EASTERN CONUS. PATTERN CONTINUES TO FLATTEN OUT DURING THE WEEK AND
LOOKS ALMOST ZONAL BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.

TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY MODERATE FROM BELOW NORMAL TO NEAR NORMAL
DURING THE PERIOD AS INITIAL NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT DAMPENS INTO MORE
OF A WESTERLY ONE AND RETURN FLOW ON THE SURFACE STARTS TO GET
REESTABLISHED. WHILE TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE INCREASE...THE GULF
ESSENTIALLY REMAINS CLOSED WITH DEW POINTS ONLY CLIMBING BACK INTO
THE UPPER 60S.

LITTLE IN THE WAY OF PRECIPITATION EXPECTED THROUGH THE PERIOD.
SEVERAL VERY WEAK DISTURBANCES DROP DOWN IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW BUT
MOST ARE MOISTURE STARVED WITH VERY LITTLE OTHER DYNAMICS NOTED.
BEST CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL BE ON THURSDAY AS YET ANOTHER FRONT
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST.

QUITE A CONTRAST THIS MORNING WHEN COMPARED WITH THIS TIME 
YESTERDAY. LAST REMNANT OF ORGANIZED RAINFALL IS WELL TO THE SOUTH 
OF ARKANSAS...WITH COLD FRONT NOW WELL INTO LOUISIANA. COOLER AND 
DRIER AIR AT THE LOWER LEVELS IS WORKING ITS WAY OVER THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN AND INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS...AS EVIDENCED BY 60 DEGREE 
ISODROSOTHERM FROM NEAR JONESBORO TO HOT SPRINGS TO NORTHWEST OF 
TEXARKANA. ALSO...SPL 06Z RAOB INDICATES SIGNIFICANT DRYING IN THE 
SURFACE-925MB LEVEL. 

SOME LINGERING SPRINKLES MAY BE LEFT OVER EARLY THIS MORNING OVER 
THE SOUTHEAST...BUT THIS WILL QUICKY DISSIPATE BY MID MORNING. 
ALSO...SOME PATCHY FOG HAS BEEN NOTED IN THE VALLEY AREAS OF NERN 
AND ERN OK/SWRN MO/AND NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS BEHIND THE CLEARING 
LINE. WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG IN THE FORECAST THROUGH MID 
MORNING...FOR ABOUT THE NORTHWESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

AREA OF CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE PREVIOUS SYSTEM WILL CLEAR OUT 
LATER THIS MORNING...FOLLOWED BY MORE CLOUDS MOVING IN FROM THE 
NORTHWEST THIS AFTERNOON. THESE WILL MOVE DOWN IN THE NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW ALONG THE BACK EDGE OF H5 LOW MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER MS VLY. 

NORTHWESTERLY FLOW REGIME WILL CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND WITH BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES NOTED EACH DAY. BY MONDAY...THERE WILL BE AN 
INCREASING CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY FOR NWRN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO SEVERAL 
IMPULSES MOVING DOWN IN THE MEAN FLOW...AS H5 TROUGH REMAINS 
ANCHORED OVER THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE COUNTRY. 

BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN MODERATING TOWARD MORE 
NORMAL LEVELS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE THROUGH...WITH RETURN 
FLOW SETTING UP. THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS

HAS BEEN AN ACTIVE SHIFT SO FAR...WITH COMPLEX OF ELEVATED STORMS 
DEVELOPING OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS. SOME STORMS HAVE BEEN STRONG 
ENOUGH TO PRODUCE HIGH WINDS...AND DOWNED TREES HAVE BEEN REPORTED 
IN IZARD...WOODRUFF...AND JACKSON COUNTIES...WITH SOME HAIL REPORTED 
IN IZARD COUNTY. SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES QUASI STATIONARY 
BOUNDARY OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS...EXTENDING INTO OKLAHOMA. 

ANOTHER...LARGER COMPLEX OF STORMS WAS ALSO NOTED IN NORTHERN 
OKLAHOMA AND SOUTHERN KANSAS...PROPAGATING SOUTHEASTWARD. BOTH 
COMPLEXES SHOULD DIE OFF LATER THIS MORNING. CONVECTION LIKELY TO 
RE-FIRE THIS AFTERNOON...AS REMNANTS OF BOTH COMPLEXES INTERACT WITH 
DAYTIME HEATING AND UPPER TROUGH MOVING THROUGH. COULD ONCE AGAIN 
SEE A FEW STRONG ELEVATED STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING 
CENTRAL AND SOUTH. 

ANTICIPATED CLOUD COVER AND RAINFALL WILL AFFECT TEMPERATURES 
TODAY...KEEPING READINGS IN THE LOWER 70S NORTH TO THE MID 80S 
SOUTH. PRECIPIATION MAY LINGER IN EXTREME SOUTHERN ARKANSAS ON 
THURSDAY MORNING BEFORE UPPER TROUGH SWEEPS REMAINING MOISTURE 
TOWARD THE GULF COAST. 

IN THE WAKE OF THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE...NORTHWESTERLY FLOW REGIME WILL 
SET UP OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH MUCH COOLER AIR IN PLACE. WEEK 
WILL END WITH TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL. MAY BE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN BY MONDAY...AS IMPULSES MOVE DOWN IN 
THE MEAN FLOW. THIS WOULD BE RESTRICTED PRIMARILY TO THE 
NORTHWESTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
FEW SHOWERS AND STORMS POPPING UP IN NORTHERN ARKANSAS THIS
AFTERNOON. SCATTERED PRECIPITATION WILL BE NOTED OVERNIGHT
IN ABOUT THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE STATE AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING
COLD FRONT. LOOKS QUIET IN THE SOUTH...AND ADDED NO RAIN AT THIS
TIME.

AFOREMENTIONED FRONT WILL RIDE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THROUGH
ARKANSAS ON WEDNESDAY. WILL BE LOTS OF CLOUDS...WITH
SCATTERED/NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MAIN ENERGY WITH FRONT
WILL REMAIN TO THE WEST IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH INDICATIONS OF
AN MCS IN CENTRAL/WESTERN OKLAHOMA. GIVEN THIS...REDUCED CHANCES OF
RAIN JUST A LITTLE AND LOWERED PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS.

FRONT WILL PUSH SOUTH OF THE STATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY...
WITH ANY LINGERING PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.
FRONT WILL BE FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER SHOT OF COOL AIR/CANADIAN
HIGH PRESSURE.

SHORT TERM PERIOD WILL END WITH QUIET CONDITIONS/LESS CLOUDS
AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. (46)
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...
MODELS SEEM TO BE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON WITH
REGARDS TO THE SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES. DIFFERENCES ARE IN THE
DETAILS IN BOTH TIMING AND INTENSITY BUT OVERALL PATTERN SEEMS
PRETTY CLEAR. WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS WITH A LEAN
TOWARDS THE MORE CONSISTENT GFS.

PERIOD STARTS OUT WITH HIGH AMPLITUDE FLOW THANKS TO STRONG RIDGE
OVER THE WESTERN CONUS AND DEEP TROF FROM THE EASTERN LAKES TO THE
GULF COAST. FLOW GRADUALLY FLATTENS OUT WITH TIME AS TROPICAL
SYSTEM MOVES FROM THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE UP THE EAST COAST AND
STRONG EASTERN PACIFIC STORM APPROACHES THE WASHINGTON COAST.

ON THE SURFACE...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE EARLY IN THE
PERIOD. THAT COMBINED WITH PERSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW...WILL KEEP
TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL AND DEW POINT TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER
50S TO MID 60S THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINTS WILL
BEGIN TO CREEP UP EARLY NEXT WEEK AS THE FLOW STARTS TO FLATTEN OUT
AND THE HIGH BEGINS TO DRIFT MORE TOWARDS THE EAST...ALLOWING FOR
MORE OF A SOUTHERLY FLOW. A FEW WEAK IMPULSES TRY TO MOVE ACROSS THE
AREA BUT MOISTURE WILL BE AT A PREMIUM AS THE GULF REMAINS CLOSED
THROUGH OUT THE PERIOD. NOT SEEING ANY PRECIPITATION AT THIS POINT
SO WILL GO WITH A DRY FORECAST THIS PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT
SOME CIRRUS BLOWOFF NOTED THIS MORNING OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS. THIS 
WAS COMING FROM LARGE MCS OVER WRN KS/NE. FRONTAL BOUNDARY CURRENTLY 
STALLED OVER SOUTHERN MISSOURI AND OK/KS BORDER. THIS WILL BEGIN 
MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD BY TONIGHT. 

LATEST SURFACE DATA INDICATES PATCHY FOG AT MANY LOCATIONS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...FOR THE MOST PART...VISBYS HAVENT DROPPED 
VERY LOW. WILL AT LEAST MENTION THE POSSIBILITY IN THE FORECAST 
FOR THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. THIS WILL MIX OUT AFTER SUNRISE. 

NEXT PRESSING ISSUE IS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY 
SAG SOUTHWARD BY TONIGHT. HOWEVER...MAJORITY OF THE MOISTURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM...AS WELL AS THE UPPER SUPPORT...WILL 
REMAIN POST-FRONTAL. THUS...BEST CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE LATE TONIGHT...AND INTO THE DAY WEDNESDAY AS 
THE FRONT MOVES INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS. HAVE GONE AHEAD AND RAISED 
POPS TO LIKELY AREAWIDE FOR MUCH OF WEDNESDAY. 

THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND RAINFALL WILL DEFINITELY HAVE SOME 
EFFECT ON TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY. TO WHAT DEGREE HOWEVER IS NOT  
EXACTLY CERTAIN. READINGS SHOULD ONLY REACH THE MID 70S NORTH TO THE 
MID 80S SOUTH. AS IVE SAID BEFORE THOUGH...THESE NUMBERS MAY BE A 
BIT HIGH. 

MCS WILL LIKELY BE ONGOING WEDNESDAY MORNING OVER ERN OKLAHOMA...
WITH REMNANTS MOVING INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS BY THE AFTERNOON. FRONT 
WILL ALSO BEGIN TO MOVE TOWARD SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AT THIS TIME. ANY 
DAYTIME HEATING WILL INTERACT WITH THE MCS REMNANTS AND WILL TOUCH 
OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF CONVECTION JUST IN TIME FOR THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. THIS WOULD BE MOST LIKELY OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS. 

THERE WILL BE A LINGERING CHANCE FOR RAIN OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS 
THROUGH MID DAY THURSDAY...AS MOISTURE REMAINS BEHIND THE FRONT. BY 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...H5 TROUGH WILL SWEEP THE MOISTURE ON OUT OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...WITH DRIER AND MUCH COOLER AIR FILTERING IN BEHIND. 

FOR THE FIRST TWO PERIODS...MOS GUIDANCE IS IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT. 
NOT SURPRISINGLY...THEY DIVERGE BEYOND THAT. COOLER ETA NUMBERS SEEM

MORE NOTEWORTHY IN THE EXTENDED PERIODS WILL BE THE PROLONGED PERIOD 
OF BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. LOWS WILL FALL INTO THE MID 50S TO MID 
60S...WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 70S TO MID 80S.

FEW SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED FROM CENTRAL INTO SOUTHWEST

ONE MORE SUMMERLIKE DAY ON STORE IN TUESDAY. SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL

TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE LATELY...FRONT WILL
NOT HAVE MUCH TROUBLE PLOWING THROUGH ARKANSAS...WITH MUCH COOLER
AIR AND POSSIBLY RECORD LOW TEMPERATURES TO END THE WEEK.

AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...
GFS THIS MORNING CONTINUES TO BE THE MORE CONSISTENT MODEL WITH THE 
ETA APPEARING TO PLAY CATCH UP. GFS ALSO THE STRONGER SOLUTION AND 
THE MOST AMPLIFIED AND SEEMS TO BE THE MORE REASONABLE CHOICE. 
REGARDLESS... PATTERN REMAINS ATYPICAL FOR EARLY AUGUST. THE ACTUAL 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS ARE NOT EXTREME BUT WILL STILL LEAN 
TOWARDS THE GFS SOLUTION.

PATTERN REMAINS HIGHLY AMPLIFIED FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. FLOW 
ATTEMPTS TO FLATTEN OUT SOMEWHAT DURING THE PERIOD BUT OVERALL 
PATTERN PERSISTS. UPPER LEVEL HIGH CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN NEW 
MEXICO SLOWLY RETROGRADES TO THE WEST AS DEEP TROF OVER THE EAST 
COAST LIFTS OUT. STRONG SHORTWAVE OFF THE WASHINGTON COAST WILL MOVE 
EASTWARD ALONG THE INTERNATIONAL BORDER. WAVE CARVES OUT A BROAD 
TROF OVER THE EASTERN CONUS WHILE RIDGING REESTABLISHES ITSELF OVER 
THE WEST COAST. OVERALL PATTERN KEEPS THE AREA IN NORTHWEST FLOW 
THROUGH THE PERIOD.

ON THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
EAST TO SOUTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES IN CHECK 
TODAY WITH DEW POINT TEMPERATURES REMAINING IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 
60S. CONVECTIVE DEBRIS FROM ACTIVITY IN TEXAS AND SOME AFTERNOON CU 
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN SHOULD JUST ABOUT DO IT FOR 
CLOUDS. CENTER OF THE HIGH SHIFTS EAST SUNDAY WITH SOME MODERATION  
IN BOTH TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINTS FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY BUT GULF 
REMAINS BASICALLY CLOSED. 

MODELS MOVE ANOTHER COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AFTERNOON 
THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. MOISTURE REMAINS LIMITED AND LIFTING IS 
NON EXISTENT. WITH DYNAMICS SORELY LACKING WILL DROP POPS DOWN TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY. DEEP MOISTURE REMAINS AT A PREMIUM WITH DEW 
POINTS STILL ONLY FORECAST TO CLIMB INTO THE UPPER 60S. WILL GO WITH 
A BLEND OF MAV/FWC NUMBERS THROUGH OUT THE PERIOD.
&&

LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
MODELS ARE IN REMARKABLY GOOD AGREEMENT IN THE MEDIUM RANGE AND 
CONTINUE THE AMPLIFIED PATTERN. BROAD TROF OVER THE EASTERN CONUS 
AT THE START OF THE PERIOD DEEPENS INTO A FULL LATITUDE TROF BY LATE 
FRIDAY WITH STRONG RIDGING OVER THE ROCKIES. NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
PREDOMINATES THROUGH OUT THE PERIOD AND ACTUALLY DEEPENS WITH TIME.

FRONT THAT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT STALLS OUT ACROSS CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN LOUISIANA FOR A FEW DAYS. SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW SCATTERED 
POPS SEEM WARRANTED TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WITH THE PROXIMITY OF 
THE FRONT. MODELS MOVE A SHORTWAVE ALONG THE BOUNDARY ON WEDNESDAY 
WITH DECENT MOISTURE RETURN. WILL GO HIGHER POPS HERE. HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS BACK INTO THE AREA LATE IN THE WEEK FOR ANOTHER SHOT OF 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO RUN BELOW NORMAL 
WITH MODELS HINTING AT A SECONDARY PUSH OF COOL AIR NEXT WEEKEND.

MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MORNING OVER THE MID SOUTH WITH 
THE SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES. ONLY NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE 
MODELS IS THE GFS DROPPING A SHORTWAVE DOWN IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW IN 
THE FRIDAY NIGHT TIME PERIOD. FEATURE HAS NO MOISTURE ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT AND SHOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON OUR SENSIBLE WEATHER. OTHERWISE 
FEEL A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS IS IN ORDER.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALONG THE GULF COAST 
AND FIRING UP CONVECTION OVER THE LOUISIANA COAST. DRIER AIR 
CONTINUES TO SINK SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE STATE. ISODROSOTHERM ANALYSIS 
SHOWS ROUGHLY A FIFTEEN DEGREE DEW POINT SPREAD FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. 
ALL MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUE TO SHOW DEW POINT TEMPERATURES SLOWLY 
DROPPING INTO THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S AND HOLDING STEADY THROUGH 
SUNDAY BEFORE SLOWLY STARTING TO CREEP UP AGAIN.

PATTERN OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL BE ANYTHING BUT TYPICAL FOR MID

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...
MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MORNING OVER THE MID SOUTH WITH 
THE SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES. ONLY NOTICEABLE DIFFERENCE IN THE 
MODELS IS THE GFS DROPPING A SHORTWAVE DOWN IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW IN 
THE FRIDAY NIGHT TIME PERIOD. FEATURE HAS NO MOISTURE ASSOCIATED 
WITH IT AND SHOULD HAVE NO IMPACT ON OUR SENSIBLE WEATHER. OTHERWISE 
FEEL A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS IS IN ORDER.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALONG THE GULF COAST 
AND FIRING UP CONVECTION OVER THE LOUISIANA COAST. DRIER AIR 
CONTINUES TO SINK SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE STATE. ISODROSOTHERM ANALYSIS 
SHOWS ROUGHLY A FIFTEEN DEGREE DEW POINT SPREAD FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. 
ALL MODEL GUIDANCE CONTINUE TO SHOW DEW POINT TEMPERATURES SLOWLY 
DROPPING INTO THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S AND HOLDING STEADY THROUGH 
SUNDAY BEFORE SLOWLY STARTING TO CREEP UP AGAIN.

PATTERN OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WILL BE ANYTHING BUT TYPICAL FOR MID 
AUGUST. UPPER LEVEL HIGH HAS SHIFTED INTO THE DESSERT SOUTHWEST...
ANCHORED ON BOTH SIDES BY UPPER LEVEL TROFS. RESULTANT PATTERN WILL 
KEEP NORTHWEST FLOW IN PLACE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. EAST COAST TROF

DRIER AIRMASS CONTS TO WORK SWD INTO AR THIS AFTN WITH LEADING EDGE 
NOW WORKING INTO CNTRL AR. HAVE SEEN SOME ISOLD SHRA FORM OVER CNTRL 
SECTIONS THE LAST FEW HOURS IN THE MORE HUMID AIRMASS AND WITH THE 
HELP OF THE H85 FRONT. MAY LEAVE SOME SMALL POPS OVER MY SRN ZNS FOR 
EARLY TNGT...BUT WILL WAIT UNTIL ISSUANCE TIME AND RADAR TRENDS FOR 
FINAL DECISION.

MODELS STILL IN GOOD AGREEMENT TODAY WITH FCST TRENDS THRU THE SHORT 
TERM. UPPER TROF OVER THE ERN STATES WILL RESULT IN CONTD NW FLOW 
ALOFT ACRS AR THRU THE WEEKEND. COOLER AND DRIER AIRMASS WILL ALSO 
TAKE HOLD THRU SAT AS SFC HIGH PRES SETTLES OVER THE MID-SOUTH. THIS 
WILL BE A GREAT BREAK FROM THE HEAT AND HUMIDITY WE WOULD NORMALLY 
EXPECT THIS TIME OF YEAR.

UPPER FLOW BEGINS TO FLATTEN OUT SOME LATER IN THE WEEKEND AS EAST 
COAST TROF LIFTS NEWD AND ANOTHER UPPER LOW MOVES ACRS THE NRN TIER 
OF THE COUNTRY. MEANWHILE...SFC RDG WILL WEAKEN SOMEWHAT BUT STILL 
INFLUENCE OUR WX TO CLOSE OUT THE WEEKEND. PLACE OF THE RDG WILL 
ALSO KEEP THE GULF CLOSED OFF IN REGARDS TO MOISTURE RETURN. TEMPS 
WILL SLOWLY MODERATE BY SUN AND RETURN TO MORE NORMAL LVLS AS SFC 
FLOW BECOMES MORE S-SELY OVER AR.
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
THE WEEK WILL START OUT WITH HIGH PRESSURE DEPARTING TO THE 
SOUTHEAST...WITH A WEAK COOL FRONT PUSHING THRU THE FA LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. DEWPOINTS WILL START OUT FAIRLY LOW 
MONDAY...ESPECIALLY FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...AND SOUTHERLY RETURN 
FLOW WILL NOT ESTABLISH ITSELF UNTIL MONDAY. GULF MOISTURE WILL BE 
CUT OFF FROM THE SYSTEM...WITH MOST OF THE MOISTURE BEHIND THE 
FRONT. THEREFORE...EXPECT MOST OF THE PRECIP TO BE POST FRONTAL.

FRONT MOVES THRU TUESDAY AND BECOMES STATIONARY NEAR THE AR-LA 
BORDER WESTWARD ALONG THE RED RIVER VALLEY. THIS FAR OUT IN THE 
FORECAST I AM NOT OVERLY CONFIDENT ON THE EXACT PLACEMENT OF THE 
FRONT...BUT GIVEN THE OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN THIS SUMMER...WOULD 
FAVOR A FURTHER SOUTH PUSH. BUT WENT AHEAD AND LEFT SMALL PRECIP 
CHANCES IN THROUGH WEDNESDAY TO CONVEY REDUCED CONFIDENCE.

HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS OFF TO THE EAST AGAIN LATE WEDNESDAY...SETTING 
OUT MORE SOUTHERLY WINDS. STATIONARY FRONT WILL RESPOND TO THIS AND 
MOVE NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT. PUT SLIGHT CHANCES FOR PRECIP IN 
MAINLY FRIDAY AS FRONT LIFTS THRU FA.

AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES GO...TEMPS WILL CONT WARMING FROM THE COOL 
WEEKEND READINGS. WILL HAVE TO MONITOR TEMPS FOR TUESDAY...IF MAIN

TONIGHT...WHILE AN ISOLATED ONE IS NOT TOTALLY OUT OF THE

HOWEVER...SFC DEWPOINTS IN THE MID AND UPPER 70S ARE PRODUCING HEAT 
INDICES AROUND ADVY CRITERIA. WILL LET ADVY EXPIRE WITH THIS FCST 
ISSUANCE. 

LATEST SFC DATA SHOWS CDFNT EXTENDS FROM SWRN MO BACK INTO NWRN OK. 
BNDRY HAS BEEN MOVING A BIT SLOWER THAN PROGS INDCD BUT EXPECT IT TO 
SPEED UP THIS EVENING AND WORK INTO NWRN AR. AREA RADARS ARE QUIET 
ATTM...BUT LATEST RUC STILL SHOWING SCTD SHRA/TSRA FORMING BY THIS 
EVENING ALONG THE FNT AS UPPER SUPPORT ARRIVES AND CAP ERRODES.

MENTIONED SCTD POPS TNGT ALONG AND AHEAD OF CDFNT. LEFT SOME 
LINGERING SLIGHT CHC POPS IN FOR SERN AR THU MRNG ALONG DEPARTING 
FNT. OTHERWISE...MUCH DRIER AIR WILL GRADUALLY FILTER IN ON NWLY 
WINDS THU AFTN AND NIGHT.

MODELS STILL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH OVERALL TRENDS IN THE LATER PDS. 
UPPER HIGH WILL CONT TO RETROGRADE WWD AND A SIG UPPER TROF WILL 
FORM OVER THE ERN PART OF THE NATION. RESULTANT NWLY FLOW ALOFT ACRS 
AR WILL PUSH LATEST CDFNT WELL S OF THE FA BY LATE IN THE WEEK. BLO 
NORMAL TEMPS AND MUCH DRIER AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND FROPA AND 
PERSIST INTO SAT.

SFC HIGH PRES SLIPS E OF THE FA OVER THE WEEKEND...ALLOWING RETURN 
FLOW TO SET UP AND A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL TEMPS. NWLY FLOW ALOFT 
WILL PREVAIL BUT LITTLE IN THE WAY OF UPPER ENERGY TO SUPPORT RAIN 
CHCS INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

THE NEXT CDFNT IS PROGGED TO AFFECT AR TUE AND WED...WHICH AGAIN IS 
A LITTLE SLOWER THAN YESTERDAY/S DATA INDCD. HAVE PLACED CHC POPS IN 
FOR DAY 6 AND 7 WITH FROPA. GOING FCST TEMP TRENDS IN THE EXTENDED

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. SUNNY SKIES 
WERE OVER MOST OF THE AREA. A FEW CLOUDS WERE SEEN ON SATELLITE 
IMAGES MOVING INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS DUE TO A PERSISTENT MCS THAT 
REFUSES TO DISSIPATE. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN FOR 
THE NORTHEAST SECTION THIS EVENING. 

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH KEEPING HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE 
AREA THROUGH TUESDAY. A COLD FRONT IN THE MIDWEST WILL APPROACH THE 
NORTH LATE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. WILL BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE NORTH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...AND 
CENTRAL AND SOUTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE 
STATE BY FRIDAY. WILL KEEP FRIDAY DRY AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES BACK 
INTO THE AREA. CROSS SECTIONS SHOW VERY DRY AIR ALOFT MOVING INTO 
THE AREA FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY
GFS AND CANADIAN MODELS CONSISTENT WITH HIGH PRESSURE MOVING IN FOR 
THE WEEKEND. GIVEN RECENT EVENTS...HAVE TROUBLE BELIEVING FRONT WILL 
PUSH THRU MY CWA. GFS IS ADVERTISING DRY AIR TO MOVE IN BEHIND THE 
FRONT...WHILE THE FRONT ITSELF STALLS ACROSS NORTHERN LA INTO 
EASTERN OK. WHILE THE DRY AIR MAY BE OVERDONE A BIT...WONT ARGUE 
WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FOR SATURDAY. WILL SEE AFTERNOON CU LIKELY 
DEVELOP. GFS IS HINTING AT A SHORTWAVE RIDING THE RIDGE INTO THE 
CWFA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. PUT SMALL PRECIP CHANCES IN 
TO COINCIDE WITH THE SHORT WAVE PASSAGE. OTHERWISE...DIURNAL CLOUDS 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY AFTERNOONS. FOR TEMPS...THINKING THAT WITH DRY 
COOL AIR MOVING IN SATURDAY...THINKING THAT HIGH TEMPS WILL BE A BIT 
BELOW GUIDANCE. DONT WANT TO GO ABNORMALLY COOL YET...BUT WILL HAVE 
TO MONITOR AS DAY APPROACHES. HIGH SHIFTS EAST LATE SUN/EARLY MON

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. SUNNY SKIES 
WERE OVER MOST OF THE AREA. A FEW CLOUDS WERE SEEN ON SATELLITE 
IMAGES MOVING INTO NORTHEAST ARKANSAS DUE TO A PERSISTENT MCS THAT 
REFUSES TO DISSIPATE. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN FOR 
THE NORTHEAST SECTION THIS EVENING. 

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH KEEPING HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE 
AREA THROUGH TUESDAY. A COLD FRONT IN THE MIDWEST WILL APPROACH THE 
NORTH LATE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. WILL BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE NORTH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...AND 
CENTRAL AND SOUTH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH THE 
STATE BY FRIDAY. WILL KEEP FRIDAY DRY AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES BACK 
INTO THE AREA. CROSS SECTIONS SHOW VERY DRY AIR ALOFT MOVING INTO 
THE AREA FRIDAY.   
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY
GFS AND CANADIAN MODELS CONSISTENT WITH HIGH PRESSURE MOVING IN FOR 
THE WEEKEND. GIVEN RECENT EVENTS...HAVE TROUBLE BELIEVING FRONT WILL 
PUSH THRU MY CWA. GFS IS ADVERTISING DRY AIR TO MOVE IN BEHIND THE 
FRONT...WHILE THE FRONT ITSELF STALLS ACROSS NORTHERN LA INTO 
EASTERN OK. WHILE THE DRY AIR MAY BE OVERDONE A BIT...WONT ARGUE 
WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FOR SATURDAY. WILL SEE AFTERNOON CU LIKELY 
DEVELOP. GFS IS HINTING AT A SHORTWAVE RIDING THE RIDGE INTO THE 
CWFA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. PUT SMALL PRECIP CHANCES IN 
TO COINCIDE WITH THE SHORT WAVE PASSAGE. OTHERWISE...DIURNAL CLOUDS 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY AFTERNOONS. FOR TEMPS...THINKING THAT WITH DRY 
COOL AIR MOVING IN SATURDAY...THINKING THAT HIGH TEMPS WILL BE A BIT 
BELOW GUIDANCE. DONT WANT TO GO ABNORMALLY COOL YET...BUT WILL HAVE 
TO MONITOR AS DAY APPROACHES. HIGH SHIFTS EAST LATE SUN/EARLY MON 
WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNING...WHICH WILL PUT AN END TO THE COOL 
WEATHER.

HIGH PRESSURE SURFACE/ALOFT WILL BRING HOT WEATHER...ESPECIALLY
HEADING INTO TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY. NOT MANY CLOUDS...AND DEWPOINTS
IN THE LOWER 70S WILL NET HEAT INDICES FROM 105 TO 110 DEGREES
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS BOTH DAYS...AND HEAT ADVISORY LIKELY
TO BE ISSUED. DEWPOINTS NOT QUITE HIGH ENOUGH/TEMPERATURES NOT
QUITE WARM ENOUGH TO WARRANT HEAT ADVISORY TODAY.

HIGH WILL RETROGRADE TOWARD SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES FROM MID TO
LATE WEEK. THIS WILL ALLOW A COLD FRONT TO PUSH INTO THE REGION FROM
THE NORTH LATE WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY. LATEST DATA INDICATING THAT
FRONT WILL MAKE IT THROUGH STATE BEFORE STALLING JUST TO THE
SOUTHWEST. SHOULD THIS HAPPEN...SLIGHTLY COOLER WEATHER WILL BE
NOTED BY THIS WEEKEND. GIVEN TRACK RECORD LATELY...WOULD THINK
THAT EXPECTED SCENARIO WILL PAN OUT.

MOISTURE SURROUNDING FRONT NOT ALL THAT DEEP...SO WOULD THINK
THAT ONLY ISOLATED/SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AS FRONT
PUSHES THROUGH. HAVE INDICATED AS SUCH IN THE FORECAST. (46)

FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS ARE NOTED ON SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON 
ACROSS THE AREA. CLOUDS WILL DISSIPATE AT SUNSET WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE AREA. 

HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CENTER PART OF THE COUNTRY WILL CONTINUE TO 
BRING WARM HUMID AIR TO THE AREA FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. CROSS 
SECTIONS SHOW PLENTY OF DRY AIR IN THE UPPER LEVELS THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT. A COLD FRONT IN THE MIDWEST 
WILL MAKE ITS WAY TOWARD THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. AS THE 
CENTER OF THE HIGH SLIDES TO THE WEST A BIT ON WEDNESDAY...WILL 
BRING PRECP CHANCES BACK INTO THE NORTH. THE FRONT WILL APPROACH 
FROM THE NORTHEAST AND WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA. THE 
FRONT WILL STILL BE ACROSS THE AREA FOR MUCH OF NEXT WEEKEND...AND 
ALLOW SMALL CHANCES OF PRECIP TO CONTINUE. 

THE MIDDLE PART OF THE WEEK WILL BE THE HOTTEST WITH THE LARGE RIDGE 
OVER THE AREA. HEAT INDICES LOOK TO BE BORDERLINE TO ADVISORY 
CRITERIA IN THE SOUTH MONDAY BUT WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY ADVISORY AT 
THIS TIME. WILL LIKELY MEET ADVISORY CRITERIA DURING THE MIDDLE PART

MADE IT INTO THE LZK CWFA HOWEVER. 

HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO MOVE IN FROM THE WEST. CROSS SECTIONS 
SHOW VERY DRY AIR IN THE UPPER LEVELS ESPECIALLY AFTER TONIGHT. THE 
ONLY CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION TONIGHT WILL BE IN THE SOUTHEAST NEAR 
THE COLD FRONT AND WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE THERE THROUGH THIS 
EVENING. THE COLD FRONT HAS STALLED NEAR THE LOUISIANA BORDER BUT 
SHOULD BEGIN MOVING SOUTH AGAIN TONIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE WORKS INTO 
THE AREA. MOST AREAS WILL BE DRY ON SUNDAY. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF PRECIP ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE CWFA. 

HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY AIR WILL KEEP PRECIP CHANCES NEAR ZERO FOR 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY. WILL BRING SLIGHT CHANCES BACK INTO THE 
NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AS A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT MOVES INTO 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS FROM THE GREAT LAKES. THIS WILL WEAKEN THE RIDGE 
AND BRING PRECIP CHANCES BACK INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE NORMAL TO ABOVE NORMAL THIS WEEK.

THE COLD FRONT AND WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE THERE THROUGH THIS 
EVENING. THE COLD FRONT HAS STALLED NEAR THE LOUISIANA BORDER BUT 
SHOULD BEGIN MOVING SOUTH AGAIN TONIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE WORKS INTO 
THE AREA. MOST AREAS WILL BE DRY ON SUNDAY. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF PRECIP ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE CWFA. 

HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY AIR WILL KEEP PRECIP CHANCES NEAR ZERO FOR 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY. WILL BRING SLIGHT CHANCES BACK INTO THE 
NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AS A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT MOVES INTO 
NORTHEAST ARKANSAS FROM THE GREAT LAKES. THIS WILL WEAKEN THE RIDGE 
AND BRING PRECIP CHANCES BACK INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE NORMAL TO ABOVE NORMAL THIS WEEK.

PATCHY FOG CONTINUES TO FORM WITH DENSE FOG OVER AREAS TO MY NORTH

THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WHICH BROUGHT SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL TO MOST OF 
ARKANSAS YESTERDAY WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS ARKANSAS 
TODAY. THE MEAN RH CONTINUES SOMEWHAT HIGHER OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN 
ONE THIRD OF ARKANSAS AND THIS MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR SMALL POPS 
TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF MY CWA. 
THE LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS REVEALS A BOUNDARY FROM NEAR KJBR TO 
NEAR KTXK WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 70S ALONG AND TO THE SOUTHEAST 
OF THIS LINE. RELATIVELY COOLER AND DRIER AIR IS FOUND IN THE 
NORTHWESTERN SECTIONS. THIS DRIER AIR WILL EVENTUALLY SPREAD TO THE

OF MAIN CONCERN ARE POPS AND RAINFALL AMOUNTS FOR TODAY. WILL GO 
WITH THE SUGGESTED CONCENSUS OF MODELS. THE LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE
LOOPS REVEAL A CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT WITH COLD TOPS OVER NORTHEASTERN
TEXAS AND HEADED TOWARDS ARKANSAS. SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO MOVE ACROSS CENTRAL 
AND EASTERN ARKANSAS. ACTIVITY WILL BE LESS NUMEROUS OVER THE WESTERN
SECTIONS. BY THIS AFTERNOON...THE POPS WILL DECREASE OVER MOST 
SECTIONS...THE EXTREME EAST COULD BE THE EXCEPTION DEPENDING ON THE 
SPEED OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROF. A TRAIN ECHO EFFECT WITH SHOWERS 
MOVING OVER THE SAME GENERAL AREA IS POSSIBLE AND SOME AREAS OF 
CENTRAL AND EASTERN ARKANSAS MAY SEE HEAVY RAINFALL AMOUNTS TODAY SO 
THIS SITUATIOJN WILL BE MONITORED CLOSELY FOR PONDING OF WATER.   
BY EARLY SATURDAY AN UPPER LEVEL HIGH WILL DEVELOP TO OUR WEST AND A
MORE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL PREVAIL OVER ARKANSAS WHICH WILL BRING
A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES...EACH CAPABLE OF A FEW SHOWERS. GFS TEMPS
SEEM REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM THESE.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

250 AM CDT FRI JUL 30 2004

.DISCUSSION...
OF MAIN CONCERN ARE POPS AND RAINFALL AMOUNTS FOR TODAY. WILL GO 
WITH THE SUGGESTED CONCENSUS OF MODELS. THE LATEST INFRARED SATELLITE
LOOPS REVEAL A CONTINUED DEVELOPMENT WITH COLD TOPS OVER NORTHEASTERN
TEXAS AND HEADED TOWARDS ARKANSAS. SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS CAN BE EXPECTED THIS MORNING TO MOVE ACROSS CENTRAL 
AND EASTERN ARKANSAS. ACTIVITY WILL BE LESS NUMEROUS OVER THE WESTERN
SECTIONS. BY THIS AFTERNOON...THE POPS WILL DECREASE OVER MOST 
SECTIONS...THE EXTREME EAST COULD BE THE EXCEPTION DEPENDING ON THE 
SPEED OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROF. A TRAIN ECHO EFFECT WITH SHOWERS 
MOVING OVER THE SAME GENERAL AREA IS POSSIBLE AND SOME AREAS OF 
CENTRAL AND EASTERN ARKANSAS MAY SEE HEAVY RAINFALL AMOUNTS TODAY SO 
THIS SITUATIOJN WILL BE MONITORED CLOSELY FOR PONDING OF WATER.   
BY EARLY SATURDAY AN UPPER LEVEL HIGH WILL DEVELOP TO OUR WEST AND A
MORE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL PREVAIL OVER ARKANSAS WHICH WILL BRING
A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES...EACH CAPABLE OF A FEW SHOWERS. GFS TEMPS
SEEM REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM THESE.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
UPPER TROF WILL SLOWLY APPROACH THE AREA FROM OKLAHOMA TONIGHT AND 
FRIDAY THEN THE TROF WILL HANG OVER THE AREA FOR MUCH OF THE WEEKEND.
WEAK SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA TONIGHT AND FRIDAY THEN 
MOVE OFF TO THE EAST. LITTLE GRADIENT INDICATED WHICH SUGGESTS SURFACE
AND LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BE RATHER LIGHT AND VARIABLE WITH NO STRONG
INFLOW FROM THE GULF. HOWEVER UPPER TROF AND SOME DIFFLUENCE ALONG
WITH PRECIP WATER OF 2 INCHES OR MORE WILL RESULT IN SOME HEAVY 
RAINS. AREA HAS NOT BEEN TOO WET RECENTLY SO FLASH FLOOD CONCERNS 
NOT GREAT BUT ISOLATED AREAS WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED FOR TRAINING
OF HEAVY RAINFALL. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS IN THE WEST TONIGHT DECREASING
TO THE EAST THEN SHIFT TO HIGHER POPS IN THE EAST BY FRIDAY AS THE 
UPPER SYSTEM SLOWLY SHIFTS EAST. WILL LOWER POPS FROM THE WEST LATE 
FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH SMALL POPS THROUGH SUNDAY SINCE THE UPPER 
TROF WILL BE HANGING IN THE AREA WITH WARM HUMID AIR MASS IN PLACE. 
MIN TEMPS SHOULD BE AROUND NORMAL THE NEXT FEW NIGHTS WHILE MAXES FRIDAY
WILL LIKELY BE HELD A LITTLE BELOW MOS BY CLOUDS. MAXES CLOSER TO NORMAL
SHOULD SET IN SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS AIR MASS DIRES OUT A LITTLE. 
WILL GO A LITTLE BELOW MOS ON SATURDAY.    
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
MODELS STAY CONSISTENT WITH THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY MOVING EAST OF ARKANSAS BY SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS ALONG WITH THE 
EXPANDING MID LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE OVER NEW MEXICO WILL DECREASE 
CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION. HOWEVER...GFS IS SHOWING A SHORT WAVE 
MOVING THROUGH THE NORTHWEST FLOW AND MORE OF THESE COULD AFFECT 
ARKANSAS. THEREFORE WILL CONTINUE SMALL POPS THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD. WARMER TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN BY MONDAY...AND WILL BE 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
FORECAST IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGING ONE YET AGAIN. SCATTERED LIGHT 
SHOWERS HAVE BEEN MOVING INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS AND NORTHERN ARKANSAS 
FOR THE LAST SIX TO EIGHT HOURS OR SO. SURFACE REPORTS HAVE 
INDICATED THAT SOME OF IT IS REACHING THE GROUND. HOWEVER...LOOKING 
AT KLZK SOUNDING FROM 00Z...SURFACE TO 850 MB LEVEL IS STILL PRETTY 
DRY...SO MUCH OF THE PRECIP HAS EVAPORATED BEFORE REACHING THE 
GROUND. 

TAKING A LOOK AT THE LATEST SURFACE DATA THIS MORNING...SURFACE 
RIDGE...ALBEIT WEAKENING...IS STILL IN PLACE OVER THE MID 
MISSISSIPPI/OHIO VALLEY. WARM FRONT CURRENTLY OVER NORTH TEXAS..AND 
HEADING NORTHWARD. SATELLITE PICS AND SURFACE REPORTS INDICATE THICK 
CIRRUS...ALONG WITH ALTOCU BLOWING OFF FROM AREA OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH TEXAS. 

THE AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER NORTH TEXAS WILL WEAKEN 
LATER ON THIS MORNING...AS THE ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT SLOWLY MOVES 
NORTHWARD...AND SHORTWAVE PROGRESSES EASTWARD FROM WEST TEXAS. MODEL 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED ONCE AGAIN THIS MORNING...WITH THE GFS TAKING 
MAIN AXIS OF MOISTURE RIGHT INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS BY MID DAY TODAY. 
GIVEN THAT THE SURFACE RIDGE HAS BEEN SLOWER TO BREAK DOWN...AND 
POSITION OF THE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY...PREFER THE 
ETA/RUC SOLUTION...WHICH TAKES THE MAIN MOISTURE SWATH NORTHWARD 
TOWARD OKLAHOMA BY MID DAY...AND THEN EASTWARD AS THE RIDGE BREAKS 
DOWN AND MOVES AWAY. THIS WOULD PUT THE GREATEST RAIN CHANCES IN 
WESTERN ARKANSAS LATE THIS AFTERNOON...AND OVER THE WEST AND CENTRAL 
TONIGHT. 

PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE RATHER HIGH TONIGHT AND ON 
FRIDAY...GENERALLY ONE TO TWO INCHES. DIVERGENCE ALOFT WILL BE 
PRESENT OVER WESTERN AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS...WITH UPPER JET KICKING 
IN. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE SOME PLACES MAINLY IN WESTERN 
ARKANSAS RECEIVING AS MUCH AS ONE TO TWO INCHES OF RAIN IN THE NEXT 
24 TO 36 HOURS. FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES ARE RELATIVELY HIGH...SO 
AM NOT EXPECTING FLOODING PROBLEMS AT THIS TIME.

WILL STILL BE A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN ON FRIDAY...AS SURFACE LOW AND 
SHORTWAVE MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WITH H5 RIDGE 
STRENTGTHENING OVER THE SOUTHEAST...STILL LOOKS PROBABLE THAT 
BOUNDARY ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE LOW WILL STALL OUT INVOF 
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS BY SATURDAY...WITH NORTHWESTERLY FLOW SETTING UP 
BEHIND IT. THOUGH MOISTURE WILL DECREASE BY THE WEEKEND...HAVE STILL 
LEFT SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE 
FEATURES. 

TEMPERATURE FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM IS GOING TO BE TRICKY...ON 
ACCOUNT OF CLOUD COVER AND ANTICIPATED RAINFALL. LIKE THE COOLER MAV 
NUMBERS FOR THE INITIAL PERIODS. GUIDANCE FALLS MORE IN LINE TOWARD 
THE END OF THE SHORT TERM...BRINGING READINGS BACK TO NEAR CLIMO. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
EXTENDED RANGE SOLUTIONS STILL HOLD H5 TROUGH OVER THE LOWER AND MID 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THROUGH MUCH OF THE EXTENDED PERIODS. WITH THIS 
FEATURE IN PLACE...AND NORTHWESTERLY FLOW REGIME CONTINUING THROUGH 
THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK...WILL KEEP SMALL CHANCES OF RAIN IN 
THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY. BY THEN...H5 RIDGE WILL BEGIN BUILDING 
INTO ARKANSAS FROM THE PLAINS...SHUTTING OFF RAIN CHANCES. RETURN 
FLOW WILL SET UP...AND TEMPERATURES WILL WARM BACK INTO THE LOWER

WITH UPPER RIDGING STILL OVER THE AREA THOUGH HEIGHTS ARE ANEMIC FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR. BEST RETURN FLOW ACROSS THE PLAINS THIS MORNING

305 AM CDT WED JUL 28 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
THIS FORECAST IS GOING TO BE A CHALLENGING ONE IN THE SHORT TERM. 
MODEL SOLUTIONS ARE NOT IN GOOD AGREEMENT. BIGGEST CHALLENGE IS 
GOING TO BE TIMING OF WX/PRECIP.

LATEST SURFACE DATA SHOWS STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY INVOF THE GULF 
COAST. RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI/WRN OHIO 
VALLEY. LASTLY...SHORTWAVE ENTERING NORTHWEST TEXAS/WRN OKLAHOMA. 

CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWING ENCROACHING ALTOCU AND CIRRUS FROM 
SYSTEM OUT IN WEST TEXAS. SOME STRATOCU ALSO NOTED IN CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS...WITH CIGS OF 050-060 AT KHOT AND KRUE. THE 
INCREASING CLOUD COVER TODAY WILL HELP KEEP READINGS IN WESTERN 
ARKANSAS IN CHECK. THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL SEE 
THE HIER READINGS...FLIRTING WITH THE UPPER 80S.

HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND H5 LEVELS WILL MOVE OFF TO THE EAST 
TODAY. MOISTURE WILL BEGIN ADVECTING NORTHWARD AS WELL...WITH 
INCREASING CLOUDINESS NOTED. STALLED BOUNDARY WILL BEGIN MOVING 
NORTHWARD LATER TODAY. AT THE SAME TIME...SHORTWAVE OVER TEXAS WILL 
BE MOVING TOWARD THE AREA. 

NOW COMES THE TRICKY PART. IT ALL DEPENDS ON WHICH MODEL SOLUTION 
YOU BUY INTO. GFS...WHICH SEEMS TO HAVE FEEDBACK ISSUES THIS 
MORNING...IS BY FAR THE MOST AGGRESSIVE...BRINGING RAIN INTO THE 
WESTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 18Z...AND COMPLETELY 
COVERING THE AREA BY 12Z THURSDAY...WITH ALMOST A 3 INCH PRECIP 
BULLSEYE IN THE ARKLATEX REGION. 

THE ETA SOLUTION SHOWS A STRONGER H5 RIDGE...WHICH BLOCKS 
SIGNIFICANT FORWARD PROGRESSION OF THE SHORTWAVE AND SURFACE 
SYSTEM...UNTIL WELL INTO THURSDAY. IF THIS SCENARIO WERE TO PAN 
OUT...ONSET OF PRECIP WOULD LIKELY NOT BE UNTIL LATE THURSDAY 
MORNING. 

FEEL AT THIS POINT...THE BEST COURSE OF ACTION WILL BE TO CONTINUE A 
FORECAST THAT IS FASTER THAN THE ETA...BUT NOT NEARLY AS AGGRESSIVE 
AS THE GFS. WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER THE EXTREME WEST 
TODAY...AND CHANCE POPS OVER ABOUT THE WESTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE 
AREA TONIGHT. BEST CHANCES WILL BE ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT 
OVER THE WEST...AS THE SHORTWAVE ADVANCES INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS. 
MAIN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS ON FRIDAY. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW 
WILL THEN SET UP OVER THE AREA...WITH MORE SYSTEMS LIKELY TO AFFECT 
THE AREA INTO THE WEEKEND. SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL MOVE INTO FORECAST 
AREA ON FRIDAY...AND MAY STALL OR WASH OUT NEAR SOUTHERN OR EASTERN 
ARKANSAS. 

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...MOS GUIDANCE IS ALL OVER THE PLACE. 
BASICALLY...HAVE GONE WARMER THAN THE GFS...AND NOT NEARLY AS HOT AS 
THE ETA. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
NO MAJOR CHANGES HAVE BEEN MADE TO THE GOING EXTENDED FORECAST. 
EXTENDED RANGE SOLUTIONS HOLD BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER THE AREA FOR 
MUCH OF THE EXTENDED PERIODS. WITH NORTHWESTERLY FLOW...NOT TO 
MENTION WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY INVOF SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA...WILL 
CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE POPS IN THE EXTENDED. EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN WARMING BACK INTO THE 90S.

MOSTLY CLR SKIES OVERNIGHT. LOOKING AT ONE MORE COOL NIGHT FOR LATE 
JULY WITH LOWS DIPPING INTO THE 50S AND 60S WITH SOME RECORD LOWS IN

WARMEST READINGS EXPECTED IN ERN SECTIONS.

UPPER TROF MOVES CLOSER TO AR FROM THE PLAINS WED NIGHT AND THU...
RESULTING IN BETTER RAIN CHCS. HAVE CONTD THE FCST MORE TOWARDS THE

UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONT FRI AND FRI NIGHT AS SEVERAL

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME STRATOCU OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS AND IN THE 
ARKANSAS RIVER VALLEY...MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA HAS CLEARED OUT 
THIS MORNING. WINDS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN LESS THAN 5 MPH. BOUNDARY 
LAYER RH IS FAIRLY HIGH...AND THIS HAS ALLOWED PATCHY FOG TO FORM. 
VISBYS WITH THE FOG HAVE MOSTLY BEEN IN THE 3-6SM RANGE. THE FOG 
SHOULD DISPERSE AROUND MID MORNING. 

RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CURRENTLY PUSHING INTO ARKANSAS FROM THE MID 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS WILL ALLOW MOSTLY SUNNY/CLEAR CONDITIONS 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE OUT OF THE NORTHEAST/
EAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND AS A RESULT TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE 
TO BE BELOW NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. FOR TODAY...GOING FOR 
LOWER TO MID 80S NORTH AND CENTRAL...AND UPPER 80S SOUTH. TONIGHT...
TEMPERATURES WILL BE BACK DOWN IN THE UPPER 50S NORTH TO MID 60S 
SOUTH. 

ON WEDNESDAY...THE WARMUP BEGINS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE OFF TOWARD 
THE EAST...AND AS A RESULT...WINDS WILL TAKE ON MORE OF A SOUTHERLY 
COMPONENT. TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB BACK UP TO THE MID 80S TO LOWER 
90S. 

AS THE RIDGE HEADS TO THE EAST...A SHORTWAVE WILL BE MOVING DOWN OFF 
THE ROCKIES. THIS...COMBINED WITH REMNANTS OF THIS PAST WEEKENDS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY HEADING NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF COAST...WILL BRING 
ABOUT THE NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN FOR THE AREA. MODELS ARE DISAGREEING 
ON PLACEMENT OF THESE TWO SYSTEMS. AT 12Z THURSDAY...THE GFS HAS THE 
SHORTWAVE OVER CENTRAL OKLAHOMA...WHEREAS THE ETA LAGS THE GFS...
WITH THE MAIN SYSTEM ONLY IN THE PANHANDLES BY THEN. 

SINCE THE OVERALL TREND HAS BEEN TO SLOW THE SYSTEM DOWN...WILL GO 
WITH A FORECAST THAT IS LESS AGGRESSIVE THAN THE GFS...BUT NOT AS 
SLOW AS THE ETA. AM BRINGING IN RAIN CHANCES TO THE FAR WESTERN PTN 
OF THE AREA LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...AND OVER THE ENTIRE AREA 
BEFORE DAWN ON THURSDAY MORNING. 

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...MOS IS IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREMENT FOR ABOUT THE 
FIRST THREE OR SO PERIODS. BY THE FIFTH PERIOD /THURSDAY/...GUIDANCE 
DIFFERS ANYWHERE FROM 4 TO 8 DEGREES...WITH THE ETA BEING THE 
WARMEST. TENDED TO GRAVITATE MORE TOWARD THE GFS MOS...BUT JUST A 
FEW DEGREES WARMER. 
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY
BY FRIDAY...SURFACE SYSTEM AND H5 TROUGH SHOULD BE NEARLY IN PHASE 
WITH EACH OTHER OVER WESTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA. LATEST 
MEX GUIDANCE IS GOING FOR 70 POPS ON FRIDAY...BUT GIVEN THE WAY THE 
MODELS HAVE SLOWED THIS SYSTEM DOWN...AND ALL THIS BEING OUT IN DAY 
4...AM A BIT HESITANT TO GO WITH ANY HIGHER THAN CHANCE POPS. 

BY FRIDAY NIGHT...SURFACE SYSTEM SHOULD HANG UP SOMEWHERE IN THE 
VICINITY OF SOUTHERN/EASTERN ARKANSAS. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL SET 
UP BEHIND THE STALLED SYSTEM. WITH SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS 
MOVING DOWN IN THE MEAN FLOW...LEFT AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN

.DISCUSSION...
DOPPLER RADAR SHOWS PATCHY LIGHT RAIN IN PARTS OF THE AREA AND PATCHES
OF LIGHT RAIN MOVING INTO WESTERN SECTIONS FROM OKLAHOMA. THIS LIKELY
AHEAD OF THE SHORT WAVE THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA LATER TODAY. 
UPDATED TO PUT IN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA THIS
MORNING AND CONTINUED THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE SOUTHEAST 
THIS AFTERNOON. UPDATED CLOUD GRIDS TO INCREASE CLOUDS THIS MORNING
BUT STILL INDICATE SOME CLEARING DURING THE AFTERNOON. TEMP GRIDS
ALTERED SOME TO SHOW SLOWER WARMING THIS MORNING BUT MAX FORECASTS
WERE LEFT UNCHANGED. 

.PREV DISCUSSION...
.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY
UNSEASONABLY COOL AIR HAS DESCENDED ON THE AREA AS THE COLD FRONT HAS
SHIFTED TO THE SOUTH AND A COOL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES IN FROM 
THE NORTH. LOW CLOUDS COVER THE AREA AND THEY WILL LIKELY TAKE MOST
OF THE DAY TO MOVE OUT AS THE UPPER TROF WILL NOT PASS OVER THE AREA
UNTIL TONIGHT. PATCHY RAIN HAS BEEN CONFINED TO SOUTHEASTERN SECTIONS
THIS MORNING AND WILL KEEP SMALL POPS GOING IN THE SOUTHEAST FOR 
MUCH OF THE DAY. ISOLATED LIGHT RAIN HAS BEEN INDICATED TO THE WEST
OF THE AREA THIS MORNING AND CANNOT RULE OUT SOME ISOLATED PATCHES
OF LIGHT RAIN ELSEWHERE TODAY...BUT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT MERITS
20 POPS BUT DID PUT 5 TO 10 POPS IN THE GRIDS. TEMPS WILL STRUGGLE 
TO RISE TODAY AND MOS MAY BE A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC BUT THINK THE 
INTENSE SUN WILL BREAK THE CLOUDS ENOUGH FOR SOME HEATING AND 
IT HAS MANAGED TO WARM UP SOMEWHAT IN MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS 
THIS SUMMER AT MANY STATIONS. CLOUDS SHOULD CLEAR OUT EARLY TONIGHT
WITH THE UPPER TROF MOVING PAST THE AREA THEN A SURFACE HIGH WILL
MOVE NEAR THE AREA. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN GOOD COOLING TONIGHT AND
TUESDAY NIGHT WITH MINS REACHING THE 50S IN THE NORTH AND WELL DOWN
INTO THE 60S IN OTHER AREAS. TUESDAY SHOULD BE A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY
AND TEMPS SHOULD REBOUND ACCORDINGLY WITH MOST AREAS IN THE LOWER TO 
MID 80S. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE BEHIND THE SURFACE HIGH AND 
ANOTHER UPPER TROF WILL APPROACH STARTING ON WEDNESDAY. THE TROF
MOVES VERY SLOWLY AND IT LOOKS LIKE THE HIGH PRESSURE WILL HOLD
THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS CONTINUING AND 
MAXES MOVING UP A LITTLE AGAIN. THE TROF STARTS TO AFFECT THE 
AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS. 
KEPT POPS IN STARTING THURSDAY. 
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
UPPER TROF WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AND THAT LOOKS
LIKE THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN RIGHT NOW. WENT WITH CHANCE POPS ON 
FRIDAY AND SLIGHT CHANCE THE REST OF THE TIME THROUGH SATURDAY. 
KEPT TEMP FORECASTS ABOUT THE SAME WITH READINGS NEAR NORMAL. IF
THE SCENARIO FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY DOES MATERIALIZE...MAXES MAY 
NEED TO BE TRIMMED DOWN A LITTLE.

.DISCUSSION...
MAIN AREA OF RAIN HAS MOVED OUT OF THE CWA WITH ONLY ISOLATED 
SHOWERS REMAINING. 06Z GFS SHOWS MAIN MOISTURE AXIS SHIFTING 
TO THE EAST THIS MORNING SO UPDATED TO TAKE OUT LIKELY POPS.
WENT WITH 40 PERCENT POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA FOR TODAY
AS ACTIVITY LIKELY WILL INCREASE WITH HEATING AND ANOTHER
SHORT WAVE ROTATING THROUGH.  

.PREV DISCUSSION...
.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
COLD FRONT MOVING SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING SHOULD BE TO
THE SOUTH BY LATER TODAY WITH NORTH TO NRTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW 
AROUND HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH. A COUPLE OF WEAK SHORT WAVES
SWING AROUND UPPER TROF TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA TODAY AND THIS
WILL KEEP A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN GOING TODAY ESPECIALLY IN THE
NORTH. KEPT LIKELY POPS IN THE NORTH AND WEST FOR TODAY WITH 
HIGH CHANCE ELSEWHERE. CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS AND COOLER DRIER AIR
WILL KEEP MAXES WELL DOWN INTO THE 70S IN THE NORTH WITH OTHER
AREAS ONLY IN THE 80S. THE RESULTING LESS UNSTABLE AIR SHOULD
HOLD DOWN THE STRENGTH OF ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP AND
LITTLE IF ANY SEVERE WEATHER IS EXPECTED. UPPER TROF IS SLOW TO
MOVE PAST THE AREA SO KEPT POPS GOING THROUGH TONIGHT. WENT WITH
DRY FORECAST FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE TROF AXIS MOVES
PAST AND MOISTURE DECREASES. TEMPS SHOULD STAY BELOW NORMAL WITH
MINS IN THE 50S IN THE NORTH AND IN THE 60S IN OTHER AREAS AND 
MAXES MOSTLY IN THE 80S.     
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
REALLY SEE NO NEED TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED. 
MODELS STILL IN GOOD AGREEMENT...BRINGING SYSTEM OUT OF TEXAS ON 
WEDNESDAY...ALBEIT A LITTLE LATER THAN SHOWN YESTERDAY. OF 
COURSE...THAT FAR OUT IN TIME...MODEL DEVIATIONS ARE TO BE EXPECTED. 
FOCUS OF PRECIPITATION WILL STILL BE WESTERN ARKANSAS GOING INTO 
THURSDAY...AS H5 RIDGE TAKES SHAPE OVER THE APPALACHIANS...AND 
TROUGH DIGS INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 

BY FRIDAY...FOCUS SHIFTS MORE TOWARD SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...AS A 
SHORTWAVE MOVES DOWN TOWARD THE GULF COAST. BOTTOM LINE IS THAT 
THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIODS. BEING LATE JULY...THE BEST CHANCES 
WILL BE DURING AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING PRIME CONVECTIVE TIME. 

OF NOTE...HOWEVER...WILL BE THE WARMUP IN TEMPERATURES. BY MID TO 
LATE WEEK...SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL RETURN...BRINGING GULF MOISTURE...

FRONT NEARLY STATIONARY IN NORTHERN ARKANSAS. WARM AND UNSTABLE AIR 
OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTH...AS THE TEMPERATURE AT OFFICE WAS 98 DEGREES 
EARLIER. DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE 70S ACROSS THE STATE...ADDING TO THE 
INSTABILITY. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPED DURING 
THE AFTERNOON IN WESTERN AND CENTRAL ARKANSAS.

A WEAK LOW WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT IN EASTERN OKLAHOMA TONIGHT 
AS THE UPPER TROUGH MOVES NORTHEAST. THIS WILL MOVE THE FRONT 
SOUTHEAST...WITH THE AXIS OF HEAVIEST RAINFALL IN WESTERN AND 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS. SOME LOCATIONS COULD SEE OVER AN INCH OF 
RAIN...AS WINDS ALOFT ARE WEAK AND STORMS WILL MOVE SLOWLY. MAIN 
CONCERN WITH SEVERE WEATHER IS THE FLOOD POTENTIAL...BUT DUE TO 
AFOREMENTIONED INSTABILITY...COULD SEE SOME STORMS WITH WIND DAMAGE 
AND LARGE HAIL.

RAINFALL AXIS WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST SUNDAY...AS UPPER SYSTEM MOVES 
EAST. HEAVY RAINFALL POTENTIAL STILL POSSIBLE ON SUNDAY IN NORTHERN

AFTERNOON IN THE NORTH...AS DRIER AIR WILL FILTER IN. MUCH COOLER 
TEMPS ON SUNDAY...WITH GUIDANCE GIVING HARRISON ONLY 67 FOR A HIGH. 
DID NOT LOWER TEMPS QUITE THAT MUCH...BUT WENT COOLER THAN THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST. MID SHIFT MIGHT HAVE TO LOWER THEM EVEN MORE.

327 AM CDT SAT JUL 24 2004

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE MOVING ACROSS NORTHWEST ARKANSAS 
THIS MORNING. MOVEMENT IS RATHER SLOW TO THE NORTHEAST AND SOME 
AREAS WILL LIKELY MEASURE OVER AN INCH THIS MORNING. SATELLITE 
IMAGES SHOW ANOTHER STORM COMPLEX IN NORTH CENTRAL OKLAHOMA BUT THE 
CURRENT TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM WILL ALLOW IT TO MISS ARKANSAS. 

HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE MID SOUTH AND A DEEP TROUGH IS IN 
PLACE OVER THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES. SHORT WAVES WILL CONTINUE TO 
ROTATE AROUND THE BASE OF THE TROUGH THROUGH THE WEEKEND. NORTHWEST 
FLOW WILL RETURN TO THE AREA ON TUESDAY. 

THE COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO STRETCH FROM WEST CENTRAL ARKANSAS 
ACROSS NORTH ARKANSAS. SLOW SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT IS 
EXPECTED TODAY. THE ONGOING PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE INTO MISSOURI 
THIS MORNING. MORE THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP BY MID DAY HOWEVER 
WITH DAYTIME HEATING. WILL GO WITH 80 PERCENT POPS IN THE NORTH THIS 
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. THE SOUTHEAST WILL HAVE THE LOWEST CHANCE 
POPS...CLOSEST TO THE RIDGE AXIS. THE MAIN THREAT WITH THE STORMS 
TODAY WILL BE HEAVY RAIN. MOVEMENT OF THE STORMS WILL BE SLOW AND 
SEVERAL INCHES OF RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE IF A STORM REMAINS IN ONE 
LOCATION FOR ANY LENGTH OF TIME. BEST CHANCES OF RAIN TODAY WILL BE 
IN THE NORTH. TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND 
PRECIPITATION. 

MODELS ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT BUT SEEM TO KEEP THE SYSTEMS TOO FAR 
TO THE NORTH. CROSS SECTIONS SHOW DECENT MOISTURE ACROSS THE AREA 
TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY. NORTH ARKANSAS IS POISED TO RECEIVE SOME 
HEALTHY RAINS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE 
PUSHED TO THE SOUTH TONIGHT BY THE COLD FRONT AND AN MCS WILL 
DEVELOP IN THE PLAINS AND MOVE ACROSS THE AREA. THE COLD FRONT WILL 
CONTINUE MOVING SOUTH THROUGH SUNDAY AND WILL TRANSLATE THE 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES SOUTHWARD. PRECIPITATION WILL END ACROSS THE 
AREA BY MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE AREA 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. COOLER TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED RIGHT 
INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK.
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
EXTENDED RANGE SOLUTIONS ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT THIS MORNING. 
INDICATIONS ARE THAT AFTER A BRIEF BREAK...PATTERN WILL ONCE AGAIN 
BECOME MORE ACTIVE BY MID WEEK. ON TUESDAY...RIDGING WILL BE 
PREDOMINANT OVER THE MID SOUTH...AS REMNANTS OF WEEKEND SYSTEM WILL 
BE HUNG UP INVOF THE GULF COAST. OTHER THAN A FEW CLOUDS OVER 
CENTRAL AND SOUTH ARKANSAS...CONDITIONS WILL BE DRY/MOSTLY SUNNY FOR 
MUCH OF TUESDAY. 

BY LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...MOISTURE WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST...
AND A SHORTWAVE WILL KICK OUT OF SOUTH TEXAS. THIS WILL BRING ABOUT 
THE NEXT CHANCE OF RAINFALL. RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST...WITH THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY BEING WESTERN ARKANSAS THROUGH THURSDAY. AS 
LARGE H5 TROUGH BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE CONUS...
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL SET UP OVER WESTERN ARKANSAS. MCS POTENTIAL 
IS CERTAINLY A POSSIBILITY ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND AGAIN ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT. 

BY FRIDAY...FOCUS LOOKS TO SHIFT MORE TOWARD THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF 
THE FORECAST AREA...AS SURFACE TROUGH INTERACTS WITH DEVELOPING 
UPPER LOW OVER THE RED RIVER VALLEY. 

WITH THE EXCEPTION OF INTRODUCING POPS...MADE VERY LITTLE CHANGES TO 
THE GOING EXTENDED FORECAST.

IN NORTHERN ARKANSAS...ALTHOUGH IS IT MAINLY A WIND SHIFT LINE AS 
THE DRIER AIR IS STILL IN NORTHERN MISSOURI.

BROAD UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION WILL MOVE OFF

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
UPPER RIDGE HOLDING OVER THE AREA TODAY KEEPING THE AREA DRY. SOME 
ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA ASSOCIATED
WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE AND WILL WATCH RADAR TRENDS...MAY NEED TO 
MENTION THAT FOR SOUTHERN ZONES FOR THIS EVENING. OTHERWISE SHOULD
BE DRY. HAZY CONDITIONS LIKELY TO PERSIST TONIGHT WHICH MAY TURN INTO
PATCHY FOG FOR A FEW HOURS AROUND SUNRISE. HAZE MAY CONTINUE INTO
FRIDAY AS THE UPPER RIDGE HANGS AROUND. COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH
FROM THE NORTH BUT WILL LIKELY HAVE HARD TIME PENETRATING INTO THE
STATE...ESPECIALLY AT FIRST. SHORT WAVE TO THE SOUTH LOOKS LIKE IT
WILL MOVE TO THE WEST FRIDAY WITH RIDGING BUILDING BACK INTO 
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS SO DROPPED POPS FOR THE SOUTH FOR FRIDAY. INTRODUCED
POPS FOR THE NORTH FRIDAY WITH THE FRONT BUT WILL NOT GO TOO HIGH
WITH POPS YET. INCREASED POPS ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE 
FRONT SHOULD SLOWLY KNEAD ITS WAY SOUTH THROUGH THE OZARKS. THE FRONT
PROBABLY WILL FINALLY MAKE IT INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS SATURDAY WITH
GOOD MOISTURE BEHIND IT AND A SHORT WAVE OR TWO ROTATING AROUND 
THE UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER TROF TO THE NORTH. THIS WILL LEAD TO
GOOD CHANCES OF RAIN SATURDAY THROUGH MOST OF SUNDAY WITH THE BEST
CHANCE OF RAIN AND THE HEAVIEST RAIN IN THE NORTH. AM HESITANT TO
GO WITH LIKELY POPS THIS FAR AHEAD SINCE MESOSCALE INFLUENCES 
BETWEEN NOW AND THEN COULD SHIFT THE MAIN RAIN AXIS AROUND ONE WAY 
OR ANOTHER. WENT WITH 50 POPS IN THE NORTH DECREASING TO 30 IN THE
SOUTH. WENT CLOSE TO PERSISTENCE ON TEMPS THROUGH FRIDAY THEN WENT A 
LITTLE COOLER ON MINS IN THE NORTH FRIDAY NIGHT. MAXES OVER THE WEEKEND
MAY BE HELD DOWN A LOT BY CLOUDS AND WENT CLOSE TO MOS. MINS LIKELY
WILL NOT GET DOWN TO MOS VALUES DUE TO CLOUDS BUT LOWER 60S IN THE
NORTH DOES NOT LOOK OUT OF LINE.  
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES STATES WILL MOVE EAST 
MONDAY...DRAGGING THE COLD FRONT WITH IT. AT THIS TIME...WILL GO 
WITH A DRY FORECAST...ALTHOUGH PORTIONS OF THE SOUTH AND EAST MAY 
STILL SEE EFFECTS OF THE FRONT DEPENDING ON THE SPEED. A DRY 
FORECAST WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EXTENDED...AS MOISTURE LEVELS 
WILL REMAIN LOW AND NO TRIGGER IS SEEN TO SPARK OFF ANY CONVECTION.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT
UPPER RIDGE HOLDING OVER THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL GENERALLY
CONTINUE UNTIL FRIDAY WITH SOME MINOR CHANGES. COLD FRONT WILL
APPROACH FROM THE NORTH BUT WILL LIKELY HANG JUST NORTH OF THE 
AREA INTO FRIDAY. SHOULD SEE LITTLE CHANGE TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
NIGHT WITH NOT MANY CLOUDS AND PRACTICALLY NO CONVECTION AS CAPPING
SHOULD DOMINATE. TEMPS SHOULD BE CLOSE TO PERSISTENCE ALTHOUGH MAXES
MAY MOVE UP A LITTLE FROM EFFECTS OF THE APPROACHING FRONT. STILL
NOT A LOT OF CONFIDENCE IN TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE ACROSS THE 
AREA AS THE UPPER RIDGE REMAINS IN THE AREA. THERE STILL LOOKS TO BE 
A SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE RIDING ALONG THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE RIDGE 
WHICH COULD HELP SEND THE FRONT INTO THE STATE LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY
NIGHT AND A SECOND SHORT WAVE SATURDAY MAY GIVE IT ANOTHER SHOVE.
WILL GO WITH THE FRONT BEING NEAR THE NORTHERN BORDER ON FRIDAY
AND SLOWLY MOVING TO THE SOUTH ACROSS THE STATE SATURDAY. MUCH OF
THE CONVECTION SHOULD BE ALONG OR BEHIND THE FRONT SO WILL NOT BEGIN
POPS IN THE NORTH UNTIL FRIDAY AND WILL INCREASE TO CHANCE POPS LATE
IN THE DAY. MEANWHILE...A SHORT WAVE FROM THE SOUTH SHEARS INTO
THE AREA FRIDAY AND WILL PUT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE SOUTH ON FRIDAY
DUE TO THIS. WILL KEEP POPS OUT OF CENTRAL SECTIONS FOR FRIDAY FOR 
NOW. WILL INCREASE POPS TO CHANCE CATEGORY ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY
NIGHT INTO SATURDAY AS THE FRONT MAY SHIFT TO THE SOUTH AND THE 
REMNANTS OF THE SOUTHERN SHORT WAVE REMAIN IN THE AREA. GFS HINTING
AT AREA OF OVERRUNNING SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL GO LOWER ON 
MAXES SATURDAY DUE TO EFFECTS OF THE FRONT AND THE ASSOCIATED CLOUDS

DUE TO STRONG HIGH PRESSURE...THINK THAT THE FRONT WILL HAVE A HARD

AS WAS THE CASE YESTERDAY AT THIS TIME...MODELS CONTINUE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT AND WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF GFS/ETA FOR NEAR TERM TEMPS 
AND POPS BUT A GFS/UKMET FOR MASS FIELDS IS PREFERRED. THE TIMING OF 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT REMAINS A CHALLENGE BUT FOR NOW WILL NOT 
STRAY TOO FAR FROM WHAT IS ALREADY OUT TO THE GENERAL PUBLIC. ONE 
COLD FRONT IN JULY WAS HARD ENOUGH TO GET BUT THE ODDS OF GETTING 
TWO COLD FRONTS IN JULY MOVE ALL THE WAY ACROSS ARKANSAS ARE SLIM.  
THE NEW AND IMPROVED GFSLR 21.00 IS QUITE DIFFERENT FROM THE PREVIOUS
VERSION WHICH HAD A CLOSED OFF 570 DAM 500MB LOW OVER MISSOURI JULY 
28. NOW IT SHOWS A MORE CREDIBLE 579 TROF. GO FIGURE. TOO BAD I HAD 
TO WAIT 24 HOURS TO SEE THE CORRECTED VERSION.

300 PM CDT TUE JUL 20 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
UPPER RIDGE SHOULD INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
WHICH SHOULD END THE DANGEROUS NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN FOR AWHILE
AND PLACE A GOOD CAP OR TWO ON THE ATMOSPHERE. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO
HOT AND DRY CONDITIONS OVER THE NEXT TWO DAYS AND THERE WILL BE NO
MENTION OF RAIN. TEMPS LIKELY WILL SLOWLY INCREASE. COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH THURSDAY BUT SHOULD NOT REACH THE AREA DUE 
TO THE UPPER RIDGE IN PLACE. THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT MAY ALLOW TEMPS
TO RISE A LITTLE HOWEVER. THE RIDGE FINALLY WEAKENS FRIDAY INTO 
SATURDAY AND A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVES MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN EDGES
OF IT. THIS MAY ALLOW THE FRONT TO MOVE INTO THE AREA FRIDAY AND
THROUGH MUCH OF THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. CONFIDENCE IN THIS IS STILL
A LITTLE LACKING AS 500 MB HEIGHTS REMAIN AT OR ABOVE 5880 METERS
WHICH COULD ENABLE THE RIDGE TO HOLD FIRM ENOUGH TO KEEP THE FRONT
TO THE NORTH. WILL CONTINUE WITH ENHANCED POPS IN THE NORTH FOR
FRIDAY WITH POPS DEVELOPING EVERYWHERE AND KEEP 40 PERCENT POPS
IN THE NORTH EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT SPREADING TO ALL AREAS BY LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL BACK OFF ON TEMP FORECASTS FOR FRIDAY AND 
FRIDAY NIGHT AS WELL.     
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
FRONT WILL SLOWLY MAKE PROGRESS THROUGH THE STATE SATURDAY. DUE TO 
UNCERTAINITY OF PLACEMENT DUE TO THE STRENGTH OF BERMUDA HIGH...HAVE 
LEFT CHANCE POPS IN FOR SATURDAY. AS FRONT MOVES TO THE SOUTH 
SUNDAY...HAVE TAPERED POPS BACK FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. DRY WEATHER 
WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED. AM NOT BUYING INTO

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
THE LATEST SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATES CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY 
CONDITIONS ACROSS ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA. 19Z SURFACE STREAMLINE 
ANALYSIS INDICATES A LIGHT SOUTHWEST FLOW ACROSS NORTHERN AND 
CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

FORECAST ISENTROPIC FIELDS PROMOTE THE POTENTIAL FOR ELEVATED 
CONVECTION ACROSS PORTIONS OF MISSOURI LATE TONIGHT. FORECAST STORM 
MOTION VECTORS INDICATE THAT THIS ACTIVITY COULD AFFECT EXTREME 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY 
TOMORROW MORNING AS IT WEAKENS. HAVE ADJUSTED POP AND WX FORECASTS 
ACCORDINGLY.  

OTHERWISE...THE REST OF THE SHORT TERM PERIODS APPEAR DRY...AS THE 
AMPLITUDE OF THE OVERALL UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL DECREASE ACROSS 
THE U.S. STRONG CONVECTIVE INHIBITION WILL OVERWHELM AND 
WEAK...SMALL SCALE FORCING MECHANISMS TO PROHIBIT CONVECTION.

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY
DEAMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL ALLOW SHORT WAVES TO PASS 
ACROSS MAINLY THE NORTHERN SECTIONS LATE THIS WEEK. A COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE FRIDAY MORNING. WILL KEEP 
POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING AS THE 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH. MOISTURE LOOKS BETTER ON THE LATEST RUN OF THE 
GFS.  WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTH THROUGH 
SUNDAY MORNING AS THE COLD FRONT WILL EXIT THE SOUTH AT THIS TIME. 
WILL KEEP THE REST OF THE AREA DRY FOR SUNDAY AND ALL AREAS DRY ON 
MONDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.

NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY 
TOMORROW MORNING AS IT WEAKENS. HAVE ADJUSTED POP AND WX FORECASTS 
ACCORDINGLY.  

OTHERWISE...THE REST OF THE SHORT TERM PERIODS APPEAR DRY...AS THE 
AMPLITUDE OF THE OVERALL UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL DECREASE ACROSS 
THE U.S. STRONG CONVECTIVE INHIBITION WILL OVERWHELM AND 
WEAK...SMALL SCALE FORCING MECHANISMS TO PROHIBIT CONVECTION.

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY
DEAMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL PATTERN WILL ALLOW SHORT WAVES TO PASS 
ACROSS MAINLY THE NORTHERN SECTIONS LATE THIS WEEK. A COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTH PART OF THE STATE FRIDAY MORNING. WILL KEEP 
POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING AS THE 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH. MOISTURE LOOKS BETTER ON THE LATEST RUN OF THE 
GFS.  WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTH THROUGH 
SUNDAY MORNING AS THE COLD FRONT WILL EXIT THE SOUTH AT THIS TIME. 
WILL KEEP THE REST OF THE AREA DRY FOR SUNDAY AND ALL AREAS DRY ON 
MONDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO NORMAL THROUGH THIS PERIOD.

DRIER AIR HAS CONTD TO WORK INTO MUCH OF THE FA OVER THE LAST 24

NOT TOO MANY CHGS NOTED IN THE FCST FOR THE SHORT TERM. EXPECT NWLY 
FLOW ALOFT TO PERSIST ACRS AR THRU TUE WITH UPPER RIDGE OVER THE WRN 
STATES AND TROF IN THE EAST. WILL SEE SEVERAL WEAK UPPER LVL 
SHORTWVS DROPPING SEWD INTO THE AREA. HOWEVER...DUE TO LACK OF SIG 
MOISTURE...ONLY EXPECT SOME CLOUDS FROM TIME TO TIME.

MODELS CONT TO INDC THAT THE UPPER FLOW WILL DE-AMPLIFY BY MIDWEEK 
WITH UPPER RIDGE FLATTENING AND NOSING INTO AR FROM THE W. THIS WILL 
ALLOW TEMPS TO RETURN TO MORE NORMAL LVLS FOR LATE JULY ALONG WITH 
RISING HUMIDITY VALUES. HAVE GONE MORE WITH THE ETA TEMPS THE NEXT 
SEVERAL PDS.

NOT EXPECTING ANY PRECIP INTO MIDWEEK. RETURN FLOW/WAA PATTERN COULD
SET OFF SOME CONVECTION TO OUR NW LATE TNGT AND INTO TUE MRNG. 
EXPECT ANYTHING THAT DOES FORM TO STAY TO THE N OF THE FA AS SFC 
RIDGE STILL FCST TO LINGER OVER AR.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...
THE LATEST MESOSCALE SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES A STATIONARY 
BOUNDARY...FROM NEAR MONTICELLO...TO CLARKSVILLE. LOCAL RADARS 
INDICATES WIDELY SCATTERED RETURNS ALONG THIS BOUNDARY. MOST 
UNSTABLE CONDITIONS APPEAR TO BE ALONG THE BOUNDARY...ACROSS EXTREME 
SOUTHEAST PORTIONS OF THE CWA. IF THE CAP CAN BE BROKEN...CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE EXPLOSIVE...AND DAMAGING WIND GUSTS WOULD BE 
LIKELY. 

OVERNIGHT...ORGANIZED CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT APPEARS TO BE A GOOD 
POSSIBILITY ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS. FORECAST MOTION 
VECTORS FOR ANY COMPLEX THAT FORMS INDICATE THAT NORTHERN PORTIONS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA WOULD BE MOST LIKELY AFFECTED BY ANY ORGANIZED 
STORM COMPLEX THAT FORMS.

RESIDUAL BOUNDARIES WILL BE A FOCUS FOR CONVECTION ON FRIDAY. IN

327 PM CDT THU JUL 15 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...
THE LATEST MESOSCALE SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES A STATIONARY 
BOUNDARY...FROM NEAR MONTICELLO...TO CLARKSVILLE. LOCAL RADARS 
INDICATES WIDELY SCATTERED RETURNS ALONG THIS BOUNDARY. MOST 
UNSTABLE CONDITIONS APPEAR TO BE ALONG THE BOUNDARY...ACROSS EXTREME 
SOUTHEAST PORTIONS OF THE CWA. IF THE CAP CAN BE BROKEN...CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT WOULD BE EXPLOSIVE...AND DAMAGING WIND GUSTS WOULD BE 
LIKELY. 

OVERNIGHT...ORGANIZED CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT APPEARS TO BE A GOOD 
POSSIBILITY ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS. FORECAST MOTION 
VECTORS FOR ANY COMPLEX THAT FORMS INDICATE THAT NORTHERN PORTIONS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA WOULD BE MOST LIKELY AFFECTED BY ANY ORGANIZED 
STORM COMPLEX THAT FORMS.

RESIDUAL BOUNDARIES WILL BE A FOCUS FOR CONVECTION ON FRIDAY. IN 
ADDITION...A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH LATE ON FRIDAY. EXPECT 
SCATTERED CONVECTION FRIDAY TO EARLY SATURDAY. DRIER AND COOLER 
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL SUNDAY AND MONDAY.

WEAK COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING. 
APPEARS STRONG CAP IS HOLDING ACROSS THE AREA AS THUNDERSTORMS STAYED
TO THE EAST OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT. MODELS AND GUIDANCE KEEP THE AREA
DRY TODAY SUGGESTING THE ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN CAPPED. HOWEVER WITH
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IN THE AREA AND POSSIBLY AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY 
FROM THE MCS IN NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI...AM RELUCTANT TO NOT HAVE A
MENTION OF RAIN IN THE FORECAST. WILL GO WITH 20 PERCEBT POPS ACROSS
THE AREA MOSTLY FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND GO WITH ISOLATED WORDING. IF
FORCING ALONG THE BOUNDARIES CAN OVERCOME THE CAP THEN SIGNIFICANT
DEVELOPMENT WOULD TAKE PLACE. THINGS MAY STAY CAPPED EARLY TONIGHT 
BUT A SHORT WAVE IN NORTHWEST FLOW MAY SET OFF THUNDERSTORMS IN 
THE PLAINS LATE TODAY OR EARLY TONIGHT WHICH MAY DEVELOP INTO AN
MCS WHICH COULD ROLL INTO THE AREA LATER TONIGHT INTO EARLY FRIDAY.
THE SPC DAY ONE OUTLOOK SEEMS TO REFLECT THIS AND WILL GO WITH 
CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH FOR LATER TONIGHT FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. 
FOR FRIDAY...THERE MAY BE SOME ONGOING SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS
IN THE MORNING FROM MCS ACTIVITY TONIGHT WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE
OUT OF THE AREA DURING THE DAY. A STRONGER SHORT WAVE APPROACHES 
THE AREA WHICH COULD SET OFF ANOTHER MCS IN THE PLAINS WHICH MAY 
REACH THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. A COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE
CWA FRIDAY NIGHT AND MOVE TO THE SOUTH SATURDAY. DUE TO ALL 
THIS...WENT WITH 30 PERCENT POPS ACROSS THE AREA FOR MOST OF FRIDAY 
AND 40 PERCENT POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. DECREASED POPS FROM THE NORTH
ON SATURDAY AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES TO THE SOUTH. LOOKS RATHER DRY 
AFTER THAT BUT WITH NORTHWEST FLOW IN PLACE...CANNOT TRUST THAT 
COMPLETELY. DID TAKE ALL RAIN OUT FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND KEPT 
SMALL POPS IN FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON. KEPT DRY FORECAST IN AFTER
THAT...BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT REAL HIGH. EFFECTS OF THE FRONT 
TODAY SHOULD LOWER TEMPS A LITTLE AND TAKE THE EDGE OFF THE HEAT. 
FORECAST TEMPS AND DEW POINTS YIELD HEAT INDICES OF 100 TO 105 
THIS AFTERNOON IN MOST OF CENTRAL AND SOUTH. BASED ON THIS WILL
NOT NEED TO EXTEND THE HEAT ADVISORY BUT MAY STILL MENTION THE
HIGH HEAT INDICES IN THE HWO AND WEATHER SUMMARY. APPEARS THE
FRONT FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO MODERATE
TEMPS A LITTLE MORE...BUT THEY SHOULD STILL RUN CLOSE TO 
NORMAL.

TO OUR NORTH. 32

.DISCUSSION...
UPPER RIDGE HAS STRENGTHEND BUT IS RETROGRADING TO THE WEST AS A 
TROF DIGS INTO THE EASTERN U.S. THIS WILL DEVELOP NORTHWEST FLOW
ALOFT OVER THE AREA AND ALLOW A COLD FRONT TO REACH THE AREA LATE 
TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE FRONT WILL WEAKEN AND STALL IN THE AREA 
THEN THE REMAINING BOUNDARY WILL LIKELY OSCILLATE AROUND THE AREA
FOR A FEW DAYS. ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT MAY JOIN FORCES WITH THE
FIRST BOUNDARY OVER THE WEEKEND. THE AREA WILL BE VULNERABLE TO 
MCS ACTION FROM THE PLAINS ESPECIALLY FROM THURSDAY THROUGH 
SUNDAY. OF COURSE TIMING AND IDENTIFICATION OF THESE IS NOT
GOOD AT THIS POINT. THE WARM HUMID AND CAPPED ATMOSPHERE WILL
CARRY THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY AND WILL NOT MENTION ANY POPS
DURING THE DAYTIME PERIOD. BY EARLY TONIGHT...THE FRONT MAY REACH 
NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS AND THIS SHOULD WEAKEN OR BREAK THE CAP
IN THAT AREA. CONVERGENGE AROUND THE FRONT WILL BE WEAK AS WIND 
SPEEDS ARE NOT STRONG AND DIRECTIONAL CHANGE IN THE WIND IS NOT
MUCH EITHER. WILL GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTHEAST FOR
TONIGHT. IF ANYTHING DOES GET STARTED IN THAT AREA OR MOVES IN FROM
THE NORTH...IT WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE STRONG TO SEVERE DUE
TO THE STRONG INSTABILITY THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE. CONTINUED SMALL 
POPS IN THE NORTHEAST INTO THURSDAY THEN SPREAD THEM ACROSS THE 
REST OF THE AREA BY AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE ACROSS
MOST OF THE AREA OR IF NOT...OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MAY BE PRESENT 
FROM CONVECTION TONIGHT. AFTER THAT...THE CHANCE IS THERE THAT AN
MCS COULD MOVE ACROSS PART OF THE AREA SO WILL KEEP 20 PERCENT 
POPS GOING INTO THE WEEKEND. ENHANCED THE POPS SATURDAY AFTERNOON
AND SUNDAY MORNING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEXT FRONT. NEW GFS BRINGS DRY 
AIR INTO THE AREA MONDAY AND TUESDAY. LEFT FORECAST DRY FOR MONDAY
NIGHT AND TUESDAY FOR NOW. MAXES TODAY SHOULD BE WELL INTO THE 90S
AGAIN WITH HEAT INDICES IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH OVER 105. THINGS
SHOULD BACK OFF THURSDAY DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF THE FRONT OR ANY

UPPER RIDGE HAS STRENGTHEND BUT IS RETROGRADING TO THE WEST AS A 
TROF DIGS INTO THE EASTERN U.S. THIS WILL DEVELOP NORTHWEST FLOW
ALOFT OVER THE AREA AND ALLOW A COLD FRONT TO REACH THE AREA LATE 
TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE FRONT WILL WEAKEN AND STALL IN THE AREA 
THEN THE REMAINING BOUNDARY WILL LIKELY OSCILLATE AROUND THE AREA
FOR A FEW DAYS. ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT MAY JOIN FORCES WITH THE
FIRST BOUNDARY OVER THE WEEKEND. THE AREA WILL BE VULNERABLE TO 
MCS ACTION FROM THE PLAINS ESPECIALLY FROM THURSDAY THROUGH 
SUNDAY. OF COURSE TIMING AND IDENTIFICATION OF THESE IS NOT
GOOD AT THIS POINT. THE WARM HUMID AND CAPPED ATMOSPHERE WILL
CARRY THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY AND WILL NOT MENTION ANY POPS
DURING THE DAYTIME PERIOD. BY EARLY TONIGHT...THE FRONT MAY REACH 
NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS AND THIS SHOULD WEAKEN OR BREAK THE CAP
IN THAT AREA. CONVERGENGE AROUND THE FRONT WILL BE WEAK AS WIND 
SPEEDS ARE NOT STRONG AND DIRECTIONAL CHANGE IN THE WIND IS NOT
MUCH EITHER. WILL GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTHEAST FOR
TONIGHT. IF ANYTHING DOES GET STARTED IN THAT AREA OR MOVES IN FROM
THE NORTH...IT WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BE STRONG TO SEVERE DUE
TO THE STRONG INSTABILITY THAT WILL BE AVAILABLE. CONTINUED SMALL 
POPS IN THE NORTHEAST INTO THURSDAY THEN SPREAD THEM ACROSS THE 
REST OF THE AREA BY AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE ACROSS
MOST OF THE AREA OR IF NOT...OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES MAY BE PRESENT 
FROM CONVECTION TONIGHT. AFTER THAT...THE CHANCE IS THERE THAT AN
MCS COULD MOVE ACROSS PART OF THE AREA SO WILL KEEP 20 PERCENT 
POPS GOING INTO THE WEEKEND. ENHANCED THE POPS SATURDAY AFTERNOON
AND SUNDAY MORNING TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEXT FRONT. NEW GFS BRINGS DRY

MADE SMALL ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GRIDS IN THE FIRST PERIOD ON ACCOUNT 
OF FEWER CLOUDS AROUND THAN WE HAD FORECAST. UPDATE OUT ALREADY. 32

.DISCUSSION...
UPPER RIDGE CENTERED TO THE WEST OF THE AREA WILL COVER THE AREA 
ENOUGH TODAY TO KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE CAPPED AND BRING STRONG HEATING 
COMBINED WITH THE HIGH HUMIDITY THAT HAS BEEN IN PACE FROM THE 
RECENT RAINY WEATHER. 850 TEMPS PROGGED TO REACH 20 TO 22C WHICH 
TRANLATES TO SURFACE TEMPS IN THE UPPER 90S BUT THESE WILL BE 
TEMPERED A LITTLE FROM THE STILL MOIST SOIL. IT WILL STILL LIKELY BE 
THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE SUMMER SO FAR FOR MOST AREAS. AFTERNOON HEAT 
INDICES IN MOST OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS WILL REACH OR 
EXCEED 105. THE SAME IS LIKELY ON WEDNESDAY ALTHOUGH THE PATTERN 
WILL BEGIN TO CHANGE. NIGHTTIME TEMPS WILL STAY AT OR ABOVE 80 MUCH 
OF THE NIGHT IN MOST OF THOSE AREAS SO WILL CONTINUE WITH THE HEAT 
ADVISORY FOR TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY FOR ALL BUT NORTHERN AREAS. 
UPPER TROF DIGS INTO THE NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY WHICH SLIPS THE UPPER 
RIDGE TO THE WEST AND PUTS THIS AREA INTO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. THIS 
WILL ENABLE A WEAK COLD FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY INTO 
THURSDAY. THE RIDGE ALOFT WILL HAVE ENOUGH OF AN EFFECT TO KEEP 
SIGNIFICANT COOLING FROM OCCURRING BUT THE FRONT WILL LIKELY TAKE A 
FEW DEGREES OFF DEW POINTS AND EASE THE HEAT ADVISORY CONDITIONS. 
THE RIDGE MAY ALSO KEEP ENOUGH OF A CAP GOING TO KEEP MUCH 
CONVECTION FROM DEVELOPING. CONVERGENCE AROUND THE FRONT WILL BE 
WEAK AS THE DIRECTIONAL WIND SHIFT WILL BE SMALL AND SPEEDS WILL BE 
LIGHT. THIS WILL LIMIT CHANCES OF RAIN. THE CAP SHOULD BE STRONG 
ENOUGH TO KEEP MENTION OF RAIN OUT OF THE FORECAST TODAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY MORNING THEN WILL ONLY HAVE 20 PERCENT POPS WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT FOR THE FRONT. THE FRONT BECOMES VERY WEAK AND 
HANGS AROUND THE AREA. SEVERAL SHORT WAVES MOVE THROUGH IN NORTHWEST 
FLOW AND THERE WILL BE THE RISK OF AN MCS OR TWO OR MORE AFFECTING 
THE AREA LATER IN THE WEEK. GENERALLY KEPT TEMPS CLOSE TO NORMAL AND 
LEFT IN BROAD BRUSH 20 PERCENT POPS THROUGH THE EXTENDED AS IT IS NOT

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
400 AM CDT TUE JUL 13 2004

.DISCUSSION...
UPPER RIDGE CENTERED TO THE WEST OF THE AREA WILL COVER THE AREA ENOUGH
TODAY TO KEEP THE ATMOSPHERE CAPPED AND BRING STRONG HEATING COMBINED
WITH THE HIGH HUMIDITY THAT HAS BEEN IN PACE FROM THE RECENT RAINY
WEATHER. 850 TEMPS PROGGED TO REACH 20 TO 22C WHICH TRANLATES TO
SURFACE TEMPS IN THE UPPER 90S BUT THESE WILL BE TEMPERED A LITTLE
FROM THE STILL MOIST SOIL. IT WILL STILL LIKELY BE THE HOTTEST DAY
OF THE SUMMER SO FAR FOR MOST AREAS. AFTERNOON HEAT INDICES IN MOST
OF CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS WILL REACH OR EXCEED 105. THE SAME
IS LIKELY ON WEDNESDAY ALTHOUGH THE PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO CHANGE. 
NIGHTTIME TEMPS WILL STAY AT OR ABOVE 80 MUCH OF THE NIGHT IN MOST
OF THOSE AREAS SO WILL CONTINUE WITH THE HEAT ADVISORY FOR TODAY
THROUGH WEDNESDAY FOR ALL BUT NORTHERN AREAS. UPPER TROF DIGS INTO
THE NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY WHICH SLIPS THE UPPER RIDGE TO THE WEST 
AND PUTS THIS AREA INTO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. THIS WILL ENABLE A 
WEAK COLD FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. 
THE RIDGE ALOFT WILL HAVE ENOUGH OF AN EFFECT TO KEEP SIGNIFICANT
COOLING FROM OCCURRING BUT THE FRONT WILL LIKELY TAKE A FEW DEGREES
OFF DEW POINTS AND EASE THE HEAT ADVISORY CONDITIONS. THE RIDGE MAY
ALSO KEEP ENOUGH OF A CAP GOING TO KEEP MUCH CONVECTION FROM 
DEVELOPING. CONVERGENCE AROUND THE FRONT WILL BE WEAK AS THE 
DIRECTIONAL WIND SHIFT WILL BE SMALL AND SPEEDS WILL BE LIGHT. 
THIS WILL LIMIT CHANCES OF RAIN. THE CAP SHOULD BE STRONG ENOUGH
TO KEEP MENTION OF RAIN OUT OF THE FORECAST TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
MORNING THEN WILL ONLY HAVE 20 PERCENT POPS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND
NIGHT FOR THE FRONT. THE FRONT BECOMES VERY WEAK AND HANGS AROUND
THE AREA. SEVERAL SHORT WAVES MOVE THROUGH IN NORTHWEST FLOW AND 
THERE WILL BE THE RISK OF AN MCS OR TWO OR MORE AFFECTING THE AREA
LATER IN THE WEEK. GENERALLY KEPT TEMPS CLOSE TO NORMAL AND LEFT
IN BROAD BRUSH 20 PERCENT POPS THROUGH THE EXTENDED AS IT IS NOT
POSSIBLE TO TIME EFFECTS OF ANY MCS THAT AFFECTS THE AREA.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...
MODELS ONCE AGAIN IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT AND ONCE AGAIN ARE SHOWING 
VERY GOOD RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY. AS PER THE PAST FEW DAYS...WILL 
SIMPLY GO WITH A BLEND OF FORECAST SOLUTIONS.

CONVECTION ALREADY FIRING UP ON WHATS LEFT OF SHEER AXIS THAT IS 
STRETCHED OUT FROM THE RED RIVER ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS TO THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. AS PER THE PAST FEW DAYS...CONVECTION IS DIURNAL 
IN NATURE AND SHOULD DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET. BIGGEST CONCERN WILL BE 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN WITH PWATS AT OR ABOVE 2 INCHES AND A VIRTUALLY 
NON EXISTENT FLOW. AXIS REMAINS OVER THE AREA FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS WITH COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE AND CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE 
AIR. WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR 
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS BUT ACTIVITY ONCE AGAIN WILL BE DIURNAL IN 
NATURE. 

UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN MISSISSIPPI WITH A 
RATHER COMPACT UPPER LOW JUST NORTH OF CALGARY IN SOUTHERN ALBERTA 
PROVENCE. RIDGE FORECAST TO SLOWLY RETROGRADE THROUGH THE DAY MONDAY 
BEFORE CENTER BECOMES QUASI STATIONARY OVER CENTRAL COLORADO. UPPER 
LOW WILL TRAVEL ALONG THE TOP OF THE EXPANDING RIDGE BEFORE DIVING
SOUTHEAST AND INTO THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES REGION LATE TUESDAY.
WAVE WILL CONTINUE TO SWING EASTWARD WEDNESDAY CARVING OUT A RATHER 
PRONOUNCED EASTERN CONUS TROUGH BY MID JULY STANDARDS. DANGEROUS 
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL PREVAIL OVER THE REGION BY THE END OF THE 
PERIOD. PRECIP CHANCES WILL INCREASE LATE WEDNESDAY AND MCS ACTIVITY 
CAN BE RULED OUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS CONVECTIVE VORT MAX MOVES DOWN 
FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS. QPF FIELDS NOT REALLY PICKING UP ON IT YET 
SO WILL JUST CARRY SCATTERED POPS FOR NOW BUT PATTERN DOES LOOK 
FAVORABLE FOR MCS DEVELOPMENT AT THAT TIME.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...MODELS CONTINUE THEIR TREND OF RAISING 
HEIGHTS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS. GOOD SURFACE BASED SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST 
FLOW DEVELOPS MONDAY AND TUESDAY THANKS TO SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
SITTING IN THE GULF. TUESDAY APPEARS TO BE THE HOTTEST DAY OF THE 
WEEK WITH MID TO UPPER 90S COMMON. WITH DEW POINTS IN THE MID 70S...
HEAT INDICES MAY EXCEED ADVISORY CRITERIA. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO 
SEE HEADLINES ON THIS DAY. SLIGHTLY COOLER WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS 
SURFACE FLOW TAKES ON MORE OF A NORTHERLY COMPONENT.
&&

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...
EXTENDED RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN REASONABLY ENOUGH AGREEMENT 
AND SUPPORT THE SAME TRENDS AS THE GOING FORECAST. NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW REGIME WILL CONTINUE BEYOND SUNDAY. 

STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE PRESSED UP AGAINST SOUTHWESTERN 
RIDGE...WITH H5 NORTHWESTERLY FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA AT THE 
BEGINNING OF THE EXTENDED PERIODS. THIS WILL BE THE SET UP FOR A 
SERIES OF MESOSCALE COMPLEXES TO SWING DOWN IN THE FLOW ACROSS 
ARKANSAS. THIS SCENARIO WILL BE MOST LIKELY THURSDAY NIGHT...AND 
AGAIN ON FRIDAY NIGHT.

FRONT WILL NOT MAKE MUCH OF A PROGRESSION THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF 
THE WEEKEND...AND MAY EVENTUALLY WASH OUT TO THE SOUTH OF ARKANSAS. 
INDICATIONS ARE THAT UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWEST MAY FLATTEN OUT 
ENOUGH TO PUSH ANOTHER COLD FRONT TOWARD THE AREA BY SUNDAY.

JUST A FEW CLOUDS ARE INDICATED ON THE IR SATELLITE IMAGES THIS 
MORNING ACROSS NORTHWEST AND SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS. STRONG SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER ALABAMA HAS KEPT THE WEATHER QUIET OVERNIGHT. 
THIS HIGH PRESSURE WILL ALSO KEEP THUNDERSTORM CHANCES LIMITED TO 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING TIMEFRAMES INTO THE EARLY PART OF THIS WEEK. 
THIS MID LEVEL RIDGE FORMS QUITE A GRIP ON THE MIDDLE PART OF THE 
COUNTRY THIS WEEK. WARMER TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED FOR MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY AS THE RIDGE MOVES WEST...MANY AREAS WILL EXPERIENCE 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 90S. BY TUESDAY THE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
BECOMES CENTERED OVER COLORADO. THE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH THE UPCOMING WEEK. 

AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL SLIDE INTO THE GREAT LAKES AREA HOWEVER 
ON WEDNESDAY AND THIS WILL BRING A COLD FRONT TOWARD 
ARKANSAS...INCREASING CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE 
FRONT MAY GET HUNG UP IN ARKANSAS...GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE 
TO THE WEST. NORTHWEST FLOW RETURNS TO ARKANSAS LATE WEDNESDAY AND 
THIS WILL ALLOW SHORT WAVES TO TRAVERSE THE AREA AS WELL AS MCS 
ACTIVITY. NORTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES INTO SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
ALL SHORT RANGE MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON WITH REGARDS 
TO BOTH CONSISTENCY AND TIMING OF THE PRIMARY PLAYERS. WITH ONLY 
DISCRETE DIFFERENCES NOTED...FEEL A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS IS WARRANTED.

MODELS HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING A MAJOR PATTERN CHANGE LATELY AND ALL 
INDICATIONS ARE IT IS WELL UNDERWAY. WEAK ZONAL FLOW THAT PERSISTED 
MOST OF LAST WEEK IS BECOMING HIGHLY AMPLIFIED FOR MID JULY. WEAK 
SHEER AXIS THAT WAS LOCATED ALONG THE TEXAS/ARKANSAS BORDER ALL BUT 
DISSIPATED AT THIS TIME. DIURNAL CONVECTION ALREADY UNDERWAY IN THE 
MOIST AND CONDITIONALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS. DYNAMICS ARE SORELY 
LACKING ACROSS THE AREA AND WHILE A FEW STORMS MAY PULSE UP AND 
BECOME BRIEFLY STRONG...NO WIDESPREAD SEVER WEATHER IS EXPECTED. 
BIGGEST CONCERN WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AS THESE STORMS WILL BE 
SLOW MOVERS WITH PWATS HOVERING AROUND 2 INCHES. PRECIPITATION WILL 
BE DIURNAL IN NATURE AND DRY UP AFTER SUNSET.

UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN CONUS WILL STRENGTHEN AND BECOME THE 
DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE THROUGH MID WEEK. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL CONTINUE IN THE TROPICAL AIRMASS BUT WILL BE DIURNAL IN NATURE 
AS NO SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVES ARE SEEN. RIDGE AXIS ACTUALLY 
RETROGRADES WESTWARD THROUGH THE WEEK. RIDGE AXIS POKES UP INTO THE 
CANADIAN PRAIRIE PROVINCES ON SUNDAY WHILE AN UPPER LEVEL LOW SWINGS 
IN TO THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST. 

UPPER LOW FORECAST TO MOVE UP AND OVER THE RIDGE...FLATTENING IT 
ONLY BRIEFLY AS IT PASSES THROUGH SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA. ONCE THE 
WAVES CLEARS THE RIDGE...IT DIVES SOUTHEAST AND CARVES OUT AN 
EASTERN CONUS TROF BY THE END OF THE PERIOD AND A RETURN TO THE 
DANGEROUS NORTHWEST FLOW. STRONGER LOOKING SHORTWAVE COMES DOWN IN 
SAID NORTHWEST FLOW LATE WEDNESDAY TO BRING A BETTER CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...MID LEVEL TEMPS SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE MID 
90S AND LOWS IN THE LOWER 70S THIS PERIOD. MAV/FWC NUMBERS ALSO 
FOLLOW THIS SCENARIO AND ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED. DEW POINTS WILL 
BORDER ON THE OPPRESSIVE SIDE WITH HIGH HEAT INDICES. IN OTHER 
WORDS...ITS SUMMER.
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY...
EXTENDED RANGE MODELS IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON. ALL 
POINT TO RETROGRESSION OF LARGE H5 RIDGE CURRENTLY OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS BY MID WEEK.

LOOKS AS THOUGH WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA SOME TIME 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT/EARLY THURSDAY MORNING...BEFORE STALLING OUT TO THE 
SOUTH AND WEST OF ARKANSAS. FRONT COULD REMAIN INVOF EASTERN 
OKLAHOMA DOWN THROUGH SOUTHERN ARKANSAS/NORTHERN LOUISIANA FOR 
SEVERAL DAYS. WITH RIDGE CENTERED MORE TOWARD NEW MEXICO/WEST 
TEXAS...H5 FLOW WILL BE NORTHWESTERLY...WHICH WILL ALLOW SEVERAL 
SHORTWAVES MOVING DOWN THROUGH THE AREA. THIS WOULD BE MORE OF A 
RETURN TO THE NIGHTLY MCS PATTERN THAT WE HAVE GROWN SO USED TO THIS 
SUMMER. 

ONE BENEFIT OF THIS PATTERN WOULD BE NORTHEASTERLY COMPONENT TO 
SURFACE WINDS...WHICH WILL HELP TO BRING TEMPERATURES DOWNWARD FOR 
THE MID TO LATE WEEK TIME FRAME. DONT GET ME WRONG...ITS STILL 
SUMMER...AND TEMPERATURES WILL BE HOT...JUST NOT AS HOT AS THEY WILL 
BE IN THE SHORT TERM.

ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE AND SOUTHERLY FLOW 
WILL CONTINUE INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE EXPECTED. DECENT MOISTURE 
AND AFTERNOON HEATING WILL LEAD TO THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...
MODELS ARE IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON AND ALL ARE 
ADVERTISING A RETURN TO A MORE SUMMER LIKE PATTERN FOR THE PERIOD. 
ONLY DISCERNIBLE DIFFERENCE IS THE MODELS ARE SLIGHTLY FASTER WITH 
THE FEATURES VERSUS PREVIOUS RUNS BUT SINCE ALL MODELS ARE PICKING 
UP ON THIS TREND...WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF ETA/GFS SOLUTIONS THIS 
AFTERNOON.

LAST NIGHTS MCS DEVELOPED PRETTY MUCH ON SCHEDULE OVER CENTRAL 
NEBRASKA BEFORE SPLITTING IN HALF. PIECES OF THE COMPLEX MOVED DUE 
EAST AND SOUTHWEST...BASICALLY MISSING THE ENTIRE CWA. COMPLEX DID 
LAY DOWN A NICE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ACROSS THE NORTH TO GO ALONG WITH 
THE NUMEROUS BOUNDARIES LURKING ABOUT FROM YESTERDAYS CONVECTION. 
APPEARS THE AIR MASS HAS RECOVERED WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS STILL 
POPPING UP ACROSS THE NORTH. WITH SEVERAL VORTICITY MAXIMA FORECAST 
TO MOVE SLOWLY THROUGH THE WEAK FLOW...WILL NEED TO KEEP SCATTERED 
POPS IN THE FORECAST THIS EVENING. 

UPPER LEVEL WEAKNESS ALONG THE EASTERN TEXAS BORDER...DEPICTED QUITE 
WELL ON THE MODELS...WILL HELP ENHANCE PRECIP CHANCES TONIGHT. 
FEATURE WASHES OUT EARLY SATURDAY WITH MID LEVEL HEIGHTS STARTING TO 
BUILD. TROPICAL RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD IN EARNEST OVER THE SOUTHERN 
AND CENTRAL CONUS AS EXTENSION OF THE BERMUDA HIGH MOVES IN ACROSS 
THE SOUTHEAST CONUS. RIDGE WILL REMAIN LOCKED IN OVER THE WEEKEND 
WITH CHANNELED VORTICITY STRETCHED OUT FROM CENTRAL TEXAS... ACROSS 
NORTHWEST ARKANSAS AND INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. WITH PLENTY OF DEEP
SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE TRAPPED BENEATH THE RIDGE...DIURNAL SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE BUT ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS CAN BE 
JUSTIFIED OVER THE WEEKEND.

UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES ONSHORE OVER THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST SATURDAY 
AND MOVES EASTWARD...UP AND OVER THE EXPANDING SUB TROPICAL RIDGE. 
LOW THEN DROPS INTO SOUTHERN ONTARIO AND CARVES OUT A WEAK TROF OVER 
THE OHIO VALLEY. TROF EFFECTIVELY PUSHES THE CENTER OF THE RIDGE TO 
THE WEST AND ALLOWS IMPULSES TO SLIDE DOWN THE EASTERN PERIPHERY ON 
WEAK NORTHWEST FLOW. DIURNAL PRECIPITATION WILL ONCE AGAIN HAVE TO 
BE ACCOUNTED FOR.

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...BOTH FWC AND MAV NUMBERS SHOW A GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND WITH THE BUILDING SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. SEE NO REASON TO 
ARGUE HERE AND WILL GO WITH A BLEND OF GUIDANCE THIS AFTERNOON. 
BOTTOM LINE WILL BE A STRETCH OF HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS WITH ONLY 
DIURNAL PRECIPITATION TO COOL THINGS DOWN.
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...
THIS NORTHWEST FLOW WILL CONTINUE THROUGH ALL OF THE LONG RANGE... 
SETTING UP THE POSSIBILITY OF BRIEF BOUTS OF CONVECTION FIRING UP 
EACH TIME A SHORT WAVE SLIDES DOWN THE EDGE OF THE RIDGE. A SURFACE 
RIDGE WILL BE GAINING STRENGTH GRADUALLY...PUSHING A WEAK FRONT INTO 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS THURSDAY AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY MORNING. HIGH WILL 
STRETCH FROM THE UPPER MID-WEST THROUGH THE PLAINS FOR THE WEEK 
END...WITH ANOTHER FRONT ABOUT TO ENTER THE STATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 
SURFACE RIDGE WILL KNOCK BACK HUMIDITIES TO BRING SOME RELIEF FROM 
THE MUGGY CONDITIONS. ALSO...A NORTHEASTERLY COMPONENT TO THE WIND 
WILL HELP TO HOLD TEMPERATURES IN THE NEAR NORMAL RANGE...RATHER 
THAN GETTING OPPRESSIVELY ABOVE NORMAL.

NIGHTS CONVECTION OVER ARKANSAS LAID DOWN NUMEROUS BOUNDARIES AND

THIS AFTERNOON CWA WIDE. OTHER CHANGES INCLUDE INCREASING QPF AND 
LOWERING MAX TEMPS AS THICK CLOUD COVER HAS INHIBITED TEMPERATURES 
JUST A BIT.

UPDATED FORECAST TO PUT HIGHER CHANCES FOR RAIN IN MOST 
AREAS...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE STATE. UPPED 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS AS WELL. 

MCS CONTINUES TO HEAD TOWARD CENTRAL ARKANSAS THIS EVENING FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. NOTICE THAT OUTFLOW STARTING TO OUTRUN LINE OF 
STORMS...SO WOULD EXPECT SOME WEAKENING TO OCCUR. THIS ALONG WITH 
WEAK WINDS ALOFT WOULD SUPPORT ONLY ISOLATED SEVERE WEATHER.

PRECIPITATION SHOULD PRETTY MUCH FALL APART AFTER MIDNIGHT. CLOUDS 
WILL ALSO THIN OUT...WITH PATCHY FOG FORMING.

810 PM CDT THU JUL 8 2004

.DISCUSSION...
UPDATED FORECAST TO PUT HIGHER CHANCES FOR RAIN IN MOST 
AREAS...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHWEST HALF OF THE STATE. UPPED 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS AS WELL. 

MCS CONTINUES TO HEAD TOWARD CENTRAL ARKANSAS THIS EVENING FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. NOTICE THAT OUTFLOW STARTING TO OUTRUN LINE OF 
STORMS...SO WOULD EXPECT SOME WEAKENING TO OCCUR. THIS ALONG WITH 
WEAK WINDS ALOFT WOULD SUPPORT ONLY ISOLATED SEVERE WEATHER.

PRECIPITATION SHOULD PRETTY MUCH FALL APART AFTER MIDNIGHT. CLOUDS 
WILL ALSO THIN OUT...WITH PATCHY FOG FORMING. 

THANKS TO SPC FOR COORDINATION. (46)

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...
MCS FROM SOUTHEAST KANSAS MOVING INTO SOUTHWEST MISSOURI AND
WILL EVENTUALLY HEAD INTO NORTHWEST ARKANSAS BY THIS EVENING.
MEANWHILE...SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WORKING NORTHWARD
FROM LOUISIANA. WILL KEEP CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION THIS
EVENING IN NORTHERN COUNTIES AND ALSO IN SOUTH. ONLY
ISOLATED PRECIPITATION IN CENTRAL SECTIONS OF STATE. ALL
PRECIPITATION PRETTY MUCH GONE BY MIDNIGHT.

WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE/SHEAR AXIS WILL CONTINUE FROM
TEXAS INTO NORTHERN/WESTERN ARKANSAS THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO WEST. WITH HIGH NOT QUITE TAKING
OVER YET...WILL KEEP SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS IN THE
FORECAST FRIDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING.

OVER THE WEEKEND...SHEAR AXIS GONE WITH HIGH PRESSURE FIRMLY IN
CONTROL OF WEATHER PATTERN. ONLY ISOLATED AFTERNOON AND EVENING
THUNDER EXPECTED...WITH DRY/HOT CONDITIONS. (46)
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
SEE NO REASON TO MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED FORECAST
TODAY. MAIN REASON...H5 RIDGE WILL BE PREDOMINANT THROUGHOUT MUCH OF
THE PERIOD. SOUTHWESTERLY/SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL BE NOTED AT THE
SURFACE...KEEPING TEMPERATURES WARM. SEVERAL WEAKNESSES IN THE UPPER
FLOW WILL MOVE THROUGH...BUT WITH MOISTURE BEING MARGINAL...AND LACK
OF A LARGE SCALE FOCUSING MECHANISM...ANY CONVECTION WILL BE
ISOLATED AND DIURNAL IN NATURE.

BY WEDNESDAY...UPPER RIDGE WILL SINK SOUTHWARD AND MAY EVEN SHOW A
LITTLE RETROGRESSION. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL SET UP ACROSS
NORTHERN ARKANSAS. THIS WILL ALLOW SEVERAL IMPULSES TO MOVE DOWN IN
THE MEAN FLOW...KEEPING A CONTINUED CHANCE OF AFTERNOON AND EVENING
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST.

BY THURSDAY...NORTHWESTERLY FLOW AT THE UPPER LEVELS MAY ALLOW A
SURFACE FRONT TO PUSH INTO THE AREA. HOWEVER...SOLUTIONS ARE ALWAYS
A BIT IFFY THIS FAR OUT. WITH PERSISTENT SUMMERTIME PATTERN FOR MUCH
OF THE PERIOD...WILL CONTINUE CURRENT POP AND SENSIBLE WEATHER
TRENDS OF DIURNAL ACTIVITY. MADE VERY LITTLE CHANGES TO

LOOKING FOR MAINLY STRONG/DAMAGING WINDS.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY
BROAD RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES THIS MORNING...WITH MAIN 
AREA OF ACTIVITY JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE STATE. A WARM FRONT IS 
CURRENTLY IN SOUTHERN MISSOURI...AND WILL NOT MOVE MUCH TODAY. 
OVERNIGHT...TWO SMALL THUNDERSTORM COMPLEXES DEVELOPED IN EASTERN 
KANSAS AND WEST CENTRAL MISSOURI...AND WILL CONTINUE THEIR TREK 
SOUTHEAST. 

MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT CONCERNING TODAY...BEFORE DIFFERING IN THE 
FORECAST FOR FRIDAY. BOTH THE ETA AND GFS SHOW THUNDERSTORM 
COMPLEXES MOVING SOUTHEAST AND JUST REACHING NORTHERN ARKANSAS 
TODAY. SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP IN THE NORTH TODAY DUE 
TO THE COMPLEXES MOVING SOUTHEAST...AND THE ASSOCIATED OUTFLOWS 
INITIATING CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. WARM AND UNSTABLE AIR REMAINS 
OVER THE ENTIRE STATE...SO CAN NOT RULE OUT ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER 
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AS WELL.

UPPER RIDGE TRIES TO MOVE OVER THE MID SOUTH TONIGHT AND 
FRIDAY...BUT CIRCULATION OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL MOVE TO THE 
NORTHWEST OVER TEXAS. ALSO...NEW ETA RUN TRYING TO DEVELOP ANOTHER 
MCS OVER THE PLAINS AND MOVES IT TO THE SOUTHEAST. DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY IN MODEL SOLUTIONS...HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE GOING 
THROUGH TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS IN THE NORTH 
TONIGHT.

THE WEAKNESS IN THE UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES INTO THE WEEKEND...WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS CONTINUING. HOWEVER...MUCH OF THE ACTIVITY LOOKS 
TO BE DIURNAL IN NATURE.

AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES GO...MOST READINGS WILL REMAIN NEAR NORMAL. 
LOWERED TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES TODAY IN THE NORTH DUE TO CLOUD 
COVER AND RAINFALL...BUT OVERALL GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK GOOD.
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
UPPER RIDGE WILL DOMINATE THE AREA WITH FAIRLY TYPICAL SUMMER
WEATHER. KEPT MENTION OF ISOLATED AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. NEW GFS SHOWS RIDGE RETROGRADING TO THE WEST AND
DANGEROUS NORTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPING OVER THE AREA AROUND MIDWEEK
WITH A WEAK FRONT MOVING THROUGH. DID NOT MAKE ANY CHANGES TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THIS TODAY SINCE IT WILL MAINLY BE ON DAY 7 AND
BEYOND AND PROGGED PATTERN LIKELY WILL CHANGE A FEW TIMES BEFORE IT

LOOKS LIKE THE ETA HAS A BETTER HANDLE ON THE CURRENT SITUATION 
VERSUS THE OTHER SHORT RANGE MODELS. ETA ALSO HAS BEEN MORE 
CONSISTENT THAN THE OTHER MODELS OF LATE AND IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT 
WITH THE CANADIAN VERSUS THE GFS. THERE ARE SOME SUBTLE DIFFERENCES 
IN THE STRENGTH AND TIMING OF SHORTWAVES LATE IN THE PERIOD BUT ALL 
BEING SAID...WILL LEAN TOWARDS A ETA SOLUTION THIS AFTERNOON. 

UNSETTLED WEATHER TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS TONIGHT. 
LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES FRONTAL BOUNDARY RIGHT ALONG THE 
ARKANSAS/MISSOURI BORDER. FRONT DIFFICULT TO PICK UP WITH NUMEROUS 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM ONGOING CONVECTION. CLOUD TEMPERATURES WITH 
THE MCS THAT MOVED INTO EASTERN OKLAHOMA/SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS CONTINUE

DISCERNIBLE. OTHER STORMS CONTINUE TO FIRE UP ON THE AFOREMENTIONED 
OUTFLOW OR IN THE IN THE WARM AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS SOUTH OF THE 
FRONT. WOULD EXPECT MOST OF THIS PRECIPITATION TO DISSIPATE AFTER 
SUNSET AND WILL TREND POPS DOWNWARD THIS EVENING.

OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN CHARACTERIZED BY ACTIVE NORTHERN BRANCH 
OF THE WESTERLIES AND SEVERAL STRONG UPPER LOWS TRAVERSING THE 
UNITED STATES/CANADIAN BORDER. STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL 
REMAIN OVER THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES WITH THE OCCASIONAL WEAKNESS

NORTHERN COUNTIES. WILL GO HIGH SCATTERED HERE AND LOW SCATTERED OR 
SLIGHT CHANCE ELSEWHERE AS TOO MUCH MOISTURE AND TWO MANY BOUNDARIES 
REMAIN TO COMPLETELY REMOVE IT.

FRONT MOVES BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT THURSDAY AND UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGING WILL DOMINATE. ENOUGH MOISTURE WILL REMAIN TRAPPED 
BENEATH THE RIDGE THAT DIURNAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE. MODELS GENERATE AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE OVER THE TEXAS

SOUTH OF KFYV. NOT EXPECTING THIS FEATURE TO MAKE MUCH MORE OF A 
SOUTHERN PUSH BEFORE STARTING TO RETREAT BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM 
FRONT. FRONT WILL STILL ACT AS A FOCUS POINT FOR AFTERNOON 
CONVECTION.

MCS STILL CONTINUING OVER EASTERN OKLAHOMA AND SOUTHWEST ARKANSAS. 
CLOUD TOPS HAVE BEEN WARMING AND COMPLEX DECREASING IN SIZE AND 
INTENSITY BUT WILL STILL NEED TO UPDATE TO REFLECT CURRENT 
TRENDS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTH. OTHERWISE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE FORMING IN THE WARM AND UNSTABLE AIR TO THE SOUTH 
OF THE FRONT AND ALONG OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED 
MCS. WILL NEED TO BOOST POPS ACROSS THE BOARD AS SCATTERED DIURNAL 
CONVECTION SEEMS LIKE A PRETTY GOOD BET...ESPECIALLY WITH ANY BREAKS 
IN THE CLOUD COVER. 

TEMPERATURES LOOK REASONABLE AND WILL BE LEFT ALONE BUT WILL 
CONTINUE TO MONITOR AND MAY NEED TO LOWER THEM LATER IF AIRMASS CAN 
NOT RECOVER FROM PRECIPITATION AND CLOUDS DO NOT BREAK UP.

FRONT IN RIGHT ALONG MISSOURI/ARKANSAS BORDER AND INTO CENTRAL 
OKLAHOMA...WITH LOWER DEWPOINTS AND LIGHT NORTH WINDS NORTH OF THE 
FRONT. SOUPY AIR SOUTH OF THE FRONT...WITH DEWPOINTS ACROSS MUCH OF 
ARKANSAS IN THE UPPER 60S TO THE MID 70S. THUNDERSTORMS ALREADY 
UNDER WAY ALONG THE FRONT IN CENTRAL OKLAHOMA.

FRONT WILL NOT MAKE MUCH MORE OF A PUSH INTO ARKANSAS AS UPPER 
TROUGH AXIS HAS MOVED EAST OF THE AREA. HOWEVER...WITH THE WARM 
UNSTABLE AIR ACROSS THE STATE...THE FRONT WILL HELP INITIATE 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY.

THE FRONT WILL BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY 
EVENING...AND THEN BEGIN TO MOVE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT THURSDAY. 
MODELS INDICATING ANOTHER MCS WILL DEVELOP IN THE PLAINS TONIGHT 
...AND MOVE SOUTHEAST TO NEAR THE ARKANSAS MISSOURI BORDER. WHILE 
MOST OF THE STRONGER STORMS WILL BE TO THE NORTHWEST OF 
ARKANSAS...COULD SEE A LARGE HAIL/STRONG WIND EVENT ACROSS THE 
NORTH. RIGHT NOW...BELIEVE THAT THIS WILL BE MORE OF A HEAVY RAIN 
EVENT...DUE TO THE LARGE AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE. HAVE RAISED AVERAGE 
QPF AMOUNTS FOR TONIGHT/THURSDAY MORNING. COULD SEE SOME ISOLATED 
AMOUNTS OF UP TO 2 INCHES IN THE NORTH IF THE MCS TRACKS FAR ENOUGH 
TO THE SOUTH.

SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL KEEP MOISTURE ACROSS THE STATE FOR THE END OF 
THE WEEK. IN THE TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN...DIURNAL CONVECTION 
WILL KEEP SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST FOR THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENINGS THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.

TEMPERATURES WILL SIMILAR TO TUESDAY...WITH MOST LOCATIONS SLIGHTLY 
BELOW NORMAL. AS RIDGE GETS ESTABLISHED OVER AREA...TEMPERATURES 
WILL CLIMB INTO THE LOWER TO MID 90S IN MOST AREAS BY SATURDAY.

UPPER RIDGE TAKES HOLD OVER THE AREA DURING THE PERIOD BUT THERE ARE

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHOTS OF ENERGY WILL CONTINUE MOVING ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY NORTH OF ARKANSAS...WITH ONLY MINOR SHORT WAVES AFFECTING 
OUR STATE. WEAK FEATURES ALOFT WILL CONTINUE PUSHING A FRONT SLOWLY 
TO THE SOUTHEAST ON TUESDAY. THE FRONT WILL LOSE ITS OOMPH TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. LIGHT SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS WILL COME 
AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF SURFACE HIGH TO OUR EAST THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THIS WILL TEND TO KEEP MOISTURE AVAILABLE FOR DIURNAL 
CONVECTION AFTER THE FRONT STALLS WEDNESDAY. LOWS WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE WARMER THAN MOS NUMBERS ON ACCOUNT OF THE HIGHER DEWPOINTS WE 
HAVE BEEN HAVING. HIGHS WILL KEEP IN THE NEAR 90 TO LOWER 90S RANGE 
AS HEATING WILL CREATE CUMULUS FIELDS EACH AFTERNOON...TENDING TO 
HOLD DOWN THE AFTERNOON MAXES ALONG WITH THE SCATTERED OR WIDELY 
SCATTERED CONVECTION.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY...
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE 
OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN AND A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS WILL BE USED.
MODELS CONTINUE THEIR TREND OF RETURNING TO A MORE SUMMER LIKE 
PATTERN FOR THE MID SOUTH. NORTHERN BRANCH OF THE WESTERLYS REMAINS 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER STATES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AS THE BERMUDA 
HIGH BUILDS WESTWARD FROM THE SOUTHEAST CONUS. STRONG UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING DEVELOPS IN RESPONSE WITH ABUNDANT TROPICAL MOISTURE TRAPPED 
UNDERNEATH IT. WITH NO SHORTWAVES OF SIGNIFICANCE SEEN AND MID LEVEL 
TEMPERATURES ON THE WARM SIDE...ANY PRECIPITATION WOULD HAVE TO BE 
DIURNAL IN NATURE. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ARE JUSTIFIED WITH 
TEMPERATURES VERY CLOSE TO SEASONAL NORMS. MEX NUMBERS SUPPORT THIS 
AND ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

205 PM CDT MON JUL  5 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT
THE MOST SIGNIFICANT SHOTS OF ENERGY WILL CONTINUE MOVING ACROSS THE 
COUNTRY NORTH OF ARKANSAS...WITH ONLY MINOR SHORT WAVES AFFECTING 
OUR STATE. WEAK FEATURES ALOFT WILL CONTINUE PUSHING A FRONT SLOWLY 
TO THE SOUTHEAST ON TUESDAY. THE FRONT WILL LOSE ITS OOMPH TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. LIGHT SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS WILL COME 
AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF SURFACE HIGH TO OUR EAST THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THIS WILL TEND TO KEEP MOISTURE AVAILABLE FOR DIURNAL 
CONVECTION AFTER THE FRONT STALLS WEDNESDAY. LOWS WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE WARMER THAN MOS NUMBERS ON ACCOUNT OF THE HIGHER DEWPOINTS WE 
HAVE BEEN HAVING. HIGHS WILL KEEP IN THE NEAR 90 TO LOWER 90S RANGE 
AS HEATING WILL CREATE CUMULUS FIELDS EACH AFTERNOON...TENDING TO 
HOLD DOWN THE AFTERNOON MAXES ALONG WITH THE SCATTERED OR WIDELY 
SCATTERED CONVECTION.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY MORNING THROUGH MONDAY...
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE 
OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN AND A BLEND OF SOLUTIONS WILL BE USED.
MODELS CONTINUE THEIR TREND OF RETURNING TO A MORE SUMMER LIKE 
PATTERN FOR THE MID SOUTH. NORTHERN BRANCH OF THE WESTERLYS REMAINS 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER STATES THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AS THE BERMUDA 
HIGH BUILDS WESTWARD FROM THE SOUTHEAST CONUS. STRONG UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING DEVELOPS IN RESPONSE WITH ABUNDANT TROPICAL MOISTURE TRAPPED 
UNDERNEATH IT. WITH NO SHORTWAVES OF SIGNIFICANCE SEEN AND MID LEVEL 
TEMPERATURES ON THE WARM SIDE...ANY PRECIPITATION WOULD HAVE TO BE 
DIURNAL IN NATURE. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ARE JUSTIFIED WITH 
TEMPERATURES VERY CLOSE TO SEASONAL NORMS. MEX NUMBERS SUPPORT THIS 
AND ARE GENERALLY ACCEPTED.

UPDATE IS OUT ALREADY TO TAKE CARE OF THE HOUSEKEEPING WITH THE 
WATCHES. ALSO...REMOVED THE SMALL POPS ACROSS THE NORTH IN LIGHT OF
LITTLE RADAR ACTIVITY OVER THAT PART OF THE STATE. 

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY
UPPER RIDGE HAS BUILT INTO THE AREA TEMPORARILY WHICH HAS BROUGHT 
WARM AIR ALOFT AND A CAP. THIS SHOULD INHIBIT CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT 
OVER THE AREA TODAY BUT THERE IS STILL CONCERN ABOUT EFFECTS OF 
THUNDERSTORMS IN SOUTHERN KANSAS AND NORTHERN OKLAHOMA THIS MORNING. 
THE UPPER FLOW SHOULD KEEP THIS TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA BUT WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH THIS MORNING JUST IN CASE. WILL 
LEAVE THE REST OF THE AREA DRY TODAY FOR NOW. SOUTHWEST SURFACE FLOW 
SHOULD ALLOW MOST OF THE AREA TO WARM INTO THE 90S BUT MAY STAY A 
LITTLE BELOW GUIDANCE DUE TO WET SOIL FROM RECENT RAINS. THE HIGH 
HUMIDITY LEFT OVER WILL BRING HEAT INDEX VALUES CLOSE TO 105 IN 
PARTS OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL MENTION 
THAT IN THOSE ZONES. WILL KEEP THINGS DRY TONIGHT BUT TROFFING ALOFT 
DEVELOPS TO THE WEST BY TUESDAY MORNING AND A SHORT WAVE WILL 
APPROACH. THIS COULD GENERATE SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE 
WEST MONDAY NIGHT WHICH COULD REACH THE CWA EARLY TUESDAY...SO HAVE 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS STARTING IN THE MORNING THEN INCREASED POPS IN 
THE NORTH DURING THE AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT SHOULD BE NEARING 
THAT AREA. KEPT CHANCE POPS GOING TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS THE 
UPPER FLOW LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BUCKLE ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE FRONT TO 
MOVE INTO THE AREA. THE FRONT MAY RETREAT NORTH BY THURSDAY AS THE 
SURFACE HIGH SHIFTS OFF TO THE EAST AND UPPER RIDGING BEGINS TO 
BUILD BACK IN. MOISTURE REMAINS IN THE AREA SO WENT WITH CHANCE POPS 
FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON. MAXES WILL BE LOWER TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
DUE TO INCREASED CLOUDS AND THE PRESENCE OF THE FRONT. WARMER MINS 
MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 70S SHOULD CONTINUE AS DEW POINTS REMAIN HIGH.

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
BERMUDA HIGH SETS UP IN THE EXTENDED...WHICH WILL BRING A TYPICAL 
SUMMERTIME PATTERN TO ARKANSAS. MOISTURE WILL BE ABUNDANT...WITH

.DISCUSSION...
LOOKS LIKE MCS IS HOLDING TOGETHER AS IT APPROACHES THE CWA. DUE TO
THE INCREASED CONFIDENCE IT WILL MAKE IT IN...INCREASED POPS TO 40
PERCENT IN THE NORTH FOR MID TO LATE MORNING. CONFIDENCE DECREASES 
AFTER THAT SO PUT IN 30 POPS IN NORTHERN THIRD AT NOON WITH 20
PERCENT ELSEWHERE THEN GRADUALLY WENT TO BROAD BRUSH 20 PERCENT 
FROM MID AFTERNOON ON. INCREASED CLOUD COVER A LITTLE AS WELL. 
DID NOT CHANGE TEMP FORECASTS ALTHOUGH IT IS LOOKING MORE LIKELY
TEMPS WILL BE IMPACTED AT LEAST IN THE NORTHWEST. 

.PREV DISCUSSION...
.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
SUMMER TO RETURN TO THE AREA TODAY FOR THE MOST PART. MAIN FLY IN
THE OINTMENT WILL BE WHAT EFFECTS THE ONGOING MCS IN KANSAS MAY HAVE
ON THE AREA LATER TODAY. MODELS HAVE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND NONE SEEM
TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON IT. WENT WITH COMPROMISE OF POSSIBILITIES.
STARTED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH AT MID MORNING AND SLOWLY
EXPANDED THEM ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS. WAS NOT GOING TO FORECAST
A CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE SOUTHERN HALF...BUT DUE TO POSSIBILITY OF
OUTFLOW FROM MCS MOVING INTO THOSE AREAS...DECIDED TO PUT IN SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. UPPER RIDGING IN THE AREA

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
650 AM CDT SUN JUL 4 2004

.DISCUSSION...
LOOKS LIKE MCS IS HOLDING TOGETHER AS IT APPROACHES THE CWA. DUE TO
THE INCREASED CONFIDENCE IT WILL MAKE IT IN...INCREASED POPS TO 40
PERCENT IN THE NORTH FOR MID TO LATE MORNING. CONFIDENCE DECREASES 
AFTER THAT SO PUT IN 30 POPS IN NORTHERN THIRD AT NOON WITH 20
PERCENT ELSEWHERE THEN GRADUALLY WENT TO BROAD BRUSH 20 PERCENT 
FROM MID AFTERNOON ON. INCREASED CLOUD COVER A LITTLE AS WELL. 
DID NOT CHANGE TEMP FORECASTS ALTHOUGH IT IS LOOKING MORE LIKELY
TEMPS WILL BE IMPACTED AT LEAST IN THE NORTHWEST. 

.PREV DISCUSSION...
.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
SUMMER TO RETURN TO THE AREA TODAY FOR THE MOST PART. MAIN FLY IN
THE OINTMENT WILL BE WHAT EFFECTS THE ONGOING MCS IN KANSAS MAY HAVE
ON THE AREA LATER TODAY. MODELS HAVE DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS AND NONE SEEM
TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON IT. WENT WITH COMPROMISE OF POSSIBILITIES.
STARTED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH AT MID MORNING AND SLOWLY
EXPANDED THEM ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS. WAS NOT GOING TO FORECAST
A CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE SOUTHERN HALF...BUT DUE TO POSSIBILITY OF
OUTFLOW FROM MCS MOVING INTO THOSE AREAS...DECIDED TO PUT IN SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. UPPER RIDGING IN THE AREA 
MAY SERVE TO CAP THE SOUTH BUT WITH IT BEING A HOLIDAY DECIDED TO

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
REMNANTS OF MCS CONTS WORKING ACRS CNTRL AR ATTM. LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINS CONTS TO AFFECT PARTS OF THE FA AS WELL. LOOKS LIKE BULK OF 
ACTIVITY SHOULD BE OVER ERN AR BY EARLY THIS EVENING AND WILL MAKE 
FINAL DECISION ON EVENING POPS JUST BEFORE ZONE ISSUANCE.

UPPER SYSTEM CENTERED OVER ERN KS THIS AFTN IS PROGGED TO SHIFT EWD 
OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. MEANWHILE...ANOTHER COMPLEX OF STORMS IS 
FCST FORM TO OUR NW LATER THIS EVENING AS MORE ENERGY ROTATES AROUND 
THE UPPER LOW. ACTIVITY IS PROGGED TO WORK SEWD LATE TONIGHT AND SAT 
MRNG...AFFECTING MUCH OF NRN AND CNTRL AR. HAVE STUCK WITH THE 
MESOETA SOLUTION FOR MUCH OF THE SHORT TERM.

AS FOR THE HEAVY RAIN POTENTIAL...APPEARS THAT NRN AND CNTRL 
SECTIONS WILL SEE THE GREATEST THREAT WITH THE NEXT COMPLEX LATER 
TNGT. THUS...PLAN TO EXTEND FF WATCH THRU TNGT FOR NRN AND CNTRL 
SECTIONS AND ALLOW WATCH FOR SRN AR TO EXPIRE AT 00Z.

UPPER SYSTEM MOVES FURTHER AWAY FROM THE FA LATER SAT AND SUN TO 
ALLOW FOR DECREASING POPS. MESOETA STILL SHOWING POSSIBLE REMNANTS 
OF ANOTHER MCS DROPPING SEWD INTO AR BY SUN MNRG. HAVE STUCK WITH 
GOING FCST AND KEPT SLGT CHC POPS TO CLOSE OUT THE WEEKEND.

MOS MIN TEMPS THRU THE PERIOD LOOK GOOD AND PRETTY MUCH FOLLOW 
PERSISTENCE. HAVE GONE BELOW MOS MAX TEMPS FOR SAT WITH EXPECTED 
CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHCS. SWLY SFC FLOW ON SUN WL ALLOW FOR A 
WARMING TREND. MOS OUTPUT INDCG HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 90S FOR 
SUN. THESE READINGS SEEM A LITTLE TOO WARM WITH SOIL MOISTURE QUITE 
HIGH AND HAVE GONE ABOUT A CAT LOWER SUN AND MON.

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
A COLD FRONT WILL ENTER THE NORTHWESTERN SECTIONS OF ARKANSAS EARLY 
WEDNESDAY AND THEN MOVE SLOWLY TOWARDS THE SOUTHEAST. AND BY THURSDAY
MORNING THE COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO BE NEAR THE SOUTHERN ARKANSAS 
BORDER. THIS WILL BRING ABOUT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY. COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL MOVE INTO
THE NORTHERN SECTIONS AFTER THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. BY FRIDAY THE FRONT 
WILL BE QUASI-STATIONARY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ARKANSAS BORDER. THIS 
WILL LIKELY KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS 
MOST OF THE CWA.

MANY AREAS OVER MAINLY SOUTHERN ARKANSAS HAVE SEEN SEVERAL INCHES OF

SOUTHERN ARKANSAS THIS MORNING LEADING TO WIDESPREAD LIGHT RAIN. 
WAVE CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHEAST ARKANSAS WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. 
FLASH FLOODING WAS REPORTED EARLIER TODAY IN BRADLEY COUNTY.

MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A BREAK IN THE ACTION TONIGHT AFTER ANY 
DIURNAL SHOWERS DISSIPATE. WILL ONLY CARRY CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE

UPDATE ON THE WAY THIS MORNING TO LOWER POPS AND QPF FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE DAY. CURRENT RADAR CONTINUES TO SHOW A DECREASING 
TREND WITH THE PRECIPITATION AS DRIER AIR TRIES TO PUNCH IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST. LATEST WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS DRY SLOT ENTERING THE 
EXTREME SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE STATE BUT NOT CONFIDENT HOW FAR IT 
WILL PROGRESS AS LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION IN OKLAHOMA TRIES TO MOVE 
EASTWARD.

NEW MODELS SHUNT ALL THE PRECIPITATION OFF TO THE EAST FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON. STILL SOME SHOWERS POSSIBLE CENTRAL AND NORTH THROUGH THE 
REMAINDER OF THE DAY IN TROPICAL AIRMASS. WITH NO REAL FORCING SEEN 
WILL LOWER POPS ACROSS ALL AREAS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE SOUTH 
WHERE MODELS CONTINUE TO SWING A SHORTWAVE THROUGH. 

WILL ALSO NEED TO LOWER TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO BASED ON CURRENT 
TRENDS AND RAIN COOLED AIR. MODELS CONTINUE TO SWING THE UPPER 
TROUGH THROUGH THE AREA LATE TONIGHT AND FRIDAY SO ONLY A RESPITE 
FROM THE WET WEATHER EXPECTED. MODELS ALSO SPEEDING THE SYSTEM UP

WET PATTERN/LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN WILL CONTINUE AT LEAST THROUGH

TODAY MAY NOT BE AS ACTIVE AS IN PREVIOUS DAYS...WITH PRECIPITATION
NOT AS WIDESPREAD.

SCATTERED PRECIPITATION THAT DEVELOPS THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO DAYTIME
HEATING WILL MOSTLY DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET. MAY ACTUALLY HAVE
MOSTLY QUIET WEATHER DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. HOWEVER...TOWARD
MORNING...NEXT WAVE OF ENERGY FROM OKLAHOMA WILL ARRIVE IN WESTERN

WAVE WILL SPREAD AREA OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE REGION ON
FRIDAY...WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN.

MAIN SYSTEM ALOFT WILL FINALLY GET HERE FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY...WITH
CONTINUED GOOD CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION. AT THE SURFACE...COLD
FRONT WILL PUSH INTO ARKANSAS...WITH ABUNDANT MOISTURE SHUNTED TO THE
EAST.

AS WEEKEND COMES TO A CLOSE...FRONT WILL STALL IN ARKANSAS...BUT
THERE WILL NOT BE AS MUCH MOISTURE. AS A RESULT...ONLY ISOLATED TO
SCATTERED THUNDER WILL POP UP...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING
ON SUNDAY.

DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THROUGH SATURDAY...
BUT WILL WARM UP SUNDAY AS MOISTURE LEVELS DROP/CLOUDS BECOME LESS

AREA AND WILL PROVIDE ADDED LIFT TO KEEP THE PRECIPITATION GOING. 
AREA RADARS CONTINUE TO SHOW A DECREASING TREND IN INTENSITY OF THE 
RAIN...LIKELY FROM THE AIR MASS STABILIZING FROM LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING. HOWEVER...COVERAGE IS THE SAME OR HAS ACTUALLY INCREASED. 
WITH THESE WAVES STILL PROGGED TO COME THOROUGH AND BASED ON CURRENT 
TRENDS...WILL BOOST POPS TO LIKELY ACROSS THE BOARD FOR THE REST OF 
THE NIGHT. WILL ALSO NEED TO TWEAK OTHER GRIDS/ZONES BASED ON OTHER
CURRENT TRENDS AND OBSERVATIONS.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY
LOOKS LIKE A WET WEATHER PATTERN TO BEGIN THE SHORT TERM. FRONT THAT
MOVED INTO ARKANSAS ON MONDAY HAS PRETTY MUCH STALLED IN CENTRAL
SECTIONS OF THE STATE. WEAK ENERGY FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL
INTERACT WITH THE FRONT...WITH SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS POPPING UP THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING.

REPEAT PERFORMANCE ON WEDNESDAY...WITH STRONGER SYSTEM ARRIVING
FROM OKLAHOMA HELPING TO TRIGGER PRECIPITATION.

LZK 00Z SOUNDING NOT SHOWING MUCH OF A STORM MOTION...AND
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL LIKELY BE BETWEEN 1.5 AND 2.0
INCHES. GIVEN THIS...STORMS THAT DEVELOP WILL HAVE A TRNDENCY TO
PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. WILL ADDRESS THIS IN BODY OF FORECAST.

MODEL PRECIPITATION PROBABILITIES A LITTLE HIGH FOR THE MOST PART
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...BUT DEFINITELY GET YOUR ATTENTION.
BOTTOM LINE IS THAT RAIN CHANCES WILL BE INFLATED FOR THIS TIME OF
YEAR...WITH MORE ISOLATED PRECIPITATION THE NORM.

TOWARD THE END OF THE SHORT TERM...NEW COLD FRONT WILL HEAD INTO
ARKANSAS FROM THE NORTHWEST. WHILE IT APPEARS THAT THE FRONT WILL NOT
BE FOLLOWED BY A BIG COOLDOWN...IT WILL SHUNT ABUNDANT MOISTURE TO
THE EAST WITH PRECIPITATION A LITTLE MORE ISOLATED THIS WEEKEND.

AS FAR AS TEMPERATURES IN THE SHORT TERM...CLOUDS/PRECIPITATION WILL
KEEP DAYTIME READINGS BELOW NORMAL. MUGGY AIR/FAIRLY HIGH DEWPOINTS
WILL KEEP READINGS NEAR NORMAL AT NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
UPPER FLOW WILL HAVE A CLOSED LOW OVER THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL FRIDAY
NIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING...WITH THE LOW OPENING AND GETTING
CAUGHT UP IN THE FLOW AROUND THE LOW OVER HUDSON BAY. THIS WILL
LEAVE A SHEAR AXIS THAT WILL SPLIT THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVER THE
LOWER MISS RIVER VALLEY. EVEN WITH WEAK FEATURES AT H5 THERE WILL BE
ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO KEEP SCATTERED PRECIPITATION OVER AR IN THE
LIGHT NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE MAINLY IN

ADVERTISE BROAD TROFFING OVER THE NORTHEAST QUAD OF THE NATION WITH 
RIDGING OVER THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND ANOTHER TROF OFF THE WEST

WITH GFS ONCE AGAIN STRONGER THAN THE ETA COUNTERPART. WILL LEAN 
TOWARDS THE WEAKER ETA THIS AFTERNOON AS OVERALL FLOW LOOKS WEAK AND 
GFS APPEARS TO BE OVERDONE SOMEWHAT.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES WEAK BOUNDARY OVER THE SOUTH BUT 
FEATURE IS BECOMING HARDER AND HARDER TO FIND AND SHOULD BE ALMOST 
COMPLETELY WASHED OUT BY PRESS TIME. MODELS CONTINUE TO PICK UP A 
NEW WAVE THAT WILL TRAVEL ALONG WHATS LEFT OF THE BOUNDARY THIS

FEATURE AND DRIFTING SLOWLY EAST. MEANWHILE...SCATTERED SHOWERS 
CONTINUE TO BREAK OUT IN THE INCREASING MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS 
OVER THE CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE STATE. 

ONLY AREA WHERE PRECIPITATION IS NOT BREAKING OUT IS THE NORTHEAST. 
DEW POINT TEMPERATURES HERE ARE IN THE LOWER 60S VERSUS UPPER 60S OR

FRONT. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE GREATER TO THE SOUTH IN THE 
VICINITY OF THE OLD BOUNDARY.

FRONT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HANG UP OVER THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE
FOR TUESDAY. AIRMASS WILL REMAIN MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE. 
DAYTIME HEATING WILL HELP FIRE UP MORE AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE BEST CHANCES ONCE AGAIN OVER THE SOUTH. 
FRONT WILL BE MOVING BACK TO THE NORTH ON WEDNESDAY BUT AFTERNOON 
ACTIVITY POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN. MODELS DEVELOP A NEW WAVE IN THE

WOULD CLIP NORTHERN ARKANSAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH MORE SHORTWAVE 
ENERGY PROGGED TO COME THROUGH ON THURSDAY. BOTTOM LINE IS A VERY 
UNSETTLED FORECAST WITH AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE

RESPONSIBLE FOR HEAVIER RAIN TO THE SOUTH NOW EAST OF THE AREA BUT 
WEAKER SECONDARY WAVE PROGGED TO COME IN THIS AFTERNOON. 

NUMEROUS BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS NOTED AND AIRMASS DOES DESTABILIZE 
THIS AFTERNOON. WILL CONTINUE CHANCE TO SIGHT CHANCES POPS ACROSS 
THE REGION WITH HIGHEST POPS OVER THE SOUTH. GRIDS/ZONES WILL NEED 
TO BE TWEAKED BUT OVER CHANGE IN SENSIBLE WEATHER WILL BE MINIMAL. 
ALL OTHER FIELDS LOOK GOOD AND WILL BE LEFT IN PLACE.

.PREV DISCUSSION...
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS FAIRLY WIDESPREAD ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS
DURING THE PREDAWN HOURS...BUT WILL BECOME MORE SCATTERED TOWARD
MORNING. PRECIPITATION THE RESULT OF WEAKENING SHORTWAVE FROM
TEXAS INTERACTING WITH OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY.

THE BOUNDARY MANAGED TO LIFT NORTH A BIT IN THE LAST 24 HOURS...
WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S/LOWER 70S IN ABOUT THE SOUTHERN
TWO THIRDS OF THE STATE. CLOSER TO THE MISSOURI BORDER...
DEWPOINTS STILL IN THE UPPER 50S/LOWER 60S. THIS DRY AIR
GREATLY INHIBITED SHOWER DEVELOPMENT ON SUNDAY...WITH ALL
PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES. PRECIPITATION WILL BE
MOST CONCENTRATED OVER CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS TODAY.

OLD BOUNDARY TO THE SOUTH WILL BECOME MORE DIFFUSE TODAY...WITH
NEW COLD FRONT ARRIVING FROM THE NORTHWEST. NEW FRONT WILL BE IN
CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE STATE BY EVENING...AND WILL LIKELY
TRIGGER SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS. HAVE SMALL CHANCES
OF RAIN IN THE NORTH...WITH PROGRESSIVELY GREATER CHANCES
TOWARD THE LOUISIANA BORDER.

KEPT SMALL CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION TONIGHT...AGAIN MAINLY IN
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. FRONT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HANG UP
ACROSS THE CENTRAL COUNTIES DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.

ON TUESDAY...WITH A STALLED FRONT IN PLACE AND WITH SOME HEATING...
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL REFIRE. ISOLATED TO SCATTERED
PRECIPITATION MENTIONED IN THE NORTH...WITH SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS
CELLS CENTRAL/SOUTH.

FRONT WILL LIFT TO THE NORTH WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY. RAIN CHANCES WILL
GO DOWN A BIT...ALLOWING FOR WARMER DAYS.

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS
WITH CLOUDS/SOME PRECIPITATION. READINGS CLOSER TO NORMAL TOWARD
MIDWEEK WITH LESS CLOUDS/PRECIPITATION MORE ISOLATED.

AS A WARM FRONT DEPARTS TO THE NORTH...ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL
ARRIVE THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY FROM THE NORTHWEST. CLOUDS WILL
INCREASE ONCE AGAIN...WITH BETTER CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS.

APPEARS THAT FRONT WILL MOVE JUST TO THE SOUTH OF ARKANSAS
TO BEGIN THE WEEKEND...BUT WILL STALL VERY NEAR THE STATE.
IN MOST OF THE REGION...DRY WEATHER WILL RETURN BEHIND THE
FRONT...BUT IT WILL REMAIN WARM. COULD HAVE ISOLATED THUNDER
IN THE SOUTH NEAR THE FRONT TO CLOSE OUT THE WEEKEND.

RAIN HAS DECREASED MARKEDLY ACROSS THE AREA WITH THE LOSS OF 
HEATING. HOWEVER SHORT WAVE IS MOVING INTO SOUTHWESTERN ARKANSAS
AND AN AREA OF RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS IS SPREADING ACROSS THE SOUTH
IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS. STILL SOME CHANCE OF HEAVY RAINS NEAR THE
TRACK OF THE SHORT WAVE OVERNIGHT SO LEFT FLOOD WATCH INTACT EVEN 
THOUGH CONFIDENCE IS NOT THAT HIGH. DOES LOOK LIKE CHANCE OF FLOOD
PRODUCING RAIN WILL END BY 12Z AS SHORT WAVE MOVES PAST THE AREA. 
LEFT 30 PERCENT POPS IN OTHER AREAS TO ACCOUNT FOR ONGOING ACTIVITY
IN CENTRAL SECTIONS WHILE POPS IN THE NORTH WILL BE IN CASE 
CONVECTION MOVING INTO NORTHEASTERN OKLAHOMA MAKES IT INTO THAT
AREA LATER TONIGHT. MADE SLIGHT DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT TO POPS FOR
MONDAY BUT STILL LOOKS LIKE 40 PERCENT WILL BE JUSTIFIED TO ACCOUNT
FOR COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS MOST OF THE CWA DURING THE DAY. TEMP

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY
DRIER AIR HAS WORKED INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS THIS MORNING FROM THE
NORTH. IN GENERAL...FROM LITTLE ROCK NORTHWARD...DEWPOINTS IN MID
50S/LOWER 60S. FARTHER SOUTH...SCATTERD TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ONGOING...BUT WILL HAVE A
DIFFICULT TIME PUSHING NORTH INTO DRY AIR.

IN FORECAST...HAVE NO RAIN AT ALL MENTIONED TOWARD MISSOURI
BORDER. ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND MAYBE A THUNDERSTORM
WILL OCCUR CLOSER TO LITTLE ROCK...WITH WIDESPREAD
PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.

PRECIPITATION TRIGGERED BY SYSTEM ALOFT ARRIVING FROM TEXAS...WITH
THE SYSTEM INTERACTING WITH A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT IN SOUTHERN
ARKANSAS. NEAR THE FRONT...SOME AREAS COULD RECEIVE 1 TO 2 INCHES
OF RAIN TODAY...WITH A FLASH FLOOD WATCH POSTED.

PATTERN WILL CHANGE VERY LITTLE THROUGH TONIGHT...WITH HIGH CHANCES
OF RAIN IN THE SOUTH...AND LITTLE TO NO CHANCE OF RAIN THE FARTHER
NORTH YOU GO.

ON MONDAY...SYSTEM IN TEXAS WILL FLATTEN WITH PRECIPITATION IN THE
SOUTH BECOMING MORE SCATTERED. APPEARS THAT MCS MAY ARRIVE IN
WEST CENTRAL ARKANSAS IN THE MORNING...AND BUILDING SOUTHEAST AS
IT WEAKENS. SO...CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN IN
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE STATE...WITH ONLY ISOLATED
THUNDER IN THE NORTH.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION FROM THE NORTH
TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY...AND THIS WILL KEEP THE FRONT ACROSS SOUTHERN
ARKANSAS. SEEMS LIKE A BROKEN RECORD...BUT WILL KEEP MENTIONING
SCATTERED PRECIPITATION NEAR THE FRONT...WITH CONTINUED DRY
WEATHER IN THE NORTH.

TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE PERIOD WILL REMAIN AT/BELOW NORMAL.
&&

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
AN UPPER LOW WILL TAKE SHAPE OVER THE CENTRAL ROCKIES BY THE MIDDLE
OF THE WEEK. IT WILL SLIDE SLOWLY TO THE EAST ATTEMPTING TO KNOCK
DOWN THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN TIER OF STATES. THE
RIDGE GIVES UP SOME GROUND WHILE AT THE SAME TIME WEAKENING THE LOW.
TROF WILL BEGIN AFFECTING THE MID SOUTH FRIDAY MORNING AND IT WILL BE
EAST OF ARKANSAS BY 00Z SUNDAY. ONLY A WEAK SHEAR AXIS WILL REMAIN
OVER THE MISS RIVER VALLEY THROUGH 240 HOURS. THE SURFACE PATTERN
WILL BE MARKED BY WEAK FEATURES AS WELL. PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND
ABUNDANT DAYTIME HEATING WILL BE IN PLACE WHEN MINOR RIPPLES MOVE
OVER THE STATE IN ADVANCE OF UPPER TROF...SO WET PATTERN WILL
CONTINUE...ALONG WITH BELOW NORMAL HIGHS AND MUGGY LOWS.

.DISCUSSION...
RAIN HAS DECREASED MARKEDLY ACROSS THE SOUTH AND HAS MOSTLY DISSIPATED
ELSEWHERE. SURFACE RIDGE FROM THE NORTH COVERS THE AREA AND THERE IS
A WEAK 850 MB HIGH IN THE AREA CONTROLLING MOSTLY NORTHERN AND CENTRAL
SECTIONS OF ARKANSAS. HOWEVER THE UPPER LOW OVER TEXAS STILL SHOWS UP
WELL AND HEAVY MOISTURE IS STILL PRESENT ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTH. 
DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE MUCH RAIN IN THE CWA THE NEXT FEW HOURS
BUT AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES CLOSER LATER TONIGHT THINK RAIN COULD 
INCREASE AGAIN IN THE SOUTH OR MOVE IN FROM TEXAS AND LOUISIANA. 
ALSO THINK A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN REMAINS EARLY SUNDAY AS THE UPPER 
LOW MOVES CLOSER AND BEGINS TO SHEAR ACROSS THE AREA. TO ACCOUNT FOR
THIS...LOWERED POPS FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS ACROSS THE AREA...KEEPING
10 PERCENT IN THE NORTH AND 20 PERCENT ACROSS CENTRAL 
SECTIONS...WHICH WAS MAINTAINED FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT. WENT DOWN
TO 30 PERCENT IN SOUTH CENTRAL AND 50 PERCENT IN FAR SOUTH BUT INCREASED
POPS TO 50 PERCENT IN SOUTH CENTRAL AND 70 PERCENT IN FAR SOUTH AFTER
09Z. KEPT POPS AS THEY WERE AFTER 11Z AND THROUGH SUNDAY. LEFT FLOOD
WATCH AS IS EVEN THOUGH THERE SHOULD NOT BE MUCH GOING ON THROUGH MUCH
OF THE NIGHT. DO THINK HEAVY RAIN THREAT WILL RETURN BY MORNING AND
CONTINUE INTO SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
EXCESSIVE RAINFALL POTENTIAL HIGHLIGHTS THE FIRST PART OF THE SHORT 
TERM. FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS HAS ALL BUT STALLED 
OUT IN THE VICINITY OF THE LOUISIANA BORDER. CONVECTION HAS 
DEVELOPED NEAR AND TO THE SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY. THIS TREND WILL 
CONTINUE TONIGHT...WITH ACTIVITY SPREADING NORTHWARD LATE TONIGHT AS 
UPPER LOW OVER TEXAS MOVES NORTHEAST...AND FRONTAL BOUNDARY WOBBLES 
BACK TO THE NORTH SLIGHTLY. 

BY SUNDAY...H5 SYSTEM BECOMES MORE OF AN OPEN WAVE IN THE VICINITY 
OF THE ARKLATEX...WITH SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING ALONG QUASI STATIONARY 
BOUNDARY. AT THIS TIME...LOOKS AS THOUGH THE FOCUS OF HEAVIEST 
PRECIP WILL BE OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS INITIALLY...SHIFTING NORTHWARD 
LATE TONIGHT...THEN EASTWARD AS THE SURFACE AND UPPER SYSTEMS LINE 
UP MORE WITH EACH OTHER AND UPPER DIVERGENCE INTENSIFIES.  

GIVEN THIS...THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN PLACE...SLOW STORM 
MOTION...AND THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS IN THE 
PAST FEW WEEKS...WILL GO AHEAD AND ISSUE A FLASH FLOOD WATCH FOR MY 
SOUTHERN COUNTIES...ROUGHLY SOUTH OF A GLENWOOD...TO MALVERN...TO 
STUTTGART LINE THROUGH TOMORROW. AS FAR AS RAINFALL AMOUNTS...WOULD 
EXPECT TO SEE AVERAGE TOTALS OF ONE TO TWO INCHES...WITH LOCALLY 
HIGHER AMOUNTS. 

BY SUNDAY NIGHT...THE FORECAST AREA MAY GET A LITTLE BREAK...AS 
SURFACE LOW AND H5 SYSTEM MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. HOWEVER...
BOUNDARY WILL STILL BE IN PLACE OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. MODELS ALSO
HINTING AT MCS FORMATION OVER SOUTHERN KANSAS DURING THE NIGHT...OF 
WHICH THE REMAINS WOULD AFFECT NORTHERN ARKANSAS ON MONDAY 
AFTERNOON. MCS FORMATION MAY ALSO OCCUR ON MONDAY NIGHT OVER 
SOUTHERN MISSOURI/NORTHERN ARKANSAS AS SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS. 

BOTTOM LINE...UNSETTLED WEATHER WILL CONTINUE INTO MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY...AS PATTERN SHOWS LITTLE SIGN OF BUDGING. CONDITIONS WILL 
BE PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY THROUGH THE PERIOD...AND TEMPERATURES 
LOOK TO REMAIN WELL BELOW NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

355 AM CDT SAT JUN 26 2004

.SHORT TERM...
FRONT DROPPING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD THROUGH ARKANSAS THIS MORNING...
AND WILL EVENTUALLY SETUP IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE STATE.
SLIGHTLY COOLER/DRIER AIR NORTH OF FRONT...WITH MUGGY
CONDITIONS/LOTS OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FARTHER SOUTH. AREAS
OF FOG FORMING IN CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS DURING THE PREDAWN
HOURS...AND WILL MENTION EARLY IN THE FORECAST.

AROUND FRONT...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
WILL POP UP TODAY. THIS WILL MAINLY BE NOTED IN THE SOUTHERN
COUNTIES. LITTLE TO NO PRECIPITATION MENTIONED NORTH OF
LITTLE ROCK.

FORECAST FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD IN THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS...
THEN IT BECOMES RATHER COMPLEX. FRONT WILL BEGIN SLOWLY
HEADING BACK TO THE NORTH TONIGHT/SUNDAY. DEEP TROUGH OF
LOW PRESSURE IN TEXAS WILL MEANDER TO THE NORTHEAST. MEANWHILE...
ARKANSAS WILL BE CLOSE TO THE EXIT REGION OF A JET TO THE NORTH.
IT ALL ADDS UP TO A LOT OF LIFTING MECHANISMS...AND HEFTY CHANCES
OF RAIN.

FOR TONIGHT...HAVE SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY SOUTH OF LITTLE
ROCK. LIKELY CHANCES SHIFT NORTH/EAST SUNDAY MORNING...WITH ROUGHLY
SOUTHEAST HALF OF THE STATE AFFECTED. GFS INSISTS ON WIDESPREAD 2
INCH PLUS RAINFALL AMOUNTS TONIGHT/SUNDAY. WHILE THIS IS LIKELY
OVERDONE...DID MENTION POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY RAIN CENTRAL/SOUTH
DURING THIS TIME FRAME. WILL LET DAY CREW EVALUATE SITUATION...
WITH FLASH FLOOD WATCH NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.

TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL FLATTEN/HEAD EAST SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH
PRECIPITATION MORE SCATTERED. AGAIN...HIGHEST CHANCES OF RAIN
IN SOUTHEAST HALF OF STATE. LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...IS SOME INDICATION
THAT MCS WILL GET GOING IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND MAY APPROACH
WESTERN ARKANSAS TOWARD MONDAY MORNING.

ON MONDAY...WHATEVER IS LEFT OF THE MCS WILL SLIDE FROM WESTERN
INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. IN NORTHERN/EASTERN SECTIONS...MOSTLY
DRY WEATHER EXPECTED WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FROM THE
NORTH. FRONT IN THE STATE ON SUNDAY WILL SAG BACK TO THE SOUTH
IN RESPONSE TO THE HIGH.

SMALL CHANCES OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS MENTIONED ON TUESDAY IN
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS NEAR THE FRONT. MOSTLY DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL SECTIONS.

TEMPERATURES FAIRLY TRICKY...BUT WITH LOTS OF CLOUDS/CHANCES
FOR PRECIPITATION IN MUCH OF THE SHORT TERM...PRETTY GOOD BET THAT
READINGS WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL...ESPECIALLY DURING THE DAYTIME.
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
LATEST GFS SOLUTION TAKES SFC BOUNDARY S OF AR BY MIDWEEK AS CENTER
OF HIGH PRES PASSES N OF THE STATE. HAVE FOLLOWED TRENDS OF GOING
FCST AND LEFT SMALL POPS IN FOR THAT TIMEFRAME WITH BNDRY STILL IN
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AR. MOISTURE IS FCST TO RETURN IN EARNEST LATE IN
THE WEEK AS SFC HIGH SHIFTS EWD AND ANOTHER UPPER SYSTEM IS PROGGED
TO AFFECT THE FA. LEFT POPS IN CHC CAT FOR NOW AND WAIT TO SEE MORE
CONSISTENCY IN LATER MODEL RUNS. NO SIG CHGS MADE TO TEMPS THRU THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
355 AM CDT SAT JUN 26 2004

.SHORT TERM...
FRONT DROPPING SLOWLY SOUTHWARD THROUGH ARKANSAS THIS MORNING...
AND WILL EVENTUALLY SETUP IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE STATE.
SLIGHTLY COOLER/DRIER AIR NORTH OF FRONT...WITH MUGGY
CONDITIONS/LOTS OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FARTHER SOUTH. AREAS
OF FOG FORMING IN CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS DURING THE PREDAWN
HOURS...AND WILL MENTION EARLY IN THE FORECAST.

AROUND FRONT...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
WILL POP UP TODAY. THIS WILL MAINLY BE NOTED IN THE SOUTHERN
COUNTIES. LITTLE TO NO PRECIPITATION MENTIONED NORTH OF
LITTLE ROCK.

FORECAST FAIRLY STRAIGHT FORWARD IN THE FIRST TWELVE HOURS...
THEN IT BECOMES RATHER COMPLEX. FRONT WILL BEGIN SLOWLY
HEADING BACK TO THE NORTH TONIGHT/SUNDAY. DEEP TROUGH OF
LOW PRESSURE IN TEXAS WILL MEANDER TO THE NORTHEAST. MEANWHILE...
ARKANSAS WILL BE CLOSE TO THE EXIT REGION OF A JET TO THE NORTH.
IT ALL ADDS UP TO A LOT OF LIFTING MECHANISMS...AND HEFTY CHANCES
OF RAIN.

FOR TONIGHT...HAVE SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY SOUTH OF LITTLE
ROCK. LIKELY CHANCES SHIFT NORTH/EAST SUNDAY MORNING...WITH ROUGHLY
SOUTHEAST HALF OF THE STATE AFFECTED. GFS INSISTS ON WIDESPREAD 2
INCH PLUS RAINFALL AMOUNTS TONIGHT/SUNDAY. WHILE THIS IS LIKELY
OVERDONE...DID MENTION POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY RAIN CENTRAL/SOUTH
DURING THIS TIME FRAME. WILL LET DAY CREW EVALUATE SITUATION...
WITH FLASH FLOOD WATCH NOT OUT OF THE QUESTION.

TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL FLATTEN/HEAD EAST SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH
PRECIPITATION MORE SCATTERED. AGAIN...HIGHEST CHANCES OF RAIN
IN SOUTHEAST HALF OF STATE. LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...IS SOME INDICATION
THAT MCS WILL GET GOING IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND MAY APPROACH
WESTERN ARKANSAS TOWARD MONDAY MORNING.

ON MONDAY...WHATEVER IS LEFT OF THE MCS WILL SLIDE FROM WESTERN
INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. IN NORTHERN/EASTERN SECTIONS...MOSTLY
DRY WEATHER EXPECTED WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FROM THE
NORTH. FRONT IN THE STATE ON SUNDAY WILL SAG BACK TO THE SOUTH
IN RESPONSE TO THE HIGH.

SMALL CHANCES OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS MENTIONED ON TUESDAY IN
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS NEAR THE FRONT. MOSTLY DRY WEATHER WILL CONTINUE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL SECTIONS.

TEMPERATURES FAIRLY TRICKY...BUT WITH LOTS OF CLOUDS/CHANCES
FOR PRECIPITATION IN MUCH OF THE SHORT TERM...PRETTY GOOD BET THAT
READINGS WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL...ESPECIALLY DURING THE DAYTIME.
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
LATEST GFS SOLUTION TAKES SFC BOUNDARY S OF AR BY MIDWEEK AS CENTER
OF HIGH PRES PASSES N OF THE STATE. HAVE FOLLOWED TRENDS OF GOING
FCST AND LEFT SMALL POPS IN FOR THAT TIMEFRAME WITH BNDRY STILL IN
CLOSE PROXIMITY TO AR. MOISTURE IS FCST TO RETURN IN EARNEST LATE IN
THE WEEK AS SFC HIGH SHIFTS EWD AND ANOTHER UPPER SYSTEM IS PROGGED
TO AFFECT THE FA. LEFT POPS IN CHC CAT FOR NOW AND WAIT TO SEE MORE
CONSISTENCY IN LATER MODEL RUNS. NO SIG CHGS MADE TO TEMPS THRU THE
PD.

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE ALL DISSIPATED FROM LOSS OF HEATING. 
FRONTAL SYSTEM STILL SOMEWHERE IN THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE BUT
IT IS DIFFUSE AND BOUNDARIES FROM SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE
MADE LOCATION OF FRONT VERY TOUGH TO LOCATE. DOES NOT LOOK LIKE
THERE WILL BE MUCH IN THE WAY OF PRECIPITATION THE REST OF THE

OF A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE REST OF

AS AIR IN THAT AREA IS A LITTLE DRIER. MIN FORECASTS KEPT ABOUT
THE SAME ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SIGNS THE SOUTH MAY NOT COOL OFF AS MUCH

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
SOME CHALLENGES AHEAD FOR THE SHORT TERM...AS MONOTONOUS PATTERN 
CONTINUES. COLD FRONT SLOWLY PUSHING SOUTHWARD FROM NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS...NOT FAR FROM ITS POSITION AT 10 AM THIS MORNING. SYSTEM 
WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY SAG SOUTHWARD TONIGHT. INTERACTION WITH 
DAYTIME HEATING...AND SHORTWAVE OVER EASTERN ARKANSAS WILL ALLOW 
CHANCE FOR PRECIP FOR NORTHERN/CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS BEFORE 
MIDNIGHT...AND CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AFTER MIDNIGHT. SHOWERS 
WILL BE POSSIBLE...AND TO A LESSER DEGREE THUNDERSTORMS. HAVE THUS 
GONE WITH ISOLATED THUNDER WORDING ALONG WITH COVERAGE OF SHOWERS. 

DUE TO HIGH BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE...AND LIGHT WINDS...COULD VERY 
WELL SEE SOME STRATUS AND FOG SETTING UP TONIGHT...INVOF AND TO THE 
SOUTH OF SURFACE BOUNDARY. THIS SHOULD DISPERSE BY MID MORNING 
SATURDAY. WILL CONTINUE ISOLATED/SCATTERED POPS FOR SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT...AS SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL SLOW DOWN/STALL OUT AND 
UPPER LOW WILL MOVE UP FROM TEXAS. 

BY SUNDAY...UPPER LOW WILL SWING ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. GFS IS 
GENERATING ABOUT ONE TO TWO INCHES OF RAINFALL OVER SOUTHERN/EASTERN 
ARKANSAS AS THE LOW MOVES ACROSS. MODELS SEEM TO BE A BIT OVERDONE 
LATELY WITH REGARDS TO QPF...SO HAVE NOT QUITE GONE AS HIGH FOR 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS. WILL MONITOR THIS CLOSELY THOUGH...BECAUSE SLOW 
STORM MOTION AND 1-2 INCH PRECIPITABLE WATER COULD PRODUCE HEAVY 
RAINFALL IN SOME AREAS. 

BRIEF RESPITE MAY OCCUR MONDAY MORNING...AS UPPER SYSTEM HEADS INTO 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY...AND AREA GETS DRY SLOTTED FROM THE SOUTHWEST. 
HOWEVER...BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...RAIN CHANCES WILL INCREASE AS 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVES DOWN OUT OF THE PLAINS.  

BOTTOM LINE IS THAT THIS IS GOING TO BE A LOW CONFIDENCE TEMPERATURE 
FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM. WHILE GUIDANCE IS IN REASONABLE 
AGREEMENT...CLOUD COVER WILL WREAK HAVOC ESPECIALLY WITH THE MAXIMUM 
TEMPERATURE FORECAST. ALSO...AS FAR AS POPS GO...ETA SEEMS TO BE A 
BIT OVERDONE. HAVE GRAVITATED MORE TOWARD A BLEND OF THE MAV/FWC. 
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
INHERITED FORECAST LOOKED PRETTY GOOD TODAY. RAIN CHANCES THROUGH 
THE WEEK WITH STATIONARY FRONT MEANDERING THROUGH THE CWA. WITH THE 
UNCERTAINTY OF WHERE THE FRONT WILL BE...SLIGHT CHANCES ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH THURSDAY ARE JUSTIFIED. HPC 5 DAY PRECIP SHOWS 
A THREE INCH BULLSEYE OVER THE ARKLATEX AREA. WITH THE TROPICAL 
AIRMASS NOT FAR TO THE SOUTH AND THE STATIONARY FRONT CLOSE 
BY...WILL NEED TO KEEP AN EYE ON RAINFALL AMOUNTS INTO THE MIDDLE OF 
NEXT WEEK.

LATE THURSDAY/EARLY FRIDAY GFS MOVES THE NEXT SHORTWAVE INTO THE 
MIDSOUTH. LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS AHEAD OF IT...AND TRANSLATES ACROSS 
ARKANSAS THROUGH LATE WEEK. WENT AHEAD AND PUT SMALL RAIN CHANCES IN 
THE STATE THROUGH THE WEEK...AND WILL SEE HOW THE FORECAST PANS OUT 
AS TIME PROGRESSES.

TEMPERATURES LOOKED GOOD OVERALL. GFS WAS ON A WARMING TREND INTO 
THE END OF NEXT WEEK. FEEL THAT THIS IS JUSTIFIED...AS THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TOWARDS THE ENDS OF NEXT WEEK WILL BRING A WARM 
FRONT NORTH OF THE STATE...ALLOWING NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES TO 
RETURN BY THURSDAY/FRIDAY.

40 PERCENT IN THE SOUTH. MIN FORECASTS LOOK LIKE THEY COULD BE A LITTLE
LOW IN CENTRAL SECTIONS BASED ON DEW POINTS BUT LEFT THEM AS THEY 
ARE. DID ADJUST DEW POINTS UP A LITTLE AND HAVE MOST AREAS SATURATED

THE NIGHT. WENT WITH 30 PERCENT POPS ACROSS SOUTH CENTRAL ZONES AND
40 PERCENT IN THE SOUTH. MIN FORECASTS LOOK LIKE THEY COULD BE A LITTLE
LOW IN CENTRAL SECTIONS BASED ON DEW POINTS BUT LEFT THEM AS THEY 
ARE. DID ADJUST DEW POINTS UP A LITTLE AND HAVE MOST AREAS SATURATED
BY MORNING. MADE MINOR ADJUSTMENT TO WIND FORECASTS BASED ON 
OBSERVED CONDITIONS.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN TO CONTINUE ACROSS ARKANSAS INTO THE 
WEEKEND. MOIST TROPICAL AIR CONTINUES TO FLOW NORTHWARD INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA. LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN ARKANSAS 
TONIGHT. A NEW COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE STATE LATE TONIGHT AND 
ON FRIDAY. THE FRONT SHOULD STALL OUT IN THE STATE BY LATE FRIDAY. 
HAVE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST TONIGHT 
AND FRIDAY WITH BETTER CHANCES OVER THE SOUTH. WITH FRONTAL SYSTEM 
IN THE AREA AND A CONTINUING SERIES OF WEAK H5 SHORT WAVES AFFECTING 
THE AREA...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN THE 
FORECAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN IN THE 
80S WITH LOWS MOSTLY IN THE 60S. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
THE NEARLY STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS ARKANSAS WILL CONTINUE 
TO MOVE BACK AND FORTH ACROSS THE STATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. A RATHER PROGRESSIVE PATTERN CAN BE 
EXPECTED TO BEGIN SUNDAY NIGHT. ZONAL FLOW WILL ALLOW SHORT WAVES TO 
MOVE ALONG THE FRONT AND TRIGGER THUNDERSTORMS AS THEY MOVE THROUGH. 
INCREASED POPS SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...OTHERWISE ONLY MINOR 
ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE. WITH ABUNDANT CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION... 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. DEPENDING ON HOW THE 
FRONT MOVES (OR DOES NOT MOVE) CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ARKANSAS COULD 
EXPERIENCE SOME SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...
ONCE AGAIN...IT APPEARS THE ETA SOLUTION HAS A BETTER HANDLE ON THE 
OVERALL SITUATION. ETA SEEMS TO HAVE INITIALIZED BETTER OVER THE 
SOUTH THAN THE GFS BASED OFF SATELLITE AND RADAR SIGNATURES. ONCE 
AGAIN NUMEROUS CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK PROBLEMS ARE SEEN ON THE GFS. GFS 
DEVELOPS A SERIES OF CONVECTIVE BOMBS ALONG THE STALLED OUT BOUNDARY 
AND SEEMS COMPLETELY OVERDONE. IN ADDITION...GFS HAS HAD A POOR 
TRACK RECORD OF LATE AND ONCE AGAIN WILL BE TOSSED IN FAVOR OF THE 
ETA SOLUTION.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS FRONTAL BOUNDARY HAS CREEPED 
NORTHWARD OVER THE PAST SEVERAL HOURS AND IS NOW LYING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN SECTION OF THE STATE. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE 
OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS...JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE CWA. MODELS 
SHOWING MORE OF A NORTHERN PUSH TO THIS FEATURE THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. 
WAVE DEVELOPS ON THE FRONT THIS AFTERNOON OVER EASTERN TEXAS AND 
MOVES IT NORTHEAST INTO SOUTHERN ARKANSAS TONIGHT AND EVENTUALLY 
INTO NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI. WILL NEED TO REWORK POPS SOMEWHAT OVER 
THE SOUTH AND INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCES POPS THIS AFTERNOON TO THE 
CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE. WILL HOLD ONTO PATCHY FOG THIS MORNING 
BASED ON CURRENT OBS.

MOVEMENT OF THE WAVE WILL BE SLOW IN OVERALL WEAK FLOW ALOFT. WITH 
TROPICAL MOISTURE IN PLACE...POPS WILL NEED TO BE RAISED OVER THE 
SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST TONIGHT. BIGGEST QUESTION IS HOW FAR NORTH TO 
CARRY POPS. LOW LEVEL JET IN A FAVORABLE POSITION TONIGHT AND EVEN 
THOUGH BEST LIFT IS TO THE SOUTH...WOULD BE REMISS IF SCATTERED POPS 
WERE NOT INTRODUCED AS FAR NORTH AS THE METRO.
 
OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH HIGH 
AMPLITUDE BLOCKING PATTERN FORECASTED BY ALL MODELS. UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING WILL REMAIN OVER THE WESTERN CONUS WITH UNUSUALLY DEEP EARLY 
SUMMER POLAR VORTEX OVER SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA. VORTEX WILL SLOWLY 
SHIFT EAST WITH TIME BUT SHORTWAVE ENERGY EJECTING OUT WILL HELP 
PUSH ANOTHER COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE REGION TONIGHT AND FRIDAY. 
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FEATURE BUT OVERALL DYNAMICS 
AND WEAK AND ONLY LOW SCATTERED POPS ARE WARRANTED. BOUNDARY PRESSES 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AND STALLS OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS/NORTHERN 
LOUISIANA.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPEARS TO JUST WOBBLE AROUND FOR THE WEEKEND AS H5 
RIDGING OVER THE EASTERN GULF COAST PRECLUDES ANY MOVEMENT OF THE 
BOUNDARY. PLENTY OF TROPICAL MOISTURE IN PLACE AND FLOW ALOFT WILL
BRING SEVERAL IMPULSES ACROSS THE AREA FOR A CONTINUED CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MODELS BRING A PARTICULARLY STRONG WAVE 
ACROSS THE BOUNDARY SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MID DAY SUNDAY AND 
PRODUCES SOME IMPRESSIVE QPF. BASED ON THE HIGH QPF FORECASTS FROM 
THE MODELS OF LATE...WILL TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH BUT POTENTIAL 
FOR HEAVY RAIN WILL EXIST IN THIS TIME FRAME.

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW SEASONABLE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
WITH CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION ABOUT. MAV/FWC/ETA NUMBERS ALL WITHIN 
A DEGREE OR TWO OR THREE OF EACH OTHER AND SEEM REASONABLE. A BLEND 
OF THE GUIDANCE WILL BE USED. TEMPERATURES MIGHT NOT GET OUT OF THE 
70S SUNDAY IF PRECIPITATION BEING ADVERTISED BY MODELS COMES TO 
FRUITION.
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...
STRONG HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST DURING EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE IN PLACE. THE COLD FRONT WILL 
HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING MUCH PROGRESS IN ANY DIRECTION DUE TO THE 
STRONG RIDGE. AT THIS TIME...THE FRONT SHOULD STAY ACROSS SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS OR EVEN SLIGHTLY FURTHER SOUTH. SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL 
DISTURBANCES WILL MOVE ALONG THE FRONT FOR CONTINUING CHANCES OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN WILL REMAIN A CONCERN. 
OVERALL...ONLY MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE EXTENDED FORECAST...WITH 
TEMPERATURES REMAINING SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL DUE TO THE UNSETTLED 
WEATHER.

FRONTAL SYSTEM REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY IN THE SOUTH. SOME SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA. DUE TO THE
PROXIMITY OF ONGOING SHOWERS...DECIDED TO PUT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS

POINTS IN THE 50S REMAIN IN THE NORTH AND UPDTAED DEW POINT GRIDS TO
ACCOUNT FOR THIS. TEMPS AT 9 PM IN THE NORTH ALONG WITH THESE DEW

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
STATIONARY FRONT REMAINS NEAR AR/LA BORDER THIS AFTERNOON...WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE TRYING TO PUSH INTO THE STATE. HIGH CLOUDS COVER THE 
SE HALF OF THE STATE...WITH A CU FIELD UNDERNEATH ACROSS MOST OF THE 
STATE. EXPECT FRONT TO SAG SOUTH A BIT...OUT OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...WHICH WILL END RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE SOUTH THIS EVENING. 

ONCE THE SUN SETS...EXPECT SKIES TO CLEAR OUT ACROSS NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS...WHILE HIGH CLOUDS REMAIN OVER THE SOUTH. EXPECT STRATUS 
DECK IN THE SOUTH AND SCATTERED STRATUS CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE 
STATE EARLY THURSDAY.

MODELS DEVELOP A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE FRONT EARLY 
THURSDAY...AND CARRY IT THROUGH NORTHERN MS AND INTO TN. TRACK LOOKS 
GOOD WITH ETA/NGM/GFS IN AGREEMENT. THREW SLIGHT CHANCES FOR PRECIP 
IN THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT WITH THE 
SYSTEM...AND KEPT MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES CONFINED TO THAT AREA.

ANOTHER COLD FRONT DROPS OUT OF THE PLAINS FRIDAY. ETA LOOKS TO HAVE 
A BETTER HANDLE ON THE SITUATION. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF IT...BEGINNING LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON IN 
THE NORTH. HOW FAR THE FRONT WILL MAKE IT INTO THE STATE IS 
DEFINETLY A QUESTION AT THIS TIME...AND WILL CAUSE MORE UNCERTAINTY 
IN SATURDAYS FORECAST. PUT BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN FRIDAY 
EVENING/EARLY NIGHT ACROSS CENTRAL AR...AND CONTINUED CHANCES ON 
SATURDAY. 
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
THINGS LOOKING AWFULLY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAYS MODEL SOLUTIONS IN THE 
EXTENDED RANGE. FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPEARS TO WOBBLE AROUND FOR 
SEVERAL DAYS...AS H5 RIDGING OVER THE EASTERN GULF COAST PRECLUDES 
ANY FORWARD PROGRESSION OF THE SYSTEM. WITH THE GULF OPEN 
UP...PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL BE IN PLACE. FLOW ALOFT WILL BE 
SOUTHWESTERLY...AND WILL BRING SEVERAL IMPULSES ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. ALL THIS WILL INTERACT WITH DAYTIME HEATING AND ANY OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES LEFT OVER...ALLOWING FOR A CONTINUED CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS. 

BOTTOM LINE...UNSETTLED WEATHER WILL DOMINATE IN DAYS 4 THROUGH 7. 
IF THE AFOREMENTIONED SCENARIO PANS OUT...CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS MAY SEE SOME SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS. THIS FAR 
OUT...IT IS STILL A BIT EARLY TO SAY FOR SURE...GIVEN THE TIMING 
UNCERTAINTY. THE SITUATION WILL BE MONITORED CLOSELY.

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...
SOME RATHER LARGE DIFFERENCES IN THE MODELS ARE NOTED THIS MORNING 
ACROSS THE REGION. WHILE THE SHORT TERM MODELS ALL DEPICT THE SAME 
OVERALL FLOW AND THE PLACEMENT OF THE SURFACE BOUNDARY...THERE ARE 
SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE LOCATION AND STRENGTH OF A 
SURFACE LOW AND THE ASSOCIATED QPF. GFS DEPICTING A LOW OVER 
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS THAT MOVES NORTHEAST THROUGH MORNING WITH HIGH 
QPF. ETA ONLY HINTS AT A SURFACE LOW AND HAS IT FURTHER NORTHEAST 
AND CONSIDERABLY WEAKER WITH SIGNIFICANTLY LESS QPF.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES WEAK LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. AREA RADARS CONTINUE TO SHOW ONLY ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE SOUTH. GFS SOLUTION WILL BE DISCARDED AS 
THE ETA SOLUTION SEEMS MUCH MORE REALISTIC.

IN ADDITION TO THE AFOREMENTIONED SURFACE LOW...LATEST ANALYSIS 
PLACES A COLD FRONT ROUGHLY FROM A WEST MEMPHIS TO BRINKLEY TO 
FORDYCE TO MAGNOLIA LINE. SKIES HAVE CLEARED OUT RAPIDLY AFTER FROPA 
ACROSS THE NORTH AND WEST WITH FOG/STRATUS NOW PREDOMINATING. WILL 
NEED TO ADD FOG TO THE ZONES/GRIDS THIS MORNING BUT IT DOES NOT 
APPEAR TO BE DENSE ENOUGH TO WARRANT ANY HIGHLIGHTS. MODELS DO SHOW 
THE FRONT SLOWING DOWN SO SOME MORNING POPS ARE NEEDED OVER THE 
SOUTH. FRONT SHOULD CLEAR THE STATE BY MIDDAY...WITH DRY CONDITIONS 
AREA WIDE THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR BUILDING 
DOWN FROM THE NORTH.

FRONT REMAINS STALLED OUT ACROSS CENTRAL LOUISIANA THROUGH THURSDAY 
WITH SOME DEEPER MOISTURE CREEPING BACK INTO THE EXTREME SOUTHEAST 
AS A SHORT WAVE MOVES ALONG IT. WILL NEED TO CARRY AT LEAST SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS HERE THURSDAY AS RETURNS FLOW STARTS TO GET 
REESTABLISHED. WILL LEAVE THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA DRY FOR NOW.

OVERALL PATTERN REALLY DOES NOT CHANGE MUCH THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
DEEP LOW PRESSURE IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC...A BLOCKING RIDGE ALONG 
THE WEST COAST AND AN RATHER IMPRESSIVE...BY JUNE STANDARDS...POLAR 
VORTEX ACROSS MANITOBA AND ONTARIO PROVINCES. NEXT POLAR FRONT DROPS 
DOWN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. FRONT DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE OVERLY 
DYNAMIC AT THIS POINT WITH LITTLE SURFACE CONVERGENCE AND LIFT 
NOTED. ONLY SCATTERED POPS SEEM WARRANTED AT THIS POINT AND CURRENT 
FORECAST HAS IT COVERED. FRONT PASSES THROUGH THE STATE FRIDAY BUT 
STALLS OUT ACROSS NORTHERN LOUISIANA. FRONT JUST SORT OF WAFFLES 
AROUND FOR SATURDAY WITH SHORT WAVE RIPPLING ALONG IT FOR A 
CONTINUING CHANCE POPS. MODELS NOW PICKING UP IN A NEW WAVE WHICH 
SWINGS INTO NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA BY LATE SATURDAY. WILL NEED TO KEEP 
POPS IN THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS FEATURE.

FWC NUMBERS SEEM TOO WARM...ESPECIALLY WITH MORNING FOG/STRATUS... 
WHILE MAV GUIDANCE IS A LITTLE TOO COOL. WILL SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE 
TODAY AND THROUGH OUT THE PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL AVERAGE BELOW

SECTIONS FOR TONIGHT WITH HIGHER CHANCES AS YOU PROGRESS 
SOUTHEASTWARD. POPS WILL CONTINUE TO DECREASE ON WEDNESDAY AS FRONT 
MOVES SOUTHEASTWARD OUT OF THE STATE. HOWEVER...FRONT WILL STALL

.SHORT TERM...TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...
MODELS ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT IN THE SHORT TERM AS FAR AS THE 
SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURES GO. DIFFERENCES CONTINUE TO EXIST IN THE 
DETAILS...ESPECIALLY WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE APPROACHING WAVE FOR 
THE TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME. WHILE BOTH THE GFS AND ETA 
DEVELOP LOW PRESSURE ALONG A COLD FRONT...GFS CONTINUES TO 
EXPERIENCE SIGNIFICANT FEEDBACK PROBLEMS AND GENERATES WAY TOO MUCH 
QPF. GFS SOLUTION WILL NEED TO BE DISCARDED THIS MORNING IN FAVOR OF 
AN ETA/MESO-ETA COMPROMISE.

MODELS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A VERY UNUSUAL LOOKING PATTERN FOR MID 
JUNE WITH STRONG RIDGING OVER THE WEST COAST AND AN INTENSE POLAR 
VORTEX OVER CENTRAL CANADA. OVERALL PATTERN DOES NOT REALLY CHANGE 
TOO MUCH OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS WITH THE RIDGE REMAINING IN PLACE 
BUT THE POLAR VORTEX ONLY MOVES FROM CENTRAL MANITOBA TO HUDSON BAY. 
MAIN PLAYER FOR THE AREA WILL BE A SURFACE LOW MOVING ACROSS THE 
EASTERN GREAT LAKES. WHILE LOW WILL RACE OFF TO THE NORTHEAST...THE 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY THROUGH THE STATE AND LIKELY 
STALL OUT FOR A TIME OVER THE CENTRAL PART OF THE STATE. LATEST 
SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES FRONT OVER THE EXTREME NORTHWEST CORNER OF 
THE STATE. FRONT FORECAST TO SLOWLY SINK SOUTHEAST AND BISECT THE 
STATE FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST BY THE END OF THE DAY. 

TRIO OF CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES THIS MORNING LINE UP FROM CENTRAL 
OKLAHOMA TO SOUTHERN TEXAS. AM EXPECTING THESE TO DECAY AS THEY 
TRACK EAST BUT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS STILL LIKELY AS REMAINS OF 
THESE COMPLEXES SWING THROUGH. ATTENTION WILL THEN TURN TO THE 
AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT. EXPECTING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO 
REDEVELOP IN ITS VICINITY OVER THE WEST DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
TRANSLATE EASTWARD. EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER MAY KEEP TEMPS IN CHECK 
BUT AIRMASS REMAINS TROPICAL IN NATURE AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE. 
WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE A FEW SEVERE STORMS WITH LARGE HAIL 
THE PRIMARY THREAT. LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS ON THE FRONT OVERNIGHT FOR 
ADDITIONAL LIFT AND ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

PRIMARY CONCERN TONIGHT WILL BE HEAVY RAIN WITH PWAT VALUES BETWEEN 
1.5 AND 2.0 INCHES. MODELS ALSO HINTING AT POSSIBLE MCS DEVELOPMENT 
OVER SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE NOT TERRIBLY OMINOUS 
BUT LOCALIZED FLOODING IS STILL A POSSIBILITY. NO HIGHLIGHTS NEEDED 
NOW BUT IF APPROACHING COMPLEXES DROP CONSIDERABLE RAIN TODAY... 
SITUATION MAY NEED TO BE REEVALUATED. 

LOW WILL TRACK TO THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH 
MODELS CONTINUING TO SHOW SIGNIFICANT QPF OUTPUTS. WILL NEED TO 
TOTALLY REVAMP POPS AND QPF FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS 
SYSTEM SLOWLY SINKS TO THE SOUTH ON WEDNESDAY. MAY HAVE TO KEEP 
LIKELY POPS THROUGH MOST OF TUESDAY NIGHT AND SLOWLY TAPER OFF FROM 
THE NORTHWEST WEDNESDAY AS DRIER AIR TRIES TO ADVECT IN. AREA DRIES 
OUT THURSDAY AS WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE IN CONTROL. RESPITE FROM 
THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE BRIEF AS NEW FRONT BEGINS TO DROP DOWN 
FROM THE NORTH ON FRIDAY.

TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION. MAV NUMBERS GENERALLY 
COOLER THAN THE FWC AND LOOK REASONABLE.
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...
VERY FEW CHANGES MADE TO LONG TERM GRIDS. FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE FEATURE IN WEATHER SATURDAY...BUT LOWERED POPS SOME 
DUE TO FASTER MOVEMENT NOW SHOWN BY THE LATEST RUN. LATEST GFS IS 
SHOWING DRY PERIOD FROM SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...BUT DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY...WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS IN FORECAST. FRONT LOOKS TO 
MOVE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT...SO HAVE ADDED SLIGHT CHANCES TO THE 
FORECAST. DID NOT GO WITH A DRASTIC CHANGE AS THE SOLUTION WILL 
CHANGE MANY TIMES BETWEEN NOW AND THEN.

.SHORT TERM...MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
ALL SHORT RANGE MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT THIS MORNING REGARDING 
THE TIMING OF THE FEATURES OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. DIFFERENCES..IN 
SOME CASES SIGNIFICANT ONES...EXIST IN THE INTENSITY OF THESE SAME 
FEATURES. MESO-ETA AND GFS ARE THE STRONGEST SOLUTIONS WHILE THE ETA 
IS THE WEAKEST. ETA HOWEVER HAS BEEN TRENDING SLIGHTLY STRONGER OVER 
THE LAST RUN OR TWO SO IT MAY BE STARTING TO BUY INTO THE STRONGER 
SOLUTION. THAT BEING SAID...WILL GO WITH A MESO-ETA/GFS SOLUTION 
THIS MORNING. 

ATYPICAL PATTERN FOR SUMMER WILL CONTINUE FOR THE SHORT TERM WITH 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE WEST COAST AND AN UNUSUALLY DEEP VORTEX 
FOR MID JUNE OVER THE PRAIRIE PROVINCES OF CENTRAL CANADA. VORTEX 
FORECAST TO SLIDE SOUTH AND DEEPEN. SURFACE LOW MOVING ACROSS 
SOUTHERN CANADA EVENTUALLY DRIVES A COLD FRONT INTO THE CWA 
SOMEWHERE IN THE MONDAY NIGHT TO TUESDAY TIME FRAME. 

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A DECAYING FRONT OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PORTION OF THE STATE. EXPECTING THIS FEATURE TO CONTINUE WASHING OUT 
AND WILL BE A NON FACTOR. ANOTHER INTENSE MCS FORECASTED BY THE 
MODELS TO DEVELOP LAST NIGHT PRETTY MUCH ON SCHEDULE ACROSS KANSAS 
AND NORTHERN OKLAHOMA AT THIS TIME. COMPLEX STILL EXPECTED TO WEAKEN 
AS IT APPROACHES BUT MODELS CONSISTENT WITH OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING 
INTO NORTHERN ARKANSAS AROUND MID DAY. AM EXPECTING AFTERNOON 
HEATING TO TRIGGER SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE CWA.

AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT BEGINS TO APPROACH THE STATE MONDAY NIGHT.
SHORTWAVE ALREADY SEEN ON WATER VAPOR VAPOR OVER SOUTHERN IDAHO 
FORECAST TO DROP INTO THE CENTRAL PLANS AND RAPIDLY INTENSIFY AS IT 
MOVES INTO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA. 

SCENARIO COULD LEAD TO MCS DEVELOPMENT WITH COMPLEX THEN TRAVELING 
ALONG THE BOUNDARY ACROSS CENTRAL OKLAHOMA AND ARKANSAS. MODELS SEEM 
TO BE KEYING IN ON WESTERN AND NORTHWEST ARKANSAS BEFORE WEAKENING 
THE SYSTEM JUST A BIT BEFORE IT ARRIVES IN THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF 
THE STATE. WHILE THE GFS IS HAVING FEEDBACK PROBLEMS ONCE AGAIN AND 
IS OVERDOING QPF...POTENTIAL DOES EXIST FOR AN INCH OR TWO OF RAIN 
GIVEN THE TROPICAL NATURE OF THE AIR MASS AND PWAT VALUES CLOSE TO 
TWO INCHES THROUGH OUT THE EVENT. WILL BE RAISING POPS ACROSS THE 
BOARD TO LIKELY OR CATEGORICAL FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING 
ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS IN AN AREA OF ENHANCED LIFT. 
WILL LEAVE CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE SOUTH. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW 
FRONT SLOWING DOWN ONCE IT REACHES THE CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE 
STATE. FRONT WILL EVENTUALLY BE SHUNTED TO THE SOUTH AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE NATIONS MIDSECTION. POPS WILL BE TAPERED 
DOWN FROM NORTH TO SOUTH TUESDAY AFTERNOON WITH FRONT CLEARING THE 
STATE TUESDAY EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY FOR DRY CONDITIONS. 

CONCERNING TEMPERATURES...FWC NUMBERS SEEM A LITTLE OVER DONE... 
ESPECIALLY FOR TODAY...AND WILL GO MORE IN LINE WITH THE MAV 
GUIDANCE. TODAY WILL BE THE WARMEST DAY IN THIS PERIOD AS CLOUDS AND 
PRECIP WILL KEEP TEMPS IN CHECK TUESDAY. COOLER AIR COMES IN FOR 
WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE FRONT WITH WARMER READINGS FOR THURSDAY AS 
RETURN FLOW GETS REESTABLISHED. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL NEED TO BE 
TWEAKED...MORE SO ON TUESDAY WITH RAIN EXPECTED ACROSS MOST AREAS.

CONTINUING FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST. SHOWED DRYING TREND FOR SATURDAY

MONDAY NIGHT/EARLY TUESDAY...A COLD FRONT WILL ARRIVE FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. NEW DATA SHOWS SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS POPPING UP ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT. WOULD EXPECT 
TO HAVE SOME SEVERE WEATHER...AND AREAS OF HEAVY RAIN GIVEN NEARLY 
TROPICAL AIRMASS.  

LOOKS LIKE FRONT WILL SLOW DOWN AS IT REACHES CENTRAL/SOUTHERN 
ARKANSAS...AND MAY ACTUALLY STALL. GIVEN THIS...HAVE CHANCES FOR 
PRECIPITATION LINGERING INTO WEDNESDAY.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL PUSH FRONT SOUTH OF THE STATE BRIEFLY BEFORE A 
NEW FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST THURSDAY/FRIDAY. THIS WILL 
KEEP THE PATTERN UNSETTLED TO END THE WEEK.

259 PM CDT SUN JUN 20 2004

.SHORT TERM...
RADAR MOSAIC MCS REMNANT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUING 
TO PUSH SOUTHEAST ACROSS EAST AND SOUTHEAST OKLAHOMA. WESTERN 
ARKANSAS WILL BE AFFECTED BY 21Z. ALSO SHOWERS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP 
THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTHERN ARKANSAS AHEAD OF A WEAK WARM FRONT 
MOVING NORTH OUT OF LOUISIANA. 

MODELS AGREE TONIGHT IN TERMS OF DEVELOPING AN MCS AGAIN IN KANSAS 
AND MOVING THROUGH MISSOURI. THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF IT MAY AFFECT 
NORTH ARKANSAS. THEREFORE WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH AND 
SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE SOUTH OVERNIGHT. ANOTHER MCS DEVELOPS MONDAY 
NIGHT AND SHOULD AFFECT ARKANSAS MORE SO THAN TONIGHT. SOME AREAS 
COULD SEE HEAVY RAIN SO WILL HAVE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THIS ONE. LATEST 
CROSS SECTIONS SHOW THE BEST LIFT OCCURRING TUESDAY MORNING. A COLD 
FRONT WILL ALSO BE MOVING INTO ARKANSAS TUESDAY MORNING. WILL TAPER 
THUNDERSTORM CHANCES OFF WEDNESDAY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AS DRIER AIR 
MOVES INTO THE AREA. 
&&

.LONG TERM...
UNUSUALLY ACTIVE EARLY SUMMER PATTERN TO CONTINUE AS THE SUBTROPICAL 
RIDGE REMAINS WEAK AND UNUSUALLY STRONG TROFFING COVERS THE NORTHERN
PART OF THE COUNTRY WITH THE WESTERLIES DISPLACED FARTHER SOUTH THAN
USUAL. SURFACE FLOW RATHER LIGHT THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH WEAK FRONTAL
SYSTEMS LIKELY IN THE AREA ALONG WITH OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM MCS
OR OTHER THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. THIS FAR OUT TOUGH TO PINPOINT 
LOCATION OF FRONTS AND BOUNDARIES AND THIS MAKES WIND FORECAST 
THE MOST DIFFICULT. THE BOUNDARIES WILL FOCUS CHANCES OF RAIN BUT
THIS FAR OUT JUST WENT WITH CHANCE POPS FOR THE MOST PART. 
CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS WILL LIKELY KEEP MINS IN THE MID 60S NORTH
TO LOWER 70S SOUTH AND MAXES IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S NORTH WITH
MID AND UPPER 80S CENTRAL AND SOUTH. GFS YESTERDAY INDICATED RATHER
SIGNIFICANT WAVE ON FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY AND THIS
MORNING IT SHOWED THIS HAPPENING ON SATURDAY. UNDOUBTEDLY THIS 
WILL CHANGE SEVERAL TIMES OVER BEFORE THEN SO DID NOT FORECAST 
CONDITIONS FITTING THESE SCENARIOS TOO CLOSELY.

MCS OVER OKLAHOMA IS MOVING VERY SLOWLY TO THE EAST. LOWERED POPS 
FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING THEN LOWERED THEM SLIGHTLY FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON...KEEPING BEST CHANCE IN THE SOUTH. WILL EXPECT WARM FRONT 
TO MOVE NORTH OUT OF LOUISIANA THIS AFTERNOON AND THE REMAINS OF THE

FRONTAL BOUNDARY IN NORTHERN LOUISIANA THIS MORNING...AND MCS OVER 
KANSAS MOVING EAST SOUTHEAST. THE FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH TODAY AS A 
WARM FRONT...BUT WILL WASH OUT ACROSS ARKANSAS. SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SOUTH TODAY DUE TO THIS FEATURE. ISOLATED 
PRECIP IN THE NORTH AS REMNANTS OF MCS MOVE INTO SOUTHERN 
MISSOURI...AND COMBINES WITH DAYTIME HEATING.

MAIN CONCERN IS WITH TONIGHT...AS ANOTHER IN A SYSTEM OF NIGHTLY 
MCS/S WILL DEVELOP. SOME MODEL DIFFERENCES WITH TIMING OF THIS 
SYSTEM...WITH THE ETA BEING JUST A LITTLE FASTER. MAIN PORTION OF 
MCS WILL STAY TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA...WITH OUTFLOW BOUNDARY/FRONT 
BEING THE FEATURE OF CONCERN IN ARKANSAS. HAVE GONE WITH A BLEND OF 
MODELS IN REGARD TO TIMING OF PRECIPITATION...BEGINNING AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AND INCREASING TOWARD THE AFTERNOON HOURS MONDAY. 
AREA IS IN SLIGHT RISK MONDAY...WITH THE CONCERNS BEING DAMAGING 
WIND AND LARGE HAIL IN THE AFTERNOON AS BOUNDARY INTERACTS WITH 
HEATING OF THE DAY.

ONCE AGAIN...ANOTHER MCS WILL DEVELOP MONDAY NIGHT...THIS TIME IN 
OKLAHOMA...AND MOVE ALONG/NEAR THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IN ARKANSAS. 
HAVE INCREASED POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY TIMEFRAME...AND THESE 
STILL MAY BE TOO CONSERVATIVE. WOULD LIKE TO SEE DEVELOPMENT OF MCS 
TONIGHT AND ASSOCIATED BOUNDARY PLACEMENT BEFORE NUMEROUS SHOWERS 
ARE INTRODUCED.

CONCERN WITH THESE SYSTEM THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS WILL BE WITH 
FLOODING. AS IS THE CASE WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTERACTING WITH 
NUMEROUS SHORTWAVES...RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD BE QUITE HIGH. SOME 
AREAS OF THE WEST RECEIVED OVER 2 INCHES OF RAIN SATURDAY EVENING. 
WILL HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL FOR SLOW MOVING THUNDERSTORMS/FLOODING IN 
THE HWO.

DRIER/COOLER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE STATE WEDNESDAY. HAVE LEFT 
ISOLATED POPS IN THE FORECAST DUE TO TIMING ISSUES...BUT WILL SEE A 
DIFFERENCE IN DEW POINTS. HOWEVER...THIS WILL BE SHORT LIVED...AS 
ANOTHER SYSTEM DEVELOPS IN THE PANHANDLE REGION AND MOVES EAST 
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE FOR THE SHORT TERM. 
CURRENTLY...COMPLEX OF STORMS MOVING INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS...AND 
WIDELY SCATTERD CONVECTION BEGINNING TO FORM SOUTH OF FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO PULSE UP AND DOWN AS THE COMPLEX 
HEADS SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD...WITH SOME STORMS REACHING SEVERE 
LIMITS...AND WIND BEING THE PRIMARY THREAT. SEVERE WINDOW WILL BE 
BRIEF...WITH CHANCES DECREASING RAPIDLY AFTER SUNSET. 

FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL STALL OVER NORTH LOUISIANA TONIGHT...WITH 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER RED RIVER VALLEY AGAIN AS 
ANOTHER IN A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES MOVES TOWARD WESTERN ARKANSAS. 
THUS...MCS POTENTIAL ONCE AGAIN LOOKS GOOD FOR TONIGHT. AS IS 
USUALLY THE CASE WITH THESE SYSTEMS...LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN IS A 
POSSIBILITY WITH SOME STORMS THAT DEVELOP...GIVEN PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES IN THE ONE TO TWO INCH RANGE...AND STORM MOTION AROUND 5 
KNOTS. FOR SUNDAY...RAIN CHANCES WILL INCREASE AGAIN AS REMNANTS OF 
MCS INTERACT WITH HEATING OF THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.

BY SUNDAY NIGHT/EARLY MONDAY...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BEGIN TO BACK 
TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. WITH APPROACHING SHORTWAVE...LOOKS 
LIKE THERE COULD BE ANOTHER MCS MOVING DOWN OUT OF KANSAS/MISSOURI 
AND ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS. WITH HIGH PRESSURE PASSING TO THE 
NORTH...FRONT IS LIKELY TO STALL IN THE VICINITY OF NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS. THERE IS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE STORMS ON MONDAY /DAY 
3/...AS ANOTHER SHORTWAVE INTERACTS WITH THE BOUNDARY AND THE 
HEATING OF THE DAY. 
&&

.LONG TERM...TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
FRONTAL ZONE WILL BE OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS AT MIDWEEK WITH THE CHANCE
OF MCS ACTIVITY ALONG AND TO THE NORTH. GFS INDICATES WAVE ALONG
THE FRONT IN RESPONSE TO A SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE ON THURSDAY. IF
THIS WERE TO VERIFY...WOULD NEED LIKELY POPS...BUT THIS FAR OUT 
THE SCENARIO IS LIKELY TO CHANGE SEVERAL TIMES SO WILL JUST GO
WITH 30 TO 40 PERCENT POPS FOR NOW. THERE ARE INDICATIONS OF DRIER 
WEATHER MOVING IN AFTER THAT AND DID NOT MENTION ANY POPS FOR 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AT THIS TIME. MADE LITTLE CHANGE TO
TEMP FORECASTS BUT DID BUMP UP MAXES A LITTLE FOR WEDNESDAY AS IT
LOOKS LIKE THE AREA WILL BE IN THE WARM HUMID SECTOR THAT DAY.

LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES COLD FRONT ROUGHLY FROM NORTH OF 
DEQUEEN TO NEAR PINE BLUFF. VERY LITTLE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM  
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN NOTED SINCE THIS MORNING /6 AM/ IN OUR FORECAST 
AREA. HOWEVER...FURTHER TO THE WEST...COMPLEX OF STORMS SLOWLY 
INCHING ACROSS CENTRAL INTO EASTERN OKLAHOMA. MODELS INDICATING THAT 
SYSTEM WILL WEAKEN AS IT TRIES TO PUSH EAST...AND FOCUS WILL SHIFT 
MORE TOWARD THE SOUTH AS IT INTERACTS WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND 
DAYTIME HEATING...WHICH WILL BE BETTER OVER THE RED RIVER VALLEY.

WILL BE SENDING OUT AN UPDATE THIS MORNING...MAINLY TO READJUST HIGH 
TEMPERATURES. ABUNDANT LOW CLOUD COVER OVER THE NORTH AND CENTRAL 
ZONES HAS KEPT HEATING AT BAY. THERE HAS BEEN AND WILL BE LESS CLOUD 
COVER IN THE SOUTHERN ZONES...INVOF AND OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT. 
THEREFORE...HAVE LOWERED EXPECTED MAXES TO MID 70S NORTH...MID 80S 
CENTRAL...AND REWORDED TO NEAR 90 SOUTH. GIVEN CURRENT OBSERVATIONAL 
TRENDS...THIS SEEMS THE PRUDENT ROUTE. ALSO...HAVE GONE WITH MOSTLY 
CLOUDY FOR THE WEST AND NORTH...AND PARTLY CLOUDY CENTRAL AND SOUTH. 

HAVE BASICALLY KEPT POPS AS-IS AT THIS POINT...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE 
NORTHEAST...TAPERING UP TO 40 PERCENT IN THE SOUTHWEST.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE LITTLE ROCK AR
155 PM CDT FRI JUN 18 2004

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY
UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN SETTING UP FOR THE SHORT TERM. 
CURRENTLY...SEVERAL OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES THAT WERE LEFT OVER FROM 
CONVECTION LAST NIGHT AND EARLY THIS MORNING ACTING TO PRODUCE 
WIDELY SCATTERED/SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MOSTLY OVER 
THE WESTERN HALF OF ARKANSAS. APPROACHING COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM 
SOUTHERN MISSOURI TO CENTRAL OKLAHOMA WILL ALSO AIDE IN DEVELOPMENT 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH TONIGHT. 

FRONT WILL MAKE ITS WAY INTO CENTRAL ARKANSAS TONIGHT...AND TOWARD 
SOUTHERN ARKANSAS EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. SHORT RANGE MODELS HAVE 
BEEN KEYING IN ON MCS DEVELOPING INVOF THE PANHANDLES AREA TONIGHT...
AND MOVING THE SYSTEM THROUGH CENTRAL OKLAHOMA BEFORE DYING OUT 
SATURDAY MORNING. LOOKS AS THOUGH REMNANTS OF THE SYSTEM WILL MAKE 
IT INTO SOUTHWESTERN ARKANSAS BY LATE SATURDAY MORNING AND INTO 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. INTERACTING WITH THE HEATING OF THE DAY...THIS 
WILL ACT TO TOUCH OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF CONVECTION.

 FRONT IS EXPECTED TO WOBBLE AROUND CENTRAL/SOUTHERN ARKANSAS FOR 
MUCH OF THE SHORT TERM. SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS WILL MOVE 
ACROSS...ALLOWING FOR A CONTINUED CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE PERIOD. THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL BE 
ENHANCED BY INTERACTION WITH DAYTIME HEATING. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED 
TO SEE A FEW ISOLATED STRONG STORMS DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
HOURS. ALSO...WITH SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS OKLAHOMA ON SATURDAY 
NIGHT AND INTERACTING WITH SURFACE BOUNDARY...POTENTIAL MCS COULD 
OCCUR AND SCRAPE SOUTHERN ARKANSAS SUNDAY MORNING. 

WITH PRECIPITABLE WATERS IN THE 1.5 TO 2 INCH RANGE...AND WITH MCS 
POTENTIAL OVER THE SOUTHWEST...SOME STORMS MAY PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL. WILL CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT THIS IN HAZARDOUS WEATHER 
OUTLOOK. 

LOOKS AS THOUGH SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL ATTEMPT TO MOVE BACK TO THE 
NORTH ON MONDAY...BUT WITH MORE UPPER SYSTEMS APPROACHING...RAIN 
CHANCES WILL CONTINUE. 

ONE FINAL CONCERN...AND THIS DEALS WITH POTENTIAL HEAT INDEX 
PROBLEMS. ALTHOUGH HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA IS NOWHERE NEAR BEING 
MET...DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S AND LOWER 70S...AND AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES IN THE 80S TO NEAR 90...COULD PUSH HEAT INDEX VALUES TO 
NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE  100 DEGREES. THE AREA MOST LIKELY AFFECTED 
WOULD BE SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. SUCCEEDING SHIFTS WILL NEED TO MONITOR 
AND PERHAPS HIGHLIGHT THIS IN THE FORECAST IF THE SITUATION 
WARRANTS.  
&&

.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
UNUSUALLY ACTIVE EARLY SUMMER PATTERN TO CONTINUE MOST OF NEXT WEEK 
AS THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE REMAINS WEAK AND 500 MB HEIGHTS IN THE AREA 
REMAIN IN THE MID 580S OR SO. APPEARS FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL BE STALLED 
ACROSS NORTHERN ARKANSAS MONDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AND GFS HINTS 
AT A COUPLE OF MCS MOVING ACROSS THE AREA. ENHANCED POPS TO 40 
PERCENT IN THE NORTH TO REFLECT THIS ALTHOUGH TIMING AND LOCATION 
WILL BE HIGHLY SUBJECT TO CHANGE BY THEN. GENERALLY WENT WITH 30 
PERCENT POPS ELSEWHERE. FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT...AREA MAY BE IN LULL BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE TROPICAL AIR MASS 
WILL STILL BE IN PLACE SO LEFT 20 POPS GOING. THEN ANOTHER COLD 
FRONT MOVES CLOSE TO THE AREA FRIDAY SO PUT IN 30 PERCENT POPS FOR 
THAT. I WAS SO CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME RAIN GOING ON IN 
EACH PERIOD TO USE COVERAGE WORDING IN THE EXTENDED. KEPT MIN TEMP 
FORECASTS AS THEY WERE BUT SHADED MAXES DOWN A CATEGORY OR SO IN 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS TO FIT MEX AND EXTENDED GUIDANCE.

.DISCUSSION...
BROAD RIDGE...ALMOST ZONAL FLOW...IS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN UNITED 
STATES TODAY. LOTS OF GULF MOISTURE STREAMING UP...WITH DEWPOINTS IN 
THE MID 70S IN SOUTHERN ARKANSAS. NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT JUST TO 
THE NORTH OF THE STATE...AND THIS WILL COME INTO PLAY TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. LARGE MCS ACROSS KANSAS AND NORTHEAST OKLAHOMA THIS MORNING 
MOVING NORTHEAST...WITH SOUTHERN EXTENT SHOWING A DECREASING TREND. 
HOWEVER...OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM MAIN AREA OF 
ACTIVITY. THIS WILL COMBINE WITH THE UNSTABLE AIR OVER ARKANSAS AND 
AFOREMENTIONED FRONT TO PRODUCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. SEVERE 
WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF 
INSTABILITY...WITH LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS THE PRIMARY 
CONCERNS.

MODEL DIFFERENCES COME INTO PLAY TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...WITH ANOTHER 
MCS DEVELOPING IN THE TEXAS AND OKLAHOMA PANHANDLES. POSITION OF THE 
COLD FRONT IS THE CONCERN...AS THE GFS HAS THE FRONT STAYING IN 
NORTH ARKANSAS...WHILE THE ETA MOVES IT INTO THE CENTRAL SECTION OF 
THE STATE. THIS WILL AFFECT THE MCS POSITION AND THUS THE HIGHER 
QPFS. FOR NOW...WENT MORE WITH THE ETA SOLUTION...BUT THINK THE 
FRONT WILL STALL SOMEWHERE IN CENTRAL ARKANSAS. THUS...HIGHEST POPS 
AND QPF WILL BE IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS SATURDAY.

FRONT WILL MOVE BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT SUNDAY. WITH 
LEFTOVER BOUNDARIES AND PLENTY OF MOISTURE...LEFT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
IN THE FORECAST. FRONT LOOKS TO STALL ALONG THE ARKANSAS MISSOURI 
BORDER SUNDAY NIGHT...AND WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR RAINFALL ONCE AGAIN. 
HAVE LEFT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY...AS MOISTURE WILL 
BE PLENTIFUL. THE REST OF THE FORECAST LOOK ON TRACK AND ONLY MINOR 
CHANGES WERE MADE.

TEMPERATURES WILL HOVER AROUND 90 DEGREES IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST. NORTHERN ARKANSAS WILL SEE 
READINGS IN THE LOWER 80S SATURDAY AFTER THE FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH...BUT WILL CLIMB AGAIN INTO THE MID TO UPPER 80S FOR THE 
UPCOMING WEEK.

APPEARS THAT HIT AND MISS SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WILL PRETTY MUCH 
END BY MIDNIGHT OR SO. ANYTHING THAT DEVELOPS DURING THE OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD SHOULD BE ISOLATED AT BEST. 

FRONT TO NORTH WILL SLOWLY SAG TOWARD ARKANSAS FRIDAY/SATURDAY. 
UNCLEAR AS TO WHAT FRONT WILL DO...BUT WOULD THINK THAT IF FRONT 
DOES MAKE IT INTO ARKANSAS...IT SHOULD STALL. MEANWHILE...MCS
DEVELOPMENT WILL OCCUR IN PLAINS TONIGHT AND AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT. 
BOUNDARIES FROM DECAYING STORMS WILL LIKELY INTERACT WITH FRONT...
WITH CHANCES FOR SHOWERS/STORMS ACROSS REGION INTO THE WEEKEND. 

WOULD THINK GREATEST CHANCES FOR STORMS WOULD BE ACROSS NORTHERN 
HALF OF ARKANSAS NEAR STALLED FRONT. THIS WOULD BE MAINLY DURING 
AFTERNOON/EVENING HOURS. A FEW STORMS WILL LIKELY BECOME 
SEVERE...WITH LARGE HAIL/DAMAGING WINDS POSSIBLE.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY
TROPICAL UPPER SYSTEM MOVING OUT OF THE AREA WITH UPPER HEIGHTS 
BUILDING ACROSS THE AREA AS RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEAST. THIS
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS RIDGE WEAKENS A LITTLE BY 
SATURDAY. FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL BE HANGING JUST TO THE NORTH. 
COMBINATION OF UPPER HIGH TO THE SOUTHEAST AND FRONTAL ZONE TO 
THE NORTHWEST AND RESULTING MCS ACTIVITY ALONG IT WILL LEAD TO 
COMPLICATED SCENARIO FOR THE CWA IN THE SHORT TERM. THE RIDGE 
LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO HOLD THE FRONT NORTH OF
THE AREA UNTIL AT LEAST SATURDAY NIGHT THEN THE UPPER FLOW BUCKLES 
ENOUGH TO ALLOW THE FRONT TO PENETRATE THE AREA. HOWEVER...THERE 
ARE STRONG SIGNALS OF AN MCS ACROSS KANSAS INTO MISSOURI TONIGHT
INTO EARLY FRIDAY. THIS SHOULD WEAKEN FRIDAY MORNING AND MAY LAY
OUT AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY ON WHICH NEW CONVECTION CAN FORM FRIDAY
AFTERNOON. THERE IS A RISK THIS COULD WANDER INTO NORTHERN 
ARKANSAS LATER FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER MCS IS POSSIBLE
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY AND ALL THESE EFFECTS COULD PUSH THE 
EFFECTIVE BOUNDARY INTO ARKANSAS AND RESULT IN A SCENARIO CLOSE TO 
WHAT THE GFS IS DEPICTING. INDICATIONS ARE RETURN FLOW SHOULD SET
UP BY SUNDAY AS THE SURFACE HIGH MOVES TO THE EAST AND THE FRONT
RE-ESTABLISHES ITSELF TO THE NORTH. DUE TO THE MANY MESOSCALE
VARAIBLES AND UNCERTAINTY WENT WITH A COMPROMISE FORECAST. 
FOR TONIGHT...WENT WITH SMALL POPS ACROSS THE NORTH EARLY DUE TO 
THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF AN MCV MOVING ACROSS THAT AREA AND IN THE 
EAST FROM REMAINING EFFECTS FROM THE TROPICAL SHORT WAVE. WENT
CLOSE TO PERSISTENCE ON MINS. FOR FRIDAY...INCREASED POPS TO 
30 PERCENT ACROSS THE NORTH FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF THUNDERSTORMS 
MOVING INTO THE AREA FROM AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY THEN CONTINUED POPS
INTO FRIDAY NIGHT AND KEPT SMALL POPS IN CENTRAL SECTIONS. 
OTHERWISE HAVE SMALL POPS FOR FRIDAY FOR ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT IN 
WARM HUMID TROPICAL AIR MASS. BROAD BRUSHED 30 PERCENT POPS ACROSS
THE ENTIRE AREA FOR SATURDAY FOR NOW AND BACKED OFF TO 20 PERCENT
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT THEN CONTINUED SMALL POPS FOR ALL DAY SUNDAY. 
WENT WITH MAXES IN THE LOWER 90S IN CENTRAL AND SOUTH FOR FRIDAY
AS CONFIDENCE HIGH THOSE AREAS WILL HEAT UP. WENT LOWER ON MAXES
FOR SATURDAY DUE TO POSSIBLE EFFECTS OF CLOUDS AND MCS ACTIVITY.    
&&

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY
ZONAL FLOW WILL BE PREDOMINANT IN THE UPPER LEVELS DURING THE 
EXTENDED PERIODS. CONSEQUENTLY...ANY SURFACE SYSTEMS THAT ATTEMPT TO 
COME DOWN FROM THE NORTH WILL BE SLOW TO DO SO. WHICH BRINGS TO 
ATTENTION APPROACHING COLD FRONT COMING DOWN FROM MISSOURI. EXTENDED 
RANGE MODELS NOW BRING THE FRONT DOWN TOWARD NORTHERN ARKANSAS BY 
TUESDAY. SYSTEM APPEARS TO WOBBLE AROUND THE AREA FOR SEVERAL DAYS.

DURING THIS TIME...SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS WILL MOVE ACROSS...
AND SOUTHEASTERN RIDGE WILL KEEP THE GULF OPEN FOR BUSINESS. THUS...
THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH WARM AND MOIST AIRMASS AND UPPER 
SUPPORT MOVING ACROSS. 

BY THURSDAY...FLOW ALOFT WILL BECOME MORE SOUTHWESTERLY AS H5 TROUGH 
WILL BUILD OVER WEST TEXAS. THIS WILL PUSH THE DRIFTING BACK TO THE 
NORTH...AND MAY ALLOW A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE JUST BEYOND THE END OF 
THE EXTENDED PERIODS.

UPDATED ZONES TO CLEAR UP MORNING WORDING AND MADE MINOR CHANGES TO
POPS AND WINDS. SOME SHOWERS SHOWING UP IN EAST AND SOUTHEAST AND 
CUT DOWN 30 PERCENT POPS TO THOSE AREAS AND LEFT 20 PERCENT POPS 
ELSEWHERE. MAX FORECASTS LOOKING GOOD BASED ON LATE MORNING TEMPS...
MADE ONE DEGREE INCREASE IN MAXES IN THE NORTH WHICH DID NOT AFFECT
WORDING IN TEXT PRODUCTS. SURFACE RIDGE IN THE AREA HAS RESULTED
IN LIGHT WINDS THIS MORNING SO DECREASED WIND SPEEDS FOR EARLY 
AFTERNOON. UPPER AIR ANALYSIS SHOWED HEIGHTS BUILDING OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. PRETTY MUCH AS PROGGED SO THE RIDGING SHOULD
RESULT IN MORE TYPICAL SUMMER WEATHER FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 
WILL SPEND NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS LOOKING AT NEW MODEL RUNS AND 
DECIDING WHAT THE FRONT MIGHT DO TO THIS AREA OVER THE WEEKEND.
STILL NOT CONVINCED THE FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA AS SOME
OF THE MODELS ARE SHOWING. MAIN DETERMINING FACTOR MAY BE THE
BEHAVIOR OF THE BUILDING UPPER RIDGE IN THE SOUTHEAST.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY
TROPICAL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE INTO WESTERN SECTIONS AND SHEAR OUT THEN
SLOWLY TRANSLATE ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. COVERAGE OF 
PRECIP HAS NOT BEEN AS MUCH AS ANTICIPATED AND WILL LOWER POPS A
LITTLE FOR EARLY TONIGHT...GOING WITH 40 PERCENT AT FIRST THEN LOWERING
TO 30 PERCENT IN MOST AREAS. THIS MAY STILL BE TOO HIGH BASED ON 
COVERAGE LAST NIGHT...BUT WITH TROF AXIS MOVING ACROSS MOIST AIR
MASS HIGHER THAN USUAL POPS LOOK NECESSARY. WENT CLOSE TO 
PERSISTENCE ON MINS AND KEPT ALL AREAS AT OR ABOVE 70. TROF AXIS
IS PROGGED TO BE SLOWER MOVING OUT AND FAIRLY GOOD AMOUNT OF MOISTURE
REMAINS IN THE EASTERN PART OF THE AREA. EXPANDED 30 PERCENT POP AREA
INTO CENTRAL AND SOUTHWESTERN SECTIONS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. FRONTAL
SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT WILL HANG FARTEHR TO THE NORTH AS HEIGHTS RISE 
ACROSS ARKANSAS AND A FAIRLY STRONG UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE AREA
BY FRIDAY. THUS CUT DOWN THE HIGHER POPS FOR THE NORTH. MODELS...
ESPECIALLY THE ETA...INDICATE AN MCS WILL DEVELOP IN THE PLAINS 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND ROLL EAST INTO MISSOURI. IF THIS UNFOLDS WILL
HAVE TO WATCH OUT FOR OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES SNEAKING INTO NORTHERN
SECTIONS ON FRIDAY BUT FOR NOW WILL JUST GO WITH ISOLATED AFTERNOON
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA AND CONTINUE THIS FOR
SATURDAY. MAX TEMPS SHOULD WARM UP WITH MOST AREAS INTO THE LOWER
90S FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. GFS SHOWS RIDGE WEAKENING A LITTLE
OVER THE WEEKEND AND A COLD FRONT MOVING IN BY LATE SATURDAY BUT 
WILL DISCOUNT THIS FOR NOW AT LEAST THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY.      
&&

.LONG TERM...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
EXTENDED RANGE SOLUTIONS NOW PUSHING STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
FURTHER NORTHWARD BY THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD. LOOKS LIKE THE 
AREA WILL BE IN THE WARM SECTOR FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD. 
WITH ZONAL FLOW IN THE UPPER LEVELS FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD...FRONT 
WILL WOBBLE AROUND IN THE VICINITY OF SOUTHERN MISSOURI. SEVERAL 
UPPER SYSTEMS WILL MOVE ACROSS...BUT ANY CONVECTION SHOULD BE MOSTLY 
DIURNAL IN NATURE...AS HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE DOMINANT FOR MUCH OF 
THE PERIOD. STILL HIGHLY DOUBTFUL IF THE FRONT WILL EVEN PASS 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE THE END OF THE PERIOD. WILL AT 
LEAST KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE DIURNAL POPS IN THE FORECAST.

500 MB LOW STILL OVER EASTERN TX THIS MORNING AND SHOULD SHEAR OUT
ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS LATER TODAY BEFORE TRANSLATING EAST TONIGHT.
CONVECTION HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED THIS MORNING AND MANY AREAS HAVE WARMED
UP WELL SO HAD TO RAISE MAXES IN MOST AREAS...ESPECIALLY CENTRAL 
SECTIONS. RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING INTO SOUTHERN AR AT 16Z WILL
LIKELY HOLD TEMPS DOWN IN THAT AREA FOR AWHILE BUT THINK TEMPS WILL
RALLY SOME THERE LATER. DUE TO LACK OF ACTIVITY THIS MORNING LOWERED
POPS TO 50 PERCENT FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND WENT FOR SCATTERED 
COVERAGE. DO THINK SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE DURING THE
AFTERNOON WITH MORE COVERAGE THAN USUAL FOR SUMMER SITUATIONS BUT 
LIKELY POPS LOOK LIKE OVERKILL RIGHT NOW. ACTIVITY SHOULD DECREASE
WITH LOSS OF HEATING BUT WILL LIKELY STAY WITH MORE COVERAGE THAN 
USUAL AS THE TROF AXIS MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. STARTED WITH 50 PERCENT
POPS THEN SLOWLY LOWERED TO 30 PERCENT IN MOST AREAS DURING THE NIGHT
WITH LOWER POPS IN THE WEST TOWARD THURSDAY MORNING. FROM THE LOOKS
OF THINGS WILL NOT SEE MUCH MORE THAN ISOLATED COVERAGE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY UNLESS A MESO BOUNDARY OR TWO SETS UP
IN THE AREA.

H5 LOW WILL BE OPENING AND LIFTING TO THE NORTHEAST THROUGH 12Z 
THURSDAY. THEN...IT WILL BECOME A SHEAR AXIS THAT DISSIPATES BY 12Z 
FRIDAY. UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO TAKE HOLD FROM THEN ON...SO RAIN 
CHANCES FOR THE WEEK END DROP SIGNIFICANTLY. ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES 
POPS WILL BE LEFT IN THE FORECAST TO ACCOUNT FOR PLENTY OF MOISTURE 
AND DAYTIME HEATING. POPS WILL START OUT LIKELY TODAY AND DECREASE 
TO CHANCE TONIGHT. POPS WILL CONTINUE DECREASING THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT. NEXT SIGNIFICANT POPS RETURN FOR THE BEGINNING OF 
NEXT WEEK. ADJUSTED TEMPS UPWARDS FOR THOSE DAYS WHERE CLOUDS AND 
POPS DECREASED.

CURRENT FORECAST IN EXCEPTIONAL SHAPE AND ONLY SUPERFICIAL CHANGES 
WILL BE NEEDED TONIGHT WHICH WILL HAVE NO EFFECT ON THE FORECAST 
PRODUCTS. CURRENT WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS TROPICAL LOOKING UPPER 
LEVEL FEATURE NEAR HOUSTON TEXAS. ALL MODELS CONTINUE TO MOVE THE 
FEATURE SLOWLY NORTH THROUGH THE NIGHT AND EVENTUALLY OPENING IT UP 
INTO A TROF. TROF THEN FORECAST TO MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS THE STATE 
WEDNESDAY. 

WHILE SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS DECREASED SOMEWHAT THIS EVENING...TROPICAL 
MOISTURE REMAINS ABUNDANT WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 70S AND PWAT VALUES 
HOVERING NEAR TWO INCHES. SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ANYTIME TONIGHT 
WITH AXIS OF VORTICITY STRETCHING FROM THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL TO THE 
RED RIVER. WITH NO REAL KICKER SEEN...SCATTERED POPS SEEN RIGHT ON. 
TEMPERATURES AND WINDS ALSO LOOK RIGHT ON TARGET AND WILL BE LEFT 
ALONE.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY
TROPICAL LOWS TO THE SOUTH WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER FOR THE AREA OVER
THE NEXT TWO DAYS. UPPER LOW OVER EASTERN TEXAS WILL SHEAR OUT AND
MOVE EAST ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY WHILE SURFACE LOW
IN MISSISSIPPI IS PROGGED TO WEAKEN AND BECOME A NON-ENTITY. OVERALL
SYSTEM WILL BE WEAKENING BUT VERY MOIST AIR MASS WITH DEW POINTS IN
THE LOWER 70S AND PWS UP TO 2 INCHES WILL COVER THE AREA. LOOKS LIKE
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN WITH THE MOST
NUMEROUS ACTIVITY DURING THE DAY AND LESS AT NIGHT. BASED ON THAT
WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS DURING THE NIGHT WITH 30 TO 40 PERCENT FOR THE
MOST PART AND BROAD BRUSH 60 PERCENT POPS DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY
AS THE TROF AXIS MOVES UP INTO THE AREA. WILL DECREASE POPS FROM THE
WEST LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE TROF AXIS MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. 
FOR THURSDAY...WILL KEEP 30 PERCENT POPS IN THE EAST EARLY AS THE 
SHEAR AXIS AND MOISTURE CONTINUE IN THAT AREA. BY LATE IN THE DAY
THINK MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE DRY BUT WILL KEEP 20 PERCENT POPS IN 
AS RESIDUAL MOISTURE REMAINS AND A BOUNDARY OR TWO MAY BE LYING 
AROUND TO FOCUS SOME ACTIVITY. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE NEAR THE 
NORTHERN BORDER OF THE STATE BUT HEIGHT RISES SHOULD HOLD THE FRONT 
JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA. WILL GO A LITTLE HIGHER ON POPS ACROSS
THE NORTH THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY DUE TO THE NEARNESS OF THE FRONT. 
MAX TEMPS LIKELY WILL BE HELD DOWN BY CLOUDS WEDNESDAY BUT MOST AREAS
SHOULD BREAK OUT THURSDAY WITH MAXES REACHING THE UPPER 80S IN MANY 
AREAS. FRIDAY SHOULD BE WARMER WITH MOST AREAS SOUTH OF THE OZARKS 
REACHING THE LOWER 90S. THE HIGH DEW POINTS SHOULD KEEP MOST MINS IN 
THE 70S WITH ONLY THE NORTH DIPPING INTO THE 60S.     
&&

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
EXTENDED RANGE MODELS NOW PROJECT FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO STALL NEAR 
NORTHERN ARKANSAS/SOUTHERN MISSOURI BY THE LATE WEEK. SHORTWAVE WILL 
MOVE ACROSS ON FRIDAY NIGHT...INTERACTING WITH THE SYSTEM AND GIVING 
A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY FOR NORTHERN ARKANSAS. 

UPPER RIDGE BUILDING UP FROM THE GULF WILL KEEP THE FRONT FROM 
MAKING SIGNFICANT FORWARD PROGRESSION ON SATURDAY...AND THE SYSTEM 
LOOKS TO WOBBLE BACK AND FORTH FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. MOST OF THE 
AREA WILL BE IN THE WARM SECTOR...WITH SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS 
MOVING ACROSS IN THE MEAN FLOW. THUS...THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED 
SLIGHT CHANCE/LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH AT 
LEAST MONDAY NIGHT...WHEN RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHWEST...AND FLOW 
ALOFT BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY...ALLOWING THE FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH.

.DISCUSSION...
UPPER LOW ANALYZED OVER EASTERN TEXAS THIS MORNING WITH SURFACE LOW
NEAR KJAN. AREAS OF RAIN MOVING MOSTLY EAST TO WEST ACROSS THE AREA
WITH THE BIGGEST CONCENTRATION IN THE SOUTH. BASED ON RADAR TRENDS
THIS MORNING UPPED POPS TO LIKELY CATEGORY IN CENTRAL AND EAST FOR
THIS AFTERNOON AND WENT TO 70 PERCENT IN THE SOUTH. UPPED POPS TO
30 PERCENT IN THE NORTHWEST. NORMALLY...OUTFLOW BOUNDARY AND EFFECTS
OF KANSAS MCS OVERNIGHT WOULD BE A CONCERN FOR NORTHWESTERN ARKANSAS
BUT SATELLITE THIS MORNING SHOWED EFFECTS OF TROPICAL LOWS IN THIS 
AREA AND CIRCULATION AROUND IT DISRUPTING THE SOUTHEASTERN EDGES OF
THE DECAYING MCS...SO ANY OUTFLOWS FROM THIS WILL LIKELY WASH OUT
AND NOT BE MUCH OF A FACTOR. SLIGHT CHANGES MADE TO INCREASE CLOUDS
FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. TEMP AND WIND FORECASTS LOOK GOOD
FOR NOW AND ONLY OTHER UPDATES WERE TO TAKE OUT MORNING WORDING.    
FIRST IMPRESSIONS ARE THAT LITTLE SIGNIFICANT CHANGE WILL BE MADE TO
THE SHORT TERM FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY ON THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.
