.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS EVENING. TEMPERATURES AND THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. NO CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
A SIGNIFICANT AIR MASS CHANGE IS IN STORE IN THE SHORT TERM AS A 
STRONG COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE AREA AROUND MIDDAY TOMORROW. 
ANOTHER NIGHT OF UNSEASONABLY MILD TEMPERATURES IS EXPECTED...WITH 
LOWS IN THE MID 30S TO MID 40S. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE FROM 
WEST TO EAST WITH THE ADVECTION OF HIGHER THETA-E AIR AT 850 MB 
BETWEEN 09Z-12Z. NO PRECIP IS EXPECTED AS THE MOISTURE IS VERY 
SHALLOW AND THE LIFT IS WEAK. THIS WINDOW OF MOISTURE IS ONLY OPEN 
FOR A SHORT TIME AS ADVECTION OF COLDER AND DRIER AIR KICKS IN 
BETWEEN 15-18Z. TEMPERATURE GRIDS WILL FEATURE A NON-STANDARD 
DIURNAL CURVE WITH TEMPS WARMING LATE TONIGHT...PEAKING IN THE 
MORNING...THEN FALLING SLIGHTLY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WENT BELOW 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPERATURES. IT WILL ALSO BE BREEZY TOMORROW WITH 
WEST WINDS AT 15-25 MPH AND HIGHER GUSTS. THIS SHOULD STAY JUST 
BELOW WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...BY THE START OF THIS 
PERIOD THE COLD FRONT HAS PASSED AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS 
BUILDING INTO THE REGION.  ALOFT...THE UPPER TROUGH OVERHEAD WITH A 
COUPLE OF WAVES TO MOVE THROUGH THE OVERALL FLOW.  THE FIRST WAVE 
SWINGING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...HAS MOST OF ITS ENERGY TO OUR NORTH.

THE SECOND WAVE MOVING THROUGH ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT WILL PLOW 
DEEP INTO THE CWA...BUT ITS AXIS LOOKS LIKE IT WILL EXIT THE AREA BY 
DAYBREAK TUESDAY.  LIGHT SNOW AMOUNTS ARE POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS WITH FLURRIES IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS.

HOWEVER...THE OVERALL TROFFINESS ALOFT LINGERS...AND ANOTHER WEAKER 
SHORT WAVE RACES THROUGH WEDNESDAY OR WEDNESDAY EVENING...BUT THE 
AIR MASS LOOKS TOO DRY TO OFFER ANY PRECIP.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING STRUGGLES TO BUILD IN FOR A COUPLE OF 
DAYS...THEN AT THE END OF THE PERIOD THE NEXT SYSTEM IS 
APPROACHING.  GFS MOS SEEMS TOO WET IN COMPARISON WITH ENSEMBLES 
AND EURO...SO CUT BACK ON POPS WITH THIS SYSTEM.  ALSO...LOOKS LIKE 
POPS WILL HAPPEN PRIOR TO COOL-DOWN...SO LEAVING WEATHER AS ALL 
LIQUID FOR NOW.

VERY COLD TEMPS ON THE WAY FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEK...WENT 
PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...BRIEF DAY OF HIGH PRESSURE AS WE
FIND OURSELVES BETWEEN THE DEPARTING SYSTEM AND THE NEXT ONE TO
COME SUNDAY. WITH FAIRLY LIGHT WINDS AND LOTS OF SUN TODAY...TEMPS
WILL BE PRETTY MILD WITH MID TO UPPER 50S FOR HIGHS FOR MOST OF THE
VALLEY. FROPA OVERNIGHT TONIGHT MAY BRING MORE SPRINKLES...BUT WILL
LEAVE OUT A MENTION OF RAIN TONIGHT AT THIS TIME.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROUGH MIGRATES EAST TO
THE GREAT LAKES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD WITH DEEP SURFACE LOW
OVER NORTHERN LAKE MICHIGAN AND COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS
MIDDLE TENNESSEE. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW ONLY A NARROW RIBBON OF
70 TO 80 PERCENT MEAN RH IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE FROPA AND ALMOST
NON-EXISTENT POPS. STAYED WITH THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS
WITH THIS VERY LIGHT IF NOT TRACE PRECIP EVENT. THE FRONT MOVES
THROUGH DURING THE MORNING WITH SUNSHINE RETURNING MUCH OF THE AREA
BY AFTERNOON. STRENGTHENING COLD AIR ADVECTION DEVELOPS LATE IN THE
DAY AND THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AS JET ENERGY DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF
THE GREAT LAKES AND ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. DEEPENING MOISTURE WILL
ACCOMPANY THE AMPLIFYING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT
AND MAINTAINED THE HIGHER TERRAIN...SLIGHT THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE
POPS INITIALLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE NORTHERN
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES WITH EXPANSION LATER MONDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT EVERYWHERE BUT SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. STRONG NORTHWEST WINDS SHOULD RESULT IN
OROGRAPHIC SNOWFALL ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN BUT WITH EXTREMELY
COLD AIR ALOFT BUILDING IN ACROSS THE REGION...MUCH OF THE GREAT
VALLEY COULD SEE SNOW FLURRIES BY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND POSSIBLY
LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS MONDAY EVENING. THE UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED
DEEP MOISTURE GRADUALLY LIFT OUT ON TUESDAY BRINGING AN END TO THE
WINTRY PRECIP. STILL DON'T EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL WITH
SOME LIMITATION TO AVAILABLE MOISTURE. THE POSSIBILITY OF ONE OR
TWO INCHES OF SNOW EXISTS FOR SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS FOR
THE DURATION OF THE EVENT.

MODELS INDICATE ANOTHER COUPLE SHORTER WAVELENGTH TROUGHS SWING 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY
BUT MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE LIMITED WITH THESE SYSTEMS SO KEPT A DRY
FORECAST GOING MID WEEK. ANOTHER...MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM
APPROACHES THE AREA ON FRIDAY BUT DOES NOT APPEAR TO IMPACT THE
FORECAST AREA UNTIL SATURDAY.

STAYED CLOSE TO TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE THROUGH MONDAY BUT HAD TO TRIM 
A FEW DEGREES OFF MAX TEMPS AFTER MONDAY WHILE ADDING A DEGREE OR 
TWO TO SUGGESTED MINS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)... A BRIEF WINDOW OF S/SW LOW LEVEL FLOW
WILL HELP PROVIDE A MILD DAY TODAY WITH INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND
SOME AFTERNOON/EVENING SHOWERS OR SPRINKLES. THE CULPRIT...A FAST
MOVING SHORTWAVE THAT WILL CLIP THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES
TODAY/TONIGHT...ACCOMPANIED BY SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AND TRAILING
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. FLOW WILL TEMPORARILY BECOME WESTERLY DURING THE
PRE-DAWN HOURS SATURDAY MORNING BEFORE THE NEXT FAST MOVING FRONT
APPROACHES FOR SUNDAY. SATLT SHOWING LOW CLOUDS ALREADY KNOCKING ON
CHATTANOOGA/S DOOR AS SHALLOW GULF MOISTURE IS CARRIED NORTHWARD
AHEAD OF TODAY/S FRONT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...IT APPEARS WINTER WILL 
BEGIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THIS PORTION OF 
THE FORECAST AS DEEP LONG WAVE TROUGHING FINDS A HOME OVER THE 
EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MODELS WERE 
RELATIVELY CLOSE THROUGH TUESDAY BUT DIVERGE DURING THE LAST COUPLE 
DAYS OF THE LONG TERM. GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE ECMWF THROUGH 
THURSDAY. THE PERIOD STARTS OUT WITH AN EXITING NORTHERN OHIO 
VALLEY/EASTERN LAKES SHORT WAVE. STAYED WITH PREVIOUS THINKING ON 
THIS SYSTEM WHICH ALLOWS FOR A RAPID EXIT AND DRY ADVECTION ACROSS 
THE VIEWING AREA SO NEW YEAR'S EVE SHOULD BE QUIET WEATHER DAY. 
HOWEVER...NEXT SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL BE RAPIDLY 
APPROACHING THE REGION AND BY 12Z SUNDAY THE FRONT WILL BE ON THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THIS SYSTEM WILL NOT HAVE MUCH MOISTURE 
AVAILABLE FOR LIFTING SO KEPT POPS IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY FOR 
RAIN SHOWERS AND APPLIED ONLY ON THE HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES 
INCLUDING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS FOR SUNDAY. TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND ASSOCIATED 
MOISTURE WILL BUILD IN BEHIND THE FRONT ON SUNDAY NIGHT IMPACTING 
MAINLY THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS. MUCH COLDER...ARCTIC AIR WILL STREAM SOUTH ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL LEAD TO THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS. KEPT POPS AT SLIGHT 
CHANCE FOR THIS EVENT. THE CHILLY AIR WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD SOUTH 
OUT OF CANADA MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT AND MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE 
A STRENGTHENING SHORT WAVE TROUGH AND DEEP MOISTURE WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. PLACED SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF OROGRAPHIC SNOW SHOWERS 
WITH THIS FEATURE. COLD AIR WILL CONTINUE TO POUR INTO THE REGION ON 
TUESDAY BUT THE AIR SHOULD BE DRY. THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL 
GRADUALLY DEAMPLIFY SHUTTING DOWN THE ARCTIC CHILL BY WEDNESDAY BUT 
TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. STAYED WITH 
A DRY THURSDAY AS RIDGING BUILDS EAST FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 
CONCERNING TEMPS WENT FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE NEW MEX MOS.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. SON

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
THE FLOW ALOFT BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL TONIGHT AS AN UPPER TROUGH MOVES 
OFF THE EAST COAST. PLENTY OF DRY AIR UPSTREAM SUGGESTS A CLEAR 
NIGHT WITH GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS. HOWEVER A TIGHTENING 
PRESSURE GRADIENT MAY HELP KEEP SOME MIXING GOING...AND THUS HELP 
KEEP TEMPS UP A BIT AND PREVENT MUCH FOG FORMATION. 

A CLOSED LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TOMORROW AND TOMORROW 
NIGHT. THE DEEP SURFACE LOW TO OUR NORTH WILL CREATE A 10-20 MPH SW 
WIND TOMORROW...WHICH SHOULD HELP TEMPERATURES RISE INTO THE MID AND

.DISCUSSION...
00Z OHX SOUNDING FEATURES A VERY DRY LAYER BELOW 700 MB AND A
STRONG INVERSION UP TO 850 MB. EVAPORATIVE COOLING FROM PRECIP
FALLING INTO THE DRY LAYER WILL BE OFFSET BY STRENGTHENING WARM
ADVECTION TO MAINTAIN THE INVERSION OVERNIGHT. ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE
NEEDED TO TEMPERATURE GRIDS TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. 

POP/WX GRIDS LOOK GOOD AS PRECIP IS ON OUR DOORSTEP...THOUGH SOME
MAY EVAPORATE BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND. DEEP LIFT REALLY BEGINS
TO STRENGTHEN AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND CATEGORICAL POPS WILL BEGIN
AROUND THAT TIME.

SO FAR WINDS HAVE BEEN UNDER 20 KTS IN THE MOUNTAINS...BUT AS SEEN

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREAS OF DENSE FOG REMAINS
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE ALONG AND
SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40. HAVE EXPANDED ADVISORY TO COVER THE ENTIRE
VALLEY UNTIL 13Z. DRIER AIR OVER THE PLATEAU WILL EVENTUALLY ERODE
THE FOG...SO VISIBILITIES SHOULD IMPROVE TOWARD SUNRISE.

FOR TODAY...RIDGING SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL KEEP CONDITIONS
DRY...BUT A GOOD DEAL OF HIGH CLOUDS ANTICIPATED.

FOR TONIGHT...UPPER TROUGH ACROS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL APPROACH
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS BECOMING SOUTHERLY
AND INCREASING TOWARD DAYBREAK TUESDAY. THE INCREASING SOUTHERLY
WINDS WILL PRODUCE MODERATE TO STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT. ALSO
INCREASING DIVERGENCE ALOFT AND QG FORCING TOWARD DAYBREAK WILL
PRODUCE WIDESPREAD RAIN SPREADING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST.

SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL BE AT OR CLOSE TO FREEZING OVER THE FAR
NORTHEAST SO A CHANCE OF FREEZING RAIN (POSSIBLY ICE PELLETS)
POSSIBLE...BUT NO ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

GENERALLY WENT A DEGREE TO TWO COOLER THAN GFS MOS GUIDANCE DUE TO
PERFORMANCE THE PAST COUPLE DAYS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SYSTEM PULLS OUT BY LATE 
TUESDAY WITH COLDER AIR WRAPPING IN BEHIND DEPARTING SYSTEM. PRECIP 
MAY BRIEFLY END AS LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS TUESDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY 
OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. A SERIES OF WEAK NORTHERN STREAM SHORT 
WAVES TRANSLATE ACROSS THE NORTHERN CONUS THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 
THE WORK WEEK...BUT IMPACT EXPECTED TO BE MINIMAL ON THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. MODEL AGREEMENT DETERIORATES BY LATE IN THE LONG 
TERM. MADE ONLY A FEW MINOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST FOR 
THAT TIME FRAME. FOR TEMPS... GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CLOUDS DECREASING STEADILY FROM 
THE NW THIS AFTERNOON WITH TEMPS POSSIBLY WARMING FOR THE NEXT 1 1/2 
HOURS OR SO...AND MAYBE GETTING WITHIN A COUPLE OF DEGREES OF 
FORECASTED HIGHS. SURFACE HIGH BUILDS ACROSS SRN OHIO VALLEY 
OVERNIGHT TO CREATE LIGHT WINDS UNDER CLEARING SKIES. CURRENT DEW 
POINT TEMPS WERE RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE MOS GUIDANCE...BUT 
SHOULD FALL OVERNIGHT. 850 MB TEMPS HOLD STEADY OR RISE SLIGHTLY SO 
WON'T FORECAST MUCH OF A MIN TEMP RANGE FOR THE MTN GROUPS. BOUNDARY 
LAYER MAY BE JUST MOIST ENOUGH FOR PATCHY FOG MAINLY NEAR/ALONG AREA 
LAKES. GFS MOS MINS LOOKED QUITE REASONABLE PROVIDED DEW POINT TEMPS 
FALL AFTER SUNSET. 

FOR MONDAY...12Z MODELS ONCE AGAIN SUGGEST NO SHOWERS UNTIL AFTER 
27/00Z...SO I OPTED TO DROP OUR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SE TN MONDAY 
AFTERNOON. CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AND THERE IS LESS ESE 
DOWNSLOPE FLOW INDICATED FOR THE NRN/CENTRAL VALLEY...SO I BLENDED 
MAX TEMPS WHERE ANY SLIGHT MOS DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WET BEGINNING OF THE 
EXTENDED AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS ACROSS THE REGION.  THIS 
WILL BEGIN WIDESPREAD SHOWERS INTO THE AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY.  A FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER INTO TUESDAY NIGHT...AND WITH 
COOLER AIR MOVING IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM...RAIN MAY MIX WITH OR CHANGE 
TO LIGHT SNOW OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH THE SYSTEM EXITING THE 
AREA.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  
MODEL CONSISTENCY POOR BY THE END OF THE PERIOD AND CONFIDENCE 
LESSENS...BUT COULD SEE A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIDE THROUGH AROUND 
FRIDAY TO SATURDAY.  BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT APPEAR TO STAY NORTH AND 
WILL KEEP SOME 20 POPS FOR THIS PERIOD.  BIGGER QUESTION ON SUNDAY 
BUT WILL KEEP THINGS DRY FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW THE RIGHT REAR QUAD OF UPPER 
LEVEL JET IS JUST TO OUR NORTH...BUT MOST FORCING IS ISENTROPIC THIS 
MORNING. LOOKING AT 850-700 MB UPPER AIR PLOTS AND LATEST NAM MODEL 
INDICATES BEST ISENTROPIC LIFT IS OCCURRING ACROSS THE SRN 3/4THS OF 
AL AND GA...WITH JUST SOME VERY WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT INTO THE TN 
VALLEY. THIS LIFT IS GONE BY 21Z...SO I THINK MAINLY A SPRINKLE OR 
TRACE EVENT FOR SE TN AND SW NC THIS AFTERNOON. CURRENT POPS LOOK 
FINE. 

CLOUD COVER (LOWERING TO A MID DECK) IS THICK EVEN OVER SW VA AND NE 
TN...SO I MAY INCREASE CLOUDS JUST A BIT IN MY MORNING UPDATE OF 
GRIDS. WILL ALSO MONITOR THE SLOW RISING TEMPS TO SEE IF MAX TEMP 
FORECAST NEEDS TO BE LOWERED ANY. 

OTHERWISE...PATCHY FOG AND LOW CLOUDS HAVE LIFTED.

CLOUDS TO ALLOW STEAM/RADIATIONAL FOG TO FORM. HAVE INCLUDED AREAS
OF FOG NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS EARLY THIS MORNING.

A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES
WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT PRODUCING A CHANCE OF RAIN OVER THE SOUTHERN
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA TODAY. SYSTEM EXITS
THE AREA QUICKLY BY LATE AFTERNOON WITH SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGING
PRODUCING MOSTLY CLEAR SKY TONIGHT.

GFS MOS CONTINUES TO BE A DEGREE OR TWO TOO WARM...SO WENT A CAT
COOLER MOST LOCATIONS FOR TODAYS HIGH.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES ARE IN 
REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH NEXT IN A SERIES OF SYSTEMS WHICH 
APPROACHES IN THE MONDAY NIGHT TO TUESDAY TIME FRAME. APPEARS TEMPS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN FEATURE FOR TONIGHT
WILL BE VARYING AMOUNTS OF HIGH CLOUDS...AHEAD OF THE SW U.S. UPPER
LOW. EXPECT CLOUDS TO BE THINNER OVER SW VA AND NE TN...SO WENT
CLOSER TO COOLER MOS MINS THERE. CLOUDS SHOULD SLIGHTLY AFFECT MINS
OVER SRN AREAS...WHICH FAVORS WARMER NAM MOS MINS.

GULF COAST SYSTEM SHOULD MAINLY BRING SOME SHOWERS TO GULF COAST
STATES...BUT I SAW NO REASON NOT TO KEEP OUR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ON
CHRISTMAS DAY FOR SE TN AND SW NC. DECREASING CLOUDS SUNDAY NIGHT
WITH MIN TEMPS VERY NEAR SEASONAL NORMALS. MOS TEMPS CLOSE FOR
THESE 2 PERIODS AND I GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO GFS NUMBERS.

FOR MONDAY...MODEL TREND IS TO SLOW DOWN SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE SW
UPPER LOW...BUT I KEPT OUR LOW POPS IN FOR SE TN AND SW NC IN THE
AFTERNOON FOR NOW. LOW LEVEL FLOW SETS UP FOR ESE DOWNSLOPE INTO
NRN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS...SO IF CLOUDS ARE NOT TOO THICK...
THEN HIGHS MIGHT EXCEED MOS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON IN THOSE AREAS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODEL FORECASTS CLOSE 
IN DEPICTION OF FIRST SYSTEM WHICH BUILDS NORTHEAST FROM THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS MONDAY AND ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS BY TUESDAY NIGHT. 
SHOULD BE ANOTHER WARM SYSTEM WITH DECENT RAINFALL AMOUNTS. PRECIP 
BASICALLY COMPLETED PRIOR TO STRONGEST COLD AIR ADVECTION SO NO SNOW 
EXPECTED. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE 
PERIOD SO TOOK A BLEND OF THE ECMWF AND GFS WHICH ALLOWS FOR A LOW 
AMPLITUDE UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE ABOUT WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY TIMEFRAME. 
THIS SYSTEM APPEARS HARMLESS AT THE MOMENT AND MAINTAINED A DRY 
FORECAST MID WEEK UNTIL THE APPROACH OF A STRENGTHENING UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH WHICH IMPACTS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AROUND THE LATE 
FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY TIME PERIOD. ONCE AGAIN TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
RELATIVELY MILD STAYING SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL SO STAYED WITH 
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...PESKY LOW CLOUD LAYER HAS REALLY THINNED OUT THIS 
MORNING PER 12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS...ALTHO STILL A PATCH OR TWO OF 
BROKEN TO OVERCAST AROUND 2000 FEET. ON TOP OF THESE PATCHY LOW 
CLOUDS...JET STREAM CIRRUS CLOUDS ARE NOW PASSING THROUGH. THIS 
SHOULD MEAN NO WORSE THAN PARTLY SUNNY FOR THIS AFTERNOON...AND WE 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO REACH FORECASTED HIGHS IN THE 40S TO MID 50S. 

THESE HIGH CLOUDS MAY BE A FACTOR FOR MINS TONIGHT...AND I DID NOTE 
THAT MOS ENDED UP VERY MUCH ON THE COOL SIDE THIS MORNING...DUE TO 
THOSE PERSISTENT LOW CLOUDS. NICE TO SEE THAT MODELS ARE FINALLY 
HANDLING THE SRN STREAM/GULF COAST LOW MUCH BETTER...KEEPING ANY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE REMAINS
TRAPPED UNDER LOW-LEVEL INVERSION KEEPING MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA
CLOUDY. MODELS SHOW DRIER AIR MOVING INTO THE REGION THIS MORNING.
THE DRY AIR ALONG WITH SOME DAYTIME MIXING WILL ALLOW THE LOW
CLOUDS TO FINALLY DISSIPATE. AREAS OF CI/CS WILL INVADE THE AREA
TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT OVERALL A RETURN TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKY
ANTICIPATED BY THIS AFTERNOON AND CONTINUE THROUGH TONIGHT.

SURFACE RIDGING WILL PRODUCE LIGHT/CALM WINDS. FOLLOWED GFS MOS
NUMBERS CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...FOCUS OF LONG TERM REVOLVES 
MAINLY AROUND SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION IN THE LATE MONDAY TO EARLY TUESDAY TIME FRAME 
PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS GENERALLY 
DEPICT UPPER LOW CURRENTLY OVER THE SOUTHERN NEW MEXICO REGION TO 
SLOWLY ADVANCE EASTWARD BEFORE WEAKENING INTO AN OPEN WAVE AND 
ACCELERATING NORTHEASTWARD BY TUESDAY. BASED ON THE VERY NATURE OF 
CUT-OFF LOWS...TIMING IS STILL SOMEWHAT OF AN ISSUE. HOWEVER... 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD ENOUGH AGREEMENT...ALONG WITH A MAJORITY OF 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS...TO HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO BUMP UP POPS TO 
LIKELY LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING. BALANCE OF LONG TERM 
APPEARS DRY AT THIS TIME WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF FRIDAY NIGHT 
WHEN ANOTHER SYSTEM AS DEPICTED BY THE ECMWF MODEL APPROACHES. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED MAV/MEX GUIDANCE FAIRLY CLOSELY WITH A 
FEW EXCEPTIONS WHERE THOSE VALUES WERE ADJUSTED BASED ON TRENDS IN 
THE LATEST ENSEMBLE DATA.

310 PM EST FRI DEC 23 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH CHRISTMAS DAY)...MAIN CONCERN FOR
TONIGHT IS HOW MUCH CLOUDS DECREASE. CLOUDS ARE ERODING OVER THE
OHIO VALLEY WHERE DRY AIR AND SUBSIDENCE ARE AT WORK. SEEMS
REASONABLE TO BUY INTO AT LEAST PARTIAL CLEARING IN LINE WITH
PREVIOUS GRIDS...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT AND IN SOMEWHAT AGREEMENT
WITH THE GFS MOS. HOWEVER...I COULD SEE CLOUDS HOLDING IN AT
BROKEN IN COVERAGE FOR SW VA AND NE TN...WHICH COULD AFFECT MIN
TEMP FORECAST. OTHERWISE...DID NOT PUT ANY FOG IN GIVEN CLOUDS.
MOS MISSED MINS BY SEVERAL DEGREES LAST NIGHT (TOO COOL)...BUT TOO
MUCH UNCERTAINTY TO STRAY VERY FAR FROM SIMILAR NAM/GFS MOS MINS
TONIGHT.

KEEPING SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT DRY WITH BOTH MAX AND MIN TEMPS
JUST A FEW DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS. 12Z GFS MODEL RUN LOOKS
MORE CONSISTENT WITH OTHER MODELS (INCLUDING SREF) IN THE NEXT SRN
STREAM SHORTWAVE TO MAINLY SPREAD SOME CLOUDS ACROSS FORECAST AREA
ON SUNDAY. LIMITED RAIN CHANCES TO AREAS SOUTH OF I-40...AND ALSO
MAINLY FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS. NUDGED EXTREME SE TN AND SW NC
COUNTIES UP TO LOW CHANCE TO MESH BETTER WITH FFC'S GOOD CHANCE
POPS. UNLESS SNOW WAS PREFERRED FOR CHRISTMAS DAY...PARTLY SUNNY
WITH HIGHS IN THE 50S SHOULD PLEASE MOST FOLKS...ESPECIALLY THOSE
WITH TRAVEL PLANS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE LONG TERM STARTS
OUT WITH RELATIVELY DECENT FORECAST CONFIDENCE BUT TYPICALLY
DEGRADES FROM ABOUT WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. THE PERIOD STARTS OUT
DRY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING WHILE NEXT SOUTHERN STREAM
SHORT WAVE SHIFTS EAST OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THE UPPER
FEATURE WILL INDUCE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE OVER THE TEXAS GULF COAST
EARLY MONDAY. THE LOW WILL BUILD NORTHEAST INTO WESTERN TENNESSEE
BY 12Z TUESDAY WITH SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION AND
ISENTROPIC LIFT TO PRODUCE LIGHT RAIN ACROSS WESTERN PARTS OF THE
REGION LATER IN THE DAY MONDAY WITH PROGRESSION ACROSS THE ENTIRE
FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS MOISTURE ADVECTION
INCREASES ALONG WITH STRENGTHENING SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT. RAISED POPS
TO MEDIUM CHANCE FOR THE EARLY WEEK SYSTEM WHICH EXITS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS TUESDAY NIGHT. UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL BY
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AND MAINTAINED A DRY PERIOD WHILE THE
FORECAST AREA AWAITS A MORE AMPLIFIED SYSTEM ON FRIDAY. STILL LOOKS
TOO WARM FOR MUCH MENTION OF FROZEN PRECIP AT THIS TIME. ADJUSTED
MAX/MIN TEMPS A CLOSE TO IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN MOS IN
THIS LATE DECEMBER "MILD PATTERN".

RETURNING THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HOWEVER...MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY
WILL REMAIN FOR THE FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS DUE TO CONTINUED UPSLOPE

FOLLOWED GFS MOS NUMBERS CLOSELY FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS DEPICT WEAK SOUTHERN 
STREAM SYSTEM APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY...BUT CONSENSUS IS THAT THIS FEATURE 
WILL STAY MOSTLY SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA. HAVE CONTINUED SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR THE SOUTHERN TIER FOR BOTH OF THOSE PERIODS...BUT 
EVEN THAT MAY BE OVERDONE. PROFOUND DIFFERENCES IN MODEL SOLUTIONS 
SHOW UP WITH NEXT IN THE SERIES OF SYSTEMS ON MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY WITH EUROPEAN MODEL DEPICTING FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM 
AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA WHILE THE GFS DEPICTS ANOTHER WEAK 
SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM PASSING MAINLY SOUTH OF THE AREA. BALANCE OF

SE TX AND NORTH LA. UPPER TROUGH WAS DIGGING SOUTH THROUGH THE
DESERT SW. SKIES WERE CLOUDY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH MILD
TEMPERATURES IN THE 40S WITH PATCHY DENSE FOG OVER NE TN AND SW VA.
SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL RIDE NE FROM TX AND LA ALONG AND NORTH OF THE

WITH A DRY LAYER ABOVE. THUS THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER
OVERNIGHT BUT NOT MUCH CHANCE OF PRECIP. WILL UPDATE TO REMOVE ALL

333 PM EST WED DEC 21 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...RADAR TRENDS SUPPORT RAIN 
CHANCES FALLING SHARPLY THIS EVENING AS COLD FRONT CONTINUES A 
STEADY PUSH EASTWARD. THE ASSOCIATED UPPER LOW IS LIFTING QUICKLY 
ENE OVER THE NRN OHIO VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES REGION...SO FORCING 
WILL BE LIMITED TO ALONG THE COLD FRONT. KEPT IN SOME SLIGHT CHANCE 
TO LOW CHANCE POPS INTO THE EARLY EVENING...THEN DRY OVERNIGHT. 
PARTIAL CLEARING COULD ALLOW FOR PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP...BUT MID AND 
HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE TOO SOON FOR FOG TO BECOME DENSE OR THAT 
SIGNIFICANT. THINK THAT THIS CLOUD COVER PLUS CURRENT DEW POINTS 
SUPPORT GOING A FEW DEGREES ABOVE MOS FOR MINS TONIGHT.

SHOWERS LOOK TO DEVELOP BY LATE THURSDAY MORNING OVER SWRN AREAS 
THEN SPREAD INTO NE TN AND SW VA BY LATE AFTERNOON. SHORT RANGE 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THIS TIMING...AND ALSO CONSISTENT 
WITH PREVIOUS 21/00Z RUN. SRN STREAM SHORTWAVE GENERATES SURFACE LOW 
ALONG THE FRONT AND SUPPORTS NEAR CATEGORICAL POPS FOR AT LEAST THE 
22/21Z TO 23/06Z PERIOD. I NUDGED POPS UP SLIGHTLY TO MESH BETTER 
WITH HIGHER MOS POPS FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. FORCING AND 
INSTABILITY INDICATE GENERAL THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. HIGHS DEPENDENT ON HOW QUICK SHOWERS DEVELOP...SO I STAYED 
CLOSE TO GFS OR A BLEND OF MOS.

THE SHORTWAVE AND SURFACE LOW EXIT THE FORECAST AREA QUICKLY ON 
FRIDAY...SO I LOWERED POPS A BIT SOONER THAN PREVIOUSLY. MOS BLEND 
WAS VERY CLOSE TO GFS MAXES AND FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS 
THE AREA BRINGING DRY WEATHER THROUGH SATURDAY. A SHORTWAVE MOVES IN 
FROM THE WEST ON SUNDAY BRINGING CHANCE POPS INTO THE REGION FOR 
SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. WITH A COLD AIRMASS IN PLACE...MAY SEE A  
WINTRY PRECIPITATION ON SUNDAY NIGHT ACROSS OUR NORTHERN ZONES. HIGH 
PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING A DRY FORECAST FOR MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

A NASHVILLE TN (BNA) TO HUNTSVILLE AL (HSV) LINE. LIGHTNING STRIKES 
HAVE DIMINISHED CONSIDERABLY TO THE POINT THAT THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD

THUNDER BUT INSTABILITY IS VERY LACKING (MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING 
GAVE POSITIVE CAPE OF LESS THAN 300 J/KG). 

VERY MILD TEMPS ABOUND THIS MORNING SO REACHING FORECASTED HIGHS IN 
THE 60S LOOKS GOOD. POPS WERE SHOWN TO DECREASE SLIGHTLY THIS

TONIGHT BUT AS TROUGH DIGS SOUTH OVER THE SW AND NORTHERN MEXICO
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE APPROACHES FROM THE SW. LEFT 20 PERCENT CHANCE
SOUTH BUT MOST OF THE REGION SHOULD BE DRY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE

MS RIVER VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE AREA 
OF CLOUDS OVER THE TN AND LOWER MS RIVER VALLEYS...OCCURRING AHEAD 
OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THESE CLOUDS 
SHOULD KEEP TEMPS FROM FALLING TOO QUICKLY OVERNIGHT OVER THE

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES TO DRIFT EAST BUT MAINTAINS CONTROL OVER SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION AT LEAST THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD. SYSTEM 
CURRENTLY OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS PROJECTED TO SLOWLY APPROACH BY 
TOMORROW. HAVE CONTINUED TO INCREASE POPS FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST TOMORROW. FOR TEMPS...TENDED TO FAVOR BLEND OF MET/MAV 
GUIDANCE WHERE ANY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
LIFT AND MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE PLAINS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
INCREASE QUICKLY TUESDAY NIGHT. UPPER DIVERGENCE NEAR THE NOSE OF 
THE UPPER JET AND A 40-50 KT LLJ WILL RESULT IN CATEGORICAL POPS 
ACROSS THE WHOLE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT AND INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. SOME 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY SUGGESTS AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER. 
NORTHEAST MOVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM WILL BRING DECREASING POPS 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 

THE SURFACE FRONT STALLS JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...THEN BEGINS TO LIFT BACK TO THE NORTH ON THURSDAY IN 
RESPONSE TO A SHORTAVE TROUGH MOVING OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
FAVORABLE POSITIONING OF THE UPPER JET AND STRONG MOISTURE ADVECTION 
FROM THE GULF WILL ARRIVE LATE THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL 
RAISE POPS TO LIKELY WITH THIS SYSTEM...WITH DECREASING POPS ON 
FRIDAY.

THERE IS MUCH UNCERTAINTY FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...AND 
CONFIDENCE IS LOW. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SPREAD AMONG THE GFS 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE QUITE DIFFERENT IN THEIR 
DEPICTIONS OF A CLOSED LOW TRACKING ACROSS THE PLAINS AND OHIO 
VALLEY/GREAT LAKES. AT THIS TIME...A DRY FORECAST IS PREFERED. BOTH 
MODELS DO GENERALLY AGREE THAT THERE WILL BE A SURGE OF COLD AIR 
ARRIVING EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...A WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL SWING 
ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT...WITH A BRIEF SHOT OF COLD ADVECTION.  DO 
NOT EXPECT THIS TO HAVE MUCH IMPACT...BUT MAY SEE SOME ADDITIONAL 
CLOUDS TONIGHT INTO EARLY SUNDAY MAINLY FAR NORTHERN ZONES.  
OTHERWISE SHOULD BE A MOSTLY CLEAR PERIOD WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING IN.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE.   

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...DRY AND MILD CONDITIONS 
PERSIST INTO EARLY TUESDAY BEFORE NEXT IN A SERIES OF SYSTEMS 
APPROACHES BY LATE TUESDAY. BUMPED UP POPS TO LIKELY FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT AS MODELS AND MOST ENSEMBLE MEMBERS NOW GENERALLY AGREE ON THIS 
TIME PERIOD AS HAVING THE BEST COVERAGE. THIS SYSTEM PULLS OUT ON 
WEDNESDAY FOLLOWED BY A BRIEF DRY PERIOD IN THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY TIME FRAME. ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHES BY THURSDAY 
NIGHT. MODELS HAVE EXHIBITED SIGNIFICANT DISAGREEMENTS AND GENERALLY 
POOR RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY WITH RESPECT TO THIS SYSTEM HOWEVER. 
THUS HAVE NOT MADE ANY MAJOR CHANGES FOR THIS EVENT. PRECIP WITH 
BOTH SYSTEMS APPEARS ALL LIQUID AT THIS TIME...ALTHOUGH TRACK OF 
LATTER SYSTEM WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID 
NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

TONIGHT. SOME BKN-OVC CI STREAMING ACROSS THE REGION WITH STRATO
CU ALREADY ON THE MOVE ACROSS MID TENNESSEE. COULD SEE SOME BKN VFR
CEILINGS AROUND 4-5 THOUSAND FEET DEVELOPING AROUND 15-20Z BUT MVFR
FLIGHT WEATHER WITH PREVAILING SHOWERS MAY NOT FORM UNTIL 22Z AND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NORTHERN PLAINS UPPER TROUGH WILL 
PROGRESS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE 
NATION THROUGH THE PERIOD DRAGGING A COLD FRONT INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION BY 12Z FRIDAY. BEST LIFT WILL BE RIGHT ALONG THE 
FRONT IMPACTING MAINLY THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THROUGH EARLY 
AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...LIGHT TO OCCASIONALLY MODERATE SHOWERS WILL 
DEVELOP ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 00Z FRIDAY. THE 
BEST LIFT AND DEEPEST MOISTURE WILL SHIFT SOUTH AND EAST WITH 
FRONTAL MOVEMENT TONIGHT. GENERALLY STAYED WITH LIKELY POPS FOR MOST 
OF THE AREA TONIGHT. WENT WITH A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS IN 
THE SHORT TERM.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A SURFACE FRONT WILL REMAIN 
STALLED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH FRIDAY...WHILE A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH AT 500 MB MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. THE NAM HAS THE 
GREATEST PRECIP DISPLACED TO THE NORTH ACROSS KY IN A ZONE OF 
MIDLEVEL FRONTOGENESIS...WHILE THE GFS PLACES ITS MAX QPF OVER EAST 
TN CLOSER TO THE SURFACE FRONT. THE GFS HAS BEEN MORE CONSISTENT IN 
ITS PLACEMENT AND HAS SUPPORT FROM THE ECMWF AND SREF...SO WILL LEAN 
TOWARD THE GFS. WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS EVERYWHERE ON FRIDAY. DRY 
AIR ALOFT AND COLD ADVECTION FOLLOW QUICKLY BEHIND THE PRECIP FRIDAY 
NIGHT...SO POPS WILL DROP BACK SHARPLY TO NONE/SLIGHT CHANCE EAST 
AFTER 06Z. 

THE FLOW WILL BE NEARLY ZONAL THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WHICH SHOULD 
RESULT IN TRANQUIL CONDITIONS AND NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES. A CLOSED 
LOW TRACKS FROM THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES TO THE OHIO VALLEY MONDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. THE 00Z GFS IS SHOWING THE SYSTEM MOVING 
SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS AND SLOWER THAN THE ECMWF. ISENTROPIC LIFT 
AND A WARM FRONT AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM MAY BRING PRECIP INTO NORTHERN 
AREAS MONDAY NIGHT WITH STRONGER LIFT WITH THE UPPER JET STREAK 
COMING ON TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL DROP THE POPS BACK SLIGHTLY 
FOR MONDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY SOUTH...WITH CHANCE POPS CONTINUING 
FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...VARYING AMOUNTS OF HIGH CLOUDS CONTINUE TO PASS ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...SUCH THAT FAIR OR PARTLY CLOUDY 
SKIES IS A GOOD DESCRIPTOR. UPPER AIR PLOTS PLUS AREA RADAR VAD WIND 
PROFILES SHOW THE LOW LEVEL JET TO BE AROUND 20 TO 25 KNOTS AT THIS 
TIME. THUS...I THINK THAT LLWS CONDITIONS WON'T BE MET FOR ANY OF 
OUR 3 TAF SITES. SOME VALLEY LOCATIONS HAVE DECOUPLED AND TEMPS 
THERE HAVE FALLEN BELOW HOURLY GRID VALUES...AND MAY BE SOME PATCHY 
VALLEY FOG TO DEVELOP...IF HIGH CLOUDS WERE TO STAY THIN OVERNIGHT.

FORECAST IS BASICALLY ON TRACK...BUT I WILL FRESHEN HOURLY TEMPS AND 
DEW POINT TEMPS...PLUS CONSIDER A SLIGHT TWEAK OF MIN TEMPS AS 
NEEDED.

CLOUDS...AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF PATCHY VALLEY FOG. LOW LEVEL JET 
WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED OVERNIGHT FOR POSSIBLE LLWS AT CHA...
BUT I KEPT THIS OUT OF THE CHA TAF FOR NOW. 

SHOWERS SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON THURSDAY...SO I ONLY 
ADDED VCSH LATE AND KEPT VFR CONDITIONS. THE SW WINDS MAY GET A BIT 
GUSTY AHEAD OF THE SHOWERS.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE EXITING TO
THE EAST AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES DURING THE SHORT TERM. EXPECT
AN INCREASE IN MAINLY HIGH CLOUDS TONIGHT...THEN SHOWERS WILL MOVE
INTO WEST AND NORTHWEST ZONES BY LATE MORNING AND THEN SPREAD
ACROSS REMAINDER OF THE AREA. WILL CARRY CAT POPS FOR NORTHERN
PLATEAU...DOWN TO CHANCE POPS EAST AND SOUTHEAST ZONES BY LATE IN
THE DAY. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST SOME MINOR
TWEAKS...MAINLY UP A DEGREE OR TWO IN PLACES.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT TO MOVE 
THROUGH REGION THURSDAY NIGHT BUT SURFACE LOW TO THE SW IS EXPECTED 
TO MOVE ALONG THE FRONT FRIDAY WITH MOISTURE COMING BACK NORTH TO 
CONTINUE SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND INTO THE EVENING. RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS UP TO ABOUT ONE INCH FROM THURSDAY EVENING THROUGH FRIDAY 
AND ONLY VERY LIGHT AMOUNTS FRIDAY EVENING. COOL HIGH PRESSURE 
TO SET UP OVER REGION FOR THE WEEKEND THROUGH MONDAY. TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE MILD THURSDAY NIGHT IN THE 40S TO NEAR 50 BUT COOLER FRIDAY. 
CLOUDS DECREASING LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND COLDER IN THE 30S. LOOKS TO

ON THE WEEKEND AND SLIGHTLY WARMER MONDAY WITH INCREASING CLOUDS. 
NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM APPROACHES MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. A FRONT 
MOVES DOWN FROM THE NW TUESDAY WITH RAIN SPREADING INTO THE

ERODED FOR THE TIME BEING. RELATIVELY HIGH DEW POINTS IN PLACE. 
TEMPERATURES DROPPING ON SCHEDULE. FOG FORMATION CONTINUES TO BE A 
GOOD BET OVERNIGHT. CLOUD COVER INVASION FROM THE WEST WILL 
DETERMINE EXTENT AND DEGREE OF FOG DENSITY BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. 
SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:

SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...SATELLITE SHOWS LOW 
CLOUDS SLOWLY ERODING FROM THE SOUTH AND EAST. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW 
TRAPPED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FINALLY DISSIPATING. BOUNDARY LAYER 
WESTERLY WINDS WILL HELP ERODE THE CLOUDS INTO THE VALLEY...BUT 
CONSIDERABLE HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL REPLACE. 
HOWEVER...ENOUGH RADIATIONAL COOLING COMBINED WITH LOW DEWPOINT 
DEPRESSIONS WILL ALLOW FOG TO DEVELOP. SURFACE RELATIVE HUMIDITY 
VALUES APPROACH 100 PERCENT...SO WILL CALL FOR AREAS OF FOG SOUTH 
AND PATCHY NORTH WHERE MORE CLOUDS ARE ANTICIPATED. SOME OF THE FOG 
WILL LIKELY BECOME DENSE.

LATER SHIFT MAY NEED TO ISSUE A DENSE FOG ADVISORY.

FOR WEDNESDAY...UPPER AND SURFACE RIDING WILL PRODUCE AN 
UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY WITH PARTLY-MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY.  FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST ALLOWING SOUTHERLY WINDS TO 
INCREASE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER. TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY BE WARMER 
JUST OFF THE SURFACE AS SURFACE WINDS DECOUPLE.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THIS FORECAST PERIOD BEGINS 
WITH THE UPPER LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVERHEAD...BUT STARTING TO 
FEEL THE SQUEEZE FROM THE TROUGH IN THE PLAINS THAT IS ENCROACHING 
FROM THE NORTHWEST...WITH THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT CLOSING IN ON 
MEMPHIS.  FRONT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL PASS THROUGH E TN THURSDAY 
NIGHT...BUT SHOWERS LOOK TO BE WELL IN ADVANCE OF FRONT WITH A GOOD 
THREAT OF SHOWERS BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN OUR NWRN AREAS.  FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY DOES NOT INITIALLY MAKE IT VERY FAR AWAY...WILL NEED TO

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...SATELLITE SHOWS 
LOW CLOUDS SLOWLY ERODING FROM THE SOUTH AND EAST. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
SHOW TRAPPED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FINALLY DISSIPATING. BOUNDARY LAYER 
WESTERLY WINDS WILL HELP ERODE THE CLOUDS INTO THE VALLEY...BUT 
CONSIDERABLE HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL REPLACE. 
HOWEVER...ENOUGH RADIAITIONAL COOLING COMBINED WITH LOW DEWPOINT 
DEPRESSIONS WILL ALLOW FOG TO DEVELOP. SURFACE RELATIVE HUMIDITY 
VALLUES APPROACH 100 PERCENT...SO WILL CALL FOR AREAS OF FOG SOUTH 
AND PATCHY NORTH WHERE MORE CLOUDS ARE ANTICIPATED. SOME OF THE FOG 
WILL LIKELY BECOME DENSE.

LATER SHIFT MAY NEED TO ISSUE A DENSE FOG ADVISORY.

FOR WEDNESDAY...UPPER AND SURFACE RIDING WILL PRODUCE AN 
UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY WITH PARTLY-MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY.  FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST ALLOWING SOUTHERLY WINDS TO 
INCREASE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER. TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY BE WARMER 
JUST OFF THE SURFACE AS SURFACE WINDS DECOUPLE.

IN THIS AFTERNOON...WITH DECREASING CLOUDS EXPECTED THROUGH THE DAY. 
A RIDGE WILL BE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN US TONIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY...PROVIDING TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL. AN EASTWARD

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
AN 850 MB HIGH OFF THE NC COAST WILL PROVIDE A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL 
FLOW OF WARM MOIST AIR INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY. WEAK 
ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE WILL PROVIDE SOME SHALLOW LIFT WITHIN THE MOIST 
LAYER. THE MODELS ARE IN DISAGREEMENT WITH THE DEPTH OF THE MOIST 
LAYER...WITH THE NAM SHOWING DEEPER MOISTURE AND THUS MORE PRECIP 
THAN THE GFS. BASED ON THE 00Z FFC SOUNDING WHICH SHOWS A VERY DRY 
LAYER ABOVE 800 MB...WILL LEAN TOWARD THE DRIER GFS AND SREF 
SOLUTIONS. MUCH OF THE AREA WILL SEE OVERCAST CLOUDS AND AREAS OF 
DRIZZLE TODAY. DUE TO THE SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE AND WEAK 
LIFT...MEASURABLE PRECIP WILL BE DIFFICULT TO ATTAIN...AND WILL 
CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP ONLY IN THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES. 
CLOUD COVER SHOULD ALSO HOLD HIGH TEMPS IN THE 40S IN MOST SPOTS. 
TONIGHT THE 850 MB FLOW BECOMES MORE WESTERLY...WITH MOISTURE 
DECREASING FROM THE TOP DOWN. HOWEVER THE MODELS INDICATE QUITE A 
BIT OF NEAR-SURFACE MOISTURE...SO WILL KEEP CLOUD COVER HIGH TONIGHT 
WITH LOWS ON THE WARM SIDE OF GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE 
REGION PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. A FRONT IS 
EXPECTED TO TRACK THROUGH THE REGION IN THE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TIME 
FRAME BRINGING A CHANCE FOR RAIN SHOWERS. WILL KEEP HIGHEST ON  
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT WHEN THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT IS 
ANTICIPATED. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. GFS  
IS FASTER THAN THE ECMWF IN TIMING WITH THE FRONT. GFS HAS A DRIER 
WEATHER MOVING INTO THE AREA ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WHILE THE 
ECMWF HAS THE FRONT LINGERING OVER THE AREA. WITH STILL MUCH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID 
ATLANTIC REGION...WITH A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. THIS HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC TONIGHT...WITH A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW DEVELOPING ON 
THE BACK SIDE OF IT OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MODELS INDICATE 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME VERY LIGHT PRECIP DEVELOPING OVER SOUTHWEST 
NC AND SOUTHEAST TN TOWARDS SUNRISE...AS ISENTROPIC LIFT SLOWLY 
INCREASES OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WITH SURFACE TEMPS POSSIBLY STILL 
LINGERING AROUND THE FREEZING MARK IN THE VALLEY AREAS OF SOUTHWEST 
NC...THERE MIGHT BE SOME LIGHT FREEZING RAIN TOWARDS SUNRISE. RIGHT 
NOW...IT APPEARS THAT LIMITED MOISTURE SHOULD KEEP ANY PRECIP VERY 
LIGHT IN INTENSITY...AND CURRENT DEWPOINTS ARE HIGHER THAN FORECAST 
WHICH SHOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF ADDITIONAL EVAPORATIVE COOLING 
POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT. THUS...WILL ONLY MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
LIGHT FREEZING RAIN OVER SOUTHWEST NC TONIGHT. AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE 
THEN BEGINS TO DEVELOP OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY TUESDAY...WHICH 
SHOULD HELP TO WARM TEMPS ABOVE NORMAL. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT... 
AND WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER NAM NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT 
SINCE DEWPOINTS ARE CURRENTLY HIGHER THAN EXPECTED AND CLOUDS ARE 
EXPECTED TO INCREASE TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...WILL TREND TOWARDS A 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO GUIDANCE SETS AFTER TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WE WILL BEGIN THE EXTENDED 
WITH A SHORT-WAVE MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAIN STATES TOWARD 
THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BEFORE BECOMING NEAR 
STATIONARY ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES BY FRIDAY. AS UPPER FLOW 
REMAINS WEST TO SOUTHWEST FOR FRIDAY...ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL HELP TO 
KEEP A CHANCE OF RAIN FOR THE FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER STRONG UPPER 
TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT BASIN/SOUTHWEST FRIDAY-SATURDAY... 
THEN PULL NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAIN STATES SUNDAY. WEAK ISENTROPIC 
LIFT OVER THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE GULF COASTS WILL KEEP 
CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA NEXT WEEKEND...BUT RAIN CHANCES 
WILL BE SLIM. CONFIDENCE FOR THE EXTENDED LOW DUE TO MODEL 
INCONSISTENCIES FROM MODEL RUNS.

VALLEYS. THIS HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD OVER THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...DURING THIS PERIOD THE UPPER 
FLOW IS CONTROLLED BY THE GREAT POLAR VORTEX OVER HUDSON BAY.  THE 
SHORTWAVE THAT BROUGHT THE SNOW YESTERDAY HAS MOVED OFF TO THE 
NORTHEAST...WHILE THE NEXT SHORTWAVE IS A CLIPPER HEADED SEWD TOWARD 
THE AREA.  BY THE END OF THIS PERIOD THIS CLIPPER IS STILL 
UPSTREAM.  AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE FILLS IN QUICKLY AND 
LOOSENS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT.  

ONLY SLIGHT ISSUE THIS FORECAST IS THE STRATUS CLOUD COVER...IT IS 
DISSIPATING...BUT VERY SLOWLY.  WILL INCLUDE MORE CLOUD COVER OVER 
UPSLOPE AREAS IN THE APPALACHIANS AND INTO SW VA.

FOR TEMPS...WENT VERY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS FAIRLY CONSISTENT 
WITH WEATHER PATTERN OUT TO EARLY NEXT WEEK...SHOWING A DRY PERIOD 
WITH TEMPS RECOVERING BY SUNDAY AND ACTUALLY A FEW DEGREES ABOVE 
CLIMO BY MONDAY TO WEDNESDAY. A NRN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
PASSING OVER GREAT LAKES AND OHIO RIVER VALLEY WILL BRING A FEW 
CLOUDS FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT MAIN EFFECT WILL BE TO KEEP TEMPS ON THE 
COOL SIDE FOR SATURDAY. 

SLIGHTLY DIFFERING PATTERN BY LATE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
WITH ECMWF MORE AMPLIFIED AND GFS MORE ZONAL ACROSS THE SE STATES. 
GFS STILL ADVERTISES A DEEPENING SHORTWAVE TROUGH/LOW OVER THE SRN 
PLAINS FOR DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY). EITHER PATTERN SEEMS TO ONLY SUPPORT 
VERY LOW SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW...AND FOR CONTINUITY I KEPT 
THESE POPS JUST FOR TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT AND AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE SLIGHTLY FOR BOTH DAYS 6 
AND 7...WITH THIS REFLECTED IN THE TRENDS FROM 07/12Z GFSX TO 08/00Z

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH COLDER TEMP IN THE 30S 
MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AXIS OVER THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL CONTINUE TO SWING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED PRECIP 
EXPECTED CHANGING TO SNOW BEFORE ENDING. THE MAIN QUESTION FOR OUR 
AREA INVOLVES HOW MUCH SNOW WILL BE ABLE TO ACCUMULATE WITH WARM 
GROUND TEMPS...AND AIR TEMPS ACROSS THE VALLEYS IN THE UPPER 30S TO 
LOWER 40S. EXPECT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...MAINLY ABOVE 2000 FEET... 
TO BE ABLE TO COOL ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS... 
SO WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER WX ADVISORIES FOR THESE AREAS. IN THE 
VALLEY AREAS...WARMER GROUND AND AIR TEMPS SHOULD LIMIT ANY SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS TO THE GRASSY SURFACES AND KEEP THEM AROUND AN INCH OR 
LESS...SO WILL NOT ISSUE AN ADVISORY FOR THE GREAT TN VALLEY AT THIS 
TIME. IT APPEARS THE MAIN POTENTIAL THREAT FOR ROADWAYS WITH THIS 
SYSTEM WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME AREAS OF BLACK ICE DEVELOPING 
OVERNIGHT...AS TEMPS FALL BELOW FREEZING LATER THIS EVENING. WILL 
PLAN TO ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT OUTSIDE OF THE ADVISORY 
AREAS TO ADDRESS THIS POSSIBILITY. OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
SETTLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH FRIDAY...BRINGING COOLER BUT 
DRY CONDITIONS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL BE 
LIMITED WITH ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY NIGHT...SO WILL KEEP 
THE FORECAST DRY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS APPEAR 
TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...STAYED CLOSER TO AN 
ECMWF/CANADIAN SOLUTION FOR THE LONG TERM. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL BE EXITING THE REGION EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH BUILDING HEIGHTS 
TO FOLLOW. THIS SHOULD KEEP A NICE DRY FORECAST GOING RIGHT THROUGH 
THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK WEEK. A NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT ARE PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY HOWEVER....MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT 
WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THIS FEATURE AND DEPTH OF MOISTURE SO STAYED 
WITH CONTINUITY AND KEPT PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION IN THE SLIGHT 
CHANCE RANGE FOR THIS FROPA. THE UNSETTLED WEATHER SHOULD BE OUT OF 
THE PICTURE BY WEDNESDAY AS A SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH AMPLIFIES OUT 
WEST. THIS MAY ALLOW FOR ANOTHER DRY DAY ON WEDNESDAY. TRENDED 
TEMPERATURE FORECAST CLOSER TO HPC WHICH FOLLOWS THE EUROPEAN 
CANADIAN MODEL FOR THE LONG TERM.

BASE OF THE TROUGH WILL LEAD TO A MIXTURE OF LIGHT RAIN AND SNOW
FOR A BRIEF PERIOD WITH A CHANGE TO LIGHT SNOW FOR APPROXIMATELY
TWO TO THREE HOURS AT TYS AND TRI. FLIGHT CONDITIONS SHOULD
DETERIORATE TO IFR AT ALL TERMINALS BETWEEN 21-03Z AS THE BEST
LIFT WITH THE UPPER FEATURE BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION. STAYED
PESSIMISTIC WITH MVFR CEILINGS UNTIL ABOUT 10-12Z THURSDAY. AFTER
THIS VFR FLIGHT WILL BE THE RULE WITH DRY ADVECTION AND BUILDING

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH COLDER AIR MOVING INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH TEMPS ALREADY IN THE UPPER 30S OVER THE 
PLATEAU. A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WAS PRODUCING AN EXTENSIVE AREA 
OF SNOW OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH TWO TO 
THREE INCHES OF SNOW ALREADY BEING REPORTED ACROSS WEST TN AND 
NORTHERN MS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS UPPER TROUGH AND 
ITS ASSOCIATED PRECIP WILL QUICKLY SWING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH RAIN EXPECTED TO CHANGE SNOW IN MOST 
LOCATIONS. THE MAIN QUESTION FOR OUR AREA INVOLVES HOW MUCH SNOW 
WILL BE ABLE TO ACCUMULATE WITH WARM GROUND TEMPS...AND AIR TEMPS IN 
THE VALLEYS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE UPPER 30S TO NEAR 40 BY THE TIME 
THE UPPER TROUGH SWINGS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. IT APPEARS THAT THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS...MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FEET...WILL BE ABLE TO COOL 
ENOUGH TO ALLOW SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. 

WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO EXPAND THE WINTER WX 
ADVISORY TO INCLUDE THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES THIS 
AFTERNOON...WHERE AN INCH OR TWO OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE ABOVE 1500 FEET...BUT WARMER TEMPS IN THE SEQUATCHIE VALLEY 
MAY PREVENT ANY ACCUMULATIONS THERE. ALSO...WILL INCLUDE THE REST OF 
SOUTHWEST VA IN THE ADVISORY...BUT WILL NOT INCLUDE NORTHEAST TN AT 
THIS TIME SINCE SNOWFALL MAY HAVE A TOUGH TIME ACCUMULATING IN THE 
LOWER ELEVATIONS. HOWEVER...THIS AREA MAY NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE 
ADVISORY THIS AFTERNOON...DEPENDING ON THE AFTERNOON TEMP AND PRECIP 
TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW CONTINUES 
IN ADVANCE OF AMPLIFIED AND POSITIVELY-TILTED UPPER TROUGH CURRENTLY 
STRETCHING FROM THE GREAT LAKES INTO TEXAS. COLDER AIR EXPECTED TO 
FLOW INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TODAY AS UPPER TROUGH 
SWINGS EASTWARD. TEMPS WILL GENERALLY FALL THROUGH THE DAY AS TROUGH 
AXIS AND SURFACE FRONT SHIFT EAST OF THE AREA. MODEL TIME HEIGHTS 
DEPICT MOISTURE DEPARTING QUITE RAPIDLY BEHIND TROUGH AXIS. THIS ALONG 
WITH RELATIVELY WARM GROUND TEMPS SHOULD LIMIT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS AS 
PRECIP TRANSITIONS TO SNOW THIS AFTERNOON. NEVERTHELESS...WILL 
CONTINUE ADVISORY AS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED AS SNOWFALL MAY BECOME 
BRIEFLY HEAVY BEFORE DEPARTING...ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
FOR TEMPS...MAV AND MET GUIDANCE GENERALLY CLOSE AND LOOKS 
REASONABLE.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE UPPER TROUGH EXITS
ACTUALLY BEFORE THURSDAY MORNING...SO WEATHER SHOULD MAKE A RAPID
IMPROVEMENT TOWARD DAYBREAK. SOME ZONAL FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPS FOR
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...WITH A NRN STREAM SHORTWAVE PASSING TO OUR
NORTH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO RIVER VALLEY REGIONS BY
FRIDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER FOR OUR AREA...BUT A FEW CLOUDS EXPECTED. 

ZONAL FLOW OR WEAK RIDGING ALOFT IS SHOWN FOR THE WEEKEND INTO
EARLY NEXT WEEK. SURFACE TO 850 MB RIDGING LOOKS TO KEEP ANY GULF
MOISTURE SHUT OFF...SO DRY WEATHER FOR THESE PERIODS. GFS AND ECMWF
DIFFER SLIGHTLY ON HOW ANY PRECIPITATION MIGHT DEVELOP MONDAY NIGHT
INTO TUESDAY...WITH A GOOD BET FOR MORE DRY WEATHER. HOWEVER...PER
COORDINATION WITH NWS NEIGHBORS...WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN
FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT FOR NOW.

OTHERWISE...GFSX MOS MAX/MIN TEMPS LOOK CONSISTENT OVER THE PAST 2
TO 3 RUNS. TEMP GRIDS WERE CLOSE TO THESE VALUES AND JUST SOME VERY
MINOR TWEAKS NEEDED.

FRONT EXITS TO THE AREA. UPPER LOW ENTERS THE AREA TONIGHT AND INTO 
INTO THURSDAY SO WILL CONTINUE CATEGORICAL POPS FOR BOTH PERIODS. 
GETTING SOME COLD AIR STREAMING INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY. 
EXPECTING SOME SNOW BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. BUT TOO WARM FOR MUCH 
ACCUMULATION EXCEPT MAINLY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATION. SO WILL GO FOR 
ONLY ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATION. WITH THE RAIN...STAYED 
CLOSER TO COOLER MAV FOR TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...TREND OF MODELS HAS 
BEEN TO SPEED UP EXIT OF THE WEDNESDAY SYSTEM...SO WILL HAVE LIKELY 
POPS NORTHEAST TO NO HIGHER THAN SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTHWEST ZONES FOR 
THE FIRST FEW HOURS WED NIGHT...THEN WILL QUICKLY TAPER OFF TO BE 
DRY BY 06Z.  ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF AN INCH OR SO WILL BE 
POSSIBLE IN SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE SMOKIES AND 
NORTHEAST BEFORE THE PRECIP ENDS. A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO MOVE 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT MOISTURE LOOKS VERY LIMITED SO FOR NOW 
WILL KEEP CURRENT DRY FORECAST AND JUST HAVE SOME INCREASE IN CLOUDS 
AS THIS FRONT MOVES THROUGH.  SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE DRY THROUGH AT 
LEAST SUNDAY.  SOME UNCERTAINTY FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD AS 
MODEL AGREEMENT AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IS POOR.  GFS HAS NEXT 
SYSTEM MOVING IN BY TUESDAY...WITH ECMWF EARLIER ON MONDAY.  FOR NOW

NEAR OUR WESTERN MOST AREAS. UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT SEEMS LACKING AS
EARLIER RIGHT REAR QUAD OF UPPER JET HAS EXITED THE REGION. MAIN
REASON FOR THE INCREASE IN SHOWERS SEEMS TO BE MOST LIKELY DUE TO
AN INCREASE IN FRONTOGENETIC FORCING FROM SURFACE TO 850 MBS. NAM

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...RADAR INDICATING COVERAGE 
INCREASING ALONG OUR WESTERN ZONES ASSOCIATED WITH COLD FRONT WHICH 
IS EXPECTED TO TRACK THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. WILL KEEP 
CATEGORICAL POPS FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. THE HEAVIEST RAIN SHOULD 
HOLD OFF UNTIL LATE THIS EVENING AND INTO TUESDAY MORNING. WITH THE 
CLOUDS AND RAIN OVER THE AREA...STAYED CLOSER TO COOLER MAV FOR 
TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CONFIDENCE LOWER THAN 
AVERAGE FOR EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST...AS MODEL AGREEMENT AND RUN 
TO RUN CONSISTENCY NOT GOOD.  HOW STRONG SHORT WAVE THAT COMES 
ACROSS WED/EARLY WED NIGHT WILL BE STILL UNCERTAIN...BUT LOOKS LIKE 
A SURFACE WAVE WILL FORM ON THE FRONT TO OUR EAST AS THIS SHORT WAVE 
APPROACHES.  WILL HAVE TO RAISE POPS TO LIKELY AND CATEGORICAL FOR 
AT LEAST LATTER HALF OF TUE NIGHT INTO FIRST HALF OF WED NIGHT.  
ALSO...PRECIP TYPE BECOMES A CONCERN BY WED EVENING AS FREEZING 
LEVELS FALL...AT LEAST FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN.  WHILE UNCERTAINTY 
LEVEL IS STILL HIGH AT THIS POINT...SOME SNOW ACCUMULATION APPEARS 
POSSIBLE AT LEAST IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  WILL MENTION IN HWO.  A 
DRY COLD FRONT FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT WITH SOME 
CLOUDS...BUT OVERALL THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD LOOKS TO 
BE FAIRLY UNEVENTFUL WITH MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS AND TEMPERATURES 
GENERALLY AROUND TO A BIT BELOW SEASONAL NORMS.

.DISCUSSION...RADAR INDICATING A FEW ECHOES TRACKING ACROSS MIDDLE 
TN. IT SHOULD TRACKING INTO THE CWA AS THE FRONT NEARS. IT SHOULD BE 
LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING HOURS BEFORE THE HEAVIER 
RAIN SHOULD ARRIVE. 850 JET SHOULD CONTINUE TO DECREASE THIS 
AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. WILL 
UPDATE FORECAST TO REMOVE MORNING GROUP. NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST HAVE MOVED EAST TO ALONG AND WEST OF I-65 
THIS MORNING. MOSTLY MID TO HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA
...ALTHO A LOWER CLOUD DECK HAS SPREAD INTO PARTS OF SE TN AND SW 
NC. LOW LEVEL JET AHEAD OF THE FRONT APPEARS TO BE AROUND 30 TO 35 
KNOTS PER RADAR WIND PROFILES AND 05/00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS...SO SOME 
GUSTY SE-S WINDS EARLY THIS MORNING IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN SPOTS.
RESULT OF THIS IS VERY MILD TEMPS IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S TO 
START THE DAY.

PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKED VERY GOOD FOR TIMING SHOWERS REACHING EAST TN 
LATER TODAY...THEN 90 TO 100 PERCENT POPS FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY AS 
COLD FRONT SLOWS OR STALLS BRIEFLY ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS. HEAVIER 
RAINS SHOULD BE TONIGHT...WHEN FRONTOGENETIC FORCING IS BEST OVER 
PLATEAU AND SE TN...PLUS AT LEAST WEAK UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE. 
MODELS SHOW MUCH WEAKENING AFTER 06Z TUESDAY...SO EVEN THOUGH 
SHOWERS LINGER INTO WEDNESDAY...RAIN AMOUNTS SHOULD FALL SHARPLY.
LOOKS LIKE A GENERAL 1 TO 2 INCH RAIN EVENT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT
...IN LINE WITH LATEST HPC QPF. 

INSTABILITY IS LACKING AND UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT IS MINIMAL...SO NO 
MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS. OTHERWISE...NAM MOS HIGHS A LITTLE OUT OF 
REACH WITH GFS MAXES BETTER CHOICE FOR TODAY. SIMILAR MOS MINS 
ACCEPTED FOR TONIGHT...AND MOS HIGHS TUESDAY VERY REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SLOW MOVING COLD
FRONT WILL HAVE PROGRESSED TO NEAR THE APPALACHIAN CREST BY 00Z
WEDNESDAY. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE MUCH LOWER BEHIND THE FRONT
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. UPPER LOW ON BACKSIDE OF SYSTEM WILL
ENHANCE PRECIPITATION WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO THURSDAY.
FREEZING LEVELS DROP LOW ENOUGH FOR A SMALL AMOUNT OF SNOW LATE
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. COOL
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN THURSDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUES THROUGH THE
WEEKEND. A WEAK SYSTEM MAY BRING A FEW CLOUDS TO THE AREA FRIDAY
NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY OTHERWISE THE REGION WILL HAVE MOSTLY
FAIR SKIES AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...AIRMASS WILL SLOWLY MODIFY 
THROUGH THE PERIOD AS HIGH PRESSURE WEAKENS TOWARD THE EAST. HIGH 
LEVEL CLOUDS WILL STREAM ACROSS THE AREA. MOISTURE WILL LOWER TO THE 
MID LEVELS ON SUNDAY. SOME LOW LEVEL CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO DEVELOP 
ACROSS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE MRX CWA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL BE MODERATED BY CLOUD COVER. LEANED TOWARD 
THE WARM SIDE OF GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MAIN EVENT IS DEEP 
UPPER TROUGH MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE MID-SECTION OF THE NATION 
TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. MODELS SHOW STRONG DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPING OVER THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH UNSEASONABLY HIGH PW 
VALUES. SERIES OF JET STREAKS WILL ENHANCE LIFT FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH THE FORECAST AREA UNDER PERIODS OF STRONG DIVERGENCE 
ALOFT AND AGEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION FORCING.

THE STRONG AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL CIRCULATION WILL HELP ENHANCE THE 
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING ENHANCING PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE AREA BOTH 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. RAINFALL OF 3 TO 5 INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE...
ESPECIALLY FOR THE PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...AND SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA. 

SYSTEM WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH COLDER 
AIR CHANGING THE PRECIPITATION TO SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
BEFORE ENDING. ONLY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED.

FAIRLY WEAK RIDGING WILL DOMINATE THE REST OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS PLUS RIDGING ALOFT OVER THE
SE STATES...WILL KEEP THE FORECAST AREA DRY WELL BEYOND THE NEXT
24 HOURS. TRANSIENT HIGH CLOUDS THIS MORNING MAY THIN OUT BY LATE
MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON. THUS...PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TO REACH AT
LEAST A BLEND OF SIMILAR MOS HIGHS FOR TODAY. GFS MOS WAS FAIRLY
CLOSE ON FRIDAY HIGHS...SO I STAYED VERY MUCH IN LINE. SO FAR...NOT
SEEING MUCH IF ANY PATCHY AREAS OF FOG OR FREEZING FOG DEVELOP.
PLAN TO KEEP THIS FOG OUT OF THE FORECAST AND WILL COVER IN THE
SHORT TERM FORECAST IF ANY FOG DOES DEVELOP PRIOR TO DAYBREAK.

FOR TONIGHT...ANOTHER TRICKY MIN TEMP FORECAST GIVEN THE VERY LIGHT 
WINDS IN SHELTERED VALLEYS...AND POSSIBLE INCREASING CLOUDS LATE 
TONIGHT. FORECASTED MINS IN A SIMILAR PATTERN TO WHAT IS BEING 
OBSERVED THIS MORNING...WITH ABOUT A 15 DEGREE OR SO DIFFERENCE
FROM VALLEYS TO HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE LIGHT SOUTH WINDS ARE A
FACTOR.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STRONG RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
AT SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL BE ANCHORED ALONG THE EAST COAST SUNDAY 
WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BRINGING ABUNDANT MOISTURE INTO THE LOWER 
MS AND LOWER TN VALLEYS TO THE WEST OF THE CWA. CLOUDS WILL 
GRADUALLY INCREASE FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST WITH WINDS INCREASING 
FROM THE SOUTH. NO RAIN IS EXPECTED. SUNDAY NIGHT RIDGING SHOULD 
HOLD WITH A FEW SHOWERS ON THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY BUT DRY 
ELSEWHERE. LOWS WARMER IN THE 40S. MONDAY BASIC UPPER FLOW STILL 
MAINLY SOUTHWEST WITH RAIN CONTINUING OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND 
WESTERN TN VALLEY AND ONLY A FEW HUNDREDTHS MAKING IT INTO EAST TN. 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY FRONT FINALLY GETS A PUSH EAST WITH SHOWERS 
BECOMING LIKELY. THINK RAINFALL AMOUNTS MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE LIGHT 
WITH SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL HOLDING OFF NOW UNTIL TUESDAY AND TUESDAY 
NIGHT. TOTAL AMOUNTS NOW MAY ONLY BE AROUND 1 TO 2 INCHES BEFORE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...DRY SHORT WAVE MOVING 
EAST THROUGH THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS EARLY TONIGHT. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE MID SOUTH AND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES TONIGHT. LATE NIGHT FOG WILL DEVELOP OVER 
WATERWAYS AND CONTINUE INTO THE MORNING HOURS. SATURDAY WARM UP GETS 
GOING WITH SOME HIGH CLOUDS STREAMING ACROSS THE AREA. SURFACE RIDGE 
SHIFTS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY WITH CONTINUED WARMING AND 
INCREASED HIGH LEVEL CLOUD COVER. REMOVED POPS FOR SUNDAY AND BACKED 
OFF ON PRECIPITATION SUNDAY NIGHT AS BEST FORCING REMAINS WEST OF 
THE AREA. WARM MIN TEMPS BY MONDAY MORNING AND WENT A BIT ABOVE 
GUIDANCE.   


.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...BY THIS TIME...THE HEAVY 
RAIN-MAKER SHOULD BE ENCROACHING ON THE WESTERN CWA. THE QPF 
FORECAST IN THE GRIDS ONLY GOES THROUGH MONDAY...WHEREAS THE 
HEAVIEST RAINS LOOK TO BE MOVING IN MONDAY NIGHT AND INTO 
TUESDAY...WITH CURRENT MODEL TIMING...AND CONTINUING THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY OR SO.  LOOKING LIKE PRECIP AXIS WILL BE ORIENTED SSW-NNE. 

PRESENTLY TOTALS IN OUR AREA LOOK LIKE THEY WILL BE HEAVIEST IN THE 
WEST...WITH 2-3 INCH TOTALS IN THE WESTERN AREAS/PLATEAU ETC...1-2 
INCH VALUES IN THE HEART OF THE TENN VALLEY...AROUND AN INCH 
EAST...AND LESS THAN AN INCH IN THE TYPICALLY RAIN-SHADOWED AREAS OF 
THE NORTHEASTERN CWA.  WE'LL HAVE TO WATCH FOR TRENDS...AS MUCH 
HEAVIER AMOUNTS ARE FORECAST TO OUR WEST.

LOOKING AT THE AIR MASS IN THIS EVENT...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 
ARE FORECAST TO BE 1.2 TO 1.3 INCHES OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...EXCEPT AROUND 1.1 INCHES IN THE NORTHEAST.  THIS TRANSLATES 
TO AROUND THE 90TH PERCENTILE ON DECEMBER PRECIPITABLE WATER 
CLIMATOLOGY...JUST BELOW THE 2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS THRESHOLD.  THIS 
IS ON-PAR WITH THE AXIS OVER WESTERN AND MIDDLE TENN...JUST THAT THE 
AXIS OF RAIN IS EXPECTED TO BE OVER E TENN FOR A MUCH SHORTER 
DURATION.

THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO BE WARM THROUGHOUT ALL OF THE 
PRECIPITATION...AND THE MOISTURE CLEARS OUT SO QUICKLY...THAT IT 
LOOKS LIKE THERE WON'T BE ANY POST-FRONTAL UPSLOPE SNOWS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.

WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPS...FRONTAL TIMING AND PRECIP WILL 
DICTATE LARGER DEVIATIONS.   WITH SLOWER MOVEMENT EXPECTED...FOR 
MONDAY MAX TEMPS...WARMED UP EASTERN HALF ABOVE GUIDANCE...WITH 
SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER IN TYPICAL DOWNSLOPE AREAS IN NE TN.
KEPT MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY MORNING LOWS QUITE MILD OVER MOST OF THE 
AREA...CONSIDERING WARM AIR MASS AND CLOUD COVER.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL
BUILD IN FROM THE WEST. LOW LEVELS WILL CONTINUE TO DRY OUT. 
DECREASED CLOUD COVER...LOWER HUMIDITIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW 
FOR GOOD COOLING OVERNIGHT. WEAK LOW LEVEL COLD AIR ADVECTION IS 
SHORT LIVED AS WARM AIR ADVECTION SLOWLY RETURNS ON THURSDAY. 
AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WILL APPROACH NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...GENERALLY DRY 
WEATHER REGIME WITH SLOWLY MODERATING TEMPS IN STORE THROUGH MOST OF 
THE WEEKEND AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES THE AREA BY LATE SUNDAY. MEDIUM-RANGE 
MODELS ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ONSET TIMING OF 
PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM...BUT DIFFER PROFOUNDLY ON THE 
PROGRESSION THROUGH THE REGION AS THE EUROPEAN MODEL DEPICTS A MUCH 
MORE AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH THAN THE GFS WHICH PUSHES THE SURFACE 
FRONT THROUGH MUCH SOONER. GFS FORESTALLS FRONTAL BOUNDARY AS UPPER 
FLOW REMAINS SOUTHWESTERLY BEFORE FINALLY PUSHING THE BOUNDARY 
THROUGH BY LATE TUESDAY. MOST GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ROUGHLY SPLIT 
THE DIFFERENCE AND ARE PREFERRED. DRY ALBEIT COOLER WEATHER RETURNS 
BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH 
FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR NORTH OVER OHIO. AIRMASS HAS REALLY CHILLED 
DOWN WITH 30/00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOWING 850 MBS TEMPS -4 TO -5 DEGS
CELSIUS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SURFACE TO LOW LEVEL FLOW IS 
MOSTLY SW-W NOT REALLY AN IDEAL SET UP FOR UPSLOPE FLOW TO ENHANCE 
ANY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. HOWEVER...MOISTURE IS STILL RATHER PLENTIFUL 
PER 30/00Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS...AND RADAR CONTINUES TO TRACK LIGHT 
SNOW MOVING SE FROM SE KY. THESE ECHOES WILL PASS ACROSS SW VA WHERE 
50 PERCENT POPS COULD BE INCREASED SLIGHTLY FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS. 

MAY MAKE THAT SLIGHT CHANGE IN A LATE EVENING UPDATE. OTHERWISE...
PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOK GOOD...AS DO THE VERY LIGHT SNOW ACCUMS

.AVIATION...CIRCULATION AROUND THE SLOWLY EXITING LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS SPREADING SOME SPOTTY LIGHT PRECIPITATION FROM MIDDLE TN 
TO NEAR CHA VICINTY...WHILE A LARGER AREA OF LIGHT RAIN OR SNOW 
(POSSIBLY BRIEFLY MIXED WITH SLEET) CONTINUES TO TRACK NE OVER MUCH 
OF NE TN AND SW VA. DOUBTFUL IF THIS IS MUCH MORE THAN TRACE TO A 
FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH ACCUMULATION.

THE COLD AIR FLOWING IN AND LINGERING MOISTURE SHOULD SET THE STAGE 
FOR AT LEAST MVFR CONDTIONS OVERNIGHT...WOULD BE IFR FOR SURE IF NOT 
FOR DECENT MIXING FROM SW-W SURFACE AND LOW LEVEL WINDS.

LOOK FOR MUCH IMPROVEMENT DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY WITH CLEARING 
SKIES ALL AREAS BY EARLY AFTERNOON.

PREVIOUS FORECAST DISCUSSION FOLLOWS...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LOW HAS NOW MOVED OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH LIGHT RAIN AND SNOW THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE AREA. DOPPLER RADAR SHOWING COVERAGE SCATTERED IN THE 
VALLEYS WITH A LITTLE MORE COVERAGE IN THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AT THIS 
TIME. WINDS HAVE BEEN MOSTLY SW ACROSS THE NE HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA AND THERE HAVE BEEN SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS. TEMPERATURES 
TODAY HAVE BEEN NEARLY STEADY IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S LOWER 
ELEVATIONS TO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 30S HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE 
PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS. NO SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION HAS OCCURRED AT 
LOWER ELEVATIONS TODAY. ON THE PLATEAU AMOUNTS TO ONE INCH OR SO 
WERE OBSERVED EARLIER TODAY. 

IN THE HIGHER MOUNTAINS ABOVE 3000 FEET...LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS ARE 
LIKELY LATE TODAY AND SHOULD CONTINUE OVERNIGHT. WILL CONTINUE 
SNOWFALL ADVISORY WITH NO CHANGES IN EXPIRATION OR AREA. LOWS 
TONIGHT SHOULD DROP TO NEAR FREEZING IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS WITH 
LITTLE TO NO SNOW ACCUMULATION. ON WEDNESDAY AS UPPER LOW PULLS 
FARTHER AWAY...SKIES WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR IN THE VALLEYS...BUT 
LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE NE AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS FOR A 
FEW HOURS IN THE MORNING. HIGHS WEDNESDAY WILL BE A FEW DEGREES 
WARMER THAN TODAY CENTRAL AND SOUTH...BUT STILL COLD NORTH WITH 
LINGERING CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD... 
AND REVEAL TRANQUIL CONDITIONS AND SEASONABLY MILD TEMPS UNTIL EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT/EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...BUT LIMITED MOISTURE 
WITH THIS FRONT SHOULD PREVENT ANY PRECIP. ANOTHER STRONGER COLD 
FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO MONDAY...BRINGING THE NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN AS A DEEP 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE NATION. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SLOW MOVING UPPER LOW STILL OVER 
MS THIS AFTERNOON. COLDER TEMPERATURES SW OF SURFACE LOW OVER MIDDLE 
AND EAST TN ARE IN THE UPPER 40S...WHILE OUT AHEAD OF THE SURFACE 
LOW WHERE WINDS ARE EAST AND RAINFALL HAS BEEN INTERMITTENT...TEMPS 
ARE STILL IN THE MID 60S. WINDS WILL STILL BE SOMEWHAT STRONG FROM 
THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS NORTH TO VIRGINIA THROUGH MOST OF THE EVENING. 
THE AXIS OF MODERATE RAINFALL...TO POSSIBLY HEAVY RAINFALL...HAS 
SHIFTED TO THE NORTHERN PLATEAU SE TO THE SE TN MOUNTAINS AND SW 
NORTH CAROLINA. RAINFALL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN HEAVIEST OVER SE TN AND 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU DUE TO THE LONG DURATION SE FLOW. THIS AXIS 
WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT EAST OVERNIGHT WITH COLDER SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR 
WORKING IN FROM THE WEST. AFTER A BRIEF BREAK IN PRECIPITATION THE 
ROTATION AROUND THE UPPER LOW WILL INCREASE PRECIPITATION FROM THE 
SW WITH SNOW MIXING IN WITH THE RAIN THEIR FIRST SPREADING INTO THE 
HIGHER MOUNTAINS TUESDAY. WITH GROUND TEMPERATURES WARM FROM TODAY I 
AM NOT EXPECTING ANY SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION VALLEYS BUT AN INCH OR 
SO IS POSSIBLE ON THE HIGHER PLATEAU AREAS AND A COUPLE INCHES IN 
THE HIGHER EASTERN MOUNTAINS BY LATE TUESDAY. LOWS TONIGHT WILL 
STILL BE ABOVE FREEZING BUT HIGHS TOMORROW WILL NOT RISE MUCH AS THE 
COLDER AIR ALOFT MOVES IN WITH UPPER LOW. HIGHS TUESDAY SHOULD STAY 
IN THE 30S MOUNTAINS TO LOWER TO MID 40S ELSEWHERE WITH TEMPERATURES 
DROPPING DURING THE DAY MOST LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...COLDER AIR IS EXPECTED 
TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT...AS THE SLOW-MOVING 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM GRADUALLY MOVES NORTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN APPALACHIANS. MODELS STILL INDICATE SOME LINGERING MOISTURE 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING...WHICH 
SHOULD TRANSITION OVER TO SNOW BEFORE ENDING. WITH A WET AND WARM 
GROUND IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS...DO NOT ANTICIPATE ANY SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS. HOWEVER...SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...GENERALLY ABOVE 2500 FEET. A 
COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON 
FRIDAY...BUT THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE THAT LIMITED MOISTURE 
SHOULD PREVENT ANY PRECIP. THE NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN APPEARS TO BE 
WITH THE NEXT COLD FRONT FOR MONDAY...WITH A GOOD FETCH OF MOISTURE 
FROM THE SOUTHERN JET STREAM POSSIBLY PRODUCING ANOTHER VERY WET 
SCENARIO. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH SUNDAY...BUT WILL THEN TREND WARMER FOR 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WHICH IS IN AGREEMENT WITH THE ECMWF MODEL 
SOLUTION.

445 AM EST MON NOV 28 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SLOW MOVING UPPER LOW WILL TRACK 
INTO OUR AREA DURING THE SHORT TERM...AS SURFACE LOW AND SURFACE 
BOUNDARY FINALLY SHIFTS TO OUR NORTH.  RAIN WILL CONTINUE TODAY 
BEFORE TAPERING OFF SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST TONIGHT.  WILL LEAVE 
FLOOD WATCH AS IS FOR NOW...BUT THINK IT MAY BE ABLE TO END A BIT 
EARLIER THAN ITS CURRENT EXPIRATION.  DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A GOOD SET 
UP FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES...BUT STRONG LOW LEVEL JET CERTAINLY SHOULD 
BRING SOME GUSTY WINDS TO SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. PLAN TO 
TWEAK WIND ADVISORY AREAS AND TIMING...AND WILL CANCEL HIGH WIND 
WATCH.  COLDER AIR WILL MOVE IN TONIGHT...BUT LOOKS LIKE PRECIP WILL 
BE MOSTLY GONE BY THE TIME IT GETS COLD ENOUGH FOR ANY SNOW. WILL 
MENTION POSSIBILITY OF SNOW OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT 
NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF ANY ACCUMULATION EXPECTED THROUGH LATE 
TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MOST OF THE RAIN COMPLIMENTS 
OF THE PLUME OF DEEP MOISTURE WILL HAVE EXITED NORTHEAST OUT OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY 12Z TUESDAY HOWEVER THE BACK EDGE OF THE STRONGER 
LIFT IN THE VICINITY OF THE SURFACE OCCLUDED FRONT MAY STILL BE 
ACROSS A SMALL PART OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA SHORTLY AFTER 12Z. THE 
NEXT FEATURE TO AFFECT THE REGION WILL BE THE DEEP UPPER LOW WHICH 
WILL BE MOVING DIRECTLY OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY ON ITS WAY TOWARD THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES BY 
12Z WEDNESDAY. MODEL FORECASTS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT SHOWING 
AN AREA OF DEEP MOISTURE/LIFT BUILDING BACK INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY 
IN ASSOCIATION WITH A VORT MAX SWINGING FROM THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OF 
ALABAMA EARLY IN THE DAY THROUGH SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BY EARLY 
EVENING. VERY COLD AIR ALOFT UNDER THE UPPER LEVEL LOW SHOULD ALLOW 
FOR RAIN TO CHANGE TO SNOW IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ABOVE 3000 FEET 
DURING THE DAY WITH A RAIN/SNOW MIX ACROSS PARTS OF THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU AS COLD AIR ADVECTION STRENGTHENS FROM THE WEST. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH ABOVE 3000 FEET ELEVATION FOR 
SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION ON TUESDAY TOTALING AROUND ONE INCH. BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME SNOW TO 
MIX WITH THE RAIN IN THE GREAT VALLEY. LIGHT SNOW WILL CONTINUE IN 
THE MOUNTAINS TUESDAY NIGHT WITH ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS AROUND ONE HALF 
TO ONE INCH POSSIBLE AT ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2000 FEET. BY WEDNESDAY THE 
DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE STRONG UPPER LEVEL 
SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING STEADILY NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA 
HOWEVER...THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A LIGHT SNOW/RAIN MIX IN 
THE VALLEY WITH LIGHT MOUNTAIN SNOWFALL THROUGH MID DAY. WAS ABLE TO 
STAY WITH THE DRY FORECAST THROUGH MUCH OF THE REMAINING LONG TERM 
PERIOD. KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS SUNDAY NIGHT AS 
ANOTHER FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACHES THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 
TRENDED TEMPERATURES TOWARD MEX MOS NUMBERS.

INTO TONIGHT AND MONDAY. HAVE ISSUED A WINDY ADVISORY FOR
TODAY...BUT WILL LIKELY HAVE TO EXTEND IT THROUGH MONDAY. IN
ADDITION...BACKING WINDS TO MORE OF A SOUTHEAST COMPONENT FOR
MONDAY AND INCREASED WINDS MAY WARRANT A HIGH WIND WATCH FOR THE
MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS TOMORROW.

DOWNSLOPE WINDS INTO THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO WARM TO NEAR FORECASTED HIGHS...SO HAVE RAISED MAX
FOR TODAY.

CURRENT FLOOD WATCH CONFIGURATION LOOKS GOOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SLOW MOVING UPPER TROUGH WILL 
APPROACH...WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLOWLY MOVING IN TONIGHT.  STRONG 
SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL FEED CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE INTO THE AREA...AND 
WITH THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF RAIN THERE IS A POTENTIAL FOR SOME 
FAIRLY HEAVY RAINFALL AMOUNTS.  WILL ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR ALL BUT 
NORTHEAST COUNTIES FOR LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND THIS WILL EXTEND 
INTO MONDAY.  WINDS ARE ANOTHER CONCERN...AS LOW LEVEL JET WILL BE 
STRONG.  SOME CONCERN FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES...ALTHOUGH WIND DIRECTION 
MAY STAY JUST A BIT TOO SOUTHWEST.  FOR NOW GIVEN UNCERTAINTY WILL 
NOT ISSUE ANY WIND ADVISORIES/WARNINGS...BUT THIS WILL NEED TO BE 
MONITORED.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.   

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN 
DEPICTION OF DEEPENING UPPER LOW MAKING THE JOURNEY FROM THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY NORTHEAST TO MIDDLE TENNESSEE 12Z MONDAY THROUGH 
12Z TUESDAY. DURING THE SAME PERIOD SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL SHIFT 
NORTH FROM NORTHWEST GEORGIA INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. PLUME OF DEEP 
MOISTURE WILL ACCOMPANY THE SYSTEM DURING ITS TREK GENERATING 
WIDESPREAD MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY HEAVY RAIN ACROSS MUCH OF 
SOUTHEAST AND EAST CENTRAL TENNESSEE AS WELL AS SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA WHERE THE FLOOD WATCH CONTINUES UNTIL 00Z TUESDAY. AS DRIER 
AIR WRAPS AROUND THE STORM CIRCULATION...PRECIPITATION SHOULD 
GRADUALLY TAPER OFF FROM SOUTHWEST THROUGH NORTHEAST MONDAY NIGHT. 
POCKET OF COLD AIR ALOFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL LOW SHOULD 
ALLOW FOR THE RAIN TO MIX WITH SNOW AT ELEVATIONS ABOVE 3500 FEET 
MONDAY NIGHT. RAINFALL SHOULD CONTINUE TO DECREASE IN COVERAGE 
ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AS THE UPPER LOW SHIFTS 
SLOWLY NORTHEAST TOWARD THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY. AGAIN...TEMPERATURES 
ALOFT WILL SUPPORT SNOWFALL IN THE MOUNTAINS ON TUESDAY AS THE UPPER 
LOW MOVES SLOWLY NORTHEAST AND SNOW MAY BECOME MIXED WITH THE RAIN 
EVEN IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AS COLD AIR ADVECTION STRENGTHENS FROM 
THE WEST. BY TUESDAY NIGHT THE UPPER LOW WILL HAVE SHIFTED WELL 
NORTHEAST OF THE AREA BUT MODELS AGREE A TRAILING SHORTWAVE WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH KEEPING A CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION GOING 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AND LOW LEVEL THICKNESS WILL CONTINUE 
TO SUPPORT A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW...WITH SNOW BEING THE MAIN 
PRECIP TYPE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA SHOULD BE DRY AND THIS TREND MAY CONTINUE THROUGH 
SATURDAY AS THE MODELS TRY TO BRING ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE 
APPALACHIANS ON FRIDAY BUT MOISTURE WILL BE QUITE LIMITED. TRENDED 
THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST TOWARD THE NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE ESPECIALLY 
LATER IN THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE EXITING THE REGION 
THIS EVENING AS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHES THE AREA.  
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE OVERNIGHT WITH RAIN EXPECTED TO REACH INTO AT 
LEAST FAR WESTERN LOCATIONS BY SUNRISE.  RAIN WILL SPREAD INTO THE 
MRX CWA ON SUNDAY AND WINDS WILL INCREASE AND BECOME BREEZY AS THE 
FRONT APPRAOCHES.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH 
TO MOVE INTO THE EASTERN STATES BY SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WITH 
HEAVY RAINFALL POTENTIAL ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST PART OF THE FORECAST 
AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. THE COLD FRONT WILL SLOW DOWN AS A 
CLOSED UPPER LOW FORMS OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY. AT THE SURFACE 
AHEAD OF THE UPPER LOW A LOWER PRESSURE WILL DEEPEN AND ENHANCE 
RAINFALL ESPECIALLY OVER THE SE TN AND SW NC MOUNTAINS. 48 HOUR 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 3 TO 5 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE BY MONDAY EVENING IN 
THE MOUNTAINS WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER AMOUNTS PLATEAU AND VALLEY AREAS. 
HAVE ISSUED HYDROLOGIC OUTLOOK TO ADDRESS THE POSSIBILITY OF 
FLOODING. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD SUNDAY NIGHT INTO  MONDAY WITH 
STRONG SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST WINDS AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTH ACROSS 
THE MOUNTAINS TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE N OR 
NW MONDAY OR MONDAY NIGHT DEPENDING ON THE SPEED OF THE SYSTEM AND 
TEMPERATURES WILL DROP INTO THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S BY TUESDAY 
MORNING. COLD AIR ADVECTION ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW WILL 
BRING THE RISK OF SNOW TO THE REGION EARLY TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. 
SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE MAINLY TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY AS COLDER AIR MOVES IN. SNOW COULD STICK EVEN IN THE 
VALLEY AREAS BU THE TRACK OF THE LOW AND THE SPEED IT MOVES NORTH OR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER REGION BRINGING 
ANOTHER DRY DAY TODAY. BUT A FRONT AND AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
APPROACHING FROM THE WEST TONIGHT. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR 
TONIGHT AND FOR OUR WESTERN ZONES. SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL 
LIQUID PRECIPITATION. CLOUDS SHOULD MINIMIZE ANY FOG THAT DEVELOPS 
THIS MORNING SO WILL NOT MENTION IN THE FORECAST.  TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD STAY ABOVE NORMAL FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. GUIDANCE 
TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED CLOSE. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ECMWF PROVED TO BE THE BEST 
MODEL FOR USE DURING THE EXTENDED FORECAST FEATURING AN AMPLIFIED 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IN PLACE OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE NATION ON 12Z 
SUNDAY. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL BE A SLOWER MOVER AS AN UPPER 
LEVEL LOW FORMS ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LATER IN THE DAY 
AND SHIFTS SLOWLY SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OF ALABAMA 
BY 12Z MONDAY. THEREFORE...CATEGORICAL OR LIKELY POPS WERE APPLIED 
FOR SHOWERS OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE STRONG DOWNSLOPING MAY KEEP 
RAIN OUT OF THE PICTURE UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT. A STRONG LOW LEVEL JET 
WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND MOUNTAIN 
WAVE CONDITIONS WILL IMPACT THE HIGHER TERRAIN DURING THIS PERIOD. 
STAYED WITH THE RATHER HIGH PROBABILITY OF RAIN THROUGH MONDAY FOR 
MOST OF THE REGION AS DEEPENING UPPER LOW/SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM LUMBER ONLY SLOWLY EAST. THE UPPER FEATURE WILL BE 
ACCOMPANIED BY VERY COLD AIR ALOFT AND SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
MAY SEE SOME SNOW MIX WITH THE RAIN...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS AS IT TRACKS NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
THE STRONG CIRCULATION AROUND THE STORM SYSTEM WILL RESULT IN A 
HEALTHY DOSE OF COLD AIR ADVECTION TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AND 
LIGHT RAIN MAY CHANGE TO LIGHT SNOW ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
WITH EMPHASIS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. SOME SNOW MAY CONTINUE ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON BEFORE ENDING. DRY ADVECTION AND RISING 
HEIGHTS SHOULD FINISH OUT THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD ALLOWING A 
RETURN TO DRY WEATHER THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK.

MATCH THE ECMWF SCENARIO SO DID NOT REALLY USE THE MEX MOS 
NUMBERS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE REGION

CLEAR SKY AND LIGHT WIND...WILL PROBABLY SEE FOG DEVELOPING DURING 
THE MORNING HOURS. BUT DENSE FOG LOCATIONS WILL BE ISOLATED SO WILL 
NOT ISSUE AN ADVISORY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE BACK TO NEAR TO ABOVE 
NORMAL. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED 
RELATIVELY CLOSE. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE 
REVEALING SOME LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN IN THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD BEGINNING SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH THE OTHER ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS ALSO SHOWING LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH THE PATTERN FOR EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO TREND CLOSER TO THE ECMWF SOLUTION 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED...SINCE IT HAS MAINTAINED BETTER CONSISTENCY 
OVER THE PAST SEVERAL MODEL RUNS THAN THE GFS MODEL. A HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE PLAINS 
ON SATURDAY...WHICH WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. ECMWF MODEL CONTINUES TO BE 
AROUND 12 HOURS SLOWER THAN THE GFS MODEL WITH THE EASTWARD 
PROGRESSION OF THIS COLD FRONT...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO TREND TOWARDS 
A COMPROMISE SOLUTION BY MENTIONING A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT. A GOOD FETCH OF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO 
SHOULD HELP TO PRODUCE A FAIRLY WET SCENARIO FOR SUNDAY OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. ECMWF MODEL CONTINUES TO SHOW THE HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BECOMING A CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE DEEP SOUTH ON 
MONDAY...WHILE THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES THAT THIS UPPER 
TROUGH WILL NOT CUT OFF FROM THE NORTHERN STREAM. SINCE THE LATEST 
GFS SOLUTION IS THE FIRST MODEL TO SHOW THIS TYPE OF PATTERN...WILL 
IGNORE THE GFS MODEL BEYOND SUNDAY AND CONTINUE TO TREND TOWARDS THE 
ECMWF SOLUTION OF A WET PERIOD FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE ECMWF 
MODEL ALSO CONTINUES TO REVEAL A WARMER VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...WHICH WOULD SUPPORT MOSTLY 
RAIN UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN COLDER AIR BEHIND ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
BRINGS THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. HOWEVER BY THEN...MOST OF THE MOISTURE WITH THIS UPPER 
LOW SHOULD BE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH SUNDAY. 
FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...WILL TREND WARMER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS...WHICH 
IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ECMWF SOLUTION AND THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

CONTINUE TO DIVERGE WITH TIMING AND PLACEMENT OF AN UPPER LOW

THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS IS SWINGING THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING.
UPSTREAM SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT DRIER AIR ALOFT WILL CONTINUE TO
ADVECT IN THROUGH THE AFTERNOON BEHIND THE TROUGH. 12Z OHX SOUNDING
SHOWS MOISTURE CONFINED BELOW 850 MB...AND MOISTURE DEPTH WILL ONLY
DECREASE THROUGH THE DAY. AS A RESULT...WILL REMOVE THE SLIGHT
CHANCE POP IN NORTHERN AREAS AND THE MOUNTAINS. CLOUDS WILL
EVENTUALLY THIN OUT AS BOTH THE RUC AND NAM SHOW CLEARING LATE IN
THE AFTERNOON...BUT EXPECT THIS TO OCCUR A BIT MORE SLOWLY THAN THE
MODELS SUGGEST. THUS WILL LOWER TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY IN ALL
LOCATIONS. 

THE NEED FOR A WIND ADVISORY WAS CONSIDERED IN SW VA AND THE TN
MOUNTAINS...HOWEVER THERE HAVE BEEN NO OBSERVATIONS IN THE AREA
CLOSE TO ADVISORY CRITERIA...AND MODELS INDICATE DECREASING WINDS
THROUGH THE DAY AS THE SURFACE LOW MOVES FARTHER OFF THE NEW

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR INDICATING THE FRONT AND 
UPPER TROUGH TRIGGERING A NARROW LINE OF LIGHT SHOWERS. MOST OF THE 
ACTIVITY SHOULD END TODAY AS THE TROUGH EXITS THE CWA. SO KEPT 
THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE MORNING HOURS. ALSO EXPECTING DECREASING 
TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES BACK TO NEAR NORMAL. RIDGE BUILDING BACK 
INTO THE REGION PROVIDING A RETURN TO DRY WEATHER TONIGHT. GUIDANCE 
TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE SO DIDN'T STRAY TOO FAR. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT 
SHOW SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE TIMING OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT OVER 
THE WEEKEND. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON THURSDAY...WITH UPPER-LEVEL RIDGING 
LINGERING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION INTO SATURDAY... 
RESULTING IN UNSEASONABLY MILD AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS. A HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE PLAINS 
ON SATURDAY...WHICH WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY ON SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. ECMWF MODEL IS A LITTLE SLOWER 
THAN THE GFS MODEL WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS COLD 
FRONT...AND FOR NOW...WILL TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE SOLUTION WITH 
SHOWERS BEGINNING TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY NIGHT. A 
GOOD FETCH OF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO SHOULD HELP TO 
PRODUCE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE COVERAGE OF SHOWERS ON SUNDAY. THE HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO BECOME A CUT-OFF LOW 
OVER THE SOUTHEAST ON MONDAY...WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA (ESPECIALLY THE NORTHERN 
HALF) ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THIS UPPER LOW WILL ALSO BRING COOLER 
TEMPS ALOFT...WHICH WILL COULD PRODUCE SOME SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS DEPENDING ON WHICH MODEL SOLUTION VERIFIES. ECMWF 
MODEL KEEPS UPPER-LEVEL TEMPS WARM ENOUGH FOR MAINLY RAIN EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...WHILE THE GFS MODELS REVEALS MUCH COLDER AIR ALOFT RESULTING 
IN SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MOST OF THESE MODEL 
DISCREPANCIES ARE THE RESULT OF THEIR SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT TRACKS OF 
THE UPPER LOW FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...AND FOR NOW...WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SNOW SHOWERS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CONDITIONS NOT LOOKING AS 
POTENT OVERALL FOR THIS EVENING.  STILL ENOUGH STRENGTH IN WIND 
FIELD TO GET FAST WINDS TRANSFERRED TO GROUND VIA THUNDERSTORM 
DOWNDRAFTS.  ALSO ENOUGH SHEAR TO HAVE SOME BOWING LINE SEGMENTS.  AS 
CELLS MOVE TO NORTHEAST...THEY WILL RUN INTO LESS AND LESS 
INSTABILITY AND SHOULD POSE LESS OF A THREAT...WITH DOWNDRAFTS 
BECOMING WEAK AS WELL...AND THEREFORE LESS OUTFLOW WINDS.  

STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE TWO WAVES OF PRECIPITATION LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  THIS FIRST WAVE THAT IS PASSING THROUGH THE 
WESTERN AREAS NOW MAY END UP BEING THE MORE INTENSE. BY THE TIME
THE SECOND ONE ARRIVES...WE WILL BE PAST PEAK HEATING...BUT ALSO
THIS AREA HAS BEEN IN RELATIVELY STABLE AIR MOST OF THE DAY...DUE
TO THICK CLOUD COVER.

WENT WITH THUNDER FOR EVENING AND JUST SHOWERS LATE TONIGHT.  MOST 
OF THE PRECIP WILL HAVE EXITED BY DAYBREAK WEDNESDAY.
 
.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...RIDGING SURFACE AND 
ALOFT MOVES EAST ACROSS THE AREA SATURDAY. COOL NIGHTS WITH WARM 
DAYS AND DRY CONDITIONS. BACKED OFF ON PRECIPITATION FOR SATURDAY. 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE LOWERS DRAMATICALLY FROM SUNDAY INTO NEXT WEEK. 
A SHARP HIGH AMPLITUDE TROUGH IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP THROUGH THE 
NATIONS MIDSECTION. STRENGTH AND LOCATION REMAINS UNCERTAIN. A 
DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL LIKELY CUT OFF FROM THE NORTHERN 
STREAM AND LINGER IN THE MID SOUTH OR TENNESSEE VALLEY WELL INTO 
NEXT WEEK. UPPER TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR 
SOME MIXED PRECIPITATION EARLY NEXT WEEK. AT THIS TIME THE FREEZING 
LEVEL APPEARS TO REMAIN AT OR ABOVE 2800 FEET. FORECAST ADJUSTMENT 
CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THESE LATER PERIODS.

INITIAL SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO AREA. AIR
MASS NOT VERY UNSTABLE AT THIS POINT. GENERALLY, HAVE SHOWERS AND
STORMS TRANSITIONING OVER TO STABLE LIGHT RAIN AND FOG LATE
TONIGHT. WOULD NORMALLY THINK OF KEEPING FOG IN AFTER PRECIP
ENDS...AND OFTENTIMES MAKE THE FOG THICKER...HOWEVER THIS TIME
FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL START TO STIR LOWER LEVELS UP...SO MIX OUT THE
FOG EARLIER THAN USUAL. AT END OF PERIOD...AM BREAKING UP CEILING

INSTABILITY AXIS WELL AHEAD OF FRONT WITH WEAK CONVECTION FIRING IN
IT THIS MORNING...STARTING IN WEST TN...NOW INTO MIDDLE TN. LOOKING
LIKE WE MAY HAVE TWO ROUNDS OF MODERATE STORMS...WITH INITIAL
STORMS MOVING TOWARD AREA NOW...THEN STORMS ALONG THE FRONT
LATER...RATHER THAN ONE INTENSE ROUND.

NOT EXPECTING MUCH INSTABILITY TO BUILD INTO AREA...SHEAR WILL BE
INCREASING...BUT MAIN SHEAR WILL MOVE TO THE NORTH. SPC
PARAMETERS...SCP STP SIGSVR ALL SHOW SOME SIGNS OF LIFE IN THE
MODELS...BUT ARE GENERALLY DEPENDING ON SHEAR VALUES. CAPES
GENERALLY EXPECTED TO STAY <=500 J/KG THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE
AREA...SO DEFINITELY LOW-TOPPED CONVECTION...AND WOULD THINK SEVERE
THREAT IS MAINLY FROM WIND. CAN'T RULE OUT A BRIEF WEAK TORNADO
SPIN-UP...BUT WOULD THINK MAINLY FAST WINDS ALOFT BROUGHT TO GROUND
IN RAIN CORE DOWNDRAFT...WHICH THEN TRANSLATES TO DAMAGING OUTFLOW
WIND WILL BE MAIN THREAT. BETTER THREATS SOUTH-THROUGH WEST-THROUGH
NORTHWEST PARTS OF CWA.

JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKING TO GRIDS WITH DEW POINTS AND CURRENT TEMPS
RUNNING A LITTLE BEHIND. DID NOT ADJUST HIGH TEMP FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER CENTRAL ARKANSAS...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT EXTENDING NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY. AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED STRONG TO SEVERE CONVECTION 
OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH ONLY PATCHY DRIZZLE OVER THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE PROGRESSION 
OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND INDICATE THAT 
THE CENTER OF THE LOW WILL MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY...WHILE ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY. MODELS AGREE THAT MOST OF THE CONVECTION AHEAD OF THIS COLD 
FRONT WILL STAY WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL MID TO LATE 
AFTERNOON. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A STRONG VEERING VERTICAL WIND 
PROFILE DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 18 AND 00Z...WITH 
STRONG 0-1 KM HELICITY VALUES (AROUND 300-400 M2/S2) SUPPORTIVE OF 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED TORNADOES. THE MAIN POSSIBLE LIMITING 
FACTOR FOR SEVERE TSTORMS OVER THE FORECAST AREA INVOLVES THE AMOUNT 
OF INSTABILITY. NAM AND GFS MODELS STILL SHOW SOME DISAGREEMENTS 
WITH THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT THE STRONG WIND DYNAMICS EXPECTED 
WITH THIS FRONT SHOULD HELP TO SUSTAIN AN EASTBOUND SQUALL LINE OF 
STRONG TO SEVERE TSTORMS ORIGINATING FROM MIDDLE TN. WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL 
IN THE ZONE FORECASTS...AND WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION THESE THREATS 
(AS WELL AS POSSIBLE ISOLATED TORNADOES) IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER 
OUTLOOK. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER TROUGH BEHIND THE 
FRONT IS EXPECTED TO TRACK THROUGH THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY. WILL 
KEEP THE CHANCE POPS GOING WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  
RIDGE BUILDS IN BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. A 
FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON LATE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY...WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING FOR BOTH PERIODS. UPPER LOW FOLLOWS ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT AND MONDAY...CONTINUING THE CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION. COOLER 
AIR PUSHING IN BEHIND THE FRONT COULD CAUSE RAIN TO CHANGE TO SNOW 
ON SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
CURRENTLY IMPACTING MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL SHIFT SLOWLY 
NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE AREA TONIGHT WITH ADDITIONAL RIPPLES WAVING 
ALONG THE OHIO VALLEY FRONTAL BOUNDARY. TRIED TO STAY WITH THE MODEL 
TREND WHICH INDICATES REDUCED PROBABILITY FOR RAIN ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AS THE DEEPENING 
SOUTHWESTERN U.S. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SHIFTS NORTHEAST TOWARD THE 
MISSISSIPPI AND LOWER OHIO VALLEY. KEPT LIKELY POPS NEAR THE 
KENTUCKY BORDER WHERE DEEPER MOISTURE IS PROGGED. THE STRONG STORM 
SYSTEM WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL SHIFT INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY DURING THE DAY PULLING A WELL DEFINED COLD FRONT TOWARD THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. INSTABILITY WILL BE MARGINAL AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT BUT BULK SHEAR SHOULD POP INTO THE 40 TO 50 KT RANGE WHICH MAY 
HELP TO GENERATE A LINE OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS. TRIED TO 
KEEP POPS RATHER LOW DURING THE DAY TUESDAY AS PREFERRED NAM MODEL 
INDICATES A SLOWER EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF FRONTAL SYSTEM. 
DOWNSLOPING ACROSS EAST CENTRAL AND NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE MAY EVEN 
ALLOW FOR A FEW PEAKS OF SUNSHINE DURING THE DAY. STAYED WITH 
CATEGORICAL POPS FOR THE BIG FROPA TUESDAY NIGHT. BY WEDNESDAY 
MODELS STILL SHOW SOME TRAILING MOISTURE AND LIFT IN THE BACK SIDE 
OF DEEP EASTERN STATES TROUGH SO KEPT A HIGH CHANCE THROUGH SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP GOING FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH MOST OF THE REGION DRY BY AFTERNOON. STAYED CLOSER TO 
MIDLER MIN TEMPS UNDER BLANKET OF CLOUDS AND MILD DEWPOINTS TONIGHT 
AND WENT CLOSER TO WARMER MAX TEMPS ON TUESDAY AS STRONG SOUTHERLY 
FLOW KICKS IN AHEAD OF LATE DAY/EVENING ARRIVING COLD FRONT. STAYED 
PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.    

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...RIDGING SURFACE AND 
ALOFT PRODUCING MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND A WARMING TREND THROUGH

OF THE UPPER TROUGH WITH CONFIDENCE LOW TOWARDS THE END OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. HAVE LEANED TOWARD A ECMWF SOLUTION. SCATTERED 
CONVECTION BECOMES POSSIBLE SATURDAY WITH INCREASED MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY. A VIGOROUS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
AREA ON SUNDAY. WIDESPREAD CONVECTION CAN BE EXPECTED WITH THIS 
SYSTEM THOU TIMING IS STILL VERY MUCH IN QUESTION. THICKNESS VALUES 
FALL HARD BEHIND THE FRONT. PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY CHANGE TO SNOW 
BEHIND THE FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW NORMAL EARLY NEXT WEEK.

NORTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS LATE TUESDAY AND 
TUESDAY NIGHT. ASSOCIATED JET WILL PLACE THE FORECAST AREA UNDER 
MODERATELY STRONG DIVERGENCE ALOFT. DECENT AGEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION 
WILL HELP MAINTAIN FRONTOGENETIC FORCING ALONG A FRONT THAT MOVES 
THROUGH THE AREA LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. MODELS SHOW CAPES OF 
300-500 J/KG WHICH WILL BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY. STRONG BOUNDARY-MID 
LEVEL WINDS TO PRODUCE A THREAT OF DAMAGING WINDS ALONG THE LINE OF 
CONVECTION WITH THE MAIN CONCERN ALONG AND WEST AND SOUTH OF 
INTERSTATE 40.

SYSTEM EXITS THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY WITH RIDING SURFACE AND ALOFT 
PRODUCING MOSTLY CLEAR SKY FOR THURSDAY AND FIRST HALF OF FRIDAY. 
ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA AT THE END OF THE 
EXTENDED. MODELS ARE IN DISAGREEMENT IN THE STRENGTH AND LOCATION OF 
THE UPPER TROUGH WITH CONFIDENCE LOW. WILL CALL FOR INCREASING 
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ALONG AND AHEAD OF A 
COLD FRONT. FAIRLY CHILLY AIR BEHIND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. GENERALLY 
WENT COLDER THAN MEX MOS GUIDANCE FOR SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS
HAVE REACHED WRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA AT MID AFTERNOON...
WITH ZERO LIGHTNING STRIKES. OPTED FOR SCATTERED COVERAGE OF 
SHOWERS INTO THE EVENING...AND THEN FOR CONTINUITY KEPT A NARROW
BAND OF LIKELY POPS OVER NRN MOST AREA OVERNIGHT. EVENING SHIFT CAN
ADJUST THESE POPS DOWN IF NEEDED...BUT THERE SHOULD BE CONTINUED
DEVELOPMENT OVER KY JUST SE OF THE COLD FRONT. DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE
RISEN WELL INTO THE 50S...AND MOS HAS HAD A COOL BIAS FOR MIN TEMPS
LATELY. THUS...I STAYED AT LEAST A FEW DEGREES ABOVE THE COOLER GFS
MOS MINS...GOING WITH OR JUST ABOVE NAM MOS MINS.

MONDAY...HIGHER NAM MOS POPS ARE OKAY IF THERE IS INDEED MORE
SHORTWAVE ENERGY EMBEDDED INTO THE W-SW FLOW ALOFT. THE ACTUAL
FRONT WILL AT LEAST JUSTIFY HIGH POPS FOR NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA/NE
TN AREAS. I SEE A POTENTIAL LULL IN CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION FOR
MONDAY NIGHT...AS FRONT LIFTS NORTH INTO THE SRN OHIO VALLEY. 

FOR TUESDAY...SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS ON COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST...SO
EXPECT CONVECTION TO BE DEVELOPING AND APPROACHING FROM THE WEST BY
THE AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO THE MORE SIGNIFICANT RAINS AND
BETTER CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS...ESPECIALLY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT.

FOR TEMPS...OTHER THAN ADJUSTMENTS ON MINS...MOS MAX TEMPS WERE
CLOSE OVERALL AND FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LIKELY POPS WERE
APPLIED TO THE FORECAST ON TUESDAY NIGHT AS SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY
THUNDERSTORMS PROGRESS EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IN
ASSOCIATION WITH OHIO VALLEY MID LATITUDE CYCLONE. THE FEATURE
EXITS THROUGH NEW ENGLAND DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY BUT SOME
TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE KEEP GENERALLY
SMALL POPS FOR SHOWERS GOING MAINLY DURING THE MORNING. A NICE DRY
PERIOD FOLLOWS WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AS AN AMPLIFIED
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE MAKES ITS WAY SLOWLY EAST FROM THE ROCKIES TO THE
EAST COAST. DEEP UPPER TROUGH ARRIVES IN THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
LATER IN THE DAY SATURDAY WITH A SMALL CHANCE FOR SHOWERS SATURDAY
WITH INCREASING PROBABILITY OF RAIN SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AS
THE STRONG STORM SYSTEM PRESSES SLOWLY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. STAYED
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO
WARMER THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CLOUDS SLUGGISH TO BREAK
UP OVER SW NC...BUT TEMPS HAVE WARMED TO OR ABOVE WARMER MOS HIGHS
THIS AFTERNOON. DEW POINT TEMPS ALSO ON THE RISE MORE SO THAN
GUIDANCE...SO WE SHOULD SEE A MUCH MILDER NIGHT AS CLOUDS ALSO
DEVELOP AGAIN TONIGHT. THUS...I WENT A FEW DEGREES ABOVE THE COOLER
GFS MOS MINS AND MORE IN LINE WITH NAM MOS.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY SEEMS TO SAG SOUTH BY SUNDAY EVENING...BUT UNTIL
THEN OUR PREVIOUS CHANCE POPS NORTH TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTH
LOOKED RIGHT ON TRACK. I KEPT THE LOW END OF LIKELY POPS FOR SUNDAY
NIGHT OVER NRN AREAS...TAPERING DOWN TO CHANCE TO THE SOUTH...WHICH
BLENDS BETTER WITH NWS GRIDS OVER NRN GA AND WRN NC. FRONT WOULD
APPEAR TO STAY NORTH OR EVEN LIFT NORTH OUT OF THE AREA ON MONDAY
...SO I KEPT POPS IN CHANCE CATEGORY FOR NOW. 

OTHERWISE...MOS MINS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT WERE CLOSE AND FOLLOWED WITH
AN EVEN MILDER NIGHT IN STORE AS SW FLOW STRENGTHENS. NUDGED HIGHS
UP TO MID 60S TO LOWER 70S ON MONDAY...GIVEN THE LESS CHANCE OF
SHOWERS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE PERIOD BEGINS WITH 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY RIPPING RAPIDLY NORTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
WITH STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF A DEEPENING PLAINS STATES 
TROUGH. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE ADVANCING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH IN 
THIS REGIME WITH SHOWERS LIFTING NORTHWARD ACROSS THE VIEWING AREA 
THROUGH THE NIGHT. ADJUSTED THE POPS FROM MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE DAY TUESDAY AS THE UPPER TROUGH 
AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFT EAST ACROSS THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS. LIKELY POPS FOR 
CONVECTION LOOK GOOD FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...DECREASING FROM THE WEST 
AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT BUILDS THROUGH THE AREA. HELD ONTO 
SOME POST-FRONTAL SHOWERS FOR WEDNESDAY AS TRAILING MOISTURE/ENERGY 
EXIT DURING THE DAY. RIDGING MOVES IN BEHIND THE MID WEEK SYSTEM 
WITH DRY ADVECTION TO KEEP WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MUCH OF SATURDAY 
DRY. A DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AND INTRODUCED SOME SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR SHOWERS ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU SATURDAY...AND THE ENTIRE

.DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED ALONG THE MID ATLANTIC
AND SOUTHEAST COASTS THIS EVENING. SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLEAR WITH
HIGH CLOUDS BEGINNING TO INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST AS UPPER FLOW
BECOMES MORE SOUTHWESTERLY. LOW PRESSURE WAS FORMING ACROSS THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES TONIGHT AND SOUTH WINDS WERE
BEGINNING TO BRING MOISTURE IN THE FORM OF HIGHER DEW POINTS TO THE
WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. LOWS SHOULD BE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER
THAN THIS MORNING ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST SECTIONS AND HIGHER EXPOSED
SITES AS SOUTHWEST WINDS ALOFT INCREASE. UPDATED HOURLY
TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINTS OTHERWISE NO OTHER CHANGES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE RIDGE HAS ALREADY
SHIFTED EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON...WITH SOME OF THE
HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS ALREADY EXPERIENCING SE WINDS. THESE WINDS
SHOULD DIMINISH THIS EVENING AND I EXPECT MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS
OTHER THAN SRN VALLEY...TO SEE WINDS FALL OFF TO NEAR CALM. LOW
CLOUDS MAY ADVECT INTO SE TN AND POSSIBLY SW NC BEFORE DAYBREAK...
AS RH INCREASES ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE 850 MB RIDGE. THUS...I KEPT
MOST LOWS IN THE 20S AGAIN TONIGHT...EXCEPT FOR A FEW AREAS IN THE
LOWER 30S WHERE THESE CLOUDS AND LIGHT SE WINDS MAY BE A FACTOR.

SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY GRIDS APPEARED TO BE ON TRACK...AS RIDGING
GRADUALLY GIVES WAY TO A CHANCE OF SHOWERS...MAINLY ON SUNDAY. KEPT
POPS BELOW LIKELY EVEN FOR NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES FOR NOW...UNTIL THE
FRONT DRAWS A BIT CLOSER BY SUNDAY NIGHT. MOS TEMPS CLOSE TO OUR
PREVIOUS GRIDS AND JUST TWEAKED SLIGHTLY IN LINE WITH 18/12Z GFSX
MOS AND NEIGHBORS GRIDS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS 
ALOFT SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
WITH SEVERAL SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES RIDING ACROSS THE REGION 
DURING THIS TIMEFRAME. A SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL DROP SLOWLY 
SOUTH INTO THE AREA KEEPING A DECENT CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE FORECAST. 
PERHAPS THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
TUESDAY NIGHT AS A MORE AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED 
SURFACE WAVE RIDE ALONG THE BOUNDARY. THE UPPER FEATURE EXITS 
QUICKLY DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY BUT KEPT A SMALL CHANCE FOR WRAP 
AROUND SHOWERS GOING WITH EMPHASIS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AS 
OROGRAPHICALLY FAVORED NORTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS. REMAINDER OF THE 
FORECAST INCLUDES DRY ADVECTION WITH BUILDING HEIGHTS. TWEAKED 
TEMPERATURE FORECAST CLOSE TO...BUT NOT QUITE AS MILD...AS THE NEW 
MEX MOS GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A CHILLY AFTERNOON BUT 
WEATHER HAS IMPROVED AS DRIER AND MUCH COOLER AIR CONTINUES TO FLOW 
INTO THE REGION. COLD AIR ADVECTION IS CREATING A STEEP LAPSE RATE
AND HAS ALLOWED SOME CUMULUS/STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS TO DEVELOP FROM SE 
KY ACROSS SW VA/NE TN. THESE CLOUDS WILL DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET...
FOLLOWED BY CLEAR SKIES AND DECREASING WINDS AS SURFACE RIDGE
SETTLES OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY DAYBREAK FRIDAY. THE
COOLER MOS MINS LOOKED VERY REASONABLE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED.

OTHERWISE...A DRY PERIOD IS EXPECTED RIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY. WILL 
IGNORE THE NAM MOS POPS FOR SATURDAY...BUT ALLOW A SLIGHT INCREASE 
IN CLOUDS BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON AS SW FLOW STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF THE 
NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM. SURFACE HIGH LOOKS TO BE ANCHORED ENOUGH TO 
KEEP WINDS LIGHT AND VARIABLE FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...SO VALLEY WINDS 
SHOULD STAY LIGHT NE RATHER THAN SWITCH TO SW (UP VALLEY) FLOW. THIS 
SHOULD FAVOR THE 12Z MOS MINS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...WHICH WERE A FEW TO 
SEVERAL DEGREES COOLER THAN PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID. MOS HIGHS CLOSE 
AND FOLLOWED FOR FRIDAY...BUT NAM MOS HIGHS LOOKED TOO COOL FOR 
SATURDAY. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE REGION PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR SATURDAY NIGHT. A FRONT TRACKS

COLD FRONT HAS NOW MOVED INTO THE CAROLINAS WITH UPPER TROUGH
ABOUT TO MOVE INTO THE TN VALLEY. SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING AROUND
TROUGH IS SETTING OFF SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE NW HALF OF
THE FORECAST AREA AT THIS TIME. TEMPERATURES ARE MUCH WARMER THAN
ORIGINALLY FORECAST MOSTLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S WITH A FEW
LOCATIONS IN SW VA IN THE UPPER 30S. WIND SPEEDS HAVE INCREASED
DURING THE PAST HOUR OR SO AND DEW POINTS HAVE BEGUN TO DROP AS
COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT HAS INCREASED. THE CURRENT
SHOWERS SHOULD MOVE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA IN ABOUT 6 HOURS BUT
THERE MAY BE A FEW SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. REDUCED
SNOWFALL TOTAL TO A COUPLE TENTHS BUT EVEN THAT MIGHT BE TOO MUCH.
WITH CURRENT GROUND WARMTH NOT EXPECTING ANY REAL ACCUMULATION
BEFORE PRECIPITATION ENDS. CLOUDS SHOULD DECREASE LATE THIS MORNING
OR EARLY AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES NOT EXPECTED TO RISE MUCH FROM
MORNING LOWS AND MAY ACTUALLY FALL DURING THE AFTERNOON AS COLD AIR
ADVECTION CONTINUES. TONIGHTS LOW LOOK TO BE ABOUT THE COLDEST SO
FAR THIS SEASON WITH LOW TO MID 20S LOWER ELEVATIONS NORTH AND
CENTRAL TO UPPER 20S SOUTH. WINDS WILL LIKELY STAY UP THROUGH THE
EVENING WITH GOOD PRESSURE GRADIENT THEN DECREASE LATER TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION PROVIDING DRY WEATHER AND COOL
TEMPERATURES THROUGH SATURDAY. WARM UP BEGINS SATURDAY NIGHT AS
RIDGE SLIDES EAST AND LAYER FLOW BECOMES INCREASING SW. WEST TO
EAST FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIDES SE AND INTO THE AREA ON MONDAY.
PRECIPITATION CHANCE RETURNS LATER SUNDAY AND LOOKS GOOD FOR
MONDAY. RAIN CHANCE CONTINUES INTO TUESDAY AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY
RETURNS NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. BEST PRECIPITATION CHANCE ON
WEDNESDAY AND COLD FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE EAST THROUGH THE AREA.
TIMING IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD SUBJECT TO CHANGE PENDING TRACK
POSITION OF UPPER LOW EJECTING FROM MEXICO EARLY NEXT WEEK. LEANED

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT
LIES ALONG THE NORTHERN BORDER OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH AN
EXPANDING AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS WESTERN KY AND
TN PRODUCING MODERATE TO HEAVY RAINFALL. OTHER SHOWERS AND EMBEDDED
THUNDERSTORMS WERE DEVELOPING OVER WEST CENTRAL AL MOVING NE.
CURRENT MODELS SHOW LOW PRESSURE MOVING NE FROM THE TEXAS/LOUISIANA
REGION ALONG THE FRONT WITH IT BEGINNING TO MOVE EAST. SHORTWAVE
ENERGY AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL PRODUCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
SOME POSSIBLY STRONG WITH HEAVY RAINFALL AT TIMES THIS MORNING AND
AFTERNOON. BEHIND THE FRONT SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING AND
THEN DECREASE LATE THIS EVENING OR EARLY MORNING. FREEZING LEVELS
WILL DROP BY EARLY MORNING BUT STAY HIGH ENOUGH THAT PRECIPITATION
SHOULD BE MOSTLY RAIN. CAN NOT RULE OUT A LITTLE SNOW HIGHEST
ELEVATIONS BUT HAVE NOT INCLUDED SINCE AIR MASS WILL HAVE DRIED OUT
BY THURSDAY MORNING. RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF ONE TO TWO INCHES WILL BE
COMMON WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS. DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE ANY
FLOODING WITH RIVERS LOW AND NO SIGNIFICANT HEAVY RAINS THE PAST
TWO WEEKS OR SO. BEST INSTABILITY WILL BE THIS MORNING THEN
DECREASING WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE THIS AFTERNOON. BEST CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS FROM ABOUT 09 TO 21Z. TEMPERATURES STILL MILD THIS
MORNING IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MET
GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS. LOWS TONIGHT MOSTLY LOWER 40S BUT UPPER 30S
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HIGHER MOUNTAINS MAY REACH LOWER TO MID 30S. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...ADVECTION OF COLD DRY
AIR WILL BEGIN IN EARNEST THURSDAY MORNING...BRINGING A QUICK END
TO ANY PRECIP CHANCES. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE QUICKLY SETTLES OVER
THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT...AND TEMPS WILL BE BELOW FREEZING AREA
WIDE. CLEAR SKIES WILL PREVAIL THROUGH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS THE
RIDGE MOVES EAST AND THE AIR MASS BEGINS TO MODERATE EACH DAY.

A RETURN FLOW OF MOISTURE ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE ATLANTIC RIDGE 
WILL ARRIVE ON SUNDAY. THE GFS AND ECMWF HAVE BEEN IN REASONABLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT IN DEPICTING A FRONT STALLING AROUND THE OHIO VALLEY 
REGION. A MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL PERSIST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY 
SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...AND WITH A NEARLY ZONAL UPPER LEVEL FLOW.
LOWER FORECAST CONFIDENCE NEAR END OF PERIOD AS ANOTHER UPPER LOW

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
GENERALLY ALONG A MEMPHIS TO NASHVILLE TO PIKEVILLE KY LINE...WITH A 
VERY MOIST AND UNSEASONABLY WARM AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS OCCURRING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH STRONG TSTORMS OVER THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE. THIS SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY TOWARDS SUNRISE. WHILE THIS SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO 
WEAKEN OVERNIGHT...IT SHOULD HELP TO DESTABILIZE THE AIR MASS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA...LEADING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME TSTORMS 
TOWARDS SUNRISE. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE VERTICAL WIND FIELD WILL 
STRENGTHEN SOME OVERNIGHT...SO THINK THAT SOME STRONG TSTORMS WITH 
GUSTY WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE TOWARDS 
SUNRISE.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE 
THIS EVENING TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
LARGE SCALE QG FORCING WILL INCREASE TUESDAY NIGHT AS A SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH THAT LIFTS NE OUT OF TX/LA. STRONG MOISTURE 
ADVECTION AND GOOD UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE JET ENTRANCE REGION WILL 
RESULT IN CATEGORICAL POPS AND QPF EXCEEDING 1 INCH TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. THERE WILL ALSO BE SOME INSTABILITY 
PRESENT TO WARRANT A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. WHILE PRECIP MAY BE 
LOCALLY HEAVY AT TIMES...DRY ANTECEDENT CONDITIONS AND THE WEAKENING 
TREND OF THE SYSTEM AS IT APPROACHES DIMINISH THE NEED FOR A FLOOD 
WATCH AT THIS TIME. THE 850 MB TROUGH AXIS MOVES THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON...THEN STRONG DRY ADVECTION ALOFT SHOULD END ALL PRECIP 
CHANCES WEDNESDAY EVENING. THE COLD AIR LAGGING BEHIND THE DRYING 
SHOULD PREVENT ANY CHANGE TO FROZEN PRECIP WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

COLD ADVECTION THURSDAY WILL RESULT IN HIGH TEMPS IN THE 50S IN MOST 
SPOTS...WITH LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT IN THE 20S TO LOWER 30S AND CLEAR 
SKIES. THE WEEKEND WILL BRING A NICE WARMING TREND AS THE ATLANTIC 
RIDGE BECOMES DOMINANT AND PROVIDES A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY 
FLOW...WITH HIGHS WELL INTO THE 60S AGAIN. ON SUNDAY THE 12Z GFS 
SHOWS A LOW TRACKING ACROSS THE UPPER MS VALLEY TO THE UPPER GREAT 
LAKES WITH A FRONT TRAILING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND STALLING. THE 
UPPER JET ALSO BECOMES POSITIONED OVER THE REGION SUNDAY AND MONDAY. 
THE ECMWF SHOWS A FAIRLY SIMILAR PATTERN...AND THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WHICH WAS PRODUCING A DEEP 
SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND UNSEASONABLY WARM 
TEMPS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE LOWER MS AND TN RIVER 
VALLEYS...WHICH WILL LIKELY COVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS. THESE HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD HELP TO KEEP TEMPS WARMER 
TONIGHT (COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT)...AND SHOULD ALSO PREVENT ANY FOG 
FORMATION TOWARDS SUNRISE.

CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR THE MOST PART...BUT WILL 
PLAN TO UPDATE THIS EVENING TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE 
LATEST TRENDS.

.AVIATION...MOST OF THE ACTIVE WEATHER WILL REMAIN NORTHWEST OF THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AS A PROTECTIVE RIDGE MAINTAINS
POSITION OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO/SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC STATES. QUITE A
BIT OF CI AND AC TO STREAM ACROSS THE TERMINALS AS FAST FLOW
CONTINUES BETWEEN SOUTHEASTERN RIDGE AND NORTH CENTRAL THROUGH
SOUTHWESTERN U.S. TROUGH. THE QUESTION IS HOW MUCH LOW LEVEL
MOISTENING WILL OCCUR DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE FORECAST PERIOD
AS A SHORT WAVE FEATURE BUILDS NORTHEAST FROM THE WESTERN PLAINS
INTO THE GREAT LAKES. MODEL TIME HEIGHT INDICATE QUITE A BIT OF LOW
CLOUD (MVFR CEILINGS) FORMING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AROUND
08-16Z MONDAY. APPLIED AN MVFR CEILING AT CHA AROUND 11-15Z AS LOW
LEVELS MOISTEN OUT AHEAD OF THE MIDWEST SHORT WAVE BUT AM SKEPTICAL
ABOUT THE POSSIBILITY OF MVFR CEILINGS DEVELOPING FARTHER NORTH AT
TYS AND TRI SO KEPT OUT OF THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME. MODELS TRY TO
DEVELOP SOME LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS SOUTHEAST THROUGH CENTRAL EAST
TENNESSEE ON MONDAY BUT PROBABILITY SO LOW DID NOT MENTION IN THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN TO 
OUR EAST AND SLOW MOVING FRONTAL SYSTEM TO OUR WEST DURING THE SHORT 
TERM PERIOD.  SOUTHWESTERLY LOW LEVEL JET WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE 
MOISTURE...WITH LOW CLOUDS MOVING IN TONIGHT.  APPEARS MOISTURE WILL 
REMAIN RATHER SHALLOW AND LIFT LIMITED AT BEST...SO DO NOT EXPECT 
MUCH MORE THAN SOME VERY LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE WHICH MAY HAVE A HARD 
TIME REACHING MEASURABLE AMOUNTS...BUT HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING LOW 
POPS SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR MONDAY ALL ZONES. NOT 
MUCH ARGUMENT WITH MAV TEMPS.  OBSERVATIONS INDICATE WINDS HAVE BEEN 
BELOW WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA...SO PLAN TO DROP THE ADVISORY A COUPLE 
OF HOURS EARLY FOR THE PLATEAU. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
CONTINUE TO EXHIBIT POOR RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY AND DUBIOUS MODEL 
AGREEMENT WITH APPROACHING SYSTEM. AS A RESULT...TIMING OF ONSET AND 
DEPARTURE OF ASSOCIATED PRECIP REMAINS UNCERTAIN. MOST MODELS HAVE 
SLOWED DOWN PROGRESSION OF FRONT WITH FROPA THROUGH OUR FORECAST 
AREA PROJECTED TO OCCUR SOMETIME EARLY WEDNESDAY. APPEARS PRECIP 
WILL LINGER THROUGH WEDNESDAY AND HAVE SLIGHTLY INCREASED POPS FOR 
THAT PERIOD. BALANCE OF LONG TERM CONTINUES TO LOOK DRY AT THIS 
TIME. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX 
GUIDANCE... ALTHOUGH MODEL UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO FRONTAL 
PROGRESSION LOWERS CONFIDENCE IN THOSE ALSO.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE REGION WILL DRIFT EAST.   DRY AIR WILL REMAIN OVER THE 
AREA...WITH A CLEAR SKY TONIGHT AND JUST AN INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS 
SATURDAY. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE FOR THE SHORT
TERM...SO JUST A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN FORECAST ISSUE FOR 
THE LONG TERM CONTINUES TO BE NEXT SYSTEM WHICH APPROACHES THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY EARLY NEXT WORK WEEK. MODELS COMING 
INTO SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT...BUT THERE ARE STILL SOME 
DIFFERENCES NOTED IN THE TIMING OF DEPARTURE OF THIS EVENT. DUE TO 
THE UNCERTAINTY...HAVE AGAIN NOT MADE ANY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO 
PRECEDING FORECAST. BALANCE OF LONG TERM APPEARS GENERALLY DRY AT 
THIS TIME. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX

CEILING POSSIBLE AT TRI BUT SHOULD STAY ABOVE 3000 FEET (VFR). 
WINDS MAY STAY UP A BIT THIS EVENING AT TAF SITES...AROUND 10 TO 15

OTHERWISE...VFR CONDITIONS FOR MOST OF THIS TAF PACKAGE AS HIGH

UPCOMING WEEKEND AS RETURN FLOW AROUND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE SOUTHEAST COMMENCES AND HEIGHTS RISE IN RESPONSE TO WEAK UPPER 
RIDGING BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. NEXT SYSTEM

.AVIATION...COLD FRONT MOVING STEADILY EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY WITH 
AT LEAST SCATTERED -SHRA TO AFFECT MAINLY TYS AND TRI FOR THE NEXT 2 
TO 5 HOURS. POOR CONDITIONS AT CHA (MVFR TO IFR) SHOULD IMPROVE 
SHORTLY WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE. TYS WILL EXPERIENCE MVFR OR LOWER FOR 
ANOTHER 1 TO 3 HOURS THEN ALSO IMPROVE WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE.  

CONDITIONS WILL BE TRENDING DOWNWARD AT TRI AS RAIN HAS FINALLY 
REACHED THE SURFACE...BUT PROBABLY NO LOWER THAN MVFR.

SECOND HALF OF THIS TAF PACKAGE WILL SEE VFR CONDITIONS DOMINATE 
WITH SOME BREEZY W-NW SURFACE WINDS ON THURSDAY. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSIONS FOLLOW...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP THROUGH 
THIS EVENING.  MOISTURE LIMITED AND SO WILL JUST SEE SOME MAINLY 
LIGHT SHOWERS.  WILL CARRY NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE POPS TONIGHT.  
COLDER AIR WILL PUSH IN LATER TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...AND UPPER 
TROUGH WILL SWING ACROSS THE AREA.  MODEL SOUNDINGS LOOK RATHER 
UNFAVORABLE FOR ANY UPSLOPE SHOWERS/SNOW SHOWERS LATE TONIGHT AND 
THURSDAY...SO WILL CARRY NO MORE THAN SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF NORTH AND MOUNTAINS THU MORNING.  MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR 
SOME SNOW SHOWERS HIGHEST TERRAIN LATE TONIGHT/EARLY THU.  NOT MUCH 
ARGUMENT WITH MAV TEMPS SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH
FOLLOWING TONIGHTS SURFACE FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
THURSDAY NIGHT. A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY
INTO THE MIDDLE APPALACHIANS AND SPREAD SOME CLOUD COVER TO
NORTHEAST SECTIONS OVERNIGHT BUT NO PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED.
OTHERWISE SKIES WILL BE CLEAR SE TO PARTLY CLOUDY NE. LOWS SHOULD
BE THE COLDEST OF THE YEAR EXCEPT ACROSS THE NE WHERE SOME WINDS
AND CLOUDS WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 20S TO NEAR 30.
AREAS NEAR TRI AND SW NC VALLEYS SHOULD DROP TO THE MID 20S AND
HIGHER MOUNTAINS IN THE TEENS. FRIDAY NOT MUCH WARM UP WITH SOME
COLD AIR ADVECTION STILL CONTINUING. HIGHS SIMILAR TO THURSDAY MID
40S TO MID 50S. NICE WARM UP SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY AS SURFACE HIGH
SETTLES OVER THE SE STATES AND RIDGING ALOFT MOVES ALONG THE EAST
COAST. GFS BEGINS TO INCREASE CLOUD COVER SUNDAY INTO MONDAY AHEAD
OF SYSTEM DEVELOPING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND MS VALLEY. WITH
STRENGTH OF RIDGE TO THE SOUTH MODELS HANG THIS SYSTEM UP OVER OHIO
VALLEY AND SHEAR OFF MOST OF THE ENERGY TO THE NORTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA. MAIN SYSTEM TO AFFECT FORECAST AREA LOOKS TO BE ONE
OVER MEXICO AND THE SOUTHWEST STATES MONDAY THAT MOVES INTO THE MS
AND OH VALLEYS TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY WARM IN THE 60S TO
POSSIBLY LOWERS 70S WITH SOME AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS. MODELS NOW FASTER WITH THE SYSTEM
MOVING IT EAST RAPIDLY TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. WILL
LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN WEDNESDAY FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP THROUGH 
THIS EVENING.  MOISTURE LIMITED AND SO WILL JUST SEE SOME MAINLY 
LIGHT SHOWERS.  WILL CARRY NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE POPS TONIGHT.  
COLDER AIR WILL PUSH IN LATER TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...AND UPPER 
TROUGH WILL SWING ACROSS THE AREA.  MODEL SOUNDINGS LOOK RATHER 
UNFAVORABLE FOR ANY UPSLOPE SHOWERS/SNOW SHOWERS LATE TONIGHT AND 
THURSDAY...SO WILL CARRY NO MORE THAN SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF NORTH AND MOUNTAINS THU MORNING.  MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR 
SOME SNOW SHOWERS HIGHEST TERRAIN LATE TONIGHT/EARLY THU.  NOT MUCH 
ARGUMENT WITH MAV TEMPS SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH
FOLLOWING TONIGHTS SURFACE FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
THURSDAY NIGHT. A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY
INTO THE MIDDLE APPALACHIANS AND SPREAD SOME CLOUD COVER TO
NORTHEAST SECTIONS OVERNIGHT BUT NO PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED.
OTHERWISE SKIES WILL BE CLEAR SE TO PARTLY CLOUDY NE. LOWS SHOULD
BE THE COLDEST OF THE YEAR EXCEPT ACROSS THE NE WHERE SOME WINDS
AND CLOUDS WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 20S TO NEAR 30.
AREAS NEAR TRI AND SW NC VALLEYS SHOULD DROP TO THE MID 20S AND
HIGHER MOUNTAINS IN THE TEENS. FRIDAY NOT MUCH WARM UP WITH SOME
COLD AIR ADVECTION STILL CONTINUING. HIGHS SIMILAR TO THURSDAY MID
40S TO MID 50S. NICE WARM UP SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY AS SURFACE HIGH
SETTLES OVER THE SE STATES AND RIDGING ALOFT MOVES ALONG THE EAST
COAST. GFS BEGINS TO INCREASE CLOUD COVER SUNDAY INTO MONDAY AHEAD
OF SYSTEM DEVELOPING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND MS VALLEY. WITH
STRENGTH OF RIDGE TO THE SOUTH MODELS HANG THIS SYSTEM UP OVER OHIO
VALLEY AND SHEAR OFF MOST OF THE ENERGY TO THE NORTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA. MAIN SYSTEM TO AFFECT FORECAST AREA LOOKS TO BE ONE
OVER MEXICO AND THE SOUTHWEST STATES MONDAY THAT MOVES INTO THE MS
AND OH VALLEYS TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY WARM IN THE 60S TO
POSSIBLY LOWERS 70S WITH SOME AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS. MODELS NOW FASTER WITH THE SYSTEM
MOVING IT EAST RAPIDLY TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. WILL
LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN WEDNESDAY FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MIDWEST SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES

ENERGY DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF MANITOBA LATE IN THE SHORT TERM. AT
THE SURFACE...LOW PRESSURE DEEPENS WHILE HEADING NORTHEAST ACROSS
THE MIDWEST ENDING UP IN NORTHEAST ONTARIO LATE TONIGHT. MOISTURE
IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED AHEAD OF THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT AND LOW
LEVEL CONVERGENCE NOT TOO IMPRESSIVE AS THE BOUNDARY MOVES TOWARD
THE APPALACHIANS LATE TODAY. THEREFORE...KEPT POPS IN CHECK
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AS SHOWERS
WILL BECOME WIDELY SCATTERED HERE. THE PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION
WILL BE RATHER LOW AND LIMITED TO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE CLOSER TO THE
BEST INSTABILITY. PRECIP WRAPS UP FAIRLY QUICKLY TOWARD 00Z
THURSDAY AND MAINTAINED SLIGHT/LOW CHANCE POPS FOR A SMALL SECTION
OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE DURING THE EVENING.
STAYED CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS IN THE SHORT
TERM.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...BEHIND THE SURFACE FRONT
BUT AHEAD OF THE 500 MB TROUGH...THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
SOME RAIN SHOWERS ON THURSDAY. FALLING MIDLEVEL TEMPS AND AN
UPSLOPE 850 MB WIND AROUND 30 KTS WILL ENHANCE PRECIP CHANCES IN
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...ALTHOUGH MOISTURE WILL BE VERY LIMITED.

FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WILL FEATURE DRY AND CLEAR CONDITIONS AS A LOW 
LEVEL RIDGE MOVES ACROSS THE SE CONUS WITH A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW 
ALOFT. A GRADUAL WARMING TREND CAN BE EXPECTED EACH DAY...WITH HIGHS 
FRIDAY ONLY IN THE MID 40S TO MID 50S...RISING TO THE MID/UPPER 60S 
BY MONDAY. THE FLOW BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED ON SUNDAY...AND THE 
POSITION OF THE RIDGE NEAR THE ATLANTIC COAST WILL ADVECT LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. LOW PRESSURE WILL TRACK FROM THE PLAINS TO 
THE GREAT LAKES EARLY IN THE WORK WEEK. THE ECMWF AND GFS HAVE SOME 
TIMING DIFFERENCES REGARDING THE ONSET OF PRECIP WITH THE ECMWF 
PREFERRING MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT AND THE GFS PREFERRING TUESDAY. WILL 
HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR MONDAY BUT LEAN TOWARD THE GFS AND ITS

AREAS. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...SYSTEM TO OUR WEST 
HEADED THIS WAY...BUT LOOKING A LITTLE SLOWER NOW. MOST OF THE 
PRECIP IS EXPECTED BETWEEN ABOUT 16Z AND 06Z TOMORROW AND TOMORROW 
NIGHT. INSTABILITY LOOKS PRETTY MINIMAL...JUST GOING WITH SHOWERS 
VERSUS THUNDER FOR THIS EVENT.

LOOKS LIKE COLD AIR WILL ARRIVE LATE ENOUGH THAT FROZEN AND
FREEZING PRECIP WILL NOT BE AN ISSUE IN THESE PERIODS EVEN IN THE
MOUNTAINS. 

FOR TEMPS...WENT A LITTLE ON THE WARM SIDE OF GUIDANCE
FOR WEDNESDAY...ESPECIALLY EAST THINKING THAT PRECIP WILL HOLD OFF
LONG ENOUGH TO GET ALMOST MAX HEATING IN SOME AREAS. 


LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY AND THURSDAY 
EVENING WITH THE BRUNT OF THE DYNAMICS NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
HOWEVER...ENOUGH BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE AND INCREASING NORTHWEST 
FLOW WILL PRODUCE A CHANCE OF UPSLOPE PRECIPITATION INTO SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS AND NORTH AND CENTRAL FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS. WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. VERTICAL PROFILE 
BECOMES COLD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS THURSDAY 
NIGHT. LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION ANTICIPATED.

UPPER TROUGH EXITS AREA EARLY FRIDAY WITH MORE ZONAL FLOW AND 
SURFACE RIDGING INTO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT. DRY WITH CHILLY MORNINGS AND MILD AFTERNOON ANTICIPATED.

BY SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...SURFACE RIDGING MOVES EAST ALLOWING 
FOR INCREASING MOISTURE FLOWING NORTH FROM THE GULF INTO THE WESTERN 
TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS. INCREASING CLOUDS FROM WEST TO EAST 
SUNDAY. A SERIES OF FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVES WILL MOVE EAST NORTHEAST 
ACROSS PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES. GFS AND ECMWF BOTH SHOW A 
MOISTURE PLUME OF SUB-TROPICAL MOISTURE ADVECTING ACROSS THE WEST 
AND MIDDLE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND OHIO VALLEY WITH A SLOW MOVING 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. A HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT IS 
POSSIBLE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT BEST FRONTAL GENETIC 
FORCING AND UPPER JET DYNAMICS STAY WEST OF THE AREA THROUGH 
TUESDAY. WILL ONLY INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE - CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
THE RIDGE THAT HAS DOMINATED THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FOR THE 
PAST FEW DAYS WILL FINALLY GIVE WAY AS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
TRACK NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS TODAY. INCREASING MOISTURE 
ADVECTION WILL BEGIN TODAY WITH A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW. HIGH 
CLOUDS WILL NOT KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM RISING WELL ABOVE 
NORMAL...INTO THE LOWER 70S ACROSS MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY. 

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THAT ONSET OF PRECIP WILL HOLD OFF 
UNTIL WEDNESDAY AS MOISTURE DEPTH INCREASES RAPIDLY FROM WEST TO 
EAST. LIFT BECOMES WEAKER AS THE FRONT TRACKS EASTWARD DUE TO THE 
UPPER JET BEING POSITIONED OVER THE GREAT LAKES. INSTABILITY IS 
LACKING AS WELL AS LI STAYS POSITIVE AND 850 MB THETA-E VALUES ARE 
AROUND 325K. WILL HAVE JUST A CHANCE OF THUNDER IN WESTERN PORTIONS. 
WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS IN THE WESTERN HALF WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON...DECREASING TO A CHANCE EAST WEDNESDAY EVENING. PRECIP 
AREA SHOULD BE NARROW ALONG THE FRONT WITH RAPID DRYING BEHIND...SO 
WILL DROP POPS QUICKLY AFTER 06Z THURSDAY. WILL KEEP A LOW POP IN 
THE NORTH ON THURSDAY AS THE 500 MB TROUGH AXIS SWINGS BY. A MUCH 
COLDER AIR MASS BUILDS IN THURSDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE 50S AND LOWS 
THURSDAY NIGHT IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT AT THE START OF THE LONG TERM BUT
DIFFERENCES EMERGE BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND GFS BY SUNDAY. THE LONG
TERM STARTS OUT RATHER NICE AS TRAILING GREAT LAKES AND
NORTHEASTERN U.S. SHORT WAVE PROGGED TO DEPART THE APPALACHIANS BY
12Z FRIDAY WITH BUILDING HEIGHTS ALOFT ALONG WITH SURFACE RIDGING
FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. AN AMPLIFIED PATTERN DEVELOPS AGAIN DURING
THE WEEKEND AS AN UPPER TROUGH FORMS OVER THE WESTERN STATES. THE
GFS TRIES TO BRING A SHORT WAVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND
GREAT LAKES SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY AND GENERATES A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS
THE OHIO VALLEY BUT THE WAVE IS SLOWER AND MORE SUBTLE WHEN VIEWED
ON THE OPERATIONAL EUROPEAN MODEL. STAYED CLOSER TO THE ECMWF
DEPICTION CONCERNING THE WEEKEND WAVE AND STAYED THE COURSE WITH
SHORT WAVE ENERGY WHICH RIDES NORTHEAST OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS
AND ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. GFS/ECMWF
RELATIVELY CLOSE WITH TIMING OF THIS FEATURE WHICH DRAGS A
WEAKENING COLD FRONT AND ASSOCIATED SHOWERS TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS
AS ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPS INTO A DEEPENING WESTERN
STATES LONG WAVE TROUGH. DID NOT MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO
TEMPERATURES FROM THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATING THE 
SCENE THIS AFTERNOON AND SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY.  VALLEY 
FOG IN SOME LOCATIONS THIS MORNING...AND WOULD EXPECT GREATER THAN 
OR EQUAL TO THIS MORNING'S AMOUNT TOMORROW MORNING.  WINDS ARE VERY 
LIGHT NOW...AND SHOULD CONTINUE LIGHT OVERNIGHT...WITH EXCEPTION OF 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE WINDS WILL START TO PICK UP SLIGHTLY 
OVERNIGHT.  BEST WINDS LIKELY TO BE ON PLATEAU WHERE RETURN FLOW IS 
MORE ESTABLISHED.  ALSO THIS MORNING DRAINAGE THAT COOLED VALLEY 
LOCATIONS TO FORM THE FOG WERE COOLER THAN SURROUNDING MID TO HIGH 
TERRAIN IN MANY CASES.  THINK THE SAME SCENARIO WILL OCCUR 
TONIGHT...SO HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL HAVE WARMER TEMPS LATE TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST TUESDAY NIGHT AS DEVELOPING 
FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO MS VALLEY. CLOUDS SHOULD SLOWLY INCREASE 
OVERNIGHT AND THEN BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY BY AFTERNOON EXCEPT ACROSS 
NORTHEAST SECTIONS. THE BEST INSTABILITY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY WILL BE ACROSS THE LOWER TN VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT AND THEN 
ALONG THE GULF COAST WEDNESDAY SO DID NOT INCLUDE THUNDERSTORMS. 
HOWEVER A FEW THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT 
WEDNESDAY. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THE REGION 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY WITH RAIN SHOWERS LIKELY. AS THE 
AN UPPER TROUGH FOLLOWS THURSDAY THERE WILL BE SOME LINGERING 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF THE CWA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BUILD BACK IN FOR THE WEEKEND FOR DRY AND WARMING CONDITIONS. 
TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY WILL BE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN TUESDAY. MUCH 
COOLER THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHES MONDAY WITH 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING AND MOVING INTO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY.

.AVIATION...A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS IS MOVING QUICKLY EAST INTO

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL GIVE WAY TO AN UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE MID-SECTION
OF THE NATION. THIS TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST TO SOUTHEAST INTO THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATE TODAY THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY MORNING.
STRONG UPPER JET (300MB AROUND 110KTS) WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY PLACING THE FORECAST AREA UNDER MODERATELY STRONG
DIVERGENCE ALOFT. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL
CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE JET AND FRONTOGENETIC FORCING WILL
PRODUCE A SOLID BAND OF SHOWERS. INSTABILITY IS QUITE LIMITED...SO
ONLY INCLUDE ISOLATED THUNDER FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

AS UPPER LOW MOVES INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THURSDAY NIGHT...A 
MODERATELY STRONG DEFORMATION ZONE AND TROWAL WILL KEEP THE 
RAIN/SHOWERS GOING FOR THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA 
FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...THEN EXIT FRIDAY MORNING.

UPPER TROUGH IS FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE AND WILL MOVE OUT OF THE AREA 
FRIDAY WITH CLEARING SKY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT. WENT WITH A COMPROMISE 
OF MET/MAV TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE STILL 
LOOKS TO PROVIDE AN EXTREMELY NICE FALL WEEKEND...WITH PROLONGED SW 
FLOW ALOFT AS TROUGH IN THE CENTRAL/SRN ROCKIES HOLDS TO OUR WEST. 
I LIKED THE PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS WHICH DELAY THE ONSET OF SHOWERS 
AS LONG AS POSSIBLE...WITH ECMWF AND GFS SIMILAR IN HOLDING OFF 
SIGNIFICANT SHOWERS (POSSIBLE TSRA) UNTIL WEDNESDAY. 

MAX AND MIN FORECAST IS SOMEWHAT CHALLENGING AS GFSX MOS HAS BEEN 
TRENDING SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH HIGHS FROM 02/00Z TO 03/00Z MODEL RUNS 
AND SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH MINS AS WELL. SW FLOW ALOFT SHOULD KEEP 
TEMPS ABOVE CLIMO...BUT SURFACE HIGH PLACEMENT AND DRY AIR MAY LET 
SHELTERED VALLEYS DECOUPLE AND GET CLOSE TO COOLER MOS MINS...WHILE
PLATEAU AREAS AND HIGHER TERRAIN BENEFIT MORE FROM THE SW FLOW AND 
WARM AIR ALOFT. THIS LOOKS ESPECIALLY TRUE UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN 
SURFACE HIGH PRESURE SHIFTS EAST AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD 
FRONT. 

FOR NOW...I KEPT SOME CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS AND 
HPC MAX/MIN TEMPS...PLUS I STAYED CONSISTENT WITH NEIGHBORING NWS 
OFFICES AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE. ANYWAY...NET RESULT FROM WEATHER 
PATTERN WILL BE DRY WEATHER LIKELY UNTIL WEDNESDAY...AND TEMPS 
GENERALLY ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS FOR EARLY NOVEMBER.

STRONG MOISTURE TRANSPORT OCCURS AHEAD OF THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE

EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS RIDGING SURFACE AND 
ALOFT PERSISTS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. HEIGHT RISES 
ASSOCIATED WITH BUILDING UPPER RIDGE SUGGEST THAT TEMPS WILL 
MODERATE TO ABOVE CLIMO TODAY. GUIDANCE TEMPS GENERALLY CLOSE AND 
APPEAR REASONABLE BASED ON EXPECTED SCENARIO. THUS DID NOT DEVIATE 
MUCH FROM THOSE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN SYSTEM IS THE UPPER LOW 
AND COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE TN VALLEY BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. BEST 
RAIN CHANCES STILL APPEAR TO BE THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN THE WEST AND 
PERHAPS THURSDAY EVENING IN THE EAST. INSTABILITY IS LACKING...SO 
WILL JUST CARRY SHOWERS AT THIS POINT. UPPER RIDGE IS SHOWN TO BE 
BUILDING ACROSS WRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE FRIDAY...SO 
DECREASING CLOUDS LOOKS GOOD. NAM MODEL IS SLOWEST WITH SYSTEM... 
WITH GFS AND ECMWF SUPPORTING PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. THUS...LITTLE 
CHANGES MADE FOR THURSDAY THRU FRIDAY GRIDS. 

DRY WEATHER RETURNS FOR THE WEEKEND WELL INTO MONDAY...AS SW FLOW 
ALOFT DEVELOPS BETWEEN UPPER RIDGE OVER SE STATES...AND THE 
DEVELOPING UPPER TROUGH OVER ROCKY MTN STATES. NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN 
COULD HOLD OFF AS LATE AS TUESDAY NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY (NEW DAY 7)...
SO FOR NOW PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOK FINE WITH NO CHANCE OF RAIN 
UNTIL TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. OTHERWISE...A FEW MAX/MIN TEMP

PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE EAST OF THE AREA SHORTLY AS THE TROF EXITS 
THE REGION. WILL CONTINUE A DRY FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AND HANDLE ANY 
ADDITIONAL PRECIPITATION WITH A NOWCAST. WITH LINGERING MOISTURE... 
COULD SEE PATCHY FOG MAINLY ALONG THE LAKES AND RIVERS LATE TONIGHT. 
BUT NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH FOR AN ADVISORY. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS 
BRINGING SUNNY AND DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE BELOW NORMAL. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR 
TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD 
OVER THE AREA EARLY ON...THEN WILL SHIFT EAST ALLOWING LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM TO MOVE IN THURSDAY.  DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THERE WILL BE MUCH 
INSTABILITY THIS SYSTEM...SO NO MENTION OF THUNDER FOR NOW.  MODELS 
HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENT ABOUT HOW FAST THIS SYSTEM WILL EXIT...WITH 
12Z GFS SIGNIFICANTLY FASTER THAN 00Z ECMWF.  GIVEN UNCERTAINTY WILL 
LEAN TOWARD ECMWF AND CONTINUITY AND KEEP LOW POPS NORTH FRIDAY 
EARLY.  HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD REGAIN CONTROL FOR SATURDAY. FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE FAIRLY LOW FOR SUNDAY/MONDAY TIME FRAME GIVEN MODEL 
DISAGREEMENT/LACK OF RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY.  LATEST GFS HAS SHIFTED 
TOWARD A FASTER SOLUTION IN HANDLING NEXT FRONT...BRINGING 
POSSIBILITY OF SHOWERS TO THE FORECAST BY SUNDAY.  00Z ECMWF IS 
SLOWER AND KEEPS THINGS MAINLY DRY THROUGH MONDAY.  GIVEN 
UNCERTAINTY AM HESITANT TO PUT POPS BACK IN SUNDAY AFTER MID SHIFT

LOCATIONS OFF TO A SLOW TEMP RISE THIS MORNING DUE TO FOG BUT SHOULD 
REACH FORECAST MAX. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FREEZING TEMPS GENERALLY NOTED 
ACROSS ALL BUT PARTS OF THE SRN VALLEY THIS MORNING...WHILE SITES 
SUCH AS CHA/TYS/OQT STILL RUNNING IN THE MID 30S. HOWEVER...RURAL OR 
OUTLYING AREAS LIKELY DOWN TO 32 DEGREES OR LOWER...SO FREEZE 
WARNING WILL RUN THROUGH 10 AM EDT AS ISSUED. THE OTHER CONCERN IS 
SOME LOCALLY DENSE FOG AND LOW CLOUDS AT TRI.

WARMER MOS HIGHS LOOKED GOOD FOR SRN AND PLATEAU AREAS...BUT KEPT SW 
VA AND NE TN AREAS CLOSER TO THE SLIGHTLY COOLER MOS HIGHS. NAM 
MODEL IS QUITE DRY WITH THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY UPPER TROUGH 
AND ASSOCIATED WEAK FRONT MONDAY...WHILE GFS AND ECMWF BRING LIGHT 
SHOWERS INTO NRN AREAS MONDAY MORNING. HOWEVER...EVEN THOSE MODELS 
SUPPORT DRY FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. AREAS THAT KEEP NEAR CALM WINDS 
TONIGHT COULD SEE AREAS OF FROST...WHILE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS LOOK 
TO BE NO COOLER THAN MID TO UPPER 30S. 

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK SYSTEM MOVES INTO RIDGE 
OF HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE EAST COAST MONDAY. PARED DOWN AREA OF 
SHOWERS TO JUST EDGE OF NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES AND 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. PRECIPITATION VERY LIGHT. TEMPERATURES 
SIMILAR TO TODAY WITH A FEW MORE CLOUDS NORTH. ANOTHER SEASONABLY 
COLD NIGHT WITH NORTHERN AREAS NEAR TO BELOW FREEZING AND MID 30S 
SOUTH. HIGH PRESSURE STRENGTHENS AGAIN FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BUT 
TEMPERATURES ONLY A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER. THURSDAY A SURFACE LOW 
MOVES ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND TO THE MID ATLANTIC BY FRIDAY. 
CANADIAN AND GFS WEAKEN SYSTEM FRIDAY WITH RIDGING STRENGTHENING BY 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. ECMWF IS MUCH STRONGER WITH THURSDAY 
SYSTEM AND KEEPS MAIN AREA OF RAIN OVER OHIO VALLEY. DELAYED START OF

320 PM EDT WED OCT 26 2011

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WARM SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TODAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WEAKENS 
AND MOVES EAST OF THE AREA. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SE TONIGHT INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. UPPER PATTERN REMAIN COMPLEX THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM. STRONGER JET SEGMENT CARVING LONGER WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST 
THROUGH THE OHIO RIVER VALLY ON THURSDAY. SEPARATE SHORT WAVE 
SEGMENT WILL SLIDE SE INTO TX. SHALLOW COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SE INTO 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY THURSDAY EVENING. GOOD LAYER SHEAR WITH 
ABOVE NORMAL LAYER MOISTURE WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR GOOD 
PRECIPITATION COVERAGE ALONG FRONT. INSTABILITY WILL BE LOW BUT LEFT 
ISOLATED MENTION OF THUNDER BUT CHANCES ARE LOW. WARM TONIGHT AND 
EARLY THURSDAY IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT. DEEPER MOISTURE SHIFTS EAST 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS COLD AIR ADVECTION SLOWLY GETS UNDERWAY. 
ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVES ACROSS TN VALLEY ON FRI. THIS 
LIFT WILL HELP SOME POST FRONTAL RAIN TO DEVELOP. WENT ON THE HIGH 
SIDE FOR POPS FAVORING THE EAST WHILE EXPECTED AMOUNTS TO BE LIGHT. 
TEMPS BELOW NORMAL ON FRIDAY.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SECOND HALF OF LONG 
TERM REMAINS LOW CONFIDENCE AS MAIN MEDIUM-RANGE OPERATIONAL MODELS 
PROFOUNDLY DISAGREE DURING THAT TIME FRAME. THE CANADIAN MODEL AND 
MOST GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS TEND TO SUPPORT THE DRIER GFS SOLUTION 
OVER THE ECMWF. HAVE DISCOUNTED ECMWF SOLUTION AS AN ANOMALY FOR 
NOW. THUS HAVE CONTINUED GENERALLY DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE LONG 
TERM. FOR TEMPS...DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE WHICH 
DEPICTS TEMPS SLOWLY RECOVERING TO NEAR CLIMO BY LATE IN THE LONG 
TERM AFTER A BELOW-CLIMO REGIME THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND EARLY WORK 
WEEK.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXITING THE 
AREA WILL PROVIDE ONE MORE DAY OF DRY AND WARM CONDITIONS.  THE 
WEATHER PATTERN WILL CHANGE OVERNIGHT AS A WEAK COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES THE AREA.  IN ADVANCE OF THIS FRONT...MID AND HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE FROM WEST TO EAST WITH A FEW SHOWERS POSSIBLY 
REACHING INTO THE FAR NORTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS TOWARDS MORNING.  
WILL KEEP POPS AT 20 TO 30 OVER THESE LOCATIONS AND CONFINED PRECIP 
TO AFTER 06Z.  AT FOR TEMPERATURES...GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK 
REASONABLE AND STAYED CLOSE.

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...OVERALL FORECAST CONFIDENCE 
FAIRLY HIGH EARLY ON...BUT DETERIORATES RATHER QUICKLY FROM FRIDAY 
ON AS MODEL AGREEMENT BECOMES RATHER POOR.  FRONT WILL PUSH INTO THE 
AREA ON THURSDAY AND SHOULD SHIFT TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST BY THURSDAY 
NIGHT.  NAM PUSHES FRONT FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST THAN GFS BY 
FRIDAY...WHILE GFS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH UPPER TROUGH THAT MOVES IN 
FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT.  FOR THURSDAY WILL KEEP MENTION OF SLIGHT 
CHANCE THUNDER...ALTHOUGH INSTABILITY LOOKS QUITE LIMITED AT 
BEST...AND LIKELY POPS.  WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY 
INTO EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT WITH UPPER TROUGH MOVING IN.  FOR NOW WILL 
NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO DRY FORECAST FOR SATURDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY WHICH AGREES FAIRLY WELL WITH DRIER GFS SOLUTION...DESPITE 
THE FACT THAT ECMWF BRINGS MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED TROUGH AND 
SIGNIFICANT PRECIP TO THE AREA IN THE MONDAY/TUESDAY TIME FRAME.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE 
AND ALOFT WAS LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS 
AFTERNOON. PLEASANT FALL WEATHER TO CONTINUE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. 
LOW PRESSURE WAS OVER IOWA AHEAD OF A TROUGH DIGGING SOUTH OVER THE 
NW PART OF THE COUNTRY THIS AFTERNOON. THE SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE 
SLOWLY EAST NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. A 
COLD FRONT WILL DROP INTO THE OHIO VALLEY WEDNESDAY. THERE WILL BE 
LITTLE AFFECT FROM THIS SYSTEM TONIGHT EXCEPT THAT MID SLOPE AREAS 
WILL PICK UP SOME SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WIND AND STAY WARM...FROM NEAR 
50 TO THE MID 50S. OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS LOWS WILL DROP TO THE MID 
TO UPPER 40S EXCEPT NEAR 40 IN THE TRI CITIES AIRPORT AREA AND THE 
COLD AIR DRAINAGE VALLEY LOCATIONS OF SW NC. WEDNESDAY CONDITIONS 
SIMILAR TO TODAY BUT INCREASING HIGH CLOUDS NORTH AND WEST. SW WINDS 
WILL ALSO INCREASE AS PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BETWEEN LOW 
PRESSURE IN OH AND HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SE STATES.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO 
SLOW DOWN THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED CONVECTION WEAKENING AS IT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
ON THURSDAY. THIS WEAKENING TREND IS DUE TO MOST OF THE UPPER-LEVEL 
DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION AND REMAINING NORTH OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO AMPLIFY OVER THE MS 
RIVER VALLEY ON FRIDAY...WITH THE ECMWF MODEL REVEALING A MORE 
AMPLIFIED TROUGH THAN THE GFS MODEL...RESULTING IN A STRONGER 
SURFACE LOW OVER THE SOUTHEAST ON FRIDAY AND MORE PRECIP OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY 
CONSISTENT WITH THEIR DIFFERING SOLUTIONS FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE 
WEEK...SO WILL TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE SOLUTION BY KEEPING A 
LINGERING CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY 
NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...BRINGING DRY CONDITIONS AND UNSEASONABLY 
COLD TEMPS. THIS HIGH THEN SLOWLY DRIFTS EAST BY EARLY NEXT WEEK... 
WITH A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW DEVELOPING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY AND 
BRINGING MODERATING TEMPS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER 
THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED FORECAST...WHICH 
IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH A SLOWER PROGRESSION OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT FOR THE 
LATER HALF OF THE WEEK...WITH RAIN REMAINING NORTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA UNTIL LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY... 
AND THEN SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON FRIDAY. MODELS 
DIVERGE WITH THE SPEED OF THIS UPPER TROUGH AFTER FRIDAY...AND WILL 
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE SOLUTION WITH RAIN CHANCES 
LINGERING UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN SLOWLY BUILD 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...CREATING DRY 
AND UNSEASONABLY COLD CONDITIONS INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED FORECAST...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DEPARTING UPPER TROUGH WILL GIVE 
WAY TO RIDGING DURING THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.  WEAK SURFACE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL SAG SOUTH TOWARD THE AREA AND MAY BRING A FEW MORE 
CLOUDS NORTH LATER TODAY/EARLY TONIGHT...BUT SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR 
OVERALL.  TEMPERATURES WILL NOT BE FAR FROM SEASONAL NORMS.  WILL 
STAY CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS...WHICH LOOK REASONABLE.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT 
WITH NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE TROUGH RIDING STEADILY SOUTHEAST OUT 
OF THE CANADIAN ROCKIES TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AND ARRIVING IN THE 
MIDWEST U.S. BY 12Z THURSDAY. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
CONFIGURED A LITTLE MORE EAST THROUGH WEST AS IT DROPS SLOWLY 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. ADJUSTED POPS BACK A 
BIT WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH BETTER TIME RESOLUTION 
INDICATED BY MODELS. THE MAIN EVENT SHOULD OCCUR ON THURSDAY WITH 
COLD FRONT PROGRESSING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. RAISED POPS TO LIKELY CATEGORY FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
AS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FORM ALONG THE BOUNDARY. SUCCESSIVE 
MODEL RUNS HAVE DOWNPLAYED THE TRAILING SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH WHICH WOULD CONCEIVABLY SLOW THE FRONT DOWN AND KEEP PRECIP 
IN THE AREA FOR A LONGER PERIOD OF TIME. THEREFORE...DROPPED 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIP BACK SUBSTANTIALLY FROM WEST THROUGH EAST 
LATER IN THE DAY THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. STAYED THE COURSE 
WITH NEIGHBORING WFOS IN DISCOUNTING A TRAILING CLIPPER TYPE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM FOR LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. THUS THE FORECAST 
REMAINS DRY RIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TRIED TO INCORPORATE THE NEW

STAY PRECIP FREE.  SHOULD SEE SOME JUST SOME MAINLY HIGH/MID CLOUDS 
ESPECIALLY THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  MAY BE SOME FROST AGAIN 
NORTHERN TN VALLEY LOCATIONS THAT ARE STILL IN FREEZE PROGRAM...SO 
WILL KEEP PATCHY FROST MENTION THERE.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST 
MODEL SOLUTIONS ARE SIMILAR AND CONFIDENCE IS RELATIVELY HIGH WITH 
WEAKENING SHORT WAVE ENERGY PASSING EAST THROUGH THE EASTERN THIRD 
OF THE NATION ON MONDAY. MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE LACKING WITH THIS 
FEATURE AND KEPT DRY FORECAST IN PLACE FOR MONDAY. RIDGING BUILDS 
INTO THE EASTERN STATES MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY NIGHT ALLOWING A 
CONTINUATION OF THE DRY PATTERN WITH SLIGHTLY MILDER TEMPERATURES. 
MODELS STILL FAIRLY CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF UPPER TROUGH EXTENDING 
FROM THE GREAT LAKES SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE FOUR CORNERS EARLY ON 
WEDNESDAY WITH A SURFACE WAVE OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST DRAGGING A COLD 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY STEADILY EAST FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE MID 
SOUTH BY 12Z THURSDAY. HOWEVER...THE GFS INDICATES MUCH LESS 
SEPARATION WITH SHORT WAVE ENERGY OVER THE SOUTHWEST U.S. AND THAT 
WHICH CROSSES THE GREAT LAKES REGION. STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO AN 
ECMWF/CANADIAN SOLUTION WHICH INDICATES A STRONGER SOUTHERN STREAM 
WAVE WHICH TRAILS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS PERHAPS SLOWING SUFACE 
COLD FRONTAL PROGRESS THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. THEREFORE HELD ONTO CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. BECAUSE OF DIVERGING MODEL 
SOLUTIONS THURSDAY AND BEYOND...FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS LOWER DURING 
THIS PERIOD. MODEL TIMING IS A PROBLEM FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY BUT 
GENERALLY AGREE ON A TRAILING SHORT WAVE DROPPING SOUTHEAST OUT OF 
THE GREAT LAKES GENERATING SHOWERS FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT AND

(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO SIT OVER THE REGION THROUGH 
SUNDAY...WHILE AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND JET WILL APPROACH FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO 
DROP INTO THE 30S ONCE AGAIN TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH DEW POINTS THIS 
AFTERNOON SUGGEST LOWS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES HIGHER THAN LAST NIGHT. 
LOCATIONS IN NE TN...SW VA...AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL SEE 
MAINLY MID 30S WITH POCKETS OF LOWER 30S TONIGHT...AND A FROST 
ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED FOR THESE AREAS. MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY 
INCLUDING TYS AND CHA SHOULD BE IN THE UPPER 30S. PATCHY FOG IN 
VALLEYS AND NEAR WATER CAN BE EXPECTED AGAIN AS WELL. AS THE UPPER 
TROUGH APPROACHES TOMORROW...HIGH CLOUDS WILL INCREASE...BUT SHOULD 
HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON TEMPS...WHICH WILL RISE INTO THE 60S OUTSIDE 
THE MOUNTAINS. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
WEAK UPPER TROUGH WILL CONTINUE PASSING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
SUNDAY NIGHT WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES SOUTH AND PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES 
NORTH. TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER 
ESPECIALLY NORTH AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL 
KEEP AIR MIXED. STILL THE COLDER VALLEYS IN NE TN AND SW NC MAY SEE 
A LITTLE FROST. GENERALLY LOWS WILL BE LOWER TO MID 40S. TROUGH 
EXITS MONDAY AND HIGH PRESSURE REBUILDS OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY. TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES WARMER 
STILL MONDAY UPPER 60S TO MID 70S. MORE NOTICEABLE WILL BE LOWS 
MONDAY NIGHT IN THE 40S TO LOWER 50S AS RIDGING ALOFT MOVES OVER SE 
STATES. LOW PRESSURE BEGINS TO DEVELOP OVER THE PLAINS TUESDAY. OVER 
THE SOUTHEAST EVEN WARMER TEMPERATURES WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
SHIFTING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. BIG CHANGES IN PATTERN NEAR THE 
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AS ACTIVE FRONT DEVELOPS OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY INTO THE PLAINS WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. CLOUDS INCREASE 
WEDNESDAY WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS BUT ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH DIGS 
SOUTH INTO THE FOUR CORNERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS SLOWS THE FRONT DOWN WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE FRONT NOT UNTIL THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. GFS MODEL BRINGS DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER

12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS 1000-850 MB THICKNESS VALUES ABOUT 12M
GREATER TODAY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. SO WITH FULL SUN...WE SHOULD
SEE HIGHS A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...IN THE 60S ACROSS

WELL IN LINE WITH THE CURRENT FORECAST...SO NO UPDATE WILL BE NEEDED.

WASHINGTON AND RUSSELL COUNTIES...THE TN MOUNTAINS...AND SW NC
HAD A HARD FREEZE THIS MORNING. THESE AREAS WILL BE REMOVED FROM
THE FROST/FREEZE PROGRAM. POCKETS OF NEAR-FREEZING TEMPERATURES
WERE FOUND IN SCOTT...WISE...AND LEE COUNTIES IN VA...AND IN THE
TRI-CITIES AREA AND NORTHERN TN VALLEY. THE FREEZE PROGRAM WILL BE
KEPT ALIVE IN THESE AREAS AS THE FREEZE DID NOT APPEAR TO BE
WIDESPREAD ENOUGH. A FROST ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED FOR THESE AREAS
TONIGHT...BUT WILL AWAIT THE 12Z MODEL RUNS BEFORE DECIDING.

WILL BE KEPT AS IS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A WEAK SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY...BUT MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED AND
DYNAMICS WEAK...SO NO PRECIPITATION ANTICIPATED WITH LITTLE TO
ANY CLOUDS AS WELL. ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE IN NORTHWEST FLOW WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES...BUT MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS WILL STAY NORTH 
OF THE AREA.

FOR MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH FAST ZONAL 
FLOW ALOFT.  ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY 
TUESDAY WHICH WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT INTO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY FOR 
WEDNESDAY. THE FRONT WILL PULL CLOSE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS...MAINLY OVER THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. GFS AND ECMWF ARE HAVING DIFFERENCES IN 
RESPECT TO A POTENTIALLY STRONGER UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED 
CYCLOGENESIS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FOR

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND A DRY NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL
PROVIDE CALM WINDS AND CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT. GOOD RADIATIONAL
COOLING CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN LOWS TEMPS IN THE 30S AREA-
WIDE...AND MAYBE SOME PATCHY FOG NEAR BODIES OF WATER. ELEVATED AND
SHELTERED VALLEYS WILL HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCES OF DROPPING BELOW
FREEZING. CURRENT OBSERVED DEW POINTS AND THE LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE
SUGGESTS LOWS IN THE MID 30 ACROSS MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY...WITH
SOME LOWER 30S IN THE NORTHERN VALLEY...SW VA VALLEYS...AND VALLEYS
ACROSS THE TN MOUNTAINS AND SW NC. THIS LINES UP WELL WITH THE
CURRENT FREEZE WARNING AND FROST ADVISORY AREAS...SO NO CHANGES
WILL BE MADE TO THOSE PRODUCTS. A 30 DEGREE DIURNAL TEMPERATURE
SWING WILL BE POSSIBLE TOMORROW WITH A DRY AIR MASS OVER THE
AREA...WITH HIGHS IN THE 60S IN MOST SPOTS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE
CONTINUES ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.
BUT A WEAK FRONT/TROUGH WILL APPROACH SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND PASS
THROUGH THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY MONDAY. MAIN AFFECT
WILL BE SOME CLOUDS ESPECIALLY NORTH BUT NO PRECIPITATION. LOWS
SATURDAY NIGHT STILL COLD WITH FROST OR LIGHT FREEZE IN PROTECTED
VALLEYS. HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL HAVE SOME LIGHT WINDS AND PROBABLY
ESCAPE A FROST. WILL LIKELY HAVE ANOTHER FROST ADVISORY. SUNDAY AND
SUNDAY NIGHT SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES AND A FEW MORE CLOUDS
SUNDAY NIGHT SHOULD KEEP FROST FROM FORMING. THICKNESSES RISE
MONDAY AS RIDGING BUILDS OVER REGION FROM THE WEST. HIGH PRESSURE
SETTLES OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES SO WARM TEMPERATURES CONTINUING
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE TUESDAY
NIGHT AS NEW SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. COLD FRONT
SHOULD STAY TO THE WEST WEDNESDAY BUT SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE
THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT MAINLY PLATEAU COUNTIES THEN ALL OF THE
AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. A SHARP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVES
OVER THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY DROPPING TEMPERATURES AND
CLEARING OUT SKIES. HIGHS FRIDAY WILL BE BELOW NORMAL IN THE UPPER
40S TO NEAR 60.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD 
IN TODAY...ALONG WITH DRIER AIR.  CLOUDS WILL DECREASE...AND SHOULD 
BE A MAINLY CLEAR NIGHT TONIGHT.  CLEAR SKY ALONG WITH LIGHT WINDS 
WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO FALL INTO THE 30S IN MOST LOCATIONS.

SOME LOWER ELEVATION AREAS WILL LIKELY SEE TEMPS BELOW FREEZING LATE 
TONIGHT...AND A FROST ADVISORY ELSEWHERE.  WITH CURRENT SATELLITE 
SHOWING CLOUDS HANGING TOUGH AND OBS SHOWING TEMPS RUNNING WELL 
ABOVE EARLIER FORECAST...WILL CANCEL CURRENT FROST ADVISORIES/FREEZE 
WARNINGS FOR CURRENT PERIOD.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...PRESSURE WILL BE HIGHER ON 
SATURDAY WITH A SURFACE RIDGE SETTLING OVER THE APPALACHIANS AND 
MUCH OF THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. LEADING TO A DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY DAY. 
BY SUNDAY A SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL BE MAKING ITS WAY EAST ACROSS THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THE MODELS SHOW A VORT MAX BUILDING ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES LATE IN THE DAY INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS WHILE ANOTHER 
WEAKER IMPULSE MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. MODELS STILL 
INDICATE MOISTURE WILL BE RATHER LIMITED IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS 
SYSTEM SO KEPT THE DRY FORECAST IN PLACE FOR NOW. HEIGHTS BUILD 
ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS A 
LONG WAVE TROUGH GRADUALLY DEEPENS ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES. THIS 
ALLOWS FOR A CONTINUATION OF DRY WEATHER WITH MODERATING 
TEMPERATURES. THE AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE 
FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL BUILD EAST TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. MODELS HAVE GENERALLY SLOWED THIS SYSTEM DOWN 
FROM THE 12Z MODELS SO ADJUSTED POPS BACK TO KEEP WEDNESDAY DRY 
ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION WITH A GRADUAL PROGRESSION OF POPS FROM 
WEST TO EAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DID NOT RAISE POPS HIGHER THAN 30 
PERCENT AT THIS TIME DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING WITH THIS HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED SYSTEM. IT APPEARS THAT HIGHEST POPS MAY OCCUR ON THURSDAY 
WITH COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE OCCURRING AT THIS TIME. MAINTAINED A 
DECENT CHANCE FOR POST FRONTAL SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT. CONCERNING 
TEMPERATURES GENERALLY UNDERCUT SUGGESTED MEX MOS GUIDANCE WHICH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
CLOUDS AND WIND WILL BE DIMINISHING THROUGH THE EVENING AS COLDER
AND DRIER AIR SETTLES OVER THE REGION. LINGERING LIGHT RAIN OR
DRIZZLE IS EXPECTED TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT TONIGHT OVER THE
NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF CWA. DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH THE WIND DROPS AND
HOW CLEAR THE SKIES GET...THERE IS A POSSIBILITY OF FREEZING TEMPS
TONIGHT OVER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND THE EASTERN
MOUNTAINS. TO BLEND WITH SURROUNDING WFO/S WE HAVE GONE WITH A
FREEZE WARNING TONIGHT FOR THOSE AFOREMENTIONED AREAS. FRIDAY
SHOULD BE A COOL BUT FAIR DAY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. A WEAK FRONT WILL PASS BY MAINLY TO THE NORTH 
LATE SUNDAY INTO EARLY MONDAY WHICH WILL BRING SOME CLOUDS AND SOME 
SPRINKLES OF RAIN BUT FOR NOW THINK AIR MASS TO DRY FOR RAIN IN THE 
FORECAST AREA. COLD TEMPERATURES FRIDAY NIGHT OVER THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS WILL CAUSE AREAS OF FROST TO DEVELOP SATURDAY 
AND SUNDAY MORNINGS WITH A FREEZE WATCH FOR THAT AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. 
HIGHS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WILL BE WARMING FROM FRIDAY WITH WINDS 
BECOMING LIGHT SOUTHERLY SUNDAY AHEAD OF WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. 
STRONGER RIDGING ALOFT MONDAY INTO TUESDAY AHEAD OF A STRONGER COLD 
FRONT AND TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE PLAINS TUESDAY. THIS NEXT 
SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS IN FORECAST WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER MONDAY INTO WEDNESDAY THEN COOLER

AIRMASS IN PLACE...WILL SEE SOME WINTRY PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS DURING THE MORNING HOURS. SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS 
ARE NOT ANTICIPATED. WITH A STRONG GRADIENT AROUND THE LOW IT WILL 
BE A BREEZY DAY TODAY. ISSUED A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER

SEE BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AGAIN TODAY AND TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES
NEARING FREEZING MARK TONIGHT. BUT WILL HOLD OFF ON A FREEZE
WARNING FOR NOW. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH EARLY NEXT
WEEK...BUT THEN REVEAL SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE APPROACH OF
ANOTHER SYSTEM BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. HIGH PRESSURE IS PROGGED
TO SETTLE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS WEEKEND...WHICH
WILL LIKELY LEAD TO AREAS OF FROST DEVELOPING AROUND SUNRISE ON
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY MORNINGS. AN FAIRLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH
WILL THEN PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION ON SUNDAY
NIGHT...WITH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT IT
SHOULD BE PRECIP-FREE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER STRONGER COLD
FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL THEN
MOVE TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA BY MID TO LATE WEEK. GFS MODEL IS
FASTER WITH THIS COLD FRONT THAN THE ECMWF MODEL...MAINLY BECAUSE
THE ECMWF MODEL REVEALS A MORE AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER
THE WESTERN STATES. FOR NOW...WILL MAINTAIN FORECAST CONTINUITY BY
KEEPING LOW CHANCE POPS IN THE WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY NIGHT TIME
FRAME. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
THE SURFACE COLD FRONT HAS PROGRESSED TO NEAR THE TRI-CITIES 
AREA...WITH THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH AXIS TRAILING SLIGHTLY BEHIND AT THE 
BACK EDGE OF THE PRECIP NEAR MORRISTOWN. AN AREA OF LIGHT RAIN AND 
DRIZZLE EXTENDS FROM MIDDLE TN TO IL ON THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE CLOSED UPPER LOW. A SLOW NORTHEAST MOVEMENT OF THE 
LOW WILL BRING THIS AREA OF LIGHT PRECIP INTO OUR AREA TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW. MODEL CROSS SECTIONS OF RH AND TEMPERATURE SHOW MOISTURE 
CONFINED BELOW THE -10C LEVEL WITH NO SIGNIFICANT LIFT. THUS EXPECT 
AREAS OF DRIZZLE OVERNIGHT WITH A CHANCE OF MEASURABLE PRECIP. THE 
FREEZING LEVEL DROPS TO AROUND 3500 FT OVERNIGHT...SO WILL MENTION 
FREEZING DRIZZLE ABOVE THAT LEVEL FOR JUST A FEW HOURS LATE TONIGHT 
AND TOMORROW MORNING. 

PRECIP CHANCES WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH TOMORROW 
AS THE UPPER LOW PULLS FARTHER TO THE NORTHEAST. AGAIN...SHALLOW 
MOISTURE WILL RESULT IN MAINLY DRIZZLE AND ONLY A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF 
AN INCH OF RAIN ACCUMULATION. SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS IN SOUTHERN 
AREAS WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE INTO THE MID/UPPER 50S...BUT OVERCAST 
CLOUDS NORTH WILL HOLD TEMPS IN THE 40S. A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT 
WILL PRODUCE BREEZY AND GUSTY W-SW WINDS THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
DAY...BUT SHOULD STAY BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO PULL 
AWAY ON FRIDAY WITH STRONG SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN EARLY 
IN THE EXTENDED.  THIS WILL PROVIDE DRY CONDITIONS WITH A WARMING 
TREND FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  A COLD FRONT SLIDES THROUGH 
AROUND MONDAY.  MODELS DIFFER ON DETAILS OF THIS FEATURE BUT 
GENERALLY DEPICTED AS RATHER WEAK FRONT WITH LITTLE MOISTURE.  FOR 
NOW...WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR MONDAY.  SURFACE HIGH 
REBUILDS IN FOR TUESDAY.  MODELS IN POOR AGREEMENT BY THE END OF THE 
PERIOD BUT MOST GENERALLY HINT AS A STRONGER FRONT MOVING IN AROUND 
WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY.  FOR NOW...WILL INTRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
FOR WEDNESDAY.

FRIDAY MORNING RESULTING IN AREAS OF FROST. ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT 
IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION ON SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH THE GFS 
MODEL INDICATING SCATTERED SHOWERS DEVELOPING ALONG IT. HOWEVER... 
BOTH THE ECMWF AND CMC MODELS KEEP THIS FRONT PRECIP-FREE OVER THE

AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED FORECAST...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...STRENGTHENING MIDWEST STORM 
SYSTEM TO BRING RAIN AND MUCH COLDER AIR TO THE REGION AFTER AN 
EXTENDED DRY AND WARM REGIME. SOME CONVECTION ALREADY DEVELOPING OUT 
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OF ALABAMA. BANKING ON THIS AREA TO HOLD 
OFF ON ENTERING THE WESTERN REACHES OF THE FORECAST AREA TOWARD 
EVENING BUT IT MAY MOVE A LITTLE QUICKER. WENT WITH CATEGORICAL POPS 
FOR THE BIG EVENT TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SHIFTS 
NORTHEAST FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE UPPER OHIO 
VALLEY WHILE DRAGGING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE 
WEDNESDAY. NARROW AXIS OF INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT MAY ALLOW 
FOR A PERIOD OF CONVECTION TONIGHT FOLLOWED BY A LENGTHY PERIOD OF 
SHOWERS AS DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST. TRIED TO 
INDICATE A DRY PERIOD FOR NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE GREAT VALLEY 
WHERE MODELS SHOW A NICE SOUTHEASTERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW CROSSING THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. PRECIP SHOULD SPREAD 
ACROSS THIS AREA LATE TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS THE LARGE STORM 
SYSTEM MAKES ITS WAY EAST. TEMPERATURE FORECAST A LITTLE CHALLENGING 
WITH TIGHT GRADIENT EVIDENT BEHIND WESTERN TENNESSEE COLD FRONT. 
JUST STAYED IN THE MIDDLE OF GUIDANCE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. ON 
WEDNESDAY STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL CAUSE TEMPERATURES TO 
STRUGGLE TO RISE THROUGH THE DAY WITH LITTLE PROGRESS SO A COLD AND 
BREEZY DAY IN STORE.   

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER LOW MOVING 
SLOWLY NE THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY EARLY IN THE PERIOD. STRONG UPPER 
JET SWINGS WELL SOUTH...THROUGH N FL..UNDER UPPER LOW. SURFACE LOW 
WOBBLES WESTWARD THROUGH OH WED NGT THEN N OF OH ON THU. MRX CWA 
WILL SEE COLD AIR ADVECTION ESPECIALLY ABOVE THE BOUNDARY LAYER WITH 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. WINDS WILL BECOME BREEZY ON THU. PRECIPITATION 
TYPE STAYS MAINLY LIQUID WITH LITTLE OR NO MOISTURE IN THE SNOW 
GROWTH REGION. THE FREEZING LEVEL IS COMING IN A BIT HIGHER THIS 
MODEL RUN AT ABT 4500 FT THU. SOME OF THE HIGHEST ELEVATION COULD 
SEE SNOW BUT THE MAIN ELEMENTS WILL BE MODERATE TO POSSIBLY HEAVY 
ICING FROST ACROSS THE HIGHLANDS. WENT BELOW MOS TEMP GUIDANCE INTO 
THU. LOW PRESSURE MOVES NE AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS NE INTO 
THE REGION THU NGT AND SETTLES OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW NORMAL AND WENT SLIGHTLY BELOW MOS 
GUIDANCE. MODEL AGREEMENT HAS VARIED INTO NEXT WEEK. STAYED HIGH AND 
DRY...HOWEVER THE GFS HA BEEN TRYING TO BRING A FRONT IN BY END OF

.DISCUSSION...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SLOWLY STRENGTHENING ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL U.S. WITH SURFACE WAVE BUILDING NORTHEAST THROUGH THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. LINE OF SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
ADVANCING STEADILY EAST ALONG SYSTEM COLD FRONT. MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA SHOULD REMAIN DRY THROUGH EARLY EVENING AS THE BEST 
LIFT AND DEEPER MOISTURE WITH THE STRENGTHENING STORM SYSTEM WILL 
NOT ARRIVE UNTIL LATER TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. HOWEVER THERE 
IS A SMALL CHANCE FOR A COUPLE SHOWERS BUILDING ONTO THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU LATE IN THE FIRST PERIOD SO CURRENT POP FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. 
THE REGION WILL SEE A FAIR AMOUNT OF CI TODAY AS HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE 
STREAMS ACROSS AHEAD OF THE TROUGH. THERE IS SOME QUESTION AS TO HOW 
MUCH THIS WILL AFFECT WARMING THIS AFTERNOON BUT RAOBS INDICATE 
ANOTHER VERY WARM DAY WITH HIGHS IN THE 70S TO AROUND 80 SO WILL 
STAY THE COURSE. GOING FORECAST LOOKS GOOD BUT WILL UPDATE ZONES FOR 
COSMETIC CHANGES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A

FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN NORTH OF

AREA AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON. HIGH CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY...AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE OZARKS REGION 
SLOWLY MOVES EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MS 
RIVER VALLEY WILL HELP TO STRENGTHEN THIS LOW AS IT MOVES INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA BY THIS EVENING. MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO INDICATE A 
DECENT VEERING WIND PROFILE OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH THE NAM 
MODEL NOW INDICATING SOME MODERATE LEVELS OF INSTABILITY DEVELOPING 
OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY LATE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING

A MORE STABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO RESIDE AROUND THE MOUNTAINS 
THIS EVENING...AS SOUTHEASTERLY LOW-LEVEL WINDS INCREASE AHEAD OF 
THE APPROACHING LOW. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT CONDITIONS WILL BECOME 
FAVORABLE TONIGHT FOR SOME MOUNTAIN-WAVE ACTIVITY AROUND THE 
FOOTHILLS. OVERALL WIND PROFILE DOES NOT LOOK TOO STRONG....SO THINK 
WINDS IN THE FOOTHILLS WILL BE AROUND ADVISORY-LEVEL STRENGTH. THESE 
MOUNTAIN-WAVE WINDS SHOULD DIMINISH AROUND SUNRISE WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...AS A STRONG COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AND 
SWITCHES WINDS TO THE NORTHWEST. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL

IS EXPECTED TO WRAP AROUND THE REGION DURING THE EARLY PORTIONS OF

IS. COLD AIR ADVECTION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY COULD BRING 
LIGHT SNOW AND ISOLATED FREEZING DRIZZLE ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. BUT ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE LIMITED. THE COLD 
TEMPERATURES COULD RESULT IN FROSTING AND ISOLATED FREEZES ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS ON FRIDAY BRINGING DRY WEATHER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
BE DROPPING SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE CENTRAL ROCKIES INTO THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE SYSTEM WILL 
ENCOURAGE A TROPICAL LOW...CURRENTLY OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...TO MAKE A MOVE TO THE NORTHEAST. THE AIRMASS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION IS RELATIVELY DRY AND MAY ACTUALLY TAKE 
A WHILE TO MOISTEN TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS INFLOW FROM THE GULF IS 
IMPACTED BY THIS LOW. MUCH OF THE MOISTURE ADVECTION AND LIFT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE EASTERN SEABOARD WHILE 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AWAITS THE ARRIVAL OF THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL WAVE. MODELS CONTINUE TO ADJUST THE 
HIGHEST POPS BACK IN TIME SO STAYED WITH THE CATEGORICAL PROBABILITY 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY NIGHT AS SYSTEM COLD FRONT 
PRESSES QUICKLY EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE ENERGY FLOWS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE BACK SIDE 
OF THE MIDWEST TROUGH DEEPENING THE SYSTEM INTO A CLOSED LOW WHILE 
GENERATING WIDESPREAD SHOWERS WELL THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY. STAYED 
FAIRLY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS WHICH FEATURE A NICE MILD DAY 
RETURNING ON TUESDAY AND A RATHER DRAMATIC AND NASTY CHILL DOWN ON 
WEDNESDAY AS MAX TEMPS STRUGGLE TO RISE THROUGH THE DAY. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD...LARGE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE CONTINUES TO MOVE NE OF THE 
AREA. GOOD WRAP AROUND MOISTURE AND COLD AIR ADVECTION TAKES PLACE 
WED NGT AND THU. FREEZING LEVEL DROPS DOWN TO AROUND 3500 FEET. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR MUCH SNOW PRODUCTION. MOST 
OF THE AVAILABLE MOISTURE IS BELOW THE SNOW GROWTH REGION. THE 850 
MB WIND DIRECTION IS ALSO MORE WESTERLY THAN BEST CASE UPSLOPE 
CONDITIONS. THERE WILL BE SOME OROGRAPHIC SNOWFALL BUT RIME ICING 
AND FREEZING DRIZZLE WILL LIKELY BE THE MAIN WEATHER ACROSS THE 
HIGHLANDS INTO THU. PROLONGED SUPER SATURATED WATER WILL LIKELY 
RESULT IN HEAVY FROSTING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. PATCHY FROST 
AND SPOTTY FREEZES DOWN IN THE VALLEYS BY FRIDAY MORNING. SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NOTICEABLY BELOW NORMAL. MILD WARM UP 
BEGINS LATE SUNDAY AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH SOUTHERLY RETURN

TODAY...BUT REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT. WILL 
PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS TONIGHT WITH A 
STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN DEVELOPING.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS 
PERIOD...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT MAY BE DRAPED ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA...WILL BE LIFTING NORTHWARD...AS A WARM 
FRONT...WITH THE APPROACH OF THE MAIN COLD FRONT.  THE APPROACH OF 
THIS COLD FRONT HAS SLOWED IN LATER MODEL RUNS...WITH PRESENT MODEL 
CONSENSUS...BEING THAT THE FRONT WILL BE SOMEWHERE IN THE WESTERN 
CWA AT 00Z WED [8PM TUE]...WITH A NNE-SSW ORIENTATION.  SSWLY WINDS 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL LIKELY BRING DEW POINTS OF 55-60 DEG INTO 
THE WESTERN CWA...LIFTED INDICES OF -1 TO -3...CAPE VALUES 500-1000 
J/KG...ONCE AGAIN IN THE WESTERN CWA.  AS IT STANDS NOW...EASTERN 
AREAS WOULD HAVE LESS INSTABILITY DUE TO EVENING COOLING.  WOULD 
STILL EXPECT A THREAT OF THUNDER INTO THE EASTERN AREAS TILL 
MIDNIGHT DUE SLOW WEAKENING AFTER SUNSET.  WILL SEE HOW TIMING 
PROGRESSES WITH LATER MODEL RUNS.

FOR WEDNESDAY...NAM KEEPS FRONT IN TRI-CITIES AREA...BUT SURFACE 
LOW PLACEMENT OVER GA/SC IS NOT FAVORED BY HPC FORECASTERS...SO WILL 
PLAN ON THE FRONT SWEEPING ON THROUGH THE AREA...WITH COLD ADVECTION 
ALL DAY. FOR TEMPS...WENT ON LOW SIDE OF GUIDANCE FOR WED AND 
THU...OTHERWISE STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS.

COLUMN COOLS OFF ENOUGH TO ALLOW FOR LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS IN THE 
UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE APPALACHIANS AND IN SW VIRGINIA.  ALTHOUGH 
THERE COULD BE MANY HOURS OF LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHEST 
ELEVATIONS IN THE SMOKIES...WILL NOT ENTER AN ACCUMULATION...DUE TO 
WARM GROUND AND SUCH LIGHT PRECIP.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF 
SIGNIFICANT WEATHER UNTIL TUESDAY. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WITH A WEAK COLD 
FRONT EXPECTED TO SAG SOUTH AND EXTEND E-W ACROSS SRN KY AND SW VA 
BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. THIS MAY PRODUCE A FEW CLOUDS BUT NO 
PRECIPITATION...WITH DRY WEATHER LASTING AT LEAST THROUGH DAYBREAK 
TUESDAY. MOS GUIDANCE HINTS AT VALLEY FOG TONIGHT AND MONDAY NIGHT 
BUT BOUNDARY LAYER LOOKS TOO DRY AND I EXPECT SOME LIGHT MIXING TO 
LINGER EACH NIGHT. 

NEXT UPPER TROUGH AND STRONG COLD FRONT WILL AFFECT MOST OF THE 
REGION BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. GFS MODEL IS SLOWEST IN PRODUCING 
CONVECTION WITH THIS SYSTEM...WHILE NAM AND PREFERRED ECMWF STILL 
SPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE TN VALLEY BY TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON. THUS...I SLOWED DOWN THE ARRIVAL OF CONVECTION TUESDAY 
BUT KEPT POPS AROUND 60 PERCENT...FOR BOTH CONTINUITY AND TO MESH 
WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. 

ANOTHER CLEAR AND MILD NIGHT WITH WARM AIR ALOFT SUPPORTING MOS MINS
OVERALL. WARM AND SUNNY MONDAY...BUT FORECASTED HIGHS ARE JUST BELOW 
RECORD HIGHS FOR OCT 17TH...CHA - 86...TYS - 85...TRI - 84...AND 
OQT - 84. MOS MINS CLOSE AND FOLLOWED FOR MONDAY NIGHT...THEN COOLER 
MOS HIGHS BEST IN THE WEST AND WARMER MOS HIGHS IN THE EAST WHERE 
SHOWERS ARRIVE LATER IN THE DAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH CONTINUES TO DEEPEN TUESDAY NIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY WITH CONVECTION TRANSITIONING TO SHOWERS. ADDITIONAL
SHORT WAVE ENERGY RIDES SOUTHEAST AROUND THE SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD
SHIFTING LOW CENTER KEEPING THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS GOING THROUGH
THE DAY WEDNESDAY. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL STREAM SOUTH ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AND WITH THE
SHORT WAVE LIFT IN PLACE A COLD RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH
WEDNESDAY. WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY THE DEEPER MOISTURE AND
LIFT WILL SHIFT FARTHER NORTH AND EAST WITH IMPACT ONLY ACROSS
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND MUCH OF THE HIGHER
TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. THE AIR MAY BE COLD ENOUGH
FOR A LIGHT SNOW SHOWER IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA WILL BE DRY ON THURSDAY HOWEVER...HELD ONTO A SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR A SHOWER ACROSS THE THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF VIRGINIA
EXTREME EASTERN TENNESSEE. HIGHER PRESSURE RETURNS FOR THE WEEKEND
WITH A RELATIVELY DRY AIRMASS IN STORE SO KEPT POPS BELOW FIFTEEN
PERCENT HERE.

255 PM EDT FRI OCT 14 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...AN UPPER TROUGH
ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE UNITED STATES WILL PRODUCE
WEST-NORTHWEST UPPER FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AIRMASS WILL BE
FAIRLY DRY WITH PWS GENERALLY BETWEEN 0.5 AND 0.75 INCH. A WEAK
FRONT WILL PULL INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT
WILL STAY NORTH OF THE AREA.

MAIN CONCERN WILL BE THE DRY AFTERNOONS WITH RELATIVE HUMIDITIES
APPROACHING 25 PERCENT MOST LOCATIONS...HOWEVER...WINDS WILL BE
BELOW RED FLAG WARNING CRITERIA. 

PATCHY FOG IS POSSIBLE AT/NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS EACH NIGHT.
ALSO...PATCHY FROST POSSIBLE SATURDAY NIGHT OVER THE HIGHER
MOUNTAINS VALLEYS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AMPLIFIED LONG WAVE TROUGH 
ESTABLISHES ITSELF OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DURING MUCH OF THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD. HOWEVER...WE SHOULD BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT ONE MORE REALLY 
NICE DAY ON MONDAY WITH SUNSHINE AND HIGH TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO TEN 
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL IN THE UPPER 70S AND LOWER 80S. BY TUESDAY 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL BE DIGGING FROM THE PLAINS STATES INTO THE 
MIDWEST DRIVING A SURFACE LOW ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT PRESSING EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. TWEAKED POPS UP 
TO LIKELY CATEGORY FOR TUESDAY WHILE TRYING TO TREND HIGHEST 
PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON MUCH OF THE AREA AND 
THE EXTREME EASTERN SECTION OF THE FORECAST TUESDAY EVENING. TYPICAL 
OF THE CHANGING SEASONS THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BE A SLOW MOVER AS 
ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE IMPULSES DROP THROUGH THE BASE OF THE TROUGH 
WITH WRAP AROUND MOISTURE AND LIFT KEEPING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS 
GOING WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. KEPT THE HIGHER CHANCE POP OVER 
THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH EMPHASIS IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN AS A NORTHWEST LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS. BY 
THURSDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH WILL HAVE INCHED FAR ENOUGH TO THE EAST 
TO KEEP DRY CONDITIONS IN PLACE THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. 
STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT BUT WITH AMPLIFIED TROUGH IN PLACE HAD TO TRIM SEVERAL DEGREES 
OFF SUGGESTED MEX MOS GUIDANCE FOR MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE 
PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT OVER THE PIEDMONT REGION OF THE CAROLINAS...WITH A MILD 
AIR MASS STILL LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS LINGERING OVER THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...WITH SATELLITE IMAGERY INDICATING THE BACK EDGE OF 
POST-FRONTAL CLOUDS QUICKLY MOVING INTO THE GREAT TN VALLEY. THE 
MAIN STORY FOR TODAY WILL BE THE GUSTY WESTERLY WINDS EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP BY THE AFTERNOON...BUT IT APPEARS THAT SUSTAINED WIND SPEEDS 
SHOULD REMAIN BELOW THE WIND ADVISORY THRESHOLD OF 26 MPH. THESE 
WINDS SHOULD QUICKLY DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET...WITH AREAS OF FOG 
LIKELY DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT DUE TO YESTERDAY'S RAINFALL. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...AND WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AFTER PLEASANT CONDITIONS 
THROUGH THE UPCOMING WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WORK WEEK...MODELS 
AND ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE THAT AN AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE 
COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY TUESDAY. 
HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT BEFORE 
TAPERING ON WEDNESDAY. HAVE ALSO CONTINUED TO MENTION THUNDER IN THE 
WEDNESDAY PERIOD BASED ON THE PROJECTED STRENGTH OF THE AMPLIFYING 
UPPER TROUGH. DRY CONDITIONS RETURN BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM AS 
UPPER TROUGH DEPARTS AND ZONAL FLOW FOLLOWS. TEMPS SIGNIFICANTLY 
COOLER BEHIND FRONT HOWEVER. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE

324 PM EDT THU OCT 13 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...CONVECTION STARTING TO 
INCREASE IN COVERAGE OVER THE PLATEAU AND IN INTENSITY GENERALLY 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. THIS IS LIKELY DUE TO THE 
COOLING OF MID LEVEL TEMPS AS COLD AIR ADVECTION OCCURS WITH 
APPROACH OF UPPER TROUGH. SPC MESO PAGE SHOWS POSITIVE CAPE NEARING 
500 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES AROUND -2 DEGS CELSIUS. STRONGEST CORE 
OVER UNICOI COUNTY PRODUCED SOME VERY SMALL HAIL (BELOW PEA SIZE) 
RECENTLY AND A RUMBLE OF THUNDER WAS HEARD AT MRX IN THE PAST 30 
MINUTES WITH A GOOD DOWNPOUR OF 0.40 OF AN INCH OF RAIN (NO HAIL).

PREVIOUS GRIDS WERE GENERALLY ON TRACK FOR TONIGHT...BUT I DID NUDGE 
POPS UP JUST A BIT FOR THIS EVENING WITH AREAL QUALIFIER INSTEAD OF 
CHANCE WORDING. OPTED TO CARRY ISOLATED TSRA THROUGHOUT THE EVENING
FOLLOWED BY DECREASING POPS AND JUST SHOWERS. 

SHOWERS SHOULD END EARLY FRIDAY...BUT ANOTHER SHOT OF VORTICITY DOES 
SKIRT THE NRN FORECAST AREAS. SW-W WINDS MAY BE BRISK DURING THE 
DAYTIME FRIDAY...BUT FOR NOW I STAYED BELOW WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA.
WILL LET MIDNIGHT SHIFT EXAMINE THIS AGAIN. 

OTHERWISE...DRYING OUT NICELY FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY WITH 
SEASONAL LOWS AND HIGHS. MOS GUIDANCE WAS CLOSE FOR ALL PERIODS AND 
FOLLOWED WITH A BLEND WHERE DIFFERENCES IN MAXES WERE NOTED. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...EASTERN STATES UPPER 
TROF WILL BE ON ITS WAY OUT EARLY IN THE PERIOD ALLOWING FOR RISING 
HEIGHTS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. THE FLOW BECOMES ZONAL WHILE A 
NICE...DRY SURFACE RIDGE SETS UP OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF 
THE NATION. THE FORECAST REMAINS DRY UNTIL TUESDAY WHEN THE NEXT MID 
LATITUDE CYCLONE BUILDS ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TOWARD THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. RAISED POPS TO GOOD CHANCE ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AS DEPICT SYSTEM COLD FRONT BUILDS THROUGH 
THE REGION. AMPLIFIED SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH INSTABILITY 
AVAILABLE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY 
NIGHT. BY WEDNESDAY THE UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO AMPLIFY WHILE 
SHIFTING VERY SLOWLY EAST AS ADDITIONAL PIECES OF SHORTWAVE ENERGY 
AND DEEP MOISTURE DROP SOUTH INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE UPPER SYSTEM. 
THIS WILL KEEP THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ALIVE WELL THROUGH THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY AND EVEN KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER ACROSS THE 
HIGHER NORTHERN TERRAIN AREAS INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HIGHER PRESSURES 
EDGE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY ALLOWING A RETURN TO DRY 
WEATHER AND EVEN SOME SUNSHINE.

ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON GENERATING SCATTERED TO
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND EVEN A BIT OF THUNDER AT TIMES DUE TO CHILLY
AIR ALOFT. TRIED TO USE SOME TEMPO GROUPS WITH MVFR VSBY REDUCTION
IN SHOWERS AT THE SITES. TRI IS THE ONLY SPOT WITH A CONTINUATION
OF BKN-OVC IFR CEILINGS. DON'T BELIEVE THIS WILL LAST TOO LONG WITH
SOME INSOLATION AND MIXING UNDERWAY. MORE ENERGY AND DEEP MOISTURE
CONTINUES TO SPILL IN BEHIND THE SURFACE FROPA TONIGHT SO HAD TO
KEEP A FEW SHOWERS GOING IN VICINITY FASHION AT TYS AND EVEN
PREVAILING AT TRI THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. NOT ENTIRELY SURE HOW
MUCH FOG WILL DEVELOP BUT TRIED TO KEEP THE FOG AT A MINIMUM AT CHA
AND TYS AS IT LOOKS LIKE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO
KEEP SOME WIND GOING AT THESE TERMINALS. HOWEVER...BELIEVE TRI
COULD SEE LIGHT OR EVEN CALM WIND DEVELOP LATE TONIGHT SO APPLIED
AN IFR VSBY AND CEILING HERE. WESTERLY SURFACE FLOW REALLY KICKS
IN ON FRIDAY WITH DRIER AIR STREAMING INTO THE REGION BEHIND

THE UPPER TROUGH SHARPENS AND BECOMES SLIGHTLY NEGATIVELY TILTED BY

BUT COOLER TEMPS ALOFT AND SUFFICIENT FORCING SHOULD SUPPORT AT 
LEAST ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SREF 
GENERALLY AGREE THAT MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK LOW OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN CONUS WILL SLOWLY PULL OUT OVERNIGHT FROM SOUTH TO 
NORTH AS AN APPROACHING TROUGH ACCELERATES THE WEAK AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE OUT OF THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. HAVE SLOWLY DECREASED POPS 
FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM BEFORE REMOVING 
POPS ALMOST ENTIRELY BY THE SECOND HALF OF THE DAY TOMORROW. FOR 
TEMPS... GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A NEGATIVELY-TILTED UPPER TROUGH AND STRONG UPPER JET WILL BE DIVING 
SOUTHWARD INTO THE TN VALLEY REGION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY. THE 
GFS CONTINUES TO BE A BIT FASTER THAN THE NAM TO BRING PRECIP INTO 
OUR AREA...BUT THE FASTER SOLUTION HAS SUPPORT FROM THE SREF. PRECIP 
SHOULD BEGIN ENTER THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH 
THE STRONGEST LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH 500 MB PVA AND UPPER DIVERGENCE 
AT THE NOSE OF THE JET STREAK COMING THURSDAY AFTERNOON. MORNING 
CLOUDS WILL PREVENT MUCH DESTABILIZATION...BUT MODELS INDICATE THAT 
SOUTHERN AREAS SHOULD SEE CAPE OVER 500 J/KG AND LI AROUND -2. WILL 
CARRY LIKELY POPS EVERYWHERE THURSDAY WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDER SOUTH 
AND A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH. PRECIP BEGINS TO EXIT TO THE NE THURSDAY 
EVENING. FOLLOWING THE FASTER GFS...WILL END ALL POPS BEFORE 12Z 
FRIDAY.

COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE TROUGH PASSAGE IS WEAK AS THE JET STREAM 
REMAINS NORTH OF THE AREA. HIGHS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WILL BE IN THE 
MID 60S TO LOWER 70S WITH FULL SUN...THEN RISE INTO THE 70S 
EVERYWHERE SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS A RIDGE SITS OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
CONUS. THE GFS HAS BEEN HINTING AT AN APPROACHING TROUGH FOR

REMNANTS OF A SUBTROPICAL LOW WILL BEGIN PULLING AWAY TO THE

CATEGORICAL TUESDAY EVENING TO A CHANCE IN SW VA BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. ON THE HEELS OF THIS SYSTEM IS A DEEPENING 
NEGATIVELY-TILTED MIDLATITUDE TROUGH. WE SHOULD SEE A DRY PERIOD 
FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND WEDNESDAY EVENING BEFORE POPS RISE LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH. GFS AND NAM HAVE TIMING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE PRECIP...PREFER THE FASTER GFS WHICH HAS BETTER 
SUPPORT FROM SREF AND ECMWF. GIVEN THESE MODEL DIFFERENCES AND THE 
LACK OF A GOOD FEED OF GULF MOISTURE...WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE 
RANGE FOR THE MOMENT. GOOD DIVERGENCE ALOFT WITH THE 
NEGATIVELY-TILTED TROUGH AND APPROACHING 300 MB JET WILL GIVE A 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS ON THURSDAY...THOUGH INSTABILITY IS 
MARGINAL. A DRY NW FLOW DEVELOPS WITH THE TROUGH PASSAGE ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT. 

WEAK COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE TROUGH BEGINS ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
CONTINUES THROUGH FRIDAY. WE DO NOT SEE A CANADIAN AIR MASS COME 
THIS FAR SOUTH AS THE UPPER JET STAYS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY REGION.

230 PM EDT FRI OCT 7 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...AMPLIFIED UPPER RIDGE WILL 
REMAIN OVER THE REGION AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR 
NORTHEAST WILL BUILD BACK TOWARD OUR AREA.  SHOULD BE MAINLY CLEAR 
THROUGH THE PERIOD.  MAV TEMPS LOOK TO BE IN THE BALLPARK...BUT WILL 
MAKE SOME TWEAKS...MAINLY UP A BIT. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE LONG 
TERM CONTINUES TO BE POTENTIAL FOR UNSETTLED CONDITIONS BY MID WEEK 
NEXT WORK WEEK. MODELS AND ENSEMBLES CONTINUE TO EXHIBIT POOR 
AGREEMENT AND RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY RESULTING IN CONFIDENCE THAT IS 
RELATIVELY LOW. TROPICAL SYSTEM EXPECTED TO FORM OFF THE FLORIDA 
COAST IS PROJECTED TO DRIFT INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS BY EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. THE TRACK OF THIS FEATURE IS STILL UNCERTAIN. LATEST 12Z 
GFS RUN HAS A PRECIP AXIS OVER THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN PORTION OF 
OUR CWA BY TUESDAY...WHEREAS PREVIOUS RUNS HAD TAKEN THE AXIS EAST 
OF THE APPALACHIANS. THE LATEST EUROPEAN RUN KEEPS MOST OF THE 
SIGNIFICANT PRECIP EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WHILE THE CANADIAN MODEL 
DEPICTS MUCH OF THE PRECIP SLIGHTLY WEST OF OUR CWA. GEFS ENSEMBLES 
NOT MUCH HELP AS THEY ALSO EXHIBIT A WIDE SPREAD AMONG ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS. AS SUCH...HAVE NOT MADE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING 
GRIDS/FORECAST. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM 
MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LITTLE CHANGE TO ONGOING FORECAST.
DRY CONDITIONS CONTINUE AS HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ACROSS THE REGION. 
MINOR TWEAKS TO TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS. WENT A TAD WARMER THAN
GUIDANCE TODAY. DRIER AND COOLER THAN GUIDANCE TONIGHT ACROSS NE 
AREAS AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTER SHIFTS SLIGHTLY SW. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE 
TO DOMINATE AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE WEEKEND FOR DRY...SUNNY AND 
WARM DAYS.  MODEL BEGIN TO DIVERGE ON MONDAY AND RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY QUITE POOR...WITH DIFFERENCE BECOMING SIGNIFICANT FOR 
MUCH FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED...CONFIDENCE QUITE LOW THROUGH 
THIS PERIOD.  WILL SEE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS 
THE AREA ON MONDAY WITH A SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH TO OUR SOUTH.  FOR 
NOW...HAVE LOWER POPS FOR A DRY FORECAST AS CURRENT MODEL RUNS 
TRENDING TOWARD ASSOCIATED PRECIP STAYING TO OUR SOUTH.  MAIN 
QUESTION FOR THE EXTENDED IS THE POTENTIAL OF REMNANTS OF A TROPICAL 
SYSTEM TRACKING INTO THE EASTERN U.S.  HAVE COMPROMISED BETWEEN 
MODELS BRINGING THE SYSTEM INTO THE MRX AREA AND OTHERS KEEPING THE 
SYSTEM TO OUR EAST.  AS SUCH...HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS OVER EASTERN 
ZONES AND LOWER POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE TO THE WEST FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY.  BY THURSDAY...WILL BE DEALING WITH AN APPROACHING COLD 
FRONT.  AGAIN CONFIDENCE LOW ON TIMING OF FRONT AND HAVE LEFT POPS 
AT SLIGHT CHANCE.  AS FOR TEMPERATURES...GUIDANCE LOOKS OK AND 
STAYED CLOSE.

FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY. SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE RIDGE WILL PROVIDE CLEAR 
SKIES AND ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEKEND. AS THE 
RIDGE SHIFTS CLOSER TO THE COAST...A MORE SOUTHEASTERLY FETCH WILL 
TRANSPORT SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA MONDAY...INCREASING 
CLOUD COVER AND LOWERING TEMPERATURES JUST A BIT. GFS AND ECMWF

KEPT AN OPTIMISTIC OUTLOOK AND KEPT 3SM BR AND JUST A SCATTERED LOW

FORECAST AS UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE IS ANCHORED OVER THE
EASTERN STATES WITH TROUGH SLOWLY DEPARTING TO THE EAST AND UPPER
LOW MOVING FROM THE NW STATES INTO THE ROCKY MOUNTAINS AND NORTHERN
PLAINS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. SURFACE HIGH SHIFTS EAST TO THE EAST
COAST BY SATURDAY. FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. OLD FRONTAL
BOUNDARY ACROSS THE NORTHERN CARIBBEAN AND EASTERLY FLOW IN THE

BEGINNING FRIDAY AND MOVE NORTH SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. EXPECT THE
MOISTURE WILL STAY SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND.
THERE MAY BE SOME INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND
SOUTH SUNDAY BUT THIS SHOULD HAVE LITTLE AFFECT ON TEMPERATURES.
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY GFS/ECMWF AND CANADIAN BRING A SURFACE LOW
FROM SOUTHERN FL NORTH INTO THE NW GULF WITH PLENTIFUL MOISTURE
NORTH ACROSS THE SE STATES. CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE WITH
RAIN HOLDING OFF UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT OR EARLY TUESDAY. THIS SURFACE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL 
CONTINUE ITS GRADUAL EASTWARD SHIFT TODAY FROM THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY TO A POSITION JUST WEST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. DRY AIR 
ALREADY IN PLACE AND CONTINUED SUPPRESSION OF CLOUD DEVELOPMENT  
WILL ALLOW FOR NEARLY FULL INSOLATION TODAY AFTER PATCHY EARLY 
MORNING FOG DISSIPATES. SHOULD BE ANOTHER CLEAR SKY AND CALM WIND 
ENVIRONMENT TONIGHT WITH A JUST A BIT OF FOG AROUND THE RIVER 
VALLEYS. STAYED VERY CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE TEMPERATURE BLEND FOR THE 
SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...AN OMEGA BLOCK OVER THE 
EASTERN CONUS WILL KEEP DRY AND UNSEASONABLY WARM WEATHER OVER THE 
AREA THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. HIGHS EACH DAY WILL BE IN 
THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S IN MOST SPOTS OUTSIDE THE 
MOUNTAINS...WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S. A 
SLIGHT EASTWARD DRIFT OF THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BRING IT TO A POSITION 
OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY SUNDAY...AND THE RESULTING 
SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL BRING ADDITIONAL MOISTURE TO THE AREA 
FOR SLIGHTLY MORE CLOUD COVER EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE GFS AND ECMWF 
SHOW A TROPICAL SYSTEM AROUND THE GULF COAST IN THE MONDAY-TUESDAY 
TIMEFRAME...BUT WITH SIGNIFICANT TIMING AND POSITION DIFFERENCES. AT 
THIS POINT WILL KEEP THE FORECAST DRY BUT WILL INCREASE CLOUD COVER 
FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
MUCH WARMER WEATHER IS IN STORE FOR THE AREA FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS 
AS A STRONG BLOCKING RIDGE SETS UP OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. ASIDE 
FROM THE CLOUDS IN SW VA AND NE TN EARLY THIS MORNING...SKIES WILL 
BE CLEAR THROUGH THE ENTIRE PERIOD THANKS TO SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE 
STRONG RIDGE. HIGHS TODAY WILL BE MAINLY IN THE 70S...WITH HIGHS 
TOMORROW RISING INTO THE LOWER 80S IN MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY. MID 80S 
WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE CHATTANOOGA AREA ON THURSDAY. OVERNIGHT LOWS 
WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE 40S IN THE DRY AIR MASS...WITH SOME LOWER 
50S BY THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE SURFACE FLOW TAKES ON A MORE SOUTHERLY 
COMPONENT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE PLEASANT DRY REGIME CONTINUES RIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH
MODELS DEPICTING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS SHIFTING FROM THE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO AN OHIO VALLEY THROUGH MID ATLANTIC STATES
CONFIGURATION AS LOWER PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE FLORIDA PENINSULA
EARLY IN THE WEEKEND. THE LOW DRIFTS WEST OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO
BY SUNDAY EVENING. BROAD EASTERLY FLOW DEVELOPS ALOFT BETWEEN THE
TWO PRESSURE SYSTEMS WITH MODELS INDICATING INCREASING MOISTURE
ADVECTION ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH AS THE WEEKEND PROGRESSES. EXPECT
MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA TO REMAIN MOSTLY SUNNY DURING THIS PERIOD
IN DOWNSLOPE FASHION WITH A FEW MORE CLOUDS APPEARING ACROSS
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA BY MONDAY. STAYED
WITH A DRY FORECAST THROUGHOUT... ALTHOUGH MODELS (ECMWF IN
PARTICULAR) GENERALLY POINT TOWARD INCREASING MOISTURE ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON MONDAY AS THE GULF LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM DRIFTS NORTHEAST TOWARD THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY IN
RESPONSE TO A SHORTWAVE LIFTING NORTHEAST FROM THE WESTERN STATES
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. STILL QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AT
THIS TIME STEP SO BEST TO STAY THE COURSE HERE. EDGED MAX TEMP
FORECAST A COUPLE DEGREES HIGHER THAN MEX MOS SATURDAY THROUGH
MONDAY WITH RIDGE HOLDING NEAR THE REGION WHILE GOING A FEW DEGREES
HIGHER THAN SUGGESTED MIN TEMPS.

TODAY...BRINGING COLDER TEMPS ALOFT TO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE 
AREA. THE RESULTING STEEP LAPSE RATES UP TO 750 MB WILL CAUSE CU AND 
STRATOCU TO FILL BACK IN THIS MORNING...WITH SCATTERED TO ISOLATED 
SHOWERS ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN WHERE MOISTURE DEPTH IS GREATER. 
PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT...BUT UPSLOPE 850 MB WINDS AROUND 30S 
KTS WILL ENHANCE SHOWERS A BIT IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WITH SOUTHERN 
AREAS BEING MOSTLY SUNNY...THERE WILL BE A LARGE TEMPERATURE SPREAD 
ACROSS THE AREA...FROM MID 60S SOUTH TO MID/UPPER 40S SW VA. WINDS 
WILL BE BREEZY AND GUSTY BUT SHOULD STAY BELOW WIND ADVISORY 
CRITERIA.

THE UPPER LOW BEGINS TO TAKE A MORE NE TRACK TONIGHT...BRINGING SOME 
DRYING ALOFT AND REDUCING PRECIP CHANCES AND CLOUD COVER. ADDITIONAL 
CLEARING AND DIMINISHING WINDS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO 
THE 30S IN MANY LOCATIONS. LOWS WILL BE MAINLY IN THE UPPER 30S TO 
LOWER 40S...BUT SOME MOUNTAIN LOCATIONS AND SHELTERED VALLEYS WILL 
SEE LOWER TO MID 30S. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TO THE 
NORTHEAST OF THE CWA PRODUCING SEVERAL WAVES TRACKING ACROSS THE 
NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF THE CWA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WILL GO WITH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH A COOLER AND 
DRIER AIR MASS MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA BEHIND IT. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER THE UPPER OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS ASSOCIATED AN AMPLIFYING 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS UPPER 
TROUGH IS NOW PROGGED TO EVENTUALLY BECOME ANOTHER CUT-OFF LOW OVER 
THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY SATURDAY...AND POSSIBLY BECOME QUASI- 
STATIONARY THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS A RESULT...CLOUDS AND A FEW 
UPSLOPE-GENERATED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER MAINLY THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL ALSO CONTINUE TO 
ADVECT UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH 
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATING THAT IT MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME LIGHT 
SNOW AFTER MIDNIGHT IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 3000 FEET. RIGHT 
NOW...IT APPEARS THAT THE PRECIP INITIATION REGION MAY REMAIN WARMER 
THAN -10 C...SO ANY PRECIP IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TONIGHT MAY HAVE 
A HARD TIME CHANGING OVER TO SNOW. IN EITHER CASE...ONLY A DUSTING 
OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SEEMS POSSIBLE SINCE THE GROUND TEMPS SHOULD 
ALSO BE FAIRLY WARM. THE COLDEST AIR IS EXPECTED TO SETTLE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH TEMPS FALLING INTO THE 30S 
ACROSS MANY AREAS LEADING TO SOME PATCHY FROST DEVELOPMENT IN THE 
VALLEYS BY SUNRISE ON SUNDAY MORNING. WITH A CUT-OFF UPPER LOW NOW 
EXPECTED TO LINGER A WHILE LONGER OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES... 
CLOUDS MAY KEEP FROST FROM BECOMING TOO WIDESPREAD FOR AN ADVISORY. 
FOR NOW...WILL MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF FROST AND A LITTLE SNOW 
OVER THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS IN A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT. AS FOR

A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE THIS MORNING WILL BRING GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS

BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA...THOUGH IT WILL BE BREEZY. AFTER SOME EARLY 
MORNING CLOUDS BECOME SCATTERED BY LATE MORNING...DAYTIME HEATING

THE UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES THIS MORNING WILL TRACK 
TOWARD THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TODAY...WITH A TRAILING VORTICITY 
LOBE AND VERY COLD 500 MB TEMPS PUSHING INTO SW VA AND NE TN 
TONIGHT. AN UPSLOPE 925-850MB WIND AROUND 25 KTS ALONG WITH STEEP 
LAPSE RATES AND LOW LEVEL CAPE OF 50-100 J/KG WILL GENERATE SOME

DROPPING INTO THE 30S IN THESE AREAS...EXPECT PRECIP TO BE SNOW IN 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...MAINLY ABOVE 3000 FT. WITH THE GROUND STILL 
RELATIVELY WARM...ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE LIGHT. AREAS SUCH AS HIGH 
KNOB...ROAN MTN...AND NEWFOUND GAP COULD SEE A DUSTING TO A HALF 
INCH ACCUMULATION. A FREEZE WARNING MAY BE NEEDED FOR THE MOUNTAINS 
TONIGHT...WILL HOLD OFF ON THIS FOR NOW AS THE EXTENT OF FREEZING 
TEMPS OUTSIDE THE HIGHEST PEAKS IS UNCERTAIN FOR THE SECOND PERIOD 
OF THE FORECAST. WINDS TONIGHT MAY ALSO APPROACH ADVISORY CRITERIA 
IN THE MOUNTAINS. WILL ISSUE AN SPS TO MENTION THE EARLY SEASON SNOW 
POTENTIAL...AND THE COLD TEMPS AND WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKS 
TO THE NORTHEAST OF THE CWA ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL

SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES WILL MOVE NORTHEAST THIS MORNING. A SHORT-WAVE
ROTATING AROUND THIS LOW IS CURRENTLY PRODUCING SCATTERED SHOWERS
OVER THE NORTHEAST THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS ACTIVITY WILL
END SOON AFTER SUNRISE. HAVE INCLUDE EARLY MORNING SHOWER WORDING. A
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA TODAY ALLOWING
SKIES TO BE MOSTLY SUNNY. A WARM DAY IS ON TAP AS WELL.

FOR TONIGHT...ANOTHER AND STRONGER UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE
GREAT LAKES AND UPPER OHIO VALLEY. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. MOISTURE IS LIMITED...BUT ENOUGH TO
INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. WILL ALSO INCLUDE A CHANCE OF SPRINKLES
ELSEWHERE. A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY EARLY WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY TO
PARTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT. FOLLOWED MOS GUIDANCE CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...GOOD CONTINUITY WITH MODELS 
FROM 12Z RUN...AND GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TIMING THE DEPARTURE OF THE 
UPPER TROUGH AXIS EARLY SATURDAY. UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGE THEN 
GRADUALLY BUILD EASTWARD...BRINGING DRY WEATHER AND COOLER THAN 
NORMAL TEMPS. HOWEVER...THE DRYNESS OF THE AIRMASS PLUS THE BUILDING 
UPPER RIDGE SUPPORTED INCREASING MAX TEMPS JUST A BIT BY MON THRU
WED. THIS ADJUSTMENT WAS IN LINE WITH 29/00Z MOS AND A BETTER MESH 
WITH NEARBY NWS GRIDS.

OTHERWISE...CONTINUED THE LOW POPS FOR MAINLY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY...MAINLY FOR SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN. LATER SHIFTS MAY WANT 
TO DROP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY...WHICH I KEPT MOSTLY FOR 
CONTINUITY. QPF SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT...AND PERHAPS NOT 
UNTIL AFTER 06Z SATURDAY...WHEN MOISTURE DEPTH IS GREATEST. THE ZERO 
DEGREE ISOTHERM AT 850 MBS WILL DIP ACROSS SW VA BY 12Z SATURDAY... 
BUT SOUNDINGS ARE NOT FAVORABLE FOR ANY SNOW. MINS DROP INTO THE MID 
TO UPPER 30S OVER SW VA...BUT WINDS SHOULD INHIBIT ANY PATCHY FROST 
FROM DEVELOPING ON SATURDAY MORNING.

FOR ALL TAF SITES.

AN UPPER LOW REMAINS ACROSS THE LOWER GREAT LAKES WITH A 
SPOKE OF ENERGY ROTATING THROUGH THE TENNESSEE-OHIO VALLEYS EARLY 
THIS MORNING. MODELS SHOW SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION MOVING ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN THIRD-HALF OF THE AREA THROUGH DAYBREAK. WILL ADD VCSH AT 
TRI THROUGH 12Z. CEILINGS WILL REMAIN HIGH (AROUND 7KFT) ENOUGH AT 
ALL TAF SITES TO KEEP VFR CONDITIONS.

THE UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE AREA TODAY WITH 
GENERALLY CLEAR SKY. ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE GREAT LAKES

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE 
CAROLINAS AND THE DEEP SOUTH...WITH A SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH A LARGE CUT-OFF UPPER- 
LEVEL LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS SURFACE TROUGH IS 
PROGGED TO SLOWLY ROTATE EASTWARD TOWARDS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...GENERATING A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WITH IT. A 
STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY OVER THE UPPER 
MS RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY...WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY PUSH THIS UPPER 
LOW EASTWARD AND WILL ALSO PUSH A STRONG COLD FRONT INTO THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY NIGHT. ALTHOUGH MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO BE 
LIMITED WITH THIS COLD FRONT...WILL PLAN TO KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
A FEW SHOWERS ON THURSDAY NIGHT OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. THE UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN THEN BECOMES HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
BY FRIDAY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION...WITH THE GFS AND NAM 
MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A FEW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST 
TN. UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY 
FRIDAY NIGHT BEHIND THE PASSAGE OF THIS COLD FRONT. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...BASICALLY WENT WITH AN 
ECMWF/GFS COMBO CONCERNING THE EXTENDED FORECAST. NEXT CUT OFF LOW 
SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS ON SATURDAY. MODELS INDICATE A POSSIBILITY OF SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE WRAPPING AROUND THIS FEATURE 
GENERATING A SHOWER OR TWO ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND A SMALL PART OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU NEAR THE 
TENNESSEE BORDER ON SATURDAY SO ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER 
HERE. THE LOW AMBLES EAST LATER SUNDAY INTO MONDAY MAKING ROOM IN 
THE FORECAST FOR DRY WEATHER THROUGH MID WEEK AS AN UPPER RIDGE 
AMPLIFIES FROM THE CENTER OF THE NATION INTO THE EASTERN STATES. THE 
BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD (SATURDAY AND SUNDAY) WILL BE RATHER COOL AS 
CHILLY CANADIAN AIR STREAMS SOUTH BEHIND THE DEPARTING UPPER LOW. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOUT TEN TO FIFTEEN DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR 
EARLY OCTOBER. MAX TEMPERATURES START TO MODERATE ON MONDAY AND BY 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...HIGHS SHOULD BE BACK IN THE NORMAL RANGE. 
LOW TEMPS WILL TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO RETURN TO NORMAL DUE TO 
EFFICIENT RADIATION IN THE DRY AIR AND LIGHT WIND REGIME.

.AVIATION...AS USUAL THE MIDWEST UPPER LOW IS DRIVING THE REGION'S
WEATHER TODAY. MOSTLY SCATTERED CU BUT FORECAST SOME BKN CU AT TRI.
SHORT WAVE ROTATING AROUND THIS FEATURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT GENERATING SCT-BKN CU
AND ALTO CU LAYERS. THERE COULD EVEN BE A SPRINKLE AT TRI WHERE
LIFT STRONGER AND MOISTURE A LITTLE DEEPER. PROBABILITY OF A SHOWER NOT
TOO HIGH THOUGH SO DID NOT MENTION. BELIEVE THE PRESSURE GRADIENT
WILL BE ENOUGH TO KEEP SOME SURFACE FLOW GOING MOST OF THE AREA
TONIGHT SO AM BANKING ON BETTER VISIBILITY IN FOG THAN WHAT
OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING. THE WAVE DEPARTS PRIOR TO DAYBREAK
THURSDAY SO ALLOWED FOR VFR FLIGHT AROUND 13-14Z AFTER THE FOG

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PESKY UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO SWIRL 
OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND IS PROJECTED TO CONTINUE TO DO SO 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. MODELS AND SREF HAVE BECOME LESS IMPRESSIVE 
WITH RESPECT TO PRECIP CHANCES FOR TODAY AS MOISTURE IS MAINLY 
CONFINED TO A SHALLOW NEAR-SURFACE LAYER PER TIME HEIGHTS. THUS HAVE 
LOWERED POPS IN MOST AREAS EXCEPT FOR FAR NORTHERN PLATEAU. 
CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE CWA 
FOR TONIGHT AS MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE SOMEWHAT. FOR TEMPS...MODEL 
GUIDANCE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT AND APPEARS REASONABLE. GENERALLY 
FOLLOWED THOSE VALUES CLOSELY.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL 
FINALLY GET PICKED UP BY NRN STREAM SHORTWAVES ON THURSDAY. ENERGY 
DROPPING INTO THE BASE OF THE TROUGH AXIS WARRANTS OUR PREVIOUS 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT FOR ALL BUT SE TN/SW NC. THE 
TROUGH DEEPENS ON FRIDAY NIGHT...AND SOME LOW LEVEL NW UPSLOPE FLOW
PLUS COLD AIR ADVECTION AT 850 MB LEVEL...WARRANTS ADDING SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR SW VA AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. I ALSO INCREASED SKY COVER 
ACROSS SW VA FOR THESE PERIODS...AND LOWERED MAX AND MIN TEMPS A FEW 
DEGREES INTO THE WEEKEND AS SOME UNSEASONABLY COOL AIR MOVES IN 
BEHIND THE EXITING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. 

SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE BUILD EASTWARD BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...ALLOWING 
TEMPS TO MODERATE BACK TO AROUND SEASONAL MAXES AND JUST BELOW 
NORMAL MINS FOR EARLY OCTOBER. DRY WEATHER ON TAP WITH LITTLE

STRAY TOO FAR.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT
AGREEMENT ON THE OVERALL PICTURE...WITH FIRST UPPER LOW FORECAST TO
LIFT NORTHEAST FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER DIVING INTO THE EASTERN US.
HOWEVER...THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS THAT LEAD TO A NO
BETTER THAN AVERAGE FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD.
WILL GENERALLY LEAN TOWARD AN 00Z ECMWF/12Z GFS BLEND FOR NOW. WITH
VICINITY OF FIRST UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH WED AND WED NIGHT WILL
HAVE TO CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH FOR SOME POSSIBLE

COUNTIES AND WRN MOST VALLEY AREAS. LIKELY POPS WEST TO CHANCE EAST 
LOOKED GOOD FOR EARLY TODAY...THEN CATEGORICAL TO LIKELY BY THIS

LIKELY FOR NE TN/SW VA UNTIL FRONTAL PASSAGE.

MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY LOOKED REASONABLE...FAVORING COOLER MOS MAXES IN 
THE WEST AND HIGHER MAXES IN THE EAST. CLOUD COVER AND LIGHT SW-W 
WINDS LED ME TO TREND TOWARD A MOS BLEND FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL BE EAST OF

MOVES EAST THURSDAY. DRIER AIR MASS MOVES INTO FORECAST AREA BEHIND
FRONT WITH ONLY A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS EARLY ACROSS NE TN AND SW

442 AM EDT SUN SEP 25 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TWO WEATHER CONCERNS THIS MORNING 
ARE...1) SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER NW NC DUE TO ESE LOW LEVEL FLOW
AND 2) LOCALLY PATCHY DENSE FOG THAT HAS DEVELOPED OVER TRI. THE
CONVECTION IS MOVING NE AT 20 MPH AND JUST SKIRTING JOHNSON/CARTER
TN AND NEAR ERN WASHINGTON COUNTY VA...SO I ADDED SOME MORNING POPS
FOR EXTREME NE TN AND OUR ERN MOST COUNTIES OF SW VA. THE FOG SEEMS
VERY LOCALIZED AND WAS NOT ADDED TO FORECAST GRIDS.

OTHERWISE...MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ARE ON THE INCREASE ON THE SRN 
END OF THE UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER W CENTRAL ILLINOIS THIS MORNING. 
NAM MODEL MOVES THE CONVECTION OUT OF AREA BEFORE THIS AFTERNOON...
AND I EXPECT PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. HIGHS MOSTLY IN THE 70S 
TO LOWER 80S LOOKS GOOD WITH MOS NUMBERS QUITE CLOSE.

FOR TONIGHT...INCREASED CLOUDS A BIT MORE FROM THE WEST...AND SPREAD 
AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EASTWARD TO COVER ALL OF OUR FORECAST 
AREA. 25/00Z MOS POPS WERE HIGHER THIS RUN AND THE NEW POP GRIDS 
MESHED BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. MIN TEMP GRID WAS ALSO 
ADJUSTED UP A FEW DEGREES DUE TO INCREASING CLOUDS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LOW EXPECTED TO BE
OVER UPPER MS VALLEY WITH SURFACE LOW ACROSS INDIANA AND COLD FRONT
EXTENDING SOUTHEAST THROUGH MIDDLE TN AND SOUTHWEST INTO LOWER MS
VALLEY AT 12Z MONDAY. INCREASING CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE FRONT MONDAY. AIR MASS WILL BE
MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY. THE FRONT WILL MOVE
THROUGH BY EARLY TUESDAY. NAM MODEL KEEPS UPPER LOW BACK OVER THE
SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WITH A CONTINUED CHANCE
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. PREFER GFS MODEL THAT MOVES UPPER
LOW OUT FASTER INTO THE EASTERN LAKES BY LATE TUESDAY. CONTINUED
CHANCE OF SHOWERS TUESDAY THEN CLEARING SKIES FROM SOUTHWEST TO
NORTHEAST TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. NW FLOW AND DRIER AIR MASS
WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY CLEAR WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. A WEAK
DRY FRONT EARLY FRIDAY WILL REINFORCE DRY AIRMASS AND BRING COOLER
TEMPERATURES TO FORECAST AREA FOR SATURDAY.

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PARTIAL CLEARING HAS OCCURRED 
OVER WRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...BUT FOG HAS BEEN 
SPOTTY DUE TO MIXING OF DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION AND LINGERING 
CLOUD COVER IN ERN AREAS. VERY LOW CLOUDS COVER MUCH OF THE PLATEAU 
NE INTO ERN KY...WHILE SLIGHTLY HIGHER LOW CLOUDS PERSIST FROM E TN 
INTO SW VA AND SW NC. TWEAKED FORECAST GRIDS TO REFLECT THESE CLOUDS 
EARLY THIS MORNING...THEN PARTLY OR MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. THE DRY AIR 
SHOULD ALLOW HIGHS TO REACH NEAR THE MILDER GFS MOS MAXES.

HIGH CLOUDS MAY INCREASE LATE TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE WOBBLING UPPER 
LOW OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION...BUT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
PATCHY FOG WILL EXIST WHERE SKIES REMAIN MOSTLY CLEAR. NAM AND GFS 
MOS DIFFER CONSIDERABLY ON HOW COOL TEMPS DROP...AND I NUDGED THE 
PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID DOWN TO AT LEAST A BLEND FOR NOW. 

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER LOW ACROSS MS VALLEY 
WILL BRING CLOUDS INTO THE TN VALLEY SUNDAY BUT POCKET OF DRY AIR 
WILL LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH PART OF THE DAY. BY 
AFTERNOON SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS PLATEAU...SW VA AND EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AS FRONTAL SYSTEM AHEAD OF UPPER LOW MOVES INTO TN VALLEY.

WARMER SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 80S. MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY CONTINUED CHANCE OF SHOWERS THOUGH DECREASING AS UPPER 
LOW ONLY SLOWLY MOVES EAST ACROSS SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES DRY AIR WILL

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT STRETCHING ALONG A LINE 
FROM NEAR LEXINGTON KY TO NASHVILLE TO TUPELO MS...WITH AREA RADARS 
REVEALING SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A 
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO LINGER OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA OVERNIGHT...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFYING OVER THE MID 
AND UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE 
BULK OF THE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE COLD FRONT WILL STAY 
WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE SUNRISE...WITH MAINLY SCATTERED 
ACTIVITY IN THE LOCAL AREA OVERNIGHT. THUS...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE 
FORECAST THIS EVENING TO MENTION SCATTERED CONVECTION OVERNIGHT... 
AND WILL MENTION SOME PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT. THINK 
THAT MORE CLOUD COVER TONIGHT SHOULD KEEP ANY FOG FROM BECOMING AS 
WIDESPREAD AS THIS MORNING. TEMPS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK AND WILL NOT 
PLAN TO CHANGE.

.AVIATION...SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING STREAM OF DEEP MOISTURE WILL
CONTINUE TO FEED OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO IN STAGNANT PATTERN
FEATURING A RETROGRADING UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE WESTERN GREAT
LAKES. THE MOIST ATMOSPHERE WILL CONTINUE TO BE LIFTED AHEAD OF A
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE WITH THE
HELP OF SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW.
DUE TO THE LIMITATIONS OF THE TAF GENERALLY BROADBRUSHED SOME
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE NEXT SIX HOURS.
WAS ABLE TO USE A PREVAILING PERIOD FOR CHA WHERE A FEW SHOWERS AND
SOME THUNDER MAY OCCUR THROUGH 02Z FRI. DENSE FOG DEVELOPED
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. CERTAINLY ENOUGH MOIST AIR NEAR THE SURFACE FOR
SATURATED CONDITIONS TONIGHT SO USED SOME IFR FOG EVERYWHERE...AND
EVEN A BIT OF LIFR CEILING FOR TRI TOWARD DAYBREAK. MODELS TRY TO
BRING ANOTHER SHORTWAVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON FRIDAY.
SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES APPARENT BUT SOME IMPROVEMENT IN FLIGHT
CONDITIONS MAY OCCUR AT CHA AFTER 20Z WITH THUNDER ENDING FROM WEST
TO EAST ALONG FRONTAL BOUNDARY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD FRONT REMAINS WEST OF 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS EVENING. RELATIVELY HIGH DEW POINTS 
ACROSS THE AREA EAST OF THE FRONT. THE AIRMASS HAS DESTABILIZED THIS 
AFTERNOON. SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS.
LEANED TOWARD WARMER OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES EXPECTING FRONT TO CROSS 
THE PLATEAU LATE. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT INCREASES TONIGHT AND FRIDAY
AS CUTTING OFF UPPER LOW DROPS TO NEAR CHICAGO. INCREASED FLOW WILL 
HELP PUSH COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA EARLY FRIDAY. GOOD CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION FRIDAY BUT BETTER COVERAGE EXPECTED IN MORE UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS AND ALSO POST FRONTAL NW OF THE AREA 
ASSOCIATED WITH STRONGER UPPER JET AND LIFT. DEW POINTS BEGIN TO 
FALL FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND CONTINUE TO DROP THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
AIRMASS DRIES OUT FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES NEAR 
NORMAL.   

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL LOW 
TRACKS TO THE NORTH ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...STILL SOME 
UNCERTAINTY ON THE CENTER. FOLLOWED THE GFS FOR NOW WHICH WOULD KEEP 
THE ACTIVITY NORTH OF THE CWA. SO KEEP ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
SUNDAY. A FRONT TRACKS INTO THE AREA ON THE MONDAY AND TUESDAY TIME 
FRAME. KEPT THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR MONDAY WHEN THE DEEPEST MOISTURE 
ARRIVES. DRIER WEATHER RETURNING ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. STAYED 
NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AHEAD OF AN ADVANCING COLD FRONT 
...THE AIR MASS REMAINS MOIST AND MARGINALLY UNSTABLE.  THIS WILL 
ALLOW ISOLATED SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A STRAY THUNDERSTORM TO DEVELOP 
OVER THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON.  BEST CHANCE FOR CONVECTION WILL BE 
OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND ACROSS NORTHERN LOCATIONS WHERE A 
WEAK IMPULSE IS EXPECTED TO SLIDE THROUGH.  CHANCES INCREASES 
OVERNIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL LOW IS MAIN 
WEATHER FEATURE FOR THE LONG TERM...BUT UNFORTUNATELY...AS IS OFTEN 
THE CASE WITH UPPER LOWS...UNCERTAINTY ABOUT WHERE IT WILL TRACK IS 
HIGH GIVEN VERY POOR MODEL AGREEMENT AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY.  IT 
DOES APPEAR THAT THE CENTER WILL TRACK TO OUR NORTH...WHICH USUALLY 
RESULTS IN LESS PRECIP FOR US.  WILL TRY TO AVOID BIG SWINGS IN THE 
FORECAST...AND WILL MAKE ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO POPS THIS 
PACKAGE.  RESULT WILL BE CHANCE POPS SOUTH TO LIKELY NORTHEAST FOR 
FRIDAY...DRY SATURDAY...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS SUNDAY 
INTO MONDAY AND SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH TUESDAY. NOT MUCH ARGUMENT WITH 
MAV TEMPS FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...BUT WILL TRIM MEX TEMPS SOMEWHAT

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A MINOR DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE 
ALONG A DISSIPATING WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY STRETCHED ACROSS THE 
REGION TODAY.  THIS WILL PROVIDE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY AN 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM ACROSS THE MRX CWA.  THE DISTURBANCE WILL LIFT 
NORTH OF THE AREA THIS EVENING...DIMINISHING SHOWER ACTIVITY FROM SOUTH TO 
NORTH.  A FEW RESIDUAL SHOWERS MAY LINGER OVERNIGHT BUT COVERAGE 
SHOULD BE LIMITED.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
FOR LARGER SCALE PATTERN FOR THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH STILL SOME 
DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS.  UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
AT THE START OF THE PERIOD IS FORECAST TO MAKE AN UNSTEADY DECENT 
TOWARD OUR AREA.  ONE AREA OF UNCERTAINTY IS HOW FAR SOUTH THIS LOW 
DESCENDS...WITH THE ECMWF SHOWING MORE SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT THAN THE 
GFS/CMC.  WILL LEAN TOWARD A BLEND FOR NOW AND KEEP THE CENTER TO 
OUR NORTH.  ASSUMING THE LOW STAYS CENTERED TO OUR NORTH...WE SHOULD 
NOT BE OVERLY WET...BUT WILL HAVE TO KEEP POPS IN THE FORECAST MOST 
PERIODS.  WILL CARRY CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EXCEPT SAT/SAT 
NIGHT...WHEN MODELS CONTINUE TO AGREE WE SHOULD HAVE DRIER AIR OVER 
THE AREA. BY TUESDAY ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH ZONES AS UPPER 
LOW STARTS TO PULL AWAY.  WILL NOT ARGUE MUCH WITH GFS MOS

.DISCUSSION...CONVECTION OVER NE AL AND SRN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU HAS 
DIMINISHED...BUT DOES CONTINUE ALONG AND SOUTH OF I-20 OVER CENTRAL 
GA. UPPER AIR PLOTS FROM 21/00Z SHOW A RATHER WEAK SE JET AT 850 
MBS AT BMX AND FFC...AND LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING IS ALSO A NEGATIVE 
FACTOR FOR MORE CONVECTION OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...A SPEED/JET MAX AT 
300-500 MBS MAY MOVE INTO THE REGION TOWARD DYABREAK...AND WOULD 
PLACE LEFT FRONT QUAD NEAR SRN APPALACHIANS.

PLAN NOW IS TO ONLY CARRY LIKELY POPS REST OF THE NIGHT FOR SE TN 
AND SW NC AREAS...AND TO REMOVE THE MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS. I WILL 
CARRY HIGH CHANCE FOR SMOKIES...CENTRAL VALLEY AND NRN PLATEAU...
WITH LESSER CHANCE FOR SW VA AND NE TN.

PLATEAU FROM NRN AL AT THIS TIME. THERE IS LIGHTNING NOTED SOUTH OF 
I-20...BUT I EXPECT MOSTLY SHOWERS FOR OUR FORECAST AREA. CHA WILL 
BE FIRST TAF SITE AFFECTED...WITH CONDITIONS TRENDING DOWN TO 
BETWEEN MVFR AND IFR OVERNIGHT. SHOWERS AND LOWERING CONDITIONS

SHOWERS AND MVFR CONDITIONS SOME FOR TRI.

SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO LINGER FOR MOST OF WEDNESDAY...BUT 
CONDITIONS SHOULD IMPROVE A BIT IN THE AFTERNOON.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES COVER THE 
FOUR STATE REGION THIS AFTERNOON WITH A FEW MORE BREAKS FROM 
KNOXVILLE NE INTO SW VIRGINIA. SINCE THE EARLY MORNING HOURS MOST OF 
THE RAIN WHICH HAS BEEN VERY LIGHT AND ISOLATED HAS OCCURRED OVER SE 
TN. TEMPERATURES FAIRLY UNIFORM IN THE 60S SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND 
HIGHER MOUNTAINS TO 70S VALLEYS. A LITTLE MORE SUN THAN EXPECTED 
RAISED TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES HIGHER. FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
A WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREA ALONG DISSIPATING FRONT OVER MS AND WEST TN 
COMBINED WITH UPPER LEVEL IMPULSE NOW OVER NORTH AL BECOMES MORE 
DEVELOPED TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS IT MOVES NE INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA. HAVE INCREASED POPS GOING INTO TONIGHT AND TOMORROW TO LIKELY 
TO ABOUT 80 PERCENT. DURING THE AFTERNOON WEDNESDAY SHOWERS SHOULD 
DECREASE DURING THE AFTERNOON. ACTIVITY MAY DEVELOP TO WEST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA LATE WEDNESDAY AS AN UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH OVER THE 
PLAINS STATES WITH CLOSED OFF UPPER LOW MOVING INTO THE WESTERN 
GREAT LAKES. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO MIDDLE TN BY 00Z THU. 
INSTABILITY VERY LOW RIGHT NOW BUT SHOULD INCREASE A LITTLE AS 
IMPULSE MOVES NE TONIGHT. WEDNESDAY WILL CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS 
HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC PATTERN THROUGH

EARLY NEXT WEEK. A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE SLOWLY EASTWARD

UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BECOMES HIGHLY AMPLIFIED OVER THE MS RIVER 
VALLEY. MODELS AGREE THAT SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE MAP HAS A 
COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE MS AND LOWER OHIO VALLEY WITH AN AREA OF 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER MIDDLE TN THESE SHOWERS HAVE BEEN MOVING 
SLOWLY EAST DURING THE DAY. SKIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY CLOUDY ACROSS

TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN TO THE UPPER 60S TO MID 70S. FOR TONIGHT AND

STRONGER SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. SHORTWAVE ENERGY 
WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH LIGHT RAIN 
SHOWERS BECOMING MORE NUMEROUS BY THIS EVENING AND CONTINUING 
OVERNIGHT INTO TUESDAY BUT DECREASING CHANCES IN THE AFTERNOON. HAVE 
INCREASED RAIN CHANCES TO LIKELY LATE TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING 
AND INCREASED POPS TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO CHANCE. INSTABILITY WILL BE 
MARGINAL INTO THIS EVENING AND TUESDAY BUT WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE 
OF THUNDERSTORMS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT. HAVE LOWERED HIGHS 
A FEW DEGREES TUESDAY DUE TO CLOUDS AND SHOWERS. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS SHOW AIRMASS 
BECOMING MARGINALLY UNSTABLE FOR TUESDAY NIGHT WITH DIURNALLY DRIVEN
CONVECTION ANTICIPATED DURING THE EVENING.  FOR WEDNESDAY...A SLOW
MOVING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY PRODUCING 
LIKELY CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AIRMASS WILL BE 
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE...BUT DO NOT SEE A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM CONCERN.

THIS FRONT BECOMES QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY OVER THE EASTERN COUNTIES.

FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED...MAINLY FORECAST CONCERN WILL BE HOW 
DEEP/LOCATION OF UPPER TROUGH DROPPING INTO THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE 
VALLEYS. THERE ARE SOME FAIRLY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS BETWEEN THE GFS 
AND ECMWF.  THE ECMWF WANTS TO CUT-OFF THE UPPER LOW NEAR THE AREA 
WHILE THE GFS KEEPS THE CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES. 
WILL TREND FORECAST TOWARD THE GFS SOLUTION...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW 
GIVEN THE LARGE SPREAD IN THE ENSEMBLE SOLUTIONS.

WILL KEEP BEST CHANCES OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA FOR LATER HALF OF THE WEEK/EARLY NEXT WEEK DUE TO 
CLOSER PROXIMITY TO THE UPPER LOW.

VALLEYS. THERE ARE SOME FAIRLY DIFFERENT SOLUTIONS BETWEEN THE GFS 
AND ECMWF.  THE ECMWF WANTS TO CUT-OFF THE UPPER LOW NEAR THE AREA 
WHILE THE GFS KEEPS THE CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES. 
WILL TREND FORECAST TOWARD THE GFS SOLUTION...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW 
GIVEN THE LARGE SPREAD IN THE ENSEMBLE SOLUTIONS.

WILL KEEP BEST CHANCES OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA FOR LATER HALF OF THE WEEK/EARLY NEXT WEEK DUE TO 
CLOSER PROXIMITY TO THE UPPER LOW.

AFTERNOON AFD RESENT PER MEDIA REQUEST...

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT WILL 
APPROACH THE AREA DURING THE PERIOD.  MOISTURE WILL INCREASE OVER 
THE AREA...AND SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL ENHANCE PRECIP CHANCES 
LATE TODAY INTO TONIGHT WITH BEST CHANCES ACROSS WEST AND NORTH 
ZONES WHERE WILL CARRY LOW LIKELY POPS.   CONVECTIVE ENERGY LOOKS 
LIMITED AT BEST...SO WILL ONLY MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE THUNDER. MAV 
TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS.      

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE GFS FOR 
THE EXTENDED WHICH SEEMED TO BE A LITTLE MORE REALISTIC WITH BETTER 
DETAIL TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THE ECMWF BROAD BRUSHES QPF ESPECIALLY 
ON TUESDAY WHERE POPS APPEAR TO BE A TAD TOO HIGH WITH DEPARTURE OF 
WEAKENING SHORT WAVE AND WEAK FRONT STALLED WEST OF THE REGION. BY 
WEDNESDAY MODELS INDICATE INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION AND 
INSTABILITY ALONG WITH SLOWLY STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE 
AHEAD OF DEEPENING GREAT LAKES LONG WAVE TROUGH. HOWEVER STILL 
ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY HERE TO KEEP PROBABILITY OF PRECIP FOR SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS IN A MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE CATEGORY. BETTER CHANCE 
FOR CONVECTION OCCURS LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY NIGHT AS 
DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BUILDS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. RAISED POPS TO LIKELY FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AS 
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT PRESS EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY THE UPPER TROUGH LUMBERS VERY 
SLOWLY EAST WITH UPPER LOW FORMING IN THE VICINITY OF THE UPPER OHIO 
VALLEY AND EASTERN LAKES. QUITE A BIT OF MOISTURE CONTINUES TO WRAP 
AROUND THE UPPER LEVEL FEATURE AND KEPT THE SLIGHT THROUGH MEDIUM 
CHANCE POP FOR A SHOWER GOING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY 
WHILE DROPPING FRIDAY NIGHT AS SOME DRIER AIR ADVECTS INTO THE 
REGION. MODELS TRY TO KEEP THE CUT OFF LOW AROUND THE UPPER OHIO 
VALLEY THROUGH SUNDAY BUT DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME JUST 
MAINTAINED THE CURRENT DRY FORECAST. CONCERNING TEMPS EDGED TOWARD 
THE WARMER MAXES ON TUESDAY WHILE EDGING SLIGHTLY BELOW SUGGESTED 
HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH A BETTER CHANCE FOR PRECIP EACH 
DAY. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO MEX MOS TEMPS FOR THE REMAINDER OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOISTURE WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE 
AHEAD OF WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH.  SHOULD SEE VARYING AMOUNTS OF 
CLOUDS DURING THE PERIOD...BUT SHOULD BE MAINLY DRY.  WILL ONLY 
INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS LATE TONIGHT FOR PLATEAU COUNTIES 
AS SYSTEM APPROACHES.  MAV TEMPS LOOK A BIT HIGH FOR MAX TEMPS 
TODAY...SO WILL LEAN MORE TOWARD A MAV/MET BLEND. MAV TEMPS FOR 
TONIGHT LOOK REASONABLE SO NOT MUCH ARGUMENT THERE.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD ALTHOUGH A LITTLE DIVERGENCE OF OPINION 
BY DAYS SIX AND SEVEN. THE SCENARIO BASICALLY REMAINS WITH WEAKENING 
UPPER TROUGH DRAGGING A COLD FRONT SLOWLY TOWARD THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT WITH SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
DRIVING EAST ACROSS THE REGION BY 12Z TUESDAY. KEPT THE WEST THROUGH 
EAST POP GRADIENT IDEA GOING MONDAY WITH HIGHEST POPS WEST WHILE 
TWEAKING UP SLIGHTLY AREA WIDE FOR MONDAY NIGHT AS WEAK BOUNDARY 
TRIES TO EDGE CLOSER TO THE FORECAST AREA. BEST CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION WOULD BE OVER THE WESTERN HALF DURING THIS PERIOD. THE 
WEAK BOUNDARY STALLS SOMEWHERE ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND TRIED TO 
KEEP THE POPS A LITTLE LOWER ON TUESDAY AS AREA AWAITS DEEPER LONG 
WAVE TROUGH WHICH DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO 
THE GREAT LAKES AND MIDWEST WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. MODELS MORE 
ROBUST WITH MOISTURE ADVECTION/INSTABILITY WITH THIS SYSTEM AND 
ADJUSTED POPS FROM 40 PERCENT ON WEDNESDAY TO 50 PERCENT LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS SYSTEM COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. SHOULD BE A BETTER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION AREA WIDE 
WITH THIS BOUNDARY. MODEL SOLUTIONS START TO DIVERGE THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY AS JET ENERGY FILLS IN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE UPPER TROUGH 
WHICH SHOULD END UP SLOWING DOWN FRONTAL BOUNDARY. WITH UNCERTAINTY 
BUILDING DURING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST JUST GRADUALLY DROPPED 
POPS BACK TO MEDIUM CHANCE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. BY FRIDAY MODELS 
COMING MORE INTO AGREEMENT ON A MIDWEST CUT OFF LOW DEVELOPING 
PROVIDING A BETTER CHANCE FOR AN UNSETTLED WEATHER LATE IN THE WEEK. 
THEREFORE USED A SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE POP WITH SHOWERS POSSIBLE 
AS SHORT WAVE FEATURES ROTATE AROUND THE UPPER LOW. POSSIBILITY 
EXISTS FOR A FEW MORE SHOWERS ON SATURDAY IN THIS PATTERN BUT KEPT 
OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR NOW. TRIED TO ADJUST MAX/MIN TEMPS A LITTLE 
HIGHER THROUGH MID WEEK WITH PERSISTENT SOUTHERLY FLOW AND HIGHER 
DEWPOINTS AVAILABLE FOR TEMPERATURE MODERATION AT NIGHT.

MID SOUTH CONTINUES THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD WITH VERY LOW CHANCE OF
ANYTHING MORE THAN A SPRINKLE. PLACED A SPRINKLE IN TRI FORECAST
EARLY IN THE PERIOD WHERE TAIL END OF INITIAL WEAK SHORT WAVE
FEATURE MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. ANOTHER WAVE BUILDS
ACROSS THE TERMINALS TONIGHT WITH A SMALL POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER
SPRINKLE. VFR CEILINGS MAY HANG AROUND THROUGH SUNDAY. PERHAPS THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...A WEAK UPPER LEVEL

THIS MORNING. MODELS SHOW WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT...WHICH IS HELPING TO
ALREADY PRODUCE SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS/SPRINKLES. FEEL CHANCE OF 
MEASURABLE RAINFALL IS LOW DUE TO RELATIVELY DRY AIRMASS...SO WILL 
CALL FOR SCATTERED SPRINKLES. THIS WAVE EXITS THE AREA BY

BESIDES THE WEAK WAVE...SURFACE RIDGING WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH SUNDAY. RETURN 
FLOW OF SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL INTRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF

THE FORECAST AREA STALLING OR WASHING OUT ON TUESDAY. TWEAKED POPS 
UP TO LOW AND MEDIUM CHANCE FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS

AMPLIFYING INTO A CLOSED LOW. MORE ROBUST SURFACE COLD FRONT SHOULD 
ACCOMPANY THIS TROF AND MAINTAINED A GRADUAL INCREASE IN POPS 
WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR A BETTER CHANCE FOR

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BUILD/WEDGE SOUTH EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS TODAY AND
TONIGHT WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE PLATEAU. THE WEDGE OF
COOLER AIR WILL PULL LOW CLOUDS AND SOME LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE INTO
THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHAINS. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN
OVER THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST
NORTH CAROLINA. LOW CLOUDS FROM THE COOLER WEDGE WILL PULL INTO THE
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND PLATEAU LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT. 

ELSEWHERE...A WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE MOVING FROM THE NORTHERN
PLAINS TO THE GREAT LAKES WILL PULL A GOOD DEAL OF HIGH/MID LEVEL
CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA LATER TODAY AND OVERNIGHT. MOISTURE IS QUITE
LIMITED SO WILL KEEP VALLEY AND PLATEAU DRY.

FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...UPPER DISTRUBANCE PULLS EAST
TOWARD THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH CLOUDS DECREASING.
GENERALLY COMPROMISED BETWEEN GFS/MET MOS NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES 
SOUTHWESTERLY BY SUNDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MAKES ITS WAY 
STEADILY EAST FROM THE PLAINS AND ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. THE TROUGH 
DEAMPLIFIES AS IT MOVES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN STATES AROUND 12Z 
TUESDAY. DURING THIS PERIOD THE LOW LEVEL FLOW GRADUALLY SHIFTS TO A 
MORE SOUTHERLY DIRECTION WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE 
ADVECTION AHEAD OF A WEAKENING COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY WHICH BARELY 
MAKES IT TO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY TUESDAY EVENING. KEPT POPS AT 
SLIGHT CHANCE IN THIS SCENARIO WHILE THE FORECAST AREA AWAITS A 
STRONGER SYSTEM WHICH AMPLIFIES AS IT DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF 
MANITOBA ON TUESDAY AND INTO THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH MID WEEK. A 
STRONGER FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL ACCOMPANY THIS FEATURE WHICH WILL 
RESULT IN HIGHER PROBABILITY FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY 
INTO THURSDAY. AT THIS TIME PLACED THE HIGHEST CHANCE POPS IN THE 
PERIOD FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FRONTAL 
TIMING SOMEWHAT IN QUESTION AT THIS REMOTE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST SO 
MAINTAINED THE BROAD BRUSHED LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR THURSDAY 
DECREASING TO SLIGHT CHANCE BY THURSDAY NIGHT. TWEAKED MAX/MIN TEMPS

CHALLENGE FOR THE TONIGHT PERIOD. APPEARS CAP WILL HOLD STRONG 
OVERNIGHT TRAPPING CLOUDS MOST AREAS. LEANED TOWARD A CLOUDIER 
SOLUTION. COLD AIR ADVECTION UNDERWAY AND TEMPERATURES IN THE 40S 
WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE MRX CWA. SON  

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA IS MARKED BY A THIN LINE OF LIGHT RAIN 
SHOWERS FROM AROUND TRI TO EAST OF TYS. EXPECT THAT THE FRONT AND 
MOST OF RAIN SHOWERS WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA BY 00Z...SO WILL CARRY 
NO POPS OVERNIGHT BUT WILL MENTION SOME PATCHY DRIZZLE NORTH IN THE 
EVENING. THE BACK EDGE OF CLOUDS ACROSS CENTRAL KY AND WEST TN WILL 
ENTER THE AREA IN THE EVENING...SO A PERIOD OF CLEARING IS EXPECTED 
TOWARD MIDNIGHT. THIS WILL HELP TEMPERATURES DROP INTO THE 50S WITH 
SOME UPPER 40S NORTH AS LOWER DEWPOINTS ADVECT SOUTHWARD. MIXING 
FROM GRADIENT WINDS SHOULD KEEP TEMPS FROM GOING MUCH LOWER AND 
PREVENT FOG DEVELOPMENT. 

LATE TONIGHT A SOUTHEASTERLY 850 MB FLOW DEVELOPS ACROSS 
SC/GA...WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT AND AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH BRINGING 
INCREASING CLOUDS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ACROSS THE TN VALLEY TOMORROW 
MORNING. MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE CONFINED TO A THIN LAYER AROUND 850 
MB WITH DRY AIR ABOVE...SO NO PRECIP IS EXPECTED UNDER CLOUDY SKIES. 
THE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND COOL AIR MASS IN PLACE BEHIND THE 
FRONT SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL...AND ON THE COOL 
SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE...WITH HIGHS IN THE 60S TO LOWER 70S. 

LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
INVERTED TROUGH REMAINS ACROSS THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
SO CLOUD COVER WILL LINGER AND THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS MAINLY EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA HIGHER CHANCE 
MOUNTAINS. NAM MODEL MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN MAV WITH CLOUD 
COVER...CHANCE POPS AND COOL TEMPERATURES SATURDAY. SHORT RANGE 
ENSEMBLE MODELS MOVE TROUGH OUT SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL FOLLOW COOLER 
MAV GUIDANCE FRIDAY NIGHT AND GENERALLY A BLEND SATURDAY. HIGHER 
PRESSURE OVER THE NE STATES WILL EXTEND DOWN INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MOST OF MONDAY. A SLOW MOVING FRONTAL SYSTEM 
WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA LATE MONDAY OR MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO THURSDAY AS IT MOVES FROM THE PLAINS AND THE GREAT LAKES INTO 
THE TN VALLEY. THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL

A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA IS MARKED BY A THIN LINE OF LIGHT RAIN 
SHOWERS FROM AROUND TRI TO EAST OF TYS. EXPECT THAT THE FRONT AND 
MOST OF RAIN SHOWERS WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA BY 00Z...SO WILL CARRY 
NO POPS OVERNIGHT BUT WILL MENTION SOME PATCHY DRIZZLE NORTH IN THE 
EVENING. THE BACK EDGE OF CLOUDS ACROSS CENTRAL KY AND WEST TN WILL 
ENTER THE AREA IN THE EVENING...SO A PERIOD OF CLEARING IS EXPECTED 
TOWARD MIDNIGHT. THIS WILL HELP TEMPERATURES DROP INTO THE 50S WITH 
SOME UPPER 40S NORTH AS LOWER DEWPOINTS ADVECT SOUTHWARD. MIXING 
FROM GRADIENT WINDS SHOULD KEEP TEMPS FROM GOING MUCH LOWER AND 
PREVENT FOG DEVELOPMENT. 

LATE TONIGHT A SOUTHEASTERLY 850 MB FLOW DEVELOPS ACROSS 
SC/GA...WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT AND AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH BRINGING 
INCREASING CLOUDS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ACROSS THE TN VALLEY TOMORROW 
MORNING. MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE CONFINED TO A THIN LAYER AROUND 850 
MB WITH DRY AIR ABOVE...SO NO PRECIP IS EXPECTED UNDER CLOUDY SKIES. 
THE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND COOL AIR MASS IN PLACE BEHIND THE 
FRONT SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL...AND ON THE COOL 
SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE...WITH HIGHS IN THE 60S TO LOWER 70S. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
INVERTED TROUGH REMAINS ACROSS THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
SO CLOUD COVER WILL LINGER AND THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS MAINLY EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA HIGHER CHANCE 
MOUNTAINS. NAM MODEL MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN MAV WITH CLOUD 
COVER...CHANCE POPS AND COOL TEMPERATURES SATURDAY. SHORT RANGE 
ENSEMBLE MODELS MOVE TROUGH OUT SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL FOLLOW COOLER 
MAV GUIDANCE FRIDAY NIGHT AND GENERALLY A BLEND SATURDAY. HIGHER 
PRESSURE OVER THE NE STATES WILL EXTEND DOWN INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MOST OF MONDAY. A SLOW MOVING FRONTAL SYSTEM 
WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA LATE MONDAY OR MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO THURSDAY AS IT MOVES FROM THE PLAINS AND THE GREAT LAKES INTO 
THE TN VALLEY. THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL 
AFTER THE WEEKEND.

.AVIATION...
A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE AREA IS BRINGING A NORTHERLY WIND
AND MVFR CEILINGS ACROSS THE AREA. EXPECT MVFR CONDITIONS WITH
NORTH WINDS ABOVE 10 KTS TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.
SATELLITE SHOWS A SHARP BACK EDGE OF THE CLOUDS ACROSS CENTRAL KY
AND WEST TN...WHICH SHOULD MOVE INTO THE AREA AROUND 00Z...WITH VFR
CONDITIONS RETURNING. LATE TONIGHT A SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW DEVELOPS
FROM JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE TO AROUND 5 KFT. THIS WILL ADVECT
ADDITIONAL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA BY MORNING...WITH BROKEN TO

.DISCUSSION...
A COLD FRONT IS PUSHING THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING...AND IS
CURRENTLY LOCATED NEAR THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.
SHOWERS ARE ALL TO THE EAST OF THE FRONT...WITH LOW CEILINGS BEHIND
IT. THE 12Z 0HX SOUNDING INDICATES MOISTURE IS CONFINED BELOW 800
MB. THE LACK OF PRECIP BEHIND THE FRONT WILL MEAN THAT POPS CAN BE
LOWERED FASTER THAN CURRENTLY FORECAST. OVERCAST CLOUDS AND COLD
ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT WILL MEAN TEMPS WILL NOT RISE MUCH ABOVE
CURRENT VALUES...AND MAY FALL A BIT THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. WILL
MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO POPS AND TEMPS FOR THE MORNING UPDATE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD FRONT TRACKING THROUGH AREA
EARLY TODAY SO KEPT THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE MORNING AND EARLY
AFTERNOON. MODELS STILL INDICATING SOME INSTABILITY DURING THE MORNING
HOURS SO WILL LEAVE THE THUNDER IN THE FORECAST FOR EARLY TODAY. NO
SEVERE WEATHER IS EXPECTED TODAY. COOLER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED
TODAY AND TONIGHT AS THE FRONT EXITS THE REGION TONIGHT. IT SHOULD
BE MAINLY DRY TONIGHT...BUT WITH SOME LINGERING MOISTURE IN THE
MOUNTAINS...WILL CONTINUE WITH LOW POPS FOR THOSE AREAS. GUIDANCE
TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT CONTINUE TO SHOW DIFFERENCES WITH THE AMOUNT 
OF MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR FRIDAY 
AND SATURDAY. OVERALL...IT APPEARS THAT AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH 
WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT 
PRODUCING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND LIGHT STRATIFORM RAIN. LOW CHANCE 
POPS FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT APPEAR GOOD...SINCE THE MODELS 
AGREE THAT ANY PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL BE VERY LIGHT AND SCATTERED. A 
SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW WILL THEN DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY 
SUNDAY...AS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHEAST DRIFTS 
EASTWARD. MODELS INDICATE THAT MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA EACH AFTERNOON BEGINNING ON SUNDAY...WITH 
SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION EXPECTED TO DEVELOP EACH AFTERNOON OVER THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. THIS CONVECTION WILL THEN BECOME POSSIBLE AREAWIDE 
BY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACHES 
THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. MADE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO NEAR TERM
DEW POINTS. CONVECTION SHOULD WEAKEN OVERNIGHT WHILE MOVING INTO THE 
AREA FROM THE WEST. OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN UP IN THE 
PRE-FRONTAL AIRMASS. SON

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA TODAY WILL GIVE WAY TO A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM TRACKING ACROSS TN OVERNIGHT. CONVECTION NOW CROSSING WEST TN 
WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EAST AND DAYTIME HEATING IS LOST. 
500 MB VORTICITY AND 850 MB CONVERGENCE WILL PROVIDE THE BEST LIFT 
ACROSS EAST TN AROUND THE 09-12Z TIME FRAME. THERE IS SOME WEAK 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY...SO WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS ALONG WITH LIKELY POPS. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE 
PRECIP IS CLOSELY ALIGNED WITH THE SURFACE FRONT...SO POPS WILL 
BEGIN TO DECREASE FROM WEST TO EAST WITH THE FROPA THURSDAY MORNING. 
HOWEVER PLENTY OF SHALLOW LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS IN PLACE BEHIND 
THE FRONT...AS WE ARE CURRENTLY SEEING ACROSS MO/IL. THIS SHOULD 
GIVE A MOSTLY CLOUDY DAY ON THURSDAY...WITH TEMPERATURES ON THE LOW 
SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE IN THE MID 60S TO MID 70S IN MOST SPOTS. SOME 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS MAY COME IN THE LATE AFTERNOON AND IN SOUTHERN 
AREAS. GUSTY NORTH WINDS CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED BEHIND THE FRONT 
TOMORROW...WITH GUSTS IN THE 20-30 MPH RANGE.  

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THIS PERIOD STARTS 
WITH THE EVER-PERSISTENT RIDGE TO OUR SOUTH...OVER THE GULF...AND 
THE GREAT LAKES TROUGH EXITING TO THE EAST...RESULTING IN A ZONAL 
FLOW ACROSS THE AREA. A POST-FRONTAL SURFACE RIDGE IS BUILDING INTO 
THE AREA...FROM A HIGH CENTERED IN THE NORTH-CENTRAL U.S.  
HOWEVER...THE INFLUENCE FROM THE HIGH IS CHALLENGED BY A DEVELOPING 
INVERTED/LEE TROUGH OVER THE AREA...AS DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE ALONG 
THE GULF INDUCES EASTERLY DOWNSLOPING WINDS OFF THE 
APPALACHIANS...AND FURTHER DEVELOPS THE LEE THE TROUGH OVER THE 
UPPER TN VALLEY...WHICH DRAWS MOISTURE VERY QUICKLY BACK INTO THE 
AREA. FOR PRECIP CHANCES...PRETTY LOW EXCEPT OVER THE HIGHEST 
ELEVATIONS...BUT ELSEWHERE MOISTURE LOOKS LIKE IT IS NOT DEEP ENOUGH 
TO GIVE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT TO MEASURABLE PRECIP...SO DRY TO LOW 
POPS THROUGH FRIDAY.

AS THE GREAT LAKES TROUGH GETS FARTHER AWAY...ONE MORE SHORTWAVE 
RACES ACROSS FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY STAYS TO OUR 
NORTH.  HAVE GOOD COVERAGE OF LOW POPS FRIDAY NIGHT.

OVER THE WEEKEND...THE GULF RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA ALOFT AND 
TRIMMED BACK POPS EVEN MORE AND SUBSIDENCE ERODES MOISTURE FROM 
ABOVE...FOR SATURDAY ONLY HAVE POPS IN HIGHER TERRAIN IN THE EAST.  
THEN TURNING DRY ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH MONDAY.

EARLY NEXT WEEK...HEIGHTS OVER THE AREA START TO FALL AS THE 
NEXT GREAT LAKES TROUGH AND A SHORT WAVE FROM THE NORTHERN ROCKIES 
COME INTO PHASE AND BUILD A TROUGH INTO THE GULF...THEREBY SHUNTING 
THE UPPER RIDGE INTO THE DESERT SOUTHWEST.  NO FRONTAL PASSAGES 
THROUGH NEXT WEDNESDAY...BUT MODELS SHOW A SHORTWAVE HEADED TOWARD 
THE AREA...AND WOULD NOT DOUBT THERE WILL BE SOME WEAK SHORTWAVES 
EMBEDDED IN THIS NWLY FLOW.

HAVE GONE A LITTLE ON THE COOL SIDE OF TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE FOR THE 
FIRST FEW DAYS...UNTIL UPPER TROUGH BUILDS NORTHWARD...THEN NEAR 
GUIDANCE FOR THE REMAINDER.

SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...ATMOSPHERE WILL BE SLOW TO 
TRANSITION FROM PLEASANT DRY REGIME AS A LEADING FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
LIMPS THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY LATER IN THE DAY WEDNESDAY. THE FRONT 
WILL REQUIRE ASSISTANCE FROM A STRONGER SHORT WAVE CURRENTLY OVER 
ONTARIO. THE CANADIAN UPPER TROF WILL AMPLIFY AS IT SWINGS SOUTHEAST 
INTO THE GREAT LAKES. MOISTURE RETURN/CONVERGENCE WILL BE VERY 
LIMITED AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON WEDNESDAY. THEREFORE...KEPT A DRY 
FORECAST IN PLACE DURING THE SHORT TERM AWAITING BETTER LIFT AND 
DEEPER MOISTURE LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. EDGED MIN TEMPS 
CLOSER TO MILDER MET MOS WHICH HAS VERIFIED BETTER IN RECENT DAYS 
WHILE STICKING CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR WEDNESDAY.     


LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS HAVE NOT BEEN 
TOO CONSISTENT FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD AND MODEL AGREEMENT IS FAIR 
AT BEST FOR THE DETAILS...CONTRIBUTING TO FORECAST CONFIDENCE THAT 
IS BELOW AVERAGE. COLD FRONT FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...SO WILL CARRY HIGHEST POPS FOR THOSE 
PERIODS AND WILL MENTION THUNDER...ALTHOUGH CONVECTIVE ENERGY LOOKS 
TO BE UNIMPRESSIVE AT THIS POINT.  GFS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY AND INVERTED TROUGH THAT AFFECTS THE AREA FOR 
FRIDAY...BUT ENOUGH SUPPORT TO WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE 
POPS.  MODELS SHOW SOME MOISTURE HANGING AROUND FOR THE WEEKEND INTO 
MONDAY AND CERTAINLY COULD SEE AN IMPULSE OR TWO BRING SOME 
SHOWERS...BUT GIVEN POOR MODEL AGREEMENT/CONSISTENCY AND 
DIFFICULTIES TIMING ANY SUBTLE FEATURES THAT FAR OUT WILL KEEP 
CURRENT DRY FORECAST FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY.  NEXT FRONT MAY BE 
APPROACHING NEXT TUESDAY...SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...ATMOSPHERE WILL BE SLOW TO 
TRANSITION FROM PLEASANT DRY REGIME AS A LEADING FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
LIMPS THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY LATER IN THE DAY WEDNESDAY. THE FRONT 
WILL REQUIRE ASSISTANCE FROM A STRONGER SHORT WAVE CURRENTLY OVER 
ONTARIO. THE CANADIAN UPPER TROF WILL AMPLIFY AS IT SWINGS SOUTHEAST 
INTO THE GREAT LAKES. MOISTURE RETURN/CONVERGENCE WILL BE VERY 
LIMITED AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON WEDNESDAY. THEREFORE...KEPT A DRY 
FORECAST IN PLACE DURING THE SHORT TERM AWAITING BETTER LIFT AND 
DEEPER MOISTURE LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. EDGED MIN TEMPS 
CLOSER TO MILDER MET MOS WHICH HAS VERIFIED BETTER IN RECENT DAYS 
WHILE STICKING CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR WEDNESDAY.     


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS HAVE NOT 
BEEN TOO CONSISTENT FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD AND MODEL AGREEMENT IS 
FAIR AT BEST FOR THE DETAILS...CONTRIBUTING TO FORECAST CONFIDENCE 
THAT IS BELOW AVERAGE. COLD FRONT FORECAST TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...SO WILL CARRY HIGHEST POPS FOR THOSE 
PERIODS AND WILL MENTION THUNDER...ALTHOUGH CONVECTIVE ENERGY LOOKS 
TO BE UNIMPRESSIVE AT THIS POINT.  GFS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY AND INVERTED TROUGH THAT AFFECTS THE AREA FOR 
FRIDAY...BUT ENOUGH SUPPORT TO WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE 
POPS.  MODELS SHOW SOME MOISTURE HANGING AROUND FOR THE WEEKEND INTO 
MONDAY AND CERTAINLY COULD SEE AN IMPULSE OR TWO BRING SOME 
SHOWERS...BUT GIVEN POOR MODEL AGREEMENT/CONSISTENCY AND 
DIFFICULTIES TIMING ANY SUBTLE FEATURES THAT FAR OUT WILL KEEP 
CURRENT DRY FORECAST FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY.  NEXT FRONT MAY BE 
APPROACHING NEXT TUESDAY...SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS.

OFF THE HIGH TERRAIN. THIS ACTION SHOULD BE COMPLETE BY 00Z TUE SO 
NO POPS MENTION IN THE TONIGHT PERIOD. TROUGH EXITS TONIGHT ALLOWING 
FOR A QUIET PERIOD WITH A SLIGHT RISE IN HEIGHTS ALOFT. SO 
MAINTAINED DRY FORECAST TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AWAITING SLOW

VALLEY BY 00Z THU. CONVECTION MAKE TAKE A WHILE TO DEVELOP OUT AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT WITH VERY WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AVAILABLE FOR

ALONG A WEAK AXIS OF CONVERGENCE AT THE SURFACE ACROSS ERN PARTS OF
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU NE INTO SW VA AND W VA. SCATTERED COVERAGE
MAY BE NOTED ALONG AND JUST EAST OF THE AXIS INTO THE EARLY EVENING
HOURS...SO I NUDGED POPS UP JUST A BIT IN THE 00-04Z GRID WITH
AREAL QUALIFIER. KEPT SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AFTER

AN INCREASED LIKLIHOOD WHERE ANY RAIN OCCURS TODAY OR TONIGHT.

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS IS PROGGED BY GENERALLY ALL MODELS TO BE
EAST OF OUR WRN COUNTIES MONDAY...AND THERE APPEARS TO BE LESS
FORCING FOR CONVECTION. I OPTED TO FOLLOW THE FAVORED GFS/ECMWF
MODELS AND KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR HIGHER TERRAINS AREAS BUT
DRY FOR MOST OF THE VALLEY ON MONDAY.

OTHERWISE...W TO NW FLOW ALOFT ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH DRY
FORECAST GOOD. BLENDED A LITTLE CLOSER TO COOLER GFS MOS FOR MINS
WHILE THE MOS MAX TEMPS WERE CLOSE EACH DAY AND FOLLOWED.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY SLIDES EAST ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH BEHIND THE SURFACE BOUNDARY. HAD TO MAINTAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE

CONTINUE HINT AT INVERTED TROF FORMATION EXTENDING FROM THE DEEP 
SOUTH NORTH ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE. LOOKS LIKE SOME ISENTROPIC 
LIFTING MAY BE AVAILABLE AT THIS TIME. STAYED WITH THE DRY FORECAST 
FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT BEHIND THIS ACTION WITH RISING

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH 
AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
WILL SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD TODAY...TRIGGERING ISOLATED CONVECTION 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AS THE AIR MASS BECOMES 
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST 
MOST EVERYWHERE FOR TODAY...EXCEPT ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
WHERE INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE WILL BE A LITTLE HIGHER...SO WILL 
MENTION SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL 
TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...TROF AXIS PASSES TO OUR EAST 
MONDAY ALTHOUGH MODELS SUGGEST LINGERING MOISTURE MAY TOUCH OFF 
ISOLATED ACTIVITY MONDAY. NOT SURE IF IT IS ENOUGH TO WARRANT A 
MENTION EXCEPT THAT IT IS ALREADY IN THE GRIDS SO WILL LEAVE IT 
THERE FOR MONDAY. OTHERWISE DRY MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. 
THE NEXT RAIN CHANCE COMES IN ON WEDNESDAY WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE AND 
A SOMEWHAT ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AS HIGH PRESSURE IN GULF OF MEXICO AND 
LOW PRESSURE GREAT LAKES WILL KEEP MOISTURE TRAVERSING AREA THROUGH 
FRIDAY. ACCORDING TO PREVIOUS RUNS OF DGEX AND ECMWF...THERE IS 
POTENTIAL FOR A SHORTWAVE TO ENTER THE BASE OF THE EASTERN TROUGH 
AND ORGANIZE PRECIP A LITTLE BETTER FOR FRIDAY...ALTHOUGH THE LATEST 
GFS DOESN/T SUPPORT THIS SO MUCH. BUT A DRY SATURDAY SEEMS TO BE 
SHAPING UP. WARMEST TEMPS OF THE WEEK SHOULD BE TUES/WED BEFORE THE 
NEXT COOL DOWN OCCURS.

OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS UNTIL 8PM
FOR WRN MOST PLATEAU AREAS...BUT DRY ELSEWHERE WITH PATCHY AREAS OF
FOG DEVELOPING LATE TONIGHT. MOS MINS PROBABLY MORE REASONABLE FOR
TONIGHT SO FOLLOWED MORE CLOSELY THAN PAST FEW NIGHTS.

FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY...RAIN CHANCES SEEMED LESS IMPRESSIVE
THAN PREVIOUS RUNS...ALTHO UPPER LOW DOES OPEN AND SLOWLY MOVE EAST.
OPTED TO KEEP POPS MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AND LOWERED RAIN
CHANCES SLIGHTLY TO MESH BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. PATCHY FOG
COULD BE OIN UR PICTURE AGAIN SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT NOT ADDED JUST
YET.

MOS MAX TEMPS EACH DAY CLOSELY FOLLOWED AND A BLEND OF SIMILAR MOS
MINS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER 
TO THE ECMWF THIS PERIOD WHICH STARTS OUT DRY UNTIL WEDNESDAY AS A 
COLD FRONT DROPS SOUTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA. KEPT CHANCE POPS 
GOING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS FRONT SHIFTS SLOWLY SOUTH. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO SHOW ACTIVE PERIOD INTO FRIDAY AS ENERGY RIDES SOUTHEAST 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS KEEPING A 
CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM GOING WITH BEST CHANCE ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA CLOSER TO DEEP 
SOUTH FRONTAL BOUNDARY. PERHAPS SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE 
AVAILABLE IN THIS AREA. TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AT THE END OF THE 
EXTENDED FORECAST ON SATURDAY TO APPLY PROBABILITY OF PRECIP SO KEPT 
IT DRY. WENT A DEGREE OR TWO LOWER THAN MEX MOS FROM WEDNESDAY 
FORWARD AS COOL CANADIAN AIR INVADES THE EASTERN STATES.

CONTINUE TO SHOW DRY AIR ADVECTING ACROSS THE REGION...BUT SURFACE
TO AROUND 750 MB LEVEL REMAINS QUITE MOIST. THIS HAS RESULTED IN
JUST AN OCCASIONAL BREAK IN THE CLOUD COVER...LIMITING MIXING AND
KEEPING MAX TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW MOS FOR YET ANOTHER DAY.
KMRX RADAR BACK ON LINE AFTER MAINTENANCE SHOWS SPOTTY LIGHT
SHOWERS OVER SW VA...SO I WILL CONTINUE THE SLIGHT CHANCE EVENING
POPS FOR SW V/NE TN AREAS...DRY ELSEWHERE.  

THERE IS A FAIRLY HIGH POTENTIAL FOR AT LEAST PATCHY DENSE FOG
OVERNIGHT...IF SKIES PARTIALLY CLEAR. WENT AHEAD AND MENTIONED THIS
IN ALL FORECAST GROUPS. THE CLOUDS AND POSSIBLE FOG DEVELOPMENT DO
NOT FAVOR THE COOL MOS MINS...SO I TRENDED ABOUT 2 TO 4 DEGREES
ABOVE MOS FOR TONIGHT'S MINS.

OTPED TO KEEP SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT MAINLY DRY...WITH
POSSIBLE PATCHY FOG AGAIN SATURDAY NIGHT. MOS HAS BEEN A FEW
DEGREES TOO WARM FOR HIGHS...SO FOLLOWED JKL LEAD AND STAYED BELOW
THE GFS MOS FOR HIGHS BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

TEMPS WARM TO JUST ABOUT CLIMO ON SUNDAY WITH AT LEAST SLIGHT
INSTABILITY...AS MOISTURE INCREASES AHEAD OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
TO OUR WEST. NO REASON NOT TO KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS
FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...LEANED A LITTLE BIT 
CLOSER TO THE GFS WHICH SHOWS A STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BUILDING 
SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. AT THE START OF THE PERIOD. KEPT 
THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION THROUGH MONDAY WHILE 
MAINTAINING THE DRY PERIOD MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AS 
DRIER AIR AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILD IN BEHIND THIS FEATURE. TWEAKED 
POPS UP SLIGHTLY FOR WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS BROAD UPPER 
TROUGH GRADUALLY AMPLIFIES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN STATES DRIVING A 
COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO THE MID SOUTH. FRONTAL MOVEMENT WILL BE 
RATHER SLOW AS ADDITIONAL UPSTREAM ENERGY RIDES TOWARD THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. THEREFORE...ADDED SOME SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
A COUPLE MORE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT. EXPECTING A NORTHWEST FLOW TO DEVELOP ALOFT ON 
FRIDAY WITH SURFACE RIDGING ENDING ANY CHANCE OF RAIN BY FRIDAY.

.DISCUSSION...PARTIAL CLEARING OCCURRED JUST BEFORE DAYBREAK THIS 
MORNING OVER MAINLY SE TN...A GOOD SIGN THAT MORE BREAKS OF SUNSHINE 
WILL OCCUR BY THIS AFTERNOON. 12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS THIS DRIER AIR 
IN THE LOW LEVELS PLUS A WEAKENING OF THE MID LEVEL INVERSION...THAT
HAS BEEN TRAPPING THE MOISTURE FROM SURFACE TO 800 MBS. HOWEVER...
12Z RNK SOUNDING STILL SHOWS A FAIRLY STRONG INVERSION FROM 740 TO 
680 MBS...WHICH WILL HINDER MIXING FOR NE TN AND SW VA AREAS. 

FORECAST GRIDS LOOK GOOD...BUT I WILL ADJUST THE SKY COVER GRIDS TO 
ALLOW FOR MORE CLEARING OVER SE TN INTO AT LEAST THE CENTRAL VALLEY 
COUNTIES. HOURLY TEMPS RUNNING VERY CLOSE TO GRIDS AND THE MAX TEMP 
GRID LOOKS GENERALLY ON TRACK FOR TODAY...WITH ACTUAL HIGHS VERY 
DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF CLEARING.

PLAN TO FRESHEN GRIDS AND ALL PRODUCTS AROUND 11 AM. ONE COMMENT ON 
TONIGHT...PATCHY DENSE DEVELOPED RATHER QUICKLY THIS MORNING WHERE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE 
REMNANTS OF TROPICAL SYSTEM LEE CENTERED OVER CENTRAL INDIANA...WITH 
A TROUGH EXTENDING ALONG THE PIEDMONT REGION OF THE CAROLINAS. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF MID-LEVEL CLOUDS OVER 
THE TN AND OHIO RIVER VALLEYS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMNANTS OF LEE. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE MID-LEVEL INVERSION TRAPPING THIS 
MOISTURE OVER THE REGION WILL WEAKEN BY TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW 
FOR SOME MIXING OUT OF THIS MOISTURE. WITH SOME CLEARING EXPECTED... 
THINK THAT PATCHY FOG WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. WILL PLAN TO LEAVE A MENTION OF ISOLATED SHOWERS 
FOR THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA...SINCE THE NAM AND 
GFS MODELS AGREE THAT SOME LIGHT RAIN MAY DEVELOP IN THESE AREAS. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE WHERE SOME 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...REMNANTS OF T.S. LEE STILL 
IN THE PICTURE AT THE START OF THIS PERIOD...THEN FINALLY AN UPPER 
TROUGH ROTATING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES DIGS DEEPLY ENOUGH TO PHASE 
WITH LEE AND GET HIM MOVING BY SUNDAY.  THIS TROUGH THEN SLOWLY 
PASSES THROUGH THE AREA SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AND ACTUALLY GETS 
FAIRLY WELL ORGANIZED AS IT PUSHES THROUGH. FOR POPS ON SUNDAY... 
MOISTURE LOOKS TO BE QUESTIONABLE...BUT WILL GO WITH HIGHER NAM MOS 
FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON. TROUGH LOOKS LIKE IT COULD DRAG ITS HEEL 
GETTING OUT OF AREA BY MONDAY...SO LEAVING SOME LIGHT POPS IN FOR 
MONDAY.  KEEPING THINGS DRY MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT... 
THEN NEXT SYSTEM COMES ROLLING INTO THE REGION AROUND WEDNESDAY.  
PRESENTLY EXCELLENT AGREEMENT BETWEEN MODELS WITH THE TIMING OF THIS 
SYSTEM.  DEW POINTS SHOULD RETURN BACK INTO THE LOWER TO MID 60S 
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT.  DEPENDING ON TIMING...THIS SYSTEM MIGHT 
OFFER SOME SEVERE STORMS IF FRONT HITS DURING MAX HEATING. WILL KEEP 
MINIMAL POPS IN FOR THURSDAY...IN CASE FRONT MOVES SLOWER.

FOR TEMPS...WILL KEEP SUNDAY A LITTLE COOLER THAN GUIDANCE DUE TO 
EXPECTING MORE CLOUD COVER THAN MODELS SUGGEST.  WENT COOLER THAN 
GUIDANCE FOR MINS NEXT THU AND FRI AS GFS LOOKS TO BE OVERLY 
HESITANT TO BUILD IN DRIER AIR.  OBVIOUSLY, HAVE GONE BELOW GUIDANCE 
FOR DEW POINTS IN LAST FEW PERIODS...AFTER FRONT HAS PASSED.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...PESKY REMNANTS OF T.S.
LEE HAVE CONTINUED TO CIRCULATE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE REGION
THIS AFTERNOON...TO REPLACE ANY THAT HAS MIXED OUT. THE RESULT HAS
BEEN PROLONGED MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY SKIES...AND MAX TEMPS THAT
HAVE STRUGGLED TO REACH EVEN THE COOLER MOS HIGHS. 

MOS GUIDANCE TRIES TO ERODE THE LOW CLOUDINESS IN SOME SPOTS
OVERNIGHT...BUT THIS SEEMS TOO OPTIMISTIC TO ME GIVEN THE DEPTH OF
MOISTURE AND CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT. I EXPECT SKIES TO STAY MOSTLY
CLOUDY WHICH WILL HAVE 2 EFFECTS...1) WARMER MIN TEMPS THAN MOS AND
2) INHIBIT ANY SIGNIFICANT/DENSE FOG FROM DEVELOPING. THUS...KEPT
MINS ABOVE THE COOLER GFS MOS AND CLOSER TO NAM. 

DON'T SEE MUCH MORE THAN PATCHY LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE TONIGHT
...WHICH I WILL COVER WITH A 20 PERCENT POP WITH SRN AREAS DRY.

OTHERWISE...LITTLE CHANGES MADE FOR LATER PERIODS AS CLOSED UPPER
LOW DRIFTS W-SW FROM THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. I DON'T SEE MUCH IF ANY
FORCING FOR SHOWERS BY SATURDAY...WITH LITTLE IF ANY INSTABILITY IN
SPITE OF MAX TEMPS WARMING BACK UP TO CLIMO. THUS...I REMOVED ALL
POPS FOR SATURDAY. TRENDED TOWARD A MOS BLEND ON MINS FRIDAY NIGHT
AND ALSO FOR HIGHS BOTH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...STAYED A LITTLE 
CLOSER TO THE GFS AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH FILLS IN BEHIND THE 
SLOWLY DEPARTING UPPER LOW. THUS WITH ADEQUATE MOISTURE AROUND AND 
BROAD SCALE LIFT WITH THE APPROACHING TROUGH...MAINTAINED SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY DAYTIME PERIODS. SOME INSTABILITY 
WILL BE PRESENT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION. WAS ABLE TO KEEP 
TUESDAY DRY WITH FORECAST AREA IN BETWEEN SYSTEMS. BY WEDNESDAY TAIL 
END OF TRAILING GREAT LAKES UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL DRAG A COLD 
FRONT INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS PRODUCING THE BEST CHANCE FOR A 
SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR CONVECTION GOING ON THURSDAY DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WITH FRONTAL 
TIMING WITH POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE RIDING ALONG 
BOUNDARY. TRENDED MAX TEMPS A LITTLE BELOW MEX MOS NUMBERS WHILE 
ADDING A DEGREE OR TWO TO MINS.

MOISTURE CONTINUES TO CIRCULATE CCW INTO THE FORECAST AREA. BOTH THE 
SURFACE AND UPPER LOW REMNANTS OF T.S. LEE HAVE MOVED SLIGHTLY NORTH 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE SURFACE LOW NOW CENTERED ROUGHLY OVER THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS AND THE UPPER LOW OVER NRN KY/ERN IN/WRN OH.

ALTHOUGH PRECIPITATION HAS DIMINISHED THIS AFTERNOON...GIVEN THE 
SATURATED AIRMASS OVERNIGHT...I WILL CONTINUE THE LOW CHANCE POPS 
NORTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTH. PRECIPITATION TYPE SEEMS BEST 
WORDED AS LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE...WITH PATCHY FOG LATE. 

OTHERWISE...THIS UPPER LOW IS RATHER STUCK IN PLACE AND WILL LIFT 
GRADUALLY NORTH THEN WEST THROUGH FRIDAY. I WOULD EXPECT A FEW 
BREAKS OF SUNSHINE POSSIBLE THURSDAY AFTERNOON...THEN EVEN MORE ON 
FRIDAY. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR DAYTIME HIGHS TO RECOVER SOME EACH DAY 
BUT STILL REMAIN ABOUT 3 TO 5 DEGREES BELOW CLIMO BY FRIDAY. MOS 
MINS WERE CLOSE AND FOLLOWED...BUT I TRENDED A BIT CLOSER TO THE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER HIGHS THURSDAY AND NEAR THE WARMER GFS MOS HIGHS 
FRIDAY.

THERE IS NOT MUCH FORCING FOR PRECIPITATION...SO I CONTINUED THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...
WITH SOME AREAS TWEAKED TO LESS THAN 15 PERCENT POPS AS APPROPRIATE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SURFACE LOW WITH T.S. LEE
REMNANTS WAS LOCATED ACROSS THE SRN APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON.
THE MOST PERSISTENT LIGHT RAINS HAVE BEEN ROTATING SOUTHWARD ON THE
BACKSIDE OF THE LOW PRESSURE AREA...ALTHO NEW SHOWERS HAVE ALSO
DEVELOPED OVER THE CENTRAL AND NRN TN VALLEY WHERE SOME BREAKS IN
CLOUD COVER OCCURRED. LIGHT SHOWERS SEEM POSSIBLE GENERALLY
ANYWHERE OVERNIGHT...AS THE REMNANTS LIFT NE. BEST RAIN CHANCES
APPEAR TO BE OVER THE NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES...SO I KEPT POPS AT LOW
END OF LIKELY THERE AND JUST HIGH CHANCE ELSEWHERE. WINDS SHOULD
STAY UP ENOUGH PLUS CLOUD COVER TO KEEP FOG JUST PATCHY OVERNIGHT. 

ANY RAINFALL SHOULD BE LESS THAN 1/10 OF AN INCH PER HOUR...SO I
OPTED TO CANCEL THE FLOOD WATCH WITH THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

LINGERING SCATTERED SHOWERS WEDNESDAY LOOKED ON TRACK...AS DID MIN
AND MAX TEMP GRIDS. DID NOT STRAY FAR FROM SIMILAR MOS TEMPS...
BUT I DID FAVOR THE SLIGHTLY COOLER NAM MOS FOR HIGHS WEDNESDAY.
 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A CLOSED CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WILL BE LINGERING OVER THE OHIO VALLEY 
FROM THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD TO SUNDAY. THE PRESENCE OF 
THIS LOW SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES A BIT BELOW NORMAL WITH BROKEN TO 
OVERCAST CLOUD COVER. HOWEVER THE CHANCES OF PRECIP LOOK LOW...NO 
GREATER THAN A LOW CHANCE...AS A GOOD MOISTURE FEED IS LACKING TO 
OVERCOME MIDLEVEL DRY AIR...AND LIFT IS WEAK. THERE IS SOME WEAK 
INSTABILITY UNDER RELATIVELY COOLER MIDLEVEL TEMPS WHICH MAY 
GENERATE SOME ISOLATED DAYTIME SHOWERS FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. POPS 
WILL BE LOWERED THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD. THE LOW TRANSITIONS INTO 
A PROGRESSIVE OPEN WAVE ON SUNDAY...AND DRY NW FLOW DEVELOPS. THIS 
SHOULD LEAD TO MORE SUNSHINE AND SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES FOR 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

SPIN ACROSS NORTHWEST GEORGIA. THE TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT AROUND
THIS LOW HAS PRODUCED WINDY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF
THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...GRADIENTS WEAKENS THIS MORNING...SO
WILL ONLY CONTINUE THROUGH 15Z.

WATER VAPOR SHOWS A DRY SLOT MOVING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHAINS WHICH WILL DIMINISH THE CONCERN FOR ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAINS.
ALSO...DEVELOPING SOUTHEASTERLY OVER THE MOUNTAINS WILL INCREASE
THE INFLUENCE OF DOWNSLOPE DRYING INTO THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL
VALLEY. AREAL COVERAGE OF SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH THIS MORNING WITH
SKIES BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY AT TIMES BETWEEN MRX AND TRI BY THIS
AFTERNOON. EVEN THOUGH SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH...DECIDED TO KEEP
FLOOD WATCH GOING DUE TO EXPECTED ADDITIONAL RIVER FLOODING
PROBLEMS.

MODEL DO SHOW THE DEFORMATION ZONE OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE COMING
CLOSE ENOUGH TO THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE LATER TODAY TO
KEEP POPS LIKELY FOR TODAY.

DUE TO THE EXPECTED BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS...HAVE WARMER TEMPERATURES
FOR THE MRX AND TRI AREAS FOR TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE PLATEAU
AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE CLOSER TO DEFORMATION ZONE. ONLY SCATTERED
SHOWERS POSSIBLE OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHEAST SECTIONS. DUE TO
LIGHT WINDS...SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS...AND MOIST GROUND...AREAS OF

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN ACTIVE 24-36 HOURS ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY BECOMING QUASI-STATIONARY
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHAINS. ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE FROM THE
REMAINS OF TROPICAL STORM LEE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
COLLIDING WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE LIFT WILL BE ENHANCED BY
THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 80+KT JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. THE
DIRECT CIRCULATION AROUND THIS JET WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTEGENETIC
FORCING ACROSS THE EASTERN-SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

PERSISTENT AREA OF RAIN (MODERATE TO HEAVY) WILL TRAIN NORTHEAST
ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. PWS AT OR ABOVE 2 INCHES WILL BE NEAR
THE 99 PERCENTILE DUE TO THE ABUNDANT TROPICAL MOISTURE. THE
PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL PLACEMENT MAXIMIZES OVER THE EASTERN AND
SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA GIVEN GOOD PRECIPITATION
EFFICIENCY. HPC QPF QUANTITY AND PLACEMENT LOOKS GOOD AND HAVE
FOLLOWED CLOSELY WHICH PLACES 7-8 INCHES OF RAINFALL FOR THE
SOUTHERN-EASTERN AREAS AND 4-5 INCHES FOR THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE VALLEY. LOCALLY HEAVIER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE AS
CENTER OF THE REMAINS OF LEE MOVE ACROSS THE AREA LATE TODAY AND 
OVERNIGHT.

WILL MAINTAIN CURRENT FLASH FLOOD WATCH WITH EXTENSIVE FLASH
FLOODING AND STREAM FLOODING ANTICIPATED BEGINNING LATER TODAY
THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE MAIN BAND OF MOISTURE FROM 
TS LEE WILL BE PULLING AWAY FROM THE AREA ON TUESDAY BUT WILL STILL 
BE PROVIDING WIDESPREAD LIGHT TO MODERATE RAINFALL ACROSS THE 
REGION.  BEYOND THAT...THERE CONTINUES TO BE SOME DISCREPANCIES IN 
MODELS BUT OVERALL PATTERN POINTS TO THE REMNANTS OF THE LOW CUTTING 
OFF AND CONTINUING TO MEANDER AROUND THE REGION FOR MOST OF THE 
EXTENDED.  THIS WILL KEEP THE MRX CWA IN AN UNSETTLE PATTERN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO HAVE 
SOME DIFFERENCES RUN TO RUN AND BETWEEN MODELS...SO CONFIDENCE ON 
THE DETAILS OF PRECIP AMOUNTS AND AXIS OF HEAVIEST PRECIP STILL HAS 
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY.  NAM SOLUTION OF MOVING THE FRONT THROUGH 
FAIRLY QUICKLY IS AN OUTLIER...SO WILL TREND TOWARD MORE OF AN 
ECMWF/GFS SOLUTION WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE OFFICIAL "LEE" 
FORECAST.  AT ANY RATE REMNANTS OF LEE FORECAST TO SLOWLY MOVE NORTH 
AND NORTHEAST...AS COLD FRONT PUSHES IN FROM THE NORTHWEST.  THE 
INFLUX OF TROPICAL MOISTURE SHOULD BRING VERY HEAVY RAINS TO THE 
AREA...WITH FLASH FLOODING AND EVENTUALLY RIVER FLOODING POSSIBLE.  
CONFIDENCE FAIRLY HIGH FOR HEAVY RAINS LATER TONIGHT AND 
MONDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE LOWER FOR TUESDAY AS MOST MODELS INDICATE 
HEAVIER RAINS WILL EITHER BE SHIFTED EAST...OR DRIER AIR MAY BE 
WRAPPING IN.  HOWEVER...GIVEN UNCERTAINTY...FOR NOW WILL KEEP FFA IN 
EFFECT THROUGH TUESDAY AS IT CURRENTLY IS.

WITH ULTIMATE TRACK/FATE OF REMNANT LOW OF TS LEE. WITH THE

REMNANTS OUT OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY TUESDAY NIGHT...MOST 
MODELS AND ENSEMBLES DEPICT FEATURE TO REMAIN CUT OFF FROM UPPER 
FLOW AND MEANDER AROUND THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION THROUGH THE

ESSENTIALLY DISCOUNTED NAM SOLUTIONS AND CONTINUED CHANCE TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM. TEMPS ALSO IN QUESTION AS 
DEGREE OF CLOUD COVER AND INFILTRATION OF COOLER AIR FROM THE NORTH 
WILL BECOME PREDOMINANT FACTORS. TENDED TO UNDERCUT MAV/MEX GUIDANCE 
TEMPS SLIGHTLY ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE LOW WITH REGARD TO TEMPS.

IN PLACE WITH PW AROUND 1.25 INCH. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE THE HEAT
WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 90S ACROSS MOST OF THE

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WILL CONTINUE WITH LOW POPS 
MOVING IN SATURDAY AFTERNOON AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT.  
FRONT SHOULD MOVE THROUGH SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...PROVIDING US WITH OUR 
BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION FOR THE EXTENDED.  MODELS IN POOR 
AGREEMENT IN DETAILS...THOUGH IN GENERAL THEY ARE PREDICTING THE 
REMNANTS OF A TROPICAL SYSTEM WILL MOVE IN MONDAY INTO MONDAY 
NIGHT.  THE ADDED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL AID FRONTAL CONVECTION 
EARLY IN THE WEEK.  THE QUESTION REMAINS HOW LONG THE REMNANTS OF 
THE SYSTEM WILL EFFECT AREA WEATHER.  HAVE ADDED LOW POPS INTO 
TUESDAY BUT CONFIDENCE BECOMES QUITE LOW FOR WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY.  FOR NOW...HAVE OPTED TO NOT CHANGE CURRENT FORECAST AND

MAY BE MORE CLOUD COVER ACROSS SE SECTIONS OF FORECAST AREA AS LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES. NAM AND RUC INDICATE MORE CONVECTION
LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING SO AFTERNOON PACKAGE MAY HAVE TO

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE MASSIVE RIDGE PATTERN WILL 
KEEP A PERSISTENCE FORECAST GOING WHICH FEATURES VERY WARM 
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW TO MID 90S WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. LIMITED 
MOISTURE AND WARM AIR ALOFT WILL KEEP ANY CHANCE OF A SHOWER OUT OF

SURFACE TRIES TO RADIATE AWAY THE DAY'S EXCESSIVE HEAT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A MIDLEVEL RIDGE WILL BE 
PARKED OVER THE AREA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH TEMPERATURES 
CONTINUING ABOVE NORMAL AND ISOLATED SHOWERS AT BEST. A TROUGH 
BEGINS TO DIG INTO THE UPPER MS REGION ON SATURDAY...BECOMING 
INCREASINGLY AMPLIFIED AS IT CROSSES THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY. LIFT AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING MORE ORGANIZED PRECIP 
TO THE AREA ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY NIGHT. THE TIMING OF THE 
FROPA IN THE GFS AND ECMWF IS MONDAY...SO CHANCE POPS WILL SPILL

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE 
OVER THE REGION. WITH JUST SOME MINOR MOISTENING OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE...LOOKS LIKE INSTABILITY/MOISTURE WILL STILL BE LIMITED 
ENOUGH TO KEEP THINGS DRY THROUGH THURSDAY.  WILL GENERALLY GO 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE MAV TEMPS FOR TONIGHT...BUT NOT MUCH ARGUMENT WITH 
HIGHS FOR THURSDAY.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SHORT RANGE
ENSEMBLE MODELS KEEP ELONGATED RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE
SOUTHEAST AND TENNESSEE VALLEY WESTWARD TO THE SOUTHWESTERN STATES
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE
CENTERED ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD AND LOW PRESSURE OVER THE NW
GULF HAS SOME POTENTIAL TO BECOME A TROPICAL SYSTEM BY THE WEEKEND.
AS SW FLOW BRINGS IN A MORE MOIST AIRMASS FRIDAY A FEW SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS COULD FORM IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN OF EASTERN TN AND
SW NC AND POSSIBLY INTO SW VA. THIS CONVECTION SHOULD DIE DOWN BY
EARLY EVENING. LOWS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN THE 60S TO NEAR 70 WITH
HIGHS SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FROM NEAR 90 TO THE MID 90S AT
LOWER ELEVATIONS. SATURDAY GULF SYSTEM MAY BECOME MORE ORGANIZED
AND TAKE ON TROPICAL CHARACTERISTICS WHILE A LITTLE MORE MOISTURE
SHOULD BRING MORE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM COVERAGE BUT STILL
ISOLATED. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL ALSO BE DROPPING INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY BUT SHOWERS WILL STAY NORTH. FROM SUNDAY ON THE FORECAST
BECOMES MORE UNCLEAR WITH GFS MODEL BRINGING COLD FRONT AND UPPER
TROUGH INTO THE FORECAST AREA WITH TROPICAL SYSTEM DEEPENING AND
SPINNING ALONG THE COAST NEAR NEW ORLEANS...THEN COMBINING WITH THE
FRONT AND TROUGH TO CREATE AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF SHOWERS FROM
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY WITH FRONT AND TROPICAL SYSTEM SLOWLY
LIFTING NE THROUGH THE SE AND TN VALLEY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE
ECMWF PUSHES THE TROPICAL SYSTEM WEST INTO TX WHILE THE COLD FRONT
MOVES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WITH HIGHER PRESSURE BUILDING
IN TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. FOR NOW DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WILL KEEP
RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THE END OF THE EXTENDED. HIGHS WILL BE MUCH
COOLER AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE SUNDAY NIGHT EARLY MONDAY BUT NIGHTS
WILL STAY WARMER IF CLOUDS LINGER WITH TROPICAL SYSTEM.

300 AM EDT WED AUG 31 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE MAIN STORY WILL BE AN 
EXPANDING RIDGE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. A SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH WILL RIDE HARMLESSLY EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY TODAY WITH VERY LITTLE IMPACT OTHER THAN SOME CI AND A BIT OF 
AC. THE RIDGE IN COMBINATION WITH LATE SUMMER INSOLATION WILL KEEP 
THE MINI HEAT WAVE INTACT WITH HIGHS NEARLY TEN DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL 
AGAIN TODAY. ANOTHER QUIET NIGHT IS IN STORE AS THE MASSIVE RIDGE 
CONTINUES TO SHIFT SLOWLY EAST. STAYED CLOSER TO THE WARMEST MAX 
TEMP GUIDANCE TODAY WHILE ADDING A DEGREE TO THE MILDEST SUGGESTED 
MIN TEMPS TONIGHT AS DEWPOINTS EDGE SLIGHTLY HIGHER.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A STRONG AND DEEP RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE OVER THE TN VALLEY REGION FOR THURSDAY THROUGH 
SATURDAY. THIS WILL PROVIDE CONTINUED HOT AND DRY CONDITIONS ACROSS 
THE AREA...WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S EACH DAY. WITH 
VERY DRY SOIL...WILL HAVE TEMPS ON THE WARM SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS LOOK QUITE STABLE WITH A WARM MIDLEVEL LAYER THAT 
WILL SUPPRESS CONVECTION THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. SLIGHTLY MORE 
INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE ON SATURDAY MAY LEAD TO A FEW ISOLATED 
SHOWERS. MORE ORGANIZED LIFT COMES ON SUNDAY AS THE RIDGE BREAKS 
DOWN AND A TROUGH/FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH 
FROPA EXPECTED ON MONDAY AND COOLER TEMPS ARRIVING ON TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING WILL 
STRENGTHEN AND SHIFT SLIGHTLY EASTWARD THROUGH TODAY. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN A LOW LEVEL E-SE FLOW ACROSS THE SE CONUS...WHICH WILL 
ADVECT ATLANTIC MOISTURE INTO THE TN VALLEY REGION. THUS WE SHOULD 
BEGIN TO SEE RISING DEWPOINTS AND A GREATER CU DEVELOPMENT TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON...BUT WITH A BUILDING MIDLEVEL RIDGE PROVIDING SUBSIDENCE 
ALOFT AND A GOOD CAPPING INVERSION...NO SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED. A 
WEAKNESS IN THE MID/UPPER RIDGE MOVES THROUGH ON THURSDAY AND THE 
CAP IS A BIT WEAKER...BUT MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE LIMITED SO WILL 
JUST CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP. HIGH TEMPS WILL BE IN THE MID 80S TO 
LOWER 90S EACH DAY...WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 60S WITH SOME LOWER 
70S THURSDAY NIGHT IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE PERIOD BEGINS WITH A LARGE RIDGE WHICH COVERS MOST OF
SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE A LITTLE
MORE UNSTABLE HAVING BEEN SUPPLIED WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE DUE TO
INCREASING SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW BEHIND A SOUTHEASTERN ATLANTIC LOW
LEVEL RIDGE AND EVOLVING WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM. THEREFORE...EXPECT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR
THUNDERSTORM MAINLY ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES BOTH FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY. BY SUNDAY AN UPPER TROUGH WILL BE PROGRESSING EAST ACROSS
THE UPPER MIDWEST. THE SYSTEM WILL BE DRAGGING A COLD FRONT TOWARD
THE FORECAST AREA LATER IN THE DAY SUNDAY WITH FROPA SUNDAY NIGHT.
TWEAKED POPS BACK TO LOW CHANCE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND APPLIED THE
MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION SUNDAY NIGHT AS FRONT MAKES ITS
WAY SLOWLY SOUTH AND EAST ACROSS THE REGION. DUE TO MODEL DEPICTION
OF SLOW SYSTEM MOVEMENT AND UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING MAINTAINED THE
SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE DAYTIME PERIOD ON MONDAY. STAYED
CLOSE TO NEW MEX MOS MAX GUIDANCE TEMPS SUGGESTED FOR FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY BUT UNDERCUT BY A FEW DEGREES SUNDAY AND MONDAY. ADJUSTED
MINS A LITTLE HIGHER THROUGH MUCH OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD DUE TO
HIGHER DEWPOINT AIRMASS AND GREATER CLOUD COVER EXPECTED WITH
SYNOPTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPPING SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)... 
AN INCREASINGLY AMPLIFIED MIDLEVEL TROUGH WILL BE CROSSING THE
AREA TODAY. UPSTREAM SOUNDINGS AND SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOW NEAR
SATURATION IN THE 700-500 MB LAYER...WITH A DRY LAYER BELOW. THE
MODELS DEPICT VERY LITTLE LIFT AT ALL WITH THE TROUGH...AND THE LOW
LEVEL FLOW REMAINS DIVERGENT THROUGH THE DAY. SO THE MAIN IMPACT OF
THIS TROUGH WILL BE INCREASING MIDLEVEL CLOUDS...MAINLY ACROSS
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA AND MAINLY THIS MORNING. THIS SHOULD
KEEP HIGH TEMPS BACK A COUPLE DEGREES FROM YESTERDAY. THE TROUGH
AXIS IS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS IN THE EVENING...SO WE SHOULD HAVE
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S
IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE
REGION BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY. MODELS INDICATING WEAK
SHORTWAVES RIDING OVER THE RIDGE FOR THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY
TIME PERIOD. MOISTURE IS LIMITED SO WILL CONTINUE WITH ONLY LOW
CHANCES. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY ENTERS THE REGION ON SUNDAY. WITH AN
INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND LIFT...WILL CONTINUE THE HIGHER CHANCES
FOR SUNDAY. GENERALLY NEAR TO ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE
ANTICIPATED. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

259 PM EDT SUN AUG 28 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...ENOUGH BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE
TO PRODUCE SCATTERED-BROKEN CU ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA
THIS AFTERNOON. BY SUNSET...THE CU WILL DISSIPATE GIVING WAY TO
MOSTLY CLEAR SKY. CLEAR SKY...LIGHT-CALM WINDS DUE TO BUILDING RIDGE...
AND RELATIVELY WARM AREA LAKES-STREAMS WILL ALLOW STEAM FOG TO DEVELOP.
WILL INCLUDE PATCH FOG IN THE FORECAST AREA-WIDE FOR TONIGHT. SOME
OF THE FOG COULD BECOME LOCALLY DENSE.

FOR MONDAY...A WEAKENING SHORT-WAVE WILL DIVE INTO THE EASTERN
TROUGH. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW AIRMASS QUITE DRY WITH PWS AROUND
0.75 INCH OR LESS. MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY LACKING...SO WILL ONLY
CALL FOR SCATTERED SPRINKLES ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE
FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THE EXPECTED LOW AFTERNOON
RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES WITH SOME LOCATIONS (SUCH AS SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA) DROPPING INTO THE MIDDLE
AND UPPER 20S. HOWEVER...WINDS WILL BE LIGHT...SO NO FIRE WEATHER
STATEMENT NEEDED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.  WILL THEN MOVE INTO A MILDLY UNSETTLED 
PATTERN AS A SERIES OF WEAK IMPULSES TRACK THROUGH THE REGION.  
MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS WILL BE LIMITED BUT EACH IMPULSE COULD 
GENERATE ISOLATED CONVECTION.  ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY THIS WILL 
MEAN BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION WILL MAINLY BE OVER NORTHERN AREAS AND 
HIGHER TERRAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS.  CONFIDENCE IN DETAILS 
LESSEN BY THE END OF THE WEEK AND WILL HAVE LOW POPS ON FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND AGAIN ON SATURDAY.  A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA SUNDAY BRINGING A CHANCE FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION. 
TEMPS WILL REMAIN SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TO FINISH OUT THE PERIOD.

BROKEN CU WILL DEVELOP IN THE LATE MORNING...BUT DO NOT EXPECT
ENOUGH DEVELOPMENT FOR MUCH THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY NEAR THE TAF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)... BASED ON A DEWPOINT GRADIENT...A
COLD FRONT APPEARS TO BE LOCATED ACROSS MIDDLE TN TO EASTERN
KY...THOUGH THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH IS LOCATED TO OUR SOUTH. THE
MODELS SHOW THE FRONT MAKING VERY SLOW SOUTHWARD PROGRESS TODAY. A
FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE BEEN LINGERING AROUND THROUGH THE
NIGHT...AND WITH THE FRONT IN THE VICINITY ALONG WITH UPPER 60S
DEWPOINTS...AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM CANNOT BE RULED OUT
DURING THE DAY. DEWPOINTS SHOULD LOWER INTO THE LOW TO MID 60S
TONIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT. WE WILL ALSO SEE SOME ADDITIONAL
SUBSIDENCE AND SOME CIRRUS CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE OUTER FRINGES
OF IRENE. WENT WITH TEMPERATURES ABOVE GUIDANCE AS IT WAS A BIT TOO
COOL YESTERDAY...AND VERY DRY SOIL CONDITIONS WILL HELP BOOST
TEMPERATURES UP. WE SHOULD STAY A FEW DEGREES BELOW RECORD HIGHS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BRINGING DRY
WEATHER FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY WITH HURRICANE IRENE EXPECTED
TO TRACK EAST OF OUR AREA. WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKING THROUGH THE
REGION ON TUESDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
TUESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT IS MOVING ACROSS
THE NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY. THIS FRONT IS ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT-WAVE
TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEAST UNITED
STATES. UPPER DYNAMICS FROM THIS TROUGH WILL STAY WELL NORTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA...HOWEVER...FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THIS EVENING.
MODELS SHOW MARGINAL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. WILL MAINTAIN CHANCE
POPS NORTH AND SLIGHT POPS SOUTH. BESIDES THE CONVECTION...ANOTHER
HOT DAY IS IN STORE FOR THE AREA.

CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AROUND MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...OTHERWISE
CLEARING. GENERALLY COMPROMISED BETWEEN GFS AND MET MOS NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...EXPECTED TRACK OF
HURRICANE IRENE HAS CHANGED LITTLE OVER PAST 24 HOURS...STILL NO
WEATHER OR WINDY CONDITIONS TO AFFECT OUR REGION IF IRENE STAYS ON
TRACK. SUBSIDENCE ON WRN SIDE OF IRENE WILL INHIBIT ANY
PRECIPITATON...SO KEPT A DRY FORECAST UNTIL THOSE 20 PERCENT POPS
EARLY NEXT WEEK ON TUESDAY. I DID TWEAK MAX AND MIN TEMPS DOWN JUST
A BIT FOR THE WEEKEND SINCE NORTHERLY FLOW IS EXPECTED AS IRENE
MOVES NORTH THROUGH THE NEW ENGLAND STATES. THESE NEW SLIGHTLY
LOWER HIGHS AND LOWS ALSO MESHED BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS
GRIDS...AS WELL AS 25/00Z GFSX MOS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...INITIAL AND MAIN CHALLENGE
IN THE INITIAL PART OF THE SHORT TERM FORECAST PERIODS WILL BE
TIMING THE SOUTHEAST MOVEMENT OF A WEAK COLD FRONT IN NORTHWEST
FLOW AND PRECIP CHANCES FOR THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. 

GFS/NAM ARE WITHIN REASON OF KEEPING MOST OF THE LOW-MID LEVEL
MOISTURE WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAINLY TOWARD THE TRI
CITIES/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AREA AS THE BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH THE
AREA BY 00Z FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE PRECIP CHANCES FOR
THE AREA...WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER PROBABILITIES IN THE TRI CITIES/
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AREA. THE FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN IN A
NORTHWEST FLOW ON FRIDAY...AS HIGH PRESSURE SINKS SOUTHWARD INTO
THE REGION. TEMPS SHOULD ONLY BE SLIGHTLY COOLER BEHIND THE
BOUNDARY...AND CONTINUED WITH CLOSE TRENDING OF GFS/NAM NUMBERS. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODEL CONSENSUS TAKES 
IRENE VERY NEAR THE OUTER BANKS AROUND MID DAY SATURDAY. MODELS 
GENERATE A LITTLE QPF OVER THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER TERRAIN BUT 
STILL BELIEVE THIS IS OVERDONE. THE HURRICANE SHOULD HAVE A DECENT 
AREA OF SUBSIDENCE WORKING AGAINST PRECIP DEVELOPMENT EARLY IN THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. A SHORT WAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
BUILD SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SUNDAY BUT THE RATHER HEALTHY NORTHERLY FLOW...COMPLIMENTS OF 
IRENE...SHOULD STARVE THIS SYSTEM OF NEEDED MOISTURE. THE NEXT SHOT 
AT PRECIP WILL BE ON TUESDAY AS ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROUGH DRIVES 
SOUTHEAST FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION WITH A SURFACE WAVE RIDING 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. PLACED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION 
WITH THIS SYSTEM. MODELS VARY ON TIMING/STRENGTH OF THIS FEATURE SO 
SOME ADJUSTMENT MAY OCCUR IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS. KEPT WEDNESDAY DRY 
BEHIND THIS SYSTEM. DID NOT STRAY FAR FROM NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE 
TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS

STILL EXPECTING DRY CONDITIONS TO PREVAIL HOWEVER. WEAK SURFACE 
BOUNDARY APPROACHES LATE TONIGHT. MOISTURE AND LIFT NOT TERRIBLY 
IMPRESSIVE PER MODEL TIME HEIGHTS...BUT WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION 
IS POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN TIER. FOR TEMPS...MAV AND MET 
GUIDANCE CLOSE AND APPEAR REASONABLE. GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE
MUCH FROM MAV VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS SEEM IN FAIR 
AGREEMENT ON SOME MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION FALLING AHEAD OF THE 
UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY. HOWEVER...NOT SURE HOW MUCH 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN OCCURS WITH HIGHEST CHANCE POPS MORE 
JUSTIFIED FOR SW VA AND NE TN AREAS. NUDGED POPS UP JUST A BIT FOR 
THOSE AREAS TO FIT BETTER WITH LOW LIKELY POPS FROM RNK AND RLX. 

THERE IS A CONSISTENT TREND WITH GENERALLY ALL MODELS (PERHAPS LESS 
SO WITH ECMWF) TO TAKE IRENE SLIGHTLY FURTHER EAST EACH MODEL RUN. 
THE OFFICIAL NHC TRACK HAS ALSO SHIFTED IRENE SLIGHTLY MORE EAST 
FROM EARLIER TRACKS. THIS ALL LEADS ME TO PREFER KEEPING FRIDAY 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND DRY FOR OUR AREA...NEXT TO GSP AND RNK SLIGHT 
CHANCE OR CHANCE POPS FOR THOSE PERIODS. FLOW SHOULD BE PARALLEL TO 
OUR TERRAIN SO I DON'T FORSEE DOWNSLOPE EFFECTS TO WARM MAX TEMPS 
ABOVE MOS. HOWEVER...DRY AIR IN PLACE PLUS SOME LIKELY SUBSIDENCE ON 
BACK SIDE OF THE TROPICAL SYSTEM SUPPORTS AT LEAST LATEST GFSX MAX

SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE DOES SHIFT EAST TONIGHT...AND A WEAK
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW MAY DEVELOP ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. 
HOWEVER...EXPECT VERY LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS TONIGHT WITH DRY AIR

WITH TRACK OF IRENE RESULTS IN LOW CONFIDENCE FORECAST FOR THE

EASTWARD WHICH IMPLIES LESS EFFECT FROM THIS FEATURE FOR OUR

MIN TEMPS IN THE 50S TO LOWER 60S.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK COLD FRONT IS SLIPPING INTO 
SW VA AND NRN PLATEAU AT 07-08Z WITH SCATTERED ASSOCIATED CONVECTION 
MOVING SE INTO WRN NC. CLOUDS AND THE CONVECTION WILL BE LONG GONE 
BEFORE DAYBREAK. THUS...REMOVED THE MORNING POPS FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS 
FOR TODAY. DRIER AIR FILTERS IN AS WINDS SHIFT TO THE NORTH...BUT 
MAX TEMPS SHOULD STILL BE MOSTLY 80S TO LOWER 90S IN LINE WITH 
22/00Z MOS.

CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT AND I CHOSE TO IGNORE THE FOG SUGGESTED BY BOTH 
NAM AND GFS MOS FOR NOW. N-NE WINDS WILL PROVIDE SOME LIGHT MIXING
PLUS THERE WAS LITTLE WIDESPREAD RAIN AHEAD OF THE FRONT. PLEASANT 
MIN TEMPS IN THE 50S TO LOWER 60S.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER
OHIO VALLEY WILL KEEP FORECAST AREA MOSTLY SUNNY WITH DRIER AIR
MASS TUESDAY. HIGHS WILL STILL BE NEAR NORMAL TO ABOVE NORMAL TUESDAY
AND CONTINUE THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH LOWS IN THE MID 50S TO THE
LOWER 60S TUESDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE INCREASES LATE WEDNESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF SHORTWAVE FIRST ALONG THE EAST SLOPES OF
THE APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY. THURSDAY COLD FRONT MOVES INTO SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY.
THEN FRONT BECOMES STATIONARY ACROSS FORECAST AREA FOR CONTINUED
RAIN CHANCES FRIDAY. AT THE SAME TIME MODELS BRING TROPICAL
SYSTEM...IRENE NORTH TO THE CAROLINAS SATURDAY AND INTO MID
ATLANTIC BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND. INCREASED POPS A LITTLE FOR THE
WEEKEND. TRACK OF IRENE FARTHER EAST THOUGH WILL BRING LESS CLOUDS
AND MOST SHOWER ACTIVITY EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS.

.AVIATION...SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE 
EAST AT 25 MPH THIS MORNING...AND SHOULD AFFECT AT LEAST TYS AND 
TRI. HOWEVER...THINK THIS INITIAL CONVECTION WILL ONLY PRODUCE A 
BRIEF MVFR PERIOD. STRONGER CONVECTION LATER TODAY INTO THIS EVENING 
COULD LOWER VISBYS/CEILINGS TO MVFR OR LOWER.

PREVIOUS AFD FOLLOWS...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONVECTION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP 
AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT THIS MORNING...MORE IN LINE WITH 
THE GFS MODEL SOLUTION. THIS IS AN ODDITY...SINCE GFS MOS POPS ARE 
LOWER THAN NAM MOS POPS. AIR MASS IS ALREADY SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AND 
SHOULD FURTHER DESTABILIZE AS TEMPS WARM INTO THE 80S TO LOWER 90S 
LATER TODAY. THUS...I KEPT POPS FOR TODAY IN THE 60-70 PERCENT RANGE.
MAX TEMPS SATURDAY WARMED TO OR JUST ABOVE THE HOTTER MOS 
MAXES...BUT EARLY CONVECTION AND MORE CLOUD COVER SHOULD FAVOR A MOS 
BLEND FOR HIGHS TODAY.

FRONT APPEARS TO HAVE SUFFICIENT PUSH TO MOVE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE 
REGION BEFORE 12Z MONDAY. PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT 
WITH JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...STILL SLIGHT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS EARLY MONDAY AND IN MOUNTAINS DURING THE AFTERNOON AFTER
PASAGE OF COLD FRONT. HIGHS SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN TODAY. DRIER
AIRMASS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE AND NW
FLOW SET UP BEHIND FRONT. LOWS SEVERAL DEGREES COOLER MONDAY NIGHT.
TUESDAY MOSTLY SUNNY AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OVER SOUTHERN
APPALCHIANS. SUFACE HIGH SHIFTS EAST TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.
ANOTHER COOLER NIGHT TUESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY INCREASING CLOUDS
WITH CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATE WEDNESDAY AS MOISTURE
INCREASES WITH SHORTWAVE MOVING INTO TN VALLEY. NEW COLD FRONT
EXPECTED TO APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THURSDAY. THE FRONT
MAY THEN BECOME STATIONARY NEAR THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SATURDAY.
AT THE SAME TIME HURRICANE IRENE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE OVER CUBA BY
THURSDAY AND THEN MOVE INTO FLORIDA FRIDAY AND COULD APPROACH THE

POSSIBLE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWERS AND 
STORMS HAVE DISSIPATED OR MOVED EAST OF THE REGION...AND PATCHY 
AREAS OF FOG SHOULD DEVELOP WHERE RAINS OCCURRED. NOT A CLEAR FOCUS 
FOR TSRA DEVELOPMENT LATER TODAY...OTHER THAN TERRAIN. THUS...KEPT 
MOSTLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EXCEPT FOR LOW CHANCE NEAR RNK AND GSP 
THIS AFTERNOON. MOS HIGHS WERE QUITE CLOSE AND FOLLOWED.

SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TONIGHT LOOK SUFFICIENT AS CONVECTION SHOULD 
DISSIPATE AFTER MIDNIGHT...LIKE PAST FEW NIGHTS. MODELS GENERALLY 
SUPPORT THIS THINKING UNTIL COLD FRONT EASES CLOSER ON SUNDAY. A 
BLEND OF MOS MINS CHOSEN...ALTHO NUMBERS WERE FAIRLY CLOSE.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION WILL 
LIKELY MOVE INTO THE REGION SUNDAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. HIGH 
TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY COOLER SUNDAY. KEPT POPS AT ABOUT 50 PERCENT 
WITH BETTER CHANCES NE SECTIONS AND LOWER SOUTHERN SECTIONS. FRONT 
MOSTLY THROUGH THE AREA BY MONDAY MORNING. WILL FOLLOW COOLER MET 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS MONDAY ABOUT THE SAME AS SUNDAYS HIGHS. COOLER 
AND DRIER AIR MASS MOVES IN MONDAY BEHIND COLD FRONT. STILL WITH 
MORE SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES ONLY A FEW DEGREES COOLER AND STILL ABOVE 
NORMAL. HIGHER PRESSURE CONTINUES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY 
UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS AGAIN OVER EASTERN STATES WITH UPPER LEVEL 
SYSTEM TRIGGERING MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. REPEATED 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL BRING CONTINUED CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH FRIDAY. SATURDAY THERE STILL LOOKS TO BE 
ENOUGH MOISTURE IN THE FORECAST AREA FOR A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWERS AND STORMS HAVE 
DISSIPATED OR MOVED EAST OF THE REGION...AND PATCHY AREAS OF FOG 
SHOULD DEVELOP WHERE RAINS OCCURRED. NOT A CLEAR FOCUS FOR TSRA
DEVELOPMENT LATER TODAY...OTHER THAN TERRAIN. THUS...KEPT MOSTLY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EXCEPT FOR LOW CHANCE NEAR RNK AND GSP THIS 
AFTERNOON. MOS HIGHS WERE QUITE CLOSE AND FOLLOWED.

SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TONIGHT LOOK SUFFICIENT AS CONVECTION SHOULD 
DISSIPATE AFTER MIDNIGHT...LIKE PAST FEW NIGHTS. MODELS GENERALLY 
SUPPORT THIS THINKING UNTIL COLD FRONT EASES CLOSER ON SUNDAY. A 
BLEND OF MOS MINS CHOSEN...ALTHO NUMBERS WERE FAIRLY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION WILL
LIKELY MOVE INTO THE REGION SUNDAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. HIGH
TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY COOLER SUNDAY. KEPT POPS AT ABOUT 50 PERCENT
WITH BETTER CHANCES NE SECTIONS AND LOWER SOUTHERN SECTIONS. FRONT
MOSTLY THROUGH THE AREA BY MONDAY MORNING. WILL FOLLOW COOLER MET
GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS MONDAY ABOUT THE SAME AS SUNDAYS HIGHS. COOLER
AND DRIER AIR MASS MOVES IN MONDAY BEHIND COLD FRONT. STILL WITH
MORE SUNSHINE TEMPERATURES ONLY A FEW DEGREES COOLER AND STILL ABOVE
NORMAL. HIGHER PRESSURE CONTINUES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY
UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS AGAIN OVER EASTERN STATES WITH UPPER LEVEL
SYSTEM TRIGGERING MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
REPEATED SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL BRING CONTINUED CHANCES OF SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH FRIDAY. SATURDAY THERE STILL LOOKS TO BE
ENOUGH MOISTURE IN THE FORECAST AREA FOR A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS.

OUT OVER THE VALLEY. VALLEY AND EASTERN SECTIONS HAVE A STRONGER

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOISTURE CONTINUES TO INCREASE 
ACROSS THE REGION WITH DEW POINTS NOW IN THE 60S.  THIS COMBINED 
WITH A WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND A MINOR DISTURBANCE MOVE 
THROUGH...EXPECT TO SEE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOP AND 
MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS REGION THIS AFTERNOON INTO 
TONIGHT.  COVERAGE SHOULD BE MINIMAL AND WILL KEEP POPS AT 20 TO 30 
FOR THE PERIOD.  OTHERWISE...CONTINUED WARM WITH HIGHS ONCE AGAIN 
EXPECTED TO PUSH INTO THE UPPER 80S AND LOWER 90S ACROSS VALLEY 
LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODEL RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY AND AGREEMENT HAS WORSENED SINCE 24 HOURS AGO...SO 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS NOW BELOW AVERAGE FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD. 
OVERALL PATTERN KEEPS US IN FAIRLY FLAT BUT STILL NORTHWEST 
FLOW...AND LIKELY TO BE SOME IMPULSES MOVING THROUGH ALTHOUGH 
DETAILS ON TIMING/STRENGTH SOMEWHAT HAZY.  WILL GENERALLY HAVE 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EARLY PERIODS EXCEPT NORTH FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN IT 
LOOKS LIKE MORE SIGNIFICANT WAVE MAY BE MOVING THROUGH. 
MODELS...ESPECIALLY GFS...HAVE BACKED OFF IDEA OF MORE SIGNIFICANT 
TROUGHING IN THE EAST WITH FAIRLY STRONG FRONTAL PASSAGE AROUND 
MONDAY.  HOWEVER...STILL SOME MODEL SUPPORT FOR A WEAKER FRONTAL 
PASSAGE AND...GIVEN UNCERTAINTY...FOR NOW WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS 
SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY FOLLOWED BY DRYING FOR TUE AND WED.  WILL MAKE 
ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO GFS MOS TEMPS.

SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS/NEAR TYS DUE TO A CONVERGENCE ZONE 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY. KMRX RADAR SHOWS THIS BOUNDARY QUITE 
WELL. AS SUNSET APPROACHES AND LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...SHOWERS
WILL DISSIPATE...SO WILL CONTINUE SHOWERS UNTIL 02Z. VFR CONDITIONS 
WILL PREVAIL THROUGH MOST OF THE FORECAST...EXCEPT NEAR SHOWERS AND 
AT TRI AND TYS TOWARD MORNING DUE TO FOG DEVELOPMENT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER SWRN US
AND TROUGH OVER EASTER US...SETS US UP FOR AN ACTIVE UPPER LEVEL
FLOW. AT THE LOWER LEVELS...INCREASING SOUTH WINDS SHOULD GET
MOISTURE RETURNING OVERNIGHT AND ON THURSDAY. DEW POINT READINGS
ACROSS THE AREA NOW ARE GENERALLY 55-60...BUT BY THIS TIME THURSDAY
WILL LIKELY BE IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S UP AND DOWN THE VALLEY.
EXPECTING THUNDERSTORMS TO BEGIN DEVELOPING AROUND NOON IN THE
HIGHER TERRAIN...EAST AND WEST. THE WESTERN STORMS SHOULD MOVE OFF
THE PLATEAU DURING THE AFTERNOON...CONSIDERING THE NWLY MID-LEVEL
FLOW OF 15-20 KT. 

WENT ABOUT A DEGREE OR SO BELOW GFS MOS ON THE MAX TEMPS
THURSDAY...THINKING THE ENERGY RELEASE IN THE FORM OF CUMULUS
BUILD-UPS SO EARLY IN THE DAY WILL DISSIPATE HEAT IN THE LOWER
LEVELS...PLUS SHADING OF CLOUDS WILL KEEP THE GROUND SLIGHTLY
COOLER.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED 
WEATHER IN THE OFFING THROUGH THE EARLY PORTION OF THE LONG TERM PER 
MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS AS A SERIES OF WEAK SHORT WAVES 
TRANSLATES THROUGH THE PERSISTENT NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. MOST 
SIGNIFICANT EVENT CURRENTLY POISED TO AFFECT THE REGION IN THE LATE 
SUNDAY THROUGH EARLY MONDAY TIME FRAME. CONTINUED CHANCE POPS FOR 
THE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT PERIODS BEFORE SLOWLY TAPERING POPS ON 
MONDAY. BALANCE OF WORK WEEK APPEARS GENERALLY DRY AT THIS TIME AS 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BEHIND EARLY-WEEK FRONT. TEMPS 
SHOULD FALL BACK TO NEAR CLIMO BEHIND FRONTAL PASSAGE. FOR TEMPS... 
GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE. OVERALL...MADE 
ONLY MINOR TWEAKS TO PREVIOUS GRIDS/FORECAST PACKAGE.

.AVIATION...
MOISTURE NOW RETURNING TO THE REGION WITH GOOD CUMULUS BUILD-UPS
OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN. THURSDAY OFFERS DEEPER BUILD-UPS THAT SHOULD
RESULT IN SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER MUCH OF THE HIGH
TERRAIN. STORMS THAT DEVELOP OVER THE PLATEAU WILL LIKELY MOVE TO
THE SOUTHEAST GETTING CLOSE TO KTYS AND KTRI IN THE
AFTERNOON...POSSIBLY AFTER END OF TAF AT 18Z. PUT THE CB COMMENT IN
BOTH OF THOSE SITES TO REFLECT STORMS IN THE REGION...WILL LEAVE
OUT AT KCHA FOR NOW AS STORMS WILL BE HARDER TO GENERATE THAT FAR

INFLUENCE OVER AREA WEATHER TODAY...PROVIDING DRY AND WARM

DOMINATE AS IT SHIFTS EAST OVERNIGHT...ALLOWING THE APPROACH OF THE

DRY AND MILD.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
FOR OVERALL PATTERN...ALTHOUGH STILL DIFFERENCES IN THE 
DETAILS...LEADING TO AVERAGE FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE LONG TERM.  
LOOKS LIKE A SHORT WAVE WILL AFFECT THE AREA AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE 
NORTHWEST FLOW EARLY IN THE PERIOD...SO WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE TO 
CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.  SOME WEAK RIDGING WILL 
BUILD IN FOR SATURDAY...THEN UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO RE-ESTABLISH 
ITSELF OVER THE REGION SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WITH A COLD FRONT PUSHING

SATURDAY...THEN CHANCE POPS SUNDAY AND MONDAY.  WILL DRY THINGS OUT

TONIGHT. THUS...WILL ONLY FORECAST A BRIEF MVFR PERIOD FOR TRI AND

TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 70S HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND NE TO 80S 
ELSEWHERE DURING THE LAST HOUR. DEW POINTS ARE STILL RATHER LOW IN

SKIES BECOMING MOSTLY CLEAR. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN GREAT 
LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY WILL KEEP AREA DRY ANOTHER 24 HOURS. IT WILL 
SHIFT SLOWLY EAST THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

CLOUDS OVER THE MID MS VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON ASSOCIATED WITH A

SOME OF THESE CLOUDS WILL MOVE INTO THE TN VALLEY BUT SHOULD BE 
MOSTLY HIGH LEVEL AND DISSIPATE AS THEY MOVE EAST INTO THE DRIER AIR 
MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. LOWS STILL COOL TONIGHT IN MID 50S TO

TOMORROW WITH  SHOWERS DEVELOPING BEFORE 00Z THURSDAY. PREFER SLOWER 
GFS WHICH  KEEPS DEEPER MOISTURE FROM NEXT SYSTEM TO THE WEST OF THE 
AREA UNTIL AT LEAST WEDNESDAY EVENING AHEAD OF COLD FRONT MOVING

ABOUT RIGHT.     

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...

.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS 
THE AREA BRINGING DRY WEATHER TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF 
THE FORECAST APPEARS ON TRACK. NO CHANGES NEEDED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...UPPER LOW STILL SPINNING
OVER PA AND THE MID ATLANTIC THIS AFTERNOON WITH CONSIDERABLE LOW
CLOUD COVER ROTATING BACK THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS BEEN JUST TO THE NE IN WV AND
WESTERN VA. CHALLENGE FOR TONIGHT WILL BE CLOUD COVER AND LOW
TEMPERATURES. LATEST VISIBLE SATELLITE DOES SHOW SOME DECREASE IN
CLOUDS OVER NORTHERN TN AND THE TN VALLEY AS DRIER AIR BEGINS TO
WORK SOUTH FROM THE OHIO VALLEY. EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE
THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH SKIES BECOMING
MOSTLY CLEAR AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES NE AWAY FROM THE REGION.
EXCEPTION MAY BE IN THE EXTREME NE WHERE CLOUDS COULD LINGER UNTIL
AROUND SUNRISE. TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON RUNNING A FEW DEGREES
COOLER THAN EXPECTED BECAUSE OF COLD AIR ADVECTION AND CLOUD COVER
SOMEWHAT UNUSUAL FOR MID AUGUST. LOWS TONIGHT NEAR DEW POINTS IN
THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S WITH MID 50S HIGHER VALLEYS NE AND
MOUNTAINS. PATCHY FOG POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY AROUND AREA LAKES.
TUESDAY WILL BE 5 TO 10 DEGREES WARMER WITH NW FLOW IN DRIER AIR
MASS...NEARLY FULL SUN AND INCREASING THICKNESSES.

&&

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS INDICATE A
SIMILAR SCENARIO IN PUSHING TWO UPPER TROUGHS AND SURFACE COLD
FRONTS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE EXTENDED FORECAST
PERIOD. FIRST FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO TENNESSEE
VALLEY REGION BETWEEN 12-18Z FRIDAY BY GFS...WHILE ECMWF MODEL IS
SLIGHTLY FASTER WITH ITS SOLUTION. FOR NOW...WILL TREND TOWARD A
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFS/ECMWF SOLUTION...AS EXPECT SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND STORMS TO BECOME POSSIBLE TOWARD FRIDAY AM...AS PER THE
GOING FORECAST. WILL KEEP IN CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY...AND SLIGHT
PROBABILITY FOR FRIDAY EVENING. EITHER WAY...THE BOUNDARY SHOULD BE
WEAK...AND DON'T EXPECT MUCH CHANGE...IF AT ALL INVOLVING TEMPS
FOR THE FORECAST AREA AFTER ITS WEAK PASSAGE. 

SECOND BOUNDARY LOOKS TO HAVE BETTER UPPER AIR SUPPORT INVOLVING
THE TROUGH THAT IS EXPECTED TO BUILD SOUTHEAST INTO THE AREA ON
MONDAY. WILL INTRODUCE CHANCE POPS FOR FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY AND
INTO MONDAY EVENING. WILL KEEP FORECAST TEMPS CLOSE TO GFS NUMBERS
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIODS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED JUST AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT THAT IS 
LOCATED NEAR THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AT THIS TIME. THE FRONT IS 
EXPECTED TO BE EAST OF THE AREA SHORTLY AFTER 00Z. THE UPPER TROUGH 
IS SLOW TO MOVE OUT...AND WILL LINGER THROUGH TONIGHT. THIS WILL 
KEEP A SMALL TO SLIGHT CHANCE IN NORTHERN SECTIONS OVERNIGHT...WITH 
PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER AS WELL INTO MONDAY MORNING. DECREASING 
MOISTURE DEPTH AND A LACK OF LIFT BEHIND THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS 
SHOULD MEAN A DRY MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABNORMALLY COOL WITH 
HIGHS IN THE 70S NORTH TO MID 80S SOUTH. DEW POINTS IN THE 50S TO 
LOWER 60S AND A WEST WIND AROUND 10-15 MPH WILL MAKE FOR A VERY 
COMFORTABLE DAY FOR MID AUGUST.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UPPER LOW SHIFTS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
WITH SHOWERS ENDING AND SKIES CLEARING. TUESDAYS LOWS COOL FOR MID 
AUGUST IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S REGION WIDE WITH MID 60S AROUND 
CHA. WITH RISING HEIGHTS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY TEMPERATURES WILL 
WARM A FEW DEGREES TO THE UPPER 70S TO NEAR 90 TUESDAY AND MID 80S 
TO LOWER 90S WEDNESDAY. WEDNESDAYS LOWS SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN 
TUESDAY. THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH BEGINS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS AND WESTERN GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY BUT DOES NOT APPROACH THE 
FORECAST AREA UNTIL WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR THURSDAY. CUT POPS BACK 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH MAIN INCREASE IN MOISTURE THURSDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS NEXT TROUGH BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST LATER SATURDAY

.DISCUSSION...
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS LOCATED OVER OHIO WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD
FRONT STRETCHING ACROSS CENTRAL KY TO WEST TN THIS MORNING. THE 12Z
REGIONAL SOUNDINGS SHOW PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINING
AHEAD OF THE FRONT...WITH A GOOD AMOUNT OF CAPE AVAILABLE. ON THE
OTHER HAND...THE UPPER JET STREAK IS OVER THE AREA THIS
MORNING AND WILL PUSH EASTWARD THROUGH THE DAY...AND INCREASING
DRY AIR ALOFT WILL INHIBIT CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT BY ENTRAINMENT.
LIFT WILL ALSO BE WEAK TODAY WITH NO SIGNIFICANT VORT MAXES NOTED
UPSTREAM IN WV IMAGERY. SO EXPECT THAT CONVECTION WILL BE MAINLY
SCATTERED NORTH TO ISOLATED SOUTH...WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE
CURRENT FORECAST. TEMPERATURES WILL BE TRICKY DUE TO HIGHLY
VARIABLE CLOUD COVER. WILL LOWER TEMPERATURES A LITTLE AND INCREASE
CLOUD COVER SLIGHTLY BASED ON THE AVAILABLE INSTABILITY AND LOW

NORTH...WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE FAR SOUTHWEST.  WITH UPPER TROUGH

EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS MONDAY INTO TUESDAY BUT NOT BEFORE 
ENCOURAGING A FEW MORE SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO ACROSS 
AREAS GENERALLY NORTH OF INTERSTATE 40. THE CHANCE FOR RAIN RETREATS 
FARTHER NORTH AND EAST ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE LATER MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS BEFORE 
ENDING. HEIGHTS BUILD TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WITH DRY WEATHER ALONG 
WITH A WARMING TREND WHICH WILL RESULT IN MAX TEMPS CLOSER TO NORMAL 
AFTER A COOLER START TO THE WORK WEEK. ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH WILL 
HAVE MADE PROGRESS INTO THE MIDWEST BY 00Z WEDNESDAY. MOISTURE WILL 
BE ON THE INCREASE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY AS THE LOW LEVEL 
FLOW BECOMES SOUTHERLY. MODELS INDICATE POSSIBILITY OF AT LEAST A 
COUPLE SHORT WAVE FEATURES DROPPING INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. THEREFORE STAYED WITH AN UNSETTLED PERIOD 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT WITH SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY 
FOR CONVECTION EDGING HIGHER TO CHANCE CATEGORY THURSDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY WHILE DROPPING BACK TO A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. 
TRIED TO KEEP MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA DRY ON SATURDAY WHILE

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION... 

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
SYNOPTIC LIFT WILL BE INCREASING THROUGH THE EVENING AS AN UPPER
TROUGH NOW OVER THE UPPER MS VALLEY WILL SWING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS AND THE POSITION OF
THE 300 MB JET OVER KY-WV WILL BRING THE BEST LIFT INTO THE AREA
AFTER MIDNIGHT. SO AFTER THIS INITIAL ROUND OF SCATTERED DIURNALLY-
DRIVEN CONVECTION ENDS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS...EXPECT THAT SHOWERS
WILL REDEVELOP TOWARD MIDNIGHT. THE PASSAGE OF A SURFACE COLD FRONT
LOOKS TO BE DELAYED UNTIL LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. WITH THE
UPPER TROUGH SLOWING DOWN AND LINGERING OVER THE APPALACHIANS...WE
WILL CONTINUE TO SEE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH SUNDAY...WITH THE
BEST CHANCES NORTHEAST. BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUD COVER NORTH SHOULD
HOLD TEMPS BACK TO THE 70S AND LOWER 80S...WITH MID TO UPPER 80S
SOUTH WHERE MORE SUN MAY BREAK THROUGH. THE TROUGH AXIS AND THE
SURFACE FRONT MOVE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS SUNDAY NIGHT...LOWERING
POPS BACK TO A LOW/SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH WITH NO POPS SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVES SLOWLY EAST MONDAY TO THE EAST COAST BY 
MONDAY EVENING. COLD AIR ALOFT AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY ON THE BACK SIDE 
OF THE TROUGH COMBINED WITH SOME INSTABILITY WILL BE ENOUGH FOR A 
FEW SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS FROM KNOXVILLE NORTH MONDAY 
MORNING AND JUST EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA LATER IN THE DAY. COOLER

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
SYNOPTIC LIFT WILL BE INCREASING THROUGH THE EVENING AS AN UPPER
TROUGH NOW OVER THE UPPER MS VALLEY WILL SWING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS AND THE POSITION OF
THE 300 MB JET OVER KY-WV WILL BRING THE BEST LIFT INTO THE AREA
AFTER MIDNIGHT. SO AFTER THIS INITIAL ROUND OF SCATTERED DIURNALLY-
DRIVEN CONVECTION ENDS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS...EXPECT THAT SHOWERS
WILL REDEVELOP TOWARD MIDNIGHT. THE PASSAGE OF A SURFACE COLD FRONT
LOOKS TO BE DELAYED UNTIL LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. WITH THE
UPPER TROUGH SLOWING DOWN AND LINGERING OVER THE APPALACHIANS...WE
WILL CONTINUE TO SEE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH SUNDAY...WITH THE
BEST CHANCES NORTHEAST. BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUD COVER NORTH SHOULD
HOLD TEMPS BACK TO THE 70S AND LOWER 80S...WITH MID TO UPPER 80S
SOUTH WHERE MORE SUN MAY BREAK THROUGH. THE TROUGH AXIS AND THE
SURFACE FRONT MOVE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS SUNDAY NIGHT...LOWERING
POPS BACK TO A LOW/SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH WITH NO POPS SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MOVES SLOWLY EAST MONDAY TO THE EAST COAST BY 
MONDAY EVENING. COLD AIR ALOFT AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY ON THE BACK SIDE 
OF THE TROUGH COMBINED WITH SOME INSTABILITY WILL BE ENOUGH FOR A 
FEW SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS FROM KNOXVILLE NORTH MONDAY 
MORNING AND JUST EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA LATER IN THE DAY. COOLER 
TEMPERATURES ONCE AGAIN MONDAY BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...ABOUT THE
SAME AS SUNDAY. CLOUD COVER AND A PRECIPITATION ACROSS NE TN AND SW

.DISCUSSION...
SHOWERS OVER MIDDLE TN THIS MORNING ARE MOVING EAST TOWARD OUR
AREA...BUT WITH THE ENVIRONMENT MORE STABLE IN EAST TN...DO NOT
EXPECT THAT THE COVERAGE OR INTENSITY OF THESE SHOWERS WILL
INCREASE. COMPARING THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING TO RUC SOUNDINGS AT CHA
AND TYS...THE MIDLEVELS ARE WARMER AND DRIER OVER EAST TN. CAPE IS
WEAK THIS AFTERNOON AND SOME CIN REMAINS IN PLACE. EXPECT THAT
PRECIP TODAY WILL BE MAINLY ON THE EASTERN AND WESTERN FRINGES OF
THE CWA. SO THE CURRENT FORECAST OF LOW CHANCE POPS IN THE PLATEAU
AND MOUNTAINS WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE VALLEY LOOKS GOOD.
OBSERVED TEMPS AND THE LATEST MODEL GUIDANCE ARE IN LINE WITH THE
CURRENT FORECAST...SO NO UPDATE WILL BE NEEDED.

TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY 
FAR.  
 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...EASTERN GREAT LAKES UPPER 
TROUGH DIGS SOUTHEAST INTO THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE DAY. LAPSE 
RATE SHOULD INTENSIFY WITH COLDER AIR BUILDING IN ALOFT WITH THE 
RATHER DEEP UPPER SYSTEM. THIS WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. ADDITIONAL ENERGY BUILDS SOUTH THROUGH 
THE BACK SIDE OF THE TROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY SO HELD ONTO

COOL/WET PATTERN. MODELS TRY TO BREAK DOWN THE RIDGING FOR MID WEEK 
A BIT BUT HELD ONTO A DRY PERIOD TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WHILE

SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE DRIVES TOWARD THE BASE OF THE TROUGH RIPPING

20-30 PERCENT POPS FOR TODAY WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE SOUTH
NEARER THE BOUNDARY. CLOUDS EXPECTED TODAY SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES
A BIT COOLER THAN WEDNESDAY SO STAYED NEAR THE BLEND TEMPERATURES
FOR TODAY. THE DISTURBANCE EXITS THE REGION TONIGHT SO KEEP LOW

LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED

PLACED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM IN THE HIGH 
TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER THIS EVENING AS FRONT SHIFTS 
EAST. DRIER AIR SPILLING IN BEHIND FRONTAL BOUNDARY CURRENTLY 
PRESSING ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY. THE DRY ADVECTION CONTINUES ON 
WEDNESDAY WITH A WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPPING INTO THE AREA. 
STAYED RATHER CLOSE TO GUIDANCE MINS TONIGHT AND MAXES ON 
WEDNESDAY.  

&&

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FIRST IN A SERIES 
OF BOUNDARIES WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY 12Z 
THURSDAY. WILL INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR WESTERN AND 
NORTHWEST PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT/EARLY 
THURSDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR EXPECTED PROXIMITY OF WIDELY SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND/OR THUNDERSTORMS. WILL FURTHER INCREASE PRECIP CHANCES 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THURSDAY FOR THE FORECAST AREA AS 
PER TRENDING FROM GFS/NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS AND EXPECTED INCREASE 
IN MOISTURE/INSTABILITY ACROSS THE AREA. WILL ONLY UP POPS SLIGHTLY 
INTO HIGHER CHANCE CATEGORY AT THIS TIME. 

UPPER TROUGH IN UPPER MIDWEST WILL ALLOW FOR VORT MAX AT 500
MILLIBARS AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONT TO MOVE SOUTHEAST IN
NORTHWEST FLOW INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY. HAVE UPPED POPS
SLIGHTLY AT THIS TIME INTO HIGHER CHANCE CATEGORY TO ACCOUNT FOR
CONTINUED MODEL AGREEMENT TO THIS SOLUTION. 

THE TIMING OF THE NEXT NORTHWEST FLOW EVENT MAY BE TRICKIER THAN
THE INITIAL TWO SYSTEMS. MODELS ARE NOT AS CLEAR CUT INVOLVING THE
THIRD EXPECTED NORTHWEST FLOW EVENT. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE
PRECIP PROBABILITIES FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY TO ACCOUNT
FOR THIS FRONT. PROGRESSIVE UPPER FLOW SHOULD CONTINUE INTO NEXT

PRECIP CHANCES TODAY. HOWEVER...SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY STILL PROGRESSING
STEADILY SOUTHEAST THROUGH CENTRAL KENTUCKY AT MID MORNING WHICH
MAY ACTIVATE WITH SOME HEATING THIS AFTERNOON. THE PROBLEM IS THE MASS
OF MID LEVEL CLOUD BUILDING IN FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE MAY CAP OFF
HEATING TO SOME DEGREE LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY
AVAILABLE. SATELLITE REVEALS DECENT LOOKING SHORT WAVE FEATURE
MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OF ALABAMA. SUPPOSE WITH THIS WAVE
IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD...WILL LEAVE SCATTERED POPS AT 50 PERCENT
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WHILE
EDGING POPS BACK 10-15 PERCENT FARTHER NORTH. THE THREAT FOR SEVERE
CONVECTION APPEARS TO BE LOWER TODAY WITH BETTER LIFT/INSTABILITY
POSITIONED ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. SHOULD PROBABLY TWEAK TEMPS BACK
A LITTLE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY... 
WITH A MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL SEVERAL CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES AROUND THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS 
MORNING...BUT THE MAIN STORY TODAY SHOULD BE THE MESOSCALE 
CONVECTIVE SYSTEM EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. 
THIS MCS IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS...WITHIN THE NORTHWESTERLY UPPER- 
LEVEL FLOW OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. MODELS INDICATE THAT A 
MODERATELY TO POTENTIALLY HIGHLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL BE IN PLACE 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...SO THINK THERE WILL BE A BETTER POTENTIAL 
FOR SEVERE WEATHER THAN IN PREVIOUS DAYS. THE MAIN THREATS APPEAR TO 
BE DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
CONTINUE TO TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...SINCE TEMPS WILL BE VERY 
DIFFICULT TO PREDICT DUE TO THE DIFFERENT POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE TIMING.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON 
AMPLIFICATION OF WAVE PATTERN OVER THE U.S.  BY THE START OF THIS 
PERIOD TUESDAY MORNING...THE AMPLIFICATION HAS ALREADY STARTED... 
WITH THE UPPER RIDGE DRIFTING WWD...AND THE GREAT LAKES TROUGH 
STRENGTHENING.

TWO FRONTAL SYSTEMS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA...THE FIRST ONE LOOKS 
TO PASS TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH THE SECOND FRONT PASSING AROUND 
SATURDAY OR SUNDAY.  BOTH FRONTS PUSH WELL THROUGH THE AREA AND 
ALLOW DRIER AIR TO FILL INTO THE AREA FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS.  BY 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...THE FIRST FRONT HAS SETTLED TO NEAR GULF 
COAST...AND SURFACE RIDGE STILL IS HOLDING LOCALLY INTO FRIDAY 
EVENING...BUT AROUND SATURDAY THE RETURN FLOW STARTS GETTING BACK 
INTO THE AREA...AND WITH THE FRONT APPROACHING MOISTURE RETURNS 
ALONG WITH A PRETTY GOOD CHANCE OF STORMS.  SEVERITY OF STORMS WILL 
BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT UPON WHAT TIME THE STORMS WILL FORM AND FRONTAL 
PLACEMENT.  TUESDAY'S STORMS ARE LIKELY TO FORM WELL AHEAD OF 
FRONT...SIMPLY FROM DIRUNAL HEATING OF THE INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS. BY THE TIME THE FRONT ARRIVES IT MAY NOT HAVE MUCH INSTABILITY 
ALONG IT.

FOR TEMPERATURES...GENERALLY WENT AT OR BELOW GUIDANCE VALUES...MORE 
BELOW ON MINS...THINKING THAT POST-FRONTAL AIR MASS WILL COOL DOWN 
MORE THAN MODELS ARE FORECASTING.

1003 AM EDT SUN AUG 7 2011

.DISCUSSION...ONGOING CONVECTION HAS AFFECTED MOST OF SW VA AND NE 
TN ALREADY THIS MORNING...BUT WILL EXIT THESE AREAS SHORTLY. 
UPSTREAM CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL KY IS WEAKENING...AS 
NOTED BOTH ON RADAR AND WARMING TOPS ON INFRARED SATELLITE PICS. 

AIRMASS IS NEARLY UNCHANGED FROM YESTERDAY AND UPPER RIDGE IS ALSO 
IN SAME POSITION. MODIFIED 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS REVEAL SLIGHTLY 
LESS INSTABILITY TODAY...GENERALLY AROUND 1200 J/KG FOR REACHING 80S 
TO LOWER 90S. STILL AT LEAST A WEAK CAPPING INVERSION TO OVERCOME...
SO APPEARS THAT CONVECTION TO OUR WEST SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AS 
IT MOVES EAST AT 15 TO 20 MPH. 

BASED ON ALL OF THE ABOVE...I WON'T RAISE POPS TO LIKELY FOR NRN 
AREAS...BUT MAY PUT MORE OF A POP GRADIENT FROM HIGHER NORTH TO 
LOWER SOUTH. WILL STAY IN CHANCE CATEGORY WITH SCATTERED WORDING.

MIDNIGHT SHIFT UNDERCUT THE HOTTER GFS MOS MAXES...WHICH LOOKS GOOD. 
GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS WILL BE FRESHENED AROUND 15Z.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY... 
WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60 TO LOWER 70S LINGERING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. RADAR AND SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME CONVECTIVE 
COMPLEXES DEVELOPING OVER THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY ALONG THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY THIS MORNING. THIS CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED 
TO MOVE EASTWARD TODAY...LIKELY TRIGGERING ADDITIONAL CONVECTION 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. FOR NOW...WILL KEEP POPS IN THE HIGH CHANCE 
RANGES SINCE THE AXIS OF BEST INSTABILITY IS PROGGED TO REMAIN NORTH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA IN THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
CONTINUE TO TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON 
OVERALL PATTERN THROUGH THE LONG TERM...BUT DISAGREE ON DETAILS. 
UNSETTLED PATTERN EARLY IN THE LONG TERM GRADUALLY SETTLES DOWN BY 
MID WEEK AS BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN CONUS SLOWLY 
AMPLIFIES. BEST CHANCE OF PRECIP APPEARS TO BE ON TUESDAY AS SURFACE 
BOUNDARY SWINGS THROUGH THE AREA. CONTINUED DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE 
LATTER PORTION OF THE WORK WEEK AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO 
THE REGION. MODELS ARE HINTING AT AN UNSEASONABLY AMPLIFIED TROUGH 
DIGGING INTO THE EASTERN CONUS BY LATE NEXT WEEKEND BUT WILL HAVE TO 
WAIT TO SEE IF THIS ACTUALLY MATERIALIZES. CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEKEND IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS PATTERN SHIFT. 
SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER AIR FOLLOWS SURFACE BOUNDARY BY MID WEEK 
RESULTING IN TEMPS COOLING SLIGHTLY BACK TO NEAR CLIMO. GENERALLY 
DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN AREA OF CONVECTION ON
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU CONTINUES TO MOVE SE INTO THE CENTRAL AND SRN
VALLEY AREAS. ELSEWHERE...AIR MASS HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY TO
MODERATELY UNSTABLE OVER NE TN AND SW VA...SO THERE IS POTENTIAL
FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED NEW CONVECTION TO DEVELOP. KEPT OUR
LIKELY POPS GOING IN MOST AREAS UP TO 07/00Z...AND THEN JUST CHANCE
POPS AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS. CLOUD COVER AND ANY LINGERING CONVECTION
FAVORS MILD MOS MINS...WHICH ACTUALLY DIFFER VERY LITTLE.

PATTERN CHANGES VERY LITTLE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH WEAK
TROUGHING ALOFT KEEPING A SLIGHT NW TO SE FLOW TO STEER ANY
DEVELOPING CONVECTION. TOUGH CALL ON HOW MUCH CONVECTION DOES OCCUR
ON SUNDAY...BUT I LIKED THE CHANCE NORTH TO LOW LIKELY POPS SOUTH
LOOK OF MODELS...WHICH ALSO BLENDED BEST WITH FFC AND GSP GRIDS.

DIURNAL CONVECTION LOOKS POSSIBLE JUST ABOUT ANYWHERE ON MONDAY SO
KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS CHANCE POPS. OTHERWISE...MILD MINS
EACH NIGHT AND COOLER THAN THE GFS MOS MAXES EACH DAY (NOTE HOW
MUCH TOO WARM GFS MOS WAS FOR TODAY'S HIGHS).


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...EASTERN STATES UPPER 
TROUGH AMPLIFIES ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH MID WEEK AS NUMEROUS 
SHORT WAVES DROP SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE MIDWEST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. A COOL FRONT WILL BE MAKING ITS WAY SOUTH THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AND LEFT HIGHEST CHANCE POPS FROM PREVIOUS 
PACKAGE FOR THE SLOW FRONTAL PASSAGE...REDUCING PROBABILITY TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE ON WEDNESDAY. DRIER AIR FILTERS INTO THE REGION BEHIND 
THE FRONT THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK SO MAINTAINED THE DRY 
FORECAST UNTIL SATURDAY WHEN ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL IMPULSE BUILDS INTO 
THE REGION. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME RANGE KEPT THE 
PROBABILITY AT 20 PERCENT. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO MEX MOS 
GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH THE LONG TERM.

OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. KMRX RADAR SHOULD BE BACK UP WITHIN THE
HOUR. MORE ORGANIZED CONVECTION HAS BEEN MOVING EAST OVER MIDDLE TN
AND THIS ACTIVITY MAY REACH THE SRN VALLEY COUNTIES BEFORE 06/00Z.
NUDGED POPS UP FOR THAT AREA...AND KEPT POPS IN CHANCE CATEGORY
OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE REGION.

SHORTWAVE TROUGH...PLUS WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SRN AREAS AND 
SURFACE TROUGH TO OUR NW SATURDAY...SHOULD ALL EQUATE TO GOOD CHANCE 
TO LIKELY POPS FOR SATURDAY. STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS POP AND 
WEATHER GRIDS...WITH HIGHER QPF GRIDS THAN BEFORE. 

COVERAGE OF CONVECTION MAY DROP OFF SOME SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN BOTH 
GFS AND NAM SHOW ANOTHER SHORTWAVE IMPULSE TO INCREASE CONVECTION ON 
SUNDAY. STAYED BELOW LIKELY POPS FOR NOW ON SUNDAY. 

FOR TEMPS...MINOR MOS DIFFERENCES ON MINS WERE TWEAKED CONSIDERING 
AMOUNT OF CLOUDS AND LIGHT SW WINDS FOR SPOTS SUCH AS TYS. HAD TO 
UNDERCUT THE HOTTER GFS MAX TEMPS EACH DAY...GIVEN HIGHER RAIN 
CHANCES.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...FADE POPS FROM LOW
CHANCE  TO SLIGHT CHANCE BY 06Z MONDAY WITH DEPARTURE OF MID SOUTH
SHORT WAVE TROUGH. MAINTAINED THE TREND OF LOWER POPS ON MONDAY
BEHIND THIS WAVE. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW SEVERAL SHORT WAVE
FEATURES BUILDING SOUTHEAST FROM THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH SYNOPTIC
FRONTAL BOUNDARY DROPPING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. KEPT HIGHEST
CHANCE POPS GOING ON WEDNESDAY WITH BOUNDARY IN PLACE. BY THURSDAY
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL HELP TO PUSH THE FRONT SOUTH OF THE FORECAST
AREA BUT SOME UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING AND POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL
WAVES BUILDING INTO THE AREA. THEREFORE KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP
FOR CONVECTION THROUGH EVENING WHILE DROPPING ENTIRELY ON FRIDAY
WITH COOL FRONT WELL SOUTH OF THE REGION. MEX MOS WAS
UNREALISTICALLY WARM CONSIDERING RE-EMERGENCE OF EASTERN STATES
UPPER TROUGH WITH ASSOCIATED ACTIVE WEATHER. WENT A FEW DEGREES
BELOW SUGGESTED NUMBERS...ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE.

20-24Z SO WENT WITH A VCNTY THUNDER AT 20Z TRENDING TO PREVALING
THUNDER AT 22Z. OPTED TO LEAVE THUNDER OUT AT TYS AT THIS TIME
AWAITING BETTER CHANCE ON SATURDAY AS LIFT INCREASES WITH OHIO
VALLEY SHORT WAVE. APPLIED A VICINITY THUNDER AT CHA AND TYS
AT 14Z FOR THIS FEATURE. CONVECTION MAY INITIATE BEYOND THE TAF
PERIOD AT TRI SO LEFT OUT FOR NOW. WITH CI AND AC INCREASING
OVERNIGHT DON'T BELIEVE FOG WILL BE TOO WIDESPREAD. PLACED MVFR 
VSBY REDUCTION AT TRI TOWARD MORNING.

.DISCUSSION...NO CONVECTION CURRENTLY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA... 
ALTHO ORGANIZED ACTIVITY UPSTREAM OVER WRN TN AND SW KY IS MOVING 
EAST. MODIFIED 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW SLIGHT TO MODERATE 
INSTABILITY FOR REACHING 80S TO MID 90S...WITH AT LEAST A WEAK CAP 
TO OVERCOME. SURFACE BOUNDARY IS SHOWN TO OUR SOUTH WITH DEW POINT 
TEMPS GENERALLY IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S. WINDS ALOFT VERY WEAK 
WITH ALMOST NO SHEAR INDICATED. GIVEN ALL OF THIS...WILL CONTINUE 
WITH JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE AREA TODAY.

COVERAGE LOOKS TO INCREASE ON SATURDAT AS SHORTWAVE APPROACHES AND A 
SURFACE TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE SRN OHIO VALLEY. I MAY INCREASE 
SATURDAY POPS A BIT MORE WITH THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

FORECAST GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS LOOK ON TRACK...BUT I WILL UPDATE 
ZFPMRX TO REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL

REMAIN HIGH NORTH OF THIS BOUNDARY OVER THE FORECAST AREA. LIGHT FOG 
AT KTYS AND KTRI THIS MORNING SHOULD QUICKLY EVAPORATE AS THE SUN

SLOWLY ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THESE TWO TRIGGERING MECHANISMS 
SHOULD COMBINE TO PRODUCE SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON... 
WITH A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION EXPECTED TONIGHT. FOR NOW...

BOUNDARY OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO 
SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHWARD TODAY...WITH AN WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
DRIFTING SLOWLY EASTWARD ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THESE TWO 
TRIGGERING MECHANISMS SHOULD COMBINE TO PRODUCE SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION 
EXPECTED TONIGHT AS THE UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE FURTHER AMPLIFIES 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL AN INVERTED-V PROFILE 
IN THE LOWER LEVELS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE 
LAYER OF DRY AIR ALSO EXPECTED IN THE MID LEVELS. THUS...THINK THAT 
DAMAGING MICROBURST WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH ANY TSTORM THAT 
FORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS 
THE COOLER NAM NUMBERS FOR TODAY...SINCE THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF 
HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON EMANATING FROM THE 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OVER THE WESTERN TN RIVER VALLEY. THESE COOLER 
TEMPS SHOULD KEEP HEAT INDICES BELOW HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA OVER THE 
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED WEATHER 
WITH A SLOW COOLING TREND IN THE OFFING THROUGH THE LONG TERM AS 
LOW-AMPLITUDE UPPER TROUGH DISPLACES NEARLY ZONAL FLOW OVER THE 
EASTERN CONUS. MEDIUM-RANGE MODELS DEPICT SERIES OF WEAK UPPER 
DISTURBANCES TRANSLATING THROUGH THE FLOW. MODELS DIFFER ON DETAILS 
HOWEVER. APPEARS BEST COVERAGE OF PRECIP WILL BE EARLY IN THE LONG 
TERM (SATURDAY) AS ABUNDANT MOISTURE ACCOMPANIES INITIAL UPPER WAVE. 
BUMPED UP POPS TO LIKELY FOR OUR NORTHEASTERN ZONES ON SATURDAY. 
OVERALL HOWEVER...DID NOT MAKE MANY CHANGES TO PRECEDING

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
CONVECTION MAINLY TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA TODAY...WITH DEBRIS 
CLOUDS KEEPING INTENSE SUN AT BAY...SO CANCELED THE HEAT ADVISORY.

UPPER RIDGE THAT HAS BEEN THE DOMINATING FEATURE FOR MUCH OF THIS 
SUMMER OVER THE SOUTHERN U.S. IS STILL IN PLACE...WITH US LOCATED ON 
THE NORTHEASTERN EDGE.  GOING INTO THE WEEKEND...OUR PART OF THE 
RIDGE YIELDS AS WEAK DISTURBANCES MOVE INTO THE AREA.  WILL KEEP THE 
FORECAST DRY FOR NOW THROUGH FRIDAY...BUT SHORTWAVE MOVING INTO THE 
AREA FRIDAY NIGHT SHOULD SPREAD SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE AREA 
AS ELEVATED INSTABILITY WILL PROVIDE FUEL.  ANOTHER DISTURBANCE ON 
THE HEELS OF THIS ONE SHOULD PROVIDE LIFT FOR SATURDAY AS WELL.  FOR 
TEMPERATURES...KEEPING PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE VALUES...WITH MORE 
CLOUDS AND PRECIP...SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER ON SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...IT APPEARS THAT THE 
MOIST SUMMER PATTERN WILL CONTINUE IN THE LONG TERM AS MODELS AGREE 
HEIGHTS GRADUALLY FALL THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH MEAN UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH IN PLACE ACROSS THE MUCH OF THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION 
BY 12Z FRIDAY. IN THIS PATTERN THE JET STREAM BECOMES INCREASINGLY 
ACTIVE WITH MODELS INDICATING SEVERAL SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES 
BUILDING THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. SOLUTIONS DIFFER ON EXACT TIMING OF THESE FEATURES. COULD 
ALMOST KEEP A 30 PERCENT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION GOING THROUGH THE 
ENTIRE FORECAST BUT TRIED TO PICK A COUPLE PERIODS WITH HIGHER 
PROBABILITY. KEPT 40 PERCENT PROBABILITY IN FOR SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY AS MODEL AGREEMENT FAVORS THIS TIME WITH A LEAST A COUPLE 
CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS ACTING ON HIGH WEEKEND MEAN RH AND INSTABILITY. 
KEPT LOWER SLIGHT/LOW CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY WHILE 
FORECAST AREA AWAITS DEEPENING EASTERN STATES UPPER TROUGH WITH 
ADDITIONAL VORTS DROPPING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. A SYNOPTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACCOMPANIES THIS ACTION LATER 
WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME 
RANGE JUST KEPT A 30 PERCENT POP GOING WHILE DROPPING TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE ON THURSDAY AS BOUNDARY SLIPS SOUTH OF THE TENNESSEE BORDER.

.DISCUSSION...NAM MODEL SEEMS TO HANDLE THE APPROACHING MCS OVER SE 
IN/SW OH THIS MORNING. LATEST MESOSCALE DISCUSSION EXPECTS THIS 
ACTIVITY TO DROP S-SE AND WEAKEN BEFORE REACHING SE KY/SW VA. POSSIBLE 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY COULD HELP TO FOCUS SCATTERED NEW CONVECTION THIS 
AFTERNOON. MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING YIELDS LOTS OF INSTABILITY BUT 
MINIMAL SHEAR. FREEZING LEVEL AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS ARE VERY 
HIGH...SO MAIN THREAT WILL BE ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS WITH STRONGEST 
CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HWO PRODUCT HIGHLIGHTS THIS 
THREAT. 

CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS COULD AFFECT HOW FAST TEMPS WARM OVER SW VA 
AND NE TN...BUT PREVIOUS MAX TEMPS LOOK GOOD...AND SHOULD BE RIGHT 
AROUND RECORD VALUES. WILL TWEAK A FEW HOURLY GRIDS AROUND 11 AM EDT

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE STILL FIRMLY IN
CONTROL OF FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. A WEAK FRONT WAS MOVING INTO
THE OHIO VALLEY WITH MCS OVER INDIANA AND OHIO. EARLY MORNING
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 60S TO MID 70S WITH CLEAR SKIES AND
SOME PATCHY FOG. UPPER RIDGE WILL RETROGRADE TO THE WEST TODAY AS
FRONT MOVES SOUTHEAST. MCS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO MOVE
SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES
BUT OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM THIS ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY MOVE INTO SW
VA AND NORTHEAST TN THIS AFTERNOON AND COMBINED WITH THE UNSTABLE
AIR MASS FROM HEATING PROVIDE A FOCUS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
THAT SHOULD DEVELOP SOUTHWARD INTO THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS.
DAMAGING WINDS AND SOME LARGE HAIL WILL BE POSSIBLE. THICKNESS
VALUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE HIGHER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY BUT WITH
POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER WILL
FORECAST HIGHS LIKE TUESDAYS WHICH WILL BE NEAR OR AT RECORDS FOR
THE DATE. WILL ISSUE SPS FOR HEAT INDEX VALUES AROUND 100 OR HIGHER
FOR THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEYS BOTH TODAY AND THURSDAY.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LARGE UPPER RIDGE
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL U.S. GRADUALLY RETREATS TO THE
WEST THROUGH THE PERIOD. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES INTO THE AREA
FROM THE NORTH EARLY WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND WEAK SURFACE WAVE
LINGERING ALONG SOUTHERN BORDER OF MRX THU AND FRI. SLIGHT CHANCE
OF THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE GA BORDER THU AND FRI. SLGT CHC TSTMS
ALSO FOR EASTERN HIGHLANDS FRI. AIR MASS MOISTENS UP WITH INCREASING
CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION ON SAT AND SUNDAY AS COLD FRONT DEVELOPS
NW OF THE AREA. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIFFER INTO NEXT WEEK PENDING TRACK
OF TROPICAL SYSTEM EMILY. BEST BET FOR NOW IS NW LAYER FLOW AND
DRIER CONDITIONS ACROSS TN VALLEY AND S APPALACHIANS. LOW LEVEL
THICKNESS VALUES ALSO PROGGED TO FALL. WELL ABOVE NORMAL...THOUGH
BELOW RECORD TEMPS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND THEN FALL TO
NEAR NORMAL BY END OF PERIOD.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A FAIRLY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA (AT LEAST COMPARED TO LAST WEEK BEFORE THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE). WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS EXPECTED

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
REMAINS IN NORTHWEST FLOW AROUND UPPER RIDGE THAT PERSISTS OVER THE 
SOUTH CENTRAL CONUS. AFTER ANOTHER DRY NIGHT...A WEAK SURFACE 
BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. 
MOISTURE AND LIFT NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE WITH THIS FEATURE PER
MODEL TIME HEIGHTS. HAVE CONTINUED ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CWA TOMORROW AFTERNOON. MAV AND MET
GUIDANCE TEMPS DISPLAY A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE FOR MAX
TEMPS TOMORROW. HAVE TENDED TO USE BLEND OF GUIDANCE ALTHOUGH
TIMING OF CLOUDS/POTENTIAL PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH BOUNDARY WILL
HAVE A CRITICAL IMPACT ON THOSE TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 2 INCHES AND A WEAK BOUNDARY 
CROSSING THE AREA WILL KEEP CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING INTO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A 850 MB TROUGH EXTENDING ACROSS THE MID ATLANTIC 
TO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS WILL ADVECT DRIER AIR INTO NORTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE AREA THURSDAY. THE NAM AND GFS DIFFER ON THE 
SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE DRY AIR. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WETTER GFS AND 
SREF AND HAVE POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS THURSDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. A SLIGHT RISE IN PW VALUES AND A 500 MB SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH CROSSING THE OHIO VALLEY COULD BRING AN ISOLATED SHOWER 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...MAINLY IN THE MOUNTAINS. BETTER PRECIP CHANCES 
COME ON SATURDAY WITH A MORE SIGNIFICANT MIDLEVEL TROUGH. SUNDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY WILL FEATURE A NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT IN WHICH 
UPSTREAM CONVECTIVE DISTURBANCES COULD BRING SHOWERS TO THE 
AREA...BUT CONFIDENCE THIS FAR OUT IS LOW...SO WILL NOT MAKE MUCH 
CHANGE TO THE FORECAST. 

TEMPS THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD WILL REMAIN HOT...WITH HIGHS IN 
THE MID TO UPPER 90S IN MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY. HEAT INDEX VALUES OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. WILL DOMINATE WEATHER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION.  THE RESULT WILL BE A QUIET WEATHER PATTERN WITH 
HOT AND DRY CONDITIONS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL 
SETTLE INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY TO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  WITH INCREASING 
MOISTURE OVER THE REGION...EXPECT TO SEE SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION AS 
THE BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH.  DUE TO MODEL DIFFERENCES...CONFIDENCE 
LOW FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.  HOWEVER...OVERALL PATTERN LOOKS 
TO BECOME UNSETTLED WITH A COUPLE OF WEAK SHORT WAVES EXPECTED TO 
MOVE THROUGH.  THEREFORE...MADE LITTLE CHANCE TO CURRENT FORECAST 
AND CONTINUED WITH 20 TO 30 POPS THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO SHOW HIGH DEWPOINTS IN THE 70S 
OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT SOME DRIER AIR APPEARS TO BE 
FINALLY WORKING ITS WAY INTO SOUTHWEST VA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TN. 
ISOBARIC ANALYSIS WOULD INDICATE THAT A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WAS 
LOCATED SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA OVER CENTRAL AL AND CENTRAL GA... 
BUT DEWPOINT ANALYSIS WOULD SUGGEST THAT THE PRIMARY SURGE OF DRIER 
AIR HAS ONLY JUST BEGUN TO FILTER INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THUS... 
WILL LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR A FEW MORE HOURS 
THIS EVENING...BUT WILL THEN UPDATE LATER THIS EVENING TO REMOVE THE 
POPS. WILL ALSO PLAN TO MENTION PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT... 
SINCE MINS SHOULD BE CLOSE TO THE DEWPOINTS BY SUNRISE. TEMP 
FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...SO WILL NOT PLAN TO 
TWEAK THIS EVENING.

FOR THE SHORT TERM WITH A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY

MOISTURE STARTS TO INCREASE BY WEDNESDAY AS ANOTHER WEAK SURFACE 
BOUNDARY APPROACHES. THINGS BECOME LESS CERTAIN BY WEEK'S END AS

SOUNDING. ABOVE CLIMO CONVECTIVE CHANCE REMAINS TODAY ACROSS MRX

OVERNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR MOVES IN 
BEHIND SUNDAY/S WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY PASSAGE.  STRONG UPPER RIDGE 
REBUILDS IN ACROSS THE CENTRAL U.S...PUTTING THE MRX CWA IN 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW.  THIS WEATHER PATTERN WILL PERSIST OVER THE ARA

DIURNAL THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON.  MODEL CONSISTENCY POOR ON DETAILS DURING THE LATER PART

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED QUASI- 
STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE CENTRAL PART OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...AT LEAST ACCORDING TO THE ISOBARIC ANALYSIS. HOWEVER...IT 
REMAINS DIFFICULT TO LOCATE THIS BOUNDARY OTHERWISE...SINCE TEMPS 
AND DEWPOINTS REALLY DO NOT FALL MUCH BEHIND THIS BOUNDARY. AREA 
RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING ALONG THIS 
BOUNDARY THIS EVENING...BUT THIS CONVECTION CONTINUES TO WEAKEN WITH 
THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. THIS BOUNDARY IS NOT EXPECTED TO MOVE 
MUCH TONIGHT...SO THINK IT IS PRUDENT TO LEAVE SOME LOW CHANCE POPS 
IN THE FORECAST OVERNIGHT. 

CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR THE MOST PART...BUT WILL 
PLAN TO UPDATE THIS EVENING TO MENTION SOME PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING 
AFTER MIDNIGHT.

THIS AREA KEEPING THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT TO A MINIMUM MAINLY AT
CHA BUT IMPACT ALSO NOTED AT TYS. THE ATMOSPHERE HAS RECHARGED TO
SOME EXTENT AROUND THESE TERMINALS BUT AM BANKING ON THE BEST
CHANCE OF SEEING SOME PRECIP IN THE FORM OF A SHOWER AND PERHAPS A
BIT OF THUNDER AT TYS IN A COUPLE HOURS AS AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY
SLIPS SLOWLY SOUTH THROUGH NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THIS SAME BOUNDARY
APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO TRI SO ADDED A LITTLE PERIOD OF
THUNDERSHOWERS HERE EARLY THIS EVENING. DECIDED TO LEAVE FOG OUT AT
TYS AND CHA WITH SCT-BKN MID AND HIGH DECK POSSIBLY KEEPING THE
SURFACE FROM BECOMING SATURATED LATE TONIGHT. SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY
SHOULD BE IN PLACE NEAR TRI AND TYS AROUND 13-14Z SUNDAY SO
MAINTAINED VCNTY TSRA AROUND THIS TIME WRAPPING UP AROUND EARLY

BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY SAGS SOUTH DURING THE PERIOD. LOW 
LEVEL RIDGING AND WEAK NORTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPS OVER THE AREA. THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SURFACE AND MID LEVEL RIDGE
OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY WEAKEN OVERNIGHT AND INTO SATURDAY. A
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED BY NAM/GFS MODELS TO MOVE SLOWLY
SOUTHEAST TOWARD AND INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST
AREA BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON.

WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE OF STORMS IN FORECAST FOR SATURDAY
AFTERNOON. HAVE LOWERED POPS FOR SATURDAY JUST SLIGHTLY IN
AREA...AS MODELS ARE COMING IN DRIER...AND NOT AS MUCH COVERAGE ON
RADARS TO THE NORTH AND AROUND MRX THIS AFTERNOON.

MADE ONLY VERY MINOR CHANGES TO GOING TEMP FORECAST. 


LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS STILL GENERALLY 
AGREE THAT A SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL PUSH SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION EARLY NEXT WEEK ALLOWING FOR AT LEAST A FEW 
GENERALLY DRY DAYS. DEWPOINTS MAY FALL SLIGHTLY BEHIND BOUNDARY... 
BUT TEMPS EXPECTED TO REMAIN ABOVE CLIMO. REGION PROJECTED TO REMAIN 
IN NORTHWESTERLY FLOW BUT MOISTURE BEGINS TO INCREASE AGAIN BY MID 
WORK WEEK. THUS HAVE CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE LATTER 
PORTION OF THE LONG TERM. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY TENDED TO SLIGHTLY 
UNDERCUT MAV/MEX GUIDANCE SINCE THE MEX GUIDANCE REPRESENTS THE 
HIGHEST VALUE OF THE ENSEMBLE MEMBERS FOR THE MOST PART.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL EXTEND 
FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SOUTHEAST OFF THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC 
COAST TODAY. THE RIDGE SHOULD SUPPRESS CONVECTION ACROSS MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...SOUTH TO SOUTHEASTERLY LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
ADVECTION WILL BE IN PLACE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA. OROGRAPHIC LIFT IN THIS AREA ALONG WITH WEAK 
INSTABILITY MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A 
THUNDERSTORM. ANY CONVECTION THAT FORMS SHOULD BE ENDING BY AROUND 
00Z FRIDAY LEADING TO ANOTHER UNEVENTFUL EVENING. THE HEAT WILL BE 
ON AGAIN TODAY WITH THE UPPER HIGH POSITIONED OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A MID-UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
CENTERED OVER THE CAROLINAS ON FRIDAY WILL RETROGRADE TO THE PLAINS 
THROUGH SUNDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN A NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT THAT 
WILL ALLOW DISTURBANCES GENERATED BY UPSTREAM CONVECTION TO DROP OUR 
WAY. ON FRIDAY THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE IN SOUTHERN AREAS AS 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BEGINS TO ADVECT NORTHWARD. BY SATURDAY 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE NEAR 2 INCHES ACROSS MOST OF THE 
AREA...WHICH CONTINUES INTO SUNDAY. WILL CARRY HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. A WEAK COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO THE AREA SUNDAY 
NIGHT AS THE FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED. DRIER AIR BUILDS IN 
ON MONDAY...WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE DRY WEATHER THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE

SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDING SOUTH FROM THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. NORTHEASTERLY FLOW RESULTS IN DRIER AIR 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH NEARLY FULL INSOLATION AND NO CHANCE 
FOR CONVECTION. FOG SHOULD BURN OFF BY 14Z MOST AREAS. STAYED 
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS TODAY AND

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...NOT MANY CHANGES WILL BE 
NEEDED TO THE LONG TERM PERIOD. THE GENERAL TREND OF INCREASING POPS 
THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK FOLLOWED BY A FROPA ON MONDAY WILL BE 
CONTINUED WITH ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS. ON THURSDAY THE MID-UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE OVER THE CAROLINAS...ALLOWING INCREASING 
MOISTURE FROM A SOUTHERLY FLOW TO BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE 
SOUTH. THE RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AND RETROGRADES THROUGH SUNDAY...AND A 
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BRING A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES TOWARD THE AREA 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. BEST PRECIP CHANCES LOOK TO BE SUNDAY AS THE 
SURFACE FRONT DRAWS NEAR...BUT WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE 
THIS FAR OUT. DRIER AIR SHOULD FILTER IN BEHIND THE UPPER TROUGH AND

MODEL SOLUTION FOR THE MID TO LONG TERM PERIODS...SO I TRENDED QUITE 
CLOSE TO PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL 
LIFT NE BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...THEN THE UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDS EAST. MOISTURE INCREASES...ESPECIALLY OVER SRN AREAS WITH 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES THERE LIKELY TO REACH OR EXCEED 2 INCHES 
BY FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. ONE FACTOR WILL BE THE NEXT FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WHICH LOOKS TO DROP INTO NRN AREAS BY EARLY SUNDAY...AND 
OTHER FACTOR WILL BE WEAK SHORTWAVES/IMPULSES...THAT WOULD BOTH 
ENHANCE RAIN CHANCES. BEST RAIN CHANCES STILL APPEAR TO BE SATURDAY 
INTO SUNDAY...BUT I DID TWEAK POPS UP VERY SLIGHTLY ON FRIDAY TO

OTHERWISE...KEPT MOST AREAS DRY MONDAY AND I SAW NO REASON TO 
INTRODUCE ANY RAIN CHANCES FOR NEW DAY 7 (TUESDAY). MOS MIN TEMPS 
GENERALLY QUITE REASONABLE AND FOLLOWED. HOWEVER...THINK THAT GFSX

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
DRY AIR ALOFT HAS MOVED INTO THE AREA BEHIND A SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH...BUT LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS PRODUCING PATCHY FOG 
AND LOW CLOUDS. EXPECT THAT THE CLOUDS AND FOG WILL LIFT QUICKLY 
AFTER SUNRISE...LEAVING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES BY LATE MORNING. WITH 
DAYTIME MIXING...THE DRIER AIR ALOFT WILL REACH THE 
SURFACE...DROPPING DEWPOINTS INTO THE 60S...WHICH WILL MAKE FOR A 
MORE COMFORTABLE DAY DESPITE HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S. 
SUBSIDENCE UNDER A BUILDING MIDLEVEL RIDGE WILL SUPPRESS CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT. THIS RIDGE SHIFTS EASTWARD ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...KEEPING DRY WEATHER IN PLACE WITH HIGHS MAINLY IN THE 
90S. ONCE THE RIDGE BECOMES POSITIONED OVER THE CAROLINAS ON 
THURSDAY...A RETURN FLOW OF MOISTURE WILL RAISE DEWPOINTS AND BRING 
A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MAINLY 
SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
STAYED BASICALLY WITH PREVIOUS PACKAGE FORECAST FOR THIS PERIOD.
ATMOSPHERE GETS RECHARGED WITH HIGHER DEWPOINT AIRMASS BY FRIDAY AS
MOISTURE WORKS NORTH AND EAST AROUND 85H SOUTHEASTERN ATLANTIC
COASTAL RIDGE. INSTABILITY ALSO EDGES HIGHER SO STAYED WITH THE
SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION ON FRIDAY. BY SATURDAY...UPPER
TROF PROGRESSES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN STATES WITH NORTHWESTERLY
FLOW DEVELOPING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MODELS REVEAL THE
POSSIBILITY OF SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES DROPPING SOUTHEAST FROM
THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE FORECAST AREA SO BROAD BRUSHED 30 PERCENT
POPS SATURDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WHILE KEEPING THE HIGHEST
CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AS SYNOPTIC COOL FRONT BUILDS TOWARD THE
REGION ENHANCING PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION. STAYED WITH THE
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR
DAYTIME PERIOD MONDAY AS BOUNDARY MAY STILL BE IN THE VICINITY.
ONLY MADE MINOR TWEAKS TO TEMP FORECAST DURING THE LONG TERM. MEX
MOS GUIDANCE ONCE AGAIN APPEARS TO BE TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH MAX TEMPS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...WILL CONTINUE TO SEE CONVECTION 
DEVELOP AND MOVE ACROSS THE MRX CWA INTO THE EVENING HOURS AS A 
WEAK...DIFFUSE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIDES INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION.  WITH ABUNDANT LEVEL MOISTURE IN PLACE...CONVECTION WILL BE 
ABLE TO GENERATE HEAVY RAINFALL WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALIZED 
MINOR FLOODING.  DRIER AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE BOUNDARY...WITH 
PRECIP EXPECTED TO END FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT.  COULD 
SEE A FEW DIURNAL SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OVER HIGHER TERRAIN ON 
TUESDAY...HOWEVER MOST LOCATIONS SHOULD BE DRY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS STILL OFFERING 
SOME DRIER AIR LASTING INTO WEDNESDAY...SO LIMITED POPS TO JUST THE 
SRN AREAS TUESDAY NIGHT...AND JUST SE TN AND SW NC WEDNESDAY. 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY LIFTS NE OF THE REGION THURSDAY...AND 500 MB 
HEIGHTS RISE AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS EAST. THIS SHOULD SET THE STAGE 
FOR MOSTLY DIURNAL CONVECTION...PERHAPS MORE ORGANIZED ON SAT AND 
SUN...SO POPS FOR THOSE TWO PERIODS WERE INCREASED SLIGHTLY WITH 
SCATTERED WORDING. MODELS GENERALLY EASE ANOTHER WEAK FRONT ALMOST 
THROUGH THE REGION ON MONDAY...SO DRY EXCEPT FOR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR SE TN/SW NC NEAR GSP AND FFC FOR MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A MIDLEVEL TROUGH PRODUCING LIFT IN A VERY MOIST AIR MASS WILL 
PROVIDE NUMEROUS TO OCCASIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE 
AREA TODAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE WELL OVER 2 INCHES AS 
THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. TIMING OF THE 
BEST LIFT APPEARS TO BE 16-22Z...AND WILL HAVE LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL 
POPS IN THAT TIME FRAME...ALONG WITH A MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL. MORNING SHOWERS AND CLOUD COVER WILL LIMIT SURFACE HEATING 
WITH HIGH IN THE 80S...AND LIMIT THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE STORMS. 
STRONG DOWNBURST WINDS CANNOT BE RULED OUT...BUT THE MAIN THREAT 
WILL BE HEAVY RAINFALL. PASSAGE OF THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH AROUND 00Z 
WILL BRING A QUICK END TO PRECIP IN THE EVENING...AND WILL DROP ALL 
POPS AFTER 06Z. STILL...THE SURFACE FRONT LAGS WELL BEHIND THE 
TROUGH...SO LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL LIKELY KEEP LOW CLOUDS 
AND FOG IN PLACE THROUGH THE NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE BOUNDARY SHIFTS SOUTH BY
TUESDAY...BUT STILL CHANCE FOR SOME DIURNAL CONVECTION ON TUESDAY.
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN PROVIDING MOSTLY DRY WEATHER FOR
WEDNESDAY...MAY SEE A FEW AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP OVER
HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT MOST AREAS WILL REMAIN DRY FOR WEDNESDAY. A
BOUNDARY ENTERS THE AREA THURSDAY AND LINGERS INTO SUNDAY. WILL
KEEP THE LOW POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THURSDAY

THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH MORE ORGANIZED CONVECTIVE 
ACTIVITY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY MOVING SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE 
FORECAST AREA. OUTFLOW FROM THIS UPSTREAM ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY HELP 
TO TRIGGER A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION TONIGHT OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA...SO WILL RAISE POPS A LITTLE FOR TONIGHT. MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY WILL SLOWLY BREAK DOWN 
TONIGHT...WITH A NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL PUSH THE WEAK COLD 
FRONT TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...WITH CONVECTION BECOMING 
MORE WIDESPREAD AND ORGANIZED OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL LIKELY BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY AROUND THE TN RIVER

GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MAXES ON MONDAY... 
AND WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE. OVERALL...WILL TREND 
TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST (ESPECIALLY WITH MINS) SINCE THIS 
NEXT COLD FRONT IS NOT EXPECTED TO BRING MUCH OF A CHANGE IN THE

MOVING CONVECTION DURING THE PERIOD. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE UPPER- 
LEVEL HIGH OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY WILL BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN ON 
SUNDAY...WITH A NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPING BY SUNDAY 
NIGHT. THIS NORTHWEST FLOW SHOULD LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN INSTABILITY 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...RESULTING IN STRONGER 
CONVECTION. THIS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT IS ALSO PROGGED TO PUSH A WEAK 
COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...SO WILL RAISE POPS 
INTO THE LIKELY CATEGORY SINCE THE MODELS AGREE THAT CONVECTION WILL 
BE MORE WIDESPREAD AND ORGANIZED WITH THIS FRONT. AS FOR TEMPS... 
WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WITH A SLIGHT COOLING TREND WITH MAXES DUE TO THE 
EXPECTED INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER AND COVERAGE OF CONVECTION.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...ISOLATED CONVECTION MAY 
LINGER INTO TUESDAY WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY SETTLING SOUTH OF THE 
MRX AREA. AN UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR WEDNESDAY 
AND THURSDAY. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE OVER HIGHER TERRAIN 
BUT EXPECT GENERALLY DRY AND CONTINUED HOT CONDITIONS. CONFIDENCE 
LOW BY THE END FOR THE PERIOD...THOUGH EXPECT THE REMNANTS OF THE 
BOUNDARY TO LIFT BACK NORTH INTO THE AREA FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY... 
SLIGHTLY INCREASING THE CHANCE OF CONVECTION.

GULF MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO FEED INTO THE AREA TODAY AS A

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
OVER THE MID WEST...WITH A LEE TROUGH EXTENDING ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AN ELONGATED UPPER-LEVEL 
HIGH CENTERED OVER THE OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS WILL CONTINUE TO 
BRING STAGNANT CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH HOT 
AND HUMID CONDITIONS LINGERING IN THESE 'DOG DAYS OF SUMMER'. AREA 
RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER SOUTHEAST KY AND 
NORTHEAST TN ASSOCIATED WITH A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVELY-INDUCED VORTEX 
THAT CONTINUES TO SLOWLY SINK SOUTHWARD FROM THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 
THIS MCV SHOULD HELP TO TRIGGER A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION 
TODAY...ESPECIALLY AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...AS A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPS IN THE AFTERNOON. PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES WILL ALSO BE HIGH (~2 INCHES)...SO LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL 
APPEARS TO BE A THREAT THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH ANY SLOW- 
MOVING CONVECTION. MAXES THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD BE A DEGREE OR TWO 
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...ALTHOUGH THE BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION 
SHOULD KEEP TEMPS FROM RISING MUCH HIGHER.

WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS 
MORNING TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS...AND 
TO REMOVE ANY MORNING PRECIP WORDING.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN CONCERN TODAY WILL BE THE
RETURN OF HIGH HEAT INDICES BETWEEN 100-105 DEGREES BY THIS
AFTERNOON. WILL ISSUE ANOTHER SPS HEADLINING THE EXTREME HEAT. AN
UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. NAM-GFS DOES
SHOW A WEAK DISTURBANCE MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. MAIN
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE SHORT-RANGE MODELS IS THE AMOUNT OF
MOISTURE. GFS HAS PWS NEAR 1.5 INCHES WHILE THE NAM HAS PWS AT OR
ABOVE 2 INCHES. GIVEN BNA SOUNDING NEAR 2 INCHES AND WATER VAPOR
SHOWING PLENTY OF MID-HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE...WILL TREND TOWARD THE
WETTER NAM MODEL. PLAN OF GOING FOR HIGH CHANCE POPS WITH LIKELY
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AS THE WEAK WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE REGION.

MAIN CONCERN WITH THE CONVECTION WILL BE TORRENTIAL DOWNPOURS AND
LOCALLIZED DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS.

DUE TO THE MOISTURE...TRENDED TOWARD THE NAM HIGHS AND LOWS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE LOOKS QUITE 
DOMINANT INTO AT LEAST SATURDAY...WITH MOISTURE REMAINING HIGH AND 
DAYTIME HEATING TO TRIGGER AT LEAST DIURNAL CONVECTION. HOWEVER...
LACK OF A SYNOPTIC SCALE FEATURE LEAVES ME QUESTION GOING ANY HIGHER 
THAN CURRENT RAIN CHANCES INTO THE WEEKEND. SO...I STAYED CLOSE TO 
THE GENERALLY LOWER GFS MOS POPS THROUGH SATURDAY...AND BELOW THE 
21/0ZZ GFSX MOS POPS (WHICH CONTINUE TO TREND A BIT HIGHER) THROUGH 
SUNDAY NIGHT. 

BY MONDAY...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION...WHICH HELPS TO EASE A WEAK COLD FRONT SOUTHWARD 
TOWARD THE TN VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS. THERE IS SOME CONTINUITY 
ON THIS FRONT DROPPING THROUGH SW VA AND NE TN BY TUESDAY MORNING. 
PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED GOOD...BUT I DID NUDGE MONDAY POPS UP 
TO 50 PERCENT AND PUT MY SCATTERED AREAL QUALIFIER IN AGAIN. 
CONTINUED LOWER POPS TUESDAY...ESPECIALLY FOR NRN AREAS...AND KEPT 
WEDNESDAY DRY. 

DID NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM 20/12Z OR 21/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS...OTHER

OVERALL...A STAGNANT PATTERN IS EXPECTED THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH 
HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS LINGERING IN THESE 'DOG DAYS OF SUMMER'. 
CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVELY-INDUCED 
VORTEX OVER THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH IS 
PROGGED TO SLOWLY SINK SOUTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY TOMORROW. 
THIS MCV SHOULD HELP TO TRIGGER A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ON 
THURSDAY...ESPECIALLY AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...AS A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPS IN THE AFTERNOON. PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES WILL ALSO BE HIGH (~2 INCHES) THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...SO 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE A THREAT THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS... 
SINCE ANY CONVECTION SHOULD BE SLOW-MOVING. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH THE FORECAST 
PERIOD...BUT THINK MAXES SHOULD BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER TOMORROW 
(COMPARED TO TODAY).

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING 
GENERALLY MAINTAINS POSITION AND STRENGTH THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
WEEKEND SUPPRESSING WIDESPREAD CONVECTION. PROGS STILL SHOW ENOUGH 
MOISTURE ON WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW TO KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS 
GOING FOR CONVECTION DURING THIS PERIOD. BY MONDAY...RIDGE HAS 
UNDERGONE RETROGRESSION AS UPPER TROUGH DROPS SOUTHEAST FROM THE 
GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY AND THROUGH THE NORTHEASTERN STATES BY TUESDAY 
NIGHT. SURFACE FRONT AIDED BY THE STRENGTHENING NORTHERLY FLOW 
BUILDS SLOWLY INTO THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT 
GENERATING SCATTERED CONVECTION. KEPT MEDIUM CHANCE POP JUST UNDER 
50 PERCENT FOR NOW AWAITING BETTER TIME RESOLUTION IN THE NEXT 
COUPLE DAYS. KEPT THE PREVIOUS PACKAGE IDEA OF SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
NORTH AND LOW CHANCE POP SOUTH ON TUESDAY AS FRONT SLIPS FURTHER 
SOUTH TOWARD THE GEORGIA BORDER. BY WEDNESDAY...THE FRONT MAY HAVE  
SHIFTED SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR 
CONVECTION ACROSS PART OF SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA DUE TO NEARBY SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY. NEW MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE 
NOT TOO FAR OFF ON THE WARM SIDE OVER THE WEEKEND BUT REALLY BECOMES 
UNREALISTIC DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. UNDERCUT BY 
SEVERAL DEGREES MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS NORTHERLY FLOW ADVECTS 
SOMEWHAT COOLER AIR INTO THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL
DOMINATE THE SHORT TERM WITH AIRMASS DRYING OUT SOME TODAY (MAINLY
MID-LEVEL DRYING...NOT SURFACE DEWPOINTS). HOWEVER...ENOUGH
INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH THE BEST CHANCES OVER THE MOUNTAINS
AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST DUE TO DEEPER MOISTURE.

IN THE VERY SHORT TERM...WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION FROM A DYING
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX IS CONTINUING TO PRODUCE THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE
NORTH CAROLINA-TENNESSEE STATE-LINE. THIS ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY
PERSIST THROUGH 9 AM. OTHERWISE...PATCHY FOG WILL ONCE AGAIN BE THE
RULE THIS MORNING...ESPECIALLY AREAS THAT RECIEVED RAIN OVERNIGHT.

AFTERNOON HEAT INDICES WILL BECOME AN INCREASING CONCERN DUE TO THE
PERISTENT MOISTURE AND HOT AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES. HEAT INDICES
NEAR 100 DEGREES ANTICIPATED TODAY...THEN 100-105 DEGREES THURSDAY
AND FRIDAY. WE WILL ISSUE A SPS CONCERNING THE HOT TEMPERATURES
LATER THIS MORNING.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE CENTERED 
ACROSS THE MISSISSIPI VALLEY REGION WILL MOVE VERY LITTLE THROUGH 
SUNDAY. PATTERN LOOKS TO SUPPORT MOSTLY DIURNAL CONVECTION...BUT ANY 
ACTIVITY MOVING THROUGH OR AROUND THE UPPER RIDGE COULD ALSO AFFECT 
THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. I DO LIKE THE LOWER POPS ON THURSDAY... 
AS TIME HEIGHT SECTIONS SHOW A DECREASE IN MOISTURE IN THE 700 TO 
400 MB LAYER...SO LESS UNSTABLE WITH NOT A SIGNIFICANT FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT.

POPS FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY LOOKED GOOD...BUT I DID NUDGE POPS UP 
JUST SLIGHTLY FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...DUE TO THE APPROACHING 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. TEMPS SHOULD STAY A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE 
CLIMO...AND PREVIOUS GRIDS WERE GENERALLY IN LINE WITH 20/12Z GFSX 
MOS. MOST MODELS SEEM TO EASE THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY JUST SOUTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY...BUT I LEFT THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH 
TO CHANCE POPS SOUTH IN FOR NOW. KEPT TUESDAY NIGHT DRY. UNDERCUT

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FIRST CLUSTER OF THUNDERSTORMS
DROPPING SOUTH AROUND THE UPPER RIDGE HAS WEAKENED...AND WILL ONLY
SPREAD A FEW HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE AREA. HOWEVER...2 MORE COMPLEXES
UPSTREAM CONTINUE TO DEVELOP OVER NORTHERN PARTS OF THE OHIO
VALLEY. THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD REACH SW VA AND NE TN BY
12Z TO 15Z. PREVIOUS WEATHER/POP GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK FOR TODAY
WITH LITTLE CHANGES MADE. CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS CONVECTION
SHOULD KEEP HIGHS THIS AFTERNOON BELOW THE HOTTER GFS MOS (ALTHO
GFS MOS FINALLY DID WELL ON MAX TEMPS MONDAY). 

WON'T RULE OUT A STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE STORM TODAY...BUT WIND
FIELDS ARE RATHER WEAK. HOWEVER...INSTABILITY AND DIVERGENCE ALOFT
ARE FAVORABLE,

FOR TONIGHT...SLIGHT CHANCE EVENING POPS LOOKED REASONABLE. MOS
MINS CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...AS WE START THE MEDIUM 
RANGE FORECAST A STRONG RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DOMINATE THE MID-SECTION OF THE NATION. ONLY FORCING WILL BE LOCAL 
TERRAIN...SO WILL KEEP HIGHEST POPS THERE FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY. UPPER RIDGE SLOWLY WEAKENS THROUGH THE WEEK AND MOISTURE 
INCREASES...SO WILL CALL FOR A SLOW INCREASE IN POPS.

FOR SATURDAY..GFS SHOWS A WEAK FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
THEN TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA FOR SUNDAY. WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN 
CHANCE POPS INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS BOUNDARY BECOMES QUASI-STATIONARY 
OVER THE AREA FOR MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM...
(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MOST OF THE RADAR ACTIVITY HAS 
BEEN ALONG THE PLATEAU BUT THAT AREA IS HAS BEEN WEAKENING. MAY SEE 
A STILL SEE A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS 
DURING THE EVENING HOURS...SO WILL LEAVE LOW POPS FOR THAT AREA. A 
SHORTWAVE IS EXPECTED TO BRING BETTER COVERAGE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS LATE TONIGHT AND ESPECIALLY TUESDAY. HIGHEST CHANCE 
WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA WHERE THE BEST 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED. MAY SEE A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE 
STORMS IN THOSE AREAS ON TUESDAY. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE 
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT WERE CLOSE SO 
DIDN'T STRAY TOO FAR. WITH THE RAIN AND CLOUDS...STAYED NEAR THE 
MET/MAV BLEND TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER RIDGE FORECAST 
TO BUILD EAST OVER THE AREA DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE 
PERIOD...WHICH MAY HELP TO LIMIT CONVECTION FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY.  STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE SOME INSTABILITY...SO WILL 
CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS.  MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE A BIT LATE IN THE 
PERIOD...WITH ECMWF MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH EASTERN TROUGH AND 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT THAN GFS.  HOWEVER...EVEN GFS HAS FRONT 
SAGGING SOUTH TOWARD THE AREA BY MONDAY...AND DOES APPEAR 
MOISTURE WILL INCREASE ALONG WITH MORE CONVECTION...SO WILL CARRY 
LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY.  GFS MOS TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...AND INDICATE A RETURN TO VERY HOT 
CONDITIONS AT LEAST FOR THE WED THROUGH FRIDAY TIME FRAME.  TEMPS 
MAY LOWER A BIT BY LATE IN PERIOD ASSUMING MORE CLOUDS/CONVECTION.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOULD STAY RAIN FREE THIS MORNING

WILL UNDERCUT GFS MOS MAXES AGAIN TODAY AND LEAN TOWARD THE SLIGHTLY 
COOLER NAM-WRF MOS. 

A STRAY STORM OR TWO COULD LINGER INTO THE EVENING HOUR..BUT MODELS 
DEVELOP MORE CONVECTION LATE TONIGHT TO OUR NW. THIS ACTIVITY COULD 
REACH PARTS OF SW VA AND THE NRN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU IN THE 06Z-12Z.

TUESDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON. STEEP LAPSE RATES AND HIGH DEW

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DEW POINT TEMPS LOWER THAN 24 
HOURS AGO...BUT PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL. UPPER 
RIDGE BUILDING EAST INTO THE REGION WON'T BE AS FAVORABLE FOR 
CONVECTION...BUT SOME INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON WITH HIGHS HITTING 
80S TO AROUND 90 DEGREES. THUS...STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS POP GRIDS
IN THE 20 TO 30 PERCENT RANGE...MOSTLY FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. 

MAX TEMPS HAVE BEEN ON THE COOL SIDE AND GFS MOS HAS BEEN WELL OFF 
THE MARK...ESPECIALLY AT TRI (GFS MOS 10 DEGREES TOO WARM FOR 
SATURDAY). GFS MOS LOOKS A FEW DEGREES TOO HIGH AGAIN TODAY...SO I 
TRENDED CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM MOS FOR HIGHS. MOS MINS TONIGHT 
QUITE CLOSE WITH NO REASON TO STRAY FROM.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE CENTERED OVER
THE CENTRAL PLAINS EXTENDS EAST TO INCLUDE MOST OF THE OHIO AND TN
VALLEYS MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT SO NOT MUCH CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU
FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON. TUESDAY THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD
UPPER FLOW MORE NW WITH RIDGE STILL CENTERED TO THE WEST. DRIER
AIR MASS MONDAY WITH INCREASED THICKNESSES AND MORE SUN SO FOLLOWED
TREND OF WARMER TEMPERATURES AS UPPER RIDGE STRENGTHENS OVER THE
EASTERN STATES. FOR TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY WILL CONTINUE 20 TO 30

PICS SHOW A WEAK 700-500 MB TROUGH AXIS MOVING EAST OVER THE
FORECAST AREA TODAY. NOT SURE HOW MUCH SURFACE REFLECTION WILL
OCCUR AS THIS MID LEVEL TROUGH WEAKENS...BUT SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO
SUPPORT HIGHER THAN CHANCE POPS FOR AT LEAST WESTERN AND SOUTHERN

ABOVE NORMAL). CLOSER TO NORMAL OVER SW VA AND NE TN...SO WILL RUN
CHANCE POPS THOSE AREAS. WILL UNDERCUT THE WARMER GFS MOS MAXES AND
GO CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA...WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS RANGING FROM THE MID 60S TO THE LOWER 
70S. ISOBARIC ANALYSIS WOULD INDICATE THAT A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WAS 
LOCATED SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH 
EXTENDING NORTH ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. ALTHOUGH IT'S HARD TO 
BELIEVE THAT A FRONTAL BOUNDARY HAS PASSED THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA...A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO LINGER OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. THUS...WILL PLAN TO KEEP SOME CHANCE POPS 
IN THE FORECAST OVERNIGHT. IN ADDITION...WILL PLAN TO MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SOME PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.AVIATION...STILL A FEW SHOWERS AND EVEN A COUPLE THUNDERSTORMS
AROUND EARLY THIS EVENING WITH MOIST ATMOSPHERE PRESENT ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. WOULD EXPECT MUCH OF THE PRECIPITATION AT OR
NEAR THE TERMINALS WILL FADE AFTER 02Z LEAVING BEHIND HIGH HUMIDITY 
IN THE LOW LEVELS. FOR THIS REASON ADDED SOME MVFR FOG IN THE
CLIMATOLOGICALLY FAVORED PERIOD FROM AROUND 08-13Z. MODELS INDICATE
HEALTHY MOISTURE ADVECTION CONTINUES IN THE LOW LEVELS OFF THE
ATLANTIC OCEAN. A SURFACE TROUGH WILL REMAIN IN THE AREA AND 
THE PRESENCE OF WEAK UPPER LEVEL WAVES DROPPING SOUTHEAST AROUND
THE PERHIPHERY OF THE CENTRAL U.S. RIDGE WILL AID LIFT DURING THE
DAY. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO DECENT COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. THEREFORE USED A PREVAILING TSRA GROUP DURING THE
AFTERNOON AT EACH TERMINAL. MAINTAINED MVFR OR BETTER FLIGHT 
CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR INCREASED CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS INTO FRIDAY. WILL STILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY POPS FOR

.DISCUSSION...
CONVECTION HAS EXITED THE CWFA AS WEAK FORCING FROM MCV AND OUTFLOW
BOUNDARY MOVED OUT. COULD STILL SEE SOME ISOLATED ACTIVITY OVERNIGHT
WITH LINGERING INSTABILITY SO WILL HOLD ONTO LOW POPS. WILL
MAINTAIN NE- SW POP GRADIENT ON THURSDAY WITH THE HIGHEST POPS IN
THE DEEPER MSTR AROUND CHATTANOOGA. MAV TEMPS LOOK GOOD TNGT BUT
HAVE UNDERCUT A BIT THURSDAY GIVEN RECENT TRENDS.

RECENT MODEL TRENDS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE DEEPER MOISTURE LINGERING
OVER THE AREA FRI-SATURDAY IN ASSOCIATION WITH INVERTED TROF/ESE
LLVL FLOW. RAISED SKY AND POPS AREA WIDE...ALTHOUGH DID NOT PUSH
POPS INTO THE LIKELY CATEGORY JUST YET. ALSO LOWERED TEMPS ACROSS THE
BOARD THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

BEYOND THE WEEKEND DEEP RIDGING REALLY TAKES OVER ACROSS THE
CENTRAL AND EASTERN US. OUR UPPER LVL FLOW SHIFTS TO MORE OF A
NORTHEASTERLY DIRECTION WHICH ALONG WITH THE RIDGING WILL HELP
SUPPRESS CONVECTION FURTHER SOUTH. FOR THE MON-WED PERIOD WE ARE
ADVERTISING A SLOW WARMING TREND ALONG WITH MAINLY AFTN POPS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...NOT AS WARM TODAY AS EXPECTED 
AS CLOUD COVER FROM MORNING THUNDERSTORMS KEPT NORTHEAST HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA ONLY RISING INTO THE 80S AND PLACES FARTHER WEST ON 
THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY AND MOUNTAINS HAD THUNDERSTORMS 
DEVELOP BY MID AFTERNOON IN THE VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS. TEMPERATURES 
REACHED THE LOWER 90S ONLY IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY. HAVE CANCELLED 
HEAT ADVISORY FOR KNOXVILLE AREA BUT KEPT IT IN EFFECT FOR 
CHATTANOOGA AND SURROUNDING COUNTIES WHERE VALUES EARLIER TODAY 
REACHED ABOVE 100. FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL SAG SOUTHWARD LATER TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
AND BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE TN VALLEY. MCS ACTIVITY NOW 
OVER SOUTH CENTRAL KY AND A NEW AREA DEVELOPING OVER MO WILL LIKELY 
AFFECT THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY MORNING BY LEAVING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT 
ON THE BOUNDARIES SIMILAR TO THIS MORNINGS STORMS. WITH THAT IN MIND 
HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT AND 40 TO 
50 PERCENT POP WEDNESDAY AS FRONT MOVES INTO NORTHERN TN. KEPT 
TEMPERATURES MILD OVERNIGHT AND A BLEND OF MAV AND NAM FOR HIGHS 
NEAR 90 TO THE MID 90S. WITH CLOUD COVER AND OVERNIGHT STORMS THESE 
MAY EVEN BE TOO HIGH. WILL LET SPS EXPIRE FOR THE HEAT AT 00Z BUT 
MIDNIGHT SHIFT MAY WANT TO REISSUE FOR SOUTHERN SECTIONS WHERE HEAT 
INDEX VALUES MAY REACH OVER 100 ONCE AGAIN.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT A STAGNANT BUT CONVECTIVELY ACTIVE PATTERN WILL 
LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. AN UPPER-LEVEL 
HIGH IS PROGGED TO BECOME CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS BY 
THURSDAY...WHICH WILL CREATE A NORTH-TO-NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL 
FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN WILL BE 
CONDUCIVE FOR A FEW MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS FROM THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION TO EVENTUALLY AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA. A WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY AT THE SURFACE IS PROGGED TO MOVE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA INTO THE DEEP SOUTH BY THURSDAY...BUT THINK THAT THIS SCENARIO 
IS TOO OPTIMISTIC GIVEN THE TIME OF YEAR AND THE FACT THAT THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN SHOULD SLOW ITS SOUTHWARD PROGRESS. WITH A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP EVERY AFTERNOON/EVENING AROUND 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY...SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD DEVELOP MOST EVERY 
DAY ALONG WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME MCS ACTIVITY ORIGINATING FROM 
THE NORTH. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS NUMBERS 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD IN REGARDS TO MINS...BUT WILL TREND 
SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH MAXES SINCE THAT HAS BEEN THE VERIFYING TREND 
LATELY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT RADAR SHOWS CONVECTION 
SINKING SOUTH OVER NORTHERN AREAS.  MODELS INDICATE UPPER RIDGE WILL 
BEGIN TO WEAKEN OVER THE AREA DURING THE SHORT TERM.  LOOKS LIKE 
CAPE VALUES WILL BE HIGHER TODAY...AND WITH RESIDUAL OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES AROUND LOOKS LIKE BETTER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION.  WILL 
CARRY CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES TODAY...AND CHANCE NORTHERN TWO THIRDS 
TONIGHT.  TEMPS PROBLEMATIC...AS WILL BE QUITE SENSITIVE TO CLOUDS 
AND ANY PRECIP. MAV TEMPS LOOK ON THE HIGH SIDE...UNLESS 
CONVECTION/CLOUDS ARE LESS THAN EXPECTED.  FOR NOW WILL GO WITH A 
MAV/MET BLEND FOR HIGHS...BUT WILL STAY CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS FOR LOWS. 
RECORD TEMP AT TRI FOR TODAY LOOKS TO BE THE MOST VULNERABLE.  
RECORDS FOR TODAY ARE 104 AT CHA...104 AT TYS...AND 93 AT TRI. HEAT 
ADVISORY STILL LOOKS REASONABLE...SO WILL LEAVE AS IS FOR NOW...WITH 
SPS FOR OTHER AREAS.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE 
FORECAST FOR THE EXTENDED.  OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN STILL ON TRACK 
WITH UPPER RIDGE SHIFTING WEST...PUTTING THE MRX CWA IN A GENERALLY 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT.  A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE IN AND REMAIN  
QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE AREA FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD AS WELL.  THE 
END RESULT WILL BE AN UNSETTLE WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED.  BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION WILL BE WEDNESDAY AS THE 
BOUNDARY SETTLES INTO THE AREA.  WITH THE BOUNDARY IN PLACE...

315 PM EDT MON JUL 11 2011

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...ANOTHER HOT DAY ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 90S AND EXPECTED TO REACH 
THE UPPER 90S IN SOME PLACES. TRI WILL LIKELY TIE OR BREAK THE OLD 
RECORD OF 95 SET IN 1988. HEAT INDEX VALUES ARE OVER 100 AT CHA AND 
AROUND 100 IN THE KNOXVILLE AREA. LOWER DEW POINTS IN NE TN AND SW 
VA HAVE KEPT HEAT INDEX VALUES BELOW 100. VERY LITTLE SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY AT MID AFTERNOON BUT WITH STRONG HEATING 
EXPECT SOME ACTIVITY TO DEVELOP NEXT FEW HOURS. MCS OVER OHIO IS 
MOVING SE AND COULD REACH SW VA OR PUT OUT OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES ACROSS 
EASTERN KY THAT WILL AFFECT SW VA OR NE TN LATE TONIGHT. HAVE CHANCE 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THAT AREA LATER TONIGHT. A FEW COULD 
BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE WITH HIGH WINDS THE MAIN THREAT. TONIGHT 
TEMPERATURES ONLY DROP TO LOW TO MID 70S. TUESDAY MORE HEAT WITH 
RIDGE STILL OVER TN VALLEY. TEMPERATURES AS HOT OR A DEGREE WARMER 
WITH HIGHER DEW POINTS EXPECTED SO ISSUED HEAT ADVISORY FOR 
KNOXVILLE SOUTH TO CHATTANOOGA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE 
MORE NUMEROUS BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AS COLD FRONT NOW MOVING INTO MID 
MS VALLEY AND WESTERN GREAT LAKES MOVES ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO 
KY. THE HOT TEMPERATURES MAY DROP BELOW ADVISORY LEVELS BEFORE 
EVENING IF THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP BY AFTERNOON IN THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN VALLEY. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A STAGNANT PATTERN WILL LINGER OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY IS PROGGED TO RETROGRADE NORTHWESTWARD INTO THE 
MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND CENTRAL PLAINS BY THE END OF THE WEEK... 
WHICH WILL CREATE A NORTH TO NORTHWEST UPPER-LEVEL FLOW OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY AT THE SURFACE WILL LIKELY 
REMAIN SOMEWHAT STATIONARY AROUND THE TN RIVER VALLEY THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...CREATING A CONVECTIVELY ACTIVE PATTERN FOR THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED 
EVERY AFTERNOON/EVENING AROUND THE TN RIVER VALLEY...SCATTERED 
CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE MOST EVERY DAY WITH A FEW ORGANIZED MCS 
SYSTEMS ALSO AFFECTING THE AREA FROM THE MID WEST REGION. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD IN REGARDS TO MINS...BUT WILL TREND SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH 
MAXES SINCE THAT HAS BEEN THE VERIFYING TREND LATELY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE OVER
THE AREA FOR THE SHORT TERM...WITH VERY HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS
AGAIN TODAY. MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE...SO HIGH TEMPS MAY APPROACH
RECORD VALUES. RECORDS FOR TODAY ARE 100 AT CHA...99 AT TYS...AND
95 AT TRI. WILL MENTION NEAR RECORD HIGHS ALL ZONES IN THE
FORECAST. HEAT INDEX VALUES WILL LIKELY REACH TO BETWEEN 100 AND
105 IN MANY CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY LOCATIONS...AND MAY
APPROACH 100 IN MANY OTHER VALLEY AREAS. WHILE STILL BELOW HEAT
ADVISORY CRITERIA...THIS CONCERN WILL BE ADDRESSED IN AN SPS. WHILE
MODELS INDICATE CAPES WILL BE AGAIN BE UNIMPRESSIVE...THERE SHOULD
BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION AGAIN...SO WILL
INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE GFS/ECMWF HAVE GENERALLY
DONE WELL MAINTAINING CONSISTENCY WITH THE EXTENDED FORECAST FOR
THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. THEREFORE...HAVE NOT MADE ANY MAJOR CHANGES
OTHER THAN CONTINUING TO SLIGHTLY TWEAK PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS BACK ON TUESDAY AS UPPER RIDGE REMAINS IN PLACE WHILE
ADJUSTING POPS HIGHER DURING THE WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT
TIME FRAME AS SHORTWAVE ENERGY CONTINUES TO BUILD THROUGH THE
NORTHEASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH. TROUGH AMPLIFIES AS IT DROPS
SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE ATLANTIC COAST THROUGH 12Z THURSDAY. THE
RESULTING NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL PUSH THE SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY INTO
THE FORECAST AREA GENERATING THE BEST CHANCE FOR CONVECTION DURING
THE EXTENDED PERIOD. HAD TO MAINTAIN SOME SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE
POPS BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH THE HIGHER POPS SOUTH DUE TO THE
FACT THAT THERE WILL BE NO SIGNIFICANT REDUCTION IN HIGH DEWPOINT
AIRMASS BEHIND THE FRONT. ALSO MODELS PROG A WEAK SHORTWAVE
DROPPING IN BEHIND THE MIDWEEK ACTION WHICH WILL WORK WITH THE
RELATIVELY MOIST LOW LEVEL AIRMASS GENERATING WEAK TO MODERATE
INSTABILITY ACROSS THE REGION. RAISED POPS TO LOW CHANCE CATEGORY
ON SATURDAY AS THE GFS AND ECMWF MAINTAIN THE TREND OF BRINGING
MORE SHORT WAVE ENERGY SOUTH ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND PART OF THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE CENTRAL
U.S. UPPER HIGH. THIS COULD MANIFEST ITSELF IN AN MCS OR TWO MOVING
ACROSS THE AREA. JUST KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY IN PLACE
FOR SUNDAY FOR ISOLATED CONVECTION. TRENDED RELATIVELY CLOSE IF NOT
A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW MAX TEMP GUIDANCE THROUGH WEDNESDAY WHILE
UNDERCUTTING SLIGHTLY MORE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. MIN
TEMP GUIDANCE LOOKED GOOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION MAY LINGER INTO THE EVENING HOURS ACROSS 
THE AREA...BUT MAINLY IN SOUTHERN LOCATIONS. A WEAK MID LEVEL RIDGE 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY WILL SHIFT SLIGHTLY 
EAST...ALLOWING FOR A MORE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. MODELS SHOW A 
WEAK TROUGH OVER THE AREA AT 850 MB IN THE AFTERNOON...WITH 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES A BIT HIGHER THAN TODAY. SO EXPECT THAT 
ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL AGAIN DEVELOP IN THE AFTERNOON. 1000-850 
THICKNESS VALUES INCREASE ABOUT 5-8 METERS TOMORROW IN THE SW 
FLOW...SO TEMPS SHOULD REACH INTO THE UPPER 90S SOUTH TO MID 90S IN 
MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY. WITH DEW POINTS IN THE LOWER 70S...THE HEAT 
INDEX WILL REACH BETWEEN 100 AND 105 IN MUCH OF THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN VALLEY FOR A FEW HOURS. WILL ISSUE A SPS TO ADDRESS THIS 
CONCERN. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
MAIN CONCERN FIRST 24 HOURS IS HOT TEMPERATURES. THICKNESS VALUES
STILL HIGH TUESDAY AND WITH DEW POINTS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE LOWER

BE OVER 100 ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA.
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL LIKELY REACH NEAR 105
AND POSSIBLY BETWEEN 105 AND 110 FOR A FEW HOURS IN THE AFTERNOON.
MAY NEED A HEAT ADVISORY FOR TUESDAY. OTHERWISE UPPER RIDGE
CENTERED OVER THE LOWER MS AND LOWER TN VALLEYS TUESDAY WILL WEAKEN
AND RETROGRADE WESTWARD TO THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES WEDNESDAY.
STRONG HEATING WILL PRODUCE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS
TUESDAY WITH SOME POSSIBLY STRONG PRODUCING GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY
RAIN. THEN WEDNESDAY WITH FLOW BECOMING NW DISTURBANCES IN THE FLOW
WILL BRING BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN SOME
STRONG TO POSSIBLY SEVERE AHEAD OF A WEAK COLD FRONT THAT WILL
DRIFT SOUTH FROM THE OHIO VALLEY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER
WEDNESDAY WITH THICKNESSES LOWERING AND MORE CLOUD COVER AND
PRECIPITATION. THIS FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PASS THROUGH WEDNESDAY
NIGHT OR THURSDAY WHICH WILL BE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN. FROM LATE
THURSDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND HIGHER PRESSURE OVER THE NE STATES
WILL BRING COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS INTO THE REGION. HOWEVER NW

THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN TODAY WILL BE HEAT INDEX VALUES IN THE
SOUTHERN VALLEY. HIGH TEMPS IN THE MID 90S WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE
LOWER 70S WILL MEAN THE HEAT INDEX WILL BE AROUND 100 DEGREES FOR A
FEW HOURS THIS AFTERNOON. WILL ISSUE A SPS TO ADDRESS THIS...AND
UPDATE THE ZFP TO ADD HEAT INDEX WORDING. FORECAST TEMPS LOOK TO BE
ON TRACK. A FAIRLY STABLE TEMPERATURE PROFILE IN THE 12Z OHX

SHOULD PREVENT MUCH CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON. ANY
SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP WILL LIKELY STAY ANCHORED TO THE HIGHER

TODAY.  WHILE MODELS INDICATE CAPES WILL BE UNIMPRESSIVE...THERE MAY 
BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION MAINLY SOUTH AND

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...GFS/ECMWF MODELS NOT TOO 
DISSIMILAR DURING THE PERIOD WHICH BEGINS WITH AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
OVER MUCH OF THE MID SOUTH AND SOUTHEASTERN U.S. SUBSIDENCE WITHIN 
THE INFLUENCE OF THE RIDGE SHOULD KEEP CONVECTION RATHER LIMITED 
WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN ACROSS THE SOUTH HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MOISTURE AND

TROUGH DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE SOUTHEASTERN CANADA INTO THE 
EASTERN GREAT LAKES. A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL ACCOMPANY 
INCREASING NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS 
AND OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT. KEPT HIGHEST CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR 
CONVECTION WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH BEST LIFT IN VICINITY 
OF GRADUALLY SOUTHWARD MOVING BOUNDARY. BY THURSDAY...COOL FRONT 
SHOULD BE SLIPPING SLOWLY SOUTH TOWARD NORTHERN GEORGIA SO USED A 
GRADATION OF LOWER TO HIGHER POPS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. MODELS 
INDICATE A SLOWER SOUTHWARD ADVANCE OF THE FRONT ACROSS MIDDLE 
TENNESSEE WITH BOUNDARY POSSIBLY STALLING JUST TO THE WEST SO HELD 
ONTO SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS ON FRIDAY. BY SATURDAY CONVECTION

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
SHOWERS POPPING UP IN THE TERRAIN OF WESTERN NC MAY SKIRT OUR 
SOUTHEASTERN COUNTIES...BUT OTHERWISE A DRY NIGHT IS EXPECTED ACROSS 
THE AREA. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY WILL SHIFT EAST 
TOWARD THE CHESAPEAKE THROUGH TOMORROW. THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
SOUTHEASTERLY 925-850 MB FLOW ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...WITH A DOWNSLOPE WIND IN THE TN VALLEY. EXPECT THAT 
THIS WILL HELP REDUCE THE CHANCES OF LOW CLOUDS DEVELOPING 
OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER DEW POINTS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S THIS 
AFTERNOON MAY RESULT IN SOME PATCHY FOG FORMATION. A MORE 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW DEVELOPS TOMORROW AS THE HIGH MOVES OFFSHORE. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS TOMORROW SHOW A WEAK CAP AND DRY AIR ALOFT THAT 
SHOULD SUPPRESS CONVECTION. SOME AFTERNOON SHOWERS MAY BE POSSIBLE 
OVER HIGHER TERRAIN..BUT SHOULD BE SHORT-LIVED AND ISOLATED. HIGHS 
WILL BE WARMER...REACHING THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S IN MOST SPOTS. 
THE HEAT INDEX COULD BRIEFLY TOUCH 100 IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
SUNDAY NIGHT ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SOUTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST NC AS UPSLOPE FLOW ON OTHER SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS 
CONTINUES WITH NO SHOWERS IN THE TN VALLEY. HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
ALOFT WITH SURFACE HIGH OVER MID ATLANTIC MONDAY CONTINUES HOT AND 
MOSTLY DRY FORECAST WITH CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU 
SEEING SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. TUESDAY THE PATTERN 
BEGINS TO CHANGE AS UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES MOVE SE INTO THE OHIO 
AND TN VALLEYS AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. CHANCE OF AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM TUESDAY THROUGH THE END OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. SATURDAY HIGH MAY STRENGTHEN ENOUGH THAT DRIER 
AIR MASS MAY KEEP SHOWERS FROM DEVELOPING BUT FOR NOW STILL HAVE 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. SHORT RANGE MODELS PUSH TEMPERATURES INTO 
THE UPPER 90S MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP HIGHS A COUPLE

CONTINUES WITH NO SHOWERS IN THE TN VALLEY. HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
ALOFT WITH SURFACE HIGH OVER MID ATLANTIC MONDAY CONTINUES HOT AND 
MOSTLY DRY FORECAST WITH CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU 
SEEING SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. TUESDAY THE PATTERN 
BEGINS TO CHANGE AS UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES MOVE SE INTO THE OHIO 
AND TN VALLEYS AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. CHANCE OF AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM TUESDAY THROUGH THE END OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. SATURDAY HIGH MAY STRENGTHEN ENOUGH THAT DRIER 
AIR MASS MAY KEEP SHOWERS FROM DEVELOPING BUT FOR NOW STILL HAVE 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. SHORT RANGE MODELS PUSH TEMPERATURES INTO 
THE UPPER 90S MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP HIGHS A COUPLE

INTO THE AREA OVERNIGHT BEHIND A MIDLEVEL TROUGH. AT THE
SURFACE...A TROUGH OR WEAK FRONT IS LOCATED TO OUR SOUTH...WITH AN

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WATER VAPOR CLEARLY SHOWS A
SHORT-WAVE MOVING EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH A GOOD
DEAL OF MID AND UPPER LEVEL DRIER AIR SPILLING INTO THE FORECAST AREA.
AT THE SURFACE...SLIGHTLY DRIER AND STABLE AIR IS MOVING INTO THE
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA..ESPECIALLY NORTHERN PLATEAU AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WHERE LOW CLOUDS AND FOG (SOME DENSE) IS
DEVELOPING AND SPREADING SOUTHWEST. THE DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR
WILL KEEP CHANCES OF CONVECTION CONFINED TO THE MOUNTAINS AND
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE A INVERTED TROUGH WILL HELP KEEP BETTER
INSTABILITY AND FOCUS FOR LIFT THIS AFTERNOON-EVENING HOURS.

ONCE THE MORNING CLOUDS MOVES EAST (LOWS CLOUDS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
AND PLATEAU DISSIPATE)...MOSTLY SUNNY TO PARTLY CLOUDY AFTERNOON IS
IN STORE FOR MOST LOCATIONS. THE RETURN OF SUNSHINE WILL ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO WARM UP.

FOR TONIGHT...PATCHY FOG WILL LIKELY DEVELOP AGAIN...ESPECIALLY
NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS GENERALLY 
AGREE ON A SCENARIO WHICH INCLUDES LINGERING MOISTURE/INSTABILITY 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA IN THE 
VICINITY OF A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY. BUILDING HEIGHTS ALOFT SHOULD 
LIMIT CONVECTION TO OROGRAPHICALLY FAVORED AREAS WITH ONLY SLIGHT 
CHANCE PROBABILITIES. THE PERIOD TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WILL 
BECOME A LITTLE MORE CONVECTIVELY ACTIVE AS UPPER TROUGH MIGRATES 
ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN STATES. ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY BUILDS 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY SO APPLIED MEDIUM CHANCE POPS AT 
THIS TIME REDUCING BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR ALL BUT THE SOUTHERN 
TIER COUNTIES OF THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY DUE TO EXPECTED 
GRADUAL SOUTHWARD BOUNDARY MOVEMENT. REDUCED POP TO SLIGHT CHANCE ON

MORNING. ALSO...A 60-70KT JET AT 300 MB IS MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY. THESE FEATURES ALONG WITH A WEAK WAVE MOVING ALONG A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO AND MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL FOCUS THE 
MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION
TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT.

PWS ARE JUST BELOW 2 INCHES WITH K INDICES IN THE MID-UPPER 30S...SO
PLENTY OF MOISTURE TO WORK WITH PRODUCING LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. 
LOCALIZED FLOODING PROBLEMS ARE ANTICIPATED...BUT NOT WIDESPREAD 
ENOUGH TO WARRANT A FLASH FLOOD WATCH.  BESIDES THE CONCERN OF HEAVY
RAINFALL...ENOUGH DAYTIME HEATING TO PRODUCE MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS THIS AFTERNOON-EVENING WITH STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE 
WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS.

CONVECTION WILL WEAKEN AND COVERGE WILL LESSEN OVERNIGHT DUE TO LOSS 
OF DAYTIME HEATING AND SHORT-WAVE MOVING EAST OF THE AREA.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS DUE TO BETTER
PERFORMANCE THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

IN THE SHORT-TERM...WILL INCLUDE PATCHY FOG FOR THIS MORNING.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...EASTERN STATES UPPER TROUGH 
MIGRATES SLOWLY EAST TO THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD BY 00Z SUNDAY WITH 
NORTHERLY FLOW PUSHING COOL FRONT TOWARD SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE BY 
EVENING. KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE CATEGORY GRADATION FOR

MAINTAINING THE HIGHER PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION ACROSS THE FAR 
EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS DURING THE AFTERNOON AS INSTABILITY AXIS 
DRIFTS FURTHER EAST. MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL DRY OUT AS 
HEIGHTS BUILD THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE WORK WEEK. HELD ONTO A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION IN THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH

ON MONDAY WITH RIDGE AXIS JUST TO THE WEST. NORTHEASTERN CORNER OF 
THE BIG RIDGE YIELDS TO THE GRADUALLY DEEPENING GREAT LAKES

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
THE BROAD MID LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE AREA TODAY WILL AMPLIFY 
TONIGHT...INCREASING SYNOPTIC LIFT AND PRECIP CHANCES TOMORROW.
SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS MAY LINGER THROUGH THE NIGHT...BUT MOST OF
THE ACTIVITY NOW SEEN ON RADAR WILL DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET. BY
FRIDAY AFTERNOON THE UPPER JET BECOMES POSITIONED OVER THE UPPER
OHIO RIVER AND CENTRAL APPALACHIAN REGION. THE NAM SHOWS A
FRONTOGENESIS ZONE IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET OVER SW VA.
THIS AREA OF ENHANCED LIFT ALONG WITH PW VALUES NEAR 2 INCHES COULD
PRODUCE PERIODS OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN NORTH TOMORROW EVENING. WILL
HAVE POPS RISING TO CATEGORICAL NORTH IN THE AFTERNOON...AND
WIDESPREAD RAIN AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF 1 INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE
THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING. A FLOOD WATCH WAS CONSIDERED...BUT WOULD
PREFER BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT IN PRECIP AMOUNTS AS THE NAM SHOWS
MUCH MORE QPF IN OUR COUNTIES THAN THE GFS. THE THREAT OF SEVERE
STORMS WILL DEPEND ON MORNING CLOUD COVER AND RESULTING
DESTABILIZATION...WHICH IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN...BUT SOUTHERN AREAS
WILL LIKELY HAVE THE GREATEST THREAT. PRECIP CHANCES SHOULD BEGIN
TO DECREASE TO A CHANCE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER JET SHIFTS
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
COLD FRONT EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST SOUTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA
SOMETIME SATURDAY WITH UPPER TROUGH MOVING TO THE EAST COAST AND
RIDGING BUILDING IN FROM THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND SOUTH CENTRAL
STATES. GFS FASTER THAN NAM MODEL WHICH KEEPS SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS AT LEAST THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA
THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY. WILL KEEP CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS MOUNTAINS AND EASTERN HALF OF SW VA AND NE TN. SUNDAY
AND MONDAY RIDGING MOVES OVER WITH HEATING PRODUCING ONLY ISOLATED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS. TUESDAY THROUGH
THURSDAY NW FLOW AROUND RIDGE WILL BRING WEATHER SYSTEMS CLOSE TO
THE FORECAST AREA AS ANOTHER FRONT DRIFTS SOUTH INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO THE LOWER TO MID 90S AFTER
TOMORROW AND CONTINUE THERE THROUGH THE EXTENDED.

NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS...SO A PERSISTENCE
FORECAST WILL BE FOLLOWED. A WEAK MIDLEVEL TROUGH SITS OVER THE
REGION...WITH ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINING IN PLACE. THE
12Z OHX SOUNDING LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...THOUGH THE 12Z
RNK SOUNDING SHOWS SOME DRIER AIR ALOFT HAS MOVED IN FROM THE
NORTH. THUS SOUTHERN AREAS MAY BE SLIGHTLY FAVORED FOR CONVECTION.
CONVECTIVE COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE SCATTERED THIS
AFTERNOON...WITH SLOW MOVING STORMS PRODUCING LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL. WITH LIGHT WINDS AND LACK OF SYNOPTIC
FORCING...CONVECTIVE INITIATION WILL BE IN HIGHER TERRAIN AND ALONG
OUTFLOW FROM DISSIPATED CONVECTION. THE FORECAST LOOKS REASONABLY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK TROUGH ENTERING THE AREA
TODAY BRINGING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE CWA.
HIGHEST CHANCES SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL THE AFTERNOON HOURS AS
INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE INCREASES. WILL CONTINUE THE 30 TO 50 PERCENT
POPS FOR TODAY. MAY SEE A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM
TODAY...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. ACTIVITY
SHOULD DECREASE DURING THE EVENING HOURS. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES
YESTERDAY WERE ON THE HIGH SIDE SO STAYED CLOSER TO MET/MAV BLEND
TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED
PERIOD...BUT SHOW SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE SMALLER- SCALE
DETAILS...ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. A WEAK
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE LINGERING NEAR THE FORECAST AREA ON
FRIDAY...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE
TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE
SHOULD COMBINE TO PRODUCE A GOOD COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ON FRIDAY
AND FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL LIKELY STILL BE
LINGERING AROUND THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...BUT MODEL
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT A CAPPING STABLE LAYER WILL BEGIN TO
DEVELOP DUE TO AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS
DRIFTING EASTWARD OVER THE MID SOUTH. THUS...WILL MENTION ONLY
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY...WITH CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY LIMITED
TO THE MOUNTAINS FOR SUNDAY. THIS UPPER-LEVEL HIGH WILL ALSO ALLOW
TEMPS TO RISE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THE WEEKEND AND INTO
EARLY NEXT WEEK...BUT ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO
APPROACH THE REGION ON TUESDAY AND BECOME STATIONARY NEAR THE
FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY. THIS WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD AGAIN
TRIGGER SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS NUMBERS IN
REGARDS TO MINS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT WILL TREND
SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN THE GFS MAXES SINCE THIS HAS BEEN THE
VERIFYING TREND LATELY (LIKELY DUE TO HIGHER THAN NORMAL BOUNDARY-

AND RNK SOUNDING NOW UP TO 1.5 INCHES. REACHING FORECASTED MAX TEMPS 
WILL BREAK THE SUBSIDENCE INVERSION (CAP). HOWEVER...WITH WEAK FRONT 
STILL TO OUR NW...WIND FIELDS REMAIN QUITE WEAK. THIS LACK OF LOW 
LEVEL COVERGENCE SHOULD KEEP COVERAGE OF TSRA ON THE ISOLATED SIDE. 
LACK OF WIND SHEAR SHOULD RESULT IN VERY WEAK CONVECTION THAT IS NOT 
VERY LONG LASTING OR STRONG. 

FORECAST GRIDS LOOK ON TRACK THIS MORNING AND THERE IS NOT MUCH NEED 
FOR AN UPDATE OF GRIDS AT THIS TIME. PROBABLY WILL UPDATE THE ZFPMRX 
PRODUCT TO REMOVE THE AFTERNOON WORDING...AND MAY ALSO WORD SRN 
VALLEY POPS AS JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE INSTEAD OF ISOLATED.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH SCATTERED 
CONVECTION OCCURRING ALONG IT. MODELS INDICATE MORE MOISTURE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY THAN IN PREVIOUS DAYS...WITH A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. 
THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN DUE TO THEIR CLOSER PROXIMITY TO THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THIS WEAK FRONT IS PROGGED TO BE LOCATED ACROSS 
EASTERN KY AND SOUTHERN WV BY THIS EVENING...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A 
MENTION OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TONIGHT AREAWIDE...BUT WITH CHANCE 
POPS OVER SOUTHWEST VA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WITH TEMPS A DEGREE 
OR TWO WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...ALTHOUGH HIGH CLOUDS FROM THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY MAY LIMIT THE AFTERNOON WARMING TODAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO GENERALLY 
AGREE ON BASIC UPPER LEVEL FLOW CONFIGURATION...BUT DIFFER ON 
DETAILS. INITIAL BOUNDARY PROJECTED TO APPROACH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION IN THE LATE MONDAY TO EARLY TUESDAY TIME FRAME. 
BOUNDARY STALLS JUST SOUTHEAST OF THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS. 
ANOTHER SURFACE BOUNDARY APPROACHES BY LATE WORK WEEK...BUT TIMING 
REMAINS SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN. HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE POPS THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY. BOUNDARY PROJECTED TO SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTH OF THE FORECAST

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SMALL CONVECTIVE CLUSTER HAS 
DROPPED SE INTO NE KY AND WESTERN PARTS OF W VA. CAP HAS WEAKENED 
BUT I DON'T ANTICIPATE ANY TSRA REACHING OUR NRN PLATEAU OR SW VA 
COUNTIES AT THIS TIME. BEST INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IS 
ACROSS THE TN-NC LINE...SO WILL CONTINUE THE SLIGHT CHANCE EVENING 
POPS FOR THAT AREA. OTHERWISE...GFS MOS MINS STILL LOOK SUSPICIOUSLY 
LOW...AND BASED ON TREND OF LATE...WILL OPT FOR LOWS CLOSER TO THE 
MILDER NAM MOS. SOME CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS WILL ALSO NEED TO BE 
FACTORED IN FOR AT LEAST SW VA AND NE TN EARLY TONIGHT.

LITTLE CHANGES MADE TO SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY...AS WEAK FRONT 
DROPPING INTO THE REGION WILL BE THE MAIN TRIGGER. CAN'T SEE THE 
BOUNDARY DROPPING SOUTH OF SE TN/SW NC THROUGH MONDAY...WITH BEST 
COVERAGE OF TSRA LIKELY BY MONDAY DAYTIME. AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND 
SLOWLY RISING POPS DON'T FAVOR THE HOTTER MAXES...BUT DO SUPPORT 
MILDER MINS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MEAN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
FINDS A HOME ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD 
WHICH WILL BRING SOME RAIN BACK TO THE FORECAST AREA ALONG WITH A 
SLIGHT REDUCTION IN MAX TEMPS. SHORT WAVE TROUGH BUILDS THROUGH THE 
AREA MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY PUSHING COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. TRENDED POPS BACK 
FROM CHANCE CATEGORY MONDAY NIGHT WITH A NORTH TO SOUTH GRADATION ON 
TUESDAY WITH HIGHER POPS NEAR STALLED BOUNDARY. BASICALLY WENT WITH 
DIURNAL CONVECTION ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES ON WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD THURSDAY KEEPING MUCH OF THE GREAT VALLEY 
DRY AS THE FORECAST AREA AWAITS THE NEXT SHORT WAVELENGTH TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THESE FEATURES BUILD INTO THE REGION 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AND STAYED WITH AN AREA WIDE CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION FOR THIS PERIOD. AGAIN KEPT MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA DRY 
ON SATURDAY BEHIND THIS COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY FAVORING HIGHER 
TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AND MUCH OF SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA FOR CONVECTIVE PRECIP. TRIED 
TO UNDERCUT MAX TEMPS A FEW DEGREES AND WHILE SLIGHTLY RAISING MIN 
TEMPS AS GUIDANCE DOES NOT SEEM TO HAVE A HANDLE ON THE UPPER TROUGH 
PATTERN WHICH HAS A DECENT CHANCE OF PRODUCING INCREASED CLOUD 
COVER...CONVECTION AND WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION.

EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WITH TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT 
UPPER RIDGE WILL AGAIN RETROGRADE WESTWARD AND WILL BE REPLACED BY 
BROAD LOW-AMPLITUDE TROUGH OVER MUCH OF THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE

FLOW ALOFT FOR THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. A SERIES OF WEAK

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...CONVECTION FROM MICHIGAN
TO NW IL AND IN WILL BE SPREADING CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS SOUTH
INTO OUR FORECAST AREA INTO THE EVENING HOURS. THESE CLOUDS WILL
REALLY BE THE ONLY CHANGE FROM THE PAST TWO NIGHTS. GFS MOS MINS
WERE A FEW DEGREES TOO COOL LAST NIGHT...SO PRESENCE OF SOME CLOUDS
TONIGHT FAVORS THE MILDER NAM MOS MINS OR A BLEND.

FOR LATER PERIODS...THE STEEP UPPER RIDGE WILL FLATTEN ON SATURDAY
AND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH WILL SAG SOUTHWARD...EASING
INTO NORTHERN PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY. NAM MODEL SEEMS
TO BE DOING A MUCH BETTER JOB OF HANDLING CONVECTION WITH THIS
SYSTEM. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS FOR SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WERE
MUCH IN LINE WITH NAM MODEL AND CONSISTENT WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS.
THUS...ONLY MINOR TWEAKS MADE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...TRIED TO KEEP THE
EXTENDED FORECAST SIMPLE. MODEL FORECASTS GENERALLY AGREE THAT AN
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES DURING
THE PERIOD. MORE SPECIFICALLY...IT APPEARS THAT TWO SHORTER
WAVELENGTH SYSTEMS WILL DROP INTO THE MEAN TROUGH DURING THE
PERIOD...EACH ASSOCIATED WITH A SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE FIRST
BUILDS IN MONDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AND TRIED TO SHOW A HIGHER
PROBABILITY OF PRECIP ACROSS THE NORTH HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA
DURING THE DAY FOLLOWED BY HIGHER POPS SOUTH HALF MONDAY NIGHT AS
FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM SHIFT STEADILY
SOUTH DURING THIS PERIOD. FOR TUESDAY USED LOWER POPS AND SHOWED
ANOTHER DECREASING PROBABILITY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AS THE BOUNDARY
SLOWS DOWN STALLING NEAR THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE BORDER IN NORTHERN
GEORGIA. KEPT POPS GENERALLY LIMITED TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN
WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD THURSDAY AWAITING ARRIVAL OF
SECOND SHORT WAVELENGTH SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE COOL FRONT
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. AGAIN DROPPED POPS ACROSS THE NORTH ON
FRIDAY TRENDING HIGHER PROBABILITY FARTHER SOUTH AS POSSIBLE
THUNDERSTORM OUTFLOW PRESSES FRONTAL BOUNDARY TOWARD EXTREME
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. CONCERNING TEMP

THESE CLOUDS COULD TAKE A DEGREE OR TWO OFF OF HIGHS IN SOME AREAS
...PLUS THE FACT THAT MOS HAS BEEN RUNNING ABOUT 1 TO 3 DEGREES TOO 
WARM FOR HIGHS THIS WEEK. ALSO...SMOKY MTN TEMPS JUST IN SHOW THAT

230 AM EDT FRI JUL 1 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WITH A DRY 
AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM OVER 
THE MID WEST SHOULD DISSIPATE THIS MORNING...AS IT MOVES SOUTHWARD 
INTO A DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR MASS OVER THE OHIO AND TN RIVER 
VALLEYS. NAM MODEL INDICATES THE POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL UPSTREAM 
MCS ACTIVITY OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION LATER TODAY...BUT THE MAIN 
EFFECTS TO THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD BE AN INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS. 
THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION PARTLY SUNNY SKIES AND WILL LOWER MAXES 
A DEGREE OR TWO IN MOST AREAS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM NUMBERS 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MAXES FOR TODAY BUT REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT. OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO RAISE 
TEMPS A FEW DEGREES FROM YESTERDAY'S MAXES AND MINS.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...REGION WILL REMAIN ON 
EASTERN PERIPHERY OF PERSISTENT UPPER RIDGE THROUGH THE EARLY 
PORTION OF THE LONG TERM. A WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION 
EARLY NEXT WEEK BUT ITS EFFECT IS UNCERTAIN SINCE MODELS DISAGREE ON 
THE MOISTURE PROFILE THAT ACCOMPANIES THE FRONT. MODEL DISAGREEMENT 
BECOMES EVEN GREATER THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE LONG TERM WITH THE 
ECMWF PROJECTING ANOTHER BOUNDARY APPROACHING BY NEXT THURSDAY. THE 
GFS KEEP THE BOUNDARY WELL NORTH HOWEVER. BASED ON THIS 
UNCERTAINTY...GENERALLY DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING 
GRIDS/FORECAST.

.AVIATION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WITH A DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A 
MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM NEAR CHICAGO WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE 
SOUTHWARD OVERNIGHT...BUT IT SHOULD WEAKEN AND DISSIPATE AS IT MOVES 
INTO A DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR MASS OVER THE OHIO AND TN RIVER 
VALLEYS. THE MAIN EFFECTS FROM THIS MCS...AND ADDITIONAL UPSTREAM 
MCS ACTIVITY LATER TODAY...WILL BE AN INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS OVER 
THE TAF SITES. THE DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE SHOULD ALSO PREVENT ANY FOG 
FORMATION THIS MORNING AT THE TAF SITES. OVERALL...VFR CONDITIONS

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER EASTERN KY WILL MEAN CALM WINDS AND
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT FOR MUCH OF THE AREA. A MCS OVER LAKE
MICHIGAN IS CREATING SOME CIRRUS THAT MAY MOVE ACROSS NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE AREA...BUT THESE CLOUDS SHOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT
ON TEMPERATURES.

SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FIRST PERIOD WERE MADE BASED ON THE
LATEST TEMPERATURE AND DEWPOINT TRENDS. TEMPS SHOULD STILL BOTTOM
OUT IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S NORTH...TO LOWER TO MID 60S SOUTH. ALSO
BROUGHT SOME CLOUD COVER LATE TONIGHT ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...CUMULUS CLOUDS EVEN MORE
LIMITED THIS AFTERNOON THAN YESTERDAY...WITH JUST A SCANT AMOUNT OF
CUMULUS OVER THE ERN MTNS INTO WRN NC. MAX TEMPS TODAY ARE BARELY
KEEPING UP WITH MOS/HOURLY GRIDS...SO FACTORED THIS INFO INTO HIGHS
FOR FRIDAY. THIS FAVORS A MOS BLEND WHERE SLIGHT DIFFS WERE NOTED.

SURFACE HIGH STAYS MAINLY TO OUR N OR NE THROUGH THESE PERIODS AND
KEEPS MOISTURE/CLOUDS VERY LIMITED. UPPER RIDGE GRADUALLY BUILDS
EASTWARD...SO EFFECT WILL BE DRY WEATHER WITH A DEGREE OR TWO
WARMER EACH DAY. BOUNDARY LAYER LOOKS TOO DRY TO CARRY ANY MENTION
OF FOG FOR NOW. 

LIGHT N-NE WIND FOR CENTRAL AND SRN VALLEY WILL FAVOR A MOS BLEND
FOR MINS TONIGHT...OVER THE COOLER GFS MOS TEMPS. A BLEND FOR MINS
AGAIN ON FRIDAY NIGHT. 
 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SOME MODEL 
UNCERTAINTY DEFINITELY AT PLAY DURING THE PERIOD BUT THE GENERAL 
TREND IS FOR A BIT MORE UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN. THE RIDGE IS 
PROGGED TO RETROGRADE BACK TO THE WEST ALLOWING FOR REPLACEMENT BY A 
MEAN UPPER TROF ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. 
PLACED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION ON THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR 
SUNDAY AND THEN TRIED TO INCREASE POPS TO LOW CHANCE CATEGORY BY 
MONDAY AS MODELS BRING A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA. PROGS TRY TO ADVANCE FRONT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA BUT AM SKEPTICAL ABOUT HOW FAST A BOUNDARY CAN MOVE 
THROUGH THE REGION. THEREFORE...GENERALLY STAYED WITH LOW CHANCE 
POPS FOR DAYTIME PERIODS WITH SLIGHT CHANCE AT NIGHT FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY IN THE AREA. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE 
TO GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BUILD
OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES TODAY WHILE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY CONTINUES TO BRING
DRIER AIR MASS INTO THE REGION WITH LIGHT NORTH TO NORTHEAST FLOW.
TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING ARE IN THE UPPER 50S TO UPPER 60S WITH
DEW POINTS IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S. THE COLD FRONT THAT PASSED
THROUGH ABOUT 24 HOURS AGO WAS ACROSS THE CAROLINAS AND EXTENDED
INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND WILL KEEP THE MORE HUMID AIR MASS SOUTH
OF THE REGION ONE MORE DAY. TODAY SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO WEDNESDAY
WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 80S TO NEAR 90 AND LOWER HUMIDITIES AS DEW
POINTS DROP INTO THE 50S DURING THE AFTERNOON. TONIGHT ANOTHER DROP
TO COMFORTABLE 50S TO LOWER 60S.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE AND RISING MID 
LEVEL HEIGHTS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SUNDAY. ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND. A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE IS 
PROGGED TO BEGIN TO TAKE SHAPE BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. WITH MORE 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY PRESENT...WILL CONTINUE WITH AT LEAST 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE AREA. A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAY DROP 
SOUTHEAST FROM KENTUCKY IN TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY...SO 
CHANCE OF CONVECTION INCHES UPWARD FOR THE FORECAST AREA NEXT WEEK. 
TEMPS COOL SOME NEXT WEEK WHILE REMAINING ABOVE NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...FEW CUMULUS CLOUDS HUGGING
THE TERRAIN AREAS WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES EXPECTED OVERNIGHT.
VALLEY AREAS MAY KEEP A VERY LIGHT NE WIND. THESE LIGHT WINDS AND
SOME DRYING OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER SHOULD INHIBIT FOG DEVELOPMENT
BUT MAY STILL SEE PATCHY FOG OVER SW VA/NE TN VALLEY AREAS...
AND CERTAINLY AT TRI. MOS MINS GENERALLY CLOSE AND FOLLOWED.

EVEN MORE SUNSHINE ON TAP FOR THURSDAY AND I LOOK FOR HIGHS TO
REACH AT LEAST TO SEASONAL NORMALS. 18Z TEMPS TODAY WERE RUNNING A
BIT BEHIND GRIDS...SO I TRENDED TOWARD MORE OF A BLEND FOR THURSDAY
HIGHS. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS REMAIN IN
CLOSE AGREEMENT IN BUILDING UPPER RIDGE AND RAISING MID LEVEL
HEIGHTS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SUNDAY. A WEAKNESS IN THE
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO TAKE SHAPE BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
WITH MORE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY PRESENT ALSO...WILL CONTINUE
WITH AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE WITH
HOT CONDITIONS WITH MID 90S EXPECTED ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST
AREA BY SUNDAY.

GFS/ECMWF MODELS DO INDICATE THAT A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAY DROP
SOUTHEAST FROM KENTUCKY IN TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY...SO
WILL STILL CONTINUE FOR NOW WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE
FORECAST AREA INTO TUESDAY...AS IT IS BECOMING APPARENT THAT THE
BOUNDARY WILL BECOME VERY DIFFUSE AND MEANDER ACROSS THE AREA.
EXPECT SAME SCENARIO FOR WEDNESDAY...AND HAVE INCLUDED SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS TO ACCOUNT FOR AT LEAST DIURNALLY DRIVEN WIDELY
SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA. TEMPS LOOK GENERALLY GOOD AS PER GFS NUMBERS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
DEPICTS SURFACE BOUNDARY STRETCHING NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST JUST 
SOUTHEAST OF THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SREF 
CONTINUE TO INSIST THAT BOUNDARY WILL PUSH WELL SOUTH OF THE AREA BY 
TOMORROW MORNING...USHERING IN SIGNIFICANTLY DRIER AIR MASS. HAVE 
CONTINUED TO GRADATE POPS FROM NORTH TO SOUTH EARLY TONIGHT TO 
ACCOUNT FOR EXPECTED TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA TOMORROW. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY 
FAVORED SLIGHTLY COOLER MAV GUIDANCE TONIGHT...AND A BLEND OF 
MET/MAV GUIDANCE TOMORROW.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BE THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE 
THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE WILL BE CENTERED 
OVER THE OZARKS THURSDAY...SHIFTING SLIGHTLY EASTWARD TO WEST TN 
FRIDAY. THE NAM SHOWS A WEAK TROUGH DROPPING SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA 
ON FRIDAY. WILL KEEP FRIDAY DRY HOWEVER AS THE GFS HAS THE RIDGE 
POSITIONED FARTHER EAST WITH THE TROUGH PASSING WELL EAST. TEMPS 
WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL EACH DAY UNDER THE RIDGE...BUT WILL UNDERCUT 
GFS MOS TEMPS WHICH ARE ON THE HIGH END OF THE ENSEMBLE MOS MEMBERS. 
ENSEMBLE MOS MEAN TEMPS WILL BE PREFERRED. 

06Z GFS AND 00Z ECMWF SHOW THE RIDGE WEAKENING ON SUNDAY...BUT THE 
12Z GFS SHOWS THE RIDGE HOLDING IN PLACE. WILL CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS 
FORECAST OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS. BETTER PRECIP CHANCES COME MONDAY 
AND TUESDAY AS THE RIDGE SHOULD LOSE ITS GRIP BY THEN. GFS ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT SHOWING PRECIP AND A BROAD GREAT 
LAKES TROUGH FOR THESE PERIODS...AND WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS GOING 
BOTH DAYS.

AREA IN WATCH IS SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND WESTWARD. GOOD INSTABILITY
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS MORNING. STORM MOTION WILL TAKE 
ONGOING CONVECTION INTO SOUTHEAST TN EARLY TODAY. MAIN THREAT IS 
DAMAGING WINDS. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL ALSO ACCOMPANY THESE STORMS. 

SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DEW POINT BOUNDARY BISECTS MRX CWA 
ACROSS NE TN. STRONG GRADIENT ACROSS BOUNDARY WITH LOW 60 DPS TO THE 
NE AND NEAR 70 OR HIGHER TO THE SW. UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST 
THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES TODAY. SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SE  INTO 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY TONIGHT. ONGOING CONVECTION WILL MOVE 
INTO THE AREA IN ADVANCE OF THE COLD FRONT TODAY. SOME STRONG TO 
SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE WITH DAMAGING WINDS THE MAIN THREAT. 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL SLOW OVER AREA AND TAPER OFF INTO THE AFTN. 
UNDERCUT MOS MAX TEMPS WHICH APPEAR TOO HIGH WITH ANTICIPATED CLOUDS 
AND SHOWERS. CLEARING TONIGHT WITH TEMPS FALLING TO NEAR NORMAL 
ESPECIALLY NW AREAS.   

LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIR 
AGREEMENT IN INITIALLY LOWERING MID LEVEL HEIGHTS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH NORTHWEST FLOW SETTING UP BEHIND COLD FRONT. MID 
TO UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION 
FROM THE WEST BY FRIDAY...RESULTING IN MORE CAPPING OF ATMOSPHERE 
AND WARMING TEMPS INTO THE 90S ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 

RIDGE WILL INITIALLY HOLD...BUT THERE ARE GOOD INDICATIONS THAT A
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL ATTEMPT TO MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE
AREA OUT OF KENTUCKY BY SUNDAY...AND WILL CONTINUE WITH AT LEAST
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO ACCOUNT FOR EXTRA INSTABILITY...MOISTURE AND
SLIGHTLY LESSENING CAP ACROSS THE AREA. BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE IN THEIR 
DEPICTION OF A UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD 
FRONT APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON TUESDAY. THERE 
ARE STILL SOME DISAGREEMENTS ON TIMING HOWEVER...WITH THE NAM 
SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN THE GFS. HAVE TENDED TO FAVOR THE NAM TIMING 
WHICH DEPICTS THE BEST POPS GENERALLY IN THE MORNING WITH THE PRECIP 
EXITING OUR CWA BY AFTERNOON. ALSO TENDED TO FAVOR COOLER MET 
GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR TOMORROW.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A COLD FRONT WILL BE PUSHING INTO OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES TUESDAY 
EVENING...AND SHOULD BE NEAR OUR SOUTHERN BORDER BY 12Z WED. 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EVENING SHOULD TAPER OFF 
AS THE FRONT MOVES SOUTHWARD. WEDNESDAY SHOULD BE A DRY AND 
COMFORTABLE DAY AS LOWER DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S FILTER INTO THE AREA. 
ALOFT...A STRONG RIDGE OVER THE PLAINS WILL BUILD EAST...AND KEEP 
THE REGION DRY THROUGH SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL TREND WARMER EACH 
DAY AS THE RIDGE ALOFT STRENGTHENS. 

ON SUNDAY THE UPPER RIDGE RETROGRADES SLIGHTLY...ALLOWING REMNANTS 
OF UPSTREAM CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS TO APPROACH OUR AREA IN THE NW FLOW. 
A PATTERN OF A PLAINS RIDGE AND AN EAST COAST TROUGH CONTINUES 
THROUGH MONDAY. THE FINER DETAILS OF MCS DEVELOPMENT ARE SKETCHY AT

251 PM EDT SUN JUN 26 2011

.SHORT TERM...(THIS EVENING THROUGH MONDAY)...A STATIONARY FRONT
REMAINS ACROSS THE WESTERN-MIDDLE TENNESSEE VALLEY...WHICH HAS BEEN
REINFORCED BY THE SERIES OF THUNDERSTORM COMPLEXS MOVING SOUTHEAST
ACROSS THE AREA. CURRENT CONVECTIVE COMPLEX WILL AFFECT AREAS
MAINLY WEST AND SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING.

MODELS SHOW ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASING OVERNIGHT NORTH AND EAST OF
THE BOUNDARY INTO THE FORECAST AREA WHICH MAY PRODUCE SCATTERED
CONVECTION TONIGHT...GENERALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY
MORNING. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THE POTENTIAL FOG DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT
WITH LOCALLY DENSE FOG POSSIBLE.

FOR MONDAY...WARM FRONT WILL PULL NORTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA.
AIRMASS WILL BECOME FAIRLY UNSTABLE (2000 J/KG+)...SO AFTERNOON AND
EVENING CONVECTION IS ANTICIPATED...ENHANCED BY LOCAL TERRAIN.
ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THAT A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION ON TUESDAY WITH CONVECTION ACCOMPANYING THE BOUNDARY. HAVE 
INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY IN THE NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA AS 
MODELS DEPICT BETTER MOISTURE PROFILE TO THE NORTH. HAVE CONTINUED 
WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS ELSEWHERE. MID TO LATE WORK WEEK STILL APPEARS 
GENERALLY DRY PER MODEL CONSENSUS. ANOTHER FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
APPROACHES SOMETIME NEXT WEEKEND...BUT MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
GENERALLY DISAGREE ON TIMING. HAVE SPREAD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER 
SEVERAL PERIODS TO ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING. HEIGHT RISES 
ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
SUGGEST TEMPS WILL CLIMB TO WELL ABOVE CLIMO BY WEEK'S END. 
GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS.

.AVIATION...VFR CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED THE REST OF 
TODAY...EXCEPT NEAR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED AT TYS AND 
CHA THROUGH 22Z.  INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER A WARM FRONT OVER 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL HELP PRODUCE A CHANCE OF STORMS ACROSS TYS 
AND CHA AFTER 05Z THROUGH 13Z.

MVFR-IFR CONDITIONS DUE TO FOG AND CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED AT TYS AND 
CHA AFTER 08Z THROUGH 13Z MONDAY. LIFR CONDITIONS POSSIBLE AT TRI 
BETWEEN 08-13Z. MAIN CAUSE IS DUE TO MOISTURE ADVECTION BACK INTO 
THE AREA OVER-RUNNING THE RAIN-COOLED BOUNDARY LAYER.

THE WARM FRONT WILL PULL NORTHEAST ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE MONDAY 
PRODUCING A CHANCE OF MAINLY AFTERNOON-EVENING CONVECTION AT ALL TAF

TAKING ON WARM FRONT CHARACTERISTICS. CONVECTIVE COMPLEX MOVING SE 
INTO W KY EARLY THIS MORNING. THE SE PROGRESSION OF THIS ACTIVITY 
REMAINS UNCERTAIN FOR TODAY. STEERING FLOW PROGGED TO SHIFT A BIT

WHILE BEING STEERED TO THE SE. SOME OF THESE STORMS WILL HAVE THE 
POTENTIAL TO BECOME SEVERE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. ACTIVITY SHOULD PERSIST UNTIL AROUND MIDNIGHT. SHORT WAVE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED QUASI- 
STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER CENTRAL EAST TN...WITH A HUMID AIR 
MASS SOUTH OF IT WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S. THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL LINGER OVER THE SAME GENERAL AREAS TONIGHT... 
WITH THE MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM 
(CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY) WILL MOVE 
SOUTHEAST ALONG IT LATER TONIGHT. IT APPEARS THAT THIS MCS WILL 
AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA AFTER SUNRISE ON SUNDAY...SO WILL PLAN TO 
REMOVE POPS FROM THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...EXPECT SOME 
FOG TO DEVELOP AGAIN LATE TONIGHT...BUT HIGH CLOUDS FROM THE 
UPSTREAM MCS SHOULD KEEP IT FROM BECOMING TOO WIDESPREAD. TEMPS FOR 
TONIGHT APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK OVERALL...BUT WILL PLAN TO TWEAK THEM 
A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

SITES IN TERMS OF PRECIPITATION. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A
THUNDERSTORM ARE TRYING TO DEVELOP IN THE VICINITY OF CHA AND TYS.
BELIEVE COVERAGE SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED EARLY IN THE TAF PERIOD

CONVECTION. APPLIED SOME LIGHT FOG AT CHA TOWARD DAYBREAK. TRI MAY
SEE SOME MVFR FOG AROUND 07Z DETERIORATE INTO IFR REDUCTION IN VSBY
BY 09Z. USED AN LIFR CEILING HERE AS WELL WHERE THE SURFACE AIRMASS
MAY BECOME SATURATED FOR A BRIEF PERIOD AROUND SUNRISE AND A LITTLE
BEYOND. MODELS CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A SHORT WAVE TROF WHICH MAKES
THE JOURNEY FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS BY 00Z MONDAY. INSTABILITY GRADIENT SHOULD BE IN PLACE
ALONG OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY FROM THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY SOUTHEAST
THROUGH THE LOWER TENNESSEE VALLEY ON SUNDAY AND POSSIBILITY EXISTS
FOR ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO MOVE INTO THE TAF SITES OF EASTERN

WAS LOCATED ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE TO NORTHERN ALABAMA. SCATTERED
CONVECTION CONTINUES TO DEVELOP ALONG AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY.
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALREADY ACROSS THE PLATEAU.
WILL MAINTAIN A CHANCE OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE WESTERN AND
SOUTHERN COUNTIES THIS EVENING.

PLENTY OF CLEAR SKY...LIGHT WINDS...AND MOIST GROUND WILL ALLOW
AREAS OF FOG TO DEVELOP AGAIN OVERNIGHT. LOCALIZED DENSE FOG IS
POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS.

FOR SUNDAY...QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARY WILL BE LOCATED ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY. A MCS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE CENTRAL
PLAINS THEN MOVE SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. OUTFLOW
FROM THIS MCS (LEFTOVER MCV) WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
SUNDAY PRODUCING A BETTER CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. SOME OF THESE
STORMS COULD BE SEVERE WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING WINDS
AND MARGINAL LARGE HAIL.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...STILL SOME 
INCONSISTENCIES NOTED AMONG MODELS MAINLY WITH THE TIMING OF A

GOOD AGREEMENT ON SE EXTENT OF CONVECTION TODAY AND PREFER FAVORABLE 
SREF AND CMC. WENT WITH MODEL BLEND ON MAX TEMPS TODAY AND PREFER 
COOLER GFS MIN TEMPS TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODEL CONSISTENCY POOR WITH GFS 
TRENDING DRIER FOR THE EXTENDED AND CONFIDENCE LOWERING.  BEST 
CHANCE OF CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO BE SUNDAY WITH A WEAK FRONT 
LIFTING INTO THE AREA AS A MINOR IMPULSE MOVES THROUGH.  THE 
BOUNDARY WILL LINGER OVER THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY...CONTINUE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  A 
WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF 
CONVECTION.  A FEW SHOWERS WILL LINGER INTO WEDNESDAY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS CONTINUE TO HAVE PROBLEMS 
DECIPHERING SHORT TERM FORECAST DETAILS. LINE OF CONVECTION THAT 
LOOKS RATHER OMNIPOTENT ON SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY APPEARS TO BE 
MISSING IN MODEL DEPICTION OF EXPECTED WEATHER. VERY MOIST AIR MASS 
WITH SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY WILL YIELD MORE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AGAIN TODAY. FAIRLY 
LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS ALREADY ONGOING OUT ON THE PLATEAU WITH AN 
AREA OF CONVECTION APPARENT BLOSSOMING THROUGH NORTHEAST ALABAMA AND 
NORTHERN GEORGIA HEADED TOWARD SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA. 

EXPECT THIS MASS TO BE SHIFTING EAST ACROSS EASTERN SECTIONS OF
THE FORECAST AREA EARLY IN THE PERIOD. THE LINE OF CONVECTION IS
REALLY MOVING QUICKLY TO THE EAST...ALMOST LOOKS LIKE A GOOD OLD
FASHIONED SPRING TIME FRONTAL PUSH. NICE STRONG WESTERLY FLOW
AROUND THE GREAT LAKES/MIDWEST UPPER TROF IS MOVING THIS FEATURE
ALONG AT A RAPID PACE. WHILE THE ACTUAL SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
MAY LAG BEHIND...BELIEVE THE CONVECTION MAY BE ABLE TO CREATE SOME
NICE OUTFLOW THAT STORMS CAN FIRE ON. SOME STORMS MAY BECOME SEVERE
AS THIS AREA BUILDS ONTO THE NORTHERN PLATEAU. THEREFORE...RAISED
POPS TO GOOD CHANCE AND EVEN LIKELY CATEGORY NORTHERN AND WESTERN
SECTIONS AND THEN WITH THE SURFACE BOUNDARY SLIDING CLOSER TO THE
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...APPLIED A LIKELY POP GENERALLY FOR AREAS
NORTH OF I-40. NO UPDATED MAV MOS BUT STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO
PREVIOUS MAX/MIN TEMPS FOR THIS ISSUANCE.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS STILL INDICATE
THAT FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD BE WELL SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA BY 12Z
FRIDAY. HAVE DECIDED TO LOWER POPS FOR FRIDAY MORE TOWARD THE
SLIGHT CATEGORY. MID-UPPER LEVEL RIDGING SHOULD PUSH INTO THE AREA
BY FRIDAY...WITH MORE PROGRESSIVE FLOW CONTINUING AND NEXT FRONTAL
BOUNDARY EXPECTED TO MOVE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY
AND INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION BY SUNDAY. CURRENT CHANCE POPS
LOOKS PRETTY GOOD FORECAST AREA WIDE FOR SUNDAY. CURRENT TRENDING
LOOKS GOOD AS FAR AS POPS ARE CONCERNED AS PER FORECAST SOUNDINGS
AND GFS MODEL THROUGH TUESDAY...AS MID-UPPER RIDGING AND SURFACE
HIGH PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA BY TUESDAY. 

IN LAST PORTION OF THE FORECAST PERIOD ON WEDNESDAY...ANOTHER COLD
FRONT IS EXPECTED TO DROP SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE AREA OUT OF THE OHIO
VALLEY REGION. FOR NOW...DUE TO UNCERTAINTY INVOLVING TIMING AND
STRENGTH OF SYSTEM...WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE
AREA.

.AVIATION...STRONG CONVECTION WILL LIKELY AFFECT CHA AND TYS FOR THE 
NEXT 3 TO 4 HOURS...THEN INTENSITY AND PERHAPS COVERAGE WILL 
DECREASE. SHOWERS WILL LINGER ACROSS TRI...BUT THE THREAT OF 
THUNDERSTORMS THERE SEEMS TOO LOW TO JUSTIFY MORE THAN VCTS FOR A 
FEW MORE HOURS. 

THESE TSRA WILL BRING BRIEF MVFR CONDITIONS TO TAF SITES...THEN WE 
MAY SEE A BROKEN LAYER AT 2500 FEET OR LOWER OVERNIGHT. SOME PATCHY 
FOG COULD ALSO FACTOR IN AS WELL...BUT NOT LIKELY TO BE DENSE.

FOR 23/12Z TO 24/00Z...MOISTURE DECREASES ON THURSDAY...ALTHO THERE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL INTERACT 
WITH MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR COMPLIMENTS OF THE PERSISTENT SOUTHERLY 
FLOW ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES LATER TODAY INTO TONIGHT. MODELS 
HAVE NOT BEEN PARTICULARLY HELPFUL THE PAST FEW DAYS BUT BELIEVE 
ORGANIZED CONVECTION WILL FORM ACROSS THE LOWER TENNESSEE VALLEY AND 
SHIFT EAST NORTHEAST OVER THE FORECAST AREA INTO THE EVENING HOURS 
SO LOWER POPS A TAD TODAY AND RAISED A BIT FOR TONIGHT. WENT CLOSER 
TO WARMER MAV MOS TODAY AND MILDER MET MOST TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS INITIALLY ARE
DIFFERING SOMEWHAT INVOLVING PRECIP CHANCES FOR THURSDAY. WILL
INITIALLY GO CLOSER TO THE NAM SOLUTION IN RELATION TO POPS FOR
THURSDAY..AS MODELS STILL SHOW SHORTWAVE MOVING SOUTHEAST INTO THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY THROUGH UPPER TROUGH TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST
AREA. GFS MODEL IS DRIER FOR THE AREA FOR THURSDAY...COMPARED TO
THE NAM. 

WEAKNESS IN UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO ALLOW FOR WEAK IMPULSES IN
MID-UPPER FLOW TO MOVE EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WILL CONTINUE
WITH CHANCE POPS FOR THE AREA THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON. NEXT
FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED BY THE MODELS TO MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO
THE FORECAST AREA OUT OF KENTUCKY BY 00Z MONDAY...WITH CONTINUED AT
LEAST CHANCE POPS FOR THE AREA INTO MONDAY. GFS/ECMWF BOTH ARE
SIMILAR IN SLOWLY PUSHING COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA BY LATE
MONDAY...WITH RIDGING MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION BY
TUESDAY. CURRENT FORECAST ACCOUNTS FOR JUST DIURNAL AFTERNOON
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY...WHICH LOOKS GOOD. TEMPS ARE IN
LINE WITH GOING FORECAST...AND WILL NOT BE MAKING MUCH IN THE WAY
OF CHANGES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE DAMPENING DOWN AS 
A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA.  SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE 
TN WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE MRX CWA THIS EVENING.  ADDITIONAL 
WIDESPREAD CONVECTION IS EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES 
IN.  WITH GOOD LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND AN UNSTABLE AIR MASS IN PLACE 
...THERE WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR A FEW OF THESE STORMS BECOME 
STRONG...POSSIBLY SEVERE.  ALSO...WITH ABUNDANT RECENT RAINFALL 
...ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAINS COULD CAUSE LOCALIZED FLOODING.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...GREAT LAKES UPPER LOW 
WILL EXTEND A TROUGH AXIS SOUTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA INTO 
SATURDAY. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL LINGER IN THE VICINITY AS 
WELL...WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO A PROLONGED PERIOD OF AT LEAST SCATTERED 
ORGANIZED CONVECTION. TWEAKED A FEW POP AND WEATHER GRIDS FOR THESE 
PERIODS...BUT PREVIOUS GRIDS WERE GENERALLY ON TRACK.

UPPER LEVEL FLOW IS SOMEWHAT DIFFLUENT OR WEAK TROUGH LINGERING ON 
SUNDAY...SO I HAD TO FILL IN ANY DRY PERIODS WITH SLIGHT CHANCE TO 
CHANCE POPS OUT THROUGH MONDAY. WILL INTRODUCE NEW DAY 7 (TUESDAY) 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCE DAYTIME POPS FOR NOW. 

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...TRENDED TOWARD THE GFSX MOS THROUGH THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...A FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS SLOWLY 
WORKING ITS WAY TO OUR NORTH...ENDING CONVECTION OVER THE MRX CWA.  
MAY SEE A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP AND MOVE 
THROUGH DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON...BUT LOOKING DRY FOR 
THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.  ON 
TUESDAY...OUT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT...A FEW  
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AND MOVE EAST TOWARDS OUR AREA.  COVERAGE 
SHOULD BE QUITE LIMITED AND MAINLY STAY TO OUR WEST BUT WILL HAVE 
SOME 20 POPS OVER WESTERN AREAS OT COVER.

.LONG TERM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...BUILDING UPPER RIDGE AND 
SURFACE BOUNDARY MOVING NE OF THE REGION WILL WORK TO LOWER POPS 
INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...INCREASING SW FLOW ALOFT AHEAD OF NEXT 
COLD FRONT WILL LEAD TO HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS FOR WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 

UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING INTO THE WEEKEND WITH EITHER A STALLED FRONT 
OR WARM FRONT IN OUR VICINITY...KEEPS AT LEAST ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION IN THE FORECAST. I DID KEEP SAT NIGHT AND SUN NIGHT DRY 
WITH 14 PERCENT POPS FOR NOW...SOMETHING THAT CAN BE CHANGED AS 
NEEDED. 

MODELS DIVERGE BY MONDAY (NEW DAY 7)...SO I OPTED FOR JUST SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS DAYTIME AND DRY MONDAY NIGHT FOR NOW. MOS POPS FOR 
MONDAY ARE NEAR OR BELOW CLIMO. FOR TEMPS...LOOKS TO BE A PERIOD 
WITH NEAR SEASONAL HIGHS AND A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR LOWS.

A PERSISTENT NW FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO BRING MID-UPPER LEVEL IMPULSES 
ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA TODAY. CONVECTION HAS BEEN 
BLOSSOMING OVER KY AND WILL TRACK ACROSS NE SECTIONS THIS MORNING.  
WILL RAISE POPS THERE TO LIKELY. A LOW-TO-MIDLEVEL RIDGE ACROSS 
GA/AL WILL GRADUALLY LIFT NORTHWARD TODAY...WHICH WILL SUPPRESS 
CONVECTION ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN SECTIONS THIS AFTERNOON. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS SHOW CHA REMAINING CAPPED WHILE STORMS IN THE TYS AND TRI 
AREAS SHOULD BE ABLE TO TAP INTO CAPE VALUES BETWEEN 3000-4000 
J/KG...SO SOME SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. HEAVY RAIN WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE STORMS...BUT WILL LET THE FLOOD WATCH EXPIRE AS 
WIDESPREAD PROBLEMS ARE NOT EXPECTED. WITH THE BUILDING RIDGE 
THROUGH THE DAY...CONVECTION SHOULD DIMINISH IN THE EVENING AND EXIT 
THE AREA BY MIDNIGHT. DO NOT EXPECT OVERNIGHT CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT 
AS WE HAVE SEEN THE PAST FEW NIGHTS DUE TO THE RIDGE. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN 
BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY. A FRONT MOVES INTO THE REGION ON 
WEDNESDAY AND LINGERS INTO FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS 
WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT  ANOTHER

LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 850-500 MB THICKNESS VALUES...CORFIDI 
VECTORS...AND THE CURRENT INSTABILITY AXIS INDICATE THAT THIS MCS

AGREEMENT WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR ANOTHER MCS FROM THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY EVENTUALLY AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
THIS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT PATTERN WILL CONTINUE TO BE CONDUCIVE FOR

IT COULD OCCUR ALMOST ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT WITH A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IN CLOSE PROXIMITY AND THE MOVEMENT OF MCS'S TOWARDS THE 
REGION. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE

PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT WITH TEMPS A LITTLE 
WARMER DUE TO THE PASSAGE OF A WARM FRONT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AND DIFFUSE COLD FRONT ALONG THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...WITH A DRIER AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA COMPARED 
TO YESTERDAY. MODELS AGREE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW WILL 
LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...WHICH COULD 
RESULT IN AN ACTIVE PATTERN WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF MCS'S FROM THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS AND MID MS RIVER VALLEY AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA. 
THE BEST CHANCES FOR CONVECTION APPEARS TO BE OVER NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA...WHICH WILL CLOSER TO A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY PROGGED TO BE SITUATED OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. BECAUSE OF THE PROXIMITY OF THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY...WILL NOT MENTION ANY DIURNAL TIMING WITH THE CONVECTION 
SINCE IT COULD OCCUR ALMOST ANY TIME OF DAY OR NIGHT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH 
HIGHS THROUGH SATURDAY (MAIN DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN THE EXPECTED 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION). WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE TWO...BUT WILL LEAN MORE TOWARDS THE WARMER GFS NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...DISTURBANCE SLIDING THROUGH 
NORTHWEST FLOW ON SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT. BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT 
EXPECTED OVER NORTHERN AREAS AND HAVE KEPT HIGHER POP OVER NORTHERN 
THIRD. UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN FOR DRY CONDITION MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  
MOVING INTO AN UNSETTLE WEATHER PATTERN WITH MODELS BRINGING IN A 
COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION LATE WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. CONFIDENCE 
LOW ON DETAILS AND FOR NOW WILL KEEP POPS AT 20 TO 30. AS FOR

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SUGGESTS THAT A WEAK AND DIFFUSE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WAS LOCATED OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND WESTERN TN RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH A SLIGHTLY DRIER AND COOLER AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA DUE TO OUTFLOW FROM YESTERDAY'S CONVECTION. MODELS AGREE THAT 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL ADVECT A DRIER AIR MASS INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT...RESULTING IN AN ABSENCE OF CONVECTION. 
VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME LINGERING CLOUDS OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH AREAS OF FOG 
STILL LINGERING IN THE SEQUATCHIE VALLEY AND ALONG SOME OF THE 
WATERWAYS. THESE CLOUDS AND FOG SHOULD DIMINISH WITH THE DAYTIME 
HEATING...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY FORECAST 
FOR TODAY.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE THIS MORNING TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST 
TRENDS.

MOST OF THE AREA EARLY THIS MORNING HAD A STRATOCUMULUS DECK AROUND
3000 - 4000 FT MSL. THE BACK SIDE OF THIS AREA IS VERY
TRACK-ABLE...THE REASON FOR THE WX GROUP TIME OF 1320Z AT KTYS...TO
CLEAR OUT THIS LAYER.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STORMS HAVE ALL DISSIPATED AND 
CLOUD TOPS ARE WARMING.  NAM TRIES TO DEVELOP SOME SHOWERS BETWEEN 
08Z AND 12Z...BUT BY 12Z THEY EXIT PRETTY QUICKLY...SO WILL KEEP 
THIS FIRST PERIOD DRY.  FOR TONIGHT...MOISTURE RETURNS IN NW 
FLOW...BUT DOES NOT SEEM ORGANIZED...WILL ALSO HAVE TONIGHT 
DRY...BUT WILL INCREASE CLOUDS OVERNIGHT.  FOR TEMPS...HAVE NOT 
VEERED TOO MUCH FROM GUIDANCE...BUT HAVE TWEAKED TIMING OF HOURLY 
TEMPERATURE GRIDS TO ALLOW SLOWER WARM-UP DURING THE DAY TODAY...AND 
MORE RAPID COOL-DOWN IN THE EVENING...THEN SLOWER COOL-DOWN AFTER
MIDNIGHT AS CLOUDS ROLL IN. WEAK COLD FRONT EXPECTED TO WASH
THROUGH AS WINDS VEER IN GENERAL TODAY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SEE A CONSISTENT TREND IN 
MODELS WITH MAINLY CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN ORDER THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. UPPER RIDGE AXIS STAYS OUT WEST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES 
AND THE W-NW FLOW ALOFT PERSISTS OVER THE TN VALLEY AND SRN 
APPALACHIANS. THIS PATTERN WILL KEEP THE POSSIBILITY OF TSRA FOR NOT 
JUST THE TYPICALLY FAVORED DIURNAL PERIODS. HOWEVER...IT SEEMS SAFE 
TO RUN LOWER OR EVENTUALLY NO POPS ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC AREAS. 

CANADIAN...ECMWF AND GFS SEEM IN FAIR AGREEMENT ON UPPER RIDGE 
SHIFTING EAST BY MONDAY...SO I WOULD PREFER TO KEEP MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY DRY FOR NOW. THIS IS A BIT AT ODDS WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS 
SO I NUDGED POPS UP TO 14 PERCENT TO BE CLOSE ON TOLERANCE FOR 
DIFFERENCES. UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT APPROACHING BY WEDNESDAY... 
SO I KEPT PREVIOUS SLIGHT CHANCE AND CHANCE POPS FOR BOTH WEDNESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 

FOR TEMPS...NO MAJOR STRAYING FROM GUIDANCE ON EITHER LOWS OR 
HIGHS...JUST A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO MESH BETTER WITH 16/00Z GFSX MOS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...ACTIVE STORMS THIS 
AFTERNOON...BUT NOT AN ACTIVE PATTERN OF SYSTEMS AS FRONTAL SYSTEM 
LOOKS TO NOT CLEAR THE AREA UNTIL LATER ON THURSDAY.  WILL CLEAR THE 
PRECIP WEST TO EAST ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT FRONT 
NOT MAKING IT FAR AWAY AT ALL.  

SEVERE THREAT FOR THE AREA LIKELY TO GO INTO THE NIGHT AS 25KT 
LOW-LEVEL JET PUMPS MOISTURE INTO THE AREA.  PRESENT SVR WATCH GOES 
UNTIL 8PM...BUT WOULD THINK SOME PART OF THE AREA WILL HAVE A WATCH 
AFTERWARDS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THIS PERIOD STARTS 
OUT WITH A FAIRLY MUTED WAVE PATTERN WITH THE UPPER LOW STILL OVER 
THE GRT LAKES AND THE UPPER HI OVER NRN MEXICO.  BY SATURDAY THE 
HIGH DRIFTS OVER TEXAS AND BUILDS RESULTING IN 500MB HEIGHT RISES 
OVER OUR CWA OF ABOUT 50-60M...AND PUSHES THE NW FLOW MAIN STORM 
TRACK OFF TO OUR NORTHEAST.

BEFORE THE RIDGE BUILDS IN...MODELS SHOW SMALL WIGGLES IN NW FLOW 
OVER AREA FOR FRIDAY...SUFFICIENT TO KEEP SOME POPS IN...THEN TREND 
TO NO POPS SW-NE OVER A 2-DAY PERIOD...STARTING IN THE SW FRIDAY 
NIGHT NEAR CHA...AND FINALLY CUTTING OFF POPS IN THE NORTHEAST BY

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY GENERALLY ALONG A PADUCAH KY TO HUNTSVILLE AL TO 
MACON GA LINE. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE 
NORTHWARD TODAY AS A WARM FRONT...AS 850 MB SOUTHERLY WINDS INCREASE 
AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID WEST. AS A RESULT... 
DEWPOINTS SHOULD SLOWLY RISE TODAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WITH 
BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS INDICATING A MODERATELY TO POTENTIALLY 
VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING BY LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY 
EVENING. WITH A DECENT MID-LEVEL WIND FLOW DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THIS 
WARM FRONT BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND ALSO AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT BY 
LATER THIS EVENING...IT APPEARS THAT THERE SHOULD BE A GOOD COVERAGE 
OF CONVECTION DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SOME SEVERE TSTORMS. THE MAIN THREATS APPEAR TO BE DAMAGING WINDS 
AND LARGE HAIL...BUT THE INCREASING WIND FLOW BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING COULD ENCOURAGE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW SUPERCELLS WITH 
THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ISOLATED TORNADO OR TWO.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO RAISE 
POPS A LITTLE FOR THIS AFTERNOON...AND TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME SEVERE STORMS. WILL ALSO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE

SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL PASS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING TRIGGERING POTENTIAL FOR SCATTERED 
TO WIDESPREAD CONVECTION FOR MOST OF THE CWA. HAVE BUMPED UP POPS TO

ONLY MODEST INSTABILITY BY LATE AFTERNOON...BUT SOME STRONG TO 
SEVERE STORMS PROBABLY CANNOT BE RULED OUT GIVEN EXPECTED TIMING. 
TEMPS FOR TODAY A LITTLE PROBLEMATIC AS CLOUDS AND EXACT PRECIP 
ONSET SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN. TENDED TO FAVOR BLEND OF MET AND MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR TODAY.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MINOR CHANGES MADE TO 
EARLIEST PERIODS AS ALL MODELS SUGGEST CONVECTION WILL BE MAINLY 
AROUND THURSDAY MORNING...THEN EXITING TO OUR SE. IF FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY DOES SLIP EAST AND SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS... 
THEN LOWER POPS (OR NONE) WOULD BE IN ORDER FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 
FOR NOW...WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT FOR 
CONTINUITY.

FOR LATER PERIODS...ECMWF AND OTHER MODELS DON'T BUILD THE UPPER 
RIDGE AND KEEP A WEAK W-NW FLOW ALOFT...WHICH WOULD ALLOW ANY 
DEVELOPING CONVECTION TO TRACK ESE ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA. THUS
REALLY NOT ABLE TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT IMPROVEMENTS TO PREVIOUS 
GRIDS FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. DID TWEAK A FEW MAX/MIN GRIDS 
DURING THOSE PERIODS...TO BE IN LINE WITH 15/00Z GFSX MOS AND ALSO 
NEIGHBORS GRIDS.

BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...BOTH ECMWF AND GFS BUILD THE UPPER RIDGE FROM 
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY NORTH TO THE WRN GREAT LAKES. LOW LEVEL 
SOUTHERLY FLOW STAYS MOSTLY TO OUR WEST. THIS ALL SUPPORTS CURRENT 
VERY LOW POPS (20 PERCENT OR LESS) FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT.

AN EARLY UPDATE WILL BE ISSUED TO REMOVE POPS FROM THE OVERNIGHT
PERIOD. RADAR TRENDS HAVE SHOWN UPSTREAM SHOWERS DECREASING AS THEY
MOVE SOUTHEAST...AND IF ANY SHOWERS ARE MAINTAINED...THEY SHOULD
STAY TO OUR WEST NEAR THE SURFACE FRONT. RUC FORECAST SOUNDINGS
TONIGHT ARE QUITE DRY AND STABLE. A MID-UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING
OVER THE AREA TONIGHT SHOULD FURTHER DECREASE RAIN CHANCES TONIGHT.

VFR CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST THROUGH THE PERIOD. ONLY HIGH CLOUDS
FROM DISSIPATED CONVECTION ARE EXPECTED. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND
VARIABLE TONIGHT AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDS SOUTHWARD FROM
THE GREAT LAKES. A FRONT LOCATED ACROSS MIDDLE TN WILL MOVE
NORTHEAST AND BRING MORE UNSTABLE AIR AND A SOUTH WIND

.DISCUSSION...RADAR ACTIVITY TO THE WEST OF THE CWA...BUT MAY STILL 
INCREASE IN OUR AREA AS A FRONTAL BOUNDARY NEARS. WILL LEAVE THE 
CURRENT POPS AS IS WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN OUR WESTERN COUNTIES. 
CURRENT TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. WILL 
UPDATE FORECAST TO REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING...NO OTHER CHANGES 
PLANNED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING WITH LITTLE CHANCE OF ANY FOG DEVELOPING
BEFORE DAYBREAK...GIVEN LIGHT N-NE SURFACE WINDS AND DEW POINT
TEMPS MOSTLY IN THE 50S. 

SOMEWHAT SKEPTICAL THAT MUCH CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON
OR EVENING...EXCEPT TO OUR WEST. KEPT PREVIOUS LOW POP GRIDS FOR
CONTINUITY...WITH WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY NEARBY AND NW FLOW ALOFT.
HOWEVER...I DID LOWER POPS JUST SLIGHTLY FOR TONIGHT FOR ALL BUT
OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES.

OTHERWISE...DRY AIR WOULD SEEM TO FAVOR A BLEND OF MOS FOR HIGHS OR
CLOSER TO THE WARMER GFS. MINS TONIGHT ACCEPTABLE...BUT COOLER MINS
ARE A BETTER CHOICE IF CONVECTION AND ASSOCIATED CLOUDS ARE NOT
THAT SIGNIFICANT TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THAT SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL PASS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION IN THE LATE WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME TRIGGERING 
POTENTIAL FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION FOR MOST OF THE CWA. UPPER FLOW 
BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY AGAIN BY LATE WORK WEEK. AT THIS POINT... 
MEDIUM RANGE MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE AS THE ECMWF MAINTAINS 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WITH PERIODIC MCS ACTIVITY TRANSLATING THROUGH 
THE FLOW. HOWEVER...THE GFS DEPICTS A GRADUAL RETURN TO DOMINANT 
UPPER RIDGE OVER MUCH OF THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS BY LATE WEEKEND 
WITH A CORRESPONDING RETURN TO WELL-ABOVE-CLIMO TEMPS. TENDED TO 
FAVOR GFS ALTHOUGH THERE ARE SEVERAL GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS WHICH 
SUPPORT THE ECMWF SOLUTION...RESULTING IN LOW-CONFIDENCE FORECAST 
FOR LATE IN THE LONG TERM.

328 PM EDT MON JUN 13 2011

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE SHOULD
KEEP THE PRECIPITATION TO THE WEST TONIGHT. IT SHOULD ALSO LIMIT
FOG FORMATION FOR TONIGHT. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO TRACK
INTO THE AREA BRINGING A CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS ON TUESDAY. WITH
ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE AVAILABLE WILL CONTINUE WITH THE SLIGHT POPS
FOR TUESDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE WESTERN PORTIONS
OF THE CWA NEARER THE BOUNDARY. WITH INCREASING INSTABILITY...COULD
SEE A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES
EXPECTED TODAY AND TONIGHT...STAYED NEAR THE MAV/MET BLEND GUIDANCE
FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AT THE START OF THIS 
PERIOD...AN UPPER RIDGE IS ANCHORED FROM THE THE SOUTH-CENTRAL US 
ACROSS NORTHERN MEXICO...WITH TROUGHINESS OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND 
NEW ENGLAND...RESULTING IN A CLASSIC/BUSY NORTHWEST FLOW OVER THE TN 
VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS. MOST OF THIS SIX DAY PERIOD IS SIMPLY 
OSCILLATIONS ON THIS THEME.  HOWEVER...TOWARD THE END OF THE 
PERIOD...THERE IS A DEFINITE TREND OF THE RIDGE SWELLING INTO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN US...THAT PUSHES THE HEART OF THE NW FLOW MORE OVER THE 
MID-ATLANTIC INTO NEW ENGLAND.

ON THE FRONT END...IT LOOKS LIKE THE APPROACHING WARM FRONT TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...WILL SET THE STAGE FOR AN MCS TO ROLL OVER 
THE AREA LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND INTO THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY.  LATEST 
MODEL RUNS AND HPC DISCUSSIONS HINT ON A SLIGHTLY MORE NORTHERLY 
SCENARIO FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK...AFTER THIS INITIAL MCS ON 
WED...MEANING THAT WE WOULD EITHER ONLY GET GLANCING BLOWS OR BE OUT 
OF THE MAIN PIPELINE AND JUST GET BASIC SUMMER-TYPE BUILD-UPS.  AT 
ANY RATE...AFTER WED AM DROPPING THE POPS TO 20S AND 30S PERCENTS.

FOR TEMPS...WENT FOR A MUTED DIURNAL RANGE ON WEDNESDAY WITH 
ADVANCING CLOUDS KEEPING WED DAYBREAK WARMER...BUT RAIN AND CLOUDS 
KEEPING THE AFTERNOON COOLER.  DIDN'T GO TOO FAR FROM GUIDANCE 
AFTERWARDS...SELECTIVELY BUMPING UP MAX TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO SINCE 
STORM TRACK WILL BE FARTHER NORTH.  BEST CHANCES FOR SEVERE STORMS 
LOOK TO BE EITHER FROM LEFTOVERS OF MCS TUESDAY NIGHT...OR FROM 
REDEVELOPMENT ON WEDNESDAY.  RIGHT NOW...MAIN THREAT FOR ORGANIZED 
SEVERE STORMS LOOKS NORTH OF THE AREA LATER IN THE FORECAST.

.AVIATION...FOG THICKENED OVERNIGHT AT TRI BUT SHOULD BEGIN TO LIFT 
AND DISSIPATE SHORTLY...WITH LIFR CONDITIONS FOR ABOUT ANOTHER HOUR 
OR SO THERE.

MINIMAL FOG DEVELOPED AT TYS ONCE THE LIGHT NORTH WINDS DIMINISED
BUT EXPECTING MAINLY JUST BRIEF MVFR. CHA LIKELY TO REMAIN VFR 
THROUGH THIS TAF PACKAGE.

OTHERWISE...NOT EXPECTING ANY CONVECTION TODAY WITH SOME LIGHT FOG 
POSSIBLE AGAIN LATE TONIGHT AT TRI.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FIRST CONCERN IS AREAS OF 
LOCALLY DENSE FOG (OR A STRATUS DECK) THIS MORNING IN AREAS THAT 
MEASURED SOME RAINFALL ON SUNDAY. LIGHT NORTH WINDS NOTED AT SEVERAL 
SPOTS WITH A CORRESPONDING DROP IN DEW POINT TEMPS. WILL KEEP FOG 
MENTION MAINLY TO THE PRE 12Z FORECAST GRIDS AND JUST COVER ANY 
DENSE FOG SPOTS IN THE SHORT TERM FORECAST.

SECOND CONCERN IS HOW SAFE IT IS TO KEEP FORECAST DRY LATER TODAY.
APPEARS THAT DEW POINT TEMPS WILL HAVE MIXED DOWN INTO THE 50S BY OR 
WELL BEFORE PEAK HEATING...SO OPTED TO KEEP A DRY FORECAST FOR TODAY.
I DID NUDGE POPS UP TO 14 PERCENT NEAR ADJACENT GRIDS FROM FFC/HUN 
AND GSP. SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER FOR HIGHS...BUT THE DRY AIR 
AND GROUND SHOULD ALLOW LOWER 90S IN SOME LOCATIONS (SUCH AS CHA). 

NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT FOR TONIGHT...BUT APPEARS THAT ANY CONVECTION 
WILL BE WEST OF THE TN VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS. THUS...DRY FOR 
ANOTHER PERIOD WITH LITTLE TO NO CHANGES MADE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS.
MOS TEMPS FOR BOTH TODAY AND TONIGHT LOOKED CLOSE AND REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW WILL SETTLE
ACROSS FORECAST AREA THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. UPPER TROUGH OVER NE
STATES WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST BUT OTHER UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS WILL
DROP SE FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE TN VALLEY. WEAK SHORT
WAVE ACTIVITY MOVING SE WILL CAUSE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA BY
AFTERNOON TUESDAY. MCS MAY FORM OVER MS VALLEY AND THEN MOVE EAST
INTO TN VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT EAST OF A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY
CONNECTED TO A LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. SW LOW
LEVEL JET WILL INCREASE EAST OF THE BOUNDARY AND HELP ENHANCE 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WHICH MAY BRING LARGE HAIL OR DAMAGING
WINDS WITH STORMS THAT DEVELOP TUESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY CLOSED
UPPER LOW EXPECTED TO FORM ACROSS WESTERN GREAT LAKES WITH SURFACE
LOW OVER NE MO. A WARM FRONT MOVING EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
FROM THAT LOW WILL FOCUS MORE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
SOME POSSIBLY SEVERE WEDNESDAY. THE COLD FRONT WILL THEN MOVE INTO
THE REGION THURSDAY. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL REMAIN IN THE AREA
THROUGH THE WEEKEND SO WILL KEEP SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. TEMPERATURES SHOULD STAY
COOLER THAN THE PAST WEEK BUT STILL BE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

.DISCUSSION...AN APPROACHING WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PROVIDE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.  COVERAGE SHOULD 
BE QUITE LIMITED AND WILL ADD SOME LOW POPS TO THE FORECAST.  
ASSOCIATED CLOUD COVER WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE 
GUIDANCE.  OTHERWISE...ALL WELL IN THE CURRENT FORECAST...HAVE 
UPDATED GRIDS TO REMOVE LATE AFTERNOON WORDING AND ADJUST POPS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CONVECTION NOW FIRING IN
SELECTED AREAS...MAINLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN...AND ADVECTING TO
THE EAST. ALL STATIONS IN OUR CWA NOW HAVE A WESTERLY COMPONENT TO
THEIR SURFACE WIND...SO FRONTAL FORCING SEEMS QUITE WEAK. LEE
TROUGH STILL COMING TOGETHER EAST OF APPS...HELPING TO SUPPORT
WESTERLY WIND COMPONENT. THINKING THAT MOST OF THE PRECIP WILL BE
CONFINED TO THIS AFTERNOON...SO INITIAL GRIDS FOR TONIGHT WILL
HAVE POPS LESS THAN 15 PERCENT...SO NO MENTION IN ZONES. 

MODELS NOT DOING THE GREATEST JOB OF HANDLING POST-FRONTAL
STRATOCUMULUS DESK...IT SHOULD MOVE IN FOR MUCH OF THE NIGHT. THEN
LATE TONIGHT A WEAK UPPER LEVEL WAVE RACES THROUGH THE AREA FROM
THE WEST...DON'T THINK IT WILL PRODUCE ANY PRECIP...BUT WORTH
WATCHING FOR POSSIBLE SPRINKLES, ETC. THINK THAT CLOUD DECK WILL
ERODE WEST TO EAST IN THE MORNING...LEAVING THE AFTERNOON MOSTLY
SUNNY ON MONDAY.

FOR TEMPS...WILL GO ON WARM SIDE OF GUIDANCE FOR MIN TONIGHT...AS 
MODELS SEEM TO BE UNDERPLAYING STRATOCU DECK.  WILL GO CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FRONT TRACKING INTO THE 
THE AREA BRINGING A CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS ON TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER FRONT IS EXPECTED TO ENTER THE AREA ON THURSDAY 
AND LINGERS INTO SUNDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCE POPS GOING FOR THE

KTRI LOOKS LIKE THE BEST SHOT AT THIS POINT OF GETTING HIT...BUT
STORMS TRACKING TO THE NORTH OF THEM SO FAR. ALSO...CONVECTION
GETTING STARTED ALONG THE PLATEAU W OF KCHA...BUT NOT SURE IT WILL
BLOSSOM INTO STORMS. STORMS DEVELOPING IN APPALACHIANS NEAR KTYS
WILL BE HEADING TO EAST AWAY FROM AIRPORT...NOT TOO MUCH DEVELOPING
TO WEST.

.DISCUSSION...
VERY QUIET SO FAR THIS MORNING WITH A RATHER COMPLEX SITUATION AT 
HAND. SURFACE COLD FRONT STILL TRUDGING THROUGH KY AT THIS
TIME...IS EXPECTED TO SLOWLY WASH THROUGH AREA LATER TODAY. SURFACE
DEW POINTS AHEAD OF THE FRONT ARE IN THE 60S...WHICH SOUND
FAVORABLE FOR CONVECTION LATER TODAY ALONG THE FRONT...HOWEVER LEE
TROUGH IN THE CAROLINAS IS DEVELOPING AND IS EXPECTED TO GET
STRONGER AND STRONGER DURING THE DAY...WHICH WILL INDUCE MORE AND
MORE OF A WESTERLY WIND COMPONENT IN OUR AREA AHEAD OF THE FRONT.
THEREFORE LOCAL CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT WILL BE
LIMITED...GIVING WAY TO THE MORE FAVORABLE AREA NEAR THE LEE
TROUGH. THERE WILL STILL BE SOME INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE
FRONT...AND THE UPPER TROUGH IS WORKING THROUGH THE AREA AS
WELL...SO FEEL THE NEED TO LEAVE 20S AND 30S POPS IN PLACE FOR THIS
AFTERNOON FOR NOW.

FOR TEMPS THIS AFTERNOON...MODEL SOUNDINGS LOOKING A LITTLE COOLER 
OVERALL.  MIXING SOUNDINGS TO SURFACE RESULTS TEMPS A FEW DEGREES 
COOLER THAN FORECAST--WILL KNOCK OFF ABOUT ONE DEGREE ACROSS THE 
BOARD FOR HIGHS...OTHERWISE NO CHANGES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES CONTINUE TO 
PROVIDE A FOCUS FOR CONVECTION TO DEVELOP EARLY THIS MORNING...WITH 
SCATTERED COVERAGE ALREADY OVER ALL BUT SE TN AND SW NC. POPS WERE 
ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THIS LATEST RADAR TREND.

I BLENDED INTO PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS BY THIS AFTERNOON...WITH 
POPS LOWERING FROM THE NORTH...BASED ON PROGGED TRACK OF WEAK COLD 
FRONT. STORMS HAVE SPED UP A BIT...NOW MOVING EAST AT NEAR 15 MPH.
A STORM OR TWO MAY BRIEFLY PULSE UP TO STRONG OR MARGINALLY SEVERE
LEVELS.

OTHERWISE...KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS SRN MOST AREAS THIS 
EVENING...BUT DAY SHIFT MAY GET TO REMOVE THESE POPS IN THE 
AFTERNOON PACKAGE. MOS HIGHS PRETTY CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED
WITH A PREFERENCE FOR COOLER GFS MINS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT WILL BE
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES
BRINGING DRIER AIR MASS INTO THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. UPPER RIDGE WILL BE CENTERED TO THE SW AND FLOW
BECOMES NW. SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL THEN MOVE AROUND THE RIDGE INTO
THE FORECAST AREA WITH INCREASING RISK FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. SOME STORMS WILL BECOME STRONG TO POSSIBLY
SEVERE DURING THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING TUESDAY. TROUGH REMAINS
ACROSS THE EAST WITH UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWEST AND SOUTH
CENTRAL STATES. LOW PRESSURE OVER MID MS VALLEY WILL ALSO TRACK NE
INTO THE GREAT LAKES TO OF THE EAST COAST FOR THE REST OF THE
FORECAST PERIOD AND DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TN VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE
POSSIBLE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...CONVECTION FIRING SOUTHERN
AREAS FIRST AS CONVECTIVE TEMPS HIT THERE EARLIER. NORTHERN AREAS
NOW STARTING AS WELL. LOOKING UPSTREAM... WOULD EXPECT STORMS IN
CENTRAL KY TO MAKE THEIR WAY TOWARD AREA...STILL LOOKING MORE
FAVORABLE ACROSS THE NORTH VERSUS SOUTH...SO WILL KEEP HIGHER POPS
THERE. JUST ENOUGH STEERING FLOW AND COLD-POOL OUTFLOW TO KEEP
CELLS MOVING...RATHER THAN SITTING AND FLOODING.

OVERNIGHT THERE IS SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY...BUT INFLOW TO 
CONVECTION SHOULD BE WEAK...SO OVERALL WOULD EXPECT TO SEE STORMS 
SLOWLY DIE-OFF DURING THE EVENING.

DIFFICULT TO DISCERN FRONTAL BOUNDARY FOR SUNDAY...LOOKS LIKE SOME 
SURFACE BOUNDARIES AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL TAKE BEST POP CHANCES 
SOUTH AND EAST OF AREA...BUT IT LOOKS LIKE ACTUAL FRONT MAY NOT EXIT 
THE AREA UNTIL LATE SUNDAY...SO WILL KEEP IN POPS IN APPROPRIATE 
AREAS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT.

WENT VERY CLOSE TO TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE IN BOTH PERIODS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...DRIER WEATHER ENTERING 
THE AREA SO ACTIVITY SHOULD BE ISOLATED ON MONDAY. A SHORTWAVE

.DISCUSSION...
COUPLE OF OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES HAVE MOVED INTO NWRN SECTIONS OF THE 
CWA...WITH ENOUGH ELEVATED CONVECTION TO FIRE A FEW SMALL 
THUNDERSTORMS.  WE MAY GET TO THE SURFACE-BASED CONVECTIVE 
TEMPERATURES SOON ENOUGH BEFORE THE CONVERGENCE ALONG THESE 
BOUNDARIES FADES...THEREFORE...THEY COULD BE PLAYERS IN TODAY'S 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY.  THE TERRAIN WILL BE THE OTHER OBVIOUS PLAYER 
IN INITIAL DEVELOPMENT.  

LOOKING AT LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE AND MODEL SOUNDINGS...WOULD EXPECT 
CAPE VALUES IN THE 1000-1500 J/KG RANGE ACROSS THE AREA...WITH 15-20 
KT 0-6KM SHEAR ACROSS THE NORTH...VS LESS THAN 10 KT SHEAR ACROSS THE
SOUTH...THEREFORE...INDIVIDUAL STORM CELLS WILL PERSIST LONGER IN
THE NORTH AND HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF BECOMING SEVERE. WET-BULB
ZERO VALUES VERY HIGH...SO MAIN THREAT LOOKS TO BE GUSTY OUTFLOW
WINDS...WITH A STRONGEST CELLS MAYBE GETTING QUARTER-SIZED HAIL AT BEST.

WILL RAISE THE POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN SECTIONS INTO THE 40S-50S% 
RANGE...BUT LEAVE THE SOUTHERN AREAS IN THE 20S-30S% RANGE.

WILL MAKE SLIGHT TWEAK TO HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.

WENT CLOSE TO OR A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW PERSISTENCE FOR HIGHS TODAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...ONLY SUBTLE CHANGES EXPECTED 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. MODELS GENERALLY DEPICT UPPER RIDGE WHICH 
HAS PERSISTED FOR MANY DAYS WILL CONTINUE TO FLATTEN AS A SERIES OF 
SHORT WAVE TROUGHS MIGRATE THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS WILL 
PROMOTE SLOWLY FALLING HEIGHTS WHICH IN TURN IS EXPECTED TO PRECLUDE 
TEMPS REACHING LEVELS QUITE AS HIGH AS SEEN RECENTLY...ALTHOUGH 
STILL WELL ABOVE CLIMO. ALSO EXPECTING THE POTENTIAL OF SLIGHTLY 
BETTER COVERAGE OF DIURNAL CONVECTION TOMORROW AS MODEL SOUNDINGS 
DEPICT MODERATE INSTABILITY...SLIGHTLY MORE LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE AND 
VIRTUALLY NO MID-LEVEL CAP. THUS HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE POPS ACROSS 
THE ENTIRE CWA FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON. FOR TEMPS...TENDED TO USE A 
BLEND OF MET AND MAV GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...FRONT TRACKING THROUGH 
THE AREA ON SUNDAY. SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND LIFT TO 
CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY. INSTABILITY ALSO INCREASING... 
SO COULD SEE STRONG THUNDERSTORMS ON SUNDAY. DRIER WEATHER ENTERING 
THE AREA SO ACTIVITY SHOULD BE ISOLATED ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. 
ANOTHER FRONT IS EXPECTED TO ENTER THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND LINGERS 
INTO FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCE POPS GOING FOR THE REST OF THE 
PERIOD. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED MOST OF THE PERIOD. 
STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

PATCHY AREAS OF FOG...MAINLY WHERE CONVECTION OCCURRED THURSDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. VISBYS NOT THAT LOW PER SURFACE OBS...SO
JUST WORDED AS PATCHY FOG THRU 13Z TODAY...AND WILL ALSO COVER ANY
PATCHY DENSE FOG IN SHORT TERM FORECAST.

THREAT OF CONVECTION LATER TODAY DOES NOT LOOK AS GOOD AS THURSDAY 
...IF SHORT RANGE MODELS CAN BE TRUSTED. OPTED TO SLIGHTLY LOWER 
POPS OVER WRN AREAS AND VALLEY...WHICH WAS ALSO A BETTER MESH WITH 
ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AREA WIDE FOR EARLY 
TONIGHT TO KEEP CONTINUITY. 

PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRIDS LOOKED GOOD OVERALL...BEING QUITE CLOSE TO 
LATEST MOS AND HIGHS FROM YESTERDAY. HOURLY TEMPS THIS MORNING WERE 
RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES COOLER THAN GRIDS...MOSTLY IN RAIN COOLED 
AREAS. TRENDED CLOSE TO THE COOLER GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE FLATTENS OUT
SATURDAY AS WEAK FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NW. SCATTERED SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HIGH
TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES COOLER WITH MORE CLOUD COVER AND
PRECIPITATION. SATURDAY NIGHT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE
INTO THE EVENING. NAM MODEL BRINGS FRONT THROUGH BY SUNDAY MORNING
BUT GFS AND ECMWF MODELS MOVE FRONT MUCH SLOWER AND NOT THROUGH

SOME MVFR FOG AT TYS WITH AN IFR RESTRICTION AT TRI TOWARD

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE 
TO DOMINATE AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  AS A  RESULT... 
CONTINUED HOT CONDITIONS WITH A FEW DIURNAL SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORM 
POSSIBLY DEVELOPING OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  BEST LOCATION FOR 
CONVECTION CONTINUES TO BE OVER EXTREME SOUTHERN NC.  ANY CONVECTION 
SHOULD END EARLY IN THE EVENING FOR A QUIET AND WARM NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
FOR THE LONG TERM...BUT STILL SOME AMBIGUITY WITH THE DETAILS 
ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE PERIOD.  UPPER FLOW FORECAST TO BE MORE 
ZONAL THAN RECENT DAYS AS UPPER RIDGE WILL BE FLATTER...AND STILL 
POSSIBLE THAT UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME MORE NORTHWEST BY 
MONDAY/TUESDAY.  COLD FRONT WILL ALSO SAG TOWARD THE AREA BY THE 
WEEKEND...BUT AM NOT OPTIMISTIC THAT IT WILL PUSH THROUGH OUR AREA.  
WILL LIKELY BE SOME CONVECTION AROUND AT TIMES DURING THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD...BUT THE DETAILS OF HOW MUCH COVERAGE EACH PERIOD IS VERY 
UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT.  WILL GENERALLY CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS...EXCEPT FOR CHANCE POPS FRIDAY AND THE WEEKEND AS FRONTAL 
PROXIMITY MAY ENHANCE OUR CHANCES FOR PRECIP. GFS MOS TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE OVERALL.

OVERNIGHT. OVERALL LOOK FOR VFR CONDITIONS...ALTHO SOME MVFR FOG IS 
CERTAINLY POSSIBLE AT TRI WHERE TSRA OCCURRED. HOWEVER...THESE MVFR 
CONDITIONS ARE MORE LIKELY ACROSS SWRN VA WHERE STRONGER CONVECTION 
DUMPED SOME MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT RAINS. 

HARD TO DETERMINE WHERE SPOTTY TSRA COULD POP ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON

.DISCUSSION...SMALL COMPLEX DROPPING SOUTH OUT OF NE KY AND W VA HAS 
GENERALLY WEAKENED...BUT SCATTERED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS DEVELOPED 
OUT AHEAD OF THE COMPLEX AND ITS ASSOCIATED OUTFLOW BOUNDARY. GOOD 
COVERAGE OVER SW VA CURRENTLY...WHICH WAS NOT COVERED WELL IN GRIDS.
SO...I DID A QUICK UPDATE OF FORECAST GRIDS AND PRODUCTS FOR THE 
NEXT FEW HOURS INTO MID/LATE EVENING...AS THIS ACTIVITY DROPS SLOWLY 
SOUTH INTO THE TRI AREA OF NE TN.


PREVIOUS AFD...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE STILL IN PLACE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED A COUPLE HOURS EARLIER ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS OF NORTH CAROLINA AND ARE MOVING SLOWLY SW.  MCS OVER WV 
SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH TOWARD VA AT THIS HOUR AND COULD REACH INTO SW 
VA AND NE TN ABOUT 22Z AND BRING A FEW STRONG THUNDERSTORMS TO THAT 
AREA FOR A FEW HOURS. RIGHT NOW WILL JUST HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE. LOW 
SHEAR CONDITIONS MAY WEAKEN THIS SYSTEM MORE BUT OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES 
MAY CONTRIBUTE TO CONVECTION CONTINUING INTO THE EVENING. TONIGHT 
LOWS SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHTS NEAR AT 60 TRI AND MID TO UPPER 60S 
ELSEWHERE. WEDNESDAY RIDGE STILL NEARLY OVERHEAD BUT ADDING A LITTLE 
HIGHER POPS NE AND CENTRAL AREAS. TEMPERATURES STILL LOOK TO BE 
ABOUT THE SAME LOWER TO MID 90S CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE.    

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH BREAKING DOWN THE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY BY THE END OF THE WEEK...WITH A BERMUDA HIGH AT THE SURFACE 
BECOMING SITUATED IN ITS CLIMATOLOGICAL POSITION OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC. SOUTHERLY WINDS ALONG ITS WESTERN EDGE WILL BRING 
INCREASING AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK...WITH A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALSO BECOMING STATIONARY 
AROUND THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO FACTORS 
SHOULD RESULT IN A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA FOR THE WEEKEND. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL 
BECOME MORE NORTHWESTERLY OVER THE OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS BY THE 
START OF NEXT WEEK...WHICH SHOULD PUSH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY FURTHER 
SOUTH AND POSSIBLY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY. THIS FRONTAL 
PASSAGE MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC GIVEN THE TIME OF YEAR...SO WILL KEEP 
A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. IN 
ADDITION...THIS NORTHWEST UPPER-LEVEL FLOW PATTERN WILL BE CONDUCIVE 
FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME UPSTREAM MCS ACTIVITY OVER THE MID MS 
RIVER VALLEY AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA DURING THIS PERIOD. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...AND THEN WILL TREND TOWARDS THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR 
EARLY NEXT WEEK WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DOMINATE OUR WEATHER FOR THE SHORT TERM.  MODEL SOUNDINGS AGAIN LOOK 
RATHER DRY...AND LOOKS LIKE BEST CHANCE FOR ANY CONVECTION WILL BE 
SOUTHEAST AND CENTRAL MOUNTAIN ZONES...SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS THERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  OTHERWISE WILL GO DRY WITH A MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKY.  RECORD HIGH TEMPS FOR TODAY ARE CHA 96...TYS 99...AND 
TRI 93.   CHA LOOKS TO BE THREATENED AND PERHAPS TRI...SO WILL 
INCLUDE NEAR RECORD WORDING THERE. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
PATTEN EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH A STRONG RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE REGION WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  THIS WILL GENERALLY SUPPRESS 
CONVECTION...THOUGH A FEW DIURNAL SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORM WILL BE 
POSSIBLE DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON WITH BEST CHANCE OVER HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.  THE RIDGE BEGINS TO DAMPEN ON FRIDAY WITH FLOW ALOFT 
BECOMING ZONAL FOR THE WEEKEND.  A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL DROP 
INTO THE OH RIVER VALLEY...AIDING THE POTENTIAL FOR CONVECTION.  THE 
RIDGE BUILD BACK IN OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. ON MONDAY...PUTTING THE 
MRX CWA INTO NORTHWESTERLY FLOW AND DECREASING THE CHANCE OF 
CONVECTION.  AS FOR TEMPERATURES...OVERALL CONTINUED HOT...STAYED

.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS EVENING. ACTIVITY ACROSS THE 
SOUTH HAS ENDED. HIGH PRESSURE BRINGING A DRY NIGHT TONIGHT. 
TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK...NO CHANGES 
NEEDED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...NOT MUCH CLOUD DEVELOPMENT TODAY 
AS OPPOSED TO SUNDAY. UPPER RIDGE IS STRENGTHENING ONCE AGAIN OVER 
THE EASTERN TN VALLEY. RUC MODEL SHOWING SHORTWAVE OVER NC AND SC 
WITH MORE MOISTURE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE APPALCHIANS WITH ISOLATED 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING THERE THIS AFTERNOON. MUCH LOWER DEW POINT 
TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA. CURRENT AIR 
TEMPERATURES A COUPLE DEGREES COOLER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS 
THIS AFTERNOON BUT ABOUT THE SAME NORTH AS SUNDAY. MOST UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS IS ACROSS SE TN AND SW VA MOUNTAINS. FOR THE REST OF THE 
AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY HAVE ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS LATE THIS AFTERNOON BUT EXPECT 
ACTIVITY TO BE MAINLY EAST SIDE OF MOUNTAINS. TONIGHT AND TUESDAY 
MOSTLY CLEAR AT NIGHT TO MOSTLY SUNNY WITH LOWER OVERNIGHT LOWS NE 
TN VALLEYS. EXPECTING UPPER 50S THERE WITH DRIER AIR MASS BUT ABOUT 
THE SAME CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY...MID TO UPPER 60S. TUESDAY 
UPPER HIGH JUST TO THE WEST OF FORECAST AREA SO CONVECTION AGAIN 
MAINLY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS LATE AFTERNOON TO EARLY EVENING. USING 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR HIGHS TUESDAY ABOUT LIKE TODAY NEAR 90 NE 
TO LOWER TO MID 90S CENTRAL AND SOUTH.

LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS WEEK...WHICH BECOMES SITUATED OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC BY THE END OF THE WEEK. THIS UPPER-LEVEL HIGH 
SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS MOST CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY...EXCEPT AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE ISOLATED 
CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE. AS HIGH PRESSURE BECOMES SITUATED AT 
ITS CLIMATOLOGICAL POSITION OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK...SOUTHERLY WINDS ON ITS WESTERN PERIPHERY WILL BRING 
INCREASING AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY. IN 
ADDITION...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO BECOME STATIONARY 
AROUND THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY THE END OF THE WEEK. THE COMBINATION 
OF THESE TWO FACTORS SHOULD RESULT IN A BETTER COVERAGE OF 
CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE WEEKEND. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY 
MONDAY...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE SEEMS OVERLY OPTIMISTIC GIVEN 
THE TIME OF YEAR...SO WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE FORECAST 
FOR MONDAY. IN ADDITION...THINK THERE WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY FOR 
SOME MCS DEVELOPMENT FURTHER UPSTREAM OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH 
COULD THEN AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA WITH THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. 
AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

WITH MORE MOISTURE ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE APPALCHIANS WITH ISOLATED 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING THERE THIS AFTERNOON. MUCH LOWER DEW POINT 
TEMPERATURES IN THE 50S ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA. CURRENT AIR 
TEMPERATURES A COUPLE DEGREES COOLER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS 
THIS AFTERNOON BUT ABOUT THE SAME NORTH AS SUNDAY. MOST UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS IS ACROSS SE TN AND SW VA MOUNTAINS. FOR THE REST OF THE 
AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY HAVE ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS LATE THIS AFTERNOON BUT EXPECT 
ACTIVITY TO BE MAINLY EAST SIDE OF MOUNTAINS. TONIGHT AND TUESDAY 
MOSTLY CLEAR AT NIGHT TO MOSTLY SUNNY WITH LOWER OVERNIGHT LOWS NE 
TN VALLEYS. EXPECTING UPPER 50S THERE WITH DRIER AIR MASS BUT ABOUT 
THE SAME CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY...MID TO UPPER 60S. TUESDAY 
UPPER HIGH JUST TO THE WEST OF FORECAST AREA SO CONVECTION AGAIN 
MAINLY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS LATE AFTERNOON TO EARLY EVENING. USING 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR HIGHS TUESDAY ABOUT LIKE TODAY NEAR 90 NE 
TO LOWER TO MID 90S CENTRAL AND SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS WEEK...WHICH BECOMES SITUATED OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC BY THE END OF THE WEEK. THIS UPPER-LEVEL HIGH 
SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS MOST CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY...EXCEPT AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE ISOLATED 
CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE. AS HIGH PRESSURE BECOMES SITUATED AT 
ITS CLIMATOLOGICAL POSITION OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK...SOUTHERLY WINDS ON ITS WESTERN PERIPHERY WILL BRING 
INCREASING AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY. IN 
ADDITION...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO BECOME STATIONARY 
AROUND THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY THE END OF THE WEEK. THE COMBINATION 
OF THESE TWO FACTORS SHOULD RESULT IN A BETTER COVERAGE OF 
CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE WEEKEND. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY 
MONDAY...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE SEEMS OVERLY OPTIMISTIC GIVEN 
THE TIME OF YEAR...SO WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE FORECAST 
FOR MONDAY. IN ADDITION...THINK THERE WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY FOR 
SOME MCS DEVELOPMENT FURTHER UPSTREAM OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH 
COULD THEN AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA WITH THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. 
AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

ANALYSIS OF VARIOUS SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS SUGGEST THAT THE 
THREAT OF SEVERE WILL CONTINUE TO RISE OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS ON 
THE EASTERN EDGES OF WATCH 430. DEVELOPMENT OF STORMS TO THE EAST OF

SHOWN BY THE RUC. INVERTED-V PROFILE OF RUC SOUNDINGS INDICATE 
DOWNBURST WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT. THOUGH CAPE IS PLENTIFUL

.DISCUSSION...
THE PERSISTENT HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE HAS SOMEWHAT LOOSENED ITS GRIP
OVER THE AREA AS IT RETROGRADES SLIGHTLY. THIS WILL ALLOW AN MCV
ASSOCIATED WITH ONGOING CONVECTION IN IL TO TRACK TOWARD THE AREA.
SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF WEAKER SBCIN AND HIGHER DEWPOINTS
ACROSS SOUTH-CENTRAL KY TO EASTERN KY THIS MORNING. EXPECT
CONVECTION TO FIRE IN THIS AREA AS THE MCV APRROACHES THIS
AFTERNOON...MAINLY AFTER 18Z. NW MIDLEVEL FLOW WILL BRING THESE
STORMS INTO THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SW VA. SOME SLIGHT
ADJUSTMENTS TO POPS WILL BE MADE TO RAISE THEM IN THE PLATEAU...BUT
STILL STAYING IN THE CHANCE RANGE NORTH TO SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH AS
LIMITED MOISTURE AVAILABILITY WILL LIMIT COVERAGE AND PRECIP
AMOUNTS. WILL ALSO MAKE SOME SLIGHT TEMPERATURE AND DEWPOINTS
ADJUSTMENTS BASED ON OBSERVED TRENDS AND LATEST GUIDANCE.

UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WEAKENS.  WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL BRUSH AT 
LEAST NORTHERN AREAS...AND OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM CONVECTION TO OUR 
NORTH ALSO MAY HELP TO TRIGGER SOME CONVECTION TODAY.  SOUNDINGS 
LOOK MORE FAVORABLE THAN RECENT DAYS AS WELL...ALTHOUGH SOME 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE.  
WILL HAVE HIGHEST POPS NORTH...WITH POPS RANGING FROM SLIGHT CHANCE 
SOUTH TO HIGH CHANCE NORTH.  THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE 
STORMS...WILL CONTINUE MENTION IN HWO.  WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
EARLY TONIGHT...THEN DRY.  WILL BE HOT AGAIN TODAY.  RECORD HIGHS 
FOR TODAY ARE TRI 93...TYS 96...CHA 97...AND THE RECORD AT CHA 
APPEARS TO BE THE ONE MOST THREATENED.  WILL MENTION NEAR RECORD 
TEMPS IN SOUTHERN ZONES.   


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY LIMPS 
SOUTH TO NEAR THE GEORGIA BORDER EARLY MONDAY BEFORE WASHING OUT. 
MODELS INDICATE SLIGHTLY HIGHER MEAN RH ALONG WITH SOME DECENT 
INSTABILITY ACROSS SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA NEAR THE OLD BOUNDARY SO 
KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS IN THIS AREA MONDAY. UPPER 
RIDGE BUILDS BACK ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY SUPPRESSING CONVECTION ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT MAY ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER MID 
WEEK. BY THURSDAY...MODEL FORECASTS SHOW A WEAKNESS DEVELOPING IN 
THE MASSIVE RIDGE OVER THE MID SOUTH WHICH MAY PROVIDE A SLIGHTLY 
IMPROVED OPPORTUNITY FOR CONVECTION SO APPLIED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES WHILE BROADBRUSHING SLIGHT CHANCE 
PROBABILITIES AREAWIDE ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS UPPER HEIGHTS

WEATHER WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA. 1000-850 MB THICKNESS FROM
THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING INDICATE HIGH TEMPS CLOSE TO OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE
YESTERDAY'S HIGHS. A RECORD HIGH TEMP WILL BE APPROACHED AT
CHA...BUT TYS AND TRI WILL PEAK A FEW DEGREES SHORT OF THEIR
RECORDS. A STRENGTHENING MIDLEVEL RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA
TODAY...PROVIDING A STABLE TEMPERATURE PROFILE WITH PLENTY OF CIN

259 AM EDT SAT JUN 4 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND
UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA WILL DOMINATE OUR WEATHER TODAY. THE
RIDGE AXIS WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT WEST TONIGHT...AND A WEAK COLD FRONT
WILL SAG SOUTH TO AROUND THE OHIO RIVER BY 12Z. CANNOT RULE PRECIP
OUT TONIGHT ESPECIALLY NORTHERN ZONES...BUT EXPECT ANY PRECIP TO
STAY TO OUR NORTH SO WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR NOW. WILL MAKE A
FEW TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS...MAINLY TO BUMP UP SLIGHTLY. RECORD HIGHS
FOR TODAY ARE TRI 93...TYS 96...CHA 97. THE ONLY RECORD TEMP THAT
LOOKS LIKE IT MAY BE THREATENED IS AT CHA WHERE FORECAST HIGH IS
96...SO ONLY PLAN TO MENTION NEAR RECORD TEMPS IN SOUTHERN ZONES.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ON SUNDAY SHORT WAVELENGTH 
ENERGY WILL EFFECTIVELY CARVE AWAY AT THE NORTHEASTERN CORNER OF THE 
MASSIVE UPPER HIGH COVERING MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE 
NATION AS IT SHIFTS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. THE 
ACCOMPANYING SURFACE COOL FRONT WILL SLIP ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS PROVIDING A FOCUS FOR 
SCATTERED TO WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. KEPT THE 
LOW CHANCE CATEGORY FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND A SMALL PART OF 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS WELL AS THE MAJOR TERRAIN IN TENNESSEE 
BORDERING KENTUCKY AND NORTH CAROLINA. THE FRONT LOSES IDENTITY AND 
UPPER SUPPORT BY MONDAY AND LEFT POPS OUT AT THIS TIME. STAYED WITH 
A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN TUESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY AS SUBSIDENCE AND SUPPRESSION WILL BE AT WORK AGAIN MID 
WEEK AS THE UPPER HIGH FULLY RE-ESTABLISHES ITSELF ACROSS THE 
EASTERN U.S. THE MODELS HINT AT ANOTHER SHORT WAVE DROPPING 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY 
FRIDAY SO MAINTAINED THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP AREAWIDE FOR POSSIBLE 
CONVECTION. STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS SUNDAY AND MONDAY 
WHILE MAKING MINOR TWEAKS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

AREA...BASED ON A DEWPOINT GRADIENT SEEN BETWEEN TYS AND NORTHERN
GA. SOME MORNING CLOUDS AND SLIGHTLY LOWER 1000-850 MB THICKNESS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE WILL BE BUILDING 
AGAIN OVER THE AREA DURING THE SHORT TERM.  WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
SHOULD SLIP TO OUR SOUTH EARLY TODAY...WITH SOME LOWER DEWPOINTS 
CONTINUING TO FILTER IN.  LOOKS LIKE FORECAST AREA SHOULD BE MAINLY 
DRY...WITH BEST CHANCE FOR ANY CONVECTION LIKELY TO BE SMOKIES AND 
SOUTHERN MOUNTAIN AREAS...SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THERE 
TODAY...DRY ELSEWHERE.  WILL NOT ARGUE WITH MAV TEMPS FOR HIGHS 
TODAY...BUT WILL GENERALLY BUMP UP SLIGHTLY FOR LOWS TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...DID NOT MAKE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. MODELS GENERALLY 
IN AGREEMENT WITH RIDGE STILL HOLDING STRONG FOR SATURDAY BUT SHORT 
WAVE MOVING OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE WILL HELP TO FLATTEN THE 
FEATURE WITH SOME RETROGRESSION EVIDENT BY SUNDAY. THE WAVE SPILLS 
OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN STATES WITH 
SURFACE COOL FRONT DROPPING INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TO 
PROVIDE A FOCUS FOR SOME CONVECTION. THEREFORE MAINTAINED THE SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS AND ADDED A LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR HIGHER TERRAIN 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MUCH OF THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH 
CAROLINA. KEPT THE DRY PERIOD ON MONDAY AND THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
AREAWIDE ON TUESDAY WITH ECMWF/GFS HINTING AT POSSIBILITY OF UPPER 
MIDWEST CONVECTION BUILDING SOUTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
AT THIS TIME. NOT ENOUGH CERTAINTY BEYOND THIS TIMEFRAME TO CHANGE 
GOING FORECAST SO KEPT NORTH CAROLINA BORDER CONVECTION IN PLACE FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WHILE MAINTAINING A DRY REGIME ELSEWHERE. 
STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. DID NOT STRAY 
TOO FAR FROM MEX MOS MAX TEMP GUIDANCE DURING THE PERIOD EXCEPT TO 
TREND A LITTLE BELOW THE SUGGESTIONS FOR TRI MONDAY AND TUESDAY. 
WENT A FEW DEGREES ABOVE MIN TEMPS ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE PERIOD 
WHICH LOOK CLIMATOLOGICALLY DILUTED.

402 AM EDT THU JUN 2 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...REMANAMTS OF A WEAK FRONT WILL
LINGER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN REGION OF THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT.
THE DEEPEST MOISTURE REMAINS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE
CWA SO WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE SOUTHERN ZONES. WITH
INSTABILITY INCREASING ALONG WITH THE LINGERING FRONT...MAY SEE A
FEW STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING DURING THE AFTERNOON
AND EVENING HOURS. MOISTURE IS LIMITED...SO THUNDERSTORM
DEVELOPMENT SHOULD ALSO BE LIMITED TODAY AND TONIGHT. WILL SEE
UPPER CLOUDS ENTERING FROM UPSTREAM CONVECTION...BUT ABOVE NORMAL
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED AGAIN. COULD HAVE RECORD HIGHS BROKEN
AGAIN TODAY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE NATION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER...GFS 
MODEL SHOWS THIS UPPER HIGH DRIFTING FURTHER TO THE WEST THAN THE 
ECMWF MODEL BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...RESULTING IN A STRONGER NORTHWEST 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE GFS 
MODEL THEN SUGGESTS THIS NORTHWEST UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL BRING TWO 
WEAK COLD FRONTS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY AND TUESDAY. 
WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE EXPECTED WITH THESE FRONTS...WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AND TUESDAY. AS FOR TEMPS... 
WILL TREND TOWARDS THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED... 
WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS. OVERALL...A 
PERSISTENT PATTERN OF HOT AND MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS WILL LINGER 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...WITH ONLY A SLIGHT COOL DOWN WITH 
EACH FRONTAL PASSAGE.

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SHOWERS ARE DEVELOPING OVER ERN

LINGER INTO THE EVENING ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN...BUT MOST SHOULD 
DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET. RUC MODEL SHOWS SHOWER ACTIVITY PERSISTING 
WELL AFTER 00Z...BUT THIS IS LIKELY OVERDONE. 

SURFACE COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PUSH SOUTHWARD
OVERNIGHT...REACHING OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES BY SUNRISE. AHEAD OF THE
FRONT...CALM WINDS AND CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT SHOULD LEAD TO SOME
LIGHT PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING...MUCH LIKE LAST NIGHT...MAINLY NORTH.
THE NAM SHOWS THE FRONT PUSHING SOUTH OF TRI IN THE MORNING...WHICH
SHOULD MEAN SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS THERE. THE FOCUS FOR CONVECTION
TOMORROW SHOULD SHIFT TO CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS WHERE LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE WILL BE GREATER. CAPPING INVERSION WILL BE WEAKER AT CHA
TOMORROW...SO WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS THERE. ABUNDANT CAPE WILL MEAN
ANY STORMS THAT DEVELOP COULD BE STRONG TO POSSIBLY SEVERE. THE
850-700 MB RIDGE CENTERED OVER AL/GA WILL LIMIT MOISTURE
AVAILABILITY...SO QPF WILL BE LIGHT AND COVERAGE SCATTERED AT BEST.
TEMPS SHOULD TOP OUT A FEW DEGREES SHORT OF RECORD HIGHS...WHICH
ARE 91 AT TRI...98 AT TYS...AND 97 AT CHA.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE 
EXPECTED IN THE OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE EXTENDED.  MAIN 
FEATURE WILL REMAIN A STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGE POSITIONED OVER THE 
EASTERN U.S.  AN OCCASIONAL WEAK BOUNDARY WILL TRACK ALONG THE

MORNING UPDATE WILL RAISE POPS SLIGHTLY IN NORTHERN AREAS.
COMPARING AREA 12Z RAOBS TO YESTERDAY...THERE IS SLIGHTLY MORE
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND SLIGHTLY LESS CONVECTIVE INHIBITION TO
OVERCOME...MOST NOTABLY IN THE RNK SOUNDINGS. RUC SOUNDINGS AGREE
THAT NORTHERN AREAS WILL HAVE VERY LITTLE CAP...WHILE SOUTHERN
AREAS WILL MAINTAIN A CAP. LARGE CAPE VALUES...STEEP LOW LEVEL
LAPSE RATES...AND LARGE LOW-TO- MIDLEVEL THETA-E DIFFERENCE
INDICATE THAT ANY STORMS THAT DEVELOP WILL BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE.
WEAK SHEAR AND HIGH FREEZING LEVELS SHOULD BE A LIMITING FACTOR FOR
HAIL...SO DOWNBURST WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT. COVERAGE IS
EXPECTED TO BE SCATTERED NORTH AND ISOLATED SOUTH. TEMPERATURES
NEAR RECORD HIGHS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK.

OVERPOWERING THE STRONG UPPER LEVEL HIGH OVER THE REGION ALLOWING A 
COUPLE OF SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM TO FORM OVER THE CAROLINA 
BORDER AREA AND ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. NEARING THE SUMMER 
SOLSTICE AND THEREFORE THERE IS PLENTY OF SUNSHINE LEFT THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING FOR A FEW MORE THUNDERSTORMS SO STAYED WITH 
THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR MOUNTAIN CONVECTION EITHER SIDE OF THE 
GREAT VALLEY. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE SOUTHERN CANADIAN UPPER 
TROUGH BUILDING EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TOWARD THE NORTHEASTERN 
U.S. ON WEDNESDAY. WEAK SURFACE COOL FRONT PROGGED TO MAKE SOME 
PROGRESS SOUTH TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. NOT SO SURE IT WILL 
MAKE IT ALL THE WAY INTO THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...BUT CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS AHEAD OF THE FRONT MAY HAVE A 
CHANCE TO BUILD INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE IN 
SCATTERED FASHION SO KEPT A LOW CHANCE POP GOING HERE. OPTED FOR 
SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA AS RIDGE 
WEAKENS OR RETROGRADES A BIT. A WEAK BOUNDARY MAY BE LEFT BEHIND 
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN THROUGH THURSDAY AND MAY SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR 
SCATTERED CONVECTION NORTH WITH MORE ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT SOUTH. THE 
HEAT CONTINUES THROUGH THE SHORT TERM...ALTHOUGH BOUGHT INTO THE 
GUIDANCE TREND REDUCES THE MAX TEMP BY ABOUT A DEGREE EACH DAY. FOR 
MIN TEMPS WENT CLOSER TO THE MET MOS DUE TO THE UNREALISTIC 
APPEARANCE OF THE MAV NUMBERS IN THIS LATE SPRING HEAT WAVE WITH 
PLENTY OF MID 60 DEGREE SURFACE DEWPOINT AIR AROUND.   

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LAYER RIDGING REMAINS 
STRONG OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS INTO THE WEEKEND. H85 TEMPS 
>=20C IN THE RIDGE BUBBLE. NEAR RECORD HIGH TEMPS WILL CONTINUE. 
LIGHT SURFACE WINDS AND WEAK STEERING FLOW. ISOLATED AFTN CONVECTION 
WILL POSSIBLY INITIATE OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. IF STORMS DEVELOP 
THEY WILL BE SLOW MOVING HEAVY RAINERS. UPPER RIDGE SUPPRESSES SOUTH 
WITH SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGGING INTO THE AREA LATE SUNDAY. 
DECENT CHANCE OF CONVECTION ALONG FRONT SUNDAY. CHANCE OF PCPN LESS 
CERTAIN FOR MON AND TUE DEPENDING HOW FAR SOUTH FRONT AND DRIER 
AIRMASS PROGRESSES.

OVER THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AS WELL. LI'S 
ALREADY QUITE NEGATIVE THIS MORNING AND UPDRAFTS THAT CAN BREAK THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...RIDGING IS GETTING THE JOB 
DONE THIS AFTERNOON SUPPRESSING CONVECTION. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE 
THAT ISOLATED STORMS MAY FORM ON THE TERRAIN THIS EVENING IN THE 
INTENSE HEAT SO INCLUDED FOR FIRST PERIOD POP. NICE STRONG RIDGING 
HOLDS IN PLACE ON TUESDAY FOR A NEARLY IDENTICAL LOOK TO THE DAY 
WITH SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED CONVECTION ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN 
FEATURES. BY WEDNESDAY RIDGE WILL HAVE BECOME SUPPRESSED TO SOME 
DEGREE OVER THE VIEWING AREA AS AN UPPER TROUGH MIGRATES ACROSS 
SOUTHERN CANADA AND THE GREAT LAKES ON ITS WAY INTO THE NORTHEASTERN 
U.S. IN THIS CONFIGURATION THERE WILL BE A SMALL CHANCE THAT 
CONVECTION IN ASSOCIATION WITH A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY LINKED TO THE 
UPPER LEVEL FEATURE WILL BUILD SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE UPPER OHIO 
VALLEY AND MOVE INTO SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
SO PLACED 30 PERCENT POPS HERE WHILE OPTING FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE 
ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA AS THE PROTECTIVE RIDGE GETS 
KNOCKED DOWN JUST A BIT. THE HEAT WILL CONTINUE BOTH TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH MAX TEMPS A GOOD 10 TO 12 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...DEEP LAYER RIDGING 
REMAINS OVER THE AREA FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD. NEAR RECORD TEMPS WILL 
PERSIST INTO THE WEEKEND. ISOLATED AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
DEVELOP OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD SLOWLY 
INCREASE THROUGH THE PERIOD AS MOISTURE SLOWLY POOLS OVER THE REGION 
SOUTH OF AN APPROACHING FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
MOVE SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY NIGHT. A 
SIGNIFICANT COOL DOWN IS NOT EXPECTED WITH THIS FRONT THOUGH 
HUMIDITIES WILL LIKELY BE LOWER EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE CAROLINA COAST...WITH A WARM 
AND VERY MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT 
A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH WILL CONTINUE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...WITH A MID-LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION AND SUBSIDENCE 
ALOFT SUPPRESSING MOST CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER...THIS CAP 
APPEARS TO BE A LITTLE WEAKER THAN YESTERDAY...SO WILL MENTION SOME 
ISOLATED CONVECTION AROUND THE MOUNTAINS WHERE DIFFERENTIAL HEATING 
MAY BE ABLE FORCE SOME CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. THIS UPPER-LEVEL HIGH 
WILL ALSO CAUSE TEMPS TO RISE TO NEAR RECORD LEVELS FOR THIS DATE 
(CHA 95...TYS 94...OQT 92...TRI 91). AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY 
TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST...BUT WITH TEMPS A FEW DEGREES 
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WILL CONTINUE WITH ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMP FORECAST THROUGH THE EXTENDED FORECAST PERIOD. STRONG 
UPPER RIDGE AT 500 MILLIBARS IS EXPECTED BY MODELS TO REMAIN IN 
CONTROL OF THE WEATHER PICTURE INTO THE UPCOMING WEEKEND ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION. WILL CONTINUE WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS THE UPPER RIDGE RETROGRADES SLIGHTLY WEST 
DURING THIS TIME PERIOD...BUT IS EXPECTED TO BUILD BACK IN FOR NEXT 
WEEKEND. 

A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO TRY TO MOVE SOUTH THROUGH THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BEFORE 
RETURNING BACK TO THE NORTH DUE TO RE-EMERGENCE OF THE MASSIVE UPPER 
RIDGE BY SATURDAY. BASICALLY KEPT SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS GOING

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LOOKS LIKE SOME FLAT
CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER THE SMOKIES AND ERN MTNS IS ABOUT THE EXTENT OF
DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON...SO DRY AND MILD FOR TONIGHT. BOUNDARY
LAYER HAS DRIED OUT AND THERE WAS LITTLE TO NO FOG THIS MORNING...
THUS NO FOG WILL BE MENTIONED TONIGHT OR MONDAY NIGHT.

MID NIGHT SHIFT MAY BE ABLE TO REMOVE POPS FOR MEMORIAL DAY...BUT I
WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE IN FOR NOW...MAINLY FOR THE ERN MTNS.
HIGHS WILL LIKELY TOP OUT IN THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S OVER ALL BUT
HIGHER ELEVATIONS THIS AFTERNOON...ALTHO RHP (MURPHY NC) TEMP LOOKS
QUESTIONABLE (TOO WARM FOR NEARBY SITES?). ADD A COUPLE OF DEGREES
FOR MONDAY MAXES AND WE ARE AT RECORD HIGHS...SO ADDED RECORD
WORDING TO ZFPMRX. 

UPPER RIDGE AND MID LEVEL INVERSION SHOULD STILL BE QUITE STRONG
INTO TUESDAY...SO MOS POPS ARE PROBABLY TOO HIGH. WILL KEEP POPS IN
LOW SLIGHT CHANCE FOR HIGHER TERRAIN FOR NOW ON TUESDAY.  


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...WELL ABOVE NORMAL HEAT 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH SOME MINOR ABATEMENT THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY AS THE UPPER RIDGE RETROGRADES SLIGHTLY WEST. WEAK 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPS SOUTH THROUGH THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TOWARD

TO BE LINGERING OVER ERN MOST PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH SPOTTY TSRA MAINLY OVER THE SMOKIES/NE TN/SW VA.
MSAS REVEALS SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS IN PLACE...SO I WILL CONTINUE 
LOW POPS FOR EVENING HOURS. 18Z DEW POINT TEMPS AND LINGERING CLOUD

LEND MUCH CREDENCE TO COOLER GFS MOS MINS. THUS...I OPTED TO GO 
CLOSER TO A BLEND WITH NAM MOS. WINDS WILL BE LIGHT TONIGHT AND 
COUPLED WITH ANY AREAS OF PARTIAL CLEARING...THINK WE WILL SEE SOME 
PATCHY DENSE FOG DEVELOP. 

OTHERWISE...UPPER RIDGE BEGINS AN EASTWARD PUSH FOR THE WEEKEND...
BUT MAY NOT TOTALLY SUPPRESS CONVECTION...LEADING ME TO ALSO ADD 
SLIGHT CHANCE AFTERNOON POPS TO ERN MOST MTN COUNTIES ON SATURDAY.  
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON NEXT TO GSP/RNK LOW CHANCE 
LOOKS GOOD. GFS MOS TEMPS GENERALLY ACCEPTED OR A DEGREE OR TWO 
BELOW MAXES FOR SAT THRU SUN. HOPE EVERYONE HAS A GREAT EXTENDED

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...EASTERN U.S. UPPER RIDGE 
WILL CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE FORECAST AREA INTO WEDNESDAY. 
LATER WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY THE MASSIVE HIGH BEGINS TO RETROGRADE 
BACK TO THE WEST WHILE A LONG WAVE TROUGH DROPS SLOWLY INTO THE 
NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
CONVECTION ONLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. AS 
THE UPPER LEVEL STEERING FLOW BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY...ALLOWED FOR 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY AS THE POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR UPPER MIDWEST CONVECTION TO 
DROP SOUTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON THE FRONT SIDE OF

REVEAL THE LOWEST DECK IS SCATTERING OUT AT TYS AND CHA. ALL SITES

FOG DEVELOPMENT TONIGHT WILL PRODUCE LOWER VISIBILITY THAN FORECAST
ESPECIALLY AT TRI. CLOUD COVER IS KEEPING TEMPERATURES LOWER HERE
AND EVAPORATION RATES ARE THEREFORE REDUCED THIS AFTERNOON. SO
WOULD EXPECT MORE FOG HERE TONIGHT. THE ONLY PROBLEM IS THE

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN STORY FOR THE LONG

CONDITIONS WITH TEMPS CLIMBING TO WELL ABOVE CLIMO. HAVE CONTINUED
TO CONFINE ANY DIURNAL CONVECTION TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN AS
SUBSIDENCE INDUCED BY UPPER RIDGE SHOULD INHIBIT CONVECTION
ELSEWHERE. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ALONG WITH SUPPORT FROM
MANY OF THE GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS DEPICT UPPER RIDGE RETROGRADING
WESTWARD BY MID WEEK. IN ADDITION...THE GFS PROJECTS A WEAK COLD
FRONT PUSHING INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY LATE
WEDNESDAY IN RESULTING NORTHWEST FLOW. THIS MAY POTENTIALLY PRODUCE
MORE WIDESPREAD AND/OR ORGANIZED CONVECTION BY LATE WEDNESDAY.

THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS PLATEAU WILL SLOWLY WEAKEN AS IT MOVES ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA AND WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA BY 12Z. 

A WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE 
VALLEY TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING WITH ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
MOVING INTO THE AREA LATE TONIGHT. RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A 300MB 
JET WILL COMBINE WITH WEAK-MODERATE FRONTOGENETIC FORCING TO HELP 
REGENERATE CONVECTION LATER TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT. MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL BE AVAILABLE TO PRODUCE STRONG-SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS...INITIALLY OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND PLATEAU...THEN 
MOVE EAST ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

MAIN CONCERN WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS DUE TO MODERATELY STRONG 
BOUNDARY LAYER JET AND LARGE HAIL UP TO GOLFBALL SIZE. HOWEVER...CAN 
NOT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED TORNADO WITH SIGNIFICANT TORNADO PARAMETER 
FAVORABLE ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY.  

WILL MAINTAIN NPW FOR THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL 14Z GIVEN STRENGTH OF LOW

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVES 
SLOWLY INTO SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON FRI. SCATTERED CONVECTION 
CONTINUES INTO EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT. LAYER DRIES AS TROUGH AXIS SHIFTS 
EAST OF THE AREA. SOME CONVECTION MAY INITIATE OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF NE TN AND SW VA SAT BUT STORM MOTION SHOULD KEEP 
ACTIVITY JUST TO THE EAST OF MRX CWA SO LEFT POPS OUT OF SAT FOR

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...VISIBLE SATELLITE PICS
SHOW LIMITED CUMULUS DEVELOPMENT THUS FAR...AND MOSTLY FLAT
SUGGESTING SOME SUPPRESSION. THIS SUPPRESSION PLUS LACK OF ANY
ORGANIZED AREAS OF CONVERGENCE THIS AFTERNOON...SUPPORTS VERY LOW
OR NO POP FOR REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON.

SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS AND DEEP MOISTURE CONVERGENCE ARE NOTED 
OVER WRN THIRD OF TN AND MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION. STRONG TO 
SEVERE CONVECTION PROGGED TO DEVELOP THOSE AREAS THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...THEN TRACK E OR NE OVERNIGHT. MODELS TEND TO ALLOW THIS
CONVECTION TO ENTER WRN AREAS BEFORE DAYBREAK THURSDAY...THEN
WEAKEN. FAR NE TN AND SW VA AREAS SHOULD STAY DRY...SO ADDED PATCHY
FOG TO THOSE AREAS OVERNIGHT...GIVEN MOIST AIRMASS/BOUNDARY LAYER.

HARD TO TIME AND ESTIMATE AMOUNT OF CONVECTIVE COVERAGE BY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON...BUT I DID NUDGE POPS UP SLIGHTLY THAT PERIOD TO BETTER 
MESH WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. COULD GET CATEGORICAL COVERAGE BY 
THURSDAY EVENING AS COLD FRONT EASES EASTWARD...BUT HIGH END OF 
LIKELY FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKS FINE FOR NOW. 

DECREASING POPS FROM THE WEST ON FRIDAY FITS WELL WITH TIMING/TRACK 
OF COLD FRONT. OTHERWISE...GFS MOS TEMPS LOOKED GOOD AND CONSISTENT 
WITH PREVIOUS MIN/MAX TEMP GRIDS.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS INDICATING
SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE LINGERING INTO FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER
TROUGH EXITS THE AREA...WILL KEEP LOW POPS FOR THE EVENING HOURS. A
WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION ON SATURDAY. DEEPEST
MOISTURE ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF AREA SO WILL KEEP LOW POPS
FOR THE NORTHERN AREAS. UPPER RIDGING BUILDS IN BRINGING HOT AND
DRY WEATHER SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MODELS INDICATING DIURNAL
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. BUT WILL

FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK THIS MORNING WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY NOW TO 
OUR NORTH ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY REGION. 12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW 
A VERY MOIST AIRMASS LINGERING OVER THE LOCAL AREA...WITH PATCHY 
AREAS OF DENSE FOG HAVING ABOUT DISSIPATED THIS MORNING. MODIFIED

I LIKE OUR CURRENT LOW POPS IN PLACE FOR HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS AND SW 
VA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH STEERING FLOW TO PUSH ANY TSRA E OR NE AT 
AROUND 20 TO 25 MPH. THIS SHOULD KEEP VALLEYS OF E TN DRY...BUT MAY 
NEED TO WATCH NRN PLATEAU AREAS TO SEE IF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS MIGHT

WITH ANY DIURNAL CONVECTION THAT DOES DEVELOP EXPECTED TO BE 
CONFINED MAINLY TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN. GUIDANCE TEMPS ARE GENERALLY

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
MIDLEVEL RIDGING WILL SHIFT EAST OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST...AND A 
CLOSED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL TRACK FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE 
LOWER GREAT LAKES AREA THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. MODEL TRENDS HAVE 
BEEN TOWARD A SLOWER SYSTEM. A STRONG LLJ DEVELOPS OVER THE AREA 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND WE COULD APPROACH WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA IN 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS DURING THE NIGHT...AND PERHAPS IN THE VALLEY WITH 
DAYTIME MIXING THURSDAY. A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH...FALLING 500 MB 
HEIGHTS...AND AN UPPER JET STREAK OVER KY SHOULD HELP INITIATE 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO OUR WEST THURSDAY AFTERNOON...MOVING 
EAST INTO OUR AREA IN THE EVENING. WITH THE SLOWER TIMING...THE 
HIGHEST POPS WILL BE AFTER 00Z FRIDAY. GIVEN THE STRONG 
UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND FIELD THERE WILL BE A THREAT OF SEVERE 
STORMS...MAINLY DOWNBURST WINDS. THE TRAILING COLD FRONT NEVER 
PUSHES ENTIRELY INTO OUR AREA...THE NAM SHOWS IT HANGING OVER MIDDLE 
TN THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA ON FRIDAY.

A SECOND CLOSED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS AND UPPER GREAT LAKES ON SATURDAY...BUT MOST OF THE LIFT WITH 
THIS SYSTEM STAYS TO THE NORTH. THERE IS SOME UPPER DIVERGENCE AND

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LEE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A WARM AND HUMID AIR 
MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL A BROKEN LINE OF 
CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TN AND EASTERN KY...ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK 
UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE SLOWLY MOVING EASTWARD. MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN MARGINALLY TO 
POTENTIALLY MODERATELY UNSTABLE OVERNIGHT...SO THINK THAT SOME 
CONVECTION WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. WHILE 
THE LINE OF CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TN APPEARS TO BE WEAKENING... 
MODELS HINT AT MORE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT 
AS THIS UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE COOLS THE MID LEVELS AND CREATES A 
LITTLE MORE INSTABILITY ALOFT. IN ADDITION...THINK THAT SOME STORMS 
LATER TONIGHT COULD BECOME SEVERE WITH THIS ADDITIONAL INSTABILITY.

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO MENTION CONVECTION 
AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST 
TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...NOT MUCH CHANGE EXPECTED TO 
THE OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PER MODEL 
CONSENSUS. LOW AMPLITUDE...GENERALLY SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW PROJECTED TO 
CONTINUE WITH EMBEDDED SHORT WAVES KICKING OFF POTENTIAL MCS 
ACTIVITY. BEST SUPPORT FOR CONVECTION REMAINS NORTH OF OUR CWA NEAR 
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...THUS CONTINUE TO FAVOR A SOUTH TO NORTH POPS 
GRADIENT. FOR TEMPS...MAV GUIDANCE APPEARS REASONABLE...AND 
GENERALLY GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM THOSE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST IN THE SHORT TERM WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT 
SLOWLY EAST OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST EARLY IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD. 
THIS WILL ALLOW FOR GREATER ADVECTION OF GULF MOISTURE INTO THE 
AREA. WE SHOULD REMAIN CAPPED ON WEDNESDAY...WITH JUST A FEW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS POPPING UP WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. STRONGER LIFT 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO BREAK THE CAP LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY REGION. THE BEST LIFT 
WITH THE UPPER TROUGH CROSSES THURSDAY NIGHT...AND WILL HAVE LIKELY 
POPS THAT PERIOD. A LLJ IN THE 40-50 KT RANGE AND MLCAPE IN THE 
1000-1500 J/KG RANGE MAY RESULT IN SOME SEVERE STORMS THURSDAY 
EVENING. SOME PRECIP CHANCES WITH THIS SYSTEM LINGER INTO FRIDAY AS 
IT IS SLOW MOVING AND MODELS TRENDS HAVE BEEN TOWARD A SLOWER 
SYSTEM. ANOTHER SYSTEM IS CLOSE ON ITS HEELS BUT A LITTLE FARTHER 
NORTH...WHICH SHOULD BRING CHANCE POPS TO NORTHERN AREAS ON 
SATURDAY. A BUILDING RIDGE WILL PROVIDE DRY WEATHER AND ABOVE-NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY.

IN LATEST MODEL/ENSEMBLE RUNS FROM PREVIOUS RUNS. A SERIES OF WEAK 
UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL CONTINUE TO RIPPLE THROUGH A 
LOW-AMPLITUDE FLOW AS A QUASI-STATIONARY SURFACE BOUNDARY LURKS JUST 
TO OUR NORTH THROUGH MID-WEEK. POTENTIALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM 
STILL ON TRACK TO AFFECT THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY LATE 
WORK WEEK. STILL SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BETWEEN THE ECMWF 
AND GFS MODELS. TENDED TO FAVOR FASTER GFS SOLUTION SINCE IT HAS 
SUPPORT OF MOST OF THE GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY 
DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...OHIO VALLEY UPPER LOW WILL 
SHIFT SLOWLY EAST TO THE ATLANTIC COAST THROUGH THE PERIOD. STILL 
ANOTHER COUPLE LOBES OF VORTICITY TO ROTATE SOUTHEAST AROUND THE 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WITH POSSIBLE IMPACT OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THE FIRST APPEARS TO BE DROPPING SOUTHEAST 
ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN KENTUCKY EARLY THIS MORNING AND WILL MAKE ITS 
WAY SOUTH AND EAST OF THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST BY 12-13Z. 
HOWEVER MODELS SHOW ANOTHER SHORT WAVE ROTATING INTO THIS AREA 
DURING THE AFTERNOON SO KEPT THE LOW/SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING FOR A 
SHOWER HERE. HIGHER PRESSURE WILL BE MOVING INTO THE REGION BY 
FRIDAY WHICH SHOULD BRING AN END TO THE CHANCE FOR RAIN AS WELL AS 
ALLOW FOR A RETURN TO TEMPERATURES MORE TYPICAL OF LATE SPRING. 
SPEAKING OF TEMPERATURES...GUIDANCE HAS BEEN MUCH TOO WARM IN THIS 
ANOMALOUS REGIME AND IT LOOKS LIKE IT DESPERATELY WANTS TO RAPIDLY 
END THE EXTENDED COOL SPELL AGAIN TODAY AND FRIDAY. THEREFORE STAYED 
MUCH CLOSER TO IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW THE MET MOS GUIDANCE MAX 
TEMPS.   

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED AND 
SLOWLY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WILL BE IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE NAM AND THE GFS DIFFER GREATLY ON 
SATURDAY...WITH THE NAM PRODUCING HIGH CHANCE POPS UNDER THE RIDGE 
AXIS WITH SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT. THE GFS IS DRY AND IS 
PREFERRED...BUT WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING SATURDAY TO 
MESH BETTER WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES. WITH THE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTING 
TO OUR EAST ON SUNDAY...A SW FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPS. BUT A EAST-WEST 
SURFACE RIDGE AXIS NEAR THE GULF COAST LIMITS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
ADVECTION. POPS LOOK TO BE SLIGHT CHANCES AT BEST...AND MAINLY 
DIURNAL. THE SURFACE RIDGE TO THE SOUTH BREAKS DOWN ON MONDAY...AND 
LOW PRESSURE TRACKING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL STRENGTHEN THE 
SOUTHERLY FLOW. POPS RISE INTO THE CHANCE RANGE FOR MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY. THE TREND OF INCREASING POPS CONTINUES INTO WEDNESDAY AS A 
STRONGER TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS AND MS VALLEY. TEMPERATURES 
THROUGH THE PERIOD WILL RISE ABOVE NORMAL IN THE SW FLOW 
REGIME...WITH HIGHS IN THE 80S EACH DAY IN MOST SPOTS...AND APPROACH 
90 IN SOUTHERN AREAS.

PERIOD. THE PRESSURE SYSTEM EVENTUALLY ENDS UP OVER THE NORTHERN 
OHIO VALLEY BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. DEEP MOISTURE STILL IN PLACE 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH NUMEROUS 
SHORT WAVELENGTH TROUGHS SPIRALING AROUND THE LOW. STAYED WITH A 
HIGHER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE WITH LOWER POPS FARTHER SOUTHWEST. AS WITH PREVIOUS 
FORECASTS...LOWERED POPS AREAWIDE ON THURSDAY BUT MAINTAINED THE 
HIGHER PROBABILITY OF PRECIP ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AS MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW SHORT WAVE ENERGY WITH 
ASSOCIATED DEEPER MOISTURE ADVECTING INTO THIS AREA DURING THE DAY 
WITH WEAK INSTABILITY DEVELOPING WITH SLIGHTLY BETTER HEATING AT THE 
SURFACE. STAYED CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR TEMPS AS MAV HAS BEEN 
A LITTLE TOO OPTIMISTIC IN THIS PATTERN. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...AS THE CLOSED UPPER 
LOW BEGINS TO SHIFT OFF THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST THURSDAY NIGHT...AN 
AMPLIFIED RIDGE WILL BUILD TO THE WEST...AND BRING MORE SEASONABLE 
WEATHER TO THE AREA THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD. THE RIDGE WILL 
MAKE SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESS...AND BRING WARMER DAYTIME TEMPERATURES

FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...THEN AS THE 850-700 MB RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS EAST

ONE MORE DAY OF OUR WEATHER BEING PRIMARILY INFLUENCED BY THE

WEATHER.  

CLOUDS WERE WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. EXPECT SOME
DIURNAL DECREASE IN CLOUD...ESPLY SOUTHWEST SXNS...OTHW CLDS WILL
PERSIST. AS FAR AS POPS GO...WILL MAINTAIN PREV FCST REASONING
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...LIKELY NE TAPERING QUICKLY TO THE SW. LOOKS
LIKE ONE MORE PRIMARY SLUG OF DEEP MSTR WILL ROTATE BACK ACRS THE
AREA LATE TNGT INTO WEDNESDAY BEFORE A DRYING TREND ENSUES. LEANED
TWRD THE COOLER MET TEMPERATURES ERLY IN THE PERIOD.

FOR THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...SHORT WAVE RIDGING SATURDAY
THEN A TRANSITION TO JUST A BROAD SW FLOW ALOFT. NO STRONG FORCING
MECHANISMS EVIDENT...BUT INCREASING MOISTURE WILL ALLOW FOR MAINLY
DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE PERIOD. KEPT POPS IN THE LOWER END

LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS COVERS MOST OF THE THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA. WILL MAKE SOME MINOR UPDATES TO THE GRIDS AND PUBLIC
FORECASTS...MAINLY TO EXTEND CATEGORICAL PRECIP COVERAGE A LITTLE
FURTHER SOUTHWEST.

WILL ALSO MAKE SOME ADJUSTMENTS AROUND THE CHATTANOOGA AREA. NOT AS
MUCH DEEP MOISTURE EXPECTED THERE AND SOME DOWNSLOPE FLOW HAS
ALLOWED FOR BASICALLY MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES THIS MORNING. WILL LOWER
POPS IN THIS AREA AND RAISE TEMPERATURES A DEG OR TWO.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A LARGE CYCLONIC CIRCULATION WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH MOST OF THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. 
THIS WILL MEAN CONTINUED CLOUDY AND COOL CONDITIONS WITH THE HIGHEST 
RAIN CHANCES NORTH THROUGH THURSDAY. THERE WILL BE A FAIRLY SHARP 
POP GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AS THE MOUNTAINS 
WILL HELP BLOCK ATLANTIC MOISTURE TRANSPORT...AND THE STRONGEST LIFT 
WILL BE IN THE 850 MB CONVERGENCE ZONE ACROSS NE TN/SW VA. POPS 
TODAY WILL RANGE FROM CATEGORICAL NORTH TO SLIGHT CHANCES SOUTH. THE 
GREATEST QPF WILL COME TODAY WHEN ISENTROPIC LIFT IS STRONGEST...BUT 
PRECIP SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT DUE TO THE 
LACK OF STRONG FORCING DIRECTLY UNDER THE UPPER LOW. POPS AND CLOUD 
COVER WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE AND TEMPS BEGIN TO WARM CLOSER TO 
NORMAL ON THURSDAY AS THE CENTER OF THE CIRCULATION DRIFTS TOWARD 
THE EAST. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD. STAYED IN
LINE WITH A BLEND OF THE SLIGHTLY MORE PROGRESSIVE GFS AND SLOWER
ECMWF WHICH BOTH INDICATE EVENTUAL DEPARTURE OF EASTERN STATES
UPPER LOW WITH AMPLIFIED RIDGE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. WENT AHEAD AND
PULLED SLIGHT CHANCE POP ON FRIDAY WITH SUBSIDENCE INCREASING IN
ASSOCIATION WITH THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES THROUGH GULF OF MEXICO
RIDGE. STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ON SATURDAY WITH
WEAK SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPING. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A GRADUAL
INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY SUNDAY AND MONDAY SO USED A
LOW CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION EACH DAYTIME PERIOD WITH A SLIGHT
CHANCE AT NIGHT. ADJUSTED TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO TOWARD THE NEW MEX
MOS WHICH KEEPS THE WARMING TREND IN PLACE WITH A RETURN TO MORE
INSOLATION AND LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER 
THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A SURFACE TROUGH EXTENDING WEST 
OF IT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. MODELS INDICATE 
SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW WILL TRIGGER 
SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH THE GREATEST 
COVERAGE OVER THE NORTHERN HALF THE FORECAST AREA (CLOSER TO THIS 
UPPER LOW).

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE THIS MORNING TO MAKE A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. THIS WILL MEAN VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN THE 
SENSIBLE WEATHER FROM CURRENT OBSERVATIONS...WITH A NORTHWEST LOW 
LEVEL FLOW SUPPLYING BROKEN TO OVERCAST LOW CLOUDS. SOME LIGHT 
SHOWERS OBSERVED IN KY THIS MORNING ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A 500 MB 
VORT MAX AND UPPER JET STREAK...AND MAY MOVE ACROSS NORTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE AREA TODAY...BUT OVERALL LIFT LOOKS WEAK. POPS WILL 
BE IN THE CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE. DOWNSLOPE WINDS OFF THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU MAY PRODUCE SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS IN THE TN 
VALLEY...BUT WEAK COLD ADVECTION SHOULD KEEP TEMPS IN THE 60S TODAY. 
TONIGHT A MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE TROUGH ROTATES AROUND THE UPPER 
LOW...AND MAY BRING ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SHOWERS TO THE AREA.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS
EXPECTED TO TRACK THROUGH THE REGION ON MONDAY AND LINGER INTO
TUESDAY. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING WITH HIGHEST CHANCES FOR
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT WHEN THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT ARRIVES.
MODELS INDICATING ANOTHER AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKING INTO THE
REGION ON WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE CWA WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE LINGERS. DRY WEATHER
RETURNS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. MODELS INDICATING A FRONT ENTERING
THE AREA ON SATURDAY. WITH STILL UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING...WILL KEEP
ONLY CHANCE POPS FOR NOW, STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR
TEMPERATURES.

SURFACE OBS AROUND THE REGION SHOW A LARGE AREA OF MVFR CEILINGS TO
THE WEST. HOWEVER...EXPECT THAT CEILINGS IN THE TN VALLEY WILL
REMAIN PREDOMINANTLY VFR OVERNIGHT DUE TO A DOWNSLOPE WIND OFF THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. PERIODS OF MVFR CEILINGS WILL BE POSSIBLE...AND
WILL MENTION IN A TEMPO AT CHA AND TRI. VFR CONDITIONS SHOULD BE
PREDOMINANT THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. MVFR CEILINGS MAY BUILD INTO

UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH ANOTHER POTENTIAL FOR SOME SEVERE 
WEATHER (DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL).

.AVIATION...MOVING INTO AN UNSETTLE WEATHER PATTERN ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHES

THUNDERSTORM ON AND OFF THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD.  THE INITIAL LINE OF

TIMING OF ADDITIONAL CONVECTION DIFFICULT AND WILL KEEP VC WORDING

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST 
TN...WITH A SUMMER-LIKE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S. MODELS INDICATE THAT A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WITHOUT 
THE MID-LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION OF PREVIOUS DAYS. AN UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY SHOULD HELP TO TRIGGER A DECENT 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION AREAWIDE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH A 
FEW POSSIBLY BECOMING SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL AN INVERTED-V PROFILE IN THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER...WITH ADDITIONAL DRY AIR IN THE MID LEVELS BETWEEN 800 AND 
500 MB...SO THINK THAT MICROBURSTS WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH A FEW 
STORMS. TEMPS SHOULD BE LOWER TODAY (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) DUE TO 
INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND COVERAGE OF CONVECTION.

OVERALL...WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO REMOVE THE 
MORNING PRECIP WORDING...AND TO MAKE A FEW TWEAKS TO TEMPS BASED ON 
THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)... CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER KS THIS
MORNING WILL SHIFT SLOWLY EAST TO THE MO BOOTHEEL BY THE EVENING. A
STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WILL TRANSPORT
GULF MOISTURE INTO THE AREA THROUGH THE DAY...WITH POPS RISING TO
LIKELY BY AFTERNOON AS A WEAK 850 MB TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH AND 500
MB HEIGHTS BEGIN TO FALL. WHILE INSTABILITY WILL BE SUFFICIENT WITH
MLCAPE IN THE 1000-1500 J/KG RANGE...DEEP SHEAR IS WEAK AND FORCING
WITH THE UPPER JET REMAINS TO OUR WEST. THERE IS POTENTIAL FOR SOME
MARGINAL HAIL OR A FEW DOWNBURSTS...BUT ORGANIZED SEVERE ACTIVITY
IS NOT EXPECTED. PRECIP CHANCES IN THE LIKELY RANGE WILL PERSIST
OVERNIGHT AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES INTO WEST TN AND THE UPPER JET
MOVES INTO A MORE FAVORABLE POSITION. TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL
DEPEND ON HOW MUCH CIRRUS WE SEE FROM CONVECTION TO OUR WEST...AND
HOW QUICKLY SHOWERS DEVELOP. EXPECT SHOWERS TO DEVELOP LATE ENOUGH
TO ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE INTO THE LOWER TO MID 80S IN MOST LOCATIONS
OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS
EXPECTED TO TRACK THROUGH THE REGION ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WITH THE
HIGHEST CHANCES FOR SATURDAY WHEN THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT
ARRIVES. MODELS INDICATING ANOTHER AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ALONG WITH
A FRONT TRACKING INTO THE CWA IN THE MONDAY AND LINGERS INTO
WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR MONDAY WHEN THE BEST

SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM 
MAV GUIDANCE. APPEARS TEMPS WILL AGAIN APPROACH BUT NOT QUITE REACH  
RECORD THIS AFTERNOON.


LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS STILL CONSISTENT 
WITH TIMING THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER LOW FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH HIGH 
POPS JUSTIFIED INTO AT LEAST SATURDAY NIGHT. I WAS TEMPTED TO GO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED QUASI-STATIONARY 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...WITH A SUMMER- 
LIKE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S. 
MSAS ANALYSIS INDICATES A STRONGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SOUNDINGS REVEAL A MID-LEVEL 
CAPPING INVERSION DUE TO AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE 
DEEP SOUTH AND TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS CAP WILL LIKELY KEEP CONVECTION 
SUPPRESSED FOR MOST OF THE AREA TONIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE 
POPS FOR THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE THIS 
MID-LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION WILL BE WEAKER. NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
SHOULD HELP TO KEEP THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY NEARLY STATIONARY OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING NEAR IT THROUGH THE PERIOD. WILL GRADUALLY 
INCREASE POPS FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY SLOWLY APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THROUGH THE PERIOD...AND LOOK REASONABLE. WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST WITH MINS...WITH MAXES A LITTLE LOWER EACH 
SUCCESSIVE DAY AS CLOUDS AND RAIN CHANCES SLOWLY INCREASE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AN AMPLIFIED PATTERN WILL 
CONTINUE INTO THE LONG TERM PERIOD AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BE 
REPLACED BY A MEAN TROF OVER THE EASTERN STATES. MODELS BASICALLY IN 
AGREEMENT UNTIL LATE IN THE PERIOD WHEN THE GFS WAS PREFERRED. 
INITIAL CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW SHIFTS EAST FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY TO THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND WEAKENS BUT 
A TRAILING UPPER LOW WILL BE DROPPING STEADILY SOUTHEAST FROM THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS ON SUNDAY WITH ARRIVAL IN THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. BY 
12Z MONDAY. THE LOW WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTHEAST TO THE SOUTHEASTERN 
ATLANTIC COAST BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. IN THIS PATTERN...THERE WILL BE 
A CHANCE OF RAIN EVERY PERIOD OF THE FORECAST UNTIL WEDNESDAY WHEN 
HEIGHTS FINALLY BEGIN BUILDING AGAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. 
COLD AIR ALOFT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AND A NICE 
SUPPLY OF MILD AND MOIST AIR IN THE LOW LEVELS WILL ALLOW FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION OVER THE WEEKEND. BY MONDAY...A SUFFICIENT 
INFLUX OF COOL CANADIAN AIR WILL LIMIT INSTABILITY AND STAYED WITH 
SHOWERS FOR PRECIP MONDAY AND TUESDAY. BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE THE RULE THROUGH THE LONG TERM AND ADJUSTED TEMPS A LITTLE 
BELOW MEX MOS ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE PERIOD WHERE CLIMATOLOGY TUGS 
THE NUMBERS A LITTLE TOO HIGH IN THIS AMPLIFIED PATTERN.

1020 AM EDT WED MAY 11 2011

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO SHOW A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST 
ORIENTED QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN...WITH A SUMMER-LIKE AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S. MODELS INDICATE THAT A 
MODERATELY TO POTENTIALLY STRONGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP 
AROUND THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY...SO THINK SOME SEVERE CONVECTION WILL 
DEVELOP AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO 
REVEAL A MID-LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...DUE TO AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE DEEP 
SOUTH AND TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS CAP SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS ANY 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT SOUTH OF KNOXVILLE AND ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE 
SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. EXPECT THE BEST COVERAGE OF 
CONVECTION TO BE AROUND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE 
THIS MORNING TO MAKE A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO THE PRECIP WORDING...AND 
TO ADD A MENTION OF POSSIBLE SEVERE TSTORMS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS IN REASONABLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT UPPER RIDGE WILL SLOWLY SHIFT EASTWARD INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. THIS IS EXPECTED 
TO SUPPRESS DIURNAL CONVECTION OVER MOST OF THE CWA. DID CONTINUE 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS OVER THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES 
HOWEVER. GENERALLY FAVORED MAV POPS GUIDANCE. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY 
FAVORED A BLEND OF THE MET AND MAV GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...QUITE AN USETTLED
PATTERN FOR THESE PERIODS...AS UPPER RIDGE FLATTENS EARLY IN THE
PERIOD WITH A STRONG UPPER LOW APPROACHING THE REGION ON FRIDAY.
ECMWF AND GFS...AS WELL AS NAM...IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE UPPER LOW
TO LINGER WELL INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS WILL BRING INCREASING RAIN
CHANCES...PROBABLY AS HIGH AS CATEGORICAL BY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO
SATURDAY. STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS A POSSIBILITY FOR MUCH OF THE
LONG TERM...WITH SOME FLOODING CONCERNS AS WELL BASED ON DURATION
OF SIGNIFICANT RAINS. 

GIVEN MODELS CONSISTENCY AND GENERAL AGREEMENT...FELT IT WISE TO
PUSH POPS UP FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. ALSO...MORE
CLOUDINESS EACH DAY. MAX/MIN TEMP GRIDS LOOKED GOOD AND WERE NOT
TOO FAR OFF FROM THE LATEST 11/00Z GFSX MOS NUMBERS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...WITH A SUMMER-LIKE AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S. MSAS 
ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT A STRONGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS HAS DEVELOPED

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AIRMASS AROUND NEARBY DOPPLER
RADARS REMAINS QUITE STABLE THIS MORNING...SO HARD TO ACCEPT ANY
SHORT RANGE MODEL THAT DEVELOPS CONVECTION FOR OUR NE AREAS BY
DAYBREAK. THIS LENDS VALIDITY TO GFS MODEL...WITH AT LEAST
SCATTERED TSRA DEVELOPING OVER SW VA/NE TN TO ISOLATED TSRA OVER SE
TN/SW NC...BY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS. BLENDED
MOS POPS LOOKED GOOD FOR ALL BUT FAR NE AREAS...WHERE I PUSHED POPS
UP TO LOW END OF LIKELY FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS MESHES
BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS OFFICES GRIDS TO OUR EAST. 

A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH A WEAKENING CAP AS HIGHS TOP THE
80S AT MOST LOCATIONS. SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE STORMS OVER CENTRAL TN
VALLEY AND SMOKY MTNS NE INTO SW VA...WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE
HAIL THE MAIN THREATS. 

OTHERWISE...PATCHY AREAS OF FOG SEEM TO BE DEVELOPING AGAIN AT CHA
AND TYS...BUT THIS MAY BE LOCALIZED AND COULD BE COVERED IN SHORT
TERM FORECAST. MOS HIGHS HAVE BEEN RUNNING A FEW DEGREES TOO WARM
SO TRENDED CLOSER TO THE COOLER NWM MOS FOR HIGHS. HOWEVER...NAM
MOS MINS TONIGHT PROBABLY TOO WARM FOR TONIGHT. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...GENERALLY UNSETTLED 
WEATHER IN THE OFFING THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD PER MODEL AND 
ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. UPPER FLOW WILL GRADUALLY TRANSITION FROM A 
NORTHWEST FLOW AROUND UPPER RIDGE TO SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AS UPPER 
TROUGH APPROACHES FROM WEST BY THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. WEAK 
DISTURBANCES AROUND UPPER RIDGE KEEPS THINGS UNSETTLED EARLY WHILE 
UPPER TROUGH WILL TRANSPORT ADDITIONAL MOISTURE INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH THE SECOND HALF OF THE LONG TERM. MODELS 
DIFFER QUITE A BIT WITH RESPECT TO TRACK OF UPPER LOW THAT DRIFTS 
THROUGH THE REGION BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. NEVERTHELESS...HAVE CONTINUED 
GENERALLY CHANCE POPS THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM. FOR TEMPS... 
GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SEEING A FEW PATCHES OF FOG 
DEVELOPING THIS MORNING...BUT NOT VERY SIGNIFICANT JUST YET. TEMPS A 
BIT WARMER ALOFT TODAY...AND WILL CONTINUE TO WARM AS UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION INTO MID WEEK. AIRMASS WILL BECOME UNSTABLE 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY PROGGED TO 
STRETCH FROM WRN KY SE TO SW NC. IN SPITE OF VERY LOW MOS POPS FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...I WILL KEEP OUR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MAINLY 
HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. A WEAK IMPULSE WORKING AROUND OR THROUGH THE 
UPPER RIDGE MAY SPREAD MORE THAN ISOLATED CONVECTION IN BY TUESDAY 
MORNING...SOMETHING TO MONITOR FOR NOW.

OTHERWISE...MAX TEMPS LOOK TO RISE A FEW DEGREES AGAIN TODAY...BUT I 
AM NOT CONVINCED THAT UPPER 80S TO AROUND 90 DEGREES WILL HAPPEN FOR 
MORE THAN A SPOT OR TWO ACROSS SE TN. MILDER MINS OR A BLEND FAVORED 
FOR TONIGHT'S MINS WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WEAK WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY
EXPECTED TO BE ACROSS NE SECTIONS WITH UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE
CENTERED OVER THE EASTERN GULF COAST. WARM TEMPERATURES WILL MAKE
ATMOSPHERE UNSTABLE. AS A RESULT WIDELY SCATTERED TO SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SOME STORMS MAY BECOME SEVERE WITH LARGE
HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS. SHORT RANGE MODELS STRENGTHEN RIDGE WEDNESDAY
SO SLIGHTLY LESS CHANCE OF CONVECTION. NOT MUCH CHANGE THURSDAY
BUT BY THURSDAY NIGHT OR FRIDAY UPPER LEVEL LOW/TROUGH OVER CENTRAL
PLAINS INCREASES MOISTURE ACROSS TN VALLEY WITH BETTER CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS. KEPT HIGHS SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY. FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WITH CLOUDS AND BETTER RAIN
CHANCES HIGHS SHOULD BE MOSTLY 70S ABOUT TEN DEGREES COOLER.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL SHIFT 
SOUTH THIS EVENING AND BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS MONDAY. UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS 
TONIGHT AND UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE TN VALLEY ON MONDAY. WIDELY 
SCATTERED CONVECTION NEAR FRONTAL BOUNDARY THIS EVENING. LATE NIGHT 
FOG MAINLY ALONG WATERWAYS. LOW TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL N OF FRONT 
AND ABOVE NORMAL ACROSS SOUTHERN MRX CWA. ISOLATED CONVECTION AGAIN 
POSSIBLE MONDAY MAINLY ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS. TEMPERATURES WARM 
TO ABOVE NORMAL WITH ABUNDANT SUNSHINE.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS ARE IN SIMILAR 
AGREEMENT IN BUILDING MID-UPPER RIDGE NORTHEAST INTO THE MID-SOUTH 
REGION THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN MUCH WARMER TEMPS 
ACROSS THE AREA...WITH SOME AREAS CLOSING IN OR AT 90 DEGREES BY 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY IN SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. 

RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN BY LATE WEDNESDAY/EARLY
THURSDAY...AS A SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO
THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION BETWEEN 12Z THURSDAY-00Z
FRIDAY TIME FRAME. HAVE UPPED POPS SLIGHTLY FOR FRIDAY...WITH
EXPECTED SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
BETWEEN 12-18Z ON FRIDAY. 

PROGRESSIVE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT SHOULD SEND ANOTHER SHORTWAVE INTO
THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA BY 06Z SATURDAY...AND INTO
EAST TENNESSEE-SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BY 12Z SATURDAY. ECMWF IS MORE
PRONOUNCED IN PUSHING UPPER LOW SOUTHEAST INTO MISSOURI BY 12Z
SATURDAY...ALSO. BOTH MODELS ARE ALSO SIMILAR IN DRAPING FRONTAL
BOUNDARY SOUTHWEST-NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN
SATURDAY TO EARLY SUNDAY...WITH THE BOUNDARY PROGGED TO SHIFT
SOUTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY. 

PASSAGE OF THE FRONT AND CHANCES FOR SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA FROM
FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY SHOULD RESULT IN MUCH COOLER TEMPS EVEN SLIGHTLY BELOW
CLIMO FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...UPPER IMPULSE IN NW FLOW MOVING 
THROUGH AREA THIS EVENING. AVAILABLE MOISTURE IS SUFFICIENT WHILE 
COUPLED WITH WEAK LIFT FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT MAINLY ACROSS 
NORTHERN AREAS TONIGHT. NORTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES SUNDAY WITH VERY 
WEAK IMPULSE APPROACHING LATE IN THE DAY. SURFACE WARM FRONT TAKES 
SHAPE ACROSS THE AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. AVAILABLE MOISTURE IS 
LESS THAN TONIGHT. HOWEVER...COMBINATION OF WEAK LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE...UPSLOPE FLOW AND WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT SHOULD TRIGGER 
SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS THE MRX CWA. WAA BEGINS TONIGHT AND 
CONTINUES TOMORROW. TEMPERATURE MODERATED BY CLOUD COVER. USED MODEL 
BLEND FOR TEMPS AND DPS. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE WILL TRY 
TO BUILD NORTHEAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY...BUT IT DOES 
LOOK LIKE ESPECIALLY THE TRI CITIES AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AREAS 
COULD HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AS THOSE AREAS 
ARE CLOSER TO THE SYSTEM MOVING SOUTHEAST IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. 

WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR TRI CITIES AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
ON TUESDAY...WITH SYSTEM IN NORTHWEST FLOW MOVING SOUTHEAST AND ON
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS DO SHOW A LITTLE BIT
OF AN INSTABILITY INCREASE WITH HEATING ON TUESDAY...AND WITH SHORT
WAVES MOVING SOUTHEAST AROUND RIDGE...EXPECT SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE
POPS ON TUESDAY IN ALL AREAS...EXCEPT SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST
NORTH CAROLINA. 

WILL KEEP TEMPS A LITTLE LOWER THAN GFS GUIDANCE FOR NOW...BUT THIS
WILL BEAR WATCHING FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...ESPECIALLY IN
SOUTHEAST COUNTIES. MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT A COLD FRONT
WILL PUSH INTO THE REGION AND WEAKEN ON THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY.
WILL KEEP IN LOW CHANCE POPS FOR NOW WITH THIS SYSTEM. ECMWF/GFS
DIFFER IN FORECAST INVOLVING STEM FOR SATURDAY...WITH GFS BEING
MUCH DRIER THAN ECMWF. WILL GO WITH A COMPROMISE FOR NOW WITH
CHANCE POPS FOR THE LAST PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. TEMPS LOOK
GENERALLY GOOD INVOLVING THE MODEL NUMBERS AND WILL GO WITH COOLER
TEMPS INTO NEXT WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM...COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO OHIO VALLEY REGION WILL
CONTINUE TO SPREAD AN AREA OF SHRA/EMBEDDED TSRA TOWARD THE
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. WILL ONLY SLIGHTLY AMEND GOING
FORECAST TO ACCOUNT FOR ANY CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE OF PRECIP FOR 
AFTERNOON. WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP SMOKYS/SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA
DRY WITH ONLY MID-HIGH CLOUDS EXPECTED TO ADVANCE INTO THAT PART OF
FORECAST AREA BY LATE AFTERNOON.

12Z OHX SOUNDING STILL RELATIVELY DRY...WITH HIGH PRESSURE AT
SURFACE RETREATING TOWARD THE ATLANTIC COAST...SO NOT EXPECTING
MUCH IN WAY OF PRECIP TO MAKE IT MUCH PAST PLATEAU/TOWARD SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA BY LATE AFTERNOON. TEMPS LOOK GENERALLY GOOD AND WILL NOT
BE MAKING MUCH IN THE WAY OF CHANGES TO THE GOING FORECAST.

ALOFT. EXPECT MAINLY INCREASING CLOUDS FOR TODAY...WITH BEST CHANCES 
FOR CONVECTION ACROSS SW VA AND NRN MOST PARTS OF E TN THIS EVENING 
AND OVERNIGHT. NOT MUCH INSTABILITY INDICATED...BUT POSSIBLE 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY SUPPORTS CONTINUING A MENTION OF TSRA. DID DROP 
THUNDER AFTER 06Z SUNDAY.  

OTHERWISE...MOS HIGHS LOOK QUITE REASONABLE FOR TODAY...THEN A BLEND 
OF COOLER GFS MOS WITH NAM MOS FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SYSTEM IN NW FLOW WILL
CONTINUE ACROSS EXTREME NE AND EASTERN SECTIONS SUNDAY MORNING BUT
RIDGING ALOFT WILL KEEP SHOWERS LIMITED. INSTABILITY INCREASES WITH
HEATING SO ALL AREAS HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER SUNDAY AFTERNOON.
NO POPS SUNDAY NIGHT AS CONVECTION DIES DOWN DUE TO LOSS OF
HEATING. TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER SUNDAY. RIDGING EVEN
STRONGER MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES ABOUT 5
DEGREES WARMER IN THE 80S. SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY AS
SHORT WAVES MOVE SOUTHEAST AROUND RIDGE. BEST CHANCE OF
PRECIPITATION WILL BE IN THE NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS AND EASTERN
MOUNTAINS. THURSDAY GFS SHOWS COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE REGION
WITH UPPER TROUGH TO MOVE IN FRIDAY. ECMWF A DAY SLOWER WITH

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION PROJECTED TO REMAIN IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE BULK 
OF THE LONG TERM AS UPPER RIDGE AMPLIFIES OVER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
VALLEY REGION. STILL SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS AMONG MODELS AS 
OUR REGION REMAINS ON THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF UPPER RIDGE. A SERIES 
OF SHORTWAVES PROJECTED TO TRANSLATE ALONG THIS PERIPHERY...BUT 
EXACT TRACK OF THESE FEATURES STILL UNCERTAIN. THUS...AGAIN HAVE NOT 
MADE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST. A POTENTIALLY 
MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM MAY AFFECT THE AREA LATE IN THE LONG TERM AS 
AN UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST BUT 
TIMING DIFFERENCES AMONG MODELS AND WIDE SPREAD AMONG GEFS ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS MAKE THIS EVENT UNCERTAIN AS WELL. DUE TO HEIGHT RISES 
ASSOCIATED WITH AMPLIFYING UPPER RIDGE...TEMPS EXPECTED TO MODIFY TO

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE MID WEST...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER TO MID 30S ACROSS 
THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A FEW CLOUDS 
LINGERING OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MID ATLANTIC AND NORTHEAST 
REGION. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD COMPLETELY DIMINISH OVERNIGHT...AS THIS 
UPPER TROUGH SWINGS EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA AND HIGH PRESSURE 
SETTLES OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. WITH LIGHT WINDS AND 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT...EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL COOLING 
CONDITIONS WILL DEVELOP WITH MINS NEARING THE RECORD LOWS FOR THE

TONIGHT WHILE UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BUILD ACROSS THE AREA ON
THURSDAY. IN THE NEAR TERM...THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE THAT THERE
COULD BE A BRIEF SHOWER AT TRI WITH A LOW VFR CEILING HERE. BUT THE
BALANCE OF THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD SHOULD BE IMPROVEMENT AS THE LOW
LEVELS DRY OUT ON NORTHERLY FLOW BEHIND THE DEPARTING SYSTEM. VFR
FLIGHT CONTINUES ON THURSDAY AS SURFACE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS EAST OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED ACROSS 
THE FAR WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY EARLY THIS MORNING. AN UPPER TROUGH 
WILL STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES LATE TODAY AND TUESDAY 
HELPING TO PULL THE FRONT SLOWLY TOWARD THE PLATEAU THIS EVENING. 
AIRMASS WILL BECOME MARGINALLY UNSTABLE WITH CAPES OF 500-1000 J/KG 
AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY. SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG 
AND JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND 
POSSIBLE WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. A FEW STORMS COULD BECOME SEVERE WITH THE 
GREATEST CONCERN BEING DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL UP TO QUARTER 
SIZE. 

THE BOUNDARY WILL MOVE INTO THE WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA TONIGHT CONTINUE THE CHANCES OF CONVECTION WITH THE BEST 
CHANCES WEST AND SLIGHT POPS EAST.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS NUMBERS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.


.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...GENERALLLY TOOK A BLEND OF THE 
GFS/ECMWF FOR THE LONG TERM WHICH FEATURES A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
PATTERN EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH SLOW MOVING UPPER TROF INITIALLY 
EXTENDING FROM THE GREAT LAKES SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
EARLY ON TUESDAY. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL BE PROGRESSING 
STEADILY EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AND CONVECTION 
SHOULD ACCOMPANY THE FRONT. MUCH OF THE CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN 
SUB-SEVERE BUT THERE IS A CHANCE THAT SOME OF THE STORMS THAT 
DEVELOP ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MAY BECOME 
SEVERE DUE TO BETTER SHEAR IN PROXIMITY TO A SURFACE LOW THAT WILL 
BE SHIFTING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS DURING THE 
DAY. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL BE BUILDING INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE 
FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT AND THE UPPER TROF WILL BE SLOW TO EXIT THE 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATES 
SOUTHEAST AROUND A DEVELOPING CLOSED LOW. THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
MOISTURE AND LIFT FOR A CHANCE OF SHOWERS MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY. NORTHERLY WINDS...CLOUDS AND 
POSSIBLE SHOWERS WILL KEEP HIGH TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL ON 
WEDNESDAY WITH ANOTHER COLD NIGHT IN STORE WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHICH 
WILL END UP WITH MIN TEMPS ABOUT 10 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. A 
SLOW WARMING WILL BEGIN ON THURSDAY AS SUNSHINE RETURNS WITH SHORT 
WAVE RIDGING BUILDING EAST ACROSS THE AREA. ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROF 
WITH SURFACE REFLECTION WILL MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FROM 
EARLY FRIDAY MORNING THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY EVENING AND KEPT SLIGHT 
AND SMALL CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS WITH THIS FEATURE. 
ANOTHER BRIEF DRY PERIOD REMAINS IN THE FORECAST FROM LATE FRIDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY. HOWEVER...GFS/ECMWF/CANADIAN MODELS 
INDICATE YET ANOTHER SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM 
BUILDING RAPIDLY SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS DURING THE SUNDAY TIMEFRAME AND SO USED A LOW CHANCE 
POP FOR SUNDAY WHILE BRACKETING WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE 
EVENT ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY NIGHT DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN 
TIMING DURING THIS REMOTE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST.

.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS EVENING. RADAR INDICATING A 
FEW ECHOES TRACKING IN FROM THE WEST...BUT DRY BOUNDARY LEVEL SHOULD 
SUPPRESS ANY PRECIPITATION FOR MOST OF TONIGHT SO WILL KEEP A 
DRY FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST 
ON TRACK...NO CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A 
LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALONG IT. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
THAT THE EARLIER PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
HAS DISSIPATED OVER THE FORECAST AREA. LAST NIGHT'S CONVECTIVE 
SCENARIO MAY REPEAT ITSELF AGAIN TONIGHT...BUT WILL ONLY MENTION 
SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE MORNING ON MONDAY FOR NOW. THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
ON MONDAY...WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. THUS...EXPECT SOME SCATTERED 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE AFTERNOON...WITH A FEW STORMS POSSIBLY 
BECOMING SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TONIGHT AND 
MONDAY...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTH CENTRAL STATES MONDAY EVENING SLOWLY MOVES EAST 
THE NEXT TWO DAYS. THE COLD FRONT OVER THE LOWER OHIO AND MID MS 
VALLEY TODAY WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE EAST AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
ATLANTIC STRENGTHENS AND A SURFACE WAVE MOVES UP ALONG THE FRONT 
MONDAY NIGHT. WILL ONLY HAVE GRADUAL INCREASE IN POPS MONDAY NIGHT. 
STRONG SHORTWAVE KICKS THROUGH MS VALLEY TUESDAY MORNING AND MOVES 
FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE TUESDAY. NAM MODEL FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS SHOW ATMOSPHERE MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH A LINE OF STORMS 
DEVELOPING MONDAY NIGHT AND MOVING FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. A FEW SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE 
IN THE MORNING WEST AND EASTERN SECTIONS EARLY AFTERNOON. HEAVY RAIN 
A POSSIBILITY WITH TUESDAYS CONVECTION SO LOCALIZED FLOODING COULD 
OCCUR PLATEAU AREAS. SHOWERS SHOULD END FROM WEST TO EAST TUESDAY 
NIGHT EARLY WEDNESDAY. UPPER LEVEL ENERGY AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE TROUGH BRINGS A FEW SHOWERS TO NE HALF WEDNESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THURSDAY. A SERIES OF WEAKER 
SYSTEMS MOVE SOUTHEAST FROM THE GREAT LAKES FRIDAY WITH THE FIRST 
SYSTEM GRAZING SW VA AND NE TN FRIDAY AND THE NEXT SYSTEM A LITTLE 
STRONGER DEVELOPING A WARM FRONT ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS SATURDAY

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE MS RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT EXTENDING 
FROM NEAR CINCINNATI TO NEAR ASHEVILLE. AREA RADARS REVEAL THAT A 
PRE-FRONTAL LINE OF CONVECTION FROM THE MS RIVER VALLEY HAS MOVED 
ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS MORNING...BUT IT APPEARS THAT IT 
HAS SLOWED ITS EASTWARD MOVEMENT. MOST OF THIS RAIN SHOULD DIMINISH 
IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS...BUT ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY MAY 
REDEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON ALONG ITS OUTFLOW BOUNDARY AS THE AIR MASS 
BECOMES MARGINALLY UNSTABLE. SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS SHOULD DEVELOP 
THIS AFTERNOON...BUT WILL GENERALLY BE PESSIMISTIC WITH CLOUD COVER 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING MAINLY TO LOWER POPS 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN TO OUR 
EAST WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR WEST FOR THE SHORT TERM.  WILL SEE 
VARYING AMOUNTS OF HIGH/MID CLOUDS MOVING ACROSS THE AREA. NOT MUCH 
INSTABILITY FOR OUR AREA...BUT CONVECTION TO OUR WEST MAY MANAGE TO 
MAKE IT INTO AT LEAST WESTERN PARTS OF OUR AREA...SO WILL INCLUDE  A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ALL BUT FAR EASTERN ZONES 
TODAY.  MAV TEMPS AGAIN LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROF WILL BE 
MAKING THE JOURNEY FARTHER NORTHEAST THROUGH CANADA ON MONDAY 
LEAVING A SOUTHWEST FLOW IN PLACE ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN VERY LIMITED EASTWARD PROGRESS OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
JUST WEST OF THE WFO MRX FORECAST AREA SO KEPT MOST AREAS DRY ON 
MONDAY WITH A SLIGHT OR SMALL CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ON 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. LATER MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY TRAILING 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY SWINGS EAST TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INDUCING 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE ON THE NEARLY STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER 
LOUISIANA. THE UPPER TROF ADVANCES STEADILY EAST ACROSS THE EASTERN 
U.S. TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WHILE THE SURFACE LOW SHIFTS NORTHEAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE LOW WILL DRAG THE COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. ADJUSTED THE 
POPS GRADUALLY HIGHER FROM MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AS 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVERSPREAD THE REGION. INSTABILITY APPEARS 
TO BE RATHER WEAK DURING THIS PERIOD SO CONVECTION LOOKS LIKE IT MAY 
REMAIN NON-SEVERE AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. UPPER 
TROF DEEPENS INTO A CLOSED LOW ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS WITH 
SLOW NORTHEAST MOVEMENT ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. THROUGH 12Z 
THURSDAY. MODELS INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS 
THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY AS A SHORT 
WAVE TROF ROTATES SOUTHEAST AROUND THE UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION. WAS 
ABLE TO KEEP THE DRY PERIOD WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT 
AS AN UPPER RIDGE TRAVERSES THE REGION. WENT WITH LOW CHANCE POPS 
NORTH WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POP SOUTH FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT AS MODELS 
BRING ANOTHER UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. SYSTEM EXITS BY SATURDAY ALLOWING A 
RETURN TO SOME SUNSHINE FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND. 
TEMPERATURE FORECAST A LITTLE TRICKY MAINLY ON TUESDAY AS HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED UPPER TROF PRESSES EAST WITH UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR 
BUILDING IN BEHIND THE FRONT ALONG WITH INSOLATION LIMITING CLOUDS 
AND RAIN. MODELS SHOW A TIGHT TEMPERATURE GRADIENT WITH MUCH WARMER 
AIR NEAR THE APPALACHIANS AND COLDER AIR OVER THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. TEMPERATURES WILL BE AT LEAST TEN DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON 
WEDNESDAY AND THEN WILL REBOUND CLOSER TO NORMAL FOR THE REMAINDER 
OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
MOVE SLOWLY EAST FROM THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES MONDAY TO THE EASTERN 
LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY AND DEEPEN BY TUESDAY EVENING. A COLD FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL MOVE ONLY VERY SLOWLY SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH 
AS A RIDGE OVER THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD BLOCKS A MORE RAPID EASTWARD

MONDAY AND MOST OF THE MONDAY NIGHT. HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES TUESDAY

TUESDAY EITHER. AIR MASS WILL BECOME UNSTABLE BOTH MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY. STILL LOOKS LIKE A 
SHORT WAVE LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WILL BRING A SURFACE WAVE 
ALONG THE FRONT AND FINALLY SHIFT IT EAST WEDNESDAY MORNING. HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL PREVAIL WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. 
ANOTHER TROUGH THOUGH NOT AS DEEP WILL BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS TO THE REGION FRIDAY BUT WILL MOVE OUT QUICKLY WITH SATURDAY 
DRY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL MONDAY BUT BECOME COOLER WITH

WILL SLIP ONLY VERY SLOWLY SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS RIDGING

SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. A TRAILING SHORT WAVE 
INITIALLY OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. WILL KICK THE SLOW MOVING UPPER 
TROF EASTWARD LATER MONDAY INTO TUESDAY DRIVING A WAVE OF LOW 
PRESSURE NORTHEAST FROM SOUTHERN TEXAS TO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC COAST 
BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. KEPT THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY 
NIGHT AS THE SURFACE WAVE DRAGS THE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. TRAILING UPPER LEVEL ENERGY DROPS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE 
NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE REGION BEHIND THE COLD FRONT DURING THE 
FIRST HALF OF THE DAY WEDNESDAY AND APPLIED SOME WRAP AROUND SHOWERS 
MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR THIS 
POSSIBILITY. HIGH PRESSURE ALLOWS FOR A DRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT BUT YET ANOTHER UPPER TROF WITH ASSOCIATED FRONTAL 
SYSTEM BUILDS INTO THE REGION ON FRIDAY AND KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE LATE WEEK FROPA.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE FRONT IS EAST OF THE CWA. WITH
SOME LINGERING MOISTURE...WILL KEEP LOW POPS FOR THE NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE CWA, NO THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED TODAY. UPPER TROUGH
TRACKING THROUGH TONIGHT. WILL KEEP LOW POPS FOR THE NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE AREA. GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES LOOKED
REASONABLE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT SO DID NOT STRAY TOO FAR.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE EXTENDED FORECAST...AND SHOWS A QUIET PERIOD 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND UNTIL ANOTHER COLD FRONT ARRIVES EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL SWING ACROSS THE OHIO AND TN 
RIVER VALLEYS ON FRIDAY MORNING...BRINGING MOSTLY CLOUDS AND A FEW 
SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
THEN BUILD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND...BRINGING 
COOLER BUT MORE NORMAL TEMPS FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS ARE STILL SHOWING SOME INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE PROGRESSION 
OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT...BUT BOTH AGREE THAT IT WILL BE SLOW-MOVING 
AND SHOULD AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA IN THE SUNDAY NIGHT TO TUESDAY 
TIME FRAME. ECMWF MODEL CONTINUES TO BE MORE AMPLIFIED WITH AN 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT...WHICH WOULD RESULT IN 
MORE RAINFALL (COMPARED TO THE GFS). BOTH MODELS AGREE THAT 
INSTABILITY WILL BE MARGINAL WITH THIS NEXT FRONT...SO THINK ANY 
SEVERE THREAT WITH IT WOULD BE MINIMAL. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND 
CLOSE TO THE GFS NUMBERS WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE 
ENSEMBLE MEANS.

224 PM EDT WED APR 27 2011

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER REMAINS HIGH OVER PORTIONS OF THE AREA. 
MESOANALYSIS INDICATES THE BEST INSTABILITY IS LOCATED ACROSS AL/MS. 
AS A SURFACE LOW TRANSLATES FROM AR TO IN THIS EVENING...THIS AREA 
OF INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED TO LIFT NORTHEAST AS WELL. THE POSITION 
OF THE JET EXIT REGION OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL FURTHER 
ENHANCE LIFT. THIS WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF STORMS TO THE AREA 
THIS EVENING. LOW LEVEL SHEAR WILL REMAIN FAVORABLE FOR SOME TORNADO 
POTENTIAL...ALONG WITH DAMAGING STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS AND LARGE HAIL. 
ESTIMATE THE TIMING OF THIS NEXT ROUND WILL BE 23Z-06Z. 

SURFACE WIND OBSERVATIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS HAVE BEEN IN THE UPPER 
END OF WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA. MODELS SHOW A 50-60 KT SOUTHERLY LOW 
LEVEL JET WILL BE IN PLACE THIS EVENING...SO A HIGH WIND WARNING 
WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE MOUNTAINS OF TN. WILL ALSO EXTEND THE WIND
ADVISORY FOR THE REST OF THE AREA TO 06Z. WINDS SHOULD DROP OFF
WITH FROPA ONCE WINDS TURN MORE WESTERLY AFTER 06Z.

A GOOD PUSH OF COLD AIR FOLLOWS THE FRONT TOMORROW. AFTER SOME 
MORNING CLOUDS...WE SHOULD SEE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES BY AFTERNOON. 
TEMPS WILL BE BELOW NORMAL...WITH HIGHS IN THE 60S TO LOWER 70S. THE 
PASSAGE OF AN UPPER TROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY MORNING WILL BRING 
A LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS...AND KEEP TEMPS BELOW NORMAL FOR 
FRIDAY. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE 40S THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
FRIDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL EARLY IN THE EXTENDED FOR QUIET WEATHER
THIS WEEKEND. A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH AROUND THE MONDAY TIME
FRAME FOR OUR BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION DURING THE EXTENDED. THE
FRONT SLOWS DOWN TO OUR EAST AND WILL KEEP A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS
OVER EASTERN ZONES INTO TUESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK IN FOR
WEDNESDAY. FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK GOOD AND STAYED CLOSE.

.DISCUSSION...
THE THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS AND TORNADOES WILL CONTINUE INTO THE
EVENING AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST AND AN UPPER JET
NOSES INTO NRN AL AND MIDDLE TN. CURRENT STORMS HAVE SHOWN AN
OVERALL WEAKENING TREND AS THEY HAVE MOVED EASTWARD...WITH THE
EXCEPTION OF THE TORNADIC STORM MOVING UP THE VALLEY. SATELLITE
SHOWS CLEARING BEHIND THESE STORMS...WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR THE
SURFACE INSTABILITY TO REBOUND THIS AFTERNOON. SUPERCELL AND
TORNADO PARAMETERS REMAIN FAVORABLE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING...AND LIFT WILL BE ENHANCED BY DIVERGENCE IN THE EXIT
REGION OF THE UPPER JET STREAK. EXPECT THIS SECOND ROUND OF STORMS
TO AFFECT THE AREA BETWEEN 22Z AND 04Z.

OVERALL...THE FORECAST GRIDS LOOK TO BE ON TRACK...SO NO UPDATE
WILL BE NEEDED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...STAYED WITH GOOD CHANCE 
THROUGH LIKELY PROBABILITIES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
OVERNIGHT. THE MOST LIKELY SCENARIO IS FOR A MAJOR OUTBREAK OF 
SEVERE CONVECTION ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THROUGH THE 
EVENING HOURS. THE CONVECTION SHOULD CONTINUE EAST INTO MIDDLE 
TENNESSEE LATER TONIGHT BUT WILL WEAKEN TO SOME DEGREE AS IT SHIFTS 
EAST INTO WFO CWFA. THE CONVECTIVE LINE MAY PRODUCE SEVERE WIND 
GUSTS ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BUT MAY WEAKEN AS IT MOVES INTO 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AS THE JET SUPPORT MOVES AWAY TO THE NORTH. THE 
STORM PREDICTION CENTER HAS CONTINUED TO FORECAST A LARGE MODERATE 
RISK OF SEVERE CONVECTION FROM NEAR LAKE ERIE SOUTH THROUGH ALL OF 
KENTUCKY AND MOST OF TENNESSEE INCLUDING ALMOST THE ENTIRE FORECAST 
AREA. SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS ARE IN PLACE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
TORNADIC SUPERCELL THUNDERSTORMS AS VERY STRONG SHEAR WITH HIGH 
HELICITY IS EXPECTED ESPECIALLY ON THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. INSTABILITY WILL BE ADEQUATE CONSIDERING THE VERY STRONG SHEAR 
THAT WILL BE DEVELOPING. THE LINE OF SEVERE CONVECTION WILL MOVE 
ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU LATER IN THE AFTERNOON AND WILL CONTINUE 
EAST THROUGH THE EVENING. ISSUED A WIND ADVISORY FOR WEDNESDAY AS A 
STRONG LOW LEVEL JET WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE REGION DURING THE DAY. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...DEEP CONVECTION AND 
SEVERE THREAT CONTINUES WEDNESDAY NIGHT. PWAT VALUES BRIEFLY IN 
EXCESS OF 1.50...AS AXIS OF BEST MOISTURE MOVES EAST OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHAINS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HEAVY RAINFALL IS EXPECTED BUT 
DURATION SHOULD FALL SHORT OF AREAL FLOODING SO WILL NOT ISSUE FLOOD 
WATCH WITH THIS PACKAGE. COLD FRONT WILL BE EAST OF AREA THU WITH

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEY. A LINE OF PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TN EARLY THIS 
MORNING IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EAST-NORTHEAST TOWARDS THE 
FORECAST AREA...AND THE STRONGER DYNAMICS WITH ITS ASSOCIATED LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES NORTHWARD TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. 
WHILE THIS COLD FRONT IS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE MUCH PROGRESS TO THE 
EAST TODAY...OUTFLOW FROM THIS CONVECTIVE LINE WILL LIKELY HELP TO 
TRIGGER A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
AFTER SUNRISE. WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA...THINK THAT SEVERE STORMS WILL AGAIN 
DEVELOP TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. IN ADDITION...MODELS INDICATE THAT 0-3 KM 
HELICITY VALUES WILL BE HIGHER (200-300 M2/S2) TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
AND FAVORABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW ISOLATED TORNADOES. THE 
GFS AND NAM MODELS ARE REVEALING DIFFERENT CONVECTIVE SCENARIOS FOR 
TONIGHT...WITH THE GFS MODEL INDICATING A STRONG CONVECTIVE LINE 
MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT WITH THE 
POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL. SINCE THIS POSSIBILITY IS 24 HOURS 
AWAY AND STILL UNCERTAIN...WILL NOT PLAN TO ISSUE ANY FLOOD WATCHES 
YET...AND WILL LET LATER SHIFTS DECIDE. MODEL SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO 
REVEAL AN INVERTED V PROFILE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER...WHICH SHOULD 
HELP TO CONTINUE THE THREAT FOR DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS WITH SOME 
STORMS. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE. OVERALL... 
WILL GENERALLY TREND A LITTLE COOLER WITH MAXES FOR TODAY WITH THE 
EXPECTED INCREASE IN CONVECTION AND CLOUDS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...FRONT TRACKING THROUGH THE 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WITH STRONG DYNAMICS EXPECTED 
WILL KEEP LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS ON WEDNESDAY AND CATEGORICAL 
POPS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH FROPA...COULD SEE STRONG TO SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. UPPER 
TROUGH TO THE NORTH WILL TRIGGER A FEW SHOWERS ON THURSDAY...BUT 
BEST CHANCES SHOULD BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AREAS. HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS INTO THE REGION BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. 
A COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO ENTER THE SUNDAY AND LINGERS INTO 
MONDAY. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING FOR BOTH PERIODS. STAYED NEAR

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SHOULD BE AN ACTIVE PERIOD 
AS TWO MAIN SHORT WAVE FEATURES MOVE NORTHEAST OUT OF THE LOWER AND 
MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR CONVECTION GOING EARLY THIS EVENING AS WEAK TO MODERATE 
INSTABILITY AND A NICE SOUTHERLY FLOW COULD ACTIVATE AN ISOLATED 
STORM IN SPOTS. TRIED TO ADJUST POPS A LITTLE HIGHER TOWARD DAYBREAK 
AS THERE WILL BE A CHANCE FOR OUTFLOW BOUNDARY DRIVEN SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FROM CURRENT SEVERE CONVECTION ON THE EASTERN EDGE OF 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO MAKE IT INTO WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA TUESDAY MORNING. APPLIED LIKELY POPS ACROSS THE WESTERN THIRD 
WITH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS REMAINDER OF THE VIEWING AREA FOR THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS AS STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW WITH SUFFICIENT 
INSTABILITY WILL BE IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE MAIN EVENT EXPECTED ON 
WEDNESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY POWERFUL 90-100 KT UPPER LEVEL JET WILL BE 
ADVANCING ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. WHILE DEEP SURFACE LOW SWINGS 
NORTHEAST FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. 
THE LOW WILL PULL A STRONG COLD FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA BY 
LATE AFTERNOON. THE STORM PREDICTION CENTER HAS PLACED MUCH OF THE 
MRX CWFA IN A MODERATE RISK FOR SEVERE CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY AS A 
50-60KT LOW LEVEL JET MOVES INTO THE REGION. 0-1KM HELICITY VALUES 
WILL BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT (250-350 M2/S2) FOR ROTATING STORMS 
WITH ADEQUATE INSTABILITY. ADJUSTED HIGH PROBABILITIES FOR SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS SLIGHTLY AHEAD IN TIME AS SEVERE CONVECTION MAY 
ARRIVE A LITTLE EARLIER THAN PREVIOUSLY EXPECTED. STILL LOOKS LIKE 
SEVERE CONVECTION WILL BE ONGOING INTO THE EVENING HOURS WEDNESDAY 
AS COLD FRONT SHOULD NOT ADVANCE TO THE APPALACHIAN SPINE UNTIL LATE 
EVENING.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER TROUGH REMAINS 
NORTH OF THE AREA THURSDAY. POST FRONTAL NW FLOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE 
MAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS. BRIEF COOL PERIOD WHILE HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS INTO THE REGION FROM THE WEST. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
DOMINATES AND LAYER HEIGHTS RISE FRI/SAT. GOOD WARM UP WITH DRY 
CONDITIONS. THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM IS A LONG REACHING COLD FRONT THAT 
IS PROGGED TO MOVE EAST THROUGH THE TN VLY SUN BRINGING A GOOD 
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ACROSS THE REGION. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIFFER ON 
EASTERN PROGRESSION OF COLD FRONT. THERE IS A CHANCE FRONT COULD 
HANG UP IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH AN INCREASE IN POPS IN 
LATER FORECAST PACKAGES.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH FIRST 
SYSTEM THAT IS PROGGED TO MOVE ON THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON

BOUNDARY INTO AND THROUGH THE AREA BY 18Z TUESDAY AS PER MODELS. FOR 
NOW...WILL WAIT ANOTHER RUN BEFORE COMPLETELY BUYING IN ON GFS MODEL 
DEPICTING A SECOND LINE OF SHRA/TSRA MOVING INTO THE AREA BY 12Z 
WEDNESDAY. NAM MODEL IS SLOWER AND DOESN'T HAVE AS MUCH OF A 
REFLECTION OF THIS SOLUTION. EITHER WAY...TSRA DEVELOPMENT POTENTIAL 
WITH INITIAL SYSTEM IS DEFINITELY POSSIBLE AND CURRENT FORECAST POPS 
IN THE 40-50 PERCENT RANGE FORECAST AREA WIDE LOOKS PRETTY GOOD FOR 
NOW.

STILL WILL BE SLIGHTLY UPPING PRECIP CHANCES FOR EARLY WEDNESDAY

REGION ON WEDNESDAY...WITH AROUND A 60 KNOT JET INDICATED BY MODELS
AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS ACROSS THE AREA INDICATING 0-3 KM HELICITY 
VALUES APPROACHING 850 M2/S2 BY 03Z THURSDAY.

WEB SITE AND IN UPCOMING HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK THIS MORNING TO
ACCOUNT FOR CONTINUED IMPRESSIVE AND EXPECTED SEVERE WEATHER
POTENTIAL ESPECIALLY FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...SPREADING EAST
ACROSS THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING.

UPPER TROF AND SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM INTO THE FORECAST AREA A FEW

.DISCUSSION...
AREA RADARS REVEAL THAT SOME CONVECTION FROM THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
HAS MOVED ONTO THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS MORNING. THIS 
ACTIVITY SHOULD MOSTLY STAY TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY...BUT THINK THAT AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM THIS ACTIVITY 
MAY TRIGGER SOME ADDITIONAL CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...HAVE 
UPDATED THE FORECAST TO MENTION SOME LOW CHANCE POPS AROUND THE 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...INCLUDING SOUTHWEST VA. THE REST OF 
THE FORECAST STILL APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK AND DID NOT CHANGE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH 
A MOIST AND UNSEASONABLY MILD AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A 
BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL REMAIN STAGNANT OVER THE MUCH OF THE 
NATION TODAY AND TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND ITS ASSOCIATED CONVECTION NORTH OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. IN ADDITION...MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A DRY AIR 
MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH TEMPS 
EXPECTED TO BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER TODAY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS ARE COMING CLOSER TO 
AGREEMENT INITIALLY IN KEEPING FIRST FRONTAL BOUNDARY HELD TOGETHER 
AS IT MOVES THROUGH MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND INTO EAST TENNESSEE DURING 
THE DAY ON TUESDAY. WILL UP POPS TO HIGH END OF CHANCE (50 PERCENT) 
FA-WIDE BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO ACCOUNT FOR SOLUTION OF MODELS. 
DECENT AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY...SO WILL KEEP IN CHANCE OF TSRA AREA 
WIDE. 

INITIAL UPPER LOW IS CONTINUED TO BE PROGGED TO MOVE QUICKLY TO THE 
GREAT LAKES REGION BY EARLY WEDNESDAY. A SECOND AND STRONGER UPPER 
LOW AT 500 MILLIBARS CONSISTENTLY HAS BEEN SHOWN BY GFS/NAM/ECMWF TO 
DROP FURTHER SOUTHWARD OUT OF THE ROCKY MOUNTAIN STATES INTO NORTH 
TEXAS AND EASTERN OKLAHOMA BY 06Z WEDNESDAY...AND IS PROGRESSIVELY 
SHOWN TO MOVE THROUGH ARKANSAS THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY BY 00Z 
THURSDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL PUSH A STRONG COLD FRONT LINED UP FROM 
BASICALLY SOUTH TO NORTH ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION 
FROM CVG-BNA-NORTHWEST ALABAMA BY 18Z WEDNESDAY...MOVING INTO 
EASTERN KENTUCKY AND EXTENDING SOUTHWARD THROUGH EAST TENNESSEE BY 
00Z THURSDAY. 

WITH BETTER UPPER DYNAMICS...STRONG COLD ADVECTION AND MODELS
CONSISTENT WITH AT LEAST A 50-60 KNOT LOW LEVEL JET MOVING INTO
EAST TENNESSEE BETWEEN 18Z-00Z TIME PERIOD ON WEDNESDAY...AM MORE 
CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERE THREAT WITH THAT SYSTEM. WILL BE HIGHLIGHTING 
MORE APPARENT SEVERE THREAT IN UPCOMING HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK 
EARLY THIS MORNING FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING FROM WEST TO EAST 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION 
BEHIND THIS STRONG SYSTEM...WITH COOLER TEMPS AND DRY WEATHER 
EXPECTED INTO THE UPCOMING WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CONVECTION REMAINS OVER
NRN PARTS OF KY...MAINLY NORTH OF I-64. OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM THIS
MORNING SEEMS TO HAVE FIZZLED BEFORE REACHING SW VA AND THE NRN
PLATEAU COUNTIES. SPC MESO PAGE SHOWS A CAP HOLDING AND NO MOISTURE
CONVERGENCE...SO WILL CONTINUE A DRY FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. A LOW
STRATUS DECK FORMED LAST NIGHT...BELOW 1000 FEET...BUT NOT AS
LIKELY TONIGHT. ADDED PATCHY VALLEY FOG FOR MURPHY NC (RHP) AND TRI
CITIES (TRI) ZONE GROUPS. MOS BLEND FOR MINS LOOKED GREAT.

OTHERWISE...SURFACE BOUNDARY STAYS TO OUR NORTH THROUGH MONDAY...
ALTHO MOISTURE AND DAYTIME HEATING MONDAY SUPPORTS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
IN HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. I TWEAKED THE TIMING TO JUST AFTERNOON AND
KEPT POPS ONLY AT 20 PERCENT FOR MONDAY. DID NOT STRAY VERY FAR
FROM SIMILAR NAM/GFS MOS TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL 
GRADUALLY MOISTEN ON STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW MONDAY THROUGH THE 
DAYTIME PERIOD WEDNESDAY. INCREASING INSTABILITY THROUGH THIS PERIOD 
WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF ISOLATED CONVECTION ON THE MAJOR 
TERRAIN FEATURES ON MONDAY FOLLOWED BY SCATTERED THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. AMPLIFIED UPPER TROF WILL 
BUILD EAST INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY 00Z THURSDAY WHILE SURFACE 
COLD FRONT PRESSES STEADILY EAST ACROSS TENNESSEE. MAINTAINED LIKELY 
PROBABILITIES FOR STRONG CONVECTION WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHILE KEEPING 
SLIGHT THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS ON THURSDAY WITH 
PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND LIFT WRAPPING AROUND THE DEEP EASTERN U.S. 
UPPER TROF. ON SATURDAY...SLOWLY RISING HEIGHTS AND DRY ADVECTION 
WILL ALLOW FOR PLEASANT WEATHER WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED WARM FRONT OVER THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 
KNOXVILLE AND THE TRI-CITIES...WITH A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THIS WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
MOVE NORTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE...AS A 
BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW STRENGTHENS OVER MUCH OF THE NATION. THIS 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW IS PROGGED TO REMAIN STAGNANT INTO TONIGHT... 
WHICH SHOULD KEEP THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
STATIONARY AND NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. WHILE THE MODELS INDICATE 
THAT MOST OF THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WITH THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL 
REMAIN NORTH OF THE FORECAST REA INTO TONIGHT...MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO 
INDICATE THAT THE MID LEVELS (BETWEEN 850 AND 500 MB) SHOULD BE 
FAIRLY WARM AND STABLE TODAY. THUS...CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE 
SUPPRESSED TODAY OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH MOST OF THE FRONTAL 
CONVECTION REMAINING NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM 
AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY SIMILAR 
AGREEMENT IN KEEPING UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND LIMITING 
SOUTHEAST MOVEMENT OF A FRONTAL BOUNDARY TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. 
GFS/NAM/ECMWF MODELS ALL KEEP COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALONG AND NORTH 
OF THE OHIO RIVER ACROSS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND SOUTHERN INDIANA 
THROUGH 12Z MONDAY.

INITIAL UPPER LOW AT 500 MILLIBARS BY 12Z TUESDAY...SHOWS SIGNS OF
PUSHING NORTHEAST THROUGH THE UPPER PLAINS STATES...AND DRAGS THE
FIRST SYSTEM INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY...BEFORE WEAKENING ACROSS
MIDDLE TENNESSEE. SECOND AND STRONGER UPPER LOW IS THEN PROGGED BY
MODELS TO PUSH SOUTHEAST THROUGH KANSAS TO OKLAHOMA BY 12Z
WEDNESDAY...AND THEN TO SOUTHEAST MISSOURI BY 00Z THURSDAY.

STRONG SURFACE COLD FRONT HAS BEEN SHOWN NOW BY THREE STRAIGHT MODEL 
RUNS TO MOVE QUICKLY FROM THE WEST TO EAST ACROSS WEST TO MIDDLE 
TENNESSEE BY 00Z THURSDAY...AND ON THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 
06-12Z THURSDAY. AM BECOMING MORE CONCERNED ABOUT SEVERE THREAT FOR 
WEDNESDAY EVENING-EARLY THURSDAY TIME PERIOD DUE TO EXPECTED 
INCREASED SEVERE POTENTIAL AND CONSISTENCY OF MODEL RUNS FROM LAST 
NIGHT TO TONIGHT. THIS EVENT WILL BEAR WATCHING CLOSELY OVER THE 
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE EVENT.

CURRENT FORECAST HAS A DECENT HANDLE ON PRECIP CHANCES FOR TUESDAY 
THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY...SO WILL LEAVE ALONE AT THIS TIME.

ACROSS NE TN BETWEEN GCY (GREENEVILLE) AND TRI (TRI CITIES). MCS
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY OVERNIGHT...AND THIS ACTIVITY
SHOULD STAY OUT OF OUR NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES AND SW VA. KEPT IN A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS NE OF THE WARM FRONT THIS EVENING...BUT
DRY AFTERWARDS. WILL LET EVENING SHIFT WATCH MCS TO OUR NORTH...IN
CASE AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MIGHT DRIFT OUR WAY AND PROVIDE A FOCUS
FOR TSRA. OTHER ITEM FOR TONIGHT IS THE POSSIBILITY OF FOG OR LOW
STRATUS CLOUD DECK OVERNIGHT...WITH A WARM AND MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER
WITH LIGHT SOUTH WINDS BEHIND WARM FRONT. 

OTHERWISE...REMOVED LOW POPS FOR NRN MOST AREAS ON SATURDAY. DRY
AND QUITE WARM THROUGH THE WEEKEND. MOS TEMPS CLOSE AND GENERALLY
FOLLOWED...EXCEPT FOR SLIGHTLY FAVORING THE WARMER VALUES.
 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION WILL REMAIN WITHIN THE PROTECTIVE INFLUENCE OF AN AMPLIFIED 
RIDGE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL KEEP CONVECTION 
LIMITED IN SCOPE WITH A SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF DEVELOPMENT ON THE 
MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES. BY TUESDAY...ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES TO MOISTEN 
AND DESTABILIZE AS AN INITIAL SHORT WAVE SHIFTS NORTHEAST FROM THE 
PLAINS THROUGH THE MIDWEST BRINGING A FRONT CLOSE TO THE FORECAST 
AREA. STAYED IN A SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE MODE FOR CONVECTION FOR 
TUESDAY WHILE GRADUALLY INCREASING TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE INITIAL 
WAVE'S COOL FRONT DRAWS NEAR. THE NEXT SHORT WAVE BUILDS EAST INTO 
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY MID DAY WEDNESDAY WITH THE MAIN EVENT 
OCCURRING ACROSS MRX CWFA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS SYSTEM COLD FRONT 
DRIVES EAST TOWARD THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. RATHER STRONG SHORT 
WAVE WITH DECENT INSTABILITY SHOULD RESULT IN STRONG THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. AMPLIFIED UPPER TROF A LITTLE SLOW TO 
DEPART WITH ENOUGH MOISTURE AND ENERGY DROPPING INTO THE BACK SIDE 
OF THE TROF TO KEEP A SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS ON 
THURSDAY. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER GOING THURSDAY NIGHT

.AVIATION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WARM FRONT OVER CENTRAL AL AND 
CENTRAL GA...WITH RADARS SHOWING SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE EASTERN 
SLOPES OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WHICH 
SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS ANY FOG FORMATION THIS MORNING. THIS WARM 
FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY... 
BUT WITH WEAK UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS...SO THINK THAT ONLY SCATTERED 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL DEVELOP. THUS...WILL MENTION VCTS AT KTRI 
AND KTYS FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DAY...SINCE THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
SHOULD BE IN THE VICINITY OF THESE TAF SITES DURING THE PEAK HEATING 
OF THE DAY. HOWEVER...WILL ONLY MENTION CB CLOUDS AT KCHA WHERE 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE MORE SPARSE. OTHERWISE...VFR

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...CONVECTION FINALLY
POPPING OVER SW NC IN THE MAIN AREA OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE THIS
AFTERNOON. OTHER PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA REMAIN GENERALLY STABLE
WITH SOME NEGATIVE BUOYANCY YET TO BE OVERCOME...WITH DEW POINT
TEMPS IN THE 30S AND 40S NOTED OVER SW VA AND NE TN.

THE COLD FRONT HAS STALLED TO OUR SOUTH...AND DEVELOPING MESOSCALE
ACTIVITY ALONG THIS FEATURE IS MAINLY OVER AR AND MS...WITH
MOVEMENT SE. THIS COULD INHIBIT CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT NEAR OUR
REGION OVERNIGHT...THUS I WAS FORCED TO MAKE MAJOR DOWNWARD
ADJUSTMENTS TO OUR POP/WX GRIDS. HOWEVER...AS THE WARM FRONT LIFTS
NORTH OVERNIGHT...ISENTROPIC LIFT IS SHOWN TO DEVELOP OVER MIDDLE
TN AND SPREAD EAST WITH ELEVATED INSTABILITY PROGGED AS WELL.
THIS SEEMS TO LEAD TO BEST RAIN CHANCES BY FRIDAY MORNING AND
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE NRN PLATEAU...NE TN AND SW VA AREAS...SO I
KEPT POPS LIKELY FOR MOST OF THESE AREAS ON FRIDAY. CHANCE POPS
GENERALLY ELSEWHERE.

RAIN CHANCES FALL OFF SHARPLY BY FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE WARM FRONT
LIFTS NE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND MID ATLANTIC STATES. MOSTLY DRY
AND QUITE WARM ON SATURDAY...WITH VERY LITTLE CHANGES MADE TO
PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR BOTH FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.

MOS TEMPS REASONABLY CLOSE AND FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE DOMINANT FLOW 
PATTERN ALOFT WILL BE SOUTHWESTERLY WHICH LEADS TO A WARM EXTENDED 
PERIOD. SHORT WAVELENGTH TROUGH WILL SHIFT NORTHEAST FROM THE PLAINS 
EARLY IN THE WORK WEEK WITH PROGRESS INTO SOUTHEASTERN CANADA BY 12Z 
THURSDAY. DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO THE FORECAST KEEPING A 
NICE WARM AND DRY START TO THE WEEK FOR MOST AREAS. DID KEEP SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ON MONDAY FOR SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH 
CAROLINA WITH GRADUALLY INCREASING CHANCE POPS TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE BIG SHORT WAVE FEATURE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE 
FRONTAL SYSTEM BUILD EAST ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TOWARD THE 
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. POSSIBILITY OF HEALTHY CONVECTIVE EPISODE 
LATER IN THE DAY WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS DEEP MOISTURE IS 
LIFTED AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. TWEAKED TEMPS A BIT ABOVE GUIDANCE 
AS A PLEASANT ABOVE NORMAL PERIOD IS EXPECTED DURING THE EXTENDED

EAST BY ABOUT SUNRISE. KEPT HIGH POPS IN GRIDS BEFORE 12Z. COLD
FRONT ALONG SOUTHERN BORDER HAS BECOME NEARLY STATIONARY AND IS
EXPECTED TO STAY TO THE SOUTH TODAY. HOWEVER SHORTWAVE ENERGY
MOVING ALONG THE FRONT WILL LIKELY FIRE NEW CONVECTION TO THE WEST
IN AR OR MS AND MOVE INTO SE TN THIS AFTERNOON. CHANCE POPS
SOUTHERN HALF TO NO POPS NORTHEAST AS DRIER COOLER AIR MASS WILL
PREVAIL THERE AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER OH VALLEY SINKS A LITTLE
FARTHER SOUTH AND EAST. TONIGHT MOISTURE SURGES BACK NORTH WITH
STATIONARY FRONT TO THE SOUTH BEGINNING TO MOVE BACK NORTH. RAIN

ALONG SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT COMBINING WITH THE ELEVATED

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...MAIN FOCUS FOR EVENING 
CONVECTION WILL BE THE COLD FRONT...WHICH BASED ON LATEST SURFACE 
MAP WAS LOCATED ROUGHLY FROM NRN AL TO JUST EAST OF CSV AND TO NEAR 
LOZ. IN SPITE OF LIMITED SUNSHINE...AIRMASS HAS BECOME UNSTABLE OVER 
CENTRAL/SE TN INTO SW NC. BEST LOW LEVEL MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IS A 
BIT FURTHER SOUTH FROM NE AL INTO EXTREME SE TN...NRN GA AND SW TIP 
OF NC. NEW DEVELOPMENT IS VERY LIMITED THIS AFTERNOON...SUCH THAT MY 
PRE FIRST PERIOD POPS REQUIRED A SIGNIFICANT DECREASE.

EXPECTING COLD FRONT TO HAVE DROPPED SE OF NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA BY 
21/00Z...SO RUNNING THOSE AREAS DRY FOR TONIGHT. SLIGHT CHANCE TO 
CHANCE POPS SOUTH LOOKS GOOD FOR REMAINDER OF FORECAST AREA. DRIER 
AIR WORKING IN BEHIND THE FRONT...BUT I FAVORED A SLIGHT BLEND WHERE 
MOS MINS WERE DIFFERENT.

RAIN CHANCES RETURN BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...BUT MAINLY OVER SRN 
AREAS...IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. MORE CLOUDINESS ACROSS 
SRN AREAS...SO DID NOT GO TOTALLY WITH THE WARMER HIGHS FOR 
THURSDAY. ADJUSTED PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID TO BLEND BETTER WITH 
NEARBY NWS GRIDS.    


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...TROUGH TRACKING 
THROUGH THE AREA ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY..WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST 
CHANCES IN THE NORTH WHERE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT IS EXPECTED.  
MOISTURE LINGERING INTO SATURDAY...WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN 
THE NORTH AGAIN.  SHORTWAVE FOLLOWING ON SUNDAY MOST OF THE AREA 
SHOULD BE DRY..BUT WILL KEEP LOW POPS FOR THE NORTHERN AREAS. SHOULD

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID MS 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH A LINE OF STRONG CONVECTION DEVELOPING AHEAD OF 
ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. THIS CONVECTION IS ALREADY CONGEALING 
INTO A SQUALL LINE...WHICH WILL LIKELY QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY LATER TONIGHT (MOST LIKELY FASTER THAN WHAT THE MODELS 
SUGGEST). WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING AND THE UPPER-LEVEL 
DYNAMICS MOVING NORTHEAST TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES REGION...THINK 
THAT THIS SQUALL LINE SHOULD WEAKEN LATER TONIGHT AS IT APPROACHES 
THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...MODELS STILL INDICATE SOME MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA TOWARDS SUNRISE...SO 
THINK THAT SOME DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL AND LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE WITH SOME STORMS BEFORE THEY TOTALLY 
FALL APART AGAINST THE MOUNTAINS. 

WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS 
EVENING TO MENTION LIKELY POPS LATER TONIGHT...AND TO MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SOME SEVERE STORMS. OTHERWISE...REST OF THE FORECAST 
APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...MORE ACTIVE WEATHER IN STORE 
IN THE SHORT TERM AS COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA FROM 
THE WEST OVERNIGHT. MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW MODERATE INSTABILITY 
PERSISTING OVERNIGHT...ALTHOUGH DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM NOT AS 
IMPRESSIVE AS THE LAST FEW PREDECESSORS. NEVERTHELESS...CANNOT RULE 
OUT A LEAST A FEW STORMS APPROACHING SEVERE LIMITS WITH THIS SYSTEM. 
HAVE GRADATED POPS FROM WEST TO EAST LATE IN THE FIRST PERIOD AS 
FRONT APPROACHES. SURFACE FRONT BOGS DOWN NEAR OUR SOUTHERN TIER 
KEEPING HIGHER CHANCE POPS THERE TOMORROW. ADDITIONALLY...WINDS MAY 
APPROACH ADVISORY CRITERIA IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN OVERNIGHT...BUT 
VALUES MARGINAL AND INCLINATION IS TO NOT ISSUE ANY WIND PRODUCTS 
AT THIS TIME. FOR TEMPS...MAV/MET GUIDANCE CLOSE AND APPEARS 
REASONABLE. GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM THOSE VALUES.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL
PUSH SOUTH INTO THE NORTHERN GULF COAST STATES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
THURSDAY. SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE CLOSE
ENOUGH TO THE FRONT TO CONTINUE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. SURFACE RIDGE WILL WEDGE SOUTH EAST OF THE
APPALACHIANS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WITH BROKEN STRATO-CU
EXPECTED FOR THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND PLATEAU FRIDAY MORNING. OTHERWISE...
INCREASING SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL HELP PULL FRONT BACK NORTH ACROSS
THE AREA THROUGH FRIDAY PRODUCING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...RIDGE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT ACROSS
THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL KEEP FRONT BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO
VALLEY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. FRONTAL BOUNDARY CLOSE ENOUGH TO
KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE-CHANCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE
NORTHERN SECTIONS.

FOR TUESDAY...RIDGING WILL WEAKEN ALLOWING FOR INCREASING MOISTURE
AND BETTER CHANCES OF STORMS.

CHANGES PLANNED AT THIS TIME. SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION REMAINS
IN INCREASINGLY ANTI-CYCLONIC SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AROUND UPPER
RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS...WITH TEMPS PROJECTED TO CLIMB
TO WELL ABOVE CLIMO. MAIN ISSUE FOR TODAY APPEARS TO BE SKY COVER
AS SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUDS REMAIN OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS
MORNING. HOWEVER...ANTICIPATE THESE CLOUDS WILL TEND TO GRADUALLY
SCATTER OUT AS BETTER MIXING COMMENCES THIS AFTERNOON. FORECAST
SOUNDINGS ALSO DEPICT MODERATE INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON...
ALTHOUGH MOISTURE PROFILE IS UNIMPRESSIVE. THUS PROBABLY CANNOT
COMPLETELY RULE OUT ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING IN SOME OF THE
HIGHEST TERRAIN. CURRENT FORECAST DEPICTS THIS OVERALL SCENARIO
WELL AND NO CHANGES ARE WARRANTED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CAP AROUND 6500 FEET EARLY THIS 
MORNING. CLOUDS WILL LINGER UNTIL CAP BREAKS OUT DURING THE MORNING 
HOURS. WARM AIR ADVECTION REMAINS STRONG THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL TODAY AND TONIGHT INCLUDING THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ISOLATED BRIEF DURATION CONVECTION POSSIBLE 
ACROSS SW VA AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF E TN BUT MOST AREAS 
WILL REMAIN DRY. ONGOING CONVECTION WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS MIDDLE TN 
TONIGHT. THIS ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY INCREASE IN ITS EASTWARD 
PROGRESSION LATE TONIGHT AS STEERING FLOW VEERS AND INCREASES IN 
STRENGTH. TSTM ACTIVITY SHOULD REACH THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AROUND 5 
AM EDT (4 AM CDT). SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE WITH THE MAIN 
THREAT BEING DAMAGING WINDS.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...FRONTAL SYSTEM PLOWING
INTO AREA WEDNESDAY...THEN SLOWLY SETTLING IN OR NEAR SOUTHERN
PARTS OF CWA UNTIL FRIDAY WHEN IT LIFTS NORTHWARD. WITH FRONTAL
BOUNDARY CLOSER TO THE SOUTHERN AREAS...POPS WILL TREND HIGHER IN
THE SOUTH.

THEN MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH SWELLING MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGE NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF THAT WILL TEND TO DIVERT MOST ACTIVE 
WEATHER OFF TO OUR NORTH FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD 
AND KEEP THE FRONTAL BOUNDARIES TO THE NORTH.  HOWEVER...THE RIDGE 
IS NOT EXPECTED TO DOMINATE THE SCENE THIS FAR NORTH...SO AM LEAVING 
SOME LIGHT TO MODERATE POPS IN...WITH GENERALLY A LOWER TO HIGHER 
GRADIENT OF POPS SOUTH TO NORTH...FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY.  

FOR TEMPS...HAVE COOLED OFF MAX TEMPS IN SOUTHERN AREAS FOR FIRST 
COUPLE OF DAYS DUE TO EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER...BUT HAVE BUMPED UP MAX 
TEMPS FOR THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS...AS RIDGE KEEPS WARM AIR IN 
PLACE...LOOKS LIKE MOS MAXES WERE TRENDING BACK TOWARD CLIMO TOWARD 
THE END OF THE GUIDANCE.  WENT VERY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON MIN TEMPS.

SEVERE THREAT FOR WEDNESDAY SEEMS LIKE IT WILL BE ON THE LOW END 
OVERALL...WOULD EXPECT TREND TO BE DOWNWARD AS OVERNIGHT CONVECTION 
PUSHES FARTHER INTO AREA. SLIGHT CHANCE THAT FRONT WILL BE SLOW 
ENOUGH TO ALLOW BUILD-UP AGAIN WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON ALONG FRONT...BUT 
ONLY SOMETHING TO KEEP AN EYE ON AT THIS POINT.  WOULD EXPECT MAIN 
FOCUS TO BE FARTHER SOUTH OR EAST.

REMAINS POOR FOR THIS PERIOD AND CONFIDENCE ON DETAILS IS LOW.  
INTRODUCED A FEW LOW POPS OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON TUESDAY AS A 
BOUNDARY SETTLES IN TO OUR NORTH.  MODELS DO SHOW SOME TRENDING 
TOWARDS A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY FOR OUR BEST CHANCE 
OF CONVECTION.  THIS FRONT SHOULD SETTLE TO OUR SOUTH ON THURSDAY

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT ALONG THE CAROLINA 
COAST...WITH A WEAK TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AREA RADARS CONTINUE TO REVEAL A FEW LIGHT 
SHOWERS OVER EASTERN KY AND SOUTHWEST VA...BUT THESE SHOWERS SHOULD 
DIMINISH SHORTLY AFTER THEIR ASSOCIATED UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE EXITS 
THE REGION. HIGH PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO BUILD ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY TONIGHT...BRINGING AN UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR MASS INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS 
OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WHICH SHOULD BEGIN TO DECREASE FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST AFTER MIDNIGHT. ALTHOUGH TEMPS SHOULD FALL INTO THE 30S IN 
MANY AREAS BY SUNRISE...A PERSISTENT WIND FLOW SHOULD PREVENT ANY 
FROST FORMATION.

WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE FORECAST THIS EVENING 
TO REMOVE THE WIND ADVISORY HEADLINE...AND TO MENTION DECREASING 
CLOUDINESS IN MOST AREAS. TEMPS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK AND WILL NOT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL PULL OUT OF 
THE REGION...AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. PRESSURE GRADIENT 
WILL RELAX THIS EVENING...ALLOWING STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS TO 
DIMINISH.  WILL ALLOW WIND ADVISORY TO CONTINUE THROUGH 01Z.  CLOUDS 
WILL DIMINISH FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST TONIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY.  MAY 
BE A SHOWER NORTHERN HALF EARLY TONIGHT...SO WILL CARRY LOW POP 
THROUGH MIDNIGHT THERE. TEMPS WILL DIP INTO THE 30S IN MANY 
LOCATIONS...BUT WITH THE EXPECTED WIND/CLOUDS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE 
MUCH OF A THREAT FOR FROST.  SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL 
LIKELY DIP BELOW FREEZING...BUT AT THIS TIME DO NOT THINK IT 
WARRANTS A FREEZE WARNING.  JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS.  


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...EARLY PART OF THE
UPCOMING WORK WEEK CONTINUES TO LOOK DRY WITH TEMPS MODERATING TO
BACK ABOVE CLIMO PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. LATTER PORTIONS
OF THE LONG TERM MORE PROBLEMATIC HOWEVER AS MODEL SOLUTIONS
DIVERGE. THE ECMWF MODEL HAS BEEN CONSISTENT WITH BRINGING A WEST-
EAST ORIENTED SURFACE BOUNDARY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION
BY WEDNESDAY AND STALLING THE BOUNDARY OVER OUR GENERAL AREA ALONG
WITH ACCOMPANYING PRECIP. THE GFS HAS BEEN LESS CONSISTENT WITH
THIS BOUNDARY...NOW DEPICTING THAT IT WILL PUSH WELL SOUTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA FOR A TIME BEFORE RETURNING AS A WARM FRONT LATER IN
THE WEEK. EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN LESS CONSISTENT...THE GFS HAS
SUPPORT FROM THE GEFS ENSEMBLES AND THE CANADIAN MODEL. DUE TO THE
LOW CONFIDENCE...DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/
FORECAST FOR THOSE TIME PERIOD. DID HOWEVER REMOVE POPS FOR TUESDAY
AS MODELS HAVE BEEN TRENDING DRIER AND ARE NOW IN GENERAL AGREEMENT
WITH DRY CONDITIONS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED A BLEND OF
MAV/MET GUIDANCE FOR EARLY IN THE LONG TERM..AND DID NOT DEVIATE
MUCH FROM THE MEX GUIDANCE FOR THE LATTER PORTION OF THE LONG TERM.

.DISCUSSION...CURRENT FORECAST IN GOOD SHAPE AS MASS OF SHOWERS
WITH EMBEDDED THUNDER CONTINUES TO MAKE EASTWARD PROGRESS ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA. APPEARS THAT DEEP SOUTHERN CONVECTION IS ROBBING
A PORTION OF THE GULF INFLOW INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIAN REGION.
ATMOSPHERE HAS BEEN VERY SLOW TO DESTABILIZE WITH LARGE AREA OF
RAIN COOLED AIR ACROSS MIDDLE AND EASTERN TENNESSEE. SATELLITE AND
RADAR IMAGERY REVEAL STRONGER LIFT WITH LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS JUST
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT ACROSS WESTERN KENTUCKY/TENNESSEE. THIS
AREA WILL MOST LIKELY WEAKEN TO SOME DEGREE AS IT MOVES INTO THE
FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THERE STILL MAY BE A STRONG
THUNDERSTORM IN THE LINE AND CONVECTION SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP SOME
GUSTY WIND GOING...SO WILL KEEP THE WIND PRODUCTS GOING OVERNIGHT.
WILL TWEAK SOME TEMPERATURE AND DEWPOINT FIELDS TO MATCH CURRENT
WEATHER.

THE MIDWEST. MASS OF SHOWERS WITH A SMALLER AREA OF THUNDERSTORMS
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA CURRENTLY
MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. RAIN COOLED AREA ACROSS MUCH OF

ACROSS THE TAF SITES WITH A SMALL THREAT OF THUNDER. IT WILL TAKE A
LONG TIME FOR THE MAIN FRONTAL BAND OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS TO PROGRESS EAST ACROSS THE TAF SITES TONIGHT AND
THERE WILL STILL BE SOME SHOWERS OCCURRING FOR A PERIOD AT TRI
AFTER 12Z. DRY SLOT COULD ALLOW SKIES TO GO PARTLY CLOUDY DURING

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...CONVECTION HAS DIMINISHED 
THIS AFTERNOON AS IT HAS MOVED INTO OUR AREA...LEAVING MOSTLY 
SHOWERS AS INSTABILITY IS LACKING.  HOWEVER...EXPECT ADDITIONAL 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF APPROACHING COLD 
FRONT...AND INSTABILITY SHOULD BE A LITTLE BETTER THIS 
EVENING/OVERNIGHT SO WITH STRONG WIND FIELDS AND SIGNIFICANT 
FORCING...STILL COULD BE SOME SEVERE STORMS ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND 
WEST ZONES.  LOW LEVEL JET STRENGTHENS EVEN MORE OVERNIGHT...AS DOES 
POTENTIAL FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES.  HAVE ALREADY SEEN WARNING LEVEL WINDS 
AT TIMES IN SOME OF THE NORMAL RISK AREAS...SO HIGH WIND WARNING 
LOOKS GOOD.  WHILE MANY VALLEY LOCATIONS MAY NOT SEE ADVISORY LEVEL 
WINDS OVERNIGHT...ENOUGH RISK FOR GUSTS TO 40 TO KEEP WIND ADVISORY 
GOING...AND WILL EXTEND TO 12Z TO MATCH WARNING.  PRECIP SHOULD 
RAPIDLY MOVE OUT EARLY SATURDAY...BUT MAY BE A FEW LINGERING 
SHOWERS.   WILL STILL BE ON THE WINDY SIDE SATURDAY...AND MAY NEED A 
WIND ADVISORY FOR AT LEAST PARTS OF THE AREA...BUT WILL HOLD OFF FOR 
NOW AND LET LATER SHIFTS TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH THE LONG TERM BUT DETAILS ARE STILL 
SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN. OTHER THAN A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS SATURDAY 
NIGHT IN THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES AND HIGHER TERRAIN...EARLY PORTION 
OF LONG TERM APPEARS GENERALLY DRY WITH TEMPS SLOWLY MODERATING TO 
ABOVE CLIMO. SURFACE BOUNDARY APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA AND THEN 
STILL OVER THE AREA BY MID WORK WEEK WITH ACCOMPANYING MOISTURE AND 
SCATTERED PRECIP. APPEARS THINGS WILL REMAIN UNSETTLED WITH BOUNDARY 
MEANDERING AROUND THE AREA THROUGH THE LATTER PORTION OF THE LONG 
TERM. THUS HAVE CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE PERIODS EVEN THOUGH PRECIP IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE 
CONTINUOUS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE APPRECIABLY FROM

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE 
NE THROUGH MO TODAY AND CONTINUES TO MOVE NE TONIGHT. GOOD DIVERGENCE SETS 
UP ALOFT OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY LOW 
LEVEL JET OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TODAY SHIFTS INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS OVERNIGHT. VERY STRONG THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY EXPECTED 
TODAY SW OF THE MRX CWA. THIS ACTIVITY WILL APPROACH THE AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON AND MOVE INTO THE MRX CWA THIS EVENING. VERTICAL WIND 
PROFILES REMAIN MODERATELY STRONG THIS EVENING. THE AIRMASS SHOULD 
STABILIZE SOME PRIOR TO THE ONSET OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. 
HOWEVER STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED THIS EVENING. 
DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT. A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EAST 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. WINDS WILL DECREASE MOST 
LOCATIONS SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT BUT REMAIN STRONG IN THE MOUNTAINS 
OVERNIGHT. COLD AIR ADVECTION NOT VERY STRONG BEHIND FRONT. SHOWERS 
WILL CONTINUE EARLY SATURDAY AND PERSIST MUCH OF THE DAY ACROSS SW 
VA AND NE TN MNTS. TEMPERATURES WILL COOL TO A FEW DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL SATURDAY. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS WILL 
LINGER OVER NORTHERN AREAS AS WRAP AROUND SHOWERS PULL AWAY FROM THE 
REGION SATURDAY NIGHT.  SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN FOR SUNDAY AND BEGINS 
TO SHIFT EASTWARD ON MONDAY.  A WEAK BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH AND MOIST 
SOUTHERLY FLOW MAY GENERATE A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS THE MRX CWA MONDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT.  A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED INTO THE AREA 
AROUND THE WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY TIME FRAME...PROVIDING OUR BEST CHANCE 
OF CONVECTION FOR THE EXTENDED.  AS FOR TEMPERATURES...GUIDANCE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
249 PM EDT THU APR 14 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT FOR 
THE SHORT TERM AS HIGH PRESSURE RETREATS AND LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM/COLD 
FRONT APPROACHES.  PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN...AND LOW LEVEL JET 
WILL STRENGTHEN FROM THE SOUTHEAST.  LOOKS LIKE CONDITIONS WILL 
START TO BECOME FAVORABLE FOR A MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT LATE FRIDAY...SO 
HIGH WIND WATCH WILL CONTINUE.  DOWNSLOPING LIKELY WILL DELAY PRECIP 
ARRIVAL FOR CENTRAL/NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS.  WILL UNDERCUT MAV POPS 
ESPECIALLY DOWNSLOPE AREAS...AND WILL ALSO GO ABOVE MAV TEMPS IN 
THESE LOCATIONS FOR FRIDAY.  WILL ONLY MENTION THUNDER IN SOUTHERN 
AND WESTERN ZONES AS INSTABILITY LOOKS MINIMAL FURTHER NORTHEAST AND 
DOWNSLOPING SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS CONVECTION. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE 
LONG TERM IS THE STRONG SYSTEM THAT AFFECTS THE FORECAST AREA IN THE 
LATE FRIDAY TO EARLY SATURDAY TIME FRAME. LATEST MODEL FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS DEPICT GENERALLY UNIMPRESSIVE INSTABILITY BUT VERY STRONG 
VERTICAL WIND PROFILE. THIS SETUP APPEARS SIMILAR TO THIS PAST 
MONDAY EVENING'S EVENT ONLY WITH EVEN STRONGER WIND PROFILE. THUS 
SOME SEVERE WEATHER POSSIBLE...ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN ZONES AND 
PLATEAU AREA...ALTHOUGH LATE EVENING TO EARLY MORNING TIMING LESS 
FAVORABLE FOR THAT ASPECT. STRONG SURFACE WINDS ALSO A CONCERN AS 
FAVORABLE PROFILE FOR MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT SETS UP OVER THE FAVORED 
AREAS WITH 70+ KNOT LLJ...VEERING WIND PROFILE AND ELEVATED STABLE 
LAYER AROUND 850 MB PROJECTED. THUS WILL CONTINUE HIGH WIND WATCH 
THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.

OTHERWISE...SYSTEM PULLS OUT ON SATURDAY BUT LINGERING WRAP-AROUND 
MOISTURE WILL KEEP PRECIP POSSIBLE THROUGH THE DAY BEFORE TAPERING 
OFF SATURDAY NIGHT. AFTER A BRIEF RESPITE...A WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY 
WILL MEANDER AROUND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION RESULTING IN LOW 
CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WORK WEEK. FOR TEMPS... 
GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO MAV/MEX GUIDANCE AS ENSEMBLES DISPLAYED NO 
DISCERNIBLE TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ANOTHER GREAT DAY IS IN STORE 
AS ZONAL FLOW ALOFT SPREADS A BIT OF CI ACROSS THE REGION WITH A 
SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF EARLY SPRING SUNSHINE. LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW IN 
COMBINATION WITH INSOLATION SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RISE A FEW 
DEGREES ABOVE WEDNESDAY MAXES. MOISTURE WILL BE ON THE INCREASE 
LATER TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL LOW MAKES ITS WAY FROM 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE OZARKS BY LATE AFTERNOON FRIDAY. SURFACE 
LOW PRESSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE RATHER DEEP PARENT SYSTEM WILL PULL 
INCREASING MOISTURE OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO. SHOWERS WILL BECOME 
LIKELY ACROSS MUCH OF THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING 
THE DAY AS A WARM FRONT BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
INSTABILITY WILL INCREASE LEADING TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
THUNDERSTORMS...ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. STAYED CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE TEMP BLEND FOR THE SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A STRONG UPPER 
TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY. A COLD FRONT WILL SWEEPS EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
FRIDAY NIGHT-EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...A STRONG 
BOUNDARY LAYER JET (850MB WINDS OF 65KTS+) WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. GOOD SETUP FOR DOWNSLOPE MOUNTAIN WAVE WINDS IN 
THE ADJACENT FOOTHILLS...SUCH AS THE CAMP CREEK AREA. WINDS OF 70-80 
MPH WINDS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THESE AREAS...SO HAVE ISSUED A HIGH 
WIND WATCH FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...BEGINNING AT 21Z FRIDAY.

A SQUALL LINE OF STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WILL MOVE INTO THE PLATEAU 
COUNTIES FRIDAY EVENING. MODELS SHOW WEDGE OF INSTABILITY PULLING UP 
INTO THE PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA. ALSO...STRONG SHEAR-HIGH HELICLITIES AS WELL WITH 
SIGNIFICANT TORNADO PARAMETERS FAVORABLE FOR TORNADOES. FOR THE REST 
OF THE AREA...MAIN CONCERN WILL BE DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS WITH 
THE LINE OF STORMS.

FOR SATURDAY...FRONT WILL MOVE EAST EARLY WITH A GOOD DEAL OF COLD 
AIR STRATO-CU ANTICIPATED AND AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN...ESPECIALLY FOR 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA AND MOUNTAINS.

FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...RIDGING WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH DRIER CONDITIONS AND MORE SEASONAL TEMPERATURES.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...SURFACE HIGH WILL BE EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS WITH DEVELOPING SOUTHERLY WINDS PULLING MOISTURE AND 
WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE REGION. ISENTROPIC LIFT AND INCREASING 
INSTABILITY WILL PRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ALMOST EACH DAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)..SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
AREA WILL SHIFT EAST AS UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES OVER THE REGION.  
SHOULD SEE SOME HIGH CLOUDS AROUND AT TIMES...BUT STILL MAINLY CLEAR 
THROUGH THE PERIOD.  TEMPS TONIGHT MAY GET LOW ENOUGH FOR SOME 
FROST...ESPECIALLY NORTHERN AREAS.  WILL ISSUE A FROST ADVISORY FOR

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE SHIFTS 
EAST THURSDAY NIGHT WITH WINDS ALOFT INCREASING FROM THE SOUTHEAST 
AS LOW PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
MOVES EAST TOWARD THE MS VALLEY. SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR TO 
PARTLY CLOUDY BUT LOWS ABOUT 10 DEGREES WARMER THAN TONIGHTS LOWS.
BIG CHANGES FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS NEGATIVELY TILTED UPPER LOW 
DEVELOPS OVER MID MS VALLEY AND MOVES SLOWLY NE INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
BY SATURDAY. THE SURFACE LOW IS EXPECTED TO MOVE FROM MO FRIDAY 
MORNING INTO MI BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. STRONG WINDS ALOFT AND 
DESTABILIZATION OF THE ATMOSPHERE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT WILL CAUSE 
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE DURING THE DAY WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
INCREASING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY ACROSS THE WESTERN SECTIONS WILL 
ALLOW POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS THERE IN THE AFTERNOON. THE BEST CHANCE 
FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LOOKS LIKE FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH SATURDAY

AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA TODAY BUT NOT BEFORE GENERATING BKN-SCT 
SC ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS 
WELL AS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. AS 
USUAL DIFFICULT TO SAY WHEN THE CLOUDS WILL BREAK BUT SATELLITE 
IMAGERY INDICATES THAT THE CLOUDS MAY NOT PERSIST TOO LONG AFTER 
DAYBREAK. THAT WOULD ALLOW FOR A RETURN TO NEARLY FULL SUNSHINE FOR 
THE ENTIRE AREA AS THE ONLY OTHER MOISTURE TO SPEAK OF WILL BE THIN 
CIRRUS CLOUDS BUILDING IN FROM THE MIDWEST OVER THE TOP OF A LOW 
AMPLITUDE UPPER RIDGE. TONIGHT CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHTER WIND WILL 
PRODUCE RATHER DECENT LONG WAVE RADIATION WITH TEMPS DROPPING INTO 
THE MID AND UPPER 30S ACROSS THE NORTH AND MOUNTAINS WHERE THERE 
COULD BE SOME PATCHY FROST FORMATION. ANOTHER GREAT DAY IN STORE ON 
THURSDAY WITH MORE SUNSHINE AS HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY DEPARTS WHILE 
THE REGION AWAITS THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER STRONG STORM SYSTEM FOR THE 
EARLY PART OF THE WEEKEND. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE WILL MOVE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS THURSDAY NIGHT WITH
RETURN OF GULF MOISTURE MOVING NORTH ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES
TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
MID-SECTION OF THE NATION WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVING INTO
THE WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE FRIDAY...THEN ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. A BAND OF CONVECTION WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION
FRIDAY NIGHT. INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED...SO DO NOT EXPECT SEVERE
STORMS WITH THIS LINE. 

FOR SATURDAY...UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH A
GOOD DEAL OF COLD AIR STRATO-CU AND PERIODS OF LIGHT RAIN...
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA.

FOR SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...ANOTHER RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESS WILL BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA.

FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...SURFACE RIDGING WILL BE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS
WITH WARM SOUTHERLY WINDS INCREASING TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE 70S

MODELS SHOW A DEFORMATION ZONE MOVING ACROSS KENTUCKY AND WESTERN-
MIDDLE TENNESSEE EARLY THIS MORNING...THEN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
THIS MORNING-EARLY AFTERNOON. RADAR SHOWS AN AREA OF SHOWERS
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LIFT. THE DEFORMATION ZONE COMBINED WITH WEAK
INSTABILITY WILL PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN TWO-
THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA...MAINLY THIS MORNING.

AS UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST...BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW WILL BECOME 
NORTHWESTERLY PRODUCING UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
THROUGH THIS EVENING.

PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL CLOUDS REMAIN OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...
EXCEPT SOUTHERN COUNTIES...TODAY...THEN SLOWLY ERODE OVERNIGHT FROM 
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST.

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY. AREAS OF FROST IS POSSIBLE FOR THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...FAR EASTERN 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS...AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WEDNESDAY NIGHT-
THURSDAY MORNING.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN 
AGREEMENT FOR THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST...ESPECIALLY BY 
SUNDAY/MONDAY BUT WENT A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE ECMWF DEPICTION FOR 
THE LONG TERM. TRIED TO SLOW DOWN THE INTRODUCTION OF POPS TO SOME 
DEGREE THURSDAY NIGHT AS MODEL FORECASTS BRING ANOTHER UPPER LOW 
THROUGH THE PLAINS TOWARD THE MIDWEST STATES. ECMWF WAS SLOWER THAN 
THE GFS/CANADIAN AND KEPT THURSDAY NIGHT MOSTLY DRY AS SYSTEM WARM 
FRONT TRIES TO MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THE WARMER AIR 
RETURNS DURING THE DAY FRIDAY ALONG WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY SO KEPT THE MEDIUM CHANCE POPS GOING WHILE USING A 
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST GRADIENT IN POP AWAITING THE MAIN EVENT 
FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE SYSTEM COLD FRONT BUILDS INTO THE REGION. 
INCREASED POP TO LIKELY CATEGORY FOR THE NIGHT TIME CONVECTION. 
SLOWED DOWN THE DEPARTURE OF POST FRONTAL SHOWERS ON SATURDAY AS THE 
UPPER LOW/TROF SHIFTS SLOWLY NORTHEAST INTO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES 
AND UPPER OHIO VALLEY. DUE TO MODEL UNCERTAINTY DURING THE LAST 
COUPLE DAYS OF THE EXTENDED...DID NOT MAKE CHANGES TO THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED WARM FRONT STRETCHING 
ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND THEN GENERALLY ALONG THE 
SPINE OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND MOIST 
AIR MASS WAS IN PLACE OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH TEMPS IN THE 80S 
OVER MOST AREAS. AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY WILL 
MOVE EAST TONIGHT...WITH A STRONG COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY ON MONDAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT CONVECTION 
AHEAD OF THIS FRONT WILL AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA MAINLY DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. WHILE INSTABILITY IS PROGGED TO BE 
MARGINAL AHEAD OF THE FRONT...A STRONG VEERING WIND FIELD ALONG WITH 
AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SHOULD COMBINE TO PRODUCE ANOTHER 
ROUND OF SEVERE WEATHER. GFS AND NAM MODELS ARE ALSO IN AGREEMENT 
THAT SOUTHWESTERLY 850 MB WINDS WILL BRING A GOOD FETCH OF GULF 
MOISTURE...SO WILL MENTION 'RAIN MAY BE HEAVY AT TIMES' WORDING IN 
THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH 
TUESDAY AND LOOK REASONABLE. FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...WILL TREND TOWARDS 
A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR 
A QUIET WEATHER PATTERN WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. MAIN CONCERN THIS 
EXTENDED WILL BE A COLD FRONT THAT PUSHES INTO THE REGION FOR FRIDAY 
AND FRIDAY NIGHT. ASSOCIATED UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH WILL CONTINUE TO 
ROTATE IN SCATTERED SHOWERS INTO SATURDAY...WITH BEST CHANCE OF POPS 
OVER NORTHERN AREAS. CONTINUE WARM FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED...THOUGH

AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
HOURS. MODELS ALSO AGREE THAT INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK AHEAD OF THIS 
COLD FRONT...BUT STILL THINK SOME SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE 
WITH A STRONG WIND FIELD EXPECTED ALONG WITH AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
EXTENDING FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND THEN 
SOUTHEAST OVER SOUTHERN WV AND NORTHWEST NC...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY 
WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY 
REVEALS THAT A STRONG MCS HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE LOWER OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY...AND WAS 
INTENSIFYING AS IT MOVED EAST. THICKNESS VALUES...ALONG WITH THE 
ORIENTATION OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND EXPECTED INSTABILITY AXIS... 
SUGGESTS THAT THIS CONVECTIVE COMPLEX WILL BEGIN TO MOVE SOUTHEAST 
BY THIS AFTERNOON. WITH THIS CONVECTIVE COMPLEX EXPECTED TO MOVE 
THROUGH AT LEAST THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS...AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE WEATHER WILL 
LIKELY DEVELOP SINCE MODELS INDICATE THAT INSTABILITY LEVELS SHOULD 
BECOME MODERATELY STRONG TO POSSIBLY VERY STRONG THIS AFTERNOON.

WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE FORECAST THIS 
MORNING TO EMPHASIZE THE SEVERE POSSIBILITIES THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
TO TWEAK TEMPS UPWARDS LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

258 AM EDT THU APR 7 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK RIDGE ALOFT WILL REMAIN
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. FAST WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL ALLOW HIGH LEVEL
CIRRO-STRATUS TODAY...AND SOME ALTO-STRATUS TONIGHT TO MOVE ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA. DEWPOINTS WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY LOW (30S-40S)
SINCE SURFACE RIDGING REMAINS OVER THE EASTERN GULF THROUGH THE
FORECAST PERIOD. LOW AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITIES IN THE MID 20S
TO NEAR 30 EXPECTED TODAY.

INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT LATE TONIGHT MAY PRODUCE ISOLATED-WIDELY
SCATTERED SHOWERS...BUT MOST LOCATIONS WILL REMAIN DRY.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CAPPING INVERSION SHOWN
TO WEAKEN ON FRIDAY WITH LAPSE RATES STEEPENING BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
LEADING TO POSTIVE CAPE OF GREATER THAN 1000 J/KG. FRONTAL BOUNDARY
SHOWN TO STALL JUST TO OUR NORTH ACROSS ERN KY AND SW VA...WITH
FLOW ALOFT PUSHING MOST STORMS IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION. HOWEVER...
FURTHER SOUTH ACROSS SRN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA I DON'T SEE AS
MUCH FOCUS FOR CONVECTION. INCREASED POPS TO AROUND 60 PERCENT OVER
NE AREAS...BUT KEPT A MUCH LOWER CHANCE POP ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC.

STILL UNSTABLE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...BUT SLIGHT
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION LOOKS GOOD FOR
NOW. KEEPING SUNDAY DRY AND QUITE WARM...IN FACT LIKELY THE WARMEST
DAY OF THE YEAR FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

TIMING FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY SYSTEM WITH APPROACHING COLD
FRONT...STILL A BIT TRICKY AS ECMWF IS NOW MUCH SLOWER THAN GFS/NAM
SOLUTIONS. THUS...OPTED TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS
FOR THIS SYSTEM. TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY SHAPE UP TO BE DRY WITH
TEMPS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE CLIMO.

230 PM EDT WED APR 6 2011

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST... 
WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND MID WEST. 
THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...AND THEN SLOWLY DRIFT 
INTO SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN BY FRIDAY NIGHT. A SOUTHERLY WIND 
FLOW WILL CONTINUE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT...BRINGING WARMER TEMPS EACH SUCCESSIVE DAY ALONG WITH 
INCREASING LEVELS OF MOISTURE. MODELS AGREE THAT SOME MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AS THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY...SO WILL INCLUDE A 
CHANCE FOR TSTORMS ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS 
AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT 
WITH MAXES...BUT REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS. WILL GENERALLY 
TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE WITH MINS THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS FAIRLY SIMILAR WITH 
LONG TERM DETAILS THROUGH SUNDAY BUT THEN DIVERGE DURING THE REST OF 
THE FORECAST. KEPT SLIGHT AND SMALL CHANCE POPS FOR A SHOWER AND 
POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM ON SATURDAY AS A WARM FRONT ADVANCES 
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. UPPER HEIGHTS AMPLIFY 
NICELY ON SUNDAY WITH MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA IN THE WARM SECTOR 
FROM MID TO LATE AFTERNOON SATURDAY WELL INTO SUNDAY. MAINTAINED A 
DRY AND VERY WARM SUNDAY AS THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS IS EXPECTED TO BE 
IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION. THE CHANCE FOR CONVECTION INCREASES 
LATER SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS ANOTHER STRONG SPRING STORM SYSTEM 
BUILDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA. EXACT FRONTAL TIMING UNDETERMINED FOR 
THIS LATER PERIOD OF THE FORECAST BUT THE FRONT MAY BE EAST OF THE 
MOUNTAINS BY LATE AFTERNOON MONDAY SO DROPPED POPS BACK TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE MONDAY NIGHT AS THERE IS SOME INDICATION OF TRAILING SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY IN THE BACK SIDE OF DEPARTING UPPER TROF. MORE RIDGING 
WILL FOLLOW THIS SYSTEM INTO MID WEEK...THEREFORE REBOUNDING TEMPS 
AND SUNSHINE SHOULD RETURN. IT APPEARS THAT ANOTHER MID LATITUDE 
CYCLONE WILL APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA AGAIN ON THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRY WEATHER EXPECTED TO PERSIST 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS THE DOMINANT 
FEATURE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. SURFACE HIGH WILL 
SHIFT EAST THROUGH THE PERIOD RESULTING IN STRENGTHENING 
SOUTHWESTERLY RETURN FLOW. THIS ALONG WITH SIGNIFICANT HEIGHT RISES 
SUGGEST GOOD WARMING TREND FOR TODAY. GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO MAV 
TEMP GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...KEPT SOME LOW POPS IN
FROM THURSDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY EVENING...MAINLY FOR POSSIBLE
DIURNAL CONVECTION. SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST AND WARM AIR ADVECTION
DEVELOPS WITH SOME WEAK INSTABILITY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...BUT NOT
MUCH OF A FOCUS/TRIGGER. MAIN CONVECTIVE EVENT STILL APPEARS TO BE
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...AHEAD OF ANOTHER POSSIBLY STRONG
COLD FRONT. GFS/NAM/ECMWF ALL OFFER SIMILAR TIMING...BUT FELT IT
WAS TOO EARLY TO GO ANY HIGHER THAN 30 PERCENT POPS SUNDAY NIGHT
AND 50 PERCENT POPS FOR MONDAY. PROBABLY TOO EARLY TO PLAY UP
SEVERE THREAT MUCH AT THIS POINT. 

OTHERWISE...LATEST GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE QUITE CLOSE FROM 05/12Z

FIT IN BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS.

.DISCUSSION...LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS ENTERING WESTERN TN/WESTERN KY. 
WILL BUMP UP POPS A BIT FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS. STILL A RISK FOR 
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES...WINDS AND THE 
REST OF FORECAST ON TRACK...NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG S TO SW WINDS ALREADY
TAKING SHAPE EARLY THIS MORNING AHEAD OF OUR WELL ADVERTISED SEVERE
WEATHER SYSTEM. SUSTAINED SPEEDS OF 20 TO 35 KNOTS AND GUSTS WELL
OVER 45 TO 55 KNOTS IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN AREAS...WHERE EVENING
SHIFT UPGRADED TO A HIGH WIND WARNING. EXPANDED OUR WIND ADVISORY
TO INCLUDE REMAINDER OF VALLEY/LOWER ELEVATIONS...WITH A START-UP
TIME AT 11 AM EDT TODAY. KEPT THE WIND ADVISORY/WARNING EXPIRING AT
8PM EDT (SINCE WE WILL LIKELY BE ISSUING SEVERAL SVR/POSSIBLY TOR
WARNINGS BY THEN). LATER SHIFTS CAN ADJUST THE ADVISORY/WARNING AS
NEEDED. 

OTHERWISE...MODELS IN FAIR AGREEMENT ON BULK OF THE STRONG TO
SEVERE STORMS TO REACH VALLEY LOCATIONS AND EASTWARD AREAS MAINLY 
AFTER 05/00Z...BUT I KEPT LIKELY POPS IN LATE THIS AFTERNOON FOR
OUR CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AREAS. ADDED WORDING OF STORMS MAY PRODUCE
DAMAGING WINDS AND HEAVY RAINFALL (SEE DAY ONE EXCESSIVE RAINFALL
OUTLOOK). 

TEMPS STARTING OUT EXTREMELY MILD WHERE STRONG WINDS ALOFT ARE
ALREADY MIXING DOWN TO THE SURFACE (NOTE 70 DEGREES AT TYS AT 3 AM
EDT). THUS...I NUDGED MAX TEMP GRID UP TO THE WARMER GFS MOS HIGHS 
WHICH SHOULD STAY A FEW DEGREES BELOW RECORD HIGHS FOR TODAY (CHA - 
88...TYS - 87...AND TRI - 82).

ONE FINAL CONCERN...LOW AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES WITH STRONG WINDS
WHICH COULD BE VERY NEAR RED FLAG CRITERIA FOR SMOKY MTN DISTRICT. 
WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS IN OUR HWO PRODUCT FOR NOW...AND LET DAY SHIFT 
MONITOR OR CHECK WITH FIRE MANAGEMENT FOLKS. WILL SEND OUT OUR SPS
PRODUCT FOR SEVERE THREAT ONE MORE TIME.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...BEHIND STRONG COLD FRONT 
SHOWERS END TUESDAY MORNING WITH STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION DROPPING 
TEMPERATURES 20-25 DEGREES AS COLD HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES IN. TUESDAY 
NIGHT LOWS IN THE UPPER 20S TO MID 30S WILL BRING ANOTHER FREEZE TO 
COLDER LOCATIONS AND FROST TO WARMER AREAS WEDNESDAY MORNING. THEN 
QUICK WARMING TREND THROUGH THURSDAY. HIGHS BACK TO NEAR SEASONAL 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. A NEW FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY THURSDAY AND A WARM FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
FRIDAY. AS HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY 
INCREASE WILL ALLOW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP FRIDAY. 
FORECAST AREA REMAINS IN WARM SECTOR SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT SO KEPT 
RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THE 
FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG S TO SW WINDS ALREADY
TAKING SHAPE EARLY THIS MORNING AHEAD OF OUR WELL ADVERTISED SEVERE
WEATHER SYSTEM. SUSTAINED SPEEDS OF 20 TO 35 KNOTS AND GUSTS WELL
OVER 45 TO 55 KNOTS IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN AREAS...WHERE EVENING
SHIFT UPGRADED TO A HIGH WIND WARNING. EXPANDED OUR WIND ADVISORY
TO INCLUDE REMAINDER OF VALLEY/LOWER ELEVATIONS...WITH A START-UP
TIME AT 11 AM EDT TODAY. KEPT THE WIND ADVISORY/WARNING EXPIRING AT
8PM EDT (SINCE WE WILL LIKELY BE ISSUING SEVERAL SVR/POSSIBLY TOR
WARNINGS BY THEN). LATER SHIFTS CAN ADJUST THE ADVISORY/WARNING AS
NEEDED. 

OTHERWISE...MODELS IN FAIR AGREEMENT ON BULK OF THE STRONG TO
SEVERE STORMS TO REACH VALLEY LOCATIONS AND EASTWARD AREAS MAINLY 
AFTER 05/00Z...BUT I KEPT LIKELY POPS IN LATE THIS AFTERNOON FOR
OUR CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AREAS. ADDED WORDING OF STORMS MAY PRODUCE
DAMAGING WINDS AND HEAVY RAINFALL (SEE DAY ONE EXCESSIVE RAINFALL
OUTLOOK). 

TEMPS STARTING OUT EXTREMELY MILD WHERE STRONG WINDS ALOFT ARE
ALREADY MIXING DOWN TO THE SURFACE (NOTE 70 DEGREES AT TYS AT 3 AM
EDT). THUS...I NUDGED MAX TEMP GRID UP TO THE WARMER GFS MOS HIGHS 
WHICH SHOULD STAY A FEW DEGREES BELOW RECORD HIGHS FOR TODAY (CHA - 
88...TYS - 87...AND TRI - 82).

ONE FINAL CONCERN...LOW AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES WITH STRONG WINDS
WHICH COULD BE VERY NEAR RED FLAG CRITERIA FOR SMOKY MTN DISTRICT. 
WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS IN OUR HWO PRODUCT FOR NOW...AND LET DAY SHIFT 
MONITOR OR CHECK WITH FIRE MANAGEMENT FOLKS. WILL SEND OUT OUR SPS
PRODUCT FOR SEVERE THREAT ONE MORE TIME.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...BEHIND STRONG COLD FRONT 
SHOWERS END TUESDAY MORNING WITH STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION DROPPING 
TEMPERATURES 20-25 DEGREES AS COLD HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES IN. TUESDAY 
NIGHT LOWS IN THE UPPER 20S TO MID 30S WILL BRING ANOTHER FREEZE TO 
COLDER LOCATIONS AND FROST TO WARMER AREAS WEDNESDAY MORNING. THEN 
QUICK WARMING TREND THROUGH THURSDAY. HIGHS BACK TO NEAR SEASONAL 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. A NEW FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY THURSDAY AND A WARM FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
FRIDAY. AS HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY 
INCREASE WILL ALLOW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP FRIDAY. 
FORECAST AREA REMAINS IN WARM SECTOR SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT SO KEPT 
RAIN CHANCES THROUGH THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THE 
FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY PERIOD.

WITH CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT OVER THE TN VALLEY. LATEST TEMPS WERE 
HOLDING IN THE MID AND UPPER 30S OVER NRN PLATEAU AND CENTRAL VALLEY 
AREAS...SO DROPPED THE FREEZE WARNING FOR THOSE AREAS. A FEW COLD 
SPOTS OVER SW VA AND NE TN...EVEN THOUGH CLOUDS LINGER THERE AS 
WELL...BUT SOME LOCATIONS MAY EXPERIENCE A HARD FREEZE BY DAYBREAK.

QPF IS PROGGED TO BE QUITE LIGHT AND SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS 
LOOK GOOD FOR TODAY. SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX TONIGHT MAY GENERATE SOME 
AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN...OR POSSIBLY SNOW OVER NE TN AND SW VA. 
PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK FOR TONIGHT...WITH 
LITTLE CHANGES MADE. ANY SNOW ACCUMULATION LOOKS QUITE MINIMAL.

CLOUD COVER SHOULD INHIBIT REACHING THE WARMER MOS HIGHS AGAIN FOR 
TODAY...SO I STAYED CLOSE TO OR JUST BELOW THE COOLER HIGHS. MODELS 
DIFFER SLIGHTLY TONIGHT ON 850 MB TEMPS...AND A MOS BLEND WAS CLOSER 
TO PREVIOUS GRIDS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...PERSISTENT EASTERN
TROUGH FINALLY MOVES TO THE NORTHEAST SATURDAY TAKING LIGHT
PRECIPITATION WITH IT. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN OR SNOW EARLY ONLY
EXTREME NORTH. BRISK NW FLOW AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. MAY NEED
WIND ADVISORY HIGHER ELEVATIONS TOMORROW. FOLLOWED CLOSER TO COOLER
MAV GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL KEEP SKIES PARTLY
CLOUDY SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER COLD NIGHT SATURDAY
NIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID 30S TO LOWER 40S. A STRONG WARMING TREND
SUNDAY. DEVELOPING SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS MONDAY WILL MOVE INTO THE

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED ALONG 
THE SOUTH CAROLINA COAST...WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING NORTH 
OF IT ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL SOME VERY LIGHT PRECIP OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA 
THIS EVENING...WITH SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT PRECIP FURTHER UPSTREAM 
OVER NORTHERN MIDDLE TN AND WESTERN KY. WITH A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH SLOWLY MOVING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...THINK IT 
WOULD BE BEST TO KEEP A LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE FORECAST 
AREAWIDE. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILE 
WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW IN AREAS THAT FALL CLOSE TO 
THE FREEZING MARK. WITH AN EXTENSIVE LAYER OF CLOUDS EXPECTED TO 
LINGER BENEATH A MID-LEVEL STABLE LAYER TONIGHT...THINK THAT TEMPS 
SHOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME FALLING MUCH BELOW THE CURRENT READINGS 
(ESPECIALLY BELOW THE CURRENT DEWPOINTS WITH NOT MUCH DRY AIR 
ADVECTION EXPECTED). WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE FREEZE WARNING FOR 
OVERNIGHT SINCE TEMPS IN SOME AREAS ARE ALREADY CLOSE TO FREEZING... 
AND SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME OCCASIONAL BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS 
FURTHER UPSTREAM OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO MENTION 
SOME SMALL POPS EVERYWHERE...AND TO REMOVE ANY EVENING WORDING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE AREA 
WILL SLOWLY SHIFT EAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS OVERNIGHT.
AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TONIGHT 
AND THURSDAY. TONIGHT STARTS OUT WILL ABUNDANT MOISTURE TRAPPED 
UNDER INVERSION NEAR 3500 FEET. LIGHT DRIZZLE AND FOG WILL PERSIST 
UNTIL DRIER AIR FILTERS IN SLOWLY FROM THE NORTHWEST. UPPER JET 
SEGMENT SUPPLIES LIFT EARLY THU BRINGING MORE CLOUD COVER AND PCPN 
ACROSS THE REGION. WENT BELOW MOS POP GUIDANCE WITH PROGGED JET AXIS 
ALONG EAST SIDE OF MRX CWA. NEAR NORMAL TEMPS TONIGHT WITH COOL 
TEMPS THU UNDER CLOUD COVER. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CONFIDENCE REMAINS 
LOW THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM AS MODELS CONTINUE TO SUFFER FROM 
POOR RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY AND POOR MODEL-TO-MODEL AGREEMENT. AS A 
RESULT...DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST. 
APPEARS MOST SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION IN THE MONDAY NIGHT TO TUESDAY TIME FRAME. HOWEVER...EVEN 
WITH THIS SYSTEM...TIMING REMAINS UNCERTAIN AND GOING ANY HIGHER 
THAN HIGH CHANCE POPS IN ANY SPECIFIC PERIOD IS DUBIOUS. WENT WITH 
DRY FORECAST FOR NOW FOR THE WEDNESDAY PERIOD NEXT WEEK. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO MAV/MEX GUIDANCE WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF MONDAY AND TUESDAY MAX TEMPS WHICH WERE UNDERCUT 
SLIGHTLY BASED ON TRENDS IN THE GEFS ENSEMBLES.

MOVED OFF TO THE EAST THIS MORNING. MID LEVELS ARE DRYING OUT FOR 
THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON. INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WILL MOVE 
EAST ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NW

REMAINDER OF TODAY. SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH KY THIS 
AFTERNOON. PRECIPITATION CHANCES STILL REMAIN FAIRLY HIGH. CHARACTER 
OF PCPN WILL BE CONFINED TO LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE. SON

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH 
THROUGH THE MRX CWA DURING THE MORNING AND POSSIBLY EARLY AFTERNOON 
HOURS AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS ACROSS THE REGION.  AS A

THROUGHOUT THE DAY.  A FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER OVER FAR EASTERN AND 
NORTHERN AREAS THIS EVENING...BUT OVERALL WILL SEE DRY CONDITIONS 
OVERNIGHT.  WILL KEEP TEMPS NEAR GUIDANCE.

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODEL 
AGREEMENT/CONSISTENCY VERY POOR...AND FORECAST CONFIDENCE MUCH LOWER 
THAN USUAL RIGHT FROM THE START OF THE PERIOD.  GFS SEEMS TO BE AN 
OUTLIER TO THE WEST WITH THE EAST COAST LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WHILE 
NAM MAY BE TOO FAR EAST/FAST...SO WILL LEAN TOWARD A GFS/NAM/SREF 
BLEND THU AND KEEP POPS ON THE LOW SIDE.  TIMING OF WEAK IMPULSES

THINK KEEPING SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS THOSE PERIODS BEST FOR 
NOW.  MAY BE SOME HIGHER ELEVATION SNOW DURING THE EARLY PERIODS 
GIVEN EXPECTED THERMAL PROFILES...BUT FOR NOW AM KEEPING POPS/QPF 
LOW.  WILL GO DRY SATURDAY AND MOST OF THE AREA SUNDAY. HIGHER 
CONFIDENCE THAT A SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE REGION LATE IN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE 
STRETCHED FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS SW THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND 
OHIO VALLEY TO THE MID ATLANTIC. A STATIONARY FRONT LIES ALONG THE 
GULF COAST WEST INTO TEXAS. ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA HIGH PRESSURE 
HAS HELPED CLEAR SKIES ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA EXCEPT THE 
EXTREME SOUTH. DRIER AIR WAS NOTED NORTH WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 20S 
AND 30S WITH 40S SOUTH. A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH LIES OVER THE 
EASTERN TN VALLEY. QUIET PATTERN THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE SHORT LIVED 
AS CLOUDS INCREASE RAPIDLY TONIGHT AS SHORT WAVE TROUGH DIGS SOUTH 
AND EAST THROUGH MID MS AND OHIO VALLEYS THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS. 
LOW PRESSURE RIDES NE ALONG FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE SOUTH AND GETS 
CAUGHT UP INTO INVERTED TROUGH. ELEVATED THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE LATE 
TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MAINLY SOUTH OF I-40. RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 
ABOUT ONE INCH ON AVERAGE NEXT 24 HOURS BUT HIGHER AMOUNTS WITH ANY 
THUNDERSTORMS. THIS MAY CAUSE NEW RISES ON SMALL STREAMS AND 
NUISANCE FLOODING IN URBAN AREAS. LOWS TONIGHT WILL LIKELY COME 
EARLY AND THEN STEADY OR SLOWLY RISE AS CLOUDS INCREASE DURING THE 
EVENING. SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY IN THE MORNING 
WITH DECREASING POPS DURING THE AFTERNOON. FOLLOWED THE LOWER MET 
GUIDANCE OR A FEW DEGREES LOWER FOR HIGHS DUE TO CLOUDS AND RAIN 
KEEPING TEMPERATURES DOWN.       

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE DEEPEN ACROSS THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION THROUGH 
THE BEGINNING OF THE MEDIUM RANGE FORECAST.  A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVE 
WILL DIVE INTO THE UPPER TROUGH WITH ANOTHER WAVE RIDING UP THE 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL REMAIN 
SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST...BUT WILL MAINTAIN CHANCE POPS 
ESPECIALLY FOR THE EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. ENOUGH 
COLD AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA TO PRODUCE A MIXTURE OF RAIN/SNOW 
FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR EASTERN 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND THURSDAY NIGHT. LIGHT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS.

LAST IN SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES WILL PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING. AGAIN...VERTICAL PROFILES COLD 
ENOUGH FOR RAIN/SNOW FOR THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND FAR EAST TENNESSEE. 

UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EAST SEABOARD LIFTS NORTHEAST FOR THE WEEKEND 
ALLOWING RIDING ALOFT AND RETURN OF WARMER AIR FOR LATE SATURDAY 
INTO SUNDAY AS WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTHEAST. WILL CONTINUE WITH A 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO LIFTING OVER WARM 
FRONT...ESPECIALLY FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH MONDAY MORNING.  

A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT SHORT-WAVE WILL EJECT EAST-NORTHEAST ALONG WITH
ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. COLD FRONT WILL PULL 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY 
MORNING. AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE 
OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY. WE WILL NEED TO MONITOR THIS POTENTIAL 
FOR THE FORECAST AREA.

THE UPPER 30S. AS SKIES CLEAR TONIGHT AND WINDS ARE LIGHT FROST IS 
EXPECTED TO FORM. ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL ALSO BE IMPORTANT 
FOR FROST. SOME FOG WILL LIKELY BE OBSERVED ESPECIALLY NEAR MOISTURE 
SOURCES...LAKES AND RIVERS. ISSUING FREEZE WARNING NORTH AND FROST 
ADVISORY SOUTH DUE TO VEGETATION GROWTH FROM THE WARM TEMPERATURES 
EARLIER THIS MONTH. NOT AS CONFIDENT SOUTHERN AREAS FOR MUCH FROST 
WITH CLOUD COVER POSSIBLY LASTING LONGER THERE AND SOME HIGH CLOUDS 
COMING IN LATER TONIGHT.     

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN FEATURE THROUGH 
THE MEDIUM TERM FORECAST WILL BE AN UPPER TROUGH DEEPENING ACROSS

INTO THIS DEVELOPING UPPER TROUGH. 

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...A SHORT-WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY AND GULF COAST STATES WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH SETTING OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER ROUGH OF SHOWERS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH ENOUGH ELEVATED INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE A CHANCE 
OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA.

THIS WAVE WILL BE QUICKLY REPLACED BY ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE MOVING 
ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS FOR LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY PRODUCING A ROUND OF SHOWERS. A STRONG SHORT-WAVE MOVES 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FAST MOVING SHORT WAVE WILL EXIT 
THE AREA EARLY TODAY...AND ANY LINGERING PRECIP WILL QUICKLY END.
WILL CONTINUE THE SPS FOR A FEW MORE HOURS TO ADDRESS SOME MINOR SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL
REMAIN TO OUR NORTH WITH THE NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT WELL TO OUR
SOUTH THROUGH THE PERIOD. PERSISTENT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL LINGER
THROUGH MUCH OF TODAY...AND CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH
CLEARING WILL OCCUR LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT AS STUBBORN LOW CLOUDS
MAY BE HARD TO GET RID OF. FOR NOW WILL SHOW AT LEAST SOME CLEARING
ESPECIALLY NORTH FURTHER FROM THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. HOW MUCH
CLEARING IS OF COURSE CRITICAL FOR LOW TEMPS TONIGHT. MAY BE COLD
ENOUGH FOR A FREEZE WARNING NORTHERN COUNTIES IF CLEARING
OCCURS...BUT LOOKS BORDERLINE SO NO ISSUANCE AT THIS TIME GIVEN
UNCERTAINTY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WENT A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE 
GFS FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. THE ATMOSPHERE APPEARS RELUCTANT TO 
ALLOW MORE SPRINGLIKE WEATHER TO BLOSSOM ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. 
WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF RIDGING UNTIL LATER IN THE WEEKEND. WE 
MIGHT SEE A LITTLE SUNSHINE ON TUESDAY AS THE FORECAST AREA AWAITS 
THE ARRIVAL OF A SHORT WAVE TROF DUE INTO THE REGION LATER TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. THIS FEATURE MAY HAVE SOME INSTABILITY 
AVAILABLE FOR CONVECTION SO CONTINUED WITH MENTION OF SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR MAINLY THE SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
CATEGORICAL POPS LATER TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. SYSTEM 
DEPARTS LATE AFTERNOON WITH A BRIEF PAUSE IN THE ACTION WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY UPPER TROF AMPLIFIES ACROSS THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION WITH CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AS SEVERAL IMPULSES 
ROTATE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE DEEPENING UPPER TROF. APPLIED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP FOR THE EXTREME NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA AS 
A FINAL SHORTWAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST IN CLIPPER FASHION ACROSS THE 
UPPER OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS LATER FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY. DURING THE PERIOD THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING 
THE HIGHEST TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS 
BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS 
SO APPLIED WHERE NECESSARY. ECMWF/GFS DIFFER ON LATE WEEKEND 
DEPICTION WITH THE ECMWF MUCH LESS OPTIMISTIC ON FINALLY ALLOWING 
FOR BUILDING HEIGHTS AND A WARMER SCENARIO FOR SUNDAY. WENT WITH THE 
PROGRESSIVE GFS WHICH MOVES THE OFFENDING COLD UPPER TROF OUT TO SEA 
FASTER THAN THE ECMWF.

A FAST-MOVING SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL CROSS THE AREA

FREEZING LEVEL DROPPING TO AROUND 2 KFT ACROSS THE NORTH BEFORE THE

ISOTHERMAL LAYER...SO THE POTENTIAL FOR ERROR IS HIGH AND CONFIDENCE 
IS LOW. SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS LOOK TO BE ISOLATED TO THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND NE TN...BUT COULD APPROACH ADVISORY CRITERIA 
OF OVER 2 INCHES. AT THIS TIME A SPS WILL BE ISSUED TO ADDRESS THE 
SNOW POTENTIAL. PRECIP SHOULD END QUICKLY MONDAY MORNING ONCE THE

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A BREAK IN THE SUCCESSION OF SYSTEMS MONDAY NIGHT WITH HIGH
PRESSURE EXTENDING SOUTHWEST FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO THE

HIGHER ELEVATIONS EASTERN MOUNTAINS. MAY NEED TO ISSUE A FREEZE
WARNING BY THE NEXT FORECAST CYCLE IF SKIES STAY CLEAR WITH NEXT
MODEL RUN AND ENOUGH AREA WILL BE BELOW FREEZING LATE MONDAY NIGHT

FRONT IN TEXAS AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING OUT OF THE ROCKIES MOVES
INTO THE PLAINS AND THEN OHIO VALLEY BY TUESDAY EVENING. LOW
PRESSURE AREA AND COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MODELS BRING
FRONT THROUGH AROUND 18Z WEDNESDAY. THINK THIS MAY BE TOO FAST SO
HAVE INCREASED POPS LATER IN THE DAY. AIRMASS UNSTABLE ENOUGH FOR
THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE DAY. BRIEF DRYING WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THEN
MORE SHORTWAVE ENERGY COMES THROUGH TROUGH THAT SETS UP ACROSS THE

SWING ACROSS THE AREA LATE TONIGHT.  MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
OVERALL...BUT SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS ESPECIALLY TONIGHT.  
NAM KEEPS MOST PRECIP SOUTH TONIGHT...AND IS A BIT COLDER...WHILE 
GFS IS WARMER AND SPREADS MORE PRECIP NORTH.  GIVEN 
UNCERTAINTY...WILL LEAN TOWARD A COMPROMISE...WITH CHANCE POPS NORTH 
AND LIKELY SOUTH AND CENTRAL LATE TONIGHT.  FREEZING LEVELS LIKELY 
TO BE LOW ENOUGH FOR SOME SNOW NORTHERN ZONES ESPECIALLY HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.  PRECIP AMOUNTS SHOULD BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE WITH THIS 
SYSTEM. LOOKS LIKE SUB FREEZING TEMPS WILL NOT BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH 
IN AREAS WHERE THE FREEZE WARNING PROGRAM HAS STARTED TO WARRANT ANY 
FREEZE WARNINGS AT THIS TIME.     

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...QUITE AN ACTIVE PERIOD WITH 
AT LEAST THREE SYSTEMS GENERATING PRECIP IN FAST FLOW ALOFT. WEAK 
SHORT WAVE RAPIDLY MOVES AWAY TO THE EAST DURING THE MORNING ON 
MONDAY BUT NOT BEFORE PRODUCING A FEW SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS IN EXTREME 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS COLD AIR DROPS SOUTH BEHIND THE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM TRAVERSING THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. THIS MORNING. PRECIP SHOULD 
BE PRETTY MUCH GONE BY AFTERNOON AS THE SYSTEM RAPIDLY DEPARTS. KEPT 
MONDAY NIGHT DRY BUT SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL BE RIPPLING TOWARD THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AGAIN ON TUESDAY. THE UPPER TROUGH WILL ENCOURAGE 
A SURFACE LOW ALONG A FRONTAL BOUNDARY DRAPED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
TIER TO MAKE A MOVE NORTH EAST FROM SOUTHEAST TEXAS TO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AND STAYED WITH A GRADUAL 
INCREASE IN POPS WITH POSSIBLE ISENTROPICALLY LIFTED SHOWERS LATER 
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. APPLIED HIGHEST POPS 
AFTER MIDNIGHT TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH A SMALL CHANCE 
FOR CONVECTION AS THE LOW PULLS A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA. WAS ABLE TO KEEP WEDNESDAY NIGHT DRY AS THIS SYSTEM EXITS THE 
FORECAST AREA. BASICALLY KEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST 
UNCHANGED DUE TO FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MODEL SOLUTIONS 
FOR THIS PERIOD. GFS AND ECMWF VERY DISSIMILAR WITH A LATE WORK WEEK 
UPPER TROF SO KEPT SLIGHT AND SMALL CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY NIGHT WHILE MAINTAINING A DRY SATURDAY AS BOTH MODELS 
INDICATE DRIER NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WITH AMPLIFIED UPPER RIDGE 
APPROACHING FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. HAD TO TRIM SEVERAL

LOW PRESSURE TRACKING FROM THE OZARKS TO THE APPALACHIANS WILL 
SPREAD RAIN ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA TONIGHT. THE WARM FRONT WILL 
REMAIN JUST SOUTH OF OUR AREA...WHILE THE 850 MB FRONT WILL BE NEAR 
THE TN/VA BORDER. SO SURFACE BASED CONVECTION AND THE SEVERE THREAT 
WILL STAY SOUTH...BUT ELEVATED INSTABILITY WILL MEAN A GOOD CHANCE 
OF THUNDER ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. ON THE NORTHERN END...FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS SHOW A DEEP ISOTHERMAL LAYER THAT STAYS 2-4 DEGREES ABOVE 
FREEZING ALL NIGHT...SO NO FROZEN PRECIP ISSUES ARE EXPECTED. ONCE 
THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER TRACKS EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS SUNDAY 
MORNING...DRIER AIR ALOFT MOVES IN AND PRECIP CHANCES WILL TAPER OFF 
FROM WEST TO EAST...ENDING EVERYWHERE IN THE AFTERNOON. PLENTY OF 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL KEEP CLOUDY SKIES OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE

THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING WITH AN INVERTED
SURFACE TROUGH. VERTICAL PROFILE LOOKS GOOD ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A
MIXTURE OF FREEZING RAIN...SLEET...AND SNOW ACROSS PARTS OF

MAIN AREA OF PRECIP ACROSS NORTHERN GA/AL IS OCCURRING JUST NORTH
OF A STATIONARY FRONT. THE RUC SHOWS ISENTROPIC LIFT AND
CONVERGENCE ZONE AROUND 925 MB WITH THIS PRECIP BAND. AS WE GO
THROUGH THE DAY...THIS ZONE OF LIFT MAKES VERY SLOW NORTHWARD
PROGRESS...AND DOES NOT MOVE INTO THE CENTRAL TN VALLEY UNTIL LATE
AFTERNOON. SO THE SOUTHERN AREAS WILL CONTINUE TO SEE THE GREATEST
PRECIP TODAY...WITH VERY LITTLE NORTH AND CENTRAL. WILL ADJUST POPS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT FORECAST 
TO REMAIN SOUTH OF OUR AREA AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES ALONG IT.  SHOWERS 
WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREAS...WITH HEAVIEST PRECIP SOUTH WHERE 
FAVORABLE JET DYNAMICS SHOULD ENHANCE PRECIP TODAY.  APPEARS THERE 
MAY BE ENOUGH ELEVATED INSTABILITY FOR SOME THUNDER...BUT SEVERE 
THREAT SHOULD REMAIN MAINLY SOUTH OF OUR AREA IN THE WARM SECTOR.  
ISOLATED FLOODING CANNOT BE RULED OUT ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND PERHAPS 
CENTRAL AREAS...ALTHOUGH AT THIS POINT DOES NOT APPEAR THAT HEAVY 
RAIN WILL BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO WARRANT A FLOOD WATCH.  LOOKS LIKE 
FREEZING LEVELS WILL BE HIGH ENOUGH FOR A MAINLY RAIN EVENT...BUT 
WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF SLEET LATE FOR SOME HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW 
VA.   

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE 
GFS FOR THIS PERIOD. FIRST WAVE WILL BE MOVING AWAY SUNDAY MORNING 
AND ADJUSTED POPS BACK THROUGH THE DAY TO ACCOUNT FOR SYSTEM 
DEPARTURE. ECMWF/NAM TRY TO GENERATE SOME LIGHT QPF ON MONDAY WITH A 
WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING RAPIDLY EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. NOT TOO 
CONFIDENT IN SYSTEM'S ABILITY TO PRODUCE PRECIP IN DRIER ENVIRONMENT 
BEHIND LATE WEEKEND LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SO KEPT THE FORECAST DRY 
HERE. WAS ABLE TO KEEP A DRY PERIOD GOING RIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING 
AS BRIEF PERIOD OF UPPER RIDGING GIVES WAY TO THE NEXT UPPER TROF 
AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW. GRADUALLY INCREASED POPS TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON THROUGH MIDNIGHT AS SHORT WAVE TROF PRESSES EAST ACROSS 
THE UPPER MIDWEST WHILE DEEPENING SURFACE LOW DRAGS A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY MORNING. TRENDED POPS DOWN 
THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR POSSIBLE TIMING ERRORS IN 
DEPARTURE OF THIS MID LATITUDE CYCLONE. WAS ABLE TO ALLOW FOR 
ANOTHER DRY PERIOD WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING AS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AWAITS YET ANOTHER AMPLIFYING SYSTEM IN 
ACTIVE SPRING PATTERN. ECMWF/GFS A LITTLE DIFFERENT IN DEPICTION OF 
THIS FEATURE WITH THE GFS SLIGHTLY SLOWER AND STRONGER WITH 
DEEPENING UPPER TROF. TRENDED POPS FROM SLIGHT CHANCE ON THURSDAY TO 
MEDIUM CHANCE THURSDAY NIGHT WITH A GRADUAL DECREASING TREND IN POP

PRECIP WILL BE LATTER PART OF THE NIGHT IN THE SOUTHWEST CLOSER TO 
THE WARM FRONT...SO WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS THERE. WILL CARRY CHANCE 
CENTRAL AND ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE FAR NORTH IN SW VA.  FREEZING LEVELS 
FORECAST TO BE LOW ENOUGH FOR WINTRY PRECIP TO BE POSSIBLE HIGHER 
TERRAIN IN SW VA...BUT NOT MUCH PRECIP EXPECTED WITH ONLY A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP...SO WILL JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWER/SNOW 
SHOWER FOR SOME OF THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS.   


.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...FORECAST CONFIDENCE RATHER 
LOW LATER IN THIS PERIOD AS NUMEROUS LOWER AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVES 
MOVE RAPIDLY EAST IN FAST NEARLY ZONAL FLOW REGIME. THE FIRST 
FEATURE INDUCES A WAVE ON FRONTAL ZONE OVER THE SOUTHERN TIER LATE 
IN THE WORK WEEK WHICH PULLS A WARM FRONT TOWARD THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT STRENGTHENS 
FOR HIGH PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY WITH A 
POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA INSTABILITY INCREASES IN THE VICINITY OF THE BOUNDARY. ANOTHER 
WAVE DROPS IN LATER SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AS COLDER AIR SPILLS 
IN BEHIND THE FRONTAL WAVE. THERE COULD EVEN BE A FEW SNOW SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE SMOKIES SUNDAY NIGHT IN THIS PATTERN. WAS ABLE TO APPLY A 
DRY MONDAY WITH SHORT WAVE RIDGING AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. BY MID 
WEEK ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE MIDWEST DRIVING A 
SURFACE LOW ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. MAINTAINED SLIGHT THROUGH 
LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY FOR THIS FEATURE. BOTH THE GFS/ECMWF SHOW AN AMPLIFYING 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WITH ASSOCIATED WEATHER MOVING INTO THE EASTERN 
STATES AROUND THE END OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. INTRODUCED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS SYSTEM. TRIED TO TREND 
MAX AND MIN TEMPS CLOSER TO NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
SATELLITE THIS AFTERNOON SHOWS EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER UPSTREAM TO 
NORTHERN OH. WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOWING A STRONG INVERSION IN 
PLACE...EXPECT THAT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL REMAIN TRAPPED...AND 
CLOUDS WILL REMAIN BROKEN TO OVERCAST ALL NIGHT. AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS 
ARE IN THE MID-LOWER 30S...AND ARE NOT MUCH LOWER UPSTREAM. AS A 
RESULT...CURRENT FORECAST TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 20S NORTH ARE 
LIKELY TOO LOW...AND A HARD FREEZE WILL LIKELY NOT OCCUR. MOS 
GUIDANCE LOW TEMPS ARE AROUND 30 IN SW VA AND NE TN...AND WILL ADD A 
COUPLE DEGREES TO THIS. THE FREEZE WATCH WILL BE CANCELLED. ALTHOUGH 
THERE ARE SOME SHOWERS IN SW VA THIS AFTERNOON...THEY SHOULD BE GONE 
BY 00Z AS MOISTURE DEPTH AND LAPSE RATES DECREASE SO WILL NOT 
INCLUDE ANY POP FOR THE TONIGHT PERIOD.

DAYTIME MIXING SHOULD HELP ERODE THE CLOUDS IN THE MORNING...LEAVING 
MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES FOR MUCH OF FRIDAY. A 500 MB VORT MAX APPROACHES 
FROM THE WEST LATE IN THE AFTERNOON...INCREASING MIDLEVEL CLOUDS AND 
PROVIDING SOME WEAK LIFT. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE 
PLATEAU COUNTIES LATE.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH PULLING A WARM FRONT BACK NORTH 
TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BEGINNING FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT. THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET COMBINED WITH ISENTROPIC 
LIFT AND FRONTOGENETIC FORCING ACROSS THE SOUTH WILL PRODUCE PERIODS 
OF RAIN. 

MODELS DIFFER ON EXACT PATH OF SURFACE WAVE ON FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY...BUT ENOUGH RETURN OF ELEVATED INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE A 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT.  

FOR SUNDAY...SHORT-WAVE AND SURFACE LOW MOVES EAST WITH CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS DIMINSHING.

FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...ECMWF AND GFS GREATLY DIFFER ON HOW FAR 
SOUTH FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PULLED SOUTH AND INTENSITY OF NEXT 
SHORT-WAVE AND SURFACE LOW PULLING EAST OF THE ROCKIES.  CONFIDENCE 
IS LOW...BUT WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW THE GFS AND CONTINUE A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS FOR MAINLY THE SOUTHERN EARLY WEEK...THEN A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AREA-WIDE FOR WEDNESDAY.

LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION BELOW A STRONG MIDLEVEL INVERSION WILL
KEEP MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVER MUCH OF THE AREA TODAY. CLOUDS ARE

.SHORT TERM(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR INDICATING MOST OF THE 
PRECIPITATION IS OUT OF THE CWA AS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE HEADS OUT 
OF THE REGION.  A FEW SHOWERS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE THIS MORNING BUT 
MOST OF THE AREA SHOULD BE DRY TODAY. LINGERING CLOUDS SHOULD HINDER 
TEMPERATURES FROM RISING MUCH TODAY. STAYED NEAR THE COOLER MAV 
NUMBERS FOR TODAY. NORTHWEST FLOW TONIGHT WILL BRING IN COOL 
TEMPERATURES.  MAY SEE FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN THE NORTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE CWA AND THE MOUNTAINS. SINCE THE NORTHERN VALLEY AND 
SOUTHWEST VA ARE IN THE FREEZE PROGRAM...WILL ISSUE A FREEZE WATCH 
FOR THOSE AREAS. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE 
IN FAIR AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...BUT THEN BEGIN TO DIVERGE EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH THE TIMING 
OF ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. OVERALL...AN ACTIVE PATTERN IS 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH TWO SEPARATE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEMS AFFECTING THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS WEEKEND AND 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE DEEP SOUTH IS PROGGED 
TO MOVE NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT ON FRIDAY...AND INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA ON SATURDAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY INCREASE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THIS WARM FRONT...SO WILL SLOWLY INCREASE 
POPS FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON INTO SATURDAY. AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT...CREATING SOME INSTABILITY OVER THE AREA AND A 
CHANCE FOR TSTORMS. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN CONTINUES TO BE A LITTLE 
STRONGER AND FURTHER NORTH WITH THIS SYSTEM THAN THE ECMWF 
MODEL...AND CONSEQUENTLY BRINGS THE WARM SECTOR (AND ITS RESULTING 
INSTABILITY) FURTHER NORTH OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY NIGHT. 
THUS...WILL CONTINUE WITH A MENTION OF TSTORMS FOR SATURDAY...BUT 
ESPECIALLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT. 

ECMWF MODEL CONTINUES TO SHOW ANOTHER STRONGER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
QUICKLY DEVELOPING OVER THE DEEP SOUTH DURING THE MONDAY/TUESDAY 
TIME FRAME...BUT THE GFS MODEL HAS SLOWED THIS SYSTEM DOWN (WITH A 
WEAKER SYSTEM) UNTIL THE TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME. FOR

WINDS ALOFT MAY BE FORCED TO THE SURFACE WITH STRONG DOWNDRAFTS. 
SURFACE WINDS FROM THE SW SHOULD MEAN A LESSER THREAT OF TORNADOES 
IN OUR AREA. 

CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
EVENING...TAPERING OFF BEFORE MIDNIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES INTO

A THREAT OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR THIS
AFTERNOON...WITH THE GREATEST CHANCES ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF
THE AREA. REGIONAL SOUNDINGS SHOW MIDLEVEL LAPSE RATES NEAR DRY
ADIABATIC AND WET-BULB ZERO HEIGHTS BELOW 10 KFT...SUGGESTING LARGE
HAIL POTENTIAL IS FAVORABLE. HOWEVER THE SOUNDINGS FROM RNK AND OHX
SHOW A SIGNIFICANT INVERSION THAT MUST BE OVERCOME BEFORE
CONVECTION INITIATES. MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS WILL OCCUR ONCE THE
UPPER JET NOSES INTO THE AREA TO PROVIDE DIVERGENCE ALOFT...AROUND
18Z. THE TIME PERIOD OF THE BEST SEVERE THREAT LOOKS TO BE BETWEEN
19Z AND 00Z AS LOW LEVEL THETA-E AND CONVERGENCE PEAK AHEAD OF THE
COLD FRONT. HIGH LCL HEIGHTS AND UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND PROFILE
SUGGEST A MINIMAL THREAT OF TORNADOES...ALTHOUGH STRONG WINDS ALOFT
COULD PRODUCE SOME DAMAGING STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS WITH THE STRONGER
STORMS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...PLEASANT SEVENTY TO LOWER 
EIGHTY DEGREE WARMTH WILL SUFFER A SETBACK BY THURSDAY AS THE NICE 
RIDGE WITH EXTENDED PERIOD OF SOUTHERLY FLOW IS REPLACED BY AN UPPER 
TROF AND MUCH COLDER AIR. THE UPPER TROF WILL BUILD ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES LATER TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MAKING PROGRESS INTO THE 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. BY 12Z THURSDAY. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WITH 
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE FROM THE MIDWEST INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BY 
MID EVENING. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG THIS 
BOUNDARY IN THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY DURING THE MORNING AND WILL MAKE 
THEIR WAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AROUND 19-23Z. SHEAR AND 
INSTABILITY WILL BE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT FOR SEVERE CONVECTION 
DURING THIS PERIOD SO WILL MAKE MENTION IN THE ZONES. THE MAIN 
THREATS WILL BE DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WIND AND LARGE HAIL. 
HOWEVER...THERE WILL BE A SMALL RISK FOR TORNADIC STORMS. TRAILING 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPPING THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF THE UPPER TROF 
WILL KEEP A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS GOING THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ALL THE WAY INTO THURSDAY 
MORNING FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. ANOTHER MILD 
NIGHT (FOR MARCH) IN STORE TONIGHT WITH 70 DEGREE PLUS WARMTH AGAIN 
DUE TO STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL SYSTEM ON 
WEDNESDAY. BY THURSDAY HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL EASILY BE 30 DEGREES 
COLDER THAN TODAY'S HIGHS. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH 
THE SHORT TERM.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...WARM FRONT RETURNS TO 
TENNESSEE VALLEY ON FRIDAY. CLOUDS ON THE INCREASE WITH A CHANCE FOR 
PCPN FRI NGT. BOUGHT INTO SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY ON SAT. 
SURFACE LOW WILL TRACK EAST ALONG WARM FRONT WITH GOOD UPPER 
SUPPORT. SURFACE LOW AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EAST OF THE 
AREA EARLY SUNDAY. POPS FOR SUNDAY MAY BE OVERDONE...ESPECIALLY IN 
THE AFTN. SHIFTED FORECAST TO STRONGER HIGH PRESSURE WITH DRIER AND 
COOLER CONDITIONS MONDAY. ANOTHER SIMILAR LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AROUND 
THE TUESDAY TIME FRAME. GFS APPEARS TO BE HAVING TROUBLE WITH THESE

FRONT WILL ALSO HELP TO STRENGTHEN THE PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...RESULTING IN BREEZY CONDITIONS. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AFTER A DRY AND MILD START 
TO THE LONG TERM...CONDITIONS DETERIORATE BY MID WEEK AS AN UPPER 
TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONT APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION IN THE LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH EARLY THURSDAY TIME FRAME. 
CONTINUED WITH IDEA OF CONVECTIVE NATURE TO PRECIP AS FRONT PASSES 
THROUGH THE AREA. ONLY MODEST RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED AT THIS 
TIME AS MAIN AREA OF PRECIP MOVES RAPIDLY THROUGH THE AREA AND 
ASSOCIATED MOISTURE IS SOMEWHAT LIMITED. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW FOLLOWS 
FRONTAL PASSAGE. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ON THURSDAY...MAINLY 
CONFINED TO HIGHER TERRAIN. BRIEF DRY PERIOD DEPICTED THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND FRIDAY BEFORE ANOTHER SYSTEM...OR EVEN SERIES OF 
SYSTEMS...APPROACHES. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE CONSIDERABLY BY THE 
WEEKEND PRECLUDING MUCH CONFIDENCE FOR THE END OF THE LONG TERM. 
THERE IS ENOUGH SUPPORT FROM GEFS ENSEMBLES TO WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE 
TO CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE WEEKEND HOWEVER. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY 
DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON 
HAS BEEN WELL TO OUR NORTH FROM THE SRN OHIO VALLEY SE ACROSS W VA.
DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE RECOVERED INTO THE 40S TO LOWER 50S ACROSS OUR 
FORECAST AREA...BUT WARM TEMPS ALOFT HAVE KEPT AIRMASS QUITE STABLE
EXCEPT FOR CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AREA WHERE LIFTED INDICES HAVE REACHED 
-2 TO -3 DEGREES CELSIUS. NAM 12KM AND RUC HINT AT WEAK CONVERGENCE 
LATE TONIGHT INTO SE TN AND SW NC...SO I ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
THERE (WHICH ALSO MESHES BETTER WITH GSP CHANCE POPS TONIGHT).

ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO STRETCH OUT E-W TO OUR N...AND
POSSIBLY SAG TO NEAR SE KY AND SWRN VA MONDAY EVENING. KEPT SOME 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THERE INTO MONDAY EVENING. OTHERWISE...DRY AND
QUITE WARM THROUGH THESE PERIODS...WITH RISING HEIGHTS ALOFT AND
WARM SW LOW LEVEL FLOW.

CLOUD COVER WILL MAX OUT AT NIGHT AND THEN SHOULD GIVE WAY TO A MIX 
OF CLOUDS AND SUNSHINE DAYTIME. THUS...FAVORED MILDER MINS AND 
WARMER MAXES. ALTHOUGH THESE ARE VERY WARM TEMPS...RECORD HIGHS ARE 
NOT IN JEOPARDY EITHER DAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER TROF SWINGS 
SOUTHEAST FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND INTO 
THE NORTHEASTERN STATES FROM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
FROPA WITH SYSTEM COLD FRONT OCCURS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND STAYED WITH 
CONVECTION FOR PRECIP TYPE WEDNESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING WITH 
MODELS PROGGING SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY WITH THIS SYSTEM. UPPER TROF 
AMPLIFIES THROUGH THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. ON THURSDAY AND A TRAILING 
SHORT WAVE MOVES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS GENERATING A FEW SHOWERS...SO KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS MAINLY FOR FAVORED HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES. WAS ABLE TO KEEP 
THE FORECAST DRY THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD ON 
SATURDAY WITH RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE EASTERN STATES. NEXT UPPER 
TROF ADVANCES TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY SATURDAY EVENING AND 
APPLIED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AT THIS TIME WHILE ADJUSTING 
FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION ON SUNDAY AS SYSTEM COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES. RAISED POPS TO LOW CHANCE FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT 
MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA.

IS PROGGED TO LIFT NORTH AS A WARM FRONT LATE TONIGHT AND SUNDAY... 
SO I CARRIED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS JUST FOR SE TN/SW NC OVERNIGHT.

LOOKS LIKE MORE CLOUDS THAN PRECIPITATION WITH THE PASSING WARM
FRONT...SO I TRIMMED POPS BACK CONSIDERABLY...ACTUALLY REMOVING
POPS FOR BOTH SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. CLOUDS SHOULD DECREASE
NICELY BY MONDAY...WITH PLENTY OF MIXING AND BRISK SW TRANSPORT
WINDS FOR PRESCRIBED BURNING IN OUR FIRE DISTRICTS.

MOS TEMPS WERE CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED EACH PERIOD.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...ADDED JUST A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP FOR A SHOWER ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS MODELS SHOW SHORT WAVE TROF MIGRATING EAST FROM 
THE WESTERN LAKES THROUGH THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. DURING THIS PERIOD. 
IN ADDITION...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MEANDER ACROSS THIS AREA 
PROVIDING A POSSIBLE FOCUS FOR A SHOWER. NEXT SYSTEM SHIFTS EAST 
SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS WITH A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
CENTER PRESSING STEADILY EAST TOWARD THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. GRADUALLY INCREASE POPS FROM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN POPS WILL BE HIGHEST WITH SYSTEM COLD FRONT 
MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY WILL BE 
AVAILABLE FOR CONVECTION SO KEPT THIS IDEA GOING. UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGHING WILL SET UP FOR BUSINESS ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER 
OF THE NATION THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY AND THIS WILL BRING AN END TO THE 
PLEASANT 60-70 DEGREE WARMTH ENJOYED EARLIER IN THE WEEK. ALSO...HAD 
TO KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ON THURSDAY WITH MOISTURE AND 
LIFT WITH ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THERE WILL BE ENOUGH COLD AIR IN PLACE 
THURSDAY NIGHT IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR THE MENTION OF SNOW 
SHOWERS. WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM DRY AS THE

.DISCUSSION...NOT SURE THAT E-W WEAK COLD FRONT LIES AS FAR SOUTH AS 
HPC DEPICTION AT 13Z...BUT PROBABLY HAS EASED THROUGH NRN 2/3RDS OF 
OUR FORECAST AREA...BASED ON LOWERING DEW POINT TEMPS. SPOTTY 
SHOWERS CONTINUE TO MAINLY OCCUR ALONG AND JUST SOUTH OF THE TN-KY 
AND TN-VA LINES. 

MODIFIED 12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW VERY LITTE INSTABILITY FOR 
TODAY...HINDERED BY WARM AIR ALOFT FROM SUBSIDENCE UNDER UPPER 
RIDGE. THUS...I WOULD THINK THAT THUNDER PROSPECTS ARE EXTREMELY LOW 
AND COVERAGE OF SHOWERS WILL STAY AROUND 20 PERCENT OR SO. LOCATION 
OF SHOWERS WILL BE IN VICINTY OF WEAK FRONT...AND ALSO IN SMOKIES 
AND SRN MTNS WHERE WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE DEVELOPS LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT APPEARS TO
BE SAGGING SOUTH INTO NRN PARTS OF KY THIS AFTERNOON...AND WILL BE
THE MAIN IF NOT ONLY FOCUS FOR POTENTIAL CONVECTIVE PCPN OVER THE
WEEKEND. MODELS DROP THE FRONT BARELY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON
SATURDAY...THEN LIFT IT NORTH AS A WARM FRONT ON SUNDAY. I CAN'T
GET VERY EXCITED ABOUT RAIN CHANCES THOUGH...GIVEN WEAK INSTABILITY
AND A FLAT FLOW ALOFT. THUS...I TRENDED WELL BELOW THE HIGHER MOS
POPS EACH PERIOD...STAYING IN THE TOKEN 20-30 PERCENT RANGE FOR NOW.

WARMER MOS HIGHS CHOSEN IN AREAS WHICH WILL BE OR END UP SOUTH OF
THE WARM FRONT...AND COOLER MOS HIGHS FOR SW VA AND NE TN. MOS MINS
FAIRLY CLOSE AND FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...HELD ONTO SLIGHT CHANCE 
POP FOR SHOWERS EARLY SUNDAY NIGHT AS WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVES 
ACROSS THE MIDWEST. THERE COULD BE A COUPLE SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT MOVES 
NORTH. TRIED TO ALLOW FOR A BREAK IN THE PROBABILITY OF PRECIP FOR 
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS MODELS INIDCATE UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDING INTO THE EASTERN STATES. BROUGHT SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS 
BACK INTO THE FORECAST TUESDAY NIGHT WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH OUT AHEAD OF MORE SIGNIFICANT 
UPPER TROF AND SUFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM EXPECTED FOR LATER WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. APPLIED INCREASING CHANCE POPS FOR THIS 
EVENT AND USED THUNDER WITH MODELS SHOWING NEGATIVE LI'S. UPPER TROF 
AMPLIFIES OVER THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION ON THURSDAY SO 
HAD TO KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS GOING HERE. BY FRIDAY THE

ALLOW A SW GRADIENT TO DEVELOP BEFORE DAYBREAK. ALSO...EXPECT A 
GRADUAL INCREASE IN CLOUDS FROM THE NORTH...ASSOCIATED WITH THE

FOG FROM DEVELOPING. FAVORED MILDER MOS MINS IN WRN AREAS AND HIGHER 
TERRAIN AREAS...BUT COOLER MOS MINS IN SHELTERED NRN VALLEY SPOTS 
SUCH AS TRI.

KEPT FRIDAY DRY FOR NOW...BUT ADDED MORE CLOUDINESS ACROSS NRN 
PLATEAU...NE TN AND SW VA AREAS. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN SLIGHTLY 
COOLER (STILL ABOVE CLIMO) MAX TEMPS FOR THOSE AREAS...WHILE CHA AND

WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...THEN
LIFT BACK NORTHEAST FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL KEEP MONDAY AND

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...LINGERING CLOUD COVER THIS 
AFTERNOON IS THE MAIN CONCERN FOR TONIGHT...AS THESE CLOUDS HAVE 
HINDERED TEMPS FROM REACHING THE POTENTIAL 50S TO LOWER 60S THIS 
AFTERNOON. MOS DIFFERS BY SEVERAL DEGREES ON MINS TONIGHT...WITH 
COLDER MINS ONLY ACCEPTABLE IF CLOUDS TOTALLY CLEAR WITH CALM WINDS. 
THUS...HAVING TO SLOW DOWN THE CLOUD DISSIPATION LEADS ME TO GO MORE 
WITH A BLEND OF MOS MINS...ALSO FACTORING IN DEW POINT TEMPS 
UPSTREAM.

MUCH NICER SPRING DAY IN STORE FOR THE REGION THURSDAY...AS UPPER 
RIDGE BUILDS EAST AND SURFACE RIDGE BEGINS TO SLIP SE OF THE REGION.
THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR A NICE WARM-UP TO SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE CLIMO.
EVEN WARMER HIGHS ON TAP FOR FRIDAY AS SW LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS 
BETWEEN THE SURFACE RIDGE TO OUR E-SE AND DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE 
OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS STATES. WARMER MOS MINS FAVORED IN HIGHER 
TERRAIN FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND COOLER MOS IN SHELTERED NRN VALLEYS.
MOS HIGHS FOR FRIDAY ARE 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE CLIMO AND LOOK GOOD.

HOWEVER...IN SPITE OF WARMING TEMPS...NO RECORD HIGHS EXPECTED 
EITHER DAY. RECORD HIGHS FOR THURSDAY ARE...CHA-84...TYS-80 AND 
TRI-78...THEN RECORD HIGHS FOR FRIDAY...CHA-83...TYS-80 AND TRI-78.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A WEAK FRONT IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. 
MOISTURE IS LIMITED...SO KEPT ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING. A

REMAINS NORTH...SO KEPT SUNDAY DRY. RIDGING BUILDS BACK IN ON MONDAY

.AVIATION...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL STALL NEAR THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE

THROUGH MONDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROF SHIFTS EAST FROM THE PLAINS.
DON'T EXPECT SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON FLIGHT OPERATIONS DURING THE

BELIEVE STRONGER IMPULSE WITH INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT MAY BE
ABLE TO PRODUCE A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS THAT MAY IMPACT THE TERMINALS
ON MONDAY. STILL BELIEVE PROBABILITY TOO LOW FOR A MENTION AT THE
SITES TONIGHT...BUT WILL WATCH TO SEE IF AN AMENDMENT MAY BE

WILL BEGIN LIFTING NORTH AS A WAVE OF LOW PRESSURE APPROACHES.  
MODELS HAVE HAD A HARD TIME WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND STILL DO NOT 
AGREE ON THE DETAILS...SO THIS IS A LOWER THAN USUAL CONFIDENCE 
FORECAST FOR A SHORT TERM PERIOD.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
NORTH AND CENTRAL AND CHANCE SOUTH TONIGHT...THEN LIKELY NORTH AND 
CENTRAL WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS SOUTH ON MONDAY.  MOISTURE AND LIFT 
LOOK TO BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED...SO PRECIP AMOUNTS SHOULD BE ON THE 
LIGHT SIDE...WITH THE HIGHER VALUES NORTH.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM 
MAV TEMPS.    

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...TRACK OF SYSTEM EARLY IN 
THE LONG TERM STILL SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN...THUS TIMING OF MAIN PRECIP 
AXIS PROGRESSION AND DEPARTURE OF PRECIPITATION IN LIMBO. APPEARS AT 
THIS POINT THAT SYSTEM WILL TRACK TO OUR WEST AND NORTH LEADING TO A 
MAIN PRECIP AXIS PROGRESSING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY MORNING AS TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH. KEPT LIKELY POPS GOING AREA-WIDE ON MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY...BUT UNDERCUT CATEGORICAL MAV GUIDANCE POPS DUE TO THE 
TIMING UNCERTAINTY. MODEL SOLUTIONS START TO DIVERGE WITH RESPECT TO 
SYSTEM DEPARTURE...WITH THE NAM SHOWING THE SYSTEM PRETTY MUCH 
LOSING ITS INFLUENCE ON OUR REGION BY EARLY WEDNESDAY WHILE THE GFS 
HAS AN UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE ROTATING THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING 
WITH LINGERING PRECIP. HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS CONFINED TO FAR 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS FOR THIS TIME PERIOD FOR NOW. BALANCE OF FORECAST 
STILL GENERALLY DRY PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS WITH WARMING 
TREND IN RESPONSE TO SIGNIFICANT HEIGHT RISES AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS 
INTO THE EASTERN CONUS. ANOTHER WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY SAGS INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION LATE FRIDAY...BUT HAVE ONLY INTRODUCED 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS BASED ON ITS SIMILARITY TO CURRENT SURFACE FRONT 
OVER THE AREA WHICH HAS BEEN A NON-ISSUE SO FAR. GENERALLY DID NOT 
DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...CLOUDS CONTINUE TO DISSIPATE

CLOUDS AROUND TONIGHT...AS AN AREA OF SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTROL OUR WEATHER INTO SATURDAY.  A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH 
NORTHERN AREAS BY LATE SATURDAY...BUT EXPECT JUST AN INCREASE IN 
CLOUDS.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST A FEW 
TWEAKS.

RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY. MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT A WEAK 
WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED COLD FRONT WILL SAG INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION BY EARLY SUNDAY. MOISTURE RATHER SHALLOW AND 
OTHERWISE UNIMPRESSIVE WITH THIS FEATURE. HOWEVER...DID INTRODUCE 
SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS ON SUNDAY. NAM DEPICTS THIS WEAK 
BOUNDARY WILL PUSH WELL SOUTH OF OUR AREA BY MONDAY WHILE THE GFS 
STALLS THE FRONT IN OUR GENERAL VICINITY AND DEPICTS ANOTHER WAVE 
MOVING ALONG THE BOUNDARY BY LATE MONDAY. OTHER THAN A GENERAL 
WARMING TREND...REMAINDER OF LONG TERM EQUALLY UNCERTAIN. GIVEN THE 
UNCERTAINTY...HAVE NOT MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PRECEDING 
GRIDS/FORECAST AND KEPT REMAINDER OF LONG TERM DRY IN SPITE OF VARIOUS

430 AM EST THU MAR 10 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTAL SHOWERS WILL GRADUALLY 
SHIFT EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS EARLY TODAY WHILE 
DEEPENING UPPER TROF ADVANCES FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. 
ENOUGH STRENGTHENING WILL OCCUR FOR A CLOSED 50H LOW TO APPROACH THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH SLOW EASTWARD MOVEMENT ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. LIGHT RAIN WILL DEVELOP IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
THIS FEATURE INITIALLY BUT VERY COLD AIR ALOFT AND MORE THAN 
ADEQUATE LIFT WITH SOME INSTABILITY...THE RAIN WILL MIX WITH AND 
CHANGE TO SNOW IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER AS THE AFTERNOON PROGRESSES. THE WINTER STORM WATCH 
WAS UPGRADED TO A WARNING FOR HEAVY SNOW FOR THE AFTERNOON THROUGH 
MID MORNING FRIDAY WHERE SNOWFALL TOTALS MAY RANGE FROM 3 TO 6 
INCHES WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS AT ELEVATIONS ABOVE 5500 FEET. 
ADDED A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR LIGHTER SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION ON 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU NEAR THE KENTUCKY BORDER AS WELL AS THE LOWER 
ELEVATION AREAS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THAT 
WERE NOT INCLUDED IN THE WINTER STORM WARNING. IN THESE AREAS...1-3 
INCH ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED BY LATE TONIGHT. BELIEVE ANY SNOWFALL 
WHICH OCCURS ACROSS CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE WILL BE VERY LIGHT AND 
WILL ONLY HAVE A CHANCE TO STICK TO GRASSY SURFACES DUE TO SOMEWHAT 
MILDER TEMPERATURES. USED A SLOWLY FALLING TEMPERATURE SCHEME TODAY 
AS COLDER ADVECTS IN ON WESTERLY FLOW AND DESCENDS UNDERNEATH THE 
UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES 
UNDER THE CLOSED UPPER LOW ALONG WITH A 30+ KT UPSLOPE FLOW WILL 
KEEP SNOW SHOWERS GOING INTO FRIDAY. AN ADDITIONAL INCH OF SNOW MAY 
ACCUMULATE IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS FRIDAY MORNING. DECREASING MOISTURE 
DEPTH AND INCREASING TEMPS ALOFT WILL BRING AN END TO THE SHOWERS 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. 

WEAK MIDLEVEL RIDGING WILL PROVIDE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND 
SUB-FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN MOST SPOTS FRIDAY NIGHT. THE UPPER JET 
AND A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASS TO THE NORTH ON SATURDAY...WHICH WILL 
INCREASE MID-HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS BUT DRY LOW LEVELS WILL PREVENT ANY 
CHANCE OF PRECIP. 

SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF CONTINUE FOR DAYS 
4-7. THE GFS REMAINS RELATIVELY DRY...WHILE THE ECMWF SHOWS A CLOSED 
LOW CROSSING THE REGION MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE PREVIOUS 
FORECASTS HAVE LEANED MORE TOWARD THE ECMWF...AND THIS TREND WILL BE 
CONTINUED...KEEPING A LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY. SINCE CONFIDENCE IS LOW...FEW CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO THE 
FORECAST.

TONIGHT.   

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FOR THURSDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY...UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS WITH MODERATELY STRONG NORTHWEST OROGRAPHIC FLOW 
DEVELOPING. NAM AND GFS SHOW TEMPERATURES DROPPING FAIRLY QUICKLY 
THURSDAY BEHIND FROPA...WHICH OCCURS IN THE MORNING. SNOW LEVELS 
WILL DROP THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT TO THE VALLEY FLOOR. SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS OF 3 TO 6 INCHES ARE EXPECTED...MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FEET 
MSL. HEAVIER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS...SUCH

THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHERN PLATEAU MAY 
ALSO EXPERIENCE LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. THE RAIN WILL CHANGE TO 
SNOW ACROSS THE VALLEY THURSDAY EVENING...BUT LITTLE TO NO 
ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

FOR LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...RIDGING WILL CLEAR OUT THE CLOUD

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG STORM SYSTEM ALREADY MAKING 
AN IMPACT ON THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WITH STRENGTHENING 
WINDS ALOFT AS LOW LEVEL JET PRESSES EAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
STAYED WITH THE WIND ADVISORY THROUGH THIS EVENING AS FRONTAL PUSH 
SHOULD BE ABLE TO MIX STRONG FLOW ALOFT TO THE SURFACE AS IT 
ADVANCES TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS. THE OTHER MAIN FEATURE IN ASSOCIATION 
WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE THE PROLONGED PERIOD OF HEAVY RAIN AS VERY 
HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER STREAMS NORTH INTO THE REGION. THE MOISTURE 
WILL BE EFFICIENTLY LIFTED IN A SCENARIO WHICH INCLUDES A LENGTHY 
PERIOD OF CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF A SLOW MOVING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WITH 
STRONG DIVERGENCE ALOFT IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF 120 KT JET. STAYED 
WITH A CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA WHILE 
SHIFTING TO CATEGORICAL CONVECTIVE POPS FOR SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA LATER IN THE DAY AS NARROW INSTABILITY AXIS 
BUILDS EAST AHEAD OF SYSTEM COLD FRONT. AREAL PRECIP TOTALS WILL BE 
IN THE 1-2 INCH RANGE WITH LOCALIZED AMOUNTS CLOSE TO 3 INCHES 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WHERE THE 
BEST COMBINATION OF MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE LOCATED. A FLOOD WATCH 
WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT UNTIL LATE EVENING DUE TO TIMING OF HEAVY RAIN 
IN PROXIMITY TO THE RECENT TWO WEEK PERIOD OF EXCESSIVE RAINFALL THE 
REGION HAS EXPERIENCED. MAX TEMPERATURE FORECAST COULD BE 
CHALLENGING AS USUAL WITH STRONG SOUTHERLY DOWNSLOPE FLOW POSSIBLY 
ALLOWING THE NORTHERN GREAT VALLEY TO BECOME A LITTLE WARMER THAN 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. USED A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL BECOME 
NEGATIVELY TILTED AND TRANSITION INTO A CLOSED LOW AS IT CROSSES THE 
APPALACHIANS ON THURSDAY. COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE 850 MB TROUGH ON 
THURSDAY WILL RESULT IN TEMPS NEARLY STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING 
THROUGH THE DAY. FALLING MIDLEVEL TEMPS WILL CREATE INSTABILITY FOR 
SHOWERS. BY THURDAY EVENING PRECIP WILL TRANSITION TO SNOW 
SHOWERS...WHICH WILL CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY MORNING. THE NAM PRODUCES 
WARNING-CRITERIA SNOW AMOUNTS IN THE MOUNTAINS...BUT THIS APPEARS 
OVERDONE AS THE GFS AND SREF SHOW MUCH LESS. A 25 KT NW FLOW WILL 
ENHANCE SNOW AMOUNTS IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT THE LACK OF SYNOPTIC 
LIFT AND SMALL WINDOW OF ADEQUATE MOISTURE DEPTH SHOULD HELP LIMIT 
AMOUNTS TO ADVISORY LEVELS OR LOWER. TEMPS NEAR TO JUST ABOVE 
FREEZING WILL PREVENT MUCH ACCUMULATION IN VALLEY LOCATIONS. 

THE REST OF THE LONG TERM WILL REMAIN RELATIVELY UNCHANGED. A SERIES 
OF FAST-MOVING SHORTWAVE TROUGHS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW 
NORMAL...BUT WITH MOISTURE LACKING WE SHOULD STAY DRY THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND. THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE QUITE DIFFERENT FOR DAYS 6 AND 7...SO 
WILL LEAVE THE CURRENT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...A STRONG COLD FRONT 
WILL PUSH THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE SHORT 
TERM.  INITIAL SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL MOVE IN OVERNIGHT WITH A LARGE 
BAND OF RAIN SHOWERS WITH SOME EMBEDDED HEAVY RAINFALL AND POSSIBLY 
A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER ON WEDNESDAY.  THE MAIN BAND OF RAIN WILL 
EXIT THE AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON BUT WILL CONTINUE TO SEE AREAS OF 
LIGHT TO MODERATE RAINFALL INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  WITH RECENT HEAVY 
RAINFALL COMBINED WITH PROJECTED RAIN FROM THE INCOMING SYSTEM... 
COULD SEE SOME FLOODING...MAINLY ACROSS NORMALLY FAVORED AREAS AND 
ALONG ALREADY HIGH RUNNING RIVERS.  A FLOOD WATCH WILL REMAIN IN 
EFFECT BEGINNING TONIGHT AND CONTINUING THROUGH MIDNIGHT WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT.  ADDITIONALLY...A STRONG LOW LEVEL JET WILL ACCOMPANY THE 
FRONT AND WILL INCREASE WINDS ACROSS THE AREA LATE TONIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY.  WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME QUITE STRONG...REACHING 
ADVISORY CRITERIA ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS OF EAST TN AND 
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OVER WISE AND RUSSELL COUNTIES IN VA.  A 
WIND ADVISORY HAVE BEEN ISSUED FOR THESE AREAS.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MOST ACTIVE PERIOD WILL BE 
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...ON BACKSIDE OF EXITING SYSTEM. SOME 
CONCERN FOR A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION IN HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA AND 
NE TN...AS NW UPSLOPE FLOW DEVELOPS WITH SOME LINGERING MOISTURE 
INTO THURSDAY NIGHT (SREF PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1/4 TO 
1/3 INCH). 

THE PARTIAL THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS COOL ENOUGH FOR MOSTLY SNOW 
SHOWERS BY THURSDAY EVENING...SO I INCREASED OUR POPS TO LOW END OF 
LIKELY IN OUR TYPICALLY FAVORED AREAS. KEPT THE SNOW AMOUNTS MAINLY 
IN THE 1 TO 2 INCH RANGE FOR NOW...AS HPC WWD DAY 3 GRAPHIC HAS 
LOWERED AMOUNTS FROM PREVIOUS GRAPHIC. ALSO...NEIGHBORING NWS 
OFFICES ARE NOT HITTING THIS SNOW POTENTIAL VERY HARD AT THIS TIME.
WILL LET LATER SHIFTS MONITOR THIS WINTRY WEATHER EVENT...AS WIND 
AND FLOOD THREATS DOMINATE THE SHORT TERM PERIODS. I WILL UPDATE THE 
HWO PRODUCT AND ADD A MENTION OF LIGHT SNOW POSSIBLE THURSDAY NIGHT.

DRY WEATHER LOOKS ON TRACK FOR FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY
WITH A DRY COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE STILL ON TRACK FOR LATE SATURDAY. 
MODELS DIVERGE CONSIDERABLY FOR DAYS 6 AND 7...LEADING TO LOW 
CONFIDENCE FOR NOW. ECMWF TRAPS A WEAK UPPER LOW UNDER THE RIDGE 
THAT BUILDS OVER THE CENTRAL AND NRN PLAINS EARLY NEXT WEEK...AND
OFFERS A DRY FORECAST FOR BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY. 12Z GFS MODEL 
KEEPS THE PATTERN PROGRESSIVE WITH A SRN STREAM SHORT WAVE SPREADING 
RAIN/SHOWERS INTO THE TN VALLEY/SRN APPALACHIANS ON MONDAY INTO 
EARLY TUESDAY. FOR NOW...A COMPROMISE WITH BLENDED FORECAST GRIDS TO 
MESH WITH NEIGHBORS. 

FOR TEMPS...GFSX MOS HIGHS ON THURSDAY LOOK TO OCCUR EARLY THEN 
STEADY OR FALLING IN THE AFTERNOON...SO I TRENDED TOWARD OR BELOW 
THE COOLER HIGHS. OTHERWISE...GFSX MOS MAX AND MIN TEMPS WERE 
CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
300 AM EST TUE MAR 8 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES WILL STRENGTHEN OVER 
THE PLAINS TODAY...THEN TRACK TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY. 
STRONG MOISTURE ADVECTION AHEAD OF THIS SLOW MOVING SYSTEM WILL 
RESULT IN SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL TOTALS TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. GIVEN THE PREVIOUS HEAVY RAIN ON SUNDAY WHICH RAISED RIVER 
LEVELS...FLOODING POTENTIAL LOOKS HIGH. 

PRECIP BEGINS THIS EVENING DUE TO ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MIDLEVEL 
MOISTURE ADVECTION. THE NAM BRINGS IN MUCH MORE PRECIP TONIGHT THAN 
THE GFS...WILL LEAN TOWARD THE LOWER GFS AMOUNTS AT ONSET. THE 
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET PICKS UP TO 50 KTS AFTER MIDNIGHT...CREATING 
FAVORABLE MOUNTAIN WAVE CONDITIONS. THE NAM SHOWS THE LLJ UP TO 65 
KTS...BUT IT MAY BE OVERDONE AS THE GFS IS 10-20 KTS WEAKER. WILL 
ISSUE A WIND AVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS 
STARTING AT MIDNIGHT. THE HEAVIER PRECIP WILL ARRIVE AFTER 12Z WED 
AS THE UPPER JET BECOMES POSITIONED FROM CNTL KY TO MI...PLACING OUR 
AREA IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION. WIDESPREAD RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
AROUND 2 INCHES WILL BE COMMON...WITH LOCALIZED AREAS UP TO 3 
INCHES. A FLOOD WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE ENTIRE AREA 12Z 
WEDNESDAY TO MIDNIGHT THURSDAY. STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE ACTING ON 
SOME WEAK ELEVATED INSTABILITY MAY GIVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSTMS 
SOUTH AND WEST. PRECIP BEGINS TO TAPER OFF WITH THE SURFACE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING THROUGH 
THURSDAY DUE TO A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH AND A 30 KT UPSLOPE WIND AT 
850 MB. PRECIP COULD BRIEFLY TRANSITION TO SNOW THURSDAY NIGHT 
BEFORE ENDING. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF THIS PERIOD OF THE
FORECAST EXCEPT FOR MONDAY/TUESDAY WHERE GFS TRIES TO BRING A STORM
SYSTEM INTO THE REGION FASTER THAN THE ECMWF. TRENDED TIMING OF
THIS FEATURE A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE ECMWF APPLYING A SLIGHT CHANCE
POP FOR SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT. KEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST
DRY WITH PROBABILITY JUST A LITTLE TOO LOW FOR MENTION. SATURDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING A SHORTWAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT
LAKES ON ITS WAY INTO THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND A COLD FRONT WILL
ACCOMPANY THIS SYSTEM. AT THIS TIME IT APPEARS SUFFICIENT MOISTURE
WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE TO PRODUCE PRECIPITATION. AFTER THIS TROF
MOVES AWAY...SHORT WAVE RIDGING WILL ALLOW FOR A BIT OF A WARMING
TREND WITH SOME SUNSHINE FOR MONDAY. BASICALLY FOLLOWED PREVIOUS
TEMPERATURE FORECAST WITH ONLY MINOR CHANGES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE 
NORTHEAST AND AWAY FROM THE AREA TONIGHT ALLOWING THE APPROACH OF 
THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM.  HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL INCREASE ON 
TUESDAY...BUT PRECIP WILL HOLD OF THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  
THEREFORE...WILL SEE DRY CONDITIONS AND NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR 
THE NEXT 24 HOURS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...BRIEF DRY PERIOD ENDS 
ABRUPTLY WEDNESDAY AS THE NEXT UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND COLD FRONT 
APPROACH. BEST INSTABILITY WILL BE ACROSS THE GULF COAST 
STATES...BUT STRONG LOW LEVEL JET AND FORCING WILL CREATE ANOTHER 
ROUND OF SHOWERS...ENDING AS SOME SNOW SHOWERS FOR NRN AREAS 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. EVEN WITH CONVECTION ONGOING TO OUR 
SOUTH...SHOULD SEE AVERAGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 1 TO 2 INCHES 
AGAIN...SO PROBABLY WILL BE NEEDING A FLOOD WATCH BY WEDNESDAY

OVERCAST LOW CLOUDS WILL PERSIST OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE

SITUATION...AND TI SHOWS CLOUDS DISSIPATING BY LATE MORNING AS THE
925-850 FLOW TURNS FROM NORTH TO NORTHEAST AND BOUNDARY LAYER
MIXING PICKS UP. HOWEVER THE WINDOW OF SUNSHINE LOOKS SMALL AS
MIDLEVEL CLOUDS INCREASE IN THE AFTERNOON IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN

BELOW NORMAL TODAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS AND LOWS
TONIGHT IN THE 30S.

BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY. A FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE

TEMPS HAVE BEEN MUCH COLDER TODAY THAN FORECASTED...WITH THE PRECIP 
ALSO SLOWER TO EXIT THE REGION. THIS SCENARIO HAS RESULTED IN AREAS 
OF SNOW...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...AND THE 
MOUNTAINS. HAVE EXTENDED THE WINTER WX ADVISORIES FOR THE MOUNTAINS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD...WITH A SLOW-MOVING COLD FRONT OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. 
TOWER DATA IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND FOOTHILLS CONTINUE TO REPORT 
WIND SPEEDS IN THE ADVISORY RANGE...SO WILL CONTINUE THE WIND 
ADVISORY FOR THESE AREAS THROUGH THE EVENING. A LARGE CONVECTIVE 
COMPLEX WAS OCCURRING ALONG THE GULF COAST...WHICH APPEARS TO BE 
LIMITING THE FLOW OF MOISTURE NORTHWARD FLOW INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS CONTINUE TO SHOW AN MORE SOLID AREA OF RAIN OVER MIDDLE 
TN AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...BUT ITS INTENSITY HAS DECREASED SOME 
THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS AGREE THAT AN AMPLIFYING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL GENERATE SOME MORE LIFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...BUT 
WITH LIMITED INSTABILITY EXPECTED...IT APPEARS THAT A PROLONGED 
RAINFALL WILL BE THE RESULT FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING...WITH 
AMOUNTS BETWEEN ONE AND TWO INCHES (WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS 
POSSIBLE) ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL PLAN TO KEEP THE 
FLOOD WATCH IN EFFECT...SINCE THE GROUND IS LIKELY STILL SATURATED 
FROM THE HEAVY RAINFALL EARLIER THIS WEEK. MODELS GENERALLY AGREE 
THAT THIS RAIN WILL EXIT THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON... 
WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN 
CONTROL FOR TUESDAY. MAIN WEATHER FEATURE FOR THE EXTENDED WILL BE A 
COLD FRONT THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. MODELS SHOW SOME DIFFERENCES IN TIMING. FOR NOW...HAVE 
FRONTAL PASSAGE ON WEDNESDAY AND INCREASED POPS TO HIGH CHANCE FOR 
THIS AND CONTINUED CHANCE POPS INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. POPS LINGER 
INTO THURSDAY AS THE UPPER LOW SWINGS THROUGH TO OUR NORTH. SURFACE 
HIGH BUILDS BACK IN FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. STAYED CLOSE TO

THE EASTERN SEABOARD...WITH A COLD FRONT OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. 
TOWER DATA IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ARE REPORTING WIND SPEEDS IN 
THE ADVISORY RANGE...SO WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE WIND ADVISORY FOR 
THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS THROUGH THIS EVENING. AREA RADARS SHOW 
SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH AN EXTENSIVE 
AREA OF RAIN WEST OF NASHVILLE AND CLOSER TO THE FRONT. THIS MORE 
SOLID AREA OF RAIN WILL SLOWLY MOVE EASTWARD TODAY...AND SHOULD 
START TO AFFECT THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY LATE AFTERNOON. A LARGE 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX WAS DEVELOPING OVER SOUTHERN LA...WHICH MAY 
EVENTUALLY HELP TO LIMIT THE NORTHWARD FLOW OF MOISTURE FROM THE 
GULF OF MEXICO THIS AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION...A DOWNSLOPING 
SOUTHEASTERLY WIND FLOW WILL LIKELY HELP TO SUPPRESS RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS FOR MOST OF THE 
DAY...UNTIL THIS EVENING WHEN THE AREA OF RAIN SHOULD GRADUALLY 
BECOME MORE SOLID AS THE FRONT APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE THIS MORNING TO TWEAK THE PRECIP WORDING...AND TO RAISE THE

WINDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A SHORT-WAVE WITH STRONG
UPPER DYNAMICS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND 
TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. A STRONG 300MB
JET OF 130KTS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS
PLACING THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION
OF THE JET. THE STRONG DIRECT AGEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION AROUND THE
JET WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTOGENETIC FORCING OVER THE AREA WITH ALL
MODELS SHOWING A WAVE DEVELOPING ALONG THE INCOMING FRONT. THIS
WAVE WILL HELP SLOW THE FRONT KEEPING THE FRONTOGENETIC FORCING
OVER THE AREA LONGER. CIRA TOTAL PRECIPITABLE WATER ESTIMATES SHOW
A TONGUE OF GULF MOSTURE MOVING NORTH INTO THE WESTERN TENNESSEE
AND OHIO VALLEYS WITH OVER 200 PERCENT OF NORMAL PWS.

THE ENHANCED LIFT WILL COMBINE WITH THE HIGH PWS TO PRODUCE PERIODS
OF HEAVY RAINFALL LATE TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. GIVEN THE
ALREADY SATURATED GROUND FROM THIS WEEK HEAVY RAINS...THE
ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAINFALL WILL ONCE AGAIN INCREASE THE CONCERN FOR
FLOODING/FLASH FLOODING OVER THE AREA. HAVE ISSUED A FLOOD WATCH
FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA FROM 21Z TODAY THROUGH 21Z SUNDAY.

SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY NOTED ACROSS THE AREA AS WELL...SO WILL
NOT RULE OUT A RUMBLE OF THUNDER LATE TODAY AND OVERNIGHT.

THE STRONG 850MB BOUNDARY LAYER JET WILL REMAIN AHEAD OF THE FRONT
PRODUCING WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA WINDS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WENT A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE GFS MOS HIGHS AT
TRI AND TYS DUE TO DOWNSLOPING EFFECTS.
 
.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROUGH FOLLOWS ON

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE COAST 
OF NEW ENGLAND...CREATING A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. THIS SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO BRING DEEPER 
MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WHICH WILL EVENTUALLY LEAD 
TO A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT INTO SATURDAY. 
SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS...A VEERING WIND PROFILE...AND A SIZABLE STABLE 
LAYER WILL DEVELOP OVER THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT...SO IT APPEARS THAT A 
MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT WILL DEVELOP AROUND THE MOUNTAINS AND THEIR 
IMMEDIATE FOOTHILLS. THE BIG QUESTION INVOLVES HOW STRONG THESE 
WINDS WILL BECOME...SINCE THE STRONGEST 850 WINDS APPEAR TO BE FAR 
ENOUGH NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA TO PRODUCE ONLY ADVISORY LEVEL 
WINDS. THUS...WILL ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND THEIR 
FOOTHILLS FOR TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY EVENING. 

MODELS DO NOT REVEAL MUCH INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...SO WILL 
CONTINUE WITH A MENTION OF MOSTLY SHOWERS WITH ONLY A CHANCE FOR 
TSTORMS. IN ADDITION...DOWNSLOPING SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS SHOULD KEEP 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS SUPPRESSED IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS 
AREAS ON SATURDAY...BUT THEN A WIDESPREAD RAIN AROUND AN INCH OR TWO 
SHOULD DEVELOP AREAWIDE BY SATURDAY NIGHT. SOUTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST NC WILL LIKELY RECEIVE THE GREATEST AMOUNTS OF RAIN (TWO 
TO TWO AND A HALF INCHES BY SUNDAY NIGHT)...ALTHOUGH A CONVECTIVE 
COMPLEX COULD DEVELOP ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH ON SATURDAY WHICH WOULD 
CUT-OFF THE MOISTURE FLOW INTO THE FORECAST AREA AND RESULT IN 
SMALLER RAINFALL AMOUNTS THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING FORECASTED. 
WITH MINIMAL TSTORM ACTIVITY ALSO EXPECTED...DO NOT THINK THAT FLASH 
FLOODING WILL BE A PROBLEM ALTHOUGH SOME RIVER FLOODING MAY DEVELOP 
BY SUNDAY AND MONDAY DUE TO THE LONG DURATION OF THE EXPECTED 
RAINFALL. WILL HOLD OFF WITH ISSUING ANY FLOOD WATCHES AT THIS TIME 
UNTIL THE CONVECTIVE SCENARIO FURTHER SOUTH (AND ITS IMPLICATIONS 
FOR THE FORECAST AREA) BECOMES MORE CERTAIN. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND 
GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT 
AND LOOK REASONABLE. WILL TREND WARMER THAN GUIDANCE OVER CENTRAL 
AND NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...SINCE THE 
DOWNSLOPE SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS WILL LIKELY PRODUCE ADIABATIC WARMING.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IN 
CONTROL FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY FOR A BENIGN WEATHER PATTERN. MAIN 
WEATHER FEATURE THIS EXTENDED CONTINUES TO BE A COLD FRONT PROGGED 
INTO THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. GOOD MOISTURE AND

SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS AND A VEERING WIND PROFILE DEVELOPING OVER THE 
MOUNTAINS. IT APPEARS THAT A MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT MAY DEVELOP AROUND 
THE MOUNTAINS AND THEIR IMMEDIATE FOOTHILLS ON FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY MORNING...BUT RIGHT NOW AM NOT SURE IF IT WILL BE ABLE TO 
PRODUCE WARNING-LEVEL WINDS. THE STRONGEST AXIS OF 850 MB WINDS WILL 
BE LOCATED OVER THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WHICH MAY BE TOO FAR 
REMOVED FROM THE MOUNTAINS TO PRODUCE WARNING-LEVEL WINDS. ALSO... 
THE WIND PROFILE OVER THE MOUNTAINS DOES NOT NECESSARILY INCREASE

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING. 

MODELS DO NOT REVEAL MUCH INSTABILITY WITH THE SYSTEM ON SATURDAY... 
SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A MENTION OF MOSTLY SHOWERS WITH ONLY A CHANCE

UNLESS THIS RAIN FALLS TOO QUICKLY. BUT WITH MINIMAL TSTORM ACTIVITY 
EXPECTED...IT DOES NOT APPEAR RIGHT NOW THAT FLOODING WILL BE A 
PROBLEM WITH THIS SYSTEM. ALSO...CONVECTION APPEARS TO BE MORE 
LIKELY TOWARDS THE GULF COASTAL AREAS ON SATURDAY...WHICH COULD CUT 
OFF THE MOISTURE FLOW INTO THE FORECAST AREA RESULTING IN SMALLER 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS THAN WHAT IS CURRENTLY BEING PROGGED BY THE MODELS. 
AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY GENERALLY 
ALONG THE NORTHERN TN BORDER...WITH ONLY SLIGHTLY HIGHER TEMPS AND 
DEWPOINTS SOUTH OF THIS BOUNDARY. HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER NEW 
ENGLAND WILL CREATE A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
TODAY...WITH MILD TEMPS SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY EXPECTED AS THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IS PUSHED NORTH OF THE REGION. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS 
SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE MID WEST IN THE ZONAL UPPER-LEVEL FLOW... 
BUT EXPECT ONLY SCATTERED HIGH CLOUDS TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...AND WILL NOT

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND EASTERN SEABOARD THE 
NEXT 24-36 HOURS. AIRMASS WILL REMAIN DRY WITH RELATIVE HUMIDITIES 
DROPPING TO THE UPPER 20S TO MIDDLE 30S THIS AFTERNOON. UPPER FLOW 
WILL BE ZONAL THROUGH THE SHORT-TERM. MODELS DO SHOW INCREASING 
MAINLY MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS OVERNIGHT. FOLLOWED GFS MOS 
TEMPERATURES CLOSELY FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FAVORED MODELS FOR THESE
PERIODS IS A BLEND OF OOZ GFS/18Z GEFS/12Z ECMWF. NRN AND SRN
STREAM ENERGY IS ADVERTISED AS REMAINING SEPARATE...WITH STILL SOME
MINOR DIFFERENCES IN SURFACE PATTERNS. SHOWERS DO NOT APPEAR LIKELY
TO DEVELOP UNTIL LATE FRIDAY NIGHT...SO PER COORDINATION...POPS
WERE LOWERED SLIGHTLY FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.

MAIN PERIOD OF RAIN IS SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...AS ELONGATED
SURFACE LOW AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT APPROACH. HOWEVER...I EXPECT
MAINLY SHOWERS WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS...AS BEST INSTABILITY
WILL BE TO OUR SOUTH ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES. ALSO...UPPER
LEVEL PATTERNS SUGGEST BEST DYNAMICS WILL BE TO OUR NORTH AND
SOUTH AS WELL. GULF COAST CONVECTION USUALLY INHIBITS TSRA FOR TN
VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS...BUT HARD TO DISAGREE WITH MOS
CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. RAINFALL AMOUNTS
SHOULD FALL IN THE 3/4 TO 1 1/2 INCH RANGE...MUCH LESS THAN OUR
MOST RECENT SYSTEM ON MONDAY.

OTHERWISE...DAY SEVEN (WEDNESDAY) IS TRENDING WETTER...SO NUDGED
POPS UP A BIT TO BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS. MINOR TWEAKS TO
TEMPS AND DEW POINTS IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER KENTUCKY...WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL ONLY 
A THIN LAYER OF MOISTURE AROUND 850 MB WITH THIS FRONT...WITH A MID- 
LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION BETWEEN 850 AND 750 MB. THUS...DO NOT EXPECT 
ANY SHOWERS TO DEVELOP ALONG THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY AS IT BECOMES 
QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY 
DRIFTS EASTWARD OVER NEW ENGLAND ON THURSDAY...WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW 
DEVELOPING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...LEADING TO A CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS AS MOISTURE INCREASES. WILL MENTION LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
FRIDAY...WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS... 
NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH MINS 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AND WILL TREND TOWARDS PERSISTENCE WITH MAXES.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS NOT DRASTICALLY 
DIFFERENT IN SOLUTIONS FOR THIS PERIOD AND DEPICT A PARTIALLY PHASED 
SET OF SHORTWAVE SYSTEMS...ONE OVER THE MIDWEST AND THE OTHER OVER 
THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S....PROGRESSING INTO THE EASTERN STATES ON 
SATURDAY. IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER RELATIVELY LENGTHY PERIOD OF SHOWERS 
WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION AS THE SURFACE SYSTEM SHIFTS ONLY 
SLOWLY EAST TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS BY SATURDAY EVENING. WILL HAVE 
TO WATCH THIS EVENT DUE TO THE RECENT HEFTY RAINS THE AREA HAS 
ENDURED DURING THE PAST COUPLE WEEKS. TRAILING ENERGY ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE NORTHERN SYSTEM MAY KEEP A FEW SHOWERS GOING THROUGH SUNDAY 
BEFORE WRAPPING UP LATER SUNDAY EVENING. MONDAY AND TUESDAY STILL 
APPEAR TO BE DRY AS UPPER HEIGHTS BUILD AHEAD OF YET ANOTHER HEALTHY 
STORM SYSTEM EMERGING OUT OF THE PLAINS WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. 
APPLIED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS ON WEDNESDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR 
UNCERTAINTY IN SYSTEM TIMING.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TRANQUIL CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO 
PERSIST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN 
CONTROL. SOME HIGH-LEVEL MOISTURE WILL LIKELY RESULT IN SCATTERED 
HIGH CLOUDS. WILL CONTINUE MOSTLY SUNNY SKY CONDITIONS HOWEVER AS 
THESE HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD BE MOSTLY TRANSLUCENT. GUIDANCE TEMPS ARE 
GENERALLY CLOSE AND APPEAR REASONABLE. GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE 
MUCH FROM MAV VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...RIDGING OR ZONAL FLOW
THROUGH LATE FRIDAY SHOULD KEEP FORECAST DRY UNTIL THE WEEKEND.
MODEL SOLUTIONS DIFFER ON KEY FEATURES OF THE UPPER LEVELS FOR
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING...SUCH AS PHASING OF NRN AND SRN 
STREAM SHORTWAVE ENERGY AND AMPLITUDE OF UPPER LEVEL TROUGH.
SURFACE FEATURES SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT...BUT SENSIBLE SOLUTION IS A
BLEND OF GFS/NAM/ECMWF/GEFS FOR NOW (PER HPC).

ELONGATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE LIKELY TO DEVELOP VICINITY OF MID
TO LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...WHICH WILL ALLOW MORE GULF COAST
CONVECTION TO OUR SOUTH FRIDAY NIGHT...CONSIDERABLY DIFFERENT THAN
THE SCENARIO FOR OUR STORMY WEATHER THIS MONDAY. GULF COAST
CONVECTION USUALLY INTERCEPTS SOME GULF MOISTURE AND INHIBITS
CONVECTION OVER OUR FORECAST AREA. THUS...I FAVORED JUST SLIGHT POP
INCREASES FOR NOW FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. LIKELY POPS LOOK
RIGHT ON TRACK FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT I THINK IT IS TOO EARLY TO
HIGHLIGHT SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS AT THIS POINT.

DRY FORECAST CONTINUED FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...AS 
UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION. SOUTHERLY FLOW IN THE LOW
LEVELS DEVELOPS QUICKLY...ALLOWING TEMPS TO RECOVER TO SEASONAL
VALUES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LINGERING LOW CLOUDS GRADUALLY
BREAKING UP AS NORTH WINDS BRING IN DRIER AIRMASS. TEMPS WILL START
OUT ON THE MILD SIDE DUE TO WINDS AND CLOUDS OVERNIGHT...SO WENT
WITH OR A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE THE WARMER MOS HIGHS FOR TODAY.

CLEAR TONIGHT WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SETTLING IN...TO ALLOW
LIGHT WINDS WHICH FAVORS COOLER MOS MINS.

OTHERWISE...SEVERAL UPDATES TO FOLLOW ON A FEW AREA STREAMS...
WHICH ARE RISING SLIGHTLY DUE TO YESTERDAY'S HEAVY RAINFALL. STAY
TUNED FOR THESE RIVER PRODUCTS.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE LONG
TERM IS THE NEXT SYSTEM WHICH APPROACHES IN THE LATE SATURDAY TO
EARLY SUNDAY TIME FRAME. EXTENDED-RANGE MODELS AND ENSEMBLES ARE IN
REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM...ALTHOUGH SOME ENSEMBLE
MEMBERS KEEP PRECIP LINGERING INTO MONDAY. AS SUCH...DID NOT MAKE
ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST. 

REMAINDER OF LONG TERM GENERALLY DRY WITH NEAR OR ABOVE CLIMO
TEMPS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX
GUIDANCE ALTHOUGH DID UNDERCUT GUIDANCE SLIGHTLY FOR SUNDAY AND
MONDAY BASED ON ENSEMBLE TRENDS.

SOME GUSTY SW-W WINDS THIS MORNING...WHICH IS KEEPING TEMPS VERY 
MILD AROUND 2000 FEET AND UP. THESE WINDS WILL DECREASE QUICKLY 
AFTER DAYBREAK...SO NO ADVISORY FOR TODAY.

NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF CLOUDS YET AND THE WEAK WARM FRONT APPEARS TO 
BE IN THE VICINITY OF TN-KY STATE LINE TO ACROSS SW VA. THREAT OF 
CONVECTION FOR TODAY LOOKS MINIMAL...AND I TRENDED POPS TOWARD THE 
LOWER MOS POPS...AS DID ADJACENT NWS OFFICES AS WELL. CLOUDS WILL 
GRADUALLY INCREASE...BUT WARMER MOS HIGHS LOOK GOOD...BASED ON MOS 
BEING TOO COOL FOR HIGHS ON SATURDAY. 

SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE APPROACHING WESTERN MOST 
COUNTIES LATE TONIGHT...AND WINDY CONDITIONS SHOULD DEVELOP AHEAD OF 
CONVECTION BETWEEN 06Z AND 09Z MONDAY. STRENGTH OF SW LOW LEVEL JET 
SHOULD PRODUCE WIND ADVISORY SPEEDS/GUSTS FOR HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS
...AND LAST INTO MONDAY AFTERNOON GIVEN STRONG GRADIENT AHEAD OF AND 
BEHIND COLD FRONT. THE GUSTY WINDS AND LATE ARRIVAL OF CONVECTION 
FAVORS MILDER MOS MIN TEMPS FOR TONIGHT

NPW ISSUED FOR HIGHER TERRAIN OF E TN...SW VA AND SW NC AREAS...AND 
WILL ALSO CONSIDER UPDATING OUR SPS...OR HIGHLIGHT SEVERE THREAT FOR 
MONDAY IN THE HWO.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...EARLY MONDAY SHOWERS AND
POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA. STRONG
SOUTHWEST WINDS OF ABOUT 50 TO 60 KNOTS AT 850 MB WILL KEEP WIND
ADVISORY GOING THROUGH THE DAY. POSSIBLE EARLY MORNING SQUALL LINE
WILL BE MOVING THROUGH WEST TN. THIS FEATURE WILL LIKELY WEAKEN
DURING THE MORNING AS IT NEARS THE PLATEAU AND THEN REDEVELOP
BETWEEN 18 AND 00Z. DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE MAIN THREAT. NCEP
FORECASTING RAINFALL AMOUNTS FROM ONE HALF TO ONE INCH POSSIBLE
MONDAY. MONDAY NIGHT FRONT SHOULD BE EAST OF FORECAST AREA WITH
SHOWERS ENDING MAINLY BEFORE MIDNIGHT AND MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES.
A FEW SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE NE BEFORE PRECIPITATION ENDS. TUESDAY

WAS MOVING EAST AROUND 35 TO 40 MPH. TO OUR WEST...A NARROW BAND OF 
SHOWERS REVEALS THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT...WHICH WAS MOVING INTO

CEILINGS AND VISBYS INTO MVFR RANGE THIS MORNING...THEN TRENDING TO

MIGHT ALLOW PATCHY AREAS OF FOG TO DEVELOP.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
NORTHWEST TN...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT STRETCHING EAST ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY AND BISECTING THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH WINDS DUE 
TO MOUNTAIN WAVES ARE CURRENTLY BEING REPORTED AROUND THE 
FOOTHILLS...WITH THE COVE MTN FIRE TOWER REPORTING WIND GUSTS UP TO 
71 MPH AND CAMP CREEK GUSTING UP TO 54 MPH. EXPECT THESE HIGH WINDS 
TO INCREASE FURTHER THROUGH THE NIGHT...SINCE MODELS INDICATE A VERY 
STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 70 TO 80 KT) ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS IT 
MOVES EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. A SQUALL LINE OF CONVECTION 
WAS OCCURRING ALONG THE COLD FRONT OVER WEST TN...AND EXPECT THIS 
CONVECTIVE LINE TO CONTINUE ADVANCING EASTWARD INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA LATER TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODELS STILL INDICATE THAT 
INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAKENING OVERNIGHT...BUT STILL EXPECT SOME 
STORMS TO PRODUCE DAMAGING WINDS DUE TO THE STRONG UPPER-LEVEL WINDS 
ALONG THE COLD FRONT.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO TWEAK THE 
TEMPS AND PRECIP WORDING ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WARM FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH... 
GENERALLY STRETCHING FROM NEAR MEMPHIS SOUTHEASTWARD TO NEAR 
BIRMINGHAM AND SAVANNAH GA. A VERY DRY AIR MASS REMAINS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA...WITH LOCAL RADARS REVEALING ONLY VERY LIGHT SHOWERS 
WHICH ARE LIKELY EVAPORATING BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND. HOWEVER... 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN ARE LIKELY PRODUCING RAIN 
AT THE SURFACE...AND WILL LIKELY SPREAD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE NEXT FEW HOURS. OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT 
APPEARS TO GENERALLY BE ON TRACK.

THE MAIN CONCERN FOR TONIGHT INVOLVES THE APPROACH OF THE STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM ON THURSDAY NIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A 
SURFACE-BASED STABLE LAYER OVER THE MOUNTAINS AS SOUTHERLY WINDS 
INTENSIFIES THROUGHOUT THE DAY. A VERY STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 70 
TO 80 KT) IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER KY AFTER SUNSET THURSDAY 
NIGHT...WHICH WILL PRODUCE A GOOD SCENARIO FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
MOUNTAIN WAVES IN THE WESTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS. IN 
FACT...IT APPEARS THAT THIS COULD BE A HIGH END EVENT WITH WIND 
GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND THEIR ADJACENT 
FOOTHILLS. THUS...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A HIGH WIND WATCH FOR THESE 
AREAS BEGINNING LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND CONTINUING THROUGH 
FRIDAY MORNING.

FRONT MOVES NORTH THROUGH THE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY. UPPER HEIGHTS 
BUILD OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS STREAM ACROSS 
THE AREA. WENT ABOVE GUIDANCE ON MIN TEMPS TONIGHT. WEAK ISENTROPIC 
LIFT COULD BRING SOME PCPN INTO THE AREA MAINLY AFFECTING WESTERN 
AREA. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW INCREASES THROUGH THE LAYER THURSDAY AS 
UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. PWAT VALUES RISE TO NEAR
1.00 WHICH IS WELL ABOVE SEASONAL NORMAL. BEST UPPER LIFT WILL BE 
ALONG WARM FRONT WHICH IS PROGGED TO BE NORTHWEST OF MRX CWA. BEST 
FOCUS OF HEAVY RAIN SHOULD BE ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND KENTUCKY BUT 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL BE CLOSE TO THE ACTION AND SHIFT IN 
MODEL SOLUTION COULD RESULT IN A DETERIORATING FORECAST. SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORM THREAT FOR AREAS SW OF MRX CWA. VERY SMALL CHANCE THIS 
ACTIVITY COULD REACH SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AHEAD OF COLD FRONT 
LATE THURSDAY. INSTABILITY LIMITED AND SHEAR PARAMETERS DROP OFF AS 
DEEP CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA 
THURSDAY NIGHT. AGAIN SEVERE THREAT APPEARS LOW AT THIS TIME. PWAT 
VALUES PEAK NEAR 1.50 THURSDAY NIGHT WHICH IS VERY HIGH FOR THIS 
TIME OF YEAR. HEAVY RAINFALL LIKELY AS THE PREFRONTAL CONVECTION 
MOVES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. MINOR FLOODING IS POSSIBLE BUT MOST 
AREAS SHOULD BE ABLE TO RECEIVE EXPECTED RAINFALL AMOUNTS. FRONT 
MOVES THROUGH ON FRIDAY. BULK OF PCPN SHOULD MOVE OFF EARLY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE STEADY OF FALL BY FRIDAY AFTN.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ANOTHER POTENTIALLY 
SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM APPROACHES THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY 
LATE SUNDAY PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN 
TIMING PRECLUDE PINPOINTING EXACT ONSET AND DEPARTURE OF PRECIP 
ACCOMPANYING THIS SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. THUS HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE 
POPS FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY. ALSO INCLUDED SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDER IN THE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY PERIODS AS COLD FRONT MOVES

BACK TO NEAR CLIMO BY LATE IN THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY PASSING 
THROUGH EASTERN KY AND SW VA THIS AFTERNOON. A FEW SPRINKLES 
POSSIBLE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON SW VA OTHERWISE DRY FOR THE NEXT 24 
HOURS. HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND WEAK RIDGING ALOFT WILL 
ALLOW CLOUDS TO DECREASE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH TONIGHT. NE SECTIONS 
WILL HOLD ON TO CLOUDS FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT BEFORE CLEARING EARLY 
WEDNESDAY. LOWS MUCH COOLER TONIGHT NEAR TO JUST BELOW FREEZING. FOR 
WEDNESDAY SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY WITH TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES WARMER 
THAN TODAY MID 50S TO MID 60S. MAV TEMPS LOOK GOOD TONIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY SO FORECAST CLOSE TO THEM.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE COMING 
INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN 
THROUGH SATURDAY...BUT THEN BEGIN TO DIVERGE WITH THE EVOLUTION AND 
TIMING OF THE NEXT STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. A 
WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHWARD INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY 
LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...WITH MODELS IN AGREEMENT THAT A 
STRONG SOUTHERLY 850 MB WIND FLOW WILL DEVELOP AGAINST THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY AND PRODUCE THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. 
THERE REMAINS SOME DISAGREEMENTS AMONG THE MODELS WITH THE EXACT 
PLACEMENT OF THIS WARM FRONT ON THURSDAY...BUT WILL GENERALLY GO 
WITH LIKELY POPS AREAWIDE. BY THURSDAY NIGHT...A STRONG LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT LIKELY CREATING AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE TSTORMS 
OVER THE WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE TN RIVER VALLEY. WHILE THE MODELS 
AGREE THAT THE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL ONLY BE 
MARGINALLY UNSTABLE ON THURSDAY NIGHT (PARTIALLY ATTRIBUTED TO THE 
LATE ARRIVAL OF THE COLD FRONT AFTER MIDNIGHT)...A STRONG 850 MB 
WIND FLOW ALONG THE FRONT MAY STILL CREATE SOME STRONG WIND GUSTS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH THIS CONVECTIVE LINE. 

ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...AND THEN MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY. ECMWF AND GFS MODELS REVEAL SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES 
WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM...WITH THE GFS MODEL ALMOST 24 HOURS FASTER 
THAN THE ECMWF MODEL. BOTH MODELS AGREE THAT THIS SYSTEM COULD 
PRODUCE MORE INSTABILITY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY THAN THE FIRST 
SYSTEM...SO WILL MENTION TSTORMS FOR BOTH MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THE TIMING DIFFERENCES. A WARM FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH 
THIS SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA FIRST...SOMETIME 
AROUND SUNDAY OR SUNDAY NIGHT. THUS...WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS 
WEATHER OUTLOOK TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SEVERE 
TSTORMS WITH THE COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY NIGHT...AND WITH THE SYSTEM 
FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS OF THE ENSEMBLE MEANS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

IN ON THURSDAY WITH THE MAIN COLD FRONT REACHING INTO THE REGION FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT.  A STRONG 850MB JET WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT FOR 
SOME BREEZY CONDITIONS...AND A LITTLE THUNDER IS ALSO POSSIBLE.  A

FRONT.  CURRENT POPS LOOK GOOD. WINDS SHOULD ALSO DECREASE TONIGHT. 
TEMPERATURES AND THE REST ALSO ON TRACK. WILL UPDATE FORECAST TO 
REMOVE EVENING WORDING...NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...AT MID AFTERNOON SKIES WERE 
MOSTLY CLOUDY AND WARM WITH A STRONG SOUTHWEST WIND AREA WIDE. WINDS 
AVERAGED 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 35 MPH AND IN A FEW PLACES 
AROUND 40 MPH. THIS IS JUST BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. TEMPERATURES 
HAD CLIMBED TO THE UPPER 50S HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO UPPER 60S AND 
LOWER 70S VALLEYS...ONLY A FEW DEGREES BELOW RECORD HIGHS FOR THE 
DATE. COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH THE CLOSEST 
SHOWER ACTIVITY ACROSS NORTHERN AND WESTERN KY. LOWERED AFTERNOON 
RAIN CHANCES BUT LEFT HIGHER POPS IN TONIGHT AS SHOWERS SHOULD 
DEVELOP DURING THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. BEST 
CHANCE OF RAIN BETWEEN ABOUT 3 AND 12Z WITH SHOWERS EAST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. RAINFALL AMOUNTS STILL LIGHT 
MAINLY ONE QUARTER INCH OR LESS. WINDS EXPECTED TO STAY STRONG AHEAD 
OF FRONT AND THEN DECREASE BEHIND THE FRONT AFTER MIDNIGHT. WILL 
INCLUDE LATE AFTERNOON WORDING WITH WINDS GUSTING TO 35 MPH UNTIL 
SUNSET. LOWS TONIGHT MOSTLY MID 40S TO LOWER 50S. HIGHS TUESDAY AS 
SKIES CLEAR ABOUT 10 DEGREES COOLER...STILL A A FEW DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL FOR LATE FEBRUARY.      

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES DURING THE EXTENDED FORECAST WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE 
LARGE-SCALE PATTERN...BUT GENERALLY AGREE THAT AN ACTIVE PATTERN 
WILL DEVELOP THIS WEEK WITH TWO SYSTEMS AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA 
AROUND THE THURSDAY/FRIDAY AND SUNDAY/MONDAY TIME FRAMES. IT APPEARS 
THAT THE FIRST SYSTEM COULD PRODUCE AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE TSTORMS 
OVER WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY...WITH THIS 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY THEN LIKELY CONGEALING INTO A LINE AS IT MOVES 
EASTWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT. GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS AGREE THAT A MORE STABLE AIR MASS WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT...SO EXPECT THIS CONVECTION TO WEAKEN 
AS IT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...A STRONG 850 MB JET 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA MAY STILL CREATE SOME STRONG WIND GUSTS WITH 
THIS CONVECTIVE LINE. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL MENTION A CHANCE FOR 
TSTORMS ON THURSDAY NIGHT WITH THE COLD FRONT. THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON 
SUNDAY...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA AROUND SUNDAY NIGHT. THE LATEST ECMWF MODEL RUN INDICATES THAT 
THIS SYSTEM COULD PRODUCE MORE INSTABILITY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
THAN THE FIRST SYSTEM...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION SHOWERS SINCE 
THE GFS MODEL REVEALS A WEAKER SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. AS FOR TEMPS...

VALLEYS THIS MORNING. ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TEMPERATURES HAD A
WARM START AND ARE ALREADY IN THE MID 50S TO MID 60S THIS MORNING.
WINDS FROM THE SOUTHWEST ARE ABOUT 15 TO 25 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS
ESPECIALLY AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BUT SHOULD DECREASE DURING THE
DAY BEFORE RISING AGAIN TONIGHT JUST AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. SKIES ARE
PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY NOW AND WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLOUDY BY
AFTERNOON ALL AREAS. REMOVED RAIN CHANCES FOR ALL BUT NORTHERN
SECTIONS THIS MORNING AND KEPT MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE THIS AFTERNOON.
WILL WAIT UNTIL NEXT HOURS TEMPERATURES BEFORE DECIDING WHETHER TO
RAISE HIGH TEMPERATURES A FEW MORE DEGREES. SOME LOCATIONS MAY
REACH LOWER 70S.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL 
SWING ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT.  MOISTURE AND LIFT DO NOT LOOK ALL 
THAT IMPRESSIVE WITH THIS SYSTEM...SO WILL GO HIGHER THAN MAV POPS...BUT 
STILL KEEP POPS IN THE 50 TO 70 RANGE FOR TONIGHT.  LOOKS LIKE BULK 
OF PRECIP WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL TONIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE 
TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  LOW LEVEL JET FORECAST TO 
WEAKEN A BIT FOR TODAY...SO WILL NOT ISSUE ANY WIND ADVISORY AT THIS 
TIME.  HOWEVER...GUSTY SOUTHWEST WINDS CAN BE EXPECTED. WILL TWEAK 
TEMPS A BIT HIGHER THAN MAV NUMBERS MOST LOCATIONS FOR TODAY...BUT NO 
ARGUMENTS WITH MAV LOWS TONIGHT.     

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...GENERALLY FAST ZONAL FLOW
WILL BE THE RULE DURING THE EXTENDED. A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. AFTER TODAY'S SYSTEM...NEXT WAVE
WILL PULL EAST THROUGH THE AREA THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. FRONTAL
PASSAGE EXPECTED FRIDAY WITH FAIRLY STRONG UPPER DYNAMICS
ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER JET AND FRONTOGENETIC FORCING. HAVE INCLUDED
ISOLATED THUNDER. ANOTHER SYSTEM WILL QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE AREA BY
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS...POSSIBLY
THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE SUNDAY NIGHT AS DYNAMICS WILL ALSO BE STRONG.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...FOLLOWED GFS MEX MOS CLOSELY.

.DISCUSSION...SEEING ISOLATED STRONG GUSTY WINDS IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. WILL CHANGE WINDS ON A FEW GROUPS. TEMPERATURES AND THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
A WARM FRONT TO THE SOUTH AND WEST HAS BEEN MAKING SLOW NORTH AND 
EASTWARD PROGRESS...AND WILL MOVE INTO OUR AREA OVERNIGHT. MODELS 
HAVE BEEN TO FAST TO BRING THE FRONT NORTH...BUT WE SHOULD BEGIN TO 
SEE RISING DEWPOINTS AND POSSIBLY RISING TEMPS AFTER MIDNIGHT. A LOW 
LEVEL JET WILL STRENGTHEN OVERNIGHT AS LOW PRESSURE TRACKS INTO THE 
UPPER MS VALLEY. THE NAM HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY STRONGER WITH THE 850 
MB JET BY ABOUT 10 KTS THAN THE GFS. SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
WILL APPROACH WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA...BUT THE WIND DIRECTION ALOFT 
WILL BE SOUTHWEST AND NOT IDEAL FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES. WILL LEAN TOWARD 
THE GFS WINDS AND NOT ISSUE AN ADVISORY AT THE MOMENT. WE SHOULD 
STAY DRY UNTIL GREATER LIFT FOR RAIN SHOWERS COMES MONDAY AFTERNOON 
AS THE UPPER JET SHIFTS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. MOISTURE IS CONFINED 
TO A SHALLOW LAYER WITH DRY AIR ABOVE 700 MB...SO ANY PRECIP WILL BE 
LIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
SHORT RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO BRING FRONTAL SYSTEM TOWARDS THE 
FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT WITH LOW LEVEL WINDS INCREASING AGAIN 
WITH THE FRONT SHIFTING FROM THE SOUTHWEST TO WEST MONDAY NIGHT AND 
EARLY TUESDAY. 850 MB WINDS ARE AROUND 50 KNOTS SO HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
MAY REQUIRE A WIND ADVISORY MONDAY NIGHT. BEST RAIN CHANCES MONDAY 
NIGHT WITH LIKELY FOR A TIME. RAINFALL AMOUNTS LOOK TO BE AROUND ONE 
QUARTER INCH OR LESS AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH. LOWS MONDAY NIGHT 
STILL MILD MAINLY 40S TO NEAR 50. COLD AIR ADVECTION STRONGER WITH 
NAM THAN GFS TUESDAY WITH PRECIPITATION ENDING IN THE MORNING. 
FOLLOWED CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM NUMBERS BUT DEPENDS ON HOW FAST 
SKIES CLEAR AND WINDS DIE DOWN. HIGH PRESSURE WILL LAST ABOUT 24 TO 
36 HOURS BEFORE NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES. UPPER TROUGH ACROSS WESTERN 
STATES BRINGS IN COLDER TEMPERATURES THERE AT MID WEEK BUT TO THE 
EAST RIDGING OVER THE GULF KEEPS TEMPERATURES MILD ACROSS THE TN 
VALLEY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. MODELS FASTER THAN YESTERDAY WITH NEW 
SYSTEM THURSDAY AS LOW DEVELOPS ACROSS SOUTHERN PLAINS AND OVER THE 
GREAT LAKES. WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION OVER THE SOUTHEAST RAIN TO 
SPREAD INTO THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY. DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE AREA 
IS PROGGED TO MOVE BY TO THE NORTH AND WEST THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
FRIDAY. THIS SHOULD BRING A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF RAIN TO THE 
REGION. DRYING CONDITIONS SATURDAY AND ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVING IN 
SUNDAY.

SCATTER OUT THE CLOUDS. SOME MODELS INDICATE AN MVFR CEILING
DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT...OTHERS DO NOT. IF THIS DOES HAPPEN...IT IS
MOST LIKELY TO OCCUR AT CHA...BUT WILL JUST MENTION SCATTERED
CLOUDS AROUND 3 KFT FOR NOW AS CONFIDENCE IS LOW. LLWS WILL BE
POSSIBLE TONIGHT AS WELL...BUT THE SURFACE TO 2 KFT WIND SPEED
DIFFERENCE LOOKS MARGINAL FOR LLWS...SO WILL LEAVE IT OUT FOR NOW.

RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS CENTRAL AND EASTERN KY ASSOCIATED WTIH AN AREA
OF ISENTROPIC LIFT ARE MOVING E-NE AND SHOULD REMAIN JUST NORTH OF

ON RADAR OVER OUR AREA ARE NOT REACHING THE GROUND...AND MODEL
SOUNDINGS INDICATE DRY LOW LEVEL AIR THROUGH THE DAY. A FRONT
REMAINS WELL TO OUR SOUTH...ACROSS SRN GA AND CNTL AL AND WEST TN.
THE NAM SEEMS TOO QUICK TO BRING THE FRONT NORTH...THE RUC KEEPS IT
NEARLY STATIONARY. WITH THE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND THE WARM
FRONT STAYING SOUTH...TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS WILL NEED A SLIGHT
DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENT FOR THE MORNING UPDATE.

350 AM EST SUN FEB 20 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR NORTH WILL 
SHIFT SOUTHEAST...ALLOWING WINDS TO TURN MORE SOUTHWESTERLY AND 
MOISTURE TO INCREASE.  SHOULD SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS...AND MAY 
EVEN BE A FEW SHOWERS WESTERN AND NORTHERN ZONES LATE TONIGHT.  LOW 
LEVEL JET WILL INCREASE...AND WINDS MAY BE CLOSE TO WIND ADVISORY 
CRITERIA OVER A SOME OF THE HIGHER MOUNTAINS TONIGHT...BUT GIVEN 
POOR MODEL AGREEMENT ON STRENGTH OF LOW LEVEL JET WILL NOT ISSUE ANY 
WIND ADVISORY AT THIS TIME.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE 
ONCE AGAIN...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.    

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAKENING SHORT WAVE TROF 
WILL BE GLIDING FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES 
MONDAY INTO TUESDAY WHILE ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW MAKES ITS WAY EAST 
THROUGH THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY. COOLER AIR WILL SPILL SOUTH TOWARD 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION REQUIRING CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AS 
MOISTURE IS LIFTED AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THE BEST CHANCE FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS WILL BE MONDAY NIGHT AND KEPT LIKELY POPS FOR 
THE LIGHT RAIN EVENT. THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW WEAK TRAILING 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND AN INVERTED SURFACE TROF ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR TUESDAY WHICH WOULD IMPACT MAINLY 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THEREFORE 
MAINTAINED SLIGHT AND SMALL CHANCE POPS FOR A LIGHT SHOWER PRIMARILY 
DURING THE MORNING ON TUESDAY. UPPER LEVEL RIDGING BUILDS EAST FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE EARLY WEEK SHORT WAVE...WAS 
ABLE TO KEEP THE DRY FORECAST FOR TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. THE NEXT UPPER TROF SWINGS OUT INTO THE MIDWEST ON THURSDAY 
WITH INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT SO STAYED 
WITH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS AT THIS TIME STEP WHILE MAINTAINING A HIGH 
CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT AS A RELATIVELY STRONG COLD 
FRONT PRESSES THROUGH THE MID SOUTH ON ITS WAY TOWARD THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. APPARENTLY THIS BOUNDARY DOES NOT SHIFT SOUTH 
AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL LATER FRIDAY NIGHT SO KEPT THE 
MEDIUM AND LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY OF PRECIP GOING HERE WHILE STAYING 
WITH A DRY SATURDAY BEHIND THIS FEATURE.

.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS EVENING. SHORTWAVE PROVIDING 
CLOUD COVER BUT NO PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED. TEMPERATURES AND THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. NO CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
THE EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TONIGHT AND SUNDAY WILL BRING INCREASING 
SOUTHERLY COMPONENT TO THE LOW LEVEL FLOW. AS A RESULT...THE FRONT 
THAT HAS STALLED TO OUR SOUTH WILL LIFT BACK TO THE NORTH AS A WARM 
FRONT TOMORROW. THE 850 MB RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS TO THE ATLANTIC 
COAST...AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL SPREAD CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA FROM 
SOUTH TO NORTH FROM LATE TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING. THIS WILL 
MAKE FOR A TRICKY TEMPERATURE FORECAST...BUT WILL LEAN A BIT ABOVE 
MOS GUIDANCE FOR LOWS TONIGHT AND HIGHS TOMORROW. THE LIFT LOOKS TOO 
WEAK AND MOISTURE TOO SHALLOW TO PRODUCE ANY PRECIP. ON SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS AS A LOW TRACKS INTO MO/IA. 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL BE BREEZY TOMORROW AS 925 MB WINDS INCREASE 
TO 25-30 KTS IN THE NAM IN WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...BUT SHOULD 
STAY BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA DURING THE DAY. VALLEY WINDS IN THE LEE 
OF THE MOUNTAINS SHOULD BE CONSIDERABLY LIGHTER WITH CLOUD COVER 
LIMITING DOWNWARD MIXING OF WINDS ALOFT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
WINDS INCREASE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY FROM THE SOUTHWEST AS LOW 
PRESSURE MOVES FROM THE MID MS VALLEY THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND 
OHIO VALLEY TO THE MID ATLANTIC. HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST STATES. MAY NEED WIND ADVISORY FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS BY 
SUNDAY EVENING THROUGH MONDAY. USED MODIFIED NAM WINDS IN THE 
GRIDDED FORECAST. WITH WEAK WARM FRONT MOVING NORTH OF FORECAST AREA 
SUNDAY NIGHT SHOWERS MAY DEVELOP LATE ACROSS THE NW AS RIDGING HOLDS 
ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. WINDS WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES UP IN THE 40S 
TO NEAR 50. MONDAY TEMPERATURES AGAIN WILL BE MILD. SHOWERS WILL 
MOVE IN GRADUALLY FROM THE NW. WINDS SHOULD DECREASE MONDAY NIGHT 
AND BECOME NW BEHIND COLD FRONT. TEMPERATURES MUCH COOLER TUESDAY 
AND SKIES CLEARING AS HIGH PRESSURE TAKES CONTROL FROM THE NW. 
THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY A NEW LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MOVES EAST. UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH OVER THE 
WESTERN STATES. THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO PRODUCE MORE RAINFALL AND TAKE 
A COUPLE DAYS TO MOVE THROUGH. THERE COULD BE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AS AIRMASS BECOMES SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE. 
WILL NOT INCLUDE INTO FORECAST JUST YET.

TO NEAR 50. MONDAY TEMPERATURES AGAIN WILL BE MILD. SHOWERS WILL 
MOVE IN GRADUALLY FROM THE NW. WINDS SHOULD DECREASE MONDAY NIGHT 
AND BECOME NW BEHIND COLD FRONT. TEMPERATURES MUCH COOLER TUESDAY 
AND SKIES CLEARING AS HIGH PRESSURE TAKES CONTROL FROM THE NW. 
THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY A NEW LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MOVES EAST. UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH OVER THE 
WESTERN STATES. THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO PRODUCE MORE RAINFALL AND TAKE 
A COUPLE DAYS TO MOVE THROUGH. THERE COULD BE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT AS AIRMASS BECOMES SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE. 
WILL NOT INCLUDE INTO FORECAST JUST YET.

.DISCUSSION...
A COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED SOUTH OF THE AREA WHILE HIGH PRESSURE IS
BUILDING IN FROM THE NORTH...BRINGING VERY DRY AIR TO THE REGION.
THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN TODAY IS RELATIVE HUMIDITY...WHICH WILL
BOTTOM OUT IN THE TEENS IN NORTHERN SECTIONS AS DRIER AIR ALOFT
MIXES DOWN TO THE SURFACE...ENHANCING THE FIRE DANGER TODAY. MANY
LOCATIONS ALREADY ARE SEEING RH VALUES IN THE 20% RANGE. WINDS WILL
GENERALLY BE BETWEEN 6 AND 12 MPH...WITH THE HIGHER WIND SPEEDS IN
THAT RANGE BEING IN SW VA WHERE DEWPOINTS WILL BE LOWEST. WILL
EXPAND THE FIRE DANGER SPS TO INCLUDE THE SMOKIES. WILL UPDATE THE
TEMP/DEWPOINT GRIDS BASED ON LATEST OBS...BUT NO SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES ARE NEEDED TO THE ZONE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK COLD FRONT HAS SAGGED TO 
OUR SOUTH...BUT WILL BEGIN MOVING BACK NORTH AS A WARM FRONT 
TONIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND INTO OUR AREA FROM THE NORTH 
TODAY.  SHOULD SEE QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE TODAY...ESPECIALLY NORTH 
AND INTO CENTRAL AREAS...BUT CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AGAIN 
LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT.  WITH DRYER AIR MOVING IN TODAY AND MILD 
TEMPS...WILL SEE VERY LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES...SO WILL 
CONTINUE SPS FOR FIRE DANGER.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE 
SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS RELATIVELY SIMILAR 
DURING MUCH OF THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...SOLUTIONS DIVERGE BY 
THURSDAY/FRIDAY SO USED A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF AT 
THIS TIME. HEALTHY SHORT WAVE TROF WITH SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
ADVANCES NORTHEAST FROM THE WESTERN PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST ON 
SUNDAY WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION STRENGTHENING ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
EASTERN U.S. AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR SUNDAY IN AREA 
OF DEEPER MOISTURE AND STRONGER ISENTROPIC LIFT. THE UPPER TROF WILL 
CONTINUE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WHILE DRAGGING A SURFACE 
LOW THROUGH THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY. MOISTURE ADVECTION/CONVERGENCE 
INCREASES AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND 
GRADUALLY INCREASE THE PROBABILITY OF PRECIP FROM CHANCE ON MONDAY 
TO LIKELY MONDAY NIGHT AS SYSTEM COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. MAINTAINED SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS 
FOR A SHOWER MAINLY TUESDAY MORNING AS WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY TRAILS 
BEHIND THE MAIN SYSTEM. KEPT THE PERIOD TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY BASICALLY DRY AS HIGHER PRESSURES MOVE IN FOR A PLEASANT 
MID WEEK PERIOD. THE NEXT SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE NORTHEAST OUT OF THE 
SOUTHWEST U.S. THURSDAY AND WILL ARRIVE IN THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY BY  
MID DAY FRIDAY. GRADUALLY RAISED POPS FROM SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE 
LATER THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT TO MEDIUM CHANCE BY 
FRIDAY AS THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT BUILDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS WERE NOT FAR FROM THE PREVIOUS LONG TERM

A COLD FRONT LOCATED OVER NORTHERN KY THIS AFTERNOON WILL PUSH INTO

MOVING SOUTHEAST...SO A LOW CHANCE POP WILL BE KEPT ACROSS THE AREA 
THIS EVENING WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH AFTER MIDNIGHT. A ZONAL FLOW

JUST A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH EXPECTED. THE SURFACE FRONT WILL 
PUSH SOUTH OF THE AREA SATURDAY MORNING. HOWEVER THE 850 MB THETA-E 
GRADIENT REMAINS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY TOMORROW...SO 
NORTHERN SECTIONS WILL LIKELY BE SUNNY WITH SOUTHERN AREAS BEING 
MOSTLY CLOUDY. RELATIVE HUMIDITIES IN THE TEENS AND WINDS IN THE 
10-15 MPH RANGE WILL RESULT IN AN ENHANCED FIRE DANGER RISK IN 
NORTHERN SECTIONS TOMORROW AFTERNOON. AFTER CONSULTING WITH VA AND 
TN FORESTRY...A SPS WILL BE ISSUED TO ADDRESS THIS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
RIDGING AHEAD OF NEXT DEVELOPING SYSTEM IN THE PLAINS WILL KEEP AREA 
DRY SATURDAY NIGHT AND JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS SUNDAY AS 
WARM FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. MOST OF THE AREA WILL BE DRY BUT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
A COLD FRONT WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA IN THE SHORT TERM...MAINLY 
BETWEEN FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND MIDNIGHT. AN EAST-WEST RIDGE AXIS 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST WILL PREVENT DEEP MOISTURE FROM MAKING ITS WAY 
INTO THE TN VALLEY. IN ADDITION...WITH A ZONAL FLOW IN THE UPPER 
LEVELS AND THE UPPER JET POSITION WELL TO THE NORTH...FORCING FOR 
LIFT WILL BE MAINLY IN THE LOW LEVELS BELOW 700 MB. THIS SHOULD 
RESULT IN JUST LIGHT PRECIP AND CHANCE POPS FRIDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. BEST CHANCES WILL BE NORTH AS THE MODELS SHOW WEAKENING LIFT 
AS THE FRONT PUSHES SOUTH. THE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH MOVES THROUGH 
FRIDAY EVENING...WITH THE SURFACE FRONT MOVING THROUGH LATE FRIDAY 
NIGHT. TEMPERATURES AHEAD OF THE FRONT TOMORROW SHOULD WARM UP 
NICELY BEFORE CLOUDS INCREASE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...REACHING 
BETWEEN 65 AND 70 IN MOST SPOTS. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
SATURDAY WILL BE A BRIEF DRY PERIOD WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
EASTERN STATES. WARM AIR ADVECTION AHEAD OF THE DEPARTING FRONT WILL 
BRING SHOWERS BACK INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS SUNDAY AND THEN AS A 
DEEPENING AREA OF LOW PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY MONDAY 
MORE SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP IN THE MILD AIRMASS AHEAD OF THE SLOW 
MOVING COLD FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MUCH COOLER TUESDAY WITH 
LINGERING SHOWERS AS A LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES ALONG THE FRONT AND 
PASSES INTO NC. MOSTLY SUNNY AND DRY WEDNESDAY AND STAYING COOLER OR 
NEAR NORMAL. A NEW DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW OVER THE PLAINS STATES 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WILL SPREAD MOISTURE IN THE FORM OF 
LIGHT SHOWERS THURSDAY AND INCREASING BY THURSDAY NIGHT.

FRONT BY SUNDAY...AS DEEP SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW DEVELOPS OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS. WILL INTRODUCE SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY 
AND SUNDAY NIGHT...SINCE THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS INDICATE SOME VERY 
LIGHT PRECIP DUE TO WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
MODELS SHOW THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BECOMING ELONGATED OVER THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON MONDAY...AND THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS BEGIN TO 
DIVERGE SOMEWHAT WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THE LOW DURING THIS PERIOD. 
HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THAT A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY ON MONDAY...AND MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY 
NIGHT...BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL

COLD FRONT. COORDINATED WITH FORESTRY OFFICIALS AND ADJACENT NWS

COUNTIES OF NC...AND AN SPS AGAIN TO HIGHLIGHT THE THREAT FOR OUR
TN AND SW VA DISTRICTS. 

MODELS PUSH DEW POINT TEMPS UP A BIT ON MONDAY AHEAD OF THIS FRONT 
BUT MIXING OUT LIKE MANY AREAS TODAY...COULD LEAD TO A FEW SPOTS
FALLING TO OR BELOW MIN RH CRITERIA. EXPECT SUSTAINED WIND SPEEDS
AS HIGH OR HIGHER THAN TODAY...WITH GUSTS TO AT LEAST 35 MPH
POSSIBLE. 

OTHERWISE...WINDS STAY UP TONIGHT AND AFFECT MINS TEMPS...SO
TRENDED TOWARD A BLEND OF MOS MINS. EXPECT WARM TEMPS AGAIN AHEAD
OF THE FRONT ON MONDAY...SO ANOTHER BLEND OR WARMER MOS CHOICE WAS
BEST. WINDS DIMINISH MONDAY NIGHT AND WE EXPERIENCE DRY AND
PLEASANT CONDITIONS...WITH SURFACE HIGH AND UPPER RIDGE IN CONTROL.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WEAK SHORT WAVE 
CROSSES THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY WITH LITTLE FANFARE FOLLOWED 
BY A PERIOD OF RISING HEIGHTS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW 
FOR A CONTINUATION OF RATHER PLEASANT WEATHER WHICH FEATURES ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES WITH LITTLE CHANCE OF ANY PRECIPITATION. BY 
SATURDAY THE PATTERN STARTS TO BREAK DOWN AS AN UPPER TROF SHIFTS 
STEADILY EAST ACROSS THE MIDWEST AND NORTHEASTERN U.S. AS THIS 
HAPPENS A COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MAKE ITS WAY SLOWLY SOUTH INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY BEFORE STALLING OUT ON SUNDAY ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH. MOISTURE CONVERGENCE WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA IN 
THE VICINITY OF THE FRONT LEADING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWER.

240 AM EST SUN FEB 13 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE GULF COAST...WITH A 
LEE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
A BROAD LOW PRESSURE AREA IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION TODAY...INCREASING THE PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. AS A RESULT...SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL BECOME GUSTY THIS 
AFTERNOON AND WILL BRING ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS UNDER FULL SUNSHINE. 
THESE WARMER TEMPS WILL RESULT IN LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITIES THIS 
AFTERNOON AS THE WINDS BECOME GUSTY...SO WILL REISSUE THE SPECIAL 
WEATHER STATEMENT TO ADDRESS THE INCREASED FIRE DANGER. THIS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION WILL BRING A WEAK COLD 
FRONT TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE TONIGHT...WITH ONLY A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER EXPECTED. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL TREND A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN BOTH SINCE THIS 
HAS BEEN THE VERIFYING TREND LATELY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES CONTINUE 
TO DEPICT GENERALLY DRY AND PLEASANT WEATHER CONDITIONS THROUGH THE 
LONG TERM. A WEAK NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE AND SURFACE COLD FRONT 
WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION LATE MONDAY...BUT THIS FEATURE HAS 
VIRTUALLY NO MOISTURE TO WORK WITH PER MODEL TIME HEIGHTS. ANOTHER 
SHORT WAVE PASSES THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY BUT AGAIN HAS VIRTUALLY NO 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT. SIGNIFICANT UPPER RIDGE STILL PROJECTED 
TO BUILD INTO THE REGION BY LATE IN THE WORK WEEK...ASSURING TEMPS 
WILL REMAIN WELL ABOVE CLIMO. FOR TEMPS...TENDED TO FAVOR WARMER MET 
GUIDANCE EARLY IN THE LONG TERM BEFORE GENERALLY STAYING CLOSE TO 
MEX GUIDANCE LATER IN THE LONG TERM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
WEDNESDAY'S AND FRIDAY'S MAX TEMPS WHICH WERE BUMPED UP SLIGHTLY 
BASED ON ENSEMBLE TRENDS.

.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS 
THE AREA BRINGING DRY WEATHER WITH JUST A FEW HIGH CLOUDS PASSING 
OVER. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK...NO 
CHANGES NEEDED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...NOT A LOT TO DISCUSS FOR 
THESE PERIODS AS DRY WEATHER CONTINUES AND TEMPS WARM. LOW CLOUDS 
OVER SE KY AND SW VA HAVE DRIFTED EAST AND DISSIPATED...LEAVING 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. MAY SEE SOME HIGH CLOUDS PASS ACROSS NRN AREAS 
OVERNIGHT...AND WINDS MAY NOT DE-COUPLE COMPLETELY WITH SURFACE HIGH 
CENTERED TO OUR SOUTH. THUS...I FAVORED A BLEND OF MOS MINS OVER 
COOLER LOWS. OTHERWISE...WARMER MOS HIGHS WERE MORE CLOSELY FOLLOWED 
EACH DAY...AND A BLEND OF MOS AGAIN FOR SUNDAY NIGHT.

MAIN CONCERN SUNDAY IS THE DRY CONDITIONS WITH BREEZY WESTERLY
WINDS...WITH STRONGEST WINDS LIKELY OVER SW VA...NRN MTNS OF E TN
AND SMOKY MTNS. THIS WILL CREATE AN INCREASED FIRE DANGER...WITH
THE LIMITING FACTOR BEING WHERE DEW POINTS MIX OUT TO IN THE
AFTERNOON. MOS PUSHES DEW POINT TEMPS UP BY 5 TO 10 DEGREES FROM
TODAY...WHICH WOULD KEEP MINIMUM RH VALUES ABOVE CRITERIA FOR A RED
FLAG WARNING. 

AFTER COORDINATION WITH VA AND TN FORESTRY DISTRICTS...WILL ISSUE
AN SPS FOR FIRE DANGER ON SUNDAY. GREATEST THREAT SEEMS TO BE SW VA
NRN MTNS AND SMOKY MTNS FOR NOW.  


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE BUILDS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE PERIOD WITH INDICATION OF A VERY 
WEAK WAVE ON WEDNESDAY THAT MAY BRING A FEW CIRRUS CLOUDS TO THE 
AREA. OTHERWISE...THE AMPLIFIED PATTERN ALLOWS THE EASTERN U.S. TO 
ENJOY A FAIR WEATHER RIDGE RIGHT INTO THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEKEND. 
THE GFS INDICATES THAT A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE TOWARD THE AREA FRIDAY 
NIGHT INTO SATURDAY BRINGING AN END TO THE STRING OF FAIR WEATHER 
DAYS. HOWEVER...DISCARDED THIS IDEA IN FAVOR OF THE ECMWF SOLUTION 
WHICH IS SLOWER TO BRING A THREAT OF RAIN TO THE AREA. ADJUSTED 
TEMPS ABOVE GUIDANCE NUMBERS IN THE AMPLIFIED PATTERN.

.DISCUSSION...WEATHER DEFINITELY CONTINUES TO TREND IN THE RIGHT 
DIRECTION...DRY WITH WARMING TEMPERATURES. WESTERLY WINDS AND 
SUNSHINE WILL HELP CONSIDERABLY TODAY...ALTHOUGH CLOUDS OVER SE KY 
INTO SW VA MAY LINGER THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 12Z RNK 
SOUNDING SHOWS THIS MOISTURE TO BE TRAPPED BELOW AN INVERSION...
SO CLOUDS MAY STAY BROKEN IN COVERAGE...AND SOMEWHAT LIMIT SUNSHINE 
IN THOSE AREAS.

OTHERWISE...FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK OVERALL...BUT HOURLY TEMPS MAY 
BE DRIFTING OFF ENOUGH TO UPDATE A FEW GRIDS LATE THIS MORNING.

FOR SUNDAY...LOOKS LIKE MAXIMUM SUNSHINE AND STRONGER WESTERLY 
WINDS...WHICH COULD BE A CONCERN FOR INCREASED FIRE DANGER. LIMITING 
FACTOR WOULD APPEAR TO BE MINIMUM RH VALUES IN THE AFTERNOON...AS
DEW POINT TEMPS ARE PROGGED TO INCREASE INTO THE UPPER TEENS AND

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEY...EXTENDING NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY REVEALS SOME MID-LEVEL CLOUDS OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. MOST OF THE 
CLOUDINESS WITH THIS SHORT WAVE SHOULD STAY NORTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY...BUT WILL BE A LITTLE MORE PESSIMISTIC WITH CLOUD COVER 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BRING DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS THROUGH TONIGHT. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY...AND WILL TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER NAM NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT 
SINCE THIS HAS BEEN THE VERIFYING TREND LATELY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...LONG TERM STILL APPEARS 
GENERALLY DRY WITH MODERATING TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD PER MODEL AND 
ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. THERE ARE A FEW WEAK SHORT WAVES WHICH WILL 
APPROACH THE REGION FROM TIME TO TIME...BUT NONE OF THESE APPEAR 
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO WARRANT MENTION OF POPS. MODEL AGREEMENT 
DETERIORATES BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM WITH RESPECT TO UPPER FLOW 
PATTERN WITH THE ECMWF MODEL BUILDING AN IMPRESSIVE RIDGE OVER THE 
EASTERN CONUS WITH HEIGHTS RISING TO VALUES MORE TYPICAL OF LATE 
SPRING. THE GFS MAINTAINS A MORE OR LESS ZONAL FLOW WITH LESS 
MAGNITUDE IN HEIGHT RISES. THE OPERATION GFS REPRESENTS THE COOLEST 
ENSEMBLE MEMBER HOWEVER...THUS BUMPED UP THE MEX GUIDANCE TEMPS 
A FEW DEGREES FOR NEXT FRIDAY. EVEN THAT MAY BE TOO COOL IF THE 
ECMWF VERIFIES. ALSO TENDED TO FAVOR WARMER MET GUIDANCE FOR MONDAY.

WEAK WESTERLY. THUS...ONLY CLOUDS ANTICIPATED OVERNIGHT WILL BE HIGH

BASED ON MOS SLIGHT COOL BIAS LAST NIGHT AND A FEW CLOUDS NORTH...
I TRENDED MORE WITH A MOS BLEND FOR TONIGHT'S MINS. 850 MB TEMPS
WARM THROUGH THE PERIOD AND WE SHOULD EASILY REACH THE WARMER MOS
HIGHS BY SUNDAY. OTHERWISE...MOS WAS CLOSE FOR SATURDAY HIGHS AND I
TRENDED TOWARD THE MILDER MOS MINS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...AS 850 MB
TEMPS WARM AND A SW-W LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THERE WILL BE A FINAL 
UPPER TROF PASSAGE EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING 
WITH A DRY COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE WHICH WILL KEEP THE FORECAST AREA IN 
A HOLDING PATTERN CONCERNING TEMPERATURES ON MONDAY. HOWEVER...THE 
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST GENERALLY FEATURES GRADUALLY BUILDING 
HEIGHTS. RIDGING AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL ALLOW FOR A VERY 
PLEASANT WARMUP THROUGH THE WEEK. HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD MAKE IT 
INTO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 60S BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS SOUTHERLY 
WINDS STRENGTHEN ON THE BACK SIDE OF A WESTERN ATLANTIC SURFACE 
HIGH. THE STORM TRACK WILL REMAIN TO THE NORTHWEST DURING THE LONG 
TERM WHICH WILL KEEP THE FORECAST DRY WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE

APART IN DEPICTION OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. AN UPPER TROF AMPLIFIES 
TO SOME DEGREE AS IT SHIFTS SOUTHEAST FROM THE GREAT LAKES ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. A COLD FRONT WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE SYSTEM CROSSING THE FORECAST AREA LATER SUNDAY NIGHT 
INTO MONDAY MORNING...HOWEVER MODELS INDICATE VERY LITTLE MOISTURE 
WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR LIFTING SO KEPT A FEW CLOUDS IN BUT STAYED 
WITH A DRY FORECAST HERE. COOL HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BEHIND THIS 
FEATURE FOR TUESDAY AND THEN WARMING GETS UNDERWAY BY WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY AS THE UPPER FLOW MAKES A GRADUAL TRANSITION TO

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN WEATHER EVENT IS
STILL ON TAP FOR TONIGHT...AS UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES.
MUCH OF THE SNOW BAND FOR TODAY TO OUR W AND NW APPEARS TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LEVEL JET DYNAMICS. THIS JET SUPPORT SEEMS TO
MOVE MAINLY ACROSS OUR NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES OVER SE KY AND SW VA
OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...A BROAD AREA OF FORCING AND DIVERGENCE ALOFT
DOES DEVELOP OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA BY 03Z TO 09Z THURSDAY.
SOME LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE IS SUGGESTED OVER MAINLY SE TN INTO WRN
NC OVERNIGHT...WITH AT LEAST WEAK FRONTOGENESIS DEVELOPING IN THOSE
AREAS. 

THUS...OVERALL THE PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS AND WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY AREAS APPEARED TO BE ON TRACK...WITH JUST A TWEAK OR TWO
ON SNOW AMOUNTS AND AN INCREASE IN POPS UP TO NEAR 100 PERCENT.
SO...KEPT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS BELOW WARNING CRITERIA...WITH A BRIEF
MELT POSSIBLE EARLY THIS EVENING...BEFORE THE DRY LOW LEVELS COOL
AND SATURATE. COLD AIR ALOFT WILL PROVIDE GOOD SNOW GROWTH...BUT A
FAST TRACK EASTWARD LIMITS HOW LONG THE SNOW LASTS.

FOR THURSDAY...ACCEPTING A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION WHICH ABUNDANT
SUNSHINE WILL LIKELY MELT AWAY...SO TRENDED TOWARD COOLER HIGHS.
CHILLY THURSDAY NIGHT WITH TEMPS TO BEGIN A RECOVERY ON FRIDAY. 
GRIDS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WERE ON TRACK...AND CHANGED
VERY LITTLE FOR NOW. 


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING 
INTO THE AREA BRINGING MOSTLY DRY WEATHER FOR THE PERIOD. MODELS 
INDICATING A FEW RIPPLES RIDING OVER THE RIDGE ACROSS THE NORTHERN

300 AM EST WED FEB 9 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE HIGH PLAINS AND EXTENDING 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH A DEVELOPING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER SOUTH TEXAS. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE ALONG THE GULF COASTAL REGION TODAY...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED MOISTURE SPREADING NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY 
LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT AROUND A TENTH TO POSSIBLY TWO-TENTHS OF AN INCH OF LIQUID- 
EQUIVALENT PRECIP SHOULD AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING... 
WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN ONE TO TWO INCHES OF SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS. 
SINCE TEMPS SHOULD QUICKLY FALL BELOW FREEZING AFTER SUNSET THIS 
EVENING...THINK THIS SNOWFALL COULD CREATE SLIPPERY ROAD CONDITIONS 
(ESPECIALLY UNTREATED ROADS). WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE 
A WINTER WX ADVISORY AREAWIDE FOR THIS EVENING...MENTIONING 1 TO 3 
INCHES OF SNOW POSSIBLE. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH THURSDAY...BUT WILL COMPROMISE 
WHERE DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR THE EXTENDED. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGING INTO THE AREA THROUGH SUNDAY. WEAK MEAN TROUGH IN 
THE GREAT LAKES REGION. SHORT WAVE DIGS SE ON SAT BRINGING SOME 
CLOUDS TO NE AREAS BUT PCPN EXPECTED TO STAY N OF AREA. UPPER TROUGH 
DEEPENS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON MONDAY. WEAK COLD FRONT 
MOVES THROUGH LATE MONDAY WITH LOW CHANCE FOR PCPN WITH SECONDARY 
SURFACE TROUGH ON TUE ACROSS SW VA/NE TN. COOL MORNINGS WITH DECENT 
WARM UP SUN AND MONDAY IN ADVANCE OF COLD FRONT.

230 PM EST TUE FEB 8 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...GENERALLY TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS EXPECTED THROUGH MOST THE SHORT TERM AS SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO THE REGION OVERNIGHT. A SOUTHERN 
STREAM SYSTEM IS PROJECTED TO APPROACH LATE IN THE SHORT TERM...BUT 
NO SIGNIFICANT IMPACT IS EXPECTED DURING THIS TIME FRAME. 
NEVERTHELESS...HAVE BUMPED UP POPS TO CHANCE OVER VIRTUALLY ALL OF 
OUR CWA BY LATE IN THE PERIOD. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED COOLER 
MAV GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE GFS AND NAM HAVE CONVERGED IN THEIR GENERAL DEPICTIONS OF THE 
SYSTEM AFFECTING THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE DEPTH INCREASES 
QUICKLY AFTER 00Z THU AS THE 850 MB CIRCULATION MOVES INTO THE LOWER 
MS REGION. LARGE-SCALE QG FORCING IS GREATEST BETWEEN 00-06Z...WITH 
THE NAM SHOWING A FRONTOGENESIS ZONE PASSING OVER THE AREA IN THIS 
WINDOW. ALTHOUGH TIMING IS SIMILAR BETWEEN MODELS...NAM QPF AMOUNTS 
REMAIN MUCH HIGHER THAN THE GFS AND THE SREF AND HPC. THE NAM SNOWS 
ACCUMULATIONS OF 2-4 INCHES WHICH SEEM TOO HIGH GIVEN THAT LIFT IS 
NOT VERY STRONG AND THE FAST MOVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM...AND WILL GO 
WITH THE HPC GUIDANCE OF 1-2 INCHES ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. THE
MODEL TREND HAS BEEN TOWARD A FASTER SYSTEM...AND WILL DROP BACK
POPS ON THU MORNING TO A SLIGHT/LOW CHANCE. WILL ISSUE AN SPS TO
HIGHLIGHT THIS EVENT AS SOME LOCATIONS COULD APPROACH ADVISORY
CRITERIA.

THE REST OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD LOOKS DRY. AN BROAD UPPER TROUGH 
OVER THE EASTERN CONUS WILL KEEP TEMPS BELOW NORMAL ON FRIDAY...THEN 
THE TROUGH MOVES OFF THE COAST ON SATURDAY...BRINGING WARMER TEMPS 
IN THE 50S FOR SUNDAY. THE GFS SHOWS ANOTHER DEEP TROUGH DROPPING 
ACROSS THE EAST COAST ON MONDAY...BUT THE ECMWF SHOWS A MUCH WEAKER 
SHORTWAVE WITH A STRONG RIDGE BEHIND IT. WILL AWAIT LATER MODEL RUNS 
BEFORE ANY DRASTIC CHANGES ARE MADE...AND WILL STICK TO TEMPS WITHIN 
A FEW DEGREES OF NORMAL FOR NOW.

GROUND. THE GFS IS QUICKER TO BRING IN PRECIP THAN THE NAM...WHICH 
HOLDS OFF PRECIP UNTIL AFTER 00Z THU. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE SLOWER 
NAM BUT KEEP A SLIGHT/LOW CHANCE POP IN NORTH AND WEST ON WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. STRONGER LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH FRONTOGENESIS AND THE UPPER 
JET WILL MOVE IN AFTER 00Z THU. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS WED NIGHT WITH 
LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS...GENERALLY 1 TO 2 INCHES. IF THE TRACK OF 
THE LOW IS FARTHER NORTH...AMOUNTS COULD BE HIGHER. PRECIP WILL END 
THURSDAY MORNING WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE 700 MB TROUGH AXIS. 

THE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM WILL BE DRY WITH A GENERAL WARMING 
TREND. A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL BE OVER THE AREA FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY..WHICH SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL. A WEAK UPPER

.DISCUSSION...NO CHANGES PLANNED AS FORECAST FOR TODAY APPEARS
GENERALLY ON TRACK. MAIN ISSUES THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD ARE TIMING
OF PRECIP ONSET AND TEMPS. RADAR MOSAIC SHOWS MAIN AREA OF PRECIP
CURRENTLY IN WEST TENNESSEE AND WESTERN AND CENTRAL KENTUCKY. A
FEW LIGHT RETURNS IN ADVANCE OF THIS MAIN PRECIP AREA DO NOT SHOW
ANY INDICATION OF REACHING SURFACE BASED ON SURFACE OBS. PRECIP
CHANCES SHOULD INCREASE BY LATE AFTERNOON FROM WEST TO EAST AS MAIN
PRECIP AXIS APPROACHES AREA. TEMPS AN ISSUE AS SURFACE LAYER
REMAINS DRY AND SOME EVAPORATIVE COOLING EXPECTED AS PRECIP MOVES
EAST. NEVERTHELESS...WARM ADVECTION EXPECTED TO INCREASE AS UPPER
TROUGH APPROACHES THIS AFTERNOON. THUS MAX TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE
BASED ON THIS ANTICIPATED SCENARIO...CURRENT TRENDS AND LATEST
MAV/LAV GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...UPPER TROUGH MOVING EAST INTO THE MID MS RVR VLY EARLY 
TODAY. DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE NE THROUGH TN RVR VLY THIS 
MORNING. SW TO NE UPPER JET AXIS IN PLACE OVER THE MRX CWA. CLOUDS 
WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AND THICKEN FROM THE TOP DOWN TODAY. WARM 
AIR ADVECTION WILL MOVE UP THE EAST TN VLY IN ADVANCE OF THE LOW. 
LIGHT RAIN WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST THIS AFTERNOON. THE 
SURFACE LOW WILL TRACK ACROSS SW VA THIS EVENING. THE UPPER TROUGH 
WILL MOVE QUICKLY EAST THROUGH THE AREA THIS EVENING. A COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE AREA AROUND 08/03Z. BEST CHANCE FOR PCPN 
WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT. FREEZING LEVEL FALLS FAST AND EXPECT A FAST 
CHANGE OVER TO SNOW. PERIOD OF GOOD SNOWFALL WILL BE BRIEF AND 
ACCUMULATION WILL BE HINDERED BY MELTING AT SNOW ONSET. MOISTURE 
DROPS OFF AFTER COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH LOW RH IN THE SNOW GROWTH 
REGION. LIGHT SNOW ACCOMULATION ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AREAS AS 
SNOW TAPERS OFF OVERNIGHT. TEMPS NEAR NORMAL AND CLOSE TO GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS MAY 
LINGER OVER FAR NORTHERN AREAS EARLY TUESDAY MORNING...OTHERWISE... 
SHOULD SEE IMPROVING CONDITIONS WITH CLEARING SKIES AND COOL 
TEMPERATURES TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY.  MAIN SYSTEM ON CONCERN THIS 
EXTENDED PACKAGE CONTINUES TO BE A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM EXPECTED TO 
MOVE THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  MODELS/RUNS STILL INDICATE 
DIFFERENCES IN DETAILS WITH THIS SYSTEM...ESPECIALLY IN REGARDS TO 
WHERE THE MAIN BAND OF PRECIP MOVES THROUGH.  WILL LIMIT LOW POPS TO 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND KEEP LIKELY POPS FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH 
DECREASING POPS FOR THURSDAY.  TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH 
FOR A MOSTLY SNOW EVENT...THOUGH A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW IS POSSIBLE 
SOUTH.  MAIN QUESTION WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE WHERE THE MAIN BAND 
OF PRECIP TRACKS THROUGH.  STILL BELIEVE THIS BAND WILL STAY TO OUR 
SOUTH SO DO NOT EXPECT THIS WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT SNOW EVENT BUT 
WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR.  BEHIND THIS SYSTEM...UNSEASONABLY COOL 
AND DRY AIR MOVES IN FOR FRIDAY.  CONTINUED DRY WITH MODERATING 
TEMPERATURES EXPECTED FOR THE WEEKEND.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY AND OZARKS REGION...GENERALLY FROM CHICAGO EXTENDING 
SOUTHWEST TO NEAR LITTLE ROCK. THIS COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY OVERNIGHT...WITH CLOUDS CONTINUING TO 
INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME LIGHT 
ECHOES OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT THINK THIS IS MAINLY MID LEVEL 
MOISTURE THAT IS NOT REACHING THE GROUND.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT IN 
BRINGING A COLD FRONT THROUGH OUR AREA ON MONDAY...BUT DIFFER IN THE 
DETAILS. GFS MUCH QUICKER IN BRINGING MOISTURE/PRECIP ACROSS THE 
AREA...WITH NAM...SUPPORTED BY THE SREF...SLOWER WITH NORTHEAST 
SECTIONS MAINLY DRY THROUGH MONDAY.  THINK THE GFS IS BEING TOO 
AGGRESSIVE IN THIS CASE...SO WILL USE MORE OF A BLENDED SOLUTION.  
WILL BE DRY TONIGHT WITH CLOUDS INCREASING...THEN WILL BRING PRECIP 
IN MAINLY MONDAY AFTERNOON.  SHOULD BE WARM AT LOWER LEVELS...SO 
MAINLY RAIN...BUT FREEZING LEVELS MAY LOWER ENOUGH FOR SOME SNOW 
OVER THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS MONDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING.  NO MAJOR 
ARGUMENTS WITH MAV TEMPS.   

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...COUPLE OF SYSTEMS STILL 
ON TRACK TO AFFECT THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH THE LONG 
TERM. MONDAY'S SYSTEM WINDS DOWN MONDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT PASSES 
THROUGH AREA CHANGING PRECIP TO ALL SNOW DURING THAT PERIOD. THIS 
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A SIGNIFICANT SNOW EVENT AT THIS TIME...WITH 
MINOR ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE MAINLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. DETAILS 
OF SECOND SYSTEM STILL SOMEWHAT MURKY...BUT GENERAL MODEL CONSENSUS 
SHOWS MAIN EVENT WILL OCCUR WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LATEST MODEL/ENSEMBLE 
RUNS SUGGEST MAIN PRECIP AXIS WILL REMAIN SOUTH AND QPFS GENERALLY 
PROJECTED TO BE QUITE LIGHT FOR OUR AREA. THUS NOT ANTICIPATING A 
MAJOR WINTER EVENT AT THIS TIME...ALTHOUGH MOST PRECIP WILL PROBABLY 
OCCUR AS SNOW. DID BUMP UP POPS SOMEWHAT TO LIKELY AREA-WIDE.

BALANCE OF FORECAST APPEARS DRY WITH TEMPS SLOWLY MODERATING FROM 
WELL BELOW CLIMO TO NEAR CLIMO BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM. FOR 
TEMPS...TENDED TO FAVOR COOLER OF THE GUIDANCE VALUES.

.SHORT TERM...SMALL SYSTEM THAT WAS OVER W AND MID TN THIS MORNING 
HAS LIFTED NEWD INTO KY THIS AFTERNOON.  THE LIFT WITH THIS SYSTEM IS 
MAINLY MISSING OUR CWA...LOOKS LIKE SOME PRECIP SCRAPING ACROSS OUR 
NORTHERN-MOST COUNTIES.  STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS ARE FILLING IN BEHIND 
COLD FRONT.  CLOUDS PARTIALLY SUSTAINED BY SURFACE HEATING...BUT 
STILL WILL BE SLOW TO MAKE THEIR WAY THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT.  
TRAJECTORY FORECASTS FOR 0-1 KM SHOW SOURCE REGION FOR SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AIR MASS IS FROM ARKLATEX REGION...CLEARING LINE JUST WEST 
OF MISS RIVER NOW...JUST ADVECTION OF THIS WOULD HAVE BACK EDGE OF 
CLOUDS NEAR KTYS BY 12Z...BUT WITH EROSION FROM ABOVE...WOULD THINK 
THAT BACK EDGE WILL BE ACCELERATING.  SUNDAY MORNING SHOULD SEE 
PLENTY OF SUN...BUT HIGH CLOUDS FROM THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL BE 
ENCROACHING FROM THE WEST DURING THE AFTERNOON.  GFS MOS GUIDANCE 
TEMPS FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY LOOK PRETTY GOOD...WILL STICK CLOSE TO 
THEM.  GUSTY WINDS THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD SUBSIDE QUICKLY AS DOWNWARD 
TRANSPORT LESSENS WITH DECOUPLING OF BOUNDARY LAYER...AND PRESSURE 
GRADIENT RELAXES. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WHILE MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO THE WEAK 
SYSTEM ON MONDAY...THE SYSTEM EXPECTED BY MID WEEK REMAINS LOW 
CONFIDENCE. A GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY STILL SURROUNDS THE TRACK... 
TIMING...INTENSITY...PRECIP TYPE AND EVEN QPF. LATEST MODEL RUNS 
SEEM TO HAVE SETTLED A BIT BETTER ON TIMING...MAINLY IN THE LATE 
WEDNESDAY TO EARLY THURSDAY TIME FRAME. BASED ON THE EXPECTED 
TIMING...ANTICIPATE THAT MOST OF THE PRECIP WILL OCCUR AS SNOW 
GENERALLY. THE MAIN UNCERTAINTY NOW APPEARS TO BE QPF AS MODELS HAVE 
BEEN BACKING OFF ON THIS PARAMETER IN LATEST RUNS. ONLY A FEW OF THE 
21 GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE NOW PROJECTING EVEN 0.15 INCH QPF FOR 
THAT TIME FRAME...WITH THE MORE SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS REMAINING SOUTH 
AND EAST. AT THIS TIME...ANY ATTEMPT AT TRYING TO QUANTIFY 
SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS SYSTEM WOULD BE WILD SPECULATION. WILL CONTINUE 
TO HIGHLIGHT IN HWO PRODUCT...BUT REMAIN INTENTIONALLY VAGUE 
REGARDING ITS POTENTIAL IMPACT.

THE MONDAY SYSTEM APPEARS WILL BE MAINLY A RAIN EVENT...AND A MINOR 
ONE AT THAT. THE PRECIP MAY BEGIN AND END AS SNOW OR MIXED PRECIP 
TYPE...BUT TEMPS WILL BE TOO WARM FOR ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT DURING 
THE DAY ON MONDAY. THE BALANCE OF THE LONG TERM APPEARS GENERALLY 
DRY ALBEIT WITH BELOW CLIMO TEMPS AT THIS POINT. TEMPS EXPECTED TO 
SLOWLY MODERATE TO NEAR CLIMO BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM AS UPPER FLOW 
DEAMPLIFIES TO A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW.

.DISCUSSION...FIRST SYSTEM WITH SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY HAS EXITED 
THE NORTHEASTERN CORNER OF AREA...EVEN HAD A COUPLE OF CG LIGHTNING 
STRIKES NEAR 12Z.  NEXT SYSTEM NOW IN MIDDLE TN IS LIFTING TO THE 
NORTHEAST STEADILY.  DEEPER MOISTURE WITH IT HAS SOME PATCHY POCKETS 
OF LIGHT RAIN OR SNOW.  CHARACTER OF PRECIP ON RADAR LOOKED 
SHOWERY...SO BRIEFLY HAD CONCERNS ABOUT MORE ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
MOVING INTO AREA...BUT AIRMASS WITH THIS SYSTEM IS VERY STABLE WHERE 
PRECIP IS LOCATED...SO APPARENTLY JUST SOME WEAK DYNAMIC LIFT GOING 
ON.  NOT OVERLY IMPORTANT FOR OUR AREA ANYWAY...AS THIS AREA IS 
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO THE NE...WITH ITS DEEPER MOISTURE MISSING 
OUR AREA.  WILL KEEP SOME POPS IN VA COUNTIES AND NE TN MOUNTAINS 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON...BUT DRY ELSEWHERE.  IN THIS AREA...LOOKS LIKE 
MOSTLY RAIN FOR PRECIP TYPE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SNOW POSSIBLE AT 
HIGHER LOCATIONS.  WITH COLDER AIR MOVING IN WHAT RAIN THERE IS 
COULD TRY TO SWITCH TO SNOW...BUT ONCE AGAIN...JUST TALKING 20-30 
PERCENT POPS...AND JUST EXTREME NORTHERN AREAS.

TEMPERATURES HAVE SHOT UP THIS MORNING WITH STRONG MIXING...COLD 
FRONT ENTERING AREA...TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY HOLD FAIRLY STEADY AS 
COLDER AIR AND FILTERED SUN BALANCE OUT SOMEWHAT.  GUSTY WINDS THIS 
MORNING AT LOCATIONS THAT HAVE BEEN ABLE TO MIX OUT.  WINDS IN 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS BRIEFLY MET ADVISORY CRITERIA...BUT SEVERAL

THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS PASSING THROUGH LATE MONDAY-EARLY TUESDAY. 
THIS SYSTEM DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE SIGNIFICANT AT THIS TIME... 
ALTHOUGH SOME WINTERY PRECIP MAY PRECEDE IT EARLY MONDAY. NEXT 
SYSTEM IS MORE PROBLEMATIC AS MODELS CONTINUE TO DISAGREE ON THE 
TRACK...INTENSITY AND TIMING OF THE SYSTEM. GFS HAS DEPICTED THE 
GREATEST IMPACT FROM THIS FEATURE WITH POTENTIAL OF SIGNIFICANT 
SNOW. HOWEVER...ECMWF AND CANADIAN MODELS DEPICT A MORE AMPLIFIED 
TROUGH AND THUS A WARMER SCENARIO WHICH IMPLIES MORE OF A RAIN 
EVENT. GEFS ENSEMBLE SPREAD TOO GREAT TO PROVIDE MUCH HELP. THUS 
STILL TOO EARLY TO INFER POTENTIAL IMPACTS AT THIS TIME. DID BUMP UP

225 PM EST THU FEB 3 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
DEVELOPING IN THE GULF WILL TRACK NORTHEAST DURING THE PERIOD.  THIS 
WILL PUSH MOISTURE INTO OUR REGION OVERNIGHT AND ESPECIALLY FRIDAY.  
WHILE THIS DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A BIG PRECIP PRODUCER...PRECIP TYPE IS 
VERY PROBLEMATIC AS PRECIP MOVES IN TONIGHT/EARLY FRIDAY.  MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE IT WILL BE TOO WARM ALOFT FOR ANY SNOW...BUT HAVE 
NOTED THAT SOME VERY LIGHT SNOW HAS BRIEFLY OCCURRED FURTHER SOUTHWEST 
ON THE LEADING EDGE...AS EVAPORATIVE COOLING TEMPORARILY COOLS THE 
COLUMN. OTHER THAN SOME LIGHT SNOW OR SLEET EARLY...PRECIP SHOULD BE 
FALLING AS ALL LIQUID...BUT WITH SURFACE TEMPS POSSIBLY BELOW 
FREEZING LATE TONIGHT/EARLY FRIDAY...SOME AREAS MAY SEE SOME LIGHT 
FREEZING RAIN AS WELL.  LOOKS LIKE PRECIP WILL CHANGE TO ALL RAIN BY 
AFTERNOON AS TEMPS CONTINUE TO SLOWLY RISE.  WHILE IT DOES NOT LOOK 
LIKE ANY WINTRY PRECIP WILL ACCUMULATE MUCH...ANY FREEZING RAIN IS 
OF COURSE A SIGNIFICANT CONCERN.  GIVEN UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW 
WIDESPREAD ANY PROBLEMS MAY BE...WILL NOT ISSUE ANY WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORY AT THIS TIME AND WILL JUST CONTINUE SPS.  HOWEVER...THIS 
SITUATION WILL OBVIOUSLY HAVE TO BE MONITORED CLOSELY...AS THE 
POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR MORE SIGNIFICANT PROBLEMS.     

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...CONFIDENCE VERY LOW FOR 
LATTER PORTION OF LONG TERM AS MODELS AND ENSEMBLES CONTINUE TO 
SUFFER FROM POOR RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY IN ADDITION TO GENERAL 
DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS. ENSEMBLES EXHIBIT 
UNUSUALLY WIDE SPREAD AMONG MEMBERS. THERE IS GENERAL AGREEMENT ON 
LONG WAVE TROUGH BECOMING ESTABLISHED OVER THE EASTERN TWO-THIRDS OF 
THE CONUS. THE PROGRESSIVE NATURE OF INDIVIDUAL SHORT WAVES 
PROGRESSING THROUGH THIS LONG WAVE FLOW PRECLUDES ANY CERTAINTY WITH 
RESPECT TO TIMING HOWEVER. THUS HAVE MADE VERY FEW CHANGES TO 
PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST.

MODELS ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT TOMORROW'S SYSTEM WILL 
PULL OUT OF THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. STILL ANTICIPATING MAINLY RAIN AS 
MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS DEPICT ABOVE FREEZING TEMPS TO NEAR 700 MB. 
TRAILING UPPER TROUGH PASSES JUST NORTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA ON 
SATURDAY. MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY BEFORE MODEL DISCREPANCIES ARISE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ANOTHER DRY DAY EXPECTED TODAY 
WITH SOME SUNSHINE...ALTHOUGH CIRRUS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPAND ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA AS MOISTURE STREAMS NORTHEAST AHEAD OF 
SOUTHWESTERN U.S. UPPER TROF. THE TROF/CLOSED LOW WILL MOVE SLOWLY 
EAST TODAY EVENTUALLY BUILDING INTO CENTRAL TEXAS BY 12Z FRIDAY. 
MOISTURE WILL GRADUALLY DEEPEN AHEAD OF THE TROF OVERRIDING COOLER 
SUB FREEZING AIR ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE THAT PRECIP THAT DEVELOPS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH TONIGHT 
SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF SNOW. AS TEMPERATURES SLOWLY RISE WITH 
INCREASING WARM AIR ADVECTION...RAIN WILL BECOME MIXED WITH THE SNOW 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THE PRECIP 
SHOULD FALL MAINLY AS SNOW ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA 
HOWEVER...LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED ACROSS MOST OF THE 
AREA AS QPF SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT IN THIS REGION PRIOR TO 12Z FRI. 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA MAY SEE A DUSTING 
TO AS MUCH AS ONE INCH WITH THE HIGHER ONE INCH TOTALS MORE LIKELY 
OCCURRING IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN.   

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE MODELS HAVE TRENDED 
FASTER FOR THE FRIDAY-SATURDAY SYSTEM. CATEGORICAL POPS WILL SPREAD 
ACROSS THE AREA FROM SOUTH TO NORTH FRIDAY MORNING...MAINLY AS SNOW 
BUT CHANGING TO RAIN THROUGH THE MORNING AS DEEP WARM ADVECTION 
ENSUES. SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE FRIDAY 
MORNING...AN INCH OR LESS EVEN IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE STRONGEST 
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER JET DYNAMICS OCCURS FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON...BY THEN PRECIP IS ALL RAIN. LIFT AND MOISTURE DEPTH 
DECREASE AFTER MIDNIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT AS WE ARE IN THE DRY SLOT 
DIRECTLY UNDER THE UPPER JET. POPS DROP BACK TO A CHANCE SATURDAY 
MORNING WITH THE LACK OF MOISTURE IN THE ICE NUCLEATION ZONE...AND 
WE COULD SEE JUST DRIZZLE MUCH OF THE DAY. MOVEMENT OF THE UPPER JET 
TO OUR EAST WILL END PRECIP BY 00Z SUNDAY. 

SUNDAY LOOKS TO BE DRY WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES BEFORE THE NEXT 
SYSTEM APPROACHES FOR MONDAY. GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH A DEEP TROUGH BEING POSITIONED OVER THE EASTERN CONUS 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY. PRECIP AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...FOLLOWED BY A STRONG PUNCH OF COLD AIR FOR 
TUESDAY. EXPECT HIGHS ONLY IN THE 30S TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...WITH 
LOWS IN THE TEENS.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
A SOUTHERN CLOSED LOW OVER WESTERN MEXICO MOVES EAST FRIDAY AND
THEN IS PICKED UP BY SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS AND MERGES WITH IT
SATURDAY. MOISTURE WILL LIFT NORTHWARD AND SPREAD PRECIPITATION
INTO SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY MORNING. MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL SHOW
A DEEP NEAR-FREEZING ISOTHERMAL LAYER AT THE ONSET OF PRECIP...SO
THERE MAY BE SOME MIXED PRECIPITATION WITH LIGHT SLEET...FREEZING
RAIN AND SNOW BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN AS WARM ADVECTION INCREASES
FRIDAY. QPF AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT THURSDAY NIGHT AND
FRIDAY MORNING AND TEMPERATURES MOSTLY CLOSE TO FREEZING SO DO NOT
EXPECT ANY SIGNIFICANT TRAVEL PROBLEMS. THE UPPER TROUGH MOVES
EAST SLOWLY SO HIGH PRECIPITATION CHANCES CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY
NIGHT. TEMPERATURES FRIDAY NIGHT WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER TO MID
30S...WITH THE RAIN CONTINUING BUT MAY CHANGE TO SNOW LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT OR EARLY SATURDAY AS THE UPPER TROUGH MOVES THROUGH. NAM
MODEL KEEPS WARM AIR OVER REGION THROUGH MOST OF THE NIGHT LOWERING
FREEZING LEVELS SATURDAY MORNING WITH GFS A LITTLE QUICKER WITH
COLDER AIR MOVING IN. NO ACCUMULATION FRIDAY NIGHT EXPECTED EXCEPT
MAYBE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. SATURDAY POSSIBLE LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS
NORTHEAST AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS. LATE SATURDAY THIS SYSTEM MOVES
OUT AND HIGHER PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND.
SUNDAY A NEW SYSTEM DEVELOPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND DIGS
UPPER TROUGH SOUTH INTO TEXAS. A NEW COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE
REGION MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WITH
HIGHS IN THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S. HOWEVER TUESDAY THE SYSTEM WILL

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DEEP LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CONTINUES 
TO SHIFT STEADILY NORTHEAST ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY. THE 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT IS NEARING THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. PLACED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR RAIN ACROSS THE EXTREME NORTHEAST 
CORNER OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR POSSIBLE SPRINKLES NEAR THE 
DEPARTING FRONT EARLY THIS MORNING. MASS OF LOW CLOUDS FOLLOWS IN 
BEHIND THE FRONT BUT WESTERLY FLOW MAY LEAD TO SOME BREAKS IN THE 
GREAT VALLEY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE MODELS 
ALLOW FOR DRY ADVECTION THROUGH THE DAY. KEPT THE WIND PRODUCTS 
GOING AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT STILL RATHER STRONG BUT SHOULD RELAX 
BY MID DAY. MAX TEMP FORECAST WILL BE A LITTLE CHALLENGING WITH 
TREMENDOUS TEMPERATURE GRADIENT APPROACHING THROUGH MIDDLE 
TENNESSEE. TRIED TO TIME THE CHILLY ARRIVAL WITH THE KNOWLEDGE OF 
THE IMPEDING IMPACTS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THE ARCTIC AIRMASS 
MAY NOT ALLOW FOR MUCH MOVEMENT IN TEMPERATURE TODAY ONCE THE FRIGID 
STUFF SPILLS ACROSS THE PLATEAU. A MUCH COLDER NIGHT IS IN STORE 
TONIGHT WITH MIN TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.   

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A SOUTHERN STREAM CLOSED LOW 
OVER THE DESERT SW GETS PICKED UP BY THE NORTHERN STREAM OVER THE 
PLAINS ON FRIDAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT AND UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE JET 
ENTRANCE REGION WILL SPREAD PRECIP INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE 
AREA BEGINNING FRIDAY MORNING. MODELS SOUNDINGS SHOW A DEEP 
NEAR-FREEZING ISOTHERMAL LAYER AT THE ONSET OF PRECIP...SO IT MAY 
BEGIN AS SNOW BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN AS WARM ADVECTION INCREASES 
THROUGH THE DAY. EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE UPPER TROUGH IS 
SLOW...SO CATEGORICAL TO LIKELY POPS WILL REMAIN IN THE AREA THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT. LIFT IS NOT STRONG WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND SURFACE 
CYCLOGENESIS IS ILL-DEFINED...SO QPF SHOULD BE RELATIVELY MODEST. 
ALTHOUGH SURFACE TEMPS FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE IN THE MID 30S...A DEEP 
ABOVE-FREEZING LAYER SHOULD KEEP THE PRECIP ALL RAIN UNTIL IT ENDS 
ON SATURDAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS.

A BROAD UPPER TROUGH REMAINS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS THROUGH MONDAY. 
WHILE WEAK SHORTWAVES WITHIN THE BROAD TROUGH MAY AFFECT THE 
AREA...CONFIDENCE IN MODEL DETAILS IS TOO LOW TO MENTION ANY PRECIP 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WILL KEEP THESE DAYS DRY WITH TEMPS SLIGHTLY 
BELOW NORMAL. A MORE AMPLIFIED TROUGH IS SHOWN BY THE GFS AND ECMWF 
TO AFFECT THE AREA ON TUESDAY. WILL INCLUDE CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS WITH THIS SYSTEM MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. A SUBSTANTIALLY 
COLDER AIR MASS APPEARS TO FOLLOW THIS TROUGH FOR THE MIDDLE OF NEXT 
WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
POISED TO MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT.  
AHEAD OF THE ASSOCIATE COLD FRONT...A LARGE AREA OF RAIN 
SHOWERS...POSSIBLY WITH SOME EMBEDDED THUNDER...WILL PUSH ACROSS THE 
MRX CWA FOR CATEGORICAL POPS.  TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN WARM ENOUGH 
FOR AN ALL RAIN EVENT.  OF GREATER CONCERN WILL BE STRONG WINDS 
ACCOMPANYING THE FRONT.  WINDS WILL INCREASE OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY 
OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  WIND GUSTS AT HIGHER POINTS IN THE TN VALLEY 
COULD SEE 40 MPH.  THE MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS SHOULD SEE 
SUSTAINED WINDS OF 20 TO 30 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 50 TO 60 MPH.  A WIND 
ADVISORY AND A HIGH WIND WARNING WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT OVERNIGHT.  
CONDITIONS IMPROVE ON WEDNESDAY...WINDS WILL SLOWLY DIMINISH BUT 
REMAIN GUSTY THROUGH THE DAY.  DRIER...COOLER AIR MOVES IN FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB MORE THAN A FEW 
DEGREES DURING THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN FAIR 
AGREEMENT AND CONTINUITY FOR THIS PACKAGE...WITH TWO MAIN SYSTEMS 
EXPECTED. A SRN STREAM SYSTEM WILL SPREAD PRECIPITATION (MOSTLY RAIN 
INITIALLY) NORTHWARD ON FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH VERY FEW 
DIFFERENCES AMONGST THE NAM/GFS/ECMWF MODELS. POPS WERE INCREASED 
FOR THIS SYSTEM TO BE IN LINE WITH NEIGHBORS TO OUR WEST...SOUTH AND 
EAST. KEPT POPS AROUND SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SW VA FOR NOW. 

MOISTURE DIMINISHES AS COLD AIR ADVECTS IN ON SATURDAY...AND OUR
PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKED GOOD WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WEST AND CHANCE 
POPS EAST. I CHOSE TO STAY A BIT BELOW GFSX MOS FOR MAX TEMPS 
SATURDAY. DON'T EXPECT MUCH SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL WITH THIS SYSTEM.

OTHER SYSTEM WILL BE THE UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT EARLY NEXT WEEK 
WHICH MODELS CONTINUE TO SLOW DOWN. THIS SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO 
BE MORE SIGNIFICANT AND TAP INTO GULF MOISTURE...WITH BETTER LIFT 
AND STRONGER COLD AIR ADVECTION. TIMING FOR THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO BE 
MOSTLY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. TRENDED CLOSER TO NWS NEIGHBORS 
TEMP GRIDS AND NOT AS COLD AS THE GFSX MOS...AS ECMWF WOULD BRING 
COLDER AIR IN NOT QUITE AS SOON AS DAY 7.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE TRACKING FROM TX TO THE OHIO 
VALLEY REGION TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE PRIMARY CONCERN FOR OUR AREA 
WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE HIGH WINDS. AS THE LOW MOVES INTO WEST TN
LATE THIS AFTERNOON...AN IDEAL SETUP FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES WILL
DEVELOP AND CONTINUE THROUGH TONIGHT. WIND GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 70
MPH CAN BE EXPECTED IN THE MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS. A HIGH
WIND WARNING WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE COUNTIES CURRENTLY IN A WATCH.
ALL OTHER COUNTIES WILL BE IN A WIND ADVISORY. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO
A MORE SW DIRECTION LATE TONIGHT...ENDING THE MOUNTAIN WAVE
POTENTIAL...BUT A STRONG SYNOPTIC PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL KEEP AT
LEAST ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS IN THE AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING.
WILL EXTEND THE END TIME OF THE WARNING AND ADVISORY TO 18Z
WEDNESDAY.

SOME LIGHT SCATTERED RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE MORNING. STRONG THETA-E ADVECTION WILL SPREAD 
ADDITIONAL RAIN INTO THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. 
THE PERIOD OF GREATEST QG FORCING OVER OUR AREA WILL BE BETWEEN 00Z 
AND 09Z TONIGHT...AND MODELS INDICATE SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY WILL 
BE PRESENT. CAPE VALUES ABOVE 800 MB WILL BE IN THE 100-200 RANGE 
TONIGHT...AND LOW LEVEL THETA-E RISES TO 320 K IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS. 
WILL HAVE A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS SOUTH TO A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH.

A SHARP FROPA WILL OCCUR BETWEEN 09Z AND 15Z WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...QUICKLY ENDING PRECIP CHANCES. STRONG COLD ADVECTION ON 
THE HEELS OF THE FRONT WILL MEAN FALLING TEMPS THROUGH THE DAY. A 
NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT THURSDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT WILL KEEP 
THE AREA DRY WITH TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
ADJUSTED POPS A LITTLE HIGHER FOR FRIDAY AS MODELS IN A LITTLE
BETTER AGREEMENT CONCERNING SHORTWAVE TROF SHIFTING EAST ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS DURING THE DAY AND ON ITS WAY THROUGH THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY 12Z SATURDAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MOISTURE
WILL BE ON THE INCREASE WHILE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST
FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO INTO THE CAROLINAS. HAD TO APPLY SOME LIGHT
SNOW FRIDAY MORNING WITH PRECIP COMING IN OVER THE TOP OF INITIALLY
SUBFREEZING AIR. WENT WITH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AS
MORE SHORTWAVE ENERGY DROPS INTO THE BASE OF GRADUALLY EASTWARD
MIGRATING LONG WAVE TROF. COLDER AIR WILL BE SPILLING IN BEHIND THE
DEPARTING TROF AND RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW ACROSS MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. A FINAL SHORTWAVE BUILDS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON SATURDAY SO HAD TO KEEP A SLIGHT
THROUGH LOW CHANCE POP FOR RAIN/SNOW AND HELD ONTO SOME OROGRAPHIC
SNOW FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH
CAROLINA BORDER THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN THE
APPROXIMATE 30 HOUR PERIOD FREE FROM PRECIPITATION SUNDAY INTO MID
DAY MONDAY BEFORE THE NEXT SYSTEM DRIVES EAST TOWARD THE REGION.
USED SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA FOR MONDAY BUT THE BULK OF THE SYSTEM MAY HOLD OFF UNTIL
MONDAY NIGHT SO APPLIED THE LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION
FOR THIS FINAL 12 HOUR PERIOD OF THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...A FEW ISOLATED LIGHT 
RAIN SHOWERS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION OVERNIGHT AS A WEAK AREA 
OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKS THROUGH THE CAROLINAS.  THE MAIN WEATHER 
MAKER OF THE SHORT TERM WILL BE A STRONG COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT.  STRONG SOUTH WINDS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE AREA AS THE 
FRONT APPROACHES.  THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL SEE WINDS OF 25 TO 40 
MPH WITH GUSTS OF 50 TO 60 MPH.  A HIGH WIND WATCH HAS BEEN ISSUED 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT FOR THESE AREAS.  LOWER ELEVATIONS SHOULD HAVE 
WINDS OF 15 TO 25 MPH WITH STRONGER GUSTS.  A LARGE BAND OF RAIN 
WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT FOR CATEGORICAL POPS.  THE 
STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BRING IN WARM AIR...WHICH 
WILL KEEP TUESDAY NIGHT PRECIP AS RAIN AT ALL BUT THE HIGHEST 
ELEVATIONS.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...LINGERING RAIN OR SNOW 
CHANCES FOR WEDNESDAY BEHIND EXITING FRONT AND WINDS MAY STAY NEAR 
ADVISORY CRITERIA BEFORE NOON. ADJUSTED TEMP GRIDS TO REFLECT STEADY 
OR FALLING TEMPS IN THE AFTERNOON. 

UPPER TROUGH TO OUR WEST MAY LEAD TO ANOTHER CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION 
BY FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT...PER LATEST SHORT AND MEDIUM RANGE 
MODELS. TRIED TO LIMIT TO SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR NOW...AND 
KEEP AS MANY PERIODS DRY AS POSSIBLE (THURSDAY-THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT-SUNDAY NIGHT). FOR NEW DAY 7 (MONDAY)...MODELS AND 
GFSX MOS TRENDING WETTER...AHEAD OF ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT.
GEM AND ECMWF SHOW SURFACE LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE FRONT...MOVING NE 
FROM THE WRN GULF/LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION (AS HAS OCCURRED 
LATELY). STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY THAT FAR OUT WITH MINOR DIFFERENCES 
WITH GFS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH PASSING TO OUR SOUTH IS BRINGING LIGHT RAIN 
SHOWERS TO NORTHERN AL AND GA. THESE SHOWERS WILL LIKELY AFFECT 
EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THIS MORNING. AS THE TROUGH 
MOVES EAST RAIN CHANCES WILL DECREASE...BUT MODELS INDICATE NEAR 
SATURATION UP TO 700 MB PERSISTING THROUGH THE DAY DUE TO A 
SOUTHERLY FLOW OF MOISTURE. THUS WILL HAVE CLOUDY SKIES AND CHANCE 
TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS CONTINUING THROUGH THE DAY. THE LACK OF LIFT 
WILL MEAN QPF WILL BE VERY LIGHT...LESS THAN A TENTH OF AN INCH. 
CONFIDENCE IN THE MAX TEMP FORECAST IS LOW AS THERE IS A LARGE 
SPREAD IN MOS GUIDANCE...BUT EXPECT THAT OVERCAST CLOUDS WILL 
PREVENT MORE THAN A 10 DEGREE RISE IN TEMPS FROM CURRENT OBS...SO 
LEANED TOWARD THE COOLER SIDE. MOISTURE DEPTH DECREASES SLIGHTLY 
TONIGHT WITH SLIGHT RIDGING ALOFT...SO PRECIP CHANCES LOWER TO JUST 
A SLIGHT CHANCE. THE HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS SHOWN BY THE 00Z GFS 
MOS FOR TONIGHT LOOK WAY TOO HIGH GIVEN THE LACK OF LIFT. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FRONT ENTERS THE AREA ON
TUESDAY AND LINGERS INTO WEDNESDAY. WILL CONTINUE POPS FOR BOTH
DAYS WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES ON TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN THE BEST LIFT
AND MOISTURE SHOULD ARRIVE. A STRONG LOW LEVEL JET IS ALSO
EXPECTED WITH THE FRONT WITH THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS RECEIVING THE
STRONGEST WINDS ON TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. WINDS SHOULD DECREASE ON
WEDNESDAY. FAIRLY WARM TEMPERATURES SHOULD LIMIT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS
DURING THE NIGHTTIME HOURS TO MAINLY THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. HIGH
PRESSURE RETURNS PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY. A SHORTWAVE
TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE AND
LIFT STAY MAINLY TO THE EAST OF THE CWA SO WILL CARRY ONLY SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. WITH THE COLDER TEMPERATURES...THERE WILL BE A
BETTER CHANCE FOR SNOW ON FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT MOISTURE IS LIMITED.
HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR SATURDAY AND
SUNDAY. WARM TEMPERATURES AT THE START OF THE PERIOD THEN COOLING
OFF BY THE END...BUT MEX GUIDANCE NUMBERS MAY BE ON THE HIGH SIDE
SO STAYED CLOSER TO HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY GENERALLY ALONG 
THE NORTHERN TN BORDER...WITH SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS AGAIN CREATING 
UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO LINGER AROUND THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 
TUESDAY...HELPING (ALONG WITH UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVES) TO TRIGGER 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. MODELS 
ARE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY ON TUESDAY...WHICH IS 
PROGGED TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY NIGHT. IT APPEARS 
THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL CREATE A GOOD SCENARIO FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF 
MOUNTAIN WAVES...AND IT APPEARS RIGHT NOW THAT IT COULD BE A HIGH 
END EVENT WITH DAMAGING WINDS IN EXCESS OF 60 MPH FOR THE MOUNTAINS 
AND THEIR IMMEDIATE FOOTHILLS. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS INDICATE 
A STRONG SOUTHERLY 850 MB JET (AROUND 70 KT) MOVING ACROSS THE AREA 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH A FAIRLY STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER (UP TO 750 
MB) AND A VEERING WIND PROFILE THAT INCREASES WITH HEIGHT. WILL ALSO 
PLAN TO MENTION A CHANCE FOR TSTORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND TUESDAY NIGHT...SINCE THE 
STRONG DYNAMICS OF THIS SYSTEM COULD COMBINE WITH SOME ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM 
AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES 
THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY WITH MAXES. WILL PLAN TO TREND 
TOWARDS WARMER TEMPS THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...SINCE BOTH SETS OF 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN TOO LOW WITH MAXES RECENTLY. ALTHOUGH 
MINS HAVE BEEN LOWER THAN GUIDANCE NUMBERS RECENTLY...WILL NOT TREND 
COOLER THAN GUIDANCE MINS SINCE DEWPOINTS HAVE RISEN WELL INTO THE 
40S ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE 
OVER THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AS A COLD FRONT EXITS THE REGION. COOLER 
AIR PUSHING IN BEHIND THE FRONT WILL ALLOW LINGERING RAIN SHOWERS TO 
MIX WITH SNOW...BUT LIMITED MOISTURE AND COVERAGE AT THIS POINT WILL 
SIGNIFICANTLY MINIMIZE THE CHANCE OF ACCUMULATIONS. DRIER...COOLER 
AIR SETTLES IN FOR THURSDAY. A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE SLIDES 
THROUGH TO OUR SOUTH ON FRIDAY. MAIN MOISTURE AND ENERGY STAY SOUTH 
BUT COULD SEE ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT.  DRY 
CONDITIONS RETURN FOR THE WEEKEND.

CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION...BUT THINK THAT 
HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE LOWER 
MS RIVER VALLEY WILL LIKELY START TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON. SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...SO THINK THAT MAXES SHOULD BE A

ADAS OBJECTIVE SURFACE TEMP/DEWPOINT ANALYSIS INDICATES A WEAK FRONT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER KENTUCKY...WITH SOUTHWESTERLY 
WINDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BRINGING UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPS. 
THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY AROUND 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AS THE UPPER- 
LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL. THIS STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BECOME 
THE FOCUS FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWER DEVELOPMENT BEGINNING ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT...AS RIPPLES OF UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE ENERGY TRAVERSE THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS CONTINUE 
TO REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY WITH 
MAXES. WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE WITH MINS...BUT WITH MAXES...WILL 
TREND CLOSER TO THE WARMER NAM NUMBERS SINCE THE GFS NUMBERS HAVE 
BEEN TOO COOL LATELY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. DEEP MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS WILL 
TRANSLATE TO WIDESPREAD RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA. 
ADDITIONALLY...STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE TUESDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN WARM ENOUGH FOR 
ALL RAIN AT ALL BUT THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS TUESDAY NIGHT. COOLER AND 
DRIER AIR FILTERS IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM FOR THURSDAY...AND REMAIN IN 
PLACE INTO THE WEEKEND.

OVER THE LOWER OHIO AND MID MS RIVER VALLEYS. THIS COLD FRONT IS

A MID AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE BUILDING OVER THE AREA
TODAY...PROVIDING MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. THE SURFACE HIGH OVER THE
AREA WILL MOVE EAST...AND LOW PRESSURE WILL TRACK ACROSS THE LOWER
GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS MAY KEEP SOME BREEZY CONDITIONS IN THE

FORECAST FOR SUNDAY. THE LOWS TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION ON SUNDAY
NIGHT AND MONDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES ON MONDAY WHEN THE
DEEPEST MOISTURE IS EXPECTED. RAIN MAY TO SNOW ON MONDAY MORNING.
BUT IT SHOULD BE LIMITED TO MAINLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SHOULD
CHANGE BACK TO ALL RAIN BY THE AFTERNOON. A FRONT ENTERS THE AREA
ON TUESDAY AND LINGERS INTO WEDNESDAY. WILL CONTINUE CHANCE POPS
FOR BOTH DAYS. FAIRLY WARM TEMPERATURES SHOULD LIMIT SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS DURING THE NIGHTTIME HOURS. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH TEMPS 
ACTUALLY WARMER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY DUE TO SOME DOWNSLOPE WARMING 
OF WEST TO NORTHWESTERLY WINDS INTO THE GREAT TN VALLEY. ANOTHER 
'CLIPPER' SYSTEM OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY IS PROGGED TO 
QUICKLY PUSH ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SATURDAY...BUT WITH LIMITED MOISTURE AHEAD OF IT. IN FACT...THIS 
COLD FRONT SHOULD STALL OUT AROUND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL ON SATURDAY. AN AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER FLORIDA WILL CREATE A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS WEEKEND...RESULTING IN ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. MODELS AGREE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH ON SUNDAY...BRINGING A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN SUNDAY NIGHT TO THE FORECAST AREA. AS 
FOR TEMPS...NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER THAN THE 
GFS NUMBERS THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THESE 
WARMER NUMBERS...SINCE THE GFS NUMBERS HAVE BEEN TOO COOL LATELY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MOVING INTO AN UNSETTLE WEATHER 
PATTERN FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED. A WEAK WAVE TRACKS 
THROUGH TO OUR SOUTH FOR MONDAY...MOISTURE AND ENERGY LIMITED AND 
WILL KEEP POPS SLIGHT CHANCE. MAIN SYSTEM MOVES IN FOR TUESDAY AND 
WILL CONTINUE TO EFFECT THE REGION INTO WEDNESDAY. DEEP MOISTURE AND 
DECENT LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM AND HAVE KEPT HIGH CHANCE 
POPS FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...SLIGHT CHANCE FOR WEDNESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LEE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A COLD FRONT OVER THE 
UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE 
SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON...BRINGING AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDINESS AHEAD OF IT. CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY 
REVELS SOME LOW CLOUDS LINGERING OVER THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY ERODE 
THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...HIGH CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD 
FRONT WILL LIKELY REPLACE THESE CLOUDS LATER THIS AFTERNOON. THUS... 
CURRENT FORECAST OF PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES APPEARS TO BE ON 
TRACK. 

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO REMOVE THE MORNING 
WORDING...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW STRATO-CU REMAINS ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA BUT IS SLOWLY ERODING. WILL CALL FOR A SLOW CLEARING
OF LOW CLOUDS TODAY...BUT INCREASING HIGH-MID CLOUDS EXPECTED BY
LATE TODAY. THE INCREASING MID-LEVEL CLOUDS WILL PRECEDE ANOTHER
NORTHERN STREAM SH0RT-WAVE MOVING TOWARD THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. 
THIS WAVE WILL PRODUCE AN AREA OF MAINLY LIGHT SNOW...POSSIBLY
MIXED WITH RAIN LATE TONIGHT-FRIDAY MORNING. THE AREA OF
PRECIPITATION WILL MAINLY EFFECT SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. LITTLE TO NO
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS...EXCEPT FOR UP TO 1 INCH ACROSS THE HIGH KNOB
AREA TOWARD DAYBREAK.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS 
NOT QUITE EAST OF THE REGION AT 12Z FRIDAY...WITH A WEAK SURFACE 
TROUGH AXIS ALSO TO PASS. HOWEVER...I CAN'T SEE MUCH PRECIPITATION 
REACHING AS FAR SOUTH AS SRN VALLEY AND SW NC...SO TOOK OUT POPS FOR 
THOSE AREAS ON FRIDAY. KEPT FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING DRY 
FOR NOW...AS THE NW FLOW ALOFT FLATTENS OUT TO A MORE ZONAL LOOK.
SRN AREAS STAY WARMER DUE GENERALLY TO LESS CLOUDS AND WARMER 850 MB 
TEMPS. 

HOWEVER...GFS AND OTHER MEDIUM TO LONG RANGE MODELS ARE SHOWING YET 
ANOTHER GULF COAST LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING ON MONDAY...THEN 
TRACKING E OR NE TOWARD THE TN VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS. GFS...
ECMWF AND GEM INDICATE SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW AND MOSTLY RAIN 
SHOWERS INTO EARLY TUESDAY NIGHT. KEPT A POSSIBLE RAIN/SNOW SHOWER 
MIX FOR EARLY WEDNESDAY...AS IT IS MUCH TOO FAR OUT TO TRY TO 
DETERMINE WHAT THE TRACK MAY TURN OUT TO BE. OF COURSE...THIS WAS A 
SHIFT AWAY FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS AND REQUIRED SOME EDITS TO SEVERAL 
GRIDS...AFTER COORDINATION WITH ADJACENT NWS OFFICES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE NORTH 
CAROLINA COAST...WITH TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE FREEZING IN THE FORECAST 
AREA BELOW 2500 FEET. AREA RADARS REVEAL THAT THE BACK EDGE OF THE 
SNOW WAS GENERALLY OVER SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...AND THE SMOKY 
MTNS...SO WILL PLAN TO CANCEL THE WINTER WX ADVISORIES FOR CENTRAL 
EAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...BUT LET THE WINTER STORM WARNING CONTINUE 
FOR SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL 7 PM. WILL ALSO DOWNGRADE 
THE WARNING ACROSS NORTHEAST TN TO AN ADVISORY FOR THE REST OF THE 
AFTERNOON...SINCE WARM SURFACE TEMPS SHOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF 
ACCUMULATIONS WITH THE LINGERING SNOWFALL. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT A QUICK-MOVING 'CLIPPER' SYSTEM WILL BRING ANOTHER 
CHANCE FOR LIGHT SNOW ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN FOR LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE FAIRLY LIMITED 
RIGHT NOW...SO WILL ONLY MENTION CHANCE POPS. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND 
GFS NUMBERS APPEAR TO BE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...DIFFICULT TO BELIEVE BUT 
WE MAY BE ABLE TO ENJOY A TWO DAY PERIOD COMPLETE WITH ZERO PRECIP 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS THE ATMOSPHERE TRANSITIONS FROM NORTHWEST 
FLOW ALOFT TO A ZONAL CONFIGURATION. ECMWF SHOWS A WEAK SHORT WAVE 
FEATURE POSSIBLY IMPACTING THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT WITH SOME 
LIGHT PRECIP. ENERGY CONTINUES TO DROP INTO A DEEPENING CENTRAL U.S. 
UPPER TROF ON TUESDAY WHILE THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM DRAGS A COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT. APPLIED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW 
TUESDAY WITH SNOW TUESDAY NIGHT AT THIS TIME BECAUSE MODELS STILL 
HAVE NOT CONVERGED ON A SOLUTION. FORECAST A DRY WEDNESDAY BEHIND 
THIS SYSTEM. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO THE NEW MEX MOS TEMP 
GUIDANCE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF WEDNESDAY. UNDERCUT GUIDANCE TEMPS BY 
SEVERAL DEGREES ON WEDNESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN ELONGATED AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
OVER THE CAROLINAS...WHICH EXTENDS NORTHWARD ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA. SURFACE TEMPS REMAIN WARM IN THE GREAT TN VALLEY 
(GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S)...WITH MOSTLY RAIN STILL 
BEING REPORTED. THIS RAIN HAS CHANGED TO SNOW ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND 
MIDDLE TN...WITH THE BACK EDGE OF THIS PRECIP AREA STILL WEST OF THE 
PLATEAU. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW (CURRENTLY 
CENTERED OVER THE MOUNTAINS) HAS COOLED THE VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILE 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...SO THAT SNOW SHOULD BE OCCURRING ACROSS 
MOST OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET. RAIN SHOULD CHANGE TO 
SNOW ACROSS THE LOWER ELEVATIONS (BELOW 2500 FEET) LATER THIS 
MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON...BUT WITH TEMPS REMAINING IN THE MID TO 
UPPER 30S...THIS SNOWFALL SHOULD HAVE A TOUGH TIME ACCUMULATING IN 
THE VALLEYS (ESPECIALLY ON THE ROADWAYS). 

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO MAINLY FRESHEN UP 
THE WORDING...BUT WILL NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE 
FORECAST OR ADVISORY/WARNING CONFIGURATION.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO TRACK 
EASTWARD THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH PRECIP TRANSITIONING TO 
SNOW ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE FEATURE. ANTICIPATE THIS PROGRESSION TO 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD WITH THE RAIN SLOWLY TRANSITIONING 
TO SNOW AS THIS PROCESS UNFOLDS. EXPECT THE TRANSITION TO SNOW TO 
COMMENCE EARLIER IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AS TEMPS ALOFT COOL TO BELOW 
FREEZING. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ON HOW MUCH SNOW WILL ACCUMULATE IN 
THE VALLEY LOCATIONS AS TEMPS ARE PROJECTED TO REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING 
AT THE SURFACE THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY BEFORE COOLING BY LATE 
AFTERNOON. NEVERTHELESS...WILL CONTINUE ADVISORIES/WARNINGS AS 
CURRENTLY CONFIGURED AS CRITERIA AMOUNTS CANNOT BE RULED OUT 
ESPECIALLY AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SNOW MELT FOR A GOOD PART OF THE DAY
AND ANY LIGHTER QPF THAN THOUGHT EARLIER...COULD CUT ACTUAL SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS IN HALF FOR ADVISORY AREAS...AS WELL AS THE LOWER
ELEVATIONS OF THE WARNING AREAS. 

MOISTURE CUTS OFF RATHER QUICKLY BEHIND DEPARTING SYSTEM IN THE 
SECOND PERIOD. THUS HAVE CUT BACK POPS IN VALLEY LOCATIONS. TEMPS 
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO COOL AS NORTHWESTERLY FLOW SETS IN. FOR 
TEMPS...MET/MAV GUIDANCE FAIRLY CLOSE AND LOOKS REASONABLE. 
GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM THOSE VALUES.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...WEATHER PATTERN SETTLES
DOWN CONSIDERABLY FOR THESE PERIODS...BUT PATTERN IS RATHER NOISY
AND UNCERTAIN FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...WITH A TRACE EVENT OF SOME
SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES POSSIBLE THOSE DAYS. MAINTAINED CONTINUITY
WITH SOME CLOUDS...BUT POPS BELOW 15 PERCENT FOR DAYS 6 AND 7.

I DID NUDGE POPS UP ACROSS EXTREME NE AREAS LATE THURSDAY NIGHT
INTO FRIDAY MORNING. MODELS HINT AT A VERY WEAK UPPER LEVEL
DISTURBANCE PASSING ESE IN THE W TO NW FLOW ALOFT. HOWEVER...I
DON'T SEE THIS AS ANY TYPE OF A NW FLOW ALOFT EVENT...GIVEN LOW
LEVEL WIND DIRECTION AND HARDLY ANY STEEP LAPSE RATES/INSTABILITY.
THIS WOULD MAINLY AFFECT SW VA AND THE NE TIP OF E TN.

ONE OTHER MINOR CHANGE WAS TO TWEAK TEMPS FOR FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY
WITH MODELS SHOWING SOME LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION (UP TO 850 MB
LEVEL) ACROSS SRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHILE NRN AREAS
EXPERIENCE MORE CLOUDS AND NEUTRAL OR WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION.

.DISCUSSION...
SOME ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE NEEDED TO THE TIMING OF THE ADVISORY FOR
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO SNOW AMOUNTS.
THE CHANGEOVER FROM RAIN TO SNOW IN THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL
OCCUR SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE MOST OF THE VALLEY...AS THE NAM
INDICATES A 1500 FT DROP IN THE FREEZING LEVEL BETWEEN 09Z AND 12Z
THERE. THE REST OF THE AREA WILL LIKELY CHANGE TO SNOW BETWEEN 12Z
AND 15Z. THE AXIS OF GREATEST LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH MIDLEVEL
FRONTOGENESIS WILL PASS OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA DURING
THIS TIME. TEMPERATURES WILL BE HOVERING RIGHT AROUND OR JUST ABOVE
FREEZING FOR MUCH OF THE DAY TOMORROW OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS...SO
WHILE SNOWFALL RATES MAY BE MODERATE TO HEAVY AT TIMES...SURFACE
MELTING WILL HELP LIMIT ACCUMULATIONS ON THE GROUND. WILL CUT A
LITTLE OFF THE HIGH END OF FORECAST SNOW AMOUNTS...WITH A MAXIMUM
OF 6 POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA. THE UPDATED WSW
WILL BE OUT SHORTLY.

DRIER WEATHER RETURN ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  STAYED NEAR MAV GUIDANCE 
FOR TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LONG TERM PERIOD OVERALL 
IS A LOWER THAN AVERAGE CONFIDENCE FORECAST.  ONE REASON IS THE LACK 
OF GOOD MODEL AGREEMENT/CONSISTENCY AND ANOTHER IS THAT WE ARE

TODAY SHOULD BE MAINLY RAIN.  WILL LEAVE CURRENT POPS AS IS.  
TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. WILL UPDATE 
FORECAST TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING...NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CONFIDENCE HIGHER FOR
WEATHER TODAY AND TONIGHT...AS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS UNDERWAY OVER
THE WRN GULF COAST REGION THIS MORNING. I LIKE THE WAY THE GFS
SPREADS A LARGE AREA OF RAIN NE TODAY...SO TRENDED WITH THE HIGHER
GFS POPS OVER LOWER NAM MOS. NO BIG THREAT OF WINTRY PCPN THIS
MORNING...AS 08Z TEMPS WERE VERY MILD ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST
AREA...BUT A CHANCE OF SNOW WORDING IS IN THE FORECAST WHERE
APPROPRIATE.  

SE FLOW DEVELOPS TONIGHT AND THERE MAY BE A BRIEF DRY SLOT THIS
EVENING...PARTIALLY ASSOCIATED WITH DOWNSLOPING INTO PARTS OF THE
VALLEY. AS LOW LIFTS NE...THE RAIN WILL SPREAD OVER THE ENTIRE
FORECAST AREA. FORECAST GRIDS MORE IN LINE WITH GFS BLENDED WITH
GEM AND SREF PER HPC DISCUSSIONS. NAM WAS SLOWER IN ADVECTING COLD
AIR IN ON WEDNESDAY...BUT NOT FOLLOWED. MAIN PCPN TYPE TONIGHT
STAYS RAIN...ALTHO FAR NW PLATEAU AREAS INTO LEE AND WISE COUNTIES
COULD MIX WITH SNOW LATE. CHANGING TO SNOW AFTER 15 TO 18Z
WEDNESDAY...AND THERE MAY BE A BRIEF PERIOD WITH SOME TYPE OTHER
THAN RAIN/SNOW.

ALTHOUGH I STILL HAVE MAJOR CONCERNS WITH SOME SNOW MELTING ON
WEDNESDAY...THE SREF QPF AMOUNTS (AFTER AIRMASS COOLS SUFFICIENTLY
FOR SNOW) SUGGEST POSSIBLE 2 TO 5 OR 3 TO 6 INCH SNOW AMOUNTS BY
WEDNESDAY EVENING ACROSS SW VA...NRN AND SMOKY MTNS OF E TN. THUS  
AFTER COORDINATION WITH NWS NEIGHBORS...I HAVE POSTED A WINTER STORM 
WATCH FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 1 AM EST THURSDAY MORNING. THIS IS 
SOMEWHAT IN LINE WITH HPC INTERNAL SNOW AMOUNT GRAPHICS FOR THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...AN AREA OF PRESSURE IS EXPECTED 
TO APPROACH THE AREA TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. SOME DIFFERENCES IN TIMING 
WITH THE NAM THE SLOWEST AND FURTHEST SOUTH.  WILL KEEP ONLY SLIGHT  
CHANCE FOR TONIGHT AND ANY THING THAT FALLS SHOULD BE LIGHT WITH THE 
DRY LOW LEVELS IN PLACE. THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE APPROACHES ON 
TUESDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE SOUTH...WHERE THE 
DEEPEST MOISTURE AND LIFT ARRIVES. FAIRLY WARM ON TUESDAY. SO ANY 
SNOW ACCUMULATION SHOULD BE LIGHT AND MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...BUT IT SHOULD MELT BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. STAYED NEAR 
MAV GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...VERY DIFFICULT 
FORECAST FOR THE TUE NIGHT AND WED TIME FRAME.  MODELS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT THAT A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL TRACK NORTHEAST FROM THE 
GULF COAST AREA TO OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST.  AT THIS POINT IT 
LOOKS LIKE THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE MAINLY RAIN EVEN OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...AS MODEL THERMAL PROFILES SHOW 
DEEP ABOVE FREEZING AIR.  THINGS GET TRICKIER FOR WEDNESDAY AS THE 
SURFACE LOW WILL BE FURTHER EAST.  COLDER AIR WILL START TO FILTER 
IN...AND THE MODELS...ESPECIALLY THE GFS...HINT AT A PERIOD OF  
STRONG LIFT AND ASSOCIATED DYNAMIC COOLING.  THIS SHOULD CHANGE THE 
PRECIP OVER TO ALL SNOW OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT IN THE VALLEY 
STILL A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY WHETHER THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL COOL 
ENOUGH FOR SNOW...AND ESPECIALLY ANY ACCUMULATION.  FOR NOW WILL 
INCLUDE RAIN OR SNOW IN THE FORECAST.  SNOW AMOUNTS MAY BE ENOUGH 
FOR WARNING CRITERIA IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT STILL FOURTH 
PERIOD AND CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO ISSUE A WATCH...SO FOR NOW 
WILL CONTINUE SPS OUTLOOK.  AFTER THIS MAIN SYSTEM...APPEARS THERE 
WILL BE SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THAT MAY BRING SOME

1000 AM EST MON JAN 24 2011

.DISCUSSION...RADAR INDICATING A FEW CLOUDS BUT NO PRECIPITATION. IT 
SHOULD REMAIN DRY THE REST OF TODAY. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF 
THE FORECAST ON TRACK. WILL UPDATE ZONES TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING.  
NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION... 

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...JET STREAM ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS MORNING WITH SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT ENHANCING CLOUDS A 
BIT...AND CREATING A FEW SPOTS OF VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION IN THE 
FORM OF LIGHT SNOW/FLURRIES OR SPOTS OF LIGHT RAIN WHERE SURFACE 
TEMPS AND 850 MB TEMPS HAVE WARMED ENOUGH (MURPHY NC - RHP). NAM 
MODEL SHOWS THIS LIFT WEAKENING OR EXITING FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING...SO I LIMITED POPS TO 20 PERCENT OR LESS AND JUST UP TO 15Z 
TODAY. MODELS AND MOS HAVE OVERDONE THE AMOUNT OF CLOUDS DURING THE 
DAY LATELY...SO I ALLOWED FOR SOME PARTIAL CLEARING IN THE AFTERNOON 
ESPECIALLY FOR VALLEY AND EASTERN AREAS. THE SUNSHINE SHOULD HELP 
TEMPS TO WARM TO NEAR SIMILAR MOS HIGHS...WHICH WILL ACTUALLY BE 
QUITE CLOSE TO SEASONAL NORMALS FOR A CHANGE.

FOR TONIGHT...HPC GUIDANCE FAVORING A 00Z GFS/00Z ECMWF COMPROMISE 
WITH LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
REGION. MODELS HAVE SHOWN LITTLE AGREEMENT OR CONTINUITY FROM RUN TO 
RUN...BUT THIS COMPROMISE SHOULD KEEP MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION 
(PCPN) OUT OF OUR REGION UNTIL LATER ON TUESDAY (MOVING IN FROM THE 
SOUTH). SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS AND MAY KEEP HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS AS WARM OR WARMER THAN VALLEY...AS PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID 
ALREADY REFLECTED. 

WE PLAN TO ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT...ALTHO THERE REMAINS A 
GOOD DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY ON HOW MUCH SNOW OCCURS AND WHEN. THE GFS 
WITH ECMWF BLEND SEEMS TO LIMIT MOST SNOW ACCUMULATION TO DAYTIME 
HOURS WEDNESDAY...A RATHER SHORT PERIOD OF TIME...SO FORECAST GRIDS 
REFLECT THIS THINKING WITH A LITTLE LESS SNOWFALL TOTALS THAN BEFORE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MADE SOME CHANGES WITH THE
TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY PART OF THE FORECAST. SLOWED THE TIMING
OF THE COLDER AIR MASS WITH NO SIGNIFICANT SNOW UNTIL LATE TUESDAY
NIGHT OR WEDNESDAY MORNING. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS COMING MORE IN
LINE WITH DEVELOPMENT OF MAIN SYSTEM TUESDAY TAKING SHAPE ALONG THE
CENTRAL GULF COAST. THE SURFACE LOW MOVES EAST ALONG THE GULF COAST
TUESDAY AND THEN DEEPENS AS IT MOVES NE ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST
WEDNESDAY. PRECIPITATION WILL INCREASE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT
AND AS COLDER AIR WRAPS INTO THE DEEPENING SYSTEM TUESDAY NIGHT AND
WEDNESDAY RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW WITH LIGHT SNOWFALL AMOUNTS IN
THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AND SEVERAL INCHES IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS
LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY BEFORE ENDING WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN
THE SOUTH AND CONTINUING SNOW SHOWERS THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT
AS TROUGHING DEVELOPS ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES AND SHORTWAVE
ENERGY MOVES SOUTHEAST INTO THE REGION.

HIGHER PRESSURE WILL STILL BE OVER THE MID ATLANTIC TUESDAY
MORNING WITH DRY AIR MASS EXTENDING SOUTHWEST INTO THE NORTHERN PART
OF THE FORECAST AREA. LIGHT PRECIPITATION MAY BE OVER THE SOUTHERN
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA IN THE FORM OF A LITTLE SNOW EARLY
TUESDAY ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE GULF SYSTEM BEFORE CHANGING TO
RAIN AS WARMING TEMPERATURES FROM SOUTHERLY FLOW AROUND THE SURFACE
LOW BRINGS TEMPERATURES UP INTO THE 40S TO NEAR 50. FREEZING LEVELS
EXPECTED TO BE 6 TO 8 THOUSAND FEET SO EVEN AT HIGHEST ELEVATIONS
MOSTLY RAIN. TUESDAY NIGHT THE MORE DEVELOPED SYSTEM WILL START TO
WRAP IN COLDER AIR WITH LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE BY
MORNING HIGHER ELEVATIONS. LOWS WEDNESDAY MORNING MOSTLY LOW TO MID
30S. WEDNESDAY DROPPED KEPT HIGHS ON THE COLD SIDE BUT STILL HIGH
ENOUGH THAT MOST LOCATIONS WILL SEE ONLY LIGHT SNOWFALL
ACCUMULATIONS...LESS THAN ONE INCH. HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 OR
3000 FEET SHOULD SEE MORE SNOW WITH TEMPERATURES STAYING AT
FREEZING OR BELOW. PRECIPITATION SHOULD END IN THE AFTERNOON IN THE
SOUTH BUT CONTINUE MOUNTAINS AND NORTH OVERNIGHT. SO THE HIGHEST
ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE THERE. AS ANOTHER IMPULSE MOVES SOUTHEAST
FROM THE MIDWEST THURSDAY SOME MORE LIGHT SNOW POSSIBLE. SATURDAY
AND SUNDAY WITH NW FLOW TO CONTINUE AND TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL
SMALL CHANCES OF RAIN AND SNOW ARE STILL IN FORECAST.

TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. KEPT 
LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING

SHORT RANGE MODELS TRENDING MOSTLY DRY FOR TONIGHT...ALTHO ECMWF 
STILL SUPPORTS VERY LOW POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT. DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM FOR TUESDAY GENERALLY SLOWER TO EVOLVE...AND I SEE THREAT OF 
ANY MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION NO HIGHER THAN 20 PERCENT. LOWERED POPS 
SLIGHTLY TO STAY LESS THAN CHANCE. CLOUDS AND WEAK SW LOW LEVEL FLOW 
FAVOR MILDER MOS MINS WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE MID 
ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEAST STATES WILL SLOWLY SHIFT EAST MONDAY AND 
MONDAY NIGHT. TWO WEATHER SYSTEMS WILL BEGIN AFFECTING THE REGION 
MONDAY. A NORTHERN SYSTEM DEVELOPING ACROSS THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES 
AND A LOW PRESSURE AREA FORMING ALONG THE TEXAS COAST. THE NORTHERN 
SYSTEM WILL BRING SOME MOISTURE ACROSS THE REGION WITH A WEAK WARM 
FRONT WHICH SHOULD DEVELOP A LITTLE LIGHT RAIN OR SNOW EARLY MONDAY. 
NAM/ECMWF DEVELOPS THE SOUTHERN SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL GULF STATES 
MONDAY NIGHT AND THEN INTO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY TUESDAY. DEEPENING 
LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES OFF THE COAST BY WEDNESDAY AND THEN UP THE 
EAST COAST. THE TRACK OF THE SURFACE LOW WILL INFLUENCE THE SNOWFALL 
AMOUNTS. SO THERE STILL IS UNCERTAINTY WITH AMOUNTS TUESDAY NIGHT

TEMPERATURES MONDAY AND TUESDAY. NO SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL EXPECTED 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AND ONLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER

HIGHEST SNOWFALL AMOUNTS. PRECIPITATION WILL DECREASE FROM SW TO NE 
WEDNESDAY BUT SNOW SHOWERS WILL LINGER ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS AND

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL PASS EAST 
THROUGH THE REGION LATE THIS MORNING...WITH CLOUDS DECREASING AND 
GIVING WAY TO AT LEAST PARTIAL SUNSHINE THIS AFTERNOON. I CAN'T 
IMAGINE MUCH SNOW COVER LEFT TODAY TO BE MELTED...BASED ON LAST 
VISIBLE SATELLITE PIC FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THUS...MAX TEMP FOR 
TODAY WAS NUDGED UP CLOSE TO A MOS BLEND.

UPPER FLOW FLATTENS TONIGHT WITH SOME TROUGHING UPSTREAM OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS TOWARD DAYBREAK SUNDAY...SO MID AND HIGH CLOUDS ARE 
LIKELY TO INCREASE AFTER MIDNIGHT. THESE CLOUDS MAKE MIN TEMP 
FORECAST TRICKY (SIMILAR TO CLOUD COVER EFFECTS THIS MORNING). BEST 
CHOICE WAS A BLEND OF MOS MINS BETWEEN THE COLDER GFS MOS AND 
SLIGHTLY NOT AS COLD NAM MOS. 

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER FLOW SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT IS MORE ZONAL WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER EASTERN STATES INCLUDING 
THE SOUTHEAST. WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
MOVING INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY WILL INCREASE MOISTURE GRADUALLY 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY CLOUDY SUNDAY. SUNDAY 
NIGHT THIS FIRST SYSTEM WEAKENS BUT WILL CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
SNOW FOR THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MONDAY TROUGH 
DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN STATES WITH SHORTWAVE ENERGY DROPPING 
SOUTH FROM THE MIDWEST INTO THE OHIO AND TN VALLEY LATE MONDAY AND 
MONDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 40S LOWER 
ELEVATIONS AND 30S HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WINDS INCREASING FROM THE 
SOUTH. PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE MIXED WITH NO SIGNIFICANT SNOW 
MONDAY. MONDAY PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS INCREASED WITH LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS BY TUESDAY MORNING MAINLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MODELS 
GET SYSTEM MORE DEVELOPED TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT WITH NAM/ECMWF 
DEVELOPING LOW ALONG CENTRAL GULF COAST SHIFTING TO THE ATLANTIC AND 
DEEPENING RAPIDLY AS IT MOVES NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THIS 
COULD MEAN SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL FOR THE FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY 
EVENING CONTINUING INTO WEDNESDAY. EXPECTING COLDER TEMPERATURES 
TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LATER SHIFTS WILL NEED TO 
EXAMINE THIS PERIOD CLOSELY ESPECIALLY WITH SNOWFALL AMOUNTS. 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY ROTATING AROUND NE STORM WILL KEEP CLOUDS AND SNOW 
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES POSSIBLE THROUGH THURSDAY WITH DRYING FRIDAY.

845 PM EST THU JAN 20 2011

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER WEST 
VA...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWARD GENERALLY 
ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS. TEMPS WERE STILL IN THE UPPER 
30S TO LOWER 40S ACROSS A LARGE PART OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT HAVE 
FALLEN BELOW FREEZING ON THE PLATEAU AND AREAS FURTHER WEST. AS A 
RESULT OF THESE WARM TEMPS...THE INITIAL PRECIP HAS BEEN MOSTLY 
RAIN OR SLEET...BUT THIS RAIN/SLEET SHOULD QUICKLY CHANGE TO SNOW AS 
COLDER AIR CONTINUES TO QUICKLY ADVECT INTO THE REGION. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT THE BULK OF THE PRECIP WILL OCCUR BEFORE MIDNIGHT... 
WHICH SEEMS TO AGREE WITH THE CURRENT TRENDS ON AREA RADARS. LATEST 
RUC AND GFS MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE VERTICAL THERMAL 
PROFILE WILL REMAIN COLD ENOUGH OVERNIGHT FOR MOSTLY SNOW. THUS... 
WILL PLAN TO REMOVE THE MENTION OF PATCHY FREEZING DRIZZLE TOWARDS 
SUNRISE. HOWEVER...WITH TEMPS RAPIDLY FALLING BELOW FREEZING...THINK 
THAT ROADWAYS COULD STILL BECOME ICY OVERNIGHT DUE TO THE FREEZING 
OF ANY LINGERING MOISTURE ON THE ROADS.

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO FRESHEN UP THE 
WORDING OF THE PRECIP TIMING...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING 
TO THE LATEST TRENDS. WILL LEAVE THE ADVISORY AREA THE SAME FOR NOW. 
FOR THOSE AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE ADVISORY...HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE 
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO MENTION MAINLY AN INCH OF SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS.

AT THIS TIME.  NEXT SYSTEM FORECAST TO AFFECT THE AREA EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...BUT MODELS DO NOT AGREE WELL ON TIMING OR OTHER DETAILS...SO 
WILL JUST KEEP LOW POPS FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.  PRECIP TYPE 
STILL VERY QUESTIONABLE THAT FAR OUT.

NUDGED EAST OF CSV. WIDESPREAD IFR TO LIFR CONDITIONS ARE NOTED IN 
ADVANCE OF THE FRONT WITH DRIZZLE OR LIGHT RAIN QUITE COMMON. WEAK 
WESTERLY WINDS AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE (FROPA)...COULD LIFT VSBYS A 
BIT...BUT I AM NOT VERY OPTIMISTIC ON CONDITIONS IMPROVING MUCH 
UNTIL AFTER 15Z TO 18Z WEDNESDAY. 

OTHERWISE...LOW LEVELS COOL BEHIND FROPA...AND WE MIGHT SEE A 
TRANSITION TO LIGHT SNOW AT TRI TOWARD AND AFTER DAYBREAK...BEFORE

.DISCUSSION...QUICK UPDATE TO LOWER POPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.
SURFACE DATA AND 19/00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW FRONT HAS LITTLE PUSH
LEFT AT THIS TIME...SO I LOOK FOR MORE DRIZZLE THAN RAIN OR SNOW
EARLY TONIGHT. KEPT A MIX WITH LIGHT SNOW LATE...OR FREEZING RAIN
IN A SPOT OR TWO. HOWEVER...I SEE LITTLE CHANCE OF SIGNIFICANT
WINTRY PCPN OVERNIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A COLD RAIN HAS SPREAD ACROSS 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 
EXTREME NORTHEAST CORNER...BUT THIS AREA WILL SEE LIGHT RAIN IN THE 
NEXT HOUR. TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN STEADY IN THE LOWER TO MID 40S 
WITH DEW POINTS RISING TO THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S. RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN LIGHT LESS THAN ONE TENTH OF AN INCH PER HOUR... 
WITH TOTAL RAINFALL AMOUNTS POSSIBLY AS HIGH AS ONE HALF INCH 
ESTIMATED BY RADAR BUT MORE LIKELY ONE QUARTER INCH OR LESS. CURRENT 
SHORT RANGE MODELS SHOWS STEADY RAIN TO CONTINUE INTO THE EARLY 
EVENING AND THEN TAPER OFF FROM SW TO NE. BACK EDGE OF RAIN ON OHX 
RADAR NEAR NASHVILLE. GFS FASTER WITH MOVING PRECIPITATION OUT 
TONIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY WITH NAM SLIGHTLY SLOWER. LOW PRESSURE 
AREA NOW ACROSS EASTERN LAKES INTO WESTERN KY WITH COLD FRONT STILL 
ACROSS WESTERN TN WHERE TEMPERATURES ARE STILL IN THE UPPER 40S. 
COLDER AIR MASS BACK ACROSS IL AND MO AND EXPECTED TO REACH FORECAST 
AREA LATE TONIGHT OR WEDNESDAY MORNING. TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY FALL 
VERY SLOWLY TONIGHT AND STAY JUST ABOVE FREEZING EXCEPT HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. AS FREEZING LEVELS DROP LATE TONIGHT A LITTLE SNOW IS 
POSSIBLE AND POSSIBLY FREEZING DRIZZLE/RAIN EARLY WEDNESDAY BEFORE 
PRECIPITATION ENDS. DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE ANY ICING PROBLEMS 
TONIGHT OR WEDNESDAY. EXPECT ONE INCH OR LESS OF SNOW IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. WEDNESDAY AS DRIER COLDER AIR MASS MOVES IN SKIES SHOULD 
BECOME SUNNY TO PARTLY SUNNY WEST AND CENTRAL SECTIONS BUT BE SLOW 
TO CLEAR NE. TEMPERATURES SIMILAR TO TODAYS...BUT A FEW DEGREES 
COLDER NE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND SHOW A COLD FRONT AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA DURING 
THE THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY PERIOD WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
AFFECTING THE AREA EARLY NEXT WEEK. WHILE THE GFS AND NAM MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THE COLD FRONT FOR THURSDAY 
NIGHT...THEY ARE REVEALING SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE VERTICAL 
THERMAL PROFILE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...THE COLDER GFS 
MODEL REVEALS MORE SNOW THAN THE WARMER NAM MODEL. TEMPS ARE 
EXPECTED TO WARM INTO THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S AHEAD OF THIS FRONT 
BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...SO WILL PLAN TO MENTION MOSTLY RAIN IN THE 
EVENING BUT CHANGING TO SNOW AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH THIS COLD FRONT 
EXPECTED TO QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA...THINK THAT ANY 
POTENTIAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY MORNING SHOULD BE 
ON THE LIGHT SIDE (AROUND 1 TO 3 INCHES). BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SWINGING ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...BUT WITH VERY 
LIMITED AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE. THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION A DRY 
FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AROUND THE 
TN/OHIO RIVER VALLEYS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...WHICH COULD LINGER OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR A COUPLE OF DAYS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND 
TOWARDS THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH TONIGHT.  RAIN WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA AHEAD OF THE FRONT 
TODAY...AND PRECIP WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT BUT WILL BE TAPERING OFF 
FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST.  LOOKS LIKE PRECIP WILL BE WINDING DOWN 
AS COLDER AIR MOVES IN...SO LOOKS LIKE PRIMARILY A RAIN EVENT 
THROUGH TONIGHT FOR LOWER ELEVATION AREAS.  HIGHER MOUNTAINS WILL 
LIKELY TRANSITION TO SNOW MUCH MORE QUICKLY AS FREEZING LEVELS 
DROP...SO MAY HAVE SOME MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.   AT THIS TIME IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE ENOUGH TO WARRANT A 
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY...BUT DAY SHIFT WILL HAVE ANOTHER LOOK.  
FREEZING RAIN THREAT LOOKS MINIMAL FOR LOWER ELEVATION AREAS...AS 
TEMPS WILL LIKELY STAY ABOVE FREEZING IN MOST LOCATIONS...SO WILL 
NOT MENTION IN FORECAST FOR NOW.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV 
TEMPS.    

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...TUESDAY/S LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO PULL AWAY FROM THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY...BUT 
MAY SEE A FEW SNOW SHOWERS LINGERING OVER THE FAR NORTHERN AND 
EASTERN AREAS INTO THE MORNING.  WILL BRIEFLY BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS 
FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE FIRST PART OF THURSDAY.  THE NEXT 
SYSTEM...A COLD FRONT...MOVES IN LATE THURSDAY OR THURSDAY NIGHT.  
DEEP MOISTURE...GOOD DYNAMICS AND MUCH COOLER AIR ACCOMPANIES THE 
SYSTEM.  WILL CONTINUE THE HIGH CHANCE POPS OVERNIGHT AS ASSOCIATED 
RAIN SHOWERS CHANGE OVER TO SNOW THURSDAY NIGHT.  COULD SEE SOME 
SNOW ACCUMULATION ACROSS THE AREA AS THE FRONT SLIDES THROUGH.   
SOME RESIDUAL SNOW SHOWERS WILL LINGER INTO FRIDAY WITH TEMPERATURES 
STRUGGLING TO REACH THE LOWER 30S ACROSS THE TN VALLEY.  A WARMING 
AND DRYING TREND EXPECTED FOR THE WEEKEND.  THERE IS A QUESTION FOR 
MONDAY WITH MODELS TRENDED TOWARD BRINGINGANOTHER COLD FRONT THROUGH 
THE REGION.  FOR NOW...HAVE LEFT THINGS DRY UNTIL HIGHER CONFIDENCE

430 AM EST MON JAN 17 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT IN 
DEPICTION OF WEAK LOW PRESSURE THAT MOVES BY WELL TO OUR SOUTH 
TODAY/EARLY TONIGHT...WITH NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHING LATE TONIGHT.  
HOWEVER...THEY DIFFER IN THE DETAILS.  GFS MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE IN 
BRINGING PRECIP INTO OUR AREA...BUT IS NOT HANDLING CURRENT PRECIP 
VERY WELL.  NAM/SREF SOLUTION SLOWER. IN FACT...00Z NAM HAS MUCH OF 
OUR AREA BASICALLY PRECIP FREE BOTH PERIODS.  WILL GO WITH MORE OF A 
BLENDED SOLUTION GIVEN UNCERTAINTY...WITH CHANCE POPS BOTH PERIODS 
EXCEPT LIKELY FAR WESTERN ZONES LATE TONIGHT. SOME RISK FOR FREEZING 
RAIN IN A FEW AREAS LATE TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST...ALTHOUGH 
FOR NOW PLAN TO GO WITH CURRENT FORECAST IDEA OF NO FREEZING 
PRECIP.  ALSO LOOKS LIKE FREEZING LEVEL MAY BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO 
HIGHEST MOUNTAIN PEAKS FOR SOME SNOW.  WILL INCLUDE THIS POSSIBILITY 
IN FORECAST FOR THESE HIGH MOUNTAIN PEAKS...BUT ANY PRECIP SHOULD BE 
QUITE LIGHT.   WILL GENERALLY GO NEAR MAV TEMPS TODAY...SLIGHTLY 
ABOVE FOR TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL DEEPEN 
INTO THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION ON TUESDAY AS IT IS SUPPLIED 
WITH A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY. ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY DRAGGING A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA LATER IN THE DAY AND DURING THE EVENING. 
CATEGORICAL PROBABILITIES FOR RAIN WILL FADE TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE 
SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT AND DEEPER MOISTURE SHIFT EAST. RAIN SHOWERS 
CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS WITH SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATION POSSIBLE IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE TENNESSEE 
STATE LINE SOUTH TO THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. PERHAPS SOME LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE IN THESE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS WEDNESDAY 
MORNING BEFORE FADING AWAY. MODELS ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT FOR LATER 
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY AS AN ALBERTA CLIPPER AND ANOTHER SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORT WAVE MOVE ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. TO THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD BY FRIDAY EVENING. LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER LIGHT PRECIP EVENT 
WITH SOME RAIN CHANGING TO SNOW SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY 
BEFORE ENDING. PULLED THE NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS OUT OF THE 
FORECAST ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WITH LATE FORECAST PERIOD MODEL 
SOLUTIONS NOT QUITE AS OPTIMISTIC FOR SUCH AN EVENT. STAYED 
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO MEX MOS GUIDANCE EXCEPT FOR THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS WELL AS MAX TEMPS ON SUNDAY. DURING THESE PERIOD 
UNDERCUT THE SUGGESTED NUMBERS BY SEVERAL DEGREES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...
VORT MAXES OVER WEST TX AND THE TX COAST WILL MERGE TONIGHT IN THE 
NORTHERN GULF TONIGHT...THEN TRACK EASTWARD. MOISTURE AHEAD OF THIS

TODAY...SUGGESTING THAT THE ONSET OF PRECIP WILL BE AFTER SUNRISE 
TOMORROW. LARGE-SCALE LIFT IS WEAK AND LOW LEVELS REMAIN DRY...SO 
PRECIP WILL BE LIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL CONTINUES WEDNESDAY AS LOW PRESSURE AREA
DEEPENS ALONG THE NE COAST AND UPPER TROUGH MOVES OUT. DO NOT
EXPECT MUCH ACCUMULATION WEDNESDAY BUT TEMPERATURES WILL BE MUCH
COOLER GENERALLY MID 30S TO MID 40S. AS FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL

FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS LOW THROUGH THE TAF PERIOD DUE TO A LACK OF
FORCING MECHANISMS FOR LIFT AND NEAR NEUTRAL ADVECTION PATTERNS.
DUE TO THE LOW CONFIDENCE...VFR CONDITIONS WILL BE FORECAST AT ALL

TONIGHT...MAINLY AT TRI. WILL BRING LOW VFR CEILINGS IN THERE LATE
TONIGHT WITH 6SM VIS...BUT LOWER CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE. ONLY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)....WEAKENING COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
INTO THE AREA BEFORE DISSIPATING.  LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL 
INCREASE...BUT FORCING WILL BE LACKING.  HAVE SEEN NO OBSERVATIONS 
OF ANY PRECIP IN AREAS WHERE GFS HAD VERY LIGHT QPF...SO WILL GO 
MORE WITH THE DRIER NAM/SREF SOLUTION AND REMOVE MENTION OF 
DRIZZLE.  NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHING TONIGHT. GFS TRIES TO BRING LIGHT 
QPF INTO WESTERN AREAS BEFORE 12Z...BUT NAM DRY AND HPC KEEPS ALL 
PRECIP WELL TO OUR SOUTHWEST.  WILL LEAN TOWARD SLOWER SOLUTION AND 
HAVE A MAINLY DRY FORECAST FOR TONIGHT...WITH JUST SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FAR WESTERN ZONES LATE. PRECIP TYPE MAY BE CLOSE AS LOW LEVEL 
TEMPS LIKELY TO BE NEAR FREEZING...SO WILL MENTION BOTH FREEZING 
RAIN AND RAIN. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS FOR THE SHORT 
TERM.   

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS NOT AS CLOSE IN 
DEPICTION OF THE LONG TERM AS I WOULD LIKE TO SEE...ESPECIALLY 
WITHIN THE FIRST 48-72 HOURS. THE WRF/ECMWF ARE SIMILAR IN SLOWER 
ARRIVAL OF DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT FOR MONDAY WITH LESS IMPACT FROM 
INITIAL DEEP SOUTH SHORT WAVE AS FORECAST AREA AWAITS HIGHER 
PROBABILITY NORTHERN SYSTEM ON TUESDAY DROPPING SOUTHEAST FROM THE 
WESTERN LAKES THROUGH THE MIDWEST AND EVENTUALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS TUESDAY NIGHT. DID SOME MINOR ADJUSTING OF THE TWO DAY 
EVENT TRYING TO HOLD BACK POPS FOR RAIN FROM EAST THROUGH WEST 
MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR SLIGHTLY BETTER TIME 
RESOLUTION ON SHORT WAVE IMPACTS. HELD ONTO THE NORTHWEST FLOW 
SNOWFALL REGIME FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS ENERGY BUILDS 
THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF DEPARTING UPPER TROF. MODEL SOLUTION 
DIVERGENCE CONTINUES LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH 
TIMING...POSITION...STRENGTH OF SHORT WAVE FOR THE THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY TIME FRAME. TRIED TO JUST STAY THE COURSE HERE WITH SLIGHT 
AND SMALL CHANCE POPS WITH THE RAIN/SNOW MIX CONCEPT TRANSITIONING 
INTO A NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW REGIME AS ARCTIC AIR SPILLS SOUTH LATE IN 
THE WEEK. DUE TO INCREASING UNCERTAINTY AT THE END OF THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD...JUST KEPT SATURDAY DRY AWAITING BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT IN 
THE NEXT FEW RUNS. THE TEMPERATURE SCHEME WILL PROBABLY NEED SOME 
FUTURE ADJUSTING WITH THE ECMWF NOT SO EXCITED ABOUT AN ARCTIC

.DISCUSSION...
MIDLEVEL CLOUDS ARE INCREASING ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE
AREA AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. THIS WILL
NECESSITATE AN INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER...FROM PARTLY SUNNY WORDING
TO MOSTLY CLOUDY IN THE NORTH. THE SOUTHERN HALF SHOULD STAY MOSTLY
SUNNY THROUGH THE DAY. SLIGHT TEMPERATURE ADJUSTMENTS WILL ALSO BE
MADE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER. MOST LOCATIONS WILL
SEE HIGHS IN THE 40S...WITH UPPER 30S NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS.

430 AM EST SAT JAN 15 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION WILL 
GIVE WAY TO A WEAKENING COLD FRONT THAT WILL PUSH IN TONIGHT.  
LIMITED MOISTURE AND FORCING WITH THIS WEAK FRONT...SO EXPECT VERY 
LITTLE IN THE WAY OF PRECIP...WITH BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  WILL 
CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH...AND KEEP REMAINDER OF THE AREA 
PRECIP FREE TONIGHT.  PRECIP TYPE FOR ANY PRECIP THAT DOES FALL IS 
PROBLEMATIC.  MAY NOT BE COLD ENOUGH IN THE CLOUD LAYER TO SUPPORT 
ICE CRYSTALLIZATION...SO MAY BE ONLY VERY LIGHT RAIN/FREEZING RAIN.  
HOWEVER...GIVEN UNCERTAINTY...WILL MENTION SNOW POSSIBILITY AS 
WELL.  AGAIN...VERY LITTLE PRECIP EXPECTED.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAINTAINED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
PRECIP ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE ON 
SUNDAY AS WEAKENING IMPULSE SLIDES EAST SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY AND THROUGH THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. NOT MUCH OF AN EVENT WITH 
LIMITED MOISTURE SO JUST KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE FREEZING RAIN OR 
SNOW CONCEPT GOING HERE DURING THE MORNING WITH COLD OVERNIGHT MIN 
TEMPS. THANKS TO BETTER MODEL RESOLUTION DUE TO PROXIMITY OF NEXT 
EVENT...WAS ABLE TO REMOVE THE SUNDAY NIGHT POP FOR ALMOST THE 
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. ECMWF/GFS BRING SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE INTO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN STATES ON MONDAY WHILE NORTHERN STREAM UPPER LEVEL JET 
STRENGTHENS ON THE BACK SIDE OF CENTRAL U.S. TROUGH. DEEPER LIFT AND 
MOISTURE AND WILL BE AVAILABLE AS THIS AMPLIFYING SYSTEM DRIVES EAST 
TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY SO 
HELD ONTO LIKELY POPS FOR THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. IT APPEARS 
PRECIP DOESN'T GET STARTED UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY FOR THE COLDEST 
PART OF THE FORECAST AREA INCLUDING SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE SO DID NOT HAVE TO APPLY WINTERY MIX HERE DUE TO EXPECTED 
WARMING BY AFTERNOON. WILL CHECK PRECIP TIMING IN LATER ZONE 
ISSUANCE TO SEE IF THIS CHANGES. COLDER AIR SPILLS INTO THE REGION 
AGAIN TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY FOR A PERIOD OF NORTHWEST FLOW 
SNOW SHOWER ACTION. NOT MUCH OF A BREAK BEFORE NEXT UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH PRESSES EAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA WITH ASSOCIATED ARCTIC 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. LOOKS LIKE A RAIN/SNOW MIX ON THE FRONT SIDE WITH 
SNOW SHOWERS BUILDING IN BEHIND LATE THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT AS 
THE FRIGID AIRMASS STREAMS SOUTHEAST. KEPT A FEW MOUNTAIN SNOW 
SHOWERS GOING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ON FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE THAT HAS BEEN CENTERED OVER OUR AREA TODAY
WILL DRIFT SOUTHWARD TONIGHT. LOW PRESSURE TRACKING ACROSS THE
GREAT LAKES WILL BRING A SW FLOW TOMORROW...BRINGING ADDITIONAL
WARMING TO THE AREA. AN UPPER LEVEL JET STREAK AND WEAK SHORTWAVE

WENT WITH THE COOLER GFS MOS GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES TONIGHT IN
THE TEENS AND LOW 20S...BUT SHAVED A COUPLE DEGREES OF GFS MOS FOR
HIGHS TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAKENING SYSTEM
OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY IS LOOKING EVEN WEAKER TODAY
AND WILL SAG INTO THE NORTHERN FORECAST AREA EARLY SUNDAY AND THEN
WEAKENING AND MOVING EAST LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. EXPECT A
FEW SPRINKLES...LIGHT SNOW AND POSSIBLY MIXED WITH LIGHT FREEZING
RAIN OR DRIZZLE ACROSS EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA AND NORTHERN PLATEAU
MAINLY EARLY SUNDAY. LOWS SATURDAY NIGHT WITH CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS
AND STARTING OUT FROM WARMER HIGHS WILL ONLY COOL INTO THE MID 20S
TO AROUND FREEZING AND MAY ACTUALLY WARM A FEW DEGREES OVERNIGHT.
SUNDAY THE LIGHT PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE BUT TEMPERATURES WILL
STAY ABOVE FREEZING. SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER TEXAS SUNDAY WILL
SPREAD MORE SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY MONDAY
NIGHT AND JOIN WITH MORE DEVELOPED NORTHERN SYSTEM OVER THE
NORTHERN PLAINS AS IT MOVES INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY
TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARM ENOUGH FOR PRECIPITATION TO BE
MOSTLY RAIN. BIG DIFFERENCE WITH RAINFALL AMOUNTS WITH ECMWF MODEL
SHOWING AROUND ONE HALF INCH OF RAIN TUESDAY AND GFS SHOWING HEAVY
RAIN ON THE PLATEAU OF AROUND TWO INCHES TO ABOUT ONE INCH IN THE
EASTERN MOUNTAINS. AFTER THIS SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH TUESDAY WRAP

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
REGION WILL SHIFT SOUTHEAST DURING THE PERIOD.  SOME VERY WEAK SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY WILL BRING SOME HIGH CLOUDS ESPECIALLY TONIGHT...BUT 
OVERALL SHOULD BE A TRANQUIL SHORT TERM PERIOD.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE FOR TODAY...BUT WILL TWEAK UP A BIT MOST LOCATIONS 
FOR TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST 
CONTAINS A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY...MAINLY MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...DUE TO MODEL DIFFERENCES. WENT CLOSER TO THE NATIONAL 
CENTER PREFERENCE FOR A SOLUTION CLOSER TO THE ECMWF. THE WEEKEND 
FORECAST FEATURES A LOW AMPLITUDE WAVE THAT DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF 
CANADA ON ITS WAY ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEASTERN U.S. THE 
WAVE ENCOURAGES A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO DRIFT SOUTH THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA LATER SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. MAINTAINED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP FOR SOME RAIN/SNOW BUT TRIMMED COVERAGE AS THIS SYSTEM 
DOES NOT HAVE MUCH IN THE WAY OF LIFT AND MOISTURE FOR PRECIPITATION 
PRODUCTION. IMPROVED CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION DEVELOP BY THE 
BEGINNING OF THE WORK WEEK AND CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY AS A COUPLE 
SHORT WAVELENGTH TROUGHS AMPLIFY WEST OF THE REGION AND MAKE THEIR 
WAY ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. BY MID WEEK. THE SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE 
EMERGES FIRST DRIVING A SURFACE LOW FROM THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH FROM 12Z MONDAY TO 12Z TUESDAY. 
TRAILING BEHIND THIS FEATURE WILL BE A STRONGER NORTHERN STREAM WAVE 
AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM WHICH PRESSES EAST ACROSS THE EASTERN 
U.S. 12Z TUESDAY TO 12Z WEDNESDAY. KEPT POPS RELATIVELY HIGH WITH 
THE BEST LIKLIEHOOD FOR RAIN INCREASING LATER IN THE DAY MONDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AS ISENTROPIC LIFT STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF THE 
SOUTHERN WAVE. STAYED WITH THE WINTERY MIX IDEA FOR SUNDAY NIGHT 
INTO MONDAY AS THIS SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER A CHILLY LOW LEVEL AIRMASS. 
AS POPS DECREASE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING TRANSITIONED 
THE PRECIP FROM RAIN SHOWERS TO SNOW SHOWERS IN THE STANDARD SHIFT 
TO OROGRAPHICALLY ENHANCED SNOW IN THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MOST OF THE REGION SHOULD 
ENJOY A DRY WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS THE AREA COMES UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF HIGHER PRESSURE. ADJUSTED TEMPERATURES BELOW MEX MOS 
GUIDANCE AS ECMWF INDICATES ANOTHER SURGE OF POLAR AIR CHARGES 
SOUTHWARD ACROSS MUCH OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BEHIND THE 
EARLY WEEK STORM SYSTEM.

400 AM EST THU JAN 13 2011

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR INDICATING SNOW HAS
DECREASE AS THE SHORTWAVE EXITS THE AREA SO CANCELLED THE WINTER
WEATHER ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. BUT MODELS STILL INDICATING
AN UPSLOPE CONDITIONS INTO THE MORNING HOURS...SO EXTENDED THE
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY GOING FOR THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL 11 AM THIS
MORNING. ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD LESS THAN 3 INCHES
AND MAINLY OVER THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING
DRY WEATHER FOR TONIGHT. MORE COLD WEATHER EXPECTED TODAY AND
TONIGHT. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH A WARMING TREND 
DEVELOPING. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY ON SATURDAY NIGHT...AND BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY OR DISSIPATE 
AROUND THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY. MODELS SOUNDINGS REVEAL A 
SHALLOW SATURATED LAYER GENERALLY BELOW 850 MB...WITH THE PRECIP 
INITIATION REGION RIGHT AROUND -5 CELSIUS WHERE PRECIP MAY BEGIN AS 
EITHER RAIN OR SNOW. WITH SURFACE TEMPS EXPECTED TO FALL BELOW 
FREEZING BY SUNDAY MORNING...THINK THERE WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME FREEZING DRIZZLE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING...BUT 
MODELS AGREE THAT THIS PRECIP SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT. GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS THEN REVEAL SOME LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH THE LARGE-SCALE 
PATTERN FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED 
TO DEVELOP OVER THE PLAINS ON SUNDAY...WHICH WILL DEVELOP A SURFACE 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SOMEWHERE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS OR LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN IS FARTHER NORTH THAN THE ECMWF 
MODEL WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SURFACE LOW...AND IS CONSEQUENTLY 
WARMER OVER THE FORECAST AREA THAN THE ECMWF. SINCE BOTH MODELS HAVE 
BEEN INCONSISTENT WITH THEIR SOLUTIONS IN THE PAST FEW DAYS...WILL 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS AND BASICALLY CONTINUE WITH THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST OF RAIN FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...CHANGING TO SNOW 
TUESDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE MORE CONSISTENT ENSEMBLE MEANS 
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD... WHICH ARE COOLER THAN THE GFS 
NUMBERS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT STRETCHING SOUTHEAST ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND AL. 
AREA RADARS CURRENTLY REVEAL SOME PATCHY LIGHT PRECIP OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA...WHICH WAS REPORTED EARLIER AS FREEZING DRIZZLE AT 
CHA. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT FREEZING DRIZZLE WILL CONTINUE TO 
BE POSSIBLE UNTIL AFTER SUNRISE...WHEN THE COLD FRONT BRINGS COLDER 
AIR INTO THE REGION (ESPECIALLY IN THE UPPER LEVELS). AFTER FRONTAL 
PASSAGE...IT APPEARS THAT PRECIP SHOULD MOSTLY BE IN THE FORM OF 
SNOW. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL BE FAIRLY 
LIMITED TODAY...WITH A WESTERLY WIND FLOW THAT WILL NOT BE 
PARTICULARLY IDEAL FOR UPSLOPE PRECIP ENHANCEMENTS IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. THUS...WILL MENTION CHANCE POPS FOR MOST AREAS THROUGH

POSSIBLE. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER 
OVER SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC WHERE SNOW COVER SHOULD LIMIT ANY 
WARMING.

THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE HIGHEST POPS FOR THE 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA AND THE MOUNTAINS WHERE THE DEEPEST 
MOISTURE LINGERS ALONG WITH THE UPSLOPE CONDITIONS. COULD SEE 
ANOTHER 1-2 INCHES OF SNOW POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON 
WEDNESDAY. SHORTWAVE EXITS THE AREA BY THURSDAY BUT STILL A WEAK

ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL SHOULD BE LIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS PROVIDING 
DRY WEATHER FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. A FRONT ENTERING THE REGION ON

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE AREA NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE MS RIVER...WITH AN INVERTED 
TROUGH EXTENDING NORTH OF IT INTO MIDDLE TN. AREA RADARS REVEAL AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF SNOW MOVING NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION...WITH SOME CONVECTIVE SNOWFALL OBSERVED EARLIER 
ACROSS NORTHERN AL. NAM MODEL INDICATES SOME INSTABILITY OVER 
SOUTHEAST TN EARLY THIS MORNING...AND THEN MOVES IT EAST INTO THE 
CAROLINAS AFTER SUNRISE. THIS INSTABILITY WILL LIKELY ENHANCE SNOW 
TOTALS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...SO WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION 8 TO 12 INCHES IN THESE AREAS (INCLUDING THE MOUNTAINS). 
OTHERWISE...WILL MAINTAIN THE CURRENT ADVISORY/WARNING CONFIGURATION 
SINCE MODELS AGREE THAT PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL DECREASE QUICKLY TO THE 
NORTH OF THE WARNING AREAS. MODEL SOUNDINGS NOW INDICATE A COOLER 
VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILE FOR TODAY...BUT STILL INDICATE SOME 850 MB 
WARMING BY THE AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. ALSO...THE PRECIP INITIATION 
REGION APPEARS TO LOWER BELOW -5 CELSIUS...SO AM WORRIED THAT SNOW 
MAY CHANGE TO RAIN TONIGHT. AS A RESULT...IT APPEARS THAT SNOW MAY 
MIX WITH SLEET THIS AFTERNOON...AND FREEZING RAIN BY TONIGHT. WITH 
THIS IN MIND...WILL EXTEND THE ADVISORIES/WARNINGS FOR THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH TONIGHT...AND WILL ISSUE AN 
ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWEST VA FOR TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT 
WILL COMPROMISE WHERE DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE 
TO DEPICT A TRANSITION TO UPSLOPE EVENT THROUGH MUCH OF THE BALANCE 
OF THE WORK WEEK AS UPPER LOW SLOWLY MIGRATES THROUGH THE LOWER 
GREAT LAKES. CONTINUED DRY PERIOD FOR LATE WORK WEEK INTO EARLY 
WEEKEND AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN

333 PM EST SUN JAN 9 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...09/12Z MODELS SEEM TO
HAVE TRENDED A BIT COLDER...ESPECIALLY VIEWING NAM SOUNDINGS. THE
AMOUNT OF WARMING IN THE LOW LEVELS IS LESS...AND COULD BE RATHER
INSIGNIFICANT. A MORE INTERESTING FEATURE...WHICH COULD ACTUALLY
HINDER SNOW AMOUNTS...IS THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME E-SE DOWNSLOPE FLOW
INTO THE CENTRAL AND NRN VALLEY COUNTIES. THUS...I KEPT SOME
WORDING AS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN OR SLEET MIXING IN THE
AFTERNOON. I OPTED TO UPGRADE THE WATCH AREA FOR ROANE...LOUDON...
BLOUNT AND SEVIER COUNTIES TO A WARNING...AND REST OF THE WATCH
AREAS NORTH OF I-40 TO A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY...WHERE MODEL QPF
IS MUCH LESS. 

PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS WERE GENERALLY ON TRACK...WITH A FEW
ADJUSTMENTS. I KEPT POPS RATHER HIGH FOR MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY
MORNING FOR SW VA AND PARTS OF NE TN...AS UPPER LOW APPROACHES FROM
THE NW. THIS COULD PRODUCE ADVISORY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FOR SW VA
AND NE TN...BUT AFTER MONDAY NIGHT AND THIS FIRST SYSTEM HAS PASSED
THE REGION. LATER SHIFTS CAN LOOK INTO THIS A BIT MORE.

OTHERWISE...MAIN MOS ADJUSTMENT WAS TO UNDERCUT MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT
GIVEN THE DRY DEW POINT TEMPS...AND SOME EVAPORATIVE COOLING WHICH
SHOULD OCCUR AS PRECIPITATION DEVELOPS LATE TONIGHT. SNOW COVER
MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WOULD ALSO FAVOR COOLER THAN MOS FOR HIGHS
EACH DAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER LOW SHIFTS SLOWLY 
EAST FROM THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT TO OFF THE NEW ENGLAND 
COAST BY 00Z THU WITH TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPPING IN BEHIND 
THE DEPARTING LOW WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. LEFT THIS PERIOD OF 
THE FORECAST BASICALLY UNCHANGED AS THIS WILL BE A PERIOD OF MAINLY 
OROGRAPHIC SNOWFALL IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME THAT FAVORS THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
THE FAR EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. MAINTAINED THE DRY FORECAST FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AS CHILLY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. MODEL SOLUTIONS 
DIVERGE BY THE WEEKEND BUT GENERALLY AGREE THAT AN UPPER TROF AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL MOVE TOWARD THE AREA WITH 
IMPACT MAINLY SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. KEPT SLIGHT AND LOW 
CHANCE POPS GOING DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME RANGE. 
TEMPERATURES WILL NOT BE WARM ENOUGH DURING THIS PERIOD TO KEEP SOME 
SNOW OUT OF THE FORECAST. ONCE AGAIN UNDERCUT MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE 
DURING THE LONG TERM.

LEANING TOWARD JUST A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR E TN AREAS NORTH

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE AREA CENTERED OVER THE UPPER 
MS RIVER VALLEY... WITH ITS VERY COLD AND DRY AIR MASS EXTENDING 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
SOUTH TEXAS IS PROGGED TO MOVE EAST TODAY ACROSS THE GULF COASTAL 
REGION...AND WILL BRING INCREASING HIGH CLOUDINESS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGHOUT THE DAY. AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH 
EXTENDING NORTH OF THE LOW SHOULD HELP TO INCREASE PRECIP OVER THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY IN THE FORM OF SNOW LATER TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
LATEST RUNS OF BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS ARE NOW WARMER WITH THE 
VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILE OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR MONDAY...WITH A 
WARMER AND POTENTIALLY ABOVE FREEZING 850 MB LAYER SPREADING FURTHER 
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. BOTH MODELS INDICATE THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SNOW MIXING WITH SLEET ON MONDAY...WITH THE WARMER 
GFS MODEL EVEN INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF A CHANGEOVER TO RAIN BY 
MONDAY AFTERNOON. THUS...WILL PLAN TO KEEP THE WINTER STORM WATCH IN 
EFFECT OVER CENTRAL EAST TN AND NORTHEAST TN (NO UPGRADE 
YET)...WHERE THERE STILL REMAINS SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE AMOUNT OF 
SNOW THAT WILL BE ABLE TO ACCUMULATE DUE TO WARMING CONCERNS AND THE 
AMOUNT OF MOISTURE THAT ULTIMATELY MAKES IT THIS FAR NORTH. 
HOWEVER...WILL PLAN TO UPGRADE THE WATCH TO A WARNING ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TN...SOUTHWEST NC...AND THE SMOKIES WHERE SIGNIFICANT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS APPEAR TO BE MORE PROBABLE. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
BECOMES SITUATED ON SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF UPPER LOW AS IT MIGRATES 
THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES EARLY IN THE LONG TERM. THIS WILL KEEP AREA 
SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN TIER. UPPER LOW 
DEPARTS AND WEAK UPPER RIDGING BUILDS IN BY LATE WORK WEEK RESULTING 
IN GENERALLY DRY CONDITIONS. POOR AGREEMENT AMONG MEDIUM-RANGE 
MODELS AND WIDE SPREAD AMONG ENSEMBLE MEMBERS PRECLUDE MUCH 
CONFIDENCE IN SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES LATE IN THE LONG TERM. THUS DID 
NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST FOR 
THAT TIME FRAME. FOR TEMPS...CONTINUED TO UNDERCUT MAV/MEX

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...PRECIPITATION WINDING DOWN
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN THIS AFTERNOON...SO OPTED TO LET ADVISORIES
AND WARNINGS EXPIRE AT 4 PM EST. DECREASING CLOUDS IN GENERAL
OVERNIGHT AND CHILLY. WIND CHILL VALUES MAY DIP JUST BELOW -5
DEGREES OVER HIGHEST TERRAIN OF NORTHEAST TN AND SW VA...BUT JUST A
FEW PIXELS. SO...WITH SO MUCH WINTER WEATHER ONGOING AND OUTLOOKED 
I CHOSE NOT TO ISSUE A WIND CHILL ADVISORY...FOR SUCH A MARGINALLY
MET EVENT. 

OTHERWISE...MODELS ARE FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH GULF COAST SYSTEM
...SO JUST A FEW ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO GRIDS. I DID SPREAD THE
WATCH NORTH TO INCLUDE ALL OF E TN...WITH A LATER START AND END
TIME. SNOW AMOUNTS IN GRIDS AND WSW SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS FORECAST.
MOS TEMPS AND POPS WERE CLOSE FOR ALL 4 PERIODS AND CLOSELY
FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...INITIAL SHORT WAVE
WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE CENTER WILL BE MOVING
NORTHEAST ALONG THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC COAST MONDAY NIGHT.
CONTINUED TREND OF PUSHING HIGHER POPS FOR SNOW NORTH ACROSS THE
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AS DEEPER MOISTURE/LIFT SHIFTS
NORTHEAST TOWARD THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES. AT THE SAME
TIME...SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL BE MOVING RAPIDLY EAST INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY AND MODELS SHOW A SECONDARY AREA OF LOW PRESSURE
STRENGTHENING ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE BY 12Z TUESDAY IN RESPONSE.
THIS PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFTS ONLY SLOWLY EAST DURING THE DAY SO HELD
ONTO MEDIUM CHANCE THROUGH LIKELY POPS FOR SNOW FROM SOUTH TO
NORTH. TRENDED THE EVENT INTO A NORTHWEST FLOW OROGRAPHIC SNOW
MACHINE FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHICH FAVORS THE
MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF EAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. MAINTAINED THE DRY PERIOD FOR
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY BUT HAD TO USE SOME SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS
FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM MAY BRING MAINLY RAIN
SHOWERS TO THE AREA BUT HAD TO USE SOME SNOW SHOWER WORDING DUE TO
UNCERTAINTY WITH TEMPERATURE PROFILE SO FAR OUT IN THE FORECAST
PERIOD. UNDERCUT GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES ALL THE WAY THROUGH

ENOUGH AT THE TOP FOR GOOD SNOW GROWTH. 

ALL THIS INDICATES CURRENT FORECAST IS ON TRACK...BUT WILL FRESHEN 
AND UPDATE GRIDS BEFORE NOON...AND ALSO END THE WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORIES AT THAT TIME.

I DO SEE THE NEED FOR A WIND CHILL ADVISORY WITH THE AFTERNOON 
PACKAGE FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TONIGHT. ALSO...MAIN FOCUS WILL BE 
ON SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY SYSTEM...STAY TUNED!

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LEE TROUGH EXTENDING ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...WITH AN ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE AREA CENTERED OVER THE 
HIGH PLAINS. A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION IS 
PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE MID ATLANTIC STATES 
TODAY...AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRODUCE SOME SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS 
MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THUS...WILL PLAN 
TO KEEP THE ADVISORIES/WARNINGS IN EFFECT UNTIL THEY ARE SCHEDULED 
TO EXPIRE. THIS UPPER LOW WILL ALSO CREATE BREEZY WESTERLY WINDS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH SOME BITTER WIND CHILL VALUES 
BELOW ZERO POSSIBLE IN THE NORTHEAST TN MOUNTAINS LATER TONIGHT. IN 
FACT...WIND CHILL VALUES MAY DROP BELOW THE ADVISORY CRITERIA OF -5 
LATE TONIGHT...BUT WILL LET DAY SHIFT DECIDE IF AN ADVISORY WILL BE 
NEEDED SINCE THESE VALUES MAY BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. 
AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME SLIGHT 
DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE TWO.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE LONG TERM 
CONTINUES TO BE POTENTIAL SIGNIFICANT WINTER SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES 
FROM THE SOUTHWEST SUNDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUES INTO MONDAY. MODELS IN 
RELATIVELY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO TIMING...BUT LESS SO WITH 
QPF WHICH IS CRUCIAL FOR DETERMINING POTENTIAL SNOW AMOUNTS. MODEL 
CONSENSUS IS THAT SOUTHERN TIER WILL RECEIVE GREATEST QPF WITH MODEL 
AVERAGE QPF IN THE 0.5 TO 0.75 INCH RANGE. WITH THE EXPECTATION THAT 
VIRTUALLY ALL OF THIS PRECIP WILL OCCUR AS SNOW...WILL ISSUE WINTER 
STORM WATCH FOR OUR SOUTHERN TIER AND SMOKY MOUNTAIN ZONES.

THIS SYSTEM WRAPS UP BY LATE MONDAY WITH WIDESPREAD SYNOPTIC SNOW 
TAPERING TO SNOW SHOWERS THROUGH MID WORK WEEK AS UPPER LEVEL LOW 
MIGRATES THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION. KEPT LATE WORK WEEK DRY AS 
WEAK UPPER RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE EASTERN CONUS. FOR TEMPS... 
TENDED TO UNDERCUT MEX GUIDANCE THROUGH MIDWEEK SINCE MOST ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS DEPICT LOWER HEIGHTS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
THAN OPERATIONAL GFS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE TEMPS BARELY BELOW
FREEZING OVER SWRN VA TO AS WARM AS LOWER 50S TODAY AT CHA...HAVE
MELTED AWAY MUCH OF WHAT SNOW HAS FALLEN...WITH RAIN OVER SE TN
INTO SRN MOST COUNTIES OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY...WHERE SMALL WARM AIR
INTRUSION HAS BEEN NOTED. COLD AIR ADVECTION KICKS IN EARLY THIS
EVENING IN THE 925 TO 850 MB LAYER...AND ANOTHER STRONG VORT MAX IS
POISED TO SWEEP SE ACROSS THE REGION OVERNIGHT. THUS...I HAVE NOT
GIVEN UP ON SOME ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL INTO SATURDAY.

OPTED TO CONTINUE OUR WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY AND WARNING AREAS AS
PREVIOUSLY DEFINED...WITH AROUND 2 INCHES OR SO CHOPPED OFF OF THE
TOTAL SNOWFALL AMOUNTS. SYNOPTIC FORCING GIVES WAY TO UPSLOPE SNOW
SHOWERS ON SATURDAY...WITH SOME MINIMAL INSTABILITY SUGGESTED...SO
A LIGHT ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATION COULD PUSH TOTALS UP TO LOWER END
OF WARNING CRITERIA IN THOSE AREAS BY 21Z SATURDAY.

OTHERWISE...MOS MINS WERE AROUND 5 TO 7 DEGREES TOO COOL LAST
NIGHT...BUT MOS DOES NOT LOOK AS FAR OFF FOR TONIGHT...ALTHO I DID
TREND A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE THE COOLER GFS MINS. CAN'T SEE TEMPS
WARMING TOO MUCH ON SATURDAY...SO I FAVORED THE COOLER GFS MAXES. 
QUITE CHILLY SATURDAY NIGHT AND A WIND CHILL ADVISORY MIGHT BE
REQUIRED FOR THE MOUNTAIN ZONES. DRY AND BEST DAY WILL BE SUNDAY 
BUT CLOUDS WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH AHEAD OF THE POTENT GULF
COAST LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SOUTHWESTERN U.S. UPPER 
LOW OPENS UP WHILE SWINGING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UPPER TROF WILL BE ON THE MOVE FROM THE WESTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO TO THE SOUTHEASTERN ATLANTIC COAST BY 00Z TUESDAY. 
RELATIVELY DEEP MOISTURE WILL BE LIFTED NORTH AND EAST OF THE LOW 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND WITH SUFFICIENTLY COLD AIR IN 
PLACE...PRECIPITATION WILL FALL AS SNOW INITIALLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA SUNDAY NIGHT AND THEN ACROSS 
THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY. PROBABILITY OF SNOW 
WILL REMAIN FAIRLY HIGH INTO TUESDAY AS ANOTHER SHORT WAVE SHIFTS 
EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION. EXACT 
SYSTEM TRACK AND AVAILABILITY TO BETTER LIFT AND DEEPER MOISTURE 
STILL IN QUESTION AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THAT SEVERAL 
INCHES OF SNOW ARE POSSIBLE...WITH HIGHER ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS DUE TO BETTER PROXIMITY TO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. SURFACE 
LOW AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE. CONTINUED WITH IDEA OF LOWER POPS WHICH 
FAVOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES ON WEDNESDAY AS LONG WAVE TROF 
STRENGTHENS ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. OROGRAPHIC COLD AIR 
ADVECTION SNOWS SHOULD WRAP UP BY THURSDAY AND RIDGING BUILDS EAST 
ALLOWING FOR (HOPEFULLY) TWO PRECIPITATION FREE DAYS TO END THE WORK 
WEEK. MEX MOS TEMPERATURES WERE WAY TOO WARM SO UNDERCUT ACROSS THE

WHILE CHA ONLY HAS A BROKEN AC DECK. THIS GENERAL TREND SHOULD
CONTINUE THROUGH ABOUT 00Z SATURDAY. AFTER THIS...CONDITIONS WILL
LIKELY DETERIORATE TO MVFR FLIGHT AT CHA AND TYS DUE TO CEILING.
TRI WILL SEE VSBY INCREASE AS THE SNOW SHOWERS BECOME LIGHTER...BUT
CEILINGS WILL REMAIN AROUND THE LOW END OF IFR FLIGHT. IT SHOULD BE
A LITTLE BETTER DAY SATURDAY BUT IT MAY TAKE SEVERAL HOURS FOR THE
LOWER CEILINGS TO MIX OUT.

918 AM EST FRI JAN 7 2011

.DISCUSSION...LIGHT PRECIPITATION (PCPN) FALLING GENERALLY ACROSS 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...IN THE FORM OF SNOW EXCEPT 
FOR EXTREME SRN AREAS. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE ENOUGH WARMING OVER 
THOSE AREAS TO KEEP A MIX WITH RAIN A POSSIBILITY...EVEN AS FAR 
NORTH AS TYS. ACTUAL 12Z SOUNDINGS FROM OHX AND RNK SUPPORT SNOW 
WITH TOP OF SATURATED COLUMN COLD ENOUGH FOR GOOD SNOW GROWTH (-15 
DEGS C OR COLDER). RUC MODEL PICKS UP ANOTHER VORT MAX TO BE 
APPROACHING FROM THE NW LATE THIS AFTERNOON...AND NAM/GFS ALSO 
INDICATE SOME HEAVIER QPF DEVELOPING INTO THE EVENING HOURS.

THUS...CURRENT ADVISORY/WARNING SCENARIO LOOKS ON TRACK. SURFACE 
TEMPS STAYING ABOVE FREEZING TODAY...PLUS A MIX WITH RAIN...WHICH 
SHOULD KEEP SNOW ACCUMULATIONS BELOW WARNING CRITERIA IN OUR 
ADVISORY AREAS. WILL KEEP SRN MOST COUNTIES OF E TN OUT OF THE 
ADVISORY FOR NOW. NOT A LOT OF SNOW REPORTS IN JUST YET...BUT LOOKS 
LIKE AROUND AN INCH OR SO OF NEW SNOW THUS FAR.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS AND THE 
SOUTHERN TN BORDER...WITH A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE MID 
MS RIVER VALLEY. AREA RADARS CURRENTLY REVEAL SOME PATCHY VERY LIGHT 
SNOW (OR FLURRIES) OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT PRECIP INTENSITY 
WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THAT THIS SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
BY LATE MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS...WITH MILD TEMPS IN THE 
40S SOUTH OF IT AND TEMPS REMAINING IN THE 30S NORTH OF IT. THUS... 
IT APPEARS THAT LIGHT SNOW WILL CHANGE TO RAIN ACROSS SOUTHEAST 
TN...WITH A SNOW/RAIN MIX OVER CENTRAL EAST TN (BUT GENERALLY SOUTH 
OF A CROSSVILLE TO KNOXVILLE TO SEVIERVILLE LINE). NAM MODEL REVEALS 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER CENTRAL EAST TN 
TODAY...WHICH COULD HELP TO ENHANCE PRECIP AMOUNTS. BUT WITH TEMPS 
POSSIBLY RISING INTO THE UPPER 30S OVER CENTRAL EAST TN DURING THE 
AFTERNOON...WILL PLAN TO KEEP THE CURRENT SNOW FORECAST OF 2 TO 5 
INCHES UNCHANGED. WITH A CHANGEOVER TO RAIN LOOKING MORE LIKELY OVER 
SOUTHEAST TN...WILL PLAN TO MENTION ONLY 1 TO 3 INCHES OF SNOW ALONG 
THE SOUTHERN END OF THE CURRENT ADVISORY. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY AND SINK SOUTHWARD 
TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA BY TONIGHT...WHICH WILL CAUSE THE SNOW 
ACTIVITY TO BECOME MORE SHOWERY (SCATTERED) AND CONCENTRATED MORE 
TOWARDS THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL TREND TOWARDS THE COOLER GFS NUMBERS WITH THE 
EXTENSIVE PRECIP AND CLOUD COVER EXPECTED.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS IN REASONABLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM. EVENT WINDS DOWN ON 
SATURDAY BUT IS FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY A SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM BY 
EARLY MONDAY. THE INTENSITY OF THIS SYSTEM IS STILL SOMEWHAT 
UNCERTAIN. MODELS AND MOST ENSEMBLE MEMBERS GENERALLY KEEP BULK OF 
MOISTURE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT THIS IS 
SYNOPTICALLY QUITE SIMILAR TO THE EVENT OF THIS PAST WEDNESDAY. 
MODELS THEN INDICATE UPPER LOW WILL MEANDER THROUGH THE LOWER GREAT 
LAKES WITH ITS PROXIMITY KEEPING THINGS POTENTIALLY UNSETTLED 
THROUGH MID WORK WEEK. TENDED TO BE A LITTLE PESSIMISTIC WITH TEMPS 
AS IT APPEARS THEY WILL REMAIN WELL BELOW CLIMO IN NEGATIVE HEIGHT 
ANOMALY REGIME.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...CLOUDS FILLING BACK IN
RATHER QUICKLY THIS AFTERNOON AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE 
(SEEN ON SATELLITE PICS ROTATING SE INTO SE MO AND SRN IL). MODELS
WERE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON SNOW DEVELOPING TOWARD MIDNIGHT AS THIS
FEATURE SWEEPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY. NAM MODEL SHOWED A
BREAK FOR EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT GFS MORE CONTINUOUS WITH LIGHT
SNOW OR SNOW SHOWERS INTO SATURDAY. SENSIBLE FORECAST IS FOR A
POTENTIAL BRIEF BREAK...THEN ANOTHER SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX SHOULD DROP
ACROSS THE REGION. OPTED TO END THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY BY
SATURDAY MORNING...AS SATURDAY LOOKS LIKE A SNOW SHOWER UPSLOPE
EVENT. THIS COULD KEEP ACCUMULATING SNOWS THROUGH SATURDAY
AFTERNOON FOR THE WARNING AREAS...SO CARRIED WARNING OUT TO 21Z
SATURDAY.

STAYED CLOSE TO OR JUST BELOW THE COOLER MAX TEMPS EACH DAY...
WITH MOS MINS CLOSE AND REASONABLE. FOR POPS...CHOSE TO GO WITH
THE HIGHEST POPS OR A LITTLE ABOVE IN THE ADVISORY AND WARNING
AREAS. WILL LET MIDNIGHT SHIFT DECIDE IF EXTREME SRN VALLEY
COUNTIES OF E TN NEED TO BE ADDED TO THE ADVISORY.

OTHERWISE...THANKS TO ALL NWS OFFICES FOR CHAT/COORDINATION...
AND TO OHX FOR BACKING US UP OVERNIGHT. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...ACTIVE FORECAST 
PERIOD WITH MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF SOUTHERN PLAINS 
SHORT WAVE TROF MAKING PROGRESS SUNDAY INTO MONDAY ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
WITH THIS SYSTEM HUGS THE GULF COAST WITH AN INVERTED TROF EXTENDING 
BACK ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. THE STAGE IS SET FOR MORE SNOW AS DEEP 
MOISTURE COMPLIMENTS OF THE PACIFIC OCEAN AND THE GULF OF MEXICO 
WILL BE LIFTED ACROSS THE FRIGID SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. THIS 
WAVE ROUNDS THE CORNER AND HEADS UP THE EAST COAST WITH THE INVERTED 
SURFACE TROF REMAINING ANCHORED BACK TO THE WEST ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. THIS SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE SEVERAL INCHES OF 
SNOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND SNOWFALL MAY CONTINUE WELL INTO 
TUESDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM FOLLOWS THE INITIAL MID LATITUDE 
CYCLONE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH MODEL DEPICTION 
OF THESE SYSTEMS DURING THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS TO BETTER RESOLVE 
QUESTIONS ABOUT SYSTEM STRENGTH...MOISTURE DEPTH AND STORM TRACK BUT 
IT APPEARS THAT THE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT PERIOD COULD 
BE RATHER SIGNIFICANT IN TERMS OF ACCUMULATING SNOW. HELD ONTO A 
NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL REGIME THROUGH WEDNESDAY WHICH FAVORS THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES AS OROGRAPHICS BECOME THE MAIN SOURCE OF 
LIFT AT THIS TIME. WAS ABLE TO KEEP THURSDAY DRY AT THIS POINT BUT 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE NOT TOO HIGH THIS FAR OUT IN THE PERIOD. TRENDED 
TEMPS A LITTLE BELOW NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE WITH PREDOMINANT NORTHWEST 
FLOW AND EXPECTED SNOW COVER.

LOW CLOUDINESS AND SNOW SHOWERS STILL IN PLACE ACROSS EASTERN
PORTIONS OF THE CWA THIS MORNING. SHOULD SEE PARTIAL CLEARING WITH
THE PRECIP ENDING BEFORE MIDDAY. TEMPS SHOULD THEN WARM UP TO JUST
BELOW SEASONAL LEVELS FOR HIGHS. WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY THROUGH 7 AM FOR THE FAR EASTERN REACHES OF THE CWA.

UPPER IMPULSE OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST WILL RACE SOUTHEASTWARD AND 
BRING A GOOD CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS TO THE AREA TONIGHT. LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE BUT IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A 
SIGNIFICANT EVENT. THE DISTURBANCE WILL USHER IN COLDER AIR FOR THE 
NEXT FEW DAYS AS LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS LINGER THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. 

IN THE EXT FCST...MODELS CONSISTENT WITH THE TRACKING OF A SFC LOW 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF. UPPER ENERGY ALSO SLATED TO GET INVOLVED 
AS A DEEP NEGATIVELY TILTED TROUGH PROVIDES ADDITIONAL SUPPORT. 
CURRENT FCST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK WITH SNOW CHANCES GENERALLY IN 
THE CHC CATEGORY. SYSTEM WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED AS THE DGEX...EURO 
AND GFS SOLUTIONS ARE ALL ON BOARD WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR A 
SIGNIFICANT WINTER WEATHER EVENT FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE EVENT IS 
STILL SEVERAL DAYS OFF SO FOR NOW...WILL JUST CONTINUE WITH THE 
CHANCES FOR SNOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...PRECIPITATION CONTINUES TO 
SPREAD EAST FROM MIDDLE TN AND NRN AL THIS AFTERNOON...IN THE FORM 
OF MAINLY LIGHT RAIN ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC...WITH SOME SLEET NOTED 
AT TYS RECENTLY. EXPECT A MIX OF RAIN...SLEET OR SNOW AS YOU WORK NE 
INTO CENTRAL VALLEY/SMOKIES...THEN MOSTLY LIGHT SNOW FOR EXTREME NE 
TN AND SW VA...BASED ON MODEL THICKNESSES AND SURFACE/LOW LEVEL 
TEMPS. 

SOME ENHANCEMENT NOTED ON IR SATELLITE PICS OVER PLATEAU...WITH THE 
RUC/GFS/ECMWF SHOWING SIMILAR QPF FOR TONIGHT...WHICH LENDS SUPPORT 
TO A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR MOST OF OUR ERN MTNS ALONG THE 
TN-NC LINE. WILL KEEP THE ADVISORY CONFINED TO THOSE AREAS...AS 
TEMPS ARE GENERALLY TOO WARM FOR MUCH IF ANY ACCUMULATION ON PLATEAU 
AND ACROSS THE VALLEY...FOR THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON. FORCING ... 
(MAINLY ISENTROPIC LIFT WITH SOME JET DYNAMICS)...IS WEAKEST ACROSS 
SW VA AND NE TN...SO I DON'T SEE THE LIKELIHOOD OF A SIGNIFICANT 
ACCUMULATION IN THOSE AREAS. ALSO...SURFACE TEMPS IN THE MID TO
UPPER 30S OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS WILL CAUSE MUCH OF THE SNOW
TO MELT INITIALLY. 

THURSDAY OFFERS A BRIEF BREAK IN THE WINTRY WEATHER...ALTHO CLOUDS 
MAY INCREASE RATHER QUICKLY IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS...AHEAD OF A 
STRONGER SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX IN THE STRENGTHENING NW FLOW ALOFT. I 
FAVORED THE COOLER MAX TEMPS THURSDAY BASED ON THESE CLOUDS. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SHORTWAVE TRACKING 
THROUGH THE REGION ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY BRINGING SNOW AND 
RAIN TO THE AREA. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  AREA 
OF LOW PRESSURE TO THE NORTH BRINGING CHANCE FOR SNOW AND RAIN FOR

TEMPERATURES MID TO UPPER 20S SOUTH AND LOWER TO MID 20S NORTH.
EXPECT INCREASING CLOUDS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH LATER THIS MORNING AND
AFTERNOON. REMOVED SNOW MENTION TODAY AS WARMER AIR WITH LIGHT
SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM INTO THE UPPER 30S

EXPECTING A FEW TENTHS OF SNOWFALL IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS BUT
POSSIBLY AN INCH OR TWO IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. LOWS TONIGHT

BEGINNING THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. LARGE SCALE LIFT DEPARTS

SHOWERS GOING IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SW VA FRIDAY NIGHT. WIND 
CHILL TEMPS MAY DROP VERY LOW FRIDAY NIGHT WITH TEMPS IN THE TEENS

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST FOR TODAY APPEARS GENERALLY ON TRACK. WEAK
UPPER WAVE CURRENTLY PASSING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION PRODUCING MID-LEVEL CLOUD DECK. HOWEVER...LATEST MODEL RUNS
CONTINUE TO PROJECT CLOUDS WILL RAPIDLY DECREASE THIS AFTERNOON IN
FAST ZONAL FLOW. TEMPS APPEAR REASONABLE BASED ON LATEST GUIDANCE
AND ASSUMPTION THAT CLOUDS WILL DISSIPATE AS EXPECTED. NO UPDATES
WARRANTED AT THIS TIME.

235 PM EST MON JAN 3 2011

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...TRANQUIL WEATHER PERSISTS 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS UPPER LEVEL FLOW REMAINS GENERALLY ZONAL 
AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ANCHORED OVER THE REGION. A WEAK 
UPPER WAVE/SURFACE COLD FRONT PASSES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION TUESDAY MORNING...BUT WEAK DYNAMICS AND LIMITED 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM SHOULD PRECLUDE ANYTHING OTHER 
THAN A BRIEF INCREASE IN MID-LEVEL CLOUDS. FOR TEMPS...MAV GUIDANCE 
APPEARS REASONABLE AND GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM THOSE 
VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A ZONAL FLOW OVER THE SOUTHEAST BECOMES A BIT MORE AMPLIFIED ON 
WEDNESDAY AS A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE AREA FROM THE 
WEST. BECAUSE OF THE ZONAL FLOW AHEAD OF THE TROUGH...MOST OF THE 
MOISTURE STAYS TO OUR SOUTH...BUT THE NAM AND THE CANADIAN PUT OUT 
SOME LIGHT QPF IN SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF OUR AREA. THE CURRENT 
FORECAST CARRIES A SLIGHT CHANCE POP WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WHICH MAY BE 
A BIT GENEROUS...BUT WILL KEEP IT GOING FOR LACK OF CONFIDENCE TO 
REMOVE IT.

A CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL SIT AND SPIN OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES 
REGION THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. A JET STREAK OVER CENTRAL CANADA 
WILL DIVE SOUTHEASTWARD AROUND THE LOW...BRINGING A SURGE OF ARCTIC 
AIR AND A CHANNELED VORT MAX OUR WAY THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS SHOULD 
BRING A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS...MAINLY TO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE 
AREA. A FAVORABLE NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN DEVELOPS ON FRIDAY WITH 
VERY COLD AIR ALOFT CREATING STEEP LAPSE RATES AND 850 MB WINDS FROM 
THE NW AT 30-40 KTS. THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH 
THIS PATTERN...HOWEVER THE OPERATIONAL GFS DOES NOT HAVE MUCH 
SUPPORT FROM GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS...SO CONFIDENCE REMAINS LOW ENOUGH 
FOR JUST CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. 

A SLIGHT WARMING TREND CAN BE EXPECTED FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY 
AS A RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA...BUT TEMPS LOOK TO REMAIN BELOW 
NORMAL EACH DAY AS THE CLOSED LOW LINGERS OFF THE CANADIAN 
MARITIMES. WHILE THE GFS AND ECMWF APPEAR VERY DIFFERENT WITH THE 
DETAILS ON MONDAY...THEY BOTH INDICATE AN AMPLIFIED FLOW ALOFT AND A 
SYSTEM AFFECTING OUR AREA ON MONDAY. WILL INTRODUCE MONDAY WITH A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE 
SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIR WEST OF THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED POST-FRONTAL 
SHOWERS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA...AS A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL PART OF THE NATION CONTINUES TO BRING SOME 
LIFT ACROSS THE REGION. MODELS AGREE THAT THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL 
CONTINUE TO TRIGGER SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT SHOWERS OVERNIGHT...SO 
WILL LEAVE AT LEAST A SMALL POP IN THE FORECAST FOR MOST AREAS 
OVERNIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE VERTICAL THERMAL 
PROFILE SHOULD REMAIN WARM ENOUGH FOR MOSTLY RAIN ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE 
THIS EVENING TO LOWER POPS AND TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME 
PATCHY FOG OVERNIGHT.

.AVIATION...COLD FRONT ALREADY MOVED THROUGH CHA AND TYS AND WILL
MOVE ACROSS TRI BY 02Z. STILL SOME -RA POSSIBLE WITH THIS FEATURE
AT TRI IN THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS. SOME MVFR CEILINGS MAY CONTINUE
FOR AN HOUR OR TWO AT CHA AND TYS WITH SOME HIGHER STRATUS BUILDING
IN FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. NOTICED THAT THE PRESSURE
GRADIENT NOT AS STRONG AS WOULD LIKE TO SEE WITH SUCH A MOIST
ENVIRONMENT FROM TODAY'S RECORD RAINFALL FOLLOWED BY GRADUALLY
DECREASING CLOUDS. LOOKS LIKE FOG MAY FORM AT THE TAF SITES IF
WINDS ARE NOT MUCH MORE THAN 3-4 KNOTS. FOR NOW APPLIED MVFR FOG
BUT IT COULD DROP INTO THE IFR CATEGORY DEPENDING ON HOW LIGHT
WINDS BECOME. SHOULD BE A BETTER DAY RETURNING ON SUNDAY AFTER
13-14Z WITH VFR FLIGHT EXPECTED.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL EXIT THE 
REGION...AND DRIER AIR WILL BEGIN MOVING IN.  LOOKS LIKE COLD AIR 
WILL NOT MOVE IN FAST ENOUGH FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT WINTRY PRECIP...AS 
PRECIP SHOULD END BEFORE MOST AREAS SEE ANY SUB FREEZING TEMPS.  
CANNOT RULE OUT SOME FREEZING DRIZZLE OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
LATE...BUT WILL NOT MENTION FOR NOW.  WINDS DIMINISHING...SO PLAN TO 
ALLOW WIND ADVISORIES/WARNINGS TO EXPIRE AT 21Z.  SHOULD SEE A 
DECREASE IN CLOUDS LATER TONIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST...WITH QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  MAV 
TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE FOR THE SHORT TERM. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...STILL ON TRACK FOR 
GENERALLY DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS TO PERSIST THROUGH THE LONG 
TERM AS UPPER FLOW REMAINS MORE OR LESS ZONAL. THE GFS AND CANADIAN 
GEM DEPICT WEAK SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE PRODUCING SOME LIGHT QPFS 
IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION EARLY THURSDAY...BUT THIS IS NOT 
SUPPORTED BY THE ECMWF AND HAS SUPPORT FROM ONLY A FEW OF THE GEFS 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. BASED ON GENERAL DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE MODELS... 
POOR RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCE AND WIDE SPREAD AMONG ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS...HAVE NOT MADE ANY CHANGES TO DRY FORECAST FOR THAT PERIOD. 
FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV/MEX 
GUIDANCE.

.AVIATION...COLD FRONT WILL EXIT THE REGION DURING THE PERIOD.
DRIER AIR WILL MOVE IN LATE TONIGHT/SUNDAY. WILL HAVE SHOWERS
AROUND EARLY IN PERIOD...WITH CIGS AND OR VIS WILL LIKELY BE MAINLY

SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW LOW CONDITIONS
WILL GO...WITH LOWER VIS/CIGS THAN MVFR POSSIBLE.
HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO INCLUDE LOWER CONDITIONS AT
THIS TIME. LOOKS LIKE LOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR THREAT HAS
DIMINISHED...ALTHOUGH MAY BE BORDERLINE MAINLY AT TYS AND TRI FOR
AN HOUR OR TWO.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST FOR REMAINDER OF TODAY GENERALLY LOOKS
REASONABLE. WILL MAKE A FEW TWEAKS MAINLY TO TEMPS AND DEW
POINTS...BUT NO MAJOR CHANGES PLANNED AT THIS TIME. HIGH WIND
WARNING AND ADVISORIES LOOK LIKE THEY WILL BE MARGINAL FOR THE
REMAINDER OF TODAY...BUT CLOSE ENOUGH THAT DO NOT BELIEVE THAT
DOWNGRADING/CANCELING IS WARRANTED...SO WILL LEAVE AS THEY ARE.
RAINFALL AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN ENOUGH TO CAUSE SOME MINOR
FLOODING/PONDING ISSUES...BUT FOR NOW DOES NOT APPEAR THERE WILL BE
ENOUGH ISSUES TO WARRANT ANY FLOOD WATCH.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG COLD FRONT DEVELOPING THIS 
MORNING. NORTH/SOUTH FRONT CURRENTLY ACROSS W TN. STRONG LOW LEVEL 
JET INCREASING IN STRENGTH IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT AND WILL PEAK 
AROUND 01/18Z ALONG THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND EAST MIDDLE 
TN. STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS BEING OBSERVED ACROSS THE HIGH ELEVATIONS 
OVERNIGHT AND WILL CONTINUE TODAY. RADAR AND SATELLITE PICS INDICATE 
SOME DOWNSLOPING OCCURRING AND EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TODAY. WENT ON 
THE HIGH SIDE OF MOS TEMP GUIDANCE ACCOUNTING FOR DOWNSLOPING. THIS 
PATTERN SHOULD ALSO KEEP PCPN AMOUNTS DOWN SOME EARLY TODAY ACROSS 
NE AREAS. THETA-E RIDGE WILL CONTINUE NORTH INTO MIDDLE TN THIS 
MORNING. LOW LEVEL FRONTOGENESIS IMPRESSIVE AS SYSTEM APPROACHES 
EARLY TODAY BUT LESSENS BY THIS AFTERNOON. PRECIPITABLE WATER WELL 
ABOVE NORMAL. SURFACE RIDGING INTO THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO 
REMAINS STRONG. THIS COUPLED WITH DEEP CONVECTION UPSTREAM OF MRX 
CWA TODAY SHOULD AID IN KEEPING FLOOD THREAT OF MRX CWA AT BAY. THE 
EXCEPTION BEING ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WHICH COULD SEE A MORE 
PROLONGED RAINFALL EVENT. THE BEST FORCING AND DEEPEST CONVECTION 
EXPECTED TO BE INTO HEART OF EAST TN AROUND MID DAY. INSTABILITY IS 
WEAK AND OTHER SEVERE PARAMETERS NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE SO SEVERE 
THREAT APPEARS SMALL BUT SOME THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE THIS MORNING 
WITH STRONG WINDS THE GREATEST THREAT. THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THIS AFTERNOON. COLD AIR ADVECTION POTENT BEHIND THE FRONT TEMPS 
WILL FALL HARD IN THE TONIGHT PERIOD. PCPN WILL MOVE QUICKLY EAST OF 
THE AREA.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WILL TRANSITION INTO A DRY 
WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE EXTENDED WITH FLOW ALOFT BECOMING ZONAL.  A 
COUPLE OF DISTURBANCES TRACKING THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW WILL MOVE AN 
OCCASIONAL BAND OF CLOUDS THROUGH.  THE FIRST OF THE DISTURBANCES 
SLIDES THROUGH ON TUESDAY...ANOTHER ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND 
POSSIBLY A THIRD ON FRIDAY.  AT THIS TIME...NONE OF THESE SYSTEMS 
LOOK STRONG ENOUGH OVER THE MRX CWA TO GENERATE ANY PRECIP.  SO FOR 
NOW...WILL LEAVE THINGS DRY THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD.
