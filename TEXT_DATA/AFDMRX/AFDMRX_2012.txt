.AVIATION...MAIN SHIELD OF PRECIPITATION STILL WELL OUT WEST ACROSS
WESTERN AND MIDDLE TENNESSEE ALTHOUGH SOME LIGHT RAIN TRYING TO
MOISTEN UP THE LOWER LAYERS AROUND TYS WHERE MVFR CONDITIONS HAVE
SET IN FOR THE LONG HAUL. LOWER LAYER WILL STEADILY MOISTEN WITH
ALL THE TAF SITES DETERIORATING TO MVFR CEILINGS/VSBY IN LIGHT RAIN
AND FOG AROUND 08Z TO 11Z AS THE STRONGER LIFT BUILDS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. POOR FLIGHT WEATHER SHOULD CONTINUE
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST WITH IFR CEILINGS DEVELOPING
AROUND 13Z TO 15Z AROUND CHA AND TYS. THE LAST SEVERAL HOURS OF THE
PERIOD MAY EVEN DROP TO LIFR AS A CEILING FORMS BELOW 600 FT.

.DISCUSSION...
MODEL SOUNDINGS CONTINUE TO SHOW VERY DRY AIR ABOUT 2KFT-2.5KFT
ABOVE THE SURFACE. THIS CORRESPONDS WELL WITH THE LATEST UPPER AIR RELEASE
FROM NASHVILLE. SOME OF THE LIGHT ECHOS WERE REACHING THE GROUND IN
SW VA AND SOME OF THAT PRECIPITATION IS SLEET. THIS TREND IS
LIKELY TO PERSIST FOR ANOTHER COUPLE OF HOURS. HOWEVER...ONCE THE
DRY AIR BECOMES MORE SATURATED WE SHOULD SEE THE FROZEN
PRECIPITATION TRANSITION TO ALL LIQUID. THERE IS STILL QUITE A BIT
OF MOISTENING THAT IS REQUIRED BEFORE THAT TAKES PLACE. THE
PRECIPITATION BAND ORIENTED FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST WILL
GRADUALLY FILL IN ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT AND BRING RAINFALL TO
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO
STEADY ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS WHILE ONLY SLIGHTLY COOLER CONDITIONS
WILL OCCUR OVER SOUTHERN AREAS. 

A GRID UPDATE WAS JUST SENT TO FRESHEN UP THE FORECAST PRODUCTS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT...BRINGING WITH IT A 
WIDE BAND OF RAIN TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  SHOULD SEE CONTINUED WARMING 
AND INCREASED MOISTURE INTO THE EVENING AHEAD OF THE FRONT WHICH 
WILL AID IN KEEPING PRECIP AS MOSTLY RAIN THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON. 
HOWEVER... HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND A FEW NORTHERN LOCATIONS MAY 
OCCASIONALLY SEE A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW TOWARDS MORNING.  ANY 
ACCUMULATION SHOULD BE LESS THAN AN INCH.  THE FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH 
OF THE AREA LATE TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT.  WITH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IN PLACE AND WEAK WEST TO EVENTUALLY NORTHWEST FLOW... 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO HAVE SCATTERED PRECIPITATION THROUGH TUESDAY 
NIGHT.  PRECIP WILL BEGIN TO EXIT THE AREA FROM NORTHEAST TO 
SOUTHEAST AND RAIN WILL CHANGE OVER TO SNOW TUESDAY NIGHT.  ANY 
ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD REMAIN LESS THAN AN INCH AND BE 
CONFINED TO THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THESE PERIODS STILL LOOK 
GENERALLY DRY WITH SEASONAL TEMPERATURES. PERHAPS STILL A VERY 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY OVER 
EXTREME EASTERN AND SOUTHERN AREAS. HOWEVER...MODELS APPEAR TO BE 
KEEPING THE BULK OF PRECIPITATION OVER THE GULF COAST STATES...AND 
TRENDING DRY FOR THE SRN APPALACHIANS. KEPT SOME CONTINUITY WITH 
PREVIOUS GRIDS AND NWS NEIGHBORS FOR NOW.

PATTERN LOOKS A BIT NOISY FOR THE WEEKEND INTO MONDAY...BUT FEATURES 
SOME WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING OVER THE NE STATES AND NEAR ZONAL 
FLOW ACROSS THE SE STATES. THIS SHOULD EQUATE TO A DRY FORECAST. DID 
NOT SEE ANY REAL OPPORTUNITIES TO IMPROVE OVER GFSX MOS...SO JUST 
MADE A FEW TWEAKS ON MAXES AND MINS IN LINE WITH SIMILAR 00Z/12Z

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A TROUGH OVER THE DESERT SW AND A STRONG SUBTROPICAL JET ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL BRING BROKEN TO OVERCAST MID TO HIGH CLOUDS 
TODAY. VERY DRY AIR BELOW 700 MB WILL PREVENT ANY PRECIP FROM 
REACHING THE GROUND BEFORE 00Z. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE INCREASING 
TONIGHT AS THE SOUTHWESTERLY 850 MB FLOW STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF THE 
PROGRESSIVE TROUGH. GRADUAL TOP-DOWN MOISTENING OF THE COLUMN SHOULD 
BEGIN TO BRING MEASURABLE PRECIP TO THE AREA AROUND MIDNIGHT. 

TEMPERATURE PROFILES IN THE NAM ARE QUITE A BIT COLDER THAN THE GFS 
AT THE ONSET OF PRECIP. SIMILAR TO THE LAST PRECIP EVENT...THE NAM 
SEEMS TO BE PUTTING GREATER WEIGHT ON EVAPORATIVE COOLING EFFECTS 
OVER WARM ADVECTION. THE GFS PROVED MORE ACCURATE IN THAT EVENT...SO 
WILL FOLLOW THE WARMER GFS FOR TONIGHT. THIS WILL MEAN NO MENTION OF 
SNOW IN THE FORECAST FOR THE MOUNTAINS. POPS WILL RISE TO 
CATEGORICAL IN THE WESTERN HALF IN THE 09-12Z TIME FRAME. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
FAIRLY STRONG FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING FOR TUESDAY WILL PRODUCE A
LARGE AREA OF RAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH CATEGORICAL POPS.
BOUNDARY WILL DRIFT SOUTHEAST FOR TUESDAY NIGHT DIMINISHING THE
CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION. THE RAIN MAY CHANGE OVER THE LIGHT SNOW
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BEFORE ENDING. THERE ARE SOME
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM RUNS THIS MORNING FOR TUESDAY
NIGHT. THE NAM SUGGESTS A WAVE WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE BOUNDARY
KEEPING HIGHER CHANCES OF RAIN OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA. WILL FOLLOW THE GFS/ECMWF SOLUTION FOR NOW...BUT
WILL WATCH TO SEE IF THIS WAVE BECOME MORE LIKELY DURING LATER
MODEL RUNS.

FOR WEDENSDAY...BOUNDARY PULLS WELL SOUTH TO THE GULF COASTS. FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...A NORTHERN STREAM WAVE MOVES TOWARD 
THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY. THIS MORNING MODEL RUNS AGREE WITH A 
MORE POSITIVE TILTED UPPER TROUGH WITH MUCH WEAKER FORCING AND 
PRESSURE FALLS. THE WEAKER SYSTEM DOES NOT PULL DEEPER BOUNDARY 
LAYER MOISTURE BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS..SO CHANCES OF 
PRECIPITATION LIMITED TO FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

FOR FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS SHOW MAJOR 
DIS-AGREEMENTS WITH UPPER PATTERN. WILL FOLLOW THE GFS FOR NOW WITH 
MORE OF A DRIER NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN.

VERY MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING AS CALM

THAT IMPACTED THE REGION AT THE END OF LAST WEEK. MOSTLY CLEAR
CONDITIONS HAVE ALLOWED FOR GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING TO OCCUR AS
TEMPS HAVE DIPPED QUITE A BIT AFTER SUNSET. HOWEVER...SOME SCT MID
TO HIGH CLOUDS ARE BEGINNING TO WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE FORECAST
AREA FROM THE WEST IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING STORM SYSTEM OVER
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THESE CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME DENSER
AFTER MIDNIGHT...PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WHICH
WILL HELP TO LIMIT COOLING A LITTLE BIT. STILL...GENERALLY SPEAKING
A VERY COLD NIGHT IS ON TAP FOR THE AREA REGARDLESS OF CLOUD
COVER AS THE MERCURY WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE UPPER TEENS TO LOW 20S
IN THE MTNS AND FOOTHILLS...AND IN THE NORTHEAST ZONES /WHERE
CLEARER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED/...TO THE MID TO UPPER 20S ACROSS

THERE SHOULD BE VERY EFFICIENT RADIATIONAL COOLING.  HOWEVER...HIGH 
CLOUDS...THEN MIDDLE CLOUDS WILL BE RACING TOWARD THE AREA...SO THE

PRECIP TIMING ETC.  LOOKS LIKE THE PRECIP WILL EITHER BE WEST OR 
NORTH OF US...OR EVEN ABOVE US AS VIRGA FALLING INTO DRIER AIR...AT 
THE END OF THE DAY...BUT READY TO MOVE IN MONDAY NIGHT.  RETURN FLOW 
SWLY WINDS WILL PICK UP MONDAY...BUT SHOULD NOT BE STRONG.

.LONG TERM  (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WITH 
A SHORT WAVE RIDING ALONG IT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA EARLY IN THE 
EXTENDED.  AS IT MOVES THROUGH...A WIDE BAND OF SHOWERS WILL PUSH IN 
MONDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO TUESDAY FOR CATEGORICAL POPS.  WARM 
AIR AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD ALLOW MUCH OF THE PREFRONTAL PRECIP 
TO BE RAIN.  ONLY EXCEPTION MAY BE A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW AT HIGHER 
ELEVATION.  A WINTERY MIX IS POSSIBLE BEHIND THE FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND WEDNESDAY...BUT MOISTURE BECOMES MORE LIMITED AND PRECIP SHOULD 
BECOME CONFINED TO GENERALLY FAR SOUTHERN AND EASTERN LOCATIONS.  
THE BOUNDARY SETTLES TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST AS ADDITIONAL WAVES TRACK 
ALONG IT.  CURRENT MODEL RUNS GENERALLY KEEP ASSOCIATED PRECIP SOUTH 
OF THE AREA THROUGH SCATTERED SHOWER ACTIVITY MAY REACH INTO MAINLY 
SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE MRX CWA THROUGH THURSDAY.  A 
COUPLE OF WEAK IMPULSES MOVES THROUGH DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE

ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL WILL END AROUND SUNRISE AS MOISTURE DEPTH

MENTIONED THROUGH THE REST OF THE MORNING IN SW VA AND NE TN 
MOUNTAINS. CURRENT OBS INDICATE THAT WINDS ON OUR SIDE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS HAVE DIMINISHED BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA...SO THE NPW

DRY ADVECTION ALOFT...CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE FROM WEST TO 
EAST THIS AFTERNOON. HIGH TEMPS WILL RANGE FROM THE MID 30S NORTH TO 
LOWER 40S SOUTH.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EXTENDED WITH
ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS MONDAY NIGHT
INTO TUESDAY INCREASING THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA.

INCREASING MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT ALONG WITH A WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT WILL PRODUCE LIKELY TO 
CATEGORICAL POPS. SOME OF THE PRECIPITATION MAY BE A MIXTURE OF 
SNOW/SLEET AND POSSIBLY FREEZING RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST AND FAR 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS.

PRECIPITATION ENDS TUESDAY NIGHT AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY PULLS SOUTH OF 
THE AREA. GFS/ECMWF ARE IN DIS-AGREEMENT IN REPECT TO NEXT NORTHERN 
STREAM WAVE WITH ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE. THE GFS HAS A STRONGER 
NORTHERN STREAM WAVE WHILE THE ECMWF IS WEAKER. BOTH MODELS SHOW 
ONLY MINOR PHASING OF THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM WAVES..SO
BRUNT OF THE MOISTURE/PRECIPITATION REMAINS EAST OF THE SPINE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. LATER SHIFTS WILL NEED 
TO WATCH FOR THE POTENTIAL OF GREATER PHASING OF THESE TWO SYSTEMS. 
IF THEY DO PHASE..THEN THE FORECAST AREA COULD SEE A DECENT SNOWFALL.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
705 PM EST SAT DEC 29 2012

.DISCUSSION...
UPDATED THE POPS/WX GRIDS TO ACCOUNT FOR AN EXPANDING FIELD OF
LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OVERSPREADING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND MUCH OF
THE GREAT TENNESSEE VALLEY. INCLUDED AT LEAST A CHANCE OF SNOW
SHOWERS AREAWIDE THIS EVENING...WITH LIKELY SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE
HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS IN THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY. ADDITIONALLY
OROGRAPHICALLY INDUCED HEAVIER NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS/BANDS
ARE CONTINUING TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EASTERN
KY/SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MTNS OF EAST TENNESSEE. AM EXPECTING THESE
SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE PLATEAU/TN VALLEY FOR
MOST OF THE EVENING AS SOME ENHANCED LIFT FROM AN UPPER-LEVEL
DISTURBANCE DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THESE SNOW
SHOWERS SHOULD NOT BE VERY HEAVY AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE
ANYTHING MORE THAN EXTREMELY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS...WITH MOST AREAS
RECEIVING NOTHING MORE THAN A DUSTING. HOWEVER...A LOCALIZED
COVERING OF GRASSY SURFACES WILL BE POSSIBLE THROUGH THE EVENING IN
A FEW SPOTS. ALSO...AS TEMPERATURES DROP OVERNIGHT...SOME PATCHY
BLACK ICE WILL BE POSSIBLE ON SOME AREA ROADWAYS THAT ARE WET FROM
THE LIGHT RAIN/SNOW THAT HAS FALLEN EARLIER.

ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE HEAVIER
SNOW SHOWERS/BANDS WILL CONTINUE TO DEVELOP THIS EVENING AND LINGER
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT. AN INCH OR TWO OF SNOW HAS
ALREADY OCCURRED IN THE HIGHER PEAKS OF THE SMOKIES AND AN
ADDITIONAL 2-3 INCHES IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT. AS A RESULT...A WINTER
WEATHER ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT THROUGH 12Z TMRW MORNING TO ACCOUNT
FOR THIS POTENTIAL. ADDITIONALLY...A WIND ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR
PORTIONS OF FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...WHERE STRONG POST FRONTAL
WIND GUSTS OF UP TO 30-40 MPH COULD CREATE HAZARDOUS TRAVEL
CONDITIONS AND COMBINE WITH THE WINTRY PRECIP TO CREATE SOME
BLOWING SNOW IN A FEW SPOTS AS WELL. BY SUNRISE TMRW...ANY SNOW
SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO TAPER OFF...BUT GIVEN THE COLD CONDITIONS
/WITH LOWS IN THE 20S AREAWIDE/...ROADS COULD STILL BE SLICK ALONG
THE HIGHER TERRAIN IN THE AFOREMENTIONED AREAS...SO CAUTION IS
URGED FOR THOSE WITH TRAVEL PLANS IN THE ADVISORY AREAS THIS
WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...COLDER AIR NOW POURING INTO THE 
AREA...WEAK DISTURBANCE IN NW FLOW MOVING INTO/ACROSS MID TN...LOOKS 
LIKE IT WILL HOLD TOGETHER WELL ENOUGH TO GET AT LEAST FLURRIES 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA THIS EVENING.  GOING ABOVE GUIDANCE ON POPS 
OVER WESTERN AND NWRN AREAS...THINKING THEY HAVE A DECENT CHANCE OF 
MEASURABLE PRECIP IN FIRST PERIOD...WHEREAS GUIDANCE WAS MOSTLY 
DRY.  THIS ENHANCED AREA OF PRECIP SHOULD MOVE ON PAST THE AREA 
SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT.  

WENT ABOUT A CATEGORY ABOVE GUIDANCE ON MIN TEMPS...AS STRATOCUMULUS 
CLOUDS SHOULD COVER MOST AREAS ALL NIGHT...AND UPSTREAM LOW TEMPS 
WERE NOT OVERLY COLD THIS MORNING IN ILL/IOWA.  ALSO...WENT ABOVE 
GUIDANCE ON DEW POINTS...AS MODELS WERE DRYING AREA OUT TOO QUICKLY.

MENTIONING BLOWING SNOW IN NE TN ZONES THAT HAVE WIND ADVISORY 
TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM  (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER THE 
REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WILL DAMPEN AND DROP SOUTHEAST LATE 
MONDAY AS THE NEXT SYSTEM AND COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA.  A FEW 
SHOWERS MAY MOVE IN IN ADVANCE OF THE SYSTEM LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON.  
HOWEVER...THE MAIN LINE OF SHOWERS WILL PUSH ACROSS THE MRX CWA 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.  EXPECT WIDESPREAD RAIN SHOWERS TO MOVE 
THROUGH FOR LIKELY POPS AND COULD SEE A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW EARLY 
TUESDAY MORNING AND MAINLY OVER NORTHERN AREAS AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. ANY LINGER PRECIP BEHIND THE FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT SHOULD 
TRANSITION TO LIGHT SNOW.  FRONT SETTLES TO OUR SOUTH ON WEDNESDAY 
WITH AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE RIDING ALONG IT WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY.  MAIN AREA OF ASSOCIATED SHOWERS WILL STAY TO OUR 
SOUTH...BUT MAY SEE SOME SHOWER ACTIVITY LIFT NORTH INTO OUR AREA.  
WILL CONTINUE WITH LOW POPS OVER MUCH OF THE AREA FOR THIS TIME 
FRAME.

LATEST MODELS IN DISAGREEMENT FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED. PREVIOUS 
GFS MODEL RUNS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT IN SHOWING A NORTHERN 
STREAM WAVE DIPPING DOWN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND PULLING A 
FAIRLY COLD SURFACE HIGH INTO THE PLAIN STATES KEEPING TEMPERATURES 
COOLER ON FRIDAY...WHILE LATEST 12Z RUN DEVELOPS RIDGING AND MUCH 
WARMER TEMPERATURES ACROSS OUR AREA. ECMWF MORE IN LINE WITH 
PREVIOUS GFS RUNS SO GOING WITH COOLER TEMPS FOR NOW. MODELS IN FAIR 
AGREEMENT ON A POTENTIAL LOW SWINGING THROUGH ON SATURDAY...BUT VARY 
ON INTENSITY AND PATH. WILL KEEP THE END OF THE EXTENDED DRY FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SYNOPTIC SCALE Q-G FORCING HAS PUSHED EAST OF THE AREA...WITH 
SHOWERY CONVECTIVE PRECIP REMAINING TO MOVE THROUGH THIS MORNING 
BENEATH COLD MIDLEVEL TEMPS WITH THE 500 MB TROUGH. OBSERVED 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MOUNTAINS AND DUAL-POL RADAR SUGGEST THAT ONLY 
THE VERY HIGHEST MOUNTAIN PEAKS MAY BE SEEING SNOW OR SLEET EARLY
THIS MORNING. HOWEVER THE FREEZING LEVEL WILL BE DROPPING OVER THE
NEXT FEW HOURS AS COLD ADVECTION INCREASES WITH THE 850-500 MB
TROUGH PASSAGE. ANY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS THIS MORNING WILL BE MAINLY
ABOVE 4000 FT. SOME TOP-DOWN DRYING WILL OCCUR LATE THIS MORNING
AND EARLY AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL LOWER POPS TO A CHANCE. MOISTURE
DEPTH INCREASES SLIGHTLY IN THE LATE AFTERNOON WITH THE APPROACH OF
A SECONDARY MIDLEVEL TROUGH AXIS. RESULTING STEEP LAPSE RATES AND
30-35 KT 850 UPSLOPE WINDS WILL PRODUCE SNOW SHOWERS WITH LIGHT
ACCUMULATIONS...MAINLY IN HIGHER TERRAIN. FOR TODAY AND
TONIGHT...UP TO 3 INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS
AND SW VA MOUNTAINS. THE CURRENT ADVISORY WILL BE CONTINUED AS IS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
FOR SUNDAY...RIDGING BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL BEGIN THE
EXTENDED FORECAST WITH DRY CONDITIONS. FOR LATE MONDAY THROUGH
TUESDAY...A NORTHERN STREAM WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAEKS WITH
A COLD FRONT DROPPING TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. AT THE SAME
TIME...A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
PLAINS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS PULLING
MOISTURE BACK INTO THE FORECAST AREA. GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN PRETTY
DECENT AGREEMENT SHOWING A VERY STRONG UPPER JET PULLING ACROSS THE
OHIO VALLEY WITH UPPER DIVERGENCE OVER THE REGION THROUGH TUESDAY
EVENING. THE UPPER JET HELPS TO PRODUCE FAIRLY STRONG FRONTO-
GENETIC FORCING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH
TUESDAY EVENING. LIKELY-CATEGORICAL POPS WILL BE INCLUDED.

MAIN CONCERN IS HOW OF A WINTRY MIX CAN BE EXPECTED ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE/NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SMOKY MOUNTAINS. 
WILL INCLUDE A WINTRY MIX FOR THESE AREAS. THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
VALLEY AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA SHOULD MAINLY BE RAIN.

ANOTHER NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE MOVES WELL NORTH AND SOUTH 
OF THE FOREACST AREA FOR LATE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. AGAIN...GFS 
AND ECMWF ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH KEEPING BRUNT OF THE 
PRECIPITATION SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. NORTHERN STREAM WAVE WILL 
PULL A FAIRLY COLD SURFACE HIGH INTO THE PLAIN STATES WITH A PIECE 
OF THE COLD AIR MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
FRIDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
VERY MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING AS SHOWERS
CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE SOUTHWEST AS AN 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TRACKS EASTWARD FROM THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. PRECIP CHANCES MAY BEGIN TO
DIMINISH LATE TONIGHT AS THERE IS SOME DRYING BACK TO THE WEST AND
SOME BREAKS WITHIN THE RAIN SHIELD ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND
CUMBERLAND MTNS ATTM. HOWEVER...AM EXPECTING AT LEAST SCATTERED
LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS TO TRACK ACROSS THE REGION FOR MOIST OF
THE NIGHT GIVEN THE A HIGH BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE/LIFT ASSOCIATED
WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT /CURRENTLY IN WESTERN
TENNESSEE/. IN FACT...A LARGE PLUME OF MOISTURE /AND ASSOCIATED
RAIN SHIELD/ LOOKS AS THOUGH IT WILL CONTINUE TO ADVANCE
NORTHEASTWARD FROM CENTRAL/EAST ALABAMA ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE AND
THE SPINE OF THE MTNS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS...YIELDING NEAR
100 POPS FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
NIGHT.

TEMPS HAVE HELD STEADY FOR THE MOST PART IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER
40S...AND ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BUDGE MUCH OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...IN
THE MTNS THEY WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW TO OCCUR...POSSIBLY UP
TO A COUPLE INCHES ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VIRGINIA AND THE
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MTNS OF EAST TENNESSEE /MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT/.
THEREFORE A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL BEGIN AT 4 AM EST IN THE
AFOREMENTIONED AREA AND ACTUALLY WILL PERSIST THROUGH 12Z SUNDAY AS
POST FRONTAL UPSLOPE FLOW WILL ALLOW SOME FOR SOME LINGERING SNOW
SHOWERS IN THESE AREAS TMRW AND TMRW NIGHT. ADDITIONALLY SOME LIGHT
ISOLATED POCKETS OF SLEET MIXING IN WITH THE RAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE
MAINLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE PLATEAU AND MTNS AS WELL...
THOUGH THE PREDOMINANT PRECIP TYPE IN MOST AREAS OVERNIGHT WILL BE
RAIN.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...LOW LEVELS HAVE REMAINED DRY 
FOR MUCH OF THE DAY ACROSS E TN LIMITING RAINFALL REACHING THE 
GROUND. WE DID RECEIVE A FEW BRIEF SLEET REPORTS FROM AROUND 
CLEVELAND TN EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON. EXPECT RAINFALL SHIELD TO 
SPREAD ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT. AFTER MIDNIGHT...THE TEMPERATURES WILL BECOME COLD ENOUGH FOR 
SOME SNOW TO DEVELOP PARTICULARLY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATION SAY 
ABOVE 3 KFT. MODEL SOUNDS HINT AT GOOD DRYING OVER CHATTANOOGA AND 
KNOXVILLE AFTER 12Z SATURDAY...SO RAIN CHANCES MAY DIMINISH GREATLY 
AFTER SUNRISE FOR THE THE SOUTHERN VALLEY EVEN WITH THE WRAP AROUND 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM.

DUE TO THE ONSET OF SNOWFALL AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS EXPECT 
ADDITIONAL SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE 
LOW LEVEL NORTHWEST UPSLOPE FLOW REGIME. WILL BE ISSUING A WINTER 
WEATHER ADVISORY FOR PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA AND PART OF THE 
SMOKIES FROM 9Z SATURDAY TO 12Z SUNDAY. THE MAIN SNOWFALL WILL OCCUR 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY EVENING. LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO 
CANCEL BEFORE 12Z SUNDAY AS CONDITIONS WARRANT.

.LONG TERM....(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPSLOPE SNOWFALL 
WILL CONTINUE SATURDAY NIGHT WITH A FEW PATCHES OF LIGHT SNOW OR 
FLURRIES LINGERING OVER FAR NORTHEASTERN LOCATIONS ON SUNDAY.  A 
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL CONTINUE THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WITH A 
TOTAL OF 1 TO 3 INCHES OF SNOWFALL POSSIBLE OVER FAVORED AREAS...THE 
HIGHEST PEAKS COULD SEE SLIGHTLY MORE ACCUMULATIONS.  HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.  MODELS DIVERGE DURING THE 
LATER HALF OF THE EXTENDED...HOWEVER...THE NEXT SYSTEM SHOULD MOVE 
IN QUICKLY AND COULD SEE CLOUDS AND POSSIBLE A FEW ADVANCE SHOWERS 
MOVE IN LATE IN THE DAY MONDAY.  THE BEST CHANCE FOR THE MAIN BAND 
OF SHOWERS WILL BE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.  THE EVENT SHOULD BE 
MAINLY RAIN WITH SOME SNOW POSSIBLE OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  MODELS 
DIFFER AS TO PLACEMENT BUT SHOULD SEE A BOUNDARY TO OUR SOUTHEAST 
WITH ASSOCIATED SHOWER ACTIVITY CONTINUING ALONG THE BOUNDARY.  WILL 
KEEP SOME LOW POPS GENERALLY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE AREA FOR 
WEDNESDAY.

FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED..A SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE ACROSS THE GULF 
COAST STATES WILL MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE CAROLINAS FOR THURSDAY. 
THURSDAY NIGHT...A NORTHERN STREAM WAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY FOR FRIDAY WITH COLDER AIR SPILLING INTO THE AREA AT THE END 
OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

THERE IS A LARGE BATCH OF PRECIPITATION OVER NORTHERN ALABAMA AND
MIDDLE TENNESSEE MOVING NORTHEAST. THIS AREA OF PRECIPITATION IS
WEAKENING AS IT MOVES INTO WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA
WHERE THERE IS SOME LIGHT RAIN MAKING IT TO THE SURFACE. HOWEVER
THE LOW LEVELS REMAIN RATHER DRY AND MODELS SUGGEST THESE LEVELS
SHOULD MOISTEN LATER THIS AFTERNOON. DUE TO THE DRYER LOW LEVELS
HAVE DELAYED THE RAIN BY AT LEAST A COUPLE OF HOURS. WE ALSO
LOWERED THE MAX TEMPS A FEW DEGREES FOR THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SW VA
AND NE TN. THE CLOUD COVER AND COOLER AIR IN PLACE WILL INHIBIT
WARMING UP TOO FAR INTO THE 40S BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON.

STAY IN THE 40S ACROSS THE AREA WITH LIMITED SUNSHINE. BY LATE 
AFTERNOON...850-700 MB POSITIVE THETA-E ADVECTION BEGINS...SPREADING 
RAIN INTO SOUTHERN AREAS. GOOD Q-G FORCING AHEAD OF THE ADVANCING 
UPPER TROUGH WILL BRING OCCASIONAL MODERATE RAINFALL TONIGHT. THE 
NAM AND GFS HAVE SOME DIFFERING TEMPERATURE PROFILES AT THE ONSET OF 
PRECIP...WHICH WILL IMPACT THE AMOUNT OF SNOW IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WARMER PROFILE OF THE GFS...WHICH HOLDS OFF 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS UNTIL THE 09-12Z TIME FRAME WHEN COLD ADVECTION 
ALOFT BEGINS. THE NAM MAY BE OVERDOING THE EFFECTS OF EVAPORATIVE

.SHORT TERM TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...CLOUDS THAT HAVE BLANKETED EAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FOR MUCH OF THE DAY WILL BEGIN 
DISSPIATING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH BEGINING LATE THIS AFTERNOON. SOME 
CLOUD CLEARING CAN BE SEEN ACROSS SOUTHERN ALABAMA OVER THE PAST 
HOUR OR SO. THIS TREND SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THE EARLY EVENING HOURS.

THIN HIGH CLOUDS WILL STREAM OVER THE AREA THE REMAINDER OF THE 
NIGHT AHEAD OF THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM. OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL 
FALL INTO THE 20S. THE SHORT-TERM FORECAST MODELS ARE ABOUT SIX 
HOURS FASTER MOVING THE RAINFALL INTO THE WESTERN PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA WHEN COMPARED TO THE RUNS 24 HOURS AGO. EXPECT RAIN TO 
BEGIN AFFECTING PORTIONS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND PERHAPS AS 
FAR EAST AS KNOXVILLE AND CHATTANOOGA AROUND NOON TIME. THE AREA OF 
RAIN SHOULD SPREAD NORTH AND EAST THROUGH FRIDAY AFTERNOON. DAYTIME 
TEMPERATURES WILL WILL GENERALLY BE IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN CONCERN THIS 
EXTENDED WILL BE A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE REGION EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD.  THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AND WILL 
BRING WIDESPREAD RAINFALL ACROSS THE AREA.  HAVE UPPED POPS TO NEAR 
100 FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.  PRECIP SHOULD BEGIN AS RAIN...AND SWITCH OVER 
TO SNOW MAINLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN AND SOME NORTHERN LOCATIONS 
OVERNIGHT.  ASSOCIATED UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO BRING IN LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE...COOLER AIR AND UPSLOPE FLOW.  SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA...FAVORING NORMAL UPSLOPE 
LOCATIONS.  THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS COULD SEE 1 TO 3 INCHES OF 
ACCUMULATIONS BY THE TIME THE SYSTEM EXITS SATURDAY NIGHT.  AN UPPER 
RIDGE BUILDS IN FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY.  MODELS DIVERGE AS THE NEXT 
SYSTEM APPROACHES THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.  CONFIDENCE 
BECOMING QUITE LOW AT THIS POINT AND WILL KEEP POPS AT CHANCE 
CATEGORY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...AND LOWER TO 20 POPS FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT.

GFS AND ECMWF NOT IN AGREEMENT ON PATTERN EVOLUTION FOR WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. ECMWF WANTS TO START BRINGING IN PRECIP ON 
WEDNESDAY FROM A CUT OFF LOW OVER TEXAS. LOW IS SLOW TO PROPAGATE 
EASTWARD BUT EVENTUALLY GETS PICKED UP BY A TROUGH SWINGING DOWN 
FROM THE NORTH ON FRIDAY EVENING INTO SATURDAY MORNING. GFS IS MUCH 
FASTER AS IT DOES NOT WANT TO CUT OFF THE LOW. GFS WASHES OUT THE 
LOW BEFORE IT EVER REACHES THE SOUTHERN U.S. BECAUSE OF THIS...GFS 
IS MUCH DRIER THROUGH THIS PERIOD. FOR NOW...GOING WITH A BLEND OF 
THE TWO BUT FAVORING GFS. CARRIED SLIGHT CHANCE OF POPS THROUGH THIS 
PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
EARLY THIS MORNING...SOME LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS STILL REMAIN
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...FAR NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE...AND THE
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAIN ZONES OF EAST TENNESSEE. RADAR
TRENDS ARE INDICATING THAT THE OVERALL INTENSITY OF THESE SHOWERS
IS WEAKENING...THOUGH THEY ARE STILL EXPECTED TO PERSIST ALONG THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH SUNRISE...AND PERHAPS MID TO LATE
MORNING. AS A RESULT...WILL KEEP THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IN SW
VIRGINIA AND THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL TENNESSEE MOUNTAIN ZONES TO
ACCOUNT FOR SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS THROUGH 12Z...BEFORE IT
TAPERS TO MORE WIDELY SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES BY
DAYBREAK. SOME BREEZY/GUSTY WINDS WILL ALSO PERSIST ALONG THE
HIGHER TERRAIN AND IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.
HOWEVER...THE OBS OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS HAVE CONTINUED TO SHOW A
DIMINISHING TREND...SO WILL ALLOW THE WIND ADVISORY TO EXPIRE AT 08Z.

FOR TOMORROW...LOW CLOUD COVER WILL GRADUALLY BEGIN TO BREAK UP
FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY. SKIES
SHOULD BECOME MOSTLY TO PARTLY SUNNY BY THE AFTERNOON OVER A GOOD
CHUNK OF THE FORECAST AREA...THOUGH CLOUDS WILL LIKELY LINGER IN
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR MOST OF THE DAY. AS
A RESULT...TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OUT OF THE MID-UPPER
30S IN THE NORTHEAST ZONES...AND DESPITE SOME HEATING ONLY THE LOW
TO MID 40S ELSEWHERE /THANKS A PERSISTENT NORTHERLY FLOW/. MAINLY
CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED LATER TONIGHT...RESULTING IN
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AND COLDER LOW TEMPERATURES IN THE 20S IN
MOST LOCATIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
A BROAD MID-UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL BE TRACKING FROM THE PLAINS TO
THE ATLANTIC COAST FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. THE SURFACE LOW WILL
TRACK WELL TO OUR SOUTH...WITH 850-700 MB MOISTURE ADVECTION AND
ISENTROPIC LIFT SPREADING NORTHWARD INTO THE TN VALLEY FRIDAY
AFTERNOON. WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS IN FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER
JET AND 500 MB VORTICITY AXIS CROSS THE AREA. TEMPS APPEAR COLD
ENOUGH FOR PRECIP TO CHANGE TO SNOW ON THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS ABOVE
4000 FT FRIDAY NIGHT. DRYING ALOFT BEGINS SATURDAY...ALONG WITH
850-500 MB COLD ADVECTION. THE PATTERN WILL TRANSITION TO A NW
FLOW...WITH MOUNTAIN AREAS BEING FAVORED FOR POP AND QPF THROUGH
SATURDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE BARELY REACHES THE DENDRITE GROWTH
ZONE...SO ANY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE LIGHT...AROUND 1 TO 2
INCHES AT BEST...AND MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FT. TOP-DOWN DRYING SHOULD
END ALL PRECIP BY 12Z SUNDAY.

SUNDAY WILL BE DRY WITH A RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE REGION. CONFIDENCE 
DROPS DRAMATICALLY FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS THE GFS AND ECMWF 
SHOW VERY DIFFERENT SCENARIOS. THE GFS MERGES SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN 
STREAM TROUGHS OVER THE OH AND MS VALLEYS...RESULTING IN PRECIP 
SPREADING OVER OUR AREA MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. IT ALSO 
PLACES OUR AREA IN THE RAIN/SNOW TRANSITION ZONE. THE ECMWF HAS A 
STRONGER NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH CROSSING NEW ENGLAND...KEEPING MORE 
RIDGING OVER OUR AREA WITH A STATIONARY CLOSED LOW OVER THE DESERT 
SW. WITH SUCH LOW CONFIDENCE...WILL MAKE FEW CHANGES TO THIS 
PERIOD...KEEPING THE LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING AND A MENTION

359 PM EST WED DEC 26 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...POWERFUL SYSTEM STILL
TRUDGING THROUGH AREA...NOW TRANSITIONING TO COLD PHASE...SW TO NE.
EXPECTED TO GET AT LEAST FLURRIES OVER MUCH OF THE AREA...WITH
MEASURABLE SNOW ACROSS MOST HIGHER TERRAIN. COULD BE MEASURABLE
OVER NORTHERN HALF OF THE VALLEY...BUT MAINLY BELOW 1 INCH OVER
VALLEY. MOISTURE ERODES VERY QUICKLY ON THURSDAY...JUST GOING WITH
FLURRIES IN HIGHER ELEVATION AND DRY ELSEWHERE. WILL KEEP CURRENT
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY GOING...WILL LEAVE OUT THE NORTHERN PLATEAU
AS AMOUNTS LOOK TOO LOW FOR THIS EVENT. MODELS LOOKED PRETTY GOOD
FOR TEMPS. WINDS WILL STAY UP FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT...WITH ADVISORY
WINDS OVERNIGHT ALONG APPALACHIAN CHAIN. WILL KEEP OTHER AREAS FOR
ADVISORY EXPIRING AT 6PM THIS EVENING.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE
FORECAST MODELS LOOK IN DECENT AGREEMENT THROUGH ABOUT SUNDAY
NIGHT. SO FOR THURSDAY NIGHT WITH SHORT WAVE RIDGING OCCURRING OVER
THE FORECAST AREA...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE NEARLY NON-
EXISTENT. THE NEXT SYSTEM...PRESENTLY OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S.
WILL BECOME A POSITIVELY TILTED TROUGH. THE AXIS OF THE TROUGH BY
FRIDAY EVENING WILL STRETCH ROUGHLY FROM MIDLAND TX TO LACROSSE WI.
AHEAD OF THE TROUGH... ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TRANSPORT WILL
OCCUR FROM LA...ACROSS MS TN AND AL. FRIDAY NIGHT SURFACE
CYCLOGENESIS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR SOMEWHERE BETWEEN NEW ORLEANS AND
JACKSON MS WHICH SHOULD ONLY HELP PRECIPITATION EFFICIENCY
PARTICULARLY ALONG THE GULF COAST. HOWEVER...SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF
THE FORECAST AREA SUCH AS CHATTANOOGA COULD RECEIVE DECENT RAINFALL
AMOUNTS THROUGH MID DAY SATURDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT. AS
THE TROUGH TRANSLATES ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY...STRONG NORTHWEST
FLOW SHOULD PROVIDE CHANCES FOR SNOW SATURDAY ESPECIALLY FOR
NORTHEASTERN AREAS SUCH AS TRI CITIES...SOUTHWEST VA AND HIGHER
MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS. THIS WILL BE SOMETHING TO WATCH IN THE COMING
DAYS.

AS MENTIONED EARLIER...AFTER SUNDAY NIGHT THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS 
DIVERGE AND BECOME VERY OUT OF SYNC. THEREFORE CONFIDENCE IN PERIODS 
AFTER SUNDAY NIGHT ARE VERY LOW. THE ECMWF FROM 00Z AND SOMEWHAT 
FROM THE 12Z RUN AND THE 00Z/12Z CANADIAN ARE SIMILAR IN CUTTING OFF 
THE LOW IN THE DESERT SOUTHWEST WHILE THE GFS IS MUCH MORE 
PROGRESSIVE. THUS THE GFS IS MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH PAINTING 
PRECIP OVER THE FORECAST AREA THAN THE OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS. 
EVEN THE ENSEMBLE GFS RUNS HAVE A TOUGH TIME COMING TO A CONSENSUS 
IN THESE LATER PERIODS. AS SUCH...MINIMAL CHANGES TO THE PREVIOUS 
FORECAST HAVE BEEN MADE.

1130 AM EST WED DEC 26 2012

.DISCUSSION...
FORECAST PRETTY WELL PLAYING OUT AS EXPECTED. SURFACE LOW NOW HAS
CONTINUED TO MOVE TO THE NORTHEAST AND IS NOW IN CENTRAL KY.
DOWNSLOPING WINDS WILL BE ENDING SW-NE AS THE WINDS SHIFT. SEVERAL
COUNTIES IN THE HIGH WINDS WARNING AREA ARE REPORTING TREES AND
LIMBS DOWN. WILL LOOK A LITTLE MORE CLOSELY FOR POSSIBILITY OF POST-
FRONTAL WIND ADVISORY IN SAME HIGH WINDS WARNING AREA. FOR
NOW...WILL LEAVE CURRENT ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS GOING.

INSTABILITY FOR THUNDERSTORMS FOR AREAS THAT HAVE NOT GOTTEN THE
COLD FRONT LOOKS VERY LIMITED. MODELS INDICATE MINIMAL ELEVATED
INSTABILITY...SO SHOWERS WILL BE COMMON...AND THERE COULD BE A
RUMBLE OF THUNDER...BUT THE INSTABILITY NEEDED FOR SEVERE STORMS IS
WELL EAST OF THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE DOWNWARD TREND
FOR MOST LOCATIONS THIS AFTERNOON AS THE COLDER AIR POURS INTO THE
REGION.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
437 AM EST WED DEC 26 2012

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
EARLY THIS MORNING...A BROAD AREA OF SHOWERS CONTINUES TO PUSH ITS
WAY NORTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE SOUTH...AS A SURFACE
LOW OVER SOUTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE LIFTS NORTHEAST. AS IT DOES
SO...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE REGION LATER
TODAY...BRINGING IT WITH SOME COOLER AIR TO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. THIS COOLER AIR WILL COMBINE WITH SOME LINGERING
MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS STORM SYSTEM TO CREATE SOME SNOW
SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING THROUGH THE
OVERNIGHT HOURS. ATTM...THE LACK OF DEEP MOISTURE...LIMITED COLD
AIR ALOFT AND A MORE PREVAILING WESTERLY FLOW WILL LIMIT THE
POTENTIAL FOR THIS TO BE A TRUE NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL EVENT.
HOWEVER...HIGHER ELEVATION LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
EAST TENNESSEE...PARTICULARLY THE HIGH MOUNTAIN PEAKS WILL LIKELY
EXPERIENCE SOME ACCUMULATIONS 1-4 INCHES...WITH SOME LOCALLY HIGHER
AMOUNTS POSSIBLE IN THE SMOKIES GIVEN THE LONGER DURATION OF COLD
AIR AND ENHANCED ORTHOGRAPHIC LIFT. GIVEN THIS...HAVE OPTED TO
ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THE AFOREMENTIONED AREAS FROM
23Z THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH 12Z THURSDAY MORNING WHEN THE SNOWFALL
POTENTIAL APPEARS GREATEST.

THE OTHER THREAT OF NOTE WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM WILL BE THE
POTENTIAL FOR SOME STRONG GRADIENT WINDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
TODAY AS A STRONG 60-70 KT LOW-LEVEL JET PASSES OVER EAST
TENNESSEE. THE POTENTIAL FOR VERY GUSTY/STRONG WINDS WILL EXIST
ALONG THE FOOTHILLS AND HIGHER MOUNTAIN TERRAIN AND THUS A HIGH
WIND WARNING IS IN EFFECT FOR THE FAVORED AREAS THROUGH THIS
AFTERNOON. ADDITIONALLY...WIND ADVISORIES FOR THE PLATEAU AND
MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ARE IN EFFECT THROUGH THIS
AFTERNOON AS WELL. SOME GUSTY NEAR ADVISORY-LEVEL WINDS WILL LIKELY
PERSIST ALONG THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS LATER TONIGHT...BUT
GIVEN THEIR WESTERLY COMPONENT THE HIGHER WIND SPEEDS WILL BE ON
THE LEE SIDE IN WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA...WITH VALUES IN THE VALLEYS
BEING MUCH LIGHTER AS WELL. THUS...HELD OFF ON EXTENDING ANY WIND
ADVISORY PRODUCTS FOR TONIGHT FOR NOW.


.LONG TERM /THU NIGHT THROUGH TUE/...
WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL PROVIDE A
DRY THU NIGHT INTO AT LEAST THE FIRST PART OF FRIDAY. MODELS
CONTINUE TO BE IN DECENT AGREEMENT THAT THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL
APPROACH BY FRIDAY NIGHT. MODEL AGREEMENT AND RUN TO RUN
CONSISTENCY STILL LACKING FOR THE DETAILS HOWEVER. TREND OF THE
MODELS HAS BEEN TO SPEED THINGS UP...SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS SOUTHWEST ZONES LATE FRIDAY...THEN CAT TO LIKELY POPS FOR
FRIDAY NIGHT. CHANCE SOUTHWEST TO LIKELY NORTHEAST SATURDAY. PRECIP
TYPE STILL LOOKS TO BE PRIMARILY RAIN IN THE SOUTHERN/CENTRAL AREAS
UNTIL A SWITCH TO SNOW SHOWERS ON THE BACKSIDE. PRECIP TYPE STILL
MORE UNCERTAIN NORTH. MAY BE A LINGERING SNOW SHOWER EARLY NORTHERN
AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS SUNDAY BUT OTHERWISE DRY...WITH DRY WEATHER
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE INTO MONDAY. ANOTHER SYSTEM FORECAST TO
APPROACH BY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...SO WILL CARRY CHANCE

OF PRECIP APPEARS TO BE A BIT FASTER THAN THE NAM...BUT IN LINE
WITH THE CURRENT FORECAST. NO UPDATE WILL BE NEEDED. THE LLJ WILL

ADVISORY AND HIGH WIND WARNING WILL NOT BE CHANGED. THE THREAT OF
SEVERE WEATHER APPEARS TO BE DIMINISHING AS THE SURFACE WARM FRONT
REMAINS WELL TO OUR SOUTH ACROSS CENTRAL AL AND SRN GA. WITH THE

235 PM EST TUE DEC 25 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...VERY DYNAMIC 
SYSTEM DEVELOPING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS/GULF COAST STATES THIS 
AFTERNOON WITH STRONG CONVECTION ACROSS LA. NORTHERN STREAM JET OVER 
THE OHIO VALLEY AND STRONG SOUTHERN STREAM JET ACROSS TX WILL 
PRODUCE DEEP AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL LIFT OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
LATER TONIGHT AND RAPID CYCLOGENESIS. SURFACE LOW OVER LA WILL LIFT 
NORTHEAST TOWARD THE PLATEAU THIS EVENING WITH A WARM FRONT LIFT 
NORTH ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF COAST STATES. 

STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE WARM FRONT WILL PULL AN AREA OF RAIN 
INTO THE FORECAST LATER THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING. THE WARM FRONT WILL 
PULL NORTH TO JUST ABOUT CHA BEFORE OCCLUDING AS SURFACE LOW RIDES 
NORTH. INSTABILITY WILL INCREASE WITH CAPES AROUND 500 J/KG INTO THE 
PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. THE CONVECTION WILL TAP INTO THE 
VERY STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET TO PRODUCE A CHANCE OF DAMAGING CONVECTIVE 
WINDS GENERALLY SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40 BETWEEN 05-13Z. 

THE STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET WITH 850MB WINDS OF 65-70KTS ALONG WITH 
FAVORABLE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL SET THE STAGE FOR 
DAMAGING MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WINDS. HIGH WIND WARNING IS IN EFFECT 
FOR THE FAVORED AREAS TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. HAVE ALSO INCLUDED WIND 
ADVISORIES FOR THE PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS 
WELL.

AS SURFACE LOW MOVES NORTH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY AND SECONDARY LOW 
FORMS ACROSS THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES..COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL CHANGE 
THE RAIN TO SNOW..ESPECIALLY FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN. SNOWFALL OF 1 
TO 3 INCHES ANTICIPATED FOR THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA..EASTERN
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS..AND AROUND 1 INCH FOR THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. 
MOST OF THE ACCMULATING SNOWS WILL OCCUR LATE WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUE)...MAY BE A FEW LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS 
INTO THU MORNING OVER THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL MOUNTAINS...BUT THE 
WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND UPPER RIDGING SHOULD PROVIDE A DRY 
AFTERNOON THU WITH DRY WEATHER CONTINUING THROUGH FRIDAY.  MODELS IN 
DECENT AGREEMENT THAT ANOTHER SYSTEM WILL BE AFFECTING THE AREA THIS 
WEEKEND...BUT DIFFER IN THE DETAILS AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IS 
LACKING AS WELL.  00Z ECMWF SHOWS A STRONGER SOUTHERN SYSTEM...WHILE 
THE 12Z GFS SHOWS MORE LOW PRESSURE FARTHER NORTH.  A SOLUTION MORE 
LIKE THE ECMWF WOULD LEAD TO MORE OF A WINTRY MIX THAN THE WARMER 
GFS.  GIVEN MODEL AND ENSEMBLE SPREAD WILL MENTION A WINTRY MIX 
MAINLY NORTH BUT WILL LEAN TOWARD MORE RAIN OVERALL.  SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS CAN BE EXPECTED ON THE BACK SIDE SAT NIGHT AND POSSIBLY INTO 
SUNDAY.  HIGH PRESSURE EXPECTED TO BRING DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO MONDAY.  

ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHES THE REGION LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. 
MODELS SHOW A LOT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE TIMING...SO KEPT POPS LOW.

413 AM EST TUE DEC 25 2012

.SHORT TERM...(CHRISTMAS DAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LOTS OF WEATHER
OCCURRING BOTH THIS MORNING AND FROM LATE TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. 
DENSE FOG AND DRIZZLE THE PROBLEM THROUGH MID MORNING...WITH MOST
OF THE AREA EXPERIENCING LESS THAN 1/2 MILE VISBYS. THUS...EXTENDED
THE DENSE FOG ADVISORY THROUGH 10 AM EST TODAY. FOG SHOULD LIFT
WITH SOME BRIEF IMPROVEMENT BEFORE MID AND HIGH CLOUDS OVERSPREAD
THE REGION AS THE INTENSE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE STRENGTHENS OVER THE
LOWER MS VALLEY REGION THIS AFTERNOON. WITH ONLY THE SREF SPREADING
ANY RAIN TO SW VA AND NE TN THIS AFTERNOON...I KEPT THOSE AREAS AT
LESS THAN 20 PERCENT POPS FOR NOW.

FOR TONIGHT...MAIN STORY REMAINS THE HIGH WINDS FOR THE EASTERN
MTNS AND FOOTHILLS...WITH HIGH WIND WATCH CONTINUED FOR NOW. THERE
IS ALSO A THREAT OF A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS LATE TONIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY MORNING...AT LEAST FOR SE TN AND SW NC AS THE WARM FRONT
LIFTS NORTH INTO THOSE AREAS. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED RIGHT
ON TRACK WITH VERY LITTLE CHANGES MADE...WITH A LITTLE DOWNSLOPING
QUITE POSSIBLE DUE TO THE STRONG SE WINDS THAT DEVELOP.

FOR WEDNESDAY...TEMPS SHOULD PEAK EARLY THEN DROP IN THE AFTERNOON
BUT I DID BUMP UP THE AFTERNOON TEMPS JUST A BIT...EXCEPT FOR OUR
NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES WHERE COLD AIR ADVECTION ARRIVES SOONEST. HIGH
WIND THREAT IS GREATLY DIMINISHED AFTER 18Z...BUT SPEEDS MAY STILL
WARRANT A WIND ADVISORY IN SEVERAL AREAS. WILL LET DAY SHIFT TODAY
ADDRESS THIS ISSUE. NOT LIKELY TO SEE MUCH SNOW ACCUMULATIONS
THROUGH WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...EVEN ACROSS NRN PLATEAU AND HIGHER
TERRAIN OR MTN AREAS. 


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
IN WAKE OF A COLD FRONT DROPPING THOUGH THE FORECAST AREA...SOME 
COLD AIR WILL CONTINUE TO FILTER INTO THE REGION AND COMBINE WITH 
THE SOME LINGERING WRAP AROUND MOISTURE TO CREATE SNOW SHOWERS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING. GIVEN THE LACK OF DEEP 
MOISTURE/COLD AIR AND A PREVAILING WEST TO WNW COMPONENT TO THE 
WIND...THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A CLASSIC NORTHWEST SNOWFALL 
CASE. MOST VALLEY AND LOWER ELEVATION AREAS WILL EXPERIENCE LIGHT 
SNOW SHOWERS...WITH VERY NO MINOR TO NO ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED. 
HOWEVER...HIGHER ELEVATION LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
EAST TENNESSEE...PARTICULARLY THE HIGH MOUNTAIN PEAKS WILL LIKELY 
EXPERIENCE SOME ACCUMULATIONS OF AN INCH OR TWO GIVEN THE LONGER 
DURATION OF COLD AIR AND ENHANCED OROGRAPHIC LIFT. WITH THE JET 
PULLING NORTHEAST OF THE AREA BY 00Z THURSDAY...THE THREAT OF HIGH 
WINDS WILL LIKELY CEASE HEADING INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER... 
GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THIS STORM SYSTEM AND THE TIGHT PRESSURE 
GRADIENT...SOME PERSISTENT ROBUST GRADIENT WINDS IN WAKE WILL CREATE 
SOME DIFFICULT TRAVEL CONDITIONS IN THE FOOTHILLS AND HIGHER TERRAIN 
AND LIKELY REQUIRE A WIND ADVISORY THROUGH 12Z THURSDAY. 

BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING...ANY LINGERING PRECIPITATION IN THE 
MOUNTAINS WILL DISSIPATE...RESULTING IN DRY CONDITIONS THROUGH 
FRIDAY. HOWEVER...ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH IS PROGGED TO SWING THROUGH 
THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THIS WEEKEND...GIVING THE REGION 
ANOTHER SHOT OF PRECIPITATION /POTENTIALLY SOME WINTERY PRECIP... 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN/MOUNTAIN ZONES SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY MORNING/. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE MODEL UNCERTAINTY THIS FAR OUT 
WILL NOT GET TOO SPECIFIC WITH THE EXACT DETAILS YET. STILL...FELT 
CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO LIKELY TO HIGH-END CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE ON 
SATURDAY...WITH CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY BEFORE THINGS DRY OUT TO 
CLOSE OUT THE YEAR 2012 ON MONDAY.

LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE..WET GROUND..LIGHT WINDS AND DIMINISHING MID AND
UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS WILL ALLOW AREAS OF DENSE FOG TO DEVELOP
OVERNIGHT. HAVE ISSUED A DENSE FOG ADVISORY AREA-WIDE THROUGH 13Z.

AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WITH A DEEP UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE
PLAINS STATES WILL LIFT NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY WEDNESDAY. STRONG
DYNAMICS AS A DOUBLE JET STRUCTURE PRODUCES IMPRESSIVE LIFT OVER
THE AREA FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING. AGEOSTROPHIC
CIRCULATIONS AROUND NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAMS JETS WILL ENHANCE
FRONTO- GENETIC FORCING FOR LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY
MORNING. ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO INCLUDE THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. DUE TO THE STRONG BOUNDARY
LAYER JET (850MB WINDS 60-70KTS)..LOCALIZED CONVECTIVE DAMAGING
WINDS ARE POSSIBLE.

DUE THE STRONG 850MB JET AND FAIRLY FAVORABLE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE 
PROFIE...MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WINDS ARE A REAL CONCERN FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS FROM EAST TENNESSEE TO SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. HAVE ISSUED A HIGH WIND
WATCH FOR THESE AREAS.

FOR WEDNESDAY...STRONG COLD FRONT PASSES QUICKLY ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH ENOUGH WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE TO ALLOW THE RAIN TO CHANGE TO 
SNOW AREA-WIDE. 

.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH MON)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
EARLY ON WITH FAIRLY TYPICAL INCREASING SPREAD LATER ON.  FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.  WITH COLD AIR 
PUSHING IN AND SOME MOISTURE WRAPPING AROUND DEPARTING SYSTEM WED 
NIGHT SHOULD SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS.  RIGHT NOW DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A 
FAVORABLE NORTHWEST UPSLOPE SNOW EVENT...AS FLOW WILL BE MORE 
WESTERLY...COLD AIR NOT OVERLY DEEP AND MOISTURE BECOMES SHALLOW 
FAIRLY QUICKLY. STILL MAY BE SOME AT LEAST MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
ESPECIALLY HIGHER TERRAIN WED NIGHT INTO EARLY THU SO WILL CONTINUE 
MENTION IN HWO.  SHOULD BE DRY THU NIGHT AND FRIDAY AS WEAK SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE TAKES CONTROL.  NEXT SYSTEM FORECAST TO BRING PRECIP 
TO THE AREA THIS WEEKEND.  AT THIS POINT THIS LOOKS LIKE MUCH OF 
THIS WILL BE A RAIN EVENT...BUT CANNOT RULE OUT SOME FREEZING/FROZEN 
PRECIP AT THE ONSET MAINLY NORTH. ALSO LOOKS QUITE LIKELY THAT WE

CHANCES CLIMB TO CATEGORICAL AFTER 23/06Z MONDAY. PERSISTENT 
ISENTROPIC LIFT WITH DEEP AND MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW OVER THE AREA 
MOST OF THE DAY AS SURFACE LOW PRESSURE MOVES NE ACROSS W TN INTO

AIR ADVECTION IN ADVANCE OF THE SHORTWAVE. LEANED TOWARD WARMER NAM 
TEMP MOS TONIGHT AND USED BLEND FOR MONDAY. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...VERY ACTIVE EXTENDED 
FORECAST. FOR MONDAY NIGHT...WEAK FRONT MOVES EAST OF THE AREA WITH 
A GOOD DEAL OF LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINING ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. WILL INCLUDE AREAS OF FOG AND DRIZZLE. SOME OF THE FOG COULD 
BE DENSE.

THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. DUE TO

DUE THE STRONG 850MB JET AND FAIRLY FAVORABLE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE 
PROFILE...MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WINDS ARE A REAL CONCERN FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS FROM EAST TENNESSEE TO SOUTHWEST

WARNING MAY BE NEEDED.

FOR WEDNESDAY...STRONG COLD FRONT PASSES QUICKLY ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH ENOUGH WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE TO ALLOW THE RAIN TO CHANGE TO 
SNOW AREA-WIDE. A LIGHT SNOWFALL POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. FLOW IS MORE 
WESTERLY...SO DO NOT EXPECT A MAJOR NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL EVENT.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. RELATIVELY DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE
RAPIDLY MODIFIES LATER TODAY AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT. PWAT VALUES 
RISE TO .75 TO .90 TONIGHT. GOOD LIFT IN THE H85-H70 LAYER. THIS 
MOISTENING WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY MODEST WARM UP. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM....SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...FAST MOVING AND 
RATHER WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION LATE TONIGHT AND 
EARLY MONDAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON CLOUDS INCREASING 
TODAY...THEN RAIN CHANCES CLIMB TO CATEGORICAL AFTER 06Z MONDAY. 
THIS SHAPES UP TO BE AN ALL RAIN EVENT GIVEN THE WARM AIR ADVECTION 
IN ADVANCE OF THE SHORTWAVE. PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED 
RIGHT ON TRACK WITH JUST A FEW ADJUSTMENTS. SHORT RANGE MODELS 
INCLUDING THE SREF WANT TO ZIP THE RAIN EAST OF THE REGION LATE 
MONDAY AFTERNOON...SO POPS WERE LOWERED FROM THE WEST A BIT FASTER.

OTHERWISE...STUCK CLOSE TO GFS MOS TEMPS FOR TODAY...AND FAVORED 
MORE OF A MOS BLEND FOR TONIGHT AND MONDAY. NAM WINDS BETTER CHOICE 
BUT WERE DECREASED SOME IN LIGHT OF THE WEAKER TEMP/PRESSURE DIFFS 
WITH THIS SYSTEM. 

LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WITH PASSAGE OF FIRST 
SYSTEM MONDAY EVENING RAIN WILL COME TO AN END. THERE WILL BE A 
BRIEF BREAK MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY. AIR MASS DRIES OUT WITH 
ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTH AND EASTERN AREAS. MOISTURE 
SURGES BACK NORTH TUESDAY AS ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE AREA DEVELOPS OVER 
TEXAS ALONG COLD FRONT. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW LOW PRESSURE 
DEEPENING RAPIDLY TUESDAY OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY BRINGING RAIN 
BACK INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 850 MB WINDS INCREASE TO ABOUT 55 TO 60 
KNOTS TUESDAY NIGHT WITH A MOUNTAIN WAVE LIKE PATTERN. A WIND 
ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS MAY DEVELOP BUT 
MORE LIKELY TO THE SOUTH IN AL OR GA SO NOT INCLUDING THEM IN THE 
FORECAST YET. DEEPENING SURFACE LOW IS EXPECTED TO TRACK NE THROUGH 
TN AND THEN NE INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY THURSDAY MORNING. 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE ON THE WARM SIDE OF THE SYSTEM 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH A COLD RAIN THE EXPECTED PRECIPITATION. LATER 
WEDNESDAY COLD AIR WRAPPING AROUND THE LOW WILL CAUSE A CHANGE OVER 
TO SNOW. MEASURABLE SNOW LOOKS POSSIBLE ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA BUT AMOUNTS LOOK TO BE ONLY ABOUT ONE INCH OR TWO POSSIBLY 
HIGHER IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MUCH COLDER WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. ANOTHER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...CLEAR AND COOL TONIGHT AS SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE AREA SLIDES SE ON SUNDAY. WEAK SW LOW 
LEVEL FLOW COMMENCES SUNDAY. AN WEAK UPPER SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE 
INTO THE AREA SUNDAY AFTERNOON. INCREASING AND LOWER CLOUDS THROUGH 
THE DAY. GOOD ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MOISTURE RETURN WILL BRING IN SOME 
LIGHT RAIN FROM THE SW LATE. COOL TEMPS TONIGHT WARMING UP TO ABOVE 
NORMAL SUNDAY.  

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...FIRST SHORT-WAVE 
TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO SOUTHERN PLAINS SUNDAY NIGHT WITH CYCLOGENESIS 
DEVELOPING OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. ISENTROPIC LIFT 
WILL HELP SPREAD AN AREA OF RAIN INTO THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY EVENING. FRONTAL PASSAGE MONDAY EVENING WILL PULL 
RAIN EAST OF THE AREA...BUT PLENTY OF BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE WILL 
REMAIN PRODUCING FOGGY CONDITIONS AND AREAS OF DRIZZLE. 

A MUCH STRONGER UPPER TROUGH WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY THEN PULL TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR 
TUESDAY. NORTHERN STREAM JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY COMBINED WITH A 
STRONG SOUTHERN STREAM JET ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES WILL COMBINE 
TOO PRODUCE A DOUBLE JET STRUCTURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT. THE AGEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION AROUND THE RIGHT 
ENTRANCE AND LEFT EXIT REGION WILL STRENGTHEN THE FRONTO-GENETIC 
FORCING WITH FROPA ANTICIPATED BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. STRONG COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WEDNESDAY WILL QUICKLY CHANGE THE RAIN TO SNOW OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA.

FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...WRAP-AROUND 
MOISTURE AND NORTHWEST BOUNDARY FLOW WILL PRODUCE GOOD OROGRAPHIC 
LIFT. NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALLS ARE ANTICIPATED WITH SIGNIFICANT 
MOUNTAIN SNOWS POSSIBLE FOR THE NORTHERN-CENTRAL EASTERN TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. ELSEWHERE...A LIGHT SNOWFALL IS 
POSSIBLE WHICH MAY CAUSE SOME TRAVEL CONCERNS...GENERALLY NORTH AND 
CENTRAL FORECAST AREA. 

BESIDES THE RAIN/SNOW CONCERNS...FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...A 60-65KT 
BOUNDARY LAYER JET WILL PRODUCE HIGH WINDS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS. 
AREA FORECAST SOUNDINGS DO NOT SHOW A GOOD VERTICAL PROFILE FOR 
MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WINDS FOR THE FOOTHILLS...BUT A MARGINAL HIGH 
WIND WARNING EVENT IS POSSIBLE.

FOR FRIDAY...FORECAST AREA WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS WITH DRY 
CONDITIONS. 

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE EAST 
OUT OF THE CENTRAL-SOUTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE AREA. THIS NORTHERN 
STREAM WAVE WILL PULL A CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW FOR SATURDAY.

BRISK AT TRI AS PRESSURE GRADIENT IS STILL RATHER TIGHT ACROSS NORTHEAST
TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. ALL SITES EXPECTED TO STAY VFR. HOWEVER...TRI
COULD BRIEFLY DROP TO NEAR MVFR CONDITIONS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS
BUT DID NOT FEEL CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IN TAFS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
243 PM EST FRI DEC 21 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE
ACROSS NE TN AND SW VIRGINIA THIS EVENING. BRISK WEST TO NORTHWEST 
WINDS WILL WEAKEN THIS EVENING. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE 
TO MOVE NORTHEAST THROUGH THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES INTO SE CANADA 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. HIGH PRESSURE AND A DRIER AIRMASS WILL BUILD 
INTO THE REGION FROM THE WEST. TEMPERATURE ADVECTION BECOME NEUTRAL 
TONIGHT AND IS WEAKLY WARM ON SATURDAY. TONIGHT MINS WILL BE RANGE 
FROM THE TEENS TO THE LOW 20S ACROSS MOST AREAS WITH COLDER READINGS 
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SATURDAY WITH SUNNY SKIES TEMPERATURES 
WILL APPROACH NORMAL LATE. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...ACTIVE EXTENDED 
FORECAST. SURFACE RIDGING SATURDAY NIGHT WILL MOVE EAST ALLOWING A 
PLUME OF GULF MOISTURE TO PULL NORTHEAST TOWARD THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY. A FAST MOVING SOUTHERN 
STREAM WAVE WILL PRODUCE WEAK CYCLONGENESIS OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT WITH A FRONTAL PASSAGE LATE MONDAY. ISENTROPIC 
LIFT AND FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING WILL FOCUS THE GULF MOISTURE TO 
PRODUCE AN AREA OF GENERALLY LIGHT RAIN. 

THIS BOUNDARY WILL MOVE SOUTH OF THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT...BUT A 
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM WAVES WILL PHASE OVER THE PLAIN STATES 
TUESDAY THEN MOVE EAST/NORTHEAST ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THE GFS/ECMWF 
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT IN TRACKING THE SURFACE LOW ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. A DOUBLE JET STRUCTURE OF THE NORTHERN AND 
SOUTHERN STREAM JETS WILL PRODUCE STRONG LIFT OVER THE AREA 
ENHANCING FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING. LATEST RUN SHOWS A MORE 
PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM WHICH WILL LIMIT FLOODING POTENTIAL. 

HOWEVER...AS THE SURFACE LOW MOVES NORTHEAST...COLD AIR WILL SPILL 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY CHANGING PRECIPITATION TO SNOW. 
SNOWFALL IS POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. STRONG NORTHWEST WINDS WILL 
CONTINUE TODAY. ANOTHER IMPULSE OF SLIGHTLY DEEPER MOISTURE WILL 
BRING ADDITIONAL SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS...MAINLY ACROSS 
NORTHERN AREAS. TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE LITTLE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD AIR FLOWING INTO THE REGION 
THIS MORNING...BRINGING WINDY CONDITIONS AND SNOW FLURRIES ACROSS SW 
VA AND THE NE HALF OF E TN. LAPSE RATES ARE QUITE STEEP THIS MORNING 
ALREADY AND PROGGED TO STEEPEN EVEN MORE THIS AFTERNOON. W-NW LOW 
LEVEL WINDS SHOULD PROVIDE UPSLOPE COMPONENT TO COMBINE WITH STRONG 
COLD AIR ADVECTION. BOTH GFS AND NAM MODELS SHOW SUFFICIENT MOISTURE 
INTO THE AFTERNOON FOR A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION OVER THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF SW VA AND NE TN. THUS...A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WAS 
INTRODUCED FROM FORECAST ISSUANCE THROUGH 7 PM EST (SAME ENDING TIME 
AS OUR WIND ADVISORY FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA).

STAYED TRUER TO PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID AND UNDERCUT THE GFS MOS 
HIGHS WHICH WERE SIMILAR TO NAM MOS. WINDS SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH 
THIS EVENING...SO I DID NOT EXTEND THE WIND ADVISORY FOR NOW...NOR 
DID I KEEP ANY MENTION OF SNOW OR FLURRIES AFTER THIS EVENING. 
TRENDED QUITE CLOSE TO THE COLDER GFS MOS ON MINS TONIGHT.

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AFTER COLD NIGHT GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND BEGINS SATURDAY AS COLD UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS EAST AND 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING MOVES EAST FROM THE CENTRAL STATES. HIGHS ABOUT 
5 DEGREES WARMER. WINDS STILL STRONG ESPECIALLY SW VA AND NE TN 
MOUNTAINS AS LARGE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN STACKED UPPER LOW OVER 
NE AND GULF COAST HIGH CONTINUES. SURFACE HIGH BEGINS TO SHIFT TO 
THE SE US COAST SATURDAY NIGHT. LOWS WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER SUNDAY 
MORNING. SUNDAY MOISTURE BEGINS TO INCREASE AS NEW LOW PRESSURE AREA 
DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. WARM FRONT DEVELOPS AHEAD OF

POSSIBLY EARLY MONDAY BEFORE WARM AIR OVERTAKES THE REGION. COLD 
FRONT TO APPROACH MONDAY NIGHT OR EARLY TUESDAY WITH WARMER 
TEMPERATURES AND MORE RAIN. TUESDAY EVENING NEXT SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM 
TO DEVELOP OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY ALONG TUESDAYS FRONT. MODELS 
RAPIDLY INTENSIFY THIS SYSTEM AS IT MOVES FROM THE TN VALLEY TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO THE MID ATLANTIC EARLY THURSDAY. STRONG WINDS DEVELOP 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA AND COLD AIR ON THE BACK SIDE WILL CAUSE RAIN 
TO CHANGE TO SNOW WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY. A COUPLE 
INCHES OF SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND NE TN LOOKS 
POSSIBLE. ALSO MUCH COLDER THURSDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE 30S AND COLDER 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE NE.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE 
EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A COLDER AIR 
MASS MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. A STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD GENERATE STRONG WINDS 
THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT...SO WILL CONTINUE THE WIND ADVISORY WITH NO 
CHANGES. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILE CONDUCIVE 
FOR SNOW DEVELOPMENT TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...BUT THE 850 MB WINDS ARE 
PROGGED TO REMAIN MORE WESTERLY THAN NORTHWESTERLY TONIGHT AND 
FRIDAY MORNING. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT UPSLOPE FLOW SHOULD BE 
MINIMAL AND MAY NOT BE ENOUGH TO GENERATE ADVISORY-LEVEL SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS. THUS...WILL HOLD OFF ON ISSUING ANY WINTER WX 
ADVISORIES FOR SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS THIS EVENING...AND 
WILL LET MIDNIGHT SHIFT RE-EVALUATE. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF UP TO TWO INCHES OF SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS BY FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON...BUT MAINLY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST LATER THIS EVENING MAINLY

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
252 PM EST THU DEC 20 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...STRONG SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE NE INTO MI TONIGHT AND ENE THROUGH THE E 
GREAT LAKES ON FRIDAY. COLD FRONT BOWING THROUGH THE E TN VALLEY 
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. PREFRONTAL 
DOWNSLOPING WINDS WILL END AS WINDS SHIFT SW BEHIND THE FRONT. AREAS 
OF PRECIPITATION WILL TAPER OFF BEHIND THE FRONT. WINDS WILL SHIFT 
TO THE NW THIS EVENING AND REMAIN BREEZY AND BECOME STRONG OF 
FRIDAY. NEAR POST FRONTAL RELATIVE HUMIDITY REMAINS SHALLOW WHILE 
COLD AIR ADVECTION IS STRONG. LIGHT SHOWERS AND DRIZZLE WILL CONTINUE 
IN CYCLONIC FLOW ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF MRX CWA. 
FREEZING LEVEL FALLS HARD AFTER 21/00Z. THE LIGHT PRECIPITATION WILL 
LIKELY SHIFT BRIEFLY TO FREEZING DRIZZLE AS DEPTH OF RH DOES NOT 
EXTEND INTO THE SNOW GROWTH REGION. WRAP AROUND MOISTURE MOVES INTO 
THE AREA AFTER 21/06Z WITH HIGHER RH EXTENDING UP INTO THE SNOW 
GROWTH REGION CONTINUING INTO MID DAY FRI. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SOME 
LIGHT SNOWFALL ACROSS NE TN/SW VA. TEMPERATURES WILL FALL INTO THE 
20S TONIGHT. STRONG NORTHWEST WINDS WILL KEEP WIND CHILL VALUES 
BELOW FREEZING FRIDAY. A WIND ADVISORY WILL BE REQUIRED AREAWIDE 
WITH AN ADDITION WARNING POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
LIGHT SNOW AND CLOUDS CONTINUE TO SCOUR OUT FRIDAY NIGHT WHILE 
TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO FALL TO BELOW NORMAL WITH WIND CHILLS 
RANGING FROM THE SINGLE DIGITS TO THE TEENS. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN ACTIVE EXTENDED 
FORECAST. A BREAK PERIOD OF SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGING WILL PRODUCE 
DRY CONDITIONS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...BUT A DEVELOPING SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORT-WAVE WILL INDUCE CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
BY SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. THIS WAVE WILL HELP PULL A FRONT NORTH 
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR MONDAY. INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT 
AHEAD OF A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WEST OF THE AREA WILL SPREAD RAIN OVER 
THE AREA. THERE IS A CHANCE THAT PRECIPITATION MAY BEGIN AS 
SNOW/SLEET OR FREEZING RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA.

THIS BOUNDARY WILL PULL SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY...BUT 
ANOTHER NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAMS WAVES WILL PHASE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS TUESDAY. THIS SYSTEM WILL PULL NORTHEAST TOWARD THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. GFS AND ECMWF 
HAVE DIFFERENT TRACKS OF THE SURFACE LOW. GFS BRINGS THE LOW OVER 
EAST TENNESSEE...WHILE THE ECMWF IS SLIGHTLY FARTHER EAST. EITHER 
WAY..MODELS SHOW STRONG DYNAMICS OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH NORTHWEST FLOW OROGRAPHIC LIFT FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY.

DEPENDING ON LOCATION OF BEST FRONTO-GENESIS...THERE IS A POTENTIAL 
OF HEAVY RAINS WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ALSO...DEPENDING ON 
EVOLUTION/TRACK OF SURFACE LOW...PRECIPITATION MAY CHANGE OVER TO 
SNOW LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY. HEAVY SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE MOUNTAINS DUE TO A NORTHWEST 
FLOW EVENT. CONFIDENCE IS STILL LOW...BUT WILL NEED TO MONITOR FOR 
THE POTENTIAL OF HEAVY RAINS AND MOUNTAINS SNOW. THE PRECIPITATION 
MAY CHANGE TO SNOW ACROSS THE VALLEYS AS WELL LATER IN THE EVENT.

745 PM EST WED DEC 19 2012

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH A WARMER AND MORE MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY). MODELS ARE INDICTING THAT 
THIS STRONG SYSTEM WILL MOVE SLOWLY NORTHEASTWARD TONIGHT...WITH ITS 
TRAILING COLD FRONT BEGINNING TO MOVE INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
AROUND SUNRISE. A STRONG SOUTHERLY 850 MB WIND FLOW (IN EXCESS OF 60 
KT) IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF THIS 
COLD FRONT LATER TONIGHT...BUT MAINLY AFTER SUNRISE ON THURSDAY. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS STILL INDICATE A DEEP STABLE LAYER EXTENDING ABOVE 
THE MOUNTAINS...ALONG WITH A STRONG VEERING WIND PROFILE THROUGHOUT 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT DAMAGING WIND GUSTS (IN 
EXCESS OF 60 MPH) DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVES WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE 
FOOTHILLS ON THURSDAY.

HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO INCREASE WIND 
SPEEDS IN THE HIGH WIND WARNING ZONES...AND HAVE MENTIONED 
'INCREASING CLOUDINESS' EVERYWHERE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CURRENT 
SATELLITE TRENDS.

347 PM EST WED DEC 19 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE 
NE FROM OK TO W IL TONIGHT. STRONG UPPER JET SEGMENT WILL DEVELOP 
EAST OF THE UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. HIGH AND 
MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL INCREASE OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. LOW 
LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES RISE AND WITH LATE CLOUD COVER DECIDED TO GO 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE MOS TEMP GUIDANCE TONIGHT. STRONG LOW LEVEL JET 
INCREASES ACROSS THE TN VALLEY TONIGHT AND PEAKS NEAR 70 KTS ACROSS 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY THU AFTERNOON. SYNOPTIC SET UP 
FAVORABLE FOR DOWN SLOPING WINDS WEST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
THU. WIND DIRECTION EAST OF THE SMOKIES IS NOT IDEALLY SE BUT LOCAL 
AFFECTS SHOULD BE REALIZED. ANTICIPATED DOWN SLOPING WILL HINDER 
CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION EARLY IN NEAR FOOTHILLS AREAS AND ALSO 
ALLOW FOR BRIEF SPIKES IN WARMER TEMPERATURES. A STRONG COLD FRONT 
WILL MARCH EAST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY THU. ONGOING PREFRONTAL 
CONVECTION WILL MOVE OFF THE PLATEAU IN THE MORNING HOURS. BEST 
FORCING WILL BE NORTH OF THE AREA. INSTABILITY IS LIMITED BUT BULK 
SHEAR IS FAVORABLE FOR STRONG CONVECTION. ISOLATED SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE MAINLY S AND WEST OF KNOXVILLE. LOW LEVEL 
WIND CONDITIONS ALONG WARM FRONT ACROSS SOUTHERN PLATEAU MAY ALSO 
CONTRIBUTE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE STORMS. THE DEEPER 
CONVECTION WILL TAPER OFF AS THE FRONT MOVES INTO THE MOUNTAINS BY 
THU EVENING. 

.LONG TERM (THURDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PERIOD...THE COLD FRONT IS PUSHING INTO THE AREA.  STRONG 
GRADIENT WINDS WILL BE FILLING INTO THE AREA.  THE HIGH WINDS 
WARNING IS FOR PRE-FRONTAL DOWNSLOPING WINDS.  THERE MAY BE THE NEED 
FOR A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE POST-FRONTAL WINDS AS WELL...HOWEVER...
WILL NOT ISSUE AT THIS TIME TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH THE EARLIER 
WARNING.

UPSLOPE SNOWS ARE EXPECTED IN THE HIGH TERRAIN AS WELL. 
HOWEVER...MOISTURE LEVELS ARE EXPECTED TO BE DROPPING...SO 
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE LIGHT.  MAIN THREAT WILL BE VISIBILITY FROM 
WIND-BLOWN SNOW IN THESE AREAS.

BY SATURDAY...THE AREA SHOULD BE COMPLETELY BETWEEN SYSTEMS.  A WEAK 
FRONT WILL BE PUSHING INTO THE AREA AROUND MONDAY...IS EXPECTED TO 
STALL AS LOW PRESSURE BUILDS IN THE WESTERN GULF.  A BIG PUSH OF 
MOISTURE SHOULD BE COMING UP INTO THE AREA AS THE SURFACE LOW TRACKS 
TO THE NORTHEAST EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH HEAVY RAINS POSSIBLE WHEN 
THE MAIN AXIS OF PRECIPITATION MOVES THROUGH.  PRECIPITABLE WATER 
CLIMATOLOGY SUGGESTS THAT WE WILL BE NEAR THE 95TH PERCENTILE ON THE 
PWAT...MEANING LOTS OF MOISTURE TO INTENSIFY RAINFALL RATES.  THE 
MAIN AXIS WILL BE MOVING THROUGH DURING ABOUT A 24 HOUR TIME 
PERIOD...SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MONDAY AND WEDNESDAY.  MODELS ARE HAVING 
A TERRIBLE TIME DETERMINING THE SPECIFICS OF TIMING WITH THIS 
SYSTEM. WILL NEED TO WATCH THIS SYSTEM FOR HEAVY RAIN/POSSIBLE FLOOD 
THREAT EARLY NEXT WEEK...INCLUDING CHRISTMAS DAY. WHEN THIS SYSTEM 
EXITS...WE WILL LIKELY HAVE SOME THREAT OF UPSLOPE NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW SNOWS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. THIS IS JUST BEYOND THE CURRENT 
TIMING OF THIS FORECAST.

240 PM EST TUE DEC 18 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SKIES HAVE BECOME MOSTLY SUNNY 
OVER ALL BUT THE EXTREME NE TN CORNER AND SW VA THIS AFTERNOON AS 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BEHIND EXITING TROUGH WHICH BROUGHT 
A FEW SPRINKLES TO THE NE PART OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. 
TEMPERATURES AT MID AFTERNOON RANGE FROM THE 40S EXTREME NE WHERE 
CLOUDS HAVE LINGERED TO THE LOWER TO MID 50S ELSEWHERE. WINDS ARE 
GENERALLY LIGHT BUT ARE STILL AROUND 10 TO 15 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 25 
MPH EXTREME NE BECAUSE OF THE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN SURFACE LOW 
OVER THE NE AND HIGHER PRESSURE OVER AL. THESE WINDS WILL GRADUALLY 
DECREASE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AS SURFACE LOW MOVES 
AWAY. FORECAST AREA WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
BEFORE A DEVELOPING SYSTEM NOW FORMING OVER THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST 
APPROACHES.

SKIES WILL STAY MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS SURFACE HIGH 
MOVES ALONG THE GULF COAST AND 500 MB RIDGE MOVES THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE COOLER THAN THIS MORNING BUT STILL 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL. FULL SUNSHINE WITH A SOUTHWEST WIND ALOFT 
WILL ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY TO REACH THE MID 50S TO MID 
60S SOME 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL ONE 
MAIN SYSTEM AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVING INTO 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY. A STRONG SOUTHERLY 850 MB WIND FLOW (IN EXCESS 
OF 60 KT) IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF 
THIS COLD FRONT...WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATING A DEEP STABLE 
LAYER EXTENDING ABOVE THE MOUNTAINS AND A STRONG VEERING WIND 
PROFILE THROUGHOUT THE BOUNDARY LAYER. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT 
DAMAGING WINDS DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVES WILL BE A GOOD POSSIBILITY LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING ALONG THE FOOTHILLS OF THE 
MOUNTAINS. THE NAM MODEL INDICATES THAT THE LOW-LEVEL WIND FLOW MAY 
BE MORE SOUTHWESTERLY (WHICH IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST IDEAL WIND 
DIRECTION FOR MOUNTAIN WAVE DEVELOPMENT)...THE GFS MODEL INDICATES A 
MORE SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW WHICH WOULD BE PERPENDICULAR ENOUGH TO THE 
MOUNTAIN RIDGES FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A STRONG MOUNTAIN WAVE WIND 
EVENT. SINCE IT APPEARS THAT THE OTHER CONDITIONS NECESSARY FOR A 
STRONG MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT SHOULD BE IN PLACE...WILL ISSUE A HIGH 
WIND WATCH FOR LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING ALONG THE 
FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS.

MODELS AGREE THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL BE OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
AROUND 18Z ON THURSDAY...WITH AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF SHOWERS OCCURRING 
ALONG AND AHEAD OF IT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THIS COLD 
FRONT...SO WILL ALSO MENTION A CHANCE OF TSTORMS ON THURSDAY. WITH 
THE STRONG 850 MB JET EXPECTED AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...THINK THAT 
SOME DAMAGING WINDS COULD ALSO BE POSSIBLE IN THE VALLEY AREAS WITH 
ANY OF THE STRONGER CONVECTION. MODELS INDICATE THAT PRECIP WILL 
CHANGE OVER TO SNOW IN MOST AREAS ON THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH A 
NORTHWESTERLY UPSLOPE WIND FLOW PRODUCING SOME SCATTERED SNOW 
SHOWERS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. RIGHT NOW...MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE 
LIMITED ENOUGH FOR JUST SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. QUIET CONDITIONS THEN DEVELOP FOR THE WEEKEND AND 
INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH SHOWERS INCREASING ON TUESDAY AHEAD OF 
THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARD THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SKIES REMAIN CLOUDY TO MOSTLY 
CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON WITH GENERALLY LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS MOVING NE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK SHORTWAVE ABOUT TO 
EXIT THE REGION INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. STRONG TO SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS PRODUCING LARGE HAIL AND HIGH WINDS HAVE DEVELOPED 
WITH SCATTERED ACTIVITY MOVING INTO WESTERN KY AND TN JUST WEST OF 
BNA. AIR MASS TO THE WEST OF THE PLATEAU BECOMING UNSTABLE AS SKIES 
HAVE CLEARED AHEAD OF STRONGER SHORTWAVE MOVING INTO THE MS AND 
LOWER OH VALLEYS.

THESE STORMS LIKELY TO CONTINUE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE WEAKENING 
AS THEY MOVE INTO MORE STABLE AIRMASS IN EAST TN. NAM AND RUC MODELS 
FORECAST THIS AREA TO MOVE MOSTLY NE INTO SE KY LATER THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. TEMPERATURES OVER FORECAST AREA ARE NOW IN THE LOWER 
50S NE AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO MID 50S TO NEAR 60 EXCEPT LOWER 60S 
AT CHA. A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE EITHER LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING MAINLY PLATEAU AND CENTRAL VALLEY WITH 
HAIL TO ONE INCH AND DAMAGING WIND GUSTS. COLD FRONT ALONG MS RIVER 
WILL SWING THROUGH THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY AND MOUNTAINS BY 
LATE TONIGHT ENDING PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTH THIS EVENING. A 
SECONDARY FRONT AND SHORTWAVE EARLY TUESDAY WILL ALLOW SHOWERS TO 
LINGER ACROSS SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN INTO EARLY TUESDAY MORNING. 
SKIES WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR LATE TONIGHT FROM THE SW AND BY TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON CLOUDS SHOULD START TO BREAK UP OVER NE SECTIONS. NAM/GFS 
GUIDANCE SIMILAR TONIGHT SO FOLLOWED CLOSE AND FOR TUESDAY AS WELL. 
HIGHS TUESDAY WILL STILL BE ABOUT 5 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL ALL AREAS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL ONE 
MAIN SYSTEM AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WILL BRING DRY AND TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS ON WEDNESDAY...WHICH WILL THEN MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE 
LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A STRONG 850 MB LOW-LEVEL 
JET (IN EXCESS OF 50 KT) IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY AHEAD OF ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT. MODEL SOUNDINGS AROUND THE 
MOUNTAINS INDICATE A VEERING WIND PROFILE...SOUTH TO SOUTHEASTERLY 
LOW-LEVEL WINDS PERPENDICULAR TO THE MOUNTAINS...AND A DEEP STABLE 
LAYER EXTENDING ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT 
DAMAGING WINDS DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVES WILL BE A GOOD POSSIBILITY LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING ALONG THE FOOTHILLS OF THE 
MOUNTAINS. FOR NOW...WILL PLAN TO MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY IN THE 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK...BUT HIGH WIND WATCHES AND/OR WARNINGS 
MAY BE NEEDED FOR THE FOOTHILLS IN LATER FORECASTS. MODELS AGREE 
THAT MOISTURE WILL DECREASE RAPIDLY BEHIND THE COLD FRONT THURSDAY 
NIGHT...SO THAT THE CHANGE OVER TO SNOW SHOWERS BEHIND THE FRONT 
SHOULD BE QUICK AND MOSTLY LIMITED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ANOTHER 
WEAK COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY...BUT THE MODELS INDICATE THAT LIMITED 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT SHOULD RESULT MAINLY IN JUST AN INCREASE 
IN CLOUDS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARD THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS

ENSEMBLE MEANS.

WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS AND AT THE TAIL END OF

RAINFALL HAS GRADUALLY BECOME LIGHTER THIS AFTERNOON AS STRONGER 
FORCING HAS SHIFTED SOUTH AND EAST OF OUR AREA. CATEGORICAL POPS 
WILL CONTINUE IN SOUTHERN AREAS THROUGH THE EVENING...WITH CHANCE 
POPS NORTH. A LULL IN THE PRECIP COMES AFTER MIDNIGHT AS BOTH THE 
NAM AND THE GFS SHOW SOME MIDLEVEL DRYING. HOWEVER THE MODELS 
DIVERGE SIGNIFICANTLY LATE TONIGHT. THE GFS PLACES OUR AREA IN THE 
DRY SLOT BENEATH THE UPPER JET...PRODUCING VERY LITTLE PRECIP. THE 
NAM SHOWS PRECIP BLOSSOMING AROUND 09Z ACROSS NRN AL/GA...SPREADING 
NORTHWARD THROUGH THE MORNING. A FRONTOGENETIC ZONE AND GOOD QG 
FORCING RESULT IN A HALF TO ONE INCH OF QPF AMOUNTS IN THE NAM 
BETWEEN 12-18Z. THE NAM WILL BE PREFERRED AS IT HAS BEEN PERFORMING 
WELL SO FAR WITH THIS SYSTEM...ALTHOUGH WILL BUMP ITS QPF AMOUNTS 
DOWN. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MENTIONED AS THERE 
WILL BE SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY. PRECIP CHANCES BEGIN TO FALL IN 
THE AFTERNOON AS A 850-700 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES THROUGH. THE 
MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH PASSAGE IS DELAYED UNTIL AFTER 00Z...SO WILL 
CARRY CHANCE POPS INTO MONDAY NIGHT. DRY ADVECTION AND PASSAGE OF 
THE SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL BRING AN END TO POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
WITH PASSAGE OF MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH LATE MONDAY NIGHT...SKIES
WILL CLEAR FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST BECOMING MOSTLY SUNNY
TUESDAY. A FEW CLOUDS LINGER NE OTHERWISE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.
HIGHS NEAR TO ABOVE NORMAL SOUTH AND CLOSE TO NORMAL NORTH. COOLER
TEMPERATURES NORTHERN AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS WHERE CLOUDS WILL
LINGER IN THE MORNING. SURFACE HIGH MOVES EAST ALONG GULF COAST TO
REACH SOUTHEAST COAST BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. RIDGING ALOFT KEEPS SKIES
MOSTLY CLEAR. WEDNESDAY WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER AS CENTER OF
HIGH SHIFTS FARTHER SOUTH AND EAST...AND SOUTH WINDS DEVELOP. NEXT
WEATHER SYSTEM TO AFFECT REGION THURSDAY. SURFACE LOW DEEPENS OVER
MID MS VALLEY THURSDAY AND RAPIDLY MOVES NE INTO THE EASTERN GREAT
LAKES FRIDAY. SHOWERS BECOME LIKELY THURSDAY. MUCH COLDER AIRMASS
BEHIND COLD FRONT THURSDAY NIGHT TO CHANGE PRECIPITATION TO SNOW
SHOWERS BEFORE ENDING OVERNIGHT VALLEYS AND FRIDAY NORTHEAST AND
EASTERN MOUNTAINS. AMOUNTS IN THE MOUNTAINS COULD BE A COUPLE OF
INCHES BUT IN THE VALLEY AREAS TOO EARLY TO TELL IF ANY COULD
ACCUMULATE BEFORE MOISTURE MOVES OUT AND IF TEMPERATURES GET COLD
ENOUGH FOR SNOW TO STICK BEFORE ENDING. HIGHS FRIDAY ONLY EXPECTED
TO REACH THE LOWER 30S HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND PARTS OF THE NE WITH
LOWER TO MID 40S ELSEWHERE. FRIDAY NIGHT LOWS IN THE 20S. THEN SLOW
WARMING TREND OVER THE WEEKEND AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT WILL 
REMAIN TO OUR WEST...AND WILL BEGIN ADVANCING EAST TOWARD THE AREA 
LATE IN THE PERIOD. SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL PROVIDE PLENTY OF 
MOISTURE OVER THE AREA...AND WHILE EXACT TIMING STILL 
DIFFICULT...APPEARS THERE WILL BE A COUPLE OF PERIODS OF ENHANCED 
SHOWER ACTIVITY DURING THE PERIOD. A WEAK SHORT WAVE THIS MORNING 
WILL BRING A ROUND OF SHOWERS...WITH ANOTHER SURGE OF SHOWERS 
EXPECTED LATER TONIGHT AS THE MORE SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS 
TO OUR WEST AND APPROACHES.  APPEARS THERE WILL BE ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY FOR SOME THUNDER AS WELL...ESPECIALLY SOUTH.  WILL CARRY 
CAT POPS ALL ZONES TODAY AND CAT SOUTH WITH LIKELY NORTH TONIGHT. 
WILL GO CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS...ALTHOUGH WILL TWEAK MOST MAV TEMPS UP 
SLIGHTLY FOR TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A HEALTHY SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
PROGRESSES EASTWARD ACROSS THE MID AND DEEP SOUTH ON MONDAY. THE 
SYSTEM SHOULD HAVE MORE THAN SUFFICIENT MOISTURE FOR LIFTING AHEAD 
OF THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY. AND THERE WILL BE 
YET ANOTHER CHANCE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION AS MODELS PROG 
ADEQUATE INSTABILITY DURING THE DAY. MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE ON 
THE DECREASE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY BEHIND THE DEPARTING STORM 
SYSTEM. THE DRY REGIME MAY CONTINUE ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE EVENING 
HOURS WEDNESDAY AS THE FORECAST AREA ENJOYS A BRIEF PERIOD OF 
RIDGING. THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL 
BE KNOCKING ON THE DOOR LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MODELS CONTINUE TO 
SHOW A RATHER AMPLIFIED HEIGHT PATTERN WITH THIS SYSTEM AND EVEN 
THOUGH THE EVENT IS ON DAY 5...THE STRENGTH OF THIS FEATURE AND 
MODEL AGREEMENT PUSH PROBABILITY OF PRECIP TO THE LIKELY CATEGORY. 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION (85H TEMPS AROUND -5 TO -10 C) AND 
SUFFICIENTLY DEEP MOISTURE ALONG WITH A NICE UPSLOPE COMPONENT 
SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SNOW SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN THURSDAY NIGHT. A FEW SNOW SHOWERS MAY CONTINUE IN 
THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE TENNESSEE-NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY FRIDAY. THE DEEP COLD 
TROUGH MOVES AWAY FOR THE WEEKEND WHICH SHOULD BRING SUNSHINE BACK 
TO THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA WITH SLIGHTLY WARMER HIGH TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
A BAND OF PRECIP ACROSS MIDDLE TN APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THETA-E ADVECTION AND CONVERGENCE IN THE 925-700 MB LAYER. THE NAM 
SHOWS THE THETA-E RIDGE EXTENDING INTO OUR AREA AFTER 00Z...ALONG 
WITH STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ACROSS THE PLATEAU 
OVERNIGHT. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS WEST TO CHANCE POPS EAST...AND A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS WEST WHERE 850 MB THETA-E VALUES WILL 
EXCEED 320K. WILL LEAN TOWARD WARMER GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS TONIGHT 
GIVEN EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND WARM ADVECTION.

DEEPER FORCING FOR LIFT DEVELOPS ON SUNDAY AS THE UPPER JET MOVES 
INTO THE TN VALLEY REIONG...WITH Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE AND A BAND OF 
MIDLEVEL FRONTOGENESIS ACROSS OUR AREA. ALONG WITH CATEGORICAL 
POPS...THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AREA-WIDE WITH 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY PRESENT AT OR ABOVE 850 MB. SYNOPTIC LIFT AND 
INSTABILITY DECREASE SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER JET WEAKENS AND THE 
FRONTOGENESIS ZONE SHIFTS TO OUR EAST. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW A PERIOD 
OF MID-UPPER LEVEL DRY AIR ABOVE 700 MB. POPS WILL DROP BACK TO 
LIKELY SOUTH TO CHANCE NORTH IN THE EVENING AND CONTINUE THROUGH
THE NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
BROAD TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE SE STATES MONDAY. A SURFACE
LOW THAT DEVELOPS OVER THE MS VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT DEEPENS AS IT
MOVES NE THROUGH THE OH VALLEY. SHORT WAVE ENERGY OUT AHEAD OF THE
LOW AND COLD FRONT SHOULD TRIGGER MORE CONVECTION ACROSS EAST TN
AND THE SE MONDAY. WARM AND MOIST SW FLOW WILL ADD FUEL TO THE
STORMS WHICH MAY BECOME STRONG ACROSS THE SE STATES AND PART OF THE
OHIO VALLEY. BEST THREAT FOR CONVECTION WILL BE PLATEAU AND SOUTH
VALLEY INTO SE TN AND SW NORTH CAROLINA MONDAY. HIGHS MONDAY WILL
WARM IN THE UPPER 50S TO UPPER 60S WITH DEW POINTS IN THE 50S. AN
AVERAGE OF ONE HALF TO ONE INCH OF RAIN MAY FALL ACROSS SOUTHERN
SECTIONS WITH ANTICIPATED CONVECTION MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.
MONDAY NIGHT MUCH COLDER AIR MASS WILL DROP FREEZING LEVELS TO
BETWEEN 4 AND 5 THOUSAND FEET. LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY
MORNING COULD SEE AN INCH OR SO OF SNOW AT THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS
FOR NOW NO SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION AND WILL JUST MENTION CHANCE AT
HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. TUESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING
RIDGING ALOFT AND WEAK SURFACE HIGH BRINGS SHORT BREAK IN WET
PATTERN.

EARLY THURSDAY A MORE DEVELOPED SYSTEM WILL MOVE RAPIDLY FROM THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES BY FRIDAY. CLOUDS AND RAIN 
SHOULD SPREAD INTO THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. BEHIND 
THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MUCH COLDER AIRMASS WILL CHANGE RAIN TO 
SNOW THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY EVENING. WITH NW FLOW TRAJECTORY IN 
PLACE HIGHER ELEVATIONS SHOULD RECEIVE SOME SNOWFALL WITH THE LOWER 
ELEVATIONS ALSO HAVING SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES BEFORE 
THE PRECIPITATION ENDS EARLY FRIDAY. LOWS WILL BE MOSTLY ABOVE 
FREEZING MONDAY NIGHT EXCEPT NEAR FREEZING HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. HIGHS 
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY COOLER THAN MONDAY BUT STILL ABOVE NORMAL. 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY MUCH COOLER BEHIND FRONT. MAY BE THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW PRESSURE IN THE PLAINS WILL 
LIFT NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION...AND A COLD FRONT WILL 
APPROACH SLOWLY BUT WILL STILL BE WELL TO OUR WEST BY END OF THE 
SHORT TERM PERIOD.  MOISTURE WILL INCREASE AHEAD OF THIS 
SYSTEM...AND MAY SEE A FEW SHOWERS MAINLY WEST TODAY.  CHANCES FOR 
RAIN WILL INCREASE TONIGHT. WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TODAY WEST 
ZONES...THEN LIKELY SOUTHWEST AND CHANCE ELSEWHERE BY LATE TONIGHT. 
MAY BE ENOUGH ELEVATED INSTABILITY FOR A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER 
SOUTHWEST AREAS LATE TONIGHT...BUT AT THIS POINT DOES NOT LOOK VERY 
FAVORABLE SO NO MENTION OF THUNDER.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...INITIAL SHORT WAVE MOVES 
NORTHEAST THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES EARLY ON SUNDAY LEAVING A WEAK 
SURFACE BOUNDARY BEHIND ACROSS THE OHIO THROUGH MID MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY. A CONVERGENT...MOIST AND UNSTABLE SOUTHWEST FLOW SHOULD BE 
ABLE TO SPARK SOME SHOWERS AND EVEN A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE 
REGION DURING THE DAY SUNDAY. SO KEPT LIKELY POPS GOING FROM THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST AND ADJUSTED PARTS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA TO CATEGORICAL 
RANGE WHERE DEEPEST MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL OCCUR. TRAILING SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL PRESS NORTHEAST 
TOWARD THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY NIGHT EVENTUALLY DRAGGING THE STALLED 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
BY 12Z TUESDAY. LOOKS LIKE ATMOSPHERE MAY BE UNSTABLE ENOUGH TO 
SUPPORT MORE CONVECTION WITH THE SECOND UPPER TROUGH SO INCLUDED 
THROUGH MID DAY MONDAY. THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF MONDAY 
NIGHT MOST OF THE AREA BUT LEFT A SMALL/SLIGHT CHANCE GOING ACROSS 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS EVEN INTO TUESDAY MORNING AS WEST TO 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW FILLS IN BEHIND THE DEPARTED SURFACE SYSTEM. 
PERIOD OF RIDGING KEEPS A DRY FORECAST IN PLACE TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT BUT ANOTHER MID LATITUDE CYCLONE MOVES 
QUICKLY EAST ON THURSDAY AS A DEEP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BUILDS INTO 
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. STAYED WITH MEDIUM AND HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS FOR THE LATE WEEK EVENT. THIS AMPLIFIED SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT 
WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL POLAR AIR WELL SOUTH INTO THE BACK 
SIDE OF THE PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE MODELS SHOW A NICE SWATH OF 
TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY ALONG WITH RELATIVELY DEEP MOISTURE 
ADVECTING INTO THE REGION THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. THE CHILLY 
NORTHWEST FLOW WOULD LIKELY RESULT IN OROGRAPHIC SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE HIGHER TERRAIN ON THE NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER SO APPLIED THIS SCENARIO TO THE FORECAST.

A TROUGH AND UPPER JET OVER THE DESERT SW WILL BE LIFTING NE TOWARD 
THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. HIGH CLOUDS WILL BE 
INCREASING TONIGHT AS THE SOUTHERN STREAM JET INTENSIFIES AND 
EXTENDS EASTWARD. THIS CLOUD COVER SHOULD RESULT IN LOW TEMPS WARMER

VORT MAX IS SHOWN BY THE NAM AND GFS TO CROSS OUR AREA IN THE 
MORNING...WHICH MAY BRING LIGHT PRECIP TO THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. 
HOWEVER WITH LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND WEAK LIFT...WILL HAVE

AHEAD OF COLD FRONT THAT WILL ADVANCE EAST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY
SUNDAY AND INTO THE APPALACHIANS SUNDAY NIGHT. SFC DEW POINTS WILL
REACH THE 50S SUNDAY AND SLIGHT INSTABILITY WILL ALLOW FOR A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP LATER SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT WITH 60 KNOT
WINDS AT 500 MB AND STRONG 0-6KM SHEAR PER DAY 3 OUTLOOK SOME
STRONG STORMS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS MAINLY SOUTHERN AND WESTERN
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS STILL SHOW FRONT SLOWING AS
NEW LOW PRESSURE AREA DEVELOPS ALONG FRONT MONDAY AND THEN MOVES NE
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS WILL CONTINUE GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS
MONDAY AND MORE THUNDER CHANCES BEFORE FRONT FINALLY MOVES SOUTH
AND EAST OF THE REGION TUESDAY.

COLDER MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH SHOWERS MAINLY EAST MONDAY 
NIGHT AND NORTH TUESDAY WITH COLDER AIR TUESDAY TEMPERATURES LOWER 
BUT HIGHS STILL MID 40S TO MID 50S. BRIEF DRYING AS RIDGING BUILDS 
IN TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THURSDAY NEW DEVELOPING SYSTEM

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
AREA WILL SHIFT EAST DURING THE PERIOD.  MOISTURE WILL START TO 
INCREASE...WITH INCREASING HIGH CLOUDS ESPECIALLY TONIGHT WHEN SOME 
MID CLOUDS MAY START MOVING IN AS WELL.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
GOOD...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.    

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...ACTIVE PATTERN WITH SEVERAL 
FEATURES TO AFFECT THE REGION DURING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST. 
MODELS GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT EARLY IN THE PERIOD BUT DIVERGE LATE 
WITH STRENGTH AND TIMING ISSUES. STAYED WITH A GFS/ECMWF BLEND FOR 
THIS PACKAGE. THE FIRST WAVE BUILDS NORTHEAST FROM THE PLAINS ON 
SATURDAY INTO SOUTHEASTERN CANADA BY 12Z SUNDAY WEAKENING DURING ITS 
JOURNEY. HOWEVER...NICE LOW LEVEL JET ADDS MOISTURE TO THE COLUMN 
LATER SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...MOISTURE THAT SHOULD BE LIFTED 
EFFECTIVELY AHEAD OF THE STORM SYSTEM COLD FRONT. THERE MAY EVEN BE 
ENOUGH INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF 
CONVECTION OVER WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA SO 
MAINTAINED THIS IDEA WHILE TWEAKING POPS TO LIKELY ON SUNDAY FOR 
MOST OF THE REGION. WITH THE WEAKENING WAVE RIPPING QUICKLY 
NORTHEAST AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WILL SLOW DOWN. ON MONDAY...A TRAILING SHORT WAVE WILL RIDE 
NORTHEAST ALONG A SIMILAR PATH AS THE FIRST WAVE AND WILL DEEPEN 
OVER THE EASTERN LAKES WHICH SHOULD HELP TO PULL THE COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA SO HELD ONTO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS 
MONDAY WHILE DECREASING TO SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY AS ENERGY DROPS SOUTHEAST IN THE CYCLONIC FLOW AROUND 
THE EASTERN LAKES UPPER LOW. A NICE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE 
EASTERN U.S. AT MID WEEK KEEPING DRY CONDITIONS IN PLACE. YET 
ANOTHER AMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE REGION ON THURSDAY AND ADJUSTED POPS A LITTLE 
HIGHER FROM SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE FOR THIS EVENT WHICH MAY HAVE SOME 
SNOW MIXED IN WITH THE COLD AIR ADVECTION PATTERN BEHIND THE 
DEPARTING FRONT THURSDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SATELLITE IMAGERY DEPICTING A
FEW CLOUDS ALONG THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. THEY SHOULD
EXIT THE REGION EARLY TODAY AS A DRIER AIRMASS PUSHES IN. LATEST
OBSERVATIONS INDICATING FREEZING FOG AT TRI-CITIES. ONLY ISOLATED
FOG IS EXPECTED THIS MORNING...MAINLY NEAR THE LAKES... STREAMS AND
OTHER BODIES OF WATER SO WILL NOT ADD IN THE ZONE PACKAGE.
OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE REGION WILL BRING DRY WEATHER
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT ALONG WITH A LITTLE WARMER TEMPERATURES.
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURE LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE 
BECOMING MORE OUT-OF-PHASE WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN FOR EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...BUT THEY GENERALLY AGREE THAT AN UNSETTLED PATTERN WILL 
DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHEAST. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN IS DRIER AND LESS 
ACTIVE OVER THE FORECAST AREA THAN THE ECMWF MODEL FOR EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...WITH THE CANADIAN MODEL APPEARING TO AGREE MORE WITH THE GFS 
MODEL THAN THE ECMWF MODEL (ALTHOUGH THE CANADIAN MODEL HAS BEEN 
VERY INCONSISTENT FROM RUN TO RUN LATELY). WILL PLAN TO TREND THE 
EXTENDED FORECAST TOWARDS THE ECMWF MODEL SOLUTION...SINCE IT HAS 
BEEN MORE CONSISTENT OVER THE LAST FEW MODEL RUNS AND IS GENERALLY A 
BETTER MODEL IN THE EXTENDED PERIODS THAN THE OTHER MODELS. 

WITH THIS IN MIND...IT APPEARS THAT A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION 
PATTERN WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. THIS FRONT WILL LIKELY STALL OUT BEFORE 
REACHING THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON SUNDAY. THE ECMWF MODEL THEN 
QUICKLY DEVELOPS ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ON TUESDAY FURTHER 
SOUTH ALONG THE SOUTHEASTERN ATLANTIC COAST...WITH SHOWERS EXPECTED 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE EXACT TRACK OF THIS 
LOW WILL DETERMINE HOW MUCH COLD AIR CAN BE PULLED INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SNOW...BUT RIGHT NOW...THE ECMWF MODEL 
INDICATES THAT IT WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY. BASED ON THE CURRENT ECMWF SOLUTION...THIS SNOW WILL BE 
THE RESULT OF NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...AND SO WOULD THINK THAT ANY 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS 
FOR TEMPS IN THE EXTENDED FORECAST...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT THEREAFTER...WILL 
TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
ECMWF SOLUTION.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRY WEATHER PUSHING INTO THE
AREA BEHIND THE FRONT. A WEAK TROUGH WILL BRING A FEW HIGH CLOUDS
TODAY WITH A PARTLY SUNNY SKY EXPECTED. BUT NO PRECIPITATION IS
ANTICIPATED. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY
WHICH SHOULD BE NEAR SEASONAL LEVELS. THE CLOUDS SHOULD EXIT
TONIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BRINGING A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY.
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE AGAIN FOR TONIGHT WITH
ANOTHER NIGHT WITH NEAR SEASONAL TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL
AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN THROUGH EARLY NEXT
WEEK...BUT DIFFER ON THE DETAILS OF HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE
AVAILABLE WITH THE TWO SYSTEMS AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA THIS
WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE DOMINATING THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WHICH WILL
BRING DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT (ALONG WITH
A WARMING TREND). MODELS AGREE THAT A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE
FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION
THIS WEEKEND. ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER
VALLEY ON SUNDAY...WITH A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN AHEAD
OF IT PRODUCING SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY ON SATURDAY NIGHT. THE ECMWF
MODEL THEN DEVELOPS A FAIRLY STRONG SECONDARY LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS BY SUNDAY NIGHT...WHICH WOULD KEEP SHOWERS OVER THE
FORECAST AREA THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. SINCE THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS
DIFFER ON THIS SOLUTION (AND THIS LATEST WET ECMWF SOLUTION HAS
ONLY JUST APPEARED WITH THIS MODEL RUN)...WILL TREND TOWARDS A
COMPROMISE SOLUTION BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS FOR NOW. ANOTHER LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM IS THEN PROGGED BY BOTH MODELS TO DEVELOP OVER THE
SOUTHEAST ON TUESDAY...BUT THE EXACT TRACK REMAINS IN QUESTION AS
BOTH MODELS HAVE BEEN FLIP-FLOPPING WITH ITS TRACK OVER THE LAST
FEW MODEL RUNS. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THAT THE TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT
TIMEFRAME WILL BE UNSETTLED...WITH THE EXACT TRACK DETERMINING HOW
MUCH COLD AIR CAN BE PULLED INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE
POSSIBILITY OF SNOW. FOR NOW...WILL NOT MENTION ANY SNOW
POSSIBILITIES OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND
TOWARDS THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH SATURDAY...BUT
THEREAFTER...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE COOLER ENSEMBLE MEANS DUE TO
THE UNSETTLED CONDITIONS AND LIKELY CLOUD COVER.

THE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS
MORNING. SOME REPORTS OF FLURRIES WERE OCCURRING OVER PARTS OF
SEVIER AND COCKE COUNTIES. DUAL-POL RADAR WAS VERIFYING THE REPORTS
AND CURRENTLY SHOWS THE AREAS OF FLURRIES DECREASING RAPIDLY. 

EXPECT THE CLOUDS TO BEGIN MIXING OUT THIS AFTERNOON FROM SOUTHWEST
TO NORTHEAST. THE FORECAST HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL DEPEND ON THE
CLOUDS BREAKING UP SHORTLY AFTER NOON BUT DO NOT SEE ANY REASON WHY
THAT SHOULD NOT OCCUR. MINOR GRID UPDATE TO CLOUD COVER FOR THIS
AFTERNOON. EVERYTHING ELSE IN THE SHORT-TERM PACKAGE LOOKED FINE

COLD FRONT STILL APPROACHING AREA...EXPECTING IT TO MOVE INTO NWRN
CWA AROUND 18Z...THEN FINALLY CLEARING ERN CWA THIS
EVENING...PROBABLY PRIOR TO MIDNIGHT. WITH ALL THE RAIN OVER THE
AREA NOW...THE AIR MASS IS PRETTY STABLE. LIGHTNING THAT HAD MOVED
THROUGH THE AREA BEFORE SUNRISE HAS NOW MOVED AWAY TO THE EAST AND
HAS FADED. UPSTREAM CLOSEST LIGHTNING NOW IS BACK NEAR KBHM.
ANOTHER SURGE OF WIND/RICHER MOISTURE IS EXPECTED TO PUSH UP INTO
THE REGION IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON...SO THE AIR MASS COULD
DESTABILIZE SOMEWHAT. WILL GO WITH CHANCE OF THUNDER SOUTH AND
SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AREAS. CHANCES OF
SEVERE STORMS LOOKING IFFY AT BEST...SINCE STABILITY RECOVERY WILL
BE LIMITED. LOOKS LIKE MOST STRONGER STORMS WILL STAY SOUTH OF
AREA.

WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT ON PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN HALF OF EASTERN
MOUNTAINS. WINDS OVERALL VERY LIGHT RIGHT NOW...AFOREMENTIONED
SURGE LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BUMP WINDS UP AGAIN ON SOUTHERN PLATEAU
AND SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON...BUT IT LOOKS LIKE FRONT
WILL CUT OFF THE CHANCES FOR THESE WINDS ON THE NORTHERN PLATEAU.
WILL CANCEL WIND ADVISORY FOR NORTHERN PLATEAU. WILL KEEP IT
RUNNING FOR SOUTHERN PLATEAU...BUT TRIMMING ITS EXPIRATION TIME
BACK A COUPLE OF HOURS DUE TO FRONTAL PASSAGE. WILL LEAVE SOUTHERN
MOUNTAINS WIND ADVISORY AS- IS.

THE NEXT ROUND OF CONVECTION IN EACH TAF FOR A COUPLE OF HOURS 
BETWEEN 18 AND 22Z. OVERALL...EXPECT MVFR CONDITIONS FOR MOST OF THE 
DAY...WITH SOME TEMPORARY IFR CONDITIONS AND GUSTY WINDS WITH ANY 
CONVECTION. WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE WEST OR NORTHWEST BY LATE 
AFTERNOON AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE...WITH CEILINGS REMAINING IN THE

340 AM EST MON DEC 10 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
STRONG COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM NEAR CINCINNATI SOUTHWEST TO NEAR 
NASHVILLE AND TUPELO. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY ADVANCE 
EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING...AND SHOULD BE 
LOCATED DIRECTLY OVER THE FORECAST AREA AROUND NOON. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL A SOLID LINE OF CONVECTION AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT...WHICH 
WAS BEGINNING TO AFFECT THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES. THE LATEST 
NAM MODEL RUN NOW REVEALS A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY...ALTHOUGH THE GFS MODEL CONTINUES 
TO SHOW A MORE STABLE AIR MASS. AS A RESULT...WILL PLAN TO 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SOLUTIONS BY MENTIONING SHOWERS WITH 
SCATTERED TSTORMS EVERYWHERE FOR TODAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL WIND FIELD WILL DEVELOP ALONG THIS COLD 
FRONT...WITH A 850 MB JET AROUND 50 KT EXPECTED. THUS... WILL 
CONTINUE THE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 
FEET...AND WILL EXPAND IT IN AREA TO COVER THE SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS 
AND IN TIME UNTIL 6 PM THIS EVENING. IF THE NAM MODEL'S FORECAST OF 
SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY MATERIALIZES...THEN IT APPEARS POSSIBLE 
FOR AN ISOLATED TORNADO OR TWO TO FORM (MAINLY OVER THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA) DUE TO THE LARGE HELICITY VALUES OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL 
DECREASE RAPIDLY TONIGHT BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT...SO THINK THAT ANY 
SNOW DEVELOPMENT ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE PRECIP SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET WITH NOT MUCH ACCUMULATIONS. 
AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT (MAINLY DUE TO SLIGHT TIMING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE COLD FRONT)...AND WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE TWO.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EAST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY...AND IN ITS WAKE COOLER AIR WILL 
FILTER INTO THE REGION...DROPPING HIGH TEMPERATURES INTO THE 40S 
AREAWIDE. THOUGH ANY RAIN SHOWERS SHOULD BE EAST OF THE 
AREA...ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH SWINGING ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL PULL 
SOME MOISTURE AND PRECIP BACK ALONG THE LEE SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. MODELS HAVE TRENDED THIS FURTHER 
EAST...WITH ALL OF THE QPF SIGNALS AND BEST DYNAMICS OCCURRING 
ACROSS THE CAROLINAS AND GEORGIA. THUS...HAVE KEPT MENTIONABLE POPS 
OUT OF THE FORECAST DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. SUBTROPICAL RIDGING 
OVER THE REGION WILL PROMOTE FAIR WEATHER FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY...ALONG WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND AS HIGHS WILL RETURN TO 
THE 50S TO LOW 60S BY THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. HOWEVER...ANOTHER 
UPPER-TROUGH WILL PUSH INTO THE REGION THIS WEEKEND AND BRING AN 
ADDITIONAL SHOT OF PRECIPITATION. AS A RESULT HAVE GONE CHANCE POPS 
AREAWIDE FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF SUNDAY 
NIGHT FROM WEST TO EAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...BRUNT OF SIGNIFICANT WEATHER 
OCCURS IN THE SHORT TERM...SIMILAR TO TIMING IN PREVIOUS FORECAST 
GRIDS. SHOWERS PASS ACROSS NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA EARLY TONIGHT...
THEN A BREAK BEFORE MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION MOVES IN TOWARD AND 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. THERE IS SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY NOTED WITH 
CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT...MAINLY ACROSS WRN 
AREAS. 

FAVORED THE STRONGER NAM LOW LEVEL JET WHICH SUPPORTS A WIND 
ADVISORY FOR THE PLATEAU AND SMOKY MOUNTAINS LATE TONIGHT INTO EARLY 
MONDAY AFTERNOON. GUSTY OR DAMAGING WINDS APPEAR TO BE THE MAIN 
THREAT...WITH STRONG LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND DEEP LIFT WITH THE 
FRONTAL PASSAGE. DOWNWARD TRANSFER OF MOMENTUM WITH MORNING 
CONVECTION WILL LIKELY ENHANCE THE WIND GUSTS. OPTED TO LEAVE SW VA 
AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES OUT OF THE WIND ADVISORY FOR 
NOW...LETTING MIDNIGHT SHIFT DECIDE IF ADVISORY IS JUSTIFIED 
ELSEWHERE.

OTHERWISE...MIN TEMPS SHOULD BE AT LEAST A COUPLE TO FEW DEGREES 
ABOVE GFS MOS...THEN MAXES OCCUR IN THE MORNING PRIOR TO FRONTAL 
PASSAGE. STEADY OR FALLING TEMPS IN THE AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE RIDGING WILL 
BUILD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK. 
HOWEVER...AN UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL 
PULL MOISTURE/PRECIPITATION BACK INTO THE CAROLINAS/GEORGIA FOR 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING...BUT BOTH GFS/ECMWF SHOWS MOST 
OF THE MOISTURE/DYNAMICS STAYING EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT POPS FOR THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA...OTHERWISE DRY.

SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGING WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER OVER THE AREA 
FOR LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT KEEPING FOR THE FORECAST

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT NORTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA...GENERALLY STRETCHING 
ALONG A LINE FROM LEXINGTON TO NASHVILLE TO MEMPHIS. THIS COLD FRONT 
IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT TODAY...AS 
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS INCREASE AHEAD OF A DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
OVER THE PLAINS. MODELS INDICATE THAT MOST OF THE UPPER DYNAMICS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS TROUGH WILL BE OCCURRING WEST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY...WITH ONLY SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT POSSIBLY CREATING 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ALSO REVEAL SOME 
WEAK INSTABILITY DEVELOPING AROUND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS 
AFTERNOON...SO WILL MENTION THUNDER IN THESE AREAS. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...BRINGING WITH IT SOME VERY 
GOOD CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND SOME SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. THIS 
ACTIVITY WILL MOVE INTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/WESTERN ZONES LATE 
TONIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING AND OVERSPREAD THE AREA THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY...BEFORE GRADUALLY TAPERING OFF BY LATE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. 
WITH HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES IN PLACE AND A STRONG MEAN 
SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT MOVING PARALLEL TO THE BOUNDARY...THE POTENTIAL 
FOR TRAINING AND THUS LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE...AND 
WILL BE THE BIGGEST THREAT WITH THE ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP. 
INSTABILITY PARAMETERS STILL DO NOT APPEAR TO BE TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE 
DURING THIS TIME. HOWEVER...THERE WILL BE SOME MODEST ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY VALUES /PARTICULARLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/. 
THIS...COMBINED WITH STRONG JET DYNAMICS AND SUBSEQUENTLY HIGH 0-6 
KM SHEAR VALUES WILL ALLOW FOR DECENT STORM ORGANIZATION AND THUS A 
DAMAGING WIND THREAT WITH ANY STRONG/SEVERE STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP. 

AS MENTIONED...BY MONDAY NIGHT SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO TAPER OFF FROM 
WEST TO EAST...THOUGH STILL FEEL HIGH-END CHANCE POPS ARE WARRANTED 
OVER MUCH OF THE AREA /FAVORING THE NORTHEAST AND MOUNTAINS ZONES/. 
AS COLDER AIR WORKS ITS WAY INTO THE REGION IN WAKE OF THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE...A CHANGE OVER TO LIGHT SNOW IS EXPECTED IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS AFTER 06Z TUESDAY THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. WHILE  
SOME ACCUMULATIONS CANNOT BE RULED OUT ALONG THE PEAKS OF THE 
MOUNTAINS...VERY MINOR TO NO ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED TO BE THE RULE 
IN MOST OTHER LOWER ELEVATION AREAS. THEREAFTER...SUBTROPICAL 
RIDGING WILL PROMOTE DRY/CLEARER WEATHER THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 
THE WORK WEEK...BEFORE ANOTHER UPPER STORM SYSTEM APPROACHES THE 
AREA FROM THE WEST BRINGING SOME ADDITIONAL PRECIP CHA...HAVE OPTED 
TO INCREASE POPS TO CHANCE AREAWIDE BY SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CONVECTION TO OUR WEST
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...HAS CONTINUED TO WEAKEN AS IT FINALLY HAS
REACHED OUR NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES. TRIMMED POPS BACK A BIT ACROSS
SRN AREAS BUT KEPT A NARROW SWATH OF LIKELY POPS TONIGHT FOR NRN
PLATEAU INTO SW VA COUNTIES. BETTER IDEA TO GO SLIGHTLY ABOVE GFS
MOS MINS BASED ON TREND OF LATE.

FOR SUNDAY...HAD TO CUT POPS BACK QUITE A BIT AND ALSO DOWNPLAYED
THE CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS. LIFT SEEMS TO BE LACKING ON SUNDAY AS
THE APPROACHING FRONT TONIGHT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY LIFT NE AS A
WARM FRONT TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY MORNING. THE LOW LEVEL JET
AFTER 12Z SUNDAY IS OVER CENTRAL KENTUCKY...WITH ANY ELEVATED
INSTABILITY WELL OFF TO OUR NW SUNDAY MORNING. RAN SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS OVER SRN AREAS TO GOOD CHANCE OVER SWRN VA...WITH JUST SHOWERS
IN THE MORNING. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW SOME STEEPER LAPSE RATES BY
SUNDAY AFTERNOON...SO I CARRIED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS IN
THE AFTERNOON. TEMPS SHOULD EASILY REACH THE 60S TO LOWER 70S GIVEN
ANY BREAKS OF SUNSHINE...SO TRENDED TOWARD THE MILDER MAXES WHERE
ANY SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.

FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...MODELS WERE CONSISTENT AND PREVIOUS
GRIDS LOOKED GENERALLY ON TRACK...ALTHO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS COULD BE
SLOWED DOWN BY 1 TO 3 HOURS. STILL...I LIKED THE POP GRADIENT FOR
SUNDAY NIGHT FROM NW TO SE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...LEADING TO
CATEGORICAL POPS ON MONDAY. LIFT IS IMPRESSIVE WITH HEAVIEST RAINS
WE HAVE HAD IN QUITE SOMETIME WITH THIS FRONT. OTHERWISE...TEMPS
LOOK TO FALL MONDAY AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE...BUT MAX TEMPS EARLY
MONDAY WERE BUMPED UP CLOSER TO 8/12Z GUIDANCE AND NWS NEIGHBORS
GRIDS. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL BE 
MOVING EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MONDAY NIGHT BUT STILL 
A FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE REMAINS BEHIND THE FRONT ALONG WITH SOME 
UPPER LEVEL ENERGY SO KEPT POPS IN A LIKELY CATEGORY.  MOISTURE 
GRADUALLY EXITS ON TUESDAY BUT UPSLOPE COMPONENT STRONG AND KEPT 
SOME LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS WITH A FEW SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHEST 
TERRAIN GOING. THE FORECAST AREA DRIES OUT THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
REMAINDER OF THE WEEK AS UPPER RIDGING TAKES HOLD BY THURSDAY 
HELPING TEMPERATURES TO REBOUND BACK TO A NORMAL RANGE FOR EARLY 
DECEMBER. AN AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES TOWARD THE WEEKEND 
AND THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT BUILDS THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
ON SATURDAY. MODELS SHOW QUITE A MOIST CONVEYOR DEVELOPING AND WOULD 
EXPECT SOME SHOWER TO DEVELOP WELL AHEAD OF THE FRONT SO INCLUDED A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT.

.DISCUSSION...CONVECTION CONTINUES AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT THIS 
MORNING ALONG A JACKSON TO NASHVILLE TO LEXINGTON LINE. MODIFIED 12Z 
OHX SOUNDING SHOWED SLIGHT INSTABILITY WITH AROUND 600 J/KG CAPE. 
MOISTURE REMAINS VERY HIGH ACROSS THE REGION WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES ABOUT 1.5 TO 1.8 TIMES ABOVE NORMAL...BUT LACK OF LIFT AND 
THE WARM AIR ALOFT AROUND 700 MBS SHOULD BE LIMITING FACTORS.  

FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK THIS MORNING WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS A GOOD 
BET THIS AFTERNOON. THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE MORE ISOLATED IN COVERAGE 
EXCEPT FOR OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES. HOURLY TEMPS AND DEW POINT TEMPS 
RUNNING VERY CLOSE TO FORECAST GRIDS AT THIS POINT.

AN UPDATE TO FORECAST GRIDS AND PRODUCTS MAY NOT BE NEEDED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE GEORGIA/SOUTH CAROLINA 
STATE LINE...WITH A COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACHING THE LOWER OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO ONLY SLOWLY DRIFT 
EASTWARD TODAY...BECOMING LOCATED AROUND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY 
THIS EVENING. A DEEP AND MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA INTO TONIGHT...WITH WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT RESULTING 
IN MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES. GFS AND NAM MODELS AGREE THAT SOME MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...SO 
WILL MENTION SCATTERED CONVECTION WITH THE BEST COVERAGE EXPECTED 
OVER THE NORTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA CLOSER TO THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ACTIVE WEATHER IN THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD AS A WARM/STATIONARY FRONT WILL REMAINED DRAPED IN THE 
VICINITY OF THE FORECAST AREA ALONG THE TENNESSEE/KENTUCKY BORDER ON 
SUNDAY. THIS BOUNDARY WILL SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT THE DAY...WITH THE MOST FAVORED 
AREAS BEING IN THE NORTHERN ZONES /CLOSEST TO THE FRONT/. SOME 
STORMS WILL HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME STRONG GIVEN SOME ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY ALOFT AND WILL CONTINUE TO HAVE A MENTION OF THIS IN THE 
HWO. 

WITH UPPER-RIDGING ONGOING TO THE NORTHEAST AND A DEEPENING UPPER- 
TROUGH AND STRONG COLD FRONT TO THE WEST...A MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW 
FROM THE GULF WILL PERSIST THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON SUNDAY. THIS MOIST 
ENVIRONMENT WILL SET THE STAGE FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AS THE 
AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS 
ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING OF THE HEAVY 
PRECIPITATION...SHOWING IT APPROACHING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BTWN 
06-12Z ON MONDAY AND THEN GRADUALLY MOVING EAST THROUGH THE AREA 
MONDAY AND MONDAY EVENING...BEFORE TAPERING OFF FROM WEST TO EAST 
LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. GIVEN THIS...HAVE GONE LIKELY POPS 
IN MOST AREAS BTWN 06-12Z MONDAY AND THEN CATEGORICAL AREAWIDE 
DURING THE DAY TO REFLECT THIS POTENTIAL. WITH UNSEASONABLY HIGH 
PWAT VALUES AND A STOUT MEAN SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT MOVING PARALLEL TO 
THE BOUNDARY...THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAINING/LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IS 
EXPECTED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS FRONTAL SYSTEM. ALSO...WHILE SOME 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY WILL EXIST IT IS PROGGED TO BE SOMEWHAT 
LIMITED. STILL...THE STRONG JET DYNAMICS COMBINED WITH THIS MODEST 
INSTABILITY WILL ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW ISOLATED STRONG 
STORMS ONCE AGAIN. 

AS MENTIONED...POPS WILL BEGIN TO GRADUALLY TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO 
EAST LATE MONDAY...THOUGH HIGH-END CHANCE POPS ARE STILL WARRANTED 
AREAWIDE THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY...WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES FAVORING 
THE MOUNTAINS/NORTHEAST ZONES. AS COLDER AIR FILTERS INTO THE REGION 
IN WAKE OF THE FRONT THE POTENTIAL FOR A CHANGE OVER TO LIGHT SNOW 
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR. WHILE SOME 
ACCUMULATIONS CANNOT BE RULED OUT ALONG THE PEAKS OF THE 
MOUNTAINS...VERY MINOR TO NO ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED TO BE THE RULE 
IN MOST OTHER LOWER ELEVATION AREAS. BEHIND THIS STORM SYSTEM 
ANOTHER SERIES OF TROUGHS ARE PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE END OF WEEK. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE LACK OF 
MOISTURE HAVE KEPT MENTIONABLE POPS OUT INITIALLY FOR THURSDAY... 
WITH LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY AS MOISTURE SLOWLY 
RETURNS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...LOW CLOUDS FINALLY LIFTING AND 
BREAKING UP ACROSS THE SRN VALLEY AREAS...WITH MOST OTHER AREAS 
EXPERIENCING BRIEF PERIODS OF SUNSHINE. REALLY NO FORCING FOR LIFT 
THIS AFTERNOON...THUS RADARS HAVE REMAINED ECHO FREE. STILL A NICE 
DAY FOR EARLY DECEMBER WITH HIGHS EASILY REACHING THE MID 50S TO MID 
60S...ABOUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS.

MODELS DEVELOP BROAD WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT OVERNIGHT...WITH CLOUDS 
EXPECTED TO FILL IN AND LOWER. WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
MAINLY PATCHY LIGHT RAIN OR SPRINKLES. CLOUDINESS FAVORS AT OR JUST 
ABOVE THE GFS MOS MINS.

FOR SATURDAY...NO MAJOR CHANGES MADE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS...EXCEPT TO 
LOWER POPS IN THE MORNING AND TO RAISE POPS IN THE FAR NWRN AREAS TO 
LOW END OF LIKELY IN THE AFTERNOON. THREAT OF THUNDERSTORMS LOOKS TO 
BE MAINLY CONFINED TO THE PLATEAU COUNTIES...WHERE ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY IS NOTED IN THE AFTERNOON. MOS MAX TEMPS ARE REACHABLE
BUT CHA MAY STRUGGLE TO REACH THE GFS 68 MAX...SIMILAR TO THIS 
AFTERNOON. 


.LONG TERM...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PERIOD...WE ARE IN A DEEP SWLY FLOW BETWEEN THE UPPER 
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVER CUBA AND THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL 
U.S. AND CANADA.  A RELATIVELY WARM/MOIST AIR MASS WILL CONTINUE 
OVER THE AREA AS WELL...AS A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY STAYS TO OUR 
NORTH EARLY-ON.  AS WE HEAD DEEPER INTO THE FORECAST...THE UPPER 
TROUGH HEADS OUR WAY...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED FRONT TO PASS THRU ABOUT 
MONDAY.  HOWEVER...THE UPPER TROUGH KEEPS HOLD OF THE AREA THROUGH 
MID WEEK AND DOESN'T LOOK TO PASS UNTIL AROUND WEDNESDAY.  MOS KEEPS 
POPS OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE REST OF THESE DAYS...BUT IT LOOKS 
LIKE MOST OF THE MOISTURE WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA.  A SIGNIFICANT 
PATCH OF ELEVATED Q-CONVERGENCE AND LIFT COME OVER THE AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY...BUT THE AIR MASS LOOKS TOO DRY TO PRODUCE ANY PRECIP.  
GOING DRY IN THE FORECAST AFTER TUESDAY NIGHT...EXCEPT FOR SOME POPS 
AT THE END OF THE FORECAST AS THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVES IN FROM THE WEST.

FOR WINTER PRECIP...MIGHT BE A LITTLE SNOWFALL IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH 
THE POST-FRONTAL UPSLOPE FLOW MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...BUT 
MOISTURE IS PRETTY SHALLOW AND IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THERE WILL BE 
ANY POST-FRONTAL NORTHWEST FLOW INSTABILITY WITH THIS SYSTEM...SO 
NOT PUTTING ANY MEASURABLE SNOW IN THE GRIDS IN THOSE MOUNTAIN AREAS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...ACTIVE WEATHER IN THE

PRECIPITATION THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK. INITIALLY ON 
SATURDAY...A MOIST/SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN IN PLACE 
WITH RIDGING TO THE NORTHEAST AND AN UPPER-TROUGH AND COLD FRONT TO 
THE WEST. SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT IS PROGGED TO INCREASE AHEAD OF THIS

LOCATIONS THROUGH SUNDAY...WITH THE MOST FAVORED AREAS BEING ACROSS 
THE NORTHWEST/FAR NORTHERN ZONES WHICH WILL BE CLOSEST TO THE

SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...A STRONG UPPER-TROUGH STRETCHING FROM

APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA AND BRING WITH IT A STRONG COLD FRONT 
WHICH WILL SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWERS THROUGH THE 
BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. BOTH THE GFS/NAM SHOW THE FRONT AND 
ASSOCIATED PRECIP WORKING ITS WAY INTO CUMBERLAND PLATEAU LATE 
SUNDAY NIGHT...SO HAVE GONE CHANCE TO LIKELY AREAWIDE DURING THIS

MONDAY. THUS HAVE GONE WITH CATEGORICAL POPS AREAWIDE ON MONDAY. 
THEN HAVE TAPERED THINGS OFF FROM WEST TO EAST MONDAY NIGHT...THOUGH 
SOME LINGERING LIGHT PRECIP IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND

LOTS OF CLOUD COVER LINGERS...WHICH FAVORS AT OR ABOVE THE MILDER
MOS MINS...WHILE MAX TEMPS SHOULD STRUGGLE TO REACH THE HIGHER MOS
MAXES. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL PATTERN 
WILL BE IN THE PROCESS OF AMPLIFYING SATURDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS A 
DEEP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH BUILDS SOUTHEAST FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS SHOULD HELP TO PUSH A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY NORTH OF THE OHIO VALLEY. MUCH OF 
THE LIFT SHOULD MOVE NORTH WITH THIS WARMER FRONTAL PUSH KEEPING THE 
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS RATHER LOW OR NON-EXISTENT SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY. LEFT SOME SLIGHT CHANCE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU POPS GOING HERE 
BUT THE AREA SHOULD BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A WARM SECTOR AIRMASS 
WHILE A STRONG MID LATITUDE CYCLONE AND COLD FRONT MAKE THEIR WAY 
INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY 12Z MONDAY. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY AND ADJUSTED POPS TO CATEGORICAL 
FOR THE WHOLE REGION. STRONG SHEAR WITH JUST ADEQUATE INSTABILITY 
SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY SO KEPT THIS IDEA IN PLACE. NICE...STRONG UPPER TROUGH 
LOOKS LIKE IT MAY HAVE A TRAILING SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURE AND 
ASSOCIATED MOISTURE TO FILL IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING FRONT. THIS 
SCENARIO REQUIRES A SLOW DROP IN POP FOR MONDAY NIGHT WITH LINGERING 
SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITIES IN THE TERRAIN AREAS OF SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE INTO TUESDAY. WINTER TIME COLD AIR 
ADVECTION SHOULD ALLOW FOR A MIXTURE WITH OR CHANGEOVER TO SNOW IN 
THESE HIGH TERRAIN AREAS AND POSSIBLY VALLEY LOCALES BEFORE THE 
PRECIP ENDS. ANOTHER SHORT WAVE BUILDS ACROSS AT MID WEEK BUT HAS 
LITTLE AVAILABLE MOISTURE. PERHAPS THE NEXT LOOK AT RAIN MAY WAIT 
UNTIL FRIDAY OR SATURDAY AS ISENTROPIC LIFT STRENGTHENS IN 
INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. TRENDED TEMPERATURE FORECAST TO 
WITHIN A FEW DEGREES OF MEX MOS.

.AVIATION...THE PATTERN DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS SHOWS MORE ACTIVE
WEATHER (PRECIP) FARTHER NORTH ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. HOWEVER THE
MOIST SOUTH TO SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL KEEP QUITE A FEW CLOUDS IN
PLACE ACROSS THE TERMINALS. THE LOWER LAYER SHOULD STAY ABOVE
3500-4000 FEET ACROSS MOST OF THE GREAT VALLEY OF EAST
TENNESSEE...BUT MAY DROP TO AROUND 3000 FEET AT CHA LATER TONIGHT.
THEREFORE...FLIGHT WEATHER WILL BE VFR THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD
AT ALL THE TERMINALS BUT COULD DROP TO THE TOP END OF MVFR RANGE AT
CHA FOR A NUMBER OF HOURS LATE IN THE FORECAST. PROBABILITY OF

AREA LATE WEDNESDAY AND OVERNIGHT WITH A DRIER AIRMASS AND A NE WIND 
TO DROP TEMPERATURES INTO THE UPPER 20S AND 30S NE. LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE WAS INCREASING FROM THE SOUTH EARLY THIS MORNING WITH

LOW LEVEL TROUGH WAS SETTING UP ACROSS THE EASTERN TN VALLEY. A FEW 
SHOWERS WERE MOVING NE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU...SOUTHERN VALLEY 
AND SOUTHEAST MOUNTAINS INCLUDING SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THE WEAK 
SURFACE TROUGH WILL LINGER OVER THE AREA TODAY ENHANCING LIFT FOR A 
FEW SHOWERS TODAY AND TONIGHT. HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE PLATEAU...

UNITED STATES. WARM TEMPERATURES AND VARIABLE CLOUDY CONDITIONS 
DEPICTED THROUGH SUNDAY. WENT BELOW MOS POPS THROUGH SUNDAY DUE TO 
LACK OF FOCUSING MECHANISM ACROSS MRX CWA. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
A GOOD BET. ONGOING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LIKELY ACCOMPANY

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT 12-24 HOURS AS AN
UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM DRAGS A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE LOWER-
MISSISSIPPI/TENNESSEE VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...SOME BREEZY SW WINDS
AND HEATING HAS ALLOWED HIGHS TO ONCE AGAIN CLIMB INTO THE UPPER
60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES IN MANY LOCATIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA...ABOUT 15-20 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.
HOWEVER...SOME DENSE CLOUD COVER AHEAD OF THIS STORM SYSTEM HAVE
BEGUN TO OVERSPREAD THE REGION AND RADAR IS SHOWING SOME SCATTERED
LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS MOVING INTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. SOME
HEAVIER ACTIVITY TO THE WEST ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE IS PROGGED TO
GRADUALLY MOVE EASTWARD IN THE AREA OVERNIGHT. MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY
GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING OF THE FRONT AND ASSOCIATED
PRECIPITATION...PUSHING THE HEAVIEST QPF SIGNALS ACROSS THE AREA
OVERNIGHT /ROUGHLY BTWN 03-12Z/ AND THE GRADUALLY TAPERING THINGS
OFF ON WEDNESDAY FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST. AS A RESULT...HAVE
LIKELY POPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA /WITH DEFINITIVE POPS IN THE
NORTHWEST ZONES/ THIS EVENING...BEFORE INCREASING THEM TO DEFINITE
AREAWIDE AFTER 04Z OR SO. GIVEN THAT THE FORECAST MAY SLOW/STALL
NEAR THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES TOMORROW...HAVE MAINTAINED CHANCE TO
LIKELY POPS ACROSS THIS AREA THROUGH 00Z THURSDAY. SOME COOLER
TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED FOR TOMORROW AS WELL...BUT THERE IS
NOT A SIGNIFICANT PUSH OF COOLER AIR IN WAKE OF THE FRONT. IN
FACT...HIGHS SHOULD STILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL IN THE UPPER
50S/LOWER 60S.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
THE FRONT WILL STALL JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE
MOVEMENT OF THE 850 MB RIDGE TO THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST WILL BRING A
SE FETCH AND WEAK LIFT OVER THE FRONT. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE
POP IN SW NC/SE TN WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SHALLOW MOISTURE AND A
NORTHWARD-DRIFTING WARM FRONT WILL PROVIDE CLOUDS ON THURSDAY...BUT
CHANCES OF MEASURABLE PRECIP LOOK SLIM AS MIDLEVELS STAY DRY.

A SPLIT FLOW PATTERN DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS...WITH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FIRMLY UNDER THE SOUTHERN STREAM. THIS 
WILL RESULT IN A MILD PERIOD THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH LOW PRECIP 
CHANCES EACH PERIOD. MODELS TYPICALLY HAVE A HARD TIME WITH SUCH A 
PATTERN...SO FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS LOW. WEAK UPPER VORT MAXES AND 
JET STREAKS MOVING OVER A MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW COULD PRODUCE LIGHT 
RAIN SHOWERS ANY TIME FROM FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. WITH NO STRONG 
FORCING MECHANISM TO LATCH ONTO...WILL CARRY SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE 
POPS. NORTHWESTERN SECTION MAY HAVE THE BEST CHANCES CLOSER TO A 
STATIONARY FRONT NEAR THE OHIO VALLEY. A MERGER OF NORTHERN AND 
SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGHS OCCURS MONDAY OVER THE PLAINS...PUSHING THE 
OH VALLEY FRONT TOWARD OUR AREA. PRECIP CHANCES LOOK TO INCREASE 
MONDAY...BUT STILL IN THE CHANCE RANGE. DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS 
AND ECMWF AND LARGE ENSEMBLE SPREADS LEAD TO A LOW CONFIDENCE 
FORECAST.

A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN IS COMING TO THE REGION AS AN UPPER-STORM
SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO DRAG A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE LOWER-
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON.
AS A RESULT...CLOUD COVER AND MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE...
ALONG WITH THE CHANCE FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON
RADAR IMAGERY AS OF 10 AM EST ALREADY SHOWS SEVERAL BANDS OF LIGHT
TO MODERATE SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH MIDDLE TENNESSEE TOWARD THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. AS A RESULT...FELT THAT IT WAS WARRANTED TO ADD
A MENTION FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN THE WESTERN ZONES PRIOR
TO 18Z. SOME BETTER CHANCES FOR SHOWERS WILL EXIST THIS AFTERNOON
AS LIFT/MOISTURE INCREASES AND THESE SHOWERS WORK THEIR WAY INTO
THE AREA. AS SUCH...HAVE INCREASED POPS IN AREAS ALONG AND
KNOXVILLE TO CHANCE AFTER 18Z AND THE FAR WESTERN ZONES TO LIKELY
AFTER 21Z. GIVEN SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY...CANNOT RULE OUT A FEW
ISOLATED STORMS DEVELOPING WITH THESE SHOWERS LATE THIS AFTERNOON
/GENERALLY WEST OF THE I-75 CORRIDOR/ AND HAVE ADDED THIS TO THE
FORECAST. ALSO...THOUGH SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL HELP TO PROMOTE VERY
MILD TEMPERATURES ONCE AGAIN...THE DENSE CLOUD COVER WILL HELP
LIMIT HEATING SOMEWHAT...SO HAVE LOWERED HIGHS /PARTICULARLY ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN ZONES/ TO GENERALLY THE MID TO UPPER 60S.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
A VERY UNSEASONABLY WARM EARLY DECEMBER DAY IS OCCURRING ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON AS TEMPERATURES HAVE RISEN INTO
THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. SOME
LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WILL LIKELY REACH THE MID 70S
BEFORE HEATING CEASES LATER THIS EVENING. THE WARM/DRY CONDITIONS
ARE THE RESULT OF A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CENTERED TO THE SOUTHEAST OF
THE REGION...WHICH HAS ALLOWED FOR MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND A
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. HOWEVER...A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN WILL OCCUR BY
TOMORROW AS AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM PASSING THROUGH THE
NORTHERN GREAT LAKES WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT FROM THE LOWER-
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE REGION DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING.
THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME INCREASED CLOUD COVER TONIGHT INTO
TUESDAY AS THE FRONT APPROACHES ALONG WITH SOME DECENT RAIN CHANCES
BEGINNING TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

MODELS ARE STILL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THE FRONT AND
PRECIP...SHOWING THE BULK OF IT MOVING IN AFTER 00Z WEDNESDAY.
HOWEVER...SOME SHOWERS MAY BEGIN TO WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AFTER 18Z TOMORROW BASED ON THE LATEST MODEL
TRENDS. THUS...CERTAINLY FELT LIKE SOLID CHANCE POPS WERE
WARRANTED ALONG AND WEST OF THE I-75 CORRIDOR. ADDITIONALLY...SOME
ELEVATED INSTABILITY MAY RESULT IN SOME ISOLATED/SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS OCCURRING WITH THE SHOWERS...SO HAVE INCLUDED A
MENTION OF THEM IN THE WESTERN ZONES AS WELL. WITH BREEZY SOUTHWEST
WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT...HIGHS TOMORROW WILL STILL BE WELL ABOVE
NORMAL...BUT LIKELY A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY GIVEN THE
DENSER CLOUD COVER. LOWS TONIGHT WILL ALSO BE MILD...BOTTOMING OUT
IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S ONCE AGAIN.


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
NAM AND GFS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF AN APPROACHING 
COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH...WITH THE BULK OF THE PRECIP CROSSING 
OUR AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. CATEGORICAL POPS WILL ENTER THE PLATEAU 
COUNTIES BETWEEN 00-04Z...PEAKING 04-08Z...THEN DECREASING FROM WEST 
TO EAST 08-12Z. THE FRONT LAGS THE UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE A BIT...AND 
SO WILL KEEP SOME CHANCE POPS INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING SOUTHEAST. COLD 
ADVECTION IS NOT VERY STRONG BEHIND THE FRONT...AND HIGH TEMPS WILL 
REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL FOR WEDNESDAY WITH CLEARING SKIES THROUGH THE 
DAY.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL DRIFT EASTWARD ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY/GREAT LAKES 
REGION ON WEDNESDAY...BECOMING POSITIONED OVER THE MID-ATLANTIC 
REGION THURSDAY. WE WILL SEE A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WITH A 
NEARLY ZONAL MID-UPPER LEVEL FLOW THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. MODELS 
TYPICALLY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME PICKING OUT THE SMALL SHORTAVES AND 
JET STREAKS IN THIS TYPE OF PATTERN...AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE 
ENSEMBLE SPREAD THIS PERIOD. FORCING IN THE MODELS IS WEAK...TIED 
MAINLY TO A SERIES OF UPPER JET STREAKS. CONFIDENCE IS LOW...SO ONLY 
MINOR CHANGES WILL BE MADE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST OF LOW TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. A MORE AMPLIFIED PATTERN DEVELOPS 
ON MONDAY...HOWEVER THE ECMWF AND GFS HAVE BIG TIMING DIFFERENCES 
WITH THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS. WILL BRING MONDAY IN DRY AND 
MILD.

WAKE OF THE FRONT...WITH HIGHS DROPPING BACK INTO THE 50S TO AROUND
60 IN A FEW SPOTS.

THEREAFTER...ZONAL FLOW ALOFT RETURNS FOR THURSDAY BEFORE ANOTHER 
SERIES OF UPPER-WAVES APPROACH THE REGION FROM THE WEST...BRINGING 
WITH THEM SOME ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR SHOWERS LATE FRIDAY INTO THE 
WEEKEND. GIVEN SOME MODEL UNCERTAINTIES THAT FAR OUT HAVE BEEN 
CAUTIOUS ABOUT INCREASING POPS TOO MUCH ON SATURDAY...BUT CERTAINLY 
FEEL CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE SEEMS REASONABLE ATTM...WITH SLIGHT 
CHANCES POPS ON SUNDAY AS WELL.

CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST...WHICH EXTENDED SOUTHWESTWARD OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TN RIVER VALLEY. CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGERY 
REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE TN AND OHIO RIVER VALLEYS... 
OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. THIS 
SHORT WAVE SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRODUCE PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH MILD DEWPOINTS THIS EVENING ALLOWING 
FOR SOME PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS SUNRISE...ESPECIALLY NEAR 
BODIES OF WATER AND IN LOW LYING AREAS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...WEAK UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA 
SHIFTS EAST...AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS CENTERED TO OUR EAST 
DURING THE SHORT TERM.  STRATO CU REDEVELOPMENT LOOKS MOST LIKELY IN 
OUR NC ZONES TONIGHT...SO WILL GO WITH MORE CLOUDS THERE THAN 
ELSEWHERE.  SHOULD BE WARM WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AGAIN ON SUNDAY.  
WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SUBTROPICAL RIDGING
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO
PROMOTE WARM/DRY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE REGION ON MONDAY AS HIGH
TEMPERATURES SHOULD REACH THE MID/UPPER 60S TO EVEN THE LOWER 70S
IN SOME LOCATIONS. HOWEVER...A WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL PASS THROUGH THE
OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT AND MODELS HAVE SHOWN A FEW LIGHT QPF
SIGNALS JUST TO THE NORTH OF OUR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA COUNTIES.
HOWEVER...GIVEN THE LACK OF MOISTURE...DID NOT FEEL CONFIDENT
ENOUGH TO INTRODUCE MENTIONABLE POPS AND FEEL THAT LOW/MID CLOUDS
OVER THAT AREA WILL BE THE PRIMARY RESULT.

HEADING INTO TUESDAY...A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN WILL OCCUR AS A STORM 
SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE REGION LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO WEDNESDAY. MODELS 
HAVE TRENDED A LITTLE LATER IN THE TIMING OF THE FRONT...THOUGH THE 
NAM/GFS SOLUTIONS ARE STILL A BIT FASTER THAN THE ECMWF. SO... 
TUESDAY MAY BE A BIT WARMER/DRIER THAN INITIALLY EXPECTED WITH HIGHS 
IN THE 60S ONCE AGAIN BEFORE THE FRONT MOVES IN BY THE LATE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HAVE HIGHLIGHTED THIS IN THE FORECAST AND 
HAVE KEPT MENTIONABLE POPS OUT UNTIL TUESDAY AFTERNOON /GOING CHANCE 
IN THE WEST...BUT LEAVING THE FAR EASTERN ZONES DRY/. THEN HAVE GONE 
HIGH END CHANCE TO LIKELY TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH...BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF SIGNIFICANTLY FROM WEST TO EAST 
ON WEDNESDAY. THEREAFTER...ZONAL FLOW AND SLIGHTLY MILDER AND DRY 
WEATHER IS EXPECTED FOR THURSDAY BEFORE THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM IS 
PROGGED TO APPROACH THE AREA LATE FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. GIVEN 
THAT BOTH MODELS HAVE HINTED AT THIS FOR THE PAST COUPLE OF 
DAYS...HAVE GONE AHEAD AND INTRODUCED CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...WEAK MOISTURE RETURN IN THE

CLOUDS LATE LAST NIGHT INTO TODAY OVER SOUTHERN HALF...BUT THESE ARE 
MIXING OUT THIS AFTERNOON.  MAY SEE A REPEAT TONIGHT WITH EXTENT 
FARTHER NORTH...SO WILL SHOW SIMILAR PATTERN FOR THE SHORT TERM SKY

TREND CONTINUING.  MAV TEMPS HAVE GENERALLY BEEN GOOD OF LATE AND 
LOOK GOOD ONCE AGAIN...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.    

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... CONTINUED QUIET
WEATHER IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH MONDAY AS THE
REGION WILL REMAIN ON THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE
SITUATED OVER THE CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO. A WEAK WAVE WILL PASS
ALONG THE TOP OF THIS RIDGE SUNDAY NIGHT...AND THE NAM SHOWS IT
TRIGGERING OFF A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS EASTERN KENTUCKY/NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF SW VIRGINIA. GIVEN THAT THIS IS THE FIRST TIME THIS HAS
SHOWN UP AND THE GFS IS STILL MUCH DRIER...HAVE OPTED TO KEEP
MENTIONABLE POPS OUT OF THE FORECAST THERE FOR NOW...THOUGH HAVE
INCREASED CLOUD COVER A BIT OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER... THE MAIN STORY
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK WILL BE CONTINUED WARM CONDITIONS AS THE
PARTLY SUNNY SKIES AND SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL HELP TO PUSH HIGHS INTO
THE MID TO UPPER 60S /WITH A FEW SPOTS ACROSS SE TENNESSEE REACHING
70 DEGREES/.

THE BOUT OF WARMER AND DRIER WEATHER WILL COME TO AN END BY THE 
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK AS MOISTURE WILL INCREASE AHEAD OF AN 
UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM PASSING THROUGH THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES. 
THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE FROM THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SOMETIME TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY...BRINGING THE REGION ITS BEST SHOT FOR RAINFALL IN OVER A 
WEEK. THERE CONTINUES TO BE DISAGREEMENT AMONG THE MODELS REGARDING 
THE EXACT TIMING OF THE FRONT/PRECIP...THOUGH CONFIDENCE IS FAIRLY 
HIGH THAT SHOWERS WILL OCCUR DURING THIS TIMEFRAME. THE GFS IS STILL 
FASTER...MOVING THE PRECIP IN TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND HAVING IT EXIT THE 
AREA BY WEDNESDAY MORNING...WHILE THE ECMWF INDICATES IT WILL MOVE 
IN TUESDAY NIGHT AND EXIT THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY EVENING. GIVEN 
THESE DIFFERENCES...HAVE TRIED NOT TO GET TOO SPECIFIC WITH THE  
TIMING JUST YET. STILL...FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO HIGH-END CHANCE 
ACROSS THE WESTERN ZONES TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND THEN HIGH-END CHANCE 
TO LIKELY TUESDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA...BEFORE GRADUALLY 
TAPERING THINGS OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ON WEDNESDAY. THEREAFTER... 
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT PREVAILS TO CLOSE OUT THE WORK WEEK BEFORE ANOTHER 
STORM SYSTEM/FRONT TRACKS EAST AND POTENTIALLY BRINGS MORE SHOWERS 
TO THE AREA FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

REMAIN DRY THROUGH THE PERIOD. LOW LEVEL RIDGING CONTINUES EAST OF 
THE APPALACHIANS EXTENDING TO THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO COAST.
GOOD RETURN FLOW TAKING SHAPE TODAY. LOW CLOUDS GATHERING OVER AL 
AND GA THIS MORNING. THIS MOISTURE WILL TRANSPORT UP THE E TN VALLEY 
TODAY. MODEST WARM AIR ADVECTION WILL ALSO OCCUR. TEMPERATURES WILL 
RISE TO A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...DIRTY RIDGE IN PLACE ON 
SATURDAY WITH FLOW ALOFT BECOMING ZONAL ON SUNDAY AND RETURNING TO 
WEAK RIDGING MONDAY.  THIS WILL TRANSLATE TO DRY AND WARM CONDITIONS 
FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE EXTENDED.  MAIN CONCERN THROUGH THE PERIOD 
WILL BE A COLD FRONT MOVING IN AROUND TUESDAY.  MODELS STILL SHOWING 
TIMING DIFFERENCES BUT GENERALLY ON TRACK WITH OVERALL PATTERN.  
BASICALLY LOOKING AT FRONTAL PASSAGE AND ASSOCIATED BAND OF SHOWERS 
LATE TUESDAY IN TUESDAY NIGHT.  WITH A WARM TEMPERATURE 
PROFILE...SHOULD BE AN ALL RAIN EVENT.  A FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER 
INTO WEDNESDAY AS THE SYSTEM EXITS FOR WEST TO EAST.  SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...AN AREA OF SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE TO OUR EAST WILL CONTINUE TO EXTEND INTO THE AREA.  LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE WILL START TO RETURN LATER TONIGHT AROUND THIS 
HIGH...WHICH MAY BRING SOME LOWER CLOUDS MAINLY SOUTH LATE TONIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY.  OTHERWISE JUST SOME HIGH CLOUDS DRIFTING ACROSS THE 
AREA. CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH FOR LOW CLOUDS SOUTH TO IMPACT 
FORECAST TOO MUCH AT THIS POINT...SO WILL KEEP THINGS PRIMARILY 
MOSTLY CLEAR/SUNNY FOR NOW.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... THINGS LOOK TO BE
FAIRLY QUIET HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND AS A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AXIS
PUSHES INTO THE AREA...PROMOTING DRY CONDITIONS FOR THE NEXT
SEVERAL DAYS. WITH CLEAR SKIES...A PREVAILING SOUTHWEST FLOW AND
INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPS ALOFT...HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL
WARM BACK INTO THE MID TO UPPER 60S IN MANY SPOTS...AND POTENTIALLY
REACH/EXCEED 70 DEGREES ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE SUNDAY AND
MONDAY. THE MILD AND DRY WEATHER WILL EVENTUALLY COME TO AN END
HEADING INTO THE MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM
PASSING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES WILL DRIVE A COLD FRONT
THOUGH THE AREA. THIS WILL GIVE THE REGION IT'S FIRST REAL SHOT OF
PRECIPITATION IN OVER A WEEK'S TIME. ATTM...THERE IS STILL SOME
DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MODELS AS THE GFS SHOWS THE FRONT AND
ASSOCIATED PRECIP MOVING IN AFTER 12Z TUESDAY AND EXITING THE
REGION BY EARLY WEDNESDAY. THE ECMWF IS SOMEWHAT SLOWER...MOVING
THE PRECIP IN TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EXITING IT LATER IN THE DAY ON
WEDNESDAY. HAVE INCREASED POPS DURING THE TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING
TIMEFRAME TO HIGH-END CHANCE...BUT HAVE STILL ALLOWED FOR SOME
MODEL FLUCTUATIONS ON WEDNESDAY AND HAVE NOT GONE AS HIGH WITH POPS
THEN. AFTERWORDS...COOLER CONDITIONS AND FAIR/DRY WEATHER ARE
EXPECTED HEADING INTO THE LATTER PART OF NEXT WEEK.

WILL BE EXTREMELY LIMITED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A FEW CIRRUS CLOUDS. 
STAYED CLOSE TO SUGGESTED MOS MAX/MIN TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...NOT MANY CHANGES ARE NEEDED

HIGH CLOUDS. A LIGHT SW FLOW ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIDGE WILL 
PROVIDE ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES EACH DAY. 

A MORE AMPLIFIED MID/UPPER LEVEL PATTERN DEVELOPS OVER THE REGION ON 
TUESDAY. A TROUGH CROSSES THE GREAT LAKES REGION ON TUESDAY...WITH A 
TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH OUR AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TYPICAL SCENARIO FOR THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH A FRONTAL SYSTEM WELL SOUTHEAST OF THE REGION WITH 
NORTHERLY FLOW ALOFT AND LOW CLOUDS TRAPPED UNDER AN INVERSION 
AROUND 925 MB. APPEARS THE FORECAST HINGES ON THE THINNING CLOUD 
LAYER (ALREADY SEEING THE HIGH TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER PEAKING THROUGH THE STRATUS). SEEMS LIKE THE RUC13 HAS THE 
BEST HANDLE ON THE SITUATION WITH LAYER HANGING IN THERE A WHILE 
LONGER THAN OTHER MODELS INDICATE...ALTHOUGH THE GFS ISN'T AS BAD AS 
THE WRF PROGNOSTICATION ABILITIES. IT'S ALWAYS INTERESTING BECAUSE 
WHEN THIS ASPECT IS INCORRECT...TEMPERATURES ARE WAY OFF. THE MODELS 
HAD WHAT LITTLE HEAT THE AREA PICKED UP ON TUESDAY HAPPILY RADIATING 
AWAY UNDER CLEARING OVERNIGHT SKIES. MODEL SUGGESTIONS INDICATE 
TEMPS SHOULD BE SEVERAL DEGREES COOLER TOWARD DAYBREAK ALONG WITH 
SOME SATURATED SURFACE CONDITIONS IN SPOTS. WENT AHEAD AND STAYED 
WITH A PESSIMISTIC CLEARING TREND CLOSE TO THE RUC13 IDEA WITH 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA CLEARING EARLY IN 
THE DAY WITH CLOUDS HANGING AROUND LONGER ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. BECAUSE TEMPERATURES LOOK LIKE THEY WILL 
START OUT WARMER THAN THEY WERE SUPPOSED TO...STAYED CLOSE TO THE 
MOS MAX TEMP BLEND. WOULD EXPECT HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR TO TAKE 
OVER FOR TONIGHT ALLOWING RADIATION AND LOW TEMPERATURES MAINLY IN 
THE 20S. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY 
WILL FEATURE A LOW LEVEL RIDGE OFF THE GA/SC COAST...WITH A NEARLY 
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. THIS WILL KEEP THE AREA DRY AND MILD EACH DAY. A 
WEAK MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSES TO OUR NORTH ON SUNDAY/SUNDAY 
NIGHT. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN NORTHERN SECTIONS LOOKS QUITE GENEROUS 
AS MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED...BUT WILL BE KEPT IN THE FORECAST. THE 
MID-UPPER LEVEL FLOW AMPLIFIES ON MONDAY AS A DEEP TROUGH MOVES INTO 
THE PLAINS. WITH A DEEP SW FLOW...TEMPS WILL RISE WELL ABOVE NORMAL 
FOR MONDAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH TIMING OF PRECIP WITH 
THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT...AND WILL ADD CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
INCREASED POPS SIGNIFICANTLY THIS EVENING ACROSS MUCH OF THE
FORECAST AREA...PARTICULARLY IN THE FAR NORTHEASTERN ZONES. THIS
WAS DONE TO ACCOUNT FOR LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS MOVING IN A
LITTLE EARLIER THAN EXPECTED AS A SURFACE LOW AND ITS ASSOCIATED
COLD FRONT CONTINUE TO TRACK EASTWARD TOWARD THE REGION FROM MIDDLE
TENNESSEE. THESE SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD THE
REGION OVERNIGHT INTO TOMORROW MORNING...GIVING THE ENTIRE AREA A
SHOT OF MEASURABLE RAINFALL...UP TO 1/10 TO 1/4 OF AN INCH IN MANY
LOCATIONS. AS A RESULT...HAVE BUMPED POPS UP TO CHANCE AREAWIDE
THIS EVENING AND DEFINITE AFTER 06Z WHEN THE BETTER MOISTURE/LIFT
WILL BE PRESENT ACROSS THE REGION. HAVE ALSO BEEN MONITORING THE
MELTING LEVEL ON MODEL SOUNDINGS AND FROM ESTIMATES FROM KJKL AND
KMRX DUAL-POL RADAR IMAGERY...WHICH PLACE IT ROUGHLY BETWEEN 4-6
KFT AGL ATTM. AS A RESULT...SOME LIGHT SNOW COULD MIX IN WITH THIS
RAIN LATER TONIGHT ACROSS THE HIGHER MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS...THOUGH
VERY MINOR/NO ACCUMULATIONS ARE ANTICIPATED. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT
MOST AREAS WILL BE TOO WARM TO EXPERIENCE ANY SNOW AS CLOUDS AND
MOISTURE HAVE HELPED TO KEEP TEMPS UP HIGHER THAN EXPECTED SO FAR
THIS EVENING. THUS...HAVE ADJUSTED THE FORECAST TO REFLECT THIS.
LOWS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 30S ACROSS SW VIRGINIA AND
NE TENNESSEE AND THE LOW TO MID 40S ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE GREAT
TENNESSEE VALLEY.

THE PERIOD CLOSER TO THE 12Z GFSX MOS HIGHS. 

FLOW ALOFT BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WITH LIGHT 
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPING INTO THE WEEKEND. 
MODELS WERE IN BETTER AGREEMENT AND GENERALLY DRIER RIGHT INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...WITH 500 MB HEIGHTS ON THE INCREASE SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS 
THE UPPER RIDGE SPREADS EASTWARD OVER THE REGION. SOME SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN LONG RANGE MODELS...SO KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
IN FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. HOWEVER...LATEST ECMWF MODEL RUN IS 
DRIER THAN 12Z GFS RUN. GFS MODEL SEEMS TO GENERATE SOME LIGHT 
PRECIPITATION IN THE WARM AIR ADVECTION THAT DEVELOPS FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...WHICH MAY JUST EQUATE TO AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS. THE

AREA WILL WEAKEN TODAY WITH INCREASING HIGH/MID LEVEL CLOUDS BY
THIS AFTERNOON. SATELLITE ALREADY SHOWS INCREASING MID-LEVEL CLOUDS
OVER MID-TENNESSEE EARLY THIS MORNING DUE TO DEVELOPING SOUTHWEST
WINDS PRODUCING ISENTROPIC LIFT.

FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING...A FAST MOVING NORTHERN STREAM
SHORT-WAVE WILL TRY TO PHASE WITH A WEAK SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE OVER
NORTHERN MEXICO. UPPER JET ASSOCIATED WITH NORTHERN WAVE WILL PLACE
THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE
REGION OF THE JET. THIS JET WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTO-GENETIC LIFT
WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVING THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT AND TUESDAY
MORNING. ENOUGH MOISTURE STREAMING NORTH FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO
COMBINED WITH THE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING WILL PRODUCE LIKELY CHANCE
OF RAIN (GENERALLY LIGHT) LATE TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING.

CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA HAVE PROMOTED
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING THIS EVENING AS TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED
OFF STEADILY AFTER SUNSET ONCE AGAIN. SOME VERY DRY AIR HAS BEEN
PLACE ACROSS THE REGION...AS DEWPOINTS THIS AFTERNOON BOTTOMED
OUT IN THE SINGLE DIGITS TO LOWER TEENS. HOWEVER...LOW-LEVEL
MOISTURE WILL BE ON THE INCREASE OVERNIGHT AS WSW WINDS HELP TO
PUSH A PLUME OF MOISTURE NORTHEAST INTO THE REGION FROM TEXAS. THIS
WILL RAISE DEWPOINTS WELL INTO THE 20S AND HELP TO KEEP LOW
TEMPERATURES WARMER TONIGHT. MOST LOCATIONS ACROSS THE REGION WILL
BE AROUND 5 DEGREES OR SO WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT...AS THE MERCURY
WILL DROP INTO THE MID 20S TO LOWER 30S IN MOST AREAS.

IN THE SINGLE DIGITS. FOR NEXT FEW HOURS...VERY DRY AND BREEZY 
SEEING A COUPLE OF FIRES ON SATELLITE IN NWRN CWA. MOISTURE RETURN 
SHOULD BE FAIRLY QUICK TONIGHT AND MONDAY AS DEEPER SW FLOW 
CONTINUES.  TRAJECTORY FORECAST SHOWS THAT MOISTURE OVER E AND S 
TEXAS WILL BE STREAMING THIS WAY.  SHOULD GET STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS 
SPREADING ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AFTERNOON.  LOOKS LIKE MOISTURE IS 
ONLY LOW LEVEL BY END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD...SO NO POPS 
INCLUDED.  FOR MIN TEMP...WENT WARMER ON THE PLATEAU AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS CONDIDERING LIKELY INVERSION SETTING UP OVERNIGHT AND 
BREEZY CONDITIONS AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS TRENDING A BIT 
FASTER WITH COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT AND  
TUESDAY.  WILL KEEP POPS AT LIKELY CATEGORY AS WIDESPREAD SHOWERS

EXPECTED OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  PRECIP SHOULD END OVER MOST OF THE 
AREA TUESDAY AFTERNOON AS THE SYSTEM EXITS THE AREA.   HOWEVER...

ARRIVE AFTER THE END OF THESE TAFS...BUT SHOWING SCT050 AFT 14Z TO
SHOW INITIAL ARRIVAL. BASED ON CEILINGS OVER S TX AOB 030...WOULD

.DISCUSSION...
COOL AND CRISP MORNING GIVING WAY TO A PLEASANT AFTERNOON TODAY.
HOWEVER...THESE DRY AND WARMER CONDITIONS ALONG WITH AN INCREASING
SOUTHWESTERLY BREEZE WILL ALSO INCREASE THE WILD FIRE POTENTIAL
SOMEWHAT THIS AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL NOT BE STRONG...BUT HUMIDITY
VALUES WILL DEFINITELY BE LOW. SO THERE IS AN INCREASED THREAT OF
FIRE POTENTIAL THIS AFTERNOON.

ONE FACTOR IS THAT AREA OBS/MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOWED DRY AIR JUST OFF
THE SURFACE...AS THIS AIR MIXES DOWN INTO THE AFTERNOON...DEW
POINTS AND RH VALUES WILL DROP A LITTLE. THIS EVENING...THE
INCREASING SWLY WINDS START BRINGING MOISTURE BACK INTO THE
AREA...BUT NOT FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

FOR THIS UPDATE...MAIN TWEAKS...SLIGHT TWEAKS AT THAT...ARE THE
DEW POINTS AND WIND...ALSO BUMPED UP THE MAX TEMP IN ABINGDON
VICINITY BY A DEG OR TWO.

LOW AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES WITH INCREASE THREAT OF FIRE DANGER...BUT 
WINDS WILL REMAIN LIGHT. SURFACE RIDGING BREAKS DOWN FOR MONDAY WITH 
INCREASING CLOUDS. FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...A NORTHERN AND 
SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVES WILL EFFECT THE AREA. NORTHERN STREAM 
WAVE WILL PLACE THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT EXIT 
REGION OF THE JET ENHANCING FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG A SLOW 
MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THIS BOUNDARY WILL INCREASE LIFT OVER THE 
AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING. WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR 
LIKELY POPS OVER MUCH OF THE AREA. VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE 
SUGGEST THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS MAY HAVE A MIX OF RAIN/SNOW EARLY 
TUESDAY MORNING AND POSSIBLY TUESDAY EVENING AS COLDER AIR PULLS 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A TROUGH EXITING THE 
REGION ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING. WILL CONTINUE WITH 
THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR EVENING HOURS. LIGHT SNOW IS POSSIBLE OVER 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON TUESDAY NIGHT. THERE IS STILL A CHANCE OF 
UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUING OVER THE UPSLOPE AREAS ON WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY. 
THERE IS STILL MAJOR DIFFERENCES AMONG MODELS REGARDING A FRONT THAT

VERY MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING. A SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE TO THE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL BUILD NORTH AND EAST
OVERNIGHT...HELPING TO PROMOTE CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS. THERE IS A
PATCH OF DENSE LOW CLOUD COVER AND ASSOCIATED LOW/MID-LEVEL
ATMOSPHERIC MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF AN UPPER-LOW ACROSS THE
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. HOWEVER...THESE CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN
JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE REGION...KEEPING CONDITIONS CLEAR TO
MOSTLY CLEAR OVERNIGHT. AS A RESULT...GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING HAS
TAKEN PLACE THIS EVENING AS TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED STEADILY AFTER
SUNSET. THIS...COMBINED WITH THE COOL/DRY POST FRONTAL AIR MASS IN
PLACE ACROSS THE REGION WILL PROMOTE A HARD FREEZE AREAWIDE TONIGHT.
LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE LOW TO MID 20S IN MANY AREAS...WITH
SOME LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE HIGHER MOUNTAINS
DROPPING INTO THE UPPER TEENS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IS FILLING 
INTO THE REGION NOW...WITH THE RIDGE MOVING OVER THE AREA BY 
DAYBREAK.  THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING...BUT SOME 
MID LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE COMING ACROSS FOR A FEW HOURS ABOUT THAT 
TIME AS WELL.  NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE WAY OF A BLANKETING EFFECT 
FROM THE MINIMAL CLOUD LAYER THAT IS PRODUCED...BUT COULD HINDER A 
LITTLE COOLING.  SO NOT FORECASTING ALL THE WAY DOWN TO THE DRY DEW 
POINTS THAT WILL BE IN PLACE ACROSS THE AREA...BUT IT WILL BE WELL 
BELOW FREEZING AREA WIDE.

FOR SUNDAY...THE RIDGE MOVES TO THE EAST OF THE AREA AND THE RETURN 
FLOW STARTS UP WITH AN INCREASING SOUTHWEST WINDS. WINDS WILL NOT 
THREATEN RED FLAG CRITERIA...BUT VERY LOW RH LEVELS...MOSTLY IN THE 
20S...WILL SPELL POTENTIAL TROUBLE FOR WILD FIRES.  SOME LOCATIONS 
MAY EVEN GET RH VALUES BELOW 20%.  MAY HAVE SOME MID/HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS IN THE MORNING...BUT EXPECTING PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FOR THE

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM 
WILL BE APPROACHING THE AREA ON MONDAY WITH CLOUDS AND POSSIBLY A 
STRAY SHOWER MOVING IN LATE IN THE DAY. MAIN BAND OF ASSOCIATED

HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER AIR FILTERING INTO AREA SLOWLY.
STRATOCUMULUS CLOUD COVER OVER THE NORTHEASTERN AREAS LOOKS TO BE
PRETTY STUBBORN TO ERODE. MODEL SOUNDINGS WERE A LITTLE THICK ON
THE SATURATED DEPTH...BUT APPARENTLY ARE TOO OPTIMISTIC ON THE
SUBSIDENCE...BASED ON CLOUD TOP TEMPS HOLDING STEADY OR EVEN
COOLING/THICKENING. THINK THAT THE DECK WILL ERODE...BUT MORE
SLOWLY THAN THE MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST. CLOUD COVER IN THE
PRESENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD OVERALL...SO NOT MUCH CHANGE IN THE
FORECAST SKYGRIDS. LOOKS LIKE FLURRIES WILL STAY NORTH OF AREA.

BUMPED UP HIGH TEMP BY ABOUT 1 DEG IN THE NORTHERN AREAS...EVEN

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...COLD FRONT IS PRESSING THROUGH 
THE VIEWING AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND SHOULD EASILY BE EAST OF THE 
TN-NC BORDER BY 00Z SATURDAY. LOOKS LIKE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FOR MUCH 
OF THE REGION. HOWEVER...ENERGY DROPPING THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE EASTERN STATES UPPER TROUGH SHOULD BRING SOME MORE SC BACK INTO 
THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH EMPHASIS IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE 
MOUNTAINS ON THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. WITH MUCH COLDER AIR 
BUILDING IN ALOFT AND WITH NORTHWESTERLY FLOW IN PLACE THERE COULD 
BE A FEW SNOW FLURRIES IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. SOME LOW 
CLOUDS MAY HANG AROUND FOR A BRIEF PERIOD FOLLOWING SUNRISE ACROSS 
THE GREAT VALLEY OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA INTO NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
OTHERWISE...THERE SHOULD BE QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE ON SATURDAY BUT 
IT WILL NOT DO MUCH TO WARM THE SURFACE AS HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
RUNNING ABOUT 8 TO 12 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR LATE NOVEMBER.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SURFACE HIGH IN CONTROL 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE WEEKEND PROVIDING COOL AND DRY CONDITIONS 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.  THE NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHING THE AREA ON 
MONDAY WILL BRING IN MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS AND MAY GENERATE A 
STRAY ISOLATED SHOWER.  TIMING OF THE SYSTEM REMAINS IN QUESTION BUT 
GENERALLY LOOKS LIKE LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING.  HAVE 
CONTINUED CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY 
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF TUESDAY.  EXPECTED MAINLY RAIN ACROSS THE 
VALLEY WITH A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS... 
ESPECIALLY DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.  UPSLOPE RAIN AND SNOW SHOWER 
MAY LINGER INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY.  OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
BACK IN FOR THE END OF THE WEEK.

.AVIATION...DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT WITH THE FRONT IS REALLY
FADING FAST WITH A FEW SPRINKLES ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. LOOKS LIKE A BRIEF PERIOD OF BKN VFR CEILINGS
WITH THE FRONT THIS AFTERNOON BUT SATELLITE REVEALS A NICE AREA OF
DRY AIR FILLING IN BEHIND THE NARROW BAND OF FRONTAL CLOUDS SO
THERE WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AT TYS AND CHA THROUGH A GOOD PART
OF THE NIGHT. STAYED WITH BKN VFR CEILING AT TRI LATER TODAY AND
INTO THE EVENING HOURS AND FORECAST AN MVFR CEILING HERE FROM 03Z

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN TODAY ALLOWING A
COLD FRONT (CURRENTLY OVER EXTREME WESTERN TENNESSEE) TO MOVE
ACROSS THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON. MOST OF THE DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED
WITH UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE AREA WITH THE MAIN
FORCING BEING WEAK FRONT0-GENETIC. PERSISTENT RIDING INTO THE
NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL NOT ALLOW RETURN FLOW OF GULF MOISTURE
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS..SO MOISTURE WITH THE SYSTEM WILL BE
LIMITED. RADAR DOES SHOW A NARROW BAND OF SHOWERS JUST BEHIND THE
FRONT. WILL CONTINUE TO CALL FOR LOW CHANCE POPS. MAINLY LOCATIONS
WILL RECEIVE VERY LIGHT RAIN...BUT CHANCES FOR MEASURABLE IS LOW.

COLDER AIR WILL SPILL INTO THE REGION FOR TONIGHT WITH SOME UPSLOPE
PRECIPITATION POSSIBLE FOR THE NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO 
THE REGION PROVIDING A COOL DRY WEEKEND. A FRONT TRACKING IN THE 
AREA ON LATE MONDAY AND LINGERS INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING...WITH THE 
HIGHEST CHANCES ARE ON TUESDAY. IT SHOULD BE MAINLY RAIN BUT  A MIX 
OF RAIN AND SNOW IS POSSIBLE OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO EXIT THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT BUT 
THERE IS STILL A CHANCE OF UPSLOPE RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUING 
OVER THE UPSLOPE AREAS ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS 
BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY. STAYED NEAR MEX AND HPC GUIDANCE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL REMAIN OVER THE FORECAST AREA
THROUGH MOST OF THE NIGHT. THIS CONTINUED RIDGING EXTENDING INTO TO
THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL ONLY ALLOW LIMITED MOISTURE RETURN
NORTH INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MODELS ONLY
SHOW A NARROW BAND OF MOISTURE ALONG AND AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING
COLD FRONT FOR FRIDAY. ALSO...DYNAMICS WITH THE FRONT WILL MAINLY
STAY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL ONLY KEEP MINIMAL POPS
FOR TOMORROW...PER GOING FORECAST.

AFTER FROPA FRIDAY AFTERNOON...CONDITIONS QUICKLY DRY OUT OVER MOST
OF THE AREA..EXCEPT FOR THE NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS WHERE SOME
OROGRAPHIC NORTHWEST FLOW PRECIPITATION IS POSSIBLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WITH 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN ON SATURDAY FOR GENERALLY A COOL 
AND DRY WEEKEND.  A COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE AREA ON MONDAY WILL 
INCREASE CLOUDS AND MAY BRING IN A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS IN ADVANCE 
OF THE FRONT LATE IN THE DAY.  THERE REMAINS SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES 
FOR THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AND WILL KEEP HIGH CHANCE POPS IN PLACE 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.  SHOULD BE MAINLY A RAIN EVENT THOUGH A 
MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW IS EXPECTED OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS DURING THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS.  PRECIP SHOULD EXIT FROM WEST TO EAST ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT WITH LINGERING UPSLOPE RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUING OVER 
NORMALLY FAVORED AREAS ON WEDNESDAY.  HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD

.SHORT TERM /THANKSGIVING DAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN ABSOLUTELY BEAUTIFUL THANKSGIVING DAY IS ON TAP AS A UPPER
RIDGE AXIS BUILDS INTO THE AREA TODAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN
CLEAR/MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPS
ALOFT...AND SUBSEQUENTLY EVEN WARMER HIGHS FOR TODAY. THE MERCURY
IS PROGGED TO CLIMB INTO THE LOWER 70S ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE
AND INTO THE MID TO UPPER 60S ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.
CLEAR CONDITIONS DURING THE EVENING WILL GIVE WAY TO INCREASING
CLOUD COVER OVERNIGHT AHEAD OF AN ADVANCING COLD FRONT FROM THE
LOWER- MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THAT WILL TRACK EASTWARD TOWARD THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. HOWEVER...ANY PRECIPITATION
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE WILL LIKELY OCCUR AFTER DAYBREAK ON
BLACK FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
MOISTURE DOES SEEM LACKING WITH THE COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY...BUT
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS STILL SEEM JUSTIFIED. LIGHT MEASURABLE
PRECIPITATION DOES SEEM POSSIBLE...SO CARRIED LOW POPS ALSO FOR THE
SRN AREAS INSTEAD OF SPRINKLES. DRY FORECAST LOOKS GOOD FOR THE
WEEKEND WITH NW FLOW ALOFT TRANSITIONING TO A ZONAL FLOW. THIS
KEEPS TEMPS MUCH CLOSER TO SEASONAL NORMALS...AFTER A COOL DOWN ON
SATURDAY.

A STRONGER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND COLD FRONT WILL REACH THE 
FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. MODELS GENERALLY SEEM TO 
BE A BIT SLOWER...SO ANY SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS MADE WERE TO HOLD 
SHOWERS OFF UNTIL LATE MONDAY NIGHT. TIMING OF THE FRONT WOULD 
SUPPORT LIKELY POPS ON TUESDAY...SO POPS WERE INCREASED SLIGHTLY...
BUT SEEMS EARLY TO GO 60 PERCENT OR HIGHER JUST YET EXCEPT FOR NW 
AREAS. FORECAST SOUNDINGS DON'T REVEAL MUCH OF A LAPSE RATE WITH 
JUST VERY MINIMAL INSTABILITY...AND NO HINT OF ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
EITHER. THUS...I CAN SEE A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TO OUR WEST OVER 
MIDDLE TN TUESDAY AFTERNOON...BUT JUST SHOWERS FOR OUR REGION. 

22/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE IN AGREEMENT WITH PREVIOUS 2 MODEL RUNS
SO JUST SOME SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS NEEDED AT THIS POINT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL KEEP CONDITIONS DRY THROUGH
THURSDAY NIGHT. DEWPOINTS WILL REMAIN LOW WITH AFTERNOON RELATIVE
HUMIDITIES FALLING INTO THE 20S MOST LOCATIONS THURSDAY. A COLD
FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY WITH MAIN UPPER
DYNAMICS STAYING NORTH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. ALSO...RIDGING OVER
THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL KEEP THE MOISTURE FROM STREAMING NORTH INTO
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AHEAD OF THE FRONT. LIMITED MOISTURE AND
WEAK UPPER DYNAMICS WILL KEEP CHANCES LOW WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH
PRECIPITATION LIMITED TO SPRINKLES MOST LOCATIONS.

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...NORTHWEST FLOW INTO THE NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS WILL
PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS...POSSIBLY MIXING WITH SNOW. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FRIDAY SYSTEM WILL BE ON 
ITS WAY OUT ALLOWING A RETURN TO INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE 
SATURDAY INTO MONDAY AS A COLDER NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT 
TRANSITIONS TO ZONAL ON SUNDAY. THE NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WILL BE AMPLIFYING ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS ON MONDAY WHICH ALLOWS A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW TO STRENGTHEN 
ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. HELPING TO BOOST TEMPERATURES BACK A FEW 
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL MONDAY AND TUESDAY. ALONG WITH THE 
STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL COME A MOISTENING ATMOSPHERE WHICH 
WILL BE LIFTED AHEAD OF A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE LOW WILL 
DRIVE NORTHEAST OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE UPPER OHIO 
VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT DRAGGING A COLDER AIRMASS 
TOWARD THE EAST COAST. ECMWF A LITTLE FASTER WITH THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE MAIN EVENT WILL OCCUR ON TUESDAY AND 
ADJUSTED POPS JUST A LITTLE HIGHER INTO THE GOOD CHANCE REALM FOR 
THIS PERIOD TWEAKING BACK TO MEDIUM CHANCE TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE MAIN 
LIFT WITH THE FRONT HEADS EAST OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS 
INDICATE SOME TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND MOISTURE DIVING THROUGH 
THE BACK SIDE OF THE UPPER TROUGH LATER TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY 
SO KEPT SOME SMALL AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR THIS PERIOD. THE CHILLY AIR ADVECTING 
INTO THE REGION WILL ALLOW FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS TO DEVELOP WITH 
MAIN IMPACT AT THIS TIME APPEARING TO BE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PASSING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA EARLY
THIS MORNING...BRINGING SOME LOW/MID LEVEL DECKS OF CLOUD COVER AND
SOME ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS THAT HAVE GRADUALLY DIMINISHED OVER THE
COURSE OF THE NIGHT. IN WAKE OF THIS TROUGH...SOME CLEARING SKIES
WILL RESULT IN MOSTLY/PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS FOR TODAY ALONG WITH
SOME CONTINUED MILD TEMPERATURES AS AN UPPER RIDGE AXIS BEGINS TO
BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS WILL
RESULT IN HIGHS PEAKING IN THE 60S AREAWIDE ONCE AGAIN. TONIGHT...
SKIES WILL BE CLEAR RESULTING IN GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AND LOWS
BOTTOMING OUT IN THE 30S TO THE LOWER 40S IN FAR SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE.

.LONG TERM /THANKSGIVING THROUGH TUESDAY/...
LOOKS LIKE GREAT WEATHER FOR THANKSGIVING AS THE SURFACE AND UPPER
RIDGE EXTEND RIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPS SHOULD HAVE NO
PROBLEM REACHING AROUND 5 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS...SO
MOSTLY 50S TO NEAR 70 DEGREES.

FOR FRIDAY...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DROPS SE FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST 
AND GREAT LAKES REGIONS. THIS FLATTENS OUR UPPER RIDGE WITH AN 
ASSOCIATED RATHER WEAK LOOKING COLD FRONT DEVELOPING. THIS FRONT 
ONLY WARRANTS LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SW VA/NE TN WITH JUST SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS ELSEWHERE. MOISTURE BECOMES QUITE SHALLOW BY FRIDAY 
EVENING AFTER PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT...SO I KEPT JUST SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR THE NE AREAS AND SMOKIES FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.  

PRESSURE GRADIENT IS FAIRLY TIGHT INTO EARLY SATURDAY...SO BREEZY NW 
WINDS AS SKIES BECOME SOME DEGREE OF SUNNY. 850 MB TEMPS TAKE A 
SIGNIFICANT PLUNGE ON SATURDAY...SO LOOKING AT A MUCH COOLER DAY 
WITH HIGHS ONLY 30S SW VA TO NEAR 50 ACROSS SE TN/SW NC. 

CONTINUED DRY FORECAST THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH CHILLY MIN TEMPS 
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN TEMPS BEGIN A GRADUAL WARMING TREND INTO 
TUESDAY. MODELS SEEM IN UNUSUALLY GOOD AGREEMENT ON A STRONGER LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TO AFFECT US BY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. KEPT OUR 
CHANCE POPS GOING FOR THOSE PERIODS FOR NOW...BUT MAY BE ABLE TO 
NUDGE UP TO LOW END OF LIKELY POPS IF MODELS REMAIN CONSISTENT. WE 
COULD ALSO SEE A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS ON TUESDAY GIVEN THE TRACK 
AND TIMING AS ADVERTISED BY MOST MODELS. HOWEVER...I DID NOT ADD 
THUNDER JUST YET. 

SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO MAX/MIN TEMPS IN LINE WITH 21/00Z GFSX

.SHORT TERM.../TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING HAS
PRODUCED A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OR SPRINKLES OVER MIDDLE TN /-RA AT
KBNA/. WAITING TO SEE HOW MUCH PCPN CAN REACH THE SURFACE AT
CSV...BUT OPTED TO ADD A MENTION OF SPRINKLES OUT TO 15Z
TODAY...MAINLY THE PLATEAU COUNTIES AND WRN AREAS EARLY. ASSOCIATED
CLOUDS WILL THICKEN TO OVERCAST THIS MORNING THEN MAY BREAK UP A
BIT. THIS SHOULD KEEP HIGHS A FEW DEGREES BELOW MONDAY MAXES...SO I
OPTED TO GO JUST BELOW THE GFS MOS MAXES.

UPPER TROUGH BRIEFLY OVER THE REGION TONIGHT WILL DEEPEN...SO I DO 
EXPECT ANOTHER INCREASE IN CLOUDS BY 21/03Z OR LATER. WON'T ADD ANY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OR SPRINKLES...BUT WORTH KEEPING MOSTLY CLOUDY
SKIES. THE HEIGHT OF CLOUDS TONIGHT WILL BE MUCH LOWER AND SHOULD
AFFECT MIN TEMPS...MAKING THE MILDER NAM MINS OR A BLEND BETTER
THAN THE COOLER GFS MINS.


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
FAIRLY BENIGN WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD. IN WAKE OF AN UPPER-TROUGH PASSAGE...AN UPPER-SUBTROPICAL 
RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION WEDNESDAY INTO THANKSGIVING 
DAY...PROMOTING CONTINUED WARM AND DRY CONDITIONS...WITH HIGHS
PEAKING IN THE 60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES IN A FEW SPOTS IN SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE ON THANKSGIVING. HOWEVER...ON BLACK FRIDAY ANOTHER UPPER-
LEVEL STORM SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL DRIVE A COLD
FRONT THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. GIVEN
THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF MOISTURE...HAVE KEPT POPS FAIRLY LOW /IN
ACCORDANCE WITH MODEL GUIDANCE/ AND IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY.
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW FAIRLY LIGHT QPF SIGNALS AS THE FRONT
MOVES INTO THE AREA AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LIGHT SHOWERS
FRIDAY...BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF DURING THE EVENING AS THE FRONT
PUSHES EAST. COLDER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION IN WAKE OF THE
FRONT...DROPPING HIGHS BACK INTO THE 40S TO LOW 50S ON SATURDAY.
THEREAFTER HOWEVER...A WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR AS ZONAL FLOW
RETURNS BY SUNDAY...BEFORE THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM POTENTIALLY
APPROACHES THE AREA BY MONDAY...RESULTING IN INCREASED CLOUD COVER
AND RAIN CHANCES LATE IN THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...BASED ON SOME MODEL
DIFFERENCES IN THE EXTENDED...HAVE INCREASED POPS ON DAY 7 ONLY
SLIGHTLY AND WILL WAIT FOR BETTER CONTINUITY BEFORE MAKING ANY
FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS.

LOW CLOUDS OR EVEN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR TODAY OR TONIGHT. 
THUS...I DROPPED ANY MENTION OF RAIN CHANCES FROM TONIGHT'S WEATHER 
GRIDS. 

IF HIGH CLOUDS STAY THIN IN THE AFTERNOON...I EXPECT MAX TEMPS AT 
LEAST AS WARM AS YESTERDAY. PARTIAL THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS 
SUPPORT ABOUT 1 TO 3 DEGREES WARMER THAN SUNDAY'S HIGHS. SO...I WENT 
AT LEAST AS WARM AS GFS MOS. MINS TONIGHT SHOULD BE MILDER GIVEN 
PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES. MOS GUIDANCE WAS IN DISAGREEMENT WITH 
NAM MINS MILDER THAN COOLER GFS MINS...SO A BLEND WAS BEST CHOICE 
FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE TO KEEP
FORECAST AREA DRY TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT WITH SE COASTAL SYSTEM
CONTINUING TO SPIN OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST. WEAK UPPER TROUGH 
MOVING INTO TN VALLEY WILL INCREASE CLOUD COVER EARLY TUESDAY AND
MOVE ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY. UPPER RIDGE THEN
STRENGTHENS LATER WEDNESDAY THROUGH EARLY FRIDAY. HIGHS WILL
CONTINUE TO BE ABOVE NORMAL TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. RAISED HIGHS A
FEW DEGREES FOR THIS TIME PERIOD. RIDGE BUILDS IN STRONGEST ON
THANKSGIVING. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GUIDANCE BUT HIGHS MAY NEED TO BE
RAISED A FEW MORE DEGREES. ANOTHER WEAK FRONT BREAKS DOWN STRONG
RIDGE FRIDAY AND QUICKLY TRACKS ACROSS THE REGION. BEST CHANCE FOR
RAIN FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. BIG COOL DOWN BEHIND FRONT AS
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND FRONT DROPS TEMPERATURES ABOUT 10
TO 15 DEGREES SATURDAY...THEN SLIGHT WARMING SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL 
CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...AND WILL 
BE OVERTAKEN BY RIDGING FROM THE WEST BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. 
WESTWARD MOVING RIDGE WILL CUT OFF THE BASE OF THE WEAK LONGWAVE 
TROUGH. MODELS INDICATE A WEAK CLOSED OFF LOW DUE TO THE RIDGE 
PINCHING OFF THE BASE OF THE TROUGH. THIS AREA OF WEAK LOW PRESSURE 
WILL NOT HAVE AN AFFECT ON OUR CWA AS IT IS WILL BE PUSHED TO OUR 
SOUTH AND EAST ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY BY ADVANCING RIDGE. 
THIS LOW WILL BRING AN INCREASE IN SHOWERS AND CLOUDS TO THE COASTAL 
CAROLINAS ON SUNDAY...WITH MOISTURE ADVECTING WEST. HOWEVER...THE 
APPALACHIANS...COMBINED WITH THE MORE DOMINANT RIDGING...WILL 
INHIBIT MOISTURE FROM ADVECTING INTO OUR AREA. THIS WILL KEEP 
CONDITIONS CALM AND MOSTLY CLEAR THROUGH SUNDAY.  

WENT WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR MIN TEMPS TONIGHT AS WE ARE 
UNDER NEUTRAL ADVECTION CONDITIONS. A SLIGHT WARM UP IS EXPECTED ON 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS MODELS SHOW A SLIGHT INCREASE IN THICKNESS 
VALUES DUE TO ADVANCEMENT OF RIDGE. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED 
VERY GOOD WITH LITTLE CHANGES MADE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
REGION BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY.  A 
TROUGH TRACKING THROUGH THE AREA IN THE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY TIME 
FRAME BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. WILL CONTINUE THE LOW CHANCE FOR 
FOR BOTH DAYS WITH HIGHEST CHANCE ON TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE 
RETURNS WITH DRY WEATHER EXPECTED ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. STAYED

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A WEAK TROUGH 
LINGERING GENERALLY ALONG THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME SCATTERED HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE MID MS 
AND TN RIVER VALLEYS ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. 
THESE HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. THE TEMP/DEWPOINT SPREAD TONIGHT IS EXPECTED 
TO BECOME MINIMAL TOWARDS SUNRISE...WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE FOG 
FORMATION...ESPECIALLY AROUND BODIES OF WATER WHICH ARE STILL 
RELATIVELY WARM THIS TIME OF YEAR. THE HIGH CLOUDS WITH THE UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH WILL PROBABLY INHIBIT WIDESPREAD FOG FORMATION 
OVERNIGHT...BUT THINK IT IS PRUDENT TO MENTION AT LEAST SOME PATCHY 
FOG TOWARDS SUNRISE...CONSIDERING THE FAVORABLE TIME OF YEAR FOR FOG 
DEVELOPMENT.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO MENTION 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND PATCHY FOG TOWARDS SUNRISE.

OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT AN UPPER- 
LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL SWING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...A WEAKENING SHORT WAVE WILL 
MOVE EAST THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TONIGHT AND THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS EARLY THURSDAY. AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH 
WILL DEVELOP NE IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING SHORT WAVE. THE SURFACE
TROUGH WILL WEAKLY DEEPEN INTO SW VA TONIGHT BEFORE SLIDING EAST 
THROUGH THE MOUNTAINS THURSDAY. AIRMASS IS INITIALLY DRY WITH 
SURFACE DEWPOINTS IN THE 20S. GOOD LIFT IN ADVANCE OF SHORTWAVE BUT 
LAYER MOISTURE LIMITED SO ONLY VIRGA EXPECTED AT BEST FOR MOST 
AREAS. STRONG LOW LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPS TONIGHT S OF THE 
AREA AND REACHES INTO SW NC TONIGHT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RAPIDLY 
INCREASES UP TO 700 MB OVER THE CAROLINAS AND TO ALONG THE EXTREME 
EAST TN BORDER. MODELS DEPICT A GOOD WARM UP OVERNIGHT BUT STAYED
TOWARD A COOLER SOLUTION. KEPT SUB FREEZING TEMPERATURES IN NORTHERN 
AND EASTERN ZONES. THIS CALLS FOR SOME FREEZING RAIN IN THE 
MOUNTAINS WITH LIGHT AMOUNTS ANTICIPATED.  

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
FAIRLY BENIGN WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WITH NEAR SEASONABLE TEMPS AND DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND INTO THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK. AN UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL DIG IN AND SWING ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES 
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...BUT OTHER THAN A WIND SHIFT TO THE 
NORTHEAST /WHICH WILL HELP TO REINFORCE SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER 
TEMPS/...THE LACK OF LIFT AND MOISTURE WILL KEEP SHOWERS OUT OF THE 
FORECAST. A VERY GRADUAL WARMING TREND WILL THEN OCCUR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY AS ZONAL FLOW RETURNS ALOFT AND HIGHS CLIMB BACK INTO THE 
LOW TO PERHAPS MID 60S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS AREAWIDE WITH AMPLE 
SUNSHINE. HOWEVER...ANOTHER LONGWAVE IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE 
REGION TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY...AND DEPENDING ON THE TRACK AND 
AMOUNT OF MOISTURE PRESENT...IT COULD GIVE THE AREA IT'S FIRST SHOT 
OF SCATTERED PRECIP IN ABOUT A WEEK. HOWEVER...THE LONG TERM MODEL 
SOLUTIONS DIFFER WITH THE TIMING AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP CHANCES. THE 
ECMWF IS TRENDING A BIT FASTER AND IS MORE BULLISH WITH QPF SIGNALS 
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. THE GFS IS STILL TRENDING SLOWER AND 
DRIER...SHOWING A FEW MODEST LIGHT QPF SIGNALS LATE TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY. GIVEN THESE DIFFERENCES...HAVE KEPT LOW-END 
MENTIONABLE POPS ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND ON WEDNESDAY...THOUGH CONFIDENCE IN THIS ATTM IS STILL LOW.

ON WEDNESDAY IN ASSOCIATION WITH A SHORTWAVE TROUGH. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE VERY DRY AIR FROM 850-600MB THROUGH TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON. OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL BE CONSIDERABLY COLDER THAN 
THIS MORNING DUE TO EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL COOLING. HOWEVER... 
WEDNESDAY DAYTIME TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN TODAY.

UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA OVER THE WEEKEND. BOTH MODELS 
HAVE ALSO COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT THIS RUN WITH THE AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE EXPECTED WITH EACH OF THESE SHORT WAVES...AND GENERALLY 
INDICATE A DRY FORECAST THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF SOME LIGHT RAIN OVER THE MOUNTAINS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

300 AM EST MON NOV 12 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE 
AREA TODAY.  A BAND OF SHOWERS WILL SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE 
AREA...EXITING EASTERN ZONES TONIGHT.  INSTABILITY LOOKS QUITE 
LIMITED...SO NO MENTION OF THUNDER FOR NOW.  WILL CARRY CAT POPS ALL 
ZONES TODAY. CAT POPS NORTHEAST TO SLIGHT CHANCE FAR WESTERN ZONES 
EARLY TONIGHT...AND THEN PRECIP FREE BY LATE TONIGHT.  COLDER AND 
DRIER AIR WILL PUSH IN BEHIND THE FRONT...WITH A CLEARING SKY 
OVERNIGHT ONCE THE PRECIP ENDS. WIND ADVISORY THROUGH NOON STILL 
LOOKS GOOD...SO NO CHANGES THERE. WILL GO ABOVE MAV TEMPS TODAY AS 
EXPECT SOME WARMING AHEAD OF THE PRECIP...THEN WILL GENERALLY GO A 
BIT BELOW MAV NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAINTAINED CONTINUITY WITH THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH KEEPS THE REGION DRY THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
HOWEVER...MODELS ARE NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT. A COUPLE OF WEAK 
SHORT WAVE TROUGHS MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH THE 
FIRST BUILDING THROUGH WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. 
BOTH THE ECMWF AND THE GFS REALLY SLOW DOWN THE LATTER WAVE AND EVEN 
CLOSE OFF AN UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE AREA SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. THE 
SHORT WAVELENGTH SYSTEMS WILL ENCOURAGE AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH 
INTO FORMATION ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WITH EXTENSION NORTH 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. ADDED A FEW CLOUDS TO THE MIX ACROSS THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. IN THIS SCENARIO 
MODELS FAVOR PRECIPITATION DEVELOPING OVER THE CAROLINAS BUT I 
CERTAINLY WOULDN'T BE SURPRISED IF SOME LIGHT QPF DEVELOPED OVER 
EASTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. ADJUSTED THE TEMPERATURE 
FORECAST WITH THE AID OF MEX MOS GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...
A STRONG COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE AREA IN THE SHORT TERM 
PERIOD. TONIGHT...A SOUTHERLY LLJ STRENGTHENS TO 45-50 KTS AT 850 
MB. THIS WILL CREATE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR MOUNTAIN WAVE WINDS 
ACROSS THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS. THE WIND ADVISORY FROM 
00Z TONIGHT TO NOON TOMORROW APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. OBS THIS 
AFTERNOON HAVE SHOWN GUSTS OF 25-30 MPH IN SOME SPOTS...AND GUSTS UP 
TO 50 MPH WILL BE POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT. 

MODELS SHOW THAT PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD FRONT WILL BE ALONG 
OR BEHIND THE FRONT...WITH VERY LITTLE AHEAD OF IT. THIS SEEMS TO 
MATCH WITH CURRENT WV IMAGERY OVER THE PLAINS...WHICH SHOWS THE 
UPPER TROUGH LAGGING WELL BEHIND THE SURFACE FRONT. SO WILL DELAY 
THE ONSET OF POPS UNTIL AFTER 12Z MON. THE SURFACE FRONT PUSHES 
THROUGH THE AREA IN THE 18-00Z TIME FRAME...WITH PRECIP TRAILING 
BEHIND AND CONTINUING PAST MIDNIGHT. WITH THE STRONG LLJ AND LOW 
LEVEL THETA-E VALUES NEAR 320K...WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY AFTERNOON. DRY ADVECTION AND CLEARING WILL 
QUICKLY FOLLOW THE BACK EDGE OF PRECIP BETWEEN 06-12Z TUESDAY. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
ANOTHER QUIET PERIOD BEGINS TUESDAY AS FRONT AND PRECIPITATION MOVES 
EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS BY TUESDAY MORNING. SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES 
BRING HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND MS VALLEY TO OVER 
THE OHIO AND TN VALLEYS TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. COLD AIR 
ADVECTION BEHIND FRONT WILL CAUSE A BIG DROP IN HIGHS FROM THE 60S 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT TO 40S HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SW VA...TO THE 50S 
LOWER TN VALLEY ELEVATIONS. AIR MASS BECOMES DRIER AS WELL WITH DEW 
POINTS DROPPING INTO THE 20S. SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT WITH LOWS MID 20S TO LOWER 30S...AND COLDER HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO THURSDAY MORNING MODELS 
DISAGREE WITH POSSIBLE WEAK BOUNDARY JUST TO THE SOUTH AND SHORTWAVE 
ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE BASE OF UPPER TROUGH BEHIND TOMORROWS 
FRONT POSSIBLY CAUSING A FEW SHOWERS TO DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. CANADIAN AND ECMWF SHOWING THIS FEATURE BUT GFS DRY. WILL 
LEAVE DRY FOR NOW BUT MAY NEED TO INCREASE CLOUDS AND HAVE SLIGHT 
CHANCE SHOWERS ADDED FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT PERIOD. THURSDAY AFTERNOON 
THROUGH SUNDAY HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER EASTERN THIRD OF THE 
COUNTRY WITH MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS EXPECTED AND SEASONABLE 
TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR EAST 
WILL GIVE WAY TO AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT TONIGHT. AFTER A MOSTLY 
SUNNY DAY TODAY...CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT AND SHOWERS MAY MAKE 
IT INTO MAINLY WESTERN AREAS TONIGHT.  A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET 
WILL INCREASE AHEAD OF THE FRONT...AND LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE SOME

COURSE WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE ON MONDAY AND TWEAKED POPS UP A TAD 
AS CONFIDENCE LEVELS CONTINUE TO INCREASE WITH EVENT WHICH MAY 
INCLUDE A COUPLE THUNDERSTORMS RIGHT ALONG THE FRONTAL SURFACE. 
SHOWERS APPEAR LIKELY ACROSS AT LEAST EASTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA MONDAY EVENING SO KEPT HIGH PROBABILITIES HERE WHILE TAPERING 
SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT AS DRIER AIR SPILLS IN BEHIND THE COLD 
FRONT. KEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST DRY ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE IN 
THIS FAIR WEATHER SCENARIO IS A LITTLE LOWER AS MODEL SOLUTIONS 
DIVERGE QUITE A BIT. THE GFS GENERALLY STAYS THE COURSE FROM THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST HOWEVER...THE ECMWF AND CMC INDICATE WETTER 
SOLUTIONS WITH A MID WEEK SHORT WAVE FEATURE. WILL WAIT FOR LATER 
MODEL RUNS TO SEE HOW THIS IS RESOLVED. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED JUST OFF THE OUTER BANKS...AND A
DEEP TROUGH AND STRONG JET WILL BE MOVING INTO THE PLAINS TONIGHT
AND TOMORROW. THIS WILL PRODUCE A TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT
ACROSS OUR AREA...AND A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW. WE WILL SEE
CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT...WITH HIGH CLOUDS INCREASING TOMORROW AS THE
UPPER RIDGE AXIS MOVES EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. THE 850 MB FLOW
PICKS UP TO 35-40 KTS BY THE AFTERNOON. COULD POTENTIALLY BE NEAR
WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS
AND FOOTHILLS AS A FAVORABLE MOUNTAIN WAVE PATTERN SETS UP. HIGHS
WILL BE WARM AGAIN ON SUNDAY...IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL BRING RAIN AND SOME
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. THE BEST RAINFALL 
WILL OCCUR BETWEEN NOON MONDAY AND MIDNIGHT MONDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM 
WILL BE QUICK TO PASS THROUGH AND BY TUESDAY WE WILL SEE A RETURN OF 
NICER WEATHER THAT WILL PERSIST FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK. BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES TUES AND WED BUT REBOUNDING BACK TO OR A LITTLE 
ABOVE NORMAL FROM THURSDAY AFTERNOON ONWARD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR EAST 
WILL CONTINUE TO CONTROL OUR WEATHER FOR THE SHORT TERM. MAY SEE A 
FEW MOSTLY HIGH CLOUDS ESPECIALLY TONIGHT...BUT SHOULD BE MAINLY 
CLEAR FOR THE PERIOD.  THE WARMING TREND WILL CONTINUE TODAY WITH 
TEMPS RISING ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.       

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY EXPECTED 
ON VETERAN'S DAY WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE AND HIGH 
TEMPERATURES A GOOD TEN DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL AS THE LOW LEVEL 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF THE AMPLIFIED PLAINS UPPER 
TROUGH. MODELS KEEP SPEEDING THIS SYSTEM UP WITH EACH RUN AND MADE 
THE PROPER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE GRIDDED DATABASE. TWEAKED POPS UP TO 
CATEGORICAL MUCH OF THE WESTERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
LIKELY PROBABILITY STILL GOING ELSEWHERE ON MONDAY. THE FRONT MAY BE 
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS BY 00Z TUESDAY BUT RAIN MAY LINGER BEHIND 
THE FROPA MONDAY NIGHT. NICE STRONG SYSTEM WITH A TIGHT PRESSURE 
GRADIENT BUT THE ATMOSPHERE LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE TOO STABLE FOR 
CONVECTION SO KEPT THUNDER OUT OF THE FORECAST. MOST OF THE RAIN 
SHOULD BE EAST OF THE REGION BY 12Z TUESDAY BUT THERE IS A SMALL 
CHANCE FOR A SHOWER EARLY IN THE DAY EASTERN SECTIONS BEFORE RAPID 
DRYING BEGINS. MAINTAINED A DRY AND SUNNY FORECAST FOR MID TO LATE 
WEEK BUT CONFIDENCE LEVEL A LITTLE LOWER AS THE MODELS ARE HINTING 
AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW MORE "RIPPLES" IN THE ZONAL FLOW 
PATTERN. STAYED CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE TEMPERATURE BLEND SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY CONCERNING MAXES BUT TRIMMED A DEGREE OR TWO OFF HIGHS DURING 
THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST. DID NOT STRAY FAR FROM SUGGESTED 
MINS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY 
WILL SHIFT EAST TO THE NC/SC COAST TOMORROW. ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE 
RIDGE...WE WILL SEE SLIGHTLY RISING DEWPOINTS AND A LIGHT SW FLOW. 
THIS SHOULD RESULT IN LOW TEMPS TONIGHT A BIT WARMER THAN PREVIOUS 
NIGHTS. WE WILL ALSO SEE HIGH TEMPS TOMORROW RISING WELL ABOVE 
CLIMATOLOGICAL NORMALS...INTO THE LOWER 70S ACROSS MUCH OF THE TN 
VALLEY. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
FAIRLY SIMPLE SETTING FOR THIS SET OF DAYS...WITH ONLY ONE MAIN
SYSTEM IN THE MIDDLE OF THE PERIOD. STARTING WITH SATURDAY
EVENING...WITH UPPER RIDGE OVERHEAD BUT ABOUT TO EXIT TO THE EAST
AND A SURFACE SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW HAS BEGUN. AROUND MONDAY/MONDAY
EVENING THERE SHOULD BE A STRONG COLD FRONT THAT PASSES THROUGH.
MODELS STILL SHOW MOIST LOW LEVEL DEW POINTS IN THE 50S ACROSS THE
AREA...BUT AIR MASS IS NOT EXPECTED TO GET VERY UNSTABLE. WILL NOT
HAVE THUNDER IN FORECAST FOR FRONTAL PASSAGE...MERELY SHOWERS.
HOWEVER...THERE IS A STRONG WIND FIELD ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
FRONT...SO EVEN SHOWERS COULD PROVIDE DOWNWARD TRANSPORT OF GUSTY
IF NOT ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS. THIS OPPORTUNITY FOR STRONGER WINDS
WILL BE BRIEF HOWEVER SINCE MUCH COOLER SURFACE AIR SURGES INTO THE
REGION...AND WILL BREAK THE CONNECTION TO THE DYNAMIC WINDS ALOFT.
FRONT AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP SHOULD EXIT PRETTY QUICKLY ON TUESDAY.
A SHORTWAVE PASSES THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY...BUT WILL KEEP THIS PART
OF THE FORECAST DRY. ADDITIONALLY...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
INTO THE REGION FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK AND SHOULD KEEP THE
AREA DRY AS WELL. WENT VERY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPERATURE VALUES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE OUR 
WEATHER FOR THE SHORT TERM.  SHOULD SEE A FEW HIGH CLOUDS 
AROUND...BUT OVERALL SHOULD BE MAINLY CLEAR WITH LIGHT WINDS.  WILL 
ALLOW FREEZE WARNING TO CONTINUE UNTIL THE 13Z EXPIRATION TIME.  
WILL NOT ARGUE MUCH WITH MAV TEMPS FOR THE SHORT TERM.      

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A NICE AMPLIFIED PATTERN 
WILL BE IN PLACE FROM THE WEEKEND THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE NEW 
WEEK. THE FORECAST AREA ENJOYS THE RIDGE ASPECT OF THIS PATTERN 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ALLOWING FOR MAXIMUM SUNSHINE AND PLEASANTLY 
WARM TEMPERATURES WHICH SHOULD RUN A GOOD TEN DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL 
FOR EARLY NOVEMBER AS STEADILY STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL 
FLOW DEVELOPS. BY MONDAY THE WESTERN STATES UPPER TROUGH WILL HAVE 
PROGRESSED INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH SURFACE COLD FRONT 
PRESSING INTO WESTERN TENNESSEE BY 12Z (A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST). EVEN STILL...MAINTAINED A POP GRADIENT WITH 
SHOWERS AND A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGH 00Z 
TUESDAY WITH LIKELY CATEGORY WEST AND CHANCE CATEGORY EAST IN CASE 
SYSTEM MOVES SLOWER. STAYED WITH LIKELY POPS MONDAY NIGHT WHILE 
TAPERING BACK AFTER MIDNIGHT AS MODELS GENERALLY AGREE FRONT MOVES 
FAIRLY QUICKLY TOWARD THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. KEPT A SLIGHT AND 
LOW CHANCE POP FOR EASTERN SECTIONS MAINLY FIRST HALF OF THE DAY 
TUESDAY. BEYOND THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE MODELS INDICATE UPPER FLOW 
BECOMING ZONAL BY WEDNESDAY WITH AMPLIFICATION OCCURRING THURSDAY 
INTO FRIDAY. SO IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER RETURN TO IMPROVED WEATHER 
WITH TEMPERATURES MODERATING MID TO LATE WEEK. STAYED RELATIVELY 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
THE UPPER LOW OVER VA/NC WILL TRACK EAST TONIGHT. A TROUGH EXTENDING 
NW ACROSS THE TN AND OH VALLEY REGION TODAY WILL MOVE SOUTH OF THE 
AREA THIS EVENING. CLEARING IS EXPECTED BEHIND THIS TROUGH...AS SEEN 
IN VIS SAT ACROSS OH AND NRN KY. WITH SURFACE MOISTURE FROM EARLIER 
RAINFALL AND CLEARING SKIES...FOG POTENTIAL LOOKS GOOD. A BUILDING 
SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD ALSO LEAD TO CALM WINDS BY MIDNIGHT. AREAS OF 
FOG WILL BE MENTIONS AREAWIDE...WITH FREEZING FOG ACROSS THE NORTH 
AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. PATCHY BLACK ICE MAY ALSO DEVELOP...AND WILL 
ISSUE A SPS TO ADDRESS THIS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN THE UPPER 20S 
TO LOWER 30S NORTH...WITH MID 30S CENTRAL AND SOUTH. THURSDAY LOOKS 
DRY AND SUNNY AS A HIGH AMPLITUDE RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE REGION. 
HIGHS WILL BE IN THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS. 

LONG TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE BUILD OVER THE REGION FROM THURSDAY NIGHT
INTO SUNDAY...SO DRY WEATHER WITH SLOWLY RISING TEMPERATURES LOOKS
PROMISING. JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR THOSE
PERIODS...PLUS 7/12Z GFSX MOS WAS VERY CLOSE TO 7/00Z MOS.

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING EAST INTO THE 
REGION MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...WITH VERY GOOD AGREEMENT AMONGST 
THE AVAILABLE MODELS. I NUDGED POPS UP TO LIKELY OVER WRN AREAS 
MONDAY NIGHT AND RAISED ERN POPS TO A HIGHER CHANCE. THE LATEST 
CANADIAN MODEL RUN HAS BACKED OFF ON THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO 
SEVERE STORMS...AND LOOKS VERY MUCH LIKE THE GFS AND ECMWF NOW.
TRACK OF THE SURFACE LOW AND DYNAMICS LOOK TO BE WELL TO OUR 
NORTHWEST. GRIDS LOOKED GOOD FOR TUESDAY AND I INTRODUCED WEDNESDAY 
AS DRY FOR NOW. REMAINDER OF GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE CLOSE TO PREVIOUS

SHORT WAVE CONTINUES SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. 
RELATIVELY STRONG SYSTEM WITH ADEQUATE MOISTURE SHOULD BRING SOME 
LIGHT RAIN ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND ACROSS SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE LATER THIS EVENING WITH LIGHT PRECIP EXPANDING ACROSS MUCH 
OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE TOO WARM AT LOW ELEVATION FOR PRECIP TO FALL IN THE FORM 
OF SNOW. HOWEVER...MODELS SHOW 85H TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO FREEZING 
OR JUST BELOW LATE TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. SO WE SHOULD SEE 
SOME RAIN MIX WITH AND LIKELY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW AT VERY HIGH 
ELEVATIONS ALONG THE TENNESSEE-NORTH CAROLINA BORDER (4000 FT AND 
ABOVE). WOULDN'T EXPECT MORE THAN ONE INCH ACCUMULATION AT THIS 
POINT. THE LIGHT RAIN MAY HANG AROUND THROUGH MUCH OF THE MORNING 
AND EXTEND INTO THE AFTERNOON AS THE BACK EDGE WRAPS UP ACROSS THE 
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. MET MOS LOOKS 
UNREALISTICALLY WARM FOR MAX TEMPS ON WEDNESDAY WITH CLOUDS AND 
PRECIP IN THE AREA SO WENT MUCH CLOSER TO THE COLDER MAV 
NUMBERS.     

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH 
PRESSURE...SURFACE AND ALOFT MOVES SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE AREA 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. H85 TEMPS RISE NORTH OF 10C. PWATS FALL SOUTH 
OF .50. LARGE DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGE WITH COOL MORNINGS AND WARM 
AFTERNOON. NEXT COLD FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH LATE MONDAY. 
CONVECTIVE CHANCES LOOK GOOD AS SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH QUICKLY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...OZARKS SHORT WAVE TROUGH ON 
THE MOVE THIS AFTERNOON SPREADING SOME ALTO CU AND CIRRUS INTO THE 
REGION. THE WAVE DIVES SOUTHEAST TONIGHT AND SHOULD BE POSITIONED 
NEAR THE EXTREME SOUTHERN EXTENT OF THE APPALACHIANS ALONG THE 
ALABAMA/GEORGIA BORDER BY 12Z TUESDAY. THE PROBLEM WITH THIS SYSTEM 
IS IT WILL NOT HAVE ENOUGH MOISTURE AVAILABLE...ESPECIALLY AROUND 
85H AND BELOW...FOR PRECIPITATION PRODUCTION. IT LOOKS LIKE A LIGHT 
RAIN EVENT IMPACTING MAINLY SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA CLOSER TO THE BETTER LIFT AND HIGHER MEAN RELATIVE 
HUMIDITY. TIGHT POP GRADIENT PROGGED BY THE MODELS FROM SOUTH TO 
NORTH ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY LOOKS GOOD SO STAYED THE COURSE HERE 
WITH VERY LITTLE CHANCE OF MEASURABLE PRECIP ACROSS NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THE FEATURE MOVES AWAY FROM THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY TUESDAY WITH MUCH OF THE AREA DRY BY 
THE AFTERNOON. STAYED CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR TEMPERATURES 
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.

MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING HAS
HELPED TEMPERATURES FALL INTO THE 30S ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION.

THERE WAS A POTENT SHORTWAVE SPINNING ACROSS NORTHWESTERN MISSOURI 
THIS MORNING. IN RESPONSE...HIGH CLOUDS WERE SPREADING ACROSS 
WESTERN KENTUCKY...NORTHERN ARKANSAS AND WESTERN TENNESSEE. DAYTIME 
TEMPERATURES AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN

THIS AFTERNOON. MODEL FORECASTS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT TAKING 
IT AS FAR SOUTH AS BIRMINGHAM. THE LIGHT RAIN THAT IS EXPECTED TO 
OCCUR OVER THE REGION SHOULD BE CONFINED TO AREAS GENERALLY SOUTH OF 
I-40. 

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
A DEEPENING UPPER-TROUGH SWINGING THROUGH NORTHERN ALABAMA/GEORGIA
WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE REGION
ON TUESDAY...PARTICULARLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
NORTH CAROLINA...WITH SOME ISOLATED ACTIVITY MORE LIKELY NORTH OF
THE I-40 CORRIDOR...PARTICULARLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AS PRECIP
CHANCES BEGIN TO WANE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. HOWEVER...A SECONDARY
UPPER-WAVE WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL GIVE THE AREA ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SOME
SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES OVERNIGHT...
BEFORE DIMINISHING AND BECOMING MORE CONFINED TO THE MOUNTAINS OF
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.

COOL CONDITIONS WILL ALSO PREVAIL THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AS 
HIGHS WILL PEAK INTO THE 40S AND 50S ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. 
HOWEVER...WARMER AND DRIER CONDITIONS WILL BEGIN BY THURSDAY AS 
THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT INCREASE IN RESPONSE TO AN
UPPER-RIDGE AXIS BUILDING INTO THE FORECAST AREA HEADING INTO

HAS RETURNED ACROSS THE VALLEY COUNTIES AND SW NC THIS AFTERNOON.
MEANWHILE...LOW CLOUDS HAVE BEEN MUCH SLOWER TO ERODE OVER THE
FOOTHILLS...NRN PLATEAU AND NRN PARTS OF SW VA. THE CLOUDS AND SNOW
COVER OVER WISE COUNTY HAVE REALLY KEPT A LID ON MAX TEMP THERE.
LOW CLOUDS MAY FORM AGAIN TONIGHT ALONG WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE IN
HIGH CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. THUS...WILL RUN PARTLY TO
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT. CLOUDS AND LIGHT WINDS DON'T REALLY
FAVOR FOG OR FROST...BUT I ADDED PATCHY MENTION WHERE MIN TEMPS
FALL ENOUGH.

DRY FOR MONDAY WITH CLOUDS INCREASING BY LATE AFTERNOON. ANY
PRECIPITATION HOLDS OFF UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT...WITH NRN AREAS LOOKING
TO POSSIBLY MISS OUT FROM THE DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TO OUR
WEST. I LOWERED POPS ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN...AND MIDNIGHT SHIFT
MAY BE ABLE TO DROP POPS COMPLETELY OVER THESE AREAS FOR BOTH LATE
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. 

THE LIFT APPEARS TO BE ISENTROPIC WHICH WOULD BE MORE RAIN THAN
SHOWERS...BUT NOT A REAL SIGNIFICANT POINT...SO KEPT AS RAIN
SHOWERS IN MOST AREAS. OTHERWISE...MOS TEMPS WERE CLOSE FOR THESE
PERIODS AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED...EXCEPT TO UNDERCUT HIGHS OVER WISE
COUNTY. 


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...FIRST PART OF THE

HEALTHY AMOUNT OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF THE

NIGHT THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY AND POSSIBLY INTO THE EVENING HOURS
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. NICE SHOT OF MOISTURE WITH THE SHORT WAVE SYSTEMS
AND NORTHWESTERLY UPSLOPE COMPONENT TO ENHANCE PRECIP IN THE
TERRAIN. LOOKS LIKE LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS WITH A SNOW SHOWER OR TWO
MIXED INTO THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS WELL
AS THE TENNESSEE-NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AS COLDER AIR SPILLS SOUTH
TOWARD WEDNESDAY MORNING AND CONTINUES THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING
BEHIND THE SLOWLY DEPARTING NORTHEASTERN U.S. STORM SYSTEM. IT
COULD BE A SLOW GO BUT EVENTUALLY A NICE BIG UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL
MAKE ITS WAY EAST THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK WITH THE RIDGE AXIS
OVER THE APPALACHIANS AROUND SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. SUBSIDENCE AND
DRYING IN THE RIDGE PATTERN COULD KEEP THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY
PRECIP FREE AWAITING A FRONTAL SYSTEM DUE INTO THE AREA ON MONDAY.
ADJUSTED MEX MOS TEMPERATURES BACK SEVERAL DEGREES EARLY IN THE

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH HAS BROUGHT A WARM AND HUMID AIR
MASS INTO THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS LOW PRESSURE
AREA IS PROGGED TO MOVE EASTWARD INTO THE CAROLINAS TODAY...WITH
CLOUDS LIKELY LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE DAY
BEHIND THIS SYSTEM DUE TO AN UPPER- LEVEL SHORT WAVE DIGGING OVER
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THIS SHORT WAVE SHOULD GRADUALLY MOVE
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE EVENING HOURS...BUT ADDITIONAL
HIGH CLOUDS IN ADVANCE OF ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE
CENTRAL PLAINS WILL LIKELY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA AFTER
MIDNIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER NUMBERS
WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD WAS TO DIAGNOSE 
PRECIP CHANCES THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK. AN 
INTENSIFYING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL BE PUSHING SOUTH FROM THE
MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO NORTHERN ALABAMA/GEORGIA BY 12Z
TUESDAY. INCREASED MOISTURE AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM AND THE ASSOCIATED
SYNOPTIC LIFT WILL PROVIDE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SCATTERED
SHOWERS FAVORING THE SOUTHERN ZONES MONDAY NIGHT AND THE MOUNTAIN
ZONES ON TUESDAY ALONG THE NORTHERN/WESTERN SIDE OF THE LOW AS IT
TRACKS SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. A SECONDARY UPPER-WAVE WILL THEN
DROP SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY NIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY...PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL LIFT FOR SOME LIGHT SHOWERS
AREAWIDE OVERNIGHT AND POTENTIALLY THROUGHOUT THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY
ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES...BEFORE CLEARING BEGINS TO OCCUR
FROM WEST TO EAST BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. IT SHOULD ALSO BE
NOTED THAT IT MAY BE COLD ENOUGH IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR SOME
LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS TO MIX WITH THE RAIN OR CHANGE OVER TO ALL SNOW
LATE MONDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHTS...THOUGH MINOR TO NO ACCUMULATIONS
ARE EXPECTED. THEREAFTER...A WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR...ALONG WITH
CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS AS AN UPPER SUBTROPICAL RIDGE BUILDS BACK
INTO THE REGION THURSDAY INTO THE WEEKEND.

AL INTO NW GA. HOWEVER...MOST SHOWERS ARE STILL OVER NRN KY NORTH
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY REGION...AND CURRENT DEW POINT TEMPS ARE QUITE
A BIT BELOW MOS GUIDANCE VALUES THIS AFTERNOON. OPTED TO SLOW DOWN
THE ARRIVAL OF SHOWERS SOMEWHAT...BUT KEPT A SWATH OF LOW LIKELY
OVER NRN AREAS EARLY TONIGHT. THUNDER/LIGHTNING HAS BEEN ABSENT AND
WAS NOT ADDED TO FORECAST GRIDS. GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO GFS MOS
FOR MIN TEMPS TONIGHT.

A FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER INTO SUNDAY MORNING ACROSS E AND SE AREAS
WITH A FEW ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO DROP THE POPS EARLIER ACROSS THE NRN
PLATEAU AND WISE/LEE COUNTIES OF SW VA. CLOUDS MAY BREAK UP MORE
THAN FORECAST GRIDS REFLECT...SO WILL GO CLOSER TO THE MILDER GFS
MAX TEMPS FOR SUNDAY.

SURFACE RIDGE DROPS IN FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...WITH NW FLOW
ALOFT. KEEPING THE FORECAST DRY AS EARLIER FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND
MONDAY. LITTLE CHANGES MADE TO THOSE GRIDS FOR NOW.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS BASICALLY 
CONTINUE SCENARIO OF DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH DIVING INTO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE 
LOW PRESSURE SHIFTING NORTHEAST FROM NORTHERN FLORIDA ALONG AN 
EASTERN SEABOARD PATH. STILL LOOKS LIKE JUST CHANCE POPS FOR SOME 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP TUESDAY NIGHT WITH TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
DROPPING INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE DEEP EASTERN U.S. LONG WAVE 
SYSTEM. PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT GRADUALLY TRANSITIONS TO 
WESTERLY AS A NICE AMPLIFIED RIDGE EXPANDS EAST TOWARD THE REGION. 
HAD TO ADJUST MEX MOS TEMPS BACK JUST A BIT THROUGH MUCH OF THE

STRONG AND SLOW MOVING EASTERN U.S. STORM SYSTEM.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL

TUESDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER OPPORTUNITY FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS /AND 
SOME ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS IN THE SMOKIES LATE MONDAY NIGHT/ TO THE

.DISCUSSION...BLANKET OF CLOUDS KEPT MANY AREAS IN THE 40S 
OVERNIGHT. THESE CLOUDS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE MOVING THROUGH THE REGION. SATELLITE PICS SHOW THE CLOUDS 
ALREADY DECREASING WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON. 
12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW SOME MILD AIR AT 850 MB LEVEL...WITH 12Z 
OHX SOUNDING EASILY SUPPORTING AS WARM AS 60S TO AROUND 70 FOR HIGHS 
ACROSS WRN AND SRN AREAS. 

FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK...BUT I PLAN TO FRESHEN THE GRIDS AND ALL 
PRODUCTS BEFORE NOON.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN INDIANA...WITH A 
DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS LOW PRESSURE AREA IS 
PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION THIS MORNING...BRINGING MAINLY JUST SOME CLOUDS 
FOR THE MORNING HOURS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD INTO THE REGION 
THIS AFTERNOON...BRINGING LIGHT WINDS AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
THROUGH TONIGHT. TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO FALL INTO THE 30S TONIGHT... 
WHICH MAY ALLOW SOME FROST TO DEVELOP IN THE VALLEYS TOWARDS 
SUNRISE. IT APPEARS THAT HIGH CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM MAY MOVE OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT IN THE NORTHWEST 
FLOW ALOFT...SO WILL ONLY MENTION PATCHY FROST FOR NOW...AND WILL 
HOLD OFF ON ANY FROST ADVISORIES. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSING 
ALONG THE GULF COAST STATES WILL HELP TO PUSH A FRONT INTO THE AREA 
ON SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY...INCREASING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS BEGINNING 
LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING IN THE NORTHERN ZONES AND DROPPING 
SOUTHWARD OVERNIGHT THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE REGION...BEFORE 
FINALLY TAPERING OFF SOMETIME ON SUNDAY. THERE ARE STILL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES WITH THE TIMING OF THE PRECIPITATION EXITING THE 
AREA...WITH THE NAM DRYING OFF SUNDAY MORNING AND THE GFS KEEPING 
SOME REASONABLE QPF SIGNALS THOUGH THE ENTIRE DAY. AS A RESULT... 
HAVE OPTED TO GO WITH HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS SATURDAY NIGHT IN MOST 
AREAS AND THEN CHANCE POPS IN MOST AREAS /EXCEPT THE FAR NORTHERN 
ZONES/ ON SUNDAY FOR NOW AND WILL WAIT FOR SLIGHTLY BETTER MODEL 
CONTINUITY BEFORE MAKING ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THIS PERIOD. 

THEREAFTER...AN UPPER TROUGH DRIVES SOUTHWARD FROM THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS INTO THE SOUTHEAST U.S. AND INTENSIFIES...BRINGING THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWERS /AND SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS DURING EARLY TUESDAY MORNING/ MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY. GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS ON TIMING AND HOW 
FAR THE LOW WILL TRACK...HAVE OPTED TO KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
NOW. HOWEVER IF TRENDS CONTINUE...AN INCREASE IN POPS WILL BE 
WARRANTED DURING THE EARLY/MIDDLE PART OF THE WORK WEEK. 

COOL CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD...WITH HIGHS 
TOPPING OFF IN THE 50S TO LOW 60S FROM THE LATE WEEKEND THOUGH MOST 
OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK. HOWEVER...A GRADUAL WARMING TREND IS 
EXPECTED BY NEXT WEEKEND AS AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS BUILDS OVERHEAD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...LOW CLOUDS JUST ABOUT ERODED 
OVER EXTREME NE PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. THIS 
REVEALS AN INTERESTING SNOW PATTERN ON VISIBLE SATELLITE PICS...WITH 
SNOW COVERING THE SMOKIES...HIGHEST TERRAIN OVER UNICOI/CARTER AND 
JOHNSON COUNTIES OF NE TN...AND ALSO OVER NWRN PARTS OF WISE COUNTY 
VA. 

STILL UNDER NW FLOW ALOFT ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE REMNANTS OF SANDY
WITH MODELS SHOWING A FAST MOVING DISTURBANCE TO DROP SE FROM THE 
OHIO VALLEY...MOVING ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS OVERNIGHT. THIS 
WILL BRING INCREASING MID TO LOW CLOUDS TONIGHT...BUT NOT WORTH MORE 
THAN A MENTION OF SPRINKLES ACROSS SW VA COUNTIES. THESE CLOUDS AND 
SOME LIGHT WESTERLY WINDS SEEM MORE SUPPORTIVE OF THE MILDER GFS MOS 
MINS. 

SUNSHINE RETURNS ON FRIDAY WITH CLOUDS DECREASING FROM SW TO NE. A 
BIT BREEZY WITH SIMILAR MOS MAX TEMPS WHICH WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED. 
SRN AREAS AND OTHER AREAS WITH NO SNOW COVER SHOULD ACTUALLY WARM TO 
A COUPLE OF DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN SYSTEM DURING
THE EXTENDED FORECAST WILL BE A SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-
WAVES MOVING ACROSS THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY.
SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FOR LATE SATURDAY AND
SUNDAY PRODUCING HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY RAIN SHOWERS. MAIN FORCING WILL
BE ISENTROPIC LIFT AND FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG A WEAK FRONTAL
BOUNDARY. 

TIMING OF NORTHERN STREAM WAVE IS UNCERTAIN WITH DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS. WILL GO WITH THE GFS...BUT
CONFIDENCE IS LOW. ALBERTA-LIKE SYSTEM WILL MOVE QUICKLY ACROSS THE
AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY PRODUCING A SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE OF
SHOWERS. LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE WARMER THAN YESTERDAY'S SO CHANCES
OF SNOW IS VERY LIMITED. MAIN FORCING IS Q-G FORCING AND ISENTROPIC
LIFT. 

FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...FORECAST AREA WILL BE UNDER DRY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SHORT RANGE MODELS SUGGEST
ANOTHER SURGE OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO MOVE ACROSS SW VA AND
EXTREME NE TN OVERNIGHT...ALONG WITH ANOTHER SHOT OF VORTICITY AND
LINGERING LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW. SATELLITE PICS SUPPORT THIS
UPSTREAM...SO I INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND POPS ACROSS THESE AREAS
BUT KEPT POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY OR LOWER...AS ANY ADDITIONAL
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS LOOK TO BE MAINLY TRACE TO LESS THAN 1/2 INCH AT
BEST OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF RUSSELL AND WISE COUNTIES OF SW VA. 

THE FREEZE WATCH WAS UPGRADED TO A WARNING FOR ALL BUT NE TN...
WHERE LINGERING CLOUDS AND SOME WESTERLY WINDS SHOULD KEEP MINS IN
THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 30S. EXPECTING A BROAD AREA OF UPPER 20S TO
LOWER 30S ACROSS THE FREEZE WARNING AREA...WHERE FREEZING TEMPS HAD
YET TO OCCUR THIS FALL.

SOME FLURRIES ARE POSSIBLE BRIEFLY THURSDAY MORNING OVER SW VA AND
NE TIP OF TN. OTHERWISE...SUNSHINE RETURNING BUT MAX TEMPS WILL
LIKELY BE AFFECTED BY SNOW COVER OVER THE HIGHEST TERRAIN. MY MAX
TEMPS WERE CREATED TO REFLECT THIS DIFFERENCE...BUT MID SHIFT MAY
NEED TO ADJUST A BIT MORE. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FOR THURSDAY 
NIGHT...ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS 
BRING AN AREA OF LOW CLOUDS BACK ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE...AND
THEN MOVE OUT OF THE AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON. SPRINKLES OR 
FLURRIES (HIGHER ELEVATIONS) POSSIBLE...OTHERWISE DRY.

UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGING BUILDS IN FOR SATURDAY WITH WARMER 
TEMPERATURES AND DRY CONDITIONS.

FOR SUNDAY...A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE WILL QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS 
THE AREA WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AREA-WIDE. LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED 
TO INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY...BUT TIMING AND STRENGTH OF WAVE ARE 
UNCERTAIN. FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...A NORTHERN STREAM SHORT TROUGH WILL 
DIVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS SYSTEM IS 
SIMILAR TO AN ALBERTA CLIPPER WITH DECENT Q-G FORCING AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM. AFTER TROUGH AXIS MOVES EAST...THEN NORTHWEST ORGOGRAPHIC 
FLOW WILL KICK-IN. TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR 
MOUNTAIN SNOWFALL. WENT A CAT OR SO COLDER THAN GUIDANCE MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY DUE TO THE COLD AIR ADVECTION AND PRECIPITATION.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
THE LARGE/INTENSE UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM THAT IS THE REMNANTS OF
HURRICANE SANDY WILL CONTINUE TO IMPACT THE REGION OVERNIGHT...
PRODUCING MODERATE TO PERHAPS LOCALLY HEAVY SNOWFALL ACROSS THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE...AND
SOME GUSTY NORTHWEST WINDS THROUGH THIS EVENING. IT HAS BEEN A
RECORD SETTING SNOWFALL FOR SOME LOCATIONS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AS
TOTALS BETWEEN 18-24+ INCHES HAVE BEEN REPORTED AT HIGH KNOB IN
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND AT MT LECONTE AND NEWFOUND GAP IN THE GREAT
SMOKY MOUNTAINS. OTHER LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR
NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE HAVE RECEIVED AROUND 3-6 INCHES...WITH SOME
SPOTS GETTING AS MUCH AS 6-12 INCHES ALONG THE SLIGHTLY HIGHER
ELEVATIONS BETWEEN 3000-4000 FEET.

THERE CONTINUES TO BE SOME BANDS OF GENERALLY LIGHT TO MODERATE
PRECIPITATION MOVING SOUTHWARD THROUGH EASTERN KENTUCKY AND INTO
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE LATE THIS AFTERNOON...AND
THIS IS EXPECTED TO LINGER OVERNIGHT...THOUGH ITS COVERAGE AND
INTENSITY SHOULD WANE A BIT WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS. STILL...AN ADDITIONAL 3-6 INCHES IS NOT OUT OF THE
QUESTION FOR THE AREA MOUNTAINS...ESPECIALLY THOSE LOCATIONS ABOVE
4000-5000 FEET...WITH ADDITIONAL LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE TO
AROUND 1500-2500 FT DEPENDING ON HOW LOW THE MELTING LEVEL DROPS
DOWN TO OVERNIGHT. GIVEN THAT THIS SNOWFALL HAS BEEN EXTREMELY
ELEVATION DEPENDENT...MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL EXPERIENCE LIGHT
TO LOCALIZED MODERATE BURSTS OF RAINFALL...AND RECEIVE NO SNOWFALL
ACCUMULATIONS. THUS...HAVE DECIDED TO CANCEL THE WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY FOR THE FOR NORTHERN ZONES GIVEN THE EXPECTED LACK OF
SNOWFALL POTENTIAL IN THIS AREA. HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER
STORM WARNING THROUGH 12Z TOMORROW MORNING FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
AND THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND WILL KEEP THE WIND ADVISORY
THERE AS WELL THROUGH 00Z TONIGHT.

BY TOMORROW...SOME LINGERING LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER
TERRAIN ARE STILL EXPECTED...BUT ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE VER LIGHT AS
THIS STORM SYSTEM PULLS AWAY FROM THE REGION. CLOUD COVER SHOULD
BEGIN TO BREAK UP SOMEWHAT AS WELL BY THE LATE AFTERNOON AS
TEMPERATURES WARM UP JUST A TAD AS WELL.

HOWEVER...IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS STILL A DANGEROUS
SITUATION IN THE WARNED AREA AS SOME SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL HAS
OCCURRED AND WILL CONTINUE ACCUMULATE OVERNIGHT...CREATING SOME
DANGEROUS TRAVEL CONDITIONS IN THOSE HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS...
PARTICULARLY AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING. THOSE WITH TRAVEL PLANS
SHOULD CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE LATEST FORECAST INFORMATION AND BE
PREPARED FOR RAPIDLY CHANGING WEATHER CONDITIONS IN THE HIGHER
TERRAIN THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/... 
THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...AND MOISTURE DEPTH WILL BE RAPIDLY DECREASING. WILL HAVE A
SLIGHT CHANCE POP NEAR OUR NORTHERN BORDER WEDNESDAY EVENING...WITH
ALL PRECIP OVER AROUND MIDNIGHT. LOW TEMPS THURSDAY MORNING MAY
DROP BELOW FREEZING ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA...THE FIRST HARD FREEZE
FOR VALLEY LOCATIONS. BUILDING HEIGHTS ALOFT AND DRY ADVECTION WILL
PROVIDE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND GRADUALLY WARMING TEMPS FOR THURSDAY
THROUGH SATURDAY. HIGH TEMPS WILL REACH INTO THE 60S IN MOST SPOTS
BY SATURDAY.

MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON A CLOSED LOW TRACKING FROM THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS SATURDAY NIGHT TO NEW ENGLAND BY TUESDAY. THIS SYSTEM PUSHES 
A COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA ON SUNDAY NIGHT. THERE ARE SOME 
DISCREPANCIES WITH THE TIMING AMONG THE MODELS...AND THERE IS 
CONSIDERABLE SPREAD IN GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. WILL HAVE LOW TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY.

1134 AM EDT TUE OCT 30 2012

.DISCUSSION...
THE LARGE/INTENSE UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM THAT IS THE REMNANTS OF
HURRICANE SANDY CONTINUES TO BARREL THROUGH THE CENTRAL
APPALACHIANS AND WILL PRODUCE IMPACTS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT...BEFORE PULLING AWAY FROM
THE REGION BY TOMORROW. SOME VERY HEAVY SNOWFALL HAS ALREADY
OCCURRED ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE
EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS WHERE BETWEEN 12-18 INCHES HAS BEEN
REPORTED. SOME LOWER ELEVATION AREAS DOWN TO 2000-2500 FEET OR SO
HAVE RECEIVED SOME MEANINGFUL SNOWFALL AS WELL AROUND 3-6 INCHES
ACROSS PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR NORTHEASTERN
TENNESSEE...WITH WISE/NORTON RECEIVING 8 INCHES AS OF MID MORNING.

IT APPEARS AS THOUGH A TROWAL FEATURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS STORM
SYSTEM WILL GRADUALLY MOVE SOUTHWARD INTO THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES
TODAY...PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL LIFT FOR SOME LIGHT TO MODERATE
PRECIPITATION. THIS IS ALREADY BEING OBSERVED ON RADAR IN
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS SOME HEAVIER BANDS CONTINUE TO MOVE SOUTH
FROM WEST VIRGINIA AND EASTERN KENTUCKY. AS A RESULT...SOME LOCALLY
MODERATE TO HEAVY SNOWS ARE EXPECTED ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF
THE SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE WHERE AN ADDITIONAL 6-10
INCHES COULD ACCUMULATE ALONG THE HIGHEST PEAKS BY THIS EVENING.
THE SNOWFALL HAS BEEN VERY MUCH TIED TO THE MELTING LEVEL WHICH HAS
HELD STEADY AT 2200 FT OR SO OVERNIGHT AND INTO THIS MORNING.
THEREFORE...MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL CONTINUE TO EXPERIENCE LIGHT
RAIN SHOWERS AND LITTLE TO NO SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. HOWEVER...SOME
WET BULB COOLING LATER TODAY/TONIGHT COULD RESULT IN THE MELTING
LEVEL DROPPING SOME...AND ALLOWING SOME ADDITIONAL AREAS TO PICK UP
A DUSTING TO MAYBE AN INCH OF SNOW IN THE ADVISORY AREAS ACROSS THE
FAR NORTHERN ZONES. MOST LOCATIONS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY...THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WILL RECEIVE
NO SNOWFALL HOWEVER.

A WINTER STORM WARNING WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE THROUGH 12Z
WEDNESDAY. A WIND ADVISORY WILL ALSO REMAIN IN EFFECT FOR THESE
AREAS THROUGH 00Z THIS EVENING. THE WIND ADVISORY WAS CANCELLED FOR
THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA AS WINDS SHOULD BE WEAKER THAN
INITIALLY EXPECTED AND REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE DAY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE CENTER OF POST-TROPICAL CYCLONE 
SANDY OVER SOUTHERN NEW JERSEY...WITH A COLD AIR MASS LINGERING OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. A STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT REMAINS OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BETWEEN SANDY AND A LARGE DOME OF HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...BUT WIND SPEEDS 
HAVE BEEN BELOW WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA THIS EVENING IN THE GREAT TN 
VALLEY. WITH THE CENTER OF SANDY EXPECTED TO MOVE WEST-SOUTHWEST TO 
THE PANHANDLE OF MARYLAND BY SUNRISE...WILL CONTINUE THE WIND 
ADVISORIES OVERNIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME HIGHER 
WIND GUSTS TOWARDS SUNRISE. EARLIER REPORTS FROM THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS HAVE ALREADY INDICATED THAT 4 TO 10 INCHES OF SNOW HAS 
ACCUMULATED ABOVE 2500 FEET. THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER WX 
WARNINGS/ADVISORIES WITH THE SAME FORECASTED AMOUNTS...SINCE DEEPER 
MOISTURE IS EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT AS 
SANDY GETS A LITTLE CLOSER.

.AVIATION...POWERFUL STORM SYSTEM PRESSURE CENTER APPEARS TO BE
BUILDING OVER THE NEW JERSEY COAST AT THIS TIME AND LIFT HAS BEEN
GRADUALLY STRENGTHENING ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION WITH LIGHT RAIN TRYING TO MIX WITH LIGHT SNOW NEAR THE TN/VA
BORDER IN THE VICINITY OF TRI. THEREFORE...APPLIED A LIGHT MIXED
PRECIP HERE FOR SEVERAL HOURS. LIGHT SNOW WILL BE MORE LIKELY
LATER TONIGHT WITH VSBY IN THE HIGH END RANGE OF MVFR. EXPECT VERY
LIGHT RAIN TO MIX WITH A FEW FLAKES OF SNOW AT TYS TOWARD DAYBREAK
AS LIFT STRENGTHENS AND MOISTURE IN THE ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN DEEPENS.
IT WILL BE DURING THIS PERIOD (APPROXIMATELY 12Z-20Z) WHEN FLIGHT
CONDITIONS SHOULD BE AT THEIR LOWEST AT BOTH TRI AND TYS. EXPECT A
MIXTURE OF LIGHT SNOW AND RAIN AT TRI THROUGH ABOUT MID DAY BEFORE
TRANSITIONING BACK TO ONLY RAIN. THIS SHOULD HAPPEN MUCH EARLIER AT
TYS. THE OTHER FEATURE TO BE AWARE OF WILL BE THE HEALTHY WESTERLY
FLOW AT AROUND 15-18 KNOTS WITH GUSTS AROUND 20-30 KNOTS DURING THE

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
312 PM EDT MON OCT 29 2012

.SHORT TERM...
AN INTENSIFYING UPPER-LEVEL LOW HAS PUSHED SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND IS BEGINNING TO INTERACT WITH LANDFALLING
HURRICANE SANDY ACROSS THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. BOTH OF THESE
SYSTEMS WILL MORPH INTO ONE LARGE...INTENSE UPPER-LEVER STORM
SYSTEM THAT WILL IMPACT THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. THROUGHOUT LAST NIGHT INTO TODAY...LIGHT
RAIN/SNOW HAS FALLEN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA...WITH SOME MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVIER BURSTS OF
SNOWFALL OCCURRING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS...PARTICULARLY
THOSE ABOVE 5000 FT WHERE REPORTS OF AROUND HALF A FOOT OF SNOW
LOCALLY AT HIGH KNOB...NEWFOUND GAP AND MT LECONTE HAVE ALREADY
BEEN REPORTED. THIS POINTS TO THE POTENTIAL FOR EVEN GREATER
SNOWFALL IN THESE AREAS THAN EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS
AFTER A PLUME OF DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE ARRIVES LATER THIS EVENING
INTO TUESDAY.

THERE ARE A COUPLE OF FEATURES OF NOTE THAT MAKE THIS EVENT 
DIFFERENT FROM A TYPICAL NORTHWEST FLOW CASE IN THAT THERE WILL BE A
PLUME OF DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE ACROSS THE REGION THAT WILL
INTERACT WITH THE COLD AIRMASS IN PLACE. THIS...COMBINED WITH SOME
UPPER-LEVEL SYNOPTIC LIFT FROM A TROWAL FEATURE ROTATING AROUND THE
BACKSIDE OF THE SYSTEM AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL RESULT IN THE
POTENTIAL FOR SOME VERY HEAVY SNOWFALL ACROSS THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS...PARTICULARLY TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS MOISTURE/LIFT
REALLY RAMPS UP. IT SHOULD ALSO BE NOTED THAT MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE
TRENDING COLDER IN THE VALLEY LOCATIONS...WHICH WOULD RESULT IN A
GREATER POTENTIAL FOR ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS
ACROSS FAR NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND ALONG NORTHERN PORTIONS OF
THE PLATEAU AS WELL /ESPECIALLY WITH WET-BULB COOLING TAKING PLACE
AS IT STARTS TO PRECIPITATE/. GIVEN ALL THIS...HAVE OPTED TO
MAINTAIN THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY ACROSS THE FAR NORTHERN AND
NORTHEAST ZONES THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR 1-2
INCHES OF SNOW /WITH SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS/ ACROSS THESE
AREAS.

THE BIG CONCERN WILL BE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE HEAVY 
SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE...PARTICULARLY ABOVE 3000 FT WHERE BETWEEN
4-12 INCHES COULD ACCUMULATE...WITH EVEN HIGHER AMOUNTS FURTHER UP
INTO THE 4000-6000 FT RANGE WHERE BETWEEN 1-2+ FEET IS NOT OUT OF
THE QUESTION. SOME OF THE TALLEST PEAKS IN THE SMOKIES MAY APPROACH
30 INCHES BEFORE THINGS TAPER OFF ON WEDNESDAY AS THE STORM SYSTEM
MOVES TO THE NORTH. GIVEN ALL THIS...WILL STICK WITH THE WINTER
STORM WARNING FOR ALL OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE EAST TENNESSEE
MOUNTAINS THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY.

A TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT OVERNIGHT WILL PRODUCE NORTHWEST 
WINDS IN THE ADVISORY RANGE BEGINNING TONIGHT AND CONTINUING THROUGH 
TUESDAY. VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL BE TOWARD THE LOW END OF THE ADVISORY 
RANGE (20-30 MPH)...WITH ELEVATIONS AT OR ABOVE 3000 FT NEAR THE 
HIGH END (35-40 MPH). WITH THIS AMOUNT OF WIND AND SNOWFALL...
BLIZZARD CONDITIONS APPEAR LIKELY...ESPECIALLY ON HIGH KNOB IN WISE
COUNTY. WILL CHANGE WISE TO A BZ.W. FOR THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS...
WILL MENTION BLIZZARD CONDITIONS POSSIBLE AT TIMES IN THE WARNING
WORDING...BUT KEEP AS A WS.W FOR THE SAKE OF CONTINUITY WITH
EASTERN NEIGHBORS.

IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THIS IS A RARE AND DANGEROUS SITUATION FOR

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1041 AM EDT MON OCT 29 2012

.DISCUSSION...
A RARE EARLY SEASON WINTER WEATHER STORM IS BEGINNING TO COME
TOGETHER ACROSS THE EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS
THIS MORNING. AN INTENSIFYING UPPER-LOW HAS MOVED SOUTHWARD OVER THE
REGION AND WILL BEGIN TO INTERACT WITH LANDFALLING HURRICANE SANDY
LATER TODAY ACROSS THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. LIGHT
PRECIPITATION CONTINUES TO FALL ACROSS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...GENERALLY HUGGING THE HIGHER
TERRAIN...WHERE TEMPERATURES ABOVE 2500-3000 FT ARE AT OR BELOW
FREEZING AND HAVE BEEN RECEIVING LIGHT TO MODERATE BURSTS OF
SNOWFALL SINCE LATE YESTERDAY EVENING. INCREDIBLY...BEFORE THE DEEP
MOISTURE FROM SANDY HAS EVEN ARRIVED...WE HAVE RECEIVED REPORTS OF
4-5 INCHES OF SNOW AT NEWFOUND GAP IN GSMNP AND AT HIGH KNOB IN
WISE COUNTY VA AS OF 10 AM EDT. WHILE THESE AMOUNTS ARE VERY
LOCALIZED AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...IT POINTS TO THE POTENTIAL FOR
EVEN GREATER SNOWFALL IN THESE AREAS THAN EXPECTED FOR LATER THIS
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT WHEN THE DEEP MOISTURE FINALLY DOES ARRIVE.

FOR TODAY THOUGH...CLOUD COVER AND SCATTERED LIGHT PRECIPITATION
WILL PERSIST ACROSS THE MUCH OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA...AND ALONG THE SPINE OF THE SMOKIES. LATE IN THE
AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING THIS PRECIPITATION COULD BECOME MORE
WIDESPREAD AS LIFT/MOISTURE INCREASES. ADDITIONALLY...IT SHOULD BE
NOTED THAT THE NAM-12 ALONG WITH THE GFS ARE NOW TRENDING SLIGHTLY
COLDER IN THE VALLEYS...WHICH MAY ALLOW /ESPECIALLY WITH WET-BULB
COOLING OCCURRING/...FOR SOME SNOW TO MIX WITH THE RAIN EARLIER
THAN ANTICIPATED IN SOME OF THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AROUND 1500-2000
FT. HOWEVER...MOST/ALL OF THE ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL TODAY SHOULD BE
CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE AN ADDITIONAL 2-3 INCHES
CANNOT BE RULED OUT IN SOME SPOTS BEFORE 00Z. MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS
WILL EXPERIENCE ALL RAIN...ESPECIALLY ALONG AND SOUTHWEST OF THE
I-26 CORRIDOR WHERE HIGHS WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER IN THE UPPER 30S
TO MID/UPPER 40S IN THE KNOXVILLE METRO AREA. ELSEWHERE... ACROSS
FAR SOUTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU...DRIER AIR
WILL PROMOTE SUNNY CONDITIONS AND WARMER TEMPS IN THE 50S.

ADDITIONALLY...THE STRONG GRADIENT WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORM
SYSTEM WILL CREATE BREEZY CONDITIONS TODAY...AND SOME PRETTY GUSTY
WINDS ALONG THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THUS...GIVEN ALL THE FACTORS
MENTIONED ABOVE WILL OBVIOUSLY MAINTAIN A WINTER STORM WARNING FOR
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE...ALONG WITH THE
WIND ADVISORY FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA AS WELL.

.DISCUSSION...
MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FORECAST...MAINLY TO POPS TO ACCOUNT
FOR THE BROAD AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN GRADUALLY MOVING TO
THE NORTH AND EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND EASTERN ZONES TODAY. IN
GENERAL...THESE SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO WANE FROM WEST TO EAST
THROUGHOUT THE DAY...AND BY 18Z THE HEAVIEST ACTIVITY SHOULD MAINLY
BE CONFINED TO NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.
HOWEVER...A REASONABLE CHANCE FOR SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS WILL
CERTAINLY EXIST ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGHOUT THE
REMAINDER OF THE DAY. WINDS WILL ALSO BECOME BREEZY AT TIMES DURING
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS A STRENGTHENING UPPER-TROUGH CONTINUES
TO SLIDE SOUTHWARD INTO THE REGION FROM THE OHIO VALLEY.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN FAIRLY CONSTANT IN THE UPPER 40S TO
LOWER 50S THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY GIVEN THE DENSE CLOUD
COVER AND SCATTERED PRECIPITATION OCCURRING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...HURRICANE SANDY WILL MOVE NORTH 
OFFSHORE THE MID ATLANTIC COAST THROUGH THE PERIOD. LOW LEVEL 
NORTHERLY FLOW WILL INCREASE UP TO 400 MB THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
SURFACE TO H85 FLOW WILL BECOME NWRLY AND INCREASE THROUGH THE 
PERIOD. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS SHIFT NE THROUGH THE AREA TODAY. 
THIS WILL PROVIDE SOME LIFT FOR REINFORCED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
TODAY. TEMPERATURES WILL HAVE SMALL DIURNAL RANGE AND BE ABOUT 10 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. AS TROUGH AXIS SWINGS NE H85-H70 LAYER 
MOISTURE DROPS OFF. LIGHT RA AND DRIZZLE CONTINUES OVERNIGHT MAINLY 
ACROSS NE AREAS. FREEZING LEVEL DROPS FROM THE WEST TO NEAR SURFACE 
TO AROUND 2500 FEET. SOME WINTRY MIX AND SNOW POSSIBLE ACROSS THE 
HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF SW VA/E TN TONIGHT. LATE NIGHT TEMP DROPS WILL 
BE IN THE LOWER TO MID 30S ACROSS THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. SOME FROST 
AND FREEZE AREAS ARE POSSIBLE. NORTHWEST WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO 
INCREASE WITH THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS MEETING HIGH WIND WARNING 
CRITERIA ON MONDAY AND ADVISORY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF 
MRX CWA. COLD AIR ADVECTION PERSISTS WITH FREEZING LEVEL ONLY 
BUMPING UP TO AROUND 2500 FEET. RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS FAVOR NE AND 
MAINLY UPSLOPE AREAS MONDAY. HIGHER RH VALUES ARE BELOW SNOW GROWTH 
REGION. WIND CHILL READINGS WILL BE IN THE 30S MUCH OF MONDAY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MAJOR WEATHER SYSTEM 
STILL ON TRACK TO EFFECT THE AREA DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE 
EXTENDED.  FIRST CONCERN IS WINDS.  A VERY STRONG WIND FIELD WILL 
DEVELOP OVER THE AREA BY MONDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY.  
WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA WILL LIKELY DEVELOP OVER MUCH OF THE VALLEY 
LOCATIONS WITH HIGH WIND WARNING CRITERIA MET AT HIGH ELEVATIONS... 
WIND GUSTS POSSIBLY REACHING 50 TO 60 MPH AT THE HIGHEST POINTS.  
THEN...MUCH COOLER AIR MOVING IN WILL ALLOW OVERNIGHT LOWS TO FALL 
TO THE FREEZING MARK OR LOWER ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN AND 
THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS AND MID 30S ACROSS THE REST OF THE MRX CWA.  THE 
COLD COMBINED WITH THE WINDS WILL PRODUCE WINDS CHILLS IN THE TEENS 
ACROSS HIGHER TERRAIN.  FINALLY...WITH THE INTRODUCTION OF 
SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF SANDY MOVING IN...EXPECT 
SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS TO CHANGE OVER TO SNOW BY MONDAY NIGHT.  
THERE DOES REMAIN SOME QUESTION ON EXACT TRACK OF THE REMNANTS OF 
SANDY BUT MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THE DEEP MOISTURE WILL REACH INTO 
THE AREA.  THIS COMBINED WITH THE STRONG UPSLOPE FLOW WILL ALLOW FOR 
THE POTENTIAL OF A SIGNIFICANT SNOW EVENT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND 
THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TN.  A WINTER WEATHER WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR 
THE EFFECTED AREAS.  MOISTURE WILL BE MORE LIMITED ACROSS THE LOWER 
ELEVATION OF THE TN VALLEY AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THIS ALONG 
WITH THE WARM GROUND SHOULD ALLOW FOR LITTLE TO NO SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS IN THOSE LOCATIONS.  THE SYSTEM SHOULD PULL AWAY FROM 
THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY ALLOWING FOR IMPROVING CONDITIONS WITH A 
DRYING AND WARMING TREND FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
GENERALLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH HURRICANE SANDY 
LOCATED OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OFF THE GA/SC COAST. A STRONG 
PRESSURE GRADIENT EXISTS OVER THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN SANDY AND A 
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. 
REPORTS FROM THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THIS EVENING INDICATE THAT BREEZY 
WINDS WERE OCCURRING...AND THINK THAT THIS PRESSURE GRADIENT SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO CREATE BREEZY WINDS OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. THUS...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO 
MENTION STRONGER WINDS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATION ZONES. MODELS AGREE 
THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY 
OVERNIGHT...SO WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS SINCE 
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY REMAINS IN CLOSE PROXIMITY. WITH THE UPDATE 
THIS EVENING...WILL PLAN TO ALSO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO 
THE LATEST TRENDS.

333 PM EDT SAT OCT 27 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...THE VERY SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT 
HAS JUST ABOUT WORKED THROUGH OUR AREA...HAVING JUST PASSED 
TRI...AND SHOULD BE JUST TO OUR EAST TONIGHT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
WILL LINGER OVER THE AREA TONIGHT...AND A SHORT WAVE WILL AFFECT THE 
REGION ON SUNDAY.  MAY BE SOME LIGHT SHOWERS AROUND TONIGHT 
ESPECIALLY NORTH...WITH A BETTER CHANCE SUNDAY AGAIN WITH HIGHEST 
PROBABILITIES NORTH.  WILL KEEP SOUTHERN AREAS DRY...WITH POPS AS 
HIGH AS LIKELY FAR NORTHEAST ON SUNDAY. COLDER AIR WILL BE PUSHING 
IN...BUT PRECIP TYPE SHOULD BE MAINLY RAIN FOR THE SHORT TERM.   


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A VERY COMPLICATED
FORECAST IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS A COOL POST- FRONTAL AIRMASS
WILL COMBINE WITH DEEP MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF LANDFALLING
HURRICANE SANDY TO CREATE THE POTENTIAL FOR AN EARLY SEASON WINTER
WEATHER EVENT ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.
THE MAIN QUESTION WILL BE THE EXACT TRACK OF SANDY AS IT MAKES
LANDFALL. WITHIN THE PAST COUPLE OF MODEL RUNS...BOTH THE NAM AND
GFS HAVE SHOWN AN AREA OF DEEP MOISTURE MOVING OVER THE
NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS...ALONG WITH SOME
OROGRAPHIC LIFT AND THE COLD AIR IN PLACE WILL PROVIDE THE
POTENTIAL FOR LIGHT SHOWERS AND EVENTUALLY SNOW SHOWERS...
PARTICULARLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES
SHOULD THIS SCENARIO PLAY OUT. A COUPLE OF LIMITING FACTORS FROM A
CLASSIC NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL EVENT WOULD BE A RELATIVE LACK OF
INSTABILITY AND SOME FAIRLY LOW LAPSE RATES...WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE
POTENTIAL FOR MESOSCALE BANDING/SNOW SQUALLS. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE
PROGGED MOISTURE AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT IN PLACE...SOME LOCALLY HEAVY
SNOWFALL IS CERTAINLY VERY POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS
/PARTICULARLY IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR NORTHEASTERN
TENNESSEE/. MODELS HAVE COME UP WITH SOME FAIRLY HIGH SNOW
AMOUNTS...AND FOR NOW GIVEN SOME OF THE LIMITING FACTORS AND
UNCERTAINTY THINK THAT IT IS SOMEWHAT OVERDONE. SO...GENERALLY SHOW
A STORM SNOWFALL TOTAL THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY OF 0-1 INCHES ACROSS
MOST OF THE VALLEYS...WITH TOTALS APPROACHING 4 INCHES OR HIGHER
ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN PEAKS. IT SHOULD ESPECIALLY BE NOTED THAT THERE
IS STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH THE TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM...AND GIVEN
THE VERY SHARP MOISTURE CUTOFF SHOULD SANDY TRACK FURTHER TO THE
NORTH AND EAST...IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT MOST OF THE AREA WILL
REMAIN DRY. THUS...GIVEN THIS AM CONTINUING TO BE CAUTIOUS FOR NOW
AND WILL CONTINUE TO HANDLE THINGS WITH AN SPS. THE SYSTEM WILL
EVENTUALLY PULL AWAY FROM THE AREA DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE
WEEK...RESULTING IN DRIER CONDITIONS AND A GRADUAL WARMING TREND
HEADING INTO THE FIRST WEEKEND OF NOVEMBER.

INTO THE AREA...AND WILL EXIT TO OUR EAST SATURDAY.  FORCING LOOKS 
WEAK...SO WILL JUST CARRY NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE POPS. BEST CHANCES 
FOR SHOWERS TONIGHT WILL BE WEST...AND SATURDAY HIGHEST CHANCES WILL 
BE NORTH.  COOLER AIR WILL PUSH IN BEHIND THE FRONT...AND SATURDAY 
SHOULD BE MAINLY CLOUDY ESPECIALLY NORTH.  WILL NOT GO FAR FROM MAV 
TEMPS...BUT WILL UNDERCUT MOST MAV HIGHS SLIGHTLY FOR SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE EXTENDED FORECAST 
HINGES ON TROPICAL SYSTEM SANDY WITH AMOUNT OF WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE 
PULLING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY FOR THE NORTHEAST 
SECTIONS AND FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS. MODELS AGREE WITH SOME 
WRAP-AROUND OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION OVER SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST AND FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS. ENOUGH COLD AIR PULLS 
IN THE BACK SIDE OF RAPIDLY INTENSIFYING NORTHEAST SYSTEM TO ALLOW 
PRECIPITATION TO CHANGE TO SNOW OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
(GENERALLY AT OR ABOVE 2500 FEET EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS...AND
GENERALLY AREA-WIDE FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA) LATE SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY 
NIGHT. WILL CALL FOR LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FOR HIGH KNOB (AROUND 
1 INCH TO LOCALLY 2 INCHES TOP OF HIGH KNOB). 

ANOTHER FACTOR FOR MONIGHT NIGHT IS THE POTENTIAL HARD FREEZE ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY ALONG AND NORTH OF INTERSTATE 
40. FREEZE WARNINGS MAY BE ISSUED BY LATTER SHIFTS.

WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE AND WINDY CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY). UPPER LOW SLOWLY LIFT NORTHEAST BY MID-WEEK 
WITH A SLOW WARMING TREND AND MORE SUNSHINE.

SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL WEAKEN TODAY. ANOTHER WARM DAY TODAY 
DOMINATED BY MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS

TN VALLEY.  ONLY CONCERN FOR PRECIP WILL BE A FEW SHOWERS LINGERING 
OVER THE NORTHERN AREAS AND THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS SUNDAY AND

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL
OF FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH SUNNY SKIES NE HALF AND SOME
INCREASED MOISTURE SOUTH WHERE SOME LOW CLOUDINESS HAS FORMED.
HIGHEST TEMPERATURES ARE NE WITH READINGS NEAR 80 AND DEW POINTS
THERE IN THE 40S. COOLER TO THE SW IN THE MID 70S WHERE DEW POINTS
HAVE RISEN TO THE MID 50S TO NEAR 60. EASTERLY FLOW AROUND
HURRICANE SANDY HAS BROUGHT THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE NORTH FROM THE
BAHAMAS INTO FL THE CAROLINAS AND GA. NOT MUCH CHANGE OVERNIGHT
EXCEPT CLOUDS DIMINISH AS HEATING ENDS AND THEN MAY INCREASE SOUTH
LATE WITH EASTERLY FLOW CONTINUEING AS SANDY MOVES NORTH. SE TO
SOUTH FLOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES WARMER TONIGHT ESPECIALLY SOUTH
AND AT MID SLOPES IN MOUNTAINS. COOLEST SPOTS WILL BE COLD AIR
DRAINAGE VALLEYS IN THE NE WHERE DEW POINTS ARE LOWEST. THERE LOWS
SHOULD DROP INTO THE MID 40S.

FRIDAY MOISTURE WILL INCREASE AS COLD FRONT NOW OVER THE GREAT
LAKES TO AR AND EAST TEXAS MOVES EAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY
ABOUT 00Z. MUCH OF THE PRECIPITATION WITH THIS FRONT LIES JUST
ALONG AND BEHIND IT SO OVERALL FRIDAY WILL START OUT MOSTLY SUNNY
TO PARTLY CLOUDY THEN DETERIORATING DURING THE AFTERNOON FROM WEST
TO EAST. KEPT RAIN OUT THROUGH THE DAY. TEMPERATURES WILL ONCE
AGAIN BE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL IN THE 70S TO NEAR 80.
FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE SOUTH AND A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORTH TO MATCH
CLOSER TO TODAYS TRENDS.

.LONG TERM...BIG CHANGES AHEAD WITH THE WEATHER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION AS A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA WILL DRIVE A COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA
LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS
ALONG AND IN WAKE OF THE FRONT ON SATURDAY ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA.
HOWEVER...THE OVERALL TREND WITH THE MODELS HAS BEEN A DRYING ONE
AS MOST OF THE BEST MOISTURE/LIFT WILL BE DISPLACED TO THE NORTH
AND EAST OF THE AREA AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH SHIFTS INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY BY SATURDAY MORNING. AS A RESULT...HAVE KEPT POPS AT SLIGHT
CHANCE TO LOW-END CHANCE ACROSS THE AREA...WITH THE MOST FAVORED
LOCATIONS BEING THE NORTHEAST ZONES.

BY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...SOME CLEARING MAY BEGIN TO TAKE 
PLACE ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES...LEAVING JUST LOW-END 
MENTIONABLE POPS TO THE NORTHEAST. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE 
POTENTIAL FOR CLOUD COVER AND LIGHT SHOWERS...PRIMARILY ALONG THE 
NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AS A LONG WAVE TROUGH DEEPENS 
AND MOVES SOUTH TOWARD THE REGION. THIS TROUGH WILL ALSO CONTAIN 
SOME VERY COLD AIR UNDERNEATH IT...HELPING TO REINFORCE THE COOL 
POST FRONTAL AIRMASS THAT WILL MOVE IN SATURDAY NIGHT...AND HELP TO 
GENERATE THE CLOUDS AND DRIZZLE DURING THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK. 

DESPITE THE PRECIP CHANCES...THIS COOLER AIR WILL BE THE MAIN 
WEATHER STORY THIS WEEKEND INTO THE NEXT WEEK AS THE COLDEST 
TEMPERATURES BY FAR OF THE SEASON WILL BE EXPERIENCED AREAWIDE. 
DAYTIME HIGHS WILL DROP INTO THE 50S ON SUNDAY AND STRUGGLE TO CLIMB 
MUCH ABOVE 45 TO 50 DEGREES ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. IN FACT...SOME 
LOCATIONS ACROSS NE TENNESSEE AND SW VIRGINIA MAY LINGER AROUND 40 
DURING THOSE TWO DAYS. IN ADDITION...OVERNIGHT LOWS LOOK AS THOUGH 
THEY WILL PLUNGE TO BELOW OR JUST ABOVE THE FREEZING MARK OVER A 
GOOD PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA STARTING SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
PERSISTING THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK. A VERY 
GRADUAL WARMING TREND IS EXPECTED TO LATE IN THE PERIOD INTO THE 
FIRST WEEKEND OF NOVEMBER AS THE AFOREMENTIONED SYSTEM PULLS AWAY 
FROM THE AREA. HOWEVER...HIGHS WILL REMAIN IN THE UPPER 40S TO 50S 
IN MOST SPOTS...AND APPROACH OR DROP BELOW FREEZING ACROSS THE FAR 
NORTHEASTERN ZONES THROUGHOUT THE ENTIRE UPCOMING WORK WEEK.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THE PERIOD OF MILD WEATHER WE'VE BEEN HAVING THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS 
WILL COME TO AN ABRUPT END THIS WEEKEND. FRIDAY WILL BE MILD UNDER A 
DEEP SW FLOW...WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND HIGHS IN THE MID 70S TO

AN EMBEDDED SHORTWAVE LIFTING NE ACROSS THE OH VALLEY ON SATURDAY. 
AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MAKE SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESS INTO THE

BEST DYNAMICS WILL PASS TO OUR NORTH. THUS WILL KEEP POPS IN THE LOW 
CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE. 

A LONG NORTHERLY FETCH AND A DEEP LONGWAVE TROUGH SET UP OVER THE 
REGION FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...EVOLVING INTO A CLOSED LOW OVER THE 
OH VALLEY AND MID-ATLANTIC REGION BY TUESDAY. WHILE MOISTURE WILL BE 
LIMITED TO BELOW 800 MB...VERY COLD MIDLEVEL TEMPS BENEATH THE LOW 
COULD PRODUCE BROKEN CLOUDS AND SOME RAIN SHOWERS/SPRINKLES IN

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...EARLY THIS MORNING...A SHORT-
WAVE WAS MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AS
FAR SOUTH AS SOUTHEAST KENTUCKY. THIS ACTIVITY WILL STAY NORTH OF
THE FORECAST AREA...BUT AN AREA OF HIGH/MID LEVEL CLOUDS IS MOVING
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST. THESE CLOUDS WILL MOVE EAST OF
THE AREA BEFORE SUNRISE. SURFACE RIDGING IS PRODUCING CALM WINDS
OVER THE AREA WITH MOST LOCATIONS CLOUD FREE. GOOD RADIATIONAL
COOLING CONDITIONS IS ALLOWING DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS TO FALL TO NEAR
ZERO. AREAS OF FOG...SOME LOCALLY DENSE...WILL DEVELOP THROUGH
SUNRISE...ESPECIALLY NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS.

FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...RIDGING BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL PRODUCE
GENERALLY CLEAR SKIES. PATCHY FOG IS ONCE AGAIN EXPECTED EARLY
THURSDAY MORNING.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED A BLEND OF GFS/MET MOS DUE TO BETTER PERFORMANCE
THE LAST COUPLE DAYS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
WITH A RIDGE ACROSS THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD AND LOW PRESSURE TRACKING 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS...WE WILL SEE AN INCREASING SW FLOW ON 
THURSDAY. THIS WILL BRING TEMPERATURES INTO THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 
80S ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE FRIDAY AHEAD 
OF THE APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH...WITH RAIN CHANCES ARRIVING IN THE 
PLATEAU FRIDAY NIGHT. MODELS ARE IN GENERALLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
TIMING...WITH THE BEST RAIN CHANCES SATURDAY. HOWEVER...THE SYSTEM 
WILL LIKELY BE WEAKENING AS IT APPROACHES SINCE THE UPPER TROUGH 
AXIS IS POSITIVELY TILTED AND THE UPPER JET REMAINS WELL TO OUR 
NORTH. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE SATURDAY...WITH FROPA 
EXPECTED SATURDAY NIGHT. 

SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WILL BE DRY AND COOLER WITH A BROAD LONGWAVE 
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. AN AIR MASS WITH CANADIAN ORIGINS 
WILL BE BUILDING INTO THE AREA. HIGH TEMPS WILL BE IN THE 50S TO 
LOWER 60S SOUTH EACH DAY. MUCH OF THE AREA COULD SEE LOW 
TEMPERATURES NEAR OR BELOW FREEZING BY MONDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING FROM THE SURFACE TO 700 MB WILL BE CENTERED 
OVER THE CAROLINAS TODAY AND TONIGHT. A WEAK TROUGH AT THE 300-500 
MB LEVEL WILL BE CROSSING JUST NORTH OF THE AREA TODAY...BUT THIS 
SHOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ASIDE FROM SOME SCATTERED HIGH CLOUDS. 
WEAK WARM ADVECTION ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE RIDGE WILL BRING HIGH 
TEMPS IN THE MID 70S TO AROUND 80 ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. WE SHOULD 
SEE CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT BEHIND THE UPPER TROUGH...ALLOWING TEMPS TO 
DROP TO THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S IN MOST SPOTS.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THIS PERIOD STARTS WITH 
QUIET WEATHER UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SUBTROPICAL UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGE THAT IS BASED ALONG THE WESTERN GULF AND EXTENDING WWD ACROSS 
BAJA CA.  THE NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM COMES IN FOR THE WEEKEND...AS 
TROPICAL STORM SANDY IS ONLY EXPECTED TO PLAY A PERIPHERAL 
ROLE...WITH THE TIMING OF OUR FRONTAL PASSAGE...AS SANDY STAYS OUT 
OVER THE ATLANTIC.

FIRST CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION MENTIONED IS ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
ON/NEAR THE PLATEAU.  FRONT LOOKS TO SLOW DOWN SOME AS SANDY MOVES 
NORTHWARD...BUT PRECIP AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT WITH OUR 
FRONTAL SYSTEM. ALSO HAVE A MENTION OF THUNDER SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON...THAT COULD BE CLOSE TO FROPA.  ON SUNDAY...MODELS AGREE 
ON POST-FRONTAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEASTERN 
SECTIONS...LOOKS LIKE IT COULD BE A DRIZZLE SCENARIO THROUGH THE 
MORNING...AND EVEN LATER INTO THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE 
APPALACHIANS.  WENT BELOW GUIDANCE ON MAX TEMPS FOR SUNDAY...1-2 
DEGREES FOR SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL AREAS...2-5 DEGREES COOLER ACROSS 
THE NE AND 5-10 DEGREES COOLER THAN GUIDANCE IN THE NERN UPSLOPE 
AREAS.  ALSO TWEAKED HOURLY TEMPERATURE TIMING ON SUNDAY FOR A SLOW 
WARM-UP...AS SATURATED LOW LEVEL CONDITIONS AND COLD ADVECTION 
OFFSET DIURNAL WARMING.

BY MONDAY ALL MODELS AGREE THAT LAST SHORTWAVE WILL BE PAST US...AS 
SANDY MOVES FARTHER AWAY TO THE NORTH OR NORTHEAST...SO MONDAY WENT 
DRY. DRYING OF DEWPOINTS ON MONDAY BY GFS MOS SEEMED WAY 
UNDERDONE...SO MONDAY DEW POINTS IN GRIDS ARE MUCH LOWER THAN 
GUIDANCE.

WARM TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...DRY CONDITIONS WILL 
PERSIST THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK-WEEK WITH SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE ANCHORED IN PLACE. THE UPPER AIR PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO

GRADUALLY WARM AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE THROUGH 
THE WEEK. MODELS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT IN REGARDS TO TIMING OF 
THE FRONTAL PASSAGE THROUGH OUR AREA SATURDAY AFTERNOON. AT THIS 
TIME THE AIRMASS LOOKS STABLE HOWEVER THERE COULD STILL BE AN 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM IN THE SHOWERS THAT WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE FRONT. THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT WHEN IT COMES TO LINGERING 
PRECIP CHANCES INTO SUNDAY. THE ECMWF IS MUCH COLDER POSSIBLY DUE TO 
THE WAY IT HANDLES - THE YET TO FORM - TROPICAL STORM/HURRICANE AND 
TRACKING IT INTO THE NEW ENGLAND STATES. WHILE THE GFS KEEPS THE 
STORM WELL OUT IN THE ATLANTIC. THE AIRMASS AND RAINFALL TIMING WILL 
BE SOMETHING TO WATCH IN THE COMING DAYS.

LOW CLOUDS FROM AN UPPER-LEVEL IMPULSE OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY HAVE WORKED THEIR WAY INTO WESTERN AND PORTIONS OF MIDDLE
TN. HOWEVER...THEY SHOULD REMAIN WEST OF OUR AREA...WITH JUST SOME
SCT PASSING HIGH CLOUDS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT. THE COMBINATION OF CALM
WINDS AND CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING
ONCE AGAIN...WITH LOWS BOTTOMING OUT IN THE 40S IN MOST VALLEY

.DISCUSSION...
THE MAIN ADJUSTMENT TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING WAS TO THE SKY
GRIDS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LINGERING BROKEN TO OVERCAST DECKS OF LOW
CLOUDS ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES AND ALONG THE MOUNTAINS. OVER THE
COURSE OF THE EVENING AND NIGHT...THIS CLOUD COVER IS PROGGED TO
GRADUALLY BREAK UP SOMEWHAT...RESULTING IN AT LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY
CONDITIONS FOR A MAJORITY OF THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE TONIGHT.
THIS TREND IS GENERALLY SUPPORTED BY THE LATEST IR SATELLITE
IMAGERY...THOUGH SOME PATCHES OF DENSER CLOUD COVER COULD LINGER
AND PASS OVER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN ZONES/MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT.
THIS LEADS TO A BIT OF A TRICKY FORECAST REGARDING PATCHY FOG
FORMATION AND FROST DEVELOPMENT. WITH CALM WINDS IN PLACE...GOOD
RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL OCCUR IN AREAS THAT REMAIN CLEAR/MOSTLY
CLEAR. LOW TEMPERATURES ARE GENERALLY EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE
LOWER 40S TO POTENTIALLY THE MID/UPPER 30S IN SHELTERED VALLEYS
ALONG THE MOUNTAINS. THIS WILL CREATE A FROST POTENTIAL IN THESE
COLD POCKETS ALONG THE MOUNTAIN ZONES...WHERE A FROST ADVISORY IS
IN EFFECT FROM 4-9 AM EDT. ADDITIONALLY THE POTENTIAL FOR PATCHY
FOG WILL EXIST ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING.
HOWEVER...THE PRESENCE OF CLOUD COVER IN CERTAIN LOCALIZED AREAS
COULD KEEP TEMPERATURES UP A FEW MORE DEGREES AND LIMIT FOG/FROST
DEVELOPMENT THERE. THE GIVEN THE LATEST TRENDS/PROGS WITH SOME
CLEARING TAKING PLACE...STILL FEEL A MENTION OF FOG/FROST IS
WARRANTED AND MADE NO CHANGES TO THE WX GRIDS.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED 
NEAR DETROIT...WITH AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE 
NORTHERN GULF COASTAL REGION. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME CLOUDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY MOVE NORTHEAST 
TODAY AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DRIFTS NORTHEAST...BUT MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES WILL LIKELY LINGER THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...AND WILL NOT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
CLOSED LOW OVER MI WILL CONTINUE ITS SLOW TREK NORTHEAST TODAY. 
EXPECT THAT THE OVERCAST TO BROKEN CLOUD COVER THIS MORNING WILL 
GRADUALLY BECOME SCATTERED FROM SW TO NE AS THE LOW PULLS FARTHER 
AWAY AND 500 MB HEIGHTS RISE. THE MODELS APPEAR TO BE UNDERDONE WITH 
THE AMOUNT OF UPSTREAM CLOUD COVER. AS A RESULT...WILL LEAN TOWARD 
THE COOLER SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS TODAY. CLEARING SHOULD 
COME TONIGHT AS A RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST. WITH THE SURFACE 
HIGH BECOMING CENTERED OVER THE AREA TONIGHT...CONDITIONS LOOK 
FAVORABLE FOR FOG LATE TONIGHT...AND WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE LINGERS ACROSS
THE REGION RESULTING IN DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. A
FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA ON FRIDAY. THERE IS STILL SOME
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS ON THE PATHS AND MOISTURE EXPECTED.

.DISCUSSION...
IT WAS AN INTERESTING AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS A DUST
PLUME FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS REGION WAS LOFTED BY THE PREVAILING
WINDS AROUND AN UPPER-STORM SYSTEM AND PUSHED OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. VISIBILITIES HAVE IMPROVED AS WINDS HAVE BEGUN TO
RELAX AFTER SUNSET...BUT A MINOR HAZE IS STILL BEING REPORTED AT
KTYS FROM SOME REMNANT DUST PARTICULATES STILL IN THE AIR. OVC/BKN
DECKS OF LOW TO MID CLOUD WILL PASS OVERHEAD ON THE BACK SIDE OF
THIS STORM SYSTEM THROUGH THE EVENING AND MOST OF THE OVERNIGHT
PERIOD IN THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES. HOWEVER...SATELLITE TRENDS AND
MODEL PROGS INDICATE THAT THIS CLOUD COVER SHOULD BEGIN TO BREAK UP
AFTER 06Z OR SO IN MANY AREAS. STILL...TEMPERATURES COULD BE A
DEGREE OR TWO WARMER IN THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES WHERE BKN/OVC DECKS
MAY HANG ON FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT...LIMITING RADIATIONAL COOLING
SOME. OTHERWISE...LOWS IN THE LOWER 40S ARE GENERALLY EXPECTED IN
THE VALLEYS AREAWIDE TONIGHT. THE ONLY OTHER CHANGE TO THE FORECAST
THAT WAS MADE WAS TO ADJUST CLOUD COVER TO MOSTLY CLOUDY TO
OVERCAST BEFORE 06Z TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CURRENT SKY CONDITIONS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER LAKE 
MICHIGAN...WHICH WAS CREATING BREEZY SOUTHWEST WINDS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH AREAS OF DUST BLOWING UP THE GREAT TN VALLEY. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY AND WIND TRAJECTORIES INDICATE THAT THIS DUST 
PLUME EXTENDS BACK TO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS (OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS)...AND 
THINK THAT THIS BLOWING DUST WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AFTER SUNSET WHEN 
THE WINDS DIMINISH. THE LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION IS PROGGED TO ONLY SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT...AND WILL LIKELY BRING AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS OVER 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION 
SOME SPRINKLES OVER SOUTHWEST VA FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...SINCE 
THE MODELS AGREE THAT SOME LIGHT QPF WILL BE GENERATED WITH THE 
PASSAGE OF A FEW UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVES ROTATING AROUND THE LARGE 
UPPER-LEVEL CUT-OFF LOW. HIGH PRESSURE AND AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL 
THEN BUILD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT... 
BRINGING TRANQUIL CONDITIONS AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. AS FOR TEMPS... 
NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE ON SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT WHEN SOME 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STRONG SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IN 
CONTROL FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED. AS A RESULT...WILL SEE DRY AND 
WARM CONDITIONS. HOWEVER...MODELS IS POOR AGREEMENT BY THE END OF

A CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL SLOWLY TRAVERSE THE GREAT LAKES TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. ON THE SOUTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE LOW...WE CAN EXPECT 
MIDLEVEL CLOUDS TO INCREASE THROUGH THE DAY AS 500 MB TEMPS DROP AND 
DIFFERENTIAL PVA CROSSES THE AREA. HOWEVER NO MEASURABLE PRECIP IS 
EXPECTED AS MOISTURE IS LIMITED TO A THIN LAYER...AND LOW LEVELS 
WILL BE DRYING WITH FALLING DEWPOINTS THIS AFTERNOON. MAX MOISTURE 
DEPTH BETWEEN 850-700 MB OCCURS IN NORTHERN AREAS BETWEEN 06Z-09Z. 
THIS MAY PRODUCE SOME DRIZZLE AT BEST. NAM AND GFS MOS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT TODAY AND TONIGHT...SO WILL STAY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPS. HIGHS TODAY WILL BE MAINLY IN THE 60S...WITH LOWS TONIGHT IN 
THE 40S. SOME GUSTY WINDS CAN BE EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON...IN THE

1000 AM EDT THU OCT 18 2012

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED COLD FRONT 
GENERALLY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...WITH SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS 
REDEVELOPING ALONG IT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A DEEP 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL FURTHER AMPLIFY OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY 
TODAY...WHICH SHOULD PUSH THIS COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
BY MID AFTERNOON. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT SOME MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY MAY DEVELOP OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA LATER 
THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON BEFORE THE FRONT EXITS THE REGION. 
THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION SOME TSTORMS...BUT WILL LOWER POPS 
FOR THE REST OF TODAY AND ONLY MENTION SCATTERED COVERAGE. 

WILL ALSO PLAN TO LET THE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE FOOTHILLS EXPIRE... 
SINCE WINDS HAVE DECREASED WITH THE WIND SHIFT TO THE SOUTHWEST 
DIRECTION. EARLIER THIS MORNING (AFTER MIDNIGHT)...CAMP CREEK WIND 
TOWER (SOUTHEAST GREENE COUNTY) OBSERVED WIND GUSTS UP TO 56 MPH... 
WITH COVE MOUNTAIN WIND TOWER (GREAT SMOKY MTN NATIONAL PARK) 
OBSERVING WIND GUSTS UP TO 78 MPH.

351 AM EDT THU OCT 18 2012

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
A WEAKENING LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO TRACK INTO THE
FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE NEARLY COMPLETE
LACK OF INSTABILITY IN PLACE ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE ATTM...THE
OVERALL THUNDER THREAT WILL FURTHER DIMINISH OVER THE COURSE OF THE
EARLY MORNING HOURS. HOWEVER...GIVEN A LOW-LEVEL JET IN PLACE AND
SOME MODEST INSTABILITY ALOFT...SOME ISOLATED STORMS WILL STILL BE
POSSIBLE. THE AFOREMENTIONED JET AND ASSOCIATED BULK SHEAR VALUES
OF 50-60 KTS WILL CREATE SOME GUSTY WINDS WITH THESE STORMS ALONG
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND PARTICULARLY
ALONG THE SPINE OF THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS WHERE GUSTS UP TO 40 MPH
WILL BE POSSIBLE IN SOME LOCALIZED SPOTS. THUS...A WIND ADVISORY IS
IN PLACE ACROSS THE FOOTHILLS THROUGH LATE MORNING.

THE ADVANCING AREA OF SHOWER/STORMS WILL HAVE MOVED THROUGH THE
WESTERN ZONES BY THE EARLY MORNING...AND SHOULD CLEAR MOST OF THE
AREA BY LATE MORNING/MIDDAY. HOWEVER...SOME ENHANCED INSTABILITY
VALUES ALOFT JUST AHEAD OF THE ADVANCING COLD FRONT MAY CREATE THE
POTENTIAL FOR AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF ISOLATED/SCATTERED STORMS
ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES DURING THE
AFTERNOON. OTHERWISE...CLEARING CONDITIONS AND A COOLER AND DRIER
AIR MASS WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONTAL
PASSAGE. THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME COOLER HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE
UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S...AND LOWS TONIGHT IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER
40S. 

.LONG TERM.../FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
CLOSED UPPER LOW KEEPS A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA FRIDAY...PLUS A STRONG SHORTWAVE DROPS ACROSS KY AND
NRN PARTS OF TN/SW VA TO ENHANCE THE GUSTINESS OF THE SW WINDS.
18/00Z NAM 12KM WINDS LOOKED VERY GOOD AND COULD BE BORDERLINE ON
WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA. KEEPING A FEW CLOUDS OVER NRN AREAS AND A
DRY FORECAST.

THE UPPER LOW LIFTS NE BY LATE SATURDAY AND A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION SUNDAY AND MONDAY. THE SURFACE RIDGE 
SETTLES ACROSS THE SRN APPALACHIANS AND DOES NOT MOVE MUCH THROUGH 
MID NEXT WEEK...WHILE THE UPPER RIDGE FLATTENS SLIGHTLY. THE 00Z 
MODEL RUNS ARE VERY CONSISTENT WITH 12Z RUNS IN A DRY FORECAST...
WITH ONLY VERY MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO FORECAST GRIDS ATTM.

245 PM EDT WED OCT 17 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD...WITH A COLD FRONT EXTENDING OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY AND 
OZARKS REGION. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY BEHIND THIS FRONT TONIGHT...WHICH WILL HELP TO 
GENERATE AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CONVECTION OVER THE LOWER AND MID MS 
RIVER VALLEYS THIS EVENING. THIS AREA OF CONVECTION WILL MOVE 
EASTWARD OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...AND SHOULD BEGIN TO 
AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE 
SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY ABOVE A STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER FROM THE 
SURFACE UP TO 850 MB. THUS...EXPECT THIS CONVECTION TO WEAKEN AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...BUT WILL MENTION SOME TSTORMS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA DUE TO THE ELEVATED INSTABILITY. MODELS INDICATE A VERY STRONG 
850 MB WIND FLOW IN EXCESS OF 60 KT DEVELOPING OVER CENTRAL KY LATE 
TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH A STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER AND A VEERING 
WIND PROFILE OVER THE MOUNTAINS...AND A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW NEARLY 
PERPENDICULAR TO THE MOUNTAINS...THINK THAT MOUNTAIN WAVES WILL BE 
POSSIBLE ALONG THE FOOTHILLS AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. THIS SCENARIO 
TONIGHT IS NOT NECESSARILY THE MOST OPTIMUM SET-UP FOR MOUNTAIN 
WAVES...BUT IT APPEARS THAT ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS (AROUND 25 TO 35 
MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS) WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE FAVORED AREAS OF THE 
FOOTHILLS. THESE LOW-LEVEL WINDS WILL THEN BECOME MORE SOUTHWESTERLY 
AFTER SUNRISE THURSDAY MORNING...WHICH SHOULD DIMINISH THE THREAT OF 
MOUNTAIN WAVES. HOWEVER...STRONG GUSTY WINDS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE 
AFTER SUNRISE...SINCE THE MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE SOME INSTABILITY 
DEVELOPING IN THE LOW LEVELS BELOW 850 MB. THIS SURFACE-BASED 
INSTABILITY MAY ALLOW SOME OF THE STRONGER 850 MB WINDS TO DESCEND 
TO THE SURFACE WITH ANY CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ALONG THE COLD FRONT. IT 
APPEARS THAT THE OVERALL INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE 
A LITTLE BETTER ALONG THE COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY MORNING...SO WILL 
CONTINUE TO MENTION TSTORMS THURSDAY MORNING...AND WILL UPDATE THE 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME TSTORMS 
WITH DAMAGING WINDS OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA BEFORE THIS 
COLD FRONT EXITS THE FORECAST AREA IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON. 
THEREAFTER...A CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW WILL LINGER AROUND THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...WHICH MAY BRING SOME CLOUDS TO 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT DRY 
WEATHER IS EXPECTED FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM 
AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE UPPER TROUGH 
RESPONSIBLE FOR THE FRONTAL PASSAGE THURSDAY MORNING WILL BE 
SHIFTING FARTHER EAST BY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. THUS DAYTIME HIGHS ON 
SATURDAY AND MORNING SUNDAY LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER THAN 
SEASONAL TEMPERATURES. A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WILL PERSIST THROUGH 
MID WEEK IN RESPONSE TO SHORTWAVE RIDGING AND ASSOCIATED LOW LEVEL 
SOUTHERLY FLOW.

RAIN CHANCES SATURDAY WILL BE LOW PARTICULARLY OVER NE TN AND SW VA 
TO NON-EXISTENT. DRY CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED THROUGH AT LEAST 
TUESDAY. THE LONGER RANGE MODELS THAT REFLECT TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY 
TIME-FRAME ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH REGARDS TO SURFACE FRONTAL 
FEATURES. CONFIDENCE IS LOW REGARDING RAIN CHANCES FOR TUESDAY BUT 
HAVE CONTINUED WITH NO MENTION OF POPS.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL PROMOTE DRY WEATHER AND MOSTLY
SUNNY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. THIS...COMBINED
WITH A PREVAILING SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL HELP TO PROMOTE MILD
TEMPERATURES AS HIGHS TOP OFF IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S IN MOST
VALLEY LOCATIONS. HOWEVER...A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN WILL OCCUR
LATER TONIGHT AS THE RIDGE SCOOTS EAST AND A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED
WITH A DEEP UPPER-LOW ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES MOVES THROUGH THE
REGION. A LOW-LEVEL JET RAMPING UP AHEAD OF THIS FRONT WILL
INCREASE MOISTURE AND CREATE GOOD CHANCES FOR SHOWERS /OVERSPREADING
THE AREA FROM WEST TO EAST/ AFTER MIDNIGHT. THOUGH INSTABILITY
PARAMETERS APPEAR TO BE VERY LOW...SOME MODEST MLCAPE VALUES COULD
ALLOW FOR SOME ISOLATED WEAK STORMS TO PERSIST OVERNIGHT FROM
DECAYING CONVECTION ACROSS WESTERN/MIDDLE TENNESSEE EARLIER IN THE
EVENING. THE BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION WILL BE ACROSS THE
PLATEAU LATE TONIGHT...BEFORE TRANSITIONING TO THE EASTERN ZONES
AFTER SUNRISE WITH THE ADVANCING COLD FRONT. BY THE MID/LATE
AFTERNOON...RAINFALL WILL HAVE WANED AS THE FRONT MOVES
EAST...LEAVING A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
IN ITS WAKE.

.LONG TERM.../THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...SOME LINGERING
WEATHER CONCERNS TO START OUT AS THE WRN GREAT LAKES UPPER LOW DOES
NOT LIFT NE UNTIL EARLY SATURDAY. THIS MAY KEEP SOME CLOUDS ACROSS
NRN AREAS AND CERTAINLY SOME BREEZY TO WINDY CONDITIONS.
HOWEVER...ALL MODELS GENERALLY SUPPORT A DRY FORECAST FOR OUR
REGION RIGHT ON THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. GRIDS
WERE FRESHENED WITH THE STRONGER NAM 12KM WINDS INTO SATURDAY
MORNING...THEN THE GRADIENT RELAXES AS THE SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE
BUILD EASTWARD.

A WEAK DISTURBANCE MAY TRACK NE FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO 
OHIO VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY...BUT THIS PROBABLY WILL HAVE 
LITTLE EFFECT ON OUR WEATHER. THUS...KEEPING POPS IN THE 8 TO 14 
PERCENT RANGE FOR ALL PERIODS...AS GFSX MOS POPS WERE VERY LOW AND 
CONSISTENT FROM THE 16/12Z TO 17/00Z RUNS. GFSX MOS MINS AND MAXES

AMOUNT OF INCONSISTENCY DEVELOPING BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.  
FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE PERIOD IS ABOVE AVERAGE EARLY...DROPPING 
TO ABOUT AVERAGE LATE. A COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT/EARLY THURSDAY. FAIRLY STRONG LOW LEVEL JET AHEAD OF 
THIS FRONT WILL BRING BRIEF SHOT OF SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE...ALTHOUGH 
FORCING DOES NOT LOOK IMPRESSIVE FOR OUR AREA.  EXPECT SOME 
WEAKENING CONVECTION TO PUSH INTO THE AREA AND CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AS 
IS MOVES THROUGH.  WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS WEST AND CHANCE POPS EAST 
WED NIGHT...THEN CHANCE POPS EAST SLIGHT CHANCE WEST ON THU.  WILL 
ADD MENTION OF A CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER AS WELL.  WINDS 
WILL LIKELY BE QUITE GUSTY FOR SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND 
FOOTHILLS LATE WED NIGHT...BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP BELOW WIND ADVISORY 
LEVELS. WITH UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY CANNOT RULE 
OUT SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING AROUND AND BRINGING A FEW 
SHOWERS MAINLY NORTH...BUT AT THIS POINT STILL LOOKS LIKE ANY PRECIP 
SHOULD STAY NORTH OF OUR AREA SO WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY BOTH DAYS.  
RIDGE WILL BUILD IN LATER IN THE PERIOD...SO WILL GO PRECIP FREE 
REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
TEMPS RUNNING A BIT ABOVE HOURLY GRIDS THIS MORNING...ALTHO SKIES
ARE MOSTLY CLEAR WITH VERY LIGHT WINDS. PATCHY FROST MAY STILL
DEVELOP BUT CERTAINLY NOT ON A VERY BROAD SCALE. LOOKS LIKE
ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND 850 MB TEMPS AT OR A LITTLE ABOVE
YESTERDAY...SO I WAS IN FAVOR OF GOING WITH OR JUST A DEGREE OR TWO
ABOVE THE MILDER GFS MOS MAXES.

THE SURFACE RIDGE SHIFTS SLIGHTLY EASTWARD TONIGHT AND 850 MB RH 
INCREASES BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...NOT MUCH IN THE 
WAY OF CLOUDS INDICATED...ALTHO MILDER 850 MB TEMPS DO SUPPORT A 
BLEND OF THE SIMILAR MOS MIN TEMPS. ANY FROST SHOULD BE LIMITED TO 
JUST THE NRN VALLEY OF NE TN...CENTERED AROUND TRI. 


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/... 
A SURFACE RIDGE WILL PROMOTE FAIRLY MILD CONDITIONS ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY...BEFORE IT SCOOTS OFF TO THE EAST. THIS
WILL ALLOW FOR A WEAK COLD FRONT TO PUSH INTO THE REGION FROM THE
WEST WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...AS A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW
ROTATES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. THE DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM ARE
FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE...WITH BULK SHEAR VALUES AOA 60 KTS BY 12Z
THURSDAY. HOWEVER...THE TIMING OF THE ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION
/WHICH WILL BE LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING/ WILL
RESULT IN LOW INSTABILITY VALUES...AND THUS A VERY LIMITED THUNDER
POTENTIAL. AS SUCH...HAVE JUST GONE WITH A MENTION OF SHOWERS
DURING THIS PERIOD...THOUGH SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY COULD RESULT
IN SOME LOCALIZED RUMBLES OF THUNDER. A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS
WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA IN WAKE OF THE FRONT...RESULTING COOLER
TEMPERATURES /WITH HIGHS GENERALLY REMAINING IN THE 60S AREAWIDE
THROUGH THE WEEKEND/. A GRADUAL WARMING TREND IS EXPECTED HEADING
INTO THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE TO THE SOUTH NUDGES INTO THE REGION.

INDICATED BEHIND THIS SYSTEM SO WILL GO PRECIP FREE FOR FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY. IN THE FAST FLOW CANNOT RULE OUT ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM

OF A CROSSVILLE TN TO BOWLING GREEN KY LINE AT 08Z THIS MORNING. 
PRETTY SOLID AREA OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO ZFP PRODUCT FEATURES A PRE-FIRST PERIOD TO 
COVER THIS LINGERING CONVECTION. LOW LEVEL JET HAS DECREASED TO 30 
KNOTS OR LESS...AND PRESSURE RISES BEHIND THE FRONT ARE NOT VERY 
SIGNIFICANT. THUS...NO WIND CONCERNS AT THIS TIME.

TRIMMED POPS BACK A BIT QUICKER FROM MID MORNING INTO THIS AFTERNOON
WITH CLOUDS DECREASING TO ALLOW MAX TEMPS AROUND THE SIMILAR MOS 
VALUES. CLEARING TREND TONIGHT AND IF WINDS DROP OFF ENOUGH...I 
EXPECT AT LEAST PATCHY FROST AND ANY AREAS THAT DROP INTO THE MID TO 
UPPER 30S. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING A
MOSTLY SUNNY SKY TO THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES
SLIGHTLY COOLER BEHIND TODAYS COLD FRONT. THE SURFACE HIGH SHIFTS
QUICKLY EAST TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. COULD BE SOME PATCHY
FROST IN MOUNTAIN VALLEYS TUESDAY NIGHT BUT SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL
LIKELY KEEP TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN TUESDAY MORNINGS
READINGS. SOUTHERLY FLOW THEN WARMS TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES
WEDNESDAY. NEXT COLD FRONT MOVES INTO TN VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS
TROUGH MOVES INTO THE PLAINS AND CLOSES OFF. MOISTURE INCREASES
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH SHOWERS POSSIBLE BY THURSDAY MORNING.
INSTABILITY DOES NOT LOOK THAT IMPRESSIVE AHEAD OF THIS FRONT SO
FORECASTING ONLY SHOWERS NOW. FAIRLY DEEP SURFACE AND UPPER LOW
MOVES INTO GREAT LAKES AND BRINGS MORE SHORT WAVE ENERGY FROM THE
NW WHICH WILL KEEP SHOWERS AROUND THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AND
FRIDAY. UPPER LOW SHIFTS NE SATURDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING
BACK OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES.

TEMPS OFF TO A SLOW START DUE TO MORNING FOG. HOWEVER 10 MORE 
DEGREES IS ATTAINABLE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRY AIR IS MORE NOTABLE THIS 
MORNING OVER THE NRN 1/2 TO 2/3RDS OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH SOME 
PATCHY AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC. 
ALSO...LIKELY SOME PATCHY VALLEY FOG NEAR LAKES/STREAMS OVER NRN 
AREAS WHERE CLEARING OCCURRED. EXPECT ANY LINGERING CLOUDS/FOG TO 
GIVE WAY TO AT LEAST PARTLY SUNNY SKIES AND WARMER TEMPS TODAY. MOS 
MAXES WERE QUITE CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED. 

WON'T HAVE ANY PESKY LOW CLOUDS OR FOG TONIGHT AS CLOUDS AND WINDS 
INCREASE AHEAD OF THE DEVELOPING COLD FRONT. LOW LEVEL JET IS TO OUR 
WEST THROUGH 18Z SUNDAY...SO NAM 12KM WINDS WERE TAPERED DOWN A BIT 
IN THE GRIDS. STILL WITH CLOUDS AND WINDS TONIGHT...I THINK MINS MAY 
BE QUITE MILD...SO I WENT WITH THE WARMER NAM MOS MINS EXCEPT IN THE 
FAR NE AREAS SUCH AS TRI. 

FOR GENERAL INFORMATION...USGS REPORTED A 2.5 MAG EARTHQUAKE 
CENTERED 1 MILE SOUTH OF MCCAYSVILLE GA (JUST SOUTH OF DUCKTOWN TN) 
AT 1203 AM EDT. FELT BY A FEW FOLKS ACROSS POLK TN AND CHEROKEE/CLAY 
COUNTIES OF NC WITH NO DAMAGE AT ALL.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...NEXT SYSTEM BRINGS A STRONG 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA EARLY MONDAY. BEFORE THAT 
DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SUNDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON MOVING NE INTO 
THE GREAT LAKES WITH STRENGTHENING SOUTHWEST FLOW BRINGING MOISTURE 
AND WARMING IN THE LOW LEVELS. MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION AREA MOVES 
NE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES BUT LINE OF SHOWERS AND 
STORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS WEST TN AHEAD OF THE FRONT SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
AND MOVE EAST INTO MIDDLE TN BY LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. BEST 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. 
THIS LINE SHOULD WEAKEN BEFORE IT GETS TO THE PLATEAU BUT SOME 
STRONG STORMS ARE POSSIBLE THERE. LATER SUNDAY EVENING FARTHER EAST 
EXPECT MOSTLY SHOWERS. SECONDARY AREA OR LINE OF SHOWERS ASSOCIATED 
WITH ACTUAL FRONT MOVES IN MONDAY MORNING ADDITIONAL THUNDERSTORMS 
POSSIBLE ALONG FRONT. IMPROVING CONDITIONS MONDAY AFTERNOON BEHIND 
FRONT FROM WEST TO EAST. SOME MORE SHOWERS POSSIBLE IN THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS WITH UPPER TROUGH BEFORE 00Z TUESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE 
SETTLES IN MONDAY NIGHT AND WILL BRING A QUIET PATTERN THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. CLOUDS INCREASE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES. THIS SYSTEM IS SIMILAR TO THE FIRST ONE WITH SHOWERS 
DEVELOPING WITH PRE FRONTAL BAND THURSDAY. PREFER SLOWER ECMWF 
SOLUTION WITH MORE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE STORMS THURSDAY NIGHT WITH 
FRONT. DEEP TROUGH MOVING IN BEHIND FRONT WITH WRAP AROUND SHOWERS 
FRIDAY. FOLLOWED WARMER NAM GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES SUNDAY AND A 
BLEND SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR REST OF

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
CONTINUE TO TRACK SE FROM NRN MIDDLE TN THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...THE 
AIRMASS OVER E TN IS QUITE STABLE...SO THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD WEAKEN.
I KEPT POPS AROUND 30 PERCENT IN THE WEST AND 20 PERCENT PERCENT 
ELSEWHERE...MAINLY THIS MORNING AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS. ADDED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR SE TN COUNTIES...ALONG THE EDGE OF SOME 
SLIGHT INSTABILITY THIS MORNING.

OTHERWISE...LITTLE CHANGES MADE FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. KEPT 
MAX TEMPS JUST A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW THE GFS MOS MAXES. GFS MOS MINS 
REASONABLE WITH SKIES BECOMING MOSTLY CLEAR BEHIND FRONTAL PASSAGE.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE AT THE
SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL ALLOW FOR A MOSTLY SUNNY SATURDAY. THE SURFACE
HIGH SHIFTS QUICKLY EAST SATURDAY NIGHT WITH A DEEPENING AREA OF
LOW PRESSURE OVER THE PLAINS WITH A STRONG LOW LEVEL JET CAUSING
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OUT AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM AND
MOVE INTO THE TN VALLEY BY SUNDAY MORNING. THE AIR MASS BECOMES
MODERATELY UNSTABLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY WITH A POSSIBLE
SQUALL LINE DEVELOPING DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH
DAMAGING WINDS A THREAT. SHOWERS CONTINUE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND
MONDAY AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. BEHIND THIS FRONT MONDAY NIGHT
THROUGH WEDNESDAY HIGH PRESSURE WITH MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY
SKIES WILL PREVAIL. ANOTHER FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACHES WEDNESDAY
NIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS. THIS SYSTEM DOES
NOT LOOK AS STRONG AS THE SUNDAY SYSTEM AND INSTABILITY NOT AS HIGH
SO ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THUNDER.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...FIRST CONCERN IS WHEN THE
CLOUDS WILL BREAK. TN VALLEY STILL MOSTLY OVERCAST. SPLIT THE DIFF
BETWEEN THE COOLER MAV AND WARMER MET MOS ON MINS TONIGHT AND MAX
TEMPS WEDNESDAY. BUT WITH W TO NW WINDS EXPECTED TO PICK UP LATE
MORNING...AHEAD OF APPROACHING FRONT...WILL EXPECT THE LOW STUFF TO
BE GONE BY THEN. CUT BACK ON POPS AND PRECIP AREA WITH FROPA
WEDNESDAY AS MODELS ARE BASICALLY DRY...EXCEPT FOR ECMWF WITH A
HUNDREDTH. KEPT SLGT CHANCES FOR THE PLATEAU EARLY...THEN THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS N AND NE IN THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN FOR THE REST OF THE 
WEEK...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A ZONAL UPPER-LEVEL FLOW LINGERING OVER 
THE NATION WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
ON FRIDAY. MODELS INDICATE ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE WITH THIS WEAK COLD 
FRONT...SO WILL MENTION ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY. A MORE 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP FOR THE 
WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT 
APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED 
TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY AROUND THE FORECAST AREA BY EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...AND SHOULD BECOME THE FOCUS FOR SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION EACH 
DAY EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS THEN BEGIN TO DIVERGE WITH 
THEIR SOLUTIONS BY THE END OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT GENERALLY 
INDICATE AN UNSETTLED PERIOD WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN BRINGING A STRONGER COLD FRONT INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...CLEARNIG AND COLDER TONIGHT
WITH PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING A FEW HOURS AFTER SKIES CLEAR...THEN
SOME PATCHY FROST AS WELL BEFORE DAWN NORTH AND HIGHER TERRAIN.
ONCE FOG BURNS OFF...TUESDAY WILL BE A BEAUTIFUL DAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE WEEKEND...AND 
GENERALLY REVEAL SEVERAL WEAK COLD FRONTS THROUGHOUT THE WEEK WITH A 
MORE AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. BOTH THE GFS 
AND ECMWF MODELS INDICATE ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE WITH THE WEAK COLD 
FRONTS THIS WEEK...WITH ONE EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY...FRIDAY...AND 
SUNDAY. AS A RESULT...WILL MENTION ONLY LOW POPS DURING THESE 
PERIODS OF FRONTAL PASSAGES. WITH NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT LINGERING 
THROUGHOUT THE WEEK...TEMPS SHOULD REMAIN NEAR NORMAL WITH ONLY A 
SLIGHT COOL DOWN EXPECTED BEHIND THE WEAK COLD FRONTS. IN FACT...AN 
UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR 
THE WEEKEND...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO WARM TEMPS ABOVE NORMAL. THE GFS 
AND ECMWF MODELS THEN BEGIN TO DIVERGE WITH THEIR SURFACE PATTERNS 
BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...BUT GENERALLY AGREE THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL 
PATTERN WILL BECOME MORE AMPLIFIED OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY ON 
MONDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE GFS NUMBERS 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE

TONIGHT...AND EXPECT SOME PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP.  MAY ALSO BE COLD 
ENOUGH MAINLY NORTH FOR SOME PATCHY FROST TO DEVELOP...SO WILL CARRY 
MENTION OF THIS IN FORECAST AS WELL.  AT THIS POINT CONFIDENCE NOT 
HIGH THAT IT WILL BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH FOR A FROST ADVISORY...SO 
WILL LET DAY SHIFT TAKE ANOTHER LOOK.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO JUST A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.    

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS AFFECT THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK. MODELS STILL SHOW THE 
FIRST SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL HAVE ONLY LIMITED 
IMPACT ON THE REGION WITH DEEP MOISTURE LACKING AND BETTER LIFT WELL 
NORTH OF THE AREA. THEREFORE MAINTAINED A DRY FROPA FOR POINTS 
BASICALLY SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40 WHILE KEEPING SOME SLIGHT AND LOW 
CHANCE POPS FURTHER NORTH. DRY ADVECTION BEGINS BEHIND THIS SYSTEM 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING ACROSS MUCH OF THE EASTERN U.S. MODELS APPEAR TO BE 
MAINTAINING CONSISTENCY WITH THE NEXT SHORT WAVE AND SURFACE COLD 
FRONT IMPACTING THE REGION LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...WITH 
LIMITED MOISTURE AND UNIMPRESSIVE LIFT. STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR A SHOWER NORTH HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR THIS SYSTEM. ECMWF 
AND GFS SIMILAR IN DEPICTION A NICE AMPLIFICATION TO THE UPPER 
PATTERN WHICH FEATURES RIDGING ON SATURDAY WITH WARM AND MOIST 
SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPING LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AHEAD OF 
THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM. WENT WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION 
DURING THE DAY SUNDAY BECAUSE OF SLOWER ARRIVAL OF SYSTEM COLD FRONT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
A SHORT PERIOD OF CLEARING WILL OCCUR THIS EVENING AS THE TROUGH 
NEAR THE APPALACHIANS PUSHES EAST AND DRIER AIR BUILDS IN FROM THE 
WEST. THE TROUGH NOW DROPPING SOUTHWARD OVER THE ROCKIES WILL BE 
RIGHT BEHIND...BRINGING INCREASING CLOUDS AGAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT. QG 
FORCING AND FRONTOGENESIS WILL BE THE MAIN FACTORS FOR LIFT WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...AND THE GFS AND NAM ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THESE 
FEATURES. BOTH POINT TOWARD THE 12-15Z TIME FRAME FOR GREATEST LIFT 
OVER OUR AREA. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS EVERYWHERE AT THIS TIME...WITH 
CHANCE POPS COMING IN LATE TONIGHT...AND AGAIN AS THE SYSTEM EXITS 
MONDAY AFTERNOON. THE FIRST SNOW OF THE SEASON WILL BE POSSIBLE ON 
MOUNTAIN PEAKS ABOVE 5000 FT WITH THE ONSET OF PRECIP LATE 
TONIGHT...BUT NO SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
GENERAL TROUGHING OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL KEEP OUR TEMPERATURES 
AT OR BELOW NORMAL FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...WHILE SHORTWAVES 
CONTINUOUSLY REINFORCING THE LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL KEEP FREQUENT BUT 
NOT OVERLY SIGNIFICANT CHANCES OF PRECIP IN THE FORECAST. THE 
PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO TRANSITION OUT OF TROUGHINESS TO A RIDGING 
SCENARIO ALOFT BY END OF THE WEEK. GFS AND ECMWF AREN'T TOO FAR 
APART ON PROGRESSION OF WESTERN CLOSED LOW...THAT STARTS OFF NEAR 
THE NORTHERN CA COAST PRESENTLY AND VERY SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE 
SOUTHERN ROCKIES ON FRIDAY. CANADIAN HAS A SIMILAR TRACK TIMING. 
GFS/ECMWF OPEN AND MOVE THE LOW TO THE GREAT LAKES BY NEXT SUNDAY 
MORNING. DGEX IS A BIT OF AN OUTLIER WITH A SLOWER SOLUTION... 
KEEPING THE CUTOFF FURTHER WEST LONGER...AND FURTHER BUILDING THE 
EASTERN WARM RIDGE. MAKES ME WONDER. I GENERALLY DID NOT STRAY FROM 
THE CONSENSUS BUT THIS IS THE TIME OF YEAR CUTOFF LOWS LIKE TO BE 
DIFFICULT. BEARS KEEPING AN EYE OPEN. STILL EXPECT THINGS TO BE 
FAIRLY WARM FRI/SAT/PSBLY SUN.

A SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL PUSH ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE REST OF 
THE AFTERNOON. A SHORT PERIOD OF CLEARING MAY COME THIS EVENING
BEFORE CLOUDS INCREASE AGAIN TOWARD MIDNIGHT...FOLLOWED BY RISING
RAIN CHANCES AFTER MIDNIGHT. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL INCREASE AFTER
MIDNIGHT AS A MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES. THE BEST
CHANCES LOOK TO BE IN THE NORTH WHERE THE LIFT WILL BE AIDED BY THE
UPPER JET ACROSS KY/OH AND 500 MB VORTICITY ADVECTION. RAIN CHANCES
WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE SUNDAY AFTERNOON ONCE THE 850-700 MB TROUGH
AXIS MOVES THROUGH...AND ADVECTION OF LOWER THETA-E AIR COMMENCES
AT 850 MB AS A NW FLOW DEVELOPS. TEMPERATURES TOMORROW WILL STAY IN
THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS...WITH SOME LOWER 60S POSSIBLE SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
TROUGHING OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL KEEP OUR TEMPERATURES AT OR 
BELOW NORMAL FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...WHILE SHORTWAVES COMING 
AROUND THE BASE OF THE TROUGH WILL KEEP A FEW QUICK SHOTS OF RAIN IN

AFTERNOON KEEPING CLOUDS AROUND FOR MOST OF THE DAY. THE CLOUD 
CEILINGS WILL KEEP TAFS SITES DOWN TO MVFR CONDITIONS (2-3KFT) 
THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. CLOUD CEILINGS SHOULD BEGIN TO RISE BY

ALSO...OCCASIONAL RAIN WILL DEVELOP AT TRI/TYS BETWEEN 08-12Z. THESE 
SHOWERS WILL BE MORE SCATTERED IN NATURE AT CHA. SHOWERS WILL REDUCE 
VISIBILITIES TO AT LEAST 4-6 MILES AND POSSIBLY LOWER AT TIMES.

FOG SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM TONIGHT AS WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO STAY UP

1027 AM EDT SAT OCT 6 2012

.DISCUSSION...
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FORECAST WILL BE NEEDED THIS MORNING TO ACCOUNT
FOR THE FASTER MOVEMENT OF SHOWERS AND COLD FRONT. THE FRONTAL ZONE
IS CURRENTLY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...WITH SHOWER ACTIVITY
AHEAD OF THE FRONT IN A WEAK 925-700 MB CONVERGENCE ZONE. SATELLITE
SHOWS ONLY LOW CLOUD COVER BEHIND THE FRONT...WITH THE 12Z OHX
SOUNDING SHOWING MOISTURE CONFINED BELOW 800 MB. POPS WILL BE
LOWERED TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. 

EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER THROUGH THE DAY AND BUILDING COLD ADVECTION
WILL KEEP TEMPS NEARLY STEADY OR SLOWLY RISING THROUGH THE DAY AS
CLOUDS DECREASE. THE BACK EDGE OF THE CLOUDS IS PROJECTED TO REACH
THE MOUNTAINS BY AROUND 22Z. SO SOME SUNSHINE WILL COME IN LATE IN
WESTERN SECTIONS. HOURLY TEMPS WILL BE UPDATED TO CAPTURE THIS
TREND BETTER.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IS MOVING EAST ACROSS MIDDLE AND WEST TENNESSEE. THIS 
AREA OF CONVECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH 925-850MB FRONTOGENETIC 
FORCING AS A COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. MODELS 
SHOW THE FORCING ALONG AND WEST OF THE FRONT WEAKENING CONSIDERABLY 
AS IT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. WILL HAVE LIKELY 
CHANCES FOR THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...THEN DECREASING POPS INTO THE 
VALLEY EASTWARD. COOLER AIR WILL SPILL INTO THE FORECAST TODAY..PER
MOS GUIDANCE.

FOR TONIGHT...A FAST MOVING UPPER TROUGH WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY/GREAT LAKES REGION WITH ASSOCIATED UPPER JET PRODUCING 
PRODUCING MODERATELY STRONG LIFT DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF RIGHT 
ENTRANCE REGION. BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE OVER THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL CALL FOR LIKELY/CAT POPS NORTH 
TO HIGH CHANCE POPS SOUTH FOR LATE TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ACTIVE FALL WEATHER PATTERN HAS 
ARRIVED ACROSS THE U.S. THROUGH THE LONG TERM. IT LOOKS LIKE THERE 
WILL BE ABOUT FOUR SYSTEMS TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE 
PERIOD WITH THE FIRST CURRENTLY DROPPING SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS. PREFERRED THE SLOWER NAM SOLUTION WITH THIS SHORT 
WAVE WHICH INDICATES DEEPER MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT IN PLACE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MAINLY DURING THE MORNING WITH 
SHOWERS FADING FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE AFTERNOON. THE NEXT WAVE 
FOLLOWS CLOSE ON THE HEELS OF SUNDAY'S SYSTEM BUT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL 
HAVE A LIMITED IMPACT WITH PRODUCING MAINLY MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
CLOUDS SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THE DEEPEST MOISTURE AND LIFT WITH 
THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO AFFECT EXTREME SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AS WELL AS THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS WHERE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN WAS FORECAST LATE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
APPROXIMATELY MID DAY MONDAY. THE INTERESTING ASPECT OF THIS FAST 
MOVING WAVE IS THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE SYSTEM'S MID LEVEL CLOUD 
DECK MAY REDUCE THE CHANCE OF FROST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTION OF 
THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING. THE UPPER 
LEVEL FLOW TRANSITIONS BACK TO A ZONAL CONFIGURATION LATER MONDAY 
INTO TUESDAY AS A SURFACE HIGH BUILDS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. CLEARING SKIES UNDER DRY COLD ADVECTION MAY LEAD TO 
SOME PATCHY FROST FORMATION ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AND MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING. ANOTHER RELATIVELY WEAK SHORT WAVE AND 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT BUILD ACROSS THE REGION DURING THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY BUT MODELS INDICATE THE SYSTEM LACKS SIGNIFICANT LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE RETURN WITH BETTER UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS FARTHER NORTH SO 
JUST KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS MAINLY NORTH OF I-40 AT 
THIS TIME. MORE SURFACE RIDGING AND DRY ADVECTION IN STORE BEHIND 
THIS SYSTEM ON THURSDAY ALLOWING A RETURN TO SUNSHINE 
HOWEVER...CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE AGAIN THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION STRENGTHENING AHEAD OF ANOTHER COLD 
FRONT. MODELS ARE NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT THIS LATE IN THE 
FORECAST SO JUST STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS ON 
FRIDAY. ADJUSTED MAX/MIN TEMPS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD OF 00Z MEX MOS

A CHANGE IN AIR MASS WILL BEGIN ON SATURDAY AS A COLD FRONT MOVES 
INTO THE AREA. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT...WITH BROKEN TO OVERCAST COVERAGE EXPECTED BY SUNRISE. THE 
CLOUD COVER AND SLIGHT SW WINDS SHOULD PREVENT MUCH FOG DEVELOPMENT. 
RAIN IS EXPECTED TO ENTER THE PLATEAU COUNTIES BEFORE SUNRISE...AND 
SPREAD ACROSS THE TN VALLEY THROUGH THE MORNING. PRECIP AMOUNTS LOOK 
LIGHT AS MID/UPPER LEVEL FORCING IS NOT VERY STRONG AND THE FLOW 
ALOFT REMAINS NEARLY ZONAL. POPS WILL REMAIN IN THE CHANCE RANGE. 
SOUNDINGS SHOW WEAK ELEVATED INSTABILITY...AND WILL JUST MENTION A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS SOUTH. THE COLD FRONT CROSSES THE 
AREA IN THE LATE MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON...AND WILL BE NEAR THE 
MOUNTAINS BY THE EVENING. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
COOLER PATTERN CONTINUES SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY AS UPPER TROUGH 
DIGS SOUTH ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES FROM THE PLAINS TO THE EAST 
COAST. SHORT WAVE MOVES INTO THE MS VALLEY SATURDAY NIGHT AND THEN 
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY. THIS WILL TRIGGER AN INCREASE OF 
SHOWERS LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. BEST CHANCE NORTH. COLD 
AIR ADVECTION WILL HOLD HIGH TEMPERATURES INTO THE 50S NORTH TO 60S 
SOUTH WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES DURING THE DAY. THEN SUNDAY NIGHT 
CLOUDS DECREASE WITH RAIN ENDING. HOWEVER ANOTHER WEAKER SHORT WAVE 
TO MOVE THROUGH LATE SUNDAY NIGHT. BEST MOISTURE SOUTHEAST SO COULD 
SEE A FEW SHOWERS SW NC. BIGGER STORY WILL BE THE LOWS WITH COLD AIR 
ADVECTION AND VARIABLE CLOUD COVER TEMPERATURES STILL EXPECTED TO 
DROP INTO THE MID TO UPPER 30S NORTHERN PLATEAU THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. RIGHT NOW FROST NOT TOO FAVORABLE. MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY TEMPERATURES BEGIN TO WARM AS TROUGH AND SURFACE HIGH 
SHIFT EAST. MONDAY NIGHT LOOKS TO BE THE COLDEST NIGHT AS SKIES 
CLEAR. FROST POSSIBLE IN THE SAME AREAS MENTIONED SUNDAY NIGHT. WEAK 
SYSTEM MOVING SE IN NW FLOW ALOFT WEDNESDAY BRINGS A A THREAT FOR

CURRENT THINKING IS...INCREASING CLOUD COVER SHOULD PREVENT CHA AND 
TYS FROM DEVELOPING FOG...ALONG WITH THE EXPECTED LIGHT WINDS 
OVERNIGHT OUT AHEAD OF THE FRONT. KEPT BOTH CHA AND TYS SITES VFR. 
HOWEVER...CHA COULD GO MVFR FOR A BRIEF PERIOD IF CLOUDS ARE A 
LITTLE LATE TO ARRIVE. CONFIDENCE IS TO LOW AT THIS POINT TO 
MENTION MVFR AT CHA THOUGH.

CLOUD COVER SHOULD ARRIVE A LITTLE LATER AT TRI. CLEARER SKIES AND 
CALM WINDS SHOULD ALLOW ENOUGH TIME FOR SOME FOG TO DEVELOP BEFORE 
CLOUDS ARRIVE. MVFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT AT TRI.

AFTER SOME FOG TO START EXPECT A MAINLY SUNNY DAY TODAY WITH ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES. WITH APPROACHING COLD FRONT CLOUDS WILL START 
TO INCREASE TONIGHT...AND A FEW SHOWERS MAY MAKE IT INTO WESTERN 
AREAS BEFORE SUNRISE.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS LATE TONIGHT 
MOST WESTERN ZONES...EXCEPT LOW CHANCE FAR NORTHWEST PORTION OF

TODAY...SO WILL TWEAK DOWN SLIGHTLY.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODEL FORECASTS FOR THE 
PERIOD NOT VERY FAR APART WITH PREDICTION OF ABOUT THREE SHORT WAVE 
SYSTEMS TRANSITING THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. THE FIRST BUILDS 
EAST ACROSS GREAT LAKES AND NEW ENGLAND WHICH BRINGS A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY. UPPER DYNAMICS RATHER WEAK 
WITH POST FRONTAL LIFT GENERATING A FEW SHOWERS DURING THE DAY WITH 
BETTER CHANCE NORTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS. THERE COULD BE ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY FOR A THUNDERSTORM ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA DURING THE AFTERNOON. A MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORT 
WAVE ROTATES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY SO 
GRADIENT OF LIKELY POPS NORTH THROUGH CHANCE POPS SOUTH FOR SHOWERS. 
COLD AND DRY AIR BUILDS INTO THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY BUT 
SUNSHINE WILL BE BACK ON MONDAY. THE FAIR WEATHER PERIOD SHOULD 
EXTEND THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AS TEMPERATURES REBOUND BACK CLOSER TO 
NORMAL WITH A WARM AIR ADVECTION INCREASING AHEAD OF ANOTHER FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. AT THIS TIME MODELS INDICATE THIS FEATURE WILL BE DRIVEN 
BY A RATHER LOW AMPLITUDE TROUGH WITH DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT NORTH 
OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SO HELD POPS FOR SHOWERS IN THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE. MORE DRY ADVECTION BEHIND DEPARTING MID WEEK

GOOD RAD COOLING OVERNIGHT SHOULD APPROACH FORECAST MINS AND 
ALLOW FOR FOG DEVELOPMENT. SON

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... WITH HIGH PRESSURE SETTLING 
OVER THE AREA AND A DRY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT...CONDITIONS APPEAR 
FAVORABLE FOR FOG DEVELOPMENT TONIGHT. DEWPOINTS THIS AFTERNOON ARE 
IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S...AND LOWS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE UPPER 
40S TO LOWER 50S. CONFIDENCE IN FOG FORMATION IS HIGHEST NORTHEAST. 
WILL MENTION AREAS OF FOG NE WITH PATCHY FOG ELSEWHERE. WILL HOLD 
OFF ON A DENSE FOG ADVISORY...AND LET THE EVENING SHIFT EVALUATE. 
FRIDAY LOOKS SUNNY AND MILD AFTER THE FOG BURNS OFF BY 
MID-MORNING...WITH HIGHS A BIT WARMER THAN TODAY...IN THE UPPER 70S 
TO LOWER 80S.

LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN STORY FOR THIS TIME 
PERIOD WILL BE THE ADVANCEMENT OF THE COLD FRONT THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA...THE ASSOCIATED RAINFALL AND SUBSEQUENT COOLER 
TEMPERATURES OVER THE UPCOMING WEEKEND.

IT WILL CERTAINLY FEEL LIKE FALL AFTER THE COLD FRONT MARCHES INTO 
GEORGIA AND THE CAROLINAS. THE NAM IS ABOUT SIX HOURS SLOWER WITH 
THE FRONTAL PASSAGE THAN THE GFS ON SATURDAY. HOWEVER BOTH MODELS 
SUGGEST THAT THE BEST CHANCES FOR MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION WILL 
OCCUR ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA. IT ALSO APPEARS THAT SHOWERS THAT DEVELOP 
WILL BECOME MORE SCATTERED AS THE DAY PROGRESSES ON SATURDAY. THE 
HEAVIER AND BETTER CHANCES OF RAIN WILL AWAIT THE UPPER TROUGH 
POISED TO BARREL ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY ON SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY. ONCE AGAIN...THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAINFALL WILL BE ACROSS NE 
TN AND SW VA. MOST PRECIPITATION WILL BE N AND E OF THE FORECAST 
AREA BY SUNDAY NIGHT.

WHILE SUNDAY MORNING WILL BE COOL WITH LOWS EXPECTED TO BE NEAR 40 
DEGREES IN SOME PLACES...THE COLDEST MORNING WILL BE MONDAY 
PARTICULARLY OVER PARTS OF THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...NE TN AS WELL AS 
HIGHER TERRAIN IN E TN AND SW VA. THUS THERE WILL BE A POSSIBILITY OF 
FROST FOR THESE AREAS. 

DRY CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL UNTIL LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. 
ANOTHER STRONG TROUGH/SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE OVER THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION SENDING ANOTHER COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA. AT THIS TIME WE 
HAVE MENTIONED ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR NE TN AND SW VA 
BECAUSE THAT WILL BE THE LOCATION OF THE BEST LIFT FOR OUR AREA.

AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP WINDS LIGHT WITH A FEW CLOUDS 
AROUND. VFR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON.

LAST NIGHT...TYS AND TRI DID NOT RECEIVE MUCH FOG DUE TO THE 
LINGERING CLOUD COVER OVERNIGHT AND THROUGH EARLY MORNING. AS 
OPPOSED TO CHA...WHICH RECEIVED CLEAR SKIES AND THUS HAD FOG. 

TONIGHT...CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS WILL FAVOR FOG DEVELOPMENT AT 
ALL THREE TAF SITES. CURRENT DEWPOINTS ARE 61 AT CHA...56 AT 
TYS...AND 56 AT TRI. IF THE DEWPOINTS CONTINUE TO STAY UP...NO 
REASON WHY THEY SHOULD DROP...LOW TEMPERATURE FORECASTS FOR ALL THREE 
SITES ARE EXPECTED TO REACH THE DEWPOINT TEMPS. 

CURRENT THINKING IS...WIDESPREAD FOG IS FAVORABLE DUE TO THE 
AFOREMENTIONED CONDITIONS. CONFIDENCE IS HIGH FOR SEEING AT LEAST 
IFR CONDITIONS AT ALL THREE TAF SITES. FOG WILL BE SLOW TO BURN OFF 
TOMORROW MORNING...SO KEPT FOG IN UNTIL 1400Z FOR ALL THREE SITES.

THIS AFTERNOON AS HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS TODAY. MAY SEE PATCHY FOG
EARLY TODAY BUT NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH FOR AN ADVISORY. WITH THE LESS

DRIZZLE FOLLOWING MAIN PRECIP. WILL NOT MENTION THE DRIZZLE 
YET...JUST THE POP FOR THE RAIN.

MUCH COOLER AIR EXPECTED TO SPILL INTO THE REGION ON SUNDAY AND 
INTO NEXT WEEK. MODELS ALSO AGREE ON A COUPLE OF TRAILING 
SHORTWAVES ON SUNDAY AND INTO MONDAY.  FINALLY BY SUNSET ON MONDAY 
ALL THE SHORTWAVES SHOULD BE PAST. WILL CUT OFF POPS BY SUNDAY 
EVENING AS THE MOISTURE GETS TOO SHALLOW FOR THE LIFT WITH THIS

COLD AND WET AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY...WOULD HAVE GONE 
COLDER IF IT LOOKED FOR SURE TO HANG IN ALL DAY...BUT MIGHT BREAK UP 
LATTER HALF OF THE AFTERNOON.

BOTH SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY NIGHT LOOK PRETTY CHILLY...SUNDAY NIGHT 
AS THE COLDEST AIR SETTLES IN...AND MONDAY NIGHT DUE TO BETTER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
THE DEEP TROUGH OVER THE MS VALLEY TODAY WILL BE LIFTING NORTHEAST 
ACROSS THE TN/OHIO VALLEY REGION TONIGHT AND TOWARD NEW ENGLAND BY 
LATE TOMORROW. DRIER AIR TO OUR WEST WILL BE WORKING ITS WAY EAST AS 
THE TROUGH DEPARTS. WITH LESS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND WITHOUT A 
STRONG INVERSION TO TRAP MOISTURE...WE SHOULD NOT SEE AS MUCH  
CLOUDINESS TONIGHT AS WE DID LAST NIGHT...ESPECIALLY WEST. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE SOME CLOUDS HANGING ON IN EASTERN SECTIONS 
OVERNIGHT JUST AHEAD OF THE TROUGH PASSAGE. PATCHY VALLEY FOG WILL 
BE POSSIBLE IN AREAS THAT BECOME CLEAR. LOWS SHOULD ALSO BE SEVERAL 
DEGREES COOLER.  HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND A NEARLY ZONAL 
MID/UPPER FLOW WILL PROVIDE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES FOR THURSDAY...WITH 
HIGHS IN THE MID 70S NORTH TO LOWER 80S SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
AT THE START OF THIS PERIOD OUR AREA IS UNDER AN UPPER LEVEL ZONAL
FLOW...BETWEEN AN UPPER LOW/TROUGH TO OUR NORTH AND THE SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE TO THE SOUTH. FROM THIS POINT FORWARD INTO THE WEEKEND...500
MB HEIGHTS ARE FALLING AS THE UPPER TROUGH BUILDS SOUTHWARD LATER
IN THE WEEK...AND PUSHES A SURFACE COLD FRONT INTO/THRU THE AREA
ABOUT SATURDAY. MODELS GENERALLY IN GOOD AGREEMENT RIGHT NOW FOR
FROPA ON SATURDAY.

AIRMASS LOOKS ONLY MARGINALLY UNSTABLE WITH THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE...WITH SOME POST-FRONTAL ELEVATED LI VALUES OF -1 TO MAYBE 
-2.  WILL JUST GO WITH SHOWERS FOR NOW SATURDAY AND RAIN SATURDAY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR WAS INDICATING LIGHT
DRIZZLE TO THE NORTH EARLIER ASSOCIATED WITH THE LOW TO THE NORTH.
IT SHOULD CONTINUE TO HEAD OUT OF OUR AREA SO WILL KEEP THE DRY
FORECAST FOR TODAY. CLOUDS OVER THE AREA HAS SLOWED DOWNED FOG
FORMATION THIS MORNING. COULD SEE FOG FORMING EARLY THIS MORNING SO
WILL HANDLE WITH AN SPS. EXPECTING DECREASING CLOUDS...SO GUIDANCE
TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED CLOSE. HIGH PRESSURE
LINGERS OVER THE REGION BRINGING DRY WEATHER TONIGHT. DIDN'T
STRAYED TOO FAR FROM GUIDANCE TEMPERATURE FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A SLOW-MOVING COLD FRONT ON SATURDAY
BRINGING BELOW NORMAL TEMPS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. BEFORE THEN...A
ZONAL UPPER-LEVEL FLOW PATTERN WILL BRING DRY CONDITIONS AND ABOVE
NORMAL TEMPS FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WITH THIS UPPER-LEVEL FLOW
AMPLIFYING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR THE WEEKEND.
MODELS AGREE THAT MOST OF THE PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COLD
FRONT WILL BE BEHIND IT...SO WILL MENTION JUST SHOWERS BEGINNING
LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND LINGERING THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. ANOTHER
UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL ROTATE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON
SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS DISAGREE ABOUT WHETHER
THIS FEATURE WILL HAVE ENOUGH MOISTURE TO PRODUCE PRECIP. FOR
NOW...WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL
INCREASE THE CLOUD COVER WHICH SHOULD KEEP MINS A LITTLE WARMER AS
WELL. HIGH PRESSURE THEN SETTLES OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR EARLY
NEXT WEEK...WITH AREAS OF FROST POSSIBLY DEVELOPING IN THE MORNING
OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. AS FOR TEMPS...TRENDED CLOSE TO
THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL SETTLE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH FRIDAY. FLOW 
ALOFT BECOMES JUST SW OF ZONAL. COOL NIGHTS AND WARM DAYS IN ADVANCE 
OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT. SCATTERED SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE 
ALONG AND IN ADVANCE OF FRONT AS IT MOVES INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY. 
BEST PRECIPITATION CHANCES SAT NIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY FAVORING 
NORTHERN AREAS. LARGE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OF CONTINENTAL CANADA 
SOURCE WILL BUILD SE THROUGH THE CENTRAL U.S. AND EVENTUALLY TO THE

PRODUCE PATCHY DRIZZLE ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT. AS THIS OCCURS

COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ALONG THE SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND 
AL/GA BORDER. AREA RADARS REVEAL A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHEAST TN AND

COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHEASTWARD TODAY...WITH A MARGINALLY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA 
WHERE DECENT HELICITY VALUES WILL STILL RESIDE AHEAD OF THE COLD

BE POSSIBLE TODAY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN BEFORE THE COLD 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY WILL THEN DRIFT EASTWARD

THE ATMOSPHERE STABILIZES. PROBABILITY OF PRECIP WILL BE RATHER HIGH 
FORECAST AREA WIDE TONIGHT BUT WILL ONLY BE IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY 
ON TUESDAY AS THE DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT SHIFTS OFF TO THE EAST. 
WE COULD SEE A FEW SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM OR TWO OVER 
PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY CONTINUES 
TO ROTATE AROUND THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH. TEMPERATURES WILL 
REMAIN MILD TONIGHT WITH A CONTINUATION OF WARM AIR ADVECTION AND 
WILL BE NEAR TO A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL ON TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER TROUGH REMAINS 
WEST OF THE AREA WITH SOUTHERLY JET SEGMENT EXTENDING UP THE 
APPALACHIANS. THE BULK OF THE LAYER MOISTURE WILL MOVE OFF TO THE 
EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS. THE COOLER AREA WILL REMAIN TO THE NW ON 
WEDNESDAY. THE TROUGH AXIS SHIFTS EAST AND WEAKENS WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND THE UPPER FLOW BECOMES JUST SW OF ZONAL FOR THE REST OF THE 
WEEK. COOLER AIR MOVES IN AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WEAKLY BUILDS 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGE WILL BE 
RELATIVELY LARGE WITH DRIER AIRMASS IN PLACE. COOL NIGHTS NEAR 
NORMAL WITH WARM DAYS. RIDGE SHIFTS EAST OVER THE WEEKEND WITH COLD 
FRONT MOVING SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE AREA AROUND SATURDAY EVENING.  
SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED WITH THIS FRONT. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
THEN BUILDS IN FROM THE NW AT END OF PERIOD. LEANED TOWARD THE ECMWF 
TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD. MILD COOL DOWN BEHIND FRONT.

.AVIATION...VARIED FLIGHT CONDITIONS EXIST FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST
ACROSS THE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AS THE ATMOSPHERE QUITE MOIST IN
THE LOW LEVELS AROUND CHA. IN THIS AREA FLIGHT CONDITIONS HAVE BEEN
AND WILL PROBABLY CONTINUE TO BE (FOR AT LEAST ANOTHER COUPLE
HOURS) IFR IN REDUCED VSBY DUE TO RAIN AND FOG WITH CEILINGS AROUND
A THOUSAND FEET OR LOWER. FARTHER NORTHEAST AT TYS AND TRI THE
WARMING AND DRYING EFFECT FROM THE FAST SOUTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE
SMOKY MOUNTAINS IS ALLOWING FOR BETTER FLIGHT CONDITIONS. ALLOWED
FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION AT CHA AND TYS THROUGH EARLY
EVENING AS WARM SECTOR TRIES TO EXPAND NORTH THROUGH THE SOUTHERN
REACHES OF THE GREAT VALLEY. THE ATMOSPHERE IS HAVING A DIFFICULT
TIME DESTABILIZING IN THIS AREA DUE TO AN APPARENT LOW LEVEL...DOWN
VALLEY FLOW FORCED BY THE MODEST SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT. PLACED
SOME MVFR/IFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS IN LOW CEILINGS AND FOG AT THE

.DISCUSSION...CURRENT FORECAST BASICALLY ON TRACK AS SHORT WAVE 
IMPULSES ROTATE AROUND AMPLIFIED MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LONG WAVE 
TROUGH. ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW WILL SHIFT VERY SLOWLY NORTHEAST INTO 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OF ALABAMA BY EARLY EVENING. PLUME OF DEEP 
MOISTURE CONTINUES TO STREAM NORTH OUT OF THE GULF. THIS AXIS OF 
DEEP MOISTURE WILL EDGE SLOWLY FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY. GREATER RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE REALIZED ON THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA. WOULD EXPECT A BIT OF A RAIN SHADOW FARTHER 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY WHERE FAST FLOW ACROSS THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN SHOULD LEAD TO LIGHTER RAINFALL AMOUNTS FROM NEAR KNOXVILLE 
TO THE TRI-CITIES. SOME CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE DURING THE AFTERNOON 
AS TEMPERATURES WARM WITH SOME BREAKS IN THE LOW OVERCAST. THE BEST 
CHANCE FOR THUNDER WOULD BE ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THE ADIABATIC WARMING MAY HELP TO BOOST 
MAX TEMPS CLOSER TO FORECAST HIGHS ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA DESPITE DEEP MOIST AXIS BUILDING INTO THIS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER CENTRAL MS...WITH A WEST-TO-EAST 
ORIENTED WARM FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY AHEAD OF THIS WARM FRONT...WITH SOME STRONG CONVECTION 
OCCURRING FURTHER SOUTH ALONG THE GULF COAST. MODELS AGREE THAT A 
STRONG VEERING WIND PROFILE WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AS THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SLOWLY DRIFTS 
NORTHEASTWARD INTO MIDDLE TN TONIGHT. A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS 
AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT. NAM MODEL INDICATES 
MORE INSTABILITY THAN THE GFS MODEL...MAINLY DUE THE NAM MODEL'S 
WARMER SURFACE TEMPS. WITH BOTH MODELS AGREEING THAT VERY HIGH LOW- 
LEVEL HELICITY VALUES (0-1 KM VALUES IN EXCESS OF 350 M2/S2) WILL 
SPREAD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT...IT APPEARS THAT 
THERE WILL BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR SEVERE STORMS WITH DAMAGING WINDS 
AND ISOLATED TORNADOES POSSIBLE. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE REVEALING SOME LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH MAXES FOR 
TODAY...BUT ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT. SINCE IT 
APPEARS THAT THERE WON'T BE TOO MANY BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER... 
WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE WITH HIGHS FOR TODAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE UPPER-LOW WILL CONTINUE TO 
PUSH NORTHWARD ALONG THE LOWER AND MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY ON 
TUESDAY AND EVENTUALLY WELL INTO THE GREAT LAKES BY WEDNESDAY 
EVENING. GIVEN THE MOISTURE IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION AND AN 
INTENSIFYING JET ROTATING OVER EASTERN TENNESSEE PROVIDING LIFT... 
SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY ON TUESDAY...PARTICULARLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE MOUNTAINS. SOME 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING WILL BE POSSIBLE IN LOCATIONS 
THAT RECEIVE TRAINING AND THE HEAVIEST BURSTS OF RAINFALL. BY THE 
AFTERNOON/EVENING...DRY SLOTTING WILL BEGIN TO TAKE PLACE RESULTING 
IN PRECIPITATION WANING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST AFTER 00Z 
WEDNESDAY. SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS STORM 
SYSTEM WILL KEEP SOME LINGERING CLOUD COVER AND A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
PERHAPS A STRAY SHOWER OR TWO ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...BY THURSDAY 
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL RETURN BRIEFLY...RESULTING IN DRIER AND WARMER 
CONDITIONS FOR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. 

THEREAFTER...ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM OVER THE NORTHERN CONUS IS PROGGED 
TO DRIVE ANOTHER FRONT INTO THE REGION THIS WEEKEND...THOUGH THE 
EXACT TIMING AND TRACK OF THIS IS STILL SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN. THIS 
FRONT WILL SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME SHOWERS AS CLOUD COVER 
INCREASES AND COOLER HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 60 TO LOWER 70S 
ARE EXPECTED. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TIMING AND TRACK...HAVE

QUICKLY OVERNIGHT. THUS...POPS WERE NUDGED UPWARDS ACROSS THE BOARD
AND I INCLUDED A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS LATE FOR SE TN/SW NC
WHERE AT LEAST SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY MAY DEVELOP PRIOR TO 12Z

SE-S WINDS OF PROBABLY JUST 15 TO 30 MPH DEVELOPING. MTN WAVE

LAYER ALOFT AND UPPER JET INTERACTION LACKING. THUS...FOR NOW I
KEPT SPEEDS IN THE MTNS AT 15-25 MPH AND GUSTS TO 35 MPH.

IF WARM FRONT WERE TO MOVE NE INTO OUR FORECAST AREA THEN A WIDER
THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS FOR MONDAY. HOWEVER...I DO EXPECT THE WARM
FRONT TO BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO CREATE SOME DECENT ELEVATED INSTABILITY
COUPLED WITH IMPRESSIVE SHEAR/HELICITY. SO...A MENTION OF STRONG TO
SEVERE STORMS WAS ADDED FOR SE TN/SW NC. 

TRACK OF THE UPPER AND SURFACE LOW MAY VARY A BIT...AND THERE MAY
BE A BRIEF DRY SLOT OCCURRING MONDAY NIGHT OR EARLY TUESDAY. I KEPT
POPS JUST ABOUT UNCHANGED FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...BUT I DID
ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY AFTERNOON (IF CLOUDS
DO BREAK AND SOME SUNSHINE MIXES IN). THE SLIGHT DRYING ON TUESDAY
IS WHY THE MOS TEMPS ARE MUCH WARMER FOR HIGHS TUESDAY...AND I
TRENDED CLOSER TO THESE LATEST MOS MAXES.

OTHERWISE...DID NOT SEE ANY REASON TO HIGHLIGHT HEAVY RAINS OR
FLOODING ANY MORE THAN IN CURRENT HWO PRODUCT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER SOUTHEAST TX...WITH A SLIGHTLY 
DRIER AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA COMPARED TO THIS TIME 
YESTERDAY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF HIGH 
CLOUDS OVER THE DEEP SOUTH AHEAD OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...WHICH 
WERE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY. OVERALL... 
INCREASING CLOUDINESS WILL BE THE TREND TODAY...AS THIS LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE DEEP SOUTH BY TONIGHT. A STRONG 
WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN AHEAD OF THIS LOW WILL HELP TO GENERATE A 
LARGE AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN OVER THE FORECAST AREA LATE 
TONIGHT. THUS...WILL MENTION FAIRLY HIGH POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA...MAINLY FOR AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A STABLE AIR MASS OVER THE MOUNTAINS LATE 
TONIGHT TOWARDS SUNRISE...ALONG WITH A DECENT VEERING WIND PROFILE 
AND LOW-LEVEL WINDS PERPENDICULAR TO THE MOUNTAINS. THUS...THINK 
THAT SOME MOUNTAIN WAVE ACTIVITY COULD POSSIBLY DEVELOP IN THE 
FOOTHILLS AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AND INTO EARLY MONDAY MORNING. WITH 
THE MODELS AGREEING THAT THE 850 MB WINDS WILL ONLY BE AROUND 20 TO 
25 KT JUST WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS...THINK THAT ANY MOUNTAIN WAVE 
INDUCED WINDS IN THE FOOTHILLS SHOULD BE ADVISORY LEVEL AT MOST. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK FROM THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI 
RIVER VALLEY...INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. THIS STORM SYSTEM WILL PROVIDE THE REGION WITH 
THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THAT 
TIME PERIOD. AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM...VERY MOIST GULF AIR WILL ADVECT 
INTO THE REGION. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT PWATS WILL BE 
UNSEASONABLY HIGH AOA 1.75 TO 2.0 INCHES AREAWIDE. THIS...COMBINED 
WITH THE STRONG UPPER-LEVEL LIFT...A DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER...AND 
SOME APPRECIABLE ELEVATED INSTABILITY SUGGEST THE POTENTIAL FOR 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL ACROSS THE REGION. ENHANCING THIS 
THREAT...AND THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAINING CELLS WILL BE A STRONG 
LOW-LEVEL JET THAT IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP MONDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING /SETTING UP PARALLEL TO AN SLOWLY ADVANCING COLD FRONT FROM 
THE WEST/. GIVEN THIS...FEEL THAT THE POTENTIAL WILL EXIST FOR 
WIDESPREAD HEAVY RAINFALL AND LOCALIZED FLOODING AND HAVE KEPT A 
MENTION OF THIS IN THE HWO. 

ADDITIONALLY...THE STRONG JET DYNAMICS WILL CREATE A VERY STRONG 
BULK SHEAR PROFILE...ALLOWING FOR GOOD STORM ORGANIZATION SHOULD 
INSTABILITY PARAMETERS BE SUFFICIENT. OF PARTICULAR NOTE ARE THE 0-1 
KM SHEAR VALUES AOA 25 KTS...WHICH COMBINED WITH THE STRONGLY BACKED 
WINDS AT THE SURFACE RESULT IN A NICELY CURVED HODOGRAPH... 
INDICATING GOOD SPEED AND DIRECTIONAL SHEAR AT THE LOW-LEVELS. THIS 
COMBINED WITH SOME APPRECIABLE INSTABILITY PARAMETERS /INCLUDING 
HELICITY VALUES BTWN 200-450 M2/S2 WITHIN THE WARM SECTOR/...A 
THREAT FOR SOME SUPERCELLS WITH PERSISTENT ROTATING UPDRAFTS WILL 
EXIST THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS ON MONDAY. AS A RESULT...THE 
POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WEATHER...INCLUDING TORNADOES AND DAMAGING 
WINDS WILL EXIST...PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ZONES WHICH WILL 
LIKELY BE IN THE VICINITY OF A NORTHWARD ADVANCING WARM FRONT. 

BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING...MODELS BEGIN TO SHOW SOME DRY 
SLOTTING TAKING PLACE AS THE SYSTEM PULLS EAST OF THE REGION. SOME 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE MAY RESULT IN LINGERING SHOWERS AND CLOUD COVER 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...BEFORE SOME CLEARING TAKES PLACE AS 
THE SYSTEM PULLS EAST. A BRIEF PERIOD OF ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL 
RESULT IN DRY CONDITIONS FOR THURSDAY BEFORE ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN CONUS DRAGS A FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA 
FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTIES IN THE TIMING AND

.AVIATION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
SOUTHEAST TX...WITH A SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
COMPARED TO THIS TIME YESTERDAY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE DEEP SOUTH AHEAD OF THIS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM...WHICH WERE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY. THESE HIGH CLOUDS WILL LIKELY INHIBIT MUCH FOG FORMATION AT 
THE TAF SITES THIS MORNING...ALTHOUGH SOME TEMPORARY IFR 
VISIBILITIES APPEAR POSSIBLE AT KTRI SINCE LIGHT FOG IS ALREADY 
BEING REPORTED. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A VERY DRY AIR MASS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY...WITH MOSTLY HIGH CLOUDS AFFECTING THE 
TAF SITES UNTIL AFTER SUNSET WHEN CEILINGS SHOULD BEGIN TO LOWER. 
OUTSIDE OF SOME MORNING FOG AT KTRI...VFR CONDITIONS AND LIGHT WINDS 
ARE EXPECTED FOR MOST OF THE TAF PERIOD AT ALL THREE TAF SITES.

.DISCUSSION...SHOWERS HAVE ABOUT ENDED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
THIS EVENING WITH SKIES BEGINNING TO CLEAR AND DRIER AIR FILTERING
INTO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS EVENING.
WITH THE RAINFALL ACROSS THE NORTHEAST SECTIONS AND COOLING
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT EXPECT DENSE FOG IN PLACES ACROSS THIS AREA
AND POSSIBLY CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS. NOT AS CONFIDENT ACROSS
SOUTHERN AREAS AS HIGH CLOUDS SPREADING IN FROM GULF COAST SYSTEM.
IF CLOUDS THIN FOG MAY FORM LATER TONIGHT. MAY NEED TO ISSUE DENSE
FOG ADVISORY LATER TONIGHT FOR AT LEAST NORTHERN SECTIONS. REMOVED
RAIN CHANCES REST OF NIGHT FOR ALL BUT EASTERN MOUNTAINS WHICH MAY
HAVE A FEW SHOWERS NEXT COUPLE HOURS. ALSO LOWER LOW TEMPERATURES A
DEGREE SOUTH AND A FEW DEGREES NORTH AS TEMPERATURES EXTREME NORTH
ALREADY IN THE 50S. UPDATE ALREADY SENT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SHOWERS LINGER ACROSS
MAINLY THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...
ALTHO SATELLITE PICS SHOW THE ENHANCED/COOLER TOPS OFF TO OUR EAST. 
WATER VAPOR PICS SHOW SOME DRIER AIR MOVING IN...WHICH COULD LEAD
TO AREAS OF FOG LATER TONIGHT...INCLUDING DENSE FOG WITH VISBYS 1/4
MILE OR LESS. DEW POINT TEMPS CONTINUE TO RUN A FEW DEGREES ABOVE
MOS...SO I WENT A BIT ABOVE THE GFS MOS MINS. 

GFS AND ENSEMBLES...AS WELL AS MOST OTHER MODELS...ARE MORE IN LINE
ON TIMING THE DEVELOPING UPPER LOW OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY REGION
SUNDAY NIGHT. ECMWF WAS QUICKEST BUT NOT PREFERRED...STILL HAD TO
INCREASE POPS FROM THE SW SUNDAY NIGHT AND WENT AHEAD WITH SOME
CATEGORICAL POPS ON MONDAY. LAPSE RATES MONDAY ARE QUITE MOIST...
SO LESS INSTABILITY WHICH FAVORS JUST ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS.
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS COULD OCCUR...ALTHO SOME AREAS COULD SEE A
BRIEF DOWNSLOPE PERIOD IF LOW LEVEL JET IS FROM THE SE.  

GFS MOS TEMPS WERE QUITE REASONABLE FOR THESE PERIODS AND CLOSELY
FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS RELATIVELY 
SIMILAR IN DEPICTION OF SLOW MOVING AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
PROGRESSION FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE EASTERN 
LAKES/CENTRAL APPALACHIANS WITH SURFACE LOW PRESSURE CENTER DRAGGING 
COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY. USED LIKELY POPS MONDAY NIGHT EDGING BACK TO GOOD CHANCE TO 
LOW LIKELY CATEGORY DURING THE DAY TUESDAY AS A DRY SLOT BUILDS IN 
BEHIND THE MAIN SYSTEM. UPPER LEVEL ENERGY TRAILS BEHIND THE SURFACE 
SYSTEM TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WITH ASSOCIATED AXIS OF HIGHER 
MEAN RELATIVE HUMIDITY SO KEPT SOME TOKEN SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS 
IN HERE. KEPT WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY DRY WITH A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF CONVECTION BACK IN THE FORECAST FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
ALTHOUGH AT THIS REMOTE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST THERE ARE TIMING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE MODELS...THUS THE LOW PROBABILITY. ADJUSTED MAX 
TEMPS A FEW DEGREES LOWER DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD. MOS APPEARED 
TO BE A LITTLE TOO OPTIMISTIC ON WARMING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
DEWPOINTS STILL IN THE 60S...ALTHOUGH THE ISOBARS WOULD SUGGEST THAT 
A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WAS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA OVER THE 
CAROLINAS AND NORTHERN GA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS 
MOIST AIR MASS WILL COMBINE WITH AN AMPLIFYING UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER 
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION TO PRODUCE A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION 
SOME SCATTERED LINGERING CONVECTION TODAY...BUT MID LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES APPEAR TO BE WEAK ENOUGH TO KEEP THIS CONVECTION FROM BECOMING 
TOO STRONG. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE POSSIBLE 
THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS TONIGHT...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AXIS 
MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL 
COMPROMISE WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL 
EXIST IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS A STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE OUT OF TEXAS INTO THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI... 
AND EVENTUALLY THE TENNESSEE VALLEY EARLY NEXT WEEK. ATTM...MODELS 
ARE IN GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT WITH THE INITIAL TRACK...THOUGH THERE 
IS STILL SOME VARIABILITY WITH THE EXACT INTENSITY AND EVOLUTION OF 
THE SYSTEM. REGARDLESS...DEEP GULF MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO STREAM 
INTO THE REGION AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM ON SUNDAY. THEN AS LIFT 
INCREASES WITH THE APPROACHING TROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY...AREAS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AND 
OVERSPREAD THE REGION FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. ALL INDICATIONS 
ARE THERE FOR ANOTHER POTENTIAL HEAVY RAIN EVENT ACROSS THE AREA 
BEGINNING SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY BEFORE BEGINNING TO WIND DOWN TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A DEEP WARM CLOUD 
LAYER...SEASONABLY HIGH PWAT VALUES AOA 1.75-2.0 INCHES AND SOME 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY. THIS COMBINED WITH AN INCREASING LOW-LEVEL JET 
SETTING UP PARALLEL TO A COLD FRONT PUSHING TO INTO THE REGION WILL 
CERTAINLY ALLOW FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAINING AND FOR SOME 
LOCALIZED FLOODING CONCERNS. AS A RESULT...WILL MAKE A MENTION OF 
THIS IN THE HWO. 

GIVEN ALL THIS...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY FOR MOST OF THE AREA 
MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES FAVORING THE FAR 
SOUTHERN ZONES AND THE MOUNTAINS. MODELS SHOW THE PRECIPITATION 
SHIFTING OUT OF THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY MORNING AS THE SYSTEM PULLS 
EAST. THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME DRIER WEATHER FOR THE LATTER HALF OF 
THE WORK WEEK AS A BRIEF PERIOD OF ZONAL FLOW BEGINS TO SET UP 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN UNITED STATES. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A FEW 
DEGREES COOLER THAN GUIDANCE THROUGH MOST OF THE EXTENDED GIVEN THE 
EXPECTED CLOUD COVER/PRECIPITATION CHANCES...SO HAVE GENERALLY GONE 
SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE WITH TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT SEEMS TO BE
STILL HANGING ACROSS NRN HALF OF KY THIS AFTERNOON...WHILE
SHORTWAVE HAS TRACKED ENE TOWARD THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. COVERAGE
OF CONVECTION HAS GENERALLY BEEN SCATTERED OR LESS AFTER AN INITIAL
BAND MOVED ACROSS SW VA EARLIER. DAYTIME HEATING AND THE
APPROACHING WEAK COLD FRONT WILL JUSTIFY CHANCE POPS (HIGHEST SW
VA/NRN TN) THRU THIS EVENING...ALTHO I DID LOWER POPS TO SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR SE TN/SW NC. REMOVED THUNDERSTORMS AFTER MIDNIGHT AND
KEPT LOW POPS FOR ANY LINGERING SHOWERS OVERNIGHT. FAVORED A DEGREE
OR SO ABOVE THE COOLER GFS MOS ON MIN TEMPS.

FOR LATER PERIODS...UPPER LOW DROPPING SOUTH INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION SHOULD FINALLY PUSH THE COLD FRONT THROUGH THE SOUTHERN  
APPALACHIANS BY SATURDAY EVENING (PERHAPS NOT AS FAST FRONTAL PROGS 
SUGGEST). GFS MODEL WAS ONLY MEDIUM-LONG RANGE MODEL DEVELOPING RAIN 
AGAIN BY SUNDAY...SO I STAYED WITH A MOSTLY DRY FORECAST FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY (IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND NWS 
NEIGHBORS). MOS TEMPS FAIRLY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS AND GENERALLY 
FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN 
AGREEMENT DURING THE LONG TERM PERIOD BUT GENERALLY INDICATE UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS GETS PICKED UP BY DEEP 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. UPPER LOW AND MAKES SLOW PROGRESS INTO THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON MONDAY. WHILE THIS HAPPENS A SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFTS NORTH EAST FROM THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY 12Z TUESDAY. PLENTY OF 
LIFT AND DEEP MOISTURE TRANSPORT EXPECTED SO CRANKED UP POPS FROM 
CHANCE TO LIKELY CATEGORY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND WITH VERY 
SLOW PROGRESSION OF THE MID LATITUDE CYCLONE KEPT LIKELY POPS GOING 
INTO MONDAY NIGHT WHILE DROPPING PROBABILITY FROM WEST TO EAST LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS THE MAIN BULK OF THE STORM SYSTEM 
BUILDS NORTH AND EAST AWAY FROM THE REGION. HAD TO HOLD ONTO SLIGHT 
THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE POP FROM WEST TO EAST TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY WITH MODELS VERY SLOW TO SWING WEAKENING TROUGH EAST OF 
THE APPALACHIANS. THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE WITH 
RATHER LOW FORECAST CONFIDENCE WITH ECMWF AND GFS OUT OF PHASE WITH 
ECMWF SHOWING ZONAL FLOW WITH GFS INDICATING A DEEP EASTERN STATES 
TROUGH. WENT WITH THE NEIGHBORS TO THE WEST SOLUTION WHICH FOLLOWS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
SOUTHWEST-TO-NORTHEAST ORIENTED COLD FRONT OVER KENTUCKY...WITH A 
WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLD FRONT IS 
PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TODAY... 
AS A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER SOUTHERN CANADA SINKS SOUTHWARD 
TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A 
MARGINALLY TO POSSIBLY MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP 
THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...WILL MENTION SCATTERED 
CONVECTION AREAWIDE...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF 
OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL WINDS SHOULD SUPPORT 
A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW IS PROGGED TO 
FURTHER AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION TONIGHT AS THE 
CANADIAN UPPER LOW SINKS SOUTHWARD...SO WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION 
SCATTERED CONVECTION THROUGH THE NIGHT WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS EXPECTED TO LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE 
TO NUDGE SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE REGION ON SATURDAY IN RESPONSE TO A 
DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ROTATING OVER LAKE HURON 
AND SOUTHERN ONTARIO. SOME APPRECIABLE FRONTAL-GENETIC FORCING AND 
SOME UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT FROM THE AFOREMENTIONED STORM SYSTEM WILL 
PROMOTE A SOLID CHANCE FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS DURING THE 
DAY. AFTER SUNSET...THE FRONT IS PROGGED TO DROP SOUTHWARD INTO 
NORTHERN ALABAMA...RESULTING IN PRECIP CHANCES BEGINNING TO WANE 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AS THE COOLER/DRIER POST FRONTAL AIRMASS 
SEEPS INTO THE FORECAST AREA FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. HOWEVER...GIVEN 
SOME UNCERTAINTY IN EXACTLY HOW FAR SOUTH THE FRONT WILL MOVE...HAVE 
KEPT SOME LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ZONES THROUGH 
SUNDAY NIGHT.

THEREAFTER...ANOTHER DEEPENING UPPER-TROUGH IS PROGGED TO SWING OUT 
OF TEXAS AND INTO THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI AND EVENTUALLY TENNESSEE 
VALLEY BY THE EARLY TO MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL PROVIDE 
THE AREA WITH REASONABLE CHANCES FOR SCATTERED TO PERHAPS WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS AND STORMS AS ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE BEGINS TO STREAM BACK 
INTO THE REGION. THOUGH THE LONG RANGE MODELS HAVE GENERALLY COME

.AVIATION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A SOUTHWEST-TO-NORTHEAST ORIENTED 
COLD FRONT OVER KENTUCKY...WITH A WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS MOIST AIR MASS SHOULD ALLOW FOG TO DEVELOP AGAIN 
AT KTRI AND KTYS TOWARDS SUNRISE...BUT EXPECT A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE 
AREA OF HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY TO KEEP IT FROM 
BECOMING TOO DENSE. THE COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE 
SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
OVER SOUTHERN CANADA SINKS SOUTHWARD AND STRENGTHENS OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION. THIS UPPER LOW WILL COMBINE WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
TO GENERATE SCATTERED CONVECTION AROUND THE TAF SITES LATE THIS 
MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION VCTS AT 
KTRI AND KTYS WHERE THE PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION IS GREATEST. 
OUTSIDE OF SOME MORNING FOG AND SCATTERED LATE MORNING/AFTERNOON 
CONVECTION...VFR CONDITIONS WITH LIGHT WINDS ARE EXPECTED FOR MOST 
OF THE TAF PERIOD AT ALL THREE TAF SITES.

DISSIPATED...WITH ONLY A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS LEFT WELL TO OUR
NORTH NEAR THE FRONT. THE 00Z OHX SOUNDING DOES SHOW SOME WEAK
INSTABILITY THAT MAY HELP MAINTAIN THESE SHOWERS AS THEY

NORTHERN AREAS. WILL LOWER POPS TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH
TONIGHT. THERE WILL BE A PERIOD OF CLEAR SKIES THROUGH AROUND

SOUTHWARD INTO OUR AREA.

MVFR CONDITIONS ARE FORECAST TONIGHT AT TRI AND TYS. BRIEF PERIOD OF

OVERNIGHT...THUS KEEPING US A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT. IF 
SKY CONDITIONS BECOME CLEARER THAN EXPECTED...IFR CONDITIONS ARE

BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS FURTHER NORTH TOWARD TRI FOR TOMORROW

SEEMS TO BE HANGING ACROSS EXTREME SRN IL AND SRN IN. AIRMASS OVER 
OUR FORECAST AREA HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE...SO I WILL CARRY 
GENERALLY LOW POPS (IN LINE WITH MOS) FOR TONIGHT. LIFTED INDICES 
ARE STABLE AFTER 06Z FRIDAY SO I SWITCHED BACK TO JUST SHOWERS THRU 
12Z. MIN TEMPS SHOULD FALL CLOSER TO A MOS BLEND.

BASED ON NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT FRIDAY...NOT SURE IF COLD FRONT 
DROPS QUITE SO FAST SOUTHWARD...AS ADVERTISED AGAIN. THUS...I KEPT 
OUR LIKELY POPS N AND CENTRAL WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR SE TN/SW NC. 
OTHERWISE...MODELS WERE CONSISTENT AND IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS 
FORECAST GRIDS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...ACTIVE EXTENDED 
FORECAST WITH BOTH A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH 
EFFECTING THE AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...A
FAIRLY DEEP UPPER TROUGH WILL SWEEIP ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES 
AND UPPER OHIO VALLEY PROVIDING THE EMPHASIS TO PULL A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. FAIRLY DECENT FRONTAL-GENETIC 
FORCING ANTICIPATED SATURDAY SO WILL CONTINUE POPS THROUGH THE DAY.

FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...COOLER AND DRIER AIR FILTERS INTO THE AREA ENDING 
THE PRECIPITATION. 

SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH OVER TEXAS WILL LIFT NORTHEAST TOWARD 
THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FOR TUESDAY THROUGH THRUSDAYINTO THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE IS STILL HOLDING
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA NOW CENTERED JUST EAST OF THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. A COLD FRONT JUST NORTH OF THE OHIO VALLEY MOVES
SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER INTO KY AND VIRGINIA TODAY THEN SLOWLY
EDGES SOUTH INTO NORTHERN TN AND SW VA OVERNIGHT TONIGHT. SHORT
WAVE ENERGY AHEAD OF THE FRONT TO FOLLOW CLOSE TO AND JUST SOUTH OF
THE OHIO VALLEY THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON WITH SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING AS THE AIR MASS HEATS UP. BEST
INSTABILITY STAYS NORTH AND WEST OF THE REGION TODAY AND TONIGHT SO
THUNDERSTORMS NOT EXPECTING TO BE STRONG. RIGHT NOW ACROSS MIDDLE
KY AND TN JUST A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS ARE SEEN ON RADAR. SKIES ARE
CLEAR ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH PATCHY FOG IN SOME NE TN AND SW
VA VALLEYS. AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER SOUTHERN MO
AND WESTERN KY IS MOVING INTO A MORE STABLE AIR MASS SO SHOULD
WEAKEN THIS MORNING. MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL SLOWLY INCREASE
DURING THE DAY ACROSS THE CWA BUT ONLY AFFECT HIGHS SLIGHTLY. STILL
EXPECT TEMPERATURES ABOUT THE SAME AS TUESDAY AND SLIGHTLY WARMER
SOUTH WHERE THERE SHOULD BE LESS CLOUD COVER. TONIGHT WITH THE
FRONT CLOSER EXPECT SCATTERED SHOWERS AND SOME THUNDERSTORMS TO
CONTINUE WITH BETTER COVERAGE THAN DURING THE DAY TODAY. GENERALLY
FOLLOWED A BLEND OF MET AND MAV GUIDANCE FOR LOWS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALONG 
NORTH END OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL BEGIN TO MOVE SOUTH INTO THE
MRX CWA FRIDAY. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL AID PROLONGED PRECIPITATION
PARALLEL TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY AS IT SHIFTS INTO E TN. BROAD
NEGATIVELY TILTED UPPER TROUGH OVER SE CANADA DRIFTS SW WITH BASE
MAKING ITS WAY INTO W TN VALLEY. THIS CONTINUES THROUGH THE WEEKEND
AS FRONT SLOWLY PUSHES SE OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS EARLY
SUNDAY. PRECIPITATION CHANCES MAY BE UNDERDONE OVER THE WEEKEND BUT
LAYER MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO DROP OFF ON NW SIDE OF JET AXIS AT
BASE OF UPPER TROUGH. EARLY NEXT WEEK STARTS OFF RELATIVELY DRY
WITH DEEP MOISTURE SOUTH OF THE AREA. WEAK UPPER LOW SLOWLY
DEVELOPS OVER THE LOWER MS RVR VALLEY THROUGH THE MID WEEK.
INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WORKS NORTH INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
BY END OF PERIOD. THIS SETS UP FOR A WET PERIOD FOR THE LATER PART
OF NEXT WEEK. BRIEF COOLING BEHIND FRONT MID PERIOD BUT OVERALL

POPS FOR LATE TONIGHT ACROSS SW VA AND FAR NRN COUNTIES OF E TN. I 
ADDED PATCHY LATE NIGHT FOG FOR AROUND TRI AND A FEW SPOTS OVER SE

TREND OVER THE PAST FEW NIGHTS...I FAVORED A BIT CLOSER TO A MOS

FRONT DOES NOT MAKE MUCH OF A SOUTHWARD PUSH ON THURSDAY...SO JUST 
KEPT 20 TO 30 PERCENT POPS ACROSS NRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
THE AFTERNOON HOURS. MOS BLEND FOR MAX TEMPS SEEMED MORE REASONABLE 
DUE TO AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS ALONG WITH THE LOW POPS. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A STALLED FRONTAL
BOUNDARY JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL FINALLY MOVE SOUTH
INTO THE REGION FRIDAY. THE FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH DUE TO A SHORT-

GFS AND NAM ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MODERATE CAPE WITH VALUES UP
TO 1800 J/KG. DECENT FRONTAL-GENETIC FORCING ALONG THE BOUNDARY
WILL BE ABLE TO PRODUCE LIKELY POPS OVER MOST OF THE REGON FRIDAY
WITH CHANCES POPS (MAINLY SOUTH) SATURDAY. AT THIS TIME... WIND
FIELDS AND INSTABILITY DO NOT FAVOR ORGANIZED SEVERE STORMS...BUT
ISOLATED STRONG THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE.

FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY...UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE NORTHEAST
UNITED STATES WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIRMASS. FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...

OVER THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES INTO THE CENTRAL STATES. AHEAD OF
THIS SYSTEM A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUED
OVERNIGHT FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS EXTENDING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE
OHIO VALLEY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER THE FORECAST AREA
WITH UPPER LEVEL RIDGING IN THE SOUTHEAST KEEPING MOST OF THE DENSE
CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH
TODAY. VARIABLE MAINLY HIGH CLOUDS WILL AFFECT THE NORTHERN SECTIONS
BUT AS THE SURFACE HIGH CENTER SHIFTS TO OFF THE EAST COAST SOUTH
TO SOUTHWEST WINDS AND MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES WILL WARM TEMPERATURES
SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE TUESDAYS HIGHS. ALSO CURRENT TEMPERATURES
THIS MORNING ARE MOSTLY IN THE LOWER 50S MOUNTAINS AND NE VALLEYS
TO UPPER 50S TO MID 60S SOUTH. THESE TEMPERATURES ARE 10 TO 15 DEGREES
WARMER THAN FROM TUESDAY MORNING. TONIGHT THE FRONT WILL PROGRESS A
LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH BUT SKIES STAY PARTLY CLOUDY WITH A FEW
SHOWERS POSSIBLE ONLY ACROSS SW VA. LOWS AGAIN MILD TONIGHT MOSTLY
NEAR 60 EXCEPT MOUNTAINS AND COOLER NE VALLEYS.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...STALLED FRONT CONTINUES 
NORTH OF THE AREA WITH ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. TEMPERATURES REMAIN WARM. 
PREFRONTAL PRECIPITATION WILL ADVANCE ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS. BROAD

APPALACHIANS. FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE SOUTH THROUGH THE AREA 
SATURDAY. MODELS DIFFER ON STRENGTH OF DEVELOPING UPPER LOW OVER THE

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
A BIT OF A TRICKY FORECAST FOR THE VERY NEAR TERM AS THE REMNANTS OF 
AN MCS CONTINUE TO PUSH ACROSS EASTERN KENTUCKY THIS AFTERNOON. 
WHILE THIS ACTIVITY HAS GENERALLY REMAINED NORTH OF THE KY/TN STATE 
BORDER...SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE BEGUN TO WORK THEIR WAY INTO 
SOUTHWEST VA. THIS COMPLEX HAS MAINTAINED ITSELF FOR MUCH OF THE DAY 
THANKS TO SOME ENHANCED MUCAPE VALUES ACROSS MIDDLE TN/CENTRAL KY 
AND A 850 JET DRAPED ACROSS WESTERN/MIDDLE TN. GIVEN THE MUCH MORE 
STABLE AND DRIER ENVIRONMENT EAST OF THE INTERSTATE 75 CORRIDOR...AM 
EXPECTING A GENERAL WEAKENING TREND TO CONTINUE HEADING INTO THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HOWEVER...THE AFOREMENTIONED JET TO THE WEST 
COULD HELP TO MAINTAIN THIS ACTIVITY SOMEWHAT ALONG KY/TN 
BORDER...SW VIRGINIA AND BACK ALONG THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
THROUGH THE EVENING. 

OVERNIGHT...DECKS OF MID/HIGH CLOUDS WILL PERSIST ACROSS MOST OF THE 
REGION AND ALONG WITH SOME LIGHT SOUTHERLY WINDS SHOULD HELP TO KEEP 
LOWS A FEW DEGREES WARMER...IN THE 50S GENERALLY AREAWIDE. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO SHOW CONVECTION FIRING ALONG A FRONT ALONG THE OHIO 
RIVER TOMORROW...BUT ALL SOLUTIONS SHOW IT REMAINING DISPLACED WELL 
NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. STILL...IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT MODELS 
DID A FAIRLY POOR JOB RESOLVING TODAYS ACTIVITY...SO ANY TRENDS WILL 
NEED TO BE MONITORED OVERNIGHT/TOMORROW. OVERALL THOUGH...A SURFACE 
HIGH TO THE EAST OF THE REGION WILL ONCE AGAIN ATTEMPT TO PROMOTE 
WARMER AND DRY CONDITIONS...WITH MOST AREAS PROGGED TO REACH THE 
UPPER 70S TO THE MID 80S BY THE AFTERNOON. 


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...A STALLED FRONT WILL REMAIN
ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY KEEPING THE BRUNT OF THE SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL KEEP A LOW CHANCE
POPS FOR THE FAR NORTHERN AREAS...OTHERWISE DRY. FOR SATURDAY...A
SHORT-WAVE MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND UPPER OHIO
VALLEY WILL PROVIDE THE ENERGY TO PULL FRONT SOUTH ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA. UPPER JET MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PLACE
THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION WITH
DIRECT CIRCULATION FROM THE JET ENHANCING THE FRONTAL-GENETIC
FORCING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WOULD GO LIKELY POPS FOR THE AREA
SATURDAY...BUT STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE STRENGTH OF THE UPPER
JET AND PLACEMENT. WILL UP POPS TO HIGH CHANCE.

THE SHORT-WAVE WILL DIVE SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR 
SUNDAY. WILL MAINTAIN A CHANCE OF POPS...ESPECIALLY FOR THE WEST-
NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST WITH BOTH RIDGING 
SURFACE AND ALOFT TAKING HOLD.

.DISCUSSION...
BASED ON CURRENT OBS/TRENDS...HAVE INCREASED POPS A BIT ACROSS THE
FAR NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN ZONES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE BROAD AREA
OF SHOWERS AND STORMS THAT WILL BEGIN TO WORK THEIR WAY INTO SW
VIRGINA AND FAR NE TENNESSEE WITHIN THE NEXT HOUR. THIS ACTIVITY
IS BEING MAINTAINED BY SOME ENHANCED LIFT FROM A 850 MB JET DRAPED
ACROSS MIDDLE/SOUTHWEST TENNESSEE. AM STILL THINKING THAT THE
GENERAL TREND IN THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE A WEAKENING ONE AS IT PUSHES
EAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA GIVEN THE DRIER AND MORE STABLE
ATMOSPHERE HERE. HOWEVER...THE AFOREMENTIONED JET MAY HELP TO
MAINTAIN THIS ACTIVITY SOMEWHAT ALONG KY/TN BORDER AND SW
VIRGINIA THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING. ADDITIONALLY...SOME ISOLATED
SHOWERS ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE MAY WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE UPPER TENNESSEE VALLEY BEFORE
00Z AS WELL.

&&

.AVIATION...
VFR CONDITIONS WILL BE THE PREDOMINANT FLIGHT CATEGORY THROUGH THE
PERIOD. A DECAYING TSRA COMPLEX ACROSS KY WILL PROVIDE THE
POTENTIAL FOR A VCSH AT KTRI THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE
AFTERNOON...ALONG WITH SOME BKN/OVC LOWER CIGS. MID LEVEL CLOUDS
WILL LINGER ACROSS THE REGION ALL NIGHT AS THIS COMPLEX MOVES NORTH
OF THE REGION...WITH WINDS REMAINING FAIRLY LIGHT AND FROM THE
SOUTH.

.DISCUSSION...
A BEAUTIFUL AUTUMN MORNING HAS PREVAILED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION THIS MORNING AS A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE
REMAINS SITUATED JUST TO THE EAST OF THE AREA. THIS WILL PROMOTE A
GENERALLY WARM/DRY SOUTHERLY FLOW AND PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY
CONDITIONS. AS A RESULT...HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY RUN
ABOUT 5 T0 10 DEGREES WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...WITH MANY LOCATIONS
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REACHING THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S
LATER TODAY.

DESPITE THE MOSTLY FAIR WEATHER EXPECTED...THE MAIN CHALLENGE WITH
THE FORECAST TODAY WILL BE THE POSSIBLY OF A DECAYING MCS THAT IS
PRESENTLY SITUATED ACROSS CENTRAL KENTUCKY PUSHING TOWARD THE
ESE INTO THE FAR NORTHERN AND NORTHEASTERN ZONES LATER THIS
AFTERNOON. ATTM...THE BEST THETA-E ADVECTION AND INSTABILITY IS
DISPLACED WELL TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE REGION...AND GIVEN THAT
THIS CONVECTION WILL BE WORKING ITS WAY INTO A MUCH MORE STABLE AND
DRIER ENVIRONMENT...AM THINKING THAT THE THREAT FOR PRECIPITATION
WILL BE FAIRLY LOW EVEN IN THESE AREAS BY THE AFTERNOON. MODELS
HAVE NOT HANDLED THE POSITION OF THIS ACTIVITY WELL AS OF LATE
EITHER...AND HAVE SHOWED STRONG QPF SIGNALS ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE
THAT ARE CERTAINLY NOT OCCURRING. STILL...GIVEN THAT SOME ISENTROPIC
LIFT IS PROGGED TO INCREASE OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINA AND FAR
NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AFTER 18Z...FELT THAT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
RAIN SHOWERS/ISOLATED THUNDER WAS WARRANTED FOR THE AFTERNOON. ALSO
INCREASED CLOUD COVER ACROSS THAT SAME AREA GIVEN THE DENSE LOW/MID
CLOUDS ADVECTING IN...WHICH WILL LIKELY LIMIT HEATING TODAY AND
KEEP HIGHS IN THE LOWER 70S AND PERHAPS THE UPPER 60S IN A FEW
SPOTS.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A VERY DRY AIR MASS 
REMAINING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...CURRENT DEWPOINTS ARE A 
LITTLE HIGHER THAN THIS TIME YESTERDAY EVENING...SO THINK THAT MINS 
SHOULD BE A LITTLE WARMER OVERNIGHT (COMPARED TO THIS MORNING). 
TEMPS ARE CURRENTLY FALLING A LITTLE FASTER THAN FORECAST OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...SO WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST 
THIS EVENING TO LOWER MINS IN THESE AREAS. ALSO...THINK THAT THE 
HIGHER DEWPOINTS THIS EVENING WILL COMBINE WITH WARM LAKE TEMPS 
(RELATIVE TO THE COOL AIR TEMPS) TO ALLOW SOME PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP 
ALONG THE WATERWAYS. THUS...WILL MENTION SOME PATCHY FOG TOWARDS 
SUNRISE IN THE UPDATE FOR ALL ZONES.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY...PROMOTING SOME
TERRIFIC AUTUMN WEATHER FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA. 

THIS AFTERNOON...LIGHT BUT PERSISTENT NORTH TO NORTHEASTERLY FLOW
HAS HELPED TO REINFORCE A COOL/DRY POST FRONTAL AIRMASS AND HAS
KEPT HEATING IN CHECK SOMEWHAT...AS TEMPERATURES HAVE STRUGGLED TO
CLIMB ABOVE THE MID 60S TO LOW 70S AS OF 3 PM EDT. HOWEVER...AS THE
CENTER OF THIS RIDGE MOVES SLIGHTLY TO THE SOUTHEAST...WINDS WILL
GRADUALLY SHIFT TO THE SOUTH/SOUTHWEST TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY. THOUGH
CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT ONCE AGAIN...
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER THAN
LAST NIGHT. WHILE A FEW SHELTERED LOCATIONS MAY DROP INTO THE UPPER
30S TO AROUND 40...MOST LOCATIONS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE MID TO
UPPER 40S /WITH A FEW LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE
REMAINING ABOVE 50 DEGREES/. AS A RESULT...DO NOT FEEL THAT A FROST
ADVISORY WILL BE NECESSARY...PARTICULARLY SINCE IT WAS FAIRLY
MARGINAL LAST NIGHT WHEN CONDITIONS WERE COOLER AND BOUNDARY LAYER
MOISTURE WAS SLIGHTLY HIGHER.

FOR TUESDAY...THE NAM CONTINUES TO SHOW SOME LIGHT QPF SIGNALS
/ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY
OVERNIGHT/ MOVING INTO THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES AFTER 12Z. GIVEN THAT
THIS IS THE ONLY SOLUTION THAT IS SHOWING THIS...DID NOT FEEL
CONFIDENT IN GOING MORE THAN LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS ACROSS OUR
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA COUNTIES ATTM. THE MAIN STORY FOR THE NEXT
COUPLE OF DAYS HOWEVER WILL SIMPLY BE THE WARM...SUNNY AND DRY
CONDITIONS BEING PROMOTED BY THE AFOREMENTIONED HIGH PRESSURE
RIDGE. WITH HIGHER THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT...HIGHS WILL
RETURN TO THE UPPER 70S AND LOWER 80S FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...
WITH A FEW SPOTS ACROSS THE SOUTH POSSIBLY REACHING 85 BY MIDWEEK.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
EXTENDED STARTS OFF OKAY BUT QUICKLY GETS MURKY AS MODELS ARE QUITE 
APART ON LATE PERIOD SOLUTION. LATEST GFS HAS FAIR WX EARLY NEXT 
WEEK WHILE 00Z ECMWF HAS WET WX FOR THE SAME TIME FRAME. IT SEEMS 
THE LATEST CANADIAN RUN LEANS TOWARD THE ECMWF SIDE. NOT TO LEAVE 
THE AMERICAN SOLUTIONS ISOLATED...THE 06Z DGEX LIKEWISE FAVORS A 
WETTER SOLUTION. WE WILL HAVE LOW POPS IN THE FORECAST UNTIL THERE 
IS CLARITY ON TAKING THEM OUT OR BUMPING THEM HIGHER. THE MAIN 
WEATHER CULPRIT TO THE MODEL DISPARITIES IS A PERSISTENT LONGWAVE 
TROUGH OVER THE EAST...WITH A SLOW MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO BE 
DRAPED SOMEWHERE AROUND THE OH/TN VALLEYS. THE THREE WET MODELS PICK 
UP ON A SHORTWAVE ROUNDING THE BASE OF THE LONGWAVE THIS COMING 
WEEKEND AND TAPPING INTO MOISTURE TO PRODUCE PRECIP...WHILE GFS IS A 
BIT FASTER AND MUCH DRIER WITH THE SHORTWAVE FEATURE. WE SHALL SEE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
TO OUR NORTHWEST WILL DRIFT EAST AND SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE PERIOD.  
WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE WILL SEE MAINLY CLEAR CONDITIONS TONIGHT AND 
MONDAY.  WITH WINDS DROPPING OFF TONIGHT AND CLEAR SKY EXPECT SOME 
AREAS OF FROST TO FORM MAINLY NORTH AND EAST ZONES..WITH SOME PATCHY 
LIGHT FROST EVEN INTO SOME OUTLYING AREAS OF CENTRAL VALLEY AND 
NORTHERN PLATEAU.  WILL ISSUE FROST ADVISORY FOR NORTHEAST AND 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS ZONES FOR LATE TONIGHT.  



.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... CONTINUED PLEASANT
WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE FIRST FULL WEEK OF AUTUMN AS A
SURFACE HIGH WILL PROMOTE GENERALLY MOSTLY TO PARTLY SUNNY
CONDITIONS AND WARMER DAYTIME TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 70S TO MID
80S FOR MUCH OF THE WORK WEEK. MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS ARE
ANTICIPATED FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT SOME LOW-END
CHANCES FOR ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL EXIST ON TUESDAY AS THE NAM IS
HINTING AT THE REMNANTS OF SOME NOCTURNAL CONVECTION ACROSS
KENTUCKY MOVING INTO THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES DURING THE
MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON.

A COLD FRONT WILL GRADUALLY MOVE SOUTH FROM THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD 
THE FORECAST AREA LATE IN THE WEEK AS ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH MOVES 
ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. DEPENDING ON HOW FAR SOUTH 
THE FRONT MAKES IT...SOME LOW-END CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE 
POSSIBLE BEGINNING THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
ZONES. HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND...SOME SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRECIP 
CHANCES WILL EXIST AREAWIDE AS ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH IS PROGGED TO 
SWING FROM THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TOWARD THE REGION. STILL... 
GIVEN THE MODEL UNCERTAINTY ON THE EXACT TRACK/INTENSITY OF THIS 
LOW...DID NOT FEEL CONFIDENT GOING HIGHER THAN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
THAT FAR OUT IN THE FORECAST ATTM. THUS...WILL WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL 
CONTINUITY BEFORE MAKING ANY OTHER CHANGES TO THE POP FORECAST. IN 
ADDITION TO SOME SLIGHTLY BETTER RAIN CHANCES...ADDITIONAL CLOUD 
COVER/LOWERING THICKNESS VALUES WILL ALLOW FOR COOLER TEMPERATURES 
IN THE 70S TO AROUND 80 DEGREES BY THE DAYS 6 AND 7.

THROUGH THE PERIOD. SUNNY SKIES WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO WARM INTO THE 70S 
MOST AREAS. TONIGHT TEMPS WILL FALL TO WELL BELOW NORMAL. SOME 30S 
CAN BE EXPECTED IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND OUTLYING VALLEYS. 
DURATION OF COLDEST TEMPERATURES AND DRY AIRMASS DO NOT SEEM TO 
SUPPORT FROST FOR MOST AREAS...ALTHOUGH ISOLATED HIGHER VALLEYS IN 
THE NE COULD SEE SOME LIGHT FROST.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A COOL...DRY AIR MASS WILL 
REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS THE MRX CWA FOR MONDAY.  WARMING TREND BEGINS 
OVER THE REGION ON TUESDAY AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
EXTENDED.  THE MAIN WEATHER MAKER FOR THE EXTENDED WILL BE A COLD 
FRONT THAT IS EXPECTED TO STALL OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY.  A 
SERIES OF WEAK IMPULSES RIDING ALONG THIS BOUNDARY WILL OCCASIONALLY 
BRING IN BANDS OF CLOUDS AS WELL AS A STRAY SHOWER.  WILL CONTINUE 
WITH LOW POPS NORTH ON TUESDAY AS THE FIRST OF THE IMPULSES MOVES 
THROUGH.  ANOTHER...WEAKER WAVE TRACKS THROUGH TO OUR NORTH ON 
THURSDAY AND THEN AGAIN FRIDAY.  CONFIDENCE LOW BY THE END OF THE 
PERIOD BUT MAY SEE THE FRONT PUSH THROUGH ON SATURDAY FOR ISOLATED 
CONVECTION POSSIBLE ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWA.

239 PM EDT FRI SEP 21 2012

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND SATURDAY/...
A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY. MOISTURE WILL BE
QUITE LIMITED AS WILL FORCING. STILL LOOKS LIKE A SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS IS REASONABLE FOR SAT MORNING UNTIL MID AFTERNOON...AND WITH
THE LIMITED INSTABILITY WILL KEEP THUNDER MENTION OUT. WILL
GENERALLY GO SLIGHTLY ABOVE MAV NUMBERS FOR LOWS TONIGHT GIVEN SOME
CLOUDS MOVING IN AND WINDS STAYING UP AT LEAST SOME LOCATIONS. MAV
HIGHS LOOK REASONABLE FOR SAT.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
A COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK EAST OF THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. 
THOUGH A FEW ROGUE SHOWERS MAY BE POSSIBLE DURING THE EVENING... 
GIVEN THE LATEST MODEL TRENDS HAVE OPTED TO REMOVE MENTIONABLE POPS 
FROM THE ZONES AFTER 00Z SUNDAY...AS CONFIDENCE IS INCREASING FOR A 
DRY FORECAST AFTER SUNSET. THE MAIN WEATHER STORY WITH THIS STORM 
SYSTEM...WILL BE THE COOLER AND DRIER AIR PROGGED TO FILTER INTO THE 
REGION BEHIND THE FRONT...RESULTING IN HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S TO 
LOWER 70S AND LOWS IN THE 40S DURING THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK. A 
GRADUAL WARMING TREND WILL OCCUR AS A SURFACE RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD 
IN LATER NEXT WEEK...BUT A COUPLE OF SHORTWAVES ROTATING AROUND 
THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW SHOULD TEMPER HEATING SLIGHTLY...KEEPING 
HIGHS IN THE 70S TO LOW 80S THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. LATE 
IN THE PERIOD...ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO DROP OUT OF THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND APPROACH THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...WHICH 
COULD CERTAINLY BRING SOME CHANCES FOR SHOWERS TOWARD THE END OF 
NEXT WEEK. AS SUCH...GIVEN THAT BOTH MODELS ARE INDICATING FAIRLY 
GOOD QPF SIGNALS WITH THE FRONT SAGGING SOUTH ON FRIDAY...HAVE 
INTRODUCED A 20 POP TO THE GRIDS FOR NOW ON DAY 7.

.SHORT TERM...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL WITH JUST A FEW SCATTERED
CLOUDS DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON WHICH WILL GRADUALLY DISSIPATE
THIS EVENING. TONIGHT WILL BE MOSTLY CLEAR WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE
MID 50S. MOISTURE WILL BE ON THE RISE TOMORROW AS THE SURFACE RIDGE
BEGINS TO PUSH OFF TO THE EAST AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM BUT STILL
EXPECTING A DRY...MOSTLY SUNNY DAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES WARMING A
BIT INTO THE LOW TO MID 80S.

.LONG TERM...
.LONG TERM /FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
AFTER A FAIRLY WARM AND PLEASANT FRIDAY...AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM PASSING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES WILL PUSH A COLD 
FRONT INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY. ALONG WITH SOME INCREASED CLOUD 
COVER...THE FRONT WILL SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED SHOWERS /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES AND 
ALONG THE SPINE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS/ DURING THE AFTERNOON BEFORE 
TAPERING OFF AFTER SUNSET. THE MAIN STORY WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE 
HOWEVER WILL BE THE COOL/DRY AIR MASS THAT WILL FILTER INTO THE 
REGION BEHIND IT. THIS WILL PUSH DAYTIME HIGHS INTO THE BACK INTO 
THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WITH LOWS BOTTOMING 
OUT IN THE 40S TO AROUND 50 DEGREES IN MOST SPOTS OVERNIGHT. 

BEAUTIFUL AUTUMN WEATHER WITH AMPLE SUNSHINE WILL PREVAIL DURING THE 
EARLY TO MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK AS A SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. TEMPERATURES LOOK TO GRADUALLY WARM WELL INTO THE 
70S TO LOWER 80S BY TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY. ALTHOUGH DRY WEATHER IS 
EXPECTED...A SHORTWAVE PASSING THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY/CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS COULD TRIGGER A FEW ROGUE SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTHEAST 
ZONES ON TUESDAY...BUT DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO FORECAST  
MENTIONABLE POPS ATTM. LATE IN THE PERIOD...A STRONGER FRONT LOOKS 
TO DROP INTO THE AREA...WHICH MAY RESULT IN SOME SLIGHTLY BETTER 
PROSPECTS FOR PRECIPITATION. GIVEN BOTH MODELS INDICATING FAIRLY

CLOUDS SHOULD HANG AROUND MAINLY OVER THE CAROLINAS AND OVER THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ON THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. OTHERWISE...SKIES

WARMER WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S OVER MOST OF THE

TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL FOR LATE SEPTEMBER.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A CLOSED LOW WILL BE SLOWLY 
MOVING FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION TO QUEBEC THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...WITH THE MAIN IMPACT TO OUR AREA BEING A FRONTAL PASSAGE 
ON SATURDAY NIGHT. A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ORIENTED E-W ALONG THE GULF 
COAST WILL MEAN LIMITED MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE FRONT...AND THE UPPER 
JET STAYS WELL TO OUR NORTH...SO LIFT WILL BE WEAK. MODELS ARE 
COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH TIMING...WITH FROPA OCCURRING 
AROUND 00Z SUNDAY. WILL HAVE SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POPS SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT. 

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WITH ORIGINS IN CENTRAL CANADA WILL BUILD OVER 
THE AREA...BRINGING COOLER TEMPS FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. HIGHS WILL 
BE IN THE 70S WITH LOWS IN THE 40S. THE AIR MASS MODERATES TOWARD 
MORE SEASONAL NORMS AS THE RIDGE SHIFTS TO OUR EAST ON TUESDAY. THE 
GFS SHOWS A MID/UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSING THE AREA 
TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT LACK OF MOISTURE AND LIFT SHOULD MEAN JUST A 
SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER WITH NO POPS.

A FEW DEGREES MORE. A CLOSED LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND
SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY WILL INCREASE CLOUDS
ESPECIALLY OVER THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. LOWS SHOULD BE
SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER. NAM MODEL MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH SHOWERS
SATURDAY AND MORE UNSTABLE AHEAD OF COLD FRONT WITH ENOUGH
INSTABILITY THAT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS COULD FORM IN THE EASTERN
SECTIONS. GFS MODEL NOT AS UNSTABLE AS NAM AND QUICKER WITH SYSTEM
THAN ECMWF WHICH IS SLOWER WITH FRONT AND KEEPS SHOWERS AROUND
UNTIL SUNDAY MORNING. WILL KEEP PRECIPITATION AS SHOWERS FOR NOW
BUT HAVE A FEW SHOWERS INTO SUNDAY MORNING IN THE NE. CLOUDS
DECREASE SUNDAY BEHIND FRONT AS UPPER TROUGH MOVES IN. TEMPERATURES
MUCH COOLER SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH HIGHS ONLY IN THE 60S NORTH AND
LOWS DROPPING DOWN INTO THE 40S. WARMING TREND TUESDAY INTO
WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS BACK UP INTO THE 70S AND LOWS SLOWLY
MODERATING.

HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE AREA WILL KEEP CONDITIONS VFR AT
ALL SITES FOR A MAJORITY OF THE PERIOD. AN INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE EARLY TOMORROW MORNING COULD CAUSE SOME LOWER CIGS TO DEVELOP AT
EACH SITE...BUT HAVE KEPT VFR CIGS AT CHA AND TYS...AND MVFR AT
TRI. THIS MOISTURE COULD ALSO AID THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME PATCHY
LIGHT FOG AT TYS AND POSSIBLE MVFR TO IFR VSBYS AT TRI. THE AMOUNT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STILL A FEW CLOUDS BANKED UP 
AGAINST THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS PART OF SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND IN THE VICINITY OF THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS. ALSO FOG IS DEVELOPING WHERE WINDS ARE CALM ACROSS 
NORTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. EXPECT THE FOG AND STRATUS TO 
DISSIPATE FAIRLY QUICKLY THIS MORNING WITH A SUNNY DAY IN STORE. MAX 
TEMPS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL TODAY DESPITE THE SUN 
FILLED SKIES. MODELS SHOW SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURNING ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND THE MOUNTAINS ON 
THE TENNESSEE BORDER. KEPT THIS CLOUD COVER PARTLY CLOUDY FOR NOW 
ALTHOUGH SOME MODELS ARE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH DEVELOPING A BKN-OVC 
LAYER IN THIS AREA. SHOULD BE COOL FALL LIKE NIGHT WITH LOW TEMPS A 
FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL AND CHILLING OF THE SURFACE AIRMASS ACROSS 
THE VALLEYS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE SHOULD 
YIELD AT LEAST PATCHY FOG DUE TO THE RECENT LENGTHY PERIOD OF RAIN.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...DRY WEATHER WITH A 
GRADUAL WARMING TREND CAN BE EXPECTED THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK 
WEEK AS THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS TO OUR EAST. HIGH WILL REACH 
INTO THE 80S AGAIN IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS BY FRIDAY. A CLOSED LOW 
WILL BE SPINNING OVER THE UPPER GREAT LAKES/ONTARIO...WITH AN 
EMBEDDED SHORTWAVE TROUGH DIPPING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY ON SATURDAY. 
THE NAM APPEARS TO BE AN OUTLIER AMONG THE MODELS...BRINGING THE 
COLD FRONT THROUGH MUCH FASTER. WILL LEAN MORE TOWARD THE 
GFS/SREF/ECMWF WHICH SHOW FROPA SATURDAY NIGHT...AND CARRY POPS 
SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. ALL MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE WILL BE 
VERY LIMITED WITH THIS SYSTEM...SO WILL HAVE POPS IN THE SLIGHT TO 
LOW CHANCE RANGE...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS NORTH. A COLD AND DRY AIR 
MASS FOLLOWS FOR SUNDAY...AND TEMPS SHOULD BE BELOW NORMAL FOR THE 
BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK.

LITTLE IN THE WAY OF WEATHER PROBLEMS FOR FLIGHT OPERATIONS.
HOWEVER EARLY THIS MORNING SOME LINGERING MVFR CEILINGS REMAIN OR
ARE EXPANDING TO SOME DEGREE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS
SHOULD IMPACT TRI BUT MAY ALSO DEVELOP ACROSS TYS FOR A PERIOD
EARLY THIS MORNING. THOUGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT WOULD BE TIGHT ENOUGH
TO KEEP THE SURFACE FROM DE-COUPLING BUT WIND HAS LIGHTENED UP AT
TYS AND THEREFORE APPLIED SOME MVFR FOG HERE. TRI WILL BE A LITTLE
TRICKY IF CEILINGS DON'T HANG AROUND THROUGH DAYBREAK. VSBY COULD
DROP TO IFR HERE IF THAT HAPPENS. FOR NOW FORECAST MVFR VSBY WITH
THE SAME CATEGORY CEILING IN PLACE. THERE COULD BE SOME MORE FOG

410 AM EDT TUE SEP 18 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...STRONG LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE 
IS CURRENTLY PRODUCING A BAND OF HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE TN VALLEY. 
THE NAM SEEMS TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE SITUATION...CORRECTLY 
PLACING THE AREA OF HIGHEST QPF. THE CONVERGENCE ZONE TRACKS EAST 
THROUGH THE MORNING...MOVING TO OUR EASTERN BORDER AROUND 16Z. 
EXPECT THAT MOST OF THE HEAVY RAIN WILL BE OUT OF OUR AREA AROUND OR 
SHORTLY AFTER THIS TIME. WITH MODERATE RAINFALL SEEN ON RADAR BEHIND 
THIS MAIN HEAVY BAND...WILL KEEP THE FLOOD WATCH INTACT. HOWEVER IT 
IS EXPECTED THAT WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE WATCH COULD BE REMOVED 
BEFORE ITS EXPIRATION TIME OF 00Z. 

ADVECTION OF DRIER AIR BEHIND THE 700 MB TROUGH AXIS BEGINS IN 
EARNEST LATE THIS AFTERNOON. RAIN CHANCES SHOULD BEGIN TO TAPER OFF 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...AND ENDING EVERYWHERE AROUND MIDNIGHT. COLD 
ADVECTION KICKS IN TONIGHT...AND WITH CLEARING SKIES...LOWS ARE 
EXPECTED TO FALL INTO THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S IN MOST SPOTS. 
WEDNESDAY LOOKS LIKE A VERY PLEASANT EARLY FALL DAY...WITH MOSTLY 
SUNNY SKIES AND HIGHS IN THE UPPER 60S TO MID 70S.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THE PERIOD STARTS OUT 
DRY AS MODELS INDICATE A WEAK SHORT WAVE SHIFTS EAST ACROSS THE DEEP 
SOUTH WITH NO IMPACT ON THE FORECAST AREA OTHER THAN A BIT OF CIRRUS 
AND POSSIBLY SOME ALTO CU ON THURSDAY. ANOTHER DRY DAY IS LIKELY ON 
FRIDAY AS THE FORECAST AREA AWAITS AMPLIFYING NORTH CENTRAL U.S. 
LONG WAVE TROUGH AND ITS VARIOUS SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES. THE 
GFS AND DEEPER CANADIAN MODEL STAY THE COURSE AND ALLOW AN INITIAL 
WAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT TO SWEEP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SATURDAY. PREFERRED THIS CONCEPT TO THE SLOWER ECMWF WHICH BRINGS 
THE BOUNDARY THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. DEPICTION STILL 
INDICATES LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN AND LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE WITH THE FROPA SO STAYED WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR MOST 
OF THE AREA ON SATURDAY. A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF ENERGY TRAILS THROUGH 
THE BACK SIDE OF THE EASTWARD MIGRATING LONG WAVE ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY THROUGH MID SOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AND THEREFORE 
MAINTAINED SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR A PERIOD OF POST FRONTAL 
SHOWERS. DRIER AIR SPILLS INTO THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY 
AS THE DEEP UPPER TROUGH FINALLY LIFTS OUT ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN 
U.S. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE MIN TEMPS THROUGH THE 
PERIOD WHILE ADJUSTING SUGGESTED MAXES...WHICH APPEAR TO BE A LITTLE 
TOO OPTIMISTIC...BACK A DEGREE OR TWO WITH THE LENGTHY PERIOD OF

POSSIBILITY OF SLIGHT IMPROVEMENT TO MAINLY MVFR DURING THE DAY AS
A SURFACE COLD FRONT SLIDES SLOWLY EAST TOWARD THE NORTH CAROLINA
BORDER. WOULD EXPECT VFR FLIGHT TO DEVELOP AROUND 18-00Z TUE/WED AS
DOWNWARD MOTION AND DRIER AIR BUILD ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY.

.DISCUSSION...
AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO TRACK THROUGH THE 
LOWER-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY THIS EVENING...BRINGING WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS/ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL TO THE 
AREA OVERNIGHT AND THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW. WITH A STRONG 50-60 KT 
LOW-LEVEL JET RAMPING UP OVERNIGHT...ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE IN PLACE 
/WITH PWATS AOA 2 INCHES/...AND A DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER...THE 
POTENTIAL FOR HIGH RAINFALL RATES WILL EXIST WITH THIS ACTIVITY... 
RESULTING IN A LOCALIZED FLOODING THREAT BEGINNING LATE TONIGHT AND 
PERSISTING THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW. THE BEST CHANCE FOR FLOODING 
WILL BE IN URBANIZED AREAS WHERE RUNOFF ISSUES WILL EXIST. ALSO... 
POOR DRAINAGE AREAS AND LOCATIONS NEAR CREEKS AND STREAMS BE A 
CONCERN ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WHERE 
HEAVY RAINFALL HAS ALREADY OCCURRED...AND WHERE SOME MESOSCALE 
BANDING HAS BEGUN TO SET UP AS THE LOW-LEVEL JET CRANKS UP AND MOVES 
PARALLEL TO A COLD FRONT SLOWLY LIFTING NORTHEASTWARD OVERNIGHT. 
BOTH THE NAM AND GFS HAVE DONE FAIRLY WELL IN RESOLVING THIS AND 
SHOW THE HEAVIEST ACTIVITY LIFTING NORTHWARD WITH THE FRONT 
OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE FAR WESTERN ZONES. LOCALIZED STORM RAINFALL 
TOTALS OF UP TO 4-5 INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THIS AREA...WITH 
GENERALLY 2-3 INCHES BEING POSSIBLE FOR MANY OTHER LOCATIONS ACROSS 
THE REGION BY TOMORROW EVENING. GIVEN ALL THIS...HAVE EXPANDED THE 
FLOOD WATCH ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY. 

THE OTHER FORECAST CONCERN THROUGH LATE TONIGHT WILL BE A LOW-END 
TORNADO THREAT THAT EXISTS PRIMARILY ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE 
INTERSTATE 40 CORRIDOR. A SOMEWHAT DIFFUSE WARM FRONT IS GRADUALLY 
PROGGED TO LIFT NORTHWARD OVERNIGHT. THOUGH INSTABILITY PARAMETERS 
WILL BE EXTREMELY MARGINAL...THE STRENGTHENING LOW-LEVEL JET WILL 
ENHANCE 0-1 KM SHEAR AND HELICITY VALUES. THIS...COMBINED WITH SOME 
SLIGHTLY BACKED WINDS AHEAD OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT...AND THE 
BOUNDARY ITSELF COULD RESULT IN AN ISOLATED STRONGER STORM OR TWO 
DEVELOPING...WHICH WOULD BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A BRIEF/WEAK 
TORNADO. THUS...A TORNADO WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR MOST OF THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 07Z. IN GENERAL THOUGH... 
AM EXPECTING THE OVERALL THREAT TO BE FAIRLY LOW GIVEN SOME OF THE 
OTHER MISSING PARAMETERS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...RAIN SHOWERS WITH SOME EMBEDDED 
THUNDER WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE MRX CWA THROUGH THE REST OF 
THE DAY.  AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL ENHANCE THIS CONVECTIVE 
ACTIVITY OVERNIGHT...GENERATING A LARGE BAND OF CONVECTION AND 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF RAIN.  A FLOOD WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR 
PORTIONS OF THE AREA.  CONDITIONS WILL BE SLOW TO IMPROVE ON TUESDAY 
AS RAIN SLOWLY MOVES OUT FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AT THE START OF THIS 
PERIOD...THE RAINS FROM THIS PRESENT SYSTEM ARE IN THE PROCESS OF 
MOVING OUT OF THE AREA...BUT THE BACK END OF PRECIP MAY WELL BE 
LAGGING INTO THIS FIRST PERIOD.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD BE 
BUILDING INTO THE REGION FROM THE NORTHWEST...IN THE WAKE OF THE 
COLD FRONT PASSAGE.  FOR THE REST OF THE WORK WEEK...IT LOOKS DRY 
AND SEASONABLY COOLER...WITH A LITTLE WARMING TOWARD THE END OF THE 
WEEK IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT SYSTEM.  

THE NEXT SYSTEM OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE COMES THIS WEEKEND.  MUCH OF THE 
ENERGY FOR THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO BE FOCUSED FARTHER NORTH INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND/OR GREAT LAKES.  HOWEVER, THERE IS AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
MODELS FOR A WAVE OF UPPER LEVEL LIFT TO SWEEP THROUGH THE AREA FROM 
THE NORTHWEST.  THE TIMING RIGHT NOW FOR THIS EVENT IS CENTERED ON 
SATURDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS BOUT OF PRECIP SHOULD BE MUCH LESS 
SIGNIFICANT THAN THE ONE TRUDGING THROUGH THE AREA NOW.  
TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLING AGAIN EARLY NEXT WEEK BEHIND THE 
WEEKEND COLD FRONT.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A SIGNIFICANT PRECIP EVENT WILL BE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE REGION
THROUGH TODAY...WITH EXCESSIVE RAINFALL POSSIBLE THROUGH TONIGHT. A
SOUTHERN STREAM CLOSED LOW NOW OVER TX WILL BE TRACKING NW AND
MERGING WITH A DEEPENING TROUGH NOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS.
STRONG Q-G FORCING WILL PRODUCE CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE TN
VALLEY...WITH THE SURFACE LOW TRACKING DIRECTLY OVER EAST TN FROM
03Z TO 12Z TONIGHT. MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL BE RAMPING UP THROUGH
THE DAY AS THE SOUTHERLY 850 MB JET STRENGTHENS UP TO 30-40 KTS BY
MIDNIGHT. A STRENGTHENING 300 MB JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL
PLACE MIDDLE AND EAST TN IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION WITH GOOD
UPPER DIVERGENCE. FRONTOGENETIC FORCING IS MAXIMIZED AFTER 00Z OVER
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND THIS IS THE AREA THAT WILL LIKELY SEE
THE GREATEST AMOUNTS. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW NARROW BUT DEEP CAPE
THROUGH TODAY AND TONIGHT...FAVORABLE FOR HEAVY RAIN WITH ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS.

RAINFALL AMOUNTS THROUGH 12Z TUE WILL LIKELY AVERAGE BETWEEN 1 AND 3 
INCHES AREA-WIDE...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALLY 3 TO 5 
INCHES...ESPECIALLY IN THE WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA. A FLOOD WATCH 
WILL BE ISSUED FROM NOON TODAY THROUGH NOON TUESDAY FOR AREAS WEST 
OF A LINE FROM WISE COUNTY VA TO THE TN/NC BORDER OF CHEROKEE AND 
POLK. FORTUNATELY...WE ARE COMING INTO THIS EVENT WITH DRY SOIL 
CONDITIONS AND LOW RIVER LEVELS...WHICH SHOULD MITIGATE THE FLOOD 
THREAT SOMEWHAT.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE 
REGION ON TUESDAY PROVIDING ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER ON 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. ANOTHER FRONT ENTERS THE AREA ON LATE FRIDAY 
AND INTO SATURDAY PROVIDING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. DRY WEATHER 
RETURNS ON SUNDAY. COOLER TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY AND

.DISCUSSION...
VERY MINOR CHANGES TO THE FORECAST MADE THIS EVENING AS MOST
EVERYTHING LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK. AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM
CURRENTLY SITUATED OVER CENTRAL TEXAS WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK TOWARD
THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT. AHEAD OF THIS STORM
SYSTEM...GULF MOISTURE WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE REGION...RESULTING
IN MID/HIGH DECKS OF CLOUDS SPREADING IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST...ALONG
WITH SOME CHANCES FOR SHOWERS /PARTICULARLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE/. IN GENERAL...THINK THAT COVERAGE WILL BE FAIRLY MINIMAL
AND ISOLATED IN NATURE FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT. HOWEVER...AS LIFT
INCREASES WITH THE APPROACHING STORM SYSTEM LATE TONIGHT...SHOWERS
WILL BEGIN TO BECOME MORE NUMEROUS BY DAYBREAK. THUS...HAVE
ORIENTED THE POP GRIDS WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES FAVORING THE
SOUTHERN ZONES AFTER 06Z. MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE ALSO HINTING AT THE
POTENTIAL FOR SOME LIGHT FOG FORMATION LATE TONIGHT GIVEN THE
INCREASED MOISTURE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER. HOWEVER...CLOUD COVER
SHOULD LIMIT THIS POTENTIAL TO AREA LAKES...SO HAVE KEPT A MENTION
OF PATCHY FOG IN THESE LOCATIONS ONLY.

EXPECTED OVERNIGHT AS THE FORECAST AREA AWAITS FOR THE NEXT UPPER 
TROUGH MOVES CLOSER TO HELP INCREASE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. THAT OCCURS 
IN ERNEST DURING THE DAY MONDAY AS LOW LEVEL WINDS SHIFT TO THE 
SOUTH AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST. THE MAJORITY OF 
RAINFALL WILL OCCUR CLOSER TO NOON AND BEYOND ON MONDAY. WE SHOULD 
SEE SHOWERS BEGIN OVER SOUTHERN AREAS AND SPREAD NORTHWARD. THIS

OKLAHOMA CITY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A MOIST SHORT WAVE 
RIDING ALONG STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY COMBINED WITH ADDED LIFT FROM

925 AM EDT SUN SEP 16 2012

.DISCUSSION...QUICK UPDATE TO TWEAK MAX TEMPS DOWN SLIGHTLY FOR
MOST AREAS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AREAS BORDERING AL/GA. THE
SOUTHERN AREAS WILL HAVE THE BEST POTENTIAL TO REACH THE LOWER 80S.
THE WEAK SHORTWAVE TRANSLATING ACROSS SOUTHERN KY IS PRODUCING
LIGHT SHOWERS OVER EASTERN KY AND NORTHERN SECTION OF MIDDLE TN.
LITTLE TO NO MEASURABLE RAIN WILL OCCUR OVER SW VA AND NE TN THIS
MORNING. WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL HELP KEEP THE TEMPS SLIGHTLY COOLER
OVER THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. CONTINUED
CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN THROUGH TODAY. OTHER PARAMETERS LOOKED
GOOD.

340 AM EDT SUN SEP 16 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA TODAY AS A LOW TO 
MIDLEVEL RIDGE SHIFTS OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST AND A SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
OVER TX SLOWLY MOVES EAST. A JET STREAK WILL BE ACROSS KY AND VA 
TODAY...WITH A 500 MB VORT MAX CROSSING THE AREA TONIGHT. HOWEVER 
THE LOW LEVEL FLOW REMAINS VERY WEAK...SO WHAT LITTLE LIFT WE WILL 
HAVE WILL BE IN THE MID-UPPER LEVELS. BEST CHANCES WILL BE IN 
SOUTHERN AREAS THIS AFTERNOON WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE A BIT MORE 
FAVORABLE...BUT STILL JUST IN THE LOW CHANCE RANGE. RAIN CHANCES 
CONTINUE TO INCREASE TONIGHT WITH THE 500 MB VORT MAX AND A 
STRENGTHENING 850 MB FLOW. WILL SPREAD CHANCE POPS FARTHER NORTHWARD 
AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH LIKELY POPS LATE TONIGHT IN SOUTHERN ZONES. 
LACK OF INSTABILITY AND WEAK LIFT SUGGEST ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A FRONTAL BOUNDARY LINGERS 
OVER THE AREA ON MONDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCE POPS GOING ON MONDAY.
THE HIGHEST CHANCES ARE EXPECTED ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT WHEN A
WAVE TRACKS ALONG THE BOUNDARY BRINGING A BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS. ANOTHER FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION ON
TUESDAY PROVIDING ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HIGH
PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.
ANOTHER FRONT ENTERS THE AREA ON LATE FRIDAY AND INTO SATURDAY
PROVIDING ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS. EXCEPT FOR COOLER TEMPERATURES
ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONAL
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR
MEX AND HPC FOR TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...
THE PRIMARY CHANGE MADE TO THE FORECAST WAS TO REMOVE MENTIONABLE
POPS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS. THE NAM IN PARTICULAR HAS SHOWED QPF
SIGNALS ALONG THIS AREA ALL EVENING...BUT THEY HAVE SIMPLY NOT
MATERIALIZED. ADDITIONALLY...MOST OF THE SHOWER ACTIVITY TO THE
EAST OF THE TN/NC STATE LINE HAS DIMINISHED WITH THE LOSS OF SOLAR
HEATING. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PROGRESSING THROUGH MIDDLE TENNESSEE
WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH TOWARD THE REGION...INCREASING MID/HIGH CLOUD
COVER ACROSS THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. THIS CLOUD COVER MAY LIMIT
THE FOG POTENTIAL IN MOST AREA LOCATIONS OVERNIGHT...BUT MODEL
SOUNDINGS DO INDICATE THE POSSIBLY OF THIS IN LOCALIZED SHELTERED
AREAS NEAR BODIES OF WATER...SO HAVE MAINTAINED A MENTION OF THIS
IN THE ZONES LATE TONIGHT. WITH A LITTLE MORE CLOUD COVER...
TEMPERATURES MAY BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER...GENERALLY IN THE
UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
319 PM EDT SAT SEP 15 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...MAIN CONCERN IS THE
PHASING OF THE SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE OVER TEXAS WITH A LONG-
WAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS/GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY
AND TUESDAY. MODELS SHOW THE SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE HELPING TO PULL
INCREASING GULF-MOISTURE INTO A STALLED FRONT OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. STRONG UPPER JET ASSOCIATED WITH NORTHERN STREAM
TROUGH WILL PLACE THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHAINS UNDER
THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET AND AGEOSTROPHIC JET
DIRECT CIRCULATION. THE CIRCULATION WILL INTENSIFY THE
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING OVER THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING. 

ANOTHER INTERESTING FEATURE IS THE IMPRESSIVE TROPOPAUSE FOLD THAT
DEVELOPS WITH THE NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH OVER THE OHIO VALLEY
WHICH AIDS IN THE STRONG CYCLOGENESIS LOW THAT DEVELOPS OVER THE
EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY THEN RACES NORTHEAST ALONG THE
APPALACHIANS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.

MODELS SHOW A GOOD DEAL OF RAINFALL WITH BETWEEN 2 AND POSSIBLY 4
INCHES ANTICIPATED. HAVE INCLUDED THE POTENTIAL OF LOCALIZED
FLOODING CONCERNS.

IN THE SHORT-TERM...INCREASING MOISTURE/INSTABILITY AND A SERIES OF WAVES
EXITING SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE WILL PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS
AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORMS FOR SUNDAY. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A STRONG COLD FRONT PUSHING 
THROUGH THE REGION WILL CONTINUE TO BRING IN WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE MRX CWA ON TUESDAY.  THE SYSTEM WILL EXIT 
THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT WITH PRECIP ENDING FROM WEST TO EAST.  HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR WEDNESDAY AND CONTINUE TO DOMINATE AREA 
WEATHER THROUGH THURSDAY WITH CLEAR SKIES AND COOLER TEMPERATURES..  
AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL ALLOW A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS TO 
DEVELOP OVER THE AREA FRIDAY WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED ON 
SATURDAY WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.

MORNING...BUT WE SHOULD SEE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES LATER THIS MORNING
AS IT SLOWLY MOVES EAST. HIGH TEMPS MAY BE A BIT WARMER THAN
YESTERDAY WITH LESS CLOUD COVER EXPECTED. WITH THE JET STREAM WELL
TO THE NORTH AND NEARLY ZONAL NW FLOW IN THE MID AND UPPER
LEVELS...LIFT WITH THE FRONT WILL BE DECREASING AS IT APPROACHES.
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT ARE LACKING AS
WELL...SO WILL HAVE NO POPS TODAY...AND JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE POP
NORTH TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WEAK FRONT TRACKING
INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY. WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE AND LIFT
EXPECTING ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS ON SATURDAY. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
LINGERS INTO SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCE POPS
GOING INTO SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR MONDAY
WHEN A WAVES TRACKS ACROSS THE BOUNDARY BRINGING BETTER CHANCES OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. ANOTHER FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION
ON TUESDAY PROVIDING ANOTHER CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER ON WEDNESDAY AND
THURSDAY. NEAR SEASONAL TEMPERATURES FOR MOST OF THE PERIOD. STAYED
NEAR MEX AND HPC FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...
DECKS OF MID TO HIGH CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO STREAM ACROSS THE
REGION EARLY THIS MORNING AND INTO THE DAY...THANKS TO A PLUME OF
MOISTURE ALOFT PUSHING NORTHWARD IN RESPONSE TO AN UPPER-LEVEL
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. TO THE EAST
OF THE REGION...AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SITUATED
ALONG THE SPINE OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS WILL REMAIN THE OVERALL
DOMINANT FEATURE CONTROLLING THE WEATHER TODAY...WHICH WILL PROMOTE
PARTLY SUNNY AND DRY CONDITIONS. HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE FAIRLY
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...WITH MOST LOCATIONS IN THE VALLEYS REACHING
THE 80-85 DEGREE RANGE. MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE CONTINUING TO SHOW THE
POTENTIAL FOR MID-LEVEL CLOUDS DEVELOPING/PERSISTING INTO THE
OVERNIGHT HOURS. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT FOG DEVELOPMENT
OVERNIGHT. GIVEN THIS /COMBINED WITH THE LACK OF FOG FORMATION THIS
MORNING/...HAVE OPTED TO REMOVE A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG FROM THE
GRIDS AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM...
ALL MODELS SEEM IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON A SERIOUS LACK OF MOISTURE
AND LIFT WITH THE WEAK FRONT...WHICH SHOULD BE EAST OF THE FORECAST
AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT. I DID ADD A VERY SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER
ACROSS SW VA FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT MAIN CHANGE WAS TO DROP POPS
FOR ALL BUT EASTERN MTNS ON SATURDAY.

GIVEN THE DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY FOR THE REST OF WEEKEND...I WAS 
HESITANT TO MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES. THERE IS A WEAK AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE NOTED OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY REGION THIS MORNING...
BUT THIS SHOULD GET KICKED NE AHEAD OF THE GREAT LAKES TROUGH AND 
WEAK COLD FRONT. THE SREF AND CANADIAN MODELS ARE THEN MAINLY DRY 
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...WHILE GFS MODEL DEVELOPS A 
TROUGH OVER THE SRN PLAINS AND MOVES IT EASTWARD SPREADING AT LEAST 
SCATTERED CONVECTION INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY 
NIGHT. ECMWF IS NOT NEARLY AS AGGRESSIVE WITH CONVECTION FOR SUNDAY. 
THUS...LITTLE CHANGES FOR NOW. 

TIMING OF THE DEEPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH...PER A MODEL CONSENSUS... 
SEEMS TO BE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY...WHICH SHOULD BE THE WETTER PERIODS 
COMPLETE WITH BOTH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE PREVIOUS GRIDS 
GENERALLY HAVE HIGHER CHANCE POPS FOR THOSE PERIODS...ALTHO GFSX MOS 
POPS ARE HOLDING CONSISTENTLY AROUND LIKELY POPS. NO SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES JUST YET FOR NOW. 13/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE FAIRLY 
CONSISTENT WITH 12/12Z NUMBERS AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED.

AN UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE

SLIGHT POPS FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING FOR THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. 
WILL KEEP THUNDER OUT OF THE FORECAST GIVEN THE LIMITED INSTABILITY.

MOSTLY CLEAR SKY AND CALM WINDS TONIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT WILL 
ALLOW AREAS OF FOG TO DEVELOP OVER/NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS. SOME 
OF THE FOG COULD BECOME LOCALLY DENSE.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...FOLLOWED GFS MOS CLOSELY.


.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS SHOW A WEAKENING 
RATHER MOISTURE STARVED COLD FRONT BUILDING INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
EARLY IN THE DAY SATURDAY. KEPT THE STILL HARMLESS SLIGHT CHANCE 
PROBABILITY FOR A SHOWER GOING ON SATURDAY DUE TO THE FACT THAT THIS 
PERIOD IS STILL ABOUT THREE DAYS AWAY AND THERE WILL BE A BOUNDARY 
MOVING ACROSS THE REGION. IF THE DWINDLING PRECIP TREND WITH THIS 
FEATURE CONTINUES PROBABILITY OF PRECIP CAN BE REMOVED IN THE NEXT 
PACKAGE. AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN CONTINUES INTO THE EARLY PART 
OF NEXT WEEK. MODELS DIFFER ON HOW FAR SOUTH THIS FRONTAL PROGRESSES 
AND IT MAY HANG AROUND JUST SOUTH OF THE STATE AS ANOTHER WEAK SHORT 
WAVE BUILDS EAST THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY PERHAPS ALLOWING FOR 
A SLIGHT CHANCE OR A SHOWER SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS WAVE AMPLIFIES WITH 
SLOW MOVEMENT INTO THE EASTERN STATES SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WHILE AN 
EVEN STRONGER UPPER LEVEL DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE WESTERN

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
THE PLEASANT AUTUMN-LIKE CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION
FOR THE NEXT 24 HOURS AS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE BECOMES CENTERED
ACROSS THE SPINE OF THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. THOUGH DRY WEATHER IS
EXPECTED TO PERSIST FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS...SOME MID-LEVEL MOISTURE
HAS TRIGGERED SOME CLOUD COVER TONIGHT THAT SHOULD PROHIBIT FOG
DEVELOPMENT ACROSS MOST OF THE SHELTERED VALLEY LOCATIONS.
HOWEVER...THERE MAY BE SOME FOG DEVELOPMENT IN A FEW AREAS AROUND
DAYBREAK /PRIMARILY NEAR BODIES OF WATER WHERE GREATER BOUNDARY
LAYER MOISTURE WILL BE PRESENT/.

GIVEN THE ASSOCIATED HIGHER THICKNESS VALUES...WARMER TEMPERATURES
ALOFT AND THE AMPLE SUNSHINE EXPECTED...HIGHS TODAY SHOULD BE A FEW
DEGREES WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS SHOULD REACH
THE 80 DEGREE PLATEAU...WITH PERHAPS A FEW SPOTS ACROSS SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE CLIMBING INTO THE MID 80S. OVERNIGHT...SOME LOCALIZED
FOG FORMATION MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THE USUAL FOG-PRONE SHELTERED
AREAS /PARTICULARLY SINCE CLEARER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED/.
HOWEVER...DO NOT EXPECT IT TO BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO WARRANT A
MENTION IN THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME.

.LONG TERM /TOMORROW THROUGH TUESDAY/...
THE UPPER RIDGE HOLDS THROUGH LATE THURSDAY...THEN WEAKENS AS A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY
REGION. AN ASSOCIATED WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS SE INTO THE REGION
BY EARLY SATURDAY... BUT DYNAMICS ARE TO OUR NORTH AND MOISTURE IS
QUITE LIMITED... WHILE BEST MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IS OVER THE
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION. THIS SHOULD LEAVE US WITH 20
PERCENT POPS BEING SUFFICIENT FOR NOW OVER THE WEEKEND...AS I
PREFER THE DRIER LOOK OF THE ECMWF AND CANADIAN MODELS OVER THE
WETTER GFS. MOST HIGH SCHOOL FOOTBALL GAMES SHOULD BE DRY FRIDAY
NIGHT...AND UT GAME ON SATURDAY MAY ALSO DODGE ANY RAIN AS WELL.

HOWEVER...ENSEMBLES AND GFS/ECMWF ARE ADVERTISING A MUCH DEEPER 
TROUGH APPROACHING BY LATE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. 12/00Z GFS MOS POPS 
ARE TRENDING UPWARD FROM 11/12Z MOS...SO NUDGING POPS UP TO LOW

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE REGION THIS EVENING. CLOUDS
HAVE DECREASED WITH THE LOSS OF HEATING...BUT SOME SCATTERED CLOUDS
MAY REMAIN THROUGH THE NIGHT AS MOISTURE REMAINS TRAPPED BELOW A
STRONG INVERSION NEAR 750 MB IN THE 00Z OHX SOUNDING. THIS SHOULD
NOT HAVE MUCH IMPACT ON THE CURRENT FORECAST. PATCHY FOG MAY
DEVELOP IN NORTHERN AREAS NEAR BODIES OF WATER...BUT WILL PROBABLY
NOT BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO MENTION. EVERYTHING LOOKS TO BE ON
TRACK...SO NO UPDATE IS PLANNED.

.AVIATION...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE ACROSS THE
REGION...KEEPING CONDITIONS VFR FOR A MAJORITY OF THE PERIOD.
PATCHY FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE AT TRI FOR A FEW HOURS TOMORROW MORNING
SO HAVE INCLUDED MVFR VIS RESTRICTIONS IN BR. LOWER VSBYS WILL BE
POSSIBLE BUT THIS IS DEPENDENT ON HOW MUCH CLEARING OCCURS
OVERNIGHT...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW AT THIS TIME AND HAVE CHOSEN NOT TO
GO BELOW MVFR VIS.

258 PM EDT TUE SEP 11 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A WEAK TROUGH BRINGING A FEW 
CLOUDS TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. BUT WITH THE LACK OF MOISTURE A 
DRY FORECAST IS ANTICIPATED TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. MAY SEE PATCHY 
FOG LATE TONIGHT...BUT TOO ISOLATED TO INCLUDE IN THE FORECAST. 
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURE LOOKED REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY SO 
STAYED CLOSE WITH NEAR SEASONAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER 
THE AREA TO START THE PERIOD WILL SHIFT EAST AS A TROUGH DIGS INTO 
THE GREAT LAKES REGION.  A WEAK COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO PUSH INTO 
THE REGION...BUT LITTLE FORCING AND NOT MUCH MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD 
OF IT...SO WILL BACK POPS OFF SATURDAY TO SLIGHT CHANCE AND WILL 
REMOVE MENTION OF THUNDER. IF MODEL TRENDS CONTINUE SATURDAY MAY 
WELL END UP BEING PRECIP FREE. THINGS GET RATHER MURKY FOR THE 
SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY TIME FRAME...AS MODELS POOR 
AGREEMENT/CONSISTENCY LEADS TO LOWER THAN AVERAGE FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE.  00Z ECMWF SLOWER WITH NEXT WAVE...WHILE GFS QUITE 
AGGRESSIVE IN BRINGING NEXT PRECIP PRODUCER BY SUNDAY INTO MONDAY.  
GIVEN TIMING UNCERTAINTIES...WILL HAVE TO CARRY LOW POPS FOR SUNDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY...BUT PRECIP CHANCES WILL LIKELY END UP BEING 
CONTAINED IN A SMALLER TIME PERIOD.

358 AM EDT TUE SEP 11 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE RIDGE CENTERED OVER W
VA EXTENDING SOUTH INTO THE REGION THIS MORNING...PROVIDING MOSTLY
CLEAR SKIES AND PLEASANT TEMPS MAINLY IN THE 50S AT 07Z. UPPER
RIDGE BEGINS TO SPREAD EASTWARD BY TONIGHT...REPLACING THE WEAK
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THAT HAD BEEN OVER THE APPALACHIANS.

ANY FOG THIS MORNING SHOULD BE LIMITED TO NEAR AREA LAKES/STREAMS
AS WE ARE NOT SEEING MUCH FOG DEVELOP NEAR ANY TAF OR OBSERVATION
SITES AT THIS TIME. MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT...AFTER SCATTERED DAYTIME
CUMULUS CLOUDS BREAK-UP...ALTHO BOTH GFS AND NAM MODELS KEEP SOME
FAIRLY HIGH RH LINGERING OVERNIGHT AROUND 850 MB LEVEL. SO PERHAPS
SOME LINGERING PATCHES OF CLOUDS SIMILAR TO THIS MORNING.

GFS MOS MAXES GENERALLY FOLLOWED FOR TODAY...BUT A BIT CLOSER TO A 
MOS BLEND FOR MINS THAN COOLER GFS MINS. CAN'T COMPLAIN ABOUT THIS 
KIND OF WEATHER!


.LONG TERM.../TOMORROW THROUGH MONDAY/...
THE FAIRLY BENIGN AUTUMN-LIKE WEATHER PATTERN WILL PERSIST THROUGH 
THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE BECOMES SITUATED OVER THE SPINE OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS BY WEDNESDAY. THE ASSOCIATED HIGHER THICKNESS VALUES 
AND TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL PROMOTE A SLIGHT WARMING TREND AS HIGHS 
WILL CLIMB BACK INTO THE MID TO PERHAPS EVEN THE UPPER 80S IN A FEW 
LOCATIONS IN SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE BY FRIDAY. GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF 
THIS RIDGE...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE MINIMAL THROUGHOUT MUCH 
OF THE WEEK.

A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN WILL OCCUR LATE FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND AS 
AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO INTENSIFY AS IT 
ROTATES THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THOUGH THE 
ECMWF...GFS AND CFC ALL DIFFER SIGHTLY IN THEIR TIMING OF THIS 
SYSTEM...THEY ARE ALL INDICATING A COLD FRONT PUSHING THROUGH THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY SOMETIME ON SATURDAY. THIS FRONT /ALONG WITH A 
PREFRONTAL TROUGH THAT MAY PASS THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/ WILL GIVE THE 
REGION ITS FIRST REASONABLE SHOT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS IN ABOUT A 
WEEK. HAVE INCLUDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALONG THE PLATEAU ON FRIDAY 
NIGHT...BEFORE INCREASING THEM TO CHANCE POPS SATURDAY AND SATURDAY 
NIGHT AREAWIDE AS THE FRONT PASSES THROUGH. THEREAFTER...HAVE 
TAPERED THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ON SUNDAY AS THE FRONT PASSES TO 
THE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS. 

LATE IN THE PERIOD...MODELS ARE HINTING AT ANOTHER AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE MOVING NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. GIVEN THE ASSOCIATED 
GULF MOISTURE THAT COULD ACCOMPANY THIS SYSTEM...ADDITIONAL SHOWER 
AND STORM ACTIVITY MAY BE POSSIBLE HEADING INTO THE EARLY PART OF 
NEXT WEEK. WITH BOTH LONG-TERM MODEL SOLUTIONS INDICATING 
THIS...HAVE OPTED TO INTRODUCE LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS ON TUESDAY. 
BUT...GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED THIS FAR OUT...WILL 
CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL CONSISTENCY BEFORE MAKING ANY 
FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FORECAST.

TO RISE TO NEAR FORECAST MAXS ACROSS SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEYS. 
RETURN OF CLOUD COVER AND IMPENDING CONVECTION SHOULD HINDER FURTHER 
HEATING. THIS ALSO WILL KEEP DESTABILIZATION AT BAY SO STRENGTH OF 
STORMS SHOULD BE LIMITED. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER TODAY. PRECIPITATION WILL LINGER SOME 
BEHIND FRONT WITH SW FLOW ALOFT BRIEFLY. ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE INTO

WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. POPS WILL FALL OFF FROM THE WEST IN THE 
AFTERNOON...BUT HIGHEST POPS IN THE EASTERN MOST AREAS SHOULD OCCUR 
IN THE EARLY TO MID AFTERNOON HOURS. MAX TEMPS TRICKY BUT I TRENDED 
VERY CLOSE TO GFS MOS. THE WEAKENING TREND OF STORMS THIS MORNING 
INDICATES A STRONG STORM OR TWO AT BEST.

DROPPING MINS DOWN INTO SOME VERY PLEASANT UPPER 40S TO UPPER 50S. 
LITTLE IF ANY CHANGES MADE TO FORECAST GRIDS FOR TONIGHT.

THEN WARM SLOWLY AS TROUGH MOVES EAST AND RIDGING ALOFT MOVES INTO

UPPER TROUGH TAKING SHAPE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. MODEL PROGS DO 
NOT PHASE FRONT SIDE AND BACK SIDE JET SEGMENTS AS NICELY AS 
PREVIOUS RUNS. STRONG DIGGING ON BACK SIDE OF TROUGH WILL SLOW 
EASTERN PROGRESS OF DEVELOPING CONVECTION AND COLD FRONT. THERE ARE 
A FEW FEATURES WHICH WILL ALSO HINDER SEVERE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON SATURDAY. SW-NE FRONT SIDE JET 
SEGMENT WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY TONIGHT. THIS BRINGS 
WARMING AND INCREASED MOISTURE TO THE MID LEVELS. BULK SHEAR IS 35 
TO 40 KTS BUT IS UNIDIRECTIONAL AS CONVECTION MOVES EAST ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU SATURDAY MORNING. SEVERE PARAMETERS ARE LOW AS 
CONVECTION MOVES THROUGH THE MRX CWA MID MORNING THROUGH EARLY 
AFTERNOON. SURFACE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH AROUND MID DAY BUT UPPER 
TROUGH AXIS REMAINS WEST OF THE AREA INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. THIS 
WILL ALLOW CONVECTION TO CONTINUE ACROSS E AND NE AREAS INTO THE 
LATER PART OF THE AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE LITTLE AND WILL 
BE MOSTLY IN THE 70S. TROUGH AXIS MOVES THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WITH 
GOOD COLD AIR ADVECTION LOWERING H85 TEMPS TO NEAR 10C. SOME STRATO

LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE PROGGED BY LATEST MODELS SHOULD ENHANCE 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT ACROSS NE TN MNTS. ADDED ISOLATED CONVECTION TO 
THOSE AREAS FOR THIS AFTERNOON. LATE DAY WARM UP ON TRACK. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...PATCHY AREAS OF FOG NOTED 
THIS MORNING WITH SOME LOCALLY DENSE FOG ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN. WAS 
TEMPTED TO TOSS IN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSRA THIS AFTERNOON OVER ERN 
MTNS...BUT COVERAGE IF ANY WOULD BE VERY ISOLATED. TRENDED MAX TEMPS 
IN LINE WITH A MOS BLEND...WHICH WILL BE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE THE 
THURSDAY MAX TEMPS.

SHORT RANGE MODELS SEEM IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON RAIN CHANCES WITH 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT TO BE LATE TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY. FRONTAL 
PASSAGE SHOULD OCCUR IN THE AFTERNOON...EVEN FOR FAR EASTERN 
COUNTIES. A FEW STRONG STORMS ARE POSSIBLE AND I KEPT POPS FROM 
PREVIOUS GRIDS...WHICH WERE ABOUT 10 TO 20 PERCENT ABOVE THE LIKELY 
POPS FROM 07/00Z MOS. MOS MINS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT...THEN A 
DEGREE OR TWO BELOW THE WARMER GFS MOS MAXES FOR SATURDAY.

LONG TERM....(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS SPEED UP 
COLD FRONT AND SHOULD BE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS BY EVENING. A FEW 
LINGERING SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS OTHERWISE SKIES WILL CLEAR 
OVERNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS OVER THE REGION WITH 
MOSTLY SUNNY TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. MUCH 
COOLER LOWS SATURDAY NIGHT GENERALLY IN THE 50S WITH 40S IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. STAYED NEAR MEX AND HPC GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES. AS THE HIGH SETTLES OVER THE TN VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT 
AND MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN BELOW NORMAL. A WARMING TREND 
WILL BEGIN TUESDAY AND CONTINUE THROUGH THURSDAY WITH HIGHS NEAR 
NORMAL AND LOWS SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL AS DRY AIR MASS STAYS OVER THE 
AREA AND GULF MOISTURE REMAINS CUT OFF FROM THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...WARM AND MOIST LOW LEVEL AIRMASS
REMAINS IN PLACE ACROSS THE AREA. SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL PERSIST 
ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. SCATTERED AFTERNOON CONVECTION WILL 
LINGER INTO THE EVENING HOURS ...MAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS. A 
DECAYING CONVECTIVE COMPLEX MAY MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN PLATEAU FROM 
THE NORTHWEST EARLY TONIGHT. LATE NIGHT EARLY MORNING FOG WILL 
DEVELOP ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA. A WEAK MID LEVEL TROUGH AXIS WILL 
MOVE EAST OF THE AREA ON THURSDAY. CONVECTION SHOULD BE ISOLATED 
TOMORROW. LOW LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES RISE THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
TEMPS A COUPLE DEGREE WARMER ON THURSDAY. 
 
.LONG TERM /TOMORROW NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
A CHANGE IN THE PATTERN WILL OCCUR LATE THIS WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND 
AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH PASSES ACROSS THE EASTERN CONUS...DRIVING A 
COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. MODELS ARE 
ALL IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM AND SHOW 
INCREASING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS OVERSPREADING THE AREA 
FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL 
LIKELY TRIGGER SOME ACTIVITY ALONG THE WESTERN PLATEAU AREA FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON/EVENING. HOWEVER...A BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION FROM THIS 
EVENT SHOULD OCCUR DURING THE DAY ON SATURDAY...BEFORE BEGINNING TO 
WANE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES EAST OF THE 
MOUNTAINS. GIVEN THE HIGH BULK SHEAR VALUES AND JET ENERGY 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM...SOME ORGANIZED/STRONGER THUNDERSTORMS 
CANNOT BE RULED OUT. HOWEVER...MORE MODEST TALL/SKINNY CAPE PROFILES 
EXHIBITED BY MODEL SOUNDINGS AND PWATS AOA 2.0 INCHES INDICATE THAT 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE A MUCH BIGGER THREAT /PARTICULARLY IF 
TRAINING OCCURS/. 

IN WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM A MORE AUTUMN-LIKE AIR MASS WILL GET USHERED 
INTO THE REGION AS DAYTIME HIGHS WILL ONLY PEAK IN THE UPPER 70S TO 
LOWER 80S EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS DROPPING INTO THE 
UPPER 40S ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES SUNDAY/MONDAY NIGHTS. WITH 
ZONAL FLOW RETURNING AND A SURFACE RIDGE BUILDING BACK INTO THE 
LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY NEXT WEEK HOWEVER...MOSTLY SUNNY AND DRY 
CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED LATE IN THE PERIOD...ALONG WITH A GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND.

APPROACHING FROM THE WNW TODAY. THIS FEATURE WILL OFFER A BIT OF 
UPPER SUPPORT TO ADDITIONAL DIURNAL DEVELOPMENT. INCREASED CLOUDS 
AND POPS FOR TODAY...ESPECIALLY NORTHERN AREAS. SON

DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK TROUGH AXIS SLOWLY PUSHING 
THROUGH TODAY.  WITH CONTINUED ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER THE 
AREA...SHOULD SEE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOP THIS 
AFTERNOON.  BEST CHANCE WILL BE EAST OF THE AXIS WHICH SHOULD KEEP 
THE BULK OF THE SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE MRX CWA.  
A FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER OVERNIGHT...THOUGH COVERAGE SHOULD BE QUITE 
LIMITED AND WILL KEEP POPS AT SLIGHT CHANCE.

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN FEATURE FOR THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE THE UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT THAT MOVE IN 
BY SATURDAY.  BEFORE THAT WILL JUST CARRY SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY FOR SOME AFTERNOON CONVECTION...THEN LIKELY POPS 
SATURDAY AS THE UPPER TROUGH DIGS IN AND THE COLD FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH.  MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT THAT THIS WILL BE 
AN OPEN WAVE THAT MOVES THROUGH RATHER THAN A LINGERING UPPER LOW AS 
IN SOME PREVIOUS RUNS...SO PLAN TO JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
INTO SUNDAY THEN DRY MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  GFS MOS TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK TROUGH AXIS SLOWLY PUSHING 
THROUGH TODAY.  WITH CONTINUED ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER THE 
AREA...SHOULD SEE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOP THIS 
AFTERNOON.  BEST CHANCE WILL BE EAST OF THE AXIS WHICH SHOULD KEEP 
THE BULK OF THE SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE MRX CWA.  
A FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER OVERNIGHT...THOUGH COVERAGE SHOULD BE QUITE 
LIMITED AND WILL KEEP POPS AT SLIGHT CHANCE.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN FEATURE FOR THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE THE UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT THAT MOVE IN 
BY SATURDAY.  BEFORE THAT WILL JUST CARRY SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY FOR SOME AFTERNOON CONVECTION...THEN LIKELY POPS 
SATURDAY AS THE UPPER TROUGH DIGS IN AND THE COLD FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH.  MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT THAT THIS WILL BE 
AN OPEN WAVE THAT MOVES THROUGH RATHER THAN A LINGERING UPPER LOW AS 
IN SOME PREVIOUS RUNS...SO PLAN TO JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
INTO SUNDAY THEN DRY MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  GFS MOS TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS
AGAIN TODAY AS WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH LINGERS ACROSS THE EASTERN
OHIO AND TN VALLEYS. A PERSISTENT AREA OF SHOWERS CONTINUES ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS
POSSIBLY DEVELOPING NOW OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHEAST VALLEYS.
LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE THROUGH EARLY EVENING BUT ACTIVITY
SHOULD DECREASE AFTER SUNSET. TONIGHT AS CLOUD COVER DECREASES
PATCHY FOG SHOULD DEVELOP. BROAD TROUGH SHOULD SHIFT TO MAINLY EAST
OF THE APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY AS DRIER AIR MASS MOVES IN. A FINAL
SHORTWAVE WILL AFFECT THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH A
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. LOWS TONIGHT GOING WITH
PERSISTENCE LOWER 70S WITH UPPER 60S NE. WEDNESDAY FOLLOWED LOWER
GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR HIGHS SINCE THE LAST COUPLE DAYS HAVE HAD
LOWER HIGHS THAN FORECAST. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
NOT MUCH NEW WITH THIS FORECAST. EXPECTING RESIDUAL ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION DURING THE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE WEEK. 
UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONT STILL PROMPTING LIKELY POPS FOR 
SATURDAY. MODELS CONTINUE TO DIVERGE ON PLACEMENT OF THE UPPER TROF 
/OR CLOSED LOW/ POST-FRONTAL...THUS I CONTINUE WITH LOW POPS FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE EARLY DAYS OF NEXT WEEK...MAINLY THE NORTHEAST HALF

TODAY INTO EARLY TONIGHT...FORCING FOR PRECIP WILL REMAIN WEAK.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL 
MOVE THROUGH EARLY IN THE EXTENDED AND WITH MOISTURE FROM THE 
REMNANTS OF ISAAC IN PLACE...WILL CONTINUE TO SEE ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE MRX CWA WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  THE

ISAAC OUT FOR THE AREA FOR A BRIEF DRY PERIOD THURSDAY NIGHT.  A

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...
REMNANT UPPER LEVEL LOW ASSOCIATED WITH ISAAC APPROACHING THE
FORECAST AREA NOW OVER MIDDLE TN EXTENDING NORTH INTO SOUTHERN OH
WITH SURFACE LOW ACROSS SOUTHERN IN AND WESTERN KY AND TN. A NEARLY
STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY LIES ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND WEST
TN/WEST KY. THE SURFACE LOW WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST ALONG THE OHIO
RIVER AND THEN INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY TUESDAY NIGHT WITH
THE FRONT APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA BY 00Z WEDNESDAY. AS A
RESULT EXPECT VERY HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT AND SHOWERS LIKELY WITH A
FEW THUNDERSTORMS. SKIES TODAY HAVE HAD FEW BREAKS AND WHERE
SHOWERS HAVE LINGERED TEMPERATURES HAVE STAYED IN THE 70S.
INSTABILITY HAS BEEN LOWER ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION THEN
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS AND WELL TO THE SOUTH IN GA. THIS HAS
LIMITED THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT SO FAR ACROSS THE REGION. JUST
STARTING TO GET A FEW BREAKS WHICH MAY FUEL SOME THUNDERSTORMS OVER
THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. THERE COULD BE SOME HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE
STORMS BETWEEN NOW AND AROUND MIDNIGHT TONIGHT BUT ONLY IN ISOLATED
LOCATIONS. KEPT SHOWERS LIKELY AND ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE THUNDER FOR
THE EVENING. THINK TUESDAY THERE MAY BE A FEW MORE BREAKS SO HAVE
HIGHS SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN WHAT WAS EXPECTED TODAY. INSTABILITY A
LITTLE HIGHER TOO SO EXPECT BETTER CHANCE OF THUNDER. LOWS TONIGHT
ABOUT THE SAME AS THE LAST SEVERAL NIGHTS NEAR 70...ABOUT A DEGREE
ABOVE GUIDANCE TRENDS FOR MOST SITES.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
INCREASED MOISTURE THANKS TO REMNANTS OF ISAAC WILL KEEP THE AREA 
UNDER A MOSTLY DIURNAL CONVECTIVE REGIME EARLY IN THE EXTENDED. 
THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE AT A MINIMUM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT...THEN NEW WEATHER CHANGER COMES INTO VIEW. MODELS IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT ON A LONG WAVE TROUGH TO MOVE INTO EASTERN U.S. LATE WEEK. 
THIS WILL OF COURSE BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SURFACE COLD FRONT WHICH 
WILL BRING RAIN AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA...PEAKING ON SATURDAY. 
WENT LIKELY POPS AREA WIDE FOR SATURDAY. AFTER THE FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH AND CLEARS OUT THE CONVECTION...A QUESTION REMAINS ABOUT THE 
LOCATION OF THE POTENTIAL CLOSED LOW IN THE COOL AIR. SO I WILL 
MAINTAIN SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR THE NORTH HALF OF CWA SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY. COOLER TEMPS IN STORE FOLLOWING THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...AT 
OR BELOW NORMAL FOR THE NEW WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...THE REMNANT LOW OF ISAAC WAS LOCATED ALONG THE LOWER
OHIO RIVER NEAR EVANSVILLE IN THIS MORNING AND HAD MOVED LITTLE
OVER THE LAST FEW HOURS. THIS FEATURE WILL MAKE SLOW PROGRESS EAST.
VERY MOIST AIR MASS LIES OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH CLOUDY SKIES. A
FEW BREAKS WERE LOCATED OVER SE TN. RAIN SHOWERS WERE MOVING ACROSS
MOST OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH MORE SHOWERS
DEVELOPING OVER THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND MOVING INTO NORTHERN
MIDDLE TN. OVERALL FORECAST LOOKS GOOD BUT DROPPED HIGHS A COUPLE
DEGREES AS CLOUD COVER AND FREQUENT SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
SHOULD SLOW TEMPERATURE RISE THIS AFTERNOON. A FEW LOCATIONS MAY
REACH THE UPPER 80S IF ENOUGH BREAKS FORM. PRECIPITABLE WATER
VALUES ARE VERY HIGH ABOVE 2.00 INCHES AND HEAVY RAINFALL THAT
COULD PRODUCE LOCALIZED FLOODING IS POSSIBLE WITH ANY THUNDERSTORM
DEVELOPMENT. ADDED HEAVY RAINFALL FOR AFTERNOON PERIOD TO MATCH
WORDING IN HWO. BEST CHANCE OF SEVERE WILL BE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE
REGION WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE GREATEST BUT A FEW STORMS MAY
BECOME STRONG DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING.

SHORT TERM PERIOD. WITH PW VALUES GENERALLY ABOVE 2 INCHES...SOME OF 
THE RAIN MAY BE HEAVY AT TIMES. HOWEVER...AT THIS TIME THREAT FOR 
ANY FLOODING LOOKS TO BE LOCALIZED...SO WILL JUST MENTION IN HWO.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...OHIO VALLEY UPPER TROUGH AND

EASTWARD TOWARD THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS. MAINTAINED LIKELY 
POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO SHOW THIS WIDESPREAD RAIN PRODUCING FEATURE FINALLY 
SHIFTS EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...A FAIR 
AMOUNT OF MOISTURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
AND WITH SOME INSTABILITY PROGGED FELT IT WAS BEST TO HOLD ONTO A 
LOW CHANCE POP ON WEDNESDAY. WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH AND COOL FRONT 
BUILD INTO THE REGION ON THURSDAY WHICH MAY SPARK A COUPLE SHOWERS 
AND A THUNDERSTORM. BY FRIDAY AIRMASS SHOULD BE A LITTLE DRIER BUT 
CONVECTION STILL POSSIBLE...MAINLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES SO 
USED A SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY HERE. MODELS DIFFER ON TIMING AND 
STRENGTH OF NEXT UPPER TROUGH FOR THE WEEKEND. THE AMPLIFIED SYSTEM 
SHOULD BRING MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE FORECAST AREA

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
THE SLOW EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE REMNANT LOW FROM ISSAC AND A VERY 
MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE WITH PW VALUES ABOVE 2 INCHES WILL MAKE FOR A 
WET SHORT TERM PERIOD. AFTER A ROUND OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
PASSES THROUGH THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON...ANOTHER ROUND IS SHOWN BY 
THE NAM AND THE RUC ARRIVING TOWARD MIDNIGHT. STRONG TO SEVERE 
STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ACROSS NORTHERN MS/AL IN A LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE ZONE AND THETA-E MAX...AND MOVE NORTHEAST INTO OUR AREA. 
WHILE THE STORMS SHOULD LOSE SOME INTENSITY DUE TO DIMINISHING 
SURFACE-BASED INSTABILITY...SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY AND A 30-40 
KT LLJ WILL HELP KEEP A CHANCE OF STRONG STORMS IN THE SOUTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN TN VALLEY TONIGHT. GUSTY WINDS AND 
HEAVY RAIN WILL BE THE MAIN THREATS. CATEGORICAL POPS WILL CONTINUE 
FROM TONIGHT THROUGH THE DAY MONDAY AS THE CLOSED CYCLONIC 
CIRCULATION MOVES DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA. WHILE THE BEST DYNAMICS 
FOR LIFT WILL BE TO OUR EAST...COOLING MIDLEVEL TEMPS UNDER THE LOW 
AND A TROPICAL AIR MASS WILL KEEP PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS GOING THROUGH THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
WEAKENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SLIDES SOUTHEAST AND LOSES IDENTITY 
OVER THE EAST TN VALLEY EARLY IN THE PERIOD. LAYER MOISTURE REMAINS 
HIGH WITH ABOVE NORMAL PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND TEMPERATURES 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. DEEPER MOISTURE SHIFTS EAST FOR THE LATER HALF OF 
THE WEAK WITH DIURNAL CONVECTION FAVORING THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
MODELS CONTINUE TREND OF DEVELOPING STRONG TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN 
U.S. BY LATE IN THE PERIOD. SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATE SAT OR EARLY SUN. STRONG 
CONVECTION A POSSIBILITY SAT AHEAD OF FRONT. TROUGH AXIS REMAINS 
WEST OF AREA SUNDAY WITH LINGERING PRECIPITATION CHANCES. DRY 
CONDITIONS AND COOL NIGHTS SETTING UP FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK.

109 PM EDT SUN SEP 2 2012

.AVIATION...
A VERY MOIST ENVIRONEMENT COMBINED WITH AN APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM WILL MAKE FOR A VERY WET FORECAST THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS.
EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE TWO MAIN ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS AT THE TERMINALS - FIRST THIS AFTERNOON WITHIN THE
FIRST 6 HOURS OF THE TAF...WHICH SHOULD PRODUCE TS AND MVFR
CONDTIONS AT ALL SITES. GUSTY WINDS MAY ALSO OCCUR. A SECOND ROUND
IS EXPECTED TOWARD MIDNIGHT AS STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS THAT
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON OVER NORTHERN AL MOVE NORTHEAST. CONFIDENCE
IS HIGHEST AT CHA...SO WILL MENTION IFR CONDITIONS FOR A FEW
HOURS...WITH IFR VIS AT TYS AND MVFR VIS/CIGS AT TRI LATE TONIGHT.
GUSTS AT OR ABOVE 20 KTS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE WITH THE STORMS
TONIGHT. POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS AND MVFR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE AT
ALL SITES THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING...THOUGH TIMING OF PRECIP IS
LESS CERTAIN.

.DISCUSSION...
THUNDERSTORMS OVER MIDDLE TN HAVE SHOWN A WEAKENING TREND OVER THE
PAST FEW HOURS AS THEY MOVE CLOSER TO OUR AREA. STORMS ARE
DEVELOPING OVER NORTHERN AL THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN VALLEY
THROUGH THE EARLY AFTERNOON. ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED
AREA-WIDE AS DIURNAL HEATING PICKS UP THIS AFTERNOON. THE CURRENT
POP/WX FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK. TEMPERATURES ARE IN LINE WITH OBS
AS WELL...SO NO UPDATE IS NEEDED OTHER THAN TO REMOVE MORNING
WORDING IN THE ZFP.

WILL BE WATCHING THE DEVELOPMENT OF STORMS ACROSS NORTHERN MS/AL
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WHICH MAY HAVE SOME SEVERE POTENTIAL.
THESE STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES AND THE
SOUTHERN VALLEY TOWARD MIDNIGHT...AFTER HEATING AND DESTABILIZATION IS
LOST. WHILE THE STORMS SHOULD WEAKEN BEFORE REACHING OUR
AREA...SOME MAY REMAIN STRONG THROUGH THE NIGHT...WITH GUSTY WINDS
AND HEAVY RAIN BEING THE MAIN THREATS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...REMNANTS OF ISAAC WILL DRAW CLOSER 
DURING THE PERIOD. PLENTY OF MOISTURE REMAINS OVER THE AREA...AND 
WITH INCREASED FORCING SHOULD SEE MORE COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TODAY AND TONIGHT.  WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS MUCH OF THE 
AREA TODAY AND ALL ZONES TONIGHT.  SHOULD BE ENOUGH FLOW TO KEEP 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING...BUT WITH HIGH PW VALUES AND 
INCREASING LOW LEVEL FLOW CERTAINLY COULD SEE SOME HEAVY RAINS AND 
THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCALIZED FLOODING. WILL MENTION THIS THREAT IN 
HWO...BUT THREAT LOOKS TOO LOCALIZED FOR ANY FFA AT THIS POINT.  
JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS FOR THE SHORT TERM.    

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SLOW MOVING MID SOUTH LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM BUILDS EAST ACROSS THE REGION ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES HOLD STEADY AROUND TWO INCHES AS THE 
PERSISTENT SOUTHERLY FLOW OF VAPOR CONTINUES TO STREAM NORTH FROM 
THE GULF OF MEXICO. CHECKING OUT SOUNDINGS REVEALS A MOIST ADIABATIC 
PROFILE BUT BELIEVE CONVECTION WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY 
DURING THE DAYTIME PERIODS BOTH DAYS. TWEAKED POPS UP TO SEVENTY 
PERCENT ON MONDAY AND ADJUSTED TO SIXTY PERCENT ON TUESDAY AS THE 
REMNANT LOW WEAKENS WHILE SHIFTING SLOWLY EAST. MODELS PUSH THE WEAK 
TROUGH EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS BY WEDNESDAY BUT SUFFICIENT MOISTURE 
AND INSTABILITY LINGERS IN CYCLONIC FLOW REGIME WITH AMPLIFYING 
GREAT LAKES UPPER TROUGH AT MID WEEK SO MAINTAINED LOW TO MEDIUM 
CHANCE POPS FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM. ECMWF/GFS SHOW A DRYING 
TREND THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY WHILE A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPS SOUTH 
ACROSS THE REGION. WITH BOUNDARY IN THE AREA THURSDAY HELD ONTO 
SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS BUT REMOVED THE CHANCE OF RAIN ON FRIDAY. 
MODELS NOT IN AGREEMENT ON TIMING OF NEXT UPPER TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM DUE IN THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY WITH 
GFS PREDICTING FASTER MOVEMENT AND ECMWF SLOWER. WENT WITH THE 
QUICKER GFS AND ONLY APPLIED A LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION 
WITH THE FRONT FOR THIS REMOTE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)... 
THE REMNANTS OF ISSAC WILL BEGIN TO MOVE EASTWARD INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY THROUGH SUNDAY. THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL SHIFT EAST TOWARD THE COAST TONIGHT.
THIS WILL PROVIDE A BIT MORE ORGANIZED LIFT OVER THE AREA. WHILE
SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL BE GREATEST THIS AFTERNOON AND TOMORROW
AFTERNOON DUE TO DESTABILIZATION...UPPER DIVERGENCE AND FALLING
MIDLEVEL HEIGHTS MAY KEEP SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS GOING AFTER
MIDNIGHT. POPS INCREASE TO LIKELY BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON AS THE LOW
PRESSURE CENTER MOVES INTO SOUTHERN IN/IL AND WESTERN KY. WHILE
SHOWERS WILL BE NUMEROUS...THUNDER SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED IN THE
TROPICAL ENVIRONMENT. FOR TEMPERATURES...STAYED NEAR PERSISTENCE
FOR LOWS TONIGHT...AND NEAR A BLEND OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS
SUNDAY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...TROPICAL LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM TRACKING OVER THE REGION ON SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WITH
DEEP MOISTURE AVAILABLE. MAINTAINED A GOOD CHANCE POP WITH LIKELY
POPS ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND LIKELY
CHANCES AREA WIDE ON MONDAY. UPPER TROUGH IN PLACE BRINGING A
CHANCE OF SHOWERS JUST WEST OF THE APPALACHIANS AND DEEP MOISTURE
AXIS OVER THE REGION. LOWERED POPS A BIT ON TUESDAY BUT GOOD CHANCE

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE OLD 
TROPICAL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MAKING SLOW PROGRESS ACROSS THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WITH DEEP MOISTURE AVAILABLE FOR 
LIFTING. MAINTAINED A GOOD CHANCE POP WITH LIKELY POPS ON THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT BUT ADJUSTED INTO THE 
LIKELY CATEGORY FORECAST AREA WIDE ON MONDAY WITH UPPER TROUGH IN 
PLACE JUST WEST OF THE APPALACHIANS AND DEEP MOISTURE AXIS OVER THE

PROBABILITIES WITH WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH IN THE VICINITY. WOULD 
EXPECT DIURNAL ENHANCEMENT OF CONVECTION WITH A REDUCTION IN 
COVERAGE AT NIGHT FOR THE PERIOD SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. 
TROPICAL TROUGH WILL BE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS BY WEDNESDAY AND SO 
LOWERED POPS AREA WIDE TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM 
BUT BUMPED UP TO LOW CHANCE RANGE ON THURSDAY AS MODELS CONTINUE TO 
SHOW AN AMPLIFYING TROUGH BUILDING EAST THROUGH THE NORTH CENTRAL 
STATES ON ITS WAY INTO THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. THE MODELS HAVE BEEN 
ADVERTISING A SYNOPTIC COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACCOMPANYING THIS 
SYSTEM WITH ARRIVAL ON THURSDAY. UNCERTAINTY AS TO HOW FAR THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
THE REMNANTS OF ISSAC WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY OVER MO
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM...WITH A RIDGE REMAINING OVER THE CAROLINAS
AND GA. GULF MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO FEED INTO THE AREA...WITH
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES OVER 2 INCHES. HOWEVER...MUCH LIKE TODAY
AND YESTERDAY...LIFT THROUGH THE PERIOD WILL BE VERY WEAK. THUS ANY
SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN...AND COVERAGE SHOULD
REMAIN SCATTERED. SO POPS WILL DROP BACK TO A SLIGHT CHANCE AFTER
00Z THIS EVENING...THEN TO NO CHANCE AFTER MIDNIGHT. CHANCE POPS
RETURN SATURDAY AFTERNOON. PERSISTENCE WILL BE FOLLOWED FOR TEMPS
TONIGHT...AS THE GFS MOS GUIDANCE HAS BEEN WAY TOO COOL THE PAST
SEVERAL NIGHTS. WITH BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUDS EXPECTED ACROSS THE
ENTIRE AREA TOMORROW...HIGH TEMPS SHOULD PEAK IN THE 80S EVERYWHERE
OUTSIDE THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE REMNANTS OF
ISAAC WILL AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA LATER IN THE WEEKEND AND EARLY
NEXT WEEK AS IT MOVES EAST FROM MO INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BEGINNING
SATURDAY NIGHT AND MERGES WITH A FRONTAL SYSTEM SUNDAY. RAIN
CHANCES WILL INCREASE SUNDAY WITH HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY THROUGH
TUESDAY. THE FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS KY TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY WITH ADDITIONAL FRONTAL DEVELOPMENT BEHIND THE FIRST
SYSTEM THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIGHT
SATURDAY NIGHT AND THEN INCREASE SUNDAY. THE LARGEST TOTALS LOOK TO
BE SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AS THE DEEPER MOISTURE ASSOCIATED
WITH ISAAC MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH INCREASING LIFT AHEAD
OF THE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. NIGHT TIME TEMPERATURES
WILL STAY ABOVE NORMAL AND DAY TIME HIGHS NEAR NORMAL WITH PARTLY
SUNNY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED.

EAST TN IS IN A TRANSITION ZONE BETWEEN A VERY MOIST TROPICAL
AIRMASS AND A DRY HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO OUR EAST. THE 12Z OHX
SOUNDING SHOWS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WELL OVER 2 INCHES...WHILE
RNK IS UNDER 1 INCH. A SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF BROKEN TO
OVERCAST CLOUD COVER IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE DAY AS THE 500 MB
RIDGE MOVES FARTHER TOWARD THE COAST. PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN
LIGHT IN THE WESTERN HALF AS LIFT IS VERY WEAK AND INSTABILITY
WILL BE LIMITED BY CLOUD COVER. AFTERNOON SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO
DEVELOP NORTHEAST WHERE HEATING WILL BE GREATER...BUT COVERAGE
SHOULD REMAIN ISOLATED AS MOISTURE IS LIMITED THERE. THE CURRENT
FORECAST POPS AND TEMPS LOOK TO BE ON TRACK...SO NO UPDATE IS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH ISAAC 
WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD INTO THE AREA...BUT STILL LITTLE FORCING FOR 
THE SHORT TERM.  INSTABILITY ALSO UNIMPRESSIVE. WILL HAVE CHANCE 
POPS MAINLY SOUTH AND WEST...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE ELSEWHERE TODAY.  
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TONIGHT.  WILL MENTION THUNDER TODAY...BUT NO 
MORE THAN SLIGHT CHANCE...THEN JUST SHOWERS TONIGHT.  WITH QUITE A 
BIT OF CLOUD COVER TODAY ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND WEST WILL GENERALLY GO 
SLIGHTLY BELOW MAV TEMPS.  SHOULD BE QUITE A FEW CLOUDS ALL ZONES 
TONIGHT SO WILL GO SLIGHTLY ABOVE FOR MOST MAV MINS FOR TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...LOOKS LIKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF THE FORECAST WILL BE DOMINATED BY WHAT WAS 
ONCE ISAAC. THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SHIFT NORTH INTO THE 
MIDWEST STATES BY SATURDAY AND THEN WILL BE NUDGED ALONG BY THE 
WESTERLIES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. MODEL FORECASTS 
GRADUALLY INCREASE MEAN RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND LIFT ESPECIALLY LATER 
IN THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND AS THE SOUTHERLY FLOW STRENGTHENS A BIT WITH 
THE APPROACH OF THIS FEATURE. THEREFORE BASICALLY TWEAKED POPS UP A 
BIT ON SUNDAY WHILE MAINTAINING GOOD CHANCE POPS ON SATURDAY AND 
MONDAY WITH DEEP MOISTURE AND ADEQUATE LIFT PERSISTING WITH THE SLOW 
MOVING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. UNCERTAINTY IN EXACTLY HOW QUICKLY THE 
REMNANTS OF ISAAC DEPART TO THE EAST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION REQUIRED ONLY GRADUALLY DECREASING PROBABILITY OF 
PRECIPITATION DURING THE WORK WEEK AS A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY TRIES 
TO ADVANCE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. NOT SURE HOW MUCH 
PROGRESS THIS FRONT WILL MAKE AND THE BOUNDARY MAY STALL OVER THE 
REGION WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY SO KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP AT THE 
END OF THE PERIOD. TRENDED A LITTLE BELOW MEX MOS MAX TEMPS THROUGH 
MUCH OF THE FORECAST AS THE SUGGESTED WELL ABOVE NORMAL HIGHS LOOK A 
LITTLE TOO WARM IN THIS UNSETTLED PATTERN.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
AS THE REMNANTS OF ISSAC TRACK N-NW...A MID-UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER
THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY WILL BUILD OVER THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS TONIGHT....THEN SHIFT TO VA/NC ON FRIDAY. IN THE LOW
LEVELS...STATIONARY HIGH PRESSURE OVER GA/SC WILL CONTINUE TO PUMP
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. WITH NO DISCERNIBLE LIFTING
MECHANISMS BENEATH THE BUILDING RIDGE...THE DIURNALLY-DRIVEN SHOWER
ACTIVITY NOW OCCURRING SHOULD DISSIPATE BEFORE MIDNIGHT. A DENSE
CIRRUS SHIELD SHOULD REMAIN IN PLACE TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD HELP
HOLD TEMPS UP. GFS MOS HAS BEEN TOO COOL THE PAST FEW NIGHTS...SO
WILL GO ABOVE GUIDANCE FOR LOW TEMPS.

FOR FRIDAY...SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS WILL HAVE LESS INFLUENCE 
FROM THE UPPER RIDGE...AND WILL ALSO HAVE THE BEST MOISTURE
ADVECTION. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES RISE TO NEAR 2 INCHES AT CHA
IN THE NAM. THE HIGHEST POPS TOMORROW WILL BE IN SOUTHERN AND
WESTERN AREAS. STILL...SYNOPTIC LIFT IS WEAK...SO WILL KEEP POPS IN
THE CHANCE RANGE WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTHEAST UNDER THE RIDGE.
WILL FOLLOW PERSISTENCE FOR HIGH TEMPS TOMORROW...IN THE MID AND
UPPER 80S IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
LATEST MODEL RUNS SHOW THE FORECAST AREA ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF
THE TROPICAL AIR MASS ASSOCIATED WITH THE REMNANTS OF ISAAC THIS
WEEKEND. SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE FRIDAY
NIGHT AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS ISAAC MOVES NORTHEAST THROUGH THE
OHIO VALLEY. RAINFALL AMOUNTS DO NOT APPEAR TO BE THAT GREAT
THROUGH SATURDAY BUT MAY REACH ONE TO THREE INCHES FOR THE PERIOD
FROM SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY OR MONDAY NIGHT. THE
BEST CONSENSUS FOR THE REMNANTS OF ISAACS TRACK IS FROM A LOCATION
OVER MO EARLY SATURDAY TO MOVE SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY
THROUGH TUESDAY. THE PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL LINGER AS IT JOINS
WITH A FRONTAL SYSTEM SUNDAY THAT MOVES SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY. GFS DOES SHOW A SECONDARY FRONT
MOVING THROUGH THURSDAY. ECMWF DOES SHOW A DRYING TREND THURSDAY
WITHOUT THE SECONDARY FRONT. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCES OF RAIN FOR
THE LAST 2 DAYS OF THE FORECAST BUT EITHER WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY
MAY BE DRY IF THE FRONT THAT PICKS UP ISAAC MOVES THROUGH FASTER.
MILD LOW TEMPERATURES THE NEXT SEVERAL NIGHTS IN THE MID 60S TO

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LATEST GFS AND ECMWF MODEL
RUNS ARE SHOWING SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE PATH OF THE REMNANT
LOW OF ISAAC THIS WEEKEND...BUT STILL INDICATE THAT ITS ASSOCIATED
MOISTURE WILL COMBINE WITH A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER
THE TN RIVER VALLEY TO CREATE SCATTERED CONVECTION ON FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS BRING THE REMNANTS OF ISAAC
INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY THIS WEEKEND...BUT THE LATEST GFS MODEL
RUN INDICATES A MORE NORTHERLY TRACK THAN THE ECMWF MODEL...AND
CONSEQUENTLY KEEPS THE BULK OF ISAAC'S MOISTURE NORTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA. FOR NOW...WILL TREND THE FORECAST TOWARD THE MORE
SOUTHERLY ECMWF SOLUTION...SINCE THE ECMWF MODEL HAS BEEN MORE
CONSISTENT LATELY AND ALSO HAS SUPPORT FROM THE CANADIAN MODEL.
THIS ECMWF SOLUTION INDICATES THE POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY RAINFALL
OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WITH WIDESPREAD
RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF TWO TO THREE INCHES POSSIBLE. A COLD FRONT IS
THEN PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON
TUESDAY...TRIGGERING ADDITIONAL CONVECTION ON TUESDAY BUT BRINGING
DRIER WEATHER ON WEDNESDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND
TOWARDS THE GFS NUMBERS WITH MINS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT
WILL TREND COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE WITH MAXES DUE TO THE

ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. THE REGION
IS ON THE EDGE OF A DEFORMATION ZONE...WITH DRY AIR PUSHING SOUTH
FROM THE OHIO VALLEY AND A MORE MOIST...TROPICAL AIR MASS PUSHING
NORTH FROM THE GULF COAST AS TROPICAL STORM ISAAC CONTINUES TO TRACK

MAINTAIN/ENHANCE A STATIONARY FRONT CURRENTLY DRAPED ACROSS SE
TENNESSEE AND WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA OVERNIGHT. THIS FRONT...ALONG

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
EAST TN HAS BEEN LOCATED DIRECTLY BENEATH A SADDLE POINT IN THE 
850-500 MB FLOW TODAY...AND THE RESULTING DEFORMATION HAS HELPED TO 
SPARK A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL 
SECTIONS. DIURNAL HEATING IS ALSO DRIVING THE SHOWERS...AND PRECIP 
IS EXPECTED TO END WITHIN A FEW HOURS OF SUNSET. A BOUNDARY 
SEPARATING MORE STABLE AIR TO THE NORTH APPEARS TO BE LOCATED 
BETWEEN TYS AND MRX. THE MODELS SHOW THE DEFORMATION ZONE DRIFTING 
NORTHWARD TONIGHT...WITH THE STABILITY BOUNDARY DRIFTING NORTHWARD 
AS WELL TOMORROW. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO SHOWER ACTIVITY PUSHING 
SLIGHTLY NORTHWARD TOMORROW AFTERNOON. MUCH LIKE TODAY...COVERAGE IS

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
ABUNDANT MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH ISAAC WILL CONTINUE TO PINWHEEL
INTO E TN AND SW NC THROUGH THE REMAINING WEEK. THUS LOW END RAIN
CHANCES THROUGH FRIDAY CAN BE EXPECTED.

THERE WERE VERY MINOR DIFFERENCES NOTED IN THE 6Z AND 12Z GFS MODEL 
RUNS WHICH LEAD TO ONLY MINOR CHANGES TO THIS FORECAST PERIOD. THE 
ECMWF IS IN THE PROCESS OF RUNNING BUT UNAVAILABLE FOR VIEWING AT 
THIS TIME. THE GENERAL TRACK OF ISAAC WILL KEEP IT ACROSS ARKANSAS 
INTO FRIDAY AND THEN THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY NEXT MONDAY. SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL BE THE HIGHEST OVER THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND 
BUT THERE IS STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH TIMING AND THE ACTUAL TRACK 
ISAAC TAKES. RIGHT NOW...WE BELIEVE THAT EVENTUALLY...THE UPPER LEVEL 
FLOW WILL STEER WHAT IS LEFT OF ISAAC ACROSS E TN AS EARLY AS SUNDAY 
INTO MONDAY. THROUGH MONDAY...THE HEAVIEST AVERAGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
OF AROUND ONE INCH WILL OCCUR ACROSS SW NC AND SE TN. LIGHTEST 
AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED OVER SW VA AND VALLEY LOCATION IN NE TN. /AC

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS
EXPECTED TO TRACK INTO THE REGION ALLOWING FOR THE CHANCE OF
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING TODAY. WILL CONTINUE
WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN AREAS FOR TODAY.
TEMPERATURE SHOULD REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL AGAIN. MAV GUIDANCE LOOKED
ON THE HIGH SIDE FOR TEMPERATURES WITH THE EXTRA CLOUDS...SO STAYED
NEAR THE MET/MAV BLEND TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY. THE FRONTAL
BOUNDARY LINGERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...SO KEPT
THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THOSE AREAS FOR TONIGHT. GUIDANCE
TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT SO STAYED CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN REASONABLE
AGREEMENT WITH THE PROGRESSION OF THE REMNANTS OF ISAAC IN THE
EXTENDED PERIOD...AND INDICATE THAT ITS ASSOCIATED MOISTURE WILL
COMBINE WITH A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE TN RIVER
VALLEY TO CREATE SCATTERED CONVECTION EACH DAY INTO THE WEEKEND.
ISAAC IS EXPECTED TO SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHWARD INTO THE OZARKS REGION
ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...AND SHOULD THEN DRIFT INTO THE MID MS
RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY. THEREAFTER...THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS
BEGIN TO DISAGREE WITH THE SPEED OF THE REMNANTS OF ISAAC...BUT
GENERALLY AGREE THAT THESE REMNANTS WILL DRIFT SOUTHEASTWARD INTO
THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON SUNDAY OR MONDAY. THIS SCENARIO WOULD RESULT
IN THE POSSIBILITY OF HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY
SUNDAY NIGHT AND INTO MONDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION THIS
POSSIBILITY IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED
PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY NEAR THE 
WESTERN EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL STRUGGLE INTO THE REGION 
TONIGHT WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM. THE 
BETTER CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE ACROSS SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WITH 
DEEPER MOISTURE CIRCULATING AROUND ISAAC WITH UPSLOPE COMPONENT 
AIDING LIFT. KEPT A MEDIUM CHANCE POP GOING FOR EXTREME SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AS WELL. THE FRONT WILL EDGE SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY WITH LINGERING MOISTURE SOUTH OF THE 
FRONT WHICH MAY BE LINGERING NEAR I-40 THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. 
AGAIN KEPT BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WITH A DRY FORECAST 
FARTHER NORTH. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO 
DEPICT A MORE NWRLY TRACK OF ISAAC. EARLY IN THE PERIOD...THE 
DEFORMATION ZONE OVER THE AREA WILL GIVE WAY TO HIGH PRESSURE WHICH 
DROPS INTO THE APPALACHIANS. THIS TREND LEADS TO SINKING MOTIONS IN 
THE MID LEVELS AND AN OVERALL DRIER AIRMASS. ADJUSTED POPS DOWNWARD 
THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY. CIRCULATION OF ISAAC MAY NOT GET PICKED UP 
BY STRONGEST SEGMENTS OF NORTHERN STREAM WHICH KEEPS IT LINGERING IN 
THE OH VALLEY THIS WEEKEND. PWATS RISE TO ABOVE 2.00 ACROSS THE 
REGION AND PRECIPITATION PROSPECTS INCREASING SUNDAY INTO EARLY NEXT

PRECIP BECAUSE THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD BASICALLY REMAIN IN AN AREA
OF RELATIVELY DRY AIR BETWEEN THE MOIST ENVIRONMENT ACROSS THE
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. ASSOCIATED WITH ISAAC AND A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY
IN PLACE ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. THE FRONT IS MOVING SOUTH
AT AN AMAZINGLY SLOW SPEED AND DON'T BELIEVE IT WILL BE MUCH OF A

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...THE FORECAST AREA WILL RESIDE IN 
A RELATIVE MINIMUM OF CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP TONIGHT AS SUBSIDENCE 
FROM THE TROPICAL SYSTEM STRENGTHENS A BIT. A WEAK COOL FRONT WILL 
BE MAKING STEADY PROGRESS TOWARD SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS 
EVENING AND SHOULD ARRIVE ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY DAYBREAK. THE 
MODELS SEEM TO BE DOING A GOOD JOB OF DOWNPLAYING PROBABILITY OF 
PRECIP FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. 
BELIEVE THIS IS THE WAY TO GO WITH SUBSIDENCE AROUND ISAAC AND A 
DOWNSLOPING EASTERLY FLOW. WOULD EXPECT THE BEST CHANCE FOR A SHOWER 
OR THUNDERSTORM WOULD BE ON THE PLATEAU AND ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA ON TUESDAY AS THE TROPICAL SYSTEM WEAKENED COOL FRONT LIMPS 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. ALSO...THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE 
TENNESSEE BORDER AS WELL AS SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WILL SEE A 
LITTLE BETTER CHANCE OF RAIN DUE TO OROGRAPHIC COMPONENT WITH THE 
DEVELOPING EASTERLY WIND. PICKED MAX/MIN TEMPERATURES FROM A 
GUIDANCE BLEND.              

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION BETWEEN MID LEVEL TROUGH TO THE NE AND TROPICAL SYSTEM ISAAC 
TO THE SW EARLY IN THE PERIOD. SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN FROM 
THE NW AND STALL ACROSS THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY. SHEAR AXIS 
ASSOCIATED WITH NE TROUGH WILL LINE UP WITH SURFACE FRONT. CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION N OF THIS BOUNDARY LOOKING LESS IMPRESSIVE WITH CHANCE 
CONTINUING SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY IN DEEPER MOISTURE. AS THE REMNANTS 
OF ISAAC TRAVEL NNW THROUGH THE MS RIVER VALLEY THROUGH FRIDAY 
CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION REMAINS RATHER LOW WHEN CONSIDERING WEAK 
DOWNSLOPE FLOW ALONG SMOKIES AND MORE OF A WESTERLY TRACK. REDUCED 
POPS SOME BUT CONFIDENCE STILL RUNNING BELOW AVERAGE...ESPECIALLY 
THROUGH THE LATER HALF OF THE FORECAST. GFS NOW INDICATING REMNANT 
LOW WILL NOT BE PICKED UP BY NORTHERN STREAM AND MAY LINGER IN THE 
LOWER OH VALLEY TROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. THIS WOULD LEAD 
TO ABOVE NORMAL PRECIPITATION CHANCES LATE IN THE WEEKEND INTO NEXT 
WEEK. SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES CONTINUE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE LINGERING OVER THE APPALACHIANS...WITH A 
WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL 
A FAIRLY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY...ALONG WITH 
WEAK MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES. THUS...WILL NOT MENTION ANY CONVECTION 
IN THE FORECAST UNTIL TONIGHT WITH THE APPROACH OF THE WEAK COLD 
FRONT. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY APPROACH THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU TONIGHT...SO WILL MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER THE 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BUT WITH TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD CONTINUES TO BE THE PROGRESSION OF TROPICAL 
STORM/HURRICANE ISAAC...AS IT TRACKS TOWARD THE NORTHERN GULF COAST 
AND EVENTUALLY INLAND DURING THE MIDDLE TO END OF THE WORK WEEK. 
THERE HAS BEEN A HIGH DEGREE OF MODEL VARIABILITY FROM RUN TO 
RUN...WITH ABOUT HALF OF THE ENSEMBLES FAVORING A WESTERLY TRACK 
INTO CENTRAL LOUISIANA AND ARKANSAS AND THE OTHER HALF FAVORING A 
MORE EASTERLY TRACK INTO ALABAMA AND MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THIS HAS LEAD 
TO A FAIRLY COMPLICATED FORECAST...GIVEN THAT THE WESTERLY SOLUTION 
WOULD RESULT IN A DRIER FORECAST FOR THE REGION...WHILE A MORE 
EASTERLY TRACK COULD YIELD SOME HEAVY RAINFALL AND PERHAPS SOME 
FLOODING ISSUES ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

HOWEVER...AS OF EARLY THIS MORNING THERE IS A BIT MORE MODEL 
CONSENSUS MAJOR MODELS AS THE 00Z RUN OF ECMWF HAS FINALLY BEGUN TO 
FAVOR A MORE WESTWARD TRACK LIKE THE GFS...PUSHING ISAAC 
NORTHWESTWARD INTO THE DROUGHT STRICKEN LOWER-MISSISSIPPI/MISSOURI 
RIVER VALLEYS BETWEEN A MID-LATITUDE TROUGH AND A LARGE SUBTROPICAL 
RIDGE. GIVEN THE SIZE OF THE CIRCULATION AND THE DEEP TROPICAL 
MOISTURE THAT WILL ACCOMPANY THE STORM AS IT TRAVELS INLAND... 
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE REGION /PARTICULARLY 
ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SE TENNESSEE WHICH WILL BE CLOSEST 
TO WHERE THE CENTER OF THE STORM MAY PASS/. GIVEN THE MORE WESTERLY 
TRACK FAVORED BY THE MODELS...DID NOT FEEL CONFIDENT GOING HIGHER 
THAN 30-40 POPS WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. SHOULD IT APPEAR THAT THE 
GFS SOLUTION WILL VERIFY...POPS WILL NEED TO BE LOWERED INITIALLY 
DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. HOWEVER...BY THE START OF THE HOLIDAY 
WEEKEND...MODELS ARE SHOWING ANOTHER MID-LATITUDE TROUGH PICKING UP 
THE REMNANTS OF ISAAC AND RAPIDLY PUSHING IT ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY/GREAT LAKES. THUS...THE REGION /PARTICULARLY THE NORTHEASTERN 
ZONES/ COULD SEE ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SOME PRECIPITATION HEADING INTO 
THE LATTER PART OF THE PERIOD. BY THE END OF THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND... 
ISAAC SHOULD BE WELL TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE REGION AS 
GENERALLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT PREVAILS HEADING INTO THE FIRST WEEK OF 
SEPTEMBER. 

OTHERWISE...KEPT TEMPERATURES AT OR SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE GIVEN 
THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER/PRECIPITATION CHANCES. HIGHS WILL GENERALLY 
PEAK IN THE 80-85 DEGREE RANGE...WITH 70S LIKELY IN THE MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SEEING A VERY RANDOM
POPPING UP OF SHRA/TSRA THIS AFTERNOON...AS AIRMASS HAS GOTTEN
SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE WITH TEMPS TOPPING OUT IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S.
DEW POINT TEMPS STILL RUNNING UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. CONVECTION
HAS LASTED INTO THE EARLY EVENING HOURS EACH DAY...SO FELT IT WAS
WISE TO CARRY A TOKEN POP IN A LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING PERIOD
THEN DRY OVERNIGHT. LIMITED ANY FOG TO JUST NEAR THE BODIES OF
WATER OVERNIGHT...AND FAVORED PERSISTENCE ON MINS. 

MONDAY STILL LOOKS MOSTLY DRY...BUT SINCE I CAN'T RULE OUT A STRAY
TSRA IN THE AFTERNOON...I KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS JUST FOR NRN
PLATEAU AND SW VA AREAS. BLEND OF MOS MAXES LOOKED BEST.

NOW FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...WHICH COULD TREND TO MORE DRY
THAN WET...GIVEN THE CONSENSUS BEING REACHED AMONGST MODELS ON THE
TRACK OF ISAAC (MORE WESTERLY). THE MID LEVEL TROUGH AND FRONT LOOK
QUITE WEAK FOR TUESDAY...PLUS THE POSSIBILITY THAT SUBSIDENCE
OCCURS ON THE NNE PERIPHERY OF ISAAC. WITH THIS IN MIND...I KEPT
CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND STAYED AROUND 20-30 PERCENT POPS
FOR NOW. MILDER MOS MINS CHOSEN FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND A BLEND FOR
TUESDAY MAXES...DUE TO AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE 12Z GFS CONTINUED TO 
DRAMATICALLY SHIFT THE TRACK OF ISAAC FARTHER WEST WITH LANDFALL AT 
THIS TIME EXPECTED AROUND 12Z WEDNESDAY IN THE VICINITY OF THE 
MISSISSIPPI OR LOUISIANA COAST. THIS CONTINUES TO BE A NICE PATH FOR 
THE TROPICAL SYSTEM IN TERMS OF OUR FORECAST FOR THE PAST SEVERAL 
DAYS BECAUSE WE HAVE HELD ONTO POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
GENERALLY BETWEEN 30 AND 50 PERCENT FOR THE MAIN IMPACT PERIOD 
ENCOMPASSING WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. ALSO HAD TO RAISE POPS INTO THE 
MEDIUM CHANCE CATEGORY FOR FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND AS THE TROPICAL 
CIRCULATION GETS PICKED UP BY THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH SWINGING THE 
SYSTEM ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND MID SOUTH. ADJUSTED MAX 
TEMPERATURES DOWN A FEW DEGREES TO ACCOUNT FOR AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS 
AND CHANCE FOR RAIN MID WEEK ALONG WITH MODERATING EFFECT OF 
PREVAILING EASTERLY FLOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC REGION... 
WITH A STAGNANT PATTERN OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT 
A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE MID ATLANTIC REGION WILL BRING DRIER 
MID LEVEL AIR OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...ALONG WITH SOME 
SUBSIDENCE ALOFT. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT MOST CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT 
SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...EXCEPT AROUND THE 
MOUNTAINS WHERE ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WITH TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER THAN 
YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IN 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD CONTINUES TO BE THE PROGRESSION OF TROPICAL 
STORM/HURRICANE ISSAC AND WHERE IT WILL TRACK THIS COMING WEEK. THE 
FORECAST HAS BEEN FRUSTRATING TO SAY THE LEAST AS THERE HAS BEEN 
QUITE A BIT OF MODEL VARIABILITY FROM RUN TO RUN AND LITTLE 
CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE MAJOR MODELS. THE MAJOR FACTOR IN WHERE THE 
STORM TRACKS WILL BE A MID-LATITUDE TROUGH...WHICH DEPENDING ON ITS 
TIMING WILL EITHER RECURVE ISSAC FURTHER TO THE NORTH AND EAST...OR 
BYPASS ISSAC AND ALLOW THE STORM TO CONTINUE ON A MORE WESTERLY 
TRACK. 

AS OF EARLY THIS MORNING...THE GFS /WHICH YESTERDAY ATTM HAD AN 
EASTERLY TRACK/ HAS NOW SHIFTED ISSAC MUCH FURTHER TO THE 
WEST...PUSHING THE STORM INTO THE LOUISIANA BAYOUS TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY AND EVENTUALLY INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI/LOWER 
MISSOURI RIVER VALLEYS BY THURSDAY. THE ECMWF...WHICH PREVIOUSLY 
HAD BEEN SHOWING THIS WESTWARD TRACK...HAS NOW SHIFTED TO THE EAST 
AND SHOWS ISSAC MAKING LANDFALL ALONG THE WESTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND MOVING NORTHWARD THROUGH ALABAMA AND EVENTUALLY 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. 

SHOULD THE STORM TAKE THE MORE WESTERLY TRACK SUGGESTED BY THE 
GFS...A SIGNIFICANTLY DRIER FORECAST FOR THE REGION IS LIKELY. 
HOWEVER...SHOULD THE EASTERLY TRACK VERIFY...THE REGION COULD SEE A 
BOUT OF VERY HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING ISSUES...ESPECIALLY ALONG 
THE SPINE OF THE MOUNTAINS. OF PARTICULAR CONCERN WILL BE THE FACT 
THAT A REMNANT FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT IS PROGGED TO PASS THROUGH THE 
AREA MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MAY STALL OUT IN THE VICINITY OF THE 
REGION BY MID-WEEK. THIS WOULD SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR THE DEEP 
MOISTURE THAT WILL STREAM NORTHWARD WITH THE REMNANTS OF 
ISSAC...RESULTING IN SEVERAL ROUNDS OF HEAVY SHOWERS/STORMS AS THE 
SYSTEM GRADUALLY SHIFTS OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. 

GIVEN THE HIGH FORECAST UNCERTAINTY /WITH ALMOST AN EQUAL NUMBER OF 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS FAVORING ONE SOLUTION OR THE OTHER/...HAVE OPTED TO 
SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE FOR NOW. THUS...GENERALLY HAVE FOLLOWED THE 
TRACK/TIMING OF THE NHC FORECAST. HAVE INCREASED POPS TO CHANCE 
AREAWIDE STARTING WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING...GOING 
HIGH-END CHANCE /40-50 PERCENT/ THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. 
HOWEVER...GIVEN THE STILL FAIRLY UNCERTAIN TRACK...DID NOT FEEL 
CONFIDENT GOING HIGHER THAN THAT ATTM. BY THE START OF LABOR DAY 
WEEKEND...A RETURN TO PARTLY SUNNY AND DRIER CONDITIONS CAN BE 
EXPECTED.

PLENTY FOR THE EVENING HOURS TONIGHT. AREAS OF FOG HAVE GENERALLY
BEEN LIMITED OVER THE PAST FEW NIGHTS...SO I TRIMMED BACK THE
COVERAGE AND MENTION SOME FOR TONIGHT. PERSISTENCE ON MIN TEMPS
FAVORS A MOS BLEND OVER THE COOLER PURE GFS MINS.

WEAK UPPER LOW DRIFTS AWAY FROM THE REGION SUNDAY AND THEN THERE
APPEARS TO BE INCREASED SUBSIDENCE OVER THE SRN APPALACHIANS ON
MONDAY AHEAD OF THE TROPICAL SYSTEM ISAAC. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
FOR ERN MTNS SUNDAY AFTERNOON...BUT DROPPED ALL POPS ON MONDAY FOR

NWS GRIDS).

MOS GUIDANCE QUITE CLOSE FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY AND GENERALLY
FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...DID NOT MAKE ANY
MAJOR CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH A SIMILAR SCENARIO FROM
RECENT DAYS FORECASTS.LATEST NATIONAL DEPICTION OF TROPICAL SYSTEM
BRINGS THE FEATURE ONTO THE WESTERN FLORIDA PANHANDLE EARLY
WEDNESDAY MORNING FOLLOWED BY MAJOR LEAGUE DECELERATION AND GRADUAL
WEAKENING INTO THURSDAY. STAYED WITH SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW APPROACHES THROUGH
SOUTHERN ALABAMA. GRADUALLY INCREASE POPS TO MEDIUM AND HIGH CHANCE
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY AS THE INCREASINGLY WEAKENED SURFACE
LOW SHIFTS NORTH TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OF ALABAMA. THE WEAK
REFLECTION OF THE TROPICAL SYSTEM DRIFTS NORTH ACROSS MIDDLE
TENNESSEE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY THE END OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST

350 AM EDT SAT AUG 25 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WITH 
A MORE MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. 
MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS ADDITIONAL MOISTURE WILL HELP TO CREATE A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. WHILE MOST CONVECTION SHOULD INITIATE 
AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...IT APPEARS THAT THERE WILL BE ENOUGH 
OF A NORTHERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW DUE TO A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER 
THE MID ATLANTIC REGION TO PUSH THIS CONVECTION OFF THE MOUNTAINS 
AND INTO THE VALLEYS. THUS...WILL MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION ACROSS 
THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA...WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WITH SLIGHTLY 
COOLER TEMPS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN WHERE THERE SHOULD 
BE A LITTLE MORE CLOUD COVER COMPARED TO YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...FAIR WEATHER WILL CONTINUE INTO 
THE EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS SITUATED 
OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. THIS WILL PROMOTE MOSTLY TO 
PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND CONTINUED WARM TEMPERATURES WITH HIGHS 
PEAKING INTO UPPER 80S TO THE LOWER 90S IN MANY VALLEY LOCATIONS 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY. OTHER THAN AN ISOLATED STORM ALONG THE 
TERRAIN...MOST AREAS WILL REMAIN DRY GIVEN THE WARMER TEMPERATURES 
ALOFT/STRONGER CAP. AN UPPER-TROUGH SWINGING THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE 
REGION....WHICH WILL SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE PLATEAU 
AND MOUNTAINS WHICH HAVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS DURING THIS TIME 
PERIOD/.

AS MENTIONED YESTERDAY...THE BIG WILDCARD IN THE FORECAST CONTINUES 
TO BE TROPICAL STORM/HURRICANE ISSAC AND WHERE EXACTLY IT WILL 
TRACK. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF SHOW THE STORM APPROACHING THE 
ALABAMA/FLORIDA BORDER AROUND 00Z WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...THESE MODEL 
SOLUTIONS HAVE ONCE AGAIN DIVERGED. THE ECMWF PUSHES THE REMNANTS OF 
THIS SYSTEM TOWARD THE DROUGHT STRICKEN LOWER-MISSISSIPPI AND 
LOWER-MISSOURI VALLEYS...WHILE THE GFS NUDGES THE STORM NORTH AND 
EAST THROUGH ALABAMA AND ALONG THE SPINE OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
MOUNTAINS WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY...AND POTENTIALLY INTO FRIDAY IF 
THE FORWARD MOTION SLOWS DOWN. THE ECMWF SOLUTION WOULD LIKELY 
RESULT IN A MUCH DRIER FORECAST FOR THE AREA. HOWEVER...SHOULD AN 
EASTERLY TRACK VERIFY...THE REGION COULD SEE SOME VERY HEAVY 
RAINFALL AND FLOODING IMPACTS OVER A 24-48 HOUR PERIOD BY THE 
MIDDLE TO END OF THE WORK WEEK. THIS WILL PARTICULARLY BE TRUE IF 
THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT STALLS OUT ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND CAN 
FOCUS SOME OF THE ASSOCIATED DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE THAT WILL BE 
PRESENT. FOR NOW...GIVEN THE GREAT DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY BETWEEN THE 
MODELS...DID NOT FEEL COMFORTABLE IN ALTERING POPS A WHOLE LOT IN 
THE EXTENDED. HOWEVER...DID INCREASE POPS TO SOLID CHANCE AREAWIDE 
TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A HEAVY RAIN EVENT NEXT WEEK... 
WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES /40-50 PERCENT/ FAVORING THE MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM...ANOTHER REPEAT CONVECTIVE PERFORMANCE THIS AFTERNOON
WITH SPOTTY TSRA DOTTING THE SPINE OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...
PLUS SOME EARLY DEVELOPMENT OVER THE HIGHER PEAKS IN SW VA. THE
BEST COVERAGE CURRENTLY IS BETWEEN TRI AND MARION VA SOUTHWARD INTO
THE NW CORNER OF WRN NC...WITH A SLOW MOVEMENT S OR SW. THIS
ACTIVITY SHOULD STAY CONFINED THIS EVENING TO AREAS WHERE SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS WERE ALREADY MENTIONED. THUS NO CHANGES FOR TONIGHT'S
GRIDS EXCEPT TO DECREASE THE AREAS WITH PATCHY FOG LATE TONIGHT. 
PERSISTENCE ON MINS FAVORS GFS MOS PLUS A DEGREE OR TWO. 

FOR THE WEEKEND PERIODS...WEAK UPPER LOW CIRCULATION IS SHOWN TO
LINGER OVER NC AND VA...SO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WILL BE KEPT FOR
HIGHER TERRAIN AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS. BY SUNDAY...THE UPPER RIDGE
HAS EASED EASTWARD AND CONVECTION SHOULD BE SUPPRESSED EXCEPT FOR
ERN MOST MTN GROUPS. ALL IN ALL...LITTLE CHANGES NEEDED AT THIS
POINT. MOS TEMPS QUITE CLOSE AND MUCH IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS MAX/MIN
TEMP GRIDS.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...QUITE A BIT OF RIDGING 
AND DRY ADVECTION TO START THE PERIOD SHOULD KEEP RAIN OUT OF THE 
FORECAST BASICALLY UNTIL TUESDAY WHEN AN UPPER TROUGH BUILDS INTO 
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. THE TROUGH WILL DRAG A WEAK AND MOISTURE 
STARVED FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO THE REGION ON TUESDAY. THE GFS AND 
CANADIAN MODELS BRING THE TROPICAL SYSTEM NORTHWARD ACROSS THE 
EASTERN GULF COAST WITH ARRIVAL IN THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE EARLY 
TUESDAY HOWEVER...THE OFFICIAL TPC FORECAST BRINGS THE CIRCULATION 
ON SHORE EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING A LITTLE WEST OF THE GFS/CANADIAN 
TRACKS. TRIED TO STAY A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE OFFICIAL TPC/NCEP 
SYSTEM TRACK WHICH BRINGS A WEAKENED CIRCULATION NORTH ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. IN THIS SCENARIO RAIN CHANCES WILL INCREASE 
TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY FOLLOWED BY DECREASING PROBABILITIES 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE SHIFTS 
FARTHER NORTH TOWARD THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY. MAX TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL DURING THE EARLY PORTION OF THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD BUT WILL DROP BACK CLOSER TO NORMAL WHILE THE FORECAST AREA 
IS IMPACTED BY THE TROPICAL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.

A MORE MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. 
MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS ADDITIONAL MOISTURE WILL HELP TO CREATE A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND ALSO 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION ISOLATED 
CONVECTION FOR THESE AREAS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. OTHERWISE...A 
STAGNANT WEATHER PATTERN SHOULD LINGER FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST BUT WITH 
TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MOSTLY TO PARTLY SUNNY 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THIS WEEKEND INTO THE EARLY PART 
OF THE WORK WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE NOSES ITS WAY INTO THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. GIVEN THE AMPLE SUNSHINE AND HIGHER 
THICKNESS VALUES...TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO PEAK IN THE MID TO 
UPPER 80S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS AND POTENTIALLY TOP OFF IN THE 
LOWER 90S ACROSS PORTIONS OF SE TENNESSEE. ASIDE FROM SOME ISOLATED 
LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND 
PLATEAU...DRY CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST FOR MOST LOCATIONS ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. HOWEVER...AN UPPER-TROUGH SWINGING THROUGH THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY IS EXPECTED TO PUSH A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE 
REGION...WHICH WOULD SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.

THE MAJOR WILDCARD IN THE FORECAST HEADING INTO LATTER HALF OF THE 
PERIOD WILL BE TROPICAL STORM/HURRICANE ISSAC AND WHERE EXACTLY IT 
WILL TRACK. MODELS HAVE BEEN A BIT ALL OVER THE MAP IN THE PAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS...BUT THE 00Z RUNS OF THE GFS AND ECMWF BOTH PLACE 
THE SYSTEM ROUGHLY OFF OF THE ALABAMA GULF COAST TUESDAY MORNING AND 
SHOW IT PROGRESSING NORTHWARD INTO MIDDLE/EAST TENNESSEE BY A 
WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY TIMEFRAME...BEFORE EXITING THE REGION INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY BY FRIDAY. SHOULD THIS OCCUR...THE POTENTIAL FOR VERY 
HEAVY RAINFALL WILL EXIST ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA 
/PARTICULARLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS IF THE 
EASTERLY GFS SOLUTION PREVAILS/. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE RECENT 
PERFORMANCE OF THE MODELS...DO NOT HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE TO GO 
HIGHER THAN A 30 POP FOR DAYS 6 AND 7 AS A GREAT DEAL OF 
UNCERTAINTY EXISTS WITH THE TRACK/TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM. FOR 
NOW...WILL CONTINUE TO WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL CONTINUITY BEFORE 
MAKING ANY FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SPOTTY CONVECTION IS
DEVELOPING AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON JUST ABOUT IN THE SAME AREAS AS
YESTERDAY...GENERALLY ALONG OR JUST EAST OF THE TN-NC LINE. FAIR
WEATHER CUMULUS ACROSS HIGHER TERRAIN AND LOTS OF SUNSHINE
ELSEWHERE. OPTED TO KEEP THOSE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING INTO THE
EARLY EVENING ACROSS THE EXTREME ERN AREAS. PATCHY AREAS OF FOG
FORMED AGAIN LAST NIGHT OVER A FEW SPOTS OF THE NRN AND CENTRAL
VALLEYS AS WELL AS IN MURPHY NC AREA...SO I ADDED PATCHY FOG AGAIN
FOR THOSE LOCATIONS. TRENDED A LITTLE CLOSER TO MOS BLEND FOR LOWS. 

UPPER RIDGING SEEMS TO NUDGE EAST SOME FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...
WITH RAIN CHANCES STAYING VERY SLIM AND MAINLY FOR THE HIGHER
TERRAIN IN THE EAST. SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST OR NORTHEAST BY
SATURDAY WHICH MIGHT PRODUCE MORE SE LOW LEVEL FLOW...SUPPORTING
OUR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AGAIN IN THE EASTERN AREAS. ADDED A FEW
PIXCELS OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NRN PLATEAU ON SATURDAY...BUT
NOT ENOUGH TO BE REFLECTED IN ZFPMRX PRODUCT YET. 

OTHERWISE...12Z MOS TEMPS WERE CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS AND
GENERALLY FOLLOWED WITH A SLIGHT PREFERENCE FOR GFS NUMBERS.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE FORECAST SHOULD 
REMAIN BASICALLY DRY DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE LONG TERM AS AN 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TRIES TO BRING A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY TOWARD THE 
REGION FROM THE WEST AND TROPICAL STORM ISAAC SLOWLY APPROACHES THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. FROM THE CARIBBEAN. STAYED WITH ISOLATED 
CONVECTION IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER 
OVER THE WEEKEND WITH INCREASING POPS MONDAY NIGHT INTO MID WEEK AS 
THE TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVES NORTH THROUGH THE EASTERN GULF OF MEXICO. 
OF COURSE...THIS SYSTEM HAS A LONG WAY TO GO AND FORECAST TRACK IS 
UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT. AN EASTERN ROUTE WOULD MEAN LOWER 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIP AND A RATHER TIGHT QPF GRADIENT AS EASTERLY 
FLOW PRODUCES RAIN ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN ON THE NC/TN BORDER
WITH ADIABATIC WARMING AND DRYING ACROSS MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. WILL HAVE TO WAIT A LITTLE LONGER FOR BETTER 
RESOLUTION ON SYSTEM TRACK. STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO GUIDANCE 
TEMPERATURES EARLY IN THE PERIOD BUT ADJUSTED MAXES DOWN A FEW 
DEGREES WHILE PULLING MINS A LITTLE HIGHER LATE.

ENE AWAY FROM OUR FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...WILL CARRY THOSE SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS THRU 23/00Z FOR NE MTNS AND HAVE A PRE-FIRST PERIOD 
THERE. 

WEATHER FOR TONIGHT IS UNEVENTFUL...EXCEPT FOR SOME PATCHY FOG OR 
LOW CLOUDS ACROSS THE NRN AND CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES PLUS MURPHY 
AREA OF CHEROKEE COUNTY NC. TRENDED MINS A BIT CLOSER TO THE COOLER 
GFS MOS MIN TEMPS. MY MIN TEMP FORECAST WILL BE AT LEAST 4 DEGREES

CUMULUS SHOULD APPROACH SCATTERED IN NUMBER IN THE AFTERNOON OVER 
THE PLATEAU AND OTHER HIGHER TERRAIN...SIMILAR TO TODAY. MOS MAXES 
SIMILAR AND QUITE CLOSE TO PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID. 

OTHERWISE...GOOD CONTINUITY KEPT FOR THURSDAY NIGHT (DRY) AND FRIDAY 
(SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FAR ERN AREAS IN THE AFTERNOON). ANY CONVECTION 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON WOULD STILL BE MOVING IN AN EASTERLY DIRECTION AWAY 
FROM THE FOOTHILLS AND VALLEYS. STUCK VERY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS MIN/MAX 
TEMP GRIDS.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS 
IN CONTROL OVER THE AREA PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

POSSIBLE EACH DAY ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...PRIMARILY OVER THE 
MOUNTAINS AND MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. INSTABILITY 
INCREASES ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY AHEAD A TROUGH 
SO COULD SEE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AREA WIDE ON MONDAY. 
A BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO ENTER THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.

TEMPERATURES THAN YESTERDAY...AS THE MERCURY HAS ALREADY CLIMBED
INTO THE LOW TO MID 80S ACROSS MANY VALLEY LOCATIONS AS OF 3 PM

RIVER VALLEY SOME LIGHT/MODERATE SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED IN RESPONCE
TO AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH THAT WILL PASS OVER THE REGION
LATER THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE LATER TIMING OF THIS

EXPECTING MUCH DEVELOPMENT ACROSS OUR AREA THIS EVENING /THOUGH A
ROGUE SHOWER OR TWO COULD DEVELOP ALONG THE SPINE OF THE MOUNTAINS
AND SW VIRGINIA/ DURING THE LATER AFTERNOON AND EVENING/.

TONIGHT...THE COMBINATION OF A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY AND RELATIVELY CALM
CONDITIONS WILL ONCE AGAIN RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL FOR PATCHY FOG
IN THE VICINITY OF AREA LAKES AGAIN. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE HIGHER
DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS/LOWER RH VALUES EXPECTED ELSEWHERE...AM
EXPECTING THIS FOG TO REMAIN CONFINED TO LOCATIONS NEAR BODIES OF

TOMORROW RESULTING IN ANOTHER NEAR PICTURE PERFECT DAY...WITH

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TOMORROW/...
A BEAUTIFUL LATE SUMMER DAY IS ONGOING ACROSS THE REGION THIS
AFTERNOON AS MORNING FOG/CLOUD COVER HAS GIVEN WAY TO MOSTLY SUNNY
CONDITIONS. MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING...MAINLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE SPINE OF THE TN/NC
MOUNTAINS AND SW VIRGINIA. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE FACT THAT ANY
ACTIVITY THAT TRIED TO INITIATE SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON HAS REALLY
STRUGGLED TO MAINTAIN ITSELF...AM THINKING ANY DEVELOPMENT SHOULD
BE FAIRLY SPOTTY AND ISOLATED IN NATURE. WITH ANY SHOWER ACTIVITY
DYING OFF AFTER SUNSET...GENERALLY MOSTLY CLEAR/PARTLY CLOUDY
CONDITIONS AND LIGHT WINDS ARE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT. WITH THE DRIER
AIR THAT HAS FILTERED INTO THE REGION...MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE NOT
INDICATING THE SAME DENSE FOG POTENTIAL AS WHAT HAS IN THE PAST
COUPLE OF NIGHTS. HOWEVER...GIVEN THAT FOG DEVELOPMENT NEAR AREA
LAKES WILL BE GETTING MORE COMMON HEADING INTO LATE SUMMER/EARLY
FALL...HAVE OPTED TO MAINTAIN A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG NEAR BODIES
OF WATER AND IN SHELTERED VALLEY LOCATIONS WHERE WINDS MAY
COMPLETELY DECOUPLE AFTER MIDNIGHT.


FOR TOMORROW...ANOTHER SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS/ISOLATED STORMS
WILL EXIST ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEASTERN ZONES AS ANOTHER
UPPER-TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS THE REGION DURING THE AFTERNOON.
HOWEVER...MOST LOCATIONS SHOULD REMAIN DRY AS A BULK OF THIS
ACTIVITY WILL REMAIN CONFINED TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN. THIS WILL
RESULT IN ANOTHER PLEASANT DAY WITH MOSTLY TO PARTY SUNNY
CONDITIONS AND AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES PERHAPS READING A DEGREE OR
TWO WARMER THAN TODAY.

.LONG TERM /TOMORROW NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
A DEEP RIDGE WILL BE MOVING INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST AT THE
BEGINNING OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD...AND REMAIN OVER THE REGION
THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE PERIOD. WITH THE INFLUENCE OF THE
RIDGE...A PERSISTENCE FORECAST OF DRY CONDITIONS WITH TEMPERATURES
NEAR NORMAL WILL BE FOLLOWED. THE 12Z CANADIAN MODEL IS THE OUTLIER
IN THIS PATTERN...SHOWING A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER
THE TN VALLEY ON SATURDAY. THE DRY GFS AND ECMWF SOLUTIONS HAVE
SHOWN BETTER CONSISTENCY AND ARE PREFERRED. THERE WILL BE A SLIGHT
WARMING TREND THROUGH THE END OF THIS WEEK AS THE CENTER OF THE
RIDGE SLOWLY SHIFTS TO OUR EAST. A SLIGHT INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE IS EXPECTED BY SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW
DEVELOPS...BUT THIS SHOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT OTHER THAN SLIGHTLY
HIGHER NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURES AS THE MID-UPPER RIDGE REMAINS
OVERHEAD.

FEW CHANGES NEEDED TO THE FORECAST AS VALLEY FOG HAS GENERALLY
DISSIPATED WITH SOLAR HEATING TAKING PLACE THIS MORNING. THE BROAD
AREA OF MID-LEVEL CLOUDS THAT APPEARED TO BE MOVING INTO THE AREA
FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE HAVE BROKEN UP SIGNIFICANTLY OVER THE PAST

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...MAIN CONCERN IS 
AREA/PATCHY DENSE FOG THIS MORNING.  THE GREATEST COVERAGE OF DENSE 
FOG WILL BE EAST OF INTERSTATE 75 SINCE THE DRIER AIR TO OUR WEST 
HAS NOT MOVED INTO THE EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
ALSO...SCATTERED SHOWERS MOVED THROUGH THESE AREAS THIS SUNDAY 
EVENING. HAVE INCLUDED AREAS OF DENSE FOG EAST...PATCHY WEST FOR 
THIS MORNING. WILL MONITOR DEVELOPMENT OF THE FOG FOR POSSIBLE 
ADVISORY.

UPPER TROUGH IS MOVING SLOWLY ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS 
BUT AXIS OF MOISTURE HAS ALREADY MOVED TO THE EAST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. PWS DECREASE TO LESS THAN ONE INCH WITH LITTLE TO NO CAPE...SO 
MAINLY A DRY FORECAST FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS.

FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY NIGHT...STEAM FOG DEVELOPMENT IS 
ANTICIPATED SO HAVE INCLUDED FOG NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING IN EARLY IN THE EXTENDED WILL ALLOW FOR A WARMING TREND AND 
DRY CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  WILL REMAIN GENERALLY 
BETWEEN SYSTEMS THROUGH THE REST OF THE PERIOD...BUT WITH WARMER 
TEMPERATURES HELPING TO WEAKLY DESTABILIZED THE ATMOSPHERE...COULD 
SEE DIURNAL CONVECTION DEVELOP FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY.  BEST CHANCES 
WILL BE OVER HIGHER TERRAIN...ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE TIME FRAME.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS TWO WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREAS OVER THE 
UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND NORTHERN GA...WITH A SURFACE TROUGH IN 
BETWEEN KEEPING DEWPOINTS FAIRLY HIGH OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
(COMPARED TO AREAS FARTHER WEST AND NORTH OVER MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL

EXIST ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND AGAIN ALONG
THE MOUNTAINS ON TUESDAY AS THE BASE OF THE TROUGH PUSHES OVER THE

ALMOST NO QPF SIGNALS ON TUESDAY/. HOWEVER...BASED ON THE POOR
PERFORMANCE OF THE MODELS OF LATE...AND THE ENHANCED LIFT...FELT
THAT SLIGHT CHANCES POPS WERE CERTAINLY WARRANTED DURING THIS TIME
FRAME. THEREAFTER...SLIGHTLY WARMER AND DRIER CONDITIONS WILL EXIST
FOR THE SECOND HALF OF THE WORK WEEK AS THE AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH
EXITS THE REGION AND A SURFACE HIGH BEGINS TO BUILD IN. THIS WILL
RESULT IN MOSTLY/PARTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS AND WARMER TEMPERATURES AS

SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY EXIST ONCE AGAIN AS A SERIES OF

MAIN EFFECTS NEAR THE NORTH CAROLINA STATE-LINE. FRONTO-GENETIC 
FORCING IS HELPING TO PRODUCE AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A 
THUNDERSTORM OVER SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THIS

CHANCES OF RAIN OVER THE EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

THE MAIN WEATHER FEATURES WILL BE AN UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE OHIO

OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AT THE SURFACE/BOUNDARY LAYER...AN 
INVERTED TROUGH WILL BE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...AND THEN

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK WARM FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE 
SOUTHERN TN BORDER...EXTENDING FROM AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER SOUTHERN AR. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF 
HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE MS AND TN RIVER VALLEYS...ASSOCIATED WITH A 
LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
THIS BROAD UPPER TROUGH IS PROGGED TO DEEPEN OVERNIGHT AND INTO 
SUNDAY...WHICH WILL HELP TO PUSH THE LOW PRESSURE AREA AND WARM 
FRONT NORTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...A FEW SHOWERS 
SHOULD DEVELOP OVERNIGHT MAINLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR 
THE MOST PART...BUT WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO BE MORE PESSIMISTIC 
WITH THE CLOUD COVER. WILL NOT PLAN TO MENTION ANY FOG OVERNIGHT DUE 
TO THIS EXTENSIVE AREA OF HIGH CLOUDS.

.AVIATION...A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVELENGTH FEATURES WILL BUILD
THROUGH THE REGION DEEPENING THE PERSISTENT EASTERN STATES LONG
WAVE TROUGH. THE FIRST SHORT WAVE IS MOVING ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN
U.S. WITH BEST LIFT AND DEEPEST MOISTURE SOUTH OF A FRONTAL
BOUNDARY DRAPED NEAR THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE BORDER. THE WAVE WILL
TRY TO ENCOURAGE THE BOUNDARY NORTH INTO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE LATER
TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING WITH A CHANCE FOR A COUPLE SHOWERS
AROUND CHA LATER TONIGHT INTO DAYBREAK. FARTHER NORTH ISENTROPIC
LIFT WILL BRING SOME HIGH BASED SCT-BKN SC AND BKN AC TO TYS AND
TRI BUT NOT SURE IF LIFT AND MOISTURE WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR THE
PRODUCTION OF SHOWERS AT A HIGH ENOUGH PROBABILITY TO INCLUDE IN
THE TAF. THEREFORE...KEPT PRECIP OUT OF THESE TERMINALS AT THIS
TIME. BELIEVE THERE WILL BE ENOUGH CLOUDS AROUND TO INHIBIT DECENT
FOG FORMATION OVERNIGHT BUT IF IT OCCURS...IT WILL MOST LIKELY
HAPPEN AT TRI WHERE I PLACED A TOKEN VFR CATEGORY VISIBILITY
RESTRICTION. WITH SHORT WAVE EXITING THE REGION BY MID DAY SUNDAY
STAYED WITH VFR FLIGHT WEATHER FOR THE DAYTIME PORTION OF THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER 
THE REGION...AND MODELS HAVE BEEN HAVING A HARD TIME HANDLING PIECES 
OF WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING THROUGH...WHICH LEADS TO A LOWER 
THAN USUAL FORECAST CONFIDENCE EVEN FOR THE SHORT TERM.  APPEARS 
SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MAY BRUSH SOUTHERN AREAS TONIGHT...SO 
WILL INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SOME SHOWERS LATER TONIGHT 
ACROSS SOUTHERN ZONES.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES FOR 
SUNDAY AS THERE SHOULD BE SOME MODEST INSTABILITY PRESENT.  MAV 
TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL SO JUST A FEW TWEAKS FOR THE SHORT 
TERM PERIOD.  

.LONG TERM.../SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/... A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL
STORM SYSTEM OVER EASTERN CANADA WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT WEATHER
FEATURE ACROSS THE EASTERN CONUS EARLY THIS WEEK. ALTHOUGH THE
FRONT WILL REMAIN DISPLACED SOUTH OF THE REGION... MODELS HAVE
CONTINUED TO TREND WETTER TOMORROW NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS AN AREA OF
LOW PRESSURE SLIDES NORTHEASTWARD ALONG THE SPINE OF THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. THIS WILL RESULT IN REASONABLE CHANCE POPS
ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN ZONES DURING
THIS TIME PERIOD AS MODELS HAVE ALL BEGUN TO TREND THIS
WAY...SHOWING APPRECIABLE QPF SIGNALS /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE
EASTERN AND FAR SOUTHERN ZONES/. THIS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL
DEPART THE REGION BY TUESDAY MORNING AS THE BASE OF THE TROUGH
SWINGS ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE.

THEREAFTER...FAIR/DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED FOR MUCH OF THE REMAINDER 
OF THE WORK WEEK AS SURFACE RIDGING BUILDS IN...PROMOTING 
MOSTLY/PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND A GRADUAL WARMING TREND AS HIGHS 
RETURN TO THE LOW TO UPPER 80S ACROSS MOST AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. LATE IN THE PERIOD...MODELS ARE STARTING TO COME 
INTO BETTER AGREEMENT ON AN UPPER-TROUGH SWINGING THROUGH THE GREAT 
LAKES/OHIO VALLEY...WHICH MAY GIVE THE AREA ANOTHER SHOT OF 
PRECIPITATION LATE IN THE WEEK. HAVE INCLUDED LOW-END MENTIONABLE 
POPS AREAWIDE FOR NOW /WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES FAVORING THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN/. THE BEST CHANCES FOR STORMS MAY BE SATURDAY AS THIS TROUGH 
PASSES OVER THE REGION...BUT WILL TAKE A CAUTIOUS APPROACH ON POPS 
FOR NOW GIVEN THAT THIS SYSTEM IS STILL A WEEK OUT.

.SHORT TERM.../TODAY AND SATURDAY/...A COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO
MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THROUGH THE EVENING. CLOUD COVER
FROM THE OVERNIGHT MCS HAS LIMITED AFTERNOON HEATING. WITH SMALL
AMOUNTS OF INSTABILITY AND DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S...CAN EXPECT
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT
HOURS. THESE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL LESSEN IN INTENSITY AND
COVERAGE APPROACHING 12Z. FRONT MOVES EAST OF THE AREA LATE MORNING
WITH CLOUD COVERAGE DECREASING THROUGHOUT THE DAY.

.LONG TERM.../TOMORROW NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/... IN WAKE OF THE
COLD FRONT THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION TONIGHT INTO
TOMORROW...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BEGIN TO WANE HEADING INTO
EARLY NEXT WEEK. HAVE CONTINUED THE TREND OF SCALING BACK POPS
SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE REGION AS THE NAM-12 HAS COME IN LINE WITH
THE GFS/SREF SOLUTIONS OF PUSHING THE FRONT THROUGH THE ENTIRE AREA
BY TOMORROW. AS A RESULT...HAVE TAKEN OUT ALL MENTIONABLE POPS
TOMORROW NIGHT...AND HAVE KEPT ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS ALONG
THE MOUNTAIN ZONES FOR ANY ISOLATED OROGRAPHIC AIDED DIURNAL
CONVECTION THAT COULD DEVELOP SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. ON
MONDAY...ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG STORM
SYSTEM ROTATING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL DROP ACROSS THE REGION.
THIS WILL DRIVE ANOTHER WEAK FRONT THROUGH THE AREA...WHICH MAY
TRIGGER OFF SOME ISOLATED STORMS...PRIMARILY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE
MOUNTAINS AND THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES /WHERE THE LOW-END MENTIONABLE
POPS EXIST ATTM/.

IN ADDITION...AN EARLY AUTUMN AIR MASS WILL FILTER BACK INTO THE 
REGION AS MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED THROUGH MOST OF THE WORK WEEK. THE MOST 
NOTABLE CHANGE MAY BE WITH LOW TEMPERATURES...WHICH WILL STRUGGLE TO 
REMAIN ABOVE 60 DEGREES OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN URBAN AREAS DURING THE 
OVERNIGHT PERIODS LATE THIS WEEKEND INTO THE EARLY PART OF THE WORK 
WEEK...BEFORE GRADUALLY WARMING TO MORE SEASONABLE LEVELS BY THE END 
OF THE PERIOD. HIGHS WILL GENERALLY REACH THE UPPER 70S TO MID 
80S...WITH SOME UPPER 80S CREEPING BACK IN BY WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY. 
LATE IN THE WORK WEEK...MODEL THINKING DIFFERS WITH THE TIMING/TRACK 
OF AN UPPER-TROUGH PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE NORTHERN CONUS. THE 
ECMWF IS MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH THIS FEATURE AND SHOWS A FAIRLY 
GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WHILE THE 
GFS SUPPORTS ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND SURFACE RIDGING BUILDING IN. FOR 
NOW...HAVE KEPT POPS AT LOW-END MENTIONABLE LEVELS LATE IN THE WORK 
WEEK AND WILL WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL CONTINUITY WITH REGARD TO THIS 
PART OF THE FORECAST.

JET WHICH WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA.

WILL PLAN FOR LIKELY TO CAT POPS AREA-WIDE. SOME OF THE STORMS COULD 
BE STRONG TO SEVERE WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING STRONG WINDS...HEAVY
RAINS...AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING.

THE STORMS WILL WEAKEN THIS EVENING AND DISSIPATE DUE TO THE LOSS OF 
DAYTIME HEATING. PLAN ON FOLLOWING MOS NUMBER CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL LINGER OVER THE AREA ON SATURDAY AS A COLD FRONT 
PULL AWAY FROM THE REGION.  A SLIGHT CHANCE OF CONVECTION WILL 
CONTINUE INTO SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH THE FRONT STRETCHED TO OUR 
SOUTH AND EAST AND A COUPLE OF WEAK IMPULSE MOVING THOUGH.  SURFACE 
HIGH BUILDS IN FOR DRY CONDITIONS ON TUESDAY.  DIURNAL CONVECTION 
POSSIBLE OVER HIGHER ELEVATION ON WEDNESDAY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE ON 
CONVECTION ACROSS THE MRX CWA ON THURSDAY.

256 PM EDT THU AUG 16 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
SHIFT EAST AS A COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO THE AREA.  MOISTURE WILL 
INCREASE AHEAD OF THE FRONT...BUT LOOKS LIKE PRECIP SHOULD MOSTLY 
HOLD OFF UNTIL FRIDAY.  WILL JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS PLATEAU 
LATE TONIGHT...THEN LIKELY POPS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON.  WHILE THERE 
ARE STILL QUESTIONS ABOUT HOW MUCH CONVECTIVE ENERGY WILL BE 
AVAILABLE...SOME SEVERE STORMS STILL LOOK POSSIBLE SO WILL LEAVE 
MENTION IN HWO.  GENERALLY LEANED TOWARD A MET/MAV BLEND FOR TEMPS 
TONIGHT BUT STAYED MORE WITH THE HIGHER MAV NUMBERS FOR HIGHS 
FRIDAY.  

.LONG TERM.../FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/... FRIDAY NIGHT INTO
THE WEEKEND...MODELS DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY WITH THE POSITION OF A
COLD FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA EARLIER ON FRIDAY. THE
GFS/SREF SOLUTIONS ARE FAR MORE BULLISH WITH THE FRONT AND SHOW IT
CLEARING THE ENTIRE AREA BY LATE FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING. THE
NAM-12 IS CONTINUING TO HINT AT A MUCH SLOWER PROGRESSION OF THE
FRONT...AND SHOWS IT HANGING UP ROUGHLY ALONG THE I-40/I-81
CORRIDOR THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEKEND. THIS WOULD RESULT IN A
SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT FORECAST REGARDING PRECIPITATION AS FAIRLY
REASONABLE CHANCES FOR CONTINUED SHOWERS AND STORMS WOULD BE
PRESENT /PARTICULARLY ON SUNDAY/ SHOULD THIS SOLUTION VERIFY. THIS
IS A STARK CONTRAST TO THE GFS/SREF MODELS WHICH ARE MUCH DRIER AND
SHOW ANY CONVECTIVE SIGNALS HUGGING THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE SMOKY
MTNS AND FURTHER TO THE SOUTH ALONG THE FRONT IN NORTHERN
ALABAMA/GEORGIA. GIVEN THIS UNCERTAINTY...HAVE MAINTAINED A MODEL
SPLIT FOR NOW...AND HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW-END CHANCE POPS
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH THE HIGHEST
POPS FAVORING SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN ZONES.
THE BEST POTENTIAL FOR ANY SEVERE WEATHER SHOULD BE DURING THE DAY
ON FRIDAY /WHEN THE BEST INSTABILITY PARAMETERS WILL COMBINE WITH
THE PASSAGE OF A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND THE EVENTUAL COLD FRONT
LATER IN THE EVENING/. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE HIGH PWAT VALUES IN
PLACE ACROSS THE REGION...LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL WILL CERTAINLY
BE A CONCERN WITH ANY ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP THIS WEEKEND.

THEREAFTER...A COOL/DRY...EARLY AUTUMN AIR MASS WILL FILTER BACK 
INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL PROMOTE MOSTLY/PARTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS 
AND COOLER HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 70S/LOWER 80S EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...BEFORE A GRADUAL WARMING TREND OCCURS AS A SURFACE HIGH 
BUILDS BACK IN. THE MOST NOTABLE CHANGE MAY BE WITH LOW 
TEMPERATURES...WHICH WILL STRUGGLE TO REMAIN ABOVE 60 DEGREES 
OUTSIDE OF THE MAIN URBAN AREAS DURING THE OVERNIGHT PERIODS. LATE 
IN THE PERIOD...MODEL THINKING DIFFERS WITH THE TIMING/TRACK OF AN 
UPPER-TROUGH PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE NORTHEAST CONUS. FOR 
NOW...HAVE KEPT POPS AT LOW-END MENTIONABLE LEVELS LATE IN THE WORK 
WEEK AND WILL WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL CONTINUITY WITH REGARD TO THIS 
SYSTEM.

AROUND TODAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE LINGERING WITH RELATIVELY DRY AIR IN 
PLACE. HOWEVER...THERE MAY BE SOME AREAS OF FOG EARLY WITH MOIST 
SURFACE CONDITIONS DUE TO WEDNESDAY RAINFALL. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A 
FEW DEGREES WARMER TODAY WITH MORE INSOLATION. NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM

A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TOWARD DAYBREAK. STAYED RATHER CLOSE TO GUIDANCE 
BLEND FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE TN VALLEY REGION WILL BE 
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A LONGWAVE TROUGH THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. THE 
BEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE ON FRIDAY AS HEIGHTS FALL AHEAD OF THE 
DEEPENING TROUGH AND THE UPPER JET MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY POPS ON 
FRIDAY...WITH HIGHEST POPS NORTH CLOSER TO THE UPPER JET. 
INSTABILITY APPEARS MARGINAL...BUT SHOULD SUFFICIENT FOR A FEW 
ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS WHEN COMBINED WITH UPPER LEVEL FORCING. THE 
SURFACE COLD FRONT PUSHES IN FRIDAY NIGHT...AND A DRIER AIR MASS 
BEGINS TO BUILD IN FROM THE NORTHWEST. 

THE NAM AND GFS DIFFER ON THE POSITION OF THE FRONT BY 
SATURDAY...WITH THE GFS PUSHING IT FARTHER SOUTH...WHILE THE NAM 
HANGS UP THE FRONT ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. THE GFS SOLUTION APPEARS TO 
HAVE SUPPORT FROM THE SREF AND CANADIAN...SO WILL JUST HAVE A LOW 
CHANCE POP IN EXTREME SOUTHERN AND EASTERN ZONES FOR SATURDAY. ON 
SUNDAY BOTH THE NAM AND GFS SHOW A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING THROUGH 
THE LARGER TROUGH...SO WILL EXPAND THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS FARTHER 
NORTH AND WEST...BUT STILL JUST A SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POP AS 
MOISTURE APPEARS LIMITED. A CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT PERSISTS THROUGH THE 
EARLY WORK WEEK...WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN THE LOW LEVELS. 
THIS SHOULD GIVE A DRY FORECAST WITH TEMPS BELOW NORMAL FOR MONDAY

330 AM EDT WED AUG 15 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL BUILD 
EAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH EARLY TODAY BRINGING THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
SHOWER TO THE AREA. RADARS SHOW SOME LIGHT SHOWERS DEVELOPING ACROSS 
CENTRAL KENTUCKY AND NORTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE AT THIS HOUR IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH THIS FEATURE. THE TROUGH AXIS SHOULD MOVE TOWARD 
THE APPALACHIANS BY MID DAY BRINGING AN END TO RAIN CHANCES FOR MUCH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...LEFT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION 
IN THE FORECAST ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS DURING THE EARLY AFTERNOON. 
DRIER AIR SHOULD FILTER INTO THE REGION FOR A QUIET OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD. STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR TEMPERATURES IN 
THE SHORT TERM.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A LONGWAVE TROUGH PATTERN 
WILL BE DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN CONUS BEGINNING LATE 
THURSDAY...AND PERSIST THROUGH THE REST OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. 
THURSDAY WILL BE DRY BEHIND A DEPARTING RIDGE...WITH CHANCE POPS 
COMING THURSDAY NIGHT WITH THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER JET AND TROUGH. 
BEST LIFT IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET AND GOOD INSTABILITY 
WILL BE FRIDAY AFTERNOON...WITH POPS RISING INTO THE LIKELY RANGE. 
THE SURFACE COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH 
CHANCE POPS GRADUALLY LOWERING FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT 
AS DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR BUILDS INTO THE AREA.

THE WEEKEND FORECAST WILL DEPEND ON WHERE THE FRONT STALLS. 
THE MODEL CONSENSUS INDICATES THAT THE FRONT WILL BE NEAR OUR 
SOUTHERN BORDER ON SATURDAY...SO WILL KEEP A LOW CHANCE POP GOING 
THERE WITH A DRY FORECAST NORTH. THIS SAME PATTERN LINGERS INTO 
SUNDAY. THE BROAD TROUGH ALOFT BECOMES A BIT MORE AMPLIFIED ON 
MONDAY...WHICH PUSHES THE UPPER JET AND SURFACE FRONT FARTHER TO OUR 
SOUTH AND EAST...RESULTING IN A DRY FORECAST FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY 
WITH TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL.

SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING GENERATING SOME LIGHT TO
MODERATE SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME THUNDER EARLIER. THE PRECIP LINED UP
ALONG A WEST THROUGH EAST PATH ACROSS CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE
AFFECTING TYS. BELIEVE THIS IS THE BEST SHOT AT HAVING SOME PRECIP
AT A TERMINAL THROUGH MUCH OF THE MORNING. THERE ARE EVEN A FEW IFR
CEILINGS AROUND IMPACTING CHA WITH SOME NEAR LIFR CEILINGS POSSIBLE
AT TYS WHERE LIGHT RAIN IS OCCURRING. WOULD EXPECT THESE POOR
FLIGHT CONDITIONS TO IMPROVE AROUND 14Z AND BEYOND. APPLIED SOME
VICINITY THUNDER AT THE TERMINALS TODAY WITH YET ANOTHER UPPER WAVE
OR TWO TO PASS OVER THE REGION ALONG WITH A WEAK SURFACE COOL FRONT.
FORECAST SOME MVFR FOG AT TYS LATE TONIGHT WITH MVFR CONDITIONS
DETERIORATING TO IFR VARIETY AT TRI IN VSBY WITH AN LIFR CEILING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...A LONGWAVE TROUGH WILL 
BE OVER THE EASTERN CONUS TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH A SERIES OF 
SHORTWAVES PASSING BY OUR AREA. CONVECTION THIS MORNING IS FOCUSED 
TO OUR SOUTH AHEAD OF A SHORTWAVE TROUGH. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE 
NOW IN MIDDLE TN...AND COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE THROUGH THE 
DAY WITH DESTABILIZATION AND THE PASSAGE OF THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE HIGH INSTABILITY SHOWN BY THE 
NAM SEEMS OVERDONE...BUT THE GFS STILL SHOWS AFTERNOON CAPE VALUES 
IN THE 1500 J/KG RANGE...SO AN ISOLATED SEVERE THREAT CANNOT BE 
RULED OUT. CHANCE POPS WILL CONTINUE INTO TONIGHT AS THE MODELS SHOW 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSING THE AREA...BUT WITH LESS 
INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE TO WORK WITH. 

THE TROUGH AXIS MOVES TO OUR EAST BY 12Z WED...AND A RIDGE BUILDS 
OVER THE AREA. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES ARE EXPECTED WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH HIGHS IN THE 80S AND LOWS IN THE UPPER 50S TO 
MID 60S. AS A TROUGH MOVES FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO THE GREAT 
LAKES...THE RIDGE BECOMES SUPPRESSED. A MORE SOUTHWESTERLY LOW LEVEL 
FLOW DEVELOPS...BRINGING HIGHS ON THURSDAY INTO THE UPPER 80S AND 
LOWER 90S IN MOST SPOTS. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE THURSDAY 
NIGHT AHEAD OF THIS TROUGH...WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP COMING IN LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT TO WESTERN SECTIONS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...ANOTHER LONG WAVE TROUGH 
AMPLIFIES AS IT BUILDS SLOWLY EAST INTO THE EASTERN PORTION OF THE 
NATION OVER THE WEEKEND. MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF 
ASSOCIATED COOL FRONT MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATER FRIDAY 
NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL BE ON THE 
INCREASE AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT SO HELD ONTO 
HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE 
EXTENDED. ALSO MAINTAINED SOME SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON SATURDAY DUE TO POSSIBLE SLOWER FRONTAL 
MOVEMENT. DID NOT WANT TO STRAY AWAY FROM THE SLIGHT CHANCE 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIP FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY AS MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW UPPER TROUGH HOLDING ITS EASTERN 
U.S. POSITION WITH A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY CONTINUING 
TO ROTATE THROUGH THE LONG WAVE FEATURE ACROSS THIS PART OF THE 
COUNTRY. ALSO...MEX MOS GUIDANCE POPS CONTINUE TO HANG IN THERE WITH

LINGERING SHOWER ACTIVITY FROM A DECAYING LINE THAT MOVED THROUGH
THE REGION EARLIER THIS AFTERNOON IS TAPERING OFF ACROSS THE MTNS
OF NE TENNESSEE. SOME ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE BEGUN TO
DEVELOP ACROSS THE NORTHWEST ZONES WHICH WILL DRIFT ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY DURING THE LATE EVENING...WARRANTING CHANCE POPS
AREAWIDE THROUGH 06Z. A COLD FRONT ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE WILL
THEN SWEEP EASTWARD INTO MIDDLE AND EVENTUALLY THE EASTERN PART OF
THE VOLUNTEER STATE LATE TONIGHT INTO TOMORROW MORNING. THIS FRONT
HAS ALREADY TRIGGERED OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE
STORMS ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE THIS EVENING. MODELS ARE SHOWING
THIS ACTIVITY PUSHING EASTWARD TONIGHT AND MOVING INTO THE WESTERN
ZONES AROUND/AFTER 06Z AND GRADUALLY WORKING ITS WAY EAST DURING
THE LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING HOURS. BASED ON THIS POTENTIAL...OPTED
TO INCREASE POPS TO THE 40-50 PERCENT RANGE ACROSS MUCH OF THE
AREA AFTER 06Z...AND HAVE BUMPED THEM UP TO LIKELY ACROSS THE FAR
WESTERN ZONES. INSTABILITY PARAMETERS ARE NOT TOO IMPRESSIVE...BUT
MODELS DO INDICATE CAPE VALUES AOA 1000-1500 J/KG CREEPING INTO THE
WESTERN ZONES BTWN 09-12Z...WHICH COULD PROMOTE A FEW STRONGER
STORMS LATE TONIGHT. THE MAIN THREATS WITH THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY
HOWEVER...WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. ALSO...GIVEN THE
INCREASED MOISTURE/EXPECTED CLOUD COVER TONIGHT...LOWS SHOULD BE
ABOUT 5-10 DEGREES WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT...WITH MOST LOWER

BASED ON CURRENT OB/TRENDS...HAVE INCREASED POPS SIGNIFICANTLY TO
ACCOUNT FOR THE BROAD AREA OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WORKING THEIR WAY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL LOSE ITS GRIP 
TODAY AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY REGION TONIGHT. A ZONAL FLOW ALOFT THIS MORNING WILL 
TRANSITION TO A DEEP SW FLOW WITH THE APPROACH OF BROAD UPPER 
TROUGH. 500 MB HEIGHTS WILL BE FALLING THROUGH THE DAY...BRINGING 
INCREASING CLOUDS...BUT PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO HOLD OFF UNTIL TONIGHT 
WHEN MOISTURE DEPTH AND LIFT INCREASE. THERE ARE SOME TIMING 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS AND THE NAM...WITH THE GFS BEING FASTER. 
BOTH HAVE LIKELY POPS...WHICH SEEMS A BIT HIGH GIVEN THE WEAK 
FORCING AND LACK OF PROLONGED MOISTURE FEED AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. THE 
SREF KEEPS POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE TONIGHT...AND THE FORECAST WILL 
FOLLOW THIS. TEMPS WILL BE TRENDING WARMER COMPARED TO THE LAST FEW 
DAYS...IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN THE VALLEY TODAY...AND LOWS IN THE 
60S TONIGHT UNDER BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE
REGION ON TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS ON BOTH TUESDAY AND MAINLY INTO THE EVENING HOURS ON
TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRIER WEATHER ON
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. ANOTHER FRONT ENTERS THE REGION ON THURSDAY
NIGHT AND LINGERS INTO SATURDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH THE HIGHEST
CHANCES GOING FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN THE DEEPEST
MOISTURE AND BEST LIFT IS EXPECTED. SOME DIFFERENCES IN TIMING ON
WHEN THE FRONT EXITS ON SATURDAY. WILL GO WITH THE DRIER SOLUTION
FROM THE ECMWF. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR
SUNDAY. STAYED NEAR THE MEX AND HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...
TRANQUIL WEATHER CONTINUES ACROSS THE AREA AS A WEAK SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE SYSTEM AND ZONAL FLOW ALOFT ARE PREVAILING OVER THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS EVENING. A COOL/DRY AIR MASS WILL
ONCE AGAIN ALLOW FOR EARLY FALL-LIKE OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES IN
THE MID/UPPER 50S TO AROUND 60 DEGREES IN THE METRO AREAS. TO THE
WEST OF THE REGION...A TROUGH OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER
VALLEY HAS TRIGGERED OFF AN AREA OF LIGHT/MODERATE SHOWERS OVER THAT
WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENING WITH THE LOSS
OF HEATING AS THEY MOVE INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE. STILL...INCREASED
POPS SLIGHTLY IN THE WESTERN ZONES UP FROM ZERO TO ACCOUNT FOR THE
POSSIBLY OF A ROGUE LIGHT SHOWER APPROACHING THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU. HOWEVER...SAW NO REASON TO INCREASE POPS TO NEAR/ABOVE
MENTIONABLE LEVELS. LATE TONIGHT...THE POTENTIAL FOR PATCHY FOG
WILL EXIST ONCE AGAIN IN LOCALIZED SHELTERED AREAS/LOCATIONS NEAR
BODIES OF WATER...THOUGH SOME PASSING MID/HIGH CLOUDS COULD HELP TO
PREVENT VISIBILITIES FROM DROPPING DOWN TOO LOW IN SOME SPOTS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT TRAILING SOUTHWEST OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH 
CLOUDS AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT...AND EXPECT THESE HIGH CLOUDS TO 
GRADUALLY INCREASE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND MONDAY AS THE 
COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACHES. GFS AND NAM MODELS BOTH INDICATE SOME 
PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION MOVING EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON 
MONDAY NIGHT...BUT THEN DISAGREE ON THE TIMING OF THIS COLD FRONT 
FOR TUESDAY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE PROGRESSION OF THE UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH. GFS MODEL GENERALLY HAS A FASTER EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE 
COLD FRONT...WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECTED ON TUESDAY MORNING. NAM 
MODEL REVEALS A LATER FRONTAL PASSAGE ON TUESDAY EVENING...AND THUS 
DEVELOPS A VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF 
THE COLD FRONT ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON. ECMWF MODEL SEEMS TO AGREE WITH 
THE SLOWER NAM SOLUTION...SO WILL TREND THE FORECAST TOWARDS AN IDEA 
OF SOME PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON 
MONDAY NIGHT...AND THEN ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT ON 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. WITH A VERY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS POSSIBLY DEVELOPING ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON...ALONG 
WITH AN INCREASING MID LEVEL WIND FLOW...IT APPEARS THAT THERE COULD 
BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR ORGANIZED SEVERE STORMS ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING (IF THE NAM/ECMWF SOLUTION VERIFIES). WILL UPDATE THE 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO FURTHER DEFINE THESE POSSIBILITIES. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BUT THEN REVEAL SOME DIFFERENCES FOR TUESDAY 
AND TUESDAY NIGHT DUE TO THE FRONTAL TIMING DIFFERENCES. FOR NOW... 
WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO ON TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT.

A SURFACE FRONT AND MIDLEVEL TROUGH AXIS ARE OVER THE AREA THIS
MORNING...AND THIS WILL MAKE FOR A TRICKY CLOUD FORECAST THROUGH
THE MORNING. THE DEVELOPMENT OF FOG AND LOW CEILINGS WILL DEPEND ON
THE AMOUNT OF MIDLEVEL CLEARING OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. SATELLITE
TRENDS SUGGEST SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE CLEARING REACHES THE TAF
SITES...SO WILL GO WITH A FORECAST OF CURRENT CONDITIONS PERSISTING
THROUGH THE MORNING. IF MIDLEVEL CLOUDS EXIT FASTER...FOG AND LOW
CEILING POTENTIAL IS HIGHER. ALL SITES WILL SEE SCATTERED CLOUDS BY

A COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO PUSH EASTWARD THIS EVENING FROM MIDDLE
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHEASTERN KENTUCKY...BRINGING WITH IT A COOLER AND
DRIER AIRMASS TO THE REGION. ALONG/AHEAD OF THE FRONT...ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS ARE STILL LINGERING ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND
ALONG THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS THIS EVENING...THOUGH A GENERAL
DISSIPATING TREND IS EXPECTED BY THE LATE EVENING GIVEN THE LOSS OF
DAYTIME HEATING AND A MORE STABLE ATMOSPHERE DEVELOPING. SOME DENSE
CLOUD COVER ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE IS GRADUALLY GIVING WAY TO MOSTLY
CLEAR CONDITIONS BEHIND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AS DRIER AIR WORKS ITS
WAY INTO THE REGION. STILL...GIVEN THE SLOWER SPEED OF THE
FRONT...SOME CLOUD COVER MAY LINGER ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND NE
TENNESSEE/SW VIRGINIA THROUGH MUCH OF THE OVERNIGHT HOURS /WHILE
POINTS ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR/. THIS
CLOUD COVER WILL BE A LIMITING FACTOR FOR ANY FOG DEVELOPMENT IN
THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER AHEAD OF THE FRONT. GIVEN THIS /ALONG WITH
THE DRIER AIR AND NW WINDS LIKELY RESULTING IN SOME MIXING/...OPTED
TO LEAVE A MENTION OF FOG OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR NOW. HOWEVER...
CERTAIN LOCALIZED SHELTERED AREAS COULD SEE SOME DEVELOPMENT AFTER
06Z. GIVEN THE COOLER/DRIER AIRMASS...LOWS WILL ALSO BE NOTABLY
COOLER IN SEVERAL LOCATIONS...BOTTOMING OUT IN THE UPPER 50S TO
LOWER 60S IN MANY AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER MIDDLE TN AND 
CENTRAL KY...WITH AREA RADARS REVEALING A LINE OF PRE-FRONTAL 
SHOWERS MOVING EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT 
AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL FURTHER AMPLIFY OVER 
THE OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS THIS AFTERNOON...PUSHING THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING WILL LIKELY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF SOLAR 
WARMING FOR THIS AFTERNOON...BUT THE MODELS SUGGEST THAT THE LOCAL 
AIR MASS WILL STILL BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO 
THE COLDER AIR ALOFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH. THUS...EXPECT 
ANOTHER LINE OF CONVECTION TO REDEVELOP ALONG THE COLD FRONT THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY POPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON. 
THE MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH

A CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL BE IN THE VICINITY OF THE GREAT LAKES AND

AREA TODAY. THE FRONT ACTING ON A MOIST LOW LEVEL AIR MASS WILL 
RESULT IN LIKELY POPS THROUGH TODAY. MORNING CLOUD COVER WILL LIMIT

DRIER AIR WILL BE WORKING INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT TONIGHT. PW 
VALUES DROP TO UNDER 1 INCH BY MIDNIGHT...WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS

A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM AND IT'S ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT
MOVING THROUGH THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THIS FEATURE WILL HELP TO
TRIGGER OFF SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE REGION
TODAY AND TONIGHT. GIVEN THE PROGGED INSTABILITY VALUES /WITH CAPE
VALUES AOA 1500-2500 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES AOA -5C TO -6C/...
STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. THUS...FAIRLY DECENT
CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION WILL EXIST AREAWIDE...PARTICULARLY AFTER
18Z. THE PRIMARY THREATS WITH THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY WILL BE LOW-
END SEVERE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS /AS INDICATED BY THE INVERTED-V
SOUNDING PROFILES/. WITH PWATS PROGGED TO BE AROUND 1.5-1.6
INCHES...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IS LIKELY WITH ANY ACTIVITY THAT
DOES DEVELOP. LATER TONIGHT...AS THE AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT
MOVES INTO KENTUCKY...ADDITIONAL STORMS WILL DEVELOP AND MOVE SOUTH
INTO THE NORTHERN ZONES LATE TONIGHT. THUS...HAVE INCREASED POPS
AFTER 00Z ACROSS THIS AREA /SHOWING A SLIGHT GRADIENT FROM
NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST/. HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE A FEW
DEGREES COOLER GIVEN THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES
/WITH READINGS GENERALLY REMAINING BELOW 90 DEGREES IN THE MID TO
UPPER 80S/.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
MODELS GENERALLY CONSISTENT WITH 12Z RUNS THIS MORNING...SUCH THAT
PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS WERE GENERALLY RIGHT ON TRACK. TIMING OF

RATE...HIGHEST POPS STILL SEEM JUSTIFIED IN THE 12Z-00Z PERIOD
FRIDAY...ALTHOUGH I DID GIVE A W-E POP GRADIENT LOOK TO FRIDAY MORNING
THEN LIKELY ALL AREAS BY THE AFTERNOON.

SOUNDINGS SHOW A UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND PROFILE WITH MODEST SPEED 
SHEAR...WHILE INSTABILITY WILL BE AT LEAST MODERATE. IT WAS 
INTERESTING TO NOTE THAT OUR MOISTURE SUPPLY IS MAINLY LOW AND UPPER 
LEVELS...WHILE THERE IS CONSIDERABLE DRY AIR IN THE MID LEVELS.  
THIS DRY AIR IN THE MID LEVELS WOULD ENHANCE DOWNDRAFT/DOWNBURST 
POTENTIAL...SUGGESTING MAINLY A DAMAGING WIND THREAT WITH STRONGEST 
CONVECTION FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

FOR OTHER PERIODS...AFTER BRIEF SPOTTY MORNING SHOWERS IN THE EAST 
ON SATURDAY...A DRY FORECAST REMAINS IN ORDER INTO MONDAY NIGHT. 
GFSX MOS POPS ARE REPEATING THE PATTERN OF HIGHER POPS FOR TUESDAY 
FROM THE 00Z RUN COMPARED TO THE 12Z RUN. THE PREDICTED SYNOPTIC 
PATTERN DOES NOT SUPPORT CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY OR TUESDAY NIGHT... 
SO KEPT CONTINUITY WITH JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. MODEL

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT ISOBAR ANALYSIS 
INDICATES A WEAK AND DIFFUSE FRONTAL BOUNDARY ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...BUT A VERY MOIST AIR MASS 
STILL LINGERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S 
TO LOWER 70S. THIS MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS EXPECTED TO LINGER 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS...UNTIL A COLD 
FRONT PUSHES THROUGH THE REGION BY FRIDAY NIGHT. AN UPPER-LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE AHEAD OF THE MAIN LONG-WAVE TROUGH IS PROGGED TO SWING 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON...TRIGGERING 
SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLY 
PRODUCING DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. THE LONG WAVE 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH THEN AMPLIFIES AND BECOMES UNSEASONABLY STRONG 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION ON FRIDAY...WITH A COLD FRONT 
PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 
THIS SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN A GOOD COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ON 
FRIDAY...WITH A GOOD CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER AS WELL. THE MAIN 
SEVERE THREATS APPEAR TO BE THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING WINDS... 
LARGE HAIL...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH 
AXIS WILL FOLLOW SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY OUT OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON SATURDAY SO REMOVED POP FROM MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA WHILE LEAVING JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM 
OVER THE EASTERN THIRD...MAINLY DURING THE MORNING. DRIER AND 
SOMEWHAT "MILDER" AIR BUILDS IN ON SUNDAY AND WHILE TEMPERATURES 
CLIMB A DEGREE OR TWO BY MONDAY HUMIDITY LEVELS SHOULD REMAIN 
RELATIVELY LOW. KEPT A DRY MONDAY GOING AS SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW 
WILL NOT BE FULLY DEVELOPED. BY TUESDAY MOISTURE RETURN WILL BE 
SUFFICIENT ALONG WITH A DESTABILIZING ATMOSPHERE AND A POSSIBLE 
SHORT WAVE ARRIVAL TO KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING FOR CONVECTION. 
INCREASING MOISTURE AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS WITH THE HINT OF MORE 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY ON WEDNESDAY REQUIRED KEEPING AT LEAST A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP GOING AT THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. ADJUSTED MAX 
TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD QUITE CLOSE TO IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW 
GUIDANCE WHICH ATTEMPTS TOO RAPID A WARMING SCENARIO FOLLOWING 
AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MINS EXCEPT 
TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD WHERE GUIDANCE LOOKS A LITTLE TOO COOL 
WITH RETURNING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN PLACE.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
EARLY THIS MORNING...SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS CONTINUE TO
PERSIST ACROSS THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS INTO THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW
NORTH CAROLINA. THOUGH A BRIEF BURST OF MODERATE/HEAVY RAIN MAY
OCCUR WITH THIS ACTIVITY...AN OVERALL WEAKENING TREND IS EXPECTED
OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS AS THESE SHOWERS SHOULD DISSIPATE BY
DAYBREAK. SOME PATCHY FOG IS ALSO EXPECTED GIVEN THE MOIST BOUNDARY

COVER AND SHOWERS MAY TEMPER DEVELOPMENT SOMEWHAT IN SOME LOCATIONS
UNTIL DAYBREAK. STILL...WILL MAINTAIN THE DENSE FOG ADVISORY
ACROSS NE TENNESSEE/SW VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAIN ZONES FROM 09-13Z
AS SKIES SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR EARLY THIS MORNING. WITH A WEAK
SURFACE HIGH MOVING OVER EAST TENNESSEE TODAY...DRIER AND SLIGHTLY
WARMER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AREAWIDE AS THE MERCURY SHOULD
REACH THE LOW TO MID 90S ACROSS A BULK OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.
MODELS /THE NAM-12 IN PARTICULAR/ ARE SHOWING LITTLE TO NO
CONVECTIVE SIGNALS...BUT HAVE MAINTAINED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
AREAWIDE THROUGH MID EVENING TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME ISOLATED DIURNALLY
INDUCED ACTIVITY THAT SHOULD DEVELOP WITHIN THE WARM...MOIST
AIRMASS.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
WEAK RIDGING THURSDAY WILL GIVE WAY TO A LEAD SHORTWAVE TROUGH...
BUT I THINK ISOLATED TO SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION...UNTIL
PERHAPS LATER THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. THE DEEPENING UPPER
TROUGH AND APPROACHING COLD FRONT SUPPORT OUR CURRENT LIKELY POPS
FOR FRIDAY...SO NO CHANGES MADE FOR THOSE PERIODS.

FRONTAL PASSAGE OCCURS PRIOR TO 12Z SATURDAY...BUT ENERGY COMING 
AROUND THE UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH WILL REQUIRE KEEPING LOW POPS IN 
FOR MOST AREAS ON SATURDAY. GFS/CANADIAN/ECMWF AND SREF ALL FAVOR 
KEEPING SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT DRY. GFSX MOS POPS ARE 
INCREASING FOR TUESDAY AND ARE ABOVE CLIMO...SO OPTED TO ADD SLIGHT

351 AM EDT TUE AUG 7 2012

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
HARD TO PIN DOWN THE LOCATION OF THE WEAKENING COLD FRONT THIS
MORNING...BUT SOME DRYING HAS OCCURRED AT 850 MB LEVEL ACROSS SE KY
AND SW VA AREAS. 07/00Z SOUNDINGS FROM OHX AND RNK SHOW
PWAT VALUES DOWN SLIGHTLY TO AROUND 1.5 INCHES. RADAR SHOWS A FEW
SHOWERS DEVELOPING ACROSS EXTREME SE TN AND SWRN NC...WITH MOVEMENT
SLOWLY NE. GIVEN THE SLIGHT DRYING I PREFERRED THE DRIER LOOK OF
THE 00Z NAM MODEL...SO POPS WERE LOWERED BY ABOUT 10 TO 15 PERCENT.
HIGHEST POPS SE TN/SW NC DOWN TO JUST SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS MOST OF
SWRN VA TODAY. SOME PATCHY FOG NOTED BUT PASSING HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD
KEEP VISBY FROM BOTTOMING OUT.

LITTLE CHANGES MADE FOR TONIGHT FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS...KEEPING THOSE 
LOW POPS JUST FOR THE EVENING THEN DRY. FOG DEVELOPMENT MAY BE MORE 
WIDESPREAD TONIGHT. OTHERWISE...STUCK CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR HIGHS 
TODAY AND A BLEND OF MOS FOR MINS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
A LINGERING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL FINALLY SKIRT OFF TO THE EAST OF 
THE REGION WITH THE PASSAGE OF AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
TONIGHT...WHICH THIS WILL RESULT IN A DRIER FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY 
/WITH THE NAM-12 SHOWING ALMOST NO CONVECTIVE SIGNALS/ ACROSS THE 
AREA. GIVEN THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER HOWEVER...STILL THINK THAT 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ARE WARRANTED IN THE AFTN/EVENING FROM DIURNAL 
HEATING. THEREAFTER...MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE ACROSS THE 
REGION IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM 
ROTATING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO RIVER VALLEY. PRECIP CHANCES 
WILL INCREASE MARKEDLY BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT PROGGED TO DROP INTO THE AREA ON FRIDAY. AS A 
RESULT...HAVE MAINTAINED HIGH-END CHANCE POPS THURSDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT...BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST SATURDAY 
MORNING AS THE FRONT EXITS THE AREA. SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL 
BE POSSIBLE THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING...BUT OVERALL DRIER AND COOLER 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THIS WEEKEND IN WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM /WITH 
HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW TO MID 80S BEING LIKELY/. LOW-LEVEL 
MOISTURE WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE EARLY NEXT WEEK...WARRANTING 
LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS FOR MONDAY.

LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED CLOSE. COULD ALSO SEE PATCHY FOG FROM

CONTINUE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO TUESDAY. THE 
HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE AFTERNOON WHEN THE INSTABILITY INCREASES. 
STAYED NEAR BLEND TEMPERATURES FOR TUESDAY. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN REASONABLE
AGREEMENT OVERALL...AND FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR
THE LONG TERM PERIOD. ONE DISAGREEMENT IS THE AMOUNT OF DRYING
TUESDAY NIGHT/WED...WITH THE NAM SHOWING MORE DRYING THAN THE GFS.
THINK THERE WILL BE AT LEAST ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WED TO
WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SOME MAINLY AFTERNOON CONVECTION.
MOISTURE FORECAST TO INCREASE THURSDAY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD
FRONT. WILL CARRY HIGH CHANCE POPS THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. FRONT
SHOULD BE EXITING BY FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN MODELS SHOW COOLER AND

426 AM EDT MON AUG 6 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN CONCERN IS THE PROBLEMS 
CREATED BY SOME TORRENTIAL RAINFALL SUNDAY EVENING ACROSS OUR NRN 
PLATEAU COUNTIES...AND ALSO GENERALLY NE TN COUNTIES ALONG OR SE OF 
I-81 AND I-40. FLOODING CONTINUES IN THE EXTREME SOUTHERN END OF 
WASHINGTON COUNTY TN AT THIS TIME. BOTH JKL AND MRX RAINFALL 
ESTIMATES RANGED GENERALLY FROM 3 TO NEARLY 6 INCHES OF RAINFALL IN 
THESE AREAS. ACTUAL RAIN GAGE REPORTS INCLUDED 5.57 INCHES JUST NW 
OF THE TOWN OF UNICOI AND MY RAIN GAGE IN WHITE PINE (JEFFERSON
COUNTY) MEASURED NEARLY 3 INCHES LATE SUNDAY EVENING FROM A
DOWNPOUR OVER LESS THAN 2 HOURS.

SCATTERED CONVECTION ALREADY FIRING ALONG THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT 
WITH VERY HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AND K INDICES FROM ACTUAL 
06/00Z AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS. ALTHOUGH BEST CONVERGENCE AND LIFT 
FOR LATER TODAY LOOKS TO BE OROGRAPHIC (RATHER THAN FRONTOGENETIC 
FORCING)...FELT POPS NEEDED TO BE NUDGED UP TO LIKELY OVER MOST 
AREAS. WIND FIELDS RATHER WEAK SO I ANTICIPATE A SLOW STORM MOVEMENT 
EASTWARD...WHICH SUPPORTS A GOOD CHANCE OF MORE NUISANCE TO 
SIGNIFICANT FLOODING. FFG VALUES ARE LIKELY TO BE VERY LOW IN ANY 
AREAS WHERE HEAVY RAINS FELL YESTERDAY. ISSUED A FLOOD WATCH FOR 
GENERALLY ALL AREAS BUT SE TN AND SW NC...AFTER COORDINATION WITH 
OUR NWS NEIGHBORS. 

OTHERWISE...OPTED FOR COOLER MOS MAXES TODAY AND A BLEND OF MOS MINS 
LOOKED FINE FOR TONIGHT. NO MAJOR CHANGES MADE TO FORECAST GRIDS FOR 
TONIGHT...EVEN ABLE TO KEEP POP AND WEATHER GRIDS NEARLY UNCHANGED. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT SETTLES JUST
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY AND THEN BECOMES STATIONARY JUST
TO THE SOUTH TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. WITH UPPER FLOW PATTERN
STILL FROM THE NW DRIER AIR MASS MOVES IN. EASTERN SECTIONS WILL
HAVE BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND NW SECTIONS POSSIBLY DRY BUT WILL
LEAVE A 20 PERCENT CHANCE THERE. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM A FEW
DEGREES TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WITH MORE SUN. A NEW COLD FRONT
APPROACHES WITH DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES
THURSDAY AND MOVES THROUGH THE REGION FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. RAIN
CHANCES INCREASE. TEMPERATURES COOLER BEHIND NEXT FRONT SATURDAY
AND SUNDAY. MODELS TRY TO END PRECIPITATION BEHIND WEEKEND FRONT
EARLY SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY BUT WITH NW BEHIND IT AND LARGE RIDGE TO
THE WEST WILL LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR NOW AS SHORTWAVE
ENERGY MAY RIDE OVER RIDGE TO THE WEST.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...BRIEF LULL IN THE CONVECTIVE 
PRECIPITATION CONTINUES THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...LATEST RADAR TRENDS 
SHOW CONVECTION INCREASING FROM MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL KY WESTWARD TO 
THE COLD FRONT. HIGH POPS STILL SEEM IN ORDER FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT 
AS THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES AND THEN STALLS INTO MONDAY. ADJUSTED 
TIMING OF SHOWERS AND STORMS A BIT IN THE FORECAST GRIDS...BUT KEPT 
CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS LIKELY TO LOW END OF CATEGORICAL POPS. 

CLOUDS ON THE INCREASE WITH AN EARLY ONSET OF CONVECTION...WHICH 
FAVORS THE COOLER NAM MOS MAXES FOR TODAY. MOS MINS IN THE 60S TO 
LOWER 70S LOOKS GOOD FOR TONIGHT. 

LARGE SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE STORMS INCLUDES THE BULK OF OUR FORECAST 
AREA...WITH MAIN THREATS BEING DAMAGING WINDS...MARGINAL HAIL AND 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS. 

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LATE SUMMER COLD FRONT 
BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY MONDAY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN TN 
VALLEY. CONSIDERABLE CLOUD COVER TO START THE DAY AND POSSIBLE 
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE OCCURRING IN THE MORNING 
ALONG AND AHEAD OF FRONT. HIGHS A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN TODAY 
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN WHERE THERE SHOULD BE MORE CLOUD COVER 
OTHERWISE PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR HIGHS. AS TEMPERATURES WARM IN 
THE AFTERNOON AND THE MOIST AIR MASS BECOMES UNSTABLE THERE WILL BE 
SOME STRONG STORMS ALONG AND JUST SOUTH OF THE FRONT. SCATTERED 
STORMS WILL CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING UNTIL SUNSET THEN DECREASE 
WITH NIGHT TIME COOLING. LOWS SLIGHTLY COOLER BEHIND FRONT MONDAY 
NIGHT. TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY BROAD TROUGH CONTINUES OVER EAST 
AND FORECAST AREA WITH WEAK FRONT JUST TO THE SOUTH. MOIST UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS AND DAYTIME HEATING WILL KEEP SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING SHOWERS AND STORMS FORMING EACH DAY. THURSDAY FRONT 
DISSIPATES BUT PATTERN STAYS THE SAME. FRIDAY A NEW FRONT MOVES 
SOUTH INTO OHIO VALLEY AND THEN INTO EASTERN TN VALLEY SATURDAY. NO 
REAL CHANGE IN UPPER FLOW PATTERN BUT COOLER TEMPERATURES FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY OVER NORTHERN SECTIONS OF FORECAST AREA AS UPPER TROUGH 
DEEPENS OVER THE EASTERN STATES WITH NEXT FRONT. &&

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. DEBRIS CLOUDS FROM MORNING MCS 
BREAKING UP. THIS WILL ALLOW A FEW HOURS OF SUNSHINE FOR 
DESTABILIZATION. SHORT WAVE OVER MIDDLE TN WILL SLOW AS IT MOVES 
EAST THIS AFTERNOON. CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD CONTINUE AND REMAIN 
FAIRLY WIDESPREAD. WARM MOIST AIRMASS SHOULD HINDER SEVERE 
DEVELOPMENT. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN FOCUS THIS MORNING IS ON THE 
MCS DROPPING SE INTO MIDDLE TN. SATELLITE PICS SHOW TOPS STILL ON 
THE COLD SIDE...PLENTY OF LIGHTNING STRIKES AND INCREASING INTENSITY 
FROM AREA RADARS. SPC MESO PAGE SHOWS AREAS OF CONVERGENCE AND 
UNSTABLE AIRMASS WITH A LOW LEVEL THETA-E RIDGE INTO NE MS AND 
ANOTHER ACROSS THE NRN PLATEAU INTO SE TN THIS MORNING. UPPER FLOW 
SUPPORTS THIS MCS PUSHING SLOWLY SSE TOWARD OUR FORECAST AREA. 
ALREADY SEEING ISOLATED -TSRA AHEAD OF THIS MAIN ORGANIZED 
CONVECTION. 

PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK WITH A SLIGHT 
ADJUSTMENT OR TWO ON TIMING. EXPECTING AT LEAST SOME STRONG STORMS 
TODAY AND ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS ARE CERTAINLY POSSIBLE...ALTHO WIND 
SHEAR LOOKS TO BE ON THE WEAK SIDE. 

FOR TEMPS...WRN AND SRN AREAS MAY ONLY WARM TO THE LOWER NAM MOS 
HIGHS...WHILE NE AREAS HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO REACH 90 DEGS OR SO FOR 
HIGHS. MINS TONIGHT SHOULD BE RATHER PERSISTENT IN LINE WITH PAST 
FEW NIGHTS.  


LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...FORECAST AREA STILL IN A 
WEAKNESS AREA WITH UPPER RIDGE TO THE WEST AND BERMUDA HIGH OFF THE 
EAST COAST. SLOW MOVING SHORTWAVE CROSSING THE REGION SATURDAY SO 
GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH A FEW STRONG TO 
POSSIBLY SEVERE STORMS. THEN A DECREASE SATURDAY NIGHT DUE TO 
COOLING. UPPER TROUGH AND COOL FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY 
SUNDAY AND AIR MASS ACROSS THE TN VALLEY BECOMES QUITE UNSTABLE. 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD BECOME SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WINDS 
AND LARGE HAIL POSSIBLE. ACTIVITY SHOULD BE SCATTERED SUNDAY BUT 
SUNDAY NIGHT SHOULD BECOME MORE NUMEROUS NORTH AS UPPER TROUGH 
APPROACHES. COLD FRONT TRIES TO MOVE THROUGH MONDAY BUT SLOWS AND 
BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY INTO TUESDAY. FLOW REMAINS OUT OF THE NW 
AND WITH FRONT NEARBY THIS WILL KEEP GOOD CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND 
STORMS AROUND BOTH DAYS. THE FRONT BECOMES WASHED OUT BY WEDNESDAY 
WITH SOME DRYING OVER THE NW HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. BEST RAIN 
CHANCES WILL BE ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. 
HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL SATURDAY AND SUNDAY 80S TO 
NEAR 90 AND LOWS MID 60S TO LOWER 70S...AND THE SAME GENERAL TREND 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EXTENDED DUE TO CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS AND 
DAILY RAIN CHANCES.

WITH A VERY HUMID AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA 
RADARS REVEAL THAT CONVECTION HAS ENDED...BUT WILL KEEP A SLIGHT

DIURNAL CONVECTION DEVELOP OVER THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH BEST 
CHANCE OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  CONVECTION SHOULD LINGER INTO THE

AREAS OVERNIGHT.  AS FOR TEMPERATURES...IT WILL BE ANOTHER HOT DAY 
WITH TEMPERATURES EXPECTED TO REACH INTO THE 90S OVER MUCH OF THE TN

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FOR FRIDAY...SOUTHERLY 
BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS INCREASE PULLING SUB-TROPICAL MOISTURE BACK 
INTO THE AREA WITH PWS RAISING TO 2+ INCHES AT BOTH CHA AND TYS.
MAIN FORCING WILL BE TERRAIN FEATURES...SO HIGHEST POPS WILL BE 
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS. FOR SATURDAY...A WEAK UPPER TROUGH AND 
ABUNDANT SUB-TROPICAL MOISTURE (PWS 2-2.25 INCHES) WITH NO CAP WILL 
ALLOW WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP. HEAVY RAINS 
ARE LIKELY WITH LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING POSSIBLE.

FOR SUNDAY...PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY REMAIN ACROSS THE 
AREA. A STRONGER UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW INCREASING AHEAD OF INCOMING FRONT. 
MODELS SHOW GREATEST INSTABILITY OVER MID AND LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY WITH SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE THERE DURING THE 
AFTERNOON. THIS AREA OF STORMS MOVING EAST TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA 
AND CONVECTION DEVELOPING ON LOW TERRAIN WILL CONTINUE HIGH CHANCES 
OF STORMS. THERE IS A POTENTIAL OF SEVERE STORMS OVER THE AREA.

FOR MONDAY...FRONT MOVES EAST OF THE AREA AS WELL AS UPPER TROUGH SO 
DECREASING CHANCES OF RAIN FROM EAST TO WEST WITH DRY CONDITIONS 
ANTICIPATED FOR MONDAY NIGHT.

DRIER AIR WILL BE IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION ON TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY IN WAKE OF FRONTAL PASSAGE. PWAT VALUES DROP UNDER ONE 
INCH WITH DRIER AIR IN PLACE. UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO MOVE OFF TO 
THE EAST ON TUESDAY WHILE SURFACE RIDGING BEGINS BUILDING BACK IN

DESTABILIZED...ESPECIALLY ACROSS MIDDLE AND SE TN THIS AFTERNOON. 
DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION UNDERWAY AND WILL CONTINUE INTO THE 
EVENING HOURS. WEAK MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL AID IN DEVELOPMENT OF 
STORMS AS IT MOVE SE THROUGH THE AREA THIS EVENING. SMALL HAIL AND 
STRONG GUSTY WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT. PATCHY OVERNIGHT VALLEY 
FOG EXPECTED. AIRMASS DRIES OUT SOME TONIGHT AND THURSDAY IN WAKE OF 
SHORT WAVE. CONVECTION WILL BE ISOLATED AND MAINLY ACROSS THE 
SMOKIES THURSDAY. LOW LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES RISE SOME ON 
THU...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SE TN. NAM MOS APPEARS TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH 
100F AT CHA AND WENT WITH A BLEND BETWEEN GFS AND NAM WHICH IS CLOSE 
TO 01/00Z ECMWF.     

.LONG TERM (TOMORROW NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...AN UPPER-RIDGE 
SITUATED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL GRADUALLY FLATTEN LATE THIS 
WEEK AND NUDGE EASTWARD...PROMOTING SOME WARMER TEMPERATURES FOR 
FRIDAY AS THE MERCURY SHOULD CLIMB INTO THE LOWER  90S IN MANY 
AREAS. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER AND A WEAK SHORTWAVE 
PASSING THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY...SOME FAIRLY REASONABLE CHANCES FOR 
SCATTERED STORMS WILL EXIST DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. SOME 
ADDITIONAL DECENT THUNDER CHANCES WILL EXIST THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK AS THE AFOREMENTIONED RIDGE MOVES BACK TO THE WEST...AND A 
STRONG UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES PUSHES A 
FRONT TOWARD THE AREA SATURDAY EVENING INTO SUNDAY. THIS WILL RESULT 
IN THE BEST CHANCES FOR STORMS IN THE PERIOD SUNDAY INTO MONDAY AS 
THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS THE EASTERN CONUS. HEADING 
INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...DRIER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AS 
ZONAL FLOW RETURNS AND THE RIDGE BUILDS BACK INTO THE REGION. SOME 
LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS WERE STILL REQUIRED GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR 
DIURNAL CONVECTION IN THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER. HIGHS LOOK TO 
INCREASE FROM THE UPPER 80S EARLY IN THE WEEK TO THE LOW TO PERHAPS 
MID 90S IN SOME SPOTS BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SKIES HAVE FOR THE MOST
PART BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY THIS AFTERNOON IN THE WAKE OF MCS THAT
STARTED THE DAY OFF OVER SE TN AND NORTHERN ALABAMA. TEMPERATURES
ROSE MORE MODESTLY AND REACHED THE MID TO UPPER 80S BY MID
AFTERNOON WITH HIGHER ELEVATION SITES AND LOCATIONS IN SW VA AND NE
TN ONLY IN THE 70S. CONVECTION HAS BEEN VERY LIMITED ACROSS TN BUT
HAS BEEN ISOLATED TO SCATTERED IN SW VA WITH A FEW STRONGER STORMS
THERE. THINK THERE WILL STILL BE 20 TO 30 PERCENT COVERAGE
ESPECIALLY THE NEXT FEW HOURS AS PEAK HEATING IS REACHED A LITTLE
LATER TODAY BEFORE ACTIVITY DISSIPATES THIS EVENING. HOWEVER NOT
MUCH AS FORMED YET ALONG BOUNDARIES LEFT BY CONVECTION THIS MORNING
IN THE SOUTH. NW FLOW ALOFT AROUND UPPER RIDGE TO THE WEST WILL
CONTINUE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. A SHORTWAVE OVER IN THIS AFTERNOON
SHOULD TRACK INTO KY EARLY TONIGHT AND INTO SW VA LATER TONIGHT.
WILL KEEP LOW POPS IN LONGER THIS REGION TONIGHT AND ELSEWHERE
ACTIVITY SHOULD END AROUND SUNSET. WEDNESDAY UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH WEKA SURFACE LOWER PRESSURE OVER THE TN
VALLEY. THE DEEPER MOISTURE REMAINS TO THE SOUTH BUT SOME LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE REMAINS OVER THE REGION. MORE WEAK IMPULSES MOVE SE FROM
THE OHIO VALLEY AND WILL LIKELY TRIGGER ISOLATED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS
AND A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE OVER SW VA. LOWS TONIGHT LOOK TO BE
SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN LAST NIGHT WITH PATCHY FOG AND HIGHS WEDNESDAY
MUCH WARMER WITH MORE SUNSHINE IN THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
MODELS ARE IN BASIC AGREEMENT WITH KEEPING THE NWLY FLOW ALOFT
UNTIL THE STRONG SHORTWAVE OUT OF CANADA SQUASHES THE UPPER PART OF
THE RIDGE WHICH CHANGES THE FLOW AND ALLOWS THE RIDGE TO SWELL
TEMPORARILY OVER US FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. HOWEVER...BY SUNDAY
THE SHORT WAVE PUSHES EASTWARD INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND DRAGS ITS
TAIL THROUGH OUR AREA. IN THE WAKE OF THE SHORT WAVE IT LOOKS LIKE
THE END OF THIS FORECAST PERIOD WILL SEE THE UPPER RIDGE TRYING TO
RE-ESTABLISH ITSELF.

LOOKS PRETTY QUIET NOW FOR THE EARLY PARTS OF THIS PERIOD...THE NEXT 
CHANCE FOR SOME POPS ACROSS A MAJORITY OF THE AREA LOOKS TO BE 
FRIDAY.  ALL MODELS AGREE ON A SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH THEN...BUT 
MOISTURE LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE MARGINAL...SO KEEPING POPS PRETTY LOW.

A COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO THE AREA IN THE SUN/MON TIME 
FRAME.  LOOKS LIKE GOOD CHANCES OF SHOWERS/STORMS WHEN THE FRONT 
GETS CLOSE...JUST TIMING IS QUESTIONABLE RIGHT NOW...SO NOTHING 
ABOVE "CHANCE" POPS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD NOW.

FOR TEMPS...WENT BELOW GUIDANCE MORE ON SUNDAY--LOOKING LIKE THE 
BEST CHANCE FOR CLOUD COVER AND WET CONDITIONS ARE CENTERED ON 
SUNDAY.  WILL NEED TO WATCH FOR TIMING...BUT LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST 
PART OF THE AREA WILL GET PRETTY WET DURING A 48 HOUR WINDOW THAT 
I'VE CENTERED ON SUNDAY RIGHT NOW.

COVER AND NOT AS MUCH SHOWER COVERAGE.

SHORT TERM MODELS SHOW BREAK IN CONVECTION NEXT FEW HOURS BUT DAY

DID NOT ADD ACTIVITY IN PAST 00Z TONIGHT BUT WILL LOOK AT NEW DATA
FOR AFTERNOON PACKAGE. LOWERED TEMPS A COUPLE DEGREES NORTH AND
TRIMMED POPS BACK SLIGHTLY NW FOR THE AFTERNOON. THINK WITH

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MAIN WEATHER STORY FOR THE
SHORT-TERM IS A SHORT-WAVE MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE MID-SECTION
OF THE NATION. THIS WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING. MODELS SHOW
FAIRLY DECENT DIVERGENCE ALOFT WITH THIS SYSTEM. SPC ANALYSIS SHOWS
A VERY MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR-MASS ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY WHICH WILL FEED NORTHEAST INTO A WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY
ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE AND ALABAMA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWS THE
VERY MOIST...UNSTABLE AIR MOVING INTO THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. THE STRONG UPPER LIFT WILL PRODUCE A
COMPLEX OF THUNDERSTORMS THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS MAINLY THE SOUTHERN
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

DUE TO THE EXPECTED INSTABILITY AND SHEAR...SOME OF THESE STORMS
COULD BE SEVERE LATE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING. ALSO...HIGHS PWS
(AOB 2 INCHES AND K INDICES OF 40+) WILL SET THE STAGE FOR HEAVY
RAINFALL. ISOLATED FLASH FLOODING PROBLEMS ARE POSSIBLE.

FOR TUESDAY...WAVE MOVES EAST...BUT INSTABILITY REMAINS. WILL COULD
SEE ADDITIONAL 20-30 PERCENT COVERAGE OF STORMS DURING THE
AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...FAIRLY BUSY NORTHWEST 
FLOW PATTERN FOR THE EARLY PARTS OF THIS PERIOD WITH THE 
UPPER HIGH CENTERED OVER W TX AND THE UPPER LOW OVER HUDSON BAY.  
THE PATTERN IS SLIGHTLY AFFECTED AS A CUT-OFF LOW MOVES EWD ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN TIER AND THE LOW'S SHORT WAVE APPROACHES AROUND OUR 
AREA SATURDAY AND LOOKS TO SETTLE INTO THE AREA AROUND 
SUNDAY...ALTHOUGH MUCH OF THE ENERGY OF THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO BE 
WANING AND IS MORE FOCUSED IN THE GREAT LAKES.  THE ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT LOOKS TO BE STRUGGLING TO MAKE IT HERE BY THE END OF THIS 
FORECAST PERIOD...BUT WILL BE IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD.

THE WAVE THAT IS CAUSING THE NEED FOR POPS TONIGHT AND TUESDAY WILL 
BE WELL SOUTH OF THE AREA BY TUESDAY EVENING...MODEL SOUNDINGS 
GENERALLY SHOW A MODERATE CAPPING INVERSION BY LATE TUESDAY AS 
WELL...SO GOING WITH DRY FORECAST FOR TUESDAY EVENING.  WILL KEEP 
THINGS DRY UNTIL THURSDAY AFTERNOON WHEN NEXT CLIPPER-TYPE SYSTEM IS 
DUE TO RACE THROUGH THE AREA THAT NIGHT...THEN POPS RIGHT THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND AS LIFT AND MOISTURE GATHER OVER MUCH OF THE SE US. BY 
THE VERY END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...MOISTURE MAY BE SLIDING EAST 
OF THE AREA...BUT STILL A LONG WAY OFF.

FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY GOING A LITTLE ON THE COOL SIDE OF HIGH 
TEMPS...BUT LITTLE ADJUSTMENT TO MID TEMPS.

TENNESSEE VALLEY OVERNIGHT PRODUCING A THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX MAINLY
OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT.

FOR TODAY...MAIN FORCING WILL BE LOCAL TERRAIN WITH BEST CHANCE OF
STORMS OVER THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU DUE
TO BETTER MOISTURE/INSTABILITY/OROGRAPHIC FORCING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONVECTION CHANCES LOOK RATHER 
LIMITED TODAY AS BOUNDARY LAYER SHOULD STILL BE ON THE DRY SIDE.  
WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
AREAS...BUT WILL GO PRECIP FREE FOR MAIN VALLEY AREAS.  MODELS 
INDICATE MOISTURE WILL INCREASE TONIGHT...AND AN MCS MAY MOVE 
SOUTHEAST INTO THE AREA.  WHILE TIMING AND EXACT LOCATION STILL 
UNCERTAIN...APPEARS BEST CHANCES WILL BE AFTER MIDNIGHT AND SOUTHERN 
AREAS MORE LIKELY TO BE AFFECTED. WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS SOUTH AND 
LOW CHANCE NORTH LATE TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO ONLY A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.       

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHOULD BE AN ACTIVE PERIOD 
FOLLOWING A RELATIVELY QUIET WEEKEND AS THE ATMOSPHERE REALLY 
DOESN'T WANT TO RECONFIGURE FOR ANY LENGTHY PERIOD. A MEAN UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH WILL STAY IN PLACE OVER THE EASTERN STATES WITH JUST A 
BIT OF DE-AMPLIFICATION AROUND THURSDAY. NICE LOOKING SHORT WAVE 
BUILDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY AND MODELS SEEM TO BE IN 
AGREEMENT THAT THE MAIN FORCING WITH THE WAVE WILL BE DURING THE 
MORNING AS THE FEATURE SHIFTS OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST. ADJUSTED POP TO 
LIKELY CATEGORY FOR MOST OF THE AREA WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE 
CONVECTION WITH THE HEALTHY LOOKING SYSTEM. DROPPED POPS BACK TO LOW 
OR SLIGHT CHANCE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WITH MODELS INDICATING 
SOME TRAILING...WEAKER ENERGY STREAMING IN ON THE PREVAILING 
NORTHWEST FLOW. BY THURSDAY MODELS POINT TOWARD A LITTLE DRIER AND 
LESS UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE REGION SO ADJUSTED POPS BACK 
ACCORDINGLY. PERHAPS ANOTHER WEAK FEATURE SWINGS EAST ACROSS THE 
OHIO VALLEY ON FRIDAY BUT BETTER CHANCE FOR MORE ORGANIZED 
CONVECTION MAY DEVELOP OVER THE WEEKEND WITH MODELS POINTING TOWARD 
A COUPLE STRONGER LOOKING SHORT WAVE SYSTEMS RIDING SOUTHEAST ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH A SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY 
EDGING SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. 
CONCERNING TEMPERATURE FORECAST GENERALLY ADJUSTED MAX TEMPS BACK A 
DEGREE OR SO EARLY IN THE PERIOD WHILE MORE AGGRESSIVELY LOWERING 
HIGH TEMPERATURES WHICH APPEAR TO BE TOO WARM FROM THURSDAY INTO THE 
WEEKEND WITH THE MORE ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN WHICH FEATURES TRANSIT 
OF NUMEROUS UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVELENGTH SYSTEMS. ALSO RAISED MIN

A MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE WILL BE PASSING OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE NEXT 
24 HOURS. WEAK RIDGING WILL BE OVER THE AREA TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...FOLLOWED BY A TROUGH THAT WILL BE APPROACHING TOMORROW. 
MID TO HIGH CLOUDS SEEN IN VIS SAT NEAR THE NOSE OF A JET MAY BRING 
SOME CLOUDS TO SOUTHERN AREAS TONIGHT...WITH NORTHERN AREAS STAYING 
MOSTLY CLEAR WITH PATCHY FOG LATE. BASED ON AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS WITH 
NEUTRAL ADVECTION...LOW SHOULD BE MAINLY IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S 
TONIGHT. THE CAPPING INVERSION IN PLACE TODAY WILL BE WEAKENED 
TOMORROW ACROSS THE NORTH. DIFFULENT UPPER LEVEL FLOW AT THE NOSE OF 
THE JET IN NORTHERN SECTIONS ALONG WITH SLIGHTLY FALLING MIDLEVEL 
HEIGHTS AND TEMPS SHOULD AID THE A CHANCE OF AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS NORTH. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SUGGEST A WEAK CAP WILL 
REMAIN IN PLACE FOR SOUTHERN SECTIONS. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
NOT MUCH CHANGE TO CURRENT FORECAST AS MODELS BRING SHORT WAVES INTO 
THE TN VALLEY REGION MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS WEAK FRONT TO THE 
SOUTH SHIFTS BACK TO THE NORTH ENHANCING SHOWER DEVELOPMENT OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THEN WEDNESDAY SOME DRYING ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS 
AND SMALLER SHORTWAVE FEATURE DEVELOPS SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTH. 
THURSDAY MAY BE A DRY DAY FOR MOST OF THE AREA STILL BETWEEN 
SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVES BUT FOR NOW LOWERED POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE 
NORTH AND CHANCE EXTREME SOUTH. FRIDAY AND SATURDAY MORE SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY SHOULD INCREASE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES ONCE AGAIN. 
UPPER TROUGH STAYS OVER THE EASTERN STATES AND UPPER FLOW REMAINS 
OUT OF THE NW SO NOT THAT CONFIDENT IN TIMING OF SYSTEMS FOR THE 
EXTENDED. FROM THE FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY PERIOD ECMWF AND GFS HINT 
AT RIDGE STRENGTHENING AGAIN OVER THE TN VALLEY WHICH COULD SYSTEMS 
TO THE NW STAYING NORTH IN THE OHIO VALLEY AND SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS MORE DIURNALLY DRIVEN AND FAVORING THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES TUESDAY WITH MORE CLOUDS 
AND PRECIPITATION MOUNTAINS AND NORTH AND THEN A FEW DEGREES WARMER 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. MIN TEMPS WARMER THAN THE LAST COUPLE OF 
NIGHTS FOR THE TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY PERIOD MAINLY UPPER 60S TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
A WEAK FRONT WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT AND HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FROM THE NORTH BEHIND IT...WITH THE MAIN 
IMPACT BEING LOWER DEWPOINTS. WITH LOWER 60S DEWPOINTS COMING 
IN...LOW TEMPS ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS SHOULD BE IN THE LOWER TO MID 
60S...WITH SOUTHERN AREAS IN THE UPPER 60S. DAYTIME MIXING TOMORROW 
SHOULD DROP DEWPOINTS INTO THE LOWER 60S AREA WIDE...WHICH SHOULD 
MAKE FOR A MORE COMFORTABLE DAY. 1000-850 THICKNESSES ARE A BIT 
LOWER TOMORROW...SO HIGH TEMPS SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY COOLER...IN THE 
MID 80S TO LOWER 90S. DRY MIDLEVEL AIR IN THE DEEP NW FLOW AND A 
STRONG CAPPING INVERSION AROUND 800 MB SHOULD PREVENT ANY CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT BEYOND JUST SCATTERED CU.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
WEAK COLD FRONT SHOULD RESIDE TO THE SOUTH OF THE REGION SUNDAY 
EVENING AND SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL 
ALLOW FOR LOWER TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S. CHANGES BEGIN TO RETURN 
MONDAY WITH MODELS SHOWING POSSIBLE MCS ACTIVITY OVER THE LOWER OHIO 
VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT AND THEN MOVING INTO MIDDLE TN MONDAY POSSIBLY 
REACHING EAST TN IN THE AFTERNOON MONDAY. RIGHT NOW HAVE HIGHEST 
RAIN CHANCES MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE ELSEWHERE. MAY HAVE TO RAISE POPS EVERYWHERE IF THIS 
SCENARIO LOOKS MORE LIKELY. COOL FRONT DISSIPATES BY MONDAY AND 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY INCREASES FROM THE NW STARTING MONDAY NIGHT 
REINFORCING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES AND CONTINUING 
THROUGH FRIDAY. A WEAK FRONT TO THE NORTH DOES NOT EVER MAKE IT 
SOUTH BUT THE NW FLOW ALOFT REGIME WILL KEEP FORECAST AREA IN PATH 
FOR DISTURBANCES MOVING THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH POSSIBLY A BREAK 
THURSDAY AND INCREASING AGAIN FRIDAY. RIDGING FROM THE WEST FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND SATURDAY MAY DECREASE THE RAIN CHANCES SOME IN THE 
SOUTHWEST BUT SHORTWAVE ENERGY STILL BRUSHES ACROSS THE NORTH. UPPER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
THROUGH TODAY.  FORCING DOES NOT LOOK IMPRESSIVE BUT CERTAINLY LOOKS 
LIKE ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR 
TODAY.  WILL GO DRY TONIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT.  WILL UNDERCUT GFS MOS 
TEMPS SLIGHTLY MOST AREAS TODAY...AND WILL BLEND IN A BIT OF THE 
HIGHER MET NUMBERS MOST AREAS FOR TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE PERIOD STARTS OUT DRY 
SUNDAY WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY JUST SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. BY 
MONDAY THE ATMOSPHERE INCREMENTALLY MOISTENS AND DESTABILIZES ENOUGH 
FOR CONVECTION TO FORM ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES SO WENT WITH A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP HERE WHILE OPTING TO KEEP THE GREAT VALLEY DRY. 
THE PREVAILING EASTERN U.S. LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL ACTUALLY DEEPEN A 
LITTLE DURING THE WORK WEEK AS MODELS SHOW SEVERAL VORTICITY MAXIMA 
SHIFTING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IN THE NEVER ENDING 
NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN ALOFT. CONVERGENCE OF MODEL SOLUTIONS STILL 
TARGET THE PERIOD TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY FOR THE BEST CHANCE OF 
CONVECTION WITH THE PASSAGE OF A COUPLE HEALTHY LOOKING SHORTER 
WAVELENGTH SYSTEMS. IN KEEPING WITH HOLDING A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE 
MEX MOS GUIDANCE POPS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF A SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY AS 
WELL AS ANOTHER VORT OR TWO PROGRESSING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION...STAYED WITH A LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. STAYED CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE TEMPS SUNDAY AND MONDAY AND TWEAKED MAXES BACK SLIGHTLY 
DURING MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM. WENT RELATIVELY CLOSE 
TO MINS EXCEPT OVER NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...SOUTHERN AREAS WILL 
HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS BOTH K AND 
LIFTED INDICIES INDICATE PLENTY OF INSTABILITY TO BE HAD THERE. 
ONGOING PRECIP IS OCCURRING AHEAD OF A MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH...AND SATELLITE INDICATES DRYING WILL ENTER THE AREA THROUGH 
THE EVENING BEHIND THE TROUGH AXIS. A DRY PERIOD FROM MIDNIGHT TO 
ABOUT 4AM IS EXPECTED...THEN A SECOND TROUGH WILL APPROACH THE AREA 
FROM THE NORTHWEST. MODELS SHOW A VORT MAX CROSSING NORTHERN AREAS 
SATURDAY MORNING TO EARLY AFTERNOON...WITH THE JET ENTRANCE REGION 
LOCATED OVER WV. THE NAM IS MORE BULLISH ON POPS WITH THIS TROUGH 
THAN THE DRIER GFS...BUT THE NAM IS SUPPORTED BY THE CANADIAN AND 
THE SREF. WHILE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL BE MORE LIMITED 
TOMORROW WITH THIS TROUGH COMPARED TO TODAY...CHANCE POPS SEEM 
REASONABLE ACROSS THE NORTH WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE CENTRAL. THE TROUGH 
AXIS/SURFACE FRONT SHOULD MOVE JUST EAST OF OUR AREA BY 00Z SUN.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
AS COOL FRONT SETTLES JUST EAST AND SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA 
SATURDAY NIGHT SATURDAYS SHOWER ACTIVITY SHOULD SHIFT INTO NORTH GA 
AND WESTERN NC BY EVENING. SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR MASS WILL REMAIN OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY AND WILL KEEP RAIN OUT. THE WESTERN HOT 
RIDGE WILL BE CENTERED FAR TO THE WEST AND IF ANY WEAK DISTURBANCES 
MOVE DOWN FROM THE NW ISOLATED STORMS MAY HAVE TO BE INTRODUCED IN 
LATER FORECASTS. NOT MUCH CHANGE IN HIGH TEMPERATURES AS DRIER AIR 
MASS AND SUNSHINE SHOULD WARM TEMPERATURES BACK TO MID 80S NORTH TO 
LOWER 90S SOUTH. LOWS SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY WILL HOWEVER DROP 
INTO THE 60S TO NEAR 70 AT CHA. WEAK DISTURBANCES IN NW FLOW ALOFT 
MONDAY COULD SET OFF ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH BETTER 
CHANCE IN THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS. THEN LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY 
MORE SHORTWAVE ENERGY TO INCREASE CLOUDS AND THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS. 
ANOTHER WEAK FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY 
AS BERMUDA HIGH OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST BRINGS MOISTURE NORTH.  
SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS RETURN AS 
UPPER TROUGH STAYS OVER THE EASTERN STATES AND UPPER RIDGE STAYS 
WELL TO THE WEST. UPPER RIDGE TRIES TO BUILD WEST FRIDAY BUT KEPT 
CHANCE POPS IN FORECAST. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GUIDANCE WITH HIGHS 
UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S AND LOWS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S ONLY 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.   

UPPER TROUGH SETS UP MAKES PROGRESS FROM THE EASTERN LAKES AND MID 
SOUTH TO NEW ENGLAND AND MID ATLANTIC COAST BY 12Z SUNDAY. 
ATMOSPHERE DRIES OUT QUITE A BIT OVER MUCH OF THE AREA BUT SOME 
LINGERING DEEPER MOISTURE AND A WEAK SHORT WAVE MAY SPARK A SHOWER 
OR THUNDERSTORM OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE 
NORTH CAROLINA BORDER SO MAINTAINED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP HERE. 
NORTHWEST FLOW WITH DRY ADVECTION ON SUNDAY ALLOWS FOR A DRY DAY 
WITH SOME LOWER DEWPOINTS FOR A CHANGE. GRADUALLY RAISE POPS THROUGH 
THE WORK WEEK AS MODELS REVEAL NUMEROUS SHORT WAVELENGTH TROUGHS 
MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IN THE PREVAILING 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW COMPLIMENTS OF THE PERSISTENT LONG WAVE TROUGH 
OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WHILE LOW LEVELS MOISTEN A BIT ON A RETURN 
WESTERLY FLOW. WENT WITH HIGHEST POP FOR CONVECTION ON TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH MODELS INDICATING AN MCS OR TWO DROPPING INTO THE 
AREA DURING THIS PERIOD. RAISED PROBABILITY TO LOW CHANCE ON 
THURSDAY WITH MEX MOS GUIDANCE HANGING ONTO A POP ALMOST 20

.SHORT TERM...
A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BE MOVING THROUGH THE WLY TO NWLY MID
LEVEL FLOW THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO THE AREA. WOULD EXPECT STORMS TO
DEVELOP ON THE PLATEAU AND MOVE EWD OUT INTO THE VALLEY DURING THE
AFTERNOON...DUE TO THE STEERING FLOW AS WELL AS THE PUSH FROM THE
DISTURBANCE. THIS DISTURBANCE IS NOT EASILY DISCERNED...BUT CAN BE
INFERRED THROUGH MID LEVEL RH ORIENTATION AND SREF PRECIP
ORIENTATION.

MODELS AGREE ON WEAK WAVE HAVING ENOUGH ORGANIZATION TO POTENTIALLY 
DEVELOP A LINE OF CONVECTION...THAT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA TO THE 
ESE. SREF SUPPORTS THIS IDEA...AND HAS VERY GOOD CONFIDENCE POPS FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON...SAGGING FARTHER AND FARTHER SOUTH WITH WAVE.

SEVERE THREAT EXPECTED TO BE RELATIVELY WEAK...MAINLY LIMITED TO 
ISOLATED DAMAGING DOWNDRAFTS.  WIND SHEAR WILL BE WEAK...FOCUSED 
MORE TO THE NORTH...BUT MLCAPE VALUES WILL APPROACH 1500 J/KG SOUTH 
AND 1000 NORTH.  

WITH PRECIP MOVING OUT AND SKIES SLOWLY CLEARING TONIGHT...HAD 
THOUGHT FOG MIGHT BE A THREAT...HOWEVER...FEEL THAT FOG WILL BE 
PRETTY LIMITED OVERALL AS PRE-FRONTAL SOUTHWEST WINDS MAY KEEP 
THINGS STIRRED UP ENOUGH PREVENT SIGNIFICANT FOG...SO WILL LEAVE THE 
MENTION OF IT OUT.

WENT A COUPLE OF DEGREES COOLER THAN GUIDANCE ON HIGH TEMPS 
TODAY...THINKING THAT CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURE WILL BE MET AT A LOW 
ENOUGH TEMPERATURE TO KEEP THINGS FROM GETTING QUITE AS HOT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WEAK COOL FRONT SLIPS 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY AS UPPER TROUGH MAKES PROGRESS 
FROM THE EASTERN LAKES AND MID SOUTH TO NEW ENGLAND AND MID ATLANTIC 
COAST BY 12Z SUNDAY. ATMOSPHERE DRIES OUT QUITE A BIT OVER MUCH OF 
THE AREA BUT SOME LINGERING DEEPER MOISTURE AND A WEAK SHORT WAVE 
MAY SPARK A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE

THINK THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE WITH WEAK WIND SHIFT BOUNDARY
CONTINUING TO DRIFT EASTWARD. DON'T KNOW IF THIS BOUNDARY WILL
SUSTAIN ITSELF WELL ENOUGH TO SHOW A WIND SHIFT OF ANY KIND AT TAF
SITES...OR IF IT WILL HOLD TOGETHER WELL ENOUGH TO BE A FOCUS FOR
STORMS DURING DAYTIME HEATING. HOWEVER...IF THE BOUNDARY KEEPS ITS
PRESENT PACE IT WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA BEFORE DAYTIME HEATING
BEGINS...MOVING INTO NC PRIOR TO 12Z.

SMALL AREA OF SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER N GA...NEEDS TO BE WATCHED.
MODELS SHOW THIS AREA CONTINUING OVERNIGHT...SWELLING TO NE AND
MOVING TO THE E OR NE...SO IT WOULD MAINLY THREATEN KCHA. CLOUD TOP
TEMPS HOLDING PRETTY COLD AND WESTERN EDGE ON SATL IMAGES KEEPS
DEVELOPING...SO HAVE VCTS COMMENT OVERNIGHT FOR KCHA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
THE RIDGE THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE AREA THE PAST FEW DAYS IS MOVING
EAST...AND A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL BE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE AREA
THROUGH FRIDAY. A WESTERLY FLOW FROM 925-700 MB WILL PREVENT DEEP
MOISTURE FROM ADVECTING INTO THE AREA...AND FORCING FOR LIFT WILL
BE WEAK. THUNDERSTORMS THAT ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT OVER KY WILL
LIKELY WEAKEN. THUS POPS FOR LATE TONIGHT AND FRIDAY WILL
BE IN THE CHANCE RANGE...WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES NORTH FRIDAY
MORNING...THEN SHIFTING TO THE SOUTH IN THE LATE AFTERNOON.
INSTABILITY LOOKS SUFFICIENT FOR A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE STORMS ON
FRIDAY. THE NAM AND GFS SHOW A SECOND VORT MAX APPROACHING NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT THE GFS DOES NOT PRODUCE
MUCH OF ANY PRECIP WITH IT. WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP NORTH
THROUGH THE NIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
MODELS BRING A WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY
MORNING. THE PRE FRONTAL CONVECTION SHOULD BE THROUGH THE FORECAST
AREA. A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED WITH THE FRONT
SATURDAY MORNING. DRIER AIRMASS BEHIND THE FRONT WILL KEEP MOST OF
THE FORECAST ARE DRY. HOWEVER LINGERING MOISTURE IN THE MOUNTAINS
MAY BE ENOUGH FOR ISOLATED STORMS LATER IN THE DAY SO KEPT SLIGHT
CHANCE ALONG THE MOUNTAINS. SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT DRY
AS FRONT MOVES SOUTH TO NEAR GULF COAST AND NW FLOW KEEPS DRIER
FLOW OVER THE REGION. THIS WILL AFFECT MAINLY LOWS SATURDAY NIGHT
AND SUNDAY NIGHT. LOWS WILL BE MOSTLY 60S. HIGHS SATURDAY UPPER 80S
TO LOWER 90S AND SUNDAY MID 80S TO LOWER 90S. NW FLOW PATTERN
PERSISTS MONDAY AND WITH WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING SE INTO THE
FORECAST AREA ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE. FROM
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY UPPER RIDGE STAYS CENTERED TO THE WEST.
ALSO COOL FRONT TO THE SOUTH DISSIPATES ALLOWING FOR WINDS TO
SWITCH DIRECTION BRINGING MORE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE NORTH. AT THE
SAME TIME SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVES DOWN FROM THE NW INCREASING
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AND REINFORCING THE UPPER
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT OBSERVATIONS AND SATELLITE
INDICATING PATCHY FOG OVER THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE CWA AND
ALSO THE MOUNTAINS. NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO MENTION IN THE
FORECAST SINCE IT SHOULD DISSIPATE AROUND SUNRISE. OTHERWISE...A
HOT AND DRY DAY IS EXPECTED TODAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABOVE NORMAL AGAIN. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES
LOOKED REASONABLE FOR TODAY SO STAYED CLOSE. A FRONT APPROACHING
THE REGION TONIGHT BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
WILL CONTINUE WITH THE HIGHEST PRECIPITATION CHANCES FOR THE
WESTERN COUNTIES AND AFTER MIDNIGHT. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED
REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT AS WELL...SO STAYED CLOSE AGAIN.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED
PERIOD...AND REVEAL A FAIRLY STRONG (FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR) UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH PUSHING A WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA
SATURDAY MORNING. PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION AHEAD OF THIS FRONTAL
BOUNDARY WILL LIKELY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY
MORNING...WITH ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT EXPECTED ON
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO
DEVELOP. THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ALSO BEGINS TO AMPLIFY OVER THE
OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...SO WILL PLAN TO
MENTION LIKELY POPS FOR FRIDAY. THIS WEAK COLD FRONT SHOULD FINALLY
MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY MORNING...BUT WILL ONLY
MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS DUE TO THE TIMING OF THE FRONT WHICH
PREVENTS MUCH DAYTIME HEATING FOR CONVECTION. IT APPEARS THAT THIS
COLD FRONT WILL NOT BRING MUCH OF A DROP IN TEMPS BEHIND
IT...EXCEPT FOR LOWER MINS AT NIGHT DUE TO THE SLIGHTLY LOWER
DEWPOINTS IN THE DRIER AIR MASS. NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THEN LINGERS
OVER THE FORECAST AREA INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...WHICH COULD CAUSE
SOME ORGANIZED CONVECTIVE CLUSTERS OVER THE MID MS OR LOWER OHIO
RIVER VALLEYS TO SNEAK INTO THE FORECAST AREA. FOR NOW...WILL
CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR SUNDAY DUE TO THE FRONTAL
PASSAGE...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT WHEN
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY BEGIN TO INCREASE AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING
WARM FRONT. THIS WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT INTO THE
FORECAST AREA FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...BRINGING A SLIGHTLY
BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE POPPED UP IN SW VA. MUCH OF THE AREA 
REMAINS CAPPED THIS AFTERNOON...AND COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN 
ISOLATED THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON...WITH ANY SHOWERS 
DISSIPATING BY SUNSET. WILL NOT CARRY ANY POPS FOR THE FIRST 
PERIOD...BUT WILL MENTION ISOLATED SHOWERS NORTH IN A PRE-FIRST 
PERIOD. PATCHY FOG COULD DEVELOP NORTH WHERE GROUND MOISTURE IS 
HIGHER FROM RAINFALL LAST NIGHT AND DEWPOINTS ARE HOLDING IN THE 
LOWER 70S. 

ON THURSDAY A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE CROSSING THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION...WITH HIGH PRESSURE LOCATED OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF 
MEXICO. THE RESULTING PRESSURE GRADIENT SHOULD BRING SW WINDS OF 
10-15 MPH TOMORROW AFTERNOON. THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE AXIS TO OUR WEST 
TODAY WILL SHIFT EASTWARD TOMORROW...SO THE CAP IS EXPECTED TO 
CONTINUE TO HELP SUPPRESS CONVECTION TOMORROW AFTERNOON.  WITH HIGHS 
IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S AND DEWPOINTS AROUND 70...HEAT INDEX VALUES 
ARE EXPECTED TO REACH BETWEEN 100 AND 105 IN THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN TN VALLEY. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS FORECAST PERIOD A COLD FRONT IS HEADED TOWARD THE AREA...ALONG
WITH AN ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH. LOOKS LIKE THU NIGHT AND INTO
FRIDAY MORNING CONVECTION WILL BE MARCHING TOWARD THE AREA FROM THE
NORTHWEST. THE UPPER SUPPORT FOR THIS CONVECTION WILL BE WANING AND
THE CONVECTION WILL BE STRAYING PRETTY FAR AWAY FROM THE FRONT...SO
THINKING THAT CONVECTION WILL BE LIMPING INTO THE AREA AND MAY FADE
AS IT COMES OFF THE PLATEAU...LIKE WE SEE VERY OFTEN DURING THE
MORNING IN THESE SCENARIOS.

MODELS NOT IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON ACTUAL FRONTAL PASSAGE.  MODELS 
AGREE THAT FRONT WILL BE NW OF AREA AT 12Z FRIDAY AND BY 12Z SUNDAY 
THAT THE FRONT WILL BE S AND E OF THE AREA AND THE SURFACE RIDGE 
WILL BE BUILDING INTO THE AREA.  FOR SATURDAY...EVEN IF FRONT IS NOT 
QUITE THROUGH...SURFACE FLOW SHOULD BE VEERED AROUND ENOUGH THAT 
FOCUS WILL BE EAST OF MOUNTAINS...SO NOT THAT SIGNIFICANT WITH 
REGARD TO PRECIP...BUT MORE FOR MIN TEMPS...ONCE RIDGE BUILDS IN 
SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL DRY OUT A LITTLE AND ALLOW LOWER MIN TEMPS BY 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY MORNINGS.  SO GOING A LITTLE ABOVE GUIDANCE FOR 
MINS SATURDAY MORNING AND GUIDANCE LOOKS GOOD FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY 
MORNINGS.  

GOING WITH A DRY FORECAST ACROSS THE AREA UNTIL TUESDAY WHEN RETURN 
FLOW SHOULD GET THINGS UNSTABLE OVER THE PLATEAU...AND NW UPPER FLOW 
SHOULD AID IN BRINGING STORMS OVER THE VALLEY.

AROUND 20Z WITH STRONG AND GUSTY WIND AND A NICE DROP TO MVFR VSBY
IN MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN IN THUNDERSTORMS. THE ACTION WILL LIKELY
BE COMPLETE BY 22Z HERE WITH VICINITY THUNDER UNTIL 01Z. PLACED A
VICINITY THUNDER AT 22Z AT TYS BUT AM NOT CONVINCED HOW FAR
SOUTHWEST CONVECTION WILL FIRE IN SUPPRESSED ENVIRONMENT ACROSS
MUCH OF CENTRAL EAST AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. APPLIED SOME LOW END
MVFR REDUCTION IN VSBY IN FOG AT TRI FROM EXPECTED RAIN. KEPT VFR

.DISCUSSION...CONVECTION CURRENTLY BUILDING SOUTHEAST ACROSS
EASTERN KENTUCKY AND ADVANCING TOWARD SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. AIR MASS
HAS NOT HAD TIME TO FULLY DESTABILIZE IN THIS AREA SO STORM
INTENSITY SHOULD STAY IN CHECK. HOWEVER...BY EARLY AFTERNOON LOW
LEVELS WILL HAVE WARMED NICELY INTO THE LOW TO MID 80S HERE. THE
MAIN EVENT WITH SEVERE CONVECTION WILL MOST LIKELY OCCUR LATER IN
THE AFTERNOON AROUND 20-21Z AS MCS CURRENTLY ACROSS NORTHERN
INDIANA SHOULD STRENGTHEN INTO AN EAST TO WEST LINE ENCOUNTERING
MODERATE TO HIGH INSTABILITY AS IT BUILDS SOUTH TOWARD THE OHIO
RIVER. CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD BUT WILL ADJUST POPS A LITTLE
HIGHER WITH ONGOING CONVECTION. WARMER TEMPS ON TRACK TODAY WITH
INTENSE HEATING UNDERWAY IN NEARLY CLOUD FREE ENVIRONMENT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES REGION... 
WHICH WAS TRIGGERING A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX OVER SOUTHERN MN 
THIS MORNING. THIS MCS IS PROGGED TO MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY TODAY...WITH A VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP AHEAD OF IT BY THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT THIS 
MCS WILL LIKELY INTENSIFY THIS AFTERNOON AS ITS SOUTHERN EDGE MOVES

A DERECHO WITH WIDESPREAD DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. 
WILL PLAN TO MENTION THESE POSSIBILITIES IN THE ZONE FORECASTS AND 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK 
REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT ON 
WEDNESDAY BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM WITH THE 
HIGHEST CHANCES OVER THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA. A TROUGH 
TRACKING THROUGH THE REGION ON THURSDAY BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE OF  
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
HOURS. A FRONTAL BOUNDARY PUSHES INTO THE REGION ON FRIDAY PROVIDING 
A BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE AREA. THE GFS 
IS FASTER THAN THE ECMWF IN PUSHING THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE 
SOUTH ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...WILL GO WITH CONTINUITY AND KEEP THE 
LOW CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION FOR THE WEEKEND. ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...APPARENTLY TOO MUCH WARM AIR IS 
PRESENT ALOFT FOR MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. STORMS 
GET ENOUGH BOOST ON THE TERRAIN BUT WEAKEN OVER THE GREAT VALLEY. 
THERE STILL COULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR ISOLATED COVERAGE ACROSS 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH SOMEWHAT BETTER CHANCE OVER SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THIS EVENING WITH TEMPERATURES 
WARMING WELL INTO THE UPPER 80S AND LOWER 90S AT MID AFTERNOON. 
TRIED TO BE MORE AGRESSIVE WITH POPS ON TUESDAY AS MODELS AGREE MORE 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL RIDE ALONG THE BACKSIDE OF THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY/SOUTHEAST U.S. UPPER RIDGE. ATMOSPHERE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENTLY 
UNSTABLE AGAIN WITH MORE THAN ADEQUATE MOISTURE AND INTENSE HEATING 
IN ADVANCE OF A COLD FRONT THAT SHOULD MAKE DECENT PROGRESS INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY BY EVENING. STORMS MAY ALSO BECOME ORGANIZED WITH 
STRONGER UPPER LEVEL FLOW BUILDING IN WITH TIGHTENING HEIGHT 
GRADIENT. SEVERE CONVECTION IS A POSSIBILITY IN THIS ENVIRONMENT. 
STAYED CLOSE TO BLEND OF MOS FOR TEMPERATURES.     

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WARM AND HUMID 
CONDITIONS CONTINUE EARLY IN THE PERIOD. HIGH PWAT VALUES AND 
SURFACE DEWPOINT IN THE 70S REMAIN IN PLACE. NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL BY THU. BROAD UPPER TROUGH TAKING SHAPE OVER 
THE NORTHEAST QUADRANT OF THE CONUS AND BY FRI WILL DIG SOUTH INTO 
THE TN VALLEY. BETTER THAN NORMAL PRECIPITATION CHANCES FAVOR AREA 
NEAR THE KY AND SW VA BORDERS EARLY IN THE PERIOD. ORGANIZED 
CONVECTION A GOOD BET FOR FRIDAY AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIDES S INTO 
THE AREA WITH SOME UPPER SUPPORT. UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVES THROUGH 
LATER FRIDAY EARLY SAT DRYING OUT THE LAYER. SURFACE DEW POINTS WILL 
LOWER INTO THE 60S MOST AREAS. PRECIPITATION CHANCES FALL TO BELOW

WILL AGAIN DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH THE 
GREATEST INSTABILITY LOCATED OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. 
UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS APPEAR TO BE WEAK...WITH YESTERDAY'S SURFACE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY PRETTY MUCH DISSIPATED. THUS...WILL ONLY MENTION 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MOST EVERYWHERE TODAY...WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
POPS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN WHERE HIGHER INSTABILITY AND 
A STRONGER MID-LEVEL WIND FLOW SHOULD ENCOURAGE A BETTER COVERAGE OF 
CONVECTION. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE 
FORECAST FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WITH TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO 
HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE 
ON THE RISE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AS A COUPLE OF MINOR UPPER-LEVEL 
DISTURBANCE ASSOCIATED WITH A STRONG STORM SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS 
EASTERN CANADA PASS TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF THE REGION. THE 
INCREASED LIFT FROM THESE SHORTWAVES WILL HELP TO KICK OFF SOME 
ORGANIZED ACTIVITY ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY/EASTERN KENTUCKY...WHICH 
WILL AT LEAST MAKE IT'S WAY INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF THE MRX CWA BY 
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS DURING THIS TIME FRAME. THIS 
ACTIVITY WILL ALSO COINCIDE WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED DIURNAL 
CONVECTION THAT SHOULD BE ABLE TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE REGION EACH DAY 
/GIVEN THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE PRESENT ACROSS THE REGION/. WITH VERY 
HIGH PWATS VALUES...THE THREAT FOR HEAVY RAINFALL WILL EXIST EACH 
DAY UNDERNEATH ANY STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP. PROGGED INSTABILITY 
PARAMETERS WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO LOCALLY 
SEVERE CONVECTION EACH DAY...WITH DAMAGING WIND GUSTS BEING THE 
PRIMARY THREAT GIVEN THE INVERTED-V SOUNDING PROFILES EXHIBITED BY 
FORECAST MODELS.

A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO SLIDE BACK 
TOWARD MIDDLE TENNESSEE BY THURSDAY...SQUASHING POPS SOMEWHAT AND 
CREATING THE POTENTIAL FOR WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 90S IN 
MANY AREAS /WITH SOME LOCATIONS ACROSS SE TENNESSEE REACHING THE 
UPPER 90S/. FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...MODELS ARE INDICATING ANOTHER 
COLD FRONT DROPPING SOUTH OUT OF THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND 
POTENTIALLY THROUGH THE AREA...BRINGING WITH IT A BETTER CHANCE FOR 
MORE WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORMS TO CLOSE OUT THE WORK WEEK. WHILE 
THERE ARE STILL SOME DIFFERENCES IN TIMING...GUIDANCE IS BEGINNING 
TO SHOW SOME CONTINUITY OF THE GREATEST POTENTIAL BEING FRIDAY INTO 
FRIDAY NIGHT...BEFORE THINGS BEGIN TO TAPER OFF ON SATURDAY. GIVEN 
THIS...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO 40-50 PERCENT AREAWIDE DURING THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CONVECTION CONTINUES TO BE
CONFINED TO ALONG THE TN/KY AND TN/VA LINE THIS AFTERNOON. THIS
CONVERGENCE IS EITHER ASSOCIATED WITH REMNANTS OF WEAK SURFACE
FRONT OR WEAK TROUGH AT 850 MBS. DECENT COVERAGE OF GENERALLY WEAK 
TSRA ACROSS THIS AREA...SO I OPTED FOR A LATE AFTERNOON PERIOD WITH
CHANCE POPS SW VA/NE TN.

LATER TONIGHT...EXPECT THIS CONVECTION TO BE DIMINISHING WITH
POTENTIAL FOR PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT...AS ANY AREAS OF CONVECTIVE
DEBRIS CLOUDS DISSIPATE. A MOS BLEND OF MINS WAS VERY CLOSE TO
PERSISTENCE FOR LOWS. 

MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY CERTAINLY LINGERS AGAIN MONDAY...BUT OTHER
THAN OROGRAPHIC LIFT...NOT SURE HOW MUCH TSRA POPS UP BY THE
AFTERNOON HOURS. PREVIOUS POP/WX GRIDS WERE REASONABLE AND IN LINE
WITH NWS NEIGHBORS...SO JUST MINOR TWEAKS STAYING WITHIN 20 TO 30
PERCENT RANGE FOR NOW. OUR GROUND HAS BECOME QUITE MOIST GIVEN THE
GENEROUS RAINFALL SO FAR FOR THE MONTH OF JULY...AND WE HAVE SEEN
TEMPS STRUGGLE TO REACH THE WARMER MOS HIGHS EACH DAY. THUS...I CUT
MONDAY HIGHS BACK AT LEAST A COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW GFS MOS
ACROSS THE BOARD.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED
WITH THE EXTENDED FORECAST THINKING. BEING ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF
AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP THINGS ON THE
WARMER-THAN-NORMAL SIDE FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. WE WILL
PROBABLY DO BATTLE AT TIMES WITH MCS ACTIVITY DROPPING SOUTHEAST
OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY...MORE LIKELY FOCUSSING ON SW VA AND
ADJACENT AREAS. STILL LOOKS LIKE ONE OR TWO ROUNDS IN THE TUES/WED
TIME FRAME...THEN ONCE AGAIN DURING THE LATE-WEEK TIME FRAME. MODEL
DISCREPANCIES CAST A SHADOW OF UNCERTAINTY OVER THE LATE WEEK
OPPORTUNITY...SO WILL GENERALLY CARRY POPS FOR FRI AT A 30-50 PCT
RANGE...THEN 20-40 PCT FOR SAT.

THE SW PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA /CHATTANOOGA REGION/ WILL BE
SOMEWHAT TUCKED AWAY FROM THE PROJECTED STORM FLOW...WE'LL SEE...
THUS A BIT HOTTER THERE WITH MORE OF A POPCORN TSTM REGIME CAN BE
EXPECTED THERE.

.DISCUSSION...STRAY MORNING SHOWERS PASSING NE JUST ABOUT OUT OF THE 
NE TIP OF TN. FRONTAL BOUNDARY TOO DIFFUSE TO EVEN NOTE ANY MORE...
AND THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS IS NOW WELL OFF TO OUR ESE. 12Z OHX 
AND RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW SOME MID AND UPPER LEVEL DRYING...BUT STILL 
LOTS OF PRECIPITABLE WATER LINGERS (JUST ABOVE OR BELOW 1.5 INCHES).

SLIGHT CHANCE POPS LOOK GOOD FOR TODAY AND ALSO HIGHS A FEW DEGREES 
BELOW THE WARMER MOS NUMBERS. FORECAST IN GREAT SHAPE...BUT PLAN TO 
FRESHEN HOURLY GRIDS IN A LATE MORNING UPDATE.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY
GENERALLY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAIN/PLATEAU RANGE...WITH A VERY
MOIST AIR MASS STILL LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS
INDICATE THAT A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP OVER THE
FORECAST AREA AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON... BUT SOME UPPER-LEVEL
SUBSIDENCE SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT THE COVERAGE OF CONVECTION.
THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION ONLY ISOLATED CONVECTION FOR TODAY AND
TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO GENERALLY FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE
FORECAST WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT...AND WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER
WITH MAXES FOR TODAY SINCE IT APPEARS THAT THE MOIST GROUND HAS
KEPT TEMPS A LITTLE COOLER THAN GUIDANCE LATELY.

.LONG TERM /TOMORROW THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT/...
AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN IS EXPECTED DURING THE UPCOMING WEEK...AS 
REASONABLE CHANCES FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL EXIST AS A 
SERIES OF UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION IN 
RESPONSE TO A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH EASTERN 
CANADA AND NEW ENGLAND. GIVEN THE VERY WARM AND MOIST AIRMASS 
PRESENT UNDERNEATH A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE SITUATED TO THE NORTHWEST OF 
THE AREA...THE ENHANCED LIFT FROM THESE PASSING SHORT-WAVES WILL 
HELP TO TRIGGER OFF SOME SCATTERED CLUSTERS OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS /IN ADDITION TO ANY ACTIVITY GENERATED FROM DIURNAL 
HEATING/. THE BEST CHANCES MAY BE INITIALLY ON TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...SLIGHTLY FAVORING NE TENNESSEE AND SW VIRGINIA WHERE THE 
BEST LIFT WILL BE. THEN LATE IN THE WEEK...MODELS ARE HINTING AT 
ANOTHER COLD FRONT DROPPING SOUTH OUT OF THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY TOWARD THE REGION...WHICH WOULD INCREASE STORM COVERAGE AND  
CHANCES QUITE A BIT HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND AS MORE ORGANIZED 
CONVECTION DROPS SOUTH INTO THE REGION. HOWEVER...ATTM MODELS ARE 
DIFFERING WITH THE TIMING AND LOCATION OF THIS FRONT...SO HAVE HELD 
OFF ON MAKING ANY DRAMATIC CHANCES IN POPS LATE IN THE PERIOD. 

GIVEN THE HIGH PWAT VALUES...THE THREAT FOR VERY HEAVY RAINFALL
WILL EXIST EACH DAY UNDERNEATH ANY STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP. PROGGED
INSTABILITY PARAMETERS ALSO SUPPORT THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO
LOCALLY SEVERE CONVECTION EACH DAY...WITH DAMAGING WIND GUSTS BEING
THE PRIMARY THREAT GIVEN THE INVERTED-V SOUNDING PROFILES EXHIBITED
BY MODELS. THE ONLY OTHER FORECAST CONCERN OF NOTE WILL BE FAIRLY
WARM TEMPERATURES OVER THE COURSE OF THE WEEK AS THE AFOREMENTIONED
UPPER-RIDGE SLOWLY MOVES BACK TOWARD MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THIS WILL
RESULT IN INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT AND THUS
WARMER HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW TO MID 90S IN MANY AREAS. GIVEN
THE MOIST AIR MASS...LOCATIONS THAT DO NOT EXPERIENCE COOLING FROM
CONVECTION COULD SEE HEAT INDEX VALUES APPROACH 100 DEGREES...
ESPECIALLY ALONG THE CORRIDOR BETWEEN KNOXVILLE AND CHATTANOOGA.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...TWO AREAS OF CONVECTION THIS
AFTERNOON WITH INITIAL AREA LIKELY DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THE UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH (TSRA MOVING NE INTO CENTRAL VALLEY AND ACROSS THE
SMOKIES)...AND ALSO WHERE WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WAS NOTED
ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THINK THIS ACTIVITY WILL
STAY ISOLATED OVER NRN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA...SO RAN SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS NORTH TO CHANCE SOUTH FOR THE EVENING. KEEPING A SLIGHT
CHANCE POP AFTER MIDNIGHT WITH PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING WHERE SOME
PARTIAL CLEARING OCCURRS. NEXT SHIFT MIGHT BE ABLE TO DROP POPS
AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND CONSIDER IF FOG IS NEEDED ELSEWHERE.

FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A BIT OF MID TO UPR LEVEL DRYING AND MOS
POPS HAVE FALLEN FOR SUNDAY...WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE BEHIND PASSAGE
OF SHORTWAVE TROUGH AXIS. THUS...I OPTED TO LOWER POPS BACK TO 20
TO 30 PERCENT RANGE. THIS ALSO SUPPORTS GOING A LITTLE WARMER THAN
PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID FOR SUNDAY...BUT STAYED BELOW GFS MOS DUE TO
GFS BEING TOO WARM OVER PAST FEW DAYS. PERSISTENCE ON MIN TEMPS
SEEMED BEST CHOICE AND NOT AS COOL AS GFS MINS.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WE WILL GENERALLY
FIND OURSELVES ON THE NORTHEAST EDGE OF AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OF
HIGH PRESSURE FOR MOST OF THE PERIOD. AT LEAST WE SHOULD SEE A
MINIMIZING OF CONVECTION THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON THANKS TO DRIER
AIR ASSOCIATED WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLOWLY MAKING ITS WAY DOWN.
DRIER DEWPOINTS ARE CURRENTLY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND THESE WILL
HAVE SOME IMPACT HERE DURING THE OPENING DAYS OF THE NEW WEEK. BY
TUES NIGHT/WED...THE STORM PATH MAY ALLOW A RETURN OF MORE
ORGANIZED CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS INTO THE NE PORTION OF THE FORECAST
AREA. THE SW PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA /CHATTANOOGA REGION/ MAY
HAVE TO RELY ON MORE OF A POPCORN TSTM REGIME AS IT WILL BE CLOSER
TO THE HOT HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE. THE NEXT MAIN WEATHER MAKER FOR THE
REGION MAY COME INTO PLAY LATE IN THE WEEK.

BUT THINK THAT MAXES SHOULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...AN ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN 
IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...THANKS TO A DEEPENING 
UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. AS A

BE BTWN 1.7-2.0 INCHES/. IN ADDITION...INVERTED-V SOUNDINGS SUGGEST 
A POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS WITH THE STRONGEST 
ACTIVITY. WHILE THE POTENTIAL FOR DIURNALLY INDUCED CONVECTION WILL 
EXIST EACH DAY...THE SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCES FOR THE GREATEST AMOUNT 
OF STORM COVERAGE APPEAR TO BE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WHEN INCREASED 
LIFT FROM A COUPLE OF UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVES PUSH OVER THE AREA. IN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...AIRMASS HAS BECOME QUITE
UNSTABLE FROM W/MID TN NE ACROSS KY...BUT STILL MORE STABLE ACROSS
NE PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA DUE TO LINGERING CLOUD COVER.
CONVERGENCE NOW NOTED ALONG THE WEAK COLD FRONT...PLUS MORE
DEVELOPMENT AHEAD OF THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH. THIS ACTIVITY LOOKS
POISED TO TRACK S TO SE ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING AND
OVERNIGHT. CARRIED LIKELY POPS FOR NRN PLATEAU AND EXTREME SW VA
BEFORE 21/00Z...THEN LOW END OF LIKELY POPS ELSEWHERE TONIGHT.
THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS LOOKS DIMINISHED...BUT LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS
MAY OCCUR (ALTHOUGH STEERING WINDS HAVE INCREASED).

WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY BECOMES QUITE DIFFUSE OVER THE WEEKEND...AND
UPPER TROUGH AXIS WILL MOVE THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS BY SATURDAY
NIGHT. LINGERING MOISTURE...DAYTIME HEATING AND NW FLOW ALOFT WILL
MAKE IT NECESSARY TO CARRY POPS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. MODELS AND MOS
SUGGEST POPS TAPERING FROM LOWER NORTH TO HIGHER SOUTH...WHICH
LOOKS REASONABLE. 

MOS MINS LOOK TOUGH TO DISAGREE WITH...FAVORING COOLER MOS MAXES
SATURDAY...THEN A BLEND OF MOS FOR SUNDAY HIGHS.
 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...IT LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER 
RELATIVELY ACTIVE PERIOD AS A LONG WAVE TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN CANADA AND THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. IN THIS PATTERN 
NUMEROUS UPPER LEVEL FEATURES WILL DROP SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL BE 
PRESENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE 
REGION WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. BY 
FRIDAY UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL NUDGE THE TROUGH TO THE NORTHEAST 
WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR A LOWER CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION AS 
THE ATMOSPHERE DRIES OUT AN STABILITY INCREASES. STAYED CLOSE TO MOS 
MAX TEMPS EARLY AND THEN ADJUSTED DOWN A DEGREE OR TWO DURING THE 
MORE ACTIVE MIDDLE PORTION OF THE WEEK.

951 AM EDT FRI JUL 20 2012

.DISCUSSION...REMNANTS OF MCC THIS MORNING WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS 
STILL AFFECTING PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. AIRMASS VERY MUCH 
STABILIZED BEHIND THIS ACTIVITY...SO STRONGER CONVECTION WILL BE 
DELAYED TODAY. MESO ANALYSIS SHOWS A GREAT AMOUNT OF NEGATIVE 
BUOYANCY TO BE OVERCOME...WITH A LOT CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS TO 
BREAK UP. 

12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW LOTS OF MOISTURE WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES STILL AROUND OR JUST BELOW 2 INCHES. WIND SHEAR WILL BE A BIT 
HIGHER THIS AFTERNOON...WITH FREEZING AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS 
STILL VERY HIGH. THUS...MAIN THREATS ARE WIND GUSTS AND LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINS. MAY DOWNPLAY THE DAMAGING WINDS SOMEWHAT...AS DAY ONE 
CONVECTIVE OUTLOOK HAS SHIFTED THE SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE AREA TO OUR 
SOUTH AND EAST. 

PLAN TO LOWER POPS FOR THE LATE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON PERIODS 
THEN TREND BACK TO LIKELY POPS. FRONTAL BOUNDARY JUST TO OUR NORTH 
AND THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH JUSTIFY KEEPING HIGH POPS. 

OTHERWISE...WILL FRESHEN HOURLY GRIDS AND CHECK MAX TEMP FORECAST
WHICH COULD BE AFFECTED BY MORNING CLOUDS AND LATER CONVECTION.

.AVIATION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH THE REMNANTS OF A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS INITIAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH THIS 
MORNING...WITH ADDITIONAL REDEVELOPMENT EXPECTED BY THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING AS THE LOCAL AIR MASS BECOMES MODERATELY TO POTENTIALLY 
HIGHLY UNSTABLE. SINCE TIMING THE EXACT OCCURRENCE OF ANY TSTORMS AT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH SOME PRE-FRONTAL 
CONVECTION WEAKENING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...WITH BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATING A VERY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT. IN ADDITION...PRECIPITABLE 
WATER VALUES ARE PROGGED TO BE VERY HIGH (BETWEEN 2 AND 2.2 INCHES) 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE STORMS WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL IN THE ZONES. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT...AND WILL COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS WITH MAXES FOR TODAY. THIS 
APPROACH WITH MAXES WILL YIELD TEMPS A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN 
YESTERDAY...WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE GIVEN THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN 
CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP COVERAGE FOR TODAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
AND ITS ASSOCIATED SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL PROVIDE SOME REASONABLY 
GOOD CHANCES FOR MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING STORMS ON SATURDAY 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ZONES AND THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS...BEFORE PULLING 
AWAY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN A SLIGHTLY 
DRIER FORECAST FOR SUNDAY GIVEN THE LACK OF UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT. A 
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BEGIN BUILDING BACK 
TOWARD THE AREA EARLY NEXT WEEK...INCREASING THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPS 
ALOFT WHICH WILL RESULT IN HIGHS RETURNING TO THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 
90S IN MANY LOCATIONS ONCE AGAIN. GIVEN THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE 
PRESENT UNDERNEATH THE RIDGE...CHANCES FOR SCATTERED DIURNAL 
CONVECTION WILL EXIST THROUGHOUT THE UPCOMING WEEK. MOST OF THE 
REGION WILL BE ON THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS RIDGE...WHICH WILL 
PROMOTE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. THIS WILL ALLOW ANY STORM 
COMPLEXES/MCS FEATURES THAT DEVELOP ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY TO POTENTIALLY DROP DOWN INTO THE REGION...ENHANCING 
THE THREAT FOR STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS. IN ADDITION...A SURFACE COLD 
FRONT IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE AREA ONCE AGAIN DURING THE MIDDLE 
PART OF NEXT WEEK...FURTHER INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR RAINFALL. 
MODELS ARE SHOWING FAIRLY GOOD QPF SIGNALS WITH THIS ACTIVITY...SO 
HAVE INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY TO SOLID CHANCE POPS DURING THE DAY FOR 
MOST THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST. GIVEN PWAT VALUES PROGGED TO BE 
BTWN 1.5-2.0 INCHES ACROSS THE AREA...THE BIGGEST THREATS WITH THESE 
STORMS WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND SOME MINOR FLOODING 
CONCERNS WHERE TRAINING OCCURS. ADDITIONALLY...INVERTED-V SOUNDING 
PROFILES AND THE INSTABILITY PARAMETERS IN PLACE ALSO INDICATE A 
POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS AND PERHAPS SOME LOW-END 
SEVERE HAIL WITH THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...LATE AFTERNOON OR PRE
20/00Z GRIDS MAINTAIN LIKELY POPS ACROSS SW VA AND A BIT OF THE NRN
PLATEAU COUNTIES. AN MCS IS DEVELOPING OVER SE PARTS OF THE OHIO
VALLEY AND COULD CLIP SW VA EARLY THIS EVENING. SPOTTY TSRA POPPING
OUT AHEAD OF THE MCS WHILE LITTLE DEVELOPMENT ELSEWHERE. STAYED
CLOSE TO GFS MOS POPS FOR TONIGHT WITH GENERALLY 50 PERCENT ACROSS
THE BOARD. MOS BLEND LOOKED GREAT FOR MIN TEMP.

WEAK FRONT DRAWS CLOSE FRIDAY AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES AND
THEN MOVES ACROSS FRIDAY NIGHT. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED GOOD
FOR THESE PERIODS WITH JUST A MINOR TWEAK OR TWO. ALSO KEPT THE
DECREASING POPS FROM THE NORTH ON SATURDAY. INCREASING WINDS ALOFT
AND MOIST AIRMASS CREATE A THREAT OF A FEW SEVERE STORMS FRIDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS AND WIND GUSTS
GREATER THAN 50 MPH THE MAIN THREATS. FREEZING LEVEL HEIGHTS DROP
SO POSSIBLY SOME HAIL UP TO AN INCH OR SO IN DIAMATER. THIS IS
MENTIONED ALREADY IN OUR HWO PRODUCT.

OTHERWISE...MOS GUIDANCE WAS QUITE CLOSE AND REASONABLE FOR FRIDAY
THROUGH SATURDAY...AS WELL AS CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS. I MAY SEND
THE ZFPMRX PRODUCT OUT AGAIN WITH A PRE-FIRST PERIOD TO BETTER
ACCOUNT FOR STORMS APPROACHING SW VA. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SATURDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION DECREASES TO SOME 
DEGREE AS AN UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE BOUNDARY GRADUALLY SLIP AWAY 
FROM THE FORECAST AREA. IN THIS CONFIGURATION THERE WILL ONLY BE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF A THUNDERSTORM OVER MUCH OF THE REGION WITH A LOW 
CHANCE PROBABILITY OVER THE HIGH TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER. THE PERIOD MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WILL BECOME MORE ACTIVE 
ONCE AGAIN AS SEVERAL SHORTWAVES/MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS BUILD 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IN THE PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW 
WITHIN THE EASTERN U.S. LONGWAVE TROUGH. A SURFACE COOL FRONT SHOULD 
BE MAKING PROGRESS THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA 
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. USED HIGHER MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY WITH LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY MONDAY AND THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND A WEAK COLD FRONT LIES TO THE NORTH
FROM NJ ACROSS THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS. A
WARM MOIST AIR MASS CONTINUES ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. LEFT OVER CLOUD
DEBRIS FROM WEDNESDAYS THUNDERSTORMS WAS STILL DISSIPATING AND ONLY
LIGHT FOG HAD FORMED IN A FEW LOCATIONS. TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE
UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S AREA WIDE. BASIC PATTERN IS UNCHANGED FROM
WEDNESDAY WITH UPPER RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE ROCKIES AND FLOW
AROUND IT BRINGING WEAK DISTURBANCES SE IN NW FLOW. AS DAYTIME
HEATING COMMENCES SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AND MOVE
SLOWLY SOUTHEAST PRODUCING LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS...FREQUENT LIGHTNING
AND GUSTY WINDS. BEST SEVERE THREAT WILL BE NORTH OF REGION IN WV
AND KY SO ONLY ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS EXPECTED. ACTIVITY WILL
LIKELY DEVELOP FIRST ALONG OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM WEDNESDAY.
STORMS SHOULD DIE DOWN IN THE EVENING LIKE WEDNESDAY. ALSO TONIGHT
THE WEAK FRONT MOVES A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH AND NIGHT TIME ACTIVITY
TO THE SOUTH OF IT COULD MOVE INTO SW VA AND EXTREME NORTHERN TN BY
EARLY FRIDAY SO INCREASED POPS THERE LATE. WILL KEEP HIGHS TODAY A
DEGREE OR SO LOWER THAN WEDNESDAYS FORECAST CENTRAL AND SOUTH BASED
ON SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS AND ABOUT THE SAME NE TN AND SW VA.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO CURRENT 
FORECAST. ATTENTION MUST BE PAID TO FRI. HIGH MOISTURE 
CONTENT...PWAT VALUES NEAR 2.00 AND POTENTIAL ENERGY ...CAPES ARND 
2000 REMAIN IN PLACE EARLY. ONGOING CONVECTION WILL SEND BOUNDARIES 
INTO THE AREA FROM THE NW. SHEAR VALUES NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE BUT 
STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD BE EXPECTED WITH DAMAGING 
WINDS ALONG WITH LOCALIZED FLOODING THE MAIN THREATS. THE ACTIVITY 
MAY COME IN TWO FORMS EARLY DUE TO THE AFOREMENTIONED AND AGAIN FRI 
EVENING ALONG WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WHICH WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO 
THE AREA LATE FRIDAY WITH ADDITIONAL FORCING FROM SOME BACKSIDE 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY. MID LEVELS WILL DRY OUT SOME POST TROUGH FOR THE 
WEEKEND WITH SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY LINGERING ALONG EXTREME 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MOST CONVECTION WILL BE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE 
AREA SAT AND SUN. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND LAYER MOISTURE 
RETURN NEXT WEEK WITH BETTER THAN NORMAL PRECIPITATION CHANCES. 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES WILL LIKELY DEVELOP NEXT WEEK BUT STEERING 
SHOULD KEEP THEM NORTH OF THE AREA.

HAIL SO FAR HAS BEEN PEA TO DIME/NICKEL SIZE. 

CARRIED 30 TO 50 PERCENT POPS INTO THE EVENING WITH SCATTERED

AFTER MIDNIGHT...SIMILAR TO NAM MODEL DEPICTION. FRONTAL BOUNDARY
INITIALLY ON THURSDAY WILL BE A BIT NORTH OF SE KY/SW VA...BUT
ANY LEFT OVER SMALLER SCALE BOUNDARIES SHOULD LEAD TO LIKELY
COVERAGE BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS AGAIN. JUST MINOR CHANGES FOR
THURSDAY'S POP AND WEATHER GRIDS.

MOS MINS LOOKED IN LINE WITH PAST FEW NIGHT AND WERE CLOSELY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)... WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING AND A SURFACE TROUGH EAST OF
THE APPALACHIANS. A WARM A VERY HUMID AIR MASS CONTINUES ACROSS THE
EASTERN TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SINCE SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FELL ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION TUESDAY RAIN
COOLED AIR ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE MID 60S TO LOWER
70S ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. PATCHY FOG SOME LOCALLY DENSE HAS
FORMED THIS MORNING IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST AND CENTRAL
EAST TN AND THIS WILL CONTINUE UNTIL AROUND 13Z. WEAK VORTICITY
ADVECTION OVER SE KY AND SW VA MOVING INTO NE TN HAS CAUSED SHOWERS
TO DEVELOP ALREADY IN SE KY AND THEY SHOULD MOVE INTO NE TN AND SW
VA BEFORE SUNRISE. PATTERN SIMILAR TODAY TO TUESDAY WITH AIR MASS
BECOMING MODERATELY UNSTABLE. SO EXPECT PULSE TYPE STRONG TO A FEW
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP. HEAVY RAINFALL ALSO A POSSIBILITY
WITH SOME STORMS AS PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES REACH UP TO ABOUT
1.9 INCHES. LOCALIZED FLOODING POSSIBLE WITH SLOW MOVEMENT OF
STORMS. IT MAY TAKE A LITTLE LONGER FOR STRONGER STORMS TO DEVELOP
WITH COOLER MORNING LOWS AND PATCHY FOG AREAS ALLOWING A SLOWER
WARM UP. HIGHS UNIFORMLY MID 80S TO NEAR 90 EXCEPT LOWER 90S CHA.

.LONG TERM...THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER TROUGHING DIGS SE-S 
THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS THROUGH SAT AND WEAKENS IN PLACE THROUGH 
THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. THIS EFFECTIVELY BISECTS THE 
CONTINENTAL MID LEVEL RIDGE FROM THE BERMUDA HIGH. VERY MOIST AIR 
MASS WITH PW AROUND 2 INCHES...LIKELY POPS SEEM WARRANTED FOR 
THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL CERTAINLY BE A CONCERN 
BOTH DAYS...AND WITH CAPE AROUND 2000 J/KG...ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS 
MAY ALSO BE POSSIBLE. A WEAK FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH MRX CWA FRIDAY 
AND LINGER NEAR SOUTHERN PART OF CWA THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE 
PERIOD. TEMPS AND DEW POINTS CHANGE LITTLE NORTH OF FRONT BUT LAYER 
DOES BECOME A BIT DRIER...YET STILL ABOVE NORMAL. CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION DECREASES TO NEAR NORMAL SUNDAY AND MONDAY BUT TRENDS 
WETTER INTO NEXT MID WEEK.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TOMORROW/...
SCATTERED STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO
DEVELOP IN A WARM...MOIST AND FAIRLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS THIS
AFTERNOON. MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE EXHIBITING A CLASSIC INVERTED-V
SHAPE AND ARE INDICATING CAPE VALUES AOA 2000-3000 J/KG AND LIFTED
INDEX VALUES AT -5C...ALONG WITH PWATS OF BTWN 1.5-1.8 INCHES.
THUS...THE THREAT FOR DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS...HAIL AND
PARTICULARLY LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL EXIST WITH ANY STORMS THAT
DO DEVELOP THROUGH THIS EVENING. WIND SHEAR VALUES ARE FAIRLY
UNIMPRESSIVE...SO THE STORM MODE SHOULD GENERALLY BE PULSE-TYPE
CONVECTION AND VERY OUTFLOW BOUNDARY DRIVEN GIVEN THE LACK OF
UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT. THIS ACTIVITY WILL BEGIN TO WANE WITH THE LOSS
OF DAYTIME HEATING...THOUGH SOME ACTIVITY MAY LINGER ALONG THE
HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS THROUGH MIDNIGHT OR SO. WITH CALM
WINDS...SOME CLEARING CONDITIONS AND A VERY MOIST BOUNDARY
LAYER...PATCHY FOG IS ONCE AGAIN EXPECTED LATE TONIGHT
/PARTICULARLY IN AREAS NEAR BODIES OF WATER/.

FOR TOMORROW...ANY LINGERING FOG WILL DISSIPATE AFTER SUNRISE...BUT
THE THREAT FOR ADDITIONAL CONVECTION WILL EXIST AREAWIDE. AN UPPER-
LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL STILL BE THE DOMINANT SYNOPTIC SCALE
FEATURE IN THE REGION...BUT GIVEN THE VERY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS
/COMBINED WITH LINGERING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES AND A COLD FRONT
BEGINNING TO TRACK SOUTH TOWARD THE OHIO RIVER/...FAIRLY DECENT
CHANCES FOR SCATTERED STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE STORMS WILL EXIST
ONCE AGAIN. COVERAGE MAY EVEN HIGHER THAN TODAY...GIVEN THE
AFOREMENTIONED FRONT WHICH MAY KICK OFF A GREATER AMOUNT OF
ACTIVITY IN KENTUCKY WHICH SHOULD EVENTUALLY MAKE IT DOWN INTO EAST
TN/SOUTHWEST VA BY THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. OTHERWISE CONTINUED
HOT AND HUMID TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S WILL
CONTINUE UNDER A PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY.


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
A CLOSED LOW WILL BE CROSSING EASTERN CANADA WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
FRIDAY...WITH A BROAD TROUGH STRETCHING ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS TO 
THE GULF COAST. MODELS ARE SHOWING GOOD CONSENSUS WITH THIS GENERAL 
PATTERN...AS ARE THE ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. WITH WEAK SYNOPTIC LIFT 
ACTING ON A VERY MOIST AIR MASS WITH PW AROUND 2 INCHES...LIKELY 
POPS SEEM WARRANTED FOR THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL 
CERTAINLY BE A CONCERN BOTH DAYS...AND WITH CAPE AROUND 2000 
J/KG...ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS MAY ALSO BE POSSIBLE. 

THE RIDGE OVER THE PLAINS WILL BUILD EAST...PUSHING THE TROUGH 
FARTHER TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST. THIS WILL BRING A DRIER AIRMASS TO 
THE REGION...FURTHER REDUCING PRECIP CHANCES BY SATURDAY AND 
PROVIDING A WARMING TREND. SUNDAY AND MONDAY LOOK DRY WITH A 700-300 
MB RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING OVER THE AREA. THE GFS INDICATES THAT 
ANOTHER CLOSED LOW WILL BE LOCATED OVER EASTERN CANADA BY 
TUESDAY...WHICH MAY HELP WEAKEN THE RIDGE AND ALLOW UPSTREAM 
CONVECTION TO TRACK OUR WAY IN A NW FLOW ALOFT. WILL OPEN DAY 7 WITH 
A SLIGHT CHANCE POP.

AN UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE REMAINS THE DOMINANT SYNOPTIC
SCALE WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE REGION TODAY...WHICH WILL PROMOTE
SOME INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT. THUS...DESPITE
SOME CLOUD COVER FROM CONVECTION...SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES ARE
EXPECTED FOR THIS AFTERNOON AS HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO MIDDLE 90S
IN MOST AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN. SPEAKING OF
CONVECTION...THE UPPER-WAVE THAT BROUGHT SOME ENHANCED LIFT TO THE
REGION YESTERDAY HAS PUSHED WELL SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA.
HOWEVER...GIVEN THE PERSISTENT WARM AND VERY HUMID AIRMASS IN PLACE
AND THE PRESENCE OF A FEW RESIDUAL OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES...REASONABLE
CHANCES FOR SCATTERED STORMS WILL EXIST ONCE AGAIN LATE THIS
MORNING TROUGH THIS EVENING /WITH THE MORE FAVORED AREAS BEING
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU/. HAVING SAID
THAT...RADAR IS SHOWING SOME MODERATE SHOWERS/ISOLATED STORMS
DEVELOPING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN KENTUCKY AND MOVING INTO THE GREAT
TENNESSEE VALLEY...SO 30 TO 40 POPS SEEMS REASONABLE AREAWIDE FOR
TODAY. GIVEN THE MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE /WITH PWATS PROGGED TO BE
FAIRLY HIGH AROUND 1.5-1.8 INCHES AND A DEEP WARM CLOUD
LAYER/...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL ONCE AGAIN BE THE PRIMARY
CONCERN WITH ANY ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP. HOWEVER...MODEL
SOUNDINGS HAVE A DISTINCTIVE INVERTED-V PROFILE AND CONTINUE
INDICATE CAPE VALUES AOA 1500-2500 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES AOA -3C
TO -4C BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. THUS...THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO
LOCALLY SEVERE STORMS WILL ONCE AGAIN EXIST...WITH THE PRIMARY RISK
BEING STRONG DOWNBURST WINDS. GIVEN THE VERY POOR WIND SHEAR
HOWEVER...STORM ORGANIZATION WILL BE FAIRLY POOR AND FAVOR A
PULSE-TYPE STORM MODE.

INSTABILITY FOR THE NEXT COUPLE HOURS. OTHERWISE...WOULD EXPECT
LITTLE CHANCE OF RAIN OVERNIGHT. FOG IS LIKELY TO DEVELOP AT TRI
WHERE FLIGHT CONDITIONS SHOULD BECOME IFR AND POSSIBLY LIFR AROUND
07-12Z. MVFR CATEGORY FOG IS POSSIBLE AT TYS DURING THIS SAME
PERIOD. EXPECT WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION AGAIN ON TUESDAY WITH
PROBABILITY TOO LOW TO MENTION AT TRI AND TYS. HOWEVER...THERE MY
BE A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR A THUNDERSTORM AROUND CHA SO INCLUDED
VICINITY THUNDER HERE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
315 PM EDT MON JUL 16 2012

.SHORT TERM...
THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT WILL BE
PRECIPITATION CHANCES AS LIFT FROM AN UPPER-TROUGH MOVING THROUGH
THE REGION WILL COMBINE WITH AN ABUNDANTLY MOIST ATMOSPHERE TO
CREATE SOME REASONABLE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE SCATTERED
IN NATURE AS IT DEVELOPS ACROSS SRN KENTUCKY...NE TENNESSEE...SW
VIRGINIA...AND ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU...GRADUALLY SPREADING SOUTHEAST INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY
AND THE SPINE OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE OVERALL ENVIRONMENT
IS EXTREMELY FAVORABLE FOR HEAVY RAINFALL WHICH WILL BE THE PRIMARY
THREAT /ALONG WITH LIGHTNING/ FROM ANY ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP.
MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE SHOWING A LARGE TALL/NARROW AREA OF CAPE AOA
2000 J/KG...A DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER AND PWATS AOA 1.7-1.9 INCHES.
WIND SHEAR VALUES TODAY ARE SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN YESTERDAY...WHICH
COMBINED WITH THE INSTABILITY PARAMETERS HAS ALLOWED SOME OF THIS
ACTIVITY TO BECOME STRONG AND DEVELOP INTO SEMI-ORGANIZED MULTICELL
CLUSTERS. OVERALL...FEEL THAT THE SEVERE POTENTIAL THROUGH THIS
EVENING IS STILL FAIRLY LOW...BUT NOT ZERO GIVEN THE AFOREMENTIONED
ENVIRONMENT IN PLACE. GIVEN THE INVERTED-V NATURE OF THE
SOUNDINGS...STRONG OUTFLOW WINDS FROM THESE STORMS WOULD BE THE
OTHER THREAT THAT THE STRONGEST CELLS WOULD POSSESS.

STORMS SHOULD BEGIN TO DIMINISH SOMEWHAT AFTER SUNSET...THOUGH SOME
ISOLATED ACTIVITY COULD LINGER /PARTICULARLY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS
AND NORTHEASTERN ZONES THROUGH MIDNIGHT OR SO/. CLOUD COVER SHOULD
BEGIN TO EVENTUALLY THIN OUT LATER TONIGHT...WHICH COMBINED WITH
THE VERY MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER AND CALM WINDS WILL PROVIDE A
REASONABLE SHOT OF PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT AREAWIDE AFTER 06Z.
THUS...HAVE ADDED A MENTION OF THIS IN THE ZONES. OTHERWISE...
CONTINUED MILD OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER
70S ARE EXPECTED ONCE AGAIN FOR MOST LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM...
THE MIDLEVEL FLOW ACROSS THE EASTERN CONUS WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY 
AMPLIFIED AS A RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE PLAINS AND A CLOSED LOW CROSSES 
EASTERN CANADA AND NEW ENGLAND. SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION IS 
EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY...THEN MORE ORGANIZED DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS AND A SURFACE FRONT 
APPROACHING FROM THE NORTH. GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS AND ECMWF ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS PATTERN AND TIMING...SO CONFIDENCE IS HIGH. 
POPS RISE TO LIKELY NORTH THURSDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY...THEN LIKELY POPS TREND SOUTHWARD FRIDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES 
TO THE TN/KY BORDER WITH A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TN 
VALLEY. 

WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE TROUGH AXIS FRIDAY NIGHT...A DEEP NORTHERLY 
FLOW OF DRIER AIR SHOULD REDUCE POPS TO A SLIGHT CHANCE IN MOST 
SPOTS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. A RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING FROM THE GREAT 
PLAINS HIGH BUILDS OVER THE AREA FOR MONDAY...WHICH SHOULD FURTHER 
REDUCE PRECIP CHANCES. WILL OPEN DAY 7 WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...
A LARGE SUBTROPICAL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM REMAINS THE DOMINANT
WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE REGION...WHICH HAS PROMOTED THE MOSTLY
TO PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION
THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...AN UPPER SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS ALSO ROTATING
ALONG THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS RIDGE. THIS FEATURE WILL SERVE
AS A FOCUS FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY
LATE THIS MORNING THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. GIVEN THE ABUNDANT
MOISTURE AT THE SURFACE /WITH LOW 70S DEWPOINTS NEARLY EVERYWHERE
AND PWATS AOA 1.7-1.8 INCHES/...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE A
BIG THREAT WITH ANY ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP. MODEL SOUNDINGS
ALSO SUPPORT THIS...SHOWING A DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER AND A
TALL/NARROW AREA OF CAPE VALUES AOA 1500-2000 J/KG BY THE
AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE INSTABILITY PARAMETERS IN PLACE...STRONG TO
LOCALLY SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE /MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON
AND EARLY EVENING/. WIND SHEAR VALUES ARE FAIRLY POOR...BUT MAY
SUPPORT SOME SEMI-ORGANIZED MULTICELL CLUSTERS OF STORMS THAT
COULD PRODUCE HEAVY RAINFALL IN THIS WARM...HUMID AIRMASS OVER
LOCALIZED AREAS SHOULD TRAINING OCCUR. THE BEST CHANCES FOR ANY
ACTIVITY WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA THROUGH THE
EARLY AFTERNOON...BEFORE SLIGHTLY FAVORING THE MOUNTAINS AND THE
SOUTHERN TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON. DESPITE THE SCATTERED
NATURE OF THIS CONVECTION...FELT THAT GENERALLY 40 TO 50 POPS
SEEMED WARRANTED /PARTICULARLY GIVEN THIS VERY MOIST AIR MASS/.
OTHERWISE...PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE
UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S SHOULD BE EXPECTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE

BOUNDARIES AND ONE MAY DRIFT OVER TRI DURING THE FIRST HOUR OR SO
OF THE FORECAST SO PLACED SOME PREVAILING THUNDER IN HERE. DON'T

THE PAST COUPLE NIGHTS AND EXPECT INSTRUMENT FLIGHT MAY BE REQUIRED
AGAIN AT THESE TERMINALS LATE TONIGHT. NOTICED TYS PICKED UP SOME
MORE PRECIP TODAY IN A THUNDERSTORM WITH HEAVY RAIN SO THIS MAY
PROVIDE SOME VAPOR IN PERSISTENTLY MOIST NEAR SURFACE ENVIRONMENT.
CONVECTION MAY BE MORE WIDELY SCATTERED AT TYS AND CHA ON MONDAY SO
LEFT OUT VICINITY THUNDER HERE. WOULD EXPECT A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE
FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM AT TRI AS SHORT WAVE TROUGH DROPS

NORTHERN AREAS TONIGHT...AND WILL KEEP BEST POPS THERE. WILL MENTION 
PATCHY FOG AGAIN AS WELL FOR TONIGHT.  CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... AN UNSETTLED WEATHER
PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE DURING THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK.
ABUNDANT LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE UNDERNEATH AN UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE WILL COMBINE WITH A REMNANT FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND AN UPPER-
SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO PROVIDE SOME REASONABLE CHANCES FOR SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WITH THE RIDGE CENTERED
DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA ON TUESDAY...STORM COVERAGE MAY BE SOMEWHAT
SPARSER GIVEN SOME WARMER TEMPERATURES ALOFT /WHICH MAY ALLOW HIGHS
TO CREEP BACK TOWARD THE MID 90S ACROSS SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE
AREA/. STORM COVERAGE SHOULD BEGIN TO INCREASE IN COVERAGE BY MID
TO LATE WEEK HOWEVER...AS THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE PASSES
THROUGH THE REGION AND THE RIDGE SHIFTS OFF THE WEST. A STRONG
UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH EASTERN CANADA WILL PUSH A
COLD FRONT SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND POTENTIALLY INTO THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY INTO
FRIDAY...WHICH WOULD SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME MORE WIDESPREAD
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY AND ALSO PROMOTE SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER
CONDITIONS FOR LATE IN THE WEEK. GIVEN THE PROGGED INSTABILITY
VALUES...FEEL THAT ANY STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP WILL BE CAPABLE OF
BECOMING STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE...PARTICULARLY LATE IN THE WEEK
WHEN BULK SHEAR VALUES INCREASE. GIVEN THE HIGH PWATS...LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE GREATEST IMPACT WITH ANY

ACROSS THE REGION...WITH ABUNDANT LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE STILL PRESENT
AND THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER-TROUGH GRADUALLY MEANDERING EAST
TOWARD THE AREA...REASONABLY SOLID CHANCES FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION
WILL EXIST THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. GIVEN THE PROGGED INSTABILITY
PARAMETERS AND VERY HIGH PWAT VALUES IN EXCESS OF 1.75
INCHES...STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG
VERY HEAVY RAINFALL WITH ANY ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP. THE
SLIGHTLY MORE FAVORED AREA FOR PRECIPITATION WILL BE ACROSS THE
NORTHWEST/WESTERN ZONES WHICH WILL LIKELY BE CLOSEST TO THE
POSITION TROUGH AXIS AND THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE EASTERN
MOUNTAINS. ADDITIONALLY WITH CONTINUED HIGHER THICKNESS
VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT...HIGHS WILL REMAIN AT SEASONABLE LEVELS
IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S...THOUGH AFTERNOON CLOUD COVER/STORMS
WILL LIMIT HEATING IN SOME AREAS.

HEADING INTO THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEK...MODELS SHOW THE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE PUSHING WEST INTO THE MID/LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
VALLEY AS A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM BLASTS THROUGH EASTERN 
CANADA. THE SYSTEM WILL DRIVE A FRONT INTO THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY...AND POTENTIALLY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS/TENNESSEE 
VALLEY LATE THIS WEEK /THOUGH MODEL SOLUTIONS ARE STILL DIFFERING 
ONT THE TIMING/MAGNITUDE OF THIS/. FOR NOW...HAVE KEPT SOLID 30 TO 
40 POPS IN THE ZONES FOR THE LATE PERIOD AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR THE LATEST MODELS TRENDS WITH RESPECT TO THIS SYSTEM.

SOUTH TRANSPORTING GULF OF MEXICO MOISTURE INTO THE TENNESSEE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD SLOWLY

WILL LINGER.  HARD TO FIND MUCH FORCING OTHER THAN DIURNAL 
HEATING...SO PLAN TO CARRY CHANCE POPS TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...WITH 
HIGHEST VALUES THIS EVENING/SAT AFTERNOON. EXPECT SOME SUN 
SATURDAY...AND TEMPS SHOULD BE HIGHER THAN TODAY.  HOWEVER...WILL 
NOT GO QUITE AS HIGH AS MAV CENTRAL AND NORTH...BUT WILL BLEND IN A 
BIT OF THE LOWER MET NUMBERS IN THOSE AREAS.  MAV TEMPS LOOK GOOD 
FOR TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM...(SAT NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...AN UPPER-LEVEL
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE REGION FROM THE
EAST SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...SQUEEZING AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH
AXIS THAT HAS BEEN SITTING OVER AREA THIS WEEK BACK ALONG THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI RIVER. DESPITE THE RIDGE BUILDING OVERHEAD...GIVEN THE
ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE PRESENT ACROSS THE REGION SOME
DIURNALLY INDUCED SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS ARE EXPECTED ON
SUNDAY INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK /WITH THE MORE FAVORED AREAS BEING THE
EASTERN MOUNTAIN ZONES/. GIVEN THE INSTABILITY PARAMETERS IN PLACE
ACROSS THE AREA...SOME LOCALLY STRONG STORMS WILL BE
POSSIBLE...WITH HEAVY RAINFALL BEING THE BIGGEST THREAT AS PWATS
WILL REMAIN OVER 1.75 INCHES. GIVEN THE INCREASING THICKNESS
VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT...HIGHS WILL ALSO REBOUND TO AT OR
SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONABLE LEVELS NEXT WEEK...WITH THE MERCURY
REACHING THE UPPER 80S TO LOW 90S IN MOST LOCATIONS.

THE AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH AXIS MAY BEGIN TO MEANDER BACK TOWARD THE 
REGION DEPENDING ON WHERE THE CENTER OF THE RIDGE IS LOCATED...BUT 
IT IS GENERALLY PROGGED TO REMAIN TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE AREA. 
THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT WEATHER FEATURE OF NOTE MAY COME TOWARD THE END 
OF THE WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM PASSES THROUGH THE 
NORTHEASTERN US...POTENTIALLY PUSHING A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE AREA. 
HOWEVER...MODEL SOLUTIONS STILL DISAGREE ON HOW THIS SITUATION WILL 
EVOLVE AS SOME GUIDANCE INDICATES A RIDGE CONTINUING TO DOMINATE THE 
WEATHER ACROSS THE REGION INTO THE WEEKEND. THUS FOR NOW...HAVE KEPT 
THE FORECAST PRETTY GENERIC AND WILL WAIT FOR SOME BETTER MODEL 
CONTINUITY BEFORE ALTERING THE FORECAST TO FAVOR A PARTICULAR

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THE MUCH NEEDED RAINFALL CONTINUES TO SLOWLY WORK ITS WAY ACROSS E
TN AND SW VA THIS AFTERNOON. THE RAIN HAS BEEN SLOW TO MOVE INTO
THE TRI CITIES AREA AND PARTS OF SW VA DUE TO THE EASTERLY
DOWNSLOPE LOW LEVEL WINDS. THESE WINDS HAVE KEPT THE LOWER
ATMOSPHERE RELATIVELY DRY MUCH OF THE DAY. WHAT HAS FALLEN HAS BEEN
LIGHT. ANTICIPATE THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE TO WIN OUT OVER THE LIMITED
DRYING OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD BE WELL
LESS THAN A QUARTER OF AN INCH...BUT WE WILL TAKE WHAT WE CAN GET.
CHATTANOOGA RECORDED ALMOST 2.25 INCHES OF RAINFALL FOR THE PAST
SIX HOURS ENDING AT 2PM. 

OVERNIGHT...SHOWERS SHOULD BE SPOTTY AS THEY WILL MOVE UP FROM
NORTHEAST ALABAMA AND NORTHERN GEORGIA. LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG
COULD DEVELOP ESPECIALLY NEAR THE TRI CITIES SHORTLY AFTER
MIDNIGHT. THE CONVERGENT ZONE...WHERE ALL THIS PRECIPITATION IS
TAKING PLACE WILL SLOWLY MIGRATE WEST AS HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE
EASTERN NORTH CAROLINA COAST BUILDS INTO EAST TENNESSEE BY MID DAY
FRIDAY. BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL REMAIN OVER THE PLATEAU THROUGH
TOMORROW. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A GRADUAL WARMING AND DRYING TREND WILL BE IN STORE ACROSS THE
REGION HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH AXIS THAT HAS BEEN SITUATED ACROSS THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS WILL SHIFT FURTHER WEST /ALMOST
DIRECTLY ALONG THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER/...ALLOWING FOR A
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO NOSE INTO THE AREA FROM THE EAST. SOME FAIRLY
APPRECIABLE MOISTURE WILL STILL BE PRESENT UNDERNEATH THE RIDGE
THIS WEEKEND...WHICH WILL PERMIT SOME DECENT CHANCES FOR SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA BOTH DAYS. GIVEN SOME OF
THE PROGGED INSTABILITY PARAMETERS...SOME STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE
STORMS /ALONG WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL/ WILL CERTAINLY BE
POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY. AS THE RIDGE BECOMES CENTERED
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION EARLY NEXT WEEK...POPS WILL
DECREASE SLIGHTLY AS THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPS ALOFT INCREASE. AS A
RESULT...DAYTIME HIGHS ARE EXPECTED TO RETURN TO AROUND NORMAL FOR
MID-JULY IN THE UPPER 80S TO THE LOWER 90S ACROSS THE ENTIRE
FORECAST AREA. HEADING INTO THE LATTER HALF OF NEXT WEEK...THE
FORECAST WILL BECOME A BIT MORE COMPLICATED AS AS THE ECMWF
MAINTAINS AN UPPER-RIDGE OVER THE REGION...WHILE THE GFS SHOWS A
STRONG UPPER-TROUGH PUSHING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND DROPPING A
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND INTO THE AREA. GIVEN THESE
DRAMATIC DIFFERENCES...HAVE MAINTAINED SEASONABLE TEMPS IN THE
UPPER 80S/LOWER 90S AND LOW TO MODERATE CHANCE POPS FOR DAYS 6 AND
7 AND WILL WAIT FOR SOME BETTER MODEL CONTINUITY BEFORE ALTERING
THE FORECAST TOWARD ONE SOLUTION.

.AVIATION...ABUNDANT MOISTURE WILL BE LIFTED IN ADVANCE OF AN UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TODAY GENERATING
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AT THE TERMINALS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM LATER
TODAY AROUND CHA. FLIGHT CONDITIONS MAY RANGE FROM MVFR/OCCASIONAL
IFR AT CHA TO MVFR AT TYS. EASTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN
AT TRI MAY KEEP WIDESPREAD LOWER CEILINGS AND MVFR VSBY IN -SHRA FROM
FORMING AT TRI TODAY. THE RAIN SHOULD TAPER OFF SLOWLY FROM WEST TO
EAST THIS EVENING WITH A FEW SHOWERS POSSIBLY STILL OCCURRING IN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER DAY WITH RATHER 
HIGH PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE 
ATMOSPHERE COMPLETE WITH MOISTURE PROFILE...LOW LEVEL AND UPPER 
LEVEL FEATURES LOOKS SIMILAR TO WEDNESDAY. MORE SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
WILL BE AVAILABE ALOFT WITH CONVERGENCE ALONG AN 85H TROUGH 
EXTENDING ACROSS THE REGION IN A VERY MOIST ENVIRONMENT. ONCE AGAIN 
THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR IMPRESSIVELY BELOW NORMAL HIGH TEMPERATURES 
WITH A BROAD EASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS. STAYED CLOSE TO A 
GUIDANCE BLEND WHICH OFFERS ANOTHER VERY SMALL DIURNAL RANGE IN 
TEMPERATURES. LACK OF LOW LEVEL WARMING SHOULD KEEP CONVECTION 
LIMITED AGAIN TODAY WITH MOST PRECIPITATION FALLING IN THE FORM OF 
SHOWERS. MAINTAINED HIGH POPS THIS EVENING DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN HOW 
QUICKLY UPPER LEVEL ENERGY DEPARTS NORTHEAST INTO THE UPPER OHIO 
VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL 
GRADUALLY BUILD WESTWARD THROUGH THE WEEKEND...LEADING TO DRIER AND 
WARMER CONDITIONS ACROSS THE AREA. DEEP MOISTURE WILL STILL BE IN 
PLACE FRIDAY WITH PW NEAR 2 INCHES...BUT FORCING WILL BE WEAKER AS 
THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEPARTS. WITH THE RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE 
CAROLINAS...BEST PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE IN THE WESTERN SECTIONS ON 
FRIDAY...BUT POPS WILL BE IN THE LIKELY RANGE EVERYWHERE. 

FOR SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...A TROUGH WILL BE NEARLY STATIONARY 
OVER THE MS VALLEY AS THE RIDGE AXIS EXTENDS ACROSS THE GULF COAST 
STATES. DECREASING GULF MOISTURE AND WEAK SYNOPTIC LIFT WILL RESULT 
IN MAINLY DIURNAL CHANCE-SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL BE GRADUALLY WARMING EACH DAY 
UNDER THE BUILDING RIDGE...WITH HIGHS IN THE VALLEY MAINLY IN THE 
UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SOAKING RAINS OVER MUCH OF THE 
AREA FOR MUCH OF THE DAY.  PRECIP COVERAGE HAS BEEN WANING FOR THE 
PAST COUPLE OF HOURS...BUT BY LATE TONIGHT...NEXT SURGE SHOULD BE 
SPREADING ACROSS THE AREA FROM THE SOUTHWEST.  GROUNDS ARE SOAKED IN 
MANY AREAS...BUT HOLDING OFF ON A FLOOD WATCH BECAUSE THE AREAS WITH 
THE HEAVIEST FORECAST QPF LATE TONIGHT AND THURSDAY ARE A LITTLE 
WEST OF WHERE THE LOWER FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE IS.  WILL HAVE HEAVY 
RAINFALL POSSIBLE IN SOME OF THESE AREAS...ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND 
WEST.  SCENARIO FOR THURSDAY LOOKS LIKE BETTER LIFT WILL STAY WEST 
OF OUR CWA WITH TROWAL TYPE OF LIFT ROTATING AROUND WEAK UPPER LOW. 
WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED FOR ANY CHANGES MAKING FOR MORE OF A THREAT 
INTO OUR AREA.

FOR 24 HOUR QPF FORECAST...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...HAVE A LITTLE 
OVER AN INCH AT KCHA...A LITTLE UNDER AN INCH AT KTYS...AND ABOUT 
1/2 INCH AT KTYS.  NW CWA ALSO ABOUT 1 INCH OR SO.  AFTER SUCH A HOT 
AND DRY SPELL LEADING INTO THIS EVENT...RIVERS STILL FORECAST TO 
STAY PRETTY LOW.  

FOR TEMPS...WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE OVERNIGHT...AND A LITTLE ON THE 
COOL SIDE FOR THURSDAY MAX TEMPS.  


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A WEAK UPPER 
TROUGH WILL MOVE NORTH ACROSS THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS 
THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH ABUNDANT SUB-TROPICAL MOISTURE 
CONTINUING TO LIFT NORTH ACROSS THE FROECAST ARA. PWS WILL BE NEAR 2 
INCHES OVER THE REGION. MODELS SHOW SOME DIFLUENCE ALOFT ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY/CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. ALSO...SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT NOTED AS 
WELL FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. 

MODELS SHOW ANOTHER WIDESPREAD CONVECTIVE COMPLEX MOVING ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT WITH ADDITIONAL 
STRONG CONVECTION FOR FRIDAY...ESPECIALLY OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. WILL INCLUDE SOME RAIN MAY BE HEAVY IN THE 
FORECAST. 

FOR THIS WEEKEND...BERMUDA RIDGE BUILDS BACK WEST INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS WITH PWS DROPPING TO 1.4-1.7 INCHES...SO COVERAGE OF 
STORMS WILL LESSENS WTIH BEST POPS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. WEAK 
UPPER RIDGING WILL REMAIN INTO EARLY-MID NEXT WEEK. WILL MAINTAIN 
MAINLY DIURNAL POPS WITH CONTINUED GREATEST COVERAGE OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS.

BE AVAILABLE FOR LIFTING IN THE CONVERGENT ZONE ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
85H LOW OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH EXTENSION OF TROUGH 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. ADDITIONALLY...LIFT SHOULD BE 
ENHANCED AS WEAK VORTS SHIFT EAST NORTHEAST OVER THE REGION. ONE OF 
THESE FEATURES APPEARS TO BE MOVING TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA FROM 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE EARLY THIS MORNING. SLOW MOVING SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS MAY PRODUCE SOME LOCALIZED FLOODING AGAIN TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. WIDESPREAD CLOUD COVER AND CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION WILL 
INHIBIT INTENSE HEATING TODAY AND STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE 
MAX TEMPS. WENT A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE SUGGESTED MINS TONIGHT IN THE 
HUMID AIRMASS REMAINING OVER THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...FOR THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT...LOW PRESSURE WILL TRACK FROM WEST TN TO THE GREAT 
LAKES...WITH A PERSISTENT AND DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW OF GULF MOISTURE 
KEEPING THE AIR MASS VERY MOIST. THE BEST FORCING FOR HEAVY PRECIP 
ON THURSDAY APPEARS TO BE OVER MIDDLE TN CLOSER TO THE LOW...THOUGH 
A JET STREAK ACROSS THE OH VALLEY REGION WILL PROVIDE GOOD UPPER 
DIVERGENCE AND A WARM FRONT WILL BE LIFTING NORTH ACROSS OUR AREA. 
QPF AMOUNTS ON THE ORDER OF 1 INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE IN SOUTHERN AND 
WESTERN SECTIONS THURSDAY...AND CATEGORICAL POPS WILL BE FORECAST. 

AS THE LOW MOVES INTO IL/IN ON THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY...PRECIP WILL 
LIKELY BECOME MORE DIURNALLY-BASED AS WE LOSE OUR MID/UPPER LEVEL 
FORCING AND THE RIDGE ALONG THE CAROLINA COASTLINE RETROGRADES. 
MOISTURE WILL REMAIN PLENTIFUL HOWEVER...SO WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS ON 
FRIDAY. BY SATURDAY THE RIDGE AXIS EXTENDS ACROSS

330 AM EDT TUE JUL 10 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...A SLOW-MOVING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY WILL BE THE DOMINANT 
FEATURE FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. A DEEP MOISTURE FEED OFF THE GULF 
WILL KEEP PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES BETWEEN 1.75 AND 2 INCHES 
THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD. THE DIFFICULTY WILL BE TO PINPOINT THE 
TIMING AND AREAS OF STRONGER LIFT...AND THE MODELS HAVE SOME 
DISAGREEMENT ON THIS. FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...MESOSCALE BOUNDARIES 
WILL BE THE MAIN FOCUS FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT AS SYNOPTIC LIFT 
WILL BE LACKING. AS WE MOVE TOWARD WEDNESDAY...THE FLOW ALOFT 
BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED...WITH A 300 MB TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE MS 
VALLEY AND THE JET ENTRANCE REGION OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. 
THE GFS AND CANADIAN POINT TOWARD WEDNESDAY FOR GREATEST SYNOPTIC 
LIFT IN THE JET ENTRANCE REGION AND 700 MB DEFORMATION ZONE. THE NAM 
GIVES THE BEST LIFT ON THURSDAY WITH STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE AND A 
850 CONVERGENCE ZONE ACROSS SOUTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS. GIVEN 
THIS UNCERTAIN TIMING...WILL BLANKET LIKELY POPS FOR BOTH DAYS. WITH 
EITHER MODEL SCENARIO...DEEP MOISTURE AND PERIODS OF HEAVY RAINFALL 
WILL BE LIKELY...WITH GOOD POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING. FLOOD WATCH 
ISSUANCES MAY BE NEEDED WITH LATER FORECASTS ONCE THE TIMING BECOMES 
MORE CLEAR. WILL MENTION IN HWO FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS SEEM TO AGREE THAT THE 
FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN IN A FAVORABLE POSITION FOR CONVECTION 
ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE PERIOD AS DEEP MOISTURE TRANSPORT CONTINUES 
TO STREAM NORTH FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO. THE BROAD RIVER OF MOISTURE 
LADEN AIR FROM HIGHER LEVELS WILL BE CHANNELED BETWEEN MEAN 
TROUGHING ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND RIDGING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN ATLANTIC STATES WHILE SURFACE THROUGH LOW LEVEL FLOW 
WILL TAP THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND EASTERN GULF WATERS. TWEAKED POPS 
UP A BIT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN THIS REGIME WITH A REGION OF LIKELY 
PROBABILITIES WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE THE DEEPEST 
MOISTURE WAS PROGGED. A FAVORED REGION OF LIFT APPEARS TO BE ON THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WITH A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL COMPONENT LEADING TO 
SOME OROGRAPHIC ENHANCEMENT. ALSO ADJUSTED POPS JUST A TAD HIGHER 
FOR BOTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY...ALTHOUGH WOULD EXPECT RELATIVELY LOWER 
PROBABILITIES DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST WITH THE BERMUDA 
HIGH BULGING WESTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. AS THIS OCCURS 
THE DEEPER MOISTURE WILL BE PUSHED GRADUALLY WEST OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS WHILE SUBSIDENCE SLOWLY STRENGTHENS OVER THE REGION. 
ADJUSTED MAX TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW MOS GUIDANCE FOR THE FIRST 
COUPLE DAYS IN THE MOIST PATTERN BUT THEN STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MEX 
MAX TEMPS ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS THE RIDGE BUILDS.

1007 PM EDT MON JUL 9 2012

.DISCUSSION...
THE ONLY CHANGE MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING WAS TO INCREASE
POPS ACROSS THE WESTERN ZONES/CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TO DEFINITE
THROUGH 06Z...GIVEN THE LATEST OBS/TRENDS. THE MAIN STORY
CONTINUES TO BE THE POTENTIAL FOR SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS
AND STORMS ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THIS EVENING...AND PERSISTING
INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AS A COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO DRIFT
SOUTHWARD INTO EAST TENNESSEE. ATTM...INSTABILITY VALUES ARE STILL
FAIRLY HIGH WITH MUCAPE VALUES AOA 2000-2500 J/KG AND LIFTED
INDICES BTWN -5C TO -7C ACROSS A BULK OF EAST TENNESSEE.
THUS...SOME LOCALLY STRONGER STORMS WILL CERTAINLY CONTINUE TO
OCCUR WITH GUSTY OUTFLOW WINDS AND SOME SMALL HAIL POSSIBLE.
HOWEVER...THE BIGGEST IMPACTS FROM THESE STORMS WILL BE LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINFALL AS PWAT VALUES ARE ESTIMATED TO BE AROUND 1.75 TO
2.O INCHES. THIS COULD LEAD TO SOME MINOR FLOODING ISSUES IN
LOCATIONS WHERE STORMS TRAIN/REGENERATE /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE
HIGH TERRAIN/. WIND SHEAR VALUES ARE FAIRLY UNIMPRESSIVE...SO THE
PRIMARILY STORM MODE WILL BE PULSE TYPE AND MULTICELL CLUSTERS.

AFTER MIDNIGHT...INSTABILITY GRADUALLY DECREASES...AS DOES THE
EXPECTED STORM COVERAGE. HOWEVER...WITH MULTIPLE RESIDUAL OUTFLOW
BOUNDARIES IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION AND THE AFOREMENTIONED COLD
FRONT DROPPING INTO THE AREA...REASONABLY GOOD CHANCES FOR
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL EXIST THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT.
OTHERWISE...PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH MILD LOW
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 60S TO LOW 70S ARE EXPECTED ONCE AGAIN. NAM
SOUNDINGS SUPPORT SOME LOCALIZED AREAS OF FOG...BUT GIVEN THE CLOUD
COVER AND WARM CONDITIONS...DID NOT FEEL THAT ANY DEVELOPMENT WOULD
BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO WARRANT A MENTION IN THE ZONES.

ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH 
A HOT AND HUMID AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLD 
FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHWARD INTO EASTERN KY AND

OVER THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF IT. AS A RESULT...EXPECT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH THE BEST

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS 
COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHWARD INTO EASTERN KY AND 
SOUTHWEST VA BY SUNSET...WITH A VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AHEAD OF IT. THUS...EXPECT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE BEST 
COVERAGE OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...WHICH WILL BE CLOSER 
TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR TODAY...BUT 
WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THIS MORNING TO MENTION PARTLY SUNNY SKIES 
EVERYWHERE...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A SIGNIFICANT PATTERN CHANGE WILL BEGIN TODAY AND TONIGHT AS THE 
DOMINANT UPPER RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL FINALLY GIVE WAY TO A BROAD 
TROUGH FROM THE MS VALLEY TO THE APPALACHIANS. A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW 
WILL DEVELOP FROM 700-300 MB THROUGH THE DAY DUE TO THE OFFSHORE 
RIDGE AND A LOW IN THE TX/LA REGION. THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP THIS 
AFTERNOON WITH GREATEST COVERAGE NORTH CLOSER TO AN UPPER DIVERGENCE 
ZONE. AN ISOLATED SEVERE THREAT CANNOT BE RULED OUT WITH THE NAM 
SHOWING ML CAPE OVER 3000 J/KG IN SW VA...THOUGH SHEAR IS WEAK. 
CHANCE POPS WILL CONTINUE INTO TONIGHT WITH FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS 
AND CONTINUED MOISTURE ADVECTION. GREATER MOISTURE SHOULD KEEP TEMPS 
A BIT LOWER TODAY FROM THE PAST FEW DAYS...BUT STILL REACHING THE 
MID 90S IN MOST OF THE TN VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A FRONT TRACKS INTO THE
AREA ON MONDAY AND LINGERS OVER THE REGION INTO SATURDAY BRINGING
A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE PERIOD. WILL
CONTINUE WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR MONDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD
BECOME MORE SEASONAL FOR THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A MESO HIGH CENTERED OVER THE FORECAST AREA... 
RESULTING FROM THE CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW OF YESTERDAY'S MCS. THIS 
CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW HAS ALSO RESULTED IN A DRIER AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA...WHICH HAS LIMITED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY THIS 
AFTERNOON. MODELS INDICATE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS WILL SLOWLY BUILD EASTWARD OVER THE OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS 
ON SATURDAY...WITH TEMPS REMAINING WELL ABOVE NORMAL AND ISOLATED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING AGAIN IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. WITH THE 
CENTER OF THE UPPER HIGH CLOSER TO THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY... 
THINK THAT TEMPS SHOULD BE A LITTLE WARMER (COMPARED TO TODAY). IT 
APPEARS THAT HEAT INDICES OVER SOUTHEAST TN WILL BE AROUND 105 
DEGREES ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON...SO WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A HEAT 
ADVISORY. CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD INCREASE SOME ON SUNDAY... AS 
DEWPOINTS AND INSTABILITY SLOWLY INCREASE AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHING THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD THEN 
APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY NIGHT...INCREASING THE 
CONVECTIVE COVERAGE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT...WITH COOLER TEMPS ON SUNDAY DUE TO THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN 
CLOUD COVER AND CONVECTIVE COVERAGE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WILL BE IN AN UNSETTLED WEATHER 
PATTERN FOR THE EXTENDED. MODEL CONSISTENCY HAS BEEN POOR WITH 
TIMING OF A COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE AREA. CURRENT THINKING IS IT 
WILL MOVE IN AROUND THE MONDAY TIME FRAME...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH 
LIKELY POPS FOR MONDAY. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO STALL JUST TO THE 
SOUTH AND EAST OF THE MRX CWA AND CONTINUE TO EFFECT AREA WEATHER 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED. THIS WILL PROVIDE A CHANCE OF 
CONVECTION TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. THE COMBINATION OF SLIGHTLY 
COOLER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT AND INCREASED CLOUD COVER ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL ALLOW FOR COOLER...MORE SEASONAL

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A MESO HIGH CENTERED OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WHICH IS A RESULT OF THE CONVECTIVE 
OUTFLOW FROM YESTERDAY'S MCS. THIS CONVECTIVE OUTFLOW HAS ALSO 
RESULTED IN A DRIER AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH LOWER 
DEWPOINTS OBSERVED IN THE MID 60S. AS A RESULT...THINK THAT THE 
CONVECTIVE COVERAGE THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD BE SCATTERED. TEMPS SHOULD 
BE A LITTLE COOLER COMPARED TO YESTERDAY...DUE TO THE DELAYED 
WARMING CREATED BY THIS MORNING'S FOG COVERAGE AND INCREASED SOIL 
MOISTURE.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE THIS MORNING TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST 
TRENDS AND TO LOWER POPS A LITTLE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
OVERALL PATTERN TODAY LOOKS SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...SO WILL NOT STRAY 
TOO FAR FROM PERSISTENCE. THE DAY WILL BEGIN WITH PATCHY FOG IN 
AREAS THAT SAW RAIN YESTERDAY AND CLEARING SKIES OVERNIGHT. WV 
IMAGERY INDICATES A SHORTWAVE TROUGH ACROSS OH/PA THAT WILL BE 
MOVING SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY. THIS MAY HELP SPARK CONVECTION IN 
NORTHERN AREAS THIS AFTERNOON...MUCH LIKE YESTERDAY BUT WITHOUT AS 
MUCH SEVERE POTENTIAL. ISOLATED DAMAGING WIND GUSTS MAY BE POSSIBLE. 
A SOUTHWARD MOTION OF STORMS WILL BRING THEM ACROSS THE TN VALLEY 
THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. WILL HAVE HIGH CHANCE POPS 
IN MOST SPOTS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE LATEST MOS GUIDANCE 
HAS TRENDED COOLER WITH TEMPERATURES TODAY...AND WITH MOST AREAS 
RECEIVING SOME GROUND MOISTURE FROM YESTERDAY'S STORMS...WILL LOWER 
TEMPS A BIT FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST...THOUGH STILL ABOVE THE 00Z MOS. 
THIS WILL PUT THE SOUTHERN VALLEY BELOW HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR 
THE VAST MAJORITY OF THE DAY. HEAT INDICIES SHOULD TOP OUT BETWEEN 
100-104...SO WILL CANCEL THE HEAT ADVISORY. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES 
TRACKING THROUGH THE REGION BRINGING A CHANCE FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE WEEKEND. MOST OF THE ACTIVITY SHOULD 
DIURNAL. A FRONT TRACKS INTO THE AREA ON MONDAY AND LINGER OVER THE 
REGION INTO THURSDAY BRINGING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD. WILL CONTINUE WITH HIGHEST CHANCES FOR 
MONDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL FOR THE EARLY 
PORTIONS OF THE PERIOD...THEN BECOME SEASONAL FOR THE LATTER 
PORTIONS OF THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A HOT...HUMID...AND STAGNANT AIR MASS OVER THE 
REGION...WITH A VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS ALSO REVEAL AN AIR MASS THAT IS VERY CONDUCIVE TO 
PRODUCING STRONG WIND GUSTS...EVIDENCED BY AN INVERTED-V PROFILE IN 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER AND A DEEP MID-LEVEL DRY LAYER. THUS...IT APPEARS 
THAT THE CURRENT COMPLEX OF STORMS MOVING SOUTHWARD FROM THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY COULD PRODUCE A WIDESPREAD WIND EVENT WITH LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL AND FREQUENT CLOUD TO GROUND LIGHTNING. OTHERWISE... 
MODELS INDICATE THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS 
WILL BUILD FARTHER EASTWARD OVER THE WEEKEND...WITH TEMPS REMAINING 
WELL ABOVE NORMAL AND DIURNAL SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING EACH 
DAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE 
FORECAST THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...AND WILL REISSUE THE HEAT ADVISORY 
FOR SOUTHEAST TN FOR TOMORROW SINCE HEAT INDICES WILL AGAIN REACH 
AROUND 105 DEGREES IN THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN CONCERN DURING THE

TUESDAY AND CONTINUE TO EFFECT AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE REST OF THE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A HOT...HUMID...AND STAGNANT AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 60S TO 
LOWER 70S. A MODERATELY TO POTENTIALLY HIGHLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS 
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
MOVES SOUTHWARD OVER THE FORECAST AREA ALONG THE EASTERN PERIPHERY 
OF AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS SHORT WAVE HAS 
ALREADY TRIGGERED A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM (MCS) OVER OHIO THIS 
MORNING...AND THIS MCS SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING SOUTHWARD INTO THE

UNSTABLE. THUS...THIS EVENT APPEARS TO HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE 
A WIDESPREAD DAMAGING WIND EVENT ALONG WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL

415 AM EDT THU JUL 5 2012

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE LOCATED ACROSS THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY 
WILL BEGIN TO NUDGE BACK TOWARD THE REGION TODAY...RESULTING IN 
SLIGHTLY INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES AND TEMPERATURES ALOFT. 
THUS...DAYTIME HIGHS WILL BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER TODAY WITH 
MOST AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS REACHING THE MID TO UPPER 90S 
/WITH SOME LOCATIONS ACROSS SE TENNESSEE APPROACHING THE CENTURY 
MARK/. THIS HEAT WILL COMBINE WITH A HUMID AND MUGGY AIRMASS TO 
CREATE SOME HIGH HEAT INDEX VALUES...PARTICULARLY ACROSS SE 
TENNESSEE WHERE THE BOUNDARY LAYER IS NOT EXPECTED TO MIX OUT AS 
MUCH. THUS...A HEAT ADVISORY WAS NEEDED FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING ACROSS MUCH OF THIS AREA TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME DANGEROUS HEAT 
INDEX VALUES AROUND OR IN EXCESS OF 105 DEGREES. 

THE OTHER WEATHER CONCERN FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT WILL BE THE 
POTENTIAL FOR SOME STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN AN  
VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS /WITH CAPE VALUES PROGGED TO BE BTWN 
2000-3000 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES AOA -6C TO -8C/. ATTM...A COUPLE 
OF MCS FEATURES WERE NOTED ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND ARE GRADUALLY 
WORKING THEIR WAY SOUTHWARD INTO THE OHIO VALLEY THIS MORNING. 
SHOULD THIS COMPLEX /OR SOME OF ITS OUTFLOW/ APPROACH THE AREA 
DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING...IT WILL INCREASE THE THREAT FOR 
SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS OUR AREA GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT DESCRIBED 
ABOVE. THE SLIGHTLY MORE FAVORED AREA FOR STORMS MAY BE NE TENNESSEE 
AND SW VIRGINIA GIVEN THE TRACK OF THE POTENTIAL MCS...BUT MODELS 
ARE HINTING AT A REASONABLE SHOT OF SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING  
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND ACROSS MOST OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
THIS AFTERNOON. GIVEN THIS POTENTIAL...HAVE GONE ABOVE GUIDANCE AND 
KEPT A SOLID CHANCE POP IN FOR THE ENTIRE AREA THIS AFTERNOON 
THROUGH MID EVENING. ALSO...WITH THE HIGH PWAT VALUES AND SOME 
FAIRLY STEEP LOW-LEVEL LAPSE RATES...THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL AND DAMAGING WINDS WILL EXIST IN ANY STORMS THAT DO 
DEVELOP...SO HAVE KEPT A MENTION OF THOSE THREATS IN THE ZONES AS 
WELL. MOST OF THE ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP IS EXPECTED TO WANE BY 
THE LATE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS...SO HAVE DECREASED WORDING TO 
ISOLATED AFTER MIDNIGHT.    


.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
DIURNAL CONVECTION LOOKS TO OCCUR BOTH FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS STILL ON TRACK. HOT TEMPS REACHABLE
FRIDAY AFTERNOON BEFORE ANY CONVECTION DOES DEVELOP. FACTORING IN
DEW POINT TEMPS IN THE 60S TO LOWER 70S WILL ALLOW HEAT INDICES TO
CREEP BACK ABOVE 100 DEGREES... MAYBE AROUND 105 FOR PARTS OF SE
TN. SATURDAY MOS MAX TEMPS ARE A BIT LOWER THAN FRIDAY...AND IF NO
INCREASE IN CONVECTION DOES OCCUR...THEN MIGHT BE A COUPLE OF
DEGREES TOO LOW.

HEIGHTS FALL ON SUNDAY INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH COLD FRONT SAGGING 
SOUTHWARD. THIS LEADS TO INCREASING RAIN CHANCES (RAINFALL MUCH 
NEEDED) AND COOLER TEMPERATURES. I THINK LIKELY POPS ARE NEEDED BY 
SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY...BUT TIMING ISSUES SUPPORT STAYING WITH VERY 
HIGH CHANCE POPS AND SCATTERED WORDING FOR ANOTHER MODEL RUN OR SO. 

FRONTAL BOUNDARY STALLING INTO TUESDAY SEEMS REASONABLE AND GFSX MOS 
POPS ARE CONSISTENTLY HIGH FOR TUESDAY...THUS KEEPING CHANCE POPS 
FOR TUESDAY AND ALSO FOR WEDNESDAY FOR NOW.

OTHERWISE...I INCREASED SKY COVER SOME FOR PERIODS WHEN GREATER THAN 
30 PERCENT POPS WERE IN THE GRIDS. 05/00Z GFSX MOS MAX TEMPS ARE 
TRENDING A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN 04/12Z MOS...WHICH MAKES SENSE.
ADJUSTED MAINLY MAX TEMP GRIDS IN LINE WITH THIS TREND IN GFSX MOS.
MINS STAY IN THE 60S TO LOWER 70S EARLY ON IN THE EXTENDED...BUT 
THEN FALL SLIGHTLY BY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY NIGHT BEHIND THE 
FRONTAL PASSAGE.

325 PM EDT WED JUL 4 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A HOT...HUMID...AND STAGNANT AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH 
RADARS REVEALING SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE ENTIRE REGION. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT A MODERATELY TO POTENTIALLY HIGHLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY...WITH AN UPPER- 
LEVEL SHORT WAVE PROGGED TO MOVE SOUTHWARD OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
ALONG THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH CENTERED OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS SHORT WAVE HAS ALREADY TRIGGERED A MESOSCALE 
CONVECTIVE SYSTEM (MCS) OVER NORTHERN MN THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH 
SHOULD THEN MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION INTO 
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...AND THEN SOUTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA ON THURSDAY. THIS MCS WILL HAVE TO POTENTIAL TO PRODUCE A 
WIDESPREAD DAMAGING WIND EVENT ALONG WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND 
FREQUENT CLOUD TO GROUND LIGHTNING...ESPECIALLY IF IT ARRIVES IN THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS WHEN PEAK HEATING COULD CREATE A POTENTIALLY HIGHLY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL 
MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL 
IN THE ZONES. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST...BUT WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS ON THURSDAY 
DUE TO THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP COVERAGE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE UPPER RIDGE OVER 
THE PLAINS IS FIRMLY IN PLACE THURSDAY NIGHT. THE FORECAST AREA WILL 
BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE BUT ON THE EASTERN EDGE. DIURNAL STORMS WILL 
LIKELY BE DYING OUT LATE THURSDAY EVENING AS IS TYPICAL THIS TIME OF 
YEAR. 

CONFIDENCE RATHER LOW FOR PRECIP CHANCES ON FRIDAY WITH DIVERGENT 
MODEL SOLUTIONS. THE NAM PICKS UP ON A SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED MCS 
MOVING ACROSS EASTERN KY WHILE THE GFS PICKS UP WIDELY SCATTERED/ 
ISOLATED STORMS OVER THE E TN MOUNTAINS. LOW END CHANCE POPS ACROSS 
THE AREA BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON LOOKS REASONABLE.

THE BIGGER STORY THAN THE PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE THE HEAT ON FRIDAY 
INTO SATURDAY. AHEAD OF A WEAK COLD FRONT...SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL 
BE ON THE RISE ALONG WITH THE TEMPERATURES. THUS HEAT INDICES WILL 
APPROACH 105 DEGREES. THIS WILL BE SOMETHING TO WATCH OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS.

BY SUNDAY...SOME RELIEF TO THE HEAT MAY BE ON THE WAY. LONGER RANGE 
MODELS HAVE BEEN CONSISTENT IN PRODUCING RAINFALL FOR THE FORECAST 
AREA. THERE ARE HINTS OF SLOWING THIS FEATURE SO IF RAIN DOES NOT 
MAKE IT BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY LOOK LIKE THE 
BEST BET. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD STALL IN THE VICINITY EARLY 
NEXT WEEK HOPEFULLY SERVING AS A FOCUS FOR MORE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO BRING THE MUCH NEEDED RAINFALL THIS AREA NEEDS.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THAT HAS HELPED PROMOTE THE INCREDIBLE HEAT 
THAT HAS PLAGUED THE REGION IN RECENT DAYS WILL PUSH FURTHER TO THE
NORTH AND WEST OF THE AREA TODAY. THUS...WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER
THICKNESS VALUES AND TEMPERATURES ALOFT...HIGHS THIS INDEPENDENCE
DAY SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER IN MOST LOCATIONS /WITH THE
MERCURY GENERALLY PEAKING IN THE LOW TO MID 90S/. MODELS CONTINUE
TO HINT AT AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH DROPPING SOUTHEASTWARD
THROUGH THE AREA LATER TODAY...WHICH COULD PROVIDE SOME ENHANCED
LIFT FOR SOME AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER...
GUIDANCE HAS BACKED OFF ON THE THUNDER THREAT SOMEWHAT...WITH THE
NAM IN PARTICULAR NOW SHOWING VERY ISOLATED ACTIVITY GENERALLY
FAVORING THE MOUNTAINS. STILL...BASED ON THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT
IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION...THE AFOREMENTIONED SHORTWAVE AND AN
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE...CERTAINLY FEEL LIKE CHANCE POPS ARE WARRANTED
ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...THOUGH HAVE
DECREASED THEM A BIT OVERNIGHT. THE MORE FAVORED LOCATIONS FOR
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE ACROSS SW VIRGINIA AND NE
TENNESSEE...WHICH WILL BE CLOSEST TO THE BEST UPPER-LEVEL LIFT...AS
WELL AS HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS. WITH WEAK WIND SHEAR VALUES
EXPECTED...STORM ORGANIZATION SHOULD BE FAIRLY POOR...WITH PULSE
STORMS AND PERHAPS SOME MULTICELL CLUSTERS BEING THE PREDOMINANT
STORM TYPE.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO FLEX BACK OUR WAY THURSDAY INTO
SATURDAY...WHICH WOULD SENSIBLY LEAD TO MORE HOT TEMPS AND RATHER
LIMITED RAIN CHANCES. MOST LIKELY ANY CONVECTION WILL BE ISOLATED
AND MAINLY DIURNAL FOR THESE PERIODS... BUT GIVEN SOME UNCERTAINTY
I KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR NOW. THIS LED ME TO FAVOR
THE HOTTER MAX TEMPS WHERE ANY SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED...AND
IN FACT A FEW 100 DEGREE PLUS HIGHS MAY VERY WELL CREEP BACK INTO
THE REGION (ESPECIALLY ACROSS SRN AREAS).

THE PATTERN DOES TAKE A NOTICABLE CHANGE BY SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY 
WITH HEIGHTS FALLING AND A W-NW FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPING. MESOSCALE 
COMPLEX COULD EASILY BE HEADED OUR WAY BY LATE SUNDAY OR MONDAY... 
BRINGING INCREASED RAIN CHANCES AND COOLER TEMPS. FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
LOOKS TO BE APPROACHING MONDAY AND COULD HANG AROUND INTO TUESDAY
...WHICH IS BEING DEPICTED BY ECMWF. GFSX MOS POPS REMAIN ABOVE 
CLIMO FOR TUESDAY FROM LAST 3 MOS RUNS...SO IT IS WISE TO KEEP 
CHANCE POPS GOING FOR NOW. I NUDGED MAX TEMPS DOWN A BIT FOR SUNDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY GIVEN THE CHANGING PATTERN...WHILE GFSX MOS MINS 
WERE CONSISTENT AND CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...RADAR INDICATING SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH A SHORTWAVE. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST
CHANCES FOR THE EVENING HOURS FOR TONIGHT. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE
TRACKING THROUGH THE AREA BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABOVE NORMAL AGAIN...BUT NO RECORDS SHOULD
BE BROKEN. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE...STAYED CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS HAVE
DIVERGED IN THEIR SOLUTIONS FROM THE PAST TWO MAJOR RUNS. THE GFS
CONTINUES TO BE THE MOST PERSISTENT HOWEVER NAM HAS HANDLED
PRECIPITATION BETTER. STILL SEEMS REASONABLE TO HAVE HIGH END
CHANCE POPS ESPECIALLY OVER SW VIRGINIA AND NE TENNESSEE. WITH A
LOT OF CONVECTION STILL DEVELOPING BY EARLY EVENING...EXPECTING THE
ACTIVITY TO SLOWLY DISSIPATE BEFORE MIDNIGHT. THIS MAY INHIBIT THE
CELEBRATION ACTIVITIES PLANNED FOR AFTER DARK. CERTAINLY NOT CLEAR
CUT AND CONFIDENCE FROM YESTERDAY/S FORECAST IS SLIGHTLY LOWER.

BOTH THE GFS AND NAM AGREE ON A MCS TYPE SYSTEM MOVING SOUTH TO 
SOUTHWEST OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND INTO THURSDAY. 
BOTH MODELS ARE BULLISH IN COVERAGE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND A 
SYSTEM LIKE THIS COULD BRING BENEFICIAL RAINFALL TO THE REGION. 

THE GRIP OF THE UPPER HIGH BEGINS TO TAKE HOLD OF THE REGION ONCE 
AGAIN. THIS SHOULD PRODUCE WELL ABOVE NORMAL DAYTIME TEMPERATURE 
TRENDS AND LOWER RAINFALL CHANCES. THE FAVORED HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
EXTREME EASTERN TN LOOKS LIKE THE BETTER BET. 

LONGER RANGE MODELS STILL INDICATE A COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE 
FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. CONFIDENCE IS PRETTY HIGH 
THAT FOR RAINFALL ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS THE 
UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AND A COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTHWARD INTO 
AL/GA/SC AND NC. EXPECT THIS WEEKEND DAYTIME TEMPERATURES TO BE WELL 
ABOVE NORMAL...NEAR 100 DEGREES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...REMAINING CONVECTION IS
EXTREMELY ISOLATED THIS MORNING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. A
CLUSTER OF CONVECTION CONTINUES TO WEAKEN UPSTREAM OVER CENTRAL AND
NW KY...AS IT MOVES SE AT NEAR 20 MPH TOWARD NRN PARTS OF THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS ARE THINNING AND THERE
MIGHT BE A FEW AREAS OF FOG WHERE RAINS OCCURRED MONDAY AFTERNOON
OR EVENING.

03/00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW WEAKER NW FLOW ALOFT ACROSS NE HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...BUT TRACK OF CONVECTION TODAY WILL 
BE SE AT 15 TO 20 MPH. MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING OVER KY AND NRN PLATEAU IN THE HEAT OF THE 
DAY...THEN TRACKING SE. ISOLATED CONVECTION COULD ALSO POP UP JUST 
ABOUT ANYWHERE...BUT PROBABLY MORE LIKELY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 

PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED REASONABLE WITH A SLIGHT 
INCREASE TO CHANCE POPS EARLIER TODAY OVER OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES. 
THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS SUGGEST A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW MONDAY 
MAXES...WITH A BLEND OF SIMILAR MOS HIGHS GOOD. NO HEAT ADVISORY OR 
RECORD HIGHS FOR TODAY...(CHA - 102...TYS - 99...TRI - 95).

CONVECTION FOR TONIGHT SHOULD BE MAINLY LIMITED TO 00Z TO 06Z 
WEDNESDAY...WITH NO CHANGES MADE FOR NOW AS CHANCE POPS ARE 
SUFFICIENT. MOS MINS VERY CLOSE AND FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...THE MAIN WEATHER THEME FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE
CONTINUED ABOVE NORMAL /BUT COOLER/ TEMPERATURES AND SOME CHANCES
FOR SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY
NEXT WEEK. ON INDEPENDENCE DAY...THE CENTER OF A STRONG SUBTROPICAL
RIDGE WILL BE CENTERED ACROSS THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER
VALLEY...INDUCING A PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT ACROSS THE
REGION. MODELS ARE ALSO SHOWING A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PUSHING THROUGH
EAST TENNESSEE DURING THE AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL SERVE AS A TRIGGER
FOR SOME SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE REGION GIVEN THE
PROGGED INSTABILITY VALUES IN PLACE /WITH CAPE VALUES AOA 1500-2000
J/KG AND LIFTED INDEX VALUES AROUND -5C/. THE BEST CHANCE FOR
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL BE ACROSS SW VIRGINIA AND NE
TENNESSEE...WHICH WILL BE CLOSEST TO THE BEST UPPER-LEVEL LIFT.
WITH FAIRLY MODEST WIND SHEAR VALUES...STORM ORGANIZATION WILL BE
LIMITED SOMEWHAT...WITH MULTICELL CLUSTERS BEING THE PREDOMINANT
STORM TYPE. ANYONE WITH OUTDOOR PLANS ACROSS THE REGION THIS
INDEPENDENCE DAY SHOULD PLAN FOR THE REASONABLE PROBABILITY OF
THUNDERSTORMS GIVEN THE FACTORS MENTIONED ABOVE.
ADDITIONALLY...SOME COOLER TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED...WITH
HIGHS PEAKING IN THE LOW TO MID 90S...A WELCOME CHANGE AFTER THE
RECORD BREAKING HEAT THIS PAST WEEKEND.

THEREAFTER...THE AFOREMENTIONED RIDGE WILL SCOOT BACK TOWARD THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND LATER IN THE WEEK...RESULTING IN A SLIGHT 
WARMING TREND HEADING TOWARD THE WEEKEND /WITH HIGHS PEAKING IN THE 
MID TO UPPER 90S/. STILL...AT LEAST SOME SLIGHT CHANCES FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS /PARTICULARLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN/ WILL EXIST 
GIVEN THE MOISTURE THAT WILL BE PRESENT UNDER THE RIDGE AND THE 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS THAT WILL BE IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION. EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...MODELS ARE SHOWING THE RIDGE FLATTENING AND PUSHING 
SOUTH OF THE AREA AS AN UPPER-TROUGH SWINGS TROUGH THE GREAT 
LAKES...PUSHING A COLD FRONT IN THE VICINITY OF THE AREA. SHOULD 
THIS SOLUTION VERIFY...SOME COOLER TEMPERATURES AND CONTINUED 
RAIN/THUNDER CHANCES WILL EXIST HEADING INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SHORTWAVES TRACKING THROUGH THE
AREA BRINGING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT AND
TUESDAY. THE HIGHEST CHANCES WILL ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF
THE CWA. MAY SEE A FEW STRONG STORMS TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES SHOULD
BE COOLER ON TUESDAY...BUT STILL ABOVE NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THE UPPER HIGH THAT
SHIFTED WEST THIS PAST WEEKEND HAS PUT THE FORECAST AREA UNDER A
BRIEF NW FLOW REGIME THAT IS EXPECTED TO LAST THROUGH THE HOLIDAY.
ANY CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS TUESDAY AFTERNOON WILL LINGER INTO
TUESDAY NIGHT. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE VERY UNSTABLE BY LATE
AFTERNOON.

BOTH GFS AND ECMWF INDICATE A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH TRANSLATING IN 
THE MEAN FLOW ON THE NORTHEASTERN FRINGE OF THE HIGH BACK OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS PATTERN WOULD FAVOR ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. ONCE AGAIN...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE PRIMED AS INSTABILITY 
INCREASES. LIFTED INDICES FROM -4 TO -8 DEGREES C AND CAPE NEAR 1500 
J/KG WILL SUPPORT THUNDERSTORMS. IN PARTICULAR...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE LOOK LIKE THE BEST BET AS THESE LOCATIONS 
WILL BE CLOSER TO THE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT. WEDNESDAY IS THE 4TH OF 
JULY AND OUTDOOR ACTIVITIES MAY BE HINDERED BY THE STORMS. PEOPLE 
ARE REMINDED THAT IF THEY ARE CLOSE ENOUGH TO HEAR THUNDER THEY ARE 
CLOSE ENOUGH TO BE STRUCK BY LIGHTNING. 

AFTER WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS BACK OVER 
THE REGION NEARLY SQUASHING ANY PRECIPITATION CHANCES THROUGH THE 
END OF THE WEEK INTO THE EARLY WEEKEND. HIGHER TERRAIN OVER FAR 
EASTERN TN AND SW VA WILL BE FAVORED AREAS DURING THIS TIME FRAME.  

THE UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AGAIN ON SUNDAY AND THIS TIME IT LOOKS 
LIKE A LONG TERM PATTERN CHANGE. BELIEVE IT OR NOT...MODELS ARE 
HINTING AT A COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE REGION BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT 
WEEK. THE NORTHWEST FLOW WOULD HELP STEER STORMS THAT FORM OVER THE 
MS/OH VALLEYS INTO MIDDLE AND EAST TN. STILL A LONG WAYS OUT BUT FUN 
TO THINK ABOUT AFTER THE RECORD BREAKING OF RECENT PAST. NOT ONLY 
WOULD SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR ARRIVE BUT MUCH NEEDED PRECIPITATION WOULD 
BRING RELIEF TO THE DRIEST AREAS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ONE MORE DAY WITH RECORD 
HIGHS AND ABOVE 100 DEGREES STILL EXPECTED ACROSS SE TN...WHERE THE
HEAT ADVISORY CONTINUES. CONVECTION GOT RATHER ROBUST SUNDAY EVENING 
AND CONTINUES EARLY THIS MORNING...DUE IN PART TO NEW ACTIVITY 
POPPING ALONG OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES. 02/00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW THE 
UPPER RIDGE HAS GIVEN WAY A BIT TO NW FLOW ALOFT OVER MUCH OF OUR 
FORECAST AREA. MODELS IN FAIR AGREEMENT ON A SERIES OF UPPER LEVEL 
DISTURBANCES IN THIS NW FLOW...TO GENERATE THUNDERSTORMS AT ABOUT 
ANY TIME...WITH A PEAK IN THE AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS. EXPECTING A 
FEW STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE STORMS...WITH HAIL UP TO 1 INCH IN 
DIAMETER AND WIND GUSTS TO 60 MPH. TORRENTIAL RAIN...AS NOTED SUNDAY 
EVENING...IS ALSO POSSIBLE WITH A FEW STORMS. 

850 MB TEMPS AND LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES DEFINITELY DROP FROM THE HEAT 
WAVE DAYS...RIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS SHOULD EASE MAX TEMPS DOWN 
INTO THE 80S AND 90S...STILL SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS.
MOS MAX/MIN TEMPS LOOKED REASONABLE AND WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

MAJOR CHANGE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WAS TO 
INCREASE POPS JUST ABOUT EACH PERIOD...IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS AND 
ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE AT
THE SURFACE CONTINUES WITH THE MAIN UPPER RIDGE ALOFT CENTERED OVER
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH CENTRAL STATES. TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN
STATES EXTENDING THROUGH THE CAROLINAS WILL KEEP THE DOOR OPEN FOR
SHORTWAVE ENERGY TO MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS
WITH THE SOUTHWEST SECTION WITH THE LEAST CHANCE OF CONVECTION.
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ECMWF SHOWS RIDGING DEVELOPING TO THE NORTH IN
THE OHIO VALLEY WITH GFS SHOWING THIS TOO WITH DRYING NORTH AND
CONVECTION BEING CONCENTRATED TO THE SOUTH AS A POSSIBLE WEAK FRONT
MOVES INTO GA AND AL FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY. THE RIDGING NORTH AND
FRONT TO THE SOUTH MAY DECREASE IMPULSES MOVING AROUND THE RIDGE.
HIGHS SHOULD BE STILL ABOVE NORMAL IN THE LOWER TO MID 90S WITH
UPPER 80S IN SW VA AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS.
THAT IS STILL A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL.

MODELS DO NOT HAVE A HANDLE ON THIS IDEA AND PIN POINTING TIMING 
VERY DIFFICULT AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER EXPECT SOME STRONG CONVECTION

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING 
ACROSS SE STATES HAS BEEN SUPPRESSED SLIGHTLY OVER SW VA...WITH W-NW 
FLOW NOTED ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS AND OHIO VALLEY. GFS 
MODEL SEEMS MORE SENSIBLE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH NAM CREATING 
AN INCREDIBLE INCREASE IN CONVECTION WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN PATTERN. 
THUS...I KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS POP/WEATHER GRIDS...STAYING 
IN THE 15 TO 30 PERCENT RANGE ON POPS FOR NOW. TSRA FAVORS HIGHER 
TERRAIN TODAY...BUT ALLOWING FOR AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS 
THE BOARD TONIGHT. FORECAST AREA REMOVED FROM SLIGHT RISK THREAT...
BUT A BRIEFLY STRONG TO MINIMAL SEVERE STORM CAN'T BE RULED OUT IN 
THE INTENSE HEAT OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

TEMPS GET OFF TO A ROBUST START THIS MORNING...WITH LITTLE IF ANY 
DROP IN 850 MB TEMPS OR PARTIAL THICKNESSES. THIS FAVORS GOING A 
DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE THE HOTTER MOS HIGHS...EXCEPT OVER SW VA. RECORD 
HIGHS WILL BE SET AGAIN TODAY...WITH HEAT INDICES PROBABLY VERY NEAR 
VALUES FROM YESTERDAY (PROVIDED DEW POINT TEMPS TUMBLE A BIT FROM 
MIXING). HEAT ADVISORY LOOKS ON TRACK WITH NO ADDITION OF SW VA OR 
REMAINING MTN GROUPS NEEDED. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE
FINALLY BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN MONDAY. THICKNESSES LOWER AND
850 MB TEMPERATURES DROP. KEPT TREND OF TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY ABOVE
MAV MAXES ESPECIALLY WITH LACK OF RAINFALL AND RECORD BREAKING HEAT
WAVE IN PROGRESS. SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS STILL NEAR OR
SLIGHTLY ABOVE 100 WITH HEAT INDEX VALUES 100 TO 105 IN THOSE
AREAS. RECORD HIGHS STILL A POSSIBILITY FROM KNOXVILLE SOUTH. A
LITTLE BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS SHORT WAVE
ENERGY MOVES SOUTHEAST ACROSS MAINLY NE TN AND SW VA MONDAY AND
TUESDAY IN ABOUT ALL AREAS. NAM MODEL MORE AGRESSIVE WITH ACTIVITY
MONDAY AND GFS MONDAY NIGHT. WILL HAVE GENERALLY 30 PERCENT LATE
AFTERNOON AND EVENING DECREASING TO SLIGHT CHANCE OVERNIGHT MONDAY
NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. HIGHS TUESDAY A FEW DEGREES COOLER
THAN MONDAY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH UPPER RIDGE CENTERED OVER
THE CENTRAL STATES NW FLOW WILL BRING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE FORECAST AREA BUT HIGHS STILL ABOVE NORMAL.
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY THERE IS SOME REBUILDING OF THE RIDGE WHICH
SHOULD CAUSE A DECREASE IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. SOME STRONG
TO POSSIBLY SEVERE STORMS COULD DEVELOP EACH DAY WITH DAMAGING
WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL THE MAIN THREATS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE DEW POINTS AND LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE HAVE BEEN CREEPING UP. ISOLATED OROGRAPHIC CONVECTION 
REMAINS POSSIBLE THIS EVENING WITH A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY. BEST LAYER THICKNESS PACKING REMAINS NORTH OF AREA BUT A 
MEAGER SHIFT IN THE SOUTHEAST TRACK OF ONGOING CONVECTIVE COMPLEX 
COULD AFFECT NE AREAS TONIGHT. 

MODELS CONTINUE TO TRY TO SUPPRESS RIDGE SOUTH AND WEST. LEANED 
TOWARD A SLOWER AND WARMER SOLUTION GIVEN STURDY NATURE OF THE 
BUBBLE. NORTHEAST AREAS COULD SEE LOWER PARTIAL THICKNESS VALUES AND 
INCREASED CLOUD COVER RESULTING IN LOWER AFTERNOON HIGHS BUT 
READINGS WILL CONTINUE WELL ABOVE NORMAL. EXTENDED THE HEAT ADVISORY 
INTO SUNDAY FOR EXPECTED PLUS 100 HEAT INDICES BUT ALSO DUE TO 
DURATION OF THE EVENT. OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 70S WILL BE COMMON.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES ARE 
EXPECTED TO TRACK OVER THE RIDGE BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA FOR TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. STILL ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED FOR THE PERIOD. STAYED RELATIVELY 
CLOSE TO MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

455 AM EDT SAT JUN 30 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SOME LINGERING PATCHY CLOUDS 
BEHIND THE THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX...OTHERWISE THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THICKNESSES AND 850 MB TEMPS SUGGEST A 
REPEAT OF YESTERDAY'S SOARING HEAT. BASED ON HIGHS ON FRIDAY PLUS 
DEW POINT TEMPS LIKELY TO STAY A FEW DEGREES HIGHER...I OPTED TO 
EXPAND OUR HEAT ADVISORY TO INCLUDE THE NRN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
COUNTIES. MOS MAXES WERE IN LINE WITH CURRENT MAX TEMP GRID...BUT
I KEPT MOSTLY 90S FOR SW VA AND NRN MTN GROUP OF E TN. 

RAIN CHANCES ARE SLIM BUT KEEPING CONTINUITY WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
THIS AFTERNOON AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS. MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
ON ANOTHER MCS (THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX) POSSIBLY CLIPPING SW VA AND NE 
TN LATE TONIGHT. SEEMS REASONABLE...SO 15 TO 25 PERCENT POPS WERE 
ADDED FOR THOSE AREAS FROM 03Z TO 09Z SUNDAY. NAM MOS MINS MAY BE A 
TAD TOO WARM...SO I WENT CLOSER TO GFS MINS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER PATTERN BEGINS TO
CHANGE SUNDAY AS CENTER OF RIDGE ALOFT SINKS SLOWLY SOUTH.
THICKNESS VALUES LOWER AND STORM COMPLEXES DEVELOPING AROUND THE
EDGE OF THE RIDGE WILL MOVE SE INTO SW VA AND NE TN. INCREASED
MOISTURE WILL ALSO ALLOW FOR AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP IN THE UNSTABLE AIR MASS...MORE
CONCENTRATED AT FIRST IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HAVE HIGH
TEMPERATURES DROPPING FROM ABOVE 100 TO MOSTLY 90S MONDAY EXCEPT
AT CHA. DEW POINTS RISE INTO THE 60S SO HEAT INDEX VALUES SUNDAY
WILL STILL RISE TO ABOUT 100 NE TN TO ABOVE 105 NEAR CHA. ON MONDAY
EVEN WITH HIGHS SLIGHTLY COOLER HEAT INDEX VALUES ARE STILL 100 TO
105 IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS SO HEAT ADVISORIES WILL
LIKELY STILL BE ISSUED THROUGH MONDAY. FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
EXTENDED UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES OVER CENTRAL STATES AND TROUGH DIGS
SOUTH ALONG EAST COAST. SURFACE HIGH CONTINUES OVER THE SOUTHEAST
AND FORECAST AREA WILL BE AFFECTED MORE FROM SHORTWAVE ENERGY
MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE OHIO VALLEY. THERE WILL BE MORE SCATTERED
SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY AND COOLER AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES.
HOWEVER TEMPERATURES STILL ABOVE NORMAL. THERE IS SOME RISK FOR
STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY WITH HEATING AND STEEP
LAPSE RATES. DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT.

CREEP UP OVER THE WEEKEND AND THE LAYER ALSO BECOMES GRADUALLY MORE 
MOIST. ISOLATED OROGRAPHIC THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE BUT COVERAGE 
WILL BE LOW. HEAT ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED FOR SAME AREAS SATURDAY 
AND MAY BE EXPANDED IN COVERAGE. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA 
SHIFTS OUT OF THE AREA ALLOWING FOR INCREASING MOISTURE FOR THE 
PERIOD. A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES ARE EXPECTED TO TRACK OVER THE

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. TEMPERATURES 
RUNNING AHEAD OF THURSDAYS READINGS. FORECAST HIGHS TODAY IF MET
WILL BE ALL-TIME JUNE RECORDS. WILL THEY RECORD 80 DEGREES ON MT 
LECONTE? SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...TEMPS QUITE MILD THIS MORNING 
WHERE MIXING DOWN WARMER AIR ALOFT WAS OCCURRING...AND IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN AREAS. HEIGHTS RISE AGAIN SLIGHTLY TODAY WITH 850 MB TEMPS 
ALSO A DEGREE OR SO HOTTER...WHICH SUPPORTS RECORD HIGHS THIS 
AFTERNOON (POSSIBLY AT ALL TAF SITES). THE ABNORMALLY DRY SOIL 
ACROSS THE REGION ALSO FAVORS GOING WITH OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE MOS MAX 
TEMPS FOR TODAY.

HEAT INDEX VALUES ARE A CONCERN...AND DEPEND ON WHAT DEW POINT TEMPS 
DO LATER TODAY. MOS GUIDANCE...MAINLY GFS...SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON...SO DEW POINT TEMPS WERE TRENDED MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
NAM MOS. OPTED TO ISSUE A HEAT ADVISORY FOR CENTRAL/SRN VALLEY AND 
SRN PLATEAU COUNTIES...FROM 1PM TO 8PM EDT. THESE TIMES AND AREAL 
OUTLINE WERE VERY CONSISTENT WITH NWS NEIGHBORS GRIDS. 

SATURDAY MAXES SHOULD FALL A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW TODAY'S MAXES...BUT 
A RISE IN DEW POINT TEMPS WILL CREATE HEAT INDEX VALUES QUITE CLOSE 
TO CRITERIA AGAIN. OTHERWISE...GENERALLY CLOUD FREE WITH ANOTHER 
MILD TO MUGGY NIGHT IN STORE FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
HOT TREND CONTINUES SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS RIDGING ALOFT REMAINS
OVER SOUTHEAST STATES. UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO SINK SOUTH WITH UPPER
FLOW BECOMING MORE NORTHWEST ACROSS NE HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.
INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY AND
MONDAY. LOWERED HIGHS A DEGREE OR SO SUNDAY AND AGAIN MONDAY. DID
NOT WANT TO LOWER TEMPERATURES MUCH DUE TO DRY GROUND FROM LACK OF
RAIN. INCREASED MOISTURE SHOULD PRODUCE MORE CLOUD COVER SUNDAY AND
MONDAY ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.
THUNDERSTORMS THAT FORM MAY BECOME STRONG DUE TO STEEP LAPSE RATES
...MODERATE INSTABILITY AND SHEAR. LOWS WILL BE VERY MILD AS WELL
IN THE MID 60S TO MID 70S. HAVE KEPT RAIN CHANCES AT SLIGHT FROM
TUESDAY TO THURSDAY WITH GRADUALLY LOWERING HIGH TEMPERATURES BACK
DOWN TO THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S BY THURSDAY. MAY HAVE TO INCREASE
CHANCES LATE IN THE EXTENDED AS RIDGE SHIFTS BACK TO THE WEST AND

HIGHS AROUND OR IN EXCESS OF THE CENTURY MARK WILL BE COMMON ONCE 
AGAIN /PARTICULARLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN/ WHERE HEAT INDEX VALUES 
WILL APPROACH OR EXCEED 105 DEGREES. THUS...A HEAT ADVISORY WILL 
LIKELY BE NEEDED LATER THIS WEEK THROUGH THE ENTIRE WEEKEND. 
THEREAFTER...THE CENTER OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RIDGE WILL SHIFT A BIT 
TO THE SOUTH AS AN UPPER-TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH THE HUDSON BAY REGION 
OF CANADA. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES 
HEADING INTO INDEPENDENCE DAY WEEK AS THICKNESS VALUES DECREASE AND 
THE UPPER-FLOW VEERS TO THE NORTHWEST. HAVE MAINTAINED HIGHS 
GENERALLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S EARLY NEXT WEEK GIVEN THE DRY 
CONDITIONS AND MOS DEFAULTING TOO MUCH TO CLIMO IN THE EXTENDED. 
ALSO...WITH SOME MOISTURE PRESENT UNDERNEATH THE RIDGE SOME SLIGHT 
CHANCES FOR SOME THUNDERSTORMS WILL EXIST...PRIMARILY ACROSS THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. ATTM...FEEL THAT THE GFS HAS BEEN TOO AGGRESSIVE 
WITH QPF SIGNALS...PARTICULARLY ON SUNDAY GIVEN THE WARM 
TEMPERATURES ALOFT. HOWEVER...HAVE MAINTAINED LOW-END MENTIONABLE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
310 PM EDT TUE JUN 26 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A MUCH DRIER AND COOLER DAY 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. IN FACT DEW POINTS HAVE DROPPED INTO THE 
40S WITH A FEW PLACES EVEN 30S AS WINDS HAVE PICKED UP AND MIXED THE 
DRIER AIR DOWN TO THE SURFACE. TEMPERATURES HAVE ONLY WARMED TO THE 
MID 70S TO MID 80S AT 2 PM WITH RH VALUES IN THE 20S TO 30S. HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY IS 
KEEPING THE TENNESSEE VALLEY DRY AND THE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE SE 
STATES WILL REMAIN THERE AS DEBBY SLOWLY MOVES EAST NORTHEAST TOWARD 
THE FLORIDA COAST TONIGHT. THE SURFACE HIGH TO THE NORTH WILL SLOWLY 
SETTLE SOUTH TO THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS BY LATE WEDNESDAY. 

BIGGEST CONCERNS NEXT 24 HOURS WILL BE LOW HUMIDITIES AND COOL NIGHT 
TIME LOWS TONIGHT AND THE BEGINNING OF A WARMING TREND WEDNESDAY. 
WINDS WILL DECREASE BY EARLY EVENING AND TEMPERATURES WILL DROP 
QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET. TRI CITIES WILL APPROACH THE RECORD OF 49 SET 
IN 1979. OTHER SITES SHOULD STAY A FEW DEGREES ABOVE RECORD LOWS. 
WEDNESDAY WARMED HIGHS A FEW DEGREES SOUTH TO 5 TO 10 DEGREES NORTH 
WHICH WILL BE NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL AND ABOUT A 30 TO 35 
DEGREE RISE ABOVE THE MORNING LOWS. WITH THE SURFACE HIGH CENTER 
MOVING CLOSE TO EAST TN WINDS WILL BE LIGHT NORTHERLY WEDNESDAY.
MINIMUM RH VALUES WILL LOWER ABOUT TO TODAYS READINGS BETWEEN 20 AND 
35 PERCENT.   

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH LINGERING 
OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THIS UPPER HIGH 
WILL CREATE UNSEASONABLY HOT TEMPS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY THE 
END OF THE WEEK AND INTO THE WEEKEND...WITH MOISTURE AND CLOUDS FROM 
DEBBY REMAINING FAR ENOUGH EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA TO NOT PROVIDE 
MUCH RELIEF FROM THE HEAT. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY 
DRIFT INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY THE WEEKEND...BUT IS EXPECTED TO 
BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. MOISTURE WILL 
INCREASE BY THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...WHICH SHOULD 
CAUSE ISOLATED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP EACH DAY BEGINNING ON SATURDAY. 
HOWEVER...THIS MOISTURE WILL ALSO CREATE MUGGY CONDITIONS WITH 
DANGEROUSLY HIGH HEAT INDICES EACH AFTERNOON. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT TEMPS COULD ULTIMATELY BE HIGHER DUE TO THE 
DRY SOIL MOISTURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA.

EXTEND INTO THE REGION FOR THE SHORT TERM.  THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE 
QUITE DRY...SO SHOULD BE SUNNY TODAY AND CLEAR TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS 
LOOK REASONABLE ONCE AGAIN...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE 
TO STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE MRX CWA EARLY IN THE EXTENDED.  THIS WILL 
ALLOW HOT TEMPERATURES TO WARM FURTHER...POSSIBLY REACHING RECORD 
HIGHS FRIDAY AND INTO THE WEEKEND.  A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLOWLY 
DRIFTS TOWARD THE AREA AROUND THE SUNDAY TIME FRAME.  THE BOUNDARY 
SHOULD STALL JUST TO OUR NORTH.  THIS WILL IN INCREASE MOISTURE AND 
HUMIDITY AND PROVIDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF CONVECTION FOR THE LATTER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...ANOTHER MOSTLY SUNNY AND HOT DAY 
IN THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY TODAY. TEMPERATURES ARE ABOUT AS 
WARM AS SUNDAY CURRENTLY IN THE UPPER 80S NORTH TO MID 90S SOUTH.
GOOD CU FIELD HAS FORMED OVER NE TN AND SW VA BUT NO SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED YET. WEAK COLD FRONT LIES OVER KY AND 
WV WITH PRE FRONTAL AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS EASTERN 
VA. LATEST RUC MODEL SHOWS A FEW SHOWERS OR STORMS DEVELOPING 
BETWEEN NOW AND ABOUT 3Z AS THE FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE CWA. HAVE 
ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND THE 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS OF TN INCLUDING SW VA THROUGH EARLY EVENING. 
OTHERWISE A COOLER NIGHT AS AN EVEN DRIER AIR MASS MOVES INTO THE 
REGION OVERNIGHT AND TUESDAY. TUESDAY WILL BE MUCH COOLER WITH HIGHS
IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S SW VA AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND 80S 
ELSEWHERE. LOCATIONS NEAR CHA MAY STILL BE CLOSE TO 90. HOWEVER DEW 
POINTS FALLING INTO THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S SOUTH WILL HELP WITH 
THE BREAK IN THE HEAT. FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MAV LOWS TONIGHT AND THE 
WARMER MAV HIGHS FOR TUESDAY.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH DEVELOPING 
OVER THE MIDDLE OF THE COUNTRY WITH TROPICAL STORM DEBBY SLOWLY 
DRIFTING UP THE EASTERN SEABOARD. THIS UPPER HIGH WILL CREATE 
UNSEASONABLY HOT TEMPS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY THE END OF THE 
WEEK AND INTO THE WEEKEND...WITH MOISTURE AND CLOUDS FROM DEBBY 
REMAINING FAR ENOUGH EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA TO NOT PROVIDE MUCH 
RELIEF FROM THE HEAT. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT 
INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY THE WEEKEND...BUT SHOULD BECOME QUASI- 
STATIONARY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT MOISTURE 
WILL INCREASE ENOUGH BY THE WEEKEND TO ALLOW ISOLATED CONVECTION TO 
DEVELOP EACH DAY...BUT THIS MOISTURE WILL ALSO CREATE MUGGY 
CONDITIONS WITH HIGH HEAT INDICES. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY 
TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

WARMED INTO THE LOWER 80S ALREADY WITH WINDS STILL LIGHT. DEW POINTS
ARE IN THE 60S BUT SHOULD MIX OUT INTO THE 50S NORTH AND LOWER 60S
SOUTH LATER THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS SHOW AIR MASS BECOMES UNSTABLE
THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH MOST
UNSTABLE AREA ALONG AND JUST EAST OF THE APPALACHIAN CREST. CURRENT
FORECAST IS DRY BUT MAY SEE A FEW SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS AT LATE
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING IN THESE AREAS BEFORE DRIER AIR MASS
MOVES IN BEHIND FRONT. BELIEVE AREA AFFECTED WILL BE TOO SMALL FOR
UPDATE NOW BUT MAY NEED TO ADD A SMALL AREA WITH AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH 
THE AREA TODAY.  HOWEVER...HARD TO FIND ANY FORCING AND MOISTURE 
WILL BE QUITE LIMITED...SO NO MENTION OF ANY PRECIP AND WILL KEEP 
POPS BELOW SLIGHT CHANCE.  WILL SEE WINDS PICK UP A BIT OUT OF THE 
NORTH AND NORTHEAST TODAY.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO 
WILL STAY CLOSE.   


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAIN WEATHER STORY FOR THE 
EXTENDED WILL CONTINUE TO BE UPCOMING HEAT WAVE FOR THE LATTER HALF 
OF THE WEEK THROUGH THE NEXT WEEKEND. ALSO...CONTINUED DRY 
CONDITIONS WITH LOW AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES (AFTERNOON RELATIVE 
HUMIDITIES IN THE 20S) THROUGH THE PERIOD.

FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...SURFACE RIDGING AND DRY NORTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT WITH PWS AT OR BELOW 50 PERCENT. UPPER TROUGH OVER THE 
NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO REMAIN NEAR 
SEASONAL WITH PLEASANT READINGS AT NIGHT.

FOR THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST LIFTS 
ALLOWING A DOMINANT UPPER RIDGE TO SETTLE INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
WITH 850MB TEMPERATURES WARMING INTO THE MIDDLE 20S. IN RESULT WILL 
BE HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 90S...WITH SOME AREAS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY LIKELY REACHING TO NEAR 100 
DEGREES FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS 
CLOSELY.

MOISTURE FINALLY CREEPS BACK INTO THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND...SO WILL 
INCLUDE A SLIGHT POP FOR MAINLY THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...
SHOWER ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN MAINLY TO OUR EAST WITH A NW 
FLOW ALOFT...THE EXCEPTION BEING ISOLATED SHOWERS IN SW NC FOR THE 
NEXT FEW HOURS. SOME THIN CIRRUS FROM CONVECTION OVER IL MAY CROSS 
THE AREA OVERNIGHT...BUT WITH LITTLE IMPACT. AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS AND 
MOS GUIDANCE INDICATE LOWS TONIGHT IN THE 60S IN MOST SPOTS. 

TOMORROW WILL BE ANOTHER HOT DAY BEFORE A FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA. 
HIGHS WILL REACH WELL INTO THE 90S AGAIN...WITH CHA TOUCHING THE 
UPPER 90S. A DIFFLUENT LOW LEVEL FLOW AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND A LACK 
OF MOISTURE IN THE PRECEDING NW FLOW WILL PREVENT MUCH CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT TOMORROW. CAPPING WILL BE WEAK HOWEVER...SO WILL HAVE 
JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS THE FRONT 
APPROACHES. DRIER AIR WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 40S TO 50S WILL 
BUILD SOUTHWARD INTO THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT. THIS
SHOULD MAKE FOR A VERY COMFORTABLE NIGHT...WITH LOWS IN THE 50S
NORTH TO MID 60S SOUTH AND A LIGHT NORTH WIND.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
MAIN WEATHER STORY FOR THE EXTENDED CONTINUES TO BE A DEVELOPING
HEAT WAVE FOR THE END OF THIS WEEK AND INTO THE WEEKEND. DRIER AND
COOLER TEMPERATURES IN STORE TUESDAY BUT WARMING TEMPERATURES
WEDNESDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. PWS DROP TO 0.5 TO ONE INCH TUESDAY AND
THEN RISE SLOWLY WEDNESDAY. DEW POINTS DROP INTO THE 40S NORTH AND
50S SOUTH TUESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN GREAT
LAKES DROPS DOWN TO THE TN VALLEY AND BRINGS BRIEF FROM THE 90S
INTO THE 80S. NORTHEAST WINDS DOWN THE VALLEY WILL BRING IN THE
DRIER AIR MASS. LOWS WILL FALL TO THE 50S WITH HIGH ELEVATION SITES
POSSIBLY IN THE UPPER 40S.

AS SURFACE RIDGING FROM THE CENTRAL STATES AND LOWER MS VALLEY MOVES 
EAST AND UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NE STATES SHIFTS NE WINDS WILL SHIFT 
TO LIGHT SOUTH AND SOUTHEASTERLY AND TEMPERATURES WARM BACK TO THE 
UPPER 80S AND LOWER 90S. VERY WARM 850MB TEMPERATURES AND HEIGHTS 
THURSDAY INTO THE SATURDAY AND POSSIBLY SUNDAY WILL PRODUCE HOT 
CONDITIONS. A SLOW INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BEGIN 
THURSDAY NIGHT OR FRIDAY AS FIRST EITHER SOME MOISTURE FROM THE 
REMAINS OF DEBBY MOVES INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND THEN TN VALLEY 
OR INCREASED SOUTHERLY FLOW SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AHEAD OF A COOL 
FRONT DROPPING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. TEMPERATURES WILL REACH THE 95 
TO 100 DEGREE RANGE THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY FOR MUCH OF THE VALLEY 
AND WITH HEAT INDEX VALUES NEAR 100 OR HIGHER FRIDAY. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ALTHOUGH ISOLATED LATE FRIDAY FOR 
SOME RELIEF...THEN ISOLATED VALLEYS AND SCATTERED MOUNTAINS SATURDAY 
AND SCATTERED SUNDAY FOR MORE RELIEF. GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE GFS 
ENSEMBLE HIGH MOS VALUES FOR LAST FEW DAYS OF THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN FALLING THIS AFTERNOON WITH BOUNDARY LAYER 
MIXING AND SOME WEAK DRY ADVECTION FROM THE NORTH. AS A RESULT...WE 
SHOULD SEE TEMPS A BIT LOWER TONIGHT THAN PREVIOUS  
NIGHTS...ESPECIALLY NORTH. THIS SHOULD ALSO PREVENT WIDESPREAD FOG 
DEVELOPMENT. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES TODAY WILL 
SHIFT EAST AND BE NEAR THE MID ATLANTIC COAST TOMORROW. THE NAM 
SHOWS A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH ACROSS WEST VA TO SW VA TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON. WEAK CAPPING SEEN IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT 
ISOLATED AFTERNOON SHOWERS MAY DEVELOP IN SW VA AND NE TN. CAPPING 
LOOKS STRONG ENOUGH TO PREVENT MUCH ACTIVITY ELSEWHERE TOMORROW. 
WARM TEMPS CONTINUE FOR SUNDAY...REACHING THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
ISOLATED EARLY EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AND EXTREME NORTHEAST BEFORE SUNSET OTHERWISE A DRY AND 
WARM NIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT. WITH A NAM/GFS MODEL BLEND LOWS IN THE 60S. 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTHEAST FROM THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY TO THE TN VALLEY AND ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS. 
MODELS SHOW ONLY WEAK LIFT AND MINIMAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM 
ACTIVITY OUT AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. GFS PAINTS VERY LITTLE QPF AND NAM 
A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE. WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS MOST AREAS 
AND LOW CHANCE NE. TEMPERATURES STILL VERY WARM SOUTH AND ONLY A FEW 
DEGREES COOLER NE THAN SUNDAY. MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY A BRIEF 
BREAK IN THE HEAT AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE THAT CAME FROM SOUTHERN 
CANADA...NORTHERN PLAINS AND WESTERN GREAT LAKES MOVES OVERHEAD. 
LOWS EXPECTED TO DROP INTO MID 50S NORTH TO MID 60S SOUTH ALTHOUGH 
CHATTANOOGA UPPER 60S. MAIN STORY WILL BE BUILDING HEAT MID TO LATE 
WEEK AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES WEDNESDAY 
AND EXPANDS EASTWARD INTO THE SOUTHEAST.

A TROPICAL SYSTEM TRYING TO FORM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO TODAY IS 
FORECAST TO MOVE EITHER EAST OR WEST AND NOT INFLUENCE THE HOT 
PATTERN TAKING SHAPE OVER THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY NEXT WEEK.
HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD RISE TO THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S WEDNESDAY 
AND THEN 90S EVERYWHERE THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. FRIDAY SOME 
PLACES MAY REACH NEAR 100. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
DEVELOP IN THE TERRAIN AREAS THURSDAY AND INCREASE A LITTLE FRIDAY. 
SATURDAY RAIN CHANCES INCREASE A LITTLE MORE AS AN UPPER LOW MOVES 
OVER ONTARIO AND AN UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTH INTO THE EASTERN STATES. 
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND THE RIDGE WILL SINK 
FARTHER SOUTH.

FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...SURFACE RIDGING WITH UNSEASONABLY DRY

.DISCUSSION...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO EXIT THE 
REGION THIS EVENING AS DRIER AIR WORKS ITS WAY BEHIND THE FRONT. 
WILL UPDATED ZONES TO REMOVE EVENING WORDING. TEMPERATURES AND THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK...NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
CONVECTION HAS HAD A DIFFICULT TIME DEVELOPING ACROSS SOUTHERN AND 
CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE AREA...WITH MOST SUSTAINED ACTIVITY ACROSS 
NORTHERN AREAS. COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE SCATTERED NORTH TO 
ISOLATED SOUTH THROUGH THE EVENING. A SURFACE FRONT ACROSS CENTRAL 
KY WILL SINK SOUTHEAST TONIGHT...BUT WITH LOSS OF INSTABILITY AND A 
LACK OF MID/UPPER LEVEL LIFT...SHOWERS SHOULD END BY MIDNIGHT. THE 
FRONT REMAINS JUST NORTH OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT...AND SURFACE 
DEWPOINTS REMAIN IN THE 60S. THIS SHOULD SUPPORT FOG 
DEVELOPMENT...ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT SEE SHOWERS THIS EVENING. 
WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG IN THE NORTHERN HALF. 

A DEEP NW FLOW WILL BRING DRIER AIR ALOFT TOMORROW...WITH THE GFS  
SHOWING PW VALUES UNDER 1 INCH FOR MOST OF THE AREA. THE NAM SHOWS 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING IN WESTERN NC TOMORROW AFTERNOON ALONG A WEAK 
SURFACE CONVERGENCE ZONE...SO WILL CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN SW 
NC. TEMPS TOMORROW LOOK PRETTY SIMILAR TO THE PAST FEW DAYS...WITH 
UPPER 80S NORTH TO LOWER/MID 90S CENTRAL AND SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... 
WEAK FRONT THAT PASSED THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TODAY WILL BECOME
STATIONARY TO THE SOUTH AND EAST SATURDAY EVENING WITH A SURFACE
RIDGE BUILDING SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. A LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO IS FORECAST
TO BECOME A TROPICAL SYSTEM DURING THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS. ANOTHER
WEAK SYSTEM MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE UPPER MIDWEST SUNDAY AND
LINGERING MOISTURE ALONG AND EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL ALLOW
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP SUNDAY OVER THE
EASTERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA. MONDAY THIS FRONT MOVES
INTO THE FORECAST AREA WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION IN THE
MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY ABOVE NORMAL SUNDAY
BUT COOL MONDAY AND TUESDAY AS RAIN CHANCES INCREASE NE AND COOL
FRONT BRINGS UPPER TROUGH INTO THE REGION TUESDAY. THE TROPICAL
SYSTEM OVER THE GULF WILL PULL MOISTURE INTO THE EASTERN STATES AS
EARLY AS TUESDAY BUT MORE LIKELY LATER IN THE WEEK. SOME OF THESE
SHOWERS AND STORMS COULD MOVE INTO THE FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY
ON THIS TRACK AND ANOTHER FRONT WILL APPROACH FRIDAY. WILL FOLLOW
HIGHER POPS FRIDAY BASED ON ANOTHER FRONT RATHER THAN THE APPROACH
TO THE EAST OR SOUTHERN AREAS OF A TROPICAL SYSTEM.

ANOTHER HOT DAY TODAY WITH TEMPERATURES REMAINING ABOVE NORMAL.
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED CLOSE TO FORECAST
NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LONG-RANGE MODELS ARE IN
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE MIDDLE
OF NEXT WEEK...WITH THE MAIN FEATURES BEING A WEAK COLD FRONT
MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AND A LONG WAVE UPPER-
LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR THE WEEKEND
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. THE WEAK COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY
SHOULD HELP TO GENERATE A BETTER COVERAGE OF
CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA. WITH A LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF
THE NATION...A NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT PATTERN WILL DEVELOP OVER THE
FORECAST AREA FOR THE WEEKEND THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. THIS
NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN IS NORMALLY CONDUCIVE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF
SOME MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS (MCS) FROM THE UPPER MS RIVER
VALLEY TO EVENTUALLY AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA. FOR NOW...WILL JUST
MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...SINCE A QUASI-
STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE LINGERING ACROSS THE TN RIVER
VALLEY AND THE MODELS ARE ONLY SLIGHTLY HINTING AT THE POSSIBILITY
OF MCS ACTIVITY FROM UPSTREAM. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND
CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED
PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

312 PM EDT WED JUN 20 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)
THE UPPER HIGH HAS BEGUN TO SHIFT EASTWARD IN RESPONSE TO THE
TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS
HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE SMOKIES IN E TN AND SW
VA. EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO DIMINISH SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET. A FEW OF
THESE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL...SMALL
HAIL AND STRONG GUSTY WINDS.

THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY CURRENTLY STRETCHES FROM WISCONSIN TO KANSAS.
THIS FRONT WILL MARCH ITS WAY TO WESTERN KENTUCKY BY LATE THURSDAY
AFTERNOON. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO INFILTRATE THE
FORECAST AREA TOMORROW MAKING FOR A MORE HUMID DAY.
ADDITIONALLY...EXPECT SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS OVER MORE OF THE
REGION DUE TO THE INCREASED MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE
FRONT. LOOK FOR THE HIGHER SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM CHANCES TO
OCCUR OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA TOMORROW
AFTERNOON. 

PATCHY FOG WILL ALSO BE A POSSIBILITY OVER THE TRI-CITIES AREA
AGAIN OVERNIGHT. IT SHOULD DEVELOP AFTER MIDNIGHT AND DISSIPATE
SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A WEAK COLD FRONT
WILL SLIDE ACROSS THE AREA ON FRIDAY. MODELS TRENDING TOWARD LESS
MOISTURE...INDICATING A MORE SCATTERED BAND OF CONVECTION. HAVE
LOWERED POPS SLIGHTLY BUT WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY POPS OVER
NORTHEASTERN AREAS...THEN KEEP 20 TO 30 POPS ACROSS THE AREA FOR
THE EVENING. DIURNAL ISOLATED CONVECTION EXPECTED THIS
WEEKEND...MAINLY CONFINED TO HIGHER TERRAIN. ANOTHER EVEN WEAKER
FRONTAL BOUNDARY TRACKS THROUGH ON MONDAY FOR ANOTHER LOW CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WILL KEEP THINGS DRY FOR NOW TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN.

.DISCUSSION...
LATEST SATELLITE ANIMATION CONFIRMS THE FORECAST AREA IS ON THE
SOUTHWESTERN EDGE OF THE UPPER HIGH AS THE MODEL ANALYSIS SUGGESTS.
SUPPRESSION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HIGH MAY BE ENOUGH TO LIMIT
CONVECTION PARTICULARLY OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THIS AFTERNOON.
HOWEVER...LI/S OF -4 DEGREES C AND ANY WEAKNESS IN THE WEAK UPPER
FLOW COULD PRODUCE AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM OVER THIS AREA. SHOULD
SEE DEVELOPMENT ONCE AGAIN IN THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE TN/NC BORDER
LATER THIS AFTERNOON. THE LOW END CHANCE MENTIONED IN THE ZONES
LOOKS GOOD. FORECAST MAX TEMPERATURES IN THE 90S LOOK REASONABLE
TOO. NO MAJOR UPDATES ANTICIPATED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY.

WEEK...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE TN
RIVER VALLEY ON FRIDAY WITH A LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH
DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR THE WEEKEND AND
EARLY NEXT WEEK. ON THURSDAY...AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH WILL SLOWLY
DRIFT EASTWARD OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH ISOLATED CONVECTION
POSSIBLE AGAIN IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...MAINLY AROUND THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. A WEAK COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY SHOULD HELP TO
GENERATE A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY OVER
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE NOT INDICATING
MUCH MOISTURE WITH THIS COLD FRONT...BUT WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS FOR
FRIDAY TO MAINTAIN FORECAST CONTINUITY. NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THEN
DEVELOPS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT

AGREEMENT THAT A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP AGAIN 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...MAINLY OVER SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST 
TN... AND THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION 
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THESE AREAS FOR THIS AFTERNOON

MAXES ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY...AND WILL TREND TOWARDS A 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A TROUGH WILL TRACK THROUGH 
THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY...BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. THE HIGHEST CHANCES WILL DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING HOURS. ANOTHER TROUGH TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON THURSDAY 
BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE HIGHEST 
CHANCES WILL BE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS AGAIN. A 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA IN THE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY TIME 
FRAME BRINGING A BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. A 
BOUNDARY FOLLOWS ON SUNDAY AND INTO MONDAY PROVIDING ANOTHER CHANCE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...GETTING WARMER. ASIDE FROM
ROUTINE AFTERNOON ISOLATED CONVECTION...TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON
THE WARM SIDE. FAIRLY LIGHT WINDS WILL OFFER LITTLE RELIEF TO THE
WARMTH AND INCREASING MUGGINESS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN STORY THROUGH THIS 
TIME PERIOD WILL BE THE INCREASING CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ON FRIDAY AND THE HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS PRECEDING. 
A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. THIS UPPER HIGH WILL TRANSLATE EAST AS A 
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL INCREASE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE 
HIGH AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THIS WILL SPELL WARMER THAN 
NORMAL DAYTIME TEMPERATURES AND HIGHER HUMIDITY LEVELS PARTICULARLY 
ON THURSDAY AND INTO FRIDAY. CONSEQUENTLY...AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL ALSO BEGIN TO INCREASE WEDNESDAY AND BECOME MORE 
SCATTERED BY FRIDAY. THE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
PRECLUDE THE FRONT ON THURSDAY...WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECTED LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT. 

DO NOT EXPECT THIS FRONT TO BRING MUCH RELIEF TO THE HEAT BECAUSE 
SUMMER HAS ARRIVED. ANOTHER AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS 
THE EASTERN PLAINS AND INTO THE DAKOTAS. THE GRIPS OF THIS HIGH WILL 
BE BORDERLINE FOR US IN REGARDS TO SUPPRESSING THUNDERSTORM 
DEVELOPMENT. WE ARE WILL BE ON THE FAR EASTERN FRINGES IN NORTHWEST 
FLOW. ANOTHER WEAK BOUNDARY MAY PROVIDE ENOUGH FOCUS TO PRODUCE SOME 
ISOLATED SHOWERS SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. AC

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH AN AREA OF 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. MODELS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...SO WILL 
CONTINUE TO MENTION ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE

WILL LINGER OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE A 
LITTLE WARMER THAN NORMAL. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK 
REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A STRONG SUBTROPICAL UPPER- 
LEVEL RIDGE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE IN THE FORECAST 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK...AND POTENTIALLY INTO NEXT WEEK AS WELL. 
THE CENTER OF THIS RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA 
BY TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY...WHICH WILL PROMOTE VERY WARM 
TEMPERATURES IN THE LOW TO POTENTIALLY MID 90S AS THICKNESS VALUES/ 
850 MB TEMPERATURES INCREASE. WARMING WILL BE HINDERED SLIGHTLY ON 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY THANKS TO SOME INCREASED CLOUD COVER/ 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES ASSOCIATED WITH THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK COLD 
FRONT. THEN HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND...850 MB TEMPERATURES JUMP BY 
ABOUT 4-5 DEGREES TO AROUND 21-22C. SHOULD THIS OCCUR...EVEN WARMER 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO PERHAPS THE UPPER 90S IN SOME LOCATIONS 
COULD BE POSSIBLE BY SUNDAY. 

DESPITE THE WARM CONDITIONS...THERE WILL BE AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS EVERY THIS WEEK GIVEN THE MOISTURE THAT WILL 
BE PRESENT UNDER THE RIDGE...ALONG WITH SOME APPRECIABLE INSTABILITY 
PARAMETERS. THUS...ISOLATED/SCATTERED STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE 
STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE INITIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...BEFORE MORE WIDESPREAD ACTIVITY IS POSSIBLE THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY AS THE AFOREMENTIONED COLD FRONT PUSHES 
SOUTHWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. HAVE MAINTAINED MENTIONABLE 
POPS ALONG THE PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AFTN/ 
EVENING...BEFORE EXPANDING THEM AREAWIDE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. GIVEN 
THE INCREASED LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AND THE 
FAIRLY GOOD QPF SIGNALS SEEN WITH THE MODELS...HAVE INCREASED POPS 
TO LOW-END CHANCE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD AS WELL. SATURDAY 
GENERALLY APPEARS TO BE DRY...BEFORE ANOTHER STRONGER FRONT 
APPROACHES THE REGION SUNDAY EVENING INTO MONDAY...GIVING THE AREA 
ANOTHER SHOT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS TO BEGIN THE NEW WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SEEING AN INCREASE IN
SHRA/TSRA THIS AFTERNOON UPSTREAM OVER NRN MIDDLE TN INTO CENTRAL
AND EASTERN KY. THIS AREA IS WHERE DEEPEST LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE
WAS NOTED ALONG WITH HIGHEST INSTABILITY (CAPES OF 1000 TO 2000
J/KG). CAN'T ARGUE WITH THIS ACTIVITY MOVING ESE INTO THE FORECAST
AREA LATER THIS EVENING...AND POSSIBLY AT LEAST ISOLATED SHRA
LINGERING OVERNIGHT. FOLLOWED PREVIOUS GRIDS QUITE CLOSE FOR
TONIGHT. SEEMS BEST TO GO A FEW DEGREES ABOVE THE COOLER GFS MOS
MINS...GIVEN THE FACT THAT GFS HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY 2 TO 4 DEGREES
TOO COOL OVER PAST FEW NIGHTS.

HIGHEST PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE TONIGHT AND MONDAY...WITH A
NOTICABLE DECREASE AFTERWARDS ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHERN AREAS.
LIMITING POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY TO ERN MTNS AND HIGHER
TERRAIN OF SW VA STILL LOOKS GOOD. UNDERCUT MOS MAXES MONDAY...THEN
WENT CLOSER TO THOSE UPPER 80S AND LOWER 90S BY TUESDAY. GENERALLY
DID NOT MAKE MANY CHANGES TO FORECAST GRIDS FOR THE SHORT TERM.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE
GETS A GRADUAL NUDGE TO THE EAST EARLY IN THE PERIOD WHILE LOW
LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE CENTER MOVES OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC.
INCREASING SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL HELP TO SLOWLY MOISTEN UP THE
ATMOSPHERE OVER THE MID SOUTH ALONG WITH INCREASING INSTABILITY AS
THE UPPER RIDGE SHIFTS EAST. THEREFORE...KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS AREA WIDE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. BY FRIDAY A LONG WAVE TROUGH
WILL HAVE MIGRATED EAST ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN CANADA AND THE
NORTHEASTERN U.S. WHILE DRAGGING A COOL FRONT INTO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. MAINTAINED LOW CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION ACROSS THE
REGION ON FRIDAY DROPPING BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AS
BOUNDARY SLIPS SLOWLY SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE CAROLINAS. KEPT SLIGHT
CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ON SATURDAY DUE TO
UNCERTAINTY IN SPEED OF SURFACE FRONT. KEPT SUNDAY DRY FOR THE MOST
PART WITH AN ISOLATED POP IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. EDGED MAX/MIN
TEMPS UP JUST A BIT EARLY IN THE PERIOD WHILE UNDERCUTTING STEAMY
MAX TEMPS LATER IN THE PERIOD WHEN SURFACE BOUNDARY ENTERS THE
PICTURE LATE IN THE WEEK/EARLY NEXT WEEK.

318 PM EDT SAT JUN 16 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MOST CONVECTION TODAY HAS
STAYED OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SE KY...MOVING SOUTH AT 5 TO
10 MPH. GIVEN SLIGHT INSTABILITY AND SEVERAL HOURS OF HEATING...I
KEPT MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR THE EVENING HOURS...SLIGHTLY
HIGHER OVER THE SEQUATCHIE VALLEY COUNTIES BASED ON RADAR TRENDS. 
GFS MOS HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY A COUPLE OF DEGREES TOO COOL ON MINS
SO A MOS BLEND LOOKED BEST FOR TONIGHT.

SATELLITE PICS HINT AT A WEAK CIRCULATION IN THE UPPER MIDWEST OR
WESTERN GREAT LKES THIS AFTERNOON...AND THIS FEATURE SEEMS TO BE
WHAT MODEL DEPICT TO GENERATE SCATTERED CONVECTION OVERNIGHT. THIS
CONVECTION SHOULD REACH NRN PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA SUNDAY
MORNING OR EARLY AFTERNOON. UPPER LEVELS NOT FAVORABLE FOR ANY
CONVECTION BEYOND SUNDAY EVENING NOR ON MONDAY MORNING. DIURNAL
CONVECTION IS INDICATED FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON...MAINLY ACROSS SW VA 
NE TN AND SMOKIES. I INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY
CLOSE TO A MOS BLEND OF POPS FOR NOW. 

PERSISTENCE ON TEMPS SEEMS REASONABLE...ALTHO A SLIGHT RISE IN
HEIGHTS OCCURS MONDAY WITH MORE OF A SW LOW LEVEL FLOW...SO
POSSIBLY A FEW DEGREES WARMER FOR HIGHS MONDAY. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION ON TUESDAY WHICH SHOULD SUPPRESS CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT WITH MAINLY ISOLATED STORMS ON THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
FEATURES. HOWEVER...UPPER RIDGE SLIPS SLOWLY EAST WEDNESDAY INTO 
THURSDAY AND INSTABILITY INCHES HIGHER SO KEPT THE BROAD BRUSHED 
ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT IN PLACE FOR THIS PERIOD. BY FRIDAY AN UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH WILL HAVE MADE PROGRESS INTO THE EASTERN LAKES AND 
EVENTUALLY NORTHEAST QUARTER OF THE NATION DRIVING A SYNOPTIC COOL 
FRONT TOWARD THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY INTO 
SATURDAY. AT THIS TIME THE BEST CHANCE FOR CONVECTION WOULD BE 
FRIDAY NIGHT AS BOUNDARY SLIPS SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
HOWEVER...MAINTAINED SLIGHT CHANCE POP DURING THE DAY FRIDAY AHEAD 
OF THE FEATURE AND ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ON SATURDAY DUE TO UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW QUICKLY FRONTAL SYSTEM 
MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. WEST RELATIVELY CLOSE TO ABOVE NORMAL 
GUIDANCE TEMPS AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD AND SLIGHTLY UNDER 
DURING THE ACTIVE FRONTAL PORTION OF THE FORECAST FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES...WITH THE AIR 
MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA A LITTLE DRIER COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE MID LEVELS OF THE LOCAL ATMOSPHERE 
WILL BE A LITTLE DRIER TODAY AS WELL...SO THINK THAT ANY ISOLATED 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IN THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING WILL MAINLY BE 
AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK 
REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE MAIN FEATURE CONTROLLING 
THE WEATHER IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE A SPRAWLING UPPER-LEVEL 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE THAT WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION FROM THE 
LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THIS WEEKEND. AS THE RIDGE BECOMES MORE 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THE EARLY TO MIDDLE 
PART OF NEXT WEEK... THICKNESS VALUES AND TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON 
THE INCREASE /WITH READINGS IN THE 90S LIKELY ACROSS MOST OF AREA BY 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY/. GENERALLY DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGHOUT 
THE UPCOMING WEEK...BUT GIVEN THE MOISTURE PRESENT UNDERNEATH THE 
RIDGE AND SOME APPRECIABLE INSTABILITY PARAMETERS...ISOLATED/ 
SCATTERED STRONG TO LOCALLY SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE INITIALLY 
ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS EARLY NEXT WEEK. MODELS THEN CONTINUE TO INDICATE 
SOME BETTER CHANCES FOR SLIGHTLY MORE WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. GIVEN THIS POTENTIAL... 
HAVE GONE WITH MENTIONABLE POPS AREAWIDE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING BEGINNING WEDNESDAY. FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...AN UPPER-LOW 
SWINGING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES WILL PUSH A FRONT INTO THE AREA AND 
BEGIN TO SHOVE THE AFOREMENTIONED HIGH FURTHER TO THE SOUTH AND 
EAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...CONVECTION IS PRETTY
SPARSE THIS AFTERNOON...DUE TO LOWER DEW POINT TEMPS...MUCH LESS
ORGANIZED LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE...AND THE MAIN AXIS OF INSTABILITY
TO OUR WEST FROM MIDDLE/W TN INTO NRN MS. MODELS WERE SUGGESTING
THIS AXIS OF INSTABILITY WOULD SHIFT WEST TODAY...BUT I EXPECTED AT
LEAST A FEW POCKETS OF CONVERGENCE. OPTED TO LOWER POPS MOSTLY TO
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THE EVENING HOURS...SINCE THE AIRMASS CONTINUES
TO DE-STABILIZE AS MAX TEMPS WARM INTO THE MID 80S TO NEAR 90
DEGREES. MOS MINS HAVE BEEN QUITE CLOSE...SO JUST A MINOR TWEAK ON
GFS NUMBERS.

FOR SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...NOT MUCH FOCUS FOR CONVECTION
SATURDAY...BUT I ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE AFTERNOON FOR NRN
PLATEAU AND SMOKIES. THIS IS DUE TO OROGRAPHIC LIFT AND TO MESH
WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS. KEPT A DRY FORECAST SATURDAY NIGHT...ALTHO
MCS TYPE ACTIVITY MAY BE ONGOING TO OUR NORTH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT.
ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS NRN 2/3RDS ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON... 
WHEN MODELS SHOW A SHORTWAVE PASSING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND
OHIO VALLEY. 

MOS TEMPS LOOKED GOOD WITH GENERALLY PERSISTENT LOWS/HIGHS EXPECTED
WITH UPPER RIDGE THE DOMINANT FEATURE.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THIS PERIOD WILL BE 
CHARACTERIZED BY A STRENGTHENING RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WHICH 
WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY MID 
WEEK. IN THIS PATTERN ATMOSPHERIC CONDITIONS WILL NOT BE CONDUCIVE 
TO WIDESPREAD CONVECTION. THE BEST APPLICATION OF CONVECTIVE POPS 
THROUGH THE PERIOD WOULD BE ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES INCLUDING 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...THE HIGHER RIDGES ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND THE TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. STAYED A LITTLE 
UNDER THE MEX MOS SUGGESTED WARMING TREND DURING THE PERIOD 
CONCERNING THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST.

SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY'S. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS

TO A PERSISTENCE FORECAST SINCE THE AIR MASS REMAINS SIMILAR TO 
YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE MAIN FEATURE DOMINATING 
THE WEATHER ACROSS THE AREA FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE A 
SPRAWLING UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE. THIS RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO 
NUDGE INTO THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND EVENTUALLY THE SOUTHERN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE NOT ABLE TO 
CAP OFF CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON...AS WEAK ESE UPSLOPE FLOW HELPED 
TSRA POP ACTUALLY BY LATE MORNING. SPC MESO PAGE SHOWS A MOISTURE
CONVERGENCE AXIS FROM SURFACE TO 850 MBS EXTENDING FROM E CENTRAL 
AL/W CENTRAL GA NWD INTO SE TN AND PLATEAU. SPOTTY SHRA/TSRA 
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ALONG THIS MOIST/UNSTABLE AXIS...WITH MOVEMENT 
SLOW AND VARIABLE. BASED ON LATEST RADAR TRENDS...I ADDED SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING...FOR THESE 
AREAS. ANY AREAS GETTING RAIN TODAY COULD SEE PATCHY FOG OVERNIGHT.

OTHERWISE...EXPECT VERY SIMILAR WEATHER PATTERN FOR FRIDAY WITH 
MOSTLY AFTERNOON TSRA IN THE FAVORED HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. SLIGHT 
CHANGES OCCUR BY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...1) THE LOW LEVEL FLOW 
IS NO LONGER WEAK UPSLOPE...AND 2) 500 MB HEIGHTS INCREASE A GOOD 
BIT AS THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS NE INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION. FOR 
THESE REASONS I CHOSE TO KEEP OUR FORECAST DRY FOR BOTH FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY...AND WE WILL SEE HOW THIS PANS OUT.

FOR TEMPS...PATTERN FAVORS PERSISTENCE ON LOWS AND HIGHS...WHICH IS 
GENERALLY WHAT THE NAM AND GFS MOS ARE SUGGESTING. STAYED CLOSE TO 
PREVIOUS TEMP GRIDS AND 12Z GUIDANCE. FOR POPS...MOS POPS PROBABLY 
GOOD OVERALL...BUT TOO LOW IN HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS FOR TONIGHT AND 
FRIDAY...WHERE I KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS GOING. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL THROUGH 
SURFACE RIDGING WILL GRADUALLY EXPAND ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE LONG TERM. KEPT ALMOST THE ENTIRE PERIOD 
DRY IN THIS PATTERN WHERE AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM COULD DEVELOP 
MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES EARLY IN THE PERIOD BEFORE 
THE WARM RIDGE FORMS AND AGAIN LATE AS THE LOW LEVEL RIDGE SLIPS 
FARTHER EAST AND A SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPS. HOWEVER...PROBABILITY IS 
SO LOW WITH GUIDANCE KEEPING POPS BELOW CLIMO DECIDED NOT TO INCLUDE 
AT THIS POINT. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MEX MOS TEMPS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED.

.DISCUSSION...LAST BIT OF OVERNIGHT CONVECTION IS WELL SOUTH OF SW 
NC THIS MORNING...AND WEAKENING AS IT MOVES SOUTH. MODIFIED 12Z OHX 
SOUNDING FOR REACHING MID/UPR 80S YIELDS A POSITIVE CAPE OF AROUND 
1000 J/KG AND A LIFTED INDEX OF AROUND -5 DEGREES. NO PARAMETERS 
FAVORABLE FOR STRONG OR SEVERE STORMS...JUST BRIEF AND ISOLATED NON 
SEVERE TSRA WHICH SHOULD MOVE SOUTH AT 5 TO 10 MPH. 

SHORT RANGE MODELS STILL SUGGEST SPOTTY CONVECTION DEVELOPING THIS 
AFTERNOON...MAINLY OVER SW NC AND SMOKIES DUE TO UPSLOPE ESE FLOW. 
GFS MODEL IS LIKELY OVERDOING THE EXTENT OF COVERAGE...SO CURRENT 
FORECAST GRIDS LOOK ON TRACK.

IN THE UPPER 50S NORTHEAST TO THE MID AND UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70
SOUTHEAST. AN AXIS OF CONVERGENCE STILL LIES ACROSS WESTERN NORTH
CAROLINA INTO NORTHERN GEORGIA AND ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS ARE OCCURRING JUST SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF THE
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. THIS ACTIVITY IS PROGGED BY THE SHORT
RANGE MODELS TO SHIFT A LITTLE FARTHER WEST TODAY SO HAVE INCLUDED
POPS OVER SE TN AND SW NC MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU. THERE MAY
BE A COUPLE SHOWERS OVER THE SOUTHERN VALLEY TOO BUT EXPECT THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE PLATEAU TO HAVE MORE COVERAGE. TONIGHT THE
ACTIVITY WILL DECREASE. HIGHS TODAY SHOULD BE ABOUT THE SAME AS
WEDNESDAY OR A DEGREE WARMER WITH 90 AT CHA. LITTLE CHANGE TONIGHT
WITH A FEW CLOUDS SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA AND LOWS
ONCE AGAIN COOLER NORTH IN THE UPPER 50S WHERE AIR MASS IS DRIER
AND MID 60S SOUTH SIMILAR TO THIS MORNINGS EXPECTED LOWS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO CURRENT

SPOTTY CONVECTION ACROSS NORTHERN PLATEAU AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS 
FRIDAY. THEN SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN A BIT STRONGER EAST OF THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...PERSISTENT AXIS OF 
CONVERGENCE AND INCREASING INSTABILITY CONTINUES ACROSS GENERALLY 
WRN NC THIS AFTERNOON. THIS ACTIVITY EXTENDS SW INTO CHEROKEE AND 
CLAY COUNTIES...ALTHO STEERING FLOW IS TAKING ANY TSRA AWAY FROM OUR 
FORECAST AREA SO FAR. I DID OPT TO ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MY SW 
NC COUNTIES FOR 21Z-00Z...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SW NC AND 
EXTREME SE TN AS ESE UPSLOPE FLOW DEVELOPS LATER TONIGHT (DUE TO 
SURFACE TO 850 MB RIDGE SHIFTING EASTWARD). PATCHY FOG...MAYBE 
DENSE...SEEMS POSSIBLE AGAIN OVERNIGHT IN AT LEAST TRI AND RHP 
AREAS. I FAVORED A MOS BLEND FOR MINS OVER PURE GFS MINS...GIVEN 
LATEST DEW POINT TEMPS AND THE ESE LOW LEVEL WINDS. 

THE WEAK UPSLOPE ESE FLOW AND DAYTIME HEATING FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON
WERE WORTH ADDING SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE SMOKIES
SRN MTNS AND SW NC. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY EVENING 
JUST IN THOSE AREAS...THEN DRY FOR REMAINDER OF THURSDAY NIGHT. 
PATCHY FOG MAY BE NEEDED...BUT CAN ADD THAT AT A LATER TIME.

FOR FRIDAY...AIRMASS BECOMES UNSTABLE IN THE AFTERNOON AND I CAN'T 
RULE OUT STRAY CONVECTION DUE IN PART TO OROGRAPHIC FORCING. THUS... 
I LEFT IN THE PREVIOUS LOW POPS FOR PLATEAU AND ERN MTNS. 

MOS BLEND LOOKED GOOD FOR TEMPS FOR BOTH THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY
WITH NEAR SEASONAL TEMPS EXPECTED.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS 
THE AREA BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. A 
WEAK DISTURBANCE WILL TRACK THE REGION BRINGING A LOW CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS TO MAINLY THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. DRY CONDITIONS RETURNS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
AS RIDGE BUILDS IN. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...
THIS AFTERNOON...A COLD FRONT IS CONTINUING TO PUSH THROUGH EAST
TENNESSEE AND IS ROUGHLY LOCATED JUST EAST OF THE I-75 CORRIDOR AS
OF 3 PM EDT. THIS FRONT WILL SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. RADAR IS ALREADY SHOWING
SOME SCATTERED ACTIVITY DEVELOPING ALONG/AHEAD OF THIS BOUNDARY
ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. GIVEN THE
CURRENT INSTABILITY PARAMETERS AHEAD OF THE FRONT /WHICH INDICATE
SB CAPE AND MU CAPE VALUES AOA 1500-2000 J/KG/...AM EXPECTING
COVERAGE TO INCREASE AS THIS BOUNDARY BEGINS TO TAP INTO THE MORE
UNSTABLE AIR MASS. THE FAIRLY LOW BULK SHEAR VALUES MEAN THAT STORM
ORGANIZATION WILL BE RELATIVELY POOR...BUT SOME BRIEF STRONG
THUNDERSTORM CORES ARE CERTAINLY POSSIBLE GIVEN THE AMOUNT OF
INSTABILITY PRESENT ACROSS THIS AREA. MODELS ARE GENERALLY SHOWING
A DIMINISHING TREND WITH THIS ACTIVITY AFTER SUNSET...THOUGH SOME
STORMS MAY CERTAINLY BE ABLE TO KEEP GOING ALONG THE HIGHER
TERRAIN THROUGH THE LATE EVENING HOURS. IN WAKE OF THIS
FRONT...DRIER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR WEDNESDAY AS A SURFACE
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM BUILDS INTO THE AREA. THIS WILL PROMOTE
CLEARING CONDITIONS AND WARMER TEMPERATURES HEADING INTO THE LATTER
HALF OF THE WORK WEEK.

.LONG TERM...
BY WEDNESDAY EVENING THE COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY OOZE ACROSS NORTHERN 
GEORGIA AND NORTHERN SOUTH CAROLINA. ANY SHOWER ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED 
WITH THIS FEATURE SHOULD REMAIN SOUTH OF THE TN AND NC BORDERS 
OVERNIGHT WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR OR SLIGHTLY BELOW 
CLIMATE NORMALS.

THE UPPER FLOW WILL BE RELATIVELY WEAK OVER E TN AND SOUTHWEST VA 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT 
SHOULD REMAIN PRECIPITATION FREE AS HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATES THE 
FORECAST AREA. AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH BISECTING MIDDLE TENNESSEE 
IS EXPECTED TO TRANSLATE INTO E TN AND SW VA ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 
THE POSSIBILITIES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON IN THE VICINITY OF THIS BOUNDARY. ADDITIONALLY THE AIR 
WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE WITH LI/S BETWEEN -2 AND -4 
DEGREES C. WARM...MOIST AIR WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
PRODUCING THE DIURNAL SUMMERTIME CONVECTION SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND 
POSSIBLY SUNDAY AFTERNOON TOO. THE SURFACE TROUGH WILL REMAIN 
SITUATED SOMEWHERE ACROSS THE REGION POSSIBLY AIDING IN CONVECTION 
INITIATION THROUGH MONDAY DESPITE THE UPPER RIDGE SITTING OVER

UPPER-TROUGH AND A REMNANT OVERNIGHT/MORNING MCS ACROSS THE LOWER-
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LINGER ACROSS THE AREA. DESPITE THE LIMITED

COVER PLAYS IN HINDERING ANY DEVELOPMENT...BUT ATTM CERTAINLY
THINK THAT SOME ACTIVITY IS PROBABLE IN THIS AREA THIS AFTERNOON.
GIVEN THE UNIMPRESSIVE SHEAR VALUES...STORM ORGANIZATION WILL BE
RELATIVELY POOR...THUS DIMINISHING THE SEVERE POTENTIAL ACROSS OUR

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED COLD 
FRONT OVER THE MID TO UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A PRE-FRONTAL 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY TRIGGERING A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM (MCS) OVER 
MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL AL. IT APPEARS THAT THE STRONGEST WINDS BEHIND 
THIS MCS WERE MOVING INTO CENTRAL AL AND CENTRAL MS...WITH WEAKENING 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OBSERVED OVER MIDDLE TN. THIS WEAKENING TREND 
SHOULD CONTINUE THIS EVENING AS THIS ACTIVITY MOVES INTO EAST TN... 
SINCE A MORE STABLE AIR MASS WAS LOCATED OVER EAST TN. WITH ONLY A 
WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TOMORROW/... 
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH CONTINUES TO PUSH NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT THAT IS
APPROACHING THE LOWER- MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. A BROAD AREA OF SHOWERS
THAT PUSHED ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN TENNESSEE LATE THIS MORNING HAS
SINCE DISSIPATED AS IT PUSHED FURTHER TO THE NORTH. HOWEVER...AS
LIFT HAS INCREASED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS UPPER-TROUGH SOME
ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS MIDDLE
TENNESSEE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND GRADUALLY HAS BEEN
EXPANDING EASTWARD WITH TIME. SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY HAS BECOME
STRONGER OVER TIME /PRIMARILY ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE WHERE
INSTABILITY VALUES ARE HIGHER/. WHILE THERE IS SOME ELEVATED
INSTABILITY ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE...VALUES ARE LOWER AND THUS FEEL
ANY THUNDER THREAT WILL REMAIN FAIRLY ISOLATED LATE THIS AFTERNOON
AND THIS EVENING. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THIS ACTIVITY DEVELOPING
AND MOVING ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH MOST OF THE EARLY TO MID
EVENING...BEFORE DISSIPATING. SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY IS PROGGED
TO LINGER ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT...SO HAVE
MAINTAINED THE HIGHER POPS THERE THIS EVENING.

WITH ALL THIS DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE ACROSS THE AREA...THE FOCUS 
WILL TURN TO A COLD FRONT AND THE ASSOCIATED THUNDERSTORMS CHANCES 
IT WILL BRING TO THE AREA LATE TONIGHT INTO TOMORROW. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO INDICATE SOME FAIRLY APPRECIABLE QPF SIGNALS DEVELOPING 
ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU DURING THE 
MORNING...AND SPREADING EASTWARD AND FAVORING THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN 
ZONES BY THE AFTERNOON. WITH SOME HIGHER INSTABILITY VALUES IN 
PLACE...A BETTER CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS WILL EXIST TOMORROW AND 
HAVE ADJUSTED THE WX GRIDS TO REFLECT THIS. HOWEVER...ANY THREAT FOR 
SEVERE WEATHER STILL APPEARS TO BE PRETTY MARGINAL ATTM. GIVEN THIS 
POTENTIAL FOR PRECIPITATION...HAVE MAINTAINED SOME FAIRLY HIGH POPS 
THROUGH TOMORROW EVENING. GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT...DEEP 
WARM CLOUD LAYER AND SOME PROGGED INSTABILITY...THE THREAT FOR SOME 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING WILL CERTAINLY EXIST AS WELL... 
PARTICULARLY IF TRAINING BEGINS TO OCCUR. IN ADDITION...GIVEN THE 
EXPECTED CLOUD COVER/PRECIP CHANCES...HAVE LOWER HIGH TEMPERATURES 
BY A FEW DEGREES AS WELL.   

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
A COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. A N-NW
FLOW IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS INDICATES DYNAMIC SUPPORT FOR LIFT
ALONG THIS FRONT IS LACKING. SOME WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE MAY
BRING SOME SHOWERS TO THE AREA AFTER 00 WED...BUT WILL JUST CARRY
CHANCE POPS FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE NIGHT.

A LARGE RIDGE FROM 850-500 MB WILL EXTEND FROM EASTERN CANADA TO THE 
LOWER MS REGION...REMAINING NEARLY STATIONARY FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY. WITH A LACK OF UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT...DIURNAL CONVECTION IN 
AREAS OF HIGH TERRAIN WILL BE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THERE 
IS A SLIGHT UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THAT ROTATES AROUND A CLOSED LOW OVER 
THE EASTERN ATLANTIC THAT MODELS SHOW CROSSING THE AREA ON FRIDAY 
AND SATURDAY...WHICH MAY EXPAND THE CHANCES OF PRECIP INTO THE TN 
VALLEY. BUT WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LACKING...NO MORE THAN SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS SEEM WARRANTED AT THIS TIME. A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD PUSH OF 
THE RIDGE SHOULD REMOVE EVEN DIURNAL TERRAIN POPS FROM SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE CLOSE TO NORMAL THROUGH THE 
PERIOD...WITH VERY LITTLE DAY-TO-DAY VARIATION IN THE PERSISTENT 
BLOCKING PATTERN.

.DISCUSSION...
LATE THIS MORNING...AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT
NORTHWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY...BRINGING WITH IT ABUNDANT
GULF MOISTURE AND THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL
THIS AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT. AN INITIAL AREA OF HEAVIER SHOWERS
HAS PUSHED NORTHWARD INTO MUCH OF SOUTHEASTERN TENNESSEE THIS
MORNING AND HAS GENERALLY PRODUCED RAINFALL TOTALS OF 1/4 TO 1/2
OF AN INCH OVER THE PAST 4-5 HOURS IN THIS AREA. THIS INITIAL
CLUSTER WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ITS WAY NORTHWARD ALONG THE I-75
CORRIDOR THIS AFTERNOON. AS THE AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH CONTINUES TO
SWING NORTHWARD INTO THE AREA...SHOWER COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO
BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD AS LIFT INCREASES. THE MOST FAVORED
LOCATIONS FOR THIS ACTIVITY APPEAR TO BE ACROSS THE EASTERN ZONES/
MOUNTAINS...BUT GIVEN THE ENVIRONMENT IN PLACE...THE POTENTIAL FOR
MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY SHOWERS WILL EXIST ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA
THIS AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT...DEEP WARM CLOUD
LAYER AND SOME PROGGED INSTABILITY...THE THREAT FOR SOME LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING WILL CERTAINLY EXIST...PARTICULARLY
IF TRAINING BEGINS TO OCCUR. HOWEVER...IN GENERAL THIS IS NOT
EXPECTED TO BE A WIDESPREAD ISSUE GIVEN THE CURRENT FORWARD
MOTION OF THIS ACTIVITY AND A LACK OF ANY SIGNIFICANT BOUNDARIES IN

TROUGH ACROSS THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. MODELS SHOW THIS WAVE
LIFTING NORTH ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR
TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. ABUNDANT TROPICAL-LIKE MOISTURE WITH
PWS AROUND 2 INCHES WILL ACCOMPANY THIS TROUGH INTO THE AREA THE
NEXT 24-36 HOURS. A GOOD DEAL OF CONVECTION WITH TORRENTIALS ARE
MOVING NORTH ACROSS ALABAMA/GEORGIA. THIS ACTIVITY WILL MOVE INTO
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING/NIGHT. 

AS THE UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES THE AREA MONDAY...WIDESPREAD SHOWERS
AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS WILL ONCE AGAIN RE-DEVELOP. GIVEN PWS
NEAR 2 INCHES...SKINNY CAPE...AND OVER 10KFT DEPTH OF THE LCL-
FREEZING LEVEL...CONDITIONS ARE SET FOR HEAVY RAINS ONCE AGAIN. IF
TRAINING OF CELLS TO SETUP...FLASH FLOODING WILL BE A CONCERN FOR
THIS EVENING (SOUTHERN HALF) AND MONDAY (AREA-WIDE). HAVE INCLUDED
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE FORECAST AND HARARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.

FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE IS FAIRLY HIGH...SO DID NOT FEEL WIDESPREAD
FLOODING WOULD BE AN ISSUE.

TRENDED CLOSELY WITH GFS MOS TEMEPRATURES.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE THREAT FOR
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL PERSIST MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS AN
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH LIFTS THROUGH THE AREA AND WILL COINCIDES WITH A
PASSING COLD FRONT. THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO FEATURES WILL
FOCUS SOME OF THE DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE ACROSS THE
REGION...TRIGGERING SOME ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS.
MODELS ARE STILL INDICATING MOST FAVORED AREA FOR DEVELOPMENT WILL
BE ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN ZONES ALONG THE SPINE OF THE
APPALACHIANS BEGINNING LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS THE FRONT
PUSHES EAST AND COMBINES WITH SOME LOCALIZED OROGRAPHIC EFFECTS TO
CREATE THIS INCREASED POTENTIAL. HOWEVER...MODELS ARE SHOWING
FAIRLY WIDESPREAD COVERAGE OF APPRECIABLE QPF SIGNALS ACROSS THE
ENTIRE AREA THROUGH TUESDAY BEFORE BEGINNING TO TAPER THINGS OFF
FROM WEST TO EAST BEGINNING TUESDAY NIGHT. AS SUCH...HAVE INCREASED
POPS TO DEFINITE ACROSS MUCH OF THE EASTERN 1/2 TO 2/3 OF THE CWA
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...WITH HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION PROGGED
TO OCCUR LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING. GIVEN THE HIGH

UPPER-FLOW...THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING
WILL PERSIST THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY AND THUS HAVE CONTINUED TO
HIGHLIGHT THIS THREAT IN THE HWO. THEREAFTER...HAVE SHOWN A SHARP
DECREASE TO CHANCE POPS TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY.

A WEAK HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA THURSDAY INTO

.DISCUSSION...FIRST SURGE OF SUB-TROPICAL MOISTURE IS MOVING NORTH
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. ISENTROPIC LIFT IS PROVIDING THE
FORCING TO PRODUCE AN AREA OF RAIN ACROSS MOST OF TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THIS AREA WILL LIKELY WEAKEN AS IT MOVES
TOWARD SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. MODELS SHOW THIS FIRST PUSH OF RAIN
DIMINISHING IN COVERAGE AS THE ISENTROPIC LIFT WEAKENS. 

ABUNDANT MOISTURE ALONG WITH LOCAL TERRAIN FEATURES WILL HELP
PRODUCE SCATTERED SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON...MAINLY ALONG AND SOUTH
OF INTERSTATE 40.

MADE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO TEMPERATURES. RAISED HIGHS ACROSS
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...BUT LOWERED SOME OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTH

MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A DEEP SOUTHERLY 
WIND FLOW OVER THE SOUTHEAST...WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO BRING AN

SKIES OVER THE REGION...WITH RADARS REVEALING SOME LIGHT SHOWERS 
OVER CENTRAL AL AND CENTRAL GA. MODELS AGREE THAT SCATTERED SHOWERS 
WILL BEGIN TO MOVE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC AFTER

MOVING IN TOWARDS SUNRISE.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK IN TERMS OF PRECIP

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...RIDGING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS WILL GIVE WAY TO AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN
GULF. THIS UPPER LOW WILL DRIFT NORTH INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.
GULF MOISTURE WILL PULL NORTHWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH PWS INCREASING TO 2 INCHES+. PERIODS OF
SHOWERS AND EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN HALF
OF THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY MORNING AS A SHORT-WAVE EJECTS NORTH
TOWARD THE REGION. 

MODELS SHOW THIS WAVE WEAKENING BY EARLY AFTERNOON WITH AREA OF
RAIN DIMINISHING...BUT ABUNDANT TROPICAL-LIKE MOISTURE AND TERRAIN
FORCING WITH PRODUCE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. BEST CHANCE WILL BE
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA WITH THE MOISTURE RETURN WILL
THE DEEPEST.

LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS ARE EXPECTED WITH THE STRONGER STORMS.
LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING WILL BECOME MORE OF A CONCERN DURING THE
NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS AND THE TROPICAL MOISTURE BECOMES MORE
WIDESPREAD OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS THROUGH THE SHORT-TERM.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...EVERYTHING STILL 
LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK FOR A PROLONGED RAIN EVENT ACROSS THE REGION
AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT ACROSS THE AREA
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. WITH A STRONG FLUX OF GULF MOISTURE
BEING IN PLACE ACROSS THE AREA...CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION
CHANCES WILL PERSIST THROUGH THROUGH AT LEAST THE MIDDLE OF NEXT
WEEK AS A COUPLE OF DISTURBANCES IMPACT THE REGION. INITIALLY
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO
DEVELOP ACROSS THE REGION IN RESPONSE TO THE ENHANCED LIFT FROM THE
AFOREMENTIONED PASSING UPPER-TROUGH. HOWEVER IN ADDITION...ANOTHER
STORM SYSTEM PASSING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES WILL DROP A COLD FRONT
SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND INTO EASTERN TENNESSEE MONDAY
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. THIS FRONT WILL SERVE AS AN EVEN GREATER FOCUS
FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS. THE 06Z RUN /AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE 12Z
RUN/ OF THE NAM-12 HIGHLIGHTED THIS THREAT...SHOWING FAIRLY HEAVY
QPF SIGNALS DEVELOPING ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/GREAT TENNESSEE
VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT AND GRADUALLY WORKING THEIR WAY EASTWARD
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. IN FACT...SHOULD THE FRONT BE SLOW TO
CLEAR THE AREA SOME ENHANCED OROGRAPHIC LIFT COULD CERTAINLY LEAD
TO PERSISTENT SHOWER ACTIVITY FAVORING THE EASTERN/MOUNTAIN ZONES
THROUGH WEDNESDAY AND POSSIBLY THURSDAY EVENING.

IN GENERAL...HAVE NOT ALTERED POPS CATEGORICALLY THROUGH 
TUESDAY...BUT HAVE INCREASED THEM TO LIKELY ACROSS THE EASTERN ZONES 
TUESDAY NIGHT BEFORE SHOWING A TAPERING TREND FROM WEST TO EAST 
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT...A DEEP 
WARM CLOUD LAYER...AND THE POTENTIAL FOR NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS MOVING PARALLEL TO THE MEAN UPPER-FLOW...THE POTENTIAL 
FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING STILL APPEARS TO BE A 
CONCERN EARLY THIS UPCOMING NEXT WEEK. THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO 
HIGHLIGHT THIS THREAT IN THE HWO. GIVEN THE EXPECTED CLOUD 
COVER/PRECIPITATION CHANCES...HAVE GONE BELOW MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGH

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A DEPARTING RIDGE
OF HIGH PRESSURE SATURDAY NIGHT WILL ALLOW AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM TO SHIFT FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE

ON HOW QUICKLY ITS DEPARTURE WILL BE. GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE
CONTENT...A DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER...AND THE POTENTIAL FOR NUMEROUS

.DISCUSSION...FEW SHOWERS POPPED UP LATE WEST OF GSP AND SOUTH OF 
CLAY COUNTY NC...DRIFTING SOUTH AWAY FROM OUR FORECAST AREA.

OTHERWISE...A STREAK OF CIRRUS CLOUDS ACROSS MIDDLE AND SE TN 
ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER JET AXIS...WHILE FEW TO SCATTERED CUMULUS 
CLOUDS HAD DISSIPATED. SURFACE HIGH CENTERED TO OUR NORTH IS KEEPING 
A LIGHT NE WIND ACROSS THE VALLEY AND MUCH OF THE PLATEAU AS WELL
...AND THIS MAY REALLY HINDER FOG DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT. THINK I 
WILL DOWNPLAY FOG POTENTIAL...WHILE REMAINDER OF FORECAST IS RIGHT 
ON TRACK (INCLUDING TEMPS).

316 PM EDT THU JUN 7 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...DRY NORTHWEST FLOW WITH PWS
BETWEEN .50 AND .75 INCH AND SURFACE RIDGING WILL PRODUCE DRY
CONDITTIONS FOR THE SHORT-TERM. AREAS OF FOG NEAR AREA LAKES AND
STREAMS WITH THE MAIN STORY ALONG WITH THE DRY CONDITIONS. CALM
WINDS AND CLEAR SKY WILL ALLOW AREAS OF STREAM FOG TO DEVELOP NEAR
AREA LAKES AND STREAMS. FOR TEMPERATURES...FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE WILL PROMOTE WARM AND DRY CONDITIONS ON SATURDAY...WITH
DAYTIME HIGH TEMPERATURES APPROACHING THE MID TO UPPER 80S. THE
CENTER OF THIS RIDGE WILL THEN SLIDE OFF TO THE EAST SATURDAY
NIGHT...ALLOWING FOR AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TO PUSH
EASTWARD INTO THE AREA FROM THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS
PROVIDE A GOOD SUPPLY OF GULF MOISTURE ACROSS THE REGION AND LEAD
TO INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND RAINFALL CHANCES BEGINNING SUNDAY
MORNING INTO THE NEW WORK WEEK. MODELS HAVE BEEN IN FAIRLY GOOD
AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...THOUGH THE 12Z NAM HAS
STARTED TO PUSH CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION INTO SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE SLIGHTLY QUICKER ON SUNDAY MORNING. THUS...HAVE INCREASED
POPS A LITTLE TO SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHERN/SOUTHWEST
ZONES SUNDAY MORNING...AND INCREASED THEM TO CHANCE ACROSS MOST OF
THE AREA BY SUNDAY AS THIS SYSTEM BEGINS TO NUDGE INTO THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY. THEREAFTER...AT LEAST SOLID CHANCE POPS SEEM
PLAUSIBLE ATTM FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD AS THIS SYSTEM MAY
BE SLOW TO EXIT THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. SHOULD SOME OF THE
SLOWER MODEL PROJECTIONS COME TRUE...SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT
PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE REGION.
HOWEVER...GIVEN SOME OF THE CONTINUED MODEL UNCERTAINTY...HAVE
OPTED TO KEEP POPS AT CHANCE LEVELS FOR NOW. AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM
SYSTEM ROTATING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES BY MID-WEEK WILL FINALLY
PUSH THIS SYSTEM EAST OF THE AREA...THOUGH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD
FRONTAL PASSAGE MAY SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR ADDITIONAL THUNDER CHANCES
THROUGH WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY OF NEXT WEEK. ALSO...GIVEN THE EXPECTED
CLOUD COVER/PRECIPITATION CHANCES...HAVE GONE BELOW MOS GUIDANCE
SUNDAY THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS WILL CONTINUE 
TO VERY GRADUALLY INCREASE DURING THE SHORT TERM AS THE NORTHEASTERN 
TROUGH SLIPS EAST. THERE SHOULD BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE TODAY 
BUT WITH A CONTINUATION OF THE EASTERLY FLOW AROUND 700 MB AND 
BELOW...HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL BE JUST A TAD BELOW NORMAL IN 
THE UPPER 70S AND LOWER 80S. QUIET WEATHER EXPECTED TONIGHT WITH 
BELOW NORMAL MINS AS DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES DROP A COUPLE MORE 
DEGREES IN A LIGHT NORTHEASTERLY FLOW REGIME.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A RIDGE OVER THE AREA WILL 
KEEP THE AREA DRY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH AN UPWARD TREND IN 
TEMPERATURES EACH DAY. BY SUNDAY THE RIDGE WILL BE OFF THE ATLANTIC 
COAST...AND A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE MS DELTA 
REGION. THIS WILL GIVE A GOOD SUPPLY OF GULF MOISTURE TO THE 
AREA...WITH RAIN CHANCES INCREASING FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ON 
SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT. MODELS HAS MAINTAINED REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THIS SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM...SO CONFIDENCE IN A WET FORECAST 
FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY IS RISING.  THE LOW MOVES VERY SLOWLY EAST 
UNTIL IT GETS PICKED UP BY A MID-LATITUDE SHORTWAVE TROUGH ON 
WEDNESDAY. WITH A PROLONGED FEED OF GULF MOISTURE...WE COULD SEE 
SOME SIGNIFICANT PRECIP AMOUNTS SPREAD OVER SEVERAL DAYS. THERE ARE 
SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES IN THE MODELS REGARDING THE EXIT OF THE 
SYSTEM...BUT WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING THROUGH THE END OF THE 
FORECAST. KEPT TEMPERATURES A BIT BELOW GUIDANCE DUE TO THE EXPECTED 
BROKEN/OVERCAST CLOUD COVER IN THE VERY MOIST ENVIRONMENT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN ACROSS 
THE APPALACHIANS WITH SURFACE RIDGING. DUE TO COLD POOL ALOFT AND 
AVAILABLE MOISTURE...WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT POPS FOR THE 
NORTHEAST SECTIONS FOR THIS EVENING. MAIN CONCERN IS EXTENT OF FOG 
DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN AND EASTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE AREA. MODELS SHOW A GOOD DEAL OF SURFACE MOISTURE 
WITH DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS BECOMING NEAR ZERO OVERNIGHT. DUE TO 
LIGHT/CALM WINDS...CLEAR/PARTLY CLOUDY SKY...AND NEAR SATURATED AIR 
MASS...HAVE INCLUDED AREAS/PATCHY FOG. SOME OF THE FOG MAY BECOME 
LOCALLY DENSE. FOR THURSDAY...SURFACE RIDGING AND DRIER AIR WILL 
PRODUCE A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY AFTER FOG DISSIPATES. FOLLOWED GFS MOS 
CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THE LONG-WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION 
WILL MOVE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL 
RIDGE DEVELOPING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. BOTH 
THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT GULF MOISTURE 
WILL SPREAD NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY...AS A 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AREA BECOMES SITUATED OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC. ECMWF MODEL IS MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE GFS MODEL WITH THE 
MOISTURE RETURN FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...MAINLY DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF 
A WEAK CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW IN THE ECMWF SOLUTION. FOR NOW...WILL 
GRADUALLY INCREASE POPS FROM SUNDAY ONWARD...WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT 
EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON WEDNESDAY. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE 00Z GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
WHICH ARE IN CLOSE AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOST OF THE REGION WILL REMAIN DRY 
TODAY WITH SCATTERED ALTO CU. HOWEVER...EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH 
REMAINS IN PLACE AND A COUPLE OF SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES WILL 
ROTATE THROUGH THIS CIRCULATION AND ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. STAYED WITH SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR A 
SHOWER AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IN THIS AREA AND ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER AS THE FIRST WAVE BUILDS THROUGH EARLY IN THE 1ST 
PERIOD. THE SECOND WAVE WILL BUILD IN AROUND MID DAY INTO THE 
AFTERNOON AND MODELS INDICATE SOME INSTABILITY ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE ENHANCING LIFT. STAYED CLOSE TO A 
GUIDANCE BLEND CONCERNING MAX/MIN TEMPS TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A LARGE RIDGE WILL BE 
BUILDING OVER THE AREA AT THE BEGINNING OF THE PERIOD...GIVING DRY 
CONDITIONS AND A WARMING TREND THROUGH THE FIRST PART OF THE LONG 
TERM PERIOD. TEMPS WILL GO FROM THE MID 70S-LOWER 80S THURSDAY TO 
LOWER-UPPER 80S BY SATURDAY. THE SURFACE-850 MB RIDGE WILL BE 
POSITIONED TO OUR EAST BY SATURDAY NIGHT...PROVIDING AN INCREASINGLY 
SOUTHERLY FLOW OF GULF MOISTURE. THE MOISTURE FEED CONTINUES TO 
INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH ON SUNDAY AS LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE 
MS DELTA. THE GFS...CANADIAN...AND ECMWF ARE IN PRETTY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THIS FEATURE. ALL SHOW DEEP MOISTURE ENCROACHING ON 
THE AREA BEGINNING SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE LOW 
KEEPING PRECIP OVER THE AREA THROUGH TUESDAY. WILL RAISE POPS UP 
FROM PREVIOUS FORECASTS...BUT WILL STAY IN THE CHANCE RANGE.

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY 
CONSISTENT IN BUILDING THE UPPER RIDGE EASTWARD THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
THIS SHOULD KEEP THE FORECAST AREA MAINLY DRY WITH WARMING 
TEMPS...ALTHO I DON'T EXPECT MORE THAN STRAY 90 DEGREES OR HIGHER 
MAXES OVER THE WEEKEND...MOSTLY 80S. THE SURFACE RIDGE AXIS DOES 
SHIFT FAR ENOUGH EAST BY MONDAY TO ALLOW A GRADUAL/SLIGHT INCREASE

MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. A DEEPER MOISTURE INCREASE IS NOTED BY 
TUESDAY WHERE I INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW...WAITING TO 
SEE PERSISTENCE FROM LONG RANGE MODELS BEFORE GOING UP TO CHANCE 
POPS. HIGHER POPS MIGHT BE JUSTIFIED IF A WEAK UPPER LOW WERE TO

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...
SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA WILL BE PUSHING SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE 
MORNING AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH ROTATES AROUND THE CLOSED UPPER LOW 
OVER NEW ENGLAND. ADVECTION OF DRIER AIR FROM THE NORTH SHOULD END 
PRECIP BY NOON. HOWEVER ADDITIONAL ISOLATED SHOWERS COULD DEVELOP 
ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS THIS AFTERNOON AS MIDLEVEL TEMPS DROP BENEATH 
THE TROUGH...CREATING STEEPENING LAPSE RATES. THE CWA WILL BE SPLIT 
IN HALF BY THE 300 MB JET STREAM AND 500 MB CHANNELED VORTICITY FROM 
THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING..WITH THIS PATTERN CHANGING 
VERY LITTLE AS THE CLOSED LOW REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES BEING IN NORTHERN AREAS...WITH 
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS EACH PERIOD. POPS WILL DIMINISH LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE CLOSED LOW BEGINS TO SLOWLY TRACK EASTWARD 
AND A RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD OVER THE TN VALLEY REGION FROM THE WEST.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
EASTERN STATES UPPER TROUGH GRADUALLY SHIFTS EAST OUT TO SEA
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY ALLOWING FOR THE RETURN OF A RIDGE. THE RIDGE
AXIS BUILDS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY. THIS
PATTERN APPEARS TO PERSIST THROUGH MONDAY ALTHOUGH MODELS TRY TO
SHOW A WEAKNESS BUILDING EAST THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TOWARD
THE MID SOUTH. WITH RIDGING PRESSING A LITTLE FARTHER EAST LATE IN
THE FORECAST PERIOD THERE SHOULD BE A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MEAN
RELATIVE HUMIDITY ALONG WITH GRADUALLY INCREASING INSTABILITY.
HOWEVER...STAYED THE COURSE KEEPING THE FORECAST DRY THROUGH MONDAY
AS RIDGING SHOULD BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF
THE NEW WEEK. STAYED CLOSE TO MEX MOS GUIDANCE WHICH FEATURES A
WARMING TREND WHICH ENDS UP WITH MAX TEMPS APPROXIMATELY FIVE
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL BY SUNDAY.

TOO LONG WITH A POSSIBILITY OF SOME MVFR DETERIORATING INTO IFR
FOG. THERE COULD EVEN BE AN LIFR CEILING HERE AROUND DAYBREAK. DON'T
EXPECT TOO MUCH IN THE WAY OF THUNDER AT TYS OVERNIGHT IN GRADUALLY
STABILIZING AIR MASS BEHIND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. VICINITY THUNDER
MAY COVER THIS TERMINAL WHERE PRECIP MAY BE COMPLETED BY ABOUT 12Z
WITH VFR THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE FORECAST. BEST SHOT AT
SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS WITH THUNDER WOULD BE AT CHA WHERE
THE ACTION SHOULD HANG AROUND A LITTLE LONGER VICINITY OF THE
FRONTAL BOUNDARY AS CONVECTIVE COMPLEX SLIPS SOUTHEAST. KEPT PRECIP
GOING HERE THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS WITH VFR DURING THE LAST HALF

LATE THIS EVENING...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS ASSOCIATED
WITH A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE CONTINUE TO PUSH PRIMARILY
ACROSS NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA.
ADDITIONALLY /AS SHOWN BY THE MODELS EARLIER/...SOME HEAVIER AND
MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION HAS BEGUN TO FIRE ACROSS CENTRAL AND
WESTERN KENTUCKY WITH THE PAST HOUR OR SO AND IS GRADUALLY MAKING
IT'S WAY SOUTHEASTWARD TOWARD EASTERN/NORTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF
MIDDLE TENNESSEE. MODELS HAVE BEEN SHOWING SOME SOLID CONVECTIVE
SIGNALS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ACTIVITY PUSHING INTO THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION LATE THIS EVENING THROUGH THE
EARLY MORNING HOURS...WITH THE MORE FAVORED AREAS BEING LOCATIONS
ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE INTERSTATE 40 CORRIDOR. THOUGH THE
DIMINISHED INSTABILITY VALUES WILL BE A LIMITING FACTOR FOR
THUNDERSTORMS...THE POTENTIAL FOR AT LEAST A COMBINATION OF SHOWERS
AND STORMS WILL EXIST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA
OVERNIGHT. ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINA RAIN
CHANCES APPEAR TO BE SLIGHTLY LOWER...AND GIVEN THE LACK OF
INSTABILITY...LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS SEEM MUCH MORE LIKELY
THERE. STILL...WITH PWAT VALUES AROUND 1.2-1.4 INCHES...SOME LOCALLY
HEAVIER RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE UNDERNEATH THE STRONGER CELLS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A WARM FRONT APPEARS TO BE LOCATED BETWEEN CHA AND TYS THIS 
MORNING...AND CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONT HAS SPARKED A LINE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC. THE MAIN CONCERN 
WITH THE STORMS OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS WILL BE TRAINING AND 
FLOODING. THIS ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO DIMINISH BY LATE 
MORNING...AFTER WHICH TIME WE SHOULD SEE A BRIEF LULL IN PRECIP 
ACROSS THE AREA. WHILE UPPER LEVEL FORCING WILL BE WEAK THIS 
AFTERNOON...THE PRESENCE OF THE WARM FRONT ACROSS CENTRAL PORTIONS 
OF THE AREA AND MODERATE INSTABILITY SHOULD PRODUCE SCATTERED 
AFTERNOON/EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CENTRAL AND SOUTH. AN 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND JET ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE CLOSED LOW OVER 
NEW ENGLAND WILL DROP SOUTH INTO THE AREA TONIGHT...SO EXPECT THAT 
CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN PORTIONS 
OF THE AREA WHERE THE STATIONARY SURFACE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO 
LINGER. UNIDIRECTIONAL SHEAR PARALLEL TO THE FRONT WILL AGAIN MAKE 
TRAINING STORMS AND FLOODING A CONCERN TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHORTWAVES ARE EXPECTED TO
MOVE THROUGH THE REGION ON TUESDAY...WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY
BRINGING A CHANCE FOR MAINLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
OVER THE AREA WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF

THIS EVENING...STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED WITH AN
MCV FEATURE OVER ARKANSAS CONTINUE TO FIRE ACROSS WESTERN AND
MIDDLE TENNESSEE. WITH PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...THESE
STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT TOWARD THE REGION /MAINLY PARALLEL TO
A WARM FRONT DRAPED FROM THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL INTO SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE LATE THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...WITH THE LOSS
OF DAYTIME HEATING...INSTABILITY VALUES ARE PROGGED TO DECREASE
MARKEDLY OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS...DECREASING THE THREAT FOR
SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE. THE BEST CHANCES FOR
THUNDERSTORMS /PARTICULARLY STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS/ WILL BE
ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...WHICH WILL
BE CLOSEST TO THE FRONT AND WHERE INSTABILITY VALUES WILL BE
SLIGHTLY HIGHER. GIVEN THE FAIRLY STRONG BUT UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND
SHEAR...THE MAIN STORM TYPE WILL BE MULTICELL LINES/CLUSTERS...WITH
DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE PRIMARY THREAT. ADDITIONALLY...GIVEN
THE HIGHER PWAT VALUES ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE DEEP WARM
CLOUD LAYER NOTED ON MODEL SOUNDINGS...THE THREAT FOR SOME LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE ENHANSED SOMEWHAT ACROSS THIS AREA SHOULD
TRAINING BEGIN TO OCCUR WITH THE MORE INTENSE CELLS. FURTHER
NORTH AND EAST...THUNDER CHANCES ARE LOWER /PARTICULARLY GIVEN THE
WEAKER INSTABILITY PARAMETERS THERE/...THOUGH SOME ISOLATED TO
SCATTERED ACTIVITY CANNOT BE RULED OUT LATE TONIGHT. NO SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES TO THE FORECAST WERE NEEDED AND ONLY MINOR TWEAKS WERE MADE
TO POPS AND TEMPS.

ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...WITH A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDING 
FROM THE OZARKS REGION SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS CENTRAL AL AND CENTRAL 
GA. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVELY- 
INDUCED VORTEX OVER THE OZARKS REGION...WHICH IS EXPECTED TO TRIGGER 
A LARGE COMPLEX OF CONVECTION OVER THE MID SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD THEN MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD ALONG THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY TOWARDS SOUTHEAST TN TONIGHT...WITH CONVECTION 
BECOMING LIKELY OVER SOUTHEAST TN...ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH 
A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND STRENGTHENING MID-LEVEL WIND FLOW 
EXPECTED NEAR THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY...IT APPEARS THAT STRONG TO 
SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT INTO MONDAY. BOTH THE 
GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATE REDEVELOPMENT OF ANOTHER CONVECTIVE

THIS NEXT CONVECTIVE COMPLEX MAY AFFECT THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE

UNSTABLE AIR MASS POSSIBLY GENERATING SOME DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE 
HAIL...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. DRIER AIR IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR TUESDAY...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS SINCE A HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WITH 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT CONTINUING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...AND WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH OVER THE

342 AM EDT SAT JUN 2 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
ABNORMALLY LOW TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS WILL MAKE FOR A VERY PLEASANT DAY 
AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DROPS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
AFTER A MOSTLY CLEAR MORNING...500 MB TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO DROP 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL INCREASE THE COVERAGE OF STRATOCU 
CLOUDS...ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN AREAS. HIGHS WILL BE MAINLY IN THE 
UPPER 60S TO MID 70S TODAY. WITH THE TROUGH AXIS TO OUR EAST 
TONIGHT...TEMPS ALOFT GRADUALLY BEGIN TO WARM. THE NAM SHOWS 850 MB 
THETA-E ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT AT 300 K PRODUCING SOME 
SHOWERS TONIGHT...BUT THE GFS KEEPS US DRY. WILL GO WITH A DRY 
FORECAST TONIGHT GIVEN THE LACK OF MOISTURE DEPTH AND VERY WEAK LIFT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS
THROUGH THE CWA ON SUNDAY...WILL CONTINUE THE LOW POPS FOR THE AREA.
A TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THE REGION ON MONDAY BRINGING A BETTER
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE AREA. ANOTHER TROUGH
TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY SO WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCE FOR
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. ANOTHER TROUGH PUSHES THROUGH THE AREA
ON WEDNESDAY...SO WILL LEAVE LOW POPS FOR WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER TROUGH
IS INDICATED ON THURSDAY. WITH STILL UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING KEPT
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY DRY. STAYED NEAR HPC/MEX GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR
TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...
BASED ON CURRENT OBS AND TRENDS...HAVE MADE A FEW MINOR ADJUSTMENTS
TO THE FORECAST FOR TONIGHT.

IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT SWEPT THROUGH THE REGION EARLIER
TODAY...SOME BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS HAVE HELPED TO USHER IN A
COOL AIR MASS INTO THE AREA TO KICK OFF METEOROLOGICAL SUMMER.
THIS COOL AIR WILL HELP TO CONTRIBUTE TO BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES
OVERNIGHT AS LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE UPPER 40S TO THE LOWER 50S
AREAWIDE. SOME PARTIAL CLEARING HAS TAKEN PLACE OVER MUCH OF THE
GREAT TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS EVENING...WHICH HAS ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO DROP OFF A BIT FASTER THAN EXPECTED. HOWEVER...
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY AND SOUNDING DATA IS SHOWING A PLUME OF LOW-
LEVEL MOISTURE SWEEPING IN FROM THE MISSOURI AND MID-MISSISSIPPI
RIVER VALLEYS...HELPING TO MAINTAIN SOME SCT/BKN DECKS OF CLOUDS
OVERNIGHT. THUS...ONLY ADJUSTED TEMPS DOWNWARD BY A DEGREE OR TWO AS
THIS CLOUD COVER COMBINED WITH SOME MIXING SHOULD HELP TO KEEP THIS
COOLING IN CHECK SOMEWHAT. GIVEN THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER...HAVE
ADDED A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG IN THE VICINITY OF AREA LAKES AFTER
06Z...THOUGH THINK THAT IT MAY STILL BE FAIRLY MARGINAL GIVEN SOME
MIXING AND PERSISTENT CLOUD COVER.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A LINE OF STRONG CONVECTION OCCURRING 
ALONG IT OVER EXTREME NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. THIS COLD FRONT 
WILL EXIT THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS EVENING...WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR THE WEEKEND. TEMPS WILL BE 
BELOW NORMAL ON SATURDAY...BEFORE QUICKLY MODERATING BACK TO NORMAL 
ON SUNDAY. A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL LINGER OVER THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
LINGERING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. MODELS INDICATE 
SEVERAL UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVES QUICKLY MOVING THROUGH THE LONG WAVE 
TROUGH THIS WEEKEND...BUT DIFFER ON THE TIMING OF THE INDIVIDUAL 
SHORT WAVES. THUS...WILL MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...SINCE THE MODELS AGREE THAT THESE SHORT WAVES MAY TRIGGER 
A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND 
GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT 
AND LOOK REASONABLE. LARGE DISCREPANCIES APPEAR BETWEEN THE TWO SETS 
OF GUIDANCE FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...AND WILL COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE TWO FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL BRING 
A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION EARLY 
IN THE PERIOD. BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION WILL BE AN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE THAT WILL SLIDE IN MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. ANOTHER WEAK 
WAVE ROTATES IN ON WEDNESDAY FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF CONVECTION 
MAINLY OVER NORTHERN AND EASTERN LOCATIONS. WILL KEEP THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY DRY WITH MOST ACTIVITY EXPECTED TO STAY TO OUR NORTHEAST. AS

LINE OF CONVECTION STRENGTHENING ALONG IT. THIS COLD FRONT IS 
PROGGED TO EXIT THE FORECAST AREA AROUND 18Z THIS AFTERNOON...BUT

MISSISSIPPI RIVERS. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY THIS EVENING... 
WITH ITS ASSOCIATED STRONG COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVING ACROSS THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A VERY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS WILL DEVELOP OVER WEST AND MIDDLE TN THIS AFTERNOON...WITH 
INSTABILITY DECREASING FURTHER EAST OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS A 
RESULT...ANY STRONG TO SEVERE CONVECTION OVER THE WESTERN TN RIVER 
VALLEY SHOULD WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EASTWARD THIS EVENING...BUT THIS 
CONVECTION MAY HAVE ENOUGH ORGANIZATION TO CONTINUE MOVING INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL LATER THIS EVENING

AND LIFT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE ALONG THE COLD FRONT LATE 
TONIGHT...AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AFTER SUNRISE ON 
FRIDAY MORNING BETWEEN 12 AND 18 UTC. A FAIRLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON FRIDAY MORNING... 
WHICH WILL CREATE A FAIRLY STRONG WIND FIELD FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 
THUS...IT APPEARS THAT TWO ROUNDS OF SEVERE WEATHER COULD AFFECT THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE NEXT 24 HOURS...ONE ROUND THIS EVENING AND 
THE NEXT ONE AROUND SUNRISE AND THEREAFTER ON FRIDAY MORNING. THE 
MAIN THREATS APPEAR TO BE DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL...BUT AN 
ISOLATED TORNADO APPEARS TO BE POSSIBLE WITH THE DECENT WIND FIELD 
OCCURRING ALONG THIS STRONG COLD FRONT. THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD 
QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON...WITH 
UNSEASONABLY COOL AIR MOVING IN BEHIND IT FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH MINS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...AND WILL TREND TOWARDS 
THE WARMER NAM MAXES WHICH HAVE BEEN VERIFYING BETTER LATELY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH MAY 
ROTATE IN A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORM INTO PORTIONS OF THE 
MRX CWA SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE CENTRAL U.S. 
EARLY IN THE WEEK...PUTTING THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION IN 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. A SERIES OVER SHORT WAVES AND BOUNDARIES WILL 
MOVE THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW...PROVIDING US WITH OCCASIONAL 
CONVECTION MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. STRONGEST SYSTEM WILL MOVE IN 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. MODELS STILL SHOW DISCREPANCIES IN TIMING 
BUT HAVE TRENDED FASTER WITH THE SYSTEM AND BROUGHT IN HIGHER POPS 
TUESDAY NIGHT. LEFT THURSDAY DRY WITH ONLY A WEAK IMPULSE PROGGED

CUMBERLAND PLATEAU UNTIL THE MID TO LATE AFTERNOON...WITH THE BEST 
CHANCES OCCURRING AFTER 00-06Z AS THE MAIN COLD FRONT APPROACHES AND 
PUSHES ACROSS THE AREA. THE SPEED OF THIS SYSTEM AND THE TIMING OF 
THIS FRONT WILL HAVE A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT IMPACT ON THE SEVERE 
WEATHER POTENTIAL FOR LATER THIS EVENING.

PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS HAD BEEN INDICATING A REASONABLE SHOT FOR AN 
ELEVATED SEVERE WEATHER THREAT /PARTICULARLY DAMAGING STRAIGHT-LINE 
WINDS/ FROM AN MCS FEATURE PROGGED TO MOVE OUT OF THE OHIO 
VALLEY/MID-SOUTH TOWARD THE REGION DURING THE EVENING. HOWEVER...WITH 
A SLOWER MOVING SYSTEM...THE WINDOW OF OPPORTUNITY FOR A WIDESPREAD 
SEVERE WEATHER EVENT ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE MAY BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED 
AS INSTABILITY VALUES DECREASE SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 03Z OR SO. 
THUS...DESPITE THE FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS 
STORM SYSTEM FOR LATE MAY/EARLY JUNE...IT IS CONCEIVABLE THAT AN 
OVERALL WEAKENING TREND WITH THIS ACTIVITY WILL OCCUR AS IT PUSHES 
INTO THE AREA DURING THE LATE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS. THE MOST 
FAVORED AREAS FOR THUNDERSTORMS AND THE ASSOCIATED SEVERE WEATHER 
THREAT WILL BE ACROSS THE WESTERN ZONES/CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THAT 
COULD EXPERIENCE SOME CONVECTION DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY 
EVENING. HOWEVER...MODELS SEEM TO AGREE THAT A BULK OF THE ACTIVITY 
WILL IMPACT THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 06Z ON FRIDAY /AFTER INSTABLITY 
VALUES HAVE DECREASED/. 

BASED ON THIS THINKING...HAVE SCALED BACK MENTIONABLE POPS SOMEWHAT 
TODAY /REMOVING THEM COMPLETELY FROM THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA PRIOR TO 18Z/...BEFORE GRADUALLY RAMPING THEM UP 
DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS /WITH THE MOST 
FAVORED AREAS BEEN ACROSS THE WESTERN ZONES/. IT SHOULD BE NOTED 
THAT GIVEN THE STRONG WIND SHEAR IN PLACE /WITH 0-1 KM VALUES AOA 
20-25 KTS AND 0-6 KM SHEAR VALUES AOA 40-45 KTS/...SOME STRONG AND 
FAIRLY ORGANIZED/LONG-LIVED STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE SHOULD THEY BE 
ABLE TO TAP INTO THE HIGHER INSTABILITY THAT WILL BE IN PLACE ACROSS 
THE AREA EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON/EVENING. THUS...THE THREAT FOR 
DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS/HAIL...AND EVEN AN ISOLATED TORNADO 
WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THIS ACTIVITY DEPENDING ON HOW THE TIMING 
SHAKES OUT LATER TODAY. BUT...GIVEN THESE UNCERTAINTIES/LIMITING 
FACTORS...EXACTLY HOW WIDESPREAD THIS THREAT WILL BE IS STILL 
UNCLEAR ATTM.  


.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
MAIN CHANGE HAS BEEN THE SLOWER TIMING OF THE UPPER LOW/TROUGH AND
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY. I INCREASED POPS IN THE 12Z TO 16Z
GRIDS ON FRIDAY TO RELFECT THE SLOWER TIMING...BUT KEPT POPS
FALLING TO SLIGHT CHANCE W TO CHANCE E BY THE MID TO LATE
AFTERNOON. THE THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS HAS LOWERED
SIGNIFICANTLY...AS TSRA ARRIVE VERY LATE THURSDAY NIGHT WELL AFTER
BEST INSTABILITY HAS OCCURRED. THE SHEAR AND LIFT REMAIN POTENT FOR
FRIDAY MORNING...HENCE THE HIGH LIKELY TO LOW CATEGORICAL
POPS...BUT AIRMASS DOES NOT DESTABILIZE AGAIN UNTIL THE CONVECTION
IS ALMOST EAST OF OUR REGION. THIS LEAVES BEST FOCUS FOR SEVERE
STORMS OVER THE CAROLINAS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...I WILL
MENTION STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE FRIDAY MORNING IN THE HWO
PRODUCT...WITH MAIN THREATS UP TO LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS FOR
NE TN AND SW VA.

OTHERWISE...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT AND IN LINE WITH 
PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. MOSTLY DRY OVER THE WEEKEND BEHIND THE EXIT 
OF FRIDAY'S SYSTEM. TOUGH TO PIN DOWN DETAILS FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY
AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE PLAINS AND MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION.
THIS PLACES OUR AREA IN NW FLOW ALOFT...BUT MODELS CONTINUE TO 
DIFFER ON TRACK AND TIMING OF POTENTIAL MESOSCALE CONVECTION...WHICH 
COULD OCCUR BOTH DIURNALLY AND NOCTURNALLY. PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKED 
REASONABLE WITH LITTLE CHANGES FOR NOW. GFSX MOS CONTINUES TO OFFER 
BEST POPS FOR TUESDAY...SO KEPT DECENT CHANCE POPS FOR THAT PERIOD. 
GFSX MOS TEMPS ARE FLUCTUATING A BIT FROM 12Z TO 00Z RUN...MAINLY ON 
HIGHS FOR MONDAY THRU WEDNESDAY. BLENDED WARMER HIGHS FOR THOSE DAYS 
IN WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS...AND MADE A FEW TWEAKS ELSEWHERE ON MAX/MIN 
TEMPS TO FIT BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH THE CENTER OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION BERYL 
ALONG THE NC COAST NEAR THE OUTER BANKS. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
SHOULD SLOWLY DRIFT TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT...WITH A 
WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE COMBINING TO POSSIBLY TRIGGERING SOME 
ISOLATED CONVECTION TONIGHT...MAINLY OVER SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST 
TN...AND THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY OVER THE 
PLAINS TONIGHT...WHICH WILL THEN STRENGTHEN A SURFACE LOW OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS LOW IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS 
THE OZARKS ON THURSDAY MORNING...AND THEN OVER THE LOWER OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE 
FAIRLY STRONG FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...WITH A DECENT WIND FIELD 
ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THUS...EXPECT ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP 
OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY THURSDAY EVENING AHEAD OF ITS ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT. SOME PRE-FRONTAL ACTIVITY COULD BEGIN TO AFFECT THE 
FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY EVENING...BUT IT APPEARS THE BEST 
INSTABILITY AND LIFT WILL BE ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AROUND 12 UTC ON FRIDAY MORNING. DUE TO 
THE STRENGTH OF THIS SYSTEM...WILL PLAN TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SEVERE STORMS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING IN THE ZONE 
FORECASTS. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...WITH UNSEASONABLY COOL AIR MOVING IN 
BEHIND IT FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL TREND 
TOWARDS THE SLIGHTLY WARMER NAM MINS AND WARMER GFS MAXES WHICH HAVE 
BEEN VERIFYING BETTER LATELY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODEL SOLUTIONS RELATIVELY 
CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST WHICH FEATURES A 
CLOSED LOW AND MEAN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH EXTENDING FROM THE GREAT 
LAKES INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. THIS PATTERN WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES 
FROM SKY ROCKETING OUT OF CONTROL WITH AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF 
NORTHERLY STEERING FLOW. IN ADDITION...THERE WILL BE A CHANCE FOR A 
FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MAINLY IN NORTHERN PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS A COUPLE OF WEAK SHORT WAVES 
BUILD SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. A SLIGHTLY STRONGER 
WAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY SO THERE 
WILL BE A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PROBABILITY FOR THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE AREA. FOR THE NEW DAY SEVEN (WEDNESDAY) ALSO ADDED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER DISTURBANCE 
MOVING ACROSS THE REGION IN THE PERSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW OVER THE 
EASTERN U.S. STAYED RATHER CLOSE TO MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT 
THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/... 
THE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAT ACCOMPANIED A COLD FRONTAL
PASSAGE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HAVE PUSHED WELL TO THE
SOUTHEAST OF THE AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. IN THEIR WAKE...SOME
CLEARING WILL BEGIN TO OCCUR FROM WEST TO EAST...THOUGH SOME OF THE
CLOUD COVER MAY LINGER ACROSS EASTERN/NORTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE LATE MORNING HOURS. ADDITIONALLY...GIVEN
THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER THAT IS IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION...SOME
FOG DEVELOPMENT HAS OCCURRED IN SOME OF THE USUAL SHELTERED AREAS
AND NEAR LAKES/RIVERS. THUS...HAVE INTRODUCED LOCALIZED PATCHY FOG
IN THESE LOCATIONS THROUGH 12Z TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. AFTER
SUNRISE...THE FOG WILL DISSIPATE AND WITH ZONAL FLOW PREVAILING
ALOFT...A BEAUTIFUL FAIR WEATHER DAY IS EXPECTED WITH ABUNDANT
SUNSHINE YIELDING WARM TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S BY THE
AFTERNOON.

OVERNIGHT...A DEVELOPING UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM AND ITS 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL BEGIN TO TRACK TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY AND EVENTUALLY THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BY THURSDAY. MODELS HAVE 
MAINTAINED SOME WEAK QPF SIGNALS LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT PUSHING INTO 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AREA FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE BEFORE 12Z. 
SO...HAVE ADDED LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS TO THIS AREA AFTER 06Z. 
HOWEVER...GENERALLY DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT...WITH MOST OF 
THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IMPACTING THE REGION THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
WETTEST SYSTEM FOR THESE PERIODS STILL LOOKS TO BE THURSDAY NIGHT
AND FRIDAY...AS A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT APPROACH.
TIMING LOOKS MORE LIKE LATE AFTERNOON IN WRN AREAS AND THE EVENING
HOURS AND OVERNIGHT IN THE ERN AREAS. I ADJUSTED POPS TO BETTER
REFLECT THIS TIMING. SHEAR AND INSTABILITY SHOULD SUPPORT STRONG TO
SEVERE STORMS...AT LEAST THROUGH ABOUT 04Z FRIDAY.

MOST...IF NOT ALL...MODELS SUPPORT A DRY FORECAST SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY...SO POPS WERE ONLY KEPT FOR SATURDAY MORNING. UPPER RIDGE 
AXIS SHOULD BE TO OUR WEST BY MONDAY...WITH SOME DIFFERING ON HOW 
STRONG THE RIDGE IS. OUR FORECAST AREA SHOULD BE UNDER NW FLOW ALOFT 
WITH POTENTIAL FOR MCS TO DEVELOP AND PASS ACROSS OR NEAR OUR 
REGION. FOR NOW...I KEPT JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AND

THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. WILL UPDATE ZONES TO REMOVE 
MORNING WORDING. NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FORECAST AREA STILL UNDER
INFLUENCE OF RIDGING THIS MORNING...WITH MILD TEMPS IN THE 60S TO
MID 70S. SPOTTY WEAK SHOWERS OVER WRN NC...ASSOCIATED WITH FLOW
AROUND REMNANTS OF BERYL...HAD DISSIPATED. SOME CONVECTION WAS
DEVELOPING JUST AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT...STILL WELL TO
OUR WEST. I LOWERED RAIN CHANCES FOR EARLY TO MID MORNING HOURS...
AND DROPPED THUNDER FOR THOSE PERIODS. SOME FORCING DOES DEVELOP
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE. HOWEVER...
INSTABILITY EASILY REACHES 1000 TO 1500 J/KG...AND THE WARM AIR
ALOFT WILL HAVE LESSENED MAKING FOR A WEAKER CAP.

OPTED TO KEEP SOME LIKELY POPS GOING FOR GENERALLY ALL AREAS BUT SE
TN...WHERE MOS POPS ARE THE LOWEST FOR TODAY. PROXIMITY OF BERYL
CIRCULATION AND THE WEAK COLD FRONT...SUPPORTS AT LEAST SCATTERED
CONVECTION THIS EVENING. PREVIOUS POPS WERE VERY CLOSE TO A MOS
BLEND...BUT I DID NUDGE POPS UP A BIT FOR SW VA AND NE TN TO MESH
BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. HAS BEEN HOT AND DRY FOR SEVERAL
DAYS SO RAIN SHOULD BE WELCOMED BY MOST FOLKS.

FOR TEMPS...CURRENT TEMPS MILD TO WARM SO ANY DELAY IN CONVECTION
DEVELOPING WOULD SUPPORT THE WARMER MOS MAXES. RECORDS ARE NOT IN
JEOPARDY...(CHA - 99...TYS - 95 AND TRI - 90). MOS BLEND OF SIMILAR
LOWS LOOKED GOOD AND CLOSE TO PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN
FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD CONTINUES TO BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES
ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM DURING THE LATTER PART
OF THE WORK WEEK.

AS THE REMNANTS OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION BERYL SHOOT NORTHEASTWARD OFF 
THE CAROLINA COAST BY THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...DRY CONDITIONS ARE 
EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY AS GENERALLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL PREVAIL. 
FAIRLY LOW INSTABILITY VALUES AND CAPPING SHOULD PROHIBIT MOST

405 AM EDT TUE MAY 29 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FORECAST AREA STILL UNDER
INFLUENCE OF RIDGING THIS MORNING...WITH MILD TEMPS IN THE 60S TO
MID 70S. SPOTTY WEAK SHOWERS OVER WRN NC...ASSOCIATED WITH FLOW
AROUND REMNANTS OF BERYL...HAD DISSIPATED. SOME CONVECTION WAS
DEVELOPING JUST AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT...STILL WELL TO
OUR WEST. I LOWERED RAIN CHANCES FOR EARLY TO MID MORNING HOURS...
AND DROPPED THUNDER FOR THOSE PERIODS. SOME FORCING DOES DEVELOP
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE. HOWEVER...
INSTABILITY EASILY REACHES 1000 TO 1500 J/KG...AND THE WARM AIR
ALOFT WILL HAVE LESSENED MAKING FOR A WEAKER CAP.

OPTED TO KEEP SOME LIKELY POPS GOING FOR GENERALLY ALL AREAS BUT SE
TN...WHERE MOS POPS ARE THE LOWEST FOR TODAY. PROXIMITY OF BERYL
CIRCULATION AND THE WEAK COLD FRONT...SUPPORTS AT LEAST SCATTERED
CONVECTION THIS EVENING. PREVIOUS POPS WERE VERY CLOSE TO A MOS
BLEND...BUT I DID NUDGE POPS UP A BIT FOR SW VA AND NE TN TO MESH
BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. HAS BEEN HOT AND DRY FOR SEVERAL
DAYS SO RAIN SHOULD BE WELCOMED BY MOST FOLKS.

FOR TEMPS...CURRENT TEMPS MILD TO WARM SO ANY DELAY IN CONVECTION
DEVELOPING WOULD SUPPORT THE WARMER MOS MAXES. RECORDS ARE NOT IN
JEOPARDY...(CHA - 99...TYS - 95 AND TRI - 90). MOS BLEND OF SIMILAR
LOWS LOOKED GOOD AND CLOSE TO PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN
FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD CONTINUES TO BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES
ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM DURING THE LATTER PART
OF THE WORK WEEK.

AS THE REMNANTS OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION BERYL SHOOT NORTHEASTWARD OFF 
THE CAROLINA COAST BY THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...DRY CONDITIONS ARE 
EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY AS GENERALLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL PREVAIL. 
FAIRLY LOW INSTABILITY VALUES AND CAPPING SHOULD PROHIBIT MOST 
DIURNAL CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HOWEVER...ON 
THURSDAY AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL SWING OUT OF THE CENTRAL 
ROCKIES ONTO THE GREAT PLAINS AND TOWARD TENNESSEE VALLEY...PUSHING 
A COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION AND BRINGING THE AREA A FAIRLY DECENT 
SHOT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH EARLY

VERY LIKELY THAT THESE SHOWERS AFFECT ANY SITE OTHER THAN TRI AT

CONDITIONS BECOME MORE FAVORABLE FOR CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION FROM

PRECIPITATION WITH A FAIRLY DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE TODAY. BUT NOT 
CONFIDANT ABOUT THE COVERAGE FOR THIS AFTERNOON TO REMOVE 
PRECIPITATION...SO WILL GO WITH CONTINUITY AND LEAVE THE CURRENT 
RAIN CHANCES AS IS FOR TODAY. NEAR RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES AND THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. NO CHANGES NEEDED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...REGION STILL UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
OF THE STRONG UPPER RIDGE...WITH T.S. BERYL WEAKENING SOME AS IT 
MOVES ACROSS NRN FL AND SE GA. I GENERALLY FOUND THE NAM/GFS/SREF 
ALL TOO WET FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AS I DON'T THINK THAT 
THE AIR MASS OVER THE SRN APPALACHIANS WILL CHANGE MUCH FROM 
YESTERDAY. ECMWF OFFERS A DRIER LOOK AND FITS WELL WITH OFFICIAL 
TRACK OF T.S. BERYL...SO I PREFER TO TREND MUCH CLOSER TO ECMWF FOR 
THE SHORT TERM. I DID KEEP CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS...HAVING 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE BOARD FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT.
HOWEVER...I EXPECT OVERALL ANY TSRA COVERAGE TO BE 10 PERCENT OR SO
...EXCEPT FOR PERHAPS SW NC (WHERE POPS WHERE NUDGED UP TO VERY LOW 
CHANCE). 

A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER SHOULD KEEP MAX TEMPS JUST A TAD 
BELOW RECORDS FOR TODAY...CHA - 95...TYS - 94 AND TRI - 92. KEEPING 
THOSE LOW POPS FOR TONIGHT WITH VERY MILD TEMPS IN THE 60S TO LOWER 
70S. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MOISTURE INCREASE TUESDAY
WITH TS OR TD BERYL HAS MOVED NORTH INTO GA AND SC WITH DEEPEST
MOISTURE ALONG THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN CREST EASTWARD. ALSO A COLD
FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH THAT WILL BE APPROACHING THE OHIO VALLEY
WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR MORE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY AND
MORE CLOUDS. KEPT LIKELY POPS OVER NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE
REGION AND HIGH CHANCE SOUTH. TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES COOLER
THAN TODAY BUT STILL ABOVE NORMAL. MODELS SHOW BEST COVERAGE OF
CONVECTION NORTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY THEN
SHIFTING TO THE NE IN VA AND NC TUESDAY EVENING. BERYL WILL GET
CAUGHT UP WITH THE TROUGH AND LIFTED NE THROUGH THE CAROLINAS
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. SHOWERS END TUESDAY NIGHT AND SKIES
CLEAR WEDNESDAY.

WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE COLD FRONT WILL BECOME STATIONARY ALONG THE TN
AND GA BORDER. CLOUDS INCREASE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS A
NEW LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS. THE SURFACE LOW THEN GETS WOUND
UP AND TRIES TO BECOME CLOSED OFF BY FRIDAY AS UPPER TROUGH DIGS
SOUTH ACROSS THE PLAINS. SHOWERS BECOME LIKELY AGAIN THURSDAY NIGHT
AND FRIDAY AS STRONG SHORTWAVE MOVES EAST ACROSS THE TN AND OH
VALLEYS. MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL PREVAIL BEHIND THIS SECOND
FRONT FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. MODELS CLOSE OFF TROUGH TO AN
UPPER LOW FRIDAY MORNING OVER THE UPPER MS VALLEY AND MOVE IT
SLOWLY EAST INTO THE NORTHEAST BY LATE SUNDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND
DEEP TROUGH WILL BRING SUNNY SKIES BACK TO THE REGION LATER
SATURDAY AND CONTINUE THROUGH SUNDAY. LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE AREA BEGINS TO WEAKEN AND PULL EAST ON MONDAY. T.S. BERYL 
MOVES WEST INTO NE FL TONIGHT AND BEGINS TO WEAKEN MONDAY INLAND 
OVER S GA. UPPER DEFORMATION ZONE SETS UP OVER AREA MONDAY AFTERNOON 
AS UPPER RIDGE SPLITS WITH INFLUENCE OF BERYL NUDGING NW WHILE UPPER 
TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE NW. AIRMASS REMAINS RELATIVELY DRY BUT 
ISOLATED AFTN CONVECTION HAS A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE THAN RECENT 
DAYS. JET CORE IN NORTHERN TROUGH MOVES INTO THE OH VALLEY ON 
TUESDAY WITH INCREASED WESTERLY STEERING FLOW ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. 
THIS WILL ALLOW FOR ONGOING PREFRONTAL CONVECTION TO MARCH INTO THE 
AREA MUCH OF TUESDAY. THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SE INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY NIGHT. WARM TEMPERATURES CONTINUE THROUGH 
THE PERIOD THOUGH NOT AS WARM AS THE WEEKEND AFTERNOONS. DEW POINTS 
WILL RISE IN ADVANCE OF THE APPROACHING FRONT.


.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FRONT LINGERS OVER THE 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY. WITH AN AMPLE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL 
CONTINUE THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER FRONT ENTERS THE REGION IN THE THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY TIME FRAME...SO WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THE FRONT MAY LINGER INTO 
SATURDAY MORNING...SO KEEP LOW CHANCES OF SHOWERS FOR SATURDAY. HIGH 
PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY. STAYED NEAR 
MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...27/00Z NAM MODEL APPEARS TO BE 
OVERDOING MOISTURE AND DEVELOPING TOO MUCH CONVECTION TODAY. 00Z 
UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW THE RIDGING VERY PERSISTENT...WHILE WATER VAPOR 
SATELLITE PICS SHOW A DRY AIR MASS OVER THE SRN APPALACHIANS AND 
MOST OF THE GULF COAST STATES. THUS...I FAVOR THE MUCH LOWER GFS MOS 
POPS WITH ONLY TSRA CHANCES (SLIM) ALONG THE ERN MOST MTNS...WHERE 
JUST ENOUGH WEAK CONVERGENCE COULD OVERCOME THE CAPPING WARM AIR 
ALOFT. HOWEVER...ANY CONVECTION WOULD BE WEAK AND SHORT-LIVED...SO I 
CHOSE TO DROP POPS FOR THIS EVENING (WHICH ALSO MESHES QUITE WELL 
WITH NEIGHBORING NWS GRIDS). 

OTHERWISE...EXPECT HIGHS TODAY VERY CLOSE TO OR JUST A DEGREE OR SO 
ABOVE SATURDAY'S MAX TEMPS...WHICH WILL BE NEAR RECORD HIGHS ACROSS 
THE BOARD...(CHA - 95...TYS - 94 AND TRI - 89). STILL FAVORING THE
SLIGHTLY COOLER MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT DUE TO DRYNESS OF AIR MASS...
SOIL AND BOUNDARY LAYER. 

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL START 
OUT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA EARLY MONDAY AS WEAKENING TROPICAL 
SYSTEM SPINS OVER NORTH FL AND SOUTHERN GA. LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE 
CANADA AND US BORDER WITH COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS VALLEY WILL 
CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST MONDAY. MOISTURE FROM THIS SYTEM APPROACHES 
THE OHIO VALLEY BY MONDAY EVENING. SOME MOISTURE FROM TROPICAL 
SYSTEM MAY MOVE INTO EXTREME SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA 
BY 00Z TUESDAY BUT MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL ENCOUNTER ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DUE TO DAYTIME HEATING. WILL CONTINUE 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS. TEMPERATURES LOWER A COUPLE 
DEGREES FROM TODAY BUT STILL NEAR 90. MONDAY NIGHT KEEP SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS OVERNIGHT AS COOL FRONT APPROACHES AND TROPICAL MOISTURE 
INCREASES FROM THE SOUTH AND EAST. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY AHEAD OF FRONT AND LEFTOVERS OF EXITING 
TROPICAL SYSTEM AND MAINLY NE HALF WITH LIKELY POPS THERE CHANCE 
ELSEWHERE. FRONT MOVING FASTER THAN EARLIER MODEL RUNS WITH SHOWERS 
POSSIBLY OUT BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. REST OF WEDNESDAY LOOKS DRIER SO 
REMOVED POPS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT DRY AND COOLER WITH LOWS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS IN THE 50S. THURSDAY UPPER TROUGH DIGS FARTHER SOUTH OVER 
THE EASTERN STATES AND NEW FRONTAL SYSTEM BRINGS RENEWED SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM CHANCES OVER THE REGION. GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AS THE NEW SYSTEM MOVES SLOWLY EAST. EVEN 
DEEPER TROUGH SETTLES OVER FORECAST AREA SATURDAY. IMPROVING 
CONDITIONS SATURDAY AND EVEN LOWER TEMPERATURES THEN FRIDAY. HIGHS 
ONLY IN THE 60S MOUNTAINS AND NE AND 70S CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS.

TEMPERATURES AT OR NEAR RECORD VALUES SO NO NEED TO BUMP HIGHER. 
ISOLATED CONVECTION POSSIBLE ACROSS SW VA/NE TN AND SMOKIES. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG RIDGING ACROSS THE REGION 
AGAIN WILL PROVIDE ANOTHER MOSTLY DRY AND HOT DAY. A FEW DEGREES 
WARMER EACH DAY HAS BEEN THE TREND OF LATE...AND ALLOWING FOR THIS 
SHOULD LET RECORD HIGHS BE IN JEOPARDY...(CHA/TYS - 94...TRI - 89 
AND OQT - 88).

INVERSION PLUS EXTREMELY WEAK WINDS ALOFT. THUS...I OPTED TO TRIM 
POPS BACK AND MAINLY LIMIT TO HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA AND NE TN DOWN 
TO THE SMOKIES. THIS MESHES GENERALLY WELL WITH NEIGHBORING NWS 
OFFICES TO OUR EAST...BUT I WILL KEEP THE EVENING GRIDS DRY FOR NOW 
AND LET DAY SHIFT MONITOR TO SEE IF CONVECTION CAN DEVELOP AT ALL.

MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT AND THE DRY AIRMASS HAS BEEN FAVORING THE 
COOLER MOS MINS...SO LOWS WERE KEPT NEAR THE COOLER GFS MOS.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST STATES SHOULD STAY IN CONTROL ONE MORE DAY EVEN AS 
TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVES SLOWLY SE TOWARD THE GA AND FL COASTS. AIR 
MASS BECOMES MODERATELY UNSTABLE BUT STILL MIGHT BE CAPPED. ANOTHER 
VERY WARM DAY IS FORECAST WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR 90 TO THE LOWER 
90S. NOT MUCH CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN SUNDAY NIGHT MOISTURE 
INCREASES AS TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO FL AND GA. INCLUDED SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT. 
MONDAY THERE SHOULD BE INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND NOT QUITE AS 
UNSTABLE HOWEVER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD DEVELOP AT ANY 
TIME. TUESDAY COLD FRONT APPROACHES. AIR MASS BECOMES MORE UNSTABLE 
WITH INCREASED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. THERE WILL BE 
INCREASED MOISTURE FROM THE TROPICAL SYSTEM THAT IS TO THE SOUTH OF 
THE REGION TOO. SOME STORMS COULD BE STRONG. SCATTERED SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS THE FRONT 
MOVES SLOWLY ACROSS THE REGION. WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY THERE 
COULD BE A BRIEF DRY PERIOD BEFORE A SECONDARY SYSTEM SPREADS MORE 
RAIN INTO THE TN VALLEY LATE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. UPPER TROUGH WILL

OFFICES TO OUR EAST...BUT I WILL KEEP THE EVENING GRIDS DRY FOR NOW 
AND LET DAY SHIFT MONITOR TO SEE IF CONVECTION CAN DEVELOP AT ALL.

MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT AND THE DRY AIRMASS HAS BEEN FAVORING THE 
COOLER MOS MINS...SO LOWS WERE KEPT NEAR THE COOLER GFS MOS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE
SOUTHEAST STATES SHOULD STAY IN CONTROL ONE MORE DAY EVEN AS
TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVES SLOWLY SE TOWARD THE GA AND FL COASTS. AIR
MASS BECOMES MODERATELY UNSTABLE BUT STILL MIGHT BE CAPPED. ANOTHER
VERY WARM DAY IS FORECAST WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR 90 TO THE LOWER
90S. NOT MUCH CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN SUNDAY NIGHT MOISTURE
INCREASES AS TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO FL AND GA. INCLUDED SLIGHT
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT.
MONDAY THERE SHOULD BE INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND NOT QUITE AS
UNSTABLE HOWEVER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD DEVELOP AT ANY
TIME. TUESDAY COLD FRONT APPROACHES. AIR MASS BECOMES MORE UNSTABLE
WITH INCREASED SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. THERE WILL BE
INCREASED MOISTURE FROM THE TROPICAL SYSTEM THAT IS TO THE SOUTH OF
THE REGION TOO. SOME STORMS COULD BE STRONG. SCATTERED SHOWER AND
THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS THE
FRONT MOVES SLOWLY ACROSS THE REGION. WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY
THERE COULD BE A BRIEF DRY PERIOD BEFORE A SECONDARY SYSTEM SPREADS
MORE RAIN INTO THE TN VALLEY LATE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. UPPER TROUGH
WILL DIG SOUTH OVER THE FORECAST AREA AS WELL. TEMPERATURES WILL
STAY ABOVE NORMAL MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY AND THEN COOL SOME
THURSDAY AND MUCH COOLER FRIDAY.

FROM THE LOWER MS RVR VLY THROUGH THE TN VLY AND INTO THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS. THIS FEATURE WILL CHANGE SLIGHTLY THROUGH THE PERIOD 
BECOMING STRONGER OVER THE CNTRL APPS. LAYER THICKNESS VALUES 
CONTINUE TO RISE ON SATURDAY WITH H85 TEMPS APPROACHING 20C. NEAR 
RECORD HIGHS FOR SAT. A WEAK SHORT WAVE OVER IL WILL CONTINUE EAST 
THIS EVENING. LAYER RELATIVE HUMIDITY AND AFTN MOUNTAIN CONVECTION 
WILL RISE SOME ON SAT AS THE MOISTURE FROM THIS FEATURE RISE OVER 
AND THEN DOWN EAST SIDE OF RIDGE. DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE ATLANTIC IS PROGGED TO MOVE SW TO NEAR NE FL/SE GA COAST BY 
SUN MORNING. THIS WILL INCREASE THE LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND 
MOISTURE ADVECTION ACROSS THE CAROLINAS AND BRING A CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION ACROSS EASTERN AREAS FOR SUNDAY AFTN. THICKNESS VALUES 
LOWER SLIGHTLY ON SUNDAY AND WITH SOME CLOUD COVER...NOT AS 
CONFIDENT WITH VERY WARM HIGHS WHICH WILL APPROACH RECORDS.   


.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A SUMMER PATTERN CONTINUES INTO 
MONDAY. MOISTURE IS LIMITED SO WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST FOR THE  
HIGHER TERRAIN. A FRONT TRACKS INTO THE AREA FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND LIFT PROVIDING A BETTER 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE AREA ON TUESDAY AND

ISOLATED SHOWERS AND AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY OVER FAR 
NORTHERN AND EASTERN LOCATIONS.  OTHERWISE...WILL TRANSITION INTO A

WILL BE THE MAIN STORY WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S COMMON PLACE. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE MARGINALLY UNSTABLE WITH ONLY A WEAK CAP...SO 
STILL EXPECT ISOLATED-WIDELY SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
CONVECTION OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS EACH DAY. THE VALLEY SHOULD 
STAY GENERALLY DRY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO PULL 
AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TODAY.  COULD SEE A FEW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY OVER FAR 
NORTHERN AND EASTERN LOCATIONS.  OTHERWISE...WILL TRANSITION INTO A 
RELATIVELY DRY AND HOT WEATHER PATTERN.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL BE THE MAIN 
THEME FOR THE EXTENDED BETWEEN FRIDAY AND MONDAY. HOT AFTERNOONS 
WILL BE THE MAIN STORY WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S COMMON PLACE. 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE MARGINALLY UNSTABLE WITH ONLY A WEAK CAP...SO 
STILL EXPECT ISOLATED-WIDELY SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
CONVECTION OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS EACH DAY. THE VALLEY SHOULD 
STAY GENERALLY DRY.

FOR TUESDAY...UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN ALLOWING A COLD FRONT TO MOVE 
INTO THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING. WILL UP POPS TO 
CHANCE AREA-WIDE WITH STILL HIGHER POPS OVER THE TERRAIN. 

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS TEMPERATURES/POPS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE 
CAROLINAS...WITH A WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
RADARS REVEAL THAT MOST OF THE EARLIER CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY HAS 
DIMINISHED...WITH NOT MUCH REDEVELOPMENT EXPECTED OVERNIGHT AS AN 
UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE CAROLINAS GRADUALLY WEAKENS. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY REVEALS QUITE A BIT OF CLOUDS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS EVENING...BUT THINK THESE CLOUDS SHOULD DIMINISH OVERNIGHT 
ALLOWING FOR SOME PATCHY FOG TO DEVELOP AFTER MIDNIGHT. TEMPS SHOULD 
FALL CLOSE TO THE CURRENT DEWPOINTS BY SUNRISE...SINCE NO DRY AIR 
ADVECTION IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THIS EVENING TO REMOVE ANY MENTION OF 
PRECIP...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.AVIATION...ISOLATED CONVECTION STILL WANDERING AROUND TYS EARLY
THIS EVENING BUT WOULD EXPECT LITTLE IN THE WAY OF PRECIP AT ANY OF
THE TERMINALS BEYOND 02Z WITH LOSS OF INSOLATION. APPLIED SOME MVFR
FOG AT TYS LATE NITE WITH IFR REDUCTION AT TRI IN THE STILL HUMID
AIRMASS PRESENT ACROSS THE REGION. CONVECTION BECOMES LESS EVIDENT
ACROSS THE REGION ON THURSDAY AS UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO DRIFT JUST
A LITTLE FARTHER TO THE NORTHEAST. MODELS INDICATE THERE MAY BE A

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER LOW OVER SW NC WILL 
WEAKEN TONIGHT AND MOVE NORTHEAST ON THURSDAY. SCATTERED 
CONVECTION...AIDED BY AFTERNOON HEATING WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING 
...MAINLY OVER NE AREAS. ISOLATED SHOWER ACTIVITY POSSIBLE 
OVERNIGHT. LESS CLOUD COVER EXPECTED OVERNIGHT ALLOWING FOR BETTER 
CHANCE OF LATE NIGHT STRATUS AND FOG FORMATION. PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES CONTINUE THURSDAY OVER NE AREAS NORTH OF UPPER TROUGH AXIS. 
MID LEVELS WILL BE DRIER OF WEST SIDE OF DEPARTING TROUGH FOR SW 
AREAS. LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMES INCREASINGLY SOUTHWESTERLY EARLY 
THURSDAY WILL ONSET OF RISING THICKNESS VALUES. NEAR NORMAL 
TEMPERATURE TONIGHT WITH ABOVE NORMAL READING AND MORE SUNSHINE 
THURSDAY. 

.LONG TERM...
THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW THAT HAS CONTROLLED THE WEATHER ACROSS THE 
REGION FOR THE BETTER PART OF THE WORK WEEK WILL FINALLY MOVE WELL 
INTO THE CHESAPEAKE BAY REGION BY 00Z FRIDAY. IN ITS WAKE...A 
STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL PUSH EASTWARD THROUGH 
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. WITH INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES AND MODELS 
INDICATING 850 MB TEMPERATURES INCREASING TO AROUND 20-21C BY 
SUNDAY...SOME NEAR RECORD TO RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
POSSIBLE THIS WEEKEND /PARTICULARLY ACROSS NORTHEAST TN/SOUTHWEST VA 
WHERE THE RIDGE WILL BE CENTERED BY SUNDAY/. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
WARM TO THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S BY FRIDAY AND INTO THE LOW TO MID 
90S BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. AS THE CENTER OF THE HIGH MOVES OFF TO 
THE EAST ON MEMORIAL DAY...A GENERAL COOLING TREND WILL BEGIN 
HEADING INTO THE NEW WORK WEEK. SOME LATE AFTERNOON OROGRAPHICALLY 
INDUCED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE THIS 
WEEKEND...GIVEN SOME OF THE MOISTURE THAT WILL STILL BE PRESENT 
UNDERNEATH THE RIDGE. 

THE OTHER PLAYER IN THE WEATHER LATE THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK MAY BE A TROPICAL LOW THAT HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE GULF STREAM 
OFF OF THE COAST OF SOUTH CAROLINA/GEORGIA. THE LAST COUPLE OF RUNS 
OF THE NAM HAVE SHOWN THIS LOW DEEPENING AND APPROACHING THE 
GEORGIA COASTLINE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. THE PREVIOUS RUN OF 
THE GFS ALSO SUPPORTED THIS SOLUTION...BEFORE BACKING OFF IN ITS 
CURRENT RUN. SHOULD THIS OCCUR...ADDITIONAL MOISTURE WOULD BEGIN TO 
INFILTRATE THE REGION LATE THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...INCREASING THE POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS /PARTICULARLY 
ON A TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME WHEN A FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
PUSH THROUGH THE REGION/. FOR NOW...FEEL THAT AT LEAST LOW END 
CHANCE POPS IS WARRANTED FOR THIS TIME PERIOD...WITH THE HIGHEST 
VALUES FAVORING THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS.

.DISCUSSION...MINOR CHANGES WITH MORNING UPDATE. LOWERED 
TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINTS ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS. RAISED POPS 
ACROSS NE AREAS WHERE LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM  (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER LOW WILL SLOWLY LIFT 
NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE CAROLINAS TODAY.  ROTATION AROUND THIS LOW 
WILL CARRY IS ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION INTO THE MRX CWA 
DURING THE SHORT TERM.  MORNING ACTIVITY SHOULD BE SHOWERS AND 
REMAIN GENERALLY OVER NORTHERN AND EASTERN LOCATIONS.  AS THE AIR 
MASS BECOMES WEAKLY UNSTABLE DURING THE AFTERNOON...A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE AREA.  CLOUD COVER WILL HELP 
KEEP TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL FOR TODAY.  THE LOW WILL SLOWLY BEGIN 
TO PULL AWAY FROM THE REGION OVERNIGHT WITH ANY LINGERING CONVECTION 
ENDING FROM WEST TO EAST.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER LOW AND ASSOCIATED 
MOISTURE WILL BE LOCATED ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS THURSDAY 
KEEPING A CHANCE OF MAINLY AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS GOING 
FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. DRY ELSEWHERE.

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...UPPER RIDGING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS AND SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL PRODUCE A VERY 
WARM/HOT PERIOD OVER THE AREA WITH LIMITED CHANCES OF CONVECTION. 
HOWEVER...FORECAST SOUNDINGS DO SHOW ENOUGH MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY
TO KEEP CHANCES OF AFTERNOON/EVENING STORMS FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
BEGINNING SATURDAY AND CONTINUE THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. SOME OF 
THESE THUNDERSTORMS COULD MOVE INTO THE VALLEY DURING THE EARLY 
EVENING HOURS. MAIN STORY AGAIN WILL BE THE SUMMER-LIKE HEAT WITH 
HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S.

FOR TUESDAY...UPPER RIDGING WEAKENS ALLOWING A FRONT TO APPROACH THE 
AREA. DUE TO WEAKENING RIDGE...WILL INCLUDE CHANCE POPS AREA-WIDE.

NE FROM SRN GA. LIGHTNING STRIKES HAVE BEEN DIMINISHING SO LIMITED 
TO CB/VCTS FOR JUST CHA AND TRI FOR NOW. 

PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN LIGHT SO FAR FOR TAF SITES...SO 
CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS SHOULD INHIBIT DENSE FOG FROM DEVELOPING. 
CONVECTION WILL LIKELY DEVELOP AGAIN IN THE HEAT OF THE AFTERNOON 
ON WEDNESDAY...BUT IT SEEMS PREMATURE TO TRY TO PIN DOWN EXACTLY 
WHERE. THUS...I WENT FOR VFR CONDITIONS AND JUST VCSH. 

PREVIOUS AFD...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...
CONVECTION VERY SLOW TO MOVE THIS AFTERNOON AS WEAK TROUGH HANGS
OVER AREA. MUCH OF THE ENERGY FOR THE TROUGH HAS HEADED SOUTH WITH
VORT MAX/PSBL UPPER LOW THAT'S ABOUT TO CROSS INTO SW GA.
PERSISTENT RAINS OVER CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ARE MAINLY FROM DIURNAL
HEATING AND SHOULD DISSIPATE THIS EVENING. LIKEWISE MUCH OF THE
SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER THE AREA NOW WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE THIS
EVENING. BEST CHANCES OVERNIGHT WILL BE IN THE EAST AND NORTHEAST
WHERE UPPER LEVEL DIFLUENCE KEEPS SOME SLOW LIFT GOING THROUGH THE
NIGHT. KEEPING QPF VALUES FAIRLY LIGHT...CONSIDERING SOME OF THE
FLOW IS HAVING TO CROSS MOUNTAIN RIDGES TO GET INTO THE AREA.

FOR WEDNESDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS SHOULD BE EAST OF THE 
AREA...BUT A SPOKE OR TWO OF LIFT MAY SWEEP THROUGH THE NORTHEASTERN 
AREAS...MAKING FOR BETTER PRECIP CHANCES.

FOR TEMPS...WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE...BUT SLIGHTLY COOLER FOR MAX 
TEMPS WED IN NORTHEAST DUE TO THICKER CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERNS FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD CONTINUE TO BE 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WEDNESDAY EVENING INTO THURSDAY FROM A 
DEPARTING UPPER-LOW AND THE UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPERATURES EXPECTED 
FOR THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND.

AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE SLOW TO EXIT THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS REGION AS MODELS STILL ARE SHOWING IT CENTERED OVER 
WEST CENTRAL NORTH CAROLINA BY 00Z ON THURSDAY. THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PERSIST INTO THE EVENING 
HOURS WEDNESDAY AS SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE INFILTRATES THE EASTERN 
ZONES ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW. ON THURSDAY...PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES WILL BE LESSENED AS THIS STORM SYSTEM BEGINS TO TRACK INTO 
THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. HOWEVER...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LINGERING 
ACTIVITY ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES WILL EXIST DURING THE 
MORNING...ALONG WITH SOME OROGRAPHICALLY INDUCED CONVECTION ALONG 
THE MOUNTAINS DURING THE AFTERNOON.

IN THE WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM...A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS WEEKEND. WITH 
INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES AND 850 MB TEMPERATURES PROGGED TO WARM 
5-6C TO AROUND 20-21C BY SATURDAY/SUNDAY...SOME NEAR RECORD TO 
PERHAPS RECORD HIGHS WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. BY 
FRIDAY...HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S WILL BE COMMON ACROSS MOST OF THE 
AREA...AND THIS WEEKEND THE MERCURY COULD APPROACH THE MID 90S IN 
SOME LOCATIONS. BY MEMORIAL DAY...THE CENTER OF THE RIDGE WILL SHIFT 
EAST OF THE AREA...BUT WARM TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S TO AROUND 
90 DEGREES ARE STILL EXPECTED TO CLOSE OUT THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. SOME 
INCREASED PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND SOME COOLER TEMPERATURES MAY BE 
ON THE HORIZON HEADING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM 
SYSTEM BEGIN TO TRACK TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY.

WEST CENTRAL NORTH CAROLINA BY 00Z ON THURSDAY. THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL PERSIST INTO THE EVENING 
HOURS WEDNESDAY AS SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE INFILTRATES THE EASTERN 
ZONES ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW. ON THURSDAY...PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES WILL BE LESSENED AS THIS STORM SYSTEM BEGINS TO TRACK INTO 
THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. HOWEVER...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LINGERING 
ACTIVITY ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES WILL EXIST DURING THE 
MORNING...ALONG WITH SOME OROGRAPHICALLY INDUCED CONVECTION ALONG 
THE MOUNTAINS DURING THE AFTERNOON.

IN THE WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM...A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS WEEKEND. WITH 
INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES AND 850 MB TEMPERATURES PROGGED TO WARM 
5-6C TO AROUND 20-21C BY SATURDAY/SUNDAY...SOME NEAR RECORD TO 
PERHAPS RECORD HIGHS WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND. BY 
FRIDAY...HIGHS IN THE LOWER 90S WILL BE COMMON ACROSS MOST OF THE 
AREA...AND THIS WEEKEND THE MERCURY COULD APPROACH THE MID 90S IN 
SOME LOCATIONS. BY MEMORIAL DAY...THE CENTER OF THE RIDGE WILL SHIFT 
EAST OF THE AREA...BUT WARM TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 80S TO AROUND 
90 DEGREES ARE STILL EXPECTED TO CLOSE OUT THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND. SOME 
INCREASED PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND SOME COOLER TEMPERATURES MAY BE 
ON THE HORIZON HEADING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM 
SYSTEM BEGIN TO TRACK TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY.

.DISCUSSION...
WATER VAPOR IMAGERY SHOWS VERY STRONG VORT MAX IF NOT UPPER LOW
HEADED INTO CENTRAL AL...AND IS STILL DIGGING TO SE...THAT SEEMS TO
BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE ON WV LOOP. IF THIS FEATURE IS TAKING
/CONTROL/ THEN PREVIOUS MODELS HAD EVERYTHING FOCUSED TOO FAR
NORTH. HAVE RAISED POPS IN THE SOUTHERN AREAS TO LIKELY AS WELL AND
HAVE BUMPED UP THE QPF IN THAT AREA. FOR WEATHER GRID...HAVE
SHOWERS AS MAIN FEATURE THIS AFTERNOON WITH CHANCE OF THUNDER SOUTH
AND ISOLATED THUNDER NORTH.

ALTHOUGH WE ARE SURROUNDED BY FLOOD WATCHES IN OUR FAR NORTHERN
AREAS...NOT REALLY CONSIDERING FLOOD WATCH RIGHT NOW...PARTLY DUE
TO THE POSSIBILITY THAT THE FOCUS MAY BE FARTHER SOUTH...BUT ALSO
BECAUSE OUR AREAS DID NOT SEE THE HEAVY RAINS THAT THE SURROUNDING
AREAS DID...MOSTLY LESS THAN 0.10 INCH...EXCEPT FOR WESTERN LEE
COUNTY VA WHERE ISOLATED 1.5"+ AMOUNTS FELL YESTERDAY.

SURFACE FRONT HARD TO LOCATE IN PRESSURE FIELD...BUT LOOKING AT DEW
POINTS...IT STILL APPEARS TO BE NEAR PLATEAU. DUE TO PRESSURE
PATTERN WINDS WILL BE SWINGING AROUND ANYWAY...BUT DEW POINTS WILL
BE SLOW TO DROP THIS AFTERNOON AS WEAK FRONT WASHES THROUGH THE
AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED SHEAR 
AXIS ALONG WITH ELEVATED TERRAIN ON THE PLATEAU...LOOK TO BE 
ORGANIZING SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER WESTERN SECTIONS OF OUR AREA.  WE 
HAVE RECEIVED SOME PEA SIZE HAIL REPORTS ABOUT THESE STORMS.  

INDIVIDUAL THUNDERSTORM CELLS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO GET VERY
ORGANIZED AS SHEAR IS VERY WEAK...BUT THERE COULD BE BRIEF TIMES
WHERE THUNDERSTORMS GET STRONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE PEA SIZE HAIL AND
OUTFLOW WINDS TO 40 MPH. THESE INSTANCES WOULD LIKELY LAST ONLY 5-10 
MINUTES AS DOWNDRAFTS CHOKE OFF UPDRAFT AREA.  STEERING FLOW IS 
EXPECTED TO FURTHER WEAKEN THIS AFTERNOON...SO SHOWERS/STORMS MAY 
MOVE MORE SLOWLY LATER.

LOOKS LIKE UPPER TROUGH WILL BE OVER US FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF 
DAYS.  WILL BE NEEDING TO KEEP POPS IN FORECAST AREA WIDE FOR THESE 
TWO PERIODS.  WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE WASHING THROUGH THE AREA 
LATE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES
COOLER TUESDAY...BUT NOTHING DRAMATIC.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THE MAIN FORECAST
HIGHLIGHTS FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES
MIDWEEK FROM A DEPARTING UPPER-TROUGH/LOW AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES HEADING INTO MEMORIAL DAY WEEKEND.

MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH THAT WILL PROPAGATE 
THROUGH THE VOLUNTEER STATE ON TUESDAY GRADUALLY EVOLVING INTO A 
CLOSED LOW OVER EAST TENNESSEE/WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA AS IT SLOWLY 
MOVES OFF TO THE EAST TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. WITH ABUNDANT 
MOISTURE IN PLACE ACROSS THE AREA AND SOME ENHANCED LIFT ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE PASSAGE OF THIS STORM SYSTEM...A SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE OF 
STORMS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 00Z THURSDAY IS WARRANTED...
WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITIES FAVORING THE EASTERN AND
NORTHEASTERN ZONES /WHERE THE GREATER INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE WILL
BE LOCATED/. SOME ADDITIONAL CONVECTION MAY ALSO FAVOR THE
MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN...PARTICULARLY DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY.

RAIN CHANCES WILL WANE SIGNIFICANTLY BY WEDNESDAY EVENING/NIGHT AS 
THE UPPER-LOW EXITS THE REGION. THIS WILL ALLOW A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL 
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM TO PUSH INTO THE AREA LATE THIS WEEK AND BECOME 
THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH MEMORIAL DAY 
WEEKEND. AS A RESULT...MAINLY FAIR WEATHER IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE 
AREA ALONG WITH SOME UNSEASONABLY HOT CONDITIONS BY SATURDAY INTO 
SUNDAY AND THE CENTER OF THIS HIGH BECOMES SITUATED DIRECTLY OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MODELS ARE SHOWING 850 MB TEMPERATURES 
INCREASING TO AROUND 20-21C BY THIS TIME PERIOD. GIVEN THESE 
VALUES...THINK THAT MOS GUIDANCE IS DEFAULTING TOO MUCH TO CLIMO 
DURING AND HAVE RAISED TEMPS IN THE GRIDS BY A FEW DEGREES. THINK 
THAT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S SEEM REASONABLE FOR 
FRIDAY...AND THAT THEY SHOULD INCREASE TO THE LOW TO EVEN THE MID 
90S ACROSS SOME PORTIONS OF THE AREA BY THE WEEKEND. WITH SOME 
MOISTURE PRESENT UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME 
AFTERNOON OROGRAPHICALLY INDUCED CONVECTION ALONG THE MOUNTAINS WILL 
BE POSSIBLE...SO HAVE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALONG THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AFTER 18Z SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

NO REAL CHANGES TO PREVIOUS FORECAST. LOOKING LIKE PLATEAU WILL BE
FAVORED AREA OF THUNDERSTORM INITIATION. MID-UPPER WIND FIELD IS
VERY LIGHT SO MOVEMENT OF STORMS MAY BE SOMEWHAT ERRATIC. WILL NEED
TO WATCH FOR HEAVIER RAINS SITTING OVER AN AREA.  

ALSO...A WEAK NORTH-SOUTH ORIENTED SHEAR AXIS CAN BE SEEN ON WATER
VAPOR IMAGERY THAT IS SLOWLY MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. SEEMS LIKE IT
IS RESPONSIBLE FOR BAND OF SHOWERS IN WEST-CENTRAL THROUGH
SOUTHWEST PARTS OF REGION. BETWEEN THIS AXIS AND CONVECTION
DEVELOPING OVER PLATEAU...LOOKS LIKE CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS DOES
EXIST ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. WILL KEEP HIGHER POPS WEST.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
THE PERSISTENT SUMMER-LIKE PATTERN THAT HAS DOMINATED THE REGION FOR 
THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL FINALLY BEGIN TO CHANGE THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM. THE MID/UPPER RIDGE WILL GET PINCHED OFF BETWEEN THE COASTAL 
LOW AND AN APPROACHING TROUGH FROM THE WEST. FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS 
AND A WEAK PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AT THE SURFACE WILL BRING RISING 
PRECIP CHANCES THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW FROM WEST TO EAST...WITH 
LIKELY POPS IN THE PLATEAU BY THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER PRECIP AMOUNTS 
SHOULD BE LIGHT AS LIFT IS GENERALLY WEAK. INSTABILITY SHOULD BE 
SUFFICIENT FOR SOME ISOLATED SEVERE POTENTIAL...MAINLY IN SOUTHERN 
AREAS AND THE PLATEAU. INCREASING CLOUD COVER SHOULD LIMIT HIGH 
TEMPS TOMORROW TO THE UPPER 70S AND LOWER 80S IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UPPER TROUGH MOVES SE INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY. SURFACE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY SLIDES SE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON. CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE WIDESPREAD IN ADVANCE OF THE 
COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH. THIS ACTIVITY WILL BEGIN TAPERING OFF 
BY TUE AFTN. TEMPERATURES INSIDE OF CLIMO DUE TO CLOUD COVER. CUT 
OFF LOW TRIES TO DEVELOP JUST EAST OF THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN FROM THE 
SW. A GOOD WARMING TREND SETS UP INTO NEXT WEEKEND. ISOLATED AFTN 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE MOUNTAINS.

224 PM EDT SUN MAY 20 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
THE PERSISTENT SUMMER-LIKE PATTERN THAT HAS DOMINATED THE REGION FOR 
THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL FINALLY BEGIN TO CHANGE THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM. THE MID/UPPER RIDGE WILL GET PINCHED OFF BETWEEN THE COASTAL 
LOW AND AN APPROACHING TROUGH FROM THE WEST. FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS 
AND A WEAK PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AT THE SURFACE WILL BRING RISING 
PRECIP CHANCES THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW FROM WEST TO EAST...WITH 
LIKELY POPS IN THE PLATEAU BY THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER PRECIP AMOUNTS 
SHOULD BE LIGHT AS LIFT IS GENERALLY WEAK. INSTABILITY SHOULD BE 
SUFFICIENT FOR SOME ISOLATED SEVERE POTENTIAL...MAINLY IN SOUTHERN 
AREAS AND THE PLATEAU. INCREASING CLOUD COVER SHOULD LIMIT HIGH 
TEMPS TOMORROW TO THE UPPER 70S AND LOWER 80S IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UPPER TROUGH MOVES SE INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY. SURFACE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY SLIDES SE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON. CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO BE WIDESPREAD IN ADVANCE OF THE 
COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH. THIS ACTIVITY WILL BEGIN TAPERING OFF 
BY TUE AFTN. TEMPERATURES INSIDE OF CLIMO DUE TO CLOUD COVER. CUT 
OFF LOW TRIES TO DEVELOP JUST EAST OF THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY. THIS IS FOLLOWED BY AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN FROM THE 
SW. A GOOD WARMING TREND SETS UP INTO NEXT WEEKEND. ISOLATED AFTN 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE MOUNTAINS.

SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR HAS BEEN WORKING ITS WAY INTO NORTHERN PORTIONS
OF THE AREA...WITH DEWPOINTS AT TRI AND VJI IN THE UPPER 40S TO
LOWER 50S. FORECAST SOUNDINGS IN THIS AREA SHOW SOME CIN REMAINING
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...SO CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL LOOKS LOW THERE.
THE PLATEAU AND SOTUHERN AREAS WILL HAVE BETTER CHANCES OF SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS WHERE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS GREATER. WILL UPDATE
TO ADJUST POPS ACCORDINGLY. TEMPS LOOK ON TRACK FOR HIGHS SIMILAR
TO YESTERDAY...IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S IN MOST SPOTS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA WILL 
WEAKEN DURING THE PERIOD...BUT NOT MUCH CHANGE TO THE OVERALL
PATTERN FOR THE SHORT TERM SO FAIRLY PERSISTENT FORECAST.  WILL 
CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALL BUT SOUTHEAST CORNER OF THE AREA WHERE 
WILL CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS THIS AFTERNOON...WITH SLIGHT CHANCE INTO 
THIS EVENING ALL ZONES. MAV TEMPS HAVE BEEN VERY GOOD RECENTLY FOR 
HIGHS SO WILL FOLLOW CLOSELY FOR TODAY...BUT WILL GO ABOVE MOST MAV 
TEMPS A BIT FOR TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...H5 TROF MOVING THROUGH THE 
OHIO VALLEY MONDAY WILL BRING A CHANCE OF SHWRS AND TSTMS EARLY IN 
THE WORK WEEK. MODELS DIVERGE ON THE TIMING OF TROF EXIT...WITH 
ECMWF KEEPING A CUTOFF LOW OVER OUR REGION THROUGH WED NGT...THE GFS 
AND NAM ARE ABOUT A DAY EARLIER. EVEN SO...AFTER THE EARLY WEEK RAIN 
CHANCES...ALL MODELS BUILD IN STRONG HIGH PRESSURE FOR LATTER 
PORTION OF THE WEEK...AND TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL. AS STATED 
ALREADY...THE GFS IS QUICKEST WITH TROF EXIT AND RIDGE BUILDING. 
WILL FAVOR A SLOWER SOLUTION AND CUT BACK ON MOS TEMPS A TAD. EXPECT 
ISOLATED MOUNTAIN TSTMS WITH THE HEAT LATE WEEK...BUT OTHERWISE DRY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL REMAIN TO 
OUR WEST DURING THE SHORT TERM PERIOD...WITH WEAK UPPER LOW TO OUR 
EAST.  APPEARS THERE WILL BE SOME DRYER AIR WORKING IN TODAY WHICH 
SHOULD LEAD TO LESS CONVECTION THAN OCCURRED FRIDAY...ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SOUTHERN 
TWO THIRDS OF THE AREA FOR THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING.  MAV TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE FOR TODAY...BUT WILL TWEAK MOST MAV TEMPS 
UP SLIGHTLY FOR TONIGHT.   

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ATMOSPHERIC INSTABILITY AND 
MOISTURE IN THE VICINITY OF AN UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
U.S. COAST SHOULD BE JUST HIGH ENOUGH FOR THE PRODUCTION OF ISOLATED 
CONVECTION OVER THE MAJOR TERRAIN AREAS ON SUNDAY. MODELS INDICATE 
SOMEWHAT DEEPER MOISTURE AND SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY FOR ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED CONVECTION ON MONDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MAKES 
PROGRESS ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS FEATURE WILL DRIVE A 
SURFACE COLD FRONT TOWARD THE AREA LATER MONDAY WITH THE BOUNDARY 
PRESSING EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY. MODELS SEEM TO 
AGREE ON THIS SCENARIO WITH THE MORE ACTIVE WEATHER IN PLACE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THIS PERIOD SO ADJUSTED POPS INTO A 
MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE CATEGORY FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MODELS 
NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT ON STRENGTH AND POSITION OF A LINGERING 
UPPER TROUGH FOLLOWING THE ACTIVE EARLY WEEK PATTERN. BLENDING MODEL 
SOLUTIONS FOR WEDNESDAY ALLOWED FOR A CONTINUATION OF SLIGHT AND 
SMALL CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION ON THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
AS WELL AS CENTRAL EAST AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. BY THURSDAY UPPER 
LEVEL FEATURE SHOULD BE BUILDING FARTHER EAST BUT DUE TO UNCERTAINTY 
KEPT ISOLATED OROGRAPHIC SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS GOING IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION BY FRIDAY 
WHICH SHOULD SUPPRESS CONVECTION. STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO MEX MOS TEMP

WILL BE THE MAIN WX FEATURE THROUGH MONDAY. THE GFS SHOWS THE NEXT
H5 TROF KICKS OUT THE LOW...BUT THE OLD ECMWF AND DGEX SUGGEST THE

MUCH LIKE YESTERDAY...DIURNAL CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP
OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON. MODEL
FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW VIRTUALLY NO CIN THIS AFTERNOON...SO
OUTFLOW BOUNDAIRES THAT MOVE OFF THE TERRAIN MAY SPARK SOME SHOWERS
IN THE VALLEY. THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP ACROSS THE AREA LOOKS
REASONABLE AND WILL NOT NEED TO BE CHANGED. 1000-850 MB VALUES LOOK

MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. LOOKS LIKE THOSE HIGHER

MADE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS THIS EVENING TO THE POPS/WX AND TEMP
GRIDS...BUT OTHERWISE FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. SOME
ISOLATED STRONG THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO RUMBLE ACROSS THE
HIGHER TERRAIN OF NORTHEAST TN/SOUTHWEST VA FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF
HOURS...BEFORE WEAKENING WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. MADE
SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO THE ORIENTATION OF THE POP GRIDS TO ACCOUNT
FOR CURRENT AREAS OF STORM DEVELOPMENT...BUT AM EXPECTING THIS
ACTIVITY TO REMAIN FAIRLY ISOLATED ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES
THROUGH 03Z OR SO AND HAVE MAINTAINED THIS THINKING IN THE GRIDS.
LATER TONIGHT...MODELS ARE SHOWING THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LOCALIZED
FOG DEVELOPMENT AFTER 06-09Z THROUGH DAYBREAK. GIVEN THE HIGHER
BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE AND THE MOSTLY CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS
EXPECTED...THINK THAT THIS CERTAINLY SEEMS PLAUSIBLE IN OUR TYPICAL
SHELTERED/FOG-PRONE AREAS NEAR BODIES OF WATER...SO HAVE ADDED A
MENTION OF THIS TO THE FORECAST AFTER 06Z. OTHERWISE...A PLEASANT

THE COVERAGE OF CONVECTION A LITTLE. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND 
THIS COLD FRONT MAY CREATE ADDITIONAL CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY...WITH

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ALREADY SEEING A FEW STATIONS
REPORTING FOG...BUT NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH FOR AN ADVISORY. HIGH
PRESSURE BRINGING A DRY FORECAST FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. MODELS
INDICATING A TROUGH ENTERING THE REGION FROM THE NORTHWEST BUT
BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL THURSDAY. ABOVE
NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED AGAIN. MOS GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES
LOOKED REASONABLE SO STAYED CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND 
GENERALLY REVEAL A QUIET AND SUMMER-LIKE PATTERN. AN AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST WILL LINGER OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
DEVELOPING EACH AFTERNOON/EVENING ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THIS 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS SHOULD CREATE SOME SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION... 
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. A DEEP EASTERLY FLOW ON 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY SHOULD DRY OUT THE ATMOSPHERE ENOUGH TO PREVENT 
ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE WEEKEND. A MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW 
THEN DEVELOPS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON MONDAY...AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT FROM THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS ON MONDAY SHOULD AGAIN TRIGGER SOME OROGRAPHICALLY 
ENHANCED CONVECTION IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS COLD FRONT IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY...INCREASING THE 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE THE GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

A FEW ISOLATED STORMS ARE CONTINUING TO LINGER ACROSS FAR
NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE THIS EVENING...BUT AN OVERALL WEAKENING
TREND IS EXPECTED AND THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH WITHIN AN HOUR
OR SO WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. ONLY MADE SOME SMALL TWEAKS
TO THE TEMPERATURE GRIDS OVERNIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE MORE RAPID
COOLING OCCURRING THIS EVENING...BUT STILL HAVE LOWS BOTTOMING OUT
IN THE LOWER 50S IN THE NORTHEAST ZONES AND THE MID TO UPPER 50S
ELSEWHERE. GIVEN THE COMBINATION OF A PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLEAR
SKY...LIGHT WINDS AND MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS...FOG
DEVELOPMENT IS LIKELY ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT. DO NOT FEEL THAT
VISIBILITIES WILL DROP TOO LOW...BUT SOME LOCALIZED DENSE FOG MAY
IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT...PARTICULARLY IN FOG-PRONE
SHELTERED LOCATIONS OR AREAS NEAR BODIES OF WATER.

REBOUNDING NICELY TO AT OR ABOVE SEASONAL NORMS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...A WEAK SHORTWAVE 
TRACKS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE AREA ON THURSDAY. LIMITED MOISTURE WITH

SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A BROAD

MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. THUS... 
WILL MENTION A CHANCE FOR CONVECTION THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. 
CLOUDS SHOULD DECREASE LATER TONIGHT AS THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AXIS 
DRIFTS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS...WHICH SHOULD LEAD TO A GOOD SET UP 
FOR FOG DEVELOPMENT AFTER MIDNIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
AND WILL GENERALLY TREND CLOSE TO THE WARMER GFS MAXES AND WARMER 
NAM MINS WHICH HAVE BEEN VERIFYING BETTER LATELY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA 
BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY. A WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH 
THE AREA ON THURSDAY. GFS INDICATING MORE AVAILABLE MOISTURE THEN 
THE OTHER MODELS SO WILL CONTINUE A DRY FORECAST FOR THURSDAY. BUT 
ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY. THE BOUNDARY MOVES 
SOUTH OF THE REGION WITH STILL A CHANCE OF ISOLATED AFTERNOON 
THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE OVER THE MOUNTAINS WITH WEAK UPSLOPE  
CONDITIONS ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. AN UPPER TROUGH ENTERS THE REGION 
ON MONDAY INCREASING THE CHANCE OF MAINLY OROGRAPHIC ACTIVITY.

MILD AND MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE MAIN 
FORECAST PROBLEM FOR THIS TAF PERIOD WILL BE HOW MUCH FOG FORMS WITH

DRY ADVECTION EXPECTED. A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY WILL HELP TO GENERATE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUD COVER 
THIS MORNING...WHICH MAY KEEP THE FOG VISIBILITIES FROM FALLING TOO 
MUCH TOWARDS SUNRISE. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION SOME TEMPORARY IFR 
VISIBILITIES AROUND SUNRISE FOR KCHA AND KTYS...WHERE SOME BREAKS IN 
THE CLOUD COVER MAY DEVELOP LATER THIS MORNING. A MORE PERSISTENT

WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES SE THROUGH THE AREA EARLY THURSDAY WITH WEAK 
SURFACE REFLECTION. ISOLATED CONVECTION POSSIBLE BUT TOO LOW FOR 
MENTION AT THIS TIME. FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES SOUTH OF THE AREA AS

WEAK SURFACE LOW NEAR KCHA THIS MORNING WITH INVERTED TROUGH
EXTENDING TO THE NORTHEAST. BAND OF SHOWERS HAS BEEN CONTINUING
ALONG THIS TROUGH THIS MORNING...LOOKING LIKE IT IS FADING SOMEWHAT
NOW. THE LOW AND TROUGH ARE FORECAST TO DRIFT TO THE ENE THIS
AFTERNOON. AIR MASS LOOKS TO BE MARGINALLY UNSTABLE CONSIDERING
AFTERNOON FORECAST TEMPS...WITH MAX CAPE VALUES NEAR 1000 J/KG. SO
KEEPING POPS IN FORECAST...EVEN IN WAKE OF TROUGH...BUT WITH
TAPERING POPS TO THE WEST. WENT MOSTLY WITH SHOWERS...BUT HAVE
INCLUDED ISOLATED THUNDER AS WELL.


FOR TEMPS HAVE SHAVED OFF 1-2 DEGREES TO MAX TEMP
SELECTIVELY...FIGURING THAT LOW CONVECTIVE TEMPS WILL KEEP SURFACE
FROM HEATING UP TOO MUCH...HOWEVER...DOWNSLOPING POTENTIAL AT SOME

SOME CLOUD COVER AND SCATTERED SHOWERS LINGERING THROUGH THE NIGHT 
TIME HOURS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IN 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD REMAINS THE WANING PRECIPITATION CHANCES ACROSS 
THE REGION THROUGH THE MIDDLE PART OF THE WEEK FROM A SLOW DEPARTING 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH. BY TUESDAY MORNING...A SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL 
PROGRESS EAST OF THE AREA...RESULTING IN SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUD 
SHIELD AS SOME DRIER AIR ALOFT MOVES IN /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU REGION/. HOWEVER...WITH THE UPPER-TROUGH AXIS 
STILL PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA TOMORROW...THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS /GIVEN SOME SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
INSTABILITY VALUES/ WILL EXIST THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS....WITH THE 
BEST PRECIP CHANCES FAVORING THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CWA. GIVEN THE 
LIMITED AMOUNT OF CAPE AND THE LOW BULK SHEAR VALUES IN THE 
LOW-LEVELS...AM NOT EXPECTING ANY STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP TO BECOME 
TERRIBLY STRONG OR POSSESS MUCH ORGANIZATION. HOWEVER...SOME BRIEF 
BURSTS OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL FROM THE ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP 
WILL SLIGHTLY INCREASE THE STORM-TOTAL PRECIP AMOUNTS /WHICH SHOULD 
GENERALLY BE BETWEEN 1-2 INCHES/. 

THE TROUGH AXIS WILL SHIFT JUST EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. THIS WILL RESULT IN CLEARING SKIES AND MAINLY DRY 
CONDITIONS FOR THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK INTO 
THE WEEKEND AS UPPER-LEVEL RIDGING BEGINS TO NOSE INTO THE REGION. 
STILL...THERE WILL BE SOME MOISTURE PRESENT NEAR THE SURFACE WHICH 
WILL ALLOW FOR SOME ISOLATED OROGRAPHIC INDUCED CONVECTION TO OCCUR 
IN THE MOUNTAINS LATE THIS WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND. OTHERWISE...FAIR 
WEATHER AND A GRADUAL WARMING TREND IS EXPECTED...WITH THE MERCURY 
RETURNING TO THE LOW TO MID 80S IN MANY AREAS BY THE END OF THE WORK 
WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND
SURFACE FRONT/TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA...
ESPECIALLY TONIGHT AND MONDAY. KEPT POPS VERY HIGH OVERNIGHT AND
LIKELY WEST TO CATEGORICAL EAST ON MONDAY. THREAT OF THUNDERSTORMS
IS VERY MINIMAL...SO LIMITED TO MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. ACTUALLY
ALTHOUGH POPS DECLINE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...I SEE BETTER
CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS ON TUESDAY. THE SURFACE FRONT MOVES EAST
AND THERE MAY BE SOME BREAKS OF SUNSHINE...ALTHO UPPER TROUGH AXIS
IS STILL TO OUR WEST THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING. FORECAST SOUNDINGS
SHOW BEST INSTABILITY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...DUE IN PART
TO SOME MID LEVEL DRYING PLUS COOLER 500 MB TEMPS. FAVORED GFS MOS
POPS FOR TONIGHT AND A BLEND ON MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

OTHERWISE...TEMPS HAVE STRUGGLED TO WARM MUCH TODAY...BUT ALSO
WON'T FALL MUCH OVERNIGHT. TRENDED TOWARD THE COOLER NAM MOS HIGHS
MONDAY AND WENT VERY CLOSE TO BLEND FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...APPARENTLY A DRIER 
PERIOD IN STORE WITH UPPER TROUGH AXIS AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE/LIFT 
SHIFTS EAST OF THE TERRAIN PARKING OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN ATLANTIC 
COAST EARLY AND THEN GRADUALLY SHIFTING OUT OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC. WAS ABLE TO GO DRY WITH THE FORECAST THROUGHOUT MOST OF

SURFACE TROUGH AXIS OVER WRN MIDDLE TN INTO CENTRAL KY. FINALLY 
SEEING A GOOD COVERAGE OF MOSTLY LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST

VERY LITTLE POSITIVE CAPE. 12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW MUCH OF OUR

AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER CENTRAL MS...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED 
TROUGH EXTENDING NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS MIDDLE TN. THIS LOW IS PROGGED 
TO SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHEASTWARD TODAY...AND INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY 
TONIGHT. A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY IS 
PROGGED TO AMPLIFY SOME OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...WHICH WILL HELP TO GENERATE A FAIRLY EXTENSIVE AREA OF 
SHOWERS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY WITH THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. BOTH 
THE GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY DEVELOPING 
OVER SOUTHEAST TN THIS AFTERNOON...SO WILL MENTION A CHANCE FOR SOME 
THUNDER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IN 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE PRECIPITATION CHANCES EARLY THIS WEEK 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PASSING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE 
SOUTHEASTERN US. BY MONDAY MORNING...MODELS ARE ALL SHOWING 
WIDESPREAD APPRECIABLE QPF SIGNALS ACROSS MUCH OF FORECAST AREA AS 
LIFT/FORCING CONTINUES TO INCREASE WITH THE PASSING TROUGH. THIS 
SYSTEM WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE EASTWARD ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND GIVEN 
THE LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE CONTENT...AT LEAST A CHANCE OF SHOWERS WILL 
LINGER ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION THROUGH 00Z WEDNESDAY...WITH THE 
HEAVIEST RAINFALL CONTINUING TO FAVOR THE I-81 CORRIDOR OF NORTHEAST 
TN AND SOUTHWEST VA AND THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS.  

HAVE TWEAKED POPS SLIGHTLY...BUT HAVE MAINTAINED THE ORIENTATION OF 
THE MOST FAVORED AREAS BEING ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CWA. 
HAVE GONE LIKELY TO DEFINITE POPS IN THESE AREAS DURING THE DAY ON 
MONDAY...BEFORE SCALING BACK TO CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE MONDAY NIGHT. 
THEN AS THE SYSTEM GRADUALLY PULLS AWAY ON TUESDAY...HAVE TAPERED 
VALUES TO SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE WESTERN CWA TO LOW-END CHANCE IN THE 
EAST. THOUGH THERE MAY BE SOME LOCALLY HEAVIER AMOUNTS...PWAT VALUES 
ARE NOT OVERLY IMPRESSIVE FOR A WIDESPREAD VERY HEAVY RAIN/FLOODING 
EVENT FOR THE MONTH OF MAY...AND STILL GENERALLY THINK THAT STORM 
TOTAL RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE ON THE ORDER OF 1 TO 2 INCHES FOR 
MOST LOCATIONS.  

SOME LINGERING SHOWERS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT 
OTHERWISE RAIN CHANCES WILL DIMINSH SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE REMAINDER 
OF THE WEEK AS UPPER-LEVEL RIDGING BEGINS TO NOSE INTO THE AREA FROM 
THE EAST. THIS WILL LEAD TO CLEARING CONDITIONS AND A GRADUAL 
WARMING TREND EACH DAY DURING THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK AS 
THICKNESS VALUES AND 850/700 MB TEMPS INCREASE. HIGHS WILL RISE FROM 
THE LOW TO MID 70S ON MONDAY TO THE LOW TO MID 80S BY THURSDAY AND

.SHORT TERM...
AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFTING FROM OKLAHOMA INTO THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL BRING A GOOD CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD 
PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE REGION TODAY AND TONIGHT. CURRENT RADAR 
IMAGERY IS SHOWING A BAND OF HIGH BASED LIGHT SHOWERS PUSHING 
THROUGH NORTHERN ALABAMA INTO SOUTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE...WITH SOME 
SLIGHTLY HEAVIER RETURNS NOTED FURTHER TO THE SOUTH AND WEST. THIS 
ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED FASTER THAN MODELS WERE HINTING...THOUGH THE 
GFS SEEMS TO HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON THE TIMING/LOCATION OF THESE 
SHOWERS AT THE MOMENT. 

AFTER SUNRISE...AM EXPECTING SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS TO PUSH INTO 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND EVENTUALLY MUCH OF 
THE GREAT TENNESSEE VALLEY BY THE EARLY AFTERNOON. AS FORCING/LIFT 
BEGINS TO INCREASE WITH THE APPROACHING UPPER-TROUGH LATER IN THE 
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT...MODELS ALL SHOW SOLID QPF SIGNALS AND THE 
POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD SHOWER COVERAGE /ALONG WITH SOME ISOLATED 
STORMS/. GIVEN THIS THINKING...HAVE INCREASED POPS QUITE A BIT THIS 
AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT...WITH THE HIGHEST VALUES FAVORING THE 
WESTERN AND SOUTHWESTERN ZONES. WITH A FAIRLY DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER 
AOA 10 KFT AND PWATS PROGGED TO INCREASE TO BETWEEN 1.3-1.5 INCHES 
AFTER 00Z...CERTAINLY FEEL THAT LOCALLY HEAVY BURSTS OF RAINFALL 
WILL BE POSSIBLE /PARTICULARLY ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU REGION/. THESE VALUES...HOWEVER...DO NOT 
PARTICULARLY FAVOR A WIDESPREAD VERY HEAVY RAIN/FLOODING EVENT
ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE MONTH OF MAY. GIVEN THE ABUNDANT CLOUD
COVER AND SHOWER ACTIVITY...HIGHS WILL REMAIN ON THE COOL SIDE
TODAY IN THE LOWER TO MIDDLE 70S.

.LONG TERM...
(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
IN PULLING TEXAS UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SUNDAY AND MONDAY. DECENT JET STRUCTURE 
ENHANCING DIRECT CIRCULATION OVER THE AREA WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN 
FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING. THERE IS SOME DISAGREEMENT IN RESPECT TO THE 
LOCATION OF THE BEST FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING...BUT INVERTED SURFACE 
TROUGH WILL PROVIDE DECENT LIFT TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD RAIN/SHOWERS 
OVER THE AREA SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY. ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO WARRANT 
INCLUDING THUNDERSTORMS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AREA-WIDE. TOTAL 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 1 TO 2 INCHES ANTICIPATED MOST LOCATIONS.

FOR TUESDAY...UPPER TROUGH PULLS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS...BUT 
REMAINING INSTABILTY AND LOW LEVEL FORCING FROM OROGRAPHICS AND 
INVERTED TROUGH TO KEEP CHANCE OF SHOWERS GOING. BEST CHANCES OVER 
THE FAR EASTERN COUNTIES.

FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGING WILL BUILD 
INTO THE AREA WITH DRIER CONDITIONS AND A WARMING TREND...ESPECIALLY 
FOR DAYTIME HIGHS. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS CLOSELY THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED.

SHORT RANGE MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON TIMING THE DEVELOPMENT
OF SHOWERS...SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. SREF SPREADS LIGHT
QPF INTO SW VA TOWARD 13/00Z...BUT FOR NOW I KEPT POPS OUT OF SW VA
ON SATURDAY TO MESH BETTER WITH NWS NEIGHBORS (JKL/RLX/RNK). 

SHOWERS SPREAD ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT IN LINE WITH
FORECAST GRIDS...WITH PERHAPS ISOLATED TSRA POSSIBLE. HOWEVER...
BEST LIFT...INSTABILITY AND DEEPER MOISTURE IS SUNDAY...WHEN I
NUDGED POPS UP SLIGHTLY TO BE CLOSER TO GFS MOS POPS. ALSO...ADDED
A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. MOS TEMPS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT AND
GENERALLY FOLLOWED...ALTHO I DID FAVOR THE NAM MOS FOR HIGHS ON
SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...ALTHOUGH MODELS HAVE
GENERAL AGREEMENT OVERALL...THEIR QPF SOLUTIONS TEND TO DIVERGE
OVER OUR CWA. THE NAM/DGEX IS THE WETTEST WITH A CLOSED LOW STUCK
OVER MIDDLE AND EAST TN EARLY IN THE WORK WEEK. MEANWHILE THE GFS
AND ECMWF ARE MORE PROGRESSIVE WITH THIS WEEKEND/S WET WEATHER
SYSTEM SUCH THAT POPS/QPF ARE NOTABLY REDUCED ON TUESDAY...WITH A
MOSTLY DRY FCST FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK...XCPT MAYBE SOME
AFTERNOON/EVENING CONVECTION OVER THE MOUNTAINS LATE WEEK.
TEMPERATURES WILL RUN MOSTLY AROUND NORMAL TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY

WEATHER AND MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS AREAWIDE. WITH INCREASED
THICKNESS VALUES AND 850 MB TEMPERATURES PROGGED TO BE AROUND 4-5
DEGREES CELSIUS WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...DAYTIME HIGHS WILL BE 10-12
DEGREES WARMER IN THE MID 70S TO AROUND 80 DEGREES. AN UPPER-LEVEL
LOW WILL SLOWLY MOVE FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS OF WEST TEXAS INTO
THE RED RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...ALLOWING SOME HIGH CLOUDS TO BEGIN
TO OVERSPREAD THE AREA FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. SOME SHOWERS
AND STORMS WILL ALSO BEGIN TO WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AS WELL...BUT WILL REMAIN DISPLACED TO THE
SOUTHWEST OF THE AREA BEFORE MOVING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY ON
SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGING 
WILL MOVE EAST ALLOWING AN UPPER TROUGH OVER TEXAS TO MOVE SLOWLY 
EAST ALONG THE GULF COAST STATES SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. A 
NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS SOUTHERN 
CANADA/NORTHERN GREAT LAKES THIS WEEKEND WITH ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
PULLING SOUTH TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY BY LATE IN THE WEEKEND.

THESE FEATURES TOGETHER WILL PRODUCE UNSETTLED WEATHER WITH PERIODS 
OF SHOWERS ANTICIPATED FOR LATE FRIDAY SOUTHWEST FORECAST THEN 
SPREAD NORTHEAST SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. FOR MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY...FRONTAL BOUNDARY/INVERTED TROUGH WILL REMAIN OVER THE 
AREA. MODELS SHOW INCREASING INSTABILITY FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK AS MORE 
SUNSHINE ANTICIPATED...SO HAVE ADDED THUNDERSTORMS IN FOR MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY. SYSTEMS MOVE EAST OF THE AREA FOR MID-WEEK WITH DRIER AND

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A TRANQUIL PERIOD WITH
RIDGING THE MAIN FEATURE. MOISTURE STARTS TO INCREASE ON SATURDAY
AND COULD LEAD TO A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 
ECMWF WAS DRIER LIKE 12Z NAM...SO I KEPT SW VA AND NE TN AREAS DRY
FOR NOW. GFS MOS POPS MINUS 10 PERCENT OR SO MESHED WITH OUR NWS
NEIGHBORS GRIDS.

SOME LINGERING FAIR WEATHER CUMULUS CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY
EVENING SHOULD DISSIPATE...AS MORE MIXING OCCURS. THIS LEAVES
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES UNTIL PROBABLY AROUND 06Z SATURDAY. 850 MB TEMPS
DON'T SUGGEST ANY COOLER THAN UPPER 30S IN A FEW SPOTS TONIGHT. MOS
TEMPS WERE QUITE CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED FOR EACH PERIOD.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THIS PERIOD APPEARS 
TO BE SOMEWHAT ACTIVE WITH MEAN TROUGHING OVER THE EASTERN STATES. 
MODELS HAD SOME DIFFERENCES BUT STAYED WITH A BLEND OF THE EUROPEAN 
AND GFS MEANS WHICH BASICALLY BRING A SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH 
TOWARD THE REGION DURING THE WEEKEND SO HAVE LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS SATURDAY NIGHT AS MOISTURE IS INCREASING AHEAD OF THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TROUGH. INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH BUILDS ACROSS THE 
DEEP SOUTH ABOUT SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY WITH INCREASING LIFT AS WELL 
AS INSTABILITY. CRANKED UP POPS FOR DAYTIME CONVECTION AND NIGHTTIME 
SHOWERS INTO THE GOOD CHANCE TO LIKELY RANGE FOR THE SLOW PUSH EAST. 
DURING THE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY TIMEFRAME...MODELS DEPICT A FINAL 
PIECE OF ENERGY DROPPING THROUGH THE BASE OF THE NORTHERN STREAM 
MEAN TROUGH SO JUST KEPT CONVECTIVE POPS IN A LOWER SLIGHT AND 
CHANCE REALM FOR THIS PERIOD. UPPER TROUGH MAY BE EAST OF THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY THURSDAY WITH DRY ADVECTION AND BUILDING 
HEIGHTS. THEREFORE WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE FINAL DAY OF THE EXTENDED

.SHORT TERM...
A FEW AREAS OF LIGHT SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO SHIFT INTO THE 
CAROLINAS AND CENTRAL VIRGINIA OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS...AND
SHOULD CLEAR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA BY THE LATE AFTERNOON AS AN
UPPER-TROUGH SHIFTS EAST OF THE REGION. CLOUD COVER HAS ALSO BEGUN
TO BREAK UP ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS DRIER AIR PUNCHES IN
BEHIND THIS SYSTEM FROM THE NORTHWEST. THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE
OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENING...WITH ONLY HIGH CLOUDS AND MOSTLY
CLEAR CONDITIONS OCCURRING IN MOST LOCATIONS BY 00Z OR SO. THE
COMBINATION OF LIGHT WINDS AND MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS IN
AREAS THAT RECEIVED MEANINGFUL RAINFALL MAY RESULT IN SOME
LOCALIZED LIGHT FOG DEVELOPMENT IN SOME SHELTERED AREAS.
HOWEVER...WITH DRIER AIR WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE REGION...DO NOT
FEEL ANY WIDESPREAD FOG DEVELOPMENT IS LIKELY. WITH A COOLER POST
FRONTAL AIRMASS IN PLACE ACROSS THE AREA...TEMPERATURES OVERNIGHT
WILL BE NOTABLY COOLER IN MANY SPOTS. IN FACT...THESE WILL BE THE
COOLEST READINGS THIS MONTH BY ABOUT 10-15 DEGREES...AS THE MERCURY
WILL FALL INTO THE UPPER 40S TO AROUND 50 DEGREES ACROSS MUCH OF
THE FORECAST AREA. MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND FAIR WEATHER IS
EXPECTED ON THURSDAY...BUT NORTHERLY FLOW WILL HELP TO KEEP THE
COOL AIR IN PLACE AND HIGHS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S AREAWIDE.

.LONG TERM...
FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS NOT TOO HIGH AS MAIN FEATURE 
WILL BE THE TIMING OF THE APPROACH OF CLOSED LOW FROM THE DESERT 
SOUTHWEST. MODEL DIFFERENCES OVER WHEN IT OPENS AND COMES THROUGH...
AND WHETHER IT IS REPLACED BY A NEW CLOSED LOW THANKS TO ENERGY 
DROPPING DOWN FROM THE NORTH...ARE ALL UNDERSTANDABLE GIVEN THE 
NATURE OF SUCH FEATURES. MOST OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST PERIOD WILL 
CONTAIN CLOUDS AND SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS. FORTUNATELY...NEW
ECMWF RUN IS CONSISTENTLY DRIER THAN THE GFS/NAM...SO MY 
UNDERCUTTING OF MEX MOS GUIDANCE COULD PAN OUT WELL.

TROUGH SHIFTS EAST OF THE AREA. GIVEN THE RECENT TRENDS AND LACK OF
INSTABILITY TO WORK WITH...HAVE OPTED TO REMOVE A MENTION OF
THUNDER IN THE FORECAST. THE MOST FAVORED AREAS FOR POPS WILL BE
ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN ZONES...NORTHEAST TN AND SW VIRGINIA
FROM THE LATE MORNING THROUGH THE MID AFTERNOON. MORE SCATTERED TO
EVENTUALLY ISOLATED ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU INTO THE WESTERN GREAT TENNESSEE VALLEY AFTER 16-17Z OR SO.
BY 00Z PRECIP CHANCES WILL WANE SIGNIFICANTLY AREAWIDE AS A DRIER
AND COOLER AIRMASS IS PUSHED INTO THE REGION IN WAKE OF THIS
SYSTEM. ALSO...GIVEN THE SHOWERS AND PERSISTENT CLOUD
COVER...NOTABLY COOLER HIGHS TEMPS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S
ARE ANTICIPATED FOR THIS AFTERNOON...SO HAVE ADJUSTED TEMPS
ACCORDINGLY BY A DEGREE OR TWO TO REFLECT THIS.

ARE ONCE AGAIN MILD IN THE UPPER 50S TO UPPER 60S. WITH WINDS
INCREASING FROM THE NORTHWEST AND CLOUDS MUCH OF THE MORNING AND
AFTERNOON EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO RISE 5 TO 10 DEGREES TO MID 60S TO

.SHORT TERM...
A DEPARTING UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE AND AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT 
FRONT FROM THE NORTHWEST WILL RESULT IN INCREASED RAIN CHANCES AND 
SOME COOLER CONDITIONS FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ACROSS A VERY 
MOIST AIRMASS THE AFTERNOON. A BULK OF THE ACTIVITY IS ACROSS FAR 
NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IN RESPONSE TO A 
DEPARTING SHORTWAVE TROUGH EXITING TO THE NORTHEAST. 
HOWEVER...ADDITIONAL NEW DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON HAS BEEN 
TRIGGERED BY A PREFRONTAL TROUGH THAT HAS NOW WORKED ITS WAY INTO 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. NOT TOO FAR BEHIND IT...A COLD FRONT HAS 
BEGUN TO WORK ITS WAY INTO TO MIDDLE TENNESSEE FROM THE NORTHWEST. 
IT IS THIS FRONT AND THE ASSOCIATED JET DYNAMICS FROM ITS PARENT 
UPPER-TROUGH THAT WILL BE THE SOURCE FOR OUR PRECIPITATION CHANCES 
OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. 

BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING...THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT 
WILL HAVE BEGUN TO MOVE THROUGH THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND INTO THE 
GREAT TENNESSEE VALLEY. GIVEN THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER AND SOME 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER INSTABILITY PARAMETERS...SOME SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP INITIALLY...BEFORE BECOMING 
PREDOMINANTLY RAIN SHOWERS AS THE FRONT PUSHES FURTHER EAST INTO THE 
SMOKIES AND A MORE STABLE AIRMASS BY THE LATE EVENING. OVERNIGHT 
INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY...MODELS ARE SHOWING A GOOD POTENTIAL FOR 
SHOWERS DEVELOPING ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS FROM GEORGIA 
INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. HOWEVER...LATER IN THE DAY THERE IS SOME  
DISCREPANCY REGARDING THE TIMING AND DURATION OF THE PRECIPITATION. 
THE NAM IS SHOVING MOST OF THE APPRECIABLE QPF SIGNALS EAST OF THE 
AREA BY LATE MORNING...WHILE THE GFS HANGS UP THE FRONT A LITTLE 
FURTHER NORTH AND IS INDICATING A GREATER AMOUNT OF ENHANCED LIFT 
FROM THE PASSING UPPER TROUGH...WHICH COULD GENERATE ADDITIONAL 
SHOWERS /MAINLY ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAIN ZONES AND SW VIRGINIA/ 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. GIVEN THIS POSSIBILITY...HAVE INCREASED POPS 
TO LIKELY ACROSS PORTIONS OF THIS AREA LATE TONIGHT THROUGH MIDDAY 
TOMORROW...AS OROGRAPHIC LIFT SHOULD ALLOW SOME ACTIVITY TO PERSIST 
WELL INTO THE DAY TOMORROW...BUT DO CONTINUE TO SHOW THINGS SOLIDLY 
TAPERING OFF FROM WEST TO EAST BY THE AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION TO THE 
RAINFALL CHANCES...THE TREND OF COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE AS 
HIGHS WILL REACH THE MID TO UPPER 70S TOMORROW AND DROP BACK INTO 
THE UPPER 40S AND LOWER 50S TOMORROW NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS 
FORECAST PERIOD...THE AREA WILL BE IN AN UPPER LEVEL NW FLOW WITH 
AN EXITING TROF TO OUR EAST AND AN UPPER RIDGE OVER THE ROCKIES.  A 
PROGRESSIVE SETTING SHOWS THE UPPER RIDGE MOVING INTO THE REGION 
DURING FRIDAY AND INTO SATURDAY...THEN A COUPLE OF SHORTWAVE TROFS 
MOVE INTO THE REGION SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE...THURSDAY WILL HAVE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE 
REGION.  BY SATURDAY...A RETURN FLOW BEGINS AND BY SUNDAY AND INTO 
MONDAY AN INVERTED TROF WILL BE EDGING CLOSER TO THE AREA. DURING 
THIS UNSETTLED TIME...THE LATER PERIODS...NO MAJOR UPPER LEVEL LIFT 
IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE AREA...BUT LOWER TO MID LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT 
LOOKS LIKE IT WOULD BE WIDESPREAD IN ADVANCE OF THE INVERTED TROUGH.

IN GENERAL...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH PLACEMENT OF MAJOR 
FEATURES WITH THIS SYSTEM NEXT WEEK...AND MOST ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE 
IN THE BALLPARK WITH THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM.  THIS SYSTEM LOOKS 
FAIRLY WET...SO WILL BUMP UP POPS IN THE LATER PERIODS SLIGHTLY 
ABOVE GUIDANCE.

INSTABILITY OVERALL NEXT WEEK...LOOKS ONLY MARGINAL WITH THE 
INVERTED TROUGH...SO NOT EXPECTING SEVERE STORMS AT THIS POINT.

HAVE MADE SOME SLIGHT CHANGES TO AFTERNOON POPS/WX AND TEMPS...BUT
GENERALLY THE FORECAST IS ON TRACK. THIS MORNING...SOME SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED STORMS ASSOCIATED WITH A DEPARTING UPPER
SHORTWAVE TROUGH ARE CONTINUING TO PUSH ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN
ZONES. THIS ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO WANE THROUGHOUT THE DAY...BUT
SOME ISOLATED ACTIVITY SHOULD PERSIST ACROSS THIS AREA THROUGHOUT
THE AFTERNOON. A COLD FRONT PRESENTLY LOCATED ACROSS WESTERN TN/KY
WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK TOWARD THE AREA OVER THE COURSE OF THE
DAY...INCREASING CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING FROM WEST TO EAST. THE ONE INHIBITING FACTOR MAY BE SOME
BKN/OVC DECKS OF LOW CLOUD COVER THAT WILL MAY PERSIST ACROSS MUCH
OF EAST TN THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY. HOWEVER...SOME BREAKS IN THE
CLOUDS HAVE BEEN NOTED ON VISIBLE SATELLITE IMAGERY ACROSS MIDDLE
AND SOUTHEASTERN TN ALREADY. WITH SOME APPRECIABLE INSTABILITY
PROGGED TO BE IN PLACE BY THIS AFTERNOON AND THE FRONT AND
PREFRONTAL TROUGH APPROACHING...CERTAINLY FEEL THAT A CHANCE OF
STORMS IS WARRANTED ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA BY THIS
AFTERNOON AND HAVE ADJUSTED THE GRIDS ACCORDINGLY. WITH SLIGHTLY
LESS CLOUD COVER AND SW FLOW...TEMPS MAY ALSO CREEP UP INTO THE
LOWER 80S AT KCHA AND SURROUNDING AREAS ACROSS SE TENNESSEE...SO
HAVE BUMPED VALUES UP A FEW DEGREES THERE.

.AVIATION...FLIGHT CONDITIONS NOT TOO BAD AT THE MOMENT ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND THIS SHOULD CONTINUE FOR A FEW MORE
HOURS. HOWEVER...A FLUX OF DEEP MOISTURE WILL BE IN PLACE AS A
SHORT WAVE TROUGH BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION LATER TONIGHT FOLLOWED
BY A SURFACE COOL FRONT ON TUESDAY. BELIEVE FLIGHT WEATHER WILL
DETERIORATE AS SCATTERED SHOWERS DEVELOP TONIGHT. BASICALLY HAVE
TRI AND CHA BECOMING MVFR WHILE TYS HOVERS JUST ABOVE MARGINAL
FLIGHT CONDITIONS UNTIL EARLY TUESDAY MORNING WHEN SATURATED
CONDITIONS WILL LIKELY LEAD TO LOWER VSBY IN FOG. THE COOL FRONT
MAKES PROGRESS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH DURING THE DAY BRINGING AN END
TO THE RAIN FROM WEST TO EAST ALONG WITH ASSOCIATED IMPROVING
FLYING WEATHER.

315 PM EDT MON MAY 7 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...WEAKENING RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE ALOFT OVER THE AREA WILL CONTINUE TO FLATTEN AND MOVE TO THE
EAST COAST IN RESPONSE TO PRIMARY SHORTWAVE THAT WILL MOVE INTO
GREAT LAKES...AND SECONDARY SHORTWAVE THAT WILL MOVE EASTWARD
/BETWEEN THE EAST COAST RIDGE AND GREAT LAKES TROF/ THROUGH THE OHIO
VALLEY AND INTO THE APPALACHIANS OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THIS SECONDARY
SHORTWAVE WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH A SURFACE COLD FRONT...THUS
FORECAST CALLS FOR SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY AS THE SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH. 

TENDED TO FAVOR PREVIOUS FORECAST MAX TEMPS FOR TUESDAY...CLOSER
TO MET MOS...THUS UNDERCUTTING MAV MOS A LITTLE. 

MCC REFIRING OVER MS MAY BE AN INHIBITING FACTOR TO HIGH MODEL
POPS OVER OUR CWA...SPC HAS CUT OUT THE SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE FOR
OUR AREA DUE TO THIS FEATURE. MY POPS TONIGHT ARE CLOSER TO MET MOS
THAN TO THE MAV...TUESDAY POPS SOMEWHAT OF A BLEND OF THE TWO MOS
VALUES WITH NEAR 70 PERCENT AREA WIDE WITH FROPA.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS ARE SHOWING BIG DIFFERENCES WITH THE TIMING OF EXITING PRECIP 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THE GENERAL PATTERN OF THE MODELS SEEMS 
TO INDICATE THAT THE SURFACE FRONT WILL HANG UP NEAR THE MOUNTAINS 
THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT BEFORE A DEEP UPPER TROUGH IS ABLE TO PUSH IT 
EASTWARD LATE WEDNESDAY. GFS KEEPS PRECIP EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS 
TUESDAY NIGHT...WHILE THE CANADIAN HANGS ON TO PRECIP OVER US 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING...WITH THE NAM BEING A COMPROMISE 
SOLUTION. WILL FOLLOW THE TREND OF RECENT GFS/NAM RUNS AND TAPER OFF 
POPS A BIT FASTER THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST...BUT STILL KEEP A CHANCE 
POP IN FAR EASTERN ZONES THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 

A MUCH COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS BUILDS INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT/THURSDAY AS A CLOSED LOW TRACKS ACROSS NEW ENGLAND. HIGHS 
THURSDAY WILL BE IN THE MID 60S TO MID 70S RANGE UNDER SUNNY SKIES. 
A WARMING TREND FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WILL BRING TEMPS BACK UP TO NEAR 
NORMAL. 

THE GFS HAS BEEN SHOWING A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH BRINGING 
PRECIP INTO OUR AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...THEN MERGING WITH A 
DEEP NORTHERN STREAM LONGWAVE TROUGH ON SUNDAY NIGHT. THE CANADIAN 
AND ECMWF ARE QUITE DIFFERENT...AND THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SPREAD IN 
THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW. WILL KEEP THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.

MOISTURE THROUGH THE PERIOD. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES CONTINUE AND 
WEAK WARM FRONT MOVES NORTH UP THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. ISOLATED TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA WILL BEGIN TO BREAK DOWN DURING THE
PERIOD. WILL CARRY LOW POPS INTO TONIGHT FOR SOME ISOLATED TO
WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION MAINLY THIS EVENING...ALTHOUGH MAY BE
SOME CONVECTION MAINLY SOUTH LATER TONIGHT. WILL ALSO INCLUDE SOME
PATCHY FOG FOR LATE TONIGHT. LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE MORE
AVAILABLE MOISTURE MONDAY...SO PLAN CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES. MAV
TEMPS LOOK GOOD AGAIN SO WILL STAY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL RETREAT EASTWARD 
MONDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING FOR INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION AHEAD OF A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. THE NAM AND SREF HAVE 
SLOWED DOWN THE PRECIP JUST A LITTLE FROM PREVIOUS RUNS...WITH 
PRECIP ENTERING THE PLATEAU LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND THE BEST CHANCES 
AREA-WIDE BEING TUESDAY. WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS GOING THROUGH THE DAY 
TUESDAY. SEVERE POTENTIAL LOOKS LOW TUESDAY GIVEN THE WEAK 
AMPLIFICATION OF THE TROUGH. THE SURFACE FRONT LAGS THE UPPER TROUGH 
PASSAGE...SO WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. 
UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH REGARDING FRONTAL TIMING...WITH THE NAM AND GFS 
SHOWING ABOUT A 12 HOUR DIFFERENCE WITH THE FROPA. WILL GRADUALLY 
LOWER POPS DOWN TO A SLIGHT CHANCE BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.

DRIER AND COOLER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS 
A DEEP CLOSED LOW OVER NEW ENGLAND PROVIDES A NORTHERLY FLOW ALOFT. 
A BUILDING RIDGE WILL BRING TEMPS BACK TO NORMAL BY SATURDAY. GFS 
AND ECMWF SHOW THE RIDGE WEAKENING AND A BROAD TROUGH DEVELOPING 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AN OHIO VALLEY ON SUNDAY...AND WILL CARRY A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP SUNDAY WITH THIS SYSTEM.

OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A RELATIVELY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA (COMPARED TO THE REST OF THE TN RIVER VALLEY) DUE TO 
THE EARLIER CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY FROM THIS MORNING. THIS DRIER AIR

FLOW MEANS A LITTLE COOLER TEMPERATURES TONIGHT AND THERE COULD BE
A BIT OF MVFR FOG AROUND TYS. COOLING TEMPS AROUND TRI WITH SOME

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY TRAVERSING NORTHERN SECTIONS THIS AFTERNOON
WILL EXIT THIS EVENING. WILL HAVE 20 POPS ALL ZONES BEFORE
MIDNIGHT...THEN DRY WITH PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING. MODELS SHOWING SOME
DRYING FOR TOMORROW...AND APPEARS IT WILL BE TOO CAPPED FOR
CONVECTION EXCEPT POSSIBLY OVER SOUTHERN AREAS AND EASTERN
MOUNTAINS. WILL JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE AFTERNOON POPS THOSE AREAS
IN THE AFTERNOON. VERY WARM CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE...AND WILL NOT
STRAY FAR FROM REASONABLE LOOKING MAV NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE FROM THE SURFACE THROUGH THE MIDLEVEL WILL BE 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND CAROLINAS THROUGH MONDAY 
MORNING. A SE FETCH OFF THE ATLANTIC COULD BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
A SHOWER TO SOUTHERN SECTIONS SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING. THE 
RIDGE BEGINS TO GIVE WAY MONDAY AFTERNOON...AND A SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. CHANCE POPS IN THE AFTERNOON RISE 
TO LIKELY IN WESTERN SECTIONS BY MIDNIGHT. WITH OVERNIGHT PASSAGE OF 
THE SHORTWAVE AND GENERALLY WEAK FORCING...SEVERE POTENTIAL LOOKS 
LOW...AND WILL HAVE JUST A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE LIKELY
SHOWERS. THE NAM BEGINS TO CLEAR OUT PRECIP THROUGH THE DAY
TUESDAY...WHILE THE GFS HANGS ON TO PRECIP INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. THE
SURFACE FRONT TRAILS THE MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE IN BOTH MODELS...SO
WILL KEEP A LOW CHANCE POP INTO TUESDAY NIGHT.

WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY LOOK DRY WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND AS A 
RIDGE BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED ACROSS THE MS VALLEY REGION. A COOLER 
AIRMASS IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT WILL GIVE TEMPS SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL

NORTHERLY TONIGHT. SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY WILL SAG SOUTH INTO NE TN TODAY AND DOWN INTO THE 
SMOKIES TONIGHT. BROKEN LINE OF CONVECTION CURRENTLY WEAKENING 
ACROSS KENTUCKY WILL SEND OUTFLOW BOUNDARY INTO NORTHERN PARTS OF

WITH DIFFERENTIAL HEATING AND CONVERGENCE ALONG THE BOUNDARY SHOULD 
BE ENOUGH FOR CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT TODAY. MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES 
CONTINUE TO BE MARGINAL BUT UPDRAFTS SHOULD BE ABLE TO OVERCOME 700

BUT THEY ARE NOT EXPECTED TO CLEAR AREA. THIS KEEPS PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES GOING OVERNIGHT. SOUTHERN AREAS MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED 
SOME FOR TONIGHT WITH LATER UPDATES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...A COMPLEX OF
STORMS MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN INDIANA WILL MOVE EAST-SOUTHEAST TOWARD
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHERN TENNESSEE. THIS AREA IS ASSOCIATED
WITH A MCV FROM LAST NIGHTS CONVECTION. THE LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS
WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BETWEEN 23Z-01Z THIS EVENING.
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM THIS CONVECTION WILL LIKELY PRODUCE
ADDITIONAL STORMS OVER THE AREA TONIGHT WITH THE BEST COVERAGE
ALONG AND NORTH OF INTERSTATE 40. DECENT INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THIS
LINE WITH THERMODYNAMICS SUPPORTIVE OF DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS.
ISOLATED HAIL THREAT AS WELL.

FOR SATURDAY...PLENTY OF LEFT-OVER BOUNDARIES AND APPROACHING FRONT
WILL REMAIN SUPPORTIVE OF SCATTERED CONVECTION. WENT FOR CHANCE
POPS AREA-WIDE...BUT MAY NEED TO UP POPS LATER DEPENDING ON
EVOLUTION OF OVERNIGHT SYSTEM. FRONT WILL DRAG SOUTH OF THE AREA
SATURDAY EVENING ENDING CHANCES OF STORMS. AREAS OF FOG ARE
ANTICIPATED SUNDAY MORNING DUE TO THE RECENT RAINS...LIGHT
WINDS...AND PLENTY OF BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS.

FOLLOWED GFS MOS CLOSELY THROUGHT THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A FAIRLY ACTIVE PATTERN IS
ANTICIPATED IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD... WITH SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES
FOR PRECIPITATION ACROSS EASTERN TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
DURING THE UPCOMING WEEK. IN THE WAKE OF A POTENTIAL PASSING SQUALL
LINE/MCS ON SATURDAY NIGHT...MODELS ARE SHOWING SOME ADDITIONAL
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA ON SUNDAY /WITH
THE BETTER CHANCES FAVORING THE HIGHER TERRAIN/. THE MAIN WEATHER
FEATURE THAT WILL IMPACT THE AREA WILL BE A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM PROGGED TO MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD FROM THE NORTHERN
PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO RIVER VALLEY. A COLD FRONT
THAT HAS BEEN HUNG UP WELL TO THE NORTH OF THE OHIO RIVER WILL BE
FORCED SOUTHWARD TOWARD THE REGION MONDAY INTO TUESDAY AND WILL
SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION EARLY NEXT WEEK.

IN WAKE OF THE FROPA MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...MODELS ARE STILL IN 
A LITTLE BIT OF DISAGREEMENT WITH WITH THE EXACT MOVEMENT AND 
POSITION OF THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER-LOW. THE GFS HAS BEEN FAR MORE 
PROGRESSIVE WITH THIS SYSTEM...PUSHING IT TO THE NORTHEAST INTO THE 
ST LAWRENCE RIVER VALLEY WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. THE ECMWF HAD BEEN 
TRENDING SLOWER...WITH THE 00Z RUN SHOWING MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK AND 
A CUT-OFF LOW DEVELOPING OVER KENTUCKY/TENNESSEE DURING THIS SAME 
TIME PERIOD. IT SHOULD BE NOTED THAT THE 12Z RUN HAS TRENDED MUCH MORE 
TOWARD THE GFS SOLUTION...WHICH WOULD CERTAINLY TAPER OFF RAIN 
CHANCES FOR THE REGION BY MID-WEEK. HOWEVER...GIVEN SOME UNCERTAINTY 
IN THE TRACK...OPTED TO PLACE LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS /MAINLY IN 
THE FAR NORTHEASTERN ZONES/ WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. DRIER 
CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED TOWARD THE END OF THE WORK WEEK AS AN 
UPPER-RIDGE WILL SHIFT BEGIN TO SHIFT OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN US BY

.SHORT TERM...
AN UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE WILL CONTINUE TRACKING ACROSS CENTRAL
TENNESSEE THE AFTERNOON...BRINGING INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. AS OF 19Z...AN AREA OF
SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM HAS BEGUN TO PUSH INTO
NORTHEASTERN ALABAMA AND THE EXTREME SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE
CWA. ADDITIONALLY...WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES ALOFT AND A WEAKER CAP
IN SOME AREAS...SOME SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEGUN TO DEVELOP
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE
MOUNTAINS OF EXTREME NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE. OVER THE COURSE OF THE
EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS...THE AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH IS EXPECTED
TO SHIFT NORTHEASTWARD AND SWING ACROSS THE SPINE OF THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS.

MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW SHOWERS AND STORMS GRADUALLY OVERSPREADING
THE AREA FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST OVER THE COURSE OF THE EVENING
HOURS. ADDITIONALLY...ANOTHER PLUME OF LOW TO MID LEVEL MOISTURE
IS PROGGED TO SURGE NORTHWARD FROM GEORGIA TOWARD THE SMOKY
MOUNTAINS LATE TONIGHT...POTENTIALLY INITIATING MORE SCATTERED
SHOWERS INTO THE EARLY MORNING HOURS TOMORROW. GIVEN THIS
POTENTIAL...HAVE TWEAKED POPS OVERNIGHT TO FAVOR THE EASTERN
MOUNTAINS...THOUGH A SOLID CHANCE IS EXPECTED AREAWIDE...BEFORE
TAPERING THEM OFF AFTER 12Z TOMORROW.

WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED DISTURBANCE WEAKENING AND SHIFTING EAST OF
THE AREA...A LARGE SUBTROPICAL HIGH LOCATED ACROSS THE RIO GRANDE
VALLEY WILL GRADUALLY BEGIN TO NOSE INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL
INDUCE A NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND POTENTIALLY ALLOW SOME SCATTERED
STORMS THAT WILL DEVELOP ACROSS OHIO VALLEY TO DRIFT TOWARD THE
NORTHERN ZONES LATE IN THE DAY IN ADDITION TO ANY TERRAIN IN
INCUDED STORMS THAT DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM...FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...

MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THIS WEEKEND WITH UPPER RIDGE WEAKENING 
OVER THE OHIO AND TN VALLEYS WITH STRONGEST PART TO THE SOUTH AND 
WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA...OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS STATES. SHORT 
RANGE ENSEMBLE MODELS BRING WEAK SHORT WAVE ACTIVITY MAINLY ACROSS 
THE NE HALF OF THE REGION OVERNIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT THEN SLOWLY MOVING 
SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY. RIDGE STRENGTHENS TO THE 
WEST AND FLOW AROUND THE RIDGE COMES MORE FROM THE NW. SATURDAY 
NIGHT RAIN CHANCES DROP OFF AS TEMPERATURES COOL FROM DAY TIME 
HEATING AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY SINKS SOUTH. SUNDAY UPPER RIDGE TRIES 
TO REBUILD SOMEWHAT ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. THINK DAY TIME HEATING 
WILL STILL BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SCATTERED ACTIVITY DURING THE DAY 
AND CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING. MONDAY LOW PRESSURE WITH A COLD FRONT 
MOVES INTO THE LOWER OHIO AND MS VALLEYS WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
STORMS TO CONTINUE AND INCREASE ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
SECTIONS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. A LARGE UPPER TROUGH REPLACES THE 
RIDGE BY MID WEEK. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD FINALLY MOVE THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES STILL MUCH ABOVE NORMAL SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY WITH LOWS MOSTLY LOWER TO MID 60S AND HIGHS IN THE 80S. 
FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MOS GUIDANCE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH REMAINDER OF THE 
EXTENDED. LOWS WILL DROP TO THE 50S BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HIGHS 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY MID 70S TO LOWER 80S. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN THURSDAY BEHIND FRONT WITH LESS CLOUD COVER AND 
TEMPERATURES NEAR SEASONAL NORMAL AND NO RAIN.

.DISCUSSION...
HAVE TWEAKED THE FORECAST TO ACCOUNT FOR THE LATEST TRENDS WITH THE
TRACK AND WEATHER IMPACTS FROM AN UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE PROGGED
TO PUSH INTO THE VOLUNTEER STATE LATER TODAY. AS OF 14Z...THE AREA
OF LOW PRESSURE WAS CENTERED ROUGHLY OVER THE TENNESSEE RIVER IN
EXTREME NORTHWEST ALABAMA AND WEST CENTRAL TENNESSEE. THIS SYSTEM
AND ITS ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN SLOWER IN MOVING TO THE
NORTH AND EAST THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT...THOUGH MODELS STILL
CONTINUE TO INDICATE A GENERAL NNE MOTION THROUGH CENTRAL TENNESSEE
OVER THE COURSE OF THE DAY AND EVENING. ANY PRECIPITATION
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM HAS REMAINED ROUGHLY ALONG THE I-65
CORRIDOR OF ALABAMA AND TENNESSEE...THOUGH RECENT RADAR TRENDS HAVE
SHOWN SOME MORE EASTERLY MOVEMENT/DEVELOPMENT WITHIN THE PAST HOUR
OR SO.

GIVEN THIS...HAVE OPTED TO LOWER POPS INITIALLY THIS MORNING
ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA...BEFORE INCREASING CHANCES
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU REGION FOR
THE AFTERNOON AS THIS SYSTEM SLOWLY PROGRESSES EASTWARD. CURRENT
THINKING IS THAT LOCATIONS ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA WILL GENERALLY REMAIN DRY AND PARTLY SUNNY FOR MOST OF THE
DAY...BEFORE SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION MAY DEVELOP LATE IN THE DAY
AND EARLY EVENING. IN FACT...GIVEN THE WEAKER CAP IN PLACE ACROSS
THIS AREA...THE MAIN MODE OF PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE EASTERN TWO-
THIRDS OF THE CWA MAY BE DIURNAL OR OROGRAPHIC INDUCED CONVECTION.
THE ONLY OTHER TWEAK WAS TO TEMPERATURES AS SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER
VALUES ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE APPEAR LIKELY GIVEN THE
PERSISTENT CLOUD COVER/HIGHER RAIN POTENTIAL. MEANWHILE...VERY
WARM READINGS /MID-UPPER 80S/ IN THE UPPER TENNESSEE VALLEY ARE
EXPECTED GIVEN THE GREATER INSOLATION AND THICKNESS VALUES THERE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
AND ITS ASSOCIATED FLUX OF DEEP MOISTURE WILL BUILD INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TODAY AND TONIGHT INCREASING THE CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS MAINLY ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. 
BY LATE AFTERNOON RAIN CHANCES WILL INCREASE OVER THE EASTERN HALF 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A BIT OF A CAP IN 
PLACE THIS MORNING THAT WILL BREAK DOWN BY MID DAY INTO THE 
AFTERNOON ALLOWING FOR THE FORMATION OF A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. THE 
DEEPER MOIST AXIS AND LIFT WITH THE UPPER LEVEL FEATURE WILL SHIFT 
TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT INCREASING THE CHANCE OF RAIN ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
MODERATED TO SOME DEGREE ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS WITH INCREASED 
CLOUD COVER AND RAIN WHILE SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE ENJOY A LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE. THEREFORE...HIGH 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE A LITTLE WARMER IN THIS AREA THAN SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. CONCERNING LOW TEMPS 
TONIGHT...ADJUSTED CLOSER TO THE WARMER SUGGESTED MINS DUE TO 
BLANKET OF CLOUDS AND HIGHER DEWPOINT AIR IN PLACE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT...IN THE EARLY PERIODS...CONTINUING TO WEAKEN THE UPPER 
RIDGE OUR AREA AND CONTINUE WITH THE MORE DOMINANT RIDGE OVER 
TEXAS.  BY EARLY NEXT WEEK OVER OUR AREA...THE RIDGE HAS COMPLETELY 
RECEDED AND THE FLOW HAS GONE ZONAL...WITH A LARGE TROUGH MAKING ITS 
WAY OUT OF THE ROCKIES AND TOWARD THE MISS VALLEY.  

DURING THIS PERIOD...SINCE RIDGE HAS RECEDED MINOR DISTURBANCES IN 
THE FLOW ARE A POSSIBILITY/LIKELIHOOD...BUT TIMING WILL BE 
DIFFICULT.  MODELS SHOW DECENT AGREEMENT IN A DISTURBANCE MOVING 
THROUGH LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY IN THE NW FLOW.  TREATED 
POPS ON SATURDAY WITH THIS SCENARIO. ALSO ADJUSTED TEMPS 
SLIGHTLY...WARMED OVERNIGHT LOWS FRIDAY NIGHT A COUPLE OF DEGREES AND 
DELAYED DIRUNAL WARM-UP SATURDAY DUE TO INCREASED CLOUD COVER AS 
DISTURBANCE MOVES THROUGH.

AT THE SURFACE FORCING SHOULD BE WEAK THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD A MODERATE TO STRONG FRONT LOOKS LIKE 
IT COULD BE NEARING THE AREA.

VERY MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE FORECAST PACKAGE THIS MORNING. AN

DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE REGION. WITH PREVAILING
SOUTHWEST FLOW AND SIMILAR 700/850 MB TEMPS AND THICKNESS VALUES TO
YESTERDAY...NEAR RECORD TO RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED
ACROSS THE REGION BY THIS AFTERNOON ONCE AGAIN /WITH THE MERCURY
PEAKING IN THE MID 80S TO AROUND 90 DEGREES AREAWIDE EXCEPT IN THE
HIGHER TERRAIN/. THE ONE FORECAST CONCERN WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR
SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION THAT SHOULD DEVELOP ALONG THE
SPINE OF THE SMOKIES AND POTENTIALLY NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODELS ARE SHOWING
SOME APPRECIABLE INSTABILITY VALUES TO WORK WITH IN LOCATIONS WITH
A WEAKER/BROKEN CAP. HOWEVER...SUBSIDENCE WILL ALSO BE ON THE
INCREASE AS THE AFOREMENTIONED UPPER-RIDGE AXIS SCOOTS TOWARD THE
AREA...WHICH WOULD ACT TO SUPPRESS THUNDER CHANCES ACROSS MOST OF
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. AS SUCH...HAVE MAINTAINED SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE HIGH TERRAIN OF THE SMOKY MTNS...BUT DID NOT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A 
SURFACE THROUGH UPPER LEVEL RIDGE EXPANDING FROM THE SOUTHEAST 
ATLANTIC COAST STATES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS REVEAL SUBSIDENCE WITHIN THE RIDGE WILL PRODUCE A BIT OF 
WARMING AROUND 800-700 MB WHICH WILL TEND TO LIMIT CONVECTION OVER 
MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. THE BEST SHOT AT SEEING ISOLATED 
CONVECTION WILL BE OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WHERE THE ATMOSPHERE IS 
PROGGED TO BE JUST A LITTLE BIT LESS STABLE. OROGRAPHIC LIFT MAY AID 
DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA AS 
WELL.
THE BIG STORY TODAY WILL BE THE HEAT AS HIGH TEMPERATURES WARM INTO 
THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 80S ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE WILL LIKELY WARM TO AROUND 90 DEGREES FOR A SECOND 
STRAIGHT DAY.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE
IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH BREAKING DOWN THE RIDGE OVER THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY ENOUGH TO INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY
AND FRIDAY. MAIN FORCING WILL BE OROGRAPHIC...SO GREATEST POPS WILL
BE ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN. FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...A WEAK COLD
FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA KEEPING A CHANCE OF MAINLY AFTERNOON

AREAS AND SMOKIES. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SEEING A FEW THUNDERSTORMS 
DEVELOPING ALONG AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM CONVECTION TRACKING ALONG 
AN OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER KY/WV.  ADDITIONALLY..A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE AREA DUE TO STRONG DAYTIME 
HEATING AND AN UNSTABLE AIR MASS.  EVENING CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN 
LIMITED AND MUCH OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD WEAKEN THEN DISSIPATE 
OVERNIGHT.  FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH WILL SLOWLY LIFT FARTHER 
NORTHWARD...CARRYING CONVECTIVE CHANCES WITH IT.  HOWEVER...AIR MASS 
WILL ONCE AGAIN DESTABILIZE ON WEDNESDAY AND COULD SEE SOME DIURNAL 
CONVECTION DEVELOP MAINLY OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE AFTERNOON.  
AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL CONTINUE TO SEE HOT CONDITIONS WITH 80S 
TO AROUND 90 DEGREES EXPECTED ACROSS THE VALLEY LOCATIONS WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON.

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...THIS PART OF THE 
FORECAST BEGINS WITH A WEAK UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA THAT THE 
MODELS AGREE WILL WEAKEN IN LATER PERIODS AND WITH THE GFS ALSO 
RETROGRADING THIS RIDGE WWD...LEAVING US IN MORE OF A NWLY UPPER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
SHOWERS ACROSS KY ARE ON THE TAIL END OF A DEPARTING SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH. SOME OF THESE SHOWERS MAY CLIP THE EXTREME NORTHERN FRINGES 
OF THE CWA THIS MORNING. ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT IS 
EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON AHEAD OF ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH NOW OVER 
THE PLAINS. NORTHERN AREAS WILL BE FAVORED AS IT TRACKS ACROSS THE 
OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT ALL LOCATIONS 
COULD SEE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AS THE 
CAP IS QUITE WEAK. WITH THE NAM SHOWING MLCAPE VALUES OF 1500-2000 
J/KG THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...LARGE HAIL WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH 
ANY STORMS THAT DEVELOP.

THE RIDGE OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST WILL RETROGRADE THROUGH 
THURSDAY...BECOMING CENTERED OVER UPSTATE SC. A RIDGE AXIS WILL BE 
EXTENDING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...AND THIS WILL STRENGTHEN 
THE MIDLEVEL CAP AND SUPPRESS CONVECTION WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. IT 
WILL ALSO PROVIDE THE WARMEST TEMPS OF THE YEAR SO FAR...WITH HIGHS 
AROUND 90 IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY TO UPPER 80S NORTH BOTH DAYS. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE
FORECAST WITH THE GFS SOMEWHAT MORE AMPLIFIED WITH BREAKING DOWN
SOUTHEASTERN STATES RIDGE AS A DEEP UPPER LOW DROPS SOUTHEAST FROM
VICINITY OF HUDSON BAY ON FRIDAY ENDING UP OVER NEW ENGLAND ON
MONDAY. THE GFS BRINGS A SYNOPTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH THE AREA
ON SUNDAY WITH RELATIVELY SIGNIFICANT COOLING SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH
MONDAY. STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE ECMWF/CMC WHICH ARE LESS
EAGER TO BRING A FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. THE
MODELS DO SEEM TO AGREE ON THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME MCS ACTIVITY
MOVING THROUGH THE DEVELOPING NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AROUND THE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY TIME FRAME.
THEREFORE USED A LOW CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION NORTHERN TWO THIRDS
WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA. STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS ON MONDAY WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF THE FRONTAL
BOUNDARY MAKING PROGRESS INTO THE REGION. STAYED RATHER CLOSE TO
MEX MOS TEMPS THROUGH SATURDAY AND THEN HAD TO ADJUST SEVERAL
DEGREES HIGHER FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY.

80S ONCE AGAIN ACROSS MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...LACK OF A FOCUSING 
FEATURE SUCH AS A FRONT DURING THE EXTENDED PERIODS...SUGGESTS  
MOSTLY DIURNAL CONVECTION OF LESS THAN SCATTERED COVERAGE. HOWEVER 
THE UPPER RIDGE DOES PERIODICALLY BREAK DOWN...WHICH COULD ALLOW FOR

OF CONFIDENCE IN ADJUSTING POPS FOR BREAKS (NO OR VERY LOW POP) IN

307 PM EDT SUN APR 29 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...TEMPS WELL INTO THE 70S TO MID
80S THIS AFTERNOON AND OUR WARM AIR ALOFT CONTINUES TO CAP OFF ANY
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. NOT THAT MUCH WOULD DEVELOP ANYAWAY...AS 
LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE HAS BEEN VERY LACKING OVER OUR FORECAST AREA. 
DEW POINT TEMPS VERY CLOSE TO YESTERDAY AND I THINK THAT CUMULUS
CLOUDS DISSIPATE AND DEBRIS CLOUDS THIN OUT AFTER MIDNIGHT. THIS
SHOULD FAVOR THE COOLER GFS MOS MINS. ADDED SOME PATCHY FOG IN THE
VALLEYS LATE TONIGHT.

FOR MONDAY...GFS IS PROBABLY A LITTLE ROBUST WITH COVERAGE OF
CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION IN THE 18Z TO 00Z PERIOD. NAM SOUNDINGS
SHOW THE CAPPING INVERSION A BIT WEAKER FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON...
BUT I JUST DON'T SEE ENOUGH OF A FOCUS FOR MORE THAN ISOLATED TSRA. 
THUS...I KEPT OUR MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR THE NRN AREAS
PLUS THE SMOKIES. NAM COULD VERY WELL BE CORRECT...WHICH WOULD
YIELD DRY AGAIN. A BIT WARMER EACH DAY...BUT I STAYED A DEGREE OR
TWO BELOW THE WARMER GFS MOS. THIS STILL PRODUCES NEAR RECORD HIGH
FOR TRI FOR 4/30...WITH RECORD HIGH 86 DEGREES IN 1986 AND 1970.
LOWER 90S ARE RECORD HIGHS FOR CHA/TYS...SO OUT OF REACH FOR NOW. 


.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A SERIES OF WEAK SHORT 
WAVES WILL RIDE ALONG AN OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY POSITIONED TO OUR NORTH 
EARLY IN THE EXTENDED.  THIS WILL ALLOW OCCASIONAL SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO MOVE ACROSS THE MRX CWA...MAINLY OVER NORTHERN 
AREAS.  STRONGEST OF THE WAVES MOVES THROUGH ON TUESDAY...PROVIDING OUR 
BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION THROUGH THE EXTENDED.  THE BOUNDARY LIFT 
FURTHER NORTH OF THE REGION FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...LIMITING 
CONVECTION TO MAINLY NORTHERN AREAS AS WELL AS THE POTENTIAL FOR 
DIURNAL CONVECTION OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  WILL LEAVE LOW POPS ACROSS 
THE AREA FOR FRIDAY AND AGAIN ON SATURDAY.  KEPT THINGS DRY ON 
SUNDAY THROUGH MODELS HINTING AT AN APPROACHING BOUNDARY.

COUNTIES OF SW VA. LATEST RADAR SHOWS ANY ONGOING CONVECTION WELL
TO OUR NORTH WITH MOVEMENT MOSTLY EAST. I KEPT THE PREVIOUS POP
GRIDS FOR TONIGHT...WITH LOW POPS OVER SW VA AND JUST INTO NRN MOST
COUNTIES OF E TN. CONSIDERING HOW MUCH FOG OCCURRED OVER SE TN
FRIDAY NIGHT...I CHOSE TO INCLUDE PATCHY FOG AGAIN FOR THAT AREA. 
MOS MINS LOOKED REASONABLE GIVEN CURRENT DEW POINT TEMPS AND
POSSIBLY SOME CLOUD COVER OVER NRN AREAS TONIGHT.

FOR SUNDAY...GIVEN THE DRY LOOK TO LATEST SHORT RANGE MODELS...I
OPTED TO LOWER OR REMOVE POPS FOR SUNDAY. I AM NOT SURE HOW MUCH OF
A FACTOR THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WOULD BE (OR IF IT ACTUALLY
DRIFTS BACK THIS FAR SOUTH?). DROPPED POPS FOR SE TN/SW NC AND
LOWERED TO JUST SLIGHT CHANCE ELSEWHERE...AND MAINLY AFTERNOON.
THIS ALSO MESHED BETTER WITH NWS NEIGHBORS GRIDS. STAYED CLOSER TO
THE NAM MOS HIGHS (GFS WAS FEW DEGS WARMER).

CONVECTION...WILL KEEP MENTION OF SLIGHT POPS MAINLY NORTH AND ACROSS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY GENERALLY ALONG 
THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER...WITH A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS LINGERING 
SOUTH OF IT OVER NORTHERN AL AND NORTHERN GA. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHWARD TONIGHT AS A WARM FRONT...AS THE UPPER- 
LEVEL FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY AHEAD OF AN AMPLIFYING TROUGH OVER 
THE WESTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO 
AGAIN BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA OVER 
KENTUCKY AND SOUTHWEST VA ON SUNDAY. WHILE A FAIRLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AREAWIDE EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING... 
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD BE THE FOCUS FOR A LITTLE BETTER 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. AS A RESULT...WILL MENTION ISOLATED 
CONVECTION AREAWIDE THROUGH THE WEEKEND...BUT WILL MENTION SLIGHTLY 
HIGHER POPS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN DUE TO THEIR 
PROXIMITY TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM

DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON. FORECAST SOUNDINGS AT TYS AND TRI SHOW
STRONG CAPPING AND DRY/STABLE MIDLEVELS. CHA SHOWS MUCH BETTER

CLOUD COVER WILL MAKE TEMPS TRICKY TODAY...BUT GENERALLY STAYED
COOLER THAN THE GFS MOS.

AS LOW PRESSURE TRACKS EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS...A WARM

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ACTIVE WEATHER DAY ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE WEATHER ANTICIPATED. RADAR 
AND SATELLITE SHOWS AN AREA OF CONVECTION ACROSS WESTERN 
KENTUCKY...SOUTHERN ILLINOIS...AND SOUTHERN INDIANA. THESE STORMS 
ARE IN RESPONSE TO A 90-100KT UPPER JET MOVING SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY TODAY. THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF THE JET IS PRODUCING 
DIVERGENCE ALOFT. ALSO...WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS SITUATED ACROSS 
THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. THIS BOUNDARY ALONG 
WITH AN INCOMING WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.  SOME OF THESE STORMS WILL LIKELY BECOME SEVERE WITH 
THE MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND HEAVY 
RAINFALL. ISOLATED TORNADOES ARE POSSIBLE GIVEN THE EXPECTED 
SHEAR...BUT MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH BOW FEATURES.

THIS BOUNDARY WILL MOVE SOUTH OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT ENDING THE 
CHANCE OF CONVECTION. PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO KEEP SKIES 
MOSTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS THROUGH THE 
PERIODS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...OVERALL...THE DAYS IN THIS 
PART OF THE FORECAST WILL HAVE VERY LITTLE SIGNIFICANT UPPER LEVEL 
DYNAMICS PASSING THROUGH THE REGION...BUT AT THE SURFACE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARIES WILL BE IN THE AREA QUITE A BIT THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

AT THE START OF THIS PERIOD A STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE 
LOCATED JUST SOUTH OF THE CWA...ORIENTED W-E ACROSS N GA.  DURING 
THE DAY ON FRIDAY THE BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO LIFT NORTHWARD INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY.  HOWEVER...THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO SURGE SOUTHWARD 
AGAIN AS A SURFACE LOW ZIPS EASTWARD TO OUR NORTH AROUND SUNDAY.  

HIGH PRESSURE SLOWLY STARTS TO BUILD INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE 
FRONT...BUT THEN SHIFTS TO BUILD MORE EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS...RESULTING IN MORE OF A BACKDOOR FRONTAL SITUATION FOR 
EARLY NEXT WEEK.  RETURN FLOW STARTS IN THE MISS VALLEY 
QUICKLY...AND BY THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD ON WENDESDAY...THE 
RETURN FLOW SHOULD BE GETTING ESTABLISHED HERE AS WELL.  WITH GOOD 
AGREEMENT ON THIS RETURN FLOW...BUMPED UP DEW POINTS IN THE SOUTHERN 
AREAS AS KCHA SEEMED TOO LOW FOR LAST 24-36 HOURS OF FORECAST.  ALSO 
BUMPED UP MIN TEMP SLIGHTLY FOR TUE AND WED NIGHTS IN THE SOUTH.

SEVERE THREATS WILL BE LOW.

WEST...AHEAD OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AS IT MOVES SOUTHEASTWARD. 
WITH A NORTHWEST WIND FLOW ALOFT...MOST OF THIS CONVECTION SHOULD 
MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT...MAINLY 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH A MODERATELY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL WIND FLOW (40 
TO 50 KT) AND MODERATE HELICITY VALUES...THINK THAT SOME SEVERE 
TSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE LATER TONIGHT ALONG WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF 
AN ISOLATED TORNADO OR TWO. THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM IS NOT EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON...WHEN THE MODELS REVEAL A VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THUS...THINK THAT SEVERE TSTORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE AGAIN ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS COLD FRONT 
MAY COMPLETELY DRIFT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY MORNING... 
BUT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE BACK NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT LATER ON 
FRIDAY...AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. 
WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION SCATTERED CONVECTION THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT 
TO ACCOUNT FOR THE PROXIMITY OF THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGHOUT THE 
PERIOD. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...KEPT SOME SMALL POPS FOR 
THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE VIEWING AREA ON SATURDAY WITH FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY SLIPPING SLOWLY SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AS GREAT 
LAKES SHORT WAVE RIPS EAST. THE COLD FRONT MOVES OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION ON SUNDAY AND MAINTAINED MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR 
CONVECTION AS THE BOUNDARY SHIFTS SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS THE REGION. 
BASICALLY STEADILY BACK OFF PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION SUNDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A FOCUS FOR RAIN WITH 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING MOVING INTO THE EASTERN U.S. CANNOT RULE OUT 
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST WITH WEAK 
UPPER LEVEL ENERGY TRAVERSING SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AIRMASS ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY...SO USED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP AT THE END OF THE 
FORECAST PERIOD.

.AVIATION...LOW LEVELS A LITTLE SLOW TO MOISTEN THIS AFTERNOON TO
SUCH A DEGREE THAT IT IS HARD TO FIND MORE THAN A FEW CU OVER THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY. ALSO...STILL ENOUGH WARM AIR ALOFT TO SLOW DOWN
DEVELOPMENT. THEREFORE...CONVECTION WILL BE HARD TO FIND THIS
AFTERNOON AND VFR FLIGHT WILL BE THE RULE. THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE
THAT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL BUILD ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AROUND 01Z THURSDAY AND LATER AS SOME OF THE ONGOING
CONVECTION OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY DRIFTS EAST.
HOWEVER...THE BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE
AROUND 05Z THROUGH 10Z THURSDAY AS MODELS SEEM TO AGREE THAT A
THUNDERSTORM COMPLEX WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY THIS
EVENING...EVENTUALLY BUILDING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
LATER TONIGHT. THE BEST LIKELIHOOD FOR CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION
WILL BE AT TRI WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER PROBABILITY AT TYS AND CHA. USED
AN MVFR CEILING AT TRI BUT THERE IS A CHANCE THAT IT MAY LOWER TO
IFR AROUND DAYBREAK WITH SUFFICIENT RAINFALL IN THIS AREA.
BASICALLY HAVE THE FORECASTS MAINTAINING OR TRENDING TO VFR
EVERYWHERE BY 15Z THURSDAY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE 
UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A WARM FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHEAST OF IT 
ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND INTO SOUTHEAST TN. THIS WARM 
FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON...BRINGING A WARMER AND MORE MOIST AIR MASS INTO THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY RESULTING IN A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE A CAPPING STABLE LAYER BETWEEN 900 AND 700 MB 
THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS MOST CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE PENETRATION OF 
THIS CAP. 

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO TWEAK 
TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS...AND TO REMOVE ANY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WARM FRONT WILL PULL NORTH
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT IS CURRENTLY
PRODUCING AN AREA OF SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. THIS AREA OF SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH BY MID-
MORNING AS LIFT WEAKENS. MODELS SHOW INCREASING MOISTURE AND
INSTABILITY FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS WARM FRONT PULLS
NORTHEAST. ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO WARRANT INCLUSION OF A SLIGHT
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. FOR TONIGHT...A SHORT-WAVE
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH DIFLUENCE ALOFT AND
INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT AIDING TO PRODUCE AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. STEERING WINDS WILL PULL THIS AREA SOUTHEAST INTO
THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST OVERNIGHT. WILL HAVE HIGHEST
POPS TONIGHT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. 

ISOLATED STRONG TO POSSIBLY SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE. MAIN
CONCERN HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS ALONG WITH HEAVY RAIN.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...FRONTAL BOUNDARIES ARE MAJOR 
FACTORS FOR THE EARLY PERIODS OF THE LONG TERM...WITH A COLD FRONT 
SAGGING SOUTHWARD THURSDAY FROM THE SOUTHERN OHIO VALLEY. THIS FRONT 
SHOULD MAKE IT INTO EXTREME SRN PARTS OF TN ACROSS THE NC-SC STATE 
LINE BY FRIDAY MORNING...THEN MOVES NE AS A WARM FRONT. ADJUSTED 
POPS A BIT TO BETTER FIT THE LATEST MODEL TRENDS...AND OPTED TO 
NUDGE POPS UP A BIT ON THURSDAY IN LINE WITH GFS/ECMWF AND CANADIAN 
MODELS. THESE ALL ADVERTISE A GOOD SWATH OF CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION 
WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. TEMPS ALSO TWEAKED ACCORDINGLY.

UPPER FLOW AND SURFACE FEATURES A BIT UNCERTAIN FOR THE WEEKEND...
THEN SOME UPPER RIDGING ON MONDAY. THUS...MADE LITTLE CHANGES FOR 
NOW FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS...WITH POPS FOR THE WEEKEND AND DRY ON 
MONDAY. GFSX MOS TEMPS HAVE FLUCTUATED CONSIDERABLY FROM 24/00Z TO 
25/00Z RUNS...SO TRIED TO KEEP SOME CONTINUITY AND STAY IN LINE WITH 
NEIGHBORING NWS GRIDS. 

GFSX MOS CONTINUES TO CARRY NEAR OR ABOVE CLIMO POPS FOR TUESDAY AND 
TUESDAY NIGHT...PLUS NWS NEIGHBORS HAVE POPS FOR DAY 7. FELT IT WAS

WED NIGHT...THEN A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO SAG INTO THE AREA 
THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT.  THIS WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AREA EARLY ON.  WILL GO LIKELY NORTH WED

THE DECREASING POPS FOR TODAY. IT SHOULD BE BREEZY SO WILL CONTINUE 
THE ADVISORY.  TEMPERATURE AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON 
TRACK...WILL UPDATE TO LOWER POPS FOR TODAY. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR RETURNS HAVE BEEN RATHER 
SPARSE AND WEAK SO FAR OVERNIGHT...BUT MOISTURE DOES APPEAR TO BE 
ROTATING SOUTH FROM THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. MODEL FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS FOR THIS MORNING DO SHOW STEEP LAPSE RATES AND CAPES OF 
AROUND 50 J/KG OR HIGHER. THUS...I STILL EXPECT SOME SHOWERS TO 
DEVELOP AND PASS ACROSS AT LEAST SW VA AND NE TN DURING THE MORNING 
HOURS. SOME SHOWERS WILL BE RAIN...SOME SNOW. INTERNET ACCESS HAS 
BEEN DOWN THIS MORNING...BUT PER 12 PLANET CHAT WINTER WEATHER DESK 
GRAPHICS ARE MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH THE DRIER NAM QPF AND LESSER 
SNOW AMOUNTS FROM THE NAM MODEL (GFS HEAVY QPF AND HEAVIER SNOW 
AMOUNTS NOT A GOOD CHOICE). NW LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW IS A POSITIVE 
FOR SNOW SHOWERS...BUT SURFACE AND BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS DON'T FAVOR 
MUCH SNOW. THUS...BACKED OFF SNOW JUST A BIT.

OTHERWISE...WINDS ARE INCREASING AND SHOULD BECOME QUITE GUSTY LATER 
THIS MORNING THROUGH THE DAY. WIND ADVISORY IS ON TRACK WITH NO 
CHANGES MADE. WINDS INHIBIT FROST TONIGHT...BUT I AGREE WITH 
NEIGHBORING NWS OFFICES ON A FREEZE WARNING FOR SMOKIES AND NRN 
MTNS...RUNNING FROM 4AM TO 9AM TUESDAY.

MOS GUIDANCE GENERALLY FOLLOWED EXCEPT FOR UNDERCUTTING MOS FOR 
HIGHS TODAY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD UPPER TROUGH BEGINS
TO SHIFT EAST TUESDAY. SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVES SOUTHEAST INTO THE
FORECAST AREA AROUND STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGE ACROSS EASTERN TWO
THIRDS OF THE COUNTRY. THIS WILL INCREASE CLOUDS ACROSS THE REGION
KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE AREA AND ALLOW WINDS TO
STY FAIRLY STRONG FROM THE WEST TO NORTHWEST. TEMPERATURES WILL
WARM INTO THE 60S EXCEPT UPPER 50S NORTHEAST AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS.
ANOTHER WEAK DISTURBANCE OR TWO WILL CONTINUE THIS PATTERN TUESDAY
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AND A WARM FRONT WILL HELP TO TRIGGER MORE
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS AS WARMER MORE UNSTABLE AIR MASS
MOVES IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST WEDNESDAY. BEST PRECIPITATION CHANCES
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AS NEXT COLD FRONT
APPROACHES AND THEN PASSES THROUGH. FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER LOW TRACKING SE THROUGH
KY AND WILL SLIDE SW VA TONIGHT. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE OFF NC COAST 
WILL DEEPEN AND MOVE INTO PA. NW WINDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT AND 
CONTINUE STRONG THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. NW FLOW PATTERN PRECIPITATION 
A GOOD BET OVERNIGHT WITH SEVERAL HOURS WITH HIGH RH IN THE SNOW 
GROWTH REGION. FREEZING LEVEL WILL FALL TO AROUND 3000 FEET WITH 
WILL ALLOW FOR SOME SNOW ACCUMULATION ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. 
LOWER ELEVATION MAY SEE SOME SNOW BUT SURFACE TEMPERATURE TOO WARM 
FOR ACCUMULATIONS. POWER LINES AND TREES MAY BE STRESSED BY THE 
HEAVY NATURE OF THE SNOW. GOOD SNOWFALL POTENTIAL BUT ACCUMULATION 
WILL BE DIFFICULT AND BRIEF. BRISK WIND AND LOW WINDS CHILLS VALUES 
WILL BE THE MOST REALIZED CONDITIONS COME MONDAY MORNING. THE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY MONDAY MORNING SO 
PRECIPITATION SHOULD TAPER OFF BY AFTERNOON. THE STRONG WINDS WILL 
CONTINUE AND WITH GOOD MIXING THE WIND ADVISORY MAY HAVE TO BE 
EXTENDED INTO CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS ON MONDAY. COLD 
TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE INTO MONDAY NIGHT. THE WINDS WILL ALSO 
REMAIN STRONG MOST AREAS. THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL LIKELY SEE 
FREEZING TEMPERATURES. NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SW VA LOWER 
ELEVATIONS WILL BE CLOSE TO FROST FREEZE CONDITIONS PENDING THE 
STRENGTH OF THE EARLY MORNING WINDS. A SPEED MAX MOVES INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE NW ON TUE WHICH MAY BRING SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION TO THE 
NORTHERN AREAS. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WEAK TROUGH TRACKS 
THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. DEEPEST MOISTURE 
REMAINS NORTH AGAIN SO WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH. A 
FRONT ENTERS THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND LINGERS INTO THURSDAY 
NIGHT SO WILL KEEP THE CHANCE POPS GOING. THE FRONT LINGERS ACROSS 
THE REGION ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...SO WILL KEEP THE 20 PERCENT

WEAK SURFACE HIGH OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. THE HIGH

LEAN TOWARD A NON-ECMWF BLEND.  WILL STILL CARRY LOW POPS FOR FRIDAY

SECOND AT ABOUT 5000-6000 FEET. THE UPPER LAYER APPEARS TO BE
MOVING OUT TO THE EAST WITH THE DEPARTING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. AFTER
THE HIGHER CLOUDS MOVE AWAY BELIEVE LOW LEVEL CLOUDS AND FOG WILL
FILL IN ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY AS THE NEAR SURFACE AIR BECOMES
SATURATED FROM THE PAST 18-24 HOURS RAINFALL AND LITTLE EVAPORATION
DURING THE DAY. LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ARE GENERALLY TOUGH TO NAIL DOWN

MOVED EAST AND WILL CONTINUE TO TAPER OFF. CLOUD COVER WILL SLOWLY 
ERODE FROM THE WEST TONIGHT. WEAK SURFACE LOW PRESSURE CONTINUES 
NEAR FLORIDA PANHANDLE WHILE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES FROM THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS SW THROUGH THE TN VALLEY. WIND FLOW WILL BE LIGHT AND 
MAINLY DOWN VALLEY FROM THE NE. AS THE CLOUD COVER DECREASES FOG 
WILL DEVELOP OVERNIGHT AND CONTINUE EARLY THURSDAY. LEANED COOLER 
WITH THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST GOING SLIGHTLY BELOW ECMWF/GFS/NAM. 
LATEST LAMP/HRRR/SREF RUNNING COOLER THAN FORECAST TEMPS.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
A MORE POTENT STORM SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TAKING SHAPE OVER THE WEST 
COAST TONIGHT SUCH THAT BY THURSDAY NIGHT THE HY5 TROF WILL BE 
SHARPENING UP LEE OF THE ROCKIES. ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT WILL 
EXTEND FROM MIDLAND TX TO GREEN BAY WI THURSDAY EVENING...WITH A 
SOUTHERLY SFC FLOW AHEAD OF IT. MOISTURE WILL BE ON THE INCREASE 
ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY. THE H5 TROF WILL CONTINUE TO 
DEEPEN AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE ARKLATEX FRIDAY EVENING WITH A SWATH 
OF RAIN FROM SOUTH TX TO THE GREAT LAKES. BY SATURDAY MORNING...AN 
H5 CUTOFF LOW WILL DEVELOP ALONG WITH A SFC LOW OVER THE 
NORTHCENTRAL GULF. LOCALLY...DURING THE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY 
TIME FRAME IS WHEN THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES WILL BEGIN...ALTHOUGH 
SOME LOW CHANCE POPS WILL APPEAR IN THE FORECAST PRIOR TO THEN. BUT 
IT IS AFTER SATURDAY THAT THE FORECAST GETS MURKY. BOTH THE GFS AND 
ECMWF DROP A SECOND PIECE OF ENERGY INTO THE TROUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT...THE ECMWF DROPS THIS ENERGY FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS SUCH 
THAT THE EC KEEPS A STRONG CLOSED LOW OVER THE CAROLINAS/VIRGINIA 
THROUGH MONDAY WHEREAS THE GFS OPENS UP THE SOUTHERN CLOSED LOW AS A 
NEW ONE DEVELOPS OVER OH/PA. THE EC VERSION KEEPS WRAP-AROUND PRECIP 
OVER PORTIONS OF OUR CWA THROUGH TUES WHILE THE GFS GENERALLY DRIES 
US OUT SUNDAY NIGHT. GIVEN THE RELATIVELY POOR MODEL PERFORMANCE 
WITH THIS SYSTEM SINCE LAST WEEK...WILL KEEP LOW POPS IN FOR MONDAY 
AND CONTINUE TO MONITOR.

.AVIATION...UPPER LEVEL AND SURFACE LOW PRESSURE MOVING NE THIS 
EVENING WILL SPREAD SHOWERS NNE INTO THE REGION. SOME ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY AND LIFT OVERNIGHT COULD ALLOW FOR ISOLATED TSRA. THIS 
LOOKS MOST LIKELY FOR TYS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS BASED ON RADAR 
AND LIGHTNING DETECTION. CEILINGS AND VISBYS SHOULD TREND DOWNWARD 
INTO MVFR CATEGORY FOR ALL 3 TAF SITES AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE WORST 
CONDITIONS LINGER AT TRI WHERE SHOWERS ALSO END LAST. 

PREVIOUS AFD FOLLOWS...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS LOCATED 
JUST EAST OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS SOUTHWEST ACROSS NORTHERN 
GEORGIA AND NORTHERN ALABAMA. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A SHORT-WAVE 
TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT AND WEDNESDAY WITH 
A 115 KT UPPER LEVEL JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS JET WILL PLACE 
THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE 
JET. DIRECT CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RRQ WILL ENHANCE THE 
FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY. THIS LIFT IS 
ALREADY PRODUCING AN AREA OF RAIN ACROSS SOUTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE 
AND NORTHERN ALABAMA. 

THIS LIFT WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT AND THE FIRST 
HALF OF WEDNESDAY PRODUCING WIDESPREAD RAIN/SHOWERS. IN THE 
SHORT-TERM DECENT INSTABILITY OVER THE FAR EAST AND SOUTHEAST AREAS 
TO PRODUCE THUNDERSTORMS. FOR OVERNIGHT...SOUNDINGS SHOW ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY ACROSS THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA TO INCLUDE 
THUNDER AS WELL. 

LIFT FROM FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING WILL DECREASE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
WITH DIMINISHING RAIN INTENSITY AND COVERAGE FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS VALUES 
CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS 
ARE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH THE MAIN STORY BEING THE HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING DURING THE WEEKEND. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT 
AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL CREATE DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE 
THAT A HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL CREATE A STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY...WHICH 
WILL THEN MOVE UP THE EASTERN SEABOARD EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS 
SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN A GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY...WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS EXPECTED EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE 
JET. DIRECT CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE RRQ WILL ENHANCE THE 
FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY. THIS LIFT IS 
ALREADY PRODUCING AN AREA OF RAIN ACROSS SOUTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE 
AND NORTHERN ALABAMA. 

THIS LIFT WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT AND THE FIRST 
HALF OF WEDNESDAY PRODUCING WIDESPREAD RAIN/SHOWERS. IN THE 
SHORT-TERM DECENT INSTABILITY OVER THE FAR EAST AND SOUTHEAST AREAS 
TO PRODUCE THUNDERSTORMS. FOR OVERNIGHT...SOUNDINGS SHOW ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY ACROSS THE EASTERN AND SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA TO INCLUDE 
THUNDER AS WELL. 

LIFT FROM FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING WILL DECREASE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
WITH DIMINISHING RAIN INTENSITY AND COVERAGE FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS VALUES 
CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS 
ARE IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH THE MAIN STORY BEING THE HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING DURING THE WEEKEND. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT 
AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL CREATE DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE 
THAT A HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL CREATE A STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY...WHICH 
WILL THEN MOVE UP THE EASTERN SEABOARD EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS 
SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN A GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY...WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS EXPECTED EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

.DISCUSSION....FRONT TRACKING THROUGH THE AREA. LIGHTNING IS LIMITED 
SO WILL UPDATE FORECAST TO REMOVE THUNDER AND THE EVENING WORDING. 
TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK...NO OTHER 
CHANGES PLANNED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION... 

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...A WEAKENING PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH 
IS MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. ONLY SCATTERED 
SHOWERS ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS BOUNDARY. MARGINAL INSTABILITY 
NOTED ALONG THIS BOUNDARY WITH CAPES OF 500+ J/KG. SPC MESO-ANALYSIS 
DOES SHOW MOISTURE CONVERGENCE ALONG THE INCOMING FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
LOCATED OVER THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. AS FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE AREA 
SCATTERED CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE WITH ISOLATED STRONG STORMS. MAIN 
CONCERN BEING STRONG GUSTY WINDS UP TO 45 MPH AND SMALL HAIL.  

CONVECTION WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET WITH ONLY WIDELY 
SCATTERED SHOWERS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT.

FOR TUESDAY...MODELS SHOW THIS BOUNDARY BECOMING QUASI-STATIONARY 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A SHORT-WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE OUT OF 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO TO THE SOUTHEAST TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. 
DEPENDING ON THE EXACT LOCATION OF BOUNDARY...FRONTAL-GENETIC 
FORCING WILL RE-IGNITE THE STATIONARY BOUNDARY. A 90-100KT JET OVER 
THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PLACE THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS UNDER THE 
FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION. THE DIRECT CIRCULATION WITH THE JET 
WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTAL-GENETIC FORCING PRODUCING PERIODS OF 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE 
IN REASONABLE AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...AND REVEAL TWO LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS AFFECTING THE 
FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND THE WEEKEND. AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE IS PROGGED TO BE LOCATED OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT...WITH A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE CAROLINAS. THIS 
SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN A GOOD COVERAGE OF SHOWERS OVER THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING. ZONAL UPPER- 
LEVEL FLOW AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN CREATE DRY AND 
TRANQUIL CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...WITH A 
COLD FRONT PROGGED TO APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT. 
BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS REVEAL A HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH DEVELOPING BEHIND THIS FRONT FOR THE WEEKEND...RESULTING IN A 
DEEP CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
THIS SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN AN UNSETTLED PATTERN WITH BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBER THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE WEAK COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST 
WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT.  CONVECTIVE LINE 
TO OUR WEST IS WEAKENING...AND MODELS HAVE BEEN BACKING OFF ON 
PRECIP FOR OUR AREA TODAY.  GIVEN MODEST INSTABILITY AND WEAK 
FORCING WILL JUST CARRY LIKELY POPS WEST TODAY WITH CHANCE 
ELSEWHERE...THEN CHANCE POPS TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL SLIP JUST EAST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE BLUE RIDGE MOUNTAINS BY 
12Z TUESDAY BUT WILL NOT MAKE MUCH FURTHER PROGRESS AS A SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORT WAVE TROUGH SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST FROM THE ARKLATEX REGION 
TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. THIS SCENARIO WILL 
REQUIRE HIGHER POPS FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WHERE DEEPER 
MOISTURE/LIFT WILL BE PRESENT IN THE VICINITY OF THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. HAD TO KEEP THE SLIGHT THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS GOING ACROSS MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA 
MAINLY TUESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE 
MAKES ITS WAY EAST. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING OVER THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY 
DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN HOW QUICKLY THIS FEATURE AND ASSOCIATED 
MOISTURE MOVES ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS BUT MOST OF THE REGION WILL BE 
DRY WITH SUNSHINE RETURNING. THURSDAY SHOULD BE A BETTER DAY PLENTY 
OF SUNSHINE AND TEMPERATURES REBOUNDING BACK ABOVE NORMAL. NEXT 
UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION/CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF THE ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT WILL MEAN THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
BE STEADILY INCREASING LATER IN THE DAY FRIDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. 
PLACED THE HIGHEST LIKELIHOOD FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE 
FORECAST ON SATURDAY AS THE COLD FRONT MAKES ITS WAY ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. USED LIKELY POPS AT THIS TIME AS MODEL 
FORECAST SHOW THIS SYSTEM UNDERGOING MAJOR AMPLIFICATION BY WEEKS 
END. BOTH THE ECMWF AND THE GFS DEEPEN THE SYSTEM SUFFICIENTLY FOR 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF A CLOSED UPPER LOW IN THE VICINITY OF THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS DURING THE DAY SUNDAY. PLENTY OF MOISTURE WILL BE 
AVAILABLE FOR SHORT WAVE LIFTING SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY FOR THE 
GENERATION OF SHOWERS SO STAYED WITH SOME CHANCE POPS DURING THIS

INTO THE AREA IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW...BUT SHOULD BE PRECIP FREE  FOR

INCREASED MOISTURE...BUT STILL PLENTY OF SUNSHINE.  TEMPS WILL BE 
WELL ABOVE NORMAL.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST 
SOME MINOR TWEAKS.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SHORT WAVE ENERGY PASSES 
NORTHEAST FROM THE MIDWEST INTO NEW ENGLAND 12Z MONDAY THROUGH 12Z 
TUESDAY. A NARROW BAND OF DEEP MOISTURE WILL ACCOMPANY A COLD FRONT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SHORT WAVE GENERATING A DECENT CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MAINLY MONDAY 
AFTERNOON THROUGH EARLY EVENING. THE MODELS CONTINUE TO HAVE 
PROBLEMS WITH A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE TRAILING MONDAY'S FRONTAL 
SYSTEM WHICH REDUCES FORECAST CONFIDENCE DURING THE TUESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY TIMEFRAME. DECIDED TO GO WITH THE SLOWER/MORE AMPLIFIED 
ECMWF/CMC RATHER THAN THE LESS AMPLIFIED AND FASTER NAM/GFS. 
THEREFORE...KEPT SLIGHT AND CHANCE POPS GOING TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY 
DUE TO PASSAGE OF RELATIVELY STRONG SHORT WAVE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WAS ABLE TO KEEP THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING 
DRY WHILE AWAITING NEXT UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM.

SEE SOME VARYING AMOUNTS OF MAINLY HIGH AND MID CLOUDS TODAY...WITH

TREND WILL CONTINUE...AND WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.    

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...PROTECTIVE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
ALLOWS FOR MORE GREAT WEATHER ON SUNDAY BUT IS SHOVED EAST TO THE 
ATLANTIC SEABOARD ON MONDAY AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY BUILDS EAST ACROSS 
THE UPPER MIDWEST. AS THIS HAPPENS A COLD FRONT WILL BE PULLED 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY LATE EVENING. ADJUSTED 
POPS A LITTLE HIGHER FOR CONVECTION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS 
MODELS APPEARED TO BE IN AGREEMENT WITH A LITTLE FASTER MOVEMENT OF 
THIS SYSTEM THAN PREVIOUS RUNS. MODEL SOLUTIONS START TO DIVERGE 
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WITH THE 00Z ECMWF THE SLOWEST AND MOST 
AMPLIFIED WITH A TRAILING SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE WHICH PRODUCES 
A NICE SHOT OF POST FRONTAL PRECIPITATION LATER MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT. BASICALLY WRAPPED UP THE EVENT BY 12Z WEDNESDAY GOING 
CLOSER TO THE FASTER 00Z GFS FOLLOWED BY THE 00Z CANADIAN WHICH 
SEEMED TO BE A MORE ACCURATE FORECAST DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE ECMWF 
DOES NOT END PRECIP OVER THE REGION UNTIL LATE THURSDAY. GOING WITH 
THE FASTER SOLUTIONS ALLOWS A RETURN TO SOME SUNSHINE AS EARLY AS 
WEDNESDAY. THE FAIR WEATHER REGIME SHOULD LAST THROUGH THE DAYTIME 
HOURS FRIDAY WITH A NICE WARMING TREND. APPLIED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
IN THE GRIDS FRIDAY NIGHT WITH MODELS EAGER TO BRING ANOTHER UPPER 
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM INTO THE EASTERN U.S. BY THIS 
TIME.

MAV TEMPS.    

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WENT A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE 
00Z ECMWF AND CANADIAN MODELS THROUGH THE PERIOD AS THE GFS BECOMES 
A LITTLE TOO PROGRESSIVE WITH THE EARLY WEEK SYSTEM. AMPLIFYING 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE SHOULD KEEP THE FORECAST AREA DRY OVER THE WEEKEND 
WITH A NICE WARMUP AS SUBSIDENCE AND SOUTHERLY WINDS HELP BOOST 
TEMPERATURES BACK ABOVE NORMAL. THE WARMEST DAYS APPEAR TO BE SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY WITH STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL FLOW OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO. 
AS A SHORT WAVE TROUGH SHIFTS NORTHEAST FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE 
GREAT LAKES DURING THE DAY MONDAY DEEP MOISTURE WILL BE LIFTED AHEAD 
OF A COLD FRONT WHICH SHOULD MAKE PROGRESS INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE BY 
00Z TUESDAY. ADJUSTED PROBABILITY OF CONVECTION FROM SLIGHT CHANCE 
DURING THE DAY MONDAY TO MEDIUM THROUGH LIKELY POPS MONDAY NIGHT AS 
THE WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE LAKES. THE MEAN UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO 
AMPLIFY ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON TUESDAY AS A RELATIVELY 
SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE PRESSES EAST NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. 
APPLIED LIKELY POPS ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AS 
THIS FEATURE DRAGS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS BY TUESDAY NIGHT. HELD ONTO SOME POST FRONTAL POPS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT IS MAKING ITS WAY 
THROUGH THE FORECAST HOUR THIS AFTERNOON. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT BKN 
ALTO CU CEILINGS HAVE LIMITED EVAPORATION AT THE SURFACE KEEPING 
RELATIVE HUMIDITY SOMEWHAT ELEVATED. THIS LAYER WILL SLIP STEADILY 
SOUTH ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH EARLY EVENING LEAVING SKIES CLEAR TO 
PARTLY CLOUDY. MODELS INDICATE THAT THERE MAY BE JUST A BIT TOO MUCH 
PRESSURE GRADIENT BEHIND THE FRONT OVERNIGHT AND THIS SHOULD KEEP 
THE LOW LEVEL FLOW FROM ENTIRELY DECOUPLING. THEREFORE...REMOVED THE 
FREEZE WARNING FROM THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
WHILE KEEPING THE PRODUCT IN PLACE FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MUCH 
OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. SHOULD BE A 
DECENT DAY RETURNING ON WEDNESDAY ALTHOUGH MAX TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
LIMITED TO THE 50S ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH LOWER AND  
MIDDLE 60S ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE SLIDES SE THROUGH THE AREA EARLY IN THE PERIOD. LIGHT WINDS 
AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO FALL TO FREEZING 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE MRX CWA AND THE MOUNTAINS 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHTS. THE RIDGE SLIDES INTO THE ATLANTIC 
OVER THE WEEKEND. SOUTHWEST RETURN FLOW COMMENCES WITH A WARMING 
TREND CONTINUING INTO NEXT WEEK. FRONTAL BOUNDARY BECOMES NEARLY 
STATIONARY NORTH OF THE AREA AND PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE CONFINED TO 
PROXIMITY OF FRONT. COLD FRONT MOVES EAST INTO TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE 
IN THE PERIOD. MAJORITY OF PRECIPITATION WITH THIS SYSTEM SHOULD 
OCCUR AROUND MID WEEK. USED MODEL BLEND WITH AVERAGE UNCERTAINTY 
WITH REGARDS TO TIMING OF NEXT WEEK SYSTEM.

A NICE DEWPOINT GRADIENT AND A BIT OF A TEMPERATURE GRADIENT ACROSS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED COLD FRONT OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH A 
DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHWARD TODAY...WITH GUSTY WINDS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP 
AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THE VERY DRY AIR MASS WILL COMBINE WITH 
THESE GUSTY WINDS TO CREATE AN ELEVATED FIRE DANGER AGAIN THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. IN FACT...IT APPEARS THAT SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN MAY NEED A RED FLAG WARNING...BUT WILL FIRST COORDINATE 
WITH FORESTRY OFFICIALS LATER THIS MORNING BEFORE ISSUING. THIS 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL PUSH AN UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR MASS INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT...WITH TEMPS FALLING INTO THE 
30S AND AREAS OF FROST DEVELOPING OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
WILL PLAN TO UPGRADE THE FREEZE WATCH TO A WARNING...AND WILL ALSO 
INCLUDE THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. WILL ISSUE A FROST ADVISORY 
FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
REGION SHOULD KEEP PRECIPITATION OUT OF AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
COOLER AIR TRACKING OVER THE REGION BRINGING AREAS OF FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES AND FROST ON EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING...AND AREAS OF 
FROST IS EXPECTED AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT OVER THE AREA. LOW

OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. WINDS HAVE DECREASED BUT THERE
STILL MIGHT BE A FEW GUSTS OVER THE NE AS THERE STILL IS A GOOD
PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN LOW PRESSURE OVER MA AND HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDING SOUTH ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES. SOME WIND OVERNIGHT WILL

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A VERY DRY AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...CREATING GUSTY WESTERLY 
WINDS...ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. THE VERY DRY 
AIR MASS WILL COMBINE WITH THESE GUSTY WINDS TO CREATE A HIGH FIRE 
DANGER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. IN FACT...IT APPEARS THAT 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN MAY NEED A RED FLAG WARNING...BUT WILL 
FIRST COORDINATE WITH FORESTRY OFFICIALS LATER THIS MORNING ABOUT 
ISSUING THIS AND POSSIBLY OTHER STATEMENTS. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND 
GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...DRY NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BE THE 
MAIN FEATURE OF THE FORECAST THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK. DEEP UPPER 
TROUGH ACROSS THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES/SOUTHEAST CANADA WILL KEEP 
THE UPPER FLOW NORTHWEST WITH A SERIES OF WEAK SHORT-WAVES PULLING 
WEAK COLD FRONTS ACROSS THE AREA RE-INFORCING THE CHILLY AIR. MAIN 
CONCERNS THROUGH FRIDAY WILL BE POTENTIAL OF FREEZE/FROST CONDITIONS 
FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HAVE ISSUED A FREEZE WATCH 
FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...AND SMOKY MOUNTAINS 
FOR TUESDAY. 

BESIDES THE POTENTIAL OF FREEZE/FROST CONDITIONS...LOW DEWPOINTS AND

314 PM EDT SAT APR 7 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...OPTED TO NOT MENTION MUCH
FROST FOR TONIGHT...DUE TO HIGH CLOUDS MOVING EASTWARD THROUGH THE
UPPER RIDGE...PLUS SOME LOW LEVEL RH INCREASE AS WEAK/DRY COLD
FRONT APPROACHES TOWARD 12Z SUNDAY. 850 MB TEMPS ALSO WARM A BIT.

KEPT FORECAST DRY FOR EASTER SUNDAY...EXCEPT FOR A MENTION OF
SPRINKLES LATE IN THE SMOKIES. CLOUDS CLEAR OUT SUNDAY NIGHT THEN
SUNNY WITH SEASONAL HIGHS AGAIN MONDAY. WILL LET LATER SHIFTS
DECIDE IF ANY FROST MENTION IS JUSTIFIED FOR SUNDAY NIGHT...
AS THIS WOULD BE LIMITED. 

MOS TEMPS WERE CLOSE FOR THESE PERIODS...ESPECIALLY HIGHS. BLENDED
MINS GENERALLY WHERE SLIGHT DIFFS WERE NOTED.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL 
PARK OVER THE EASTERN U.S. THROUGH MUCH OF THE WEEK KEEPING 
TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. A COUPLE OF SHORT 
WAVELENGTH FEATURES WILL ROTATE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF 
THE LONGWAVE TROUGH. KEPT A FEW SPRINKLES AND POSSIBLY A SNOW FLURRY 
IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE ON MONDAY NIGHT AND DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY COINCIDENT 
WITH EACH SHORT WAVE PASSAGE. SLIGHTLY WARMER AND MORE MOIST AIR 
WILL RETURN DURING THE LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD AS THE 
UPPER TROUGH EXITS MAKING ROOM FOR AN AMPLIFYING RIDGE. AS THE WARM 
AIR IS LIFTED OVER THE RETREATING COOLER AIR MASS A FEW SHOWERS WILL 
BE POSSIBLE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OFF THE SOUTHEASTERN GA COAST...WITH A TROUGH 
EXTENDING NORTHWEST OF IT BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AROUND THE MOUNTAINS 
OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH...BUT THESE 
SHOWERS SHOULD END BY THE AFTERNOON AS THIS UPPER TROUGH SWINGS 
EASTWARD OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE THEN 
BUILDS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BY TONIGHT...WHICH WILL 
SET THE STAGE FOR EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS AS SKIES 
CLEAR AND WINDS BECOME LIGHT. WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 30S 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...THINK THAT AREAS OF FROST 
WILL DEVELOP AND WILL ISSUE A FROST ADVISORY FOR THESE AREAS LATE 
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK 
REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN EMPHASIS DURING THE 
EXTENDED IS THE DEVELOPING LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST 
UNITED STATES/SOUTHEAST CANADA. A SERIES OF COLD FRONTS WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BEGINNING SUNDAY AND ANOTHER MONDAY. 
MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED AND ONLY EXPECT A SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE 
SHOWERS FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DUE TO OROGRAPHIC LIFT. 

AFTER MONDAY'S SHORT-WAVE PASSAGE...THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DIFFER 
GREATLY ON THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER WAVE ROTATING AROUND UPPER LOW 
FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. ECMWF SHOWS A STRONGER WAVE COMING ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH FAIRLY CHILLY THICKNESS TO SUPPORT 
MOUNTAIN SNOWS. HOWEVER...THE OPERATIONAL AND ENSEMBLE GFS DOES NOT 
SHOW THIS WAVE AT ALL. WILL TREND TOWARD THE GFS FOR THE EXTENDED 
PERIODS...AND WILL FOLLOW MEX MOS CLOSELY.

.DISCUSSION...MORNING CONVECTION IS EXITING NE CORNER OF FORECAST 
AREA...WHICH WILL LEAVE A FEW HOURS BEFORE MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS 
APPROACH FROM THE SW. GULF COAST CONVECTION COULD DELAY THE ONSET OF 
THIS NEW ACTIVITY. HOWEVER...THE UPPER LOW MADE A GOOD EASTWARD PUSH 
OVERNIGHT AND SHOULD BE TRACKINFG ESE ACROSS NRN MS THIS AFTERNOON. 
THUS...I WOULD EXPECT SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS COVERAGE IN THE

PLAN TO FRESHEN HOURLY GRIDS AND REMOVE MORNING WORDING FROM ZFP

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT LIES ACROSS
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH AN UPPER LOW OVER
WESTERN AR EARLY THIS MORNING. SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WERE
OCCURRING ACROSS NORTHERN TN AND SW VA THIS MORNING WITH SHOWERS
EXTENDING ACROSS EASTERN KY. THE COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY DROP SOUTH
ACROSS TN AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES EAST SOUTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHEAST
STATES BY THIS EVENING AND TO THE SE COAST BY FRIDAY MORNING.
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE LATER TODAY AS SURFACE
HEATING ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TAKES PLACE AND AIR MASS BECOMES
UNSTABLE WITH THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT AS DEW POINTS WILL BE IN
THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. SOME STORMS MAY BECOME SEVERE
ESPECIALLY SOUTH OF THE FRONT WITH LARGE HAIL POSSIBLE AND DAMAGING
WINDS. LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN POSSIBLE ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE FRONT.
AIR MASS SHOULD BECOME MUCH MORE STABLE TONIGHT BUT SHOWERS WILL
CONTINUE UNTIL UPPER LOW MOVES EAST AND SOUTHEAST OF THE MOUNTAINS.
HAVE POPS DECREASE GRADUALLY TONIGHT. HIGHS COOLER IN THE 70S TODAY
EXCEPT 60S NE NORTH OF THE FRONT. LOWS WILL BE MUCH COOLER TONIGHT
AS FRONT WILL BE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.  

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN FOR THE WEEKEND WITH NW FLOW ALOFT. DRY CONDITIONS WITH 
TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL. REMAINDER OF FORECAST WILL DEPEND ON HOW 
UPPER LOW TAKES SHAPE OVER THE NE U.S. AND HOW FAR IT WILL 
RETROGRADE WEST. ALSO IN QUESTION IS HOW DEEP THE TROUGH BUILDS 
SOUTH. SHORT WAVE ENERGY DIVING INTO WESTERN SIDE OF UPPER TROUGH 
WILL BRING SOME REINFORCING COLD AIR ADVECTION. MOISTURE AND LOW 
RAIN CHANCE WILL BE LIMITED...MAINLY TO NE TN AN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. 
FREEZING TEMPERATURES APPEAR RESTRICTED TO THE MOUNTAINS ABOVE 3500 
FEET. NE VALLEYS WILL LIKELY SEE SOME FROST TUE AND WED MORNINGS.

WAS LOCATED OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS
THE SE STATES. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 50S TO MID 60S AT THIS
HOUR. SHORT WAVE ENERGY ACROSS KY AND OH IS TRIGGERING SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS CENTRAL KY AND SOUTHERN OH AT THIS
TIME. A FEW SHOWERS ARE ALSO OVER SE TN. THE ACTIVITY IN KY WILL
MOVE EAST AND MORE ACTIVITY NEAR THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL DEVELOP
LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE FRONT WILL SAG SOUTH INTO THE NORTHERN
SECTIONS BY TONIGHT AND BE A FOCUS FOR MORE SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS TONIGHT. A CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL STAY OVER THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS TODAY. HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT COMBINED WITH SURFACE
HEATING AND STEEP MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL CAUSE THE AIR MASS TO
BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE. ORGANIZED STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO
DEVELOP AND MOVE EAST INTO WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA
WITH LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL MAY PRODUCE SOME LOCALIZED FLOODING
OVER SW VA AND NORTHERN TN. WITH MORE CLOUD COVER EXPECTING
TEMPERATURES TO BE ABOUT 5 DEGREES COOLER. MILD TEMPERATURES AGAIN
TONIGHT. WENT CLOSE TO MAV NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CUT OFF UPPER LOW MOVES

SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. HIGHEST POPS WILL TRANSITION FROM NORTHERN
AREAS TO SOUTHERN AREAS BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING AS SYSTEM

EVENING. HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE THE MAJOR THREAT FROM THESE STORMS.
CHANCE POPS CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY AS THE CLOSED LOW MOVES THROUGH
THE SRN APPALACHIANS WHILE ABSORBING INTO THE MEAN NE U.S. TROUGH.

A DEEP RIDGE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY...PROVIDING MILD TEMPS AND MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. BY MONDAY A 
DEEP CYCLONIC CIRCULATION BECOMES POSITIONED OVER ONTARIO...WITH A 
STRONG JET ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDS FROM 
WEST CENTRAL KENTUCKY THROUGH EAST TENNESSEE...VICINITY MORRISTOWN 
AND CONTINUE SE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS INTO SOUTH 
CAROLINA. SIGNIFICANT DEW POINT GRADIENT ACROSS FRONT WITH LOWER 60S 
TO THE SW AND UPPER 40S TO UPPER 30S NE INTO SW VA. THIS FRONT WILL 
RETURN NORTH AS A WARM FRONT TODAY. GOOD DESTABILIZATION WILL AGAIN 
OCCUR WEST OF THE FRONT. LAPSE RATES AROUND 6.5C REMAIN IN PLACE. 
TRIGGERS ARE HARD TO FIND BUT DIFFERENTIAL HEATING WILL BE MAIN 
TRIGGER. WEAK WESTERLY STEERING ALOFT WILL RESULT IN SLOW MOVING 
STORMS WHICH MAY RESULT IN MINOR FLOODING. SMALL HAIL IS ALSO 
POSSIBLE. HIGH LOW LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES SUPPORT ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN WHERE 80S WILL BE 
COMMON. LOW CHANCE CONVECTION REMAINS POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT WITH VERY 
WARM TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...INCREASING CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY AS A SHORTWAVE PASSES THROUGH
THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. BEST CHANCES NORTH
DECREASING OVER THE EXTREME SOUTH. HIGHS SHOULD BE SEVERAL DEGREES
COOLER WITH EARLIER START TO SHOWERS. A COLD FRONT OVER KY WILL
SLIDE SOUTH INTO TN DURING THE DAY AND WILL HELP FOCUS MORE
PRECIPITATION OVER THE AREA. PRECIPITATION WILL DECREASE WEDNESDAY
EVENING BUT MORE ACTIVITY DEVELOPING AROUND THE CIRCULATION OF AN
UPPER LOW MOVING INTO THE MS AND OHIO VALLEYS COULD CONTINUE
CONVECTION ALL NIGHT. THE UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT SO RAIN CHANCES STAY HIGH AND MORE
THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE AS AIR MASS CONTINUES TO BE UNSTABLE. STILL
COOLER TEMPERATURES THURSDAY. UPPER LOW FINALLY SHIFTS EAST FRIDAY
WITH DECREASING CHANCE OF SHOWERS. RIDGING BUILDS BACK IN FRIDAY
NIGHT AND SATURDAY WITH DRY CONDITIONS. A FAST MOVING COLD FRONT
WILL ONLY CAUSE A FEW SHOWERS SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WITH A BROAD
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES.

EXTENDING SOUTHEAST FROM NEAR EVV TO TYS. THE STORMS APPEAR TO BE
LOSING INTENSITY AS THE INSOLATION WANES. HOWEVER...EXPECT
ISOLATED DEVELOPMENT IN THE VICINITY OF THE BOUNDARY INTO THE LATER
EVENING PERIOD. NOT SO SURE HOW MUCH FURTHER SOUTH THIS FRONT WILL
SLIP AS THE ARKLATEX UPPER LOW EDGES A BIT FARTHER EAST PUSHING THE
NARROW RIDGE AXIS TOWARD THE EASTERN SEABOARD. THEREFORE...KEPT
THUNDER OUT OF CHA FOR TONIGHT BECAUSE DON'T BELIEVE THE CENTRAL
EAST TENNESSEE DEVELOPMENT WILL MAKE IT THIS FAR SOUTH BEFORE
DISSIPATING. THERE SHOULD BE SOME FAIRLY DECENT FOG DEVELOPMENT
TONIGHT AND USED PREVAILING MVFR VSBY IN FOG WITH IFR VSBY AND SOME
LIFR CEILINGS IN TEMPO GROUPS AT TRI AND TYS. STAYED QUITE A BIT
HIGHER AT CHA WHERE SOME OF THE CI DEBRIS SLOWS COOLING LATE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER AREA WILL ERODE OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF
DAYS...BUT ENOUGH PERSISTS ON TUESDAY FOR ANOTHER WARM AND HUMID
DAY. EXCEPTION WILL BE THE COOLER AND DRY AIR NUDGING IN FROM THE
NORTHEAST INTO SW VA. BUT THE SHORT TERM FEATURES ARE FAIRLY
UNIMPRESSIVE COMPARED TO THE EXTENDED FORECAST.

SCATTERED CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE VALLEY IN AND AROUND
MORRISTOWN AS WELL AS NEAR TRICITIES...COULD SEE ADDITIONAL
DEVELOPMENT THROUGH EARLY EVENING. SCATTERED CONVECTION AGAIN ON
TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH IN THE NW FLOW WILL BE PASSING OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS ON WEDNESDAY. NAM AND GFS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT IN THIS TIME FRAME. PRECIP CHANCES BEGIN RISING 
TUESDAY NIGHT...PEAKING WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WITH DIURNAL ENHANCEMENT 
FROM DAYTIME HEATING. WHILE A FRONT IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN NORTH OF 
THE AREA...THERE MAY BE SOME ENHANCED CONVERGENCE ACROSS NORTHERN 
AREAS IN THE AFTERNOON AS IT DRIFTS SOUTH. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON IN THE NORTH WITH CHANCE POPS SOUTH. 

A WEAK SHORTWAVE RIDGE ALOFT CROSSES THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT BEFORE 
A MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM APPROACHES FOR THURSDAY. THE MODELS BEGIN 
TO DIVERGE SOMEWHAT ON THE TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM...WITH THE GFS 
SHOWING A SLOWER NW-SE TRACK AND THE NAM SHOWING A FASTER DUE EAST 
TRACK FROM THE OZARKS ACROSS TN. FAVORABLE JET POSITIONING AND 
FALLING 500MB HEIGHTS BY BOTH MODELS SUGGEST LIKELY POPS ARE 
WARRANTED FOR THURSDAY. THE FRONT THAT WAS TO OUR NORTH BEGINS TO 
PUSH SOUTHWARD INTO THE AREA LATE THURSDAY. WITH THE FRONT IN OUR 
VICINITY...CHANCE POPS CONTINUE THURSDAY NIGHT...TAPERING OFF 
THROUGH FRIDAY AS THE UPPER LOW EXITS. COOLER TEMPS CAN BE EXPECTED 
UNDER DENSE CLOUD COVER FRIDAY...IN THE 60S TO LOWER 70S. 

A LARGE RIDGE WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND...GIVING 
SUNNY SKIES AND A GRADUAL WARMING TREND. THE GFS SHOWS A COLD FRONT 
PASSAGE ON SUNDAY WITH A BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN 
CONUS...AND THE ECMWF SHOWING A GENERALLY SIMILAR PATTERN BUT A 
SLOWER FRONT. GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SEEM TO ALL BE SLOWER THAN THE 
OPERATIONAL GFS AND FAVOR THE ECMWF. THUS WILL LEAN TOWARD THE 
SLOWER SOLUTION AND HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP MONDAY.

NORTH OF INTERSTATE 40. BELIEVE CONVECTION IS MOSTLY COMPLETE NORTH
OF THE BOUNDARY BUT THERE COULD BE AN ISOLATED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA UNTIL LATE
EVENING. PLACED SOME MVFR VSBY FOG IN AT ALL THREE TERMINALS AND
EVEN APPLIED AN MVFR CEILING AT TRI AROUND 08-14Z. EXPECT ANOTHER
VFR WEATHER DAY ON SUNDAY. HOWEVER...THE MODELS APPEAR TO BE
PICKING UP ON ANOTHER SHORT WAVE FEATURE DROPPING SOUTHEAST INTO

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGGING 
SOUTH INTO THE AREA IS COMBINING WITH A WEAK UPPER IMPULSE TO BRING 
SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA.  THESE SHOULD DIMINISH 
THIS EVENING...AND EXPECT SOME PATCHY FOG LATE TONIGHT.  WITH

CONVECTION AGAIN...SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON.  MAV TEMPS LOOK A BIT TOO LOW TONIGHT AND TOO HIGH 
SUNDAY...SO WILL BLEND IN SOME OF THE MET TEMPS TO MAKE THE RANGE A 
BIT SMALLER.  

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A DIRTY RIDGE WILL
SUMMARIZE THE WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE UPCOMING WEEK. FLOW OVER THE
TOP OF THE RIDGE WILL PERMIT WEAK DISTURBANCES TO PLAY WITH THE CWA
/ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST HALF/ AND FOCUS CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY...HOWEVER
EVEN WHEN SUCH DISTURBANCES ARE ABSENT...THE WARM AND SORTA HUMID
AIR WILL YIELD ISOLATED CONVECTION MOST AFTERNOONS/EVENINGS. ONLY
AFTER A CLOSED LOW MOVES THROUGH THE AREA /THAT FOR NOW THE

COLD FRONT WILL PUSH IN ON SATURDAY.  WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS EARLY

WORKS IN. NO MAJOR ARGUMENTS WITH MAV TEMPS SO JUST A FEW MINOR 
ADJUSTMENTS.  

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE BEGINNING OF THE

PRESSURE OVER THE AREA WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH AND WEST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL PULL NORTHEAST INTO THE 
REGION FOR MONDAY WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY PRODUCING 
WIDELY SCATTERED TO SCATTERED MAINLY AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
CONVECTION.

FOR TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CONTINUE TO 
DIFFER ON THE AMOUNT OF PHASING BETWEEN A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORT-WAVES. THE ECMWF IS MUCH DIFFERENT FROM YESTERDAY WITH 
A DEFINED SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS TEXAS AND 
NORTHERN GULF AS WELL AS A MUCH DEEPER UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN 
QUARTER OF THE UNITED STATES.  THE GFS AND CANADIAN MODEL ARE CLOSER 
IN AGREEMENT WITH BRINGING SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER LOW ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. WILL FOLLOW THE GFS MODEL BUT WITH LOWER THAN 
AVERAGE CONFIDENCE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXTENDS SE FROM 
W KY ACROSS EAST TN INTO SC. THIS BOUNDARY WILL MOVE NORTH TODAY AS 
A WARM FRONT. DEW POINTS WILL REMAIN HIGH ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE 
FRONT. THE AIRMASS WILL DESTABILIZE WITH DAY TIME HEATING. LOW LEVEL 
THICKNESS VALUES SUPPORT TEMPERATURES WARMER THAN MOS GUIDANCE. THE 
MOS MAY BE ALLUDING TO MORE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER BUT SEE NO REASON 
TO GO A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN THURSDAY. AIRMASS THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
BE POSSIBLE EARLY TODAY AND CONTINUE THIS EVENING AS A SHORT WAVE 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. STAYED ABOVE TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE TONIGHT 
WITH COLD FRONT REMAINING NORTH OF THE AREA. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL LINGER OVER THE MRX CWA ON SATURDAY AS A COLD 
FRONT PULLS AWAY FROM THE REGION.  SHOULD BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND.  CONSISTENCY REMAINS POOR FOR THE REST OF 
THE EXTENDED AND CONFIDENCE IS LOW.  HOWEVER...EXPECT TO MOVE INTO 
AN UNSETTLED PATTEN MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS A SERIES OF 
FRONTS/LOWS TRACK THROUGH THE AREA.  BEST CHANCE FOR CONVECTION WILL 
REMAIN TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT SLIDES THROUGH.  
UPPER LOW MOVES THROUGH FOR WEDNESDAY FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF 
CONVECTION.  HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR THURSDAY.  GUIDANCE LOOKS 
GOOD AND STAYED CLOSE THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.AVIATION...CONVECTION HAS WEAKENED GREATLY FROM MID TO LATE 
AFTERNOON...BUT SOME SPOTTY SHOWERS OR POSSIBLY -TSRA COULD LINGER 
ALONG OR NEAR THE STALLED FRONT. THIS WOULD AFFECT MOSTLY TYS AND  
SOME PATCHY DENSE FOG MAY DEVELOP THERE BEFORE DAYBREAK (DUE TO 
NEARLY 3/4THS OF AN INCH OF RAIN TODAY). TOOK VISBY DOWN TO 4SM BR 
FOR NOW.

ONE MODEL SPREADS SHOWERS NE OVERNIGHT FROM MS/AL...BUT CONFIDENCE 
IS LOW IN THIS ACTUALLY HAPPENING. A MORE SENSIBLE FORECAST IS FOR 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING AGAIN ON FRIDAY IN THE AFTERNOON...TIED MUCH 
TO LOCATION OF STALLED FRONT OR WARM FRONT LIFTING NE. FOR NOW KEPT 
TSRA OUT OF TAFS...CHOOSING CB AND SHOWERS AT BOTH CHA AND TYS.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE 
AREA WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH TONIGHT.  
SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED OVER CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
AREAS NEAR AND SOUTH OF THIS BOUNDARY...AND WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS THROUGH TONIGHT IN THESE SAME AREAS TONIGHT.  MODELS INDICATE 
THE FRONT WILL BEGIN MOVING BACK NORTH FRIDAY AS A WEAK LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM TRAVERSES THE OHIO VALLEY.  MOISTURE WILL INCREASE AND MODELS 
INDICATE A WEAK UPPER IMPULSE MAY BRUSH THE AREA...SO WILL CARRY 
CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES FOR FRIDAY.  NO MAJOR ARGUMENTS WITH MAV 
TEMPS.     

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE EXTENDED PERIOD 
WILL START WILL A QUICK MOVING SHORT-WAVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
INTO THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH 
CHANCE POPS FRIDAY NIGHT AND SLIGHT CHANCE OF SATURDAY. BOUNDARY 
MOVES SOUTH OF THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT BEGINS TO MOVE BACK 
NORTH FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT WITH LOW CHANCE POPS OF CONVECTION.

THE MEDIUM RANGE MODEL SHOWS CONSIDERABLE DISAGREEMENT FOR EARLY TO 
MID PART OF NEXT WEEK. THE ECMWF SHOWS A PHASED NORTHERN STREAM 
DOMINATED TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. 
THE OPERATIONAL GFS SHOWS A SEPARATE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM 
TROUGHS. SINCE THE SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE IS NOT PHASED WITH THE 
NORTHERN WAVE...CONVECTION LASTS CONSIDERABLY LONGER. GFS ENSEMBLE 
SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN THE GFS MEMBERS...SO HAVE 
LOW CONFIDENCE ON HOW SYSTEM WILL EVENTUALLY EVOLVE. WILL TREND MORE 
TOWARD THE MORE PROGRESSIVE ECMWF SOLUTION. WILL CALL FOR DRIER 
WEATHER RETURNING BY WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY CONTINUES 
TO MAKE ITS WAY VERY SLOWLY SOUTH THROUGH SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA EARLY 
THIS MORNING. FRONTAL MOVEMENT IS SLOW ENOUGH THAT IT MAY NOT MAKE 
IT SOUTH OF THE TENNESSEE BORDER AROUND CHATTANOOGA. WITH MODEST 
MOISTURE AND A BIT OF INSTABILITY PROGGED ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE 
MAINTAINED THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM 
GENERALLY SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40. KEPT THE CHANCE GOING THROUGH THE 
EVENING AND ADJUSTED FARTHER NORTH ACROSS A SMALL PART OF THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU NEAR THE KENTUCKY BORDER AS MOISTURE AND LIFT 
WILL BE GRADUALLY INCREASING LATER TONIGHT AS THE OLD FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY LIFTS BACK NORTH IN RESPONSE THE ADVANCE OF THE PLAINS 
STATES UPPER TROUGH. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MAX TEMP GUIDANCE BLEND 
TODAY...PULLING MAX TEMP A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW BLEND AT CHA AS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND ASSOCIATED CLOUDS MOVE INTO THIS AREA DURING 
THE AFTERNOON. TRIED TO GO A COUPLE DEGREES MILDER THAN SUGGESTED 
MIN TEMPS WITH UNCERTAINTY IN JUST HOW FAR SOUTH FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
GETS BEFORE MOVING BACK NORTH.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LOW PRESSURE TRACKING OVER 
THE LOWER GREAT LAKES WILL BRING INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION IN A 
LOW LEVEL SW FLOW ON FRIDAY. PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE RISING THROUGH 
THE DAY AS 500 MB HEIGHTS FALL AND THE MID/UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES 
MORE AMPLIFIED. BEST PRECIP CHANCES APPEAR TO BE IN NORTHERN AREAS 
FRIDAY EVENING WHEN THE UPPER JET BECOMES POSITIONED OVER THE UPPER 
OH VALLEY AND THE 850-700 MB TROUGH PASSAGE OCCURS. INSTABILITY 
LOOKS SUFFICIENT FOR A MARGINAL SEVERE THREAT FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON/EVENING...BUT WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES BARELY OVER 1 
INCH...COVERAGE WILL NOT BE EXTENSIVE. A SLIGHT CHANCE POP WILL 
CONTINUE FOR SOUTHERN AREAS INTO SATURDAY MORNING AS A COLD FRONT 
PUSHES THROUGH. THE NAM SHOWS MUCH COLDER AIR BUILDING IN BEHIND THE 
FRONT THAN THE GFS...WILL LEAN TOWARD THE NAM SOLUTION WHICH HAS 
SUPPORT FROM THE SREF AND CANADIAN. 

AN INCREASINGLY AMPLIFIED RIDGE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST WILL MEAN 
CONTINUED MILD TEMPERATURES AND MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FOR SUNDAY. ONCE 
THE RIDGE AXIS MOVES TO OUR EAST ON MONDAY...MOISTURE ADVECTION 
INCREASES AHEAD OF A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CROSSING THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER IN THEIR DEPICTION OF THIS 
SYSTEM WITH THE GFS SHOWING A SOUTHERN STREAM CLOSED LOW WHILE THE 
ECMWF SHOWS A DEEP OPEN TROUGH...BUT BOTH MODELS POINT TO LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT FOR THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES AND TUESDAY MORNING FOR 
TIMING OF FROPA. BOTH SHOW STRONG JET DYNAMICS GIVING A POTENTIAL 
FOR SEVERE STORMS...BUT ESPECIALLY THE GFS WITH ITS CUT OFF LOW. 
SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER AND MORE SEASONABLE TEMPS WILL FOLLOW THE FRONT 
FOR WEDNESDAY.

THE FRONT. TRI COULD BE AFFECTED BY ONE OF THESE TSRA...BUT CHANCES 
ARE VERY SLIM OF ANY CONVECTION LASTING LONG ENOUGH TO REACH TYS OR

EVEN FOR TRI...KEPT MOSTLY VFR CONDITIONS. SOME GUSTY WINDS ARE 
POSSIBLE REST OF THE EVENING WITH THE CONVECTION. OTHERWISE...VFR 
EXPECTED FROM 29/06Z THROUGH 30/00Z. 

PREVIOUS AFD FOLLOWS...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SAG 
SOUTH INTO THE AREA TONIGHT...THEN STALL IN VICINITY OF OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER.  LOOKS LIKE BEST MOISTURE/INSTABILITY AND LIFT WILL BE 
NORTH...SO WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS NORTH...JUST SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH 
TONIGHT. STILL APPEARS THERE WILL BE SOME THREAT OF SEVERE 
MAINLY NORTH THIS EVENING...SO WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY MENTION IN 
HWO. WITH WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY STILL AROUND THURSDAY WILL CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE EXTENDED 
FORECAST WILL BE DETERMINED BY TWO SHORT-WAVES. FIRST (WEAKER WAVE) 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY FRIDAY. FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...WARM
FRONT WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA PRODUCING 
A CHANCE OF CONVECTION. FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...FAST MOVING 
SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH A TRAILING MOVING 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING. 

RIDGING SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL PRODUCE MOSTLY DRY AND MILD 
CONDITIONS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE 
ACROSS PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT/EARLY TUESDAY 
MORNING. ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE A CONCERN OF SEVERE WEATHER 
LATE MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS IN AGREEMENT WITH 
AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION FOR EARLY-

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SAG 
SOUTH INTO THE AREA TONIGHT...THEN STALL IN VICINITY OF OUR SOUTHERN 
BORDER.  LOOKS LIKE BEST MOISTURE/INSTABILITY AND LIFT WILL BE 
NORTH...SO WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS NORTH...JUST SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH 
TONIGHT. STILL APPEARS THERE WILL BE SOME THREAT OF SEVERE 
MAINLY NORTH THIS EVENING...SO WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY MENTION IN 
HWO. WITH WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY STILL AROUND THURSDAY WILL CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTHERN COUNTIES.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE EXTENDED 
FORECAST WILL BE DETERMINED BY TWO SHORT-WAVES. FIRST (WEAKER WAVE) 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY FRIDAY. FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...WARM
FRONT WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE WESTERN FORECAST AREA PRODUCING 
A CHANCE OF CONVECTION. FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...FAST MOVING 
SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH A TRAILING MOVING 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING. 

RIDGING SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL PRODUCE MOSTLY DRY AND MILD 
CONDITIONS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE 
ACROSS PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT/EARLY TUESDAY 
MORNING. ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE A CONCERN OF SEVERE WEATHER 
LATE MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS IN AGREEMENT WITH 
AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION FOR EARLY-
MID WEEK NEXT WEEK...WHICH WILL USHER IN MUCH COOLER WEATHER.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER TROUGH EDGING EASTWARD 
TOWARD THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES WITH COLD FRONT PRESSING INTO THE 
UPPER MIDWEST EARLY THIS MORNING. SOME CONVECTION ALREADY NOTED JUST 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT ACROSS ILLINOIS. MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD 
ENJOY ANOTHER GREAT DAY COMPLETE WITH WELL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
AS INSOLATION COMPETES WITH SCATTERED TO BROKEN CIRRUS CLOUDS DURING 
THE MORNING. A SOUTHWESTERLY BREEZE WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE REGION 
WHICH WILL HELP TEMPERATURES CLIMB. DURING THE AFTERNOON A LINE OF 
CONVECTION WILL DROP FURTHER SOUTH THROUGH KENTUCKY AS THE MID WEST 
COLD FRONT CONTINUES ITS TREK TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. BY LATE AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME 
LIKELY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. MUCH OF THE STRONGER UPPER LEVEL 
DYNAMICS AND DEEPER MOISTURE WILL SWING EAST THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
ATLANTIC STATES BY EVENING BUT THERE WILL STILL BE A RELATIVELY HIGH 
CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM WEDNESDAY NIGHT MAINLY NORTH OF 
INTERSTATE 40 WITH CHANCES RAPIDLY DECREASING ACROSS SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE 
THAT SOME OF THE CONVECTION THAT BUILDS SOUTH INTO THE NORTHERN HALF 
OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE TODAY AND THIS EVENING MAY BECOME SEVERE 
WITH WEAK INSTABILITY AND SHEAR PROGGED IN THIS AREA. WOULD EXPECT 
CONVECTION TO WEAKEN DURING THE EVENING WITH THE LOSS OF HEATING. 
WENT CLOSE TO THE WARMEST MAX TEMP GUIDANCE TODAY WITH ONLY A THIN 
VEIL OF CIRRUS AND A FEW CU DURING MUCH OF THE DAY WHILE OPTING FOR 
THE MILDER SUGGESTED MIN TEMPS AS THE FRONT AND ASSOCIATED CLOUDS 
SAG SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS APPEAR TO BE TRENDING 
FASTER WITH THE SYSTEM FOR THE END OF THE WEEK...AND POPS WILL BE 
ADJUSTED ACCORDINGLY. THE NAM...GFS...AND SREF SHOW HIGHEST POPS 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN ASSOCIATION WITH A FAST-MOVING 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH. MOISTURE REMAINS FAIRLY LIMITED WITH THIS 
SYSTEM...SO WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE. A DEEP NW FLOW 
DEVELOPS BEHIND THE TROUGH PASSAGE...WHICH SHOULD GIVE DRY 
CONDITIONS FOR SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. A BUILDING RIDGE WILL KEEP 
TEMPS WELL ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

THE GFS AND THE ECMWF BOTH SHOW A WELL-DEFINED FRONT MOVING INTO THE 
AREA MONDAY NIGHT. THIS SHOULD BRING ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS BEGINNING MONDAY AFTERNOON. WITH A ZONAL FLOW 
ALOFT...THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH QUICKLY...SO TUESDAY LOOKS DRY 
ALONG WITH TEMPERATURES CLOSER TO SEASONAL NORMS.

COOLING TONIGHT...HOWEVER TEMPERATURES REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM  (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY 
SHIFT OUT OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT ALLOWING FOR ONE MORE PERIOD OF 
CLEAR AND QUIET CONDITIONS.  AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL SPREAD 
HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY WITH A CHANCE 
OF CONVECTION REACHING INTO MAINLY NORTHERN AREAS DURING THE LATTER 
HALF OF THE AFTERNOON.  MOISTURE REMAINS LIMITED BUT THE AIR MASS 
BECOMES QUITE UNSTABLE FOR A CHANGE OF SOME STRONG...AND POSSIBLY 
SEVERE STORMS LATE IN THE DAY.

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...BEST CONFIDENCE IS THE 
FIRST HALF OF THE LONG TERM...THEN MUCH LOWER CONFIDENCE FROM SUNDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY. GFS SOLUTION FOR THOSE LATER PERIODS IS THE ONLY 
WET ONE...WITH NAM...ECMWF AND CANADIAN ALL SUPPORTING MOSTLY A DRY 
FORECAST. KEPT SOME CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND AFTER 
COORDINATION WITH JKL...KEPT JUST OUR SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY...GOING AGAINST THE INCREASING GFSX MOS POPS. 

THE EARLY PERIODS FEATURE ANOTHER WEAK E-W ORIENTED FRONT THAT DOES 
NOT PUSH THRU...BEFORE LIFTING BACK AS A WARM FRONT ON FRIDAY. A 
POTENTIAL SHORTWAVE AND ANOTHER FRONT MAY PRODUCE A BETTER SWATH OF 
CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION BY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY...BUT FOR NOW 
I KEPT THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY DRY. NUDGED POPS UP TO LIKELY W AND 
HIGH CHANCE E FOR SATURDAY...DUE TO SOME CONSISTENCY AND CONSENSUS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT IS PUSHING INTO THE AREA THIS MORNING AS HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES MOVES SOUTHEAST. THE FRONT NEVER MAKES 
IT ENTIRELY THROUGH THE AREA...AND ITS MAIN IMPACT WILL BE LOWER 
DEWPOINTS IN THE NORTH BEFORE IT DISSIPATES. WITH FULL SUN...HIGHS 
WILL REACH THE UPPER 70S SOUTH TO AROUND 70 NORTH. 

AS THE HIGH SHIFTS OFF THE SOUTH ATLANTIC COAST TONIGHT...A 
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL DEVELOP IN THE LOW LEVELS. HOWEVER THE EAST-WEST 
ORIENTATION OF THE RIDGE AXIS WILL PREVENT A GOOD INFLUX OF GULF 
MOISTURE. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE 
MID ATLANTIC STATES ON WEDNESDAY. ALTHOUGH MOISTURE WILL BE 
LIMITED...GOOD INSTABILITY DEVELOPS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
ALONG WITH A PRE-FRONTAL CONVERGENCE ZONE...GIVING A HIGH CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS NORTH. NAM AND GFS SHOW DIFFERING AMOUNT 
OF INSTABILITY...BUT WITH EVEN THE LESS UNSTABLE GFS SHOWING CAPE 
NEAR 1000 J/KG...SOME SEVERE STORMS MAY BE POSSIBLE...MAINLY IN THE 
NORTH. THE POPS DECREASE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT AND 
INSTABILITY ARE LOST. 

THE END OF THE SHORT TERM PERIOD LOOKS MUCH LIKE THE 
BEGINNING...WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES PUSHING A 
BACKDOOR COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. 
THIS WILL BRING DRIER AIR INTO THE AREA...WITH MILD DAYTIME TEMPS IN 
THE 70S TO LOWER 80S AND COOL OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE UPPER 30S AND 
40S. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS START OUT IN AGREEMENT CLOSING OUT THE END OF MARCH BUT
DIVERGE AS THE NEW MONTH ARRIVES WITH THE 12Z ECMWF A LITTLE SLOW
TO MOVE WEEKEND SHORT WAVE OUT AND LACKS AMPLIFICATION OF WESTERN
STATES UPPER TROUGH WHICH APPEARS TO BE THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER FOR
THE EASTERN U.S. BY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. DID NOT MAKE ANY
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO THE LONG TERM FORECAST WITH HIGHEST POPS FOR
CONVECTION SATURDAY NIGHT WHILE DROPPING BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE ON
SUNDAY AS SHORT WAVE SHIFTS EAST. WITH UNCERTAINTY IN SPEED OF NEXT
SYSTEM MAINTAINED THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS AND

ALLOWING TEMPERATURES FOR FALL INTO THE 40S AT MANY LOCATIONS.  A 
FEW 30S ARE ALSO POSSIBLE AND COULD...THEREFORE SEE A FEW POCKETS OF

SUNSHINE AND WARM TEMPERATURES EXPECTED FOR TUESDAY AS THE HIGH 
CONTINUE TO DOMINATE AREA WEATHER. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THESE PERIODS START OUT 
WITH A WEAKENING UPPER RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION. 
THIS ALLOWS A WEAK E-W FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO GRADUALLY WORK SOUTH 
THROUGH THE SRN APPALACHIANS BY LATE THURSDAY. VERY BRIEF UPPER AND 
SURFACE RIDGING FOR FRIDAY ALLOWS DRY WEATHER FOR A PERIOD OR TWO.

THE OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY LIFTS NE AS THE NEXT WEAK SHORTWAVE 
APPROACHES FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. UPPER LEVELS LOOK A BIT NOISY 
INTO MONDAY WITH SOME TYPE OF LINGERING FRONTAL BOUNDARY POSSIBLE. 

WEAK IS CERTAINLY THE APPROPRIATE TERMINOLOGY WITH ANY OF THE THESE 
SYSTEMS...SO NOT MUCH QPF EXPECTED NOR ANY REAL THREAT OF SEVERE 
WEATHER EITHER. TEMPS WON'T HIT THE 80S FOR HIGHS NOR 30S FOR LOWS
...STAYING MOSTLY 60S AND 70S FOR HIGHS AND LOWS IN THE MID 40S TO

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
LINGERING CLOUD COVER BEHIND A DEPARTING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
MAINLY AFFECT NORTHERN AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THIS 
MORNING. OTHERWISE SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY BY AFTERNOON...WITH 
TEMPERATURES PEAKING IN THE 70S IN MOST SPOTS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS. 

HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WILL SHIFT EAST THROUGH 
THE DAY...MOVING TO ONTARIO BY TONIGHT. THIS WILL PUSH A BACKDOOR 
COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA AFTER 00Z. THE MAIN IMPACT OF THIS FRONT 
WILL BE LOWER DEWPOINTS...WHICH WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO FALL INTO THE 
30S ACROSS THE NORTH. THERE IS UNCERTAINTY REGARDING HOW MUCH WINDS 
WILL STAY UP OVERNIGHT AS THE NAM SHOWS A PRETTY GOOD PRESSURE 
GRADIENT BEHIND THE FRONT...WHICH SHOULD HELP HOLD TEMPS UP ABOVE 
FREEZING. SOME POCKETS OF MID 30S IN SHELTERED VALLEYS OF SW VA AND 
NE TN WILL BE POSSIBLE. IF WINDS GO CALM...COLDER TEMPS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE AND A FROST ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED. CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH 
ENOUGH TO ISSUE ONE THIS FAR IN ADVANCE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE LINGERING OVER
THE REGION BRINGING DRY WEATHER ON TUESDAY. A FRONT TRACKS THROUGH
THE AREA ON LATE WEDNESDAY AND INTO THURSDAY BRINGING A CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR

FRONT ENTERS THE AREA ON SATURDAY FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER FRONT ON
SUNDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR
THE WEEKEND. STAYED NEAR HPC/MEX GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

SEE SOME THUNDERSTORMS AFTER SUNRISE. THUNDERSTORM INTENSITY AND 
SEVERE THREAT SHOULD DECREASE AS STORMS MOVE INTO A LESS UNSTABLE 
REGION. BEHIND THE CONVECTIVE LINE...SATELLITE SHOWS AN AREA OF 
PARTIAL CLEARING...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME SUNSHINE TO BRING 
TEMPS INTO THE LOWER 70S TODAY IN THE VALLEY. LOWER THETA-E AIR WILL 
PUSH INTO THE AREA BEHIND THE FRONT TODAY...WHICH WILL LIMIT 
INSTABILITY AND POTENTIAL FOR THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER WITH COOLING 
MIDLEVEL TEMPS UNDER THE CLOSED LOW...WILL HAVE A CHANCE OF THUNDER 
ALONG WITH LIKELY POPS...AND SOME HAIL CANNOT BE RULED OUT WITH 
STRONGER STORMS. THE UPPER LOW TAKES IT TIME MOVING EAST...AND 
SHOULD BE OVER THE CAROLINAS BY LATE TONIGHT. WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS GOING TONIGHT...BUT TAPERING OFF THROUGH THE NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKING
THROUGH THE AREA PRODUCING SHOWERS TO THE REGION ON SUNDAY AND
SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE NORTHERN AREAS.
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN ON MONDAY BRINGING DRY WEATHER ON MONDAY THROUGH
WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER FRONT ENTERING THE REGION ON THURSDAY BRINGING A
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. STAYED

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW OUT OF THE GULF WILL SUPPLY AMPLE MOISTURE TO 
THE AREA THIS MORNING. A LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ZONE WILL BE THE MAIN 
LIFTING MECHANISM THIS MORNING AND INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON FOR 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. A POTENTIAL LIMITING FACTOR MAY BE 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY NEAR THE GULF COAST THAT MAY CUT OFF THE DEE 
MOISTURE FEED THIS FAR NORTH. STILL...WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS 
TODAY. OVERCAST CLOUD COVER AND LACK OF UPPER LEVEL FORCING WILL 
LIMIT THE THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS. THERE MAY BE JUST ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY FOR A LOW HAIL THREAT.

AS THE CLOSED UPPER LOW TRACKS EAST FROM THE PLAINS TO THE LOWER OH 
VALLEY BY TONIGHT...UPPER LEVEL FORCING WILL CONTRIBUTE TO LIFT WITH 
300 MB DIVERGENCE AND COOLING MIDLEVEL TEMPS. THIS WILL KEEP THE 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS GOING OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER THE 850 MB FLOW TURNS 
MORE SW AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE IS LACKING...SO POPS AND QPF WILL 
LOWER THROUGH THE NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE
TRACKING THROUGH THE REGION BRINGING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO

INCREASE THE VERTICAL WIND PROFILE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN

STORMS. SUFFICIENT SHEAR AND INSTABILITY NOTED...BUT COLD POOL ALOFT 
ARRIVES ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...SUGGESTING A THREAT OF 
DIME TO QUARTER SIZE HAIL WITH SATURDAY'S TSRA. WILL MENTION BOTH 
WIND AND HAIL THREAT FRIDAY AFTERNOON IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER 
OUTLOOK. 

LINGERING CLOUDS AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS INTO SUNDAY...THEN THE NEXT 
UPPER RIDGE BUILDS EAST TO KEEP THE FORECAST DRY THROUGH MID NEXT 
WEEK.

PREVIOUS GRIDS WERE RIGHT ON TRACK. I DID NUDGE POPS UP TO LOW END 
OF LIKELY FOR NE TN AND SW VA BY LATE FRIDAY AFTERNOON...AND ALSO 
SLIGHTLY RAISED POPS IN ERN MOST AREAS FRIDAY NIGHT. NO MORE 80S FOR 
AWHILE...BUT HIGHS CONTINUE ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH 
THE PERIOD. LOWS DROP BACK INTO THE 40S TO MID 50S. MAX/MIN TEMP 
GRIDS WERE CLOSE TO LATEST GFSX MOS (22/00Z) AND MATCHED ADJACENT 
NWS GRIDS.

UPPER LOW IS AIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTION ACROSS SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THE STORMS INITIATE OVER
THE TERRAIN AND DRIFT SOUTHWEST. APPLIED A VICINITY THUNDER AT TRI

A FEW CU ARE DEVELOPING IN THE HEALTHY DOWNSLOPING SOUTHEASTERLY
FLOW CROSSING THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. SUPPOSE THE BEST CHANCE FOR SOME
LIGHT FOG FORMING WILL BE AT TRI TOWARD DAYBREAK. DON'T BELIEVE
THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM AT THE TERMINALS
PRIOR TO 18Z THURSDAY. BUT THE LOW LEVEL ATMOSPHERE WILL GRADUALLY
MOISTEN ON THURSDAY WITH ISOLATED CONVECTION POSSIBLE BEYOND THE

SLOWLY MOVING UPPER LEVEL PATTERN OVER THE SOUTHERN U.S. WITH UPPER
RIDGE STILL HOLDING ON RIGHT NOW OVER UPPER TN VALLEY. STEERING
FLOW LIKELY TO TAKE CONVECTION FROM MOUNTAINS THAT DEVELOPS ALONG
TN/NC STATE LINE INTO THE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON...MUCH LIKE
YESTERDAY...EXCEPT THAT MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT BETTER
CHANCES ARE UP THE CHAIN IN NE TN/SW VA...AND LESS NEAR THE
SMOKIES. SO WILL KEEP THE CENTRAL VALLEY LOCATIONS...LIKE KNOXVILLE
DRY IN THIS FORECAST...BUT WILL WATCH FOR HOW FAR SW ALONG THE MTN
CHAIN THE DEEP CONVECTION DEVELOPS...SINCE ANY OF THIS WILL LIKELY
HEAD WWD OR NWWD INTO THE VALLEY.

OVER THE FAR EAST TO NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.
OTHERWISE...UPPER RIDGING AHEAD OF A DEEP UPPER TROUGH OVER THE

UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS WILL ALSO PREVAIL WITH NEAR RECORD OR

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...RAIN CHANCES ON THE 
INCREASE AS THE UPPER LOW AND COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACH. SHOWERS 
AND STORMS AHEAD OF AND WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...WITH BEST 
COVERAGE LIKELY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. BEST THREAT OF SEVERE 
STORMS SHOULD BE SATURDAY AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS IN THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MAIN THREAT LOOKS TO BE LARGE HAIL AS TEMPS 
COOL ALOFT...AND FREEZING/WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS DROP TO AROUND 8000 
FT ASL.

UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS. FOR FRIDAY...UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN 
WITH INCREASING CHANCE OF CONVECTION AS FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA.
ASSOCIATED UPPER LOW OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES MOVES TOWARD THE 
CENTRAL-SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. 

FOR SATURDAY...INCOMING UPPER TROUGH WITH ASSOCIATED COOLING ALOFT 
WILL COMBINE WITH DAYTIME HEATING TO DESTABILIZE THE AIRMASS TO 
PRODUCE SCATTERED-BROKEN THUNDERSTORMS. DUE TO THE COLD AIR 
ALOFT...SOME OF THESE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LARGE HAIL.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TRANQUIL AND VERY WARM WEATHER
AGAIN TODAY AS SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE HOLD ACROSS THE REGION. KEPT
THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR AN AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORM ALONG THE TN-NC
LINE. LOW LEVEL TO 850 MB FLOW BECOMES LIGHT SE THIS AFTERNOON...
WHICH MAY PROVIDE SOME WEAK CONVERGENCE...SUPPORTING SOME VERY
ISOLATED TSRA. 850 MB TEMPS AND LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES DON'T CHANGE
MUCH FROM YESTERDAY...SO KEPT HIGHS TODAY ONLY A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE
MONDAY MAXES. ONCE AGAIN MAX TEMPS REACH NEAR OR EXCEED RECORD
HIGHS...CHA - 85...TYS - 83...TRI -78 AND OQT - 82.

FAIR AND MILD TONIGHT WITH SOME AMOUNT OF HIGH CLOUDS POSSIBLE...
BUT NO FOG ENOUGH TO MENTION. MOS MINS WERE GENERALLY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER RIDGING WILL REMAIN 
IN CONTROL WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT KEEPING A MOSTLY DRY AND 
UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS. FOR FRIDAY...UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN 
WITH INCREASING CHANCE OF CONVECTION AS FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA.
ASSOCIATED UPPER LOW OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES MOVES TOWARD THE 
CENTRAL-SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY. 

FOR SATURDAY...INCOMING UPPER TROUGH WITH ASSOCIATED COOLING ALOFT 
WILL COMBINE WITH DAYTIME HEATING TO DESTABILIZE THE AIRMASS TO 
PRODUCE SCATTERED-BROKEN THUNDERSTORMS. DUE TO THE COLD AIR 
ALOFT...SOME OF THESE STORMS WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LARGE HAIL.

FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST OF THE AREA 
WITH RIDGING RE-ESTABILISHING ITSELF OVER THE AREA.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED MEX MOS GUIDANCE CLOSELY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO  
THE AREA PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR TONIGHT. SHOULD ALSO SEE ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES AGAIN TONIGHT. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED 
REASONABLE SO STAYED CLOSE. A WEAK TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO TRACK 
THOUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY. MOISTURE IS LIMITED SO CARRIED THE 
SLIGHT CHANCES FOR JUST THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON. 
MORE ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED AGAIN ON TUESDAY...MAY SEE 
NEW RECORDS SET AGAIN. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD...SO HIGHER THAN AVERAGE 
CONFIDENCE IN THE OVERALL PATTERN. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE 
DETAILS...ESPECIALLY HOW MUCH CONVECTION MAY BE ABLE TO DEVELOP 
EARLY IN THE PERIOD UNDER THE RIDGE.  HIGH AMPLITUDE RIDGE OVER THE 
AREA TO START THE PERIOD WILL KEEP THINGS QUITE WARM AND SHOULD  
KEEP CONVECTION MINIMAL.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SOME OF 
THE EASTERN AND NORTHERN HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS BOTH WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY AFTERNOONS...BUT WILL KEEP REMAINDER OF AREA PRECIP FREE.  
UPPER LOW WILL MOVE OUT OF THE PLAINS AND WILL AFFECT THE AREA 
TOWARD THE WEEKEND.  STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT TIMING...BUT WILL 
CARRY CHANCE POPS FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY.  UPPER RIDGE FORECAST TO 
BEGIN BUILDING OVER THE REGION BEHIND THIS SYSTEM...SO WILL GO DRY 
MONDAY.

AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST FOR TODAY ON TRACK...NO CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRIEST OVERNIGHT PERIOD IN
SEVERAL DAYS AS UPPER RIDGE IS BEGINNING TO BUILD EASTWARD INTO
THE REGION. PATCHY FOG IS STILL POSSIBLE THROUGH DAYBREAK...BUT
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND SATELLITE PICS INDICATE NOT VERY
SIGNIFICANT.

19/00Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS WERE STILL MOIST...WITH DAYTIME HEATING AND 
SOME WEAK CONVERGENCE IN THE EASTERN MTNS...WHICH LED ME TO ADD SOME 
VERY LOW POPS FOR THOSE AREAS THIS AFTERNOON. THIS ALSO BLENDS IN 
BETTER WITH NWS GRIDS TO OUR NE AND E. HIGHS TODAY SHOULD REACH NEAR 
RECORD VALUES...CHA - 86...TYS - 82...AND TRI - 81. MAINLY CIRRUS 
CLOUDS AND SOME AREAS OF CUMULUS CLOUDS.

DRY TONIGHT WITH MILD LOWS MOSTLY IN THE 50S. FORECAST SOUNDINGS 
REVEAL A FAIR AMOUNT OF CIRRUS CLOUDS SLIPPING THROUGH THE UPPER 
RIDGE...SO KEPT PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...RIDGING STAYS STRONG
TUESDAY BUT INSTABILITY AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE OVER THE EASTERN
MOUNTAINS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE ENOUGH FOR SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER MOST AREAS WILL BE DRY. LOOKS LIKE NEAR
RECORD OR RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES TUESDAY WITH HIGHS LOWER TO MID
80S. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ACROSS WESTERN STATES CLOSES OFF OVER THE
DESERT SOUTHWEST TUESDAY. MOST OF THE CONCENTRATED SHOWER AND
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL LIKELY STAY OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
PLAINS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. BERMUDA LIKE HIGH OVER THE EASTERN
ATLANTIC WILL STRENGTHEN WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WHICH WILL KEEP A
SOUTHEAST FLOW OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL ALLOW MORE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM
ACTIVITY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...MAINLY IN THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS
WEDNESDAY AND A SLIGHT CHANCE ALL AREAS THURSDAY. HIGHS SHOULD BE
A FEW DEGREES COOLER DUE TO CLOUD COVER. THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MS VALLEY SHOULD
BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE TN VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. SHOWERS

CONTINUE TO SLOWLY DECREASE IN COVERAGE ACROSS NE TN/SW VA. 
AVAILABLE MOISTURE AND AFTERNOON DESTABILIZATION WILL ALLOW FOR 
SCATTERED AFTERNOON CONVECTION FAVORING ELEVATED AREAS. MAX TEMPS IN 
LINE WITH LAMP DATA. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWERS AND SCATTERED STORMS 
CONTINUE TO SPREAD EAST OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...FROM 
INTERSTATE 40 NORTHWARD INTO SW VA. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHEST 
THIS MORNING PRIOR TO 12Z...WITH GRIDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THIS. 
POPS WILL DROP OFF FROM THE WEST AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE TAKES 
THE SHOWERS/STORMS EAST...BUT I DID KEEP LIKELY POPS FOR EXTREME NE 
TN (TRI) AND SW VA BEYOND 12Z TODAY.

GRIDS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT WITH JUST SLIGHT TO CHANCE POPS A FEW 
AREAS THIS EVENING. DECREASING CLOUDS COULD LEAD TO PATCHY DENSE 
FOG...WHICH WAS ALSO IN PREVIOUS GRIDS. FOR TEMPS...POTENTIAL TO 
REACH CLOSER TO THE MOS MAXES FOR TODAY...ESPECIALLY WITH SUNSHINE 
BY LATE MORNING OR EARLY AFTERNOON. THUS...STAYED CLOSE TO SIMILAR 
MOS HIGHS. MINS TONIGHT WERE REASONABLE...BUT POSSIBLY A TAD COOL 
GIVEN SPRING TYPE AIR MASS AND DEW POINT TEMPS...SO KEPT MINS A 
DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE GUIDANCE. 

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING NOSES UP 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY WITH A DEEP TROUGH ACROSS THE WEST 
BUT MOVING INTO THE PLAINS STATES. THIS SHOULD SHUT OFF THE 
PRECIPITATION WITH SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES SOUTH AND SEVERAL 
DEGREES NORTH. AIR MASS WILL BE DRIER AS WELL WITH LESS CLOUD COVER. 
MAIN SURFACE HIGH WILL BE OVER THE EASTERN ATLANTIC AND SOUTHEAST 
FLOW ON EAST SIDE OF APPALACHIANS WILL LIKELY TRIGGER A FEW SHOWERS 
OVER THE NORTH CAROLINA MOUNTAINS. MONDAY NIGHT SKIES SHOULD BECOME 
MOSTLY CLEAR WITH TEMPERATURES STILL VERY MILD. TUESDAY RIDGING 
STILL ABOUT THE SAME. MODELS TRY TO DEVELOP SHOWERS OVER THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING BUT WITH UPPER LOW LIKELY TO 
CLOSE OFF ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THIS SHOULD SLOW THE EAST WARD 
PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM. WILL KEEP TUESDAY DRY AND WITH VERY WARM 
TEMPERATURES LIKE MONDAY. WEDNESDAY MOISTURE INCREASES A BIT MORE SO 
WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE 
PLATEAU AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS. THURSDAY THE PLAINS AND MS VALLEY 
SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE TN VALLEY. HIGHER POPS THURSDAY BUT THERE ARE 
SOME INDICATIONS THAT THE SYSTEM IS SLOWING SO POPS MAY HAVE TO BE 
ADJUSTED DOWN IN NEXT MODEL RUNS. AIR MASS BECOMES MORE UNSTABLE 
WITH THUNDERSTORMS PROBABLE. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AS COLD FRONT PASSES THROUGH WITH WRAP AROUND 
MOISTURE WITH WOUND UP UPPER LOW SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT WILL 
ALLOW MORE SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY COOL BUT STILL BE ABOVE NORMAL 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

.AVIATION...ORGANIZED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED TSRA CONTINUE TO MOVE 
EASTWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...BUT WILL JUST 
AFFECT TRI THROUGH ABOUT 15Z. INTENSITY HAS BEEN DECREASING AND 
LIGHTNING DIMINISHING...SO EXPECT JUST BRIEFLY MARGINAL MVFR AT TRI. 
VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR TYS AND CHA...AND I OPTED FOR VCSH WITH 
CB WORDING FOR REST OF TODAY AND THIS EVENING...AS CONVECTION LATER 
TODAY SHOULD BE MUCH MORE RANDOM. 

LATE TONIGHT...AFTER 19/06Z...WITH CLEARING SKIES PATCHY FOG IS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWERS AND SCATTERED STORMS 
CONTINUE TO SPREAD EAST OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...FROM 
INTERSTATE 40 NORTHWARD INTO SW VA. RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHEST 
THIS MORNING PRIOR TO 12Z...WITH GRIDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THIS.
POPS WILL DROP OFF FROM THE WEST AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE 
TAKES THE SHOWERS/STORMS EAST...BUT I DID KEEP LIKELY POPS FOR 
EXTREME NE TN (TRI) AND SW VA BEYOND 12Z TODAY.

GRIDS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT WITH JUST SLIGHT TO CHANCE POPS A FEW 
AREAS THIS EVENING. DECREASING CLOUDS COULD LEAD TO PATCHY DENSE 
FOG...WHICH WAS ALSO IN PREVIOUS GRIDS. FOR TEMPS...POTENTIAL TO 
REACH CLOSER TO THE MOS MAXES FOR TODAY...ESPECIALLY WITH SUNSHINE 
BY LATE MORNING OR EARLY AFTERNOON. THUS...STAYED CLOSE TO SIMILAR 
MOS HIGHS. MINS TONIGHT WERE REASONABLE...BUT POSSIBLY A TAD COOL 
GIVEN SPRING TYPE AIR MASS AND DEW POINT TEMPS...SO KEPT MINS A 
DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE GUIDANCE. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING NOSES UP
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY WITH A DEEP TROUGH ACROSS THE WEST
BUT MOVING INTO THE PLAINS STATES. THIS SHOULD SHUT OFF THE
PRECIPITATION WITH SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES SOUTH AND SEVERAL
DEGREES NORTH. AIR MASS WILL BE DRIER AS WELL WITH LESS CLOUD
COVER. MAIN SURFACE HIGH WILL BE OVER THE EASTERN ATLANTIC AND
SOUTHEAST FLOW ON EAST SIDE OF APPALACHIANS WILL LIKELY TRIGGER
A FEW SHOWERS OVER THE NORTH CAROLINA MOUNTAINS. MONDAY NIGHT SKIES
SHOULD BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR WITH TEMPERATURES STILL VERY MILD.
TUESDAY RIDGING STILL ABOUT THE SAME. MODELS TRY TO DEVELOP SHOWERS
OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING BUT WITH
UPPER LOW LIKELY TO CLOSE OFF ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THIS
SHOULD SLOW THE EAST WARD PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM. WILL KEEP TUESDAY
DRY AND WITH VERY WARM TEMPERATURES LIKE MONDAY. WEDNESDAY MOISTURE
INCREASES A BIT MORE SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS IN THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE PLATEAU AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS. THURSDAY
THE PLAINS AND MS VALLEY SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE TN VALLEY. HIGHER
POPS THURSDAY BUT THERE ARE SOME INDICATIONS THAT THE SYSTEM IS
SLOWING SO POPS MAY HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED DOWN IN NEXT MODEL RUNS. AIR
MASS BECOMES MORE UNSTABLE WITH THUNDERSTORMS PROBABLE. BEST CHANCE
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AS COLD FRONT PASSES THROUGH
WITH WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WITH WOUND UP UPPER LOW SATURDAY AND
SATURDAY NIGHT WILL ALLOW MORE SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY COOL BUT
STILL BE ABOVE NORMAL FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ONGOING CONVECTION OVER NE AL AND 
NW GA CONTINUES TO AFFECT A SMALL PART OF EXTREME SE TN. ELSEWHERE
PATCHY AREAS OF FOG WERE NOTED UNDER PASSING MOSTLY MID DECK CLOUDS. 
THESE CLOUDS HAVE LIMITED THE FOG FROM BECOMING DENSE AND MORE 
WIDESPREAD. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE PICS HINT AT A WEAK IMPULSE OVER 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS AREA...WHILE 17/00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW A 
POSSIBLE SPEED MAX TO APPROACH LATER TODAY. SHORT RANGE MODELS SHOW 
SCATTERED OR GREATER COVERAGE OF TSRA DEVELOPING AGAIN TODAY...IN AN 
AIR MASS REALLY UNCHANGED FROM YESTERDAY. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS 
WITH A FEW AREAS OF LIKELY POPS TO HIGH CHANCE LOOKED ON TRACK. I 
EXPECT A FEW STRONG STORMS WITH MAIN THREATS LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS AND 
DIME SIZE OR SMALLER HAIL AGAIN.

WILL GO WITH A MOS BLEND OR CLOSER TO COOLER NAM MOS FOR HIGHS TODAY 
...WHICH WORKED OUT WELL FRIDAY. CONVECTION LOOKS TO BE DIMINISHING 
AGAIN TONIGHT AFTER LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...AND THIS WAS THE TREND 
IN PREVIOUS POP/WEATHER GRIDS. STAYED CLOSER TO MILDER MINS ALREADY 
IN GRIDS FOR MINS TONIGHT...GIVEN THE MOIST AIR MASS. PATCHY FOG A 
GOOD BET AGAIN.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER AIR PATTERN BEGINS TO
CHANGE SUNDAY AS RIDGING BEGINS TO STRENGTHEN FROM SOUTH TO NORTH
AND FROM WEST TO EAST. SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING FROM THE OHIO
VALLEY TO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS WILL KEEP A BETTER CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER NE SECTIONS. RISING THICKNESSES
SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM BACK INTO
THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S AT LOWER ELEVATION SITES. CLOUD COVER
SUNDAY MAY AFFECT HIGHS SOMEWHAT BUT WILL GO CLOSE TO MET NUMBERS.
SUNDAY NIGHT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD DECREASE MORE QUICKLY
THAN TONIGHT WITH NE AND EASTERN SECTIONS ONLY HAVING ISOLATED
CONVECTION IN THE EVENING. MONDAY AND TUESDAY RIDGING IS STRONGEST
WITH SUBSIDENCE HELPING CONVECTION TO BE SUPPRESSED. EASTERLY FLOW
AROUND HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG EAST COAST WILL ALLOW ACTIVITY
JUST TO THE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. INTRODUCED POPS WEDNESDAY
MAINLY PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS AS FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO LOWER MS
AND TN VALLEYS AND MOISTURE INCREASES ACROSS FORECAST AREA. THIS
SYSTEM WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST THURSDAY AND BY FRIDAY MORNING MOVE
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE ABOVE
NORMAL WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY BUT A FEW DEGREES COOLER AS RIDGE
BEGINS TO WEAKEN WITH INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES.

1100 AM EDT FRI MAR 16 2012

.DISCUSSION...WEAKENING CONVECTION TO THE WEST THIS MORNING. THIS 
WILL LEAVE A DIFFERENTIAL HEATING BOUNDARY WHICH SHOULD INITIATE 
ADDITIONAL CONVECTION ACROSS EAST TN VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON. 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT AND DESTABILIZATION FROM HEATING WILL ALSO HELP
CONVECTIVE INITIATION. RAISED AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES 2 TO 3 DEGREES 
WHICH WILL CHALLENGE RECORDS AT CHA/TYS/OQT. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONVECTION PRETTY SPARSE THIS 
MORNING...BUT AIR MASS REMAINS MOIST AND APPEARS TO BE OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES AROUND TO HELP INITIATE SHRA OR TSRA RATHER EARLY TODAY. 
KEEPING POPS BUILDING BACK UP TO LIKELY LOOKS VERY REASONABLE. WIND  
FIELDS SHOW LITTLE WIND SHEAR...BUT INSTABILITY IS AT LEAST SLIGHT 
TO MODERATE. ALSO...FREEZING LEVEL AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS ARE 
FAVORABLE FOR MORE SMALL HAIL AGAIN TODAY. CLOUDS AND EARLY START TO 
MORE CONVECTION SUPPORT A BLEND OF MOS FOR HIGHS...PERHAPS A BIT 
CLOSER TO THE MILDER GFS. FORECASTED HIGHS ARE ABOUT 2 TO 3 DEGREES 
BELOW RECORD HIGHS FOR MAR 16TH...CHA - 83...TYS - 81...TRI - 82 AND 
OQT - 79.

EVENING CONVECTION LOOKS TO DISSIPATE GRADUALLY AGAIN TONIGHT...SO 
KEPT CHANCE POPS WITH AREAL QUALIFIER IN THE EVENING THEN TAPERED 
POPS BACK SLIGHTLY AFTER 17/06Z. SUSPECT THAT MILDER MOS MINS ARE 
BEST CHOICE. 

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING 
CONTINUES THROUGH THE WEEKEND BUT SMALL SCALE SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
MOVING THROUGH THE FLAT RIDGING WILL CONTRIBUTE TO CONVECTION BOTH 
DAYS ESPECIALLY IN THE TERRAIN AREAS. HAVE CONTINUED LIKELY POPS 
ACROSS THE TERRAIN AREAS SATURDAY AND CHANCE IN THE VALLEYS. 
DECREASING AT NIGHT AS CONVECTION WILL BE DIURNAL IN NATURE. THE 
RIDGE WILL BUILD A LITTLE MORE SUNDAY. MAV/MET POP GUIDANCE STILL 
LIKELY BUT KEEPING TREND LOWER IN THE CHANCE RANGE. FOLLOWING 
UNUSUAL HIGHER TEMPERATURE TREND WITH HIGHS MUCH ABOVE NORMAL IN THE 
UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY 
RIDGE BUILDS EVEN MORE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST AND TN VALLEY. LOW POPS 
SUNDAY EVENING THEN DRY FORECAST MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WEAK UPPER 
LOW OR WEAKNESS IN RIDGE WILL ALLOW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS JUST 
TO THE NE AND EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS ANY SHIFT IN THIS FEATURE THOUGH 
MAY BRING MORE SHOWERS INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THURSDAY A DEVELOPING 
UPPER LOW OVER THE PLAINS AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM SPREAD

AGREEMENT WITH THIS PATTERN...SO FORECAST CONFIDENCE IN THIS 
SCENARIO IS ABOVE AVERAGE.  CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE OVER THE REGION

.AVIATION...SPOTTY SHOWERS HANGING ON IN THE LAST BIT OF HEAT ACROSS 
EXTREME SE KY AND SW VA...BUT SHOULD DISSIPATE SHORTLY. THIS SHOULD 
LEAVE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES UNTIL LOWER CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG FORM 
AFTER 06Z WEDNESDAY. PREVIOUS TAFS REFLECT THE EXPECTED FOG AND 
CLOUDS...ALTHO I THINK IT IS VERY POSSIBLE FOR A LOWER CEILING TO 
DEVELOP AT TRI. VFR CONDITIONS RETURN AROUND 15Z WEDNESDAY WITH 
LIGHT WINDS.

PREVIOUS AFD...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SHOWERS HAVE ENDED 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY AREA WIDE. 
TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED CONSIDERABLY WEST AND SOUTH BUT SLOWLY NE 
AND MOUNTAINS AS CLOUD COVER HELD ON LONGER. A WEAK FRONT LIES OVER 
THE OHIO VALLEY AND IS EXPECTED TO MOVE CLOSER TO THE FORECAST AREA 
OVERNIGHT BUT RIDGING ALOFT WILL KEEP IT TO THE NORTH. NAM AND RUC 
MODELS TRY TO DEVELOP SHOWERS OVERNIGHT IN THE NE AS THERE IS SOME 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND GFS MODEL KEEPS AREA DRY AFTER 00Z TONIGHT.
WILL KEEP TONIGHTS FORECAST DRY. LEFT OVER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND 
LIGHT WINDS WILL ALSO ALLOW SOME SHALLOW FOG FORMATION. OVERALL 
MOSTLY FAIR CONDITIONS WITH TEMPERATURES ONLY FALLING TO THE UPPER 
40S TO LOWER 50S TONIGHT AND HIGHS WEDNESDAY IN THE 70S TO NEAR 80 
AT CHATTANOOGA. MAY APPROACH THE RECORD OF 78 AT TRI SET IN 1990. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...OUR BUSY PATTERN 
OVER THE LAST FEW WEEKS HAS SLOWED DOWN AS OUR CURRENT ZONAL FLOW 
GIVES WAY TO AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE THAT BUILDS IN THE LATTER PERIODS 
AS THE LARGE TROUGH TAKES OVER IN THE SOUTHWEST U.S.

AT THE SURFACE, WE SHOULD KEEP A SOUTHERLY COMPONENT THROUGH THESE 
TIME PERIODS. HOWEVER...EVEN THOUGH THE PATTERN SEEMS QUIET WE DO GET
INTO A SUMMER PATTERN WITH AVAILABLE MOISTURE TO SUPPORT SOME
DIURNAL SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. AS THE RIDGE BUILDS
STRONGER IN LATER PERIODS...THE POPS WIND DOWN. TEMPERATURES SHOULD
BE ABOVE AVERAGE THE ENTIRE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHEAST
STATES WHILE A MOIST FLOW AROUND THE HIGH CONTINUES TO BRING
MOISTURE NORTH INTO THE GULF STATES AND TN VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON.
SKIES REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY TO CLOUDY. AN UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO
MOVE NE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TOWARD ONTARIO. LIGHT SHOWERS ARE
CONTINUING IN A FEW SPOTS OVER EAST TN AND SW VA OTHERWISE THERE
HAS BEEN FAR LESS COVERAGE OF SHOWERS TO THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST.
CURRENT MODEL PROGS SHOW MORE SHOWER AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS
TONIGHT BUT CLOSEST ACTIVITY LIES OVER LAKE MICHIGAN AND SOUTHERN
LA. HAVE A SOMEWHAT PESSIMISTIC FORECAST WHICH IS CLOSER TO MET
GUIDANCE OF 30 PERCENT NORTH TO 50 PERCENT SOUTH OF SHOWERS. KEPT
THUNDER WORDING IN FORECAST BUT INSTABILITY HAS BEEN LIMITED DUE TO
CLOUD COVER. AFTER 3Z MOISTURE SHIFTS EAST SO MOST LIKELY POPS WILL
DROP TO NIL. HAVE CHANCE POPS MOST AREAS FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT.
DRIER AIR MASS WORKS IN AS RIDGE STRENGTHENS TUESDAY. AIR MASS
BECOMES MODERATELY UNSTABLE BY AFTERNOON SO STILL THINK A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE BUT ONLY OVER THE MOUNTAINS.
TEMPERATURES MUCH WARMER IN THE 70S.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGING WILL DOMINATE THE FORECAST THROUGH
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A DRY AIR MASS ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS PRODUCING DRY CONDITIONS AND UNSEASONABLY
WARM AFTERNOONS.

A WEAK SHORT-WAVE WILL RIDE OVER THE UPPER RIDGE LATE THURSDAY 
THROUGH FRIDAY INCREASING THE CHANCE OF CONVECTION AND CLOUDS. 
AT THIS TIME...MODELS SHOW MARGINAL INSTABILITY...BUT ENOUGH FOR 
INCLUSION OF THUNDERSTORMS.

WEAK UPPER RIDGE OF PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY TO CONTINUE 
WITH CHANCE OF MAINLY AFTERNOON/EVENING THUNDERSTORMS FOR SATURDAY. 
BEST CHANCE WILL BE ACROSS THE HIGH TERRAIN.

STRENGTHENING UPPER RIDGE AND BEST MOISTURE CONVERGENCE LOCATED EAST 
OF THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...SO WILL LOWER POPS SUNDAY.  FOR

.DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE IS CENTERED OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST OF
THE US WITH UPPER LEVEL RIDGE ALONG THE SOUTHEAST COAST. AN UPPER
LOW WAS OVER IOWA. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WAS LOCATED ACROSS THE
UPPER MIDWEST. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE HAS INCREASED OVER MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA. WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY HAS MOVED INTO THE LOWER
MS...OHIO AND TN VALLEYS AND WAS TRIGGERING SHOWERS OVER WESTERN
KY AND NORTHERN MIDDLE TN LATE THIS MORNING. ONLY A FEW SPRINKLES
HAVE DEVELOPED OVER THE FORECAST AREA THE PAST FEW HOURS. FOR THE
REST OF THE DAY SHORT RANGE MODELS TRY TO BRING SEVERAL WEAK
VORTICITY MAXES ACROSS EAST TN AND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS
AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING. THE BEST INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE
SHOULD STAY ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF TN SO THAT AREA LOOKS MORE
CONDUCIVE TO THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. OVER FORECAST AREA
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S AT THIS HOUR AND DEW
POINTS ARE MOSTLY IN THE 40S WITH 50S SOUTHWEST. CLOUDS WILL LIMIT
TEMPERATURES FROM RISING MUCH PAST THE MID TO UPPER 60S. ADJUSTED
WORDING IN FORECAST FOR SHOWERS TO MID TO LATE AFTERNOON AND KEPT
POPS AROUND 60 PERCENT. NOT REAL CONFIDENT OF ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT
UNTIL LATE IN THE DAY. CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OVER NORTH MS AND
WESTERN AL THOUGH MAY BECOME STRONG AND MOVE TOWARDS SOUTHEAST TN
BY LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LOW WILL LIFT OUT OF THE 
PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES TODAY. SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING 
AROUND THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH OUR AREA.  FORCING LOOKS WEAK 
FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD...BUT CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE WILL COMBINE 
WITH THE WEAK FORCING TO BRING SOME SHOWERS TO THE AREA.  
INSTABILITY WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE...SO MAY BE SOME THUNDER THIS 
AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS TODAY...HIGH CHANCE 
TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST SOME MINOR 
TWEAKS.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY SLIPS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE MORNING ON TUESDAY WITH SOME 
DRYING NOTED BY AFTERNOON. SUPPOSE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP NOT A BAD 
IDEA WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A VERY WEAK SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY HANGING 
AROUND THE AREA. NICE RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE EASTERN STATES TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND WAS ABLE TO SLIGHTLY EXTEND THE DRY 
FORECAST THROUGH THIS PERIOD. BY THURSDAY SOME MOISTENING OCCURS ON 
WARM SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AND MODELS FEATURE SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY RIDING NORTHEAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ACROSS THE OHIO AND 
TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION SO HELD ONTO CHANCE POPS MAINLY ON THE 
PLATEAU FOR THURSDAY WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE MUCH OF THE REMAINDER 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS SEEM TO AGREE ON PASSAGE OF A SLIGHTLY 
STRONGER SHORT WAVE TROUGH FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT SO ADVANCED POPS 
INTO MEDIUM CHANCE RANGE ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION DURING THIS TIME 
PERIOD. TRIED TO DOWNPLAY POPS AS MUCH AS POSSIBLE OVER THE WEEKEND 
GENERALLY FAVORING THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES AS THE UPPER PATTERN 
BECOMES A BIT MORE AMPLIFIED WITH RISING HEIGHTS OVER THE EASTERN 
THIRD OF THE NATION ALONG WITH A NICE 85H RIDGE HOLDING STRONG OR 
EVEN STRENGTHENING TO SOME DEGREE HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND. THIS 
PATTERN WOULD KEEP THE DEEPER INFLUX OF MOISTURE OFF THE GULF 
SUPPRESSED FARTHER WEST OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LIMITING AREAL 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. IN THE WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS EXPECTED THIS 
WEEK THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEFINITELY BE POSSIBLE AND MAINTAINED 
CONVECTION DURING THE DAYTIME PERIODS WITH SHOWERS AT NIGHT WITH THE 
EXCEPTION OF FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT WHEN STRONGER UPPER LEVEL 
FEATURE PASSES ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. MOS GUIDANCE HAS HAD A 
DIFFICULT TIME PREDICTING MAX TEMPERATURE THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS AND 
DOES NOT SEEM TO UNDERSTAND THAT SPRING HAS SPRUNG EARLIER THAN 
USUAL THIS YEAR. WITH THIS IN MIND AND THE PREVAILING SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW PATTERN EXPECTED THIS WEEK...ADJUSTED BOTH MAX AND MIN 
TEMPERATURES A LITTLE HIGHER THROUGH THE LONG TERM FORECAST.

WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT FURTHER AWAY FROM THE REGION.  A WEAKENING 
AND SLOW MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH FROM THE WEST LATE 
TONIGHT...AND SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW TO OUR 
WEST AND NORTHWEST WILL SWING INTO THE AREA.  CLOUDS WILL INCREASE 
AS MOISTURE INCREASES AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...AND SHOWERS SHOULD MOVE 
INTO SOUTHWEST ZONES BY MIDNIGHT AND MAY REACH NORTHEAST ZONES 
BEFORE DAYBREAK.  WILL CARRY CAT POPS TONIGHT SOUTHWEST AND WEST 
ZONES...WITH JUST CHANCE POPS NORTHEAST ZONES.  MAV TEMPS LOOK 
REASONABLE FOR TODAY...BUT WILL GENERALLY GO A BIT HIGHER THAN MAV 
NUMBERS FOR LOWS TONIGHT GIVEN EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP 
MOVING IN.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER TROUGH PRESSES 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON MONDAY AND THEN SHIFTS EAST 
ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN CANADA AND THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. ON TUESDAY. 
NICE INFLUX OF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO. LIFT FROM THE 
ADVANCING TROUGH AND MOISTURE CONVERGENCE SHOULD LEAD TO SHOWERS ON 
MONDAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. CONFIDENCE HIGH ENOUGH TO BOOST 
POPS TO CATEGORICAL RANGE MOST AREAS ON MONDAY. SEVERAL MODELS 
CONTINUE TO DRAG A WEAKER SHORT WAVE FEATURE AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY SO KEPT GOOD CHANCE 
POPS GOING MONDAY NIGHT REDUCING TO CHANCE CATEGORY ON TUESDAY AS 
DRIER AIR EVENTUALLY BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST ALLOWING FOR A DRY 
TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MODELS STILL GENERALLY AGREE THAT 
THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BECOME SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE DUE TO A LENGTHY PERIOD 
OF MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW COMPLETE WITH STRENGTHENING MID MARCH 
INSOLATION DURING THE PERIOD THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. ADDING IN A 
COUPLE SHORT WAVE FEATURES IN THE PREVAILING SOUTHWEST FLOW REQUIRES 
THE USE OF A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR DAYTIME CONVECTION WITH A SHOWER 
OR TWO AT NIGHT. PERHAPS THE BEST CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM WOULD BE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY AS MODEL 
FORECASTS KEY IN ON A SHORT WAVE THAT MIGRATES FROM THE MID 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY NORTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. STAYED FAIRLY 
CLOSE TO MOS GUIDANCE TEMP BLEND THROUGH TUESDAY AND THEN TWEAKED 
MEX MOS TEMPS A LITTLE HIGHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD DUE TO

300 AM EST SAT MAR 10 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR 
NORTH WILL SHIFT SOUTHEAST DURING THE PERIOD...WITH A DRY AIRMASS 
OVER OUR AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD.  MAY SEE A FEW HIGH CLOUDS MAINLY 
LATER TONIGHT. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST A FEW 
MINOR TWEAKS.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK 
STARTS OUT WITH SOME DECENT WEATHER AS AN UPPER RIDGE MIGRATES 
ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL BE ON THE INCREASE 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS A CLOSED UPPER LOW SHIFTS NORTHEAST FROM 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TO THE GREAT LAKES. THIS FEATURE WILL PULL A 
COLD FRONT TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON MONDAY. STILL 
NOT CONVINCED OF THIS SYSTEM'S ABILITY TO GENERATE WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. BEST CHANCE WOULD BE OVER WESTERN 
SECTIONS AND APPLIED GOOD CHANCE THROUGH LIKELY POPS MAINLY ON THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ON MONDAY AFTERNOON WITH LOW TO MEDIUM CHANCE 
ELSEWHERE AND THEN SPREAD GOOD CHANCE POPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION 
MONDAY NIGHT AS A FEW SHOWERS LIMP INTO THE REGION. ASSUMING A WEAK 
BOUNDARY AND MOIST AXIS HAS SHIFTED EAST TO THE MOUNTAINS ON TUESDAY 
KEPT A LOW CHANCE POP AND SLIGHT CHANCE POP ELSEWHERE FOR A SHOWER 
OR THUNDERSTORM ON TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY HEIGHTS START TO BUILD 
AGAIN ALOFT WITH A NICE BERMUDA SURFACE HIGH WEDGING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. PUSHING ANY LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN WELL WEST 
ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. BY THURSDAY MODELS START TO MOISTEN 
UP THE LOW LEVELS A BIT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A WEAK IMPULSE 
DRIFTING EAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. AS THE WARM SOUTHERLY FLOW GETS 
GOING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BECOME 
SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE SO KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE FORECAST ON THURSDAY INCREASING TO LOW CHANCE 
BY THURSDAY NIGHT AS IMPULSE CONTINUES EAST. MAINTAINED A LOW CHANCE 
PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION ON FRIDAY AS WELL IN THE SLIGHTLY 
UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WHICH WILL BE IN PLACE TOWARD THE END OF THE 
WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PRECIP QUICKLY EXITING BEHIND COLD 
FRONT...SO SHOULD BE DRY FOR THE SHORT TERM.  HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BUILD IN ALONG WITH MUCH DRIER AIR. CLOUDS WILL DECREASE 
TODAY...THEN EXPECT MAINLY CLEAR CONDITIONS TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS LOOK 
REASONABLE SO NO BIG ADJUSTMENTS.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST 
LOOKS MORE LIKE LATE APRIL RATHER THAN EARLY MARCH AS HEIGHTS BUILD 
OVER MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE NATION BY THURSDAY. MUCH 
OF THE TIME THE PREVAILING UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BE SOUTHWESTERLY 
PULLING INITIALLY MILD AND THEN WARM AIR INTO THE REGION. THE 
WEEKEND LOOKS RATHER DECENT AS AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS 
THE EASTERN U.S. SUNDAY SHOULD REMAIN DRY BUT THE CHANCE FOR A 
SHOWER WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS A TROUGH 
SWINGS NORTHEAST FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES. 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE WILL INCREASE AHEAD OF A WEAKENING FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WHICH WILL MAKE BETTER PROGRESS ACROSS THE MIDWEST THAN THE 
MID SOUTH. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN HOW FAR EAST THIS BOUNDARY MAY 
PROGRESS MAINTAINED MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS MONDAY INTO 
MONDAY NIGHT. TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY DEFINITELY STARTS LOOKING 
MORE LIKE THE MIDDLE OF SPRING WITH THE MAIN STORM TRACK SHIFTED 
NORTH AND WEST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. THE MODELS HINT 
AT THE POSSIBILITY OF A COUPLE WEAK SHORT WAVE PASSAGES THROUGH THIS 
PERIOD WITH SOME INSTABILITY NOTED IN THE WARMER...HIGHER DEWPOINT 
AIRMASS OFF THE GULF BUT NOTHING TO REALLY KEY IN ON. THEREFORE 
STAYED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION THROUGH THURSDAY. WENT 
A LITTLE ABOVE MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE IN THIS MILD PATTERN.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLE 
MODELS BRING A QUIET PATTERN BACK TO THE REGION THROUGH THE WEEKEND 
AND THEN INCREASE MOISTURE AND WARMTH AS RIDGING HOLDS OVER THE

VALLEYS MONDAY AND THEN SHIFT NORTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY. 
AIR MASS WILL ALSO BECOME SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE EACH AFTERNOON FROM 
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. MODELS SHOW SEVERAL UPPER LEVEL IMPULSES 
MOVING NE FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES. SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP WITH THESE 
FEATURES. A COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NW ON DAY SEVEN 
POSSIBLY WITH THE CHANCE OF THUNDERS. TEMPERATURES WARM INTO THE 70S 
AS DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA 
BRINGS UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPS NEXT WEEK.

A FAVORABLE POSITION FOR UPPER DIVERGENCE. THE GFS IS FASTER TO 
BRING PRECIP INTO THE AREA THAN THE NAM. THE TIMING OF THE SREF AND 
CANADIAN ARE BETWEEN THE TWO AND WILL BE FOLLOWED...WITH CHANCE POPS 
COMING IN AFTER 18Z...WITH LIKELY POPS AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS ARRIVING IN THE PLATEAU AFTER 21Z. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL 
PUSH THROUGH THE MRX CWA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.  DEEP MOISTURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT MAY GENERATE AREAS OF HEAVY RAINFALL.  
ADDITIONALLY...THE AIR MASS WILL BECOME WEAKLY UNSTABLE FOR A FEW 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS.  MODEL CONSISTENCY QUITE POOR FOR THE REST 
OF THE EXTENDED AND CONFIDENCE IS LOW.  CURRENT TRENDS BRING A 
SURFACE HIGH INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY FOR DRY CONDITIONS.  THE NEXT 
SYSTEM MOVES IN SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WHICH SHOULD SPREAD SHOWERS AND 
POSSIBLY A STRAY THUNDERSTORM INTO THE AREA.  SCATTERED SHOWERS 
SHOULD LINGER INTO TUESDAY AS THE SYSTEM EXITS.  WILL KEEP THINGS 
DRY FOR WEDNESDAY WITH WEAK RIDGING EXPECTED OVER THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE REGION 
PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR TODAY. WILL SEE HIGH CLOUDINESS TODAY BUT
SHOULD HAVE PLENTY OF DAYTIME HEATING. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABOVE
NORMAL AGAIN TODAY. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE...SO

WILL KEEP TONIGHT DRY. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURE FOR TONIGHT LOOK
REASONABLE AGAIN SO STAYED CLOSE AGAIN.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK.
A SLOW-MOVING COLD FRONT WILL DRIFT ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY
THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH SHOWERS DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA AS
EARLY AS THURSDAY AFTERNOON. MODELS REMAIN CONSISTENT WITH
INDICATING A GOOD FETCH OF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO WITH
THIS COLD FRONT... WHICH MAY RESULT IN HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE
FORECAST AREA. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A FAIRLY STABLE AIR MASS OVER
THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...EXCEPT ACROSS SOUTHEAST
TN WHERE THERE COULD BE ENOUGH WEAK INSTABILITY FOR SOME TSTORMS.
HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...BEFORE SLOWLY DRIFTING EASTWARD OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC BY SUNDAY. A DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW ON THE WESTERN
SIDE OF THIS HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL THEN BRING UNSEASONABLY WARM
TEMPS AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...LEADING TO
THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED TSTORMS FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. AS FOR
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE
EXTENDED PERIOD... WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
305 AM EST MON MAR 5 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
FAST-MOVING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER SOUTHEAST KY...WITH 
ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS MIDDLE TN. THIS 
SYSTEM WILL QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE SUNRISE... 
WITH NORTHWEST FLOW BEHIND THE COLD FRONT PRODUCING SOME ADDITIONAL 
SCATTERED RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS. WITH A WARM AND DRY AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...THESE SHOWERS HAVE NOT BEEN PRODUCING 
MUCH SNOW AT THE OBS SITES OUTSIDE OF SOUTHWEST VA. IN FACT...TEMPS 
ARE STILL IN THE 40S MOST EVERYWHERE IN EAST TN...ESPECIALLY BELOW 
2500 FEET. WARM TEMPS IN THE 40S ARE EVEN BEING REPORTED OVER MIDDLE 
TN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT ANY SNOWFALL THIS 
MORNING WILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME ACCUMULATING ON THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU AND NORTHEAST TN...SO WILL CANCEL THE ADVISORIES IN THESE 
AREAS. IT APPEARS THAT SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS WILL STILL 
HAVE A SHOT OF SOME SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS...SO WILL LEAVE THESE 
AREAS IN A WARNING OR ADVISORY FOR A FEW MORE HOURS. WILL ALSO ISSUE 
A WIND ADVISORY FOR THIS MORNING ACROSS THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS AND THE 
NORTHEAST TN MOUNTAINS. HIGH PRESSURE THEN QUICKLY BUILDS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA BY TONIGHT...BRINGING DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS. AS 
FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL START 
DRY AND MILD THANKS TO A STRONG RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING 
FROM EAST OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS TO THE SOUTHEAST UNITED 
STATES. THIS RIDGING WILL PRODUCE DRY CONDITIONS TUESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY.

BY THURSDAY...A NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE WILL RACE ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST CANADA AND ANOTHER OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS/NORTHERN 
GREAT LAKES HELPING TO PULL A COLD FRONTS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
BY FRIDAY. A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
WILL PULL MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OVER THIS FRONT TO PRODUCE 
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY. ENOUGH INSTABILITY NOTED TO INCLUDE A 
CHANCE OF THUNDER FOR THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST 
AREA.

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...THIS BOUNDARY PULLS WELL SOUTH OF THE AREA...BUT 
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF 
ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE OVER THE BOUNDARY TO KEEP CLOUDS MOSTLY CLOUDY 
WITH A GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN RETURNING BY SUNDAY. THERE IS A LOT OF 
UNCERTAINTY OF THE PLACEMENT OF THE SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH/LOW 
NEXT WEEKEND...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

349 PM EST SUN MAR 4 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FLURRIES AND SNOW SHOWERS
POPPED EARLY TODAY AND AIRMASS SEEMS TO BE COLDER THAN ADVERTISED.
TRACK OF THE UPPER TROUGH AND VORT MAX IS VERY CONSISTENT BETWEEN
GFS AND NAM AGAIN...AND THE SWATH OF PRECIPITATION ALSO IS RIGHT
ACROSS SW VA AND NRN PARTS OF E TN. SOME CHANGES OF CONCERN WERE...
1) SURFACE COLD FRONT WITH FRONTOGENETICAL FORCING ADDED IN...AND
DEEP MOISTURE OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA...ACTUALLY UP TO 600
MBS ACROSS NRN AREAS. VERY COLD ALOFT SO EXCELLENT SNOW GROWTH.

THIS ALL FITS IN WELL WITH HPC WINTER WEATHER DESK GRAPHIC FOR DAY
1 NOW DEPICTING HEAVIER SNOW ACROSS SW VA. THUS...I UPGRADED THE
ADVISORY TO A WARNING FOR SW VA AND THE NRN MTNS OF E TN. THE
MOISTURE AND LIFT SEEMS TO ALSO SUPPORT A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY
FOR LESSER SNOW ACROSS NRN PLATEAU AND THE TRI CITIES AREAS. THE
CENTRAL VALLEY...INCLUDING LAKEWAY AREA...COULD GET A DUSTING UP TO
2 INCHES...BUT I DID NOT ADD AN ADVISORY THERE YET.

BRISK W-NW WINDS ARE SOME CONCERN BUT SHOULD STAY JUST BELOW
ADVISORY CRITERIA. OTHERWISE...I UNDERCUT MINS TONIGHT AND MAXES
MONDAY...IN ANTICIPATION OF ACCUMULATING SNOW TONIGHT AND MONDAY.

MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY GRIDS LOOKED RIGHT ON TRACK AS SURFACE AND
UPPER RIDGE BUILD IN...AND TEMPS QUICKLY REBOUND ABOVE SEASONAL
NORMALS AGAIN. GUESS WINTER WANTED TO HIT US WITH A BRIEF REMINDER
THAT WINTER IS NOT OFFICIALLY OVER!


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY IN 
AGREEMENT EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE KEEPING 
DRY WEATHER IN PLACE THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING. THE MODELS START TO 
DIVERGE LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS THE ATMOSPHERE STARTING 
TO GO INTO A PATTERN MORE REMINISCENT OF LATE APRIL INTO MAY AS A 
LUMBERING UPPER LOW FORMS OVER THE DESERT SOUTHWEST ON THURSDAY AND 
ONLY SLOWLY SHIFTS NORTHEAST TOWARD THE MIDWEST BY THE END OF THE 
PERIOD. WENT A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE ECMWF THURSDAY WHICH INDICATES A 
COLD FRONT DROPPING INTO THE AREA FOR HIGHER CHANCE POPS THURSDAY 
NIGHT. MERGED CLOSER TO THE GFS THEREAFTER WITH FASTER PROGRESSION 
OF THE UPPER LOW AND ASSOCIATED LOWER LEVEL PRESSURE CENTERS WHICH 
PULL WARM AND MOIST AIR BACK INTO THE REGION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
THIS IS A LOW PROBABILITY FORECAST DUE TO DIFFERING MODEL SOLUTIONS 
BUT KEPT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS GOING THROUGH THE WEEKEND IN THIS 
UNSETTLED PATTERN. TRENDED TEMPERATURE FORECAST TOWARD HPC 
GUIDANCE.

REVEALING SOME HIGH CLOUDS LINGERING BEHIND IT OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. HIGH CLOUDS WILL LIKELY LINGER THROUGHOUT THE

THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. LIGHT SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS APPEAR POSSIBLE...BUT MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET WHERE TEMPS SHOULD BE BELOW FREEZING. IN

REISSUE THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR CENTRAL EAST TN AND 
NORTHEAST TN OUTSIDE OF THE ADVISORY AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND 
GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT TODAY THROUGH 
MONDAY...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL START THE EXTENDED FORECAST WITH DRY AND MILD WEATHER 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  SURFACE RIDGING WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST LATE 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ALLOWING MOISTURE TO PULL BACK INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY. BY LATE THURSDAY NIGHT 
AND FRIDAY...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA. HERE IS 
WHERE THE MEDIAN RANGE MODELS DIFFER GREATLY. GFS SOLUTION STALLS 
FRONT OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE EXTENDED (SATURDAY)...BUT 
THE ECMWF PULLS BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE REGION. GFS ENSEMBLE SHOWS A 
GOOD DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY OF HOW FAR SOUTH BOUNDARY WILL MOVE. WILL 
TREND TOWARD THE GFS WITH A LESS AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH OVER THE 
NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL ALLOW FRONT TO STALL.

A SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM BECOMES CUT-OFF OVER TEXAS/OKLAHOMA. AGAIN 
MODELS DIFFER ON THIS SYSTEM. FOR THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...PLAN 
ON KEEPING CHANCES OF SHOWERS GOING. INSTABILITY WITH THIS NEXT 
SYSTEM LACKING AND NO PLANNING ON INCLUDING THUNDER.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
331 PM EST SAT MAR 3 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AFTER A VERY SPRING LIKE
SEVERE WEATHER EVENT FRIDAY...WINTER WEATHER MAKES A BRIEF VISIT
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY. 

BEFORE THE WINTRY SYSTEM...MODELS (MOSTLY GFS) DEVELOP A WEAK WAVE
ON THE COLD FRONT TO OUR SOUTH...AND PUSH SOME VERY LIGHT PCPN
NORTHWARD THAT COULD CLIP OUR EXTREME SE AND EASTERN COUNTIES
OVERNIGHT. I AM THINKING MOSTLY CLOUDS SO I WENT WITH A MOS BLEND
MIXING THE DRIER NAM MOS IN WITH GFS MOS POPS.

VERY TEMPTED TO DROP POPS ENTIRELY FOR SUNDAY...BUT LOWERED TO
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR NOW...LEAVING MIDNIGHT SHIFT TO DROP POPS
ENTIRELY IF SO DESIRED. 

NOW THE MAIN EVENT...A RATHER STRONG FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE LOOKS TO
SWEEP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY MONDAY.
FORCING IS ON A SYNOPTIC SCALE INITIALLY BUT ENDS AS A NW UPSLOPE
EVENT MONDAY MORNING...WITH POSITIVE CAPES AROUND 40 J/KG. NAM AND
GFS HANDLE THIS EVENT RATHER SIMILARLY AND I CAN'T REALLY DISAGREE
MUCH WITH WINTER WEATHER DESK GRAPHIC FOR DAY 2. PRECIPITABLE WATER
VALUES ARE AROUND 1/4 TO 1/3 OF AN INCH AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS
SUGGEST MOSTLY SNOW AFTER 03Z TO 06Z MONDAY. 

THUS...I INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY OR HIGHER IN THE FAVORED AREAS
AND MENTIONED SNOW ACCUMS UP TO 2 OR 3 INCHES FOR NOW. SPS TO BE
ISSUED SHORTLY WHICH WILL HIGHLIGHT POTENTIAL FOR LOCALLY HEAVIER
SNOW ACCUMS...MAINLY IN HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA...AS SYNOPTIC
FORCING AND BETTER MOISTURE LOOKS TO BE A LITTLE NORTH OF THE
SMOKIES. ALSO BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS ARE MORE FAVORABLE FOR SNOW
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN MONDAY MORNING.

OTHERWISE...MOS TEMPS GENERALLY FOLLOWED FOR THE SHORT TERM.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS WILL STRUGGLE 
WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM...AS IT WILL PROBABLY AT SOME POINT BE A CUTOFF 
LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN HIGH PLAINS...THUS THE MAIN ISSUE WILL BE 
TIMING OF PRECIP IN OUR AREA. MODELS AVBL AT THIS TIME ARE GREATLY 
DIVERGENT. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY...POPS ARE NO HIGHER THAN 30 
PERCENT LATE NEXT WEEK PARTLY TO MATCH WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES. IN 
THE MEANTIME WE WILL LOOK AT NICE WEATHER FOR MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE AREA WITH TEMPERATURES REBOUNDING BACK TO 
THE ABOVE NORMAL READINGS WE ARE ACCUSTOMED TO OF LATE.

.DISCUSSION...QUIET MORNING AFTER A STORMY DAY/NIGHT YESTERDAY. TWO 
SURVEY TEAMS OUT FROM THE OFFICE TO ASSESS THE DAMAGE ALONG TORNADO 
TRACKS. WE WILL ISSUE PNS REPORTS WITH TRACKS/RATINGS AS INFORMATION 
COMES IN FROM THE SURVEY TEAMS. THANKS TO EVERYONE THAT PASSED ON 
REPORTS VIA PHONE OR FACEBOOK.

FOR TODAY'S FORECAST...COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED SE OF THE REGION BUT A 
WEAK SURFACE LOW IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. 
THIS MAY KEEP A THREAT OF LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS FOR EXTREME SE AREAS 
THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...IT DOES APPEAR THAT A DRY AFTERNOON UNDER 
MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES IS ON TAP. FORECAST GRIDS LOOK ON TRACK...BUT I
PLAN TO REMOVE ANY MORNING WORDING AND FRESHEN GRIDS. 

WILL RE-EVALUATE THE SNOW POTENTIAL FOR SUNDAY NIGHT ACROSS NRN 
PLATEAU...SW VA AND HIGHER TERRAIN OF NE TN. SNOW AMOUNTS WOULD 
APPEAR TO BE ADVISORY CRITERIA BY MONDAY MORNING...BUT MORE ON THIS 
AFTER VIEWING 12Z MODEL DATA AND COORDINATION WITH NWS OFFICES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH MUCH 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR FILTERING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL SOME LINGERING POST-FRONTAL SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS MORNING...WHICH SHOULD GRADUALLY EXIT THE REGION AFTER SUNRISE. 
HOWEVER...NAM AND GFS MODELS AGREE THAT AN AMPLIFYING UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON WILL GENERATE SOME 
ADDITIONAL SHOWER ACTIVITY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS. THUS...WILL LEAVE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE FORECAST THROUGHOUT THE DAY OVER THE 
MOUNTAINS. THIS UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO SWING OVER THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...AND WILL POSSIBLY GENERATING ADDITIONAL 
LIGHT PRECIP (IN THE FORM OF RAIN OR SNOW) OVER THE MOUNTAINS. AS 
FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES 
ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKS 
THROUGH THE AREA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WILL KEEP THE CHANCE POPS 
GOING. TEMPERATURES INDICATE IT SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A MIXTURE 
OR ALL SNOW FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.  
MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. 
HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY. ANOTHER TROUGH APPROACHING THE AREA ON FRIDAY. WITH STILL 
UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING...WILL KEEP ONLY LOW CHANCES FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT ALONG THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER...WITH 
SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION ALREADY DEVELOPING ALONG IT OVER SOUTHEAST 
TN. THIS WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE QUICKLY NORTHWARD ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH DEWPOINTS RISING TO NEAR 60 
DEGREES OVER SOUTHEAST TN AFTER SUNRISE. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE 
LOCAL AIR MASS WILL QUICKLY BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE BY THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH HIGH HELICITY VALUES BETWEEN 500 AND 600 M2/S2 AS 
THE VERTICAL WIND FLOW STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD 
FRONT. MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL BE LOCATED OVER 
MIDDLE TN BY SUNSET...BUT THINK THAT A SQUALL LINE AHEAD OF THIS 
COLD FRONT COULD QUICKLY RACE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AND AFFECT THE 
FORECAST AREA AS EARLY AS LATE AFTERNOON. IN ADDITION...WITH THE 
LOCAL AIR MASS BECOMING MODERATELY UNSTABLE THIS AFTERNOON...AM 
WORRIED THAT SOME DISCRETE SUPERCELLS MAY FORM AHEAD OF THE SQUALL 
LINE. WITH HIGH HELICITY VALUES THIS AFTERNOON...IT APPEARS THAT

DISCRETE SUPERCELLS DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS...IN 
ADDITION TO VERY LARGE HAIL (AROUND GOLFBALL SIZE OR LARGER) AND 
DAMAGING WINDS. MODELS INDICATE A STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 50 KT) 
DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...SO WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WIND 
ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS REVEAL SOME LARGE DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY...BUT ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR TONIGHT. WITH BREEZY SOUTHERLY WINDS EXPECTED TODAY... 
WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER GFS NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE MEDIUM RANGE FORECAST 
WILL START WITH A FAIRLY DEEP UPPER TROUGH ACROSS SOUTHEAST CANADA/ 
EASTERN GREAT LAKES WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINA AND 
GULF COAST STATES. COLDER AND DRIER AIR WILL SPILL INTO THE FORECAST 
WITH SHOWERS ENDING EARLY SATURDAY.

FOR LATE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE AND 
ASSOCIATED REINFORCING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE COLD ENOUGH FOR A MIXTURE OR ALL 
SNOW FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.  MINOR SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. FOLLOWED 
COLDER MET MOS GUIDANCE FOR SUNDAY'S HIGHS DUE TO CLOUD AND 
PRECIPITATION.

.AVIATION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT 
JUST SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER...WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS IN THE 
60S OVER CENTRAL AL AND CENTRAL GA. THIS WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
CONTINUE MOVING NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING... 
WITH CEILINGS GRADUALLY LOWERING AND SHOWERS DEVELOPING TOWARDS 
SUNRISE AND THEREAFTER. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION VCSH SINCE TIMING 
THESE SHOWERS AT THE TAF SITES WILL BE PROBLEMATIC. SOUTHERLY WINDS 
WILL BECOME GUSTY THIS AFTERNOON...AS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
MOVES OVER THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY. A SQUALL LINE IS EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP AHEAD OF ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OVER MIDDLE TN BY MID TO 
LATE AFTERNOON...AND SHOULD BEGIN TO AFFECT THE TAF SITES BY THE 
EVENING HOURS.

.DISCUSSION...
A WARM FRONT WILL BE LIFTING NORTHWARD INTO THE AREA
OVERNIGHT...BRINGING DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S TO AROUND 60 AND RISING
TEMPERATURES LATE TONIGHT. ISENTROPIC LIFT AND ELEVATED INSTABILITY
WILL PRODUCE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AFTER 06Z.
MODELS ARE SHOWING THAT RAIN WILL DEVELOP WITHIN THE NEXT FEW HOURS
OVER CNTL AL...REACHING CHA AROUND 08-09Z. SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED TO
BE NEAR KNOXVILLE AROUND SUNRISE. 

NOT MUCH CHANGE IN REGARD TO THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT TOMORROW
NIGHT. THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN TN VALLEY APPEAR TO HAVE
THE BEST CHANCES OF SEEING SEVERE STORMS. STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO
DEVELOP IN MIDDLE TN...REACHING OUR WESTERN COUNTIES AROUND 03Z
GIVE OR TAKE AN HOUR...THEN MOVE THROUGH THE VALLEY 04Z-08Z. WHILE
THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING WILL CURB THE INSTABILITY A BIT...A 50+
KT LLJ...STRONG LOW LEVEL FRONTOGENETICAL FORCING...AND STRONG
UPPER DIVERGENCE WILL HELP SUSTAIN SEVERE STORMS INTO THE TN
VALLEY. DISCRETE SUPERCELLS WILL BE THE FAVORED MODE OF
CONVECTION...WITH TORNADOES POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHLY SHEARED
ENVIRONMENT. THE IMPACT LOOKS GREATER THAN THE EVENT
YESTERDAY...AND ALL RESIDENTS OF THE AREA WILL WANT TO STAY ALERT
TO THE LATEST UPDATES. AN SPS WILL BE ISSUED TO BETTER HIGHLIGHT
THE THREAT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
AND ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL ALLOW THE EVENING TO START OUT CLEAR...
BEFORE CLOUDS INCREASE LATE TONIGHT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING WARM
FRONT. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE THE MAIN SOURCE OF LIFT...WITH A
MOIST AIRMASS BEING LIFTED (PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES GREATER THAN
1.00 INCH). ELEVATED INSTABILITY SUGGESTS THUNDERSTORMS...BUT MOST
LIKELY NOT STRONG TO SEVERE. MODEL QPF MAY BE OVERDONE...BUT STAYED
CLOSE TO HPC QPF. WARM AIR SHOULD SUPPORT AT LEAST A MOS BLEND FOR
HIGHS FRIDAY...WITH LOWS TONIGHT MILD 50S SOUTH TO COOLER UPPER 30S
NORTH.

THINKING THAT THERE WILL BE AT LEAST A BRIEF BREAK IN CONVECTION
WITH THE WARM FRONT...BEFORE THE COLD FRONT ARRIVES. NOT SURE HOW
MUCH PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION POPS AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...BUT I
DID LOWER POPS BRIEFLY TO A CHANCE IN THE EAST. CATEGORICAL POPS
LATE FRIDAY NIGHT WHICH THEN TAPER OFF ON SATURDAY MORNING. THE
SEVERE THREAT LOOKS TO ARRIVE MID TO LATE FRIDAY EVENING AND THEN
LASTS OVERNIGHT.

EXPECTED QPF WOULD NOT APPEAR TO RAISE ANY RIVER LEVELS TO ACTION
STAGE OR ANY HIGHER. NAM WINDS COULD BE A LITTLE TOO STRONG WITH
THIS SYSTEM...BUT SPEEDS MAY REACH NEAR WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA
FRIDAY NIGHT. I HELD OFF ON AN ADVISORY FOR NOW. 

OTHERWISE...CLOSELY FOLLOWED MOS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL BE SLOW TO SHIFT EAST SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY AS AT LEAST 
TWO SHORT WAVE IMPULSES DROP SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE PREVAILING 
NORTHWEST FLOW ON BACK SIDE OF THE FEATURE. THE FIRST SHIFTS ACROSS 
THE REGION ON SUNDAY PRODUCING A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA WHILE ANOTHER CLIPPER 
SYSTEM MOVES IN SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING. CHILLY AIR 
STREAMING IN SUNDAY NIGHT WILL MEAN THAT RAIN WILL BE CHANGING TO 
SNOW...ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE A STRONG NORTHWEST 
FLOW WILL CREATE A DECENT ENVIRONMENT FOR SNOW SHOWERS. THE CHANCE 
FOR SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MID DAY MONDAY...IN THE 
MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...BEFORE 
ENDING. A NICE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AGAIN TO AID IN 
WARMING AND A RETURN TO DRY WEATHER TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. BY 
THURSDAY ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL BE 
APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA. PLACED JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A 
SHOWER IN THE FORECAST DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING/STRENGTH OF THIS 
SYSTEM.

.AVIATION...A LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL STRENGTHEN AS IT SHIFTS SLOWLY
SOUTHEAST FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH
THE FORECAST PERIOD. DURING THIS TIME FRAME A SHORTER WAVELENGTH
SYSTEM WILL SWING EAST FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE MID
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND THE STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF
THIS FEATURE WILL BRING WARM AND MOIST AIR NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF
LATER TONIGHT INTO MID DAY FRIDAY. AT THE INCREASINGLY MOIST
AIRMASS LIFTS NORTH ALONG THE RETURNING WARM FRONT...SCATTERED
SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP LATER TONIGHT AFFECTING CHA AROUND 07Z AND
LATER. THE SHOWERS WILL BUILD NORTHEAST POSSIBLY AFFECTING TYS AND
TRI AROUND 11-14Z. APPLIED AN MVFR CEILING AT CHA LATER TONIGHT.
NOT SURE IF AN MVFR CEILING WILL BE ABLE TO FORM AT TYS AND TRI AS
THE STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY COMPONENT ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN LEADS
TO AN EROSION OF LOWER CEILINGS AT THESE TERMINALS.

BUT FORECAST HIGHS LOOK GOOD. ANY AFFECTED WEB PRODUCTS WILL GET AN 
UPDATE...BUT ZFPMRX WON'T NEED AN UPDATE. 

CLOUDS LOOK TO INCREASE TONIGHT AS ISENTROPIC LIFT GETS UNDERWAY BY 
06Z FRIDAY. ELEVATED INSTABILITY WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER GREATER 
THAN 1 INCH FRIDAY MORNING...AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE A FACTOR 
THROUGH AT LEAST 15Z FRIDAY. THIS WOULD INDICATE POTENTIAL FOR

REACH OUR AREA BY LATE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS. MAX TEMPS
HAVE BEEN HELD BACK SOME BY CLOUDS AND SPOTTY CONVECTION AHEAD OF
THE LINE...SO INSTABILITY HAS BEEN LIMITED THUS FAR.

KEEPING POPS HIGH FOR MUCH OF TONIGHT...DUE TO ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE LINE OF SEVERE STORMS PLUS ANY LINGERING CONVECTION ALONG 
THE ACTUAL FRONTAL BOUNDARY. LATER 3 PERIODS GENERALLY WERE ON TRACK 
IN PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS WITH JUST SOME VERY MINOR TWEAKS. BOTH 
THURSDAY AND EARLY THURSDAY NIGHT LOOK TO BE DRY...BEFORE NEXT 
SYSTEM SPREADS CLOUDS AND SHOWERS NE LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY. PUSHED POPS UP TO LIKELY BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...AS ONLY NAM 
WAS SLUGGISH IN SPREADING RAINS NE. ALL OTHER MODELS OFFERED TIMING 
VERY SIMILAR TO WETTER GFS MODEL...INCLUDING ECMWF/CMC AND SREF.
ONE OTHER ITEM WAS TO ADD THUNDERSTORMS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS TEMPS EXCEPT I DID UNDERCUT THE WARMER 
MOS NUMBERS FOR HIGHS FRIDAY...DUE TO CLOUDS AND EARLIER START TO 
SHOWERS. MILDER MINS THURSDAY NIGHT SEEMED A BETTER CHOICE GIVEN
INCREASING CLOUDS.

.DISCUSSION...
UPDATED SEVERE WEATHER PRODUCTS THIS MORNING AS OUR AREA NOW FALLS
WITHIN THE MODERATE RISK OF SEVERE STORMS. FRESH HWO PRODUCT AND
GRAPHICAST HAVE BEEN ISSUED. STILL LOOKS LIKE INITIAL SEVERE STORMS
REACH OUR WRN MOST COUNTIES BY 3PM TO 4PM EST...THEN MOVE RAPIDLY
EAST AND AFFECT REMAINDER OF OUR COUNTIES INTO AT LEAST MID
EVENING.

WILL NOW TWEAK A FEW FORECAST GRIDS...MAINLY RAIN CHANCES REST OF
THE MORNING AND VERY EARLY AFTERNOON...BEFORE CATEGORICAL POPS ARE
JUSTIFIED FOR MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. WILL FRESHEN HOURLY TEMPS AND
DEW POINT TEMPS...PLUS CHECK MAX TEMPS. GRADIENT WINDS AWAY FROM
ANY STORMS SHOULD STAY BELOW ADVISORY SPEEDS...SO ANY WIND DAMAGE
WOULD MOST LIKELY BE ATTRIBUTED TO THUNDERSTORMS.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
414 AM EST WED FEB 29 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE AREA
WAS LOCATED OVER IOWA EARLY THIS MORNING WITH A COLD FRONT
EXTENDING SOUTHWEST THROUGH MO INTO TX. STRONG LOW LEVEL JET IS
FEEDING INTO THIS SYSTEM WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WIDESPREAD
OVER KY AND ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS OVER NE TN AT
THIS HOUR. TEMPERATURES ARE MUCH WARMER THIS MORNING IN THE 50S
WITH DEW POINTS IN THE MID 40S TO MID 50S AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
INCREASES. THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS
UPPER LEVEL LOW MOVES ACROSS NORTHERN MS VALLEY AND STRONG MID
LEVEL JET OF AROUND 80 TO 90 KNOTS BRINGS WARM MOIST AIR MASS INTO THE
OH VALLEY. STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE OVER KY THIS MORNING AND
EXTEND INTO MIDDLE TN LATER IN THE MORNING. AS INDICATED IN DAY 1
CONVECTIVE OUTLOOK HEATING TODAY WILL CAUSE MORE CONVECTION TO
DEVELOP OVER WEST TN JUST AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AND MOVE EAST
INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS EVENING.
DAMAGING WINDS SHOULD BE THE BIGGEST THREAT WITH A LINE OF STORMS
BUT LARGE HAIL IS POSSIBLE WITH ANY SUPERCELLS AND ISOLATED
TORNADOES. HEAVY RAINFALL IS POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS
ORGANIZED CONVECTION MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. WINDS WILL BE
QUITE STRONG ALOFT AND GUSTS APPROACHING WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA
COULD OCCUR IN SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OVER SW VA AND THE
NORTHERN PLATEAU. STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST OF THE
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS BY AROUND MIDNIGHT WITH SKIES CLEARING DURING
THE LATE NIGHT HOURS. CLOUDS WILL LIMIT TEMPERATURES WARMING TODAY
SOMEWHAT BUT HIGHS SHOULD REACH THE LOWER 70S IN THE LOWER
ELEVATIONS AS STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES AHEAD OF COLD
FRONT. GENERALLY FOLLOWED MET/MAV GUIDANCE FOR LOWS TONIGHT MAINLY
MID 40S TO NEAR 50.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO EXTENDED 
FORECAST. A ZONAL FLOW ALOFT ON THURSDAY WILL BECOME MORE AMPLIFIED 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS. 
BACKING 850 MB WINDS WILL INCREASE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT THURSDAY NIGHT. THE NAM IS DRIER THAN THE GFS THIS 
PERIOD...BUT WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WETTER GFS WHICH HAS SUPPORT FROM 
THE CANADIAN AND ECMWF MODELS. AT THE SURFACE A WARM FRONT PUSHES 
INTO THE AREA ON FRIDAY...BRINGING MILD TEMPS IN THE 70S AND 
DEWPOINTS INTO THE 50S. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A WEAKENING CAP 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...WHILE THE LLJ STRENGTHENS TO NEAR 50 KTS. 
EXPECT THAT CONVECTION WILL INITIATE IN THE AFTERNOON OVER MIDDLE TN 
CLOSER TO THE UPPER JET AND IN THE INSTABILITY AXIS...WITH STORMS 
MOVING INTO THE AREA IN THE EVENING. GOOD MODEL CONSENSUS SHOWS THE 
STRONGEST SYNOPTIC LIFT FRIDAY NIGHT. DRY AIR AND STRONG WINDS 
THROUGH THE MID LEVELS WILL MEAN STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS WILL BE THE 
MAIN THREAT...BUT CAPE VALUES AND HIGH DEEP-LAYER SHEAR WILL SUPPORT 
HAIL AS WELL. 

LEANING TOWARD GFS SOLUTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF FORECAST. BACKED 
OFF ON POPS SATURDAY ESPECIALLY IN THE AFTERNOON. LONG WAVE TROUGH 
EXTENDS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FROM SUNDAY INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. GFS HAS BEEN TRENDING COLDER WITH REINFORCING SHORT WAVE 
SUNDAY NIGHT. BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS INTO MONDAY. BACKED OFF ON POPS 
SUN NGT BUT INTRODUCED SOME SNOW FLURRIES ACROSS NORTHERN AREA. 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVES ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE REMAINDER OF 
THE EXTENDED.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT 
STRETCHING ACROSS KENTUCKY AND SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA...WITH AN 
UNSEASONABLY MILD AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS CLOUDS INCREASING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
THIS EVENING...WITH AREA RADARS REVEALING SOME SCATTERED LIGHT 
SHOWERS OVER THE DEEP SOUTH. MODELS INDICATE SOME INCREASING 
ISENTROPIC LIFT OVERNIGHT...WITH A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE ALSO 
MOVING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THUS...EXPECT SHOWERS TO BECOME 
LIKELY AFTER MIDNIGHT...BUT RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL PROBABLY BE ON THE 
LIGHT SIDE. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE LOCAL AIR MASS WILL 
REMAIN FAIRLY STABLE OVERNIGHT...SO WILL BACK OFF ON THE TSTORM 
WORDING IN THE ZONES BY MENTIONING SHOWERS BECOMING LIKELY WITH ONLY 
A CHANCE OF TSTORMS. WITH CLOUDS AND DEWPOINTS SLOWLY INCREASING 
THROUGH THE NIGHT...THINK THAT TEMPS WILL REMAIN ON THE WARM SIDE 
OVERNIGHT.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO REMOVE 
ANY EVENING PRECIP WORDING...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING 
TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...CLOUDS STILL 
SPREADING ACROSS CWA SW-NE...ALTOCU FIRST THEN STRATOCU.  CEILINGS 
REALLY LOW BACK UNDER CANOPY...CENTRAL AL/MS BACK TO GULF COAST.  
TRAJECTORY FORECASTS SHOWING 500-1500M TRAJECTORIES COMING STRAIGHT 
FROM THIS AREA...SO LOTS OF DEEP MOISTURE UNDERGOING ISENTROPIC LIFT.

BREEZY CONDITIONS EXPECTED TOMORROW...AND UNSURPRISINGLY...THERE 
SHOULD BE GOOD SHEAR AS WELL.  INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED TO BE 
MARGINAL...WITH SREF MLCAPE VALUES ONLY AROUND 500 J/KG IN THE LATE
AFTERNOON AND WEAKENING INTO THE EVENING. HOWEVER...0-6 SHEAR
VALUES ARE EXPECTED TO BE 70+ KT...AND 0-1 HELICITY VALUES OF 200+
M2/S2. WOULD EXPECT INITIAL THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT TO START AHEAD
OF THE FRONT IN THE THETA-E RIDGE WELL W AND NW OF HERE DURING THE
AFTERNOON...AND THEN FOR A LINE OF STORMS TO MOVE TOWARD AND
THROUGH THE AREA DURING LATE AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT. MOST OF THE
PRECIP SHOULD BE EAST OR SOUTHEAST OF THE CWA BY 12Z THURSDAY.

WENT VERY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS...ONLY TWEAKING MAX TEMPS 
WED...BUMPING UP SRN AREAS 1-3 DEGREES...AND BUMPING DOWN NRN AREAS 
1-2 DEG.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A ZONAL FLOW ALOFT ON THURSDAY WILL BECOME MORE AMPLIFIED THURSDAY 
NIGHT AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS. BACKING 850 
MB WINDS WILL INCREASE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC 
LIFT THURSDAY NIGHT. THE NAM IS DRIER THAN THE GFS THIS PERIOD...BUT 
WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WETTER GFS WHICH HAS SUPPORT FROM THE CANADIAN 
AND ECMWF MODELS. AT THE SURFACE A WARM FRONT PUSHES INTO THE AREA 
ON FRIDAY...BRINGING MILD TEMPS IN THE 70S AND DEWPOINTS INTO THE 
50S. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A WEAKENING CAP THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON...WHILE THE LLJ STRENGTHENS TO NEAR 50 KTS. EXPECT THAT 
CONVECTION WILL INITIATE IN THE AFTERNOON OVER MIDDLE TN CLOSER TO 
THE UPPER JET AND IN THE INSTABILITY AXIS...WITH STORMS REACHING THE 
PLATEAU AROUND 00Z SATURDAY. WITH GOOD MODEL CONSENSUS SHOWING THE 
STRONGEST SYNOPTIC LIFT COMING FRIDAY NIGHT...WILL RAISE POPS TO 
CATEGORICAL THAT PERIOD. LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING MAY HELP STORMS 
WEAKEN A BIT BEFORE REACHING OUR AREA...BUT THE NAM STILL SHOWS CAPE 
VALUES OF 1000-1500 J/KG AT 00Z. DRY AIR AND STRONG WINDS THROUGH 
THE MID LEVELS WILL MEAN STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN 
THREAT...BUT CAPE VALUES AND HIGH DEEP-LAYER SHEAR WILL SUPPORT HAIL 
AS WELL. TORNADO THREAT CANNOT BE RULED OUT...BUT WILL DEPEND ON 
MESOSCALE BOUNDARIES WHICH ARE TOO DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN THIS FAR 
OUT. IF THE SURFACE WARM FRONT REMAINS ACROSS THE AREA...THE TORNADO 
THREAT WILL BE HIGHER.

GFS IS THE FASTEST MODEL TO PUSH THE COLD FRONT THROUGH THE 
AREA...PLACING IT EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS BY 12Z SATURDAY...BUT WILL 
KEEP POPS GOING THROUGH SATURDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLOWER ECMWF AND 
EVEN SLOWER CANADIAN. THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS TRAILS WELL BEHIND THE 
FRONT...CROSSING THE AREA ON SUNDAY. COLD TEMPS ALOFT AND VORTICITY 
ADVECTION WILL BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTH ON 
SUNDAY...ALONG WITH COOLER TEMPS. A LARGE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
WILL KEEP THE AREA DRY MONDAY AND TUESDAY...WITH A SLIGHT WARMING 
TREND AS THE HIGH MOVES EASTWARD.

DIFFICULT TO DISCERN...STRICTLY FROM A WIND-SHIFT STANDPOINT.  
FRONTAL LOCATION CAN BE SEEN IN THETA-E ADVECTION...SHOWING IT 
MOVING INTO NW TN NOW.  LOOKS LIKE AN UNEVENTFUL FRONTAL PASSAGE 
THIS EVENING WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT.  AS HIGH SLIDES TO EAST ON TUESDAY A QUICK RETURN FLOW 
ENSUES AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM.  

WILL KEEP POPS LOW TUESDAY AND ONLY IN THE SWRN AREAS IN THE

AFTERNOON IN THE SOUTHWEST AREAS...BUT MOISTURE STILL NEEDS TO BE 
DEEPER TO WARRANT HIGHER POPS FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON...SEE NEXT

.DISCUSSION...WEAK COLD FRONT JUST NOW GETTING INTO NW CORNER OF
TN. PRESENT...RELATIVELY SLOW PACE SHOWS IT GETTING INTO NW PARTS
OF AREA NEAR 7PM...HOWEVER...THIS IS PROBABLY DECEIVING...AS WHOLE
WIND PROFILE IN LOWER 1/2 OF TROPOSPHERE IS CURRENTLY VEERING MORE
AND MORE WESTERLY. THIS WESTERLY COMPONENT SHOULD MIX DOWN WITH
AFTERNOON HEATING...AND THE FRONT SHOULD WASH THROUGH QUICKLY THIS
AFTERNOON WITH LITTLE FANFARE...EXCEPT TO SWEEP OUR CLOUD COVER
AWAY.

TROUGH PASSING SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WHICH WILL PUSH A
WEAK COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY LATE 
THIS EVENING. THE OTHER FEATURE WHICH WILL HAVE MORE IMPACT ON THE

OF LOW LEVEL CLOUD COVER OVER THE GULF EXTENDING INTO THE COASTAL 
PLAIN. INTERESTING TO SEE THIS MOISTURE TRYING TO WORK ITS WAY 
FARTHER NORTH BUT IT IS BEING EATEN ALIVE IN THE LOW DEW POINT AIR 
MASS IN PLACE ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. EVENTUALLY AS ISENTROPIC 
LIFT INCREASES WITH THE WEAK WAVE...A LOWER DECK WILL BUILD ACROSS

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE MID 
ATLANTIC COAST...WHICH WAS PRODUCING A LIGHT SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW 
OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY 
REVEALS CLEAR SKIES OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION...WITH AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER THE GULF COASTAL REGION AND MOVING 
NORTHWARD. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY SPREAD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD HELP 
TO KEEP TEMPS WARMER TONIGHT COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT.

TRACKS PLOWING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY.  AS THESE 
SYSTEMS PASS TO OUR NORTH...TWO ASSOCIATED COLD FRONTS WILL PASS 
THROUGH THE AREA...NUMBER 1 AROUND MID WEEK...AND NUMBER 2 AT THE 
END OF THE WEEK.  NEITHER ONE OF THESE SYSTEMS IS EXPECTED TO BRING 
MUCH INSTABILITY THIS FAR NORTHEAST...HAVE INCLUDED THUNDER FOR 
SYSTEM NUMBER 1...BUT ONLY INCLUDED THUNDER IN THE SWRN PARTS OF THE 
AREA FOR SYSTEM NUMBER 2.  WILL NEED TO WATCH THE INSTABILITY AS 
THESE EVENTS GET CLOSER FOR POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE STORMS. TIMING OF 
SYSTEMS WILL ALSO MATTER WITH A DIFFERENT RESULT IF THE MAIN WAVE 
FOR CONVECTION PASSES THROUGH AT 3PM VERSUS 3AM.  TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD NOT BE ANYTHING EXTREME...JUST A LOT OF WARMING AND COOLING

627 PM EST THU FEB 23 2012

.AVIATION...COLD FRONT NEARING THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER EARLY THIS 
EVENING WITH SOME WEAK CONVERGENCE ACROSS MAINLY W TN. AREA RADARS 
ARE VIRTUALLY ECHO FREE...BUT THERE IS SLIGHT INSTABILITY AND STRONG 
WINDS ALOFT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. SATELLITE PICS SHOW COOLING 
TOPS OVER NE MISSISSIPPI...SO THERE IS STILL POTENTIAL FOR 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP THIS EVENING AND POSSIBLY REACH AT LEAST WRN 
PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA TOWARD MIDNIGHT. BEST CHANCES OF TSRA 
SEEM TO BE CHA...SO DROPPED TYS AND TRI TO VCTS WITH A 4 HOUR PERIOD 
OF SHRA BEFORE DAYBREAK. IF SHRA AND TSRA DO DEVELOP THEN THERE IS A 
POSSIBILITY OF MVFR CONDITIONS LATE TONIGHT. ALSO...STRENGTH OF 
WINDS ALOFT MAY WARRANT LLWS AT TRI...BUT WATCHING THERE FOR SURFACE 
WINDS TO PICK BACK UP AGAIN...WHICH WOULD NEGATE THE NEED FOR LLWS 
AT TRI.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION FOLLOWS...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH 
THE AREA LATER TONIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY. TREND OF THE MODELS IS TO 
SLOW THIS DOWN A BIT FROM EARLIER FORECAST.  BETTER DYNAMICS WILL 
STAY TO OUR NORTH...AND MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY LOOK SOMEWHAT 
LIMITED FOR OUR AREA TONIGHT.  HOWEVER...STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL 
BE A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVING THROUGH TONIGHT...AND 
SOME LINGERING SHOWERS AT LEAST EASTERN AREAS EARLY FRIDAY.  WILL 
CARRY LIKELY POPS TONIGHT...AND STILL SOME POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE 
STORMS GIVEN STRONG LOW LEVEL JET/IMPRESSIVE LOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR.  
WILL CONTINUE SPS FOR THE STORMS TONIGHT. WINDS WILL BE GUSTY FROM 
THE SOUTHWEST AND WEST TONIGHT AND FRIDAY...AND LOOKS LIKE IT MAY 
REACH WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA DURING THE DAY FRIDAY...SO WILL ISSUE A 
WIND ADVISORY FOR ALL ZONES FOR FRIDAY.      


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...AT THE START OF THIS 
PERIOD WE WILL BE UNDER THE LARGE TROUGH THAT IS PLOWING THROUGH THE 
AREA.  THERE WILL BE SOME POST FRONTAL INSTABILITY IN THE 
NORTHEASTERN AREAS THAT WILL ALLOW SOME SNOW SHOWERS FRIDAY NIGHT 
ESPECIALLY AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS...WITH MORE FLURRIES IN THE LOWER 
ELEVATIONS.  THIS SYSTEM MOVES ON TO THE EAST AND LEAVES THE AREA 
DRY UNTIL ABOUT THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK WHEN THE NEXT SYSTEM CLOSES 
IN.  THERE SHOULD BE A THREAT OF THUNDER BY MID WEEK AHEAD OF THIS 
FRONT...DEW POINTS AND INSTABILITY LOOK TO BE A LITTLE LOW FOR 
THREAT OF SEVERE RIGHT NOW...BUT WILL NEED TO MONITOR.

.AVIATION...PATCHY MVFR STRATUS CEILINGS AND MVFR FOG THIS MORNING.
WORST CONDITIONS EARLY AT TRI WITH CHA A LITTLE BETTER. APPARENTLY
DOWNSLOPE FLOW IS KEEPING TYS DECENT TO START OUT THE FORECAST
PERIOD. INSOLATION SHOULD HELP TO MIX OUT THE LOW LEVELS LEADING TO
VFR FLIGHT. GUSTY SOUTHWEST BREEZE KICKS IN DURING THE DAY. WHILE
THERE IS A SMALL CHANCE FOR A SHOWER LATER THIS AFTERNOON AT CHA
AND TYS. THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL DEVELOP AROUND 01-03Z AS
CONVECTION BUILDS ACROSS THE TERMINALS AHEAD OF A STRONG COLD
FRONT. APPLIED MVFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS FOR THE STORMS WHICH MAY
PRODUCE DAMAGING WIND AS STRONGER DOWNDRAFT WINDS ALOFT ARE
BROUGHT DOWN TO THE SURFACE.

400 AM EST THU FEB 23 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL SHIFT
EAST FROM THE PLAINS STATES TO THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
PRIOR TO THE MAIN EVENT...THERE COULD BE A COUPLE OF SHOWERS AND 
POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE EARLY IN THE DAY AS A WEAK IMPULSE RIDES EAST IN THE FAST 
UPPER LEVEL FLOW. LOW LEVELS A LITTLE MOIST THIS MORNING SO PATCHES 
OF BKN-OVC STRATUS AND SOME FOG WILL TAKE A LITTLE WHILE TO 
DISSIPATE AS MIXING GETS UNDERWAY WITH STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL WEST 
TO SOUTHWEST WINDS. MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT ON THE LATE 
DAY/NIGHT TIME SYSTEM. DIFFERENCES IN LOW LEVEL MOISTENING WERE 
NOTED BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS AS A STRENGTHENING SURFACE LOW SHIFTS 
EAST FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY BY 00Z 
FRIDAY. THE GFS LOOKED A LITTLE CLOSER TO REALITY WITH A CONVECTIVE 
LINE DEVELOPING JUST EAST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND DRIVING TOWARD THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TOWARD EVENING.

MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW IMPRESSIVE SHEAR WITH THE DEVELOPING SYSTEM 
WITH HELICITY VALUES AROUND 400-500 M2/S2 HOWEVER...INSTABILITY 
APPEARS TO BE SOMEWHAT LIMITED. STILL BELIEVE CONVECTION WILL 
DEVELOP ALONG A SQUALL LINE DURING THE EVENING HOURS WHICH SHOULD 
MAKE PROGRESS THROUGH MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 07Z FRIDAY. 
TRAILING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE ACROSS THE HIGH TERRAIN ALONG 
THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER BY 12Z BRINGING AN END TO THE RAIN. 
CERTAINLY ENOUGH WIND ENERGY WILL BE PRESENT ALONG THE CONVECTIVE 
LINE TO PRODUCE DAMAGING WIND AND HAIL. CANNOT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED 
TORNADO AS WELL WITH SUCH HIGH HELICITY VALUES.

WENT AHEAD AND STAYED CLOSE TO IF NOT A DEGREE ABOVE THE WARMEST 
GUIDANCE TEMPS TODAY WITH AMAZINGLY MILD MAX TEMPS IN THE UPPER 60S 
AND LOWER 70S MOST AREAS. WENT CLOSER TO A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MINS 
TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL BE ALONG THE 
APPALACHIANS BY 12Z FRIDAY. WITH A +150 KT 300 MB JET AND STRONG 500 
MB COOLING WITH THE TROUGH PASSAGE...SCATTERED TO ISOLATED SHOWERS 
WILL PERSIST IN NORTHERN AREAS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. COLD 
ADVECTION WILL ALLOW FOR A CHANGE TO SNOW FRIDAY NIGHT...AND A +30 
KT NW FLOW AT 850 MB WILL PROVIDE SOME UPSLOPE ENHANCEMENT. HOWEVER 
MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED SO ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT 
AND MAINLY IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SURFACE WINDS WILL BE CLOSE TO WIND 
ADVISORY CRITERIA ON FRIDAY.

A BUILDING RIDGE WILL PROVIDE DRY WEATHER AND WARMING TEMPS THROUGH 
MONDAY. A SOUTHERLY FLOW STRENGTHENS ON TUESDAY AS LOW PRESSURE 
DEEPENS OVER THE PLAINS. GFS AND ECMWF GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT THAT 
THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AND WILL 
HAVE CHANCE POPS IN THAT TIME FRAME. WILL HAVE A MENTION OF 
THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE GFS SHOWS A STRONG LLJ DEVELOPING 
AND GOOD ADVECTION OF GULF MOISTURE AHEAD OF A STRONG COLD FRONT. 
TEMPS WILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL AGAIN FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK.

CONCERNING LOW LEVEL MOISTENING ON SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AS THE TWO
THOUSAND FOOT CEILINGS SCATTER OUT AT TIMES. THERE IS A SMALL
CHANCE FOR A LIGHT SHOWER DURING THE DAY. HOWEVER...THE MAIN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL 
ENHANCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS EVENING...BUT THESE SHOULD 
DIMINISH TO JUST SHOWERS AND WILL EXIT AFTER MIDNIGHT.  WILL CARRY 
LIKELY POPS ALL ZONES TONIGHT.  STILL SOME THREAT OF SEVERE LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING MAINLY SOUTHERN HALF WHERE BETTER 
DESTABILIZATION HAS OCCURRED NEAR AND SOUTH OF THE WARM FRONT.  
TOMORROW CLOUDS SHOULD BREAK AND ALLOW FOR A MOSTLY SUNNY 
AFTERNOON.  TEMPS THURSDAY WILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL...AND WINDS 
WILL BE GUSTY FROM THE SOUTHWEST.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO JUST SOME TWEAKS MAINLY TO RAISE SOME LOWS 
TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AFTER A WARM AND
BREEZY THURSDAY A DEEP LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO
VALLEY WILL KEEP STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA
THURSDAY NIGHT. A STRONG SHORT WAVE MOVING INTO THE MID MS VALLEY
WILL ENHANCE MOISTURE TRANSPORT AND LIFT AND WITH STRONG WINDS
ALOFT AND HIGH SHEAR A SQUALL LINE IS POSSIBLE LATE IN THE EVENING
AND EARLY MORNING FRIDAY. THE ENVIRONMENT IS ALSO FAVORABLE FOR
ISOLATED SUPERCELLS JUST AHEAD OF THE SQUALL LINE WITH LARGE HAIL AND
A FEW TORNADOES POSSIBLE. THE STRONG WINDS MAY REQUIRE A WIND
ADVISORY FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY. FRIDAY SHOWERS LINGER AND
TEMPERATURES ARE MUCH COOLER BEHIND FRONT. ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL
DISTURBANCE WITHIN THE UPPER TROUGH BEHIND THE COLD FRONT FRIDAY
NIGHT WILL BRING SOME SNOW SHOWERS TO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA. AT THIS TIME AMOUNTS LOOK TO BE ABOUT AN INCH OR
LESS FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY MORNING. LOWS FRIDAY NIGHT WILL
BE NEAR FREEZING CENTRAL AND SOUTH AND A FEW DEGREES BELOW FREEZING
NORTH AND MOUNTAINS. HIGHER PRESSURE BUILDS IN SATURDAY AFTERNOON
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. FOR THE PERIOD MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.
ECMWF AND CANADIAN BRINGS SYSTEM IN MONDAY AND TUESDAY. GFS KEEPS
HIGH PRESSURE OVER FORECAST AREA FOR THE FIRST OF THE WEEK WITH
MAIN SYSTEM WEDNESDAY. WILL FOLLOW CLOSER TO ECMWF AND GRADUALLY
INCREASE POPS WITH UNSETTLED PATTERN MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

415 AM EST WED FEB 22 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE MODELS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK 
WITH EXPECTED WEATHER ACROSS THE MID SOUTH TODAY AS CONVECTION 
FIRING OVER NORTHERN ARKANSAS EARLY THIS MORNING IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
AN INITIAL SHORT WAVE FEATURE THAT WILL BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS AROUND MID DAY INTO THE AFTERNOON. A SECOND IMPULSE 
WILL DROP SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE UPPER MIDWEST TO AFFECT THE FORECAST 
AREA LATE IN THE DAY AND DURING THE EVENING. UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE 
WILL INCREASE AS 90 KT JET STREAKS ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. THE LOW 
LEVEL JET WILL ALSO BE STRENGTHENING THIS MORNING PULLING WARM AND 
MOIST AIR NORTH. AS COLD AIR ALOFT STREAMS IN WITH THE UPPER LEVEL 
WAVE THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD DESTABILIZE SUFFICIENTLY FOR CONVECTION. 
MODEL CAPES NOT TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE AROUND 150 TO 250 J/KG BUT SHEAR 
SHOULD COMPENSATE WITH AVERAGE 0-6 KM AVERAGE WIND AROUND 50 KTS. 
SEVERE CONVECTION POSSIBLE AS THE STRONG FLOW IS TAPPED. SRH WILL BE 
RATHER SIGNIFICANT AS WELL WITH VALUES AROUND 300 TO 400 M2/S2. 
FREEZING LEVEL SHOULD BE LOW ENOUGH FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LARGE 
HAIL IN SOME OF THE STRONGER STORMS. MUCH OF THE CONVECTION WILL 
SHIFT EAST WHILE WEAKENING LATE THIS EVENING. WENT WITH THE WARMER 
MAV MOS FOR MAXES TODAY WHILE OPTING FOR THE MILDER MET MIN GUIDANCE 
TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...ON THURSDAY A SURFACE LOW 
WILL DEVELOP NEAR THE OZARKS AS A UPPER TROUGH DIGS SOUTHWARD ACROSS 
THE PLAINS AND A STRONG UPPER JET DEVELOPS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. IN 
RESPONSE...SURFACE WINDS IN THE TN VALELY BACK TO A SOUTHERLY 
DIRECTION AND STRENGTHEN TO 15-25 MPH THURSDAY AFTERNOON. WARM 
ADVECTION WILL RAISE TEMPS INTO THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S IN MUCH 
OF THE AREA. A CAPPING INVERSION SHOULD HOLD BACK CONVECTIVE 
ACTIVITY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...BUT THE POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR A 
SIGNIFICANT SEVERE WEATHER EVENT THURSDAY NIGHT ONCE THE CAP IS 
BROKEN. MESOSCALE LIFT MAXIMIZES OVER THE AREA BETWEEN 03-09Z A 
FRONTOGENESIS ZONE COINCIDES WITH A 150 KT JET AT 300 MB ACROSS ERN 
KY. DRY AIR ALOFT ORIGINATING FROM THE DESERT SW WILL PROVIDE AN 
ELEVATED MIXED LAYER AND STEEP LAPSE RATES. THE TRACK OF THE SURFACE 
LOW ACROSS KY WILL BACK SURFACE WINDS...RESULTING IN HIGH 0-1 KM 
HELICITY AND GREATER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FLUX CONVERGENCE. MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY WILL BE A LIMITING FACTOR. DAMAGING WINDS APPEAR TO BE 
THE MAIN THREAT...BUT TORNADOES WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE GIVEN THE 
STRONGLY SHEARED ENVIRONMENT. GIVEN THE THREAT WILL COME AT NIGHT 
AND WE ARE IN A TIME OF YEAR WHEN SEVERE WEATHER AWARENESS IS 
TYPICALLY LOW...WILL ISSUE AN SPS TO HEIGHTEN AWARENESS.

A BROAD 500 MB TROUGH WILL PUSH ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY AND FRIDAY 
NIGHT...WITH COLD TEMPS ALOFT KEEPING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
GOING...MAINLY IN NORTHERN AREAS. A CHANCE TO SNOW MAY BE POSSIBLE 
NORTH BEFORE ENDING EARLY SATURDAY MORNING...WITH SOME UPSLOPE 
ENHANCEMENT FROM A 30 KT NW 850 MB FLOW. LIMITED MOISTURE SHOULD 
MEAN ONLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 

WITH A RIDGE SHIFTING TO THE ATLANTIC COASTLINE...A RETURN FLOW OF 
GULF MOISTURE DEVELOPS SUNDAY NIGHT. GFS AND ECMWF HAVE SOME TIMING 
DIFFERENCES...BUT GENERALLY FOCUS ON MONDAY FOR THE PERIOD OF BEST 
MOISTURE AND LIFT. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS MONDAY...FOLLOWED BY A 
FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH COOLER/DRIER AIR ON TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
OVERALL FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS LOW THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS MODELS 
APPEAR TO BE HAVING A DIFFICULT TIME IN HANDLING A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW 
WITH WEAK SHORTWAVES. FOR TODAY...A BAND OF SHOWERS IN WEST TN 
ASSOCIATED WITH A ZONE OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND 500 MB 
VORT MAX IS QUICKLY MOVING EAST...BUT IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN 
SUBSTANTIALLY BEFORE IT REACHES THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU DUE TO THE 
VORT MAX LIFTING NE AND ENCOUNTERING A DRY AIR MASS OVER THE GREAT 
TN VALLEY. WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE WESTERN HALF THIS 
MORNING WITH A CHANCE ON THE NW FRINGES. IT WILL BE BREEZY TODAY 
WITH A 15-25 MPH SW WIND...BUT MOST SPOTS SHOULD STAY BELOW ADVISORY 
CRITERIA. 

BETTER PRECIP CHANCES COME WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AS THE FLOW ALOFT 
BECOMES SLIGHTLY MORE AMPLIFIED...ALLOWING POSITIVE THETA-E 
ADVECTION AT 850 MB. THE NAM SHOWS SOME WEAK INSTABILITY TO HELP 
GENERATE SOME SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON. WITH THE VERY PROGRESSIVE 
FLOW...WILL CONFINE THE CHANCE POPS TO WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. THE NAM IS FASTER TO BRING SHOWERS INTO THE AREA THAN THE
GFS...WITH GREATER INSTABILITY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. FOR NOW WILL
HAVE CHANCE POPS IN THE AFTERNOON...ALONG WITH A CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS. TEMPS WILL BE VERY WARM WITH A STRONG SW LOW LEVEL
FLOW...WITH HIGHS REACHING THE LOWER 70S IN MANY VALLEY LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...ALTHOUGH MODEL 
SOLUTIONS NOT TOO DISSIMILAR STAYED CLOSER TO THE GFS/CANADIAN ON 
FRIDAY WHILE OPTING FOR A MODEL BLEND SATURDAY. STARTED THE LONG 
TERM OUT WITH LIKELY POPS AS THERE SEEMED TO BE MODEL CONSENSUS 
CONCERNING AN AMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH DROPPING THE FROM THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS/WESTERN LAKES THURSDAY NIGHT AND ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS 
LATER FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY MORNING. AT THE SURFACE...LOW PRESSURE 
DRIVES ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST DRAGGING A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT. SOME INSTABILITY NOTED AND BLENDED A 
CHANCE OF CONVECTION INTO WESTERN SECTIONS THURSDAY EVENING. QUITE A 
BIT OF UPPER LEVEL ENERGY TRAILS THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF THE TROUGH 
FOR FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT SO MAINTAINED THE MEDIUM CHANCE POPS 
FOR SHOWERS ON FRIDAY WITH STRENGTHENING COLD AIR ADVECTION AND 
NORTHWESTERLY COMPONENT TO THE LOW LEVEL FLOW LEADING TO THE 
POSSIBILITY OF OF OROGRAPHIC SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MOST OF THE HIGH ELEVATION REGION ALONG 
THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. PRECIP WRAPS UP BY SATURDAY MORNING WITH 
A NICE WEEKEND BREAK IN THE ACTION AS RIDGING AT THE SURFACE AND 
ALOFT ALLOW FOR INCREASING SUNSHINE FROM SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY AND 
REBOUNDING TEMPERATURES. NEXT SYSTEM MAY NOT IMPACT THE REGION UNTIL 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. MODELS NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE GFS 
QUITE A BIT FASTER THAN THE ECMWF WITH A SHORT WAVE BUILDING ACROSS 
THE EASTERN U.S. STAYED CLOSER TO THE SLOWER EUROPEAN MODEL. 
HOWEVER...DUE TO UNCERTAINTY JUST APPLIED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS FOR THIS LATE PERIOD SYSTEM. 

WENT A LITTLE BELOW MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS WITH POST 
FRONTAL PRECIP ON FRIDAY. ALSO ADJUSTED MINS LOWER FOR SATURDAY 
NIGHT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF DECENT RADIATION IN DRY 
ATMOSPHERE...CALM WIND ENVIRONMENT. OF COURSE HAD TO ADJUST THE 
MAX/MIN FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT DUE TO EXPECTED SLOWER 
PROGRESSION OF EARLY WEEK SYSTEM.

MOUNTAINS IS KEEPING CLOUDY SKIES IN PLACE EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT
SHOULD ERODE QUICKLY WITH BOUNDARY LAYER MIXING AFTER SUNRISE. WITH
CLEARING SKIES IN THE WESTERN SECTIONS...TEMPS ARE FALLING INTO THE
20S...WHICH COULD CRATE SOME BLACK ICE PROBLEMS AND SLICK ROADS.
WILL CONTINUE TO COVER THIS WITH AN SPS.

HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE SURFACE TO THE UPPER LEVELS WILL BE BUILDING 
OVER THE AREA TODAY. CLEAR SKIES BY AFTERNOON WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO 
RISE INTO THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S IN MOST SPOTS. THE RIDGE AXIS 
SHIFTS TO OUR EAST TONIGHT...WITH A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW AND 
WARM ADVECTION DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT IN RESPONSE TO A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKING ACROSS THE PLAINS. SOME MID TO HIGH CLOUDS 
WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE FROM THE WEST AS THE UPPER JET NOSES INTO THE 
TN VALLEY LATE TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WEAK FRONT TRACKS THROUGH
THE AREA ON TUESDAY. WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE EXPECTED WILL KEEP
LOW CHANCES FOR TUESDAY. A FRONT AND AREA OF LOW PRESSURE MOVES
ACROSS THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE
CHANCE POPS GOING. THE SYSTEM EXITS ON THURSDAY. ANOTHER FRONT IS
EXPECTED TO TRACK THROUGH REGION ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY
BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE OF RAIN. UPPER TROUGH FOLLOWS ON FRIDAY
NIGHT AND SATURDAY. WITH THE COOLER AIRMASS BEHIND THE FRONT...MAY
SEE SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. BUT MOST
AREAS SHOULD DRY ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. HIGH PRESSURE
RETURNS PROVIDING DRY WEATHER ON SUNDAY.

325 PM EST SUN FEB 19 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED ALONG THE GEORGIA 
COAST NEAR SAVANNAH...WITH WARM TEMPS IN THE 40S EXTENDING NORTH OF 
THIS LOW ALONG AN INVERTED TROUGH UP INTO THE GREAT TN VALLEY. 
LATEST OBS INDICATE THAT RAIN HAS CHANGED OVER TO SNOW ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA...WITH 
REPORTS OF TWO INCHES OF SNOW IN WISE COUNTY AND TWO TO FIVE INCHES 
ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU NEAR JELLICO. WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE 
WINTER STORM WARNING THIS EVENING...SINCE THE WESTERN EDGE OF THIS 
PRECIP IS BACK IN MIDDLE TN AND WILL CONTINUE OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
FOR SEVERAL MORE HOURS. THE RAIN IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS SHOULD 
CHANGE OVER TO SNOW BY SUNSET AND THEREAFTER...BUT ANY ACCUMULATIONS 
SHOULD BE LIGHT DUE TO WARM GROUND AND NEAR-SURFACE TEMPS. THE MAIN 
CONCERN FOR TONIGHT IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS WILL BE THE SUB- 
FREEZING TEMPS EXPECTED AFTER MIDNIGHT...WHICH MAY CAUSE SOME AREAS 
OF BLACK ICE.

ON MONDAY...A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION...WITH DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON TUESDAY...WITH MODELS INDICATING LIMITED 
MOISTURE ALONG IT...BUT POSSIBLY ENOUGH FOR SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS. A 
BROAD SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THIS HIGH SHOULD KEEP 
TEMPS ABOVE NORMAL ON TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM 
AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY...AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WILL BE IN AN OVERALL 
UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE EXTENDED AS A SERIES OF WEAK 
FRONTAL BOUNDARIES MOVES THOUGH THE REGION. CONFIDENCE LOW ON TIMING 
AND DETAILS FOR THE SYSTEMS...BUT GENERALLY EXPECTED ONE AROUND THE 
WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME...AND ANOTHER THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY. THROUGH THIS PART OF THE EXTENDED...TEMPERATURES REMAIN 
WARM ENOUGH FOR MAINLY RAIN. COLDER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND FRIDAY/S 
SYSTEM. A THIRD FRONT MOVES THROUGH AROUND SATURDAY. THIS SYSTEM 
LOOKS QUITE DRY AND WEAK...AND FOR NOW...WILL KEEP LOW POPS CONFINED 
TO FAR NORTH AND EAST...THOUGH COULD SEE A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW OVER 
THESE AREAS IS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER 
CENTRAL GA...WITH RAIN BEING REPORTED IN THE FORECAST AREA AS TEMPS 
LINGER IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S. INFRARED SATELLITE IMAGERY 
REVEALS COLDER CLOUD TOPS OVER MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL KY ASSOCIATED 
WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH...WHICH WAS SLOWLY MOVING EAST-NORTHEAST 
TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA. DUAL POL RADAR INDICATES THAT THE 
FREEZING LEVEL IS BETWEEN 3500 AND 4000 FT MSL THIS MORNING...BUT 
THIS FREEZING LEVEL WILL LIKELY DESCEND SOME MORE BY THIS AFTERNOON 
AS THE UPPER TROUGH AND FRONTOGENETICAL FORCING INCREASES PRECIP 
RATES AND INDUCES SOME DYNAMICAL COOLING...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND MOUNTAIN RANGE. THUS...EXPECT THIS MORNING 
RAIN TO CHANGE OVER TO SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH THE CHANGE OVER OCCURRING LATER IN THE VALLEYS 
(TOWARDS SUNSET AND THEREAFTER) AS THE MOISTURE BEGINS TO EXIT THE 
REGION.

CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR THE MOST PART...BUT WILL 
PLAN TO UPDATE THIS MORNING TO REMOVE ANY MORNING WORDING...AND TO 
TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)... 
RADAR SHOWS RAIN BEGINNING TO BLOSSOM ACROSS MIDDLE TN. SATELLITE
SHOWS THE HEAD OF THE COMMA CLOUD DEVELOPING OVER AR AS THE LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM INTENSIFIES AND OCCLUDES. THE 700 MB DEFORMATION
ZONE ASSOCIATED WITH THE COMMA HEAD WILL BE TRACKING DIRECTLY OVER
OUR AREA TODAY. FRONTOGENETIC FORCING WILL PROVIDE LIFT FOR
PRECIP...WHICH MAY BE MODERATE TO HEAVY AT TIMES.

THE TRICKY PART OF THE FORECAST WILL BE TEMPERATURES...AND THIS WILL 
MAKE ALL THE DIFFERENCE IN REGARD TO SNOW AMOUNTS. WE ARE STARTING 
THE DAY QUITE WARM IN THE MID 40S TO AROUND 50 AT THE MOMENT. WITH 
THE FRONTOGENESIS ZONE DIRECTLY ACROSS THE AREA AND EVAPORATIVE 
COOLING...TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO DROP ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS THIS 
MORNING. THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS MAY BEGIN TO SEE A SNOW/RAIN MIX AS 
EARLY AS 12Z...ALTHOUGH EARLY ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE LIMITED AS 
SURFACE TEMPS WILL REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING THIS MORNING. THE CHANGE TO 
SNOW WILL ALSO BE DEPENDENT ON DYNAMIC COOLING DUE TO PRECIP 
RATES...ADDING ANOTHER DIMENSION OF DIFFICULTY TO THE FORECAST. WITH 
SUCH MARGINAL TEMPERATURE EVENTS...THERE IS OFTEN A PERIOD OF SLEET 
DURING THE RAIN-SNOW TRANSITION...AND WILL MENTION A CHANCE OF IP 
WITH CATEGORICAL RAIN AND SNOW. FALLING TEMPS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON 
WILL LOWER THE FREEZING LEVEL AND BRING THE RAIN/SNOW LINE SOUTHWARD 
INTO THE VALLEY. BY 00Z MOST PRECIP SHOULD BE SNOW AS FAR SOUTH AS 
KNOXVILLE...BUT MIDLEVEL DRYING WILL END MOST PRECIP FROM MIDNIGHT 
TO VERY EARLY MORNING FROM SW TO NE. 

AGAIN...SNOW AMOUNTS WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON THE HEIGHT OF THE 
FREEZING LEVEL AND PRECIP RATES...SO UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH AND 
ACCUMULATION RANGES WILL BE LARGE DEPENDING ON ELEVATION. HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS THAT SEE SNOW BEGIN DURING THE MORNING WILL HAVE THE 
HIGHEST AMOUNTS...WITH A RAIN/SNOW/CHANCE SLEET MIX LIMITING 
ACCUMULATIONS IN LOWER ELEVATIONS UNTIL THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING. 
THE WINTER STORM WARNING FOR SW VA AND NE TN WILL REMAIN AS IS WITH 
2-6 INCHES EXPECTED IN THOSE AREAS...LOCALLY UP TO 8 IN HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. THE NORTHERN PLATEAU WILL BE RAISED TO A WARNING...WITH 
2 TO 5 INCHES EXPECTED. THE SMOKIES WILL BE ADDED TO THE 
WARNING...MAINLY ABOVE 3000 FT...WITH AMOUNTS OF 2-5 INCHES. AN SPS 
WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE TN VALLEY TO MENTION UNDER 2 INCHES IN THE 
TRI-CITIES AREA...AND LESS THAN 1 INCH AROUND KNOXVILLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN
BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR MONDAY. A WEAK FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE
AREA ON TUESDAY. WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE EXPECTED...WILL
CONTINUE A DRY FORECAST FOR TUESDAY. A FRONT AND AREA OF LOW
PRESSURE MOVES ACROSS THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. WILL
CONTINUE THE CHANCE POPS GOING. THE SYSTEM EXITS ON THURSDAY.
ANOTHER FRONT IS EXPECTED TO TRACK THROUGH REGION ON THURSDAY NIGHT
AND FRIDAY. WITH STILL UNCERTAINTY IN STRENGTH AND TIMING...WILL
ADD ONLY LOW CHANCES FOR NOW. DRY WEATHER RETURNS ON SATURDAY.

(ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS)...THE NAM AND GFS MODELS 
REVEAL SOME SIGNIFICANT DISCREPANCIES WITH THE VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE 
OVER THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA. IN FACT...THE NAM MODEL PROFILE 
IS QUITE A BIT WARMER...ESPECIALLY AT THE 800 MB LAYER...WHICH WOULD 
RESULT IN THE POSSIBILITY OF SLEET BEFORE CHANGING OVER TO SNOW. 
WITH MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY HIGH PRECIP RATES EXPECTED OVER THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...THINK THAT SOME DYNAMICALLY COOLING COULD CAUSE 
THE RAIN TO CHANGE TO SNOW QUICKER THAN THE MODELS WOULD CURRENTLY 
SUGGEST. THIS QUICKER CHANGE OVER COULD RESULT IN WARNING-LEVEL 
SNOWFALL AMOUNTS OVER THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. SINCE THIS 
SCENARIO IS STILL UNCERTAIN...WILL CONTINUE WITH THE WINTER STORM 
WATCH FOR THE PLATEAU...BUT WILL UPGRADE TO A WARNING ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN MOUNTAINS AND START IT EARLIER (AT 
12Z). IN THE VALLEYS...WARM GROUND TEMPS FROM THE RECENT WARM 
WEATHER SHOULD COMBINE WITH AFTERNOON SURFACE TEMPS LINGERING IN THE 
UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S TO CREATE A HOSTILE ENVIRONMENT FOR ANY 
SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS UNTIL SUNDAY EVENING AS THE MOISTURE EXITS 
THE REGION. THUS...THINK THAT ANY SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN THE 
GREAT TN VALLEY SHOULD BE LIGHT BELOW 2500 FEET MSL. AS FOR THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS...WILL GENERALLY CONTINUE WITH THE PREVIOUS 
FORECAST'S SNOWFALL AMOUNTS. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SURFACE HIGH MOVING 
AWAY WILL KEEP THINGS DRY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.  WILL MOVE INTO 
AN UNSETTLE WEATHER PATTERN TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY AS A SERIES 
OF WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARIES AND SHORT WAVES SLIDES THROUGH.  MOISTURE 
AND LIFT LIMITED AND WILL KEEP POPS GENERALLY AROUND 20 TO 30.  HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR SATURDAY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS 
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG 
THE UPPER TEXAS COAST. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF MID

SLOWLY MOVES EASTWARD INTO THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY TOWARDS SUNSET. 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE NORTHERN EDGE OF THE RAIN 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT SOUTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST NC TOWARDS SUNSET...SO WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF RAIN FOR LATE THIS AFTERNOON IN THESE AREAS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
LOW PRESSURE WILL DEVELOP OVER TX AND INTENSIFY AS IT TRACKS EAST 
INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY THROUGH TODAY. MIDLEVEL CLOUDS WILL BE 
VARIABLE TODAY...MAKING FOR A TRICKY TEMPERATURE FORECAST. WILL STAY 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S IN MOST 
SPOTS. 

CONVECTION NOW OVER TX IS EXPECTED TO EXPAND INTO MS/AL/GA THIS 
AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. WITH AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED BOUNDARY 
ACROSS THAT AREA...CONVECTION TO OUR SOUTH WILL LIKELY CUT OFF A 
SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF GULF MOISTURE FEEDING INTO OUR AREA. POP AND 
QPF WILL BE CUT BACK SIGNIFICANTLY TODAY AND TONIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THIS. STILL...WE SHOULD SEE CATEGORICAL POPS WITH LIGHT PRECIP 
SPREADING INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THIS EVENING AS 500 MB 
VORTICITY ADVECTION INCREASES AND UPPER DIVERGENCE INCREASES IN THE 
ENTRANCE REGION OF A STRONG UPPER JET.

PRECIP INTENSITY WILL INCREASE AFTER 12Z SUNDAY AS THE 700 MB LOW 
TRACKS DIRECTLY OVER THE AREA. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS SHOW A 850-700 
MB FRONTOGENESIS ZONE SETTING UP ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU TO SW 
VA ON SUNDAY. THE RESULTING AGEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION WILL PROVIDE 
GOOD LIFT IN THIS AREA BETWEEN 15Z AND 21Z. WEAK COLD ADVECTION WILL 
BE REINFORCED BY MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY HIGH PRECIP RATES...WITH A 
CHANGE TO SNOW FROM NORTH TO SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY. THE NAM 
CONTINUES TO COOL THE COLUMN FASTER AND PRODUCES MORE SNOW THAN THE 
GFS. WHILE THE NAM APPEARS MORE REALISTIC...WILL NOT QUITE GO 
WHOLE-HOG WITH ITS SNOW AMOUNTS. BUT THE WATCH AREA WILL BE EXPANDED 
TO INCLUDE THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...ALL OF SW VA...AND THE NE TN 
MOUNTAINS. 2 TO 6 INCHES ARE EXPECTED IN THE WATCH AREA...WITH LOCAL 
AMOUNTS UP TO 8 POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA. FROM 
KNOXVILLE TO TRI-CITIES...A DUSTING TO 2 INCHES IS EXPECTED AT THIS 
TIME...BUT COULD BE HIGHER IF THE FASTER COOLING OF THE NAM PANS 
OUT. MIDLEVEL DRYING AS THE SYSTEM PULLS AWAY WILL BRING AN END TO 
ALL POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN 
PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR MONDAY. A WEAK FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE 
AREA ON TUESDAY. WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE EXPECTED...WILL CONTINUE A 
DRY FORECAST FOR TUESDAY.  A STRONGER FRONT AND AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
MOVES ACROSS THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE 
CHANCE POPS GOING. THE SYSTEM EXITS ON THURSDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER FRONT 
IS EXPECTED TO TRACK THE REGION ON FRIDAY. WITH STILL UNCERTAINTY IN

325 AM EST THU FEB 16 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS TODAY ALONG WITH THE ASSOCIATED WEAK 
COLD FRONT. MODELS SHOW STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE AREA THIS 
MORNING AHEAD OF FROPA. AS FRONT MOVES THROUGH TODAY...RAIN WILL 
SLOW END...BUT EXPECT AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE TO CONTINUE INTO 
THE AFTERNOON.

FOR TONIGHT...MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TRAPPED WHICH 
WILL KEEP MOST OF THE AREA CLOUDY WITH LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. THERE MAY BE SOME DRIZZLE IN THE VALLEY BUT CONFIDENCE 
NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO PUT INTO THE FORECAST.

FOR FRIDAY...SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE WILL DOMINATE WITH LOW 
CLOUDINESS ERODING...BUT BEING REPLACED BY INCREASING HIGH/MID LEVEL 
CLOUDS. ANOTHER UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY WILL BE ON TAP.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS SEEM TO BE
SLIGHTLY CLOSER ON THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE OUT OF THE
SRN PLAINS SATURDAY AND TRACK ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES SATURDAY
NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. 16/00Z ECMWF IS NOW MUCH CLOSER TO GFS SOLUTION
WHILE NAM IS A BIT SLOWER IN DEVELOPING PRECIPITATION ON SATURDAY...
BUT HAS A SIMILAR TRACK. MODERATE TO STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT PLUS
UPSLOPE SE WINDS WILL CREATE PLENTY OF LIFT...SO I CHOSE TO BUMP
POPS UP TO LIKELY BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS SRN PARTS OF THE
FORECAST AREA. HIGH POPS JUSTIFIED FOR SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN POPS
AND QPF DECREASE ON SUNDAY.

ACTUAL TRACK COULD DRAW COLDER AIR INTO SW VA AND NE TN ON SUNDAY
WITH POTENTIAL FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS. THIS BEARS WATCHING...BUT FOR
NOW I WORDED AS BOTH RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS. MONDAY LOOKS DRY WITH
SEASONAL HIGHS AS A LARGE UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 

UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ELONGATED SURFACE LOW BRING ANOTHER CHANCE
OF SHOWERS BY TUESDAY NIGHT THRU WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT TOO SOON TO 
GO MORE THAN SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. GFSX MOS TEMPS
WERE GENERALLY CONSISTENT FROM 12Z TO 00Z RUNS...AND WERE FOLLOWED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID 
ATLANTIC STATES...WITH A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. A WARM FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM WILL MOVE NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE DEEP SOUTH TONIGHT...AND 
INTO SOUTHEAST TN TOWARDS SUNRISE ON THURSDAY MORNING. SHOWERS AHEAD 
OF THIS WARM FRONT SHOULD BEGIN TO AFFECT SOUTHEAST TN AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...AND WILL THEN SPREAD NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE LOCAL AIR MASS WILL REMAIN FAIRLY STABLE 
TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING...SO WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION ONLY 
SHOWERS WITH THIS SYSTEM. WITH THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS 
SYSTEM EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY 18Z...WILL 
MENTION THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN SHOWERS IN THE MORNING WITH ONLY 
SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN EXPECTED BEHIND THE FRONT DURING THE AFTERNOON. 
CLOUDS SHOULD BE SLOW TO DIMINISH THURSDAY NIGHT...AS A MID-LEVEL 
INVERSION DEVELOPS OVER THE FORECAST AREA IN THE ZONAL UPPER-LEVEL 
FLOW. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH TRANQUIL CONDITIONS EXPECTED. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO AN 
EARLY PERIOD ECMWF/BLEND WHICH DEPICTS A MOIST WEEKEND. BOTH THE 
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN BRANCHES OF THE JET STREAM WILL BE ACTIVE 
DRIVING A SURFACE LOW AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND OFFSHORE FROM 12Z SATURDAY TO 12Z SUNDAY WHILE A 
NORTHWESTERN GULF LOW BUILDS NORTHEAST TO THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC 
COAST DURING THE SAME PERIOD. EDGED PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION UP 
A TAD FOR THIS EVENT AREA WIDE. AIRMASS CHILLS JUST ENOUGH LATE 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING TO ADD A SNOW SHOWER ON THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES. HIGHEST POPS WILL BE SATURDAY NIGHT BUT HAD 
TO EXTEND CHANCE POPS ON SUNDAY WITH SLOW SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM 
EXIT. A NICE RIDGE WILL ALLOW FOR A RETURN TO SUNSHINE ON MONDAY 
WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM ADVANCING THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY EARLY 
ON TUESDAY IN TIME TO BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER TO THE AREA 
BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AS WARM AND MOIST AIR STREAM NORTH OFF THE 
GULF. ASSOCIATED COLD MOVES THROUGH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY. MODELS

309 AM EST WED FEB 15 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...MAIN CONCERN THIS 
MORNING IS POTENTIAL OF DENSE FOG. CURRENTLY...ONLY DENSE FOG 
REPORTED IS AT ANDREWS...NC. HOWEVER...LOW LEVEL AIRMASS IS QUITE 
MOIST AND WINDS ARE GENERALLY CALM WITH A WET GROUND. SATELLITE 
SHOWS SOME BREAKS DEVELOPING IN LOW CLOUD DECK WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR 
SOME RADIATIONAL DENSE FOG TO DEVELOP. WILL CONTINUE WITH DENSE FOG 
ADVISORY WITH PATCHY WORDING.

FOG AND LOW CLOUDS WILL DISSIPATE THIS MORNING...BUT PLENTY OF HIGH 
AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. NEXT 
SHORT-WAVE AND ASSOCIATED WEAK COLD FRONT/BOUNDARY WILL MOVE ACROSS 
LATE TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. WILL CALL FOR CATEGORICAL POPS FOR 
THURSDAY. INSTABIBILITY NONE EXISTENT...SO ONLY RAIN ANTICIPATED. 
MAIN FORCING WILL COME FROM JET DYNAMICS...FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING 
ALONG BOUNDARY...AND ISENTROPIC LIFT.

SOME WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT 
SHOWERS...POSSIBLY MIXED WITH SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT.

FOLLOWED GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES CLOSELY.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS START OUT CONSISTENT 
FOR FRIDAY AS UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL BEHIND THURSDAY SYSTEM. 
SURFACE HIGH SETTLING SOUTHWARD FROM THE OHIO VALLEY WILL BRING WEAK 
COLD AIR ADVECTION...ESPECIALLY TO SW VA AND NE TIP OF TN. THIS MADE 
COOLER NAM MOS HIGHS A BETTER CHOICE FOR SW VA AND NE TN...AND GFS 
OR A BLEND BEST ELSEWHERE.

MODELS THEN START TO DIVERGE ON THE PATTERN FROM SATURDAY INTO 
TUESDAY...BASICALLY WITH SHORTWAVE ENERGY IN THE SRN STREAM COMING 
FROM THE SRN PLAINS. THE ECMWF SEEMS TO BE THE ONLY MODEL TRENDING 
DRIER (KEEPING THE ENERGY MOSTLY TO OUR SOUTH ACROSS GULF COAST 
STATES)...WHILE GFS/SREF/CMC ALL SUPPORT KEEPING POPS IN FOR 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY. OPTED TO WAIT FOR SOME BETTER 
CONTINUITY BEFORE GOING ANYWHERE NEAR LIKELY POPS. I DID INCREASE 
POPS SLIGHTLY TO MESH BETTER WITH NWS NEIGHBORS GRIDS.

OTHERWISE...PATTERN SHOULD TREND BACK TO A BUILDING UPPER RIDGE...AT 
LEAST BRIEFLY FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. KEPT TUESDAY DRY TO START 
AND THEN ADDED LOW POPS FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON INTO TUESDAY NIGHT. 
GFSX MOS TEMPS INCONSISTENT FROM 14/12Z TO 15/00Z RUN...SO MINOR 
TWEAKS JUST AS NEEDED FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKING 
OUT OF THE REGION TONIGHT. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES FOR THE EVENING HOURS. NO WINTER WEATHER IS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT. PRECIPITATION IS EXPECTED TO EXIT THE AREA BEFORE THE 
COOLER TEMPERATURES ARRIVE. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY 
WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO 
BE IN DECENT AGREEMENT EARLY ON...BUT BY THE WEEKEND THINGS MORE 
HAZY GIVEN POOR RUN TO RUN CONTINUITY AND LACK OF MODEL AGREEMENT.  

A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH THE REGION LATE WED NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY.  LOOKING MORE LIKE WE MAY BE CAUGHT BETWEEN BETTER 
DYNAMICS TO OUR NORTH AND BETTER MOISTURE TO OUR SOUTH...WITH LESS 
PRECIP OVER OUR AREA.  STILL APPEARS TO WARRANT AT LEAST LIKELY POPS 
WED NIGHT/EARLY THU.  SHOULD BE AN ALL LIQUID PRECIP EVENT AS TEMPS 
WILL BE MILD.  APPEARS THERE IS SOME POTENTIAL FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES 
AND STRONG WINDS IN THE NORMALLY AFFECTED HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS AND 
FOOTHILLS FOR A BRIEF PERIOD WED NIGHT/EARLY THU. LATER SHIFTS MAY 
NEED TO ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY.  WILL MENTION IN HWO.    

EXPECT DRY WEATHER FRIDAY...THEN THE DETAILS OF THIS WEEKEND LOOK 
VERY UNCERTAIN AND FORECAST CONFIDENCE WELL BELOW AVERAGE.  MODELS 
COMING INTO SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT THAT THERE WILL BE A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKING BY TO OUR SOUTH...AND PRECIP APPEARING MORE 
LIKELY AT SOME POINT DURING THE WEEKEND. HOWEVER TIMING AND EXACT 
TRACK STILL QUITE UNCERTAIN. COULD BE SOME POTENTIAL FOR SNOW FOR 
OUR AREA...ESPECIALLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT THIS POTENTIAL VERY 
SENSITIVE TO THE DETAILS WHICH ARE STILL QUITE UNCERTAIN AT THIS 
POINT.  FOR NOW WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS MAINLY SAT NIGHT AND SUNDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NEXT AREA OF PRECIPITATION OVER
MIDDLE TN AND NE AL WILL BE MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS
MORNING. HOWEVER...SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...DUAL POL RADAR PRODUCTS
AND PHONE CALLS MADE REVEAL THE THREAT OF WINTRY MIX HAS DECREASED. 
ENOUGH WARMING HAS OCCURED TO DROP THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR
MARION...SEQUATCHIE...HAMILTON AND BRADLEY COUNTIES WITH THE EARLY
MORNING FORECAST. KEPT THE REST OF THE ADVISORY GOING THROUGH 10 AM
PER COORDINATION WITH FFC AND GSP...ALTHO I DID DOWNPLAY SNOW AND
ICE ACCUMULATIONS. SURFACE TEMPS PROBABLY TOO WARM IN THE ADVISORY
AREA FOR ANY FREEZING RAIN SO WEATHER TYPE CHANGED TO RAIN WITH
SOME SNOW OR SLEET EARLY. MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION ENDS THIS
AFTERNOON...BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY GET
TRAPPED. THIS COULD KEEP THE CLOUDS IN LONGER AND ALSO SUPPORTS
PATCHY DRIZZLE AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS.

UNDERCUT GFS MOS HIGHS FOR TODAY...THEN MINS TONIGHT ARE DEPENDENT
ON HOW MUCH CLOUDS DECREASE...SO I BLENDED BETWEEN THE DIFFERING
NAM AND GFS MOS MINS FOR NOW.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN 
REASONABLE AGREEMENT DURING THE ACTIVE EXTENDED PERIODS. MODELS SHOW 
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM ENERGY PHASING ACROSS THE PLAIN STATES 
THEN MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY. 
WIDESPREAD RAIN IS ANTICIPATED. LITTLE IF ANY INSTABILITY NOTED WITH 
THE SYSTEM. MAIN LIFT IS FRONT FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING AND ISENTROPIC 
LIFT.

UPPER FLOW REMAIN ZONAL FOR FRIDAY WITH SURFACE RIDGING. ANOTHER 
NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WITH 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY. AT THE 
SAME TIME...A SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE MOVING FROM THE NORTHERN 
MEXICO/TEXAS WILL PRODUCE CYCLO-GENESIS JUST OFF THE SOUTHEAST TEXAS 
COAST SATURDAY. MODELS SHOW THE SURFACE LOW MOVING EAST OR EAST 
NORTHEAST ACROSS FAR SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY. FAIRLY STRONG SYNOPTIC FORCING WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION. VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE 
WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR A MIXTURE OF RAIN/SNOW OR ALL SNOW. WILL NEED 
TO WATCH THE EXACT PATH OF THE SURFACE LOW AND HOW COLD AIR GETS 
PULLED INTO THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE THE SYSTEM MOVES IN.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MEX MOS EXCEPT FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY 
DUE TO EXPECTED MIXED BAG OF PRECIPITATION.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CHILLY TEMPS THIS MORNING
WITH COLD SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS THE REGION...AND THIS COLD AIR MASS
LOOKS TO CAUSE A BRIEF PERIOD OF WINTRY MIXED PCPN LATE TONIGHT
JUST PAST DAYBREAK TUESDAY. LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING OVER LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION WILL PROVIDE ISENTROPIC LIFT...WITH AN
AREA OF MOSTLY RAIN MOVING INTO SE TN GENERALLY AFTER 06Z TUESDAY.
HOWEVER...MODEL AND BUFKIT SOUNDINGS SUGGEST COLD AIR SHOULD GET
TRAPPED IN VALLEYS OF POLK COUNTY INTO CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES
OF SW NC. THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR VALLEYS OF HIGHER TERRAIN IN MONROE
COUNTY. THERE IS A BRIEF PERIOD WHERE A LIGHT SNOW AND/OR ICE
ACCUMULATION COULD OCCUR WITH AN INCH OR SO OF SNOW AND PERHAPS UP
TO 1/10 INCH OF ICE. THUS I OPTED TO ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY FOR THOSE AREAS...FROM 07Z TO 15Z TUESDAY...WITH MAINLY
RAIN AFTER THAT TIME. MODELS SHOW CONSISTENCY AND IN LINE WITH
WINTER WEATHER DESK GRAPHIC FOR DAY ONE. THANKS TO GSP AND FFC FOR
COORDINATION.

MOST FORECAST GRID CHANGES WERE TO COVER THE ADVISORY PERIOD...BUT 
POPS WERE ALSO INCREASED ON TUESDAY. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS 
MAX AND MIN TEMP GRIDS...WHICH WERE A BIT CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM 
MOS NUMBERS. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...PRECIPITATION MOVES
OUT TUESDAY NIGHT WITH MOSTLY RAIN ALTHOUGH A LITTLE SNOW POSSIBLE
AFTER MIDNIGHT NORTHEAST AS TEMPERATURES COOL INTO THE LOWER 30S.
NO SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION EXPECTED. FAST MOVING HIGH PRESSURE
AREA SLIDES ACROSS WEDNESDAY AND LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL WARM
TEMPERATURES BACK ABOVE NORMAL. ANOTHER FAST MOVING SYSTEM OVER THE
PLAINS WEDNESDAY TRACKS INTO THE MS VALLEY AND TOWARD THE GREAT
LAKES WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SHOWERS SPREAD INTO THE TN VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY THURSDAY MORNING AHEAD OF A WARM FRONT.
SOUTHERLY FLOW SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES UP WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
THURSDAY. POSSIBLY INSTABILITY WILL BE GREAT ENOUGH FOR A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS TOO AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT DURING THE DAY THURSDAY.
WITH TIMING UNCERTAINTY OF THE FRONT WILL LEAVE OUT THUNDER FOR
NOW. DECREASING SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT. FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY
FORECAST AREA STAYS IN MEAN TROUGH WITH WEATHER SYSTEMS STAYING
NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE REGION ALTHOUGH ECMWF SHOWS A SOUTHERN
SYSTEM BRUSHING OVER THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT WILL KEEP FORECAST
AREA DRY WITH NEAR SEASONAL TEMPERATURES FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

425 AM EST MON FEB 13 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CHILLY TEMPS THIS MORNING
WITH COLD SURFACE RIDGE ACROSS THE REGION...AND THIS COLD AIR MASS
LOOKS TO CAUSE A BRIEF PERIOD OF WINTRY MIXED PCPN LATE TONIGHT
JUST PAST DAYBREAK TUESDAY. LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING OVER LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION WILL PROVIDE ISENTROPIC LIFT...WITH AN
AREA OF MOSTLY RAIN MOVING INTO SE TN GENERALLY AFTER 06Z TUESDAY.
HOWEVER...MODEL AND BUFKIT SOUNDINGS SUGGEST COLD AIR SHOULD GET
TRAPPED IN VALLEYS OF POLK COUNTY INTO CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES
OF SW NC. THIS IS ALSO TRUE FOR VALLEYS OF HIGHER TERRAIN IN MONROE
COUNTY. THERE IS A BRIEF PERIOD WHERE A LIGHT SNOW AND/OR ICE
ACCUMULATION COULD OCCUR WITH AN INCH OR SO OF SNOW AND PERHAPS UP
TO 1/10 INCH OF ICE. THUS I OPTED TO ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY FOR THOSE AREAS...FROM 07Z TO 15Z TUESDAY...WITH MAINLY
RAIN AFTER THAT TIME. MODELS SHOW CONSISTENCY AND IN LINE WITH
WINTER WEATHER DESK GRAPHIC FOR DAY ONE. THANKS TO GSP AND FFC FOR
COORDINATION.

MOST FORECAST GRID CHANGES WERE TO COVER THE ADVISORY PERIOD...BUT 
POPS WERE ALSO INCREASED ON TUESDAY. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS 
MAX AND MIN TEMP GRIDS...WHICH WERE A BIT CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM 
MOS NUMBERS. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...PRECIPITATION MOVES
OUT TUESDAY NIGHT WITH MOSTLY RAIN ALTHOUGH A LITTLE SNOW POSSIBLE
AFTER MIDNIGHT NORTHEAST AS TEMPERATURES COOL INTO THE LOWER 30S.
NO SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION EXPECTED. FAST MOVING HIGH PRESSURE
AREA SLIDES ACROSS WEDNESDAY AND LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL WARM
TEMPERATURES BACK ABOVE NORMAL. ANOTHER FAST MOVING SYSTEM OVER THE
PLAINS WEDNESDAY TRACKS INTO THE MS VALLEY AND TOWARD THE GREAT
LAKES WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SHOWERS SPREAD INTO THE TN VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY THURSDAY MORNING AHEAD OF A WARM FRONT.
SOUTHERLY FLOW SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES UP WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
THURSDAY. POSSIBLY INSTABILITY WILL BE GREAT ENOUGH FOR A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS TOO AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT DURING THE DAY THURSDAY.
WITH TIMING UNCERTAINTY OF THE FRONT WILL LEAVE OUT THUNDER FOR
NOW. DECREASING SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT. FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY
FORECAST AREA STAYS IN MEAN TROUGH WITH WEATHER SYSTEMS STAYING
NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE REGION ALTHOUGH ECMWF SHOWS A SOUTHERN
SYSTEM BRUSHING OVER THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT WILL KEEP FORECAST
AREA DRY WITH NEAR SEASONAL TEMPERATURES FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

ONSET PRECIPITATION. WARM LAYER AT H85 APPEARS TO MOVE NE FAST SO

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PESKY LINGERING LOW CLOUDS AND 
FLURRIES OVER MAINLY SW VA AND NE TN THIS MORNING...SHOULD GRADUALLY 
DISSIPATE BY MID MORNING. NOT LIKELY TO SEE ANY MORE SNOW ACCUMS...
SO LET WINTER WX ADVISORY EXPIRE FOR LEE AND WISE COUNTIES AT 4AM.
ALSO...WINDS DIMINISHED A GOOD DEAL OVERNIGHT...PLUS CLOUD COVER TO 
KEEP WIND CHILL VALUES AROUND 5 DEGREES ABOVE ZERO OR HIGHER. SO...
OPTED TO CANCEL OUR WIND CHILL ADVISORY WHICH HAD RUN THRU 9AM. I 
WILL MENTION WIND CHILLS FOR EARLY TODAY IN OUR HWO PRODUCT. 

OTHERWISE...COLD SURFACE RIDGE SETTLES OVER SE STATES TODAY AND
TONIGHT. NOT THINKING THERE WILL BE MUCH SIGNIFICANT SNOW
COVER...BUT I UNDERCUT GFS MOS SLIGHTLY FOR HIGHS. MINS TONIGHT
COULD BE CHILLY AS SURFACE RIDGE SETTLES RIGHT ACROSS THE SRN
APPALACHIANS. THIS MADE THE COLDER GFS MOS MINS A BETTER CHOICE.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD SURFACE RIDGE OVER
FORECAST AREA BEGINS TO MODERATE MONDAY ALTHOUGH DRY AIR MASS WILL
KEEP DEW POINTS IN THE TEENS. HIGHS ABOUT 10 DEGREES WARMER THAN
TODAY. CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE IN THE AFTERNOON AS NEXT SYSTEM
DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND SPREADS MOISTURE NE. MONDAY
NIGHT CLOUDS WILL THICKEN AND LOWER WITH PRECIPITATION SPREADING
INTO THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. TEMPERATURES WILL DROP TO
NEAR FREEZING AS PRECIPITATION BEGINS. A MIXTURE OF PRECIPITATION
TYPES IS POSSIBLE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING AS THE SYSTEM
MOVES EAST. A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF ICING AND AN INCH OR SO OF SNOW IS
POSSIBLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY BEFORE THE ATMOSPHERE WARMS
AND PRECIPITATION CHANGES TO ALL RAIN. WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS SYSTEM IN
THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. FRONTAL BOUNDARY WITH THIS SYSTEM
STAYS ALONG THE GULF COAST AND THEN REINFORCING HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDS BACK OVER THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY.
BREAK IS ONLY TEMPORARY AS A SECOND STRONGER SYSTEM BRINGS SHOWERS

.DISCUSSION...SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE THIS AFTERNOON.
SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE PERSISTENT ACROSS UPSLOPE AREAS. STRONG 
NORTHWEST WINDS WILL PERSIST AND TEMPERATURES WILL DROP THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR (DUAL POL PRODUCTS) 
INDICATE MOSTLY LIGHT SNOW AS PRECIPITATION TYPE THIS MORNING...WITH 
SURFACE OBSERVATIONS OVER SW VA AND NRN PLATEAU NORTH INTO SE KY 
SUPPORTING THIS. CENTRAL VALLEY TEMPS SOUTHWARD STILL UPPER 30S TO 
LOWER 40S SO POSSIBLY A LITTLE MIX WITH LIGHT RAIN FOR A FEW MORE 
HOURS. EXPECT SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS MAY HAVE ALREADY 
OCCURRED OVER SW VA AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF NRN AND SMOKY 
MTNS...PLUS AT LEAST A DUSTING TO HALF AN INCH OVER NRN PLATEAU. 

STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION KICKS IN LATER THIS MORNING WITH BRISK NW 
UPSLOPE FLOW WINDS. LAPSE RATES STEEPEN AND POSITIVE CAPES UP TO 60 
J/KG...SO OUR WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY LOOKS ON TRACK WITH NO CHANGES 
MADE AT THIS TIME. WIND ADVISORY SPEEDS MAY BE ONLY MARGINALLY 
REACHED IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS...BUT NO PROBLEM FOR HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. TEMPERATURES CAN ONLY GO DOWN TODAY...SO FORECAST GRIDS 
WILL REFLECT THIS...WHILE BRISK NW WINDS MAKE IT REALLY FEEL LIKE 
WINTER. DECREASING CLOUDS OR CLEARING TONIGHT AND QUITE COLD. 

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...COLD ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE 
SETTLES OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES SUNDAY WITH HIGHS ONLY IN THE 
30S...SOME 10 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. DEW POINTS VERY LOW IN THE 
SINGLE DIGITS. THEN ANOTHER COLD NIGHT WITH LOWS ONCE AGAIN IN THE 
TEENS AS SURFACE HIGH BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST. LOW PRESSURE IN TEXAS 
ALONG OLD SURFACE BOUNDARY MOVES INTO LOWER MS VALLEY MONDAY. 
MOISTURE STREAMS NORTH INTO THE CENTRAL STATES WITH PRECIPITATION 
DEVELOPING WITH SNOW IN THE PLAINS AND RAIN AND OR FREEZING 
PRECIPITATION MOVING INTO OK AND AR. ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABOUT 10 DEGREES WARMER AS WINDS SHIFT TO THE 
SOUTH. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE DURING THE AFTERNOON. DEW POINTS WILL 
BEGIN TO COME UP LATE MONDAY.

MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS MOVES INTO THE MS
AND TN VALLEYS. TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY DROP BELOW FREEZING MONDAY
EVENING WITH DRY AIR MASS AND DIURNAL COOLING. LATER ATMOSPHERE
SLOWLY MOISTEN UPS AND TEMPERATURES BECOME STEADY WITH SKIES CLOUDY.
OVERRUNNING NORTH OF SOUTHERN FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL CAUSE
PRECIPITATION TO DEVELOP BY MORNING. MODEL SOUNDINGS HINT THAT
SOME LOCATIONS IN SOUTHEAST TN AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU MAY HAVE
WARM AIR ALOFT WITH TEMPERATURES BELOW FREEZING TUESDAY MORNING FOR
SOME FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET BEFORE TEMPERATURES WARM ABOVE FREEZING
AND PRECIPITATION CHANGES TO ALL RAIN. WILL HAVE SNOW AND RAIN
MIXTURE IN FORECAST FOR NOW BUT MAY NEED TO ADD A WINTERY MIX IN
LATER UPDATES. SNOW EARLY TUESDAY WILL CHANGE TO ALL RAIN BY ABOUT
18Z BUT SOME AREAS MAY HAVE LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS TUESDAY MORNING.
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY SHOWERS LINGER MOSTLY RAIN BUT SNOW
POSSIBLE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY A NEW
DEVELOPING SYSTEM IN THE MS VALLEY SPREADS PRECIPITATION INTO THE
FORECAST AREA. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE WARMER AND BRING MOSTLY RAIN.
SHOWERS CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
254 PM EST FRI FEB 10 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...RAPID PATTERN CHANGES 
TONIGHT. SHORT WAVE OVER OK MOVES QUICKLY THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST. 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE DEEPENS NEAR THE OUTER BANKS EARLY SATURDAY. 
STRONG JET SEGMENT IN THE MEAN UPPER TROUGH DIGS SE INTO THE TN 
VALLEY. LARGE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AREA SINKS INTO THE UPPER 
PLAINS. ISENTROPIC LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH SHORT WAVE HAS BEEN WORKING 
OVER THE DRY LOW LEVELS OVER THE EAST TENNESSEE VALLEY TODAY. THIS 
ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE INTO TONIGHT. THE RESIDENT AIR MASS WILL 
CONTINUE TO FILL WITH VIRGA AND MOISTEN FROM ALOFT BEFORE 
PRECIPITATION REACHES THE SURFACE THIS EVENING. THE PRECIPITATION 
WILL BECOME MIXED AND EARLY ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE SPARSE. THE AXIS 
OF THE SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH LATER THIS EVENING FOLLOWED BY A 
DRAMATIC FALL IN THE FREEZING LEVEL. GOOD AVAILABLE MOISTURE WILL 
CONTINUE UNTIL COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE AROUND DAY BREAK SATURDAY. LIGHT 
SYNOPTIC SNOWFALL ANTICIPATED OVERNIGHT. PRESSURE GRADIENT VERY 
TIGHT BEHIND COLD FRONT. NORTHWEST WINDS WILL INCREASE RAPIDLY AND 
CONTINUE MUCH OF THE DAY. COLD AIR ADVECTION VERY STRONG. 
TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE LITTLE AND LIKELY FALL IN THE AFTERNOON. 
SCATTERED INSTABILITY SNOW SHOWERS AND UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS WILL 
BECOME FAVORABLE WITH TYPICAL LIMITED MOISTURE. OCCASIONAL 
CONVERGENT BANDS OF STRONGER SNOW BURST POSSIBLE WITH INCREASED 
LAPSE RATES. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN RAPIDLY SO BEST NW FLOW AND 
CYCLONIC CURVATURE LOSES CHARACTER INTO SAT EVENING. COLD AIR 
ADVECTION CONTINUES SATURDAY NIGHT AND WINDS STAY UP SUFFICIENTLY TO 
HINT AT POSSIBLE WIND CHILL ADVISORY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
FOR SUNDAY MORNING. LIQUID TO SNOW RATIOS AROUND 1:40 NEAR EVENT END 
COULD ALLOW FOR DECENT ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. EVENT TOTAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL VARY GREATLY 
ACROSS THE REGION. TEMPERATURES IN THE TEENS WILL BE WIDESPREAD. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE LARGE SCALE UPPER LEVEL 
POLAR LOW OVER EASTERN CANADA AND THE SUBTROPICAL HIGH OVER THE 
CARIBBEAN REMAIN ANCHORED IN PLACE THROUGH THIS PART OF THE 
FORECAST...INDUCING A BUSY FLOW OVER THE AREA.  

UPPER SHORT WAVE TROUGH PASSAGES LOOK TO BE TIMED AROUND TUESDAY AND 
AGAIN NEAR THE END OF THE FORECAST.

AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS FORECAST...COLD HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING 
INTO THE REGION. ON MONDAY MOISTURE WILL BE STREAMING INTO THE AREA 
ALOFT...BUT SURFACE DEW POINTS WILL START OUT THE DAY VERY LOW.  IT 
IS LIKELY THAT VIRGA WILL BE SEEN ON MONDAY AS IT WILL TAKE A WHILE 
FOR THE LOWER TROPOSPHERE TO MOISTEN UP.  TRICKY FORECAST FOR MONDAY 
NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY...AS WARM ADVECTION WILL BE ON-GOING...BUT 
LIFT WILL BE COOLING THE AIR MASS...SO PRECIP WILL LIKELY BE A 
MIXTURE OF RAIN/SNOW AT DIFFERENT TIMES...DEPENDING ON TIMING OF 
WARMING TO CHANGE TO RAIN...BUT THEN MAX LIFT POSSIBLY CHANGING 
TEMPORARILY BACK TO SNOW.  ONCE LIFT MOVES ON THROUGH...THEN AIR 
MASS CAN CONTINUE TO WARM AND MOST PRECIP WILL STAY RAIN.  AT 
PRESENT...LOOKS LIKE BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON...MOST OF THE AREA WOULD 
BE CHANGED TO RAIN.

FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK COLD AIR STAYS NORTH AND PRECIP SHOULD BE 
MAINLY LIQUID...EVEN IN THE MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
REMAINS OVER THE AREAS TONIGHT. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WITH TEMPERATURES 
AT OR BELOW NORMAL. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST ON FRIDAY. A 
MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE APPROACHES FROM THE SW. CLOUD COVER INCREASES 
AND LOWERS THROUGH THE DAY. PATCHES OF RAIN WILL ADVANCE INTO THE 
AREA BY LATE AFTERNOON. THE FREEZING LEVEL AT THE BEGINNING OF THE 
PRECIPITATION EVENT WILL BE BETWEEN 3500 TO 4000 FEET. THE SHORT 
WAVE WILL MOVE QUICKLY EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE MRX CWA. 
A STRONG UPPER JET WILL QUICKLY FOLLOW FROM THE NW. THE FREEZING 
LEVEL WILL LOWER FRIDAY NIGHT AND THE RAIN WILL CHANGE TO MOSTLY 
SNOW BY SATURDAY MORNING. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE IS BECOMING 
FAVORABLE FOR LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY 
BY SATURDAY MORNING. THE AVAILABLE MOISTURE...ESPECIALLY IN THE SNOW 
GROWTH REGION IS MARGINAL AND QUESTIONABLE AT THIS TIME. CONFIDENCE 
IS RISING FOR A REQUIREMENT FOR A SNOW ADVISORY ACROSS SW VA AND THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS OF TENNESSEE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION ON SATURDAY WILL KEEP 
TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL. UPSLOPE AND SCATTERED INSTABILITY 
SNOW SHOWERS WILL PERSIST MUCH OF THE DAY BUT LIMITED MOISTURE WILL 
HOLD DOWN SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS. H85 TEMPS WILL RANGE FROM -10 
TO -15C AND SURFACE TEMPERATURES IN THE TEENS WILL BE COMMON SUNDAY 
MORNING.   

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING THE 
REGION BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. A FRONT IS 
EXPECTING TO MOVE INTO THE AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. WILL    
KEEP THE LOW POPS GOING.  MAY SEE SNOW ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY 
MORNING MORNING WITH THE BEST CHANCE FOR SNOW ACCUMULATION ACROSS 
THE HIGHER ELEVATION.  WILL GO WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY FOR 
NOW. ANOTHER FRONT ENTERS THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. 
WILL ADD CHANCE POPS FOR RAIN. IT SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL 
RAIN. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

TEMPERATURES A BIT BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS TODAY.  DRY AIR MOVING IN 
WILL ALLOW FOR DECREASING CLOUDS THIS AFTERNOON.  OVERALL...SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR A QUIET AND UNEVENTFUL SHORT TERM. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN 
DECENT AGREEMENT OVERALL. FORECAST CONFIDENCE FALLS OFF SOMEWHAT FOR

NOT BEEN VERY GOOD.  

UPPER TROUGH WILL DIG IN EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH A COLD FRONT 
PUSHING THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT...USHERING IN A SHOT OF MUCH 
COLDER AIR FOR THE WEEKEND.  MOISTURE LOOKS SOMEWHAT LIMITED WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...BUT STILL LOOKS LIKE LIKELY POPS ARE WARRANTED FRIDAY 
NIGHT AT LEAST NORTH AND CENTRAL ZONES.  WILL CARRY LOW POPS FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AS THIS SYSTEM APPROACHES...AND THIS SHOULD BE MAINLY RAIN 
DUE TO WARM BOUNDARY LAYER...ALTHOUGH MAY SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS 
OVER THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS.  SNOW SHOWERS HIGHER ELEVATIONS FRIDAY 
NIGHT...AND VALLEYS MAY SEE A CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS AS WELL AS 
BOUNDARY LAYER COOLS.  SOME SNOW SHOWERS WILL LINGER INTO SATURDAY 
MAINLY NORTHERN HALF ESPECIALLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN NORTHWEST FLOW 
AS COLDER AIR PUSHES IN.  LOOKS LIKE AT LEAST HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
COULD PICK UP SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS...SO WILL MENTION IN HWO.  

HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN WITH DRY WEATHER SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY...THEN THINGS MORE MUDDLED FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.  LATEST 
RUNS SEEM TO LEAN TOWARD A WEAK SYSTEM AROUND TUESDAY...WITH 
WEDNESDAY DRIER.  HOWEVER...GIVEN UNCERTAINTY THAT FAR OUT AND WITH 
THE LACK OF RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY WILL KEEP LOW POPS FOR THE ENTIRE

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID 
MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING OFF THE CAROLINA COAST. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEALING A STRONG MID-LEVEL 
INVERSION CONTINUING OVER THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. THUS...THINK 
THESE CLOUDS WILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME DISSIPATING OVERNIGHT...SO WILL 
PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST TO MENTION MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND TO 
REMOVE ANY EVENING PRECIP WORDING. TEMPS AND WINDS FOR TONIGHT 
APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK...SO WILL NOT PLAN TO CHANGE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER FLOW BECOMES ZONAL IN 
WAKE OF EXITING SHORT WAVE. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO
THE AREA FROM THE WEST. WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION THROUGH MID DAY 
THURSDAY. LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS FLURRIES POSSIBLE ACROSS NE AREA THIS 
EVENING. OTHERWISE...AIRMASS DRIES OUT RAPIDLY WITH SOME ADVANCING 
CIRRUS ON THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FROM THE START OF 
THIS PERIOD THROUGH THE WEEKEND...THE AREA IS GENERALLY UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF THE LARGE UPPER TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA...AND EVEN 
INTO NEXT WEEK...WE ARE IN THE FAST FLOW BETWEEN THAT TROUGH AND THE 
SUBTROPICAL HIGH OVER THE CARIBBEAN.  

AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE COVERS THE AREA AT THE START OF THE 
PERIOD...THE TIMING OF THE COLD FRONT PASSAGE STILL LOOKS LIKE 
FRIDAY NIGHT...FOLLOWED BY THE FILLING OF EVEN HIGHER PRESSURE INTO 
THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND.  BY MONDAY...RETURN FLOW STARTS UP AS 
THE HIGH MOVES EAST OF THE AREA. THE LAST SYSTEM AROUND THE MIDDLE
OF NEXT WEEK SEEMS HIGHLY VARIABLE IN THE MODELS...WITH RESPECT TO
ITS TIMING AND INTENSITY. IT DOES APPEAR THAT IN THE ADVANCE OF
THIS NEXT SYSTEM THAT RELATIVELY HIGH DEW POINTS WILL SURGE INTO
THE AREA FROM THE GULF...SO WILL HAVE TO LOOK FOR THE THUNDERSTORMS
WITH THAT SYSTEM...FOR NOW WILL KEEP IT SHOWERS.

IN THE MEANTIME...THE SYSTEM FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...HAVE PUT IN 
LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE GRIDS...MAINLY IN THE NORTHEAST
AND FROM THE SMOKIES NORTHWARD IN THE MOUNTAINS...WITH TOTAL
AMOUNTS FOR NOW MAINLY BELOW ONE INCH. WILL HAVE TO SEE IF THIS
SYSTEM GETS BETTER ORGANIZED AS IT GETS CLOSER. FOR THE NEXT SYSTEM
MONDAY NIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY...MAY HAVE A MIX INITIALLY IN THE
NORTHEAST...BUT WARMER AIR SHOULD CHANGE IT ALL OVER TO RAIN.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK SHORT WAVE...FOLLOWED BY A 
TROUGH AXIS WILL BRING ISOLATED TO SCATTERED LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE SHORT TERM.  BEST CHANCE OF 
PRECIP WILL BE OVER NORTHERN LOCATIONS.  A FEW FLURRIES OR LIGHT 
SNOW IS POSSIBLE EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT SHOULD QUICKLY SWITCH TO 
RAIN OVER MOST LOCATIONS.  A FEW SHOWERS WILL LINGER OVER NORTHERN 
AND EASTERN AREAS THIS EVENING WITH PRECIP CHANGING TO SNOW OVER 
HIGHER TERRAIN POSSIBLE.  OVERALL...ANY PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO 
BE QUITE LIGHT...GENERALLY ONLY A FEW HUNDREDTHS.  ANY SNOW OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS ALSO QUITE LIGHT...WITH MOSTLY A TRACE TO POSSIBLY 
A COUPLE OF TENTHS.  DRIER...COOLER AIR WILL SETTLE IN OVERNIGHT.

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
OVERALL FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH START TO DIVERGE A BIT BY 
EARLY NEXT WEEK.  WILL START OFF THURSDAY WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE 
OVER THE REGION...THEN A COLD FRONT WILL LATER FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT.  
WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS WITH THIS FEATURE.  THERMAL 
PROFILES LOOK COLD ENOUGH FOR MENTION OF SNOW ESPECIALLY HIGHER

PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN BEHIND THE FRONT...WITH TEMPS BELOW SEASONAL 
NORMS FOR THE WEEKEND.  SHOULD BE DRY BOTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WITH 
NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHING BY TUESDAY.  GFS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THIS

OF THE APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH/UPPER LOW. SOME WEAK RADAR 
RETURNS ALSO NOTED...BUT NOT MUCH PRECIPITATION (PCPN) REACHING THE 
SURFACE JUST YET. 

EXPECT LOWERING MID DECK CLOUDS AFTER ABOUT 03Z TO 06Z WEDNESDAY
AND MOISTURE MAY BE SUFFICIENT FOR A STRAY SNOW OR RAIN SHOWER AT
TRI AROUND AND AFTER 18Z WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...I DON'T SEE ENOUGH 
MOISTURE OR LIFT TO CREATE LOWER THAN VFR CONDITIONS EVEN AT TRI.

THUS...TAFS FEATURE VFR CONDITIONS WITH LIGHT AND VARIABLE WINDS 
OVERNIGHT...THEN WESTERLY WINDS AROUND 10 MPH BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. 

PREVIOUS FORECAST DISCUSSION BELOW...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SKIES ARE MOSTLY SUNNY AT MID 
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH TEMPERATURES A 
FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S. A COLD FRONT 
WAS MOVING INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MID MS VALLEY THIS 
AFTERNOON. A WEAK SHORT WAVE WAS DEVELOPING SOME LIGHT RAIN AHEAD OF 
IT OVER ARKANSAS. TONIGHT...SKIES WILL BE CLEAR INITIALLY AND THEN 
INCREASE AFTER MIDNIGHT AS A SHORT WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE TN AND OHIO 
RIVER VALLEYS AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. PRECIPITATION SHOULD BEGIN 
LATE IN THE FIRST PERIOD ON THE PLATEAU AND THEN SPREAD INTO THE 
NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR 
FREEZING NORTHEAST...WITH A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION POSSIBLE MAINLY 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA. LOWER ELEVATIONS COULD SEE A 
MIXTURE IN THE MORNING BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN. FOR HIGHS WEDNESDAY 
STAYED A FEW DEGREES BELOW COOLEST GUIDANCE. OVER SOUTHWEST VA... 
HIGHS MAY ONLY REACH THE LOWER 40S AND HOVER IN THE 30S DURING THE 
MORNING.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A QUIET PATTERN WITH A COLD FRONT ON 
THE WEEKEND BEING THE MAIN FEATURE. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS 
THE SOUTHEAST REGION ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...BRINGING TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS AND NEAR NORMAL TEMPS. A FAIRLY STRONG COLD FRONT IS THEN 
PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT... 
WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND IT CREATING SOME LIGHT PRECIP INTO 
SATURDAY. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN SETTLE OVER THE 
REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...BRINGING BELOW NORMAL TEMPS FOR A CHANGE. 
THIS HIGH SHOULD THEN DRIFT EAST OF THE REGION ON MONDAY...WITH 
SOUTHERLY FLOW ON ITS BACK SIDE BRINGING A RETURN TO ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPS. ANOTHER WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE

NO MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...WEAK SHORT WAVE RIDES 
THROUGH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY.  MAIN BAND OF MOISTURE AND LIFT STAYS 
OVER NORTHERN LOCATIONS FOR 20 TO 30 POPS AND OUR BEST CHANCE OF 
PRECIP DURING THE EXTENDED.  COOL TEMPERATURES IN PLACE FOR LIGHT 
SNOW OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS EARLY IN THE MORNING...ALL PRECIP SHOULD 
HAVE SWITCHED TO RAIN BY LATE MORNING.  A FEW SHOWERS...POSSIBLY 
LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES...MAY LINGER OVER FAR NORTHERN AND EASTERN 
AREAS WEDNESDAY EVENING.  OVERALL...PRECIP WILL REMAIN LIGHT THROUGH 
THE EVENING AND LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION EXPECTED.  SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  ANOTHER WEAK WAVE 
SLIDES THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...EXITING SATURDAY MORNING.  AGAIN LOOKS 
TO BE A LIGHT PRECIP EVENT AND WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION LOW POPS 
NORTHERN HALF.  TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE COOL ENOUGH THAT THE PRECIP 
SWITCHES TO LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES OVERNIGHT BUT AGAIN LITTLE TO NO 
ACCUMULATION EXPECTED.  WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS SUNDAY AND MONDAY.

PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON 
TRACK. WILL UPDATE FORECAST TO REMOVE EVENING GROUP. NO OTHER

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...WEAK SURFACE TROUGH WAS
STILL LOCATED OVER EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA THIS AFTERNOON. LOW
CLOUDS WERE STARTING TO SCATTER OUT ACROSS THE EASTERN TN VALLEY
AND SW NC THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES HAD WARMED TO THE LOWER TO
MID 50S IN MOST LOCATIONS EXCEPT 40S HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHICH IS
NEAR THE SEASONAL NORMALS. A WEAK UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE
CINCINNATI AREA WILL CONTINUE EAST INTO WV THIS EVENING AND THEN
OPEN TO A TROUGH OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY MORNING. A FEW
SPRINKLES POSSIBLE TONIGHT OVER SW VA AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES BY TO
THE NORTH. ELSEWHERE SKIES CLEARING WITH DRIER AIR WORKING IN FROM
THE WEST. PATCHY FOG STILL POSSIBLE LATE AS MOISTURE STILL NEAR THE
GROUND. LOWS NEAR FREEZING TONIGHT AND A FEW DEGREES WARMER TUESDAY
WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...FOR THE EXTENDED...A 
PATTERN CHANGE OCCURS WITH A DEEP UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE HUDSON BAY 
WITH FLOW BECOMING MORE NORTHWEST. A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES WILL MOVE 
QUICKLY SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH LIMITED MOISTURE. 
FIRST WAVE MOVES THROUGH WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH COLDER AIR 
MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. BEST DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE WILL BE 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE REGION. WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE 
POPS NORTH WITH DRY CONDITIONS SOUTH. MORE SEASONABLE AIR 
ANTICIPATED WITH VERTICAL PROFILE COLD ENOUGH FOR A MIXTURE OF SNOW 
AND RAIN FOR MAINLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

EXTENDED BECOMES MORE COMPLICATED FOR THIS WEEKEND...AS A SOUTHERN 
STREAM WAVE MOVES NORTHEAST ACROSS THE GULF INTO THE SOUTHEAST 
UNITED STATES. MOISTURE FROM THIS SYSTEM REMAIN SOUTH AND EAST OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STILL CONSIDERABLE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE LINGERING OVER THE AREA.  A SHORT WAVE WILL BRUSH THE AREA 
AS IT MOVES BY TO OUR NORTH TODAY.  TREND OF THE MODELS HAS BEEN 
DRIER WITH THIS FEATURE...AND DOES NOT APPEAR THERE WILL BE MUCH 
LIFT SO WILL HAVE FORECAST PRECIP FREE FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.  
SHOULD SEE GRADUAL DRYING LATER TODAY AND INTO TONIGHT...WITH MAINLY 
CLEAR CONDITIONS BY LATER TONIGHT. MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL 
STAY CLOSE.    

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS NOT TOO FAR APART IN 
DEPICTION OF THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST ALTHOUGH BY THE WEEKEND THE 
ECMWF BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED AND A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE GFS. 
TUESDAY STILL LOOKS GOOD WITH DRY AIR ALLOWING FOR SOME SUNSHINE. 
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW PASSAGE OF A COUPLE WEAK SHORT WAVES ABOUT 
MID WEEK. AM SKEPTICAL CONCERNING THE ABILITY FOR THESE FEATURES TO 
PRODUCE MUCH IN THE WAY OF PRECIP SO KEPT PROBABILITY IN THE SLIGHT 
TO LOW CHANCE REALM TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WITH THE FIRST WAVE 
AND THEN WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH THE TRAILING SYSTEM. LIFT IS WEAK AND 
ATMOSPHERE HAS A DIFFICULT TIME MOISTENING SUFFICIENTLY IN THIS TIME 
FRAME AND BASICALLY KEPT SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE DRY. IF PRECIP DEVELOPS 
TEMPERATURES WOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A FEW LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS/FLURRIES ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. PRESSURE 
INCREASES THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY FOR A SHOT AT MORE SUNSHINE. MORE 
AMPLIFIED TROUGH BUILDS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE MIDWEST DURING THE DAY 
FRIDAY IN TIME TO PRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY 
SNOW SHOWERS LATER FRIDAY NIGHT AS COLDER AIR SPILLS IN BEHIND 
SYSTEM COLD FRONT. COLD...DRY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR THE 
DURATION OF THE WEEKEND SHUTTING DOWN THE CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION.

CLOUDS ARE SLOWLY BECOMING MORE BROKEN THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...AND 
THIS TREND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING AS DRIER AIR 
ADVECTS INTO THE AREA. AS HIGH PRESSURE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS 
BUILDS SOUTHWARD...A SOUTHEASTERLY FETCH OFF THE ATLANTIC WILL BRING

ISENTROPIC LIFT AND AN UPSLOPE WIND COMPONENT MAY BRING ISOLATED 
SHOWERS INTO CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES LATE TONIGHT. CLOUDS MAY 
SPREAD INTO THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY AS WELL BY MORNING.

LIMITED TO BELOW 700 MB...BUT SOME WEAK LIFT WITH THE VORT MAX AND

IN NORTHERN AREAS. THERE IS MUCH UNCERTAINTY REGARDING TEMPERATURES 
AS CLOUD COVER WILL BE VARIABLE...BUT LEANED TOWARD THE COOLER SIDE 
OF GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
SHORT RANGE MODELS SHOW WEAK UPPER LOW MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN PART 
OF FORECAST AREA MONDAY EVENING WITH A FEW SHOWERS POSSIBLE. THINK 
THIS FEATURE WILL BE A QUICK MOVER AND WILL REACH THE OTHER SIDE OF 
THE APPALACHIANS BY 06Z SO HAVE LEFT MONDAY NIGHT DRY ALTHOUGH A FEW

ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE AREA THIS
MORNING...WITH LOW CLOUDS AND FOG JUST BEGINNING TO SHOW SIGNS OF
LIFTING. SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS DRIER AIR ACROSS EASTERN KY...AND
MODELS SHOW LOWER SURFACE DEWPOINTS WORKING THEIR WAY INTO THE AREA

IN PLACE TODAY. REGIONAL 12Z SOUNDINGS SHOW VERY DRY AIR ABOVE 800
MB...SO NO MEASURABLE PRECIP IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE DAY. DUAL-POL
RADAR DATA SHOWS LIGHT DRIZZLE OVER NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA.

THE UPDATE WILL REMOVE POPS BUT MENTION ISOLATED SPRINKLES NORTH.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SOME DRYING WILL TAKE PLACE TODAY 
AS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM PULLS AWAY.  ANY LINGERING PATCHES OF LIGHT 
RAIN WILL END OVER MUCH OF THE AREA BY MID AFTERNOON...BUT WILL KEEP 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE EAST TN 
MOUNTAINS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON.  MODELS DO NOT AGREE VERY WELL ON 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THAT APPROACHES THE AREA TONIGHT.  NAM ON THE 
WEAK SIDE WITH THIS...AND TREND OF THE MODELS HAS BEEN WEAKER AND 
DRIER.  WILL KEEP QUITE A FEW CLOUDS AROUND AND KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS GOING IN SOME OF THE MOUNTAIN ZONES...BUT OTHERWISE WILL HAVE A 
DRY FORECAST TONIGHT.  MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS OVER 
HIGHER TERRAIN LATE TONIGHT IF ANY PRECIP DOES OCCUR.  WILL UNDERCUT 
SOME MAV TEMPS A BIT TODAY...BUT OVERALL WILL NOT STRAY FAR.   

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...NO MAJOR AMPLIFICATION OF THE 
UPPER PATTERN IS EXPECTED DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH SEVERAL 
WEAKER SHORT WAVE FEATURES GRADUALLY DEEPENING INTO AN EASTERN U.S. 
UPPER TROUGH BY FRIDAY. MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT IN THIS 
PATTERN BUT GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE ECMWF WHICH STARTS THE PERIOD 
MONDAY WITH A WEAK SOUTHERN OHIO VALLEY THROUGH SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS TRANSITING TRAILING SHORT WAVE TROUGH. THIS FEATURE 
LACKS SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND LIFT FOR MORE THAN A SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
FOR A SPRINKLE DURING THE MORNING MAINLY ACROSS A SMALL PART OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. NICE DRY PERIOD MONDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT STILL LOOKS GOOD. EUROPEAN MODEL SHOWS A 
COUPLE WEAK SHORT WAVES WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY NIGHT SO KEPT A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP FOR A SHOWER DURING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST. WE MAY BE 
ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT A DRY THURSDAY WHILE AWAITING AMPLIFICATION OF 
EASTERN CANADIAN UPPER TROUGH DROPPING THROUGH THE NORTHEASTERN 
QUARTER OF THE NATION. WOULD EXPECT A COLD FRONT TO ACCOMPANY THIS 
SYSTEM AND APPLIED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS DURING THE DAY AT THIS 
REMOTE PERIOD OF THE EXTENDED WHILE MIXING IN A BIT OF SNOW FRIDAY 
NIGHT AS COLDER AIR SPILLS IN BEHIND THE FRONT. DRY COLD ADVECTION 
BUILDS INTO THE REGION FOR SATURDAY ALLOWING A RETURN TO SOME 
SUNSHINE. TEMP FORECAST DIFFICULT WITH FORECAST AREA IN BETWEEN THE 
CHILLY NORTHEASTERN U.S. AIRMASS AND MILDER DEEP SOUTHERN AIR. 
STAYED A COUPLE DEGREES BELOW MAXES MOST OF THE FORECAST ESPECIALLY 
ON WEDNESDAY WITH EXPECTED WEATHER. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO MINS.

LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS THIS MORNING HAVE BEEN GENERATED BY ISENTROPIC
LIFT. WE WILL SEE A BRIEF LULL IN PRECIP AS THIS LIFT EXITS NORTH. A
LINE OF CONVECTIVE SHOWERS OVER MIDDLE TN APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED
WITH A LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ZONE AND THETA-E RIDGE AXIS. THE RUC
HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON THE LOCATION OF THIS PRECIP...AND SHOWS IT
NEAR OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES BY 18Z. GIVEN THE SW-NE ORIENTATION OF
THE LINE...MOST PRECIP WILL BE IN NORTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. WILL MAKE SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO POP/WX GRIDS
TO BETTER MATCH THESE TRENDS. SLIGHT DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS WILL ALSO
BE MADE TO TEMPERATURES TO MATCH LATEST GUIDANCE.

FRONT PRODUCING SOME LIGHT PRECIP...AND THIS PRECIP WILL CONTINUE TO 
LIFT NORTH ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. MAY BE A LULL IN THE PRECIP OVER 
AT LEAST SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA AS THIS BAND LIFTS NORTH...THEN 
PRECIP WILL PICK UP AGAIN AS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS IN AND DRAGS 
A COLD FRONT THROUGH.  INSTABILITY LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE 
LIMITED...BUT ENOUGH TO WARRANT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER IN THE 
FORECAST AT LEAST SOUTHWEST TWO THIRDS OF THE AREA LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT.  WILL HAVE CAT POPS ALL ZONES TONIGHT. MAV 
TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL ONLY MAKE A FEW TWEAKS.   

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS A LITTLE CLOSER IN 
DEPICTION OF EXPECTED WEATHER THROUGH ABOUT MID WEEK. STAYED WITH 
THE LINGERING SHOWERS CONCEPT ON SUNDAY AS TRAILING UPPER LOW BUILDS 
EAST FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY 
12Z MONDAY. PREFERRING THE FASTER GFS SCENARIO OVER THE ECMWF 
ENABLES PRECIP TO WRAP UP LATER SUNDAY NIGHT WITH A NICE TWO DAY DRY 
PERIOD MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. THE NEXT FEATURE TO IMPACT THE REGION 
MAY BE A QUICK MOVING SHORT WAVE WHICH COULD BRING A PERIOD OF LIGHT 
SHOWERS TO THE FORECAST AREA MAINLY DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY. KEPT 
THURSDAY DRY BUT ADDED A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS HIGHER TERRAIN THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS A BROAD UPPER

SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...RIDGING SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL 
DOMINATE THE FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY. DRIER DEWPOINTS WILL CONTINUE 
TO ADVECT INTO THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT WHICH WILL LIMIT FOG 
CHANCES EVEN THOUGH CLEAR SKY AND CALM WINDS ARE ANTICIPATED. FOR 
FRIDAY...SURFACE RIDGE WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA...BUT UPPER RIDGE 
WILL CONTINUE WITH UNSEASONABLY MILD TEMPERATURES ANTICIPATED.

MODELS DO SHOW A GOOD DEAL OF HIGH/MID LEVEL CLOUDS SPILLING OVER 
THE RIDGE INTO THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY...BUT OVERALL MOSTLY 
SUNNY/PARTLY SUNNY FORECAST.

LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BEGIN TO SHIFT EAST FRIDAY NIGHT AS LOW PRESSURE IN THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS HEADS FOR THE MS AND LOWER OHIO VALLEYS. A WARM FRONT MOVING 
NORTHEAST FROM AL WILL REACH THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY. RAIN 
WILL SPREAD FROM SW TO NE LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. INCREASED 
INSTABILITY SATURDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE LOW PRESSURE AREA BRINGS A 
CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS. LATE SATURDAY NIGHT OR EARLY SUNDAY THE 
LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL BE OVER EAST TN. SHORT RANGE MODELS TRY TO 
DEVELOP A WAVE ALONG FRONT TO THE SOUTH SUNDAY INTO MONDAY SO WILL 
KEEP SHOWERS IN THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY BUT THE BULK OF 
THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD FALL SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. MONDAY

RELATIVELY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS HAVE COME INTO
BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE
EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH THE MAIN FEATURE BEING THE SLOW EASTWARD
PROGRESSION OF A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY
ON SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO INCREASE RAPIDLY

FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH. THIS WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO
THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...WITH SHOWERS BECOMING LIKELY AS
CONVECTION MOVES EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ALONG THIS
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE LOCAL AIR MASS WILL BE
FAIRLY STABLE...SO WILL NOT MENTION ANY THUNDER FOR NOW...BUT LATER
FORECASTS MAY NEED TO ADD THUNDER FOR SATURDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT
DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME ELEVATED CONVECTION. LATEST ECMWF
MODEL RUN APPEARS TO BE COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE GFS
MODEL FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...AND INDICATE THAT THE COLD FRONT
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL PASS THROUGH THE
FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY MORNING...WITH SOME POST-FRONTAL SHOWERS
LINGERING INTO MONDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE

A MID-UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA THIS
EVENING. MOST OF THE RAIN IS EXPECTED TO BE EAST OF THE AREA BY
AROUND MIDNIGHT AS LIFT MOVES OUT AND MIDLEVEL DRY AIR BUILDS IN.
HOWEVER THE SURFACE COLD FRONT IS LAGGING WELL BEHIND THE
TROUGH...AND IS CURRENTLY POSITIONED FROM THE OZARKS TO JUST NORTH
OF THE OHIO VALLEY. FROPA IS NOT EXPECTED UNTIL AFTER 12Z...SO LOW
CLOUDS AND FOG ARE EXPECTED TO LINGER OVERNIGHT. TEMPS AND
DEWPOINTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO FALL VERY MUCH FROM CURRENT OBSERVED
VALUES OVERNIGHT. WILL ALSO KEEP A CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP
GOING LATE TONIGHT AND TOMORROW MORNING UNTIL THE FRONTAL PASSAGE.
BY AFTERNOON...WE SHOULD SEE CLEAR SKIES. COLD ADVECTION IS VERY
WEAK BEHIND THE FRONT AS THE UPPER JET STAYS WELL NORTH...SO TEMPS
WILL CONTINUE TO BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL...REACHING THE 60S ACROSS
MOST OF THE TN VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY LATE WEDNESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL ENHANCE THE LIFT OVER A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION
OF STRONG JET MOVING THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY WILL ENHANCE THE LIFT
OVER THE AREA. ALSO...ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL FINALLY MOISTEN UP THE
AIRMASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS
WEDNESDAY AND FIRST HALF OF WEDNESDAY NIGHT. VERY LIMITED
INSTABILITY...SO NO THUNDER MENTIONED.

SYSTEM WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA EARLY THURSDAY WITH CLEARING SKY.
REALLY NO COLD AIR BEHIND SYSTEM...SO UNSEASONABLY MILD CONDITIONS
WILL REMAIN.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS 
OVER THE AREA THROUGH FRIDAY. MOISTURE INCREASES RAPIDLY FRIDAY 
NIGHT AS SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW STRENGTHENS. WET WEEKEND AHEAD. CUT OFF 
LOW WILL MEANDER NE FROM THE FOUR CORNERS AREA. STRENGTH AND 
POSITION OF LOW UNCERTAIN THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. UPPER 
DIVERGENCE...ISENTROPIC LIFT AND AVAILABLE MOISTURE WILL RESULT IN A 
SERIES OF PRECIPITATION ACROSS THE SOUTH...TENNESSEE VALLEY AND THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH SUNDAY.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL LIKELY 
BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST BY LATE SUNDAY. CONDITIONS SHOULD 
BE DRIER INTO NEXT WEEK. AGAIN...POSITION OF UPPER LOW/TROUGHING 
OVER THE OHIO VALLEY REMAINS IN QUESTION. WILL BASE FORECAST ON A 
DRIER SOLUTION BANKING ON MOST WRAP AROUND ACTIVITY TO STAY NORTH OF 
THE AREA. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES CONTINUE.

LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST... 
WHICH WAS CREATING A BROAD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING...WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY 
INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE 
PLAINS IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE INTO THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY 
LATE TONIGHT...BRING A FURTHER INCREASE IN CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A FEW SHOWERS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TOWARDS SUNRISE...SO WILL 
INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THESE AREAS. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND 
GFS NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY...BUT REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES FOR TONIGHT. WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER NAM 
NUMBER TONIGHT...DUE TO THE CLOUD COVER AND SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW 
OVER THE REGION.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE 
REGION ON THE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WILL CONTINUE THE 
HIGHEST CHANCES ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN THE DEEPEST MOISTURE AND 
BEST LIFT IS EXPECTED TO ARRIVE. UPPER TROUGH FOLLOWS ON THURSDAY... 
SO WILL CONTINUE CHANCES FOR THURSDAY. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS 
PROVIDING A BRIEF PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER FOR FRIDAY. ANOTHER FRONT 
SHOULD ENTER THE REGION SATURDAY AND LINGER INTO SUNDAY...UPPER LOW 
FOLLOWS BRINGING A CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY. COULD SEE 
LIGHT SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATION ON SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT SHOULD 
BE TOO WARM AND TOO BRIEF FOR ANY ACCUMULATION. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC

BEGUN...HOWEVER SURFACE DEW POINTS VERY DRY UPSTREAM BACK TO LOWER 
MISS VALLEY.  850-700 MB MOISTURE SHOULD RETURN FASTER AND SHOULD BE 
SOME INCREASE IN CLOUDS TUESDAY AND CERTAINLY TUESDAY NIGHT.

PLAN TO HOLD OFF ON POPS OF 15 PERCENT OR GREATER THROUGH THIS 
PERIOD...EVEN THOUGH MOS GUIDANCE POPS TUESDAY NIGHT GENERALLY 15-25 
PERCENT.  MODELS SHOW MOISTURE RELATIVELY SHALLOW LAYER AND IN WARM 
ENOUGH TEMPS TO KEEP DENDRITIC GROW TO A MINIMUM...ALSO...NOT
EXPECTING ANY ELEVATED INSTABILITY BY TUESDAY NIGHT EITHER...SO
KEEPING IT DRY FOR NOW.

PLAN TO STICK CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPS...WITH WARMER OVERNIGHT LOW 
TEMPS WARMER TUESDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY WEST UNDER CLOUD COVER AND 
INCREASING WINDS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE RIDGING FROM THE 
ATLANTIC LOSING HOLD OVER THE AREA. LAYER FLOW INCREASINGLY 
SOUTHWEST WITH JUMP IN LAYER RH. ISENTROPIC LIFT GETS GOING 
WEDNESDAY WITH BEST RAIN CHANCE IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVE THROUGH EARLY 
THURSDAY. LAYER RIDGING AND DRIER AIRMASS TAKE OVER THROUGH FRIDAY. 

A WET PERIOD SETS UP FOR THE WEEKEND. EVOLUTION OF FOUR CORNERS CUT 
OFF LOW REMAINS IN QUESTION. HOWEVER PATTERN SUPPORTS ANOTHER 
INJECTION OF DEEP MOISTURE THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY IN ADVANCE
OF THE SYSTEM. COLD FRONT AND SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL LIKELY MOVE 
SLOWLY EAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATE ON SUNDAY/EARLY MONDAY. 
USING A BLEND OF MODEL SOLUTIONS AND WEEKEND POPS ARE LIKELY 
UNDERDONE. WARM TEMPERATURES CONTINUE WITH NEXT PROMISE OF SUB ZERO

HIGHS WILL BE BELOW RECORD MAXES. LOW RH IN THE AFTERNOONS EACH DAY
BUT WIND SPEEDS STAY WELL BELOW RED FLAG CRITERIA FOR FIRE WEATHER
DISTRICTS...SO I JUST HIGHLIGHTED IN THE FWF PRODUCT FOR NOW.

OTHERWISE...WEAK COLD FRONT WAS MOVING INTO NW KY AT FORECAST TIME

OR ALTOCUMULUS CLOUDS DEVELOP OVER PARTS OF KY INTO THE SRN OHIO
VALLEY...SO KEPT A FEW CLOUDS IN OUR NRN AREAS TONIGHT. GENERALLY
CLEAR ELSEWHERE WITH MIN TEMPS JUST ABOUT NORMAL. NOT QUITE AS COOL
MONDAY NIGHT WITH SW LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPING. MOS TEMPS WERE
QUITE CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED FOR ALL 4 PERIODS.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS VERY DISSIMILAR 
AGAIN FROM ABOUT THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY SO DID NOT MAKE MAJOR 
CHANGES TO THE FORECAST. MAINTAINED HIGHEST CHANCE POPS FROM 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD THURSDAY AS UPPER TROUGH 
BUILDS EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES PULLING A FRONTAL BOUNDARY TOWARD 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. TRAILING ENERGY FOLLOWS INITIAL SHORT 
WAVE THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT HELPING TO 
DRAG FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. BEYOND 
THURSDAY MODELS FAR APART CONCERNING SHORT WAVE PLACEMENT/TIMING SO 
HELD ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS ON FRIDAY WITH SOME SNOW 
MIXING IN LATER FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN AS COLD AIR ADVECTION STRENGTHENS BEHIND FROPA. MODELS HINT 
AT ANOTHER CLIPPER DROPPING INTO THE REGION SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY 
NIGHT SO HELD ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR PRECIP RIGHT THROUGH 12Z 
SUNDAY WITH SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE ENTIRE CWFA BY 
DAYBREAK. FOR NEW DAY 7 (SUNDAY) JUST KEPT THE FORECAST DRY AWAITING

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH A COLD FRONT 
OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT THE 
MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE WITH THIS FRONT WILL BE VERY LIMITED. 
THUS...EXPECT THIS COLD FRONT TO BRING JUST A SLIGHT INCREASE IN 
HIGH CLOUDS...AND BREEZY SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS IN THE AFTERNOON. HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH TONIGHT...BRINGING 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...NAM AND GFS NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE AND WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL START THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH 
DRY CONDITIONS.  AN UPPER TROUGH DRIVING SOUTH OUT OF CANADA INTO 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES WILL BE THE NEXT WEATHER MAKER. AS 
SURFACE RIDGING IN THE GULF MOVES EAST...RETURN FLOW OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL PULL MOISTURE NORTH INTO INCOMING SHORT-WAVE 
TROUGH. SHOWERS WILL BREAK OUT ACROSS THE PLAINS TOWARD THE OHIO 
VALLEY/GREAT LAKES TUESDAY. ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVES INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR WEDNESDAY WITH A RETURN CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS.

FOR THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...A GREAT DEAL OF MODELS DIFFERENCE IS 
NOTED WITH TIMING OF ADDITIONAL SHORT-WAVE DIVING ACROSS THE PLAINS 
STATES TOWARD THE OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEYS. TIMING OF THESE WAVES IS 
ALL OVER THE PLACE MAKING FORECAST OF BEST CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION 
DIFFICULT WITH LOW CONFIDENCE. HOWEVER...ALL MODELS SHOW A PATTER 
CHANGE BY NEXT WEEK WITH A LARGE SCALE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION WITH MUCH COLDER AIR SPILLING INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. HAVE UNDER-CUT GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES FOR LATE IN THE 
PERIOD...BUT COULD BE EVEN COLDER IF MODELS VERIFY.

ALSO...TIMING OF INDIVIDUAL WAVES DIVING INTO LONG-WAVE TROUGH COULD 
SET THE STAGE FOR SNOW...ESPECIALLY FOR THE MOUNTAINS...NEXT WEEKEND.

327 PM EST SAT JAN 28 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...RAPID CLEARING BEHIND THE
EXITING COLD FRONT WITH MUCH LOWER DEW POINT TEMPS UPSTREAM.
CLEARING SKIES AND DECREASING WINDS OVERNIGHT FAVOR THE COOLER MOS
MINS. WON'T FORECAST ANY PATCHY FOG SINCE THE BRISK WESTERLY WINDS
KICKED IN THIS AFTERNOON TO DRY THINGS OUT.

ANOTHER FAST MOVING CLIPPER TYPE SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT
LAKES AND SRN OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY...BUT THIS ONE IS MUCH TOO FAR
NORTH TO REALLY AFFECT US VERY MUCH. HOWEVER...I DID KEEP NRN AREAS
CLOSER TO THE COOLER MOS MAX TEMPS ON SUNDAY. MIDNIGHT SHIFT COULD
AT LEAST CONSIDER A POSSIBLE WIND ADVISORY FOR OUR HIGHEST TERRAIN
AREAS...BUT I THINK MOST GUSTS WILL STAY BELOW 40 MPH. 

MINIMUM RH VALUES FALL WELL BELOW 20 PERCENT SUNDAY AFTERNOON WITH
SOME SUSTAINED WIND SPEEDS 20 MPH OR GREATER. HOWEVER...FUEL
MOISTURES SHOULD STILL BE ON THE WET SIDE IN NEARLY ALL AREAS. PER
COORDINATION WITH GSP...I CONTACTED OUR SW NC FIRE WEATHER FOLKS...
AND I WILL ALSO ISSUE A FIRE DANGER STATEMENT FOR THOSE DISTRICTS
IN LINE WITH GSP AND RAH PLANS. 

FOR THE LATER PERIODS...UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL...WHILE THE
SURFACE RIDGE SETTLES OVER THE SE STATES SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.
SOUTHWEST FLOW ON BACK SIDE OF THE SURFACE RIDGE BRINGS EVEN WARMER
TEMPS...SO SORRY FOR ANYONE THAT HAS BEEN SEEKING SNOW THIS WINTER. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS STILL HAVING 
DIFFICULTY IN THE LONGER TERM PERIOD WITH LITTLE AGREEMENT 
ESPECIALLY FROM THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. WAS ABLE TO KEEP MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TUESDAY DRY. NEXT WEAK SHORT WAVE PUSHES EAST ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES INTO SOUTHEASTERN CANADA DRIVING A FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
SLOWLY SOUTH INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY 12Z WEDNESDAY AND THEN THE 
BOUNDARY SLIPS CLOSER TO THE AREA LATER IN THE DAY. SOME QUESTION AS 
TO HOW MUCH RAIN MAY OCCUR ON WEDNESDAY AND SO STAYED WITH MAINLY 30 
PERCENT POPS DURING THE DAY WHILE INCREASING TO 40 PERCENT WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. A TRAILING SHORT WAVELENGTH TROUGH PRESSES INTO 
THE APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THIS PERIOD WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE 
LOW PRESSURE FINALLY DRAGGING COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
THURSDAY NIGHT. MODELS IN DISAGREEMENT BUT MAINTAINED A DRY FRIDAY 
AND APPLIED SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS SATURDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WITH ECMWF DEPICTING UPPER TROUGH DESCENDING 
SOUTH THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. LATER MODEL 
RUNS WILL CERTAINLY BRING THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST INTO BETTER 
FOCUS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY... 
WITH A DRY AND SEASONABLY COOL AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS 
WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY TODAY...BRINGING AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND BREEZY WINDS. 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED WITH THIS 
FRONT...SO WILL MENTION ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS OVER THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD 
ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH TONIGHT...BRINGING MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND 
LIGHT WINDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS 
NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL 
COMPROMISE WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS 
THE GREAT LAKES WILL START THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT DYNAMICS AND 
MOISTURE FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL BE MAINLY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
A DRY START IS EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY. UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST OF THE 
NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH UPPER FLOW OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
BECOMING MORE WEST TO SOUTHWEST ALLOWING FOR A WARM-UP INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. SURFACE RIDING INTO THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL KEEP 
THE AIR-MASS DRY THROUGH TUESDAY. 

BY LATE TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE NATION WITH MOISTURE STREAMING NORTH AROUND 
THE BACK SIDE OF RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE SOUTHEAST 
UNITED STATES. MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE OVER THE TENNESSEE 
AND OHIO VALLEYS MID-WEEK. GULF MOISTURE WILL POOL ALONG A COLD 
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH FROM UPPER TROUGH. THIS FRONT ALONG WITH 
RETURN OF MOISTURE WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND THURSDAY. GFS AND ECMWF HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENT IN REGARD TO THE 
STRENGTH OF A SHORT-WAVE ROTATING SOUTHEAST FROM THE UPPER TROUGH 
TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. THE ECMWF IS STRONGER AND GFS IS WEAKER. 
CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON STRENGTH OF SYSTEM...BUT WILL CALL FOR BOUNDARY 
AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE TO PULL SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY 
NIGHT WITH DRIER AIR BY FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAIN FEATURE TO AFFECT OUR
FORECAST FOR TONIGHT IS THE AMOUNT OF LINGERING CLOUDS. THE LATEST
VISIBLE SATELLITE PICS SHOW CLOUDS HOLDING NORTH OF I-40 INCLUDING
BULK OF NE TN AND SW VA. THESE LINGERING CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO
DECREASE THIS EVENING...AND PERHAPS AT LEAST BRIEFLY CLEAR OUT...
BEFORE CLOUDS INCREASE LATE TONIGHT WITH THE UPSTREAM SHORTWAVE
AND WEAK COLD FRONT. I KEPT MIN TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE GFS MOS
DUE TO LIGHT WINDS AND THE POTENTIAL CLOUDS.

WEAK FRONT ON SATURDAY SHOULD PRODUCE JUST TRACE AMOUNTS OF PCPN...
SO I KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS WHERE LOW POPS OR
SPRINKLE/FLURRY WORDING WAS USED. DECREASED SKY COVER OVER SE TN
AND SW NC TO BETTER MESH WITH OUR SRN NWS NEIGHBORS. REINFORCEMENT
OF COOL AIR FAVORS COOLER MOS HIGHS OVER SW VA/NE TN AND MILDER
HIGHS SE TN/SW NC.

OTHERWISE...MOSTLY CLEAR AND DRY SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY WITH
SOME CHILLY MINS SAT NIGHT...THEN A BIT ABOVE CLIMO ON SUNDAY MAXES.
VERY LITTLE IF ANY CHANGES MADE FOR THOSE 2 PERIODS.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE PERIOD BEGINS WITH
AN EXITING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. HEIGHTS BUILD ALL THE WAY THROUGH
TUESDAY HOWEVER...NEXT LOW AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVE MAKES ITS WAY
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON WEDNESDAY WHILE DRAGGING A COLD FRONT
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE FINAL TWO DAYS OF THE
EXTENDED FORECAST GET A BIT MURKY WITH LITTLE AGREEMENT IN EXTENDED
MODELS. WENT WITH THE HPC IDEA OF STALLING THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
JUST EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS AWAITING A TRAILING SHORT WAVELENGTH
FEATURE WHICH WILL KEEP SOME SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST ON THURSDAY.
IN THIS SCENARIO FRIDAY ENDS UP WITH DRY COLD ADVECTION. WENT A
LITTLE ABOVE THE COLDER MEX MOS GUIDANCE THROUGH FIRST HALF OF THE
PERIOD AND STAYED CLOSE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST.

PRESSURE BUILDING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY BEHIND IT. MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT SOME LINGERING SHOWERS THIS MORNING WILL 
GRADUALLY DIMINISH BY THE AFTERNOON. CLOUDS SHOULD ALSO GRADUALLY 
DECREASE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SOME ADDITIONAL HIGH CLOUDS AHEAD OF 
ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL LIKELY RETURN BY TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS... 
NAM AND GFS NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT WILL START THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH A SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS 
THE GREAT LAKES ON SATURDAY. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY MORNING WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW 
SHOWERS OR SPRINKLES VALLEY. THE FRONT MOVES EAST QUICKLY. ANOTHER 
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH MOVES QUICKLY BACK INTO THE GREAT LAKES FOR 
SUNDAY...BUT WILL HAVE LITTLE EFFECT ON THE FORECAST AREA.

THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES/NORTHEAST MOVES EAST ALLOWING 
THE FLOW TO BECOME MORE WEST THAN SOUTHWEST INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
GFS AND ECMWF DIVERGE ON MOVEMENT OF NEXT SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS 
THE ROCKIES THEN INTO THE PLAINS. THE GFS HAS MORE OF A SOUTHERN 
ROUTE WHILE THE ECMWF IS FARTHER SOUTH. WILL TREND TOWARD THE GFS 
FOR NOW...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW. WILL CALL FOR INCREASING CLOUDS AND 
CHANCES OF SHOWERS FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED.

THUNDERSTORMS SO FAR HAVE BEEN CONFINED TO THE SRN HALF OF AL INTO

IS SLIGHT INSTABILITY AND SUFFICIENT LIFT TO CONTINUE OUR ISOLATED

VALLEYS WITH A COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS

FRIDAY. WARM AIR AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES MILD
TODAY AND MODEL TRENDS ARE DELAYING THE START OF THE MORE STEADY
RAINFALL UNTIL THIS AFTERNOON. AREA RIVERS ARE STILL FALLING SLOWLY
BUT LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IS POSSIBLE AHEAD OF THE FRONTAL SYSTEM
TONIGHT. HOWEVER...AVERAGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF ABOUT ONE INCH WITH
LOCAL AMOUNTS UP TO TWO INCHES ARE EXPECTED TO ONLY BRING RIVERS UP
TO NEAR BANK FULL. THIS IS SIMILAR TO LEVELS FROM THE LAST SYSTEM.
LOCALIZED FLOODING IN URBAN AREAS COULD DEVELOP THIS EVENING BUT
THE HEAVIER RAINFALL IS NOT EXPECTED TO BE LONG ENOUGH TO CAUSE
SIGNIFICANT FLOODING. SLIGHT INSTABILITY WILL ALLOW ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. STRONG
SOUTHWEST WINDS ARE EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN THE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER SOUTH 
TEXAS. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF HIGH CLOUDS 
OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY MOVING NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD OF THIS 
DEVELOPING LOW. THESE HIGH CLOUDS WILL BEGIN MOVING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...BUT THE INITIAL CLOUDS SHOULD BE THIN AND 
SOMEWHAT TRANSPARENT. THUS...WILL MENTION MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES MOST 
EVERYWHERE...EXCEPT OVER SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC WHERE PARTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES SHOULD BE THE RULE. WITH OVERNIGHT MINS EXPECTED TO 
FALL CLOSE TO THE DEWPOINTS BY SUNRISE...WILL PLAN TO MENTION SOME 
PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO MENTION PATCHY FOG AND TO TWEAK SKY 
CONDITIONS AND MINS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

255 PM EST TUE JAN 24 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A STORM SYSTEM WILL BREW
OVER THE BIG BEND OF TEXAS TONIGHT...TAPPING GULF AND SUBTROPICAL
MOISTURE AS IT MOVES EAST. THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THAT SYSTEM...WHICH
WILL BE A CLOSED LOW...WILL DRAG OUT THE RAIN EVENT ACROSS OUR
AREA...WITH THE HEAVIEST HOLDING OFF UNTIL THE LONG TERM /DISCUSSED
BELOW/. UNTIL THEN...A FAIR NIGHT TONIGHT WILL SURRENDER TO INCREASING
CLOUDINESS WEDNESDAY MORNING...AND LIGHT RAIN WILL BEGIN TO
INFILTRATE THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE WEST AROUND THE NOON HOUR.
NOT EXPECTING MUCH ALONG THE TN/NC BORDER THROUGH SUNDOWN
WEDNESDAY...MAYBE A SPRINKLE OR TWO IF THAT. TEMPERATURES WILL
CONTINUE THEIR MILD REGIME AND WINDS WILL BE FAIRLY LIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS SHOW AN 
UPPER TROUGH MOVING EAST OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE GULF 
COASTS STATES WITH A NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT FROM NORTHERN STREAM 
WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY. NORTHERN STREAM JET 
COMBINED WITH THE SOUTHERN STREAM JET WILL PLACE THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY UNDER FAVORED UPPER DIVERGENCE. FAIRLY DECENT FRONTO-GENETIC 
FORCING ALONG WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTHERN SHORT-WAVE 
WILL PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS/RAIN OVER THE AREA THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT.

THERE ARE SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT MODEL DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE GFS 
AND NAM/ECMWF SOLUTION. THE GFS SHOWS MUCH LESS PHASING BETWEEN THE 
NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN JET SHORT-WAVES/JETS. THIS ALLOWS THE GULF 
SHORT-WAVE TO MOVE SLOWER AND PRODUCE MUCH MORE RAINFALL ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. I HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE IN GFS SOLUTION SINCE 
THE PREVIOUS MODELS RUNS TRENDED TOWARD THE CURRENT NAM/ECMWF 
SOLUTION.  WILL TREND FORECAST TOWARD THE ECMWF WHICH SHOWS A MORE 
PROGRESSIVE MOVEMENT. WILL END RAIN CHANCES FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

FOR THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...MODELS SHOW UPPER FLOW 
BECOMING MORE WEST WITH A SERIES OF WEAK NORTHERN STREAM WAVES FOR 
THE WEEKEND. WILL KEEP WEATHER DRY UNTIL TUESDAY AS ANOTHER SOUTHERN 
STREAM WAVE MAY MOVE INTO REGION BY LATE IN THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...WITH THE MAIN WEATHER NOW 
OFF TO OUR EAST...WE ARE ONLY AWAITING THE COLD FRONT TO PASS
THROUGH. IT SHOULD BE AN UNEVENTFUL FROPA AND WILL MOSTLY SCOUR OUT
THE ELEVATED DEWPOINTS AND ALLOW MIN TEMPS IN THE 30S ACROSS THE
VALLEY TONIGHT...BUT HIGHS WILL REBOUND TO ABOVE AVERAGE AGAIN
TUESDAY WITH MID TO UPPER 50S IN THE VALLEY. WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE FRONT THIS EVENING ARE GONNA BECOME INCREASINGLY SOUTHWESTERLY
OR WESTERLY BUT THIS WILL NOT BE AN OVERLY BREEZY SITUATION FOR US.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE AND UPPER 
RIDGING WILL START THE EXTENDED WITH DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT...BUT RIDGING BREAKS DOWN QUICKLY WITH NEXT UPPER TROUGH 
MOVING OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE GULF COAST STATES FOR 
LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. AT THE SAME TIME...A NORTHERN 
STREAM UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WITH ASSOCIATED 
COLD COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. NORTHERN STREAM 
JET ALONG WITH JET FROM SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH WILL PLACE THE AREA 
UNDER DIVERGENCE ALOFT. THE AGEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION FROM THE JETS 
WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTOGENETIC FORCING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. WIDESPREAD SHOWERS/RAIN ANTICIPATED. 
INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED TO THE GULF COAST STATES...SO DO NOT 
PLAN ON MENTIONING THUNDER WITH THIS SYSTEM.

FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE EXTENDED (THIS WEEKEND)...UPPER FLOW

TN...WITH A COLD AIR DAMMING SCENARIO OVER THE CAROLINAS. MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY LATE TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED 
SQUALL LINE LIKELY RACING AHEAD OF IT AND INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
LATE TONIGHT TOWARDS SUNRISE. THIS SQUALL LINE SHOULD WEAKEN 
SOMEWHAT AFTER MIDNIGHT...AS IT MOVES INTO A MORE STABLE AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...WITH A STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 
60 TO 70 KT) PROGGED TO BE MOVING OVER THE FORECAST AREA AROUND 
SUNRISE...THINK THAT SOME DAMAGING WINDS AND AN ISOLATED TORNADO 
WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THIS SQUALL LINE EARLY MONDAY MORNING.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE LATER THIS EVENING TO TWEAK PRECIP WORDING. WITH DEWPOINTS 
ALREADY IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA... 
WILL PLAN TO RAISE MINS A LITTLE SINCE THESE DEWPOINTS SHOULD RISE A 
LITTLE MORE BEFORE FRONTAL PASSAGE AFTER SUNRISE ON MONDAY MORNING. 
WIND ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK AS WELL... 
WITH THE CAMP CREEK TOWER IN SOUTHEAST GREENE COUNTY ALREADY 
REPORTING WIND GUSTS UP TO 50 MPH.

.AVIATION...STRONG STORM SYSTEM CURRENTLY DRIVING EAST INTO THE
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH CONVECTION INTIATING ON SYSTEM SQUALL LINE JUST
EAST OF THE OZARKS. THE MAIN PRECIP TYPE FOR THE TERMINALS THROUGH
MOST OF THE FIRST 12 HOURS OF THE FORECAST WOULD BE SCATTERED
SHOWERS OCCURING WELL AHEAD OF THE CONVECTIVE LINE. TRIED TO
DOWNPLAY VSBY REDUCTION IN SHOWERS ESPECIALLY AT TRI AS DOWNSLOPING
FLOW WILL KEEP PRECIP TO A MINIMUM. PRE-FRONTAL LINE OF SHOWERS
WITH POSSBILITY OF SOME THUNDER SHOULD BE IN THE VICINITY OF CHA
AROUND 10Z...TYS 11Z AND TRI AROUND 13Z SO IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME
FOR THE MAIN ACTION TO REACH FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE. QUITE A BIT OF
STRATUS AND LIGHT PRECIP TRAILS THE INITIAL LINE AS SURFACE COLD
FRONT TAKES ITS TIME MOVING TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS. MAY SEE A
RETURN TO VFR FLIGHT BY 16-18Z AT CHA AND TYS. STRONG WIND FIELD IN
THE LOW LEVELS WITH LIGHTER SURFACE FLOW REQUIRES THE USE OF LOW
LEVEL WIND SHEAR WITH A 50-60 KT LOW LEVEL JET LATER TONIGHT INTO

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...NEXT COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY.  LOW LEVEL JET WILL STRENGTHEN 
OVERNIGHT...AND WHILE DOES NOT LOOK IDEAL FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES DOES 
APPEAR SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL REACH WIND SPEEDS IN THE 
ADVISORY RANGE...SO WILL ISSUE WIND ADVISORY FOR TN MOUNTAINS FROM 
MONROE NORTH THAT WILL RUN INTO MONDAY.  MAIN PRECIP BAND SHOULD BE 
MOVING IN LATE TONIGHT AND SHOULD BE EXITING BY AROUND NOON MONDAY.  
INSTABILITY LOOKS TO BE RATHER LIMITED...BUT STILL ENOUGH FOR A 
CHANCE OF THUNDER AND GIVEN VERY STRONG LOW LEVEL SHEAR ONCE AGAIN 
THERE IS A THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS LATE TONIGHT/EARLY MONDAY 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS WESTERN AND SOUTHERN ZONES.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE LONG TERM PERIOD WILL 
START OFF FAIRLY QUIET AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF THE MONDAY SYSTEM. 
NICE DAY ON TUESDAY EXPECTED...THEN IMPACTS OF THE NEXT WEATHER 
SYSTEM BEGIN TO BE FELT BY WEDNESDAY. MODELS ARE NOW A LITTLE BETTER 
IN AGREEMENT WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM...A CLOSED LOW FROM THE SW U.S... 
SO WE ANTICIPATE SEEING CHANCES OF PRECIP WED THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. 
THE ULTIMATE PATH OF THE LUMBERING LOW WILL BE KEY TO TIMING AND 
POSITIONING OF PRECIP...BUT THURSDAY/THURS NGT/FRIDAY SHOULD BE THE 
TIME FRAME THAT THE BEST RAINFALL WILL OCCUR. IT STILL LOOKS LIKE 
THE SYSTEM WILL DEPART IN TIME FOR A NICE SATURDAY/SUNDAY...SO WILL 
CONTINUE WITH THE OPTIMISM.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN ELONGATED AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
EXTENDING ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIR SLOWLY FILTERING INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE 
EASTWARD TONIGHT...WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMING ZONAL. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS REVEAL A STRONG INVERSION OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
LINGERING THROUGH THE NIGHT...WHICH SHOULD PREVENT MUCH VERTICAL

ALREADY REPORTING SOME FOG THIS EVENING...SO WILL PLAN TO MENTION 
PATCHY DENSE FOG THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. WITH THE EXTENSIVE 
CLOUD COVER AND DRIER AIR SLOWLY FILTERING INTO THE FORECAST AREA... 
THINK THAT THIS FOG SHOULD REMAIN PATCHY IN COVERAGE OVERNIGHT.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO

AIRMASS ALONG AND WEST OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU REMAINS UNSTABLE 
AND SHOULD SUPPORT CONTINUES STRONG TO SEVERE CONVECTION EARLY

AIR ADVECTION IS WEAK. LOW LEVELS REMAIN CAPPED SO CLEARING

.DISCUSSION...MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SHORT WAVE TROUGH ON THE MOVE WITH
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALING ENHANCED LIFT OVER NORTHERN
MISSISSIPPI. ASSOCIATED SURFACE WAVE ADVANCING NORTHEAST INTO
WESTERN TENNESSEE WITH NICE WARM SECTOR WITH PLUS 60 DEGREE
DEWPOINTS SPREADING NORTH INTO SOUTHWESTERN TENNESSEE. SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BLOSSOM OVER THIS AREA THROUGH 06Z AND WILL
BUILD INTO AND ACROSS EASTERN TENNESSEE AROUND 08-16Z. BEST
INSTABILITY PROGGED AROUND 09-15Z ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND FEW STRONG STORMS COULD TRANSIT THE
AREA DURING THIS TIMEFRAME. FORECAST ON TRACK WILL ADJUST TIMING
WORDING IN ZONES. BELIEVE TEMPERATURES WILL HOLD STEADY OR SLOWLY
WARM THROUGH DAYBREAK AS WARM SECTOR PRESSES INTO EASTERN
TENNESSEE...THEREFORE WILL ADJUST MIN TEMP WORDING.

.AVIATION...UPPER TROUGH DRIVING EAST THROUGH THE MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STREAMING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THE WARM
FRONT AND SOME LIFR/IFR CEILINGS PRESENT OVER SOUTHERN TERMINALS
BUT POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR RETURN TO MVFR CATEGORY WITH HEAVIER RAIN
LATER TONIGHT. POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION EXISTS WITH SOME
INSTABILITY PROGGED AROUND 06-11Z SATURDAY. ANOTHER PROBLEM FOR
FLIGHT WILL BE THE STRONG LOW LEVEL JET WHICH WILL CREATE WIND
SHEAR FOR THE FIRST SEVERAL HOURS OF THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...LOW LEVEL JET WILL INCREASE 
TONIGHT AHEAD OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT...BRINGING INCREASING 
MOISTURE.  WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY. 
SHOULD SEE INCREASING COVERAGE OF RAIN TONIGHT...WITH PRECIP 
DECREASING SATURDAY AFTERNOON BEHIND THE FRONT. WILL CARRY 
CATEGORICAL POPS BOTH PERIODS.  MODELS INDICATE SOME WEAK 
INSTABILITY LATE TONIGHT/EARLY SATURDAY...SO WILL MENTION CHANCE OF 
THUNDER ALL ZONES.  HOW MUCH INSTABILITY WILL BE PRESENT STILL 
UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME...BUT MAY BE ENOUGH TO COMBINE WITH STRONG 
LOW LEVEL SHEAR FOR SOME STORMS TO BECOME SEVERE MAINLY SOUTH AND 
WEST ZONES...AND IF ENOUGH INSTABILITY IS REALIZED COULD BE SOME 
THREAT OF AN ISOLATED TORNADO IN THESE AREAS.  WILL MENTION SEVERE 
THREAT IN HWO. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST A FEW 
TWEAKS.       

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...AS THIS PERIOD BEGINS 
THE FRONT AND PRECIPITATION IN THE SHORT TERM WILL BE EXITING TO THE 
EAST WITH HIGH PRESSURE FILLING IN.  HOWEVER...WITH A STRONGER 
SYSTEM QUICKLY APPROACHING FROM THE PLAINS...THE LOW LEVEL WINDS 
QUICKLY VEER IN A RETURN FLOW ORIENTATION DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY.  

THE FRONT FROM THIS STRONGER SYSTEM BLITZES THROUGH THE AREA VERY 
QUICKLY ON MONDAY...LOOKING LIKE FAIRLY EARLY ON MONDAY RIGHT NOW.  
BETTER CHANCES OF THUNDER EXIST SUNDAY EVENING.

LOOKING AT THE LATTER PERIODS...LOOKING LIKE A SLOW-MOVING SYSTEM 
LATE NEXT WEEK OVER THE MISSISSIPPI AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS...WILL 
NEED TO WATCH FOR THE POSSIBILITY LONG-DURATION RAINS OVER PARTS OF 
THE AREA DURING THIS TIME.  

FOR TEMPS...WENT ON THE LOW SIDE OF THE MAX TEMPS IN THESE LATTER 
PERIODS.

SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS EARLY TODAY. PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN CONTINUE 
ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AIDED BY ISENTROPIC LIFT. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD 
PERSIST THIS MORNING AND PRESS NORTHWARD DURING THE DAY AS FRONTAL

THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS. SHORT WAVE MOVES EAST THROUGH 
TENNESSEE VALLEY SATURDAY. CONVECTION SHOULD BECOME WIDESPREAD EARLY 
SATURDAY IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT. PRECIPITATION WILL 
TAPER OFF ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AS LAYER MOISTURE DROPS OFF BEHIND COLD FRONT. ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES CONTINUE AND STAYED CLOSE TO MOS BLEND.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOULD BE A QUIET WEATHER DAY 
TODAY WITH HIGH CLOUDS ON THE INCREASE AHEAD OF GREAT LAKES SHORT 
WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM. SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPS 
ACROSS THE REGION BOOSTING TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE 40S WITH LOWER 
50 DEGREE MAXES POSSIBLE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA. UPPER TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. 
TONIGHT DRIVING COLD FRONT THROUGH MOST OF THE VIEWING AREA. DEEP 
MOISTURE SOMEWHAT LACKING WITH THIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER THERE MAY BE 
ENOUGH PRESENT WITH A BIT OF FRONTAL/OROGRAPHIC LIFTING FOR A FEW 
SNOW FLURRIES ACROSS HIGH TERRAIN FEATURES IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS TEMPERATURE PROFILE BECOMES MORE 
FAVORABLE FOR SOME FLAKES. MODELS ALSO HINT AT POSSIBILITY OF LIGHT 
RAIN DEVELOPING ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS 
LIFTED ALONG THE FRONT. NOT CONVINCED PRECIP CAN FORM HERE AS BETTER 
DYNAMICS WITH SHORT WAVE WELL NORTH AND ONLY A SHALLOW LAYER OF 
MOIST AIR PRESENT.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A ZONAL FLOW IN THE MID AND 
UPPER LEVELS BECOMES SLIGHTLY MORE AMPLIFIED ON FRIDAY AS A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES FROM THE PLAINS TO THE OHIO VALLEY. AT THE 
SURFACE...A WARM FRONT WILL LIFT ACROSS THE AREA LATE FRIDAY AS THE 
SURFACE LOW MOVES INTO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY REGION. WEAK ISENTROPIC 
LIFT WITH THE WARM FRONT WILL BRING LIGHT PRECIP INTO THE AREA 
STARTING FRIDAY AFTERNOON. LIFT IS ENHANCED SATURDAY MORNING BY 
UPPER DIVERGENCE AND A 50 KT LLJ PROVIDING STRONG POSITIVE THETA-E 
ADVECTION. THERE IS SOME WEAK INSTABILITY AS WELL...WHICH SHOULD 
GIVE AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. THERE ARE SOME 
TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE SLOWER NAM AND THE FASTER GFS WITH 
THIS SYSTEM. PREFER THE FASTER SOLUTION GIVEN THE SHALLOW 
AMPLIFICATION OF THE UPPER TROUGH...BUT WILL KEEP SOME CHANCE POPS 
IN SATURDAY NIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY.  

TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN WELL ABOVE NORMAL ON SUNDAY AS A STRONG 
SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNS IN A HIGHLY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN. A DEEPER 
TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND GREAT LAKES SUNDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY...WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT CROSSING OUR AREA SUNDAY 
NIGHT. THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THIS 
PATTERN THAN YESTERDAY...AND THE SPREAD OF THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS 
IS SMALLER. WILL TRIM POPS BACK TO JUST SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY...WITH TUESDAY BECOMING DRY BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. A WEAK 
PUSH OF COLD AIR WILL BRING TEMPERATURS CLOSER TO NORMAL FOR 
TUESDAY...BUT A SOUTHERLY FLOW OF WARM MOIST AIR RETURNS 
WEDNESDAY...ALONG WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS.

.DISCUSSION...CLOUDS WILL BE THE MAJOR FACTOR FOR TONIGHT WITH A 
BAND OF LINGERING LOW CLOUDS OVER NE TN INTO SW VA. HIGH CLOUDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LEVEL JET STREAM WILL ALSO BE PASSING ACROSS 
OVERNIGHT...SO PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES FROM NORTH TO SOUTH LOOKS GOOD. 

FORECAST GRIDS GENERALLY ON TRACK BUT THE CLOUD COVER MIGHT AFFECT 
SOME HOURLY OR MIN TEMP GRIDS. WILL CHECK TEMPS LATE THIS EVENING 
AND ADJUST GRIDS IF NEEDED.

LOW CLOUDS FINALLY CLEARING OUT AND THIS TREND SHOULD CONTINUE
THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING...BUT VARYING AMOUNTS OF HIGHER CLOUDS CAN
BE EXPECTED TONIGHT AND THURSDAY AS SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY
MOVES ACROSS TONIGHT AND THEN A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THURSDAY.
SHOULD BE PRECIP FREE FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. MAV TEMPS LOOK
REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT...BUT WILL BLEND IN SOME GENERALLY LOWER MET
NUMBERS FOR HIGHS THURSDAY.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
WEAK COLD FRONT TO MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE WILL BE
QUITE LIMITED BUT A FEW SHOWERS/SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT.
ONLY SLIGHT ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED NE TN AND SW VA. LOWS WILL BE
NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE FREEZING. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN
FRIDAY AND CONTINUED MILD TEMPERATURES. DEVELOPING SYSTEM MOVES
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. ENOUGH
INSTABILITY FOR THUNDERSTORMS LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY WITH
SOUTHERN SECTIONS RECEIVING POSSIBLE HEAVY RAINFALL OF A COUPLE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLDER AIR BUILDING INTO THE 
REGION TODAY WITH A MASS OF POST FRONTAL STRATUS ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES THIS MORNING WILL GIVE WAY TO INCREASING AMOUNTS OF 
SUNSHINE IN MOST AREAS. SHOULD TAKE A LITTLE LONGER TO BREAK ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. A QUIET NIGHT IN 
STORE TONIGHT WITH A FEW HIGH CLOUDS AS WARMER AIR RETURNS ALOFT. 
STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A FAST-MOVING VORT MAX AT 
500 MB AND THE NOSE OF THE 300 MB JET PROVIDE SOME WEAK LIFT ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THURSDAY EVENING. HOWEVER MOISTURE 
IS LIMITED...SO WILL HAVE JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE POP THU 21Z TO FRI 
03Z NORTH. A WARM ADVECTION PATTERN SETS UP ON FRIDAY AS LOW 
PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS. STRONG ADVECTION OF HIGH THETA-E 
AIR AT 850 MB WILL BRING SHOWERS FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN FORCING REACHES 
ITS PEAK SATURDAY WHEN A NICE UPPER JET COUPLET ENHANCES DIVERGENCE 
OVER THE AREA. THERE IS SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY AS WELL...SO WILL 
ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS SOUTH AND WEST TO GO ALONG WITH 
LIKELY POPS. PRECIP CHANCES END SATURDAY NIGHT ONCE THE TROUGH AXIS 
MOVES EAST. WITH THE FLOW ALOFT BEHIND THE SYSTEM BEING NEARLY 
ZONAL...THERE IS NOT MUCH OF A COLD PUNCH BEHIND IT...SO 
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE BEGINNING OF THE 
WEEK. 

CONFIDENCE IN THE MODELS IS VERY LOW FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...AS 
THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SPREAD IN THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS...AND POOR 
RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY. THE OPERATIONAL GFS SHOWS MOST PRECIP ON 
MONDAY...WITH THE ECMWF AND SEVERAL ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ON TUESDAY. 
WILL CARRY A CHANCE POP THROUGH MOST OF THIS TIME FRAME. ABNORMALLY 
WARM TEMPERATURES APPEAR LIKELY TO CONTINUE BOTH DAYS.

GENERATE OCCASIONAL EMBEDDED THUNDER AND BRIEF MODERATE TO HEAVY 
RAIN AS THE NARROW BAND OF CONVECTION MOVES THROUGH.  THE STRONG 
WIND FIELD AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL MOVE OFF EARLY THIS EVENING AND 
WILL ALLOW THE WIND ADVISORY TO EXPIRE.  BEHIND THE FRONT...LOOK FOR 
IMPROVING CONDITIONS WITH DECREASING WINDS AND CLOUDS.  SURFACE HIGH 
BUILDS IN ON WEDNESDAY WITH A COOL...DRY AIR MASS MOVING IN FOR A 
QUIET WEATHER DAY WITH TEMPERATURES WARMING INTO THE 30S AND 40S.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...GREAT LAKES SHORTWAVE 
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WON'T BRING ANY PRECIPITATION TO OUR 
REGION IN THE FIRST FEW PERIODS...BUT WILL KEEP MIN TEMPS ON THE 
COOL SIDE RIGHT AROUND SEASONAL NORMALS. AFTERWORDS...MIN TEMPS 
MODERATE TO WELL ABOVE CLIMO...SO NO WINTRY WEATHER AHEAD FOR NOW. 
HIGHS WARM THROUGH THE 50S POSSIBLY INTO MID 60S...DEPENDENT ON HOW 
MUCH CLOUD COVER AND SHOWERS DEVELOP. 

THE UPPER FLOW STAYS SOMEWHAT ZONAL AND PROGRESSIVE INTO THE WEEKEND 
BEFORE AN UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS (POSSIBLY CLOSING OFF) OVER THE SRN 
PLAINS BY MONDAY. MODELS DIVERGE CONSIDERABLY FROM SUNDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY...WITH MORE CONTINUITY IN FOLLOWING THE GFS MODEL FOR NOW. 
THIS MEANS A MAIN PERIOD OF PRECIPITATION FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY 
WITH A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE...WHICH ECMWF ALSO SHOWS. MODELS 
TRENDING DRIER ON FRIDAY...ALSO NOTED IN SREF...SO POPS WERE JUST 
ABOUT DROPPED UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT. SOME UNCERTAINTY FOR WHETHER 
SUNDAY REMAINS DRY...BUT ECMWF LOOKS OVERDONE SO TRENDED WITH DRIER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...A DEEPENING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE TRACKING FROM MO TO SOUTHERN ONTARIO THROUGH 
THE DAY. SYNOPTIC LIFT IS NOT STRONG WITH A NEAR-ZONAL UPPER LEVEL 
FLOW...BUT A STRONG LLJ WILL TRANSPORT PLENTY OF WARM MOIST AIR INTO 
THE TN VALLEY...AND PRODUCE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY SOME THUNDERSTORMS. 
SOME LOW LEVEL FORCING ARRIVES LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
WITH THE APPROACH OF A STRONG COLD FRONT...AND WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL 
POPS WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER IN THIS TIME FRAME. THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE LOOKS TO OCCUR BETWEEN 00Z AND 04Z. MIDLEVEL DRY AIR BUILDS 
IN AFTER MIDNIGHT WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE 850 MB TROUGH. THE ONSET 
OF COLD AIR APPEARS TO BE JUST BEHIND THE EXITING MOISTURE...WHICH 
SHOULD PREVENT MUCH IN THE WAY OF SNOWFALL LATE TONIGHT. WILL HAVE 
JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE  OF SNOW SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS AFTER 
06Z...THEN END ALL POPS BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. 

SO FAR OBSERVATIONS OF WIND IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS HAVE BEEN 
MARGINAL FOR THE WIND ADVISORY...BUT WILL KEEP IT GOING AS THE LLJ 
PEAKS IN THE LATE MORNING AND WINDS ALOFT WILL BE MIXING DOWN A 
LITTLE MORE AFTER SUNRISE. THE STRONGER SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE CAPABLE OF BRINGING STRONG WINDS ALOFT TO THE SURFACE...AND 
A FEW SEVERE STORMS CANNOT BE RULED OUT.

A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND UPPER JET CROSSES THE AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY EVENING....THEN ANOTHER TROUGH PASSES JUST NORTH THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON. MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED WITH BOTH OF THESE SYSTEMS...AND 
WILL KEEP THE FORECAST DRY. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN 
AGREEMENT DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST WHICH HAS TWO ACTIVE 
PERIODS. INITIALLY AN UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES ACROSS THE CENTER OF 
THE NATION FRIDAY BUILDING EAST THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS ON 
SATURDAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE STRENGTHENING FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY 
NIGHT AS MOISTURE ADVECTION INCREASES AHEAD OF A SURFACE WAVE 
TRANSITING THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. ALLOWED FOR A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS ON THE PLATEAU AND ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE REMAINDER OF THE VIEWING 
AREA ON FRIDAY. MAIN LIFT AND DEEPEST MOISTURE IN PLACE FRIDAY NIGHT 
AS THE SURFACE WAVE SHIFTS EAST NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS SO EDGED POP IN THE LIKELY CATEGORY FOR THIS PERIOD 
WHILE DROPPING BACK TO CHANCE ON SATURDAY. HOWEVER...THIS MAY NEED 
TO BE PULLED BACK FURTHER IN SUBSEQUENT FORECAST ISSUANCE AS THE GFS 
IS A LITTLE QUICKER TO BRING DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION. BASICALLY 
KEPT SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY DRY WHILE AWAITING ARRIVAL OF A 
MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED SYSTEM. MATCHING NEIGHBORING WFO'S...WENT WITH 
THE FASTER GFS CONCERNING THIS FEATURE AND ADVANCED POPS FOR SHOWERS 
TO A LOW CHANCE CATEGORY WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AND 
SLIGHT CHANCE EAST SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
300 PM EST THU JAN 12 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG COLD FRONT ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU... 
WITH TEMPS IN THE 30S BEHIND IT OVER MOST OF MIDDLE TN. MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE PROGRESSION OF AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH OVER THE OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS TONIGHT...WHICH WILL 
CREATE MAINLY AN UPSLOPE SNOW EVENT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 
FRIDAY MORNING. AS A RESULT...EXPECT MOST OF THE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
TO OCCUR ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE BIG QUESTION WITH THIS 
SYSTEM CONTINUES TO BE HOW MUCH MOISTURE REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA BY THE TIME THE AIR COOLS ENOUGH FOR A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW. WITH 
SEVERAL DAYS OF WARM TEMPS...THINK THAT ANY SNOWFALL WILL HAVE A 
TOUGH TIME ACCUMULATING INITIALLY IN THE VALLEYS...BUT RAPIDLY 
FALLING TEMPS AFTER SUNSET COULD PRODUCE SOME SLIPPERY ROADS WITH 
BLACK ICE DEVELOPING FROM LINGERING MOISTURE FROM THIS AFTERNOON'S 
RAINFALL. AROUND AN INCH OF SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS STILL APPEARS 
POSSIBLE IN THE GREAT TN VALLEY...ALONG WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME 
BLACK ICE. THUS...WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE ADVISORIES AS 
ADVERTISED...BUT WILL EXTEND THE EXPIRATION TIMES A FEW MORE HOURS 
ON FRIDAY MORNING TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS. 
ANOTHER FAST-MOVING 'CLIPPER' SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT WITH LIMITED MOISTURE. THUS...IT 
APPEARS THAT A FEW SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VA...NORTHEAST TN...AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT... 
BUT WILL TREND TOWARDS THE COOLER GFS NUMBERS WHERE DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A STRAY LIGHT SNOW SHOWER MAY 
LINGER OVER FAR NORTHEAST LOCATIONS EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. 
OTHERWISE...WILL SEE A BRIEF WARMING AND DRYING TREND FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVES IN MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TUESDAY. THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS COULD HAVE LIGHT SNOW LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT...BUT MOST LOCATIONS SHOULD SEE SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS. 
THE SYSTEM WILL EXIT THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT WITH ANY RESIDUAL 
SHOWERS MIXING WITH OR CHANCING TO LIGHT SNOW OVER HIGHER TERRAIN 
OVERNIGHT. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM 
FOR A RETURN TO DRY CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED COLD 
FRONT EXTENDING FROM NEAR CHICAGO IL SOUTH NEAR TO LOUISVILLE KY... 
NASHVILLE TN...AND TUPELO MS. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...WITH TEMPS FALLING 
RAPIDLY AND WINDS INCREASING BEHIND IT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL BECOME HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED OVER THE 
OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS THIS AFTERNOON BEHIND THE FRONT... 
RESULTING IN A STRENGTHENING BAND OF POST-FRONTAL RAIN AS THE COLD 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. IT STILL APPEARS THAT RAIN 
WILL QUICKLY CHANGE TO SNOW OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BEFORE 
SUNSET...WITH THE CHANGEOVER OCCURRING A LITTLE LATER OVER THE GREAT 
TN VALLEY WHERE TEMPS SHOULD RISE INTO THE MID 50S AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE THIS MORNING MAINLY TO REMOVE ANY MORNING WORDING AND TO 
TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
411 AM EST THU JAN 12 2012

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS
SHOWS A STRONG COLD FRONT NEAR THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER WITH
TEMPERATURES FALLING RAPIDLY AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER FROPA. A STRONG
NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO
AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS TODAY AND TONIGHT. A 120KT+ 300MB JET WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE GULF COAST TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY
PLACING THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED LEFT EXIT REGION. THE
STRONG INDIRECT CIRCULATION WILL ENHANCE THE AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL
CIRCULATION RE-INFORCING THE FRONTAL-GENETIC FORCING. A BAND OF
PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING. INITIALLY...THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE RAIN...BUT AS
TEMPERATURE FALL QUICKLY BEHIND THE FRONT THE RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW.

AS UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE AREA...TEMPERATURE ALOFT QUICKLY
COOL WITH 500MB TEMPERATURES DROPPING TO -30C. THE COLD AIR ALOFT
WILL STEEPEN THE LAPSE RATES WITH FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOWING CAPES
OF 80-120 J/KG WHICH WILL PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SNOW SHOWERS. THE
HEAVIEST SNOWFALL WILL BE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT UP TO
1 INCH IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE NORTHERN-CENTRAL TENNESSEE VALLEY.
ALSO...EARLIER RAIN MAY QUICKLY FREEZE PRODUCING AREAS OF BLACK ICE.
THE SNOW SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH FRIDAY AS UPPER TROUGH LIFTS
NORTHEAST. 

BESIDES THE SNOW...THE STRONG PRESSURE RISES ALONG AND BEHIND FROPA
WILL PRODUCE WINDY CONDITIONS...SO HAVE ISSUED A WIND ADVISORY FOR
LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS SEEM TO BE 
CONSISTENT AND IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR THIS WEEKEND INTO THE MIDDLE 
OF NEXT WEEK. A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE/CLIPPER IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
ACROSS NORTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND EARLY 
SUNDAY...AND STILL WARRANTS JUST ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS AT THIS TIME. 
UPPER RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS EASTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY AND A RETURN 
OF SW FLOW IN THE LOWER LEVELS...WILL BRING A DRY AND WARMING TREND 
AHEAD OF THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS SHOULD 
RETURN ON TUESDAY...AS ALREADY DEPICTED IN PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS.
LIKELY POPS MAY BE JUSTIFIED FOR TUESDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LACKING 
TO GO ANYMORE THAN HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR NOW...SINCE THIS IS QUITE 
FAR OUT IN THE EXTENDED PERIODS. 

FOR TEMPS...FACTORING IN SOME POTENTIAL MEASURABLE SNOWFALL ACROSS 
PARTS OF THE PLATEAU...SW VA AND ANY MTN AREAS...LENDS CREDENCE TO 
UNDERCUTTING BOTH MINS AND MAXES (SLIGHTLY BELOW GFSX MOS) UNTIL THE 
SNOW IS LESS OF A FACTOR BY SUNDAY AND BEYOND.

335 PM EST WED JAN 11 2012

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER NORTHERN 
KENTUCKY NEAR LOUISVILLE...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED OCCLUDED FRONT 
EXTENDING SOUTHEAST ACROSS EAST TN NEAR KNOXVILLE AND THE SMOKIES. 
THIS OCCLUDED FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE NORTHEASTWARD THIS 
AFTERNOON ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...WITH A MARGINALLY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS ALONG IT SUPPORTING SOME TSTORM DEVELOPMENT. AN 
UPPER-LEVEL LOW (CENTERED NEAR CHATTANOOGA THIS AFTERNOON) WILL 
CONTINUE TO CREATE A COLD AIR MASS ALOFT WITH THIS FRONT...WHICH 
WILL LOWER THE FREEZING LEVEL TO AROUND 6700 FT MSL RESULTING IN 
SMALL HAIL WITH SOME OF THE STRONGER STORMS. THIS LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE MID ATLANTIC REGION BY THIS EVENING...WITH 
LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE 
NIGHTTIME HOURS. A STRONG COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY...WITH AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH BEHIND IT GENERATING STRONG LIFT ALONG IT. A SOLID BAND OF 
RAIN IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT DURING THE 
AFTERNOON...WITH THIS RAIN QUICKLY CHANGE TO SNOW OVER THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY LATE AFTERNOON WITH UP TO AN INCH OF SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE BY SUNSET. MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN AGREEMENT 
THAT THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL EXPERIENCE A CHANGE-OVER TO 
SNOW AFTER SUNSET THURSDAY EVENING. THE BIG QUESTION WITH THIS 
SYSTEM WILL BE HOW MUCH MOISTURE REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY 
THE TIME THE AIR COOLS ENOUGH FOR A CHANGE-OVER TO SNOW. WITH 
SEVERAL DAYS OF WARM TEMPS IN THE VALLEY...THINK THAT ANY SNOWFALL 
WILL HAVE A TOUGH TIME ACCUMULATING INITIALLY...BUT RAPIDLY FALLING 
TEMPS AFTER SUNSET COULD PRODUCE SOME SLIPPERY ROADS WITH BLACK ICE 
DEVELOPING FROM LINGERING MOISTURE FROM THE AFTERNOON RAINFALL. WITH 
ALL OF THIS MIND...WILL GO AHEAD AND ISSUE A WINTER WX ADVISORY FOR 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH THIS FORECAST PACKAGE...WITH THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ADVISORY BEGINNING LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON...AND 
THE ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST VA BEGINNING THURSDAY 
EVENING. FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A 
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF UP TO AN 
INCH OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH SLIPPERY ROADS FROM 
BLACK ICE ALSO POSSIBLE. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS A 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS WHERE 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ECMWF/GFS ONLY HAD MINOR 
DIFFERENCES DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST WHICH STARTS OUT DRY 
DURING THE DAY SATURDAY BUT ANOTHER...WEAKER CLIPPER SYSTEM MOVES 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SATURDAY 
NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING AND THIS FEATURE COULD PRODUCE SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES...SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND MUCH OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER. RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE EASTERN STATES LATER IN THE DAY 
SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY AS ANOTHER HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT APPROACH THE AREA. THE MAIN PERIOD OF RAIN 
WITH THIS FRONT WILL BE DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. BRACKETED EITHER 
SIDE OF THIS PERIOD WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO ACCOUNT FOR POSSIBLE 
TIMING CHANGES WITH THIS SYSTEM. THE LONG TERM STARTS OUT SEVERAL 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL BUT SHOULD JUMP BACK ABOVE NORMAL DURING THE 
SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY TIME FRAME.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A VERY DYNAMIC UPPER TROUGH WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY AND TONIGHT. A 300MB JET 
OF 120+ KTS WILL PULL NORTHEAST ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES PLACING 
THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED LEFT FRONT QUADRANT OF THE JET. 
THIS JET IS HELPING TO PRODUCE THUNDERSTORMS OVER ALABAMA EARLY THIS 
MORNING EVEN THOUGH INSTABILITY IS LACKING. ASSOCIATED FRONT WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTH THIS MORNING...CENTRAL AREAS EARLY AFTERNOON 
AND NORTHEAST SECTIONS BY EARLY THIS EVENING. MODELS SHOW ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY (CAPES 500-800 J/KG) AS COLD AIR ALOFT STEEPENS LAPSE 
RATES. SOUNDINGS SHOW ENOUGH INSTABILITY BETWEEN THE -10 TO -30C TO 
PRODUCE SMALL HAIL WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS. AN ISOLATED SEVERE IS 
POSSIBLE MAINLY FOR AREAS ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40.

FOR TONIGHT...UPPER TROUGH EXITS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...BUT 
MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW ISENTROPIC LIFT HELPING TO CONTINUE LIGHT 
RAIN OR DRIZZLE THROUGH THE NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN CHANGES MADE WERE IN 
THE FIRST 3 PERIODS OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST. MODELS IN VERY GOOD 
AGREEMENT ON STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION BY LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON.
THIS WILL SEND TEMPS SHARPLY DOWNWARD...WITH SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT...ENHANCED BY STRONG JET DYNAMICS AND FRONTOGENETIC 
FORCING. THIS LIFT ACTS UPON PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AS HIGH AS 
1/4 TO 1/3 OF AN INCH...SO POPS WERE INCREASED IN FAVORED AREAS 
WHERE ADVISORY SNOWFALL AMOUNTS ARE QUITE LIKELY TO OCCUR. PER 
COORDINATION WITH NWS NEIGHBORS (GSP)...TOO EARLY TO ISSUE A WINTER 
WEATHER ADVISORY JUST YET...BUT WILL HIGHLIGHT IN OUR HAZARDOUS 
WEATHER OUTLOOK.  

MAX TEMPS TO OCCUR THURSDAY MORNING THEN STEADY EARLY AFTERNOON AND 
FALLING BY 21Z. MOS MINS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT WERE TWEAKED IN LINE 
WITH MOS BLEND...WHILE COOLER GFS MOS MAXES FRIDAY SEEMED BEST 
CHOICE AS SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED. 

LATER PERIODS SEEMED GENERALLY ON TRACK...WITH A FLURRY EVENT 
POSSIBLE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...AS A CLIPPER TYPE 
SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS TO OUR NORTH. FOR NOW...I CHOSE TO KEEP OUR 
GRIDS DRY. UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN ON MONDAY...BUT ANOTHER SRN STREAM 
SYSTEM LOOKS TO BRING RAIN BY MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY. POPS ALREADY

ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT...A LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
MOVE THROUGH CHA (17-20Z) AND TYS (18-21Z). ENOUGH INSTABILTY THIS

OVERALL FORECAST TRENDS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK. CATEGORICAL POPS ARE
WARRANTED OVERNIGHT AS RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA FROM SOUTH TO
NORTH AS LOW PRESSURE TRACKS FROM THE LOWER MS VALLEY TO WEST TN
TONIGHT. GOOD UPPER DIVERGENCE ABOVE STRONG LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
ADVECTION WILL BRING PERIODS OF MODERATE RAINFALL. SOME WEAK
ELEVATED INSTABILITY WILL BE PRESENT LATE IN SOUTHERN AREAS...BUT
MAINLY AFTER 12Z...SO ANY POTENTIAL FOR THUNDER SHOULD HOLD OFF
UNTIL THEN. SOME SLIGHT UPDATES WILL BE NEEDED TO
TEMPERATURES AND EVENING WORDING WILL BE REMOVED...BUT NO SIGNIFICANT

RAIN WILL BE SPREADING OVER THE AREA FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST
THROUGH THE NIGHT AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY
TRACKS TOWARD THE AREA. CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED TO LOWER TO IFR AT
CHA BY 06Z AS THE RAIN MOVES IN. LIFR MAY BE POSSIBLE AT
TIMES AFTER 06Z WITH HEAVIER RAIN...BUT TOO VARIABLE TO MENTION AT
THIS TIME. A STRONG SOUTH WIND ALOFT WILL CAUSE SOME DOWNSLOPE
EFFECTS AT TYS AND TRI...WHICH SHOULD KEEP CONDITIONS MVFR OR VFR
THROUGH MOST OF THE NIGHT. BOTH SHOULD LOWER TO MVFR ONCE WINDS
ALOFT SHIFT TO A MORE SW DIRECTION DURING THE DAY. RAIN WILL TAPER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKING 
THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. WITH ABUNDANT MOISTURE AND   
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE FEATURE...WILL KEEP CATEGORICAL POPS FOR 
BOTH PERIODS. WINDS SHOULD ALSO INCREASING TONIGHT...MAINLY ACROSS 
THE HIGHER ELEVATION AS A LOW LEVEL JET PASSES. COULD SEE PERIODS OF 
HEAVY RAIN. BUT IT SHOULD BE TOO BRIEF FOR ANY WIDESPREAD FLOODING 
CONCERNS. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...INITIAL SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH MAKES ITS EXIT WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH CONSIDERABLE WRAP AROUND 
MOISTURE/LIFT ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE EVENING SO HELD ONTO HIGH POPS 
NORTH WITH SLIGHT THROUGH CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS SOUTH. MOST OF THE 
PRECIP COMPLETED AS DAYBREAK APPROACHES. NEXT UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES 
SOUTHEAST FROM THE WESTERN LAKES REGION INTO THE OHIO VALLEY ON 
THURSDAY. DEEPEST MOISTURE IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS SYSTEM ARRIVES 
DURING THE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS WITH IMPACT MAINLY 
ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE PROBLEM IS 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE PRECIP SHOULD REMAIN IN A SUPER COOLED MODE 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA UNTIL MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD 
KEEP PRECIP MOSTLY IN LIQUID FORM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TERRAIN 
ABOVE 4000 FT WHERE SOME SNOW COULD MIX WITH THE RAIN. BY EARLY 
THURSDAY EVENING TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR RAIN TO 
CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS AT ELEVATIONS AROUND 2000 FT AND HIGHER WITH 
A SMALL CHANCE FOR A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE VALLEY FLOOR 
IN CENTRAL EAST AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. HOWEVER...THE DEEPER 
MOISTURE WILL BE LIFTING OUT WHILE LIFT DECREASES AS THE EVENING 
PROGRESSES. THEREFORE...EXPECT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION MAY ONLY BE 
AROUND AN INCH IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. THERE WILL BE A LIGHT 
DUSTING ACROSS THE VALLEYS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE. KEPT A FEW SPRINKLES OF SNOW ACROSS A SMALL PART OF THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER THROUGH FRIDAY 
MORNING BUT PRECIP WILL HAVE ENDED ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE 
FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AS DRY ADVECTION OCCURS. MODELS STILL IN 
DISAGREEMENT ON STRENGTH/AVAILABILITY OF DEEPER MOISTURE WITH A 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH PASSAGE ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE 
NATION SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS 
FEATURE...MAINTAINED PERSISTENCE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR THIS PERIOD 
AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF MORE WELL DEVELOPED SYSTEM MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY. AFTER A CHILL DOWN OVER THE WEEKEND...WARM AIR ADVECTION 
AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM SHOULD KEEP PRECIP IN LIQUID FORM WITH THE 
EARLY WEEK SYSTEM.

.AVIATION...DENSE FOG HOLDING STRONG ACROSS MOST OF EAST TN AND SW 
NC AT THIS TIME...LEAVING BOTH CHA AND TYS NEAR OR BELOW AIRPORT 
MINIMUMS (1/4SM FG WITH 100 OR 200 FOOT CEILING). SCATTERED PATCHES 
OF LIGHT RAIN ARE MOVING EAST FROM NRN AL AND SRN MIDDLE TN...AND
THIS LIGHT RAIN MAY BRIEFLY IMPROVE CHA TO IFR CONDITIONS OVER THE 
COURSE OF THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. HOWEVER...I SEE NO IMPROVEMENT 
FOR TYS UNTIL MID MORNING. TRI MAY ALSO TREND DOWNWARD FROM MVFR
BEFORE IMPROVEMENT OCCURS AFTER 15Z TODAY.

THE OUTLOOK FOR THE LAST 6 HOURS (11/00Z - 11/06Z) WILL BRING MORE 
LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS AND LOWERING CIGS/VISBYS.

LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TRAPPED IN THE VALLEY. THERE IS SOME DRIER AIR
ALOFT ACROSS KY THAT MAY FILTER INTO THE AREA...BUT THE NEAR-

SHOULD RESULT IN IFR CONDITIONS OR LOWER AT ALL TAF SITES. HOWEVER
CONDITIONS MAY BE HIGHLY VARIABLE...PARTICULARLY UNTIL
MIDNIGHT...SO WILL CARRY A TEMPO THROUGH THE EVENING EVERYWHERE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...FRONT EXITS THE AREA EARLY 
TONIGHT. WILL KEEP HIGHEST CHANCE FOR THE EVENING HOURS.  FRONT 
PUSHES BACK INTO AREA LATE ON TUESDAY...SO WILL KEEP THE LOW POPS FOR 
THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON.  STAYED NEAR 
GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT FOR THE TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY SYSTEM. CONFIDENCE HIGH 
FOR A WET PERIOD WITH WARM ENOUGH TEMPS FOR AN ALL LIQUID 
EVENT...SO WILL CARRY MAINLY CATEGORICAL POPS BOTH PERIODS...THEN 
CHANCE SOUTH TO LIKELY NORTH WED NIGHT AS THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
PULLS AWAY.   UPPER TROUGH FORECAST TO DIG IN BEHIND THIS SYSTEM 
WITH A COLD FRONT PUSHING THROUGH THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT TIME 
FRAME.  WILL CARRY LOW POPS BOTH PERIODS...AND WITH COLDER AIR 
PUSHING IN ANY LINGERING PRECIP SHOULD CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS THU 
NIGHT.  MODEL/ENSEMBLE AGREEMENT POOR FURTHER OUT AND CONFIDENCE 
LOWER THAN AVERAGE FOR LATER PERIODS.  12Z GFS HAS A SIGNIFICANT 
SYSTEM AFFECTING THE AREA BY THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEKEND...BUT 
ECMWF AND CMC DO NOT AGREE...AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS HAVE 
CONSIDERABLE SPREAD.  GIVEN LACK OF SUPPORT FOR GFS AND ITS POOR RUN 
TO RUN CONSISTENCY WILL LEAN TOWARD THE DRIER ECMFW/CMC...AND FOR 
NOW WILL KEEP FORECAST PRECIP FREE FOR THE LATTER PERIODS THROUGH

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COOLING TOPS ON IR SATELLITE
PICS OVER THE ARKLATEX AREA INTO N MS AND W TN THIS MORNING...WITH
SHOWERS CONTINUING TO DEVELOP OVER MIDDLE TN NW INTO WRN KY. MODELS
SHOW THIS SHORTWAVE FEATURE MOVING NE TODAY...WITH MODERATE
ISENTROPIC LIFT SPREADING ACROSS THE BULK OF OUR FORECAST AREA
AFTER 15Z AND THEN DIMINISHING AFTER 21Z. THIS CERTAINLY SUPPORTS
THE HIGHER MOS POPS (COMPARED TO PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS)...SO POPS
WERE INCREASED OVER GENERALLY THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. WOULD HAVE
GONE ANOTHER 10 PERCENT OR SO UP...BUT KEPT SOME CONTINUITY AND
STAYED IN TOLERANCE WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. LATEST HPC QPF GRIDS
LOOKED GOOD.

THE APPROACHING SHOWERS (RAIN) FAVORED GOING BELOW MOS FOR MAX TEMPS 
TODAY...AND I ALSO NOTED THAT MOS HIGHS WERE A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES
TOO WARM ON SUNDAY. RAIN SHOULD DIMINISH BY THIS EVENING AND THEN
DRY WITH SOME CLEARING OVERNIGHT...AS DEPICTED QUITE WELL IN
PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. SOME CONCERN THAT PATCHY FOG COULD DEVELOP
WHERE CLEARING HAPPENS...BUT WILL TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH.
MINS FOR TONIGHT WHERE ADJUSTED UP A BIT IN LINE WITH 09/00Z MOS.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...TUESDAY STARTS OUT DRY
AS WEAK HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE OH AND TN VALLEYS KEEPS DRIER AIR
MASS OVER FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER DEVELOPING SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER
MS VALLEY WILL BEGIN TO MOVE EAST INTO THE SOUTHEAST AND TN VALLEY
DURING THE DAY SPREADING MOISTURE IN THE FORM OF CLOUDS INTO SE TN
AND SW NC AND THE PLATEAU BY AFTERNOON AND LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS
SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY BY ABOUT 00Z. SHORT RANGE
MODELS HAVE SURFACE LOW OVER WEST TN WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH PRE 
FRONTAL SHOWERS AND A POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORM OUT AHEAD OF THE
SYSTEM WEDNESDAY. LARGE AREA OF PRECIPITATION SHOULD MOVE THROUGH
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY EVENING WITH RAIN ENDING EARLY THURSDAY.
RAINFALL AMOUNTS FROM TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT MAY
TOTAL UP TO ABOUT 2 INCHES IN THE SOUTH. SECONDARY FRONT NOW
EXPECTED TO FOLLOW ON ITS HEELS THURSDAY AND THURSDAY EVENING. MUCH
COLDER AIR MASS TO FOLLOW SECOND FRONT WITH CHANCE OF SNOW THURSDAY
EVENING. AN INCH OR TWO POSSIBLE IN THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FRIDAY THROUGH

POST FRONTAL LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS. MAX TEMPS WILL STRUGGLE BUT MAY
BE ACHIEVED LATE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM....SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY
SEEMS TO BE STALLING ACROSS NE AL AND NRN GA EASTWARD ACROSS NC
THIS MORNING. SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS DEVELOPING OVER SRN MIDDLE
AND SE TN WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK EAST THIS MORNING...SO I NUDGED
POPS UP FOR SE TN AND SW NC TO LOW END OF LIKELY. MILD TEMPS AT 08Z
SO POTENTIAL IS THERE TO REACH 50S TO AROUND 60 FOR HIGHS TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL MOVE NE ACROSS THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...IN ADVANCE OF THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER 
THE SRN PLAINS. LOOK FOR SHOWERS TO BE ON THE INCREASE LATE TONIGHT 
AND SPREAD NE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA IN THE 06Z TO 12Z MONDAY 
PERIOD. 

FOR TEMPS...MOS TEMPS QUITE CLOSE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND 
GENERALLY FOLLOWED.

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...STALLED COLD FRONT OVER SE
TN AND SW NC WILL MOVE LITTLE MONDAY WITH SHOWERS LIKELY OVER MUCH
OF THE FORECAST AREA. BY MONDAY NIGHT THE FRONT SHIFTS SOUTH WITH
ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA.
DRIER AIR MASS AND WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL LIE OVER NORTHERN

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CLOUDS INCREASING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...AS AN UPPER TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE 
MOVES EAST ACROSS THE GULF COAST REGION AND A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES 
SLOWLY SE ACROSS MID MS VALLEY AND WRN OHIO VALLEY REGIONS. SEEING 
SOME SPOTTY WEAK RADAR RETURNS OVER MIDDLE AND W TN...BUT DOUBT IF 
MORE THAN SPRINKLES WILL REACH THE SURFACE INITIALLY OVER E TN. 
PREVIOUS POP/WX GRIDS LOOKED GOOD FOR THE VERY SHORT TERM...BUT I 
DID NUDGE SE TN/SW NC POPS UP TO LOW END OF LIKELY FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON. I THINK THE WEAK FRONT SLIPPING INTO THOSE AREAS AND 
DEEPENING MOISTURE JUSTIFY THE POP INCREASE. ALSO...DON'T LIKE TO 
RUN JUST CHANCE POPS GIVEN LATEST HIGHER HPC QPF AMOUNTS FOR TODAY.
HOWEVER...FURTHER NORTH OVER SW VA...I STILL LIKE THE 20 TO 30 
PERCENT CHANCE POPS. HARD TO DISAGREE WITH SIMILAR MOS HIGHS FOR 
TODAY...IN LIGHT OF CURRENT MILD TEMPS WHERE CLOUDS AND LIGHT SW 
WINDS WILL ALLOW A WARM START.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK FRONT SETTLES ACROSS OR JUST SOUTH OF SE TN/SW NC 
SO SOME PARTIAL CLEARING COULD OCCUR OVER NRN MOST AREAS. LIMITED 
RAIN CHANCES TO MAINLY AREAS SOUTH OF I-40 AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS. 
FAVORED GOING AT OR JUST ABOVE MOS FOR MINS OVER SRN AREAS TONIGHT
BUT GENERALLY CLOSE TO MOS FOR MINS IN THE NORTH.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT TO
HANG OUT TO THE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY.
MODELS BRING SHORTWAVE ENERGY NORTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA MAINLY
SOUTH SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AND THEN ANOTHER IMPULSE AREA WIDE
MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT. RAIN CHANCES LOW NORTH UNTIL MONDAY.
RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.
TEMPERATURES STILL MUCH ABOVE NORMAL SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.
ON TUESDAY A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BECOMES WOUND UP OVER THE LOWER MS
VALLEY AND THIS SYSTEM MOVES NE INTO THE TN VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT
AND WEDNESDAY. AFTER A LULL IN ACTIVITY TUESDAY SHOWERS INCREASE
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. AIR MASS BECOMES SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE
WEDNESDAY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS. A SECONDARY FRONT
THURSDAY WILL BRING IN A MUCH COLDER AIR MASS. SNOW SHOWERS
POSSIBLE AT TAIL END OF THIS SYSTEM BUT NO SIGNIFICANT
ACCUMULATIONS ACCEPTED. COLD HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN LATE THURSDAY
WITH LOWS FALLING INTO THE 20S AND HIGHS IN THE MID 30S TO MID 40S

PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK...BUT I DID SPREAD LOW POPS 
JUST A BIT FURTHER EAST LATE TONIGHT...AS ALL MODELS SPREAD VERY 
LIGHT QPF INTO ALL BUT FAR NE AREAS BY 12Z SATURDAY. GOOD WARMING AT 
850 MB LEVEL PLUS SUNSHINE FOR MUCH OF TODAY...SO FAVORED THE MILDER 
MAX TEMPS. MILDER MOS MINS ALSO GENERALLY BETTER CHOICE FOR TONIGHT 
AS CLOUDS INCREASE.

LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MILD TEMPERATURES CONTINUE 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION WITH GOOD 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS. THE FRONT STALLS TO THE SOUTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY. 
OVERRUNNING OVER THE FRONT WILL KEEP CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE

.SHORT TERM....SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ZONAL FLOW ALOFT
AND WARM SW-W LOW LEVEL FLOW...WILL PROVIDE A GREAT DAY TODAY WITH
HIGHS AT LEAST 10 DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS. LOW PRESSURE/TROUGH
OVER WESTERN GULF AND A SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT WILL BRING INCREASING
CLOUDS AND A CHANCE OF SHOWERS (MAINLY WRN AREAS) BY AND AFTER 06Z
SATURDAY.

PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK...BUT I DID SPREAD LOW POPS 
JUST A BIT FURTHER EAST LATE TONIGHT...AS ALL MODELS SPREAD VERY 
LIGHT QPF INTO ALL BUT FAR NE AREAS BY 12Z SATURDAY. GOOD WARMING AT 
850 MB LEVEL PLUS SUNSHINE FOR MUCH OF TODAY...SO FAVORED THE MILDER 
MAX TEMPS. MILDER MOS MINS ALSO GENERALLY BETTER CHOICE FOR TONIGHT 
AS CLOUDS INCREASE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MILD TEMPERATURES CONTINUE 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION WITH GOOD 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS. THE FRONT STALLS TO THE SOUTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY. 
OVERRUNNING OVER THE FRONT WILL KEEP CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE 
REGION WITH THE BEST CHANCES SOUTH THROUGH MONDAY. TUESDAY A 
STRONGER SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVE THE GULF COAST AND MOVES NORTHEAST 
ACROSS THE TN VALLEY WITH SHOWERS BECOMING LIKELY. POSSIBLY EVEN 
THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY. FRONT MOVES THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH 
COLDER AIR MOVING IN THURSDAY AND A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS BEFORE 
HIGHER PRESSURE MOVES IN THURSDAY NIGHT. MILD TEMPERATURES SEVERAL 
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

CONSISTENCY FOR THE WEEKEND AND BEYOND RESULTS IN LOWER THAN AVERAGE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE

MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS LINGERING 
CLOUDS OVER THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...ON THE BACK

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...UPPER FLOW PATTERN HAS BROUGHT 
A SHORT WAVE SE FROM THE GREAT LAKES INTO NORTHERN TN AND SW VA WITH 
SNOW SHOWERS MOVING ACROSS SW VA AND INTO NORTHERN TN. MOST 
LOCATIONS HAVE ONLY RECEIVED TRACE AMOUNTS OF DRY SNOW. TEMPERATURES 
AREA IN THE UPPER 20S AND 30S ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA WITH LOWER 40S 
AT CHA. CLOUDS HAVE STEADILY INCREASED DURING THE DAY BUT DUE TO THE 
SHOWERY NATURE SKIES ARE NOT COMPLETELY OVERCAST AND SKIES ARE STILL 
MOSTLY SUNNY IN THE EXTREME SOUTHERN SECTIONS. WINDS HAVE BEEN 
STRONG WITH SPEEDS GENERALLY 15 TO 25 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS. MODELS 
KEEP 850 MB WINDS AT ABOUT 30 KNOTS TONIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING WITH 
STRONGER SPEEDS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. HAVE ENDED THE 
ADVISORY AT 12Z INSTEAD OF 18Z WITH MAIN SHORTWAVE MOVING NE BY 
ABOUT 12Z TUESDAY THOUGH SNOW SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE A FEW MORE HOURS 
ACROSS NE SECTIONS. LOWS WILL BE THE COLDEST OF THE SEASON IN THE 
TEENS LOWER ELEVATIONS AND SINGLE DIGITS HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
MOUNTAINS. ARCTIC AIRMASS STILL AROUND TUESDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE 20S 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND NE AND 30S ELSEWHERE. CLOUDS WILL LINGER IN 
THE NE BUT BECOME SUNNY ELSEWHERE. WINDS WILL GRADUALLY SUBSIDE WITH 
WIND CHILLS NOT AS MUCH AFFECT IN THE AFTERNOON.    

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH MOST OF THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...AND REVEAL A DRY AND TRANQUIL PERIOD UNTIL THE 
WEEKEND. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY...BUT MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED 
ALONG WITH WEAK UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS. THUS...EXPECT DRY CONDITIONS 
WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND INTO THE WEEKEND. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS 
THEN PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...AND SHOULD 
GRADUALLY BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY JUST SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 
SUNDAY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO HAVE A BETTER RETURN FLOW OF 
GULF MOISTURE WITH IT...SO WILL MENTION A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS REVEAL 
SOME DIFFERENCES WITH THE POSSIBLE DEVELOPMENT OF A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OVER THE DEEP SOUTH. THE LAST COUPLE OF GFS MODEL RUNS HAVE 
NOT DEVELOPED THIS SYSTEM YET...WHILE THE LAST FEW ECMWF MODEL RUNS 
HAVE SHOWN INCONSISTENCIES WITH THE LOCATION AND MOVEMENT OF THIS 
SYSTEM. FOR NOW...WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SOLUTIONS 
BY MENTIONING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS ON MONDAY...AND THEN A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN OR SNOW SHOWERS FOR MONDAY NIGHT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH

415 AM EST MON JAN 2 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A SHORT WAVE WILL DROP ACROSS 
THE AREA LATER TODAY/EARLY TONIGHT...ACCOMPANIED BY A SURGE OF VERY 
COLD AIR THAT CONTINUES INTO TUESDAY.  WINDS WILL BE GUSTY FROM THE 
WEST/NORTHWEST TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT LOOKS LIKE SPEEDS SHOULD STAY 
JUST BELOW WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA.  WILL SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS AND 
FLURRIES AS LAPSE RATES STEEPEN AND LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES. 
WILL KEEP WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY AS IS FOR NOW...ALTHOUGH MAY SEE 
THINGS WIND DOWN A BIT QUICKER THAN CURRENT FORECAST.  WIND CHILLS 
WILL DIP BELOW ZERO AT TIMES OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN BY 
TONIGHT...AND WILL MENTION WIND CHILLS IN ADVISORY.   SHOULD SEE ANY 
LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS/FLURRIES END TUESDAY AND CLOUDS WILL 
DECREASE.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...AFTER THE DEPARTURE OF 
THE DEEP EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH DRIER WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGH 
THE WORK WEEK. HOWEVER...MODELS STILL DEPICT ANOTHER CLIPPER SHORT 
WAVE DROPPING SOUTHEAST LATER WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS 
SYSTEM STILL APPEARS TO BE LACKING SUFFICIENT MOISTURE FOR PRECIP 
ALTHOUGH KEPT THE INCREASING CLOUD TREND DURING THIS PERIOD AS THE 
FAST MOVING FEATURE SWINGS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE 
NEXT SYSTEM OF INTEREST WILL BE A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
THAT SHIFTS STEADILY EAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ACROSS THE DEEP 
SOUTH OVER THE WEEKEND. SUFFICIENT SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT SHOULD KEEP 
PRECIPITATION IN THE LIQUID FORM AS SHOWERS SPREAD ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. MODEL SOLUTIONS A BIT 
DIVERGENT AT THIS TIME RANGE WITH SOME TIMING ISSUES. ALSO THE UPPER 
LEVEL FLOW BECOMES PARALLEL TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A COUPLE WAVES ALONG THE FRONT. TRIED TO INDICATE 
BEST CHANCE OF RAIN SATURDAY NIGHT BUT MAINTAINED 30 PERCENT POP 
DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEKEND PERIOD DUE TO UNCERTAINTY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A COLD FRONT AND ASSOCIATED RAIN SHOWERS ARE JUST EXITING THE 
AREA...AND STRONG ADVECTION OF COLDER AND DRIER AIR IS BEGINNING. 
THE AIR MASS WILL REMAIN VERY DRY THROUGH TONIGHT...BUT MOISTURE 
DEPTH WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ON MONDAY AS THE UPPER TROUGH BECOMES 
MORE AMPLIFIED. AS THE UPPER JET PUSHES TO OUR SOUTH IN THE 
MORNING...A SURGE OF FRIGID MIDLEVEL AIR ARRIVES MONDAY AFTERNOON. 
VERY STEEP LAPSE RATES AND LOW LEVEL TRAJECTORIES OFF LAKE MICHIGAN 
WILL CREATE FAVORABLE CONDITIONS FOR SNOW SHOWERS...BEGINNING MONDAY 
AFTERNOON AND CONTINUING INTO TUESDAY MORNING. A 30 KT UPSLOPE WIND 
WILL ENHANCE LIFT AND ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
INSTABILITY AND UPSLOPE FLOW SHOULD GRADUALLY BEGIN TO MODERATE 
TUESDAY MORNING AS THE DEEP TROUGH MOVES EAST.

A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED FOR SW VA...THE 
SMOKIES...AND THE MOUNTAINS OF NE TN. BETWEEN 1 AND 3 INCHES IS 
EXPECTED IN THESE AREAS...WITH UP TO 4 IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. 
LOCATIONS ACROSS THE NORTHERN TN VALLEY AND CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COULD 
SEE A DUSTING. WIND CHILLS WILL BECOME A FACTOR IN THE MOUNTAINS 
MONDAY NIGHT...POSSIBLY AS LOW AS -10 DEGREES...AND WILL MENTION 
THIS IN THE WINTER WX ADVISORY. SUSTAINED WINDS TONIGHT AND MONDAY 
ARE EXPECTED TO STAY JUST BELOW WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA OF 26 
MPH...WITH GUSTS AROUND 35 MPH. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UPPER TROUGH BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT 
AS MODIFIED ARCTIC HIGH SLIPS EAST TO A CENTER OVER FLORIDA BY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. LOWS STILL IN THE TEENS BUT A CLIPPER SYSTEM 
MOVES EAST SOUTHEAST FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE EAST COAST. MODELS 
KEEP THIS FRONT DRY WITH MOSTLY MID AND HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE. SOME 
LOWER LEVEL MOISTURE NE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY OTHERWISE 
THE FRONT WILL REESTABLISH TROUGH OVER THE EAST AND MORE COLD 
TEMPERATURES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT THOUGH NOT AS COLD AS MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY. UPPER FLOW FLATTENS OUT THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE HANGING ON AND HIGH TEMPERATURES MODIFYING INTO THE 50S. A 
SOUTHERN SYSTEM MOVES NE FROM THE LOWER MS VALLEY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
THE EASTERN TN VALLEY SATURDAY WITH RAIN INCREASING SATURDAY THEN 
THE SYSTEM SLOWS WITH A BETTER CHANCE OF RAIN OVER THE REGION SUNDAY 
WITH THE FRONT RIGHT ON TOP OF THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES STAY 
WARM SATURDAY AND THEN COOL A FEW DEGREES SUNDAY.

VISIBILITY AND CEILING RESTRICTIONS FOR THE NEXT 1-2 HOURS AT

WILL TURN TO THE WEST AND BECOME GUSTY. CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY

A BAND FO SHOWERS HAS DEVELOPED IN A ZONE OF VIGOROUS LOW LEVEL
CONVERGENCE ALONG THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. 12Z OHX SOUNDING
SHOWS AN UNSTABLE LAYER UP TO 700 MB. ACTIVITY IS A BIT GREATER
THAN EXPECTED...SO POPS WILL BE RAISED WITH THE UPDATE.

430 AM EST SUN JAN 1 2012

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH 
TODAY...USHERING IN A SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT.  
LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE ENOUGH MOISTURE SURGING AHEAD OF THE FRONT 
TO ALLOW FOR SOME SHOWERS TODAY...SO WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS ALL 
ZONES.  LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE DRY TONIGHT...WITH MAINLY CLEAR 
CONDITIONS SOUTH BUT MORE CLOUDS EXPECTED NORTH IN THE COLD 
ADVECTION AND NORTHWEST FLOW.  SOME GUSTY WINDS EXPECTED TODAY AND 
CONTINUING INTO TONIGHT ESPECIALLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT LOOKS 
BORDERLINE FOR ANY WIND ADVISORY AND WILL NOT ISSUE AT THIS TIME.  
MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
AMPLIFY SIGNIFICANTLY ACROSS THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION ON 
MONDAY. THE TIGHT GRADIENT IN PRESSURE WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP 
TAP FRIGID POLAR AIR. STRENGTHENING COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. INITIALLY MOISTURE WILL BE RATHER SHALLOW IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH THIS SYSTEM BUT DEEPER MOISTURE WILL BUILD ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THE LATE 
EVENING HOURS AS A STRONG VORT MAX SHIFTS SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE 
WESTERN GREAT LAKES. INCREASED POPS TO GOOD CHANCE AND EVEN LIKELY 
LATER IN THE DAY INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS FOR SOME OF THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN ON THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER WHERE A STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW WILL 
LIFT THE MOISTURE GENERATING SNOW SHOWERS. THE CHILLY AIR ALOFT AND 
DEEPER MOISTURE MAY ALLOW FOR SNOW FLURRIES ACROSS MUCH OF THE GREAT 
VALLEY AND OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES IN SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE. EXPECT A LIGHT SNOWFALL IN THE PREVIOUSLY MENTIONED 
HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS ON THE ORDER OF ONE...TO POSSIBLY 2 INCHES IN 
SOME OF THE HIGHER PEAKS BY TUESDAY MORNING. THE UPPER TROUGH LIFTS 
OUT BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON ALONG WITH RAPIDLY DECREASING MOISTURE SO 
THE EVENT SHOULD BASICALLY BE OVER BY 18Z TUESDAY. A CLIPPER SYSTEM 
BUILDS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION ON 
WEDNESDAY WITH A REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR WEDNESDAY BUT MOISTURE 
APPEARS TO BE LIMITED AND WAS ABLE TO MAINTAIN A DRY FORECAST ALL 
THE WAY THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING HOURS FRIDAY. HOWEVER...ANOTHER 
SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE APPROACHES THE AREA LATE IN THE WEAK AND 
KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS GOING LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
INCREASED THE PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION TO 30 PERCENT ON SATURDAY 
TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SYSTEM.

STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
MAX TEMPS WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WHICH LOOK A LITTLE TOO 
OPTIMISTIC FOLLOWING THE DEPARTURE OF THE EARLY WEEK MODIFIED ARCTIC 
AIRMASS.
