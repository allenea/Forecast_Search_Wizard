1005 PM EST MON DEC 31 2007

.DISCUSSION...A COLD FRONT WILL TRACK ACROSS THE REGION 
TONIGHT...INCREASING WINDS ACROSS THE AREA.  BREEZY TO LOCALLY WINDY 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED WITH NORMALLY FAVORED LOCATIONS SEEING 20 TO 
NEAR 30 MPH SUSTAINED AND GUST OF 35 MPG...LOCALLY 40 MPG POSSIBLE.  
LACK OF MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT WILL LIMIT PRECIP. WITH 
MUCH COLDER AIR FILLING IN BEHIND THE FRONT...PRECIP MAY BEGIN AS 
RAIN BUT WILL SWITCH OVER TO SNOW...MAINLY FLURRIES.  THE AREA WITH 
THE BEST CHANCE OF SNOW WILL BE FAR NORTHERN LOCATIONS AND OVER 
HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW WILL AID IN THE DYNAMICS.  NO 
ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED BUT SOME FAVORED LOCATIONS COULD SEE A 
DUSTING BY SUNRISE.  ALL LOOKS GOOD THE CURRENT FORECAST WILL UPDATE 
TO REMOVE EVENING WORDING.

328 PM EST MON DEC 31 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND NEW YEARS DAY)...A COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED 
TO PUSH INTO THE CWA TONIGHT BRINGING SCATTERED PRECIPITATION AND 
BREEZY CONDITIONS TONIGHT.  BEST CHANCES SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...BUT ADDED LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE EVENING HOURS FOR OUR 
WESTERN COUNTIES WITH BETTER CHANCES FOR THE REST OF THE CWA AFTER 
MIDNIGHT AS THE FRONT PASSES THROUGH.  THICKNESS ANALYSIS INDICATE 
PRECIPITATION THIS EVENING WILL BE LIQUID AND CHANGING TO SNOW 
OVERNIGHT AS COLD AIR FILTERS IN BEHIND THE FRONT.  FRONT IS EAST OF 
THE AREA BY TUESDAY MORNING BUT A DEEP SHORTWAVE APPROACHES ON 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON.  WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST POPS IN THE NORTH WHERE 
THE BEST MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE.  WITH THE COLD AIR IN PLACE...SHOULD 
BE ALL SNOW ON TUESDAY.  THE BEST SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD HOLD OFF 
UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT.  WITH THE STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION EXPECTED... 
STAYED BELOW MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN WEATHER FEATURE 
WILL BE COLD AIR POURING INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND WEDNESDAY. FAST MOVING ALBERTA-CLIPPER SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TUESDAY NIGHT BRING WITH IT
COLDER AIR ALOFT. THE COLDER AIR ALOFT WILL STEEPEN THE LOW LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES WITH CAPES OF 50-100 J/KG PRODUCING SCATTERED-BROKEN 
SNOW SHOWERS. THE WAVE WILL ALSO STRENGTHEN THE NORTHWEST FLOW INTO 
THE MOUNTAINS ENHANCING NORTHWEST SNOWFALL. BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE 
IS SUFFICIENT TO PRODUCE 3 TO 5 INCH SNOWFALLS FOR THE NORTH AND 
CENTRAL EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE LOCALIZED 6 INCHES 
AT PLACES LIKE MOUNT LECONTE. WILL ISSUE A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR 
THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.

ELSEWHERE...SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS AND OCCASIONAL FLURRIES 
ANTICIPATED WITH LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING. WAVE MOVES QUICKLY EAST WEDNESDAY WITH 
SKIES BECOMING CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY FOR CHA EARLY...THEN TYS 
DURING THE AFTERNOON. EVEN SO...COLD 850MB TEMPERATURES BETWEEN -15 
AND -20C WILL PRODUCE BONE-CHILLING COLD. ADDING BRISK NORTHWEST 
WINDS IN THE MIX PRODUCES WIND CHILLS OF 8 TO 18 DEGREES ACROSS THE 
LOWER ELEVATIONS TO MINUS 5 TO 15 DEGREES C FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

ADVISORY FOR WIND AND POSSIBLE WIND CHILLS MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN...BESIDES THE SNOWFALL. WILL HIGHLIGHT IN AN SPS FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

AS SHORT-WAVE LIFTS NORTHEAST SO WILL LONG-WAVE TROUGH FOR THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY. A MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES IN STORE FOR THE LATER HALF 
OF THE WEEK AS THE UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL WITH A SERIES OF 
WEAK SHORT-WAVES MOVING ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
LITTLE TO NO PRECIPITATION IS ANTICIPATED GIVEN CONTINUED DRY AIR 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

1009 AM EST MON DEC 31 2007

.DISCUSSION...CURRENT SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATING PATCHY DENSE 
FOG STILL OCCURRING AT A FEW SITES IN THE CWA.  BUT WITH THE DRIER 
AIR EXPECTED THE FOG SHOULD DISSIPATE SHORTLY.  WILL UPDATE ZONE 
FORECAST TO REMOVE MORNING FOG.  THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST 
APPEARS ON TRACK...NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER THIS 
MORNING FOLLOWING YESTERDAYS LIGHT RAINFALL AND CLOUDY/DREARY 
CONDITIONS. HOWEVER...SEEMS TO BE JUST ENOUGH LIGHT W OR SW WINDS IN 
SOME LOCATIONS TO INHIBIT FOG FROM BECOMING WIDESPREAD...AND ALSO 
LOW CLOUD DECK IN TRI VICINITY HAS HINDERED FOG DEVELOPMENT. 
THUS...I OPTED AGAINST A DENSE FOG ADVISORY THIS MORNING...BUT WILL 
CARRY PATCHY DENSE FOG IN ZONES AND ISSUED A SHORT TERM FORECAST FOR 
THE FOG.

CERTAINLY MUCH MORE SUNSHINE ON TAP FOR TODAY...WITH MOS MAX TEMPS 
QUITE CLOSE AND ACCEPTED. INTERESTING WEATHER EVENT BEGINS LATE 
TONIGHT...BUT DONT SEE A GREAT THREAT OF ANY SIGNIFICANT WINTRY 
PRECIPITATION (PCPN) UNTIL AFTER 12Z TUESDAY...SO TRIMMED BACK POPS 
JUST A BIT FOR LATE TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY IN CENTRAL AND NRN VALLEY 
COUNTIES OF EAST TN. IN FACT...SNOW ACCUMULATIONS COULD BE DELAYED 
UNTIL TUESDAY EVENING AND OVERNIGHT...WHEN STRONG SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX 
SWINGS ACROSS. MOS MINS TEMP ALSO VERY CLOSE WITH NO REASON TO STRAY 
FROM.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAIN FORECAST PROBLEM IS
COLD AND NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS BEHIND INITIAL COLD FRONT EARLY 
TUESDAY. FLOW IS INITIALLY FROM THE SOUTHWEST AS LONG WAVE TROUGH 
SINKS SOUTH THROUGH THE MS VALLEY AND THEN THE TN VALLEY BY LATE IN 
THE DAY AND EVENING. BEST CHANCE FOR ACCUMULATION AFTER THE WARM 
TEMPERATURES OF LATE WILL BE TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY AS 
TEMPERATURES DROP BELOW FREEZING AND UPPER FLOW SHIFTS TO THE NW. 
WIND CHILL TEMPERATURES ALSO DROP BELOW ZERO IN SW VA AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS AS NW WINDS INCREASE AND TEMPERATURES DROP INTO THE 
TEENS. LOOKS LIKE SNOW ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR PARTS OF THE AREA AND 
WARNINGS IN THE NE TN MOUNTAINS AND PARTS OF SW VA TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. WILL ISSUE SPS TO HIGHLIGHT SNOW AND COLD 
TEMPERATURES. WIND ADVISORY ALSO MAY BE REQUIRED TUESDAY AND TUESDAY 
NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE AT SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL MODIFY COLD AIRMASS 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS TROUGH MOVES EAST. NEXT SYSTEM WILL SPREAD 
CLOUDS AND CHANCE OF RAIN TO AREA SUNDAY.

JET SEGMENT STRENGTHENING AHEAD OF THE TROUGH ACROSS THE TN VLY ON 
SUN. LITTLE CHANGE IN LOW LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES TONIGHT. HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS WILL STREAM NE ACROSS THE AREA IN UPPER SW FLOW. CURRENT DPS 
REMAIN FAIRLY HIGH BUT EXPECT SOME DRYING IN THE LOW LEVELS 
OVERNIGHT. LEANED ON THE COOL SIDE OF SIMILAR MOS MINS. ISENTROPIC 
LIFT THROUGH SUNDAY APPEARS VERY WEAK. 1000-850 MB REMAINS 
RELATIVELY DRY SO WENT BELOW MOS POP GUIDANCE FOR SUNDAY. MODELS 
RUNS HAVE BEEN VERY AGGRESSIVE WITH HIGH POPS FOR SUNDAY WITH BIG 
SPREADS IN THE ENSEMBLE DATA. RAINFALL AMOUNTS THAT DO OCCUR SHOULD 
BE LIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MAIN WEATHER FEATURE 
WILL BE DEVELOPING LONG-WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
NATION. A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES DIVING INTO THE MID-WEST WILL CARVE 
OUT A TROUGH OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL SPILL INTO THE 
REGION TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT PRODUCING A GOOD BET OF SNOW SHOWERS 
(ESPECIALLY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS) AND SNOW FLURRIES. 
ACCUMULATION OF SNOW IS POSSIBLE FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...GENERALLY IN THE ADVISORY RANGE...FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.

THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON...THUS FAR...WILL EFFECT THE ENTIRE

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD FRONT WORKING EVER SO SLOWLY 
THROUGH THE REGION THIS MORNING...HAVING PASSED THROUGH ALL BUT THE 
EASTERN MOST COUNTIES AT FORECAST TIME. SPOTTY TO SCATTERED LIGHT 
SHOWERS CONTINUE ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO SOME LOW POPS 
CARRIED OVER FOR JUST A FEW MORE HOURS. CURRENT TEMPS AND MOS 
FORECAST TEMPS FOR 12Z TODAY MUCH MILDER THAN PREVIOUS GRIDS...SO 
ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO REFLECT THIS. MAX TEMPS A BIT TRICKY GIVEN 
FRONTAL PASSAGE...MORNING CLOUDS AND AT LEAST WEAK COLD AIR 
ADVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. TRIED TO STAY CLOSE TO GFS MOS MAX TEMPS.

FOR TONIGHT...CLOUDS QUICKLY INCREASE ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT...
BUT 29/00Z MODELS AND ENSEMBLES DELAY ANY PRECIPITATION UNTIL MAINLY 
AROUND OR AFTER DAYBREAK SUNDAY. LOWERED POPS BASED ON THIS CHANGE. 
ADDED SOME PATCHY VALLEY FOG SINCE RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL SET UP 
EARLY TONIGHT BEFORE CLOUDS INCREASE AHEAD OF THE DEVELOPING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TO OUR SOUTHWEST. MOS GUIDANCE QUITE CLOSE FOR MINS 
TONIGHT...AND SAW LITTLE REASON TO STRAY FROM.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS A LITTLE SLOWER WITH 
BRINGING WAVE NORTH SUNDAY FROM THE GULF ALONG FRONT THAT PASSES 
THROUGH TODAY. HAVE LOWERED POPS ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
EXCEPT NORTH CAROLINA AND DELAYED START OF PRECIPITATION. SUNDAY 
NIGHT SKIES CLEAR AND WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRING A SUNNY DAY 
MONDAY. COLD CORE UPPER LOW DROPS SOUTH OUT OF CANADA BRINGING A 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY ABOUT 12Z TUESDAY. NEW 
GUIDANCE HAS TEMPERATURES ABOVE FREEZING TUESDAY EXCEPT MOUNTAINS SO 
ADDED CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS SOUTHERN AREAS. CHANCE OF SNOW WILL 
CONTINUE AS DEEPENING SURFACE LOW MOVES SLOWLY EAST TOWARDS THE 
NORTHEAST COAST OF THE US AND UPPER TROUGH HANGS OVER THE EASTERN 
STATES THROUGH WEDNESDAY. SEVERAL SHORTWAVES ROTATE THROUGH THE BASE 
OF THE TROUGH KEEPING THE FORECAST AREA IN A COLD NW FLOW PATTERN. 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AS TROUGH SHIFTS TO THE NE AND UPPER FLOW 
BECOMES MORE ZONAL. TEMPERATURES WARM TO NEAR NORMAL FRIDAY.

SOUTH OF MRX CWA TODAY. GOOD LOW LEVEL SWRLY JET ABOVE 3000 FEET 
STREAMING ACROSS THE AREA. 88D VWP SUPPORT WIND ADVISORY THIS 
EVENING. FAIRLY STRONG INVERSION BELOW STRONG WINDS HAS HINDERED 
WARMING TODAY AND HAS RESULTED IN FOG FORMATION. THIS SHOULD PERSIST 
AT LEAST TIL FRONTAL PASSAGE LATE THIS EVENING AND POSSIBLY ALL

BUILDS IN SATURDAY. AIRMASS HAS WESTERN SOURCE REGION AND IS NOT 
VERY COLD. SAT NGT THRU SUNDAY NGT...WENT WITH GFS SOLUTION RATHER 
THAN DRIER NAM. STRENGTHENING SW-NE JET ACROSS MID TN PROVIDES GOOD 
LIFT AND DRAWS MOISTURE NORTH INTO AREA SAT NGT THROUGH MID DAY SUN 
WHEN JET AXIS SHIFTS EAST OF AREA.    


.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE AREA 
BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR MONDAY.  A SHORTWAVE TRACKS INTO THE REGION

NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH AND THE 
MOUNTAINS WHERE THE BEST MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE.  THICKNESS ANALYSIS 
INDICATE SNOW FOR MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...BUT MOISTURE TOO 
LIMITED FOR SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS.  A DEEPER SHORTWAVE FOLLOWS 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...WILL KEEP LOW POPS FOR THE NORTHERN 
AREAS AND THE MOUNTAINS ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.  THICKNESS 
ANALYSIS INDICATE SNOW AGAIN.  WITH THE INCREASED MOISTURE 
AVAILABLE...SHOULD HAVE A BETTER CHANCE FOR ACCUMULATION SNOW... 
MAINLY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS.  SHORTWAVE EXITS THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY

.DISCUSSION...MINOR UPDATE TO LOWER MAX TEMPS N AREAS. LOW LEVEL JET
MOVING NE THROUGH E TN COUPLED WITH UPPER DIVERGENCE FOSTERING WIDESPREAD
CONVECTION. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW CLOUDS HAVE ONLY REACHED SE 
TN THUS FAR...WITH QUITE A DIFFERENCE IN CURRENT TEMPS FROM SE TN TO 
SW VA AND NE TN AREAS WHERE SKIES HAVE STAYED MOSTLY CLEAR WITH NEAR 
CALM WINDS. CLOUDS INCREASING QUICKLY THIS MORNING...SO A BLEND OF 
MOS MAX TEMPS PROBABLY BEST BET...ESPECIALLY GIVEN COOL START SW 
VA/NE TN AND THICKENING OF CLOUDS FOR SE TN AND PLATEAU COUNTIES.

LITTLE CHANGES MADE TO POPS OR TIMING OF SHOWERS AND CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS...AS PREVIOUS GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK. DEW POINT TEMPS 
HAVE TO RISE A GOOD DEAL...AND SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY IS VERY 
LIMITED (ALTHOUGH ELEVATED INSTABILITY LINGERS INTO THE EVENING).
DAY ONE CONVECTIVE OUTLOOK HAS SHIFTED SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE STORMS 
TO OUR SOUTH...BUT WILL CONTINUE A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS AND SOME 
POTENTIAL FOR GUSTY WINDS AS FRONT APPROACHES AND WITH ANY STRONG 
STORMS. STRENGTH OF LOW LEVEL JET FROM MID AFTERNOON THROUGH FRONTAL 
PASSAGE JUSTIFIES A WIND ADVISORY FOR MOST OF OUR MTN COUNTIES ALONG 
EAST TN AND NORTH CAROLINA LINE. ISSUED THIS ALREADY SINCE THIS IS A 
LATE FIRST AND EARLY SECOND PERIOD FEATURE. 

OTHERWISE...CLOSELY FOLLOWED PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR LATE TONIGHT FOR ALL 
ELEMENTS...AND WENT CLOSE TO MOS BLEND FOR MIN TEMPS. 

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK IN 
WITH SKIES CLEARING AS FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES EAST. AS HIGH IS FROM 
THE SOUTHWEST TEMPERATURES STAY MILD. A WAVE ALONG THE FRONT TO THE 
SOUTH WILL SPREAD MOISTURE BACK NORTH SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY FOR 
A CHANCE OF SHOWERS WITH SOME SNOW POSSIBLY SW VA AND NE TN. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL BE MILD. MONDAY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN 
AGAIN FOR ANOTHER MILD DAY. MONDAY A DEEP UPPER LOW DROPS SOUTH OUT 
OF SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA AN INITIAL COLD FRONT MONDAY EVENING WILL 
BRING A CHANCE OF SNOW AS THE LEADING EDGE OF A VERY COLD AIRMASS 
MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. MORE MOISTURE ROTATING AROUND THE 
LARGE UPPER LOW AND THEN AS THE LOW DEVELOPS INTO A DIGGING UPPER 
TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY THE  CHANCES FOR SNOW 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MOSTLY 
30S AND LOWER THROUGH WEDNESDAY. UPPER TROUGH AND WEATHER MOVES OUT 
THURSDAY AND TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM SEVERAL DEGREES.

.DISCUSSION...
SKIES ARE CLEAR OVER THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA THIS EVENING...WITH CLODUY SKIES IN THE PLATEAU AND
SOUTHERN VALLEY. A SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD KEEP
MOISTURE CONFINED TO THE SOUTH AND WEST...WHILE WEAK DOWNSLOPING
SHOULD PREVENT THE CLOUDS FROM WORKING THEIR WAY FARTHER NORTH AND
EAST. AS A RESULT OF THE CLEARING...TEMPS HAVE DROPPED BELOW
FORECAST NORTH AND CENTRAL. THE UPDATE WILL ADJUST TEMPS AND SKY
COVER. LATEST MODEL RUNS SHOW THE DEEP MOISTURE HOLDING TO THE WEST
OF OUR AREA BEFORE 12Z...AND SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS THE SYSTEM IS
STILL WELL TO THE WEST...SO THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE SW TONIGHT

322 AM EST THU DEC 27 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PATCH OF RAIN SHOWERS MOVING 
NORTHEAST AND DISSIPATING RAPIDLY, LARGELY OUT OF AREA, THOUGH SOME 
VERY LIGHT SHOWERS OR DRIZZLE MAY STICK AROUND FOR A FEW HOURS, 
UNDER THE RADAR. IN WATER VAPOR IMAGERY, DRY SLOT FROM SOUTHWEST NOT 
OVER AREA WITH DRIEST AIR STILL TO COME THIS AFTERNOON. STILL, LOW 
LEVEL RH VERY HIGH AND SO STRATOCU WILL STILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY 
CLOUDY, UNTIL  MID AFTERNOON. EXPECT SOME SUN AS IT FINALLY ERODES 
THE TOPS OF THE SC DECK. 

NAM SHOWS CURRENT SHORT WAVE LIFTING OUT TO NORTHEAST AND BEING 
REPLACED BY A NARROW RIDGE TODAY. BY ABOUT 03Z TONIGHT, NEXT SHORT 
WAVE STARTING TO MOVE IN, THOUGH ITS NOT SO ROBUST, YET. A 
SPLATTERING OF VORTICITY WILL APPROACH THE AREA BY ABOUT 6Z BUT WILL 
ONLY SUFFICE TO PRODUCE ANOTHER ROUND OF CLOUDS BY THIS TIME. EVEN 
BY 12Z FRIDAY DO NOT EXPECT MUCH PRECIP. HAVE ADJUSTED POPS UP JUST 
A HAIR BETWEEN 6-12Z ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHWEST BUT ONLY TO LOW 
CHANCE LEVELS. 

DO NOT EXPECT THUNDER WITH THIS SYSTEM IN THIS TIME FRAME. CAPE AS 
WELL AS LIS VERY LOW.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AN ACTIVE EXTENDED PERIOD.
STARTING WITH FRIDAY...ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE OHIO
VALLEY WITH STRONGER CYCLO-GENESIS MOVING THROUGH KENTUCKY FRIDAY.
TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE
AFTERNOON-EARLY EVENING. STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER JET OF 50+ KNOTS
WILL BRING IN UNSEASONABLY MOIST AIR IN THE LOWER LEVELS WITH VERY
STRONG SHEAR AS WELL. CAPES APPROACH 500 J/KG AT CHA AND 300 J/KG
AT TYS LATE IN THE DAY. ANY CONVECTION HAS THE CHANCE (ESPECIALLY
CONVECTION WITH STRONGER UPDRAFTS) OF PULLING THE HIGH WINDS TO THE
SURFACE. SPC HAS INCLUDED A GOOD PART OF THE AREA UNDER A SLIGHT
RISK FOR FRIDAY. HAVE INTRODUCED A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS DURING
THE AFTERNOON.

RIDGING PULLS INTO THE AREA FOR SATURDAY...BUT ANOTHER FAST
SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE AND PRESSURE FALLS ASSOCIATED WITH RIGHT
ENTRANCE OF 130KNOT 300MB JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL INCREASE
THE ISENTROPIC LIFT FOR LATE SAT-SUN. GREATEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL
BE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...A DEVELOPING LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WILL PULL THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. PLENTY OF WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE AND
COLD AIR (850MB TEMPERATURES BETWEEN -14 AND -20C) TO PRODUCE A
CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES BOTH TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...
ESPECIALLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE TRACKING TO THE 
NORTHEAST...BRINGING PRECIP INTO OUR AREA TONIGHT. PRECIP APPEARS TO 
BE ASSOCIATED MAINLY WITH A COLD FRONT ALOFT AND MIDLEVEL 
FRONTOGENESIS. POSITIVE 700 MB THETA-E ADVECTION BEGINS TO MOVE INTO 
THE WESTERN PART OF OUR AREA AROUND 03Z...AND WILL BRING POPS UP TO 
LIKELY IN THE WEST AT THAT TIME. WILL RAISE POPS TO CATEGORICAL WEST 
AND CENTRAL AFTER 06Z AS THE CFA PASSES THROUGH...ALONG WITH SOME 
UPPER LEVEL DIFFLUENCE. THE BEST DYNAMICS DO PASS JUST TO THE NORTH 
AND HIGH THETA-E AIR AT 850 MB REMAINS TO OUR SOUTH...AND THE SYSTEM 
MOVES THROUGH QUICKLY...SO EXPECT QPF AROUND QUARTER INCH MAX. 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE MOUNTAINS MAY BE IN THE MID 30S AT THE 
ONSET...SO A LITTLE SNOW CANNOT BE RULED OUT...BUT WARM ADVECTION 
SHOULD QUICKLY CHANGE IT TO ALL RAIN. PRECIP SHOULD END ACROSS THE 
AREA BY AROUND 12Z WITH THE UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE AND ADVECTION OF 
DRY AIR IN THE MID/UPPER LEVELS. SOME LOW CLOUDS MAY LINGER IN THE 
SOUTH AS THE NEAR-SURFACE FLOW REMAINS FROM THE SOUTHEAST. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THERE REMAINS 
SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN MODEL AND RUN CONSISTENCY AND CONFIDENCE 
QUITE LOW THROUGH THE EXTENDED.  HOWEVER...FIRST HALF OF THE PERIOD 
SHOULD BE UNSETTLED.  STRONGEST OF INCOMING SYSTEMS WILL BE A COLD 
FRONT PUSHING THROUGH THE REGION AROUND THE FRIDAY TIME FRAME.  FOR 
THE WEEKEND...A DECENT SHORT WAVE WILL TRACK FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO 
INTO THE CAROLINAS...POSSIBLY CLIPPING THE MRX CWA...ESPECIALLY 
SOUTHERN AND EASTERN AREAS.  FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED...AN UPPER 
TROUGH SLIDES INTO THE EASTERN U.S.  MAIN MOISTURE AND LIFT 
CURRENTLY APPEAR TO REMAIN TO OUR NORTH AND HAVE THEREFORE LEFT 
MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY DRY...THOUGH HAVE KEPT SOME LOW POPS 
NORTHERN 2/3RD ON TUESDAY NIGHT.  MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS TROUGH WILL 
BE COOLER AIR PUSHING IN AND LOWING TEMPERATURES TO MORE SEASONAL 
LEVELS.

331 AM EST WED DEC 26 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LOW QUITE VISIBLE IN WATER 
VAPOR IMAGERY, CENTERED JUST NORTHEAST OF ATLANTA AND MOVING 
NORTHEAST RAPIDLY. CLOUD TOPS ARE IN THE 35K FEET RANGE JUST TO THE 
EAST OF OUR AREA, WITH TOP TEMPS AROUND -52C, COLD ENOUGH TO PRODUCE 
THE SNOW APPEARING IN THE OBS OVER THERE. HOWEVER, FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT 
DOWNSLOPING HAS BEEN OCCURRING OVER THE MOUNTAINS TO THE EAST 
TENNESSEE SIDE. SOME RAIN HAS FALLEN, BUT MAINLY ITS CLOUDS. WEAK 
INVERTED TROUGH SITS OVER EAST TENNESSEE, AND HAS DEEPENED A LITTLE 
BUT EXPECT IT WILL MOVE WITH UPPER LOW.

NAM HAS UPPER LOW A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH THAN I THINK IT IS, AND HAS 
IT MOVING A LITTLE EAST OF WHERE I WOULD MOVE IT THROUGH TONIGHT. 
NOT FAR THOUGH. AS A RESULT, THE NAM RH FIELDS SEEM TO DRY THE AIR 
OUT A LITTLE MUCH IN MY OPINION FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. HAVE 
THEREFORE KEPT A FEW MORE CLOUDS IN THROUGH TONIGHT THAN THE MODEL 
SEEMS TO DEPICT. HAVE KEPT POPS HIGH (LIKELY) IN THE FAR NORTHEAST 
PART OF THE FORECAST AREA, WITH CHANCE IN MOST OF NORTHEAST TN AND 
EXTREME SOUTHWEST VA. POPS DROP OFF RAPIDLY TOWARD THE CENTRAL 
VALLEY GOING TO SINGLE DIGITS BEFORE HITTING CHATTANOOGA AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A BUSY EXTENDED PERIOD WITH NEXT
STRONGER UPPER TROUGH MOVING OUT OF THE ROCKIES THURSDAY NIGHT. ASSOCIATED
CYCLO-GENESIS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE WESTERN OHIO VALLEY INTO THE GREAT
LAKES FRIDAY WITH TRAILING COLD FRONT PULLING THROUGH FORECAST AREA BY
EVENING. LIKELY CHANCES OF SHOWERS ANTICIPATED WITH FROPA. RIDGING
BEHIND SYSTEM WILL PRODUCE A DRY DAY FOR SATURDAY. 

FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...STALLED FRONT ACROSS THE GULF COAST
STATES COMBINED WITH ANOTHER FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE WILL INCREASE
THE ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. RIGHT ENTRANCE
REGION OF JET ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PRODUCE DIFFLUENCE ALOFT
AS WELL ENHANCING LIFT.

WEAK RIDGING WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR MONDAY WITH A NORTHERN
STREAM WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES PULLING A COLD FRONT
SOUTH OVER THE AREA BY TUESDAY.

330 PM EST TUE DEC 25 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CLOUDS HAVE INCREASED 
RAPIDLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL FORECAST AREA WITH LIGHT 
RAIN AND SOME SLEET DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON. THIS HAS HAD A BIG 
AFFECT ON TEMPERATURES TODAY AS WELL WITH READINGS IN THE UPPER 30S 
TO LOWER 40S SOUTH AND MID 40S TO MID 50S ELSEWHERE. DEW POINTS ARE 
STILL IN THE MID 20S WHERE IT HAS NOT RAINED AND IN THE LOWER TO MID 
30S IN RAIN AREAS. UPPER LOW OVER THE MS/AL BORDER HAS DEVELOPED 
MORE AND FASTER THAN EXPECTED WITH THE NAM TAKING IT MOSTLY EAST 
ACROSS AL AND GA THIS EVENING AND INTO THE WESTERN CAROLINAS EARLY 
WEDNESDAY WITH SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION WITH IT. THE GFS MODEL IS 
NOT AS DEVELOPED AND KEEPS THE PRECIPITATION CLOSER TO THE 
MOUNTAINS. THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY SHOULD BE 
THIS AFTERNOON WITH AXIS SHIFTING MORE TOWARD THE MOUNTAINS THIS 
EVENING. SOUNDINGS SHOW PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE MOSTLY RAIN SOUTH 
BUT WHERE THERE IS COLDER DRIER AIR NORTH THERE IS A BETTER CHANCE 
OF SNOW AND AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS. GRIDS ONLY SHOW MINOR 
ACCUMULATIONS OVERNIGHT. SYSTEM PULLS OUT WEDNESDAY MORNING WITH 
TEMPERATURES WARMING BACK TO THE 50S AND CLOUDS SLOWLY 
DECREASING.     

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODEL CONSISTENCY 
RATHER POOR...BUT GENERALLY LOOKING AT A RATHER UNSETTLED WEATHER 
PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED.  TIMING ON THE GFS CURRENTLY SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT PROGGED THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT....A STRONGER SYSTEM 
ON FRIDAY...A SHORT WAVE WITH MAIN MOISTURE AND ENERGY KEEP TO OUR 
SOUTH AND EAST DURING THE WEEKEND...AND FINALLY ANOTHER SYSTEM 
APPROACHING THE REGION AROUND THE TUESDAY TIME FRAME.  WILL TREND 
TOWARD THIS TIMING THOUGH CONFIDENCE IN TIMING AND ACTUAL TRACK OF 
EACH DISTURBANCE IS QUITE LOW.  TEMPERATURE PROFILES THROUGH THE 
PERIOD SHOULD KEEP PRECIP AS RAIN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF AN 
OCCASIONAL RAIN/SNOW MIX OR BRIEF LIGHT SNOW OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
DURING THE SOME OVERNIGHT EVENTS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
AREA WILL DRIFT NORTHEAST DURING THE SHORT TERM.  MODELS HAVE FLIP 
FLOPPED ON WEAK SYSTEM FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  PREVIOUS 
TREND HAD BEEN DRIER...WITH MOISTURE STAYING MAINLY EAST.  LATEST 
RUNS NOW CUTTING UPPER SYSTEM OFF A BIT FURTHER WEST...AND BRINGING 
MORE MOISTURE TO OUR AREA...EVEN THOUGH BULK OF PRECIP STILL STAYS 
TO OUR EAST.  WILL INCREASE CLOUDS CONSIDERABLY FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND LOOKS LIKE SOME LIGHT PRECIP MAY WORK ITS WAY INTO OUR 
AREA.  WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW A GFS/NAM BLEND...AND FOR NOW 
WILL KEEP LOW POPS CONFINED TO THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST ZONES THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT. THERMAL PROFILES INDICATE 
THERE MAY BE SOME LIGHT SNOW OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...ESPECIALLY 
TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL ONLY MAKE A 
FEW MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.   

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A BIT TRICKY SCENARIO
AS FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN DEVELOPS AND SENDS WAVE AFTER WAVE
OVER US IN SOUTHWEST FLOW. TEMPS WILL BE WARMER THAN NORMAL AND SO
SNOW NOT REALLY A FACTOR, EXCEPT PERHAPS IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN, IN
THE COLDEST PART OF THE EARLY MORNING, ASSUMING AMPLE CLOUDS, AND
THEN ONLY VERY BRIEFLY, WITH NO ACCUMULATIONS.

FIRST SHORT WAVE MOVES QUICKLY ACROSS WEDNESDAY TAKING MOST OF THE 
CLOUDS WITH IT AND PRODUCING ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN, BUT THE 
RESPITE IS SHORT LIVED AS ANOTHER WAVE MOVES INTO THE AREA EARLY 
THURSDAY AND QUICKLY CROSSES THE REGION, WITH ABOUT THE SAME RESULTS 
AS THE WEDNESDAY STORM.  FRIDAY IS ANOTHER MATTER AS THE SYSTEM 
AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL DRIVE UP RHS AND PRECIPITABLE WATER 
AMOUNTS WILL RANGE FROM ONE INCH IN THE NORTHEAST TO ABOUT 1.25 IN 
THE SOUTHWEST NEAR CHATTANOOGA. THIS, COUPLED WITH A LITTLE 
MID-LEVEL DYNAMICS AND A WEAK JET STREAK TO THE NORTH WILL ALLOW 
MODERATE RAIN AMOUNTS, ESPECIALLY IN THE MORNING. AGAIN, THINGS MOVE 
QUICKLY OUT AND POPS DROP BY LATE AFTERNOON BACK DOWN TO LOW 
CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE. EVEN WITH PASSAGE OF COLD FRONT, TEMPS WILL 
NOT MODERATE MUCH AS THE AIRMASS ORIGINATES IN THE PACIFIC. 
PERSISTENT CLOUDS WILL KEEP MINS UP OVERNIGHT.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND CHRISTMAS)...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES AT
THE SURFACE WITH A NEGATIVELY TILTED WEAK UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPING
OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES THIS AFTERNOON. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW
ALOFT WAS BRINGING MOISTURE FROM THE WESTERN GULF INTO THE SOUTHERN
MS VALLEY AND SOME HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDINESS INTO THE TN VALLEY
INCLUDING THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WAS KEEPING TEMPERATURES DOWN
SLIGHTLY ALTHOUGH DRY AIR IN PLACE WAS KEEPING DEWPOINTS IN THE
UPPER TEENS TO LOWER 20S. NAM/GFS AND CLOSE OFF TROUGH ACROSS MS
AND AL TUESDAY AND BRING IN MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTH OVER THE
FORECAST AREA CHRISTMAS DAY. CROSS SECTION DATA INDICATE MID AND
HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE WITH SOME WEAK LATE IN THE DAY MAINLY EASTERN
MOUNTAINS. WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR NOW WITH JUST VARIABLE
CLOUDINESS. WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE TONIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL DROP
BELOW FREEZING EXCEPT NEAR FREEZING SOUTHERN VALLEY. HIGHS
CHRISTMAS SIMILAR TO TODAY WITH MORE CLOUDS DUE TO UPPER SYSTEM
MOVING THROUGH.

.LONG TERM (CHRISTMAS EVENING THROUGH MONDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE FROM 
PREVIOUS PACKAGE. LARGER FEATURES ARE SHORT WAVE OVER DEEP SOUTH BUT 
HAS LITTLE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH. AFTER THIS EXITS AREA LATER 
WEDNESDAY, SHORT WAVE RIDGING SETS UP, ALSO DRY, THROUGH EARLY 
THURSDAY. PREDOMINANTLY SOUTHWEST FLOW SETS UP AFTER WITH SMALL 
WIGGLES PASSING OVER AREA. A SERIES OF THESE WILL ATTRACT ENOUGH 
MOISTURE AND LIFT TO PRODUCE ISOLATED SHOWERS ON THURSDAY THROUGH 
ROUGHLY THE WEEKEND. HOWEVER, THE BIGGEST CHANCES WILL OCCUR ON THE 
WEEKEND, AND EVEN THESE ARE BY NO MEANS CERTAIN. POPS IN THE MID 
CHANCE RANGE (40ISH) MOST PLACES. THERE ARE GAPS IN THE TRAIN OF 
SHORT WAVES WHICH WILL DETERMINE WHEN THE RAIN FALLS, BUT THESE GAPS 
ARE ON THE ORDER OF A FEW HOURS AND TOO FINE DETAIL TO ACCURATELY 
FORECAST. HENCE, A BIT OF A BROAD BRUSH IN THE POPS AND CLOUD COVER 
THU-SUN.  SOME SIGNS OF DRYING AGAIN ON MONDAY, BUT THE PATTERN OF 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WITH EMBEDDED WAVES STILL HOLDS, SO LEFT IN A LOW 
CHANCE OF POPS THAT DAY, TOO.

MAX TEMPS APPEARED A BIT LOW IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW PATTERN. ANY 
FRONTS WILL BE RATHER MILD, SO HAVE UPPED MAX TEMPS A FEW DEGREES 
AND LARGELY LEFT MINS ALONE.

CHANCE RANGE (40ISH) MOST PLACES. THERE ARE GAPS IN THE TRAIN OF 
SHORT WAVES WHICH WILL DETERMINE WHEN THE RAIN FALLS, BUT THESE GAPS 
ARE ON THE ORDER OF A FEW HOURS AND TOO FINE DETAIL TO ACCURATLY 
FORECAST. HENCE, A BIT OF A BROAD BRUSH IN THE POPS AND CLOUD COVER 
THU-SUN.  SOME SIGNS OF DRYING AGAIN ON MONDAY, BUT THE PATTERN OF 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WITH EMBEDDED WAVES STILL HOLDS, SO LEFT IN A LOW 
CHANCE OF POPS THAT DAY, TOO.

MAX TEMPS APPEARED A BIT LOW IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW PATTERN. ANY 
FRONTS WILL BE RATHER MILD, SO HAVE UPPED MAX TEMPS A FEW DEGREES 
AND LARGELY LEFT MINS ALONE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE OVER THE REGION IN THE SHORT TERM.  AN LEVEL UPPER TROUGH 
WILL APPROACH BUT WILL HAVE LIMITED MOISTURE TO WORK WITH...AND 
SHOULD BRING LITTLE MORE THAN SOME HIGH CLOUDS TO THE AREA.  MAV 
TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.    

.LONG TERM (CHRISTMAS THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHORTWAVE TREKS EAST ACROSS 
THE DEEP SOUTH ON CHRISTMAS WITH LITTLE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING IN BEHIND THIS SYSTEM. FORECAST STAYS DRY OR IS 
NOT THREATENED WITH PRECIP UNTIL WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN A SHORTWAVE 
SWINGS NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY WITH AN ASSOCIATED WEAK FROPA. 
USED SLIGHT CHANCE POP AND USED IT ONLY DURING THIS PERIOD. PULLED 
THE POPS AGAIN THROUGH MUCH OF THURSDAY AWAITING STRENGTHENING WARM 
AIR AND MOISTURE ADVECTION AHEAD OF NEXT WAVE AND SURFACE LOW WHICH 
DRAGS ANOTHER FRONT INTO THE NEIGHBORHOOD. THIS FRONT DOESNT GET 
VERY FAR SOUTH AND EAST FROM THE FORECAST AREA AS HIGH PRESSURE 
HOLDS ITS OWN JUST OFF THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. COAST. MAINTAINED 
MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE POPS FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY AS SEVERAL WAVES OF 
LOW PRESSURE RIDE ALONG STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY. FRONT FINALLY GETS 
A DECENT PUSH OFF THE COAST BY SUNDAY NIGHT. WITH AIR ORIGINATING 
FROM THE PACIFIC MOST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL DURING THE LONG TERM.

317 PM EST SUN DEC 23 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...COLD FRONT TRACKING EAST OF THE 
CWA...WITH DECREASING CLOUDS EXPECTED. STILL SOME STRONG 
GUSTY WINDS ACROSS OUR NORTHERN ZONES AND THE MOUNTAINS BEING 
REPORTED.  WINDS SHOULD DIMINISH A BIT TONIGHT AS THE GRADIENT 
RELAXES...BUT SHOULD STILL HAVE BREEZY CONDITIONS IN THE NORTH 
TONIGHT.  WINDS SHOULD WEAKEN MORE ON MONDAY. HIGH PRESSURE PUSHING 
IN BEHIND THE FRONT BRINGING COLD AND DRY WEATHER TONIGHT.  HIGH 
PRESSURE LINGERS ACROSS THE AREA ON MONDAY BRINGING MORE DRY WEATHER 
UNDER A MOSTLY SUNNY SKY.  STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR 
TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE AT THE 
SURFACE WILL GIVE WAY TO WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH PROGGED TO MOVE 
THROUGH THE SOUTHEAST CHRISTMAS OR CHRISTMAS NIGHT. GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS CLOSE OFF AN UPPER LOW OVER AL/MS CHRISTMAS MORNING BUT NO 
SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE GETS WRAPPED UP INTO IT UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT SE 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. TOOK OUT PRECIPITATION EXCEPT EASTERN TN AND 
SW NC MOUNTAINS. OTHERWISE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
WITH RIDGING ALOFT WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF NEXT TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER 
THE CENTRAL US. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD DURING THE DAY UPPER 40S 
AND 50S WITH COLD NIGHTS IN THE 20S TO LOWER 30S MONDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST FOLLOWED CLOSE TO 
ECMWF WHICH IS WETTER THAN GFS AS IT DEVELOPS TROUGH TO THE WEST BY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WHICH BRINGS MOISTURE IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN. GFS MOVES THIS FIRST SYSTEM 
TO THE NORTH OF THE OHIO RIVER KEEPING HIGHER PRESSURE IN CONTROL 
ANOTHER DAY. BOTH MODELS SIMILAR AFTER THAT WITH BROAD WESTERN 
TROUGH AND A STRONGER SYSTEM MOVING INTO THE MS VALLEY FRIDAY. WARM 
FRONT AHEAD OF IT SHOULD INCREASE RAIN CHANCES THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
FRIDAY THEN LOWER PRESSURE MOVING UP ALONG FRONT AND UPPER RIDGE 
OVER CUBA KEEPS FRONT MOVING SLOWLY EAST THROUGH SUNDAY. GOOD CHANCE 
OF RAIN FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES LOOK WARM ENOUGH FOR 
ALMOST ALL RAIN EXCEPT LATE NIGHT AND EARLY MORNING HOURS THURSDAY 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL TN MOUNTAINS.

SOUTHEASTERN U.S. ON MONDAY WHILE SHORTWAVE MOVES QUICKLY EAST 
TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY DURING THE DAY. THIS TROF MOVES ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA LATE CHRISTMAS EVE THROUGH ABOUT MID DAY ON 
CHRISTMAS. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE MOISTURE STARVED WITH HIGHER PRESSURE 
LIMITING ANY LOW LEVEL RETURN FROM THE GULF. ALMOST HAS THE 
APPEARANCE OF SOMETHING THAT MAY NEED TO BE REMOVED FROM THE 
FORECAST ENTIRELY WITH MODEL SOLUTIONS INDICATING LOWER PROBABILITY 
OF PRECIP WITH EACH RUN. HOWEVER WANTED TO MAINTAIN SOME CONTINUITY 
FOR NOW AND WITH OVERNIGHT/EARLY MORNING TIMING SPRINKLED IN SNOW 
FLURRIES AS LOW LEVEL AIRMASS WILL REMAIN JUST COLD ENOUGH PRIOR TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR PRECIP GENERATION. AT ANY RATE WHATEVER PRECIP OR 
CLOUDS WERE ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROF WILL BE PRETTY MUCH GONE BY MID 
TO LATE AFTERNOON ON CHRISTMAS TO BE FOLLOWED BY MORE EXCELLENT 
BENIGN WEATHER WHICH CONTINUES THROUGH ABOUT MID DAY WEDNESDAY. 
ACTIVE PATTERN BRINGS YET ANOTHER WEAK WAVE TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA 
LATER WEDNESDAY INTO THE EVENING HOURS AND HAD TO APPLY A SLIGHT

STORM SYSTEM. USED GRADUALLY INCREASING POPS THROUGH SATURDAY

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
400 AM EST SAT DEC 22 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TO LIFT 
NORTHEAST OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION...WITH A COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO OUR AREA BY LATE TONIGHT.  
STRONG SOUTHEAST WINDS AHEAD OF THIS FRONT WILL LEAD TO DOWNSLOPE 
DRYING AND WARMING FOR THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS TODAY 
INTO TONIGHT. STRONG GUSTY WINDS CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED IN THE 
MOUNTAINS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT.  A WIND 
ADVISORY OR HIGH WIND WARNING WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED FOR HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS BY TONIGHT...WILL ADD MENTION OF STRONG WINDS IN HWO.  
WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR 
TODAY...BUT MAIN PRECIP WILL BE TONIGHT.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS 
NORTHEAST VALLEY...WITH CATEGORICAL SOUTHWEST ZONES FOR LATE 
TONIGHT. SOME THUNDER MAY OCCUR...BUT INSTABILITY LOOKS UNIMPRESSIVE 
SO WILL KEEP MENTION OUT FOR NOW.  WILL GENERALLY GO ABOVE MAV TEMPS 
FOR DOWNSLOPE AREAS BOTH TODAY AND TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED FRONT 
BLAST THROUGH MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE MORNING FOLLOWED 
BY DRYING. SURFACE RIDGE EXTENDS ACROSS THE REGION ON MONDAY 
WITH DRY SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AS ANOTHER SHORTWAVE DEVELOPS IN 
ACTIVE SOUTHERN STREAM ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. SURFACE LOW WILL 
SHIFT EAST NEAR THE GULF WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT CREATING THE 
POSSIBILITY FOR PRECIP LATER CHRISTMAS EVE INTO CHRISTMAS. THERE 
COULD BE A FEW SNOWFLAKES WITH THE COLDER AIR IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM AT LEAST UNTIL MID DAY WHEN WARMING LEAVES PRECIP IN THE FORM 
OF RAIN. THIS WAVE EXITS BY THE EVENING ON CHRISTMAS ALLOWING FOR A 
BRIEF DRY PERIOD WHICH EXTENDS THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING. HOWEVER 
NEXT WAVE APPROACHES THROUGH THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH 
INCREASING CHANCES FOR RAIN LATER WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON INTO THE 
EVENING. MAINTAINED CHANCE FOR RAIN ON THURSDAY WITH PROBABILITIES 
DROPPING DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS AS SHORTWAVE EXITS. WENT MUCH 
CLOSER TO ECMWF DEPICTION FOR FRIDAY WITH ANOTHER SYSTEM BUILDING 
INTO THE EASTERN U.S. WITH INCREASING CHANCES FOR RAIN FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS. USED A BROAD BRUSH APPROACH WITH 
POPS DURING THIS LATE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST AND DUE TO PRECIP 
FALLING INTO COLDER AIR AT NIGHT...SPRINKLED SOME SNOW BACK IN 
ACROSS MAINLY NORTHERN PARTS OF THE REGION. THERE WILL CERTAINLY BE 
CHANGES MADE TO THIS ACTIVE LONG TERM FORECAST IN THE COMING DAYS AS 
SHORT WAVE TIMING AND STRENGTH OF TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE ADVECTION 
WITH EACH SYSTEM COME INTO BETTER FOCUS.

.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS EVENING.  CLOUDS REMAIN ACROSS 
MOST OF THE CWA.  TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST APPEAR ON 
TRACK.  NO CHANGES NEEDED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
DOWNSLOPE WINDS HAVE ERODED CLOUDS ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SW VA. HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL REMAIN 
ENTRENCHED EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS...KEEPING A E-SE FLOW IN PLACE 
ALOFT. THIS WILL RESULT IN CONTINUED CLOUDS IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY 
AS THE LOW LEVEL WIND TRAJECTORY IN THAT AREA IS FROM THE ATLANTIC. 
WITH CLEARING IN THE NORTH AND CENTRAL SECTIONS AND A MOIST GROUND 
FROM LAST NIGHTS RAINFALL...FOG WILL BE A POSSIBILITY...THOUGH IT 
MAY BE OFFSET BY THE DOWNSLOPE FLOW. WILL NOT MENTION FOG AT THIS 
TIME IN THE ZONES. 

A STRENGTHENING 850 MB FLOW WILL BRING HIGHER THETA-E AIR TO THE 
AREA TOMORROW. EXPECT OVERCAST SKIES IN THE SOUTH...AND BROKEN 
CLOUDS NORTH. THE LLJ INCREASES OVERNIGHT...UP TO AROUND 60 KTS IN 
THE GFS AND NAM...AND HIGH WINDS COULD BE A PROBLEM IN THE MOUNTAINS 
SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING. CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH YET TO 
PUT OUT A HIGH WIND WATCH...BUT LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED AT LEAST AN 
ADVISORY. DEEP LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE 
FRONT ENTERS THE AREA AROUND 06Z. STRONG DOWNSLOPE WINDS MAY INHIBIT 
PRECIP MOVEMENT INTO NE TN/SW VA...BUT BY 12Z THE ENTIRE AREA WILL 
SEE PRECIP. WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS AFTER 06Z SOUTH AND 
WEST...AND AFTER 12Z NORTH AND EAST. POPS END QUICKLY BEHIND THE 
FRONT...WHICH WILL BE TO OUR EAST BY THE AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES MAY 
BE FALLING DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY AS COLD ADVECTION KICKS IN 
BEHIND THE FRONT.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...PROGRESSIVE PATTERN 
CONTINUES SUNDAY NIGHT WITH MODELS LIFTING SYSTEM TO THE NE AT 00Z 
MONDAY SURFACE LOW IS OVER LAKE SUPERIOR AND UPPER CENTER TO THE SE 
NEAR LAKE HURON. EXPECT PRECIPITATION TO BE OVER AND COLDER DRIER 
AIR WITH TROUGH MOVING IN. HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE SOUTH CENTRAL 
GULF COAST WILL BRING FAIR WEATHER TO THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 
MONDAY. MONDAY NIGHT A WEAK TROUGH DEVELOPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS AND LOWER MS VALLEY AHEAD OF DEEPER TROUGH OVER THE ROCKIES 
AND NORTHWEST. MOISTURE WILL SPREAD RAPIDLY BACK INTO THE AREA AND 
WITH COLDER AIR IN PLACE BRING SOME SNOW EARLY TUESDAY BEFORE THE 
ATMOSPHERE WARMS. AT THIS TIME DO NOT THINK THERE WILL BE ANY 
ACCUMULATION IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS BEFORE THE SNOW CHANGES TO 
RAIN. HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY SEE SLIGHT ACCUMULATIONS BUT EVEN THERE 
THE WARMER AIR ALOFT SHOULD MOVE IN FAIRLY QUICKLY TUESDAY. TUESDAY 
NIGHT THIS SYSTEM MOVES OUT AS DEEP TROUGH MOVES INTO THE PLAINS 
STATES THIS NEXT SYSTEM COULD PRODUCE MORE SIGNIFICANT RAIN 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WITH A BRIEF BREAK BEFORE THE TROUGH 
IN THE CENTRAL STATES SENDS ANOTHER SYSTEM INTO THE TN VALLEY 
FRIDAY. THE FRIDAY SYSTEM WILL BRING ENOUGH COLDER AIR FOR A CHANCE 
OF SNOW AT LEAST AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS NORTH AND 
MOUNTAINS.

.DISCUSSION...
MOST OF THE RAIN HAS EXITED THE ARE WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM. HOWEVER A FEW SHOWERS REMAIN ALONG THE MOUNTAIN
RIDGES AS A STRONG SURFACE HIGH OVER NEW ENGLAND PRODUCES A MOIST
SOUTHEAST UPSLOPE FLOW. PRECIP AMOUNTS SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT IN OUR
AREA...AND WILL ADD ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP TO THE NE TN MOUNTAINS
AND THE SMOKIES TODAY. DOWNSLOPE EFFECTS ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE
MOUNTAINS SHOULD PROVIDE SOME PARTIAL CLEARING OF CLOUDS IN THE TN
VALLEY AND SW VA. HOWEVER WITH LITTLE DRY AIR ADVECTION TO ASSIST
CLOUD EROSION...EXPECT CLOUDS TO HANG IN LONGER THAN THE MODELS
INDICATE. WILL INCREASE CLOUD COVER GRIDS A BIT. TEMPERATURES ARE
RUNNING CLOSE TO FORECAST AND WILL NOT BE CHANGED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL PULL OUT 
QUICKLY THIS MORNING...FOLLOWED BY UPPER LEVEL RIDGING.  SURFACE 
HIGH TO THE NORTHEAST WILL BUILD IN.  DEEP MOISTURE WILL EXIT 
QUICKLY. WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS NORTHEAST AND SLIGHT CHANCE CENTRAL 
THIS MORNING...THEN DRY.  APPEARS SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL 
LINGER...ALTHOUGH LOW LEVEL WINDS SHOULD BE PRIMARILY SOUTHEAST SO 
MAY SEE DOWNSLOPE FLOW HELP TO DIMINISH CLOUDS WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS 
BY THIS AFTERNOON.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY A  
FEW MINOR TWEAKS. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...QUITE AN ACTIVE PERIOD 
HEADING TOWARD THE END OF 2007 WITH THE SOUTHERN STREAM BRINGING 
THREE SHORTWAVE FEATURES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE FIRST FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY HAS A STRONG FRONTAL SYSTEM WITH FROPA 
AROUND DAYBREAK SUNDAY WITH SOME POST FRONTAL PRECIP. NEXT WAVE 
CENTERED AROUND TUESDAY WITH GFS A LITTLE STRONGER THAN ECMWF WITH 
LIFT AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP. LEANED A CLOSER TO THE GFS USING SMALL 
CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE WITH SYSTEM EXITING MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
BY TUESDAY NIGHT. NEXT WAVE APPROACHES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
ON WEDNESDAY AND ALLOWED FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AS WAA STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF DEEPENING TROF. BEST SHOT AT 
RAIN WITH THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY 
AND USED SMALL AND MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR THIS EXTENDED PERIOD OF 
THE FORECAST. HAD TO MENTION POSSIBILITY OF MAINLY HIGHER ELEVATION 
SNOW MONDAY NIGHT...WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT WITH LOW 
LEVEL AIRMASS COOLING TO AROUND FREEZING AND JUST BELOW IN THESE 
AREAS. OF COURSE AS MODEL SOLUTIONS WITH SOME OF THESE SHORTWAVES 
COME INTO BETTER FOCUS WE WILL HAVE A BETTER IDEA CONCERNING THE

EXPECT ELEVATED INSTABILITY TO BE ADEQUATE TO SUPPORT
THUNDERSTORMS. CONVECTION ALONG THE GULF COAST MAY ALSO SERVE TO

422 AM EST THU DEC 20 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SURFACE OBSERVATIONS IN THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY INDICATING VISIBILITIES NEAR ZERO ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY FROM THE RECENT RAIN.  WILL ISSUE A 
DENSE FOG ADVISORY FOR THOSE AREAS.  THE SOUTHERN AREAS OF THE CWA 
SHOULD ONLY SEE PATCHY FOG...SO WILL NOT INCLUDE THOSE AREAS IN THE 
ADVISORY.  MODELS TRACK A SHORTWAVE AND SURFACE LOW FROM THE WEST 
INTO THE REGION LATE TODAY.  SHOULD HAVE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE WITH TO 
KEEP LIKELY POPS IN THE WEST FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND DRY IN THE 
NORTHERN AREAS.  BEST CHANCES SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL TONIGHT AS THE 
DISTURBANCE TRACKS THROUGH THE CWA.  MODELS INDICATING GOOD LIFT AND 
DEEP MOISTURE WITH IT...WILL KEEP 80 POPS FOR TONIGHT.  THICKNESSES 
INDICATE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE ALL LIQUID.  UPPER LOW SHIFTS TO  
THE EAST ON FRIDAY.  WILL CARRY LOW POPS FOR ONLY FRIDAY MORNING... 
WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN OUR EASTERN ZONES.  STAYED NEAR MOS 
GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL EVOLUTION OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY...BUT HAVE SOME TIMING 
DIFFERENCES AS THE WRF MODEL REVEALS A FASTER EASTWARD PROGRESSION 
OF THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT (COMPARED TO THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS). 
WITH A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH PROGGED...WILL TREND 
TOWARD THE SLOWER GFS/ECMWF SOLUTION WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECTED 
AROUND 12Z SUNDAY MORNING. THESE THREE MODELS TEND TO AGREE THAT 
COLDER SUB-FREEZING AIR WILL NOT ARRIVE ON SUNDAY BEFORE MOISTURE 
EXITS THE REGION. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT THERE WILL NOT BE MUCH (IF 
ANY) SNOWFALL WITH THIS SYSTEM. 

BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS INDICATE A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM QUICKLY MOVING INTO 
THE REGION BY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. A MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK TO 
THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO FAVOR A COLDER AIR MASS FOR THE FORECAST AREA 
AND THE POSSIBILITY OF SNOW. SINCE BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE 
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM AND BOTH HAVE SHOWN SHOWN SOME 
CONSISTENCY (THE LAST FEW MODEL RUNS) OF THE POSSIBILITY OF 
WIDESPREAD SNOWFALL...WILL GO AHEAD AND MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SNOW FOR CHRISTMAS (MAINLY DURING THE MORNING HOURS). IT REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN IF TEMPS CAN REMAIN COLD ENOUGH FOR MUCH ACCUMULATIONS... 
SINCE RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT TEMPS WILL RISE ABOVE FREEZING IN 
THE VALLEYS...LIMITING THE AMOUNT OF POSSIBLE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
FOR THE VALLEYS. YET ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM QUICKLY MOVES INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...SO WILL MENTION A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR PRECIP ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. RIGHT NOW...IT APPEARS 
THAT TEMPS MAY BE A LITTLE WARMER WITH THIS SYSTEM.

935 PM EST WED DEC 19 2007

.DISCUSSION...MINOR UPDATE TO FORECAST. NE TN VALLEY LOCATIONS HAVE 
SUNK TO THE FCST LOW. WILL LOWER MINS THOSE AREAS A COUPLE DEGREES 
BUT DONT EXPECT TEMPS TO FALL MUCH MORE. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
ADVECTION UNDERWAY FM SW AND EXPECT CLOUD COVER TO INCREASE 
OVERNIGHT. UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR EVENING SKIES TEMPS HAVE COOLED TO 
NEAR SATURATION AND WILL INCLUDE PATCHY FOG ALL AREAS. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT TROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...MUCH OF THE LOW CLOUDS 
THAT COVERED THE AREA THIS MORNING HAVE DISSIPATED AS DRY AIR ALOFT 
HAS MOVED EAST. HOWEVER PLENTY OF CLOUDS REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE AREA AND IN NRN AL/GA...IN THE VICINITY OF A 850 
THETA-E GRADIENT. MEANWHILE A TROUGH OVER THE SW CONUS WILL MOVE 
EAST AND INDUCE CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. AN INCREASING 
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL PUSH THE HIGHER THETA-E AIR NORTHWARD LATE 
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING...BRINGING A RETURN OF LOW CLOUDS. LIFT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE 500 MB VORT MAX AND UPPER DIFFLUENCE WILL 
PROVIDE LIFT LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON FOR PRECIP. EXPECT THE PRECIP 
TO BEGIN IN THE SOUTH FIRST...PROBABLY AROUND NOON...THEN SPREAD 
NORTHWARD. MOUNTAIN SHADOWING MAY DELAY ONSET OF PRECIP IN THE NORTH 
UNTIL AROUND 00Z FRIDAY. THE LIFT AND DEEPEST MOISTURE APPEAR 
MAXIMIZED IN BOTH THE GFS AND NAM AFTER 00Z...AND WILL HAVE 
CATEGORICAL POPS OVERNIGHT. THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS WILL 
BE JUST EAST OF OUR AREA AT 12Z...AND POPS WILL TAPER OFF IN THE 
EARLY MORNING HOURS. FOR TEMPERATURES...LEANED TOWARD THE WARMER 
LOWS TONIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT AND THE COOLER HIGHS DUE TO EXPECTED 
CLOUD COVER AND RECENT MODEL WARM BIAS FOR HIGHS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS WILL LINGER 
OVER THE AREA FRIDAY MORNING AS THE THRUSDAY/S SYSTEM EXITS THE 
REGION.  WILL BRIEFLY BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH AT 
LEAST SATURDAY MORNING.  MODEL AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY VERY POOR 
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED THOUGH GFS SEEMS TO BE TRENDING 
SLOWER WITH SYSTEMS.  CURRENT RUN BRINGS THE NEXT SYSTEM INTO THE 
MRX CWA LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  HAVE THEREFORE... KEPT 
JUST LOW POPS FOR LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND LOWERED POPS SLIGHT 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND INCREASE POPS A BIT FOR EARLY SUNDAY.  
ADDITIONALLY...THE OPERATIONAL GFS PULLS IN ANOTHER WEATHER SYSTEM 
AROUND THE MONDAY/ MONDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME...THIS IS NOT CONSISTENT 
WITH MANY OF THE OTHER MODELS AND CONFIDENCE IS VERY LOW WITH THIS 
FEATURE.  FOR NOW...HAVE ADDED LOW POPS TO MONDAY NIGHT...LEAVING 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY DRY.  HAVE ALSO LEFT THE REST OF THE PERIOD DRY 
THOUGH MODELS HINTING AT ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHING THE REGION 
AROUND WEDNESDAY.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1007 AM EST WED DEC 19 2007

.DISCUSSION...
PRECIP THAT MOVED THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING WAS ASSOCIATED WITH
500 MB VORTICITY ADVECTION AND DIFFLUENCE AHEAD OF THE UPPER JET.
WITH THE PASSAGE OF THESE FEATURES TO OUR EAST...PRECIP HAS ENDED
IN OUR AREA. 12Z OHX RAOB SHOWS DRY AIR ABOVE 800 MB...WITH A MOIST
LAYER BELOW. SATELLITE TRENDS SHOW BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS OVER MIDDLE
TN. SO EXPECT MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS THE AREA UNTIL LATE IN THE
AFTERNOON. UPDATE WILL REMOVE POPS AND TWEAK TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY.

324 AM EST WED DEC 19 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR INDICATING ISOLATED AREAS OF 
VERY LIGHT RAIN TRACKING THROUGH THE CWA ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK COLD 
FRONT AND SHORTWAVE.  MODELS AGREE ON TRACKING THE FRONT THROUGH THE 
REGION QUICKLY TODAY WITH DRY WEATHER RETURNING TONIGHT.  
TEMPERATURES HAVE BEEN RISING AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO FREEZING RAIN 
AND SLEET HAVE NOT BEEN REPORTED YET.  BUT MAY STILL SEE A BRIEF 
WINTRY MIX EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS SHOULD BE 
VERY LIGHT.  HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN LATER TODAY BRINGING DRY 
WEATHER FOR TONIGHT.  STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE BLEND NUMBERS FOR 
TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LONG-RANGE MODELS ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH AN OVERALL SLOWER PROGRESSION OF THE NEXT 
SEVERAL SYSTEMS THAT ARE PROGGED TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 
EARLY NEXT WEEK. ON THURSDAY...A SHORT-WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP A WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. AN INVERTED TROUGH TO THE NORTH OF 
THIS LOW SHOULD HELP TO TRIGGER SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA...MAINLY ON THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM WILL QUICKLY 
MOVE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...WITH A LONG-WAVE UPPER 
TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHWEST DEVELOPING ANOTHER STRONGER LOW PRESSURE 
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON FRIDAY NIGHT. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
WITH THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY PROGGED TO BRING SHOWERS 
TO THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY NIGHT... BUT WITH SUCH AN AMPLIFIED 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH...WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF LATER MODEL RUNS 
SLOW-DOWN THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS FRONT A LITTLE MORE. 
TEMPS WILL QUICKLY WARM AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...WITH NOT MUCH COLD AIR 
EXPECTED BEHIND IT. THUS...DONT EXPECT MUCH OF A CHANCE FOR SNOW ON 
SUNDAY MORNING...AS MOISTURE QUICKLY EXITS THE REGION BEHIND THE 
FRONT. ECMWF AND GFS MODELS REVEAL SOME LARGE DISCREPANCIES FOR 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...SO WILL NOT CHANGE PREVIOUS FORECAST VERY MUCH FOR 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...RELATIVELY LOW AMPLITUDE 
SHORT WAVE PRESSING EAST TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON. NICE AREA OF STRATUS ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE ACROSS THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE REGION. ALWAYS DIFFICULT TO 
DETERMINE HOW MUCH WARMING WILL OCCUR IN ADVANCE OF A WEAK WINTER 
SYSTEM. WENT AHEAD AND USED MINS TEMPS AT FREEZING OR BELOW MAINLY 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS WELL AS HIGHER TERRAIN 
AREAS. WEAK LIFT AND MOISTURE NOT VERY DEEP SO STAYED WITH SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS. SPRINKLED IN A BIT OF LIGHT RAIN AND A FEW SLEET 
PELLETS LOWER ELEVATIONS AND THEN A MIXTURE OF LIGHT SLEET/SNOW/RAIN 
HIGHER TERRAIN FOR THE WEAK SYSTEM WHICH RIPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY LATE MORNING. NEXT SYSTEM BRINGS ANOTHER SHOT AT 
RAIN ON THURSDAY BUT NOT UNTIL LATER IN THE AFTERNOON AND MAINLY 
AFFECTING THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA BEFORE SUNSET. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FORECAST TIMING LEANS 
TOWARD ECMWF WHICH CARVES A SHARPER AND DEEP TROUGH WEST OF THE AREA 
THIS WEEKEND. MAIN RESULT OF THIS SOLUTION IS SLOWER PROGRESSION AND 
A NOTABLY WARMER SATURDAY. 

SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH THU NGT BRINGING CLOUDS AND A GOOD CHANCE 
OF PCPN WITH ITS PASSING. TEMPS WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL. RIDGING FROM 
THE NE MAINTAINS FRI AND SAT AS DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
DEVELOPS TO THE W. STRONG LOW MOVES NE THROUGH GRTLKS ON SUN WITH 
COLD FRONT MOVING EAST THROUGH S APPALACHIANS EARLY SUN. BEST PCPN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...WITH A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE UPPER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MOVING THIS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM QUICKLY ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION TODAY...WITH 
ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVING TOWARDS THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY LATE 
TONIGHT. MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE LIMITED AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT... 
BUT BOTH THE GFS AND WRF MODELS INDICATE THAT IT WILL BE ENOUGH FOR 
SOME DEVELOPMENT OF PATCHY LIGHT PRECIP LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY 
WEDNESDAY. OF CONCERN IS THE FACT THAT TEMPS WILL BE HOVERING AROUND 
FREEZING AS THIS LIGHT PRECIP BEGINS TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA. 
HOWEVER...BOTH MODELS INDICATE THAT SOUTHERLY WINDS AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT WILL PUSH TEMPS ABOVE FREEZING AS THE LIGHT PRECIP MOVES INTO 
THE AREA. ALTHOUGH SOME EVAPORATIVE COOLING SHOULD OCCUR DUE TO THE 
DRY BOUNDARY LAYER...MODELS INDICATE THAT SURFACE WET-BULB TEMPS 
WILL RISE ABOVE FREEZING MOST EVERYWHERE...EXCEPT ACROSS NORTHEAST 
TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. HOWEVER...EXPECT PRECIP TO REMAIN WEST OF THESE 
AREAS UNTIL AFTER SUNRISE ON WEDNESDAY MORNING. THUS...WILL ONLY 
MENTION RAIN AS THE PRECIP TYPE FOR LATE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THROUGH THE PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING 
INTO THE AREA EARLY IN THE PERIOD BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. A SHORTWAVE IS EXPECTED TO PUSH INTO THE REGION LATE ON 
THURSDAY. MODELS AGREE ON KEEPING THE BEST MOISTURE TO THE WEST AND 
SOUTH OF OUR CWA ON THURSDAY...SO WILL LOWER POPS ON THURSDAY WITH 
THE BEST POPS IN THE SOUTH. MOISTURE INCREASES ON THURSDAY NIGHT AS 
THE SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT. SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL LIQUID PRECIPITATION 
ON THURSDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN ON FRIDAY BRINGING DRY 
WEATHER ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. A FRONT PUSHES INTO THE AREA ON 
LATE SATURDAY ALONG WITH INCREASING MOISTURE. WILL KEEP 20-30 POPS 
FOR SATURDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN OUR WESTERN ZONES. FRONT 
PASSES THROUGH ON SATURDAY NIGHT ALONG WITH DEEPER MOISTURE...WILL 
KEEP 40 POPS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT. SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL 
LIQUID PRECIPITATION ON SATURDAY NIGHT AS WELL. COLDER AIR PUSHES IN 
ON SUNDAY AS THE DEEPEST MOISTURE EXITS THE CWA...WILL KEEP LOW POPS 
FOR SUNDAY. UPPER LOW FOLLOWS TO THE NORTH ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY. BEST MOISTURE REMAINS TO THE NORTH...BUT WILL KEEP LOW POPS 
FOR OUR NORTHERN ZONES AND THE MOUNTAINS. SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR 
SNOW FOR BOTH PERIODS...BUT MOISTURE TOO LIMITED FOR SIGNIFICANT 
ACCUMULATIONS. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...DEEPENING SURFACE LOW HAS NOW MOVED TO THE MAINE COAST 
WITH UPPER SYSTEM OVER NEW YORK. PRESSURE GRADIENT IS STILL TIGHT 
AND PRODUCING NW WINDS OF 15 TO 20 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 30 MPH ACROSS 
NE TN AND SW VA THIS EVENING. AREA VAD WIND PROFILES SHOW 
NORTHWESTERLY WINDS STILL IN THE 25 TO 35 MPH RANGE ABOVE THE 
SURFACE. SNOW FLURRIES ARE STILL OCCURRING IN THE NORTHERN VALLEY 
AND POSSIBLY HEAVIER IN THE MOUNTAINS. CLOUDS HAVE DEPARTED THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY BUT ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY NE. CLOUD COVER 
SHOULD BE SLOW TO ERODE OVER SW VA AND NE TN AREAS...AS UPPER FLOW 
CONTINUES FROM THE GREAT LAKES TOWARDS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. 
TEMPERATURES ARE VERY CLOSE TO CURRENT HOURLY GRIDS SO WILL KEEP 
CURRENT LOWS. UPDATE WILL REDUCE CLOUD COVER SOUTH AND KEEP FLURRIES 
SLIGHT CHANCE SNOW IN MOUNTAINS SW VA AND NE TN A FEW MORE HOURS.

310 PM EST SUN DEC 16 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM LIFTING NE 
AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON...AND AREA VAD 
WIND PROFILES SHOW WESTERLY WINDS DECREASING INTO THE 25 TO 35 MPH 
RANGE. SURFACE OBSERVATIONS INDICATE GUSTS FALLING BELOW 40 MPH AS 
WELL. THUS...CANCELED THE WIND ADVISORIES BEFORE 3PM EST.

LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW NEVER QUITE MAXIMIZED THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
INSTABILITY OF 50 TO 100 J/KG THIS MORNING HAS GIVEN WAY TO STABLE 
CONDITIONS. SO FAR...A COUPLE REPORTS OF A DUSTING OF SNOW COVER
...GENERALLY OUTSIDE OF ADVISORY AREA. BASED ON AREA RADARS AND 
LACK OF UPSLOPE...ALSO CANCELED THE SNOW ADVISORY BEFORE 3PM EST.

CLOUD COVER MAY BE SLOW TO ERODE OVER SWRN VA AND NE TN AREAS...
WHILE ELSEWHERE SKIES SHOULD GRADUALLY CLEAR OVERNIGHT. WENT CLOSER 
TO COLDER GFS MOS MINS EXCEPT FOR TRI WHERE WINDS AND CLOUDS ARE A 
FACTOR. FOR MONDAY...SHOULD SEE AMPLE SUNSHINE BUT 850 MBS REMAIN 
COLD AND SURFACE FLOW NORTHERLY...SO I BLENDED BETWEEN GFS AND 
NAM-WRF MOS MAX TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LOOKS LIKE A 
PROGRESSIVE PATTERN IN THE LONG TERM...AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
AREA MONDAY NIGHT GIVES WAY TO THE NEXT SYSTEM BY THURSDAY...AND 
THEN ANOTHER SYSTEM FOR THE WEEKEND.  WILL KEEP THINGS DRY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...ALTHOUGH MODELS HINTING THAT THERE MAY BE ENOUGH 
ISENTROPIC LIFT A CLOUDY DAY WITH SPRINKLES OR A LITTLE LIGHT RAIN.  
SINCE WE HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING MOSTLY SUNNY...WILL JUST BEEF UP THE 
CLOUDS CONSIDERABLY FOR NOW AND ALLOW LATER SHIFTS TO ADD PRECIP IF 
THAT STILL LOOKS PROBABLE.  WILL CARRY HIGHEST POPS 
THURSDAY...TAPERING TO SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH AND MOUNTAINS FRIDAY 
MORNING.  SHOULD BE PRIMARILY A LIQUID EVENT.  MORE UNCERTAINTY IN 
TIMING WEEKEND SYSTEM.  PLENTY OF SPREAD AMONG MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES...AND RUN TO RUN CONTINUITY NOT GREAT. FOR NOW WILL GO 
CLOSE TO THE 06Z GFS MODEL...AND BRING POPS IN SAT THROUGH SUNDAY.
GFS MOS TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY SOME MINOR
ADJUSTMENTS.

933 AM EST SUN DEC 16 2007

.DISCUSSION...VERY STRONG WESTERLY WINDS ACROSS THE FORECAST THIS 
MORNING...WITH SUSTAINED SPEEDS FROM 20 TO 35 MPH AND OCCASIONAL 
GUSTS AS HIGH AS 45 TO 55 MPH AT AND ABOVE 3000 FEET. VAD WIND 
PROFILERS FROM AREA NWS DOPPLER RADARS SHOW LOW LEVEL WINDS IN THE 
35 TO 45 MPH RANGE...WHICH IS A LITTLE BELOW THE NAM-WRF PREDICTION 
FOR THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON. THUS...WIND ADVISORIES FOR ENTIRE 
AREA LOOK ON TRACK.

WATER VAPOR SATELLITE PICS SHOW DRY SLOT PASSING ACROSS THE REGION
...LEAVING JUST VERY SHALLOW MOISTURE FOR COLD AIR ADVECTION AND 
SOME DEGREE OF UPSLOPE FLOW TO SQUEEZE OUT SOME LINGERING LIGHT 
WINTRY PRECIPITATION. 850 MB TEMPS HAVE TUMBLED PER UPPER AIR PLOTS 
THIS MORNING...DOWN TO -2 DEGS C IN NE CORNER OF TN TO -8 DEGS C 
ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. WHERE RADAR ECHOES PASS ACROSS WE ARE 
GETTING SPOTTY RAIN CHANGING TO OR MIXING WITH VERY LIGHT SLEET OR 
SNOW PELLETS. 

IF LOW LEVEL FLOW VEERS MORE TO NW DIRECTION THEN UPSLOPE WOULD BE 
ENHANCED...BUT STILL SUFFICENT TO POSSIBLY ALLOW SOME LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS IN THE SNOW ADVISORY AREAS THROUGH THIS AFTERNOON.
FORECAST IS IN GREAT SHAPE THIS MORNING...BUT WILL FRESHEN THE 
HOURLY CONDITIONS IN THE GRIDS AND ADJUST PRECIPITATION WORDING AS 
NEEDED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
317 AM EST SUN DEC 16 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER NORTHERN KENTUCKY...WITH AN OCCLUDED FRONT 
EXTENDING FROM IT SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT AREA 
RADARS REVEAL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF SHOWERS ALONG THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY...BUT ONLY VERY LIGHT AND SCATTERED ACTIVITY BEHIND IT. 
STRONG NORTHWESTERLY WINDS AND STEEP LOW-LEVEL LAPSE RATES SHOULD 
GENERATE SOME ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS LATER THIS 
MORNING...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WITH THIS SYSTEM SWINGS ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT TEMPS REMAIN WARM IN THE FORECAST AREA... 
WITH SUB-FREEZING AIR STILL WEST AND NORTHWEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI 
AND OHIO RIVERS. ALTHOUGH TEMPS WILL BE FALLING THROUGH THE DAY... 
VALLEY TEMPS WILL LIKELY REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING FOR MOST OF THE 
DAY...PREVENTING MUCH (IF ANY) SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. WARM GROUND TEMPS 
SHOULD ALSO PREVENT MUCH SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN THE VALLEYS. 
MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 850 MB TEMPS WILL 
QUICKLY DROP BELOW FREEZING AROUND SUNRISE...SO IT STILL APPEARS 
THAT ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
ABOVE 2500 FEET. IN ADDITION...A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION UP TO AN 
INCH APPEARS TO BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. 
UPSLOPE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW SHOULD ALSO HELP TO GENERATE MORE INTENSE 
SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH THIS EVENING. AS A 
RESULT...WILL PLAN TO REISSUE THE WIND AND SNOW ADVISORIES FOR 
TODAY. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...PROGRESSIVE AND SOMEWHAT 
UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. UPPER TROUGH WILL CONTINUE 
TO PULL AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY EARLY MONDAY AS 
WEAK UPPER RIDGING BUILDS IN. THIS WILL RESULT IN GENERALLY BENIGN 
WEATHER CONDITIONS FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY WITH SLOWLY MODERATING 
TEMPS. A WEAK UPPER WAVE WILL APPROACH ON WEDNESDAY...BUT ONLY THE 
GFS AND A FEW ENSEMBLE MEMBERS PROJECT ANY MEASURABLE PRECIP WITH 
IT. WILL LEAVE OUT POPS WITH THIS EVENT FOR NOW. MORE SIGNIFICANT 
SYSTEM APPROACHES ON THURSDAY. TIMING IS BIGGEST ISSUE WITH THIS 
EVENT WITH LATEST GFS RUN SOMEWHAT FASTER THAN ECMWF AND ENSEMBLE 
MEAN. WILL KEEP POPS IN CHANCE CATEGORY FOR BOTH LATE THURSDAY AND 
EARLY FRIDAY PENDING BETTER AGREEMENT BETWEEN MEDIUM RANGE MODELS 
AND ENSEMBLES. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES 
CLOSELY AS THEY SEEM REASONABLE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SYSTEM APPROACHING AND
GENERALLY AS EXPECTED. DID INCREASE POPS FOR LATE AFTERNOON AND
EARLY EVENING FOR SE TN AND SW NC...AS SHOWERS WORK NORTH FROM GA
AND SC. OTHERWISE MAIN AREA OF CONVECTION STILL SPREADING SLOWLY
EAST INTO MIDDLE TN...AND KEPT A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT
GIVEN LIFT AND SLIGHT INSTABILITY.

NO CHANGES FROM EARLIER THOUGHTS ON PRECIPITATION TYPE...WITH
MAINLY UPSLOPE AND COLD AIR ADVECTION GENERATING A LIGHT SNOWFALL
ON SUNDAY FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SWRN VA...NRN AND SMOKY
MOUNTAINS OF EAST TN. WENT AHEAD AND ISSUED A SNOW ADVISORY FOR
THOSE AREAS STARTING WITH THE MORNING PACKAGE ISSUANCE TIME...
AND MAINLY FOR ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET.

BASED ON STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT AND LOW LEVEL JET OVERNIGHT INTO
SUNDAY...EXPANDED AND EXTENDED THE WIND ADVISORY.

MOST WEB PRODUCTS AND ZFPMRX ALREADY ISSUED...NEED TO NOW FOCUS
ATTENTION ON GETTING THE NPW AND WSW PRODUCTS OUT TO THE PUBLIC.
THANKS TO SURROUNDING OFFICES FOR COORDINATION TODAY.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MORE OF A ZONAL FLOW 
DEVELOPS BEHIND WEEKEND STORM SYSTEM WHICH PROVIDES FOR DRY WEATHER 
ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. NEXT SYSTEM BUILDS EAST ACROSS THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WITH SURFACE LOW 
SHIFTING EAST FROM MISSOURI TO NORTHEAST OHIO BY 12Z FRIDAY. SOME 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GFS AND ECMWF BUT STAYED WITH MORE PROGRESSIVE 
GFS WHICH BRINGS A SHOT OF RAIN TO THE FORECAST AREA WITH MENTION OF 
A SNOW SHOWER OR TWO IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. TAPERED POP BACK TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE ON FRIDAY DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN RAPID DEPARTURE OF 
UPPER TROF. NEXT SHORT WAVE MAKES A MOVE TOWARD THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS LATER ON SATURDAY. BROAD BRUSHED A SMALL CHANCE POP FOR 
-SHRA AT THIS DISTANT PERIOD OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST.

954 AM EST SAT DEC 15 2007

.DISCUSSION...MAIN AREA OF SHOWERS IS STILL WELL TO OUR WEST THIS 
MORNING...AND IS PROGGD TO REACH AT LEAST WRN MOST PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY LATE AFTERNOON. MODELS ALSO SEEM INTENT ON 
DEVELOPING SHOWERS ACROSS ERN AREAS IN THE STRENGTHENING SE LOW 
LEVEL FLOW. HOWEVER...THIS SE FLOW WILL BE DOWNSLOPING FOR NRN AND 
CENTRAL VALLEY LOCATIONS...SO THIS WOULD INHIBIT ANY SHOWERS EXCEPT 
FOR CHEROKEE/CLAY COUNTIES OF NC AND HIGHEST PEAKS IN THE SMOKIES.
CURRENT FORECAST POP GRIDS REALLY REFLECT THIS SCENARIO QUITE WELL
...AND SHOULD NOT REQUIRE ANY CHANGES THIS MORNING.

OTHER ITEM OF CONCERN IS THE STRENGTHENING SE LOW LEVEL WINDS...
AND WE ARE ALREADY GETTING SPEEDS OF 15 TO 25 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS 
ABOVE 3000 FEET. WIND ADVISORY IN EFFECT LOOKS RIGHT ON TRACK.

850 MB ANALYSIS OF UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOWS STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION 
AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS ARE WARMER THAN VALLEY LOCATIONS. WILL UPDATE 
THE HOURLY GRIDS TO BETTER REFLECT THIS...AND ALSO MAKE SLIGHT 
ADJUSTMENTS TO THE MAX TEMP GRID FOR TODAY IF NEEDED.

FOR LATER PERIODS...GFS MODEL FINALLY CAME AROUND TO AGREE ON TRACK 
AND TIMING OF THE APPROACHING SYSTEM...AND REALLY DONT SEE MUCH IF 
ANY THREAT OF WINTRY PRECIPITATION THROUGH 12Z SUNDAY. THIS WOULD 
LEAVE THE POSSIBILITY FOR SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL IN THE MTNS ON SUNDAY
...AS ADVERTISED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
315 AM EST SAT DEC 15 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER TEXAS...WITH QUITE A BIT OF 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OCCURRING WITH IT ACROSS EAST TEXAS AND 
ARKANSAS. MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE 
EVOLUTION AND PROGRESSION OF THIS SYSTEM...AS AN AMPLIFIED UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS DEEPENS OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY BY 
THIS EVENING. AS A RESULT...THE SURFACE LOW WILL RAPIDLY STRENGTHEN 
OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON...AS IT CONTINUES 
MOVING NORTHEAST INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY THIS EVENING. STRONG 
SOUTHEASTERLY 850 MB WINDS ARE PROGGED TO DEVELOP LATER THIS MORNING 
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS...AND CONTINUE THROUGH TONIGHT. IN ADDITION TO 
THESE SOUTHEAST WINDS BECOMING PERPENDICULAR TO THE MOUNTAINS...A 
STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL EXTEND UP ABOVE THE RIDGES...THE REGION 
WILL BECOME LOCATED UNDER THE RIGHT-EXIT REGION OF A 250 MB JET 
STREAK...AND A FAIRLY STRONG 850 MB JET WILL DEVELOP TO OVER 
NORTHERN MIDDLE TN. THE COMBINATION OF THESE FACTORS SHOULD RESULT 
IN MOUNTAIN WAVE FORMATION WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF STRONG WINDS IN 
THE FOOTHILLS. THUS...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS...BUT WILL ALSO MENTION THAT STRONG GUSTY WINDS WILL ALSO 
BE POSSIBLE IN THE FOOTHILLS. WILL KEEP THIS ADVISORY IN EFFECT 
THROUGH TONIGHT SINCE 850 MB WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE FAIRLY STRONG 
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. STRONG WEST TO 
NORTHWEST WINDS WILL DEVELOP AREAWIDE BEHIND THE COLD FRONT ON 
SUNDAY...AND THIS ADVISORY MAY NEED TO BE EXPANDED FOR THE VALLEYS 
BY LATER SHIFTS. 

LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE TRENDING SLOWER WITH THIS SYSTEM AS THE UPPER 
TROUGH BECOMES HIGHLY AMPLIFIED AND NEGATIVELY-TILTED. AS A 
RESULT...IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE INITIAL RAIN WILL WAIT UNTIL 
THIS EVENING TO SPREAD OVER THE FORECAST AREA. STRONG SOUTHEASTERLY 
WINDS DOWNSLOPING OFF OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL ALSO HELP TO LIMIT THE 
AMOUNT OF RAINFALL THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...WILL LOWER POPS SOME FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON...BUT WILL KEEP HIGH POPS FOR THIS EVENING. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS REVEAL SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY THIS EVENING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA...SO WILL ADD A MENTION OF A FEW TSTORMS AREAWIDE. 
WILL ALSO TREND WARMER WITH MAXES THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
AND NORTHERN VALLEY ZONES...WHERE ADIABATIC WARMING SHOULD BE 
MAXIMIZED FROM THE SOUTHEASTERLY DOWNSLOPING WINDS. AS A RESULT OF 
THE SLOWER EVOLUTION OF THIS SYSTEM...MODELS INDICATE THAT RAIN WILL 
CHANGE TO SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATER (TOWARDS SUNRISE) 
ON SUNDAY...AS 850 MB TEMPS BEGIN TO FALL BELOW FREEZING. HOWEVER... 
TEMPS IN THE VALLEYS WILL LIKELY REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING UNTIL LATER 
IN THE DAY ON SUNDAY...PREVENTING MUCH (IF ANY) SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. 
WARM GROUND TEMPS SHOULD ALSO PREVENT MUCH SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN 
THE VALLEYS. OVERALL...IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE MOISTURE WILL 
QUICKLY EXIT THE REGION BY THE TIME THE RAIN CHANGES TO SNOW ON 
SUNDAY...BUT LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS STILL APPEAR TO BE POSSIBLE 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET. IN ADDITION...UPSLOPE 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL HELP KEEP SNOW SHOWERS LINGERING ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH SUNDAY EVENING. WILL PLAN TO REFRESH THE 
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT WITH THE LATEST FORECAST TENDS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STORM SYSTEM OVER WEEKEND MOVES 
ON TO THE EAST BY MONDAY A.M. AND LEAVES A ZONAL FLOW BEHIND. THIS 
FLOW WILL PREVENT ANY SUBSTANTIAL WARMING/COOLING THROUGH WEDNESDAY, 
BUT WILL ALSO PROVIDE A DRY AIRMASS FOR FAR FEWER CLOUDS. HAVE LEFT 
PREVIOUS FORECAST PACKAGE AS IS FOR MONDAY-WEDNESDAY.

BEGINNING THURSDAY, ANOTHER SHORT WAVE MOVES ACROSS OHIO-TENNESSEE 
VALLEYS FAIRLY QUICKLY. THIS SYSTEM LACKS SIGNIFICANT COLD AIR. 
EXPECT THAT SOME COOL ADVECTION WILL CREATE SOME FLURRIES TO LIGHT 
SNOW IN FAVORED UPSLOPE AND HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF THE MOUNTAINS, 
AND NORTHERN SECTION OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU, SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA, 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE ON THURSDAY MORNING, BUT NO ACCUMULATIONS. 
SLIGHT RIDGING IN WAKE OF TROF PASSAGE WILL ALLOW ENOUGH WARMING TO 
BRING TEMPS UP WELL INTO 40S AND 50S ALL AREAS TO CHANGE ANY PRECIP 
TO RAIN. STILL, AM NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING APPROACHING CATEGORICAL 
POPS, BUT HAVE UPPED THE POPS SOME OVER PREVIOUS FORECAST PACKAGE 
FOR THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY TO BETWEEN SLIGHT CHANCE AND AROUND 50%. 
QPFS VERY LOW.

326 PM EST FRI DEC 14 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...GENERALLY THE ONLY QUIET
PERIODS WILL BE TONIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY. CONSENSUS WAS TO FAVOR
THE NAM-WRF HANDLING OF THE STRONG SYSTEM DEVELOPING...WHICH REALLY
WOULD BRING STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS INTO PLAY...AND A LATER ARRIVAL
OF SHOWERS ON SATURDAY. GENERALLY HAD TO ADD SLIGHT CHANCE TO
CHANCE POPS EARLIER ON SATURDAY TO BETTER BLEND WITH NEIGHBORING
OFFICES. 

GFS MODEL DOES SEEM TO BE SLOWING DOWN THE STORM SYSTEM THIS WEEKEND
...AND EVEN ITS SURFACE LOW PRESSURE PLACEMENT IS MUCH CLOSER TO
OTHER MODELS SLOWER AND MORE WRN LOCATION...ALTHO GFS IS STILL
FASTER WITH PRECIPITATION (PCPN) AND ARRIVAL OF COLD AIR ON SUNDAY
MORNING. CONSIDERED GFS TO BE AN OUTLIER...SO TRENDED FORECAST AND
ESPECIALLY PCPN TYPES IN LINE WITH THE WARMER/SLOWER NAM-WRF
SOLUTION. DONT SEE MUCH THREAT OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FOR LOWER
ELEVATIONS WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND IN FACT INITIAL DOWNSL0PING MAY
EVEN INHIBIT RAINFALL AMOUNTS IN THE CENTRAL AND SRN VALLEY.

WILL INCLUDE SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FOR MAINLY HIGHER
ELEVATIONS OF SWRN VA (2500 FEET AND ABOVE)...AND ALSO FOR THE NRN
AND SMOKY MTNS OF EAST TN...DUE MAINLY TO COLD AIR ARRIVAL AROUND
DAYBREAK WHEN DEEPER MOISTURE IS STILL AVAILABLE...AND ALSO FOR
UPSLOPE LOW LEVEL FLOW AND COLD AIR ADVECTION DURING THE DAY
SUNDAY. 

OTHER CONCERN WILL BE STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS BY LATE SATURDAY AND
OVERNIGHT INTO SUNDAY. POPULATED GRIDS WITH NAM WINDS...AND
MIDNIGHT SHIFT MAY NEED TO ISSUE WIND ADVISORIES FOR MOST OF THE AREA.
WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS UPCOMING WEATHER IN A BRIEF SPECIAL WEATHER
STATEMENT SHORTLY.

DUE TO SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GFS AND NAM MODELS...THE
COLDER MOS GUIDANCE FROM GFS WAS NOT FOLLOWED FOR THIS PACKAGE
...EXCEPT FOR FALLING TEMPS ON SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...STRONG STORM SYSTEM MOVES 
STEADILY AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT BUT NOT BEFORE 
PROVIDING A FEW HOURS OF UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE TERRAIN ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MUCH OF THE MOUNTAINOUS TERRAIN NEAR THE 
NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR -SHSN GOING 
THROUGH MIDNIGHT HERE. MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WILL BE A DRY PERIOD 
AWAITING ARRIVAL OF NEXT SYSTEM WHICH IMPACTS THE FORECAST AREA ON 
THURSDAY WITH SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR RAIN SHOWERS DURING THE 
DAY AS LIFT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION INCREASE AHEAD OF SYSTEM COLD 
FRONT. USED HIGHEST POP FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AS UPPER TROF DEEPENS 
WITH SURFACE LOW PRESSING EAST TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. HAD 
TO MIX IN A MENTION OF THE POSSIBILITY OF FROZEN PRECIP IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN THURSDAY NIGHT MAINLY SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE 
SMOKY MOUNTAINS AS SOME COLDER AIR FLOWS INTO THE REGION BEHIND 
UPPER TROF. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE RAIN GOING THROUGH THE DAY FRIDAY 
WRAPPING UP THE EVENT AT NIGHT. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS WHICH 
ARE CLOSER TO SEASONAL NORMS FOR MID DECEMBER.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
933 AM EST FRI DEC 14 2007

.DISCUSSION...VISIBLE SATELLITE PICS SHOW JUST A FEW BREAKS IN THE 
LOW CLOUD DECK OVER CENTRAL AND SRN PARTS OF THE TN VALLEY. THIS LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE IS QUITE SHALLOW PER OHX/RNK 12Z SOUNDINGS...BUT AS 
PREVIOUS SHIFT NOTED...THE INVERSION ABOVE THE CLOUD LAYER WILL MAKE 
IT VERY DIFFICULT FOR SUFFICIENT MIXING TO OCCUR TO ERODE THESE LOW 
CLOUDS. ANOTHER FACTOR...ALTHO STILL WELL UPSTREAM...IS THE 
DEVELOPING MID AND HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEEPENING LOW 
OVER THE SRN PLAINS. DECISION TO UNDERCUT GFS MAX TEMPS WAS A GOOD 
ONE...AND I WILL MAKE SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO HOURLY TEMPS AND MAX 
TEMP AS NEEDED. 12Z NGM/FWC MOS SHOWS HIGHS ONLY REACHING THE UPPER 
40S TO MID 50S.

FOR LATER PERIODS...WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE IF 12Z RUN OF GFS 
MODEL SLOWS DOWN OUR WEEKEND SYSTEM IN LINE WITH SLOWER NAM-WRF.
NAM-WRF PLACEMENT OF SURFACE LOW IS A LITTLE FURTHER WEST AND WOULD 
PRODUCE MORE DOWNSLOPING AND WARM AIR ADVECTION. NAM-WRF SURFACE AND 
BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS WOULD REALLY INHIBIT MUCH SNOWFALL...IF ANY...
UNTIL SUNDAY MORNING IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 

THUS...AT THIS POINT APPEARS ANY SNOW AMOUNTS SHOULD FALL INTO THE 
ADVISORY RANGE AND FOR MAINLY ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 OR 3000 FEET.
MORE ON THIS IN THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

330 AM EST FRI DEC 14 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE CAROLINAS...WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIR SLOWLY 
ADVECTING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME LOW 
CLOUDS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING...WHICH SHOULD BE 
SLOW TO DISSIPATE TODAY SINCE A STRONG MID-LEVEL INVERSION WILL 
LIKELY PREVENT MUCH VERTICAL MIXING. THUS...WILL BE A LITTLE MORE 
PESSIMISTIC WITH CLOUD COVER TODAY AND WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER 
WITH MAXES. A DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE ROCKIES IS 
PROGGED TO DEVELOP A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY LATE TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING...WITH THIS SYSTEM 
MOVING NORTHEAST INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY SATURDAY EVENING. 
LATEST SHORT-RANGE MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
PROGRESSION AND TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM...AND NOW INDICATE THAT THIS 
SYSTEM WILL BE SLOWER TO EVOLVE THAN EARLIER EXPECTED. AS A 
RESULT...WILL PLAN TO KEEP TONIGHTS FORECAST DRY AND MENTION 
SHOWERS BECOMING LIKELY BY LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON. WITH THE HIGHLY- 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH EXPECTED TO BECOME NEGATIVELY-TILTED BY 
SATURDAY EVENING...WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF LATER MODEL RUNS SLOW 
DOWN THE PROGRESSION OF THIS SYSTEM SOME MORE. ALTHOUGH POPS WILL BE 
HIGH FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...PRECIP AMOUNTS SHOULD BE 
LIGHT IN THE VALLEY ZONES DUE TO STRONG DOWNSLOPING SOUTHEASTERLY 
WINDS DESCENDING THE MOUNTAINS. IN ADDITION...WILL TREND A LITTLE 
WARMER WITH HIGHS ON SATURDAY ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY 
ZONES WHERE ADIABATIC WARMING SHOULD BE MAXIMIZED FROM THESE 
DOWNSLOPING WINDS. WITH A STABLE LAYER ALSO EXPECTED TO EXTEND ABOVE 
THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES...MOUNTAIN WAVES APPEAR TO BE POSSIBLE IN THE 
FOOTHILLS...AND A WIND ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED. SINCE THESE 
WINDS SHOULD DEVELOP BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON...WILL LET LATER SHIFTS 
MAKE THE ISSUANCE DECISION.

BY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AFTER 
MIDNIGHT AS 850 MB TEMPS FALL BELOW FREEZING. HOWEVER...TEMPS IN THE 
VALLEYS WILL LIKELY REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY ON 
SUNDAY...PREVENTING MUCH (IF ANY) SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. WARM GROUND 
TEMPS SHOULD ALSO PREVENT MUCH SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN THE 
VALLEYS. OVERALL...IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE MOISTURE WILL QUICKLY 
EXIT THE REGION BY THE TIME THE RAIN CHANGES TO SNOW AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...BUT SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET. IN ADDITION...UPSLOPE 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL HELP KEEP SNOW SHOWERS LINGERING IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS FOR A FEW MORE HOURS ON SUNDAY MORNING. FOR NOW... 
WILL ONLY MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...NOT MANY CHANGES IN 
SUNDAY NIGHT TO WEDNESDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. DRY AIRMASS WORKS IN 
WITH SOME ZONAL-ISH FLOW ALOFT AFTER MAIN TROF MOVES NORTHEAST. 
TEMPS COOL WITH POST FRONTAL AIR, ALSO. KEPT MAX/MIN REGIME FROM 
PREVIOUS FORECAST WITH ONLY MINOR TWEAKS. NO CATEGORY CHANGES.

ON THURSDAY  NEXT TROF APPROACHES AREA BUT MOISTURE APPEARS SOMEWHAT 
LIMITED AT THIS VIEWING. HOWEVER TROF IS QUITE ORGANIZED AND 
NEGATIVELY TILTED, SO HAVE OPTED TO RAISE POPS ON THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU, SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE, AND IN WESTERN TIP OF NORTH CAROLINA. 
KEPT PRECIP AS RAIN AT THIS POINT, OWING TO LENGTH OF TIME THIS 
FORECAST SITS OUT IN THE FUTURE, ALTHOUGH THERE APPEARS TO BE A 
POSSIBILITY FOR LIGHT SNOW IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. WELL SEE WHAT 
DIFF A WEEK MAKES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD FRONT ALMOST EXITING 
ERN MOST PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA AT ISSUANCE TIME...AND WINDS
DECREASED SIGNIFICANTLY TO ALLOW LAKE WIND AND WIND ADVISORIES TO BE 
CANCELLED ABOUT AN HOUR AND A HALF EARLY. SCATTERED POST FRONTAL 
SHOWERS LINGER...WHICH GENERALLY FIT THE PREVIOUS FORECAST POP AND 
WEATHER GRIDS FOR LATE AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING. SHOWERS ARRIVED 
LATER THAN EXPECTED...BUT GOT A QUICK ONE QUARTER INCH AT THE OFFICE 
IN MORRISTOWN...WHICH WAS APPRECIATED. LATE ARRIVAL OF SHOWERS 
ALLOWED RECORD MAX TEMPS AT TYS AND OQT...WITH CHA TIEING THE RECORD 
OF 72 DEGREES.

MOSTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT...WITH POSSIBLY PARTIAL CLEARING IN WRN MOST 
AREAS BEFORE DAYBREAK. FOLLOWED GFS MOS MINS BOTH TONIGHT AND FRIDAY 
NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL ONLY VERY BRIEFLY CONTROL OUR WEATHER...
AS NEXT SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOP. 
MODELS SHOW GOOD ISENTROPIC LIFT BY 06Z TO 12Z SATURDAY...SO KEPT 
GOOD CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. THIS LEADS TO HIGH 
POPS BY LATE SATURDAY MORNING INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. IF 
PRECIPITATION DEVELOPS AS QUICKLY AS SUGGESTED...THEN A BLEND OF GFS 
AND NAM-WRF MOS FOR MAX TEMPS SATURDAY SEEMS BEST CHOICE.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...DEEP TROF DRIVES 
EAST TOWARD THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. SATURDAY NIGHT WITH SURFACE LOW 
TRACKING NORTHEAST FROM THE TENNESSEE VALLEY OF NORTHERN ALABAMA TO 
EASTERN OHIO BY 12Z SUNDAY. USED THE CATEGORICAL POP FOR THE EVENT 
WITH CHILLY AIR SPILLING SOUTHEAST BEHIND SYSTEM COLD FRONT. USED 
RAIN SHOWERS CHANGING TO SNOW SHOWERS MAINLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
INCLUDING CUMBERLAND PLATEAU/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MOUNTAINS 
BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA. SUFFICIENT ENERGY DROPPING THROUGH THE 
BASE OF THE SLOWLY DEPARTING UPPER TROF TO KEEP A POPS ALIVE WELL 
INTO SUNDAY. MIX IN A FEW -SHSN WITH THE RAIN ACROSS THE GREAT 
VALLEY FROM THE KNOXVILLE VICINITY NORTHEAST TO THE TRI-CITIES 
SUNDAY MORNING. SOME OROGRAPHIC LIFT ONGOING LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
INTO SUNDAY EVENING AS NORTHWESTERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WORKS ON 
MOISTURE AROUND 800 MB AND BELOW. BEST SHOT AT A BIT OF SNOW WILL BE 
IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHEST VIRGINIA AND IN THE MOUNTAINS 
BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA. PAINTED IN SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL IN THESE 
AREAS WITH HIGHEST AMOUNTS AT THIS POINT TOPPING OUT AROUND ONE 
INCH. LATER MODEL RUNS WILL CLARIFY HOW QUICKLY MOISTURE AND LIFT 
DEPART THE FORECAST AREA FOR A BETTER FOCUS ON WINTER PRECIP. KEPT 
THE DRY FORECAST GOING THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD 
WITH HIGHER PRESSURE MAKING ITS WAY GRADUALLY EAST ACROSS THE 
EASTERN U.S. AS ANOTHER UPPER TROF APPROACHES THE REGION BUT NOT 
UNTIL LATE THURSDAY AND POSSIBLY FRIDAY. LEFT POPS OUT FOR NOW WITH 
THIS NEXT SYSTEM BUT ADDED AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS. DIDNT STRAY TOO 
FAR FROM SUGGESTED MOS TEMPS GUIDANCE DURING THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A LARGE LOW PRESSURE AREA ACROSS 
KY AND MIDDLE AND WEST TN MARKED A COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDED SW TO 
THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO. A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS WAS MOVING NE TO 
THE WEST OF THE FRONT WEST OF A JKL TO BNA LINE. SKIES WERE MOSTLY 
CLOUDY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH VERY MILD TEMPERATURES IN THE 
UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. THE FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON DROPPING TEMPERATURES FROM MOSTLY MORNING 
HIGHS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE CURRENT TEMPERATURES. THE RAIN SHOWERS 
WILL FOLLOW THE FRONT BUT SHOULD MOVE OUT BY AROUND 14/00Z WEST AND 
DURING THE EVENING EAST. WINDS HAVE PICKED UP TO 10 TO 15 MPH WITH 
HIGHER GUSTS AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND COULD INCREASE TO 20 TO 25 MPH 
WITH GUSTS TO 35 MPH BEFORE THE FRONT MOVES THOUGH TODAY. RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS WILL NOT BE THAT HIGH WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. A SIGNIFICANT DROP IN 
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT AS WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION AND CLEARING SKIES 
OCCUR. STILL LOWS WILL ONLY BE IN THE MID 30S TO LOWER 40S...STILL 
ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.  

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN
ON FRIDAY WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND MILD TEMPS. PATTERN CHANGES 
RAPIDLY FRI NIGHT WITH ELEVATED WAA AND MOISTURE ADVECTION IN 
STRENGTHENING SW FLOW. CLOUD COVER WILL INCREASE OVERNIGHT. BACKED 
OFF SOME ON RAIN CHANCES BUT LIGHT RAIN COULD MOVE IN LATE. 
DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES NE THROUGH TN RVR VLY ON SAT. 
LOW TRACK WILL BE CRITICAL IN RESULTING WEATHER FOR SAT. STRENGTH 
AND TRACK OF LOW COULD RESULT IN GOOD DOWNSLOPE WIND EVENT FOR NE 
TN. BESIDE STRONG WINDS...TEMPS MAY BE WARMER AND PCPN LESS THAN MOS 
NUMBERS AND GRIDDED FCST. COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH SAT EVENING. RAIN 
WILL CHANGE TO SNOW SAT NIGHT BUT POST FRONTAL MOISTURE LOOKS 
SHALLOW AND ACCUMULATION SHOULD BE LIMITED TO HIGHEST ELEVATIONS.

A FRONT HAS BECOME STATIONARY ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND SOUTHEAST KY
INTO SOUTHERN WV. AREA OF RAIN OVER MIDDLE TN APPEARS TO BE
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT AND WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT AT THE 300 K
LEVEL. THE MODELS SHOW A SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT IN
MIDDLE TN OVERNIGHT...TAKING THE BOUNDARY AND THE ISENTROPIC LIFT
FARTHER NORTH. THIS WILL RESULT IN THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA SEEING THE MOST RAIN OVERNIGHT...WHILE THE
MOUNTAINS WILL LIKELY SEE VERY LITTLE RAIN. WILL ADJUST THE POPS TO
RAISE NORTHWEST AND LOWER IN THE EAST. ONLY SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS WILL
BE NEEDED TO TEMPERATURES.

335 PM EST WED DEC 12 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SHOWERS...MOSTLY LIGHT...
CONTINUE TO DEVELOP ALONG THE COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST AND MOVE E TO
NE ACROSS MAINLY PARTS OF EAST TN THIS AFTERNOON. INCREASED THE
LATE AFTERNOON POP GRIDS TO LIKELY CATEGORY FOR THE MOST LIKELY
AREAS THAT THESE SHOWERS WILL PASS ACROSS. NO THREAT OF RECORD
HIGHS TODAY AS CLOUDS AND SHOWERS HAVE HELD TEMPS IN THE UPPER 50S
TO UPPER 60S ...WITH CHA STILL RUNNING 3 TO 4 DEGREES BELOW THE
RECORD HIGH OF 72 DEGS SET IN 1931.

SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER NEW MEXICO WILL LIFT NE OVERNIGHT AND SHOULD 
SPREAD SHOWERS INTO ALL AREAS AFTER MIDNIGHT. SURFACE LOW 
DEVELOPMENT WILL PUSH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY NORTH INTO KY AND SW VA 
OVERNIGHT...FOLLOWED BY COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE LATE THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON. PREVIOUS POP GRIDS WERE GENERALLY RIGHT ON TRACK WITH 
SLIGHT INCREASES LATE TONIGHT AND CLOSER TO 100 PERCENT ON THURSDAY 
MORNING. PRECIPITATION SHOULD END BY THURSDAY EVENING...BUT CARRIED 
VERY LOW POPS FOR ERN AREAS UP TO MIDNIGHT AS BEFORE. 

MOS TEMPS VERY CLOSE ALL PERIODS...WITH A SLIGHT PREFERENCE FOR 
COOLEST MAX TEMPS THURSDAY AND MILDER MINS THURSDAY NIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS INDICATING A 
SURFACE LOW AND ITS ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH PUSHING INTO THE AREA 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.  BEST MOISTURE HOLDS OFF UNTIL SATURDAY.  
WILL KEEP ONLY 20-40 POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT WITH BEST CHANCES IN THE 
WEST CLOSER TO THE LOW.  SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR MAINLY RAIN ON 
FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP THE RAIN/SNOW WORDING IN THE NORTHERN 
AREAS AND THE MOUNTAINS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.  AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
TRACKS ACROSS THE AREA ON SATURDAY ALONG WITH ABUNDANT MOISTURE... 
WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS FOR SATURDAY.  UPPER TROUGH FOLLOWS ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP 40-60 POPS WITH BEST CHANCES IN THE 
NORTH.  COOLER TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO EXPECTED...SHOULD SEE SNOW 
SHOWERS BY SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT BEST MOISTURE ALREADY EAST...SO 
SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL IS NOT EXPECTED.  SHORTWAVE EXITING THE AREA ON 
SUNDAY...BEST CHANCES SHOULD BE IN THE MORNING HOURS.  KEPT LOW POPS 
FOR THE MOUNTAINS ON SUNDAY NIGHT WITH WEAK UPSLOPE POSSIBLE.  HIGH 
PRESSURE PUSHES IN ON MONDAY.  ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH 
THE AREA ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...TOO DRY TO ADD ANY 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES AT THIS TIME.  HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS ON TUESDAY 
BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.  STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC 
GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...SHOWERS OCCURRING ALONG FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR WEST 
WERE MOVING EAST ACROSS OUR NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES...WHILE A FEW 
SPRINKLES HAD REACHED THE SEQUATCHIE VALLEY. TIMING OF INCREASING 
POPS IN FORECAST GRIDS LOOKS GOOD...AND CURRENT COVERAGE DOES NOT 
INDICATE A NEED TO INCREASE POPS AT THIS TIME.

SOME HIGHER ELEVATION SPOTS HAD BRISK AND GUSTY SW WINDS EARLIER
...BUT THESE SPEEDS WERE DECREASING WITH VAD WIND PROFILES NOT 
SHOWING MUCH CONCERN FOR GUSTY WINDS TODAY.

LATEST NGM/FWC MOS SUGGESTS MAINLY 60S FOR TODAY...SO NO RECORD

423 AM EST WED DEC 12 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD FRONT TO THE WEST WAS NOW 
MOVING WEST OF THE OHIO AND MISSIPPI RIVERS WITH MOST OF THE 
PRECIPITATION ALONG AND BEHIND IT. STRONG HIGH PRESSURE AT THE 
SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL SHIFT EAST AS THE FRONT MOVES SLOWLY TOWARDS 
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD AGAIN 
TODAY AND POSSIBLY NEAR A RECORD AT CHATTANOOGA. SHOWERS SHOULD 
BEGAN TO AFFECT THE WESTERN SECTIONS LATE THIS MORNING AND THE REST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. THE FRONT WILL NOT MOVE VERY 
FAR AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES UP FROM THE SOUTH ALONG THE FRONT. 
FOLLOWED THE HIGHER MAV NUMBERS FOR HIGHS AND ADDED A DEGREE AND 
WENT BELOW POP GUIDANCE TODAY DUE TO THE SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESS OF 
THE PRECIPITATION WHICH WAS STILL WEST OF BNA EARLY THIS MORNING.   

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...COLD FRONT AND WIDESPREAD 
CONVECTION MOVES ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
IN FRI WITH BRIEF COOLING TREND. FAST MOVING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
MOVES UP FROM THE SW SAT BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND OF WIDESPREAD 
PRECIPITATION. THE LOW IS PROGGED TO MOVE EAST THOUGH THE 
APPALACHIANS BY SAT EVENING. FREEZING LEVEL LOWERS TO THE SURFACE 
AROUND SAT MIDNIGHT. MAJORITY OF MOISTURE WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA 
BY THEN AS RAIN CHANGES TO SNOW. WARM INITIAL SURFACE TEMPS SHOULD 
HINDER ACCUMULATIONS OUTSIDE THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE UPSLOPE 
FLOW WILL ENHANCE SNOW SHOWERS. A COUPLE OF INCHES OF SNOW IS 
POSSIBLE BY SUNDAY ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN. COLD HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. A CLIPPER MAY AFFECT 
NORTHERN AREAS LATE MONDAY BUT WILL HANDLE AS INCREASED CLOUD COVER 
FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY...A WARM FRONT EXTENDING ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE 
APPALACHIANS...AND AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION...WITH A FEW HIGH CLOUDS OVER MIDDLE TN AND 
SOUTHEAST KY. THINK THAT TEMPS SHOULD FALL CLOSE TO THE CURRENT 
DEWPOINTS...WHICH THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS COVERED. DECENT LOW-LEVEL 
MOISTURE SHOULD COMBINE WITH THE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES TO PRODUCE SOME 
PATCHY DENSE FOG LATER TONIGHT...MAINLY NEAR THE WATERWAYS AND IN 
LOW LYING AREAS. 

WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS 
EVENING TO MAINLY TWEAK SKY CONDITIONS...WINDS AND TEMPS A LITTLE 
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

217 PM EST TUE DEC 11 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...FOR TONIGHT...PLENTY OF LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE COMBINED WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKY WILL ALLOW PATCHY 
DENSE FOG TO REDEVELOP.

A UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE UPPER GREAT LAKES WILL AID IN 
DROPPING COLD FRONT...CURRENTLY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY...SOUTH INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY. MODELS SHOW THE BAROCLINIC ZONE 
WEAKENING AS IT PUSHES INTO THE REGION...BUT WILL BE ENOUGH 
FRONTOGENETIC LIFT TO PRODUCE SCATTERED-BROKEN LIGHT SHOWERS.

FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...A SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE WILL MOVE 
QUICKLY ALONG THE BAROCLINIC ZONE WITH WEAK CYCLOGENESIS EXPECTED 
OVER/NEAR THE FORECAST AREA. THE TIGHTENING BAROCLINIC ZONE WILL 
STRENGTHEN BOTH ISENTROPIC LIFT FOR LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH A 
DECENT FRONTAL PASSAGE FOR THURSDAY. ALSO...A STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET
MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TO THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL 
PLACE THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION.
HAVE UPPED POPS FOR THURSDAY TO CAT AREA-WIDE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...THE COLD FRONT WILL BE NEAR THE MOUNTAINS 
AROUND 00Z FRIDAY...AND WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP EAST BEFORE 
MIDNIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE 
NORTHWEST...BRINGING DRIER AND COOLER AIR...WITH HIGHS ON FRIDAY IN 
THE 50S. 

THE MODELS ARE SHOWING A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT STORM AFFECTING THE 
AREA OVER THE WEEKEND. THE ECMWF SHOWS AN UPPER LOW CLOSING OFF OVER 
THE OHIO VALLEY...RESULTING IN A SLOWER SYSTEM AND A SURFACE LOW 
PASSING TO OUR NORTH...WHICH IS ABLE TO DRAW WARMER AIR FARTHER 
NORTH. THE GFS SHOWS A FASTER OPEN TROUGH WITH A SLIGHT NEGATIVE 
TILT...RESULTING IN A DEEPER SURFACE LOW PASSING TO OUR SOUTH AND 
COLDER 850 MB TEMPS. THESE DIFFERENCES WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON QPF 
AND P-TYPE THAT ARE DIFFICULT TO SPECIFY THIS FAR OUT. COMPARED TO 
THE 06Z GFS...THE 12Z GFS HAS TRENDED WEAKER WITH THE SURFACE LOW 
AND NOT AS DEEP/NEGATIVELY TILTED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH. GIVEN THE 
BETTER CONSISTENCY OF THE ECMWF AND HPCS PREFERENCE FOR IT...WILL 
LEAN TOWARD A WARMER AND SLOWER SOLUTION. 

ONSET OF PRECIP LOOKS TO BEGIN FRIDAY NIGHT IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
MIDLEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT AND WARM ADVECTION. PRECIP WILL HAVE TO 
OVERCOME SOME DRY AIR AT THE LOW LEVELS...AND RESULTING EVAPORATIVE 
COOLING MAY CREATE A DEEP NEAR-FREEZING ISOTHERMAL LAYER. THUS 
PRECIP MAY BEGIN AS SNOW IN NORTHERN SECTIONS BEFORE THE 850 WARM 
FRONT PASSES AND CHANGES PRECIP TO RAIN. SINCE THE WARMER ECMWF IS 
PREFERRED...PRECIP WILL BE FORECAST AS ALL RAIN ON SATURDAY. RAISED 
POPS TO LIKELY ON SATURDAY. THE SLOWER ECMWF SOLUTION MOVES THE 
850/700 MB TROUGH ACROSS ON SATURDAY NIGHT...BRINGING STRONG COLD 
ADVECTION AND A CHANGE TO SNOW. MOISTURE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
LOW...STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES...AND STRONG UPSLOPE FLOW WILL 
KEEP A CHANCE OF SNOW IN THE NORTHERN 2/3 AND MOUNTAINS INTO SUNDAY. 
DEPENDING ON THE TRACK AND SPEED OF THE LOW...SIGNIFICANT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS COULD BE POSSIBLE IN THE MOUNTAINS. A RIDGE BUILDS 
INTO THE AREA ON MONDAY...BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR THE BEGINNING OF 
THE WEEK WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND.

810 PM EST SUN DEC 9 2007

.DISCUSSION...STRONG COLD FRONT LIES NEAR OHIO RIVER AND MOVING 
SLOWLY SOUTHWARD-ISH ATTM. TEMP/DEWPOINTS AHEAD OF THE FRONT MORE 
LIKE OCTOBER AROUND HERE. FRONT IS PRODUCING FAIRLY STRONG 
CONVECTIVE CELLS TO THE NORTH, WITH SOME TRAINING EFFECTS OBVIOUS 
AND POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING IN PLACES UP THERE. DOWN HERE, THOUGH, 
THERE HAS NOT BEEN AS MUCH RAIN, AND SO THERE IS NO REAL FLOOD 
POTENTIAL, ESPECIALLY WITH THE CURRENT DROUGHT CONDITIONS MAKING 
SOILS SO DRY.

BIGGER THREAT HERE IS LACK OF WIND WITH GRADIENT DYING OFF AT NIGHT, 
AND CLOUDS BREAKING APART ENOUGH TO ALLOW SERIOUS RADIATIVE COOLING. 
FOG IS PRETTY THICK IN PLACES BUT IS STILL VERY SPOTTY. HERE AT THE 
OFFICE IN MORRISTOWN IT ALTERNATES BETWEEN NEARLY ZERO VISIBILITY 
AND A FEW MILES. HAVE MENTIONED DENSE FOG IN ZONE FORECASTS FOR 
TOMORROW MORNING AND IN THE SHORT TERM FORECASTS. I BELIEVE THIS 
WILL SUFFICE, AT LEAST FOR NOW, WITHOUT GOING TO A FULL BLOWN DENSE 
FOG ADVISORY, BUT WILL CONTINUE TO KEEP AN EYE ON THINGS AND WILL 
ISSUE ONE LATER IF NECESSARY. CURRENT ZONE FORECASTS LOOK FINE AND 
WILL NOT NOT ISSUE UPDATE AT THIS TIME.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...A FAIRLY STRONG COLD FRONT...
CURRENTLY ACROSS NORTHERN KENTUCKY WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH INTO THE
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST MONDAY. SATELLITE AND AREA
OBSERVATIONS SHOWS CLOUDS HAVE BROKEN OUT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF
OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT EXPECT A MOSTLY CLOUDY SKY AREA-WIDE
TONIGHT DUE TO THE DECENT BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE.

FOR MONDAY...SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED ALONG AND
JUST BEHIND FRONT PLACING BEST CHANCES OF RAIN OVER THE NORTHERN
THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. INSTABILITY SHOWS AN ISOLATED CHANCE OF
THUNDER FOR MONDAY.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WELL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN
ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE FRONT...PER GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS PUSH FRONT NORTH 
ON MONDAY NIGHT.  WILL KEEP BEST POPS DURING THE EVENING HOURS. 
FRONT HANGS TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA ON TUESDAY...WITH THE BEST 
MOISTURE  IN THE NORTH.  WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY WITH 
THE BEST CHANCES IN OUR NORTHERN ZONES.  ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHES 
FROM THE WEST ON TUESDAY NIGHT.  FRONT SHOULD STILL BE WEST OF THE 
CWA UNTIL WEDNESDAY...BUT WILL KEEP 20 POPS IN FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
FOR OUR WESTERN ZONES.  MOISTURE INCREASING AS FRONT APPROACHES ON 
WEDNESDAY...BEST MOISTURE STILL TO THE WEST OF THE CWA.  WILL KEEP 
20-30 POPS FOR WEDNESDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN OUR WESTERN 
ZONES.  FRONT PUSHES THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR BOTH PERIODS.  FRONT IS EAST OF THE AREA BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT STILL SOME LINGERING MOISTURE BEHIND IT...WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.  UPPER TROUGH 
PUSHING THROUGH ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.  BEST MOISTURE STAYS 
TO THE EAST OF THE CWA...SO WILL KEEP BOTH PERIODS DRY FOR NOW.

UPDATED FORECAST FOR TODAY...ESPECIALLY THIS MORNING...FOR AN AREA OF
SHOWERS MOVING UP THE VALLEY. ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER SHALLOW COLD AIR
AT/NEAR THE SURFACE IS AIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS. LATEST
NAM MODEL IS HANDLING THIS AREA OF SHOWERS FAIRLY WELL AND MOVES IT
ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST THROUGH 18-19Z. HAVE UPPED
CHANCES OF RAIN TO LIKELY THERE.

AREAS ARE SEEING SOME MIXING AND ARE MORE INCLINED TO LOW STRATUS. 
MOS POP GUIDANCE AGAIN VERY HIGH FOR TODAY. LOW LEVEL SPEED MAX MOVING
NE INTO AREA EARLY TODAY. ENHANCED LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS WEAK
FEATURE PRODUCING SCT SHOWER ACTIVITY. LATEST NAM INDICATES THIS 
FEATURE WILL MARCH NORTH THROUGH MRX CWA THIS MORNING. CANT FIND MUCH
ELSE TO HANG LIKELY MOS POPS ON SO HAVE UNDERCUT GUIDANCE TODAY AND
ESPECIALLY TONIGHT. LOW LEVEL COOL POOL WILL EVENTUALLY MIX OUT LATER 
TODAY. DESPITE INCREASING THICKNESS VALUES KEPT FCST MAX TEMPS BELOW
GUIDANCE...ESPECIALLY N AREAS WITH FOGGY START AND ENTRENCHED COOL POOL.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO KEEP 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  A SERIES OF 
WEAK WAVES TRACKING ALONG THE BOUNDARY WILL PROVIDE SCATTERED 
SHOWERS.  THE LOCATION OF THE BOUNDARY WILL DETERMINE AMOUNT OF 
INFLUENCES OVER THE MRX CWA...AND WILL KEEP POPS AT 20-30 PERCENT. 
THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO PUSH INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY...BRINGING OUR BEST CHANCE OF PRECIP.  MODEL RUN 
CONSISTENCY VERY POOR BEYOND THIS TIME FRAME.  GFS HAS CHANGED 
SIGNIFICANTLY FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED...KEEPING THE BOUNDARY 
OVER THE REGION.  THIS NEW SCENARIO WOULD PROVIDE A CHANCE OF PRECIP 
OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE END OF THE WEEK.  SINCE THIS IS SUCH A

ONGOING ACROSS EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. 
SURFACE BOUNDARY TRYING TO MOVE NORTH THIS EVENING. CURRENTLY IN 
PLACE BETWEEN CHATTANOOGA AND KNOXVILLE. MOST LIKELY VERY LITTLE 
FURTHER NORTHWARD PROGRESS WILL BE MADE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND VALLEYS 
OF EAST TENNESSEE TONIGHT. SOME MINOR IMPROVEMENT IN CEILINGS AND 
VISIBILITY HAS BEEN NOTED IN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA DUE TO THE 
DEPARTURE OF SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN AND DRIZZLE. WILL LOWER 
PROBABILITIES FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. A SHOWER COULD DEVELOP ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA TOWARD DAYBREAK AS WEAK

40 POP TOMORROW...AND WILL NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM THE VERY MILD MAV 
TEMPS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
GENERALLY PROJECT CONTINUATION OF UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH 
MUCH OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK. PROXIMITY OF SURFACE BOUNDARY WHICH 
REMAINS NEAR THE NORTHWESTERN PERIPHERY OF SOUTHEASTERN UPPER RIDGE 
WILL DETERMINE COVERAGE AND INTENSITY OF PRECIP. MODELS CONTINUE IN 
SOME DISARRAY WITH RESPECT TO THIS SCENARIO SO CONFIDENCE REMAINS 
LOW. APPEARS BOUNDARY WILL BRIEFLY BE PUSHED FAR ENOUGH NORTH ON 
TUESDAY BY AMPLIFYING UPPER FLOW TO ALLOW FOR MINIMAL POPS
TEMPORARILY...ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN TIER OF THE FORECAST AREA.
ULTIMATE PASSAGE OF SURFACE COLD FRONT HAS BEEN DELAYED TO THURSDAY
BY PAST FEW MODEL RUNS AND WILL RESULT IN BEST COVERAGE OF PRECIP.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVING EAST 
THROUGH N PART OF AREA EARLY TODAY. WIDESPREAD VERY LIGHT PCP 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FEATURE. MUCH OF THE PCP WAS EVAPORATING AS IT 
FELL INTO THE DRY LOW LEVELS. SOME SNOW...SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN 
REPORTED BUT MOST AREAS WARMED UP OVERNIGHT AND PCP WAS MAINLY 
LIGHT RAIN. WARM FRONT DEVELOPS TODAY AND BECOMES ESTABLISHED OVER N 
PART OF MRX CWA TONIGHT. SOUTHWEST FLOW INCREASES ABOVE THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER BY THIS EVENING. WAA AND ISENTROPIC LIFT SHOULD RESULT IN 
ANOTHER ROUND OF LIGHT RAIN FAVORING NORTHERN AREAS. NEAR NORMAL 
TEMPS FOR TODAY WITH WELL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS OVERNIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER THE 
ATLANTIC KEEPING THE MRX CWA IN SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW THROUGH MUCH OF 
THE EXTENDED.  FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL HOVER OVER THE REGION... 
GENERALLY TO OUR NORTH...PROVIDING UNSETTLED WEATHER THROUGH MUCH OF 
THE PERIOD.  WITH MODEL DISCREPANCIES...LOCATION OF THE BOUNDARY IS 
UNCLEAR AND IT/S POSITION WILL BE A MAIN INFLUENCE OF PRECIP.  BEST 
PRECIP CHANCES SHOULD STAY TO OUR NORTHWEST...BUT COULD SEE SOME 
OCCASIONAL SHOWERS THROUGH THE PERIOD AND HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE 
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED POPS THROUGH MUCH OF THE EXTENDED.  ABOVE 
SEASONAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED THROUGH THE TIME FRAME AND PRECIP 
SHOULD BE RAIN THROUGHOUT.

PRODUCTS DUE TO REPORTS OF PATCHY LIGHT SLEET (POSSIBLY RAIN AS
WELL BASED ON FORECAST SOUNDINGS) ACROSS NRN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU

THE EFFECTS OF WARM AIR ADVECTION WITH WRN MOST AREAS HAVING WARMED
INTO THE MIDDLE TO UPPER 30S.

INCREASED EARLIER UPDATED AREAS TO 30 PERCENT CHANCE...AND ADDED
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE REST OF THE PATH OF THIS LIGHT
PRECIPITATION. SOUNDINGS AND WARMING ALOFT DONT SUPPORT SNOW SO 
WORDED AS LIGHT SLEET OR LIGHT RAIN. DISPATCH AND PUBLIC INDICATED

.DISCUSSION...CLOUDS...MID TO HIGH LEVEL...ARRIVING GENERALLY AS 
EXPECTED THIS EVENING. AREA RADARS SHOW SOME VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION
...LIKELY NOT ALL REACHING THE SURFACE...SPREADING ACROSS NW PARTS 
OF MIDDLE TN AND WRN KY. BASED ON LATEST GFS AND NAM-WRF MODEL 
RUNS...MAY SEE A FEW SPRINKLES OVERNIGHT REACH THE SURFACE ACROSS 
NRN PARTS OF CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SWRN VA COUNTIES...AS THE
CONDENSATION PRESSURE DEFICITS IN THE 850 TO 700 MB LAYER FALL TO 
LESS THAN 20 MBS.  

WONT WORRY ABOUT ANY WINTRY TYPES AS WARM AIR ADVECTION UNDER THE 
INCREASING CLOUDS SHOULD PUSH TEMPS ABOVE FREEZING IN THE FEW AREAS 
ILL BE ADDING A MENTION OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION (SPRINKLES). AMOUNTS 
SHOULD ONLY BE TRACE AS WELL.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...HIGH CLOUDS MOVING INTO THE 
AREA AHEAD OF SHORT WAVE THAT WILL SWING BY TO OUR NORTH TONIGHT.
EXPECT QUITE A FEW HIGH AND MID CLOUDS TONIGHT...AS MUCH WARMER AIR 
PUSHES IN ALOFT.  LOOKS LIKE BETTER LIFT AND MOISTURE WILL STAY TO 
OUR NORTH AND WEST...BUT MODELS INDICATE ISENTROPIC LIFT MAY BE ABLE 
TO GENERATE LIGHT PRECIP IN NORTHWEST ZONES LATE TONIGHT INTO 
TOMORROW.  HOWEVER...THINK IT WILL BE DIFFICULT TO OVERCOME VERY DRY 
AIR CLOSER TO THE SURFACE EARLY ON...AND THINK PRECIP WOULD MOSTLY 
EVAPORATE BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND TONIGHT.  BY TOMORROW ENOUGH 
MOISTENING OF LOWER LEVELS MAY OCCUR TO ALLOW ANY PRECIP TO REACH 
THE SURFACE...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTHWEST 
ZONES FOR FRIDAY.  BY THEN SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR PRECIP TO BE 
LIQUID...ALTHOUGH IF ANY REACHES THE GROUND EARLY ENOUGH FOR SURFACE 
TEMPS STILL TO BE BELOW FREEZING COULD BE FREEZING RAIN/SPRINKLES.  
MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.    


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED 
WEATHER WITH GENERALLY ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS CHARACTERIZES THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD. AREA WILL REMAIN NEAR PERIPHERY OF UPPER RIDGE THAT IS 
PROJECTED TO DEVELOP OFF THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS COAST AND PERSIST 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD WITH BEST MOISTURE CONFINED TO THE 
PERIPHERY OF THIS FEATURE. EXACT LOCATION AND AMPLITUDE OF UPPER 
RIDGE UNCLEAR AT THIS TIME BUT WILL BE CRITICAL IN COVERAGE AND
PLACEMENT OF PRECIP. SURFACE FRONT WILL ALSO BE MEANDERING NEAR
THIS AREA. APPEARS AT THIS TIME THAT BEST COVERAGE WILL GRADATE
FROM SOUTHEAST TO NORTHWEST OVER OUR FORECAST AREA. AT ANY
RATE...PRECIP DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE GENERALLY VERY SIGNIFICANT AT
THIS TIME...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY CHANCE POPS THROUGH MUCH OF
THE LONG TERM PERIOD. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES FAIRLY
CLOSELY FOR TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE MOVING FROM THE OHIO VALLEY 
TO THE MID ATLANTIC COAST TODAY. ALOFT...THE FLOW WILL BE NEARLY 
ZONAL IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS. CLOUDS OVER THE AREA THIS MORNING 
WILL CONTINUE TO DISSIPATE AS DRIER LOW LEVEL ADIR ADVECTS INTO THE 
AREA. HIGH CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE TONIGHT AHEAD OF A UPPER 
JET AND A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH. THE JET AND TROUGH WILL PASS TO OUR 
NORTH ON FRIDAY...KEEPING MOST PRECIP TO OUR NORTH...BUT WITH A 
STRENGTHENING 850 FLOW FROM THE SOUTHWEST...WARM ADVECTION AND WEAK 
CONVERGENCE COULD PRODUCE SOME LIGHT RAIN FRIDAY. LOW LEVELS REMAIN 
FAIRLY DRY AND THE LIFT IS VERY WEAK...SO WILL KEEP POPS AT A SLIGHT 
CHANCE IN THE NORTH...BELOW MOS GUIDANCE WHICH APPEARS OVERDONE. 
WARM ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT PROVIDE A CONTINUTED SLIGHT 
CHANCE IN THE NORTH ON FRIDAY NIGHT. A BUILDING RIDGE TO OUR SOUTH 
WILL PUSH THE JET AND ASSOCIATED LIFT FARTHER NORTH...KEEPING OUR 
AREA DRY. AGAIN...MOS POPS APPEAR WAY OVERDONE. TEMPS WILL ALSO BE 
UNSEASONABLY WARM...WITH HIGHS REACHING WELL INTO THE 60S ON 
SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT IN THIS PORTION OF THE FORECAST.
STAYED WITH CONTINUITY KEEPING POPS CLOSE TO PREVIOUS PACKAGE WITH
SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE WITH THE HIGHER PROBABILITIES OVER NORTHERN
AND WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY THROUGH DAYTIME
PERIOD TUESDAY AS UPPER RIDGE GRADUALLY GETS BEAT INTO SUBMISSION
FROM THE PASSAGE OF NUMEROUS WAVES OF LOW PRESSURE RIDING RAPIDLY
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
DRAPED JUST NORTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. BOUNDARY DROPS INTO
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BY MONDAY BUT GETS A SHOVE BACK NORTH OF THE
REGION BY TUESDAY AS ANOTHER WAVE BUILDS NORTHEAST FROM THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. NUDGED POPS UP A BIT ON WEDNESDAY AS BOTH ECMWF
AND GFS FINALLY ALLOW PASSAGE OF LONG WAVE TROF. TIMING IS QUITE A
BIT OFF WITH THIS FEATURE AND BROAD BRUSHED POPS BACK TO SLIGHT
CHANCE WEDNESDAY NIGHT TO ESTABLISH AN IMPROVING TREND IN THIS LATE

336 AM EST WED DEC 5 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
A BAND OF LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE EXIT REGION OF THE UPPER JET AND Q-VECTOR 
CONVERGENCE. WITH DRY AIR IN THE LOW LEVELS...SNOW WILL HAVE A HARD 
TIME REACHING THE GROUND...SO QPF WILL BE MINIMAL. WARM ADVECTION 
AND ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF A SURFACE LOW OVER THE MID MS VALLEY IS 
GENERATING MORE SIGNIFICANT PRECIP OVER IL. THIS WILL MOVE INTO OUR 
AREA AFTER 12Z. STILL...WITH PLENTY OF DRY LOW LEVEL AIR TO BE 
OVERCOME...THERE WILL NOT BE MUCH MEASURABLE PRECIP. WILL KEEP POPS 
IN THE CHANCE RANGE IN SW VA AND NE TN...TAPERING TO NO POPS IN THE 
SOUTH. WITH THE WARM ADVECTION OFFSETTING ANY EVAPORATIONAL 
COOLING...TEMPS WILL RISE DESPITE THE CLOUD COVER...GIVING ALL RAIN 
OUTSIDE THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TODAY. 

AS THE UPPER JET MOVES FARTHER SOUTH...COOLING MIDLEVEL TEMPS WILL 
CREATE STEEP LAPSE RATES LATE THIS AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL ALSO SHIFT 
TO THE NORTHWEST BEHIND THE 850 MB TROUGH PASSAGE AROUND 00Z. THIS 
WILL CREATE FAVORABLE UPSLOPE FLOW CONDITIONS TONIGHT. THE 850 MB 
WINDS ARE NOT VERY STRONG...AND GROUND TEMPS ARE STILL RELATIVELY 
WARM...SO ANY SNOW ACCUMULATION SHOULD BE LIGHT...LESS THAN ONE 
INCH. DRIER AND WARMER MIDLEVEL AIR WILL END ANY PRECIP BEFORE 12Z 
THURSDAY. 

ON THURSDAY...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND A 850 MB RIDGE BUILD OVER 
THE AREA. AS THE RIDGE MOVES EAST AND A LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE 
PLAINS...A SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS ON FRIDAY. THIS WILL INCREASE 
CLOUDS OVER THE AREA AND GIVE A WARMING TREND...BUT WITH A 
STRENGTHENING RIDGE TO OUR SOUTHEAST AND A ZONAL MID/UPPER LEVEL 
FLOW...THE MOISTURE AND LIFT STAYS NORTH OF OUR AREA.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
EARLY PERIOD OF THE FORECAST WHICH PRIMARILY ENCOMPASSES THE
WEEKEND GFS/ECMWF MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF UPPER
RIDGE AMPLIFYING OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WITH ASSOCIATED DRY AND
WARMER WEATHER AS SOUTHERLY FLOW STRENGTHENS. ALTHOUGH FRONTAL
BOUNDARY JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY ON SATURDAY AND
MODELS TRY TO CREATE SOME LIFT NEAR THIS BOUNDARY. MAINTAINED DRY
FORECAST WITH POPS BELOW 15 PERCENT FOR THIS PERIOD. ECMWF MORE
AMPLIFIED THAN GFS WITH ADVANCE OF PLAINS STATES UPPER TROF LATE IN
THE WEEKEND AND THEREFORE GFS ALLOWS SURFACE COLD FRONT TO MAKE
PROGRESS WELL SOUTH OF THE OHIO VALLEY WHILE ECMWF KEEPS FRONT WELL
NORTH AND WEST OF THIS POSITION AS FRONTAL WAVE RIPS THROUGH THE
GREAT LAKES DRAGGING FRONTAL BOUNDARY CLOSE TO THE WESTERN EDGE OF
THE FORECAST AREA. WHILE THE GFS IN ITS LESS AMPLIFIED FASHION
KEEPS SURFACE BOUNDARY MUCH CLOSER TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT OCCURRING JUST NORTH OF
THE BOUNDARY ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY ON TUESDAY. ECMWF DEPICTION
RAISES PROBABILITY OF PRECIP TOWARD THE END OF THE LONG TERM LATE
TUESDAY NIGHT WITH STRONG SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT
BUILDING ACROSS THE REGION BY MID MORNING WEDNESDAY. NEEDLESS TO
SAY QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY TOWARD THE END OF THIS FORECAST AND
TRIED TO MAINTAIN SOME CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST KEEPING
SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTH AWAITING BETTER MODEL
AGREEMENT. AT ANY RATE IT APPEARS THAT PLEASANT WARM UP IS IN STORE
THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM AS RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE EASTERN

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. EXIT REGION OF 
APPROACHING AND DEVELOPING JET STREAK WILL BRING MOISTURE AND SUPPLY 
LIFT FOR LIGHT SNOW ACROSS NORTH PART OF CWA OVERNIGHT. SON


PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A WEAK LOW WILL BE TRACKING 
THROUGH TO OUR NORTH DURING THE SHORT TERM.  MAIN ENERGY AND 
MOISTURE WILL STAY NORTH AS WELL.  HOWEVER...COULD SEE SOME ISOLATED 
TO SCATTERED PRECIP AT TIMES...BY FAR...THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIP 
WILL BE FAR NORTHERN ZONES.  ANY PRECIP THAT FALLS OVER THE AREA 
LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING SHOULD FALL AS SNOW.  
TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM ENOUGH FOR AFTERNOON PRECIP TO BE RAIN.  


LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THESE PERIODS ARE MAINLY DRY AFTER LOW LEVEL W-NW UPSLOPE FLOW AND 
COLD AIR ADVECTION SQUEEZE OUT PERHAPS SOME SCATTERED RAIN OR SNOW 
SHOWERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT...ACROSS MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN OF SWRN VA 
AND NE TN (INCLUDING SMOKIES). THIS LOOKS TO BE NOT MUCH MORE THAN A 
TRACE EVENT...GIVEN FACT THAT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES WOULD LIKELY 
MELT. NONE OF THE SHORT RANGE MODELS GENERATE MUCH INSTABILITY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SO DECIDED TO MAINTAIN CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS 
FORECAST GRIDS. GFS AND NAM-WRF DIFFER CONSIDERABLY ON THE AMOUNT OF 
COLD AIR ADVECTION...BUT UPSTREAM ANALYSIS WOULD SUGGEST A BLEND OF 
MOS MINS BEST FOR NOW.

OTHERWISE...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES SEEM IN BETTER AGREEMENT OVERALL ON 
HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE SOUTH DOMINATING THE WEEKEND INTO AT LEAST 
LATE MONDAY OR TUESDAY. MEANWHILE AT THE SURFACE...A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH NRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY THEN 
LIFT NORTH AS A WARM FRONT. THIS KEEPS OUR AREA IN AN ABOVE NORMAL 
PERIOD FOR TEMPS...AND FORECAST GRIDS ALREADY REFLECTED THIS WITH 
MAX TEMPS MOSTLY IN THE 60S FROM SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. A COLD

349 AM EST TUE DEC 4 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...
HIGH CLOUDS COVER THE AREA THIS MORNING AHEAD OF A STRONG UPPER 
LEVEL JET OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND NRN MS VALLEY. THIS JET WILL 
PUSH FARTHER SOUTH AS THE FLOW ALOFT BECOMES LESS AMPLIFIED AS THE 
LOW OVER NEW ENGLAND PULLS AWAY. EXPECT PLENTY OF HIGH AND MIDLEVEL 
CLOUDS TO PERSIST THROUGH THE DAY...AND LEANED TOWARD THE COOLER MET 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS. 

THE MAIN CORE OF THE UPPER JET WILL MOVE TOWARD OUR AREA TONIGHT. 
Q-VECTOR CONVERGENCE AND UPPER DIFFLUENCE AT THE NOSE OF THE STRONG 
JET WILL PROVIDE LIFT FOR PRECIP TONIGHT...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
MOST OF THE MOISTURE WILL BE LOCATED ABOVE THE 800 MB LEVEL WITH DRY 
AIR BELOW...SO MUCH OF THE PRECIP WILL EVAPORATE BEFORE REACHING THE 
GROUND. BEST CHANCES OF MEASURABLE PRECIP WILL BE IN SW VA AS LIGHT 
SNOW. WARM GROUND TEMPS AND LIGHT PRECIP RATES WILL LIMIT ANY 
ACCUMULATIONS. DESPITE OVERCAST MIDLEVEL CLOUDS...TEMPS WILL RISE 
DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY DUE TO WARM ADVECTION AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING SURFACE LOW...CHANGING PRECIP TO ALL RAIN. BEST MOISTURE 
AND LIFT REMAIN NORTH...THOUGH BOTH ARE LIMITED...SO WILL KEEP POPS 
IN THE CHANCE RANGE. THE LOW MOVES EAST BY 00Z AND THE UPPER TROUGH 
SWINGS THROUGH IN THE EVENING. A WIND SHIFT TO NORTHWEST WILL 
PROVIDE A GOOD UPSLOPE FLOW...AND COOL AIR ALOFT WILL PROVIDE STEEP 
LAPSE RATES FOR SOME SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. EXPECT LESS THAN ONE INCH IN MOST SPOTS DUE TO WARM 
GROUND TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...AT START OF PERIOD SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE IS IN CONTROL OF AREA AS UPPER SHORT WAVE EXITS TO EAST
LEAVING ZONAL FLOW ACROSS THE AREA.

MODELS IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT OVERALL WITH BUILDING UPPER RIDGE
OVER AREA THAT SHOULD HELP TO KEEP THINGS DRY. FRONTAL BOUNDARY
SAGGING TO SOUTH ON SATURDAY SHOULD BE NEAR OR IN CWA...BUT BY
SUNDAY LIFTS TO NORTH. MAIN COLD FRONT WAITS UNTIL AFTER END OF
FORECAST TO ENTER AREA. LAST SEVERAL POSSIBLE PRECIP EVENTS HAVE
GENERALLY WAITED ON MAIN COLD FRONT APPROACH/PASSAGE FOR
MEASURABLE PRECIP. SINCE COLD FRONT HOLDING OFF TILL AFTER FORECAST
PERIOD...AND RIDGE BUILDING IN...HAVE DROPPED POPS THAT WERE IN THE
FORECAST FOR FRIDAY AND MONDAY. ALSO HAVE CUT BACK ON SKY COVERB AND
WARMED UP TEMPS FOR SEVERAL PERIODS IN EXTENDED FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...WINDS DIMINISHING ACROSS THE 
AREA AND WILL ALLOW THE WIND ADVISORY TO EXPIRE.  OTHERWISE... 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BUILD IN WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FOR 
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING OVERNIGHT AND COOL OVERNIGHT LOWS.  HIGH 
PRESSURE STAYS IN CONTROL TUESDAY AFTERNOON FOR GENERALLY CLEAR AND 
DRY CONDITIONS.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THREE SYSTEMS DURING THESE 
PERIODS WHICH MAY (OR MAY NOT) OFFER SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION (PCPN) 
TO THE REGION. FIRST SYSTEM IS A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE IN NW FLOW 
ALOFT TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...WITH HPC FAVORING GFS OVER 
NAM-WRF. THIS LOOKS MAINLY TO BE A LIGHT PCPN EVENT FOR MAINLY SW VA 
AND NE TN...WITH MEASURABLE AMOUNTS POSSIBLY LIMITED TO UPSLOPE 
AREAS. GENERALLY KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR THIS EVENT
...WITH MIXED PCPN TYPE WORDING WEDNESDAY MORNING.

NEXT SYSTEM IS INDICATED FOR FRIDAY...BUT SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN GFS AND NAM-WRF...WITH LATEST MODEL RUNS TRENDING A LITTLE 
DRIER THAN 03/00Z GFSX MOS POPS. UPPER FLOW BECOMING MORE ZONAL AND 
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPING...BUT NOTHING THAT SUPPORTS MORE 
THAN MINIMAL POPS FOR NOW. GENERALLY BLENDED POPS WITH NEIGHBORS 
GRIDS.

WEEKEND LOOKS DRY FOR NOW AS RIDGING DOMINATES...BUT DID INTRODUCE 
LOW POPS FOR MONDAY NRN AREAS...AND ALL AREAS BY MONDAY NIGHT IN LINE
WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES. WAS TOLD THAT GFSX MOS TEMPS HAVE BEEN 
INCONSISTENT FROM 00Z TO 12Z RUNS. 12Z GUIDANCE CAME IN MUCH WARMER 
ON BOTH MINS AND MAXES...SO FOR NOW I TRENDED TEMPS A LITTLE BELOW 
WARMER CHOICES.

TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS WILL DROP RAPIDLY BEHIND THE FRONT...AND 
THE COLD DRY AIR IS JUST BEGINNING TO ENTER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU 
COUNTIES. PRECIP AHEAD OF THE FRONT HAS PUSHED EAST...AND NO

20 TO 30 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 40 MPH BASED ON UPSTREAM OBSERVATIONS AND 
MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS. WILL ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE SMOKIES

INTO THE AREA THIS EVENING...WHICH SHOULD LOWER WINDS. SKIES SHOULD 
BE MOSTLY CLEAR BY EVENING...EXCEPT FOR THE EXTREME NE PORTIONS OF 
THE AREA AND THE MOUNTAINS WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW MAY PROVIDE MORE 
CLOUDS.

BRINGING DRY WEATHER ON TUESDAY.  MODELS BRING A FRONT INTO THE 
REGION ON TUESDAY NIGHT.  BEST MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH...BUT WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES.  SHOULD BE COLD 
ENOUGH FOR LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...BUT ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE MINOR.  THE FRONT SAGS SOUTH 
ON WEDNESDAY...BEST MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH OF THE CWA...BUT SHOULD 
BE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE TO KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR OUR 
NORTHERN ZONES AND THE MOUNTAINS ON WEDNESDAY.  THE FRONT SHIFTS 
SOUTH AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT ALONG WITH ADEQUATE MOISTURE TO 
INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE CENTRAL PORTIONS OF OUR CWA ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  THICKNESSES INDICATE POSSIBLE SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION... 
WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE MID MS

HIGHER ELEVATIONS FOR TONIGHT. THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT A SOLID 
LINE OF SHOWERS ALONG THE FRONT COULD BRING SOME OF THESE HIGH WINDS 
DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS...BUT WILL FOREGO THE ISSUANCE OF A SPECIAL 
WEATHER STATEMENT FOR NOW...SINCE MODELS INDICATE THAT A LOW-LEVEL 
INVERSION WILL BE PRESENT FOR MOST OF THE EVENING WHICH SHOULD HELP 
KEEP THESE WINDS FROM DESCENDING. MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO INDICATE THAT 
SOME WEAK INSTABILITY WILL DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT AS IT MOVES INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS EVENING. THUS...WILL MENTION A CHANCE OF 
TSTORMS...BUT THINK THAT SHOWERS WILL BE THE PREDOMINATE PRECIP 
TYPE. 

THIS FRONT WILL QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...SO 
THERE WONT BE MUCH OF A CHANCE FOR A SOAKING RAINFALL. HOWEVER...IT 
STILL APPEARS THAT BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A HALF OF AN INCH WILL BE 
POSSIBLE FOR MOST AREAS. MOISTURE SHOULD RAPIDLY DIMINISH AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...WITH ONLY A FEW LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. HOWEVER...DONT 
EXPECT ANY SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS...SINCE MOST OF THE MOISTURE WILL 
HAVE EXITED THE REGION BY THE TIME THE SUB-FREEZING AIR ARRIVES. 
ANOTHER QUICK-MOVING CLIPPER-TYPE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO AFFECT 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN BY TUESDAY NIGHT...BRINGING MAINLY 
LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS. AS FOR TEMPS...MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WEAK FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL 
MOVE THROUGH...MAINLY TO OUR NORTH ON WEDNESDAY. ASSOCIATED DYNAMICS 
AND MOISTURE OVER THE MRX AREA MINIMAL AND WILL GENERALLY KEEP LOW 
POPS GOING FOR NORTHERN AND CENTRAL CWA LOCATIONS WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ADDITIONALLY...THE COOL AIR MASS IN PLACE MAY ALLOW 
FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES...ESPECIALLY OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AS THE SYSTEM MOVES AWAY FROM THE AREA. A SURFACE 
HIGH WILL PUSH THROUGH THE REGION ON THURSDAY. RUN CONSISTENCY 
REMAINS POOR BUT GFS IS CONTINUING THE TREND OF BRINGING A FRONT 
THROUGH ON FRIDAY. WHILE CONFIDENCE IS LOW...HAVE ADDED 20 POPS 
ACROSS THE AREA. KEPT THINGS DRY FOR THE WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST 
ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. RADARS INDICATE SOME LIGHT ECHOES 
OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT SURFACE OBS REVEAL 
THAT MOST OF THIS MOISTURE IS NOT REACHING THE GROUND DUE TO A VERY 
DRY AIR MASS AT THE SURFACE. SOUTHWEST WINDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
INTENSIFY THIS AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT APPROACHES...WITH DEWPOINTS 
GRADUALLY RISING AS WELL. MOST MEASURABLE RAINFALL SHOULD HOLD OFF 
UNTIL LATER TOWARDS SUNSET...AS THE COLD FRONT GETS CLOSER AND LIFT 
INCREASES. 

AFTER A WARM START TO THE DAY THIS MORNING...THINK THAT MAXES MAY BE 
A LITTLE WARMER THIS AFTERNOON THAN CURRENTLY FORECASTED. THUS... 
WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST TO RAISE MAXES AND WINDS A LITTLE.

EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. WARM 
ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL LEAD TO INCREASING LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE THROUGH THE DAY OVER OUR AREA. EXPECT OVERCAST SKIES BY 
AFTERNOON...THOUGH WITH LITTLE TO NO LIFT...MEASURABLE PRECIP IS NOT 
LIKELY UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON. STRONGER LIFT WILL ENTER THE AREA 
AROUND 00Z...ASSOCIATED WITH THE 500 MB VORT MAX AND 850 MB 
CONVERGENCE. WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS IN THE EVENING...THOUGH AS 
THE SYSTEM IS FAST-MOVING...QPF SHOULD NOT BE TOO HIGH...GENERALLY 
AROUND A HALF INCH. BY 09Z THE FRONT WILL BE THROUGH THE AREA AND 
PRECIP WILL END QUICKLY. STRONG GUSTY WINDS WILL ACCOMPANY THE 
FROPA...AND A WIND ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED FOR TONIGHT...AT LEAST FOR 
THE MOUNTAINS AND POSSIBLY THE VALLEY. WILL HOLD OFF ON ISSUING THIS 
NOW AS THE FROPA IS STILL 24 HOURS OUT...AND LET THE DAY SHIFT 
EVALUATE FURTHER.

BY MONDAY...BUT WITH STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING AND SOME 
LINGERING MOISTURE AVAILABLE...WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR OUR

MOVING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE 
EXTENDED. THERE REMAINS SOME DIFFERENCES IN THE TIMING...LEANING 
TOWARDS A BIT SLOWER TRACK AND HAVE ADJUSTED POPS FOR BEST CHANCE OF 
PRECIP CENTERED AROUND SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP SOME LINGERING LOW 
POPS INTO MONDAY. BEHIND THE FRONT...EXPECT A RETURN TO DRY 
CONDITIONS THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...WILL KEEP 
AN EYE ON A COUPLE OF WEAK WAVES TRACKING THROUGH THE REGION... 
MAINLY TO OUR NORTH. GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOKS REASONABLE...AND STAYED

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE 
SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH DRIER AIR MOVING INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME MID- TO HIGH-LEVEL CLOUDS OVER 
THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. 
THESE CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO DIMINISH THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS AS DRIER AIR ADVECTS INTO THE AREA. CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO 
BE IN GOOD SHAPE OVERALL...BUT WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THIS MORNING TO 
TWEAK SKY WORDING AND TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...COLD FRONT HEADED THIS 
WAY...MOVING TO THE ESE ABOUT 23 KT.  THIS PUTS FROPA AT NW CWA 
ABOUT 13Z...KCHA AND KTYS ABOUT 16-17Z...AND AT KTRI ABOUT 18Z.  
STRATOCU DECK SLOW TO GET FORMING...SO MAY BE MORE MORNING SUN 
PEEKING THROUGH THE CIRRUS THIS MORNING THAN EARLIER ANTICIPATED.  
RAIN SHOWERS LOOK TO BE SAFELY LOCATED WELL TO THE NORTH.  HAVE GONE 
A LITTLE BELOW GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR MUCH WESTERN AND CENTRAL 
AREAS...DUE TO NATURE OF FROPA YESTERDAY IN PLAINS WHERE FAIRLY 
RAPID POST-FRONTAL COOLING OCCURRED.  

FOR TONIGHT...CONSIDERING HOW DRY DEW POINTS ARE AND HOW THE RIDGE 
SHOULD SETTLE INTO THE AREA LATE TONIGHT...WENT COLDER THAN GUIDANCE 
AT ALL LOCATIONS.  FOR FRIDAY...STUCK PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE 
TEMPS.  RETURN FLOW STARTS TO GET WARMER AIR INTO REGION...BUT NOT 
TOO MUCH YET.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MOS POPS AND MILDER 
MIN TEMPS FROM NAM-WRF FOR FRIDAY NIGHT LOOK A BIT QUIRKY TO ME... 
STILL THINKING THAT ANY MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION (PCPN) WILL MAINLY 
OCCUR WELL TO OUR NORTH IN AN AREA OF STRONG LOW LEVEL WARM AIR 
ADVECTION ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. TWEAKED SATURDAY NIGHT 
POPS A BIT...RESISTING TEMPTATION TO DROP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
THAT PERIOD...BASED ON THE LATEST OPERATIONAL MODEL RUN AND 
AVAILABLE ENSEMBLE DATA.  

TIMING FOR MAIN PERIODS OF SHOWERS FROM SUNDAY THROUGH EARLY MONDAY 
LOOKED GENERALLY RIGHT ON TRACK WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS...SO LITTLE TO 
NO CHANGES FOR THOSE PERIODS. FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECTED WELL BEFORE 
12Z MONDAY...AND APPEARS TO BE LESS COLD AIR ADVECTION ON MONDAY 
THAN INDICATED 24 HOURS AGO. STILL...AGREED WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES 
THAT THERE IS SUFFICIENT COLD AIR ADVECTION INDICATED ON MONDAY TO 
UNDERCUT THE LATEST GFSX MOS MAX TEMPS.

OTHERWISE...DRY WEATHER ON TAP FOR MID WEEK AS ADVERTISED EARLIER...
WITH MAX TEMPS RUNNING JUST A FEW DEGREES BELOW SEASONAL VALUES.
OVERALL TRENDED TEMPS RELATIVELY CLOSE TO 29/00Z GFSX MOS GUIDANCE.  
SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS MADE FOR THE NEW DAY 7 (THURSDAY) AS DRY WITH

.DISCUSSION...
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL HELP MAINTAIN CLEAR SKIES OVER THE AREA
TODAY. PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND DRY AIRMASS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES
TO WARM NICELY TODAY. CURRENT TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING A LITTLE
HIGHER THAN THE HOURLY FORECAST...SO HAVE RAISED MAX TEMPERATURES A
DEGREE OF TWO MOST LOCATIONS.

HAVE A GOOD DAY.

&&

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...VERY QUIET AT START OF 
FORECAST WITH LOW LEVEL RIDGE OVER AREA.  SHOULD BE DECENT WARM-UP 
TODAY...ESPECIALLY IN WESTERN SECTIONS WHERE SOUTHERLY FLOW PICKS UP 
FASTER.

FOR TONIGHT...CLOUDS AND LOW LEVEL PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL INCREASE 
KEEPING TEMPS A LITTLE WARMER THAN LEVELS THIS MORNING.  COLD FRONT 
SHOULD JUST BE EDGING INTO CWA ABOUT THE END OF THIS PERIOD.

FOR THURSDAY...FRONT PLOWS THROUGH IN THE MORNING HOURS.  THINK THAT 
PRECIP WILL MOSTLY STAY TO NORTH OF CWA...BUT WILL FORECAST MOSTLY 
CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR MUCH OF THE AREA DURING THE MORNING HOURS.  
PLAN ON BAND OF POST-FRONTAL STRATOCUMULUS TO COVER THE AREA DURING 
THE MORNING THEN ERODE WEST TO EAST IN THE AFTERNOON.  UPSLOPE FLOW 
INTO THE APPS SHOULD KEEP THINGS MOSTLY CLOUDY IN HIGHER TERRAIN 
INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON.  FOR HIGH TEMPS...WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE 
OVERALL...A LITTLE COOLER NORTHWEST...AND A LITTLE WARMER SOUTHEAST.

NAM TRAJECTORY FORECAST SHOWS 500 METER SOURCE REGION FOR THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON BEING FROM WRN SD/SE MT WHERE DEW POINTS ARE IN THE 
TEENS.  WILL BE LOWERING POST-FRONT DEW POINTS A FEW DEGREES.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MAIN PERIODS 
ADJUSTED THIS MORNING WERE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. REMOVED POPS 
ACROSS SRN MOST AREAS SATURDAY NIGHT DUE TO OUR AREA PROGGD TO BE 
STILL UNDER THE EFFECTS OF UPPER RIDGE...AND MOST OF THE MOISTURE 
AND PRECIPITATION (PCPN) STILL WELL TO OUR WEST. MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES START OUT IN GOOD AGREEMENT...THEN STRAY A BIT AFTER 
SUNDAY...THUS CONFIDENCE WAS LOW IN MAKING MAJOR CHANGES. FRONTAL 
PASSAGE RIGHT NOW INDICATED TO BE SUNDAY EVENING...BUT ONLY SLIGHTLY 
RAISED POPS (MAX OF 54 PERCENT) FOR NOW FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. REMOVED 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY...BUT KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE...LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE AND MODERATE COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WHICH YIELDS STEEP LAPSE RATES. NOT TOO FANCY WITH PCPN 
TYPES JUST YET FOR MONDAY.

OTHERWISE...ADJUSTED MIN AND MAX TEMPS GENERALLY EACH PERIOD MORE IN 
LINE WITH LATEST GFS/GFSX MOS GUIDANCE...EXCEPT WHERE ADJUSTMENTS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE AREA 
SHOULD BRING DRY WEATHER TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY UNDER A MOSTLY CLEAR 
SKY.  WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO DIMINISH TONIGHT AS THE GRADIENT 
RELAXES.  WITH THE LIGHT WIND AND CLEAR SKY...MAY SEE PATCHY FOG 
DEVELOPING.  BUT...PRETTY DRY IN THE LOW LEVELS SO DENSE FOG IS NOT 
ANTICIPATED.  THE CLEAR SKY WILL ALLOW GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING 
TONIGHT.  ALL THE GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT 
FAIRLY CLOSE...SO DIDNT STRAY TOO FAR.  

.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH TUE)...WEAK COLD FRONT TO PUSH IN
LATE WED NIGHT...AND EXIT EARLY THU. FORCING UNIMPRESSIVE AND
APPEARS BETTER MOISTURE WILL STAY NORTH...SO WILL GO WITH JUST SOME
CLOUDS WITH THIS FEATURE. SHOULD BE DRY FOR FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY...THEN NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES. FAIRLY HIGH CONFIDENCE FOR
PRECIP EVENT SOMETIME IN THE SUN/MON TIME FRAME...BUT MODELS STILL
IN POOR AGREEMENT ON DETAILS LEADING TO FAIRLY HIGH UNCERTAINTY FOR
THE TIMING. GFS IS RATHER FAST...AND TREND HAS BEEN FASTER. GFS
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS LEND IT ONLY TEPID SUPPORT. ECMWF IS MUCH SLOWER.
WITH THAT IN MIND...WILL GO WITH A BLEND THAT IS AROUND 12 HOURS
SLOWER THAN THE GFS. WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SAT NIGHT...THEN
CHANCE SUN THROUGH MON. WILL GO DRY FOR TUE. WILL BUMP GFS MOS
TEMPS UP A BIT FOR MON...OTHERWISE MOSTLY JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS.

LINGERS AS FAR WEST AS W TN AND CENTRAL KY THIS MORNING...WHILE MID

JET AXIS) WERE ALSO STREAMING EASTWARD ACROSS TN AND THE GULF COAST 
STATES. A FEW WEAK RETURNS ON AREA RADARS WARRANTS KEEPING A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP WHERE LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW MAY SQUEEZE OUT SOME 
SPRINKLES OR DRIZZLE. 

EXPECT VARIABLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THIS MORNING...THEN 
DECREASING CLOUDS OR GRADUAL CLEARING WOULD BEST DESCRIBE SKY COVER 
TODAY. FAIR AMOUNT OF COLD AIR ADVECTION THIS AFTERNOON...SO KEPT 
MAX TEMPS IN THE 40S TO MID/UPR 50S. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT AS 
SURFACE RIDGE MOVES QUICKLY EAST FROM SRN PLAINS AND LOWER MS VALLEY.
PREFERRED A NAM-WRF/GFS MOS BLEND ON MIN TEMPS OVER PURE GFS NUMBERS.
GENEROUS RAINFALL OVER SRN AND WRN AREAS YESTERDAY...PLUS SUFFICIENT 
BOUNDARY LAYER RH ELSEWHERE...SUPPORTS AT LEAST PATCHY LATE NIGHT 
FOG TOWARD WEDNESDAY MORNING.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...NEXT SYSTEM DUE IN IS A 
CLIPPER SYSTEM THAT RACES THROUGH THE AREA LATE WEDNESDAY/EARLY 
THURSDAY.  ALL MODELS A LITTLE FASTER THIS RUN...SO AM EXPANDING 
LIGHT POPS FOR THURSDAY MORNING BACK INTO LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  
WILL LEAVE LIGHT POPS AS IS FOR THURSDAY MORNING.  

CONDITIONS DRY OUT AFTER CLIPPER UNTIL LARGER TROUGH APPROACHES FROM 
WEST OVER THE WEEKEND.  HPC FORECASTER STATED THAT GFS LOOKED A 
LITTLE TOO FAST WITH THIS SYSTEM.  THINK PRESENT LIGHT POPS FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT REASONABLE.  WILL UPDATE WEATHER GRIDS TO HAVE ONLY 
RAIN SHOWERS...AS IT LOOKS LIKE WEST SIDE OF APPALACHIANS WILL 
WARM-UP PRETTY QUICKLY...WHEREAS EAST SIDE COULD HAVE SOME COLD AIR 
DAMMING.  

TRACK OF PRECIP QUITE DIFFERENT DURING WARM ADVECTION PHASE WITH 
SOME MODELS (ESP. GEM) SWEEPING IN LARGE PRECIP FIELD OVERTAKING 
AREA WHILE OTHER MODELS (ECMWF) SHOWED STRONGER RIDGE TO SOUTH 
DIVERTING MUCH OF THE EARLY PRECIP TO THE NORTH AND SLOWING FRONTAL
APPROACH. WITH SLOWER MOVEMENT...AM PLANNING ON FROPA AROUND
MONDAY NIGHT...THEREFORE AM BUMPING UP LOWS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND
MONDAY AND THE HIGHS FOR MONDAY...AND EXTENDING POPS TO LATER IN

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ISENTROPIC LIFT OCCURRING THIS 
MORNING AND SOME VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN DEVELOPING. 
HOWEVER...AIRMASS REMAINS RATHER DRY OVER NE TN AND SWRN VA WHERE 
DEW POINT TEMPS REMAIN IN THE 20S. KMRX AND KHTX WIND PROFILES DONT 
SHOW MUCH IN THE WAY OF DOWNSLOPING LOW LEVEL WINDS...BUT GIVEN LOW 
DEW POINTS AND LACK OF SIGNIFICANT ECHOES OVER SW VA AND NE 
TN...CONTINUED TO UNDERCUT MOS POPS FOR TODAY IN THOSE AREAS.

OTHERWISE...SLIGHTLY ADJUSTED MOS POPS FOR TODAY IN SOME AREAS TO 
BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES. RAISED POPS SLIGHTLY TONIGHT 
IN MOST AREAS...GIVEN CATEGORICAL MOS POPS AND GOOD POSSIBILITY OF 
ALL AREAS MEASURING AT LEAST A FEW HUNDRETHS RAINFALL LATE TONIGHT.
PRECIPITATION TYPE TODAY LOOKS TO BE STRATIFORM SO CHANGED TYPE TO 
RAIN VERSUSES SHOWERS. WARM FRONT WELL TO OUR SOUTH CURRENTLY...
WILL LIFT NORTH TO NEAR THE TN-AL-GA LINE BY 12Z MONDAY. SOME 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY DOES APPROACH WESTERN AND SOUTHERN COUNTIES 
TOWARD DAYBREAK...BUT FOR NOW KEPT TYPE AS SHOWERS TONIGHT WITH NO 
MENTION OF THUNDER.

FOR TEMPS...OPTED FOR MORE OF A BLEND ON MAX TEMPS TODAY SINCE RAIN 
IS NOT LIKELY TO BE SOLID OR CONTINUOUS...WITH GFS MOS THE COOLEST 
OF THE AVAILABLE CHOICES. FOR TONIGHT...CLOUDS AND SOUTHERLY FLOW 
WOULD FAVOR MILDER MINS THAN GFS SUGGESTS...SO AGAIN WENT FOR A 
BLEND. 

LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A STRONG UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY TO THE OHIO VALLEY ON 
MONDAY. STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER JET AROUND 50 KNOTS WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A WIND ADVISORY WILL 
LIKELY BE REQUIRED FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS MONDAY. THE STRONGEST 
UPPER DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH JET DYNAMICS AND QG-FORCING WILL BE 
NORTH AND WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...STRONG LOW LEVEL 
FORCING ALONG AND AHEAD OF FRONT MONDAY AS WELL AS DECENT UPPER 
DIFLUENCE OVER THE SOUTHEAST WILL PRODUCE A LINE OF SHOWERS 
AREA-WIDE. MOST LOCATIONS WILL SEE ONE-HALF INCH OR RAINFALL...BUT 
LOCALIZED AREAS OF 1 INCH+ ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS.

DO NOT EXPECT THUNDER MONDAY SINCE INSTABILITY REMAINS WELL SOUTH
OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

FOR MONDAY NIGHT-EARLY TUESDAY MORNING...WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE AND
NORTHWEST UPSLOPE FLOW WILL PRODUCE LIGHT PRECIPITATION...
ESPECIALLY NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES.

FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...WEAK RIDGE SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL
PRODUCE DRY CONDITIONS AND MILD AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES. FOR

SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FORECAST AREA DOMINATED BY SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AND RIDGING ALOFT THIS MORNING...RESULTING IN 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND SEASONABLY COOL TEMPERATURES.

SHORT RANGE MODELS AND ENSEMBLES SEEM IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SW UPPER LOW...WHICH MOVES INTO SOUTHERN PLAINS BY 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MUCH OF SE STATES FALL UNDER A WARM 
AIR ADVECTION PATTERN WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT SPREADING SOME LIGHT 
PRECIPITATION INTO THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY AND APPALACHIANS BY 12Z 
SUNDAY. THINK THAT THIS INITIAL WAVE OF MOISTURE WILL TAKE A BIT TO 
REACH THE SURFACE...WITH ANY MEASURABLE RAIN UNLIKELY OVER SWRN VA 
THROUGH 12Z SUNDAY. DID SLIGHTLY RAISE POPS FOR POSSIBILITY OF ONE 
OR TWO HUNDRETHS RAINFALL...AND TO BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORING 
OFFICES TO OUR WEST...SOUTH AND EAST.

OTHERWISE...TRENDED QUITE CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR MAX TEMPS TODAY
AND AGAIN TONIGHT. POPS CHOSEN FOR TONIGHT WERE MORE OF A BLEND 
RATHER THAN HIGHEST VALUES FROM GFS MOS...GIVEN INITIALLY DRY 
AIRMASS.  

LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN SYSTEM DURING THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD IS A DEVELOPING CYCLOGENSIS OFF THE TEXAS COAST SUNDAY. GFS 
AND ECMWF ARE IN FAIRLY CLOSE AGREEMENT IN PULLING MOISTURE NORTH 
INTO THE AREA FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPING 
LIGHT RAINFALL MOST LOCATIONS BY SUNDAY MORNING. QG FORCING...JET 
DYNAMICS...AND CONTINUED ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL PRODUCE PERIODS OF 
RAIN SUNDAY NIGHT. FOR MONDAY...UPPER TROUGH PASSES NORTHWEST OF THE 
AREA WITH FROPA DURING THE DAY. A SOLID LINE OF SHOWERS WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT. AN ABRUPT END TO 
THE RAIN IS ANTICIPATED AS A DRY SLOT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION MONDAY 
AFTERNOON.

BESIDES RAINFALL...50 KNOT BOUNDARY LAYER JET FOR MONDAY WILL
PRODUCE WINDY CONDITIONS FOR THE MOUNTAINS. A WIND ADVISORY WILL
LIKELY BE NEEDED FOR MONDAY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY...WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE AND
BOUNDARY LAYER NORTHWEST FLOW WILL PRODUCE SOME LIGHT
PRECIPITATION...ESPECIALLY FOR NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES.

ANOTHER WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR LATE TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION BY
THURSDAY. CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON TIMING OF FRONT AND AMOUNT OF
PRECIPITATION ALONG AND BEHIND FROPA.

SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT WITH NORTHERLY 
LOW LEVEL FLOW BRINGING MOISTURE AND COLD AIR ADVECTION THIS 
MORNING. VARYING AMOUNTS OF LOW CLOUDINESS CONTINUE FROM OHIO VALLEY 
SOUTHWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS...WHICH HAS 
OFFSET THE COLD AIR ADVECTION AND HELD MIN TEMPS UP THUS FAR.

THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MIXES OUT THIS AFTERNOON AND UPPER LEVEL FLOW 
BECOMES ANTICYCLONIC BY EVENING...BUT SCATTERED CLOUDS MAY LINGER AT 
LEAST ACROSS SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN. OPTED FOR MAX TEMPS TODAY JUST 
BELOW THE WARMER GFS NUMBERS.

SKIES BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR OVERNIGHT AND NORTHERLY SURFACE WINDS 
DIMINISH...SO I TRENDED JUST BELOW THE NOT AS COLD GFS MOS MINS 
WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.

LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE

WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA WITH A DEVELOPING CYCLOGENESIS OFF THE 
TEXAS COASTS IN REPONSE TO AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN 
MEXICO-TEXAS. IN RESPONSE...BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS WILL BECOME 
SOUTHERLY WITH INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT SPREADING ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY.

FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...INVERTED UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE
RAPIDLY NORTHEAST TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES. MODELS
SHOW ENOUGH WEDGING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS TO KEEP WARM FRONT
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA...THUS INSTABILITY IS LIMITED. WILL

DRY SLOT MOVING OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON WHICH

TRAJECTORY LOOKS TO KEEP CLOUD COVER PRETTY SOLID OVERNIGHT. 
ANTICYCLONIC CURVATURE OF THE FLOW AND NORTHERLY DIRECTION NOT 
FAVORABLE FOR MUCH UPSLOPE SNOW TONIGHT. COOL AND DRY CONDITIONS

POPS FOR THIS AFTN AS MOST PCPN IS DRIZZLE. ANY ADDITIONAL AMOUNTS 
WILL BE LIGHT. AIRCRAFT AND FCST SOUNDINGS DEPICT WARM LAYER AROUND 
700 MB SO MIXED SNOW NOT MUCH OF A THREAT HOWEVER SOME ICING 
POSSIBLE AROUND 3500 FEET WHERE FREEZING LAYER RESIDES. SON 
 
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT IS PASSING THROUGH THE MRX CWA EARLY THIS 
MORNING.  MAIN LINE OF CONVECTION WILL EXIT THE AREA DURING THE 
MORNING HOURS AS THE COLD FRONT TRACKS THROUGH.  BEHIND THE 
FRONT...FLOW WILL BE A BIT TOO NORTHERLY FOR PRIME UPSLOPE PRECIP 
BUT SHOULD STILL SEE SOME LINGERING SHOWERS OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
INTO TONIGHT.  WITH A GOOD PUSH OF COOLER AIR MOVING 
IN...TEMPERATURES WILL DROP SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE LIGHT RAIN TO TURN 
TO LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES.  MOST FAVORED LOCATIONS COULD SEE A 
DUSTING OF SNOW ON GRASSY AREAS...THOUGH A WARM GROUND MAY LIMIT 
THIS.  A FEW ISOLATED LOCATIONS MAY SEE A COUPLE TENTHS OF AN INCH 
OF SNOW.  OF ADDITIONAL CONCERN WILL BE INCREASING WINDS WITH AND 
BEHIND THE FRONT.  BREEZY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY...SLOWLY TAPERING OFF DURING THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.  WITH 
THE STRONG COLD ADVECTION... TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO RISE MUCH 
DURING THE DAY TODAY AND OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL FALL INTO THE 30S 
ACROSS MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS.

LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD ADVECTION WEAKENS ON 
FRIDAY...SO SHOULD SEE DECREASE IN CLOUDS.  MODELS IN A LITTLE 
BETTER AGREEMENT FOR WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK THAN THEY WERE 
THIS TIME LAST NIGHT...BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE 
DETAILS.  WILL CONTINUE TO TREND TOWARD A GFS AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN 
SOLUTION.  LOOKS LIKE SOUTHERN STREAM ENERGY WILL STAY MORE 
SUPPRESSED TO THE SOUTH EARLY ON...SO WILL REMOVE POPS FOR 
SATURDAY...LOWER POPS SAT NIGHT EXCEPT REMOVE FROM NORTHERN 
ZONES...AND LOWER POPS A BIT ON SUNDAY AS WELL.  MAIN EVENT LOOKS 
LIKE IT WILL BE IN THE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY NIGHT TIME 
FRAME.  WILL HAVE HIGHEST POPS ON MONDAY...WHEN WILL GO LIKELY ALL

237 AM EST THU NOV 22 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT IS PASSING THROUGH THE MRX CWA EARLY THIS 
MORNING.  MAIN LINE OF CONVECTION WILL EXIT THE AREA DURING THE 
MORNING HOURS AS THE COLD FRONT TRACKS THROUGH.  BEHIND THE 
FRONT...FLOW WILL BE A BIT TOO NORTHERLY FOR PRIME UPSLOPE PRECIP BUT 
SHOULD STILL SEE SOME LINGERING SHOWERS OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS INTO 
TONIGHT.  WITH A GOOD PUSH OF COOLER AIR MOVING IN...TEMPERATURES 
WILL DROP SUFFICIENTLY FOR THE LIGHT RAIN TO TURN TO LIGHT SNOW OR 
FLURRIES.  MOST FAVORED LOCATIONS COULD SEE A DUSTING OF SNOW ON 
GRASSY AREAS...THOUGH A WARM GROUND MAY LIMIT THIS.  A FEW ISOLATED 
LOCATIONS MAY SEE A COUPLE TENTHS OF AN INCH OF SNOW.  OF ADDITIONAL 
CONCERN WILL BE INCREASING WINDS WITH AND BEHIND THE FRONT.  BREEZY 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGHOUT THE DAY...SLOWLY TAPERING OFF 
DURING THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.  WITH THE STRONG COLD ADVECTION... 
TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO RISE MUCH DURING THE DAY TODAY AND 
OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL FALL INTO THE 30S ACROSS MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD ADVECTION WEAKENS ON 
FRIDAY...SO SHOULD SEE DECREASE IN CLOUDS.  MODELS IN A LITTLE 
BETTER AGREEMENT FOR WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK THAN THEY WERE 
THIS TIME LAST NIGHT...BUT STILL SIGNIFICANT UNCERTAINTY IN THE 
DETAILS.  WILL CONTINUE TO TREND TOWARD A GFS AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN 
SOLUTION.  LOOKS LIKE SOUTHERN STREAM ENERGY WILL STAY MORE SUPPRESSED 
TO THE SOUTH EARLY ON...SO WILL REMOVE POPS FOR SATURDAY...LOWER 
POPS SAT NIGHT EXCEPT REMOVE FROM NORTHERN ZONES...AND LOWER POPS A 
BIT ON SUNDAY AS WELL.  MAIN EVENT LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE IN THE LATE 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME.  WILL HAVE HIGHEST POPS 
ON MONDAY...WHEN WILL GO LIKELY ALL ZONES.  NOT A LOT OF COLD AIR 
BEHIND THE FRONT FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...SO AFTER ANY LINGERING 
SHOWERS EXIT EARLY TUESDAY SHOULD BE DRY AND FAIRLY MILD.

.DISCUSSION...STRONG COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDS FROM EVANSVILLE INDIANA 
TO JACKSON TENNESSEE TO MONROE LOUISIANA AT THIS TIME WILL MOVE 
FAIRLY RAPIDLY ACROSS TENNESSEE TONIGHT BRINGING THUNDERSTORMS AND 
RAINSHOWERS TO THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT.  CURRENT FORECAST 
TIMING OF THE THUNDERSTORMS REACHING EAST TENNESSEE 2-4 AM AND 
EXITING THE AREA SOMETIME TOMORROW MORNING APPEARS RIGHT ON TRACK.  
TEMPERATURES WILL BE TRICKY AS THEY WILL LIKELY STAY SOMEWHERE 
GENERALLY IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOW 60S FOR MUCH OF THE NIGHT...THEN 
FALL RAPIDLY WHEN THE FRONT PASSES...SO THE EXACT TIMING OF THE 
FRONT PASSING WILL BE CRITICAL ON HOW FAR THEY DROP FOR LOWS 
TONIGHT.  AGAIN FEEL THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS AS GOOD A HANDLE ON 
THE MOST LIKELY LOWS AS POSSIBLE.  THANKSGIVING WILL BE A COOL AND 
WINDY DAY WITH TEMPERATURES SEEING LITTLE RISE AND POSSIBLY EVEN 
FALLING DURING THE DAY.

ALL THIS TO SAY...NO CHANGES PLANNED TO CURRENT PACKAGE AT THIS TIME.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...STRONG 
COLD FRONT NORTH AND WEST OF THE OHIO AND MISSISSIPPI RIVERS THIS 
AFTERNOON. SHORT WAVE MOVING NORTHEAST THROUGH MID TN THIS AFTN 
AIDING IN THE STRENGTH AND COVERAGE OF CONVECTION FROM N AL NORTH 
INTO KY. EXPECT THIS ACTIVITY TO WEAKEN SOME AS IT MOVES EAST INTO 
MRX CWA THIS EVENING AS SHORT WAVE MOVES AWAY FROM AREA. UPPER JET 
STRENGTHENS OVERNIGHT AND THU CARVING TROUGH OVER GRTLKS. SURFACE 
LOW PRESSURE DEEPENS OVER OH RVR VLY TONIGHT AND MOVES NE ON THU. 
STRONG COLD FRONT MOVES SE INTO S APPALACHIANS EARLY THU. INCREASING 
WAA IN ADVANCE OF FRONT WITH GOOD LAYER SHEAR SHOULD RESULT IN 
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND SCT TSTMS. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD TAPER OFF 
EARLY THU.  TEMPS WILL BE WARM OVERNIGHT...NEARLY STEADY EARLY THU 
THEN FALLING THU AFTN. BREEZY SW WINDS IN THE MNTS TONIGHT WITH 
BREEZY POST FRONTAL NW WINDS AREAWIDE ON THU. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SOMEWHAT MORE 
ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN SETTING UP AS A SERIES OF SOUTHERN STREAM 
SYSTEMS APPROACHES THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. INITIAL SYSTEM 
WILL APPROACH BY LATE SATURDAY...BUT ITS MAIN EFFECTS ARE PROJECTED 
TO STAY GENERALLY SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA. NEVERTHELESS... 
MAINTAINED LIKELY POPS IN THE SOUTHERN TIER AND CHANCE POPS 
ELSEWHERE FOR THIS EVENT. A MORE SIGNIFICANT SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM 
WILL APPROACH IN THE LATE SUNDAY/EARLY MONDAY TIME FRAME. HOWEVER... 
PROFOUND TIMING DIFFERENCES AMONG MEDIUM RANGE MODELS CAST QUITE OF 
BIT OF UNCERTAINTY ON THE ARRIVAL AND DEPARTURE OF THIS EVENT. THUS 
HAVE NOT MADE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST. TEMPS

AREA LATER THIS AFTN. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS SHOWING REASONABLE 
CONSISTENCY IN THE SHORT TERM WITH THE APPROACH OF A SIGNIFICANT 
COLD FRONT.  BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON...GULF MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO 
REACH INTO THE REGION AS A SHORT WAVE MOVES IN AHEAD OF THE 
APPROACHING FRONT.  COULD SEE SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOP WITH 
THIS FEATURE LATE IN THE DAY THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS.  
HOWEVER...THE MAIN PRECIP WILL BE A DEVELOPED LINE OF CONVECTION 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD FRONT.  THIS SHOULD PUSH THROUGH THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT.  MODELS TRENDING TOWARD GREATER STABILITY...DIMINISHING 
THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE STORMS...HOWEVER...MODELS DO CONTINUE TO 
INDICATE SOME WIND SHEAR.  WILL KEEP CATEGORICAL POPS IN THE 
FORECAST.

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL EXIT THE 
AREA ON THURSDAY...WITH MUCH COLDER AIR PUSHING IN. WILL CARRY HIGH 
CHANCE TO LOW CAT POPS EARLY...THEN TAPER OFF. PROSPECTS FOR 
SHOWERS/SNOW SHOWERS IN THE COLD ADVECTION AND UPSLOPE FLOW DO NOT 
LOOK IMPRESSIVE...WITH MOISTURE NOT THAT DEEP AND LOW LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES NOT ALL THAT STEEP. HOWEVER...WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW

CONFIDENCE HIGH THAT WE WILL SEE SOME RAIN IN THE SATURDAY THROUGH

.DISCUSSION...SKIES GENERALLY CLEAR ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
EVENING...ALTHO SOME SCATTERED LOWER MID DECK CLOUDS DID BRIEFLY 
PASS ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND SKIRT THE NE PLATEAU COUNTIES.

FOG FINALLY LIFTED ALL AREAS AND ALLOWED SOME SUNSHINE TO DRY OUT 
THE BOUNDARY LAYER DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. FOR THIS REASON...
AGREE WITH DAY SHIFT THAT DENSE FOG OVERNIGHT SHOULD BE MORE OF THE 
PATCHY VARIETY. STILL LIKE THE WORDING WITH VSBY REDUCED 1/4 MILE OR 
LESS AT TIMES. TEMP AND DEW POINT SPREADS DECREASING ACROSS SW VA 
AND NE TN ALREADY...AND THESE AREAS WOULD APPEAR TO BE MORE 
FAVORABLE FOR PATCHY DENSE FOG.

OTHERWISE...FORECAST APPEARS ON TRACK. WILL UPDATE ZFPMRX AND 
RE-PHRASE THE AFTER MIDNIGHT WORDING ON THE FOG...AND ALSO WILL 
FRESHEN THE HOURLY TEMPS AND DEW POINTS IN THE FORECAST GRIDS.

.SHORT-TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS UPPER TROUGH DIGGING EAST SOUTHEAST ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN ROCKIES TOWARD THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS/GREAT 
LAKES BY THURSDAY. GULF MOISTURE WILL STREAM NORTH AHEAD OF PRESSURE 
FALLS OVER THE MISSISSSIPPI AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF 
AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM DEPICT INCREASING 
ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY 00Z THURSDAY. 

ALSO...MODELS SHOW UPPER DIVERGENCE ALOFT AT 300MB ASSOCIATED WITH 
LEFT EXIT REGION OVER SOUTHERN STREAM JET AND RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION 
OF NORTHERN STREAM JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. FAIRLY DECENT UPPER 
DIVERGENCE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA EARLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

AT THIS TIME...INSTABILITY-BOUYANCY IS MARGINAL AT BEST WITH CAPES 
OF 500 J/KG OR LESS...HOWEVER...SHEAR WILL BE STRONG. 0-3KM SRH WILL 
BE BETWEEN 200-300M2/S2. ALSO...FAIRLY STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER JET 
BETWEEN 35-40 KTS. SPC DAY2 OUTLOOK SHOWS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE 
STORMS FOR THE FAR WESTERN COUNTIES.

THERE ARE DIFFERENCE IN TIMING OF COLD FRONT PASSAGE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH THE GFS BEFORE 12Z AND NAM AFTER. WILL TREND 
TOWARD THE FASTER GFS SOLUTION WITH HIGHS THURSDAY OCCURING EARLY IN 
THE MORNING WITH STEADY OR FALLING TEMPERATURES DURING THE DAY.

MODELS SHOW WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE FOR NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT WITH POTENTIAL OF MIXED PRECIPITATION 
(RAIN/SNOW) FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...PERIOD STARTS OUT QUIET AS 
THANKSGIVING STORM SYSTEM CONTINUES TO MOVE AWAY.  NEXT SYSTEM 
HEADING TOWARD THE AREA WITH MODELS KIND OF ALL OVER THE PLACE WITH 
VARIED ONSETS OF PRECIPITATION IN CWA.  GFS RUSHES A SHORT WAVE EWD 
TOWARD AREA ON SATURDAY THAT WOULD POTENTIALLY CAUSE A MIX OF PRECIP 
AT SOME LOCATIONS IF IT OCCURS...BUT OTHER MODELS HOLD BACK PRECIP 
CLOSER TO MAIN SYSTEM AND LOOK MORE ORDERLY WITH THEIR TAPPING OF 
GULF MOISTURE, ETC.  SO WILL INTRODUCE SOME SLGT CHC POPS IN SWRN 
CWA FOR SATURDAY...BUT WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL SATURDAY NIGHT FOR ONSET 
IN REMAINDER OF CWA.  ONSET SHOULD HAVE TO DEAL WITH SOME 
EVAPORATION FOR A FEW HOURS...AND WITH STRONG WAA AT ALL LEVELS THIS 
THIS SIDE OF APPALACHIANS SHOULD BE MOSTLY LIQUID.  HAVE SHIFTED 
HOURLY TEMPERATURE GRIDS FOR MIN TEMP SATURDAY NIGHT NEAR MIDNIGHT 
AND STEADY TO RISING TEMPS AFTERWARDS.

DYNAMICS AND LIFT MOVE IN FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH MUCH OF 
THE AREA GETTING WET THOSE TWO PERIODS.  DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE 
PEAKING SUNDAY NIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY WITH RIBBON OF INSTABILITY 
ROTATING NNW ON BACKING LLJ.  IF ENOUGH MOISTURE COULD SURGE 
NORTHWARD...COULD HAVE SOME WELL ORGANIZED STORMS...ALBEIT POSSIBLY 
ELEVATED.  AT THIS POINT...MAY BE RESTRICTED CLOSER TO SRN PARTS OF 
CENTRAL GULF STATES FOR ORGANIZED STORMS...BUT WILL PUT IN SLGT CHC 
OF STORMS OVER WRN AREAS SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.  FOR REMAINDER OF 
PERIOD THIS SYSTEM EXITS LEAVING CWA DRY.  ALTHOUGH POPS STILL IN 
GFS FOR TUESDAY...ALL MODELS AGREE ON SYSTEM WELL TO NORTHEAST.

.DISCUSSION...CLOUDS EXITING THE AREA THIS EVENING AS HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS INTO THE AREA.  WILL UPDATE ZONE FORECAST TO LOWER CLOUDS 
COVER FOR THE REST OF TONIGHT.  VISIBILITY AT TRI-CITIES HAS DROPPED 
TO ONE-QUARTER OF A MILE IN FOG DUE TO THE RECENT RAIN.  WILL ALSO ADD 
PATCHY FOG WORDING FOR TONIGHT.  COVERAGE SHOULD BE PATCHY SO AN 
ADVISORY NOT NEEDED.  TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST 
APPEAR ON TRACK...NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...WEAK LIFT ACROSS THE 
NE HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA BROUGHT SOME LIGHT SHOWERS TO NE TN AND 
SW VA THIS MORNING AND SHIFTED SLOWLY NE OUT OF SW VA THIS 
AFTERNOON. SKIES PARTED ACROSS THE SW SECTIONS LATE THIS MORNING AND 
WAS STILL CLOUDY NE AT MID AFTERNOON BUT BREAKS IN THE LOW 
CLOUDINESS WAS BEGINNING IN MOST AREAS. UPPER RIDGING WILL BUILD IN 
TONIGHT AHEAD OF TROUGH ALONG WEST COAST AND NORTHERN ROCKIES...SO 
DRY AND MILD CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER THAN NORMAL THE NEXT 3 
PERIODS. MAV GUIDANCE LOOKED GOOD TONIGHT AND TUESDAY SO WILL ONLY 
MAKE A FEW CHANGES TO THE MAV NUMBERS. TUESDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER WITH A LITTLE MORE CLOUD COVER EXCEPT IN THE COOLER 
VALLEYS OF NE TN SO FOLLOWED CLOSER TO NAM NUMBERS.     

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...BY THE START OF THIS PERIOD 
RIDGE HAS MOVED OFF TO THE EAST AND TROUGHS ARE LINING UP TO MOVE 
THROUGH THE AREA.  FIRST TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT DUE TO 
MOVE THROUGH ON THURSDAY.  NCEP FORECASTERS LIKE THE TIMING OF GFS 
AS MUCH OF MORE THAN ANY OTHER MODEL AND ITS FROPA LOOKS TO BE 
BETWEEN 12Z AND 18Z THURSDAY.  BIG IMPACT ON LOW TEMPS THU WITH 
RESPECT TO FRONTAL LOCATION...WILL PLAN ON ONE MORE MILD MORNING FOR 
CWA.  

FOR POST-FRONTAL UPSLOPE SNOWS IN THE APPALACHIANS...GFS CONTINUES 
TO SHOW ONLY ABOUT 12 HOURS WORTH OF MOIST UPSLOPE IN THAT AREA...SO 
WILL GO WITH POPS/LIGHT SNOWS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT BUT WILL DRY OUT 
CONDITIONS FOR FRIDAY.  WILL NEED TO WATCH SHORT WAVE PASSING TO 
NORTH FOR ANY LIFT EXTENDED FARTHER SOUTHWARD IN FUTURE MODEL RUNS.

COMPACT SYSTEM SUNDAY INTO MONDAY MAY OFFER SOME MORE PRECIP...BUT
STILL A LONG WAY AWAY. WILL BRING UP POPS SOME...BUT NOT UP TO GFS
VALUES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT COMBINED 
WITH SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY BROUGHT ISOLATED SHOWERS TONIGHT.  
MAY BE ADDITIONAL FEW SHOWERS ESPECIALLY NORTH TODAY...SO WILL 
INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER NORTHERN HALF.  UPPER RIDGE WILL 
BUILD IN TONIGHT...SO EXPECT DRY AND MILD CONDITIONS. GUIDANCE TEMPS 
GENERALLY IN DECENT AGREEMENT AND LOOK REASONABLE...WILL ONLY MAKE A 
FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO THE MAV NUMBERS.     

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...DID NOT DO ANY SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES TO THE EXTENDED AS MODEL FORECASTS APPEAR TO BE IN AGREEMENT 
MAINLY DURING THE FIRST TWO THIRDS OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. DRY WEATHER 
STILL PROGGED FOR TUESDAY WITH RIDGE IN PLACE AS AMPLIFYING PLAINS 
UPPER TROF BUILDS STEADILY EAST. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTION 
INCREASES DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY AS A COUPLE OF WEAK VORT MAXES 
SHIFT NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. STAYED 
WITH THE CHANCE TYPE POPS FOR SHOWERS HERE WHILE KEEPING LIKELY POPS 
FOR SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
THANKSGIVING MORNING. FRONT MOVES AWAY DURING THE HOLIDAY BUT 
MAINTAINED CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS SIGNIFICANT LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE CONTINUES TO ADVECT INTO THE REGION IN CYCLONIC FLOW. 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT INCREASES IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME AND WITH 
SUFFICIENT CAA MIXED IN SOME SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING. THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST 
STAYED SOMWHAT CLOSER TO THE ECMWF AND ENSEMBLE MEAN AS THE GFS 
APPEARS TO BE TOO AMPLIFIED WITH WAVE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE GULF OF 
MEXICO AT THIS TIME. MAINTAINED SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR A SHOWER ON 
SUNDAY WITH WEAK UPPER LEVEL WAVE AND INDICATION OF SOME LOW LEVEL 
INVERTED TROFFING. DID NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM MEX MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS 
WHICH FEATURE WELL ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS FIRST COUPLE DAYS TRENDING

.SHORT TERM...HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE SLOWLY SLIPPING TO THE
EAST WITH A LITTLE WARMER MOISTER AIRMASS COMING INTO PLAY FOR

CLOUDINESS PARTICULARLY IN THE SOUTH TO BEGIN THE DAY AND A FEW
SPRINKLES CANNOT BE RULED OUT. FEEL THERE IS NOT ENOUGH MOISTURE OR
LIFT TO GENERATE MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION SO KEPT POPS AT 14 OR
BELOW. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES APPEARED REASONABLE SO DID NOT DEVIATE
GREATLY THERE.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...NOT TOO MANY CHANGES IN
FORECAST AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING STILL WILL STRENGTHEN OVER THE
FORECAST AREA THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF WESTERN STATES UPPER
TROF. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT EAST TUESDAY AND
TUESDAY NIGHT. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE VERY SLOWLY UNTIL WEDNESDAY AND
TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD AND ACTUALLY 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE
NORMAL TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. BEST WARM AIR ADVECTION WILL TAKE
PLACE WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED
FRONTAL SYSTEM ADVANCES TO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY.
BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AND THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. LOOKS LIKE TEMPERATURES WILL
BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL RAIN FOR THE MOST PART THURSDAY NIGHT. ONLY
THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS MAY SEE SOME SNOW THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY
WITH NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BEFORE THE PRECIPITATION ENDS. HAVE
WARMED THURSDAY NIGHTS LOWS A FEW DEGREES WITH NEW MOS GUIDANCE

HAVE PUSHED BACK WIND SHIFT AND ASSOCIATED DEWPOINTS AS WELL AS
ONSET OF PRECIP CHANCES. WEDNESDAY MORNING AND POSSIBLY THURSDAY
MORNING COULD HAVE LOW TEMPS WELL ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGES DUE TO
STRONG PUSH OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. RIGHT NOW FRONT TOO CLOSE TO

ALL NIGHT WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

HAVE TRIMMED BACK ON EXTENT OF THUNDER SLIGHTLY AT MID WEEK...WITH IT
LOOKING LIKE RICHEST LOW LEVEL DEWPOINTS AND FRONTAL PASSAGE
OCCURING AT COOLER TIME OF THE DAY ON THURSDAY. IF FRONT SPEEDS UP
OR SLOWS DOWN...THEN MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF STORMS UTILIZING

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...QUIET FIRST PART OF
PERIOD...STILL LOOKING WET NEAR THANKSGIVING. MODELS AND NCEP
FORECASTERS TRYING TO SLOW DOWN PROGRESSION OF SYSTEM FOR MID WEEK.
HAVE PUSHED BACK WIND SHIFT AND ASSOCIATED DEWPOINTS AS WELL AS
ONSET OF PRECIP CHANCES. WEDNESDAY MORNING AND POSSIBLY THURSDAY
MORNING COULD HAVE LOW TEMPS WELL ABOVE SEASONAL AVERAGES DUE TO
STRONG PUSH OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. RIGHT NOW FRONT TOO CLOSE TO
CALL FOR THURSDAY MORNING...SO HAVE LOW TEMP AND DEW POINTS HIGHER
THAN NORMAL...BUT NOT AS HIGH AS IF FRONT FOR SURE WOULD STAY WEST
ALL NIGHT WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

HAVE TRIMMED BACK ON EXTENT OF THUNDER SLIGHTLY AT MID WEEK...WITH IT
LOOKING LIKE RICHEST LOW LEVEL DEWPOINTS AND FRONTAL PASSAGE
OCCURING AT COOLER TIME OF THE DAY ON THURSDAY. IF FRONT SPEEDS UP
OR SLOWS DOWN...THEN MIGHT HAVE A BETTER CHANCE OF STORMS UTILIZING
SURFACE HEATING EITHER WED AFTN OR THU AFTN.

STILL KEEPING IN MENTION OF POST-FRONTAL SHRA/SHSN IN HIGHER
ELEVATIONS THURSDAY NIGHT AND INTO FRIDAY.

THROUGH AREA SUNDAY WITH GFS STILL HOLDING ONTO SOME
SPRINKLES...BUT OTHER MODELS DRY OVER CWA. WITH NCEP FORECASTERS
NOT FAVORING GFS WILL LEAVE FORECAST DRY FOR SUNDAY. ALL MODELS
AGREE THAT SHORTWAVE WILL BE PAST AREA BY MONDAY...WITH RIDGE OVER

NEXT CHANCE FOR GOOD PRECIP COVERAGE COMES MID WEEK WHEN MAJOR
TROUGH TRACKS ACROSS THE U.S.  MODELS FAIRLY CONSISTENT ON PRESENCE
OF TROUGH...BUT CHARACTER OF TROUGH QUITE DIFFERENT BETWEEN MODELS.
AT ANY RATE LOOKS LIKE GOOD LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN BY THAT TIME
SO WILL INTRODUCE SOME THUNDER INTO WEATHER GRIDS STARTING
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.

LOOKS LIKE FRONTAL PASSAGE AIMED AT THANKSGIVING DAY RIGHT NOW.  
DEPENDING ON TIMING MIGHT STILL HAVE A CHANCE OF THUNDER AGAIN FOR 
THANKSGIVING DAY...BUT ALL MODELS AGREE THAT COLD FRONT AND DEEP 
MOISTURE WILL BE OUT OF AREA BY 00Z FRIDAY.

MOIST AND COLD LOW-LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW EXPECTED THU NIGHT AND 
POSSIBLY INTO FRIDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE MENTION OF SHSN FOR HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS INTO FRIDAY.  AS OF NOW...GFS SUBSIDENCE ERODES MOUNTAIN 
MOISTURE WITHIN 12 HOURS...IF THATS THE CASE THEN SHOW AMOUNTS IN

SIMILAR GFS/ECMWF AS A COUPLE OF WEAK SHORTWAVES DROP SOUTHEAST OUT 
OF THE GREAT LAKES WHILE A SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE TRIES TO FORM OVER

A DEEP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS THE AREA. COLD

SEEN SOME LIGHT FLURRIES HERE AT THE OFFICE. WITH A PERSISTENT 
STRONG UPSLOPE FLOW...COLD MIDLEVEL TEMPS THROUGH MIDNIGHT...AND 
ADDITIONAL UPSTREAM MOISTURE...EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE SOME 
ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WILL KEEP THE SNOW ADVISORY 
GOING...BUT END IT AT MIDNIGHT. WILL ALSO MENTION FLURRIES IN THE 
VALLEY AS FAR SOUTH AS KNOXVILLE BASED ON RADAR TRENDS. DECREASING 
MOISTURE SHOULD END MOST OF THE ACCUMULATING PRECIP AFTER 06Z...AND 
WILL CARRY ONLY SCATTERED FLURRIES AFTER THAT TIME. 

WINDS HAVE NOT BEEN QUITE AS STRONG AS EXPECTED...WITH 15-20 MPH IN 
THE VALLEY AND 20-30 MPH IN THE MOUNTAINS. WILL CANCEL THE LAKE WIND 
ADVISORY AND KEEP THE WIND ADVISORY GOING IN THE MOUNTAINS UNTIL 
MIDNIGHT. CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE UPPER 
TROUGH MOVES AWAY AND MIDLEVEL TEMPS WARM. EXPECT CLEAR TO MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES BY SUNRISE. UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE SEEN IN WV IMAGERY OVER 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL BRING SOME HIGH CLOUDS TO NORTHERN SECTIONS 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON...BUT OVERALL FRIDAY SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY.

LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THANKSGIVING)...

NEXT WEEK. MODELS FAIRLY CONSISTENT THROUGH ABOUT 12Z
WEDNESDAY...AFTERWARDS ECMWF LEAVES TROUGH OUT WEST WHILE OTHER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR INDICATING SOME LIGHT RAIN 
IN THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE CWA WITH THE FRONT PUSHING THROUGH.  
MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST OF THE AREA. 
COLD AIR PUSHING IN BEHIND THE FRONT.  PROBABLY WONT SEE 
TEMPERATURES RISE MUCH TODAY. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR 
TEMPERATURES.  WITH THE TIGHT GRADIENT...WILL PROBABLY SEE WINDY 
CONDITIONS TODAY.  WILL KEEP WIND ADVISORY GOING FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS... BUT WILL ADD A LAKE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE VALLEY FOR 
TODAY.  A SHORTWAVE TRACKS IN TONIGHT.  BEST MOISTURE REMAINS TO THE 
NORTH....BUT MAY SEE MINOR ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF 
SOUTHWEST VA AND EAST TN TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD 
ACROSS THE REGION FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND 
SEASONAL TEMPS EXPECTED. ON SUNDAY...LONG-RANGE MODELS REMAIN IN 
DISAGREEMENT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF RAIN. GFS MODEL HAS REMAIN 
CONSISTENT THE LAST SEVERAL RUNS WITH KEEPING SUNDAY DRY...BY 
INDICATING ONLY A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. HOWEVER...THE ECMWF 
MODEL HAS ALSO BEEN CONSISTENT WITH INDICATING A STRONGER UPPER- 
LEVEL SHORT WAVE THAT PRODUCES A GOOD CHANCE FOR RAIN SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. SINCE ITS DIFFICULT TO KNOW WHOS 
RIGHT (AND NOBODY WANTS TO BUDGE)...WILL KEEP A SMALL CHANCE POP FOR 
SUNDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA (WHICH ALSO MAINTAINS 
CONSISTENCY WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECASTS). BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS AGREE THAT A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE 
REGION AROUND THE THANKSGIVING TIMEFRAME. THERE REMAINS DISAGREEMENT 
WITH THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT FOR NOW...WILL MENTION A CHANCE 
OF RAIN FOR WEDNESDAY...WHICH IS IN LINE WITH THE GFS MODEL AND THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST. HOWEVER...WOULDNT BE SURPRISED IF THIS SOLUTION 
IS TOO QUICK AND THE SLOWER ECMWF SOLUTION ACTUALLY VERIFIES BETTER. 
AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARD THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGH

1010 PM EST WED NOV 14 2007

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
TONIGHT. BREEZY NW WINDS WILL GET GOING BEHIND THE FRONT. WIND 
ADVSRY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON TRACK FOR THIS THU MORNING.
TEMPS WILL FALL DURING THE DAY THU. WILL UPDATE AFT 1100 PM EST TO 
LOWER POPS OVRNGT. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A DIGGING TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS WILL PUSH A STRONG COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT. THE FRONT IS NOW MOVING INTO WEST TN...AND 
IS PROJECTED TO MOVE ACROSS EAST TN BETWEEN 04Z AND 09Z. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE INCREASING AHEAD OF THE FRONT IN MIDDLE TN AS A 
MIDLEVEL CAP WEAKENS. WILL ALSO SEE INCREASING UPPER DIFFLUENCE WITH 
FAVORABLE POSITIONING OF THE POLAR AND SUBTROPICAL JETS. SURFACE 
HEATING HAS BROUGHT TEMPS INTO THE LOWER TO MID 70S IN THE CENTRAL 
AND SOUTHERN VALLEY...RESULTING IN GOOD INSTABILITY...BUT THE BEST 
DYNAMICS WILL PROVIDE LIFT AFTER SUNSET. THIS TIMING DIFFERENCE MAY 
LIMIT THE SEVERE POTENTIAL...BUT ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS WILL STILL 
BE POSSIBLE WITH DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE MAIN THREAT. POPS WILL BE 
CATEGORICAL BEFORE 06Z.

BEHIND THE FRONT...WINDS WILL INCREASE AND BECOME GUSTY FROM THE 
NORTHWEST...AND DEWPOINTS WILL QUICKLY FALL. TEMPS THROUGH THE DAY 
TOMORROW WILL HOLD NEARLY STEADY FROM MORNING LOWS. EXPECT CLOUDS TO 
BECOME SCATTERED IN THE MORNING WITH LOW TO MIDLEVEL DRY 
ADVECTION...BUT BECOME BROKEN AGAIN IN THE AFTERNOON AS COLD TEMPS 
ALOFT GENERATE STRATOCU. AN UPSLOPE FLOW IN THE MOUNTAINS WILL KEEP 
A CHANCE OF SHOWERS THERE. WINDS WILL BE QUITE STRONG...25 TO 35 MPH 
WITH GUSTS OF 40 TO 50 MPH IN THE MOUNTAINS...AND A WIND ADVISORY 
WILL BE ISSUED FROM 6 AM UNTIL MIDNIGHT. WIND IN VALLEY LOCATIONS 
WILL BE BETWEEN 15 AND 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 30 MPH.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
TEMPERATURES TAKE A PLUNGE AFTER THE FRONT PASSES THROUGH IN THE
SHORT TERM. A LITTLE WRAP AROUND SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS NOT
OUT OF THE QUESTION BUT FEEL EVEN THERE THIS TIME OF YEAR ONLY
LIMITED AMOUNTS. TEMPERATURES WILL WARM SLIGHTLY INTO THE WEEKEND
THEN A LIMITED RE-ENFORCING SHOT OF COOL AIR AGAIN ON MONDAY TO
KEEP HIGHS GENERALLY HOVERING IN THE 50S TO LOW 60S AND LOWS IN THE
30S TO LOW 40S.

ON THE PRECIPITATION FRONT...HAVE BACKED OFF THE RAIN CHANCES OVER 
THE WEEKEND AND EARLY PART OF THE WEEK AND LOOKS LIKE THE BEST SHOT 
IS TOWARDS THE END OF THE PERIOD NEXT WEDNESDAY.  GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
APPEAR REASONABLE AND VERY SMALL DEVIATION.

A SURFACE COLD FRONT IS CURRENTLY MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY.
AHEAD OF THE FRONT...VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS CONVECTIVE CLOUDS OVER
WEST AND MIDDLE TN...INDICATING AN UNSTABLE AIR MASS. BEFORE
THUNDERSTORMS AFFECT OUR AREA...A STRONG MIDLEVEL INVERSION BETWEEN
650 AND 600 MB MUST ERODE. ACARS SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS INVERSION IS
WEAKER TO THE WEST...AND MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW IT WEAKENING LATE
THIS AFTERNOON WHEN A 600 MB TEMPERATURE GRADIENT PASSES THROUGH. UNTIL
THEN WE SHOULD SEE SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS...MAINLY IN NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE AREA. PLENTY OF SUN IN THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS MORNING WILL LIKELY ENHANCE THUNDERSTORMS
AND SEVERE POTENTIAL THIS EVENING. WILL ISSUE AN SPS TO MENTION THE
THREAT OF SEVERE THIS EVENING IN SOUTHERN AND WESTERN COUNTIES. THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WITH THE RECENT RAIN...DENSE 
FOG IS STILL BEING OBSERVED.  WILL KEEP THE DENSE FOG GOING...BUT 
NOT PLANNING ON EXTENDING IT.  A COLD FRONT CURRENTLY APPROACHING 
THE OHIO VALLEY...WILL TRACK SOUTHEAST INTO OUR AREA LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT ON HOLDING OFF 
THE BEST MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS UNTIL THIS EVENING. WILL KEEP THE 
50-60 POPS GOING FOR TODAY AND THE 80-90 POPS GOING FOR TONIGHT.  
SOME INSTABILITY ALSO EXPECTED WITH THE FRONT ALONG WITH A 30-40KT

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL SWING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY...WITH SOME LIGHT 
PRECIP POSSIBLE ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS 
THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON... 
SOME UPSLOPE SHOWERS SHOULD DEVELOP ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL BE SHALLOW ACROSS 
THE AREA...SO WILL ONLY MENTION LOW POPS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. WITH 
TEMPS FALLING BELOW FREEZING IN THE MOUNTAINS...EXPECT SNOW SHOWERS 
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS (GENERALLY ABOVE 2500 FEET) BUT WITH LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS OF LESS THAN AN INCH. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD 
ACROSS THE REGION FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND 
SEASONAL TEMPS EXPECTED. BEYOND SATURDAY...MODELS ARE NOT IN VERY 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUN DEVIATING APPRECIABLY 
FROM ITS PREVIOUS SOLUTIONS. WITH A WIDE VARIANCE IN THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS BEYOND SATURDAY...WILL PLAN TO NOT CHANGE THE EXTENDED

CURRENT FORECAST SEEMS TO BE HANDLING PRECIP PRETTY WELL. MAIN
PRECIP HAS MOVED OUT...BUT STILL A FEW SHOWERS AROUND. BIGGEST
CONCERN IS HOW TO HANDLE FOG THAT HAS FORMED. MANY LOCATIONS HAVE

DEPARTURE/WEAKENING LIFT CORRECTLY AS THIS FEATURE MOVES OUT OF THE

BY MID EVENING DROPPING TO SLIGHT CHANCE MOST AREAS OVERNIGHT. MUCH 
STRONGER UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT BUILDING TOWARD THE 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND MAINTAINED SAME IDEA WITH POPS GRADUALLY 
RAISING PROBABILITY WITH BEST SHOT AT RAIN FROM 22Z WED THROUGH

SOME DEEPER MOISTURE/LIFT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND MAINTAINED SOME CHANCE AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR POST 
FRONTAL PRECIP WITH INCREASING NORTHWEST FLOW. OROGRAPHICS AND 
CRASHING THICKNESSES IN STRONG CAA BEHIND FRONTAL SYSTEM MAY ALLOW 
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW SNOW SHOWERS PRIOR TO THE END OF THE 
DAY THURSDAY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. STILL TOO WARM THOUGH FOR TALK 
ABOUT ACCUMULATION WITH THIS LIGHT QPF. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW 
THURSDAY NIGHT WITH LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE COULD PRODUCE LIGHT

235 AM EST MON NOV 12 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH A WARMER AND MORE 
MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. CURRENT 
RADAR INDICATES SOME SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN...BUT THINK THAT THESE SHOWERS SHOULD MOVE OUT OF THE 
AREA BY SUNRISE SINCE NOT MUCH ACTIVITY CAN BE SEEN UPSTREAM OVER 
SOUTHEAST KY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF 
CLOUDINESS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY... 
MOVING NORTHEAST TOWARDS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. AS A RESULT...WILL 
INCREASE CLOUD COVER OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
WITH WORDING OF PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. A COLD FRONT CURRENTLY OVER THE 
UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY SHOULD ONLY MOVE INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY 
TONIGHT...SO WILL KEEP THE FORECAST DRY THROUGH TONIGHT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND LOOK 
REASONABLE...BUT WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WARMER NGM NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT 
AS CLOUDS AND DEWPOINTS GRADUALLY INCREASE DUE TO SOUTHERLY WINDS. 


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES NOW ARE 
IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH TIMING OF UPCOMING MID WEEK EVENT. 
ACTUALLY...LATEST MODEL RUNS SUGGEST TWO SEPARATE EVENTS WILL 
TRANSPIRE AS WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION IN THE LATE TUESDAY/EARLY WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME
FOLLOWED CLOSELY BY A MORE SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH IN THE LATE
WEDNESDAY/EARLY THURSDAY TIME FRAME. THE SECOND EVENT WILL FEATURE
A COLD FRONT WHICH WILL USHER IN A SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER AIR MASS.
MODELS ALSO HINT THAT ANOTHER SYSTEM WILL APPROACH SOMETIME NEXT
WEEKEND...BUT TIMING IS UNCERTAIN AND THERE IS LITTLE SUPPORT FROM
THE ENSEMBLES. NEVERTHELESS...HAVE INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
FOR NEXT SUNDAY. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES
FAIRLY CLOSELY.

305 PM EST SUN NOV 11 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SHOWERS DEVELOPING THIS
AFTERNOON TO OUR W-NW FROM WRN KY NE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY...SEEM TO
BE ASSOCIATED WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION AND MAINLY ELEVATED
INSTABILITY (POSSIBLY ALSO HELPED BY UPPER LEVEL JET). NOT
CONFIDENT IF THESE SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE LATE TONIGHT AND HAVE A
CHANCE TO REACH NRN PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA...BUT PREFER TO KEEP
CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST AND CARRY THE LOW POPS FOR NOW.
MOS MIN TEMPS YESTERDAY WERE DEFINITELY A FEW DEGREES TOO
WARM...BUT PATTERN FOR TONIGHT SUPPORTS STICKING CLOSE TO GFS MOS
MINS.

UPPER RIDGE LOSES AMPLIFICATION AFTER MONDAY...WHILE LOW LEVEL FLOW 
STAYS FROM THE SOUTHWEST THROUGH TUESDAY. HARD TO FIND ANY FOCUS FOR 
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT FOR THESE PERIODS...UNLESS A WEAK VORT MAX MOVES 
THROUGH THE FLATTENING NEAR ZONAL FLOW ALOFT MONDAY NIGHT OR 
TUESDAY. PREFER TO KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR REMAINDER OF SHORT TERM FOR 
NOW. OTHERWISE...IT HAS BEEN TOUGH TO REACH THE WARMER MOS HIGHS 
THIS WEEKEND...SO WILL STICK A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW THE WARMER HIGHS. 
MIN TEMPS CLOSE MONDAY NIGHT AND ACCEPTED.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...GFS RATHER NICELY 
DEPICTS UPPER TROF/SURFACE COLD FRONTAL APPROACH TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY EVENING. CONTINUE TREND OF RAISING POPS FOR THE 
FROPA LATER IN THE DAY WEDNESDAY WITH LOWER CHANCE POPS TUESDAY 
NIGHT ENDING UP IN THE MEDIUM CHANCE RANGE BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 
TAPER POPS BACK WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS DRIER NORTHWEST FLOW BUILDS IN 
BEHIND THE FRONT. REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST WAS KEPT DRY ALTHOUGH 
THERE ARE MODEL DIFFERENCES WHICH PROVIDE FOR ANOTHER FRONTAL SYSTEM 
WITH A SMALL CHANCE OF RAIN AROUND SATURDAY. STAYED ON THE DRY SIDE 
FOR NOW AWAITING MODEL AGREEMENT FOR THE LATTER PORTION OF THE LONG

THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST 
VA TONIGHT...AS A WEAK WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY BEGINS TO FORM OVER 
THESE AREAS. THUS...WILL ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THESE AREAS FOR

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CUMULUS FIELD CONTINUES TO

MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE REGION. SKIES SHOULD VARY FROM MOSTLY 
CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT...WITH GENERALLY LIGHT WINDS AS 
SURFACE RIDGE TO OUR WEST MOVES SLOWLY EAST. MOS MIN TEMPS WERE 
QUITE CLOSE AND FOLLOWED WITH LITTLE VARIANCE.

UPPER RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...WHILE 
SURFACE RIDGE GRADUALLY MOVES EAST ENOUGH TO ALLOW A S-SW LOW LEVEL 
FLOW TO DEVELOP. MODELS DIFFER GREATLY ON UPPER LEVEL PATTERN FOR 
EARLY TO MID NEXT WEEK...SO TENDING TO FAVOR IGNORING THE NOISY 
LIGHT QPF THAT MODELS GENERATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. GFS MODEL 
DID A DECENT JOB WITH LIGHT PRECIPITATION EVENT LAST NIGHT...BUT I 
WILL ONLY MENTION A CHANCE OF SPRINKLES ACROSS NE PLATEAU AND 
EXTREME SWRN VA MONDAY AFTERNOON FOR NOW. THIS UNDERCUTTING OF POPS 
IS SUPPORTED BY ENSEMBLES WHICH DONT PRODUCE MUCH IF ANY QPF ACROSS 
OUR REGION THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON.

OTHERWISE...MOS MIN AND MAX TEMPS CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS 
OR A SLIGHT BLEND.  


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK WAVE PRESSES EAST 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA IN WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN AHEAD OF MAIN 
UPPER TROF FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS TUESDAY. TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT MAINTAINED HIGHER CHANCE POPS AS MID LATITUDE 
SYSTEM DRIVES EAST WITH FROPA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. STAYED WITH A SLIGHT 
CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR A NORTHWEST FLOW EVENT ON FRIDAY AND THEN 
DRIED IT OUT ON SATURDAY WITH SURFACE RIDGING BUILDING INTO THE DEEP 
SOUTH. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MEX MOS EXCEPT UNDERCUT ON THURSDAY IN 
HEALTHY COLD AIR ADVECTION AND WENT A LITTLE HIGHER THAN MOS ON

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON 
PRECIPITATION HAS MAINLY OCCURRED ACROSS PARTS OF WISE...RUSSELL
AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES OF SWRN VA. CEILINGS HAD LOWERED THIS 
MORNING WITH A FEW SPRINKLES AT TRI...BUT GENERALLY HAVE SEEN CLOUDS 
THIN OVER ALL BUT SWRN VA AND THE NE TIP OF TN THIS AFTERNOON.

UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WILL BE EXITING THIS EVENING...WITH SOME LOW 
LEVEL FORCING DEVELOPING BEHIND THE WEAK COLD FRONT. WEAK LOW LEVEL 
UPSLOPE FLOW AND LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SEEMS TO JUSTIFY LOW 
POPS FOR SWRN VA...EXTREME NE TN AND SMOKY MTNS. TYPE WOULD HAVE TO 
BE LIQUID UNTIL LATE TONIGHT...WHEN WILL WORD TYPE AS RAIN OR SNOW
(ACTUALLY PERHAPS JUST SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES BEFORE ENDING). HAVE 
COORDINATED WITH RNK AND GSP ON THE ADDITION OF LOW POPS TO COVER 
THIS POSSIBILITY...BUT STAYED BELOW THE NAM-WRF POPS AND CLOSER TO 
GFS MOS.  

OTHERWISE...UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION THIS WEEKEND...WITH
NO RETURN FLOW OF SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE...THUS MORE DRY WEATHER.
TEMPS GENERALLY STAY AROUND TYPICAL/CLIMO VALUES FOR NOVEMBER...
UNTIL LATE SUNDAY WHEN WEAK S-SW LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS ON BACK SIDE
OF SURFACE RIDGE.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THERE WERE SIGNIFICANT 
MODEL DIFFERENCES IN THE LONG TERM. A MULTI-MODEL BLEND WAS USED TO 
CREATE A SCENARIO WHICH ALLOWS FOR RIDGING AHEAD OF WESTERN STATES 
UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED DRY WEATHER. INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
AHEAD OF TROF PROVIDES MOST PLEASANT ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS THROUGH AT 
LEAST WEDNESDAY. ALONG WITH THE MILDER AIR COMES HIGHER DEWPOINT AIR 
AND A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS IN THE WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN 
AHEAD OF MAIN FRONTAL SYSTEM DUE LATE WEDNESDAY. WITH UNCERTAINTY A 
BIG PLAYER IN THIS FORECAST INCREASED POPS ONLY TO 30 PERCENT FOR 
MUCH OF THE AREA FOR THE FRONTAL PUSH WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND THEN DROP BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR POSSIBLE SLOW SYSTEM 
MOVEMENT/WRAP AROUND EARLY THURSDAY. USED A DRY FORECAST FOR FRIDAY

.DISCUSSION...AIRMASS OVER SW VA AND NE TN SEEMS TO HAVE SATURATED 
ENOUGH TO ALLOW A FEW PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN TO REACH THE SURFACE 
ACROSS MAINLY SWRN VA. TRI REPORTED A BRIEF PERIOD OF VIRGA AND 
LIGHT RAIN. 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS WERE QUITE DRY SO OTHER THAN 
NE TN AND SW VA AREAS...MAY NOT SEE ANYTHING MORE THAN A SPRINKLE 
FROM THIS PASSING SYSTEM TODAY. 14Z TEMPS WERE RUNNING A BIT BEHIND 
FORECAST GRIDS...SO WILL NEED TO MONITOR HOURLY TEMPS AND SEE IF MAX 
TEMPS NEED ADJUSTED DOWN SLIGHTLY.

LOW LEVEL COLD AIR ADVECTION AND LINGERING MOISTURE LOOKS TO KEEP 
AT LEAST SOME DEGREE OF CLOUDINESS OVERNIGHT...BUT ONLY A SPRINKLE 
OR FLURRY (HIGHEST ELEVATIONS) SEEMS POSSIBLE. CURRENT FORECAST 
GRIDS REFLECT THIS VERY WELL.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
238 AM EST FRI NOV 9 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS
A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION...
WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST OVER THE MID MS
RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE
FORECAST AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A FEW SHOWERS POSSIBLE
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE
SWINGS OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. MODELS INDICATE THAT MOISTURE
WILL BE LIMITED AHEAD OF THE FRONT...ESPECIALLY IN THE BOUNDARY
LAYER...SO WILL KEEP POPS LOW ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN
FOR THIS AFTERNOON. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARD THE WARMER
GUIDANCE NUMBERS TODAY WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS EXPECTED...AND WILL GO
WITH A BLEND FOR TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...WARMING TREND IN
THE OFFING WITH TEMPS RISING TO WELL ABOVE CLIMO BY THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK AS HEIGHT RISE IN RESPONSE TO DEPARTING EASTERN CONUS
TROUGH AND ADVANCING UPPER RIDGING FROM THE WEST. SOUTHWEST FLOW
ACCOMPANYING WARMING TREND WILL ALSO BRING INCREASING MOISTURE TO
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SETTING THE STAGE FOR SOMEWHAT
UNSETTLED WEATHER. THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ALONG WITH SEVERAL
MEMBERS OF THE CANADIAN AND GFS ENSEMBLES PROJECT AT LEAST SOME
LIGHT PRECIP PERIODICALLY FOR MOST OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK.
GENERALLY USED GFS GUIDANCE AS BASIS FOR BOTH TEMPS AND POPS AS THE
GFS SEEMS TO REPRESENT A REASONABLE CONSENSUS OF THE OTHER MODELS
AND ENSEMBLES.

.DISCUSSION...
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA OVERNIGHT AS AN UPPER JET OVER
THE NORTHERN PLAINS DIVES SOUTHEAST. MOST OF THE CLOUDS WILL BE IN
THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...AS UPSTREAM LOW LEVEL AIR REMAINS QUITE
DRY. THIS SHOULD PREVENT ANY PRECIP FROM REACHING THE GROUND
OVERNIGHT. UPPER DIFFLUENCE AND VORTICITY ADVECTION SHOULD PROVIDE
SOME ADDITIONAL LIFT FOR LIGHT PRECIP DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY IN
NORTHERN SECTIONS. NO UPDATE IS NEEDED AT THIS TIME.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
253 PM EST THU NOV 8 2007

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WEAK UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM 
SWINGS THROUGH THE REGION ON FRIDAY. THE BIGGEST DISAGREEMENT 
BETWEEN THE MODELS IS THE GFS SHOWING LOW PROBABILITIES ON THE 
FRIDAY SYSTEM WHILE THE NAM SHOWS DRY ON FRIDAY.  BASICALLY BACKED 
OFF ON POPS A LITTLE BUT LEFT THEM IN THE AREAS ALREADY ADVERTISED 
TO HAVE RAIN.  OTHERWISE THE MAIN IMPACT TO THE FORECAST WILL BE IN 
THE WAY OF INCREASED CLOUDINESS.

GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES APPEAR REASONABLE WITH SLIGHTLY 
WARMER TEMPERATURES TONIGHT AND AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT WITH ASSOCIATED 
SLIGHT WARMING FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER HEIGHTS BUILD 
THROUGH THE INITIAL PART OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD KEEPING THE 
FORECAST DRY WITH MILDER TEMPS. PRECIP BACK IN THE FORECAST MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS WITH APPROACH OF 
NEXT UPPER TROF WHICH IS NOT HANDLED SIMILARLY BY MODELS. WENT WITH 
THE 12Z GFS FOR MID WEEK NEXT WEEK WHICH SHOWS MID LATITUDE SYSTEM 
WITH COLD FRONT DEPARTING THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY EVENING 
LEAVING DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MEX MOS 
GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

1030 AM EST THU NOV 8 2007

.DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY WEAKEN ALLOWING CLOUDINESS 
TO SPREAD INTO THE REGION TODAY.  THIS IS REFLECTED NICELY WITH 
CURRENT FORECAST SO NO CHANGES PLANNED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A WEAK DISTURBANCE 
WAS MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE MID MS VALLEY TOWARDS THE OHIO VALLEY 
EARLY THIS MORNING AND BRINGING IN HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE OVER THE TN 
VALLEY INCLUDING THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. THIS WAS HAVING LITTLE EFFECT ON TEMPERATURES WHICH WERE IN 
THE MID 20S TO LOWER 30S. WINDS WERE CALM AS BROAD HIGH PRESSURE 
COVERED THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY. AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE 
EASTERN STATES WAS KEEPING TEMPERATURES COLD ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. THE WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL PASS TO THE NORTH TODAY WITH 
INTERMITTENT MOSTLY HIGH AND POSSIBLY A FEW MID CLOUDS BUT 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM AS SOUTHWEST WINDS DEVELOP WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE SHIFTING EAST. A SECOND SYSTEM A LITTLE STRONGER WILL DROP 
SOUTHEAST OUT OF SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA TONIGHT TOWARDS THE OHIO 
VALLEY AND BRING A FEW SHOWERS TO NE SECTIONS FRIDAY. NOW IT LOOKS 
THAT THE PRECIPITATION WILL START LATER AND TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
WARM ENOUGH THAT IT WILL BE MOSTLY RAIN ALTHOUGH A FEW SNOW SHOWERS 
COULD FALL FRIDAY MORNING IN THE NE TN HIGH MOUNTAINS. HIGHS FRIDAY 
SHOULD BE EVEN A FEW DEGREES WARMER WITH CONTINUED SOUTHWEST WINDS 
AHEAD OF THE WEAK FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS NEXT SYSTEM.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ZONAL-ISH FLOW 
DOMINATES THE AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH SURFACE HIGH COMING IN
FAST AND MOVING OUT BY MONDAY MORNING. H8 WINDS INCREASE
DRAMATICALLY IN ADVANCE OF NEXT FRONT ON TUESDAY WITH POSSIBLE LOW
LEVEL JET AROUND 50 KNOTS. THIS WILL BEAR WATCHING BUT BEST
STREAMLINES APPEAR TO BE COMING FROM THE SOUTHWEST OUT OF DRIER
AIR. MOISTURE WILL PROBABLY BE LIMITED, THEREFORE. AFTER THIS LOW
MOVES OUT LATE WEDNESDAY RIDGE AND DRIER AIR MOVE IN AGAIN. ANY
RAINS WILL NOT BE DROUGHT BUSTERS BUT WE WILL BE THANKFUL FOR
THEM.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE RIDGE TO OUR WEST WILL 
SLIP EAST ACROSS THE REGION OVERNIGHT...AND POSSIBLY END UP ACROSS 
THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY THURSDAY MORNING. THIS WILL SET UP LIGHT

BASED ON THIS SCENARIO...I GENERALLY BLENDED BETWEEN THE NAM-WRF 
MINS AND THE SLIGHTLY COOLER GFS MIN TEMPS. CLOSELY FOLLOWED GFS MOS 
FOR MAX TEMP THURSDAY.

AFTERNOON CUMULUS SHOULD DISSIPATE THIS EVENING...THEN A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS LATE TONIGHT IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT. MID LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD REACH THE REGION BY THU AFTERNOON

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THE POLAR JET WILL BE DIVING SOUTHEAST ON THURSDAY NIGHT...PLACING 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF OUR AREA IN THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF THE JET AND 
500 MB VORTICITY ADVECTION. THE RESULTING LIFT SHOULD BE ADEQUATE TO 
PRODUCE SOME PRECIP IN SW VA/NE TN LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND INTO 
FRIDAY. THE NAM IS A BIT FASTER THAN THE GFS WITH THE SYSTEM...BUT 
OTHERWISE THE MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT. WILL BRING POPS IN AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. THERE COULD BE A BRIEF PERIOD OF SNOW IN ELEVATED 
AREAS...MAINLY ABOVE 2000 FT. DO NOT EXPECT ACCUMULATIONS OF ANY 
SIGNIFICANCE GIVEN WARM GROUND TEMPS. THE JET WILL BE TO OUR EAST BY 
FRIDAY EVENING...ENDING PRECIP CHANCES. A RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD 
OVER THE AREA ON SATURDAY...KEEPING THE WEEKEND DRY.

MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE WITH THEIR DEPICTION OF AN APPROACHING 
LOW/TROUGH FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. THE GFS SHOWS A SPLIT 
STREAM PATTERN WITH A CLOSED LOW FORMING IN THE SOUTHERN 
STREAM...HOLDING OFF PRECIP UNTIL WEDNESDAY. THE ECMWF SHOWS A 
NORTHERN STREAM LOW DIVING SOUTH AND CLOSING OFF OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS...BRINGING PRECIP IN ON MONDAY NIGHT. THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN 
SHOWS AN OPEN TROUGH WITH A POSITIVE TILT. GIVEN THE WIDE SPREAD OF 
THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS AND THUS LOW CONFIDENCE...WILL STICK CLOSER 
TO THE MEAN AND HAVE LOW CHANCE POPS IN ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG COLD FRONT MOVING EAST 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING. PRECIPITATION AND 
CLOUDS MAKING A RAPID EXIT. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN 
THROUGH SHORT TERM WITH DPS FALLING INTO THE 20S. TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE NEARLY STEADY TODAY AND WITH BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS...WIND CHILL
READINGS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 30S AND LOWER 40S FOR MUCH OF THE DAY. 
NEAR FREEZING TEMPS WILL PERSIST ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF 
THE SMOKYS. WENT ABOVE MOS GUIDANCE ON WIND SPEEDS BUT STAYED BELOW 
ADVISORY CRITERIA. WIDESPREAD FREEZE TONIGHT. CONTINUED FREEZE WATCH 
TONIGHT FOR PREVIOUSLY UNFROZEN THIS SEASON SOUTHERN AREAS. UPPER 
LOW OVR GRTLKS PROGGED TO MOVE NE TONIGHT. THIS RESULTS IN ENOUGH OF 
A WESTERLY COMPONENT TO KEEP GREAT LAKES MOISTURE TRAJECTORY TO THE 
NORTH OF MRX CWA. SOME SNOW FLURRIES WILL TEASE WISE AND RUSSELL 
COUNTIES IN SW VA. 
 
.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...TROUGH OVER THE EAST WITH 
RIDGING IN THE WEST CONTINUES WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE COOL WITH HIGHS ABOUT THE SAME AS TUESDAY AND THEN SLIGHTLY 
WARMER THURSDAY. WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL BE JUST AS COLD WITH A HARD 
FREEZE IN ALL LOCATIONS EXCEPT POSSIBLY IN THE KNOXVILLE AND 
CHATTANOOGA URBAN AREAS. A NEW SYSTEM DROPPING SOUTHEAST IN THE NW 
FLOW LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY WILL AFFECT MAINLY THE NORTHERN PART 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. PRECIPITATION MAY BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A FEW 
SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN FOR SNOW AS TROUGH DEEPENS BUT 
WILL KEEP RAIN IN FOR NOW. UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST SATURDAY AND 
TEMPERATURES WILL WARM AS HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST. A WEAK SYSTEM 
SHOULD PASS MAINLY TO THE NORTH SUNDAY AND A STRONGER SYSTEM WILL 
APPROACH BY LATE MONDAY. LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO ADD A CHANCE OF 
RAIN IN MONDAY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
915 PM EST MON NOV 5 2007

.DISCUSSION...A COLD FRONT CURRENTLY LOCATED FROM NEAR LONDON 
KENTUCKY TO NASHVILLE TENNESSEE TO JUST SOUTH OF MEMPHIS IS MOVING 
EAST AT AROUND 40 MILES AN HOUR.  THIS FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT WITH SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS IN 
ADVANCE OF THE FRONT.  TEMPERATURES WILL DROP GENERALLY AROUND 20 
DEGREES FROM MONDAYS TEMPERATURES.  THIS DROP WILL BRING OVERNIGHT 
TEMPERATURES TUESDAY NIGHT-WEDNESDAY MORNING INTO THE LOW 30S AND 
EVEN UPPER 20S IN SOME AREAS OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY 
WHICH WILL BRING THE THREAT OF THE FIRST HARD FREEZE OF THE SEASON 
FOR THESE AREAS.  WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE ISSUED A FREEZE WATCH FOR 
TOMORROW NIGHT.  UPPED PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION SLIGHTLY FOR THE 
PRE-MIDNIGHT PERIOD.  NO OTHER CHANGES.


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...BREEZY AFTERNOON 
ACROSS THE AREA TODAY THREATENING TO SPREAD ANY FIRES THAT START UP. 
GULF MOISTURE NOW FLOWING INTO AREA WITH DEW POINT RISING FROM 30 
DEGREES TO 47 DEGREES IN LAST FOUR HOURS AT KTYS. ALSO SAW AIRCRAFT 
SOUNDINGS FROM KTRI SHOWING DEW POINT AT 1230 UTC WAS -14 DEG 
C...VERSUS +1 DEG C AT 1845 UTC. NOT THAT WILD FIRE THREAT HAS GONE 
AWAY...BUT FIRE BEHAVIOR WONT BE QUITE AS BAD NOW THAT MOISTURE IS 
MOVING IN.  

SHOULD BE WINDY ENOUGH TO WARRANT WIND ADVISORY IN E TN/W NC
MOUNTAINS...AND THINK THIS WILL BE FURTHER ALERT TO FIRE AND
FORESTRY AGENCIES FOR POSSIBLE FAST SPREADING FIRES AT HIGHER
ELEVATIONS.

WITH DEW POINTS RISING...INSTABILITY WILL BE GETTING BETTER FOR
STORMS...BUT THINK THAT TIMING WILL KEEP MOST OF ACTIVITY AS JUST
SHOWERS. FOR QPF...THINK 0.2 TO 0.3 INCH BASIN-AVERAGE AMOUNTS WILL
BE ABOUT IT SINCE MOVEMENT WILL BE PRETTY FAST.

WENT ON WARM SIDE OF GUIDANCE FOR LOWS AND HIGHS THESE TWO PERIODS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AFTER COLD FRONT EXITS
AREA TUESDAY, EXPECT SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT TO STAY A LITTLE
TIGHT UNTIL MIDNIGHT OR SO, PROVIDING SOME BREEZY CONDITIONS INTO
THE NIGHT. BUT WINDS WILL DIE DOWN THROUGH THE NIGHT. STILL, WITH
COLDER AIR AND A LITTLE WIND IT WILL BE THE RAWEST NIGHT OF THE
SEASON SO FAR. SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH
DRIER AND COOLER AIR, BUT THEN ANOTHER WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE NORTH
PORTIONS AND PROVIDES JUST ENOUGH LIFT TO BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS. PREVIOUS PACKAGE HAD DRY WITH A LITTLE DOUBT, AND I HAVE
OPTED TO BRING LOW POPS INTO THE PICTURE LATE THURSDAY AND EARLY
FRIDAY. AFTER THIS ANOTHER DRY PERIOD. TEMPS MORE LIKE SEASONAL.
RAIN AMOUNTS NOT EXPECTED TO BE ANYTHING TO WRITE HOME ABOUT AND
WILL SAY THAT THE DROUGHT WILL CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY WORSEN FOR
ANOTHER WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...
HAVE MADE A FEW UPDATES IN TEMP...DEW POINT...AND RH GRIDS...BUT
VERY FEW CHANGES AFFECT WHAT IS IN THE ZONES. LOOKING CLOSELY AT
FIRE WEATHER SITUATION...WINDS WILL BE PICKING UP THIS AFTERNOON AS
RIDGE SLIDES AWAY TO EAST...BUT PRETTY QUICKLY AFTER WINDS PICK UP
HUMIDITIES WILL BE RISING AS WELL. SOME MOUNTAIN PEAKS MAY GET RED
FLAG CRITERIA BRIEFLY...BUT MOISTURE WILL RUSH IN QUICKLY ENOUGH
THAT THESE CONDITIONS WILL NOT BE PREDOMINANT THIS AFTERNOON. WITH
ON-GOING DROUGHT AND DRY FUELS...CLOSE WATCH SHOULD BE KEPT ON
SITUATION BY FORESTRY AND FIRE FIGHTING AGENCIES...EVEN WITH
HUMIDITY LEVELS RISING.

LOOKING AT THUNDER POTENTIAL...BEST CHANCES AFTER SUNSET THIS
EVENING...MOVING IN FROM NORTHWEST. NIGHT-TIME COOLING WILL BE
TAKING EFFECT BY THEN...THINKING L.I. VALUES WILL PROBABLY ONLY BE
ABOUT -1 TO -2 IN NORTHWEST ZONES...THEN GETS EVEN MORE STABLE
LATER TONIGHT AS PRECIP MOVES FARTHER EAST AND SOUTHEAST. BEST
CHANCES FOR ANYTHING CLOSE TO SEVERE IS STRONG OUTFLOW WINDS BEING
TRANSPORTED DOWNWARD IN RAIN SHAFT...POSSIBLY ONLY FROM A SHOWER
RATHER THAN A THUNDERSTORM.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT) ...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING OVER THE 
AREA WILL SUPPRESS SOUTH TODAY. SW FLOW AND WAA WILL GET UNDERWAY
THIS MORNING AND GET MODERATELY STRONG BY THIS AFTN. WITH MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES...TEMPS WILL RISE >= 30 DEGREES BEFORE SUNSET. STAYED 
CONSERVATIVE WITH MAX TEMPS BUT THESE MAY HAVE TO BE UPPED IN 
MORNING UPDATE. DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER GRTLKS WITH 
STRONG JET CARVING INTO OH RVR VLY THROUGH PERIOD. SIGNIFICANT COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE RAPIDLY SE INTO THE S APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. RIDGING 
TO THE SOUTH HAS GLFMEX PRETTY WELL CUT OFF AND LCH 05/00Z SOUNDING 
SUPPORTS THE LACK OF UPSTREAM MOISTURE. THE MODELS HOWEVER ARE VERY 
AGGRESSIVE IN THETA-E RIDGING WORKING ITS WAY INTO MRX CWA THIS 
EVENING IN ADVANCE OF THE COLD FRONT. INSTABILITY IS ON THE LOW SIDE 
BUT DECENT BULK SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH DEEP JET WILL LIKELY AID 
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT ALONG FRONT. LEFT POPS ON THE HIGH SIDE AND NEAR 
MOS GUIDANCE. PCPN EVENT WILL BE BRIEF WITH FAST MOVING SHOWERS AND 
SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE NOT EXPECTED. WARM SECTOR AND POST 
FRONTAL WINDS WILL BE BREEZY. LAKE WIND OR WIND ADVISORIES MAY BE 
NEEDED TONIGHT FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WIND CHILLS BY DAYBREAK WILL 
BE IN THE 30S MOST AREAS. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE COLD FRONT AND ASSOCIATED 
PRECIP WILL QUICKLY EXIT THE REGION EARLY TUESDAY.  WILL KEEP SOME 
LOW POPS EARLY...THEN DRYING OUT BY AFTERNOON.  WINDS WILL BE BREEZY 
DIRECTLY BEHIND THE FRONT ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON.  ALSO BEHIND THE 
FRONT...A STRONG SURFACE HIGH WILL SLIDE IN PROVIDING A RETURN TO A 
DRY WEATHER PATTERN.  A COUPLE OF LOWS TRACK THROUGH TO OUR NORTH 
DURING THE LATER HALF OF THE EXTENDED.  THESE ARE GENERALLY PROGGED 
TO STAY TO OUR NORTH...ONLY BRINGING US OCCASIONAL BANDS OF CLOUDS.  
WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE TRACK OF THESE LOWS BUT FOR NOW WILL 
CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR THIS PERIOD.  GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
LOOKS GOOD AND DIDN/T STRAY FAR.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LITTLE CHANGE TO CURRENT FORECAST. 
A SHORT WAVE AT 700 MB WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON. A FEW CLOUDS WILL ACCOMPANY THIS FEATURE. A SUBTLE CHANGE 
IN AIRMASS WILL OCCUR AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE 
WEST THROUGH TONIGHT. THIS RESULTS IN SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER 
CONDITIONS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...QUIET WEATHER PATTERN SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY WITH SURFACE HIGH IN CONTROL.  ONLY WEATHER SYSTEM OF 
CONCERN REMAINS WEAK COLD FRONT PROGGED THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO EARLY TUESDAY.  MOISTURE STILL LOOKS TO BE A LIMITING 
FACTOR AND LIFT NOT SIGNIFICANT.  WILL LEAVE 20 TO 30 POPS IN 
FORECAST WITH BEST CHANCES OVER NORTHERN ZONES.  SURFACE HIGH 
REBUILDS IN FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD.  STAYED NEAR

ENSEMBLES ARE COMING INTO SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT WITH TIMING OF 
LATE MONDAY/EARLY TUESDAY EVENT. NOW APPEARS BULK OF THE EVENT WILL 
OCCUR BEFORE 12Z TUESDAY. HOWEVER...STILL DOES NOT APPEAR THIS WILL 
BE VERY SIGNIFICANT AS GOOD MOISTURE FEED REMAINS ABSENT. BALANCE OF 
THE LONG TERM PERIOD WILL BE GENERALLY DRY...ALTHOUGH TEMPS WILL 
FALL TO BELOW CLIMO THROUGH MID WEEK AS AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH DIGS

TIME GETTING THROUGH THE AREA.  FRONT SHOULD BE GONE BY 
TONIGHT...AND EXPECT CLOUDS TO QUICKLY CLEAR OUT NORTH...WHILE SOME 
CLOUDS MAY LINGER A BIT LONGER SOUTH.  EXPECT PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FOR

MINOR TWEAKS.  


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...GENERALLY DRY 
CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD PER 
MEDIUM RANGE MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. THE ONLY POSSIBLE 
EXCEPTION IS THE APPROACH OF A SURFACE COLD FRONT IN THE LATE MONDAY 
INTO TUESDAY TIME FRAME. THIS APPEARS TO BE ANOTHER MOISTURE-STARVED 
EVENT WITH ONLY WIDELY SCATTERED PRECIP EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. THERE 
ARE ALSO TIMING DIFFERENCES...WITH GFS SOMEWHAT MORE PROGRESSIVE 
THAN THE ECMWF OR ENSEMBLE MEAN. HAVE OPTED TO FAVOR THE TIMING OF 
THE ENSEMBLE MEAN WHICH PROJECTS BEST CHANCE MID-DAY TUESDAY. 
GENERAL AGREEMENT AMONG MODELS/ENSEMBLES THAT TROUGH WILL PERSIST IN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
A COLD FRONT IS LOCATED ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TO WEST TN THIS 
MORNING. A RIDGE AXIS EXTENDS FROM NORTHEAST TO SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...PREVENTING ANY DEEP MOISTURE FROM FEEDING 
INTO THE AREA AHEAD OF THE FRONT. WITH MOISTURE CONFINED BELOW 800 
MB...DO NOT EXPECT MEASUREABLE PRECIP. CURRENT FORECAST HAS 
SPRINKLES IN NORTHERN SECTION OF THE AREA...AND WILL LEAVE THIS IN 
THE FORECAST AS RADAR CURRENTLY SHOWS SOME VERY LIGHT RETURNS IN 
CENTRAL KY. WINDS SHIFT TO THE NORTH BEHIND THE FRONT AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA. SKIES SHOULD CLEAR IN THE EVENING AS 
THE 850 MB FRONT PASSES THROUGH. THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE MOVES 
QUICKLY EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES...BUT IS FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER 
HIGH. THIS WILL KEEP CLEAR SKIES AND DRY WEATHER FOR THE AREA 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WITH TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO NORMAL.


.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
AN UPPER TROF MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY WITHOUT
MUCH CONSEQUENCE OTHER THAN A FEW CLOUDS AND A SLIGHT DROP IN MAX
TEMPS. NEXT SHORT WAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES ON
TUESDAY WITH COLD FRONT ADVANCING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA DURING
THE DAY. WENT AHEAD AND INTRODUCED SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING TUESDAY EVENING AS WRAP
AROUND PRECIP DEVELOPS WITH COLDER AIR BUILDING IN ALOFT. DRIER
NORTHWEST FLOW FORMS BEHIND THIS SYSTEM ALLOWING FOR A DRY AND
COOLER WEDNESDAY.

INDICATE A DECREASE IN MOISTURE AS IT MOVES IN AND THROUGH OUR

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A DRY FORECAST
FOR THE ENTIRE PERIOD AS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHEAST AND EAST

HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER DELMARVA WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
CONDITIONS ARE IDEAL FOR RADIATIONAL COOLING THIS MORNING...AND 
EXPECT A SOLID FREEZE IN MUCH OF THE WARNING AREA. THE NPW AND SPS 
WILL BE CONTINUED. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CAROLINAS AND VIRGINIA 
THIS MORNING WILL DRIFT TO THE EAST...WITH A RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING 
SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO A 
SLIGHT WARMING TREND TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. A TROUGH AND UPPER JET 
APPROACH FROM THE WEST...PUSHING A FRONT INTO OUR AREA ON THURSDAY. 
THE RIDGE AXIS TO OUR SOUTH AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL PREVENT ANY 
RETURN OF GULF MOISTURE...AND THE FROPA WILL BE DRY. EXPECT ONLY AN 
INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND A WIND SHIFT WITH THE FRONT. ANOTHER CANADIAN 
HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO BUILD INTO THE AREA ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...
.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
PERIOD CHARACTERIZED BY HARMLESS WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT
COMPLETE WITH A COUPLE OF WEAK IMPULSES. HOWEVER...SOUTHEASTERN
U.S. LOW LEVEL RIDGING KEEPS GULF OF MEXICO SHUT DOWN IN TERMS OF
MOISTURE RETURN AND THEREFORE...POPS BELOW 15 PERCENT. STAYED CLOSE
TO GUIDANCE WHICH DOESNT TREND TOO FAR FROM SEASONAL MAX/MIN TEMPS
FOR THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND APPALACHIAN REGION.

ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID 
MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH COOLER AND DRIER AIR FILTERING INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL THAT THE EARLIER CLOUDS THIS 
MORNING ARE GRADUALLY EVAPORATING THIS AFTERNOON. THIS AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BECOME CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
TONIGHT...WITH EXCELLENT RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS PRODUCING 
THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON. WITH LOW DEWPOINTS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT...IT APPEARS THAT TEMPS WILL FALL TO AROUND FREEZING TOWARDS 
SUNRISE ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS AND 
EXTREME SOUTHWEST NC. THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE FREEZE WARNING IN 
THESE AREAS FOR MONDAY MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE LINGERS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...WITH SUB-FREEZING TEMPS EXPECTED AGAIN ON 
TUESDAY MORNING IN THE WARNED AREA. IN FACT...GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
SUGGEST THAT TEMPS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COLDER ON TUESDAY MORNING. 
WILL NOT PLAN TO ISSUE A FREEZE WATCH FOR TUESDAY MORNING TO AVOID 
ANY CONFUSION WITH THE WARNING FOR TONIGHT. BESIDES...THE GROWING 
SEASON MAY END MONDAY MORNING IN THE WARNED AREA ANYWAYS. WILL PLAN 
TO CONTINUE THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR THE REST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...WHERE TEMPS SHOULD FALL INTO THE 30S ALLOWING 
SCATTERED AREAS OF FROST TO FORM AROUND SUNRISE BOTH MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY MORNINGS. SOUTHERLY FLOW COMMENCES OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON 
TUESDAY...WITH TEMPS QUICKLY WARMING SEVERAL DEGREES ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH

230 PM EDT SAT OCT 27 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE PLAINS...WITH 
A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID WEST. THIS WEAK COLD FRONT SHOULD 
HELP PUSH THE CLOUDS CURRENTLY OVER MIDDLE TN AND SOUTHEAST KY OUT 
OF THE REGION LATER TONIGHT. BEFORE THEN...SOME OF THIS MOISTURE MAY 
MOVE OVER THE VALLEYS LATER THIS EVENING AS DOWNSLOPE FLOW BEGINS TO 
DIMINISH. THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE PLAINS IS PROGGED TO 
BECOME CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY SUNDAY 
NIGHT...WITH GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS PRODUCING THE 
COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON. IT APPEARS THAT A WIDESPREAD FREEZE WILL 
BE POSSIBLE TOWARDS SUNRISE ON MONDAY MORNING ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VA...NORTHEAST TN... THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST 
NC...SO WILL ISSUE A FREEZE WATCH FOR THESE AREAS. WILL ALSO ISSUE A 
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE 
TEMPS SHOULD FALL INTO THE 30S...ALLOWING FOR SCATTERED AREAS OF 
FROST TO FORM AROUND SUNRISE. SIMILAR TEMPS ARE EXPECTED AGAIN ON 
TUESDAY MORNING...BUT WILL NOT EXTEND THE WATCH PAST SUNDAY 
NIGHT/MONDAY MORNING AT THIS TIME TO AVOID ANY CONFUSION. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE FORECAST 
PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL FOR 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. MODEL CONSISTENCY REMAINS POOR BEYOND THAT. 
THERE IS SOME INDICATION A WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL SLIDE 
THROUGH AROUND THE THURSDAY TIME FRAME...BUT MOISTURE/LIFT QUITE 
WEAK SO WILL LEAVE FORECAST DRY THROUGH THE REST OF THE PERIOD.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS YESTERDAYS AREA OF LOW PRESSURE NOW 
IN THE GREAT LAKES REGION...WITH A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE PLAINS EXTENDING INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGES 
REVEAL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDINESS OVER MIDDLE TN BEING 
GENERATED BY A STRONG SHORT WAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THE DEPARTING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES. MESO-WRF MODEL INDICATES THAT 
THE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SHORT WAVE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE 
EASTWARD THIS AFTERNOON...SO WILL PLAN TO INCREASE CLOUD COVER 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FOR THIS AFTERNOON. DOWNSLOPE FLOW OFF OF 
THE PLATEAU SHOULD HELP TO CREATE BREAKS IN THIS CLOUD COVER...SO 
WILL ONLY MENTION PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS THE VALLEY ZONES...AND 
MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES ACROSS THE PLATEAU ZONES WHERE CLOUDS SHOULD 
REMAIN MORE EXTENSIVE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS...WITH AN OCCLUDED FRONT ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF LIGHT RAIN 
CONTINUES ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA AHEAD OF THIS 
OCCLUDED FRONT...WITH THIS AREA OF RAIN SLOWLY MOVING EAST AS THE 
DEEP UPPER LOW OVER CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI DRIFTS EAST. CURRENT WATER 
VAPOR SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A DRY SLOT OVER MIDDLE TN AND MOST 
OF ALABAMA AHEAD OF THIS UPPER LOW. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT THIS DRY SLOT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TOMORROW... 
WITH ONLY A FEW SCATTERED AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN EXPECTED. THIS UPPER 
LOW IS PROGGED TO MEANDER ACROSS THE LOWER AND MID MS RIVER VALLEY 
THROUGH FRIDAY...BEFORE SLOWLY LIFTING NORTH ON FRIDAY NIGHT. THE 
LOCAL ATMOSPHERE APPEARS TO REMAIN STABLE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
PERIOD...SO WILL PLAN TO MENTION LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY THROUGH THE FORECAST 
PERIOD...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN 
WHERE THE OCCLUDED FRONT SHOULD CONTINUE TO RESIDE. AS FOR TEMPS... 
WILL BASICALLY GO WITH A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE THREE SET OF MOS 
GUIDANCE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LOW/TROF CONTINUES 
ITS TREK ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY 
SATURDAY AND MAINTAINED SOME SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWER WITH THE DEPARTING LOW. KEPT THE REMAINDER 
OF THE FORECAST UNEVENTFUL WITH A DRY WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT 
AND SURFACE RIDGING BUILDING SLOWLY SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE REGION. 
STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGHOUT.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A BROAD AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED STRONG UPPER- 
LEVEL LOW CENTERED OVER CENTRAL MISSISSIPPI. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
SEVERAL BANDS OF SHOWERS SLOWLY MOVING EAST ACROSS THE REGION...WITH 
AN ELONGATED SOUTH-TO-NORTH ORIENTED BAND CURRENTLY OVER CENTRAL 
EAST TN. THIS BAND OF SHOWERS SHOULD GRADUALLY MOVE EAST ACROSS MOST 
OF THE NORTHEASTERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHERE 
CATEGORICAL POPS SHOULD SUFFICE FOR THIS AFTERNOON. WILL KEEP POPS 
IN THE LIKELY CATEGORY ACROSS THE CHA AREA...WHERE RAIN WILL LIKELY 
REDEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON AS THE UPPER LOW SLOWLY DRIFTS CLOSER.

316 AM EDT WED OCT 24 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW EXPECTED TO 
CONTINUE AROUND NEARLY STATIONARY UPPER LOW WHICH IS CURRENTLY 
CENTERED OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. UNDERCUT GUIDANCE 
POPS SLIGHTLY IN THE FIRST PERIOD AS FLOW REMAINS GENERALLY 
DOWNSLOPING. AT THE VERY LEAST...PRECIP SHOULD GENERALLY BE ON THE 
LIGHT SIDE ALTHOUGH COVERAGE SHOULD BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY 
CATEGORICAL POPS FOR MOST LOCATIONS. POPS GENERALLY FALL OFF TONIGHT 
AS DRY SLOT ENCOMPASSES MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. FOR 
TEMPS...BUMPED UP GFS GUIDANCE VALUES SLIGHTLY FOR BOTH PERIODS.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY MUCH
CLOSER IN AGREEMENT IN HANDLING THE CLOSED UPPER LOW GENERATING OUR
WET WEATHER...AND ALSO NOT MUCH DEVIATION FROM ENSEMBLES. PREVIOUS
FORECAST GRIDS FOR THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED...
AND STILL (UNFORTUNATELY) SEE OUR RAIN CHANCES DECREASING FOR THESE
PERIODS AS THE UPPER LOW DRIFTS SLIGHTLY W AND NW. SURFACE LOW
DEVELOPMENT STILL LOOKS TO SET UP A SE LOW LEVEL FLOW FROM THURSDAY
INTO FRIDAY...WHICH SHOULD ALSO INHIBIT RAIN CHANCES IN DOWNSLOPE
AREAS. 

OTHERWISE...SOME LINGERING CHANCE POPS INTO SATURDAY AS CLOSED LOW
OPENS UP AND LIFTS NE...FOLLOWED BY A DRY PERIOD FROM SAT NIGHT TO
THE NEW DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY). LOW LEVEL FLOW BEHIND THE EXITING UPPER
LOW/TROUGH FAVORS THE LATEST AND COOLER MOS MAX/MIN TEMPS. THUS...
TEMPS WERE TWEAKED IN LINE WITH 24/00Z GFSX MOS GUIDANCE.

833 PM EDT TUE OCT 23 2007

.DISCUSSION...
SURFACE ANALYSIS...VWP DATA...AND OUR ANEMOMETER INDICATE THAT THE
FRONT HAS JUST PASSED OVER OUR OFFICE. WINDS IN THE ADVISORY AREA
HAVE DECREASED AND SHIFTED TO THE WSW. THUS WILL ALLOW THE WIND
ADVISORY TO EXPIRE AT 9 PM. THE BAND OF RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE
FRONT AS BEEN PRODUCING GENERALLY BETWEEN A QUARTER AND A HALF INCH
OF RAIN...THOUGH ITS INTENSITY HAS BEEN DIMINISHING AS IT MOVES
EAST. AS THE FRONT MOVES AWAY FROM THE UPPER LOW...IT WILL LIKELY
SLOW AND STALL NEAR THE MOUNTAINS. LIGHTER SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE UPPER JET STREAK OVER AL WILL AFFECT SOUTHERN AND WESTERN
PORTIONS OF THE ARA OVERNIGHT. THE MODELS DONT SHOW MUCH STRONG
LIFT OVER THE AREA OVERNIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT...SO EXPECT QPF TO BE
LOW. WILL ADJUST THE POPS TO RAISE THEM IN THE NE AND LOWER
SLIGHTLY IN THE SW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SLUGGISH UPPER LOW AND 
ASSOCIATED MOIST PLUME APPEAR TO BE HEADED EWD NEXT 24 
HOURS...BRINGING HEART OF PLUME THROUGH AREA.  THINKING THAT KCHA 
AREA TO TN/NC/GA BORDER AND POINTS NORTHWARD WILL GET BEST 
RAINS...AS ANY LOCATIONS FARTHER TO THE NORTHEAST WILL HAVE PRECIP 
AMOUNTS CUT DOWN BY HIGH TERRAIN AS THE SOUTHERLY FLOW PASSAGE OVER 
MOUNTAINS.  JUST MARGINAL INSTABILITY AND VERY VERY LITTLE LIGHTNING 
SO FAR...SO HAVE LEFT PRECIP AS SHOWERS FOR THIS EVENING WITH NO 
MENTION OF THUNDER.

FOR WEDNESDAY MOIST AXIS ROTATES INTO NORTHEAST TN...BUT 
ONCE AGAIN LOTS OF MOUNTAINS TO CONTEND WITH...SO JUST GOING WITH 
40-50 PERCENT POPS IN THE NORTHEAST VALLEY.  FARTHER WEST...LOOKS 
LIKE KCHA WILL GET INTO DRY SLOT FOR THE AFTERNOON...SO HAVE CUT 
BACK POPS FOR PM TO JUST SLIGHT CHANCE.  WENT ON HIGH SIDE OF 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS WEDNESDAY FOR NORTHEAST DOWNSLOPE AREAS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FORECAST FOR LONG 
TERM PERIOD STILL HAS VERY HIGH UNCERTAINTY LEVEL. BIGGEST ISSUE IS 
WHERE UPPER LOW ENDS UP BEFORE IT BEGINS TO LIFT OUT.  UNCERTAINTIES 
IN HOW MUCH INTERACTION THERE WILL BE WITH THE NORTHERN STREAM 
CONTINUE...AND MODELS IN POOR AGREEMENT. 12Z NAM A WESTERN 
OUTLIER...WHILE 12Z GFS HAS SHIFTED MUCH FURTHER EAST.  00Z ECMWF 
FAIRLY FAR EAST BUT FARTHER SOUTH...AND OTHER MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
HAVE VARYING SOLUTIONS.  WHERE THIS UPPER LOW SETS UP HAS HUGE 
IMPLICATIONS FOR OUR FORECAST...AND SINCE THERE IS SUCH UNCERTAINTY 
WILL TEND TO BROAD BRUSH THINGS.  SINCE RECENT MODEL TRENDS HAVE 
GENERALLY BEEN EAST...WILL GO WITH A BLEND BUT LEAN CLOSER TO THE 
GFS THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT.  LATEST GFS IS DRYING THINGS OUT QUICKLY 
BY FRIDAY...BUT FOR NOW WILL STAY CLOSER TO CONTINUITY AND THE 00Z 
GFS...KEEPING POPS INTO SATURDAY.  WILL GO DRY FOR SUNDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY.  WILL ADJUST MAV MOS TEMPS UP QUITE A BIT FOR WED NIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...THEN JUST A FEW TWEAKS TO 00Z MEX NUMBERS 
LATER PERIODS.

.DISCUSSION...
PLUME OF MAIN MOISTURE STILL TO THE WEST OF AREA...SO HAVE JUST
LOWERED POPS OVER MUCH OF AREA. FOR THE WESTERN HALF OF THE
AREA...NEEDED TO LEAVE POPS HIGHER DUE TO SMALL AREA OF SHOWERS
HEADED NORTH FROM GA/AL BORDER AND DUE TO FRONT HEADED IN FROM THE
WEST. TIMING OF FINELINE ON RADAR PUTS FRONT AT SOUTHWEST CORNER OF
CWA ABOUT 19Z AND AT KCHA AT ABOUT 21Z. HAVE CHANCE OF THUNDER OVER
WESTERN SECTIONS AS WELL THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO FOCUS ALONG FRONT.

HAVE WARMED UP TEMPS IN EAST AS DOWNSLOPING IS WARMING TEMPS AND
ERODING CLOUD COVER.

353 AM EDT TUE OCT 23 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RAIN AFFECTING MOST OF THE
SOUTHWEST HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...AHEAD OF THE
STILL DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO OUR WEST. DOWNSLOPING SE LOW
LEVEL WINDS KEEPING COVERAGE AND RAIN AMOUNTS DOWN ACROSS NE TN AND
SW VA SO FAR. DID SLIGHTLY RAISE POPS FOR THOSE DOWNSLOPED AREAS
LATER TODAY...TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES GRIDS.

STRONG LOW LEVEL JET AS NOTED ON AVAILABLE OBSERVATIONS AND VAD
WIND PROFILES FROM AREA RADARS...AND PROGGED TO STAY STRONG INTO
THE AFTERNOON PER GFS AND NAM-WRF MODELS. THUS...EXTENDED THE WIND
ADVISORY FOR THE SMOKIES INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. ALSO...INCREASED
WINDS ACROSS THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO 15 TO 25 MPH RANGE.

OTHER CHANGES MADE WERE TO ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS
THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE PLATEAU AREAS AND CHA VICINITY. MAX TEMPS
TODAY NOT LIKELY TO RISE MUCH...EXCEPT FOR DOWNSLOPING AREAS SUCH
AS TRI.

NOT MANY CHANGES NEEDED FOR TONIGHT CONCERNING POPS AND WEATHER...
BUT DID TWEAK MIN TEMPS CLOSER TO A BLEND OF NEW MOS NUMBERS 
(GENERALLY A LITTLE MILDER THAN PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID).


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY 
ASSOCIATED WITH TRACK OF MEANDERING CUT-OFF UPPER LOW OVER THE NEXT 
SEVERAL DAYS. VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE ENSEMBLE MEMBERS KEEP THE CENTER 
OF THE UPPER LOW SOUTHWEST OF THE POSITION DEPICTED BY GFS AND 
FARTHER AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA. THEREFORE...HAVE OPTED TO 
GENERALLY UNDERCUT THE GFS GUIDANCE POPS FOR THE BALANCE OF THE WORK 
WEEK BUT SCATTERED SHOWERS CANT BE RULED OUT. UPPER LOW WILL 
FINALLY PULL OUT BY THIS WEEKEND WITH A SLOW DRYING TREND EXPECTED. 
FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STUCK CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE WHICH KEEPS TEMPS 
CLOSE TO SEASONAL.

337 PM EDT MON OCT 22 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MOIST PLUME NOW ENTRENCHED
OVER AREA BUT MOUNTAINS BLOCKING/FILTERING LOWER LEVEL OF TRANSPORT
MOISTURE OVER EASTERN SECTIONS OF CWA.

MODELS SHOW MOISTURE NOT ALL THAT DEEP DURING THESE TWO 
PERIODS...BUT THERE IS PLENTY OF MOISTURE IN THE LOWER LEVELS AND 
THERE SHOULD BE SLOW INSENTROPIC LIFT AND UPPER DIVERGENCE TO 
PRODUCE SOME UPWARD MOTION.  THINKING OVERNIGHT THAT THERE WILL BE 
ENOUGH SUBTLE LIFT TO SATURATE DEEP ENOUGH TO GET MEASURABLE 
PRECIPITATION FROM A HEAVY DRIZZLE/LIGHT RAIN OVER MUCH OF THE CWA.  
THE NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS WILL HAVE A MORE DIFFICULT TIME GETTING 
MEASURABLE PRECIP DUE TO DISRUPTION TO THIS SETUP BY MOUNTAINS TO 
THE SOUTH.  SO WILL GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS OVER PLATEAU AND SWRN 
HALF OF VALLEY AND TAPER OFF TO NORTHEAST TO CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN IN 
THE NORTHEAST TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  NOT PLANNING ON HIGH QPF NUMBERS 
FOR THESE TWO PERIODS AS MAIN FOCUS APPEARS TO WEST.  

LOOKING AT MANY MODELS...CONSENSUS SHOW A GRADIENT OF HIGH PRECIP 
AMOUNTS WEST VERSUS EAST...AND THE HEAVIEST RAINS STAY TO WEST.  
FORECASTING 2-PERIOD AVERAGE QPF OF ABOUT 1/2 INCH IN WESTERN AREAS 
AND LESS THAN A TENTH OF AN INCH IN EXTREME NORTHEAST.



.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...REASONABLE CONFIDENCE 
IN THE BIG PICTURE...WITH CUT OFF UPPER LOW TO OUR WEST AND 
SOUTHWEST EVENTUALLY LIFTING OUT TO THE NORTH AND NORTHEAST.  
HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE IN THE DETAILS AND TIMING QUITE LOW...WITH 
CONSIDERABLE SPREAD IN THE MODELS AND ENSEMBLES.  LOOKS LIKE UPPER 
LOW WILL BE IN THE ARKLATEX REGION BEFORE LIFTING OUT 
FRIDAY/SATURDAY.  THIS WOULD BRING A FRONT THROUGH HERE AROUND 
THAT TIME FRAME.  UNTIL THEN...NOT IMPRESSED WITH CHANCES FOR MUCH 
SIGNIFICANT PRECIP.  LOOKS LIKE BEST CHANCES WILL BE TUESDAY 
NIGHT...WHEN WILL GO WITH LIKELY POP.  BETTER CHANCES ALSO SHOULD BE 
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN ZONES...AS SOUTHEAST DOWNSLOPE FLOW SHOULD 
LIMIT PRECIP IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEYS FOR LATE WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY. FURTHER OUT...EXACT TIMING OF FRONT PROBLEMATIC. 
FOR NOW WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS FRIDAY AND SLIGHT CHANCE FRIDAY 
NIGHT...THEN DRY SATURDAY.  HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD PROVIDE DRY 
CONDITIONS SUNDAY AND MONDAY.  GFS MOS TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE FOR THE 
MOST PART...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

KNOT UPPER LEVEL WINDS ON BACK SIDE OF ROCKIES/PLAINS DEEPENING 
TROUGH...WHICH TENDS TO SUPPORT FURTHER DEVELOPMENT AND POSSIBLE 
LINGERING OF THE CLOSED LOW WELL TO OUR SOUTHWEST. MOISTURE 
ADVECTION IN ADVANCE OF THIS SYSTEM IS LIKELY...BUT THE DRY AIRMASS 
ACROSS THE REGION SHOULD TAKE LONGER TO REACH SATURATION AND 
EVENTUAL LIGHT PRECIPITATION REACHING THE SURFACE. ISENTROPIC LIFT 
IS NOTED...BUT GENERALLY WEAK WITH CONDENSATION PRESSURE DEFICITS 
REMAINING TOO HIGH FOR SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION UNTIL MAINLY THIS 
EVENING. 

THUS...CONTINUED PREVIOUS TREND OF POPS WELL BELOW MOS GUIDANCE FOR 
TODAY. 22/06Z TEMPS HAD FALLEN WELL BELOW MOS GUIDANCE BUT SHOULD 
LEVEL OUT WITH THE APPROACHING CLOUDS TOWARD DAYBREAK. GENERALLY 
WENT AT OR ABOVE THE WARMER MOS MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY...GIVEN SLOWER 
ONSET OF RAIN/SHOWERS. INSTABILITY LACKING TO SUPPORT THUNDERSTORMS 
FOR TODAY OR TONIGHT. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPMENT...LOCATION... 
AND STRENGTH A BIT UNCERTAIN...SO DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN SPECIFICS. 
THUS...TRENDED WITH GFS MINS ALTHOUGH ALL GUIDANCE MINS SIMILAR IN 
SPITE OF DIFFERING MODEL SOLUTIONS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...CROSS SECTION DATA AND 
SOUNDINGS VERY MOIST TUESDAY AS MOISTURE WITH A STRONG SOUTHWEST

WITH MUCH UNCERTAINTY AS MODELS NOW TRYING TO KEEP UPPER LOW 
SPINNING ACROSS THE CENTRAL STATES FOR A COUPLE DAYS BEFORE MOVING 
IT NE INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND EASTERN CANADA BY THE WEEKEND. LOW 
PRESSURE AREA TUESDAY TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL CAUSE 
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS TO INCREASE. AS COLD FRONT MOVES EAST  
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT THE FRONT WILL LIKELY WEAKEN WITH CLOSED 
LOW TO THE WEST AND THEN BREAK UP WEDNESDAY. HAVE KEPT RAIN CHANCES 
MOSTLY UNCHANGED FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SHOWERS CONTINUEING DEPENDING ON WHERE THE UPPER LOW IS AND THE 
SOUTHERLY FLOW FROM THE GULF ALSO CONTINUEING AS HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
REMAINS OFF THE EAST COAST. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN AFTER UPPER

IN PLACE...TEMPERATURES WILL DROP FAIRLY RAPIDLY AFTER SUNSET.  
HOWEVER...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL SLOW INCREASE FROM SOUTH TO NORTH

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
319 PM EDT SUN OCT 21 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WEAKENS 
SLIGHTLY OVERNIGHT WITH SOME HIGH CLOUDS MOVING INTO THE AREA.
MODELS APPEAR TOO AGGRESSIVE WITH LATE RETURN FLOW. LOW DPS IN 
PLACE SO UNDERCUT MOS MINS. SURFACE RIDGE WILL MOVE ENE ON MONDAY AS 
LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS TO THE SW. LIFT AND INSTABILTY LOOK WEAK. MOS 
POP GUIDANCE HAS BEEN RUNNING HIGH FOR THIS PERIOD BUT HAS BACKED 
OFF ON THE 12Z RUN. CUT BACK ON MON POPS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS THAT DO 
OCCUR SHOULD BE LIGHT. WARM DAY ON TRACK WITH DOWNSLOPING EXPECTED 
...ESPECIALLY ACROSS NE TN VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...DIFFICULT EXTENDED 
FORECAST THIS AFTERNOON DUE TO BIG TIME CHANGE-DISAGREEMENTS IN 00Z 
AND NEW 12Z GFS RUNS AND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN ECMWF AND UKMET. THE 
PREVIOUS GFS AND ECMWF TRACKED THE UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY MID AND LATE WEEK. LOW THICKNESS 
AND 850MB TEMPERATURES SUGGESTED A FAIRLY CHILLY WEEK WITH LIKELY 
RAINFALL THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK.

NEW GFS AND UKMET PAINT A MUCH DIFFERENT PICTURE IN KEEPING THE 
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAIN STATES...THEN LIFTING NORTHEAST
BY LATE WEEK. THE MODELS STILL PAINT DECENT ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE 
AREA FOR LATE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A NORTHERN STREAM WAVE 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST BY MID-WEEK. 
A WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION BY TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY 
WEDNESDAY...WHICH ENDS THE CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION. RIDGING 
RE-ESTABLISHES ITSELF FOR LATE WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY ALLOWING FOR 
WARMER TEMPERATURES TO RETURN. ANOTHER FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
AREA FRIDAY AS SOUTHERN PLAINS UPPER TROUGH LIFTS NORTHEAST.

QUESTION IS...WHICH SOLUTION SEEMS BEST. NCEP IS GOING WITH THE 
UKMET SOLUTION...SO WILL RAISE TEMPERATURES TO MORE OF THE 12 GFS 
SOLUTION AND SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE POPS AND QPF AMOUNTS FOR EARLY AND 
MID WEEK.

SURFACE RIDGING BUILDS IN FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE RIDGE 
ACROSS SW VA...NE TN AND SMOKIES THIS MORNING...WITH LIGHT TO NEAR 
CALM WINDS GENERALLY. LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND 
POSSIBLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. LOWS MOSTLY IN 
THE 40S UNDER CLEAR SKIES AND THESE VERY LIGHT WINDS.

PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY WITH LOW LEVEL WARM ADVECTION AND RISING 
700 TO 500 MB HEIGHTS...BUT UNDERCUT WARMER MOS TEMPS BY A DEGREE OR 
SO...BASED ON GFS MOS PERFORMANCE FOR SATURDAY MAX TEMPS. WENT MORE 
IN LINE WITH GFS MODEL ON HOW FAST CLOUDS MOVE IN (MAINLY VERY LATE 
TONIGHT EVEN FROM THE LESS AMPLIFIED AND FASTER NAM-WRF SOLUTION).
THUS...LOWER ELEVATIONS OF NE AREAS SHOULD SEE COOLER MOS MINS...AND 
GENERALLY A MOS BLEND ELSEWHERE WHERE LARGE DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED 
IN MOS MIN TEMPS. NO POPS NEEDED THROUGH DAYBREAK MONDAY.

LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MAIN STORY THIS WEEK IS STRONG 
SYSTEM THAT MODELS ARE BRINGING DIGGING TROUGH INTO THE PLAINS 
MONDAY AS LARGE HIGH PRESSURE AREA SHIFTS EAST INTO THE ATLANTIC AND 
MOVES SLOWLY EAST. GULF MOISTURE IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE RAPIDLY 
FROM THE SOUTH MONDAY WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT CAUSING RAIN TO DEVELOP 
MONDAY AND SPREAD NE INTO SW VA BY EVENING. THE NAM IS ABOUT 6 HOURS 
FASTER THAN THE GFS AND ECMWF STARTING THE RAIN ABOUT 6 HOURS 
EARLIER. THE GFS IS SLOWER AND CLOSES OFF A MID LEVEL LOW OVER THE 
MS VALLEY TUESDAY WHICH WOULD KEEP THE RAIN AROUND LONGER AS IN THE 
CURRENT FORECAST. THE PRECIPITATION WILL BECOME MORE INTERMITTENT 
BEHIND THE COLD FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT. THE CLOSED MID LEVEL LOW BEHIND 
THE FRONT SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH MOISTURE AND COLD AIR ALOFT FOR SHOWERS 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS IT MOVES SLOWLY EAST AND THEN NORTHEAST 
WITH THE SHOWERS LINGERING THE LONGEST NE SECTIONS. TEMPERATURES 
WILL BE MUCH COOLER MONDAY WITH CLOUD COVER EXCEPT ACROSS THE NE 
WHERE CLOUDS WILL MOVE IN LAST. MONDAY NIGHT CLOUDS AND RAIN WILL 
KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. FOR TUESDAY RAISED 
TEMPERATURES ABOUT 5 DEGREES WHICH WAS SLIGHTLY ABOVE MOST GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS. FOR POPS HAVE CATEGORICAL SOUTH TO CHANCE NORTH MONDAY AS 
RAIN MOVES IN AND THEN LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL THE NEXT THREE PERIODS 
BEFORE LOWERING AFTER FRONT PASSES. HAVE GENERALLY FOLLOWED CLOSE TO 
NEW MOS GUIDANCE AFTER TUESDAY.

MAX TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BUT REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL. SON

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LINGERING MOISTURE FROM AROUND 
850 TO 700 MB LEVELS THIS MORNING HAS KEPT SOME PARTLY TO MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES IN A FEW AREAS. ALSO LIGHT SW TO W WINDS WHICH WERE 
COMBINING TO KEEP MIN TEMPS UP ABOVE MOS GUIDANCE.

THIS MOISTURE IS JUST PASSING ACROSS THE AREA AND WONT BE A FACTOR
FOR LATER TODAY...SO EXPECT MOSTLY SUNNY TO SUNNY SKIES AND
WESTERLY WINDS OF AROUND 5 TO 15 MPH. THIS WOULD SEEM TO FAVOR
GOING WITH THE WARMER MAX TEMPS IN LINE WITH THE GFS MOS NUMBERS.

LIGHTER SURFACE WINDS TONIGHT AND CLEAR SKIES...BUT WEAK SOUTHERLY
FLOW MAY DEVELOP ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND OTHER HIGHER ELEVATIONS
BY 12Z SUNDAY. THUS...TRENDED MIN TEMPS RIGHT IN LINE WITH A MOS
BLEND.


LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...VERY LITTLE TO TALK ABOUT 
DIFFERENT THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST PACKAGE. UPPER RIDGE APPEARS TO 
GIVE WAY TO CUT OFF LOW FORMING OVER LOWER MS VALLEY. LOW THEN 
PROCEEDS TO GO NOWHERE UNTIL ABOUT FRIDAY WHEN IT SHOWS SIGNS OF 
OPENING UP AND MOVING NORTHEAST. BUT THATS ANOTHER STORY. BY MONDAY

POST FRONTAL TROUGH WILL SWING THROUGH THE N PART OF THE MRX CWA 
TONIGHT. STRATO-CU DECK EMBEDDED IN THE TROUGH WILL AFFECT N AREAS

DEEPENS OVER THE PLAINS. CLEAR SKIES ARE EXPECTED THROUGH 
SUNDAY...THEN A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL ADVECT MOISTURE 
INTO THE AREA ON SUNDAY NIGHT. WARM ADVECTION AND DEEP ISENTROPIC 
LIFT MOVE INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...BRINGING CHANCE POPS 
ON MONDAY MORNING. THE TROUGH EVOLVES INTO A CLOSED LOW OVER THE 
MISSOURI VALLEY...AND A DEEP FEED OF GULF MOISTURE WILL OVERRUN A 
WARM FRONT TO OUR SOUTH. BEST DYNAMICS WITH THE UPPER JET REMAIN TO 
OUR WEST AS THE LOW BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY...SO WILL HAVE LIKELY 
POPS WEST. WILL ALSO MENTION ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
IN THE SOUTH AND WEST AS INSTABILITY REMAINS SOUTH WITH THE WARM 
FRONT. MAY SEE A MOUNTAIN SHADOW EFFECT IN SW VA AND NE 
TN...ESPECIALLY AT THE ONSET OF PRECIP ON MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT...SO 
WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS THERE. THE PROGRESSION OF THIS SYSTEM IS 
HIGHLY UNCERTAIN...WITH VARIOUS MODELS SHOWING DIFFERING 
SOLUTIONS...AND HIGH SPREADS AMONG THE ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. THUS 
CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR DAYS 5 THROUGH 7. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE 
RANGE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...THOUGH IF THE GFS IS CORRECT 
THERE WILL BE A ROUND OF STRONG STORMS POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY

A SOLID LINE OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MOVING INTO THE
FORECAST AREA. SPC JUST ISSUED A TORNADO WATCH UNTIL 12Z FOR THE
WESTERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA. CAPES ARE AROUND 1000 J/KG
WITH STRONG WINDS ALOFT PRODUCING A CHANCE OF DAMAGING WINDS.

WCN HAS BEEN ISSUED. UPDATED ZFP OUT SOON.

&&

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MS RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH A LINE OF STRONG CONVECTION DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT 
OVER WEST TN. CURRENT AREA RADARS INDICATE THAT THIS LINE OF 
CONVECTION IS BECOMING MORE SOLID...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
AMPLIFIES OVER THE OZARKS. A STABLE AIR MASS CURRENTLY RESIDES OVER 
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...AND MODELS ALSO INDICATE 
THAT THIS CONVECTION SHOULD WEAKEN OVERNIGHT AS IT MOVES EAST. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE VERTICAL WIND FIELD SHOULD STAY FAIRLY 
STRONG AHEAD OF THE FRONT OVERNIGHT...SO THINK THAT SOME SEVERE 
WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH A FEW STORMS. DAMAGING WINDS APPEAR TO 
BE THE MAIN THREAT...BUT AN ISOLATED TORNADO MAY BE POSSIBLE ACROSS 
THE WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA (MAINLY THE PLATEAU). HAVE 
UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO REFLECT THIS.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
RAISE POPS SOME SINCE THE LINE OF CONVECTION OVER WEST TN APPEARS TO 
BE PRETTY SOLID AT THE MOMENT. SINCE THIS LINE SHOULD WEAKEN AS IT 
MOVES IN THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT...WILL ONLY KEEP POPS IN 
THE SCATTERED CATEGORY.

.DISCUSSION...ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN NEXT WEEK...BUT STILL MINIMAL 
AMOUNTS OF RAIN EXPECTED.  SYSTEM HEADED OUR WAY TONIGHT AND FRIDAY 
LIKELY TO GET PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE OF PRECIP WEST OF AREA 
TONIGHT...BUT AS IT LIMPS IN TO THIS AREA FRIDAY MORNING DURING
COOLEST PART OF THE DAY...FOCUS STARTS TO SHIFT SOUTH AND EAST OF
HERE AS LOW LEVEL FLOW GETS DISRUPTED BY MOUNTAINS. ONLY EXPECTING
ABOUT 2 TENTHS OF AN INCH IN OUR SOUTHWEST AREAS AND LESS FARTHER
TO THE NORTHEAST WEHRE MOUNTAINS HAVE MORE OF AN EFFECT. GOING
BELOW GUIDANCE POPS FOR THE MOST PART WITH THIS SYSTEM.

TIMING OF FRONT LOOKS TO BE NEAR KCHA AROUND 12Z AND NE CORNER OF TN 
BY 00Z...BUT WINDS VEERING AND MOISTURE ERODING DURING THE DAY...SO
THINK ACTIVITY ALONG FRONT WILL BE LESS AND LESS DURING THE DAY IN
OUR AREA...SO ONCE AGAIN POPS/QPF NOT VERY HIGH.

AREA DRIES BACK OUT OVER THE WEEKEND...THEN NEXT SYSTEM DUE TO 
APPROACH AREA HAS ALL KINDS OF ISSUES IN THE MODELS...WITH UPPER TROF
PLACEMENT VARYING BY >1000 MILES BETWEEN GFS AND EURO BY MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK. ALL MODELS DO AGREE ON COLD FRONT WASHING THROUGH
AREA...SO WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO COOL DOWN...BUT NOT AS MUCH AS THE
GFS MOS IS PREDICTING. EXPECTING SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS
AROUND TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE NEAR TUESDAY...THEN DRYING OUT
AGAIN AS FRONT SAGS FARTHER SOUTH LATER IN THE WEEK.

900 PM EDT WED OCT 17 2007

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRENGTHENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT EXTENDING 
EAST ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THETA-E ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT 
THIS WARM FRONT MAY ALSO EXTEND SOUTHEAST INTO CENTRAL EAST TN...BUT 
THE BOUNDARY BECOMES MORE DIFFUSE IN THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION IS CURRENTLY OCCURRING ACROSS THE 
LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY...AND SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST AND 
WEAKEN OVERNIGHT AS IT APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA. A WARM AIR 
ADVECTION PATTERN IS PROGGED TO STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
OVERNIGHT...WITH THE RESULTING ISENTROPIC LIFT HELPING TO MAINTAIN A 
DECENT AREA OF RAIN ACROSS THE AREA. OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST 
LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK IN REGARDS TO POPS AND TEMPS.

HOWEVER...MAIN CONCERN TONIGHT IS WITH THE WIND FORECAST. SOUTHEAST 
850 MB WIND FLOW OVER THE MOUNTAINS...COMBINED WITH A STABLE BOUNDARY 
LAYER EXTENDING ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES...SHOULD HELP TO CREATE 
THE POSSIBILITY OF MOUNTAIN WAVES OVERNIGHT IN THE FOOTHILLS. LOW- 
LEVEL WIND FLOW IS NOT EXPECTED TO BECOME TOO STRONG OVERNIGHT...BUT 
WITH 850 TO 700 MB WINDS AROUND 40 KTS...THINK THAT WIND GUSTS COULD 
EXCEED ADVISORY CRITERIA IN THE FOOTHILLS OF THE MOUNTAINS. THUS... 
WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS ZONES 
INCLUDING THE GREENE COUNTY FOOTHILLS FOR OVERNIGHT AND THURSDAY 
MORNING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE 
DEVELOPED ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AS 
THE ATMOSPHERE HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE IN WESTERN SECTIONS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. WAS NOT EXPECTING MUCH ACTIVITY AS MAIN ENERGY 
WITH WEAK COLD FRONT ALONG THE MS RIVER HAD SHIFTED NORTH INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES TODAY. TEMPERATURES DID WARM INTO THE 
MID 70S TO NEAR 80 AT MOST LOCATIONS...WITH DEW POINTS IN THE UPPER 
50S TO LOWER 60S. THE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE LATE AFTERNOON TO AROUND SUNSET...BUT QUICKLY 
END AS HEATING ENDS. MODELS SHOW DRYING LATER TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
SO ENDED POPS FOR THE LATE NIGHT AND MORNING HOURS. FOR WEDNESDAY 
WEAK RIDGING ALOFT COMES AHEAD OF MUCH STRONGER SYSTEM DEVELOPING 
ACROSS THE PLAINS. THINK MOST OF THE DAY WILL BE DRY BUT SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY MOVING UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST MAY TRIGGER A FEW SHOWERS AND A 
POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORM...MAINLY ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST AND WEST DURING 
THE AFTERNOON. EXPECTING SOUTHWEST WINDS TO WARM TEMPERATURES INTO 
THE LOWER 80S...EVEN WITH FILTERED SUNSHINE ACROSS MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS COULD BE CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS IN SOME PLACES. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH MOVING A WARM FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM STRENGTHENS OVER THE 
UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. SHOWERS SHOULD INCREASE AHEAD OF THIS WARM 
FRONT AS A SHORT WAVE UPPER TROUGH SWINGS OVER THE REGION. THE LONG 
WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS IS PROGGED TO DEEPEN ON 
THURSDAY...AND IS PROGGED TO PUSH A COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA BY THURSDAY NIGHT. MODELS STILL INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT...AS A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL COMBINE WITH A STRONG 
VEERING WIND PROFILE AND STRONG DIFLUENCE ALOFT. THIS COLD FRONT 
SHOULD EXIT THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY MORNING...WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING INTO THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS NOW INDICATE THAT ANOTHER STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY...SO WILL 
INTRODUCE CHANCE POPS FOR THESE TIME PERIODS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE ENSEMBLE MEAN NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD.

AHEAD OF WEAKENING FRONT NEAR THE MS RIVER THIS MORNING. THIS FRONT 
WILL MOVE LITTLE TODAY AS THE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT SHIFTS NORTH SO 
NOT MUCH CHANCE OF SHOWERS TODAY. STILL LOOKS LIKE BEST CHANCE

DISSIPATE BEFORE IT GETS HERE...AS MUCH OF THE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT 
SHIFTS NORTH...SO LOOKS LIKE MINIMAL PRECIP FOR US.  WILL KEEP LOW

LIKELY ERODES THE CLOUDS TOO FAST. SATELLITE AND SOUNDINGS SHOW 
UPSTREAM MOISTURE...AND WITH THE STRONG INVERSION IN PLACE THE 
MOISTURE WILL LIKELY STAY TRAPPED WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS. WILL KEEP 
BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUDS IN THE NORTH OVERNIGHT...WITH SOME 
CLEARING TOWARD SUNRISE. CLOUDS WILL ALSO HOLD TEMPS UP IN THE

STILL SOME POSSIBLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY IN NORTHWEST FLOW AS RIDGING BUILDS 
NORTH. A NEW SYSTEM DEVELOPING IN THE ROCKIES COULD BRING SOME HIGH

A COOL NIGHT BUT SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN TONIGHT. SUNDAY WARMING TREND 
CONTINUES WITH RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS SOUTHEAST. FORECASTING ABOUT A 
5 DEGREE RISE TO MOSTLY 70S. SUNDAY NIGHT SOUTHWEST FLOW WARMS 
NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURES ABOUT 5 DEGREES WITH THE NORMALLY COOLER 
SPOTS AT TRI AND RHP STILL IN THE MID 40S. MONDAY UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING SHIFTS EAST BUT WARM SOUTHWEST FLOW AND DRY AIR STILL IN 
PLACE KEEPING RAIN OUT AND TEMPERATURES WARMING INTO THE UPPER 70S

LATE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY TO THE FORECAST AREA WITH GULF MOISTURE 
SPREADING NORTH AHEAD OF THE FRONT. GFS DRIES AREA OUT WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY WITH WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AND ZONAL FLOW AND THEN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SOME STRATOCU AROUND IN THE LOW 
LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW AND COLD ADVECTION. THIS FLOW IS FORECAST TO 
WEAKEN AND TURN A BIT MORE WESTERLY IN THE SHORT TERM.  EXPECT SOME 
CLOUDS AROUND TODAY...ESPECIALLY NORTH AND MOUNTAINS...BUT EXPECT A 
DIMINISHING TREND LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  TEMPS WILL 
LIKELY DIP INTO THE UPPER 30S IN SOME MOUNTAIN VALLEYS AND NORTHERN 
LOCATIONS TONIGHT...SO WILL KEEP MENTION OF PATCHY FROST.  WILL 
GENERALLY GO A BIT BELOW MAV TEMPS FOR TODAY...WILL STAY CLOSER FOR 
TONIGHT.       

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROF 
GRADUALLY SHIFTS EAST ALLOWING RIDGE TO ADVANCE INTO THE REGION 
DURING THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. THIS WILL ALLOW 
FOR A GRADUAL WARMING TREND BRINGING TEMPS VERY CLOSE TO NORMAL FOR 
MID OCTOBER ON SATURDAY AND THEN FOR THE PERIOD SUNDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY THE MERCURY WILL WARM A GOOD 5 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. 
THE RIDGE GIVES WAY TO AN UPPER TROF TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AND 
RAISED POPS SLIGHTLY FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AS WEAKENING COOL FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. HELD ONTO SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR WEDNESDAY 
AS MODELS STILL INDICATE POSSIBILITY OF A TRAILING WEAK SHORT WAVE 
IN UPPER FLOW WHICH GOES QUICKLY ZONAL OR EVEN SOUTHWESTERLY AHEAD 
OF ANOTHER CENTRAL U.S. TROF AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM POSSIBLY 
ARRIVING BEFORE THE WEEKEND.

TIME...WITH UPSTREAM DEWPOINTS IN THE 30S AND HIGHS IN THE 50S 
ACROSS IL. SURFACE PARCEL TRAJECTORIES ARE FROM THIS AREA...WHERE 
LOWS THIS MORNING WERE IN THE MID 40S. EXPECT SIMILAR LOWS IN OUR

AFTERNOON...ASSOCIATED WITH COLD TEMPS ALOFT WITH AN UPPER CLOSED 
LOW...WILL MOVE INTO NORTHERN SECTIONS TONIGHT. CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE 
TO INCREASE TOMORROW MORNING AS THE CLOSED LOW PASSES TO THE
NORTH...WITH CLOUDS REMAINING MAINLY IN THE NORTHERN HALF. CLOUDS
ARE CONFINED MAINLY TO THE 850-750MB LAYER WITH AN INVERSION
ABOVE...AND SHOULD NOT BE THICK ENOUGH DURING THE DAY FOR ANY
PRECIP. THERE COULD BE A LARGE HIGH TEMP DIFFERENCE FROM NORTH TO

.DISCUSSION...WITH VISIBILITIES REDUCED TO LESS THAN ONE-QUARTER OF 
A MILE AT OAK RIDGE AND TYS...HAVE ISSUED A DENSE FOG ADVISORY FOR 
THE CENTRAL VALLEY.  THE REST OF THE CWA SHOULD BE OK. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATING COLD 
FRONT ACROSS VIRGINIA AND THE CAROLINAS.  MODELS AGREE ON FRONT 
HEADING EAST OUT OF THE REGION TODAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN 
BEHIND IT.  AFTER SOME PATCH FOG EARLY THIS MORNING...SHOULD SEE 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY ALONG WITH DRY AND COOLER WEATHER TODAY AND 
TONIGHT WITH HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL.  THERE WERE SOME DIFFERENCES 
IN THE GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY.  STAYED NEAR TO SLIGHTLY 
BELOW THE MAVMOS NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS ON 
THURSDAY...BRINGING MUCH COLDER AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
TEMPS THAT ARE ACTUALLY A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 
WILL PLAN TO UNDERCUT THE WARM GFS MOS NUMBERS A LITTLE ON THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY...WHICH WILL BE IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE COOLER ETA 
AND NGM MOS NUMBERS. SHORT-RANGE MODELS INDICATE THAT THE BULK OF 
THE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UPPER LOW WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...BUT SINCE STEEP LAPSE RATES ARE EXPECTED...THINK 
THAT A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. HIGH PRESSURE 
THEN BUILDS OVER THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH TEMPS BEGINNING A 
WARMING TREND BY SUNDAY AS WINDS BECOME SOUTHERLY ON THE WESTERN 
SIDE OF THIS HIGH. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES ANOTHER PATTERN 
CHANGE BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...TO MORE OF A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WITH

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATING COLD 
FRONT ACROSS VIRGINIA AND THE CAROLINAS.  MODELS AGREE ON FRONT 
HEADING EAST OUT OF THE REGION TODAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN 
BEHIND IT.  AFTER SOME PATCH FOG EARLY THIS MORNING...SHOULD SEE 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY ALONG WITH DRY AND COOLER WEATHER TODAY AND 
TONIGHT WITH HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL.  THERE WERE SOME DIFFERENCES 
IN THE GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY.  STAYED NEAR TO SLIGHTLY 
BELOW THE MAVMOS NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS ON 
THURSDAY...BRINGING MUCH COLDER AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
TEMPS THAT ARE ACTUALLY A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 
WILL PLAN TO UNDERCUT THE WARM GFS MOS NUMBERS A LITTLE ON THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY...WHICH WILL BE IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE COOLER ETA 
AND NGM MOS NUMBERS. SHORT-RANGE MODELS INDICATE THAT THE BULK OF 
THE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UPPER LOW WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...BUT SINCE STEEP LAPSE RATES ARE EXPECTED...THINK 
THAT A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. HIGH PRESSURE 
THEN BUILDS OVER THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH TEMPS BEGINNING A 
WARMING TREND BY SUNDAY AS WINDS BECOME SOUTHERLY ON THE WESTERN 
SIDE OF THIS HIGH. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES ANOTHER PATTERN 
CHANGE BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...TO MORE OF A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WITH 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEMS AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY AND 
AGAIN BY THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS NEW GFS SOLUTION ALSO HAS SOME SUPPORT

MOISTURE EXPECTED ALONG THIS FRONT...WITH THE GFS MODEL NOW 
INDICATING MORE MOISTURE WITH THIS FRONT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE

WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP THIS 
AFTERNOON...EXPECT SCATTERED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA ALONG THE COLD FRONT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND A 
LITTLE WARMER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND CENTRAL 
EAST TN THIS AFTERNOON...SINCE SOME DOWNSLOPE WARMING MAY OCCUR WITH 
WESTERLY WINDS OFF OF THE PLATEAU. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS INDICATE THE COLD 
FRONT IS EAST OF OUR CWA BY WEDNESDAY SO WILL CONTINUE WITH THE DRY 
FORECAST. MODELS ADVERTISING AN UPPER LOW TRACKING TO THE NORTH OF 
OUR CWA ON THURSDAY. NAM BRINGING MORE MOISTURE INTO OUR AREA THAN 
GFS. WILL FOLLOW THE DRIER GFS AND ADD ONLY 20 POPS FOR NORTHEAST TN 
AND SOUTHWEST VA FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AND KEEP THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...HOT AND DRY WEATHER 
WILL GRADUALLY TRANSITION THROUGH A SMALL CHANCE FOR A FEW RAIN 
DROPS ON TUESDAY BACK TO DRY AND EVER SO SLIGHTLY COOLER THROUGH THE 
SHORT TERM PERIOD. PREFERRED SLIGHTLY WEAKER LOOK TO GFS IN TERMS OF 
THE FROPA FOR TUESDAY. THIS SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE THE ONE THAT TRIED TO 
CREATE A BIT OF RAIN ACROSS THE REGION A COUPLE OF WEEKS AGO BUT HAD 
MAJOR DIFFICULTY DAMPENING THE SOIL. LIFT IS WEAK WITH LITTLE IN THE 
WAY OF CONVERGENCE AND LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. THEREFORE TWEAKED 
POPS BACK SOMEWHAT. WHAT PRECIP OCCURS SHOULD WRAP UP IN MOST AREAS 
DURING THE SECOND PERIOD BUT LINGERED A SLIGHT CHANCE INTO TUESDAY 
NIGHT OVER THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. DRY WEST 
TO NORTHWEST FLOW BUILDS IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM FOR WEDNESDAY. 
CONCERNING TEMPS STAYED A LITTLE ON THE HIGHER SIDE OF GUIDANCE 
BLEND WITH MORE SIGNIFICANT COOLING EXPECTED LATER IN THE WEEK.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
IN FROM THE NORTHWEST AND BECOMES CENTERED NORTH OF THE AREA BY THE
END OF THE PERIOD. UPPER LOW DROPS SE FROM THE GREAT LAKES THU AND FRI.
MODELS NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH STRENGTH AND POSITION OF THIS FEATURE BUT
BEST BET IS ANY CLOUDS AND WEATHER WILL REMAIN NE OF MRX CWA. THE LOW
SHOULD MOVE FARTHER AWAY BY SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH HEIGHTS BUILDING 
ALOFT. OVERALL...DRY AND WARM FORECAST IN STORE.

TOMORROW AT OQT AND TRI. A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE BY MONDAY
AFTERNOON...WHICH MIGHT AFFECT MAX TEMPS BY A DEGREE OR TWO.
OTHERWISE...NO THREAT OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LOW/TROF 
PROGRESSES SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN 
U.S.THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH LITTLE CHANGE FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST.
USED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TOWARD DAYBREAK TUESDAY WITH FRONTAL 
APPROACH WITH SMALL CHANCE POPS FOR THE MAIN EVENT ON TUESDAY. 
MODEL DEPICTION OF INFLOW AND CONVERGENCE STILL MEAGER WITH WEAK 
DYNAMICS SO DIDNT REALLY WANT TO DO ANY MAJOR UPWARD ADJUSTMENT IN 
POPS AT THIS POINT. DRIER AND COOLER AIR FILLS IN BEHIND THIS SYSTEM 
AS UPPER LOW ONLY SLOWLY SHIFTS NORTHEAST THROUGH THE CANADIAN 
MARITIMES.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK FOR TODAY WITH MORE 
DRY AND WARM WEATHER EXPECTED. 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS INDICATE 
A DRIER AIRMASS AND SUPPORT MAX TEMPS FROM THE UPPER 70S TO UPPER 
80S. THESE VALUES SHOULD FALL BELOW RECORD HIGHS...WITH A LITTLE 
BETTER CHANCE TO BREAK THE RECORDS FOR SUNDAY THE 7TH...ESPECIALLY 
AT OQT (85 IN 1997) AND TRI (87 IN 1941).

OTHERWISE...SOME VERY PATCHY LOW CLOUDS AND FOG...BUT THIS IS MAINLY 
TO OUR EAST OVER PARTS OF WRN NC. WILL MONITOR HOURLY TEMPS FOR 
POSSIBLE UDPATE TO FORECAST GRIDS...BUT ZFPMRX SHOULD NOT NEED AN 
UPDATE.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
252 AM EDT SAT OCT 6 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST...WITH A MOIST AND 
UNSEASONABLY WARM AIR MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE THAT THE LOCAL ATMOSPHERE IS MUCH DRIER TODAY (COMPARED TO 
YESTERDAY). WITH A STABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON...THINK 
THERE WILL NOT BE ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE WARMER THAN GUIDANCE TODAY DUE TO AN 
UPPER HIGH BUILDING OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER RIDGE EXPECTED TO PERSIST 
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS THROUGH EARLY WORK WEEK BEFORE DEEP 
TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER THE WESTERN CONUS PROGRESSES EASTWARD INTO THE 
WESTERN GREAT LAKES BY EARLY TUESDAY. THUS STAYED WITH GENERALLY 
PERSISTENT FORECAST THROUGH MONDAY. SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL 
ACCOMPANY UPPER TROUGH AND SWING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION ON TUESDAY. STILL QUITE OF BIT OF DISAGREEMENT AMONG ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS AND GFS WITH TIMING THIS EVENT...WITH VIRTUALLY ALL OF THE 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN THE OPERATIONAL GFS. GIVEN THE 
UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING...GENERALLY KEPT SAME TIMING AS PRECEDING 
FORECAST BUT DID BUMP UP POPS SLIGHTLY. FEATURE STILL NOT REAL 
IMPRESSIVE FROM A PRECIPITATION PERSPECTIVE...BUT EXPECT TO SEE A 
LEAST SCATTERED COVERAGE WITH ITS PASSAGE. UPPER TROUGH BECOMES 
CLOSED CIRCULATION AND DRIFTS SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION BY 
LATE IN THE WORK WEEK RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT HEIGHT FALLS OVER OUR 
AREA. TEMPS ARE PROJECTED TO FALL TO OR EVEN BELOW BELOW CLIMO BY 
LATE IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES 
FAIRLY CLOSELY ON TEMPS.

.DISCUSSION...CLOUDS HAVE DECREASED DRAMATICALLY DURING THE LATE 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING AS DRIER AIR HAS MOVED INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA AS WELL AS DARKNESS ENDING DAYTIME HEATING. SHOWERS HAVE ENDED 
ACROSS THE REGION. THE AIRMASS HAS BECOME MORE STABLE. TEMPERATURES 
ARE MILD WITH READINGS AT 8 PM STILL IN THE 70S TO NEAR 80. 
DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE 60S AND ABOUT WHAT THE CURRENT LOWS ARE 
FORECAST TO BE. AM CONCERNED THAT FOG MAY FORM IN MOST AREAS AS 
TEMPERATURES DROP AND WINDS ARE LIGHT. LATEST MAV GUIDANCE LOOKS TOO 
COOL AND BELIEVE CURRENT LOWS MAY STILL BE A COUPLE DEGREES TOO 
COOL. WILL DROP RAIN CHANCES...TRIM BACK SKY COVER AND RAISE LOWS A 
DEGREE OR TWO SO THAT THEY ARE ABOVE THE CURRENT DEW POINTS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...BREAKS IN CLOUDS HAVE ALLOWED 
AIRMASS TO DESTABILIZE...BUT THUS FAR ONLY SPOTTY SHOWERS HAVE
DEVELOPED THIS AFTERNOON. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE PICS SHOW DRIER AIR
CONTINUING TO WORK INTO THE REGION...SO SHOWERS TONIGHT SHOULD STAY
LIMITED IN COVERAGE. GENERALLY CARRIED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
THROUGHOUT THE EVENING HOURS...AFTER SOME LATE AFTERNOON CHANCE
POPS IN A FEW AREAS. ADDED PATCHY FOG LATE TONIGHT...BUT NOT
COMPLETELY ACROSS ALL AREAS. MOS MINS WERE SEVERAL DEGREES TOO COOL
LAST NIGHT...AND AGAIN LOOK TOO COOL. THUS...I WENT ABOUT 1 TO 2
DEGREES ABOVE THE MILDEST MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT...THAN A LITTLE
CLOSER TO MOS BLEND FOR SAT NIGHT WITH SOME ADDITIONAL DRYING.

WOULD NOT RULE OUT A STRAY SHRA OR TSRA SATURDAY AFTERNOON...BUT NOT
WORTH A MENTION IN THE FORECAST. BASED ON HIGHS TODAY WITH PARTIAL
BREAKS...SEE THE POSSIBILITY OF REACHING NEAR THE WARMER GFS MOS
MAX TEMPS ON BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WITH UPPER RIDGE BUILDING
ACROSS THE REGION...AND ALSO DOWNSLOPE EASTERLY WINDS. OTHERWISE...
DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAR FOR SAT NIGHT AND SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS SLOWLY 
EAST TO THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD BY TUESDAY WHILE UPPER LOW PRESSES 
STEADILY EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON WEDNESDAY AND INTO THE 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. BY FRIDAY. NON-IMPRESSIVE COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AND MAINTAINED THE 
SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS DURING THIS PERIOD FOR A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM. DRIER AND SLIGHTLY COOLER WEATHER EXPECTED BEHIND THE 
FRONT FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO MEX MOS

238 AM EDT FRI OCT 5 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST...WITH EASTERLY FLOW 
BRINGING ATLANTIC MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL AGAIN DEVELOP BY THIS 
AFTERNOON...SO HAVE INCLUDED A MENTION OF TSTORMS AREAWIDE. DEEPEST 
MOISTURE APPEARS TO RESIDE OVER SOUTHEAST TN TODAY...SO WILL GO WITH 
LIKELY POPS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN...WITH LOWER POPS FURTHER NORTHEAST. 
AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARD A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH 
TONIGHT...SINCE THE AIR MASS REALLY SHOULDNT CHANGE MUCH. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE THAT UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT 
FEATURE OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CONUS. THIS PATTERN WILL 
PERSIST UNTIL TUESDAY WHEN A SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED 
SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS 
AND APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. POPS STILL NOT VERY 
IMPRESSIVE AND DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PREVIOUS PACKAGE. 
SOME UNCERTAINTY WITH TIMING THIS EVENT AS BULK OF ENSEMBLE MEMBERS 
DELAY PROGRESSION OF COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA UNTIL WEDNESDAY. 
HEIGHT FALLS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER TROUGH SUGGEST SOMEWHAT COOLER 
TEMPS BY THE LATTER HALF OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK...BUT STILL
ABOVE CLIMO. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE CLOSELY AS THEY SEEM
REASONABLE.

PICS SHOWING AN ASSOCIATED VORTICITY MAX MOVING NORTH JUST ABOUT OUT 
OF THE REGION AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER...ELSEWHERE AREA RADARS SHOW 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUING TO 
RE-DEVELOP AS ABUNDANT MOISTURE TO OUR SOUTHEAST FLOWS INTO THE

SIGNIFICANTLY WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING. KEPT IN SLIGHT CHANCE 
SHOWERS OVERNIGHT IN A FEW AREAS...WITH PATCHY FOG OR DRIZZLE 
WORDING ELSEWHERE. MAX TEMPS HAVE REACHED VERY NEAR FORECASTED 
HIGHS...AND THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER OVERNIGHT WOULD SEEM TO FAVOR 
THE MILDER MIN TEMPS.

DONT EXPECT RAIN CHANCES TO LINGER MUCH BEYOND FRIDAY...WITH
SPOTTY SHOWERS...SPRINKLES OR DRIZZLE IN THE MORNING GIVING WAY TO
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS BY THE AFTERNOON. GFS MOS HIGHS SEEMED
TOO WARM...ALTHO ACTUALLY NOT NEAR RECORD HIGHS ANYWHERE (LOWER 90S)
...SO I FAVORED A MOS BLEND. MOS BLEND PREFERRED FOR FRIDAY NIGHT
ALSO AS SOME CLOUDINESS LINGERS...AND SOMEWHAT OF A BLEND ALSO FOR
SATURDAY MAX TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...BIG RIDGE SHIFTS 
ONLY SLOWLY EAST AS DEEP UPPER LOW MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE GREAT

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
428 AM EDT THU OCT 4 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW PRESSURE AREA AT THE SURFACE
AND ALOFT IN THE GULF CONTINUES TO MOVE SLOWLY NORTHWEST THIS
MORNING. A MOIST SOUTHEAST TO EAST FLOW CONTINUES TO BRING
CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS FROM THE ATLANTIC ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND
WEAK LIFT IS PRODUCING LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS EAST TN AND SW NORTH
CAROLINA. THE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THIS MORNING AND
AFTERNOON AND THEN DECREASE TONIGHT AS THE LOW MOVES FARTHER AWAY.
THE CHANCE OF MEASURABLE RAIN IS GREATEST TO THE SOUTH ALTHOUGH
THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF A TRACE TO A FEW HUNDREDTHS EVEN ACROSS
NORTHEAST TN THIS MORNING AS SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVES
NORTHWEST. TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING ARE VERY MILD FOR THIS TIME OF
YEAR IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S. CLOUD COVER SHOULD HOLD
TEMPERATURES DOWN A FEW DEGREES FROM YESTERDAY BUT STILL BE ABOVE
NORMAL. DOWNSLOPING COULD SCOUR CLOUD COVER OUT OF THE NORTHEAST
AND WARM TEMPERATURES MORE THAN FORECAST LATER TODAY. FOR TONIGHT
SKIES SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY AND TEMPERATURES AGAIN MILD.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THROUGH THE WEEKEND...SURFACE
HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO RIDGE INTO THE AREA FROM THE EAST NORTHEAST.
UPPER RIDGING BUILDS OVERHEAD. MAIN JET POSITIONED WELL TO THE
NORTH. TEMPERATURES REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL. A CUT-OFF LOW WORKS ITS
WAY NORTHEAST THROUGH THE ROCKIES EARLY NEXT WEEK. BY THIS TIME
TEMPERATURES SHOULD RISE TO NEAR RECORD VALUES. CUT-OFF LOW SHOULD
MOVE INTO THE GREAT LAKES BY MID WEEK. A SURFACE COLD FRONT
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST AND MOVES THROUGH THE AREA AROUND
WEDNESDAY BRINGING NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION. &&

.DISCUSSION...WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT OCCURRING BETWEEN THE GULF OF 
MEXICO LOW PRESSURE AREA AND HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE SRN 
APPALACHIANS AND MID ATLANTIC STATES. HOWEVER...DONT EXPECT THIS 
LIGHT PRECIPITATION TO REACH OUR SRN AREAS TODAY. I WILL INCREASE 
CLOUD COVER ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC TO AT LEAST A PARTLY CLOUDY SKY.
MAY ALSO NEED TO MONITOR MAX TEMP FORECAST ACROSS SRN AREAS FOR 
TODAY. 

FOR LATER PERIODS...AGREE THAT AT LEAST SOME SPRINKLES OR CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS MIGHT REACH AS FAR NORTH AS I-40 AREAS...BUT THE EASTERLY 
LOW LEVEL FLOW USUALLY CREATES DOWNSLOPING WHICH HINDERS ANY 
SIGNIFICANT RAINS.

WILL UPDATE ZFPMRX...FORECAST GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS BY 11 AM EDT.

425 AM EDT WED OCT 3 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE HOLDS OVER
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY BUT MOISTURE BEGINS TO INCREASE LATER
TODAY AND TONIGHT FROM THE SOUTH AND EAST AS LOW PRESSURE OVER THE
GULF OF MEXICO MOVES NORTHWEST TOWARDS THE LOUISIANA COAST. COLD
FRONT THAT IS APPROACHING THE OHIO VALLEY WILL BREAK UP AS IT MOVES
INTO THE RIDGE. TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING ARE SEVERAL DEGREES
WARMER THAN TUESDAY MOSTLY IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. HIGHS
SHOULD STILL REACH THE LOWER TO MID 80S EVEN WITH CLOUD COVER
INCREASING ACROSS THE SOUTH AND MOUNTAINS BY THIS AFTERNOON AND
TONIGHT. LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE MILDER WITH CLOUD COVER BUT STILL
GOING A FEW DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE WITH DRY GROUND. NO POPS THROUGH
TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
CONTINUES TO RIDGE INTO THE AREA FROM THE ENE. LOW PRESSURE OVER
THE GLFMEX WITH BROAD MID LEVEL TROUGHING PUMPS MOISTURE INTO
SOUTHERN CWA THURSDAY INTO EARLY FRIDAY. INCREASED CLOUDS S AREAS
AND SCT CU OCCASIONALLY NEAR UPGLIDE AREAS OF NC. GFS MOS POPS
APPEAR WELL OVERDONE DUE TO CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK. WEAK ISENTROPIC
LIFT COULD RESULT IN A FEW SPRINKLES MOST AREAS BUT CONFINED LOW
CONVECTIVE POPS TO S 1/3 OF MRX CWA INTO FRI. A SECOND TROPICAL
WAVE/LOW TRACKS W WELL SOUTH OF AREA OVER THE WEEKEND WITH DRY
CONDITIONS AND HIGH PRESSURE PERSISTING. A BACKDOOR FRONT MAY SNEAK
INTO AREA FROM THE NE BY TUE SO ADDED ISOLD POPS ACROSS SW VA/NE
TN. GFS HAS BEEN HANDLING TEMPS WELL OF LATE AND WITH LITTLE CHANGE
IN AIRMASS STUCK CLOSE TO THOSE NUMBERS.

917 PM EDT TUE OCT 2 2007

.DISCUSSION...
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS FIRM ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. HOWEVER...MOISTURE FROM A TROPICAL SYSTEM OVER THE
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES IS PULLING MOISTURE EAST INTO THE FOOTHILLS
OF THE CAROLINAS AND NORTHERN GEORGIA. LATEST NAMM AND GFS SHOWS
THIS MOISTURE MOVING INTO THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES OF THE FORECAST
AREA OVERNIGHT SO HAVE CHANGED SKY COVER TO PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY
FOR SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE.

MADE SOME MINOR CHANGES TO HOURLY TEMPERATURES TO REFLECT CURRENT CONDITONS.

HAVE A GOOD NIGHT...

&&

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE REMAINS ENTRENCHED 
OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS SUGGESTING MORE OF THE SAME AND THAT A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST IS THE OPTIMUM APPROACH. EASTERLY CIRCULATION 
AROUND DISTURBANCE IN THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO MAY ADVECT ENOUGH 
MOISTURE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TO INCREASE CLOUDS 
SOMEWHAT...BUT OTHERWISE VERY LITTLE CHANGE EXPECTED. MAV TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT THOSE VALUES TO 
ACCOUNT FOR TEMP PERSISTENCE ALSO.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE
CONTINUES TO BE THE DOMINATE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD. SOME
HINT OF TROPICAL MOISTURE WORKING INTO THE REGION AND GFS BRINGING
FAIRLY HIGH POPS IN THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. WITH THE MODELS
TRACK RECORD ON BRINGING IN RAIN WHEN IT DOES NOT RAIN AM HOLDING
OFF ONTO 14 POPS AND KEEPING THE FORECAST DRY THROUGH THE PERIOD.
ECMWF SUPPORTS THIS APPROACH.  

STAYED CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES. DID INCREASE CLOUD
COVERAGE ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY TO REFLECT THE INFLUX OF
MOISTURE.

225 PM EDT SUN SEP 30 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DOMINATE OUR WEATHER IN THE SHORT TERM.  UPPER TROUGH WILL SWING BY 
TO OUR NORTH...AND WEAKENING FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE WEST ON 
MONDAY...BUT THE FRONT WILL DRY UP AND DISSIPATE BEFORE IT MAKES IT 
THIS FAR.  SHOULD SEE JUST A FEW MORE HIGH CLOUDS ON MONDAY.  MAV 
TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...CONTINUATION OF DRY 
WEATHER WITH ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS EXPECTED THROUGH THE LONG TERM AS 
UPPER RIDGE REMAINS ENTRENCHED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. A FEW 
WEAK UPPER WAVES/SURFACE COLD FRONTS WILL APPROACH FROM THE WEST BUT 
WILL HAVE LITTLE SUCCESS IN PENETRATING THE UPPER RIDGE. THE WRF
MODEL PROJECTS MOIST EASTERLY FLOW SETTING UP BY MID WEEK AROUND
DISTURBANCE IN GULF OF MEXICO. HOWEVER...THIS SCENARIO IS NOT
SUPPORTED BY GFS AND WILL BE DISREGARDED FOR NOW. GFS SUGGESTS A
MORE SIGNIFICANT WAVE/FRONT WILL APPROACH BY LATE NEXT
WEEKEND...BUT WILL HAVE TO SEE SOME RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY AND
SUPPORT FROM OTHER MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND ENSEMBLES BEFORE JUMPING
ON THAT EVENT. FOR TEMPS...GFS GUIDANCE APPEARS REASONABLE AND
GENERALLY DID NOT STRAY FAR FROM THOSE VALUES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE IN PLACE 
THROUGH PERIOD, BUT TOWARD END, SAY, LATE MONDAY NIGHT, STRONG VORT 
CENTER MOVES ACROSS LOWER GREAT LAKES, AND SUPPRESSES THE RIDGE DOWN 
TO ABOUT MIDDLE KENTUCKY. WEAK FRONT ATTACHED TO LOW REALLY WEAKENS 
FURTHER SOUTH AND IN DOES NOT REALLY APPEAR TO EVEN MOVE ANY ISOBARS 
AROUND IN TN/VA/NC. THICKNESS VALUES DO NOT APPEAR TO SUPPORT ANY 
REAL COOLING, EITHER. AIRMASS REMAINS DRY AND SO ZERO POPS THROUGH 
PERIOD. PERHAPS SOME INCREASE IN HIGHER LEVEL CU FIELD BY MONDAY 
AFTERNOON. TWEAKED A FEW MAX/MINS FOR THE DIGITAL PRODUCTS BUT THE 
ZONES AND GRAPHICS WILL LIKELY NOT DEPICT MUCH CHANGE IF ANY. WINDS 
SEEMED A LITTLE OFF, EVEN FOR THE RELATIVELY LOW SPEEDS, SO USED GFS 
TO POPULATE THE WIND FIELDS THROUGH THE PERIOD, WITH SOME MINOR 
ADJUSTMENTS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
PATTERN THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUING TO 
DOMINATE.  A COUPLE OF WEAK WAVES/FRONTAL BOUNDARIES TRY TO PUSH 
THROUGH BUT WITH LITTLE SUCCESS.  MAY SEE...AT BEST...A FEW CLOUDS 
AS A RESULT.  THEREFORE...LITTLE TO CHANGE IN CURRENT FORECAST WITH 
CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS AND TEMPS NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD 
OVER THE REGION DURING THE SHORT TERM...WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
EXTENDING IN FROM THE NORTHEAST AND VERY DRY AIR ALREADY IN PLACE.  
SHOULD BE MAINLY CLEAR THROUGH THE PERIOD.  WILL MAKE ONLY A FEW

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE FORESEEN 
IN PERSISTENCE OF UPPER RIDGE REMAINING ANCHORED OVER THE

WAVES/SURFACE COLD FRONTS WILL TRY TO PROGRESS EASTWARD INTO THE 
UPPER RIDGE REGIME...BUT WILL HAVE LITTLE SUCCESS PER MODEL AND

THE BEST APPROACH FOR THE LONG TERM. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH CENTERED NORTH OF US, 
WITH ANTI-CYCLONIC FLOW AROUND IT, CREATING NORTHEASTERLY WINDS AT 
SFC. DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE 30S AND 40S. AUTUMN HAS ARRIVED IN SPADES. 
HAVE DROPPED TEMPS DOWN JUST A BIT, IN LINE WITH BLEND TEMPS BUT 
MODELS NOT FAR OFF EACH OTHER, ANYWAY. WINDS MAY GET A BIT GUSTY 
THIS AFTERNOON, BUT NOTHING SERIOUS. STILL WARM AND VIRTUALLY NO 
CLOUDS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...PERSISTENCE BEST WAY TO GO 
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED WITH HIGH PRESSURE REMAINING IN CONTROL.  A 
COUPLE OF WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARIES DO APPROACH THE AREA...HOWEVER... 
DO NOT EXPECT THEM TO REACH AS FAR SOUTH AS THE MRX CWA AND EXPECT 
THEM TO HAVE VERY LITTLE AFFECT ON AREA WEATHER.  MAIN CONCERN WILL 
BE THE VERY DRY CONDITIONS ON SOME DAYS WITH THE DRIEST LOCATIONS 
HAVING RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES IN THE TEENS AND 20S PERCENT RANGE 
DURING THE HOTTEST PART OF THE DAY.

PERSISTENT RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT. A SERIES 
OF UPPER LEVEL SHORT-WAVES MOVES FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE 
GREAT LAKES EARLY AND MID-WEEK NEXT WEEK FLATTENING THE UPPER RIDGE. 
HOWEVER...ASSOCIATED FRONT HAVE A HARD TIME MOVING INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE RETURN AT BEST. GIVEN ENTRENCHED 
DROUGHT CONDITIONS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...PERSISTENT DRY 
FORECAST SEEMS BEST BET THROUGH FRIDAY.

HAVE TRENDED A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE GFS HIGHS THROUGH THE PERIOD 
GIVEN EXTREMELY DRY SOIL MOISTURE CONDITIONS. PERSISTENT SURFACE 
RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL KEEP DEWPOINTS 
LOW...ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTERNOONS.  THE LOW AFTERNOON

FRONT STILL OFF TO OUR WEST AND NORTHWEST...AND HAVE SEEN SOME 
ISOLATED REDEVELOPMENT OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR TONIGHT AS FRONT MOVES THROUGH...ENDING 
MIDNIGHT OR LATER.  DRIER AND COOLER AIR WILL MOVE IN AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTHWEST FRIDAY...SO SHOULD SEE PLENTY 
OF SUNSHINE ALONG WITH MORE SEASONABLE TEMPS.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE IN THE SHORT TERM...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT
WITH DEVELOPING ANOTHER SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS FOR THIS WEEKEND. A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE TROUGH MOVES
UP AND OVER THE RIDGE FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE GREAT LAKES
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY FLATTENING THE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE FORECAST
AREA...BUT HAS LITTLE EFFECT OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MEAN
1000-500MB RELATIVE HUMIDITY STAYS VERY DRY THROUGH WEDNESDAY SO 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ANTICIPATED. HAVE GONE A COUPLE OF DEGREES WARMER
THAN GUIDANCE HIGHS DUE TO THE ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND EXTREMELY DRY
GROUND.

GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW INCREASING TROPICAL MOISTURE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES BY MID-WEEK NEXT WEEK. BY THURSDAY...THE 
MOISTURE AND ASSOCIATED CLOUDS/PRECIPITATION MOVES INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA. WILL CONTINUE TO MAINTAIN DRY CONDITIONS BUT WILL INCREASE THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
FINALLY A CHANCE FOR SOME RAIN TODAY...BUT IT WONT BE THAT MUCH.
SHORT WAVE EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH FROM THE WEST THIS MORNING. THE
SHORT WAVES ASSOCIATED LIFT IS CAUSING SOME PRECIP THIS MORNING
OVER MIDDLE AND WEST TN. THIS AREA IS EXPECT TO MOVE TOWARD US
TODAY.  

COLD FRONT DUE IN THIS EVENING WITH A LITTLE INSTABILITY. THIS
AFTERNOON, EXPECTING ABOUT 500 J/KG IN NORTHEAST AND NEAR 1000
J/KG IN THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA. HOWEVER, FOCUSING ALONG
FRONT WILL WEAKEN DURING THE DAY AS LEE TROUGH DEVELOPS IN THE
CAROLINAS AND INDUCES MORE OF A PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THERE.

AIR MASS SHOULD DRY OUT VERY QUICKLY IN WAKE OF FRONT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
FEW CHANGES ARE NEEDED THIS PERIOD. SURFACE FRONT WILL BE EAST OF 
THE MOUNTAINS BY 12Z FRIDAY...AND HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE 
AREA. THE RIDGE WILL BE DIRECTLY OVERHEAD ON SUNDAY...THEN SHIFT 
EAST BUT CONTINUE TO EXTEND OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF 
NEXT WEEK. THE GFS BEGINS TO SPREAD SOME TROPICAL MOISTURE INTO THE 
SOUTHEAST ON WEDNESDAY...BUT AT THIS TIME IT WILL REMAIN SOUTH OF 
OUR AREA BEFORE THURSDAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY 
SHOULD BE CLOSE TO NORMAL...WITH A SLIGHT WARMING TREND SUNDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THU)...HAVE HAD A FEW SHOWERS TRYING TO 
GET GOING SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON...AND MAY SEE A FEW MAKE IT DURING 
THE NEXT FEW HOURS.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EARLY TO COVER 
THIS.  UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT WILL PUSH IN ON THURSDAY.  LOOKS 
LIKE WEAK INFLUX OF MOISTURE...ALONG WITH UNIMPRESSIVE 
FORCING...WILL LIMIT PRECIP AMOUNTS.  APPEARS BEST CHANCES FOR 
PRECIP WILL BE IN PLATEAU COUNTIES...AS EXPECT PRECIP TO BE 
DIMINISHING AS IT MOVES IN.  WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS 
PLATEAU...CHANCE ELSEWHERE FOR TOMORROW. WITH SOME CLOUDS 
EXPECTED...AND CURRENT DEWPOINTS GENERALLY IN THE LOWER TO MID 
60S...WILL GENERALLY GO HIGHER THAN MAV TEMPS FOR TONIGHT. NOT MUCH 
ARGUMENT WITH MAV TEMPS FOR TOMORROW.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)
COLD FRONT NOW MOVING INTO OHIO VALLEY WILL MOVE QUICKLY EAST OF
THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY EVENING WITH CLEARING SKIES OVERNIGHT AS
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS. GFS IS FASTER
WITH THE PROCESS THAN THE NAM AND ECMWF WHICH KEEPS THE
PRECIPITATION A FEW MORE HOURS AFTER 00Z. FOLLOWING THIS SYSTEM FOR
THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS IN AT THE
END OF THE WEEK AND THE WEEKEND WHICH CONTINUES THE TREND OF MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES AND ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS
WARM. THE RIDGE IS STRONGEST ON SUNDAY. MODELS DEVELOP AN UPPER LOW
OVER THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL ROCKIES AND BRING IT NORTHEAST ACROSS
THE GREAT LAKES BY MONDAY WHICH NUDGES THE RIDGE NORTH AND EAST.
THE RIDGE KEEPS THE FRONT FROM MOVING VERY FAR EAST OF THE OHIO AND
MS RIVERS BEFORE BREAKING APART MONDAY. THE FORECAST AREA WILL
STILL BE DRY EVEN WITH WEAKER RIDGE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST AND MID
ATLANTIC. BY THE LAST DAY EASTERLY FLOW MAY BRING MOISTURE CLOSE TO
THE FORECAST AREA. GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE HIGHER GUIDANCE VALUES
FOR TEMPERATURES THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. THEN A
PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR THE SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE THAT HAS PERSISTED OVER THE AREA FOR THE PAST SEVERAL 
DAYS FINALLY MOVES EAST TODAY AS AN UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE 
WEST. A PLUME OF MOISTURE SEEN IN WV IMAGERY OVER WEST TN THIS 
MORNING WILL MAKE MORE EASTWARD PROGRESS...INCREASING CLOUD COVER 
AND THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON. A VORT MAX OVER NRN MS IS 
PROGGED BY THE MODELS TO CROSS THE AREA LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND IN 
THE EVENING. INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON LOOKS SUFFICIENT FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS...WITH MLCAPE NEAR 1500 J/KG. WILL CARRY A SLIGHT 
CHANCE DURING THE DAY...INCREASING TO CHANCE POPS NORTH AND WEST 
WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE VORT MAX. TEMPS MAY REACH TO NEAR 90 AGAIN 
IN THE VALLEY. TONIGHT...EXPECT FALLING HEIGHTS AND INCREASING 
MOISTURE AHEAD OF A MORE SIGNIFICANT TROUGH. THE MODELS HAVE SLIGHT 
TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE BEST LIFT...WITH THE NAM BEING ABOUT 3 
HOURS FASTER THAN THE GFS. WILL CONTINUE TO LEAN TOWARD THE SLOWER 
GFS. HOWEVER BOTH SHOW GOOD LIFT AND WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS IN MOST 
SPOTS WITH CATEGORICAL NORTHWEST FOR THURSDAY. INSTABILITY WILL BE 
LIMITED BY CLOUD COVER SO WILL ONLY HAVE A CHANCE OF THUNDER. THE 
UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE IN THE GFS OCCURS AROUND 00Z...AND WILL QUICKLY 
DECREASE POPS THURSDAY NIGHT. SURFACE FROPA OCCURS BETWEEN MIDNIGHT 
AND 10Z. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
HIGHER PRESSURES BUILD OVER THE REGION DEEP INTO THE WEEKEND. 
SUBSIDENCE AND LITTLE IN THE WAY OF MOISTURE ADVECTION KEEPS THIS 
PERIOD OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST UNEVENTFUL. ON MONDAY A WEAK 
SHORTWAVE TRAVERSES THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEASTERN U.S. 
WHILE LOWER PRESSURE MAKES A SLOW MOVE WEST ACROSS THE FLORIDA 
PENINSULA AND SOUTHERN GEORGIA INCREASING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE A BIT 
ACROSS THESE AREAS AND MAY SEE A FEW CU ACROSS SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. BY TUESDAY LOW LEVELS MOISTEN A LITTLE MORE AS 
SUBTROPICAL LOW EDGES SLOWLY WEST ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO BUT ALL 
THIS MEANS FOR NOW WILL BE SCATTERED CU. ADJUSTED MAX/MIN TEMPS 
TOWARD THE NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE WHICH FEATURES ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS 
THROUGH THE FORECAST.

A FEW SHOWERS DEVELOPED LATE THIS AFTERNOON IN THE ERN AND SERN
SECTIONS...BUT HAVE NOW ALL DISSIPATED.  FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
NIGHT...MOST OF THE CLOUDS AND ALL OF THE PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO
STAY WEST. MOIST LAYER IN MODELS AROUND 6000 FEET MAY HELP TO
PRODUCE STRATOCU DECKS OVERNIGHT...EVIDENCE OF THIS ON SATELLITE WITH
PERSISTENT/GROWING LOW CLOUDS PRESENTLY. WITH THIS MOIST LAYER
THINK THAT CHANCES OF FOG ARE REDUCED. ALSO KTRI GFS MOS MINIMUM
TEMP OF 54 SEEMS TOO COLD FOR THIS SCENARIO. BIG PATCH OF STRATOCU
DEVELOPED TOWARD DAYBREAK OVER WESTERN TN THIS MORNING EAST OF THE
CIRRUS FETCH...IF THIS HAPPENS AGAIN COULD PUT BLANKET OF CLOUDS

DEVELOPMENT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
SHIFT TO THE EAST DURING THE SHORT TERM...ALLOWING A COLD FRONT TO 
APPROACH THE AREA.  AHEAD OF THE FRONT...ON WEDNESDAY...WILL SEE 
SCATTERED CU FORM OVER THE AREA...AND BY LATE AFTERNOON...COULD SEE 
SOME ISOLATED...DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION.  HAVE LEFT SOME LOW 
POPS ACROSS THE AREA AFTER 18Z TO COVER THIS POTENTIAL.  
OTHERWISE...IT WILL BE ANOTHER WARM DAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES 
REACHING WELL INTO THE 80S ACROSS MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
WEAK COLD FRONT LOOKS TO PROVIDE THE MAIN RAIN CHANCES...ESPECIALLY 
ON THURSDAY. NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO WITH LIKELY POPS IN ANY AREA 
JUST YET...SO KEPT HIGH CHANCE POPS WITH SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WORDING DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. THREAT OF ANY
PRECIPITATION MAY END AS EARLY AS 06Z FRIDAY.

OTHERWISE...FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD THE SURFACE RIDGING 
HOLDS STRONG AND LIMITS ANY SIGNIFICANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASE. 
UPPER RIDGE ALSO REBUILDS ACROSS THE REGION...UNTIL SHORTWAVE ENERGY 
FAR TO OUR NORTH FLATTENS THE UPPER RIDGE A BIT ON MONDAY...THEN A 
MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE TROUGH BEGINS TO DEVELOP OVER THE NRN AND 
CENTRAL PLAINS ON TUESDAY. HOWEVER...AT THIS POINT PREFERRED TO KEEP 
POPS BELOW 14 PERCENT FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...AND MORE DRY WEATHER. 

THIS ALL RESULTS IN MORE ABOVE CLIMO MIN AND MAX TEMPS THROUGHOUT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
PERSISTENT RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WILL GRADUALLY 
SHIFT TO THE EAST TODAY. TODAY SHOULD BE MUCH LIKE YESTERDAY...WITH 
SCATTERED CU AND TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL. HIGH TEMPS WILL 
FLIRT WITH RECORD HIGHS...WHICH ARE 94/92/90 FOR CHA/TYS/TRI TODAY. 
MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS THE HIGH 
MOVES OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST...AND A MIDLEVEL CAPPING INVERSION 
WEAKENS. THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR ENOUGH DESTABILIZATION FOR ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. THE NAM IS MUCH 
FASTER TO BRING HIGHER POPS INTO THE AREA THAN THE GFS...MAINLY DUE 
TO ITS FASTER EASTWARD PROGRESSION AND WEAKENING OF THE RIDGE. GIVEN 
THE STRENGTH AND PERSISTENCE OF THE RIDGE...WILL LEAN TOWARD THE GFS 
AND KEEP POPS IN THE LOW/SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH WILL PROVIDE 
BETTER LIFT ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY. DYNAMICS WITH THE TROUGH 
ARE NOT IMPRESSIVE...AND THE FLOW OF GULF MOISTURE IS LIMITED...SO 
WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE FOR THURSDAY. STICKING WITH THE 
SLOWER GFS...WILL KEEP SOME POPS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT...TAPERING DOWN 
TO A SLIGHT CHANCE AFTER MIDNIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
COOL FRONT MAKES ITS WAY EAST TO THE ATLANTIC COAST DURING THE DAY 
FRIDAY WITH DRIER NORTHERLY COMPONENT DEVELOPING AS SURFACE RIDGE 
PRESSES ONLY SLOWLY EAST. RIDGING KEEPS THE FORECAST DRY THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND AND BEYOND. GFS CONTINUES TO HINT AT LOW AMPLITUDE SHORT 
WAVE SHIFTING EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. 
ON MONDAY WITH POSSIBILITY OF SURFACE TROF DROPPING SOUTHEAST TOWARD 
THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...PATTERN DOESNT LOOK TOO PROMISING ATTM 
FOR THE INTRODUCTION OF A POP. WILL HOLD ONTO CONTINUITY AT THIS 
EXTENDED PERIOD OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST. TRENDED TEMPERATURE

.DISCUSSION...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SURFACE AND ALOFT REMAINS CENTERED OVER THE
FORECAST AREA SUPPRESSING ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. THE RIDGE WILL 
ALSO KEEP THE TROPICAL MOISTURE OVER THE GULF COAST STATES SOUTH AND 
WEST OF THE REGION PRODUCING ANOTHER QUIET NIGHT OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS.  WILL FOLLOW PERSISTENCE FOR TONIGHTS LOWS. CURRENT
FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AND PLAN NO CHANGES.

HAVE A GOOD NIGHT...

&&

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT IN 
KENTUCKY...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONT IS EXPECTED TO BASICALLY DISSIPATE AS AN 
UPPER-LEVEL HIGH CONTINUES OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
THIS UPPER HIGH SHOULD SUPPRESS ANY POSSIBLE CONVECTION ON MONDAY 
AND TUESDAY AFTERNOONS...AND ALLOW TEMPS TO CONTINUE TO RISE TO 
UNSEASONABLY WARM LEVELS. IN FACT...AFTERNOON MAXES WILL BE 
APPROACHING RECORD-SETTING VALUES. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
CONTINUE WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST...AS THE AIR MASS SHOULD REMAIN 
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THROUGH TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE

KENTUCKY...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONT IS EXPECTED TO BASICALLY DISSIPATE AS AN 
UPPER-LEVEL HIGH CONTINUES OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
THIS UPPER HIGH SHOULD SUPPRESS ANY POSSIBLE CONVECTION ON MONDAY

UNSEASONABLY WARM LEVELS. IN FACT...AFTERNOON MAXES WILL BE 
APPROACHING RECORD-SETTING VALUES. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
CONTINUE WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST...AS THE AIR MASS SHOULD REMAIN 
ESSENTIALLY THE SAME THROUGH TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE REGION DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED. DEEP 
MOISTURE AND SUFFICIENT LIFT SHOULD PRODUCE A DECENT BAND OF

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DIFFERENT DAY, SAME STORY. RIDGE 
ALOFT, GMEX LOW, WHICH DOES NOT AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA AT THIS 
TIME. MAIN PROBLEM IS HOW MUCH TO TWEAK TEMPERATURES SO I TWEAKED 
HIGHS TODAY UP JUST A HAIR WITH SUNSHINE ABUNDANT FOR THE LAST 
SEVERAL DAYS. 


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS CONSISTENT IN SHOWING
UPPER RIDGE MAIN FEATURE AS GULF OF MEXICO LOW DRIFTS WEST INTO SRN
PLAINS AND LOWER MISS VALLEY. SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW GRADUALLY
DEVELOPS BY MONDAY...AND LONG RANGE MODELS AGREE ON SOME OF THIS
GULF MOISTURE FINALLY ADVECTING INTO THE REGION BY TUESDAY. UPPER
RIDGE GIVES WAY TO POSSIBLE WEAK SHORT WAVES BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON
INTO WEDNESDAY...THUS I ADDED LOW POPS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND
SLIGHTLY INCREASED POPS TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. NOT CONFIDENT
ENOUGH TO GO WITH CHANCE POPS YET...SO JUST NUDGED POPS UP TO
BETTER MESH WITH ADJACENT FORECAST GRIDS. 

OTHERWISE...TWEAKED MAX AND MIN TEMPS IN LINE WITH LATEST GFS AND
GFSX MOS GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING ALONG THE APPALACHIANS...WITH 
A COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS ONLY 
EXPECTED TO MOVE AS FAR SOUTH AS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY 
THURSDAY...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS ZONAL. AS A RESULT...DRY 
AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH 
BASICALLY JUST A TEMP FORECAST. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND 
TOWARD PERSISTENCE WITH MAXES...ALTHOUGH WITH A SLIGHT INCREASE EACH 
SUCCESSIVE DAY. WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE MINS EACH MORNING AS WINDS 
BECOME MORE SOUTHERLY BY THURSDAY NIGHT...AND ADVECT MORE MOISTURE 
AND HIGHER DEWPOINTS INTO THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...RIDGING DOMINATES THE 
SCENE THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND SLIGHTLY BEYOND PARKING OVER THE 
REGION KEEPING AN EASTERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW IN PLACE ACROSS THE 
APPALACHIANS AND THE STORM TRACK OVER NORTHWESTERN AND NORTHERN 
PLAINS STATES. BY TUESDAY ATMOSPHERE BEGINS TO MOISTEN A BIT AHEAD 
OF GREAT LAKES SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM. FRONT 
APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND ADDED SLIGHT 
CHANCE SHRA/TSRA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. CONFIDENCE 
NOT HIGH THAT RIDGING WILL BREAK DOWN THIS QUICKLY...THEREFORE THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITIES. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WARM, DRY. RIDGE PERSISTS WITH 
FLORIDA LOW INTENSIFYING SLIGHTLY AND MOVING A TAD WEST. SURFACE 
HIGH KEEPS DRY FLOW OF AIR FROM NORTHEAST US INTO AREA. ADJUSTED 
TEMPS CLOSER TO BLEND. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAINLY A PERIOD OF UPPER
RIDGE DOMINATING AND LOW PRESSURE MOVING WEST ACROSS GULF COAST
REGION. UPPER RIDGE LOSES SOME AMPLIFICATION AND LOW LEVEL FLOW
CHANGES DIRECTION...FROM WEAK EASTERLY TO SOUTHERLY BY LATE THIS
WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER...SEE NO REASON TO ADD ANY
LOW POPS FOR THIS PACKAGE...AS A DRY FORECAST SEEMS ON TRACK WITH
HIGHS MOSTLY IN THE 80S AND LOWS IN THE MID 50S TO MID 60S. A BIT
OF CLOUDINESS AND THE SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WOULD FAVOR THE
MILDEST MIN TEMPS WHERE MOS DIFFERS SLIGHTLY...AND STAYED VERY NEAR
TO THE LATEST GFS/GFSX MOS FOR MAX TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE 
REGION BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.  SATELLITE 
INDICATING A FEW CUMULUS CLOUDS DEVELOPING ALONG THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS WHICH SHOULD DISSIPATE THIS EVENING.  SHOULD HAVE A CLEAR 
TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKY FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.  MAVMOS TEMPERATURES 
LOOKED FAIRLY REASONABLE...SO DIDNT STRAY TOO FAR. 

.LONG TERM...(WED NIGHT THROUGH TUE)...APPEARS RIDGE WILL CONTINUE 
TO PROVIDE DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAR WEATHER THROUGH THURSDAY.  
CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH IN THE LONGER TERM.  12Z GFS HAS MADE A 
CONTINUITY BREAK...AND NOW BRINGS A BAND OF MOISTURE UP ACROSS THE 
AREA BY THE WEEKEND AS LOW MOVES NORTHWEST ACROSS NORTHERN GULF AND 
ONSHORE WEST OF THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER.  IT THEN KEEPS CONSIDERABLE 
MOISTURE OVER THE AREA INTO THE EARLY PART OF THE WEEK.  EVEN IF 
CORRECT...PRECIP WOULD PROBABLY BE LIMITED...BUT CLOUDS WOULD BE 
ENHANCED CONSIDERABLY.  WILL NOT JUMP ON THIS SOLUTION YET WITH JUST 
ONE MODEL RUN...BUT IF THIS TREND CONTINUES LATER SHIFTS WILL HAVE 
TO MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO LATER PERIODS OF FORECAST.  FOR NOW 
WILL GO MORE WITH MORE OF A 00Z ECMWF/06Z GFS BLEND.  THIS HAS 
BETTER  CONTINUITY AND AGREES WITH HPC GUIDANCE IN KEEPING FORECAST 
DRY.

ACROSS FL PENINSULA TO ATLANTIC AND THEN UP COAST JUST ENOUGH TO 
CYCLONICLY ROTATE RH INTO THE REGION, WITH LOW POPS ACROSS 
MOUNTAINS. THIS IS THE ONLY MODEL DOING THIS. GFS BUILDS UPPER RIDGE 
OVER US, AND ALLOWS GMEX LOW TO RETROGRADE WESTWARD, KEEPING RIDGE 
EVEN STRONGER. PATTERN TEMPORARILY TAKES ON OMEGA BLOCK 
CHARACTERISTICS. BELIEVE THIS IS MORE LIKELY WHAT WILL HAPPEN AND SO 
HAVE KEPT POPS OUT OF THE ENTIRE LONG TERM PACKAGE. HAVE ADJUSTED

BLENDS.

LOOKS MORE REASONABLE. OTHER MODEL DIFFERENCES EXIST HANDLING ENERGY 
IN THE NORTHERN STREAM IN THE LATER PERIODS...BUT SHOULD  NOT MATTER

1020 AM EDT SUN SEP 16 2007

.DISCUSSION...SOME CLOUDINESS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE 
WILL SWING THROUGH THE AREA LATER TODAY BUT BASICALLY NO IMPACT ON 
THE FORECAST.  CURRENT FORECAST ON TRACK SO NO CHANGES PLANNED.


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A FALL LIKE MORNING 
NOTED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH TEMPS IN THE 40S TO MID 50S.  
WARM AIR ADVECTION TO OUR NORTHWEST AND UPPER JET AXIS HAS BEEN 
PRODUCING SOME MID TO HIGH CLOUDS OVER IL/IN AND ERN KY.  THESE 
CLOUDS SHOULD AFFECT AT LEAST NRN MOST AREAS IN OUR REGION THIS 
MORNING...SO SKY COVER GRIDS INCREASED SLIGHTLY FOR TODAY.

EXPECT THE MID TO HIGH CLOUDS TO BE GONE OR THINNED OUT TONIGHT...SO
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES LOOKS GOOD. GFS MAX TEMPS WERE RIGHT ON FOR MAXES 
YESTERDAY...AND CLOSELY FOLLOWED FOR HIGHS TODAY.  BLEND FOR MINS 
TONIGHT WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES NOTED.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE
EXPANDS OVER EASTERN US MONDAY WITH THICKNESSES INCREASING.
HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL WARM ABOUT 5 DEGREES WITH LOWS A FEW DEGREES
WARMER ALSO. THE RIDGE STAYS STRETCHED FROM THE NORTHEAST SOUTHWEST 
TO THE CENTRAL GULF COAST THROUGH WEDNESDAY. ON WEDNESDAY THE LONG 
RANGE GFS BRINGS A NEWLY FORMED CUT OFF LOW FROM FLORIDA WEST TOWARD 
THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF BY THE WEEKEND. THIS WOULD BRING MOISTURE 
NORTH IN THE FORM OF CLOUDS THURSDAY AND A CHANCE OF RAIN FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY. PREFER ECMWF MODEL WHICH KEEPS BULK OF THE MOISTURE SOUTH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA AND RIDGE STRONG THROUGH SATURDAY. INCREASING 
CLOUD COVER THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH WARMER NIGHT TIME TEMPERATURES 
AS SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE MOVES UP FROM THE SOUTH.

.DISCUSSION...REMNANTS FROM HUMBERTO MOVING SLOWLY ENEWD NEAR CENTRAL
MS/AL BORDER. COUPLE OF LARGE SHIELDS OF RAIN TO NORTHEAST OF
HUMBERTO THAT STRETCH THROUGH AND PAST OUR CWA. NORTHERN EDGE OF
HUMBERTO SHIELD IN SOUTHERN TN SLIDING TO THE ENE. LOOKING AT
PRESENT MOVEMENT AND MODEL TRENDS THINK IT IS SAFE TO BACK OFF POPS
SOMEWHAT IN THE NW CORNER OF CWA FOR THE REST OF AFTERNOON. HAVE
BACKED POPS TO 40 PERCENT IN THAT CORNER. ELSEWHERE HIGH POPS RULE
WITH 100 PERCENT POPS FOR ABOUT THE SOUTHERN 20 PERCENT OF THE AREA
AND 80+ PERCENT POPS FOR ABOUT THE SOUTHEASTERN 1/2 OF AREA.

MODELS SHOW HUMBERTO CENTER CONTINUING TO WEAKEN AND TURN ALMOST
DUE EAST...AND NCEP FORECASTER STATED AN EXPECTED LESSENING FROM
THE OVERNIGHT RAIN RATES NORTHEAST OF HUMBERTO. SO HAVE KEPT QPF
VALUES FAIRLY CONSERVATIVE...WITH BASIN-AVERAGE AMOUNTS AROUND 0.50
INCH ALONG THE GA BORDER. WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED BY SOME 1-3 INCH
ISOLATED AMOUNTS...BUT THINK THAT PRIME FOCUS OF HEAVY RAIN WILL BE
SOUTH OF ARE TODAY AND SOUTHEAST OF AREA TONIGHT.

06Z GFS MOVEMENT OF BACK EDGE OF RAIN IS WAY TOO FAST...NAM AND RUC
LOOK MUCH MORE REASONABLE. PURE RADAR EXTRAPOLATION PUTS BACK EDGE
OF PRECIP AT KCHA ABOUT 530 PM...AT KTYS AT 800 PM...CORNER OF SE
TN 700 PM...AND NE CORNER OF TN AT 100 AM. THINK ENTIRE SHIELD WILL
SHIFT EASTWARD AND ACCELERATE THE BACK EDGE A LITTLE FASTER THAN
THESE ESTIMATES...ESPECIALLY FOR THE 100 AM ESTIMATE FOR NE CORNER
OF TN.

COLD FRONT STILL PRETTY FAR NORTHWEST AND WILL NOT AFFECT WEATHER
FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

CURRENT TEMPS IN FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON LOOK VERY GOOD.

CLEARING BEHIND PASSAGE OF STRONGER COLD FRONT. GFS MOS MAXES AND

313 PM EDT THU SEP 13 2007

...SHORT-TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...THE REMAINS OF HUMBERTO
WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYER IN THE WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THE
NEXT 24-36 HOURS. MODELS SHOW THE MAIN EFFECTS FROM HUMBERTO WILL
BE SOUTH AND WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA.  A STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS 
THE GULF COAST STATES WILL KEEP BEST LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SOUTH OF THE
REGION WITH STRONGEST CONVECTION FROM HUMBERTO MAINLY SOUTH. 
HOWEVER...ENOUGH SYNOPTIC SCALE FORCING FROM ISENTROPIC LIFT...
DIVERGENCE ALOFT FROM RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF JET...TROPICAL 
MOISTURE...LIMITED INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS WITH 
EMBEDDED STORMS. 

A NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL PULL A
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT WITH DRIER AIR AND SLIGHTLY
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR THE WEEKEND.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS INDICATE A COLD 
FRONT ALONG WITH ITS ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH WILL PUSH QUICKLY EAST 
OF OUR CWA ON EARLY SATURDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN BEHIND 
IT.  WILL KEEP ONLY LOW POPS FOR THE MOUNTAINS FOR SATURDAY MORNING 
THEN DRY ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA BY AFTERNOON.  GFS INDICATING AN 
INVERTED TROUGH PUSHING INTO THE AREA ON SUNDAY...BUT WITH ONLY 
LIMITED MOISTURE AVAILABLE...WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY.  UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDS IN ON MONDAY BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY.  GFS INDICATING A DISTURBANCE MOVING UP FROM THE SOUTH ON 
THURSDAY.  WITH STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ON MOVEMENT...WILL KEEP 
THURSDAY DRY FOR NOW.  STAYED NEAR GFS/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

TROPICAL STORM HUMBERTO CONTINUES TO MOVE SLOWLY NORTH ACROSS
LOUISIANA THIS MORNING. PLENTY OF TROPICAL MOISTURE IS SPREADING
NORTHEAST ALOFT WITH A GOOD DEAL OF CI/CS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.
BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS ARE BECOMING MORE EASTERLY ACROSS THE
CAROLINAS AND WILL SPREAD MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY BACK INTO THE
EASTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. LATEST RUC AND NMM SHOWS
SUFFICIENT CAPE FOR WIDELY SCATTERED DEVELOP OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HAVE INCLUDED A 20 POP FOR THE EASTERN
MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

LATEST NMM CONTINUES TO SHOW PRECIPITATION FROM THE REMAINS OF
HUMBERTO MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY.
WILL ADDRESS THE POTENTIAL OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS THIS AFTERNOON.

HAVE A GOOD DAY...

NOT EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE MRX CWA...AND HAVE LEFT MENTION OF POPS 
OUT OF MORNING FORECAST.  SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO BE THE

AND WARM CONDITIONS IN THE FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  FOR 
TONIGHT...REMNANTS OF HUMBERTO WILL BE APPROACHING THE AREA.  THERE 
REMAINS SOME QUESTIONS AS TO TIMING AND NORTHERN EXTENT OF HUMBERTO 
AND HAVE CONTINUED WITH THE IDEA IN THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WITH 
SLOWLY INCREASING SKY COVER AND POPS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH THROUGHOUT THE 
NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...REMAINS OF TROPICAL STORM 
HUMBERTO SHOULD SPREAD RAINS ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON 
FRIDAY BRINGING MUCH NEEDED RAIN.  STILL ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY TO KEEP 
POPS BELOW THE CATEGORICAL RANGE BUT IN THE HIGH LIKELY CATEGORY.  
TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN MODERATE...MUCH COOLER THAN PREVIOUS

.SHORT-TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...INTERESTING FORECAST FOR
THE NEXT TWO DAYS AS A TROPICAL SYSTEM...CURRENTLY JUST OFF THE COAST
OF TEXAS (NEAR THE GALVESTON AREA)...MOVES SLOWLY NORTHEAST THE
NEXT 24-48 HOURS. A FRONT OVER THE GULF COASTS STATES WILL REMAIN
NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH FRIDAY. TROPICAL MOISTURE WILL ADVECT NORTHEAST
TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND FRIDAY. HAVE TRENDED FORECAST TOWARD THE GFS SOLUTION DUE TO
BETTER CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS RUN AND ECMWF AND UKMET. ALSO...PER
NCEP DISCUSSION SEEMS TO HAVE A BETTER HANDLE OF CURRENT CONDITIONS.

GFS SHOWS SURFACE RIDING OVER THE AREA WEAKENING THURSDAY GIVING WAY 
TO INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT ABOVE STATIONARY FRONT FOR THURSDAY 
NIGHT. MODELS SHOW A SERIES OF 60-70 KNOT 300MB JETS MOVING ACROSS 
THE OHIO VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY PLACING THE FORECAST AREA 
UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT REAR ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET. THE DIRECT 
CIRCULATION ENHANCES FRONTOGENETIC LIFT OVER THE REGION FOR FRIDAY.

HAVE TRENDED POPS LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY TOWARD THE GFS 
SOLUTION. SINCE BEST LOW LEVEL FORCING WILL BE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...I DO NOT EXPECT RAINFALL TO BECOME TOO HEAVY.

HAVE ALSO TRENDED TOWARD THE GFS TEMPERATURE SOLUTION AS WELL.

.LONG-TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT SHOULD BE 
MOVING THROUGH THE AREA DURING FIRST PART OF PERIOD...MARGINAL 
INSTABIITY AT BEST IN AREA...BUT WILL LEAVE THUNDER IN FORECAST FOR 
NOW FOR FRIDAY EVENING.  PRECIP SHOULD BE SHUTTING DOWN PRETTY 
QUICKLY FRIDAY NIGHT...EXCEPT FOR SOME UPSLOPE PRECIP IN THE HIGHER 
MOUNTAINS.  HAVE ALL POPS GONE BY DAYBREAK SATURDAY AND DONT RETURN 
FOR BALANCE OF FORECAST.  

AFTER THE FRONT PASSES THE RIDGE OVER W TX SHOULD BUILD THIS WAY FOR 
THE NEXT FEW DAYS...BUT IT FORECAST TO STAY SLIGHTLY W OR SW OF 
US...RESULTING IN A NWLY UPPER LEVEL FLOW.  AIR MASS LOOKS TOO DRY 
FOR ANY PRECIP...BUT SEVERAL AFTERNOONS SHOULD SEE GOOD GRADIENT 
NE-SW OF CLOUD COVER AS WEAK SHORT WAVES RACE THROUGH BACK SIDE OF 
GREAT LAKES TROUGH.

ALTHOUGH MODELS HAVE BEEN COOL FOR PAST SEVERAL MONTHS...WENT 
SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN MOS GUIDANCE FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...THINKING 
THAT GROUND WILL BE PRETTY WELL SOAKED FROM FRIDAY RAINS...FROM 
WHICH EVAPORATION WILL EAT UP A LOT OF ENERGY.  SLOWLY WARMING 
THINGS UP AT THE FIRST OF THE WEEK...BUT BACK-DOOR FRONT LOOKS TO 
SURGE DOWN EAST OF THE APPS.  ALSO...NEED TO WATCH TO SEE IF SYSTEM 
OFF CAROLINA/GA COASTS DOES INDEED DEVELOP AS FORECAST BY GFS/DGEX.

AMOUNTS OF A THIRD TO OVER ONE INCH HAVE OCCURRED ACROSS THE CWA

LOCATIONS AT MID AFTERNOON IN THE UPPER 60S AND LOWER 70S. MODELS 
END RAIN SHORTLY AFTER 00Z AS FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE WHOLE FORECAST 
AREA. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD SE FROM THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH SKIES CLEARING. BECAUSE OF THE RAINFALL TODAY ADDED 
PATCHY FOG TO ALL ZONES FOR LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. LOWS 
TONIGHT WILL BE MUCH COOLER IN THE MID 50S TO MID 60S. FOLLOWED THE

315 PM EDT MON SEP 10 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS COVERED 
THE REGION THIS MORNING BUT THE CLOUDS BROKE LATE THIS MORNING 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA AND TEMPERATURES SHOT UP INTO THE MID 80S TO 
LOWER 90S. CONVECTION DEVELOPED ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU EARLY 
THIS AFTERNOON WHERE DIFFERENTIAL HEATING WAS STRONGEST AND THIS 
ACTIVITY HAS BEEN MOVING STEADILY NORTHEAST. OTHER SHOWERS ARE 
STARTING TO DEVELOP IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY. A WEAK COLD 
FRONT/BOUNDARY WAS LOCATED OVER THE OHIO VALLEY IN NORTHERN KY AND 
EXTENDED SOUTHWEST INTO AR. THE BEST INSTABILITY IS ALONG AND SOUTH 
OF THE FRONT WITH LIS FROM -2 TO -4. THE FORECAST AREA IS ALONG THE 
SOUTHERN EDGE OF THIS INSTABILITY AXIS THIS AFTERNOON. DEW POINTS 
ARE IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S A FEW DEGREES HIGHER THAN SUNDAYS. THIS 
FRONT WILL SAG SLOWLY SOUTH TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. MAIN SHORTWAVE WILL 
MOVE THE FRONT SOUTH OF THE AREA BY TUESDAY EVENING. HAVE HIGHEST 
POPS NW SECTIONS LATE TODAY AND EARLY EVENING AND THEN EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS TUESDAY AFTERNOON AHEAD OF FRONT. WENT ABOUT 10 PERCENT 
BELOW THE AVERAGE 60 TO 70 POPS PRODUCED BY THE MODEL DUE TO THE 
ONGOING DROUGHT AND CONVECTIVE NATURE OF THE PRECIPITATION. LOWERED 
POPS TONIGHT ABOUT 10 PERCENT BUT COVERAGE MAY BE VERY LOW AFTER 
SUNSET BEFORE PICKING UP AGAIN TUESDAY MORNING. LOWS TONIGHT SHOULD 
AGAIN BE VERY WARM NEAR THE NAM GUIDANCE AROUND 70. HIGHS TUESDAY I 
AM EXPECTING WILL BE ONLY IN THE 80S UNLIKE TODAY WITH NO SUN.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH PUSHING THE COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
TUESDAY EVENING...AS A UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD ACROSS THE REGION ON 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMING ZONAL. 
THIS ZONAL UPPER FLOW SHOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF COOLER AIR THAT 
REACHES THE FORECAST AREA...WITH TEMPS ONLY EXPECTED TO COOL-DOWN A 
FEW DEGREES. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE FORECAST 
AREA ON FRIDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION AND ANOTHER 
SLIGHT COOL-DOWN FOR THE WEEKEND. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS AGAIN 
ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE WARMER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED...WHICH HAS BEEN THE VERIFYING TREND OF LATE.

WAVE ENERGY STAYS TO THE NORTHWEST DURING THE DAY WITH MORE 
SIGNIFICANT FRONT APPROACHING TONIGHT. THINK NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW

EAST. TEMPERATURES ARE VERY MILD THIS MORNING SO HAVE ADJUSTED 
TEMPERATURES UP A COUPLE DEGREES IN THE HOURLY GRIDS. CLOUD COVER 
SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES COOLER TODAY ALTHOUGH BREAKS IN THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE 
AREA...HARD TO CALL IT A FRONT.  MORE SIGNIFICANT FRONT TO APPROACH 
LATER TONIGHT.  MODELS SOMEWHAT BULLISH ON PRECIP FOR THE SHORT 
TERM...BUT MODELS ALSO INDICATE THERE SHOULD BE CONSIDERABLE PRECIP 
TO OUR WEST RIGHT NOW WHICH IS NOT HAPPENING.  NOT IMPRESSED WITH 
FORCING...AND GIVEN POOR INITIALIZATION COMBINED WITH FACT THAT WE 
ARE IN A DROUGHT WILL GENERALLY UNDERCUT MOS POPS AND KEEP THINGS IN 
THE CHANCE CATEGORY. SHOULD BE QUITE A BIT OF CLOUDS AROUND...SO 
TEMPS SHOULD BE A BIT LOWER THAN RECENT DAYS.  WILL GENERALLY STAY 
CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MIDWEST COLD FRONT BUILDS 
SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA ON TUESDAY AND USED A GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE FROPA DROPPING BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE FROM 
NORTH TO SOUTH AS BOUNDARY PROGRESSES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. 
BASICALLY STAYED WITH A DRY DAYTIME PERIOD WEDNESDAY BUT ADJUSTED 
PROBABILITIES BACK INTO THE CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT FROM SOUTH TO NORTH AS 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY RIDES NORTHEAST FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
TOWARD THE MID SOUTH. ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPS NORTH OF THE OLD 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY DURING THIS PERIOD AWAITING ARRIVAL OF YET ANOTHER 
COLD FRONT FRIDAY NIGHT. STAYED WITH LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES 
THROUGH THIS PERIOD ADJUSTING TO SLIGHT CHANCE ON SATURDAY FOR 
POSSIBLE SLOWER FRONTAL MOVEMENT. FINALLY BACK TO A DRY FORECAST 
SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND 
SURFACE RIDGING BUILDS IN BEHIND FRONT. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR THE LONG TERM FORECAST.

PERSISTENT RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IS FINALLY GIVING 
WAY...AND A TROUGH OVER WEST TN IS BEGINNING TO MOVE TO THE EAST. 
SOME SHOWERS ARE NOW MOVING THROUGH THE PLATEAU COUNTIES...AND WILL 
CARRY CHANCE POPS THERE. WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP DOWN INTO THE 
VALLEY. HOWEVER THE LIFT REMAINS WEAK AND EXPECT DECREASING COVERAGE 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. ON MONDAY THE TROUGH BECOMES ORIENTED MORE EAST-WEST 
ACROSS THE AREA. CONVERGENCE AT 850 AND 700 MB WILL LIKELY PRODUCE 
BROKEN CLOUD COVER AND SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON. NAM 
GIVES LIKELY POPS...BUT AM NOT CONVINCED THAT THE LIFT WILL BE 
ENOUGH FOR THAT MUCH COVERAGE...SO WILL GO WITH CHANCE POPS FOR 
MONDAY. CLOUDS SHOULD ALSO HOLD TEMPS BACK FROM WHAT THEY HAVE BEEN

AND MAY NOT BE MORE THAN ONE INCH IN MOST PLACES FOR THE TWO DAYS.
GFS TRIES TO BRING DRIER AIRMASS WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT

1009 AM EDT SUN SEP 9 2007

.DISCUSSION...
AREA RAOBS AND ACARS SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THERE IS A TRANSITION
ZONE OVER EAST TN FROM DEEP MOISTURE TO THE WEST TO A DRY AIR MASS
TO THE SOUTH AND EAST. PW FROM 12Z OHX SOUNDING WAS OVER 2
INCHES...WHILE RNK WAS WELL UNDER 1 INCH. WITH THE 850 MB RIDGE
OVERHEAD...THE PRECIP IN MIDDLE TN WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE EASTWARD.
EXPECT THAT THE RIDGE WILL BREAK DOWN THROUGH THE DAY AND ALLOW THE
MOISTURE TO MOVE INTO THE AREA LATE. THE NAM SHOWS SOME SHOWERS
DEVELOPING OVER THE PLATEAU BETWEEN 18Z AND 21Z...BUT THIS APPEARS
OVERDONE GIVEN THE DRY AIR OVER THE AREA AND THE STABILITY IN AREA
SOUNDINGS. THE PLATEAU COUNTIES COULD SEE AN ISOLATED SHOWER LATE
THIS AFTERNOON...SO THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR THAT AREA SEEMS
WARRANTED. CURRENT HIGH TEMP FORECAST IN THE 85 TO 90 RANGE LOOKS
GOOD...AS CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE THROUGH THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SHORTWAVE TROF WILL DROP 
SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE WESTERN CANADIAN PROVINCES AND HELP TO PUSH A 
COOL FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY. THE FRONT MAKES 
PROGRESS JUST SOUTH OF THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY BUT THE UPPER LEVEL 
FLOW BECOMES PARALLEL TO THE BOUNDARY FAIRLY QUICKLY AND IMPULSES

355 AM EDT FRI SEP 7 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...APPEARS UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN 
CENTERED TO OUR EAST IN THE SHORT TERM.  HIGH CLOUDINESS OVER THE 
AREA IS SLOWLY SHIFTING EAST.  EXPECT THIS HIGH CLOUDINESS TO 
GRADUALLY DIMINISH ACROSS THE AREA TODAY.  LOOKS LIKE MAINLY DRY 
CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE...AS INSTABILITY MINIMAL.  SHOULD BE MOSTLY 
CLEAR TONIGHT.  WILL MAKE A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS...BUT LOOK 
REASONABLE OVERALL.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN BELT OF WESTERLIES 
REMAINS NORTH OF THE AREA WITH SHORT WAVES PASSING THROUGH THE 
MIDWEST AND NORTHEASTERN U.S. OVER THE WEEKEND. WENT AHEAD AND 
DROPPED TERRAIN POPS FOR SATURDAY AND TRIMMED BACK POPS ACROSS MOST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR SUNDAY LEAVING A SLIGHT CHANCE ON THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WHERE TERRAIN AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER INSTABILITY IN 
THIS REGION MAY LEAD TO ISOLATED CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON. 
STAYED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE ON MONDAY AND USED LOW 
CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AS GFS INDICATES A 
SLOW FRONTAL MOVEMENT INTO THE REGION BY TUESDAY NIGHT. FRONT CLEARS 
THE APPALACHIANS BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND DROPPED POPS GRADUALLY FROM 
WEST TO EAST WITH FRONTAL MOVEMENT. MAINTAINED DRY FORECAST FOR 
THURSDAY WITH TEMPERATURES CLOSER TO NORMAL FOR EARLY SEPTEMBER.

WAVE TO THE NW CONTINUES TO LIFT MID LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. 
SOME VIRGA SHOWING UP ON RADAR BUT LOW LEVELS REMAIN VERY DRY. CLOUDS 
WILL LIKELY THIN SLOWLY OVERNIGHT ENOUGH TO ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP TO 
FCST MINS LATE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
PATTERN IS EXPECTED OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE CAROLINAS AND 
VIRGINIA...THOUGH IT DOES BECOME MORE SW-NE ORIENTED. THIS RIDGE 
WILL PREVENT THE EASTWARD PROGRESS OF AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE MID 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND WE SHOULD ONLY SEE HIGH TO MIDLEVEL CLOUDS 
AS A RESULT. LIKE TODAY...THE CLOUDS SHOULD BE THICKEST IN WESTERN 
PORTIONS OF OUR AREA. TEMPERATURES HAVE CONTINUED TO VERIFY HIGHER 
THAN MOS...SO WILL GO A BIT HIGHER THAN GUIDANCE ON TONIGHTS LOWS 
AND FRIDAYS HIGHS.

LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE ACROSS THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND EASTERN TN VALLEY 
GETS SQUEEZED BY COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND 
TROPICAL/SUB TROPICAL SYSTEM OFF THE CAROLINA COAST THIS WEEKEND. 
NAM/WRF BRINGS THE SYSTEM IN AROUND MYRTLE BEACH BY SUNDAY EVENING 
WITH THE GFS FARTHER NORTH ALONG THE OUTER BANKS. EITHER SCENARIO 
WILL KEEP COLD FRONT TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST THIS WEEKEND. GFS 
INCREASES MOISTURE ESPECIALLY OVER WESTERN SECTIONS BY SUNDAY AND 
THERE COULD BE ENOUGH LIFT FOR ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
NAM/WRF BRINGS MOISTURE FARTHER EAST WITH TROPICAL SYSTEM SUNDAY 
EVENING BUT STILL DRIER AIR ACROSS FORECAST AREA AND COLD FRONT TOO 
FAR WEST AND NORTHWEST. NOT VERY CONFIDENT THAT THERE WILL BE 
CONVECTION SUNDAY OR MONDAY BUT WILL KEEP LOW POPS IN FOR NOW. MAIN 
CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AFTER POTENTIAL 
TROPICAL SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEAST AND FRONT APPROACHES. FOLLOWING 
PERSISTENCE SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY FOR HIGHS AND LOWS WITH HIGHS

BROKEN HIGH CLOUDS ARE STREAMING ACROSS EAST TN THIS MORNING AHEAD
OF AN UPPER LOW OVER MISSOURI. A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE LOCATED
OVER THE CAROLINAS AND VIRGINIA WILL DIRECT THIS LOW TOWARD THE
NORTH-NORTHEAST...KEEPING OUR AREA DRY. WILL UPDATE TO INCREASE THE
CLOUD COVER SLIGHTLY...AS PARTLY SUNNY WORDING IS MORE APPROPRIATE
FOR MOST OF THE AREA. CURRENT OBSERVED TEMPS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE REGION 
WILL BRING ANOTHER WARM AND DRY TODAY.  SATELLITE SHOWING SOME HIGH 
CLOUDS TRACKING THROUGH THE AREA ASSOCIATED WITH A SHORTWAVE.  BEST  
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY REMAINS TO THE WEST OF OUR CWA...SO WILL 
KEEP THE FORECAST DRY FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.  CLOUDS SHOULD BE THIN 
ENOUGH NOT TO AFFECT TEMPERATURES TOO MUCH.  STAYED ABOVE GFS MOS 
GUIDANCE AGAIN FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LATEST MODEL RUNS CONTINUE 
TO INDICATE THAT WARM AND DRY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...WITH A POSSIBLE PATTERN CHANGE BY TUESDAY. IN ADDITION...A 
LOW PRESSURE AREA OFF THE CAROLINA COAST IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY 
DEVELOP INTO A TROPICAL SYSTEM AND SLOWLY APPROACH THE OUTER BANKS 
OF NC ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. RIGHT NOW...THE MODEL CONSENSUS IS FOR 
THIS SYSTEM TO REMAIN EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A WEAK COLD 
FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BECOMING QUASI-STATIONARY BEFORE 
REACHING THE FORECAST AREA. THIS SCENARIO...UNFORTUNATELY...KEEPS 
THE FORECAST AREA DRY UNTIL TUESDAY...WHEN AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS 
PROGGED TO AMPLIFY OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY AND PUSH A STRONGER COLD 
FRONT INTO THE REGION. WILL PLAN TO KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE 
FORECAST FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME RAIN FROM THE TROPICAL SYSTEM OVER THE CAROLINAS. WILL GO WITH 
HIGHER POPS ON TUESDAY...WITH THE PASSAGE OF A STRONGER COLD FRONT 
EXPECTED. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS SEEM TO BE TOO LOW 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WHICH HAS BEEN THE VERIFYING TREND OF LATE. 
ALTHOUGH THE UPPER HIGH BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN ON FRIDAY...THE LOCAL 
AIR MASS DOESNT REALLY CHANGE MUCH...WITH MOISTURE ONLY SLOWLY 
INCREASING. THUS...WILL LOWER MAXES AND RAISE MINS SOME EACH DAY 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND TO ACCOUNT FOR AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN CLOUD 
COVER...BUT OVERALL...WILL KEEP TEMPS WARMER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD. TEMPS SHOULD COOL BY 
TUESDAY AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION...BUT WILL NOT 
COOL TEMPS AS MUCH AS THE GFS GUIDANCE...SINCE THE GFS HAS BEEN TOO 
AGGRESSIVE LATELY WITH COOL-DOWNS BEHIND THE COLD FRONTS.

HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE AREA TODAY WILL SHIFT SLIGHTLY TO THE 
EAST TOMORROW. CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH A MIDLEVEL DEFORMATION ZONE 
OVER MIDDLE TN TODAY WILL ALSO BEGIN TO MOVE EASTWARD...AND MAY 
BRING PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES TO WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA LATE 
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. DO NOT EXPECT THAT THE CLOUDS WILL BE AS 
OVERCAST TOMORROW AS THEY HAVE BEEN TODAY. THE EAST SHOULD STAY 
MOSTLY CLEAR. DO NOT EXPECT THE LIFT OR MOISTURE TO BE ENOUGH TO 
PRODUCE ANY PRECIPITATION. MOS GUIDANCE HAS VERIFIED TOO WARM WITH 
LOW TEMPS AND TOO COOL WITH HIGH TEMPS LATELY...SO WILL ADJUST FROM 
MOS ACCORDINGLY. 

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...PATTERN EXPECTED TO 
SLOWLY CHANGE WITH RIDGE BREAKING DOWN AND LARGE TROUGH SLIDING INTO 
AREA.  OTHER PLAYER IS THE LOW PRESSURE AREA ABT 500 MILES EAST OF 
JACKSONVILLE.  THIS AREA HAS BEEN DRIFTING EASTWARD FOR THE PAST 
COUPLE OF DAYS...BUT ALL MODELS TURN IT BACK TO THE U.S. OVER THE 
WEEKEND.  STILL LOOKS LIKE THIS SYSTEM OFFERS NO RELIEF TO DRY 
CONDITIONS AS IT STAYS TOO FAR EAST BEFORE RE-CURVING TO THE NORTH 
ALONG THE COAST.

COLD FRONT SHOULD SIFT THROUGH AREA SUNDAY OR MONDAY AND SETTLE A 
COUPLE 100 MILES TO THE SOUTH.  EXPECTING LOW POPS IN AREA WITH 
FROPA AS MUCH OF THE MOISTURE WILL BE BROUGHT INTO THE TROPICAL 
SYSTEM ALONG THE EAST COAST.  MODELS DIVERGE STRONGLY AROUND TUESDAY 
WITH GFS BRINGING STRONG FRONT AND PRECIP TO AREA...WHILE OTHER 
MODELS LEAVE OLD FRONT SOUTH OF THE AREA AND NEXT WAVE/FRONT STILL 
IN PLAINS.  WITH GFS THE OUTLIER AND ITS LOSING THE OLD FRONT...HAVE 
OPTED AWAY FROM GFS...AND WILL KEEP ONLY LOW POPS IN AREA...WITH A 
GRADIENT FROM SOUTH TO NORTH.

FOR TEMPS...STAYING ABOVE GUIDANCE ON HIGH TEMPS PRE-FROPA...AND 
HAVE GONE A LITTLE BELOW GUIDANCE ON MINS POST-FROPA.  DEWPOINT/RH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...RIDGE SHIFTS VERY SLOWLY 
EAST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM KEEPING THE FORECAST AREA DRY. 
CONVECTION SHOULD REMAIN SUPPRESSED WITH DRY LOW LEVEL AIRMASS. WILL 
PROBABLY NOT EVEN SEE FORMATION IN THE MAJOR TERRAIN AREAS. TRIED TO 
INDICATE INCREASE IN HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE FROM HENRIETTE BUT STILL 
BANKING ON A MOSTLY SUNNY FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM. TEMP FORECAST 
A LITTLE TRICKY WITH LOW DEWPOINT AIR BUILDING INTO THE REGION. 
GUIDANCE WAS WAY OFF FOR TODAYS MORNING LOWS MOST AREAS. DECIDED TO 
STAY CLOSER TO THE MET MOS FOR MIN TEMPS WHILE HOLDING CLOSE TO A 
GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAXES. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...PATTERN SLOWLY 
CHANGING DURING THIS PERIOD AS RIDGE OVER MOST OF U.S. NOW WILL BE 
REPLACED BY TROUGH MOVING THROUGH MIDDLE OF NATION.  ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT EXPECTED TO PASS THROUGH REGION AROUND MONDAY.  LOW PRESSURE 
AREA OFF FLA COAST NOW MOVING AWAY FROM COAST IS EXPECT TO MOVE BACK 
TOWARD COAST IN A FEW DAYS.  ITS PRESENT LOCATION AND EXPECTED PATH 
DOESNT FAVOR BRINGING ANY MEANINGFUL PRECIP TO THE AREA...BUT IT 
COULD PLAY A ROLE IN TIMING OF COLD FRONT...COULD POSSIBLY 
ACCELERATE ITS PASSAGE.  

THINK BEST CHANCES OF PRECIP LOOK TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH 
FROPA...OTHERWISE CONTINUED MOSTLY DRY.

FOR HIGH TEMPS...HAVE GENERALLY GONE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE GUIDANCE ON 
WARMEST DAYS...BASED ON MODEL BIASES RECENTLY.  AFTER FROPA...HAVE

305 AM EDT TUE SEP 4 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEAST...WITH A LOW PRESSURE AREA 
OFF THE COAST OF GA AND SC. MODELS INDICATE THAT A DRIER AND MORE 
STABLE AIR MASS (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TODAY. IN ADDITION...AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH IS PROGGED TO 
BUILD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY THIS AFTERNOON. THIS UPPER 
HIGH SHOULD COMBINE WITH THE VERY DRY AIR MASS TO WARM TEMPS A 
LITTLE MORE THAN YESTERDAY...WITH NO CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT 
EXPECTED. WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARD PERSISTENCE WITH MINS TONIGHT... 
BUT A FEW DEGREES LOWER THAN THIS MORNING SINCE DEWPOINTS ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE A LITTLE LOWER TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS AREA 
BRINGING DRY CONDITIONS ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY. A WEAK SHORTWAVE ROTATES OVER THE RIDGE ON THURSDAY. DEEPEST 
MOISTURE REMAINS TO THE WEST OF OUR CWA...BUT WILL CONTINUE THE 20 
POPS FOR THE PLATEAU COUNTIES FOR THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS 
FOR NOW. MOISTURE INCREASING ON SATURDAY AS A FRONT APPROACHES TO 
REGION...WILL KEEP THE 20 POPS GOING FOR SATURDAY. FRONT LINGERS 
ACROSS THE AREA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY ALONG WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE 
AND LIFT TO KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING BOTH DAYS. BASED ON LATEST 
TRENDS...STAYED ABOVE GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES.

THE FORECAST AREA WITH SUNSET. ONE STORM EVEN GAVE THE OFFICE 0.02 
INCHES BEFORE SUNSET THIS EVENING. MOST PLACES THOUGH SAW LITTLE TO 
NO PRECIPITATION. CURRENT TEMPERATURES AT THIS HOUR ARE CLOSE TO 
HOURLY GRIDS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF TYS WITH A WARM 84. DEW POINTS 
ARE A FEW DEGREES HIGHER THAN THE GRIDS EXCEPT AT LNP AND VJI WITH 
READINGS IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S. A DRIER POCKET OF AIR HAS MOVED 
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY WHERE DEW POINTS ARE IN THE LOWER 50S. 
LATEST 18Z MAV GUIDANCE CALLS FOR LOWS 50S TO LOWER 60S BUT THINK 
THE DRIER AIR WILL BE ACROSS ONLY NE TN AND SW VA TONIGHT AND A MORE 
MOIST LOW LEVEL ATMOSPHERE WILL LINGER IN EAST TN AND SW NC. WILL 
RAISE TONIGHTS LOWS A DEGREE OR TWO FROM TRI CITIES SOUTH TONIGHT.

WITH SLOW MOVEMENT SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. DECIDED NOT TO 
STRATEGICALLY POSITION POPS IN ANY ONE AREA AND JUST BROADBRUSHED AS

INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING GENERALLY ALONG A MEMPHIS TO CINCINNATI 
LINE. MODELS INDICATE THAT A FAIRLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP 
THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...BUT SOUNDINGS REVEAL A 
VERY DRY AIR MASS WITH ONLY A SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE AROUND 850 
MB. AS A RESULT...WILL PLAN TO GO WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH SOME VERY ISOLATED CONVECTION MAY DEVELOP NEAR 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARD A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST SINCE THE LOCAL AIR MASS IS NOT EXPECTED TO 
CHANGE MUCH THROUGH TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...CONTINUATION OF DRY WEATHER 
WITH ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS EXPECTED THROUGH MOST OF THE BALANCE OF THE

MOISTURE AND HEATING TO CAUSE A FEW SHOWERS TO DEVELOP MAINLY OVER 
THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AREAS LATE THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EARLY EVENING. THE COVERAGE OF THE SHOWERS WAS MINIMAL AND ONLY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HOT. DRY. WHAT ELSE IS THERE 
TO SAY? THE RIDGE IS BACK SUPPRESSING THINGS AND POPS ARE NEAR 
ZEE-RO. HAVE ADJUSTED MAXES/MINS TO NEAR A BLEND OF MODEL GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER RIDGE 
RE-ESTABLISHES ITSELF OVER THE REGION MID WEEK WHILE CONFIGURATION 
OF THE LOW LEVEL FLOW REMAINS EAST TO SOUTHEASTERLY. THIS REQUIRES 
TRANSIT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WHICH LEADS TO ADIABATIC 
WARMING AND DRYING IN THE GREAT VALLEY ESPECIALLY WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY BUT INFLUENCE MAY CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY AS WELL. DECIDED 
TO TRIM POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY DUE TO 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT RAPIDITY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTENING ON RETURN 
SOUTHERLY FLOW. AND KEPT POPS AT 20 PERCENT FOR SUNDAY DUE TO MODEL 
DEPICTION OF SLOW APPROACH AND EVENTUAL ARRIVAL OF UPPER TROF AND

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST AND EXTENDING ACROSS THE

NORTHEAST INTO EASTERN KY. THIS TROUGH IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN WEST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH A VERY DRY AIR MASS DEVELOPING

FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARD A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST WITH MAXES TODAY...BUT WILL GO WITH SLIGHTLY 
COOLER MINS TONIGHT SINCE DEWPOINTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE A LITTLE 
LOWER TONIGHT. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
GENERALLY AGREE THAT UPPER RIDGING WILL BECOME RE-ESTABLISHED OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AND PERSIST THROUGH MOST OF THE 
UPCOMING WORK WEEK. THIS WILL RESULT IN THE RETURN OF GENERALLY DRY
WEATHER WITH WELL ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS. UPPER RIDGE GRADUALLY DRIFTS
EASTWARD BY LATE WEEK ALLOWING SOMEWHAT BETTER MOISTURE FLOW INTO
THE REGION WITH DIURNAL MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN SCATTERED CONVECTION
EXPECTED. MODELS/ENSEMBLES STILL HINT THAT MORE ORGANIZED SYSTEM
WILL APPROACH OUR AREA BY SOMETIME NEXT WEEKEND. HOWEVER...TIMING
THIS EVENT IS PROBLEMATIC AT BEST AS MODELS AND ENSEMBLE MEMBERS
VARY CONSIDERABLY WITH RESPECT TO THE PROGRESSION OF THIS FEATURE.
WILL BE CONSERVATIVE WITH POPS FOR NOW...STAYING IN THE SLIGHT
CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE CATEGORY UNTIL TIMING ISSUES ARE RESOLVED.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CONVECTION ALIGNED LARGELY 
ALONG TERRAIN IN THE BLUE RIDGE MTNS AND ALONG THE CUMBERLAND 
ESCARPMENT, BUT MOVEMENT IS VERY SLOWLY TOWARD THE SOUTHWEST TOWARD 
AN INVERTED SURFACE TROF. TROF IS EXTENDING OUT OF A WEAK LOW OVER 
THE DEEP SOUTH. HOWEVER, STORMS/SHOWERS ARE STILL SPOTTY DUE TO LACK 
OF STRONG SURFACE FUEL. THETA E TROF LIES OVER CENTRAL VALLEY WITH 
COMPLICATED PATTERN OF RIDGING NORTHEAST AND SOUTHWEST. HENCE, 
MOVEMENT OF CELLS WILL DEPEND AS MUCH ON OUTFLOW BOUNDARY 
INTERACTION AS POSITION OF THETA E RIDGES AND PRESSURE TROFS. EXPECT 
THIS CONVECTIVE ACTION TO CONTINUE PAST SUNSET A LITTLE UNTIL HEAT 
SOURCE DIES AWAY. DO NOT EXPECT SEVERE WEATHER, HOWEVER A FEW 
STRONGER STORMS COULD PUSH THE ENVELOPE, AND SOME COULD PRODUCE 
ISOLATED SMALL STREAM/URBAN FLOODING IF THEY HOVER TOO LONG OVER ONE 
SPOT.

MODELS HAVE PULLED BACK ON THE POPS AND SO HAVE I IN THE FORECAST, 
EXCEPT FOR THIS EVENING, WHERE I HAVE INCREASED THEM TO ACCOUNT FOR 
CURRENT SITUATION. EXPECT THAT DRAINAGE FROM NORTHEASTERN SURFACE 
WILL KEEP AIR DRIER AND MORE STABLE THROUGH MONDAY, WITH MAINLY THE 
MTNS GETTING SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY TO WARRANT MENTION OF MOST 
PRECIP.

HAVE ALSO ADJUSTED OVERNIGHT MINS UP JUST A HAIR BECAUSE OF 
LIKELIHOOD OF A FEW MORE CLOUDS AND PATCHES OF RAIN. KEPT MENTION OF 
PATCHY FOG IN THE MORNING HOURS SUNDAY. ADJUSTED MAXES THROUGH 
MONDAY TO MATCH MORE A MIX OF MODELS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...GFS CONTINUES TO 
TREND TOWARD A DRIER AND WARMER UPCOMING WORK WEEK AS UPPER RIDGING 
STRENGTHENS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH A LOW LEVEL EASTERLY FLOW 
PERSISTING THROUGH FRIDAY. WHAT THIS MEANS FOR PRECIPITATION 
PROBABILITY IS ZERO POPS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WITH MAINLY MAJOR 
TERRAIN AREA POPS FOR THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. WITH THIS SLIGHT 
CHANGE TO A DRIER FORECAST COMPLETE WITH MORE UPPER LEVEL

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE

COMPARED TO THIS TIME YESTERDAY. ONCE AGAIN...IT APPEARS THAT THE 
AXIS OF BEST INSTABILITY WILL BE ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS...BUT ONLY 
MARGINAL AT BEST. THUS...WILL ONLY MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION FOR

MENTION SCATTERED COVERAGE OVER THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
PLAN TO FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE FORECAST SINCE THE LOCAL AIR MASS 
REMAINS ESSENTIALLY THE SAME AS YESTERDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAJOR ISSUE FOR THE LONG TERM 
IS THE CHANGE IN THE MODELS/ENSEMBLES TO A MUCH DRIER FORECAST 
THROUGH MOST OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK. MODELS/ENSEMBLES NOW DEPICT
MOISTURE BEING SUPPRESSED TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA BY UPPER RIDGING
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. AS SUCH...HAVE LOWERED POPS THROUGH
MOST OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. TEMPS ALSO DEPICTED TO CLIMB TO ABOVE
CLIMO UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE UPPER RIDGE. UPPER RIDGE DRIFTS
EAST ALLOWING MOIST RETURN FLOW BY LATE IN THE PERIOD. APPEARS THAT
A MORE ORGANIZED SYSTEM MAY APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION ON FRIDAY...BUT TIMING BECOMES AN ISSUE THIS FAR OUT. THUS
MAINTAINED CHANCE POPS FOR THAT TIME PERIOD. GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE
TO GFS GUIDANCE FOR BOTH TEMPS AND POPS AS THEY SEEM REASONABLE
GIVEN THE EXPECTED SYNOPTIC PATTERN.

.DISCUSSION...
COLD FRONT WELL PAST AREA...BUT LOW LEVER MOISTURE VERY SLOW TO DRY
OUT. THINKING DEW POINTS WILL HANG IN THE LOWER 60S NORTH AND MID
60S SOUTH...MAKING IT SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE FOR THE AFTERNOON. LOOKS
LIKE CAPE/LI VALUES OF AROUND 1200/-3 CAN BE EXPECTED DURING PRIME
HEATING. MID TO UPPER LEVELS LOOK QUITE DRY SO SOME EVAPORATIONAL
COOLING OF ENTRAINED AIR COULD ENHANCE COLD POOL
DEVELOPMENT...COULD HAVE A SOME ISOLATED DOWNBURSTS.

252 AM EDT FRI AUG 31 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES 
THAT A WEAK COLD FRONT IS LOCATED GENERALLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS...ACCORDING TO THE ISOBARS AND WINDS. HOWEVER...THETA-E 
ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT THE DRIER AIR WITH THIS FRONT RESIDES FARTHER 
NORTH IN THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A MOIST AIR MASS REMAINING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
SHOULD DEVELOP AGAIN BY THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE BEST INSTABILITY 
RESIDING OVER THE MOUNTAINS. THUS...WILL SCATTERED CONVECTION WITH 
THE HIGHEST POPS OVER THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE THREE SETS OF GUIDANCE WITH COOLER TEMPS 
(THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE) ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...GENERAL PATTERN OF RIDGING 
WEST/WEAK TROUGHING EAST EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF 
THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK BEFORE THE PATTERN ONCE AGAIN SHIFTS TO 
RIDGING OVER THE EASTERN CONUS BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK PER GFS. NO 
ORGANIZED PRECIP EVENT IN THE OFFING THROUGH THE LONG-TERM PERIOD 
WITH ONLY TYPICAL SCATTERED MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION EXPECTED EACH 
DAY. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE CLOSELY FOR BOTH POPS AND 
TEMPS...ALTHOUGH TENDED TO UNDERCUT POPS SLIGHTLY AS THEY SEEM 
GENERALLY OVERDONE...ESPECIALLY DURING THE OVERNIGHT PERIODS. TEMPS 
EXPECTED TO REBOUND TO ABOVE CLIMO NEXT WEEK AS THE RIDGING ONCE
AGAIN BECOMES ESTABLISHED OVER THE REGION.

.DISCUSSION...
AREA SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT DRY AIR IN THE MID LEVELS IS MOVING
INTO OUR AREA FROM THE NORTH. PRECIPITABLE WATER AT OHX HAS DROPPED
BELOW 1.5 INCHES...WHILE FFC REMAINS ABOVE 2 INCHES. THE INFLUX OF
DRY AIR AND THE LOSS OF SURFACE HEATING HAVE LED TO MOST OF THE
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DISSIPATE. WITH A SURFACE FRONT ACROSS
KENTUCKY SLOWLY MOVING TO THE SOUTH...AN ISOLATED SHOWERS CANNOT BE
RULED OUT OVERNIGHT...SO WILL LOWER POPS TO A SLIGHT CHANCE ACROSS
THE AREA. TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING CLOSE TO FORECAST...THOUGH LOWS
IN THE NORTH MAY NEED TO BE LOWERED A BIT DUE TO SOME CLEARING AND
FALLING DEWPOINTS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SURFACE FRONT STILL LINGERS WELL
TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND MODELS BRING IT SLOWLY
SOUTHWARD. HAVE KEPT FAIRLY HIGH POPS FOR TONIGHT IN AS A BLEND
BETWEEN DRIER GFS AND WETTER NAM MODEL GUIDANCE. TEMPERATURES WILL
REMAIN MODERATE TONIGHT WITH NOT A LOT OF RADIATIONAL COOLING.
FRIDAY SHOULD AGAIN SEE SOME SCATTERED ACTIVITY BUT LESS COVERAGE
THAN TODAY WITH LESS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO WORK FROM.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...LOWER PRESSURES WILL 
BE PRESENT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH THROUGH THE PERIOD WHILE IN THE LOW 
LEVELS...HIGHER PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN POSITION FROM THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE WESTERN ATLANTIC. THIS WILL KEEP AN EAST TO 
SOUTHEAST FLOW IN PLACE FOR MUCH OF THE DURATION WHICH WILL FEATURE 
A FLUX OF MOISTURE FROM THE ATLANTIC. USED SLIGHT AND CHANCE POPS 
AREAWIDE FOR SUNDAY AS MODELS INDICATE THAT AN INVERTED TROF WILL 
EXTEND NORTH AND NORTHEAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE FLORIDA 
PANHANDLE. GENERALLY STAYED WITH LESS THAN FIFTEEN PERCENT POPS FOR 
THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY DUE TO 
DOWNSLOPING IN THIS FLOW PATTERN WHILE MAINTAINING SLIGHT OR CHANCE 
POPS IN THE TERRAIN WHERE EASTERLY FLOW WILL ENABLE FOR OROGRAPHIC 
LIFTING. CONCERNING TEMPS...BASICALLY WENT A LITTLE HIGHER THAN 
GUIDANCE MAXES DUE TO THE DRY SURFACE CONDITION ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE IF NOT A DEGREE HIGHER THAN SUGGESTED MIN 
TEMPS.

WEAK COOL FRONT APPROACHES THE TENNESSEE VALLEY ON THURSDAY. SHOWER
ACTIVITY WILL BE INCREASING WITH THE APPROACH OF THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...
OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SREF PROJECT INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AS RETURN FLOW AROUND SURFACE
HIGH PRESSURE NEAR THE ATLANTIC COAST COMMENCES. HOWEVER...AM
SKEPTICAL OF THE RELATIVELY HIGH POPS PROJECTED BY GFS GUIDANCE IN
THE FIRST PERIOD AND HAVE GENERALLY UNDERCUT THOSE SOMEWHAT. POPS
FOR THE SECOND PERIOD LOOK MORE REASONABLE AS SCATTERED DIURNAL
CONVECTION DEVELOPS IN MOIST ATMOSPHERE REGIME...WITH SOMEWHAT
BETTER COVERAGE EXPECTED IN THE SOUTHERN TIER. GFS GUIDANCE TEMPS
LOOK REASONABLE FOR THE MOST PART AND DID NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM
THOSE VALUES. ANTICIPATE THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND THE
CORRESPONDING INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER WILL TEND TO HOLD TEMPS DOWN
IN THE SECOND PERIOD TO SOME DEGREE AS DEPICTED IN THE GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
MORE ORGANIZED LIFT SHOULD INCREASE THE CHANCES OF RAIN ON THURSDAY 
AS THE UPPER RIDGE IS SUPPRESSED TO THE SOUTH AND WEST BY AN UPPER 
TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THE FLOW REMAINS WEAK AND THE 
TROUGH IS RATHER BROAD...SO WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE FOR 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. BEST PRECIP CHANCES LOOK TO BE IN 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS CLOSER TO A WEAK 850 MB LOW. SURFACE COLD FRONT 
LOOKS LIKE IT STALLS ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND NEVER REACHES OUR 
AREA...SO THERE WILL BE NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN AIR MASS THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. THE GFS TAKES A WEAK 850 LOW OVER ALABAMA TO THE 
WEST...WHICH SUPPLIES MOISTURE TO THE AREA THROUGH TUESDAY. THE DEEP 
MOISTURE FROM THIS LOW IS A NEW FEATURE ON THE 12Z GFS...AND GIVEN 
THE DRY PATTERN WE HAVE BEEN STUCK IN...WILL AWAIT BETTER MODEL 
CONTINUITY BEFORE BITING ON HIGH POPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
NE OF THE AREA WEAKENS SLIGHTLY THROUGH PERIOD. WEAK CONVERGENCE AND 
MOISTURE TRANSPORT ALONG BOTTOM OF LOW LEVEL RIDGE WILL ENHANCE LOW 
CHC FOR CONVECTION TODAY MAINLY ACROSS S PART OF MRX CWA. MID LEVEL 
RIDGE AXIS IS CENTERED OVER AREA WITH WEAK STEERING FLOW. SLOW 
MOVING ISOLATED OROGRAPHIC CONVECTION POSSIBLE THIS AFTN FOR ENTIRE 
CWA. TEMPS OFF TO A WARM START THIS MORNING. 1000-850 MB THICKNESS 
VALUES EQUAL OR EXCEED MONDAYS HEIGHTS. MON MAX TEMPS RAN A FEW 
DEGREES ABOVE GUIDANCE AND THAT TREND SHOULD CONTINUE TODAY. FCST 
MAX TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW RECORD READINGS. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
A WEAK RIDGE REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHEAST WEDNESDAY...THEN RETROGRADES 
SOUTHWEST THURSDAY AS TROUGHING DEEPENS ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES.  
INCREASING MOISTURE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST WILL CONTRIBUTE TO MORE 
SCATTERED COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AND CONTINUE THROUGH 
FRIDAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER EACH DAY 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AND 500 MB HEIGHTS FALL. 
BEHIND THE FRONT DRIER HIGH PRESSURE MOVES IN. LATEST GFS TRIES TO 
KEEP MOISTURE ACROSS SOUTH AND WEST SUNDAY AND MONDAY BUT FOR NOW 
WILL KEEP DRIER. WILL KEEP HIGH TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDANCE 
WITH ON GOING DROUGHT AND LOWS NEAR GFS GUIDANCE.

.DISCUSSION...JUST A LITTLE MORE CONVECTION THAN I WOULD LIKE TO SEE 
WITH A ZERO POP IN PLACE ACROSS PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. APPARENTLY 
STORMS IN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY ARE FIRING ALONG CONVERGENCE ZONE IN 
AREA OF SLIGHTLY BETTER INSTABILITY. OTHER STORMS ARE ACTIVE ACROSS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
MOST OF THE DEEP MOISTURE HAS BEEN PUSHED WELL SOUTH OF OUR CWA BY
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH. ENOUGH LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE
REMAINS TO ALLOW ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION TO DEVELOP THIS
AFTERNOON...MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. ANTICIPATE MOST OF THIS
ACTIVITY TO DISSIPATE BY SUNSET...BUT DID CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS IN THE SOUTHERN TIER BASED ON PROXIMITY TO BETTER MOISTURE.
MUCH THE SAME STORY FOR TOMORROW. GENERALLY FAVORED LOWER GFS
GUIDANCE POPS GIVEN THE VERY DRY CONDITIONS BEING EXPERIENCED OVER
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. ALSO FOLLOWED THE GFS GUIDANCE
VALUES CLOSELY FOR TEMPS AS THEY SEEM REASONABLE GIVEN THE EXPECTED
CONDITIONS AND PERSISTENCE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A WEAK RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER MUCH OF THE EAST COAST ON 
WEDNESDAY...THEN BEGIN TO RETROGRADE ON THURSDAY. THE NAM SHOWS A 
NICE FEED OF GULF MOISTURE FROM LOUISIANA TO MIDDLE TN ON 
WEDNESDAY...BUT THE GFS IS DRIER. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE DRIER GFS AND 
HAVE ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR WEDNESDAY IN THE SOUTHERN AND 
WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. 500 MB HEIGHTS BEGIN TO FALL ON 
THURSDAY AS THE RIDGE MOVES WEST AND A TROUGH DIGS SOUTH OVER NEW 
ENGLAND WITH EAST TN IN A 700 MB DEFORMATION ZONE. THIS SHOULD 
PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE ORGANIZED LIFT...AND WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS 
THURSDAY NIGHT. A SURFACE FRONT PUSHES THROUGH ON FRIDAY...AND 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY. THIS SHOULD BRING TEMPERATURES DOWN CLOSER TO NORMAL FOR THE 
WEEKEND. THE GFS SHOWS SOME PRECIP WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH ON 
SUNDAY...BUT WILL KEEP THE WEEKEND DRY FOR NOW AS SUCH WEAK FEATURES 
ARE DIFFICULT TO PREDICT THIS FAR OUT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO REBUILD INTO THE AREA TODAY AND REMAIN THE MAIN WEATHER 
FEATURES THROUGHOUT THE SHORT TERM.  AS A RESULT...GENERALLY DRY 
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA.  HOWEVER...NORMAL 
DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND A 
STRAY THUNDERSTORM MAY REACH INTO THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES FROM 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY TO OUR SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...NORMAL SUMMERTIME

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...HARD TO LOCATE VERY WEAK 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY...BUT WEAK SURFACE TROUGH HAS MOVED THROUGH AND IS 
NOW TO OUR SOUTHEAST.  WEAK HIGH PRESSURE MOVES BY TO OUR NORTH IN 
THE SHORT TERM...AND HEIGHTS BEGIN TO RISE AGAIN.  LOOKS LIKE BEST 
CHANCE FOR ANY CONVECTION TOMORROW WILL BE SOUTH AND IN THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS...SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THOSE AREAS...DRY 
ELSEWHERE. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LATEST RUNS OF GFS HAVE 
SLOWED DOWN THE TRANSITIONAL PATTERN CHANGE AND ALSO PROJECT LESS 
AMPLITUDE TO THE TROUGH THAT EVENTUALLY DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN 
CONUS. THERE ARE ALSO PROFOUND DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE OPERATIONAL 
GFS AND THE GFS ENSEMBLES REGARDING PRECIP PATTERNS FOR THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION...WITH THE ENSEMBLES PROJECTING TYPICAL 
SCATTERED...MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGH THE LATER PART OF WORK 
WEEK AND INTO THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. THE OPERATIONAL GFS PROJECTS 
MORE ORGANIZED PRECIP FOR LATE IN THE WEEK AND WEEKEND WHICH WOULD 
BE A WELCOMED RELIEF TO THE AREA-WIDE DROUGHT CONDITIONS. THE 
ENSEMBLE SOLUTION SEEMS MORE REASONABLE...BUT BECAUSE OF THE 
RUN-TO-RUN DIFFERENCES IN THE GFS...DIVERGING SOLUTIONS OF OTHER 
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND A LARGER-THAN-NORMAL SPREAD BETWEEN THE GFS 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS...AM INCLINED TO NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO 
PREVIOUS FORECAST PACKAGE. STILL APPEARS TEMPS WILL SLOWLY FALL TO
NEAR CLIMO BY LATE IN THE UPCOMING WEEK AS HEIGHTS FALL IN RESPONSE
TO THE RIDGE WEST/TROUGH EAST TRANSITION.

235 PM EDT FRI AUG 24 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO 
FLATTEN OUT IN THE SHORT TERM...AND A WEAK COLD FRONT EDGES CLOSER.  
MODELS INDICATE A BETTER CHANCE OF PRECIP TOMORROW...AND MORE 
CLOUDS...WITH TEMPS LOWER THAN RECENT DAYS.  AM NOT OPTIMISTIC FOR A 
DRAMATIC CHANGE...SO WILL ONLY GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS...AND WILL 
GENERALLY GO A BIT ABOVE MAV TEMPS BOTH TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...FRONT CURRENTLY
CAUSING  CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN THE MIDWEST WILL TRY TO ASSERT
ITSELF HERE ON SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY, BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW. GFS
HAS A HUGE PRECIP BULLS EYE OVER THE CWA, BUT THIS APPEARS TO
CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK, SO WILL PARTLY IGNORE. BELIEVE FRONT WILL
DESTABILIZE AIR MASS ENOUGH TO RAISE POPS A HAIR, AND SOME SPOTS
WILL RECEIVE BOUNTIFUL WELCOME RAIN, BUT IT WILL BE LARGELY A GOOSE
EGG FOR MOST PLACES, AGAIN. UPPER RIDGE RETURNS TO DOMINANCE
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY, UNTIL THE NEXT POSSIBLE LITTLE SYSTEM
MOVES THROUGH. THIS LATER TIME PERIOD IS REALLY THE PROBLEM BECAUSE
MODELS SHOW A DRAMATIC PATTERN CHANGE WITH UPPER TROF SETTLING IN
OVER EASTERN NOAM, AND RIDGE MOVING WEST. THIS WOULD PUT US IN MUCH
COOLER TEMPERATURE REGIME. HOWEVER USUAL CAVEATS APPLY THIS FAR
OUT. PLUS, WEVE ALL BEEN BURNED BEFORE WITH THIS TYPE OF
ADVERTISED CHANGE DURING THE DEEPENING DROUGHT, SO I AM GUN SHY.
HAVE LEFT TEMPS FROM PREVIOUS PACKAGE ALONE PRETTY MUCH. AT THIS
POINT, COOLER MEANS JUST SEASONALLY HOT, NOT BLISTERING RECORDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...RIDGE BEGINS TO FLATTEN OUT 
JUST A BIT IN THE SHORT TERM...BUT STILL WILL BE OUR DOMINANT 
FEATURE IN THE SHORT TERM.  RADAR SHOWS A BIT MORE COVERAGE OF 
PRECIP TODAY THAN YESTERDAY...SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EARLY 
THIS EVENING. WILL ALSO GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN FOR TOMORROW.  WILL GENERALLY GO A BIT ABOVE GFS MOS 
TEMPS...BUT EVEN GOING ABOVE LEADS TO SLIGHTLY LOWER NUMBERS FOR 
TOMORROW THAN TODAY.  HOWEVER...RECORDS STILL IN JEOPARDY...SO WILL 
MENTION NEAR RECORD HIGHS.  MIXING CONTINUES TO PUSH RH VALUES LOWER 
THAN GUIDANCE INDICATES...AND EXPECT THE SAME TOMORROW. BASED ON 
THIS...HEAT INDEX VALUES SHOULD STAY BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE EXPECTED TO 
PERSIST THROUGH EARLY WEEKEND BEFORE GRUDGINGLY GIVING WAY TO AN 
UPPER TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL RESULT IN MARGINAL 
HEIGHT FALLS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ALONG WITH PUSHING A 
WEAK SURFACE FRONT INTO THE AREA BY LATE SATURDAY/EARLY SUNDAY. 
MOISTURE ACCOMPANYING THIS FEATURE NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE PER MODEL 
TIME-HEIGHTS...BUT SCATTERED CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE AS SURFACE FRONT 
STALLS OUT. SUFFICIENT MOISTURE PERSISTS TO PERMIT WIDELY SCATTERED 
MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION TO DEVELOP THROUGH MUCH OF THE UPCOMING
WORK WEEK BEFORE ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE FRONT COUPLET
APPROACHES ON THURSDAY RESULTING AGAIN IN THE POSSIBILITY OF
SOMEWHAT BETTER COVERAGE OF PRECIP. THERE ARE SOME INDICATIONS IN
THE ENSEMBLE DATA THAT THIS FEATURE MAY BE A PRECURSOR TO A GENERAL
PATTERN SHIFT...BUT TOO EARLY TO MAKE ANY DEFINITIVE PROJECTIONS AT
THIS TIME. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED ENSEMBLE MEAN GUIDANCE
VALUES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)... A RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE ENTRENCHED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL REMAIN
THE DOMINATE WEATHER FEATURE. PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY WILL ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB TO NEAR RECORD HIGHS. THE FOLLOWING ARE THE
CURRENT RECORDS:

CHA 102 SET BACK IN 1968...FORECAST HIGH OF 102 TODAY.
TYS 99 SET BACK IN 1968...FORECAST HIGH OF 100 TODAY.
TRI 94 SET BACK IN 1968...FORECAST HIGH OF 95 TODAY.

DUE TO THE CONTINUED DROUGHT CONDITIONS...AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS WILL
MIX OUT INTO THE 60S...WHICH WILL LIMIT HEAT INDICES TO THE UPPER
90S TO 105 SOUTH. HAVE ISSUED A HEAT ADVISORY FOR THE SOUTHERN
TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR TODAY.

GENERALLY WENT A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN GUIDANCE HIGHS DUE TO
THE EXTREMELY DRY SOIL MOISTURE.

UPPER RIDGE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WILL LIMIT CONVECTION
DEVELOPMENT DUE TO CONTINUED PRESENCE OF MID-LEVEL CAP.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS ANCHORED OVER THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH 
MOST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSES BY TO THE 
NORTH ON SUNDAY...AND WILL INCLUDE LOW CHANCE POPS WITH THIS 
FEATURE. THE RIDGE STRENGTHENS AND EXPANDS...BECOMING CENTERED OVER 
TN FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS SHOULD KEEP THE AREA DRY...AND 
WILL REMOVE THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EACH DAY. TEMPERATURES WILL 
CONTINUE ABOVE NORMAL.

RADAR SHOWS A FEW SHOWERS HAVE TRIED TO GET GOING...BUT THEY HAVE
BEEN SMALL AND SHORT LIVED SO FAR. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH COVERAGE...BUT
WILL CARRY MINIMAL POPS FOR AFTERNOON HOURS BEFORE DROPPING BELOW
15% BY BEGINNING OF TONIGHT PERIOD. EXPECT SIMILAR CONDITIONS
TOMORROW...WITH RECORD HIGH TEMPERATURES ONCE AGAIN IN JEOPARDY.
WILL GO WITH SILENT (BELOW 15%) POPS AS EXPECT VERY LITTLE COVERAGE
OF CONVECTION. DESPITE NEAR RECORD TEMPS...MIXING SHOULD KEEP DEW
POINTS LOW ENOUGH TOMORROW TO STAY BELOW HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA
ONCE AGAIN.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)... UPPER RIDGE
BEGINS TO MOVE TO THE SOUTHWEST TOWARDS THE DEEP SOUTH AND LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FRIDAY AS A TROUGH MOVES TOWARD THE WESTERN
GREAT LAKES. NOT MUCH CHANGE FOR THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY EXCEPT
TEMPERATURES A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN THURSDAY (BUT STILL HOT)
DUE TO MORE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE AFTERNOON MOUNTAINS AS WEAK SHORT WAVE
ENERGY MOVES ACROSS. SATURDAY MOISTURE INCREASES A LITTLE MORE
AHEAD OF WEAK COLD FRONT SO SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
AREAWIDE LOOKS GOOD AND HIGH TEMPERATURES MOSTLY LOWER TO MID 90S
MOST PLACES. MINOR TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN STATES SUNDAY WITH FRONT
ACROSS FORECAST AREA SHOULD ALLOW FOR BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE EXTENDED AND MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES UPPER
80S TO LOWER 90S. MONDAY AND TUESDAY RIDGE STRENGTHENS AGAIN OVER
THE OH AND TN VALLEYS BUT FRONTS LEFT OVER MOISTURE SHOULD ALLOW

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
THE STRONG, VERTICALLY STACKED HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER AL THIS 
MORNING WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH TODAY...WITH A SLIGHT 
WESTWARD DRIFT ON THURSDAY. A SHORTWAVE RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER OUR 
AREA TODAY...GIVING A MORE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT AND KEEPING THE

THUS GIVES MUCH HIGHER POPS. THERE APPEARS TO BE LITTLE FORCING FOR

LOW LEVEL FLOW FROM THE EAST-SOUTHEAST MAY GIVE SOME ISOLATED 
SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AFTERNOON...BUT MOST OF 
THE AREA WILL STAY DRY. TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABOVE NORMAL...AND 
WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WARMER SIDE OF THE MOS GUIDANCE. 

THE RED FLAG WATCH FOR CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES WILL BE 
CONTINUED...AND WILL WAIT UNTIL A MORNING CONFERENCE CALL WITH NC 
STATE FORESTRY OFFICIALS BEFORE MAKING ANY CHANGES.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
OPPRESSIVE UPPER RIDGE BECOMES FURTHER SURPRESSED INTO THE DEEP
SOUTH AND LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AS TROUGH MAKES ITS WAY EAST
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEAST U.S. THROUGH THE PERIOD.
DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PREVIOUS FORECAST SCENARIO WHICH
FEATURES MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION WITH MINOR
EMPHASIS IN THE TERRAIN FOR SATURDAY. AS UPPER TROUGH MAKES
PROGRESS THROUGH THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY ON
SUNDAY...COOL FRONT DROPS SOUTHEAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA. WITH
SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY BUILDING SOUTH WENT AHEAD AND ADJUSTED POPS UP TO
LOW CHANCE. KEPT PRIMARILY SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION FOR THE
REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST AS FRONT WEAKENS AND LOW LEVEL
FLOW BECOMES SOUTHERLY AGAIN. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO SUGGESTED
GUIDANCE TEMPS.

251 AM EDT TUE AUG 21 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
STRONG HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS ENTRENCHED ACROSS THE THE 
SOUTHEAST U.S. THE RIDGE BECOMES SLIGHTLY ELONGATED EAST TO WEST 
TODAY...WHICH MAY ALLOW A SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER THE MS VALLEY TO 
CROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS OF OUR AREA THIS AFTERNOON. GOOD INSTABILITY 
AND MORE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD LEAD TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE NORTHERN SECTIONS. THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SW 
NC MAY STAY DRY AS WARMER MID LEVEL TEMPS CLOSER TO THE RIDGE WILL 
GIVE MORE STABLE CONDITIONS IN THE SOUTH. ON WEDNESDAY THE RIDGE 
RETROGRADES FROM THE COAST TO MS/AL/GA...WHICH SHOULD FURTHER 
STABILIZE THE AIR MASS IN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. THE NAM HAS A SLIGHTLY WEAKER RIDGE AND GIVES HIGH 
CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH ON WEDNESDAY...BUT WILL GO WITH THE 
GFS...WHICH IS DRY...AS THE NAM SEEMS TO BE TOO WET LATELY. 
CONTINUED SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE RIDGE SHOULD KEEP THE AREA DRY AGAIN 
ON THURSDAY. LEANED TOWARD THE WARMER MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH 
THE PERIOD FOR TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
RIDGE AXIS GRADUALLY SLIPS SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA
DURING THE LONG TERM ALLOWING FOR A SLOW INCREASE IN MOISTURE. IN
ADDITION...TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL BE A LITTLE COOLER ALLOWING FOR
BETTER INSTABILITY. STILL A LITTLE QUESTIONABLE AS TO THE
POSSIBILITY OF A WEAK FROPA SOMETIME DURING THE WEEKEND AS RIDGE
RETREATS A BIT. BASICALLY KEPT FORECAST THE SAME FROM PREVIOUS
PACKAGE BUT KEPT POPS AT SLIGHT CHANCE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD DUE TO
THE UNCERTAINTY OF SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY HAVING MUCH OF AN IMPACT ON
THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP 
OVER THE REGION FOR THIS EVENING...WITH BEST CHANCES ACROSS OUR 
NORTHERN ZONES.  A SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH...CONTINUING THE 
CHANCE FOR A STRAY THUNDERSTORM THROUGH AT LEAST MIDNIGHT.  HIGH 
PRESSURE REMAINS IN CONTROL ON TUESDAY.  HOWEVER...A WEAK WAVE 
MOVING THROUGH COULD ALLOW FOR SCATTERED TO ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
DURING THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...PERSISTENCE. RIDGE STAYS 
PUT OVER SOUTHEAST, WITH WIMPY FRONT ON THE WEEKEND. I REALLY HAVE 
NO CONFIDENCE THIS FRONT WILL ACTUALLY MAKE IT THROUGH THE AREA, 
THOUGH IT COULD...REPEAT COULD...MOVE WHAT LITTLE MOISTURE WE HAVE 
UP A LITTLE AND MAKE SOME CLOUDS BIG ENOUGH IN THE MOUNTAINS AND 
NORTHEAST TO DROP SOME LIGHT WATER AS A TEASE IN SOME SPOTS. OTHER 
THAN THAT, ITS MORE HOT AND HUMID UNTIL THE WEEKEND. IF THE FRONT 
DROPS THIS FAR SOUTH, IT MAY ACTUALLY DRY THINGS A HAIR, WHICH WILL 
HELP WITH THE HEAT INDICES BUT HURT THE FIRE SITUATION. STAY TUNED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SOUTHWEST FLOW AROUND THE 
PERIPHERY OF A STRONG RIDGE OFF THE EAST COAST BROUGHT INCREASING 
MOISTURE TO THE AREA YESTERDAY...LEADING TO SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE PLATEAU. WITH THE RIDGE REMAINING NEARLY

A LITTLE MORE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH TODAY...SO THERE MAY BE A LITTLE 
MORE SHOWER COVERAGE. HOWEVER WILL OPT TO KEEP POPS IN THE SLIGHT 
CHANCE RANGE OVER THE MOUNTAINS...SW VA...AND THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. AS WE ARE SEEING THIS MORNING...SHOWERS MAY PERSIST AFTER 
SUNSET...SO WILL KEEP POPS GOING IN NORTHERN SECTIONS UNTIL 06Z. 
WITH SLIGHTLY MORE MOISTURE IN PLACE...HIGH TEMPS SHOULD BE A BIT 
LOWER THAN PREVIOUS DAYS...BUT WILL STILL LEAN TOWARD THE HIGHER END 
OF MOS FOR TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN 
CONTROL DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE PERIOD.  A FEW WEAK SHORTWAVES

NORTHERN AREAS ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  A FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION ON SATURDAY... 
WITH STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING...WILL KEEP JUST SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.  THE WARM WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WARM FRONT STRETCHING FROM NEAR CHICAGO SOUTHEAST 
ACROSS WEST VA INTO CENTRAL VA. SOUTHWEST WIND FLOW BEHIND THIS 
FRONT SHOULD HELP TO GRADUALLY INCREASE MOISTURE LEVELS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA INTO MONDAY. AS A RESULT...WILL MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED CONVECTION AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS FOR 
TONIGHT AND MONDAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE REMNANTS 
OF ERIN (CURRENTLY OVER OK) MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY...WITH MOST OF ITS MOISTURE REMAINING 
NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...MOISTURE SHOULD INCREASE 
ENOUGH ON TUESDAY TO JUSTIFY MENTIONING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
CONVECTION AREAWIDE...WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA 
AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. UNFORTUNATELY...MODELS AGREE THAT THE 
UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEAST WILL BUILD BACK TOWARD THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY BY THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...BRINGING WARMER TEMPS AND A 
CONTINUATION OF STAGNANT CONDITIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
KEEP TEMPS A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN GUIDANCE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
PERIOD...SINCE THIS HAS BEEN THE TREND FOR A WHILE. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
PATTERN EXPECTED THROUGH THE EXTENDED WITH HIGH PRESSURE REMAINING 
THE DOMINATE WEATHER FEATURE. STRONG DIURNAL HEATING AND WEAK 
INSTABILITY COMBINED WITH A COUPLE OF WEAK IMPULSES WILL PROVIDE US 
WITH NORMAL SUMMER CONVECTION WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY FOR A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT...MAINLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WARM FRONT JUST NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA ALONG THE KY/WV BORDER...STRETCHING SOUTHEAST INTO 
CENTRAL NC. SOUTHWEST WIND FLOW BEHIND THIS FRONT SHOULD HELP TO 
GRADUALLY INCREASE MOISTURE LEVELS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. 
LOCAL AIR MASS STILL REMAINS FAIRLY DRY...BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS 
SUGGEST THAT THERE MAY BE ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THIS AFTERNOON. 

CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK OVERALL...BUT WILL UPDATE THIS 
MORNING TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A WEAK FRONT APPROACHES THE 
REGION FROM THE NORTH TODAY AND LINGERS INTO MONDAY.  BEST MOISTURE 
REMAINS NORTH...BUT INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE...SO WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR OUR NORTHERN ZONES AND THE MOUNTAINS 
WHERE THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT IS PRESENT ON BOTH SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY.  MODELS BRING A SHORTWAVE INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY.  GFS 
INDICATED MORE MOISTURE THAN ETA PUSHING INTO OUR AREA.  WITH THE 
RIDGE IN PLACE WILL KEEP ONLY 20 POPS FOR TUESDAY.  WARM 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD.  HEAT INDICES MAY 
APPROACH THE 100-105 DEGREE RANGE IN SOUTHEAST TN TODAY.  STAYED 
NEAR THE NGM/MET/MAV BLEND NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)... HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS 
IN CONTROL THROUGH THE PERIOD...BUT A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES ROTATING 
OVER THE RIDGE COMBINED WITH THE WEAK INSTABILITY COULD TRIGGER 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS.  SO WILL CONTINUE WITH THE SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR WEDNESDAY AND SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE COLD FRONT MAY HAVE MOVED THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA (JUDGING FROM THE ISOBAR PATTERN AND WIND FIELD)... 
ALTHOUGH THE LATEST THETA-E ANALYSIS REVEALS THAT DRIER AIR REMAINS 
NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...THE FRONT MAY ACTUALLY EXTEND 
ALONG THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND ALONG THE KY/VA BORDER. 
THIS FRONT SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH AN ISOLATED TSTORM STILL POSSIBLE 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN BEFORE SUNSET. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD 
INTO THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH GENERALLY DRY AND 
UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS CONTINUING. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL INCREASE ENOUGH ON SUNDAY TO TRIGGER A 
FEW ISOLATED TSTORMS ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. TEMPS SHOULD 
DECREASE A FEW DEGREES FOR THE WEEKEND...BUT WILL STILL REMAIN 
UNSEASONABLY WARM. WILL PLAN TO TREND A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN 
GUIDANCE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN 
CONTROL OF AREA WEATHER THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED. A WEAKENING FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL BE TO OUR NORTH ON MONDAY AND MAY SEE SOME ASSOCIATED 
CONVECTION...THOUGH GENERALLY CONFINED TO HIGHER TERRAIN. A WEAK 
SHORT WAVE WILL BE ROTATING AROUND THE HIGH ON TUESDAY AND WILL 
CONTINUE THE LOW POPS ACROSS THE AREA. NORMAL SUMMERTIME DIURNAL 
CONVECTION EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY OVER FAVORED AREAS. FINALLY...LOW

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LEE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN SIDE 
OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT LIKELY STILL 
NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE DRIER AIR RESIDES. OVERALL..ITS 
DIFFICULT TO DISCERN WHERE THIS FRONT IS LOCATED SINCE WINDS ARE 
LIGHT AND THE DRIER AIR MASS BEHIND THE FRONT IS NOT REALLY MUCH 
DRIER THAN THE CURRENT AIR MASS. MORNING BNA SOUNDING REVEALS MORE 
MID-LEVEL MOISTURE THAN YESTERDAY...WITH A VERY DRY BOUNDARY LAYER 
REMAINING. THIS MID-LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR SOME 
ISOLATED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE DRY 
AIR IN THE LOWER-LEVELS POSSIBLY PRODUCING SOME DAMAGING WINDS WITH 
A FEW STORMS. ALTHOUGH MINS WERE VERY WARM THIS MORNING...MORE CLOUD 
COVER TODAY SHOULD HELP TO KEEP MAXES A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN 
YESTERDAY.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK. WILL PLAN TO UPDATE 
THE ZONES THIS MORNING TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING. RECORD HIGHS FOR 
THIS DATE ARE HIGHER THAN PREVIOUS DAYS: CHA (102)...TYS (101)...OQT

UPPER DIVERGENCE. A WEAK SURFACE FRONT...WHICH IS REALLY MORE OF A 
WIND SHIFT THAN A TEMPERATURE DISCONTINUITY...IS LOCATED IN THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY. SOME SHOWERS ARE AHEAD OF THE TROUGH ACROSS KY. THE 
TROUGH WILL PUSH SOUTH INTO OUR AREA TODAY. THIS TROUGH AND 
LINGERING OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM CONVECTION THIS MORNING WILL HELP 
PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE FOCUS FOR THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON. 
ALTHOUGH SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL LIKELY FALL WITH DAYTIME 
MIXING...AND ARE PROBABLY TOO HIGH IN THE MODELS AS HAS BEEN THE 
CASE THE PAST FEW DAYS...850 THETA-E VALUES ARE HIGH AND SHOULD 
SUPPORT SOME STRONG THUNDERSTORMS. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE 
ALSO A LITTLE HIGHER TODAY. WILL GO ABOVE MOS POPS TODAY...AND SHOW 
SCATTERED STORMS IN THE SOUTH WITH ISOLATED NORTH. WILL ALSO HAVE 
HIGH AND LOW TEMPS ON THE HIGHER SIDE OF GUIDANCE...AS THE MOS HAS 
VERIFIED TOO COOL THE PAST FEW DAYS...ESPECIALLY WITH LOW TEMPS....

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN 
ON SATURDAY ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN STABILITY...WILL KEEP SATURDAY 
DRY.  A FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION FROM THE NORTH ON SUNDAY AND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A 
HOT AND DRY AIR MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE WRF MODEL HAS 
INITIALIZED WELL WITH THE COMPLEX OF TSTORMS CURRENTLY OVER SOUTHERN 
ILLINOIS AND INDIANA...AND IT INDICATES THAT THIS COMPLEX WILL 
AFFECT SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN LATER TONIGHT. THIS COMPLEX 
SHOULD DIMINISH IN COVERAGE AS IT NEARS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST 
TN DUE TO THE VERY DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE...BUT WITH A FAIRLY DEEP 
DRY BOUNDARY LAYER...THINK THAT SOME OF THESE TSTORMS COULD GENERATE 
STRONG DAMAGING WINDS. WILL KEEP A MENTION OF PRECIP FOR TONIGHT 
EVERYWHERE...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST 
TN. MODELS INDICATE THAT A BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST 
WILL PUSH THE COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNRISE 
TOMORROW MORNING...BUT THINK THIS MAY BE TOO AGGRESSIVE (CONSIDERING 
SO FAR THE FRONT HASNT MOVED AS FAST AS THE MODEL HAVE BEEN 
INDICATING). THINK THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL BE SLOWER TO MOVE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...AND SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR FRIDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...TEMPS SHOULD 
GRADUALLY DECREASE A FEW DEGREES EACH DAY AS WINDS BECOME NORTHERLY 
BEHIND THE FRONT. HOWEVER...THIS COLD FRONT WILL NOT BRING MUCH OF A 
COOL DOWN...WITH TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE NORMAL INTO THE WEEKEND.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS THE 
DOMINATE WEATHER FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED. WEAK MOISTURE 
RETURN FLOW SETTING UP SUNDAY AND MONDAY. WILL KEEP LOW POPS 
CONFINED TO HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH MONDAY AND ACROSS THE CWA 
TUESDAY. FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...CONFIDENCE LOW ON TIMING AND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MORE HIGH TEMPERATURE RECORDS 
MAY FALL BY THE WAYSIDE THIS AFTERNOON...IF AIR MASS CAN REMAIN 
FAIRLY DRY.  HEART OF WARMEST AIR WAS STILL SLIGHTLY TO WEST OF AREA 
WEDNESDAY...BUT TRAJECTORY FORECASTS SHOW FLOW FROM SFC THROUGH 1500 
METERS RIGHT FROM THAT AREA...SO THINK KCHA WILL BE RIGHT BACK ABOUT 
103 TODAY AND KTYS AND KTRI SHOULD BE EVEN WARMER THAN YESTERDAYS 
READINGS RESPECTIVELY.  DEW POINTS RIGHT NOW RIDING PRETTY 
HIGH...BUT SHOULD MIX OUT AGAIN AND DROP OFF TO LOWER LEVELS.  WITH 
RELATIVELY DRY AIR...HEAT INDEX VALUES SHOULD BE RIGHT NEAR AIR 
TEMPS THIS AFTERNOON...AND SHOULD MOSTLY STAY BELOW 105 DEGREES...SO 
NOT PLANNING A HEAT ADVISORY AT THIS TIME.

CONVECTION CHANCES FOR THIS AFTERNOON LOOK LESS THAN THEY DID AT 
THIS TIME YESTERDAY...DUE TO LACK OF LOW-LEVER RICH MOISTURE.  
KEEPING SOME LOW POPS IN FOR MUCH OF THE AREA...BUT THERE MAY NOT BE 
ANY STORMS THIS AFTERNOON.  

WEAK COLD FRONT SHOULD BE ENTERING NORTHERN AREAS THIS EVENING AND 
IT WILL BE BRINGING SOME MOISTURE WITH IT.  SO KEEPING SOME POPS IN 
OVERNIGHT AND EVEN THROUGH FRIDAY AS DEW POINTS SHOULD BE 5-10 
DEGREES HIGHER FRIDAY AFTERNOON VERSUS THIS AFTERNOON.

FRONT WILL STRUGGLE TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE AREA FRIDAY...AND MAY 
LINGER IN THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...INITIAL PERIOD OF 
FRIDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE MOSTLY DRY DUE TO LITTLE FASTER TIMING OF 
WEAK COLD FRONT...ALTHO CANT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED TSRA FRI EVENING 
OVER AT LEAST SE TN/SW NC...KEPT POPS AT 14 PERCENT OR LESS TO BE 
CONSISTENT WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES. 

NORTHEAST U.S. TROUGH LIFTS NE OVER THE WEEKEND AND ALLOWS THE UPPER 
RIDGE TO FLEX/BUILD BACK ACROSS THE REGION. THIS SHOULD EQUATE TO A 
DRY AND SEASONABLY HOT SATURDAY...AND DRY FOR MOST OF SATURDAY NIGHT.
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW RETURNS FROM SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...WITH 
TIME HEIGHT SECTIONS SHOWING AN INCREASE IN BOTH LOW LEVEL AND UPPER 
LEVEL MOISTURE. THIS WILL FAVOR AT LEAST ISOLATED TO WIDELY 
SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION THESE DAYS...SO HARD TO MAKE ANY REAL 
IMPROVEMENTS TO PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. MOS POPS INCREASED SLIGHTLY 
ON MONDAY INTO TUESDAY...BUT NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO RAISE ANY AREAS

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
250 PM EDT WED AUG 15 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH 
A HOT AND DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS SHOULD CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY FOR ONE MORE DAY...BEFORE GRADUALLY SHIFTING FURTHER 
SOUTH AS AN UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE NORTHEAST. THIS UPPER 
TROUGH WILL HELP PUSH THE WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH MID-LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THIS FRONT. AS A RESULT...THINK THAT SOME 
ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON AS INSTABILITY 
LEVELS BEGIN TO RISE. GFS AND WRF MODELS INDICATE SOME LARGE 
DISCREPANCIES WITH THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY POSSIBLE TOMORROW...AND 
WILL GENERALLY COMPROMISE WITH THE TWO SOLUTIONS BY INTRODUCING LOW 
POPS AREAWIDE. WITH THE COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT...THINK THAT SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE 
AREAWIDE. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A FAIRLY DEEP INVERTED-V SHAPED 
BOUNDARY LAYER...SO THINK THAT A FEW SEVERE TSTORMS WITH DAMAGING 
WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND TOMORROW NIGHT. THIS 
SLOW-MOVING COLD FRONT SHOULD STILL BE LINGERING AROUND THE FORECAST 
AREA ON FRIDAY...SO WILL KEEP SMALL POPS IN THE FORECAST ON FRIDAY. 

AS FOR TEMPS...EXPECT SIMILAR TEMPS TOMORROW TO THOSE OBSERVED 
TODAY...ALTHOUGH SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION MAY INTERRUPT WARMING IN A 
FEW AREAS. MOISTURE LEVELS SHOULD BE A LITTLE HIGHER TOMORROW...BUT 
WILL NOT ISSUE A HEAT ADVISORY SINCE HEAT INDICES SHOULD BRIEFLY 
REACH 105 DEGREES ONLY AROUND THE CHATTANOOGA VICINITY. HOWEVER... 
WILL CONTINUE THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT HIGHLIGHTING THE HOT 
CONDITIONS. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MAINTAINED A DRY FORECAST 
FOR SATURDAY AS MODEL SOLUTIONS INDICATE AMPLIFICATION OF 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. UPPER TROF ON FRIDAY. THIS WILL HELP TO PUSH COOL 
FRONT THROUGH THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY. ABILITY TO KEEP 
POPS FOR CONVECTION OUT OF THE FORECAST IS GONE THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAKES ITS WAY 
BACK THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY. SURFACE THROUGH UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGE SLIPS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE FIRST THREE DAYS OF THE WORK 
WEEK ALLOWING FOR THE RETURN OF GULF AND ATLANTIC MOISTURE. SEVERAL 
WEAK IMPULSES AS WELL AS LATER SUMMER INSOLATION WILL PROVIDE 
SUFFICIENT LIFT TO KEEP THE CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT 
GOING THROUGH THIS PERIOD. STAYED RATHER CLOSE TO SUGGESTED GUIDANCE 
TEMPS IN THE LONG TERM.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID 
WEST...WITH A DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AN UPPER-LEVEL 
HIGH CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS IS PROGGED TO SHIFT TOWARDS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY...WHICH SHOULD PUSH TEMPS A FEW DEGREES 
WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A VERY DRY AIR MASS 
THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE LOCAL ATMOSPHERE...SO DONT EXPECT ANY 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK. WILL PLAN TO UPDATE 
THE ZONES THIS MORNING FOR MAINLY MINOR COSMETIC CHANGES OF 
MENTIONING HOT CONDITIONS AND NEAR RECORD HIGHS. RECORD HIGHS FOR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE EXPECTED TO SWELL 
BACK OVER AREA TODAY AND EXPECTING TEMPERATURES TO RESPOND A COUPLE 
OF DEGREES HIGHER.  ALSO...RELATIVELY DRY LOWER AIRMASS WITH DEW 
POINTS IN THE 50S YESTERDAY AFTERNOON STILL BE OVER AREA FOR TODAY.  
AFTER DEEP MIXING STARTS...THINK MOST DEW POINTS WILL LOWER AGAIN.

FORECASTING RECORD HIGH TEMP FOR KCHA TODAY...BUT SHOULD NOT 
NEED A HEAT ADVISORY DUE TO COOLER MORNING TEMPS AND LOWER 
HUMIDITIES KEEPING HEAT INDEX VALUES NEAR THE ACTUAL AIR TEMP.

LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STARTS TO FLOW BACK INTO THE AREA TONIGHT AND 
THURSDAY.  WILL INTRODUCE SOME POPS INTO NORTHERN SECTIONS FOR 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS CAP SHOULD BE WEAKENING AS GREAT LAKES UPPER 
TROUGH BUILDS SOUTHWARD.  LOOKS LIKE TEMPS WILL BE 1-2 DEGREES 
COOLER THURSDAY...BUT HEAT INDEX READINGS WILL BE 1-2 DEGREES HOTTER 
DUE TO ADDITION OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...INITIAL FEATURE FOR 
THESE PERIODS THAT MAY AID DEVELOPMENT OF CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION 
(PCPN) IS THE WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE NW THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY. KEPT POPS IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY FOR NOW GIVEN 
LATE NIGHT AND EARLY DAYTIME TIMING...NOT DURING PEAK HEATING. THIS 
FEATURE IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH BY EARLY FRIDAY EVENING...SO 
OPTED TO REMOVE POPS FOR ALL BUT SE TN/SW NC FOR FRIDAY NIGHT.

OTHERWISE...UPPER RIDGE REMAINS RATHER STRONG AND GENERALLY IN 
CONTROL FROM PLAINS STATES ACROSS THE SRN STATES FOR THE 
PERIOD...WITH A FEW PERIODS OF CONVECTION POSSIBLE AS SHORTWAVE 
ENERGY PASSES THROUGH THE MIDWEST STATES AND OHIO VALLEY. ALSO...
WEAK LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW INTO THE REGION BY MONDAY INTO TUESDAY 
SHOULD BRING AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE...BUT THE TROPICAL MOISTURE 
LOOKS TO REMAIN TO OUR WEST. TWEAKED A FEW AREAS UP TO LOWER END OF 
CHANCE POPS...BUT FOR THE MOST PART KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING.

MIN AND MAX TEMPS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY EACH DAY IN LINE WITH THE LATEST 
GFS/GFSX MOS GUIDANCE...AND TO REMAIN IN TOLERANCE WITH NEIGHBORING 
GRIDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE AREA 
BRINGING WARM AND DRY WEATHER FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY.  WITH THE 
WEAK INSTABILITY AND LIMITED MOISTURE...PROBABLY NOT SEE ANY 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY THIS EVENING.  A DYING MCS MAY TRACK SOME 
DEBRIS CLOUDS INTO THE AREA EARLY THIS EVENING...BUT SHOULD NOT 
AFFECT TEMPERATURES.  A SHORTWAVE ROTATES ACROSS THE RIDGE LATE ON 
WEDNESDAY.  BEST DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH OF THE CWA...SO 
KEPT WEDNESDAY DRY.  WITH THE QUESTIONABLE PERFORMANCE OF THE GFS 
MOS...TENDED MORE TOWARD THE WRF AND NGM FOR TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER
THE AREA WED NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WILL GRADUALLY GIVE WAY TO DIGGING
GREAT LAKES TROUGH...WITH NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. COLD FRONT EXPECTED
TO PUSH INTO THE AREA LATE THU NIGHT OR FRIDAY. WILL KEEP THINGS
DRY UNTIL THU NIGHT...WHEN WILL BRING SLIGHT CHANCE POPS INTO
NORTH. FORCING AND MOISTURE NOT IMPRESSIVE...SO STILL JUST SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY. DRIER AIR EXPECTED FOR SATURDAY...THEN
MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE FOR
SUNDAY AND THE FIRST PART OF THE WEEK. GIVEN THE DROUGHT WE ARE
IN...WILL NOT GO HIGHER THAN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY THROUGH
TUESDAY. MOST SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO GFS MOS TEMPS WILL BE TO GO
HIGHER FOR KTRI WED NIGHT...AND TO LOWER SOME MAX TEMPS FOR KRHP.
OTHERWISE...MAINLY JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SLIGHTLY LOWER DEW POINT TEMPS 
NOTED THIS MORNING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...ALTHO TEMPS GENERALLY 
REMAIN VERY MILD TO WARM (CONTINUING THE TREND NOTED WITH GFS MOS 
MIN TEMPS A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES TOO COOL EACH NIGHT). LOOKED 
BACKED ON DEW POINT TEMP TREND FROM YESTERDAY...VIEWED NEW MOS AND 
MADE SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.

CERTAINLY ONLY FEATURE OF CONCERN IS MAX TEMPS AND ASSOCIATED HEAT 
INDICES. PERSISTENCE ON MAX TEMPS WAS CLOSER FOR FRIDAY MAX TEMPS
...AND OPTED FOR AGAIN TODAY. THESE MAX TEMPS AND ADJUSTED DEW POINT 
TEMPS PRODUCE HEAT INDICES BELOW ADVISORY VALUES...BUT MIGHT BE 
WORTHY OF ANOTHER SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT (SPSMRX). 

CONSIDERING GFS TRACK RECORD ON MINS (TOO COOL)...CHOSE TO USE A 
BLEND OF NAM-WRF AND GFS MOS FOR TONIGHTS LOWS. GENERALLY LESS THAN 
10 PERCENT POPS CARRIED OVER FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST...GIVEN THE 
STRENGTH OF THE UPPER RIDGE AND LIMITED MOISTURE FOR CONVECTION.


LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...VERY STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
CONTINUES OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES BUT EXTENDING THROUGH ALL 
THE SOUTHEAST. THE UPPER FLOW WILL BE FROM THE NORTHWEST WITH THE 
FORECAST AREA ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE RIDGE. WILL BE USING 
PERSISTENCE FOR THE FORECAST WITH TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL. HEAT INDEX VALUES WILL REACH NEAR 105 IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY 
AGAIN MONDAY. A WEAK FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH MONDAY BUT WITH 
STRENGTH OF RIDGE AM REMOVING CHANCE OF RAIN. HEAT INDEX VALUES WILL 
STILL REACH 100 TO 105 IN THE SOUTH THROUGH THURSDAY. ANOTHER 
STRONGER FRONT WILL APPROACH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AND SHOULD HELP

WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. TEMPS FRI AND SAT WILL BE A FEW DEGREES 
COOLER THEN RESENT READINGS BUT REMAIN ABOVE NORMAL. A HEAT ADVISORY
IS NOT ANTICIPATED.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE REMAINS ENTRENCHED OVER 
THE REGION AND WILL SEE LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PATTERN.  
THEREFORE...CONTINUE HOT...HUMID CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON WITH HEAT 
INDICES REACHING AROUND 105 DECREES AGAIN OVER PORTIONS OF THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY.  A HEAT ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT TODAY IN THIS 
AREA.  THE CENTRAL VALLEY IS EXPECTED TO REMAIN JUST BELOW ADVISORY 
CRITERIA...SO FOR NOW...WILL NOT EXPAND THE CURRENT ADVISORY BUT 
WILL MONITOR TEMP AND DEW POINT THIS AFTERNOON.  HOWEVER...WILL 
REISSUE SPS FOR THE EXPECTED HIGH HEAT INDEX ACROSS THE ENTIRE MRX 
CWA.  CONVECTIVE POTENTIAL REMAINS UNCHANGED WITH GENERALLY A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF AN OROGRAPHICALLY INDUCED STORM.

LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HUGE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM 
EASTERN ATLANTIC TO EASTERN PACIFIC. THIS WILL DOMINTE THE WEATHER 
FOR THE PERIOD. MAJOR QUESTION FOR THE FIRST PART OF THIS PERIOD IS 
WHEN THE FRONT WILL DROP THROUGH THE AREA AND WHAT EFFECT IT WILL 
HAVE. MODELS HAVE BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTANT WITH FRONT CROSSING AREA 
EARLIER ON FRIDAY THAN LATER. THIS WILL TEND TO KEEP TEMPS DOWN A 
FEW DEGREES, AND WILL ALSO TEND TO SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR SOME 
CONVECTION IN FAVORED TERRAIN AND FURTHER NORTH. PW VALUES ARE VERY 
HIGH, CONVECTIVE TEMPS ARE IN THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S, WITH 
FORECAST HIGHS WELL ABOVE THIS, AND LIS ARE WEAKLY TO MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE. ALL THINGS CONSIDERED, AM CONCERNED THAT EVEN WITH SLIGHT 
CHANCE AND LOW CHANCE POPS ON FRIDAY, ISOLATED NEAR-SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP IN THOSE ABOVE MENTIONED AREAS. WILL 
MENTION THIS IN THE HWO THIS MORNING. MAIN TSTM PROB WILL BE WINDS 
WITH INVERTED V SOUNDING IN THE LOW LAYERS. FREEZING LEVELS WILL BE 
AROUND 17K FEET AND THIS APPEARS TO BE TOO HIGH FOR LARGE HAIL, 
THOUGH BRIEF HEAVY RAIN COULD POSE A THREAT.

AFTER FRONT PASSES THROUGH AIRMASS STABILIZES AND THE REST OF THE 
PERIOD RETURNS TO HOT AND HUMID, THOUGH NOT AS HIGH OF HEAT INDEX 
VALUES AS WEVE HAD. HAD LEFT FORECAST MAXES ALONE, BUT DID BUMP UP 
FRIDAY NIGHT MINS A DEGREE OR TWO.

.DISCUSSION...MINOR UPDATE TO AFTN FCST. DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED JUST SW OF MRX CWA AND FARTHER E THEN TUE. FREEZING LEVELS
ABOVE 18000 ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTH. BUMPED TEMPS UP A DEGREE OR 
TWO ACROSS VALLEY LOCATIONS. THESE MAX TEMPS REMAIN JUST A FEW 
DEGREES BELOW RECORD VALUES. HEAT ADVSRY AREA WILL REMAIN UNCHANGED 
BUT CRITERIA WILL BE THREATENED OUTSIDE ADVSRY AREA. WILL ADD ISOLD 
TSTMS ACROSS N 1/3 OF AREA TO ACCOUNT FOR WEAK TROUGH IN THE 
THICKNESS HEIGHTS AND HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE HOT 
TEMPERATURES AND CORRESPONDING HIGH HEAT INDICES.  EXPECT AFTERNOON 
HIGHS TO REACH INTO THE 90S ACROSS MUCH OF THE MRX CWA...WITH HIGH 
90S TO NEAR 100 POSSIBLE IN THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY.  DEW POINTS HAVE 
BEEN DROPPING INTO THE UPPER 60S IN THIS AREA DURING THE LATE 
AFTERNOON WHICH HAS HELPED KEEP THE HEAT INDEX BELOW ADVISORY 
CRITERIA.  HOWEVER...WITH THE STRENGTHENING HIGH AND TEMPS AND DEW 
POINTS SLOWLY INCREASING EACH DAY...MAY SEE A FEW AREAS REACH A HEAT 
INDEX OF 105 IN OUR SOUTHWESTERN COUNTIES AND WILL THEREFORE 
CONTINUE WITH THE HEAT ADVISORY FOR THIS LOCATIONS.  FOR THE REST OF 
THE AREA...AN SPS IS IN EFFECT WITH MANY PLACES EXPECTED TO SEE HEAT 
INDICES BETWEEN 100 AND 105.  AS FAR AS CONVECTION...AT BEST COULD 
SEE A STRAY STORM OVER EASTERN MOUNTAINS.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...NOT MUCH TO CHANGE FROM 
PREVIOUS FORECAST. DOG DAY RIDGE FROM ROUGHLY THE AZORES TO HAWAII. 
EXTREME HEAT, BUT NOT RECORD HEAT, WILL BE THE MAIN FORECAST 
CHALLENGE. ON FRIDAY, A FRONT MOVES THROUGH, WHICH, DEPENDING ON 
ITS TIMING, WILL EITHER KEEP AFTERNOON HIGHS DOWN A FEW DEGREES FROM 
THURSDAY, OR WILL ALLOW TEMP CONVERGENCE IN PRE-FROPA ENVIRONMENT 
FOR EVEN HIGHER HIGHS. AM BANKING ON FRONT MOVING THROUGH EARLIER IN 
THE DAY AND SO HIGHS WILL DROP A LITTLE FROM THURSDAYS. THIS WILL 
(HOPEFULLY) ELIMINATE THE NEED FOR A HEAT ADVISORY ON FRIDAY. IF, IN 
FACT, THE FRONT ARRIVES LATER IN THE DAY, IT WILL CERTAINLY RAISE 
THE SPECTER OF TEMPERATURE CONVERGENCE IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT AND 
HIGHS WILL BE RIGHT UP THERE AGAIN AND WE WILL HAVE TO ENTERTAIN THE 
IDEA OF A FURTHER HEAT ADVISORY. KEEPING AN OPEN MIND.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HOT TEMPERATURES
CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH READINGS IN
THE MID TO UPPER 90S IN SOUTHEAST TN AND 90 TO 95 ELSEWHERE EXCEPT
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLATEAU AND A FEW IN OTHER MOUNTAIN AREAS BUT COVERAGE IS
MINIMAL. BELIEVE SLIGHTLY HIGHER TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE REGION
WEDNESDAY AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER DEW POINTS WILL PUT THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY IN THE HEAT ADVISORY AREA WITH LOWS 75 AND ABOVE AND HEAT
INDEX VALUES AT 105 AND CONTINUE THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY. HAVE
ISSUED A HEAT ADVISORY EFFECTIVE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. THE MIDNIGHT
SHIFT WILL HAVE TO LOOK AT THE NEW GUIDANCE TO SEE IF THE ADVISORY
WILL STILL BE REACHED. THE DEW POINTS TODAY DROPPED INTO THE UPPER
60S BY MID AFTERNOON WHICH DROPPED THE HEAT INDECIES A FEW DEGREES.
IF THAT HAPPENS THE 105 HEAT INDEX VALUES MAY NOT OCCUR.

LOWER THAN ADVISORY CRITERIA. UPPER RIDGE STILL CENTERED OVER MS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE OVER THE 
AREA IN THE SHORT TERM...GIVING US A HAZY...HOT AND HUMID DAY 
TODAY.  WARM TEMPERATURES ALOFT COMBINED WITH LIMITED MOISTURE DEPTH 
AND LACK OF SIGNIFICANT TRIGGERS SHOULD KEEP CONVECTION LIMITED...SO 
WILL ONLY CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN HIGHER TERRAIN AND NORTH FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.  EXPECT HEAT INDEX VALUES TO REACH 
TO NEAR OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE 100 THIS AFTERNOON IN MANY LOCATIONS...BUT 
LOOKS LIKE WE WILL BE LOWER THAN ADVISORY CRITERIA. WILL CONTINUE 
SPS FOR NOW.  WILL GENERALLY TRIM MAV TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO FOR 
TODAY AS IT HAS BEEN RUNNING SLIGHTLY HIGH LATELY FOR MAX TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE EASTERN U.S. WILL SLOWLY SHIFT A BIT WESTWARD 
DURING THE WEEKEND...BUT WILL REMAIN THE DOMINATE WEATHER FEATURE 
ACROSS THE REGION.  LIMITED NORMAL SUMMERTIME CONVECTION PATTERN 
EXPECTED THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD.  THE BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION 
TO REACH INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL BE FRIDAY WHEN A VERY WEAK 
BOUNDARY MOVES THROUGH.  HOWEVER...THE MAIN WEATHER CONCERN FOR THE 
PERIOD CONTINUES TO BE THE HEAT.  WILL SEE CONTINUED HOT 
TEMPERATURE...WITH DEW POINTS IN THE UPPER 60S AND 70S FOR MUCH OF 
THE EXTENDED.  RESULTING HEAT INDEX IS EXPECTED TO REACH ABOVE THE 
CENTURY MARK ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON 
HOURS...AT LEAST THROUGH FRIDAY.  WILL CONTINUE WITH THE SPECIAL 
WEATHER STATEMENT TO HIGHLIGHT CONCERNS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1020 AM EDT MON AUG 6 2007

.DISCUSSION...HIGH CLOUDINESS MOVING AROUND THE PERIMETER OF THE 
UPPER RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES AND LOWER MS 
VALLEY GAVE THE FORECAST AREA A MILD NIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE MID TO 
UPPER 70S ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY. A FEW SHOWERS THIS 
MORNING FORMED IN THE EASTERN TN MOUNTAINS AND SW VA. BIGGEST 
QUESTION TODAY IS HOW HIGH WILL TEMPERATURES GO AND WHAT WILL HEAT 
INDEX VALUES BE. YESTERDAYS CLOUDS HELD TEMPERATURES DOWN ACROSS 
NORTH AND CENTRAL SECTIONS BUT NOT IN THE SOUTH. THINK THERE WILL BE 
LESS CLOUD COVER TODAY WITH THE HOTTEST TEMPERATURES CENTRAL AND 
SOUTH. ACROSS THE NORTH AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR. ADJUSTED HOURLY TEMPERATURES AND DEW 
POINTS UPWARD A COUPLE DEGREES TO MATCH CURRENT TRENDS. MAV GUIDANCE 
HAS DEW POINTS DROPPING INTO THE UPPER 60S MOST LOCATIONS BUT MET 
GUIDANCE KEEPS DEW POINTS IN THE LOWER 70S. I ADJUSTED HIGHS UP 
ABOUT A DEGREE CENTRAL AND SOUTH AND THINK HEAT INDEX VALUES WILL 
REACH OVER 100 THERE BUT IN THE 90 TO 100 RANGE IN AREAS FARTHER 
NORTH THIS AFTERNOON. UPDATE OUT SOON.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE OVER THE 
AREA IN THE SHORT TERM...GIVING US A HAZY...HOT AND HUMID DAY 
TODAY.  EXPECT HEAT INDEX VALUES TO BE MAINLY IN THE 95 TO 100 RANGE 
IN VALLEY LOCATIONS THIS AFTERNOON...BUT VALUES IN SOME LOCATIONS 
WILL MAKE IT OVER 100...ESPECIALLY SOUTH.  DESPITE WARM TEMPS 
ALOFT...SHOULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY SOME MINOR TWEAKS.     

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HAZY...HOT AND HUMID WEATHER 
WILL BE THE NORM DURING MUCH OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST AS HIGH 
PRESSURE EXTENDS NORTH AND EAST INTO THE REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL WHILE THE CHANCE FOR A 
COOLING SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM WILL BE MINIMAL AND LIMITED TO THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN UNTIL FRIDAY/SATURDAY WHEN A COOL FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
SLIP STEADILY SOUTH INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. USED SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE FORECAST AREA 
FOR THIS POSSIBILITY AS UPPER TROF ESTABLISHES ITSELF AGAIN ACROSS 
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. BY SUNDAY...MAINTAINED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1105 AM EDT SUN AUG 5 2007

.DISCUSSION...

LATE MORNING UPDATE TO INCREASE CLOUD COVER AND LOWER MAX 
TEMPERATURES FOR THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.

A SHORT-WAVE MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE OHIO VALLEY
INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS IS PRODUCING AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS OVER EAST KENTUCKY. SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WILL SEE INCREASE COVERAGE OF STORMS BY NOON AS
THE WAVE MOVES JUST NORTH OF THE AREA. HAVE INCREASED POPS FOR
THESE AREAS FOR THE REST OF THE DAY. ELSEWHERE...ISOLATED TO WIDELY
SCATTERED STORMS DUE TO THE MOIST AND UNSTABLE CONDITIONS WITH
GREATEST COVERAGE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

HAVE ALSO INCREASED CLOUD COVER...ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST SECTIONS. 

&&

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SOME HIGH CLOUDS MOVING IN 
ESPECIALLY NORTH ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY.  THIS SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY WILL PASS BY TO OUR NORTH...BUT WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO 
WARRANT SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS NORTH.  INSTABILITY NOT 
IMPRESSIVE...BUT EXPECT MORE IN THE WAY OF CONVECTION TODAY THAN 
YESTERDAY.  WILL GO WITH LOW CHANCE POPS NORTH...SLIGHT CHANCE 
SOUTH.  WILL KEEP SOME LOW POPS INTO EARLY EVENING HOURS...THEN DRY 
LATER ON TONIGHT.  WILL MAKE A FEW TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS...BUT OVERALL 
THEY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW 
BUILDING HEIGHTS THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM. DID NOT CHANGE 
FORECAST THROUGH THIS PERIOD WHICH FEATURES SOMEWHAT OF AN EMPHASIS 
ON POSSIBLE CONVECTION ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE...ESPECIALLY MONDAY AS MODELS CONTINUE TO BRING WEAK 
DISTURBANCES ACROSS THIS REGION PRIOR TO UPPER RIDGE FULLY 
ESTABLISHING ITSELF. KEPT OROGRAPHIC POPS GOING ACROSS MAJOR TERRAIN 
FEATURES THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST WHICH FAVORS A SLIGHT 
DRIER REGIME FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF 
UPPER RIDGE. CONCERNING TEMPERATURES STAYED CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE 
BLEND EARLY IN THE PERIOD WHILE USING NUMBERS A LITTLE LOWER THAN 
SUGGESTED MID TO LATE WEEK.

1007 AM EDT SAT AUG 4 2007

.DISCUSSION...FOG IS SLOWLY DISSIPATING GIVING WAY TO HAZY 
CONDITIONS. DESPITE THE HAZE...PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY ALLOWING FOR 
TEMPERATURES TO WARM BETWEEN 90 AND 95 DEGREES ACROSS MOST OF THE 
VALLEY PRODUCING HEAT INDICES RANGING FROM 95 TO 100 DEGREES.

UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH 
RISING HEIGHTS AND THICKNESS. WARMER TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL HELP 
LIMIT AREAL EXTENT OF CONVECTION TODAY...BUT SOUNDINGS SHOW PLENTY 
OF ENERGY FOR STORM DEVELOPMENT. FORECAST CAPES ARE AROUND 2000 J/KG.
DUE TO CONTINUED DRY AIR AT MID-LEVELS...DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WILL BE 
MAIN CONCERN...PER HWO.

PLAN ON LEAVING FORECAST INTACT.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NAM AND GFS FAIRLY CLOSE THROUGH 
THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NAM SHOWING A LITTLE MORE 
MOISTURE.  HAVE LEANED THAT WAY IN PRECIPITATION FORECAST AND HAVE 
INCREASED POPS FOR TODAY AND EARLY EVENING BASED ON PAST FEW DAYS 
COVERAGE.  TEMPERATURES ARE CLOSE AND BASICALLY WENT WITH A BLEND 
FOR GUIDANCE.  

ATMOSPHERE AGAIN VERY UNSTABLE WITH TYPICALLY ISOLATED SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STAYED WITH SLIGHT AND LOW 
CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AS MODELS TRY TO BRING THE TAIL END OF WEAK 
WAVE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPPING A LITTLE CLOSER 
TO NORTHERN PORTION OF MRX FORECAST AREA IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
POSSIBLY GENERATING A COUPLE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. 
ON MONDAY NORTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES AROUND GRADUALLY STRENGTHENING 
RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WHICH MODELS HINT MAY BRING ANOTHER 
WEAK VORT SOUTHEAST ACROSS THIS SAME PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA 
ALTHOUGH GRADUALLY TAPER PROBABILITY IN THIS AREA. FOR MUCH OF THE 
REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD REMOVED POPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
GREAT VALLEY AND SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA AS MAJOR LEAGUE 
UPPER RIDGE PROGGED TO FIND A HOME OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF 
THE NATION. STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR OROGRAPHIC 
CONVECTION DURING THIS PERIOD. TRIED TO FOLLOW THERMONUCLEAR WARMING 
TREND SUGGESTED BY MEX MOS TO ACCOUNT FOR SUBSIDENCE UNDER UPPER 
RIDGE BUT AM A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT MAXES/MINS MAY BE A BIT ON THE 
HIGH SIDE SO UNDERCUT THE NUMBERS BY A DEGREE OR TWO.

THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH THE EXCEPTION OF NAM SHOWING A LITTLE MORE 
MOISTURE.  HAVE LEANED THAT WAY IN PRECIPITATION FORECAST AND HAVE 
INCREASED POPS FOR TODAY AND EARLY EVENING BASED ON PAST FEW DAYS 
COVERAGE.  TEMPERATURES ARE CLOSE AND BASICALLY WENT WITH A BLEND 
FOR GUIDANCE.  

ATMOSPHERE AGAIN VERY UNSTABLE WITH TYPICALLY ISOLATED SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STAYED WITH SLIGHT AND LOW 
CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AS MODELS TRY TO BRING THE TAIL END OF WEAK 
WAVE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPPING A LITTLE CLOSER 
TO NORTHERN PORTION OF MRX FORECAST AREA IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
POSSIBLY GENERATING A COUPLE OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES IN OUR NEIGHBORHOOD. 
ON MONDAY NORTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES AROUND GRADUALLY STRENGTHENING 
RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WHICH MODELS HINT MAY BRING ANOTHER 
WEAK VORT SOUTHEAST ACROSS THIS SAME PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA 
ALTHOUGH GRADUALLY TAPER PROBABILITY IN THIS AREA. FOR MUCH OF THE 
REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD REMOVED POPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
GREAT VALLEY AND SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA AS MAJOR LEAGUE 
UPPER RIDGE PROGGED TO FIND A HOME OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF 
THE NATION. STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR OROGRAPHIC 
CONVECTION DURING THIS PERIOD. TRIED TO FOLLOW THERMONUCLEAR WARMING 
TREND SUGGESTED BY MEX MOS TO ACCOUNT FOR SUBSIDENCE UNDER UPPER 
RIDGE BUT AM A LITTLE CONCERNED THAT MAXES/MINS MAY BE A BIT ON THE 
HIGH SIDE SO UNDERCUT THE NUMBERS BY A DEGREE OR TWO.

OVER SOUTHERN PLAINS MOVES SLOWLY EAST TO THE LOWER MS VALLEY
MONDAY TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHEAST TUESDAY THROUGH
THURSDAY WITH SOME RETROGRADING TO THE WEST POSSIBLE FRIDAY. A
WEAK FRONT IN THE OHIO VALLEY MOVING EAST WILL SEND AN IMPULSE
SOUTHEAST AROUND THE PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE WHICH SHOULD AFFECT THE
FORECAST AREA SUNDAY. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL
BE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST HALF. AS THE RIDGE MOVES OVERHEAD MONDAY.
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MORE ISOLATED AND MAY ONLY OCCUR
OVER THE MOUNTAINS. WILL KEEP 20 PERCENT IN ALL AREAS FOR NOW BUT
LATER SHIFTS MAY WANT TO TAKE POPS OUT OF THE VALLEYS. HIGH
TEMPERATURES WILL STAY IN THE LOWER TO MID 90S WITH PERSISTENCE THE

.DISCUSSION...EARLY MORNING FOG IS DISSIPATING GIVING WAY TO MOSTLY
SUNNY SKY. AREA SOUNDINGS SHOW AIRMASS WILL BE QUITE UNSTABLE THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH CAPES APPROACHING 3000 J/KG WITH LIS OF
-6 TO -7...SO PLENTY OF ENERGY FOR CONVECTION. MAIN FORCING WILL
REMAIN LOCAL TERRAIN. CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURE IS AROUND 90
DEGREES...SO THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL AROUND
2 PM...SIMILAR TO YDAS.

SOUNDINGS AND WATER VAPOR SHOWS MID-LEVEL DRY AIR WITH MDPI AROUND
1 OR GREATER...SO DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE A
CONCERN THIS AFTERNOON. WBZ ARE NEAR 12 KFT...WHICH IS HIGH...BUT
ENOUGH UPDRAFT ENERGY TO PRODUCE MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL WITH THE
STRONGEST STORMS. GIVEN CONTINUED HIGH PWS...LOCALLY TORRENTIAL
RAINFALL AND LOCALIZED FLOODING ARE ALSO A CONCERN. HAVE UPDATED
HWO TO REFLECT A RISK OF SEVERE WEATHER.

HAVE UPPED POPS TO 30-40 PERCENT FOR HIGHER TERRAIN AND 20 PERCENT
FOR THE VALLEY. TEMPERATURE FORECAST LOOKS GOOD.  HEAT INDICES WILL RANGE
FROM THE MID 90S TO NEAR 100 DEGREES.

HAVE A GOOD DAY...

DOES TRY TO BRING CENTER OF UPPER RIDGE OVER THE REGION BY MID WEEK.

305 PM EDT THU AUG 2 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)... VERY LITTLE CHANGE IS
EXPECTED IN THE WEATHER PATTERN OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS...SO A
PERSISTENCE FORECAST WILL BE FOLLOWED. THE USUAL AFTERNOON
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE MOUNTAINS...PLATEAU...AND
ELEVATED AREAS OF SW VA. THE MOVEMENT OF THE STORMS IS GENERALLY TO
THE EAST...SO SOME OF THE STORMS IN THE PLATEAU COULD MOVE INTO THE
VALLEY THIS EVENING. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE
VALLEY...WITH A CHANCE IN THE MTNS/PLATEAU/SW VA. ALL STORMS SHOULD
DISSIPATE BY MIDNIGHT. EXPECT PATCHY FOG AGAIN IN AREAS THAT
RECEIVE A SHOWER. TOMORROW LOOKS LIKE A CARBON COPY OF TODAY...WITH
HIGHS IN THE 90 TO 95 RANGE AND ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
IN THE AFTERNOON IN THE FAVORED AREAS. A MIDLEVEL RIDGE TO THE WEST
DOES BUILD INTO THE AREA SLIGHTLY TOMORROW...WHICH MAY SUPPRESS
CONVECTION A TAD MORE THAN TODAY.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN
PATTERN FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WITH RIDGING OVER THE
SOUTH CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST STATES. CONVECTION SHOULD STAY OVER THE
MOUNTAIN AREAS WITH LITTLE COVERAGE ELSEWHERE. WILL HAVE POPS AT
15 TO 20 PERCENT WHICH IS ABOVE GUIDANCE BUT FELT PERSISTENCE WAS
BETTER. RIDGE DOES STRENGTHEN A LITTLE SATURDAY BUT NAM/WRF STILL
SHOWS ACTIVITY DEVELOPING OVER THE MOUNTAINS. GFS SHOWS A WEAK
SHORT WAVE MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY SO KEPT SLIGHTLY
HIGHER CHANCE NORTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH. UPPER RIDGE STAYS
STRONG MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY THURSDAY SO HAVE 30 PERCENT CHANCE NORTH. FOLLOWING CLOSER
TO THE NAM/WRF GUIDANCE FOR LOWS AND HIGHS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT.
PERSISTENCE WOULD BE THE BEST WAY TO PUT IT FOR THE REMAINDER OF
THE FORECAST WITH HIGHS AND LOWS VERY CLOSE TO THE LAST FEW DAYS

EXPECT THAT TODAY WILL BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...WITH SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING OVER THE MOUNTAINS...PLATEAU..AND SW VA
THIS AFTERNOON. A FEW COULD BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE AS LOW LEVEL
LAPSE RATES ARE QUITE STEEP. YESTERDAY THE STEERING FLOW WAS EAST

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION HAS BEEN
SLOWLY DRIFTING EAST OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS. THE PRESENCE OF THIS
RIDGE MAY INFLUENCE OUR AREA BY SUPPRESSING AFTERNOON CONVECTION A
LITTLE MORE THAN YESTERDAY. HOWEVER WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS AROUND
70 IN THE VALLEY AND PLENTY OF SURFACE HEATING THIS MORNING...THERE
SHOULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THE BEST
CHANCES LOOK TO BE IN ELEVATED AREAS OF THE MOUNTAINS SINCE THE
FLOW ALOFT IS WEAK. 1000-850 MB THICKNESS IS A LITTLE GREATER THAN
YESTERDAY..SO EXPECT HIGH TEMPS ABOVE YESTERDAYS HIGHS...MAINLY IN
THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S. TEMPS MAY NEED TO BE NUDGED UPWARD IN
SOME SPOTS. WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST TO REMOVE FOG AND AFTERNOON
WORDING.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)......WEAK SHORTWAVE ROTATING 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...OROGRAPHICS AND MORE 
THAN SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY GENERATING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. HELD SOME 
SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITIES INTO THE EVENING FOR LEFTOVER CONVECTION 
EARLY IN THE FIRST PERIOD. MODELS TRY TO BRING IN HIGHER PRESSURE 
DURING THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS WITH A VERY GRADUAL DROP IN MEAN RH. 
MODELS HAVENT BEEN DOING THE BEST WITH CONVECTION DURING SEVERAL 
SHIFTS I HAVE WORKED THIS SUMMER WITH RATHER POOR UNDERFORECASTING 
DEFICIENCIES. MODEL INSTABILITY PROGGED TO BE SUFFICIENT FOR AT 
LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON BOTH TUESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY. COULD CARRY THIS AREA WIDE BUT THIS COULD LEAD TO 
OVERFORECASTING COVERAGE AND WILL JUST KEEP CONVECTION IN THE MAJOR 
TERRAIN AREAS DUE TO ADDITIONAL HELP FROM OROGRAPHIC LIFT. 
CONCERNING TEMP FORECAST STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE GUIDANCE BLEND. 
HOWEVER...EDGED A LITTLE HIGHER ON MINIMUMS NIGHT PERIODS AND A 
LITTLE LOWER DAYTIME PERIODS DUE TO MOISTURE BOTH IN THE GROUND AND 
LINGERING IN THE LOWER ATMOSPHERE IN THE GASEOUS STATE. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THRU MONDAY)...THE UPPER TROF WHICH IMPACTED
THE AREA MUCH OF NEXT WEEK IS FINALLY WEAKENING AND MOVING OFF TO THE
EAST AND HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING BACK IN FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL
BRING A DRIER AND WARMER AIRMASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SOME SHOWER
ACTIVITY BEGINNING MAINLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THEN SLOWLY
SPREADING INTO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND BY THE WEEKEND ACROSS THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA AS THE STANDARD AFTERNOON AND EVENING
CONVECTION.

SEEM TO STILL BE IN THE VICINITY OF SE TN...GIVEN DEW POINT TEMPS 
FROM 13Z SURFACE PLOTS. SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR NOTED ACROSS THE NRN TWO 
THIRDS OF TN IN GENERAL...ALTHO A LOT OF MOISTURE NOTED FROM 12Z 
SOUNDINGS. A SLIGHT DECREASE IN PRECIPITABLE WATER ON LATEST OHX AND 
RNK SOUNDINGS...PLUS UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN JUST A BIT INTO MIDDLE 
TN HAS RESULTED IN MUCH LESS INSTABILITY THAN PAST SEVERAL DAYS. 
MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING FOR M/U 80S YIELDED CAPES OF LESS 500 
J/KG...WHILE RNK SOUNDING GENERATED GREATER THAN 1000 J/KG.

GIVEN LACK OF UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT EXPECT MOSTLY DIURNAL CONVECTION 
TODAY...DEVELOPING ONCE WE REACH MID TO UPR 70S. LOCATION OF WEAK 
FRONT AND EXPECTED WEAK CONVERGENCE IN HIGHER TERRAIN OF EASTERN 
MOST FORECAST AREA...SUPPORTS SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS THOSE SECTIONS.
WILL MONITOR RADAR TRENDS BEFORE INCREASING POPS ANY IN THE ERN MTNS

327 PM EDT SAT JUL 28 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE BOUNDARY MOST 
NOTABLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA IS A WARM FRONT ALMOST CUTTING THE 
AREA IN HALF FROM SW TO NE. SHOWERS HAVE POPPED RANDOMLY BEHIND THE 
WARM FRONT WHERE AIRMASS HAS DESTABILIZED...WITH ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY TO DEVELOP SHORTLY. KEPT POPS AT 50 PERCENT IN 
THESE AREAS...BUT LOWERED SLIGHTLY NE OF THE WARM FRONT WHERE MORE 
STABLE CONDITIONS LINGER. DUE TO WEAK COLD AND WARM FRONTS KEPT AT 
LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN LATE TONIGHT. FAVORED PERSISTENCE 
OVER MOS CHOICES FOR MINS TONIGHT. 

FOR SUNDAY...WEAK LOW PRESSURE ALONG FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOOKS TO SET 
UP BEST (BUT WEAK) CONVERGENCE IN HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG TN-NC STATE 
LINE FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THUS...INCREASED POPS THOSE 
AREAS TO LOWER END OF LIKELY WHICH ALSO MESHED BETTER WITH POP/WX
GRIDS FROM GSP AND RNK. MOS HIGHS PROBABLY A BIT TOO WARM GENERALLY 
ON SUNDAY...ESPECIALLY NRN AND ERN AREAS...SO SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT MOS.

SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...POPS GRADUALLY DIMINISH FROM THE W-NW AS 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY FINALLY SLIPS SE OF THE FORECAST AREA ON 
MONDAY. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS DEPICTED THIS WELL...SO LITTLE 
CHANGES MADE TO SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY. AGAIN WENT WITH PERSISTENCE 
ON SUNDAY NIGHT MINS AND A MOS BLEND ON MAX TEMPS MONDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...PERSISTANT EAST COAST 
UPPER TROF SLIPS FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA TO ALLOW FOR 
SEVERAL DAYS OF LITTLE OR NO PROBABILITY OF PRECIP DUE TO THE 
INTRODUCTION OF NORTHERLY COMPONENT TO THE FLOW AS WELL AS HIGHER 
PRESSURES AND SUBSIDING AIR. LOW LEVEL AIRMASS GRADUALLY MOISTENS 
MID TO LATE WEEK AS MOISTURE ADVECTION DEVELOPS AGAIN FROM THE 
ATLANTIC AND GULF OF MEXICO. ALSO UPPER TROF NEVER REALLY MOVES FAR 
ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA SO MAINTAINED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR OROGRAPHIC DEVELOPMENT 
LEAVING MUCH OF THE GREAT VALLEY DRY. BY SATURDAY USED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA WITH LOW CHANCE POPS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS AS ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES TO SLOWLY MOISTEN AND DESTABILIZE. 
STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS WHICH FEATURE A WARMING TREND WITH 
INCREASED INSOLATION AND A LITTLE SUBSIDENCE TO BOOT.

959 AM EDT SAT JUL 28 2007

.DISCUSSION...REMNANTS OF CONVECTIVE COMPLEX HAVE EXITED SE TN INTO 
NW GA...LEAVING SOME MINOR WATER PROBLEMS IN THE URBAN AND SMALL 
STREAM FLOOD ADVISORY COUNTIES (MARION...HAMILTON AND SEQUATCHIE).
FORTUNATELY THE MOVEMENT WAS FAST ENOUGH TO GET THESE HEAVY RAINS 
OUT SOON ENOUGH TO AVOID ANY SIGNIFICANT FLOODING. RADAR ESTIMATES 
OF 1.5 TO 2.5 INCHES PER HOUR WERE CONFIRMED BY AN OBSERVER IN 
HAMILTON COUNTY WHO MEASURED OVER 2 INCHES OF RAIN IS JUST UNDER 1 
HOUR THIS MORNING. CHA AIRPORT ALSO RECORDED OVER 2 INCHES OF RAIN
WITH MOST FALLING AFTER 8AM EDT (12Z).

QUESTION NOW IS HOW MUCH CONVECTION RE-DEVELOPS THIS AFTERNOON...
WITH STABLE AIRMASS BEHIND THIS MORNINGS ACTIVITY. MODIFIED 12Z OHX 
AND RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW MUCH LESS INSTABILITY (POSITIVE CAPES OF 800 
TO 1200 J/KG AND -3 LIFTED INDEX) IF MAX TEMPS REACH THE 80S. AGREE 
WITH PREVIOUS SHIFT THAT SCATTERED WORDING AND 50 PERCENT POPS 
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT.

WILL UPDATE ZFPMRX...FRESHEN GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS SHORTLY.

230 AM EDT SAT JUL 28 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
ALONG IT OVER SOUTHERN INDIANA. RADARS REVEAL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF 
LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN WITH SOME EMBEDDED THUNDER OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA...ASSOCIATED WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THIS SHORT WAVE EXITING THE FORECAST AREA BY LATER 
THIS MORNING...WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING IN THE 
AFTERNOON. WITH THIS COLD FRONT REMAINING NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON...THINK THAT CONVECTION SHOULD AGAIN REDEVELOP AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT...ALTHOUGH THIS MORNINGS RAIN SHOULD KEEP COVERAGE 
ONLY SCATTERED IN NATURE. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE LOWER 
THAN GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS WITH HIGHS TODAY (DUE TO EXTENSIVE CLOUD 
COVER AND SCATTERED PRECIP)...AND WILL TREND TOWARDS PERSISTENCE 
WITH LOWS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...REALLY NOTHING AT ALL HAS 
CHANGED SINCE THE LAST DISCUSSION...SO WILL PARAPHRASE THE FEW 
CHANGES MADE TO THIS PORTION OF CURRENT PACKAGE. UPPER TROF OVER 
NORTHEASTERN U.S MOVES ONLY SLOWLY OUT OF THE PICTURE THROUGH 
FRIDAY. EFFECTS ON THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
WILL BE MOSTLY FROM SUNDAY THROUGH THE WEE HOURS OF MONDAY. 
SHORTWAVE ROTATES AROUND UPPER LOW THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY PRODUCING 
A WEAK FRONT...WHICH WILL DROP INTO THE REGION. SLOW DEPARTURE OF 
WEAKENING UPPER TROF STALLS FRONTAL MOVEMENT...BUT LAYER HUMIDITY 
BEGINS TO DRY...SO GRADUALLY DECREASED POPS FOR CONVECTION ON MONDAY 
WITH IMPROVEMENT FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST AS FRONT DROPS OUT OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. INDICATIONS OF A WEAK BACK DOOR FRONT MIDWEEK... 
WHICH WILL PRODUCE A DRIER NORTHERLY FLOW AT THE SURFACE...SO 
DROPPED POPS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. UPPER RIDGE OVER WRN/CENTRAL 
U.S. NEVER REALLY DOES IMPRESS MUCH AND WONT BUDGE EASTWARD 
THURS/FRI...AND THIS ALLOWS NEXT CANADIAN LOW TO PRESS ITS WAY DOWN 
THE EAST SIDE OF RIDGE. LOBE ON THIS LOW WILL CREATE SOME 
NORTHWESTERLY LOW-LEVEL FLOW...WHICH IN TURN WILL CAUSE WEAK UPSLOPE 
INTO BLUE RIDGE...WHICH IN TURN WILL RAISE POPS THOSE DAYS TO ABOUT 
SLIGHT CHANCE. MADE VARIOUS TWEAKS IN MAX/MIN TEMPS AND RESULTING 
TEMP PROGRESSION...SIMPLY TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH LATEST MODEL 
BLENDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX/CLUSTER TO DEVELOP LATE THIS EVENING AND TRACK SE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY MORNING. PREVIOUS FORECAST 
GRIDS DEPICTED THIS SCENARIO...BUT I DID SLIGHTLY RAISE POPS EITHER 
SIDE OF 12Z SATURDAY. STILL A CHANCE OF SOME MORE CONVECTIVE 
PRECIPITATION (PCPN) SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT...BUT SEEMS THAT MOST SIGNIFICANT RAINS WILL OCCUR LATE 
TONIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY. 

MOSTLY DIURNAL CONVECTION SATURDAY EVENING AND SUNDAY...WITH LITTLE 
CHANGES MADE TO FORECAST GRIDS AT THIS POINT. FAVORED CLOSER TO MOS 
BLEND FOR MINS TONIGHT...WHICH IS CLOSER TO PERSISTENCE AND BETTER 
THAN MOS LATELY. MESOSCALE COMPLEX MAKES SATURDAY HIGHS TRICKY...
BUT PCPN MAY DIMINISH AND ENOUGH CLEARING TO SUPPORT WARMER MAXES IN 
THE SOUTH...BUT CLOSER TO JUST UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S IN THE NORTH.
MOS BLEND LOOKED GOOD FOR SATURDAY NIGHT MINS...THEN GFS NUMBERS FOR 
SUNDAY MAXES.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROF/LOW IN NO 
HURRY TO EXIT THE NORTHEASTERN U.S THROUGH THE LONG TERM FORECAST 
WITH IMPACT ON THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS EARLY 
IN THE PERIOD. SHORTWAVE FEATURE ROTATES AROUND UPPER LOW THROUGH 
THE OHIO VALLEY INDUCING SURFACE WAVE ON SYNOPTIC SCALE FRONT 
DROPPING INTO THE REGION. WAVE SLOWS FRONTAL PROGRESS SO MAINTAINED 
IDEA OF LOW AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION ON MONDAY WITH 
IMPROVEMENT FROM NORTH TO SOUTH AS FRONT DROPS FURTHER SOUTH THROUGH 
THE FORECAST AREA. STAYED WITH THE DRY FORECAST FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY AS NORTHERLY COMPONENT TO LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS WITH 
SURFACE RIDGE BUILDING SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. USED SOME 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE TERRAIN ALONG NORTH CAROLINA BORDER FOR 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WHERE MODELS SHOW SOME INSTABILITY WITH MOISTURE

.DISCUSSION...MODIFYING 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS FOR MAX TEMPS IN 
THE 80S TO LOWER 90S YIELDS MODERATE TO STRONG INSTABILITY TODAY
(POSITIVE CAPE OF 2000 TO 3500 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES OF AT LEAST 
-8 DEGS C).  HOWEVER...THE CLOSED UPPER LOW HAS STAYED WELL TO OUR 
NORTH...WITH SLIGHTLY WARMER MID LEVEL TEMPS PER 12Z UPPER AIR 
ANALYSIS.  SATELLITE PICS AND ANALYSIS DOES INDICATE A WEAK JET MAX 
DROPPING DOWN THE BACK SIDE OF THE UPPER LOW TOWARD THE CENTRAL AND 
SRN APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING...AND THERE IS SOME ENHANCED 
CONVECTION UNDERWAY ACROSS CENTRAL AND ERN KY.

CONVECTION MAY GET AN EARLIER START TODAY GIVEN MUCH LESS FOG AND 
LOW LEVEL CLOUDINESS THAN YESTERDAY.  HOWEVER...LACK OF A SURFACE 
FEATURE TO FOCUS DEVELOPMENT SUGGESTS THAT CHANCE POPS WITH 
SCATTERED WORDING IS SUFFICIENT.  OHX SOUNDING SHOWED FREEZING LEVEL 
AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS BOTH A LITTLE HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY...SO
HAIL THREAT IS PROBABLY TOWARD THE LOWER END OF SEVERE.  ISOLATED 
SEVERE STORMS WITH DAMAGING WINDS IN EXCESS OF 50 MPH WILL BE MAIN 
THREAT.

315 AM EDT FRI JUL 27 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A 
WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THIS COLD FRONT WILL QUICKLY MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY BY LATE TONIGHT...DUE TO NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS SHOULD DEVELOP AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON... 
BUT WITH A LACK OF A DECENT FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR CONVECTION... 
THINK THAT MAINLY TERRAIN-INDUCED CONVECTION SHOULD DEVELOP. MODELS 
KEEP HINTING THAT A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX (MCC) WILL DEVELOP 
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT TODAY OVER THE MIDWEST...AND THEN QUICKLY 
MOVE SOUTHEAST TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA BY LATER TONIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY MORNING. THE GFS AND WRF MODELS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES 
WITH THE DEVELOPMENT AND ULTIMATE MOVEMENT OF THIS MCC...BUT THEY 
BOTH AGREE THAT ITS ASSOCIATED UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE SHOULD MOVE 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING. 
THUS...WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA FOR TONIGHT...AND AREAWIDE ON SATURDAY. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT MID-LEVEL WINDS WILL ONLY BE AROUND 20-30 KTS WITH 
THIS MCC...BUT THINK THAT SOME DAMAGING WINDS COULD BE GENERATED 
SINCE MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A FAIRLY DEEP MID-LEVEL AND LOW-LEVEL 
DRY AIR MASS TO HELP ACCELERATE THE DOWNDRAFTS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
BASICALLY TREND TOWARD THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS WITH HIGHS THROUGH 
THE PERIOD...BUT WILL TREND TOWARD PERSISTENCE WITH LOWS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROF OPENS AND MOVES 
SLOWLY AWAY FROM THE AREA, BUT DRAGS A POSITIVELY TILTED LOBE BEHIND 
IT, WHICH IN TURN DEVELOPS A WEAK FRONT (MORE OF JUST A WEAK 
SURFACE TROF) ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY. THIS WILL ACT AS A FOCUSING 
MECHANISM FOR CONVECTION. LAYER MOISTURE NOT SUPER IMPRESSIVE, BUT 
LOW LEVEL DEWPOINTS STILL HIGH SO EXPECT SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. 
INDICATIONS ARE THAT STORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN AREAS MAY REACH SEVERE 
LEVELS WITH LIS AROUND -4, CONVECTIVE TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 80S,  
CAPES IN THE LOW 2000S, AND WIND VECTORS PRODUCING STORM MOTIONS 
SLIGHTLY TO THE RIGHT OF THE MEAN WIND. HAIL IS NOT (AT THIS TIME) 
EXPECTED TO BE LARGE, BUT WINDS COULD BE A PROBLEM, WITH RECENT 
RAINS HAVING MOISTENED THE GROUND IN MANY LOCATIONS THERE. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL BE NEAR 2 INCHES AND K VALUES UP 
AROUND 35 SO WITH SLOW MOVING STORMS, SOME LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINS 
COULD RESULT. URBAN AREAS SHOULD BE ON THE ALERT, ESPECIALLY. 

THE FRONT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH AND SLIGHT UPPER RIDGING BEGINS ON 
MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH DRIER AIR AND SUNNIER SKIES. LATER IN 
THE PERIOD A BACK DOOR FRONT IS HINTED AT BUT THIS IS SO FAR OUT IN 
TIME, IT IS NOT CERTAIN AT ALL.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...LACK OF SURFACE FEATURE TODAY 
HAS CONVECTION FIRING MORE RANDOMLY...ALTHO SOME ORGANIZED OVER THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND HIGHER TERRAIN OF WRN NC AT THIS TIME. 
MOVEMENT IS EAST OR NORTHEAST AT 10 TO 15 MPH...MOVING AWAY FROM TRI 
AND TYS FOR NOW...WITH SLIGHT THREAT OF TSRA FOR CHA OVER NEXT FEW 
HOURS. A FEW STORMS MAY PULSE TO BRIEFLY SEVERE LEVELS WITH SMALL 
HAIL AND DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS THE MAIN THREATS. DUE TO RANDOM 
LOOK DECIDED TO LOWER POPS A BIT FOR REST OF THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING HOURS (BELOW 50 PERCENT COVERAGE). CLOSE TO MOS BLEND FOR 
MIN TEMPS...AND ADDED SOME PATCHY LATE NIGHT FOG...WITH POTENTIAL 
FOR IFR CONDITIONS AT ALL 3 TAF SITES.

FOR FRIDAY...GENERALLY EXPECT DIURNAL CONVECTION WITH ONCE AGAIN A 
RANDOM COVERAGE. LATEST MOS POPS WERE LOWER THAN PREVIOUS GRIDS...
BUT I KEPT POPS A BIT HIGHER IN THE TYPICALLY FAVORED TERRAIN AREAS. 
GFS MAX TEMPS WERE NOT FAR OFF THE BLEND OF MOS...AND CLOSELY 
FOLLOWED. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH 
DEVELOPING ACROSS THE EASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION WILL BE THE MAIN 
WEATHER FEATURE FOR THE EXTENDED. MODELS SHOW A FAIRLY STRONG 
SHORT-WAVE DIVING INTO THE DEVELOPING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY LATE FRIDAY WHICH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY EARLY 
FRIDAY MORNING. THICKNESS AND CORFIDI VECTORS SUGGEST OHIO VALLEY 
MCS WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE FORECAST FRIDAY NIGHT. HAVE UPPED 
POPS FOR THIS FEATURE WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES OF CONVECTION OVER 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.

PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT AS UPPER TROUGH BECOMES MORE ESTABLISHED.  WILL KEEP 
LIKELY POPS FOR SATURDAY AND ..SO HAVE KEPT LIKELY POPS GOING.

FOR SUNDAY...UPPER TROUGH MOVES ONLY SLOWLY EAST TO THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...SO WILL ALSO KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING...HIGHEST POPS 
NORTHEAST SECTIONS.  SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE AREA 
FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...SO DRY CONDITIONS RETURN.

AREA WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION POSSIBLE. CONFIDENCE LOW FOR THIS 
FEATURE.

CLOUDS WERE LIFTING.

MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING FOR MAX TEMPS IN THE UPR 80S AND DEWPTS IN

POSITIVE CAPES OF 1500 TO 2000 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES OF -6 DEGREES.
COLDER TEMPS ALOFT ARE TO OUR NORTH CLOSER TO THE OHIO VALLEY/ERN 
GREAT LAKES UPPER LOW...SO FREEZING AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS DONT 
GENERALLY FAVOR HAIL THREAT TODAY.  ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS WITH 
STRONG DOWNBURST WINDS SEEMS TO BE MAIN THREAT TODAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LOW MOVING SLOWLY 
NORTHWEST AS MODELS HAVE ADVERTISED FOR SEVERAL DAYS. IT IS ALSO 
PROGGED TO START ITS NORTHEAST MOVEMENT BY VERY LATE TONIGHT. 
HOWEVER, IT IS NOT NOW PROGGED TO OPEN UP AS IT ONCE WAS AND IS 
STILL A CLOSED LOW AS IT STARTS MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. THIS 
MAKES ONLY A LITTLE DIFFERENCE IN THE FORECAST IN THAT IT KEEPS 
DRAGS A WEAK LITTLE WARM FRONT TOWARD THE AREA OVERNIGHT. THIS THING 
IS NOT REALLY DYNAMIC ENOUGH TO BRING WIDESPREAD ORGANIZED SEVERE 
WEATHER TO THE AREA, BUT AGAIN WILL PRODUCE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDER WITH ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS, MAINLY WITH A 
DAMAGING WIND THREAT AND SOME PENNY TO QUARTER HAIL EVENTS.

I HAVE ACTUALLY DROPPED POPS A LITTLE TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLIGHT 
LOWERING OF LAYER RH, AND THE PAUCITY OF CLOUDS AT THIS WRITING. 
HAVE ADDED MORNING PATCHY DENSE MORNING FOG, AND THIS WILL BURN OFF 
EARLY TURNING TO CUMULUS AND THEN TO TOWERING CU AND CBS PRETTY 
QUICKLY IN THE WARMTH OF THE AFTERNOON, MOSTLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN 
FIRST.

RAISED MAX TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO TODAY, AS WELL.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE
NORTHWESTERLY AS GREAT LAKES UPPER LOW SHIFTS EASTWARD. SCATTERED 
CONVECTION WILL BE MORE DIURNAL IN NATURE FRIDAY WITH LESS CLOUDS 
AND WARMER TEMPS. UPPED POPS FOR SAT AS PWS INCREASE TO ABOVE 2.00 
AND BULK SHEAR BECOMES RATHER IMPRESSIVE IN THE PREFRONTAL ZONE. 
BROAD SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREA PROGGED TO MOVE SE THROUGH MRX CWA

SRN MOST AREAS...WHICH ARE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE UPPER LOW.  

FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...CONVECTION SHOULD BE MORE DIURNAL
IN NATURE...BUT CANT RULE OUT ISOLATED CONVECTION JUST ABOUT
ANYTIME. PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS WERE REASONABLE WITH
SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS. AGAIN...FAVORED WARMER MOS MAX TEMPS FOR SRN
AREAS...AND A MOS BLEND FOR MIN TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS BRING FRONT 
INTO AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR BOTH 
PERIODS WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH WHERE THE BEST MOISTURE 
AND LIFT IS EXPECTED.  UPPER LOW LINGERS ON SUNDAY.  WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS GOING FOR SUNDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN OUR EASTERN

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
255 AM EDT WED JUL 25 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PERSISTENT UPPER LOW OVER OHIO. 
WEAK INVERTED TROF AT SFC FROM NEAR VICKSBURG TO LAKE ERIE, WITH 
WEAK SFC HIGH CENTERED NEAR SHENANDOAH VALLEY. SOME WEAK DRAINAGE 
WINDS WAFTING INTO TENNESSEE VALLEY AS A RESULT OF SFC HIGH. A SMALL 
AREA OF CONVERGENCE FORMED OVER SRN MID TN AND RESULTED IN SOME 
SHOWERS AND TSTMS DRIFTING SOUTHEAST TOWARD CHATTANOOGA. THESE WERE 
WEAKENING AT THIS WRITING, UPPER SUPPORT WAS ALSO WEAKER THIS FAR 
SOUTH. HOWEVER, ANOTHER SET OF SHOWERS/TSTMS WAS MOVING EAST OVER 
NORTHEAST TN AND THE ADJACENT VA BORDER, AND THIS AREA HAD A LITTLE 
GREATER UPPER SUPPORT IN THE FORM OF COLDER AIR ALOFT. LITTLE 
SERIOUS DYNAMICS IN EITHER AREA, SO LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND COOL 
AIR ALOFT THE DRIVING FORCES. THIS CANT LAST FOREVER.

FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT THE SITUATIONS ONLY REAL CHANGE WILL BE FOR 
THE UPPER OHIO LOW TO DRIFT SLOWLY TO THE NORTHWEST AND FILL IN 
SLIGHTLY. AT THE SFC, THE MAIN RESULT OF THIS WILL BE TO SHOVE A FEW 
ISOBARS AROUND WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN WIND DIRECTION OR STRENGTH.

HAVE KEPT WEATHER, CLOUDS, AND POPS MOSTLY THE SAME AS PREVIOUSLY, 
BUT HAVE TAKEN THE NEW BLEND OF GUIDANCE MAX TEMPS AND SLIGHTLY 
LOWERED THEM IN MOST AREAS AS THEY SEEMED TOO HIGH FOR THE CLOUDS 
AND RAIN TODAY. LEFT MINS ALONE TONIGHT.

AGAIN, AS YESTERDAY, MOST PLACES WILL NOT SEE MUCH RAIN, BUT THOSE 
WHO DO WILL GET BRIEF, ALBEIT MONSTROUS SHOWERS. DO NOT EXPECT 
FLOODING, ALTHOUGH IN HEAVILY URBANIZED AREAS SUCH AS DOWNTOWNS 
THERE COULD BE SOME MODERATELY PESTIFEROUS STREET FLOODING. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...ANOTHER WET DAY EXPECTED THU
AS SOUTHERN END OF UPPER LOW REMAINS OVER AREA. THE LOW SHIFTS NE ON FRI
AND AXIS MOVES EAST OF AREA WITH NW FLOW ALOFT. LAYER MOISTURE REMAINS
HIGH AS SURFACE RIDGE WEAKENS AND LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMES SLIGHTLY STRONGER
FROM THE SW. SO A GOOD CHC FOR CONVECTION CONTINUES. LAYER MOISTURE 
INCREASES ON SAT AND SUN AS COLD FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST
AND MOVES INTO AREA ON SUN. RAISED POPS AND CLOUD COVER AND LOWERED
TEMPS SAT. FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE SE OF AREA SUN NGT. FORECAST CALLS 
FOR A DRYING TREND AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
NOT A SURE THING THAT FRONT WILL COMPLETELY CLEAR THE AREA BUT
WILL ADJUST WITH LATER PACKAGES IN THE NEED ARISES.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING ALONG A 
MEMPHIS TO CINCINNATI LINE...WITH NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SCATTERED 
TSTORMS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS CONVECTION IS ASSOCIATED WITH A 
SHORT WAVE ROTATING AROUND AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE UPPER OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO ONLY SLOWLY DRIFT 
NORTHWEST OVERNIGHT...WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS CONTINUING 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...EXPECT SCATTERED CONVECTION 
TO CONTINUE OVERNIGHT.

WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST LATER THIS EVENING TO REMOVE 
EVENING WORDING AND MENTION SCATTERED CONVECTION OVERNIGHT. WILL 
ALSO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS 
PACKAGE. CURRENTLY SITS A WEAKENING SURFACE HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL 
APPS WITH CYCLONIC SURFACE FLOW OVER CENTRAL KY. SURFACE FLOW INTO 
SRN APPS TENDS TO BE CONFLUENT AND HAS BROUGHT INCREASING DEWPOINTS 
INTO AREA. WITH LOW DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS, AND QUASI-COLD AIR ALOFT 
IN UPPER TROF TO OUR NORTHEAST, LIFTED INDICES WILL STAY IN THE 0 TO 
-3 OR SO RANGE ALL NIGHT, AND THEN DROP AGAIN TO THE -2 TO -4 RANGE 
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL TEND TO KEEP SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS GOING 
PERIODICALLY ALL NIGHT AND INTO TOMORROW. MOST OF THE CELLS ARE 
MOVING AT LEAST 20 KNOTS AND SO FLOODING IS NOT LIKELY, EVEN WITH 
THE RECENT HEAVY RAINS WEVE HAD. STILL, THE SMALLEST, MOST 
INNOCUOUS LOOKING CELLS HAVE PRODUCED QUICK, BODACIOUS RAIN AMOUNTS. 
LOOK FOR MORE OF THAT OVER NIGHT AND AGAIN TOMORROW. MAX TEMPS ON 
THE COOL SIDE AND MINS NEAR NORMAL FOR A NICE FEELING.

.LONG RANGE (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MORE OF THE SAME 
THROUGH ABOUT FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS THE MODELS DEPICT THE NORTHEASTERN 
LOW RETROGRESSING SLIGHTLY TO THE NORTHWEST, WHICH KEEPS US IN THE 
LOW DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS AT THE SURFACE, AND QUASI-COOL AIR ALOFT. 
AS THE LOW OPENS UP AND MOVES TO THE NORTHEAST, WE GET SLIGHT 
RIDGING AND SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. HOWEVER, 
RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL RH WILL KEEP A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS/TSTM EVEN THAT 
FAR OUT. ITS NOT UNTIL MONDAY/TUESDAY THAT THE REAL DRYING OCCURS 
AND WE BEGIN TO SEE A RETURN TO MORE TYPICAL SUMMER DOG DAY PATTERNS.

246 PM EDT MON JUL 23 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...
UPPER LOW CURRENTLY CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN REGION
PER WV SATELLITE LOOP CONTINUES TO INFLUENCE WEATHER OVER MUCH OF
THE EASTERN CONUS. OCCASIONAL SHORT WAVES ROTATING AROUND THIS
FEATURE CONTINUE TO ENHANCE DEVELOPMENT OF MAINLY DIURNAL
CONVECTION. MODELS/SREF GENERALLY AGREE THAT THE UPPER LOW WILL
MOVE VERY LITTLE THROUGH THE BULK OF THE SHORT TERM. TIMING THE
INDIVIDUAL WAVES AROUND THIS FEATURE WILL REMAIN PROBLEMATIC.
LATEST WRF AND GFS GUIDANCE ADVERTISE LIKELY POPS FOR THE
NORTHEASTERN ZONES ON TUESDAY. HOWEVER...ONLY ABOUT 50 PERCENT OF
THE SREF MEMBERS ARE PROJECTING MEASURABLE PRECIP FOR THAT AREA
TOMORROW. THUS HAVE OPTED TO UNDERCUT MODEL GUIDANCE POPS SLIGHTLY
AND TO TRUNCATE POPS IN THE NORTHEAST ZONES AT HIGH CHANCE. FOR
TEMPS...GFS GUIDANCE VALUES APPEAR REASONABLE...ALBEIT HIGHLY
DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE/CLEARING THAT OCCURS IN THE
SHORT TERM.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN TAKING THE CLOSED LOW OVER THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TO THE NORTH-NORTHWEST...AND MERGING IT WITH 
PROGRESSIVE TROUGH ON FRIDAY. HOWEVER CONFIDENCE IN THE MODELS IS 
LOW FOR THE LONG TERM SINCE SUCH A PATTERN IS HIGHLY ANOMALOUS FOR 
THE MIDDLE OF SUMMER. WITH THE LOW POSITIONED TO THE NORTH...SEVERAL 
SHORTWAVES WILL ROTATE AROUND THE LOW AND AFFECT OUR AREA. UPPER 
DIFFLUENCE IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF A JET STREAK WILL SUSTAIN LIFT 
DESPITE WEAK INSTABILITY. THESE FEATURES ARE FAIRLY WEAK AND 
SUBTLE...BUT MOISTURE APPEARS PLENTIFUL...SO WILL HAVE POPS NO 
HIGHER THAN 60 PERCENT THROUGH THURSDAY. BEST CHANCES LOOK TO BE IN 
THE NORTH CLOSER TO THE LOW. FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...A RIDGE 
REMAINS OVER THE ROCKIES AND PLAINS WITH A TROUGH OVER THE EAST 
COAST. THIS WILL KEEP LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST. 
CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH AT THIS TIME TO PINPOINT ANY FEATURES 
THAT MAY BRING HIGHER POPS TO THE AREA.

BOUNDARY LAYER STARTING TO MOISTEN UP A BIT...ESPECIALLY SOUTH.  
WITH WEAK CONVERGENCE ASSOCIATED WITH THE INVERTED TROUGH ALONG WITH 
PROXIMITY OF UPPER LOW...WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TONIGHT IN

LEADS TO MORE INSTABILITY...SO WILL GO SLIGHT CHANCE ALL ZONES BUT 
SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST...WHERE WILL CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS.  WILL TWEAK 
MOST MAV TEMPS UP A BIT IN THE SHORT TERM...BUT NO MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS 
PLANNED.  


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES ARE NOW IN SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT. UPPER LOW EXPECTED 
TO MEANDER AROUND THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH MOST OF THE 
LONG TERM PERIOD. ANTICIPATE THAT THIS FEATURE WILL ENHANCE MOISTURE 
AND INSTABILITY SUFFICIENTLY TO PROMOTE SCATTERED...MAINLY DIURNAL 
CONVECTION EACH DAY THROUGH THE PERIOD. GENERALLY FAVORED THE 
ENSEMBLE MEAN GUIDANCE FOR POPS AND A BLEND OF GFS AND ENSEMBLE MEAN 
GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS. AT ANY RATE...APPEARS TEMPS WILL GENERALLY 
AVERAGE SLIGHTLY BELOW CLIMO THROUGH THE PERIOD AS THE NEGATIVE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE 
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST WILL CUT OFF TO OUR EAST AND 
NORTHEAST IN THE SHORT TERM.  ATMOSPHERE RATHER DRY OVER OUR AREA AT 
THE MOMENT...BUT MODELS TRYING TO BRING SOME MOISTURE IN FROM THE

UP...AND WHILE WITH COOLING ALOFT MAY BE ENOUGH WEAK INSTABILITY FOR

CONFIDENCE FOR THAT SO WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR NOW.  MAV TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE BOTH PERIODS...SO ONLY SOME MINOR TWEAKS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...STILL SOME NAGGING 
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE EVOLUTION OF THE UPPER LOW THAT MEANDERS OVER 
THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. 
GFS STILL EVENTUALLY RETROGRADES THIS FEATURE WESTWARD. PROXIMITY OF 
THIS FEATURE WOULD SUGGEST AN ENHANCEMENT IN BOTH MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY FOR OUR FORECAST AREA THROUGH MUCH OF THE UPCOMING WORK

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
THE MODELS HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES THROUGH THE SHORT TERM 
PERIOD...WITH THE GFS BEING MUCH DRIER TODAY AND SLOWER WITH THE 
FROPA ON FRIDAY. WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW THE NAM SOLUTION...WHICH HAS 
VERIFIED BETTER OF LATE. WITH PW VALUES AROUND 1.7...A UPPER LEVEL 
DEFORMATION ZONE SEEN IN WV IMAGERY OVER THE AREA...AND OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES LINGERING FROM CONVECTION TO THE NORTH...EXPECT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. SOME STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WILL 
AGAIN BE POSSIBLE. THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL 
PUSH SOUTH...AND MORE ORGANIZED CONVECTION ALONG A PRE-FRONTAL 
TROUGH SHOULD BEGIN TO ENTER NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. WILL BRING IN LIKELY POPS NORTH TONIGHT. THE NAM IS QUITE 
FAST WITH THE SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF THE TROUGH...AS IT SHOWS A 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BY 09Z AND DRIER AIR MOVING IN BY 12Z. WILL 
SLOW THIS DOWN A LITTLE AND CENTER THE HIGHEST POPS AROUND 12Z..WITH 
POPS LOWERING TO A CHANCE IN THE AFTERNOON. THE SURFACE COLD FRONT 
PUSHES THROUGH IN THE AFTERNOON...AND MUCH DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR 
SHOULD BE IN PLACE BY 00Z FRIDAY. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE 
SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA FRIDAY EVENING DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WITH 
THE TIMING OF THE FRONT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROF FINDS A HOME OVER THE EASTERN SEABOARD
DURING THE WEEKEND BEFORE SLOWLY WEAKENING WITH A GRADUAL SHIFT
AWAY FROM THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. TOWARD MIDWEEK. AT THE SURFACE
HIGHER PRESSURES BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THIS PATTERN WILL
ALLOW FOR A MAJOR LEAGUE DROP IN MEAN RH ALONG WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER
TEMPERATURES...AT LEAST EARLY IN THE PERIOD. BY MIDWEEK THE MERCURY
WILL CLIMB BACK ABOVE NORMAL AND HUMIDITY WILL SLOWLY BUILD. KEPT
CONVECTION OUT OF THE FORECAST AWAITING CONDITIONS MORE CONDUCIVE
TO DEVELOPMENT. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO MEX MOS TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE

822 PM EDT WED JUL 18 2007

.DISCUSSION...CONVECTION IN OUR FORECAST AREA HAS NEARLY DISSIPATED 
AT MID EVENING...ALTHO ONE SMALL AREA OF STRONG CONVECTION OVER EAST 
CENTRAL KY MAY VERY WELL HOLD TOGETHER TO REACH NE PLATEAU OF TN AND 
MUCH OF SW VA BEFORE MIDNIGHT.  LAPS DATA INDICATES GOOD INSTABILITY 
LINGERING TO TO THE SE OF THIS CONVECTION...SO MAY NEED TO CARRY LOW 
POPS FOR NRN AREAS A BIT LONGER...WHILE SHOULD BE SAFE TO REMOVE 
POPS ELSEWHERE WITH AN UPDATE.

SOME MUCH WELCOMED RAIN FELL IN SOME AREAS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING
...AND THERE MAY BE SOME LOW CLOUDINESS AND FOG DEVELOPING FOR TAF 
SITES (ESPECIALLY CHA AND TYS WHERE MORE SIGNIFICANT RAINS OCCURRED).
WILL FRESHEN HOURLY TEMP AND DEW POINT GRIDS WHICH HAVE DRIFTED OFF 
DUE TO SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

318 PM EDT WED JUL 18 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...QUITE A FEW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON...ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK 
SHORT WAVE.  WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS INTO THE EVENING...THEN GO DRY 
AFTER MIDNIGHT AS SHORT WAVE EXITS THE AREA.  MODELS INDICATE NOT 
MUCH IN THE WAY OF FORCING TOMORROW SO EXPECT LESS ACTIVITY...BUT 
STILL EXPECT ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE 
POPS ALL ZONES.  WILL ONLY MAKE SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS IN 
THE SHORT TERM.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
DIGGING SOUTH THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES THURSDAY NIGHT WITH A COLD 
FRONT MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. BOTH THE NAM/WRF AND GFS BRING 
THE PRE FRONTAL PRECIPITATION INTO THE NORTHWEST PART OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BEFORE 12Z FRIDAY WITH THE NAM/WRF SLIGHTLY FASTER. 
WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN THURSDAY NIGHT WITH LINGERING EVENING 
CONVECTION EARLY AND MORE MOVING IN AFTER MIDNIGHT. RAISED POPS TO 
LIKELY NW AND SE SECTIONS FRIDAY AS FRONT SLOWLY MOVES THROUGH. GFS 
SLOWING FRONT DOWN SOME FRIDAY SO HAVE POPS LINGERING INTO THE 
EVENING BEFORE ENDING. GREAT LAKES SURFACE HIGH MOVES IN SATURDAY 
WHICH WILL BRING DRIER AIR AND COOLER TEMPERATURES TO THE FORECAST 
AREA SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. UPPER TROUGH ALONG THE EAST COAST WILL 
ALSO DIG A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH. UPPER TROUGH MAY CLOSE OFF INTO 
UPPER LOW SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY OVER THE NORTHEAST STATES. AS 
HIGH PRESSURE MOVES EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS BY MID WEEK NORTHWEST FLOW 
WILL GUIDE STORMS TOWARD THE NORTHERN CWA WITH A CHANCE FOR MORE 
THUNDERSTORMS. UPPER LOW MAY FORM TO THE NORTH EARLY IN THE WEEK AND 
HELP ENHANCE THIS THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE 
SEVERAL DEGREES COOLER FRIDAY WITH CLOUDS AND RAIN SO WENT CLOSER TO 
MAV NUMBERS. FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY HIGHS AND LOWS WILL BE 
COOLER WITH DRIER HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL.

312 AM EDT WED JUL 18 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY IS BRINGING SHOWERS 
AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS TO WV. MOST OF THESE SHOWERS WILL PASS TO 
OUR NORTH. BEHIND THE TROUGH PASSAGE...THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL FLOW 
TURNS MORE TO THE WEST AND NORTHWEST...WHICH BRINGS DRIER AIR INTO 
THE AREA TODAY. THERE WILL STILL BE A DEFORMATION ZONE NEAR THE 
AREA...AND WITH SOME GOOD SURFACE HEATING...WE SHOULD SEE SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. WITH A LACK OF UPPER LEVEL 
SUPPORT...THE CONVECTION SHOULD DIE NEAR SUNSET. THURSDAY LOOKS 
PRETTY SIMILAR TO TODAY...EXCEPT A LITTLE WARMER. ON THURSDAY NIGHT 
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER ONTARIO PUSHES SOUTHEAST...BRINGING A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT TOWARD OUR AREA. THE MODELS DIFFER 
GREATLY WITH THE TIMING OF THE MAXIMUM LIFT...WITH THE GFS SHOWING 
IT IN OUR AREA AROUND 12Z FRIDAY...AND THE NAM SHOWING IT AROUND 18Z 
FRIDAY. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE SLOWER SOLUTION AS THE GFS MAY BE 
INFLUENCED BY CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE 
RANGE LATE THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY OF TIMING. A 
DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR MASS WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A DRY PERIOD WITH AMPLIFIED EASTERN STATES UPPER TROF/WESTERN STATES 
RIDGE WHICH KEEPS UPPER LEVEL FLOW NORTHERLY AND LOW LEVEL FLOW 
EASTERLY ACROSS THE REGION. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A LITTLE BELOW 
NORMAL EARLY IN THE PERIOD MAINLY NORTHERN SECTIONS BUT SURFACE 
THROUGH UPPER LEVEL RIDGING DEVELOPS MONDAY AND TUESDAY ALLOWING FOR 
A GRADUAL WARMING TREND INTO THE END OF THE WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...
LOTS OF CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON...BUT JUDGING FROM LAST NIGHT
WHEN THIS AREA WAS SOUTHWEST OF US...THIS CONVECTION WILL SLOWLY
DISSIPATE THIS EVENING. LINE OF CONVECTION CROSSING OHIO VALLEY NOW
MAY BE ABLE TO SURVIVE LONG ENOUGH TO MAKE IT INTO NWRN PART OF
AREA...SO I HAVE BUMPED UP POPS THERE. SO HAVE HIGHER POPS
SOUTH...WHERE BETTER EFFECTS OF DEFORMATION ZONE ARE LOCATED...AND
WEST...CONSIDERING AFOREMENTIONED LINE OF CONVECTION.

WILL SLOWLY DRY OUT POPS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...THEN FAIRLY
STRONG FRONT PUNCHES THROUGH CWA SOMETIME AROUND THURSDAY NIGHT.
TODAYS MODELS ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH TAKING FRONT TO NEAR
THE GULF COAST AND LEAVING THE AREA DRY THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF
THE FORECAST PERIOD.

HAVE STUCK CLOSE TO GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS JUST A LITTLE COOLER THAN 
GUIDANCE ON INITIAL POST-FRONTAL COOL DOWN.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
954 AM EDT TUE JUL 17 2007

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A DIFFUSE STATIONARY FRONT
ACROSS KENTUCKY WITH THETA-E RIDGE EXTENDING INTO THE NORTHERN THIRD
OF THE FORECAST AREA. A GOOD DEAL OF MID-LEVEL MOISTURE IS MOVING SLOWLY
NORTHEAST ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WITH PWS INCREASING TO 1.7 TO 2 INCHES
OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY.

AREA SOUNDINGS SHOW AIRMASS WILL BE MODERATELY UNSTABLE THIS 
AFTERNOON WITH CAPES OF 2000-2500 J/KG. WBZ WILL BE QUITE A BIT 
HIGHER THAN YESTERDAYS...SO THREAT OF HAIL WILL BE REDUCED. 
HOWEVER...GIVEN MODERATE CAPES AND ABUNDANT MOISTURE...MAIN CONCERN FROM
AFTERNOON STORMS WILL BE DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS DUE TO PRECIPITATION
LOADING. SINCE STORM MOTIONS WILL BE SLOW (NEAR 5 MPH)...LOCALIZED FLASH
FLOODING IS POSSIBLE.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST REFLECTS CURRENT THINKING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREA REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE SOUTHERN 
MS VALLEY REGION...WITH A LONGWAVE TROUGH IS POSITIONED OVER NEW 
ENGLAND AND THE GREAT LAKES. THIS IS RESULTING IN A DEFORMATION ZONE 
OVER TN/KY AND THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WHICH HAS ACTED AS A FOCUS 
FOR AFTERNOON CONVECTION THE PAST FEW DAYS. MODELS ARE INDICATING A 
GOOD FEED OF GULF MOISTURE SPREADING INTO THE AREA TODAY...AND THIS 
MOISTURE COMBINED WITH THE LIFT FROM DEFORMATION SHOULD MAKE SHOWERS 
AND TSTMS LIKELY ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
INSTABILITY LOOKS LIMITED BY WEAK LAPSE RATES.. WENT A LITTLE ABOVE 
MOS GUIDANCE ON TEMPS TODAY AS THE MOS FORECAST OF OVERCAST CLOUDS 
LOOKS TOO PESSIMISTIC. ON WEDNESDAY THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE 
OVERALL PATTERN...THOUGH THE MIDLEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE WESTERLY AS 
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSES TO THE NORTH...CUTTING OFF THE FEED OF 
MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTH. ON THURSDAY THE ATLANTIC RIDGE BUILDS WEST 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST...WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO LIMIT THE SUPPLY OF 
DEEP MOISTURE. THUS WILL HAVE HIGH CHANCE POPS ON WEDNESDAY AND 
LOW/SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO 00Z RUN OF GFS DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE 
FORECAST WHICH CONTINUES TO FEATURE A COOL FRONT MOVING INTO THE 
REGION ON FRIDAY. SLIGHTLY EDGED POPS HIGHER FOR FRIDAY WITH GRADUAL 
DECREASE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH FRIDAY NIGHT AS FRONT MAKES PROGRESS TO 
JUST SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE BORDER BY 12Z SATURDAY. OF 
COURSE FRONT MAY NOT MAKE IT QUITE AS FAR SOUTH AS GFS DEPICTION AND 
STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN PORTION OF CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE AS WELL AS SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA ON SATURDAY FOR THIS 
POSSIBILITY. KEPT REMAINDER OF FORECAST DRY WITH HEALTHY UPPER TROF 
IN PLACE THROUGH THIS PERIOD. ALTHOUGH PROBABILITY MAY GRADUALLY 
INCREASE DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE NEW WORK WEEK AS GFS INDICATES 
FORMATION OF INVERTED SURFACE TROF ACROSS THE MID SOUTH WITH 
ASSOCIATED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN. STUCK FAIRLY CLOSE TO GFS MEX 
MOS TEMPS THROUGHOUT.

CONVECTION FIRING NEAR WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY THIS AFTERNOON IN

1000 AM EDT MON JUL 16 2007

.DISCUSSION...FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE NORTH EXTENDS TO NEAR THE 
KENTUCKY/TENNESSEE BORDER BUT IS VERY WEAK.  DEW POINTS DO NOT 
REALLY DROP OFF UNTIL THE OHIO RIVER.  SOME SHOWER ACTIVITY BREAKING 
OUT NEAR THIS BOUNDARY IN WEST VIRGINIA AND EXPECT THIS TO SPREAD 
WITH THE AFTERNOON HEATING TO INCLUDE SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF OUR WARNING AREA.

MORE MOISTURE CONVERGENCE ACROSS NORTHERN ALABAMA/GEORGIA WITH COME 
ASSOCIATED SHOWER ACTIVITY THERE WILL ALSO HELP TRIGGER CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF OUR FORECAST AREA.

ALL THIS SAID TO SAY THAT MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL SEE SOME 
SCATTERED AFTERNOON CONVECTION WITH SOME ISOLATED PULSE SEVERE 
ACTIVITY.  THE GREATEST THREAT AS USUAL FOR SUMMERTIME CONVECTION IS 
FOR DOWNBURST WINDS.

CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK SO NO CHANGES COMING.


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...RADAR 
INDICATING AN AREA OF SHOWERS AHEAD OF A WEAK FRONT IN KY HAS 
DISSIPATED.  FRONT SHOULD CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES INTO OUR 
AREA...ALONG WITH THE MOISTURE.  BUT STILL SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY 
TODAY...WILL CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SOME DIURNAL ACTIVITY TODAY.  
DEEPER MOISTURE ADVECTS IN ON TUESDAY ALONG WITH A SHORTWAVE PASSING 
THROUGH...WILL GO WITH HIGHER POPS FOR TUESDAY WITH BETTER MOISTURE 
AVAILABLE.  ANOTHER SHORTWAVE PASSES THROUGH THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY 
WITH SOME LINGERING MOISTURE AVAILABLE WITH MORE SCATTERED ACTIVITY 
POSSIBLE.  KEPT 40 POPS FOR WEDNESDAY.  STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...GFS STILL INDICATING A 
SERIES ON SHORTWAVES ROTATING OVER THE RIDGE.  WILL GO WITH LOW 
CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY.  A FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE

.SHORT TERM  (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH 
SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING ALONG THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN WILL DEVELOP 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS WEEK...WITH DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW ALONG 
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC 
KEEPING DEEP MOISTURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST. WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS DEVELOPING EACH DAY...SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD DEVELOP 
MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS...ESPECIALLY NEAR THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY THROUGH 
TUESDAY...SINCE UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS ARE PROGGED TO BE WEAK AND A 
WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL MAINLY TREND TOWARD 
PERSISTENCE...SINCE THE AIR MASS SHOULD REMAIN UNCHANGED THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT WITH ONLY CONVECTION POSSIBLY KEEPING MAXES FROM BEING 
REACHED. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES WILL 
MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...PROVIDING A CHANCE OF 
CONVECTION THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD.  BEST CHANCE OF ACTIVITY WILL 
BE DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS.  ADDITIONALLY...MODELS NOW INDICATE A

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH A MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME LIGHT 
CONVECTION ACROSS CENTRAL AL AND CENTRAL GA NEAR AN OLD FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY...AND ALSO OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY NEAR THE COLD FRONT. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS AND A MODIFIED BNA 12Z SOUNDING INDICATE THAT A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WITH A HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER CONTENT 
WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. AS A RESULT... 
THINK THAT A FEW ISOLATED TSTORMS COULD BECOME SEVERE WITH STRONG 
GUSTY WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. A LACK OF TRIGGERING 
MECHANISMS SHOULD KEEP THE COVERAGE OF CONVECTION FROM BECOMING TOO 
EXTENSIVE...SO THINK CURRENT FORECAST POPS ARE STILL APPROPRIATE.

CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK OVERALL...BUT WILL UPDATE 
THIS MORNING TO REMOVE MENTION OF MORNING PRECIP...AND TO TWEAK 
TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER EASTER NOAM 
TRAILS OFF OVER SOUTHEAST US, BUT STILL PROVIDES ENOUGH INSTABILITY 
TO ALLOW FOR A CHANCE OF PRECIP TODAY. BERMUDA-LIKE SURFACE HIGH TO 
EAST ALSO ALLOWS SOME DEEPER MOISTURE TO INVADE OUR EXTREME SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS ALONG THE GEORGIA AND ALABAMA BORDERS. HAVE INCREASED POPS 
DOWN THERE TO 40-50 RANGE, AND ALONG THE NORTHERN PLATEAU TO 
30S-ISH, WHILE KEEPING OTHER POPS LARGELY UNCHANGED. LOWERED MAX 
TEMPS A FEW DEGREES EVERYWHERE DUE TO CLOUDS EXPECTED TODAY. DO NOT 
EXPECT WIDESPREAD RAINS, BUT DO EXPECT BRIEF HEAVY DOWNPOURS UNDER 
THUNDERSTORMS. FFG VALUES STILL SO HIGH THAT FLOODING IS NOT LIKELY 
AT THIS POINT. WILL, AS EVER, KEEP AN EYE OUT, THOUGH.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS INDICATING MOISTURE 
INCREASING FROM THE SOUTH ON MONDAY AS A SHORTWAVE APPROACHES TO 
REGION...WILL GO WITH 40 TO 50 POPS WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN THE 
SOUTH.  DEEP MOISTURE LINGERING INTO MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION...WILL GO WITH 40 TO 50 
POPS AGAIN ON TUESDAY...WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN THE MOUNTAINS.  GFS 
STILL INDICATING A SERIES ON SHORTWAVES ROTATING OVER THE RIDGE THE 
REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED.  WILL GO WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE

SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING ALONG IT OVER CENTRAL AL AND 
CENTRAL GA. DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW ALONG THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF A 
STRENGTHENING BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WILL HELP TO 
INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS. AS A RESULT...INSTABILITY WILL SLOWLY INCREASE EACH DAY WITH 
SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION POSSIBLE ON SUNDAY...AND AN EVEN BETTER 
CHANCE ON MONDAY AS DEEP MOISTURE BECOMES ENTRENCHED OVER THE ENTIRE 
REGION. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY ON MONDAY...SINCE 
UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS ARE PROGGED TO BE WEAK...AND A WEAK COLD FRONT 
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY SHOULD REMAIN NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH THE 
FORECAST PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE 
A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES WILL TRACK THROUGH THE REGION THROUGHOUT THE 
EXTENDED TIME FRAME. DETAILS...ESPECIALLY TIMING AND TRACK...OF EACH 
WAVE REMAIN IN QUESTION...BUT IN GENERAL SHOULD SEE UNSETTLED 
WEATHER THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. BEST...STRONGEST OF THE WAVES 
IS EXPECTED IN THE AREA EARLY IN THE PERIOD...AROUND THE TUESDAY

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE DEEP 
SOUTH...WITH A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION NEAR THE FRONT OVER 
CENTRAL AL AND CENTRAL GA...SLOWLY DRIFTING NORTHEAST. MODELS 
INDICATE A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS 
CONVECTION...AND ALSO INDICATE THAT THIS SHORT WAVE COULD POSSIBLY 
TRIGGER A FEW ISOLATED TSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN 
AND SOUTHWEST NC. MOISTURE REMAINS LIMITED WITH A WEAK MID-LEVEL CAP 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...SO THINK THAT ANY CONVECTION SHOULD 
BE ISOLATED IN NATURE. 

CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK OVERALL...BUT WILL UPDATE 
THIS MORNING TO MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION ACROSS THE SMOKIES. 
THERE MAY NOT BE ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR CONVECTION IN THE MOUNTAINS... 
BUT THE MODELS HAVE BEEN HINTING AT SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER 
THE SMOKIES FOR A FEW DAYS NOW...SO WOULD LIKE TO HAVE A MENTION OF 
20 POPS THERE.

TODAY. MODELS SHOW THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE AND LIFT REMAINING JUST 
SOUTH OF THE TN BORDER...BUT A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE SOUTHERN 
VALLEY AND SW NC CANNOT BE RULED OUT...SO WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE 
POP THERE. IF HIGH CLOUDS CAN BREAK ENOUGH...THERE COULD BE ENOUGH 
DESTABILIZATION FOR TSTMS IN THE SOUTH...WHILE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF 
THE AREA WILL BE CAPPED BY A MIDLEVEL INVERSION. EXPECT THAT THE 
HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE AREA THIS MORNING WILL GIVE WAY BY THE 
AFTERNOON...ALLOWING TEMPS TO RISE INTO THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN THE 
VALLEY. THE TROUGH WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA BY MIDNIGHT SO WILL END 
ALL POPS BEFORE THAT TIME. THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE ENOUGH 
MOISTURE OR LIFT TO SUSTAIN SHOWERS OVERNIGHT.

PRESSURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA IN BETWEEN THESE FRONTS. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL SOME SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ASSOCIATED

CONVECTIVE SYSTEM BRINGING PRECIP TO WESTERN TN AND AREAS
SOUTH...AND IS WEAKENING AS IT MOVES EAST. WITH MUCH DRIER AIR IN
PLACE OVER OUR AREA...THINK WEAKENING TREND WILL CONTINUE AND DO
NOT EXPECT ANY THUNDER TO MAKE IT THIS FAR EAST TONIGHT.
HOWEVER...A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OR SPRINKLES MAY MAKE IT INTO
SOUTHERN ZONES LATER TONIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW...SO WILL ADD
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO THESE AREAS. WILL BEEF UP CLOUDS A BIT AS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG COLD FRONT ALONG THE GULF 
COAST...WITH A COOL AND VERY DRY AIR MASS (FOR JULY) OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS DRY AIR MASS WILL INHIBIT ANY CONVECTION 
TONIGHT...AND SHOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT 
TOMORROW AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. 
MODELS INDICATE SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY DEVELOPING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON...BUT LIMITED MOISTURE SHOULD 
KEEP ANY CONVECTION SCATTERED AT BEST. SOUNDINGS REVEAL A DEEP 
INVERTED-V SHAPED PROFILE IN THE LOWER-LEVELS...WHICH COULD HELP TO 
PRODUCE SOME STRONG GUSTY WINDS WITH ANY CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS. A 
TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN WILL THEN SETTLE OVER THE REGION FOR THE 
WEEKEND...WITH A BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND ISOLATED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...ESPECIALLY 
NEAR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...GOING INTO A FAIRLY UNSETTLED 
WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE EXTENDED. AN UPPER TROUGH WILL BE OVER THE 
EASTERN U.S. WITH A SERIES OF SHORT WAVES AND A FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
MOVING THROUGH DURING THE PERIOD. MODEL AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY 
POOR AND CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON DETAILS BUT WILL GENERALLY CONTINUE 
WITH 20 TO 30 POPS THROUGH MUCH OF THE PERIOD AND STAYED NEAR

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD AS SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. REGION REMAINS 
IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AS AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH REMAINS ANCHORED 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CONUS. MAIN CHALLENGE FOR THE SHORT 
TERM IS DECIDING ON POTENTIAL ONSET OF PRECIP BY LATE IN THE SECOND 
PERIOD AS QUITE EXTENSIVE DIFFERENCES EXIST BETWEEN GFS AND 
WRF...WITH GFS BRINING LIGHT PRECIP INTO OUR WESTERN TIER BY 12Z 
FRIDAY. WRF KEEPS AREA DRY PAST 12Z. INCLINATION IS TO FAVOR WRF AND 
KEEP THURSDAY NIGHT PERIOD DRY AS SREF TENDS TO SUPPORT THE WRF 
TIMING. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE CLOSELY.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...CONFIDENCE BECOMES 
GENERALLY LOW BEYOND SATURDAY...GIVEN DIFFERING MODEL SOLUTIONS.  
GFS MAY SUFFER FROM FEEDBACK AS IT OFFERS MUCH DIFFERENT TIMING 
OF ANY CONVECTIVE PRECIP...KEEPING DEEPER RH TO OUR SOUTH AND 
OFFERING A DRY DAY FOR SATURDAY. UPPER FLOW BECOMES WEAK SW WITH 
SOME TROUGHINESS FROM SRN PLAINS INTO LOWER MISS VALLEY BY SUNDAY 
AND MONDAY...AGAIN MAKING FOR A DIFFICULT FORECAST IN TIMING 
POSSIBLE WEAK IMPULSES ALONG WITH TYPICAL DIURNAL CONVECTION.

FOR FRIDAY THERE IS SOME AGREEMENT...WITH SOME WEAK UPPER LEVEL 
SUPPORT AND POSSIBLE SURFACE TROUGH...JUSTIFYING PREVIOUS 40 PERCENT 
POPS. A BLEND OF MODEL SOLUTIONS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...AS WELL 
AS MESHING IN WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES GRIDS...SO MADE SOME SLIGHT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT EXTENDING FROM NEAR PITTSBURG SOUTHWEST TO NEAR 
MEMPHIS...WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING AHEAD OF IT OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A BROAD UPPER 
TROUGH OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY WILL PUSH THIS FRONT THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA BY THIS EVENING. DRIER AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR WILL 
THEN SLOWLY FILTER INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY. THINK THAT THIS DRIER AIR WILL KEEP FOG FROM BECOMING TOO 
DENSE OR WIDESPREAD OVERNIGHT. THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION ONLY 
PATCHY FOG IN THE ZONES. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE VALUES ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS SHOW ANOTHER 
SHORT-WAVE ROTATING DOWN TO THE BASE OF THE UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST UNITED STATES FOR FRIDAY. ASSOCIATED 
SURFACE BOUNDARY WILL SWEEP SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON PRODUCING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
LATEST GFS SOLUTION DIVERGES FROM OLD GFS ENSEMBLE AND ECMWF IN 
REGARD TO CONVECTION RETURNING FOR THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
THE NEW GFS IS MUCH MORE BULLISH.

WILL MAINTAIN FORECAST OF STALLING FRONT ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES
UNTIL NORTHEAST UPPER TROUGH LIFTS OUT BY EARLY NEXT WEEK, WHICH WILL
ALLOW RETURN OF MOISTURE BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR LATE
SUNDAY INTO NEXT WEEK. MAIN LIFTING WILL BE FROM LOCAL TERRAIN

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STILL ON TRACK FOR SIGNIFICANT 
WIDESPREAD RAIN EVENT FOR TODAY AS SHORT WAVE TROUGH AND SURFACE 
COLD FRONT APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FROM THE WEST. 
MOISTURE PROFILE STILL QUITE IMPRESSIVE (PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 
EXCEEDING TWO INCHES PER WRF) SO ANTICIPATE GENERAL RAINFALL TO 
POTENTIALLY APPROACH ONE INCH...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS. THIS 
SYSTEM WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD TO EAST OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS 
BY TONIGHT TAKING MOST OF THE PRECIP WITH IT. HAVE GENERALLY GONE 
DRY AFTER 00Z THURSDAY WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE FAR EASTERN 
MOUNTAIN ZONES. FOR TEMPS...HAD NO REASON TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE 
FROM GFS GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES 
MADE FOR THESE PERIODS TO FORECAST GRIDS...AS PATTERN STILL LOOKS TO 
HAVE UPPER RIDGE IN THE WEST AND LONG WAVE TROUGH IN THE EAST. A 
DECENT FRONTAL PASSAGE FOR WEDS NIGHT WILL BRING DRY AND WARM WEATHER
FOR THURSDAY. SHORTWAVE EARLY FRIDAY LOOKS TO BRING BETTER COVERAGE 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THAN PREVIOUS GRIDS...SO FOR NOW 
INCREASED POPS TO JUST BELOW 50 PERCENT FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 

CONVECTION LOOKS TO BE MORE ISOLATED AND DIURNAL IN NATURE FROM 
SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...BUT NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO REMOVE LOW 
POPS WHERE THEY EXISTED IN GRIDS FOR NOW. WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL 
FLOW RETURNS BY TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY (NEW DAY 7)...SO SHOULD SEE

LOWER POPS FOR THE REST OF THE EVENING...WITH POPS RISING AGAIN
LATE TONIGHT. WILL ALSO REDUCE THE MENTION OF THUNDER TO ISOLATED AS

CATEGORICAL POPS FOR WEDNESDAY.  SHOULD ALSO SEE A BETTER CHANCE FOR 
STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS.  STAYED NEAR MOS GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...A DEEP UPPER TROUGH 
WILL BE FIRMLY ENTRENCHED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HUDSON BAY WITH 
UNSEASONABLY COOL AIR OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND SPREADING INTO THE 
NORTHEAST UNITED STATES BY WEDNESDAY EVENING. A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT 
COLD FRONT WILL BE JUST SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST BY WEDNESDAY 
EVENING WITH CONVECTION COMING TO AN END BEFORE MIDNIGHT. COLD FRONT 
WILL SETTLE SOUTH TO NEAR THE GULF COAST BEFORE BECOMING STATIONARY 
WITH DRIER AIR AND PLEASANT TEMPERATURES FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE 
WEEK AS SURFACE RIDGE AND NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT DOMINATES.

MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SHOW ANOTHER WAVE ROTATING AROUND DEEP UPPER 
TROUGH ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY FOR FRIDAY.  
ASSOCIATED BOUNDARY WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FOR FRIDAY. 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED...BUT ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO 
PRODUCE A CHANCE OF MAINLY AFTERNOON-EARLY EVENING CONVECTION.

MODELS SHOW DEEP UPPER TROUGH LIFTING NORTHEAST. HOWEVER...OPERATIONAL
GFS SHOWS A WEAK SHEAR AXIS OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY 
SUNDAY. CONFIDENCE OF THIS FEATURE IS LOW. WILL SHOW SOME RETURN

.DISCUSSION...WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...CONVECTION WILL 
CONTINUE TO DECREASE ACROSS THE MRX CWA THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
EVENING.  HOWEVER...AS THE WEAK SHORT RESPONSIBLE FOR THE CONVECTION 
SLOWLY EXITS THE AREA...ANOTHER WILL MOVE IN.  AS A RESULT...WE MAY 
CONTINUE TO SEE A FEW SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OVERNIGHT.  
THEREFORE...WILL CONTINUE WITH 20 TO 30 POPS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT  
FOR MOST AREAS.  ALL LOOKS GOOD IN THE CURRENT FORECAST...WILL

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...RADAR INDICATING ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS FIRING UP AHEAD OF A SHORTWAVE...MAINLY 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE CWA.  WILL KEEP 30 POPS FOR OUR 
SOUTHERN ZONES AND THE MOUNTAINS AND 20 ELSEWHERE.  ACTIVITY SHOULD 
DIMINSH AFTER SUNSET WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.  MODELS 
INDICATE A DEEPER SHORTWAVE MOVING IN LATE TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  
WILL ADD 20-30 POPS FOR LATE TONIGHT WITH THE BEST CHANCES HOLDING 
OFF UNTIL TUESDAY.  STAYED NEAR MOS GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH 
ACROSS EASTERN CANADA (SOUTHERN HUDSON BAY) WILL BE THE MAIN FEATURE 
OF INTEREST FOR THE FORECAST AREA FOR MOST OF THE EXTENDED. 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT PRODUCING THE BEST CHANCES OF WIDESPREAD 
CONVECTION. ENSEMBLES SHOW GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS FEATURES SO 
CONFIDENCE IS HIGHER THAN NORMAL WITH FROPA. WILL UP POPS TO LIKELY 
MOST LOCATIONS FOR WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

FOR THURSDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND...FRONT STALLS ACROSS THE GULF 
COAST STATES WITH A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES RIDING ALONG THE BOUNDARY 
KEEPING CONVECTION ACTIVE...GENERALLY SOUTH OF CHA. WILL CALL FOR 
BEST CHANCES OF CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEAST SECTIONS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH GENERALLY DRY CONDITIONS FOR NORTH AND 
NORTHWEST SECTIONS.

DUE TO PATTERN CHANGE TO NORTHWEST FLOW AND AGREEMENT AMONG ENSEMBLES...
HAVE GENERALLY ACCEPTED GFX GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...RADAR INDICATING A FEW SHOWERS TRACKING ACROSS 
NORTHERN AL/GA WHICH ARE DISSIPATING AS THE MOVE NORTH INTO OUR 
CWA.  MOST OF ACTIVITY SHOULD STAY SOUTH TODAY WHICH IS HANDLED WELL 
BY THE CURRENT FORECAST...NO NEED TO CHANGE POPS FOR TODAY.   
TEMPERATURES ALSO APPEAR ON  TRACK.  WILL UPDATE ZONES TO REMOVE 
MORNING WORDING...REST OF FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...WEAK MID TO UPPER LEVEL 
CIRCULATION OVER OK THIS MORNING STARTING TO SPREAD A LITTLE 
MOISTURE EASTWARD INTO THE LOWER MISS VALLEY REGION...WHILE SKIES 
HOLDING GENERALLY MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY ACROSS OUR REGION.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATED DEW POINT TEMPS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 
70S ACROSS EXTREME SRN PARTS OF EAST TN INTO SW NC...WHILE STILL 
FINDING MUCH LOWER DEW POINT TEMPS JUST IN THE 50S TO LOWER 60S 
ACROSS SWRN VA. 

THINKING THAT ONCE AGAIN THE NAM-WRF IS OVERDOING CONVECTIVE 
PRECIPITATION IN ADVANCE OF THE WEAK UPPER LOW/TROUGH TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AS IT PERFORMED POORLY WITH THE GULF COAST SYSTEM OVER THE 
WEEKEND. THUS...WILL KEEP POPS RATHER LOW FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT
AND MOSTLY CONFINED TO SRN THIRD AND THE FOOTHILLS AND MOUNTAINS OF 
EAST TN. PREVIOUS POP GRIDS GENERALLY ACCEPTED WITH SLIGHT 
ADJUSTMENTS...TRENDED PRETTY MUCH IN LINE WITH GFS SOLUTION.

FOR TUESDAY...09/00Z GFS/NAM-WRF AND LATEST ECMWF SHOW SOME ENERGY 
OR WEAK IMPULSE TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE TUESDAY MORNING
...AND MOVING EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA IN THE AFTERNOON. 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS WELL TO OUR NORTH...BUT DAYTIME HEATING AND 
UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT MAY WARRANT LIKELY POPS FOR TUESDAY. FOR NOW
I INCREASED POPS TO NEAR 50 PERCENT ACROSS THE BOARD AND ADDED 
SCATTERED AREAL QUALIFIER. 

MOISTURE SLOWLY INCREASING PER MODEL TIME HEIGHTS...BUT THINK MAX 
TEMPS SHOULD REACH NEAR THE GFS MOS VALUES TODAY. MOS BLEND OR CLOSE 
TO GFS MINS TONIGHT...THEN A BIT COOLER ON TUESDAY IF SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPS...SO STUCK CLOSE TO GFS MAXES FOR TUESDAY.

WILL LINGER ACROSS GA TONIGHT. THE TROUGH WILL WEAKEN AND DRIFT NE.
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD W FM THE ATLC INTO THE N GLFMEX THROUGH THE 
PERIOD. THIS RESULTS IN AN INCREASINGLY SW FLOW OVER THE MRX CWA. 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL MOVE IN THIS FLOW. A GOOD CHANCE OF PCPN 
MATERIALIZES TUE AND TUE NGT AS A STRENGTHENING WAVE MOVES UP IN

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SATELLITE PICS HOW GENERALLY 
DRIER AIR WORKING INTO THE FORECAST AREA...WITH LOW PRESSURE WELL TO 
OUR SOUTH THIS MORNING AND MOVING ALMOST DUE EAST. THIS WAS CLEARLY 
BETTER DEPICTED BY THE 07/00Z GFS MODEL...ALTHOUGH SPOTTY CONVECTION 
DID AFFECT SE TN AND SW NC YESTERDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

MODELS IN BETTER AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH MAINLY LOW 
CHANCES OF DIURNAL CONVECTION ACROSS SOUTHERN THIRD OF FORECAST AREA 
AND ALSO IN THE SMOKY MTNS. DID LOWER POPS FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL 
HOURS GIVEN LATEST RADARS...AND ALSO DECREASED POPS SOME OVER 
CENTRAL PARTS OF THE AREA LATER THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON.

SOME DRYING ACROSS SE TN SHOULD EQUATE TO UPPER 80S OR NEAR 90 
DEGREES FOR CHA MAX (AFTER COOL 82 DEGS YESTERDAY). GENERALLY LEANED 
TOWARD A MOS BLEND FOR HIGHS TODAY AND LOWS TONIGHT.

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...RIDGING BUILDS IN MORE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MONDAY BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STILL 
ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS AND MOUNTAINS. WILL DROP POPS FOR THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY BUT KEEP POPS SOUTHERN VALLEY AND 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS. A WEAK UPPER LOW OVER AR/MO MAY HELP BRING 
MOISTURE NORTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY AND STRONGER SOUTHERLY 
FLOW FROM THE GULF AS UPPER HIGH BUILDS OVER FLORIDA AND THE EASTERN 
GULF WILL HELP. LOW CHANCE POPS ALL AREAS TUESDAY AND CONTINUE THE 
POPS WEDNESDAY AS UPPER TROUGHING IS OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND A 
COLD FRONT BEGINS TO DROP SOUTH FROM THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS FRONT 
MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY AND THEN BECOMES NEARLY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY COULD BE 
DRAWN ACROSS NRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...GIVEN THE DEW POINT 
TEMPS IN THE 50S OVER SWRN VA AND MID TO UPR 60S ACROSS SRN THIRD OF 
THE AREA THIS MORNING. OTHER FEATURE OF PERHAPS MORE CONCERN (AND 
CERTAINLY MORE DEVIATION ON MODELS HANDLING OF)...IS THE AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE OVER SRN AR AND NRN LA. THINK THAT THE FRONT IS TOO 
WEAK OF A FEATURE...AND THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TOO FAR AWAY TODAY
...SO LOOK FOR MAINLY SOME POSSIBLE DIURNAL CONVECTION OVER MAINLY 
SRN MOST AREAS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS 
LOOKED LIKE A GOOD COMPROMISE AND ALSO MESHED WELL WITH NEIGHBORING 
OFFICES GRIDS.

MODELS DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM SUNDAY ON WITH THE LOW PRESSURE 
AREA TO OUR SW...WITH A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE WET NAM-WRF AND MUCH 
DRIER GFS SOLUTION...GENERALLY TOWARD THE ECMWF SOLUTION. 

OTHERWISE...STILL NOTING A SIGNIFICANT COOL BIAS ON GFS MOS MAX 
TEMPS (GENERALLY AT LEAST 1 TO 3 DEGREES TOO COOL) ESPECIALLY FOR 
CHA AND TYS. THUS...KEPT HIGHS TODAY A LITTLE ABOVE THE GFS MAXES.
MINS TONIGHT NEAR A BLEND SEEMED BEST CHOICE...ALTHO CLEARER SKIES 
AND DRIER AIR OVER EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA FAVORS CLOSER TO COOLER 
GFS MINS THERE.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WILL APPLY PERSISTENCE
FORECAST FOR SUNDAY AS MODELS DIVERGE WITH TRACK OF WEAK UPPER LOW
NOW OVER LOWER MS VALLEY. NAM/WRF BRINGS THIS SYSTEM QUICKLY
NORTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY BY SUNDAY AND THEN ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TO THE MID ATLANTIC SUNDAY NIGHT AND
MONDAY. THE GFS HAS THE UPPER LOW OR WEAKNESS MOVE JUST TO THE
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY AND INTO THE CAROLINAS SUNDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
PATTERN EXPECTED IN THE SHORT TERM.  HOWEVER...LESS CLOUD COVER 
TODAY WILL ALLOW FOR A BIT WARMER AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES AND 
SLIGHTLY GREATER INSTABILITY.  AS A RESULT...WILL CONTINUE TO SEE A 
POSSIBLY OF LATE AFTERNOON ISOLATED CONVECTION...CONFINED MAINLY TO 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  

.LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUE)...MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE 
WEAKENING COLD FRONT WILL PUSH SOUTH INTO THE REGION DURING THE LATE 
THU INTO FRIDAY TIME FRAME.  MODEL TREND...ESPECIALLY WITH THE 
GFS...HAS BEEN DRIER WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND GIVEN THE DROUGHT WE ARE 
IN WILL ONLY CARRY CHANCE POPS THU AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
NORTH...SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE ALL ZONES FRIDAY.  
GFS INDICATES DRIER AIR OVER THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK.  WHILE CERTAINLY CAN NOT RULE OUT ISOLATED 
CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN...WILL NOT ARGUE 
WITH CURRENT FORECAST AND WILL KEEP THINGS DRY UNTIL MONDAY...WHEN 
WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH AND MOUNTAINS. WILL CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES TUE AS NEXT WEAK FRONT MAY BE 
APPROACHING.  WILL NOT ARGUE MUCH WITH GFS MOS TEMPS...JUST A FEW 
TWEAKS HERE AND THERE.

.DISCUSSION...ISOLATED SHOWERS FINALLY DEVELOPED JUST AFTER PEAK 
HEATING LATE THIS AFTERNOON...MAINLY OVER THE SMOKIES AND IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA JUST EAST OF OUR COUNTIES. THESE SPOTTY 
SHOWERS LINGER BUT SHOULD DISSIPATE VERY SOON.

SKIES RELATIVELY CLEAR BUT A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT OF RESIDUAL LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE...WHICH SHOULD KEEP SOME SCATTERED LOW CLOUDS AROUND 
OVERNIGHT. 

WILL REMOVE EARLY EVENING POPS SHORTLY...AND FRESHEN GRIDS AND WEB

257 PM EDT TUE JUL 3 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES ACROSS 
THE WESTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY WITH A TROUGH ALONG THE EAST COAST. 
UPPER FLOW AROUND THE LARGE RIDGE IS TAKING A SYSTEM FROM THE UPPER 
MIDWEST INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES. DEEPER MOISTURE LIES ALONG THE 
GULF COAST NEAR AN OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY. ACROSS THE TN VALLEY AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES WITH ABUNDANT MOISTURE 
IN THE LOW LEVELS. THIS HAS KEPT THE FORECAST AREA PARTLY TO MOSTLY 
CLOUDY WITH MILD TEMPERATURES TODAY. DEW POINTS HAVE RISEN FROM THE 
50S IN THE NORTH YESTERDAY TO THE LOWER 60S TODAY. AT MID AFTERNOON 
TEMPERATURES WERE ONLY IN THE UPPER 70S TO THE LOWER 80S. NAM/WRF 
AND THE RUC SHOWING WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING DOWN FROM THE GREAT 
LAKES THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. NO SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED 
YET BUT AIRMASS IS SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AND IF TEMPERATURES WARM A FEW 
MORE DEGREES CONVECTION MAY DEVELOP BEFORE EVENING. WEDNESDAY 
CONDITIONS LOOK TO BE NEARLY THE SAME BUT WITH A LITTLE MORE SUN AND 
SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES SO ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE AGAIN POSSIBLE DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LINGERING MOISTURE 
WILL BRING SCATTERED PRECIPITATION MAINLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS.  THE NEXT SOMEWHAT ORGANIZED 
SYSTEM SWINGS THROUGH THE REGION ON THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WITH 
INCREASING RAIN CHANCES BUT THIS LOOKS FAIRLY WEAK...SIMILAR OR 
EVEN A LITTLE WEAKER THAN LAST WEEKS FRONT.  THE WEEKEND AT THIS 
TIME LOOKS MAINLY DRY WITH MOISTURE AGAIN RETURNING BY MONDAY WITH 
INCREASING POPS.  

FOR GUIDANCE MODELS CLOSE AND APPEAR REASONABLE SO NO MAJOR 
DEVIATION.

.DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY IN 
CONTROL OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH DRIER AND COOLER AIRMASS IN PLACE. 
STILL APPEARS TO BE WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TODAY...THE RUC AND NAM/WRF BRINGING DEW POINTS 
UP TODAY AND SHOWING GOOD INSTABILITY. THINK IT IS INCREASING 
MOISTURE TOO FAST AND WITH LOW LEVEL CLOUD COVER KEEPING 
TEMPERATURES DOWN THIS WILL LIMIT INSTABILITY. WILL KEEP POPS OUT OF 
THE VALLEYS AND LEAVE THEM AS IS NORTH AND MOUNTAINS. UPDATE OF 
HOURLY TEMPERATURE AND DEW POINT GRIDS BUT NO CHANGES TO WORDING IN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING 
THROUGH THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT TODAY...BUT LOOKS LIKE INSTABILITY 
WILL BE LIMITED...SO WILL JUST KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AND SW VA AS IN PREVIOUS FORECAST.  WILL LINGER SLIGHT

DRY TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.

INCREASING THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY.  DRIER AIR FILTERS IN BEHIND

929 PM EDT MON JUL 2 2007

.DISCUSSION...STILL A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS LINGERING ACROSS MAINLY 
THE UPSLOPE AREAS.  FAIRLY STABLE ACROSS THE AREA.  THINK THE 
ACTIVITY WILL DIMINISH BY MIDNIGHT...SO WILL UPDATE ZONES TO REMOVE 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES FOR THE REST OF TONIGHT.  WILL CONTINUE TO 
HANDLE REMAINING SHOWERS WITH NOWCASTS.  REST OF FORECAST LOOKS ON 
TRACK...NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES HAD BROUGHT DRIER AIR TO MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA EXCEPT THE EXTREME SOUTH WHERE DEW POINTS WERE IN THE 
MID 60S TO NEAR 70 THIS AFTERNOON. AN INVERTED TROUGH OVER EAST 
TENNESSEE AND THE SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS HELPED TO ENHANCE CONVERGENCE 
IN THE SOUTHERN MOUNTAINS CAUSING SCATTERED SHOWERS TO DEVELOP IN THE
SOUTHEAST TN AND SW NC MOUNTAINS BY NOON TODAY AND THEN HAVE BEEN 
PERSISTENT IN POLK AND CHEROKEE COUNTIES. EXPECT THESE SHOWERS TO 
CONTINUE INTO EARLY EVENING BEFORE ENDING WITH SOME POSSIBLE 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS. HOWEVER WITH TEMPERATURES ONLY 
IN THE MID 80S AT BEST INSTABILITY IS LIMITED SO THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
BE BRIEF. CROSS SECTION DATA FROM NAM/WRF AND GFS INDICATES PLENTY 
OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TODAY...TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY SO EXPECT 
EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER TODAY TO SLOWLY DECREASE TONIGHT AND REFORM 
TUESDAY. HAVE WORDED SKY CONDITIONS PARTLY CLOUDY TONIGHT. GFS 
INDICATES MOISTURE THINNING TUESDAY SO HAVE MOST AREAS MOSTLY SUNNY. 
WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AROUND...MORE HEATING AND SOME WEAK IMPULSES 
MOVING SOUTHEAST IN NORTHWEST FLOW HAVE KEPT ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS. WITH SOME CLOUDS TONIGHT WILL STAY WARMER FOR LOWS AND GO 
CLOSE TO THE HIGHER MAV NUMBERS FOR MAXIMUMS TUESDAY.

AND A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDS UP ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AS 
WELL. LIGHT SHOWERS WERE OCCURRING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL 
VALLEY THIS MORNING BUT HAD JUST ABOUT DISSIPATED AS THEY MOVED INTO

ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. MUCH LOWER DEW POINTS 
ARE IN PLACE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL ZONES WITH HIGHER DEW 
POINTS STILL ACROSS THE SOUTHERN THIRD. THE BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIP

REMAINS DRY. DID NOT CHANGE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST

SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WHERE MOISTURE AND SOME INSTABILITY LINGER. 
BY WEDNESDAY ATMOSPHERIC INSTABILITY STRENGTHENS TO A DEGREE AND 
RETURN FLOW SLOWLY MOISTENS THE LOW LEVELS SO STAYED WITH A SLIGHT 
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. STILL THE BEST CHANCE IN THE 
SEVEN DAY PERIOD WILL BE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL

INTO AND THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. MAINTAINED LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
THE EVENT AND KEPT POPS OUT FOR SATURDAY BEHIND THE FRONT. STAYED

ZONES TO LOWER CHANCES FOR RAIN FOR TONIGHT...WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR OUR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN ZONES AND DRY IN THE

NEAR THE SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT IN CENTRAL KY. CONVECTION HAS ALSO 
DEVELOPED IN THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AREA. THE BEST INSTABILITY IS IN 
THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THAT RECEIVED MORE SUN THIS 
MORNING. WILL HAVE TO WATCH THIS AREA FOR STRONG TO SEVERE 
STORMS...WITH DOWNBURST WINDS BEING THE MAIN THREAT. EXPECT THAT THE 
PRECIP CHANCES WILL TAPER OFF IN THE NORTH THROUGH THE EVENING AS 
THE FRONT MAKES SLOW SOUTHWARD PROGRESS. WILL HAVE A MENTION OF 
SCATTERED STORMS IN THE EVENING...AND ISOLATED AFTER MIDNIGHT. ON 
SUNDAY THE FRONT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE ACROSS THE AREA...AND LOWER 
DEWPOINTS WILL MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS. PLENTY OF 
MOISTURE AND THE NEARBY FRONT WILL GIVE ANOTHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
SHOWERS HAVE FORMED NEAR THE SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT IN CENTRAL KY. 
CONVECTION HAS ALSO DEVELOPED IN THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AREA. THE BEST 
INSTABILITY IS IN THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THAT RECEIVED 
MORE SUN THIS MORNING. WILL HAVE TO WATCH THIS AREA FOR STRONG TO 
SEVERE STORMS...WITH DOWNBURST WINDS BEING THE MAIN THREAT. EXPECT 
THAT THE PRECIP CHANCES WILL TAPER OFF IN THE NORTH THROUGH THE 
EVENING AS THE FRONT MAKES SLOW SOUTHWARD PROGRESS. WILL HAVE A 
MENTION OF SCATTERED STORMS IN THE EVENING...AND ISOLATED AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. ON SUNDAY THE FRONT SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE ACROSS THE 
AREA...AND LOWER DEWPOINTS WILL MAKE THEIR WAY INTO THE NORTHERN 
SECTIONS. PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND THE NEARBY FRONT WILL GIVE ANOTHER 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS...MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON. 

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
COLD FRONT EXPECTED TO MOVE JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA
SUNDAY NIGHT WITH HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES BRINGING
COOLER DRIER AIRMASS ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY.
MONDAY MODELS STILL HINTING AT LINGERING MOISTURE ACROSS TN AND NC
MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU. COLD FRONT TO THE SOUTH ALSO WEAK
AND LIKELY WASHING OUT. WITH THE HEATING OF THE DAY ISOLATED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE THESE AREAS. TUESDAY LOOKS TO BE
DRY WITH MORE STABLE AIR IN THE VALLEYS AND ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR
ISOLATED LATE AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TN AND NC
MOUNTAINS. WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY A COLD FRONT WILL DROP SLOWLY
SOUTH FROM THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. CONVECTION
SHOULD BECOME SCATTERED IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENINGS THURSDAY AND
FRIDAY. LEFT SATURDAY DRY AS FRONT IS SOUTH OF FORECAST AREA.
NIGHTTIME TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHTS
ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST HALF OF FORECAST AREA AS DEW POINTS DROP TO
THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S. DEW POINTS AND AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES RISE
BY MIDWEEK AHEAD OF NEXT FRONT.

1029 AM EDT SAT JUN 30 2007

.DISCUSSION...
A 13Z SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE FRONT HAS MOVED SLOWLY SOUTH...AND
IS LOCATED THROUGH CENTRAL KY AND SOUTHERN WV. MIDLEVEL CLOUDS ARE
PRODUCING SOME LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PORTIONS
OF THE AREA THIS MORNING. THIS CLOUD COVER WILL PREVENT AS MUCH
DESTABILIZATION...AT LEAST CENTRAL AND NORTH...AS WE HAVE SEEN THE
PAST FEW DAYS. IT WILL ALSO HOLD MAX TEMPS BACK...ESPECIALLY
NORTH...SO WILL LOWER FORECAST MAX TEMPS TODAY WITH THE UPDATE. IN
THE SOUTH...THERE IS MUCH LESS CLOUDINESS...AND THIS AREA IS MORE
LIKELY TO SEE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP IN THE AFTERNOON.
WILL MAKE SOME SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO POPS...RAISING THEM IN THE
SOUTH BUT STILL IN THE CHANCE RANGE. WITH SURFACE HEATING IN THE
SOUTH...CAPES WILL APPROACH 2000 J/KG...SO SOME ISOLATED SEVERE
STORMS WILL AGAIN BE POSSIBLE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY NEAR OUR 
NORTHERN ZONES AT THE MOMENT.  FRONT EXPECTED TO DRIFT SLOWLY 
SOUTH...AND WILL BE A FACTOR FOR OUR AREA IN THE SHORT TERM.  WITH 
DECENT INSTABILITY AGAIN TODAY...AND WEAK FRONT OVER THE AREA...WILL 
GO WITH CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  WILL TAPER OFF 
AND END POPS IN THE NORTH THIS EVENING...BUT WILL GO WITH LOW CHANCE 
EARLY THEN SLIGHT CHANCE LATE SOUTH CLOSER TO THE EXPECTED FRONTAL 
POSITION. WILL TWEAK MAV TEMPS UP A BIT SOME LOCATIONS TODAY...BUT 
NO MAJOR ARGUMENTS WITH MAV TEMPS FOR TONIGHT.   

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY STILL CLOSE 
ENOUGH TO THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE BORDER TO KEEP SLIGHT THROUGH LOW 
CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ON SUNDAY. CONTINUED 
WITH A DRY FORECAST MONDAY AND TUESDAY AS SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS SOUTH 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION PRESSING AIRMASS 
BOUNDARY WELL INTO THE DEEP SOUTH. MAINTAINED IDEA OF SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY AS MOISTENING OF THE LOCAL AIRMASS 
OCCURS AS WINDS BECOME SOUTHERLY ON THE BACK SIDE OF RETREATING 
SURFACE RIDGE. DID NOT CHANGE PREVIOUS FORECAST FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY WHICH FEATURE SLIGHT INCREASE IN PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION 
AS ATMOSPHERE BECOMES A LITTLE MORE UNSTABLE AS MOISTURE INCREASES 
AHEAD OF YET ANOTHER FRONTAL BOUNDARY DUE IN THE FORECAST AREA ON 
FRIDAY. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE TO MEX MOS TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE WITH 
SOME TWEAKING ESPECIALLY LATE IN THE LONG TERM FORECAST.

12Z SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THE SURFACE FRONT LOCATED ACROSS THE
OHIO VALLEY...WITH A TROUGH JUST EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS AND
ACROSS NORTHERN GA TO CENTRAL AL. THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS A
LITTLE MORE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY THAN YESTERDAY...WITH A MODIFIED
SOUNDING TO 89/67 GIVING MUCAPE VALUES NEAR 2000 J/KG. A MIDLEVEL
SHEAR AXIS OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL ALSO PUSH SOUTH TODAY...AND
PROVIDE ADDITIONAL LIFT FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. THUS EXPECT
BETTER PRECIP COVERAGE TODAY...AND WILL KEEP THE CURRENT FORECAST OF
LIKELY POPS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 1000-850 THICKNESS FROM THE
OHX SOUNDING IS ALSO HIGHER THAN THE PAST FEW DAYS...SO WILL RAISE
HIGH TEMPS SLIGHTLY WITH THE UPDATE...INTO THE LOWER 90S IN THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY. HOWEVER CLOUDS ACROSS THE NORTHERN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A MUGGY AIR MASS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES NEAR TWO 
INCHES. AS A RESULT...EXPECT SOME SCATTERED SEVERE TSTORMS THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS AND LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL. A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF 
THE NATION IS PROGGED TO PUSH THIS COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
BY THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD HELP INCREASE THE AREAL COVERAGE OF 
CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND 
TOWARD THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS TODAY (WHICH HAVE VERIFYING PRETTY 
WELL LATELY)...AND WILL CONTINUE WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST IN 
REGARDS TO MINS FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...COOL FRONT SLOWS DOWN 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY AS LOW FORMS ON THE FRONT OVER 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND SLOWLY SHIFTS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. STAYED WITH STRATIFICATION OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH 
THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE SOUTH FOR THE SLOW MOVEMENT AND POSSIBLE 
DEVELOPMENT NEAR THE BOUNDARY SATURDAY. KEPT THE IDEA OF DECREASING 
PROBABILITIES FOR CONVECTION THROUGH THE DAY INTO THE EVENING AS 
HIGHER PRESSURE BUILDS SOUTH OUT OF THE GREAT LAKES PRESSING FRONT 
INTO THE DEEP SOUTH. NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND HIGHER SURFACE 
PRESSURE WILL ALLOW FOR A DRY SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY PERIOD. HOWEVER 
BY WEDNESDAY LOW LEVEL RIDGING SLIPS FAR ENOUGH SOUTHEAST THAT 
MOISTURE RETURN HAS DEVELOPED AGAIN ON SOUTHERLY WINDS ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF SURFACE HIGH. THEREFORE KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING 
FOR CONVECTION AND THEN STAYED WITH A LOW CHANCE POP NORTH WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH ON THURSDAY AS MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY INCREASE 
AHEAD OF ANOTHER FRONT MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. 
CONCERNING TEMP FORECAST BASICALLY TRENDED A LITTLE WARMER THAN MEX 
MOS AS HIGH SUN ANGLE IN EARLY JULY AND SLIGHTLY LESS HUMID AIRMASS 
SHOULD HEAT FAIRLY EFFICIENTLY ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE WEEK.

...AIDED BY A VERY BUOYANT ATMOSPHERE (POSITIVE CAPES NEAR 2000 J/KG
PER 00Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS). AN ABUNDANCE OF OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES NOTED 
ON RADAR AND SATELLITE PICS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...HAVE ALSO
CERTAINLY AIDED RE-DEVELOPMENT AND INTENSITY. THESE BOUNDARIES HAVE 
VARIED IN SCALE FROM ABOUT ONE COUNTY SIZE TO MULTIPLE COUNTIES.

GOOD COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND STORMS CONTINUES FROM NE PARTS OF 
MIDDLE TN EASTWARD ACROSS THE NRN PLATEAU...WITH THIS ACTIVITY 
MOVING ALMOST DUE EAST TO AFFECT MUCH OF NE TN AND SW VA OVER THE 
NEXT FEW HOURS. HAVE UPDATED GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS ALREADY DUE TO 
HOURLY TEMPS DRIFTING FAR OFF WHERE STORMS HAVE OCCURRED. WILL 
MONITOR RADAR TRENDS OVER THE NEXT HOUR...WITH GOOD POSSIBILITY OF

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN A CONVERGENCE ZONE IN THE PLATEAU 
THIS AFTERNOON. SOME OF THE STORMS WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE 
SOME DAMAGING WINDS AND MAYBE SOME SMALL HAIL. THE EASTWARD MOVEMENT 
OF THE LINE OF STORMS WILL BRING THEM INTO THE VALLEY THIS EVENING. 
STORMS ARE DIURNALLY DRIVEN...AND SO THEY SHOULD DISSIPATE SOMETIME 
AROUND MIDNIGHT. FRIDAY AGAIN LOOKS VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY...BUT THE 
APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH AND WEAKENING ATLANTIC RIDGE SHOULD ALLOW 
FOR BETTER COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW AFTERNOON. 
WILL CONTINUE THE CURRENT FORECAST OF LIKELY POPS. SOME ADDITIONAL 
MORNING CLOUDINESS MAY ALSO SHAVE A FEW DEGREES OFF HIGH 
TEMPS...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHERN SECTIONS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL LIKELY BE ONGOING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA FRIDAY EVENING AS UPPER TROUGH BRINGS A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND SATURDAY. LOOKS LIKE ISOLATED STORMS COULD BE SEVERE AGAIN WITH 
DAMAGING WINDS AND MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL. LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN IS 
POSSIBLE TOO. THE SPEED AND THE STRENGTH OF THE FRONT WILL AFFECT 
RAIN CHANCES ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. THE NAM/WRF IS A LITTLE 
FASTER AND NOT AS STRONG WITH THE FRONT. PREFER THE GFS SO WILL KEEP 
50 PERCENT POPS SOUTH SATURDAY TAPERING TO AROUND 30 PERCENT CHANCE 
ACROSS SW VA EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON. HAVE BROUGHT POPS TO 20 PERCENT 
FOR SOUTHEAST HALF SATURDAY NIGHT. DRIER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND FRONT 
SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AS SURFACE HIGH MOVES DOWN FROM THE 
GREAT LAKES AND UPPER TROUGH LIES ALONG THE APPALACHIANS AND EAST 
COAST. HIGH AND LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER UNTIL 
TUESDAY OR WEDNESDAY. WEDNESDAY RIDGING TAKES OVER AND WILL CONTINUE 
WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM HEATING. 
PRECIPITATION MAY BE CONFINED ONLY IN THE TERRAIN AREAS BUT WILL LET 
LATER SHIFTS MAKE A DECISION TO TAKE POPS OUT OF THE VALLEYS. A 
SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY AS A 
FRONT APPROACHES FROM THE OHIO VALLEY.

DRIFTING SLOWLY EAST.  SATELLITE INDICATING PERSISTENT COLD CLOUD 
TOPS WITH THEM. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THIS MORNING.  BETTER 
CHANCES ARE EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY INCREASING.  COULD SEE A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.  RECENT RAIN FROM 
YESTERDAY SHOULD BRING MORE PATCHY FOG THIS MORNING.  NOT WIDESPREAD 
ENOUGH FOR AN ADVISORY.  TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO 
YESTERDAY...WHICH IS HANDLED WELL BY THE GUIDANCE SO DIDNT STRAY 
TOO FAR.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH BRINGING A COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...AS A 
BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DIGS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
THIS COLD FRONT WILL HELP TO INCREASE THE COVERAGE OF CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...WITH MODERATE INSTABILITY 
DEVELOPING ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THE AFTERNOON. IN 
ADDITION...THE PRECIPITABLE WATER CONTENT OF THE LOCAL AIR MASS IS 
PROGGED TO RISE TO AROUND TWO INCHES. AS A RESULT...WILL CONTINUE 
WITH LIKELY POPS EVERYWHERE FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AND 
ALSO EXPECT A BETTER COVERAGE OF SEVERE STORMS WITH DAMAGING 
DOWNBURST WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. THERE STILL REMAINS SOME 
QUESTION ABOUT HOW QUICKLY THIS COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE 
REGION ON SATURDAY...AND WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST ON 
SATURDAY SINCE FRONTS TYPICALLY MOVE A LITTLE SLOWER THAN PROGGED 
DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS ACROSS THE 
REGION FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH DRY AND SLIGHTLY COOLER CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED. THE MOST NOTICEABLE CHANGE SHOULD BE THE LOWER DEWPOINTS 
BY SUNDAY...RESULTING IN LESS MUGGY CONDITIONS AND LOWER MINS AT 
NIGHT. ANOTHER COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA

.DISCUSSION...
PERSISTENCE WILL LIKELY BE THE BEST FORECAST TODAY AS LITTLE HAS
CHANGED IN THE WEATHER PATTERN IN THE PAST 24 HOURS. A RIDGE OVER
THE ATLANTIC EXTENDS WEST INTO THE APPALACHIAN REGION...WHILE A
TROUGH SLOWLY MOVES EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. INSTABILITY
PARAMETERS FROM THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING...MODIFIED TO 89/66...YIELD
VALUES VERY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...MUCAPE AROUND 1700 J/KG...LI
AROUND -5. EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ALONG THE
ELEVATED HEATING SURFACES OF THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU THIS
AFTERNOON...AND FILL INTO THE VALLEY INTO THE EVENING. A FEW STORMS
COULD PRODUCE SOME DAMAGING WIND GUSTS. POPS WILL BE RAISED
SLIGHTLY WITH THE MORNING UPDATE. TEMPERATURES ARE ON TRACK...AND
1000-850 MB THICKNESS FROM THE OHX SOUNDING IS IDENTICAL TO
YESTERDAY...SO HIGHS WILL AGAIN REACH THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S IN

335 AM EDT WED JUN 27 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LINGERING 
ACROSS THE AREA FROM THE RAIN.  WILL KEEP PATCHY FOG IN FOR THE 
MORNING HOURS.  COULD SEE VISIBILITIES BELOW A MILE IN A FEW 
SPOTS...BUT NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH FOR AN ADVISORY.  ANOTHER WARM DAY 
TODAY...BRINGING SOME DIURNAL INSTABILITY.  MOISTURE MORE LIMITED 
THAN YESTERDAY...BUT WILL PROBABLY SEE MORE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN 
THE MOUNTAINS.  COULD SEE A FEW STRONG STORMS AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING.  STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD 
AGAIN DEVELOP ON THURSDAY...WITH THE BEST CHANCES EXPECTED ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE INSTABILITY SHOULD BE A 
LITTLE HIGHER. GFS MODEL HAS BEEN FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH BRINGING A 
COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...AS A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH DIGS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS COLD FRONT 
SHOULD INCREASE THE COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA...AND WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS EVERYWHERE BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 
THERE REMAINS SOME QUESTION ABOUT HOW QUICKLY THIS FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...AND WILL KEEP POPS IN THE 
FORECAST ON SATURDAY SINCE FRONTS TYPICALLY MOVE A LITTLE SLOWER 
THAN PROGGED DURING THE SUMMER MONTHS. WHILE THIS COLD FRONT WILL 
ONLY BRING A SLIGHT COOLDOWN WITH TEMPS...IT SHOULD BRING A NICE 
DECREASE IN HUMIDITY LEVELS AND CLOUDS. DRY WEATHER SHOULD DEVELOP 
BY SUNDAY AND CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY.

227 PM EDT TUE JUN 26 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...
CONVECTION A LITTLE ON THE SUPPRESSED SIDE RIGHT NOW BUT SURFACE 
WILL CONTINUE TO HEAT UP. APPARENTLY UPPER RIDGING WITH AXIS EAST OF 
THE WFO IS HAVING MORE OF AN INFLUENCE ON SUPPRESSING DEVELOPMENT 
WHICH IS WHAT WE WERE FORECASTING TO OCCUR FOR THIS TIME PERIOD A 
FEW DAYS AGO. THE BEST COVERAGE IS IN THE TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER. MAY TWEAK PREVIOUS FORECAST FOR TONIGHT BASED ON 
TRENDS. BASICALLY STAYED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR 
CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY BUT BUMPED UP MAJOR TERRAIN AREAS DUE TO 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT. CONCERNING TEMPERATURE FORECAST STAYED QUITE CLOSE 
TO BLEND OF GUIDANCE.
 
.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO GIVE WAY ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY AS AN UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE NORTHWEST. EXPECT 
ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED TO ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON 
THURSDAY...WITH THE BEST CHANCES NORTH WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE A 
LITTLE BETTER. MOISTURE ADVECTION INCREASES ON FRIDAY AHEAD OF THE 
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES RISE 
TO OVER 1.7 INCHES WITH MLCAPES NEAR 1500 J/KG...AND MODELS SHOW A 
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH OVER THE AREA ON FRIDAY. GIVEN THE 
INSTABILITY...SOME POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE STORMS WILL EXIST. WILL 
RAISE POPS TO LIKELY IN THE NORTH. THE FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA 
FRIDAY NIGHT...AND MORE STABLE AIR SHOULD BEGIN TO INFILTRATE THE 
NORTH ON SATURDAY. THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS WILL BE MOVING THROUGH ON 
SATURDAY...SO HIGHEST POPS WILL BE IN THE SOUTH. THE FRONT WILL PUSH 
THROUGH THE AREA AND END ALL POPS BY MIDNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT.

THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA...AND HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
SLOWLY DROP SOUTH OUT OF CANADA...BRINGING DRIER AIR TO THE REGION. 
SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WILL BE DRY WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR TO 
SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.

TO SHOW A STRONG BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC EXTENDING 
ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION...WITH A WARM AND 
MUGGY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. OVERALL...LOCAL AIR MASS HAS 
NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE YESTERDAY...AND EXPECT TODAY TO BE VERY 
SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS DEVELOPING AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE TSTORMS AS A DRY BOUNDARY LAYER (INVERTED-V 
SHAPED SOUNDING) LINGERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS DRY BOUNDARY 
LAYER SHOULD AGAIN HELP TO PRODUCE STRONG DOWNBURST WINDS WITH SOME 
STORMS...AND WITH AN OVERALL HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER CONTENT NEAR 
1.75...SOME STORMS MAY PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. AS FOR 
TEMPS...SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE TO MAKE FORECASTING THE 
MAXES TRICKY...AND WILL GENERALLY KEEP TODAYS MAXES NEAR THE 
AVERAGE MAX TEMP FROM THE PAST FEW DAYS. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...DIURNAL INSTABILITY REMAINS 
FAIRLY HIGH ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY BUT MOISTURE AND LIFT REMAINS 
WEAK. SHOULD SEE MORE SCATTERED AFTERNOON AND EVENING THUNDERSTORMS 
ON BOTH WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. COLD FRONT DROPPING INTO AREA ON 
FRIDAY...BRINGING AN INCREASE OF MOISTURE AND LIFT WITH IT. WILL GO 
WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY. FRONT LINGERING INTO SATURDAY...

SUMMERTIME...AIRMASS HAS SETTLED OVER THE REGION BRINGING MORE
TYPICAL AFTERNOON AND EVENING PULSE THUNDERSTORMS. WITH THE
INSTABILITY OF THE ATMOSPHERE AND WITH SOME DRY AIR ALOFT TO HELP
INTENSIFY STORMS...EXPECT SOME OF THESE THUNDERSTORMS TO BECOME
SEVERE. HAVE TWEAKED POPS JUST SLIGHTLY UPWARDS AND HAVE CHANGED
WORDING THROUGH NEXT SEVERAL DAYS FROM CHANCE TO SCATTERED TO
REFLECT REALITY.

IN THE LONGER TERM...A STRONG UPPER TROF AND SURFACE FRONT LOOKS 
GOOD TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION ON FRIDAY INCREASING THE CHANCE OF 
STORMS.  HAVE INCREASED POPS TO THE 50S RANGE AND WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED IF THAT INCREASED FURTHER AS TIME PROGRESSES.  

AFTER THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON FRIDAY NIGHT DRIER AIR COMES INTO 
PLAY AND HAVE LOWERED POPS BEHIND THE SYSTEM.  TEMPERATURES WILL SEE 
A LITTLE MODIFICATION POST FRONTAL BUT NOT MUCH.

GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE PERIOD APPEAR REASONABLE SO DID NOT

TODAY BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS SO WILL TRIM THE HIGH END OF WARMING

AIR MASS REMAINS UNCHANGED FROM YESTERDAY. THINK THAT ONLY SCATTERED 
CONVECTION COULD POSSIBLY KEEP MAXES FROM REACHING YESTERDAYS

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MORE OF THE SAME. THE RIDGE 
BUILDS AS THE MODELS HAVE INDICATED FOR WHAT SEEMS LIKE MONTHS. 
BERMUDA HIGH AFFECTS SOUTHEAST US WHICH WILL KEEP CURRENTLY RISING 
DEWPOINTS HIGH THROUGH MID-WEEK. POPS NOT ALL THAT HIGH, AND OVERALL 
QPFS WILL STILL BE ON THE LOW SIDE, BUT SPOTS WILL GET HEAVY RAIN, 
PERHAPS EVEN FLOODING AS HAPPENED TONIGHT. FOR INSTANCE, OAK RIDGE 
TRACED OUT, WHILE TYS GOT 0.81. SO THE HAVES WILL STILL HAVE AND 
THE HAVE-NOTS WILL HAVE NOT. 

LAPSE IN POPS LATER IN WEEK, BUT FRONT APPROACHES AREA BY THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...CELLS POPPING RATHER 
QUICKLY NOW MAINLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS...WITH POTENTIAL TO 
PULSE TO SEVERE LEVELS. ACTIVITY TODAY DOES NOT HAVE AN E TO W OR NW 
TO SE ORIENTATION...SO WEAK BOUNDARY HAS PROBABLY DISSIPATED OR 
MOVED NORTH OF THE AREA. UPPER LOW OVER SRN IL/SRN IN/W KY PLUS 
STRONG HEATING...SHOULD RESULT IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS INTO 
THE EVENING HOURS. PREVIOUS GRIDS WERE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY BUT STILL 
LOOKED GREAT.

ADJUSTMENTS MADE FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WERE TO REMOVE MOST 
AREAS AND TIME PERIODS WHERE A DRY FORECAST WAS NOTED. THE DEPTH OF 
MOISTURE AND STRONG HEATING THESE PERIODS JUSTIFIES 20 TO 40 PERCENT 
POPS UNTIL TUESDAY...WHERE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WERE USED ACROSS THE 
BOARD...DUE TO LESS MOISTURE AND BUILDING OF UPPER RIDGE.

FOR TEMPS...A MOS BLEND FROM NAM-WRF WITH GFS LOOKED BEST FOR MINS.
CONTINUED TREND OF GOING A DEGREE OR SO ABOVE THE MOS FOR MAX TEMPS
...BASED ON MOS PERFORMANCE LATELY (INCLUDING TODAY AS 17Z TEMP GRID 
HAD TO BE RAISED FROM 1 TO 3 DEGREES IN MOST AREAS).


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER RIDGE FORMS ACROSS 
THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION WITH EXTENSION WEST INTO THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON WEDNESDAY. MODELS SHOW ATMOSPHERE BECOMES 
SLIGHTLY MORE MOIST AND UNSTABLE DURING MID WEEK SO GRADUALLY 
INCREASE AREAL COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY WITH HIGHEST POPS FRIDAY/SATURDAY AS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY BUILDS SOUTH INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. TAPERED POPS BACK SOMEWHAT ON SUNDAY AS FRONTAL 
POSITION MAY HAVE FINALLY MOVED SOUTH TO NEAR THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE 
BORDER. OF COURSE AT THESE EXTENDED TIME PERIODS DETAILS ARE MURKY

ACROSS WRN KY AND MOVING NE INTO THE OH VALLEY REGION.  ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER SE KY WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS SW VA FOR THE 
NEXT FEW HOURS.

AT THE SURFACE...THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY HAS BECOME VERY TOUGH TO 
LOCATE...AS DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE RISEN INTO THE LOWER 60S AS FAR 
NORTH AS SW VA.  MODIFIED OHX AND RNK 12Z SOUNDINGS PRODUCE MODERATE 
INSTABILITY WITH POSITIVE CAPE VALUES OF 1500 TO 2500 J/KG.  LOOKS 
LIKE A FEW STORMS WILL PULSE UP THIS AFTERNOON AND BRIEFLY GO SEVERE 
(HAIL AND DOWNBURST THREAT) BEFORE COLLAPSING GIVEN THE VERY WEAK 
WINDS ALOFT.

THE CURRENT RAIN CHANCES LOOK GOOD WITH HIGHEST CHANCE NORTHEAST 
DOWN TO SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE FAR SOUTHWEST (SEQUATCHIE VALLEY).
TEMPS OFF TO A GOOD START ALREADY...SO SHOULD SEE HIGHS NEAR

WEAK AND DIFFUSE FRONTAL BOUNDARY BISECTING THE FORECAST AREA...WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S MOST EVERYWHERE EXCEPT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA. 
THIS WEAK BOUNDARY SHOULD SLOWLY DRIFT NORTH INTO NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA BY THIS AFTERNOON...BEFORE ULTIMATELY WASHING-OUT BY 
TONIGHT. MODELS INDICATE THAT A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL 
DEVELOP OVER PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH 
SCATTERED CONVECTION AGAIN DEVELOPING...ESPECIALLY NEAR THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. THUS...WILL MENTION THE 
HIGHEST POPS ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. WITH A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS AND A DRY INVERTED-V BOUNDARY LAYER ON THE MODEL 
SOUNDINGS...THINK THAT A FEW ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS WITH DAMAGING 
WINDS AND LARGE HAIL WILL AGAIN BE POSSIBLE. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
GENERALLY TREND TOWARD A PERSISTENCE FORECAST...BUT WITH HIGHER MINS 
ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA AS DEWPOINTS SLOWLY RISE. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS HAVE BEEN ADVERTISING 
THE SAME THING FOR DAYS. UPPER RIDGE ESTABLISHES ITSELF OVER EASTERN 
CONUS WITH SFC BERMUDA-LIKE HIGH PRESSURE OFFSHORE. THIS OPENS UP 
THE SOUTHEAST TO MORE MOISTURE THROUGH MID WEEK. SOMETIME AROUND 
FRIDAY, A FRONTAL ZONE MOVES SOUTHEAST TOWARD REGION, BUT TIME OF

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
314 PM EDT SAT JUN 23 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SIDE TRACKED A BIT BY 
ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED STORMS THAT DEVELOPED OVER THE PAST HOUR
...AND RAPIDLY PULSED UP TO SEVERE LEVELS. PENNY SIZE HAIL WITH 
STORM IN ROANE COUNTY...AND HALF DOLLAR SIZE HAIL ALONG RHEA AND 
MEIGS COUNTY LINE WHERE STORM WAS EVEN MORE DEVELOPED. DEWPOINT 
TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 60S ACROSS E TN COUNTIES...AND THESE STORMS 
MAY BE FIRING ON THE ACTUAL OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY.

FOR TONIGHT...RAISED POPS A BIT FOR PLATEAU COUNTIES AND KEPT AT 
LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALL AREAS THROUGH MIDNIGHT...AS ACTIVITY 
SHOULD BE MAINLY DIURNAL. GFS MOS MINS HAVE BEEN QUITE CLOSE LATELY
SO NO REASON TO STRAY FROM.

SUNDAY THRU MONDAY...MOISTURE INCREASES SLIGHTLY WITH THE EXPECTED 
INCREASE IN INSTABILITY BOTH DAYS...SO AT LEAST SOME DIURNAL 
CONVECTION...ALTHO COVERAGE SHOULD BELOW 50 PERCENT. LOW LEVEL FLOW 
BECOMES MORE SOUTHERLY BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...SO EXPECT BETTER LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE CONVERGENCE THEN. THUS...ADDED AND/OR INCREASED POPS 
FOR THESE PERIODS. STILL THINK WARMEST MOS MAX TEMPS WILL VERIFY 
BEST THRU SUNDAY...THEN THE MOISTURE INCREASE MAY KEEP MAX TEMPS 
CLOSER TO GFS FOR MONDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...RIDGE ESTABLISHES 
ITSELF ACROSS THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC REGION WITH EXTENSION WEST INTO 
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
DURING WHICH TIME GRADUALLY INCREASE AREAL COVERAGE OF CONVECTION 
FROM TERRAIN AREAS OF SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE ON TUESDAY THROUGH MUCH OF 
THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES ON WEDNESDAY. BY THURSDAY RIDGE HAS 
SHIFTED FAR ENOUGH EAST TO WARRANT RAISING POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA AS SOUTHERLY FLOW ON BACK SIDE OF RIDGE AND INCREASING 
INSTABILITY AHEAD OF STRENGTHENING EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROF ALLOWS 
FOR BETTER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION. BY FRIDAY SURFACE COLD FRONT MAKES 
ITS WAY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
AND WENT AHEAD AND TRIED TO ALERT THE RECREATING PUBLIC TO THE 
POSSIBILITY OF MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION IN ASSOCIATION WITH COLD 
FRONT BY USING 30-40 PERCENT POPS AREA WIDE. FRONT MAY NOT BE ABLE 
TO MAKE IT ALL THE WAY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS LATE IN JUNE 
SO KEPT CHANCE POPS GOING ON SATURDAY. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE TEMPS WHICH KEEP 90 DEGREE HEAT GOING THROUGH MID WEEK 
BEFORE DROPPING BACK INTO THE 80S LATE WEEK IN DEEP MOISTURE REGIME 
AHEAD OF FRONT.

.DISCUSSION...12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS MODIFIED FOR HIGHS IN THE 80S TO 
LOWER 90S YIELDS UNSTABLE CONDITIONS...WITH POSITIVE CAPE OF 1000 TO 
1500 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES OF -5. HOWEVER...A SIGNIFICANT TRIGGER 
DOES SEEM TO BE LACKING TODAY...SUCH THAT 20 TO 30 PERCENT CHANCES 
ARE QUITE SUFFICIENT. LITTLE TO NO SHEAR WITH FREEZING AND WET BULB 
ZERO HEIGHTS ALSO QUITE HIGH...SO NOT MUCH THREAT OF ANY STRONG 
STORMS.

THE WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER IOWA TO UPPER MIDWEST STATES MAY NOT 
AFFECT OUR CHANCES OF CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION...AS MODELS AGREE ON 
THIS FEATURE WEAKENING AND STAYING WELL TO OUR WEST WITH TIME. AT 
THE SURFACE...LATEST 13Z CHART SHOWS WEAK FRONT TO OUR SOUTH AND 
ANOTHER OVER MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. MOST CONVECTION THIS MORNING IS 
ASSOCIATED WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION NE OF THE MISSISIPPI VALLEY FRONT.

THUS...FORECAST APPEARS ON TRACK FOR TODAY WITH JUST A COSMETIC 
UPDATE TO ZFPMRX PRODUCT TO REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING. WILL ALSO 
FRESHEN GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS IF HOURLY CONDITIONS DRIFT TOO FAR 
FROM REALITY.

300 AM EDT SAT JUN 23 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG A ST LOUIS TO CHATTANOOGA TO 
CHARLOTTE LINE...WITH A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE COMPLEX OCCURRING OVER 
CENTRAL ILLINOIS. THIS MCC SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE SOUTHEAST THIS 
MORNING WITH NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...BUT WEAKEN AS IT ENCOUNTERS 
DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD CONTINUE TO 
LINGER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...AS WEAK UPPER-LEVEL RIDGING 
BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION. BOTH THE GFS AND WRF MODELS SEEM TO AGREE 
THAT THE LOCAL AIR MASS WILL BE TOO DRY TO SUPPORT ANY POSSIBLE MCS 
ACTIVITY FROM THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. THUS...WILL CONTINUE WITH 
ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARD A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST...BUT WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER MAXES ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MINS SHOULD BE HIGHER TONIGHT 
AREAWIDE AS DEWPOINTS CONTINUE TO SLOWLY RISE. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN FEATURE IS MODERATE TO 
STRONG UPPER RIDGE OVER CENTRAL U.S. NORTHWEST FLOW ON FRONT SIDE OF 
RIDGE IS AFFECTING THE REGION AND ALLOWING SOME WEAKNESSES IN THE 
FLOW TO FLOW THIS WAY. HOWEVER, INSTABILITY, MOISTURE, AND LIFT ARE 
ALL QUITE LIMITED AND THIS WILL CONTINUE INTO MIDDLE OF WEEK. RIDGE 
WILL BUILD AND MOVE SLIGHTLY EAST. FEATURES TAKE ON A QUASI-BERMUDA 
HIGH CHARACTER AND EXPECT INCREASE IN RH, TEMPS. STILL INSTABILITY 
WILL BE LIMITED AND THIS WILL INHIBIT CONVECTION. POPS WILL REMAIN 
AT MID SUMMER LEVELS WITH MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE RANGES THROUGH PERIOD.
DROUGHT CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST.

.DISCUSSION...EARLIER SHOWERS OR SPRINKLES HAVE JUST ABOUT ENDED 
ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA AS A VORTICITY MAXIMUM SLIDES SOUTHEAST FROM 
KY THROUGH NE TN AND SW VA INTO NC. A WEAK COLD FRONT LIES OVER THE 
SAME AREA AND WILL DROP SLOWLY SOUTHWEST OVERNIGHT. WILL LEAVE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR THE EVENING NEAR THE FRONT OTHERWISE

300 PM EDT FRI JUN 22 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH 
MCS CONTINUES TO GENERALLY WEAKEN AS IT MOVES SE. REMNANTS OF THE 
UPPER LEVEL CIRCULATION HAVE YET TO PASS ACROSS THE EXTREME NE PARTS 
OF OUR FORECAST AREA...AND ALSO APPEARS THAT AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY MAY 
HAVE BEEN LEFT ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. 

ATMOSPHERE STARTING TO DESTABILIZE ACROSS THE AREA AS MAX TEMPS HAVE 
REACHED 80S TO LOWER 90S...THUS WONT TOTALLY GIVE UP ON SOME 
CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION DEVELOPING THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...VISIBLE 
SATELLITE PICS SHOWED THE BEST DEVELOPING CUMULUS CLOUDS WELL TO OUR 
WEST OVER SW KY AND W TN...WHERE THE BEST LOW LEVEL THETA-E VALUES 
WERE NOTED. GIVEN THE NW FLOW ALOFT...AND MODELS POOR HANDLING OF 
WHERE MCS ACTIVITY HAS BEEN DEVELOPING AND OCCURRING TODAY...WONT 
LIMIT RAIN CHANCES TO JUST DIURNAL.

FOR SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY...NOT VERY CONFIDENT THAT THE WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY TO OUR NORTH WILL ACTUALLY DROP INTO OR THRU OUR FORECAST 
AREA. HOWEVER...NW FLOW ALOFT AND DAYTIME INSTABILITY WILL JUSTIFY 
TOKEN POPS OF ROUGHLY 20-30 PERCENT OVER THE WEEKEND. GOING WITH OR 
ABOVE THE WARMEST MOS MAX TEMPS HAS WORKED WELL...EVEN TODAY WITH 
DEBRIS CLOUDS FROM MCS ACROSS NRN AREAS...SO CARRIED THIS INTO THE 
WEEKEND AS WELL. HAVE NOT NOTICED ANY REAL MOS BIAS FOR MIN TEMPS
...SO STUCK CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR MINS EACH NIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODEL DEPICTION OF RIDGE 
POSITION A BIT FARTHER EAST THAN WHAT WAS OFFERED YESTERDAY FOR THE 
MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. LOOKS A LITTLE LESS 
SUBSIDENT AND A LITTLE MORE HUMID. THERE MAY BE ENOUGH OROGRAPHIC 
LIFT TO WORK WITH SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY TO ALLOW A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM TO FORM ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE OR THE MAJOR TERRAIN 
AREAS SO KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION HERE. ATMOSPHERE MOISTENS 
MORE SIGNIFICANTLY ON THURSDAY WITH INDICATION OF WEAK SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY AS NORTHEASTERN U.S. TROF STRENGTHENS. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AND BROADBRUSHED LOW 
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE BOARD FOR POSSIBLE FROPA. DID NOT STRAY TOO 
FAR FROM GUIDANCE TEMPS.

940 AM EDT FRI JUN 22 2007

.DISCUSSION...MAIN FEATURE OF CONCERN IS THE MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE 
SYSTEM (MCS) ACROSS MUCH OF INDIANA AND OHIO THIS MORNING. THIS 
SYSTEM WILL BE ENCOUNTERING A DRY AIRMASS OVER THE TN VALLEY AND SRN 
APPALACHIANS TODAY...ALTHO MODIFIED 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS DID 
INDICATE SOME INSTABILITY (POSITIVE CAPES OF 800 TO 1000 J/KG AND 
LIFTED INDICES OF -3 TO -5) FOR AFTERNOON HIGHS IN THE 80S TO LOWER 
90S. FREEZING AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS REMAIN ON THE HIGH SIDE...
WITH SOUNDINGS SHOWING SOME POTENTIAL FOR STRONG DOWNBURST WINDS.

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT THE MOST UNSTABLE AIRMASS WILL BE 
ASSOCIATED WITH LOW LEVEL THETA-E RIDGE ACROSS WRN KY AND NW TN...
WHICH IS WHERE THE BEST CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT HAS BEEN THIS MORNING.
THUS...CLEARLY AT LEAST A CHANCE OF AFTERNOON CONVECTION FOR PARTS 
OF OUR REGION (PLATEAU/SW VA/NE TN) WHERE CHANCE POPS ARE IN THE 
FORECAST. 

CLOUDS ON EASTERN END OF MCS ARE DISSIPATING...BUT DEBRIS CLOUDINESS 
MAY AFFECT MAX TEMPS FOR SW VA AND NE TN. WILL MONITOR RADAR AND 
SATELLITE TRENDS...WITH ZFPMRX UPDATE AND A FRESHENING OF GRIDS AND 
WEB PRODUCTS SHORTLY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A MESOSCALE 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX OCCURRING ALONG IT OVER CENTRAL ILLINOIS. WITH 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...THIS MCC SHOULD CONTINUE MOVING SOUTHEAST 
ALONG THE COLD FRONT AND INTO SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN BY THIS 
AFTERNOON. MODELS INDICATE THAT A DRY AIR MASS WILL LINGER OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT WITH SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY 
DEVELOPING. THUS...WHILE THE DRIER AIR OVER THE FORECAST AREA MAY 
WEAKEN THE MCC SOME AS IT APPROACHES...THINK THAT THERE WILL BE 
ENOUGH FUEL TO GENERATE SOME ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT AS 
THE MCCS AREA OF VORTICITY MOVES ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...WILL PLAN TO RAISE POPS INTO THE 
CHANCE CATEGORY ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. WILL ALSO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME ISOLATED SEVERE TSTORMS WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL IN 
THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. AS FOR TEMPS...AN EXPECTED INCREASE 
IN CLOUD COVER OVER THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD KEEP TEMPS A LITTLE 
COOLER (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...REALLY SMALL TWEAKS TO 
FORECAST. ADJUSTED QPFS DOWN A HAIR IN NEAR TERM (SATURDAY). NOT TO 
SAY THAT SOME THUNDERSTORMS WILL NOT DROP A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF 
RAIN ON A SPECIFIC SPOT...BUT MEAN AREA QUANTITIES WILL BE VERY 
SMALL. NO DROUGHT BUSTING RAINS IN SIGHT. RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD 
AS SUMMER INVADES. IF SPRING WAS ANY INDICATION...SUMMER WILL BE 
BRUTAL. THIS NEXT WEEK HINTS AT ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS AND LITTLE RAIN. 
LOOKS LIKE AUGUST ALREADY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...WATER VAPOR SATELLITE 
PICS SHOW A VERY DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH ANY CONVECTION WELL UPSTREAM TO OUR NW OVER THE 
UPPER MIDWEST STATES. NOT MUCH WAY FOR EVEN ANY DEBRIS CIRRUS CLOUDS 
TO REACH US OVERNIGHT. EXPECT CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH MINS LIKELY 
TO BE NEAR GFS MOS VALUES OR A COUPLE OF DEGREES ABOVE GIVEN SLIGHT 
COOL BIAS FROM LAST NIGHT.

MODELS STILL HINT AT SOME ORGANIZED CONVECTION TO EVENTUALLY DEVELOP 
IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT...BUT TIMING SUCH FEATURES IS UNCERTAIN...AND 
ALSO WOULD SEEM THAT ANY APPROACHING SYSTEMS WOULD BE WEAKENING UPON 
NEARING OUR FORECAST AREAS. HOWEVER...DO AGREE WITH NEIGHBORING 
OFFICES AND GENERAL TREND IN MOS GUIDANCE FOR BEST CHANCES (STILL 
RATHER LOW THOUGH) OF RAIN ACROSS OUR NRN MOST AREAS THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. BY SATURDAY...KEPT THE BROADBRUSH OF 20-30 PERCENT POPS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...SURFACE BOUNDARY MAY PUSH 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AND LEAVE EVEN LESS CHANCES FOR SATURDAY. 

OTHERWISE...FOLLOWED THE RECENT TREND FOR MAX TEMPS AT OR JUST ABOVE 
THE WARMEST MOS...GIVEN MOS COOL BIAS ON HIGHS OF LATE. DEW POINT 
TEMPS WERE BLENDED FROM GFS AND NAM-WRF...KEEPING LOWER DAYTIME 
VALUES DUE TO DRY AIRMASS AND MIXING.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAINTAINED SOME 
CHANCE POPS NORTHERN ZONES WITH SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT 
AS MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW WEAK SHORTWAVES DROPPING SOUTHEAST ACROSS 
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH BACKDOOR COLD FRONT IN 
THE VICINITY. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ON SUNDAY AS 
ATMOSPHERE NOT ENTIRELY STABILIZED WITH BUILDING EASTERN STATES 
RIDGE. RIDGING EXERTS INFLUENCE MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND KEPT POPS OUT 
OF THE FORECAST FOR MOST OF THE AREA WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE 
TERRAIN AREAS IN TENNESSEE AND WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA ON MONDAY AND 
THEN MAINLY SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE ON TUESDAY. RIDGE EDGES SLOWLY EAST 
ALLOWING FOR INCREASINGLY SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL COMPONENT TO THE FLOW 
SO CRANKED UP SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO GET THE CONVECTION GOING 
AGAIN DURING THIS LATE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. GUIDANCE TEMPS 
INDICATE WARMING TREND WITH STRENGTHENING RIDGING FOR SUNDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY WITH INCREASING HUMIDITY AND WEAKENING SUBSIDENCE PRODUCING 
SLIGHTLY LOWER MAX TEMPS ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD FRONT NOW MOVING INTO
EASTERN KY AND MIDDLE TN EARLY THIS MORNING WITH PRE FRONTAL
PRECIPITATION WELL IN ADVANCE IN SOUTHWEST VA JUST EAST OF THE CWA
AND WESTERN NC. PATCHY FOG IS FORMING IN SW VA AND EAST TN NOW AND
MAY BECOME LOCALLY DENSE BEFORE DRIER AIR LAGGING BEHIND THE FRONT
MOVES IN LATER THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE 60S AT THIS
TIME. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FROM THE NORTHWEST TODAY AND
SKIES SHOULD CLEAR QUICKLY THIS MORNING. RAINFALL AMOUNTS YESTERDAY
WERE HELPFUL BUT GROUND STILL QUITE DRY AND EXPECT TEMPERATURES TO
REACH THE MID 80S TO NEAR 90 IN THE VALLEYS WITH COOLER 70S FOR THE
MOUNTAINS. GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE WARMER GFS MOS TODAY FOR HIGHS. 
TONIGHT LOWS WILL BE IN THE 50S AS DRIER AIR REPLACES THE MOIST
AIR IN PLACE NOW.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LARGE SCALE MID TO UPPER
LEVEL RIDGE WILL REMAIN FIXED OVER THE SOUTHWEST TO SOUTH CENTRAL
CONUS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SLIDES SE
ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH FRIDAY. SHORT WAVE ENERGY TRAVELS EAST OVER
RIDGING AND THEN DROPS SE INTO OH VLY ON SAT. MCSS ARE LIKELY TO
DEVELOP ON NE EDGE OF RIDGE AND APPROACH THE MRX CWA FROM THE NW
THIS WEEKEND. LOW CONFIDENCE IN EXACT PATH OF THESE SYSTEMS WITH
GREAT VARIABILITY IN MODEL THICKNESS PATTERN THIS RUN. BUMPED UP
CLOUD COVER AND POP CHC N AREAS. PWS INCREASE TO ABOVE NORMAL FOR
THE WEEKEND SO WIDELY SCT AFTN TSTMS ON TAP AREAWIDE. SHORT WAVES
SHEAR OUT OR SHIFT SE OF AREA BY MON AND RIDGING BUILDS IN THROUGH
NEXT MID WEEK. PWS REMAIN HIGH MON SO HAVE MENTION OF ISOLD

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT STILL WEST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...GENERALLY ALONG A NASHVILLE TO CINCINNATI LINE. THIS 
COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA AROUND MIDNIGHT...AND 
BE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE AREA BY SUNRISE. EARLIER CONVECTION ALONG 
THE FRONT HAS NEARLY COMPLETELY DIMINISHED WITH THE SETTING OF THE 
SUN...AND PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA IS RAPIDLY 
DIMINISHING AS WELL. AS A RESULT...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST 
LATER THIS EVENING TO LOWER POPS AND MENTION ONLY ISOLATED OVERNIGHT
CONVECTION...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE.

158 PM EDT TUE JUN 19 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS IN
ADVANCE OF A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS
AFTERNOON INTO THE EARLY EVENING HOURS. AT PRESENT IT APPEARS MOST
AREAS WILL SEE BETWEEN A QUARTER AND HALF AN INCH WITH SOME AREAS
RECEIVING A LITTLE MORE...MAINLY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE AREA.
ISOLATED 1 INCH OR MORE SHOWERS MAY ALSO ACCOMPANY THIS LINE.

RAIN SHOULD CLEAR OVERNIGHT AND SUNNY SKIES RETURN FOR WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A MID TO UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE 
CENTRAL CONUS THIS PERIOD...PUTTING THE APPALACHIAN REGION IN A 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW PATTERN. A SURFACE HIGH WILL BE OVER THE AREA 
FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...PROVIDING DRY WEATHER AND WARM 
TEMPERATURES. THE UPPER RIDGE GIVES WAY SLIGHTLY ON SATURDAY AS A 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH ROUNDS THE RIDGE. THE GFS IS LIKELY OVERDEVELOPING 
THIS FEATURE DUE TO CONVECTIVE FEEDBACK FROM AN MCS OVER THE 
PLAINS...BUT OTHER MODELS DO SHOW AT LEAST A WEAK TROUGH APPROACHING 
FOR THE WEEKEND. CONFIDENCE IS LOW IN TIMING SUCH A FEATURE...SO 
WILL LEAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN FOR BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. THE 
UPPER RIDGE SHIFTS TO THE EAST ON MONDAY AND WILL BE OVERHEAD ON 
TUESDAY...SO HOT AND DRY CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED FOR THE 
BEGINNING OF THE NEXT WORK WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...THE COLD FRONT IS DIFFICULT TO DETECT IN ANYTHING 
OTHER THAN THE WIND FIELD AND APPEARS TO BE LOCATED ALONG THE 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER.  SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN ADVANCE OF THE 
FRONT ARE CURRENTLY IN MIDDLE TENNESSEE...AND WILL LIKELY ADVANCE 
SOME THEN MOVE THROUGH WITH THE UPPER LEVEL DISTRUBANCE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

DIFFERENCES IN THE MODELS LEAVE SOME QUESTIONS ABOUT THE FORECAST.  
EARLIER MODELS INDICATED MUCH OF THE MOISTURE WOULD BE CUT OFF BY 
THE MCS CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH NORTH MISSISSIPPI...HOWEVER LATEST 
NAM INDICATES THAT SYSTEM DISIPATING ALLOWING THE MOISTURE TO MOVE 
INTO THE AREA.  IF THIS OCCURS...RAINFALL AMOUNTS WOULD GENERALLY BE 
AROUND A HALF INCH WITH HIGHER AMOUNTS IN NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.  IF 
THE MCS HOLDS TOGETHER AND CUTS OFF THE MOISTURE...A TENTH INCH 
WOULD BE MORE LIKELY.

ALL THIS TO SAY THAT EITHER WAY...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS ON 
TRACK AND NO CHANGES PLANNED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE CONTINUES OVER SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING. SURFACE 
TROUGH OR PSEUDO WARM FRONT LAYS ALONG S TN RVR VLY. COLD FRONT 
REMAINS WEST OF THE MID MS RVR VLY EARLY TODAY. TWO SHORT WAVE 
BEGINNING TO PHASE VCNTY N MS/W TN WHILE MAIN TROUGH EXTENDS S INTO 
N CNTRL PLAINS. THIS IS PRECURSOR TO LIKELY PCPN EVENT TODAY AND 
TONIGHT ACROSS THE AREA. LOW LEVEL BOUNDARY IN THE WARM SECTOR WILL 
MOVE NORTH THROUGH THE TN VLY TDY. PWS INCREASE TO NEAR 2.00.  AS 
SHORT WAVES MOVE EAST...SUFFICIENT LIFT SETS UP OVER E TN/S APPS 
LATER THIS AFTERNOON. PCPN COVERAGE SHOULD BECOME WIDESPREAD BY LATE 
AFTN. CLOUD COVER WILL HOLD TEMPS DOWN TO LIMIT DESTABILIZATION BUT 
INSTABILITY WILL BECOME MODERATE. TEMPS ALOFT RELATIVELY WARM AND 
SHEAR IS WEAK SO SEVERE TSTMS NOT ANTICIPATED. SHORT WAVES MOVE 
THROUGH AREA THIS EVENING. MEAN TROUGH AND COLD FRONT MOVE EAST 
THROUGH AREA LATE TONIGHT. PCPN CONTINUES UNTIL AROUND DAY BREAK. 
DESPITE DROUGHT CONDITIONS RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD RANGE FROM ONE 
HALF TO ONE INCH. MUCH IS DEPENDENT ON HOW MUCH DEEPER CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE SOUTH ROBS AVAILABLE MOISTURE.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...AFTER COLD FRONT TUESDAY 
NIGHT RIDGING TO THE WEST WILL BRING HIGHER PRESSURE WITH A 
NORTHWEST FLOW TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WEDNESDAY WITH DRIER AIRMASS 
AND NORTHERLY WINDS.  MODELS DROP DEW POINTS 10 TO 15 DEGREES INTO 
THE 50S.  GFS/WRF MODEL GUIDANCE HAS HIGHS IN LOWER TO MID 80S 
WEDNESDAY WITH NGM SEVERAL DEGREES HIGHER.  RAISED CURRENT GRIDS A 
DEGREE OR TWO WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE NGM GIVEN DRY GROUND AND DRY 
AIRMASS AND DID THE SAME THURSDAY.  LARGE SCALE PATTERN HAS UPPER 
RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL STATES BUT A LOBE EXTENDS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST WITH TROUGHS IN THE NE AND NW THROUGH THE WEEKEND.   
PATTERN CHANGES SLIGHTLY OVER THE WEEKEND AS A WEAK TROUGH/FRONT 
MOVES THROUGH THE NORTHWEST FLOW TO GIVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS.  MONDAY THE RIDGE STRENGTHENS EVEN MORE OVER THE 
OHIO VALLEY SOUTH TO THE GULF COAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...AN UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT
PLAINS STATES IS CREATING MINOR UPPER LEVEL DISTRUBANCES THAT ARE
MOVING ACROSS THE REGION. THESE IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE DAYTIME
HEATING IS CAUSING SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON THAT WILL
CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING HOURS THEN DIMINISH AS THE HEATING OF THE
DAY DECREASES. A SURFACE FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UPPER FEATURE
WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY BRINGING AN INCREASED CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS ON TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE SURFACE COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA
ON TUESDAY NIGHT. THE MODELS SEEM TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT NOW THAT
THE FRONT WILL HAVE ENOUGH OF A PUSH BEHIND IT TO CLEAR THE
MOUNTAINS. POPS WILL TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO EAST TUESDAY
NIGHT...WITH NO POPS AFTER 12Z WEDNESDAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
SETTLES OVER THE AREA WITH A DRY NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT ON WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY. WILL REMOVE THE MENTION OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AS
FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE STABLE AND DRY. TEMPS COOL SLIGHTLY BEHIND
THE FRONT...WITH HIGHS IN THE 80S...BUT 90S CAN BE EXPECTED AGAIN
BY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY IN THE VALLEY. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND
SURFACE FRONT APPROACH THE AREA SATURDAY...MOVING THROUGH ON
SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY. CONFIDENCE IS LOW WITH SUCH SMALL SCALE
FEATURES THIS FAR OUT...BUT WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN FOR
THE WEEKEND.

BEGIN TO INCREASE TOMORROW...BUT THINK INSTABILITY WILL STILL BE

TRUNCATE POPS AT LIKELY RATHER THAN THE CATEGORICAL POPS THAT GFS 
PROJECTS FOR THE SOUTHERN TIER.

MAIN UNCERTAINTY FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD STILL REVOLVES AROUND HOW 
FAR SOUTH/EAST THE FRONT WILL PROGRESS. OPERATIONAL MODELS AND MOST 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SUGGEST FRONT WILL PUSH PAST THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS WHICH IS QUESTIONABLE GIVEN TIME-OF-THE-YEAR 
CLIMATOLOGY. AT ANY RATE...SUSPECT FRONT WILL LINGER CLOSE ENOUGH TO

314 PM EDT SAT JUN 16 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS HAVE TRIED TO GET 
GOING THIS AFTERNOON...BUT CAP TOO STRONG SO FAR.  WILL JUST CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR OUR EASTERN MOUNTAINS WHERE SOMETHING MAY BE 
ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH LATE THIS AFTERNOON.  UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN 
DURING THE SHORT TERM.  WITH RISING HEIGHTS AND DIMINISHING 
MOISTURE...SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT...WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE 
AND A HOT AFTERNOON ON SUNDAY. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO ONLY A FEW MINOR TWEAKS.  


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES ARE NOW IN SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT WITH NEXT SYSTEM. 
STILL APPEARS BEST POPS WILL OCCUR IN THE LATE TUESDAY/EARLY 
WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME AS SURFACE FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH APPROACH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FROM THE WEST. MODELS/ENSEMBLES NOW 
SUGGEST THAT FRONT WILL VIRTUALLY STALL NEAR OR JUST SOUTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS RESULTS IN THE SPECTER OF SCATTERED DIURNAL 
CONVECTION THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. FOR 
TEMPS...TENDED TO USE A BLEND OF GFS AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN GUIDANCE 
WITH TWEAKS BASED ON EXPECTED DEGREE OF CLOUD COVER/CONVECTION.

.DISCUSSION...WEAK IMPULSE APPROACHING AREA FROM THE NORTH THIS 
MORNING. MODELS SHOW WEAK DIVERGENCE ALOFT MAINLY THIS MORNING.
WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ON WESTERN PERIPHERY OF SFC RIDGE
WILL CONTINUE EAST OF THE PLATEAU MOST OF TODAY. LAST BUT NOT LEAST 
ISOLATED SHOWERS PERSISTING ON MRX RADAR SO ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
CWA WIDE.

AREA THIS MORNING. THIS FEATURE IS PROGGED TO MOVE SE INTO THE 
MOUNTAINS BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON. INFLUENCE OF UPPER TROUGHING FROM 
THE NE IS PROGGED TO WEAKEN AS HEIGHTS BUILD IN FROM THE WEST LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON. THIS RESULTS IN DECENT MID LEVEL WARMING AND A 
FORMIDABLE CAP. KEPT AND SLIGHTLY RAISED POPS TODAY OVER SMOKYS AS 
DESTABILIZATION AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT SHOULD SUPPORT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION. WESTERN AND CENTRAL AREAS MAY NEEDED TO BE BUMPED UP 
WITH UPDATE IF OVERALL EASTERN PROGRESSION OF SYNOPTIC FEATURES IS 
TOO FAST. TEMPS ABOUT A DEGREES WARMER THAN FRIDAY WITH TEMPS 
REMAINING AT OR BELOW NORMAL ACROSS NE AREAS. WEAK RIDGING BUILDS IN 
TONIGHT WITH NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER ELEMENTS OF NOTE.

LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...RIDGE IN CONTROL THROUGH THE

TIMING/POSITION OF APPROACHING SYSTEM FOR MID WEEK.  HOWEVER...WILL 
CONTINUE WITH THE IDEA OF MAIN BAND OF PRECIP PUSHING IN ON TUESDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE 
AREA AGAIN TODAY AS EXPECTED...WITH YET ANOTHER WEAK IMPULSE SLIDING 
DOWN FROM THE NORTH.  THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH DURING THE 
EVENING AND THEN END AS LOWER ATMOSPHERE COOLS.  UPPER RIDGE BEGINS 
BUILDING INTO THE AREA SATURDAY.  MAY STILL BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY 
DESPITE MID LEVEL WARMING FOR SOME AFTERNOON CONVECTION EVEN IN 
VALLEY LOCATIONS...BUT FOR NOW WILL GO WITH ONGOING FORECAST AND 
KEEP POPS BELOW 15 IN THE VALLEY AND JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY 
SOME MINOR TWEAKS. 
   

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE LONG TERM IS 
TIMING AND EXTENT OF MID-WEEK SYSTEM. AFTER MAINLY TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS THROUGH EARLY WORK WEEK...GFS CONTINUES TO ADVERTISE 
APPROACH OF UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE COLD FRONT BY LATE TUESDAY/EARLY 
WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...THERE CONTINUES TO BE PROFOUND DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN MEDIUM-RANGE MODELS AND VARIOUS ENSEMBLE SUITES ON THE 
AMPLITUDE AND TIMING OF THIS EVENT. THE GFS SOLUTION OF PUSHING THE 
SURFACE FRONT THROUGH AND WELL SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
SEEMS SOMEWHAT UNLIKELY GIVEN THE TIME OF YEAR...BUT GFS HAS BEEN 
FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH THIS PROGRESSION FOR SEVERAL RUNS. BASED ON 
THIS UNCERTAINTY...AM INCLINED TO NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES FOR 
CONSISTENCY SAKE UNTIL THE EVOLUTION OF THIS EVENT BECOMES MORE 
CLEAR.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...UPPER TROUGH REMAINS ANCHORED OFF 
THE NEW ENGLAND COAST WITH OCCASIONAL DISTURBANCES ROTATING AROUND 
THE WESTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS FEATURE. THESE DISTURBANCES TEND TO 
ENHANCE DIURNAL CONVECTION. THE COINCIDENCE OF ANY OF THESE 
DISTURBANCES WITH PEAK HEATING WILL DETERMINE COVERAGE AND INTENSITY 
OF DIURNAL CONVECTION. FOR FRIDAY...HAVE OPTED TO GO SLIGHTLY ABOVE  
GFS GUIDANCE FOR POPS ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN GIVEN THE 
PROXIMITY OF THE UPPER TROUGH. HOWEVER AS NOTED SECONDARY 
DISTURBANCES AROUND THE UPPER LOW WILL HAVE THE GREATEST INFLUENCE 
ON COVERAGE. FOR TEMPS...HAVE NO REASON TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE 
FROM GFS GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...DRY CONDITIONS RETURN BY 
THE WEEKEND AS UPPER LOW OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST OPENS UP AND IS 
ACCELERATES EASTWARD...ALLOWING UPPER RIDGE TO BUILD INTO THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A CLOSED LOW OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY 
THROUGH TONIGHT. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH NOW OVER NEW ENGLAND WILL MOVE 
SOUTH AND CROSS OUR AREA THIS EVENING...BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WHILE SURFACE HEATING WILL GENERATE SOME 
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED STORMS IN OUR AREA THIS AFTERNOON...EXPECT 
THAT MORE ORGANIZED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP ALONG A 
SURFACE TROUGH AND RESIDUAL OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES LOCATED ACROSS 
EASTERN KY AND SOUTHERN WV. MODELS SHOW THE GREATEST INSTABILITY IN 
THIS AREA. THE STORMS WILL MOVE TO THE SOUTH...AFFECTING SW VA AND 
NE TN IN THE EVENING. THUS WILL HAVE HIGHEST POPS FROM AROUND 22Z TO 
MIDNIGHT IN THE NORTH. STEEP LAPSE RATES AND MLCAPE OVER 1000 J/KG 
IN THE NORTH WILL PROVIDE A THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS. MOS POPS HAVE 
BEEN TOO LOW THE PAST FEW DAYS...AND WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS 
NORTHEAST. MOS TEMPS HAVE ALSO BEEN TOO COOL...SO WILL HAVE HIGHS 
TODAY A FEW DEGREES ABOVE MOS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
USED A SOLUTION SIMILAR TO THE 00Z GFS MODEL FOR THE EXTENDED
WHICH FEATURES AN UPPER TROF/CLOSED LOW WHICH IS STILL HANGING
AROUND OVER THE ATLANTIC COAST THROUGH SATURDAY. THIS MEANS DECENT
INSTABILITY AND LIFT STILL IN STORE FOR FRIDAY AS VORT MAXIMA STILL
PLENTIFUL ON THE BACK SIDE OF UPPER TROF. THEREFORE CHANCE POPS
WARRANTED THROUGH EVENING HOURS FRIDAY TAPERING OFF AFTER MIDNIGHT.
UPPER TROF WEAKENS AND GRADUALLY SHIFTS EAST ON SATURDAY AS
ADVERTISED RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA. HOTTEST DAY
FORECAST TO OCCUR ON SUNDAY AS RIDGE AXIS MOVES ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND APPALACHIANS. KEPT CONVECTION OUT OF THE
FORECAST ON MONDAY AWAITING BETTER INFLUX OF HIGHER DEWPOINT AIR
WHICH RETURNS ON SOUTHERLY WINDS TUESDAY AHEAD OF MIDWEST UPPER
TROF AND ASSOCIATED FRONT. WENT WITH HIGHEST CHANCE POPS FOR
WEDNESDAY AS BELIEVE SURFACE COOL FRONT WILL MOVE A LITTLE SLOWER
THAN MODEL SOLUTION. STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR THE

HAVE BEEN NEAR SEVERE LIMITS, WITH AN ISOLATED SEVERE ONE. EXPECT 
STORMS/SHOWERS TO WEAKEN AFTER SUNSET, EVENTUALLY DYING OUT IN THE

VALLEY WHERE RAIN HAS FALLEN AND SIGNIFICANT POST-OUTFLOW COOLING 
HAS OCCURRED, SOME PATCHY FOG WILL FORM WHICH WILL DISSIPATE AFTER 
SUNRISE. WILL ISSUE UPDATE TO ZONES TO RAISE POPS IN CENTRAL VALLEY 
AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE STORMS HAVE NOT OCCURRED YET, AND

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LOW OFF THE

303 AM EDT WED JUN 13 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
SOME RESIDUAL SHOWERS FROM A DECAYING MCS ARE MOVING SOUTHWEST ALONG 
THE APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING. MOST OF THE PRECIP SHOULD DISSIPATE 
BY THE TIME IT REACHES OUR AREA...BUT WILL LEAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
IN THIS MORNING. TEMPS WILL BE TRICKY TODAY AND DEPEND ON HOW MUCH 
MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS HOLD TOGETHER. BETTER PRECIP CHANCES COME 
THIS AFTERNOON WITH SURFACE HEATING AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE. LAPSE 
RATES ARE NOT AS STEEP AS YESTERDAY AS THE UPPER LOW HAS MOVED 
AWAY...AND MOISTURE REMAINS LIMITED BUT DOES INCREASE THROUGH THE 
DAY. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS NORTHEAST AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. ON 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES 
ACROSS...SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...COOLING THE MIDLEVELS AND PROVIDING 
UPPER DIVERGENCE. WILL HAVE CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE AREA. AN UPPER TROUGH AXIS FROM THE CLOSED LOW OFF THE NEW 
ENGLAND COAST CONTINUES TO EXTEND OVER THE AREA INTO FRIDAY...WHICH 
WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...WITH HIGHEST 
CHANCES EAST. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
UPPER LOW FINALLY MAKES ENOUGH PROGRESS EAST AWAY FROM THE
FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY TO ALLOW FOR HIGHER PRESSURE OVER THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. IN THIS REGIME THE DRIER AND
MORE STABLE ATMOSPHERE WILL LEAD TO A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE AND
BUILDING HEAT THROUGH MONDAY WITH VERY LIMITED PROBABILITY OF
PRECIPITATION. RIDGE SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST BY TUESDAY AND INCREASING
SOUTHERLY COMPONENT AT ALL LEVELS LEADS TO MOISTURE ADVECTION AHEAD
OF THE NEXT UPPER TROF WHICH MIGRATES INTO THE NORTHERN CENTRAL
STATES AT THIS TIME. INCREASING INSTABILITY PROVIDES FOR POSSIBLE
CONVECTION ON TUESDAY AND MAINTAINED CHANCE POP FROM PREVIOUS
FORECAST. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO MEX MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH
LONG TERM.

.DISCUSSION...OUTER FRINGE OF COLD CORE MID LEVEL CIRCULATION SLIDING
SW ALONG PAST SE CORNER OF MRX CWA. THIS FEATURE COUPLED WITH AFTN 
HEATING RESULTED IN WIDESPREAD STRONG TO SEVERE CONVECTION...MAINLY
ACROSS THE CAROLINAS. DEEPEST MOISTURE REMAINS EAST OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT
BUT INCREASES WEDNESDAY ACROSS THE AREA AS MOISTURE PUSHES IN FROM 
THE NE. WILL CANCEL SVA.0388 FOR CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES AND DROP 
POPS ACROSS THE MRX CWA. ISOLATED CONVECTION REMAINS POSSIBLE BUT 
COVERAGE SHOULD REMAIN BELOW 20 PERCENT. CONVECTIVE AREA MOVING SW 
INTO N VA SHOULD REMAIN NE OF AREA OVERNIGHT. ALSO DUE TO DRY 
BOUNDARY LAYER HAVE TWEAKED MINS DOWN A COUPLE DEGREES. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING 
OVER NORTHEAST ZONES...WHERE AIR MASS HAS DESTABILIZED AND A SHORT 
WAVE IS MOVING THROUGH.  HOWEVER...MOISTURE IS LIMITED AND MAIN AREA 
OF LIFT WILL TRACK TO OUR EAST.  AS A RESULT...COVERAGE SHOULD 
REMAIN LOW THOUGH THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR STAY STORMS TO BRIEFLY 
BECOME QUITE STRONG...POSSIBLY EVEN SEVERE.  CAN NOT COMPLETELY RULE 
OUT A STRAY STORM SLIDING INTO THE TN VALLEY...BUT CHANGES ARE LOW 
ENOUGH WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR NOW.  ANY STORMS OVER THE AREA 
SHOULD DIMINISH QUICKLY WITH SUNSET.  ON WEDNESDAY...WILL SEE 
CONDITIONS SIMILAR TO TODAY...WITH AFTERNOON INSTABILITY...MAINLY 
OVER ELEVATED AREAS...AND ANOTHER SHORT WAVE ROTATING THROUGH THE 
REGION.  HOWEVER ...WILL HAVE POPS SLIGHTLY HIGHER AS SHORT WAVE 
EXPECTED TO TRACK A LITTLE FURTHER INTO THE MRX CWA. 

LONG TERM  (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER LOW OFF 
NORTHEAST COAST SPINS AWAY ACCORDING TO MODELS AND DROPS WEAK SPOKES 
OF VORTICITY AND INSTABILITY WEDNESDAY, THURSDAY, AND FRIDAY SO HAVE 
SLIGHTLY INCREASED POPS IN THOSE TIME PERIODS MAINLY OVER EASTERN 
PORTIONS OF FORECAST AREA, IN MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
NORTHEAST. THE LOW FINALLY OPENS UP AND IS ABSORBED BY HUDSON BAY 
TROUGH. CENTRAL NOAM RIDGE MOVES EAST ACROSS EASTER U.S. BY LATER 
FRIDAY, SO THE WEEKEND LOOKS DRY. UPPER RIDGE MOVES EAST TO COAST BY 
MONDAY-TUESDAY TIME FRAME WITH LOOK AT NEXT TROUGH DROPPING OUT OF 
CANADA INTO MIDWEST LATER TUESDAY. INCREASE OF MOISTURE FROM SOUTH 
ON TUESDAY SO WENT WITH CHANCE POPS MOVING NORTH ACROSS THE AREA 
THEN. LEFT TEMPS LARGELY UNCHANGED FROM PREVIOUS PACKAGE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO
NEW ENGLAND THROUGH THE PERIOD. ALOFT...A CLOSED LOW WILL REMAIN
NEARLY STATIONARY OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST...AND A SERIES OF
SHORTWAVE TROUGHS WILL ROTATE AROUND THIS LOW. THE FIRST WILL PASS
THROUGH TODAY...MAINLY AFFECTING THE NORTHEAST PORTIONS OF OUR
AREA. THOUGH MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED...COOL MIDLEVEL TEMPS WILL
RESULT IN STEEP LAPSE RATES AND SBCAPE NEAR 1000 J/KG NORTHEAST AND
IN THE MOUNTAINS. WILL INCLUDE CHANCE POPS IN THOSE AREAS...WHICH
IS WELL ABOVE MOS. THE VALLEY AND PLATEAU WILL BE MORE STABLE AND
SHOULD STAY DRY. MODELS SHOW SOME INCREASING MOISTURE ON WEDNESDAY
BUT NOT MUCH INSTABILITY OR LIFT...SO WILL JUST HAVE A SLIGHT
CHANCE POP NORTHEAST. A SECOND SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE AREA
THURSDAY EVENING/NIGHT...AGAIN GIVING STEEP LAPSE RATES IN THE
NORTHEAST. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS WITH THIS FEATURE. TEMPERATURES
SHOULD GENERALLY BE NEAR NORMAL FOR THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS CONTINUE TO DEPICT VORT MOVING SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS ON THE BACK SIDE OF SLOWLY DEPARTING EASTERN SEABOARD
UPPER TROF FOR FRIDAY. STAYED WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION
GENERALLY EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WHILE DROPPING WESTERN
PORTION INTO THE SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY. BY SATURDAY MODELS SHOW
UPPER RIDGING STRENGTHENING OVER SOUTHEASTERN U.S. AS UPPER TROF
EDGES JUST OFF ATLANTIC COAST BY 00Z SUNDAY. USED A SLIGHT CHANCE
POP FOR POSSIBLE CONVECTION EASTERN ZONES WHERE DEEPER
MOISTURE/BETTER INSTABILITY PROGGED. STAYED ON THE DRY SIDE FOR THE
WEEKEND THROUGH MONDAY AS UPPER RIDGE ESTABLISHES ITSELF ACROSS THE
EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION. TWEAKED MIN/MAX TEMPS TOWARD NEW MEX
MOS GUIDANCE WHICH INCLUDES A WARMING TREND COMPLIMENTS OF
SUBSIDENCE AND INCREASING INSOLATION.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH TO OUR 
EAST COULD CARRY OVER A FEW SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE MRX 
CWA...MAINLY OVER EASTERN MOUNTAINS THIS EVENING.  OTHERWISE...MID 
TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY SHIFT SOUTHWARD...
WITH SKIES BECOMING CLEAR BY MORNING.  ON TUESDAY...EXPECT OUR AIR 
MASS TO BECOME SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE WITH LESS CLOUD COVER FOR STRONGER 
DIURNAL HEATING.  AS ANOTHER WAVE MOVES THROUGH TO OUR EAST...MAY 
SEE ISOLATED CONVECTION WITH BEST CHANCES OVER ELEVATED TERRAIN.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER LOW OVER ATLANTIC 
PRODUCING A SERIES OF TROFS OVER MID-ATLANTIC STATES WHICH WILL 
ROTATE OVER REGION THROUGH WEEK. WEAK BACK DOOR FRONTS CROSS AREA. 
NOT STRONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE MUCH WIDESPREAD INSTABILITY AND, HENCE, 
DROUGHT BUSTING RAINS, BUT STILL ENOUGH TO ALLOW TERRAIN ENHANCED 
THUNDERSTORMS AND SHOWERS, MAINLY OVER NORTHEAST SECTIONS AND IN 
MOUNTAINS. BELIEVE AS INSTABILITY INCREASES SOMEWHAT (CAPES UP 
AROUND 2000) BY MIDWEEK, MIGHT SEEM ISOLATED BORDERLINE SEVERE 
STORMS AS HAS BEEN THE CASE WITH SIMILAR STORMS RECENTLY. AS UPPER 
LOW FINALLY DRIFTS EAST, UPPER RIDGE TO WEST ASSERTS ITSELF FROM

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS 
LOCATED OVER SOUTHERN GA AND THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE THIS 
MORNING...WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH AXIS EXTENDING NORTH TOWARD THE 
APPALACHIANS. A SOUTHEAST FLOW WILL ADVECT MOISTURE FROM THE 
ATLANTIC TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY. SOME WEAK LOW LEVEL 
LIFT ENHANCED BY UPSLOPE FLOW SHOULD PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS...AND ESPECIALLY SW NC. THERE WILL 
ALSO BE SOME INSTABILITY IN THE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON WITH LI AROUND 
-3...SO WILL INCLUDE A LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP OUTSIDE THE 
MOUNTAINS. SOME BROKEN MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS SHOULD HOLD TEMPS 
BACK A BIT FROM PREVIOUS DAYS...WITH HIGHS IN THE 80S IN MOST SPOTS. 
WILL KEEP LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR THE EVENING HOURS...BUT 
WITH THE LOSS OF SURFACE HEATING AND HIGH PRESSURE TO THE NORTH 
BUILDING SOUTHWARD...ANY PRECIP SHOULD BE OUT OF THE AREA AROUND 
MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE TROUGH PUSHING INTO 
REGION ON TUESDAY...MOISTURE LIMITED...BUT SOME INSTABILITY COULD 
BRING SOME DIURNAL ACTIVITY ON TUESDAY...WILL GO WITH 20-30 POPS FOR 
TUESDAY...WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE MOUNTAINS.  MODELS BRING 
AN UPPER LOW TRACKING INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY.  BEST MOISTURE 
REMAINING TO THE EAST OF OUR CWA...BUT STILL DECENT INSTABILITY 
EXPECTED.  WILL KEEP 20 POPS FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...CORRECTED FORECASTER INITIALS
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
230 PM EDT SUN JUN 10 2007

.SHORT TERM  (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES...AND 
EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL 
THAT A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE OZARKS 
REGION NEAR A STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE 700-500 MB ISOHEIGHT 
PATTERN WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS MCS WILL MOVE SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON 
(WHERE THE BEST INSTABILITY ALSO RESIDES) AND STAY WEST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT ANOTHER MCS WILL 
DEVELOP OVER CENTRAL MISSOURI LATER TONIGHT...AS THE NOCTURNAL 
LOW-LEVEL JET STRENGTHENS OVER THE PLAINS. THE 700-500 MB ISOHEIGHT 
PATTERN WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS MCS WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST TOWARDS 
SOUTHEAST TN BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. FOR SOME REASON...THE GFS MODEL 
WEAKENS THIS MCS QUICKLY BY AFTERNOON...EVEN THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE 
SOME MARGINAL TO POSSIBLY MODERATE INSTABILITY IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM AS IT NEARS THE CHATTANOOGA AREA. FEEL THAT THE GFS SOLUTION 
IS UNREALISTIC (MODELS USUALLY CANT HANDLE MCSS VERY WELL ANYWAY) 
AND THINK THAT AN MCS MAY AFFECT SOUTHEAST TN BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. 
WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL INTRODUCE CHANCE POPS ON MONDAY AFTERNOON 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC. IN ADDITION...EASTERLY FLOW 
OVER THE CAROLINAS AND A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC WILL INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS...PRODUCING 
SOME CONVECTION ON MONDAY OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND POSSIBLY OVER THE 
VALLEYS. IN ADDITION...WILL INCLUDE POPS ON TUESDAY AS MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY CONTINUE TO INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARD A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER MAXES DUE TO AN EXPECTED 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH TO OUR EAST 
WILL ROTATE THROUGH A COUPLE OF WEAK WAVES ON WEDNESDAY PROVIDING A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIMITED CONVECTION MAINLY OVER OUR EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS. ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVES MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER TROUGH

230 PM EDT SUN JUN 10 2007

.SHORT TERM  (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES...AND 
EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL 
THAT A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM HAS DEVELOPED OVER THE OZARKS 
REGION NEAR A STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE 700-500 MB ISOHEIGHT 
PATTERN WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS MCS WILL MOVE SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON 
(WHERE THE BEST INSTABILITY ALSO RESIDES) AND STAY WEST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT. GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT ANOTHER MCS WILL 
DEVELOP OVER CENTRAL MISSOURI LATER TONIGHT...AS THE NOCTURNAL 
LOW-LEVEL JET STRENGTHENS OVER THE PLAINS. THE 700-500 MB ISOHEIGHT 
PATTERN WOULD SUGGEST THAT THIS MCS WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST TOWARDS 
SOUTHEAST TN BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. FOR SOME REASON...THE GFS MODEL 
WEAKENS THIS MCS QUICKLY BY AFTERNOON...EVEN THOUGH THERE SHOULD BE 
SOME MARGINAL TO POSSIBLY MODERATE INSTABILITY IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE 
SYSTEM AS IT NEARS THE CHATTANOOGA AREA. FEEL THAT THE GFS SOLUTION 
IS UNREALISTIC (MODELS USUALLY CANT HANDLE MCSS VERY WELL ANYWAY) 
AND THINK THAT AN MCS MAY AFFECT SOUTHEAST TN BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. 
WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL INTRODUCE CHANCE POPS ON MONDAY AFTERNOON 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC. IN ADDITION...EASTERLY FLOW 
OVER THE CAROLINAS AND A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC WILL INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS...PRODUCING 
SOME CONVECTION ON MONDAY OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND POSSIBLY OVER THE 
VALLEYS. IN ADDITION...WILL INCLUDE POPS ON TUESDAY AS MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY CONTINUE TO INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARD A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER MAXES DUE TO AN EXPECTED 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH TO OUR EAST 
WILL ROTATE THROUGH A COUPLE OF WEAK WAVES ON WEDNESDAY PROVIDING A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIMITED CONVECTION MAINLY OVER OUR EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS.  ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVES MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER TROUGH 
WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK THROUGH THE REGION.  THE RESULT WILL BE AN 
UNORGANIZED COUPLE OF ROUNDS OF ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS FOR THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.  MODELS HINTING

ANALYSIS SHOWS THAT THE COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA...WITH DEWPOINTS DROPPING INTO THE LOW TO MID 60S AND LIGHT 
NORTHWEST WINDS. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL THAT CLOUDS HAVE GRADUALLY 
DIMINISHED AS DRIER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND THE FRONT. NORTHWESTERLY 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO BRING DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM NEAR INDIANAPOLIS 
SOUTHWEST TO NEAR LITTLE ROCK...WITH A VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
DEVELOPING OVER THE PLATEAU BETWEEN THE FIRST AND SECOND LINES OF 
CONVECTION. THE INITIAL LINE OF CONVECTION OVER THE GREAT TN VALLEY 
HAS REMAINED BELOW SEVERE CRITERIA SO FAR...BUT THINK THAT THE 
SECOND LINE OF CONVECTION (CURRENTLY OVER MIDDLE TN) WILL LIKELY 
PRODUCE SOME SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY 
TONIGHT AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL. IN FACT...THIS FRONT 
SHOULD BISECT THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...WITH ISOLATED 
CONVECTION AGAIN POSSIBLE ON SATURDAY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST NC. THE FRONT SHOULD EVENTUALLY PUSH SOUTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA BY SUNDAY MORNING...WITH DRY WEATHER RETURNING ON SUNDAY. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARD A PERSISTENCE FORECAST TONIGHT AND 
SATURDAY...WITH LOWER TEMPS EXPECTED BY SATURDAY NIGHT AS SLIGHTLY 
DRIER AIR MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE MAIN WEATHER FEATURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE. THIS WILL KEEP MOST AREAS 
DRY AND WARM...THOUGH MAY SEE SOME ELEVATED CONVECTION LATE 
AFTERNOON BOTH DAYS. COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE REGION DURING THE 
REMAINDER OF THE TIME FRAME. SYSTEM APPEARS TO BE A BIT UNORGANIZED

REVEAL SOME CONVECTION OCCURRING AHEAD OF THE FRONT ACROSS THE LOWER

VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS (CAPES AROUND 3500 J/KG AND LIS AROUND -6) 
WILL DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A CLASSIC INVERTED-V 
PROFILE IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER. IN ADDITION...A DEEP MID-LEVEL LAYER 
OF DRY AIR AND STEEP LOW-LEVEL LAPSE RATES SHOULD ALL COMBINE TO 
PRODUCE STRONG DOWNBURST WINDS WITH THIS AFTERNOONS CONVECTION. 
LARGE HAIL WILL ALSO BE A CONCERN DUE TO THE VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS

SUPPRESSED TO THE SOUTH AS A TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND 
OHIO VALLEY TODAY. ADVECTION OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE

GENEROUS INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS INDICATE MLCAPE VALUES 
APPROACHING 3000 J/KG ACROSS THE AREA AROUND 18Z...WITH LI AROUND 
-5. MIDLEVEL DRY AIR...HIGH DOWNDRAFT CAPE...AND STEEP LOW LEVEL 
LAPSE RATES SUGGEST THE MAIN SEVERE THREAT WILL BE DAMAGING 
DOWNBURST WINDS...THOUGH WITH THE HIGH CAPE LARGE HAIL WILL ALSO BE 
POSSIBLE. WOULD PREFER TO SEE STRONGER UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS TO AID 
LIFT FOR A BETTER THREAT OF SEVERE...THE UPPER JET AND TROUGH STAY 
WELL NORTH...BUT GIVEN THE INSTABILITY THAT WILL BE IN PLACE...ONLY 
WEAK BOUNDARIES WILL BE NEEDED FOR CONVECTIVE INITIATION. THE SEVERE 
THREAT SHOULD DIMINISH AFTER 00Z AS THE FLOW TURNS NORTHWESTERLY

.DISCUSSION...EVEN WITH TEMPERATURES UP AT THE 9 PM 
OBSERVATION...GOOD DEW POINT DEPRESSIONS WILL ALLOW FOR RAPID 
COOLING OVER THEN NEXT FEW HOURS AND CURRENT LOW TEMPERATURES APPEAR 
REASONABLE.  GOOD MOISTURE RETURN WILL SEE CLOUDINESS INCREASING 
LATER TONIGHT WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING.  MOST OF EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IS UNDER A 
SLIGHT RISK THREAT FOR TOMORROW.  SEE MEMHWOMRX FOR DETAILS. 


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT 
SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST KY AND NORTHEAST TN...WITH DEWPOINTS BEGINNING TO 
SLOWLY RISE AT TRI-CITIES. SURFACE MOISTURE LEVELS SHOULD SLOWLY 
INCREASE TONIGHT...AS SOUTHERLY 850 MB FLOW CONTINUES AHEAD OF AN 
UNSEASONABLY STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER 
VALLEY. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION 
WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPRESS CONVECTION THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...BUT 
THEN WEAKEN BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE EARLY EVENING HOURS...WITH 
SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT BY LATE FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON. ALTHOUGH WIND FIELDS AND UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS ARE PROGGED 
TO BE WEAK WITH THIS FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY...A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST KY AND NORTHEAST TN...WITH DEWPOINTS BEGINNING TO SLOWLY 
RISE AT TRI-CITIES. SURFACE MOISTURE LEVELS SHOULD SLOWLY INCREASE 
TONIGHT...AS SOUTHERLY 850 MB FLOW CONTINUES AHEAD OF AN 
UNSEASONABLY STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER 
VALLEY. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT A STRONG CAPPING INVERSION 
WILL CONTINUE TO SUPPRESS CONVECTION THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING...BUT 
THEN WEAKEN BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE EARLY EVENING HOURS...WITH 
SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT BY LATE FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON. ALTHOUGH WIND FIELDS AND UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS ARE PROGGED 
TO BE WEAK WITH THIS FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY...A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO 
THINK THAT SOME SEVERE TSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. WITH THE UPPER-

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO SHOW A WEAK WARM FRONT BETWEEN 
KNOXVILLE AND TRI-CITIES...WITH DEWPOINTS GRADUALLY RISING BEHIND 
THE FRONT ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN. THIS WARM FRONT IS EXPECTED TO SLOWLY 
MOVE NORTH INTO THE MID ATLANTIC REGION TODAY...AS SOUTHERLY WINDS 
DEVELOP AHEAD OF AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS. MODEL SOUNDINGS AND MORNING BNA SOUNDING CONTINUE 
TO REVEAL A STRONG MID-LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION...WHICH SHOULD SUPPRESS 
ANY POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

CURRENT FORECAST OF MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
WILL UPDATE THIS MORNING TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE

329 AM EDT THU JUN 7 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...BENIGN WEATHER EXPECTED TO 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM IN SPITE OF SLOW INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE...ESPECIALLY IN THE SOUTHERN TIER...PER MODEL AND SREF 
CONSENSUS. HOWEVER...INSTABILITY STILL UNIMPRESSIVE AND MENTION OF 
ANY POPS WAS LEFT OUT. WINDS EXPECTED TO INCREASE SOMEWHAT AS 
GRADIENT BETWEEN DEPARTING SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD AND APPROACHING TROUGH FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS INCREASES. 
FOR TEMPS...HAD NO REASON TO DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM GFS GUIDANCE 
AS IT APPEARS REASONABLE GIVEN THE EXPECTED SCENARIO.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...STILL APPEARS THAT THE
BEST CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION (PCPN) WILL BE FRIDAY NIGHT...AHEAD OF
THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. MODELS DIFFER A BIT ON TIMING...SO KEPT
JUST IN HIGHER CHANCE RANGE FOR NOW. ATMOSPHERE BECOMES MODERATELY
UNSTABLE AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS
QUITE POSSIBLE...ALTHOUGH WIND FIELDS LOOK MORE SUPPORTIVE OF
SEVERE STORMS TO OUR NORTH OVER PARTS OF THE OHIO VALLEY. 

ON SATURDAY THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY BECOMES MORE EAST TO WEST ORIENTED
...WITH SEVERAL MODELS STILL INDICATING SOME DRYING FROM THE NORTH
RATHER EARLY SATURDAY (EXCEPT FOR NAM-WRF WHICH HANGS TO MOISTURE A
BIT LONGER). 07/00Z MOS GUIDANCE OFFERS VERY LOW SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
ACROSS THE BOARD (EVEN NAM MOS) ON SATURDAY...SO ADJUSTED GRIDS TO
REFLECT THIS DRYING FROM THE NORTH. NEIGHBORING NWS OFFICES TO OUR
NORTH AND EAST ALSO MADE THESE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS...TRENDING TO A
DRY FORECAST FOR MOST OF SATURDAY.

ANY CONVECTIVE PCPN FOR MONDAY LOOKS ISOLATED AT THIS POINT...WITH 
CHANCES INCREASING BY TUESDAY...AS GENERALLY ADVERTISED ALREADY IN
OUR FORECAST GRIDS. OTHERWISE...KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
WEDNESDAY (ALTHO GFS IS TRENDING WETTER INTO THURSDAY NOW). SOME
PRELIMINARY GRIDS MADE FOR NEW DAY 7...WITH CHANCE POPS AND NEAR
CLIMO TEMPS. MAX/MIN TEMPS FOR OTHER DAYS WERE ADJUSTED IN LINE
WITH THE LATEST GFS/GFSX MOS GUIDANCE.

SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT ACROSS THE

CHATTANOOGA AND KNOXVILLE. THIS WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE 
NORTH TONIGHT WITH MOISTURE LEVELS INCREASING...AS SOUTHERLY FLOW 
CONTINUES ACROSS THE REGION AHEAD OF A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT A CAPPING 
INVERSION AROUND 700 MB WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...WHICH 
SHOULD SUPPRESS ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. IN ADDITION...AN UPPER

WEATHER LATE IN THE DAY. COOL FRONT DROPS INTO THE DEEP SOUTH ON 
SUNDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS SOUTH THROUGH THE CENTRAL

WEEKEND. LOW LEVEL FLOW EVENTUALLY GOES SOUTHERLY AS SURFACE RIDGING 
PRESSES FARTHER EAST OVER THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD AND ANOTHER UPPER

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRY WEATHER RETURNS AS UPPER 
TROUGH DEPARTS AND UPPER RIDGE BUILDS BACK INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN 
CONUS. MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT DRYING AT ALL LEVELS ALONG WITH 
STRONG SUBSIDENCE AS THIS PROCESS UNFOLDS. FOR TEMPS...INCLINED TO 
GO ON THE HIGH SIDE OF GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST PERIOD GIVEN THE 
EXPECTED ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND RISING HEIGHTS AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS 
IN.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS CONSISTENT WITH
THURSDAY BEING DRY AND SLIGHTLY WARMER AS UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO
BUILD ACROSS THE REGION. HOWEVER...SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD HAVE
ALREADY SHIFTED EAST TO ALONG OR OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST...WHICH
ALLOWS A FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE RETURN BY FRIDAY DAYTIME. POPS ON
FRIDAY MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED...ESPECIALLY FOR THE LATE AFTERNOON
AND EVENING AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. PROBABLY THE BEST
INSTABILITY THAT WE HAVE SEEN OF LATE FOR FRIDAY PM HOURS WITH
CAPE REACHING 1500 TO 2000 J/KG. FOR NOW...I INCREASED SKY COVER TO
BE MORE CONSISTENT (AND MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS) FOR FRIDAY
NIGHT...BUT KEPT POPS IN THE CHANCE CATGEGORY.

FRONT LOOKS TO STRETCH EAST TO WEST BY 12Z SATURDAY...WITH 00Z GFS
DGEX AND ECMWF ALL SHOWING SOME DRYING FOR NRN PARTS OF THE
FORECAST AREA BEHIND THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
IN ALL AREAS FOR NOW THROUGH SATURDAY AFTERNOON...BUT WE MAY BE
ABLE TO REMOVE POPS FOR SW VA AND NE TN IN THE NEXT FORECAST
PACKAGE OR SO. RIDGE ALOFT AND SURFACE SHOULD PROVIDE DRY AND WARM
CONDITIONS FOR SUNDAY...AS PREVIOUSLY ADVERTISED.

TIMING ANY FOCUS FOR CONVECTION ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY SEEMS
UNCERTAIN AT THIS POINT...SO NO CHANGES MADE FOR THOSE PERIODS.
DID ADJUST MAX AND MIN TEMPS JUST A BIT IN LINE WITH 06/00Z GFS MOS
GUIDANCE. ALSO...ADDED SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS FOR NEW DAY 7
(WEDNESDAY) WHICH WOULD APPEAR TO BE ANOTHER DRY DAY WITH RIDGING
DOMINATING.

950 AM EDT TUE JUN 5 2007

.DISCUSSION...CURRENT FORECAST ON TRACK.  WILL UPDATE ZONES TO 
REMOVE MORNING SHOWER CHANCES FOR THE MOUNTAINS.  NO OTHER CHANGES 
PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SPOTTY SHOWERS HAVE 
MOVED EAST OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...LEAVING SOME 
CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS. THE WEAK FRONT APPEARS TO HAVE NOT PUSHED 
EAST ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS MORNING (NO CHANGE IN DEW 
POINT TEMPS FROM PLATEAU EASTWARD)...BUT VAD WIND PROFILES DO SHOW 
DEEP WESTERLY WINDS ABOVE THE SURFACE ON THE ORDER OF 20 TO 30 
KNOTS...WHICH SHOULD PROVIDE SUFFICIENT MIXING TO INHIBIT ANY AREAS 
OF SIGNIFICANT FOG THIS MORNING. REMOVED ANY MENTION OF SHOWERS FROM 
THE EARLY TO MID MORNING FORECAST GRIDS.

THE CYCLONIC UPPER LEVEL FLOW AND DAYTIME HEATING JUSTIFY LOW 20-30
PERCENT POPS FOR MAINLY THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING HOURS...AND 
PERHAPS THE LINGERING WEAK FRONT/TROUGH MIGHT AID DEVELOPMENT. I 
WENT ALONG WITH THE NAM-WRFS DEPICTION OF A SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE 
DROPPING ESE THIS EVENING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY REGION...WHICH 
SUPPORTS CONVECTION CONTINUING TO OUR NORTH AND POSSIBLY AFFECTING 
SW VA AREAS BEYOND MIDNIGHT. THIS STILL JUST WARRANTS LOW CHANCE 
POPS GIVEN DIMINISHING INSTABILITY WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME HEAT. 
THINKING IS THAT ALL CONVECTION SHOULD HAVE DISSIPATED OR MOVED WELL 
EAST OF OUR FORECAST AREA BEFORE 12Z WEDNESDAY.

OTHERWISE...I DONT AGREE WITH MOS GUIDANCE THAT MAX TEMPS WILL COOL 
BY A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES TODAY...GIVEN A FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE 
AND WESTERLY WINDS. THUS...I WENT 2 TO 3 DEGREES ABOVE THE GFS MOS 
HIGHS...WHICH WAS ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF ERROR GFS MOS HAD FOR MONDAY 
MAX TEMPS. GFS MOS MINS TONIGHT SEEMED REASONABLE...BUT WERE A 
LITTLE ABOVE PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID.

RIDGE AGAIN BUILDS OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. UPPER RIDGE FLATTENS 
SOMEWHAT BY LATE FRIDAY ALLOWING A WEAK FRONT TO APPROACH PER MEDIUM

WEEKEND PERMITTING WIDELY SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION TO 
DEVELOP...MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. UPPER RIDGE REMAINS 
SOMEWHAT SUPPRESSED TO THE SOUTH EARLY NEXT WEEK PUTTING 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE.

CONVECTION AND HAVE GONE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY PM BEFORE 
TAPERING OFF BY TUESDAY MORNING. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY WENT WITH GFS 
GUIDANCE WHICH KEEPS TEMPS ABOVE CLIMO THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MODELS BRING A SHORTWAVE INTO 
THE AREA THIS EVENING.  RADAR ALREADY INDICATING A FEW SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING IN MIDDLE TN AND KY AHEAD OF IT.  NOT MUCH 
MOISTURE AVAILABLE...SO WILL GO WITH ONLY 20 TO 40 POPS FOR TONIGHT 
WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH WHERE THE BEST MOISTURE RESIDES.  
ANOTHER DISTURBANCE TRACKS IN LATE TUESDAY.  BETTER CHANCES SHOULD 
HOLD OFF UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP 20 TO 30 POPS FOR THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS WITH SOME DIURNAL ACTIVITY POSSIBLE.  BEST CHANCES  
IN THE NORTH AGAIN WHERE THE BEST MOISTURE LINGERS.  STAYED NEAR MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINTS.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...GFS AND WRF SHOW ANOTHER
SHORT-WAVE ROTATING AROUND NORTHEAST UPPER LOW FOR TUESDAY NIGHT SO HAVE
KEPT A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE NORTHERN 
TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...UPPER RIDGE STRENGTHENS OVER THE FORECAST
AREA WITH INCREASING THICKNESS AND MID-LEVEL CAP. END RESULT WILL BE 
MOSTLY DRY AND HOT CONDITIONS FOR MID-WEEK. SURFACE HIGH MOVES EAST 
OF THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT WITH INCREASING BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE 
FOR FRIDAY. HAVE INCLUDED A SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE OF DIURNAL 
CONVECTION FOR FRIDAY FOR MAINLY THE HIGHER TERRAIN DUE TO 
INCREASING MOISTURE.

FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN 
CANADA WILL HELP DRAG A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND BECOME 
NEARLY STATIONARY OVER KENTUCKY OR NEAR THE KENTUCY-TENNESSEE STATE-
LINE. GFS SHOWS PLENTY OF BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE RETURNING FOR NEXT 
WEEKEND (EVEN THOUGH DEWPOINTS SEEM A LITTLE TOO HIGH) AND WITH 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY CLOSE TO FORECAST AREA...HAVE INCLUDED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE-CHANCE OF MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION. BEST CHANCE WILL BE 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA DUE TO CLOSER 
PROXIMITY TO THE FRONT.

.DISCUSSION...FOG HAS DISSIPATED...WILL UPDATE ZONES TO REMOVE FROM 
THE MORNING PERIOD.  OTHERWISE...FORECAST ON TRACK...NO OTHER 
CHANGES NEEDED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK IMPULSE MOVING 
ACROSS AL AND MID/E TN EARLY THIS MORNING...WITH A FEW SHOWERS 
REDEVELOPING OVER CENTRAL PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. THESE SHOWERS 
MOVED EAST AND PASSED NEAR OQT AND TYS...BUT ABOUT TO DISSIPATE AT 
FORECAST ISSUANCE. SKIES HAD PARTIALLY CLEARED UNTIL THIS NEW 
CONVECTION DEVELOPED...WITH SOME LOCALLY DENSE FOG NOTED IN THE 
CENTRAL VALLEY (QUITE DENSE FROM MORRISTOWN TO JEFFERSON CITY AND 
DOWN TO NRN PARTS OF SEVIER COUNTY). ADDED AREAS OF PATCHY DENSE FOG 
TO GENERALLY ALL AREAS THAT RECEIVED SOME RAINFALL YESTERDAY...AND 
PARTIAL CLEARING OCCURRED EARLY THIS MORNING. THE FOG IS ALSO 
HIGHLIGHTED IN OUR SHORT TERM FORECAST.

GENERALLY DRIER AIR WORKING INTO THE REGION TODAY...AND SHOULD SEE 
AT LEAST PARTIAL SUNSHINE AFTER AREAS OF FOG DISSIPATE. AMOUNT OF 
INSTABILITY IS NOT IMPRESSIVE...SO THINK THAT ANY CONVECTION WILL BE 
MORE ISOLATED IN NATURE THIS AFTERNOON. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR 
WEST SEEMS TO HAVE STALLED ACROSS WRN KY AND W TN...WITH NOT MUCH 
SUPPORT AT 850 MB LEVEL...EXCEPT FURTHER NW INTO THE MID MISS AND 
WRN OH VALLEY REGIONS.

ONE FEATURE THAT MAY HELP TO INCREASE CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND STORMS 
BY LATE AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING...IS THE UPPER LOW OVER THE 
WESTERN GREAT LAKES THIS MORNING. SHORT RANGE MODELS SEEM TO DEPICT 
A SHORTWAVE DROPPING SE OUT OF THE OPENING UPPER LOW...WHICH WOULD 
APPEAR TO AFFECT AT LEAST NRN PLATEAU TO SW VA AREAS BY 00Z TO 06Z
TUESDAY. THIS CONVECTION SHOULD BE WEAKENING WITH LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEAT...SO JUST INCREASED POPS THIS EVENING NEAR JKL AND CRW FORECAST 
AREA BORDERS. NAM/WRF INDICATES 850 MB THETA E RIDGE AND DECENT LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE THIS EVENING.

OTHERWISE...MAX TEMPS TRICKY AS NOTED YESTERDAY WITH A WIDE RANGE 
FROM CHA TO TRI. DECIDED TO STICK CLOSE TO GFS MOS IN THE SOUTH WERE 
DRIEST CONDITIONS LINGER...AND A BIT OF A MOS BLEND ELSEWHERE. MOS

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...GREAT LAKES TROUGH STILL THE
MAIN FEATURE AT START OF THIS PERIOD WITH A WEAK FRONT LOOKING TO
PUSH THROUGH THE AREA TUESDAY. HAVE LEFT IN SOME LIGHT POPS FOR
TUESDAY DUE TO SLIGHT INSTABILITY AND FROPA. FORECAST TURNS DRY FOR
WEDNESDAY AS TROUGH EXITS AND RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD IN FROM WEST.
ALL MODELS SHOW DISTURBANCE TRACKING THROUGH REGION LATE WED/WED
NIGHT...WRF MOS SHOW POPS...BUT ALL OTHER MODELS CHECKED KEPT AREA
DRY DUE TO LACK OF MOISTURE. WILL NEED TO WATCH FOR THIS FEATRURE
AND AVAILABLE MOISTURE IN LATER PERIODS.

RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD LATER IN THE WEEK AND INTO THIS WEEKEND.
DONT SEE REASON MEX POPS ARE AT OR ABOVE CLIMO DURING THIS PERIOD.
THINK THAT DEW POINTS IN MOS ARE TOO HIGH FOR THIS SITUATION
CONSIDERING CURRENT DEW POINTS ALONG GULF...GULF WATER TEMPS...HOW
AFTERNOON DEW POINTS FELL DURING LAST RIDGE...AND FACT THAT 00Z GFS
INITIALIZED DEW POINTS VERY POORLY IN PLAINS THROUGH WESTERN GULF.
HAVE KEPT FORECAST MOSTLY DRY DURING RIDGE EVENT...THOUGH DID KEEP
LIGHT POPS FOR SUNDAY THAT WERE ALREADY THERE SINCE IT IS STILL 6
DAYS AWAY.

FOR TEMPS HAVE KEPT PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE IN EARLY PERIODS...BUT
HAVE GONE ABOVE GUIDANCE ON MAX TEMPS IN LATER PERIODS BY A COUPLE OF
DEGREES AND HAVE G0NE COOLER THAN GUIDANCE ON MIN TEMPS IN LATER

.DISCUSSION...AXIS OF SHORT WAVE TROUGH NW OF BARRY LOW MOVING NE OF
THE MRX CWA THIS MORNING. MID/UPR LEVEL CLOUDS AND LIGHT RAIN HAS KEPT
TEMPS DOWN NE AREA THIS MORNING. REGENERATING SHOWERS AND TSTMS OVER 
E KY THIS MORNING APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH WEAKENING SHEAR AXIS
THAT MAY SHIFT INTO SW VA WHILE CONTINUING TO WEAK. KEPT THE LIKELY 
POPS GOING IN THOSE AREA. FARTHER S...CLOUDS ARE THINNING AND TEMPS 
ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHER AREAS WILL RISE ACCORDINGLY
...DESTABILIZING ATMOSPHERE FOR THIS AFTERNOON. GOOD TSTM COVERAGE
CAN BE ANTICIPATED MOVING IN FROM THE WEST LATER TODAY. NO MODEL
OF CHOICE. SON  

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH 
REMNANTS OF T.S. BARRY HAS BEEN SPREADING SOME SHOWERS WESTWARD FROM 
NE GA AND THE CAROLINAS. NOTE SURE HOW MUCH OF THESE SHOWERS ARE 
ACTUALLY SPILLING ACROSS THE MTNS...BUT A LINE OF MODERATE TO 
BRIEFLY HEAVY SHOWERS DID DEVELOP ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES 
NEAR OQT AND TYS. THESE SHOWERS MOVED SW THEN S AND WERE ABOUT TO 
DISSIPATE. 

LATER THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON...REMNANTS OF BARRY MOVE FURTHER NE 
UP THE COAST...AND MAY ALLOW PARTIAL BREAKUP OF CLOUDS TO ALLOW 
ATMOSPHERE TO DESTABILIZE AHEAD OF THE UPSTREAM TROUGH AND WEAK COLD 
FRONT TO THE WNW. SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY AND LIFT FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS...AT LEAST SCATTERED IN COVERAGE. PREVIOUS FORECAST 
GRIDS AND POPS LOOKED GOOD OVERALL. DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE MUCH 
THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS...GIVEN WEAK WIND FIELDS THIS MORNING...
THEN UNIDIRECTIONAL WESTERLIES WITH LITTLE SPEED SHEAR THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING WHEN BEST INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED.
FREEZING LEVEL AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS REMAIN ON THE HIGH SIDE AS 
WELL.

OTHERWISE...GFS MOS PERFORMED WELL FOR YESTERDAY MAXES...AND GIVEN 
MASS OF MID AND HIGH CLOUDS...THEN CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION (PCPN)... 
I WENT CLOSE TO THE COOLER GFS HIGH TEMPS FOR TODAY. A BLEND OF MOS 
FOR MINS TONIGHT SEEMED BEST BET.

LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF PERIOD 
LARGE GREAT LAKES LONG WAVE TROUGH HAS CONTROL OVER AREA AND WITH 
RELATIVELY COOL MID LEVEL TEMPS KEEPS A THREAT OF SOME DEEP 
CONVECTION. ON TUESDAY A WEAK COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO SWEEP 
THROUGH THE AREA AS WELL AND MID LEVEL TEMPS COOL EVEN MORE. 
ALSO...NUMEROUS WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL SWEEP THROUGH THE AREA...SO 
WILL LEAVE SOME POPS IN DURING THIS PERIOD WITH HIGHER POPS NORTH 
AND LOWER POPS SOUTH.

STARTING WEDNESDAY THE TROUGH RECEDES AND A RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD 
INTO THE AREA. LATE IN THE WEEK MODELS DIVERGE WITH SOME MODELS 
HOLDING RIDGE STRONG IN AREA THROUGH SATURDAY WHILE OTHER MODELS SAG 
RIDGE FARTHER SOUTH ALLOWING US TO GET IN TO WLY OR NWLY MID LEVEL 
FLOW AND LESS OF A CAPPING INVERSION.  WILL GO WITH RIDGE SCENARIO 
...PER HPC GUIDANCE...AND MAKE FORECAST DRY FOR THE LATTER HALF OF 
THE WEEK.  WARMED UP HIGH TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE GUIDANCE

NEAR OQT AND TYS. THESE SHOWERS MOVED SW THEN S AND WERE ABOUT TO 
DISSIPATE. 

LATER THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON...REMNANTS OF BARRY MOVE FURTHER NE 
UP THE COAST...AND MAY ALLOW PARTIAL BREAKUP OF CLOUDS TO ALLOW 
ATMOSPHERE TO DESTABILIZE AHEAD OF THE UPSTREAM TROUGH AND WEAK COLD 
FRONT TO THE WNW. SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY AND LIFT FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS...AT LEAST SCATTERED IN COVERAGE. PREVIOUS FORECAST 
GRIDS AND POPS LOOKED GOOD OVERALL. DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE MUCH 
THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS...GIVEN WEAK WIND FIELDS THIS MORNING...
THEN UNIDIRECTIONAL WESTERLIES WITH LITTLE SPEED SHEAR THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING WHEN BEST INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED.
FREEZING LEVEL AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS REMAIN ON THE HIGH SIDE AS 
WELL.

OTHERWISE...GFS MOS PERFORMED WELL FOR YESTERDAY MAXES...AND GIVEN 
MASS OF MID AND HIGH CLOUDS...THEN CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION (PCPN)... 
I WENT CLOSE TO THE COOLER GFS HIGH TEMPS FOR TODAY. A BLEND OF MOS 
FOR MINS TONIGHT SEEMED BEST BET.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF PERIOD 
LARGE GREAT LAKES LONG WAVE TROUGH HAS CONTROL OVER AREA AND WITH
RELATIVELY COOL MID LEVEL TEMPS KEEPS A THREAT OF SOME DEEP
CONVECTION. ON TUESDAY A WEAK COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO SWEEP
THROUGH THE AREA AS WELL AND MID LEVEL TEMPS COOL EVEN MORE.
ALSO...NUMEROUS WEAK SHORTWAVES WILL SWEEP THROUGH THE AREA...SO
WILL LEAVE SOME POPS IN DURING THIS PERIOD WITH HIGHER POPS NORTH
AND LOWER POPS SOUTH.

STARTING WEDNESDAY THE TROUGH RECEDES AND A RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD 
INTO THE AREA. LATE IN THE WEEK MODELS DIVERGE WITH SOME MODELS 
HOLDING RIDGE STRONG IN AREA THROUGH SATURDAY WHILE OTHER MODELS SAG 
RIDGE FARTHER SOUTH ALLOWING US TO GET IN TO WLY OR NWLY MID LEVEL 
FLOW AND LESS OF A CAPPING INVERSION.  WILL GO WITH RIDGE SCENARIO 
...PER HPC GUIDANCE...AND MAKE FORECAST DRY FOR THE LATTER HALF OF 
THE WEEK.  WARMED UP HIGH TEMPS A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE GUIDANCE 
DURING FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK AS WELL.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...02/12Z GFS RUN CLOSE
TO NHC TRACK OF T.D. BARRY SO HAVE LEANED SHORT TERM FORECAST TOWARD
THIS SOLUTION. THIS IS DRIER AND COOLER THAN THE WRF AND SREF.
SURFACE RIDGING AND RELATIVELY STABLE AIRMASS REMAINS OVER AREA THIS
AFTERNOON. THE RIDGE AXIS WILL WEAKEN AND MOVE NORTH TONIGHT AS 
BARRY LOW TRACKS NE TO NEAR MYRTLE BEACH SUNDAY MORNING. MID LEVEL
TROUGH STEERING BARRY WILL MOVE ACROSS EAST PART OF MRX CWA TONIGHT
HELPING TO DRAW SOME PCPN ACROSS NE TN/SW VA INTO SUNDAY MORNING. 
BARRY CONTINUES TO TRACK NE ON SUNDAY AND SURFACE FLOW RESPONDS TO 
THE ASSOCIATED PRESSURE FALLS AND SHIFTS TO NW-W. ATTENTION QUICKLY 
TURNS TO WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHING FROM THE NW. A SOLID LINE OF 
CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE WITH THIS FEATURE BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON BUT LIFT
AND INSTABILITY APPEAR LIMITED AT THIS TIME. LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
MOVES SLOWLY EAST THROUGH GREAT LAKES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE SHORT 
TERM. STRENGTHENING JET SEGMENTS DIGGING SE THROUGH THIS TROUGH MAY 
HELP INCREASE PCPN CHC MON AND MON NGT THOU NO GOOD HANDLE ON TIMING
FOR THIS PACKAGE.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WEAK FRONT PASSES THROUGH 
ON TUESDAY.  MOISTURE DECREASING ALONG WITH THE INSTABILITY. WILL 
KEEP 20-30 POPS FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY EVENING.  BEST CHANCES 
SHOULD BE IN THE NORTH AGAIN WHERE BEST MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE.  THE 
FRONT LINGERS ACROSS THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND PUSHES TO THE NORTH 
OF OUR CWA ON THURSDAY.  STILL SOME INSTABILITY ON BOTH DAYS...BUT 
WITH THE DEEPEST MOISTURE TO THE NORTH...KEPT WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY 
DRY.  ANOTHER FRONT PUSHES IN FROM THE NORTH ON FRIDAY AND LINGERS 
ON SATURDAY...ALONG WITH SOME INSTABILITY...WILL ADD 20 POPS FOR 
DIURNAL ACTIVITY FOR BOTH DAYS.  BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH AGAIN

.DISCUSSION...WILL MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO FORECAST. THICK MID 
LEVEL CLOUD COVER SHOULD PERSIST MOST OF TODAY. HAZY CONDITIONS
WILL CONTINUE WITH WEAK MIXING EXPECTED. TWEAKED TEMPS DOWN
AND DP/S UP DUE TO CLOUD COVER. LOW-MID LEVEL RIDGING IN PLACE.
MID-UPR LEVEL RIDGE WEAKENING AND WILL CONTINUE TO MOISTEN AS T.S. 
BERRY TRACKS NE. LEFT 20-30 POPS IN PLACE. SOME WEAK DESTABILIZATION 
THIS AFTERNOON COULD TRIGGER SCT ACTIVITY. ALSO WILL MONITOR 
CONVERGENCE ALONG WESTERN EDGE OF SFC RIDGE WHICH COULD PROVIDE
MORE COVERAGE MAINLY ALONG PLATEAU. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DECENT RAINS YESTERDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING...BUT RADAR PRECIPITATION PRODUCTS STILL SHOWED A HIT 
AND MISS PATTERN...WITH ONLY ONE TAF SITE (TYS) RECEIVING MEASURABLE 
RAINFALL.

LOTS OF MID AND HIGH CLOUDS MOVING NORTH INTO THE TN VALLEY AND SRN 
APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING...ASSOCIATED WITH T.S. BARRY. THIS WILL 
INCREASE MOISTURE BUT ALSO LOWER MAX TEMPS TODAY...WHICH MADE 
SIMILAR MOS MAX TEMPS REASONABLE. MOS POPS DROPPED SHARPLY...BUT I 
EXPECT ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND AREAS OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE FOR AT 
LEAST SOME DIURNAL CONVECTION. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS WITH 20 TO 30 
PERCENT POPS WILL BE CONTINUED FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...ALTHO DID 
ADJUST TYPE TO SHOWERS THIS MORNING AND LATE TONIGHT WHEN ATMOSPHERE 
IS MORE STABLE. ADDED PATCHY AREAS OF FOG EARLY THIS MORNING...DUE 
TO AREAS OF RAIN YESTERDAY...OTHERWISE STILL A CONSIDERABLE AMOUNT 
OF SMOKE AND HAZE...ALTHO PERHAPS NOT AS WIDESPREAD AS PAST FEW DAYS.

UPPER LOW ASSOCIATED WITH T.S. BARRY WILL BE SLIGHTLY WEST OF THE 
OFFICIAL SURFACE TRACK OF BARRY...AND POSSIBLY BE A FACTOR LATE 
TONIGHT. FOR THIS REASON...CARRIED AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
OVERNIGHT. UPSTREAM TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED WEAK COLD FRONT SHOULD 
PROVIDE AT LEAST SCATTERED CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION INTO SUNDAY 
NIGHT...WITH ANY RAINFALL CERTAINLY WELCOMED  


LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AT BEGINNING OF PERIOD 
REMNANTS OF T.S. BARRY AND NEG TILT SHORT WAVE ARE LIFTING AWAY FROM 
AREA...WHICH SHOULD LEAVE SUNDAY MORNING FAIRLY QUIET. MODELS IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT THAT AIR MASS FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON AHEAD OF WEAK COLD 
FRONT WILL BE MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH MLCAPE VALUES APPROACHING 
1000 J/KG. WOULD EXPECT INITIAL DEVELOPMENT IN EQUIV POT TEMP AXIS 
IN W TN IN THE EARLY AFTERNOON AND ALSO IN LOCAL AREA IN HIGHER 
TERRAIN. STORMS IN W TN WILL LIKELY FORM A LINE AHEAD OF FRONT. 
TIMING OF LINE INTO E TN STILL UNCERTAIN...BUT PROBABLY LATE 
AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING...BETWEEN TIMINGS OF SLOWER WRF AND 
FASTER GFS.

COULD END UP WITH A SOME SEVERE STORMS...ESPECIALLY IF TIMING OF
LINE OF STORMS IS NEAR PEAK HEATING. WOULD GO WITH HIGHER POPS IF
MORE CONFIDENT AS TO TIMING OF STORMS WHETHER AFTERNOON OR EVENING
PERIODS.

UPPER TROUGH TAKES HOLD FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY WITH MINIMAL AMOUNTS
OF INSTABILITY BUT NUMEROUS WEAK WAVES OF LIFT RACE THROUGH OHIO
VALLEY AND UPPER TN VALLEY. WILL LEAVE POPS IN BUT SHOULD BE MUCH
LESS COVERAGE AND STRENGTH THAN SUNDAY. 

STARTING WEDNESDAY...NEW RIDGE STARTS TO BUILD INTO AREA FOR
REMAINDER OF WEEK. HAVE GONE ABOVE GFS MOS MAX TEMPS FOR THESE DAYS
SINCE IT HAS CONSISTENTLY LAGGED IN WARMING UP ENOUGH IN WARM
SPELLS LAST COUPLE OF MONTHS. NOT TOO FAR FROM GUIDANCE TEMPS

AND DESTABILIZES THIS AFTERNOON SO CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY MAY FINALLY 
RISE TO SCATTERED COVERAGE BY THIS EVENING. STEERING WEAK SO SLOW
MOVERS COULD DRENCH ANY FORTUNATE LOCATIONS. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NAM-WRF 00Z MODEL RUN SEEMS TO BE 
AN OUTLIER IN PRODUCING A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE IN DIURNAL CONVECTION 
TODAY.  SOME LINGERING VERY SPOTTY LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS NE TN AND SW 
VA SHOULD DISSIPATE OR MOVE NORTH OUT OF THE AREA SHORTLY.  SINCE 
THE PATTERN DOES NOT CHANGE SIGNIFICANTLY UNTIL ARRIVAL OF MUCH MORE 
MOISTURE FROM THE EASTERN GULF COAST ON SAT AND SUN...WILL STAY TRUE 
TO PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR POPS AND WEATHER FOR BOTH TODAY AND TONIGHT 
(WHICH IS ALSO IN LINE WITH A BLEND OF THE NGM AND GFS MOS GUIDANCE).
TEMP VERIFICATION PROGRAM SHOWS A SIGNIFICANT COOL BIAS ON MAX TEMPS 
LATELY...SO STAYED CLOSER TO PERSISTENCE AND WARMER MOS HIGHS TODAY. 
NO CLEAR CUT OR SIGNIFICANT BIAS NOTED ON MIN TEMPS...SO STUCK CLOSE 
TO PERSISTENCE.

RAIN FOR THE WEEKEND SHOULD BE WELCOMED BY ALL...GIVEN THE EXTREMELY 
DRY MONTH OF MAY THAT HAS ENDED.  PRELIMINARY CLIMATE NUMBERS FOR 
PRECIPITATION INDICATED THAT TRI HAS EXPERIENCED THE DRIEST MONTH OF 
MAY (0.76 INCHES) ON RECORD...THE DRIEST SPRING SEASON (5.67 INCHES)

LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...PATTERN CHANGING BRIEFLY 
DURING PERIOD AS GREAT LAKES UPPER TROUGH TAKES HOLD OF REGION 
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK...BUT LATE IN PERIOD...RIDGE STARTS TO BUILD 
BACK INTO AREA.  DECENT CHANCE OF SOME PRECIP THIS WEEKEND...BUT IT 
APPEARS VAST MAJORITY OF PRECIP WILL BE EAST OF AREA.  ORGANIZED 
LIFT SHOULD BE MAXIMIZED ON SATURDAY BUT MAINLY SOUTH AND EAST OF 
AREA.  FOR SUNDAY...ORGANIZED LIFT WILL BE WELL TO EAST...BUT STILL 
SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE HANGING AROUND AS WEAK COLD FRONT ENTERS 
AREA.  LOOKS LIKE SUNDAY AFTERNOON MIGHT HAVE INSTABILITY VALUES AS 
HIGH AS 1000 J/KG.  THEN CONVECTION MOVES TO EAST.  TRIED TO FIND 
PLACES TO CUT OUT POPS AFTER THIS SYSTEM...BUT IT WAS DIFFICULT AS 
SHORT WAVES ROTATE THROUGH AREA ABOUT EVERY 12-18 HOURS THROUGH 
TUESDAY.  FINALLY DRIED EVERYTHING OUT BY WEDNESDAY AS UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDS BACK IN.

WITH PATTERN CHANGE...NOT AS CONFIDENT COOL BIAS OF MODELS ON HIGH

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A BERMUDA HIGH CENTERED OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW SLOWLY ADVECTING MORE 
MOISTURE INTO THE FORECAST AREA...EVIDENCED BY THE SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
DEWPOINTS THIS EVENING COMPARED TO YESTERDAY EVENING. LOCAL RADARS 
STILL REVEAL SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS LINGERING ACROSS CENTRAL EAST 
TN...BUT FEEL THESE SHOWERS SHOULD DISSIPATE SHORTLY WITH THE LOSS 
OF DAYTIME HEATING.

REMOVE EVENING PRECIP WORDING...AND TO TWEAK SKY CONDITIONS A 
LITTLE. TEMPS APPEAR TO BE IN GOOD SHAPE AND WILL NOT CHANGE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...RIDGING OVER AREA 
WEAKENING AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES EAST. MEAGER RETURN FLOW UNDERWAY 
WITH MORE CLOUD COVER AND HIGHER DP/S AND MIN TEMPS AHEAD. PCPN 
COVERAGE A TAD BETTER THIS EVENING WITH HOPES OF DECENT PCPN 
COVERAGE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. LAYER RH INCREASES FRIDAY AND PCPN 
CHANCES CONTINUE TO RISE. GFS/WRF SOLUTIONS BEGIN TO DIVERGE BY 
FRIDAY AFTN. DEVELOPING TROUGH OVER EAST GLFMEX IS MOVED BY GFS INTO 
FL BY FRI NGT. WRF MOVES SYSTEM NORTH WHICH GREATLY INCREASES PCPN 
COVERAGE AND AMOUNTS ACROSS S APPALACHIANS. WILL LEAN TOWARD GFS 
SOLUTION FOR POPS. MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY BECOME INCREASINGLY 
FAVORABLE FOR CONVECTION WHILE LIFT IS LIMITED. CHC POPS INTO SAT 
NGT MAY BECOME ELEVATED TO LIKELY IN LATER PACKAGES.  
 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS BRING A FRONT INTO 
THE REGION ON SUNDAY.  DECENT MOISTURE AND LIFT AHEAD OF IT.  SOME 
INSTABILITY ALSO INDICATED WITH IT.  WILL KEEP 40-50 POPS FOR SUNDAY 
AND SUNDAY NIGHT WITH BEST CHANCES IN THE EVENING HOURS.  UPPER 
TROUGH FOLLOWS ON MONDAY ALONG DECENT MOISTURE AND LIFT...ALONG WITH 
SOME INSTABILITY...WILL KEEP 40 POPS GOING FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT.  MOISTURE DECREASING ON TUESDAY...BUT SOME INSTABILITY 
EXPECTED....WILL KEEP 30 POPS FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY EVENING.

BEGINNING TO MODIFY. MID AND HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE WORKING INTO THE 
AREA. HOWEVER LOW LEVELS REMAIN DRY AND DEPICTED VERY WELL IN 12Z 
FFC SOUNDING. TEMP/DP SPREAD A BIT TIGHTER THEN WED BUT FEEL ENOUGH 
AFTN SUNSHINE WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE TO FCST MAXS. A FEW SPRINKLES 
PSBL BUT BEST CHC FOR ISOLATED CONVECTION REMAINS ACROSS THE NE

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:

NORTHEAST DIMINISHING...STAY LIGHT SHOWER/SPRINKLE WEST...BUT 
CONTINUED DRY ACROSS THE MRX CWA EARLY THIS MORNING.  HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES AS DOMINATE INFLUENCE ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE SHORT 
TERM...THOUGH SOME WEAKENING EXPECTED.   WILL SEE SCATTERED HIGH 
CLOUDS CONTINUE TO PUSH THROUGH THE AREA TODAY WITH SOME MINOR LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES EXPECTED.  ISOLATED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS 
WILL BE POSSIBLE ONCE AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON...MAINLY NORTHERN AREA 
WITH MOST LOCATIONS DRY.  

LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL WEAKEN ALLOWING TWO SYSTEMS 
TO MOVE ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. NORTHERN STREAM UPPER 
TROUGH WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES-NORTHEAST UNITED STATES THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH 
ASSOCIATED WEAK COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT.

SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE (TROPICAL SYSTEM) WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
EXTREME SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES INCREASING THE SUB-TROPICAL
MOISTURE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS WEEKEND. THE INCREASE
SUB-TROPICAL MOISTURE ALOFT AND WEAKENING MID-LEVEL CAP WILL ALLOW
DIURNAL CONVECTION TO DEVELOP FRIDAY AND ESPECIALLY DURING THE WEEKEND.
HOWEVER...COVERAGE WILL REMAIN SCATTERED AT BEST.

AS WEAK FRONT APPROACHES AND MOVES ACROSS THE REGION MONDAY AND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE RIDGING ACROSS 
THE AREA WEAKENING SLIGHTLY THROUGH SHORT TERM. GOOD DP BOUNDARY 
JUST TO THE NE OF MRX CWA THIS AFTN. ISOLATED CONVECTION POSSIBLE
IF OUTFLOWS BLOW WEST ENOUGH THIS EVENING. PRECIPITATION CHANCES 
SLIGHTLY BETTER ON THU ALONG TN MNTS. OTHERWISE...A FEW MORE CLOUDS 
WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FM THE SW. SOME SMOKY CONDITIONS FROM

OF FORECAST FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...GENERAL AGREEMENT 
AMONG OPERATIONAL MODELS/SREF/ENSEMBLES THAT UPPER RIDGE WILL 
GRADUALLY DEAMPLIFY AND BE DISPLACED BY UPPER TROUGH APPROACHING 
FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL ALLOW AT LEAST SOMEWHAT BETTER CHANCES FOR 
PRECIP...ALBEIT STILL MAINLY SCATTERED AND DIURNAL IN NATURE. BEST 
CHANCES APPEAR TO BE LATE WEEKEND/EARLY NEXT WORK WEEK. PRECIP

AND SOME POOLING OF MID LEVEL MOISTURE EXTENDS ACROSS NE PORTION OF 
MRX CWA. ISOLATED CONVECTION POSSIBLE ALONG THAT BOUNDARY THIS AFTN. 
SMOKE FROM SOUTHERN FIRES GETTING CLOSE TO SW TIP OF MRX CWA BUT 
SHOULD NOT SIGNIFICANTLY REDUCE VISIBILITY. MAV/LAV DATA CONTINUES 
TOO COOL FOR DRY CONDITIONS. PERSISTENCE AND CURRENT FCST MAX LOOK
GOOD. SON

PREVIOUS FORECAST:
SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PERSISTENT UPPER RIDGE OVER EASTERN 
U.S. AND WILL SEE LITTLE CHANGE IN AREA WEATHER FOR THE SHORT TERM.  
DIURNAL CONVECTION POSSIBLE LATE AFTERNOON OVER MAINLY NORTHEAST 
ZONES.  HOWEVER...WITH CONTINUED DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE AND MINIMAL 
DIURNAL INSTABILITY...CONVECTION...IF IT DEVELOPS ...WILL BE VERY 
ISOLATED.  IT WILL BE ANOTHER WARM DAY WITH AFTERNOON HIGHS REACHING 
INTO THE UPPER 80S AND LOW 90S FOR MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS.

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING INTO 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND A WEAK SHORT-WAVE MOVING NORTHEAST FROM THE 
SOUTHERN GULF OF MEXICO ARE THE TWO FEATURES OF INTEREST THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED. ECMWF/UKMET MODELS SEEM TO BE THE MODELS OF CHOICE IN 
REGARD TO THE NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH. THESE MODELS ARE SLOWER THAN 
THE GFS AND HANG UP THE ASSOCIATED FRONT WEST AND NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 

I HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE IN REGARD TO THE GULF OF MEXICO WAVE AND FEEL 
THE AFFECTS WILL BE MINIMAL FOR THE FORECAST AREA. 

END RESULT...WILL CONTINUE CHANCE POPS FOR THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY
NEXT WEEK AS FRONT APPROACHES THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE INCREASES. AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL CONTINUE TO TREND
ABOVE GFSX GUIDANCE HIGHS GIVEN THE VERY DRY SOIL MOISTURE CONDITIONS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THE SURFACE HIGH AND UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE ALONG THE EAST COAST WILL

CONVECTION TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BEGINNING 
THURSDAY AND CONTINUING THROUGH SATURDAY. BY SUNDAY...A WEAK COLD

DEVELOPMENT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. LATEST INDICATIONS ARE THAT 
THIS UPPER TROUGH MAY LINGER ACROSS THE MIDWEST THROUGH THE MIDDLE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE ANCHORED OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN STATES CONTINUES TO DOMINATE OUR WEATHER. MODELS 
INDICATE LOWER LEVELS WILL BE EVEN DRIER THAN RECENT DAYS...SO NOT 
MUCH INSTABILITY EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON.  WILL HAVE MENTION OF 
SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE FAR NORTHEAST ZONES CLOSER TO THE DISSIPATING 
BOUNDARY...SINCE MOISTURE MAY BE SLIGHTLY BETTER THERE.  WHILE 
ISOLATED CONVECTION CAN NOT BE TOTALLY RULED OUT ELSEWHERE...IF IT 
OCCURS SHOULD BE LESS THAN 15 PERCENT COVERAGE SO WILL HAVE ONLY A 
SILENT POP.  WILL MAKE ONLY MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN WEATHER 
PATTEN THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED.  THE STRONG UPPER 
RIDGE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINATE FEATURE FOR CONTINUED DRY AND WARM 
CONDITIONS.  THERE WILL BE LOCALIZED LATE DAY INSTABILITY MAINLY 
OVER OUR NORTHEAST THROUGH THIS TIME FRAME...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH 
OCCASIONAL LOW POPS TO COVER ANY LATE AFTERNOON CONVECTION THAT MAY 
DEVELOP.  MODELS INDICATE THE RIDGE WILL WEAKEN AND SHIFT SOUTHEAST 
DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE PERIOD.  QUESTION DEGREE TO WHICH THIS 
WILL OCCUR...BUT MAY BE ENOUGH TO ALLOW INCOMING SYSTEM TO APPROACH 
THE AREA THIS WEEKEND.  AS SUCH...WILL CONTINUE ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED POPS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.  PERSISTENCE LOOKS GOOD FOR

230 PM EDT MON MAY 28 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MODELS AND SREF GENERALLY AGREE 
THAT UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN ANCHORED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. THUS PERSISTENCE APPEARS TO CONTINUE TO BE 
THE BEST APPROACH FOR THE FORECAST. CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR THIS EVENING. APPEARS DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL 
BE EVEN MORE LIMITED TOMORROW...EVEN IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN...AS LOW 
LEVELS BECOME EVEN DRIER PER MODEL TIME-HEIGHT SECTIONS. THUS LEFT 
MENTION OF ANY POPS OUT OF THE FORECAST TOMORROW FOR ALL AREA. ALSO 
WENT WITH PERSISTENCE FOR TEMPS...WHICH MEANS SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
FORECAST TEMPS THAN THE PROJECTED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...A BERMUDA HIGH ALONG THE 
ATLANTIC COAST WILL COMBINE WITH A STRENGTHENING UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE 
TO PRODUCE DRY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH MOST OF 
THE WEEK. SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION MAY BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS LATER THIS WEEK AS MOISTURE SLOWLY INCREASES. HOWEVER... 
LAYER OF MOISTURE APPEARS RATHER SHALLOW ON MODEL SOUNDINGS...SO AM 
NOT TOO OPTIMISTIC ABOUT RAIN CHANCES UNTIL THE WEEKEND WHEN A WEAK 
COLD FRONT APPROACHES. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN CONTINUES TO SLOW DOWN 
THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS COLD FRONT...AND AM LEFT WONDERING 
IF THE FRONT WILL EVER ARRIVE. WILL PLAN TO KEEP SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND...AS THE UPPER RIDGE IS PROGGED 
TO WEAKEN WHICH SHOULD ALLOW THE COLD FRONT TO SLOWLY APPROACH THE 
FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL CONTINUE WITH A PERSISTENCE 
FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER TEMPS FOR THE WEEKEND 
DUE TO AN EXPECTED INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND CLOUD COVER.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LARGELY A PERSISTENCE FORECAST 
WITH UPPER RIDGE ANCHORED OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. VERY LITTLE 
ON RADAR SUNDAY...AND DO NOT EXPECT MUCH AGAIN TODAY WITH JUST SOME 
WEAK INSTABILITY AND NO ORGANIZED FORCING.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS IN THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...CENTRAL AND NORTHERN MOUNTAINS AND SW 
VA FOR THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY THIS EVENING...AND SUSPECT EVEN 
THAT MAY BE OVERDONE.  A COUPLE OF ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE POPPED UP 
AGAIN DURING THE NIGHTTIME HOURS...AND MAY SEE A REPEAT PERFORMANCE 
TONIGHT...BUT CONFIDENCE FAIRLY LOW AND WITH SUCH LIMITED COVERAGE 
WILL KEEP POPS BELOW 15 PERCENT FOR TONIGHT.  WILL TWEAK SOME MAV 
TEMPS UP SLIGHTLY...BUT NO MAJOR CHANGES.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE THROUGH UPPER LEVEL 
RIDGING PERSISTS WELL INTO THE LONG TERM FORECAST PERIOD KEEPING THE 
DRY AND VERY WARM WEATHER PATTERN GOING. MAINTAINED SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS ACROSS A SMALL PART OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ON TUESDAY DUE TO 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WHICH SHIFTS SOUTH THROUGH THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS. FOR WEDNESDAY DROPPED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AS RIDGING 
DEPICTED TO STRENGTHEN A BIT AS MEAN RH DECREASES SOMEWHAT. 
INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE INCREASE GRADUALLY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AND 
USED SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR MAJOR TERRAIN AREAS THURSDAY AND 
THEN BROAD BRUSHED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION ON FRIDAY. 
UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED COOL FRONT DEPICTED TO MAKE SLOW PROGRESS 
INTO AND THROUGH FORECAST AREA OVER THE WEEKEND SO APPLIED LOW 
CHANCE POPS FOR BETTER LIFT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION WITH SYSTEM. 
AGAIN WENT TOWARD HIGH END OF GUIDANCE MAX TEMPS EARLY IN THE

REMAINDER WHILE STAYING RATHER CLOSE TO GUIDANCE MIN TEMPS.

A SOUTHWEST FLOW UP THE VALLEY HAS ALLOWED FOR SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
SURFACE DEWPOINTS TODAY. EXPECT THAT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL AFFECT THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...SW VA...AND THE 
MOUNTAINS THROUGH THE EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE CAROLINA COAST 
WILL REMAIN STATIONARY THROUGH TOMORROW. SMOKE FROM WILDFIRES OVER

THUNDERSTORMS SHOULD FORM AGAIN TOMORROW IN THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF 
THE AREA AND THE MOUNTAINS WHERE THE NAM SHOWS THE BEST INSTABILITY. 
HIGHS WILL AGAIN BE IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S. 

.LONG-TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE LATEST GFS SHOWS A 
MORE PROGRESSIVE-NOT AS CLOSED UPPER TROUGH FOR LATTER IN THE WEEK
OVER THE OHIO VALLEY, WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE ECMWF. THE LATEST GFS IS 
ALSO MORE IN LINE WITH THE OLD GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN. 

FOR MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY..UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGE WILL 
REMAIN FIRM ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...
WRF AND GFS SHOW SOME DRYING IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER AND SURFACE 
BOUNDARY MOVES BACK NORTH...SO HAVE HAVE REMOVED POPS FOR THE 
NORTHEAST SECTIONS. 

FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN AHEAD OF 
UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT

AREA-WIDE FRIDAY.

FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY..UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES 
INTO THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT TRAILING 
SOUTHWEST TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. WILL INCLUDE CHANCE POPS FOR

CLOUDS OVER THE REGION TONIGHT...ALONG WITH A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND SPRINKLES.  EXPECT A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN

SLIGHT AND CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS 
WELL AS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. EXTENDED THE 
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION SOUTH THROUGH THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS FOR 
OROGRAPHIC DEVELOPMENT. FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS FORCED BACK NORTH OF THE 
REGION ON TUESDAY BUT CONTINUED TO USE SOME SLIGHT AND CHANCE 
PROBABILITIES FOR CONVECTION MAINLY IN THE TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH 
CAROLINA AS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE GRADUALLY INCREASES WITH RIDGING 
SLIPPING EVER SO SLOWLY EAST WITH APPROACH OF PLAINS STATES UPPER 
TROF. STAYED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR TERRAIN AREAS WEDNESDAY AND 
THEN RAISED POPS TO LOW CHANCE ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ON 
THURSDAY WITH SLIGHT CHANCE ELSEWHERE AS MOISTURE AND OROGRAPHIC 
LIFT INCREASE AHEAD OF MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FRONTAL SYSTEM. MAINTAINED

CONTINUE TO SHOW UPPER TROF PROGRESSION THROUGH THE EASTERN U.S. 
SLOWED FRONTAL MOVEMENT DOWN A LITTLE FOR SATURDAY KEEPING A SLIGHT 
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION GOING MAINLY SOUTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FOREAST

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...
A FEW SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF NE TN...SW 
VA...AND THE SMOKIES. THEIR MOVEMENT DOES APPEAR TO BE SLOWLY TO THE 
EAST IN A WEAK STEERING FLOW...SO EXPECT THAT THEY WILL REMAIN 
CONFINED TO THE MOUNTAINS. WILL INCLUDE A MENTION OF ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THESE AREAS AND IN THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU. THE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA TODAY WILL SHIFT 
SLIGHTLY TO THE EAST. THIS MAY HELP CREATE A MORE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
AND ALLOW HIGHER DEWPOINTS TO ADVECT INTO THE AREA. MODELS SHOW A 
LITTLE MORE INSTABILITY TOMORROW AS WELL...SO WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP IN THE MOUNTAINS...NE TN...SW VA...AND NORTHERN PLATEAU 
IN THE AFTERNOON. HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE 
VERIFIED HIGHER THAN MOS GUIDANCE...LIKELY DUE TO THE DRY 
CONDITIONS...SO WENT WITH HIGHS TOMORROW ABOVE MOS...BETWEEN 85 AND 
90 OUTSIDE THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN FIRM ACROSS THE
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN
GREAT LAKES INTO FAR NORTHEAST UNITED STATES SUNDAY AND MONDAY WILL
PULL A COLD FRONT INTO THE SOUTHERN OHIO VALLEY/CENTRAL
APPALACHIANS. DUE TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT AND ASSOCIATED
HIGHER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE-CAPES...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED DIURNAL
CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA-NORTHEAST TENNESSEE-
NORTHERN PLATEAU BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY. ELSEWHERE...LITTLE TO NO
CHANCE OF CONVECTION.

THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE WITH A MORE SUBSTANTIAL UPPER TROUGH 
MOVING INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR LATE NEXT WEEK. COLD 
FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR FRIDAY...SO HAVE 
INCREASED POPS TO CHANCE AREA-WIDE. LATER SHIFTS WOULD NEED TO UP 
POPS ONCE TIMING OF FROPA IS MORE CERTAIN.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER RIDGE HOLDING FAST IN 
EARLY PARTS OF FORECAST.  SOME SHOWERS DEVELOPED AND PERSISTED 
OVERNIGHT IN NORTHEASTERN CORNER OF AREA...BUT HAVE NOW ALL BUT 
DISSIPATED.  LOOKING AT MODEL SOUNDINGS AND POSSIBLE SHEAR AXIS IN 
THAT AREA.  SHORT-TERM TRENDS SHOWED CONDITIONS IN THAT AREA 
BECOMING LESS AND LESS FAVORABLE FOR SUSTAINED VERTICAL MOTION...SO 
WOULD EXPECT DWINDLING OF PRECIP TO CONTINUE AND THE ALTOCU TO 
SLOWLY FADE THROUGH THE MORNING.

WOULD EXPECT BUILD-UPS ON THE MOUNTAINS AGAIN TODAY...BUT HAVE KEPT 
POP VALUES LOWER THAN MENTIONED IN FORECAST...EVENT IN MOUNTAINS.  
FOR SUNDAY...SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS ACROSS THE NORTH BUT STILL NOT 
HIGH ENOUGH TO MENTION ON ZONE FORECAST.

MODEL STILL RUNNING TOO COOL ON HIGH TEMPS...HAVE GONE ABOVE 
GUIDANCE FOR SAT AND SUN BY 1-2 DEGREES.


.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...NORTHERN PLAINS SHORTWAVE 
RIDES OVER THE TOP OF THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. UPPER RIDGE PRODUCING 
ONLY MINOR SUPPRESSION OF THE FEATURE. THEREFORE...STAYED THE COURSE 
WITH DRY FORECAST WELL INTO MID WEEK WITH CONTINUATION OF ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES. THERE IS SOME HOPE FOR RAIN TOWARD THE END OF 
THE WEEK AS PACIFIC UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT ARE 
PROGGED TO MAKE PROGRESS INTO THE EASTERN U.S. THERE IS SOME 
SKEPTICISM AS TO THE STRENGTH OF THIS SYSTEM AND ITS ABILITY TO 
BREAK DOWN SOUTHEASTERN STATES RIDGE SO KEPT POPS IN SLIGHT CHANCE 
RANGE AT THIS LATER PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. WENT A FEW DEGREES 
HIGHER THAN SUGGESTED MAX TEMP GUIDANCE WHILE STAYING A LITTLE 
CLOSER TO MIN THROUGH THE PERIOD.

343 AM EDT FRI MAY 25 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE
SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AN
ISOLATED TERRAIN INDUCED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM IS POSSIBLE...BUT
COVERAGE LESS THAN 10 PERCENT. PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND VERY DRY SOIL
MOISTURE WILL AGAIN ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM QUICKLY THE NEXT TWO
DAYS. IVERIFY SOFTWARE SHOWS GUIDANCE HIGHS ARE RUNNING A DEGREE TO
TWO TOO COOL...SO HAVE UPPED MAXIMUM TEMPERATURES A BIT THE NEXT
TWO DAYS.

HAVE ALSO LOWERED AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS BELOW GUIDANCE GIVEN THE 
CONTINUED DROUGHT CONDITIONS. AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITIES WILL DROP
INTO THE MID 20S TO LOWER 30S THE NEXT TWO DAYS CONTINUING THE CONCERN
FOR ONGOING WILDFIRES.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER AREA 
EXPECTED TO HOLD ON TIGHT THROUGH MOST OF FORECAST.  TOWARD END OF 
PERIOD...TROUGH MOVING ACROSS PLAINS MAY START TO AFFECT 
AREA...HOWEVER GFS COULD BE OUTLIER WITH MORE POWERFUL  
INTERPRETATION OF THIS SYSTEM...SO HESITANT TO JUMP INTO ANY 
SIGNIFICANT POPS. AM HOLDING ZFP POPS OFF UNTIL THURSDAY AT THIS
POINT.

FOR TEMPS DURING THIS PERIOD...EXPECT WARM WEATHER TO CONTINUE.  
SINCE MARCH MODELS HAVE SHOWN A STRONG COOL BIAS ON MAX TEMPS DURING 
WARM SPELLS...AVERAGING ABOUT 3-4 DEGREES TOO COOL...SO WILL 
CONTINUE THIS TREND AND FORECAST ON THE HIGH SIDE OF GUIDANCE FOR 
MAX TEMPS. FOR MIN TEMPS THERE IS MUCH LESS OF A TREND...WILL GO 
CLOSER TO GUIDANCE...ALTHOUGH WILL GO ABOVE GUIDANCE TOWARD END OF 
PERIOD WHEN DEW POINTS SHOULD BE SURGING WITH APPROACHING TROUGH.

.DISCUSSION...ISOLATED SHOWERS THAT DEVELOPED OVER SW VA AND NE TN 
HAD DISSIPATED...WITH A LATE AND LONELY SHOWER OVER THE SMOKIES IN 
BLOUNT COUNTY LINGERING AT THIS TIME. THIS SHOWER SHOULD DISSIPATE 
VERY SHORTLY WITH CLEARING SKIES EXPECTED.

OTHERWISE...FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK FOR OVERNIGHT WITH NO UPDATES 
PLANNED FOR THE ZFPMRX PRODUCT. WILL MONITOR HOURLY TEMPS AND DEW

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE NEAR THE MID ATLANTIC COAST WILL CONTINUE TO EXTEND 
WEST OVER THE AREA THROUGH FRIDAY. WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN THE 
FLOW...A PERSISTENCE FORECAST WILL BE USED...AND TOMORROW SHOULD BE 
VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY. WILL NOT INCLUDE ANY POPS FOR TOMORROW AS 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW SLIGHTLY WARMER MIDLEVEL TEMPERATURES 
TOMORROW...AND THUS THE STABILITY MAY BE A BIT HIGHER. GIVEN THE 
LACK OF SHOWERS SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON...CHANCES TOMORROW LOOK EVEN 
LESS PROMISING. TEMPERATURES WILL BE BASED ON PERSISTENCE...WITH 
LOWS TONIGHT IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S...AND HIGHS FRIDAY IN THE 
80S.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
REMAIN IN CONTROL OF AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND INTO NEXT 
WEEK PROVIDING DRY AND WARM CONDITIONS THROUGHOUT.   APPROACHING 
FRONTAL BOUNDARIES WILL BE HARD PRESSED TO PUSH MUCH SOUTH OF THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY.  AS A RESULT...THERE WILL BE ONLY A VERY SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF A STRAY MOUNTAIN SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM DURING THE LATE 
AFTERNOON HOURS BUT MOISTURE IS LIMITED AND INSTABILITY MINIMAL SO 
FOR NOW WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY THROUGH MID WEEK.  MODELS WANTING TO 
BRING IN NEXT SYSTEM BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.  HOWEVER...RUN TO RUN 
CONSISTENCY QUIET POOR AND CONFIDENCE IS LOW.  HAVE WENT DRY FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND PUSHED LOW POPS BACK INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
A FORECAST OF PERSISTENCE WILL LIKELY BE THE BEST BET TODAY AS
LITTLE HAS CHNAGED IN THE PAST 24 HOURS. SURFACE DEWPOINTS ARE
SLIGHTLY HIGHER...AND TEMPERATURES ARE SLIGHTLY LOWER. EXPECT THAT
HIGHS WILL BE JUST A DEGREE OR TWO LOWER THAN YESTERDAY. WITH A
SOUTHEAST UPSLOPE FLOW...SOME CU ARE BEGINNING TO FORM IN THE
MOUNTAINS...AND EXPECT THAT THE PLATEAU WILL SOON FOLLOW. SOME CU
MAY DEVELOP ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS...SO THE UPDATE WILL ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE POP TO THE
MOUNTAINS...PLATEAU..AND SW VA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE DOMINATING OUR WEATHER 
FOR THE SHORT TERM.  MODELS INDICATING A WEAK SHORTWAVE ROTATING OVER 
THE RIDGE TODAY...BUT BEST MOISTURE...LIFT AND INSTABILITY REMAINS 
TO THE NORTH OF OUR CWA...SO WILL KEEP TODAY AND TONIGHT DRY.  ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES SHOULD CONTINUE AGAIN TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A TYPICAL PATTERN FOR MID- 
SUMMER WILL CONTINUE OVER MOST OF THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
OF NEXT WEEK. A BERMUDA HIGH IS PROGGED TO REMAIN OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC AND WILL DOMINATE MUCH OF THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE MIDDLE 
OF NEXT WEEK. ALSO...ZONAL UPPER-LEVEL FLOW THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF 
NEXT WEEK SHOULD PREVENT ANY COLD FRONTS FROM MOVING FURTHER SOUTH 
THAN THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. GFS MODEL INDICATES SOME ISOLATED 
DIURNAL CONVECTION ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS BY THE FIRST OF NEXT WEEK... 
BUT WITH SOUNDINGS REVEALING ONLY A SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE...WILL 
CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST THROUGH TUESDAY. MOISTURE IS PROGGED TO 
INCREASE BY WEDNESDAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH SEEMS TO 
JUSTIFY INCLUDING A SLIGHT CHANCE POP. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL CONTINUE 
WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...WITH 
TEMPS REMAINING ABOVE NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. ...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DOMINATE THE WEATHER PATTERN WITH SOME MINOR WEAKNESS IN THE 
NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA ALLOWING SOME ATLANTIC MOISTURE 
TO SNEAK OVER THE MOUNTAINS.  SCATTERED SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED OVER 
THE HIGHER RIDGES AND A FEW OF THESE HAVE DRIFTED OVER EXTREME 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.  THESE WILL LIKELY 
LINGER INTO THE EARLY EVENING HOURS THEN DIMINISH.  DO NOT SEE A 
REPEAT OF THIS ON THURSDAY AS MOISTURE AGAIN BECOMES LIMITED.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
PERSIST OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FOR MUCH OF THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD.  A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE IN FROM THE 
NORTHWEST THIS WEEKEND AND ANOTHER ON MONDAY...THESE ARE NOT 
EXPECTED TO REACH ANY FURTHER SOUTH THAN THE OHIO VALLEY.  
HOWEVER...THE CURRENT GFS RUN DOES BRING A FRONTAL PASSAGE THROUGH 
ON WEDNESDAY.  CONFIDENCE IS VERY LOW WITH THIS FEATURE AS IT IS A 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE FROM PRIOR RUNS AND WILL HOLD OFF ON INTRODUCING 
ASSOCIATED PRECIP UNTIL I SEE SOME CONSISTENCY.  THEREFORE...HAVE 
KEPT FORECAST AREA DRY THROUGH THE PERIOD FOR NOW AND STAYED CLOSE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...DROUGHT CONDITIONS 
PREVAILING WITH DEEP MIXING DURING THE DAY BRINGING DOWN DRIER AIR 
FROM ALOFT TO SURFACE DROPING DEW POINT VALUES BY 10+ DEGREES SOME 
PLACES...THEN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE QUICKLY RECOVERING AT NIGHT.  
DEEPER MOISTURE SHOULD BE MAKING ITS WAY BACK INTO THE AREA AS MORE 
FLOW FROM ATLANTIC PUMPS INTO AREA LATE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...SO 
DONT EXPECT DEW POINTS TO DROP AS MUCH WEDNESDAY.  

WITH MOIST UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE MOUNTAINS IN THE EASTERN FRINGE OF 
FORECAST AREA THINK SCATTERED CONVECTION COULD FIRE NEAR RIDGETOPS 
WEDNESDAY.  BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON DEEP ELY TO SELY FLOW SHOULD TAKE 
ANY DEVELOPMENT SLOWLY DEEPER INTO OUR AREA.  HOWEVER...WITH DRY 
NATURE OF CURRENT SITUATION...FIGURE ON DOWNPLAYING CHANCES OF 
PRECIP AND QPF OVERALL.

SMOKE OVER GA TODAY SHOULD CONTINUE TO WAFT ITS WAY INTO SE TN/SW NC

THOUGH THE PRESSURE FIELD WILL JUMP A HAIR UP AND THE GRADIENT,  
ALBEIT VERY WEAK, WILL TEND TO TURN THE WINDS IN THE NORTHEAST 
SECTIONS TO THE SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE SURFACE HIGH IN THE 
MID-ATLANTIC STATES. TERRAIN WILL KEEP THEM FROM TURNING, THOUGH, 
AND THEY WILL END UP LIGHT AND VARIABLE IN DIRECTION. 

MODELS ADVERTISING SOME LIFT, AN INCREASE IN BOUNDARY LAYER RH, AND 
SOME INSTABILITY MAINLY NORTHEAST OF A CARTER COUNTY-WISE COUNTY 
LINE, OUT IN THE LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON PERIOD, BUT THEYVE DONE 
THIS BEFORE AND NOTHING HAPPENED. HAVE DROPPED POPS FOR TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN 
CONTROL OVER THE REGION THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED.  A WEAK IMPULSE 
ROTATING THROUGH THE HIGH COMBINED WITH WEAK DIURNAL INSTABILITY 
COULD POTENTIALLY GENERATE A STRAY SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM OVER HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS FAR NORTH AND EAST ON WEDNESDAY...BUT MOISTURE REMAINS 
LIMITING FACTOR.  A FEW BITS OF LIFT AND OCCASIONAL LATE DAY 
INSTABILITY EXPECTED THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED...BUT WITH 
CONTINUED LACK ON MOISTURE...WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY THURSDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
242 AM EDT MON MAY 21 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUING ACROSS MOST OF THE SOUTHEAST. THIS COLD FRONT IS NOT 
EXPECTED TO MAKE MUCH PROGRESS TO THE SOUTH TODAY...AS AN UPPER- 
LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN PART OF THE NATION. 
THUS...THINK THAT THIS FRONT WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA 
THROUGH TONIGHT...AND WILL NOT MENTION ANY PRECIP CHANCES. AS FOR 
TEMPS...HIGHS SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER TODAY COMPARED TO 
YESTERDAY...WITH THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE FORECAST AREA.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...PERSISTENT SUMMER-LIKE PATTERN 
EXPECTED TO CONTINUE AS UPPER RIDGE HOLDS STRONG OVER THE 
SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. MODELS AND ENSEMBLES GENERALLY AGREE THAT 
MOISTURE WILL INCREASE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON 
WEDNESDAY AS SOUTHEAST FLOW COMMENCES AROUND PERIPHERY OF UPPER 
RIDGE CENTERED OVER PENNSYLVANIA AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD. HOWEVER...THIS FLOW WILL GENERALLY BE DOWNSLOPE IN 
NATURE FOR THIS SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. THUS BELIEVE GFS POPS ARE 
SOMEWHAT OVERDONE AND WERE UNDERCUT TO SLIGHT CHANCE OVER MOST OF
THE FORECAST AREA. UPPER RIDGE DEAMPLIFIES SLIGHTLY BY LATE IN THE
WORK WEEK ALLOWING SURFACE FRONT TO APPROACH OUR AREA.
HOWEVER...APPEARS THAT ONCE AGAIN FRONT WILL NOT PROGRESS THIS FAR
AND NO ORGANIZED PRECIP EVENT IS ANTICIPATED THROUGH THE LONG TERM
PERIOD. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE VALUES FAIRLY
CLOSELY.

.DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE WEATHER FOR 
THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE.  NO CHANGES PLANNED TO CURRENT FORECAST.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...ANOTHER GREAT 
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH BEAUTIFULLY CLEAR SKIES AND 
PLEASANT TEMPS FOR MID MAY. RIDGE HAS BUILT IN AND PUSHED THE NW 
FLOW ALOFT FURTHER NE OF THE SRN APPALACHIANS...SUCH THAT WE DONT 
EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF CLOUDS FOR NE AREAS LATE TONIGHT. 
THUS...SKY COVER WAS DECREASED LATE TONIGHT AND ALSO THRU MONDAY 
AFTERNOON...ALTHO WENT PARTLY SUNNY ACROSS SW VA MONDAY TO BETTER 
MESH WITH THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER FROM NEIGHBORING OFFICES TO THE 
NORTH AND EAST. 

ATMOSPHERE LOOKS VERY STARVED FOR ANY MOISTURE...AS IS THE GROUND 
GIVEN LARGE RAINFALL DEFICITS FOR THE YEAR...SO DECIDED TO REMOVE 
THE MINIMAL POPS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON IN THE EXTREME NE ZONES.
WEAK FRONT TO THE NORTH...EVEN IF SLIPPING THIS FAR SOUTH...DOES NOT 
LOOK TO BE ENOUGH OF A FEATURE TO WARRANT POPS. FOR TEMPS...WENT FOR 
A COMBO OF MINS AND MAXES THAT GAVE THE GREATEST DIURNAL RANGE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...RIDGE. DRY. HOT. BUT TO 
ELABORATE...IT LOOKS MORE LIKE A JULY-LIKE BERMUDA HIGH THAN A 
PROGRESSIVE MULTI-WAVE PATTERN IN THE HEIGHT OF SEVERE WEATHER 
SEASON. DEWPOINTS LOW, TEMPS HIGH, SKIES CLEAR. AND THE RIDGE JUST 
BUILDS OR STAYS PUT THROUGH THE WEEKEND, BASICALLY. THERE IS SOME 
INDICATION THAT LATER IN THE WEEK A BACK DOOR FRONT MIGHT SLIP IN 
BUT IT LOOKED LIKE THE LAST ONE MIGHT, TOO, AND IT WONT. LEFT TEMPS 
ALONE, DROPPED CLOUDS DOWN, DECREASED POPS.

UPCOMING WORK WEEK. MODELS STILL PORTRAY WEAK BACK-DOOR COLD FRONT 
PUSHING INTO OUR FAR NORTHEASTERN TIER ON MONDAY. MOSTLY DIURNAL 
CONVECTION ACCOMPANIES THIS FEATURE PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE

PROBLEM NOTED IS THE AREA OF LOW TO MID CLOUDS IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT 
THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH LOOKS LIKELY TO CLIP SW VA AND NE TN LATER

WE ARE LEFT WITH A VERY DRY AIRMASS AND NEAR CALM WINDS. CURRENT DEW 
POINT TEMPS ARE BELOW COOLEST MOS MIN TEMPS...SO I WILL BANK ON 
CLEARING SKIES LATER TONIGHT AND GO A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW THE GFS 
MOS MINS. TOSSED IN SOME PATCHY FOG TOWARD DAYBREAK OVER BODIES OF 
WATER WHERE FOG WAS NOTED THIS MORNING.  

OTHERWISE...RIDGE BUILDING IN ON SUNDAY WITH WESTERLY LOW LEVEL 
WINDS AND LOTS OF SUNSHINE...TO NUDGE MAX TEMPS UP INTO THE 70S TO

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...H5 RIDGE BUILDS 
STRONGLY OVER EASTERN U.S. THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING, BUT HAS 
POSITIVELY TILTED TROF TO THE EAST OVER THE ATLANTIC. TROF BRINGS 
DOWN SURFACE HIGH FROM HUDSON BAY AND STALLS IT JUST OFFSHORE FROM

CENTRAL APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY DRIFT EAST 
TODAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL FAIRLY STEEP LAPSE RATES AGAIN FOR

SOME SHELTERED VALLEY AREAS OF THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU... 
SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...SMOKY MOUNTAINS...AND SOUTHWEST NC MAY 
FALL INTO THE 30S...WITH SOME PATCHY FROST POSSIBLE AROUND SUNRISE.

BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. WEAK BACK-DOOR COLD FRONT 
DIPS INTO OUR NORTHEASTERN ZONES ON MONDAY AND PROVIDES A POSSIBLE

.DISCUSSION...
SHOWERS IN THE NORTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA ARE LOCATED JUST
AHEAD OF THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH AXIS. ONCE THE TROUGH MOVES OUT OF THE
AREA...WHICH THE RUC SHOWS OCCURRING AROUND 06Z...THE RAIN WILL END
AS WELL. CLOUDS WILL ALSO DECREASE AS SURFACE TEMPS COOL AND
INSTABILITY DIMINISHES. THE UPDATE WILL REMOVE POPS FROM ALL
LOCATIONS EXCEPT THE NE TN MTNS AND SW VA UNTIL 06Z. TEMPERATURES
ARE RUNNING COOLER THAN FORECAST...SO HOURLY TEMP GRIDS WILL BE
UPDATED.

327 PM EDT THU MAY 17 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WERE DEVELOPING OVER EASTERN KY BETWEEN LEX
AND JKL...MOVING EAST TO SOUTHEAST. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD CLIP SW VA
AND EXTREME NRN PARTS OF EAST TN AT LEAST THIS EVENING...DUE TO
STEEPENING MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF SURFACE
BASED INSTABILITY. STRONGEST STORMS MIGHT BE CAPABLE OF SMALL
HAIL...BUT THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER SEEMS UNLIKELY.

CARRIED NEAR MOS POPS FOR SW VA AND NE TN...WITH POPS MOSTLY ALONG
AND NORTH OF I-81. CONTINUED DRY FORECAST AS BEFORE FOR SE TN AND
SW NC...ALTHO SOME RAINS WOULD CERTAINLY BE WELCOMED FOR THOSE AREAS.

OTHERWISE...RIDGE BUILDS INTO FORECAST AREA BEHIND THIS DEPARTING
UPPER LOW...WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.
DRY GROUND CONDITIONS WOULD SUPPORT A LARGE DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGE
...AND I GENERALLY WENT WITH GFS MOS TEMPS WHICH REFLECT THIS. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MEAN FLOW REMAINS 
NORTHWESTERLY THROUGH MONDAY AS UPPER TROUGH HOLDS ITS POSITION OVER 
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. SURFACE RIDGE SLIDES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA 
ON SUNDAY KEEPING FORECAST DRY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW PULLS A BACKDOOR FRONT SOUTH THROUGH THE 
NORTHEASTERN STATES INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY MONDAY. HOWEVER 
FRONT HAS LITTLE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH AND THEREFORE KEPT FORECAST 
DRY ON MONDAY. UPPER RIDGE FINALLY GIVES PERSISTANT TROUGH A SHOVE 
AND BUILDS ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES. WARM AIR ADVECTION DEVELOPS 
ALLOWING TEMPS TO CLIMB A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL ON TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY AS FORECAST AREA AWAITS ARRIVAL OF NEXT UPPER TROF AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM LATER IN THE DAY AND DURING THE 
EVENING THURSDAY. USED SLIGHT AND SMALL CHANCE POPS AT THIS EXTENDED 
PERIOD OF THE FORECAST TO DESCRIBE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION WITH 
THIS SYSTEM.

APPROACHING UPPER LOW WILL BRING SOME MID LEVEL COOLING...BUT 
MODIFIED RNK 12Z SOUNDING FOR HIGHS IN THE UPR 60S TO LWR 70S DID

RECEIVED YESTERDAY. TEMPERATURES HAVE ALREADY DROPPED INTO THE UPPER 
40S TO MID 50S THIS MORNING WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. A FEW CLOUDS 
ARE LINGERING ALONG THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND IN SW VA. HIGHER 
PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES AND UPPER MIDWEST WILL BUILD 
SLOWLY SOUTHEAST TODAY. HOWEVER AN UPPER LOW WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST 
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TODAY AND IT WILL DEEPEN THE UPPER TROUGH OVER 
THE EASTERN STATES. A VORTICITY MAXIMUM ACROSS SOUTHERN LAKE 
MICHIGAN IS HELPING TO INITIATE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS CENTRAL 
IN. ANOTHER VORTICITY LOBE WILL DEVELOP OUT AHEAD OF IT AND MOVE 
INTO SW VA AND NE TN THIS AFTERNOON. THIS SHOULD DEVELOP SHOWERS AND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...COOL FRONT LIES APPROXIMATELY 
FROM GA/TN/AL LINE UP PLATEAU/WRN VLY TO THE KY/VA LINE. TEMPS 
WARMER BEHIND FRONT BECAUSE OF SUNSHINE, BUT DEWPOINTS 
SIGNIFICANTLY LOWER. ALMOST MORE OF A DRY LINE. THIN LINE OF SHOWERS
MOVING ALONG FRONT SHOULD EXIT AREA BY ABOUT 21Z. SOME RESIDUAL 
SHOWERS OR EVEN VIRGA MAY REMAIN LINE EXITS, BUT WILL DISSIPATE 
TONIGHT. MUCH DRIER AIR WILL CROSS AREA OVERNIGHT AND MOST OF 
THURSDAY, WITH SMALL VORT MAX CROSSING NORTHERN PORTIONS IN THE 
MID-DAY TO LATE AFTERNOON TIME PERIOD. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH RAIN WITH 
THIS VORT. ITS TOUGH TO BEAT A DROUGHT DOWN.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH
WILL EXIT THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS FRIDAY ENDING THE CHANCE OF
WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS FOR NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST
AREA. A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA
FOR THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER...A BACK-DOOR COLD
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO AREA BY MID-WEEK. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF DIURNAL
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATE TUESDAY
AND WEDNESDAY. DUE TO THE PERSISTENT DROUGHT CONDITIONS...HAVE KEPT
CHANCE OF CONVECTION OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR NOW. 

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...HAVE TRENDED A LITTLE WARMER THAN GUIDANCE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT STRETCHES FROM NEAR 
DETROIT SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY THROUGH AR AND INTO 
EAST TX. THE PRE FRONTAL TROUGH OUT IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT WAS 
PRODUCING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTH 
CENTRAL KY AND MIDDLE TN. THIS AREA OF PRECIPITATION WAS DECREASING 
AS THE ATMOSPHERE HAS STABILIZED FROM EARLIER TONIGHT. THE SHOWERS 
SHOULD REACH THE NORTHERN PLATEAU IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS BUT DO NOT 
EXPECT MUCH INITIALLY. MODELS IN AGREEMENT THAT MAIN TIME OF 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE FROM 12Z ON WITH STRONGER SHORTWAVE AND BETTER 
LIFT. AIRMASS IS SOMEWHAT UNSTABLE THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON 
BUT BECOMES STABLE BY MID AFTERNOON WITH THE PRECIPITATION MOVING IN 
WITH THE FRONT. WILL ONLY HAVE ISOLATED OR SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS IN ZONE WORDING. BY 00Z TONIGHT FRONT WILL BE TO THE 
EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA AND ONLY A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS WILL 
CONTINUE LATER INTO THE EVENING. TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING ARE IN 
THE UPPER 50S TO UPPER 60S WITH A MODERATELY STRONG SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT. RAISED HIGHS A FEW DEGREES AND AM A LITTLE WORRIED WITH SOME 
BREAKS TEMPERATURES MAY REACH NEAR 80 SOUTH AND MID 70S EASTERN HALF 
BEFORE PRECIPITATION MOVES IN. LATEST RUC MODEL THROUGH 18Z ONLY 
SHOWING A TENTH OR SO INCH OF PRECIPITATION. MUCH COOLER AND DRIER 
AIRMASS BEHIND THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO 
DROP INTO THE 40S TO LOWER 50S AND UPPER 30S IN THE MOUNTAINS AS 
SKIES CLEAR.    

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MIDLEVEL TROUGH WITH 
NOTABLE COLD CORE SLIDES SE APPROACHING E APPALACHIANS ON THU. 
RELATIVELY HIGH MOISTURE IN THE POST SURFACE FRONTAL AIRMASS. 
INCREASED PCPN CHC THU A BIT CENTRAL AND N AREAS. NAM IS DEEPER AND 
SLOWER WITH MID LEVEL TROUGH POSITION THU EVENING WHICH COULD RESULT 
IN EVEN BETTER PCPN CHC N AREAS INTO THU NIGHT. CAA IMPRESSIVE INTO 
FRI WITH SINGLE DIGIT H85 TEMPS AREAWIDE AND NEAR 0 ACROSS SW VA. 
FRI MAX TEMPS WILL BE AROUND 8-12 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. ADDITIONAL 
LOW LEVEL WRAP AROUND MOISTURE MAY PRODUCE ISOLATED UPSLOPE AND 
INSTABILITY TYPE SHWRS NE AREAS ON FRI. SW AREAS WILL SEE MORE SUN 
AND NOT BE QUITE AS COLD. SURFACE RIDGE SLIDES SLOWLY INTO AREA FOR 
REMAINDER OF WEEKEND WITH NEUTRAL TEMPERATURE ADVECTION. WARM RETURN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...
MODELS AND SREF ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH TIMING THE
WEDNESDAY PRECIP EVENT INTO AND OUT OF OUR AREA. PRECIP SHOULD
BEGAN TO ENCROACH ONTO THE PLATEAU AROUND 12Z AND PROGRESS ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA BY 18Z. TIME OF DAY COUPLED WITH ONLY SLIGHT
INSTABILITY AND RELATIVELY WEAK DYNAMICS SHOULD LIMIT THUNDERSTORM
ACTIVITY. SOME THUNDER POSSIBLE HOWEVER AND WILL CONTINUE TO
MENTION IN ZONES. MOST OF PRECIP SHOULD BE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS
BY 00Z THURSDAY. FOR TEMPS...GFS GUIDANCE APPEARS REASONABLE BASED
ON ANTICIPATED PROGRESS OF SYSTEM AND WAS FOLLOWED CLOSELY.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
MIDLEVEL TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO DROP THURSDAY MORNING AS THE 500 
MB TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. COOL TEMPS ALOFT AND SOME SURFACE 
HEATING IN THE MORNING WILL PRODUCE STEEP LAPSE RATES SUFFICIENT FOR 
SCATTERED SHOWERS ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. LIFT WILL ALSO 
BE ENHANCED BY DIVERGENCE IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER 
JET...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FOR SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THE BEST 
INSTABILITY REMAINS IN THE NORTH CLOSER TO THE 500 MB TEMPERATURE 
MINIMUM...SO WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS THERE WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE 
CENTRAL AND NO POPS IN THE SOUTH. THE TROUGH AXIS WILL BE EAST OF 
THE AREA BY MIDNIGHT THURSDAY NIGHT...ENDING RAIN CHANCES.

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...A LARGE AND SLOW MOVING HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE WILL SHIFT FROM THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES TO THE ATLANTIC 
COAST. THIS WILL KEEP DRY WEATHER OVER OUR AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW NORMAL ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS COOL AIR 
BEHIND THE TROUGH WILL LINGER...BUT THE AIR MASS WILL MODERATE TO 
NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES BY SUNDAY. A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPS 
ON MONDAY AS THE HIGH MOVES EAST...WHICH WILL WARM TEMPERATURES 
ABOVE NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LAYER RIDGING SLIDES EAST 
THROUGH SHORT TERM. SOUTHWEST FLOW INCREASES WITH H85 JET INCREASING 
TO AROUND 35 KTS BY TONIGHT IN PREFRONTAL ZONE. CONVERGENCE ALONG NW 
EDGE OF LOW LEVEL RIDGE COUPLED WITH DAY TIME HEATING COULD RESULT 
IN ISOLATED TSTMS ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU THIS AFTN BUT CHANCE 
TOO LOW FOR MENTION IN CURRENT FORECAST. LOW LEVELS REMAIN DRY AND 
GOOD MIXING ON TAP FOR THIS AFTN. EXPECT GUSTY WINDS AND WENT A 
COUPLE DEGREES HIGHER THAN MOS FOR MAX TEMPS. COLD FRONT APPROACHES 
FM NW TONIGHT. DEEP MOISTURE AND LIFT TIGHTLY ALIGNED NEAR FRONT. 
CONVECTION SHOULD BEGIN MOVING INTO NW PART OF CWA LATE TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WITH BRINGING COLD FRONT THROUGH FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY WITH DECENT
COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS AND DRAGGING A SIGNIFICANT
TROUGH INTO THE EASTERN STATES. FOR THE END OF THE WEEK. A CLOSED
UPPER LOW WILL DEEPEN THE TROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY REINFORCING
THE COOLER TEMPERATURES. ONLY CHANGED THE TIMING SLIGHTLY WEDNESDAY
LOWERING POPS A LITTLE EARLY IN THE MORNING. PUT HIGHEST POPS IN
THE AFTERNOON WEDNESDAY. NAM HAS AIRMASS MODERATELY UNSTABLE ALONG
THE MOUNTAINS WITH GFS BRINGING PRECIP IN A LITTLE EARLIER AND NOT
AS UNSTABLE. BEST AREA FOR THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE IN THE EASTERN
MOUNTAINS BUT LEFT CHANCE IN FOR ALL AREAS IF TIMING SLOWS ANY.
COULD SEE ONE HALF INCH OF RAIN OR MORE WHICH WOULD BE GOOD FOR THE
DRY GROUND. PRECIPITATION MOVES OUT QUICKLY WEDNESDAY EVENING AS
FRONT MOVES EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE AGAIN
THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS UPPER SYSTEM TRACKS ACROSS WITH
THUNDER AGAIN POSSIBLE BUT RAINFALL COVERAGE MORE SPOTTY AND
AMOUNTS PROBABLY LIGHT. SKIES CLEAR LATER THURSDAY NIGHT AND
SURFACE HIGH WITH ORIGINS IN CANADA WILL BRING SUNNY SKIES AND
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEKEND. COOLEST NIGHTS WILL

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...
ONE MORE DAY OF TRANQUIL WEATHER IN THE OFFING AS SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE SLOWLY RETREATS EASTWARD. RETURN FLOW SHOULD ALLOW
DEWPOINTS TO SLOWLY RECOVER ALTHOUGH RELATIVE HUMIDITIES WILL
REMAIN QUITE LOW PER MODEL GUIDANCE. FOR TEMPS...HAD NO REASON TO
SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE FROM GFS GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY EVENING...AND 
CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS IN MIDDLE TN MAY CLIP THE NORTHERN PLATEAU 
COUNTIES. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP THERE BEFORE MIDNIGHT. 
POPS WILL RISE OVERNIGHT AS THE FRONT PUSHES SOUTHEAST. THE TIMING 
OF BEST LIFT AND MOISTURE IN THE NAM AND GFS IS BETWEEN 12Z AND 
18Z...AND WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS IN THIS TIME FRAME. INSTABILITY IS 
LACKING...WITH ONLY THE SOUTHERN VALLEY GETTING A LI BELOW 0 ON 
WEDNESDAY. THUS WILL MENTION ONLY A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS NORTH 
AND CENTRAL. DYNAMICAL FORCING IS ALSO WEAK AS THE SURFACE FRONT IS 
WELL OUT AHEAD OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. THE FRONT SHOULD BE 
THROUGH THE AREA BY 00Z AND WILL END MOST POPS BY THEN...EXCEPT FOR 
A LOW CHANCE IN SW NC/TN MTNS IN THE EVENING. ADVECTION OF COLD DRY 
AIR WILL ENSUE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WHICH SHOULD GIVE MOSTLY CLEAR TO 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES AFTER MIDNIGHT.

MODELS SHOW THE 500 MB TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY. 
COOL TEMPS ALOFT AND SOME SURFACE HEATING IN THE MORNING WILL 
PRODUCE STEEP LAPSE RATES SUFFICIENT FOR SHOWERS THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 
AS MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED AND LARGE SCALE DYNAMICAL FORCING WILL 
BE WEAK...EXPECT THE SHOWERS TO BE SCATTERED. THE NAM SHOWS A DEEPER 
TROUGH AND THUS HAS MORE PRECIP FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE GFS...BUT AT 
THIS TIME WILL KEEP POPS JUST IN NE TN AND SW VA. THE TROUGH AXIS 
WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA BY MIDNIGHT THURSDAY NIGHT...ENDING RAIN 
CHANCES.

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...A LARGE RIDGE WILL SHIFT FROM THE 
CENTRAL CONUS TO THE EAST COAST...WHICH WILL KEEP OUR AREA DRY EACH 
DAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN BELOW NORMAL ON FRIDAY AS COOL AIR 
BEHIND THE TROUGH WILL BUILD SOUTH...BUT THE AIR MASS WILL MODERATE 
TO NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES BY SUNDAY. A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW 
DEVELOPS ON SUNDAY AS THE HIGH MOVES EAST...WHICH WILL WARM 
TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL FOR THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...FAIRLY GOOD COVERAGE OF SHOWER ACTIVITY FROM KNOXVILLE 
WEST AND SOUTH THIS EVENING.  EVEN WITH SUNSET AND THE ACCOMPANING 
DECREASE IN HEATING FOR DEVELOPING THUNDERSTORMS...SCATTERED SHOWER 
AND SOME THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IS STILL ONGOING AND WILL LIKELY 
CONTINUE FOR THE NEXT 2 TO 3 HOURS.  SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE EVEN 
POSSIBLE TO LINGER AFTER MIDNIGHT.  THE CURRENT FORECAST REFLECTS 
THIS POSSIBILITY NICELY...SO NO CHANGES PLANNED AT THIS TIME.  IF 
ACTIVITY DIMINISHES MORE RAPIDLY THAN EXPECTED...MAY UPDATE AFTER 10 
P.M.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SOME CONVECTION 
HAS FIRED EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...MAINLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE 
PLATEAU AND SW NC.  THINK NAM OVERDONE WITH PRECIP FOR TONIGHT AND 
SATURDAY...GIVEN FACT THAT IT IS HANDLING CURRENT SITUATION RATHER 
POORLY.  GFS DEPICTION OF CURRENT PRECIP BETTER...AND GIVEN DROUGHT 
OVER THE AREA...AND WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ORGANIZED 
FORCING...THINK ITS DRIER SOLUTION LOOKS MORE REALISTIC. DO NOT 
EXPECT WEAK FRONT TO HAVE MUCH CONVERGENCE WITH IT...WITH LIGHT 
NORTH WINDS AHEAD OF IT.   WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FROM THE 
NORTH DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEYS FOR TONIGHT...WITH CHANCE POPS 
IN THE SOUTH AND MOST OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS.  WILL GO WITH 
MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SATURDAY...EXCEPT CHANCE IN HIGHER TERRAIN 
AREAS SOUTH.  WILL GENERALLY GO ABOVE MAV TEMPS TONIGHT...NEAR MAV 
VALUES FOR TOMORROW.  


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRY...TRANQUIL WEATHER 
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD PER 
MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. THE MAIN EXCEPTION WILL BE MID WEEK 
WHEN A WEAK COLD FRONT AND UPPER SHORT WAVE TROUGH APPROACH THE 
AREA. STILL APPEARS BEST CHANCES FOR ANY PRECIP WILL OCCUR WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON ALTHOUGH THE CANADIAN GEM/CANADIAN ENSEMBLES ARE SOMEWHAT 
SLOWER WITH THIS EVENT. GENERALLY FAVORED THE GFS/GFS ENSEMBLE 
TIMING...ALTHOUGH THE DISCREPANCIES CAST SOME DOUBT ON THE EXACT 
TIMING. AT ANY RATE...THIS EVENT DOES NOT APPEAR EXCEPTIONALLY WELL 
ORGANIZED AND PRECIP WILL LIKELY BE SCATTERED IN NATURE. THUS CHANCE 
CATEGORY POPS STILL SEEM APPROPRIATE. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY USED A 
BLEND OF GFS AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN GUIDANCE VALUES WHICH WERE 
RELATIVELY CLOSE FOR THE MOST PART. APPEARS TEMPS MAY ACTUALLY FALL 
TO SLIGHTLY BELOW CLIMO AFTER PASSAGE OF NEXT WEEKS COLD FRONT 
BASED ON THE GFS/ENSEMBLE GUIDANCE AS TROUGHING/NORTHWEST FLOW 
BECOMES ESTABLISHED OVER THE EASTERN CONUS.

OVER THE AREA...AND WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF ORGANIZED 
FORCING...THINK ITS DRIER SOLUTION LOOKS MORE REALISTIC. DO NOT 
EXPECT WEAK FRONT TO HAVE MUCH CONVERGENCE WITH IT...WITH LIGHT 
NORTH WINDS AHEAD OF IT.   WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FROM THE 
NORTH DOWN INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEYS FOR TONIGHT...WITH CHANCE POPS 
IN THE SOUTH AND MOST OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS.  WILL GO WITH 
MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SATURDAY...EXCEPT CHANCE IN HIGHER TERRAIN 
AREAS SOUTH.  WILL GENERALLY GO ABOVE MAV TEMPS TONIGHT...NEAR MAV 
VALUES FOR TOMORROW.  


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRY...TRANQUIL WEATHER 
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD PER 
MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. THE MAIN EXCEPTION WILL BE MID WEEK 
WHEN A WEAK COLD FRONT AND UPPER SHORT WAVE TROUGH APPROACH THE 
AREA. STILL APPEARS BEST CHANCES FOR ANY PRECIP WILL OCCUR WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON ALTHOUGH THE CANADIAN GEM/CANADIAN ENSEMBLES ARE SOMEWHAT 
SLOWER WITH THIS EVENT. GENERALLY FAVORED THE GFS/GFS ENSEMBLE 
TIMING...ALTHOUGH THE DISCREPANCIES CAST SOME DOUBT ON THE EXACT 
TIMING. AT ANY RATE...THIS EVENT DOES NOT APPEAR EXCEPTIONALLY WELL 
ORGANIZED AND PRECIP WILL LIKELY BE SCATTERED IN NATURE. THUS CHANCE 
CATEGORY POPS STILL SEEM APPROPRIATE. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY USED A 
BLEND OF GFS AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN GUIDANCE VALUES WHICH WERE 
RELATIVELY CLOSE FOR THE MOST PART. APPEARS TEMPS MAY ACTUALLY FALL 
TO SLIGHTLY BELOW CLIMO AFTER PASSAGE OF NEXT WEEKS COLD FRONT 
BASED ON THE GFS/ENSEMBLE GUIDANCE AS TROUGHING/NORTHWEST FLOW 
BECOMES ESTABLISHED OVER THE EASTERN CONUS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION
BETWEEN A COASTAL LOW AND A CLOSED LOW OVER TEXAS. THE ILL-DEFINED
FLOW OVER OUR AREA WILL RESULT IN A PERSISTANCE FORECAST FOR
TEMPERATURES TODAY. AS THE MODELS ARE INDICATING A LITTLE MORE LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY TODAY THAN YESTERDAY...WILL HAVE A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MENTIONED...MAINLY IN
THE ELEVATED AREAS OF THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU. ANY CONVECTION
THAT DOES DEVELOP WILL BE DIURNALLY DRIVEN AND DISSIPATE AFTER
SUNSET.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THE RIDGE WEAKENS ON FRIDAY AS A TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE
NORTH...WHICH ALLOWS FOR A LITTLE BETTER INSTABILITY AND WEAK LOW
LEVEL CONVERGENCE FRIDAY AFTERNOON. ORGANIZED CONVECTION STILL
SEEMS UNLIKELY WITH A WEAK FLOW ALOFT...SO WILL KEEP POPS IN THE
CHANCE RANGE THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. THE WEAK TROUGH CROSSES THE
AREA ON SATURDAY FROM NORTH TO SOUTH...GIVING BETTER PRECIP CHANCES
IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA. BEHIND THE TROUGH...ANOTHER HIGH
PRESSSURE RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA ON SUNDAY...WITH DRY
WEATHER EXPECTED THROUGH TUESDAY.

DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN RISING...AND WITH INCREASING MOISTURE MAY BE 
ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH AND PLATEAU AREAS.  WILL CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THESE AREAS. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AS MOISTURE
CONTINUES TO INCREASE FROM THE WEST AS BROAD TROUGH MOVES INTO THE
MS VALLEY THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR A FEW SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS LATE THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS ALL AREAS. THE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE DIURNAL IN NATURE
TOO.  SUBTROPICAL LOW TO THE SOUTHEAST SHOULD DRIFT SLOWLY SW
TOWARDS FLORIDA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY AND HAVE NO AFFECT ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA.  A LOW PRESSURE AREA IN NORTHEAST CANADA AND
TRAILING COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO VALLEY FRIDAY MORNING WILL MOVE
SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.  MOISTURE WITH THE BROAD
TROUGH TO THE WEST AND THE SHORTWAVE ENERGY AHEAD OF THIS FRONT
WILL INCREASE THE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM THREAT FRIDAY AND
CONTINUE THE CHANCE INTO SATURDAY. THE FRONT SHOULD MOVE SOUTH OF
THE FORECAST AREA LATE SATURDAY. LOWS SHOULD BE MILD THURSDAY
NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH HIGHS
CONTINUEING IN THE LOWER 80S IN THE VALLEYS. THERE WILL BE
SLIGHTLY COOLER DRIER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS
HIGH PRESSURE FROM CANADA MOVES INTO THE NE AND MID ATLANTIC
STATES.  A NEW FRONT DROPS DOWN INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY AND INCREASING MOISTURE WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW BRINGS BACK

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
WITH A CLOSED LOW REMAINING NEARLY STATIONARY OFF THE GA CAOST AND
A TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS...A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE REMAINS OVER OUR
AREA THROUGH THURSDAY. A FEW CLOUDS FROM THE COASTAL LOW MAY MOVE
INTO OUR EASTERN COUNTIES...BUT SKIES SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR TODAY.
HIGHS TODAY WILL REACH THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S...AND SIMILAR
TEMPS ARE EXPECTED THURSDAY. OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL BE IN THE 50S
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT. THE MODELS INDICATE A LITTLE MORE LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE AND WEAK INSTABILITY MOVING IN FROM THE WEST ON
THURSDAY AS THE SURFACE HIGH SHIFTS TO THE EAST. WILL INCLUDE A
SLIGHT CHANCE POP THURSDAY AFTERNOON IN THE PLATEAU COUNTIES.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE RIDGE ALOFT WEAKENS ON FRIDAY AS A TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE
NORTHWEST. WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND MLCAPES OVER 1000 J/KG
SHOULD RESULT IN SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON
FRIDAY. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE TROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...PRECIP
CHANCES DECREASE ON SATURDAY...BUT WILL KEEP A SLIGHT/LOW CHANCE
POP IN THE SOUTH TO BETTER FIT WITH NEIGHBORS. A HIGH PRESSURE
RIDGE WILL KEEP THE AREA DRY ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY. A RETURN FLOW OF
GULF MOISTURE BRINGS A CHANCE OF PRECIP ON TUESDAY.

SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...MAIN WEATHER FEATURE 
REMAINS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL U.S.  
UPPER LOW OFF THE EAST COAST WILL SLOWLY SHIFT WESTWARD...ROTATING 
THROUGH OCCASIONAL MID TO HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS.  
OTHERWISE...WITH ABUNDANT DAYTIME SUNSHINE AND SLOWLY INCREASING DEW 
POINTS...WILL SEE WARMING TREND CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  
GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE AND WILL KEEP TEMPS CLOSE.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...AT START OF PERIOD DEEP RIDGE 
HAS BROKEN DOWN AND CONVECTION STARTING TO THREATEN AREA FROM WEST.  
WITH SURFACE DEW POINTS RECOVERING SOMEWHAT BY THAT TIME...THINK 
THERE MAY BE A FEW STORMS POPPING THAT AFTERNOON ON THE PLATEAU TO 
WEST...SO HAVE SOME LOW POPS THERE.  AS FRONT PUSHES SOUTHWARD ON 
FRIDAY BETTER POPS ACROSS THE AREA...AND ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS FOR 
SATURDAY.  THIS SET OF MODELS SEEMS TO PUSH FRONT FARTHER SOUTH...SO 
HAVE TRIMMED POPS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY AND HAVE DRIED DEW POINTS OUT A LITTLE AS WELL.  MOSTLY DRY 
WEATHER EXPECTED MONDAY...BUT MOISTURE AND NEXT FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
SHOULD BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WARRANT POPS FOR TUESDAY.

311 PM EDT TUE MAY 8 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...MAIN WEATHER FEATURE 
REMAINS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL U.S.  
UPPER LOW OFF THE EAST COAST WILL SLOWLY SHIFT WESTWARD...ROTATING 
THROUGH OCCASIONAL MID TO HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS.  
OTHERWISE...WITH ABUNDANT DAYTIME SUNSHINE AND SLOWLY INCREASING DEW 
POINTS...WILL SEE WARMING TREND CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  
GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE AND WILL KEEP TEMPS CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...AT START OF PERIOD DEEP 
RIDGE HAS BROKEN DOWN AND CONVECTION STARTING TO THREATEN AREA FROM 
WEST.  WITH SURFACE DEW POINTS RECOVERING SOMEWHAT BY THAT 
TIME...THINK THERE MAY BE A FEW STORMS POPPING THAT AFTERNOON ON THE 
PLATEAU TO WEST...SO HAVE SOME LOW POPS THERE.  AS FRONT PUSHES 
SOUTHWARD ON FRIDAY BETTER POPS ACROSS THE AREA...AND ACROSS 
SOUTHERN AREAS FOR SATURDAY.  THIS SET OF MODELS SEEMS TO PUSH FRONT 
FARTHER SOUTH...SO HAVE TRIMMED POPS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY AND HAVE DRIED DEW POINTS OUT A LITTLE AS 
WELL.  MOSTLY DRY WEATHER EXPECTED MONDAY...BUT MOISTURE AND NEXT 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WARRANT POPS FOR 
TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...
A HIGH AMPLITUDE UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA THROUGH
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...PROVIDING DRY WEATHER AND...ASIDE FROM SOME THIN
CIRRUS...CLEAR SKIES. EXPECT TEMPS TO BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER TODAY
THAN YESTERDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 70S TO LOWER 80S...AND
WARMER AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY...REACHING THE MID 80S IN THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY. RELATIVE HUMIDITY WILL BE LOW AGAIN TODAY...IN THE 20%
RANGE...BUT WINDS WILL BE LIGHT AND DEWPOINTS ON THE RISE ON
WEDNESDAY. 

.LONG TERM...
THE UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN ON THURSDAY AS THE LOW OFF THE
ATLANTIC COAST RETROGRADES AND A TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE WEST.
THOUGH SYNOPTIC SCALE FORCING IS WEAK...THE BREAKDOWN OF THE RIDGE
AND INCREASING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE ISOLATED
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. A SURFACE THROUGH
MOVES THROUGH THE AREA ON SATURDAY...AND MAY GIVE SLIGHTLY BETTER
CHANCES OF SHOWERS...THOUGH THE LIFT REMAINS QUITE WEAK. A RIDGE
BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST ON SUNDAY...WHICH SHOULD GIVE
DRY WEATHER FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE NEXT WORK WEEK. WILL HAVE
TEMPS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO 
DOMINATE AREA THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE WITH 
GENERALLY CLEAR SKY AND DEW POINTS IN THE 25 TO AROUND 40 DEGREE 
RANGE.  THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A WIDE DIURNAL TEMPERATURE RANGE WITH 
WARM DAYS AN COOL NIGHT.  ADDITIONALLY...THE COMBINATION OF LOW DEW 
POINTS AND WARM DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WILL RESULT IN LOW RELATIVE 
HUMIDITIES CAUSING SOME FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS...HOWEVER...WIND 
SHOULD REMAIN LESS THAN 10 MPH.  

.LONG TERM  (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AT ONSET OF THIS TIME 
PERIOD...RIDGE IS FOUND OVER AREA BETWEEN TROUGH TO WEST AND 
WEAKENING LOW TO EAST.  THIS RIDGE IS EXPECTED TO BREAK DOWN IN THE 
LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK AND BY SATURDAY MORNING ALL SIGNS OF THE 
RIDGE ARE GONE AND BROAD TROUGHINESS SLOWLY FORMS IN AREA.

WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS INTO AREA AS WELL AND IS NOT EXPECTED TO 
MAKE IT TOO FAR TO THE SOUTH. WILL KEEP POPS IN AREA FROM THE 
WESTERN AREAS ON THURSDAY TO ALL AREAS THROUGH THE END OF THE

INCREASING POPS...GETTING CLOSER TO FRONTAL BOUNDARY.  HAVE THUNDER 
IN FORECAST THROUGH SATURDAY...BUT CHANGE OVER TO SHOWERS IN 
POST-FRONTAL AIR MASS FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...BUT WITH FRONT NOT TOO 
FAR AWAY...MIGHT NEED TO PUT IN THUNDER AS TIME GETS CLOSER.

HAVE GONE A FEW DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE ON SUNDAY MAX TEMP AS COOLER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CURRENT DRY AIR MASS FROM 
NORTHEAST IS PUSHING SLOWLY BUT INEXORABLY DOWN THE VALLEY, THROUGH 
THE MOUNTAINS AND STARTING TO AFFECT THE PLATEAU, EVEN. DEWPOINTS 
NORTHEAST VALLEY IN THE LOW 50S AND IN VIRGINIA IN THE 40S AND UPPER 
30S ALREADY. IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY, THEY ARE STILL IN 
THE LOW 60S, BUT THE CLOUDS ARE ERODING QUICKLY AS THE COLD 
ADVECTION TAKES OVER. EVEN IN CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES, NC 
DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE 50S. DO NOT EXPECT FOG OF ANY KIND TONIGHT, AND 
EXPECT THAT CLOUDS WILL PRETTY MUCH DISSIPATE BY SUNSET, IF THEY 
ARENT GONE NOW.

TEMPS WILL BE CHILLY WITH LOW DOWN IN THE UPPER 30S IN NORTHEAST 
MOUNTAINS AND PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA, WITH 40S AND 50S THE 
FURTHER SOUTH ONE GOES. JUST ENOUGH WIND OR WEAK MASS TRANSPORT TO 
PREVENT TEMPS FROM FALLING TO FREEZING IN ISOLATED HIGHER VALLEYS UP 
NORTH OR IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY LOW SPOTS. STILL, TEMPS WILL BE BELOW 
NORMAL FOR THE FIRST WEEK OF MAY AND TENDER OUTDOOR PLANTS SHOULD BE 
COVERED. 

SUNDAY TEMPS WILL REBOUND QUICKLY WITH AMPLE SUNSHINE. NORMAL TO 
ABOVE NORMAL HIGHS, BUT NOT HOT.

MARGINAL FOR THUNDERSTORMS. WILL MENTION ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDER...THOUGH POPS WILL BE CATEGORICAL NORTHEAST. PRECIP SHOULD 
BEGIN TO TAPER OFF THIS EVENING AS THE TROUGH MOVES TO THE EAST AND 
WEAKENS. HOWEVER A BACK DOOR COLD FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING FROM THE 
NORTH AS A TROUGH ROTATES AROUND A CLOSED UPPER LOW OFF THE NEW 
ENGLAND COAST. WILL LEAVE A CHANCE POP IN THE NORTH OVERNIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE 
LINGERING INTO SUNDAY MORNING AS WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE 
AREA...WILL KEEP 20 POPS FOR THE MORNING HOURS IN THE NORTH AND 
MOUNTAINS.  DRY WEATHER RETURNS BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN ON SUNDAY NIGHT...KEEPING SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
DRY.  A FRONT PUSHES INTO REGION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH THE DRY 
AIR IN PLACE...WILL HOLD OF THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION UNTIL 
THURSDAY...ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE IS EXPECTED...SO WILL KEEP ONLY 20 
POPS FOR THURSDAY.  FRONT LINGERS ACROSS THE AREA ON FRIDAY...ALONG 
WITH A LITTLE BETTER INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE...WILL KEEP THE CHANCE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...MAIN ITEM IS ACTIVE SHORT WAVE 
MOVING ACROSS WEST TN WHICH WILL ARRIVE OVER E TN BY MIDNIGHT AND 
TRAVEL ACROSS THE AREA SATURDAY, EXITING LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. 
CURRENTLY, SHOWERS FROM EARLIER HAVE LARGELY EXITED THE NORTHEAST 
PORTION OF AREA, AND NEW STORMS ARE DEVELOPING IN THE LOW LEVEL 
THETA E RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL VALLEY UP AGAINST THE SMOKIES. LIFTED 
INDICES NOT ALL THAT IMPRESSIVE SO WHILE THE LOW LEVEL 
THERMODYNAMICS MAY GET THINGS POPPING, BELIEVE THAT MOST STORMS WILL 
BE BORDERLINE SEVERE AT BEST. MORE A REPEAT OF YESTERDAYS HEAVY 
RAINERS WITH LIMITED HAIL AND SOME WIND GUSTS. ADJUSTED POPS UP 
TONIGHT FROM LIKELY IN THE SOUTH TO NEAR CATEGORICAL IN THE 
NORTHEAST. GIVEN A SLIGHT LOWERING IN THE HOURS AROUND SUNRISE, THEN 
BACK UP TO MOSTLY CAT SATURDAY. ADJUSTED TEMPS TONIGHT AND SATURDAY 
TO MATCH A BLEND. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WILL CONTINUE WITH SOME 
CHANCE POPS SATURDAY EVENING AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES OFF. 
BY SUNDAY MORNING...A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE OVER 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS...OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE AREA 
WEATHER FOR DRY CONDITIONS THROUGH WEDNESDAY.  MODELS HAVING 
DIFFICULTIES WITH TIMING OF NEXT SYSTEM...FOR NOW WILL BRING LOW

WILL APPROACH THE AREA TODAY. THIS MORNING...THE MODELS APPEAR TO BE 
OVERDONE WITH PRECIP IN SW VA...AS AREA RADARS SHOW NO PRECIP IN 
THIS AREA. THOUGH THE MODELS HAVE LIKELY POPS THERE...WILL GO WITH 
JUST A CHANCE NORTHEAST. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN NRM AL AND 
SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN MAY AFFECT THE PLATEAU COUNTIES THIS 
MORNING...THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES STILL APPEAR TO BE IN THE 
AFTERNOON AS THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH DRAWS NEAR. CONVECTION ALONG THE 
GULF COAST THIS MORNING MAY ALSO SERVE TO LIMIT GULF MOISTURE FEED 
THIS MORNING. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS THIS MORNING...THEN BRING POPS 
UP TO LIKELY IN THE SOUTHERN HALF THIS AFTERNOON. SCATTERED TO 
BROKEN MIDLEVEL CLOUDS THIS MORNING SHOULD ALLOW ENOUGH SURFACE 
HEATING FOR TEMPS TO REACH BETWEEN 75 AND 80 IN THE VALLEY...WITH 
DECENT INSTABILITY WITH SCAPE VALUES NEAR 1000 J/KG. AN 850 
CONVERGENCE AXIS AND 500 MB VORT MAX MOVE THROUGH BETWEEN 00Z AND 
12Z...AND WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA IN THE 
EVENING. PRECIP SHOULD TAPER OFF IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS AFTER MIDNIGHT 
AS THE VORT MAX MOVES NORTHEAST....

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SHORTWAVE PASSING THROUGH 
ON SATURDAY WITH DECENT MOISTURE IN PLACE.  WILL BUMP UP POPS TO 
LIKELY FOR SATURDAY.  SOME INSTABILITY IS ALSO TO EXPECTED...BUT THE 
SHEAR IS TOO WEAK FOR ANY SEVERE STORMS.  MOISTURE DECREASING ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP SOME CHANCE POPS FOR THE EVENING HOURS... 
THEN ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE AFTER MIDNIGHT.  SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE 
LINGERING INTO SUNDAY MORNING...BUT THE SHORTWAVE IS EAST OF THE 
CWA...SO WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY.  HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT...KEEPING SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY DRY.  A FRONT PUSHES 
INTO REGION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH THE DRY AIR IN PLACE...WILL 
HOLD OF THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION UNTIL THURSDAY.  ONLY LIMITED 
MOISTURE IS ADVERTISED...SO WILL KEEP ONLY 20 POPS FOR THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK COLD FRONT CURRENTLY
LOCATED OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY SAG TO THE
SOUTH BRINGING AN INCREASED THREAT OF RAIN INTO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA INCLUDING
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AREAS OF TENNESSEE WILL
SEE THE GREATEST POSSIBILITY OF RAINS WITH SOME SCATTERED SHOWER
ACTIVITY OVER THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CERTAINLY EXPECT A GENERAL 
INCREASE IN THE AMOUNT OF CONVECTION FROM FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT
...BUT DETERMINING HOW HIGH CHANCES SHOULD BE AND WHEN IS STILL 
TRICKY.  THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY...HARD TO PLACE EVEN TODAY...LOOKS TO 
BE SO WEAK THAT LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WILL ALSO BE WEAK. THUS...NOT
CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO ADJUST POPS MUCH FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR THESE 
PERIODS...GIVEN CURRENT POPS THAT WERE QUITE CLOSE TO MOS BLEND AND 
ALSO TO NEIGHBORING OFFICES GRIDS.

UPPER RIDGE STILL LOOKS TO REBUILD ACROSS THE REGION FROM SUNDAY 
INTO WEDNESDAY...ALTHO CANT RULE OUT ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION ON 
SUNDAY. INTRODUCED SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS FOR THURSDAY (NEW DAY 7)

THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE
TODAY BUT UNDERCUT GUIDANCE TONIGHT AS FEEL WITH THE CURRENT DRY
CONDITIONS IT WILL TAKE A LITTLE LONGER THAN MODELS SUGGEST FOR THE
PRECIPITATION TO WORK INTO THE REGION. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE
TEMPERATURE NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LOW SPINNING TO 
OUR WEST OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS THIS MORNING...SHOULD DRIFT EAST 
AND WEAKEN THE UPPER RIDGE BY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. THE OTHER 
FACTOR WILL BE THE WEAK COLD FRONT SLIPPING SOUTH WITH TIME...BUT IT
IS VERY DIFFICULT TO PLACE AT THIS TIME. THUS...I AM HESITANT TO 
MAKE MAJOR CHANGES TO POP AND WEATHER GRIDS...ALTHO CLEARLY THE 
HIGHER MOS POPS FOR THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT MAY VERY WELL BE 
JUSTIFIED. FOR NOW...I NUDGED POPS UP ON THURSDAY ACROSS NE PLATEAU 
AND SWRN VA AREAS TO BETTER MESH WITH LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS 
FROM JKL AND RLX...SINCE THESE AREAS SHOULD BE VERY NEAR TO FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY INITIALLY.

OTHERWISE...FRESHENED MANY MAX AND MIN TEMP GRIDS WITH OR CLOSE TO 
NEW GFS/GFSX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE. UPPER RIDGE BUILDS BACK ACROSS THE

THU NIGHT.  GFS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH PRECIP...BUT THINK THE NAM LOOKS 
MORE REALISTIC THROUGH THU NIGHT...SO WILL GENERALLY UNDERCUT MAV 
POPS FOR THOSE PERIODS.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH AND CHANCE ELSEWHERE SATURDAY.  BY 
SUNDAY...RIDGING ALOFT AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FROM THE

THEN WENT DRY LATER TONIGHT. WILL NEED TO WATCH FOR TIMING OF WEAK 
IMPULSES LATE TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...BUT A BREAK IN ANY WIDESPREAD

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...FROM ALL ACCOUNTS AND FROM 
INITIALIZATION...GFS IS THE MODEL OF CHOICE, THOUGH IN MANY RESPECTS 
NAM IS SIMILAR. TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z 
TONIGHT LOOKS GOOD. FRONT APPEARS TO LIE OVER CENTRAL KY, ACROSS 
MIDDLE TN, INTO NORTHERN AL WITH PRESSURE FALLING AHEAD AND 
DEWPOINTS FALLING BEHIND. BAND OF RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH CONVERGENCE 
AROUND PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH HAS MOVED FASTER THAN EXPECTED AND BECOME 
MORE SPOTTY. SOME PLACES RECEIVED HEAVY RAIN FOR EXTENDED PERIODS 
BUT SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU NEEDED 
THAT AND COULD SOAK IT UP. OTHERWISE ITS BEEN NICE SOAKER, MUCH 
NEEDED.

HAVE LOWERED POPS TONIGHT AS DRY SLOT IN WV IMAGERY MOVES OVER AREA 
AND FRONT MOVES OUT. HAVE ALSO DROPPED TEMPS A HAIR TONIGHT AS 
CLOUDS THIN A LITTLE. ADJUSTED WINDS TO ACCOUNT FOR FRONTAL PASSAGE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LOW LIFTING OUT 
OF AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT WITH DECREASING MOISTURE BEHIND IT.  WILL 
CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS FOR EVENING HOURS AND DRY AFTER MIDNIGHT.  
MODELS BRING A SHORTWAVE INTO THE REGION ON SATURDAY.  WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY WITH HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE SOUTH WHERE 
BEST MOISTURE TRACKS.  MOISTURE DECREASING BY SATURDAY NIGHT AS 
SHORTWAVE TRACKS TO THE EAST...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR THE EVENING 
HOURS THEN DRY AFTER MIDNIGHT.  RIDGE BUILDS IN ON SUNDAY BRINGING 
DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.  ANOTHER SHORTWAVE 
APPROACHES THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY...WITH STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ON 
TIMING WILL KEEP ONLY 20 POPS FOR WEDNESDAY.  STATIONARY FRONT

SO POP FORECAST FOR REST OF EAST TENNESSEE INTO NC AND VA LOOKS ON

AS CLOUDS INCREASE/THICKEN AND RAIN SHIELD MOVES IN, BELIEVE THAT

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWERS WITH SOME OCCASIONAL 
EMBEDDED THUNDER OVER CENTRAL TN IS MOVING NORTHWARD WITH THE 
OVERALL LINE HAVING A VERY SLOW PROGRESSION TO THE EAST.  EXPECT 
THIS CONVECTION TO REACH INTO THE MRX CWA AROUND SUN UP...SLOWLY 
SPREADING EAST ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE MORNING HOURS.  FRONT 
REMAINS WELL WEST OVER CENTRAL MO AT THIS TIME AND SHOULD SEE 
ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT...WHICH WILL MOVE THROUGH OUR AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON.  AS A RESULT...BASICALLY ALL LOCATIONS HAVE A VERY 
GOOD CHANCE OF MEASURABLE PRECIP AND HAVE THEREFORE INCREASED POPS 
TO 100 PERCENT TODAY.  OUR AIR MASS WILL DESTABILIZE THIS AFTERNOON 
WITH LI/S OF -3 TO -5...AREAS OF CAPE NEAR 1000 AND DECENT 
SHEAR...THERE WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS LATE MORNING AND AFTERNOON.  ADDITIONALLY...WILL SEE 
WINDS INCREASE ACROSS THE REGION WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE... 
PROVIDING LOCALLY BREEZY CONDITIONS.  PRECIP WILL DIMINISH FROM WEST 
TO EAST OVERNIGHT AS THE FRONT PULLS AWAY FROM THE AREA.  STAYING 
CLOSE TO MODEL GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD 
LINGER OVER THE AREA FRIDAY AS UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH PULLS 
NORTHEAST.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH AND CENTRAL...AS 
THERE MAY BE ENOUGH MOISTURE AND LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY FOR SOME 
SHOWERS.  NAM AND GFS DISAGREE ON HANDLING OF WAVE DROPPING THROUGH 
THE PLAINS.  NAM SOLUTION LOOKS SUSPECT...SO WILL LEAN TOWARD GFS 
IDEA OF BRINGING IT OVER US SATURDAY.  WILL INCREASE POPS FOR SAT TO 
CHANCE SOUTH AND CENTRAL...AND LINGER SLIGHT CHANCE INTO SAT NIGHT 
WITH THIS FEATURE.  A BUILDING UPPER RIDGE AND HIGH PRESSURE AT THE

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
OZARKS REGION...WITH A WARM FRONT EXTENDING FROM WEST-TO-EAST ACROSS 
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. REGIONAL RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED CONVECTION 
AHEAD OF A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH OVER MISSISSIPPI...BUT NO ECHOES 
ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. MODELS INDICATE THAT 
CONVECTION WILL BECOME MORE WIDESPREAD OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY LATER THIS EVENING...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
MOVES ACROSS THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS CONVECTION SHOULD 
APPROACH THE SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU LATE TONIGHT TOWARDS 
SUNRISE...AND THEN CONTINUE MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA ON THURSDAY. BOTH THE WRF AND GFS MODELS INDICATE FAIRLY STEEP 
LOW-LEVEL (0-1 KM) LAPSE RATES ALONG WITH STRONG LOW-LEVEL HELICITY 
VALUES OVER EAST TN DURING THE MORNING HOURS ON THURSDAY. AS A 
RESULT...THINK THAT A FEW ISOLATED TORNADOES MAY BE POSSIBLE LATE 
TONIGHT ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN...AND ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
ON THURSDAY. IN ADDITION...BOTH MODELS REVEAL THE DEVELOPMENT OF A 
FAIRLY STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 50 KTS) BY LATE TONIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY...ALONG WITH LOW WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS AND STRONG 700-500 
MB WINDS. WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND... THINK THERE WILL BE A GOOD 
CHANCE FOR SEVERE TSTORMS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY...AND HAVE UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO MENTION 
THESE POSSIBILITIES.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT

PRESSURE GRADIENT IS TIGHTENING ACROSS THE AREA AS PRESSURE FALLS 
ALONG A WARM FRONT ORV THE OH RV CLY AND LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BEGINS 
MOVING NE INTO UPR MS RV CLY TONIGHT. BREEZY SW WINDS WILL DECOUPLE 
SOME OVERNIGHT AS LOW LEVEL COOLING INVERSION SETS UP. MIN TEMPS WILL 
REMAIN WARM AND SIMILAR TO WED MORN. GFS MODEL APPEARS TOO 
AGGRESSIVE WITH PCP CLUSTER MAINTAINING STRENGTH AND MOVING NE INTO 
AREA EARLY THU. PREFER A SOLUTION CLOSER TO THE WRF WHICH KEEPS BULK 
OF CONVECTION CLOSER TO FRONTAL ZONE WHICH WEAKLY MOVES ACROSS

APPEARS DRY AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS BACK INTO THE REGION. TEMPS SHOULD 
MODERATE TO ABOVE CLIMO BY EARLY NEXT WEEK AS THIS PROCESS EVOLVES. 
INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NEXT TUESDAY AS BOTH GFS AND

.DISCUSSION...MINOR CHANGE TO TODAYS FORECAST. REDUCED CLOUD COVER
FOR THIS AFTERNOON. BUMPED TEMPS AND WIND UP SLIGHTLY TO ALLOW FOR
FOR SUN. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONFIDENCE IS QUITE LOW FOR SHORT 
TERM.  SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH TO OUR NORTH MAY BRING A FEW 
SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN AREAS TODAY...BUT MAIN PRECIP THREAT REMAINS 
WELL NORTH OF THE AREA.  MAIN CONCERN IS THAT MODELS REMAIN IN POOR 
AGREEMENT IN TIMING OF INCOMING FRONT WITH GFS SEVERAL HOURS FASTER 
THAN NAM.  CURRENT LINE OF CONVECTION IS JUST WEST OF TN/S WESTERN 
BORDER.  MAY SEE SOME CONVECTION FROM THIS FEATURE REACH INTO THE 
MRX CWA THIS AFTERNOON AND WILL HAVE SOME LOW POPS TO COVER.  THIS 
LINE WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED AND POPS MAY NEED TO BE INCREASED IF 
LINE MOVES IN FASTER AND HOLDS TOGETHER LONGER THAN ANTICIPATED.  
MAIN FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP COULD PUSH INTO THE 
REGION POSSIBLY AS EARLY AS OVERNIGHT AND HAVE INCREASE POPS TO 
CHANCE CATEGORY FOR THIS.   GUIDANCE TEMPS LOOK GOOD AND STAYED 
CLOSE.

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS HAVE BEEN 
INCONSISTENT ON TIMING OF MAIN BAND OF PREFRONTAL PRECIP FOR 
THURSDAY.  PREVIOUS TREND OF SLOWING IT DOWN HAS BEEN REVERSED...AND 
CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ON TIMING. THINK A COMPROMISE BETWEEN FASTER GFS 
AND SLOWER NAM LOOKS REASONABLE...AND STILL LOOKS LIKE SEVERE 
WEATHER WILL BE A POSSIBILITY.  AFTER CATEGORICAL POPS THU...WILL GO 
LIKELY NORTHEAST AND CHANCE ELSEWHERE THU NIGHT...THEN WITH UPPER 
TROUGH STILL OVER THE AREA WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH TO CHANCE 
NORTH POPS FOR FRIDAY.  ANOTHER WEAK WAVE MAY AFFECT THE AREA 
SATURDAY...SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING...THEN DRY SUNDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
320 PM EDT TUE APR 24 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE MOVED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. A 
FEW AREAS HAD BETTER COVERAGE ALONG THE TN/KY BORDER AND ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TN. AIRMASS HAS BECOME UNSTABLE WITH DEWPOINTS RISING INTO 
THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S AND TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 70S. A 
DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WAS BRINGING A 
STRONG SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW OF MOISTURE INTO THE MS AND TN 
VALLEYS TOWARD A WARM FRONT ACROSS KY. THINK THE MORE CONCENTRATED 
AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ALONG THE NORTHERN TN 
BORDER AND INTO SW VA DURING THE EVENING AND THEN DECREASE 
OVERNIGHT. THE COLD FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST DURING THE NEXT 24 
HOURS AND ONLY REACH AR AND WESTERN LA BY EARLY WEDNESDAY EVENING. 
SHOULD BE LOWER CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY WITH 
THE BEST CHANCES EXTREME NORTH. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN ON THE WARM 
SIDE PROBABLY WARMER THAN TODAY. I GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE WARMER MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR WEDNESDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 70S TO LOWER 80S.   

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT THE FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN DRY WEDNESDAY NIGHT... 
AS A WARM FRONT REMAINS ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM STRENGTHENS OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY. 
HOWEVER...WILL PLAN TO KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR TWO IN 
THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT FORECAST...SINCE THERE MAY BE SOME WEAK 
INSTABILITY LINGERING OVER THE AREA. BOTH THE WRF AND GFS MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM ON THURSDAY...WITH CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY BEGINNING TO 
AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA AROUND NOON. MARGINAL INSTABILITY...ALONG 
WITH A STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET AROUND 50 KT...SHOULD COMBINE TO PRODUCE 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SEVERE TSTORMS. THIS INITIAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY 
APPEARS TO DEVELOP ALONG A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH...WITH THE ACTUAL COLD 
FRONT REMAINING WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL LATER THURSDAY 
NIGHT. IN FACT...WRF MODEL INDICATES CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT AGAIN 
ON THURSDAY NIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT ALONG THE COLD FRONT. THUS...WILL 
KEEP POPS HIGH IN THE FORECAST THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. A BROAD 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
THROUGH SATURDAY...SO WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SOME 
LINGERING SHOWERS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD SETTLE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD... 
WITH DRY WEATHER AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE-NORMAL TEMPS EXPECTED AS AN 
UPPER RIDGE ALSO BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD AND 
WILL NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM THEM.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO SINK TO 
THE SOUTH ALLOWING A COLD FRONT TO APPROACH THE MID MS VALLEY THIS 
AFTERNOON. THE LEADING EDGE OF HIGHER DEW POINTS...LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IN THE FORM OF A WEAK SHORTWAVE WAS MOVING SLOWLY EAST 
ACROSS CENTRAL KY AND WESTERN TN WITH A FEW SHOWERS WEST OF 
NASHVILLE. SKIES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA HAVE BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY 
WITH TEMPERATURES REACHING THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S. MOISTURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO INCREASE TONIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO 
VALLEY. STILL LOOKS LIKE A FEW SHOWERS MAY REACH THE SOUTHWEST 
SECTIONS BEFORE MORNING AS LIFT INCREASES LATE TONIGHT AS A 
SHORTWAVE APPROACHES. AIRMASS STILL LOOKS MARGINAL FOR CONVECTION 
BUT WITH THE POSSIBILITY FOR ELEVATED CONVECTION...WILL INCLUDE 
ISOLATED THUNDER TONIGHT. MODELS BRING MORE SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE 
EAST ACROSS TN TUESDAY SO RAISED POPS A LITTLE MORE SOUTHWEST AND 
WEST AND WITH INSTABILITY AXIS FAR TO THE WEST ONLY HAVE SLIGHT 
CHANCE THUNDER. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH MOVING A WARM FRONT NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO 
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON TUESDAY NIGHT...AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
STRENGTHENS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND CREATES A STRONG SOUTHERLY 
WIND FLOW OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. WITH SOME MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY EXPECTED OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WILL PLAN TO KEEP A 
CHANCE FOR SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. 
BOTH THE WRF AND GFS MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE EASTWARD 
PROGRESSION OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS... 
AND NOW DELAY THE ONSET OF ITS ASSOCIATED PRECIP FOR THE FORECAST 
AREA UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY ON THURSDAY. ON FRIDAY...A BROAD UPPER 
TROUGH WILL COMBINE WITH SOME WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE TO PRODUCE SOME 
LINGERING LIGHT PRECIP. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN INDICATES ANOTHER UPPER 
TROUGH AND CHANCE FOR RAIN ON SATURDAY...BUT WILL IGNORE THIS 
SOLUTION FOR NOW SINCE THIS IS THE FIRST RUN TO SHOW IT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD

MID SOUTH. PUSHED POPS TO GOOD CHANCE ON TUESDAY AS NAM/GFS BOTH 
INDICATE DECENT MOISTURE/LIFT WITH FEATURE. SOUTHWESTERN STATES 
UPPER LOW PRESSES SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON 
WEDNESDAY RESULTING IN NORTHWARD MOVEMENT OF OHIO VALLEY FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. MAINTAINED SOME CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST FOR 
WEDNESDAY WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR -SHRA/TSRA IN THE MORNING WITH 
SMALL CHANCE ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU LATER IN THE DAY DUE TO 
INCREASING MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND LIFT AHEAD OF MISSISSSIPPI

THURSDAY MORNING AS SYSTEM COLD FRONT BUILDS TOWARD THE FORECAST

SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES UP SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE

ENERGY MOVES THROUGH THE TN VALLEY TUESDAY SO RAISED POPS TO CHANCE
STILL BELOW LIKELY GUIDANCE IN FOR EAST CENTRAL TN. MODELS NOW
FASTER WITH MAIN STORM SYSTEM LATER THIS WEEK WITH GFS 6 TO 12

CLOSE TO THE FORECAST AREA STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR 
CONVECTION MAINLY NORTHERN SECTIONS AS STRONGER UPPER TROF DRIVES 
EAST THROUGH THE PLAINS STATES WITH SURFACE LOW BUILDING NORTHEAST 
TOWARD THE MIDWEST LATER TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL PUSH 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY BACK NORTH OF THE AREA AS WARM SECTOR FORMS ACROSS 
THE SOUTHEAST U.S. STAYED DRY FOR MOST OF THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY WITH 
A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR EXTREME WESTERN SECTIONS FOR POSSIBLE PRE 
FRONTAL CONVECTION AHEAD OF STRONGER STORM SYSTEM PRESSING ACROSS 
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. RAISED POP TO GOOD CHANCE 
FOR THURSDAY AS THIS STILL APPEARS TO BE THE BEST CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION AS COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. FRONT MOVES 
EAST BY FRIDAY BUT GFS INDICATES SOME ENERGY/MOISTURE ROTATING 
AROUND BACK SIDE OF UPPER TROF KEEPING SMALL CHANCE FOR A SHOWER. 
QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING FORECAST DETAILS FOR SATURDAY 
BUT TRIED TO MAINTAIN SOME CONTINUITY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP OUT 
AT THE FAR END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. TRENDED QUITE CLOSE TO MEX

.SHORT TERM...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT TO THE 
EAST TONIGHT. WITH CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS...TEMPS SHOULD DROP
QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET...AND BOTTOM OUT IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S.
WENT A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN MOS FOR LOWS TONIGHT. WITH THE RIDGE
TO OUR EAST TOMORROW...A LIGHT SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS...WHICH
SHOULD WARM TEMPS UP A FEW DEGREES HIGHER THAN TODAY...IN THE 75 TO
80 RANGE ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES STILL STRONG BUT A WEAK COLD
FRONT MOVES INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES AND MS VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT
AND EARLY MONDAY. NOT MUCH AFFECT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
AND VICINITY EXCEPT FOR A FEW HIGH CLOUDS AND A SOUTHWEST FLOW
ALOFT WHICH WILL WARM MINIMUM TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES AND MORE
SIGNIFICANTLY AT THE USUAL EXPOSED LOCATIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS.
MONDAY WILL HAVE A LITTLE MORE CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE NORTH AS LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES AHEAD OF FRONT MOVING INTO OHIO VALLEY
WITH THE WESTERN PART NOT MOVING VERY FAR SOUTH. THE MAIN ENERGY
WITH THE SYSTEM TRACKS ACROSS THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO
VALLEY. HIGH TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO SUNDAYS EVEN WITH A
FEW MORE CLOUDS AS SOUTHWEST WINDS INCREASE. MONDAY NIGHT SHOULD
SEE MORE VARIABLE CLOUDS AND EVEN WARMER TEMPERATURES WITH
SOUTHWEST FLOW CONTINUING. FRONT MOVES LITTLE AND DO NOT WANT TO
ADD CHANCE OF RAIN AS OF YET ALTHOUGH THERE MAY BE A FEW SPRINKLES
NORTH. TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WEAK LIFT AND SHORT WAVE ENERGY MAY BE
ENOUGH FOR A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS WARM FRONT WILL BE TO
THE NORTH AND SOUTHERLY TO SOUTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES. NOT TOO
CONFIDENT OF ANYTHING SIGNIFICANT. MAIN SYSTEM MOVES INTO FOUR
CORNERS AREA MONDAY NIGHT. LOW DEEPENS ACROSS SOUTHERN PLAINS
TUESDAY. THE SYSTEM SLOWLY WEAKENS WEDNESDAY AS IT MOVES EAST.
STILL LOOKS LIKE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY
AHEAD OF FRONT LINGERING INTO FRIDAY. SATURDAY ANOTHER FRONT WILL
HEAD TOWARD TN CONTINUING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS OR THUNDERSTORMS. &&

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...TROUGH OVER THE
WESTERN STATES CONTINUES WITH UPPER RIDGE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST AND
TENNESSEE VALLEY SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. FIRST IMPULSE MOVES
FROM PLAINS STATES INTO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES AND MS VALLEY
SUNDAY. THIS WILL HELP INCREASE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. AIRMASS WILL STILL BE DRY WITH
TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES WARMER. WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE INTO
THE TN VALLEY AT THE TAIL END OF SYSTEM TO THE NORTH BUT JUST
EXPECT CLOUDINESS RIGHT NOW. THE FRONT MAY MOVE INTO KY AND BRING A
FEW SPRINKLES TO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS BY TUESDAY MORNING. WILL
KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY INTO
WEDNESDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCE IN THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST. HIGH
PRESSURE STAYS STRONG ACROSS SOUTHEAST STATES. THE MAIN SYSTEM AND
TROUGH APPROACH THE MS VALLEY WEDNESDAY AND THEN CROSSES INTO TN
THURSDAY. EXPECT MORE SIGNIFICANT SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM THREAT BY

REMAIN MILD WITH LOWS WARMING BECAUSE OF CLOUDS BY TUESDAY AND
HIGHS A LITTLE LOWER AT THE END OF THE WEEK FROM PRECIPITATION.

A CLOSED LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION THIS AFTERNOON WILL TRACK 
SOUTH ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT. THIS SYSTEM BECOMES ELONGATED NW
TO SE...AND CROSSES OUR NORTHERN SECTIONS THURSDAY. POSITIVE
VORTICITY ADVECTION ALONG WITH COOL MIDLEVEL TEMPERATURES WITH THE

.DISCUSSION...ISSUED UPDATE TO INCREASE RAIN CHANCE THIS EVENING. 
SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
AREA RADARS SHOW PRECIP FALLING FROM MIDLEVEL CLOUDS...HOWEVER WITH 
DRY LOW LEVELS...SURFACE OBS SHOW LITTLE PRECIP REACHING THE GROUND. 
WILL KEEP A SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POP IN CENTRAL AND NORTH TO ACCOUNT 
FOR SOME LIGHT SHOWERS...WITH NORTHERN AREAS HAVING THE BEST 
CHANCE...BUT AMOUNTS WILL ONLY BE A FEW HUNDREDTHS AT BEST. 

A CLOSED LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION THIS AFTERNOON WILL TRACK 
SOUTH ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT. THIS SYSTEM BECOMES ELONGATED NW
TO SE...AND CROSSES OUR NORTHERN SECTIONS THURSDAY. POSITIVE
VORTICITY ADVECTION ALONG WITH COOL MIDLEVEL TEMPERATURES WITH THE
LOW WILL CREATE AN AXIS OF LIFT ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN...MAINLY IN
THE AFTERNOON. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS IN THIS AREA. IN THE SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF OUR
AREA...MIDLEVELS WILL BE MUCH WARMER AND DRIER...SO WILL NOT HAVE
ANY PRECIP MENTIONED THERE. FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL LEAN TOWARD
WARMER MET NUMBERS IN THE SOUTH WHERE SUN IS MORE LIKELY...AND
TOWARD COOLER MAV NUMBERS NORTH WHERE CLOUDS WILL BE THICKER.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
SHOWERS MAY LINGER INTO THURSDAY EVENING...MAINLY OVER NORTHEASTERN 
ZONES...AS THE SYSTEM EXITS THE AREA.  HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE 
REGION ON FRIDAY AND WILL CONTROL AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  
A WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE REGION ON MONDAY WILL SETTLE TO 
OUR NORTH.  MAIN MOISTURE AND LIFT REMAIN NORTH...BUT MAY SEE SOME 
SHOWERS DROP INTO OUR AREA AND WILL KEEP A LOW POP IN THE FORECAST 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  RIDGING ON WEDNESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL CROSS THE AREA TODAY...BRINGING A CHANCE OF
SHOWERS. 12Z RAOBS AND ACARS SOUNDINGS THIS MORNING SHOW THAT THE
LOW LEVELS REMAIN VERY DRY. ALTHOUGH THE PRECIP COVERAGE ON RADAR
APPEARS WIDESPREAD...THE SURFACE OBS INDICATE SCATTERED COVERAGE AT
BEST. THUS QPF WILL BE VERY LIGHT...ONLY A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN
INCH. THE BEST CHANCES OF MEASURABLE RAINFALL ARE IN NORTHERN
SECTIONS IN AN AREA OF 700 MB AND 500 MB CONFLUENCE. THE UPDATE
WILL RAISE POPS NORTH TO 50% AND LOWER POPS SOUTH TO 30%. SKIES
WILL BE CLOUDY THROUGH THE DAY...PREVENTING MUCH SURFACE HEATING
EXCEPT FOR THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SW NC. WILL LOWER TEMPS A FEW
DEGREES...MAINLY IN NORTHERN SECTIONS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORTWAVE PUSHING THROUGH THE AREA 
TODAY.  DECENT LIFT WITH IT...BUT MOISTURE IS LIMITED.  RADAR 
SHOWING SOME LIGHT RAIN TO THE WEST...SO WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING 
FOR TODAY.  UPPER LOW APPROACHING THE REGION LATE TONIGHT.  WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING FOR TONIGHT WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE 
NORTH WHERE THE BEST MOISTURE LINGERS.  STAYED NEAR MAV GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH MOVING AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW SOUTHEAST ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN ON THURSDAY. SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE COLDER AIR 
ALOFT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UPPER LOW MAY PRODUCE ENOUGH INSTABILITY 
TO WARRANT MENTIONING TSTORMS. A STRONG UPPER RIDGE THEN BUILDS 
ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND A 
WARMING TREND EXPECTED THROUGH THE FIRST OF NEXT WEEK. A WEAK COLD 
FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...BEFORE STALLING-OUT AND RETREATING NORTH 
AS A WARM FRONT BY TUESDAY NIGHT. THUS...WILL CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WEAKENING UPPER 
LEVEL LOW WILL CONTINUE ITS PROGRESS EAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES 
INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. LATER TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. KEPT POPS 
IN THE CHANCE RANGE FOR THIS SYSTEM WHICH MAY HAVE A DIFFICULT TIME 
PRODUCING A GREAT DEAL OF PRECIP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SECOND 
SYSTEM DROPS SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES BRINING A GLANCING BLOW TO 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BUT MODEL DEPICTION INDICATES THIS SYSTEM 
MAY PRODUCE A LITTLE STRONGER LIFT AND WITH OROGRAPHICS IN NORTHWEST 
FLOW EVENT COULD BRING SOME SHOWERS TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. STAYED WITH A HIGH 
CHANCE POP NORTHEAST THROUGH SLIGHT CHANCE POP ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST 
FOR THURSDAY. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO A MAV/MET BLEND CONCERNING 
TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE DURING THE SHORT TERM. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES

LEE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH A 
STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST AND A HIGH 
PRESSURE AREA CENTERED OVER THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. PRESSURE 
GRADIENT OVER THE FORECAST AREA HAS RELAXED SOME...SO THINK THAT 
WINDS WILL BE WEAKER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY. DRY CONDITIONS AND MOSTLY 
SUNNY SKIES SHOULD COMBINE FOR A NICE WARM-UP TODAY...WITH TEMPS 
RISING TO NEAR NORMAL LEVELS. A WEAK CUT-OFF UPPER LOW WILL APPROACH 
THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT...BRINGING AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS A 
SMALL CHANCE OF LIGHT SHOWERS. WILL PLAN TO TREND TEMPS A LITTLE 
WARMER THAN GUIDANCE TONIGHT...WITH THIS EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SHORTWAVE ROTATING THROUGH 
THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY ALONG WITH A SURFACE TROUGH...SHOULD HAVE 
SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND LIFT TO BUMP UP POPS TO 50 PERCENT FOR 
WEDNESDAY.  SURFACE TROUGH LINGERING INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WILL 
KEEP BEST POPS IN THE NORTH WHERE BEST MOISTURE RESIDES.  UPPER LOW 
DROPPING INTO REGION ON THURSDAY...WILL KEEP BEST CHANCES IN THE 
NORTH AGAIN WHERE DEEPEST MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE.  UPPER LOW SHIFTING 
EAST ON THURSDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP THURSDAY NIGHT DRY FOR NOW.  
UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN ON FRIDAY BRINGING DRY AND WARMER WEATHER 
FOR FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY.  GFS INDICATING A FRONT APPROACHING ON

RELAXING EVER SO SLIGHTLY AND LOSS OF MIXING AS WELL AS SLOW

THE DEEP SOUTH ON WEDNESDAY. FEATURE APPARENTLY WILL NOT HAVE A 
GREAT DEAL OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FOR SHOWER PRODUCTION. THE GFS 
GENERATES RATHER HIGH POPS FOR THE EVENT WHILE THE NAM DOWNPLAYS THE 
SITUATION. PREFERRED TO KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE ATTM DUE TO 
WEAK SYSTEM AND LACK OF SIGNIFICANT DEEP MOISTURE.

STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES...WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT A STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TODAY...WHICH WILL RESULT IN STRONG WEST-TO-NORTHWEST 
WINDS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA. AS A RESULT...WILL CONTINUE THE WIND 
ADVISORY TODAY FOR SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...THE MOUNTAINS AND 
SOUTHWEST NC...BUT ALSO INCLUDE THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA IN A 
LAKE WIND ADVISORY. THESE WINDS SHOULD QUICKLY SUBSIDE AFTER 
SUNSET...SO WILL LET THE WIND ADVISORIES EXPIRE AT 6 PM EDT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE WARMER THAN GUIDANCE TODAY ACROSS THE 
VALLEY ZONES...SINCE DOWNSLOPING WESTERLY WINDS OFF OF THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU SHOULD CREATE SOME ADIABATIC WARMING IN THE 
VALLEY. 


.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...GENERALLY BENIGN WEATHER WITH 
NEAR-CLIMO TEMPS STILL IN STORE THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD. THE

AROUND PARENT UPPER LOW OFF THE NORTHEASTERN COAST. STILL APPEARS 
THIS EVENT WILL NOT BE VERY SIGNIFICANT...ALTHOUGH GFS GUIDANCE POPS 
ARE ALREADY LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL FOR WEDNESDAY. DID NOT JUMP ON

921 PM EDT SUN APR 15 2007

.DISCUSSION...STEADY PRECIPITATION HAS NOW ALMOST MOVED OUT OF THE
FORECAST AREA WITH SOME WEAKER SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING SOUTH
SOUTHEAST FROM THE GREAT LAKE AND OHIO VALLEY LATE THIS EVENING TO
THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. THE BULK OF THE SNOW HAS OCCURRED ALREADY
WITH REPORTS OF FLURRIES IN MOST OF THE HIGHER ELEVATION SITES.
LATEST RADAR SHOWING SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION MOVING INTO WESTERN
SECTIONS. WILL CONTINUE SNOW ADVISORY THROUGH EARLY MORNING. ONLY
HIGHER ELEVATIONS WILL THE SNOW STICK AROUND AS TEMPERATURES HAVE
ACTUALLY RISEN A FEW DEGREES AT THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AFTER THE
STEADY PRECIPITATION HAS ENDED. ALSO WIND SPEEDS HAVE INCREASED
FROM WEST TO EAST WITH STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT BEHIND DEEP EXITING
LOW PRESSURE AREA ALONG THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC COAST AND THIS IS HELPING
TEMPERATURES STAY UP. AS COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES OVERNIGHT
TEMPERATURES WILL SLOWLY FALL BACK TO JUST ABOVE FREEZING AT THE
LOWER ELEVATIONS BY MORNING. ALSO SOME CLEARING HAS WORKED INTO WESTERN
SECTIONS BUT EXPECT WITH CLOUDS MOVING SOUTH FROM KY SKIES WILL
REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY THROUGH THE NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT
STILL OCCURRING IN ADVANCE OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH THIS AFTERNOON 
...BUT THIS SHOULD BE GONE BY THE EVENING HOURS LEAVING LOW LEVEL
FORCING AS THE STRONG LOW LEVEL NW WINDS CONTINUE. MOISTURE
WRAPPING AROUND AND THE UPSLOPE FLOW...PLUS FALLING TEMPS...SUPPORTS
OUR SNOW ADVISORY. HAD A REPORT OF 1 INCH AT CLINGMANS DOME IN THE
SMOKIES...BUT STILL THINK MAIN ACCUMULATIONS WILL OCCUR ABOVE 2500
FEET AND HEAVIEST AMOUNTS UP TO 4 INCHES ABOVE 4000 FEET. DEPTH OF
MOISTURE BECOMES MUCH MORE SHALLOW THIS EVENING...AND NOT HIGH
ENOUGH (OR COLD ENOUGH AT TOP OF SATURATED LAYER) TO ALLOW ICE
NUCLEATION FOR GOOD SNOW GROWTH. 

WILL CARRY SNOW ADVISORY THROUGH 4AM AND WIND ADVISORY THROUGH 4PM
MONDAY. MIN TEMPS NEARLY STEADY OVERNIGHT...THEN FAVORED COOLER
HIGHS MONDAY WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE BLOCKING PATTERN HAS BEEN 
DETRIMENTAL WITH A LITTLE MORE WILD WEATHER THAN WE WOULD LIKE TO 
SEE IN MID APRIL. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT WE MAY BE ABLE TO BENEFIT 
FROM A MOST PLEASANT RIDGE THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST 
PERIOD  COMPLIMENTS OF THE OMEGA BLOCK. THERE IS A MINOR FLY IN THE 
OINTMENT AT MID WEEK INCLUDING THE PERIOD TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THURSDAY DAYTIME AS MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
MOVING ACROSS THE REGION ALONG WITH A MODICUM OF MOISTURE SO WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING HERE. WAS ABLE TO GO WITH A DRY REGIME 
THEREAFTER...AWAITING ARRIVAL OF PACIFIC TROF. TEMPERATURE FORECAST 
WAS A STRUGGLE AS IT WAS APPARENT THERE WERE TWO DIFFERING THEORIES 
ON HOW FAST TO RID THE REGION OF THE OFFENDING COLD SNAP. WENT AHEAD

.DISCUSSION...LOW LEVELS...EVEN FROM 850 MBS DOWN...STILL APPEAR TOO 
WARM FOR ANY SNOW THIS MORNING ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA. 12Z OHX 
SOUNDING WAS ABOVE FREEZING JUST IN THE LOWEST 1000 TO 1500 FEET.
EXPECT HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO POSSIBLY MIX WITH OR GRADUALLY CHANGE TO 
WET SNOW BY MID AFTERNOON...THUS SNOW ADVISORY LOOKS GOOD.

HIGHER FIRE WEATHER OBSERVATION SITES JUST STARTING TO SHOW 
INCREASING WINDS...ALMOST INTO LOWER END OF ADVISORY CRITERIA.
HOWEVER...AREA RADAR VAD WIND PROFILES DONT REALLY SHOW ANYTHING 
HIGHER THAN NW AT 25 KNOTS FROM KOHX. DECISION TO EXTEND WIND 
ADVISORY THROUGH ALL OF MONDAY LOOKS GOOD...AS TIGHT PRESSURE 
GRADIENT LINGERS AND MUCH BETTER MIXING EXPECTED. THUS...WIND 
ADVISORY ALSO ON TRACK AND WILL BE CONTINUED AS IS.

STEADY TEMPS AT BEST...OR SLOWLY FALLING AS FORECAST REFLECTS.
SHOWERS INCREASING IN COVERAGE AGAIN THIS MORNING...WITH SOME 
DRIZZLE ALSO NOTED. CURRENT POPS LOOK GOOD IN LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL 
RANGE. WILL UPDATE FORECAST GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS SHORTLY.

325 AM EDT SUN APR 15 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
ELONGATED AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A 
WIDESPREAD AREA OF SHOWERS OVER THE REGION. WRF AND GFS MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MOVING THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
MOUNTAINS THIS MORNING...AS A HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
OVER THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY SWINGS INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY. 
THIS UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE SCATTERED SHOWERS 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AS LAPSE RATES STEEPEN WITH THE COLDER AIR 
ALOFT. THIS COLDER AIR ALOFT WILL HELP CREATE SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATER TODAY...GENERALLY ABOVE 2500 FEET. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT TEMPS WILL REMAIN ABOVE -10 CELSIUS THIS 
AFTERNOON IN THE PRECIP INITIATION REGION AROUND 700 MB...SO NOT 
THAT CONFIDENT THAT RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW QUICKLY THIS AFTERNOON. 
TEMPS IN THIS PRECIP INITIATION REGION LOWER QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET 
THIS EVENING...SO THINK THAT SNOW WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS DEFINITELY BY THIS EVENING. WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES 
BEGINNING THEIR SNOW ADVISORIES/WARNINGS AROUND NOON...WILL GO AHEAD 
AND BEGIN A SNOW ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA 
AND EAST TN AT NOON AS WELL. IT APPEARS THAT ONE TO THREE INCHES 
WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET. TEMPS 
SHOULD REMAIN TOO WARM IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS FOR ANY ACCUMULATIONS. 
WILL ALSO CONTINUE THE WIND ADVISORY FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...AND EXTEND IT THROUGH THE ENTIRE DAY ON MONDAY AS WINDS 
AGAIN INCREASE FOR MOST OF THE DAY. 


.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...GENERALLY QUIET WEATHER 
PATTERN IN STORE THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD. WEAK SYSTEM AFFECTS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...QUITE AN INTERESTING MIX
OF WEATHER FOR THESE PERIODS...LOTS OF SHOWERS AND A FEW STORMS
TONIGHT...FOLLOWED BY STRONG WINDS SUNDAY INTO MONDAY MORNING AND A
GOOD CHANCE OF SNOW FOR SW VA AND NE TN SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH
MAINLY SUNDAY NIGHT.

WARM FRONT HAS LIFTED NORTH INTO NE CORNER OF MS EXTENDING SE INTO
NRN AL...WITH SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY NORTH OF THIS SURFACE
BOUNDARY PRODUCING ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS INTO SE TN. MAIN AREA OF
SHOWERS HAS PROGRESSED STEADILY EASTWARD FROM MIDDLE TN AND KY
...AND FINALLY MOVED INTO THE WRN TWO THIRDS OF OUR FORECAST AREA.
HOWEVER...THREAT OF FLOODING RAINS STILL LOOKS GREATLY DIMINISHED
AS BULK OF OUR AREA HAS EXPERIENCED SERIOUS DOWNSLOPING E-SE LOW
LEVEL FLOW INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS. OBSERVATION SITES IN
HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS SHOW WINDS AND GUSTS HAVE DECREASED...SO WILL
LET WIND ADVISORY EXPIRE AT 4PM EDT. MAY NEED TO CLOSELY WATCH SE
TN AND SW NC AREAS DUE TO PROXIMITY TO WARM FRONT INTO THE EARLY
EVENING HOURS...FOR POSSIBLE ISOLATED STRONG TO MARGINAL SEVERE
STORMS. 

OTHERWISE...ATTENTION TURNS TO SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT FOR MORE
SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IN THE FORM OF WINDY CONDITIONS AND SNOW
SHOWERS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE DEPARTING STRONG LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM. DECIDED TO ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY FOR SW VA/NE TN AND THE
MTN ZONES ALONG THE TN/NC STATELINE...RUNNING FROM 11 AM EDT SUN
THRU 11 AM EDT MON.

NOT CONFIDENT ON ACCUMULATING SNOWS FOR LOWER ELEVATIONS SUNDAY
AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY NIGHT...ALTHO MOISTURE IS CERTAINLY AVAILABLE
WITH STRONG LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW. FOR NOW...INCREASED SNOW
AMOUNTS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS THAT TYPICALLY EXPERIENCE SNOW
UNDER THESE CONDITIONS...ENDING UP WITH A 1 TO 3 INCH SNOWFALL 
MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FEET ACROSS SW VA/NE TN INCLUDING THE SMOKIES.
WILL NOT ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY YET (MAINLY 3RD PERIOD EVENT)...BUT
WILL ISSUE ANOTHER SPS. THESE SNOW AMOUNTS ARE CONSISTENT WITH WWD
GRAPHICS AND GRIDS FROM NEIGHBORING OFFICES.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LOW INCHES
SLOWLY EAST INTO THE ATLANTIC DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE WORK
WEEK KEEPING COLD AIR ADVECTION GOING AS NORTHERLY FLOW CONTINUES
ON BACK SIDE OF FEATURE. FORECAST REMAINS DRY TUESDAY AND UNSETTLED
WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY AS A COUPLE OF DISTURBANCES MAKE THEIR WAY

944 AM EDT SAT APR 14 2007

.DISCUSSION...AREA RADAR VAD WIND PROFILES PROVIDING USEFUL 
INFORMATION THIS MORNING ON TWO FEATURES...1) DOWNSLOPE FLOW INTO 
CENTRAL AND NRN PARTS OF THE TN VALLEY AS KGSP/KMRX/KFCX HAVE E-SE 
FLOW AT THE LOWEST LEVELS WHICH SHIFTS TO S-SW BY 4 TO 5 THOUSAND 
FEET AGL...AND 2) STRENGTH OF LOW LEVEL JET WITH KOHX SHOWING A 50 
TO 60 KNOT JET OVER MIDDLE TN (AROUND 30 TO 40 KNOTS OVER E TN).

THE DOWNSLOPE FLOW HAS REALLY HINDERED OUR RAINFALL POTENTIAL FOR 
EARLY TODAY...BUT RADAR LOOPS DO SHOW GOOD COVERAGE OF SHOWERS 
HEADED OUR WAY FROM MUCH OF KY...MIDDLE TN AND NRN AL. THE THREAT OF 
FLOODING RAINS DOES LOOK GREATLY DIMINISHED GIVEN THE STRONGER 
CONVECTION WELL TO OUR SOUTH OVER CENTRAL AND SRN MISSISSIPPI...
PLUS THE FACT THAT A FAIRLY WELL DEFINED BACK EDGE OF MAIN PCPN AREA 
HAS ALREADY CLEARED W TN.

NAM-WRF SEEMED TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON THE LOW LEVEL JET OVER 
MIDDLE TN WHICH IS PROGGED TO WEAKEN TO AROUND 40 KNOTS OVER E TN 
THIS AFTERNOON...THEN SHIFT WELL TO OUR EAST BY THIS EVENING. HAVE 
NOTICED INCREASING WINDS FROM OBSERVATION SITES ABOVE 2500 FEET.
THUS...WIND ADVISORY ISSUED EARLIER WILL BE ALLOWED TO CONTINUE AS 
ADVERTISED THROUGH 4PM EDT TODAY.

FOR THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE...WILL FOCUS A GOOD DEAL OF ATTENTION ON 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH COLD AIR 
ADVECTION AND UPSLOPE LOW LEVEL WINDS GENERATING A THREAT OF SOME 
LIGHT SNOWFALL FOR HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA...NE TN AND SMOKIES.

256 AM EDT SAT APR 14 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER NORTHERN LOUISIANA...WITH A WEST-TO- 
EAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT EXTENDING ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. MODELS ARE 
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE NORTHEASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM 
TODAY...WITH THE CENTER OF THE LOW PROGGED TO MOVE OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE BULK OF THE RAINFALL 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM SHOULD DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE LOW PRESSURE 
CENTER...ALONG AN INVERTED TROUGH WHICH WILL DEVELOP NORTH OF THE 
LOW ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. BOTH MODELS INDICATE A STRONG LOW- 
LEVEL SOUTHERLY 850 MB JET...ALONG WITH STRONG UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS 
AND LIFT AS DIFLUENCE ALOFT STRENGTHENS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. AS 
A RESULT...IT APPEARS THAT A WIDESPREAD BENEFICIAL RAINFALL WILL 
DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH THE HIGHEST RAINFALL 
TOTALS LIKELY TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST 
TN AND SOUTHWEST NC. BECAUSE OF THE EXTENDED DROUGHT CONDITIONS... 
FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES ARE HIGH FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHEAST TN. IN ADDITION...CONVECTION OVER 
THE LOWER MS VALLEY APPEARS TO BE STRENGTHENING SOUTH OF THE TN 
BORDER...AND THINK THAT THIS CONVECTION MAY LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE THAT CAN BE ADVECTED NORTH INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY. 
SOUNDINGS ALSO REVEAL A STABLE AIR MASS OVERALL FOR THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH NOT MUCH ELEVATED INSTABILITY. THUS...WHILE STRONG 
UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS SHOULD BE ABLE TO PRODUCE SOME THUNDER ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...THINK THAT SHORT-TERM CONVECTIVE RAINFALL 
WILL NOT BE A SIGNIFICANT PROBLEM TODAY...ALTHOUGH THE LONG-TERM 
RAINFALL TOTALS WILL BE HIGH (AROUND ONE TO TWO INCHES OVERALL...WITH 
LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS UP TO FOUR INCHES). FOR ALL OF THESE 
REASONS...WILL NOT ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR TODAY...BUT WILL CONTINUE 
THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL. IN ADDITION...WILL MENTION LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL 
POSSIBLE IN THE ZONES. BOTH THE WRF AND GFS MODELS INDICATE A 
STRONG 850 MB JET AROUND 50 TO 60 KNOTS TODAY...SO WILL CONTINUE THE 
WIND ADVISORY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN 
TO RAISE MAXES A LITTLE ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON...TO ACCOUNT FOR SOME POSSIBLE ADIABATIC WARMING FROM 
THE SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS DESCENDING DOWN THE MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...TROUGH AXIS OF HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
UPPER TROUGH WILL SWING THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON 
SUNDAY. COLDER AIR AND UPSLOPE FLOW WILL INDUCE SNOW SHOWERS IN
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BY LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. DRYING TREND
WITH MODERATING TEMPS IN THE OFFING BY EARLY WORK WEEK AS UPPER
TROUGH PULLS AWAY AND UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST ALLOWING
SIGNIFICANT HEIGHT RISES. MID-WEEK SYSTEM NOW LOOKS RATHER
DISORGANIZED CASTING SOME DOUBT ON SIGNIFICANCE OF THIS SYSTEM.
CONTINUED LOW POPS FOR CONSISTENCY SAKE. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS
GUIDANCE FAIRLY CLOSELY FOR TEMPS WHICH SHOULD APPROACH CLIMO BY
LATE IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
957 PM EDT FRI APR 13 2007

.DISCUSSION...A VERY DYNAMIC STORM SYSTEM DEVELOPING ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS THIS EVENING WITH A FAIRLY DEEP UPPER TROUGH.
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING AT 700MB ACROSS KENTUCKY EXTENDING INTO THE
FORECAST AREA IS RESPONSIBLE FOR PRODUCING A BAND OF LIGHT RAIN
OVER NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHERN VIRGINIA.

LATEST NAM AND GFS SHOW INCREASING BOUNDARY LAYER JET...CURRENTLY
OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA
AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE INCREASING 850MB JET (NEARING 50 KNOTS SATURDAY
MORNING) WILL INCREASE THE ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE REGION TOWARD
AFTER MIDNIGHT/TOWARD DAYBREAK. ALSO...GFS SHOW QUITE STRONG UPPER
LEVEL DIFLUENCE MOVING INTO THE REGION AS WELL. CONVECTION OVER THE
WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL LIKELY MOVE INTO THE CENTRAL AND
SOUTHERN AREAS OF THE FORECAST BY DAYBREAK EVEN THOUGH INSTABILITY
IS LIMITED. STRONG KINEMATIC FORCING WILL HELP OVER COME LACK OF INSTABILITY.
HAVE INCLUDED THUNDERSTORMS OVER MOST OF THE AREA SATURDAY
MORNING...EXCEPT FOR THE NORTHEAST SECTIONS.

DUE TO THE INCREASING 850MB JET...HAVE ALSO ISSUED A WINDY ADVISORY
FOR THE HIGHER EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST
NORTH CAROLINA FOR MOST OF THE DAY SATURDAY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
321 PM EDT FRI APR 13 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...PRECIPITATION HAS BEEN VERY 
PATCHY AND UNORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON...WITH AN OCCASIONAL 0.01 INCH 
NOTED ON ASOS. EXPECT THIS PATTERN TO PERSIST THIS EVENING WITH WARM 
AIR ADVECTION/WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT PRODUCING MORE PATCHY LIGHT RAIN 
THAT MOVES EAST IN THE NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. LOW PRESSURE MOVING 
INTO LOWER MISS VALLEY REGION TOWARD MORNING SHOULD EVENTUALLY 
SPREAD A SOLID AREA OF CONVECTIVE PCPN INTO WESTERN PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...THUS TRENDED INTO PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS TOWARD 
MORNING. 

CONTINUED CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT 
THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS SHOULD BE MAINLY TO OUR SOUTH WHERE BEST 
INSTABILITY WILL OCCUR. SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE SURFACE BASED AND ELEVATED 
OVER SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT NOT SO FOR SW VA AND 
NE TN (WHERE WORDED AS JUST A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS). AMOUNT OF 
RAINFALL FROM THIS SYSTEM IS A CONCERN...WITH OUR AREA NOW INCLUDED 
IN THE SLIGHT RISK OF EXCEEDING FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE. I WILL LIKELY 
ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT AND HIGHLIGHT SOME SIGNIFICANT 
RAIN FROM SATURDAY MORNING INTO SUNDAY MORNING...BUT NOT CONFIDENT 
ENOUGH THAT A FLOOD WATCH IS WARRANTED YET. MAIN REASONS ARE THAT 
SUCH STRONG TO SEVERE CONVECTION OVER THE GULF COAST STATES MAY 
INHIBIT RAIN AMOUNTS THIS FAR NORTH...PLUS A BRIEF PERIOD OF SE LOW 
LEVEL WINDS SATURDAY THAT WOULD PRODUCE DOWNSLOPE EFFECT. 

WILL ALSO MENTION THE MOISTURE AND MUCH COOLER AIR ON BACKSIDE OF 
SYSTEM FOR SUNDAY...WHICH MAY LEAD TO SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS AS EARLY AS SUNDAY AFTERNOON...THEN POSSIBLY FOR LOWER 
ELEVATIONS OF NORTHERN AREAS SUNDAY NIGHT.

GFS MODEL SEEMED TO HANDLE SYSTEM WELL...AND ITS MOS TEMPS WERE 
REASONABLE ESPECIALLY FOR MAX TEMPS EACH DAY...THUS CLOSELY 
FOLLOWED.  


.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DEEP UPPER TROF/UPPER LOW 
DROPS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND DRIVES STEADILY 
EAST THROUGH SOUTHERN NEW ENGLAND BY MID WEEK. POTENT STORM SYSTEM 
HAS MORE THAN ENOUGH WRAP AROUND MOISTURE AND DYNAMIC LIFT WITH VORT 
ENERGY ROTATING AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF SYSTEM TO KEEP PRECIP GOING 
WELL SUNDAY NIGHT AND SOME CONTINUATION ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THROUGH MID DAY MONDAY. WINTER TYPE WEATHER 
IS NOT OVER YET AS THIS SYSTEM WILL PULL SUBFREEZING AIR INTO THE 
REGION ALLOWING FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SNOW SHOWERS MAINLY ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND HIGHER TERRAIN NEAR THE NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER. FORECAST AREA DRIES OUT MONDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH DAYTIME 
PERIOD TUESDAY. MAINTAINED THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY DAYTIME PERIOD AS AN UNSETTLED PATTERN STILL IN THE 
WORKS FOR MID TO LATE WEEK AS MODELS SHOW A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORTWAVE TRAVERSING THE EASTERN STATES. SOME UNCERTAINTY AS 
TO HOW MUCH LIFT WITH MAIN SURFACE WAVE TRACKING ALONG THE GULF 
COAST SO KEPT POPS QUITE LOW FOR NOW. USED A DRY FORECAST FOR FRIDAY 
AWAITING NEXT UPPER TROF DUE OVER THE WEEKEND.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1002 AM EDT FRI APR 13 2007

.DISCUSSION...GFS MODEL DOING THE BEST JOB WITH THE LIGHT 
PRECIPITATION (PCPN) MOVING QUICKLY EAST ACROSS TN AND NRN AL THIS 
MORNING. THIS PCPN IS LIKELY NOT REACHING THE SURFACE IN MANY AREAS 
AND THE INTENSITY OF RETURNS IS LIKELY OVERDONE DUE TO BRIGHT 
BANDING ASSOCIATED WITH MELTING LEVEL. 850 MB ANALYSIS USING GFS 
DATA DOES REVEAL FRONTOGENESIS ALIGNED VERY WELL WITH CURRENT RADAR 
ECHOES. THIS FORCING/LIFT IS PROGGED TO MAINLY LIFT NORTH OF OUR 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT POSSIBLY STILL CLIPPING SW VA 
AREAS. CLOUDS HAVE INCREASED RAPIDLY THIS MORNING. WILL REMOVE THE 
AFTERNOON WORDING ON POPS...AND ALSO CONSIDER SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS
ALTHO RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD STAY ON THE ORDER OF TRACE TO A FEW 
HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH.

FOR THE WEEKEND...THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS SEEMS VERY LOW AT THIS 
POINT...AND TOTAL QPF OVER THE WEEKEND MAY BE DIMINISHED BY 
DOWNSLOPE FLOW INITIALLY AND THE FACT THAT SUCH STRONG CONVECTION 
WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES (AND THEREFORE REDUCE 
MOISTURE INFLOW TO OUR REGION). COLD AIR AND POTENTIAL FOR AT LEAST 
LIGHT SNOW LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...WHICH WILL BE LOOKED MORE INTO 
WITH THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

WILL UPDATE ZFPMRX SHORTLY AND ALSO FRESHEN GRIDS AND WEB PRODUCTS 
AS NEEDED.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
253 AM EDT FRI APR 13 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY... 
WITH A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER NEW MEXICO. HIGH CLOUDS 
SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...FROM THIS 
DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. WRF MODEL 
INDICATES SOME FRONTOGENETICAL FORCING DEVELOPING ACROSS SOUTHEAST 
TN THIS AFTERNOON...AS SOUTHERLY 850 MB WINDS CREATE AN UPPER-LEVEL 
WARM FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE SURFACE WARM FRONT SHOULD 
REMAIN SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH TONIGHT...BUT WILL ADD A 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AS THE UPPER- 
LEVEL WARM FRONT MOVES NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE WRF AND 
GFS MODELS INDICATE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE BULK OF THE 
PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AS IT MOVES EAST 
ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH TONIGHT. WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS 
FORECASTS TREND...WHICH IS SIMILAR TO THE FASTER GFS SOLUTION. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TODAY...BUT 
SLIGHTLY WARMER TONIGHT DUE TO THE EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER EXPECTED.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER FLOW REMAINS QUITE 
AMPLIFIED THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. MAJOR SYSTEM AFFECTS 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION REGION ON SATURDAY. STILL SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BETWEEN WRF...GFS AND SREF...BUT APPEARS EVENT
WILL BE CENTERED AROUND 00Z SUNDAY. SIGNIFICANT QPFS ALSO SEEM
PROBABLE ALTHOUGH WAS SOMEWHAT CONSERVATIVE WITH QPFS.
NEVERTHELESS...APPEARS THAT RAINFALL MAY APPROACH AN INCH OR MORE
GENERALLY OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE WHOLE EVENT. SEVERE
WEATHER NOT A GREAT CONCERN AT THIS TIME AS FORECAST SOUNDINGS
INDICATE A FAIRLY STABLE PROFILE. DID INCLUDE CHANCE THUNDER
HOWEVER AS DYNAMICS MAY BE STRONG ENOUGH TO OVERCOME LACK OF
INSTABILITY. MUCH COLDER AIR FOLLOWS DEPARTING SYSTEM ON SUNDAY
WITH ENOUGH WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE TO KEEP SCATTERED PRECIP AROUND.
SOME PRECIP MAY CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS
OF THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES SUNDAY NIGHT.

A DRY PERIOD WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE WORK WEEK 
BEFORE ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHES EARLY WEDNESDAY. THIS SYSTEM DOES 
NOT APPEAR TO BE AS SIGNIFICANT AS THIS WEEKENDS SYSTEM IN TERMS OF 
WIDESPREAD SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AT THIS TIME. TEMPS WILL MODERATE 
FROM WELL BELOW CLIMO ON SUNDAY TO NEAR CLIMO BY LATE IN THE LONG 
TERM PERIOD. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE CLOSELY FOR TEMPS.

GUSTS FROM OBSERVATION SITES...ESPECIALLY ABOVE 2500 FEET...THUS
WILL LET LAKE WIND AND WIND ADVISORIES RUN THE COURSE UNTIL 6PM EDT
(5PM CDT). HOWEVER...SINCE THESE PERIODS ARE MAINLY THE REST OF THE
AFTERNOON...I DID NOT PLAY UP WINDS MUCH IN TONIGHTS FORECAST.
EXPECTING WINDS TO STAY UP ENOUGH TO INHIBIT ANY FROST FORMATION...
BUT MAY ISSUE A SHORT SPS FOR MY SMOKY AND NRN TN MTN GROUPS WHERE
TEMPS MAY DIP BELOW FREEZING FOR AN HOUR OR TWO TOWARD MORNING.
WINDS AND PATCHY CLOUDS OVER THE NORTH FAVORED GOING ABOUT A DEGREE
ABOVE GFS MOS MINS.

OTHERWISE...FRIDAY LOOKS MOSTLY DRY...BUT LOW POPS WERE CARRIED
FROM NW AREAS DOWN TO NO POP NEAR GSP AREAS...FOR CONTINUITY AND TO
MATCH NEIGHBORS FORECAST GRIDS. WARM FRONT DEVELOPING SEEMS TO BE
THE FEATURE THAT GFS KEYS ON DEVELOPING WIDESPREAD LIGHT QPF. THIS
MAY BE OVERDONE...IF SO SIGNIFICANT SHOWERS MAY HOLD OFF UNTIL
EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS ON SATURDAY DOES
NOT APPEAR TOO GREAT AT THIS POINT...AS SURFACE LOW TRACKS MOSTLY
ALONG THE GULF COAST STATES.

FAVORED WARMER THAN MOS TEMPS FOR HIGHS FRIDAY DUE TO SOME WARM AIR
ADVECTION LATE IN THE AFTERNOON...AND ALSO AFTER SEEING MAX TEMPS
WARMER THAN MOS FOR TODAY. MINS FRIDAY NIGHT WOULD APPEAR TO BE
MUCH MILDER THAN 12/12Z MOS NUMBERS CAME IN...ALTHO FAR NE AREAS
MIGHT BE IN THE 40S. THUS...I BLENDED MORE WITH THE MUCH MILDER
MINS THAT WERE IN THE PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID FOR FRI NIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...ACTIVE WEATHER 
PATTERN TRANSITIONS FROM THUNDER THREAT EARLY SATURDAY NIGHT TO RAIN 
SHOWERS AND THEN A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS AS UPPER TROF 
INTENSIFIES OVER THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEASTERN STATES.  
POLAR AIRMASS WILL BE YANKED BACK INTO THE REGION ON THE BACK SIDE 
OF UPPER TROF FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE NEW WEEK WITH TEMPERATURES 
AROUND 15 TO NEARLY 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL AGAIN. SOME MODERATION 
OCCURS TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY BUT TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE BELOW 
NORMAL BY SEVERAL DEGREES. IT WILL ALSO BE AN UNSETTLED PERIOD AS AN

CONTINUES TO MOVE EAST AT 25 TO 30 MPH.  LATEST IR SATELLITE PICS 
SHOW SOME WARMING OF TOPS OVER SRN HALF OF MIDDLE TN...AND BEST 
SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY REMAINS TO OUR WEST FROM NRN MS INTO W TN 
AND NE AL.  HOWEVER...MODIFIED OHX 12Z SOUNDING AND FORECAST DATA 
FROM NAM-WRF MODEL SHOW ELEVATED INSTABILITY TO KEEP THUNDERSTORMS 
GOING INTO THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING HOURS.

INCREASING WINDS ALOFT AND A TIGHTENING SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT 
SUPPORT WIND AND LAKE WIND ADVISORY POSTED FROM NOON TO 6PM TODAY.
WILL NEED TO WATCH APPROACHING STORMS FOR AT LEAST POTENTIAL TO 
BECOME STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.
IF WE CAN GET BREAKS IN CLOUD COVER...LIKE CURRENTLY OVER W TN...
THEN POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE WOULD BE ENHANCED.

OTHERWISE...FORECAST AND GRIDS APPEAR TO BE VERY MUCH ON TRACK THIS

.SHORT-TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NEGATIVELY TILTED UPPER TROUGH
WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY TODAY INTO
TONIGHT. A 110+ KNOT JET AT 300MB WILL MOVE FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS
TOWARD THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEY WILL PRODUCE STRONG DIFFLUENT FLOW
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY LATER TODAY. THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE ON THE 
SOUTHERN FRINGE OF THE DIFLUENT FLOW ALOFT. STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER 
JET WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TODAY WITH 850 MB JET OF 45 TO 
50 KNOTS. I AM CONCERNED THAT A LITTLE MORE BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS 
TODAY DUE TO DOWNSLOPE FLOW INTO THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY 
WILL ALLOW THE STRONG WINDS TO MIX DOWN INTO THE VALLEY. WILL ISSUE 
A WIND ADVISORY AREA-WIDE...EVEN THOUGH THE STRONGEST WINDS WILL BE 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

AS FOR RAIN AND THUNDER CHANCES...NAM AND RUC MODELS SHOW STRONG 
BOUNDARY LAYER JET PULLING IN LOWER AND MID 50S DEWPOINTS INTO THE 
REGION THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING IN ADVANCE OF COLD FRONT. 
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH BREAKS OCCUR TODAY...ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO 
PRODUCE SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS. ALSO EXPECT MODERATELY STRONG 
ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE AREA AS WELL. WILL MAINTAIN CAT POPS 
AREA-WIDE.

PRECIPITATION WILL COME TO AN END SOON AFTER FROPA THIS EVENING WITH 
COOLER AIR RETURNING TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN
FROM THE NW THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. PRESSURE GRADIENT REMAINS TIGHT 
BETWEEN DEPARTING LOW AND BUILDING PRESSURE SO THURSDAY WILL BE 
BREEZY. TEMPS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. ACTIVE PATTERN 
SETTING UP FOR THE WEEKEND. MODEL UNCERTAINTY DEPICTED AS 4-CORNERS
CUTOFF LOW FLIRTS WITH PHASING WITH A NORTHERN SHORT. BEST BET IS

930 PM EDT TUE APR 10 2007

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING 
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. AREA RADARS INDICATE SOME LIGHT RAIN OVER 
ALABAMA ASSOCIATED WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF A WARM FRONT OVER 
THE GULF COASTAL REGION. THIS AREA OF RAIN SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY 
MOVE NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT...AND WILL PLAN TO RAISE POPS SOME FOR 
TONIGHT. SOUNDINGS REVEAL THAT A DRY AIR MASS REMAINS IN PLACE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...SO IT SHOULD TAKE AWHILE FOR 
THE DRY BOUNDARY LAYER TO MOISTEN UP FOR MUCH MEASURABLE RAIN. AS A 
RESULT...EXPECT ONLY LIGHT RAIN BEFORE SUNRISE WITH AMOUNTS LESS 
THAN A TENTH OF AN INCH. TEMPS FOR TONIGHT LOOK TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
NOTICED THAT MODELS INDICATE A FAVORABLE SCENARIO TOMORROW FOR 
DOWNSLOPE WINDS ALONG THE WESTERN SLOPES OF THE APPALACHIAN 
MOUNTAINS. SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST WINDS ALONG WITH A DECENT LOW-LEVEL 
INVERSION EXTENDING ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN RIDGES SHOULD COMBINE TO 
PRODUCE SOME ADIABATIC WARMING IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY 
AREAS. AS A RESULT...WILL PLAN TO RAISE MAX TEMPS FOR TOMORROW AT 
KNOXVILLE AND TRI-CITIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...
NO MORE FREEZING TEMPS TO WORRY ABOUT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM...BUT 
NOW FOCUS CENTERS ON TIMING POPS ASSOCIATED WITH APPROACHING SYSTEM. 
MODELS ARE GENERALLY SLIGHTLY SLOWER WITH ONSET OF PRECIP THAN 
PREVIOUS RUN...PROJECTING ONLY LOW POPS FOR THE FIRST PERIOD IN MOST 
AREAS. APPEARS THE GREATEST CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL OCCUR IN THE 18Z 
WED TO 00Z THU TIME FRAME FOR MOST AREAS. GENERALLY FAVORED TIMING 
OF SREF. ALSO APPEARS PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS WILL GENERALLY BE FAIRLY 
LIGHT...WITH QPF GENERALLY AROUND 0.5 INCHES EXPECTED. PRECIP 
SHOULD EXIT THE AREA BY 12Z THURSDAY AS UPPER TROUGH PULLS AWAY. FOR 
TEMPS...WENT SLIGHTLY ABOVE GFS GUIDANCE IN THE FIRST PERIOD WITH 
THE EXCEPTION OF THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES WHERE A DELAY IN ARRIVAL OF 
CLOUDS MAY ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP NEAR GUIDANCE. GFS GUIDANCE APPEARS 
REASONABLE FOR THE SECOND AND THIRD PERIODS AND WAS FOLLOWED CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...PROVIDING DRY 
WEATHER WITH A WARMING TREND. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE 60S ON 
THURSDAY...AND INTO THE 70S IN MOST SPOTS ON FRIDAY. AS THE RIDGE 
MOVES EAST FRIDAY NIGHT...A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW WITH ACCESS 
TO THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL ADVECT MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. MIDLEVEL 
NEGATIVE THETA-E ADVECTION OVER WARM MOIST SURFACE AIR WILL LEAD TO 
UNSTABLE CONDITIONS ON SATURDAY. THIS COMBINED WITH GOOD UPPER 
DIVERGENCE AND A 50 KT LOW LEVEL JET WILL LEAD TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS ON SATURDAY...WITH A POTENTIAL FOR SOME SEVERE 
STORMS. FROPA IN THE GFS IS AFTER 00Z SUNDAY...WITH SOME MOISTURE 
WRAPPING AROUND THE CLOSED LOW OVER LAKE ERIE ON SUNDAY. WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS IN THE NORTH INTO SUNDAY. THE AIRMASS BEHIND THE 
DEPARTING LOW IS NOT TERRIBLY COLD...AND OVERNIGHT LOWS SHOULD 
REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING SUNDAY NIGHT. A REX BLOCK PATTERN OVER THE 
WESTERN CONUS WILL KEEP A PERSISTENT DRY PATTERN THROUGH TUESDAY 
WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

30S. THE N PLATEAU AND E TN CENTRAL VALLEY HAVE A RANGE OF TEMPS IN 
THE 30S BUT SOME AREAS CONTINUE TO FLIRT WITH A FREEZE. SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO MOVE TO THE EAST TODAY. A SHORT WAVE WILL 
MOVE EAST INTO THE AREA TODAY. MAIN EFFECT TODAY WILL BE INCREASING 
AND LOWERING UPPER AND MIDDLE CLOUD DECKS. FAIRLY STRONG WAA GETS 
GOING LATE ESPECIALLY ACROSS S PART OF MRX CWA AS ELAVATED WARM 
FRONT WORKS ITS WAY DOWN. LOW LEVEL JET AND LAYER MOISTURE CONTINUE 
TO INCREASE TONIGHT AS WARM FRONT MOVES N THROUGH THE AREA. SHORT WAVE
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST LATE TONIGHT SETTING UP DIFFLUENT FLOW 
ALOFT. THESE FAVORABLE INGREDIANTS ARE NOT ACCOMPANIED BY VERY 
STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT OR MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES. DESPITE EVER 
CLIMBING POP CHC TOWARD MORNING...RAINFALL AMOUNTS SHOULD BE PALTRY. 
TODAY HIGHS WILL BE WARMER BUT CONTINUED BELOW NORMAL. TONIGHT MINS 
FALL LITTLE TO NEAR NORMAL.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL
MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS TO THE OHIO VALLEY-LOWER
GREAT LAKES WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. MODERATELY STRONG BOUNDARY
LAYER JET WILL PULL SOUTHERLY MOIST WINDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
FOR WEDNESDAY WITH DECENT ISENTROPIC LIFT. ALSO...LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH
LEFT FRONT QUAD (LEFT EXIT REGION) OF A 130 KNOT JET WILL MOVE ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF FROPA DURING THE EVENING.
WIDESPREAD RAIN IS ANTICIPATED AREA-WIDE WEDNESDAY. INSTABILITY
STAYS SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH ONLY A SMALL AREA OF CAPE NOTED
AT CHA DURING THE EARLY EVENING. WILL KEEP THUNDER OUT OF THE FORECAST
FOR NOW.

SOON AFTER FROPA WEDNESDAY NIGHT...DRIER AIR WILL DECREASE THE
CLOUDS FROM WEST TO EAST WITH SUNSHINE RETURNING AREA-WIDE FOR
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. UPPER RIDGE WILL RE-ESTABLISH ITSELF OVER THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY AHEAD OF THE NEXT STRONGER UPPER TROUGH. THICKNESS
AND 850MB TEMPERATURES WILL INCREASE WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES
ANTICIPATED FOR THE END OF THE WEEK.

FOR LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...NEXT UPPER TROUGH AND
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA. TIMING OF FROPA IS A
LITTLE SLOWER WITH THE ECMWF COMPARED TO THE GFS. NCEP IS TRENDING
TOWARD THE SLOWER SOLUTION WHICH WILL ALLOW MORE MOISTURE TO ADVECT
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. WILL NEED TO WATCH FOR THE POTENTIAL OF
SEVERE WEATHER SATURDAY AFTERNOON-EVENING AS THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY
AHEAD OF FROPA IS IN QUESTION.

FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...ANOTHER DEEP UPPER TROUGH SWINGS INTO THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MAIN ISSUES FOR THE SHORT TERM 
ARE TEMPS TONIGHT AND POPS TUESDAY. GFS GUIDANCE HAS BEEN RUNNING 
TOO COLD THE PAST SEVERAL NIGHTS. THUS...TEND TO DISREGARD COLDER 
GFS GUIDANCE FOR TONIGHT AND INSTEAD FAVOR WARMER NAM (MET) 
GUIDANCE. AT ANY RATE...NOT ANTICIPATING TEMPS TO BE ANY COLDER 
TONIGHT THAN LAST NIGHT AS WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES THROUGH THE AREA 
PRODUCING AT LEAST SCATTERED CLOUD COVER. WILL ISSUE ANOTHER FREEZE 
WARNING BUT ONLY FOR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA AS 
WELL AT THE NORTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES.

ON TUESDAY...SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST WILL SPREAD INCREASING 
CLOUD COVER INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. HOWEVER...ANY LIGHT 
RAINFALL WILL INITIALLY BE FALLING FROM A HIGH CLOUD DECK AND HAVE 
TO OVERCOME DRY LOWER LAYERS. BASED ON THESE FACTORS...FAVOR LOWER 
GFS GUIDANCE POPS IN THIS REGARD AS IT APPEARS ANY MEASURABLE 
PRECIP WILL NOT OCCUR UNTIL AFTER 00Z WED. FOR TEMPS ON 
TUESDAY...AGAIN FAVORED MET GUIDANCE AS ITS COOLER VALUES SEEM MORE 
REASONABLE BASED ON THE ANTICIPATED INCREASING CLOUD COVER AND 
POTENTIAL EVAPORATIVE COOLING FROM LIGHT RAIN FALLING INTO DRY 
LOWER LAYERS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...GFS HOLDS OFF NEXT 
SYSTEM UNTIL THE WEE HOURS OF WEDNESDAY. INSTABILITY STILL VERY LOW 
AS TEMPS COOL AND AIR DRY. THIS SYSTEM MUST OVERCOME VERY DRY AIR 
BEFORE ACTUALLY DROPPING ANY PRECIP ON THE GROUND. BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON POPS LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL MOST AREAS, BUT DROP OFF 
QUICKLY TO CHANCE AGAIN BY LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. WITH WARMING TREND 
IN BOTH MINS AND MAXES, ALL PRECIP WILL BE LIQUID. NEXT SHOT AT 
PRECIP WILL BE THURSDAY WITH SYSTEM IN NORTHERLY STREAM JUST 
BRUSHING OUR UPPER SECTIONS. THEN ANOTHER SHOT SATURDAY, BUT 
OBVIOUSLY THAT OUTLOOK CAN CHANGE BY THE NEXT SEVERAL MODEL RUNS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK LOW LEVEL RIDGE OVER MRX CWA 
THROUGH SHORT TERM. MID AND UPR JETS NEARLY ZONAL. UPR JET CORE 
REMAINS NORTH OF AREA. MID LEVEL JET STRENGTHENS ACROSS TN TODAY AND 
SHIFTS E TONIGHT. MID/UPR LEVEL MOISTURE ADVECTS ACROSS AREA EARLY 
TODAY MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHERN AREA. LAYER DRIES OUT THIS EVENING. 
SHORT WAVE APPROACHES FROM W LATE TONIGHT BUT SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE 
SHOULD REMAIN W OF AREA. TEMPERATURES MODERATED EARLY TODAY BUT 
SHOULD SEE ABOUT A 5 DEGREES WARM UP FROM SUNDAYS READINGS. GOOD 
RADIATION CONDITIONS EARLY TONIGHT. NAM/GFS MOS HAS BEEN 
CONSISTENTLY TOO COOL ON MINS SO MIN FCST ON THE HIGH SIDE. THIS 
DOES RESULT IN SOME FREEZING TEMPS ACROSS MRX CWA BUT CURRENT FREEZE 
EPISODE AND DURATION OF FREEZING TONIGHT SHOULD NOT REQUIRE AN 
ADDITIONAL FREEZE WARNING.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...TEMPERATURES SHOULD CONTINUE 
TO WARM LITTLE EACH DAY THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK AS THE COLD 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST.  A WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL TRACK 
JUST TO OUR SOUTH LATE IN THE DAY TUESDAY AND MAY GENERATE SOME 
ISOLATED SHOWERS FAR SOUTHERN ZONES.  THIS IS IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT 
WEATHER SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD REACH INTO THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT.  
SYSTEM APPEARS A BIT UNORGANIZED BUT WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND 
LIFT...ASSOCIATED PRECIP WILL SPREAD FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST 
OVERNIGHT WITH BEST CHANCE OF PRECIP LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY.  A FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER OVER OUR NORTHEASTERN AREAS 
INTO THURSDAY MORNING AS THE SYSTEM EXITS THE AREA.  A SHORT WAVE 
SLIDES THROUGH TO OUR NORTH ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...BUT 
SHOULD REMAIN DRY OVER OUR AREA.  THE NEXT SYSTEM REACHES INTO THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...SHORT WAVE ENERGY SLIDING BY TO 
OUR SOUTH EXPECTED TO BRING SOME HIGH AND MID CLOUDS LATTER HALF OF 
TONIGHT INTO TOMORROW.  BIG QUESTION IS HOW MUCH...AND WHAT WILL BE 
EFFECT ON TEMPS.  THINK AT LEAST SOUTHERN AREAS WILL BE BROKEN TO 
OVERCAST BY LATE TONIGHT...AND THESE CONDITIONS WILL LAST INTO  
MONDAY MORNING.  STILL MAY BE QUITE A FEW CLOUDS AROUND EVEN DURING 
THE AFTERNOON HOURS.  CAN NOT RULE OUT A SPRINKLE OR TWO ESPECIALLY 
SOUTH MONDAY...BUT LIFT LOOKS WEAK ENOUGH TO LEAVE FORECAST DRY FOR 
NOW.  WITH EXPECTED CLOUDS...WILL GENERALLY GO A BIT ABOVE GFS MOS 
TEMPS TONIGHT.  STILL SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR FREEZE WARNING...SO 
WILL LEAVE NPW AS IS.  SOME RECORDS LOWS IN DANGER AS 
WELL...ESPECIALLY AT CHA AND TRI. 


.LONG TERM...MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SLOW WARMING TREND 
STILL ON TRACK PER LATEST MODEL AND ENSEMBLE DATA. HOWEVER...APPEARS 
MONDAY NIGHT WILL STILL BE UNSEASONABLY COLD WITH TEMPS GENERALLY 
BELOW FREEZING ACROSS THE AREA. A WEAK UPPER WAVE WILL TRANSLATE  
THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT BUT MOISTURE IS LACKING AND LIFT WEAK 
TO NON-EXISTENT PER MODEL TIME-HEIGHTS. THUS NOT ANTICIPATING ANY 
PRECIP WITH THIS FEATURE AND SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT GFS GUIDANCE POPS. 
PRECIP CHANCES INCREASE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS NEXT SYSTEM 
APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. KEPT POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY HOWEVER 
AS FEATURE DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE PARTICULARLY WELL ORGANIZED. AFTER 
A BRIEF RESPITE ON FRIDAY...ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHES ON SATURDAY. 
THIS SYSTEM APPEARS BETTER ORGANIZED THAN THE WEDNESDAY SYSTEM. 
HOWEVER...TIMING UNCERTAINTIES PRECLUDE GOING WITH POPS ANY HIGHER 
THAT CHANCE AT THIS TIME. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED GFS ENSEMBLE 
MEAN GUIDANCE. TEMPS ARE PROJECTED TO MODERATE TO ABOVE CLIMO BY 
LATE WORK WEEK BEFORE ANOTHER COOLING TREND NEXT WEEKEND.

247 PM EDT THU APR 5 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER CENTRAL 
CANADA...AND EXTENDING SOUTH OVER MOST OF THE UNITED STATES. THIS 
UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR MASS WILL CONTINUE TO FILTER INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA TONIGHT WITH NORTHWEST WINDS. IN FACT...RECORD LOWS COULD BE 
BROKEN TOMORROW MORNING ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA (EXCEPT 
SOUTHEAST TN). RECORDS LOWS FOR TOMORROW MORNING INCLUDE CHA (27)... 
TYS (29)...OQT (29) AND TRI (27). SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL THAT 
CLOUDS HAVE SCATTERED ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON...BUT HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD GRADUALLY INCREASE LATE TONIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE MIDDLE OF 
THE NATION. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL 
PRODUCE SOME LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA (INCLUDING THE SMOKIES). TEMPS WILL LIKELY BE TOO WARM 
IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS FOR MUCH SNOW...BUT THINK THAT A LIGHT 
DUSTING OF UP TO AN INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET. IT APPEARS THAT FREEZE WARNINGS WILL 
LIKELY HAVE TO BE ISSUED FOR SEVERAL CONSECUTIVE MORNINGS THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...DRY BUT USEASONABLY COOL
WEATHER REGIME EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE WEEKEND AND INTO
EARLY NEXT WEEK. NEXT SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM APPROACHES BY LATE
TUESDAY/EARLY WEDNESDAY PER MEDIUM RANGE MODEL AND ENSEMBLE
CONSENSUS...WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY PROJECTED BETWEEN 12Z
WEDNESDAY AND 06Z THURSDAY. HOWEVER...SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN
TIMING AND PLACEMENT OF SYSTEM DECREASES CONFIDENCE SOMEWHAT. FOR
TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE SINCE THERE WAS NO CLEAR
SIGNAL IN THE ENSEMBLE DATA TO SUGGEST OTHERWISE. WIDER-THAN-AVERAGE
SPREAD AMONG ENSEMBLE MEMBERS PRECLUDED MUCH HELP BY LATE IN THE
LONG TERM PERIOD HOWEVER.

257 AM EDT THU APR 5 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)... 
CURRENT TEMPERATURES ARE A COUPLE DEGREES ABOVE THE PREVIOUS
FORECAST...SO THE FREEZE AREA MAY NOT BE AS EXTENSIVE AS THE
CURRENT WARNING INDICATES...HOWEVER AT THIS POINT WILL LEAVE THE
WARNING AS IS. LOW CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH COLD ADVECTION WILL
AFFECT OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES THIS MORNING. HOWEVER THE LAYER OF
MOISTURE IS QUITE THIN PER 00Z BNA SOUNDING AND AREA ACARS
SOUNDINGS...SO THE CLOUDS WILL LIKELY BECOME SCATTERED WITH DAYTIME
MIXING. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL BE WEAKER TONIGHT...SO WITH
LIGHTER WINDS AND CONTINUED COLD ADVECTION THROUGH THE DAY...TEMPS
SHOULD DROP TO NEAR FREEZEING OR BELOW ACROSS THE AREA. WILL KEEP
THE FREEZE WATCH AS IS FOR TONIGHT...MAINLY TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH
TWO WARNINGS.

A CLIPPER DIVES SOUTHEAST OUT OF CENTRAL CANADA ON FRIDAY. POSITIVE
VORTICITY ADVECTION...UPPER DIFFLUENCE AT THE NOSE OF THE POLAR
JET...AND VERY COLD TEMPS ALOFT SHOULD PRODUCE SCATTERED SHOWERS IN
THE NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY
NIGHT. VERY STEEP LAPSE RATES AND AN UPSLOPE FLOW AROUND 30 KTS
WILL FAVOR MOUNTAIN LOCATIONS FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS. WILL LEAN MORE
TOWARD THE HIGHER POPS OF THE MAV VS. THE DRIER MET. A VERY COLD AIR
MASS BUILDS INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY BEHIND THE SYSTEM...AND LOWS
WILL LIKELY BREAK RECORDS OVER THE WEEKEND.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES CONTINUE THROUGH MONDAY AS A TROUGH
REMAINS OVER THE EAST COAST. A RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD ON
TUESDAY...RESULTING IN A WARMING TREND. ADVECTION OF LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE INTO THE AREA BEGINS TUESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF A CLOSED LOW
THAT FORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS IN FOR
WEDNESDAY WITH THIS SYSTEM.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

333 PM EDT WED APR 4 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...COLDER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO 
PUSH INTO THE REGION TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY.  BIG QUESTION IS HOW 
MUCH IN THE WAY OF LOW CLOUDS MAKE IT INTO OUR AREA.  RIGHT NOW 
EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE OVER NORTHERN AREAS TONIGHT...PERHAPS AS 
FAR SOUTH AS SOME CENTRAL ZONES.  EXPECT CLOUDS WILL RETREAT ONCE 
AGAIN DURING THE DAY TOMORROW. OTHER ISSUE IS FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES.  AFTER MAKING SOME CALLS...IT HAS BEEN DECIDED TO 
START THE FREEZE PROGRAM NOW INSTEAD OF WAITING FOR THE NORMAL 
CLIMATOLOGICALLY BASED DATES DUE TO THE RECENT EXTENDED PERIOD OF 
VERY WARM TEMPS AND HOW FAR ALONG VEGETATION IS AT THIS POINT.  
TEMPERATURES IN THE VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL PROBABLY NOT REACH 
CRITERIA TONIGHT...BUT TEMPERATURES OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
SHOULD DIP WELL INTO THE 20S.  WILL ISSUE FREEZE WARNING FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS AS WELL AS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE NORTHERN PLATEAU FOR 
TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...TROUGH WILL
CONTINUE ACROSS EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY THROUGH THE WEEKEND
WITH MUCH BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH EASTER. LOWS THURSDAY
NIGHT/FRIDAY MORNING SHOULD DROP BELOW FREEZING IN ALL AREAS AS
COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES WITH SURFACE HIGH DROPPING SOUTHEAST
FROM CANADA INTO NORTHERN PLAINS. HAVE ISSUED FREEZE WATCH FOR
THURSDAY NIGHT. RIDGING CONTINUES ACROSS THE WESTERN STATES WITH
SYSTEM MOVING OVER IT INTO THE CENTRAL US FRIDAY WITH MOISTURE
MOVING EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY. GFS DEEPENS TROUGH OVER THE EAST
LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY AND A SHORTWAVE MAY PRODUCE A LITTLE RAIN
AND SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY ACROSS THE NE SECTION OF THE FORECAST
AREA FRIDAY NIGHT. SKIES CLEAR AGAIN SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT
WITH LOWS STILL DROPPING INTO THE 20S WITH HARD FREEZES. PATTERN
FINALLY CHANGES EARLY NEXT WEEK AS TROUGH SHIFTS EAST AND UPPER
FLOW FLATTENS OUT. A SIGNIFICANT LOW DEVELOPS ACROSS THE CENTRAL US
BY MID WEEK INCREASING THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND PROBABLY THUNDERSTORMS.

COLD FRONT ADVANCING AT A RAPID PACE ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND NOW 
MOVING TOWARD THE WESTERN EDGE OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WITH SWATH 
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS STRETCHING FROM SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. RAIN WILL END 
ACROSS THE REGION EARLY THIS MORNING AS COOLER AND DRIER AIR FILLS 
IN BEHIND FRONT. UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING STRENGTHENS ACROSS MUCH OF 
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS SOUTH FROM CANADA INTO THE DEEP SOUTH. PLENTY OF 
COLD AIR ADVECTION TO SEND TEMPERATURES TUMBLING TO CHILLY 20 TO 25 
DEGREE BELOW NORMAL VALUES WITH THE COLDEST PERIOD FRIDAY THROUGH 
SUNDAY. THERE WILL EVEN BE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SNOW SHOWERS IN THE 
TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSSEE AND THE 
SMOKY MOUNTAINS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT AS A SHORT WAVE TROF ROUNDS 
THE BASE OF MASSIVE UPPER LEVEL TROF. TEMPERATURES REBOUND GRADUALLY

318 AM EDT TUE APR 3 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...
HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE SUBTROPICAL JET OVER THE TX COAST 
WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING. AS THE JET TRANSLATES EAST 
THERE SHOULD BE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE BY THE AFTERNOON...AND HIGHS 
SHOULD REACH THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S IN THE VALLEY. SURFACE 
DEWPOINTS BEGIN TO RISE WITH A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF 
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. EXPECT THAT 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP NEAR THE MS VALLEY IN THE AFTERNOON AND 
TRACK EAST...REACHING THE PLATEAU BY THE EVENING. UPPER DIVERGENCE 
BETWEEN THE SUBTROPICAL JET AND POLAR JET IS MAXIMIZED AROUND 03Z 
WHILE THE 850 MB JET INCREASES TO AROUND 40 KTS. ALTHOUGH THE BEST 
INSTABILITY WILL BE TO OUR WEST IN THE AFTERNOON...SBCAPE REMAINS 
NEAR 1000 J/KG IN THE EVENING...AND THE STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL JET 
PRODUCES 0-1 KM SHEAR AROUND 30 KTS. COMPOSITE PARAMETERS SUCH AS 
EHI AND SCP SUGGEST SUPERCELLS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE EVENING IN 
THE PLATEAU...WITH LARGE HAIL THE MOST LIKELY THREAT...AND AN 
ISOLATED TORNADO POSSIBLE. SPC HAS PLACED THE WESTERN HALF OF THE 
AREA IN A SLIGHT RISK...AND WILL ISSUE AN SPS FOR THAT AREA TO 
HIGHLIGHT THE THREAT OF SEVERE WEATHER. THE COLD FRONT MOVES QUICKLY 
THROUGH THE AREA BETWEEN 10Z AND 14Z...AND WILL END POPS ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE AREA BY 14Z WEDNESDAY. COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT WILL 
LIKELY PREVENT MUCH OF A RISE IN TEMPERATURES ON WEDNESDAY...WITH 
LOWS TUESDAY NIGHT IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S AND HIGHS WEDNESDAY IN 
THE LOWER TO MID 60S. WITH CLEAR SKIES...TEMPS WEDNESDAY NIGHT COULD 
FALL BELOW FREEZING...MAINLY IN THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER LOW MIGRATES STEADILY 
EAST THROUGH THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES INTO NEW ENGLAND THROUGH 12Z 
FRIDAY BUT THEN ITS PROGRESS COMES TO A HALT AND REMAINS IN THE 
VICINITY UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY TIME FRAME. THIS PROVIDES FOR 
PLENTY OF COLD AIR ADVECTION WITH MINOR SHORTWAVE FEATURES DROPPING 
SOUTH OUT OF CANADA. MUCH OF THE IMPACT ASSOCIATED WITH THESE WAVES 
APPEARS TO AFFECT MAINLY POINTS NORTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
INCLUDING THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS WHERE 
MOISTURE IS A LITTLE DEEPER. STAYED JUST BELOW 15 PERCENT POP DURING 
THIS PERIOD AWAITING LATER MODEL RUNS FOR BETTER FOCUS ON WEEKEND 
SITUATION. EDGED TEMPS DOWN A BIT ACCORDING TO NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE 
WHICH FEATURES TEMPS 15 TO 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO DOMINATE AREA WEATHER TONIGHT 
PROVIDING CLEAR SKIES AND MILD WEATHER.  A COLD FRONT WILL BE 
APPROACHING THE AREA ON TUESDAY.  WILL SEE CLOUDS INCREASE...BUT 
ASSOCIATED PRECIP SHOULD NOT REACH INTO THE AREA DURING THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS.   HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE WITH SOME LOW POPS 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO COVER ANY CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPS OUT AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...

FLATTENING UPPER RIDGE GOES ZONAL BY LATE TUESDAY NIGHT WITH COLD 
FRONT MOVING IN FROM NORTHWEST. GFS AND NAM APPEAR TO MOSTLY AGREE 
ON TIMING OF FROPA DURING THE WEE HOURS OF WEDNESDAY MORNING, BUT 
THEIR DEPICTIONS OF THE STRENGTH OF THE UVV ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
FRONT DIFFER DRAMATICALLY. THE GFS IS NOTICABLY WEAKER THAN THE NAM, 
WHICH ITSELF APPEAR WAY TOO STRONG. WILL THEREFORE GO WITH A BLEND 
OF THE TWO (LEANING MORE TOWARD THE NAM) ON THE STRENGTH OF THE 
SYSTEM, AND THE NAM ON TIMING.

THIS ALL MEANS THAT POPS WILL QUICKLY INCREASE TUESDAY EVENING INTO 
WEDNESDAY MORNING, WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THE CALL. HOWEVER, 
THE MAIN INSTABILITY (-8 LIS AND 352 SFC THETA E) REMAIN WAY BACK 
OUT WEST OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY AND EVEN AROUND THE ARKLATEX 
REGION. AS THE SYSTEM MOVES EAST, WE GET SOME DECREASE IN OUR 
STABILITY, BUT THETA ES ONLY RISE TO THE UPPER 320S. RH IS NOT 
THAT IMPRESSIVE, EITHER. WILL CONSEQUENTLY RAISE POPS FROM THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF TUESDAY AFTERNOON RAPIDLY TO LIKELIES TUESDAY 
EVENING AND NIGHT, AND RAMP QUICKLY DOWN AGAIN WEDNESDAY MORNING, TO 
BASICALLY NADA WED AFTN. AMOUNTS WILL VARY, BEING MOSTLY LIGHT, BUT 
SOME SPOTS UNDER THE STRAY THUNDERSTORM WILL GET MODERATE TO VERY 
BRIEF HEAVY RAIN. NO FLOODING EXPECTED, BUT WE SURE NEED THE RAIN.

LATER, AS THE COLD AIR ADVECTION MOVES IN BEHIND THE FRONT, 
THICKNESSES DROP TO 540 DM ACROSS THE NORTH HALF OF FORECAST AREA BY 
THURSDAY, COLD ENOUGH TO SNOW, THEORETICALLY. HOWEVER...BIG 
HOWEVER...RH IS BASEMENT DRY ALL DAY THURSDAY. IT DOES INCREASE A 
LITTLE FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY BUT UVV IS LIMITED. CAVEAT: DURING THIS 
TIME, THICKNESS VALUES DROP TO 530 AS FAR SOUTH AS THE GEORGIA LINE, 
WITH 519 IN SOUTHWEST VA. H5 TEMPS ARE ALSO IN THE -20S CELSIUS, SO 
WOULD NOT RULE OUT SOME FLURRIES OR EVEN SNOW SHOWERS UP NORTH, BUT 
THAT IS ON THE METEOROLOGICAL HORIZON AND AM NOT WILLING TO CLIMB 
OUT ON THAT LIMB JUST YET. WILL PASS THIS INFO ON TO SUCCESSORS FOR 
FURTHER CONSIDERATION.

230 PM EDT SUN APR 1 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS CONTINUES TO SHOW A WEAK COLD FRONT REMAINING WELL WEST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA...GENERALLY OVER THE LOWER OHIO AND MS RIVER 
VALLEYS ALONG A LOUISVILLE TO MEMPHIS LINE. A VERY MOIST AIR MASS 
REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS IN THE 60S. 
LOCAL RADARS REVEAL THAT MOST OF THIS MORNINGS CONVECTION HAS 
EXITED THE FORECAST AREA...WITH ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS LINGERING. GFS 
AND RUC MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE SOME SCATTERED CONVECTIVE 
REDEVELOPMENT LATER THIS AFTERNOON...AS THE LOCAL AIR MASS BECOMES 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE. IN FACT...LATEST MSAS DATA ALREADY REVEALS LIS 
OF -3 OVER SOUTHEAST TN. UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS APPEAR TO BE WEAK AS 
THE UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL. THUS...THINK THAT ANY CONVECTIVE 
REDEVELOPMENT WILL BE SCATTERED IN COVERAGE. MODELS ALSO INDICATE 
THE GREATEST AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY IN THE LOWER-LEVELS...ALONG WITH 
STRONG LOW-LEVEL HELICITY VALUES (100 TO 200 M2/S2). AS A 
RESULT...THINK THAT SOME SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE POSSIBLE LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...ALONG WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A FEW ISOLATED 
TORNADOES. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO WASH-OUT OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA LATER TONIGHT...WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS CONTINUING ON MONDAY. AS A 
RESULT...WENT WARMER THAN GUIDANCE WITH TEMPS TONIGHT AND MONDAY... 
AS DEWPOINTS SHOULD ALSO REMAIN HIGH ALONG WITH MORE SUNSHINE 
EXPECTED ON MONDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS REMAIN SOMEWHAT 
INCONSISTENT WITH TIMING OF INCOMING SYSTEM LATE TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH BEST CHANCE OF FRONTAL PASSAGE AND 
ASSOCIATED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY NIGHT. UPPER LOW LIFTS OUT 
AND POSITIONED ITSELF WELL TO OUR NORTH ON THURSDAY...AND A SHORT 
WAVE TRACKS THROUGH TO OUR SOUTH AROUND THE FRIDAY TIME FRAME. THESE 
DO HAVE THE POTENTIAL OF GENERATING SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS...BUT MAIN 
MOISTURE AND LIFT APPEAR TO STAY OUT OF OUR AREA AT THIS TIME AND 
WILL THEREFORE...CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST THURSDAY THROUGH 
SUNDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE LOWER OHIO 
AND MS RIVER VALLEYS...WITH A VERY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. CURRENT RADARS INDICATE A LARGE AREA OF RAIN WITH 
SOME EMBEDDED THUNDER OVER THE FORECAST AREA...AND THINK THIS AREA 
OF CONVECTION WILL SLOWLY EXIT THE FORECAST AREA BY EARLY AFTERNOON. 
WITH THE COLD FRONT REMAINING WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON...THINK THAT SCATTERED CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT WILL OCCUR 
BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE 
IMAGERY ALSO REVEALS A WELL-DEFINED MID-LEVEL DRY SLOT OVER WESTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WHICH THE MODELS SUGGEST WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATER THIS AFTERNOON. AS A RESULT...A 
MARGINALLY (TO POSSIBLY MODERATELY) UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS FRONT OVER THE FORECAST AREA...PARTICULARLY IN 
THE LOWER LEVELS. IN ADDITION TO THIS LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY...MODELS 
INDICATE ALOT OF LOW-LEVEL HELICITY THIS AFTERNOON (UP TO 200 
M2/S2)...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN. AS A RESULT...THINK THAT 
SOME ISOLATED TORNADOES MAY BE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...AND HAVE UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO MENTION 
THIS POSSIBILITY. 

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE TO 
REMOVE MORNING WORDING...AND TO RAISE TEMPS A LITTLE TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE SOLAR WARMING WITH SOME CLOUD BREAKS 
EXPECTED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS BEEN 
INCREASING OVER MIDDLE TN OVER THE PAST FEW HOURS...ASSOCIATED WITH 
WEAK SURFACE CONFLUENCE UNDER A MID LEVEL FRONT. WILL HAVE 
CATEGORICAL POPS THIS MORNING WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE SPLIT FRONT. 
WITH MARGINAL ELEVATED INSTABILITY...ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
REMAIN A POSSIBILITY THIS MORNING. RAIN CHANCES WILL DECREASE BY THE 
AFTERNOON AS MID LEVEL DRYING ENSUES BEHIND THE MID LEVEL 
FRONT...HOWEVER WITH THE SURFACE FRONT LAGGING WELL BEHIND AND 
PERHAPS A LITTLE SURFACE HEATING...THE INSTABILITY INCREASES THIS 
AFTERNOON. THUS EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO REDEVELOP THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH BEST CHANCES IN THE SOUTH WHERE INSTABILITY WILL BE 
A LITTLE HIGHER...BUT COVERAGE SHOULD REMAIN SCATTERED AS THE 
SYNOPTIC SCALE FORCING WILL BE WEAK. POPS LOWER TO A SLIGHT CHANCE 
IN THE EVENING...AND END AFTER MIDNIGHT. WITH THE FRONT REMAINING TO 
OUR WEST...BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE SHOULD BE PLENTIFUL...SO EXPECT A 
LOW STRATUS DECK TO FORM OVERNIGHT. 
...

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...FRONT PUSHING EAST OF THE 
AREA ON MONDAY.  NAM INDICATING SOME MOISTURE LINGERING INTO 
MONDAY...WILL FOLLOW GFS AND KEEP MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT DRY.  
ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA LATE TUESDAY.  DECENT MOISTURE AND 
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH IT...ALONG WITH SOME INSTABILITY. WILL CONTINUE 
WITH 20 POPS FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT.  STILL PRETTY GOOD DYNAMICS WITH THE FRONT AS IT TRACKS 
THROUGH ON TUESDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP THE 50 POPS ON TUESDAY NIGHT.  
FRONT PUSHING EAST ON WEDNESDAY...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR THE 
MORNING HOURS...DRY WEATHER RETURNS WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  AN UPPER LOW 
TRACKS TO THE NORTH OF THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY... 
BEST MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR 
THURSDAY.  GFS SHOWING A SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE AREA ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...BEST MOISTURE TO THE SOUTH OF OUR AREA 
SO WILL KEEP FRIDAY DRY.  ANOTHER SHORTWAVE APPROACHING THE REGION 
ON SATURDAY...BEST MOISTURE STAYS TO THE WEST SO WILL KEEP SATURDAY  
DRY TOO.  COOLER WEATHER IS EXPECTED ON THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH A COLD FRONT OVER THE OZARK AND ARKLATEX REGION. 
CURRENT LOCAL RADARS ARE DEVOID OF ANY CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT WILL MAINTAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE POP AROUND 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DUE TO THE LOCAL AIR MASS BECOMING SLIGHTLY 
UNSTABLE. WRF AND GFS MODELS SEEM TO BE COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT 
WITH A SLOWER EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS COLD FRONT TONIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY. BOTH MODELS SHOW THE COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING TIME FRAME ON 
SUNDAY. IT STILL APPEARS THAT STRONG CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OVER THE 
WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS EVENING...WILL WEAKEN 
AS IT MOVES EAST TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. 
ONLY WEAK INSTABILITY IS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA...SO DONT THINK THERE WILL BE MUCH OF A SEVERE TSTORM THREAT 
OVERNIGHT. THE HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA APPEAR 
TO BE DURING THE MORNING HOURS AROUND SUNRISE...WITH SOME SCATTERED 
CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT EXPECTED ALONG THE COLD FRONT IN THE LATE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. WRF AND GFS MODELS HAVE SOME 
DISAGREEMENT WITH THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE AVAILABLE IN THE AFTERNOON 
FOR REDEVELOPMENT ALONG THE COLD FRONT...BUT OVERALL...IT APPEARS 
THAT THERE WILL BE LESS CONVECTIVE COVERAGE IN THE AFTERNOON 
COMPARED TO THE INITIAL MORNING CONVECTION. IF ENOUGH WARMING OCCURS 
AND ENOUGH LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE LINGERS IN THE DRY SLOT BEHIND THE 
INITIAL MORNING CONVECTION...THINK THAT SOME SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE 
POSSIBLE WITH THE AFTERNOON CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT. DRIER 
CONDITIONS RETURN BY MONDAY...WITH WARMER TEMPS SINCE WINDS REMAIN 
SOUTHWESTERLY AND SKIES CLEAR BEHIND THIS WEAK COLD FRONT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND HIGHER THAN GUIDANCE TONIGHT AND SUNDAY WITH HIGH 
DEWPOINTS...SOME DAYTIME BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER...AND A DELAYED 
FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...TIMING REMAINS IN QUESTION 
WITH A COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON 
TUESDAY. FRONTAL PASSAGE SHOULD PUSH THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP HIGHEST POPS LATE TUESDAY NIGHT. THE FRONT 
SHOULD EXIT THE AREA LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WITH DRY CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED WEDNESDAY NIGHT. COOLER AIR PUSHES IN BEHIND THE FRONT WITH 
AN UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH. THIS LOW MAY PRODUCE OCCASIONAL BANDS OF 
CLOUDS AND POSSIBLY A STRAY SHOWER OR TWO. FOR NOW...PRECIP CHANCES 
ARE MINIMAL AND WILL KEEP THINGS DRY THROUGH THE REST OF THE PERIOD.

STABLE AIR MASS. SCATTERED TO BROKEN MID LEVEL CLOUDS BLANKET THE 
AREA...AND WILL LIKELY REMAIN THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY...BUT WARM 
ADVECTION WITH A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW SHOULD PUSH TEMPS WELL 
INTO THE 70S THIS AFTERNOON. STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND MLCAPE 
NEAR 500 J/KG IN SW VA SHOULD LEAD TO SCATTERED TO ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS IN NORTHERN LOCATIONS AND IN ELEVATED AREAS. THE 
LOW LEVEL JET INCREASES TO 40-50 KTS OVERNIGHT...AND UPPER 
DIFFLUENCE INCREASES AS WELL AS THE RIDGE ALOFT MOVES EAST. THIS 
WILL BRING AN INCREASING CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
OVERNIGHT...THOUGH INSTABILITY WILL BE MINIMAL WITH SURFACE HEATING 
LOST. TIME FRAME FOR CATEGORICAL POPS WILL BE 06Z TO 15Z WITH THE 
PASSAGE OF THE MID LEVEL FRONT...WHICH IS FOLLOWED BY DRYING ALOFT. 
THE SURFACE FRONT LAGS BEHIND...MOVING TO THE PLATEAU BY AFTERNOON

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD AIR DAMMING WEDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
CAROLINAS...WITH DRY AIR ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...BUT DEWPOINTS 
ARE SLOWLY RISING WITH LIGHT SOUTHWEST FLOW. LOCAL RADARS ARE DEVOID 
OF ANY CONVECTION RIGHT NOW...BUT THINK SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION 
WILL BE POSSIBLE AS THE AIR MASS BECOMES SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE. LOCAL 
AIR MASS SHOULD AGAIN BECOME SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE TOMORROW...ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...SO WILL CONTINUE LOW CHANCE 
POPS FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE SHOWING SOME TIMING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE PROGRESSION OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT THIS 
WEEKEND. WRF MODEL REVEALS A SLOWER MOVEMENT THAN THE GFS MODEL... 
WHICH SEEMS MORE REALISTIC SINCE THE MAIN UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS WITH 
THIS SYSTEM MOVE NORTH INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THE ABSENCE OF 
ANY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL PUSH FURTHER SOUTH SHOULD CAUSE THE COLD 
FRONT TO MOVE SLOWER TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY...WITH 
FRONTAL PASSAGE PROBABLY NOT UNTIL SUNDAY EVENING. AS A RESULT... 
EXPECT A SCENARIO WHERE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OVER THE WESTERN 
SECTIONS OF THE TN RIVER VALLEY MOVE (AND WEAKEN) INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT ON SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE 
REDEVELOPMENT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. THE GFS MODEL IS INDICATING THAT CONVECTION WILL BECOME 
MORE WIDESPREAD OVER THE DEEP SOUTH ON SUNDAY...WHICH MAY LIMIT THE 
ACTUAL AMOUNT OF CONVECTION FURTHER NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
HOWEVER...THE WRF MODEL DOES NOT SUPPORT THIS SCENARIO...AND WILL 
MAINTAIN FORECAST CONSISTENCY FOR NOW BY KEEPING A MENTION OF LIKELY 
POPS ON SUNDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARD GFS GUIDANCE FOR 
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...BUT WILL TREND HIGHER FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS...EXTENSIVE CLOUDS...AND A DELAYED 
FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WILL HAVE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND 
WILL BE BETWEEN WEATHER SYSTEMS ON MONDAY. A COLD FRONT APPROACHES 
THE AREA LATE TUESDAY...BRINGING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. SOME CONVECTION MAY LINGER 
INTO WEDNESDAY AS THE FRONT EXITS THE REGION. AN UPPER LOW WILL BE 
TO OUR NORTH ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  THIS MAY GENERATE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SOME SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN ZONES...BUT FEEL THIS CHANCE IS 
TOO LOW TO MENTION IN THE FORECAST AT THIS TIME.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS COLD AIR DAMMING ACROSS THE

YESTERDAY. LOCAL RADARS REVEAL A FEW SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN 
NEAR THE REMNANTS OF A WEAK COLD FRONT. THETA-E ANALYSIS INDICATES

SOUTH OVER THE PLATEAU INTO SOUTHEAST TN. LIGHT SOUTHWEST WINDS ARE 
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP TODAY...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT APPEARS TO 
BE LOCATED BETWEEN TYS AND TRI THIS MORNING...WITH FALLING DEWPOINTS 
BEHIND THE FRONT TO THE NORTH. TO THE SOUTH...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE CAD WEDGE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS IS PUSHING WEST 
ACROSS GA...AND ALL THE MODELS AGREE THAT THIS MOISTURE WILL 
PROGRESS NORTHWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS MORNING. HOW LONG 
THESE CLOUDS PERSIST WILL AFFECT THE TEMPERATURES. EXPECT SOME 
EROSION TO OCCUR BY THE AFTERNOON...BUT WENT SLIGHTLY BELOW MOS 
GUIDANCE...WITH HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. THE FRONT WASHES OUT 
BY THE EVENING AND A SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS OVER THE AREA. THE 
MODELS SHOW A WEST TO EAST THETA-E GRADIENT ACROSS SW VA OVERNIGHT 
WITH LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE. THIS RESULTS IN SOME LIGHT QPF FROM THE 
MODELS...AND SOME HIGH POPS IN THE NORTH. THOUGH MOISTURE IS 
SUFFICIENT...THE MOS POPS APPEAR WAY TOO HIGH AS FORCING IS WEAK 
UNDER THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN SW VA 
AND NRN TN COUNTIES OVERNIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MOISTURE INCREASING ACROSS 
OUR NORTHERN ZONES ON SATURDAY MORNING...WILL GO WITH LOW CHANCE 
POPS ACROSS OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES AND SLIGHT POPS IN THE CENTRAL AND 
DRY IN THE SOUTH.  A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION LATE SATURDAY 
NIGHT.  THE GFS IS QUICKER THAN THE NAM IN BRINGING THE FRONT INTO 
OUR CWA.  PREFER THE SLOWER NAM AND WILL HOLD OFF HIGHEST POPS UNTIL 
SUNDAY WHEN BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT ARRIVES.  FRONT TRACKS TO THE 
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY NIGHT BRINGING DRIER WEATHER BY 
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT.  DRY WEATHER CONTINUES INTO MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT.  ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA LATE TUESDAY.  DECENT 
MOISTURE AND LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH IT...ALONG WITH SOME 
INSTABILITY...WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY.  DRY WEATHER RETURNS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUES INTO 
THURSDAY.

HOWEVER, SFC WINDS AT THIS TIME DO NOT MATCH UP WITH PICTURE MODELS 
PAINT OF VERY TIGHT GRADIENT OVER THE AREAS RAWS SITES OR ANY OTHER 
OBS LOCATIONS. BELIEVE THAT MODEL SFC PRES GRADIENT PICTURE IS 
THEREFORE OVERBLOWN. WILL DROP WIND SPEEDS A CAT EVERYWHERE 
OVERNIGHT. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS LOOK OK FOR OVERNIGHT PERIOD WITH 
SLIGHT DECREASE OF CLOUD COVER FROM CURRENT FORECAST. HAVE DROPPED 
OVERNIGHT LOWS A DEGREE OR TWO IN THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER FLOW REMAINS QUITE AMPLIFIED 
OVER THE CONUS WITH DEEP TROUGHS ALONG THE NORTHEASTERN ATLANTIC 
COAST AND OVER THE INTERMOUNTAIN WEST. AMPLIFIED UPPER RIDGE EXTENDS 
FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO TO THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION. AT THE 
SURFACE...A WEAK NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST ORIENTED FRONT CONTINUES TO 
SAG SLOWLY THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS FRONT MAY HAVE A 
DIFFICULT TIME PROGRESSING MUCH FARTHER AS BECOMES IMPEDED BY UPPER 
RIDGE. EVEN THOUGH THIS FRONT WILL BE LURKING IN OUR GENERAL 
AREA...FORCING APPEARS WEAK AND BELIEVE PRECIP WILL AGAIN BE MAINLY 
SCATTERED AND DIURNAL IN NATURE. AS A RESULT...SIGNIFICANTLY 
UNDERCUT GFS GUIDANCE (LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL) POPS IN THE FIRST 
PERIOD AND KEPT IN CHANCE CATEGORY. APPEARS COVERAGE WILL BE EVEN 
LESS IN THE SECOND PERIOD AS DIURNAL CONVECTION DISSIPATES AND UPPER 
RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO THE REGION.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE
REGION ON FRIDAY WITH COOLER TEMPS...BUT NOT BUYING THE 20 TO 60
PERCENT MOS POPS FOR FRI AND FRI NIGHT. CANT RULE OUT A VERY
ISOLATED SHOWER DURING PEAK HEATING...BUT SEEMED WISE TO KEEP
CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND NEIGHBORS FOR DRY WEATHER THOSE
PERIODS. 

NEXT SYSTEM FOR THE WEEKEND SEEMS GENERALLY ON TRACK WITH MODELS
CONSISTENT ON PERHAPS BEST RAIN CHANCES FIRST HALF OF SUNDAY...
BUT SEEMS STILL A BIT FAR OUT IN TIME TO JUSTIFY LIKELY POPS. 
A MINOR CHANGE WAS TO DROP LOW POPS ON MONDAY...GIVEN LATEST MOS
AND NEIGHBORING OFFICES ALSO DRY. THIS SEEMED A GOOD MOVE GIVEN
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND SOME DRYING BEHIND THE WEEKEND SYSTEM.

SHOWERS LOOK TO RETURN LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...WITH
OPERATIONAL GFS MODEL RUN ADVERTISING SOME MUCH COOLER 850 MB TEMPS
BEHIND THAT SYSTEM. HOWEVER...THIS MAY JUST EQUATE TO SLIGHTLY
BELOW CLIMO TEMPS BY WEDNESDAY AND ESPECIALLY ON THURSDAY. 

MAX AND MIN TEMPS WERE GENERALLY ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY EACH DAY TOWARD
THE 29/00Z GFSX MOS NUMBERS...AND SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS WERE ADDED
FOR THE NEW DAY 7 (THURSDAY).

DUE TO THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...CONVECTION IS DISSIPATING
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A BACK-DOOR COLD
FRONT...CURRENTLY ACROSS SOUTHERN VIRGINIA...WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH TOWARD
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE OVERNIGHT. WILL MAINTAIN HIGHEST
CHANCES OF SHOWERS THERE FOR REST OF THE NIGHT...WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE
OF SHOWERS ELSEWHERE.

HOURLY TEMPERATURES ARE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN FORECAST...SO HAVE LOWERED
MINS A CAT MOST LOCATIONS FOR TONIGHT. PLENTY OF MID-LEVEL CLOUDS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ORIENTED GENERALLY ALONG A 
INDIANAPOLIS TO CHARLESTON WV LINE...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AIR 
MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. LOCAL RADARS REVEAL THAT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND ADJACENT 
VALLEY AREAS...ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE AND 
DAYTIME HEATING. MOST OF THIS CONVECTION SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH 
WITH THE SETTING OF THE SUN...BUT THE PROXIMITY OF THE COLD FRONT TO 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN SHOULD HELP TO CONTINUE SCATTERED 
CONVECTION ACROSS THESE AREAS TONIGHT. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
CONTINUE SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH ON THURSDAY...WITH ADDITIONAL SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALONG IT OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT THE AIR MASS WILL BE MORE STABLE ON THURSDAY...ALONG 
WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. 
THUS...WILL KEEP POPS LOWER ON THURSDAY (COMPARED TO TODAY) ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO BUILD ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND COOLER TEMPS 
EXPECTED. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER TROF DRAGS A COLD 
FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY AND GRADUALLY RAISED POPS 
LEAVING THE MORNING DRY WITH WEST THROUGH EAST GRADIENT OF SLIGHT 
AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION POSSIBLY TRIGGERED BY WEAK 
DISTURBANCE AHEAD OF FRONT. RATCHET UP THE PROBABILITY FOR 
-SHRA/TSRA SATURDAY NIGHT WITH HIGHEST CHANCE POP ON SUNDAY WHEN 
FROPA OCCURS. TRIED TO KEEP MONDAY DRY BUT GFS KEEPS SOME WEAK 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY ALIVE IN THE WSW FLO ALOFT AND HPC BOUGHT INTO THIS 
IDEA. THUS SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR A -SHRA ON MONDAY. WAS ABLE TO KEEP 
MONDAY NIGHT DRY AWAITING ARRIVAL OF NEXT UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ORIENTED WEST-TO- 
EAST ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND WEST VIRGINIA...WITH 
UNSEASONABLY MILD TEMPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT AREA 
RADARS REVEAL A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION ACROSS MIDDLE TN ASSOCIATED 
WITH A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. THIS CONVECTION HAS BEEN ONLY 
SLOWLY MOVING NORTHEAST...AND THINK THAT IT WILL MAINLY STAY 
NORTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT COULD AFFECT THE NORTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THE COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY IS 
PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE SOUTH TODAY...AND BE LOCATED AROUND SOUTHWEST 
VA BY SUNSET. THIS MOVEMENT MAY BE TOO QUICK CONSIDERING THERE IS 
NOT MUCH UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT TO PUSH THIS FRONT SOUTH. HOWEVER... 
WILL PLAN TO KEEP RAIN CHANCES HIGHER ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON...AND THE LATEST 12Z BNA SOUNDING ALREADY 
REVEALS A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS ACROSS MIDDLE TN. THUS... 
EXPECT SOME CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE POTENTIAL 
FOR A FEW STRONG STORMS...BUT WILL LOWER RAIN CHANCES SOMEWHAT SINCE 
EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER THIS MORNING SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT THE AREAL 
COVERAGE OF THIS CONVECTION.

OVERALL...WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO LOWER POPS SOME 
AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAKENING UPPER WAVE STILL 
PROJECTED TO PASS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE 
FIRST PERIOD. MODELS AND SREF GENERALLY AGREE THAT PRECIP COVERAGE 
WILL BE QUITE EXTENSIVE WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE IN THE NORTHERN 
ZONES. HOWEVER...PRECIP AMOUNTS STILL DO NOT APPEAR VERY IMPRESSIVE 
AT THIS TIME. UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE EXITS AND UPPER RIDGE BUILDS 
BACK IN DURING THE SECOND PERIOD. ANY LINGERING PRECIP WILL BE 
MAINLY CONFINED TO THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES BY LATE IN THE SECOND 
PERIOD. FOR TEMPS...EVEN THOUGH GFS GUIDANCE HAS BEEN RUNNING A 
LITTLE COOL RECENTLY...GENERALLY FOLLOWED THOSE VALUES CLOSELY 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS WIDESPREAD PRECIP SHOULD LIMIT DIURNAL 
WARMING SOMEWHAT.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MINOR POP ADJUSTMENTS
FOR THU MORNING AS WEAK FRONT SAGS SOUTH...RAISING POPS FOR JUST
THAT BRIEF PERIOD ACROSS SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN TO MESH BETTER
WITH LATEST MOS POPS. DONT EXPECT THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO BE THE
MAIN FOCUS FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT LATER THURSDAY...FAVORING THE
LOOK OF THE NAM-WRF FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS
SUPPORTS JUST SLIGHT CHANCE OR CHANCE POPS FOR THE REST OF THURSDAY
...AND KEEPING A DRY FORECAST FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. NRN AREAS WILL
NOTICE QUITE A COOLING OF HIGH TEMPS ON THU...WITH ONLY SLIGHT
CHANGES MADE TO PREVIOUS TEMP GRIDS FOR THU AND THU NIGHT.

RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS REGION QUICKLY AGAIN ON FRIDAY...THEN GIVES WAY
TO THE APPROACHING TROUGH AND COLD FRONT BY LATE SATURDAY. TIMING
OF THIS SYSTEM LOOKED CLOSE ENOUGH AT THIS POINT...SO NO CHANGES
MADE. MAX AND MIN TEMPS WERE GENERALLY ADJUSTED CLOSER TO LATEST
GFSX MOS GUIDANCE...BUT NOT COMPLETELY WHERE A BLEND OF OLD AND NEW
GUIDANCE PRODUCED CLOSER AGREEMENT WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES. 

OTHERWISE...SOME PRELIMINARY ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO TUE NIGHT AND
ADDED NEW DAY 7 (WED) GRIDS...WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS LATE TUE
NIGHT INTO WED. NEXT SHIFT CAN LOOK AT THIS AGAIN AND MAKE SOME

HIGHS AND SUCH VERY MILD TEMPS THIS MORNING...SEEMS WISE TO GO A 
DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE THE WARMEST MOS MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY. IF THE 
CONSIDERABLE MID AND HIGH CLOUDS THIN ANY AT ALL LATER THIS MORNING

TYS IN 1910 AND 82 AT TRI IN 1989. THUS...WILL NOT ADD NEAR RECORD 
HIGH WORDING TO ZFPMRX.

OTHERWISE...RAIN CHANCES MAY BE FINALLY HEADED UPWARDS...BUT MY 
CONFIDENCE IS TOO LOW TO GO CHANCE POPS JUST YET...PREFERRING TO 
UNDERCUT MOS POPS (ESPECIALLY GFS MOS POPS WHICH HAVE BEEN MUCH TOO 
HIGH LATELY). BEST AREA FOR ANY CONVECTION WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE 
WESTERN MOST SECTIONS...WHERE HIGHEST THETA-E TEMPS AND INSTABILITY 
ARE PROGGED FOR LATE THIS AFTERNOON...AND ALSO BETTER LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE (ALTHO WEAK) WAS NOTED. THESE AREAS GET UPPER

APPROACH OF A WEAK IMPULSE MOVING INTO WESTERN SIDE OF THE UPPER

...THEN 70S AND 80S SHOULD PREVAIL YET AGAIN. RECORD HIGHS FOR THIS 
DATE WOULD NOT APPEAR TO BE IN JEOPARDY...86 AT CHA IN 1910...84 AT 
TYS IN 1910 AND 82 AT TRI IN 1989. THUS...WILL NOT ADD NEAR RECORD 
HIGH WORDING TO ZFPMRX.

OTHERWISE...RAIN CHANCES MAY BE FINALLY HEADED UPWARDS...BUT MY 
CONFIDENCE IS TOO LOW TO GO CHANCE POPS JUST YET...PREFERRING TO 
UNDERCUT MOS POPS (ESPECIALLY GFS MOS POPS WHICH HAVE BEEN MUCH TOO 
HIGH LATELY). BEST AREA FOR ANY CONVECTION WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE 
WESTERN MOST SECTIONS...WHERE HIGHEST THETA-E TEMPS AND INSTABILITY 
ARE PROGGED FOR LATE THIS AFTERNOON...AND ALSO BETTER LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE (ALTHO WEAK) WAS NOTED. THESE AREAS GET UPPER 
LEVEL SUPPORT AS DIVERGENCE ALOFT DEVELOPS THIS EVENING WITH THE 
APPROACH OF A WEAK IMPLUSE MOVING INTO WESTERN SIDE OF THE UPPER 
RIDGE. THUS...I CONTINUED THE SLIGHT POPS OVERNIGHT FOR PLATEAU 
COUNTIES. IF NO PRECIPITATION OCCURS AT MOS SITES...THEN TRACK 
RECORD GENERALLY SUPPORTED ABOVE GFS MOS MINS AT CHA AND TYS...BUT 
NEAR OR BELOW GFS MOS MINS FOR TRI AND RHP.


.LONG TERM...(WED THROUGH MON)...WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON WEDNESDAY RESULTING IN UPPER 
RIDGE BEING SUPPRESSED. HOWEVER...MAIN DYNAMICS WITH THE SHORT WAVE 
WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE AREA PER OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SREF. AS 
SUCH..APPEARS PRECIP WILL BE SCATTERED IN NATURE. THUS HAVE UNDERCUT 
GFS GUIDANCE POPS ON WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. UPPER FLOW 
BECOMES HIGHLY AMPLIFIED BY THURSDAY AS DEEP TROUGH DRIFTS SOUTH 
ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST AND RIDGE AMPLIFIES OVER THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY. THIS WILL PUSH A BACK-DOOR COLD FRONT INTO OUR NORTHEASTERN 
ZONES RESULTING IN SOMEWHAT COOLER AIR FOR THOSE AREAS.

NEXT ORGANIZED SYSTEM WILL APPROACH IN THE LATE SATURDAY/EARLY 
SUNDAY TIME FRAME AS MORE SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST FROM 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS. APPEARS TEMPS WILL COOL SLIGHTLY BUT STILL 
REMAIN SOMEWHAT ABOVE CLIMO THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD.

302 AM EDT MON MAR 26 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PERHAPS TWO POINTS TO MAKE ARE 
THAT ONCE AGAIN THERE WAS VERY LITTLE IF ANY CONVECTIVE PCPN 
ANYWHERE NEAR OUR FORECAST AREA YESTERDAY...AND THAT THE 26/00Z GFS 
MODEL LOOKS MUCH TOO WET INITIALLY FROM 00Z THROUGH 12Z TODAY.
THIS WOULD MAKE THE GFS MOS POPS APPEAR TO BE MUCH TOO HIGH FOR TODAY
...WHEN SENSIBLY CONSIDERING THAT ONLY MINOR CHANGES IN THE AIRMASS 
HAVE OCCURED FROM YESTERDAY. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE 
INCREASING FROM YESTERDAY...BUT MOST OF THIS CAN BE ATTRIBUTED TO 
THE INCREASE IN MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS THAT ARE MOVING ENE 
THROUGH THE UPPER RIDGE. GREATER SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY NOTED FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT PATTERN WOULD JUST SEEM TO SUPPORT 
ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. THUS...POPS
WERE REMOVED FROM THE VALLEY LOCATIONS AND LOWERED TO SLIGHT CHANCE 
ELSEWHERE.

FOR TEMPS...MID AND HIGH CLOUDS ARE HOLDING MIN TEMPS SEVERAL 
DEGREES ABOVE 24 HOURS AGO...SUCH THAT LNP WAS A VERY MILD 70 
DEGREES AT 06Z WITH A LOT OF LOW TO MID 60S NOTED AS WELL. THIS 
MAKES THE COOL HIGHS FROM GFS MOS SUSPECT (LIKELY BIASED BY THE 
EXAGGERATED CONVECTIVE QPF)...SO I OPTED FOR A BLEND OF THE NGM AND 
NAM-WRF MOS HIGHS (WHICH WILL BE A FEW DEGS BELOW YESTERDAY BUT 
STILL VERY NEAR RECORD HIGHS OF 84 AT CHA...83 AT TYS AND 82 AT TRI).

MINS TONIGHT GENERALLY ACCEPTED NEAR A BLEND OF SIMILAR MOS...EXCEPT
TO UNDERCUT TRI AND RHP BASED ON PERSISTENT PATTERN THOSE LOCATIONS 
OVER THE PAST FEW NIGHTS.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...FAIRLY GOOD SHORT WAVE 
WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE TO JUSTIFY 
POPS.  WARM FRONT LINGERING IN THE AREA THROUGHOUT MUCH OF THE 
PERIOD BUT BASED ON LAST SYSTEM HAVE LOWERED POPS TO SUB 15 PERCENT 
AND HAVE TAKEN PRECIP OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR MUCH OF THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS.  NEXT GOOD CHANCE OF PRECIP FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY.

STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE VALUES FOR MAX AND MIN TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. SUNNY SKIES AND NEAR RECORD HIGH 
TEMPS THIS AFTN. WILL MONITOR BOUNDARY JUST NE OF AREA FOR 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. NO UPDATE PLANNED. SON 

SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RIDGE HOLDING ACROSS EASTERN STATES 
THIS MORNING WITH JUST SOME PATCHY HIGH CLOUDS THINNING AS THEY MOVE 
EAST THROUGH THE RIDGE. AIRMASS REMAINS WARM AND RELATIVELY 
DRY...ESPECIALLY BELOW 750 MBS AS NOTED ON EVENING OHX AND RNK 
SOUNDINGS. MOS DEW POINT TEMPS WERE A BIT HIGH COMPARED TO CURRENT 
OBSERVATIONS...ESPECIALLY OVER NE TN AND SW VA...SO MADE THESE 
ADJUSTMENTS AGAIN THIS MORNING.

MAX TEMPS SHOULD EASILY REACH 70S TO MID OR UPPER 80S...WITH RECORD 
HIGHS FOR TODAY BEING 87 AT CHA...88 AT TYS AND 85 AT TRI. MY CCF 
NUMBERS WOULD BE A RECORD HIGH FOR CHA AT 88 DEGS...BUT FALL 1 TO 3 
DEGREES BELOW RECORDS ELSEWHERE.

REACHING THESE WARM HIGHS DOES GENERATE SOME INSTABILITY LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...AND LOW LEVEL FLOW IS WEAKLY 
CONVERGENT IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN NEAR RNK AND GSP FORECAST AREAS
(WHERE SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS WERE NOTED). THUS...ADDED SOME 
VERY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS (ABOUT HALF OF GFS MOS VALUES) TO EASTERN 
PARTS OF RUSSELL AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES OF SW VA...NRN TN MTNS AND 
SMOKY MTNS FOR GRID PERIODS FROM 21Z TO 01Z.  

FOR MIN TEMPS TONIGHT...WENT CLOSE TO SIMILAR MOS NUMBERS...EXCEPT 
FOR UNDERCUTTING CHA AND TRI GIVEN DRY AIRMASS...LIGHT WINDS AND 
PAST FEW NIGHTS MIN TEMPS.

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A BACKDOOR COLD FRONT WILL 
REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FOR MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY WITH MODELS SHOWING WEAK-MODERATE INSTABILITY OVER THE 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE FORECASTS AREA. CONVERGENCE 
ALONG STATIONARY FRONT WEAK AND GIVEN DROUGHT CONDITIONS PRODUCING 
LOWER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LEVELS...FEEL ANY AFTERNOON-EVENING 
CONVECTION WILL BE ISOLATED. WILL UNDER-CUT GUIDANCE.

FOR WEDNESDAY...FIRST IN SERIES OF UPPER SHORT-WAVES WILL SLAM INTO
PERSISTENT SOUTHEAST UPPER RIDGE. MODELS SHOW UPPER RIDGE WEAKENING 
SOME AS WAVE RIDES THE RIDGE AXIS PRODUCING STRONGER BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW.
WILL UP POPS SOME...BUT FEEL EXTENDED MODELS ARE OVER-DOING CHANCES GIVEN
CONTINUED DROUGHT CONDITIONS.

FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...UPPER RIDGE RE-ESTABLISHES ITSELF AHEAD OF
MUCH STRONGER UPPER TROUGH MOVING FROM THE ROCKYS INTO THE PLAINS STATES
FOR LATE INTO THE WEEK. AT THE SAME TIME...WEDGING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS
WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD DRIER AIR INTO THE REGION...SO LITTLE IF ANY
CONVECTION ANTICIPATED.

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...UPPER TROUGH MOVES NORTH OF THE AREA...BUT
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL PULL EAST ACROSS THE REGION FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY MORNING PROVIDING THE BEST CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...DECIDED TO GO A DEGREE OR TWO HIGHER THAN GFS

OUR NORTH...GENERALLY ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY WITH A DIP ACROSS W VA

OCCURRING THIS MORNING IN THE VICINITY OF THE WEAK FRONT THAN 24

THIS FAR SOUTH. INTERESTING THAT NAM-WRF MODEL FROM 23/00Z RUN WAS 
WETTER THAN GFS...BUT NOW 24 HOURS LATER...24/00Z GFS RUN IS WETTER

LEVEL MOISTURE...ONLY SLIGHT INSTABILITY LATE TODAY...AND NO FOCUS 
FOR ANY DEVELPOMENT OTHER THAN WEAK FRONT AND DAYTIME HEATING. 
SO...A SENSIBLE FORECAST OF MAINLY DRY EXCEPT FOR 15-20% POP LATE 
TONIGHT IN THE FAR NE AREAS. BETTER INSTABILITY SUNDAY...BUT STILL 
SEEMS TO LACK ANY DEEP MOISTURE AND A TRIGGER/FOCUS.

OTHERWISE...DECREASED SKY COVER IN GRIDS FOR ESPECIALLY SRN AREAS.
CLOSE TO GFS MOS ON HIGHS TODAY...THEN A BLEND OF MOS FOR MINS 
TONIGHT...ALTHO DID UNDERCUT TRI MIN TO GIVE MORE OF THE RANGE NOTED 
PAST FEW NIGHTS FROM CHA AND TYS TO TRI MIN.

SUNDAY AS WEAK BOUNDARY MAY MOVE SOUTHWEST INTO NE TN. INSTABILITY 
IS GREATER BUT DECIDED TO KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS OUT OF SUNDAY FOR NOW. TEMPERATURES STILL VERY WARM 
AND FOLLOWED BLEND OF WRF/GFS. RIDGE BEGINS TO BE PUSHED SOUTH 
MONDAY WITH MOISTURE AND COOLER AIRMASS TRYING TO MOVE FARTHER WEST 
MONDAY. THINK THERE WILL BE BETTER CHANCE TO GET SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FORMING OR MOVING SOUTHEAST INTO AREA AROUND THE RIDGE 
FROM THE NORTH. NEW LOW PRESSURE AREA DEVELOPS AND DEEPENS OVER THE 
ROCKIES TUESDAY WITH STRONG LOW LEVEL FEED OF MOISTURE INTO MS

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...EXPECT UPPER RIDGE TO FLATTEN A 
BIT TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT ANY THREAT OF MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION 
LOOKS TO BE MAINLY TO OUR NORTH. LATEST RADAR AND SATELLITE PICS 
SHOW A WEAKENING AREA OF CONVECTION MOVING EAST ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY...AND THINKING IS THAT NAM-WRF IS OVER ZEALOUS IN SPREADING 
PRECIPITATION SE INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED...WITH FORECAST SOUNDINGS NOT GENERATING 
MUCH IF ANY SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY. THERE ARE VERY WARM TEMPS 
ALOFT WHICH CREATES A CAP AND SOME NEGATIVE BUOYANCY TO OVERCOME.

THUS...KEPT THE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT TRENDED TOWARD THE 
DRIER GFS MODEL SOLUTION...WITH JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS SW VA 
AND EXTREME NRN PARTS OF CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES.  NGM MOS OUT 
PERFORMED OTHER MOS GUIDANCE FOR THU MAX TEMPS...BUT NGM/GFS HIGHS 
WERE QUITE CLOSE AND A GOOD CHOICE FOR TODAY. FEW SPOTS MAY TOP 80 
DEGREES TODAY...BUT NO RECORD HIGHS APPEAR TO BE IN JEOPARDY (CHA 86/
TYS 85/TRI 79).  DECIDED TO GO WITH A MOS BLEND FOR MINS RATHER THAN 
COOLER GFS MOS...GIVEN AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
PCPN FOR TONIGHT. 

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WARM UPPER RIDGE FLATTENS 
A LITTLE SATURDAY BUT REMAINS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES FOR THE 
MOST PART THIS WEEKEND. STATIONARY BOUNDARY ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
AND MID ATLANTIC WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO SW VA TO GIVE MORE 
CLOUDINESS AND A SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS. HEIGHTS RISE SLIGHTLY 
SATUDAY AND SUNDAY SO HIGHS ARE EXPECTED TO REACH THE LOWER 80S MOST 
PLACES. THIS COULD REACH A RECORD AT TRI CITIES ON SATURDAY. 
FOLLOWED MAV GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS THIS WEEKEND CONSIDERING THAT IT HAS 
BEEN VERY DRY THIS MONTH. HIGH PRESSURE STRENGTHENING ALONG THE EAST 
COAST SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY MAY MOVE MOISTURE BACK TOWARDS THE 
MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST FROM THE BOUNDARY SATURDAY SO HAVE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS MONDAY. UPPER LOW ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST MOVES INTO 
THE MS VALLEY AS A BROAD TROUGH/COLD FRONT. SOUTHERLY FLOW INCREASES 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AS FRONT APPROACHES. 
THE FRONT MAY NOT GO THROUGH BEFORE IT MOVES BACK NORTH AS WARM 
FRONT WEDNESDAY BECAUSE OF THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE. CHANCE POPS 
WILL STAY IN FORECAST THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. THURSDAY HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS BACK IN. TEMPERATURES SHOULD STAY MILD MONDAY THROUGH

.DISCUSSION...A BEAUTIFUL NIGHT ON TAP.  SOME MID AND HIGH CLOUDS 
PRESENT AND TEMPERATURES HOLDING IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S SO 
FAR.  DEW POINTS GENERALLY IN THE MID AND UPPER 40S WHICH IS WHERE 
THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS THE OVERNIGHT LOWS SO THEY SEEM 
REASONABLE.  NO CHANGES IN CURRENT FORECAST PLANNED.


.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS SOUTH OF AREA THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. WARMING 
TREND CONTINUES. CURRENT DPS RUNNING PRETTY HIGH BUT EXPECT SOME 
DRYING LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. DO NOT EXPECT STRONG 
LOW LEVEL INVERSION TO SET UP AGAIN TONIGHT SO WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG 
NOT ANTICIPATED. ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS POSSIBLE THIS EVENING ACROSS 
NE TN/SW VA BUT CHC TOO LOW TO MENTION IN FORECAST. 

.LONG TERM...(THU NIGHT THROUGH WED)...GENERALLY PLEASANT WEATHER 
WITH ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS EXPECTED THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD AS 
UPPER RIDGE PERSISTS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS A 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH THAT SWING THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. STILL QUITE A 
BIT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO TIMING AS MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
REMAIN IN DISAGREEMENT. THUS HAVE CONTINUED TO SPREAD CHANCE POPS 
ACROSS SEVERAL PERIODS EVEN THOUGH EVENT WILL LIKELY NOT LAST THAT 
LONG. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED ENSEMBLE GUIDANCE THROUGH THE 
LONG TERM PERIOD ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCE WITH GFS GUIDANCE IS VERY SMALL

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS
SOUTH OF AREA THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. WARMING TREND CONTINUES. 
CURRENT DPS RUNNING PRETTY HIGH BUT EXPECT SOME DRYING LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. DO NOT EXPECT STRONG LOW LEVEL 
INVERSION TO SET UP AGAIN TONIGHT SO WIDESPREAD DENSE FOG NOT 
ANTICIPATED. ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS POSSIBLE THIS EVENING ACROSS NE 
TN/SW VA BUT CHC TOO LOW TO MENTION IN FORECAST. 

.LONG TERM...(THU NIGHT THROUGH WED)...GENERALLY PLEASANT WEATHER 
WITH ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS EXPECTED THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIOD AS 
UPPER RIDGE PERSISTS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. THE ONLY EXCEPTION IS A 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH THAT SWING THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. STILL QUITE A 
BIT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO TIMING AS MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
REMAIN IN DISAGREEMENT. THUS HAVE CONTINUED TO SPREAD CHANCE POPS 
ACROSS SEVERAL PERIODS EVEN THOUGH EVENT WILL LIKELY NOT LAST THAT 
LONG. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED ENSEMBLE GUIDANCE THROUGH THE 
LONG TERM PERIOD ALTHOUGH DIFFERENCE WITH GFS GUIDANCE IS VERY SMALL 
FOR THE MOST PART.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT APPEARS TO 
HAVE MOVED LITTLE TODAY AND IS STILL OVER SOUTHERN KY THIS 
AFTERNOON. SOUTHERLY WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT ALLOWED TEMPERATURES 
TO RISE INTO THE 60S TO LOWER 70S AREAWIDE. A SMALL AREA OF SHOWERS 
PRODUCING LIGHT RAIN WAS OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND MOVING EAST 
NORTHEAST TOWARD THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY. WEAK VORT MAXES 
AND SOME LIFT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH EVENING AND SHOULD CONCENTRATE 
SHOWERS FROM I-40 NORTHEAST TOWARD VA BEFORE DECREASING LATER 
TONIGHT. A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE TOO. THE ATMOSPHERE SHOULD 
DRY OUT LATER TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS FRONT TO THE NORTH WEAKENS 
AND RIDGING STRENGTHENS TO THE SOUTH. DECREASED POPS TONIGHT FROM 
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. ONLY HAVE POPS NORTHEAST SECTIONS WEDNESDAY. 
GENERALLY FOLLOWED WRF/GFS BLEND FOR TEMPERATURES BOTH TONIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY.   


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...WARM FRONT LIFTS
NORTH OF THE REGION LEAVING A MOISTER AND WARMER AIR MASS IN PLACE.
A SERIES OF VERY WEAK UPPER DISTRUBANCES WILL SWING THROUGH THE
AREA WHICH MAY TRIGGER A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS BUT BASICALLY NOT
ENOUGH AT THIS TIME TO PUT RAIN IN EVERY DAY. DID INCREASE POPS A
LITTLE ON FRIDAY IN THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE
NEXT BIGGER CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION IS SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY
WHEN THE UPPER LOW THAT IS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING OF THE CALIFORNIA
PACIFIC COAST FINALLY SWINGS THROUGH WITH AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT.
LEANED MAINLY TOWARDS GFS FOR GUIDANCE AND GFS ENSEMBLE AVERGE FOR NUMBERS.

.DISCUSSION...WEAK COLD FRONT APPEARS TO LIE OVER SOUTHERN KY THIS 
MORNING. LIGHT SOUTHERLY WINDS AND WARMER TEMPERATURES ARE SOUTH OF 
THE BOUNDARY AND LOW CLOUDS AND FOG LIE NORTH OF THE FRONT IN KY. 
SOME LIGHT RAIN IS OCCURRING TO THE NORTH AND WEST OVER EASTERN KY

THE FORECAST AREA. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO SAG SOUTH INTO NORTHERN 
SECTIONS OF TN BEFORE STALLING...AND THEN LIFT BACK NORTH AS A 
WARM FRONT TONIGHT. BEST CHANCES OF RAIN BASED ON TRACK OF CURRENT 
PRECIPITATION AND FRONT LOCATION WILL BE WEST CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
SECTIONS WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER CHANCES SOUTH AND EXTREME EAST. THE 
FRONT WILL SHIFT BACK TO THE NORTHEAST TONIGHT AS A WARM FRONT. 
FORCING FOR PRECIPITATION NOT THAT GREAT SO WILL STILL HAVE CHANCE 
POPS ALL ZONES TODAY. WILL CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE THUNDER CENTRAL

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SKIES WERE PARTLY TO 
MOSTLY CLOUDY TODAY AS MOISTURE CONTINUES TO INCREASE AHEAD OF COLD 
FRONT MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED INTO THE 
60S AS WELL MUCH WARMER THAN YESTERDAY. THE WARMING WAS HELPED BY 
SOUTHWEST WINDS WHICH HAVE INCREASED THIS AFTERNOON. SUSTAINED WINDS 
OF 10 TO 20 MPH WITH GUSTS UP TO 30 MPH ARE OCCURRING AT MID 
AFTERNOON ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BETWEEN 
THE FRONT AND DEPARTING HIGH PRESSURE TO THE SOUTHEAST. LINE OF 
PREFRONTAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS SLOWLY MARCHING SOUTHEAST 
TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. BELIEVE THIS WILL DECREASE 
IN INTENSITY AND SPEED TOWARD SW VA AND NORTHERN TN LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. EXPECT FRONT TO MOVE TOWARD THE AREA BUT NOT 
QUITE MAKE IT BEFORE MORNING. STILL INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY NORTH 
AND NORTHEAST WITH POSSIBLE THUNDER TO THE NORTH. TUESDAY IS MORE 
UNCERTAIN AS FRONT SAGS SOUTH AND THEN MIGHT BECOME STATIONARY BY 
THE END OF THE DAY. MORE CLOSELY FOLLOWED NAM POPS TONIGHT WITH 
LIKELY IN THE NORTH AND TUESDAY THINK BEST CHANCE POPS WILL BE TO 
THE NORTHWEST. PUT RAIN CHANCES SLIGHTLY LOWER THAN BOTH NAM/GFS 
GUIDANCE CENTRAL AND SOUTH TUESDAY.     


.LONG TERM...A SERIES OF FRONTS MOVE ACROSS THE AREA WITH 2
BECOMING EAST/WEST ORIENTED ACROSS THE AREA. THE FIRST IS THE
FRONTAL SYSTEM IN THE SHORT TERM AND ANOTHER ON FRIDAY. WITH THE
FIRST SYSTEM THE RAINS SHOULD BE ENDING TUESDAY NIGHT.  IF THE SECOND
SYSTEM FOLLOWS THE CURRENT FORECAST...WE MAY SEE SOME RAINS ON
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY ASSOCIATED WITH IT THEN SOME MORE ON SUNDAY AS
IT MOVES NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT COLD
FRONT WHICH WOULD MOVE IN VERY LATE MONDAY. AT THE PRESENT
TIME...NONE OF THE SYSTEMS LOOK LIKE BIG RAIN MAKERS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
AS A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA TODAY DRIFTS TO THE
EAST...A SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL DEVELOP OVERNIGHT. MOISTURE WILL
ADVECT INTO THE AREA FROM THE SOUTHWEST...BRINGING SOME CLOUDS TO
SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE CLOUDS WILL
SPREAD TO THE NORTHEAST AND WE SHOULD SEE A BROKEN CLOUD DECK
ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA BY NOON. AS THE FRONT SINKS INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY THROUGH THE DAY...THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL TIGHTEN AND
WINDS WILL INCREASE TO 10 TO 20 MPH. A WELL MIXED BOUNDARY LAYER
COULD RESULT IN GUSTY WINDS IN THE AFTERNOON. REMOVED POPS FROM
MONDAY AFTERNOON AS DEEP MOISTURE HOLDS OFF UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...DEEPER MOISTURE MOVES
SOUTH INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE OHIO
VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT BUT VERY SLOWLY. BETTER CONVERGENCE AND LIFT
STAYS TO THE WEST OVER MIDDLE AND WEST TN. WENT BELOW GUIDANCE ON
POPS WITH BEST CHANCE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SW VA.
TUESDAY LOOKS TO BE THE BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS AS FRONT GETS CLOSER
BUT MIGHT NOT EVER MAKE IT ACROSS TN BORDER. SOUTHERN SECTIONS MAY
EVEN MISS OUT ON ANY MEASURABLE RAIN. DROPPED HIGHS A FEW DEGREES
TUESDAY WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUDS. GRADUALLY DECREASING POPS TUESDAY
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS FRONT MOVES BACK NORTH. RIDGING STRENGTHENS
ACROSS THE EAST COAST AND SOUTHEAST FOR THE END OF THE WEEK INTO

WARM TO ABOVE NORMAL AS WELL.

THIS AFTERNOON...THOUGH EASTERN PORTIONS OF RUSSELL AND WASHINGTON 
COUNTIES MAY SEE SOME ADDITIONAL FLURRIES. WITH THE LOSS OF SURFACE 
HEATING...SCATTERED CU OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA WILL 
DISSIPATE. HIGH AND MIDLEVEL CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER JET
AND CHANNELED VORTICITY OVER THE MS VALLEY WILL CROSS THE AREA THIS
EVENING. HOWEVER SKIES SHOULD BE CLEAR BY MIDNIGHT AS THESE
FEATURES MOVE EAST. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND A RISING HEIGHTS
ALOFT WILL PROVIDE CLEAR SKIES FOR SUNDAY. WITH PLENTY OF SUN AND
NEUTRAL ADVECTION...HIGHS SHOULD REBOUND TO THE 50S IN THE VALLEY
WITH 40S NORTH AND IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...TROUGH THAT WAS OVER
THE EAST SHIFTS EAST SUNDAY NIGHT WITH SURFACE HIGH BEGINNING TO
SHIFT EAST AS WELL. SYSTEM IN CANADA DROPS DOWN TO THE GREAT LAKES
WITH FRONT MOVING INTO WESTERN GREAT LAKES. SHOULD SEE HIGH CLOUDS
INCREASE SUNDAY NIGHT WITH SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPING ALOFT.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER EXCEPT POSSIBLY AT TRI CITIES AIRPORT
BUT EVEN THERE THE LOW MAY COME EARLY. COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTH
MONDAY TOWARDS FORECAST AREA BUT WENT ON LOW SIDE OF POPS DUE TO
UNCERTAINTY OF TIMING AND IF IT WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH DURING THE DAY
FOR SHOWERS TO BREAK OUT. MODELS SHOW RAPID MOISTURE INCREASE
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY AND AM NOT SURE THAT IT WILL HAPPEN THAT
FAST. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS FRONT
MOVES INTO TN THEN SHIFTS BACK TO THE NORTH AS WARM FRONT TUESDAY
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. UPPER TROUGH DIGS INTO THE WESTERN STATES TUESDAY
NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY FOLLOWED BY RIDGING IN THE SOUTHEAST THURSDAY
THROUGH SATURDAY. ENDED RAIN CHANCES EARLY WEDNESDAY AND KEPT

.DISCUSSION...
REPORTS OBTAINED ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN INDICATE MAINLY A DUSTING
OF SNOW IN LOWER ELEVATIONS...WITH A HALF INCH ACCUMULATION IN
HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND IN WISE COUNTY VA. THE PRIMARY FORCING FOR
THE SNOW SHOWERS IS STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES NEAR 10 C/KM FROM
THE SURFACE TO AROUND 800 MB. RUC AND NAM MODELS MAINTAIN THIS
INSTABILITY THROUGH THE DAY...SO EXPECT THAT THE SHOWERS WILL
PERSIST INTO THE AFTERNOON. 850 MB TEMPS DO START TO WARM LATE IN
THE AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD DECREASE SHOWER COVERAGE AND
INTENSITY. WILL RAISE POPS IN SW VA AND NE TN...WITH MAXIMUM
ACCUMULATIONS NEAR ONE INCH. TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING CLOSE TO

TONIGHT. PRECIP WILL DIMINISH FROM SW TO NE TODAY.  WITH COLD 
ADVECTION TONIGHT...LOW LEVEL WINDS AND THERMAL PROFILES LOOK 
FAVORABLE ENOUGH TO GO WITH CHANCE POPS FOR SNOW SHOWERS IN THE 
NORMALLY FAVORED AREAS.  WILL ALSO KEEP MORE CLOUDINESS AROUND 
DESPITE MODELS ATTEMPT TO DRY THINGS OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY.  GIVEN WIND 
TRAJECTORIES COMING FROM THE GREAT LAKES...THINK THERE WILL BE 
ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR QUITE A BIT OF CLOUDS AT LEAST NORTH ALONG WITH 
MENTIONED POPS.     

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...FORECAST STARTS OUT MORE 
LIKE THE WINTER SEASON WE SHOULD BE TRANSITIONING FROM AS CHILLY AIR 
A GOOD 15 TO 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL CONTINUES TO POUR INTO THE 
REGION WITH AMPLIFIED UPPER TROF SHIFTING SLOWLY EAST WHILE 
DEEPENING OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. SHORTWAVE ENERGY ROTATING 
AROUND THE BACK SIDE OF THE TROF WITH DEEP MOISTURE OVER SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MAY LEAD TO A CONTINUATION OF LIGHT 
SNOW SHOWERS ESPECIALLY IN HIGHER TERRAIN SATURDAY WITH CONCLUSION 
SATURDAY NIGHT. DRIER NORTHWESTERLY FLOW FILLS IN BEHIND TROF FOR 
SUNDAY WITH SURFACE RIDGE IN PLACE. THICKNESS BUILDS RAPIDLY 
ALLOWING MAX TEMPS TO APPROACH NORMAL FOR MID MARCH. THE WARMING 
TREND CONTINUES ON MONDAY AS LOW LEVEL FLOW GOES SOUTHERLY AHEAD OF 
ANOTHER COLD FRONT WHICH BUILDS SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY ON ITS 
WAY TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY ON TUESDAY. USED SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
FOR THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU MONDAY AFTERNOON WHILE ADJUSTING UPWARD 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY INTO THE LOW CHANCE RANGE WITH FRONT IN 
PROGGED TO BE IN THE VICINITY. GFS SHOWS MORE AMPLIFICATION TO THE 
UPPER PATTERN TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WITH UPPER TROF 
APPROACHING THROUGH THE PLAINS STATES. FRONT GETS A PUSH BACK NORTH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA AS THIS HAPPENS AND USED A FANCY DECREASE IN 
POPS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH AS WARM SECTOR BUILDS INTO THE REGION. A 
SHOWER OF TWO MAY DEVELOP ON THURSDAY AS WEAK SHORTWAVE FEATURES

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THE COLD FRONT ACROSS KENTUCKY THIS AFTERNOON WILL PUSH SOUTH AND 
MOVE THROUGH OUR AREA LATE TONIGHT. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...MOISTURE 
CONVERGENCE AND A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL PRODUCE OCCASIONAL SHOWERS. 
THERE HAVE BEEN NO LIGHTNING STRIKES DETECTED SO FAR TODAY...BUT THE 
PRECIP IS LOOKING MORE CONVECTIVE OVER MIDDLE TN IN THE PAST FEW

THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THUS WILL ONLY INCLUDE ISOLATED THUNDER IN 
THE EVENING FOR THE WESTERN AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. FROPA 
IS SLOW...BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z THROUGH OUR AREA. ALIGNMENT OF THE 
FRONT TO THE UPPER FLOW SUGGESTS AN ANAFRONT STRUCTURE...SO SOME 
PRECIP AND OVERCAST SKIES WILL LIKELY PERSIST INTO FRIDAY MORNING 
BEHIND THE FRONT. BY AFTERNOON SOME DRIER AIR ALOFT WILL WORK INTO 
THE AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST...AND LOCATIONS IN SW VA AND THE PLATEAU 
MAY SEE SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS. POPS WILL TAPER OFF TO JUST A 
SLIGHT CHANCE EAST BY THE LATE AFTERNOON. WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS 
REMAINING AND COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT...TEMPS WILL LIKELY 
NOT RISE MUCH ON FRIDAY FROM OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 40S AND 50S. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD AIR ADVECTION 
BEHIND TONIGHTS COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
WITH MUCH COLDER AND DRIER AIR WORKING IN. FREEZING LEVELS WILL DROP 
AND A CHANGEOVER TO SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS MAY OCCUR ACROSS PART OF 
SW VA AND THE NE TN MOUNTAINS BUT LEFT OVER MOISTURE LOOKS TO BE NOT 
SIGNIFICANT FOR MORE THAN TRACE AMOUNTS AT THIS TIME. THE MAIN 
AFFECT OF THE FRONT WILL BE TO DROP TEMPERATURES TO NEAR TO BELOW 
FREEZING FRIDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL KEEP CLOUD COVER 
AROUND IN THE MOUNTAINS AND NE TN/SW VA THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY 
SATURDAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THAT AREA IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 
40S. FARTHER SOUTH CLOUDS SHOULD BE MORE SCATTERED BUT WITH COLD AIR 
ADVECTION CONTINUING AS COLD UPPER TROUGH MOVES OVERHEAD AND SURFACE 
HIGH BUILDS SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO 
REACH INTO THE 50S. AFTER A CLEAR COLD NIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT WHICH 
SHOULD BE THE COLDEST AND ALL AREAS BELOW FREEZING UPPER TROUGH 
SHIFTS EAST SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM A LITTLE. SOUTHWEST 
WINDS DEVELOP AS HIGH SHIFTS EAST AND A NEW COLD FRONT MOVES INTO

PRECIP AND OVERCAST SKIES WILL LIKELY PERSIST INTO FRIDAY MORNING 
BEHIND THE FRONT. BY AFTERNOON SOME DRIER AIR ALOFT WILL WORK INTO 
THE AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST...AND LOCATIONS IN SW VA AND THE PLATEAU 
MAY SEE SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS. POPS WILL TAPER OFF TO JUST A 
SLIGHT CHANCE EAST BY THE LATE AFTERNOON. WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS 
REMAINING AND COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT...TEMPS WILL LIKELY 
NOT RISE MUCH ON FRIDAY FROM OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 40S AND 50S. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD AIR ADVECTION 
BEHIND TONIGHTS COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
WITH MUCH COLDER AND DRIER AIR WORKING IN. FREEZING LEVELS WILL DROP 
AND A CHANGEOVER TO SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS MAY OCCUR ACROSS PART OF 
SW VA AND THE NE TN MOUNTAINS BUT LEFT OVER MOISTURE LOOKS TO BE NOT 
SIGNIFICANT FOR MORE THAN TRACE AMOUNTS AT THIS TIME. THE MAIN 
AFFECT OF THE FRONT WILL BE TO DROP TEMPERATURES TO NEAR TO BELOW 
FREEZING FRIDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL KEEP CLOUD COVER 
AROUND IN THE MOUNTAINS AND NE TN/SW VA THROUGH MUCH OF THE DAY 
SATURDAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES IN THAT AREA IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 
40S. FARTHER SOUTH CLOUDS SHOULD BE MORE SCATTERED BUT WITH COLD AIR 
ADVECTION CONTINUING AS COLD UPPER TROUGH MOVES OVERHEAD AND SURFACE 
HIGH BUILDS SOUTH FROM THE GREAT LAKES TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO 
REACH INTO THE 50S. AFTER A CLEAR COLD NIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT WHICH 
SHOULD BE THE COLDEST AND ALL AREAS BELOW FREEZING UPPER TROUGH 
SHIFTS EAST SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM A LITTLE. SOUTHWEST 
WINDS DEVELOP AS HIGH SHIFTS EAST AND A NEW COLD FRONT MOVES INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL RISE BACK TO NEAR NORMAL. 
NEXT FRONT MOVES THROUGH TUESDAY WITH CHANCE OF RAIN. WEDNESDAY 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STRENGTHENS AND TEMPERATURES STAY 
MILD.

.DISCUSSION...
RAIN SHOWERS IN MIDDLE TN AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ARE ASSOCIATED
WITH A VORT MAX OVER WEST TN THIS MORNING. THIS FEATURE WILL TRACK
EAST AND SPREAD PRECIP INTO OUR AREA THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...AND
THE CURRENT FORECAST OF LIKELY POPS LOOKS GOOD. HEAVIEST PRECIP WILL
LIKELY HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER 00Z HOWEVER...ASSOCIATED WITH BETTER
LOW LEVEL FORCING NEAR THE COLD FRONT. INSTABILITY APPEARS
MINIMAL...WITH PLENTY OF CLOUDS LIMITING SURFACE HEATING. LATEST
NAM SHOWS THE BEST INSTABILITY THIS AFTERNOON TO OUR SOUTH AND
WEST...AND MAINLY THIS EVENING. WILL REMOVE THE MENTION OF THUNDER
FROM THE NORTH AND EAST THIS AFTERNOON. SOME ADJUSTMENTS WILL BE
NEEDED TO HOURLY TEMPS...BUT EXPECT THAT HIGHS WILL GENERALLY END
UP CLOSE TO THE CURRENT FORECAST.

CHOICE FOR THIS PERIOD. SIGNIFICANT WAVE PASSES BY LATE THURSDAY, 
WITH MUCH COOLER AIR BEHIND PUSHING MOISTURE OUT OF AREA BY LATE 
FRIDAY. LINGERING SHOWERS ON FRIDAY MORNING MOST AREAS WILL MOVE 
QUICKLY EAST BY AFTERNOON. STRONG LOW LEVEL COLD ADVECTION WILL DRY

AND GOOD PCPN CHC THU-EARLY FRI. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED JUST NORTH AND WEST OF THE AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON. SOME OF THESE SHOWERS COULD AFFECT THE NORTHERN PLATEAU 
AND SW VA NEAR THE KY BORDER...BUT NO MORE THAN SCATTERED COVERAGE. 
AS THESE STORMS LACK UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT AND ARE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY 
SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY...THEY WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET 
AND WILL END POPS BY MIDNIGHT. 

ON THURSDAY THE UPPER LOW OVER THE SRN MS VALLEY WILL MERGE WITH THE 
DEEPENING TROUGH OVER GREAT LAKES. MOISTURE FROM THE CLOSED LOW WILL 
SPREAD INTO OUR AREA FROM THE SOUTH IN THE MORNING. LIFT REMAINS 
WEAK UNTIL THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING WHEN THE TROUGH TO THE NORTH 
BEGINS TO SAG SOUTH. INSTABILITY WILL BE MARGINAL WITH LI BARELY 
UNDER ZERO IN THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. WILL 
MENTION ONLY ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS SOUTH AND WEST. LOWERING 500 MB 
HEIGHTS AND INCREASING UPPER DIVERGENCE AS THE JET MOVES SOUTH WILL 
PROVIDE CATEGORICAL POPS OVERNIGHT. THE FRONTAL PASSAGE IS DELAYED 
SLIGHTLY FROM THE UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN 
FRIDAY UNTIL THE FRONT IS THROUGH THE AREA BY THE AFTERNOON. COLD 
ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT WILL LIMIT HIGH TEMPS ON FRIDAY TO THE

LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WE WILL BE BETWEEN

TROUGH SWINGING ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS ON SATURDAY. WRF MODEL IS 
NOT AS AMPLIFIED WITH THIS UPPER TROUGH AS THE GFS MODEL. WITH THIS

LEVEL TROUGHING SLOWLY APPROACHES THROUGH THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY. MOISTURE ADVECTION INCREASES MAINLY MID AND UPPER LEVELS AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT NOT IMPRESSIVE AS WEAK SHORTWAVE FEATURES RIDE 
ACROSS THE REGION IN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. THINK GUIDANCE POPS

WITH EVENT WITH 6HR AMOUNTS IN EXCESS OF ONE INCH. MUCH LESS 
RAINFALL IS EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. REINFORCING JET SEGMENT DIGS INTO 
UPPER TROUGH LATE ON FRIDAY AS TROUGH SHARPENS AND MOVES NORTHEAST OF THE

SLIPS SOUTHEAST AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE PERIOD WITH 
WEAKENING UPPER LOW PROGGED TO MOVE AT A SNAILS PACE FROM WESTERN 
TEXAS TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY 00Z THURSDAY. THIS RESULTS 
IN ADVECTION OF MOIST AIR WHICH EVENTUALLY BECOMES DEEP ENOUGH IN 
ISENTROPIC REGIME TO REQUIRE THE USE OF CHANCE POPS WHICH USED ON 
WEDNESDAY FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWER OR TWO (HIGHEST CHANCE ON 
THE PLATEAU). MOST EXCELLENT WARMTH TO CONTINUE WITH HIGHS WELL 
ABOVE NORMAL AND STAYED NICE AND CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND CONCERNING 
TEMP FORECAST.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WEAKENING SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH MOVES EASTWARD THROUGH TN VLY THROUGH THU. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OVER AREA. WAA AND LAYER RH 
INCREASES IN SW FLOW. PCPN CHC INCREASES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND BECOMES 
LIKELY THU AND THU NGT...AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES. LIFT AND 
INSTABILITY LOOK MARGINAL AT THIS POINT SO WILL LEAVE OUT 
THUNDERSTORM MENTION. DIGGING JET PUSHES FRONT THROUGH THE S 
APPALACHIANS EARLY FRI. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BUT REMAINS

330 PM EDT MON MAR 12 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SURFACE RIDGE GRADUALLY 
SLIPS SOUTHEAST AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE PERIOD WITH 
WEAKENING UPPER LOW PROGGED TO MOVE AT A SNAILS PACE FROM WESTERN 
TEXAS TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY 00Z THURSDAY. THIS RESULTS 
IN ADVECTION OF MOIST AIR WHICH EVENTUALLY BECOMES DEEP ENOUGH IN 
ISENTROPIC REGIME TO REQUIRE THE USE OF CHANCE POPS WHICH USED ON 
WEDNESDAY FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWER OR TWO (HIGHEST CHANCE ON 
THE PLATEAU). MOST EXCELLENT WARMTH TO CONTINUE WITH HIGHS WELL 
ABOVE NORMAL AND STAYED NICE AND CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND CONCERNING 
TEMP FORECAST.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WEAKENING SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH MOVES EASTWARD THROUGH TN VLY THROUGH THU. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE CONTINUES TO WEAKEN OVER AREA. WAA AND LAYER RH 
INCREASES IN SW FLOW. PCPN CHC INCREASES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND BECOMES 
LIKELY THU AND THU NGT...AS FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES. LIFT AND 
INSTABILITY LOOK MARGINAL AT THIS POINT SO WILL LEAVE OUT 
THUNDERSTORM MENTION. DIGGING JET PUSHES FRONT THROUGH THE S 
APPALACHIANS EARLY FRI. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BUT REMAINS 
CENTERED WEST OF AREA. RESULTING NORTHERLY FLOW WILL DRAG SOME LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE THROUGH NE PART OF MRX CWA. SCT SHOWERS AND A FEW 
FLURRIES POSSIBLE INTO SAT MORNING MAINLY ACROSS SW VA. RIDGE SLIDES 
EAST THROUGH AREA ON SUNDAY. ANOTHER ROUND OF PCPN SETS UP IN 
PREFRONTAL ENVIRONMENT BY LATE MONDAY.

239 AM EDT MON MAR 12 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WITH A DRY 
AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL 
SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND SOUTHERN PLAINS... 
AND THINK THAT ONLY A FEW HIGH THIN CLOUDS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARD 
THE WARMER NGM AND WRF MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS WITH SOUTHERLY WINDS AND 
NEAR-FULL SUNSHINE EXPECTED. 


.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE LONG TERM 
REMAINS SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES BY MID WEEK. STILL APPEARS THAT 
THURSDAY WILL HAVE THE GREATEST CHANCE OF PRECIP AS UPPER 
TROUGH/SURFACE FRONT SWINGS THROUGH THE AREA. MOISTURE INCREASES 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON WEDNESDAY AS SYSTEM ADVANCES 
EASTWARD FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS. HOWEVER...APPEARS GFS GUIDANCE 
POPS ARE OVERDONE AS SREF GENERALLY DOES NOT SUPPORT THE GFS 
WIDESPREAD PRECIP PROJECTION. THIS PLUS THE DRY REGIME WEVE 
EXPERIENCE RECENTLY MAKES IT UNLIKELY THAT ANYTHING MORE THAN 
SCATTERED PRECIP WILL OCCUR. WILL KEEP POPS IN CHANCE CATEGORY FOR 
WEDNESDAY AT THIS TIME. IN THE MEANTIME...HEIGHT RISES PORTEND 
WELL-ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS FOR EARLY WORK WEEK. TEMPS WILL TEND TO FALL 
BELOW CLIMO FOLLOWING PASSAGE OF SURFACE COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY...BUT 
A RETURN TO DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SKIES HAVE CLEARED ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH DRIER AIR DROPPING RELATIVE HUMIDITIES INTO 
THE TEENS TO MID 30S. BOUNDARY LAYER HAS DRIED SO MUCH THAT DONT 
EXPECT ANY PATCHY FOG LIKE THIS MORNING. WENT CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR 
MINS...WHICH MAY NEED TO BE WATCHED GIVEN MID AFTERNOON DEW POINT 
TEMPS. SURFACE RIDGE DROPPING SLOWLY SE FROM THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
SHOULD CREATE A WEAK EASTERLY FLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS...BUT VALLEY 
WINDS MAY DECOUPLE OR STAY LIGHT NE OVERNIGHT. POSSIBLE FOR A FEW 
CLOUDS TO DEVELOP TOWARD DAYBREAK ACROSS SOUTHERN AND EASTERN MOST 
ZONES...OTHERWISE MOSTLY CLEAR.

LOW LEVEL FLOW TURNS WEAK SW TO W BY MONDAY AFTERNOON...WHICH
SHOULD ADVECT IN SLIGHTLY HIGHER DEW POINT TEMPS...AND ALSO CREATE
A QUITE WARM AFTERNOON. FAVORED AT OR JUST ABOVE THE GFS MOS MAX
TEMPS GIVEN PAST FEW DAYS. BLEND FOR MINS LOOKED GOOD FOR MONDAY
NIGHT...THEN DRY AND EVEN WARMER ON TUESDAY...AS CLOSED UPPER LOW
OVER NM/TX REMAINS WELL TO OUR WEST AND SW LOW LEVEL FLOW
STRENGTHENS SLIGHTLY.

FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS WILL BE THE RELATIVELY LOW RH PERCENTAGES
MONDAY AFTERNOON...BUT THE SW TO W SURFACE WINDS SHOULD REMAIN
LIGHT. 


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER LEVEL FLOW 
GRADUALLY TRANSITIONS TO SOUTHWEST AS UPPER LOW ADVANCES SLOWLY EAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
WEAKENING WHILE PHASING WITH NORTHERN STREAM SYSTEM. THIS LEADS TO 
INCREASED MOISTURE AND TEMPERATURE ADVECTION FOR ABOVE NORMAL WARMTH 
AND INCREASING CHANCE FOR RAIN WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS COLD 
FRONT PRESSES SLOWLY SOUTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY (HIGHEST 
POP ON THURSDAY). FRONT DEPARTS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND WAS ABLE TO DROP OUT POPS FOR A DRY BUT COLDER SATURDAY 
AND SUNDAY AS NORTHWEST FLOW ESTABLISHES ITSELF

FRONT HAVING EASED SOUTH OF THE AREA. DEW POINT TEMPS STILL IN THE 
LOWER 50S AT CHA WHERE SOME PATCHY DENSE FOG DEVELOPED...BUT ALL 
VSBYS HAVE COME UP TO 3 MILES OR BETTER.

12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS INDICATE TEMPS SHOULD EASILY REACH 60S 
ACROSS THE AREA...WITH A RANGE FROM UPPER 50S HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR SLOWLY FILTERING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. AN 
AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE...CURRENTLY OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY... 
WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ACROSS THE REGION AND BECOME CENTERED OVER 
THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY TONIGHT. AS A RESULT...EXPECT DRY 
WEATHER WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS TODAY AND TONIGHT. 
AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARD THE WARMER GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...SINCE THESE NUMBERS HAVE BEEN VERIFYING BETTER 
LATELY. 


.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...DRY WEATHER WITH ABOVE CLIMO 
TEMPS IN STORE FOR EARLY WORK WEEK AS RIDGING SURFACE AND ALOFT
CONTINUES TO BUILD INTO THE REGION. NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES BY MID
WEEK. INCONSISTENCIES IN TIMING WITH THIS SYSTEM CONTINUE IN LATEST
GFS RUN...AND ENSEMBLES REMAIN QUITE CHAOTIC PRECLUDING MUCH HELP.
WILL CONTINUE LOW CHANCE POPS OVER AN EXTENDED TIME PERIOD TO COVER
TIMING UNCERTAINTIES. TEMPS WILL REMAIN ABOVE CLIMO UNTIL PASSAGE
OF SURFACE FRONT WHEN TEMPS WILL FALL WELL BELOW CLIMO LATE IN THE
LONG TERM PERIOD. GFS GUIDANCE TEMPS GENERALLY APPEAR REASONABLE
AND DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM THOSE VALUES.

338 PM EST SAT MAR 10 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...ONLY SYSTEM TO POSSIBLY
BRING ANY PRECIPITATION TO THE FORECAST AREA...WILL BE THE
APPROACHING WEAK COLD FRONT. HOWEVER...AIRMASS REMAINS STABLE AND
CLOUD BASES HAVE YET TO LOWER SIGNIFICANTLY. NAM-WRF AND RUC MODELS
SHOW A BRIEF PERIOD THIS EVENING UP TO AROUND 06Z SUNDAY WITH SOME
WEAK LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE...THUS KEPT A SIMILAR POP LOOK TO
PREVIOUS GRIDS. DID DECREASE POPS AND WORD AS CHANCE OR SLIGHT
CHANCE ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC AREAS...WHERE MODEL QPF IS BARELY
MEASURABLE. KEPT A SMALL AREA OF LIKELY (60 PERCENT) POPS FOR SW VA
EARLY TONIGHT...AND CARRIED SCATTERED WORDING WHERE CHANCE POPS
WERE USED IN MOST REMAINING AREAS. REMOVED SUNDAY MORNING POPS.

OTHERWISE...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SPREADS ACROSS MUCH OF THE
EASTERN STATES INTO MONDAY...PROVIDING DRY AND WARM WEATHER.
AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITIES WILL FALL INTO THE 20 PRECENT RANGE
...BUT AT LEAST WINDS LOOK TO BE VERY LIGHT WITH SURFACE HIGH
BUILDING IN FROM THE NORTH.

FOR MOS...UNDERCUT MOS POPS FOR TONIGHT. WENT ABOVE MOS HIGHS BOTH
DAYS GIVEN PAST PERFORMANCE...DRY AIRMASS AND WESTERLY WINDS ON
MONDAY. MINS LOOKED REASONABLE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...ATMOSPHERE REMAINS DRY 
IN THE EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH SURFACE RIDGING 
CUTTING OFF MOISTURE RETURN FROM THE GULF. EVENTUALLY MOISTURE DOES 
RETURN BY MID WEEK IN TIME FOR SOME SHORTWAVE ENERGY AND A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WHICH REQUIRES RAISING POPS FROM SLIGHT EARLY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING TO MEDIUM CHANCE BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS SURFACE WAVE DRAGS 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA. DRIER AND COLDER NORTHWEST FLOW CREATES 
A COOLER BUT UNEVENTFUL END OF THE WEEK.

CLOUD BASES REMAIN MORE IN THE MID DECK RANGE...EXCEPT FOR SE TN AND

MODIFIED OHX SOUNDING FOR HIGHS IN THE MID 60S DID NOT YIELD MUCH 
SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY (CAPES LESS THAN 100 J/KG).  CONSIDERING 
THIS PLUS SEVERAL HOURS BEFORE LOW LEVELS SATURATE...WILL KEEP POPS

BOUNDARY LINGERING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. DEWPOINTS REMAIN LOW 
NORTH OF THIS BOUNDARY ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...BUT

REVEAL WEAK LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF THIS FRONT...WITH WEAK 
UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS AS WELL. THUS...ONLY EXPECT A FEW SCATTERED 
SHOWERS TODAY...MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. AS

WEDNESDAY/EARLY THURSDAY TIME FRAME. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY AS 
ENSEMBLES PROJECT BEST CHANCE TO OCCUR LATER ON THURSDAY. AS 
SUCH...HAVE NOT MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO POPS FOR THIS TIME

.SHORT TERM...HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST U.S. IS
BRINGING WARM MOIST AIR INTO THE REGION IN ADVANCE OF AN
APPROACHING COOL FRONT. THIS FRONT IS CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS THE
GREAT PLAINS INTO TEXAS. AS THE FRONT ENTERS THE REGION...THERE
WILL BE A FEW SHOWERS SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...HOWEVER
THESE SHOWERS WILL BE RELATIVELY LIGHT...GENERALLY LESS THAN A
QUARTER INCH. SKIES WILL REMAIN CLOUDY INTO SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES
WILL MODERATE A FEW DEGREES WITH THE FRONT BUT STILL REMAIN ABOVE
NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE FIRST HALF OF THE
PERIOD FEATURES DRY WEATHER WAITING ON SOME MOISTENING OF LOW LEVEL
DEWPOINTS THROUGH THE DEEP SOUTH AS WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHIFTS
SLOWLY EAST ACROSS NORTHERN GULF COAST. AT THE SAME TIME WEAK COLD
FRONT DROPS STEADILY SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY WITH ARRIVAL ON
THURSDAY. NOT A GREAT DEAL OF CONFIDENCE HERE AS WEAK FORCING NOTED

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE SOUTHERN TN 
BORDER...WITH A DRY AIR MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONT IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT TODAY...AS LIGHT SOUTHERLY 
WINDS DEVELOP AHEAD OF A WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS. 
THESE SOUTHERLY WINDS SHOULD HELP TO PROVIDE A NICE WARM-UP ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH HIGHS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO YESTERDAYS 
VALUES. THE COLD FRONT OVER THE PLAINS WILL SLOWLY APPROACH WEST TN 
BY SUNRISE TOMORROW...WITH A FEW PRE-FRONTAL SHOWERS POSSIBLE ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TN AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AS A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
APPROACHES.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SERIES OF WEAK UPPER WAVES 
COUPLE WITH A DIFFUSE...NEARLY STATIONARY SURFACE BOUNDARY OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WILL KEEP WEATHER SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED 
OVER THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK PER MODEL AND SREF 
CONSENSUS. ANY PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT AND SCATTERED HOWEVER

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
235 AM EST FRI MAR 9 2007

.DISCUSSION...A WEAK UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM THAT BROUGHT SOME CLOUDS TO 
THE AREA IS MOVING OFF TO THE EAST WHICH SHOULD RETURN THE REGION TO 
SUNNY SKIES.  HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER NORTHEAST U.S. BEGINNING 
TO SLOWLY GIVE WAY TO A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT PLAINS 
REGION.  SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL BRING INCREASING MOISTURE AND WARM 
TEMPERATURES TO THE AREA TODAY INTO TOMORROW.  A COLD FRONT WITH THE 
LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL TRIGGER SOME LIGHT SHOWERS IN THE REGION 
TOMORROW INTO SATURDAY NIGHT.  FORECAST FOR TODAY STILL LOOKS GOOD 
WITH MILD SPRING LIKE TEMPERATURES AND MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES.  

FORECAST FOR SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT WILL BE INTERESTING AS THE 
SYSTEM WILL BE LIMITED IN MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY SO LIKELYHOOD OF 
RAIN IN QUESTION.  WILL TACKLE THAT QUESTION WITH THE AFTERNOON 
FORECAST.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE 
SOUTHERN TN BORDER...WITH A DRY AIR MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
THIS FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTH AS A WARM FRONT TODAY...AS LIGHT 
SOUTHERLY WINDS DEVELOP AHEAD OF A WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
PLAINS. THESE SOUTHERLY WINDS SHOULD HELP TO PROVIDE A NICE WARM-UP 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH HIGHS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO 
YESTERDAYS VALUES. THE COLD FRONT OVER THE PLAINS WILL SLOWLY 
APPROACH WEST TN BY SUNRISE TOMORROW...WITH A FEW PRE-FRONTAL 
SHOWERS POSSIBLE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AS A 
WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE APPROACHES.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SERIES OF WEAK UPPER WAVES 
COUPLE WITH A DIFFUSE...NEARLY STATIONARY SURFACE BOUNDARY OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WILL KEEP WEATHER SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED 
OVER THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK PER MODEL AND SREF 
CONSENSUS. ANY PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT AND SCATTERED HOWEVER 
AS MOISTURE PROFILE REMAINS UNIMPRESSIVE PER MODEL TIME-HEIGHT 
SECTIONS. ANOTHER PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER FOLLOWS FOR MID WEEK BEFORE 
ANOTHER POSSIBLY MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM APPROACHES BY EARLY 
THURSDAY. WITH THE EXCEPTION OF UNDERCUTTING POPS ON SATURDAY...

A VORT MAX PASSING TO OUR SOUTH WILL BRING SOME HIGH CLOUDS TO THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
314 PM EST THU MAR 8 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WEAK SHORTWAVE/VORT
MAX HAS SPUN EAST INTO W TN AND N MS THIS AFTERNOON...AND MAY
PRODUCE A BRIEF PERIOD OF SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUDS FOR SRN AREAS
LATER TONIGHT. ALSO...PAINTED IN A FEW CLOUDS OVER FAR ERN AREAS
DUE TO WEAK SE LOW LEVEL FLOW COMING AROUND THE SURFACE RIDGE.
DRY FORECAST LOOKS GOOD FOR TONIGHT...AND GENERALLY FAVORED MILDER
MINS FOR SRN AREAS AND SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT MOS FOR SW VA AND NE TN
WHERE LESS CLOUDS WILL OCCUR.

A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUDS LINGERS FOR FRIDAY WITH SOME AFTERNOON
CUMULUS CLOUDS POSSIBLE...ALTHO HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD THIN WITH
PASSAGE OF WEAK SHORTWAVE. MOS OFFERS MAX TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW
TODAYS HIGHS...WHICH IS REASONABLE BUT MAY NOT OCCUR IF HIGH CLOUDS
DIMINISH EARLY ENOUGH.

MOISTURE AND CLOUDS CONTINUE TO INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT AS BETTER
SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW DEVELOPS AHEAD OF THE NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM.
HOWEVER...LOOKS SAFE TO KEEP FORECAST DRY UNTIL SATURDAY DAYTIME.
GFS MODEL MAY BE OVERDOING MOISTURE RETURN AND PRECIPITATION...
SO I TRENDED MORE TO A MOS BLEND FOR LOWS/HIGHS FRIDAY NIGHT AND
SATURDAY...AND ALSO UNDERCUT GFS MOS POPS CONSIDERABLY FOR NOW. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY MEANDERS NEAR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ON SUNDAY WHILE A 
DISTURBANCE PRESSES SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. 
MONDAY/TUESDAY TIMEFRAME. BASICALLY A PERIOD OF MODEL UNCERTAINTY 
WITH DIFFERING SOLUTIONS BUT MAINTAINED SOME CONTINUITY WITH A SMALL 
BIT OF POP TO DEAL WITH POSSIBILITY OF ENOUGH LIFT AND MOISTURE TO 
CREATE A FEW -SHRA DURING THIS PERIOD. LATER MODEL RUNS WILL BRING 
MORE FOCUS TO THIS TRANSITIONAL PERIOD (WINTER TO SPRING) WHERE 
PRESSURE GRADIENTS BECOME MORE RELAXED WHILE THE JET RETREATS TO 
HIGHER LATITUDES. TRENDED TOWARD THE HPC SOLUTION WHICH ALLOWS FOR A 
DRY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

.DISCUSSION...NOT VERY EVIDENT WHERE THE WEAK COLD FRONT CAN BE 
FOUND THIS MORNING...EXCEPT FOR LOWER DEW POINT TEMPS IN THE 20S 
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN.  TEMPS APPEAR TO BE WARMING ON TRACK TO 
REACHING THE FORECASTED VALUES OF MOSTLY 60S TO LOWER 70S.  WINDS 
ARE VERY LIGHT AND VARIABLE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...A WELCOMED 
CHANGE FROM YESTERDAYS BREEZY SW-W WINDS.

SKIES REMAIN JUST ABOUT CLOUD FREE...ALTHO I HAVE NOTED THE 
SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX MOVING ESE INTO SRN MO/NRN AR.  THIS FEATURE IS 
PROGD TO GENERALLY PASS JUST TO OUR SOUTH OVERNIGHT...AND MAY 
PRODUCE A FEW CLOUDS BUT NO PRECIPITATION.

ZFPMRX SHOULD NOT NEED AN UPDATE THIS MORNING.  HOWEVER...WILL CHECK

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK COLD FRONT THAT WAS 
SUPPOSED TO HAVE MOVED THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY 
EVENING IS STILL LYING OVER THE CENTRAL VALLEY THIS MORNING. 
SATELLITE PICTURES SHOWS SOME HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA OTHERWISE CLEAR SKIES PREVAIL. TEMPERATURES 
VARY WIDELY WITH MID TO UPPER 30S NORTHEAST AND IN THE VALLEYS OF 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA TO THE MID AND UPPER 40S ALONG AND JUST 
SOUTH OF THE WEAK FRONT. THE FRONT SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE 
SOUTH INTO GEORGIA AND ALABAMA TODAY. EXPECTING TEMPERATURES TO WARM 
TO LEVELS ABOUT LIKE YESTERDAY EVEN WITH THE FRONT EXCEPT A FEW 
DEGREES COOLER NORTH. WINDS WILL BE MOSTLY LIGHT AND VARIABLE AND 
LOWEST RELATIVE HUMIDITIES ABOUT 5 PERCENT HIGHER DUE TO LESS 
MIXING. GFS IS HINTING AT SOME INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
TONIGHT SO WILL GO WITH MOS GUIDANCE AND KEEP LOWS A COUPLE DEGREES 
WARMER THAN THIS MORNINGS.      

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
RIDGE FROM THE ATLC THROUGH THE EXTREME S APPALACHIANS TO THE LWR MS 
RVR VLY DOMINATES THE EARLY EXTENDED PERIOD. MRX CWA IN SW FLOW WITH 
WAA. TEMPS AT LEAST 5 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. A WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES 
ACROSS THE AREA ON SAT WHICH COULD TRIGGER SCT SHWRS. WARM 
TEMPS...WEAK LIFT AND ABOVE NORMAL MOISTURE KEEP SCT PCPN CHC GOING

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK PRESSURE FALLS ACROSS 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA AS WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHES. A 19Z 
SURFACE ANALYSIS WOULD PLACE THE FRONT FROM THE SRN TIP OF ILLINOIS 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF KY. SUSTAINED SW TO W WINDS AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT HAVE GENERALLY HELD AROUND 15 TO 20 MPH WITH SOME GUSTINESS 
EXCEEDING 25 MPH AT TIMES. THIS PLUS LOWER THAN EXPECTED DEW POINT 
TEMPS AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER MAX TEMPS...HAS YIELDED DANGEROUS FIRE 
WEATHER CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON. WILL LET OUR PREVIOUSLY ISSUED 
SPSMRX PRODUCT CONTINUE TO COVER THE SITUATION...BUT MAY FRESHEN IT 
UP WITH THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE. WINDS DIMINISH THIS EVENING AND A 
BLEND OR CLOSER TO GFS MINS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT.

OTHERWISE...LATER PERIODS LOOK DRY AS RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
INTO THE REGION. HOWEVER...A WEAK DISTURBANCE PASSING TO OUR SW 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES THURSDAY NIGHT AND A WEAK RETURN OF 
SOUTHERLY FLOW AS SURFACE RIDGE SHIFTS EAST...WILL BRING MILDER MIN 
TEMPS AND INCREASING CLOUDS LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. MORE OF 
THIS CLOUDINESS LOOKS TO AFFECT SRN AREAS...BUT ABLE TO KEEP THE 
FORECAST DRY FOR NOW. CHOSE GFS MOS FOR HIGHS FRIDAY...AND A BLEND 
FOR HIGHS THURSDAY AND FOR MINS THURSDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT APPROACHING 
THE AREA ON SATURDAY...WENT WITH THE SLOWER NAM AND KEPT FRIDAY 
NIGHT DRY.  BEST MOISTURE REMAINS TO THE NORTH OF OUR CWA...BUT 
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT ENOUGH TO CARRY CHANCE POPS ON SATURDAY.  FRONT 
LINGERS IN THE REGION ON SUNDAY...BEST MOISTURE TO THE NORTH 
AGAIN...BUT WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING INTO SUNDAY.  DRIER WEATHER 
PUSHING IN ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.  AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
TRACKING ACROSS THE GULF STATES ON TUESDAY THEN PUSHES NORTH ON

1031 AM EST WED MAR 7 2007

.DISCUSSION...WEAK COLD FRONT TO OUR WEST SHOULD ONLY BRING A
GRADUAL SHIFT IN DIRECTION AND INCREASING SPEEDS IN THE AFTERNOON
AS MIXING STARTS TO OCCUR. HIGH CLOUDS HAVE THINNED A BIT PER
SATELLITE PICS THIS MORNING...SO SHOULD SEE PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY
SKIES. 12Z UPPER AIR SOUNDINGS SUPPORT MAX TEMP FORECAST...ALTHO
15Z TEMPS WERE RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE GRIDS WHERE MIXING
WAS ALREADY UNDERWAY.

MAIN CONCERNS AND TIME SPENT THIS MORNING HAS BEEN ON FIRE WEATHER
ITEMS. CURRENT DEW POINT TEMPERATURES WERE CONSIDERABLY LOWER THAN
FORECAST GRIDS...WITH SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO REFLECT LOWER DEW
POINTS AND HUMIDITIES. DONT THINK THAT WIND SPEEDS WILL GET MUCH
ABOVE PREVIOUS FORECAST GRID VALUES.

HOWEVER...BASED ON CALLS MADE TO TN/VA/NC FORESTRY OFFICIALS...WE
WILL ISSUE A FIRE DANGER STATEMENT DUE TO DRY CONDITIONS AND AT
LEAST BREEZY WIND SPEEDS THIS AFTERNOON.

LOWER 40S IN THE VALLEYS AND UPPER 40S TO NEAR 50 ON THE EXPOSED 
RIDGES. A LARGE COLD UPPER TROUGH WAS OVER EASTERN CANADA AND THE 
NORTHEAST STATES. MOISTURE MOVING AROUND THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THIS 
FEATURE FROM MI INTO OH AND PA WAS PRODUCING LIGHT SNOW. HIGH 
PRESSURE WAS OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES WITH LOWER PRESSURE OVER MO. 
A WEAK COLD FRONT EXTENDED INTO THE TX PANHANDLE  AND A WEAK WARM 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY STRETCHED ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY INTO EAST 
TN. DEW POINTS ACROSS SW VA WERE IN THE TEENS THIS MORNING WITH MID 
20S TO MID 30S ACROSS MOST OF EAST TN AND SW VA. THE COLD FRONT WILL 
SLOWLY MOVE SOUTHEAST AND CROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING AND INCREASE WINDS FROM THE WEST TO SOUTHWEST. THE SYSTEM IN 
THE OHIO VALLEY WILL KEEP SKIES PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY ACROSS SW VA 
AND PART OF NE TN BUT DO NOT EXPECT ANY RAINFALL. WINDS SHOULD 
INCREASE FROM THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST TO 10 TO 15 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 
25 MPH IN THE AFTERNOON AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. MINIMUM RH VALUES 
SHOULD DROP TO AROUND 25 PERCENT IN SOME CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
EASTERN MOUNTAIN LOCATIONS. GENERALLY FOLLOWED A NAM/GFS BLEND FOR 
TEMPERATURES TODAY AND TONIGHT.        

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
RIDGE SOUTH INTO THE AREA WITH A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH TO THE SE. A 
WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE SE INTO THE MID TN VLY ON THU. SOME CLOUDS 
ACROSS S PART OF CWA ONLY CONCERN. SHORT WAVE MOVES EAST OF AREA FRI 
WHILE SFC RIDGING SLIDES SE ALLOWING FOR CONTINUED WARMING TREND. 
HIGH UNCERTAINTY WITH REMAINDER OF FORECAST. MAIN FLOW WELL NORTH OF

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...ONLY SUBTLE CHANGES FROM
PERSISTENT TRANQUIL WEATHER IN STORE OVER THE SHORT TERM. NEXT IN
THE SERIES OF WEAK NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVES APPROACHES ON
WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THAT THIS FEATURE WILL REMAIN NORTH
OF OUR FORECAST AREA AND ITS ONLY EFFECTS FOR OUR AREA WILL BE AN
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER...ESPECIALLY IN OUR NORTHEASTERN
ZONES...AND AN INCREASE IN WIND. TEMPS SHOULD ALSO REBOUND AS
SOUTHWEST SURFACE FLOW INCREASES. GFS GUIDANCE TEMPS APPEAR
REASONABLE BASED ON EXPECTED CONDITIONS AND WERE GENERALLY FOLLOWED
CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A FRONT WILL CROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND MOVE INTO OUR AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER SINCE THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BE 
NORTHWESTERLY THE MOISTURE WILL BE VERY SHALLOW...BELOW 800 MB IN
MODEL CROSS SECTIONS. SOME WEAK LIFT MAY BE PROVIDED BY CONVERGENCE
WITH THE 850 MB TROUGH. WILL REMOVE POPS BUT MENTION A CHANCE OF
SPRINKLES IN SW VA WEDNESDAY EVENING.

THE 850 MB RIDGE TO OUR SOUTH WILL KEEP GULF MOISTURE CUT OFF FROM 
OUR AREA AND PROVIDE DRY WEATHER ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THE RIDGE 
BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST ON FRIDAY NIGHT AS A WEAK TROUGH CROSSES THE 
PLAINS...BUT THE RIDGE HANGS ON ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST CONUS. A 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALLOWS FOR SOME MOISTURE RETURN ON SATURDAY...BUT 
THE BEST LIFT REMAINS TO OUR NORTH. THIS PATTERN OF A RIDGE TO OUR 
SOUTH WITH SHORTWAVES PASSING TO OUR NORTH PERSISTS THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...SO DETERMINING A MORE NARROW PERIOD OF HIGHER POPS IS 
DIFFICULT THIS FAR OUT. WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POPS THAT 
ARE CURRENTLY FORECAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE GFS HAS ALSO BEEN 
INCONSISTENT IN THE PLACEMENT OF A CLOSED LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS...WHICH LOWERS CONFIDENCE IN THE MODELS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
WILL KEEP MONDAY AND TUESDAY DRY FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...DRY/BENIGN WEATHER PATTERN 
EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS AREA REMAINS IN DRY 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. WEAK UPPER WAVE APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH 
TONIGHT...BUT ONLY AFFECT IS EXPECTED TO BE SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUD 
COVER...MAINLY IN THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES. GFS GUIDANCE TEMPS APPEAR 
REASONABLE AND WERE FOLLOWED CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A CLOSED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE OVER EASTERN CANADA AND NEW 
ENGLAND...WITH A RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL CONUS. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
ROTATES AROUND THE LOW...TAKING A SURFACE LOW AND FRONT THROUGH THE 
OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS ON WEDNESDAY. THE MODELS DIFFER 
WITH THE PLACEMENT OF THE FRONT. THE GFS HAS A STRONGER RIDGE ALOFT 
WHICH GIVES A STRONGER SURFACE HIGH OVER THE PLAINS THAT PUSHES THE 
FRONT TO OUR SOUTH. THE NAM IS LESS AGRESSIVE WITH THE 
FRONT...KEEPING IT ACROSS OUR NORTH...AND IS ALSO SLOWER AND DRIER. 
WILL LEAN TOWARD THE NAM BECAUSE OF ITS BETTER CONTINUITY WITH THIS 
SYSTEM. WILL HAVE ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN SW VA ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. 

RIDGING ALOFT WILL KEEP DRY WEATHER OVER THE AREA FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY. A SOUTHERLY FLOW DEVELOPS ON FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE HIGH MOVES 
TO OUR EAST. A FRONT WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY AS AN UPPER 
TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. GFS HAS SHOWN POOR 
CONSISTENCY IN THE DETAILS FOR THE WEEKEND...SO WILL HAVE ONLY A 
SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POP THROUGH MONDAY.

UPPER LEVEL FORCING IN THE FORM OF ISENTROPIC LIFT...BOUNDARY LAYER
CONVERGENCE...UPPER JET STRUCTURE PRODUCING DIVERGENCE ALOFT

WEDGE OVER THE AREA WILL HELP KEEP THE STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS
ABOVE THE SURFACE. HOWEVER...AS SURFACE TROUGH PASSES AND
CONVECTION MOVES THROUGH ENOUGH MIXING WILL OCCUR TO GET RID OF
BOUNDARY LAYER WEDGE...SO AN HOUR OR TWO OF STRONGER WINDS UP TO
35-40 MPH GUSTS POSSIBLE EVEN IN THE VALLEYS AND PLATEAU AREAS THIS
EVENING.

FOR FRIDAY...FRONT MOVES QUICKLY EAST WITH PRECIPITATION ENDING
EARLY FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE SUNRISE. CLEARING SKIES AND MILDER

1025 AM EST THU MAR 1 2007

.DISCUSSION...
A LARGE AREA OF RAIN AND EMBEDDED CONVECTION IS MOVING RAPIDLY
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA OF PRECIPITATION IS
DUE TO ISENTROPIC LIFT...BOUNDARY LAYER CONVERGENCE NOTED AT 850
MB...AND STRONG UPPER JET ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES PLACING AREA
UNDER FAVORED LEFT EXIT REGION. ELEVATED INSTABILITY IS PRODUCING
THUNDERSTORMS OVER MIDDLE TENNESSEE...SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE INTO NORTHERN
GEORGIA. THIS AREA OF PRECIPITATION WILL PERSIST ACROSS MUCH OF THE
FORECAST AREA TODAY...HOWEVER...DOWNSLOPE WINDS OF THE APPALACHIANS
WILL LIMIT PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY.

MAIN PROBLEM IS POTENTIAL OF SEVERE CONVECTION LATE TODAY AND THIS
EVENING AS WARM FRONT MOVES NORTHEAST ERODING THE LOW LEVEL WEDGE
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. LATEST SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLES SHOW
THIS WEDGE REMAINING OVER MOST OF THE AREA THROUGH THE DAY AND NOT
ERODING UNTIL JUST BEFORE PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH PASSAGE THIS EVENING.

CAPES WILL BE LIMITING FACTOR FOR SEVERE CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY
AREA NORTH AND EAST OF TYS. HOWEVER...HIGH SHEAR ENVIRONMENT AND
STRONG BOUNDARY LAYER JET WILL MAIN POTENTIAL OF DAMAGING WINDS
ASSOCIATED WITH BOW ECHOES AND LARGE HAIL. ISOLATED TORNADO OVER
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AS POSSIBILITY...BUT GREATEST THREAT FOR LARGE
TORNADO OUTBREAK WILL BE ACROSS ALABAMA AND CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
GEORGIA LATE TODAY DUE TO PROXIMITY OF WARM FRONT AND INSTABILITY.

HAVE MADE SOME CHANGES TO HIGH TEMPERATURE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND
ADDED STRONG DAMAGING WINDS-HAIL TO SOUTHERN THIRD OF FORECAST AREA TODAY.

300 AM EST THU MAR 1 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)... SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED IN WEST TN AND NRN MS...ASSOCIATED
WITH THE NOSE OF THE UPPER JET AND STRONG THETA-E ADVECTION JUST
NORTH OF THE SURFACE WARM FRONT. THIS CONVECTION WILL BEGIN TO
AFFECT OUR WESTERN COUNTIES BY 10Z. EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE TWO
MAIN SURGES OF PRECIP TODAY. THE FIRST WILL SOME DURING THE DAY AS
THE 850 MB JET STRENGTHENS AND ADVECTS WARM MOIST AIR OVER THE
SURFACE WARM FRONT. THE CONVECTION WILL BE ELEVATED DURING THE
DAY...AND THUS LESS LIKELY TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SEVERE
WEATHER...THOUGH SOME HAIL AND ISOLATED STRONG WIND GUSTS WILL BE
POSSIBLE. THE WARM FRONT WILL PUSH FROM SOUTH TO NORTH ACROSS THE
AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON...CAUSING SURFACE DEWPOINTS TO RISE
RAPIDLY INTO THE 50S. A SECOND ROUND OF PRECIP WILL COME WITH THE
PASSAGE OF THE SURFACE COLD FRONT BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z. THESE STORMS
WILL LIKELY BE IN THE FORM OF A SQUALL LINE AND WILL BE SURFACE-
BASED...AND THUS MORE LIKELY TO PRODUCE DAMAGING WIND GUSTS. AN
ISOALTED TORNADO CANNOT BE RULED OUT IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY. NAM
SBCAPE IN THE EVENING REACHES 500-700 J/KG...THOUGH THE SREF MEAN
SHOWS LESS INSTABILITY. HOWEVER NOT MUCH INSTABILITY WILL BE NEEDED
FOR SEVERE WX GIVEN THE STRONG DYNAMICAL FORCING. WILL ISSUE AN SPS
FOR THE SEVERE THREAT. THE WIND ADVISORY WILL BE CONTINUED FOR THE
MOUNTAINS. THE COLD FRONT CLEARS THE AREA BY 09Z AND WILL END ALL
POPS AROUND 12Z FRIDAY.

WITH THE CLOSED LOW REMAINING OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION AND THE 
FLOW ALOFT REMAINING WEST TO SOUTHWEST OVER OUR AREA...A STRONG 
SURGE OF COLD AIR DOES NOT FOLLOW THE FRONT...SO TEMPS WILL REMAIN 
ABOVE NORMAL FOR FRIDAY. A TROUGH ROTATES AROUND THE LOW AND WILL 
CROSS OUR AREA ON SATURDAY/SATURDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE REMAINS LIMITED 
WITH THE SYSTEM SO WILL KEEP POPS IN THS SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE RANGE. 
INCREASING COLD ADVECTION SATURDAY NIGHT MAY DROP TEMPS ENOUGH FOR A 
CHANGE TO SNOW IN THE NORTH BEFORE THE PRECIP ENDS. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...EASTERN STATES UPPER TROF 
MOVES OFFSHORE BY 12Z MONDAY ALLOWING FOR AN END TO THE 
FLURRIES/SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE SUNDAY MORNING. UPPER RIDGING 
BECOMES SUPPRESSED SOUTH INTO THE SUBTROPICS BY 00Z TUESDAY WITH 
ZONAL FLOW DEVELOPING. WEAK BACKDOOR FRONT TRIES TO DROP INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY WEDNESDAY WITH LITTLE IMPACT AS LOW LEVEL 
FLOW ACROSS SOUTHEAST STATES REMAINS EAST TO NORTHEASTERLY. STAYED 
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO SUGGESTED MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE DURING LONG 
TERM.

328 PM EST WED FEB 28 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...QUIET NOW BUT STORM
SYSTEM TRUDGING THIS WAY THAT SHOULD SPREAD PRECIP AND STORMS INTO
AREA TOMORROW AND TOMORROW NIGHT. EXPECTING WINDS TO PICK UP INTO
ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR TN/NC MOUNTAINS BOTH PRE-FRONTAL AND POST-
FRONTAL.

MOST OF PRECIP SHOULD BEGIN AS LIGHT RAIN...BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
SHOULD BE SURGING BACK INTO AREA THURSDAY...MAKING THURSDAY
AFTERNOON AND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AIRMASS UNSTABLE. INSTABILITY NOT
EXPECTED TO GET EXTREME...BUT COULD GET SOME SEVERE STORMS...WITH
MAIN THREAT BEING OUTFLOW WINDS.

HAVE NOT CHANGED MUCH FOR TEMPERATURES FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST AND
GUIDANCE.  

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...BASICALLY DRY PERIOD WITH 
THE EXCEPTION OF POSSIBLE WRAP AROUND FLOW FROM THE VERY INTENSE LOW 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT THAT PASSES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT.  THE 
MOST LIKELY TIME FOR THIS WRAP AROUND MOISTURE TO IMPACT THE 
FORECAST AREA IS SATURDAY NIGHT.  THE MODELS HAVE BEEN GOING BACK 
AND FORTH ON THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS MOISTURE FEEDING INTO THE 
REGION WITH THE CURRENT RUN BACKING OFF ON IT.  HAVE PLAYED THE 
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND LEFT THE PRECIPITATION IN FOR NOW BUT IF 
LATER RUNS CONTINUE THIS TREND...IT MAY NEED TO BE REMOVED.  

OTHER QUESTION IN THE PERIOD IS ON TUESDAY.  06Z GFS RUN INDICATED 
THE POSSIBILITY OF VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION ON TUESDAY BUT CURRENT 
RUN BRINGS THAT INTO QUESTION.  LEAVING THAT PERIOD DRY FOR NOW WITH 
SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUDINESS.  

NO REASON TO DEVIATE GREATLY FROM GFS TEMPERATURES SO WILL BE NEAR 
THEM FOR GUIDANCE.

300 PM EST WED FEB 28 2007


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...BASICALLY DRY PERIOD WITH 
THE EXCEPTION OF POSSIBLE WRAP AROUND FLOW FROM THE VERY INTENSE LOW 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT THAT PASSES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT.  THE 
MOST LIKELY TIME FOR THIS WRAP AROUND MOISTURE TO IMPACT THE 
FORECAST AREA IS SATURDAY NIGHT.  THE MODELS HAVE BEEN GOING BACK 
AND FORTH ON THE POSSIBILITY OF THIS MOISTURE FEEDING INTO THE 
REGION WITH THE CURRENT RUN BACKING OFF ON IT.  HAVE PLAYED THE 
MIDDLE OF THE ROAD AND LEFT THE PRECIPITATION IN FOR NOW BUT IF 
LATER RUNS CONTINUE THIS TREND...IT MAY NEED TO BE REMOVED.  

OTHER QUESTION IN THE PERIOD IS ON TUESDAY.  06Z GFS RUN INDICATED 
THE POSSIBILITY OF VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION ON TUESDAY BUT CURRENT 
RUN BRINGS THAT INTO QUESTION.  LEAVING THAT PERIOD DRY FOR NOW WITH 
SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUDINESS.  

NO REASON TO DEVIATE GREATLY FROM GFS TEMPERATURES SO WILL BE NEAR 
THEM FOR GUIDANCE.

.DISCUSSION...LOOKING AT THE HOURLY TEMPS FORECAST AND THE CURRENT 
OBS...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS ON TRACK.  VISIBLE SATELITE SHOWS 
VERY LIMITED CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE REGION.  NO CHANGES PLANNED TO 
CURRENT FORECAST.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE APPALACHIANS WILL SHIFT EAST TO THE
ATLANTIC COAST TODAY. PLENTY OF SUN ALONG WITH INCREASING WARM
ADVECTION WILL PUSH TEMPERATURES WELL INTO THE 60S IN MOST
SPOTS...WITH HIGHS AROUND 70 IN THE SOUTH. HIGH CLOUDS WILL BEGIN
TO INCREASE LATE IN THE DAY AS THE UPPER JET APPROACHES. ADVECTION
OF WARM MOIST AIR INCREASES RAPIDLY OVERNIGHT AS THE 850 MB JET
STRENGTHENS TO 50-60 KTS. LOW LEVEL DRY AIR IS OVERCOME BY THE
SOUTHERLY MOISTURE TRANSPORT BY 12Z...AND WILL INCREASE POPS
QUICKLY AROUND THIS TIME. INSTABILITY IS MAINLY ELEVATED THROUGH
MUCH OF THE DAY...BUT BECOMES MORE SURFACE BASED BY THE EVENING.
STRONG UPPER LEVEL FORCING ACTING ON WEAK INSTABILITY (LI -1 TO -3)
SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT FOR THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA
THURSDAY EVENING JUST AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. VERY STRONG SHEAR
AND STRONG WINDS ALOFT MAY PROVIDE A SLIGHT THREAT OF SEVERE
STORMS. THE GFS REMAINS SLIGHTLY FASTER IN PUSHING THE COLD FRONT
THROUGH THE AREA...HOWEVER BOTH MODELS PLACE THE COLD FRONT WELL
EAST OF OUR AREA BY 12Z FRIDAY...SO WILL REMOVE THE POPS FROM THE
NORTHEAST FRIDAY MORNING.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THE LARGE CLOSED LOW REMAINS OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION FRIDAY
NIGHT. AS THE LOW BEGINS TO MOVE EAST A TROUGH DIGS SOUTHWARD ON
SATURDAY. PVA AND COLD TEMPS ALOFT WILL PROVIDE A CHANCE OF PRECIP
FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...MAINLY IN NORTHERN
SECTIONS. MOISTURE IS LIMITED WITH THE SYSTEM AS THE FLOW ALOFT
REMAINS WESTERLY. A CHANGE TO SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE AS THE PRECIP
ENDS LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. HEIGHTS BEGINS TO RISE ON SUNDAY AS A
LARGE RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS...WHICH KEEPS THE
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST DRY.

THIS WILL CONTINUE THE ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WITH 
HIGHS EXPECTED TO REACH WELL INTO THE 60S THROUGH THE TN VALLEY.

BE LOCATED IN MO THURSDAY MORNING WITH AN EXPECTED WARM FRONT 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. THE COLD FRONT SHOULD STILL BE WEST OF THE 
MS RIVER EARLY IN THE MORNING. MOISTURE AND LIFT INCREASE 
DRAMATICALLY THURSDAY MORNING AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. PREFER THE 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER GFS WITH THE START TO PRECIPITATION THURSDAY. HIGHS 
WILL BE TRICKY WITH THE STRONG WARM ADVECTION AND TIMING OF 
PRECIPITATION. FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS. BOTH MODELS 
BRING FRONT THROUGH THE AREA BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z FRIDAY. STRONG 
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WINDS THURSDAY MAY REQUIRE A WIND ADVISORY OR 
WARNING FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS. BEST 
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE FROM LATE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING 
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. HEAVY RAIN IS POSSIBLE WITH THE HIGHEST 
AMOUNTS FORECAST FOR SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WHERE A COUPLE OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MS VALLEY THIS MORNING WILL SLIDE
TO THE EAST AND CROSS THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT. SOME MORNING
CLOUDS IN THE CENTRAL TN VALLEY ASSOCIATED WITH CHANNELED VORTICITY
AT 500 MB WILL DISSIPATE THIS MORNING AS THE VORT AXIS MOVES EAST.
TEMPS SHOULD WARM INTO THE 60S IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN
VALLEY...WITH 50S ELSEWHERE. BUILDING HEIGHTS ALOFT AND AN
INCREASING SOUTHERLY FLOW SHOULD PROVIDE EVEN WARMER TEMPERATURES
FOR WEDNESDAY...WELL INTO THE 60S IN MOST SPOTS OUTSIDE THE
MOUNTAINS AND APPROACHING 70 AT CHA.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
HIGH AND MIDLEVEL CLOUDS INCREASE WEDNESDAY EVENING WITH THE APPROACH
OF A STRENGTHENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS. A SOUTHERLY LOW
LEVEL JET WILL ADVECT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA LATE
WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY MORNING...AND WILL BRING SOME CHANCE POPS
INTO THE WEST BEFORE 12Z THURSDAY. INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT AND
UPPER DIVERGENCE WILL BRING POPS UP TO LIKELY AFTER 12Z...THEN
CATEGORICAL AFTER 18Z. INSTABILITY IS WEAK BUT SHEAR IS VERY
STRONG...THUS WILL HAVE JUST A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. THE GFS IS
SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE NAM TO BRING THE COLD FRONT THROUGH...BUT
IN EITHER CASE THE POPS WILL DROP QUICKLY AFTER 06Z AS MIDLEVEL
DRYING ENSUES. 

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH ROTATING AROUND THE DEEP CLOSED LOW OVER THE
GREAT LAKES WILL SWING THROUGH THE AREA ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY
NIGHT. MOISTURE IS FAIRLY LIMITED WITH THE SYSTEM BUT A STRONG VORT
AXIS AND UPPER JET DYNAMICS SHOULD PRODUCE AT LEAST A CHANCE OF
PRECIP...WITH RAIN ON SATURDAY AND RAIN OR SNOW SATURDAY NIGHT. A
LARGE RIDGE WILL KEEP THE AREA DRY THROUGH THE REST OF THE FORECAST.

BANDS OF MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA.  HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN OVERNIGHT FOR CONTINUED TRANQUIL WEATHER THROUGH THE SHORT

FRONT COMBINATION MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE REGION THURSDAY INTO

POSSIBLE THURSDAY NIGHT IN ADVANCE OF THE COLD FRONT.  

NEXT WEATHER MAKER SATURDAY NIGHT. THE COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY WILL
USHER IN SOME COLD AIR AND THE UPPER LOW THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH
THE COLD FRONT WILL BRING A GOOD SHOT OF WRAP AROUND MOISTURE INTO
THE REGION ON SATURDAY NIGHT WITH A CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION. AT
THIS TIME HAVE WORDED AS RAIN OR SNOW BUT IF ANY PRECIPITATION
FALLS IT WILL MORE LIKELY BE IN THE FORM OF SNOW. THE BIGGER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOISTURE TRAPPED BELOW A MIDLEVEL 
INVERSION IS RESULTING IN A STRATOCU DECK ACROSS THE AREA THIS 
MORNING. ACARS SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THIS CLOUD DECK IS NOT VERY 
THICK...ABOUT 1000-1500 FEET. THE MODELS DO SHOW SOME MIDLEVEL DRY 
ADVECTION WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE AREA AFTER SUNRISE...SO EXPECT 
THAT THIS CLOUD DECK WILL DISSIPATE AROUND THAT TIME. CONSIDERABLE 
HIGH CLOUDINESS OVER THE CENTRAL US ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER JET 
AND SOME CHANNELED VORTICITY WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA BY THE 
AFTERNOON...GIVING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES. THE VORT AXIS CROSSES THE 
NORTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA TONIGHT...BUT PRODUCES NO LIFT...AND 
MOISTURE IS LACKING OUTSIDE OF A THIN MIDLEVEL LAYER. WILL REMOVE 
THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN ON 
TUESDAY...BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. A FRONT 
APPROACHES ON LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR OUR WESTERN ZONES FOR LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  BEST CHANCES SHOULD 
HOLD OFF UNTIL THURSDAY WHEN BETTER MOISTURE AND LIFT PUSHES IN WITH 
IT.  50-6KT LOW LEVEL JET IS ALSO EXPECTED ON THURSDAY ALONG WITH 
SOME WEAK INSTABILITY...WILL ADD THUNDER TO THE FORECAST FOR 
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY EVENING.  FRONT LINGERS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT... 
WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT.  SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR 
ALL LIQUID PRECIPITATION.  THE FRONT IS EAST OF THE AREA ON FRIDAY 
WITH MOISTURE DECREASING BEHIND IT.  WITH UPPER LOW NEARBY...WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS IN FOR FRIDAY WITH BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  
UPPER LOW TRACKS NORTH ON FRIDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP FRIDAY NIGHT AND

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
300 PM EST SUN FEB 25 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE FORECAST AREA...GENERALLY ALONG 
A MIDDLESBORO TO KNOXVILLE TO CLEVELAND LINE. CURRENT LOCAL RADARS 
ARE DEVOID OF ANY CONVECTION...BUT LATEST MSAS DATA INDICATES THAT 
SOME WEAK INSTABILITY IS DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THIS FRONT ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. THUS...THINK THAT SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE LATER THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE THIS 
COLD FRONT COMPLETELY EXITS THE AREA. BREEZY SOUTHWEST WINDS ALONG 
THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD DIMINISH RAPIDLY AFTER SUNSET...AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BEGINS TO BUILD INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE FRONT. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION WILL 
CONTINUE TO ROTATE CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND MONDAY. 
A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE ON MONDAY NIGHT WILL THEN CREATE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SOME LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...TRENDED WARMER ON MONDAY WITH 
SOUTHWEST FLOW EXPECTED AND COOLER ON TUESDAY WITH NORTHWEST FLOW 
EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL FOR 
WEDNESDAY. NEXT SYSTEM OF CONCERN REACHES IN LATE THURSDAY/THURSDAY 
NIGHT. MODEL CONSISTENCY HAS BEEN POOR WITH HANDLING OF THIS 
SYSTEM...ESPECIALLY IN TIMING. THEREFORE...CONFIDENCE IS LOW AND 
WILL KEEP POPS AT CHANCE CATEGORY THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT WITH 
DECREASING POPS FRIDAY. UPPER LOW REMAINS POSITIONED WELL TO OUR 
NORTH SATURDAY AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP STAYS NORTH AS WELL WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING IN SUNDAY...SO WILL KEEP THINGS DRY FOR THE 
WEEKEND.

915 AM EST SUN FEB 25 2007

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER WESTERN TN WITH A 
LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS OCCURRING ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. EARLIER SURFACE OBS FROM CROSSVILLE AND CALLS TO THE 
SMOKIES REVEAL THAT STRONG DAMAGING WINDS OCCURRED OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS EARLIER THIS MORNING...BUT THE CONVECTION THIS MORNING 
WAS EVIDENTLY NOT DEEP ENOUGH TO DESCEND THESE WINDS INTO THE 
VALLEYS. MODELS REVEAL THAT THESE STRONG 850 MB WINDS WILL MOVE EAST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA BY MID MORNING...SO WILL PLAN TO CANCEL THE 
WIND ADVISORY AND HIGH WIND WARNING THIS MORNING (ALTHOUGH BREEZY 
WINDS WILL CONTINUE THIS AFTERNOON BUT REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY 
CRITERIA). THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO BE ON THE PLATEAU BY MID 
AFTERNOON...WITH THE WRF MODEL INDICATING A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THE GFS MODEL IS NOT AS 
UNSTABLE...BUT FEEL THAT CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT SHOULD OCCUR THIS 
AFTERNOON WITH CLEARING SKIES NOTED AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT ON 
SATELLITE IMAGES (WHICH WILL PROVIDE GOOD AFTERNOON HEATING). TSTORM 
COVERAGE THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD BE MORE SCATTERED IN COVERAGE...AND 
THINK THAT SOME HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH A FEW 
OF THE STRONGEST STORMS. WILL ALSO PLAN TO RAISE MAXES FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON SINCE MINS WERE WARMER THAN EXPECTED THIS MORNING...AND A 
WARM SOUTHWEST WIND FLOW ALONG WITH AT LEAST PARTIAL SUNSHINE ARE 
EXPECTED FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

225 PM EST SAT FEB 24 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM STRENGTHENING OVER THE 
PLAINS...WITH HIGH PRESSURE ENTRENCHED ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD. 
MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE PROGRESSION OF THIS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TONIGHT...WITH THE BULK OF THE PRECIP NOT EXPECTED 
UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT AND PROBABLY MORE TOWARDS SUNRISE. WRF MODEL 
CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL NOT COMPLETELY EXIT 
THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THIS SEEMS REASONABLE 
TO EXPECT SINCE A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS WILL 
BECOME NEGATIVELY-TILTED TONIGHT...LIKELY RESULTING IN A SLOWER 
EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS SYSTEM. BOTH MODELS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP 
A STRONG 850 MB JET (BETWEEN 50 AND 70 KTS) AFTER MIDNIGHT 
TONIGHT...AND WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY (AND HIGH WIND 
WARNING ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS) TO ACCOUNT FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF 
THESE STRONG WINDS DESCENDING DOWN INTO THE VALLEYS BY CONVECTION 
LATER TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. STRONG WINDS WILL BE A CERTAINTY 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET...BUT HIGHER WINDS IN 
THE VALLEYS WILL DEPEND ON HOW STRONG THE LINE OF CONVECTION LATER 
TONIGHT REMAINS AS IT ENTERS THE FORECAST AREA. SURFACE-BASED 
INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT APPEARS WEAK AT BEST FOR THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE INDICATING SOME 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY. IN FACT...A LARGE AMOUNT OF ELECTRICAL 
ACTIVITY HAS DEVELOPED WAY AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT OVER THE WESTERN 
TN RIVER VALLEY WHERE ELEVATED INSTABILITY RESIDES AS WELL...SO 
THINK THAT THERE MAY BE A LITTLE MORE COVERAGE OF TSTORMS LATER 
TONIGHT. SURFACE-BASED INSTABILITY INCREASES ON SUNDAY...ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA. WILL MENTION ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE REDEVELOPMENT 
ON SUNDAY...WITH SOME HAIL POSSIBLE SINCE THE FREEZING LEVEL WILL BE 
LOW. HOWEVER...TSTORM COVERAGE ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON SHOULD BE MORE 
SCATTERED IN COVERAGE. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH 
SLOWLY PULLS AWAY FROM THE REGION ON TUESDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING IN ON WEDNESDAY. TIMING OF NEXT SYSTEM REMAINS IN QUESTION 
BUT SHOULD AFFECT THE AREA THURSDAY TO FRIDAY. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS 
FOR THIS PERIOD WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCE THURSDAY NIGHT. PRECIP 
SHOULD BE ALL RAIN BUT AIR MASS DOES BECOME SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AND 
MAY NEED TO ADD THUNDER AS DETAILS BECOME MORE CLEAR WITH FUTURE 
MODEL RUNS. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER

CURRENT RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION WITH LIGHTNING 
STRIKES OVER NORTHERN AL AND SOUTHERN MIDDLE TN...ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
OLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY (WHICH EXTENDS INTO SOUTHEAST TN) AND SOME 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY ABOVE 700 MB. AREA SOUNDINGS ALSO REVEAL SOME 
OF THIS ELEVATED INSTABILITY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL PLAN

ACROSS THE SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA TO ACCOUNT FOR 
THIS CONVECTION. WILL ALSO MENTION INCREASING CLOUDINESS EVERYWHERE 
AS CLOUDS GRADUALLY INCREASE FROM THE MS RIVER VALLEY. SOUTHERLY 
WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS

317 AM EST SAT FEB 24 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MIDLEVEL CLOUDS WILL INCREASE 
THROUGH THE DAY AS THE RIDGE AXIS ALOFT SHIFTS EAST AND THE CLOSED 
LOW OVER THE PLAINS APPROACHES. A VERY STRONG SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL 
JET ON THE ORDER OF 60-70 KTS AT 850 MB WILL PROVIDE ADVECTION OF 
WARM MOIST AIR INTO THE AREA TONIGHT. THIS WARM ADVECTION PATTERN 
WITH A STRONG LLJ TENDS TO PRODUCE VERY HIGH WINDS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS...AND WILL ISSUE A HIGH WIND WATCH FROM 9 PM TONIGHT UNTIL 
NOON SUNDAY. EXPECT THAT A WIND ADVISORY WILL BE NEEDED FOR AT LEAST 
THE PLATEAU AND SW VA TONIGHT...AND PERHAPS THE VALLEY TOO...BUT 
WILL LEAVE THIS FOR THE DAY SHIFT AS IT WILL BE WELL INTO THE SECOND 
PERIOD BEFORE THE WINDS PICK UP. THE GFS BRINGS PRECIP INTO THE AREA 
FASTER THAN THE NAM...BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE RELATED TO CONVECTIVE 
FEEDBACK PROBLEMS FROM THE CONVECTION TO OUR WEST. WILL BRING POPS 
UP THROUGH THE EVENING...BUT CATEGORICAL POPS HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. DOWNSLOPING EFFECTS MAY HOLD PRECIP BACK EVEN LONGER IN NE 
TN/SW VA. THERE APPEARS TO BE A DISCONNECT BETWEEN THE STRONGEST 
DYNAMICAL LIFT AND THE BEST 
INSTABILITY...WHICH WILL PREVENT A WIDESPREAD SEVERE WEATHER EVENT 
IN OUR AREA. THE STRONGEST LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND UPPER 
DIFFLUENCE OCCUR AROUND 12Z...BUT INSTABILITY IS VERY LIMITED AT 
THIS TIME AND IS MAINLY ELEVATED. LAPSE RATES STEEPEN IN THE 
AFTERNOON AS TEMPS COOL ALOFT AND THE DRY SLOT MOVES 
OVERHEAD...HOWEVER THE WINDS ALOFT BECOME MUCH WEAKER. THE GREATEST 
THREAT FOR DAMAGING WINDS IS MOST LIKELY LATE TONIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING 
WHEN LOW-TOPPED SHOWERS COULD PULL THE STRONG WINDS ALOFT DOWN TO 
THE SURFACE. LOW WET-BULB ZERO HEIGHTS AND STEEP LAPSE RATES MAY 
GIVE A SMALL THREAT OF HAIL SUNDAY AFTERNOON BUT THUNDERSTORM 
COVERAGE IS EXPECTED TO BE SCATTERED.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER LOW TRACKS 
THROUGH THE OH VALLEY ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...WILL KEEP LOW 
CHANCES FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND INTO MONDAY MORNING.  BEST CHANCES 
WILL REMAIN ACROSS OUR NORTHERN ZONES WHERE DEEPEST MOISTURE 
RESIDES. THICKNESSES INDICATE SOME SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT AND MONDAY MORNING.  UPPER LOW SHIFTS NORTH ON MONDAY NIGHT 
PULLING MOST OF THE MOISTURE NORTH... WILL KEEP TUESDAY DRY.  WEAK 
SHORTWAVE ROTATES AROUND THE UPPER LOW AS IT SHIFTS EAST ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT.  MOISTURE LIMITED...SO WILL KEEP WEDNESDAY DRY.  A FRONT 
APPROACHES ON THURSDAY AND LINGERS INTO FRIDAY...WILL KEEP CHANCE 
POPS FOR BOTH DAYS.  SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL LIQUID

330 PM EST FRI FEB 23 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN 
PART OF THE NATION...WITH A VERY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE PROGRESSION OF THE 
NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ON SATURDAY...BUT ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW 
SOME DIFFERENCES BY SUNDAY. WRF MODEL REVEALS A SLOWER PROGRESSION 
OF THE COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY...WITH ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE 
REDEVELOPMENT LATER IN THE DAY ON SUNDAY. FEEL THAT THIS WRF 
SOLUTION IS BETTER THAN THE FASTER GFS SOLUTION...SINCE BOTH THE GFS 
AND WRF MODELS INDICATE THAT A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE 
PLAINS WILL BECOME NEGATIVELY-TILTED ON SATURDAY NIGHT. AS A 
RESULT...THINK THAT THIS NEGATIVELY-TILTED TROUGH WILL CAUSE THE 
SYSTEM TO MOVE SLOWER TO THE EAST ON SUNDAY. RIGHT NOW IT STILL 
APPEARS THAT THE MAIN BAND OF CONVECTION WILL MOVE THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT...BUT SCATTERED 
SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING BEFORE 
THIS MAIN PRECIP BAND ARRIVES. BOTH MODELS CONTINUE TO REVEAL A 
STRONG 850 MB JET (BETWEEN 50 AND 70 KTS) AFTER MIDNIGHT ON SATURDAY 
NIGHT. INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT APPEARS WEAK AT BEST 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...AND EXPECT THE CONVECTION OVER THE MS 
RIVER VALLEY TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EAST SATURDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER... 
STRONG GUSTY WINDS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THIS WEAKENING 
CONVECTIVE LINE AS IT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
INSTABILITY ACTUALLY INCREASES ON SUNDAY AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. WILL PLAN TO MENTION ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE 
REDEVELOPMENT ON SUNDAY...WITH THE IDEA THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL NOT 
YET BE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO SPIN TO 
OUR NORTH...WRAPPING IN SOME CLOUDS AND POSSIBLY A STRAY SHOWERS 
OVER NORTHERN ZONES ON MONDAY. THE LOW SHIFTS EAST ON TUESDAY WITH A

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER CANADA 
EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN PART OF THE NATION. 
SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL SOME HIGH CLOUDS DRIFTING ACROSS THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE 
DRIFTING ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. WINDS WILL BE LIGHTER AND LESS GUSTY 
THAN YESTERDAY...MAINLY 10 TO 20 MPH. DEWPOINTS WILL DROP AGAIN AS 
DRY AIR ALOFT MIXES TO THE SURFACE...BUT THE DROP SHOULD NOT BE AS 
DRAMATIC AS YESTERDAY DUE TO THE LIGHTER WINDS AND MORE UNIFORM 
BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE. EXPECT AFTERNOON RH VALUES AROUND 20%. 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE WINDS WILL APPROACH 20 MPH COULD HAVE 
ELEVATED FIRE DANGER TODAY AND WILL HEADLINE THIS IN THE FWF. SKIES 
WILL BE CLEAR MOST OF THE DAY...WITH INCREASING CIRRUS EXPECTED IN 
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS THE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS MOVES 
OVERHEAD. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...RIDGE SHIFTS TO THE EAST ON 
SATURDAY.  DRY CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL BUT CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN 
MOVING IN AHEAD A FRONT TRACKING IN ON SATURDAY NIGHT.  FRONT BRINGS 
AMPLE MOISTURE AND LIFT AHEAD OF IT.  GOOD DIFFLUENCE ALOFT ALONG 
WITH A 60-70 KT LOW LEVEL JET WILL ENHANCE LIFT...WILL BUMP UP POPS 
TO 80 PERCENT FOR SATURDAY NIGHT.  FAIRLY STABLE AIRMASS BY THE TIME 
THE FRONT REACHES OUR CWA ON SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT WITH THE STRONG 
SHEAR...MAY STILL SEE SOME SEVERE STORMS MOVING THROUGH.  FRONT 
TRACKS EAST OF AREA ON SUNDAY...BUT MAY STILL A PRETTY GOOD COVERAGE 
EARLY SUNDAY...WILL KEEP LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SUNDAY 
MORNING...THEN LESSER CHANCES BY AFTERNOON.  UPPER LOW TRACKS 
THROUGH THE OH VALLEY ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...WILL KEEP LOW 
CHANCES FOR OUR NORTHERN ZONES...THICKNESSES INDICATE THEY MAY SEE 
SOME SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  UPPER LOW SHIFTS NORTH ON 
MONDAY NIGHT PULLING MOST OF THE MOISTURE NORTH...WILL KEEP MONDAY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE CAROLINAS...WITH BREEZY WEST 
TO NORTHWEST WINDS CONTINUING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THESE WINDS 
SHOULD QUICKLY DECREASE AFTER SUNSET AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS 
THE REGION. WITH BREEZY WINDS...DRY RHS AND LOW FUEL MOISTURE 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE AN SPS TO ADDRESS THE 
POTENTIAL HIGH FIRE DANGER UNTIL SUNSET. A STRONG COLD FRONT IS 
PROGGED TO APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH BOTH THE 
GFS AND WRF MODELS INDICATING THE BULK OF THE PRECIP AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THIS FRONT APPEARS WEAK FOR THE FORECAST 
AREA...ALTHOUGH A STRONG 850 MB JET (IN EXCESS OF 50 KTS) IS PROGGED 
TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT. AS A RESULT OF THESE HIGH 
WINDS...THINK THERE WILL STILL BE A POSSIBILITY OF SOME SEVERE 
WEATHER LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL MENTION ONLY A CHANCE FOR 
TSTORMS AT THIS TIME...SINCE THE OVERALL AIR MASS APPEARS TO BE 
STABLE...BUT FEEL SOME ELEVATED THUNDER WILL BE POSSIBLE. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WIDESPREAD SHOWERS WITH A 
POSSIBLE STRAY THUNDERSTORM WILL EXIT THE AREA ON SUNDAY.  A FEW 
ISOLATED SHOWERS MAY LINGER OVER THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY 
MONDAY MORNING...MAINLY OVER THE FAR NORTHEAST ZONES.  CONFIDENCE IS 
LOW FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD DUE TO POOR CONSISTENCY.  
HOWEVER...A WEAK IMPULSE MAY SLIDE ACROSS THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT.  
FOR NOW...WILL LEAVE DRY WITH JUST A SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUD 
COVER.  HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WITH THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...DRY WEATHER REGIME 
RETURNS AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. MAIN CONCERN IS WINDS IN THE FIRST PERIOD AND EARLY 
SECOND AS GRADIENT BETWEEN AMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN 
GREAT LAKES AND APPROACHING UPPER RIDGE INCREASES NORTHWEST FLOW. 
APPEARS WINDS OVER NORTHEASTERN MOUNTAINS WILL REACH ADVISORY 
CRITERIA...AND SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA COUNTIES WILL REACH LAKE WIND 
ADVISORY CRITERIA. ANTICIPATE WINDS TO DECREASE DURING THE SECOND 
PERIOD. GFS GUIDANCE TEMPS APPEAR REASONABLE AND GENERALLY DID NOT 
STRAY FAR FROM THOSE VALUES.

PATCHY DENSE FOG THIS MORNING ACROSS PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA
...ALTHO CERTAINLY NOT NEARLY AS WIDESPREAD AS NOTED ACROSS CENTRAL
AND ERN KY. WILL COVER THIS PATCHY FOG IN SHORT TERM FORECASTS.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES
SEEM GENERALLY CONSISTENT AND IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH THE DEEP
TROUGH AND STRONGER COLD FRONT TO AFFECT THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT
INTO SUNDAY. TEMPTED TO PLAY UP THE THUNDERSTORMS A BIT MORE IN THE
GRIDS...BUT WILL LET LATER SHIFTS ADD AREAL QUALIFIER (SCATTERED)
IF NEEDED. WE WILL CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT AT LEAST A FEW STRONG
THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE SATURDAY EVENING IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER
OUTLOOK (MEMHWOMRX). DID SHOW A SLIGHT DECREASING POP TREND IN THE
FORECAST GRIDS FROM THE WEST STARTING SUNDAY AFTERNOON. OTHERWISE
...JUST VERY SLIGHT TEMP ADJUSTMENTS IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...DRY FORECAST CARRIED ON FOR MONDAY
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...ALTHO A TRACE PRECIPITATION EVENT MIGHT OCCUR
IN THE FAR NE AREAS MONDAY OR TUESDAY BEHIND THE EXITING STRONG LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM. MAX TEMP PATTERN STILL LOOKS TO BE NEAR OR
SLIGHTLY BELOW CLIMO NORMS SW VA/NE TN TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE FOR SE TN
AND SW NC. ENSEMBLES AND VARIOUS MODELS START TO STRAY FROM ANY
DEFINITIVE PATTERN FOR THESE PERIODS...SO I OPTED NOT TO BLINDLY
POPULATE TEMP FIELDS WITH THE LATEST GFSX MOS NUMBERS. INSTEAD
STAYED SOMEWHAT TRUE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS...WITH MINOR ADJUSTMENTS AS
NEEDED TO MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS.  

NEW DAY 7 (THURSDAY)...FOR NOW...INDICATES POSSIBLE SYSTEM QUITE
SIMILAR TO SUNDAYS. THUS...INTRODUCED AS INCREASING CLOUDS AND

OCCURRING AHEAD OF IT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONT HASNT 
MADE MUCH SOUTHWARD PROGRESS TODAY...AND THINK THAT IT WILL CONTINUE

THINK THAT IT WILL BE ISOLATED IN COVERAGE WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME 
HEATING. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
TOMORROW MORNING...BRINGING BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS BY THE AFTERNOON 
BUT NOT MUCH OF A CHANGE IN TEMPS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS 
THE REGION FOR MOST OF THE DAY ON THURSDAY AND INTO FRIDAY. AS FOR 
TEMPS...ALL THREE SETS OF GUIDANCE ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND LOOK 
REASONABLE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY) VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE TROUGH APPROACHING THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FROM THE WEST IS CURRENTLY GENERATING
SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. TROUGH AXIS
PROJECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA BY LATE MORNING TAKING THE BULK
OF THE PRECIP WITH IT. WILL CONTINUE TO INDICATE A LESSENING POP
TREND WITH TIME FROM WEST TO EAST. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STAYED
CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE.

LIGHTNING STRIKES DIMINISHING AND SURFACE BASED LIFTED INDICES
BECOMING POSITIVE...BUT A FEW THUNDERSTORMS LINGER (PROBABLY SOME
ELEVATED INSTABILITY). A REPORT OF SMALL HAIL RECEIVED FROM MORGAN
COUNTY...SO AN SPS WAS ISSUED TO COVER THIS POSSIBILITY WITH
ACTIVITY ACROSS NRN PLATEAU. OTHERWISE...DOUBTFUL IF ANY
THUNDERSTORMS WILL REMAIN BY 6AM EST...SO SHORT TERM FORECAST WILL
BE USED FOR ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS EARLY THIS MORNING RATHER THAN
IN ZFPMRX.

.LONG TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT MAY EASE
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA...OR BECOME SO DIFFUSE THAT IT WILL BE
DIFFICULT TO LOCATE IT BY THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...DID ADD A SLIGHT
CHANCE OF SHOWERS EARLY THIS EVENING FOR THE NRN AND SMOKY MTNS OF
EAST TN. NOT MUCH IF ANY COLD AIR ADVECTION NOTED...SO NUDGED MIN
TEMPS UP A BIT IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS.

RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE STILL LOOKS TO BUILD IN AND DOMINATE
THURSDAY THRU SATURDAY...SO JUST SOME SLIGHT TEMPERATURE
ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO GRIDS. NORTHERLY SURFACE WINDS MAY BRING DOWN
HIGHS TEMPS SLIGHTLY ON FRIDAY...BEFORE SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW
DEVELOPS AGAIN ON SATURDAY AHEAD OF THE STRONGER COLD FRONT FOR THE
WEEKEND. TIMING OF CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION...INCLUDING SOME
THUNDERSTORMS...APPEARED ON TRACK FOR SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.

DECREASED POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT LEADING INTO OUR DRY FORECAST FOR
MONDAY. DONT SEE A SIGNIFICANT THREAT OF PRECIPITATION TUESDAY...
ALTHO A FEW RAIN OR SNOW SHOWERS MIGHT BE POSSIBLE DUE TO COLD AIR
ADVECTION AND LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW. ADDED SOME PRELIMINARY GRIDS
FOR THE NEW DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY)...WHICH LOOKS TO BE DRY WITH
TEMPERATURES NEAR SEASONAL NORMALS IN THE NORTH AND AROUND 5 TO 8
DEGREES ABOVE IN THE SOUTH.

316 AM EST TUE FEB 20 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...VERY INTERESTING CURRENT 
TEMPERATURE PATTERN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...VARYING FROM CHILLY 
20S WHERE WINDS DECOUPLED AND SKIES HAVE REMAINED MOSTLY CLEAR TO
MID AND UPPER 40S ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND IN THE CENTRAL 
AND SRN VALLEY WHERE SW WINDS OF 7 TO 15 MPH ARE BLOWING. LOW CLOUD 
DECK AROUND 5000 FEET IS ADVANCING NE FROM MIDDLE TN/NRN AL AND NW GA
THIS MORNING...SO TEMPS MAY ACTUALLY RISE BY DAYBREAK IN THE CHIILY 
AREAS. AREA RADARS ARE SHOWING SOME WEAK RETURNS SPREADING NE INTO 
THE SW HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT IT SHOULD BE EXTREMELY 
DIFFICULT FOR MORE THAN A SPRINKLE TO REACH THE SURFACE EARLY THIS 
MORNING...GIVEN MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS AND CURRENT DEW POINT TEMPS 
ONLY IN THE TEENS AND 20S.

FOR THE FORECAST...SLIGHTLY DELAYED THE ONSET OF ANY SIGNIFICANT 
PRECIPITATION UNTIL MID TO LATE AFTERNOON...WHEN MY POPS BUILD TO 
LIKELY CATEGORY. CURRENT TEMPS WERE SO MILD WHERE MIXING IS OCCURING 
THAT I WENT WITH OR JUST ABOVE THE WARMER MOS CHOICES. KEPT AS 
SHOWERS FOR TYPE TODAY. HOWEVER...LOOKS TO BE SOME UPPER LEVEL 
SUPPORT WITH JET MAX PROVIDING UPPER LEVEL DIVERGENCE THIS EVENING 
AND SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY. BEST LIFT SEEMS TO FALL AROUND 00Z TO 
06Z PERIOD ALSO...SO I ADDED ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS TO WESTERN HALF 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. PREVIOUS CATEGORICAL POPS THIS EVENING ALSO 
LOOK GOOD...WITH POPS DECREASING AFTER MIDNIGHT. WENT CLOSER TO A 
MOS BLEND FOR LOWS TONIGHT WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.


.LONG TERM...(WED THROUGH MON)...SHORT WAVE TROUGH THAT PRODUCES 
LATE TUESDAY PRECIP EVENT RAPIDLY PULLS AWAY DURING THE THIRD 
PERIOD...TAKING PRECIP WITH IT. UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK. THIS WILL ALLOW 
TEMPS TO CLIMB TO ABOVE CLIMO THROUGH THE BULK OF THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD. DRY WEATHER WILL ALSO PERSIST UNTIL SUNDAY WHEN AN AMPLIFIED 
UPPER TROUGH/CLOSED LOW ADVANCES EASTWARD FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE FAIRLY CLOSELY FOR BOTH TEMPS AND POPS AS 
ENSEMBLES GENERALLY SUPPORT ITS SOLUTION THROUGH THE PERIOD.

SHIFTING EAST TONIGHT.  MODELS BRINGING FRONT INTO THE REGION LATE 
TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  GFS A BIT QUICKER THAN NAM ON BRINGING THE 
DEEPER MOISTURE IN AHEAD OF IT.  WITH THE DRY LOWER LEVELS...WENT

LATE TONIGHT AND DRY ELSEWHERE.  LOW TEMPERATURES TONIGHT/TUESDAY

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
407 AM EST MON FEB 19 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WIND AND SUNSHINE YESTERDAY LIKELY 
MELTED MOST OF OUR SNOW COVER...EXCEPT FOR NORTHEAST AREAS WHERE 
CLOUDS HELD IN LONGER AND HEAVIER SNOW FELL. UNDERCUT MOS HIGHS SOME 
IN AREAS WHERE LAST VISIBLE SATELLITE PICS AND SNOW COVER GRAPHICS 
INDICATED MORE LEFTOVER SNOW COVER FOR TODAY. GOOD LOW LEVEL WARM 
AIR ADVECTION COMES IN WITH INCREASING SW WINDS THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
WITH LITTLE TO NO SNOW COVER OVER NRN AL OR NW GA...THE SRN VALLEY 
COUNTIES SHOULD WARM NICELY INTO THE MID TO UPPER 50S.

OTHERWISE...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AT THE 
SURFACE WILL SLIP SOUTHEAST AND SURFACE GRADIENT WILL INCREASE AHEAD 
OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. THINKING IS THAT GFS MAY BE A LITTLE 
TOO FAST WITH INCREASING CLOUDS TONIGHT...AND TOO ZEALOUS WITH 
DEVELOPMENT OF LIGHT RAIN. THUS...KEPT JUST THE VERY SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR EXTREME WRN COUNTIES LATE TONIGHT...AND DRY ELSEWHERE.

MIN TEMPS WILL BE TRICKY GIVEN THE INCREASING CLOUDS LATE AND SW 
SURFACE WINDS NOT DECOUPLING IN ALL AREAS AFTER SUNSET. COOLER GFS 
MOS MINS LOOKED BEST FOR ERN AREAS WHERE WINDS WILL BE LIGHTEST AND 
CLOUDS ARRIVE LAST...AND A BLEND WITH THE MILDER NAM-WRF MOS MINS 
ELSEWHERE. 

PATTERN CHANGING AND TEMPS WARMING FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK LOOKS 
GREAT...EXCEPT PERHAPS TO FANS OF WINTER WEATHER.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS BRING WEAK SYSTEM
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY. THERE IS SOME WEAK INSTABILITY
WITH THE SYSTEM AND GOOD SHEAR. NAM SHOWS STRONG LIFT AND ABUNDANT
MOISTURE BUT GFS DOES NOT HAVE THE MOISTURE AND BEST LIFT AT THE
SAME TIME. DECIDED NOT TO PUT THUNDER IN WITH DEW POINTS ONLY
REACHING THE MID 40S IN THE SOUTH AND INCONSISTENCIES BETWEEN THE
MODELS. SOUTHWEST WINDS THOUGH WILL HELP THE TEMPERATURES WARM
EVEN WITH ANTICIPATED SHOWERS. PREFERRED THE WARMER MAV NUMBERS.
BOTH NAM/GFS BRING FRONT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT WITH SKIES CLEARING
QUICKLY WEDNESDAY. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE WITH RIDGING
ALOFT WILL HELP TEMPERATURES RISE INTO THE 60S THROUGH THE END OF
THE WEEK. A DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE MS
VALLEY SATURDAY AND OPEN THE GULF. STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION WILL
CAUSE SHOWERS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE TENNESEE VALLEY SATURDAY
THROUGH SUNDAY. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH SUNDAY AND
THUNDERSTORMS MAY OCCUR AHEAD OF IT. CURRENT GFS MODEL RUN IS
SPEEDING SYSTEM UP SEVERAL HOURS WHICH MAY MEAN FRONT MOVES THROUGH
EARLIER BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP TIMING THE SAME.

1145 AM EST SUN FEB 18 2007

.DISCUSSION...UPDATED FORECAST TO DROP SNOW WARNINGS IN TN MNTS.
FORECAST ADJUSTED TO REDUCE CLOUD COVER AND LOWER SNOW CHC. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
.SHORT TERM...(TODAY)...MOST INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IS 
LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES ON BACK SIDE OF THE EXITING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM. HAD THOUGHT BRIEFLY ABOUT ENDING ADVISORIES AND 
WARNINGS OVER WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY (INSTEAD OF 
7AM EST ENDING TIME)...BASED ON MODEL DATA AND LATEST RADAR OR 
SATELLITE PICS. HOWEVER...AFTER A FEW CALLS MADE TO THOSE COUNTIES 
(ESPECIALLY NRN PLATEAU AND SEQUATCHIE VALLEY COUNTIES)...SEEMS THAT 
THE SNOW MAY BE JUST A LITTLE MORE WIDESPREAD AND AT LEAST LIGHT 
INTENSITY THAN AREA RADAR LOOPS WOULD INDICATE. ANOTHER FACTOR THAT 
FAVORS CONTINUING THE PREVIOUS ENDING TIMES LATER THIS MORNING...IS 
THE VERY HAZARDOUS ROAD CONDITIONS NOTED GENERALLY ACROSS MOST IF 
NOT ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING.

OTHERWISE...WILL CONTINUE TO SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT THE GFS MOS MAX TEMPS 
FOR TODAY...GIVEN TRACK RECORD OVER PAST FEW DAYS AND DECENT AMOUNT 
OF SNOW COVER IN MANY AREAS. KEPT POP GRIDS CLOSE TO PREVIOUS 
FORECAST AND WELL ABOVE 18/00Z MOS...BASED ON RADAR AND CALLS MADE.
WAS A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT STRENGTH OF W-NW SURFACE WINDS TODAY...
BUT KMRX AND KHTX VAD WIND PROFILES (VWPS) SHOW LOW LEVEL JET 
DECREASING TO 25 KNOTS. WIND GRIDS FOR TODAY WERE FRESHENED WITH THE 
NAM12 MODEL DATA...WHICH MIGHT BE A TAD HIGH ON SPEEDS...BUT DID 
MESH WELL WITH NEIGHBORING WIND SPEEDS TO OUR EAST FROM GSP AND 
RNK.  

.LONG TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...AFTER PRECIPITATION ENDS
GFS IS QUICK TO CLEAR CLOUD COVER WITH NAM/WRF HOLDING ONTO THE LOW
LEVEL CLOUDINESS MOST OF THE NIGHT IN THE NE AS FLOW FROM THE NW
CONTINUES TO BRING IN FEED OF MOISTURE. THINKING THAT CLOUDS MAY BE
STUBBORN AND CONTINUE NORTHERN HALF. ANOTHER FACTOR IN LOW
TEMPERATURE FORECAST IS STRONG NW TO W WINDS THAT SHOULOD DROP OFF
DURING THE EVENING AS PRESSURE GRADIENT RELAXES. GUIDANCE VALUES FOR
TONIGHT ARE MOSTLY IN THE 20S. WENT BELOW GUIDANCE SEVERAL DEGREES
NE WITH SNOW COVER ON THE GROUND AND ANTICIPATED CLEARING BEFORE
MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE MOVING EAST ALONG THE GULF COAST AND COLD
UPPER TROUGH EXITING TO THE NE WILL HELP THE REGION WARM UP INTO
THE 40S AND 50S MONDAY. ALSO A FACTOR WITH THE WARMUP IS A
SOUTHWEST WIND AHEAD OF DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE MOVING INTO THE
PLAINS AS COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE MID MS VALLEY LATE MONDAY. BOTH
NAM/WRF AND GFS BRING CLOUDS IN AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM MONDAY NIGHT.
SW FLOW ALOFT ALSO CONTINUES AND SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM
REACHING FREEZING EXCEPT POSSIBLY AROUND TRI CITIES. GUIDANCE GIVES
LOW CHANCE POPS TO MOST SITES LATE MONDAY NIGHT DECIDED TO BRING
JUST SLIGHT CHANCE INTO THE PLATEAU COUNTIES AND KEEP THE REST OF
THE FORECAST AREA DRY. RECENT SYSTEMS HAVE SLOWED DOWN SEVERAL
HOURS SO NOT WANTING TO SPEED THINGS UP YET. MODELS DIVERGE TUESDAY
WITH NAM MOVING SYSTEM THROUGH TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT DRYING
THINGS OUT WEDNESDAY. GFS IS SLOWER WITH SYSTEM AND CUTS OFF AN UPPER
LOW IN THE SOUTHWEST THAT GETS CAUGHT IN THE SW FLOW BRINGING
MOISTURE BACK NORTH OVER THE FRONT WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. WILL
KEEP FORECAST AS IS WITH THE RAIN MOVING OUT BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
NEW UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPS ACROSS ROCKIES THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.
GULF OPENS UP AND SPREADS RAIN INTO THE REGION FOR DAY 7. RAISED
TEMPERATURES BASED ON NEW MOS GUIDANCE DAYS DAYS 4 THOUGH 7.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
452 AM EST SUN FEB 18 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY)...MOST INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IS 
LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES ON BACK SIDE OF THE EXITING LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM. HAD THOUGHT BRIEFLY ABOUT ENDING ADVISORIES AND 
WARNINGS OVER WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY (INSTEAD OF 
7AM EST ENDING TIME)...BASED ON MODEL DATA AND LATEST RADAR OR 
SATELLITE PICS. HOWEVER...AFTER A FEW CALLS MADE TO THOSE COUNTIES 
(ESPECIALLY NRN PLATEAU AND SEQUATCHIE VALLEY COUNTIES)...SEEMS THAT 
THE SNOW MAY BE JUST A LITTLE MORE WIDESPREAD AND AT LEAST LIGHT 
INTENSITY THAN AREA RADAR LOOPS WOULD INDICATE. ANOTHER FACTOR THAT 
FAVORS CONTINUING THE PREVIOUS ENDING TIMES LATER THIS MORNING...IS 
THE VERY HAZARDOUS ROAD CONDITIONS NOTED GENERALLY ACROSS MOST IF 
NOT ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING.

OTHERWISE...WILL CONTINUE TO SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT THE GFS MOS MAX TEMPS 
FOR TODAY...GIVEN TRACK RECORD OVER PAST FEW DAYS AND DECENT AMOUNT 
OF SNOW COVER IN MANY AREAS. KEPT POP GRIDS CLOSE TO PREVIOUS 
FORECAST AND WELL ABOVE 18/00Z MOS...BASED ON RADAR AND CALLS MADE.
WAS A BIT CONCERNED ABOUT STRENGTH OF W-NW SURFACE WINDS TODAY...
BUT KMRX AND KHTX VAD WIND PROFILES (VWPS) SHOW LOW LEVEL JET 
DECREASING TO 25 KNOTS. WIND GRIDS FOR TODAY WERE FRESHENED WITH THE 
NAM12 MODEL DATA...WHICH MIGHT BE A TAD HIGH ON SPEEDS...BUT DID 
MESH WELL WITH NEIGHBORING WIND SPEEDS TO OUR EAST FROM GSP AND 
RNK.  

.LONG TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...AFTER PRECIPITATION ENDS
GFS IS QUICK TO CLEAR CLOUD COVER WITH NAM/WRF HOLDING ONTO THE LOW
LEVEL CLOUDINESS MOST OF THE NIGHT IN THE NE AS FLOW FROM THE NW
CONTINUES TO BRING IN FEED OF MOISTURE. THINKING THAT CLOUDS MAY BE
STUBBORN AND CONTINUE NORTHERN HALF. ANOTHER FACTOR IN LOW
TEMPERATURE FORECAST IS STRONG NW TO W WINDS THAT SHOULOD DROP OFF
DURING THE EVENING AS PRESSURE GRADIENT RELAXES. GUIDANCE VALUES FOR
TONIGHT ARE MOSTLY IN THE 20S. WENT BELOW GUIDANCE SEVERAL DEGREES
NE WITH SNOW COVER ON THE GROUND AND ANTICIPATED CLEARING BEFORE
MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE MOVING EAST ALONG THE GULF COAST AND COLD
UPPER TROUGH EXITING TO THE NE WILL HELP THE REGION WARM UP INTO
THE 40S AND 50S MONDAY. ALSO A FACTOR WITH THE WARMUP IS A
SOUTHWEST WIND AHEAD OF DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE MOVING INTO THE
PLAINS AS COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE MID MS VALLEY LATE MONDAY. BOTH
NAM/WRF AND GFS BRING CLOUDS IN AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM MONDAY NIGHT.
SW FLOW ALOFT ALSO CONTINUES AND SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM
REACHING FREEZING EXCEPT POSSIBLY AROUND TRI CITIES. GUIDANCE GIVES
LOW CHANCE POPS TO MOST SITES LATE MONDAY NIGHT DECIDED TO BRING
JUST SLIGHT CHANCE INTO THE PLATEAU COUNTIES AND KEEP THE REST OF

1030 AM EST SAT FEB 17 2007

.DISCUSSION...LATEST MODEL RUNS SUPPORT CURRENT FORECAST. FIRST ROUND
OF SNOW HAD BETTER THAN EXPECTED COVERAGE BUT AMOUNTS HAVE BEEN 
LIGHT. PREFRONTAL WAA THIS AFTERNOON WILL HAVE IMPLICATIONS ON SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS MAINLY ACROSS S PLATEAU. MAY HAVE TO EXTEND SNOW 
ADVSRY DOWN PLATEAU. WILL DECIDE SHORTLY. TN MNTS MAY BE UPPED TO 
HEAVY SNOW WARNING WITH AFTERNOON PACKAGE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:  
SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...17/00Z GFS HAS SLOWED DOWN THE 
ARRIVAL OF PRECIPITATION WITH THE APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
FROM 24 HOURS AGO...BUT IS STILL A FEW HOURS FASTER THAN LATEST 
NAM-WRF MODEL. CLOUDS ARE JUST BEGINNING TO ARRIVE OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH ANY WINTRY PRECIPITATION STILL WELL TO OUR WEST AND JUST 
INTO FAR WESTERN PARTS OF KY AND TN. WILL COMPROMISE SOME AND JUST 
SLIGHTLY DELAY THE START OF SNOW (AND SOME RAIN SRN AREAS) FROM 
PREVIOUS GRIDS...WHICH WAS CONSENSUS FROM NEIGHBORING OFFICES AS 
WELL.

PREVIOUS SNOW AMOUNT GRIDS AND SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT STILL SEEM 
IN THE BALL PARK OVERALL...SO ONLY SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS MADE TO SNOW 
AMOUNTS...MAINLY IN THE FIRST 6 HOUR GRID FROM 12-18Z TODAY WHERE 
AMOUNTS WERE LOWERED DUE TO LATER START. DECIDED TO RUN WITH 3 SNOW 
ADVISORY AREAS...STAGGERED SLIGHTLY IN STARTING AND ENDING TIMES 
FROM WEST TO EAST. SNOW ADVISORIES FOR THE NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES...
SWRN VA...NE TN AND THE NRN/SMOKY MTNS. CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES 
WONT GET MORE THAN A DUSTING LATE TODAY...AND POSSIBLY AN INCH OR 
SO TONIGHT...WITH SIMILAR THINKING FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF POLK 
COUNTY TN INTO CHEROKEE/CLAY COUNTIES OF NC. LATER SHIFTS CAN 
RE-THINK THIS...AS WELL AS POTENTIAL FOR NRN AND SMOKY MTNS AREAS TO 
POSSIBLY GET JUST ABOVE OUR 4 INCH CRITERIA (WHICH WOULD JUSTIFY A 
WARNING). OTHERWISE...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES HIGHEST OVER SE TN 
AREAS...BUT MODELS DEPICT MUCH LIGHTER QPF THAT FAR SOUTH...PLUS I 
SEE LIKELIHOOD THAT A RAIN AND SNOW MIX SHOULD OCCUR FOR THOSE AREAS 
UNTIL AFTER SUNSET TODAY. 

SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES SHOULD LINGER AT LEAST INTO SUNDAY MORNING 
FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS...WHICH WAS REASONING TO CARRY SNOW ADVISORY 
FOR NRN/SMOKY MTNS THROUGH LATE MORNING THERE. OTHERWISE...UNDERCUT
GFS MOS HIGHS AGAIN TODAY...GIVEN TRACK RECORD OVER PAST TWO DAYS.
MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY WERE QUITE CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED.

WSWMRX WILL QUICKLY FOLLOW ZFPMRX...AND PERHAPS A VERY BRIEF SPECIAL 
WEATHER STATEMENT FOR COUNTIES NOT IN AN ADVISORY.  

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SNOW MOVES OUT AS SKIES 
CLEAR FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL GRADUALLY 
DECREASE OVERNIGHT BUT STRONGER NW WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS OF SW VA 
AND NE TN WILL CAUSE WIND CHILL TEMPERATURES TO BE NEAR ZERO. SUNDAY 
NIGHT SHOULD BE THE LAST COLD NIGHT FOR AWHILE. EXPECTING SINGLE 
DIGITS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTH WITH TEENS TO LOWER 20S ELSEWHERE. 
WHERE THERE IS STILL SNOW COVER LOWS MAY BE EVEN COLDER. COLD UPPER 
TROUGH SHIFTS EAST MONDAY WITH FLOW BECOMING ZONAL. HIGH PRESSURE 
AND DRIER AIRMASS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RISE TO MORE NORMAL 
HIGHS IN THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S. ANOTHER SYSTEM DEVELOPING ACROSS 
THE PLAINS WILL SPREAD CLOUDS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY. WARMER TEMPERATURES AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL CAUSE 
RAIN TO FALL TUESDAY AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM. THIS PRECIPITATION MAINLY 
FROM ISENTROPIC LIFT. AHEAD OF THE FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT THE 
PRECIPITATION SHOULD BECOME MORE SHOWERY WITH POSSIBLY SOME THUNDER. 
THEN LINGERING MOISTURE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. NEWEST GFS 
MODEL RUN FASTER WITH ENDING PRECIPITATION ON WEDNESDAY. FOR 
CONTINUITY WILL KEEP CHANCE OF SHOWERS INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT. DRIER 
AND MILD CONDITIONS RETURN THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS RIDGING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHWEST MOVES INTO THE SOUTHEAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...STRENGTHENING JET 
FROM THE N ROCKIES DIGS SE AND SETS UP W-E ACROSS DEEP SOUTH OF SAT. 
SFC LOW TRACKS SE THROUGH UPR MS VLY TONIGHT THEN WEAKENS MOVING E 
ACROSS OH VLY SAT. CLOUDS THICKEN IN NW FLOW FROM ABOVE OVRNIGHT BUT 
TEMPS WONT NEED MUCH TIME TO PLUMMET AFT SUNSET. MOST AREAS WILL BE 
A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN THIS MORNING. 1000-850MB SW FLOW INCREASES 
IN RESPONSE TO SFC LOW ON SAT. MOS GUIDANCE DEPICTS A RAPID WARMUP 
EARLY IN DAY. FEEL THIS IS OVERDONE EXPECTING GOOD CLOUD 
COVER...VIRGA AND EVAPORATIVE COOLING WITH LOW WET BULBS IN PLACE. 
LIGHT TO MODERATE SNOW WILL ADVANCE ACROSS THE AREA FROM THE NW 
EARLY SAT AFTERNOON WITH MOST GROUND TEMPS AT OF BELOW FREEZING TO 
ALLOW FOR LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS. SEE SPSMRX. MID LEVEL TROUGH AXIS AND 
SFC FRONT MOVE EAST THROUGH AREA SAT EVENING. HEAVIEST SNOWFALL 
SHOULD OCCUR BETWEEN 17/22Z AND 18/09Z. UPSLOPE SNOWS WILL DOMINATE 
SUNDAY MORNING. STAYED ON THE COOL SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR SUN MAXS 
BUT THIS MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC PER THICKNESS HEIGHTS AND NW FLOW. 
CONTINUED BELOW NORMAL TEMPS SUNDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...RIDGE BUILDS INTO 
THE AREA ON MONDAY...BRINGING DRY WEATHER ON MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT.  NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACHES ON TUESDAY.  MOISTURE 
INCREASING AHEAD OF IT...WILL RAISE POPS TO 30 PERCENT FOR TUESDAY.  
WITH ABUNDANT MOISTURE AND LIFT AVAILABLE...WILL CONTINUE WITH 
CHANCE POPS ON TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  BEST CHANCES 
SHOULD BE ON WEDNESDAY AS SURFACE AND UPPER LOWS TRACK THOUGH THE 
AREA.  THICKNESSES INDICATE PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE ALL LIQUID ON 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...INCLUDING THE OVERNIGHT PERIODS.  GFS 
KEEPING THE UPPER LOW JUST TO THE EAST OF OUR CWA...WILL FOLLOW HPC 
LEAD WHICH CLEARS THE SYSTEM OUT QUICKER THAN GFS...SO ONLY KEPT 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE MORNING HOURS ON THURSDAY.  RIDGE BUILDS 
IN ON THURSDAY NIGHT...BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND 
FRIDAY. SHOULD HAVE A NICE WARMING TREND THIS WEEK.  STAYED NEAR 
HPC/MEX FOR TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...SUNNY COLD DAY. TEMP ADVECTION NEUTRAL. DRY AIRMASS
AND SUNSHINE SHOULD LET TEMPS BRIEFLY SPIKE UPWARD THIS AFTERNOON. 
CURRENT MAX TEMPS MAY BE TOO OPTIMISTIC BY A DEGREE OR TWO BUT WILL 
LET STAND. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE VORT MAX MOVING INTO WRN TN 
AND NRN MS THIS MORNING IS PROGD TO MOVE QUICKLY ACROSS LATER THIS 
MORNING...BUT PASS MAINLY TO OUR SOUTH.  NOT MUCH MORE THAN 0.10 
INCH OF PRECIPITABLE WATER NOTED ON AREAL MODEL SOUNDINGS...SO I 
DONT EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN SOME PASSING MID AND HIGH CLOUDS EARLY 
TODAY (PROBABLY NO WORSE THAN PARTLY CLOUDY OVERALL).  TIME HEIGHT 
SECTIONS SHOW CONSIDERABLE SUNSHINE FOR THIS AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH 
STILL A COLD AIRMASS IN PLACE AND NOTED THAT GFS MOS WAS 2 TO 4 
DEGREES TOO WARM FOR HIGHS YESTERDAY.  THUS...I STAYED CLOSER TO THE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER MOS BLEND FOR HIGHS TODAY.

GFS MODEL BRINGS PRECIPITATION IN FASTER ON SATURDAY THAN NAM-WRF...
BUT LOOKS SAFE TO KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR TONIGHT.  WILL INCREASE 
CLOUDS FROM THE NORTHWEST AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...AHEAD OF THE FAST 
MOVING SHORTWAVE DROPPING INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY DAYBREAK
SATURDAY.  THE INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND DEVELOPMENT OF SW SURFACE 
WINDS LATE TONIGHT SEEMED TO FAVOR THE NOT AS COLD MIN TEMPS WHERE 
DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED IN MOS CHOICES. 

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS NOW BRINGING IN 
NEXT SYSTEM THAT DROPS DOWN FROM THE NORTHWEST A FEW HOURS EARLIER 
WITH THE GFS ABOUT 6 TO 12 HOURS EARLIER THAN NAM/WRF. THICKNESSES 
AND 850 MB TEMPERATURES STILL POINTING TO A MOSTLY SNOW EVENT FOR 
THE FORECAST AREA. SOUTHERN VALLEY LOCATIONS MAY WARM INTO THE 40S 
SO SOME RAIN MAY FALL THERE BEFORE CHANGING TO SNOW BY EVENING 
SATURDAY NIGHT. AMOUNTS LOOK LIKE GENERALLY LESS THAN 2 INCHES AT 
THE LOWER ELEVATIONS WITH AMOUNTS OF POSSIBLY 4 TO 5 INCHES AT THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN SW VA AND EASTERN TN MOUNTAINS. SYNOPTIC SNOW 
WILL TRANSITION TO SOME UPSLOPE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUE 
THROUGH SUNDAY IN THE EASTERN AND NORTHERN AREAS. CLOUDS INCREASING 
SATURDAY AND EARLIER START TO SNOW MAY KEEP HIGHS A FEW DEGREES 
LOWER THAN CURRENT FORECAST. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL OCCUR 
BEHIND SYSTEM SUNDAY SO LOWERED HIGHS A FEW DEGREES TO MATCH CLOSER 
TO NAM GUIDANCE. MOST PLACES WILL STAY IN THE 30S WITH SOME SNOW 
COVER WITH HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE 20S. UPPER TROUGH BEHIND 
WEEKENDS SYSTEM MOVES NORTHEAST MONDAY WITH HIGH PRESSURE BRIEFLY 
BUILDING IN FROM THE WEST AND SOUTHWEST. THE FLOW BECOMES MORE 
ZONAL. A WEAK FRONT APPROACHES TUESDAY AND TEMPERATURES CONTINUE TO 
WARM. AFTER THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. 
RIDGING ACROSS THE SOUTHWEST CONTINUES THE WARMER AND DRIER WEATHER 
FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...A COLD VALENTINES DAY. POST FRONTAL DRY AND VERY COLD 
AIRMASS MOVING INTO AREA. LIGHT SNOWS WILL MAINLY AFFECT UPSLOPE AREAS
THIS AFTERNOON AS BRISK NW WINDS CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING. 
WIDESPREAD TEMPS IN THE 20S. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING 
ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING.  ASSOCIATED BAND OF SHOWERS WILL 
CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST AHEAD OF THE FRONT EARLY THIS 
MORNING...EXITING THE AREA LATE MORNING.  WITH THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE...WINDS WILL INCREASE OVER THE AREA...PROVING BREEZY 
CONDITIONS THROUGH THE MRX CWA TODAY.  BEHIND THE FRONT...MUCH 
COLDER AIR WILL PUSH IN.  WITH STRONG COLD ADVECTION...SHOULD SEE 
TEMPS FALL SOMEWHAT DOING THE MORNING HOURS WITH SOME INCREASE THIS 
AFTERNOON.  AS A RESULT...EARLY MORNING PRECIP...AHEAD OF THE FRONT 
WILL BE RAIN...WITH ANY LINGER SHOWERS BEHIND THE FRONT SLOWLY 
TURNING TO SNOW.  RESIDUAL MOISTURE AND UPSLOPE FLOW WILL KEEP SOME 
SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OVER EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND PORTIONS OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGHOUT THE AFTERNOON.  A FEW FLURRIES MAY 
CONTINUE FAR NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT.  WITH COLD AIR CONTINUING TO 
FILTER IN...OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL FALL INTO THE TEENS AND LOW 20S 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA.

LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUE)...UPPER TROUGH THAT SWINGS ACROSS THE 
REGION THU NIGHT WILL NOT HAVE MUCH MOISTURE TO WORK WITH...SO JUST 
EXPECT SOME MAINLY HIGH AND MID CLOUDS THU AND THU NIGHT.  HIGH 
PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE WILL PROVIDE A QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE 
FRI...BUT IT WILL STILL BE ON THE COLD SIDE.  NEXT SYSTEM IS A 
CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEM FOR SATURDAY/SATURDAY NIGHT.  QUITE A BIT OF 
UNCERTAINTY IN EXACT TRACK AND TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS FOR SAT AND SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE FOR SAT NIGHT.  ANY 
PRECIP MAY BE SNOW IN NORTH AND HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT BOUNDARY LEVEL 
TEMPS MAY BE WARM ENOUGH FOR SOME RAIN SAT AFTERNOON IN SOUTHERN AND 
CENTRAL VALLEY LOCATIONS.  AFTER SOME LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS 
SUN...SHOULD BE DRY MON INTO TUE.

222 AM EST WED FEB 14 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING ACROSS 
THE REGION THIS MORNING.  ASSOCIATED BAND OF SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO 
PUSH EAST AHEAD OF THE FRONT EARLY THIS MORNING...EXITING THE 
AREA LATE MORNING.  WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...WINDS WILL INCREASE 
OVER THE AREA...PROVING BREEZY CONDITIONS THROUGH THE MRX CWA TODAY.  
BEHIND THE FRONT...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL PUSH IN.  WITH STRONG COLD 
ADVECTION...SHOULD SEE TEMPS FALL SOMEWHAT DOING THE MORNING HOURS 
WITH SOME INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON.  AS A RESULT...EARLY MORNING 
PRECIP...AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL BE RAIN...WITH ANY LINGER SHOWERS 
BEHIND THE FRONT SLOWLY TURNING TO SNOW.  RESIDUAL MOISTURE AND 
UPSLOPE FLOW WILL KEEP SOME SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OVER 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGHOUT THE 
AFTERNOON.  A FEW FLURRIES MAY CONTINUE FAR NORTHEAST OVERNIGHT.  
WITH COLD AIR CONTINUING TO FILTER IN...OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL FALL 
INTO THE TEENS AND LOW 20S ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA.

.LONG TERM...(THU THROUGH TUE)...UPPER TROUGH THAT SWINGS ACROSS THE 
REGION THU NIGHT WILL NOT HAVE MUCH MOISTURE TO WORK WITH...SO JUST 
EXPECT SOME MAINLY HIGH AND MID CLOUDS THU AND THU NIGHT.  HIGH 
PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE WILL PROVIDE A QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE 
FRI...BUT IT WILL STILL BE ON THE COLD SIDE.  NEXT SYSTEM IS A 
CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEM FOR SATURDAY/SATURDAY NIGHT.  QUITE A BIT OF 
UNCERTAINTY IN EXACT TRACK AND TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS FOR SAT AND SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE FOR SAT NIGHT.  ANY 
PRECIP MAY BE SNOW IN NORTH AND HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT BOUNDARY LEVEL 
TEMPS MAY BE WARM ENOUGH FOR SOME RAIN SAT AFTERNOON IN SOUTHERN AND 
CENTRAL VALLEY LOCATIONS.  AFTER SOME LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS 
SUN...SHOULD BE DRY MON INTO TUE.

TO MSL LINE WITH SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS ALONG AND AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT.  A FEW LIGHTNING STRIKES NOTED ACROSS MIDDLE TN...BUT THE 
STRONGER CONVECTION AND MORE LIGHTNING STRIKES WERE FURTHER SOUTH 
OVER CENTRAL AND SRN AL.  SOME SLIGHT INSTABILITY ACROSS CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...SO WILL WATCH FOR POSSIBLE AMENDMENT TO CHA TAF FOR A 
BRIEF THUNDERSTORM LATER THIS EVENING.

OTHERWISE...POPS MAY BE INITIALLY TOO HIGH BETWEEN THIS APPROACHING 
CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION AND THE LARGER SHIELD OF RAIN ABOUT TO EXIT 
THE EXTREME NORTHEAST PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA.  WILL MOST LIKELY 
ADJUST POP AND WEATHER GRIDS BY AROUND 9PM EST TO BETTER REFLECT

320 PM EST TUE FEB 13 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...COMPLICATED FORECAST THIS 
EVENING AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ACROSS WESTERN TN AND KY WITH COLD 
FRONT EXTENDING TO THE SOUTH SOUTHWEST THROUGH MS MOVES SLOWLY NE. 
ALSO A NEW LOW PRESSURE AREA WAS DEVELOPING ACROSS SOUTHERN GEORGIA. 
A NEARLY SOLID AREA OF CONVECTION WAS ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND EXTENDED 
INTO AL THIS MORNING BROKE UP AS IT MOVED INTO EAST TN THIS 
AFTERNOON. THIN CLOUD COVER NE OF TYS ALLOWED THE WARMER AIR ALOFT 
TO MIX DOWN FROM THE WARM SW FLOW OVER THE AREA. TEMPERATURES SHOT 
UP INTO THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S IN THE NE HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. PATCHY LIGHT RAIN HAS FALLEN ACROSS NE SECTIONS AND JUST AREAS 
OF LIGHT RAIN ELSEWHERE. EXPECT THE LULL IN PRECIPITATION TO 
CONTINUE LATE THIS AFTERNOON AS CONVECTION ACROSS THE FL PANHANDLE 
AND SOUTHERN GA ROBS THE AREA OF THE BETTER GULF MOISTURE. NEW 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT IN NORTH MS AND SW TN 
SHOULD INCREASE IN COVERAGE AS THEY SPREAD INTO MIDDLE TN AND THEN 
EAST TN THIS EVENING. KEPT THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS GOING ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN FORECAST AREA INTO THE EVENING AS THE CONVECTION COULD 
MOVE INTO SE TN BEFORE WEAKENING THIS EVENING AND THE AREA WILL 
STILL BE AHEAD OF THE FRONT. AFTER THE FRONT PASSES THROUGH LATE 
THIS EVENING TO AROUND 14/06Z TEMPERATURES WILL DROP DRAMATICALLY 
AND THE RAIN SHOWERS SHOULD CHANGE OVER TO SNOW BY MORNING. STILL DO 
NOT EXPECT MUCH ACCUMULATION DUE TO THE WARM TEMPERATURES 
TODAY...MELTING AT FIRST AND THE DEEPER MOISTURE MOVING OUT IN THE 
MORNING. HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY SEE AROUND AN INCH OR POSSIBLY TWO AT 
THE HIGHEST PEAKS. HIGHS WEDNESDAY WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB MORE THAN 
A FEW DEGREES AND MAY STAY STEADY OR FALL SLIGHTLY WITH STRONG COLD 
AIR ADVECTION. RIGHT NOW WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS LOOK TO BE BELOW 
WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA.              

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...A LARGE DOME OF 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH FRIDAY...BRINGING 
A RETURN TO DRY AND UNSEASONABLY COLD CONDITIONS. A FAST-MOVING 
CLIPPER SYSTEM ON SATURDAY WILL BRING A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA...BUT ONLY LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED. 
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL DEVELOP BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT FOR SATURDAY 
NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...CREATING ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SNOW 
SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
ANOTHER FAST-MOVING CLIPPER SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY...BRINGING LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS AGAIN.

.DISCUSSION...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CURRENTLY CROSSING THE MS RIVER 
INTO TN SHOULD CONTINUE TO MOVE NE INTO EASTERN KENTUCKY BY EVENING. 
A LINE OF PRE FRONTAL SHOWERS WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WAS MOVING 
SLOWLY EAST ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND EASTERN AL AND WILL BE MOVING 
ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND INTO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY LATE 
THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON. NEW NAM/WRF SOUNDINGS INDICATE SOME 
INSTABILITY IN THESE AREAS THIS AFTERNOON. WITH UPDATE WILL ADD 
CHANCE OF THUNDER THROUGH THE AFTERNOON FOR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
SECTIONS. TEMPERATURES ARE WARMING INTO THE 50S ON THE PLATEAU AND 
40S ELSEWHERE EXCEPT A FEW PLACES WHERE COLD AIR IS TRAPPED IN SW VA 
STILL IN THE 30S. WILL LOWER POPS SLIGHTLY FOR EASTERN AND CENTRAL 
SECTIONS BASED ON SLOWER MOVEMENT OF PRECIPITATION INTO THOSE AREAS. 
NOT SURE IF TEMPERATURES WILL WARM TO 60 IN THE SOUTHWEST WITH RAIN 
MOVING IN SHORTLY. WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS DEVELOPING THOUGH AND 
POSSIBLE BREAKS IN PRECIPITATION THIS AFTERNOON WILL KEEP THE HIGHS 
UNCHANGED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CENTER OF LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
CURRENTLY MOVING INTO ARKANSAS SHOULD TRACK UP INTO EASTERN KENTUCKY 
BY THIS EVENING...KEEPING US IN THE WARM AIR FOR TODAY INTO EARLY 
TONIGHT.  RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA TODAY...WILL GO WITH 
CATEGORICAL POPS ALL ZONES. LOOKS LIKE INSTABILITY WILL BE MARGINAL 
FOR THUNDER...WILL GO AHEAD AND LEAVE OUT SINCE PREVIOUS SHIFT 
REMOVED MENTION THAT WAS IN SOUTHERN ZONES.  AS THE ACTION SHIFTS TO 
THE EAST TONIGHT...MUCH COLDER AIR WILL PUSH IN LATE TONIGHT.  
APPEARS BULK OF DEEPER MOISTURE WILL PULL OUT AHEAD OF THE COLDER 
AIR...SO WHILE THERE MAY BE SOME SNOW SHOWERS LATE ESPECIALLY NORTH 
AND HIGHER TERRAIN...APPEARS TO NOT BE MUCH OF A THREAT OF 
SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION FOR OUR AREA EVEN IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
TONIGHT.     

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS 
WILL LINGER OVER THE MRX CWA INTO WEDNESDAY AS THE WEATHER SYSTEM 
EXITS THE AREA.  WRAP AROUND MOISTURE AND UPSLOPE FLOW WILL KEEP A 
FEW POCKETS OF LIGHT SNOW/FLURRIES MAINLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN INTO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  ZONAL FLOW ALOFT THURSDAY BRINGS THROUGH A VERY 
WEAK WAVE AND EXPECT MAINLY ASSOCIATED CLOUDS WILL ACCOMPANY IT.  
NEXT SYSTEM SHOULD PUSH INTO THE AREA FOR THE WEEKEND PROVIDING A 
MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW ACROSS THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...SYSTEM SLOWLY MAKING 
ITS WAY TOWARD AREA WITH OVERCAST CONDITIONS OVER MOST OF THE AREA 
ALREADY. PROFILES ALREADY WILL ABOVE FREEZING IN ALL AREAS...SO NOT 
CONCERNED ABOUT ANY SNOW OR FREEZING RAIN THROUGH THIS PERIOD. DUE 
TO DRY AIR...COULD BE A BRIEF PERIOD OF SLEET FOR ANY AREAS THAT GET 
SOME PRECIP THIS EVENING...BUT EXPECT IT TO BE BRIEF ENOUGH TO NOT 
INCLUDE IN FORECAST.

LIFT ALREADY GETTING SOME LIGHT RAIN GOING IN NORTHEASTERN 
SECTIONS...THIS AREA SHOULD BE SLOWLY LIFTING TO THE NORTH OUT OF 
AREA THIS EVENING. AFTER THIS BOUT...COULD BE A WHILE UNTIL NEXT 
ORGANIZED PRECIP AFFECTS THE AREA...AROUND DAYBREAK IN WESTERN 
AREAS. TUESDAY LOOKS WET FOR MOST OF AREA AND SHOULD TRANSITION FROM 
LIGHT RAIN TO MORE SHOWER ACTIVITY IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AS 
WELL AS ALONG THE FRONT. AIR MASS MIGHT GO MARGINALLY UNSTABLE 
BRIEFLY DURING THIS TIME...BUT TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE...LATE 
TUESDAY NIGHT...NOT GOOD FOR GETTING THERMODYNAMICS AND DYNAMICS 
ALIGNED...SO JUST STICKING WITH SHOWERS.

DEEP MOISTURE SWEEPING QUICKLY OUT OF AREA AS COLDER AIR BEHIND 
FRONT ENTERS LATE TUESDAY NIGHT...SO CHANCES FOR SNOW NOW MINIMAL... 
AND MAINLY UPSLOPE AFTER THE END OF THIS PERIOD. HAVE NOT STRAYED 
TOO FAR FROM GUIDANCE TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS 
PROGGED TO BE LOCATED ACROSS THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...WITH SOME WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. ANY RESULTING PRECIP SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT WITH SOME UPSLOPE 
FLOW CONTRIBUTING TO A FEW LINGERING RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK...BRINGING A RETURN TO A COLD AND 
DRY ARCTIC AIR MASS. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN CONTINUES TO INDICATE THAT 
A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY... 
BRINGING SOME LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS. THUS...WILL PLAN TO KEEP LOW 
CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR SATURDAY. A FAST-MOVING CLIPPER 
SYSTEM IS CURRENTLY PROGGED TO APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL KEEP THE FORECAST DRY AT THIS TIME SINCE THE 
EXTENDED MODELS HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT LATELY.

NEXT SYSTEM HEADED THIS WAY AND CLOUDS FILLING IN QUICKLY. INVERTED 
V OV CLEARING RACING ACROSS AREA MAY BE ONLY CHANCE FOR SUN NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS. TIMING OF CLEARING AREA LOOKS ONLY MAYBE 30 MINUTES 
OF PARTIAL CLEARING ACROSS THE NORTH...WHEREAS ALONG THE GA BORDER 
EXTREME SE TN AND SW NC COULD GET AROUND AN HOUR OR SO OF SUN BEFORE 
CLOUDS TO WEST FILL BACK IN. ALSO...BETTER CHANCES OF ADDITIONAL 
EROSION OF CLOUD COVER IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS WHERE WEAK SPOTS CAN BE 
SEEN ON VIS SATELLITE BACK IN NORTHERN AL. THEREFORE...HAVE KEPT 
HIGH TEMPS FAIRLY WARM FOR TODAY SOUTH...BUT COOLED DOWN HIGHS UP 
NORTH.
 
ALTHOUGH CLOUDS ARE AHEAD OF SCHEDULE...THINK RAIN CHANCES STILL 
MINIMAL THIS AFTERNOON. IR SATL SHOWS TOP OF CLOUD COVER WARMING 
EVERYWHERE EAST OF MS RIVER...SO MOISTURE WONT BE DEEP ENOUGH TO

POSSIBILITY OF SOME PRECIPITATION BY THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT.  
MODEL TREND WITH THIS SYSTEM HAS BEEN FURTHER NORTH...WITH A SLOWING 
TREND FOR THE ONSET OF PRECIP.  APPEARS BETTER LIFT WILL STAY NORTH 
AND WEST OF OUR AREA THROUGH TONIGHT. HOWEVER...EXACTLY WHERE THE 
BAND OF ISENTROPIC LIFT PRECIP WILL SET UP TODAY INTO TONIGHT IS 
STILL PROBLEMATIC. GIVEN UNCERTAINTY...WILL KEEP LOW POPS IN NORTH 
AND CENTRAL FOR TODAY...AND WHILE WILL DROP POPS CONSIDERABLY MOST 
AREAS FOR TONIGHT...WILL STILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH TO HIGH 
CHANCE NORTHWEST ZONES.  SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL RAIN IN THE 
SHORT TERM.  WILL ONLY MAKE MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS.           

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...GFS MODEL A LITTLE FASTER WITH 
MAJOR LEAGUE STORM SYSTEM EARLY IN THE PERIOD BUT THIS HAS LITTLE 
IMPACT ON MY FORECAST AS CATEGORICAL POPS BROAD BRUSHED ACROSS THE 
AREA FOR TUESDAY AS SURFACE LOW MOVES NORTHEAST FROM THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE WITH MOST EXCELLENT ABOVE 
NORMAL WARMTH EVEN ON TUESDAY. LOW LEVELS WARM SUFFICIENTLY TO 
CREATE ENOUGH INSTABILITY FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF THUNDERSTORMS 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY. LOW BUILDS 
NORTHEAST THROUGH THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS BY LATE EVENING DRAGGING 
MOST OF THE DEEPER RH EAST. HOWEVER AS ARCTIC AIR FLOWS INTO THE 
REGION TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY HAD TO USE CHANCE AND SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW WITH HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE TERRAIN 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AS 
USUAL. DRIER AND MUCH COLDER NORTHWESTERLY FLOW IN STORE THURSDAY. 
AIRMASS MODIFIES SLIGHTLY BY FRIDAY BUT CHANCE FOR PRECIP BACK IN 
THE FORECAST FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY AS ANOTHER UPPER TROF DROPS 
SOUTHEAST OUT OF CENTRAL CANADA IN CLIPPER FASHION. USED THE 
STANDARD MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW WITH HIGHEST CHANCE POP SATURDAY 
NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA TODAY WILL GIVE WAY TONIGHT. SKIES 
WILL BE CLEAR THROUGH THE EVENING WITH SOME HIGH AND MID LEVEL 
CLOUDS MOVING IN LATE AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM APPROACHES. SLIGHTLY 
HIGHER DEWPOINTS AND PERHAPS A LITTLE MORE MIXING WILL KEEP LOWS 
HIGHER THAN LAST NIGHT...IN THE 20S IN MOST SPOTS. TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD WARM NICELY ON MONDAY AS THE HIGH MOVES EAST AND A SOUTH TO 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW DEVELOPS. SHOULD SEE A GOOD AMOUNT OF SUN AS WELL 
AS THICK LOW CLOUDS DONT MOVE INTO OUR WESTERN COUNTIES UNTIL MID 
AFTERNOON. THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SW NC COULD REACH THE UPPER 50S. 
ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BRING LOW CLOUDS INTO THE WEST IN THE MID 
AFTERNOON. THE STRONGER LIFT STAYS MAINLY TO OUR NORTH ON 
MONDAY...BUT BOTH THE NAM AND THE GFS SHOW SOME PRECIP IN THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA BEFORE 00Z. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS IN 
THOSE AREAS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... 
WARM UP CONTINUES MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY AS LONG COLD PERIOD ENDS 
TEMPORARILY AS DEVELOPING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND DEEPENING LOW 
PRESSURE AREA SLOWLY MOVE EAST OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO 
THE LOWER MS VALLEY. A MUCH MILDER NIGHT MONDAY NIGHT AS THICK CLOUD 
COVER MOVES IN AND SOUTHERLY WINDS INCREASE OUT AHEAD OF SURFACE LOW 
MOVING INTO THE TN VALLEY. BOTH MODELS BRING SURFACE LOW ACROSS 
FORECAST AREA LATE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AND ALSO DEVELOP A 
SECOND LOW EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WHICH MOVES OFF THE EAST COAST 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. HEAVIEST RAINFALL MOVES INTO OHIO 
VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT WITH FORECAST AREA ON SOUTHERN EDGE OF INITIAL 
PRECIPITATION AREA. AS LOW MOVES EAST TUESDAY RAINFALL SHOULD PICK 
UP AND MAY BECOME MORE SHOWERY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
NAM/WRF SHOWING SOME INSTABILITY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND GOOD SHEAR  
SO THUNDERSTORMS ARE A POSSIBLILITY IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA 
BUT WILL NOT PUT IN THE FORECAST JUST YET. TOTAL RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
THOUGH DO NOT LOOK THAT HIGH. TUESDAY NIGHT COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH 
WITH VERY COLD AIRMASS MOVING IN FROM THE NORTHWEST AND ENOUGH 
LEFTOVER MOISTURE FOR SOME SNOW. BEST CHANCE OF ACCUMULATING SNOW 
WILL BE IN THE NORTH AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WITH WARM TEMPERATURES 
MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY EVENING THINK SNOW WILL HAVE DIFFICULTY 
ACCUMULATING ON SURFACES. ONLY FORECAST LOWS TO REACH BELOW 32 ON 
THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...SW VIRGINIA AND THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF 
EAST TENNESSEE AS FREEZING LEVEL DROPS TUESDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE PULLS 
OUT QUICKLY WEDNESDAY. HIGHS WEDNESDAY WILL ONLY BE A FEW DEGREES 
WARMER THAN LOWS WITH STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION. 

THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED COLD UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT BRUSHING THE NORTHERN AREAS WITH 
SOME CLOUDS AND POSSIBLY FLURRIES AND ARCTIC HIGH MOVES INTO THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN STATES KEEPING THINGS COLD. ANOTHER CLIPPER 
SYSTEM MOVES SOUTHEAST FROM CANADA AT THE END OF THE WEEK AND 
SPREADS CLOUDS AND A CHANCE OF SNOW OR RAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

LOWER AS MODELS SHOWING SLIGHTLY SLOWER SOLUTIONS IN TERMS OF 
INITIATION OF PRECIP MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT. THE GOOD NEWS IS THAT 
PRECIP SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF RAIN AS DECENT WARMING OCCURS AS 
TROF APPROACHES. STILL APPEARS THERE COULD BE SOME HEALTHY RAINFALL 
ACROSS THE REGION WITH HIGHEST QPF ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
BEGINNING LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUING INTO TUESDAY. COLD FRONT 
PRESSES EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY NIGHT AND SOME LIFT AND 
A FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE PRESENT ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE STORM

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE
MID MS VALLEY TODAY WILL BUILD SOUTHEAST...AND BE CENTERED OVER THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. WITH CLEAR SKIES AND
CALM WINDS...ALONG WITH NEGATIVE DEW POINTS...TEMPS SHOULD DROP
BELOW LAST NIGHTS LOWS...INTO THE TEENS AND SINGLE DIGITS. AN AREA
OF CHANNELED VORTICITY SCRAPES OUR SW VA COUNTIES TOMORROW
MORNING...BRINGING SOME CLOUDS TO THAT AREA. HOWEVER MOST OF THE
CWA SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY SUNNY THROUGH THE DAY. 1000-850 THICKNESS
VALUES ARE QUITE A BIT HIGHER TOMORROW THAN TODAY...SO HIGH TEMPS
SHOULD REACH INTO THE 40S TO LOWER 50S SOUTH. DEW POINTS MAY ALSO
RECOVER SLIGHTLY FROM TODAYS VALUES...BUT STILL REMAIN IN THE
SINGLE DIGITS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...STORM SYSTEM ALONG
THE WEST COAST TODAY WILL BE THE MAIN WEATHER MAKER EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY MOVE EAST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
SUNDAY NIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY. LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE MOVING TROUGH
ALONG WEST COAST MORE SLOWLY EAST THAN EARLIER RUNS AND LOW
PRESSURE THAT IS FORECAST TO DEVELOP IN THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AHEAD
OF THE SYSTEM JUST BEGINS TO DEEPEN SUNDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE FROM THE
GULF MOVES INTO THE MS VALLEY MONDAY AND THEN SLOWLY SPREADS EAST
DURING THE DAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. DECREASED CLOUD COVER SUNDAY NIGHT 
AND MONDAY AND DROPPED LOWS INTO THE 20S. HELD OFF PRECIPITATION
START UNTIL AFTERNOON AND WITH INCREASING HEIGHTS AND THICKNESSES
MONDAY IT LOOKS LIKE ALL RAIN FOR THE FORECAST AREA. SIGNIFICANT
RAINFALL STILL LIKELY TUESDAY WITH SURFACE LOW TRACKING ACROSS THE
AREA. HEAVIEST RAINFALL MAY PASS JUST TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST
AREA INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. ANOTHER MASS OF COLD AIR WILL MOVE IN
BEHIND THIS SYSTEM TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THE RAIN SHOULD
CHANGE TO SNOW FROM WEST TO EAST TUESDAY NIGHT AS FREEZING LEVELS
DROP. A COUPLE INCHES COULD FALL IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND
NORTHERN SECTIONS BEFORE IT ENDS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. DRY NORTHWEST
FLOW WILL CONTINUE THE REST OF THE PERIOD WITH VARIABLE CLOUDS AND
COLDER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES. GFS MODEL TRYING TO SHOW MOISTURE
MOVING INTO THE RIDGE THURSDAY BUT THINK AIRMASS WILL BE TO DRY FOR
PRECIPITATION. WENT ON THE COOLER SIDE FOR TEMPERATURES SUNDAY
NIGHT WITH LESS CLOUD COVER AND DRY AIR STILL IN PLACE AND WITH
CLOUDS INCREASING QUICKLY MONDAY GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE NAM/WRF. &&

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOOKS DRY IN THE SHORT TERM WITH 
DRY LOW LEVEL AIR AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATING. ANOTHER 
BATCH OF MID CLOUDS APPROACHING FROM THE WEST IS ERODING ON THE 
FRONT END...BUT ENOUGH MAY MAKE IT INTO OUR AREA TO WARRANT A PARTLY 
SUNNY FORECAST FOR TODAY.  TONIGHT SHOULD START MOSTLY CLEAR...BUT 
MAY SEE A FEW MORE CLOUDS AGAIN TOWARD MORNING.  WILL UNDERCUT MAV 
TEMPS A BIT FOR TODAY...BUT WILL NOT ARGUE WITH MAV FOR TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRY WEATHER MAINTAINED SUNDAY 
WITH GRADUALLY DEPARTING SURFACE RIDGE WHILE SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT 
WAVE PRESSES STEADILY EAST ACROSS SOUTHWESTERN U.S. UPPER TROF 
INITIATES DEVELOPMENT OF SURFACE LOW ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
DEEPENING AS IT MOVES EAST ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. WARM AND MOIST 
AIRMASS FROM THE GULF IS TAPPED AND OVERRUNS THE STILL RATHER COLD 
ARCTIC AIR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING WHICH REQUIRES MENTION 
OF SNOW UNTIL WARM AIR ADVECTION WINS OUT ALLOWING PRECIP TO FALL AS 
RAIN. DECENT LIFT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION APPARENT FROM GFS/WRF MODEL 
DEPICTION FOR MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING WHEN MAINTAINED 
HIGHEST POPS. COLD AIR ADVECTION FILLS IN BEHIND DEPARTING SYSTEM 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY BRINGS THE POSSIBILITY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...WEAK VORT MAX HAD MOVED INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH SOME ENHANCEMENT JUST NOTED ON 
INFRARED SATELLITE PICS. HOWEVER...LOW LEVELS REMAIN VERY DRY WITH 
CURRENT DEWPOINT TEMPS GENERALLY IN THE MINUS 5 TO PLUS 5 FARENHEIT 
RANGE. THUS...WEAK RETURNS ON AREA RADARS ARE MAINLY A LOWERING MID 
DECK OF CLOUDINESS WITH LITTLE IF ANY PRECIPITATION (PCPN) REACHING 
THE SURFACE. STILL A LITTLE BETTER MOISTURE TO OUR SOUTH...SO KEPT 
IN A MENTION OF SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES EARLY ACROSS SRN TIER OF 
ZONES. JUST GOT A REPORT OF LIGHT SNOW/FLURRIES IN THE JONESVILLE VA 
AREA...WHICH IS COVERED IN CURRENT GRIDS THROUGH 23Z...AS WELL AS 
LATEST SHORT TERM FORECAST.

OTHERWISE...LIKED THE PREVIOUS DECREASING CLOUDS IN THE GRIDS 
TONIGHT...AND ALSO KEPT MIN TEMPS UP A BIT CLOSER TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
MOS MINS WHERE DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED. MOS HIGHS TODAY WILL END UP 
BEING GREATER THAN 5 DEGREES TOO WARM. MORE SUNSHINE LOOKS IN THE 
OFFING FOR SATURDAY...BUT 925 TO 850 MB TEMPS DONT WARM VERY 
SIGNIFICANTLY...SO I UNDERCUT THE GENERALLY MILDER GFS MOS MAX TEMPS
FOR HIGHS TOMORROW.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS 
TO MOVE EAST SUNDAY. SOME THIN HIGH CLOUDS MAY SPREAD IN SATURDAY 
NIGHT BUT TEMPERATURES SHOULD STILL FALL INTO THE TEENS TO MID 20S. 
CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE SUNDAY AS EASTERN TROF FLATTENS OUT 
AND WESTERN RIDGE BUCKLES. MOISTURE QUICKLY SPREADS FROM THE PLAINS 
TO THE MS VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT AND INTO THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE 
VALLEYS MONDAY. LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS JUST EAST OF THE ROCKIES 
SUNDAY AND THEN MOVES INTO MS VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE FROM THE 
GULF MOVES NORTH INTO THE MS AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS SUNDAY NIGHT. 
AIRMASS STILL DRY AT THE LOWER LEVELS SUNDAY BUT SHOULD MOISTEN 
RAPIDLY SUNDAY NIGHT. PREFER SLOWER MAV WITH POPS BUT FOLLOWED 
WARMER WRF/NAM MINIMUMS. WITH THICK CLOUD COVER MOVING IN SUNDAY 
NIGHT LOWS MAY COME BEFORE MIDNIGHT. WARM AIR ALOFT WILL KEEP MOST 
OF THE INITIAL PRECIPITATION AS RAIN EARLY MONDAY BUT COLD AIR MAY 
BE TRAPPED IN THE VALLEYS OF NORTHEAST TN AND SW VA AND CAUSE A 
LITTLE SNOW BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN. FREEZING LEVELS FALL LATE 
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AND THIS COULD BRING A FEW INCHES OF SNOW TO 
THE MOUNTAINS OF SW VA AND THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS. THE AMOUNTS WILL 
DEPEND ON HOW MUCH MOISTURE IS LEFT AT THE END. RAINFALL AMOUNTS MAY 
BE A COUPLE INCHES AS WELL IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY. A WEAK SYSTEM FOLLOWS THE STRONGER SYSTEM MOVING OUT EARLY 
WEDNESDAY. PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS WERE SLOWER BRINGING SYSTEM IN 
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW IN 
THE FORECAST FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...APPEARS BETTER MOISTURE WITH 
DISTURBANCE MOVING THROUGH REGION TODAY WILL STAY TO OUR SOUTH. A 
BIT OF LIGHT PRECIP MAY SNEAK INTO SOUTHERN AREAS...SO WILL 
INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THERE.  A LOOK AT SOUNDINGS INDICATES 
ANY PRECIP COULD FALL AS LIGHT SNOW/SLEET OR RAIN...WILL MENTION ALL 
THREE IN FORECAST.  WILL MENTION POSSIBILITY OF FLURRIES IN SOME 
CENTRAL ZONES...THEN JUST MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR THE NORTH TODAY.  CLOUDS 
SHOULD DIMINISH TONIGHT AS DRIER AIR MOVES IN.  WILL REMAIN ON THE 
COLD SIDE...WILL JUST MAKE A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS WHICH 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...PERSISTANT EASTERN STATES 
UPPER TROF FINALLY WEAKENS A BIT DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE LONG 
TERM FORECAST ALLOWING FOR A DRY WEEKEND AND A SUBTLE WARMING TREND. 
THE NEXT SYSTEM TO BRING A CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION EMERGES ACROSS 
THE PLAINS STATES BY 12Z MONDAY INDUCING LOWER SURFACE PRESSURE 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. USED HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR INCREASING 
ISENTROPIC LIFT AS TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE ADVECTION STRENGTHEN 
AHEAD OF APPROACHING SURFACE LOW. MAINTAINED LIKELY POPS FOR TUESDAY 
AND TUESDAY NIGHT AS LOW MAKES ITS WAY EAST ON A TRACK NEAR THE 
SOUTHERN TENNESSEE BORDER. THIS SCENARIO INVOLVES SOME FROZEN 
PRECIPITATION ESPECIALLY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. DIDNT TRY TO 
GET TOO FANCY WITH PRECIP TYPES AT THIS TIME RANGE SO JUST USED THE 
RAIN/SNOW CONCEPT. SYSTEM EXITS BY 12Z WEDNESDAY WHICH KEPT DRY. 
CONTINUED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR THURSDAY AS ACTIVE SOUTHERN 
STREAM KEEPS THREAT FOR PRECIP ALIVE TOWARD THE END OF THE WEEK IN 
CHILLY AIRMASS PROGGED TO RESIDE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH.

ISENTROPIC LIFT GENERATES SOME PRECIP JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA ON 
THURSDAY MORNING. WILL NOT HAVE ANY PRECIP MENTIONED WITH THIS

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
925 AM EST WED FEB 7 2007

.DISCUSSION...
SURACE COLD FRONT HAS PASSED THROUGH THE AREA THIS MORNING.
RESULTING COLD ADVECTION IS CAUSING TEMPERATURES TO DROP...AND OUR
HIGHS TODAY HAVE MOST LIKELY HAVE ALREADY BEEN REACHED. A NORTHWEST
FLOW OFF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL LIKELY CAUSE A DOWNSLOPING
EFFECT THAT WILL KEEP THE VALLEY WITH AT LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES
THROUGH THE DAY. THE BALANCE BETWEEN SOLAR HEATING AND COLD
ADVECTION WILL BE TRICKY...BUT EXPECT THAT TEMPS WILL EITHER BE
NEARLY STEADY OR DROP A BIT FROM CURRENT OBS. UPDATE WILL ADJUST
TEMPERATURE TRENDS AND REMOVE LOW POPS IN THE NORTHEAST.

.UPDATE...LOCAL RADARS HAVE NOT SHOWN MUCH REDEVELOPMENT OF PRECIP 
UPSTREAM OF THE FORECAST AREA AND LOCAL OBS REVEAL THAT WINDS HAVE 
RAPIDLY DECREASED BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. THUS...HAVE CANCELLED THE 
ADVISORIES AND UPDATED THE ZONE FORECASTS TO REMOVE THE WINTER 
WEATHER AND WIND ADVISORY HEADLINES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORTWAVE TRACKING THROUGH THE 
AREA WITH STILL SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE LINGERING...MAINLY THIS 
MORNING. NOT MUCH SHOWING UP ON RADAR...BUT WILL KEEP SOME LOW POPS 
IN FOR THE MORNING HOURS. BEST POPS IN THE NORTH WHERE BEST MOISTURE 
RESIDES. SOUNDINGS STILL INDICATE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW OR LIGHT 
FREEZING RAIN IN THE NORTH...WILL KEEP WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY GOING 
UNTIL 8 AM. STILL A FEW PLACES WITH STRONG WINDS IN THE CENTRAL AND 
NORTH...BUT THEY SHOULD CONTINUE TO DECREASE THIS MORNING. WILL KEEP 
WIND ADVISORY GOING...BUT LET IT EXPIRE AT 6 AM. DRY WEATHER RETURNS 
TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA INTO THE WEEKEND...BRINGING DRY CONDITIONS. 
BULK OF THE ARCTIC AIR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS HIGH SHOULD STAY 
NORTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH TEMPS REMAINING ONLY SLIGHTLY 
BELOW NORMAL (A LITTLE WARMER THAN PREVIOUS DAYS). LATEST GFS MODEL 
RUN INDICATES A DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER TEXAS ON 
SUNDAY...WHICH MAY BRING SOME LIGHT PRECIP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
THIS LOW SHOULD STAY SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE MOST PART... 
WITH ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING ACROSS TEXAS ON MONDAY. 
THIS NEXT SYSTEM SHOULD BRING A BETTER CHANCE FOR PRECIP...WITH THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
340 PM EST TUE FEB 6 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...MID LEVEL VORT CONTINUES TO 
MOVE RAPIDLY SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. SNOW STARTED 
MAKING IT THROUGH THE DRY LOW LEVEL AIRMASS EARLIER IN THE AFTERNOON 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORY COVERS A POSSIBLE ONE TO THREE INCH ACCUMULATION ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. 
PROBLEMS RESULT AS AN 85H JET AROUND 50-60 KTS (WIND ADVISORY 
PRODUCTS CREATED FOR TONIGHT) PRODUCES THERMONUCLEAR WARMING. THIS 
WARMING IS WELL UNDERWAY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATE THIS AFTERNOON. 
SO IT BECOMES A RACE TO SEE IF THE WARMING WILL OBLITERATE THE 
CHANCE FOR FROZEN/FREEZING PRECIP ENTIRELY OR PERHAPS WILL SLOW THE 
SNOWFALL EVENT DOWN AND MIX WITH FREEZING RAIN TO CREATE THE 
FORECAST THAT I ISSUED. HOPEFULLY THE LATTER OCCURS AND THE ADVISORY 
CORRECTLY ADVISES FOR SLIPPERY ROADS IN THE AFFECTED AREAS. PRECIP 
WRAPS UP AS SNOW ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
WEDNESDAY MORNING AS LIFT RAPIDLY MOVES AWAY AND DRIER NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW BEGINS. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS IN THE SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FRONT SAGGING SOUTH 
OF CWA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  MID TO UPR LEVEL MOISTURE MOVES ACROSS 
THE AREA ON THU. WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT NORTH OF OLD BOUNDARY MAY 
BRING LIGHT RAIN ACROSS S PART OF MRX CWA THU EVE/NGT. LEANED 
FORECAST SLIGHTLY AWAY FROM THE GFS ALLOWING MORE INFLUENCE OF LARGE 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE AND CLEARER SKIES THROUGH WEEKEND. UNDERCUT GFS 
TEMPS OVER THE WEEKEND AS WELL. INVERTED TROUGH WORKS ITS WAY 
NORTHWARD INTO THE AREA BY MON AFTN. THIS WILL INCREASE TEMPS AND 
MOISTURE INTO MONDAY NGT. GOOD CHANCE OF RAIN TUE AS LOW DEVELOPS 
OVR DEEP SOUTH.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO 
RIVER VALLEYS...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY COLD AND DRY AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. CURRENT RADARS REVEAL SOME LIGHT ECHOES MOVING ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING...BUT FEEL THIS IS MOSTLY VIRGA 
BECAUSE OF THE DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE (AND NO REPORTS OF SNOW FROM 
SURFACE OBS). A FAST-MOVING CLIPPER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED 
TO MOVE FROM THE NORTHERN ROCKIES TODAY INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
BY TONIGHT...BRINGING SOME LIGHT WINTRY PRECIP ACROSS MAINLY THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. WRF AND GFS MODELS ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT SHOW SOME 
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES IN THEIR VERTICAL TEMP PROFILES (WHICH WILL 
AFFECT THE TYPE OF WINTRY PRECIP EXPECTED FOR THE AREA). OVERALL... 
IT APPEARS THAT MOSTLY SNOW WILL DEVELOP ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA...BUT 
SOME FREEZING RAIN WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE THIS EVENING AS A STRONG 
SOUTHWEST 850 MB JET (IN EXCESS OF 50 KTS) ADVECTS WARMER AIR ALOFT. 
THE LEADING EDGE OF THIS ABOVE-FREEZING AIR ALOFT SHOULD SET-UP OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA THIS EVENING...SO WILL MENTION SOME FREEZING RAIN BUT 
THINK THAT MOSTLY SNOW WILL OCCUR. BOTH MODELS SHOW THE BULK OF THIS 
PRECIP MOVING NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO WV...BUT THINK THAT 1 
TO 3 INCHES OF SNOW WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE OVER SOUTHWEST VA. MODELS 
ALSO REVEAL SOME CONDITIONAL SYMMETRIC INSTABILITY (RESULTING IN 
POSSIBLE SNOW BANDING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS OF 
EXTREME NORTHEAST TN)...SO WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WINTER WX ADVISORY 
FOR THESE AREAS BEGINNING LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT. WITH 
THIS SYSTEM QUICKLY EXITING THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY...THINK 
THAT SNOW AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIMITED TO ADVISORY LEVEL (1-3).

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...FRONT SAGGING SOUTH OF 
CWA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SOME MOISTURE LINGERING...BUT WILL KEEP 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT DRY FOR NOW. A CLIPPER SYSTEM PUSHING THROUGH ON 
THURSDAY...WILL ADD 20 POPS FOR SNOWSHOWERS FOR THURSDAY MORNING FOR 
OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES. REST OF AREA SHOULD REMAIN DRY BUT CLOUDY. 
GFS INDICATING AN INVERTED TROUGH PUSHING INTO AREA ON THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND FRIDAY. BEST MOISTURE REMAINS SOUTH...SO WILL KEEP 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY DRY FOR NOW. SHORTWAVE TRACKS INTO AREA ON 
SATURDAY. BEST MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH...BUT WILL KEEP 20 POPS FOR 
SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT FOR OUR NORTHERN ZONES AND THE 
MOUNTAINS. DRY WEATHER RETURNS ON SUNDAY ALONG WITH WARMER 
TEMPERATURES. WARMING TREND CONTINUES INTO MONDAY ALONG WITH THE 
NEXT DISTURBANCE. SHOULD BEGIN AS LIQUID PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY 
BEFORE CHANGING TO A WINTER MIX ACROSS OUR NORTHERN AREAS ON MONDAY 
NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...DESPITE INCREASE IN MID 
LEVEL MOISTURE TONIGHT IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT FORECAST REMAINS DRY. 
HOWEVER POPS INCREASE LATER TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AS NEVER 
ENDING SHORTWAVES DROP SOUTHEAST OUT OF CANADA. NEXT SYSTEM WITH 
ASSOCIATED LOW AND MID LEVEL MOISTURE UNFORTUNATELY HAS A COLD 
ATMOSPHERE TO WORK WITH AND THEREFORE SNOW LIKELY TO OCCUR IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS WELL AS THE MOUNTAINS 
BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA WHERE SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATION MAY OCCUR. 
MIXED PRECIP RESULTS ACROSS MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST 
AREA AS LOW LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION DEVELOPS AHEAD OF OFFENDING 
SYSTEM. PRECIP SHOULD BE FAIRLY LIGHT AS ATMOSPHERE WARMS AND MIXES 
WITH OR CHANGES TO RAIN FOR MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY. 
THIS EVENT STILL 30 HOURS INTO THE FUTURE AND FORECAST FOR THIS 
NORTHWEST FLOW/CLIPPER SYSTEM A LITTLE UNCERTAIN. AT ANY RATE PRECIP 
ENDS FOR MOST OF THE AREA BY NOON WEDNESDAY. TWEAKED MAX TEMPS BACK 
A BIT BELOW GUIDANCE FOR WEDNESDAY BUT STAYED CLOSE DURING REMAINDER 
OF SHORT TERM. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...12Z RUN OF THE GFS 
CAME IN MUCH COOLER THEN THE 00Z RUN. THIS APPEARS TO BE A GOOD 
TREND CONSIDERING SNOW COVER AND CURRENT UPSTREAM T/TD PLOTS. GFS 
POSSIBLY GETTING A BETTER HANDLE ON LOW LEVEL AIRMASS. HAVE ADJUSTED 
EXTENDED FORECAST TO BE MORE IN LINE WITH DGEX AND HPC SOLUTIONS. 
LIGHT PCPN MAY CONTINUE BRIEFLY WEDNESDAY NIGHT BUT WILL LEAVE OUT 
OF FORECAST FOR NOW. FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD BE JUST S OF MRX CWA ON 
THU. WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT SETS UP ALONG GA BORDER THU AND THU NGT. 
WILL CARRY LOW CHC POPS FOR THAT PERIOD IN THE SOUTH. REINFORCING 
COLD SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH ON SAT. LIGHT SNOWS EXPECTED LATE SAT INTO

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH AND CAROLINA COAST...WITH A LARGE 
DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE (WHICH STRETCHES BACK TO CANADA) BUILDING INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA. A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY WAS CREATING SOME CLOUDS AND LIGHT SNOW FLURRIES ACROSS KY 
AND WV THIS MORNING. AS A RESULT...WILL PLAN TO KEEP A MENTION OF 
SNOW FLURRIES ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA THIS MORNING. THIS COLD AIR MASS 
TODAY WILL BE THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON...WITH TEMPS STRUGGLING 
TO RISE INTO THE 20S AND 30S ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WILL PLAN TO 
KEEP THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY GOING UNTIL 11 AM THIS MORNING...AS 
WIND CHILL VALUES WILL LIKELY REMAIN BELOW -5 DEGREES ACROSS THE

QUESTION AS WARMER AIR ARRIVES IN THE MID-LEVELS. REMAINDER OF LONG
TERM ALSO LOW CONFIDENCE AS GFS HAS DISPLAYED POOR RUN-TO-RUN
CONSISTENCY AND ENSEMBLE SPREAD IS TOO GREAT TO BE OF MUCH HELP.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...ANOTHER FAST DISTURBANCE
TONIGHT WHICH IS REALLY MOISTURE STARVED SO TRIMMED POPS BACK TO
FLURRIES AND ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS FOR PARTS OF SW VA...NRN MTNS
AND SMOKIES EARLY MONDAY. NAM-WRF WINDS HAVE BEEN TOO STRONG PAST
COUPLE OF DAYS...SO LOWERED THOSE SPEEDS AND MIXED SOME GFS VALUES
IN AS WELL. HOWEVER...SEEMS THAT I KEPT SPEEDS UP ENOUGH WITH
FALLING TEMPS TO JUSTIFY A WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR THE SMOKIES AND
NRN MTNS OF TN. RAN THIS ADVISORY FROM 11 PM TO 11 AM MONDAY...
WHICH GENERALLY WAS THE PERIOD OF COLDEST WIND CHILLS. VALUES WILL
BE MARGINAL ANYWHERE WINDS DECOUPLE...SO WILL RUN A RANGE OF 5
ABOVE TO 15 BELOW ZERO IN THE ZONES AND WSWMRX.

OTHERWISE...RELATIVE HUMIDITIES STAY ABOVE RED FLAG WARNING
CRITERIA WITH WIND SPEEDS MARGINAL ANYWAY AFTER TOMORROW.

MATCHING MOS GUIDANCE FOR MINS TONIGHT PUT ME OUT OF TOLERANCE WITH
NEIGHBORS SLIGHTLY...SO UNDERCUT GFS MOS BY A DEGREE OR TWO TO
MESH BETTER. FAVORED A BLEND FOR HIGHS MONDAY...CLOSE TO GUIDANCE
MONDAY NIGHT...THEN A BLEND ON TUESDAY DUE TO MODEL DIFFERENCES
BETWEEN NAM-WRF AND GFS. GFS FASTER WITH PCPN AND WARMER...BUT FOR
NOW KEPT FORECAST AS A COMPROMISE ON PCPN CHANCES AND HIGH TEMPS
ALSO. SHOULD WARM ENOUGH FOR NOT ALL SNOW BY AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...YET ANOTHER ARCTIC FRONT 
RIPS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT WITH WEAK SHORTWAVE AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE WAVE CREATING ENOUGH LIFT FOR THE MENTION OF SOME 
-SHSN ALONG WITH A BIT OF -SHRA ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY EARLY IN 
THE EVENING. EVENT PRETTY MUCH OVER BY 12Z WEDNESDAY WITH SURFACE 
RIDGING. STAYED WITH THE ISENTROPIC LIFT/OVERRUNNING MOIST 
ATMOSPHERE OVER COLD LOW LEVEL AIRMASS IDEA FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY 
AS SURFACE WAVE RIDES NEAR THE GULF COAST CREATING A SMALL CHANCE

.DISCUSSION...CALLED AROUND TO OUR NE PLATEAU COUNTIES AND WISE CO VA
WHERE GENERALLY REPORTS WERE OF A DUSTING TO AROUND 1/4 INCH OF A 
VERY DRY SNOWFALL. SOME ROADS WERE LIGHTLY COVERED. ECHOES ON RADAR 
ARE ZIPPING EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...SO THIS PERIOD OF SNOW 
SHOULD BE SHORT-LIVED. THUS...WILL PROBABLY KEEP POPS AS IS IN THE 
CHANCE CATEGORY BUT MAY ADD SCATTERED WORDING. SNOW IS SO DRY THAT 
MIGHT NOT EVEN MELT DOWN TO MORE THAN 0.01 INCH.

OTHER ITEM OF CONCERN IS WINDS ALOFT WITH KHTX AND KMRX VAD WIND 
PROFILES (VWP) SHOWING AROUND 30 TO 40 KNOTS TO MIX DOWN TODAY.
MONITORING WINDS FROM AVAILABLE OBSERVATION SITES SO FAR SUPPORTS 
OUR CURRENT 15 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 35 MPH...WHICH WILL BE BELOW

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM BECKLEY WV TO MEMPHIS TN...WITH TEMPS IN 
THE 20S ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE 
SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH AN UPPER- 
LEVEL SHORT WAVE TRIGGERING SOME LIGHT SNOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF 
OF THE AREA. CURRENT RADARS ALREADY REVEAL SOME LIGHT SNOW ACROSS 
CENTRAL KY WITH THIS SHORT WAVE...AND THINK THAT THIS PRECIP WILL 
MAINLY AFFECT SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN THIS MORNING. WITH COLD 
TEMPS...EXPECT A HIGH LIQUID TO SNOW RATIO WITH THIS EVENT. 
HOWEVER...ANY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA SHOULD REMAIN 
LESS THAN AN INCH...SINCE A DRY AIR MASS REMAINS IN PLACE AND THIS 
SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THE REGION. BREEZY WINDS SHOULD 
DEVELOP AGAIN TODAY WITH STRONG 850 MB WINDS MIXING DOWN TO THE 
SURFACE IN THE AFTERNOON. TEMPS WILL STILL HAVE A HARD TIME RISING 
THIS AFTERNOON...AND THINK THAT HIGHS WILL BE A LITTLE COOLER THAN 
YESTERDAY WITH MORE CLOUDS EXPECTED. GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT 
ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF 
OF THE FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT...BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR 
SOME LIGHT SNOW. 


.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD AND RELATIVELY DRY
WEATHER EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. A
SERIES OF WEAK NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVES WILL CONTINUE TO
TRANSLATE THROUGH THE EASTERN CONUS LONGWAVE TROUGH. THESE WAVES
WILL BE ACCOMPANIED BY VERY LITTLE MOISTURE. BELIEVE GFS GUIDANCE
POPS ARE OVERDONE AND HAVE GENERALLY KEPT MENTION OF POPS OUT OF
THE FORECAST. THE EXCEPTION IS TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY
INTO SATURDAY AS AT LEAST SOME ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SUPPORT MENTIONING
POPS. MODELS/ENSEMBLES CONTINUE TO ADVERTISE A MAJOR
DEAMPLIFICATION OF UPPER AIR FLOW OVER NORTH AMERICA BY LATE WORK
WEEK...RESULTING IN SIGNIFICANT HEIGHT RISES OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. SHOULD SEE AT LEAST SOME MODERATION IN TEMPS LATE IN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...TWO MINOR DISTURBANCES IN
THE UPPER FLOW...EACH FOLLOWED BY ANOTHER SURGE OF COLD AIR...WILL
AFFECT THE REGION. FIRST ONE TONIGHT HAS A LITTLE BETTER MOISTURE
...ALTHO STILL SOMEWHAT SHALLOW. TIME HEIGHTS AND SOUNDINGS ONLY
SHOWED MOISTURE HIGH ENOUGH TONIGHT ACROSS SWRN VA TO TAP INTO SOME
ICE NUCLEATION POTENTIAL. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE ONLY AROUND
0.15 INCH IN THIS VERY DRY ARCTIC AIR...AND 12Z MODEL RUN HAS EVEN
LESS QPF THAN PREVIOUS 00Z OR 06Z DATA. THUS...I WAS SKEPTICAL
ABOUT PLAYING THIS EVENT UP MUCH AT ALL. DID INCREASE POPS IN OUR
TYPICAL HORSESHOE PATTERN WHERE WE CAN GET A DUSTING WITH THIS TYPE
OF FEATURE...AND PERHAPS MORE SO TO BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORING
OFFICES GRIDS.

SIMILAR FEATURE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY LOOKS REALLY STARVED FOR
MOISTURE...SO ONLY 20 PERCENT POPS OVER PARTS OF NORTHEAST AREAS.
WENT CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR MINS...BUT UNDERCUT TOWARD THE COLDER
BLEND ON HIGH TEMPS.  

WILL NEED TO WATCH WIND CHILL VALUES AFTER TONIGHT...MAINLY IN
HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS...FOR POSSIBLY DROPPING INTO WIND CHILL
ADVISORY RANGE. WILL ALSO MONITOR WIND SPEEDS PLUS DRY AIR FOR
POSSIBLE FIRE DANGERS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROF 
HOLDS IT POSITION KEEPING FRIGID TEMPERATURES IN PLACE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. FLOW IS RELATIVELY DRY WITH ONLY 
LIMITED WEAK SHORTWAVE LIFT UNTIL LATE IN THE WEEK. THEREFORE COLD 
DRY WEATHER EXPECTED UNTIL FRIDAY/SATURDAY TIMEFRAME WHEN SHORTWAVE 
TROF RIDES EAST ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH WITH POSSIBLE ISENTROPIC LIFT 
CREATING THE SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF SNOW AND RAIN.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH ANOTHER ONE OVER THE UPPER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS NEXT COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA BY SUNSET THIS AFTERNOON...WITH BREEZY WINDS 
DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT FOR TODAY. EVEN WITH FULL SUNSHINE TODAY... 
TEMPS WILL STILL HAVE A HARD TIME RISING THIS AFTERNOON...WITH HIGHS 
STILL BELOW NORMAL. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE WILL TRIGGER SOME LIGHT SNOW AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY MORNING. WILL ONLY HAVE LOW POPS SINCE THE AIR MASS SHOULD BE 
FAIRLY DRY BEHIND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE THIS EVENING. BREEZY WINDS AND 
UNSEASONABLY COLD TEMPS ARE AGAIN EXPECTED ON SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
CONTINUE TO PROJECT SIGNIFICANT DEAMPLIFICATION OF UPPER FLOW BY THE 
END OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD. UPPER FLOW BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL BY LATE 
IN THE PERIOD. SIGNIFICANT HEIGHT RISES OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ARE PROJECTED TO ACCOMPANY THE FLOW DEAMPLIFICATION. IN 
THE MEANWHILE...COLD...DRY POLAR AIR WILL PERSIST IN NORTHWEST FLOW 
OVER THE REGION WITH OCCASIONAL WEAK SHORT WAVES AFFECTING THE AREA. 
TIMING THESE INDIVIDUAL EVENTS REMAINS PROBLEMATIC. NOT EXPECTING 
ANYTHING VERY SIGNIFICANT WITH THESE WAVES ANYWAY AS MOISTURE WILL 
REMAIN A LIMITING FACTOR. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE TRENDS FOR 
POPS BUT KEPT POPS IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY. ALSO STUCK
CLOSELY TO GFS GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LATE IN THE

OVERNIGHT. 

HOWEVER...TEMPS LOOK TO DROP WELL BELOW FREEZING TONIGHT...SO I
WILL ISSUE AN SPS TO ALERT THE PUBLIC FOR POSSIBLE BLACK ICE ON
AREA ROADS AS A FAIR AMOUNT OF LIGHT RAIN OR MELTING SNOW FELL
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA TODAY.

OTHERWISE...WENT WITH GFS MOS OVERALL EACH PERIOD. KEPT SOME
CONTINUITY FOR LOW CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES SAT NIGHT AND
SUNDAY ACROSS MAINLY NE AREAS AND SMOKIES.  


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE ARCTIC EXPRESS WILL 
BE IN OPERATION ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT 
WEEK KEEPING TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL. ALSO A WEAK CLIPPER 
PASSAGE IS INDICATED FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING. DUE TO 
ANEMIC APPEARANCE OF SYSTEM STAYED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE 
EVENT. ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE AND DRIER NORTHWEST FLOW KEEP PRECIP OUT 
OF THE FORECAST UNTIL FRIDAY AS UPPER FLOW FLATTENS AND MOISTURE 
GRADUALLY RETURNS AROUND DEPARTING SURFACE RIDGE. ATMOSPHERE STILL 
COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME FROZEN PRECIP IN THIS SCENARIO BUT CONFIDENCE 
RATHER LOW ON DAY 7

.DISCUSSION...VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION INTENSITY NOTED OVER WRN TWO 
THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF 
NRN PLATEAU GENERALLY SCATTERED OR LESS. THUS...POPS LOOK GOOD FOR 
REST OF TODAY. HOWEVER...MAY KEEP TYPE AS RAIN OR SNOW GIVEN THE 
COOLING TEMPS ALOFT. HAVE HAD A COUPLE OF SNOWFALL REPORTS THIS 
MORNING OF NEAR AN INCH IN CLAIBORNE COUNTY AND 1/4 TO 1/2 INCH IN 
LEE COUNTY VA. THIS IS COVERED WELL BY ZFP AND FORECAST GRIDS...
WITH LITTLE ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS LIKELY GIVEN SURFACE TEMPS 
IN THE LOW TO MID 30S.

OHX 12Z SOUNDING...12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS AND RUC MODEL 925-850 MB 
TEMPS WOULD SUPPORT LOWERING MAX TEMPS ACROSS THE BOARD BY A FEW 
DEGREES. SATELLITE PICS ALSO ONLY SHOW JUST PARTIAL CLEARING ALONG 
THE MS RIVER...SO SHOULD BE CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS TODAY.

OTHERWISE...CONCERNS FOR TONIGHT WILL BE HOW MUCH CLEARING OCCURS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE...WITH A COLD FRONT 
OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME MIXED PRECIP 
ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ASSOCIATED WITH AN 
UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. THIS SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEAST 
INTO SOUTHEAST KY THIS MORNING...WITH PRECIP AFFECTING MAINLY THE 
WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST TODAY. TEMPS REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING MOST 
EVERYWHERE IN THE FORECAST AREA (WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS ABOVE 3000 FT). THUS...THE LATEST OBS HAVE REPORTED A MIX 
OF RAIN AND SNOW THIS MORNING...AND THINK THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE 
THIS MORNING WITH LITTLE OR NO SNOW ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED. THE ONLY 
AREAS THAT MIGHT HAVE SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS UP TO AN INCH 
WOULD BE THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST VA 
ALONG THE BLACK MTN RANGE. TEMPS ARE ACTUALLY EXPECTED TO RISE INTO 
THE LOWER 40S BY EARLY THIS AFTERNOON...BEFORE A COLD FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH THE REGION. THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD BRING A DECREASE IN 
CLOUDS TONIGHT...AND COLD TEMPS IN THE TEENS AND LOWER 20S BY 
SUNRISE.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER 
LEVEL FLOW CHARACTERIZED BY SHARP RIDGE IN THE EASTERN PACIFIC AND A 
BROAD LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER MOST OF THE CONUS EAST OF THE ROCKIES IS 
EXPECTED TO PERSIST BEFORE DEAMPLIFYING BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM
PERIOD. THIS WILL ALLOW CONTINUED NORTHWEST FLOW AND WELL BELOW
CLIMO TEMPS FOR THE MOST PART. OCCASIONAL WEAK NORTHERN STREAM SHORT
WAVES WILL CONTINUE TO TRANSLATE THROUGH THIS BROAD CYCLONIC FLOW.
TIMING THESE INDIVIDUAL SHORT WAVES WILL BE PROBLEMATIC.
HOWEVER...MOISTURE WILL BE A LIMITING FACTOR AND NONE APPEAR
CAPABLE OF PRODUCING A SIGNIFICANT PRECIP EVENT.

POLAR VORTEX IS PROJECTED TO RETREAT NORTHWARD LATER NEXT WEEK 
COINCIDENTAL TO THE DEAMPLIFICATION OF THE EASTERN PACIFIC RIDGE 
ALLOWING HEIGHTS TO RISE MODESTLY OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
HOWEVER...TEMPS WILL GENERALLY REMAIN WELL BELOW CLIMO THROUGH THE 
LONG TERM. GFS GUIDANCE VALUES APPEAR TO REPRESENT A REASONABLE 
BLEND OF THE ENSEMBLE MEMBERS AND WERE GENERALLY FOLLOWED CLOSELY.

300 PM EST THU FEB 1 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...INITIAL WINTRY EVENT 
HAS ABOUT MOVED EAST OF THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...
THUS ENDING WARNINGS/ADVISORIES AT 4PM EST WORKED WELL. A PNSMRX 
WAS ISSUED WITH WHAT LIMITED SNOWFALL REPORTS WE HAD COLLECTED.

ATTENTION THEN TURNS TO APPROACHING SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX UPSTREAM FOR 
LATER TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY. SEEING SOME ENHANCEMENT ON IR SATELLITE 
PICS OVER AR/SE MO BUT LITTLE PRECIPITATION AS OF YET. A FEW 
PROBLEMS WITH THIS SYSTEM ARE...1) MODELS SEEMED TO INCREASE QPF 
QUITE A BIT FROM THE PREVIOUS RUN (AND SENSIBLY THINKING THAT THIS 
IS SOMEWHAT QUESTIONABLE)...2) TEMPS HAVE WARMED TO OR JUST ABOVE 32 
DEGREES ACROSS ALL BUT PARTS OF SWRN VA UNDER THE LOW LEVEL WARM AIR 
ADVECTION TODAY...AND 3) EXPECT TEMPS TO HOLD NEAR STEADY OVERNIGHT 
GIVEN CURRENT DEW POINT TEMPS AND CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS IN PLACE 
WITH MORE TO COME ASSOCIATED WITH SHORTWAVE FEATURE.
 
PRECIPITATION EARLY TONIGHT WOULD ALMOST HAVE TO FALL IN LIQUID FORM 
AS LIGHT RAIN...BUT WITH COLD AIR ADVECTION TOWARD MORNING I DID 
INTRODUCE PROBABILITIES OF SNOW. NE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES INTO 
LEE AND WISE COUNTIES OF SWRN VA MIGHT GET A DUSTING TO LESS THAN 1 
INCH BETWEEN 09Z AND 12Z FRIDAY. THEN THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR 
ADDITIONAL LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN OUR TYPICAL HORSESHOE PATTERN 
FROM THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS OF E TN ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
SWRN VA...BUT FOR NOW I WILL WORD AS UP TO 2 INCHES OF SNOW ACCUMS 
POSSIBLE AND NOT ISSUE A SNOW ADVISORY. PLAN TO ISSUE A BRIEF SPSMRX 
TO MENTION THIS SYSTEM IN A BIT MORE DETAIL.

THREAT OF ANY MEASURABLE PCPN CONTINUES TO DECREASE FRIDAY NIGHT...
AND LITTLE IF ANY CHANGES WERE MADE TO THOSE GRIDS. DECIDED TO 
UNDERCUT MOS FOR HIGHS FRIDAY GIVEN THE AREAS OF PCPN AND STRONG 
COLD AIR ADVECTION IN THE AFTERNOON HOURS. OPTED FOR COLDER MOS MIN 
TEMPS FRIDAY NIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LEVEL FLOW REMAINS 
NORTHWESTERLY THROUGH THE LONG TERM WHICH ALLOWS FOR MORE TAPPING OF 
ARCTIC AIR. THIS WILL KEEP TEMPS SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL 
ESPECIALLY NEXT WEEK. SHORTWAVE ENERGY SHOULD BE ABLE TO KEEP SLIGHT 
TO LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES FOR SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AND THEN AGAIN SUNDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. BONE CHILLING LOW DEWPOINT ARCTIC AIR WILL 
KEEP THE REGION DRY UNTIL THURSDAY AS TEMPERATURES MODERATE JUST A 
BIT. COULD BE A RAIN/SNOW MIX WITH THIS EVENT AS SOME WEAK WAA 
INDICATED. OF COURSE THIS LATE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST IS FANTASY 
LAND WITH CHANGES CERTAIN DURING THE COMING DAYS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...SNOW HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AND IS RAPIDLY SPREADING 
NORTH. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S AREAWIDE. HIGH 
PRESSURE HAS SHIFTED OFF THE EAST COAST AND A LOW PRESSURE AREA 
ALONG THE GULF COAST WAS SPREADING MOISTURE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST AND INTO EAST TENNESSEE AND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
MODELS SHOW STRONG LIFT THIS MORNING ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
PART OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH A JET MAX MOVING FROM THE MS VALLEY 
TO JUST EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS BY TONIGHT. AS THE SNOW STARTS 
SURFACE WINDS ARE SHIFTING TO THE SOUTHWEST. VAD WIND PROFILE SHOWS 
SOUTHWEST WINDS TO ABOUT 5 THOUSAND FEET. MODELS TRY TO BRING IN 
WARMER AIR THIS MORNING ESPECIALLY KNOXVILLE SOUTH AND THIS COULD 
CHANGE THE SNOW TO FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN. 
FARTHER NORTH THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE MAINLY SNOW. THE SURFACE LOW 
IS EXPECTED TO MOVE NORTHEAST BUT STAY FAR TO THE SOUTH. LATE TODAY 
AND TONIGHT MODELS SHOW DEEPENING MOISTURE AS A WEAK FRONT NOW 
ACROSS THE MID MS VALLEY APPROACHES. AS TEMPERATURES RISE JUST ABOVE 
FREEZING DURING THE DAY THEY WILL DROP SLOWLY DOWN TO NEAR FREEZING 
AND THE RAIN SHOULD CHANGE TO SNOW IN MOST PLACES AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
HAVE EXTENDED THE WARNING AND ADVISORY AREAS TO 4AM FRIDAY. THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA MAY SEE ABOUT THE SAME AMOUNT OF SNOW 
TONIGHT. PREFERRED THE COOLER MET NUMBERS FOR HIGHS TODAY AND 
DROPPED TEMPERATURES TO FREEZING AND SLIGHTLY BELOW TONIGHT FROM 
KNOXVILLE NORTH. SOUTHERN AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS LOOK TO 
STAY JUST ABOVE FREEZING TONIGHT. CHANGED THE WSW IN THOSE AREAS TO 
AN ADVISORY ENDING LATE TODAY BASED ON THE HIGHER QPF AMOUNTS TODAY 
AND LIGHTER AMOUNTS TONIGHT WITH SECOND SYSTEM AND WARMER 
TEMPERATURES.

ISENTROPIC LIFT WITH WARM ADVECTIVE RETURN FLOW ON BACK SIDE OF LOW

INCREASING AND RADAR SCREENS HAVE BEEN FILLING IN RAPIDLY ACROSS LA

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...12Z GFS/NAM-WRF 
MODELS GENERALLY ADVERTISE SIMILAR TIMING OF WINTRY PRECIPITATION 
(PCPN) WITH NAM-WRF SHOWING A SLIGHTLY BETTER BREAK (BUT STILL 
BRIEF) IN THE PCPN LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON OR EARLY THURSDAY EVENING.

WE WERE NOT CONVINCED THAT SUFFICIENT WARMING ALOFT WILL OCCUR ON 
THURSDAY TO CHANGE MUCH OF THE PCPN TO A MIX IN ALL AREAS. WARM 
LAYER ALOFT LOOKED TOO SHALLOW AND NOT WARM ENOUGH...SUCH THAT SNOW 
AND/OR SLEET SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE THE DOMINATE PCPN TYPE DURING THE 
DAY THURSDAY. HOWEVER...STILL ALLOWED A MIX OVER THE CENTRAL AND 
MUCH OF THE SRN VALLEY AREAS. WARNING AREAS WERE EXPANDED AND 
AMOUNTS KEPT SIMILAR...ALTHO PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL RUN 
QUITE HIGH WITH THIS EVENT...BUT ANY MIX WILL INHIBIT SNOW/ICE 
AMOUNTS. INCLUDED SEQUATCHIE VALLEY COUNTIES INTO HAMILTON AND RHEA 
DUE MAINLY TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THOSE AREAS.

DUE TO THE RAPID RE-DEVELOPMENT OF ADDITIONAL WINTRY PCPN THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...DECIDED TO RUN THE WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES THRU 
MIDNIGHT. MAY BE ABLE TO CANCEL SOME AREAS EARLIER TOMORROW...
ESPECIALLY IF A DECENT BREAK IN THE PCPN OCCURS.

OTHERWISE...WENT WITH GFS MOS ON MINS TONIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT...
SINCE THESE WERE GENERALLY THE COLDER VALUES OF CHOICE. UNDERCUT MOS 
HIGHS ON THURSDAY. HAZARD GRIDS HAVE BEEN MADE FOR SOME TIME...AND 
THE WSW MAY BE ISSUED PRIOR TO ZFPMRX OR JUST SHORTLY AFTER.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SHORTWAVE TRACKING THROUGH

MORNING HOURS.  WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR THE NORTH AND SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR THE SOUTH.  SOUNDINGS INDICATE MAY STILL SEE 
FREEZING PRECIPITATION IN THE MORNING.  MOISTURE SHOULD BE TOO 
LIMITED FOR SIGNIFICANT ADDITIONAL ICE OR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS.  
ISOLATED SNOWSHOWERS LINGER IN THE NORTHERN AREAS ON FRIDAY NIGHT 
WITH DRY WEATHER RETURNING ON SATURDAY.  A CLIPPER SYSTEM IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE NORTHERN AREAS ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY. SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR ALL SNOW.  A FRONT MOVES INTO THE

430 AM EST WED JAN 31 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TONIGHT)...AT THE SURFACE A COLD FRONT 
HAS MOVED ALMOST TO THE ATLANTIC COAST WITH HIGH PRESSURE SETTLING 
IN OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND MOVING INTO THE OHIO AND 
TENNESSEE VALLEYS. COLD AIR ADVECTION WAS STARTING TO RELAX WITH 
NORTHWEST WINDS OF 10 TO 20 MPH STILL OCCURRING ONLY IN SW VA AND 
THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TN AND SW NC. TEMPERATURES HAD DROPPED INTO 
THE TEENS TO LOWER 20S WITH SINGLE DIGIT DEW POINTS. SOME SNOW 
FLURRIES OCCURRED OVERNIGHT WITH A STRONG SHORTWAVE PASSING THROUGH 
AND IT WAS NOW ABOUT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. SKIES WERE MOSTLY 
CLEAR EXCEPT ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA EARLY THIS MORNING. SKIES SHOULD 
BECOME CLEAR BY MID MORNING AS SHORTWAVE EXITS AND SURFACE HIGH 
MOVES IN. TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL BE SLOW TO WARM WITH COLD AIR 
ADVECTION CONTINUING THIS MORNING. KEPT HIGHS IN THE MID 30S NORTH 
TO LOW 40S SOUTH. THE REAL TROUBLE STARTS TONIGHT AS A STRONG 
SOUTHWEST FLOW FROM ABOUT 850 MB ON UP BRINGS IN MOISTURE AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT TO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
AT THE SURFACE THERE WILL BE TRAPPED COLD AIR. TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
DROP BELOW FREEZING THIS EVENING AND THEN STAY STEADY OR SLOWLY RISE 
BUT STAY BELOW FREEZING WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE TEENS AND 20S. BOTH 
MODELS BRING CLOUDS IN BY EVENING AND SATURATE THE ATMOSPHERE ENOUGH 
FOR PRECIPITATION BETWEEN 6 AND 12Z WITH THE NAM/WRF A COUPLE HOURS 
SLOWER. BELIEVE THE PRECIP SHOULD START OUT AS SNOW EVEN IN THE 
SOUTH AND SHOULD REACH THE EASTERN AND NORTHERN SECTIONS BY MORNING. 
HAVE CONTINUED WINTER STORM WATCH FOR NORTHERN PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND ADDED SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE 
AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. UP TO THREE INCHES OF SNOW IS POSSIBLE 
BY THURSDAY MORNING IN SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND THE 
SMOKIES.      

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE LOW MOVES TO SOUTH 
ALABAMA BY THURSDAY EVENING. THIS FEATURE WILL PUMP MOISTURE 
NORTHWARD COUPLING WITH MID LAYER MOISTURE AND UPR SUBTROPICAL 
MOISTURE FROM THE SW. WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION A GOOD BET. 
PRECIPITATION TYPE REMAINS A BIG PROBLEM FOR THURSDAY. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS DANCE JUST A DEGREE OR TWO ON WARM SIDE OF 0C LINE UP TO 
6000 FT. MODELS INDICATING MOST SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL RISE TO 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE FREEZING. IF THESE VALUES COME IN A COUPLE OF DEGREES 
COOLER...FREEZING RAIN THREAT MAY DRAMATICALLY INCREASE. FOR NOW 
STAYED WITH GOOD SNOWFALL EARLY IN THE PERIOD. 850 MB WARM TONGUE
SHOULD AID IN CHANGEOVER TO RAIN BY THU AFTN. SNOW GROUND COVER MAY
BECOME SLUSHY BUT MODEL QPF SUPPORTS HIGH END SNOW AMOUNTS IN 
CURRENT WSW. SFC LOW TREKS TO THE NE AS MID LEVEL JET STRENGTHENS SE 
OF MRX CWA. SECOND JET SEGMENT STRENGTHENS FM AR TO E KY PROVIDED 
LIFT ALONG LOW LEVEL TROUGH WHICH SLIDES SE INTO MRX THU NGT AND 
FRI. PCPN WILL LIKELY CHANGE BACK TO ALL SNOW BEFORE ENDING ACROSS 
NE MRX CWA ON FRI. BROAD TROUGHING CONTINUES OVER E U.S. THROUGH 
PERIOD KEEPING A LOCK ON COLD PATTERN. IMPULSES IN THE NW FLOW WILL 
LIKELY BRING SCT SN SHOWERS FROM TIME TO TIME ACROSS N PART OF MRX 
CWA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. A CLIPPER MAY BRING MORE WIDESPREAD 
COVERAGE ON MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...DRY WEATHER EXPECTED TO 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PER MODEL AND SREF CONSENSUS. 
VIGOROUS NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE CONTINUES TO TRANSLATE THROUGH 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. LACK OF MOISTURE WITH THIS FEATURE 
PRECLUDES POPS...BUT REINFORCEMENT OF COLD AIR WILL FOLLOW TONIGHT. 
TEMPS AGAIN EXPECTED TO BE WELL BELOW CLIMO AS THE REINFORCING COLD 
AIR BECOMES ENTRENCHED. SHOULD START TO SEE HIGH CLOUDS ADVECT INTO 
THE AREA DURING THE SECOND PERIOD AS NEXT MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM 
APPROACHES. FOR TEMPS...GFS GUIDANCE APPEARS REASONABLE AND WAS 
FOLLOWED CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...WHAT A MESSY
FORECAST. SOME MINOR BUT EXTREMELY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN
THE NAM AND GFS FORECASTS IN THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT-THURSDAY
TIMEFRAME. GFS FASTER AND A LITTLE COOLER AT THE OFFSET AND THIS IS
SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO GENERATE MORE SNOW OVER THE REGION. GFS
GENERALLY HANDLES ISENTROPIC LIFT SITUATIONS BETTER SO HAVE LEANED
HEAVILY IN THIS DIRECTION FOR THE FORECAST.  

TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO CLIMB INTO THE EVENING THURSDAY AND MANY
AREAS WILL SWITCH OVER TO RAIN THE POSSIBLY CHANGE BACK TO LIGHT
SNOW LATE THURSDAY NIGHT OR FRIDAY MORNING.

TWO MORE SMALL SYSTEMS SWINGING THROUGH...ONE OVER THE WEEKEND AND
ANOTHER AROUND TUESDAY.  

THE NEXT SITUATION TO PAY CLOSE ATTENTION TO IS THE POTENTIAL FOR
SIGNIFICANT COLD AIR FILTERING INTO THE REGION EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE OVER N

PRESSURE WILL SLIDE SE INTO PA WITH COLD FRONT MOVING EAST THROUGH 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON. DECENT WAA IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT
YET LEANED TOWARD COOLER MOS VALUES OF THE WRF. ENOUGH MOISTURE AND LIFT
ASSOCIATED WITH FRONT TO MENTION LOW CHC OF LIGHT SNOW ALONG AND N OF

ACROSS THE AREA. WIDESPREAD TEMPS IN THE TEENS TONIGHT. DRY AIRMASS 
IN PLACE WED SO LEANED TOWARD HIGH SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE WHICH STILL 
LEAVES TEMPS AROUND 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. DEVELOPING SURFACE LOW 
OVR TX WED NGT WITH ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE WILL BEGIN 
WORKING IN OVERNIGHT. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL PRODUCE LIGHT SNOW THAT 
WILL ADVANCE E INTO THE AREA. SURFACE LOW MOVES ENE THROUGH THE 
DEEP SOUTH ON THU. ELEVATED WAA WILL CHANGE PCPN TYPE TO RAIN DURING 
THE DAY ON THU FM SW-NE. CHANCE OF HAZARDOUS WINTER WEATHER ON THE 
RISE SINCE MANY LOCATIONS WILL REMAIN AT OR BELOW FREEZING MUCH OF 
THU. PWS JUMP TO .75 SO PCPN RATES WILL LIKELY BECOME MODERATE AT 
TIMES. SNOW WILL CHANGE TO FREEZING RAIN BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN BY 
THU AFTN. PCPN AMOUNTS AND FREEZING RAIN DURATION COULD RESULT IN 
ICE ACCUMULATIONS OF ONE TENTH OF AN INCH TO AS HIGH AS ONE QUARTER 
OF AN INCH. SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS OF NE TN AND SW 
VA APPEAR TO BE AROUND 1-2 INCHES AT THIS TIME. CONFIDENCE IN THE 
PCPN EVENT IS HIGH. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER ON 
THU WILL DETERMINE THE EXTENT OF THE WINTRY WEATHER POTENTIAL.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THURSDAY NIGHT
WRF MODEL SHOWS ELEVATED WARM LAYER SHOULD HAVE SCOURED OUT MOST
OF THE SUB FREEZING AIR NEAR THE SURFACE EXCEPT ACROSS THE
NORTHEAST SECTIONS...MAINLY VALLEYS ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA AS COLD
FRONT APPROACHES. COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH AND PRECIPITATION WILL DECREASE
DURING THE NIGHT. GFS DEVELOPS SURFACE LOW MORE AND HAS IT FARTHER
SOUTH THAN THE WRF. GFS A LITTLE TOO QUICK WITH COLDER AIR LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT. PREFER WRF SOLUTION OF DELAYING THE UPPER TROUGH
AND COLDER AIR ALOFT UNTIL FRIDAY. KEPT LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT
GENERALLY ABOVE FREEZING. WEAKENING SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL MOVE
ACROSS TN VALLEY AS TROUGH DIGS SOUTH WITH A CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS
AND POSSIBLY SNOW SHOWERS AS FREEZING LEVELS LOWER. HIGHS SHOULD BE
IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S. HIGH PRESSURE FROM CANADA BUILDS
SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE PLAINS AND INTO THE SOUTHEAST BY SATURDAY AND
CONTINUES SUNDAY WITH ANOTHER COLD AIRMASS. LOWS ARE EXPECTED TO
DROP INTO THE TEENS TO NEAR 20 AGAIN SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY
NIGHT. A COUPLE OF SHORTWAVES WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST WITH NW UPPER
FLOW FROM SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA INTO THE PLAINS AND THE TN VALLEY
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY AND WITH TEMPERATURES STILL COLD ANOTHER

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...BRIEF LULL EXPECTED THROUGH 
THE SHORT TERM IN CONTINUED PROGRESSIVE UPPER AIR PATTERN. MAIN 
ISSUE IS THE EFFECT THE NEXT IN A SERIES OF WEAK...FAST-MOVING 
NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVES WILL HAVE LATE IN THE SHORT TERM. 
MOISTURE WITH THIS FEATURE IS PROJECTED TO BE VERY 
LIMITED...CONFINED TO A SHALLOW LAYER AROUND 850 MB PER MODEL TIME 
HEIGHT SECTIONS. LIFT ALSO UNIMPRESSIVE. BASED ON THESE 
PARAMETERS...APPEARS THAT CLOUDS WILL BE ABOUT THE ONLY IMPACT OTHER 
THAN ANOTHER REINFORCEMENT OF COLD AIR BEING USHERED IN. FOR 
TEMPS...GFS GUIDANCE APPEARS REASONABLE AND WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...A CONTINUED COOL 
PERIOD WITH PERIODIC RE-ENFORCING BLASTS OF COLD AIR EVERY FEW 
DAYS.  SOME OF THESE BLASTS WILL BE ACCOMPANIED WITH 
PRECIPITATION...THE MOST NOTABLE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY.  
AS ALWAYS THIS TIME OF YEAR...THE BIG QUESTION WILL BE THE EXACT 
TIMING WHICH WILL IMPACT PRECIPITATION TYPE.  

GFS AND NAM FAIRLY DIFFERENT WITH GFS FASTER AND WITH MORE 
LIKELYHOOD OF SNOW.  RIGHT NOW LEANING TOWARDS THAT SOLUTION AND 
WILL ISSUE AN OUTLOOK UNDER THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT HEADING TO 
DISCUSS PROBABILITY AND POSSIBLE ACCUMULATIONS.  RIGHT NOW THINKING 
IS FOR VERY LIGHT AMOUNTS WITH KNOXVILLE NORTHWARD AROUND 1 
INCH...TAPERING UP TO THE TRI-CITIES AREA WHERE 1-2 INCHES 
POSSIBLE.  2-4 INCHES IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE SMOKIES AND 
OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.  FEEL THAT SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WILL BEGIN 
AS SNOW THEN SWITCH OVER TO RAIN EARLY IN THE MORNING WITH VERY 
LITTLE ACCUMULATION WITH THE POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF MONTEAGLE AND 
LOOKOUT/SIGNAL MOUNTAIN.

SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUING ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA...AS AN

STILL APPEARS NORMALLY FAVORED UPSLOPE SNOW AREAS MAY BE ABLE TO

IS WIND CHILL VALUES...WHICH SHOULD REACH ADVISORY CRITERIA OVER

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...LONG TERM CONTINUES TO

PROBLEMATIC AT BEST. APPEARS MEDIUM-RANGE MODELS AND ENSEMBLES ARE
IN SOMEWHAT REASONABLE AGREEMENT THAT A SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WILL
APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FROM THE SOUTHWEST WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. HAVE GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE NCEP (GFS) ENSEMBLES DEPICTION
OF THIS EVENT PROJECTING THE GREATEST CHANCE OF PRECIP IN THE LATE
THURSDAY/EARLY FRIDAY TIME FRAME. PRECIP TYPE ALSO IN QUESTION.
HAVE NOT TRIED TO GET TOO DETAILED WITH PRECIP TYPE...ADVERTISING
ONLY RAIN AND/OR SNOW AT THIS TIME.

HAVE OPTED TO GO DRY FOR THE BALANCE OF THE LONG TERM AS THE NCEP 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE IN NEAR UNANIMOUS AGREEMENT WITH THAT TREND. 
HOWEVER...A FEW OF THE OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SOME ENSEMBLE MEMBERS 
FROM OTHER MODELS PROJECT POSSIBLE PRECIP LATE IN THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD. SO CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH THAT DRY WEATHER WILL PREVAIL THEN 
EITHER.

AT ANY RATE...APPEARS AMPLIFIED RIDGE WEST/BROAD TROUGH EAST UPPER 
AIR PATTERN WILL PERSIST THROUGH THE LONG TERM RESULTING GENERALLY 
IN BELOW CLIMO TEMPS...PUNCTUATED BY BRIEF MODERATING TRENDS 
PRECEDING APPROACHING SYSTEMS. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE 
CLOSELY FOR TEMPS. A SLIGHT MAJORITY OF THE NCEP ENSEMBLE MEMBERS 
DEPICT SOME RELAXATION OF THE AMPLIFIED UPPER AIR FLOW THE FOLLOWING 
WEEK SUGGESTING SOME MODERATION IN TEMPS POSSIBLE. WILL HAVE TO SEE 
IF THIS TREND CONTINUES OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL MODEL RUNS.

RADAR SHOWING INCREASE IN LIGHT RETURNS DURING LAST HOUR...SO
CURRENT FORECAST FOR SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK.

DEEPER MOISTURE MOVES OFF TO THE EAST. UPSTREAM TEMPS AND DPS VERIFY
COLD AIR ADVECTION IS VERY STRONG. BREEZY NW WINDS ON TRACK FOR 
TODAY WITH LITTLE CHANGE IN POST FRONTAL TEMPS. DEEP LAYER TROUGH 
SWINGS THROUGH AREA TONIGHT. VERY COLD 850MB TROUGH WILL BRING IN 
TEMPS AROUND -15C IN THAT LEVEL. AVAILABLE MOISTURE WILL BE 
SUFFICIENT FOR GOOD FLUFFY SNOW PRODUCTION TONIGHT ACROSS THE SNOW 
ADVISORY AREA. WIDESPREAD WIND CHILL READINGS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS 
TONIGHT. WINDS ARE PROGGED TO SLACKEN LATER TONIGHT BUT A WIND CHILL 
ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED WITH A LATER PACKAGE. LEANED TOWARD COOLER 
WRF MOS FOR TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CONTINUES 
TO PULL AWAY FROM THE REGION ON MONDAY WITH FLOW ALOFT BECOMING 
ZONAL.  CONFIDENCE REMAINS LOW FOR REST OF EXTENDED AS A SERIES OF

UNSETTLED THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD AND TIMING OF SYSTEMS 
IN QUESTION.  CURRENTLY WILL HAVE COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT EXTENDING FROM THE UPPER 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY SOUTHWEST TO NEAR NASHVILLE AND MEMPHIS. SUB- 
FREEZING COLDER AIR REMAINS OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY 
THIS EVENING...BUT MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS COLDER AIR MASS WILL 
REACH THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNRISE. SUB-FREEZING AIR ALOFT WILL MOVE 
OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS SOONER...WITH LIGHT RAIN CHANGING OVER 
TO LIGHT SNOW SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. LOCAL RADARS ARE CURRENTLY NOT 
SHOWING MUCH PRECIP OVER THE FORECAST AREA OR UPSTREAM OVER WEST AND 
MIDDLE TN. BOTH THE GFS AND WRF MODELS INDICATE THAT MOISTURE WILL 
REMAIN LIMITED OVERNIGHT...BUT UPSLOPE FLOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
WILL LIKELY CREATE ADDITIONAL PRECIP OVERNIGHT AS AN UPPER-LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE SWINGS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 

OVERALL...PRECIP AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIGHT OVERNIGHT...BUT WILL 
CONTINUE THE SNOW ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE A COUPLE 
OF INCHES OF SNOW COULD ACCUMULATE BEFORE SUNRISE. A STRONG UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH ON SUNDAY SHOULD TRIGGER ADDITIONAL SNOW SHOWERS...AS 
LOW-LEVEL LAPSE RATES STEEPEN. ALL IN ALL...WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST 
THIS EVENING MAINLY TO FRESHEN-UP THE WORDING...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A 
LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

WARM AIR ADVECTION IN ADVANCE OF SYSTEM. MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES EARLY 
WILL RESULT IN A PLEASANT DAY WITH WIDESPREAD TEMPS IN THE 50S WITH 
SOME 60S. HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE MOVES IN RAPIDLY THIS EVENING. LARGE 
RAIN SHIELD WILL AFFECT MOST AREAS BY MIDNIGHT. SURFACE COLD FRONT 
MOVES SE THROUGH AREA TONIGHT IN WAKE OF DEPARTING SHORT WAVE. 
PRECIPITATION WILL CHANGE RAPIDLY TO SNOW ACROSS MOST AREAS BEFORE 
DAYBREAK. DEEPER MOISTURE DECREASES EARLY ON SUNDAY SO SIGNIFICANT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE NOT EXPECTED. SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES WILL 
CONTINUE ON SUNDAY AS SOME ADDITIONAL MID LEVEL MOISTURE MOVES EAST 
ACROSS AREA IN ADVANCE OF A DEEP TROUGH THAT SWINGS THROUGH LATER ON 
SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STRUGGLE TO WARM UP MUCH ABOVE FREEZING 
SUNDAY. BRISK NW WINDS WILL RESULT IN WIND CHILLS IN THE 20S.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPSLOPE CONDITIONS WILL 
CONTINUE INTO MONDAY NIGHT...KEEPING A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS GOING  
OVER EASTERN MOUNTAINS.  OTHERWISE...DRY CONDITIONS WITH COLDER AIR 
CONTINUING TO SLIDE THROUGH THE REGION.  OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL FALL 
INTO THE TEENS ACROSS THE VALLEY WITH SOME SINGLE DIGITS EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS.  WITH LOCALLY BREEZY CONDITIONS...SOME LOCATIONS COULD

TONIGHT AS ATMOSPHERE REMAINS RATHER DRY.  EXPECT HIGH 
CLOUDS AND THEN MID CLOUDS TO INCREASE TOMORROW AFTERNOON AHEAD OF 
THE NEXT COLD FRONT.  WHILE MOISTURE WILL INCREASE...ANY PRECIP 
SHOULD HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING IT TO THE SURFACE BY LATE SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON GIVEN DRY AIR INITIAL PRECIP WOULD HAVE TO FALL THROUGH 
AND WITH BETTER LIFT LOOKING LIKE IT WILL STAY TO OUR WEST AND

ZONES LATE.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE...SO NOT MUCH ARGUMENT 
THERE.  

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE 
LONG TERM IS EXTENT AND TYPE OF PRECIP FOR SATURDAY NIGHT. MODELS
AND SREF STILL IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS
SYSTEM...OTHER THAN SLIGHT TIMING DIFFERENCES (NAM/WRF SLIGHTLY
SLOWER THAN GFS). APPEARS AT THIS POINT THAT THIS WILL BE PRIMARILY
A RAIN EVENT IN THE VALLEY LOCATIONS BUT ENDING AS SNOW. IN SPITE
OF LIKELY POPS MOST LOCATIONS...THIS EVENT DOES NOT APPEAR VERY
SIGNIFICANT WITH GFS...NAM/WRF AND ALL SREF ENSEMBLE MEMBERS
PROJECTING LESS THAN 0.1 INCH QPF. THUS INCLINATION IS TO NOT ISSUE
ANY WATCHES AT THIS TIME.

UPSLOPE FLOW SETS UP FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT WITH ACCOMPANYING 
SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN. GENERALLY DRY ALBEIT COOL 
WEATHER RETURNS FOR EARLY NEXT WORK WEEK BEFORE ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM 
APPROACHES ON LATE TUESDAY. MODELS DIVERGE SOMEWHAT AT THIS POINT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...SURGE OF COLD AIR WILL CONTINUE 
TO PUSH INTO THE AREA EARLY THIS EVENING...THEN WILL BEGIN TO SHIFT 
EAST.  CURRENT RADAR AND OBS SHOW A DIMINISHING TREND FOR THE SNOW 
SHOWERS/FLURRIES.  EXPECT THIS TREND TO CONTINUE...SO WILL DROP SNOW 
ADVISORY EARLY.  ANY LEFTOVER SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES SHOULD END 
THIS EVENING...WILL JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN SW VA AND THE 
TN MOUNTAINS...AND SHOULD SEE CLEARING SKY. WIND CHILLS MAY REACH TO 
NEAR OR BELOW -5 LATE TONIGHT OVER SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT 
DO NOT THINK IT WILL BE WIDESPREAD AND PERSISTENT ENOUGH TO ISSUE A 
WIND CHILL ADVISORY.  SHOULD BE A DRY DAY FRI WITH PLENTY OF 
SUNSHINE...ALONG WITH MILDER AFTERNOON TEMPS.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE FOR BOTH TONIGHT AND FRIDAY.  

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...GENERALLY QUITE 
WEATHER EXPECTED THROUGH THE LONG TERM WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
OCCASIONAL SHORT WAVE TROUGHS PASSING THROUGH THE REGION. FIRST 
SHORT WAVE APPROACHES LATE SATURDAY PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE 
CONSENSUS. MODEL GUIDANCE POPS ARE RELATIVELY HIGH FOR THE SATURDAY 
NIGHT PERIOD...AND HAVE NO REASON NOT TO BELIEVE THEM. ACTUALLY WENT 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE GUIDANCE FOR THAT TIME FRAME BASED ON UNANIMOUS 
AGREEMENT AMONG OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SREF. ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE 
APPROACHES LATE IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD...BUT TIMING DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN MODELS AND ENSEMBLES LOWERS CONFIDENCE REGARDING POPS. AFTER 
A BRIEF WARMING TREND ON SATURDAY...TEMPS WILL GENERALLY TEND TO 
REMAIN BELOW CLIMO THROUGH THE LONG TERM.

.DISCUSSION...
A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE FROM THE OHIO VALLEY...CENTRAL
APPALACHIANS TO VA/NC BY LATE TODAY. DECENT COLD AIR ALOFT
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SYSTEM WILL PRODUCE SCATTERED-BROKEN SNOW
SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH BEST LIFT
ALONG THE NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES DUE TO NORTHWEST FLOW.

AFTER COORDINATION WITH SURROUNDING OFFICES...HAVE ISSUED A SNOW
ADVISORY FOR PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHERN-CENTRAL
MOUNTAINS OF FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE. SNOWFALL OF 1 TO 2 INCHES
EXPECTED...MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

ACROSS TRI...FLURRIES AND SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ANTICIPATED
TODAY...BUT PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS VERY LIGHT WITH NO SNOW
ACCUMULATION.

SHORT-WAVE WILL EXIT THE AREA THIS EVENING WITH CLEARING AND COLD
CONDITIONS.

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS
THE GULF COAST STATES FOR SUNDAY WITH A NORTHERN STREAM WAVE MOVING
EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. ANOTHER RE-ENFORCING COLD FRONT WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE MOVES ACROSS LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY WITH A
CHANCE OF SNOW/RAIN SHOWERS. AT THIS TIME...PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS
WILL BE LIMITED SINCE LITTLE IF ANY PHASING BETWEEN THE NORTHERN
AND SOUTHERN STREAM WAVES.

FOR THE EXTENDED...A SERIES OF ALBERTA CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEMS MAY
PRODUCE SOME LIGHT SNOW NEXT WEEK...BUT MOISTURE LIMITED.

FORECAST TO DROP INTO THE EASTERN LONG WAVE TROUGH TONIGHT AND THU.  
A REINFORCING SURGE OF COLD AIR WILL PUSH INTO THE REGION THU...AND 
WITH THE NORTHWEST FLOW AND COLDER AIR THERE SHOULD BE SOME SNOW 
SHOWERS AND FLURRIES.  APPEARS THAT MODEL LOW LEVEL THERMAL AND 
MOISTURE PROFILES ARE NOT IDEAL FOR A MAJOR SNOW SHOWER EVENT.  WILL 
GO WITH FLURRIES IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY...SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND NORTHERN VALLEY...WITH POPS UP TO 50 PERCENT 
FOR SOME OF THE MORE FAVORED HIGH TERRAIN.  EXPECT AT LEAST SOME 
ACCUMULATION IN THE USUAL LOCATIONS...SO WILL MENTION AN INCH OR 
TWO.  WITH CONFIDENCE STILL FAIRLY LOW...AND WITH THIS BEING MAINLY 
A PERIOD TWO EVENT...WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY ADVISORY...AND JUST 
CONTINUE THE SPS.  WITH COLD ADVECTION AND EXPECTED CLOUD COVER WILL 
UNDERCUT GFS MOS TEMPS A BIT FOR THU...BUT WILL GO CLOSE FOR 
TONIGHT.   

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LONG WAVE TROUGH
SHIFTS EAST THURSDAY NIGHT WITH MOISTURE DECREASING ALTHOUGH
ANOTHER HALF INCH OR MORE SNOW MAY FALL IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS
THROUGH THE EVENING. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING. RIGHT NOW EXPECTING WINDS TO
STAY BELOW ADVISORY LEVELS BUT WITH TEMPERATURES DROPPING INTO THE
SINGLE DIGITS AND TEENS ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND NORTH WIND
CHILL READINGS WILL BE BELOW ZERO THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY
MORNING. FOLLOWED A BLEND FOR LOWS FRIDAY MORNING AND THE COOLER
NAM GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS WITH COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUING THROUGH
THE MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AND THIS
WILL CAUSE A NICE WARMUP BEFORE THE NEXT SYSTEM DROPS DOWN IN THE
NORTHWEST FLOW FROM CENTRAL CANADA AND COMBINES WITH MOISTURE IN
THE SOUTHERN STREAM FROM AN UPPER LOW THAT MODELS SHOW TO MOVE FROM
WESTERN MEXICO INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS FRIDAY NIGHT AND THEN
COMBINE WITH THE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES SATURDAY. SATURDAY
SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY WITH CLOUDS INCREASING SATURDAY NIGHT AND
PRECIPITATION DEVELOPING BY SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE
COLD ENOUGH LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY FOR SNOW AS UPPER FLOW
COMES FROM THE NORTH. A SECONDARY SURGE OF COLD AIR AND MOISTURE WILL
SWING THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT WITH ANOTHER CHANCE OF SNOW MAINLY
NORTH. AIRMASS DRIES OUT BRIEFLY MONDAY AND THEN ANOTHER SHORTWAVE
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT DROPPING FROM THE NORTHWEST WILL GIVE
ANOTHER CHANCE OF SNOW. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY COLD FROM SUNDAY
THROUGH MIDWEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
LIGHT SNOW ASSOCIATED WITH A VORT MAX ACROSS KENTUCKY MAY CLIP OUR
NORTHERN BORDER TODAY. DO NOT EXPECT MUCH OF ANY ACCUMULATION WITH
THIS CLIPPER...AND WILL HAVE ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP ALONG OUR
NORTHERN FRINGE. WILL UNDERCUT MOS TEMPS TODAY AS TEMPS THIS
MORNING ARE COLDER THAN FORECAST AND CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE THROUGH
THE DAY. A DEEPER AND COLDER UPPER TROUGH WILL SWING THROUGH THE
AREA TONIGHT AND THURSDAY. UPPER DIVERGENCE INCREASES AS THE UPPER
JET SHIFTS EAST AND MIDLEVEL TEMPERATURES DROP SHARPLY. THIS WILL
RESULT IN LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES AROUND 9-10 C/KM ON
THURSDAY...AND ALONG WITH AN UPSLOPE 850 MB WIND AROUND 30 KTS
SHOULD PRODUCE A GOOD CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS IN SW VA AND THE
MOUNTAINS. THE NAM SHOWS DEEPER MOISTURE AND THUS HIGHER POPS THAN
THE GFS. WILL FOLLOW THE NAMS HIGHER POPS. AMOUNTS ARE UNCERTAIN
AT THIS TIME...BUT WILL KEEP AMOUNTS UNDER FOUR INCHES AS AN AREAL
AVERAGE IN SW VA AND THE MOUNTAINS. SOME HEAVIER SNOW BURSTS COULD
PRODUCE ISOLATED HIGHER AMOUNTS. WILL ISSUE AN SPS TO HIGHLIGHT
THIS. WILL ALSO INCLUDE A MENTION OF SUB-ZERO WIND CHILLS IN THE
MOUNTAINS ON THURSDAY NIGHT...AS LOW TEMPS COULD APPROACH SINGLE
DIGITS AND WINDS OF 20 TO 30 MPH IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE WESTERLY ON FRIDAY...AND A SHORTWAVE
TROUGH APPROACHES ON SATURDAY. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS WITH THIS
FEATURE. ANOTHER SURGE OF ARCTIC AIR WILL PUSH TOWARD THE AREA ON
SUNDAY. PATTERN APPEARS FAVORABLE FOR ANOTHER NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW
SHOWER EVENT ON SUNDAY NIGHT...WILL INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
FOR NOW. TEMPS MONDAY WILL LIKELY BE WELL BELOW NORMAL. YET ANOTHER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
LIGHT PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH A CHANNELED VORT MAX HAS ENDED.
MOISTURE TRAPPED BELOW A STRONG INVERSION AT 850 MB WILL HOLD THE
CLOUDS IN PLACE THIS MORNING. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE
INVERSION WEAKENING THIS AFTERNOON...SO BY THIS EVENING WE SHOULD
SEE AT LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. HOWEVER MIDLEVEL CLOUDS WILL BE
INCREASING AGAIN LATE TONIGHT WITH THE APPROACH OF A CLIPPER FROM
THE NORTHWEST. COOLING TEMPS ALOFT ALONG WITH A VERY STRONG JET
STREAM OVERHEAD WILL BRING SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOWER CHANCE POPS
BEGINNING WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 850 MB TEMPS DROP LATE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...WHILE WINDS AT THAT LEVEL ALSO INCREASE TO 30+ KTS FROM THE
NORTHWEST. THIS UPSLOPE FLOW ALONG WITH LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES ON
THE ORDER OF 9 C/KM WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN HALF AND THE SMOKIES THROUGH THURSDAY. THERE WILL LIKELY
BE A LARGE TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE FROM CHA TO SW VA AS 850 MB TEMPS
RANGE FROM -1 C TO -13. THE WIND CHILL WILL ALSO BE A FACTOR WITH
LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT IN THE TEENS AND NORTHWEST WINDS 20 TO 35 MPH.
WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS IN THE HWO.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE REGION ON FRIDAY...ALLOWING
TEMPERATURES TO RECOVER TO NEAR NORMAL BY SATURDAY. THE RIDGE
FLATENS AS IT MOVES EAST AND A SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSES THE AREA ON

311 PM EST MON JAN 22 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SHORTWAVE DEEPENS TROUGH
THAT IS CURRENTLY SETTING UP OVER THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY.
STUBBORN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE KEPT FOG AROUND UNTIL LATE MORNING.
TEMPERATURES THIS AFTERNOON ARE IN THE UPPER 30S PLATEAU AND HIGHER
ELEVATIONS AND LOWER TO MID 40S VALLEYS. A NORTHWEST FLOW TYPE
SHORT WAVE SHOULD GIVE THE MOUNTAINS A DUSTING TO ABOUT AN INCH OF
SNOW LATER TONIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING BUT VALLEY LOCATIONS ARE
EXPECTED TO SEE JUST CLOUDY SKIES BUT MAYBE A SNOW FLURRY IN THE
CENTRAL VALLEY LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY. SKIES WILL STAY
CLOUDY TONIGHT BUT SHOULD HAVE SOME BREAKS TUESDAY AS THE LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE MOVES OUT. LOWS TONIGHT WILL DROP SLOWLY TO AROUND
FREEZING IN THE VALLEYS AND AS LOW AS MID 20S AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS.
WITH SOME WIND AND LOW CLOUDS FOG SHOULD NOT BE A PROBLEM. HIGHS
TUESDAY WILL BE NEAR NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR IN THE 40S TO
NEAR 50.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...A NUMBER OF 
RE-ENFORCING SHORT WAVES MOVING THROUGH THE AREA OVER THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS.  SOME SMALL AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE OFF AND ON ASSOCIATED WITH 
THESE AND SOME SNOW FLURRIES ARE POSSIBLE AS THEY MOVE THROUGH.  
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN COOL INTO THE WEEKEND AS THESE SHORT WAVES 
ARE EMBEDDED IN A LARGER UPPER TROUGH WITH STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW.  
HELD CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE WITH SOME MINOR DEVIATIONS ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY.  PRECIPITATION NUMBERS THERE MUCH LOWER THAN 
EXISTING FORECAST AND FUDGED UPWARD TO ACCOUNT FOR THESE 
DIFFERENCES.

ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WEDGED ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH SUB-FREEZING TEMPS REMAINING 
EAST OF THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS. TEMPS OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
ARE ABOVE FREEZING...AND RECENT PHONE CALLS TO THE MOUNTAIN AREAS

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A HIGH PRESSURE AREA WEDGED ALONG THE 
EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE GULF COASTAL REGION. TEMPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA HAVE 
REMAINED WARM AND GENERALLY ABOVE FREEZING THIS MORNING. CALLS FROM 
AROUND THE FORECAST AREA REVEAL THAT SOME RAIN MIXED WITH SLEET IS 
STILL BEING OBSERVED ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TN. 
ALSO...REPORTS FROM THE SMOKIES INDICATE THAT TEMPS AT NEWFOUND GAP 
ARE BELOW FREEZING. THINK THAT A SUB-FREEZING AIR MASS OVER THE 
CAROLINAS IS SPILLING OVER THE MOUNTAINS THROUGH SOME OF THE PASSES. 
WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL KEEP THE WINTER WX ADVISORY GOING 
ACROSS THE FAR EASTERN TN BORDER AREAS...BUT CANCEL IT ELSEWHERE. 
TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY RISE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AS A WARM

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ALTHOUGH AREA RADARS SHOW PRECIP 
OVER MUCH OF THE AREA...VERY LITTLE IS REACHING THE GROUND AT THIS 
TIME. MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT REMAINS CONFINED TO ABOVE 5 KFT. 
SURFACE TEMPS HAVE BEEN HOLDING ABOVE FREEZING IN MOST LOCATIONS 
EXCEPT SW VA AND NE TN...BUT AS THE LOW LEVELS COOL FROM 
EVAPORATION...TEMPS WILL LIKELY DROP A LITTLE. THE WET-BULB ZERO 
LINE IS CURRENTLY LOCATED FROM MORGAN COUNTY TO KNOXVILLE THROUGH 
BLOUNT COUNTY...SO THERE IS STILL SOME ICING POTENTIAL NORTH OF THIS 
LINE. THE 00Z OHX SOUNDING INDICATES A DEEP ABOVE-FREEZING 
LAYER...WHICH MAY ALSO COOL SLIGHTLY FROM EVAPORATION. THE WARM NOSE 
AND SURFACE TEMPS SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL RAIN IN THE SOUTHERN 
AND CENTRAL VALLEY. PRECIP IN THE ADVISORY AREA IS EXPECTED TO BEGIN 
AS LIGHT RAIN AND/OR SNOW WITH A QUICK CHANGE TO SLEET AND THEN 
FREEZING RAIN AS WARM ADVECTION IN THE 850-700 MB LAYER INCREASES. 
THE SURFACE WET-BULB ZERO LINE RETREATS QUICKLY AND SHOULD BE NORTH 
AND EAST OF OUR AREA BY NOON. THUS BY THE AFTERNOON THE CHANCES OF 
FROZEN PRECIP WILL BE NIL. FORTUNATELY...THE BEST LIFT HOLDS OFF 
UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. HAVE TRIMMED BACK THE END TIME OF THE ADVISORY 
TO NOON. SOME LIGHT SNOW AND SLEET ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN 
THE ADVISORY AREA...UP TO ONE INCH...WITH A LIGHT GLAZE OF ICE 
POSSIBLE ON TREES AND ELEVATED SURFACES. DO NOT EXPECT MAJOR 
PROBLEMS WITH ROADS...BUT CAUTION IS ADVISED. THE RAIN SHOULD TAPER 
OFF AFTER 00Z...AND STRONG MIDLEVEL DRYING SHOULD END ALL PRECIP 
BEFORE SUNRISE. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS 
INTO THE REGION ON MONDAY...MOISTURE LIMITED...WILL CARRY ONLY 20 
POPS FOR RAIN FOR MONDAY.  ANOTHER SHORTWAVE APPROACHES ON MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TUESDAY.  BEST MOISTURE TO THE NORTH...WILL KEEP 20 POPS 
GOING MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY FOR OUR NORTHERN ZONES.  A FRONT 
MOVES INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY AND LINGERS INTO THURSDAY.  
MOISTURE AND LIFT INCREASES WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS SURFACE LOW NEARS.  
WILL GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR WEDNESDAY MORNING AND CHANCE 
POPS FOR WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THURSDAY.  THICKNESSES INDICATE 
A WINTER MIX ON WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT THEN ALL SNOW ON 
THURSDAY.  DRY WEATHER RETURNS ON FRIDAY.  GFS INDICATING ANOTHER

SATURDAY DRY FOR NOW.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
230 PM EST SAT JAN 20 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
TEXAS GULF COASTAL REGION...WITH HIGH CLOUDS STREAMING NORTHEAST 
TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. THE GFS AND WRF MODELS HAVE EVIDENTLY 
AGREED TO DISAGREE WITH THE TIMING OF PRECIP FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY 
MORNING. THE GFS MODEL STILL REVEALS A FASTER SOLUTION AND BRINGS 
PRECIP INTO THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. THE WRF MODEL INDICATES 
THAT PRECIP WILL NOT BEGIN UNTIL AFTER SUNRISE SUNDAY MORNING... 
WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF WINTRY PRECIP FOR THE AREA AS TEMPS 
SLOWLY WARM DURING THE DAY. WILL CONTINUE ALONG THE PATH OF LEAST 
REGRET BY STICKING TO THE FASTER GFS SOLUTION...AND MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF WINTRY PRECIP LATE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. BOTH 
MODELS STILL INDICATE THAT A STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW 
(IN THE 850 TO 700 MB LAYER) WILL PUNCH WARM AIR ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA...SO THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE THE MOUNTAINS SHOULD WARM UP 
QUICKER THAN THE VALLEYS. THIS WARMER LAYER ALOFT WILL COMPLICATE 
PRECIP TYPES IN THE MORNING...AS THE COLDER AIR IN THE VALLEYS IS 
SLOW TO RETREAT. IT STILL APPEARS THAT TEMPS WILL RISE ABOVE 
FREEZING BY THE AFTERNOON...BUT OF COURSE...SOUTHWEST VA WILL BE THE 
LAST TO WARM ABOVE FREEZING AND CHANGE OVER TO RAIN (PROBABLY NOT 
UNTIL EARLY AFTERNOON). OVERALL...IT APPEARS THAT A LIGHT SLEET AND 
FREEZING RAIN MIXTURE (WITH LIGHT ICE ACCUMULATIONS) WILL BE 
POSSIBLE OVER THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA 
OVERNIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING...ALTHOUGH IT SHOULD BE SHORT-LIVED. 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...PRECIP WILL LIKELY BEGIN AS 
LIGHT SNOW SINCE A DEEPER SUB-FREEZING AIR MASS WILL RESIDE IN THESE 
NORTHERN AREAS. SOME MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS (OF 1 TO 2 INCHES) 
WILL BE POSSIBLE (MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA)...BEFORE THE SNOW 
GRADUALLY CHANGES OVER TO SLEET AND THEN FREEZING RAIN. SOME MINOR 
ICE ACCUMULATIONS (OF 1/10 INCH OR LESS) WILL BE POSSIBLE BEFORE THE 
FREEZING RAIN CHANGES OVER TO RAIN AS TEMPS WARM ABOVE FREEZING. AS 
FOR TEMPS...TONIGHTS MINS REMAIN TRICKY TO FORECAST...SINCE CLOUD 
COVER SHOULD HELP TO KEEP TEMPS FROM FALLING TOO QUICKLY...BUT 
EVAPORATIVE COOLING PROCESSES (DUE TO THE VERY DRY AIR MASS IN 
PLACE) AT THE ONSET OF THE PRECIP WILL LIKELY CAUSE SOME ADDITIONAL 
COOLING (WHICH IS USUALLY NOT FULLY ACCOUNTED FOR BY THE MODELS). 
WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN FOR TEMPS TO BE AROUND FREEZING 
IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS...BUT DEFINITELY ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN AREAS. WITH LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED IN THE MORNING... 
THINK THAT AN ADVISORY WILL HANDLE THE SITUATION. NOT SURE ABOUT 
WHETHER THE SMOKIES WILL NEED AN ADVISORY (DUE TO THE STRONG WARM 
AIR ADVECTION EXPECTED ALOFT)...BUT AT THIS POINT...WILL PLAN TO 
KEEP THINGS AS IS. ONCE TEMPS RISE ABOVE FREEZING ON SUNDAY...THINK 
THAT RAIN WILL BE THE PREDOMINATE PRECIP TYPE THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. 
A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ON MONDAY WILL LIKELY KEEP CLOUDS AND A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR PRECIP IN THE FORECAST THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WILL CONTINUE WITH LOW POPS 
FAR NORTH ON TUESDAY AS A WEAK WAVE TRACKS THROUGH TO OUR NORTH. 
CONFIDENCE IS QUITE LOW FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH 
POOR MODEL CONSISTENCY. NEXT SYSTEM LOOKS TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION 
AROUND THE THURSDAY TIME FRAME. MOISTURE AND LIFT LOOKS MUCH MORE 
SIGNIFICANT THIS RUN AND TIMING AND POSITION STILL IN DOUBT. WILL 
INCREASE POPS A BIT FOR THIS SYSTEM AND HAVE POPS OF 20-40 PERCENT 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY FOR A RETURN TO DRY CONDITIONS.

315 PM EST FRI JAN 19 2007

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE OZARKS...WITH HIGH 
CLOUDS CONTINUING TO STREAM ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DUE TO AN 
ACTIVE SOUTHERN JET STREAM. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE 
SOUTHWEST IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ALONG THE GULF 
COAST ON SATURDAY. THE GFS AND WRF MODELS STILL INDICATE SOME TIMING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE ONSET OF PRECIP FOR THE FORECAST AREA...WITH 
THE GFS MODEL REVEALING A FASTER SOLUTION BY BEGINNING PRECIP ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TN LATE SATURDAY EVENING. WRF MODEL INDICATES THAT PRECIP 
WILL NOT BEGIN UNTIL LATE SUNDAY MORNING...WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE 
AMOUNT OF WINTRY PRECIP FOR THE AREA AS TEMPS SLOWLY WARM DURING THE 
DAY. THINK THAT THE BEST THING TO DO AT THIS POINT IS GO WITH THE 
GFS SOLUTION (PATH OF LEAST REGRET)...AND MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF 
WINTRY PRECIP ON SUNDAY MORNING. BOTH MODELS INDICATE A STRONG AND 
WARM SOUTHWESTERLY 850 MB PUNCHING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...SO 
THIS IS A SITUATION WHERE THE MOUNTAINS SHOULD WARM UP QUICKER THAN 
THE VALLEYS. ALSO...THIS WARM 850 MB LAYER WILL COMPLICATE PRECIP 
TYPES IN THE MORNING...AS THE COLDER AIR IN THE VALLEYS IS SLOW TO 
RETREAT. OVERALL...FEEL THAT RAIN WILL DEVELOP MOST EVERYWHERE BY 
LATE MORNING...AS TEMPS SLOWLY RISE. BUT OF COURSE...SOUTHWEST VA 
WILL BE THE LAST TO WARM AND CHANGE OVER TO RAIN...PROBABLY NOT 
UNTIL EARLY AFTERNOON. RIGHT NOW...IT APPEARS THAT A LIGHT FREEZING 
RAIN/SLEET MIXTURE WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL 
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...THERE IS STILL SOME 
QUESTION ABOUT HOW COLD TEMPS WILL ACTUALLY BE BY SUNRISE SUNDAY 
MORNING IN THE SOUTHERN AND EVEN CENTRAL AREAS. EVAPORATIVE COOLING 
PROCESSES WILL OCCUR DURING THE ONSET OF THE PRECIP...SINCE A VERY 
DRY AIR MASS WILL BE IN PLACE. WITH THIS IN MIND...THINK THAT SOME 
LIGHT ICE ACCUMULATIONS AROUND A TENTH OF AN INCH OR LESS MAY 
DEVELOP SUNDAY MORNING ACROSS MAINLY THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. IN ADDITION...THERE MAY BE SOME LIGHT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA OF AN INCH 
OR TWO. ALL OF THIS TRANSLATES INTO ADVISORY CRITERIA AMOUNTS...SO 
WILL CONTINUE WITH A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO ADDRESS THE 
SITUATION. ONCE TEMPS RISE ABOVE FREEZING ON SUNDAY...THINK THAT 
RAIN WILL BE THE PREDOMINATE PRECIP TYPE THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEATHER SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO 
PULL AWAY FROM THE REGION ON MONDAY...PROVIDING SOME LINGERING 
SHOWERS DURING THE MORNING HOURS. A WEAK WAVE TRACKS THROUGH TO OUR 
NORTH EARLY TUESDAY...MOISTURE AND LIFT QUITE LIMITED AND WILL HAVE 
ONLY SOME LOW POPS NORTHERN ZONES. ANOTHER WEAK WAVE MOVES THROUGH 
AROUND THE THURSDAY TIME FRAME AND WILL AGAIN KEEP POPS LOW AND 
CONFINED TO NORTHERN LOCATIONS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...LIGHT SNOW AND OR
FLURRIES POSSIBLE TONIGHT AS THE COLD AIR FILTERS INTO THE REGION
AND THE CLOUDS SLOWLY ERODE. CLOUDS MOSTLY GONE BY MID-DAY FRIDAY
THEN BEGIN A RETURN SATURDAY AFTERNOON IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT
WEATHER MAKER. BOTH GFS AND NAM CLOSE ON HANDLING THE NEXT SYSTEM
AND LEANED MAINLY TOWARDS GFS. SATURDAY NIGHT WILL SEE A BEGINNING
OF THE PRECIPITATION IN THE SOUTHWEST CORNER OF THE FORECAST AREA
SLOWLY SPREADING ACROSS THE REMAINDER OF THE AREA.  

THE BIG ISSUE WITH THE SYSTEM SATURDAY NIGHT...AND MOVING INTO THE
LONG TERM PERIOD...WILL BE HOW QUICKLY THE PRECIPITATION SPREADS IN
BEFORE TEMPERATURES BEGIN TO WARM. HAVE ISSUED A SPECIAL WEATHER
STATEMENT DEALING WITH THE UNCERTAINTIES FOR THIS SYSTEM. THE BIG
ISSUE IS THAT UNCERTAINTY BUT THE NECESSITY FOR THE PUBLIC TO BE
AWARE OF THE POSSIBLE THREAT.

UNDERCUT LOWS ON SATURDAY NIGHT A LITTLE DUE TO THE EVAPORATIONAL
COOLING THAT LIKELY WILL OCCUR AS THE PRECIPITATION BEGINS.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WEATHER SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH 
THE REGION ON SUNDAY.  TIMING OF SYSTEM WILL BE FACTOR IN PRECIP 
TYPE...AS WILL TEMP PROFILE.  A WIDE RANGE OF PRECIP TYPES WILL BE 
POSSIBLE AS THE SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH.  AT THIS TIME...LOOKS LIKE 
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEY WILL SEE A MIX OF SLEET/FREEZING RAIN EARLY 
MORNING...TURNING TO MAINLY RAIN FOR THE AFTERNOON.  PRECIP WILL 
MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN VALLEY DURING THE MORNING...PROVIDING MAINLY 
SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN INTO THE AFTERNOON...SLOWLY MIXING 
WITH/CHANGING TO RAIN LATE IN THE DAY.  HIGHER TERRAIN GENERALLY A 
MIX OF OF SNOW AND SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN.  A MIX OF PRECIP SHOULD 
DIMINISH IN COVERAGE SUNDAY NIGHT WITH SOME LINGERING INTO MONDAY.  
CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED.  CURRENT THINKING IS 
WE WILL BE GENERALLY BETWEEN SYSTEMS TUESDAY WITH UNSETTLED WEATHER 
RETURNING FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  WENT A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER 
THAN GUIDANCE MOST PERIODS.

FORECAST AREA EXCEPT FOR A FEW SPOTS IN SOUTHWEST VA. SATELLITE 
IMAGES REVEAL THAT AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN JET STREAM WILL CONTINUE TO

PRECIP IS PROBABLY NOT REACHING THE GROUND WITH A DRY LOW-LEVEL AIR

353 AM EST THU JAN 18 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN ISSUE FOR THE SHORT TERM IS 
POPS IN THE FIRST PERIOD. PLUME OF SOUTHERN STREAM MOISTURE 
CONTINUES TO STREAM JUST SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA. WEAK NORTHERN 
STREAM SHORT WAVE WILL PULL SOME OF THAT MOISTURE NORTHWARD DURING 
THE FIRST PERIOD. MODEL GUIDANCE DEPICTS RATHER HIGH POPS WITH OUR 
SOUTHEASTERN-MOST ZONES APPROACHING LIKELY CATEGORY. HOWEVER...DRY 
SURFACE LAYER COUPLED WITH UNIMPRESSIVE LIFT AND MOISTURE PROFILES 
SUPPORT THE CONCLUSION THAT THE GUIDANCE POPS ARE SOMEWHAT OVERDONE. 
SREF ALSO SUPPORTS THE LOWER POPS SCENARIO OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. 
THUS WILL CONTINUE TO DOWNPLAY POPS...ESPECIALLY NORTH AND WEST OF 
THE MOUNTAIN ZONES. UPPER LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH AXIS SWINGS 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THE SECOND PERIOD. WILL 
CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE NORTHEASTERN AND MOUNTAIN ZONES 
AS A BRIEF PERIOD OF UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS IS POSSIBLE.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...NO MAJOR CHANGES MADE FOR
THESE PERIODS...ALTHO AS TYPICAL...MODELS SHOW SLIGHT VARIANCES
FROM RUN TO RUN CONCERNING THE POTENTIALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT WINTERY
EVENT FOR SUNDAY INTO EARLY MONDAY. 18/00Z GFS RUN HAS TRENDED JUST
A BIT WARMER AND FASTER WITH PRECIPITATION (PCPN) DEVELOPING OVER
THE GULF COAST AND LOWER MISS VALLEY REGIONS. DID ADD SOME LOW POPS
JUST BEFORE DAYBREAK SUNDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. WARMER
MODEL RUN STILL OFFERS A MIX OF WINTRY PCPN TYPES...WITH GFS
SOUNDINGS INDICATING MAINLY RAIN OR SNOW EARLY SUNDAY FOR SE TN/SW
NC...GENERALLY A MIX OF RAIN/SNOW/SLEET FOR CENTRAL VALLEY AND
SMOKIES...AND PRIMARILY SNOW OR SLEET FOR NE PLATEAU/SW VA/NE TN
AREAS. THE WARMER AIR COULD POSE A LIGHT FREEZING RAIN THREAT EARLY
IN ANY SHELTERED VALLEYS...BUT OF COURSE THIS EVENT IS STILL TOO
FAR OFF TO JUSTIFY DETAILING PCPN TYPES...SO DECIDED TO STICK CLOSE
TO PCPN TYPES AS EARLIER ADVERTISED FOR LATER SUNDAY INTO MONDAY
MORNING. POPS AT HIGH CHANCE OR LOW LIKELY ALSO GOOD FOR NOW.

OTHERWISE...POPS LIMITED TO MAINLY NRN AREAS AND SMOKIES FRIDAY
LOOKED GOOD...BUT DID INCREASE WIND SPEEDS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS
NEAR RNK AND GSP ON FRIDAY. ENSEMBLES AND 18/00Z GFS SHOWING A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT TO AFFECT THE REGION TUESDAY...SO
POPS WERE ADDED TO ANY DRY AREAS FOR TUESDAY...WHICH ALSO BLENDED
BETTER WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES. CLOUDS...PCPN AND COLD AIR
ADVECTION AT TIMES MADE ME QUESTION THE WISDOM IN BLINDLY
POPULATING MAX TEMPS WITH NEW 18/00Z GFSX MOS VALUES...SO JUST SOME
TWEAKS ONE WAY OR ANOTHER FOR NOW.

WILL FRESHEN OUR SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT NEXT...WITH ALL TEXT AND
WEB PRODUCTS ALREADY ISSUED FOR THIS PACKAGE. THANKS TO NEIGHBORING

SOME LIGHT PRECIP HAS BEEN OBSERVED TO OUR SOUTH AND
SOUTHWEST...BUT HAS NOT MADE TOO MUCH PROGRESS TOWARD OUR AREA SO
FAR. TOUGH FORECAST TONIGHT...MODELS TRYING TO PUSH SOME LIGHT
PRECIP INTO OUR AREA...BUT THERE WILL BE QUITE A BIT OF DRY AIR TO
OVERCOME AND TRACK OF WEAK LOW WILL BE WELL TO OUR SOUTHEAST. IF
ANY PRECIP DOES OCCUR...PRECIP TYPE WILL BE PROBLEMATIC AS TEMPS
SHOULD BE NEAR OR BELOW FREEZING IN SOME SPOTS. NOT TOO CONFIDENT
WE WILL SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF PRECIP TONIGHT...BUT CURRENT POPS
ARE LOW SO WILL LEAVE POPS AND WEATHER (INCLUDING POSSIBILITY OF
FREEZING RAIN) AS THEY ARE FOR NOW. WILL TWEAK DATABASE TO FIT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND 
MID ATLANTIC STATES...EXTENDING ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN PART OF 
THE NATION. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL EXTENSIVE CLOUDINESS ACROSS THE 
DEEP SOUTH...AS AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN JET STREAM CONTINUES FROM OVER 
THE EASTERN PACIFIC. GFS AND WRF MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
DEVELOPING A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OFF THE SOUTHEAST GA COAST LATE 
TONIGHT...WITH A VERY DRY AIR MASS REMAINING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
ISENTROPIC LIFT IS PROGGED TO INCREASE OVER GA AND THE CAROLINAS 
LATE TONIGHT...AS A COLD AIR DAMMING WEDGE DEVELOPS OVER THE 
CAROLINAS. THE NORTHWESTERN EDGE OF THIS PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO BRUSH 
SOUTHWEST NC AND FAR EASTERN TN TOWARDS SUNRISE...BUT PRECIP AMOUNTS 
SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A WARM 850 MB LAYER 
ABOVE FREEZING AT SUNRISE...SO THINK THAT ANY PRECIP WOULD BE IN THE 
FORM OF RAIN OR FREEZING RAIN. WITH THE DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE... 
EXPECT SOME EVAPORATIVE COOLING OF THE ATMOSPHERE AS PRECIP BEGINS. 
BOTH MODELS INDICATE THAT WET BULB TEMPS WILL BE BELOW FREEZING 
AROUND SUNRISE ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA...BUT TEMPS SHOULD 
QUICKLY RISE ABOVE FREEZING BEFORE NOON. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL 
CONTINUE WITH A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT MENTIONING LIGHT ICING 
POSSIBLE IN SOME AREAS OF SOUTHWEST NC AND FAR EASTERN TN TOWARDS 
SUNRISE. A COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING. MOISTURE IS EXPECTED 
TO BE LIMITED WITH THIS FRONT...SO WILL KEEP ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR SNOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FORECAST AREA SHOULD BE 
DRY ON SATURDAY AWAITING NEXT SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WHICH ADVANCES 
TOWARD THE MIDWEST SATURDAY NIGHT. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE EMERGES NEAR 
THE LOUISIANA COAST SUNDAY MORNING AND MOVES NORTH NORTHEAST TO THE 
CAROLINA COAST BY 12Z MONDAY. DIDNT TRY TO GET TOO FANCY WITH 
PREDICTING NUMEROUS VARIED PRECIP TYPES AS ATMOSPHERE COLD ENOUGH 
FOR FROZEN PRECIPITATION MAINLY SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MID DAY MONDAY. 
RAISED POPS FOR THE EVENT FOLLOWING THE GUIDANCE PROVIDED BY GFS. 
USED GOOD CHANCE FOR SUNDAY AND LIKELY POP FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AS 
SURFACE LOW/SHORTWAVE TROF BUILD ACROSS THE REGION. HELD ONTO SOME 
CHANCE AND SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITIES FOR RAIN/SNOW INTO DAYTIME 
PERIOD MONDAY. NEXT FEATURE OF INTEREST IS WEAK WAVE AND SURFACE 
FRONT DUE ON TUESDAY WHICH APPEARS TO IMPACT MAINLY NORTHERN 
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH EMPHASIS IN THE TERRAIN SO USED 
SLIGHT AND CHANCE POPS FOR RAIN/SNOW FOR THIS FEATURE WHICH DEPARTS

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY AND EXTENDING ACROSS MOST OF THE EASTERN PART OF THE 
NATION. SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN JET STREAM 
BRINGING HIGH CLOUDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. MOST OF 
THESE HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD BE TRANSPARENT...BUT WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE 
FORECAST THIS MORNING TO MENTION PARTLY SUNNY SKIES. TEMPS APPEAR TO 
BE ON TRACK FOR THE MOST PART...BUT WILL TWEAK THEM A LITTLE 
ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
402 AM EST WED JAN 17 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...GENERALLY DRY WEATHER EXPECTED 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS SOUTHERN STREAM MOISTURE GETS SHUNTED 
SOUTH TEMPORARILY PER MODEL/SREF CONSENSUS. SHORT WAVE RIDGE WILL 
TRANSLATE THROUGH THE REGION ERODING LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE AS IT 
APPROACHES. HOWEVER...PROJECTED UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE WILL LIKELY 
KEEP SCATTERED HIGH CLOUDS OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA PRECLUDING 
COMPLETELY CLEAR SKY CONDITIONS. MAIN CONCERN CENTERS AROUND LATE 
SECOND PERIOD WHEN SOUTHERN STREAM MOISTURE WORKS BACK INTO THE 
SOUTHERN TIER. MODELS AND SREF DEPICT COASTAL FEATURE FORMING DURING 
THIS TIME FRAME WITH LIGHT PRECIP NUDGING UP AGAINST OUR 
SOUTHEASTERN COUNTIES. HOWEVER...UNDERCUT GFS GUIDANCE POPS SOMEWHAT 
GIVEN EXPECTED DRY AIR IN THE LOW LEVELS WHICH WILL HAVE TO BE 
OVERCOME. FOR TEMPS...HAVE NO REASON TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE FROM 
GFS GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT
CHANGES MADE FOR THURSDAY...BUT CLEARLY THE MOST INTERESTING AND
POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT WEATHER EVENT IS STILL SHAPING UP FOR
SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. AN SPS WILL BE ISSUED TO HIGHLIGHT THIS
POSSIBLE WINTER WEATHER EVENT.

BOTH 17/00Z GFS AND NAM-WRF MODELS DEVELOPING WEAK SURFACE TROUGH
OR LOW PRESSURE JUST OFF THE SE COAST WED NIGHT INTO THU...WITH
SOME SLIGHT DIFFS ON HOW FAR WEST AND NORTHWEST PRECIPITATION FROM
THIS FEATURE SPREADS. SREF LENDS A SLIGHT BIT OF CREDIBILITY TO THE
MORE AGRESSIVE NAM-WRF THAN DRIER GFS LOOK FOR OUR AREA...ALTHO QPF
AS FAR W/NW AS OUR AREA MAY NOT AMOUNT TO MUCH AT ALL. THUS...WE
COMPROMISED SOME FOR LATE WED NIGHT INTO THU...AND INTRODUCED
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR ALL BUT OUR NE PLATEAU COUNTIES
INTO LEE AND WISE COUNTIES OF SW VA. PCPN-TYPE FROM THICKNESS TOOL
CLOSELY FOLLOWED FOR TYPE OF PRECIPITATION (PCPN).

VERY TEMPTED TO REMOVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FROM FRI AND FRI NIGHT
...AS I DONT SEE MUCH FORCING FOR PCPN (OTHER THAN SOME LOW LEVEL
UPSLOPE IN A FEW AREAS...MAINLY SW VA AND NE TN). HOWEVER...OPTED
TO SPEND MORE TIME ON SUNDAY INTO MONDAY PERIODS AND LET DAY SHIFT
TAKE ANOTHER LOOK AT THE EARLIER PERIODS OF THE EXTENDED.

OTHERWISE...THE MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM IS STILL ADVERTISED COMING
INTO PLAY BY SUNDAY MORNING. GFS SEEMS CONSISTENT FROM 24 HOURS IN
DEVELOPING A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY
AND TRACKING IT NE TOWARD THE CAROLINAS AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON
SUNDAY NIGHT. COLD AIR IN PLACE IN THE LOW LEVELS...AS WELL AS
PARTIAL THICKNESSES...OFFER A WINTRY MIX WITH SOME POTENTIAL FOR
SIGNIFICANT SNOWS FURTHER NORTH INTO OUR FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...
THIS IS A DAY 5 EVENT...SO MUCH TIME FOR THE TRACK...STRENGTH AND
TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM TO CHANGE.

POP AND WEATHER GRIDS CHANGED TO BRING THE PCPN IN SLIGHTLY EARLIER
ON SUNDAY...AND TEMPS WERE ADJUSTED A BIT FOR MOST DAYS AND NIGHTS
IN THE EXTENDED IN LINE WITH LATEST GFSX MOS AND NEIGHBORS UPDATED
GRIDS.

841 PM EST TUE JAN 16 2007

.DISCUSSION...
THE RUC MODEL APPEARS TO HAVE THE BEST HANDLE ON THE LOW CLOUDS
OVER THE AREA AND ON THE MIDLEVEL MOISTURE IN WESTERN NC. THE NAM
IS HANDLING THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE VERY POORLY. SOME SNOW SHOWERS
WERE AFFECTING SW VA AND EXTREME SW NC THIS EVENING. AS DRIER AIR
MOVES IN BEHIND THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH PASSAGE AFTER 06Z...THE LOW
CLOUDS SHOULD ERODE FROM THE TOP DOWN AND END ANY REMAINING PRECIP.
THE LOW LEVEL WINDS WILL ALSO VEER TO A MORE NORTHERLY DIRECTION
AFTER 06Z...LESS FAVORABLE FOR UPSLOPE ENHANCEMENT. WILL CONTINUE
A MENTION OF FLURRIES IN SW VA...SW NC...AND THE TN MOUNTAINS...BUT
NOTHING MEASURABLE IS EXPECTED SO POPS WILL BE REMOVED.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WED)...COLD ADVECTION WILL CONTINUE OVER 
THE AREA TONIGHT. HAVE NOT HAD MUCH IN THE WAY OF SNOW 
TODAY...REPORT OF JUST A LIGHT DUSTING AT NEWFOUND GAP. SHORT WAVE 
THAT WILL AFFECT THE REGION EARLY AND MIDDLE PARTS OF TONIGHT MAY 
HELP TO TOUCH OFF A FEW FLURRIES IN THE VALLEY (HAVE SEEN A FEW 
FLURRIES IN UPSTREAM OBS)...AND WILL KEEP 20 POPS GOING IN SOME OF 
THE FAVORED TERRAIN FOR EARLY TONIGHT. SHOULD SEE CLEARING LATER 
TONIGHT AND WED...BUT EXPECT SOME HIGH CLOUDS...ESPECIALLY SOUTH.  
WILL MAKE A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO GFS MOS TEMPS...BUT NO MAJOR 
ADJUSTMENTS.  

.LONG TERM...WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
IN BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY.  LATEST 
MODELS BRING A WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVING INTO THE REGION ON FRIDAY AND 
LINGERING INTO FRIDAY NIGHT.  GFS BRINGING MORE MOISTURE INTO THE  
REGION WITH IT.  WILL GO WITH THE DRIER NAM AND ONLY KEEP SLIGHT 
POPS FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.  COLD AIR PUSHES IN ON FRIDAY 
NIGHT...WILL MENTION MIXED PRECIPITATION FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. DRY WEATHER 
RETURNS ON SATURDAY.  A FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE AREA ON LATE 
SUNDAY...WILL ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  SURFACE 
LOW APPROACHES SUNDAY NIGHT WITH DECENT MOISTURE AND LIFT...WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT.  WITH COLD AIR PUSHING IN... 
SHOULD SEE MIXED BAG OF WINTRY PRECIPITATION ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY.  SYSTEM PUSHES EAST BY MONDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP MONDAY NIGHT 
DRY.  ANOTHER WEAK FRONT APPROACHES ON TUESDAY...BUT MOISTURE IS 
LIMITED...SO WILL KEEP TUESDAY DRY FOR NOW.  STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC 
GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
409 AM EST TUE JAN 16 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...OPERATIONAL MODELS AND SREF ARE 
IN RELATIVELY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. COLD FRONT 
CURRENTLY MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA WITH LIGHT PRECIP 
LINGERING BEHIND FRONT. MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT DRY AIR INTRUSION 
IN THE MID-LEVELS WITH LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE PERSISTING THROUGH THE 
FIRST PERIOD. ANTICIPATE CLOUDS TO PERSIST BUT PRECIP DIMINISHING 
THROUGH THE DAY. NON-IDEAL UPSLOPE FLOW REGIME AS LOW-LEVEL FLOW IS 
PROJECTED TO BE MAINLY NORTHERLY. WILL CONTINUE TO DOWNPLAY 
SNOWFALL. CLOUDS EXPECTED TO BEGIN TO BREAK UP DURING THE SECOND 
PERIOD. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STUCK CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE VALUES.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...GFS MODEL AND ENSEMBLES
IN FAIR AGREEMENT WITH NAM-WRF MODEL UNTIL THURSDAY...THEN SOME
UNCERTAINTY DEVELOPS IN THE PATTERN EXPECTED FROM THURSDAY INTO THE
WEEKEND. HOWEVER...BOTH GFS AND NAM-WRF GENERALLY AGREE ON WARM AIR
ADVECTION DEVELOPING OVER FL-GA-CAROLINAS AND AN AREA OF LIGHT RAIN
DEVELOPING AND SPREADING NE. MOST OF THIS RAIN IS PROGGED TO STAY
SOUTH AND EAST OF OUR FORECAST AREA...THUS DECIDED TO KEEP OUR
FORECAST DRY FOR NOW FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. 

NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT...OTHER
THAN TO SLIGHTLY ADJUST TEMPS IN LINE WITH 16/00Z GFS MOS. THESE
PERIODS LOOK MOSTLY DRY WITH A VERY TOKENISH 20 PERCENT POP
SUFFICIENT IN MOST AREAS.

THE MORE TROUBLESOME CHANGES HAD TO BE MADE FOR SUNDAY INTO MONDAY
...WHICH WERE NECESSITATED FOR A WETTER TREND IN GFS MODEL FOR THESE
PERIODS (ACCEPTED BY GENERALLY ALL NEIGHBORING OFFICES). A LARGE
AREA OF WARM AIR ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT IS NOW PROGGED TO
DEVELOP ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON SUNDAY AND SPREAD NE 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THIS IS FASTER THAN THE 850 MB TEMPS CAN
RECOVER ABOVE ZERO DEGREES CELSIUS...MAINLY ACROSS NE TN AND SWRN
VA AREAS. BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS AND SURFACE TEMPS WOULD APPEAR TO BE
COLD ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY ALLOW A WINTRY MIX TO OCCUR. DID NOT PLAY
THIS UP TOO MUCH JUST YET...BUT DID ALLOW FOR SOME 20 TO 40 PERCENT
POPS SUNDAY NIGHT AND A MENTION OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN POSSIBLE.
DAY SHIFT CAN LOOK THIS OVER AGAIN...CHECK FOR CONTINUITY...AND
POSSIBLY INCREASE POPS FOR MONDAY ABOVE THE SLIGHT CHANCE VALUES.

433 AM EST MON JAN 15 2007

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER SRN INDIANA THIS MORNING WITH TRAILING COLD FRONT STILL WELL TO 
OUR WEST (HAVING JUST EASED EAST OF MEM TO DYR LINE). INCREDIBLY 
MILD 08Z TEMPS ACROSS OUR FORECAST AREA...RANGING FROM LOW 60S AT 
CHA AND RHP TO A COOLER 46 DEGS AT TRI.

ONE MISSING WEATHER ITEM THIS MORNING...LIKE PAST FEW MORNINGS...IS 
ANY RAINFALL. NOT EVEN ANY SPRINKLES LIKELY UNDER STILL MOSTLY MID 
TO HIGH CLOUDS...WHICH HAD THINNED OVERNIGHT TO REVEAL STARRY SKIES.
BASED ON CURRENT RADAR AND SATELLITE PICS...DECISION WAS MADE TO 
SLOW DOWN THE ARRIVAL OF ANY SIGNIFICANT RAIN/SHOWERS UNTIL MAINLY 
THIS AFTERNOON (FOLLOWING THE LEAD OF THE 15/00Z NAM MODEL). GFS 
SEEMS MUCH TOO FAST IN SPREADING LIGHT SHOWERS EAST INTO OUR REGION 
THIS MORNING. STILL PAINTED IN HIGH POPS WESTERN MOST AREAS BY THIS 
AFTERNOON...INCLUDING LEE AND WISE COUNTIES OF SWRN VA TO MESH WITH 
HIGHER POPS FROM JKL. THINKING SHOWERS WILL ARRIVE SO LATE TO MTN 
ZONES THAT HIGH CHANCE POPS WILL BE SUFFICIENT IN THOSE EASTERN MOST 
AREAS. A LATE ARRIVAL OF RAIN TODAY...VERY MILD TEMPS TO START THE 
DAY...AND A MIX OF SUNSHINE AT LEAST EARLY...WHICH ALL FAVORS GOING 
ABOVE THE WARMER MOS MAX TEMPS FOR HIGHS TODAY. A FEW SPOTS MIGHT 
EVEN TOP UPPER 60S AGAIN TODAY...BUT STAYED BELOW 70 DEGREES SINCE 
GFS MOS ONLY GAVE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S.

FRONTAL PASSAGE LOOKS TO BE THIS EVENING...THEN POPS SHOULD START TO 
DECREASE FROM THE WEST BY MIDNIGHT. ADJUSTED POP/WX GRIDS TO REFLECT 
THIS AND ALSO BETTER MATCH UP WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES GRIDS. MAY 
GET COLD ENOUGH BY 09Z FOR A CHANGE OVER TO LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR 
FLURRIES ACROSS OUR NE PLATEAU COUNTIES...AS WELL AS LEE AND WISE 
COUNTIES OF SWRN VA. HIGHER ELEVATIONS MIGHT GET A LIGHT SNOWFALL 
TUESDAY...BUT GROUND WILL BE VERY WARM GIVEN PAST SEVERAL DAYS OF 
MUCH ABOVE NORMAL HIGHS...SO MOST SNOW SHOULD JUST FALL AND MELT.

THANKS TO NEIGHBORING NWS OFFICES FOR COORDINATION THIS MORNING.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...LONG ANTICIPATED COLD FRONT
WILL BRING MUCH COLDER AIR TO THE EAST TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY MORNING. EXPECT HIGH TEMPERATURES TO
BE EARLY IN THE DAY AND NEAR THE LOWS MONDAY NIGHT AS STRONG COLD
AIR ADVECTION BRINGS A MORE WINTER LIKE DAY TO THE FORECAST AREA.
FREEZING LEVELS WILL DROP TO NEAR THE SURFACE NORTH TO AROUND 2000
FEET SOUTH AND THE RAIN SHOWERS WILL CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS IN THE
MOUNTAINS. MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS AS WELL.
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH AND WITH THE WARM TEMPERATURES
THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT SNOW WILL MELT EXCEPT AT ELEVATIONS ABOVE
2500 FEET. EVEN AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS DEEPER MOISTURE WILL BE
DECREASING QUICKLY TUESDAY SO ONLY A DUSTING TO AROUND AN INCH OF
SNOW WILL ACCUMULATE. THE WARM GROUND WILL MAKE A DIFFERENCE AT
HIGHER ELEVATIONS TOO. DRY AND COLD AIRMASS SETTLES OVER THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY WEDNESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES ONLY SLOWLY
MODERATING. A WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY BUT EXPECT
PRECIPITATION TO STAY TO THE NORTH AND SOUTH. THE UPPER LEVEL COLD
TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA DEEPENS FRIDAY INTO EARLY SATURDAY WITH
SHORT WAVES MOVING SOUTHEAST FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE ON THE EDGE OF
THIS FEATURE SO HAVE KEPT THE CHANCE OF RAIN OR SNOW IN.
TEMPERATURES WILL STAY SEASONABLY COOL. HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE
BACK IN SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY WITH SKIES CLEARING.

OH RVR VLY TNGT AND MON. HAVE BACKED OFF ON PCPN TIMING ONCE AGAIN
EXPECTING BEST CHANCES MON AFTN AND MON NGT. EXPECT FRONTAL PASSAGE 
MON NGT BUT GOOD CAA DOESNT REALLY KICK IN UNTIL TUE. RAIN WILL 
CHANGE TO OR BECOME MIXED WITH SNOW ON TUESDAY WITH SURFACE TEMPS 
TOO WARM FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION. A NORTHERLY SURGE OF COLD 
AIR WITH A GREAT LAKES SOURCE REGION KEEPS THE CHANCE OF SNOW GOING 
TUESDAY NIGHT MAINLY ACROSS NE TN/SW VA. THIS MAY BE UNDERDONE IN 
MODEL PROGS AND CURRENT FORECAST BUT TOO EARLY TO TELL.  

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN 
BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  GFS INDICATING A 
WEAK FRONT PUSHING INTO THE REGION ON FRIDAY AND LINGERING INTO 
SATURDAY...MOISTURE LIMITED BUT WILL ADD SLIGHT POPS FOR FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY.  COLD AIR PUSHES IN ON FRIDAY NIGHT...WILL MENTION SNOW 
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.  NOT MUCH MOISTURE AVAILABLE...SO  
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE MINOR AND LIMITED TO THE UPSLOPE AREAS. 
ANOTHER FRONT PUSHING INTO REGION ON SUNDAY...BEST MOISTURE HEADS 
SOUTH OF OUR AREA...WILL KEEP SUNDAY DRY FOR NOW.  STAYED NEAR 
MEX/HPC FOR TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...MINOR UPDATE TO REDUCE CLOUDS AND POPS FOR TODAY. ALSO
NUDGED MAXS TEMPS UPWARD MAINLY SOUTHERN AREAS. RECORD HIGH TODAY
FOR TRI IS 67 AND MAY BE TIED OR BROKEN. SON

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STILL WAITING FOR RAIN OF ANY 
SORT TO ACTUALLY REACH OUR FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH PATTERN 
ALMOST THE SAME OVER PAST FEW DAYS WITH RAIN WELL TO OUR WEST AND 
NORTH. LOWER CLOUD DECK AND VERY LIGHT S TO SW SURFACE WINDS KEEPING 
TEMPS THIS MORNING VERY MILD...ACTUALLY RUNNING NEAR OR ABOVE 
TYPICAL HIGHS FOR MID JANUARY

CONTINUED HIGHER POPS FOR NE PLATEAU AND SW VA TODAY AND TONIGHT...
BUT STILL BELOW LIKELY EXCEPT FOR SLIM AREA NEAR JKL TO MESH WITH 
MUCH OF SE KY (WHERE SOME LIGHT RAIN MAY OCCUR). ELSEWHERE...PREFER 
TO STAY AT OR BELOW A BLEND OF MOS POPS FOR MY AREA...WITH CHANCE 
NORTH TO SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH TODAY. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAY DRAW 
CLOSE ENOUGH BY DAYBREAK MONDAY TO WARRANT AN INCREASE IN POPS...
ALTHO THREAT OF MEASURABLE RAIN FOR MOST OF AREA IS STILL UNCERTAIN.
THUS...KEPT POPS MAINLY IN CHANCE CATEGORY. EXPECT LIGHT RAIN 
INSTEAD OF SHOWERS UNTIL MONDAY DAYTIME WHEN COLD FRONT MOVES EAST 
INTO THE REGION.

WARM TEMPS AT 850 MBS AND POSSIBLE BREAKS OR THINNING OF HIGH CLOUDS 
TODAY...THUS WONT GET BRAVE AND UNDERCUT MOS HIGHS FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON. MOS MAX AND MIN TEMPS QUITE CLOSE AND ACCEPTED.

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH 
UPPER TROUGH IN SOUTHERN ROCKIES FINALLY PUSHES COLD FRONT THROUGH 
FORECAST AREA MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. RAISED POPS TO CATEGORICAL 
FOR MONDAY AND MOST AREAS MONDAY NIGHT. COLDEST AIR DOES NOT REACH 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL TUESDAY AND CURRENT MODELS ARE 
WARMER THAN PREVIOUS. ONLY EXPECTING A LIGHT DUSTING OF SNOW IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND NE TN TUESDAY. THERE MAY BE A FEW 
SNOW SHOWERS AREA WIDE TUESDAY EVENING BUT THE MOISTURE WILL BE 
RAPIDLY EXITING AND DO NOT SEE MORE THAN TRACE AMOUNTS. TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER MONDAY THAN TODAY MAINLY DUE TO 
RAINFALL. LATEST GFS MODEL KEEPS SUBTROPICAL MOISTURE ACROSS SOUTH 
TEXAS WEDNESDAY AS UPPER LEVEL LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES AND ANOTHER ONE BEHIND IT DEEPENS THE TROUGH AND BRINGS A 
SURGE OF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF TO THE NORTHEAST OVER THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY. THINK THIS IS A LITTLE FAST GIVEN THE SIZE AND STRENGTH OF 
THE COLD HIGH THAT WILL MOVE IN AT MID WEEK. WARMED TEMPERATURES A 
FEW DEGREES FOR THE THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY PERIOD AND INCREASED 
SKY COVER BUT KEPT IT DRY FOR NOW.

.DISCUSSION...MINOR UPDATE TO FORECAST. SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL EXIT 
AREA TO THE NE THIS AFTERNOON. REDUCED PCPN CHC AND CLOUD COVER 
SLIGHTLY FOR THIS AFTERNOON. ALSO NUDGED MAXS TEMPS UPWARD. SON

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PATTERN HAS CHANGED VERY LITTLE IF 
ANY OVER PAST 24 HOURS...WITH RIDGING STILL QUITE STRONG ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST STATES. BEST WARM AIR ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT 
REMAINS WELL TO OUR WEST AND NORTHWEST THIS MORNING...AS WELL AS 
LATER TODAY AND GENERALLY TONIGHT ALSO. SURFACE DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE 
RISEN SLIGHTLY...BUT 07Z VALUES WERE STILL RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES 
BELOW ANY OF THE LATEST MOS GUIDANCE VALUES. VERY LIGHT WINDS THE 
RULE AND 07Z SURFACE TEMPS WERE RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW GRID 
VALUES AND MOS AT MOST LOCATIONS. THESE ADJUSTMENTS WERE MADE TO 
GRIDS WITH DEW POINT TEMPS LOWERED BY A FEW DEGREES IN GRIDS FOR 
TODAY.

GIVEN THE LACK OF FORCING AND INSTABILITY...ONCE AGAIN THE POPS WERE 
TRIMMED BACK FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. GAVE A TIGHTER GRADIENT FROM 
NORTH TO SOUTH...WITH HIGHEST VALUES FOR OUR NE PLATEAU AND SW VA 
COUNTIES TO MESH WITH HIGHER POPS FROM JKL (NWS JACKSON KY). THINK 
THAT ANY RAIN AMOUNTS WILL BE VERY LIGHT...THUS QPF GRID AMOUNTS 
WERE LOWERED TO NOT MORE THAN A FEW HUNDREDTHS WHERE HIGHEST POPS 
WERE USED. DECIDED TO BE QUITE STINGY WITH LIKELY POPS FOR NOW...SO 
THE LIKELY POPS WERE LIMITED TO A NARROW AREA NEAR KY STATE LINE AND 
JUST FOR TONIGHT.

FOR MAX TEMPS TODAY...EXTENSIVE MID AND HIGH CLOUDINESS SHOULD 
INHIBIT REACHING THE MID 60S TODAY...SO OPTED TO UNDERCUT MOS 
GUIDANCE BY AN AVERAGE OF 2 OR 3 DEGREES. LIGHT SOUTH WINDS OR NEAR 
CALM WINDS AGAIN TONIGHT IN ANY AREAS THAT DECOUPLE...WHICH SHOULD 
FAVOR THE COOLER GFS MOS MIN TEMPS.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS STILL INDICATING RIDGING
HOLDING STRONG ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES SUNDAY WITH MOST OF THE
SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING NORTHEAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS NORTHEAST
ACROSS THE LOWER TN VALLEY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. WILL KEEP SLIGHT
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS AND LOW QPF AMOUNTS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.
EXTENSIVE CLOUDINESS AND SOUTHWEST FLOW AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT
KEEPS MILD TEMPERATURES AROUND THROUGH MONDAY. STILL LOOKS LIKE
MONDAY THE FRONT WILL START MOVING TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA AND
PASS THROUGH DURING THE AFTERNOON. TOTAL QPF AMOUNTS FOR THE NEXT
THREE DAYS MAY ONLY BE ABOUT ONE HALF TO ONE INCH SOUTH AND EAST
AND ONE TO ONE AND ONE HALF INCHES NORTHWEST. COLDER AIR FILTERS IN
BEHIND COLD FRONT LATE MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT BUT EXPECT
TEMPERATURES TO REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING UNTIL TUESDAY MORNING. BEST
CHANCE OF SNOW WILL BE TUESDAY MORNING AND WITH WARM GROUND
TEMPERATURES DO NOT THINK SNOW WILL STICK EXCEPT AT HIGHER
ELEVATIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS. MOISTURE MOVES OUT QUICKLY LATE
TUESDAY AS ARCTIC AIRMASS MOVES IN. SKIES WILL CLEAR WEDNESDAY AND

.DISCUSSION...MRX CWA ON NW EDGE OF SURFACE RIDGE. LOW LEVEL AIRMASS
BEGINNING TO MOISTEN UP. SMALL JET SEGMENT MOVING ENE ACROSS MID TN 
TO SW VA THIS AFTN. THIS IS BEST FOCUS FOR LIFT AND PCPN IN THE NEAR 
TERM. WILL MAKE MINOR ADJUSTMENT TO GRIDS TO DROP SLIGHT CHC PCPN
FOE SE AREAS THROUGH TONIGHT EXPECTING SPRINKLES AT BEST. ALSO TWEAKED
TONIGHTS MINS UP A DEGREE OR TWO. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER AIR PLOTS FROM 12/00Z SHOW 
A LARGE AREA OF WARM AIR ADVECTION RESULTING IN ISENTROPIC LIFT FROM 
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER EAST INTO WESTERN PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS DEPICT WEAK RETURNS OVER WEST HALF OF TN AND MUCH OF KY 
THIS MORNING...BUT PER SURFACE OBSERVATIONS NOT MUCH PRECIPITATION 
REACHING THE SURFACE. ANOTHER FACTOR LIMITING THE THREAT OF SOME 
MEASURABLE RAINFALL IS THE VERY LOW DEW POINT TEMPERATURES ACROSS E 
TN...SW VA AND SW NC (CURRENTLY HOLDING IN THE 20S AND 30S). LOWERED 
DEW POINT TEMPS TO START TODAY BELOW PREVIOUS GRIDS AND 12/00Z MOS 
...TO BETTER MESH WITH REALITY. KEPT MORNING POPS AT JUST SLIGHT 
CHANCE AND LIMITED TO NE PLATEAU AND WESTERN MOST PARTS OF SW VA. 
AFTERNOON POPS KEPT ONLY AS LOW CHANCE NORTH TO SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH 
GIVEN ONLY WEAK FORCING AND LACK OF INSTABILITY.

POPS WERE ALSO LOWERED FOR TONIGHT DUE TO SAME REASONING...AND IN 
LINE WITH LATEST MOS AND UPDATED POP/WX GRIDS FROM NEIGHBORING

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER AIR PLOTS FROM 12/00Z SHOW 
A LARGE AREA OF WARM AIR ADVECTION RESULTING IN ISENTROPIC LIFT FROM
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER EAST INTO WESTERN PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA.
AREA RADARS DEPICT WEAK RETURNS OVER WEST HALF OF TN AND MUCH OF KY 
THIS MORNING...BUT PER SURFACE OBSERVATIONS NOT MUCH PRECIPITATION 
REACHING THE SURFACE. ANOTHER FACTOR LIMITING THE THREAT OF SOME 
MEASURABLE RAINFALL IS THE VERY LOW DEW POINT TEMPERATURES ACROSS E 
TN...SW VA AND SW NC (CURRENTLY HOLDING IN THE 20S AND 30S). LOWERED 
DEW POINT TEMPS TO START TODAY BELOW PREVIOUS GRIDS AND 12/00Z MOS
...TO BETTER MESH WITH REALITY. KEPT MORNING POPS AT JUST SLIGHT 
CHANCE AND LIMITED TO NE PLATEAU AND WESTERN MOST PARTS OF SW VA.
AFTERNOON POPS KEPT ONLY AS LOW CHANCE NORTH TO SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH
GIVEN ONLY WEAK FORCING AND LACK OF INSTABILITY.

POPS WERE ALSO LOWERED FOR TONIGHT DUE TO SAME REASONING...AND IN

AS TEMPS FALL QUICKLY BELOW FREEZING. WILL ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER 
STATEMENT TO MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND LOOK REASONABLE. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH ZONAL FLOW RETURNING THURSDAY WITH A DRY AIRMASS IN
PLACE. COLDEST NIGHT WILL BE WEDNESDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE VALLEYS
WITH A LITTLE WARMING POSSIBLE ON THE PLATEAU WITH SOUTH WINDS
BEGINNING. TROUGH ON THE WEST COAST IS IN PLACE THURSDAY WITH LEE
SIDE LOW EAST OF THE ROCKIES FORMING AND MOISTURE BEGINS TO MOVE INTO
THE CENTRAL STATES. A SOUTHERLY TO SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL DEVELOP AND
WARM TEMPERATURES CONSIDERABLY ABOVE WEDNESDAY. STRONG HIGH
PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHEAST SHOULD KEEP SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY. IT
LOOKS LIKE RAIN WILL SPREAD INTO THE OHIO VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT AND
FRIDAY BUT UPPER LEVEL RIDGING AND THE SURFACE HIGH ALONG THE MID
ATLANTIC SEABOARD WILL STAY PUT AND KEEP THE DEEPER MOISTURE OUT
UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT. GULF MOISTURE SPREADS NORTH INTO MS VALLEY
FRIDAY AND WORKS ITS WAY EAST INTO THE EAST TENNESSEE VALLEY FRIDAY
NIGHT. UPPER LEVEL LOW AND TROUGH HANGS BACK OVER THE ROCKIES
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WITH FORECAST AREA ON FRINGE OF RAIN AREA AS
COLD FRONT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY STAYS FAR TO THE NORTHWEST. BEST
CHANCE OF RAIN AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE JUST AHEAD OF THE
FRONT SUNDAY WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S AND SOME GOOD WINDS ALOFT
AND SOME UPPER LEVEL INSTABILITY. ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE THUNDER
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. COLDER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND THIS

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A FAST-MOVING COLD FRONT ALONG THE 
PLATEAU WITH SNOW SQUALLS OCCURRING AHEAD IT ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. THESE SNOW SQUALLS HAVE ALREADY PRODUCED SOME ACCUMULATIONS UP 
TO AN INCH ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND GENERALLY LESS THAN 
AN INCH ACROSS CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS. THIS BAND OF SNOW WILL 
QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH SCATTERED 
ACTIVITY EXPECTED BEHIND THE FRONT FOR THIS AFTERNOON. IN 
ADDITION...UPSLOPE FLOW IN THE MOUNTAINS ALONG WITH STEEP LAPSE 
RATES WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS IN THESE 
AREAS. MODELS STILL INDICATE THAT TEMPS IN THE VALLEYS WILL RISE 
SOME THIS AFTERNOON...SO A MIXTURE OF SNOW AND RAIN SHOWERS APPEARS 
POSSIBLE SOUTH OF A CROSSVILLE TO KNOXVILLE LINE. 

OVERALL...THE CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. WILL PLAN TO 
CONTINUE THE SNOW ADVISORIES...BUT MENTION ONE TO FIVE INCHES IN THE 
MOUNTAINS WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS. 
OTHERWISE...WILL TWEAK THE FORECAST A LITTLE IN REGARDS TO TEMPS AND 
WINDS TO REFLECT CURRENT TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS EXTENDING 
NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM LOCATED 
OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS FAST-MOVING CLIPPER SYSTEM IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE SOUTHEAST TONIGHT INTO THE OH AND TN RIVER VALLEYS 
BY SUNRISE. GFS AND NAM MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
PROGRESSION OF THIS SYSTEM...AND BOTH HAVE INCREASED THE AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE EXPECTED WITH IT. BOTH MODELS ALSO REVEAL SOME NEGATIVE 
EQUIVALENT POTENTIAL VORTICITY VALUES OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH 
WOULD INDICATE THAT THERE COULD BE SOME CONVECTIVE PRECIP WITH THIS 
EVENT. STEEP LAPSE RATES ON THE MODEL SOUNDINGS WOULD FURTHER 
SUPPORT THIS POSSIBILITY. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT SHOULD MOVE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY NOON...WITH THE SYNOPTIC/CONVECTIVE 
EVENT TRANSITIONING TO MAINLY AN UPSLOPE EVENT BY THE AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING WITH STRONG NORTHWEST WINDS EXPECTED. WARM GROUND AND NEAR- 
SURFACE TEMPS IN THE VALLEYS SHOULD LIMIT ANY POSSIBLE SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS...ALTHOUGH UP TO AN INCH COULD QUICKLY ACCUMULATE IN A 
FEW AREAS WITH ANY POSSIBLE SNOW SQUALLS. 

OVERALL...THINK THAT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD MAINLY OCCUR IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE COLDER TEMPS AND UPSLOPE FLOW WILL BE MORE 
CONDUCIVE TO ACCUMULATIONS. BECAUSE OF THE POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE 
ELEMENT OF THIS EVENT...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WATCH FOR THE MOUNTAINS 
WHERE ONE TO SIX INCHES COULD ACCUMULATE...MAINLY ABOVE 2500 FEET 
(AND EVEN LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS). WILL ISSUE 
AN ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWEST VA WHERE AMOUNTS SHOULD GENERALLY BE 
AROUND ONE TO FOUR INCHES. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL UNDERCUT MOS GUIDANCE 
SOME FOR TOMORROW...BUT EVEN THEN...TEMPS SHOULD REMAIN WARM IN THE 
VALLEYS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...COLD UPPER TROUGH ACROSS 
THE EASTERN US DEPARTS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING AND COLD AIR ADVECTION 
WILL END DURING THE DAY AS FLOW BECOMES MORE WESTERLY. TEMPERATURES 
MAY STRUGGLE TO GO MUCH ABOVE FREEZING IN SW VA AND THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF EAST TN WITH ANY SNOW COVER. AIR MASS IS DRY AND SO
THERE SHOULD BE FULL SUN. WEDNESDAY NIGHT LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW SHOULD
DEVELOP OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU SO EXPECT LOWS TO BE A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER THERE...OTHERWISE ANOTHER COLD NIGHT IN THE VALLEYS. 
RIDGING AHEAD OF NEXT SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER THE ROCKIES MOVES 
THROUGH TN VALLEY THURSDAY AND THIS WILL WARM TEMPERATURES ABOVE 
NORMAL ONCE AGAIN. EXPECT SOME HIGH CLOUDINESS THURSDAY BUT DEEPER 
MOISTURE WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL FRIDAY. FRIDAY IS THE TRANSITION DAY 
AND LOOKS LIKE THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN WILL BE AFTERNOON AND MORE 
LIKELY EVENING WITH RAIN CENTERED ACROSS MS AND LOWER OHIO VALLEY 
UNTIL AROUND 06Z SATURDAY. THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO BE SLOW MOVING AND 
ANOTHER WARM ONE WITH RAIN ACROSS THE AREA. WILL HAVE TO WATCH 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS BECAUSE THE RAIN COULD LAST THROUGH MONDAY.

SHOWERS. TERRAIN AROUND 2500 FEET AND ABOVE IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND THE TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA MAY PICK UP 
AROUND AN INCH OF ACCUMULATION BEFORE ALL IS SAID AND DONE TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THE -SHSN SHOULD BE MIXED WITH -SHRA ACROSS LOWER ELEVATIONS 
IN THE FORECAST AREA AND DONT EXPECT ANY ACCUMULATION IN THESE 
AREAS DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE GROUND HAS A LITTLE TOO MUCH HEAT 
ENERGY FROM THE RECENT BEAUTIFUL MILD PERIOD. PRESSURE GRADIENT A 
LITTLE TIGHT ON TUESDAY AND THEREFORE A BIT ON THE BREEZY SIDE 
ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. FORECAST STAYS DRY WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL WEDNESDAY WITH WARM AIR 
ADVECTION GETTING UNDERWAY BY THURSDAY UPPER FLOW GOES SOUTHWESTERLY 
AGAIN. FRONTAL BOUNDARY DROPS SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY 
DURING THE WEEKEND AND WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE ADVECTION/ISENTROPIC 
LIFT AND A FEW WEAK SHORTWAVE PASSAGES MAINTAINED SLIGHT THROUGH LOW

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...
A BAND OF SHOWERS WITH A FEW EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE
ACROSS THE AREA THIS EVENING. THE STRONGER STORMS MAY HAVE THE
POTENTIAL TO MIX STRONG WINDS ALOFT DOWN TO THE SURFACE...AND THESE
WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED FOR POSSIBLE WARNINGS. THE HEAVIEST
PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO BE OUT OF THE AREA BY 06Z...WITH ONLY SOME
LINGERING LIGHT SHOWERS AFTER THAT. THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS SWINGS
THROUGH BETWEEN 12-15Z...AND WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTHEAST ON
MONDAY MORNING UNTIL IT CLEARS THE AREA. 

DRY AND COOL AIR WILL BUILD IN ON MONDAY AHEAD OF A CLIPPER THAT
WILL AFFECT US ON TUESDAY. THE MODELS HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES WITH
THE SYSTEM...THE GFS BEING STRONGER WITH THE POLAR JET ON THE WEST
SIDE OF THE TROUGH AND THUS IT BRINGS COLD AIR ALOFT FARTHER SOUTH
THAN THE NAM. THE GFS SHOWS AN OMEGA BULLS-EYE OVER THE AREA 12Z
TUESDAY WHICH IS LIKELY OVERDONE. WILL GO WITH THE PRECIP COVERAGE
SHOWN IN THE GFS BUT LOWER THE AMOUNTS. THE SHOWERS WILL BE DRIVEN
MAINLY BY INSTABILITY CREATED BY VERY COLD MIDLEVEL TEMPS AROUND
-30 C...WHICH PRODUCES 925-850 MB LAPSE RATES NEAR 9 C/KM IN SW VA.
WILL RAISE POPS TO HIGH CHANCES IN SW VA TO A SLIGHT CHANCE IN THE
CENTRAL VALLEY AREA. SOME ACCUMULATION WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND NE TN AS THERE COULD BE SOME QUICK
BURSTS OF MODERATE SNOW...BUT ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE HARD TO COME BY
ELSEWHERE DUE TO THE WARMTH OF THE GROUND. DRYING AND WARMING ALOFT
WILL LIKELY END ANY SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT TUESDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY..AND SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL SHIFT FROM THE MS RIVER VALLEY TO OFF THE ATLANTIC
COAST. THIS WILL BRING A RETURN OF WARMER TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE
END OF THE WEEK. DEEP MOISTURE SPREADS ACROSS THE MS VALLEY REGION
ON THURSDAY NIGHT AS AN UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES...BUT REMAINS TO
OUR WEST THROUGH FRIDAY. THE RIDGE BREAKS DOWN ON FRIDAY
NIGHT...GIVING A SLIGHT CHANCE POP. THE 00Z AND 06Z GFS KEPT THE
PRECIP TO OUR WEST...BUT THE 12Z RUN SHOWS A MORE PROGRESSIVE
PATTERN AND BRINGS A COLD FRONT THROUGH ON SUNDAY. WILL HAVE CHANCE
POPS IN SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY BUT WILL NOT JUMP ON THE STRONG
PUSH OF COLD AIR IN THE 12Z RUN JUST YET.

400 AM EST SUN JAN 7 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE QUITE WET 
TODAY INTO TONIGHT...AS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS INTO THE 
AREA...THEN OFF TO THE NORTHEAST TONIGHT. GOOD FEED OF MOISTURE FROM 
THE GULF WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND SHOULD BE A PERIOD OF FAIRLY STRONG 
FORCING.  INSTABILITY NOT IMPRESSIVE...BUT MAY BE ENOUGH WITH THE 
STRONG DYNAMICS FOR A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER.  EXPECT SOME HEAVY 
RAIN THIS AFTERNOON...BUT THINK SPEED OF SYSTEM WILL LIMIT AMOUNTS 
SOMEWHAT.  A LOOK AT FFG SHOWS MOST 3 AND 6 HOUR VALUES IN THE 1.5 
TO 2.5 INCH RANGE...SO WHILE SOME ISOLATED WATER PROBLEMS MAY 
OCCUR...DO NOT THINK IT WARRANTS A FLOOD WATCH AT THIS TIME...BUT 
WILL MENTION IN HWO. HOWEVER...THIS CERTAINLY BEARS WATCHING.  LOOKS 
LIKE WINDS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF E TN WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR A 
WIND ADVISORY THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY THIS EVENING...SO WILL ISSUE 
WITH THIS PACKAGE.  PRECIP WILL TAPER OFF TONIGHT...AND MAY ACTUALLY 
SEE A FEW SNOW SHOWERS MIXING IN OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN LATE 
TONIGHT AS COLDER AIR PUSHES IN. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO ONLY SOME MINOR TWEAKS.   

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THERE MAY BE A FEW LINGERING
-SHRA/-SHSN FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MONDAY 
MORNING. HOWEVER PRECIP WRAPS UP BY MID DAY WITH A LULL IN THE 
ACTION UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT MONDAY NIGHT AS CLIPPER SYSTEM DROPS 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. STRONG CAA AND 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT LEADS TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF -SHSN IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS WELL AS MUCH OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. IN LOWER ELEVATIONS A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND 
SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD OCCUR IN WARMER TEMPERATURE PROFILE. THERE COULD 
BE SOME MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATION IN THE MOUNTAINS. KEPT THE CLIPPER 
EVENT GOING THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WITH PRECIP ENDING BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. FORECAST 
AREA ENJOYS A PERIOD OF RIDGING WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. MOISTURE 
ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY AS 
MORE AMPLIFIED UPPER TROF BUILDS EAST INTO THE PLAINS STATES AND 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW STRENGTHENS. USED SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POP FOR SATURDAY AS UNSETTLED WEATHER RETURNS 
FOR NEXT WEEKEND. STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO GFS GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
A SURFACE FRONT LOCATED OVER THE AREA HAS BROUGHT MOSTLY CLOUDY
SKIES THIS AFTERNOON. A TROUGH ACROSS THE OK PANHANDLE WILL MERGE
WITH ANOTHER TROUGH OVER THE ROCKIES TONIGHT. AS THESE DISTURBANCES
MERGE OVER THE PLAINS...SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS WILL BEGIN NEAR
LOUISIANA. THIS LOW WILL TRACK NORTHEAST AND CROSS OUR AREA ON
SUNDAY. MOISTURE ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM
WILL BRING PRECIP INTO OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES AROUND 12Z...AND
OVERSPREAD THE AREA AND INCREASE IN INTENSITY THROUGH THE DAY. WILL
MENTION HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE AFTERNOON WHEN UPPER DIVERGENCE AND
LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ARE MAXIMUZED. STORM TOTAL QPF COULD BE NEAR
2 INCHES...BUT THE RAPID SPEED OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD LIMIT AMOUNTS.
DRYING BEGINS QUICKLY AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND WILL END POPS BY 12Z
MONDAY.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
COLD ADVECTION WILL DROP HIGH TEMPERATURES BACK ON MONDAY TO THE
40S. SOME RESIDUAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MAY GIVE PARTLY TO MOSTLY
CLOUDY SKIES IN THE MORNING. ON MONDAY NIGHT AN UPPER JET AND
CHANNELED VORTICITY APPROACH THE AREA. THE DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH
WILL RESULT IN COLD TEMPS ALOFT AND STEEP LAPSE RATES AROUND 7
C/KM. MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED BUT AN UPSLOPE COMPONENT AND THE
INSTABILTY MAY PRODUCE SOME RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS IN THE NORTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON TUESDAY. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE LOW CHANCE TO
SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE.

A RIDGE OVER THE AREA WILL PROVIDE DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY
THROUGH FRIDAY WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND. THE 12Z GFS SHOWS A
STRONGER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST WHICH KEEPS PRECIP TO OUR
NORTHWEST THROUGH SATURDAY...WHEREAS THE 06Z GFS BROUGH PRECIP IN
ON FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY.

330 AM EST SAT JAN 6 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
THROUGH THE REGION TODAY.  LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL NOT BE MUCH FORCING 
WITH THIS FEATURE...AND MAINLY JUST LOW LEVEL MOISTURE.  EXPECT 
PLENTY OF CLOUDS TODAY...AND PERHAPS A FEW SPRINKLES OR VERY LIGHT 
SHOWERS.  WILL KEEP POPS BELOW 20 PERCENT...AND JUST MENTION 
SPRINKLES FOR NOW.  CLOUDS MAY BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT TONIGHT...BEFORE 
INCREASING AGAIN FROM SOUTHWEST AS NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES.  TREND 
HAS BEEN SLOWER WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THIS NEXT ROUND OF PRECIP...SO 
WILL JUST CARRY 20 POPS FOR SOUTH LATE TONIGHT.  GFS MOS TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE BOTH PERIODS.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEATHER PATTERN EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD WILL CONTINUE TO BE ACTIVE WITH ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROF AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW EXPECTED TO SHIFT NORTHEAST FROM THE WESTERN 
GULF OF MEXICO ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY BRINGING ANOTHER 
HEALTHY BIT OF RAIN. SYSTEM EXITS BY DAYBREAK MONDAY WHICH ALLOWS 
FOR A BRIEF BREAK IN THE ACTION MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT AS DRYING AND 
HIGHER PRESSURES KEEP PRECIP AWAY. NEXT SHORTWAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST 
OUT OF CANADA IN CLIPPER FASHION. THIS FEATURE HAS SUFFICIENT COLD 
AIR TO WORK WITH TO MIX SOME -SHSN IN WITH A BIT OF RAIN WHICH WILL 
MAINLY BE A CONCERN FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE BUT FOR NOW USED A BROADBRUSH TECHNIQUE FOR 
WHAT APPEARS TO BE AN INSIGNIFICANT EVENT. THE AREA FINALLY GETS 
ANOTHER EXTENDED BREAK FROM PRECIP WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH 
RIDGING DEVELOPING AND TEMPERATURES REBOUNDING BACK TO A FEW DEGREES 
ABOVE NORMAL FOR MID JANUARY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A WEAK COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED
OVER MIDDLE TN THIS AFTERNOON AND OUT AHEAD OF IT WAS A VERY MILD
AIRMASS WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S TO LOWER 70S AS FAR NORTH AS
SW VA. IS IT THE MIDDLE OF WINTER A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION WAS
OVER GA AND MOVING ACROSS WESTERN SC AND NC. SCATTERED SHOWERS WERE
MOVING INTO NE TN AT THE EXTREME NORTHERN EDGE OF THE CONVECTION.
TO THE SOUTH AND BEHIND THIS ACTIVITY ONLY A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS WERE
SEEN. HOURLY RAINFALL AMOUNTS TO THE EAST OF MRX ARE UP TO ONE HALF
INCH WITH THE SHOWERS OTHERWISE AROUND A TENTH OF AN INCH OR LESS.
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT OF MOVING PRECIPITATION OUT THIS
EVENING AS FRONT MOVES EAST AND DISSIPATES. SURFACE LOW OVER IN
WILL MOVE NE INTO SOUTHERN CANADA BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. UPPER
TROUGH WITH FRONT MOVES THROUGH TONIGHT AND AIR MASS BEGINS TO DRY
OUT. HOWEVER ANOTHER LOW IS EXPECTED TO FORM ALONG THE FRONT AND
APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE SATURDAY. UPPER FLOW FROM THE
SOUTHWEST AND SURFACE WINDS FROM THAT DIRECTION WILL KEEP IT MILD
TONIGHT. EXPECTING LOWS ONLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S. WITH PARTIAL
CLEARING ALREADY THIS AFTERNOON ADDED PATCHY FOG LATE TONIGHT AND
SATURDAY. FOLLOWED THE HIGHER MET GUIDANCE ON SATURDAY.
CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S ALTHOUGH A
FEW SPOTS MAY REACH 70 LIKE TODAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE ROCKIES TODAY TRACKS EAST AND INITIATES 
CYCLOGENESIS ALONG THE LOUISIANA COAST ON SATURDAY NIGHT. MOISTURE 
ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BRING LIGHT PRECIP INTO THE 
CHATTANOOGA AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. AS THE UPPER TROUGH 
APPROACHES...THE LOW LEVEL JET STRENGTHENS AND THE PRECIP WILL 
INCREASE IN INTENSITY AFTER 12Z SUNDAY. DIVERGENCE WITH THE UPPER 
JET WILL BE MAXIMIZED IN THE AFTERNOON...AND THE RAIN COULD BE HEAVY 
AT TIMES. STORM TOTAL RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD BE NEAR 2 INCHES IN OUR 
NC COUNTIES. WILL RAISE POPS TO 100% SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY 
EVENING. THE GFS KEEPS SOME LIGHT PRECIP IN THE NORTHEAST AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...BUT THIS APPEARS TO BE OVERDONE AS FORECAST SOUNDINGS 
SHOW RAPID DRYING ABOVE 800 MB BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z. WILL END ALL 
POPS BY 12Z. 

BEHIND THE TROUGH PASSAGE...A PUSH OF COLD AIR WILL DROP TEMPS BACK 
TO NEAR NORMAL FOR MONDAY. FOR TUESDAY THE GFS HAS TRENDED FARTHER 
SOUTH WITH THE JETSTREAM AND DEEPER WITH THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH. THERE 
IS ALSO SOME MOISTURE TEH EXTENDS UP TO 700 MB WITH THE TROUGH THAT 
CROSSES OUR NORTHERN ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. JET DYNAMICS 
AND COOLING ALOFT MAY BE ADEQUATE FOR SOME RAIN SHOWERS IN THE 
AFTERNOON...CHANGING TO SNOW SHOWERS AFTER SUNSET TUESDAY NIGHT. 
WILL KEEP POPS LOW AT THIS TIME...LOW CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE. COLD 
ADVECTION TUESDAY NIGHT WILL BRING A DECENT SHOT OF COLD AIR...WITH 
LOWS TUESDAY NIGHT IN THE LOWER/MID 20S AND HIGHS WEDNESDAY IN THE 
UPPER 30S TO MID 40S. THE FLOW ALOFT REMAINS PROGRESSIVE...AND A 
LARGE RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE EAST COAST WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS 
WILL KEEP THE AREA DRY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH GRADUALLY WARMING 
TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION ACROSS WESTERN GEORGIA THIS 
MORNING IS MOVING NORTHEAST TOWARDS THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF TN AND 
SW NC. SOME SHOWERS WERE MOVING INTO THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND VALLEY 
COUNTIES AT THIS TIME. CLOUD TOPS WERE WARMING ON THIS CONVECTION 
AND EXPECT IT TO CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY WEAKEN AS IT MOVES INTO MORE 
STABLE AIR OVER SE TN AND SW NC BUT A LITTLE ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
MAY PRODUCE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS. VERY LIGHT RAIN HAS MOVED ACROSS 
THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA ASSOCIATED WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT 
MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA. TEMPERATURES AND DEW POINTS AT 
THIS HOUR ARE A FEW DEGREES OFF AND WILL ADJUST HOURLY TRENDS. WEAK 
COLD FRONT ACROSS WEST TN THIS MORNING WILL MOVE INTO EAST TN THIS 
AFTERNOON AND SLOWLY DISSIPATE TONIGHT. STILL THINK THERE WILL BE 
SHOWER ACTIVITY ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA BUT AMOUNTS AND 
DURATION MAY NOT BE VERY LONG EXCEPT ACROSS THE SOUTH. CURRENT  
FORECAST OF CLOUDY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AND HIGHS IN THE MID TO

POPS.  WITH DEWPOINTS AND TEMPS UNSEASONABLY HIGH...LOOKS LIKE THERE 
MAY BE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY...SO WILL INSERT SLIGHT CHANCE OF 
THUNDER FOR TODAY. TONIGHT PRECIP SHOULD PULL OUT FAIRLY

GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY A FEW MINOR TWEAKS. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...FORECAST STARTS OUT DRY WITH 
SOME SUNSHINE TO BOOT. HOWEVER...IN ACTIVE PATTERN YET ANOTHER WAVE 
OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE NORTHEAST FROM THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO

DEPARTS AFTER 00Z...AND WINDS VEER TO NORTHWESTERLY...ADVECTING 
DRIER AIR AND ENDING PRECIP SUNDAY NIGHT. 

THE REST OF THE FORECAST REMAINS DRY. TEMPS MONDAY WILL DROP TO NEAR

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:  
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)... 
IN THE SHORT TERM...SATELLITE SHOWS BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE/CLOUDS
SPREADING NORTH ACROSS GEORGIA IN RESPONSE TO INCREASING SOUTHERLY
WINDS BEHIND EXITING SURFACE HIGH. MESO-NAM DEPICTS THE MOISTURE
FAIRLY WELL NEAR THE 925MB LEVEL. THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL
SPREAD MAINLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA PRODUCING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AT CHA AND PLATEAU
OVERNIGHT.

RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES WILL MOVE
EAST ALLOWING A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE TO MOVE EAST NORTHEAST 
FROM NORTHERN MEXICO TO ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES THURSDAY
AND FRIDAY. BOUNDARY LAYER JET WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS THURSDAY WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT SPREADING INTO THE REGION
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. END RESULT...LIGHT RAINFALL WILL SPREAD 
INTO THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

THICKNESS WILL REMAIN UNSEASONABLY WARM THROUGH THURSDAY WITH MILD
DAYS AND COOL NIGHTS.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT EXTENDING THROUGH A DEEPER LAYER WILL 
WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE AREA FROM THE SOUTHWEST THURSDAY EVENING. A 
LOW LEVEL JET NEAR 50 KTS WILL RESULT IN PEAK MOISTURE ADVECTION 
AROUND 06Z. WE WILL LIKELY SEE A LULL IN THE PRECIP AROUND 12Z AS 
THE ISENTROPIC LIFT AND THETA-E ADVECTION EXIT. 500 MB VORTICITY 
ADVECTION AND 300 MB DIFFLUENCE WILL BRING ADDITIONAL SHOWERS FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON...WITH FROPA COMING AROUND 00Z. THERE IS ALSO SOME SLIGHT 
MIDLEVEL COOLING...WHICH LOWERS THE LIFTED INDEX TO NEAR ZERO. THE 
NAM SHOWS A NEGATIVE SURFACE-BASED LI...WHILE THE GFS IS SLIGHTLY 
POSITIVE AND MORE ELEVATED. PREFER THE MORE STABLE GFS...AND WILL 
CARRY ONLY A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS IN THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL 
VALLEY IN THE AFTERNOON. POPS LOWER THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH NO 
PRECIP MENTIONED BY SATURDAY MORNING.

THE JET STREAM STAYS NEARLY STATIONARY FROM THE RED RIVER VALLEY 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND INTO NEW ENGLAND...SO THERE IS NOT MUCH 
COLD AIR TO PUSH INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY. HIGHS WILL BE 15-20 
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL...IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. AS THE UPPER TROUGH 
DEEPENS AND THE JET BEGINS TO MOVE EAST...ANOTHER LOW DEVELOPS OVER 
THE LOUISIANA COAST ON SUNDAY. THIS LOW TRACKS NORTHEAST AND UP THE 
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS ON SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY. THE GFS HAS TRENDED 
SLOWER WITH THIS SYSTEM...CLOSER TO THE ECMWF. PUSHED POPS BACK TO A

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID 
ATLANTIC STATES...WITH TEMPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ACTUALLY CLOSE 
TO NORMAL THIS MORNING. THIS WILL CHANGE AS SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS 
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THIS HIGH TODAY...BRINGING WARMER TEMPS AND 
HIGHER DEWPOINTS INTO THE REGION FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS. IN 
FACT...MIN TEMPS SHOULD BE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER EACH SUCCESSIVE 
NIGHT AS THE DEWPOINTS RISE. LATEST GFS AND NAM MODEL RUNS ARE IN 
BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE PROGRESSION AND TRACK OF THE NEXT LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER TEXAS TONIGHT. RAIN SHOULD BEGIN TO 
SPREAD NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY...AS 
ISENTROPIC LIFT STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. A STRONG UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE TN RIVER VALLEY LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLDER AIR 
ALOFT BRINGING LIS CLOSE TO ZERO. THUS...WILL MENTION OF A CHANCE 
FOR THUNDER LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING. THIS UPPER 
TROUGH IS PROGGED TO PUSH MOST OF THE RAIN OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA 
BY FRIDAY NIGHT. 

UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINS SOUTHWESTERLY INTO THE WEEKEND...WITH 
UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE. IN FACT...TEMPS 
SHOULD BE AROUND TWENTY DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL ON SATURDAY AHEAD OF A 
WEAK COLD FRONT. GFS MODEL INDICATES THAT AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN JET 
STREAM WILL QUICKLY BRING ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST BY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.

AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE 
FORECAST PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS AND EXTENDING EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL SOME LINGERING CLOUDS ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY THAT ARE TRAPPED AGAINST THE APPALACHIANS UNDER A MID-LEVEL 
INVERSION. THINK THAT THESE CLOUDS SHOULD BE SLOW TO ERODE THIS 
MORNING...SINCE VERTICAL MIXING WILL BE LIGHT. THUS...WILL MENTION 
DECREASING CLOUDINESS IN ALL ZONES FOR TODAY. UNSEASONABLY WARM 
CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL 
DAYS...AS ZONAL FLOW ALOFT KEEPS COLD ARCTIC AIR WELL NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES 
WITH THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM PROGGED TO DEVELOP ACROSS TEXAS ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FOR NOW...WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO 
MODEL SOLUTIONS BY BRINGING RAIN INTO THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST ON THURSDAY. GFS MODEL INDICATES SOME SLIGHTLY NEGATIVE 
LIS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY NIGHT WITH THE APPROACH 
OF AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW. THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION A CHANCE FOR 
TSTORMS ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY NIGHT. 

THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD EXIT THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY... 
WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REMAINING SOUTHWESTERLY. AS A RESULT... 
UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND WITH 
TEMPS AROUND TWENTY DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL BY SATURDAY. GFS MODEL 
INDICATES THAT AN ACTIVE SOUTHERN JET STREAM WILL BRING ANOTHER LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM INTO THE REGION BY SUNDAY.

AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
300 AM EST MON JAN 1 2007

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS...WITH 
DRIER AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR FILTERING INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
SATELLITE IMAGES REVEAL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH 
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS UPPER TROUGH 
WILL SWING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATER TODAY...BRINGING AN 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER WITH IT. GFS MODEL PROGS REVEAL SOME LIGHT 
PRECIP AMOUNTS WITH THIS UPPER TROUGH...BUT CURRENT RADARS OVER THE 
MID MS RIVER VALLEY ARE ABSENT OF ANY PRECIP. THUS...WILL PLAN TO 
JUST MENTION AREAS OF DRIZZLE FOR SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. 
OTHERWISE...DRY AND UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS SHOULD LINGER 
THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...TEMPERATURES WARMING LEADING 
INTO NEXT RAIN EVENT ON THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY...THEN A BRIEF COOLER 
PERIOD...THEN ANOTHER SYSTEM COMES THROUGH ON SUNDAY. GFS NUMBERS 
ARE MUCH WARMER WITH THIS MODEL RUN AND FELT THEY WERE CLOSE...BUT 
MAYBE A LITTLE OVERDONE. BASICALLY WENT WITH GFS NUMBERS BUT SCALED 
THEM BACK A FEW DEGREES.
