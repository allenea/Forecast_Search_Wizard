.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A WEAK 
WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE 
CAROLINAS. A WEAK COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY 
LOW IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...BUT NO PRECIP IS EXPECTED WITH THIS FRONT DUE TO A LACK OF 
MOISTURE AND WEAK UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS. THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD BRING 
A GENERAL DECREASE IN CLOUDS OVER THE REGION TODAY...ALTHOUGH SOME 
HIGH CLOUDS FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS MAY CONTINUE TO MOVE 
NORTHEASTWARD OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...AN ACTIVE EXTENDED FORECAST 
WITH THE GFS AND ECMWF SOLUTIONS BECOMING QUITE DIFFERENT THIS 
WEEKEND/EARLY NEXT WEEK. FIRST SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AS A FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE BUT STRONG JET PULLS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS. THE JET ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AND 
NORTHERN STREAM JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY PRODUCE STRONG PRESSURE 
FALLS OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THE AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL 
CIRCULATION AROUND THE JETS HELP PULL MOISTURE NORTHWARD FROM THE 
GULF WITH PRECIPITATION EXPANDING NORTHEAST INTO THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY BY EARLY THURSDAY MORNING.

FOR THURSDAY...STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE/FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING AND 
ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL PRODUCE WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION. AS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY PULLS EAST ACROSS THE REGION THURSDAY...COLD AIR WILL COLD 
ARCTIC AIR WILL SPILL INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. PRECIPITATION WILL CHANGE TO SNOW FROM WEST 
TO EAST AND HIGH ELEVATIONS FIRST. BY LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING...A GOOD
PART OF THE REGION WILL EXPERIENCE SNOW.

FOR THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY MORNING...OROGRAPHIC NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWS 
WILL BE PRODUCING FAIRLY DECENT SNOWFALLS OVER THE NORTHWEST FACING 
SLOPES. ALSO...STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION ALONG WITH SOME LOW-LEVEL 
INSTABILITY WILL PRODUCE SNOWS EVEN ACROSS THE VALLEY. WARNING 
CRITERIA IS POSSIBLE OVER THE FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND MOUNTAINS OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...SUCH AS HIGH KNOB. ADVISORY CRITERIA SNOWS ARE 
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE PLATEAU...CENTRAL VALLEY...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...
VALLEYS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND CHEROKEE/CLAY COUNTIES OF NORTH 
CAROLINA. WILL INCLUDE IN THE HWO.

FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST WITH RIDGING OVER 
THE AREA WITH VERY COLD TEMPERATURES.

FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...THE GFS AND ECMWF DIVERGE GREATLY. THE ECMWF 
SHOWS VERY STRONG CYCLOGENESIS DEVELOPING OVER THE MID-ATLANTIC 
STATES PRODUCING HEAVY SNOWS OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. GFS 
SHOWS A MUCH WEAKER SYSTEM. CONFIDENCE IS VERY LOW AND WILL TREND 
TOWARD THE GFS.

HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET...THINK THAT FREEZING DRIZZLE WILL 
BE POSSIBLE SINCE MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE TEMPS AROUND -5 CELSIUS 
IN THE PRECIP GENERATION REGION (WHICH COULD RESULT IN SUPERCOOLED 
WATER INSTEAD OF SNOW). FOR NOW...WILL MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF A

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...RAIN WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE
NORTH OF THE AREA AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM PROGRESSES UP THE EAST
COAST. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO CLEAR BEHIND THIS SYSTEM THROUGH THE
EVENING. A WEEK COLD FRONT WILL THEN MOVE DOWN THROUGH THE AREA
OVERNIGHT SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. EACH MODEL RUN INTRODUCES MORE DRY
AIR INTO THE ATMOSPHERE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT. HAVE LOWERED
POPS FOR THE AREA...WITH FREEZING DRIZZLE AND LIGHT SNOW AMOUNTS
POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS EARLY MONDAY MORNING. BEHIND THIS
FRONT...HIGH PRESSURE BEGINS TO MOVE INTO THE AREA FOR MONDAY
EVENING AND TUESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW
NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER FLOW FLATTENS
OUT FOR A BRIEF PERIOD TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY BUT NEXT
FEATURE AMPLIFIES INTO THE CENTRAL U.S. BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.
ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE OVER THE MID SOUTH WILL DRAG A COLD
FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. TRAILING MOISTURE
BEHIND THE DEPARTING PRESSURE SYSTEM MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF
SOME SNOW SHOWERS IN THE COLD AIR ADVECTION PATTERN THURSDAY NIGHT.
THE FORECAST STILL LOOKS NICE AND DRY IN THE FIRST HALF OF THE
WEEKEND. NEXT MOVES INTO POSITION ACROSS THE CENTRAL STATES
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. MOISTURE ADVANCING NORTH AHEAD OF THE
SYSTEM COLD FRONT SHOULD LEAD TO THE FORMATION OF RAIN SHOWERS
AGAIN ON SUNDAY WITH ANOTHER CHANCE FOR A COUPLE SNOW SHOWERS
FOLLOWING IN THE COLDER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT SUNDAY NIGHT. STAYED A
LITTLE BELOW 12Z MEX MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH THE LONG TERM
PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...RAIN SHIELD CONTINUES TO 
SLOWLY ADVANCE NE INTO SE TN AND SW NC THIS AFTERNOON...WITH LIGHT 
RAIN NOW FALLING AT CHATTANOOGA. TEMPS HAVE BEEN SHUNTED DOWNWARD 
DUE TO THE EVAPORATIVE COOLING AND THICKENING CLOUD COVER. THE AREA 
OF RAIN/SHOWERS SHOULD SPREAD INTO EVEN NE TN AND SW VA BEFORE 
29/00Z...SO KEPT POPS RELATIVELY UNCHANGED FROM NEAR 100 PERCENT. 
THINK THERE WILL BE TWO ENHANCED AREAS OF LIFT AND QPF...1) NRN 
PLATEAU COUNTIES AND 2) SW NC PLUS MTNS ALONG TN-NC LINE. ADDED 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS TO THOSE AREAS...WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW OCCURS IN 
THE 06Z TO 12Z PERIOD SUNDAY.  

THE RAIN WILL CLEARLY EXTEND WELL WESTWARD ACROSS OUR ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT AND JUST INTO SUNDAY MORNING...THEN EXPECT 
THE DRY SLOT TO WORK ACROSS SE TN AREAS AS THE LOW LIFTS NE OUT OF 
THE REGION BY NOON SUNDAY. PRECIPITATION SHOULD DIMINISH IN THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...THEN A CHANCE OF RAIN OR SNOW SHOWERS SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO AT LEAST MONDAY MORNING. THE NAM MODEL IS LIKELY TOO 
ROBUST WITH PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY...AND WAS AN OUTLIER COMPARED TO 
ANY OTHER MODEL SOLUTION. THUS...I TONED DOWN THE NAM MOS POPS TO 
MORE OF A BLEND WITH THE DRY GFS MODEL. CARRYING 30 TO 40 PERCENT 
POPS FOR FAVORED HIGH TERRAIN AREAS ON MONDAY MORNING...WITH SOME 
VERY LIGHT SNOW ACCUMS ALLOWED IN THOSE SECTIONS SUCH AS WISE COUNTY 
VA. MIDNIGHT SHIFT CAN LOOK OVER ANOTHER MODEL RUN AND SEE IF ANY 
OTHER MODEL TRENDS TOWARD THE WETTER NAM.

OTHERWISE...MOS MINS VERY CLOSE AND FOLLOWED FOR BOTH NIGHTS. THE
MOS MAX TEMPS LOOK TOO WARM EACH DAY...ESPECIALLY ON MONDAY...SO I
UNDERCUT THE COOLER MAXES. UPDATED THE FLOOD STATEMENT PRODUCT THAT
WAS ISSUED YESTERDAY...PLUS AN UPDATE TO THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER
PRODUCT.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE TAIL END OF 
TRAILING SHORT WAVE COULD BRING A COUPLE SNOW SHOWERS TO THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER FOR A BRIEF TIME MONDAY 
NIGHT BUT COLD HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR THE FIRST PART OF THE 
WORK WEEK SHUTTING DOWN ANY CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...MODELS COMING INTO A LITTLE BETTER AGREEMENT 
WITH THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH ON THURSDAY. THE SYSTEM'S 
SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS WELL SOUTH ACROSS THE GULF OF MEXICO AND SHIFTS 
NORTHEAST OFF THE SOUTHEAST ATLANTIC COAST BY FRIDAY MORNING. ENOUGH 
MOISTURE AND SUFFICIENTLY COLD AIR FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERIOD 
OF SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA...MAINLY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY 
MORNING BEFORE DRIER AIR SPILLS BACK INTO THE REGION. THE REMAINDER 
OF THE FORECAST PERIOD FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT 
COULD BE DRY AND SEASONABLY COLD.

325 AM EST SAT DEC 28 2013

.SHORT TERM...TODAY AND TONIGHT
AN UPPER LOW WAS SPINNING OVER SOUTHEAST TEXAS EARLY THIS MORNING.
MID AND HIGH CLOUDS WILL STREAM NORTHWARD ACROSS MS...AL AND TN
THROUGH THE DAY. THE SURFACE HIGH THAT BROUGHT A SPECTACULAR DAY TO
THE REGION YESTERDAY WILL TRANSLATE OFF THE COAST OF NC TODAY.
CLOUDS WILL THICKEN AND LOWER THROUGHOUT THE DAY. TEMPERATURES
TODAY SHOULD BE MILD UNDER THOSE CLOUDIER SKIES. 

FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A VERY DRY LAYER OF AIR BELOW 700 MB
THROUGH AT LEAST NOON FOR SOUTHERN AREAS. THE LOWER LEVELS DO
MOISTEN UP BY LATE AFTERNOON SO HAVE STARTED TO SHOW SLIGHT CHANCE
CATEGORY FOR RAIN STARTING BY NOON AND INCREASING TO CHANCE BY THE
AFTERNOON. THE RAIN THAT DOES FALL WILL BE LIGHT AT FIRST AND
BECOME LOCALLY HEAVY TONIGHT. THE FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE SUPPORTED BY
THE ISENTROPIC SURFACES. NOTED THE 06Z RUN OF THE NAM IS ABOUT 6
HOURS FASTER SATURATING THE 305K AND 300K SURFACES. NO DOUBT ALL
AREAS WILL RECEIVE MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION TONIGHT AND THERE MAY
BE SOME POCKETS OF HEAVIER RAINFALL WILL OCCUR. 

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY
A BROAD AREA OF MODERATE TO PERHAPS LOCALLY HEAVY SHOWERS WILL
CONTINUE TO QUICKLY MOVE NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE REGION SUNDAY
MORNING...BEFORE TAPERING OFF BY MIDDAY INTO THE AFTERNOON FROM
WEST TO EAST. THE LATEST RUN OF THE NAM IN PARTICULAR...ALONG THE
OTHER MODELS HAVE CONTINUED TO TREND FASTER...AND SHOW MOST
MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION CLEARING THE FORECAST AREA BY 21-00Z
SUNDAY OR SO. AS A RESULT...HAVE SCALED BY QPF AND POPS SLIGHTLY TO
INDICATE THIS TREND...WHICH ALSO WILL SIGNIFICANTLY DIMINISH ANY
LOCALIZED FLOODING POTENTIAL. BEHIND THE INITIAL TROUGH PASSAGE ON
SUNDAY...AN ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WILL
BEING THE REGION ANOTHER SHOT OF COLDER AIR AND THE POTENTIAL FOR
SOME NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE CUMBERLAND
MOUNTAINS...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS OF NORTHEAST
AND EAST TENNESSEE. THE NAM IS SHOWING SOME MORE WIDESPREAD LIGHT
QPF SIGNALS LINGERING ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA DURING THE DAY ON
MONDAY AS WELL...WHICH COULD ALLOW FOR A BRIEF RAIN/SNOW MIX TO BE
OBSERVED IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS AS WELL.
HOWEVER...THIS SNOWFALL IS NOT EXPECTED TO PRODUCE MUCH...IF ANY IN
THE WAY OF ACCUMULATION...OTHER THAN SOME MINOR AMOUNTS ALONG THE
PEAKS OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE PLATEAU.

A COOL/DRY AIR MASS WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER NEW YEARS EVE AND THE 
FIRST DAY OF THE NEW YEAR. THEREAFTER...MODELS SHOW A BROAD 
UPPER-TROUGH SWING THROUGH THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS THURSDAY 
INTO FRIDAY. HOWEVER...THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE CONTINUES TO 
BE IN QUESTION AS THE GFS DOES NOT SHOW ANY PRECIPITATION WITH THIS 
NEXT SYSTEM...WHILE THE ECMWF INDICATES SOME A BROAD AREA OF LIGHT 
SHOWERS MOVING IN THURSDAY NIGHT. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS 
NEXT SYSTEM AND THE MODEL FLUCTUATION...HAVE INCREASED CLOUD 
COVER...BUT HAVE KEPT POPS BELOW MENTIONABLE LEVELS FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...CIRRUS CLOUDS STILL WELL TO 
OUR SOUTH THIS AFTERNOON...FROM THE LOWER MS VALLEY EAST ACROSS THE 
GULF COAST STATES. SURFACE RIDGE HOLDS GENERALLY IN PLACE OVERNIGHT 
WITH A DRY AIRMASS...SO MIN TEMPS WILL ONLY BE AFFECTED BY HOW THICK 
THE CIRRUS CLOUDS GET OVERNIGHT. A BLEND OF THE SIMILAR MOS MINS 
LOOKED GOOD AND CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS/NWS NEIGHBORS.

CLOUDS INCREASE ON SATURDAY BUT NOT EXPECTING ANY RAIN BEFORE 29/00Z
EXCEPT ACROSS THE SRN TIER OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHERE POPS WERE 
KEPT IN THE 20 TO 30 PERCENT RANGE. MOS MAX TEMPS CLOSE AND 
REASONABLE...SINCE THE CLOUDS ONLY LOWER TO A MID DECK IN THE 
AFTERNOON. 

SHOWERS INCREASE QUICKLY SATURDAY NIGHT AND I NUDGED POPS UP TO 100 
PERCENT FOR ALL AREAS. THE LIFT IS ENHANCED BY A BRIEF PERIOD OF 
UPSLOPE FLOW INTO WRN NC...ESPECIALLY FROM 29/06Z TO 29/12Z. ADDED A 
MENTION OF HEAVY RAINS FOR SW NC COUNTIES AND OUR ADJACENT MTN 
COUNTIES ALONG NC-TN LINE. QPF UP TO 2 INCHES POSSIBLE IN THOSE 
AREAS WITH A RIVER STATEMENT AND AN UPDATE TO THE HWO PRODUCT 
EARLIER.

SHOWERS TAPER OFF FROM THE WEST SUNDAY MORNING...BUT A CONSENSUS OF 
MODEL SOLUTIONS DOES EXTEND THE RAIN SHIELD WELL WEST INTO THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AREA AT THE START OF THE DAY. BUMPED POPS UP TO 
LIKELY SUNDAY MORNING IN THE WEST AND STILL CATEGORICAL IN THE EAST. 
WESTERLY FLOW AS THE LOW PRESSURE EXITS TO THE EAST...AND COLD AIR 
ADVECTION IS NOT THAT STRONG. THUS...EASED MAX TEMPS UP A FEW 
DEGREES IN LINE WITH THE LATEST NAM/GFS MOS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...STAYED CLOSER TO THE 
ECMWF THROUGH THE FORECAST WHICH FEATURES SOME TRAILING SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY AND SUFFICIENT MOISTURE FOR A CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN 
TRANSITIONING TO LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS MUCH OF THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT. 
BY MONDAY MOST OF THIS PRECIPITATION WILL HAVE ENDED. HOWEVER...SOME 
SNOW SHOWERS MAY CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER. DRY AND COLD AIR STREAMS ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH 
TUESDAY. ANOTHER CLIPPER BUILDS ACROSS MAINLY THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH JUST 
ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME RAIN SHOWERS ON THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU TERRAIN DURING THE DAY WITH SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS 
POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT ACROSS HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND ACROSS THE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS OF FAR EAST TENNESSEE. 
THE WORK WEEK FINISHES OUT WITH MORE DRY AND COLD ADVECTION. WENT 
A LITTLE CLOSER TO...IF NOT A COUPLE DEGREES BELOW THE ECM TEMPS 
THROUGH THE PERIOD.

SATURDAY NIGHT A RELATIVELY STRONG SHORT WAVE DRIVES NORTHEAST

HIGH POPS FOR SHOWERS SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. COLDER 
AIR SPILLS INTO THE REGION ON THE BACK SIDE OF THIS SYSTEM WITH 
ANOTHER MODIFIED ARCTIC BOUNDARY DROPPING INTO THE DEEP SOUTH. THIS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...A QUIET REST OF THE AFTERNOON
AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE HAS MOVED OFF TO OUR EAST AND LIGHT
SOUTHERLY WINDS HAVE DEVELOPED. NOT QUITE AS COLD TONIGHT WITH LOWS
5 TO 8 DEGREES WARMER THAN LAST NIGHT...BUT STILL ROUGHLY 5 DEGREES
BELOW NORMAL AREA WIDE. A QUICK MOVING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH TO OUR
NORTH WILL PASS THROUGH LATE TONIGHT THROUGH EARLY TOMORROW
MORNING. DUE TO LIMITED MOISTURE...IMPACTS WILL BE MINIMAL OTHER
THAN A BRIEF PERIOD OF CLOUDS. CLOUDS WILL MAINLY BE FROM KNOXVILLE
NORTH AND GREATER IN COVERAGE UP TOWARDS NETN AND SWVA WHERE THESE
AREAS MAY SEE PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY CLOUDY CONDITIONS AS THE
TROUGH PASSES THROUGH. SKIES SHOULD QUICKLY BEGIN TO CLEAR AS THE
TROUGH MOVES FURTHER TO OUR EAST LATER TOMORROW MORNING WITH MOSTLY
SUNNY SKIES EXPECTED TOMORROW. TEMPERATURES WILL BE FEW DEGREES WARMER
TOMORROW FOR AREAS SOUTH OF KNOXVILLE. THE UPPER TROUGH WILL KEEP
TOMORROWS TEMPS SIMILAR TO TODAY'S FOR AREAS NORTH OF KNOXVILLE,
ESPECIALLY FOR SWVA AND EXTREME NETN. OVERALL...A RELATIVELY QUIET
SHORT TERM WITH PLEASANT CONDITIONS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT TROUGH WEDNESDAY)...STARTS OFF FAIR AND
MILD. BUT THE MODELS ARE CAREENING TOWARD A WET WEEKEND...ONCE
AGAIN. MOSTLY SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MIDDAY SUNDAY. 12Z RUN OF
ECMWF HAS COME TOWARD THE GFS SOLUTION. IN THE GRIDS I HAVE NOT
JUMPED FULLY ONTO THIS YET...GIVEN THE CHANGING SOLUTIONS OF LATE.
GOING MOSTLY WITH CHANCE POPS /30-50%/ BUT GIVEN THE INCREASING
AGREEMENT OF MODELS TOWARD THE WET SOLUTION /INCLUDING THE
CANADIAN/...EXPECT FUTURE FORECAST PACKAGES TO FACE GOING EVEN
HIGHER WITH THE POPS. THE 06Z DGEX RUN IS A DRY OUTLIER...HENCE MY
HESITATION TO JUMP IN WITH BOTH FEET. TEMPERATURES SHOULD MAKE THIS
MOSTLY A RAIN EVENT. FOLLOWING THE EVENT THIS WEEKEND...ANOTHER BIT
OF A CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL FOLLOW WITH A FROPA LATE SUNDAY NIGHT
INTO MONDAY. COLDER TEMPS MONDAY MORNING MAY ALLOW FOR SNOW
FLAKES...BUT THIS SYSTEM WILL BE SOMEWHAT MOISTURE STARVED WITH NO
NOTABLE ACCUMULATIONS.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND CHRISTMAS DAY/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH THAT HAS CONTROLLED THE WEATHER OVER THE
REGION FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAY HAS FINALLY LIFTED OFF TO THE
NORTHEAST BY THIS AFTERNOON. IN ITS WAKE...THE LOW STRATUS THAT WAS
ENTRENCHED OVER THE AREA THIS MORNING HAS DISSIPATED AND ANY
LINGERING LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN WILL SUBSIDE
BY THE EARLY EVENING. WITH CLEARING CONDITIONS ACROSS THE
VALLEYS...GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL TAKE PLACE AFTER SUNSET AS
TEMPERATURES WILL QUICKLY PLUMMET INTO THE TEENS AND 20S. IN
FACT...LOW TO MID TEENS WILL BE COMMON ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES
BY DAYBREAK CHRISTMAS MORNING...WITH UPPER TEENS TO LOWER 20S
EXPECTED OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS. WINDS WILL QUICKLY
SHIFT TO THE SOUTHWEST AS A RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS ON CHRISTMAS DAY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A WARM UP INTO
THE 40S BY THE AFTERNOON...ALONG WITH A SUNNY AND PLEASANT DAY.

.LONG TERM /CHRISTMAS NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
GRADUAL WARMING WILL TAKE PLACE AFTER LOW TEMPERATURES IN THE 20S
THURSDAY MORNING. WE WILL SEE ANOTHER FRONT MOVE THROUGH THE REGION
LATER ON THURSDAY WITH NO CHANGE TO TEMPERATURES HOWEVER WINDS WILL
SHIFT. IT WILL REMAIN PRECIPITATION FREE THROUGH SUNDAY. BY SUNDAY
NIGHT A COLD FRONT WILL MAKE ITS WAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE
FAST NORTHWEST FLOW MAY BE ABLE TO SQUEEZE OUT SOME LIGHT RAIN OR
SNOW SUNDAY NIGHT PARTICULARLY IN THE OROGRAPHIC FAVORED AREAS. A
STRONGER SHORTWAVE WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT WHICH MAY ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LIGHT SNOW. THE
MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED SO CONFIDENCE IS RATHER LOW.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
CANADIAN AIR CONTINUES TO FILTER INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS
AFTERNOON...RESULTING IN TEMPERATURES GRADUALLY LOWERING
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. AS OF MID-AFTERNOON...TEMPERATURES HAVE DROPPED
FROM THE LOW TO MID 50S AT DAYBREAK INTO THE UPPER 30S AND LOWER
40S. THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AS LOWS
TONIGHT WILL PLUMMET INTO THE UPPER TEENS/LOWER 20S LATER TONIGHT
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...AND THE MID TO UPPER 20S IN THE VALLEYS.
WHILE MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION HAS SHIFTED OFF TO THE EAST OF THE
FORECAST AREA...SOME LINGERING FREEZING DRIZZLE MAY BE POSSIBLE
ABOVE 3000 FT IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH SUNSET GIVEN THE
COLDER TEMPERATURES THERE. 

OTHERWISE...DRIER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE REGION
ALOFT...AND EVENTUALLY HELP TO ERODE SOME OF THE CLOUD COVER THAT
HAS REMAINED ENTRENCHED OVER THE REGION TODAY. STILL THINK THAT
BKN/OVC LOW CLOUDS WILL LINGER THROUGH MUCH OF THE EVENING...BUT
SHOULD BEGIN TO BREAK UP SOMEWHAT BY DAYBREAK...AS MORE
SIGNIFICANT CLEARING OCCURS LATER IN THE MORNING. TEMPERATURES
TOMORROW WILL BE MUCH COOLER AND STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OUT OF THE UPPER
20S TO LOWER 30S IN MOST AREA DESPITE THE MOSTLY/PARTLY SUNNY
CONDITIONS GIVEN THE BRISK NORTHERLY FLOW. THE PASSAGE OF THE
UPPER-TROUGH MAY BRING A FEW NORTHWEST FLOW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS TO
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE. HOWEVER...NO MEANINGFUL ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED AS
THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE SCATTERED AND LIGHT. 


.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. 
UNDER CLEAR SKIES THE LOW TEMPERATURES CHRISTMAS MORNING WILL BE IN 
THE TEENS AND LOWER 20S ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. IN GENERAL...THE 
AREA WILL REMAIN PRECIPITATION FREE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE 
WEEK. HIGH TEMPERATURES ON CHRISTMAS WILL ONLY REACH THE MID 30S 
NORTH TO LOWER 40S SOUTH. A GRADUAL AND SLOW WARM UP EACH DAY WILL 
OCCUR. BY FRIDAY A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL DIVE OUT OF THE MIDWEST BUT 
THE SURFACE HIGH OVER THE TEXAS/LOUISIANA GULF COAST WILL HINDER 
MOISTURE. ADDITIONALLY THE UPPER TROUGH MAY ACTUALLY BE FARTHER 
NORTH THAN THE POSITIONING OF THE 12Z GFS. THEREFORE LITTLE TO NO 
MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION WILL OCCUR WITH THIS SYSTEM. THE NEXT 
ARCTIC FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA SUNDAY. TIMING OF THIS 
COLDER AIR WILL SIGNIFICANTLY ALTER TEMPS FROM CURRENT FORECAST BUT 
WILL BE A GOOD TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY TO BEAT THE MODELS FOR THE NEXT 
SEVERAL FORECAST CYCLES. WILL KEEP AN EYE ON FUTURE RUNS TO ADJUST 
FORECAST AS NEEDED.

.DISCUSSION...
SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT EAST AND EXIT THE REGION
BY THE EARLY AFTERNOON AS DRY AIR MOVES IN ALOFT ON THE BACKSIDE OF
THIS STORM SYSTEM. IN ADDITION TO THE DRY AIR...SOME MUCH COOLER
CANADIAN AIR WILL CONTINUE TO INFILTRATE THE REGION FROM THE NORTH
AND WEST IN THE WAKE OF A SECONDARY COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING. AS A RESULT...TEMPERATURES WILL
ACTUALLY DROP THROUGHOUT THE DAY INTO THE 30S BY MIDDAY. ALSO...
SOME LIGHT FREEZING DRIZZLE MAY BE POSSIBLE ABOVE 3000 FT OR SO IN
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE SMOKIES AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS WELL
BY THE LATE MORNING. HOWEVER...ANY ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE MINOR
AND MOST AREAS IN THE VALLEY SHOULD ACTUALLY STAY DRY. THE OTHER
QUESTION FOR THE FORECAST WAS THE CLOUD COVER...WHICH APPEARS WILL
HANG ON FOR MOST OF THE DAY DESPITE SOME DRYING TAKING PLACE ALOFT.
HAS A RESULT...HAVE INCREASED THE WORDING IN THE GRIDS TO
PARTLY/MOSTLY CLOUDY FOR THE AFTERNOON...AS SOME DISSIPATION WILL
TAKE PLACE IN THE WESTERN ZONES BY THE LATE AFTERNOON...AND
EVENTUALLY THE EASTERN AREAS THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.

THE LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS WAS CURRENTLY MARCHING ACROSS MS AND TN. THE
LINE WAS MOVING AT ABOUT 70 MPH TO THE NNE WHICH MAY BRING IT INTO
THE NORTHEASTERN PLATEAU IN ABOUT 4 HOURS OR SO. THE SOUTHERN PART
OF THE LINE WILL LAG BEHIND BUT WILL BE WATCHING FOR ANY STORMS
THAT MAY DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE LINE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
EVENING. STRONGEST STORMS MAY OCCUR OVER THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WHERE
THE BEST INSTABILITY WILL OCCUR. DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN
THREAT AS THESE STORMS MOVE THROUGH. 

MADE MINOR CHANGES TO THE FORECAST GRIDS TO BETTER REFLECT CURRENT
UNUSUALLY WARM CONDITIONS AND HIGHER DEWPOINTS. IT APPEARS AS
THOUGH THE LINE WILL MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH AFTER SUNRISE SUNDAY AND
SHOULD BE OUT OF THE AREA BY MID-DAY WITH SOME LINGERING SHOWERS IN

UPPER JET WILL HELP TO ENHANCE LIFT.  LOW LEVEL SHEAR IS 
STRONG...AND APPEARS THERE WILL BE SOME LIMITED 
INSTABILITY...ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND WEST ZONES.  SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE IN LATE...AND SOME THUNDERSTORMS MAY BE 
SEVERE ESPECIALLY WEST AND SOUTH LATE TONIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY.  
DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE THE PRIMARY THREAT...BUT AN ISOLATED TORNADO 
CANNOT BE RULED OUT.  WILL CONTINUE MENTION IN HWO.  STRONG PRESSURE 
GRADIENT WILL LEAD TO STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS AHEAD OF THE FRONT 
TONIGHT INTO EARLY SUNDAY...WITH THE STRONGEST WINDS EXPECTED OVER 
THE HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS. WILL LEAVE WIND ADVISORIES AS THEY ARE 
FOR NOW.  THE FRONT WILL HANG UP OVER THE REGION...SO WHILE PRECIP 
WILL DIMINISH FROM WEST TO EAST DURING THE DAY SUNDAY...WILL LINGER 
LIKELY POPS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON EAST ZONES.  WILL GO A BIT ABOVE 
MAV TEMPS FOR MOST LOWS TONIGHT...BUT LESS ARGUMENT WITH HIGHS 
SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)... THE INITIAL PACIFIC
COLD FRONT WILL MOVE JUST EAST OF THE REGION BY THE EARLY
EVENING...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO TAPER OFF PRECIPITATION OVER THE
WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...A SUBTLE SHORTWAVE
ROTATING AROUND THE NORTHEASTWARD PROPAGATING LOW WILL HELP TO DRAW
ADDITIONAL GULF MOISTURE INTO THE AREA...AND KEEP A DECENT CHANCE
FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS... NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE
NIGHT. AFTER SUNRISE ON MONDAY...SOME CLEARING WILL BEGIN TO TAKE
PLACE AS THE BASE OF THE BROAD UPPER-TROUGH APPROACHES. THIS WILL
PUSH A COOLER/DRIER AIR MASS INTO THE AREA WHICH WILL BE IN PLACE
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR MUCH OF THE HOLIDAY WEEK AHEAD.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE MUCH COOLER ON MONDAY NIGHT AS LOWS BOTTOM OUT
IN THE TEENS AND 20S...AND HIGHS WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB MUCH ABOVE
THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S ON CHRISTMAS EVE DAY DESPITE THE AMPLE
SUNSHINE. SOME RIDGING WILL BEGIN TO TAKE PLACE BY CHRISTMAS
DAY...ALLOWING FOR A WARM UP OF AROUND 10-15 DEGREES AND AN OVERALL
BEAUTIFUL MOSTLY SUNNY DAY.

THE SECOND HALF OF THE WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY 
A SERIES OF WEAK DISTURBANCES MOVING THROUGH THE AREA...WHICH DO NOT 
APPEAR WILL HAVE MUCH OF AN IMPACT OTHER THAN PERHAPS A GRADUAL 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER. A WEAK FRONT IS PROGGED TO PASS THROUGH THE 
AREA THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY...BUT VERY LIMITED MOISTURE WILL LIKELY 
PREVENT ANYTHING MORE THAN A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS AT WORST. 
THUS...HAVE MAINTAINED THE DRY FORECAST THROUGH SATURDAY. ANOTHER 
BROAD UPPER-TROUGH MAY ARRIVE BY THE END OF THE WEEKEND WHICH COULD 
GIVE THE REGION ITS NEXT BEST SHOT AT ANY PRECIPITATION.

OVER ARKANSAS TODAY AND MOVE TO WESTERN NEW YORK LATE ON SUNDAY. 
STRONG LOW LEVEL JET WILL DEVELOP OVER THE TN AND OH VALLEYS TODAY
AND CONTINUE TONIGHT. SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL BECOME STRONG BY TONIGHT 
WITH FAVORABLE SET UP FOR DOWNSLOPING WINDS ACROSS THE FOOTHILLS OF

TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL FOR THE FIRST DAY OF WINTER. 1967 HIGH 
TEMPERATURES RECORDS WILL BE THREATENED...CHA 72...TYS 74...TRI 71. 
THE WARM TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT WITH THE COLD FRONT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL 
DEVELOP AND MOVE NORTHEAST ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WELL TO OUR 
WEST DURING THE SHORT TERM.  THE LOW LEVEL JET WILL 
INCREASE...BRINGING ADDITIONAL MOISTURE TO THE AREA.  FORCING WILL 
BE WEAK DURING THE SHORT TERM...SO ANY RAINFALL SHOULD BE LIGHT.  
APPEARS LOW LEVEL WIND DIRECTION WILL PROVIDE SOME DOWNSLOPING 
SATURDAY OVER PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY. WILL KEEP 
POPS THERE ON THE LOW SIDE...WITH LOW LIKELY POPS CONFINED TO THE 
SOUTH AND PLATEAU. IT WILL ALSO BE QUITE WARM SATURDAY WITH HIGHS IN 
MOST LOCATIONS WELL INTO THE 60S.  WINDS WILL BEGIN TO PICK UP AS 
WELL MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT WILL KEEP BELOW WIND 
ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR NOW.  WILL GENERALLY GO NEAR TO A BIT ABOVE 
MAV TEMPS FOR THE SHORT TERM...BLENDING IN SOME OF THE HIGHER MET 
NUMBERS.         

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... A STRONG UPPER-
LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL IMPACT THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT AND
SUNDAY...BRINGING SOME HIGH WINDS...STRONG THUNDERSTORMS AND
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL TO THE AREA. MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...AS THE HEAVIEST
PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE IN LATE SATURDAY NIGHT /9Z/ AND OVERSPREAD
THE AREA AFTER SUNRISE...BEFORE QUICKLY MOVING OUT OF THE AREA BY
MID TO LATE AFTERNOON /18-21Z ON SUNDAY/. AHEAD OF THE
PRECIPITATION...A STRONG 60-70 KT LOW-LEVEL WILL ROTATE OVER THE
AREA...AND HELP TO PRODUCE SOME STRONG ADVISORY-LEVEL WINDS
/PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN/. SOME OF THE GUSTS MAY
APPROACH THE HIGH-END ADVISORY/HIGH WIND CRITERIA. HOWEVER...THE
LACK OF A STABLE LAYER ALOFT WILL LIKELY HINDER THE MOUNTAIN WAVE
POTENTIAL DESPITE THE SLIGHTLY BACKED SSE FLOW OVER THE MOUNTAINS.
STILL...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME STRONG/GUSTY WINDS EXISTS AREAWIDE
AND WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS IN THE HWO.

IN ADDITION TO THE GRADIENT WINDS...THE STRONG WIND SHEAR COMBINED 
WITH SOME INSTABILITY WILL YIELD THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME ORGANIZED 
STRONG TO POSSIBLY ISOLATED SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS LATE SATURDAY NIGHT 
INTO SUNDAY MORNING /PARTICULARLY ALONG THE PLATEAU AND THE SOUTHERN 
AND CENTRAL VALLEY/...AS A DECAYING LINE OF HEAVY SHOWERS/STORMS 
WORKS IT WAY IN FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE. DO NOT THINK THE THREAT WILL 
BE TERRIBLY WIDESPREAD...BUT SOME DAMAGING CONVECTIVE WINDS GUSTS 
WILL CERTAINLY POSSIBLE DURING THIS TIMEFRAME. ALSO...WITH PWATS 
OVER 1.5 INCHES AND STRONG DIVERGENCE ALOFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET...SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND 
PERHAPS SOME MINOR FLOODING WILL BE POSSIBLE FROM THESE SHOWERS AND 
STORMS. 

IN WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM SUNDAY NIGHT...COOL/DRY AIR WILL QUICKLY 
FILTER INTO THE AREA...SHUTTING OFF PRECIPITATION QUICKLY. THE NAM 
WANTS TO BRING SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT SHOWERS/CLOUDS ALONG THE 
MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST ZONES ON MONDAY AS THE BASE OF THE TROUGH 
SWINGS THROUGH...BUT HAVE NOT GONE ABOVE LOW-END CHANCE POPS AS 
THINK THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE FAIRLY ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED FOR 
THE MOST PART. AS MENTIONED...SOME LOWER TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN 
PLACE FOR THE NEW WEEK...WITH HIGHS GENERALLY REACHING THE 40S TO 
AROUND 50 DEGREES IN THE VALLEYS. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT...WITH SOME 
RIDGING BY CHRISTMAS DAY WILL ALLOW FOR SUNNY AND PLEASANT 
CONDITIONS FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF THE HOLIDAY WEEK...BEFORE 
CLOUDS INCREASES AHEAD OF ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH TO CLOSE OUT THE 
WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...HIGH CLOUDS THINNED AROUND SUNSET WHICH HAS ALLOWED 
HOURLY TEMPS TO FALL BELOW FORECAST GRID VALUES AT MID EVENING. 
HOWEVER...IR SATELLITE PICS SHOW THE HIGH CLOUDS INCREASING NOW.
THUS...CURRENT TEMPS AND GRIDS MAY DRIFT CLOSER IN A FEW HOURS.

20/00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS INDICATED QUITE WARM 850 MB TEMPS PLUS MODEL 
FORECAST SOUNDINGS SUGGEST MID SLOPE TEMPS POSSIBLY STILL IN THE 40S 
TO LOWER 50S AT THIS POINT. MAY OPEN UP MORE OF A RANGE IN MIN TEMPS 
FOR THE MTN GROUPS...AND ALSO CHECK MIN TEMP FORECAST IN A FEW OTHER 
GROUPS. UPDATED GRIDS AND ANY AFFECTED PRODUCTS SHORTLY.

302 PM EST THU DEC 19 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...BROAD UPPER RIDGE OVER THE 
REGION WILL SHIFT EAST AS WILL THE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR EAST 
THAT EXTENDS INTO OUR AREA.  MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE...WITH 
INCREASING MAINLY HIGH CLOUDS TONIGHT AND SOME LOWER CLOUDS MOVING 
IN DURING FRIDAY.  MOISTURE SHOULD BE ON THE SHALLOW SIDE FOR FRIDAY 
AND FORCING WEAK...SO WILL ONLY CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN 
THE AFTERNOON FOR OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE 
FOR THE MOST PART SO NO MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... THE MAIN FORECAST
CONCERN FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE THE STRONG UPPER-LEVEL
STORM SYSTEM PROGGED IN IMPACT THE REGION THIS WEEKEND.
ATTM...THERE ARE STILL SOME SUBTLE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE MODELS
REGARDING A POTENTIAL BREAK IN THE PRECIP SATURDAY NIGHT AND A
POSSIBLE START TO THE HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION ON SUNDAY.
HOWEVER...BOTH THE GFS...NAM...ECMWF AND CMC ALL SHOW A BROAD AREA
OF LOCALLY HEAVY SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS APPROACHING THE AREA
LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AND OVER SPREADING THE AREA ON SUNDAY
MORNING...AND THEN EXITING THE AREA BY SUNDAY EVENING.

AS MENTIONED...THE POTENTIAL FOR THE HEAVIEST RAIN APPEARS TO BE 
BETWEEN 09Z TO 18Z ON SUNDAY. WITH A 60-70 KT LOW LEVEL JET ROTATING 
OVER THE AREA AND SOME INSTABILITY PRESENT...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME 
ORGANIZED STRONG THUNDERSTORMS IN ADDITION TO THE LOCALLY HEAVY 
SHOWERS THAT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA. ALSO...GIVEN THE DEEP WARM 
CLOUD LAYER AND PWAT VALUES OVER 1.5 INCHES...WIDESPREAD LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE A BIG CONCERN WITH THIS ACTIVITY AS WELL. 
ANOTHER BIG CONCERN WILL BE THE STRONG GRADIENT SOUTHERLY WINDS 
PROGGED TO BE OCCURRING AHEAD OF THIS STORM SYSTEM SATURDAY NIGHT 
AND SUNDAY MORNING. A WIND ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED FOR PORTIONS OF 
THE VALLEY...AND PERHAPS A HIGH WIND WATCH/WARNING FOR THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF THE SMOKIES. 

IN WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM SUNDAY NIGHT...DRY AIR WILL QUICKLY FILTER 
INTO THE AREA...SHUTTING OFF PRECIPITATION QUICKLY. SOME COOLER 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE IN PLACE FOR THE NEW WEEK...WITH HIGHS 
GENERALLY REACHING THE 40S TO AROUND 50 DEGREES IN THE VALLEYS. 
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT...WITH SOME RIDGING BY CHRISTMAS DAY WILL ALLOW FOR 
SUNNY AND PLEASANT CONDITIONS FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF THE 
HOLIDAY WEEK.

344 AM EST THU DEC 19 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...VERY QUIET ON FRONT END OF 
THIS FORECAST...WITH THICKENING OF CIRRUS CLOUDS TODAY ABOUT THE 
BIGGEST ISSUE.  HOWEVER...BIG PUSH OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BY 
FRIDAY...AND ENTIRE AREA WILL LIKELY BE SWALLOWED UP BY LOW CLOUDS 
DURING THE DAY.  WAS TEMPTED TO NOT HAVE ANY POPS FOR FRIDAY DUE TO 
HOW SHALLOW THE MOISTURE WILL BE AND WITHOUT ANY SIGNIFICANT 
INSTABILITY THIS FAR EAST...BUT LEFT IN LOW POPS IN WEST AND 
SOUTHWEST JUST IN CASE THEY GET SOME HEAVIER DRIZZLE IF IT GETS 
JUICY ENOUGH OR A LIGHT SHOWER WITH LIMITED INSTABILITY.

WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE ON TEMPERATURES...MAINLY TWEAKED PLATEAU MIN 
TEMP TONIGHT TO RAISE THEM DUE TO INCREASING WINDS AT THOSE ELEVATED 
LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THE GFS...ECMWF..AND CMC ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE GENERAL 
TIMING OF STRONGEST LIFT/DEEPEST MOISTURE FOR THE WEEKEND. THE NAM 
APPEARS TO BE AN OUTLIER...HOLDING BACK PRECIP MUCH SLOWER THAN THE 
OTHERS. WILL FOLLOW THE GFS/ECMWF/CMC...WHICH IS CLOSE TO THE 
PREVIOUS FORECAST...SO NO MAJOR CHANGES WILL BE MADE. 

THE WINDOW OF HEAVIEST PRECIP APPEARS TO BE 09Z SUNDAY TO 18Z 
SUNDAY. DURING THIS TIME...A 70 KT LLJ WILL BE OVER THE AREA...WITH 
850 MB THETA-E VALUES ABOVE 330K. THIS SHOULD GIVE AT LEAST A CHANCE 
OF THUNDERSTORMS...ANY OF WHICH COULD PRODUCE DAMAGING WIND 
GUSTS...LIKELY IN THE FORM OF A SQUALL LINE. STRONG DIVERGENCE ALOFT 
IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET ACTING ON PW VALUES OVER 1.5 
INCHES WILL MEAN WIDESPREAD MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. WIND 
ADVISORIES OR A HIGH WIND WATCH/WARNING MAY BE NEEDED IN HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS AS WE DRAW CLOSER TO THE EVENT. DRY ADVECTION FROM THE 
WEST WILL BRING AN END TO THE PRECIP BEFORE 12Z MONDAY...A BIT 
FASTER THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST. 

MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY LOOK DRY WITH TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO OR 
SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL.

HIGH CLOUDS WILL ALLOW LOWS TO WARM A FEW DEGREES FRIDAY MORNING. 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES FRIDAY WITH CONTINUED SOUTH WINDS. 
HIGHS FRIDAY SIMILAR TO THURSDAY IN THE UPPER 50S TO THE LOWER 60S.
RAIN CHANCES SLOWLY INCREASE FRIDAY BUT MODELS A LITTLE SLOWER SO 
LOWERED CHANCES TO MAINLY LATE IN THE DAY. DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE

DEEP SURFACE LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS/MS VALLEY WITH LONG PLUME 
OF MOISTURE TO THE NE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS 
DEVELOP OUT AHEAD OF COLD FRONT AND LOW WARMING TEMPERATURES INTO 
THE 60S SATURDAY. AIR MASS BECOMES UNSTABLE ENOUGH FOR THUNDERSTORMS 
AND SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS JUST AHEAD OF FRONT. COLD FRONT TO MOVE 
THROUGH DURING THE DAY SUNDAY. WRAP AROUND CLOUDS BEHIND FRONT AND 
LEFTOVER MOISTURE WILL KEEP A FEW SHOWERS IN THE FORECAST AREA INTO 
MONDAY MORNING. MUCH COOLER SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. HIGH 
PRESSURE REBUILDS OVER THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT. MOSTLY CLEAR AND 
COOL TO COLD TEMPERATURES FOR CHRISTMAS EVE AND DAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS BUILDING INTO THE REGION EARLY THIS
MORNING. THE SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER SW VA AND ALONG THE
TN/NC MOUNTAINS SHOULD BEGIN TO RELAX AS THE MORNING GOES ON...SO
EXPECT LESS WIND AS THE DAY PROGRESSES. MAX DAYTIME AND OVERNIGHT
LOW TEMPERATURES TODAY AND TONIGHT WILL BE SLIGHTLY BELOW SEASONAL
NORMALS.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A RIDGE OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST WILL PROVIDE A MILD SW FLOW TO THE 
AREA FOR THE REST OF THE WEEK...WITH TEMPERATURES RISING WELL ABOVE 
NORMAL. OUTSIDE OF SOME INCREASING HIGH CLOUDS THURSDAY NIGHT...THE 
COLUMN REMAINS QUITE DRY UNTIL FRIDAY. POSITIVE THETA-E ADVECTION 
AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BRING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS STARTING ON 
FRIDAY. 

MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN GENERALLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SYSTEM FOR 
THE WEEKEND. THE SW FLOW PATTERN REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT...AND THE STRONG LIFT STAYS TO OUR WEST THROUGH 
SATURDAY. WILL BEGIN TO SLOWLY EDGE POPS UPWARD IN THE PLATEAU ON 
SATURDAY...A BIT SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY FORECAST. THE PATTERN 
BECOMES MORE PROGRESSIVE ONCE THE SOUTHERN STREAM LOW MERGES WITH 
THE NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. WE WILL BEGIN TO SEE SOME 
STRONG LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH A DYNAMIC JET AND GOOD LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. 850 MB THETA-E VALUES AROUND 330K 
SUGGEST A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS IS WARRANTED THROUGH SUNDAY. A 
THREAT OF SOME SEVERE STORMS CANNOT BE RULED OUT EITHER AS THE LLJ 
IN THE GFS IS 60-70 KTS. 

SURFACE FROPA OCCURS SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT WITH THE POSITIVELY-TILTED 
UPPER TROUGH...THERE IS NOT A STRONG SURGE OF COLD AIR BEHIND IT. 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY SHOULD BE DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY AS DRY AIR AND 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILD IN...WITH TEMPS CLOSE TO NORMAL.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
340 PM EST TUE DEC 17 2013

.SHORT TERM...
DYNAMIC CLIPPER SYSTEM NOW CROSSING OHIO RIVER IS POISED TO ENHANCE
LIFT AND INSTABILITY OVER THE NORTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA IN THE
NEXT FEW HOURS. MOST OF THIS ACTION WILL OCCUR PRIOR TO 00Z...SO
ZONES WILL HAVE A PRE-FIRST PERIOD TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS SHORT EVENT.
LATEST MODEL READINGS LOOK SLIGHTLY WARMER...BUT STILL THINK PRECIP
WILL TURN TO SNOW SHOWERS BEFORE ENDING IN MOST OF NORTHEASTERN
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. FOR ELEVATIONS ABOVE ABOUT 3500 FEET
MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY BE SNOW...SO SOME LIGHT
ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED. IN THE ZONE FORECAST WILL PUT IN UP TO
1 INCH IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF WISE AND RUSSELL COUNTIES.

AHEAD OF THE FRONT TEMPERATURES LOOK TO BE RUNNING WARMER THAN
EXPECTED SO THAT WILL DELAY COOLING SOMEWHAT...AND THEREFORE THE
CHANGEOVER TO SNOW.

WINDS GUSTY THIS AFTERNOON...BUT MAINLY STAYING BELOW ADVISORY
LEVELS AND EXPECTED TO STAY BELOW CRITERIA FOR MOST LOCATIONS.

EVERYTHING SHOULD SETTLE DOWN FOR TOMORROW...WITH PLENTY OF SUN AND
WINDS GETTING LIGHTER AND LIGHTER.


.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...OVERALL...A FAIRLY 
ACTIVE LONGTERM. STILL SOME DISAGREEMENT ON TIMING OF THE WEEKEND 
SYSTEM BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF. WILL STILL TREND TOWARD THE SLOWER 
ECMWF SOLUTION AS DID THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. DIDNT ALTER POPS MUCH 
AT ALL AS PREVIOUS GRIDS STILL LOOK VERY REASONABLE BASED ON LATEST 
DATA. THE FIRST FEW PERIODS OF THE LONG TERM LOOK CALM...BUT THINGS 
BEGIN TO CHANGE ON FRIDAY AS A CLOUDY AND WET WEEKEND LOOK TO BE IN 
STORE WITH CLEARING CONDITIONS EXPECTED BY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. A 
BIG WARMING TREND FOR BOTH HIGHS AND LOWS WILL TAKE PLACE THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND WITH TEMPS RETURNING TO NORMAL BY MONDAY BEHIND A COLD FRONT.

WEAK RIDGING FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT WHICH SHOULD 
PROVIDE CALM AND PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT LOWS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. THURSDAY HIGHS IN THE 
MID TO UPPER 50S WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE MID 30S TO NEAR 40. 
MOSTLY ZONAL FLOW BEGINS TO SHIFT TO MORE OF A SW FLOW THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY IN RESPONSE TO A DEEPENING TROUGH ACROSS THE 
WESTERN US. CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE ON FRIDAY DUE TO AN INCREASINGLY 
MOIST SW FLOW ALONG WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS THROUGH THE DAY DUE TO 
ISENTROPIC LIFT. KEPT THE SAME LINE OF THINKING AS PREVIOUS FORECAST 
WITH LESSER CHANCES FOR SHOWERS ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA DUE TO SLIGHT 
DOWN SLOPING WINDS ON FRIDAY. HIGHS ON FRIDAY EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 
UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S.

CHANCES FOR SHOWERS INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY AS THE 
WESTERN TROUGH CONTINUES TO DEEPEN OVER TEXAS AND PUSH MORE 
MOISTURE UP INTO OUR AREA OUT OF THE GULF. GFS SOUNDINGS SHOW PWS 
RANGING FROM 1.4 TO 1.6 INCHES SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WHICH IS VERY 
MOIST FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR AND PUTS US NEAR THE 99TH PERCENTILE 
COMPARED TO NORMAL PW VALUES. HOWEVER...THE MODELS SHOW NEGATIVE 
TILTING WHICH WILL FORCE THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER OVER TEXAS TO RACE 
UP TOWARD THE OHIO RIVE VALLEY THEREFORE KEEPING THE MAIN PRECIP 
AXIS BACK OFF TO OUR WEST ON SATURDAY. HAVING SAID THAT...WE COULD 
STILL PICK UP A FEW INCHES OF RAINFALL BETWEEN SATURDAY AND MONDAY 
WITH THE BULK OF IT LIKELY OCCURRING ON SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT AS A 
STRONG COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. SOUNDINGS SHOW ROUGHLY 100 
J/KG CAPE ON SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY SO CANT RULE OUT A RUMBLE 
OF THUNDER OR TWO. MOST AREAS WILL SEE HIGHS OVER THE WEEKEND IN THE 
MID 60S WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS IN THE 50S. 

THE HEAVIEST PRECIP IS OFF TO OUR EAST BY MONDAY ALONG WITH THE 
DEPARTED COLD FRONT. HOWEVER...ANOTHER WAVE OF ENERGY QUICKLY MOVES 
THROUGH AND WILL ALLOW FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT SHOWERS TO 
LINGER THROUGH THE EARLY PART OF THE DAY ON MONDAY AREA WIDE AND 
ACROSS NE TN AND SW VA INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS IF THERE IS ENOUGH 
MOISTURE PRESENT. THE POST FRONTAL AIRMASS WILL RESULT IN MONDAYS 
HIGHS RETURNING BACK INTO THE UPPER 40S TO NEAR 50 WITH LOWS IN THE 
UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S FOR MONDAY NIGHT. CALM AND CLEAR CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED ON TUESDAY AS WE BEGIN TO RETURN TO A ZONAL FLOW WITH NEAR 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY TODAY. HOWEVER...THIS SYSTEM IS
MOISTURE STARVED AND SHOULD MAINLY IMPACT TRI WHERE THE DEEPER
MOISTURE WILL BE PRESENT. DECENT PRESSURE GRADIENT FORMS AS THE
COLDER AIR STREAMS SOUTHEAST INTO THE REGION AND THIS WILL RESULT
IN A HEALTHY WEST TO EVENTUALLY NORTHWEST BREEZE AROUND 15 KTS WITH
SOME HIGHER GUSTS. TYS COULD SEE A BROKEN CEILING JUST ABOVE MVFR
CATEGORY BUT CEILING HEIGHT MAY BECOME MVFR AT TRI NEAR MID DAY AND
DROP TO JUST ABOVE IFR CATEGORY EARLY THIS EVENING. THERE COULD BE
A LIGHT SPRINKLE HERE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND POSSIBLY A COUPLE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH EMBEDDED 
IN THE BROAD CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TODAY AND TONIGHT. COOLING TEMPS ALOFT WILL 
ARRIVE IN THE AFTERNOON...AND WILL BRING INCREASING CLOUDS TO 
NORTHERN AREAS. WINDS WILL BECOME GUSTY LATE TODAY WITH THE SURFACE 
FRONTAL PASSAGE...BUT SHOULD STAY JUST BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. 
STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL PROVIDE INSTABILITY FOR SHOWERS 
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
INITIALLY THE SHOWERS WILL BE RAIN...THEN CHANGE TO SNOW AFTER 
SUNSET AS TEMPS DROP QUICKLY. SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS LESS THAN 1 
INCH MAY OCCUR IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS BEFORE THE PRECIP ENDS...WHICH 
IS EXPECTED TO BE AROUND MIDNIGHT ONCE THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVES 
EAST AND MIDLEVELS STABILIZE AND DRY OUT. 

A RIDGE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY...PROVIDING SUNNY 
SKIES AND A WARMING TREND. WITH THE RIDGE AXIS TO OUR EAST AND A 
STRENGTHENING SW FLOW...TEMPS ON THURSDAY WILL RISE INTO THE UPPER 
50S TO NEAR 60 IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WENT CLOSER TO THE 
SLOWER GFS FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS AND THEN FOLLOWED THE ECMWF WHICH 
SLOWS A BIT LATE IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD. LIKED THE GFS THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WHICH IN ADDITION TO BEING SLOWER TO BRING LIGHT 
SHOWERS INTO THE FORECAST AREA...ALSO HAS A MORE REALISTIC LOOK TO 
THE NORTHERN REACHES OF THE GREAT VALLEY THAT OFTEN TIMES ENJOYS 
RAIN SHADOWING AS SOUTHERLY FLOW FORMS ACROSS THE BLUE RIDGE 
MOUNTAINS. THEREFORE GRADUALLY ADJUSTED POPS HIGHER DURING THE DAY 
FRIDAY WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OVER THE NORTHERN VALLEY. 
ISENTROPIC LIFT STRENGTHENS IN INCREASINGLY MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND MAINTAINED THE GOOD CHANCE EAST THROUGH LIKELY WEST 
SCENARIO HERE. MAJOR SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE BECOMES NEGATIVELY 
TILTED DURING THE DAY SATURDAY CAUSING THE FLOW TO BACK ALLOWING 
EVEN MORE OF A CROSS TERRAIN LOOK TO THE LOW LEVEL WINDS. 
THEREFORE...THERE MAY BE A PERCEPTIBLE DECREASE IN SHOWER ACTIVITY 
ON SATURDAY SO TRIED TO INDICATE THIS WITH JUST HIGH CHANCE POPS IN 
THE VALLEY AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER LIKELY PROBABILITIES ON THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN FEATURES. GRADUALLY INCREASED POPS SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE 
UPPER TROUGH LIFTS OUT THROUGH THE MID MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEY 
WHILE STAYING WITH THE HIGH LIKELY POPS ON SUNDAY AS THE BRUNT OF 
THE SYSTEM BUILDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS MAINTAINED SOME 
INSTABILITY WITH THE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON SUNDAY SO KEPT A CHANCE 
OF THUNDER GOING. WITH UNCERTAINTY A LITTLE HIGHER AT THIS REMOTE 
PERIOD OF THE FORECAST AND FOLLOWING THE SLIGHTLY SLOWER 
ECMWF...STAYED WITH A GO SLOW APPROACH TO THE SYSTEM DEPARTURE 
SUNDAY NIGHT. BOTH THE GFS AND ECM INDICATE SOME TRAILING MOISTURE 
AND SHORT WAVE ENERGY ON MONDAY WHICH MAY KEEP A FEW SHOWERS AROUND 
MAINLY DURING THE MORNING HOURS. PRECIPITATION APPEARS TO BE PRETTY 
MUCH GONE BY LATE AFTERNOON WITH DRY...COLD ADVECTION BUILDING IN 
FOR MONDAY NIGHT.

MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO THE WINDS THIS EVENING...BUT OTHERWISE THE
FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK. AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE
WILL PROMOTE CLEAR CONDITIONS...THOUGH SOME PASSING CLOUD COVER OVER
FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WILL BE POSSIBLE
LATE TONIGHT AS AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVES SWINGS SOUTHEAST FROM THE
GREAT LAKES. TEMPERATURES WHICH HAD PEAKED IN THE 50S TODAY HAVE
ALREADY FALLEN BACK INTO THE 30S IN MOST SPOTS ALREADY. HOWEVER...WITH
DEWPOINTS RUNNING IN THE UPPER 20S AND MID 30S...LOWS WILL NOT DROP
OFF TOO DRAMATICALLY OVER THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT /ESPECIALLY WITH
SOME 5-10 MPH SOUTHERLY WINDS HELPING TO KEEP THE BOUNDARY LAYER
MIXED/. AS A RESULT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD BOTTOM OUT IN THE 30-35
DEGREE RANGE IN MOST SPOTS BY DAYBREAK...WITH SOME UPPER 20S
EXPECTED ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...IN THE UPPER LEVELS WE ARE
UNDER A NWLY FLOW THAT IS QUIET TONIGHT...BUT HAS A SIGNIFICANT
DYNAMIC SHORT WAVE IN THE FLOW FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...IT
LOOKS LIKE THE DYNAMICS WILL STAY JUST NORTH OF THE AREA AND ALSO
HAS MINIMAL MOISTURE WITH WHICH TO WORK. WILL MENTION SPRINKLES OR
FLURRIES IN THE EXTREME NORTHERN SECTIONS...OTHERWISE WILL KEEP IT
DRY TUESDAY AFTERNOON.

FOR TEMPS...WENT CLOSE TO GFS MOS GUIDANCE...SLIGHTLY COOLER 
NORTHERN SECTIONS DUE TO CLOUD COVER TUESDAY AFTERNOON. ALSO...
MADE MAX TEMP EARLY IN THE AFTERNOON AND COOLED TEMPS FAIRLY
QUICKLY IN THE LATTER PARTS OF THE AFTERNOON.

FOR FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS...WINDS WILL BE GUSTY TUESDAY...BUT RH 
VALUES WILL ONLY BE LOWERING TO ROUGHLY 50 PERCENT AT MOST 
LOCATIONS...MAYBE A LITTLE LOWER IN SW NC.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...LONG TERM PERIODS WILL 
START OUT DRY PROBABLY INTO EARLY FRIDAY. SOME COLD AIR ADVECTION 
BEHIND THE PASSING WEAK SHORTWAVE TUESDAY...WHICH KEEPS MIN TEMPS 
BELOW CLIMO FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND ALSO KEEPS WEDNESDAY MAX TEMPS 
JUST A COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW CLIMO.

THE WARM-UP WILL BE QUITE NOTICABLE ON THURSDAY INTO THE WEEKEND... 
WITH MAX TEMPS JUMPING ABOUT 10 DEGREES ON THURSDAY WITH SRN STREAM 
SW FLOW PLUS SOUTH LOW LEVEL FLOW. MOISTURE INCREASES FROM FRIDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY...JUSTIFYING INCREASING POPS. HOWEVER...WE MAY 
SEE A BREAK IN ROUNDS OF SHOWERS OVER THE WEEKEND. SOME TIMING 
DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS...SO I DID NOT MAKE ANY 
MAJOR ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUS GRIDS. MODELS SEEM TO SLOW THE ONSET 
OF SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...THUS I KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR NE AREAS 
FOR NOW. 12Z GFS MODEL KEEPS LIGHT PRECIPITATION THROUGH EARLY 
MONDAY NIGHT WHILE ECMWF MOVES MOISTURE OUT OF THE REGION ON MONDAY. 
CHANCE POPS CARRIED FOR MONDAY DAYTIME AND MOSTLY DRY MONDAY NIGHT. 

OTHERWISE...TEMPERATURES ON THE RISE UNTIL FRONTAL PASSAGE SUNDAY 
NIGHT OR EARLY MONDAY. CANT RULE OUT A FEW LOWER 70S FOR HIGHS ON 
THE WEEKEND...IF SHOWERS MOVE OUT AND ANY BREAKS OF SUNSHINE OCCUR. 
FOUND THE 16/12Z GFSX MOS CLOSE TO 16/00Z MOS...AND BLENDED WITH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
SECONDARY COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH A COLD AIR MASS 
LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A LARGE 
AREA OF CLOUDS LINGERING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH THESE 
CLOUDS EXTENDING AS FAR WEST AS THE MS RIVER VALLEY WITH ONLY SLOW

AGREEMENT EARLY ON...BUT INTERMODEL AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IS 
POOR BY THE END OF THE PERIOD. SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL 
BRUSH BY TO OUR NORTH MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. WILL SEE SOME CLOUDS 
ESPECIALLY NORTH BUT MOISTURE WILL BE SHALLOW.  CANNOT TOTALLY RULE 
OUT A BIT OF DRIZZLE OR FREEZING DRIZZLE NORTH BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP 
THE FORECAST FOR BOTH PERIODS PRECIP FREE.  DRIER AIR WILL MOVE IN 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WE SHOULD SEE DRY CONDITIONS WITH A WARMING TREND 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  BY FRIDAY THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL BE 
APPROACHING.  MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT A COLD FRONT WILL 
AFFECT THE REGION FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND...BUT DETAILS ON HOW FAST 
IT MOVES IN AS WELL AS ANY WAVES OF LOW PRESSURE ON THE FRONT ARE 
QUITE UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME GIVEN THE POOR CONSISTENCY MENTIONED 
ABOVE. LOOKS LIKE ANY PRECIP FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WILL MOST LIKELY 
BE LIQUID...AND FOR NOW WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY THROUGH 
SUNDAY...EXCEPT FOR LOW LIKELY FRIDAY NIGHT.  HOWEVER...FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE IS BELOW AVERAGE FOR THESE LAST FEW PERIODS AT THIS TIME.

OBS ACROSS THE AREA SHOW COLDER AIR BUILDING IN FROM THE WEST. WITH 
DRIZZLE IN NORTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS...SOME ICY PATCHES WILL BE 
POSSIBLE THIS MORNING. WILL CONTINUE TO HANDLE THIS WITH A SPS. 

OVERCAST CLOUDS EXTEND WELL WEST OF THE MS RIVER...BUT SOME EROSION 
OF THE CLOUD DECK IS EXPECTED THROUGH THE AFTERNOON WITH DAYTIME 
MIXING..MAINLY IN SOUTHERN AND WESTERN SECTION. MODELS MAY BE 
CLEARING THE CLOUDS OUT TOO QUICKLY...SO WILL LEAN TOWARD MORE CLOUD 
COVER AND COOLER TEMPS. TEMPS WILL NOT RISE MUCH THROUGH THE DAY 
WITH COLD ADVECTION AND CLOUD COVER. CLOUDS LINGER THROUGH TONIGHT 
IN NORTHERN AREAS WITH THE PASSAGE OF A WEAK VORT MAX IN THE NW FLOW.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL START THE LONG-TERM FORECAST WITH A
SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND
NORTHEAST MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE ASSOCIATED MOISTURE WILL MOVE AS
FAR SOUTH AS THE THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. WILL INCLUDE PERIODS OF
MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY..OTHERWISE DRY AREA-WIDE.

FOR MID-WEEK FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL WITH SURFACE RIDGING PRODUCING 
WARMER CONDITIONS AND CONTINUED DRY WEATHER.  FOR THE LATTER HALF OF 
THE WEEK/EARLY WEEKEND...A STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL ESTABLISH ITSELF 
OVER THE ROCKIES WITH UPPER FLOW BECOMING SOUTHWEST. SURFACE RIDGING 
WILL ALSO MOVE EAST ALLOWING GULF MOISTURE TO RETURN INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. INCREASING ISENTROPIC 
LIFT ALONG WITH AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL INCREASE 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES BY FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. GFS AND ECMWF HAVE 
DIFFERENCE EVOLUTIONS OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE ECMWF SHOWS A 
SLOWER EASTWARD MOVEMENT. WILL CALL FOR HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS 
BEGINNING LATE FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.

BELOW 800 MB LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SUNDAY 
MORNING...WITH A MID-LEVEL INVERSION DEVELOPING OVER THE TOP OF IT. 
THUS...EXPECT CLOUDY SKIES AND AREAS OF DRIZZLE TO LINGER THROUGH 
SUNDAY MORNING. IN FACT...THIS SHALLOW BOUNDARY LAYER OF MOISTURE 
APPEARS TO BE RIGHT AT THE TEMP THRESHOLD FOR SUPER-COOLED WATER TO 
CHANGE OVER TO SNOW...BUT PRECIP LATE TONIGHT MIGHT REMAIN AS RAIN

ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO ADDRESS THE POSSIBILITY OF A 
LIGHT ICE GLAZE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATE TONIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE 
THEN BUILDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT... 
WITH A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE BRINGING AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS 
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BUT 
WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE FIRST PART OF THIS 
PERIOD IS PRETTY QUIET WITH THE ONLY CHANCE OF PRECIP BEING CENTERED 
ON LATE TUESDAY AS A MODERATE DISTURBANCE DIVES TO THE 
SOUTHEAST...JUST CLIPPING OUR NORTHEAST SECTIONS.  HOWEVER...IT 
LOOKS LIKE THE DEEPER LIFT IS REALLY CENTERED FARTHER NORTH...SO 
HAVE LEFT BOTH PERIODS DRY.

THE ONSET OF THE NEXT SYSTEM LOOKS TO BE LATE THURSDAY OR ON FRIDAY 
AS A LARGE SYSTEM FROM THE GULF MOVES INTO THE AREA.  IT LOOKS LIKE 
THIS SYSTEM AT THE ONSET AND DURING ITS MAIN PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE 
ALL LIQUID PRECIP FORM.  THE TAIL-END OF THIS SYSTEM IS BEYOND THIS 
FORECAST BUT COULD OFFER SOME LIGHT UPSLOPE SNOWS FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS.  BEFORE QUICKLY DRYING OUT.  ALSO WITH THIS 
SYSTEM...INSTABILITY STILL LOOKS WEAK...SO HAVE LEFT THUNDER OUT FOR 
NOW.  LOOKS LIKE NO WIND EVENT FOR NOW AS THIS SYSTEM APPROACHES.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED NEAR

RADARS REVEAL A LARGE AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA...WITH SOME REPORTS OF SNOW AND SLEET OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...A STRONG WARM AIR 
ADVECTION PATTERN AHEAD OF THIS LOW WILL CONTINUE TO PUSH TEMPS INTO

FORECAST AREA AROUND SUNSET THIS EVENING. A FAIRLY STRONG 850 MB 
SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW WAS ALSO OCCURRING OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING...WITH A STABLE LAYER OCCURRING OVER THE MOUNTAINS. THUS... 
IT APPEARS THAT WINDS WILL CONTINUE TO BE GUSTY IN THE FOOTHILLS DUE 
TO MOUNTAIN WAVES. CAMP CREEK AND COVE MOUNTAIN WIND TOWERS HAVE 
ALREADY REPORTED WIND GUSTS UP TO 45 TO 50 MPH EARLY THIS MORNING... 
BUT THINK THAT SUSTAINED WINDS WILL REMAIN BELOW 25 MPH TODAY...SO 
WILL NOT ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE FOOTHILLS.
 
MOST OF THIS RAIN THIS MORNING SHOULD TRANSITION TO AREAS OF DRIZZLE 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH COLDER AIR WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE REGION 
TONIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE 
LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT...AS SUB-FREEZING AIR 
MOVES ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THIS SHALLOW BOUNDARY LAYER 
MOISTURE WILL BE POSSIBLY COLD ENOUGH TO CHANGE OVER TO FREEZING 
DRIZZLE OR SNOW AFTER MIDNIGHT. THUS...MAY NEED TO CONSIDER A WINTER 
WX ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET AFTER MIDNIGHT 
TONIGHT. WILL WAIT UNTIL THE 12Z MODEL RUNS HAVE COMPLETELY ARRIVED 
BEFORE MAKING THE FINAL DECISION.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO

RAIN WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA IN ASSOCIATED WITH GOOD Q-G FORCING 
WITH A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND JET. A DEEP WARM LAYER 
SHOULD KEEP ALL PRECIP AS LIQUID THIS MORNING...WITH WARM ADVECTION 
OFFSETTING EVAPORATIVE COOLING. THE MAIN SHOT OF PRECIP MOVES

WILL END BY 18Z. POPS WILL DROP QUICKLY TO JUST A CHANCE BY 21Z AS A 
DRY SLOT MOVES OVERHEAD AND MOISTURE BECOME CONFINED BELOW 800 MB. 
WEAK 850 MB CONVERGENCE WITH THE TROUGH PASSAGE PROVIDES SOME WEAK 
LIFT FOR AREAS OF DRIZZLE OVERNIGHT. COLD ADVECTION KICKS IN AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...WITH A UPSLOPE NW FLOW. LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...BUT GENERALLY 
LESS THAN ONE INCH IS EXPECTED. SOME PARTIAL CLEARING OF CLOUDS MAY 
ARRIVE FROM THE WEST IN THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT TROUGH FRIDAY)...
A GENERALLY QUIET AND DRY PERIOD UNTIL WE GET TO THE VERY END.
STILL EXPECTING A WARMING TREND FOR NEXT WEEK...WENT MORE TOWARD
THE WARMER ECMWF TEMPERATURES THAN THE GFS. WEATHER SYSTEM FOR THE
END OF THE WEEK LOOKS POTENTIALLY FOREBODING. BOTH GFS AND ECMWF
INDICATE A SLOW MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO
VALLEYS FROM FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WITH A NOTABLY MOIST GULF FLOW
FEEDING THE WARM SECTOR. PRECIPITATION MAY BE FAIRLY EFFICIENT IN
THIS SET UP...AND RAINS OF A DAY OR TWO DURATION SOMEWHERE IN
MIDDLE OR EAST TENNESSEE MAY ACCUMULATE ON THE ORDER OF SEVERAL
INCHES. BEING OUT IN THE DAY 7 TIME FRAME AND BEYOND...THE MODELS
WILL LIKELY STRUGGLE TO PIN IT DOWN BEFORE EARLY NEXT WEEK. WHAT
MATERIALIZES WILL DEPEND ON THE STRENGTH OF THE WESTERN TROUGH AND
THE SW FETCH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. THEN...HOW MUCH OF A TROPICAL
TAP WILL ALL OF THIS MAY MUSTER? BUT THE SITUATION BEARS MONITORING
PRIMARILY FOR PLACEMENT OF HEAVY PRECIP AXIS.

VERY MINOR TWEAKS TO THE FORECAST MADE THIS EVENING AS JUST INTRODUCED

CHANCE OVER TO SNOW IN AREAS OVER 2800 FEET OR SO. AS A RESULT...UP

PLAINS. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY OUT AHEAD OF THIS DEVELOPING LOW...WITH MOISTURE 
PROGGED TO CONTINUE INCREASING OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AS 
THIS LOW MOVES EASTWARD. WITH A VERY DRY LOW-LEVEL AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...THINK THAT IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE 
INITIAL PRECIP TO REACH THE GROUND...WITH MOST OF THE MEASURABLE 
PRECIP AFTER MIDNIGHT. THIS VERY DRY AIR MASS WILL ALSO CREATE SOME 
EVAPORATIVE COOLING WITH THE INITIAL PRECIP...WITH SOME LIGHT SNOW 
POSSIBLE OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...A 
STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN OVER THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD 
CAUSE THIS INITIAL LIGHT SNOW TO BE BRIEF IN DURATION...WITH LOWS 
TONIGHT LIKELY OCCURRING DURING THE EVENING HOURS WITH TEMPS THEN 
SLOWLY RISING OVERNIGHT. STRONG 850 MB SOUTHERLY WINDS ARE ALSO 
PROGGED BY THE NAM MODEL TO DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SATURDAY MORNING...WITH A STABLE LAYER OCCURRING OVER THE MOUNTAINS. 
THUS...IT APPEARS THAT WINDS COULD BE GUSTY IN THE FOOTHILLS DUE TO 
MOUNTAIN WAVES. HOWEVER...THE GFS MODEL 850 MB WINDS ARE WEAKER AND 
FURTHER NORTH THAN THE NAM MODEL...SO WILL NOT ISSUE ANY WIND 
ADVISORIES WITH THIS FORECAST ISSUANCE DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTIES WITH 
THE STRENGTH OF THE 850 MB WINDS.

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE BULK OF THE RAINFALL WITH THIS 
NEXT SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE MORNING HOURS 
ON SATURDAY. A SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE THEN LINGERS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...WHICH 
SHOULD RESULT IN CLOUDY SKIES AND AREAS OF DRIZZLE. IN FACT...THIS 
SHALLOW LOW-LEVEL LAYER OF MOISTURE APPEARS TO POSSIBLY NOT COOL 
ENOUGH TO CHANGE OVER TO SNOW LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL 
CONTINUE TO MENTION A CHANCE FOR SNOW LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY MORNING SINCE THE TEMP PROFILE APPEARS TO BE RIGHT AT THE 
THRESHOLD FOR SUPER-COOLED WATER IN THE CLOUD LAYER TO FREEZE. WITH 
A MID-LEVEL INVERSION EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE TOP OF THIS 
MOISTURE LAYER...IT MAY TAKE A WHILE FOR CLOUDS TO COMPLETELY ERODE 
ON SUNDAY...SO WILL BE MORE PESSIMISTIC WITH THE CLOUD FORECAST. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PERIOD 
A LARGE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS COVERING MUCH OF THE EASTERN U.S. WITH 
THE AXIS OF THE TROUGH JUST PAST OUR AREA.  AT THE SURFACE...POST 
FRONTAL HIGH PRESSURE HAS BUILT INTO THE AREA...WITH THE SURFACE 
RIDGE ON TOP OF US.  A QUICK RE-ENFORCING FRONT SWEEPS THROUGH THE 
AREA TUESDAY NIGHT...THE 12Z MEX DATA BUMPED UP THE POPS QUITE A 
BIT...BUT WILL HOLD OFF FOLLOWING FOR NOW AS 00Z ENSEMBLE MEMBERS 
WERE ALL MUCH DRIER AND IT LOOKS LIKE PRECIP COULD EASILY STAY 
FARTHER NORTH.

AFTER THIS FRONT MOVES EAST AND THE SURFACE RIDGE PASSES...WE START 
GEARING UP FOR A MORE SIGNIFICANT STORM SYSTEM...WITH THE RETURN 
FLOW OF MOISTURE BUILDING INTO THE PLAINS ON THURSDAY AND SPREADING 
INTO OUR AREA ON FRIDAY.  CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION SHOULD RETURN TO 
THE AREA BY FRIDAY.  LOOKS TO BE A DEEP PUSH OF GULF MOISTURE SO NOT 
ANTICIPATING ANY WINTRY WEATHER WITH THE ONSET OF THIS STORM 
SYSTEM.  MIGHT BE SOME THREAT OF THUNDER...BUT INSTABILITY IS 
EXPECTED TO BE VERY LIMITED...SO JUST HAVE PRECIP AS SHOWERS NOW.  
ANY POTENTIAL FOR POST-FRONTAL NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWS ARE BEYOND THIS 
FORECAST...LOOKS LIKE SOME POTENTIAL FOR THAT...BUT MODELS ARE 
WAFFLING ON POST-FRONTAL MOISTURE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
HIGH CLOUDS WILL BE BUILDING ACROSS THE AREA TODAY AS A SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES FROM THE FOUR CORNERS REGION ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF 
THIS SYSTEM AND QPF AMOUNTS. IT LOOKS LIKE A QUICK SHOT OF 
RAIN...OCCURRING MAINLY BETWEEN 09Z AND 18Z...BUT LIFT LOOKS STRONG 
WITH FAVORABLE UPPER JET POSITIONING AND A 40-50 KT LLJ PROVIDING 
GOOD MOISTURE ADVECTION. WITH THIS SOUTHERLY LLJ...WINDS MAY 
APPROACH ADVISORY CRITERIA IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND FOOTHILLS. 
INITIALLY...LOW LEVELS WILL BE DRY...SO POPS HAVE BEEN PUSHED BACK 
TO AFTER MIDNIGHT. PRECIP COULD BEGIN AS SNOW IN HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...BUT CHANCES OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ABOVE ONE INCH LOOK 
VERY SLIM WITH A DEEP WARM NOSE IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS AND STRONG 
WARM ADVECTION OVERNIGHT. POPS WILL BE CATEGORICAL SATURDAY MORNING 
ONCE THE COLUMN FULLY MOISTENS. RAPID DRYING ALOFT OCCURS SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON AS THE UPPER JET MOVES OVERHEAD. WILL SPEED UP THE 
DECREASE IN POPS...LOWERING INTO THE CHANCE RANGE EVERYWHERE AFTER 
21Z. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT TROUGH THURSDAY)...
THE OPENING 18 HOURS OF THIS PERIOD /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MIDDAY
SUNDAY/ WILL EXPERIENCE THE REMAINS OF THE DEPARTING WEATHER
SYSTEM...PROBABLY SOME UPSLOPE AND WEAKLY CONVECTIVE SHOWERY
PRECIP...SOME OF WHICH MAY MIX WITH OR SWITCH TO FLURRIES BETWEEN
06Z AND 18Z SUNDAY. DRIER AIR INTRUDING INTO AREA WILL FINALLY KILL
OFF THIS WEAK ACTIVITY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...AND THEN HIGH PRESSURE
WILL KEEP A FIRMLY DRY HOLD ON THE AREA THROUGH THE REST OF THE
PERIOD /SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THURSDAY/. LOOKS LIKE TEMPS WILL
WARM UP WITH VALLEY HIGHS BEING MOSTLY IN THE 50S FOR THE UPCOMING
WORK WEEK...A NICE CHANGE FROM THIS CURRENT CHILLY WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR MEMPHIS 
TN...WITH A LEE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. THIS HIGH IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING 
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON FRIDAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE 
FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A VERY DRY 
LOW-LEVEL AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA AS MID- TO 
HIGH-LEVEL MOISTURE SPREADS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. SOME 
EVAPORATIVE COOLING PROCESSES ASSOCIATED WITH THE INITIAL PRECIP 
SHOULD HELP TO CREATE SOME LIGHT SNOW INITIALLY OVER SOUTHWEST VA 
AND NORTHEAST TN...BUT THIS PRECIP SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT UNTIL AFTER 
SUNRISE ON SATURDAY WHEN TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO RISE ABOVE FREEZING. 
THUS...DO NOT EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS...BUT 
UP TO AN INCH MAY STILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 
2500 FEET. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL THEN MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS 
THE DEEP SOUTH ON SATURDAY...BRINGING RAIN OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST 
AREA THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING. COLDER AIR BEHIND THIS SYSTEM WILL 
THEN RE-ENTER THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT ON SATURDAY NIGHT... 
WITH LIGHT RAIN (OR DRIZZLE) CHANGING BACK TO LIGHT SNOW OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. IT APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE MOISTURE WITH THIS 
SYSTEM WILL BE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH 
ONLY SOME SHALLOW LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINING. THUS...DO NOT EXPECT 
MUCH IN THE WAY OF SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS...EXCEPT POSSIBLY OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN WHERE UP TO AN 
INCH WILL AGAIN BE POSSIBLE ABOVE 2500 FEET. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT... 
AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...ON SUNDAY...COOLER AIR AND 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WILL ROTATE IN AS SATURDAY/S SYSTEM PULLS AWAY 
FROM THE AREA. THIS WILL ALLOW A FEW LINGERING RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS 
TO HANG OVER MAINLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS FOR MUCH OF THE DAY. WITH 
LIMITED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...NOT EXPECTING MUCH...IF ANY IN THE WAY 
OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. MONDAY AND TUESDAY...SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN 
WITH FLOW ALOFT BECOMING RATHER ZONAL. THIS WILL USHER IN A DRYING 
AND WARMING TREND. THE TAIL END OF A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE IN 
AROUND THE WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY TIME FRAME. MOISTURE AND LIFT QUITE 
WEAK AND ONLY EXPECT TO SEE A MINOR BAND OF MID LEVEL CLOUDS AT THIS

A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS MOVING TROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
EARLY THIS MORNING...BRINGING A REINFORCING SHOT OF CANADIAN AIR
INTO THE REGION...AND AN AREA OF SCT TO BKN LOWER STATUS CLOUDS
ALONG THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND THE CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS. IN
GENERAL...MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE ACROSS MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA FOR MOST OF THE NIGHT...BUT THESE CLOUDS SHOULD
EXPAND SOUTHWARD AND LINGER THROUGH AT LEAST PART OF THE
MORNING...BEFORE THE SKY COMPLETELY CLEARS BY THE LATE MORNING AND
INTO THE AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE PREVAILING NORTHERLY FLOW AND THE
COOL/DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE...HIGHS TODAY WILL BE EVEN LOWER AS THEY
WILL ONLY REACH THE 30S TO AROUND 40 DEGREES. THEN...WITH MOSTLY
CLEAR CONDITIONS AND CALM WINDS EXPECTED LATER TONIGHT LOWS WILL
BOTTOM OUT IN THE TEENS TO LOWER 20S ONCE AGAIN. 

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
MAIN WEATHER SYSTEM FOR THE EXTENDED PERIODS WILL BE DEVELOPING
FRIDAY NIGHT...MUCH IN LINE WITH EARLIER MODEL RUNS. THIS SOUTHERN
STREAM LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS HANDLED SIMILARLY BY ALL BUT
NAM...WHICH HAS TRENDED DRIER FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...THE
WETTER GFS HAS SUPPORT OF ECMWF/CANADIAN AND SREF...SO I STILL
SPREAD PRECIPITATION (MOSTLY RAIN) NE INTO ALL AREAS BY 06Z TO 12Z
SATURDAY. SURFACE AND 850 MB LOW POSITION INDICATES SE TO S LOW
LEVEL FLOW...THUS I KEPT POPS BELOW LIKELY FOR NE TN AND SW VA WITH
LOWEST POPS OVER NRN VALLEY COUNTIES...WHERE DOWNSLOPE FLOW SHOULD
INHIBIT MEASURABLE RAIN UP TO 12Z SATURDAY.

VERY WET SATURDAY THEN COLDER AIR WILL INFILTRATE ON THE BACK SIDE 
OF THE EXITING LOW LATE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. THIS ALLOWS A 
CHANGE OVER OR MIX WITH LIGHT SNOW...MAINLY FOR NRN PLATEAU/SW VA/
NRN MTNS OF E TN. A CONSENSUS OF MODELS SHOWS SLIGHTLY CYCLONIC FLOW 
ALOFT THROUGH AT LEAST 18Z SUNDAY...WITH GFS KEEPING JUST ENOUGH 
LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO SUPPORT LOW POPS ON SUNDAY. THE 
LIKELIHOOD OF ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL IS VERY LOW AT THIS TIME.

UPPER FLOW IS NORTHWEST AND GULF MOISTURE STILL CUT OFF FOR EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...SO WILL CONTINUE THE DRY FORECAST FOR MONDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. 12Z AND 00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE QUITE CLOSE AND GENERALLY

LIQUID FORM AT THE ONSET OF THE EVENT SATURDAY MORNING. COULD BE A 
MIXTURE OF LIGHT SLEET AND SNOW TO START OVER MUCH OF THE REMAINDER 
OF THE FORECAST AREA INCLUDING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. 
HOWEVER...ENOUGH WARM AIR DOES RETURN BY MID DAY WITH ONLY RAIN 
EXPECTED DURING THE AFTERNOON. TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND 
MOISTURE BUILD ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AND THE 
AIR SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR THE PRECIP TO FALL IN THE FORM OF 
LIGHT SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. PROBABILITY OF PRECIP 
WILL BE LOWER ACROSS CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE BUT THERE COULD BE A 
BRIEF PERIOD OF LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES LATER SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
SUNDAY MORNING. THE TRAILING SYSTEM SHOULD BE MOVING OUT BY SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHEST 
TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND SMOKY MOUNTAINS OF TENNESSEE. 
THE REST OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD COULD REMAIN DRY EVEN WITH A 
FRONTAL PASSAGE EARLY IN THE WEEK. LOOKS LIKE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
WILL NOT BE AVAILABLE WITH THE GULF CUT OFF BY A NICE SURFACE RIDGE 
OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL U.S.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS ARE PREVAILING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION EARLY THIS MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE HAS BUILT
IN AT THE SURFACE. THE CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS HAVE ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO DROP TO THEIR COOLEST LEVELS OF THE MONTH SO
FAR...INTO THE UPPER TEENS TO MID 20S ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN
ZONES. LATER TODAY...SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AND MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS
WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB BACK INTO THE 40S TO AROUND 50
DEGREES BY THE AFTERNOON. THEN...A WEAK DRY SHORTWAVE/FRONT WILL
MOVE THROUGH THE AREA LATER TONIGHT...SHIFTING WINDS TO THE
NORTHWEST AND BRINGING IN ANOTHER REINFORCING SHOT OF COLDER
AIR...DROPPING SOME SHELTERED AREAS INTO THE MIDDLE TO UPPER
TEENS...WITH LOWER 20S PREVAILING IN MOST OTHER LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
FIND MODELS QUITE CONSISTENT WITH THE EARLY PERIODS OF THE
EXTENDED INTO SUNDAY. CONTINUED SUPPORT FOR HIGH POPS BY
SATURDAY...AS STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPS AHEAD OF THE SRN
STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS SHOULD SEND MOSTLY RAIN
OUR WAY...ALTHO THE DRY LOW LEVELS NOTED IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS WILL
ALLOW FOR EVAPORATIONAL COOLING. PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS
LOOKED GREAT FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. I CHOSE TO STAY WITH
CHANCE POPS FOR NE TN AND SW VA FOR NOW...AS THE DRY LOW LEVELS AND
A HINT OF SE DOWNSLOPE FLOW SHOULD INHIBIT MEASURABLE PCPN UNTIL
AFTER 12Z SATURDAY IN THOSE AREAS.

RAIN DIMINISHING FROM THE WEST SATURDAY NIGHT WITH A MIX OR BRIEF 
CHANGE TO LIGHT SNOW IN NRN AREAS...AS IN CURRENT GRIDS. THREAT OF 
ANY SNOW FOR SUNDAY DOES NOT LOOK VERY IMPRESSIVE. THE UPPER FLOW IS 
QUICKLY ZONAL WITH NO INDICATION OF ANY WRAP AROUND MOISTURE. IN 
FACT ANY LINGERING MOISTURE BY 15Z TO 18Z SUNDAY IS BARELY SURFACE 
TO 850 MBS. THUS...I LOWERED THE SUNDAY POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR NE 
AREAS AND ERN MTNS BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...AND ALSO DROPPED POPS FOR 
SUNDAY NIGHT. 

OTHERWISE...KEEPING THU...FRI...MON AND TUE DRY AS IN PREVIOUS 
GRIDS. 11/00Z GFS MOS TEMPS VERY CLOSE TO 10/12Z GFS MOS...EXCEPT 
FOR A LARGE DEVIATION (00Z WARMER) FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE 
ADVERTISED PATTERN IS NOT SUPPORTIVE OF THE MUCH WARMER 00Z MAXES
...SO I STAYED CLOSE TO A BLEND WHICH MESHES WELL WITH ADJACENT NWS 
GRIDS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...
FAIR AND COLD TONIGHT. A BRIEF WARM-UP WEDNESDAY WILL ALLOW
WEDNESDAY TO BE THE WARMEST DAY OF THE TODAY-TO-THURSDAY STRETCH...
BUT SHOULD STILL BE A LITTLE BELOW NORMAL. THOSE MILDER DAYTIME
TEMPS WEDNESDAY WILL BE DUE TO WESTERLY SFC WINDS AHEAD OF THE
NEXT COLD FRONT WHICH WILL USHER IN THE COLDER DAY THURSDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS CONTINUE WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH LOWS IN
THE LOW TO MID 20S. A WEAK UPPER LEVEL WAVE BEGINS TO APPROACHES
THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY BRINGING ANOTHER SHOT OF
COLD AIR. MODELS STILL SHOW THE WAVE STAYING WELL NORTH TO OUR AREA
AND SHOULDNT HAVE TOO BIG OF AN IMPACT OTHER THAN COOLER TEMPS AND
SOME POSSIBLE CLOUDS ACROSS NETN AND SWVA. CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO
CLEAR OUT THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS THE WAVE MOVE FURTHER OFF TO THE
NORTHEAST. HIGHS AND LOWS FOR THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT STILL LOOK TO
BE ROUGHLY 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.
 
FRIDAY STILL LOOKS LIKE A NICE DAY BUT THINGS CHANGE AS WE GET INTO 
FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY. MODELS STILL SHOWING A CUTOFF LOW OFF THE 
COAST OF CALIFORNIA THAT GETS SWEPT UP IN AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
COMING DOWN OUT OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST ON THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY. THE SYSTEM BEGINS TO APPROACH OUR AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY MORNING. TEMPS WARM SLIGHTLY ON FRIDAY OUT AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING WESTERN TROUGH WITH FRIDAY NIGHT TEMPS BEING 10 TO 15 
DEGREES WARMER THAN THURSDAY DUE TO A SHIFT TO A SW FLOW IN THE LOW 
AND MID LEVELS AND INCREASING CLOUDS. RAIN LOOKS TO BEGIN FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE DAY ON SATURDAY AS THE SYSTEM MOVES 
ACROSS OUR AREA. A FEW ISOLATED AREAS ACROSS SWVA AND EXTREME NE TN 
COULD SEE SOME SNOW FLAKES EARLY LATE FRIDAY NIGHT/EARLY SATURDAY 
MORNING BEFORE SWITCHING TO ALL RAIN. A WARM RAIN EXPECTED ON 
SATURDAY AS TEMPS WILL BE NEAR 50 ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND MID 
TO UPPER 40S ELSEWHERE. LATEST MODELS STILL INDICATE THAT SOME 
WINTRY PRECIP IS POSSIBLE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AS COLDER AIR 
GETS PULLED INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. WILL KEEP RAIN OR SNOW 
WORDING IN GRIDS AT THIS TIME. DETERMINING WHETHER WE SEE RAIN OR 
SNOW WILL DEPEND ON HOW SOON THE COLD AIR CAN PULL IN AND HOW MUCH 
PRECIP IS STILL AROUND OUR AREA. THE WEEKEND SYSTEM MOVES OFF TO THE 
EAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT WITH CLEARING CONDITIONS EXPECTED INTO 
MONDAY. MONDAY AND TUESDAY BOTH LOOK NICE WITH CALM WEATHER AND 
CLEAR SKIES. SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES EXPECTED BY TUESDAY WITH 
HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S.

SOME POTENTIAL FOR A BRIEF PERIOD OF ICING. ICE ACCUMS WERE LOWERED

ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND

331 PM EST MON DEC 9 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...
A QUICK HIT OF WINTRY PRECIP WILL DEVELOP TONIGHT...AS COLD AIR
ADVECTS INTO THE CWA FROM THE NW WHILE PRECIP BUILDS IN FROM OUR
SW. FIRST CHANCES FOR WINTRY PRECIP WILL BE THE PLATEAU
COUNTIES...WITH THE WINTER WEATHER LINE EASING SOUTHEASTWARD
THROUGH MORNING. PRECIP MOSTLY ENDS BY 9-11 AM TUES MORNING. PRECIP
WILL MAINLY BE IN FORM OF FREEZING RAIN...COLUMN MAY COOL ENOUGH
BEFORE MOISTURE MOVES OUT TO SEE A SWITCH OVER TO SLEET AND OR SNOW
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE PRECIP SHIELD. WE KNOW TERRAIN WILL HAVE AN
IMPACT ON INDIVIDUAL REPORTS BUT GENERALLY EXPECTING ICE
ACCUMULATIONS TO REMAIN BELOW ONE QUARTER OF AN INCH...ANY SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS TO REMAIN BELOW 2 INCHES. THOSE TWO INCHES OF SNOW
WILL PROBABLY BE RESTRICTED TO ELEVATED UPSLOPE SIDES OF THE
PLATEAU AND THE HIGH KNOB AREA. WARM TONGUE ABOVE THE SURFACE
SHOULD PROHIBIT THE SMOKIES FROM SEEING MUCH. WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY WILL COVER THE PLATEAU DOWN TO MARION COUNTY...SW VA
COUNTIES...AND THE VA BORDER COUNTIES OF NE TN. PRECIP SHOULD BE
UNDERWAY BY LATE EVENING.
 
.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE EXTENDED IS MUCH LESS ACTIVE COMPARED TO THE PATTERN THAT WE
HAVE BEEN STUCK IN SINCE THE MIDDLE OF LAST WEEK. FIRST HALF OF
EXTENDED IS QUIET WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVING IN FRIDAY NIGHT AND
INTO THE WEEKEND.

PRECIP GONE BY TUESDAY NIGHT AS WE RETURN TO A ZONAL FLOW. SKIES
CLEAR TUESDAY NIGHT WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP INTO THE MID 20S AND
UPPER TEENS. CALM CONDITIONS CONTINUE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT
WITH CLEAR SKIES. WEDNESDAY HIGHS ROUGHLY 5 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL
AND WED NIGHT LOWS AROUND 7 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. ANOTHER SHOT OF
COLD AIR...ALONG WITH A WEAK UPPER LEVEL WAVE...APPROACHES THE AREA
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING BUT SHOULD STAY WELL NORTH OF
OUR AREA. THIS SHOULDNT HAVE TOO BIG OF AN IMPACT OTHER THAN
COOLER TEMPERATURES AND SOME POSSIBLE CLOUDS ACROSS NETN AND SWVA.
CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR OUT THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS THE WAVE
MOVE FURTHER OFF TO THE NORTHEAST. HIGHS AND LOWS FOR
THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT LOOK TO BE AROUND 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL.
 
FRIDAY LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE THE LAST NICE WEATHER DAY OF THE PERIOD 
UNTIL CONDITIONS BEGIN TO IMPROVE ON MONDAY. CUTOFF LOW OFF THE 
COAST OF CALIFORNIA GETS SWEPT UP IN AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH COMING 
DOWN OUT OF THE PACIFIC NORTHWEST ON THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. THE 
SYSTEM IS ACROSS TEXAS ON FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND WILL BEGIN TO 
APPROACH OUR AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING. A BRIEF 
RETURN TO A SW FLOW AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM ON FRIDAY WILL INCREASE OUR 
TEMPS FRIDAY AROUND 6 TO 8 DEGREES COMPARED TO THURSDAY. CLOUDS 
INCREASE LATE AFTERNOON INTO FRIDAY EVENING WITH LOWS ABOUT 10 
DEGREES WARMER THAN THURSDAY NIGHT DUE TO SW FLOW AND INCREASED 
CLOUD COVER. RAIN LOOKS TO BEGIN FRIDAY NIGHT AND LOOKS LIKELY 
THROUGH THE DAY ON SATURDAY AS THE SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS OUR AREA. 
TEMPS WILL BE EVEN WARMER ON SATURDAY WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 50S IN 
THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND NEAR 50 FOR THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND NETN. LATEST 
GFS RUN INDICATES THAT THERE COULD BE SOME WINTRY PRECIP LATER 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM AS IT 
PULLS COLDER AIR IN. ITS DIFFICULT TO SAY AT THIS TIME ON HOW MUCH 
IF ANY WINTRY PRECIP WE WILL SEE. THIS IS BECAUSE IT REALLY DEPENDS 
ON HOW/WHEN/WHERE THE CUTOFF LOW AND TROUGH PHASE TOGETHER ON FRIDAY 
AND THEN TRYING TO DETERMINE THE EXACT TRACK OF THAT SYSTEM. THE WEEKEND 
SYSTEM MOVES OFF TO THE EAST SUNDAY AFTERNOON/NIGHT WITH CLEARING 
CONDITIONS EXPECTED INTO MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...RAIN CONTINUES TO TRACK NE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...ALTHOUGH NOT AS SOLID 
COVERAGE OVERALL. SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY WAS NOTED THROUGH 12Z 
TODAY...MAINLY ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC. LATEST TRENDS WERE FOR 
LIGHTNING TO DECREASE TO OUR SOUTH...SO NO MENTION OF TSRA WITH 
TODAYS GRIDS. 

EXPECTING THE RAIN TO TAPER OFF FROM THE WEST THIS AFTERNOON AS THE 
COLD FRONT SLIPS TO OUR EAST. YET ANOTHER WAVE DEVELOPS ON THE FRONT 
EARLY TONIGHT...SPREADING MORE RAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
OVERNIGHT. MODELS TRENDING COLDER FOR LATE TONIGHT AND ON TUESDAY... 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS NRN AREAS. DROPPED TEMPS DOWN AND CHANGED RAIN 
OVER TO LIGHT SNOW OVER NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA...PLUS A MENTION OF 
LIGHT FREEZING RAIN. ALLOWING FOR UP TO 2 INCHES OF SNOW 
ACCUMULATION IN WISE COUNTY VA THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...AND UP TO 1 
INCH OVER THE REMAINDER OF SW VA. KEPT ANY ICING TO JUST A FEW 
HUNDREDTHS FOR NOW. 

NO ADVISORY ISSUED AT THIS POINT...AS CONFIDENCE ON GETTING ADVISORY 
SNOW AMOUNTS IS LOW. UPSLOPE FLOW DOESNT DEVELOP UNTIL 15Z TUESDAY 
WHEN MOISTURE IS DECREASING...AND PROGGED LOW LEVEL CAPE IS LIMITED. 
WILL MENTION THIS WINTRY WX POTENTIAL IN HWO AND A SPECIAL WEATHER 
STATEMENT. 

GFS MOS TEMPS REASONABLE FOR ALL PERIODS...BUT I OPTED FOR COOLER 
TEMPS WHERE SLIGHT DIFFERENCES WERE NOTED.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE FINALLY
SHUTS OFF PRECIPITATION TUESDAY NIGHT. SKIES CLEAR AND TEMPERATURES
DROP INTO THE UPPER TEENS TO MID 20S. DRY TREND TO CONTINUE THROUGH
FRIDAY WITH COOL DAYS AND COLD NIGHTS. WEAK SYSTEM TO PASS JUST
NORTH OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT SO COULD HAVE A FEW CLOUDS OVER 
SW VA. REINFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR MOVES IN THURSDAY AND FRIDAY
FOR MOSTLY SUNNY DAYS AND ANOTHER COLD NIGHT THURSDAY NIGHT. FRIDAY
LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AS SURFACE HIGH
SHIFTS EAST. RETURN FLOW MOISTURE FRIDAY NIGHT OVER COLD AIR MASS
PRODUCES SOME WINTER PRECIPITATION. RIGHT NOW LOOKS LIKE SOME SNOW
OR POSSIBLE FREEZING RAIN LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY
BEFORE TEMPERATURES WARM. THE ONLY AREA AFFECTED BY WINTER
PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND NE TN AND SW VA.
THIS WEEKEND SYSTEM TAKES A MORE SOUTHERN TRACK ALONG THE GULF
COAST AND IF ENOUGH COLD AIR COMES IN ON THE BACK SIDE OF IT THE
RAIN COULD CHANGE TO SNOW SUNDAY. RIGHT NOW WILL KEEP IT MOSTLY A
COLD RAIN BUT LATER SHIFTS MAY NEED TO ADD MORE SNOW.

STREAMS INTO THE AREA.  CURRENT RADAR HAS A BAND OF SHOWERS 
STRETCHING FROM THE GULF COAST OF LA INTO THE MRX CWA.  THIS WILL 
KEEP SHOWERS MOVING THROUGH FOR THE ENTIRE NIGHT WITH OCCASIONAL 
BAND OF HEAVY RAIN AND FEW BREAKS.  ADDITIONALLY...WEAK ELEVATED

A HALF INCHES IS EXPECTED OVER MOST LOCATIONS...THROUGH A FEW AREAS 
COULD SEE ONE AND A HALF TO 2 AND A HALF INCHES OF RAIN POSSIBLE.  
THIS MAY CAUSE LOCALIZED MINOR FLOODING AND PONDING ON AREA ROADS.

323 PM EST SUN DEC 8 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TOMORROW)...THE SAME OVERALL PATTERN
AND THEME CONTINUES DUE TO A MEAN SW FLOW THAT CONTINUES TO STREAM
MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. ANOTHER ROUND OF MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY
RAIN IS NOW ENTERING THE SOUTHERN VALLEY...SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA
AND CENTRAL VALLEY. CURRENT RADAR IMAGERY SHOWS THAT THIS ACTIVITY EXTENDS
ALL THE WAY DOWN INTO LOUISIANA AND IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE MOVING
ACROSS OUR AREA OVERNIGHT AND THROUGH TOMORROW. ABUNDANT MOISTURE
ALONG WITH A 35 TO 45 KNOT 850MB JET WILL HELP TO SUPPORT POSSIBLE
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. THE BULK OF THE PRECIP LOOKS TO OCCUR
BETWEEN THE 00 UTC AND 12 UTC HOUR WHERE AMOUNTS FROM ONE AND A
HALF INCHES UP TO 2 INCHES OF RAIN ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS A FEW
LOCATIONS. MOST AREAS WILL SEE ONE TO ONE AND A HALF INCHES OF RAINFALL.
OVERNIGHT MINS WONT FLUCTUATE MUCH FROM THE CURRENT TEMPS AS DENSE
CLOUD COVER AND LOW LEVEL WAA WILL NOT ALLOW TEMPS TO DROP MUCH IF
ANY OVERNIGHT. THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A RUMBLE OF THUNDER OR
TWO AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AS THERE WILL BE SOME
ELEVATED INSTABILITY PRESENT.

RAIN CONTINUES TOMORROW BUT SHOULD BEGIN TO TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO 
EAST THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS. TEMPS WILL BE A  DEGREE OR TWO 
WARMER TOMORROW.  



.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE PATTERN 
WILL BE NOTED THROUGH THE EXTENDED AS THE CURRENT WESTERN H5 TROF 
MOVES TO THE EASTERN U.S. EARLY IN THE PERIOD. RESULTING WEATHER 
WILL BE WARM SECTOR PRECIP EVENT AS THE WESTERN TROUGH APPROACHES TN 
AND TAPS GULF MOISTURE. FOLLOWING...FAIR WEATHER AND COOL TEMPS WILL 
OCCUR FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK. BUT IF YOU LIKE WET 
WEEKENDS THEN TAKE HEART FOR ANOTHER ONE IS SHAPING UP...AS A NEW 
WESTERN TROUGH WILL MOVE OUT OF THE ROCKIES INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
AND TAP INTO THE GULF ONCE AGAIN...SPREADING RAIN ACROSS THE AREA FOR 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

NRN AL AND NRN GA. SURFACE ANALYSIS FROM 06Z TO 08Z...PLUS MODEL
FORECAST SOUNDINGS...SEEM TO PIN DOWN THE AREAS FOR A BRIEF PERIOD
OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET TO SCOTT COUNTY TN AND WISE COUNTY
VA. CALLS MADE TO ADJACENT COUNTIES ALONG NRN PLATEAU INTO LEE
COUNTY VA REVEALED A CHILLY LIGHT RAIN OR NO PCPN AT ALL. WISE
COUNTY DISPATCH REPORTED A LIGHT ICY RAIN IN COEBURN WITH ROADS
WEST TO KY LINE GETTING A BIT OF ICING. THIS ALL FITS WELL WITH OUR
CURRENT FREEZING RAIN ADVISORY WHICH WILL RUN THROUGH 7AM EST.

WILL RUN A PRE FIRST PERIOD FOR FORECAST AS THE WINTRY PCPN LOOKS TO 
END IN OUR AREA BY 12Z TODAY...TRANSITIONING TO ALL RAIN AS LOW 
LEVEL WARM AIR ADVECTION WORKS N-NE. MAX TEMPS TRICKY AND ARE 
DEPENDENT ON HOW FAR NE THE WARM FRONT REACHES. CLOUDS AND RAIN LED 
ME TO UNDERCUT GFS MOS MAXES...WHICH ALSO MESHED BETTER WITH 
ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. WENT AT LEAST CLOSER TO MOS BLEND FOR MAXES SW 
OF PROGGED WARM FRONT LOCATION...AND ALSO FOR TRI WHERE DOWNSLOPING 
E TO SE WINDS OCCUR.

NOT A LOT TO SAY ABOUT TONIGHT...EXCEPT THAT THE RAIN SHOULD 
CONTINUE. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS 
ALTHOUGH SOUNDINGS ARE COOL IN THE LOW LEVELS AND WARM ALOFT...NOT 
EXACTLY SUPPORTIVE OF TSRA. THIS LIMITS INSTABILITY TO ELEVATED TO 
MY THINKING. QUITE MILD FOR MIN TEMPS TONIGHT WITH GFS OR BLEND 
CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...RAIN CONTINUES MONDAY AS
FRONT DRAPED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MOVES SLOWLY EAST. CONTINUED
WARMING TEMPERATURES BUT WITH RAINFALL HIGHS STILL ONLY CLIMB TO
THE UPPER 40S TO THE LOWER 50S. RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD BE HEAVY
DURING THE MORNING HOURS EASTERN AREAS THEN SHIFT EAST OUT OF THE
REGION AFTER 18Z AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES NORTHEAST ALONG THE FRONT.
THE RAIN DECREASES LATE MONDAY AND EARLY MONDAY NIGHT BEFORE MODELS
DEVELOP ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TO THE SW WITH MORE PRECIPITATION MOVING
ACROSS THE EASTERN TN VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. WITH CLOUD
COVER AND RAIN TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLOW TO FALL MONDAY NIGHT WITH
LOWS TUESDAY MORNING MOSTLY IN THE MID TO UPPER 30S. PARTS OF THE
PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MAY REACH THE LOWER 30S. AS
ATMOSPHERE COOLS ALOFT THERE MAY BE SOME SLEET MONDAY NIGHT AND
SNOW BUT LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION. EARLY TUESDAY RAIN CHANGES TO

ELEVATIONS AND IN THE MORNING BEFORE ATMOSPHERE BEGINS TO DRY OUT
AND TEMPERATURES BECOME TO WARM. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN TUESDAY
NIGHT AND CONTINUES A DRY PATTERN OVER THE REGION THROUGH THURSDAY
NIGHT. NEXT SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER TEXAS FRIDAY THEN TREKS EAST INTO
THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND TN VALLEY FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. LOWS
FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE IN THE 30S AND SOME SNOW COULD MIX IN
INITIALLY BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN. THIS SYSTEM WILL MOVE MAINLY

MOVE IN FROM SOUTH TO NORTH LATE TONIGHT.  CONFIDENCE IS HIGH THAT 
LOCATIONS GENERALLY AROUND AND SOUTH OF I40 WILL REMAIN ABOVE 
FREEZING FOR ALL RAIN.  FURTHER NORTH SOME LOCATIONS WILL FALL TO OR 
BELOW FREEZING...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...THE NORTHEAST TN MOUNTAINS AND PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA.  
THESE LOCATIONS COULD SEE POCKETS OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN...THOUGH 
MOST OF THESE AREAS WILL RECEIVE A TRACE TO A COUPLE HUNDREDTHS.  
HOWEVER...WISE COUNTY VA AND SCOTT COUNTY TN COULD SEE AROUND A 
TENTH OF AN INCH OF ICE ACCUMULATIONS AND A FREEZING RAIN ADVISORY 
IS IN EFFECT OVERNIGHT FOR THOSE LOCATIONS.  ALL ON TRACK IN THE 
CURRENT FORECAST...WILL UPDATE ZONE PACKAGE TO REMOVE EVENING 
WORDING.

352 PM EST SAT DEC 7 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT)...ANOTHER ROUND OF PRECIP BEGINS TO MOVE IN 
OVER NIGHT WITH THE RETURN OF GULF MOISTURE. THE MAJORITY OF OUR 
AREA WILL SEE LIQUID PRECIP DUE TO STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION AT 850MB 
AND ABOVE FREEZING SURFACE TEMPS. MOST AREAS COULD RECEIVE UP TO ONE 
QUARTER OF AN INCH OF RAIN BY 12 UTC TOMORROW MORNING. PRECIP BEGINS 
TO MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN AREAS AROUND 06 UTC AND UP INTO NETN AND 
SWVA BETWEEN 09 AND 12 UTC. IT LOOKS AS IF THERE COULD BE SOME 
TROUBLE SPOTS FURTHER NORTH IN REGARDS TO LIGHT FREEZING RAIN AND 
MINOR ICE ACCUMULATIONS. THE MAIN AREAS OF CONCERN APPEAR TO BE 
SCOTT COUNTY TN AND WISE COUNTY VA WHICH ARE UNDER A FREEZING RAIN 
ADVISORY BEGINNING AT 06 UTC AND LASTING THROUGH 12 UTC TOMORROW MORNING. 
CURRENT MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT THESE AREAS WILL STAY COLD 
ENOUGH TO POSSIBLY RECEIVE UP TO ONE TENTH OF AN INCH OF ICE 
ACCUMULATION BEFORE SWITCHING OVER TO ALL RAIN TOMORROW MORNING. 
OTHER AREAS NOT IN THE ADVISORY...INCLUDING THE REST OF THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU...SWVA AND EXTREME NETN...WILL LIKELY SEE A BRIEF PERIOD OF 
LIGHT FREEZING RAIN BEFORE SWITCHING OVER TO ALL RAIN BUT ICE 
ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO ONLY BE A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH IF 
ANY DUE TO SURFACE TEMPS CLIMBING ABOVE FREEZING QUICKER THAN SCOTT 
AND WISE. 

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...PICKING UP THE FORECAST AFTER 
WINTRY THREAT HAS WANED SUNDAY MORNING.  SHOULD BE LONG DURATION OF 
RAIN.  ANY FLOODING DURING THIS PERIOD SHOULD BE LIMITED.  EXPECTED 
AMOUNTS ARE ONLY BETWEEN 1-2 INCHES IN THE SUNDAY/MONDAY TIMEFRAME 
WITH INCH EAST AND 2 INCHES WESTERN AREAS.  HOWEVER...THE OVERALL 
4-5 DAY TOTALS MAY CAUSE SOME MINOR FLOODING OF LARGER 
STREAMS...RIVERS...AND OTHER FLOOD-PRONE LOW-LYING AREAS.

AFTER MIDNIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT ELEVATED INSTABILITY COMES STREAMING OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA.  LOOKS LIKE A SLIGHT THREAT OF SOME 
THUNDER MONDAY BETWEEN 06Z AND 15Z.  WILL PLAN ON THE SOUTHERN 2 
TIERS OF COUNTIES TO HAVE THUNDER INCLUDED.

THE WINDS WILL PICK UP SUNDAY AS THE RETURN FLOW SETS UP.  NOT A 
GOOD ORIENTATION OF THE WIND OVERALL FOR A MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT.  
BEST WINDS ABOUT 15Z WITH SOME DOWNSLOPING...BUT THEN WINDS VEER FOR 
THE AFTERNOON AND GET ALIGNED WITH THE RIDGELINE ALONG THE TN/NC 
BORDER.  FOR NOW WILL NOT ISSUE ANY ADVISORY. 

ON TUESDAY COLDER AIR WILL BE PUSHING INTO THE AREA...FOR SNOW 
ACCUMULATION...PUTTING IN A COUPLE OF TENTHS FOR TUESDAY AFTERNOON 
IN THE NW SECTIONS...ALSO MAY HAVE SOME ACCUMULATION TUESDAY NIGHT 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN 1/3 OF THE AREA...WITH THE LAST WAVE OF 
MOISTURE/LIFT.  THIS IS JUST BEYOND THE CURRENT SNOW AMOUNT FORECAST 
GRIDS...BUT GENERALLY THINK IT WOULD BE LESS THAN 1 INCH.  THIS IS 
MOSTLY SYNOPTIC MID LEVEL LIFT RATHER THAN UPSLOPE OF LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE...SO NOT EXPECTING MOUNTAINS TO GET MUCH ENHANCEMENT.

AFTER ALL THE PRECIPITATION FINALLY MOVES OUT OF THE AREA...IT 
SHOULD TURN DRY FOR 2-3 DAYS.  GOING A FEW DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE 
FOR THIS DRY PERIOD.  THEN TOWARD THE WEEKEND THE NEXT SYSTEM IN THE 
GULF WILL MAKE A RUN TOWARD THE AREA...ALTHOUGH THE LATER MODEL RUNS 
ARE TRACKING THIS SYSTEM FARTHER SOUTH.  ALSO HAVE KEPT ALL THE 
PRECIP WITH THIS SYSTEM LIQUID FOR NOW.

1020 AM EST SAT DEC 7 2013

.DISCUSSION...THE CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. SURFACE OBS INDICATE 
ALL AREAS HAVE CHANGED TO RAIN AT THIS POINT EXCEPT FOR ISOLATED 
SPOTS ACROSS WISE COUNTY VA. WISE COUNTY MAY STILL SEE A WINTER MIX 
OVER THE NEXT HOUR OR SO AS WELL AS A FEW SLICK ROADWAYS BEFORE 
CHANGING OVER TO ALL RAIN. ALL AREAS WILL SEE RAIN TODAY AS A MEAN 
SW FLOW WILL KEEP GULF MOISTURE STREAMING INTO OUR AREA. 
HOWEVER...THE HEAVIEST RAINS LOOK LIKE THEY WILL CONTINUE TO STAY 
WEST OF I-75 AND I-80 WHICH WILL ALLOW THESE AREAS TO POTENTIALLY 
PICK UP BETWEEN ONE HALF AND THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH OF RAIN WITH 
LOCALIZED HIGHER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE. AREAS TO THE EAST OF I-75 AND 
I-80 WILL LIKELY SEE LESSER AMOUNTS BETWEEN ONE QUARTER AND UP TO 
ONE HALF INCH. DENSE CLOUD COVER WILL REMAIN THE REST OF THE DAY BUT 
DOWNSLOPING WINDS MAY ALLOW FOR SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS ALONG THE 
FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS ACROSS COCKE...GREENE...AND WASHINGTON 
COUNTY TN. LOW LEVEL WAA WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HELPING 
TO RAISE TEMPS INTO THE MID TO UPPER 40S ACROSS THE EXTREME SOUTHERN 
AREAS...MID 40S IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY...LOWER TO MID 40S FOR NE 
TN...AND NEAR 40 TO LOWER 40S FOR SWVA. NO UPDATES PLANNED AT THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THANKFULL TO SEE THE MAIN AREA
OF RAIN MOVING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING. MAY SEE SOME
LINGERING PATCHY LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE THIS MORNING...AND I
INCLUDED A MENTION OF LIGHT FREEZING DRIZZLE IN THE COLDEST SPOTS
OF NRN AREAS SUCH AS NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA.

ENJOY THIS BRIEF BREAK IN WET WEATHER TODAY AS GULF MOISTURE QUICKLY 
RETURNS TONIGHT. VERY GOOD AGREEMENT IN TIMING THIS NEXT ROUND OF 
WET WEATHER AMONGST MOST MODELS...WITH RAIN REACHING WELL INTO SRN 
1/2 OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 06Z SUNDAY...THEN ONTO REMAINDER OF NRN 
AREAS BEFORE 12Z SUNDAY. THE WARM AIR ADVECTION IS STRONG WITH 850 
MB TEMPS WARMING IN THE SMOKIES TO 8 TO 10 DEGS CELSIUS BY 12Z 
SUNDAY. MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A CHANCE...JUST A CHANCE...
OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET LATE TONIGHT ACROSS NRN MOST 
COUNTIES OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SW VA AND POSSIBLY ERN MOST 
PARTS OF JOHNSON AND CARTER COUNTIES IN FAR NE TN. 

OTHERWISE...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES MADE TO MAX/MIN TEMP GRIDS AS GFS 
MOS LOOKED GOOD FOR TODAY. I DID NUDGE MIN TEMPS UP JUST A BIT 
ACROSS SRN AREAS FOR TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...RAIN INCREASES AGAIN SUNDAY
THROUGH MONDAY AS SURFACE LOW NORTH OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO THE
SOUTH CONTINUES TO BRING MOISTURE OVER IT. FIRST WAVE OF RAIN MOVES
THROUGH SUNDAY THEN ANOTHER SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS AND MOVES
NORTHEAST INTO THE TN VALLEY MONDAY FOR EVEN MORE RAIN...POSSIBLY
HEAVY. NAM MODEL THEN BRINGS A THIRD LOW PRESSURE AREA NORTHEAST
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH THE LOW PASSING ALONG THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN CREST JUST SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH SYSTEM
FINALLY EXITING THE REGION BY TUESDAY EVENING. GFS LESS AGGRESSIVE
WITH THE LAST PART OF THE SYSTEM AND HAS LAST LOW FARTHER SOUTH IN
GEORGIA MOVING NE INTO THE CAROLINAS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.THIS
SCENARIO WOULD MEAN LESS RAIN AFFECTING THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT AND
TUESDAY AND COLDER TEMPERATURES. TEMPERATURES WARM INTO THE 40S MONDAY
THEN ONLY COOL A FEW DEGREES SUNDAY NIGHT. WARMER TEMPERATURES
MONDAY BEFORE COLD AIR MOVES SOUTHEAST LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND
TUESDAY. RAIN CHANGES TO SNOW LATE MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY MORNING
MAINLY PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. TEMPERATURES MONDAY NIGHT
ONLY DROPPING A COUPLE DEGREES BELOW FREEZING PLATEAU AND PART OF
SW VA SO ONLY LIGHT ACCUMULATION AMOUNTS EXPECTED. HIGHS TUESDAY
MID 30S HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO MID 40S SOUTH. RIVER FLOODING MAY BE A
CONCERN BY MONDAY OR TUESDAY DUE TO THE PROLONGED RAINFALL EVENT
THAT BEGINS AGAIN LATE TONIGHT. RAINFALL AMOUNTS FROM EARLY SUNDAY
TO TUESDAY HOWEVER LOOK TO BE MOSTLY 2 TO 3 INCHES ON AVERAGE.
HIGH PRESSURE TAKES HOLD TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT BUT
NEW SYSTEM APPROACHES FRIDAY WITH CHANCE OF RAIN SOUTHWEST SECTIONS
LATE IN THE DAY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG COLD FRONT ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH MUCH COLDER AIR MOVING 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. IN FACT...FREEZING TEMPS HAVE PUSHED INTO 
SOUTHEAST KY...AND WERE NEARING THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND 
CUMBERLAND MTN RANGE. PHONE CALLS TO DISPATCHES IN WISE COUNTY VA 
AND SCOTT COUNTY TN INDICATE RAIN IN THESE COUNTIES WITH NO ROAD 
PROBLEMS. AREA RADARS REVEAL THE BACK EDGE OF THE RAIN APPROACHING 
THESE AREAS...SO THESE AREAS MAY BE ABLE TO ESCAPE THE POSSIBILITY 
OF FREEZING RAIN AND ICING PROBLEMS TONIGHT...BUT WILL NEED TO 
CONTINUE MONITORING FOR ANY CHANGES. OTHERWISE...RAIN SHOULD 
GRADUALLY DECREASE IN COVERAGE OVERNIGHT...AS COLDER AIR SLOWLY 
FILTERS INTO THE FORECAST AREA.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...CORRECTION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
347 PM EST FRI DEC 6 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SHALLOW COLD FRONT HAS HUGGED 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING. STRONG LOW LEVEL INVERSION 
FROM 1400-3000 FEET WEST OF THE COLD FRONT. THIS FEATURE IS 
TRAPPING STRATUS CLOUDS ACROSS THE EAST TN VALLEY TODAY. TAIL END OF 
STRENGTHENING UPPER JET WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE TN VALLEY 
TONIGHT. RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF JET WILL ENHANCE LIFT AND AID IN 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELEVATED CONVECTION BETWEEN FRONT AND UPPER JET. 
BEST CHANCES FOR CONVECTION WILL BE BETWEEN 9PM AND 1 AM. MOST AREAS 
SHOULD SEE AN ADDITIONAL INCH OF RAINFALL. COLDER AIR BEGINS 
FILTERING IN OVERNIGHT. SOME MIXED PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY OCCUR 
ON BACK SIDE OF PRECIPITATION. RELATIVELY HIGH FREEZING LEVEL WILL 
DROP DOWN TO AROUND 1500 FEET BY DAY BREAK. AREAS ALONG THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND PORTIONS OF NE TN MAY 
SEE SOME LIGHT ICE ACCRETION PRIMARILY ALONG TREE LIMBS AND POWER 
LINES. CONDITIONS SHOULD CLEAR OUT BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH SOME 
HIGH CLOUDINESS IN UPPER SW FLOW. TONIGHT TEMPERATURE WILL BE NEAR 
STEADY OR FALL SLOWLY WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES IN THE SATURDAY 
MORNING HOURS. AFTERNOON HIGHS WILL REMAIN COOL...MAINLY IN THE 
40S.  

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...STILL LOOKING TO THIS 
NEXT SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND WILL 
CONTINUE WITH PRECIPITATION THROUGH MONDAY...THEN START TO TAPER OFF.

THERE ARE SEVERAL CONCERNS/ITEMS OF INTEREST....WILL BREAK THEM DOWN 
HERE...

1...WILL THERE BE ANY FREEZING PRECIP ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THIS 
SYSTEM SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE PRECIPITATION OVERSPREADS A COLD/COOL 
AIR MASS?  ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS...THINK THAT MOST FAVORED AREAS ARE IN 
THE NORTHWARD DRAINING BASINS...NORTHERN CAMPBELL AND SCOTT COUNTIES 
IN TN...AROUND THE TOWN OF THE JELLICO...AND NORTHERN WISE COUNTY IN 
VA...WHERE NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS WILL TRAP COLD AIR IN THESE 
VALLEYS.  RIGHT NOW LOOKS LIKE LITTLE IF ANY IMPACT...AND FOR IMPACT 
IT WOULD BE VERY LOCALIZED.

2...WILL THERE BE FLOODING RAINS DURING THIS LONG 
DURATION...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY?  ANY FLOODING DURING THIS 
PERIOD SHOULD BE LIMITED.  EXPECTED AMOUNTS ARE ONLY BETWEEN 1-2 
INCHES...1 INCH EAST AND 2 INCHES WESTERN AREAS...AND THIS IS SPREAD 
OVER A PERIOD OF TWO DAYS.  HOWEVER...THE OVERALL 4-5 DAY TOTALS MAY 
CAUSE SOME MINOR FLOODING OF LARGER STREAMS...RIVERS...AND OTHER 
FLOOD-PRONE LOW-LYING AREAS.

3...WILL THERE BE A MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WIND EVENT SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT?  RIGHT NOW...THIS LOOKS TO BE A VERY MINIMAL WIND EVENT.  THE 
WINDS ARE NOT OVERLY STRONG AND ALSO ALIGN PRETTY QUICKLY WITH THE 
SPINE OF THE MOUNTAINS...WHEREAS IN GOOD WIND EVENTS...THE WINDS ARE 
FROM THE SOUTH OR SOUTHEAST CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS.

4...WILL THERE BE THUNDER DURING THE WARM ADVECTION PHASE SUNDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY?  LOOKS LIKE MOST OF THE THUNDER WILL STAY SOUTH OF 
THE AREA...WILL NOT MENTION THUNDER IN THE FORECASTS FOR SUNDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY.

5...WILL THE BACK SIDE OF ALL THIS PRECIP HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL WINTRY 
PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY?  RAIN SHOWERS WILL BE 
TURNING TO SNOW SHOWERS AS THE COLDER AIR MOVES IN.  THERE IS A 
LITTLE MORE MOISTURE IN THE FLOW THAT COULD ENHANCE THE POSSIBILITY 
OF A MEASURABLE SNOW...ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY...STILL A LITTLE EARLY TO DEFINE THIS.

6...HOW COLD WILL THE TEMPERATURES BE NEXT WEEK?  LOOKS PRETTY 
COLD...BUT NOT AS COLD AS IT DID IN YESTERDAYS MODELS.

7...WHEN THE NEXT SYSTEM COMES IN FOR LATE NEXT WEEK...WILL THERE BE 
ANY WINTRY PRECIPITATION?  WHEN THIS SYSTEM COMES IN...THE MODELS 
AGREE THAT THE WARMER AIR AND MOISTURE WILL COME INTO THE AREA 
TOGETHER...THEREBY MINIMIZING THE CHANCES FOR WINTER PRECIPITATION.

THE DEVELOPMENT OF ELEVATED CONVECTION BETWEEN FRONT AND UPPER JET. 
BEST CHANCES FOR CONVECTION WILL BE BETWEEN 9PM AND 1 AM. MOST AREAS 
SHOULD SEE AN ADDITIONAL INCH OF RAINFALL. COLDER AIR BEGINS 
FILTERING IN OVERNIGHT. SOME MIXED PRECIPITATION WILL LIKELY OCCUR 
ON BACK SIDE OF PRECIPITATION. RELATIVELY HIGH FREEZING LEVEL WILL 
DROP DOWN TO AROUND 1500 FEET BY DAY BREAK. AREAS ALONG THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND PORTIONS OF NE TN MAY 
SEE SOME LIGHT ICE ACCRETION PRIMARILY ALONG TREE LIMBS AND POWER 
LINES. CONDITIONS SHOULD CLEAR OUT BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON WITH SOME 
HIGH CLOUDINESS IN UPPER SW FLOW. TONIGHT TEMPERATURE WILL BE NEAR 
STEADY OR FALL SLOWLY WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES IN THE SATURDAY 
MORNING HOURS. AFTERNOON HIGHS WILL REMAIN COOL...MAINLY IN THE 
40S.  

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...STILL LOOKING TO THIS 
NEXT SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND WILL 
CONTINUE WITH PRECIPITATION THROUGH MONDAY...THEN START TO TAPER OFF.

THERE ARE SEVERAL CONCERNS/ITEMS OF INTEREST....WILL BREAK THEM DOWN 
HERE...

1...WILL THERE BE ANY FREEZING PRECIP ON THE FRONT SIDE OF THIS 
SYSTEM SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE PRECIPITATION OVERSPREADS A COLD/COOL 
AIR MASS?  ONLY SMALL AMOUNTS...THINK THAT MOST FAVORED AREAS ARE IN 
THE NORTHWARD DRAINING BASINS...NORTHERN CAMPBELL AND SCOTT COUNTIES 
IN TN...AROUND THE TOWN OF THE JELLICO...AND NORTHERN WISE COUNTY IN 
VA...WHERE NORTHEAST SURFACE WINDS WILL TRAP COLD AIR IN THESE 
VALLEYS.  RIGHT NOW LOOKS LIKE LITTLE IF ANY IMPACT...AND FOR IMPACT 
IT WOULD BE VERY LOCALIZED.

2...WILL THERE BE FLOODING RAINS DURING THIS LONG 
DURATION...SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY?  ANY FLOODING DURING THIS 
PERIOD SHOULD BE LIMITED.  EXPECTED AMOUNTS ARE ONLY BETWEEN 1-2 
INCHES...1 INCH EAST AND 2 INCHES WESTERN AREAS...AND THIS IS SPREAD 
OVER A PERIOD OF TWO DAYS.  HOWEVER...THE OVERALL 4-5 DAY TOTALS MAY 
CAUSE SOME MINOR FLOODING OF LARGER STREAMS...RIVERS...AND OTHER 
FLOOD-PRONE LOW-LYING AREAS.

3...WILL THERE BE A MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WIND EVENT SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT?  RIGHT NOW...THIS LOOKS TO BE A VERY MINIMAL WIND EVENT.  THE 
WINDS ARE NOT OVERLY STRONG AND ALSO ALIGN PRETTY QUICKLY WITH THE 
SPINE OF THE MOUNTAINS...WHEREAS IN GOOD WIND EVENTS...THE WINDS ARE 
FROM THE SOUTH OR SOUTHEAST CROSSING THE MOUNTAINS.

4...WILL THERE BE THUNDER DURING THE WARM ADVECTION PHASE SUNDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY?  LOOKS LIKE MOST OF THE THUNDER WILL STAY SOUTH OF 
THE AREA...WILL NOT MENTION THUNDER IN THE FORECASTS FOR SUNDAY 
THROUGH MONDAY.

5...WILL THE BACK SIDE OF ALL THIS PRECIP HAVE ANY MEANINGFUL WINTRY 
PRECIPITATION ON MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY?  RAIN SHOWERS WILL BE 
TURNING TO SNOW SHOWERS AS THE COLDER AIR MOVES IN.  THERE IS A 
LITTLE MORE MOISTURE IN THE FLOW THAT COULD ENHANCE THE POSSIBILITY 
OF A MEASURABLE SNOW...ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINS FOR LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY...STILL A LITTLE EARLY TO DEFINE THIS.

6...HOW COLD WILL THE TEMPERATURES BE NEXT WEEK?  LOOKS PRETTY 
COLD...BUT NOT AS COLD AS IT DID IN YESTERDAYS MODELS.

7...WHEN THE NEXT SYSTEM COMES IN FOR LATE NEXT WEEK...WILL THERE BE 
ANY WINTRY PRECIPITATION?  WHEN THIS SYSTEM COMES IN...THE MODELS 
AGREE THAT THE WARMER AIR AND MOISTURE WILL COME INTO THE AREA 
TOGETHER...THEREBY MINIMIZING THE CHANCES FOR WINTER PRECIPITATION.






THERE ARE TWO ISSUES WITH THIS NEXT WAVE OF PRECIPITATION...FIRST IS 
THE THREAT FOR ANY FREEZING/FROZEN PRECIPITATION THROUGH ABOUT 15Z 
SUNDAY...WHEN THE WARMER AIR SHOULD WIN-OUT...AND THE SECOND ISSUE 
IS HOW HEAVY THE RAIN WILL GET.

THE PATTERN PRETTY MUCH STAYS UNSETTLED FOR THE FIRST 3 DAYS OF THIS 
PERIOD...UNTIL THE TROUGH AXIS FINALLY CLEARS THE AREA...ROUGHLY 
LATE TUESDAY.  SO FROM 00Z WED THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST WILL 
KEEP IT DRY.

GETTING BACK TO SATURDAY NIGHT...LOOKS LIKE MOST OF THE AREA WILL 
JUST GET A COLD RAIN...BUT CONCERNED ABOUT NORTHWESTERN AREAS THAT 
WILL HAVE UPSLOPE NORTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW...SUCH AS JELLICO AND 
ONEIDA...THAT THE COLD AIR MASS MAY BE LOCKED INTO PLACE LONGER AND 
THERE WILL BE A BETTER CHANCE OF FREEZING RAIN...BUT ONLY EXPECTING 
A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF ACCRUAL...SO AT THIS TIME...NOT ANTICIPATING 
MANY PROBLEMS.  ALSO AM MENTIONING PARTS OF WISE AND RUSSELL VA
COUNTIES FOR LIGHT FREEZING RAIN...BUT PRECIP SHOULD BE LIGHTER 
THERE OVERNIGHT.

FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...PRECIP SHOULD BE RAIN...THEN AS 
COLD AIR RETURNS ON TUESDAY...WILL LIKELY HAVE SOME SNOW SHOWERS ON 
THE BACK END OF THE SYSTEM.

IN THE SECOND WAVE OF PRECIP...FROM SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
SUNDAY...WE HAVE PRECIP OF ABOUT 1/2 INCH TO AN INCH ACROSS THE 
AREA.  THERE WILL BE MORE RAIN ON MONDAY...THAT WILL BE ADDRESSED IN 
FUTURE FORECASTS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD FRONT APPEARS TO BE 
EASING SE INTO THE NE PLATEAU AND CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES THIS 
MORNING. RAINFALL HAS BEEN VERY SPARSE IN COVERAGE AND GENERALLY 
LIGHT IN AMOUNT SO FAR OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...HAVE TO AGREE WITH 
SHOWERS INCREASING DURING THE MORNING AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES A BIT 
FURTHER EAST...THEN STALLS ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EAST TN INTO 
WRN NC. PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED RIGHT ON TRACK...AND I 
INCLUDED THE MENTIONS OF ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS AS BEFORE. POTENTIAL 
TRAINING OF SHOWERS ALONG THE FRONT...WITH HPC 6 HOURLY QPF 
FOLLOWED. WILL CONTINUE THE MENTION OF HEAVY RAINS IN THE HAZARDOUS 
WEATHER OUTLOOK AND GRAPHICAST.

THE STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND A SURFACE LOW TRACKING ALONG THE 
BOUNDARY WILL SUPPORT CATEGORICAL POPS AGAIN TONIGHT, HOWEVER...
THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD END RATHER ABRUPTLY SATURDAY MORNING. NO 
SIGNIFICANT THREAT OF ANY WINTRY TYPE ACCUMULATIONS...AND PREVIOUS 
POP AND WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED VERY GOOD. 

MAX TEMPS VERY CHALLENGING FOR TODAY WITH THE VERY MILD NAM MOS 
MAXES DISCARDED IN FAVOR OF THE MORE SENSIBLE/COOLER GFS MOS MAXES. 
A BLEND OF SIMILAR MOS MINS WAS CHOSEN FOR TONIGHT...AND AGAIN ON 
SATURDAY MAXES...WITH SURFACE RIDGE MOVING OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST 
STATES AND A COOL N TO NE LOW LEVEL FLOW INTO THE LOCAL REGION.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...FRONTAL SYSTEM
JUST TO THE SOUTH DEVELOPS WAVE OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND
NORTHERN GULF SATURDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY. SURFACE LOW MOVES NE
INTO THE TN VALLEY SUNDAY WITH DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. COLD AIR
IN PLACE INITIALLY COULD LEAD TO SOME BRIEF FREEZING RAIN NORTHERN
PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA BEFORE WARMING LATER SATURDAY NIGHT
AND EARLY SUNDAY. ICE ACCUMULATION AMOUNTS WILL BE VERY LIGHT AND
MAINLY NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WITH TEMPERATURES
WARMING ABOVE FREEZING BY MID MORNING. RAINFALL AMOUNTS COULD REACH
UP TO ABOUT 2 INCHES FROM EARLY SUNDAY TO EARLY MONDAY. ANOTHER ONE
HALF TO ONE INCH POSSIBLE MONDAY BEFORE FRONTAL SYSTEM FINALLY
SHIFTS SOUTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT. AS COLD AIR
MOVES IN BEHIND FRONT MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING SOME LIGHT
SNOW SHOWERS MAY PRODUCE LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS. COLD HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDS IN TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. LOWS WILL BE IN THE 20S
AND HIGHS IN THE MID 30S TO MID 40S WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

258 AM EST THU DEC 5 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL VERY SLOWLY 
APPROACHED THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FROM THE WEST DURING THE 
SHORT TERM.  AHEAD OF THE FRONT...A SEASONALLY WARM AND VERY MOIST 
AIR MASS IS IN PLACE.  SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP AND MOVE 
INTO THE AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON.  THE AIR MASS DOES BECOME WEAKLY 
UNSTABLE AND COULD SEE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP OVER THE AREA.  WITH A 
STRONG WIND FIELD ALOFT...A STRAY STORM COULD GENERATE STRONG GUSTY 
WINDS.  BY TONIGHT...THE FRONT WILL STILL BE TO OUR WEST...BUT A 
LARGE BAND OF CONVECTION WILL PUSH IN FOR LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN 
DECENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL PATTERN...ALTHOUGH STILL SOME 
DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS. TWO ROUNDS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY 
PRECIPITATION EXPECTED...AS DEEP MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW FEEDS PLENTY 
OF MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. THE COLD FRONT OVER THE AREA FRIDAY WILL 
EXIT FRIDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING FOR A BRIEF DRIER PERIOD ON SATURDAY.  
THEN MOISTURE WILL SURGE BACK IN SATURDAY NIGHT AS A WAVE OF LOW 
PRESSURE FORMS ON THE FRONT...WITH THE RAIN CONTINUING INTO MONDAY. 
TOTAL RAINFALL AMOUNTS BY LATE FRIDAY NIGHT WILL LIKELY BE IN EXCESS 
OF 2 INCHES OVER PARTS OF THE AREA ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND WEST ZONES 
WITH THE FIRST ROUND OF PRECIP...THEN ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAIN WITH THE 
SECOND ROUND WILL INCREASE THE THREAT OF FLOODING. THIS THREAT WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE MENTIONED IN THE HWO.   

WHILE MOST OF THE PRECIP SHOULD BE RAIN...THE COLDER AIR MOVING IN 
MAY CHANGE THE PRECIP OVER TO A LITTLE LIGHT SLEET OR FREEZING RAIN 
ACROSS PARTS OF THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA BEFORE ENDING LATE FRIDAY NIGHT/EARLY SATURDAY.  
ALSO AS THE PRECIP MOVES BACK IN SATURDAY NIGHT THERE MAY BE A 
LITTLE LIGHT SLEET/FREEZING RAIN/SNOW ON THE FRONT EDGE OF THE 
PRECIP IN THESE SAME AREAS BEFORE IT ALL CHANGES TO RAIN. AT THIS 
POINT THE THREAT FOR SIGNIFICANT WINTER PRECIP APPEARS TO BE 
LOW...SO FOR NOW WILL JUST INCLUDE SOME SLEET MENTION IN THE 
FORECAST IN THESE AREAS AND CONTINUE TO MENTION IN THE HWO.   

DRIER AND COLDER AIR WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT.  RAIN SHOWERS EXPECTED TO 
TRANSITION TO SOME SNOW SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT. MAY BE SOME LINGERING  
SNOW SHOWERS ESPECIALLY MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST TUESDAY. DRY 
WEDNESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT 
OVER SOUTHERN WV AND WESTERN VA...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND 
MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE ZONAL
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WILL BECOME 
MORE SOUTHWESTERLY OVERNIGHT...WITH SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY HELPING TO GENERATE PATCHY LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE... 
MAINLY OVER SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC AFTER MIDNIGHT.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THIS EVENING TO REMOVE SOME EVENING PRECIP 
WORDING AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE BASED ON CURRENT TRENDS.

.AVIATION...TRIED A GO SLOW APPROACH TO THE FORECAST WITH UPPER
LEVEL WINDS REMAINING SOUTHWESTERLY. IN THIS CONFIGURATION THE
ARCTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY CURRENTLY NEARING THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY WILL MOVE VERY SLOWLY EAST. NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF AN MVFR
CATEGORY CLOUD LAYER AROUND EARLY THIS EVENING AND IT MAY TAKE
SEVERAL HOURS FOR THIS LAYER TO DEVELOP SO KEPT CEILINGS VFR FOR
TONIGHT WITH ONLY SOME LIGHT FOG POSSIBLE AT CHA AND TRI FROM AROUND
07-08Z THROUGH 14Z. MOISTURE AND LIFT INCREASE DURING THE DAY AHEAD
OF THE FRONT WHICH MAKES IT ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY THE END
OF THE FORECAST. APPLIED AN MVFR VSBY REDUCTION IN LIGHT RAIN
SHOWERS AT CHA AT 19Z AND TRENDED TOWARD (BUT JUST ABOVE) MVFR AT
TYS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON. WITH A DOWNSLOPE FLOW CONTINUING AT TRI
WOULD NOT EXPECT TOO MUCH RAIN HERE UNTIL THE EARLY EVENING HOURS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA 
SHIFTS EAST TONIGHT AS SHORT WAVE MOVES NORTHEAST THROUGH THE TN 
VALLEY ON THURSDAY. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST THROUGH MIDDLE TN 
ON THURSDAY. WARM AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES WITH SOUTHWESTERLY LOW 
LEVEL FLOW. TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL IN PREFRONTAL AIRMASS. 
DRY MID LEVELS MOISTEN UP ON THURSDAY. EXPECT EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. FORECAST PROBLEM IS PRECIPITATION COVERAGE. 
UNDERCUT BLENDED MOS POP GUIDANCE BY HALF FOR THURSDAY DUE TO LACK 
OF GOOD TRIGGER. BEST CHANCE APPEAR TO BE ACROSS SW NC AND THE 
PLATEAU WHERE LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND UPSLOPE FLOW MAY AID 
CONVECTIVE INITIATION. THUNDERSTORMS BECOME POSSIBLE BY THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON. STORM MOTION WILL BE TO THE NE NEAR 45 MPH. DEEPER 
CONVECTION SHOULD STAY WEST OF THE AREA UNTIL LATE IN THE PERIOD. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
UNSETTLED WEATHER WILL DOMINATE THE END OF THE WEEK AND BEGINNING OF 
THE NEW WEEK AS A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL IMPACT THE 
REGION...BRINGING SEVERAL ROUNDS OF PRECIPITATION AND THE POTENTIAL 
FOR SOME LOCALIZED FLOODING. MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT OF 
SHOWING A BROAD AREA OF SHOWERS BEGINNING TO MOVE INTO THE REGION 
ALONG/AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT MOVING IN FROM THE WEST. WITH DEEP 
MOISTURE AVAILABLE...WIDESPREAD SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED LATE THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...BEFORE THINGS BEGIN TAPER OFF LATE FRIDAY NIGHT 
INTO SATURDAY. THE CONCENTRATION OF THE HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION WILL 
LIKELY BE TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE REGION...BUT A WIDESPREAD 
SOLID 1 TO 2 INCHES...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS CERTAINLY SEEMS 
POSSIBLE THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING. WITH A BOUNDARY DRAPED ACROSS THE 
REGION ON FRIDAY AND SOME MODEST INSTABILITY...SOME ISOLATED STRONG 
THUNDERSTORMS MAY ALSO BE POSSIBLE DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT...SOME COLDER AIR WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE REGION MAY 
ALSO HELP TO CHANGE OVER SOME WINING PRECIPITATION OVER THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU TO SLEET. HOWEVER...DID NOT THINK THAT TEMPERATURES WILL 
COOL ENOUGH BEFORE THE PRECIPITATION EXITS TO MAKE A MENTION OF THIS 
ATTM. 

AFTER A BRIEF BREAK IN THE PRECIPITATION DURING THE DAY SATURDAY... 
THE AFOREMENTIONED BOUNDARY WILL LIFT BACK UP TO THE NORTH AS A WARM 
FRONT...AND BRING IN SOME DEEP GULF MOISTURE FROM THE SOUTH. THIS 
WILL TRIGGER OFF ANOTHER ROUND OF LOCALLY HEAVY SHOWERS SATURDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY AS DEEP UPPER-TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH THE AREA. 
THE PROLONGED RAINFALL ACROSS THE REGION MAY BRING AN ADDITIONAL 1 
TO 3 INCHES AND CAUSE A THREAT FOR FLOODING DUE TO THE ALREADY 
SATURATED GROUND AND THE HIGHER CREEKS/STREAMS. A STRONG PUSH OF 
COLDER AIR WILL THEN MOVE IN MONDAY NIGHT...CHANGING OVER THE 
LINGERING SHOWERS ON THE BACKSIDE OF THIS SYSTEM TO SNOW SHOWERS AS 
THE SYSTEM WINDS DOWN. THEREAFTER...DRY AND COLD AIR WILL LINGER 
ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO
BE IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL PATTERN...ALTHOUGH SOME
DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS. WILL BE IN FOR A PERIOD OF UNSETTLED
WEATHER FOR THE PERIOD...AS MUCH OF THE PERIOD WILL BE DOMINATED BY
DEEP AND MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. A SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT WILL
MOVE INTO THE REGION EARLY ON...AND WILL PUSH THROUGH BEFORE MOVING
BACK NORTH AS A WARM FRONT AS LOW PRESSURE FORMS ON THE FRONT
SATURDAY NIGHT AND ADVANCES TOWARD THE AREA ON SUNDAY. WITH PLENTY

FAIRLY STRONG VEERING WIND PROFILE ALSO EXPECTED. A FEW STRONG TO 
SEVERE STORMS CANNOT BE RULED OUT THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION THIS THREAT IN HWO. 

MODELS STILL INDICATE A TEMPORARY BREAK FROM THE MORE SIGNIFICANT 
RAIN ON SATURDAY...AS COLDER AIR TEMPORARILY MOVES INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA. WITH THE SHALLOW COLD AIR MOVING IN...SOME SUBFREEZING AIR MAY 
MAKE IT INTO PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND PERHAPS WESTERN 
PORTIONS OF OUR SW VA COUNTIES...WHICH COULD LEAD TO SOME FREEZING 
RAIN OR SLEET AS THE PRECIP SURGES BACK IN SATURDAY NIGHT.  
HOWEVER...AT THIS POINT IT APPEARS MORE LIKELY TO STAY ABOVE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...ANOTHER MOSTLY CLOUDY DAY OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. PERSISTENT LOW LEVEL SOUTHEAST FLOW OVER 
THE PLATEAU COUNTIES...SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA AND SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT KEPT SKIES CLOUDY AND TEMPERATURES 
ONLY IN THE LOWER TO MID 50S. FARTHER NORTH A BREAK IN THE CLOUDS 
FROM LATE MORNING THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON IN NORTHEAST SECTIONS 
ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO REACH TO THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. CLOUDS 
WERE MOVING BACK INTO NORTHEAST SECTIONS AS WEAK SHORTWAVE IS MOVING 
INTO THAT REGION LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. LIFT IS WEAK 
SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY RAIN. FOR TONIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY WITH LOW 
LEVEL SOUTHEAST FLOW AND ALREADY SATURATED ATMOSPHERE AND WEAK 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING THROUGH BEST CHANCE OF RAIN OR DRIZZLE 
ALTHOUGH SLIGHT WILL BE ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC. A WEAK WARM FRONT 
WILL MOVE NORTH OVERNIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY AS LOW PRESSURE 
DEVELOPS OUT AHEAD OF DISTINCT ARCTIC FRONT OVER THE WESTERN STATES. 
PATCHY FOG WILL FORM AS WELL ESPECIALLY SOUTH...AND LOCALLY DENSE. 

THE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE TO THE EAST WILL STRENGTHEN AND BRING WARMER 
AIR NORTH WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL CHANGE LITTLE OVERNIGHT IN 
THE SOUTH NEAR WARM FRONT. LOWS NEAR 50 SOUTH AND MID TO UPPER 40S 
ELSEWHERE. EXPECT SOME CLEARING AGAIN NORTHEAST HALF WEDNESDAY LIKE 
TODAY BUT MOSTLY CLOUDY SOUTH. HIGHS SHOULD REACH THE MID 60S TO 
NEAR 70 SOME 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL AND ABOVE TODAY AS A 
STRONGER SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS BEHIND THE WARM FRONT AND AS 
PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS AHEAD OF LOWER PRESSURE IN THE PLAINS 
STATES.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND REVEAL A DEEP AND PERSISTENT SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW 
DEVELOPING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY THURSDAY AND LINGERING 
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. IN FACT...IT APPEARS THIS SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW WILL EMANATE FROM THE EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN...RESULTING IN A 
DEEPER MOISTURE FETCH WHICH COULD CREATE MORE RAIN THAN THE MODELS 
CURRENTLY SUGGEST. THIS UPPER-LEVEL SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL BECOME 
PARALLEL TO A SLOW-MOVING ARCTIC COLD FRONT OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY...SO IT APPEARS THAT A PROLONGED RAINFALL EVENT WILL DEVELOP 
FOR SEVERAL DAYS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FROM THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT. RIGHT NOW...WIDESPREAD RAINFALL TOTALS OF TWO TO FIVE INCHES 
APPEAR POSSIBLE BY MONDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. WHILE IT APPEARS THAT FLASH 
FLOODING FROM THUNDERSTORMS WILL NOT BE A PROBLEM...THE PROLONGED 
NATURE OF THIS RAINFALL WILL LIKELY EVENTUALLY LEAD TO WIDESPREAD 
FLOODING OF RIVERS AND STREAMS (AND OTHER LOW LYING AND FLOOD PRONE 
AREAS).

ON THURSDAY...MODELS INDICATE SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY DEVELOPING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT...WITH A 
FAIRLY STRONG VEERING WIND PROFILE ALSO EXPECTED. THUS...IT APPEARS 
THAT A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL BEING THE 
MAIN THREATS.

MODELS STILL INDICATE A TEMPORARY BREAK FROM THE RAIN ON SATURDAY... 
AS COLDER AIR TEMPORARILY MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. ECMWF MODEL 
STILL INDICATES THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SUB-FREEZING LOW-LEVEL AIR 
MOVING ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AFTER MIDNIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT... 
WHICH COULD CREATE SOME SLEET OR FREEZING RAIN WITH ICING CONCERNS. 
THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUN STILL KEEPS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ABOVE 
FREEZING EARLY SATURDAY MORNING...SO WILL JUST MENTION RAIN FOR 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING...BUT WILL MENTION THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SLEET OR FREEZING RAIN IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL THEN TREND COOLER THEREAFTER...WHICH 
IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

OVER THE AREA...WITH LOW LEVEL FLOW FROM THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST.  
LOW CLOUDS...ALONG WITH SOME LIGHT SHOWERS/SPRINKLES CAN BE EXPECTED 
ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND CENTRAL. FLOW MAY BECOME A BIT MORE DOWNSLOPE 
FOR A PERIOD NORTH WHICH MAY HELP TO BREAK UP THE CLOUDS LATER TODAY 
INTO FIRST PART OF TONIGHT. WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTH INTO

.LONG TERM(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...WILL BE IN A WET AND UNSETTLE 
WEATHER PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED.  AN EXITING SHORT WAVE WITH 
STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW AND WIDESPREAD ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL PROVIDE 
ISOLATED CONVECTION AND UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE

CONTINUE TO PULL IN ABUNDANT DEEP MOISTURE AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING 
COLD FRONT.  THE FRONT WILL STALL OR SLOWLY SIGNIFICANTLY TO OUR

AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  WHILE SOME BREAK IN THE RAIN AREA 
EXPECTED...MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN SHOWERS WILL MOVE THROUGH FOR

WILL PUSH TROUGH AROUND THE FRIDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME PROVIDING A 
BRIEF BREAK IN SHOWERS ON SATURDAY.  THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL THEN 
LIFT BACK INTO THE AREA AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM REDEVELOPS SUNDAY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STILL TRAPPED 
ACROSS FORECAST AREA WITH CLOUDY SKIES AND A FEW SPRINKLES. AREAS OF 
DRIZZLE AND SOME FOG STILL ONGOING ESPECIALLY SOUTH VALLEY AND 
PLATEAU. TEMPERATURES HAVE CHANGED LITTLE ACROSS CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS AFTER LOWS IN THE LOWER TO MID 40S HAVE ONLY 
WARMED TO THE MID TO UPPER 40S. WARMEST TEMPERATURES ACROSS NE TN 
AND SW VA WHERE TEMPERATURES NEAR 50 AT MID AFTERNOON. ONLY A FEW 
BREAKS HAVE BEEN SEEN IN CLOUD COVER. THE BREAKS HAVE BEEN ACROSS
THE NE TN MOUNTAINS AND SW VA. A WEAK SHORTWAVE OVER MAINLY NORTHERN 
AL WAS MOVING SE TOWARD GA AT THIS TIME. SE TN AND SW NC WILL BE ON 
THE NORTHERN SIDE OF THIS FEATURE WITH SOME LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE 
POSSIBLE NEXT SEVERAL HOURS. A SERIES OF WEAK SHORTWAVES MOVING FROM 
WEST OR NORTHWEST TO EAST SOUTHEAST WILL OCCUR OVER THE NEXT 24 
HOURS KEEPING SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY SOUTH WITH SOME CLEARING NORTH AND 
SLIGHT CHANCES OF LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE MAINLY SOUTH THROUGH 
TUESDAY. LOWS TONIGHT WILL ONLY DROP A FEW DEGREES CENTRAL AND SOUTH 
AND MORE IN THE NE WHERE PARTIAL CLEARING COULD TAKE PLACE. TUESDAY 
LIGHT SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST WIND FLOW AND SOME CLEARING AT TIMES...MORE 
THAN TODAY...SHOULD WARM TEMPERATURES 10 DEGREES ABOVE TODAYS...INTO 
THE MID 50S HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO AS WARM AS MID 60S VALLEYS.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND REVEAL A DEEP SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW DEVELOPING OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY BY THE END OF THE WEEK. BEFORE THEN...A WARM AIR 
ADVECTION PATTERN WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA...RESULTING IN 
UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPS AND SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE REGION. 
THIS ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL CREATE EXTENSIVE CLOUDINESS AND THE 
POSSIBILITY OF AN ISOLATED SHOWER THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BY 
THURSDAY...THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME SOUTHWESTERLY OVER MOST 
OF THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE NATION....WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A DEEP 
MOISTURE FETCH EMANATING FROM THE EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN. THIS UPPER- 
LEVEL FLOW WILL ALSO BECOME PARALLEL TO A SLOW-MOVING FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...SO IT APPEARS THAT A PROLONGED 
HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT COULD DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. WHILE THERE MAY BE A TEMPORARY 
BREAK FROM THIS HEAVY RAIN WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
ON SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS 
REVEAL A SIMILAR PATTERN DEVELOPING AGAIN FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS 
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY DRIFTS BACK NORTHWARD INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
AND A DEEP SOUTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW REDEVELOPS. THUS...IT 
APPEARS THAT A VERY WET PATTERN (WITH A GOOD POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING) 
WILL LINGER FOR SEVERAL DAYS OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

ANOTHER CONCERN BY FRIDAY NIGHT WILL BE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME 
SUB-FREEZING LOW-LEVEL AIR MOVING ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AFTER 
MIDNIGHT FRIDAY NIGHT...WHICH COULD CREATE SOME FREEZING RAIN AND 
ICING CONCERNS. THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUN HAS TRENDED TOWARD A WARMER 
SCENARIO FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...SO FOR NOW...WILL JUST MENTION RAIN FOR 
FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING...BUT A FREEZING RAIN POSSIBILITY 
WILL NEED TO BE MONITORED IN LATER FORECASTS. AS FOR TEMPS..WILL 
GENERALLY TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE END OF 
THE WEEK...AND WILL THEN TREND COOLER THEREAFTER...WHICH IS IN 
BETTER LINE WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT WITH WEAK WARM AIR ADVECTION AND OROGRAPHICS 
POSSIBLY CREATING SOME LIGHT RAIN ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. WARM/MOIST 
ADVECTION INCREASES WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AS MAJOR UPPER TROUGH 
BECOMES ESTABLISHED ACROSS THE WESTERN U.S. PACIFIC MOISTURE WILL 
STREAM INTO THE REGION AS THE GRADIENT IN PRESSURE BETWEEN THE 
TROUGH AND A PERSISTENT RIDGE OVER THE GULF OF MEXICO TIGHTENS. IN 
THE LOWER LEVELS MOISTURE WILL BE BE TAPPED OFF THE GULF. THE 
DEEPENING MOIST COLUMN WILL ENCOUNTER A VERY SLOW MOVING FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY SEPARATING MODIFIED ARCTIC AIR FROM A MILD SUB-TROPICAL 
AIRMASS. PERIODS OF MODERATE TO HEAVY RAIN CAN BE EXPECTED THURSDAY 
INTO FRIDAY AS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAKES ITS WAY SLOWLY SOUTH 
THROUGH THE REGION. DROPPED POPS OFF INCREMENTALLY FROM NORTHWEST TO 
SOUTHEAST ON SATURDAY AS THE COLD FRONT FINALLY SLIPS ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS INTO THE CAROLINAS. KEPT SOME WINTER PRECIPITATION OVER 
PART OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE WEEKEND WITH MOISTURE 
OVERRUNNING THE CHILLY AIRMASS IN THE PREVAILING SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT. WENT CLOSER TO THE ECM NUMBERS FOR MAX AND MIN TEMPS. IT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
CLOUDS OVER MIDDLE TN THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE MOVING INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE WEST THROUGH THE EVENING. MOISTURE IS CONFINED TO A
SHALLOW LAYER...BELOW 700 MB. SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT SKIRTS OUR
SOUTHERN COUNTIES AFTER MIDNIGHT...AND THE NAM/GFS PRODUCE SOME
LIGHT QPF IN THAT AREA LATE TONIGHT AND INTO MONDAY. WILL HAVE A
SLIGHT CHANCE POP SOUTH. THE NAM SPREADS PRECIP INTO NORTHERN
SECTIONS AROUND 12Z...BUT THIS SEEMS OVERDONE AND WILL GO CLOSER TO
THE GFS. THIS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LINGERS OVER THE ENTIRE AREA
THROUGH MONDAY...KEEPING CLOUDY SKIES IN PLACE...ALTHOUGH LIFT
REMAINS VERY WEAK AND ONLY IN SOUTHERN AREAS. ALTHOUGH THERE IS
SOME WEAK 850 MB WARM ADVECTION TOMORROW...WILL LEAN ON THE COOL
SIDE OF MOS TEMPS DUE TO EXPECTED CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH THE LONGER TERM WILL PROVIDE
SEVERAL CHANCES FOR RAIN. MODELS STILL IN DISAGREEMENT ON PRECIP
CHANCES AND AMOUNT FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED. WILL CONTINUE THE
TREND TOWARD THE DRIER GFS SOLUTION.

SOUTHERLY FLOW AT 850MB BEGINS TO DEVELOP MONDAY NIGHT WHILE A WEAK 
WAVE OF ENERGY MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. LIFT AND MOISTURE HOWEVER 
APPEAR TO BE LACKING...WILL KEEP MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN 
OVERNIGHT MONDAY EXCEPT FOR EXTREME SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SW NC WHERE 
CHANCE POPS WILL BE IN PLACE. ANY PRECIP THAT OCCURS WILL LIKELY BE IN 
THE FORM OF LIGHT SHOWERS OR DRIZZLE. THE WAVE IS OFF TO OUR EAST BY 
TUESDAY...BUT ANOTHER SYSTEM IS BEGINNING TO TAKE SHAPE ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS. MODELS SHOW A SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING SOMEWHERE 
ALONG THE FRONT RANGE ON TUESDAY WITH AN ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT THAT 
WILL BE BACK TO OUR SOUTHWEST THAT WILL BEGIN TO APPROACH OUR AREA. 
MODELS WANT TO BRING IN LIGHT PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH WARM FRONTAL 
OVERRUNNING...BUT DEEP MOISTURE AND LIFT APPEAR TO BE LACKING 
ACCORDING TO GFS WHILE THE NAM IS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH PRECIP. WILL 
KEEP JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT PRECIP IN FOR TUESDAY FROM 
KNOXVILLE SOUTH AND ALONG THE PLATEAU. KEPT POPS OUT FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT.

850MB SOUTHERLY FLOW CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING PLAINS SYSTEM. BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING THE WARM FRONT IS TO OUR NORTH ACROSS INDIANA AND 
ILLINOIS...WHICH APPEARS TO BE TOO FAR TO OUR NORTHWEST TO PROVIDE 
ANY SUBSTANTIAL LIFT OVER OUR AREA AS WE SHOULD BE WELL IN THE WARM 
SECTOR AT THIS POINT. WILL LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE 
PLATEAU AND FROM KNOXVILLE SOUTH BUT DRY FURTHER EAST. BY WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE PLAINS SYSTEM IS JUST OFF 
TO OUR WEST AND SHOULD BEGIN TO ENTER OUR AREA BY THE THURSDAY 
MORNING/AFTERNOON TIME FRAME. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A 
THUNDERSTORM IN FOR THURSDAY AS TEMPS WILL BE IN THE 60S AND 
DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S AHEAD OF THE FRONT. 

A MORE INTERESTING STORY DEVELOPS ALONG THE STALLED OUT COLD 
FRONT...A LARGE DEEPENING TROUGH ACROSS THE WESTERN US WILL SHIFT 
THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS INTO A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WEDNESDAY INTO 
THURSDAY ALONG WITH A SUBSTANTIAL UPPER LEVEL JET THAT WILL MOVE 
INTO OUR AREA FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED. STRONG SW FLOW WILL TAP 
INTO GULF MOISTURE AND BEGIN TO INCREASE PWS. GFS SOUNDINGS SHOW PWS 
OF AT LEAST ONE INCH FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY 
MORNING...TOPPING OUT AT 1.4 TO 1.5 INCHES ON THURSDAY WHICH PUTS US 
IN THE 99TH PERCENTILE BASED ON THE PW CLIMATOLOGY FOR EARLY 
DECEMBER. IT APPEARS THAT A PROLONGED PERIOD OF HEAVY RAINFALL IS 
POSSIBLE ACROSS OUR AREA DURING THE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY 
TIME FRAME IF THIS SETUP DOES INDEED TAKE PLACE. THIS IS SOMETHING 
THAT WILL HAVE TO BE MONITORED CLOSELY WITH FUTURE MODEL RUNS. THE 
GFS SHOWS A BREAK IN THE RAIN SHOWERS ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON BEFORE 
MORE POSSIBLE RAIN COMES IN FOR SUNDAY. A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS 
ARENT OUT OF THE QUESTION SATURDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE DEEP 
TROUGH BRINGS IN COLDER AIR BEHIND THE DEPARTED COLD FRONT.

TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO WARM THROUGH THE EXTENDED AND WILL MAX 
OUT THURSDAY AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH TEMPS IN THE MID 60S AND WILL 
BEGIN TO DROP ON FRIDAY BEHIND THE FRONT WITH HIGHS IN THE 40S OVER 
THE WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION WILL 
WEAKEN AS A WEAK SHORT WAVE APPROACHES DURING THE SHORT TERM.  SOME 
HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE AREA TO START TODAY...BUT MOISTURE WILL 
INCREASE LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH AN INCREASE IN LOWER CLOUDS.  
MOISTURE LOOKS TO BE RATHER SHALLOW AND FORCING WILL BE WEAK. 
APPEARS BEST CHANCE FOR SOME LIGHT RAIN WILL BE SOUTH...SO WILL 
INCLUDE SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS THERE. WILL GO DRY 
REMAINDER OF THE AREA.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL 
STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS STRUGGLING WITH AN 
INITIAL PERIOD OF UNSETTLED WEATHER EARLY IN THE LONG TERM AND ARE 
NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT WITH TIMING CONCERNING THE LATE WEEK 
SYSTEM. MODELS DEPICT PASSAGE OF A FEW RIPPLES OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. 
THE WAVES ARE RATHER WEAK WITH SOMEWHAT LIMITED AVAILABLE MOISTURE. 
THERE IS A LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY WITH PROBABILITY OF PRECIP WITH THE 
EARLY WEEK PERIOD SO KEPT A REDUCED CHANCE OF RAIN WITH THIS LOW 
PROBABILITY EVENT. HOPEFULLY LATER MODEL RUNS RESOLVE THESE INITIAL 
WAVES. UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS GRADUALLY RISE ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES 
BY MID WEEK AS A TROUGH TAKES UP RESIDENCE OUT WEST...AMPLIFYING AS 
IT DOES SO. INCREASING WARM AND MOIST ADVECTION DEVELOPS OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH ENOUGH MOISTURE AND LIFT IN PLACE ACROSS 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER ON WEDNESDAY. 
POPS CRANK UP INTO THE LOW TO MEDIUM CHANCE RANGE WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
INTO THURSDAY AS A RIVER OF DEEP MOISTURE BUILDS EAST TOWARD THE 
APPALACHIAN REGION. ADDED SOME THUNDER TO THE MIX ON THURSDAY WITH 
MODELS PROGGING SOME WEAK INSTABILITY. A SHARP COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
EDGES STEADILY EAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH LATER THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY ENHANCING LIFT. LIKELY POPS WERE APPLIED MAINLY FRIDAY INTO 
FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE BOUNDARY MOVES ONLY SLOWLY EAST. STAYED CLOSER 
TO THE SLOWER EUROPEAN MODEL CONCERNING FRONTAL TIMING HERE. WAS 
ABLE TO LOWER POPS BACK TO CHANCE CATEGORY SATURDAY WHILE DROPPING 
ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. MUCH OF THE LONG

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...UPPER LEVEL ZONAL FLOW WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM LEADING TO A QUIET WEATHER PATTERN. 
SURFACE RIDGING BEGINS TO MOVE OFF TO OUR EAST OVERNIGHT WHICH WILL 
ALLOW FOR SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW. IN RESPONSE TO SOUTHERLY 
FLOW...MODEL SOUNDINGS WANT TO INCREASE LOW LEVEL 925MB MOISTURE AND 
INCREASE CLOUD COVER OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY AT CHA AND SPREADING UP 
TOWARD TYS. THE BULK OF THE CLOUD COVER SHOULD STAY SOUTH OF 
KNOXVILLE. CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO DECREASE LATE TOMORROW MORNING BUT 
WILL STILL KEEP SOME CLOUDS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS. HIGH TEMPS 
TOMORROW WILL BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER BUT STILL A FEW DEGREES 
BELOW NORMALS.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS 
EAST SUNDAY NIGHT AND WEAK SHORTWAVE AND FRONT MOVES INTO TN VALLEY 
MONDAY. THERE NOW LOOKS LIKE ENOUGH MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT FOR 
SOME LIGHT RAIN SOUTHERN SECTIONS. INCREASED POPS TO 40 PERCENT 
SOUTH BUT LEFT NORTH AT 20 PERCENT. MODELS SHOW WEAK RIDGING TO DRY 
ATMOSPHERE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AS DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE 
WESTERN STATES FORMS STRONGER STORM. CANADIAN AND GFS SHOW DEEPENING 
SURFACE LOW OVER THE PLAINS TO MOVE NORTHEAST INTO SOUTHEAST CANADA 
BY LATE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH MOISTURE INCREASE OVER 
FORECAST AREA AND A FEW SHOWERS SPREADING IN LATE WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BUT ECMWF IS MUCH SLOWER AND FARTHER WEST WITH DEEP 
LOW MOVING INTO CANADA THURSDAY AS TROUGH DIGS EVEN DEEPER INTO THE 
DESERT SOUTHWEST. THAT COULD MEAN DRY CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT GFS HAS FRONT MOVE 
ACROSS TN WITH HIGHEST POPS JUST AHEAD AND ALONG FRONT. ECMWF MOVING 
FRONT MUCH SLOWER WITH FRONT NOT APPROACHING EAST TN UNTIL THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND ONLY SLOWLY CROSS THE REGION FRIDAY. ECMWF SHOWS MORE 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY FOLLOWING THE FRONT WITH MORE SHOWERS FRIDAY NIGHT 
INTO SATURDAY. FOLLOWED THE SLOWER SOLUTION WITH HIGHEST CHANCES 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES ABOVE FREEZING SUNDAY NIGHT 
AND WARMING TO THE 50S MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND LOWER 60S POSSIBLE

UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN ZONAL ACROSS THE NATION TODAY AND
TONIGHT WITH SOME CI/CS MOVING THROUGH TENNESSEE VALLEY. SURFACE
RIDGING WILL CONTINUE TODAY...BUT WILL MOVE EAST OF THE SOUTHERN

LAYER MOISTURE FROM SOUTH TO NORTHEAST TONIGHT ALONG WITH
ISENTROPIC LIFT. WILL INCREASE CLOUD COVER TONIGHT.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE PERIOD STARTS OUT DRY WITH 
SOME SUNSHINE ON SUNDAY. HOWEVER...SHORT WAVE ENERGY BUILDS INTO THE 
EASTERN STATES MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. SUFFICIENT MOISTURE ALONG WITH 
SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT MAY ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME LIGHT 
RAIN ACROSS THE AREA DURING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST. A MORE 
AMPLIFIED SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE EASTERN STATES LATER IN THE 
WEEK. A NICE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION FOR WEDNESDAY 
PROVIDING SUNSHINE AND MILDER TEMPERATURES. THE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
ALOFT STRENGTHENS WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AS A SLOW MOVING UPPER 
TROUGH EDGES VERY SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE WESTERN U.S. THE SYSTEM 
MOVES SO SLOWLY THAT I TRIED TO ONLY GRADUALLY RAISE POPS WITH A 
RELATIVE POP MIN IN THE DOWNSLOPE REGION OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. BY THURSDAY 
NIGHT...INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION AND LIFT AHEAD OF THE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
312 AM EST WED NOV 27 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTO-GENETIC BAND WILL MOVE
ACROSS THE AREA EARLY THIS MORNING WITH SNOW ENDING OVER MUCH OF
THE AREA BY 10 AM OR EARLIER. CURRENT REPORTS SHOW MODERATE SNOW
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA WITH SOME ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE GRASSY
SURFACES. WILL CONTINUE WITH THE SNOW ADVISORIES FOR THE CENTRAL
VALLEY..PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA THROUGH 10 AM AND
NORTHEAST SECTIONS UNTIL 1 PM. 

NAM AND GFS CONTINUE TO SHOW A PERIOD OF NORTHWEST FLOW OROGRAPHIC
LIFT INTO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR
EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. HOWEVER...DURATION IS MUCH LESS THAN
PREVIOUS RUNS...SO HAVE REDUCED SNOW ACCUMULATIONS AND WILL END
WARNING AT 4 PM. HOWEVER..NAM DOES SHOW SOME BOUNDARY LAYER
INSTABILITY OVER SOUTHEAST KENTUCKY/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THIS
AFTERNOON WHICH WILL HELP KEEP SNOW SHOWERS GOING FOR WISE COUNTY..
VIRGINIA.

WILL LIKELY ISSUE AN UPDATE BEFORE 8 AM AS SNOW ENDS ACROSS THE AREA.

AS FOR CLOUDS...LATEST SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF LOW-
LEVEL DRY AIR JUST WEST AND NORTHWEST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
WHICH WILL ADVECT INTO THE AREA TODAY. THE DRY AIR WILL HELP ERODE
THE LOW-CLOUDS FAIRLY QUICKLY TODAY FROM WEST TO EAST.

FOR TONIGHT...BESIDES A FEW LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS OVER FAR
NORTHERN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND A CHANCE OF FLURRIES OVER THE
NORTHEAST THIRD OF THE AREA...SKIES WILL BE CLEARING WITH COLD
TEMPERATURES FOR THANKSGIVING MORNING.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS SHOW A ZONAL UPPER- 
LEVEL FLOW PATTERN DEVELOPING ON THANKSGIVING AND LINGERING THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND...WHICH WILL RESULT IN DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS FOR 
THE FORECAST AREA. A WARMING TREND WILL ALSO DEVELOP THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...AS SOUTHERLY WINDS DEVELOP OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON THE 
BACK SIDE OF AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE NORTHEAST. 
MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY... 
RESULTING IN SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY 
TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

.DISCUSSION...COLDER AIR STARTING TO MOVE BACK IN...AND PRECIP
INCREASING LAST HOUR. STILL EXPECT A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW
OVERNIGHT...AND SOME SNOW ACCUMULATION POSSIBLE BY MORNING.
THINK PRECIP AMOUNTS MAY BE A BIT LIGHTER THAN CURRENT FORECAST AND

LOWER SNOW AMOUNTS ACROSS THE AREA. HOWEVER...PLAN TO LEAVE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
254 PM EST TUE NOV 26 2013

.SHORT TERM....SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
TROUGH/UPPER LOW AND THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES/UPPER MIDWEST UPPER 
TROUGH EDGING A LITTLE CLOSER TO PHASING LATE TONIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY. AT MID AFTERNOON LARGE AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN 
PRESSING GRADUALLY NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
THE WIDESPREAD HEAVIER RAIN WILL LARGELY DIMINISH THROUGH THE 
EVENING HOURS WHILE THE FORECAST AREA AWAITS THE SUB-FREEZING AIR 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE NORTHERN STREAM SYSTEM. SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT 
THE RAIN WILL BE CHANGING TO SNOW IN THE HIGHER CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
TERRAIN...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER. BY 3 AM EST...ENOUGH COLD AIR WILL BE STREAMING 
EAST ACROSS THE REGION FOR MUCH OF THE PRECIPITATION TO CHANGE OVER 
TO LIGHT SNOW. ADJUSTED THE WINTER STORM WATCH TO A WARNING FOR THE 
AFTERNOON FORECAST ISSUANCE. BASICALLY KEPT THE SAME WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORY FROM THE PREVIOUS ISSUANCE...ALTHOUGH ADDED EXTREME 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AS WELL AS CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES IN NORTH 
CAROLINA. ALSO...I TRUNCATED THE TIMING OF THE ADVISORY EVENT BACK 
TO 18Z WEDNESDAY AS MODEL FORECASTS AGREE THAT THE DEEPEST MOISTURE 
AND LIFT SHIFT EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS TIME. MORE THAN 
SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND UPSLOPE FLOW WILL LIKELY KEEP THE SNOW 
FLYING ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE 
MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY 
EVENING. SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION FOR MUCH OF THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE FROM AROUND 2 OR 3 AM EST TO AROUND 10 AM 
EST. THE BEST CHANCE FOR ACCUMULATING SNOW WILL BE ON GRASSY 
SURFACES IN THE GREAT VALLEY WHERE TEMPERATURES WILL ONLY COOL A 
DEGREE OR TWO BELOW FREEZING LATE TONIGHT. IN MUCH OF THE ADVISORY 
AREA SNOWFALL WILL ACCUMULATE TO AROUND 1 TO 2 INCHES MAINLY ON THE 
GRASS. FARTHER SOUTH AROUND CHATTANOOGA ACCUMULATION SHOULD BE LESS 
THAN AN INCH. THE HIGHER TERRAIN (IN THE WINTER STORM WARNING) COULD 
SEE AMOUNTS CLOSER TO 2 TO 4 INCHES WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS ON 
THE ORDER OF 4 TO 8 INCHES. ADDING DISCOMFORT TO THE LATE NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY PERIOD WILL BE A GUSTY NORTH TO NORTHWEST WIND.  


.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS A BIT
INCONSISTENT ABOUT TIMING OF THE SNOWFALL EXITING THE AREA. BY
WEDNESDAY NIGHT UPSLOPE FLOW DOMINATES THE FORCING FOR SNOW
ACCUMULATION...MAINLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. INCLUDED A SLIGHT
CHANCE FOR LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS IN THESE AREAS UNTIL LATE WEDNESDAY
NIGHT. WINDS WILL BECOME GUSTY AS THE LOW PRESSURE MOVES UP THE
EAST COAST. WIND CHILL VALUES COULD EASILY REACH THE TEENS THURSDAY
MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE THEN SETTLES OVER THE AREA FOR THURSDAY
THROUGH SUNDAY...WITH DRY CONDITIONS AND A WARMING TREND PRESENT
THROUGH THIS TIME. TEMPERATURES WILL APPROACH NORMAL FOR THIS TIME
OF YEAR. NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN MOVES INTO THE AREA MONDAY MORNING
THROUGH MID DAY TUESDAY. RAIN LOOKS LIKE THE MAIN CONCERN WITH THIS
SYSTEM.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED NEAR THE MOUTH OF THE MS 
RIVER...WITH ALMOST ALL OF THE OBSERVATIONS IN THE FORECAST AREA 
REPORTING RAIN WITH ABOVE FREEZING TEMPS. THERE MAY STILL BE SOME 
POCKETS OF FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET IN A FEW VALLEYS...BUT THESE 
FREEZING POCKETS SHOULD DISAPPEAR BY SUNRISE AS A STRONG WARM AIR 
ADVECTION PATTERN CONTINUES OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT THAT ONE TO THREE INCHES OF RAIN WILL FALL OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA BY THIS EVENING...WITH THE HIGHEST AMOUNTS EXPECTED 
OVER THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST NC. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL 
THEN MOVE INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...AS AN 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME SLEET DEVELOPING LATE 
TONIGHT DURING THE TRANSITION FROM RAIN TO SNOW...DUE TO A WARM 750 
MB LAYER THAT STAYS ABOVE FREEZING FOR A FEW HOURS AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A DEFORMATION ZONE WILL 
DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT...BEFORE NORTHWESTERLY

MOISTURE TO MOVE BACK INTO THE REGION WITH SKY BECOMING MOSTLY 
CLOUDY AREA-WIDE. ANOTHER SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE MOVES ACROSS 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY PRODUCING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS. AT THIS TIME...ANTICIPATE 
MAINLY RAIN FROM THIS SYSTEM.

TENNESSEE VALLEY AT MID EVENING WITH PRECIPITATION BEGINNING TO
FALL THE PAST FEW HOURS OVER SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU AND THE CENTRAL VALLEY. THE PRECIPITATION WAS ADVANCING
NORTHEAST INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS WELL AT THIS HOUR.
TEMPERATURES RANGED FROM THE LOWER 40S IN SW NC TO THE LOWER 30S ON
THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE MOUNTAINS OF SW VA. DEW
POINTS ARE IN THE TEENS IN THE PRECIPITATION FREE AREAS TO 20S
WHERE PRECIPITATION HAS STARTED. SOME SLEET...SNOW AND LIGHT
FREEZING RAIN HAS BEEN REPORTED ON THE PLATEAU AND THE EAST CENTRAL
VALLEY AND INTO SW VA. WET BULB COOLING HAS ALLOWED A FEW PLACES ON
THE PLATEAU AND ALONG THE NORTHERN TN BORDER INTO SW VA TO DROP
BELOW FREEZING. EXPECT THIS AREA TO WARM ABOVE FREEZING DURING THE
NEXT FEW HOURS. IF THIS AREA STAYS BELOW FREEZING MAY HAVE TO
ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. THE AREA

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...WIDESPREAD CLOUDS COVER THE
STATE OF TENNESSEE...SOUTHWEST VA AND SOUTHWEST NC. SURFACE
DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS TO MIDDLE TEENS ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA. WILL EXPERIENCE VERY LIGHT RAIN FIRST FROM
CHATTANOOGA WEST EARLY THIS EVENING. EXPECT THIS AREA OF
PRECIPITATION TO SPREAD NORTHEASTWARD. WITH THE LOW DEWPOINTS AM
SLIGHTLY CONCERNED THAT WETBULB COOLING WILL OCCUR FOR A LITTLE
LONGER THAN CURRENT FORECAST SUGGESTS PARTICULARLY OVER THE
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND PORTIONS OF SW VA. ANTICIPATING THE
FREEZING RAIN BEGINNING AROUND 10 OR 11PM FOR AN HOUR OR TWO BEFORE
CHANGING OVER TO RAIN. THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE NORTHWARD INTO SW
VA TOWARD SUNRISE...BEFORE CHANGING TO ALL LIQUID AS THE LOWER
LEVELS WARM ABOVE FREEZING.

ON TUESDAY...PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN WILL OCCUR ESPECIALLY ALONG AND 
EAST OF I-75. AT THIS TIME THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL WILL BE 2.5 TO 2.75 
INCHES ACROSS SW NC AND SE TN. EXPECT THE RAINFALL TO LESSEN IN 
INTENSITY BY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON TUESDAY.


.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...LOW PRESSURE WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHEAST...WITH PRECIP IN FORECAST THROUGH
WEDNESDAY EVENING. TUESDAY NIGHT...SOUNDINGS ACROSS THE AREA SHOW
ABOVE FREEZING TEMPERATURES FROM SFC TO MIDLEVELS THROUGH 00Z.
COLD AIR WILL QUICKLY ADVECT INTO THE AREA FROM THE
NORTHWEST...TAKING THE ENTIRE SOUNDING TO BELOW ZERO TEMPERATURES.
DURING THIS TIME THE TEMPERATURE DROPS QUICKLY ENOUGH... SO EXPECT
ANY RAIN TO TRANSITION FULLY TO SNOW. ANY SLEET WILL BE VERY SHORT
LIVED...SO LEFT OUT OF FORECAST. NORTHERN PLATEAU COULD SEE THIS
TRANSITION FIRST BETWEEN 9 PM AND 11 PM...WITH THE REST OF THE
PLATEAU AND VALLEY BETWEEN 10 PM AND 12 AM. SHORTLY AFTER
MIDNIGHT...EXPECT THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA TO DROP BELOW FREEZING
WITH SNOW AS THE MAIN EVENT.

THE SOUNDING IS VERY MOIST THROUGH UPPER MID LEVELS THROUGH
THE EARLY MORNING. AMOUNTS OF UP TO 3-6 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE IN
NORTHEASTERN TN...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF
THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. NORTHERN PLATEAU COULD SEE LOCALLY HEAVY
BANDING OF SNOW AS THE WRAP AROUND MOISTURE FROM THE LOW PRESSURE
MAKES ITS WAY INTO THE AREA. DRY AIR WILL THEN MOVE IN BEHIND THIS
LOW...WITH SNOW ENDING AROUND CHATTANOOGA SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE. BY
MID MORNING...THE REST OF THE PLATEAU AND VALLEY WILL SEE SNOW
ENDING. UPSLOPE FLOW WILL BE PRESENT WITH SNOW CONTINUING FOR THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. EVEN
THOUGH MOISTURE IS SHALLOW IN THE SOUNDINGS AT THIS
TIME...EXPECTING ANOTHER ONE TO TWO INCHES ACCUMULATION ACROSS THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MOST ACCUMULATION WILL BE ON ELEVATED SURFACES
AND GRASSY AREAS...WITH SOME MELTING ON ROADWAYS. 

WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL STAY 
IN THE LOW TO MID 30S...WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES THROUGH THE LATE 
AFTERNOON. ANY SNOW LEFT ON THE GROUND MAY LOWER TEMPERATURES 
ANOTHER DEGREE OR TWO FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT LEFT LOW 
TEMPERATURES IN THE MID TEENS TO THE LOWER 20S. WINDS WILL 
BE GUSTY WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH WIND CHILL VALUES 
REACHING THE TEENS ACROSS THE AREA. 

FOR THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY...HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE IN FOR THE 
REST OF THE WORK WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND. CLEARING SKIES AND A WARMING 
TREND WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL APPROACH
NEAR NORMAL BY FRIDAY. NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN LOOKS TO BE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT
INTO MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY COLD AND VERY DRY AIR MASS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF 
HIGH CLOUDS MOVING NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY...OUT 
AHEAD OF AN AMPLIFYING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL HELP TO DEVELOP A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO TONIGHT...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED MOISTURE 
RAPIDLY SPREADING NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN DEVELOPING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH A WELL-ABOVE-FREEZING 850 MB 
LAYER DEVELOPING SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING. THIS TYPE OF 
VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE IS SUPPORTIVE OF EITHER SLEET OR FREEZING 
RAIN...BUT SINCE TONIGHT'S TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO EITHER REMAIN ABOVE 
FREEZING OR QUICKLY RISE ABOVE FREEZING AFTER THE PRECIP BEGINS... 
WILL JUST MENTION RAIN AND A CHANCE OF SLEET (WITH NO SLEET 
ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED). AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE 
WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL STORM 
SYSTEM WILL IMPACT THE REGION TUESDAY...TUESDAY NIGHT AND INTO THE 
DAY ON WEDNESDAY...BEFORE EXITING THE AREA LATE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. WIDESPREAD AREAS OF PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE OVER THE 
AREA TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT /SOME LOCALLY HEAVY AT TIMES/...WITH 
STORM TOTAL AMOUNTS OF BETWEEN 2 TO 4 INCHES OF LIQUID PRECIPITATION 
POSSIBLE THROUGH 12Z THURSDAY. THERE ARE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES 
BETWEEN THE MODELS...BUT THEY ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT 
TO BRINGING PRECIPITATION TO THE AREA DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. HAVE 
GONE CATEGORICAL POPS ALL DAY TUESDAY...BEFORE GRADUALLY LOWERING 
THEM TO LIKELY ALONG THE PLATEAU LATE TUESDAY AND EVENTUALLY 
TAPERING THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ON WEDNESDAY. THE INITIAL 
IMPACTS FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND PERHAPS 
SOME FLOODING DUE TO THE PERSISTENT RAINS EXPECTED ON TUESDAY/ 
TUESDAY EVENING. THEN...AS COLDER AIR MOVES INTO THE REGION TUESDAY 
NIGHT...THIS RAIN WILL TURN TO SNOW AND RESULT IN SOME ACCUMULATIONS 
ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE SMOKIES...THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND 
CUMBERLAND MOUNTAINS AND PORTIONS OF FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. 

ON TUESDAY MORNING...TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT 
SOME SLEET MIXING IN WITH THE RAIN AND PERHAPS RESULT IN SOME MINOR 
ICING AND BLACK ICE FORMING ON THE AREA ROADWAYS. HOWEVER...BY MID 
TO LATE MORNING TEMPERATURES WILL INCREASE AND A MODERATE TO LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAIN WILL LIKELY FALL FOR MOST OF THE DAY. A COLD FRONT IS 
THEN PROGGED TO SWEEP THROUGH THE REGION LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND 
WILL USHER IN SOME COOLER INTO THE AREA BY THE EVENING AS WINDS 
SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST. THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE ALOFT PARTICULARLY 
COOLS...AND THIS COMBINED WITH A STILL FAIRLY MOIST ATMOSPHERE WILL 
SUPPORT AN EVENTUAL CHANGE OVER FROM RAIN TO SNOW OVERNIGHT. THIS 
WILL OCCUR FIRST IN THE EVENING HOURS ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS...AND THEN 
ACROSS THE VALLEY AFTER MIDNIGHT AS TEMPERATURES APPROACH THE 
FREEZING MARK. BY WEDNESDAY MORNING...THE SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO PULL 
EAST OF THE AREA...BUT SNOW SHOWERS FROM WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE 
BACK SIDE OF THE TROUGH WILL BE POSSIBLE /ESPECIALLY ALONG THE 
MOUNTAINS AND THE NORTHEAST ZONES/. BY THE AFTERNOON...DRY AIR WILL 
FILTER INTO THE AREA FROM WEST TO EAST AS THE SYSTEM DEPARTS... 
DIMINISHING ANY LINGERING PRECIPITATION BY THE EVENING. 

AS IS USUALLY THE CASE WITH ANY WINTER WEATHER FORECAST ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS...THERE IS UNCERTAINTY IN 
THE EXACT TRACK OF THE UPPER LOW...THE DURATION OF THE DEEP MOISTURE 
PLUME AND WHEN IT WILL COINCIDE WITH THE COLDER AIR MOVING IN. 
THOUGH THE MODELS ARE GENERALLY IN AGREEMENT...THERE ARE SOME SUBTLE 
DIFFERENCES WHICH CERTAINLY HAVE A LARGER IMPACT WHEN IT COMES TO 
SNOWFALL FORECASTING AND ACCUMULATIONS. AS IT STANDS NOW...THE 
POTENTIAL FOR ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL APPEARS TO BE GREATER THAN IT 
DID YESTERDAY GIVEN COLDER AIR MOVING IN FASTER COMBINED WITH A 
STILL VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE TUESDAY NIGHT. AIDING THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SNOW ALONG THE TERRAIN WILL BE A STOUT NORTHWEST FLOW ON WEDNESDAY 
ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW WHICH WILL ENHANCE OROGRAPHIC LIFT. THIS 
MAY ALLOW FOR SOME LOCALLY HEAVIER SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS ON WEDNESDAY. 
THUS...THINK THAT SOME ADVISORY-LEVEL SNOWS ARE FAIRLY LIKELY 
ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...FAR NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND THE GREAT SMOKY MOUNTAINS. ADDITIONALLY...SOME 
ACCUMULATIONS OF AROUND AN INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU AND NORTHERN VALLEY. ELSEWHERE...SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS 
LESS THAN HALF AN INCH WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY 
AND FOOTHILLS. THOSE WITH TRAVEL PLANS DURING THIS TIME PERIOD 
SHOULD CERTAINLY MONITOR THE PROGRESS OF THIS STORM SYSTEM AND THE 
LATEST FORECAST INFORMATION OVER THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. 

IN WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM...UPPER-RIDGING WILL BUILD IN FOR 
THANKSGIVING AND THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...RESULTING IN A DRY FORECAST 
THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...VERY CHILLY CONDITIONS CAN 
BE EXPECTED FOR THANKSGIVING AND BLACK FRIDAY...AS HIGHS WILL REACH 
THE MID 30S TO MID 40S AND LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE UPPER TEENS 
AND 20S.

THE UPPER LOW WILL DIG INTO SOUTHEAST TX/SW LA. FARTHER NORTH 
ANOTHER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS. THE COMBINATION 
OF THE TROUGHS COMING INTO PHASE SHOULD CAUSE THE SYSTEM TO BE A 
LITTLE MORE PROGRESSIVE. RECALLING YESTERDAY/S MODELS...THIS IS MORE 
IN LINE WITH THE ECMWF SOLUTION AND THE MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER 
AGREEMENT TODAY WITH THIS SOLUTION. 

TUESDAY NIGHT COLDER AIR WILL FILTER IN FROM THE NORTHWEST. THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SW VA SHOULD SEE RAIN BEGIN TO CHANGE OVER TO 
SNOW BEFORE MIDNIGHT..PERHAPS CHANGING TO SLEET BRIEFLY. MANY 
LOCATIONS WILL EXPERIENCE THE CHANGEOVER TO SNOW BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. PREVIOUS FORECAST DRIED THINGS OUT A LITTLE TOO QUICKLY 
GIVEN NORTHWEST FLOW AND OROGRAPHIC SNOW POTENTIAL FOR 
WEDNESDAY...IN THE WAKE OF THE TROUGH. SO...ADDITIONAL LIGHT 
SNOWFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE UNTIL AT LEAST EARLY AFTERNOON ON 
WEDNESDAY. FIRST GUESS SNOW TOTALS WILL BE HIGHEST ACROSS RUSSELL 
COUNTY VA AND HIGHEST MOUNTAIN ELEVATIONS WITH 3 TO 6 INCHES 
POSSIBLE. OTHER AREAS LIKE THE PLATEAU AND PARTS OF THE NORTHERN 
VALLEY MAY SEE 1 TO 2 INCHES OR LESS. ICE ACCUMULATIONS LOOK TO BE 
LESS THAN TWO TENTHS OF AN INCH WITH MAX ICE ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE 
OVER SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN. 

AFTER WEDNESDAY THE SKY WILL CLEAR AND NO SIGNIFICANT WEATHER IS 
EXPECTED THROUGH NEXT WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY... 
WITH AN UNSEASONABLY COLD AND VERY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. THE CENTER OF THIS HIGH WILL BECOME LOCATED OVER THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS BY THIS EVENING...WITH UNSEASONABLY COLD AND TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA INTO TONIGHT. HIGH 
CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT OVER THE FORECAST AREA...AHEAD OF AN 
AMPLIFYING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE MAIN FOCUS OF THE 
EXTENDED FORECAST WILL BE A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
THAT WILL IMPACT THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY... 
BRINGING ANOTHER SHOT OF COOLER AIR AND WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION TO 
THE REGION. A SURFACE LOW WILL SHIFT NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE GULF 
COAST TOWARD THE CAROLINAS/MID-ATLANTIC MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. 
AS ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES OVER THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT...THIS 
WILL PRODUCE BROAD AREAS OF SHOWERS THAT WILL LIFT NORTHEASTWARD 
INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA QUICKLY AFTER 
SUNSET...AND BRING ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF PRECIPITATION TUESDAY AND 
TUESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE SHIFTING EAST OF THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON. THERE ARE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
MODELS...BUT THEY ARE ALL IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO BRINGING 
PRECIPITATION TO THE AREA DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. GIVEN THIS...HAVE 
INCREASED POPS MONDAY NIGHT TO LIKELY ACROSS A GOOD PORTION OF THE 
AREA...AND HAVE GONE CATEGORICAL TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE 
BEGINNING TO GRADUALLY TAPER THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ON WEDNESDAY.

THE PRIMARY QUESTION WILL BE THE TIMING OF A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE 
AND THE LOCATION/TRACK OF THE UPPER-LEVEL LOW. THIS WILL HAVE A 
LARGE IMPACT ON PRECIPITATION TYPE...WHICH COULD CHANGE FROM 
RAIN/SLEET TO RAIN TO RAIN/SNOW AND SNOW OVER THE COURSE OF THE 
EVENT. STARTING MONDAY NIGHT...TEMPERATURES SHOULD REMAIN ABOVE 
FREEZING OVER MUCH OF THE VALLEY AND EVEN SOME OF THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OVERNIGHT /DUE TO A WARM NOSE ALOFT/. HOWEVER...MODEL 
SOUNDINGS ARE INDICATING THAT A CHANGE OVER FROM RAIN TO SLEET WILL 
BE POSSIBLE LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND EARLY TUESDAY MORNING ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...PORTIONS OF THE FOOTHILLS/NORTHERN VALLEY AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. HOWEVER...AM NOT EXPECTING 
MUCH IN THE WAY OF ACCUMULATIONS...THOUGH THE THREAT FOR SOME PATCHY 
LIGHT ICING AND BLACK ICE TO DEVELOP ON ROADS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY 
TUESDAY MORNING. 

TEMPERATURES WILL WARM ALOFT AND INTO THE UPPER 30S AT THE SURFACE 
AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT ON TUESDAY AND ALLOW FOR A COLD RAIN TO FALL 
FOR MUCH OF THE DAY. THEN...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE 
REGION LATE TUESDAY AFTERNOON...USHERING IN COLDER AIR INTO THE 
AREA BY SUNSET AS TEMPERATURES COOL ALOFT. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A 
GRADUAL CHANGE OVER FROM RAIN TO SNOW OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND 
EVENTUALLY PORTIONS OF THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY LATE TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. AIDING THE POTENTIAL FOR SNOW SHOWERS ALONG 
THE TERRAIN WILL BE A STOUT NORTHWEST FLOW ON WEDNESDAY ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF THE LOW WHICH WILL ENHANCE OROGRAPHIC LIFT. THIS MAY ALLOW 
FOR SOME LOCALLY HEAVIER SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS ON WEDNESDAY. THUS...DO 
THINK THAT SOME SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS SEEM PROBABLE ALONG THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT OTHERWISE ANY ACCUMULATIONS ALONG THE NORTHERN 
VALLEYS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE SHOULD BE 
MINOR TO NONE. 

IN WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM...UPPER-RIDGING WILL BUILD IN FOR 
THANKSGIVING AND THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND...RESULTING IN A DRY FORECAST 
THROUGH THE END OF THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...VERY CHILLY CONDITIONS CAN 
BE EXPECTED FOR THANKSGIVING AND BLACK FRIDAY...AS HIGHS WILL REACH 
THE MID 30S TO MID 40S AND LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE UPPER TEENS 
AND 20S.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...CLOUDS HOLDING ON ACROSS THE
FOOTHILLS AND ERN MTNS AT MID AFTERNOON...WHILE CLEARING TREND
DOMINATES ELSEWHERE. THE BREAKS OF SUNSHINE ALLOWING A MINOR WARM
UP BEFORE THE COLD AIR BLAST ARRIVES BY LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY
EVENING. WIND CHILL INDICES IN THE SINGLE DIGITS FOR COLDEST SPOTS
OVERNIGHT. 

THINKING THERE WILL BE ENOUGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LATE TONIGHT
ACROSS SW VA AND THE NRN MTNS OF E TN TO JUSTIFY ADDING A FEW
CLOUDS. THE STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION PLUS SOME UPSLOPE FLOW...SO I
ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS. MOS MINS LOOKED RIGHT ON
TRACK. 

ABUNDANT SUNSHINE FOR SUNDAY BUT COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES WELL
INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. GENERALLY WENT CLOSE TO THE NEARLY
IDENTICAL MOS MAXES FOR SUNDAY. 

 
.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A VERY COLD MORNING 
EXPECTED MONDAY MORNING WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER TEENS TO 20S. 
SHOULD SEE A RELATIVELY GOOD WARM UP MONDAY AS THE UPPER LOW OVER 
SOUTHWEST TX APPROACHES.

THERE REMAINS A BIG DISCREPANCY BETWEEN MODELS AND THEIR HANDLING OF 
MOISTURE AND LOW PRESSURE POSITIONING. THE NAM REMAINS THE MOST 
AGGRESSIVE...YET NOT AS DEEP AS THE ECMWF AND THE GFS. THE SREF 
MODELS LOOK TO FAVOR INCREASING PRECIPITATION CHANCES BEGINNING 
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY WEDNESDAY EVENING...DEPENDING ON THE 
SPEED AND TRACK OF THE LOW. MONDAY NIGHT MAY PRODUCE A MIX OF 
RAIN...SLEET AND SNOW AT TIMES BUT ANTICIPATE WARM AIR ADVECTION 
EARLY TUESDAY MORNING TO CHANGE OVER THE WINTRY PRECIP TO ALL RAIN 
SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE. RAIN WILL CHANGE BACK TO A WINTRY MIX TUESDAY 
NIGHT AS LOW LEVEL TEMPERATURES COOL YET AGAIN. THE SURFACE LOW 
SHOULD BE SOMEWHERE BETWEEN MOBILE AND ATLANTA...AGAIN THERE IS A 
LOT OF UNCERTAINTY TO THE SFC LOW LOCATION. MIXED PRECIPITATION WILL 
BE A GOOD POSSIBILITY THROUGH THE DAY WEDNESDAY. DO NOT BE SURPRISED 
TO SEE HIGHER ELEVATIONS RECEIVE RAIN...RATHER THAN WINTRY WEATHER 
BECAUSE OF THE WARMER AIR ALOFT.

THE ECMWF IS FARTHEST EAST WITH THE UPPER LOW AND THE GFS IS NOT TOO 
FAR BEHIND MOVING THE PRECIP RAPIDLY TO THE EAST. VERY FEW CHANGES 
WERE MADE TO THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WITH ALL THE UNCERTAINTY. 
PRECIPITATION COULD COME TO AN END AS EARLY AS LATE WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT.

APPALACHIANS...WITH ANOTHER STRONGER COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS NEXT COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE INTO

WINDS BEHIND IT BRINGING MUCH COLDER AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY

BRING AN END TO ANY PRECIP. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL 
COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...COOL/DRY AIR MOVING INTO THE 
AREA ON SUNDAY IN WAKE OF THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR 
MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS ALONG WITH SOME CHILLY TEMPERATURES GIVEN 
THE NORTHERLY FLOW AS HIGHS WILL LIKELY STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OUT OF THE 
30S...THE LOWEST READINGS OF THE AUTUMN SEASON BY FAR. IN 
FACT...MOST LOCATIONS WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB MUCH ABOVE FREEZING. 
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL OCCUR SUNDAY NIGHT GIVEN THE 
CLEAR/CALM/DRY CONDITIONS...ALLOWING LOWS TO DROP INTO THE UPPER 
TEENS TO MID 20S IN MOST SPOTS. ATTENTION WILL THEN TURN TO A STRONG 
UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM THAT WILL IMPACT THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

A SURFACE LOW WILL SHIFT NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE GULF COAST TOWARD 
THE CAROLINAS/MID-ATLANTIC MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. AS ISENTROPIC 
LIFT INCREASES ON MONDAY NIGHT INCREASES OVER THE REGION...THIS WILL 
PRODUCE BROAD AREAS OF SHOWERS THAT WILL LIFT NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA OVERNIGHT MONDAY INTO 
TUESDAY. THERE ARE SOME DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NAM /WHICH IS MORE 
AGGRESSIVE/ AND THE GFS /WHICH IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER AND FAVORS THE 
HIGHEST INITIAL QPF SIGNALS ALONG/EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS/. STILL... 
FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO INCREASE POPS TO CHANCE TO LIKELY MONDAY 
NIGHT AND THEN WIDESPREAD LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL ON TUESDAY/TUESDAY 
NIGHT...BEFORE BEGIN TO GRADUALLY TAPER THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST 
ON WEDNESDAY.

SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL BE WELL ABOVE 
FREEZING FOR THE VALLEYS ON MONDAY NIGHT...BUT AS TEMPERATURES COOL 
AFTER MIDNIGHT SOME SNOW AND PERHAPS SOME LIGHT SLEET WILL BE 
POSSIBLE ALONG THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND THE MOUNTAINS. THE BIGGEST 
QUESTION WILL ALSO BE THE STRENGTH OF THE WARM NOSE WHICH MAY ALSO 
HELP TO KEEP SOME ELEVATED SURFACES ABOVE FREEZING. THEN...AFTER 
SUNRISE ON TUESDAY MOISTURE AND LIFT INCREASE WILL INCREASE... 
ALLOWING FOR WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION TO OVERSPREAD THE REGION. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM WELL INTO THE 40S ACROSS THE VALLEYS... 
RESULTING IN A COLD RAIN TO FALL IN MOST SPOTS DURING THE DAY AND 
INTO THE NIGHT AS WELL. HOWEVER...LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY 
THE REAL PUSH OF COLDER AIR WILL MOVE IN AS THE BASE OF THE TROUGH 
PASSES THROUGH. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SNOW OR A 
RAIN/SNOW MIX OVER THE VALLEYS AND PERHAPS SOME HEAVIER SNOW OVER 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN. STILL...SOME COLDER TEMPERATURES ALOFT AND THE 
HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT COULD ALLOW FOR SOME SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. ANY DEGREE OF IMPACT 
OR ACCUMULATION WILL DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE AND 
THE TRACK OF THE UPPER-LOW. HOWEVER...IT DOES APPEARS THAT THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE SMOKIES WILL LIKELY EXPERIENCE SOME 
ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...WHILE A MOSTLY 
RAIN OR RAIN/SNOW MIX EVENT SEEMS MORE LIKELY FOR THE VALLEYS. 
THEREAFTER...DRY AIR WILL WORK ITS WAY INTO THE REGION FOR 
THANKSGIVING DAY...AS THE PRECIPITATION MOVES EAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...APPROACHING COLD FRONT HAS 
PASSED THROUGH BOWLING GREEN KY...NASHVILLE AND MUSCLE SHOALS AL AT 
MID AFTERNOON. THE RAIN AHEAD OF THE FRONT IS GENERALLY WIDESPREAD 
AND LIGHT. KEEPING RAIN CHANCES AROUND CATEGORICAL THROUGH THE 
EVENING...WITH INCREASING FRONTOGENETIC FORCING ON THE WAY. HOWEVER
THIS FORCING DOES FALL SHARPLY BY AND AFTER 06Z SATURDAY. THUS...
I OPTED TO DECREASE POPS FROM THE NW BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z SATURDAY.
THIS CHANGE ALSO MESHES MUCH BETTER WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS.

LOWERED POPS FOR SATURDAY...BUT CAN'T TAKE POPS OUT UNITL LATE 
AFTERNOON. THIS IS DUE MOSTLY TO THE WEAK SURFACE LOW THAT MODELS 
DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT...OVER NE GA/WRN SC AROUND 12Z SATURDAY. 
THIS WOULD FAVOR HIGHER CHANCE POPS OVER SE TN...SW NC AND SMOKIES 
THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 

FOR TEMPS...GFS MOS MINS LOOKED VERY REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT. THERE 
IS VERY STRONG LOW LEVEL COLD AIR ADVECTION STILL ADVERTISED FOR 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...SO MAXES IN THE MORNING THEN FALLING TEMPS IN 
THE 18Z TO 22Z PERIOD. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF 
THIS PERIOD...SATURDAY EVENING...SURFACE COLD HIGH PRESSURE IS 
BUILDING INTO THE AREA.  MOST OF THE PRECIP WILL BE OUT OF THE 
AREA...HOWEVER THERE COULD BE SOME UPSLOPE LIGHT SNOWS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS OVERNIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY MORNING.  ALSO 
THERE WILL BE A SIGNIFICANT WIND CHILL...WITH THE MOUNTAINS GETTING 
DOWN TO NEAR ZERO AND VALLEY LOCATIONS IN THE TEENS.  FOR THESE 
SNOWFALL AMOUNTS...JUST GOING WITH ABOUT A HALF INCH FOR THE HIGHEST 
ELEVATIONS ALONG THE TN/NC BORDER.  WITH THE WINDS...THE SNOW WILL 
BE BLOWING AROUND A LOT ANYWAY. HAVE THIS UPSLOPE MOUNTAIN SNOW 
ENDING BY DAYBREAK SUNDAY MORNING.  

FOR THE SYSTEM NEXT WEEK...IT WILL TAKE A WHILE FOR THE AIR MASS TO 
MOISTEN UP...SO KEEPING POPS LOW MONDAY NIGHT...AND MAKING A 
NON-NOCTURNAL TEMPERATURE TREND AS LOW LEVEL JET INCREASES AND TAKES 
TEMPERATURES STEADY OR WARMER OVERNIGHT.  HAVE HIGH POPS FOR TUESDAY 
AND TUESDAY NIGHT...THEN STARTING TO TAPER ON WEDNESDAY AS THE NEXT 
WAVE OF COLD AIR SURGES IN.  FOR NOW HAVE THE WARMING TREND SOON 
ENOUGH THAT ALL THE PRECIP ON THE FRONT END...LATE MONDAY NIGHT...IS 
RAIN FOR NOW...WHEREAS COLD ADVECTION ON WEDNESDAY SHOULD TURN 
PRECIP TO SNOW...BUT WITH DIMINISHING MOISTURE. FOR WEDNESDAY...
HAVE TEMPERATURES ALSO STEADY OR FALLING DURING THE DAY. HAVE THAT
PRECIP TAPERING OFF IN THE MOUNTAINS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LOOKS LIKE
THE HEAVIEST OF THE PRECIP WILL SLIDE SOUTH OF OUR AREA. NONE OF
THESE SYSTEMS HAVE MUCH INSTABILITY...SO DO NOT HAVE ANY THUNDER IN
THESE PERIODS.

.DISCUSSION...SPOTTY PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN MOVING ACROSS THE

THE COLD FRONT. LATEST RUC MODEL RUN ADVANCES THE SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
PLATEAU AND INTO SE TN BY NOON...THEN THE SHOWERS SPREAD TO THE FAR

GRIDS COVER THIS SCENARIO QUITE WELL. 

12Z SOUNDINGS FROM OHX AND RNK ARE WARM ALOFT WITH OHX SOUNDING 
SATURATED FROM SURFACE TO 600 MBS. BETTER UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT IS TO 
OUR NORTH...SO EXPECTING JUST SHOWERS (NO THUNDERSTORMS) AHEAD OF

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE MID 
ATLANTIC COAST...WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM CINCINNATI 
SOUTHWEST TO NEAR MEMPHIS AND SHREVEPORT. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME 
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER THE EASTERN TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH ADDITIONAL 
SHOWERS EXPECTED LATER TODAY AS THE COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACHES. 
THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE TAF SITES SHORTLY 
AFTER SUNSET...WITH WINDS SHIFTING TO THE NORTHWEST BEHIND IT. 
HOWEVER...WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW 10 KT THROUGHOUT THE 
TAF PERIOD AT ALL THREE TAF SITES. CEILINGS MAY RISE A LITTLE AT 
KCHA AND KTYS LATER TODAY...BUT SHOULD THEN LOWER WITH ANY SHOWER 
ACTIVITY IN THE AFTERNOON. CEILINGS ARE EXPECTED TO LOWER INTO IFR 
RANGES AT KCHA AND MVFR RANGES AT KTYS AND KTRI TONIGHT BEHIND THE 
COLD FRONT...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION. SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL AGAIN AFFECT THE TAF 
SITES TONIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...BUT WILL MENTION VCSH FOR NOW 
SINCE TIMING THESE SHOWERS AT THE TAF SITES WILL BE PROBLEMATIC.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST...WITH A 
WEAK COLD FRONT EXTENDING FROM NEAR INDIANAPOLIS SOUTHWEST TO NEAR 
MEMPHIS AND SHREVEPORT. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME SHOWERS ALREADY 
AFFECTING SOUTHEAST TN THIS MORNING...WITH ADDITIONAL SHOWERS 
EXPECTED LATER TODAY AS THIS COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVES ACROSS THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA AROUND SUNSET...WITH SHOWERS CONTINUING BEHIND IT AS 
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
ANOTHER STRONGER COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...WHICH WILL BRING AN END TO THE SHOWER 
ACTIVITY AND MUCH COLDER AIR BY SATURDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS 
AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY THROUGH 
SATURDAY...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THANKSGIVING DAY)...DRY AIR WILL 
QUICKLY FILTER INTO THE REGION IN WAKE OF THE FRONTAL PASSAGE ON 
SATURDAY...QUICKLY ENDING THE RAIN POTENTIAL AFTER 00Z AND USHERING 
IN A COOLER AIR MASS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MOSTLY CLEAR 
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL FOR SUNDAY...WITH THE LOWEST HIGHS OF THE 
SEASON BY FAR AS TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY STRUGGLE TO CLIMB OUT OF 
THE 30S. IN FACT...IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS...HIGHS MAY 
STRUGGLE TO CLIMB MUCH ABOVE FREEZING. AFTER A CLEAR/CALM AND COLD 
NIGHT SUNDAY NIGHT /IN WHICH LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE TEENS TO 
LOW 20S/...CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE AHEAD OF A STRONG UPPER- 
LEVEL STORM SYSTEM THAT WILL IMPACT THE REGION TUESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 

A SURFACE LOW WILL SHIFT NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE GULF COAST TOWARD 
THE CAROLINAS/MID-ATLANTIC ON MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. AS 
ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES ON MONDAY NIGHT OVER ALABAMA...THIS WILL 
PRODUCE BROAD AREAS OF SHOWERS THAT WILL LIFT NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA OVERNIGHT MONDAY INTO  
TUESDAY. SOUNDINGS SUGGEST THAT THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL BE WELL 
ABOVE FREEZING FOR THE VALLEYS ON MONDAY NIGHT...BUT SOME SNOW AND 
PERHAPS SOME LIGHT SLEET WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE NORTHERN PLATEAU 
AND THE MOUNTAINS. AFTER SUNRISE ON TUESDAY...MOISTURE AND LIFT 
INCREASE...BUT TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM WELL INTO THE 40S ACROSS THE 
VALLEYS...ALLOWING FOR A COLD RAIN TO FALL IN MOST SPOTS DURING THE 
DAY AND INTO THE NIGHT AS THE REAL PUSH OF COLDER AIR WILL NOT 
ARRIVE UNTIL WEDNESDAY WHEN THE BASE OF THE TROUGH MOVES THROUGH. 
STILL...SOME COLDER TEMPERATURES ALOFT AND THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT 
COULD ALLOW FOR SOME SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
A CHANGE OVER TO SOME LIGHT SNOW IN THE VALLEYS WILL ALSO BE 
POSSIBLE ON WEDNESDAY AFTER THE COLDER AIR FILTERS IN. HOWEVER...ANY 
DEGREE OF IMPACT OR ACCUMULATION WILL DEPEND ON THE AMOUNT OF 
AVAILABLE MOISTURE AND THE TRACK OF THE UPPER-LOW. AS IT APPEARS 
NOW...ANY SNOW OR RAIN/SNOW MIX WILL BE OCCURRING IN THE VALLEY AS 
THE SYSTEM IS WINDING DOWN AND SHIFTING EAST. THE BEST CHANCE FOR 
ANY ACCUMULATIONS WOULD LIKELY BE ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA... 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE MOUNTAINS. STAY TUNED FOR LATER MODEL 
RUNS AND FORECAST UPDATES ON THE PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM. 
THEREAFTER...DRY AIR WILL WORK ITS WAY INTO THE REGION FOR 
THANKSGIVING DAY...AS THE PRECIPITATION MOVES EAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SUNNY SKIES AND SOME
DOWNSLOPING E-SE WINDS HAVE SENT TEMPS SOARING OVER NE TN AND SW VA
THIS AFTERNOON...UP TO 10 TO 12 DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS.
EXPECTING CLOUDS TO ADVANCE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT...
ALONG WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN OVER SW NC/SMOKIES AND WRN
PLATEAU COUNTIES. THIS SHOULD PRODUCE A VERY MILD NIGHT...SO I
OPTED TO GO WITH THE WARMER NAM MOS MINS. NOTED THAT GFS MOS WAS 8
DEGREES TOO COOL AT CHA THIS MORNING!

MODELS SEEM IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON SHOWERS REACHING WELL INTO THE WRN
1/3RD TO 1/2 BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON FRIDAY...SO PUSHED POPS UP IN
LINE WITH THE LATEST MOS AND ADJACENT NWS GRIDS. SAW NO REASON NOT
TO GO CATEGORICAL ON POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT KEPT THUNDERSTORMS
OUT FOR NOW. 

FOR SATURDAY...TEMPTED TO LOWER POPS FASTER OVER WRN AREAS AND MAY
NEED TO MAKE THIS CHANGE WITH LATER FORECAST ISSUANCES. TEMPS WILL
HAVE NO WHERE TO GO BUT DOWN AS STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION QUICKLY
FOLLOWS THE PASSING COLD FRONT. HAVE MAX TEMPS IN THE MORNING HOURS
THEN STEADY OR FALLING. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS 
SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND OUT TO SEA SATURDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY MORNING. ANOTHER MODIFIED ARCTIC AIRMASS WILL 
DROP SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE APPALACHIAN REGION SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
SUNDAY NIGHT CHILLING THE REGION TO THE BONE ON STRONG NORTHWESTERLY 
WINDS. THE ACCOMPANYING SURFACE HIGH WILL SHIFT SLOWLY ACROSS THE 
REGION SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. AT LEAST THERE IS A CHANCE FOR SOME 
SUNSHINE TO RETURN ON SUNDAY WITH DRY ADVECTION ACROSS THE AREA. MAX 
TEMPERATURES STRUGGLE TO MAKE IT BACK INTO THE 40S ON MONDAY AS A 
DEEPENING UPPER LEVEL LOW SLIDES SOUTHEAST FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. ASSOCIATED 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE NORTHEAST FROM THE UPPER WESTERN GULF 
COAST TO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC COAST THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY. ISENTROPIC 
LIFT WILL INCREASE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE SURFACE 
LOW MOVES ALONG A TRACK JUST SOUTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE 
ECMWF IS FASTER AND COLDER THAN THE GFS WITH THE SYSTEM. WENT WITH A 
BLENDED APPROACH WHICH HAS RAIN BUILDING IN (WITH A SMALL CHANCE OF 
WINTERY PRECIP IF THE COLDER NORTHERN VALLEYS DON'T WARM FAST ENOUGH 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY) MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY BUT MIXES SNOW 
INTO THE PICTURE AS MORE CHILLY AIR DROPS INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
SYSTEM TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. WILL HAVE TO WAIT FOR LATER 
MODEL GUIDANCE TO SEE WHAT SCENARIO WILL PLAY OUT DURING THE MID  
WEEK TIMEFRAME. WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THANKSGIVING LOOKS LIKE IT 
SHOULD DRY OUT WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SUNSHINE RETURNING.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A LARGE SURFACE HIGH CENTERED
OVER THE NE STATES WAS BEGINNING TO SHIFT FAR ENOUGH TO THE
NORTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA AS SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST FLOW AROUND
THE HIGH WAS PULLING IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE NORTH FROM THE GULF INTO
THE SOUTHERN PART OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY IN THE FORM OF LOW
CLOUDS. THIS WAS SLOWING THE DROP IN TEMPERATURES OVER THE SOUTHERN
AND WESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES RANGED FROM
THE 40S TO LOWER 50S SOUTH AND WEST TO THE LOWER TO MID 30S
NORTHEAST. FOR THE REST OF TODAY AS SOUTHEAST TO EAST SURFACE FLOW
CONTINUES SKIES SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY IN THE SOUTH AND WEST
AND PARTLY CLOUDY NORTHEAST. WITH WARMER START SOUTH THIS MORNING
HIGHS SHOULD BE FAIRLY UNIFORM IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S.
UPSLOPE FLOW IN NC MAY BRING SOME VERY LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE MAINLY
CLAY AND CHEROKEE COUNTIES EARLY TODAY. TONIGHT MOISTURE INCREASES
EVEN MORE WITH SKIES STAYING MOSTLY CLOUDY AND TEMPERATURES MOSTLY
MID TO UPPER 40S. PARTIAL CLEARING NE TN TONIGHT WITH EASTERLY FLOW
SO LOWS THERE NEAR 40. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ONLY VERY SLOWLY EAST
WITH RAINFALL STAYING WELL TO THE NW OF THE REGION THROUGH THE NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...JET STREAMS CONTINUE
PHASING OVER THE OHIO VALLEY ON FRIDAY. MODERATELY STRONG ZONAL
COMPONENT OVER THE TN VALLEY WILL PUSH COLD FRONT RAPIDLY THROUGH
THE TN VALLEY FRIDAY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS EARLY
SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL IN ADVANCE OF THE
FRONT. BEST PRECIPITATION CHANCE OCCUR ACROSS MRX CWA LATE FRIDAY
AND FRIDAY NIGHT. FRONT HANGS UP SOME ACROSS SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
SATURDAY MORNING. PRECIPITATION WILL TRANSITION TO MAINLY UPSLOPE
SHOWERS ON SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN FALLING THROUGH THE
DAY SATURDAY WITH WIND CHILL READINGS IN THE 30S BY THE LATE
AFTERNOON. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE AREA
THROUGH MONDAY. WELL BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND DRY CONDITIONS
CAN BE EXPECTED INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. CUT OFF LOW MOVES THROUGH TX
EARLY NEXT WEEK. CONFIDENCE IS LOW WITH SYSTEM TRACK AND TIMING.
SURFACE LOW SHOULD DEVELOP OVER THE NW GLFMEX AND TRACK NE WITH
TIME. RESULTING PRECIPITATION COVERAGE AND TYPE QUESTIONABLE BUT
LEANING TOWARD A WARMER AND DRIER SOLUTION FOR NOW.

WITH EXTENSIVE MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS EXITING THE FORECAST
AREA AT THIS TIME. CLEARING SKIES THE NEXT FEW HOURS WILL ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO DROP UP TO AROUND 5 MORE DEGREES INTO THE LOWER TO
MID 30S. AS AREA IS INFLUENCED BY SURFACE HIGH CENTERED OVER THE
NORTHEAST STATES SKIES WILL STAY MOSTLY CLEAR THROUGH TONIGHT. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD RISE TO THE 50S DURING THE DAY AND DROP BACK
INTO THE 30S TONIGHT WHICH IS NEAR NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.
WINDS SHOULD STAY EAST TO SOUTHEAST THROUGH TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
WEAKENS AND DRIFTS SE OF THE AREA THROUGH FRIDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL
BE ABOVE NORMAL. UPPER JETS BEGIN PHASING OVER THE N TN AND OH RVR
VALLEY ON FRI. GOOD LIFT AND INCREASING MOISTURE FRIDAY.
PRECIPITATION MOVES INTO THE AREA LATE FRIDAY WITH BEST COVERAGE
FRIDAY NIGHT. BROAD UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVES EAST THROUGH THE AREA
SATURDAY. COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE LIKELY SATURDAY MORNING.
PRECIPITATION WILL TAPER OFF SATURDAY AFTERNOON WHILE TEMPERATURES
FALL DURING THE DAY LIGHT HOURS. TEMPERATURES WILL FALL INTO THE
20S SATURDAY NIGHT WITH WIND CHILLS IN THE TEENS MOST AREAS. COLD
AIR MASS CONTINUES AS SURFACE RIDGE SLIDES SE ACROSS THE AREA INTO
EARLY NEXT WEEK. CONFIDENCE LOWERS WITH REGARDS TO POTENTIAL
DEVELOPMENT AND TRACK OF GLFMEX SURFACE LOW ON TUESDAY. GOOD
POTENTIAL FOR PRECIPITATION BY TUESDAY. LOW TRACK WILL DETERMINE

249 PM EST TUE NOV 19 2013

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
A WEAK SHORTWAVE IS MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON...WHICH HAS ALLOWED SOME SCATTERED TO BROKEN DECKS OF
HIGH CLOUDS INTO THE REGION TO WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE AREA.
ADDITIONALLY...IT HAS HELPED TO REINFORCE THE COOL/DRY POST FRONTAL
AIR MASS THAT IS SITTING OVER THE AREA. WITH NORTHEASTERLY BREEZES
PREVAILING THIS AFTERNOON...TEMPERATURES HAVE REMAINED IN THE MID
40S TO LOWER 50S...DESPITE THE PARTLY/MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS.
OVERNIGHT...THE COMBINATION OF THESE LIGHT WINDS AND SOME OF THE
CLOUD COVER MAY HELP TO KEEP TEMPERATURES A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER
THAN THE MIGHT HAVE BEEN ON A TYPICAL CLEAR/CALM NIGHT. HOWEVER...
AM EXPECTING LOWS TO BOTTOM OUT IN THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S IN
MOST AREAS ONCE AGAIN. WINDS WILL VEER TO THE SOUTHEAST ON
WEDNESDAY AND INCREASE SLIGHTLY AS ANOTHER SHORTWAVE MOVES OVER THE
REGION. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER...WITH MOST
VALLEY LOCATIONS REACHING THE 50S. 

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
A RIDGE CENTERED NEAR THE FL/GA/SC COASTLINE SHOULD PROVIDE 
DRY WEATHER OVER THE REGION THROUGH THURSDAY...ALONG WITH ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPS. AS THE RIDGE SAGS SOUTHWARD AND A TROUGH MOVES INTO 
THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION...MOISTURE WILL INCREASE OVER THE 
AREA THURSDAY NIGHT. A STRENGTHENING JET STREAK TO OUR NW AND 
FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS WILL PROVIDE THE IMPETUS FOR LIFT AND PRECIP 
BEGINNING FRIDAY MORNING. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
ONSET TIMING...AND WITH THE HIGHEST POPS BEING ON FRIDAY NIGHT AHEAD 
OF THE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE. MODELS DIFFERENCES BECOME MORE APPARENT 
WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE PRECIP...WITH THE GFS AND CMC BEING FASTER 
THAN THE ECMWF AND GEFS MEAN. WILL SPEED UP THE DECLINE OF POPS ON 
SATURDAY SLIGHTLY...BUT WILL STILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE GOING FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT DUE TO SOME POTENTIAL FOR UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS AS 
COLD AIR BUILDS IN.

SUNDAY LOOKS DRY BUT VERY COLD AS AN ARCTIC AIR MASS DROPS SOUTHWARD 
ON THE WEST SIDE OF A DEEP CLOSED LOW OVER EASTERN CANADA. WENT A 
LITTLE BELOW MOS TEMPS...WITH HIGHS IN THE 30S TO LOWER 40S. A 
SLIGHT AIR MASS MODERATION WILL OCCUR MONDAY BEFORE THE ONSET OF THE 
NEXT PRECIP EVENT. THE GFS AND ECMWF MERGE A CUT OFF LOW OVER THE 
DESERT SW WITH THE NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS...WITH THE 
ECMWF BEING THE FASTER OF THE TWO MODELS. IN THIS TYPE OF 
PATTERN...THE SLOWER SOLUTION USUALLY PANS OUT...SO WILL KEEP 
MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT DRY AND BEGIN CHANCE POPS ON TUESDAY. A FASTER 
SOLUTION COULD MEAN A BETTER POTENTIAL TO SEE SOME SNOW AS THE AIR 
MASS WILL HAVE LESS TIME TO MODERATE...BUT WILL KEEP THE FORECAST 
WITH RAIN FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE HAS BUILT INTO THE REGION IN THE
WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH THE AREA LAST NIGHT.
THIS HAS HELPED TO PROMOTE SUNNY CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON AND A DRY
DAY...ALLOWING FOR HIGH TEMPERATURES TO REACH THE UPPER 50S TO MID
60S DESPITE THE NORTHWEST FLOW AT THE SURFACE. THIS EVENING...A
WEAK SHORTWAVE WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION AND BRING WITH IT A
STRONGER PUSH OF COOLER AND DRIER AIR INTO THE AREA. THIS /ALONG
WITH THE CLEAR CONDITIONS/ WILL RESULT IN SUBFREEZING TO NEAR
FREEZING TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT.
WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST AFTER SUNRISE TOMORROW AND A
LIGHT TO MODERATE BREEZE WILL HELP TO REINFORCE TO SHOT OF COOLER
AIR...AS HIGHS WILL BE NOTABLY LOWER ON TUESDAY /PEAKING IN THE MID
40S TO MID 50S/ DESPITE THE CLEAR CONDITIONS AND ABUNDANT SUNSHINE.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
RIDGING WILL SHIFT TO OUR EAST FOR WEDNESDAY...BECOMING POSITIONED 
NEAR THE COAST. THE RESULTING SW FLOW WILL PROVIDE A WARMING TREND 
FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. WE SHOULD SEE HIGH TEMPS REACHING INTO 
THE 60S BY FRIDAY.

MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL INCREASE ON FRIDAY AS A TROUGH AND UPPER JET 
STREAK DROP INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION. SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER A 
WARM FRONT WILL BRING A SLIGHT/LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS THURSDAY 
NIGHT...BUT MOST OF THE SHOWERS IN THE WARM SECTOR OF THE 
APPROACHING LOW WILL MOVE IN FRIDAY AFTERNOON. MODELS AND GEFS 
MEMBERS ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF BEST 
LIFT AND MOISTURE BEING FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. POPS DURING THESE 
PERIODS WILL BE RAISED INTO THE LIKELY RANGE. COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE 
APPEARS TO COME SATURDAY EVENING...WITH POPS DROPPING QUICKLY AS DRY 
AIR BUILDS IN. A BRIEF PERIOD OF SNOW IN NORTHERN AREAS AND 
MOUNTAINS MAY BE POSSIBLE SATURDAY NIGHT. THE AIR MASS BEHIND THE 
FRONT APPEARS VERY COLD AS THE UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES TO DEEPEN AS 
IT MOVES OFFSHORE. WILL HAVE TEMPS SUNDAY AND MONDAY WELL BELOW 
CLIMO AND A BIT BELOW GFS MOS.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT STRETCHING GENERALLY 
ALONG A LINE FROM NEAR CINCINNATI TO NEAR NASHVILLE AND MEMPHIS. AN 
UNSEASONABLY WARM AIR MASS WAS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA... 
WITH DEWPOINTS CURRENTLY IN THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S. CURRENT LAPS 
DATA AND LATEST RUC MODEL RUN INDICATES A STABLE AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA...SO EXPECT THE CONVECTIVE LINE ALONG THE COLD FRONT 
TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EAST THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...A STRONG 850 MB 
JET (WITH WINDS AROUND 60 KT) WAS STILL LOCATED OVER EASTERN KY AND 
WESTERN WV...WITH THE TAIL END OF THIS LOW-LEVEL JET PROGGED TO 
SWING OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN THIS EVENING. THUS...IT 
APPEARS THAT A FEW STORMS WITH DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS 
EVENING.

OVERALL...FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT HAVE

313 PM EST SUN NOV 17 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL
CONTINUE TO PROGRESS EASTWARD THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY THIS EVENING.
RAIN SHOWERS FROM THIS MORNING WILL REMAIN OVER EAST TN THROUGH THE
LATE AFTERNOON. BEHIND THIS CONVECTION...DEWPOINTS WILL INCREASE
AND ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE
FRONT. A FEW OF THESE STORMS COULD BECOME SEVERE...WITH DAMAGING
WIND BEING THE MAIN THREAT. VERY STRONG MID AND UPPER LEVEL WINDS
ARE ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT MOVING IN...WITH A SQUALL LINE
STRUCTURE DEVELOPING IN IL AND IN. THE FRONT WILL ARRIVE ON THE
PLATEAU BETWEEN 10 AND 12 PM.

FROM THE WIND PROFILE...LOOKS LIKE DAMAGING WINDS ARE THE MAIN 
THREAT. THERE IS A VERY SMALL AMOUNT OF CAPE AND VERY LITTLE TURNING 
OF THE WINDS IN THE LOW LEVELS...SO A TORNADO POSSIBILITY IS VERY 
LOW. HOWEVER...CAN NOT COMPLETELY RULE OUT A TORNADO IN A BOOK END 
VORTICE OR BOWING SEGMENT OF THE SQUALL LINE. AMPLE MID AND UPPER 
LEVEL DRY AIR IS ADVECTED INTO THE AREA WITH THIS LINE...REINFORCING 
THE DAMAGING WIND POTENTIAL. 

TWO MINUTE WIND SPEEDS AND WIND GUSTS ARE RIGHT ON THE BORDER OF A
WIND ADVISORY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...SOUTHWEST VA...AND
PLATEAU. DUE TO THE LINE MOVING INTO THE AREA...HAVE DECIDED TO
GO WITH AN ADVISORY THROUGH 4 AM. THE FRONT LOOKS TO MOVE EAST OF
THE SMOKIES A LITTLE BEFORE SUNRISE ON MONDAY MORNING. GUSTY WINDS
MAY STILL BE PRESENT ON MONDAY...WITH SKIES CLEARING QUICKLY
THROUGH THE MORNING. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN SET IN FOR MONDAY AND
MONDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL COOL BEHIND THE FRONT TO A FEW
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. 


.LONG TERM...COOL AND DRY AIR WILL REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK AS A SURFACE HIGH BUILDS 
INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL RESULT IN NOTABLY LOWER TEMPERATURES FOR 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK WEEK AS HIGHS WILL PEAK IN THE MID 
40S TO LOWER 50S...BEFORE A GRADUAL WARMING TREND OCCURS LATER IN 
THE WEEK AS WINDS VEER TO THE SOUTH. THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY 
NIGHT...A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT INTO THE 
AREA...YIELDING A GOOD CHANCE FOR RAIN THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT...BEFORE IT CLEARS THE REGION SOMETIME ON SATURDAY. THUS... 
HAVE INCREASED POPS TO HIGH-END CHANCE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD GIVEN 
THE FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN THE MODELS ON THE TIMING/TRACK OF 
THIS SYSTEM. NORTHWEST FLOW WILL THEN PREVAIL IN WAKE OF THIS 
SYSTEM...BRINGING ANOTHER SHOT OF COOL AIR INTO THE REGION FOR THE 
WEEKEND.

835 PM EST SAT NOV 16 2013

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. A SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY IS PROGGED TO STRENGTHEN OVERNIGHT...WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT 
HELPING TO GENERATE A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT. TEMPS 
HAVE FALLEN QUICKLY SINCE SUNSET...BUT ARE CURRENTLY CLOSE TO THE 
DEWPOINTS...SO DO NOT EXPECT MUCH MORE COOLING OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER... 
WILL NEED TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO LOWER MINS FOR 
TONIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CURRENT TRENDS.

ON SUNDAY...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT WIND SHEAR WILL BECOME 
FAIRLY STRONG OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...WITH 
BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS REVEALING HELICITY VALUES IN EXCESS OF 
500 M2/S2. IN FACT...THE NAM MODEL INDICATES THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME 
MARGINAL INSTABILITY ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON...WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THE 
POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SUPERCELLS FORMING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. HOWEVER...THE GFS MODEL IS NOT AS UNSTABLE 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT DOES REVEAL SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. IF THE NAM MODEL VERIFIES...IT APPEARS THAT 
ISOLATED TORNADOES WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON...BUT EITHER WAY...IT APPEARS THAT SEVERE TSTORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE AS SOON AS SUNDAY AFTERNOON OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT... 
AND THEN AGAIN LATER SUNDAY EVENING ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...HAVE UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS 
WEATHER OUTLOOK TO MENTION THESE POSSIBILITIES ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING.

.AVIATION...STRONG STORM SYSTEM PRESSING EAST ACROSS THE PLAINS
WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER IN THE DAY SUNDAY
TRHOUGH SUNDAY EVENING. STRENGTHENING GRADIENT IN PRESSURE BETWEEN
THE RETREATING WESTERN ATLANTIC RIDGE AND DEEPENING TROUGH ACROSS
THE PLAINS WILL LEAD TO FASTER LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW ACROSS THE
HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AND A NICE DOWNSLOPE
PATTERN OVER THE GREAT VALLEY MAINLY FROM AROUND TYS NORTHEAST
THROUGH TRI. THEREFORE...IT WILL BE A LITTLE HARD TO KEEP AN MVFR
OR LOWER CEILING FROM FORMING HERE UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY SUNDAY.
HOWEVER...THE LACK OF DEEPER MOISTURE AT THESE TERMINALS MAY ALLOW
FOR SOME MVFR TO OCCASIONALLY IFR REDUCTION IN VISIBILITY IN FOG
LATER TONIGHT. CHA IS A DIFFERENT STORY WHERE THE WEDGE HAS KEPT
POOR FLIGHT WEATHER ALL DAY LONG. WAS WONDERING IF THIS AIRPORT MAY
BREAK OUT A BIT WITH BETTER FLIGHT CONDITIONS BUT WITH NIGHTFALL
AND A STRENGTHENING MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW...CONDITIONS MAY REMAIN
MVFR/IFR OVERNIGHT. CHA WOULD BE THE FIRST LOCATION TO SEE SOME
PRE-FRONTAL SHOWERS DEVELOP AND ADDED THESE AT 16Z WHILE TYS AND
TRI MAY NOT EXPERIENCE THE ADVANCING SHOWERS UNTIL 21Z OR LATER. OF
COURSE...WITH THIS DYNAMIC SYSTEM THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF
CONVECTION BUT LEFT OUT FOR NOW AS INSTABILITY APPEARS TO SOMEWHAT
LIMITED.

256 PM EST SAT NOV 16 2013

.SHORT TERM(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
OVER THE NORTHERN OHIO VALLEY WILL CONTINUE NORTHEAST...WITH A COLD
FRONT APPROACHING THE AREA THROUGH SUNDAY. FLOW IS GENERALLY FROM
THE SOUTHWEST...WITH PLENTY OF ISENTROPIC LIFT KEEPING LOW LEVELS
VERY MOIST. OVERCAST SKIES WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS THIS
FRONT APPROACHES. FOR TONIGHT...LOWS WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL DUE TO
THE TEMPERATURE ADVECTION AND CLOUD COVER. DIVERGENCE ALOFT WILL
SET IN OVER THE AREA FOR THE LATE MORNING. THERE IS ENOUGH LIFT FOR
ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS TO DEVELOP...MAINLY ON THE PLATEAU AND
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON MODELS ARE SHOWING A LITTLE BIT MORE 
INSTABILITY THAN PREVIOUS RUNS ALTHOUGH INSTABILITY IS STILL WEAK. 
BUT FORCING SEEMS TO BE IN PLACE FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. A FEW 
OF THESE COULD BECOME SEVERE...ALTHOUGH THE PROBABILITY IS LOW. THE 
MAIN THREAT WITH THESE STORMS IS STRONG WINDS. 

FOR SUNDAY EVENING INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...THE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS COULD 
DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT...WITH WINDS INCREASING IN STRENGTH. 
THE WIND PROFILE SHOWS BACKING WINDS AT THE SURFACE...CHANGING TO 
MORE UNIDIRECTIONAL FLOW AS THE FRONT NEARS. A SQUALL LINE STRUCTURE 
IS EXPECTED WITH THIS FRONT...WITH DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE MAIN 
THREAT. THE THREAT FOR TORNADOES LOOKS UNLIKELY...BUT DUE TO THE 
NATURE OF THE SQUALL LINE...CAN'T RULE OUT A TORNADO DEVELOPING IN A 
BOOK END VORTICE OR BOWING SEGMENT OF THE LINE. THE FRONT IS THEN 
EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST OF THE AREA A LITTLE AFTER SUNRISE MONDAY 
MORNING...WITH CLEARING SKIES BEHIND THE FRONT.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/... IN WAKE OF THE STORM
SYSTEM THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT...DRY AND
COOLER AIR WILL QUICKLY FILTER INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS
WILL RESULT IN NOTABLY LOWER TEMPERATURES FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK
AHEAD AS HIGHS WILL PEAK IN THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S THROUGH
MIDWEEK...BEFORE A GRADUAL VEERING OF THE SURFACE FLOW OCCURS TO
THE SOUTH AND EAST BY THURSDAY. WITH ZONAL FLOW ALOFT FOR MUCH OF
THE WEEK AHEAD...DRY CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL AT THE SURFACE AS WELL
THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. THEREAFTER...A STORM SYSTEM IS
PROGGED TO MOVE IN FROM THE WEST AND PUSH A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE
REGION...BRINGING A GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR
THE UPCOMING WEEKEND.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS TRENDING FASTER WITH THE 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT EARLY IN THE PERIOD AND HAVE INCREASE POPS TO 
CATEGORICAL FOR SUNDAY AND CONTINUED TO HIGH POPS INTO SUNDAY 
EVENING.  STRONG 850 MB JET WILL BRING WARM...MOISTURE AND UNSTABLE

ADDITIONALLY...THE STRONG WINDS ALOFT WILL PROVIDE STRONG SHEAR.  
THIS WILL ALL COMBINE TO CREATE ORGANIZED SCATTERED CONVECTION ALONG

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...AN UPPER LEVEL
DISTURBANCE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION. ENOUGH UPPER
LEVEL DIVERGENCE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL KEEP RAIN SHOWERS
DEVELOPING AND MOVING NORTHEAST THROUGH THE AREA THROUGH THE LATE
EVENING. THE MID LEVELS WILL THEN DRY CONSIDERABLY WITH THE LOWER
LEVELS REMAINING VERY MOIST. DRIZZLE IS STILL POSSIBLE IN NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IN THE LATE EVENING TO MIDNIGHT. A
STRATUS DECK WILL SET IN OVERNIGHT...WITH FOG DEVELOPMENT ACROSS
THE CWA. A FEW PLACES COULD SEE DENSE FOG...WITH LOW VISIBILITIES.
SATURDAY WILL REMAIN DRY WITH CLOUDY SKIES. A COLD FRONT WILL THEN
APPROACH THE AREA FROM THE WEST. MODELS IN POOR AGREEMENT OVERNIGHT
SATURDAY...BUT THERE SEEMS TO BE ENOUGH FORCING FOR ISOLATED
SHOWERS. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR
TONIGHT AND TOMORROW NIGHT.


.LONG TERM /SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
A STRONG STORM SYSTEM WILL IMPACT THE REGION EARLY NEXT WEEK... 
BRINGING THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND STRONG TO 
POSSIBILITY SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING... 
BEFORE IT CLEARS THE AREA BY MONDAY MORNING. AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT...A STRONG 40-50+ KT SOUTHERLY LLJ WILL HELP TO PUSH UPPER 
50S/LOWER 60S DEWPOINTS INTO THE AREA ON SUNDAY. HOWEVER...THERE IS 
STILL A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY GIVEN THE 
POTENTIAL FOR CLOUD COVER/SHOWERS DURING THE MORNING ACROSS THE WARM 
SECTOR. ADDITIONALLY...INSTABILITY DOES WANE SOMEWHAT AFTER 
SUNSET...SO THE TIMING OF STORMS AND THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT WILL 
BE IMPORTANT TO ASSESSING THE SEVERE WEATHER POTENTIAL. HOWEVER... 
GIVEN THE STRONG DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM AND FAVORABLE 
WIND PROFILES FOR SUPERCELLS/ORGANIZED ROTATING STORMS...THINK THAT 
A REASONABLE SHOT FOR SEVERE WEATHER WILL EXIST LATE SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY 
ZONES/. MODEL NAM SOUNDINGS AT KCHA AND KTYS SHOW CURVED/SICKLE 
SHAPED HODOGRAPHS...INDICATING GOOD 0-1 KM SPEED AND DIRECTIONAL 
SHEAR. THUS...CANNOT RULE OUT SOME ISOLATED TORNADOES IN ADDITION TO 
THE PRIMARY THREATS OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND DAMAGING 
THUNDERSTORM WINDS.

AFTER MIDNIGHT...THE FRONT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE MOUNTAIN 
ZONES AND TO THE EAST OF THE REGION BY MONDAY MORNING. IN ITS WAKE 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION AND BE ACCOMPANIED 
BY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT FOR MUCH OF THE WEEK AHEAD. THIS WILL RESULT IN 
MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS FOR THE UPCOMING WEEK...BUT ALSO NOTABLY 
COOLER CONDITIONS WITH HIGHS ONLY PEAKING IN THE MID 40S TO LOWER 
50S EACH DAY AND LOWS BOTTOMING OUT IN THE 20S TO MID 30S EACH

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...TODAY WILL BE ANOTHER DAY FILLED 
WITH SUNSHINE AS A DRY AIRMASS COVERS MOST OF THE EASTERN HALF OF 
THE U.S. THE PROTECTIVE RIDGE OVER THE REGION WILL GRADUALLY SHIFT 
EAST TO THE WESTERN ATLANTIC WHILE A WEAK UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES 
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SLIPS EAST THE LOW 
LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME SOUTHERLY. THIS WIND SHIFT AND NEARLY FULL 
INSOLATION WILL BOOST TEMPERATURES A GOOD 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE 
YESTERDAY'S MAXIMUMS. STEADILY STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW ALOFT 
AHEAD OF THE UPPER TROUGH WILL LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA LATER TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE TRENDING TOWARD A 
MORE AMPLIFIED SHORTWAVE TROUGH ON FRIDAY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS RUNS. 
POSITIVE THETA-E ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL MOVE INTO 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS FRIDAY MORNING AND SPREAD NE. POPS WILL BE RAISED 
ACROSS THE BOARD FRIDAY AFTERNOON...BUT WILL REMAIN IN THE CHANCE 
RANGE. A STRENGTHENING RIDGE OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST WILL BRING A 
WARM SW FLOW TO THE AREA SATURDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 
60S.  

MODELS ARE COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT FOR SUNDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY...BUT STILL HAVE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE GFS 
CONTINUING TO SHOW A FASTER OPEN WAVE TROUGH...AND THE ECMWF AND 
CANADIAN SHOWING A SLOWER CLOSED UPPER LOW. SPREAD AMONG GEFS 
MEMBERS IS LESS...AND MOST MEMBERS ARE CLUSTERING AROUND SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING FOR THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES. WILL HAVE LIKELY 
POPS IN THIS PERIOD. WITH A LLJ OF 40-50 KTS AND 850 MB THETA-E 
VALUES AROUND 330K...WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. 
UPPER JET IS NOT IN A FAVORABLE POSITION TO PROVIDE A THREAT OF 
SEVERE STORMS. EVEN THE SLOWER ECMWF HAS MOST PRECIP OUT OF THE AREA 
BY 12Z MONDAY. WILL CUT BACK POPS TO A CHANCE EAST MONDAY 
MORNING...WITH ALL POPS ENDING IN THE AFTERNOON. 

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WILL BE DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY...BUT THERE ARE 
LARGE DIFFERENCES IN TEMPS BETWEEN THE GFS...ECMWF...WPC 
GUIDANCE...AND MOS ENSEMBLE MEAN. THE 00Z GFS HAS SUDDENLY COME IN 
WARMER. WILL TREND TEMPS UPWARD BUT STILL UNDERCUT GFS MOS BY

SHIFTS TO THE CAROLINAS THURSDAY NIGHT WITH SW FLOW ALOFT WARMING 
LOWS 5 TO 10 DEGREES. FRIDAY WARMING IS CURTAILED BY INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE AS 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE REGION. LOW LEVEL 
WARM ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT TO INCREASE CLOUDS FRIDAY MORNING 
AND AFTERNOON. MODELS DIFFER ON STRENGTH OF SYSTEM AND AMOUNT OF 
PRECIPITATION PRODUCED. WILL TREND TO THE LIGHTER AMOUNTS OF THE GFS 
AND NAM MAINLY SOUTH AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS FOR LATE FRIDAY THROUGH 
SATURDAY. WITH THE VERY DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE RIGHT NOW. IT WILL 
TAKE AWHILE BEFORE AIR MASS SATURATES.  

TROUGH DEEPENS TO THE WEST SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT OVER THE 
PLAINS. THE ATLANTIC COAST RIDGE STAYS STRONG THROUGH SUNDAY. SW 
FLOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES MILD WITH HIGHS IN THE 60S THROUGH 
MONDAY. LOWS FRIDAY STILL MOSTLY BELOW FREEZING BUT ABOVE FREEZING 
SATURDAY. AS NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES SUNDAY BEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY THEN DECREASING LATE MONDAY INTO 
MONDAY NIGHT. STRONG SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW AHEAD OF SYSTEM AND 
CONSIDERABLE CLOUD COVER HAS NIGHT TIME LOWS ONLY DROPPING INTO TO 
40S TO LOWER 50S SUNDAY MORNING. A WARM FRONT MOVING THROUGH EARLY 
SUNDAY WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM TO THE MID 60S TO NEAR 70 AND 
THEN FALL INTO THE MID TO UPPER 50S EARLY MONDAY AHEAD OF A 
SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT. TUESDAY SHOULD BE 10 TO 15 DEGREES COLDER 
BEHIND FRONT AND EVEN COLDER WEDNESDAY AS THE LARGE CANADIAN HIGH

WILL KEEP MINS IN THE 40S TO LOWER 50S THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. MAX 
TEMPS MAY ALSO WARM AS MUCH AS 10 DEGREES ABOVE CLIMO FOR MID 
NOVEMBER...SO I CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE SIMILAR 00Z/12Z GFSX AND ECMX 
MOS TEMPS.  

IF TIMING ON THE MONDAY SYSTEM HOLDS TRUE...THEN FALLING TEMPS MAY 
OCCUR ON TUESDAY BEHIND PASSAGE OF ANOTHER STRONG COLD FRONT. NOT 
SEEING TEMPS DROP ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY ANY MENTION OF SNOW JUST YET.
HOWEVER...I DID UNDERCUT THE GFSX MOS MAX TEMPS ON TUESDAY...A BIT 
OF COMPROMISE WITH THE MUCH COOLER ECMX MAXES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A STRONG COLD FRONT CURRENTLY LOCATED ACROSS KY WILL PUSH INTO THE 
AREA THIS MORNING. A FEW SHOWERS ARE MOVING THROUGH SW VA AND NE TN 
EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT THE BULK OF THE SHOWERS ARE ALONG OR BEHIND 
THE FRONT. OBS AROUND THE OHIO RIVER SHOW A RAPID DROP IN TEMPS WITH 
A CHANGE TO SNOW...AND EXPECT A SIMILAR TREND LATER THIS MORNING IN 
OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES. MODELS INDICATE WEAKENING LIFT AS THE FRONT 
APPROACHES...WITH A NARROW WINDOW OF MOISTURE DEEP ENOUGH FOR 
MEASURABLE PRECIP...12Z-18Z. THUS TOTAL LIQUID QPF AMOUNTS ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE AT MOST A TENTH OF AN INCH IN SW VA. 

FREEZING LEVELS DURING THE PRECIP PERIOD DROP FROM 2500 TO 2000 FT.
WITH WARM GROUND TEMPS...SNOW ACCUMULATION WILL BE LIMITED...EVEN
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. UP TO ONE INCH IS EXPECTED AT HIGH
KNOB...NE TN MOUNTAINS...AND THE SMOKIES. WITH STEEP LAPSE RATES
BEHIND THE FRONT...SNOW SHOWERS WITH ABOVE FREEZING SURFACE TEMPS
WILL LIKELY OCCUR IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA...NE TN...AND
NORTHERN PLATEAU...BUT NO ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED AS MOISTURE
DEPTH IS GONE ONCE SURFACE TEMPS DROP LOW ENOUGH. THERE IS SOME
LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY IN THE AFTERNOON ALONG WITH A 20-25 KT
UPSLOPE WIND...AND THIS MAY BRING SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT
ACCUMULATION TO THE SMOKIES AND NE TN MOUNTAINS IN THE
AFTERNOON...WITH UP TO ONE INCH POSSIBLE. ALL PRECIP WILL END IN
THE EVENING AS MOISTURE EXITS.

NORTH WINDS TODAY WILL BE GUSTY...PERHAPS AS HIGH AS 35 MPH...BUT 
SHOULD STAY JUST BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. WILL CONTINUE THE SPS 
MENTIONING BREEZY CONDITIONS...LOW WIND CHILL VALUES...AND LIGHT 
SNOW ACCUMULATION IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
RIDGING BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL START THE EXTENDED PERIOD FOR
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH CLEAR SKY WITH COLD MORNINGS AND MILD
AFTERNOONS. AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITIES WILL BE QUITE DRY WITH
VALUES DROPPING INTO THE 20S EACH DAY.

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...UPPER RIDGING MOVES EAST WITH FLOW 
BECOMING SOUTHWEST. A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES WILL EJECT NORTHEAST 
FROM A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE GREAT BASIN/ROCKIES. 
INITALLY...MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED TO THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS FOR 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...BUT SURFACE RIDING INTO THE SOUTHEAST WEAKENS 
DURING THE WEEKEND. THE WEAKENING RIDGE WILL ALLOW A SOUTHERLY 
LOW-LEVEL JET TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR LATE 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY AHEAD OF THE MAIN UPPER TROUGH LIFTING NORTHEAST 
INTO THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL INCREASE 
FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. GFS AND ECMWF SHOW A STRONG 
UPPER JET DYNAMICS OVER THE AREA FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. EVEN 
THOUGH INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED...STRENGTH OF SYSTEM MAY PRODUCE 
A CHANCE OF THUNDER OVER THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE AREA.

FRONT OVER THE OHIO VALLEY. LATE TONIGHT AS THE FRONT SAGS
SOUTH...SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO APPRAOCH
THE FAR NORTHERN ZONES ALONG THE TENNESSEE/KENTUCKY BORDER AND
ALONG THE KENTUCKY/VIRGINIA BORDER. TEMPERATURES /ESPECAILLY IN THE
VALLEYS/ SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH TO KEEP THIS PRECIPITATION IN THE
FORM OF RAIN. HOWEVER...LOCATIONS ABOVE 2000-2500 FT COULD SEE A
MIX OF SNOW AND RAIN OR EXPERIENCE SOME LIGHT SNOW CLOSE TO
DAYBREAK AS COOLER AIR WORKS ITS WAY IN...MAINLY IN THOSE HIGHER
LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE LIMITED

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A DRY ZONAL FLOW WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA TODAY AND THIS EVENING. 
EXPECT PLEASANT TEMPERATURES IN THE 60S UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES 
TODAY. 

TONIGHT...A DEEP CLOSED LOW MOVES ACROSS ONTARIO WITH A TRAILING 
UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONT PUSHING SE. THE FRONT MOVES INTO 
OUR AREA AROUND 09Z...WITH LIFT AND MOISTURE LOCATED ALONG OR BEHIND 
THE FRONT. NAM AND GFS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM. LIFT
APPEARS TIED TO 850-700 MB CONVERGENCE...WHICH GRADUALLY WEAKENS AS
IT MOVES ACROSS KY. ALTHOUGH WE ARE IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF
A STRONG UPPER JET...THE CONTRIBUTION OF AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL
CIRCULATION TO LIFT IS WEAK AS IT IS STEEPLY SLOPED TOWARD
HORIZONTAL. FRONTOGENESIS IS WEAK BY THE TIME IT REACHES OUR AREA.
MOISTURE DEPTH TO THE -10C LEVEL IS LIMITED TO A NARROW WINDOW
BETWEEN 14-18Z. ALL THIS ADDS UP TO A LIGHT PRECIP EVENT.

WITH MOST OF THE PRECIP TRAILING THE SURFACE FRONT AND 850 MB 
TROUGH...WE WILL SEE STRONG COLD ADVECTION OCCURRING IN CONJUNCTION
WITH THE PRECIP ON TUESDAY. TEMPS WILL BE FALLING THROUGH THE DAY.
A QUICK CHANGE FROM RAIN TO SNOW IS EXPECTED IN SW VA TUESDAY
MORNING...WITH THE CHANGE COMING IN THE AFTERNOON ACROSS THE
NORTHERN PLATEAU...NORTHERN TN VALLEY...AND MOUNTAINS. STEEP LAPSE
LOW LEVEL RATES AND A 20 KT NORTH WIND AT 925-850 MB WILL SLIGHTLY
ENHANCE SNOW AMOUNTS IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATE IN THE AFTERNOON.
HOWEVER...MOST PRECIP WILL STILL BE LIGHT DUE TO WEAK LIFT AND
SHALLOW MOISTURE...SO FOR NOW WILL HAVE THE HIGHEST SNOW AMOUNTS
AROUND 1 INCH IN WISE CO. AND IN THE SMOKIES. AT MOST...A DUSTING
IS POSSIBLE IN NORTHERN VALLEY LOCATIONS INCLUDING TRI-CITIES.
ABOVE-FREEZING SURFACE TEMPS DURING PRECIP WILL LIMIT ANY
ACCUMULATIONS IN THE VALLEY. KNOXVILLE MAY SEE A FEW FLAKES LATE
IN THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
UPPER TROUGH AND FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA
TUESDAY NIGHT WITH THE MAIN THEME FOR THE EXTENDED BEING THE RETURN
OF SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AS SHORT-WAVES DIG INTO THE GREAT
BASIN/ROCKIES THEN LIFT NORTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL PLAINS AND
MID-WEST FOR THE LATER HALF OF THE WEEK INTO NEXT WEEKEND.
INCREASING HIGH AND MID-LEVEL CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED. SHORT-WAVES
LIFTING NORTHEAST WILL PROVIDE INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT AS
SURFACE RIDING MOVES EAST NEXT WEEKEND.

INCREASING THICKNESS/HEIGHTS WILL ALLOW FOR A WARM-UP DURING THE 
WEEK. VERY DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED WITH AFTERNOON RELATIVE 
HUMIDITIES DROPPING INTO THE 20S WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS HIGH WILL BECOME CENTERED OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN TONIGHT...WITH DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH MONDAY. ANOTHER STRONGER 
COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE 
MONDAY NIGHT...WITH AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND IT 
CREATING SOME POST-FRONTAL PRECIP ON TUESDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
INDICATE THAT THE UPPER LEVELS WILL COOL ENOUGH ON TUESDAY FOR LIGHT 
SNOW TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED WITH THIS QUICK-MOVING 
FRONT...AND THUS...IT APPEARS THAT ONLY LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
AROUND AN INCH OR TWO WILL BE POSSIBLE ABOVE 2500 FEET. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THROUGH TUESDAY...BUT THEN REVEAL SOME LARGER DISCREPANCIES BY 
TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SEEMS BEST.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A COLD AIR MASS AND A STRONG 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN BEHIND AN EXITING COLD FRONT ON 
WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL PROVIDE A RETURN TO DRY CONDITIONS BUT HIGHS 
WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB...WITH SOME NORTHERN VALLEY LOCATION NOT 
EXPECTED TO PUSH OUT OF THE 30S. THE SURFACE HIGH SETTLES INTO THE 
AREA FOR THE REST OF THE WORK WEEK AS TEMPERATURES MODERATE. BY LATE 
FRIDAY...THE HIGH WILL BE PULLING OUT THE REGION AND WE WILL MOVE 
INTO AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED. THIS 
WILL USHER IN A CHANCE OF SHOWERS WITH BEST CHANCE CURRENTLY LOOKS 
TO BE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ALONG THE SPINE OF 
THE APPALACHIANS...WITH A MORE MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
(COMPARED TO YESTERDAY). BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTHWEST AND NORTHEAST TN...WHERE 
RELATIVE HUMIDITIES ARE EXPECTED TO FALL INTO THE 30S. WITH THIS 
NORTHWEST FLOW...WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BE STRONGER OVER THE EASTERN 
SLOPES OF THE APPALACHIANS DUE TO THE USUAL DOWNSLOPING 
ACCELERATIONS...AND DO NOT THINK THAT RED FLAG CRITERIA WINDS 
(SUSTAINED WINDS IN EXCESS OF 20 MPH) WILL BE OBSERVED IN EXTREME 
SOUTHWEST VA. HOWEVER...SINCE THE WINDS AND RELATIVE HUMIDITIES WILL 
BE CLOSE TO RED FLAG CRITERIA ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA...HAVE ISSUED A 
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO MENTION AN INCREASED FIRE DANGER FOR 
THIS AFTERNOON (AFTER COORDINATION WITH FORESTRY PERSONNEL).

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TODAY APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
WILL UPDATE THIS MORNING TO MENTION BREEZY WINDS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA 
AND NORTHEAST TN...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE 
LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SATELLITE TRENDS SHOW HIGH AND MIDLEVEL CLOUDS WILL BE DECREASING 
THIS MORNING AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO OUR SOUTH EXITS THE REGION. A 
DRY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WILL GIVE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES THROUGH TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. AT THE SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
WILL DROP SE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY EVENING. HIGH TEMPS TODAY WILL 
BE IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS...WITH LOWS IN 
THE UPPER 20S NORTH TO MID 30S SOUTH. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
MAIN CONCERN WILL BE THE FIRST TASTE OF WINTER ACROSS MUCH OF THE
AREA TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. A STRONG NORTHERN STREAM JET WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY
NIGHT WITH A COLD FRONT PULLING SOUTH ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY.
THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET WILL BE OVER THE AREA
PRODUCING DIVERGENCE ALOFT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE
DIRECT AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL CIRCULATION AROUND THIS JET WILL
CONTINUE TO ENHANCE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG THE FRONTAL
BOUNDARY. A BAND OF PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
REGION...ESPECIALLY OVERNIGHT EASTERN AND NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE
AREA. THE COLDEST AREA OF THE SEASON...THUS FAR...WILL CHANGE THE
RAIN TO SNOW. LIGHT SNOW/FLURRIES WILL BE POSSIBLE AS FAR SOUTH AS
KNOXVILLE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

TEMPERATURE PROFILE AND MOISTURE SUGGEST A LIGHT ACCUMULATION 
EXPECTED OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...FAR 
EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND POSSIBLE THE MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA. ACCUMULATIONS OF 1 TO 2 INCHES ARE POSSIBLE. A 
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED FOR THIS EVENT ACROSS THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN.

BESIDES THE PRECIPITATION...HIGH TEMPERATURES TUESDAY WILL LIKELY BE 
EARLY IN THE DAY...THEN DROP...ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE AREA. 

PRECIPITATION WILL END TUESDAY NIGHT WITH RIDGING AND WARMING TREND 
ANTICIPATED FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS 
ALOFT ANTICIPATED TOWARD NEXT WEEKEND.

WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...ECMWF BEGINNING TO COME IN 
LINE WITH THE FASTER GFS TIMING OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO TREND FASTER WITH THE FRONT AND NOW EXPECTED FRONTAL 
PASSAGE ON TUESDAY. MUCH COOLER AIR WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE WHICH WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO FALL DURING THE DAY ON 
TUESDAY. ACCOMPANYING RAIN WILL SLOWLY TRANSITION TO LIGHT SNOW OR 
FLURRIES FROM NORTH TO SOUTH LATE TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY EVENING. THE 
SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH QUICKLY AND THE RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS WILL END 
OVER THE VALLEY LOCATIONS TUESDAY NIGHT WITH ONLY A FEW LINGERING 
SNOW SHOWERS EXPECTED OVER FAR NORTHEASTERN MOUNTAINS INTO

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A ZONAL MID AND UPPER LEVEL FLOW TODAY WILL BRING SOME HIGH CLOUDS 
TO THE AREA FROM THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH OVER TX. IN THE LOW 
LEVELS...HIGH PRESSURE TO THE EAST AND A LOW TRACKING ACROSS THE 
GREAT LAKES WILL CREATE A SW FLOW WITH WEAK WARM ADVECTION. THIS 
SHOULD OFFSET THE SLIGHT INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS...SO TEMPS WILL 
TREND WARMER WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S. SOME HIGH AND 
MID CLOUDS MAY CONTINUE TONIGHT IN SOUTHERN AREAS AS THE WEAK TROUGH 
PASSES SOUTH OF OUR AREA...BUT NORTHERN AREAS SHOULD BE CLEAR. LOW 
TEMPS WILL BE NEAR MOS GUIDANCE...IN THE MID 30S TO LOWER 40S SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
SUNDAY WILL USHER IN HIGH PRESSURE UNDER NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT.
SIMILAR CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED MONDAY. THE RESULT WILL BE NEAR
SEASONAL TEMPERATURES. THE BIG STORY WILL BE THE COLD AIR MARCHING
IN QUICKLY FROM THE NORTHWEST FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT.

MODELS CAME IN BETTER AGREEMENT YESTERDAY AND THIS EVENING WITH A 
MORE PROGRESSIVE SYSTEM. JET DYNAMICS ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE TROUGH 
AXIS WOULD SEEM TO KEEP THE TROUGH MOVING FAST ACROSS THE AREA. THE 
COLD FRONT WILL LIKELY BEGIN PUSHING INTO THE AREA LATE MONDAY 
NIGHT. EXPECT THE WARMEST TEMPERATURES TO OCCUR NEAR MIDNIGHT AND 
DROP THROUGH THE DAY. ADDITIONALLY PRECIPITATION WILL FALL...FIRST 
AS RAIN AND THEN TRANSITION INTO SNOW SHOWERS BY TUESDAY NIGHT. THE 
BEST CHANCE WILL OCCUR OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA HOWEVER THE SYSTEM 
WILL BE MOVING QUICKLY AND LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATIONS ARE 
ANTICIPATED WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIGHEST TERRAIN OF SW VA AND 
THE TN MOUNTAINS. DRY AIR WILL QUICKLY FILTER INTO THE REGION ENDING 
THE PRECIPITATION BY EARLY WEDNESDAY. WEDNESDAY MORNING WILL BE COLD 
BUT THE COLDEST OF THE MORNINGS WILL BE THURSDAY UNDER CLEAR SKIES 
AND GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS. UNDERCUT GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
SLIGHTLY WED AND THU FOR BOTH MAX AND MIN TEMPERATURES. DRY 
CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT WITH SLIGHT WARMING

MODELS HAVE BEEN TRENDING FASTER WITH THIS SYSTEM. GFS IS THE

LIMITED MOISTURE.  ECMWF IS SLOWER...BUT IS TRENDING FASTER THAN 
PRIOR RUNS.  THIS MODEL BRINGS THE FRONT IN TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH A DEEPER AND WIDER BAND OF MOISTURE.  DUE TO LACK OF

HAVE KEPT WITH A COMPROMISE SOLUTION BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS AND HAVE 
TREND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE THROUGH EARLIER WITH THE HIGHEST POPS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE DRIFTING FROM WEST TO EAST ACROSS TN TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. WITH A DRY ZONAL FLOW IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...WE WILL 
SEE CLEAR SKIES THROUGH THE PERIOD. WITH THE CENTER OF THE 850 MB 
RIDGE DISPLACED TO THE SOUTHWEST AND A NORTHERLY FLOW OVER OUR 
AREA...WE WILL SEE SOME COLD ADVECTION THAT WILL HOLD TEMPS IN THE 
50S TODAY. TONIGHT WILL BE CLEAR AND CALM WITH LOWS IN THE MID 20S 
TO MID 30S. DID NOT DEVIATE FAR FROM MOS GUIDANCE ON TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
QUIET WEATHER PATTERN PERSISTS THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE
WEEKEND WITH GENERALLY ZONAL UPPER FLOW AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDING ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH MONDAY.

LONGER RANGE MODELS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY IN TERMS OF PRECIPITATION AND 
TIMING OF THE NEXT FRONTAL SYSTEM. WHILE THIS WILL BE THE COLDEST 
AIR OF THE SEASON TO MOVE INTO THE AREA IT MAY ALSO BE THE FIRST 
CHANCE OF SNOW. THERE WE SAID IT. EVEN THOUGH SNOW WILL FALL THERE 
IS STILL QUITE A DIFFERENCE IN IF IT WILL ACCUMULATE TO MUCH. ONE 
MODEL IS MUCH DRIER/FASTER MOVING THAN THE OTHER AND WOULD BE THE 
DIFFERENCE BETWEEN A TRACE AND PERHAPS A FEW INCHES IN HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. ALL THAT TO SAY THAT CONFIDENCE REMAINS QUITE LOW FOR A 
SIGNIFICANT WINTER TYPE EVENT BUT WE WILL KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON 
CHANGING DEVELOPMENTS. LITTLE TO NO CHANGES WERE MADE TO PREVIOUS 
POP FORECASTS FOR THIS TIME PERIOD.

THE COLD FRONT WILL LIKELY MOVE IN EARLY ON TUESDAY. SHALLOW COLD 
AIR MASSES ARE USUALLY NOT HANDLED WELL BY THE MODELS AND IN REALITY 
THE COLD AIR MOVES MUCH FASTER. THEREFORE THE DIURNAL TEMPERATURES FOR 
TUESDAY WERE TWEAKED TO SHOW WARMEST TEMPERATURES BY MID 
MORNING...DROPPING THROUGH THE DAY. ADDITIONALLY THE MENTION OF SNOW 
WAS ADDED PARTICULARLY LATE IN THE AFTERNOON AND TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
EARLY WEDNESDAY. THE MODELS ARE LIKELY UNDERDOING THE DRY AIR AND 
MUCH COLDER TEMPERATURES ASSOCIATED WITH THIS ARCTIC AIR MASS. AS 
SUCH HAVE LOWERED DAYTIME TEMPERATURES FOR WED AND THU AS WELL AS 
LOWERED DEWPOINT TEMPERATURES TO BETTER REPRESENT THE COLD DRY AIR 
THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
EARLY THIS MORNING...A BROAD AREA OF SHOWERS CONTINUES TO ADVANCE
EASTWARD INTO THE REGION FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE INTO THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU AND EAST TENNESSEE AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. THIS RAIN WILL
CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD THE REGION OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS AS THE
FRONT PROGRESS EAST...WITH MOST LOCATIONS RECEIVING BETWEEN ONE-
QUARTER TO ONE-HALF INCH OF RAINFALL. GIVEN THAT THE FRONT IS A
LITTLE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUSLY PROJECTED...HAVE INCREASED POPS
THROUGH MID-MORNING ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE CWA...AS SOME
SHOWERS SEEMS LIKELY THROUGH 15-18Z. HOWEVER...AFTER 18Z COOL AND
DRY AIR WILL QUICKLY FILTER INTO THE REGION...ENDING THE RAIN
POTENTIAL AND RESULTING IN A MUCH COOLER DAY AS HIGHS WILL PEAK IN
THE 50S IN MOST LOCATIONS. CLEAR AND MUCH COOLER CONDITIONS WILL
PREVAIL TONIGHT WITH SOME PATCHY FOG POSSIBLE NEAR AREA LAKES AND
RIVERS AFTER MIDNIGHT. 

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES NEEDED FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE LONG
TERM...AS THE UPPER FLOW BECOMES ZONAL AFTER PASSAGE OF UPPER
TROUGH LATE TODAY. THUS... DRY WEATHER WITH SLIGHTLY BELOW SEASONAL
TEMPS FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT.

ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND SURFACE RIDGING KEEPS DRY WEATHER AT LEAST INTO 
TUESDAY...WITH TEMPS MODERATING OVER THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. AN EAST TO WEST ORIENTED COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE 
REGION BY LATE TUESDAY. HOWEVER...BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS SHOW 
A CLOSED AND POSSIBLY CUTOFF UPPER LOW DEVELOPING OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY ON WEDNESDAY. THIS COULD SLOW THE SOUTHWARD PUSH OF THE COLD 
FRONT...ALTHOUGH CAN'T ARGUE WITH THE HIGHER TREND IN GFSX MOS POPS 
FOR LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SO I MADE THOSE 
ADJUSTMENTS TO POP AND WEATHER GRIDS.

GFSX MOS TEMPS GENERALLY CONSISTENT FROM 06/12Z TO 07/00Z RUN...
EXCEPT FOR LARGE DEVIATIONS ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. GIVEN THE 
UNCERTAINTY AT THIS POINT...I POPULATED WITH A GFS ENSEMBLE AVERAGE 
MAX TEMP FOR THOSE DAYS...RATHER THAN MAKE SUCH A DRASTIC CHANGE.

ONCE AGAIN REACH THE MID TO UPPER 60S...TO AROUND 70 DEGREES IN
MOST LOCATIONS BY THE AFTERNOON. THEN AS THE FRONT PUSHES THROUGH
OVERNIGHT...SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO OVERSPREAD THE REGION FROM WEST
TO EAST BETWEEN 03Z TO 06Z...WITH THE GREATEST POTENTIAL BEING
BETWEEN 06-12Z. AS SUCH...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO CATEGORICAL
AREAWIDE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. ALSO HAVE HIGH POPS ALONG THE
MOUNTAINS DURING THE EARLY MORNING ON THURSDAY...BEFORE QUICKLY
TAPERING THEM OFF AFTER 15Z AND REMOVING THEM ALL TOGETHER AFTER
18Z. COOL/DRY AIR WILL QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE REGION IN WAKE OF THE
FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH HIGHS ON THURSDAY REACHING THE MID 50S TO
AROUND 60 DEGREES IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
GENERALLY A 
PROLONGED DRY AND TRANQUIL PERIOD BEHIND PASSAGE OF THE UPPER TROUGH 
AND COLD FRONT EARLY THURSDAY. COOLEST NIGHT WILL BE THURSDAY NIGHT
THEN MIN TEMPS SLOWLY RISE TO AT OR JUST ABOVE CLIMO OVER THE 
WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. 

HEIGHTS RISE OVER THE WEEKEND BUT THE UPPER FLOW REMAINS NEARLY 
ZONAL. SURFACE RIDGE WILL BE A DOMINANT FEATURE AS WELL...AND 
MOISTURE MAY NOT RETURN UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT OR EARLY WEDNESDAY. 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS KEPT IN FOR TUESDAY NIGHT. MAX TEMPS NOT PROGGED 
TO WARM ANY HIGHER THAN 50S TO MID/UPR 60S DURING THIS PERIOD...
WHICH IS JUST SLIGHTLY ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS. THE 06Z GFSX MOS MAX 
TEMPS TRENDED SLIGHTLY COOLER FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...WITH MAX TEMP 
GRIDS ADJUSTED TO REFLECT THIS TREND AND MESH WITH NWS NEIGHBORS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...
LAST OF THE QUIET DAYS BEFORE THE WEATHER SYSTEM ENTERS THE PICTURE
WED NGT. BUT AS FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...MOSTLY WILL BE
EXPERIENCING VARIABLE CLOUDINESS AND A MOISTENING OF THE LOWER
LEVELS. AIR MASS WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S/60S ACROSS LA/AR/MO WILL
REPLACE OUR 30S DEWPOINTS AIR MASS...ESPECIALLY DURING WED AS S/SW
WINDS PICK UP A BIT. WILL MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN OUR
WESTERNMOST ZONES WED AFTN AHEAD OF APPROACHING SYSTEM. WENT A
LITTLE WARMER THAN GUIDANCE ON MIN TEMPS TONIGHT IN KEEPING WITH
PREVIOUS FCST PACKAGE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT FOR MUCH OF THE PERIOD...ALTHOUGH
SOLUTIONS START TO DIVERGE MORE LATE. FORECAST CONFIDENCE ABOVE
AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR AT LEAST UNTIL LATE IN THE PERIOD. A
COLD FRONT WILL SWING THROUGH EARLY. MODEL TREND HAS BEEN FASTER
WITH THIS SYSTEM...SO WILL SPEED THINGS UP A BIT. WILL GO CAT POPS
ALL ZONES WED NIGHT...THEN LIKELY FAR NORTHEAST DOWN TO SLIGHT
CHANCE WEST FOR FIRST PART OF THURSDAY. DRY THU AFTERNOON.
INSTABILITY LOOKS WEAK AT BEST SO NO THUNDER MENTION AT THIS TIME.
HIGH PRESSURE WILL TAKE CONTROL BEHIND THE FRONT WITH DRYER AIR
MOVING IN. A WEAK COLD FRONT MAY SAG INTO THE REGION SAT OR SAT
NIGHT...BUT LITTLE MOISTURE OR FORCING SO WILL KEEP THE FORECAST
DRY. NEXT SYSTEM MAY APPROACH BY TUESDAY...BUT MODEL AGREEMENT POOR
AND CONSENSUS SEEMS TO HOLD PRECIP OFF UNTIL AFTER TUE...SO WILL
KEEP TUESDAY DRY FOR NOW. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM GFS MOS TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DRY AND VERY TRANQUIL FALL
WEATHER PATTERN CONTINUES AS AN UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE HOLDS
ACROSS THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION. SURFACE RIDGE ALSO LOCKED
IN PLACE FROM THE NE STATES TO DEEP SOUTH STATES. 

VARYING AMOUNTS OF HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TODAY...WHICH CURRENTLY WERE
QUITE THICK ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. ADJUSTED SKY COVER GRIDS UP
THROUGHOUT THE DAY...ALTHO THE HIGH CLOUDS MAY THIN OUT SOME IN THE
AFTERNOON. TEMPS GET OFF TO A MILD START THIS MORNING AND SHOULD
EASILY REACH THE GFS MOS MAXES GIVEN ANY SUNSHINE. 

FOR TONIGHT...SOME HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE TO STREAM ACROSS...
WHILE LOW LEVEL CLOUDS ARE PROGGED TO ADVECT NORTHWARD LATE TONIGHT.
THESE LOW CLOUDS SHOULD EASILY REACH THE CENTRAL AND SRN COUNTIES
OVERNIGHT...POSSIBLY AS FAR AS NE TN BEFORE 12Z WEDNESDAY. WENT
WITH THE MILDER MOS MINS AND EVEN A FEW DEGREES ABOVE WHERE CLOUDS
INCREASE THE MOST.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
THE MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE THE BROAD 
UPPER-TROUGH AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. MODELS HAVE 
HONED IN ON THE TIMING A LITTLE BETTER...INDICATING THE BEST CHANCE 
FOR PRECIPITATION TO BE LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
MORNING...BEFORE THE FRONT CLEARS THE REGION BY THURSDAY EVENING. 
GIVEN THIS...HAVE ADJUSTED POPS SLIGHTLY TO REFLECT THIS AND HAVE 
REMOVED ANY MENTIONABLE POPS AFTER 00Z FRIDAY. THEREAFTER...RIDGING 
BRIEFLY BUILDS IN FOR FRIDAY BEFORE ANOTHER WEAK FRONT MOVES THROUGH 
SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. HOWEVER...THERE WILL BE LIMITED MOISTURE 
AVAILABLE AND THUS DO NOT THINK PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE 
SUBSTANTIAL ATTM. A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS MAY BE POSSIBLE...BUT GIVEN 
THE UNCERTAINTY THIS FAR OUT...HAVE OPTED TO KEEP POPS SILENT FOR 
NOW.

HIGH PRESSURE CONTROLLING THE AREA/S WEATHER...AND WILL PROVIDE THE
ADVERTISED WARMING TREND THROUGH WEDNESDAY. SE WINDS NEAR CHA HAVE
BEEN AROUND 7-15 KTS TODAY BUT THIS SHOULD EASE A LITTLE FOR
TUESDAY. CIRRUS COMING IN AND OUT OF AREA WILL HAVE ITS USUAL
IMPACTS ON TEMPS. NAM/CANADIAN/ECMWF SUGGEST ISOLATED SHOWERS
POSSIBLE ALONG AND EAST OF THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS LATE
TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT HAVE LEFT OUT A MENTION FROM THE FCST FOR NOW.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
AT THE START OF THIS PERIOD THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM IS BEARING DOWN
ON THE AREA...WITH THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH STRETCHING FROM THE GREAT
LAKES SSWWD INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND AN INCREASING SWLY FLOW
ALOFT OVER OUR AREA. PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN MODELS THAT THE
FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA QUICKLY ON THURSDAY. RIGHT NOW IT
LOOKS LIKE THE POST-FRONTAL AIR WILL BE TOO DRY FOR UPSLOPE SNOWS
THURSDAY EVENING...SO WILL NOT INCLUDE ANY FLURRIES, ETC. AT THIS
TIME. WILL INCLUDE SOME LIGHT POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS THURSDAY
EVENING...BUT THAT IS ONLY TO ACCOUNT THE POSSIBILITY OF SLIGHTLY
SLOWER TIMING OVERALL--IF IT SLOWS DOWN...THE COLD AIR WOULD SLOW
DOWN AS WELL...SO JUST KEEPING THIS PRECIP AS RAIN SHOWERS. GOING
DRY WITH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST.

FOR TEMPS...FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT WENT SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN GUIDANCE 
OVER WESTERN AREAS AS CLOUDS AND INCREASING WINDS CUT DOWN ON 
RADIATIONAL COOLING.  WOULD HAVE GONE EVEN WARMER IN THOSE 
AREAS...BUT THE COLD FRONT COULD ARRIVE BEFORE END OF THIS OVERNIGHT 
PERIOD AND START COOLING THE AREA.  INSTABILITY WILL BE VERY 
WEAK...SO KEEPING PRECIP AS JUST SHOWERS.

WORDING. CHANCE FOR SHOWERS TOO LOW FOR MENTION. SON

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NW FLOW ALOFT AND SOME LINGERING 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL KEEP SOME AMOUNT OF CLOUDINESS ACROSS SW VA 
AND NE TN THIS MORNING. THIS MOISTURE IS LIMITED TO AROUND 925 TO 
850 MBS...AND FORECAST INSTABILITY IS ONLY 30 J/KG OR LESS UP TO 18Z 
TODAY. THUS...NO MENTION OF PRECIPITATION...BUT I WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED IF A FEW SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES ACCOMPANIED THE CLOUDS 
AFTER SUNRISE TO MID MORNING. 

WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION TODAY PLUS SOME CLOUDS EARLY FAVORS THE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER GFS MOS MAX TEMPS. CLEARING AND CHILLY TONIGHT WITH 
A LIGHT NORTH WINDS POSSIBLY CONTINUING OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...A WEAK 
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW COULD DEVELOP ACROSS THE PLATEAU AFTER 06Z 
TUESDAY. GFS MOS MINS REFLECTED THIS AND WERE FOLLOWED. 

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE

850 MBS...AND FORECAST INSTABILITY IS ONLY 30 J/KG OR LESS UP TO 18Z 
TODAY. THUS...NO MENTION OF PRECIPITATION...BUT I WOULD NOT BE 
SURPRISED IF A FEW SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES ACCOMPANIED THE CLOUDS 
AFTER SUNRISE TO MID MORNING. 

WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION TODAY PLUS SOME CLOUDS EARLY FAVORS THE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER GFS MOS MAX TEMPS. CLEARING AND CHILLY TONIGHT WITH 
A LIGHT NORTH WINDS POSSIBLY CONTINUING OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...A WEAK 
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW COULD DEVELOP ACROSS THE PLATEAU AFTER 06Z 
TUESDAY. GFS MOS MINS REFLECTED THIS AND WERE FOLLOWED.

MODELS SHOW THE MAIN AREA OF CONVECTION TO DEVELOP OVER NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND INTO THE

ISOLATED SHOWER TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS FRONT. A FEW SNOW FLURRIES
COULD BE POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DUE TO THE STEEP LAPSE

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
910 PM EDT THU OCT 31 2013

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID WEST AND MS 
RIVER VALLEY...GENERALLY STRETCHING FROM NEAR CHICAGO SOUTHWARD TO 
NEAR MEMPHIS AND SHREVEPORT. AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AIR MASS WAS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH AREA RADARS REVEALING SOME 
LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA OUT AHEAD OF SOME PRE- 
FRONTAL CONVECTIVE BANDS DEVELOPING OVER WEST TN. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT A STRONG 850 MB JET BETWEEN 55 AND 65 KT WILL SWING ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS TONIGHT...AND VAD WIND PROFILES FROM KMRX AND KHTX 
CONFIRM STRONG WINDS AROUND 50 KT AT 4000 FT ABOVE THE RADARS. IT 
APPEARS THE WIND DIRECTION WITH THIS 850 MB JET SHOULD HAVE ENOUGH 
OF A WESTERLY COMPONENT TO PREVENT ANY MOUNTAIN-WAVE-INDUCED 
ACCELERATION OF THE LOW-LEVEL WINDS. THUS...WILL CONTINUE WITH THE 
WIND ADVISORY WITH NO UPGRADE TO A WARNING FOR THE FOOTHILLS. MODELS 
INDICATE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
LATER THIS EVENING AS THE COLD FRONT APPROACHES. THUS...THINK THAT 
SOME STRONGER SHOWERS (OR TSTORMS) LATER THIS EVENING AND AFTER 
MIDNIGHT MAY BE ABLE TO PULL SOME OF THE STRONGER 850 MB WINDS DOWN 
INTO THE VALLEYS TO POSSIBLY PRODUCE WIND GUSTS UP TO 55 MPH.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE 
THIS EVENING TO INCREASE WIND SPEEDS IN ALL ZONES AND MENTION THE 
STRONGER WIND GUSTS WITH THE STRONGER SHOWERS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WILL BE MOVING INTO AN ACTIVE 
WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE SHORT TERM AS A STRONG COLD FRONT MOVES INTO 
THE REGION.  A STRONG 850MB JET WITH WINDS REACHING BETWEEN 50 AND 
70 KTS ACCOMPANYING THE FRONT WILL BEGIN TO EFFECT THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION THIS AFTERNOON INCREASING GUSTY WINDS AND SHOULD 
BRING ADVISORY CRITERIA WINDS TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  THE 
SOUTHERN FLOW WILL ALSO CARRY IN WARM TEMPERATURES FOR AN 
UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY WITH HIGHS ACROSS THE VALLEY REACHING INTO THE 
70S.  LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING...CONVECTION ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE FRONT WILL PUSH INTO THE AREA.  A WIDE BAND OF SHOWERS 
ALONG WITH A FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL MOVE IN FOR CATEGORICAL POPS BY 
00Z.  THESE STORMS COULD POTENTIALLY REACH INTO THE STRONG 850MB 
WINDS AND GENERATE STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WIND GUSTS.  WINDS 
WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVERNIGHT AS THE STRONGEST PART OF THE JET 
MOVES IN.  CURRENT NAM MODEL TRENDING TOWARD A MORE SOUTHERLY WIND 
FIELD.  IF THIS IS THE CASE...THIS MAY SET THE STAGE FOR A 
SIGNIFICANT WIND EVENT ACROSS THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS.  
HOWEVER...THE GFS CONTINUES TO HAVE A WESTERLY COMPONENT WHICH WOULD 
LIMIT MOUNTAIN WAVE CONDITIONS.  FOR NOW...WILL ONLY ISSUE A WIND 
ADVISORY BUT THIS MAY NEED TO BE UPGRADED TO A HIGH WIND WARNING IF 
CONDITIONS WARRANT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
OVERALL AND RUN TO RUN CONTINUITY HAS BEEN FAIRLY GOOD AT LEAST 
UNTIL LATE IN THE PERIOD. FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD IS ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. MAY BE SOME LINGERING 
SHOWERS BEHIND THE INITIAL FRONT FRIDAY...MAINLY EAST.  SHOULD BE 
DRY FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN UPPER TROUGH WILL DIG IN SATURDAY...AS 
COLDER AIR SURGES IN. WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS NORTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE 
CENTRAL ZONES SAT.  A FEW SHOWERS OR SNOW SHOWERS MAY LINGER FAR 
NORTHEAST ZONES INTO SATURDAY NIGHT...SO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
THERE...THEN DRY FOR SUNDAY AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN.  DRY WEATHER 
WITH A WARMING TREND EXPECTED INTO TUESDAY. MODELS HAVE SLOWED THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS KY AND WV TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. VORTICITY ADVECTION AHEAD OF THIS DISTURBANCE WILL INCREASE 
HIGH CLOUDS THROUGH THE EVENING...WITH POSITIVE TEMPERATURE AND 
MOISTURE ADVECTION BETWEEN 925-700 MB BUILDING OVERNIGHT. WHILE LIFT 
REMAINS FAIRLY WEAK IN OUR AREA...SATURATION TO NEAR 500 MB SHOULD 
PRODUCE SOME LIGHT QPF BETWEEN 06Z AND 15Z IN NORTHERN AREAS. MODELS 
ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT...AND SO POPS WILL BE RAISED TO LIKELY 
IN SW VA TONIGHT. WITH THE SYSTEM TO THE EAST AND A BUILDING 
RIDGE...POPS WILL END IN THE AFTERNOON WITH DECREASING CLOUDS. TEMPS 
WILL BE QUITE MILD IN THE WARM SECTOR WITH A SW FLOW...WITH HIGHS IN 
THE 70S IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH THE MAIN FEATURE AFFECTING THE FORECAST 
AREA BEING A COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY NIGHT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT A VERY STRONG WIND FIELD (850 MB WINDS OF 65 TO 75 
KT) WILL DEVELOP OVER THE TN AND OHIO RIVER VALLEYS AHEAD OF THIS 
COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. IN FACT...WITH A 
STABLE AIR MASS LOCATED OVER THE MOUNTAINS...IT APPEARS THAT A 
MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT MIGHT DEVELOP IN THE WESTERN FOOTHILLS...BUT 
RIGHT NOW THE MODELS ARE INDICATING MORE OF A SOUTHWESTERLY WIND 
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT INSTEAD OF WINDS FROM THE MORE 
MOUNTAIN-WAVE-CONDUCIVE SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION. GFS MODEL CONTINUES 
TO REVEAL VERY HIGH HELICITY VALUES (AROUND 1000 M2/S2) OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT THE AMOUNT OF 
FORECASTED INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS WEAK. LATEST 
GFS AND CMC MODEL RUNS ARE FASTER THAN THE NAM AND ECMWF MODELS WITH 
THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE PRE- FRONTAL CONVECTION ON 
THURSDAY...BUT WOULD THINK THAT THE AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
WOULD SUPPORT A LATER ARRIVAL FOR THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...DO NOT 
EXPECT ANY PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION TO ARRIVE IN EAST TN UNTIL AFTER 
SUNSET ON THURSDAY NIGHT. RIGHT NOW...IT APPEARS THAT THE LOCAL AIR 
MASS WILL ONLY BE WEAKLY UNSTABLE (AT BEST) ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS 
IT ARRIVES THURSDAY NIGHT...SO WILL EMPHASIZE SHOWERS MORE THAN 
TSTORMS IN THE FORECAST. HOWEVER...WITH THE STRONG WIND SHEAR 
EXPECTED AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT...IT WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT TO CREATE DAMAGING WINDS AND A FEW ISOLATED 
TORNADOES OVER THE FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN 
PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY...WITH A FEW UPSLOPE RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. HIGH PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...BRINGING DRY AND TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

239 AM EDT TUE OCT 29 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
EXTEND INTO THE AREA TODAY.  SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL SKIRT 
NORTHERN AREAS TONIGHT. SHOULD BE DRY TODAY WITH JUST SOME CLOUDS 
AROUND...THEN SOME SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY NORTH 
TONIGHT. FORCING EXPECTED TO BE WEAK SO JUST SOME LOW CHANCE POPS 
FAR NORTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE INTO CENTRAL AREAS. MAV TEMPS LOOK 
REASONABLE OVERALL...SO JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A WARM FRONT WILL BE LIFTING 
NORTH ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY.  MOISTURE 
AND LIFT LIMITED WITH THIS FEATURE AND WILL KEEP POPS AT 20 TO 30 
OVER THE EFFECTED AREAS.  THE FRONT WILL LIFT NORTH AND OUT OF THE 
MRX CWA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  MAIN CONCERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED WILL 
BE A STRONG COLD FRONT PUSHING THROUGH THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT.  A 
STRONG 850MB JET WITH WINDS OF 60 TO 70 KTS IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
FRONT.  AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON THURSDAY...WINDS WILL BEGIN TO 
INCREASE AND SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL MOVE IN.  WITH THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE THURSDAY NIGHT...WIND WILL SIGNIFICANTLY INCREASE... 
ESPECIALLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  A WIND ADVISORY OR WARNING MAY BE 
NEED.  INSTABILITY WILL BE MINIMAL WITH THE MAIN LINE OF CONVECTION 
JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT...HOWEVER...WITH THE STRONG WIND FIELD... 
VERY HIGH HELICITY WILL DEVELOP OVER THE AREA.  THIS MAY ALLOW FOR 
THE POTENTIAL OF ISOLATED SUPERCELLS.  THE SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH 
RATHER QUICKLY.  SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL LINGER INTO FRIDAY WITH AN 
UPPER TROUGH MOVING IN LATE FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND.  FLOW ALOFT 
WILL EVENTUALLY TURN NORTHWESTERLY...HOWEVER...MOISTURE BECOMES 
QUITE LIMITED BY THIS POINT AND DO NO EXPECT UPSLOPE PRECIP AT THIS 
TIME.  SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN ON SUNDAY AND WILL BE THE MAIN 
INFLUENCE OF AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE REST OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE OFF 
TO OUR EAST THIS EVENING. WILL DROP ALL POPS BY 00Z EXPECT FOR A 
PORTION OF SW VA WHICH WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE UP UNTIL 04Z. CLOUDS 
SHOULD SLOWLY BEGIN TO DISSIPATE OVERNIGHT FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST AS THE SHORT WAVE MOVES FURTHER EAST...BUT MOST AREAS 
SHOULD STILL STAY PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY. NORTHEAST TN AND SW VA 
WILL HANG ON TO CLOUD COVER THE LONGEST WITH ONLY PARTIAL CLEARING 
COMING BY 09-12Z TOMORROW MORNING. PATCHY FOG IS POSSIBLE 
OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS ANY AREAS THAT SAW RAIN TODAY. OVER 
NIGHT LOWS SHOULD BE ROUGHLY 5 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL DUE TO CLOUD 
COVER. TOMORROW SHOULD BE A BETTER DAY WEATHER WISE WITH A DRY 
FORECAST IN PLACE...THOUGH SOME CLOUDS WILL STILL BE IN PLACE DUE TO 
A WEAK WAVE OF ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE FLOW TO THE NORTH OF OUR 
AREA. HIGHS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL TOMORROW DUE TO A 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AT 850MB DEVELOPING BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WITH THE MAIN FEATURE BEING A COLD FRONT ON THURSDAY NIGHT. 
BEFOREHAND...A WARM FRONT IS PROGGED TO BE LOCATED AROUND SOUTHWEST 
VA AND NORTHEAST TN ON WEDNESDAY...WITH SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT 
EXPECTED TO CREATE A FEW SHOWERS ALONG IT. THE GFS AND NAM MODELS 
HAVE SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE EXACT LOCATION OF THIS WARM 
FRONT...AND THUS...HOW MUCH RAINFALL WILL AFFECT SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN. FOR NOW...WILL MENTION SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THESE 
AREAS ON WEDNESDAY...WITH THIS WARM FRONT EXPECTED TO MOVE NORTH OF 
THE FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...ENDING THE CHANCES FOR RAIN 
TEMPORARILY. MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT THAT A COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH A 
VERY STRONG WIND FIELD DEVELOPING ALONG IT. IN FACT...THE GFS MODEL 
REVEALS VERY HIGH HELICITY VALUES OVER THE FORECAST AREA (IN EXCESS 
OF 1000 M2/S2) ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT THE AMOUNT OF 
INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS IN QUESTION SINCE THE 
BULK OF THE PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION APPEARS TO NOT ARRIVE IN EAST TN 
UNTIL AFTER SUNSET. RIGHT NOW...THE LOCAL AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO BE 
FAIRLY STABLE AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...WITH ONLY A WEAKLY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS EXPECTED OVER THE FORECAST AREA ALONG THE COLD FRONT. 
HOWEVER...WITH THE STRONG WIND SHEAR EXPECTED AHEAD OF THIS COLD 
FRONT...IT WOULD NOT TAKE MUCH INSTABILITY TO CREATE A FEW 
SUPERCELLS AND THE POSSIBILITY OF AN ISOLATED TORNADO. AN AMPLIFIED 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH THEN SWINGS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND SATURDAY...BUT THE GFS MODEL INDICATES ONLY A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN CLOUDS WITH IT OVER THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH PRESSURE 
THEN BUILDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...BRINGING 
DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE 
GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS 
THE REGION TODAY. LOOKS LIKE BEST COVERAGE OF PRECIP WILL BE 
NORTH...SO WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS NORTH AND CHANCE ELSEWHERE.  
FORCING NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE SO PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE ON THE 
LIGHT SIDE.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH EARLY TONIGHT FOR 
ANY LINGERING SHOWERS...OTHERWISE EXPECT GRADUAL DRYING.  SOME FOG 
WILL LIKELY DEVELOP OVERNIGHT SO WILL INCLUDE PATCHY FOG FOR AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE FOR TODAY...BUT WILL GENERALLY 
BUMP UP A BIT FOR LOWS TONIGHT.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE MODELS CONTINUE TO COME 
INTO BETTER AGREEMENT ON THURSDAY'S STORM SYSTEM. HEIGHTS WILL BE ON 
THE RISE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF THE WESTERN STATES UPPER 
TROUGH LEADING TO INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE AND A MOST PLEASANT 
WARMING TREND. AS THE WARM AIR ADVANCES ON GRADUALLY STRENGTHENING 
LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW...THERE WILL BE A SMALL CHANCE FOR A SHOWER 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA CLOSE TO A WARM 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE WARM FRONT SHOULD MOVE NORTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY ENDING THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS. POPS 
WILL INCREASE DURING THE DAY THURSDAY AS THE UPPER TROUGH BUILDS 
INTO THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. HOWEVER...THE BEST CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL 
BE THURSDAY NIGHT WHEN THE STORM SYSTEM COLD FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE 
MID SOUTH. THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A STRONG UPPER LEVEL JET 
BUILDING IN WITH THE TROUGH BUT SIGNIFICANT INSTABILITY APPEARS TO 
BE LIMITED TO THE DEEP SOUTH. THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE IN THE RRQ 
OF THE UPPER JET WITH DECENT CONVERGENCE ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
SO CONVECTION LOOKS LIKE A GOOD BET BUT THE STRENGTH OF THE 
CONVECTION IS STILL IN QUESTION. WE WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THIS 
DEVELOPING SYSTEM FOR THE POTENTIAL OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS. POPS 
DROPS OFF QUICKLY BEHIND THE FRONT ON FRIDAY AND COOLER AIR BUILDS 
INTO THE REGION HOWEVER...THE STRONGEST COLD AIR ADVECTION MAY NOT 
DEVELOP UNTIL SATURDAY AS TRAILING ENERGY DROPS INTO THE BACK SIDE 
OF THE MEAN EASTERN U.S. TROUGH. ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR A 
SHOWER OR TWO ACROSS MAINLY THE HIGHER TERRAIN IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA

A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH EVIDENT IN SATELLITE IMAGERY OVER 
AR WILL BE MOVING TOWARD OUR AREA TONIGHT. MOISTURE DEPTH WILL BE 
INCREASING THROUGH THE EVENING...WITH QG FORCING PROVIDING LIFT 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. WE SHOULD BEGIN TO SEE SOME SHOWERS ENTERING 
SOUTHERN AREAS AROUND 06Z-09Z...SPREADING NORTHWARD OVERNIGHT. QPF 
LOOKS LIGHT AS LIFT IS NOT VERY STRONG. POPS BEGIN TO TAPER OFF 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON AS THE SYSTEM MOVES EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. 
WILL END ALL POPS BY 00Z TUESDAY AS MIDLEVELS DRY OUT. MODELS KEEP 
PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IN PLACE MONDAY NIGHT BEHIND THE
SYSTEM.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH MONDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
OVERALL...NO BIG CHANGES TO THE LONG TERM FORECAST. MODELS IN A
LITTLE BETTER AGREEMENT ON TIMING OF LARGE PLAINS SYSTEM AT THE END
OF WEEK WITH A WARMING TREND CONTINUING UNTIL FRONT PUSHES THROUGH.

A WARM FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGE PLAINS SYSTEM WILL LIFT NORTH 
THROUGH OUR AREA SOMETIME ON TUESDAY AFTERNOON/WEDNESDAY MORNING.  
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN PLACE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. AN INCREASE 
IN CLOUD COVER WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT ALONG WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR SOME LIGHT SHOWERS MAINLY FOR OUR NORTHERN AREAS. NO POPS IN 
PLACE FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE WARM FRONT WILL BE WELL NORTH OF 
OUR AREA. BY THURSDAY THE FLOW HAS BECOME LARGELY AMPLIFIED AS THE 
SYSTEM TO OUR WEST IS APPROACHING. 

MODELS STILL HAVE TIMING ISSUES BUT ARE CLOSER TOGETHER THAN THEY 
WERE YESTERDAY. LATEST GFS BRINGS IN PRECIP TO THE PLATEAU AROUND 18Z 
ON THURSDAY WHILE THE ECMWF WAITS UNTIL AROUND 00Z ON FRIDAY. WILL 
CONTINUE TO GO WITH A BLEND OF BOTH MODELS FOR TIMING BUT WILL PUT 
MORE WEIGHT INTO THE ECMWF. THE FRONT SHOULD PUSH THROUGH THE AREA 
SOMETIME BETWEEN THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THE POSSIBILITY 
OF THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE FRONT STILL EXISTS. IT STILL REMAINS TO 
BE SEEN HOW MUCH IF ANY CAPE WE WILL HAVE TO WORK WITH...SHEAR 
HOWEVER WILL BE PLENTIFUL DUE TO A STRONG 300MB AND 850MB JET IN PLACE. 
MADE SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO POPS WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE BUT 
NOTHING MAJOR. HAVE LIKELY POPS IN PLACE FOR EVERYONE BY 03Z ON 
FRIDAY AND KEEP THEM UP UNTIL 12Z FRIDAY. AFTER 12Z FRIDAY LIKELY 
POPS REMAIN IN PLACE FOR THE FAR EASTERN AREAS WITH CHANCE 
EVERYWHERE ELSE. MOST PLACES WILL BE DRY BY 00Z SATURDAY BUT LEFT 
SLIGHT CHANCE IN FOR FAR EASTERN AREAS UNTIL 12Z SATURDAY MORNING. 

ANOTHER WAVE OF ENERGY SWINGS THROUGH ON SATURDAY BEHIND THE 
DEPARTED COLD FRONT RE-DEEPENING THE TROUGH BASE OVER OUR AREA. DUE 
TO DRIER AIR IN PLACE BEHIND THE FRONT...KEPT THE FORECAST DRY FOR 
SATURDAY AT THIS TIME. A BRIEF NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN SETS UP 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING DUE TO THE RE-DEEPENING OF 
THE TROUGH BASE AND WILL ALLOW FOR GUSTY WINDS ACROSS THE AREA. A 
MORE ZONAL FLOW RETURNS BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON AS THE TROUGH PUSHES OFF

SPRINKLES TONIGHT.  WILL INCLUDE A  SLIGHT CHANCE POP ALL ZONES.  
MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL SO WILL STAY CLOSE. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS IN A LITTLE BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH A WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH PROGGED TO MOVE EAST ACROSS 
THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. ON MONDAY. THERE COULD BE ENOUGH MOISTURE AND 
JUST ENOUGH ISENTROPIC LIFT FOR A SMALL CHANCE OF A LIGHT SHOWER ON 
MONDAY WITH THIS WEAK SYSTEM SO ADDED POPS HERE. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL 
BE IN TRANSITION TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AS THE PATTERN BECOMES 
HIGHLY AMPLIFIED WITH A DEEPENING WESTERN STATES TROUGH AND BUILDING 
HEIGHTS OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. IN THE WARM AIR ADVECTION 
PATTERN STRENGTHENING AHEAD OF THE WESTERN TROUGH MODELS ARE 
INDICATING THE POSSIBILITY OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE NORTHERN PART OF 
THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. KEPT POPS IN THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE CATEGORY AT THIS TIME WITH BEST WARM FRONTAL LIFT WEST 
OF THE APPALACHIAN REGION. FOR THE BIG LATE WORK WEEK STORM SYSTEM 
THE MODELS STILL HAVE TIMING ISSUES WITH THE GFS ABOUT SIX HOURS 
FASTER THAN THE ECMWF/CMC. ONCE AGAIN STAYED WITH THE PREVIOUS 
FORECAST IDEOLOGY WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH THE SLOWER MODELS. THIS 
MEANS ONLY A SMALL CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ON THURSDAY WITH THE MAIN 
FRONTAL PUSH AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA LATER THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY MORNING. MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW THE POSSIBILITY OF 
CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM COLD FRONT WITH RELATIVELY STRONG 
SHEAR BUT LIMITED BUOYANCY FOR THE EVENT. WENT AHEAD AND TWEAKED 
POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS UP TO THE LIKELY CATEGORY FROM 
06Z THROUGH 15Z FRIDAY. GRADUALLY TAPERED POPS BACK ON FRIDAY WITH 
DRIER AIR BUILDING IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT. MAINTAINED A 
DRY FORECAST FOR SATURDAY AT THIS TIME...ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS THERE 
MAY BE SOME TRAILING ENERGY AND MOISTURE AVAILABLE IN THE NORTHWEST 
FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. 
ON SATURDAY.

319 PM EDT SAT OCT 26 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
AN AREA OF ISENTROPIC LIFT AT THE 295K LEVEL IS PRODUCING SOME 
CLOUDS ACROSS KY INTO MIDDLE TN. THESE CLOUDS WILL MOVE INTO OUR 
AREA TOWARD EVENING...AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE NIGHT. THIS SHOULD 
HOLD LOW TEMPS UP BY QUITE A BIT OVER LAST NIGHT...MAINLY IN THE 
UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S. THE LAYER OF MOISTURE IS ONLY ABOUT 100 MB 
DEEP AT BEST...AND LIFT WILL NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PRODUCE 
MEASURABLE PRECIP...ALTHOUGH A FEW SPRINKLES CANNOT BE RULED OUT 
ENTIRELY. THE AREA OF ISENTROPIC LIFT AND MOISTURE GETS PUSHED 
SOUTHWARD TOMORROW...AND WE SHOULD SEE CLOUDS DECREASING FROM NORTH 
TO SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY. THUS...THE TEMPS FOR TOMORROW WILL BE 
TRICKY. WENT ON THE WARM SIDE OF MOS NORTH WHERE MORE SUNSHINE IS 
EXPECTED...AND ON THE COOL SIDE SOUTH WHERE CLOUDS WILL LAST LATER 
IN THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
TEMPERATURES WILL BE ON THE RISE THROUGH THE EXTENDED BEFORE A
STRONG SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS OUR AREA NEAR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK.

A MOSTLY ZONAL FLOW WILL BE IN PLACE SUNDAY NIGHT WITH A WEAK WAVE 
JUST TO OUR SOUTH...CENTERED OVER MISSISSIPPI AND ALABAMA. THIS 
PASSING FEATURE SHOULDN'T BRING MORE THAN PERHAPS SOME ADDED CLOUDS 
ACROSS OUR SOUTHERN AREAS AS MOISTURE AND LIFT ARE LACKING. MONDAY 
LOOKS PLEASANT WITH NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES 
AS ZONAL FLOW CONTINUES. CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE THROUGHOUT 
THE DAY ON TUESDAY AS A WARM FRONT TO OUR SOUTH BEGINS TO APPROACH 
THE AREA. THE WARM FRONT IS ASSOCIATED WITH THE LARGE PLAINS SYSTEM 
TO OUR WEST. MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT THE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH DURING THE TUESDAY EVENING/WEDNESDAY MORNING TIME-FRAME. THE 
WARMING TREND PEAKS ON WEDNESDAY WITH TEMPS A FEW DEGREES ABOVE 
NORMAL. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN PLACE FOR WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH BUT NOT EXPECTING MUCH AS THE 
LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE WARM FRONT ISN'T ALL THAT STRONG. 

ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT/THURSDAY THE FLOW BECOMES LARGELY AMPLIFIED IN 
RESPONSE TO THE APPROACHING PLAINS SYSTEM. STRONG RIDING RESIDES 
OVER THE ENTIRE EASTERN U.S. WITH A DEEP TROUGH ACROSS THE PLAINS. 
AS WITH THE PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...ALL OF THE MODELS AGREE THAT A 
STRONG SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS OUR AREA BUT THE TIMING ISN'T AGREED 
UPON. THE 12Z GFS IS A LITTLE SLOWER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS BUT IT IS 
STILL THE QUICKEST SOLUTION. THE GFS WANTS TO BRING THE SYSTEM IN ON 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING AND HAVE IT OUT OF OUR AREA BY 12Z 
FRIDAY. THE CANADIAN AND ECMWF AGREE ON A SLOWER SOLUTION AND DON'T 
BRING IT IN UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT/MORNING. THE ECMWF DOESN'T GET THE 
SYSTEM OUT OF OUR AREA UNTIL 12Z SATURDAY. DUE TO THE LARGE AMOUNT 
OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THE TIMING...I CHOSE TO GO WITH A COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF. WILL BRING IN CHANCE POPS TO ALL AREAS BY 
00Z FRIDAY AND KEEP THEM THROUGH 00Z SATURDAY. FROM 00Z SATURDAY UP 
UNTIL 12Z SATURDAY WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS ONLY FOR FAR EASTERN AREAS 
WITH A DROP OF POPS FOR ALL AREAS AT 12Z ON SATURDAY. TIMING OF 
PRECIP WILL HAVE TO BE ADJUSTED AS MODELS CONTINUE TO RESOLVE THIS 
SYSTEM. 

THUNDERSTORMS ARE ALSO POSSIBLE WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE AS DEEP 
MOISTURE/STRONG LIFT/AND SHEAR WILL ALL BE IN PLACE. AS OF NOW...IT 
LOOKS LIKE THIS COULD BE A HIGH SHEAR/LOW CAPE SETUP. SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW INCREASES ON THURSDAY ALLOWING FOR GULF MOISTURE TO BE PULLED 
INTO THE AREA. THERE WILL LIKELY BE STRONG CONVERGENCE ALONG THE COLD 
FRONT ALLOWING FOR FRONTOGENETIC FORCING. THE AMOUNT OF 
INSTABILITY...IF ANY...IS STILL UNCERTAIN DUE TO THE UNCERTAIN 
TIMING OF THE SYSTEM. A 120KT 300MB JET AND 60KT 850MB JET WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE FRONT AND ALLOW FOR ROBUST SHEAR.

THINGS COOL BACK DOWN A BIT AFTER THE FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH HIGHS IN 
THE UPPER 50S NORTH AND LOW TO MID 60S SOUTH.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION WILL 
GIVE WAY TO A WEAKENING AND MOISTURE STARVED COLD FRONT THAT WILL 
PUSH IN TONIGHT.  CURRENT FREEZE WARNING WILL BE ALLOWED TO STAY AS 
IS...AND IT APPEARS THAT IT WILL LIKELY BE COLD ENOUGH THIS MORNING 
TO END THE FALL FREEZE PROGRAM FOR THOSE AREAS STILL IN IT.  WILL 
SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS LATER TODAY INTO TONIGHT. THE MOISTURE 
WILL BE SHALLOW AND FORCING WEAK...SO AT THIS POINT WILL KEEP THE 
FORECAST PRECIP FREE.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL SO WILL 
STAY CLOSE.    

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ONCE AGAIN MODELS ARE CLOSE 
WITH DEPICTION OF EXPECTED WEATHER DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD BUT THE GFS AND CANADIAN START TO OUTPACE THE ECMWF 
WITH A PLAINS STORM SYSTEM LATE IN THE WORK WEEK. HOWEVER...ALL 
MODELS AGREE THAT THE PATTERN WILL BECOME AMPLIFIED WITH A 
STRENGTHENING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THE STRONG SYSTEM. THIS 
WILL LEAD TO A NICE WARMING TREND THROUGH THE WEEK. INITIALLY THERE 
WILL BE A FEW CLOUDS AROUND ON SUNDAY AS A WEAK PERTURBATION 
CURRENTLY PRESSING INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...AND A WEAKENING 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. I DON'T 
BELIEVE THIS SYSTEM WILL BE ABLE TO GENERATE MUCH MORE THAN A PERIOD 
OF SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUDS SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. HOWEVER...THERE 
WILL BE A SMALL CHANCE FOR A SHOWER TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS 
WARMER AIR IS LIFTED OVER THE RETREATING LOW LEVEL AIRMASS. AN 
INCREASING CHANCE FOR SHOWERS WILL BE SEEN LATER IN THE DAY THURSDAY 
INTO THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE PLAINS SYSTEM DRIVES EAST INTO THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THE STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL PULL 
INCREASINGLY MOIST AIR INTO THE REGION. STRONG LIFT IN THE PRESENCE 
OF A POWERFUL UPPER JET AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ALONG THE COLD 
FRONT WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE LATE 
WORK WEEK TIME FRAME. STAYED CLOSER TO THE SLOWER ECMWF SOLUTION 
WHICH DOESN'T BRING THE FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL FRIDAY. 
GRADUALLY DROPPED POPS LATER IN THE DAY THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS AS 
THE BOUNDARY MOVES ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER THE AREA TONIGHT...WHILE AN 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL BE DEPARTING TO THE EAST WITH A DRY NW FLOW 
BEHIND. WITH CALM WINDS AND CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT...WE SHOULD SEE LOW 
TEMPS IN THE 20S JUST ABOUT EVERYWHERE...WHICH WILL LIKELY BRING AN 
END TO THE FREEZE PROGRAM FOR THE SEASON. THE FREEZE WARNING IN 
EFFECT FOR TONIGHT WILL BE ONLY FOR THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY 
AREAS...AS ALL OTHER AREAS HAVE ALREADY SEEN A HARD FREEZE.

A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BE APPROACHING THE AREA ON SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON. MOISTURE IS LIMITED TO A VERY THIN LAYER AROUND 850-750 
MB...AND WILL ONLY SERVE TO BRING INCREASING CLOUDS LATE IN THE DAY. 
HIGHS WILL BE IN THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THIS PERIOD STARTS WITH 
AN UPPER TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA AND THE GREAT LAKES THAT EXTENDS 
SOUTHWARD TOWARD OUR AREA...AND A WEAK UPPER RIDGE OVER THE WESTERN 
U.S. STATES.  THIS PATTERN SLOWLY MORPHS OVER THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS 
AS THE TROUGH LIFTS TO THE NORTHEAST AND A CUTOFF LOW MOVES INTO THE 
WESTERN STATES FROM THE PACIFIC. BY EARLY TO MID NEXT WEEK...THIS 
INDUCES WEAK UPPER RIDGING OVER OUR AREA.  AS THE CUTOFF LOW HEADS 
EASTWARD LATE NEXT WEEK...OUR RIDGE GETS PUSHED TO THE EAST...THE 
UPPER FLOW BACKS...AND A COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO THE AREA.  
TIMING IS THE BIG ISSUE...WILL FOLLOW CONSENSUS WISDOM OF GOING 
SLOWER THAN THE GFS SOLUTION...WHICH KEEPS THINGS MOSTLY DRY THROUGH 
MUCH OF NEXT WEEK.

WITH THIS SLOWER PROGRESSION FOR EVERYTHING...AM KEEPING POPS 
GENERALLY DRIER THROUGH MID WEEK...AND WILL KEEP LOW TEMPS A LITTLE 
COOLER INTO MID WEEK...AND ONCE THE HIGHER DEW POINTS SWELL INTO THE 
AREA....WILL HOLD ONTO THEM THURSDAY NIGHT.  HAVE HIGHER POPS COMING 
IN FINALLY...OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF DAYS.  THIS SYSTEM LOOKS PRETTY 
DYNAMIC...BUT THIS MODEL RUN LOOKS LIKE THE UPPER FLOW IS POSITIVELY 
TILTED...SO MAY JUST HAVE A LINE OF STORMS...OR POSSIBLY SHOWERS IF 
IN THE MIDDLE OF THE NIGHT...COME ROLLING THROUGH THE AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BE PASSING THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT. AHEAD 
OF THE TROUGH...THE NAM SHOWS MOISTURE EXTENDING UP TO ABOUT 750 MB 
WITH STEEP LAPSE RATES IN NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. THE GFS IS 
DRIER. WILL CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP NORTH TO ACCOUNT FOR THE 
NAM...BUT ANY PRECIP CHANCE WILL END BY 06Z. 

TEMPERATURES WILL FALL INTO THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S ACROSS THE 
AREA. THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND CENTRAL-SOUTHERN VALLEY LOCATIONS 
REMAIN IN THE FREEZE PROGRAM...AND SO THE FREEZE WARNING WILL BE 
CONTINUED FOR THESE AREAS. ON FRIDAY WE WILL SEE CLEARING SKIES AS A 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA. HOWEVER COLD TEMPS WILL 
CONTINUE WITH A DEEP NW FLOW...AS HIGHS WILL BE IN THE 40S NORTH TO 
LOWER 50S SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
ANOTHER COLD NIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE SETTLES OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA AND UPPER TROUGH MOVES TO THE EAST COAST. ADJUSTED 
LOWS SLIGHTLY UPWARD. LOWS STILL LOOK TO BE IN THE MID 20S TO NEAR 
30 SO AREAS THAT DO NOT FREEZE TONIGHT WILL LIKELY HAVE A LIGHT TO 
HARD FREEZE BY SATURDAY MORNING. A FREEZE WARNING MAY NEED TO BE 
REPEATED FOR PART OF THE AREA ONCE AGAIN. FROM SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST WITH ZONAL FLOW ALOFT. HIGHS 
SATURDAY 5 TO 10 DEGREES WARMER AND WINDS BECOME SW. SATURDAY NIGHT 
LOWS MOSTLY IN THE 30S TO LOWER 40S AND ABOVE FREEZING EXCEPT 
COLDEST VALLEYS AND HIGH ELEVATIONS.

A WEAKENING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT 
AND SUNDAY WITH SOME CLOUDS BUT NO PRECIPITATION. SUNDAY AND MONDAY 
SLIGHTLY WARMER EACH DAY WITH LOWS SIMILAR TO SUNDAY. WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE REMAINS OVER THE TN VALLEY AND APPALACHIANS MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY BUT SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER THE CENTRAL STATES WILL SPREAD 
CLOUDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA AT TIMES. WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY THE 
FORECAST BECOMES MORE UNCERTAIN AS ECMWF BRINGS IN A WEAK SYSTEM 
WEDNESDAY THEN DEVELOPS A STRONGER SYSTEM THURSDAY WHICH COULD 
APPROACH THE REGION THURSDAY EVENING. AT THE SAME TIME THE GFS 
DEVELOPS ONE SYSTEM TO THE NORTH WEDNESDAY AND A TRAILING SOUTHERN 
SYSTEM INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY THAT 
MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE LAST 24 HOURS OF THE 
EXTENDED. SO WILL INTRODUCE RAIN CHANCES WEST TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY AND INCREASE CHANCES FOR ALL AREAS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY WITH THUNDER POSSIBLE THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY MILD 
AT NIGHT AND NEAR AVERAGE DURING THE DAYTIME.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN CONCERN IS THE EXPECTED
FREEZING TEMPERATURES ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA TONIGHT. FOR THIS
MORNING...A WIDESPREAD FREEZE IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SMOKY MOUNTAINS. INCOMING CLOUD COVER THIS MORNING
WILL LIKELY LIMIT THE AREAL EXTENT OF THE FREEZE ACROSS SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA..NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.

ANOTHER WEAK SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEYS
TODAY AND THIS EVENING WITH A GOOD DEAL OF MID/LOW CLOUDS TODAY...
THEN DECREASING TONIGHT. THIS WAVE WILL PULL COLDER AIR INTO THE
REGION WITH TEMPERATURES DROPPING AT OR BELOW FREEZING OVER MOST
LOCATIONS TONIGHT. HAVE ISSUED ANOTHER FREEZE WARNING ACROSS THE
AREA..EXCEPT THE FAR NORTHEAST/CENTRAL MOUNTAINS.

BESIDES THE COLD TEMPERATURES..UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE MOUNTAINS WILL
PRODUCE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING. NO ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND 
GENERALLY REVEAL A PATTERN CHANGE WITH A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION GRADUALLY BEING REPLACED BY A 
HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE 
NATION. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH A HARD FREEZE EXPECTED OVER THE 
ENTIRE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY MORNING. A RAPID WARMING TREND WILL 
THEN DEVELOP FOR THE REST OF THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...AS A 
DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THIS HIGH BRINGS TEMPS ABOVE 
NORMAL BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. A COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON TUESDAY NIGHT...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE NATION. AN EXTENSIVE 
AREA OF CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
WITH THIS COLD FRONT...BUT WILL JUST MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH A STABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED. THIS 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO EVENTUALLY DEVELOP A 
STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY BY WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...AND IS CURRENTLY PROGGED TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA WITH 
POSSIBLE STRONG CONVECTION ON HALLOWEEN (OUTSIDE OF THE FORECAST 
PERIOD). AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH

253 PM EDT WED OCT 23 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
STRATOCU OVER THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON IS EXPECTED TO DISSIPATE WITH 
SUNSET AS WE SEE STABILIZATION FROM WARMING 500 MB TEMPS AND 850 MB 
TEMP ADVECTION BECOMING NEARLY NEUTRAL. HOWEVER...MIDLEVEL CLOUDS 
ASSOCIATED WITH A 700 MB VORT MAX SEEN IN SATELLITE OVER THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS WILL BE MOVING IN TONIGHT. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM SHOW 
MOISTURE INCREASING AFTER MIDNIGHT AROUND THE 700 MB LEVEL. THIS 
WILL HAVE SOME IMPACT ON OUR LOW TEMPERATURES...ADDING UNCERTAINTY 
TO THE CURRENT FROST/FREEZE PRODUCTS. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WARM SIDE 
OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR LOW TEMPS...WHICH STILL PUTS MOST OF THE 
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL VALLEY IN A FROST ADVISORY...WITH A FREEZE WARNING 
NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. WILL CONTINUE THE FROST ADVISORY AND 
FREEZE WARNING AREAS UNCHANGED. 

ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSES THE AREA...BUT 
IT WILL HAVE LIMITED MOISTURE TO WORK WITH. THE NAM...SREF...AND 
CANADIAN PRODUCE LIGHT PRECIP IN THE NORTHERN HALF...WHILE THE GFS 
HAS PRECIP JUST NORTH OF OUR AREA. STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES IN 
THE NAM SOUNDING COULD PRODUCE SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS. WILL INCLUDE A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR NORTHERN AND CENTRAL AREAS IN THE AFTERNOON. 
WITH LIMITED SUNSHINE...HIGHS TOMORROW WILL AGAIN BE IN THE 50S.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
A WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL SLIDE THROUGH THE AREA...MAINLY EFFECTING
NORTHERN LOCATIONS THURSDAY EVENING. LIMITED MOISTURE AND WEAK LIFT
WILL ONLY ALLOW FOR A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS. AS COOLER AIR CONTINUES
TO FILTER INTO THE REGION...THE LIGHT SHOWERS MAY TRANSITION INTO A
FEW POCKETS OF LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS
THURSDAY NIGHT. NO ACCUMULATIONS AREA ARE EXPECTED. HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDS IN ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY FOR DRY CONDITIONS. HOWEVER...WITH
A COLD AIR MASS CONTINUING TO PUSH IN...OVERNIGHT LOWS SHOULD DROP
BELOW FREEZING ACROSS MUCH OF THE MRX CWA FRIDAY NIGHT. A FREEZE
WARNING WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED...ESPECIALLY FOR AREAS THAT HAVE YET
TO SEE FREEZING TEMPERATURES. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE IN ON
SUNDAY BUT MODELS SHOW LITTLE MOISTURE OR DYNAMICS AND WILL KEEP
THINGS DRY FOR NOW. ZONAL FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPS OVER THE REGION
MONDAY AND TUESDAY. A SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH TO OUR NORTH TUESDAY
INTO WEDNESDAY. ISOLATED SHOWERS MAY REACH INTO OUR AREA BY TUESDAY
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WITH BEST CHANCES ACROSS NORTHERN LOCATIONS.

1001 AM EDT WED OCT 23 2013

.DISCUSSION...
THE GENERAL FORECAST TREND IS ON TRACK...BUT MINOR CHANGES WILL BE
MADE TO REMOVE AFTERNOON POPS. CURRENT RADAR TRENDS SHOW THE LIGHT
SHOWERS IN SW VA EXITING SOON...AND WE WILL SEE MIDLEVEL
STABILIZATION THROUGH THE DAY AS THE 500 MB TROUGH MOVES EAST. 850
MB COLD ADVECTION IS PRODUCING SOME BROKEN TO OVERCAST STRATOCU TO
OUR WEST AND INTO THE PLATEAU. SOME DOWNSLOPE OFF THE PLATEAU IS
CURRENTLY PRODUCING SOME LARGER BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS IN THE
VALLEY...SO HIGH TEMPS TODAY MAY NEED TO BE RAISED SLIGHTLY. 

THE FORECAST CHALLENGE TODAY WILL BE WHETHER THE CLOUDS WILL CLEAR
ENOUGH TONIGHT TO ALLOW FOR A FREEZE OR FROST TO DEVELOP. THE NAM
SHOWS MORE CLOUDS TONIGHT THAN THE GFS. HOPEFULLY THE PICTURE WILL
BECOME CLEARER WITH THE 12Z MODEL RUNS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
AREA BY 15 UTC IN RESPONSE TO A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE OVER THE
OHIO VALLEY. MOISTURE IS LIMITED WITH THIS SYSTEM AND DYNAMICS IS
MAINLY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY...SO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR TODAY.
SATELLITE SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF MID-LEVEL CLOUDS WITH LOW-CLOUDS
MOVING ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF KENTUCKY. BROKEN LOW-CLOUDS WILL
MOVE EAST INTO THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE REGION TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...MAIN CONCERN IS POTENTIAL OF FREEZING TEMPERATURES
AND FROST. CLOUDS WILL BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY..EXCEPT MOSTLY CLEAR
SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT. MODELS DO HAVE A DISAGREEMENT ON HOW FAST AND
MUCH MID-LEVEL CLOUDS SPILL INTO THE REGION LATE TONIGHT. GFS TENDS
TO KEEP CLOUD COVER WEST...WHILE NAM SHOWS A MORE PROGRESSIVE EAST
MOVEMENT OF CLOUDS INTO THE AREA. WENT A MIDDLE GROUND. HAVE ISSUED
A FREEZE WARNING FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA..NORTHEAST TENNESSEE..FAR
EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. FROST
ADVISORY ELSEWHERE.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND 
REVEAL GENERALLY A QUIET PATTERN FOR THE FORECAST AREA INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. ON THURSDAY...A LONG-WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL LINGER 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION...WITH ANOTHER QUICK-MOVING 
CLIPPER SYSTEM AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA LATE THURSDAY INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT. WHILE PRECIP AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...850 MB TEMPS ARE PROGGED TO QUICKLY FALL BELOW 
FREEZING...SO WILL MENTION SOME SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN SETTLE OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH A HARD FREEZE EXPECTED OVER 
THE ENTIRE AREA ON SATURDAY MORNING. ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY...BEFORE A PATTERN CHANGE 
BEGINS TO DEVELOP EARLY NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL BEGIN 
TO AMPLIFY OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE NATION ON TUESDAY...WHICH 
WILL RESULT IN A WARMING TREND OVER THE FORECAST AREA AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT TUESDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND 
CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD... 
WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...LIGHT RAIN DWINDLED 
SIGNIFICANTLY THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU LEAVING 
BEHIND A SMATTERING OF SC AND AC. THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM TO AFFECT 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IS A HEALTHY SHORT WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY 
DROPPING SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE MIDWESTERN U.S. WAY TOO MUCH WEST TO 
NORTHWEST FLOW AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WITH NO CHANCE OF LOW LEVEL FLOW 
DEVELOPING OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO. THEREFORE...STAYED WITH SLIGHT 
AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE MOST PART AND LIMITED TO THE NORTHERN 
THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE SYSTEM IS A FAST MOVER AND MAY BE 
ENTIRELY ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS BY 18Z. MOS GUIDANCE BLEND LOOKS 
GOOD AND WAS USED FOR THE SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO 
CURRENT FORECAST. LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF 
THE NATION WITH CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. UNSEASONABLY COLD 
NORTHWEST FLOW INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL PULL SEVERAL FAST 
MOVING SHORT-WAVES ACROSS THE REGION...ESPECIALLY SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. PERIODS OF 
LIGHT SHOWERS WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE AREA/FAR 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS.  PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT...BUT 
VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A MENTION OF 
LIGHT SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN. NO ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

BESIDES THE PRECIPITATION...CHILLY AIRMASS WILL SETTLE INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH WIDESPREAD FROST/ 
LOCALIZED FREEZE ANTICIPATED WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT WITH 
WIDESPREAD FREEZE EXPECTED FRIDAY NIGHT. 

UPPER TROUGH WILL LOOSE ITS GRIP EARLY NEXT WEEK...AS UPPER TROUGH

.DISCUSSION...WEAK UPPER TROUGH SHIFTING SLOWLY EAST WITH A BAND OF
PATCHY LIGHT RAIN AND SOME DRIZZLE MOVING ONTO THE CUMBERLAND RISE.
BEST CHANCE OF MORE THAN JUST A COUPLE DROPS OF RAIN WILL BE ACROSS
THIS HIGHER TERRAIN REGION SO ADJUSTED POP TO LIKELY CATEGORY WITH
A SLIGHT UPWARD TWEAK ACROSS ADJACENT AREAS IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.
DIFFICULT FORECAST IN A WAY WHEN A WEAKENING SYSTEM IS MOVING IN
BECAUSE IT IS NOT ENTIRELY APPARENT HOW FAST OR HOW MUCH THE LIFT
WILL FADE. MODELS SUGGEST A SLOW WEAKENING TREND AND I SUPPOSE THE
LOW POPS MATCH THIS TO SOME DEGREE. AT ANY RATE...IT WILL BE A
LIGHT RAIN EVENT WHICH WILL BE TOUGH TO ACTUALLY MEASURE IN THE
BUCKETS. WAS CONCERNED ABOUT EDGING MAX TEMPS BACK WITH THE
APPROACHING MID DECK BUT NOTICED THE RATHER DECENT WARMING THIS
MORNING SO WILL STAY WITH CURRENT TEMPERATURE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG A LEXINGTON TO NASHVILLE TO TUPELO 
LINE...WITH A MILD AIR MASS (FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR) OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED SHOWERS OCCURRING AHEAD 
AND BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT...AS A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES 
OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS UPPER TROUGH IS PROGGED TO 
FURTHER AMPLIFY OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...AND WILL PUSH 
ANOTHER STRONGER COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION LATE TONIGHT. THIS 
SECOND COLD FRONT SHOULD ALSO PRODUCE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS WITH 
SCATTERED SHOWERS...MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN WEATHER STORY WILL BE 
LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
UNSEASONABLY COLD NORTHWEST FLOW INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL 
PULL SEVERAL FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVES ACROSS THE REGION...ESPECIALLY 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR WEDNESDAY AND AGAIN 
THURSDAY. PERIODS OF LIGHT SHOWERS WILL SPREAD ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
THIRD OF THE AREA/FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS BOTH DAYS/NIGHT. 
PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT...BUT VERTICAL TEMPERATURE 
PROFILE WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR A MENTION OF LIGHT SNOW ACROSS THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. NO ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

BESIDES THE PRECIPITATION...CHILLY AIRMASS WILL PULL INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH WIDESPREAD FROST/ 
LOCALIZED FREEZE ANTICIPATED WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY NIGHT WITH 
WIDESPREAD FREEZE EXPECTED FRIDAY NIGHT. 

UPPER TROUGH WILL LOOSE ITS GRIP NEXT WEEKEND/EARLY NEXT WEEK...AS 
UPPER TROUGH LIFTS NORTHEAST AND FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL FOR 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...THEN SOUTHWEST FOR MONDAY AS AN UPPER TROUGH 
MOVES INTO THE ROCKIES. WARMER CONDITIONS WILL RETURN NEXT WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...A VERY QUIET SHORT
TERM IN STORE. HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL THROUGH MONDAY
MORNING AND WILL START TO PUSH OFF TO THE EAST THROUGHOUT THE DAY
AS THE NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES.

TONIGHT WILL BE SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT WITH EXPECTED LOWS IN THE MID 
TO UPPER 30S NORTH...UPPER 30S TO NEAR 40 CENTRAL...AND NEAR 40 
SOUTH. PATCHY FOG AND FROST WILL ONCE AGAIN BE POSSIBLE AS MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS WILL BE IN PLACE. MOST OF MONDAY WILL 
REMAIN SUNNY BEFORE CLOUDS START TO INCREASE MONDAY EVENING AHEAD OF 
AN APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. LOW 
TEMPS ON MONDAY NIGHT WILL BE 5 TO 10 DEGREES WARMER DUE TO THE 
INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER THUS PREVENTING GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING
WITH MOST AREAS SEEING LOW TEMPS IN THE MID 40S.



.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE LONG TERM PERIOD WILL
FEEL MORE LIKE LATE NOVEMBER AS A LONG WAVE TROUGH SETS UP OVER THE
EASTERN U.S. THE TROUGH WILL BE IN NO HURRY TO DEPART WITH SEVERAL
SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES BUILDING SOUTHEAST OUT OF CANADA INTO
THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. AS THE SEASONS
CHANGE...THE FLOW ALOFT STRENGTHENS LEADING TO FAST MOVING SYSTEMS
TYPICAL OF THE COLDER PART OF THE YEAR. THE FIRST FEATURE BUILDS IN
ON TUESDAY WITH A SMALL CHANCE FOR SHOWERS MAINLY ACROSS THE
NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

ANOTHER STRONGER WAVE DROPS INTO THE REGION LATER TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY BRINGING A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS THROUGH THE 
DAY WEDNESDAY. MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT WITH STRENGTH AND 
TIMING OF YET ANOTHER SHORT WAVE BUILDING ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO 
VALLEY THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY WITH LIMITED AVAILABLE MOISTURE. 
THEREFORE...OPTED NOT TO ADD POPS AT THIS TIME FOR THIS ACTION. WE 
MAY SEE A SLIGHT REBOUND IN TEMPERATURES SATURDAY WITH SOME SUNSHINE 
RETURNING AS THE UPPER FLOW TRENDS TOWARD ZONAL WHILE AWAITING THE 
FINAL WEATHER SYSTEM OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. PREFERRED THE SLOWER 
ECMWF FOR THIS UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM WHICH 
WOULD IMPACT THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS MAINLY DURING THE DAY SUNDAY 
WITH ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS. CONCERNING THE TEMPERATURE 
FORECAST...EDGED MAX AND MINS TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW MEX MOS 
GOING A LITTLE CLOSER TO ECM NUMBERS. STILL APPEARS THAT THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA MAY BE SEEING LOW TEMPERATURES 
VERY NEAR OR BELOW FREEZING THURSDAY...FRIDAY AND SATURDAY MORNING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...WITH AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL BRING DRY AND TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS TO THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH NEAR NORMAL 
TEMPS EXPECTED. WILL PLAN TO LEAVE THE FROST ADVISORY IN EFFECT 
AROUND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WHERE TEMPS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE 30S 
WITH CALM WINDS AND CLEAR SKIES. HOWEVER...WILL CANCEL THE FROST 
ADVISORY FOR SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...WHERE TEMPS/DEWPOINTS 
ARE STILL IN THE 40S WITH A TIGHTER PRESSURE GRADIENT PRODUCING A 
PERSISTENT LIGHT WIND FLOW. CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS ARE EXPECTED 
TONIGHT...SO WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING ALONG THE WATERWAYS 
DUE TO THE EXPECTED LARGE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE AIR AND WATER 
TEMPS. WILL ALSO PLAN TO MENTION SOME PATCHY FROST TONIGHT OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...AND THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU... 
WHERE TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO FALL INTO THE 30S BEFORE SUNRISE. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...SURFACE WINDS WILL SHIFT TO 
THE SOUTH ON MONDAY...RESULTING IN A BRIEF WARM UP AS HIGHS WILL 
RETURN TO THE LOWER 70S IN MOST SPOTS. HOWEVER...THE OVERALL TREND 
FOR THE WEEK AHEAD WILL BE THE COOLER TEMPERATURES IN STORE FOR THE 
REGION AS A SERIES OF WEAK FRONTS PUSH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY INTO 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE FIRST FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH ON 
TUESDAY...PERHAPS BRINGING A STRAY SHOWER OR TWO...WITH AN A 
SECONDARY FRONT MOVING THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY. A PUSH OF COOLER AIR 
WILL KNOCK HIGHS IN THE MID 50S AND LOWER 60S AND LOWS IN THE 30S 
FOR THE MIDDLE TO LATER HALF OF THE WEEK. WITH FAIRLY CALM AND 
MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS IN PLACE BY TUESDAY NIGHT... NEARING 
FREEZING TEMPERATURES SEEM PROBABLE IN MANY LOCATIONS AND THINK THAT 
THE FIRST FREEZE OF THE SEASON WILL BE POSSIBLE /AT LEAST ACROSS 
PORTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE/ BY WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. AT THE VERY LEAST...WIDESPREAD FROST SEEMS LIKE A GOOD 
PROBABILITY THOSE DAYS AND AN ADVISORY FOR A FROST AND/OR A FREEZE 
MAY BE NEEDED LATER THIS WEEK. ADDITIONAL COOL NIGHTS WITH LOWS NEAR 
FREEZING TO THE MID TO UPPER 30S SEEM PROBABLE THROUGH THE END OF 
THE WORK WEEK...BEFORE A VERY SUBTLE WORK UP MAY BE ON THE WAY FOR 
THE UPCOMING WEEKEND.

252 PM EDT SAT OCT 19 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH
WILL SWING THROUGH THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON ALONG WITH ITS
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. CURRENT SURFACE OBS INDICATE THAT THE COLD
FRONT IS LOCATED ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND WILL MOVE INTO
THE CENTRAL VALLEY SHORTLY. MODELS SHOW THE FRONT EXITING OUR AREA
LATER THIS EVENING. A LIGHT SHOWER IS POSSIBLE WITH THE FRONTAL
PASSAGE BUT MOST PLACES WILL STAY DRY. BRIEF GUSTY WINDS OF AROUND
20 TO 25 KTS CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH
WINDS DROPPING BACK DOWN BETWEEN 5 AND 15 KTS BEHIND THE FRONT.

CLOUDS SHOULD CLEAR BEHIND THE FRONT TONIGHT ALLOWING LOWS TO DROP 
DOWN INTO THE UPPER 30S NORTH TO NEAR 40 SOUTH....WHICH WILL BE 5 TO 
10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. SOME SHELTERED VALLEY LOCATIONS COULD SEE 
PATCHY FROST TOWARD SUNRISE. ALSO...PATCHY AREAS OF FOG MAY DEVELOP 
TOWARD SUNRISE AS WELL. HOWEVER...IF WINDS STAY UP THROUGH THE 
NIGHT...FOG AND FROST WILL BE LESS LIKELY. WILL MENTION PATCHY AREAS 
OF 4SM FOG AND PATCHY FROST IN ZONES.

CONDITIONS GREATLY IMPROVE TOMORROW AS THE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT ARE 
WELL OFF TO OUR NORTHEAST. MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES ARE EXPECTED WITH HIGH 
TEMPS A FEW DEGREES COOLER DUE TO THE FRONTAL PASSAGE WITH MID TO UPPER 
60S SOUTH...MID 60S CENTRAL...AND UPPER 50S TO NEAR 60 NORTH. MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES SUNDAY NIGHT WITH LOWS ONCE AGAIN IN THE UPPER 30S NORTH 
TO NEAR 40 SOUTH.


.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MONDAY STARTS OUT DRY WITH A
FAIR AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE. HOWEVER...CLOUDS AND SOME LIGHT SHOWERS
WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER NORTHERN SECTIONS ON TUESDAY AS AN AMPLIFIED
UPPER TROUGH BUILDS INTO THE EASTERN U.S. AS MODELS HAVE BEEN
ADVERTISING...MORE ENERGY DROPS INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE LONG WAVE
TROUGH ON WEDNESDAY BRINGING ANOTHER CHANCE FOR A FEW SHOWERS
ACROSS THE NORTHERN TWO THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE TROUGH
WILL BE VERY SLOW TO LIFT OUT SO BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL BE
A MAIN FEATURE OF THE FORECAST THROUGH THE WORK WEEK WITH A SLIGHT
WARMING TREND POSSIBLE BY SATURDAY AS THE EASTERN TROUGH EDGES EAST
TO THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD. IT WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR FREEZING
TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA AS WELL
AS TERRAIN ABOVE 3000 FEET FARTHER SOUTH.

.DISCUSSION...CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE MOSTLY ON TRACK THIS 
MORNING. SURFACE OBS STILL SHOWING COLD FRONT BACK ACROSS WESTERN 
TN. SHOWERS ALONG THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST THROUGH THE 
DAY BUT MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY WILL LIFT JUST TO OUR NORTH AS THE 
BASE OF THE TROUGH LIFTS NORTH AS WELL. HOWEVER...MOST AREAS CAN 
STILL EXPECT TO SEE SOME PATCHY AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN AND DRIZZLE WITH 
BETTER CHANCES BEING ACROSS OUR NORTHERN MOST AREAS. CLOUD COVER 
SHOULD HANG IN THROUGH THE REST OF THE DAY HELPING TO KEEP TEMPS A 
FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL

THE ONLY CHANGES MADE TO THE FORECAST WERE TO KNOCK THE WINDS DOWN A 
BIT. MODELS SHOW THE CORE OF THE 850MB JET LIFTING JUST TO OUR 
NORTH. ALSO, SHOWERS LOOK TO BE ON THE LIGHTER SIDE THEREFORE MAKING 
IT HARDER FOR THEM TO PULL THESE FASTER WINDS ALOFT DOWN TO THE

MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING...AND ACROSS

UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND IT. THUS...WILL PLAN TO MENTION MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SKIES THROUGHOUT THE DAY...WITH CLEARING SKIES EXPECTED AFTER

DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...IN WAKE OF THE FRONT THAT WILL 
MOVE INTO THE REGION ON SATURDAY...A STOUT NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT 
WILL HELP TO REINFORCE SOME COOLER AIR INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS FOR SUNDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN HIGH TEMPERATURES IN 
THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S DESPITE THE ABUNDANT SUNSHINE. THE REAL 
NOTICEABLE CHANGE WILL BE AT NIGHT WHEN GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING 
WILL DROP LOWS INTO THE MID TO UPPER 30S IN MANY LOCATIONS. WILL 
CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A FREEZE SUNDAY NIGHT... 
THOUGH THINK TEMPERATURES SHOULD MOSTLY STILL IN THE 35-40 DEGREE 
RANGE WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND A FEW SHELTERED 
AREAS SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLD AIR DRAINAGE. HOWEVER...THINK THAT A FROST 
ADVISORY COULD BE NEEDED LATE SUNDAY NIGHT SO WILL MONITOR LATER

TUESDAY AND THEN AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY. THIS SECONDARY PUSH OF EVEN 
COOLER AIR WILL KNOCK HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S AND LOWER 60S AND LOWS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...NOT SEEING MUCH SIGNIFICANT 
WEATHER CONCERNS FOR THESE PERIODS...AS A STEADY INCREASE IN CLOUDS 
OVERNIGHT INHIBITS FOG DEVELOPMENT. SOME CHILLY MIN TEMPS FOR 
SATURDAY NIGHT POSSIBLY AS LOW AS MID TO UPPER 30S IN SHELTERED 
HIGHER VALLEYS. HOWEVER...LIGHT NW WINDS BEHIND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE 
CERTAINLY DON'T FAVOR MUCH FROST FOR SUNDAY MORNING. COORDINATED 
WITH NWS NEIGHBORS AND FOUND SIMILAR THINKING...SO WON'T MENTION 
FROST JUST YET. COLDER MINS BY SUNDAY NIGHT LOOK MORE FAVORABLE...
AND THIS IS ALREADY HIGHLIGHTED IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK.

HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER LEVEL JET ARE ALREADY STREAMING 
ACROSS THE REGION. MID LAYER CLOUDS WILL INCREASE LATER TONIGHT WITH 
THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING ACROSS THE MS 
VALLEY REGION. ADDED A DEGREE OR TWO TO THE GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT 
DUE TO ANTICIPATED CLOUDS.

PRAIRIES INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND MIDWESTERN U.S. DRY WEATHER WITH 
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND A TYPICAL TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL MID

COLD FRONT ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...WITH A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS SLOWLY MOVING INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA. WITH THE RECENT RAINFALL...LIGHT WINDS...AND 
CLEARING SKIES...WILL CONTINUE THE DENSE FOG ADVISORY THIS

THIS DENSE FOG CAN BECOME EAST OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WITH CLOUDS 
SLOW TO COMPLETELY DISSIPATE AND WINDS NOT COMPLETELY CALM. OUTSIDE 
OF THIS MORNING'S FOG...EXPECT TRANQUIL CONDITIONS TODAY AND TONIGHT 
AS HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES OVER THE REGION. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
AND WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A BROAD TROUGH MOVING 
THROUGH THE EASTERN CONUS WILL DRAG ANOTHER FRONT THROUGH THE AREA 
AND BRING WITH IT ANOTHER SHOT OF COOLER AUTUMN AIR INTO THE REGION 
ON SATURDAY. GIVEN THE LACK OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE...AM NOT EXPECTING 
MUCH /IF ANY/ IN THE WAY OF PRECIPITATION. STILL...SOME ISOLATED 
SPOTTY SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THE DAY ON SATURDAY...BEFORE 
THE FRONT CLEARS THE REGION LATER THAT EVENING. IN ITS WAKE...THE 
AFOREMENTIONED COOLER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION WHICH COULD 
RESULT IN SOME HIGHER ELEVATIONS LOCATIONS AND OTHER SHELTERED AREAS 
SUSCEPTIBLE TO COLD AIR DRAINAGE TO APPROACH THE FREEZING MARK AS 
LOWS WILL BOTTOM OUT IN THE 30S IN MANY LOCATIONS. WINDS WILL SHIFT 
TO THE SOUTH BY MONDAY...RESULTING IN A BRIEF WARM UP BEFORE ANOTHER 
WEAK FRONT AND SOME ADDITIONAL COOLER AIR MOVES IN TUESDAY/TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THIS WILL RESULT IN HIGHS IN THE UPPER 50S AND LOWER 60S AND 
LOWS IN THE 30S FOR THE MIDDLE TO LATER HALF OF THE WORK WEEK. WITH

CLOUDS ARE GRADUALLY CLEARING FROM THE WEST BEHIND AN EXITING COLD
FRONT. HOWEVER SURFACE DEWPOINTS UPSTREAM ARE STILL IN THE MID TO
UPPER 40S...AND WINDS ARE LIGHT...SO WE ARE NOT GOING TO SEE STRONG
DRY AIR ADVECTION OVERNIGHT. WITH THE MOIST GROUND FROM EARLIER
RAINFALL...AREAS OF DENSE FOG ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP. CONFIDENCE
OF FOG IS HIGHEST IN THE PLATEAU WHERE SKIES ARE ALREADY

309 PM EDT THU OCT 17 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...INTENSITY OF SHOWERS ALONG 
THE COLD FRONT HAS INCREASED OVER SE TN...BUT NO LIGHTNING STRIKES 
INDICATED YET. BEST COVERAGE OF LINGERING SHOWERS AND PERHAPS AN 
ISOLATED TSRA...WILL BE BEFORE 8PM EDT. OTHERWISE...TRENDED CLOSE
TO PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS IN TIMING THE END OF THE RAIN BEFORE
MIDNIGHT. IF MODELS ARE CORRECT IN PARTIAL CLEARING THEN THE
STAGE MAY BE SET FOR AREAS OF DENSE FOG TO FORM. I PUT IN SOME
PATCHY DENSE FOG WITH VISBY 1/4 MILE IN THE TYPICALLY FAVORED SPOTS
BY 09Z FRIDAY. DUE TO FOG FORMATION...I CHOSE TO GO AROUND A DEGREE
OR SO ABOVE THE GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT.

GENERALLY NO REAL CHANGES FOR FRIDAY OR FRIDAY NIGHT WITH DRY 
WEATHER AND NEAR SEASONAL TEMPS. I DID CARRY THE PATCHY DENSE FOG 
JUST INTO MID MORNING FRIDAY...AND BROUGHT IN MORE CLOUDINESS LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. EXPECTING A FEW SPOTS OF FOG AGAIN LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT UNCERTAINTY DUE TO THE POTENTIAL INCREASING 
CLOUDS. 

RAIN CHANCES ON SATURDAY ARE NOT TOO GREAT AT THIS POINT...AND ARE 
DUE TO SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE MID MS AND OHIO RIVER 
VALLEYS. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL REINFORCE OUR COOLER OR 
SEASONAL TEMPS...BUT FORCING IS NOT THAT SIGNIFICANT. GFS AND NAM 
MODEL SOLUTIONS SUGGEST LOW CHANCE OVER SW VA AND NE TN...WITH ONLY 
SREF SOLUTIONS SPREADING LIGHT QPF OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
KEPT THE CENTRAL AND SRN VALLEYS OF E TN DRY FOR NOW...WITH 20 TO 30 
PERCENTS POPS ELSEWHERE FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON. TRENDED CLOSE TO GFS 
MAX TEMPS EACH DAY.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE 12Z RUNS OF THE 
GFS/ECMWF CAME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THIS PERIOD OF THE 
FORECAST. A MOISTURE STARVED SHORT WAVE MOVES OUT SATURDAY NIGHT 
WITH THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW FLATTENING OUT IN ITS WAKE. A NICE LARGE 
SURFACE HIGH AND DRY AIR SHOULD KEEP ANY PRECIP AWAY THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT. HOWEVER...AN AMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH BUILDS INTO THE EASTERN 
STATES TUESDAY WITH ADDITIONAL ENERGY DROPPING INTO THE MEAN TROUGH 
ON WEDNESDAY. THIS SYSTEM APPEARS TO LACK DEEP MOISTURE AND 
THEREFORE KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR SHOWERS TUESDAY INTO 
TUESDAY NIGHT. SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST WEDNESDAY INTO 
THURSDAY CONSIDERING THE IMPACT OF THE TRAILING WAVE BUT THIS 
FEATURE LOOKS MOISTURE STARVED AS WELL SO DID NOT MENTION PRECIP FOR 
WEDNESDAY OR THURSDAY. FALL IS IN THE AIR AND GENERALLY KEPT MAX AND 
MIN TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW THE SEASONAL NORM FOR MID OCTOBER 
ESPECIALLY LATE IN THE PERIOD AS THE AMPLIFIED DEPARTING TROUGH 
PULLS SOME FRESH CANADIAN AIR INTO THE REGION.

326 PM EDT WED OCT 16 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...A COLD FRONT WILL
CONTINUE TO PUSH EAST TOWARDS THE AREA THROUGH THE NIGHT. LIGHT
ISOLATED SHOWERS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS FRONT IN THE
LATER AFTERNOON HOURS...WITH THE MAIN AREA OF PRECIP ARRIVING ON
THE PLATEAU IN THE EARLY EVENING. MODELS HAVE CONSISTENTLY SHOWED
THE FRONT SLOWING DOWN...SO PUSHED TIMING OF POPS BACK FROM
PREVIOUS FORECAST ISSUANCES. WITH WEAK INSTABILITIES AND A MOIST
ATMOSPHERIC PROFILE...RAIN LOOKS TO BE THE ONLY FORM OF CONVECTION
EXPECTED THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.

ANOTHER WAVE OF GEOSTROPHIC FORCING WILL MAKE ITS WAY UP THE COASTAL 
STATES TOWARDS OUR AREA...BRINGING A HIGHER CHANCE FOR PRECIP AND 
HIGH RAINFALL AMOUNTS FOR THURSDAY. INSTABILITIES AND WINDS FAIRLY 
WEAK ON THURSDAY...SO AGAIN ONLY EXPECT PRECIP. THE FRONT WILL EXIT 
THE REGION IN THE LATE HOURS THURSDAY. UPSLOPE FLOW IS EXPECTED WITH 
THE BEST CHANCES FOR ANY RAIN ON THURSDAY EVENING IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. 

OVERCAST SKIES WILL BE PRESENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. WITH 
THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE PRESENT IN THE LOW LEVELS AND WEAK 
WINDS...EXPECT FOG DEVELOPMENT IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS ON 
THURSDAY...ESPECIALLY IN AREAS THAT RECEIVED HEAVY RAINFALL. 
TEMPERATURES WILL COOL BEHIND THIS FRONT TO SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL. 


.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...THESE PERIODS WILL FIND AN
OVERALL SEMI-PERMANENT SETUP IN THE UPPER LEVELS...WITH A TROUGH IN
EASTERN CANADA AND THE GREAT LAKES...FLANKED BY RIDGES OVER THE
WESTERN ATLANTIC...AND OFF THE PACIFIC COAST. THIS SCENARIO PUTS
OUR AREA INTO A FAIRLY PROGRESSIVE WESTERLY OR NORTHWESTERLY FLOW
WITH A FEW DISTURBANCES THAT WILL PROPAGATE THROUGH THE REGION.

DISTURBANCE #1 LOOKS TO BE ON SATURDAY...BUT MOISTURE LOOKS MAINLY 
NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE AREA...SO KEEPING POPS LOW ON THE EDGES AND 
DRY IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY.  THERE MAY BE ANOTHER WEAK DISTURBANCE 
AROUND MONDAY...AND THEN THE AMPLIFIED TROUGH IS APPROACHING THE 
AREA TOWARD THE END OF THIS PERIOD WITH A STRONGER FRONT.

WE SHOULD ALSO HAVE SEVERAL WEAK SHOTS OF COOLER AIR THAT WILL GET 
US CLOSER TO SEASONAL AVERAGE TEMPERATURES FOR THESE DAYS.  THERE 
WILL BE LITTLE TIME TO RECOVER DEEP/RICH MOISTURE BETWEEN ALL THESE 
SYSTEMS...SO NOT ONLY SHOULD THERE BE NO SEVERE WEATHER...BUT WILL 
KEEP THE LIMITED PRECIP AS JUST SHOWERS AS WELL.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
THE AREA REMAINS SITUATED BETWEEN A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE
SOUTHWEST OF THE REGION AND AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM OVER THE
NORTHERN PLAINS WHICH WILL DRAG A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST
AREA TOMORROW. AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...MID TO HIGH-LEVEL DECKS OF
CLOUDS CONTINUE TO INFILTRATE THE REGION...THOUGH SOME BREAKS IN
THEM AND A SOUTHERLY FLOW HAVE ALLOWED TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB WELL
INTO THE 70S ONCE AGAIN. MODELS HAVE SLOWED THE TIMING OF THIS
SYSTEM AND ITS ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION...AS BOTH THE NAM AND GFS
DO NOT SHOW ANY QPF SIGNALS APPROACHING THE WESTERN PLATEAU
COUNTIES BEFORE 12Z. AS A RESULT...HAVE SCALED BACK POPS TONIGHT TO
LOW-END CHANCE ALONG THE WESTERN CWA BOUNDARY BETWEEN 06-12Z TO
ACCOUNT ADDITIONALLY...HAVE ONLY A NARROW BAND OF LIKELY POPS IN
THE FAR WEST BEFORE 18Z TOMORROW...BEFORE GRADUALLY INCREASING THEM
BY THE AFTERNOON AS FRONT MOVES IN. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT THE
HEAVIEST PRECIPITATION WILL BE 00Z THURSDAY AND BEYOND...AS
PRECIPITATION MAY BE ON THE LIGHTER SIDE INITIALLY WITH THE
WEAKENING BOUNDARY. ALSO...GIVEN THE SLOWER PROGRESS OF THE
FRONT...THINK TEMPERATURES MAY BE ABLE TO REACH THE LOWER 70S
ACROSS THE VALLEY...BEFORE THE BLAST OF COOLER AIR MOVES IN FOR
THURSDAY.


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WILL BEGIN WITH A FRONT STALLED NEAR THE 
AREA. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL LIFT NE FROM THE PLAINS TO THE 
GREAT LAKES...WHICH WILL ENHANCE LIFT ALONG THE STALLED FRONT LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. THE NAM IS MUCH MORE ENTHUSIASTIC WITH 
LIFT OVER THE AREA ON THURSDAY THAN THE GFS...WITH A LARGE SPREAD IN 
MOS POPS BETWEEN THE TWO. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE HIGHER NAM 
POPS...CATEGORICAL SOUTH TO LIKELY ELSEWHERE THURSDAY MORNING. THE 
SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH QUICKLY...WITH ALL POPS ENDING BY 06Z FRIDAY. 
WITH THE FRONT PUSHING TO OUR EAST...A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS 
BUILDS IN ON FRIDAY.

THE LATEST GFS MODEL RUNS HAVE TRENDED TOWARD A SHARPER TROUGH THAT 
WILL BRING PRECIP TO THE SOUTHEAST ON SATURDAY. IT HAS BEEN TRENDING 
TOWARD THE ECMWF...WHICH HAS BEEN CONSISTENTLY SHOWING A MORE 
AMPLIFIED TROUGH EACH RUN FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS. THE GEFS MEMBERS 
ARE IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT TODAY...SHOWING A SWATH OF PRECIP OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND NOTHERN GA ON SATURDAY. WHILE WETTER 
THAN PREVIOUS RUNS...THE OPERATIONAL GFS REMAINS A DRY OUTLIER 
COMPARED TO THE ENSEMBLE MEMBERS AND ENSEMBLE MEAN...AS IT 
SUPPRESSES PRECIP FARTHER SOUTH. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE ENSEMBLE 
SOLUTION. AS A RESULT...WILL INCREASE POPS SLIGHTLY IN SOUTHEASTERN 
PORTIONS OF THE AREA FOR SATURDAY. 

A BROAD UPPER TROUGH REMAINS OVER THE EASTERN CONUS FOR THE REST OF 
THE FORECAST. GULF MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE SUPPRESSED WELL SOUTH OF 
THE AREA. WILL HAVE A DRY FORCAST SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WITH 
TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL.

SOUTHWEST AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING STORM SYSTEM OVER THE
NORTHERN/CENTRAL PLAINS THAT WILL PUSH A FRONT TOWARD THE REGION
TOMORROW. THE SUBTROPICAL RIDGE HAS SHIFTED BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST
AND STRONG SOUTHWEST/WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT HAS ALLOWED FOR SOME DECKS
OF MID/HIGH CLOUDS TO MOVE IN ACROSS THE REGION AHEAD OF THIS STORM
SYSTEM. DESPITE THIS CLOUD COVER...SOME BREAKS IN IT ALONG WITH THE

CAROLINAS AND MID ATLANTIC STATES...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY MILD AIR 
MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDINESS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...BUT MOST OF 
THIS APPEARS TO BE THIN HIGH CLOUDS WITH SOME BREAKS EXPECTED FROM 
TIME TO TIME. THUS...EXPECT PATCHY DENSE FOG TO DEVELOP LATER 
TOWARDS SUNRISE...ESPECIALLY AROUND THE WATERWAYS.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO MENTION PATCHY DENSE FOG WITH 
VISIBILITIES LESS THAN A FOURTH OF A MILE IN SOME AREAS...AND WILL 
TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS WILL SLOWLY BEGIN TO FLATTEN OVERNIGHT AS AN
UPPER-LOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS SHIFTS EAST AND DRAGS A FRONT
SLOWLY TOWARD THE AREA. DESPITE THE CLOUD COVER IS THAT EXPECTED
TO CONTINUE TO FILTER ACROSS THE AREA OVERNIGHT AND AGAIN TOMORROW
AHEAD OF THE AFOREMENTIONED STORM SYSTEM...ONE MORE NIGHT AND DAY
OF FAIRLY MILD AND DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED. GIVEN THE MOIST
BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS... AND CALM WINDS...PATCHY FOG SEEMS
PROBABLE ONCE AGAIN ACROSS THE REGION /ESPECIALLY IN SHELTERED
VALLEYS AND NEAR RIVERS AND LAKES/ AFTER MID NIGHT THROUGH MID-
MORNING. WINDS WILL QUICKLY VEER TO THE SOUTHWEST AFTER SUNRISE AND
INCREASE...ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO ONCE AGAIN REACH THE MID TO
UPPER 70S IN MOST SPOTS BY THE AFTERNOON...UNDER A PARTLY SUNNY
SKY.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BR TRACKING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO 
GREAT LAKES TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...AND PRECIP ASSOCIATED 
WITH THE TRAILING COLD FRONT WILL PUSH INTO OUR AREA LATE TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THE MID-UPPER FLOW REMAINS FAIRLY ZONAL OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST...AND WITH THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER SO FAR NORTH...LIFT 
NEAR THE FRONT WEAKENS AS IT MOVES EAST. SO HIGHEST POPS ON 
WEDNESDAY WILL BE IN WESTERN AREAS...LIKELY POPS WEST TO CHANCE POPS 
EAST. WITH THE FRONT BECOMING ORIENTED PARALLEL TO THE SW UPPER 
FLOW...THE FRONT STALLS NEAR THE APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. NAM 
AND GFS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SCENARIO.

A SECOND SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS SHOWN BY THE NAM...GFS...AND ECMWF TO 
CROSS THE OHIO VALLEY ON THURSDAY. THIS WILL BRING POPS BACK UP INTO 
THE CHANCE RANGE FOR THURSDAY...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS SOUTHEAST 
CLOSER TO THE STALLED FRONT. THERE ARE SOME MODEL DIFFERENCES IN THE 
AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE...SO WILL NOT RAISE POPS INTO THE 
LIKELY RANGE JUST YET. THE TROUGH MOVES THROUGH QUICKLY...AND DRIER 
AIR BUILDS IN THURSDAY NIGHT. 

FOR THE WEEKEND...THE GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER CONSIDERABLY..SO 
CONFIDENCE IS LOW. THE GFS MAINTAINS A BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER THE 
EASTERN CONUS WITH VERY LITTLE NORTHWARD MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM THE 
GULF. THE ECMWF HAS A MUCH SHARPER TROUGH...DEEP MOISTURE ADVECTION 
AHEAD OF A FRONT FOR SATURDAY...AND A PRONOUNCED COLD FROPA SATURDAY 
NIGHT. THERE IS ALSO A WIDE SPREAD AMONG THE GEFS MEMBERS...WITH 
ONLY ONE MEMBER RESEMBLING THE ECMWF. THE GFS IS PREFERED AT THIS 
TIME...BUT WILL MAINTAIN THE CURRENT FORECAST OF A SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
FOR SAT/SAT NIGHT TO ACCOUNT FOR THE ECMWF.

BUILD IN BEHIND THE WEEKEND/S WEAK COLD FRONT FOR GENERALLY DRY 
CONDITIONS MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  THE MAIN SYSTEM OF CONCERN DURING 
THE EXTENDED CONTINUES TO BE A COLD FRONT THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE 
REGION AROUND THE WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY TIME FRAME.  THERE CONTINUES TO 
BE TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN MODELS AND RUNS SO CONFIDENCE REMAINS 
TOO LOW TO INCREASE POPS TO LIKELY FOR ANY PARTICULAR DAY.  
HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE IS HIGH THAT THERE WILL BE A BAND OF SHOWERS 
MOVING THROUGH IN ADVANCE OF THE SYSTEM.  HAVE TRIED TO GO WITH A 
BLENDED SOLUTION FOR NOW AND HAVE TRENDED HIGHEST POPS TOWARDS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THOUGH CHANCE POPS WILL REMAIN SPREAD OVER THE 
AREA FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.  MODELS DIVERGE FURTHER FOR 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AND CONFIDENCE QUIET LOW FOR THIS PERIOD.  
THEREFORE...WILL MAKE LITTLE CHANGE TO THE FORECAST AND HAVE 
CONTINUED WITH DRY CONDITIONS FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...
THE CONVECTION OVER WEST TN WILL DISSIPATE BY LATE TONIGHT AS IT
MOVES FARTHER EAST. CLOUD COVER ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LOW OFF
THE NC COAST WILL CONTINUE TO PLAGUE SOUTHWEST VA AND NE TN. THERE
COULD BE SOME LIGHT RAIN THE DEVELOPS AFTER MIDNIGHT AND AFFECTS
THESE AREAS...OTHERWISE THERE WILL BE SOME AREAS OF PATCHY FOG
THROUGH 9 AM OR SO. 

BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON NE TN AND SW VA COULD SEE ADDITIONAL CHANCES
FOR LIGHT RAIN AS SHORTWAVE TRANSLATES ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL
KY. CONFIDENCE IS RATHER LOW WITH THIS SCENARIO BUT NEARLY ALL THE
MODELS CRANK OUT MEASURABLE PRECIP GENERALLY NORTH OF I-40. 

.LONG TERM...SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY... 
IN WAKE OF A WEAK FRONT CLEARING THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT...A
RETURN OF MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL RESULT IN PATCHY FOG
DEVELOPMENT BY EARLY MONDAY MORNING AND ANOTHER WARM START TO THE
WORK WEEK WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 70S MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE MAIN
FORECAST CONCERN CONTINUES TO BE THE STORM SYSTEM PROGGED TO IMPACT
THE REGION DURING THE MIDDLE TO LATER PART OF THE WORK WEEK. THE
LATEST RUN OF THE GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW THE FRONT AND ASSOCIATED
PRECIPITATION MOVING INTO THE REGION LATE WEDNESDAY AND
OVERSPREADING THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. THE ECMWF
IS SLIGHTLY SLOWER IN THE TIMING... BUT STILL SHOWS A
THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME OF THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. AS
SUCH...HAVE MAINTAINED THE HIGHEST POPS ON WEDNESDAY
NIGHT/THURSDAY...BUT HAVE HELD OFF ON GOING LIKELY JUST YET GIVEN
THE TIMING UNCERTAINTIES. STILL HAVE CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT
GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR A LATER FRONTAL PASSAGE...BUT SHOW GOOD
CLEARING FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT GIVEN THE DRIER AIR PROGGED TO
MOVE IN. NEXT SATURDAY IS STILL A BIT UNCERTAIN GIVEN THE HIGH
MODEL SPREAD ON THE LOCATION OF ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM...SO FOR NOW
HAVE OPTED TO KEEP POPS SILENT. IN WAKE OF THE FRONT PASSAGE BY THE
END OF THE WEEK...COOLER AUTUMN AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE REGION...
RESULTING IN HIGHS RUNNING 10 TO 15 DEGREES COOLER.

STRATO CU DECKS WILL MAINLY AFFECT NE AREAS. ABOVE NORMAL

APPROACHING FROM THE WEST WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  
THE COMBINATION OF THESE TWO FEATURES SHOULD PRODUCE ISOLATED 
SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE AREA.  A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE BRIEFLY BUILDS IN BEHIND THE FRONT MONDAY AND TUESDAY FOR A

AGAIN. THE CHALLENGE IS WHERE THE DENSER FOG IS MORE LIKELY TO OCCUR.
THINKING FOR NOW IS THAT TRI AND TYS WILL BE FAVORED SPOTS...BUT 
SOME DRIER AIR MOVING IN SHOULD LIMIT THE FOG TO WITHIN MVFR RANGE. 

WILL KEEP CHA VFR FOR THIS TAF ISSUANCE WITH VFR RETURNING TO BOTH 
TYS AND TRI BY MID MORNING FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...NOT MUCH CHANGE FOR THE SHORT 
TERM AS UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL BE TO OUR WEST...WITH AN UPPER LOW 
MOVING SLOWLY NEAR THE VA COAST.  SOME CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO BRUSH 
NORTHEAST ZONES INTO TONIGHT...BUT SHOULD BE LESS CLOUDS ON FRIDAY. 
OTHERWISE...MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL BE THE RULE. WILL GENERALLY 
USE A BLEND OF MAV/MET TEMPS FOR TONIGHT...AND WILL STAY CLOSE TO 
MAV NUMBERS FOR MAX TEMPS FRIDAY. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... AN UPPER-LEVEL
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE THE PREDOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE
CONTROLLING THE WEATHER ACROSS THE REGION THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY
NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL RESULT IN MAINLY WARM AND DRY CONDITIONS FOR
THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...WITH HIGHS PEAKING IN THE UPPER 70S TO
LOWER 80S EACH DAY. AN UPPER-LOW OFF OF THE VA/NC COAST COULD
RESULT IN SOME CLOUD COVER WORKING ITS BACK BACK INTO THE
REGION...BUT FOR THE MOST PART MOSTLY TO PARTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS
ARE EXPECTED DURING THE DAY...WITH SOME PATCHY FOG POSSIBLE NEAR
AREA LAKES/RIVERS AT NIGHT. THE OTHER FEATURE OF NOTE IS A DRY COLD
FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE AREA ON SUNDAY...BUT GIVEN THE
LACK OF MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT...AM NOT EXPECTED ANY SHOWER
DEVELOPMENT WITH IT. LATE IN THE PERIOD...MODELS DIFFER ON A STORM
SYSTEM PROGGED TO IMPACT THE REGION DURING THE MIDDLE TO LATER HALF
OF NEXT WEEK. THE GFS IS MUCH MORE PROGRESSIVE...SHOWING A FRONT
MOVING IN LATE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AND EXITING THE AREA BY
THURSDAY. THE ECMWF IS MUCH SLOWER AND DOES NOT BRING THE FRONT IN
UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. GIVEN THIS...HAVE BEEN CAUTIOUS ON
ADJUSTING POPS TO MUCH...BUT HAVE STILL GONE WITH SOLID CHANCE POPS
FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY FOR SHOWER DEVELOPMENT ALONG THIS
FRONT. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE LATEST MODEL TRENDS IN LATER
FORECASTS AND ADJUST AS NECESSARY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...NOT MUCH CHANGE IS 
EXPECTED OVER THESE FOUR PERIODS...WITH THE UPPER LOW WOBBLING IN 
PLACE OVER THE MID ATLANTIC. MODELS SHOW NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF 
OUR AREA POSSIBLY GETTING BRUSHED BY SOME WEAK LIFT.  BUT AIR MASS 
LOOKS PRETTY DRY OVERALL.  THINKING THAT CONGESTED CUMULUS CLOUDS 
WILL BE ABOUT ALL THAT WILL DEVELOP OVER THIS AREA...SW VA/NE TN.  
FARTHER SOUTHWEST...THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN RESPONSE TO THE 
APPROACHING TROUGH FARTHER WEST.  THIS PUTS US IN A CONFLUENT NWLY 
FLOW ALOFT THAT ALSO FAVORS SUBSIDENCE AND DRY WEATHER. SO WILL KEEP 
THINGS DRY THROUGH THESE PERIODS.  STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS OVER AL/MS 
LOOK LIKE THEY WILL STAY MOSTLY WEST OF US.

FOR TEMPERATURES...WENT PRETTY CLOSE TO GFS MOS GUIDANCE OVERALL.  
BIGGEST EXCEPTION...WENT ABOUT 2-3 DEGREES WARMER ON THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN PLATEAU FRIDAY NIGHT AS WINDS STAY UP A BIT AND HAMPER 
RADIATIONAL COOLING.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
GFS AND ECMWF AGREE THAT HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE 
FOR THE WEEKEND AND BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. DRY WEATHER AND ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES CAN BE EXPECTED BENEATH THE RIDGE FOR SATURDAY 
THROUGH TUESDAY. THE NAM AND GFS PUSH A COLD FRONT INTO WEST TN/KY 
ON SUNDAY...BUT THERE IS VERY LITTLE MOISTURE AVAILABLE...AND IT 
STALLS/DISSIPATES BEFORE REACHING OUR AREA.

THE MODELS ARE COMING INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THEIR DEPICTIONS OF 
A CLOSED LOW TRACKING EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO UPPER MS 
VALLEY FOR TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY. MOISTURE ADVECTION IN THE 
SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING INCREASING CLOUDS ON 
TUESDAY...WITH CHANCE POPS IN WESTERN AREAS TUESDAY NIGHT. THE GFS 
TRANSITIONS THE CLOSED LOW INTO AN OPEN WAVE AT 500 MB...AND SO IS A 
BIT FASTER THAN THE ECMWF. IN EITHER CASE...HIGH CHANCE POPS ARE 
WARRANTED FOR WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL BE TO 
OUR WEST...WITH AN UPPER LOW MOVING UP NEAR THE NC COASTLINE.  THIS 
LOW MAY BRING SOME CLOUDS LATER TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY TO MAINLY FAR 
NORTHEAST ZONES. ELSEWHERE EXPECT MAINLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WITH TEMPS 
NOT FAR FROM NORMAL TONIGHT AND BIT ABOVE NORMAL THURSDAY.   

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...CLOSED WEAK LOW
JUST OFF NC COAST TO REMAIN IN ABOUT THE SAME PLACE THURSDAY NIGHT
THROUGH FRIDAY AND THEN BEGIN TO WEAKEN FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.
NAM MODEL A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH MOVING THE MOISTURE INTO NE
TN THURSDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. PREFER THE GFS WHICH KEEPS RAIN
EAST OF THE CWA BUT SOME CLOUDS WILL BE IN NE SECTIONS AT TIMES
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. A FEW SPRINKLES POSSIBLE IN
NE TN FRIDAY OTHERWISE DRY CONDITIONS AS RIDGING ALOFT DOMINATES
THE EASTERN TN VALLEY. THE CLOUDS MAY KEEP THE NE SECTIONS SLIGHTLY
WARMER AT NIGHT AND A DEGREE TWO COOLER DURING THE DAY THROUGH THE
WEEKEND. ELSEWHERE IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS TEMPERATURES WILL BE
SIMILAR TO TODAYS MID TO UPPER 70S WITH LOWER 80S POSSIBLE EXTREME
SOUTH AND LOWS IN THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S...NEAR NORMAL FOR THIS
TIME OF YEAR.

SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY A DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN STATES 
ALLOWS A COLD FRONT TO MOVE EASTWARD INTO THE MS VALLEY. THIS FRONT 
WEAKENS AND SLOWS SUNDAY AS IT APPROACHES THE EASTERN TN VALLEY AND  
BUMPS INTO THE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES. THE SURFACE LOW WITH 
THIS SYSTEM MOVES FAR TO THE NORTH INTO CANADA. ANOTHER SURFACE LOW 
ALONG THE SAME FRONT BECOMES MORE DOMINANT AS IT MOVES OUT OF THE 
ROCKIES MONDAY AND HEADS FOR THE MID MS VALLEY TUESDAY. THIS SHOULD 
FINALLY BREAK DOWN THE RIDGE WITH SHOWERS DEVELOPING IN ADVANCE OF 
THE FRONT. THE GFS AND ECMWF STILL DIFFER SLIGHTLY IN THEIR 
DEPICTIONS AND TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM. GFS BRINGS A WELL-DEFINED 
FRONT THROUGH THE CWA WEDNESDAY WITH ENOUGH DYNAMICS FOR SOME 
THUNDERSTORMS. THE ECMWF HAS MORE OF A SPLIT SYSTEM INITIALLY SUNDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AND THEN BRINGS THEM TOGETHER TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY. WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS TUESDAY INCREASING TO 
CHANCE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE ALONG AND 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT WEDNESDAY.

SURFACE TO 700 MB HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL DRIFT NE
TO NEW ENGLAND THROUGH THE PERIOD...WHILE LOW PRESSURE WILL BE
NEARLY STATIONARY OFF THE GA/SC COAST. AN EASTERLY FETCH OFF THE
ATLANTIC IS BRINGING SOME CLOUDS INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA
THIS MORNING...AND WILL KEEP PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS THERE TODAY.
THE REST OF THE AREA WILL SEE SUNNY SKIES WITH A DOWNSLOPE FLOW.
TEMPS TODAY WILL BE A BIT HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY WITH WEAK WARM
ADVECTION AT 850 MB. MODELS SHOW A THIN BAND OF 850 MB MOISTURE
OVER THE AREA TONIGHT THAT MAY KEEP SOME CLOUD COVER OVERHEAD...SO
WILL LEAN ON THE WARM SIDE OF MOS FOR LOW TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
MOSTLY FAIR WEATHER THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH UPPER RIDGING IN 
CONTROL. A WEAK UPPER LOW WOBBLING OVER THE CAROLINAS EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD WILL PROMPT SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALONG THE APPALACHIANS AND 
NEARBY PORTIONS OF SW VA WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. OTHERWISE NOT UNTIL 
DAY 7 WILL WE SEE POPS (20 PCTS) COVERING A LARGE CHUNK OF THE AREA...
AS OUR CONTROLLING RIDGE WEAKENS AND ALLOWS PRECIP TO MOVE IN FROM

IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH THE REGION LAST
NIGHT...A MUCH COOLER AND DRIER AUTUMN-LIKE AIR MASS HAS SETTLED
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. TEMPERATURES THIS EVENING HAVE
ALREADY DROPPED INTO THE 50S IN MOST LOCATIONS AS GOOD RADIATIONAL
COOLING HAS OCCURRED AFTER SUNSET. GIVEN THAT DEWPOINTS ARE STILL IN
THE MID 40S TO AROUND 50 DEGREES...THINK THAT LOWS IN THIS RANGE
SEEM LIKELY FOR LATER TONIGHT IN MANY PLACES...THOUGH SOME SPOTS IN
THE NORTHEAST ZONES COULD SLIP INTO THE LOWER 40S BY DAYBREAK.
THOUGH DRIER AIR IS IN PLACE...GIVEN THE STILL WARM WATER...PATCHY
FOG IN SHELTERED VALLEYS/NEAR LAKES AND RIVERS SEEMS LIKELY GIVEN
THE CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS...SO HAVE ADDED THIS TO THE FORECAST.

SOME AREAS OF RAIN SHOWERS AND PERHAPS A FEW ISOLATED RUMBLES OF
THUNDER. AN ADDITIONAL PLUME OF GULF MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH

.DISCUSSION...
WITH A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STILL CONTROLLING THE WEATHER ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS ARE
PREVAILING ACROSS THE REGION THIS EVENING. THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING AS TEMPERATURES QUICKLY DROP FROM THE LOW TO
MID 80S INTO THE LOWER 70S JUST AFTER SUNSET. WITH SUFFICIENT
BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE IN PLACE AND DEWPOINTS IN THE LOW TO MID
60S...LOWS WILL BE MILD ONCE AGAIN AND BOTTOM OUT IN THE LOWER 60S
IN MOST SPOTS...THOUGH SOME HIGHER LOCATIONS ACROSS SW VIRGINIA MAY
DIP INTO THE UPPER 50S. THESE CONDITIONS WILL ALSO SUPPORT THE
POTENTIAL FOR SOME FOG DEVELOPMENT AFTER MIDNIGHT...PARTICULARLY IN
SHELTERED VALLEYS AND NEAR BODIES OF WATER. THUS...HAVE A MENTION
OF THIS IN THE HWO. SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO
RUMBLE TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AREA...WHICH WILL HELP TO INCREASE
CLOUD COVER /ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN ZONES LATER
TONIGHT/. HOWEVER...FEEL THAT THIS ACTIVITY WILL REMAIN OUT OF THE
FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT AND HAVE MAINTAINED A DRY FORECAST.

225 PM EDT SAT OCT 5 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AIR MASS LINGERING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WITH THE LOCAL AIR MASS REMAINING MOSTLY 
UNCHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY...EXPECT PATCHY DENSE FOG TO FORM AGAIN 
LATE TONIGHT ALONG THE WATERWAYS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
A STRONG COLD FRONT (CURRENTLY OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND 
OZARKS REGION) WILL SLOWLY MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
ON SUNDAY...AS MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF TROPICAL STORM KAREN 
MOVES NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD OF IT. IT APPEARS THAT SUNDAY NIGHT WILL 
BE THE PERIOD WHEN WIDESPREAD SHOWERS SPREAD ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. THE BULK OF THE MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH KAREN SHOULD STAY 
EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS...WITH AROUND AN INCH OF RAIN EXPECTED OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. THIS RAIN WILL THEN EXIT THE FORECAST AREA ON 
MONDAY AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH...WITH MUCH COLDER AND DRIER 
AIR MOVING IN BY MONDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE ACTUALLY IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT THIS FORECAST CYCLE... 
AND WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE 
OVER THE REGION FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD. DRY WEATHER AND CLEAR 
SKIES WILL BE PRESENT EACH DAY...WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND 
THROUGH THE WORK WEEK. NEXT CHANCE FOR ANY PRECIP LOOKS TO BE LATE 
IN THE WEEKEND...AS AN UPPER LEVEL LOW AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
APPROACH THE AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE OVER THE AREA TODAY...THEN WILL SLOWLY 
DIRFT EASTWARD TONIGHT. AFTER SOME PATCHY MORNING FOG...WE WILL SEE 
ANOTHER DAY WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES. 
GFS MOS TEMPS HAVE BEEN TOO WARM LATELY...SO WILL UNDERCUT THEM BY A 
FEW DEGREES. A STABLE SOUNDING AND LACK OF LIFT WILL KEEP THE AREA 
DRY TODAY. A SOUTHERLY FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO 300 MB WILL DEVELOP 
TONIGHT WITH THE AXIS OF THE RIDGE TO THE EAST. HIGH CLOUDS WILL 
INCREASING FROM THE WEST LATE TONIGHT AS LOW PRESSURE TRACKS EAST 
ACROSS THE PLAINS. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
MAIN EVENT DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD WILL BE DEEP UPPER TROUGH
MOVING ACROSS THE MID-SECTION OF THE NATION INTO THE OHIO
VALLEY/GREAT LAKES SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. STRONG UPPER JET WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY PLACING THE TENNESSEE VALLEY UNDER THE
FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION. THE STRONG AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL
CIRCULATION AROUND THE JET WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTAL-GENETIC FORCING
ALONG A FRONTAL ZONE WHICH WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA LATE SUNDAY AND
EXIT MONDAY. A WIDESPREAD BAND OF SHOWERS WILL ACCOMPANY THE
FRONTAL BAND. INSTABILITY IS LIMITED...BUT WILL INCLUDE THUNDER FOR
THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY
MORNING.

TROPICAL SYSTEM KAREN WILL REMAIN WELL SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OF THE 
AREA AND WILL HAVE LIMITED EFFECT ON THE WEATHER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS.

FOR MONDAY NIGHT...DRIER AIR WILL PULL INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS WITH SKY CLEARING WITH MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES PULLING 
INTO THE REGION FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. UPPER TROUGH WILL LIFT 
NORTH OF THE AREA WITH UPPER RIDGING DEVELOPING BACK ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. 
UPPER RIDGING WILL ALLOW AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES TO WARM BACK INTO 
THE MIDDLE AND UPPER 70S (SOME LOWER 80S POSSIBLE).

THE FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK THIS EVENING AS HIGH PRESSURE
REMAINS IN PLACE AT THE SURFACE...PROMOTING MOSTLY CLEAR AND CALM
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE REGION ONCE AGAIN. THIS HAS LEAD TO SOME
GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING NOW THAT THE SUN HAS SET AS TEMPERATURES

CLEAR/CALM CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW FOR WIDESPREAD PATCHY FOG
DEVELOPMENT ONCE AGAIN...WITH SOME SHELTERED VALLEY LOCATIONS AND

UNCHANGED SINCE YESTERDAY...EXPECT PATCHY DENSE FOG TO FORM AGAIN 
LATE TONIGHT ALONG THE WATERWAYS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
THE REMNANTS OF TROPICAL STORM KAREN WILL MOVE NORTHEASTWARD THIS 
WEEKEND...WITH ITS MOISTURE BEGINNING TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SUNDAY AS A COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. MODELS THEN 
BEGIN TO DIVERGE SOME SUNDAY NIGHT WITH THE TIMING OF THIS COLD 
FRONT...WITH THE NAM AND ECMWF MODELS FASTER THAN THE GFS MODEL. 
WITH A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW PROGGED BY ALL THREE MODELS TO DEVELOP 
OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT...THINK THAT THE SLOWER GFS MODEL SOLUTION IS MORE REALISTIC. 
MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF KAREN SHOULD INCREASE OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH THIS DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE 
PRODUCING MOSTLY SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH A FEW TSTORMS. 
AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS CONTINUE TO REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH THE GFS NUMBERS CONTINUING

VERIFIED VERY WELL EITHER). THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO TREND TOWARDS

THE WARMER GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ON SUNDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A DEEP TROUGH AND UPPER LEVEL 
LOW WILL CONTINUE TO BRING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA 
THROUGH THE DAY ON MONDAY. INSTABILITY IS VERY LOW...WITH A STRONG 
CAPPING INVERSION IN THE LOW LEVELS. THE ATMOSPHERE IS VERY MOIST IN 
THE EARLY MORNING...THEN QUICKLY DRIES OUT AS THE FRONT PASSES 
THROUGH. THIS FRONT IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. WIND SHEAR IS STRONG WITH VERY STRONG MID AND 
UPPER LEVEL WINDS. AT THIS TIME...LOOKS LIKE MAIN CONVECTION WILL BE 
SHOWERS...WITH A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE. SEVERE WEATHER 
IS NOT EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER...WITH THE WIND PROFILE AND 
THE DRY MID-LEVEL AIR...THERE DOES SEEM TO BE A POSSIBILITY THAT A 
FEW OF THE STORMS COULD PRODUCE STRONG GUSTY WINDS. THE COLD FRONT 
IS THEN EXPECTED TO EXIT THE AREA OVERNIGHT MONDAY...WITH THE LOW 
PRESSURE CENTER MOVING TOWARDS THE NORTHEAST.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE IN FOR THE REST OF THE WORK WEEK. LOWERED 
TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES FROM PREVIOUS UPDATES. FLOW SHIFTS FROM 
THE SOUTH TO THE NORTH...BRINGING SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS IN THE 
FORECAST. CLEARING SKIES AND DRY WEATHER WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
FROM THE SURFACE TO 300 MB...A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TODAY AND TONIGHT. CHANCES OF AFTERNOON 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LOOKS TOO LOW TO WARRANT ANY POPS...AS 
LIFT IS LACKING UNDER THE RIDGE AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS FROM BOTH THE 
NAM AND GFS MAINTAIN AN AREA OF CIN. HIGH TEMPS TODAY WILL CONTINUE 
THE WARMING TREND...REACHING THE LOWER TO MID 80S IN THE VALLEY. 
LOWS TONIGHT WILL FOLLOW PERSISTENCE...IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...MAIN CONCERNS ARE UPPER TROUGH MOVING
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS SUNDAY AND REMAINS OF
TROPICAL SYSTEM KAREN PULLING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE CAROLINAS.
SATURDAY WILL START OUT DRY WITH CHA SOUNDING SHOWING A MID-LEVEL
CAPPING INVERSION. BY SUNDAY...MOISTURE INCREASES WITH AIRMASS
BECOMING MARGINALY UNSTABLE WITH CAPES OF 500 J/KG. PWS WILL
INCREASE TO 1.7 TO 1.8 INCHES WITH MOST OF TROPICAL MOISTURE FROM
KAREN REMAINING SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA. A STRONG JET MOVING
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY/GREAT LAKES WILL PLACE THE REGION UNDER THE
FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION. THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET
WILL ENHANCE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY
EVENING...WHICH WILL PRODUCE THE BEST CHANCES OF SHOWERS. WILL
INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER...BUT MAINLY SHOWERS.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER GREATLY IN 
REGARD TO CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
ECMWF KEEPS AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH MOISTURE 
FROM REMAINS OF KAREN REMAINING OVER THE AREA...WHILE THE GFS PULLS 
MOISTURE EAST. WILL FOLLOW GFS FOR NOW WITH DRIER CONDITIONS FOR 
MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
SOUTHEAST...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS AFTERNOON...OCCURRING IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY (WHICH WAS SLOWLY DRIFTING NORTHEASTWARD). CLOUDS ARE 
EXPECTED TO DECREASE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT BEHIND THIS 
SHORT WAVE...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW FOR A BETTER COVERAGE OF FOG ON 
FRIDAY MORNING. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION PATCHY FOG SINCE IT SHOULD 
MAINLY OCCUR NEAR THE RELATIVELY WARM WATERWAYS. THE NAM MODEL 
CONTINUES TO BE MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE GFS MODEL IN CREATING 
SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...MAINLY DUE TO ITS MORE 
UNSTABLE VERTICAL PROFILE. SINCE THE NAM MODEL SEEMS TO HAVE A 
BETTER HANDLE ON THE CURRENT SITUATION...WILL ADD A MENTION OF 
ISOLATED SHOWERS OVER SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC FOR FRIDAY. 
OTHERWISE...A DEEP SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL KEEP MOSTLY DRY AND 
UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...SO WILL GENERALLY TREND 
TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST SINCE THE AIR MASS IS NOT EXPECTED TO 
CHANGE MUCH DURING THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
THE NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE NORTHEAST 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO PUSH TROPICAL STORM KAREN 
TOWARDS THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. 
A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW WILL BRING SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA BEGINNING SUNDAY MORNING. CAPE IS LESS 
THAN 500 J/KG WITH PW VALUES AROUND 1.8 INCHES. THERE IS A GOOD 
AMOUNT OF SHEAR THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE...BUT DO NOT EXPECT MUCH 
SEVERE ACTIVITY WITH THIS SYSTEM. WITH THE INCREASED MOISTURE FROM 
THE GULF...ATMOSPHERE HAS A DEEP MOIST LAYER...LIMITING SEVERE 
WEATHER DEVELOPMENT.

MODELS ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH THE COLD FRONT EXITING THE AREA 
MONDAY EVENING. A FEW ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DUE TO UPSLOPE 
FLOW BEHIND THE FRONT. TEMPERATURES WILL COOL SLIGHTLY MONDAY...WITH 
A GRADUAL WARMING TREND THROUGH THE REST OF THE WORK WEEK. HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL SET IN ON TUESDAY...WITH DRY WEATHER EXPECTED THROUGH 
THE REST OF THE PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR NORMAL THROUGH 
THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
EARLY THIS MORNING...DECKS OF MID TO HIGH CLOUDS CONTINUE TO STREAM
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AS AN UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE
TRACKS JUST TO THE NORTH AND WEST OF THE REGION. GIVEN THIS CLOUD
COVER...THE POTENTIAL FOR PATCHY DENSE FOG WILL BE LIMITED GIVEN
THE LESSEN RADIATIONAL COOLING. HOWEVER...SOME POCKETS OF PATCHY
FOG WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE THROUGH 12Z OR SO ALONG BODIES OF
WATER AND IN SHELTERED VALLEYS. LATER TODAY...THIS UPPER-LEVEL
DISTURBANCE MAY TRIGGER SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS /WITH THE NORTHERN TN
AND SW VIRGINIA ZONES BEING THE MOST FAVORED LOCATIONS/. WITH THE
MID/HIGH CLOUD DECKS LIFTING NORTH AND EAST BY THE AFTERNOON...
PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO REACH THE LOWER 80S
ONCE AGAIN. 

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
UPPER RIDGE AMPLIFIES EARLY 
IN THE LONG RANGE AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING TROUGH AND COLD FRONT 
MOVING EAST OUT OF THE PLAINS STATES. A NEW PLAYER IN THE WEEKEND 
WEATHER IS THE POTENTIAL TROPICAL SYSTEM CURRENTLY MOVING NORTH IN 
THE YUCATAN AND WRN CUBA VICINITY. MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON 
THIS TROPICAL SYSTEM TO TRACK NE ACROSS GA AND THE CAROLINAS...AS 
THE UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT APPROACH FROM THE WEST ON SUNDAY. 

THE CURRENT FORECAST GRIDS FIT A SENSIBLE FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND
WITH LITTLE CHANGES MADE FOR NOW. PRECIPITABLE WATER INCREASES TO 
AROUND 1.5 TO 1.75 INCHES BY LATE SUNDAY...BUT THE MAX VALUES STAY 
TO OUR SE. NOT SEEING MUCH CONCERN FOR THUNDERSTORMS OR EXCESSIVE 
RAINFALL FOR OUR AREA FOR SUNDAY NIGHT OR MONDAY. KEPT A CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS FOR SUNDAY...BUT THE SATURATED AIRMASS SEEMS TO LIMIT 
INSTABILITY EVEN DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS SUNDAY. 

ECMWF IS SLOWER THAN GFS TO DRY OUT THE AIRMASS ON TUESDAY...THUS 
MADE NO CHANGES WHERE LOW POPS WERE MENTIONED ON TUESDAY. ECMWF 
SEEMS TOO WET FOR WEDNESDAY WITH GFSX MOS POPS BELOW CLIMO BY THEN.
KEEPING WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT DRY FOR NOW. 

GFS MOS TEMPS WERE GENERALLY FOLLOWED FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.
HOWEVER...CONSIDERING THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE AHEAD OF...AND SOME 
COOLING BEHIND THE UPPER TROUGH AND COLD FRONT...I KEPT MAX TEMPS 
BELOW BOTH THE 02/12Z AND 03/00Z GFSX MOS FOR NOW ON SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY.

AREA. AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY IS 
PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHEASTWARD TONIGHT AND WEAKEN...BRINGING 
MAINLY AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE NAM MODEL 
IS MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE GFS MODEL IN CREATING SHOWERS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY WITH THIS SHORT WAVE...AND WILL COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE TWO SOLUTIONS BY MENTIONING ISOLATED SHOWERS AREA WIDE 
ON THURSDAY. OTHERWISE...A DEEP SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL KEEP DRY AND 
UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...AND WILL GENERALLY TREND 
TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND 
EXPECTED OVERALL.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...TOOK A COMBINED ECM/GFS 
APPROACH TO THE MODELS DURING THE PERIOD...FAVORING SOMETHING CLOSER 
TO THE "SLOWER" GFS SOLUTION EARLY IN THE WORK WEEK. DEEP UPPER 
TROUGH/LOW DRIVES EAST THROUGH THE PLAINS INTO THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. SYSTEM WILL BE FAR ENOUGH WEST OF THE 
REGION FOR A DRY DAY ON SATURDAY BUT LATER SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION AND LIFT AHEAD OF THE STRONG 
FRONTAL SYSTEM REQUIRES INCREASING PROBABILITY OF SHOWERS. MODELS 
INDICATE SOME INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON SUNDAY SO 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. THE DEEPEST MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL 
BE IN PLACE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WITH THE COLD FRONT BUILDING 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...THUS LIKELY POPS WERE 
MAINTAINED. THE GFS SHOWS A TRAILING SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE POSSIBLY 
SLOWING THE FRONT'S PROGRESS LATER MONDAY INTO EARLY TUESDAY SO 
KEEPING SOME CHANCE POPS IN PLACE LOOKS GOOD DURING THE EARLY PART 
OF THE WORK WEEK. SYSTEM FINALLY MOVES OUT BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON WITH 
DRY ADVECTION ALLOWING FOR A RETURN TO DRY WEATHER MUCH OF TUESDAY 
AND CONTINUING ON WEDNESDAY. STAYED CLOSER TO THE COOLER ECM 
GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR MUCH OF THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE TO THE EAST OF THE AREA WILL
CONTINUE TO PROMOTE DRY CONDITIONS TODAY AND TONIGHT. HOWEVER...THE
COMBINATION OF THE MOSTLY/PARTLY CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS HAS
RESULTED IN LOCALIZED PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT THIS MORNING...AND IS
EXPECTED TO ONCE AGAIN LATER TONIGHT. AN UPPER-LEVEL DISTURANCE
OVER TEXAS/LOUISIANA WILL DRIFT NORTH AND EAST TODAY...AND PERHAPS
SPREAD SOME MID/HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE REGION. HOWEVER...ANOTHER
PLEASANT DAY WITH MOSTLY/PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS IS STILL EXPECTED
WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER 80S IN MOST LOCATIONS ONCE AGAIN BY THIS
AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
WEAK CIRCUALTION OVER THE 
LOWER MS VALLEY REGION THIS MORNING WILL TRACK NORTH TODAY AND THEN 
NE ON THURSDAY TOWARD THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...BRINGING AN INCREASE 
IN MOISTURE TO MAINLY WRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. OPTED TO PUT 
BACK IN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR AFTERNOON SHOWERS ON THE NRN PLATEAU
AND ALSO ERN MTNS TO MESH WITH GSP AND RNK GRIDS. 

THINKING DRY EVERYWHERE FOR THURSDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS BACK OVER THE REGION. PROBABLY MORE PATCHY VALLEY 
FOG FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT WON'T ADD THAT JUST YET. THE MAIN 
PROBLEM FOR LATE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK IS STILL TIMING THE 
APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. GFS AND 
ECMWF LOOKING SLOWER THIS RUN...ALTHO STILL SUPPORTING LIKELY POPS 
BY SUNDAY NIGHT. THE SLOWER TREND LED ME TO LOWER SATURDAY AFTERNOON 
POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE...AND ALSO LOWER POPS SLIGHTLY FOR SATURDAY 
NIGHT. NUDGED MAX TEMPS UP SOME FOR SATURDAY IN LINE WITH THE SLOWER 
TIMING OF COLD FRONT AND 02/00Z GFSX MOS. 

SOME INSTABILITY ALONG THE FRONT SUNDAY EVENING...BUT LIMITED ANY 
THUNDER MENTION TO JUST SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AFTERNOONS. PERHAPS BEST 
INSTABILITY WILL BE MONDAY WITH THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH. THE COOLER AIR ALOFT AND DAYTIME HEATING WILL FAVOR 
THUNDERSTORMS...ESPECIALLY JUST TO OUR EAST OVER THE CAROLINAS. I 
DID INCREASE POPS FOR MONDAY OVER FAR NE AND EXTREME ERN AREAS...
AND ADDED A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS THERE AS WELL. DETERMING THE 
STRENGTH OR SEVERITY OF STORMS IS CHALLENGING UNTIL TIMING OF THE 
COLD FRONT AND HOW MUCH THE UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS IS CLEARER.

AFTER SUNSET. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS IN CONTROL AND WINDS
WILL BE LIGHT AND VARIABLE OVERNIGHT. ANTICIPATE ANOTHER ROUND OF
MORNING FOG AGAIN AROUND SUNRISE WITH SOME LOCATIONS EXPERIENCING
LOCALLY DENSE FOG IN THE FAVORED AREAS.

THERE IS A DEVELOPING LOW OVER SOUTHERN LOUISIANA LATE TONIGHT. THE
ASSOCIATED MOISTURE CONVERGENCE WILL REMAIN WELL WEST OF THE AREA.
EXPECT MIDDLE AND WEST TENNESSEE...NORTHWEST AL AND N MS TO SEE THE
BULK OF SHOWER ACTIVITY. BY LATE WEDNESDAY COULD SEE SOME HIGHER
LEVEL CLOUDINESS MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA IN THE AFTERNOON.
OTHERWISE...WARM AND INCREASINGLY MUGGY CONDITIONS WILL SPREAD
OVER THE REGION. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES ARE IN DECENT AGREEMENT EARLY...BUT SOME DISAGREEMENT AND 
CONTINUITY ISSUES ARISE BY THE WEEKEND AND BEYOND.  FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT AVERAGE EARLY BUT FALLS TO BELOW AVERAGE FOR 
THIS TIME OF YEAR LATE. SOME SHORT WAVE ENERGY LIFTING INTO THE 
EASTERN RIDGE WILL SLIDE BY TO OUR WEST AND NORTH THURSDAY...BUT 
LOOKS LIKE WE WILL STAY PRECIP FREE.  RIDGE BUILDS AGAIN OVER THE 
AREA FRIDAY...THEN AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL DIG TO OUR WEST AND 
TRACK SLOWLY EAST DURING THE WEEKEND/EARLY NEXT WEEK AS A COLD FRONT 
PUSHES THROUGH.  THERE ARE MODEL DISAGREEMENTS IN HANDLING 
THIS...BUT THE TREND HAS BEEN FOR A DEEPER TROUGH AND SLOWER 
MOVEMENT.  WILL SLOW THINGS DOWN AGAIN WITH THIS FORECAST AND WILL 
CARRY THE HIGHEST POPS SUNDAY NIGHT AT THIS POINT.  HOWEVER...STILL 
QUITE A BIT OF TIMING UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS.  WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED 
IF THINGS HAVE TO BE SLOWED DOWN EVEN MORE WITH LATER ISSUANCES.  
WILL GO DRY TUESDAY FOR NOW BUT OF COURSE A SLOWER MOVEMENT MAY 
CHANGE THIS.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WAS GENERALLY ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTHEASTERN

TEMPERATURES OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NE TN. EXPECT SKIES TO

432 AM EDT SUN SEP 29 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...EASTERLY FLOW AROUND THE
850 MB RIDGE IS BRINGING AREAS OF LOWER CLOUDS THIS MORNING...WHICH
SHOULD INHIBIT ANY SIGNIFICANT FOG FROM DEVELOPING. SOME SUNSHINE
SHOULD OCCUR TODAY AHEAD OF THE WEAK COLD FRONT...BUT WEAKENING OF
THE UPPER RIDGE AND AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS SUPPORT SIMILAR MOS
HIGHS.

FOR TONIGHT AND MONDAY...LIFT IS LACKING WITH THE FRONT AND THE 
UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT AFFECTS MAINLY THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS. CONVECTION OVER THE GULF COAST STATES WILL ALSO LIMIT 
THE COVERAGE OF SHOWERS ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC. THUS...KEPT POPS 
AROUND 20 PERCENT OR SO FOR BOTH PERIODS. STAYED VERY CLOSE TO GFS 
MOS FOR MIN AND MAX TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE REBUILDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA AS FRONT SETTLES SOUTH
OVER THE GULF COAST. MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS TO
PREVAIL MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ECMWF INDICATES MORE
LEFT OVER MOISTURE BEHIND FRONT WITH A FEW SHOWERS POSSIBLE
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BUT PREFER DRIER GFS WHICH KEEPS RIDGING
STRONG OVER THE EAST TN VALLEY UNTIL THURSDAY. THURSDAY ECMWF
BREAKS DOWN RIDGE AS SURFACE LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS AND UPPER
TROUGH DEEPENS. GFS KEEPS RIDGE IN PLACE ANOTHER 24 HOURS. WILL
KEEP LOW POPS IN THURSDAY AND INCREASE SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM
CHANCES FRIDAY.

GFS THEN MOVES FRONTAL SYSTEM INTO REGION FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY
SATURDAY WITH ECMWF BRINGING IN SCATTERED SHOWERS IN MOIST AIR
MASS INTO REGION BUT DEEPENS UPPER TROUGH FRIDAY TO THE WEST
SLOWING COLD FRONT DOWN AND NOT MOVING IT THROUGH FORECAST AREA
UNTIL SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP CHANCE PRECIPITATION
IN THROUGH SATURDAY SIMILAR TO ECMWF. TEMPERATURES STAY MILD
TUESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AND THEN COOLER SATURDAY WITH SHOWERS MORE
LIKELY AND MORE CLOUD COVER.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS 
THE AREA WEAKENS SOME ON SUNDAY. H85 RELATIVE HUMIDITY REMAINS 
FAIRLY HIGH THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH PERIODS OF STRATO CU DECKS. MID 
LEVELS REMAIN DRY AS UPPER LEVEL MOISTURE MOVES INTO THE AREA BY 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. LIGHT WINDS WITH TEMPERATURES CONTINUING ABOVE 
NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...LONGER TERM MODELS 
ARE IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT THROUGH MUCH OF THE FORECAST PERIOD 
TODAY. THERE ARE A COUPLE EXCEPTIONS INTO THE WEEKEND.

THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOSES ITS IDENTITY SOMETIME SUNDAY BUT THE 
WEAK NORTHWEST UPPER LEVEL FLOW MAY PROVIDE SLIGHT CHANCES FOR A FEW 
SHOWERS SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. CONFIDENCE IS VERY LOW AND MOST 
AREAS WILL LIKELY REMAIN PRECIPITATION FREE. THE ONLY EXCEPTION MAY 
BE SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA DUE TO THE POSITION OF A SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
TRANSLATING ACROSS WEST VIRGINIA. 

UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL OCCUR TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. A WEAK 
UPPER LOW MAY PROVIDE SOUTHERN AREAS WITH SOME SHOWERS BUT LOW LEVEL 
FEATURES ARE LACKING. BY THE END OF THE WEEK THERE ARE SOME TIMING 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE MODELS WHERE THE GFS IS MUCH FASTER THAN THE 
ECMWF IN REGARDS TO THE UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. SORT 
OF SPLIT THE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE MODELS AND INCREASED CHANCES FOR 
SHOWERS STARTING FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY.

325 PM EDT TUE SEP 24 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...TRANSITION PERIOD HAS 
CONTINUED TODAY AS WEATHER ACROSS FORECAST AREA DETERIORATES. CLOUDS 
WERE STEADILY INCREASING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST AHEAD OF 
DEVELOPING FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVING EAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES AND 
COMBINING WITH MOISTURE MOVING OVER A NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT ALONG 
THE GULF COAST. LONG RANGE RADAR SHOWED A LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS AND 
STORMS OVER EASTERN MS AND WESTERN AL JUST AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE 
AREA ACROSS IN SE LA AND JUST NORTH OF THE FRONT ALONG THE GULF 
COAST. THE FORECAST AREA HAD MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES NE HALF AND MOSTLY 
CLOUDY SW HALF. TEMPERATURES WERE IN THE 70S.

THE FRONT IN THE PLAINS IS EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE TN VALLEY 
OVERNIGHT AND BECOME OCCLUDED. RAIN SPREADING OUT AHEAD OF IT WILL 
MOVE INTO SOUTHEAST TN AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU THIS EVENING AND 
THEN MOVE ACROSS NE SECTIONS BY LATE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. AS THIS 
SOUTHERN SYSTEM MOVES EAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY MORE 
RAIN AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE. BY AFTERNOON THERE SHOULD 
BE A BREAK IN THE STEADY RAIN IN THE SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST. AN UPPER 
LEVEL LOW ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT WILL BRING MORE SHOWERY 
CONDITIONS LATER IN THE AFTERNOON. MILD TEMPERATURES TONIGHT WITH 
CLOUDS AND RAIN WITH BOTH MODELS CLOSE ON LOWS IN THE UPPER 50S TO 
MID 60S. UP TO THREE QUARTERS OF AN INCH COULD FALL TONIGHT IN THE 
SOUTH AND WEST AND THEN THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL SHIFTS TO THE EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA WEDNESDAY. WEDNESDAY LOWERED 
HIGHS A FEW DEGREES. MET GUIDANCE OF NEAR 70 TO MID 70S WAS 
PREFERRED BUT THAT WILL DEPEND ON A BREAK IN THE RAIN DURING THE 
AFTERNOON. MOUNTAIN TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY STAY IN THE 60S 
POSSIBLY COOLER AT THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND REVEAL A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE FOR THE END 
OF THE WEEK WITH A COLD FRONT APPROACHING DURING SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY 
TIME FRAME. A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND THURSDAY BEHIND A DEPARTING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION. DRY CONDITIONS AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS 
WILL THEN DEVELOP FOR LATE IN THE WEEK AND INTO THE WEEKEND...AS A 
HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE DEVELOPS OVER THE MS RIVER 
VALLEY. LATEST RUNS OF THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS ARE NOW DELAYING THE 
ARRIVAL OF A COLD FRONT LATE IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND THUS... 
WILL REMOVE ANY POPS FOR SUNDAY BUT WILL MENTION CHANCES FOR 
CONVECTION SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY (DUE TO THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF 
THIS COLD FRONT). AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

WILL MOVE IN AS WELL ESPECIALLY SOUTH.  WILL CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS

RATHER LIMITED SO NO THUNDER MENTION IN THE SHORT TERM. WILL 
UNDERCUT SOME MAV MAX TEMPS A BIT MAINLY SOUTH TODAY GIVEN EXPECTED 
CLOUD COVER...OTHERWISE WILL STAY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...AN UPPER LOW WILL SWING 
THROUGH THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY.  AS A RESULT...INCREASING LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE...WEAK INSTABILITY AND SUFFICIENT LIFT WILL COMBINE TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES EXTENDS ACROSS THE NE SECTION OF THE COUNTRY...INCLUDING THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. AFTER COOL TEMPERATURES THIS MORNING AND SOME LOW 
CLOUDS AND FOG IN THE NE...SKIES ARE MOSTLY SUNNY WITH TEMPERATURES 
IN THE 70S AREA WIDE. THIS TRANQUIL PATTERN WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT 
BUT CHANGES WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE REGION TUESDAY. AN OLD FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY TO THE SOUTH WITH A LOW IN THE GULF WILL MOVE NORTH WHILE A 
LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE PLAINS AND DEVELOPING FRONT WILL MOVE 
EAST. MOISTURE WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH WITH LOW CLOUDS EXPECTED 
TO MOVE INTO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE LATER TONIGHT AND POSSIBLY INTO THE 
KNOXVILLE AREA BY MORNING. MOISTURE STREAMING NORTH OVER THE OLD 
FRONT AND AHEAD OF THE FRONT TO THE WEST WILL SPREAD INTO WESTERN 
AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS WITH SHOWERS DEVELOPING AND POSSIBLY A 
THUNDERSTORM. THE AIR MASS STAYS STABLE FOR MOST OF THE DAY BUT MAY 
BECOME UNSTABLE FAR WEST OR SOUTHWEST WITH HEATING OF THE DAY. JUST 
HAVE LOW POPS WEST AND SOUTHWEST AS BEST CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION 
HOLDS OFF UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT. LOWS TONIGHT WARMEST SW WITH 
INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S NE SKIES WILL BE 
CLEAR EXCEPT FOR WHERE STEAM FOG MAY FORM...POSSIBLY RISING TO LOW 
CLOUD DECK AROUND SUNRISE. ADDED PATCHY FOG IN THE USUAL RIVER AND 
LAKE REGIONS. HIGHS TUESDAY WILL BE DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER. HAVE 
USED A BLEND OF THE MET/MAV FOR HIGHS WITH UNCERTAINTY OF HOW FAST 
CLOUDS WILL MOVE IN FROM WEST AND SOUTHWEST.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...AND REVEAL TWO MAIN WEATHER FEATURES: AN UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH ON WEDNESDAY AND A COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT. A 
FAIRLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...WITH THE MODELS 
INDICATING ENOUGH MOISTURE WITH IT TO INCLUDE LIKELY POPS FOR THIS 
PERIOD. INSTABILITY APPEARS TO BE FAIRLY WEAK OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA...SO WILL EMPHASIZE SHOWERS WITH JUST A FEW TSTORMS. AN 
AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL THEN DEVELOP OVER THE EASTERN HALF 
OF THE NATION THE REST OF THE WEEK...WITH DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED 
ALONG WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND THROUGH SATURDAY. BOTH THE ECMWF 
AND GFS MODELS REVEAL A COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
ON SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED 
ALONG AND AHEAD OF IT. THESE MODELS THEN DIVERGE AFTER SUNDAY NIGHT 
WITH THE AMPLITUDE OF THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND THIS COLD 
FRONT...WITH THE ECMWF MODEL INDICATING A MORE AMPLIFIED TROUGH (AND 
CONSEQUENTLY A WETTER SOLUTION) THAN THE GFS MODEL. FOR NOW...WILL 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THESE TWO SOLUTIONS BY MENTIONING A SLIGHT CHANCE 
OF SHOWERS ON MONDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN 
THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS 
IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THIS PERIOD BEGINS
TUESDAY MORNING WITH A WEAK UPPER RIDGE THAT HAS SLID JUST EAST OF

WEAK COLD FRONT AREA ARE MOVING TOWARD US FROM THE PLAINS. THE
FIRST CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION ARE TUESDAY AFTERNOON OVER THE
WESTERN HALF OF THE AREA. PRECIP CHANCES STICK AROUND TUESDAY NIGHT
THOUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THEN THURSDAY THE AREA SHOULD DRY OUT AS
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA. CONDITIONS LOOK DRY
UNTIL AROUND SUNDAY AS THE NEXT SYSTEM COMES TOWARD US.

RIGHT NOW FOR TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY THE SEVERE STORM 
POTENTIAL LOOKS WEAK DUE TO LACK OF INSTABILITY...HOWEVER...IF THIS 
SYSTEM IS REALLY AS DYNAMIC LOOKING AT THE MID LEVELS AS ADVERTISED 
IN THE CURRENT MODELS...IT WOULD NOT BE AT ALL SURPRISING IF 
LARGE-SCALE ASCENT WAS ABLE TO DESTABILIZE THE AIR MASS MORE.  WILL 
NEED TO MONITOR THIS SITUATION.

FOR TEMPS...HAVE GONE ON THE COOL SIDE OF MAX TEMPS...WITH THE 
LARGEST CHANGE BEING IN THE NORTHEAST ON THURSDAY...WHEN THE UPPER 
LOW WILL BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO KEEP A LARGE SUPPLY OF CUMULUS AND 
STRATOCUMULUS CLOUDS THAT WILL BOTH BLOCK THE SUN AND WILL DISSIPATE 
THE SURFACE HEATING THROUGH DEEPER CONVECTIVE MIXING.  SO WENT ABOUT 
2 CATEGORIES BELOW GUIDANCE ON THURSDAY NE OF KTRI.  WENT CLOSE TO 
MIN GUIDANCE...SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN GUIDANCE AROUND FRIDAY...AS 
RADIATIONAL COOLING SHOULD BE GOOD.  LASTLY...TRIMMED DEW POINT 
TEMPERATURES BACK 1-2 DEG ON FOR A COUPLE OF DAY...AS VALUES SEEMED 
TOO HIGH CONSIDERING THAT THE RETURN FLOW WILL BE SOMEWHAT FILTERED 
WITH A LOW IN THE GULF AND A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY DOWN THERE THAT 
WILL LIMIT THE MOVEMENT ON THE REALLY RICH GULF AIR.

MAIN AVIATION CONCERN WILL BE FOG DEVELOPMENT AT TRI TONIGHT. CLEAR 
SKY...CALM WINDS AND RELATIVELY WARM LAKES WILL SET THE STAGE FOR 
STEAM FOG DEVELOPMENT FROM BOONE LAKE. WILL HAVE LIFR CONDITIONS FOR 
A FEW HOURS AROUND SUNRISE. TYS IS A LITTLE MORE UNCERTAIN...BUT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
AFTERNOON CU WILL DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET...LEAVING MOSTLY CLEAR
SKIES AND CALM WINDS. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN PATCHY FOG ACROSS MOST
OF THE AREA...WITH AREAS OF DENSE FOG POSSIBLE NORTH AND IN THE
MOUNTAINS. WILL HAVE A MENTION OF FOG IN THE GRIDS AND ZONES...BUT
WILL HOLD OFF ON A DENSE FOG ADVISORY FOR NOW TO LET THE EVENING
SHIFT EVALUATE. LOW TEMPS NORTH WILL DROP INTO THE 40S...WITH LOWER
TO MID 50S IN MOST OTHER VALLEY LOCATIONS. TOMORROW LOOKS SUNNY
WITH SCATTERED CU...AND HIGH TEMPS REACHING THE MID 70S NORTH TO
LOWER 80S SOUTH.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
MOSTLY DRY WEATHER AND SEASONAL TEMPERATURES FOR THE LONG
TERM...OUTSIDE OF 2 RAIN CHANCES. MOISTURE MAKES A RETURN WITH
ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPING LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. THE
GFS MODEL AND NAM/GFSX MOS POPS HAVE COME INTO GOOD AGREEMENT WITH
THE LATEST ECMWF MODEL...WHICH SUPPORTS LIKELY POPS ACROSS THE SRN
THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA BY WEDNESDAY. KEEPING THE MAX TEMPS DOWN
FROM GFSX MOS FOR WEDNESDAY...WHICH WAS ALSO NOTED IN THE TREND
FROM 22/00Z TO 22/12Z GFSX MOS.

SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGING DOMINATE AFTERWARDS UNTIL A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES BY SUNDAY...BUT POSSIBLY AS LATE AS EARLY MONDAY. NOT TOO 
DETAILED JUST YET FOR TIMING THE FRONT...BUT I DID INTRODUCE SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT.

OTHERWISE...KEPT MIN AND MAX TEMPS CLOSE TO A BLEND OF THE COOLER 
ECMWF AND THE 22/12Z GFSX MOS TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE TO OUR WEST WILL 
BUILD EAST AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILD IN FROM THE NORTHWEST AND 
NORTH.  DRIER AIR WILL MOVE IN.  SHOULD SEE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY 
AND MAINLY CLEAR CONDITIONS TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE 
OVERALL SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE MORE AMPLIFIED AND SLOWER 
ECMWF WAS PREFERRED OVER THE GFS FOR MUCH OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST. 
RIDGING KEEPS THE FORECAST AREA DRY ON MONDAY BUT THE RIDGE WILL 
GIVE WAY TO A HEALTHY UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WHICH APPROACHES THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON TUESDAY. AS THE TROUGH SHIFTS EAST LATER 
TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT SURFACE LOW PRESSURE LURKING OVER THE 
WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO WILL MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS MISSISSIPPI AND 
ALABAMA. THE ECMWF SHOWS INCREASING MOISTURE OFF THE GULF WILL BE 
LIFTED IN ISENTROPIC FASHION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
GENERATING SCATTERED SHOWERS MAINLY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. 
THE WAVE WILL BE EXITING THE REGION LATER IN THE DAY WEDNESDAY BUT 
TRAILING ENERGY BUILDING SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
DEPARTING UPPER TROUGH MAY KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER AROUND 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER UPPER RIDGE SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST INTO THE 
EASTERN STATES THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY BRINGING MORE DRY WEATHER 
TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR THE LAST THREE DAYS OF THE WEEK. 
TRENDED THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST CLOSER TO ECM GUIDANCE DUE TO THE 
MID WEEK SYSTEM.

SINCE COVERAGE IS NOT SCATTERED OR EXPECTED TO BE LONG LIVED...LEFT OUT OF

MOISTURE IS PRESENT BEHIND THIS FRONT FOR SOME FOG DEVELOPMENT
EARLY IN THE MORNING. FOG LOOKS UNLIKELY AT KCHA AT THIS TIME DUE
TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER WIND SPEEDS. EXPECT VSBY AT KTYS TO DROP TO MVFR

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
PRECIP WILL BE MAKING ITS EXIT TO THE EAST OVER THE NEXT FEW 
HOURS...AND IS PROJECTED TO BE OUT OF OUR AREA AROUND 22Z. WILL 
CARRY AN EARLY EVENING PERIOD IN THE ZFP...BUT DROP ALL POPS AFTER 
00Z. CLEARING SKIES WILL FOLLOW A FEW HOURS LATER AS THE SURFACE 
FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH AXIS SWING THROUGH. FALLING DEWPOINTS AND A 
NORTH WIND WILL PREVENT MUCH FOG FROM DEVELOPING. HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE PLAINS WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA SUNDAY...PROVIDING MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES AND HIGH TEMPS IN THE 70S IN MOST SPOTS. 

LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
RIDGING WILL LIE OVER THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT 
AS HIGHER PRESSURE SLIDES FARTHER EAST AND SOUTH. WINDS WILL BE 
LIGHT AND THIS WILL ALLOW RADIATIONAL COOLING. LOWS IN THE UPPER 40S 
TO MID 50S WILL BE COMMON. MONDAY COOL HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO 
MODIFY WARMING TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES ABOVE SUNDAYS HIGHS. 

MONDAY NIGHT HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST AS NEW FRONTAL SYSTEM BEGINS 
TO MOVE INTO THE ROCKIES...AND TODAYS FRONT ALONG THE GULF COAST
BEGINS TO MOVE BACK NORTH WITH WARM AIR ADVECTION TO THE WEST AND
SOUTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. THAT MOISTURE WILL INCREASE CLOUDS
MONDAY NIGHT AND ESPECIALLY TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY. THE FRONT WILL
MOVE SLOWLY EAST ALONG THE GULF COAST. ONLY LIGHT SHOWERS ARE
EXPECTED NOW. GFS IS SOMEWHAT SLOWER THAN THE ECMWF AND BOTH MODELS
ARE TRYING TO DIG A TROUGH INTO THE REGION AS THE FRONT AND
PRECIPITATION MOVES EAST POSSIBLY EXTENDING THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS
INTO THURSDAY. FOR NOW WILL KEEP RAIN OUT THURSDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE
RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST. ANOTHER CHANGE BEGINS SATURDAY AS
RIDGE BREAKS DOWN AND NEW FRONT APPROACHES A FEW SHOWERS POSSIBLE
LATE SATURDAY WEST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST
STARTS OUT WET AS SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND SURFACE FRONT...TAPPING A
TROPICAL PLUME FROM THE PACIFIC AND NORTHERN GULF...CROSSES THE
REGION TODAY. THE BACKSIDE OF THE TROUGH CROSSES INTO NC THIS
EVENING AND SO THE RAIN WILL BE DIMINISHING FROM W TO E THIS
AFTERNOON THROUGH MIDNIGHT. SOME LOCATIONS MAY SEE OVER AN INCH OF
RAIN BUT MOST OF IT SHOULD BE OF A SOAKER VARIETY RATHER THAN
CONCENTRATED HEAVY DOWNPOURS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST 
STARTS OUT DRY AS HIGHER PRESSURED BUILDS IN BEHIND THE DEPARTED 
EASTERN STATES UPPER TROUGH. THE FAIR WEATHER MAY LAST INTO MONDAY 
NIGHT. HOWEVER...ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE 
EASTERN U.S. TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE ECMWF INDICATED MORE 
AMPLIFICATION WITH THIS FEATURE AND WAS PREFERRED OVER THE GFS. USED 
SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE MID WEEK SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD BE 
MOVING AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
MORE RIDGING IS IN STORE AT THE END OF THE LONG TERM WHICH SHOULD 
ALLOW FOR A DRY AND WARMER END OF THE WORK WEEK. BECAUSE OF THE 
SLIGHTLY DIFFERING MODELS SOLUTIONS BETWEEN THE GFS AND 
ECMWF...STAYED CLOSER TO THE COOLER ECMWF CONCERNING MAX TEMPS 
DURING THE MID WEEK UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE.

A FEW ISOLATED LIGHT SHOWERS ARE CLOSE TO OUR SW VA COUNTIES...AND 
WILL DISSIPATE ONCE DAYTIME HEATING IS LOST. TO OUR WEST...SHOWERS 
OVER WEST TN ARE MAKING SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESS...AND MODELS PROJECT 
THEY WILL REACH THE PLATEAU AROUND 08Z...GIVE OR TAKE AN HOUR. 
MAXIMUM LIFT WITH QG-FORCING AND A 40-50 KT LLJ WILL CROSS THE AREA

PRE FRONTAL SHOWERS AND FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL LIKELY EXIT THE

FEW SHOWERS JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS
AND ADJACENT AREAS OF VA AND NC SATURDAY EVENING. AS RAIN
ENDS...SKIES WILL CLEAR AND TEMPERATURES SHOULD DROP INTO THE 50S
AS DRIER AIR MASS DROPS DOWN FROM THE NW. NAM MODEL BRINGS COOL
HIGH PRESSURE FARTHER SOUTH WITH DEW POINTS DROPPING TO THE UPPER
40S AND LOWER 50S VERSUS GFS ABOUT 5 DEGREES WARMER. PREFER TO

THE CASE...THE GFS FORECAST SOUNDING IS MORE STABLE. FORCING WILL
BE LACKING BUT THERE WILL BE SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO WORK WITH.
THE CURRENT FORECAST OF SCATTERED TO ISOLATED POPS APPEARS
REASONABLE WITH NO COMPELLING EVIDENCE TO WARRANT A CHANGE. TEMPS
APPEAR ON TRACK AS WELL AND IN LINE WITH THE LATEST GUIDANCE...SO
NO UPDATE WILL BE NEEDED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE AREA 
WILL GIVE WAY TO TROUGHING OVERNIGHT...AND A COLD FRONT WILL BE 
APPROACHING LATE TONIGHT.  BEST INSTABILITY TODAY...ALBEIT STILL ON 
THE WEAK SIDE...WILL BE NORTH.  WILL CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS NORTH 
WITH SLIGHT CHANCE EXTENDING INTO CENTRAL AREAS.  WILL INCREASE POPS 
TO CATEGORICAL FAR WEST AND LIKELY ELSEWHERE EXCEPT FAR NORTHEAST 
ZONES BY LATE TONIGHT AS FRONT APPROACHES.  INSTABILITY STILL LOOKS 
WEAK OVERNIGHT SO WILL JUST CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE OF 
THUNDER.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST SOME MINOR 
TWEAKS.      

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY DRIVING A 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. TWEAKED POPS UP A TAD FOR THE 
BIG FRONTAL PUSH WHICH APPEARS LIKE IT MAY COME THROUGH WITH LIMITED 
INSTABILITY. THEREFORE...KEPT THE WIDESPREAD SHOWER LOOK TO THE 
ZONES WITH JUST A CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS. FRONTAL TIMING STILL A 
LITTLE UNCERTAIN WITH MODELS INDICATING A WAVE ON THE BOUNDARY. 
BASICALLY HAD THE HIGHEST POPS DURING THE MORNING WITH A TAPERING 
TREND AFTERNOON. JUST HELD ONTO A SLIGHT OR SMALL CHANCE POP FOR THE 
EASTERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT DUE TO UNCERTAINTY 
IN SYSTEM DEPARTURE. HOWEVER...SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY LOOKS DRY WITH 
HEIGHTS BUILDING IN THE WAKE OF THE EASTERN TROUGH. THE TUESDAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY PERIOD IS INTERESTING WITH GFS/ECMWF DISSIMILAR IN 
STRENGTH AND TIMING OF AN UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE ACROSS THE EASTERN 
U.S. THE FEATURE ENHANCES LIFT IN THE LOW LEVELS ACROSS THE GULF 
COASTAL REGION AND DEEP SOUTH WHERE ONE WOULD ASSUME THE HIGHER 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION WOULD BE LOCATED. ISENTROPIC LIFTING 
COULD GENERATE SOME LIGHT QPF ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AS 
WELL. HOWEVER...DECIDED TO KEEP POPS BELOW 15 PERCENT FOR THIS 
SYSTEM AT THIS TIME WHILE AWAITING BETTER MODEL AGREEMENT IN LATER 
RUNS. RIDGING BUILDS BEHIND THIS FEATURE ON THURSDAY SO THIS WILL BE 
A DRY DAY AS WELL WITH A SLIGHT WARMING TREND.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS
LOCATED ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THIS
BOUNDARY ALONG WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL ONCE AGAIN PRODUCE
SCATTERED SHOWERS. INSTABILITY REMAINS LIMITED SO DID NOT INCLUDE
THUNDER. CONVECTION WILL DISSIPATE SOON BEFORE SUNSET. BESIDES
CHANCES OF SHOWERS...AREAS/PATCHY FOG CAN BE EXPECTED THIS MORNING
AND AGAIN FRIDAY MORNING.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LATEST MODEL RUNS ARE IN 
BETTER AGREEMENT (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE 
PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A WET 
SCENARIO ON SATURDAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF A COLD FRONT. ON FRIDAY... 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC AND AN UPPER-LEVEL 
RIDGE WILL COMBINE TO CREATE A VERY WARM DAY WITH TEMPS AROUND TEN 
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING 
IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...EXPECT SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION TO 
DEVELOP...ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. A COLD 
FRONT WILL THEN MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY...WITH THE MODELS INDICATING SOME DEEP MOISTURE FROM THE 
WESTERN GULF ADVECTING NORTHEASTWARD AHEAD IT. THUS...IT APPEARS 
THAT SATURDAY COULD BE A FAIRLY WET DAY WITH WIDESPREAD RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS OF 1 TO 3 INCHES POSSIBLE. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE ONLY A 
WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL EMPHASIZE 
SHOWERS WITH JUST A CHANCE OF TSTORMS. THE LONG-RANGE MODELS ARE IN 
BETTER AGREEMENT THIS MORNING WITH THE STRENGTH OF THE AMPLIFIED 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND THIS FRONT...WITH MOST OF THE POST-FRONTAL 
RAIN EXPECTED TO MOVE EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNDAY. THE ECMWF 
MODEL INDICATES SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY...DUE TO CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE SOUTHEAST. 
THUS...WILL KEEP SOME SMALL CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE IS THEN PROGGED TO BUILD OVER 
THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...RESULTING IN 
DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND

OVERNIGHT RAIN CHANCE BELOW 20 PERCENT. IMPULSE MOVING THROUGH WV 
OVERNIGHT MAY AID IS SOME LIGHT RAIN SPRINKLES ACROSS NORTHERN 
AREAS. FORECAST MINS VERY CLOSE TO SREF MEAN AND LOOK GOOD. SON
   
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS MAY LINGER IN NE SECTIONS THIS EVENING...BUT 
MOST PRECIP WILL END BY 00Z AS A VORT MAX EXITS THE REGION. WEAK 
ISENTROPIC LIFT IS SHOWN BY THE MODELS TO PERSIST OVERNIGHT IN 
NORTHERN AREAS...WHICH SHOULD KEEP SIGNIFICANT CLOUD COVER OVER THAT 
AREA. WILL LEAN TEMPS TOWARD THE WARMER NAM MOS GUIDANCE TONIGHT. 

A MID-UPPER RIDGE WILL BE BUILDING OVER THE MS VALLEY 
TOMORROW...KEEPING A NW FLOW OVER THE AREA. THE NAM CONTINUES TO 
SHOW WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE NORTH WITH THIS PATTERN...BUT 
OTHER LIFTING MECHANISMS FOR PRECIP ARE LACKING. THE NAM MOS POPS 
ARE IN THE CATEGORICAL RANGE NORTH...WHICH APPEARS WAY TOO HIGH 
GIVEN THE LACK OF STRONG LIFT AND DEEP MOISTURE ADVECTION. SO WILL 
LEAN MORE TOWARD THE GFS MOS POPS...WHICH ARE IN THE CHANCE RANGE 
NORTH. THE UPPER RIDGE TO OUR WEST PROGRESSES INTO THE AREA THURSDAY 
NIGHT...WHICH SHOULD END ANY CHANCE OF PRECIP AFTER MIDNIGHT.

LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THIS PERIOD STARTS FRIDAY MORNING WITH A SHORT WAVE UPPER LEVEL
RIDGE OVER THE AREA...WITH THE SURFACE RIDGE JUST TO THE EAST OF
THE AREA...WITH THE ANTI-CYCLONIC RETURN FLOW JUST BEGINNING.
ALSO...THERE IS AN APPROACHING SHORT WAVE TROUGH LOCATED OVER THE
PLAINS WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. THE APPROACH OF THE FRONT
SLOWS AND A INVERTED TROUGH BUILDS NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF. MODELS
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT TO KEEP THE FRONT IN OR NEAR THE AREA ALL
WEEKEND. BY MONDAY...THE SYSTEM IS STARTING TO EXIT THE AREA...BUT
MIGHT HAVE SOME WRAP-AROUND / TROWAL TYPE PRECIPITATION
CHANCES...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH. ALSO...WITH THE COLD CORE UPPER
LOW NOT TOO FAR AWAY...THE AREA MAY KEEP SOME MINIMAL
INSTABILITY...ONCE AGAIN NORTH AND ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST WILL HAVE
BETTER CHANCES.

AS SLOWLY MOVING AS THIS SYSTEM IS...IT IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS TO GO 
WITH THE POPS AS HIGH AS THIS LATEST GUIDANCE FOR SATURDAY WITH POPS 
IN THE 80 PERCENT RANGE...ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE NOT NEARLY AS 
AGGRESSIVE FOR SATURDAY. IF IS SLOWS DOWN OR SPEEDS UP WITH A DRY 
SLOT SOME STATIONS COULD BE DRY THAT 12 HOUR PERIOD. 

FOR TEMPS WENT PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF 
PERIODS...AND THEN WENT 2-4 DEG COOLER FOR THE NORTHEAST FOR HIGH 
TEMPS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL PERIODS DUE TO THE COLD CORE INSTABILITY 
MIXING ANY SURFACE HEATING UPWARD.

AREA. WILL LEAN TEMPS TOWARD THE WARMER NAM MOS GUIDANCE TONIGHT. 

A MID-UPPER RIDGE WILL BE BUILDING OVER THE MS VALLEY 
TOMORROW...KEEPING A NW FLOW OVER THE AREA. THE NAM CONTINUES TO 
SHOW WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE NORTH WITH THIS PATTERN...BUT 
OTHER LIFTING MECHANISMS FOR PRECIP ARE LACKING. THE NAM MOS POPS 
ARE IN THE CATEGORICAL RANGE NORTH...WHICH APPEARS WAY TOO HIGH 
GIVEN THE LACK OF STRONG LIFT AND DEEP MOISTURE ADVECTION. SO WILL 
LEAN MORE TOWARD THE GFS MOS POPS...WHICH ARE IN THE CHANCE RANGE 
NORTH. THE UPPER RIDGE TO OUR WEST PROGRESSES INTO THE AREA THURSDAY 
NIGHT...WHICH SHOULD END ANY CHANCE OF PRECIP AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
THIS PERIOD STARTS FRIDAY MORNING WITH A SHORT WAVE UPPER LEVEL
RIDGE OVER THE AREA...WITH THE SURFACE RIDGE JUST TO THE EAST OF
THE AREA...WITH THE ANTI-CYCLONIC RETURN FLOW JUST BEGINNING.
ALSO...THERE IS AN APPROACHING SHORT WAVE TROUGH LOCATED OVER THE
PLAINS WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. THE APPROACH OF THE FRONT
SLOWS AND A INVERTED TROUGH BUILDS NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF. MODELS
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT TO KEEP THE FRONT IN OR NEAR THE AREA ALL
WEEKEND. BY MONDAY...THE SYSTEM IS STARTING TO EXIT THE AREA...BUT
MIGHT HAVE SOME WRAP-AROUND / TROWAL TYPE PRECIPITATION
CHANCES...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTH. ALSO...WITH THE COLD CORE UPPER
LOW NOT TOO FAR AWAY...THE AREA MAY KEEP SOME MINIMAL
INSTABILITY...ONCE AGAIN NORTH AND ESPECIALLY NORTHEAST WILL HAVE
BETTER CHANCES.

AS SLOWLY MOVING AS THIS SYSTEM IS...IT IS A LITTLE DANGEROUS TO GO 
WITH THE POPS AS HIGH AS THIS LATEST GUIDANCE FOR SATURDAY WITH POPS 
IN THE 80 PERCENT RANGE...ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE NOT NEARLY AS 
AGGRESSIVE FOR SATURDAY. IF IS SLOWS DOWN OR SPEEDS UP WITH A DRY 
SLOT SOME STATIONS COULD BE DRY THAT 12 HOUR PERIOD. 

FOR TEMPS WENT PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE FOR THE FIRST COUPLE OF 
PERIODS...AND THEN WENT 2-4 DEG COOLER FOR THE NORTHEAST FOR HIGH 
TEMPS FOR THE LAST SEVERAL PERIODS DUE TO THE COLD CORE INSTABILITY 
MIXING ANY SURFACE HEATING UPWARD.

WEAK SOUTHERLY WINDS ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL
PRODUCE WEAK TO MODERATE ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE AND
OHIO VALLEYS TODAY AND TONIGHT. THIS LIFT WILL GENERATE BROKEN
5-8KFT CLOUDS OVER THE AREA. ALSO...SCATTERED SHOWERS ANTICIPATED

ISENTROPIC LIFT IS THE STRONGEST. SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY MAY MOVE
INTO THE PLATEAU AND WESTERN SECTIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT

SHOW SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE HANDLING OF AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH

SOME TROPICAL MOISTURE FROM THE WESTERN GULF ADVECTING NORTHEASTWARD 
AHEAD IT. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT SATURDAY COULD BE A FAIRLY WET DAY 
WITH WIDESPREAD RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF 1 TO 2 INCHES POSSIBLE. MODEL

CANADIAN MODELS DEVELOPING A DEEPER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ON SUNDAY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...A LOW LEVEL EASTERLY 
FLOW OFF THE ATLANTIC HAS LED TO SLIGHTLY REDUCED TEMPERATURES TODAY 
ALONG WITH SOME MOISTURE AROUND 850-700 MB. THE LOWER LEVEL FLOW 
WILL GRADUALLY BECOME SOUTHERLY WITH INCREASING TEMPERATURE AND 
MOISTURE ADVECTION LATER TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. THE LOW LEVEL WARM 
ADVECTION AND A WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH MAY LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF A COUPLE SHOWERS ON WEDNESDAY...MAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS. 
LIFT IS NOT PARTICULARLY IMPRESSIVE AND THEREFORE...KEPT PROBABILITY 
OF SHOWERS LOW. HELD ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE WEDNESDAY EVENING AS THE 
FEATURE MAKES ITS WAY ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS. STAYED NEAR THE 
MIDDLE OF GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...NOT A WHOLE LOT HAS 
CHANGED IN THE IMMEDIATE LONG TERM...BUT THERE ARE CHANGES FOR THE 
WEEKEND SYSTEM. BRIEF RIDGING FOR THURSDAY FLATTENS OUT ON FRIDAY IN 
ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. TEMPS LOOK TO BE IN 
THE LOW TO MID 80S FOR MOST PLACES WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER TO 
NEAR 60S. WILL LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR A POSSIBLE AFTERNOON 
SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM FOR BOTH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  

NOW ON TO THE WEEKEND. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH IS STILL PROGGED TO 
SWING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES OVER THE WEEKEND WITH ITS ASSOCIATED 
COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH OUR AREA ON SATURDAY. YESTERDAY THE GFS 
WAS SHOWING THE FRONT MOVING THROUGH ON SATURDAY WITH CLEARING 
CONDITIONS BY LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THE 06Z RUN OF THE GFS SHOWED 
VORTICITY IN THE BASE OF THE TROUGH BECOMING CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN 
TROUGH WITH SOMEWHAT OF A CUT-OFF LOW DEVELOPING OVER OUR AREA. THIS 
IS COMPLETELY DIFFERENT FROM YESTERDAYS RUN AND WOULD SIGNIFICANTLY 
DELAY THE EXIT OF THIS FEATURE. TODAYS 12Z RUN OF THE GFS ALSO 
DEVELOPS SOMEWHAT OF A CUT OFF LOW BUT KEEPS IT MUCH FURTHER TO OUR 
SOUTH...THUS HAVING LESS OF AN IMPACT ACROSS OUR AREA THAN THE 06Z 
SOLUTION. THE ECMWF IS LINE WITH YESTERDAY'S GFS RUN...A QUICKER 
EXIT WITH NO CUT-OFF LOW. NEEDLESS TO SAY...THE MODELS ARE NOT IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS SYSTEM. REGARDLESS OF 
WHICH SOLUTION IS RIGHT...IT DOES LOOK LIKE RAIN WILL MOVE THROUGH 
OUR AREA ON SATURDAY WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE FRONT...BUT HOW QUICKLY 
IT EXITS IS YET TO BE DETERMINED. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
AROUND THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON POPS PAST 
SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY DRY FOR NOW WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BACK IN BEHIND THIS WEEKENDS SYSTEM. TEMPS 
AND CLOUDS WITH THE WEEKEND SYSTEM ARE TRICKY DUE TO THE 
AFOREMENTIONED REASONS. FOR NOW...WILL TREND A TAD COOLER THAN 
GUIDANCE IS SUGGESTING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...COLD FRONT CURRENTLY 
ALONG A LINE JUST SOUTH OF TRI EXTENDING WEST TO NEAR CSV WITH SOME 
ISOLATED SPRINKLES...POSSIBLY A LIGHT SHOWER OCCURRING JUST BEHIND 
THE SURFACE FRONT. AIRMASS IS CERTAINLY LACKING MOISTURE AND 
WOULDN'T EXPECT MUCH IN THE WAY OF MEASURABLE RAIN TONIGHT. 
HOWEVER...THERE MAY BE A SHOWER IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS EXTREME 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AS THE FRONT BUILDS 
SOUTH SO INCLUDED HERE. LOOKS LIKE A FAIR AMOUNT OF SC BEHIND THE 
FRONT TONIGHT SO KEPT SKIES MOSTLY CLOUDY. FOG PROBABLY WON'T BE 
MUCH OF A PROBLEM BUT THERE COULD BE SOME PATCHY LIGHT FOG MAINLY 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. ON TUESDAY THE 
LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMES SOUTHEASTERLY AROUND THE WEDGE SURFACE HIGH 
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND OROGRAPHIC 
LIFT COULD SPARK A SHOWER IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER AND ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ON TUESDAY. 
ANOTHER WAVE WITH INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION ON LOW LEVEL 
SOUTHERLY COMPONENT MAY PROVIDE FOR A LIGHT SHOWER MAINLY ACROSS THE 
SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. TRENDED MIN 
TEMPS CLOSER TO THE MILDER MET TEMPS TONIGHT WHILE STAYING IN THE 
MIDDLE OF MET/MAV GUIDANCE FOR MAXES ON TUESDAY AND ALSO FOR MINS 
TUESDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...GENERALLY SOUTHERLY FLOW 
AT 850MB AND THE SURFACE WILL CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY AND HELP TO 
SLOWLY INCREASE DEWPOINTS FROM SOUTH TO NORTH. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR 
THE CHANCE OF DIURNAL CONVECTION EACH DAY. UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO 
FLATTEN OUT ON WEDNESDAY WITH RIDGE AXIS MOVING OFF TO OUR EAST DUE 
TO A PROGRESSIVE UPPER LEVEL FLOW. AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION OVER THE WEEKEND AND ITS ASSOCIATED 
FRONT LOOKS TO MOVE THROUGH OUR AREA DURING THE FRIDAY 
NIGHT/SATURDAY TIME-FRAME. OUR BEST CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED WILL BE WHEN THIS FEATURE MOVES THROUGH ON 
FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY. MODELS SHOW THE FRONT MOVING THROUGH FAIRLY 
QUICKLY AND EXITING OUR AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. 
THIS SHOULD ALLOW FOR A NICE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AFTER EARLY MORNING 
CLOUD COVER PUSHES OFF TO THE EAST WITH THE FRONT. AS OF NOW...A 
PLEASANT MONDAY IS IN STORE AS THE FRONT WILL BE WELL TO OUR SOUTH 
BY THIS TIME AND RIDGING STARTS TO BUILD BACK IN. TEMPS WILL REMAIN

.AVIATION...A WEAK COOL FRONT IS MOVING THROUGH SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
AT THE CURRENT HOUR AND WILL BE SLIPPING SOUTH TO NEAR THE GEORGIA
AND ALABAMA BORDER BY MID EVENING. ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE
ACCOMPANYING THE FRONTAL PUSH WITH CEILINGS BEHIND THE FRONT AROUND
4-5 THOUSAND FEET. WILL NOT INCLUDE MENTION OF RAIN AT ANY OF THE
TERMINALS DUE TO THE RATHER LOW PROBABILITY OF OCCURRENCE. KEPT
FLIGHT WEATHER VFR AT TYS AND CHA WITH SOME LIGHT FOG AROUND
DAYBREAK. HOWEVER...TRI MAY SEE AN MVFR CEILING AND VISIBILITY
DEVELOP LATER TONIGHT AS THE LOWER LEVELS BECOME SATURATED BEHIND
THE FRONT. WOULD EXPECT VFR CONDITIONS TO RETURN AT TRI BY 16Z AS
THE LOWER LAYER MIXES OUT.

.DISCUSSION...COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS MAKING ITS WAY SOUTH TOWARD
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS MORNING. CURRENTLY SITUATED
FROM NEAR JKL TO OWB IN KENTUCKY. RADAR COMPOSITE SHOWS A FEW
SHOWERS ALONG THE LINE. MODELS DON'T REALLY LIKE THE IDEA OF TOO
MUCH RAIN IN THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND THAT FORECAST LOOKS PRETTY
GOOD. HOWEVER...INITIALLY THERE MAY BE A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE FOR
A SHOWER ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGH MID DAY AND MAY ADD A
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.
WILL PROBABLY ADD A SPRINKLE TO THE CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE
FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON. SATELLITE INDICATES A WIDESPREAD AREA
OF BROKEN TO OVERCAST SC VICINITY ALONG AND BEHIND THE FRONT AND
THIS SHOULD IMPACT HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR NORTHERN SECTIONS. WILL
NOT ADJUST ZONES AS CURRENT FORECAST HAS SOME NICE TEMPERATURE
RANGES WHICH SHOULD WORK WELL TODAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FOR THIS MORNING...PATCHY FOG CAN
BE EXPECTED..ESPECIALLY NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS.

AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEAST
WILL PULL A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. CURRENTLY FRONT IS
LOCATED NEAR THE OHIO RIVER PRODUCING SCATTERED SHOWERS. MODELS
SHOW THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SLOWLY
MOISTENING...BUT MID-LEVEL INVERSION WILL KEEP INSTABILITY VERY
LIMITED. ALSO...ANY UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WITH TROUGH WILL STAY WELL
NORTH AND EAST OF THE AREA..SO ONLY SLIGHT POPS AT BEST FOR TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...DRIER AIR WILL ONCE AGAIN ADVECT INTO THE AREA
PRODUCING PARTLY CLOUDY/MOSTLY CLEAR SKY WITH PATCHY FOG.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS 
THE REGION FOR THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK. SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS WILL HELP 
TO DRAW BACK SOME GULF MOISTURE INTO THE REGION AND ALLOW FOR SOME 
ISOLATED CONVECTION ON TUESDAY AND SCATTERED STORMS ON WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY AS THE RIDGE BEGINS TO FLATTEN AND MOVE TO THE SOUTHWEST BY 
FRIDAY. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH PROGRESSING EASTWARD OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY WILL SEND A COLD FRONT INTO WESTERN/MIDDLE 
TENNESSEE ON FRIDAY AND EVENTUALLY THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS FRIDAY 
NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR SOME EVEN BETTER CHANCES 
FOR MORE ORGANIZED CLUSTERS OF STORMS LATE IN THE WEEK. THE FRONT 
SHOULD CLEAR THE AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH RIDGING SLOWLY 
BUILDING BACK IN FOR SUNDAY. HIGHS WILL REMAIN FAIRLY STEADY IN THE 
LOW TO PERHAPS MID 80S FOR MUCH OF THE UPCOMING WEEK...WITH PERHAPS 
SOME SLIGHT COOLER READINGS THIS WEEKEND.

NIGHT IN STORE WITH TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN LAST 
NIGHT. A FEW AREAS OF PATCHY FOG ARE AGAIN POSSIBLE TOMORROW 
MINORING...ESPECIALLY NEAR ANY BODIES OF WATER. HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO MOVE OFF TO OUR EAST OVERNIGHT IN ADVANCE OF AN 
APPROACHING TROUGH ON MONDAY. THE TROUGH SWINGS DOWN ACROSS THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY BUT WILL MAINLY STAY TO OUR NORTHEAST. ITS ASSOCIATED 
FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH THROUGH OUR AREA DURING THE DAY ON MONDAY. A 
LACK OF FORCING WILL RESULT IN A MOSTLY DRY FRONTAL PASSAGE. WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS PORTIONS OF NE TN AND SW VA. A BRIEF 
RETURN TO NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT AND FRONTAL 
PASSAGE. CLOUDS WILL ADVANCE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH WITH THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE AND RESULT IN MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS FOR MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND NORTHWARD. 
WEAK RIDGING RETURNS ON TUESDAY...BUT TEMPERATURES AND DEWPOINTS 
WILL BE SUPPORTIVE OF POSSIBLE DIURNAL CONVECTION DURING THE 
AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...FLAT UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
BUILDS INTO THE EASTERN STATES THROUGH MID WEEK AS WEAK SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY COMBINES WITH AN INCREASINGLY SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL COMPONENT 
TO THE FLOW. THE INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE SHOULD LEAD TO THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF WIDELY SCATTERED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW 
THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. MODELS CONTINUE TO PORTRAY 
DIFFERING SPEED TO A HEALTHY LONG WAVE TROUGH AS IT SHIFTS ACROSS 
THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. FRONTAL 
TIMING WITH THIS SYSTEM IN QUESTION LATE IN THE WEEK SO MAINTAINED 
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST SCENARIO WHICH PLACES THE HIGHEST POPS FOR 
FRONTAL CONVECTION ON FRIDAY NIGHT. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY IN SYSTEM 
TIMING WITH POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER WAVE ON THE SOUTHERN END OF THE 
COLD FRONT SLOWING FROPA...KEPT MEDIUM AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING 
THROUGH THE END OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST.

SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. SINCE THE

THE IMMEDIATE SHORT TERM. OVERNIGHT TEMPS WILL BE SLIGHTLY WARMER 
THAN LAST NIGHT BUT STILL WELL BELOW SEASONAL AVERAGES. WINDS SHOULD 
BE A LITTLE CALMER TONIGHT WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR A FEW PATCHY AREAS

RETURNS SUNDAY AND WILL ALLOW FOR TEMPS AND DEWPOINTS TO REBOUND. 
ANOTHER TROUGH BEGINS TO APPROACH THE REGION ON MONDAY. THE HEART OF 
THE TROUGH SHOULD STAY TO OUR NORTHEAST BUT ITS ASSOCIATED FRONT 
WILL MOVE SOUTH THROUGH OUR AREA SOMETIME ON MONDAY 
AFTERNOON/EVENING. CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE ON MONDAY AS 
MOISTURE INCREASE AT ALL LEVELS...BUT A LACK OF LIFT WILL PREVENT 
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS. SO ONLY A FEW SPOTTY SHOWERS AND A POSSIBLE 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM IS ANTICIPATED AT THIS TIME. WILL GO SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR PORTIONS OF NE TN AND SW VA.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...STAYED CLOSE TO 
PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH FEATURES LOW PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION 
THROUGH MOST OF THE WEEK WITH THE ATMOSPHERE ONLY SLOWLY MOISTENING

CONVERGING ON A SCENARIO WHICH INCLUDES THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER COLD 
FRONT FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. BEST FRONTAL TIMING AT THIS TIME APPEARS 
TO BE FRIDAY NIGHT SO ADJUSTED POPS A LITTLE HIGHER TO MEDIUM CHANCE 
RANGE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THIS PERIOD WHILE 
DROPPING BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE BY SATURDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR POSSIBLE 
SLOWER FRONTAL MOVEMENT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL BE THE MAIN WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH
TONIGHT. THIS MORNING AND AND AGAIN EARLY SUNDAY MORNING...PATCHY
FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE...MAINLY NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS DUE TO STEAM
FOG. OTHERWISE...A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY EXPECTED. GENERALLY FOLLOWED A
COMPROMISE OF MAV/MET GUIDANCE DUE TO BETTER PERFORMANCE.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL REMAIN CENTERED OVER THE REGION ON 
SUNDAY...PROMOTING SUNNY AND DRY CONDITIONS...BUT STILL MAINTAINING 
A SLIGHTLY COOLER AUTUMN-LIKE AIRMASS. AN UPPER-TROUGH WILL THEN 
SHIFT FROM THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEAST U.S. ON MONDAY AND 
PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION. THIS FRONT WILL DO LITTLE 
TO PRODUCE ANY MEANINGFUL OPPORTUNITIES FOR PRECIPITATION OR EVEN 
CHANGE TEMPERATURES. IN FACT...IN WAKE OF THE FRONT ADDITIONAL 
RIDGING AND A MORE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT SHOULD RESULT IN SOME PLEASANT 
WEATHER FOR MOST OF THE WORK WEEK. HOWEVER...SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE WILL HELP TO RESTORE GULF MOISTURE INTO THE 
REGION...AND ALLOW FOR SOME ISOLATED TO PERHAPS SCATTERED DIURNALLY 
DRIVEN CONVECTION TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. BY THE END OF THE WEEK 
ANOTHER COLD FRONT MAY IMPACT THE REGION...SO HAVE INCREASED POPS 
SLIGHTLY ON THURSDAY. HOWEVER...MODELS DIFFER IN THE TIMING AND 
INTENSITY OF THIS SYSTEM SO HAVE KEPT POPS AT LOW-END CHANCE FOR 
FRIDAY AS WELL AND WILL WAIT FOR BETTER MODEL CONTINUITY AS THIS 
SYSTEM IS STILL A WEEK OUT. ADDITIONALLY...WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING BACK IN HIGHS WILL CLIMB BACK INTO THE MID 80S BY THE

SKIES ARE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER
60S TO LOWER 70S NORTH TO THE MID 70S TO LOWER 80S CENTRAL AND
SOUTH WITH DEW POINTS IN THE COMFORTABLE LOWER TO MID 50S. SURFACE
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES CONTINUES TO
BUILD SOUTHEAST TONIGHT AND SATURDAY PROVIDING MUCH COOLER NIGHTS
AND MOSTLY SUNNY COOLER AFTERNOONS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. STEAM FOG
IS EXPECTED AT/NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS LATE TONIGHT AND AGAIN
SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING. SKIES WILL OTHERWISE BE MOSTLY CLEAR
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE THE COLDEST SO FAR THIS
LATE SUMMER OR EARLY FALL WITH LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 40S HIGHER
ELEVATIONS AND NORTHEAST VALLEYS TO THE LOWER TO MID 50S LOWER
ELEVATIONS. SATURDAY HIGHS WILL BE MOSTLY IN THE 70S TO NEAR 80 AT
CHA THEN WARMING A FEW DEGREES SUNDAY. SATURDAY NIGHT LOWS WILL BE
SIMILAR TO TONIGHTS ALTHOUGH A FEW DEGREES WARMER SOUTH.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A LONG WAVE TROUGH 
MIGRATES EAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION SUNDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT DROPS THROUGH 
THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY BUT MOISTURE IS RATHER LIMITED AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT SO KEPT MOST OF THE REGION DRY WITH THIS FROPA. SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS SOUTHEAST TO THE ATLANTIC COAST THROUGH MID 
WEEK CAUSING THE LOW LEVEL FLOW TO TURN SOUTHERLY ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY THROUGH THE WEEK. AS THE 
LOW LEVELS MOISTEN...THERE WILL BE A SMALL CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WITH DEVELOPMENT MAINLY ON THE HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES 
INITIALLY. WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY THE CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DRIVES 
EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN U.S. A COLD FRONT BUILDS TOWARD THE REGION 
LATE IN THE PERIOD BUT MODELS ARE NOT ALL ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE 
LATE WEEK SCENARIO. IN FACT...THE ECMWF IS ABOUT AN ENTIRE DAY AHEAD 
OF THE GFS WITH THE SYSTEM PASSAGE. THEREFORE...CONFIDENCE NOT TOO 
HIGH FOR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK FRONTAL TIMING. STAYED CLOSER TO A 
MEX/ECM BLEND FOR TEMPERATURES DURING THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...EARLY THIS MORNING COLD FRONT WAS
LOCATED ACROSS SOUTHEAST KENTUCKY. MODELS SHOW THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
MOVING SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING ENDING CHANCES OF SHOWERS.
MAIN CONCERN IN THE VERY SHORT TERM IS THE AREAS OF DENSE FOG. AREA
OBSERVATIONS AND WEBCAMS SHOW AREAS OF FOG ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF
OF EAST TENNESSEE..SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.
COVERAGE IS NOT EXTENSIVE ENOUGH TO WARRANT AN ADVISORY..BUT HAVE
INCLUDED PATCHY DENSE FOG IN THE FORECAST AND NOWCAST.

FOG AND LOW CLOUDS WILL MIX OUT BY MID-MORNING AS DRIER AIR ADVECTS
INTO THE REGION WITH PARTLY CLOUDY SKY ANTICIPATED THIS AFTERNOON. 

FOR TONIGHT...SURFACE RIDGING WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA WITH A COOL
NIGHT IN STORE. STEAM FOG IS EXPECTED AT/NEAR AREA LAKES AND
STREAMS LATE.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...
A COOLER AUTUMN-LIKE AIR MASS WILL SETTLE INTO THE REGION ON SATURDAY 
AS HIGHS WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB MUCH ABOVE THE UPPER 70S TO AROUND 
80 DEGREES. A FLAT SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE SOUTH WILL CONTINUE TO 
BUILD IN DURING THE WEEKEND...PROMOTING MOSTLY CLEAR AND DRY 
CONDITIONS. HOWEVER...AN UPPER-TROUGH PASSING WELL TO THE NORTH WILL 
PUSH A WEAK FRONT THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY INTO TUESDAY WHICH COULD 
ALLOW FOR PERHAPS SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
THEREAFTER...SUBTROPICAL RIDGING BUILDS BACK IN AND A FAIRLY ZONAL 
FLOW WILL PREVAIL ALOFT. WINDS WILL SHIFT BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST BY 
WEDNESDAY AND ALLOW FOR GULF MOISTURE TO FILTER INTO THE AREA. THIS 
WILL CREATE SOME HIGHER CHANCES FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION /ESPECIALLY 
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN/ ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...THOUGH MOST 
LOCATIONS WILL PROBABLY STAY DRY. ADDITIONALLY...WITH INCREASED 
THICKNESS VALUES/TEMPERATURES ALOFT...HIGHS WILL CLIMB BACK INTO THE

REGION DURING THE LATE AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING. THERE MAY BE A
FEW STRONG STORMS WITH DAMAGING WINDS. THIS ACTIVITY WILL MOVE
THROUGH QUICKLY AND DECREASE RAPIDLY IN INTENSITY AS AIR MASS
COOLS. FOLLOWED YESTERDAYS PERSISTENCE FOR HIGHS NEAR 90 SOUTH AND
CENTRAL AND UPPER 80S NE TN. TONIGHT CLOUDS WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES
UP INTO THE UPPER 60S TO NEAR 70 SOUTHEAST AND CENTRAL VALLEY AND
NEAR 60 TO THE LOWER 60S NE. RAIN CHANCES INCREASE AS FRONT NEARS
THIS AFTERNOON THEN DECREASES AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING INTO THE REGION FROM THE NW FRIDAY. LINGERING LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE AND UPPER IMPULSE IN NW FLOW COULD INITIATE SOME SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE TN MNTS FRIDAY. THICKNESS VALUES FALL FRI NIGHT WITH 
BELOW NORMAL MORNING LOWS INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. DRY MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES WILL LEAD TO GOOD DAY TIME WARM UPS. SOME LOW LEVEL CLOUDS 
WILL STACK AGAINST SOUTHERN MNTS AND MAY BLEED INTO SE TN AS SURFACE 
RIDGE SLIDES EAST OF THE AREA. ANOTHER WEAK FRONT MOVES SOUTHEAST 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY MONDAY AND MOVES THROUGH THE AREA BY 
TUESDAY. AVAILABLE MOISTURE WITH THIS FRONT IN QUESTION...SO KEPT 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES LOW. TEMPERATURES THROUGH MID WEEK NEAR OR 
SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...CONVECTION FORMED 
ACROSS THE NRN PLATEAU...SE KY AND SWRN VA THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
CONTINUES TO DRIFT SLOWLY SE. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS POSSIBLE...BUT
THIS ACTIVITY WON'T GET VERY FAR SOUTH BEFORE SUNSET. I TWEAKED POPS 
JUST A BIT TO ALLOW THIS CONVECTION TO REACH THE CENTRAL VALLEY 
COUNTIES AND SMOKIES. STILL LOOKED SAFE TO DROP RAIN CHANCES AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...WITH AN ADDITION OF PATCHY FOG LATE IN THE VALLEYS OR 
WHERE RAIN OCCURS TODAY.

BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON THE COLD FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING SE KY AND 
SW VA...SO KEPT THE PREVIOUS LIKELY POPS FOR THOSE AREAS. PASSING OF 
FRONT SHOULD INCREASE SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER SE AREAS THURSDAY 
EVENING...WITH SHOWERS ENDING BEFORE DAYBREAK FRIDAY. JUST A FEW 
ADJUSTMENTS TO GRIDS FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. GENERALLY 
FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS...BUT TRENDED CLOSER TO THE 
HIGHER NAM/MET MOS POPS. 


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...BY THE START OF THIS PERIOD 
ON FRIDAY MORNING THE COLD FRONT WILL BE CLEAR OF THE AREA...WITH 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE STARTING TO BUILD IN.  DRIER AIR IS EXPECTED 
WITH THE CHANGE OF AIR MASSES...SHOULD FEEL THE FIRST TOUCH OF FALL 
SATURDAY MORNING.  EASTERN CANADIAN TROUGH HANGS TOUGH AND STILL HAS 
AN INFLUENCE ON OUR AREA...AS WE REMAIN IN AN UPPER NW FLOW INTO THE 
WEEKEND...WITH A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVE TROUGHS WITHIN THIS FLOW.  
HOWEVER...WITH MINIMAL MOISTURE...THINK THESE SHORT WAVES WILL ONLY 
RESULT IN SUBTLE REINFORCING SHOTS OF COOL AIR FOR THIS WEEKEND.

BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...THE EASTERN CANADA TROUGH SWINGS TO THE EAST 
ALLOWING FOR RIDGING OVER OUR AREA.  MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
WITH THIS SCENARIO...WITH THE EURO SHOWING A STRONGER RIDGE.  

WILL KEEP NEXT WEEK MOSTLY DRY.  GFS PUTTING SOME LIGHT PRECIP 
OVER OUR AREA...BUT IT IS OBVIOUS THAT THE FOCUS FOR ORGANIZED 
PRECIP IS EITHER WELL TO THE SOUTH OR TO THE WEST AND NORTH.  ONLY A 
FEW ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SHOWING SOME LIGHT PRECIP OVER OUR AREA.  WITH 
THE CURRENT DRY TREND OVER THE LAST COUPLE OF WEEKS...AM LEANING 
THAT WAY WITH THESE EXTENDED PERIODS. 

FOR OTHER PARAMETERS...KEEPING DEW POINTS ON THE LOW SIDE OF 
GUIDANCE...THINKING THAT WE WILL NOT GET A REAL RETURN FLOW WITH 
THIS SCENARIO...RATHER IN EARLY TO MID NEXT WEEK...BACK DOOR FRONT 
EAST OF APPALACHIANS WILL HAVE ITS AIR SEEP AROUND AND INTO OUR AREA 
FROM THE SOUTH...BUT NOT REALLY TAPPING THE RICHER GULF AIR.  WITH 
THAT IN MIND FOLLOWED MOS MAX TEMPS PRETTY CLOSELY THIS RUN AS THEY 
ARE WARMER THAN LAST RUN...WITH DRIER DEW POINTS...EXPECTING WARMER 
MAX TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO SIT OVER THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THIS AFTERNOON...
AND HAS PROMOTED A VERY WARM...DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY DAY. SOME
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED STORMS WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE LATER THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...THOUGH THEY SHOULD GENERALLY REMAIN
CONFINED TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA. TONIGHT...SOME PATCHY FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE NEAR AREA
LAKES AND RIVERS GIVEN THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS...BUT IT
WILL QUICKLY DISSIPATE AFTER SUNRISE.

AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL BEGIN TO FLATTEN
THE RIDGE...AND ALLOW FOR SOME HIGHER CHANCES FOR SCATTERED
CONVECTION BY THE AFTERNOON AS TEMPERATURES ALOFT COOL. GIVEN THE
DEEP GULF MOISTURE IN PLACE...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL ALONG WITH
LIGHTNING WILL BE THE BIGGEST IMPACT FROM THIS ACTIVITY.
HOWEVER...GIVEN SOME INSTABILITY IN PLACE A FEW OF THESE STORMS MAY
BECOME STRONG AND BE CAPABLE OF GUSTY WINDS AS WELL. HIGH TOMORROW
WILL BE COOLER BY A DEGREE OR TWO GIVEN THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER
BUT WILL STILL REACH THE UPPER 80S TO AROUND 90 IN MOST VALLEY
LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
AN UPPER TROUGH WILL BE DROPPING SE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON 
THURSDAY...PUSHING A SURFACE COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. 
THURSDAY WILL FEATURE CONTINUED WARM TEMPS IN THE 85-90 RANGE WITH 
AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...MAINLY FOCUSED IN HIGHER 
TERRAIN AS SYNOPTIC FORCING REMAINS WEAK DURING THE DAY. FORCING FOR 
LIFT BECOMES STRONGER AROUND 00Z FRIDAY IN NORTHERN AREAS AS THE 
UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES...ALONG WITH A PRE-FRONTAL SURFACE TROUGH. 
STILL...MOISTURE IS LIMITED WITH A W-NW FLOW ALOFT...AND THE GFS 
REMAINS WEAKER WITH LIFT THAN THE NAM. AS A RESULT...WILL KEEP POPS 
IN THE CHANCE RANGE...WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES NORTH. MODELS HAVE 
TRENDED A BIT SLOWER WITH THE COLD FRONT...SO WILL KEEP A SLIGHT 
CHANCE IN THE SOUTHERN HALF FRIDAY MORNING. LOWER DEWPOINTS WILL 
BUILD IN BEHIND THE FRONT THROUGH THE DAY ON FRIDAY. 

THE WEEKEND WILL FEATURE COOLER TEMPS AND A DRY AIR MASS AS HIGH 
PRESSURE SETTLES OVER THE OHIO AND TN VALLEY REGIONS. THE ECMWF MOS 
WAS FOLLOWED CLOSELY FOR TEMPS...WHICH IS COOLER THAN THE GFS. HIGH 
IN MOST SPOTS WILL BE IN THE 70S TO LOWER 80S...WITH LOWS IN THE 50S 
AND A FEW SPOTS IN THE 40S NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. WILL CONTINUE

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS THE DOMINATE WEATHER
FEATURE ACROSS THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON...AND IT HAS PROMOTED
ANOTHER WARM AND PARTLY SUNNY LATE SUMMER DAY ACROSS THE REGION.
HOWEVER...A WEAKNESS IN THIS RIDGE HAS ALLOWED A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH TO SLIP INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND TRIGGER SOME ISOLATED TO
LOCALLY SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. WITH POCKETS OF ENHANCED INSTABILITY NOTED IN
THIS AREA...SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY MAY PRODUCE SOME LIGHTNING AND
PERHAPS BRIEF GUSTY WINDS. HOWEVER...LOCALLY HEAVY DOWNPOURS WILL
BE THE PRIMARY IMPACT FROM ANY CONVECTION THAT DOES DEVELOP. MOST
OF THIS ACTIVITY WILL REMAIN CONFINED TO THE PLATEAU...SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SHOULD DIMINISH AFTER
SUNSET THIS EVENING.

MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW FOR PATCHY FOG TO
DEVELOP ONCE AGAIN ACROSS THE REGION AFTER MIDNIGHT...BUT IT WILL
QUICKLY DIMINISH AFTER SUNRISE TOMORROW. SOME SLIGHTLY BETTER
CHANCES FOR SOME DIURNALLY DRIVEN ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION
WILL BE IN PLACE BY THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS MOISTURE
INCREASES UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE. 

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
PRECIP CHANCES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WILL BE RISING AS THE UPPER 
RIDGE RETROGRADES AND A TROUGH BEGINS TO DROP INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION. WITH A LACK OF WELL DEFINED SYNOPTIC FORCING...CONVECTION ON 
WEDNESDAY WILL BE MAINLY DIURNAL AND FAVOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. 
COVERAGE LOOKS TO BE A BIT MORE EXTENSIVE FOR THURSDAY AHEAD OF A 
COLD FRONT THAT MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY REGION...WITH THE BEST 
CHANCES NORTH. MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON THIS FRONT MOVING INTO 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF OUR AREA ON THURSDAY NIGHT...AND EXITING 
SOUTHERN AREAS FRIDAY MORNING. A NICE PUSH OF DRIER AIR FOLLOWS THE 
FRONT...WHICH SHOULD PRODUCE LOWS FRIDAY NIGHT IN THE 50S IN MOST 
SPOTS. THE WEEKEND LOOKS DRY AND SUNNY WITH TEMPS NEAR TO SLIGHTLY 
BELOW NORMAL AS A RIDGE MOVES OVER THE REGION. THE PATTERN BECOMES 
MORE PROGRESSIVE...AND THE RIDGE MOVES TO OUR EAST LATE SUNDAY. THE 
GFS AND ECMWF HAVE SHOWN A COLD FRONT APPROACHING ON MONDAY FOR THE 
PAST COUPLE OF MODEL RUNS...SO WILL INTRODUCE MONDAY WITH A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP.

DAYTIME HEATING BEGINNING TO TAKE EFFECT AND THUS ANOTHER FAIRLY
BENIGN DAY WEATHER WISE IS ON TAP ACROSS THE REGION TODAY. AN
UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AREA REMAINS THE DOMINANT

HOWEVER...THERE IS A WEAKNESS IN THE RIDGE AND AN UPPER SHORTWAVE
PROGRESSING SOUTHEAST ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THIS HAS TRIGGERED
SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER WESTERN/MIDDLE TENNESSEE THIS
MORNING WHICH COULD CLIP THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE THIS AFTERNOON. ADDITIONALLY...SOME DIURNALLY DRIVEN

THE GREATER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION AS A WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVES

SUNSET. OVERNIGHT TEMPS WILL BE ONE TO TWO DEGREES WARMER THAN LAST
NIGHT. SOME AREAS WILL SEE PATCHY FOG AGAIN OVERNIGHT...WITH FOG DEVELOPING
AFTER MIDNIGHT AND TOWARD EARLY MORNING. FOG SHOULD BEGIN TO CLEAR
BETWEEN 9AM AND 10AM EST. HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR WEST WILL CONTINUE TO
SHIFT EAST OVERNIGHT AND THROUGH TOMORROW. THIS WILL RESULT IN A
RETURN TO A SOUTHERLY FLOW IN THE LOW LEVELS AND HELP TO SLOWLY
INCREASE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF DIURNAL CONVECTION
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS TOMORROW. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ROUGHLY 5
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL AREA-WIDE DUE TO BUILDING HIGH PRESSURE.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL CONTINUE BUILD INTO THE REGION THROUGH THE
MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...RESULTING IN A MOSTLY WARM FORECAST FOR THE
EXTENDED PERIOD AS DAYTIME HIGHS WILL PEAK IN THE MID 80S TO AROUND
90 DEGREES FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...SOME GULF MOISTURE
WILL FEED UP UNDERNEATH THE RIDGE AND ALLOW FOR SOME LOW CHANCES
FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION TO DEVELOP. ON
WEDNESDAY...AN UPPER-TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES WILL
DROP A COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AS THE RIDGE BEGINS TO
FLATTEN AND EVENTUALLY SPLIT INTO TWO PARTS BY THURSDAY AS EACH
PART MOVES TO THE EAST AND WEST OF THE REGION. THE COLD FRONT WILL
THEN MOVE SOUTH INTO THE REGION ON THURSDAY...GIVING THE AREA THE
BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION THIS WEEK. MODELS ARE NOW HINTING
THAT THIS FRONT MAY BE A LITTLE SLOWER TO CLEAR THE AREA.
THUS...HAVE CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
ACROSS THE EASTERN/SOUTHERN HALF OF THE CWA ON FRIDAY BEFORE
TAPERING THEM OFF BY FRIDAY MORNING AS THE FRONT EXITS THE AREA. A
MORE AUTUMN-LIKE COOLER AIR MASS WILL BE WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE

753 PM EDT SAT SEP 7 2013

.AVIATION...ANOTHER FORECAST PERIOD FEATURING MOSTLY VFR WEATHER
CONDITIONS FOR FLIGHT OPERATIONS. SHORT WAVE DROPPING SOUTHEAST
THROUGH THE NORTHEASTERN STATES AND A COOL FRONT WILL BRING A MIX
OF CI AND AC TO THE TERMINALS ON SUNDAY. GENERALLY FAIR WX CU WILL
ALSO BE PRESENT AS HEATING GETS UNDERWAY AND THE TERRAIN MAY BE
ABLE TO AID THE FORMATION OF A COUPLE SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM
MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.
STILL...PROBABILITY A BIT TOO LOW FOR MENTION AT TRI SO LEFT OUT.
THE MAIN ISSUE FOR AVIATORS WILL BE THE LIKELIHOOD OF FOG FORMATION
AGAIN LATE TONIGHT. EXPECT SOME IFR CONDITIONS AT THE TERMINALS AND
EVEN LIFR RESTRICTIONS AT TYS AND TRI AROUND THE 08-12Z TIME FRAME.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER HIGH CENTERED OVER 
CENTRAL HIGH PLAINS WITH UPPER TROUGH STILL IN EASTERN 
CANADA...COMBINING FOR A NORTHWESTERLY UPPER FLOW OVER OUR AREA.  BY 
TOMORROW THE UPPER RIDGE EDGES CLOSER TO US...BUT WE STILL KEEP A 
NORTH TO NORTHWESTERLY UPPER FLOW.  WITHIN THIS FLOW...MODELS AGREE 
ON WEAK UPPER LEVEL WAVE PASSING THROUGH THE AREA THAT WILL OFFER AT 
LEAST SOME WEAK ORGANIZED LIFT.

LOTS OF SHALLOW CUMULUS BUILD-UP THIS AFTERNOON.  THE LIFT TOMORROW 
SHOULD AT LEAST BUILD DEEPER CUMULUS AND MAY GENERATE SOME 
SHOWERS/WEAK STORMS.  ALSO BY TOMORROW THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL BE 
EAST OF US...ALLOWING FOR HIGHER DEW POINTS WEST AND SW OF US TO 
MOVE INTO THE AREA.  BEST CHANCES LOOK TO BE ON THE ELEVATED TERRAIN 
OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.  WITH THE NW-N FLOW THE CONVECTION SHOULD 
BE SLOW TO COME OUT ONTO THE VALLEY...SO HIGHEST POPS WILL BE ON THE 
PLATEAU.  ALSO HAVE ELEVATED POPS IN THE APPALACHIANS TOMORROW. FOR 
TEMPS...WENT PRETTY MUCH BETWEEN TWO MOS GUIDANCE VALUES FOR 
TONIGHT'S MIN AND SUNDAY'S MAX.

WILL MENTION PATCHY FOG EARLY TOMORROW MORNING.  VALLEY LOCATIONS 
AGAIN SHOULD BE ABLE TO FORM FOG PRETTY WELL WITH INCREASING 
MOISTURE AND LIGHT WINDS.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...RESULTING IN A MOSTLY WARM FORECAST FOR THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD AS DAYTIME HIGHS WILL PEAK IN THE MID 80S TO AROUND 
90 DEGREES EACH DAY IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. HOWEVER...SOME GULF 
MOISTURE WILL FEED UP UNDERNEATH THE RIDGE MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND 
ALLOW FOR SOME LOW CHANCES FOR ISOLATED TO PERHAPS SCATTERED  
DIURNAL CONVECTION AS SOME GULF MOISTURE GRADUALLY BEGINS TO WORK 
ITS WAY BACK UP INTO THE AREA. BY WEDNESDAY...AN UPPER-TROUGH MOVING 
THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES LOOKS AS IF IT WILL DROP A COLD FRONT INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY AS THE RIDGE BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST OF THE AREA. AHEAD 
OF THIS FRONT...MODELS ARE HINTING AT THE POTENTIAL FOR A PREFRONTAL 
TROUGH/WAVE TO MOVE INTO THE AREA...AND TRIGGER OFF SOME MORE 
WIDESPREAD SCATTERED CONVECTION FOR WEDNESDAY AND PERHAPS WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. THE COLD FRONT WILL THEN MOVE SOUTH INTO THE REGION ON 
THURSDAY...GIVING THE AREA THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION IN OVER 
A WEEK. THUS...HAVE INCREASED POPS DURING THIS TIME TO SOLID CHANCE. 
MODELS DIFFER ON HOW QUICKLY THE FRONT WILL EXIT THE AREA...SO HAVE 
CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AS WELL BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF BY 
FRIDAY MORNING AS THE FRONT EXITS THE AREA..SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR 
WILL BE WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE REGION IN WAKE OF THE FRONTAL 
PASSAGE...DROPPING LOWS BACK INTO THE MID 50S TO UPPER 60S AND HIGHS 
IN THE UPPER 70S TO MID 80S FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

FOG LOOKS LIKE IT WILL DEVELOP ONCE AGAIN OVERNIGHT...MAINLY ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TN...SW VA...AND SW NC WHERE TEMPERATURES WILL BE
SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN OTHER AREAS THUS ALLOWING FOR A SMALLER

AFTERNOON CONTINUE TO FALL INTO THE 40S...BEHIND THE WEAK FRONT 
HEADED OUR WAY EARLY TONIGHT. THIS WIND SHIFT AND DRIER AIR SHOULD 
INHIBIT DENSE FOG FROM DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT AT TRI. HOWEVER...I KEPT 
A FEW HOURS OF MVFR FOR PATCHY FOG IN THE 08Z TO 12Z PERIOD AT TRI.

250 PM EDT THU SEP 5 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...QUIET WEATHER REMAINS THROUGH 
THE SHORT TERM. A LONG WAVE TROUGH TO OUR NORTHEAST AND A RIDGE TO 
OUR WEST...WILL KEEP A PREDOMINATELY NORTHWEST FLOW ACROSS THE AREA. 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CURRENTLY OVER THE GREAT LAKES...WILL CONTINUE 
TO DROP SOUTH AND BUILD ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH TOMORROW. NORTHWEST 
FLOW COMBINED WITH BUILDING SURFACE HIGH WILL KEEP US DRY THROUGH THE 
SHORT TERM. HOWEVER...MODELS SHOW A WEAK COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE TROUGH TO OUR NORTHEAST CONTINUING TO DRIFT SOUTH INTO SW VA 
BY THIS EVENING AND REACHING THE SOUTHERN VALLEY BY TOMORROW
MORNING. THE FRONT APPEARS RATHER WEAK AND SHOULDN'T IMPACT OUR
WEATHER OTHER THAN MAYBE A FEW CLOUDS ALONG THE FRONT. WILL INCLUDE
PATCHY FOG IN ZONES FOR NE TN AND SW VA AREAS...AS SLIGHTLY COOLER
AIR BEHIND THE FRONT WILL NARROW THE DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS ACROSS
THE AFOREMENTIONED AREAS AND LEAD TO POTENTIAL FOG DEVELOPMENT LATE
TONIGHT AND EARLY TOMORROW MORNING. STAYED WITH MOS MAX/MIN TEMP
BLEND FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER ACROSS THE REGION THIS
WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...RESULTING IN A MOSTLY DRY AND WARM
FORECAST FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS DAYTIME HIGHS WILL PEAK IN THE
MID 80S TO AROUND 90 DEGREES EACH DAY IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. BY
SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...SOME GULF MOISTURE WILL FEED UP UNDERNEATH THE
RIDGE AND ALLOW FOR SOME LOW CHANCES FOR ISOLATED DIURNAL
CONVECTION...BUT MOST OF THE AREA SHOULD REMAIN DRY HEADING INTO
THE MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER...BY WEDNESDAY AN UPPER-
TROUGH MOVING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES LOOKS AS IF IT WILL DROP A
COLD FRONT INTO THE AREA...GIVING THE REGION THE BEST CHANCE FOR
PRECIPITATION IN OVER A WEEK. ACCORDINGLY...HAVE BUMPED POPS UP TO
SOLID CHANCE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE THE FRONT IS
PROGGED TO CLEAR THE AREA BY THURSDAY.

WEATHER DAYS IN STORE TODAY WITH A NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BRINGING A 
FEW CIRRUS CLOUDS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BUT THE LOW

DOMINANT FEATURE THROUGH THE PERIOD AS IT SHIFTS FROM THE PLAINS TO

OVER THE AREA THROUGH TOMORROW. DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL PREVAIL
THROUGH THE EVENING...WEAKENING OVERNIGHT. THE TEMPERATURE DROP
TONIGHT...ALONG WITH THE WARM WATERS...WILL CREATE PATCHY FOG AGAIN
FOR EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. LOCALLY DENSE FOG COULD BE
POSSIBLE...MAINLY NORTH OF KNOXVILLE. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR
NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...VERY QUIET
PATTERN OVERALL. THIS PERIOD STARTS WITH THE UPPER HIGH CENTERED
OVER COLORADO AND ITS ASSOCIATE RIDGE TO THE SOUTHEAST INTO THE
BAHAMAS...AND AN UPPER TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA. THIS PUTS OUR
AREA AT THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE THURSDAY EVENING. THIS
PATTERN HOLDS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...THEN FINALLY BY MONDAY...THE
UPPER HIGH FROM COLORADO WEAKENS...BUT MOVES MORE DIRECTLY OVER OUR
REGION. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE STARTS TO INCREASE OVER THE
WEEKEND...AND BY SUNDAY WE START POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND CONTINUE
THIS TREND THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. HOWEVER...WILL
KEEP VALLEY LOCATIONS DRY THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST. FOR
TEMPERATURES...WENT A LITTLE BELOW GUIDANCE FOR MAX TEMPS ON MOST
DAYS. FOR MIN TEMPS WENT A LITTLE ABOVE GUIDANCE AT THE END OF THE
FORECAST WHEN AN APPROACHING FRONT SHOULD INDUCE HIGHER DEWPOINTS
AND A LITTLE MORE BREEZE.

STILL BE A FEW CLOUDS BANKED UP AGAINST THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE 
NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AND ACROSS CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES IN NORTH

LIKELY START OUT WITH SOME FOG IN THE VALLEYS BUT SHOULD DISSIPATE 
NICELY BY 10 AM EDT. MAX TEMP GUIDANCE LOOKS A BIT TOO WARM TODAY SO 
BACKED OFF A DEGREE OR TWO TODAY WHILE STAYING CLOSE TO THE MIDDLE 
GROUND OF SUGGESTED MINS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A STRONG HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
WILL BE SLOWLY DRIFTING FROM THE MS VALLEY REGION TO THE MID 
ATLANTIC COAST THROUGH THE PERIOD. THIS WILL KEEP DRY WEATHER AND 
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES OVER THE TN VALLEY EACH DAY. THE GFS MOS 
HIGH TEMPERATURES APPEAR TOO WARM...AND ARE ON THE HIGH END OF THE

SLIGHT CHANCE POPS BACK INTO THE GRIDS WITH A LATE AFTERNOON PERIOD
ADDED TO ZFP PRODUCT. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...EXTENDED

RIDGE. LIMITED THESE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO ERN MTNS AND SW NC...
ADJACENT TO GSP AND FFC GRIDS. 

NW FLOW ALOFT FOR THE WEEKEND AS THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS STAYS OVER THE 
PLAINS STATES. CAN'T RULE OUT SPOTTY DIURNAL CONVECTION FOR BOTH SAT

REFLECTED THIS SO LITTLE CHANGES MADE. 

BY MONDAY AND TUESDAY...MODELS IN GENERAL CONSENSUS IN BUILDING THE 
UPPER RIDGE EASTWARD...WHILE THE SURFACE RIDGE HAS MOVED ENOUGH EAST 
TO ALLOW SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW TO DEVELOP. THIS INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE AND DAYTIME HEATING SUPPORT 20 TO 30 PERCENT CHANCE POPS

CEILINGS FORMING IN SAT IMAGERY THIS MORNING WOULD LEAVE ON TO
BELIEVE THAT A CEILING AROUND 3500-4000 FT WILL BE AROUND THROUGH

STAYED MVFR FOR NOW BUT THIS COULD BE IFR DEPENDING ON THE

.DISCUSSION...
A COLD FRONT IS PROGRESSING SOUTHEAST FROM SOUTHERN KENTUCKY AND
MIDDLE TENNESSEE THIS EVENING TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. ALONG THIS
BOUNDARY...SOME CLUSTERS OF THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO FIRE AND
SLOWLY MOVE OFF TO THE EAST TOWARD THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND
EVENTUALLY EAST TENNESSEE HEADING INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. WITH THE
LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BE WEAKER BUT SOME
ELEVATED INSTABILITY SHOULD STILL KEEP SOME SCATTERED STORMS GOING
THOUGH THE NIGHT. THE MAIN IMPACTS WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS WILL
BE LIGHTNING AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. OTHERWISE...PARTLY CLOUDY
AND SLIGHTLY COOLER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED WITH LOWS IN THE MID
60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...A COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED TO
MOVE THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND INTO EARLY TUESDAY MORNING.
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE CURRENTLY DEVELOPING AHEAD OF THIS
FRONT. THIS CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING AND INTO
THE NIGHT. CAPE VALUES ARE AROUND 2500 J/KG WITH LI VALUES UP TO
-5. WIND SHEAR IS WEAK BUT STRONG WINDS ALOFT. A FEW OF THESE
STORMS COULD BECOME SEVERE. WIND LOOKS TO BE THE MAIN THREAT AT
THIS TIME...AS WELL AS MODERATE SIZE HAIL AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING.
THERE IS A DECENT MIDLEVEL DRY AIR LAYER IN EACH SOUNDING.
DEPENDING ON WHEN THE DRY AIR DOES PROGRESS INTO THE AREA...COULD
SEE DENSE FOG IN THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. COOLER TEMPERATURES AND
CLEARING SKIES WILL BE PRESENT BEHIND THIS FRONT THROUGH THE DAY ON
TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...COLD FRONT
PROGGED THRU THE AREA BY TUESDAY EVENING WILL USHER IN DRY
WEATHER...MOST LIKELY WELL INTO FRIDAY. WEAK ESE LOW LEVEL FLOW MAY
SET UP AROUND THE SURFACE AND 850 MB RIDGE BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...SO
I KEPT THE PREVIOUS SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FOR MAINLY THE EASTERN
MTNS FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

KEPT LOW POPS IN FOR POSSIBLE DIURNAL CONVECTION SATURDAY...BUT MOS 
POPS ARE TRENDING DOWNWARD. THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS ACTUALLY BUILDS 
EASTWARD ACROSS THE REGION BY SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...WHICH TAKES THE 
FORECAST AREA OUT OF THE NW FLOW ALOFT...AND MAY PROLONG THE DRY 
WEATHER. HOWEVER...I SAW NO REASON NOT TO CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
ALL AREAS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...ABOUT 10 PERCENT BELOW GFSX MOS 
POPS. INTRODUCING NEW DAY 7 (MONDAY) WITH JUST TOKEN 15 PERCENT POPS 
FOR SW VA/NE TN AND ERN MTNS AT THIS POINT...AND DRY MONDAY NIGHT.

FOR TEMPS...12Z GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE CONSISTENT WITH 00Z MODEL RUN...
WITH LATEST ECMX MOS TEMPS JUST A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER ON HIGHS EACH 
DAY. ALL MOS MINS VERY CLOSE...SO JUST VERY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS MADE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN WITH EMBEDDED DISTURBANCES WILL CONTINUE 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH A COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE AREA ON 
TUESDAY. A 500 MB VORT MAX IS PRODUCING SOME SHOWERS OVER SOUTHERN 
MIDDLE TN AND NRN AL THIS MORNING...AND THE NAM BRINGS SOME SHOWERS 
INTO OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES LATER THIS MORNING...WHICH APPEARS 
REASONABLE. SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED SHOWERS MAY BE POSSIBLE 
THROUGH THE DAY...BUT PRECIP CHANCES APPEAR TO INCREASE IN THE 
EVENING WITH THE PASSAGE OF A MID-UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS. THE NAM 
SOUNDINGS SHOW PLENTIFUL CAPE AND SOME STEEP 850-700 LAPSE 
RATES...SO THERE WILL BE SOME ISOLATED SEVERE POTENTIAL. SURFACE TO 
MIDLEVEL THETA-E DIFFERENCES ARE 20-30 DEGREES C...SO WIND GUSTS 
WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE AS 
MOISTURE DEPTH IS LIMITED IN THE NW FLOW.

THE SURFACE COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA TUESDAY MORNING. WILL 
KEEP SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE MORNING WITH WEAK FORCING WITH 
THE FRONT...BUT RAPID DRYING ALOFT AND MIDLEVEL STABILIZATION WILL 
END PRECIP CHANCES BY THE AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO
THE FORECAST AREA BRINGING DRIER AIR AND SLIGHTLY COOLER
TEMPERATURES. A DRY FORECAST REMAINS IN PLACE THROUGH MUCH OF THE
WORK WEEK. CONFIDENCE LESSENS WHEN IT COMES TO RAIN CHANCES FOR
LATE WEEK AND INTO THE WEEKEND. AS SUCH HAVE CONTINUED WITH ONLY
SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE MENTIONED FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO THE

FORECAST AREA IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. HOWEVER...ADDITIONAL 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE POSSIBLE LATER THIS AFTERNOON INTO

SHORT WAVES MOVE THROUGH THE LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL PUSH THE 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT...WITH A

BUILDS INTO THE REGION ON TUESDAY...WITH DRIER AND COOLER CONDITIONS

IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MINS TONIGHT AND MONDAY NIGHT...AND LOOK 
REASONABLE. DISCREPANCIES ARE SEEN WITH MAXES FOR BOTH MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY...MOSTLY DUE TO THEIR DIFFERENCES IN CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
MID LEVEL DISTURBANCES IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL CONTINUE TO 
BRING PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO THE AREA TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. THE MODELS HAVE NOT BEEN DOING WELL WITH THIS PATTERN. 
CONFIDENCE IN THE FINER MODEL DETAILS AND TIMING OF CONVECTION IS 
LOW...SO WILL BROAD BRUSH POPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. THIS 
MORNING...RADAR TRENDS SHOW DECREASING INTENSITY TO THE REMNANTS OF 
AN MCS...WHICH WILL MAINLY AFFECT THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. ADDITIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR THIS AFTERNOON WITH SOME 
DESTABILIZATION...AND WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS EVERYWHERE. WILL KEEP 
HIGH CHANCE POPS GOING OVERNIGHT. AFTER MORNING CONVECTION 
DISSIPATES...THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH SUNSHINE TO BRING TEMPS INTO THE 
MID AND UPPER 80S THIS AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM (LABOR DAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
WARM AND HUMID AIRMASS WILL REMAIN WILL ACROSS THE FORECAST BEFORE
A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. SHORT RANGE
MODELS DIFFER ON TEMPS AND POPS...PREFERRED THE GFS AND ITS
HANDLING OF THE FROPA WHEREAS NAM SHOWED THE FRONT WASHING
OUT/STALL IN NW FLOW. CLOUDS MAY NOT INHIBIT DAYTIME TEMPS WARMING
UP INTO THE 80S. SOME LINGERING SHOWER CHANCES WILL PERSIST INTO
MONDAY NIGHT AND THROUGH AT LEAST MID-DAY TUESDAY BEFORE DRYING
OUT. 

ANOTHER TREND IN THE MODELS HAS BEEN WARMER DAYTIME TEMPS
INCLUDING THE ECMWF. THEREFORE TWEAKED THOSE TEMPS THROUGH THE REST
OF THE WEEK. OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURE FORECAST LOOKED REASONABLE AND
MADE ONLY MINOR CHANGES.

THE MAJORITY OF THE WEEK WILL BE DRY. BY FRIDAY THERE IS A HINT OF
A DECENT SHORTWAVE DIVING INTO THE MID-MS VALLEY WHICH COULD BRING
CHANCES FOR ADDITIONAL RAINFALL BY SATURDAY.

A LINE OF STRONG THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUES TO TRACK ACROSS THE
NORTHERN TIER OF COUNTIES AND TOWARD KNOXVILLE AND THE
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEY. WITH SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY STILL IN
PLACE...THESE STORMS WILL CONTINUE THIS EVENING AND INTO THE
OVERNIGHT HOURS AS ANOTHER CLUSTER OF SHOWERS/STORMS MAY MOVE INTO
THE REGION IN WAKE OF THIS INITIAL LINE. HOWEVER...THE OVERALL TREND
WILL BE WEAKER AS THE NIGHT PROGRESSES AS SOME STABILIZATION WILL
OCCUR. THE MAIN IMPACTS WITH THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE LIGHTNING AND
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL...BUT GIVEN ITS LINEAR NATURE SOME GUSTY
OUTFLOW WINDS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE WITH THESE STORMS AS WELL.
GIVEN THE SHOWER/STORM ACTIVITY...THINK THAT FOG DEVELOPMENT MAY BE
A LITTLE LESS WIDESPREAD TONIGHT SO HAVE KEPT A MENTION OF THIS OUT
OF THE ZONES. HOWEVER...SOME LOCALIZED POCKETS WILL CERTAINLY BE
POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT IN SHELTERED/PRECIP FREE LOCATIONS.

THE FORECAST AREA...BUT ESPECIALLY OVER SOUTHWEST VA. THIS 
CONVECTION WAS OCCURRING AHEAD OF AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE...WHICH 
WAS MOVING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION IN 
THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION IS 
EXPECTED ON SUNDAY...AS THE AIR MASS BECOMES MODERATELY UNSTABLE IN 
THE AFTERNOON AND A LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL EVENTUALLY 
PUSH THE COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON LABOR DAY...WITH A 
GOOD COVERAGE OF CONVECTION EXPECTED AGAIN. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT... MAINLY DUE TO THE DIFFERENCES IN CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP 
COVERAGE. FOR NOW...WILL TREND CLOSE TO A PERSISTENCE FORECAST 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LINGERING SHOWERS MAY BE 
POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TUESDAY MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE 
MOVES INTO THE REGION. CLEAR SKIES AND DRY WEATHER WILL REMAIN 
THROUGH THE REST OF THE WORK WEEK. DUE TO UPSLOPE FLOW FROM THE 
NORTHWEST WINDS...THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE MOUNTAINS FRIDAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN 
CANADA AND AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL SWING DOWN OVER SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE...INCREASING CLOUDS BEGINNING 
FRIDAY EVENING. THIS FRONT WILL BRING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
DEVELOPING SATURDAY EVENING. MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT RAIN 
CHANCES WITH THIS FRONT. SEVERE WEATHER IS NOT EXPECTED AT THIS 
TIME...BUT THE CONVECTION IS STILL TOO FAR OUT IN TIME TO TELL WITH 
HIGH CONFIDENCE. TEMPERATURES WILL COOL TUESDAY AS THE HIGH PRESSURE

REMNANTS OF A MCS NOW NEAR THE OHIO RIVER WILL BE APPROACHING THE 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THIS MORNING. BY AFTERNOON SHOWERS

SHOWS GOOD INSTABILITY IN SOUTHERN AREAS...WITH THE GFS SHOWING
LESS INSTABILITY. A FEW STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE STORMS MAY BE
POSSIBLE SOUTH. MOISTURE IS STILL LIMITED IN THE DEEP NW FLOW...SO
WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE. WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE MCV AND
STABILIZATION AFTER SUNSET...WILL LOWER POPS BACK TO A SLIGHT
CHANCE AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A BROAD TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN U.S. ALONG WITH A COLD FRONT
MOVING ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY WILL PLACE THE FORECAST
AREA UNDER FAVORABLE CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH
EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE ATMOSPHERE BECOMES INCREASINGLY UNSTABLE
SUNDAY AFTERNOON BUT UPPER FLOW REMAINS WEAK. STRONGER STORMS ARE

MONDAY AFTERNOON. FORECAST MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE CAPES OF
2500-3500 J/KG AND LI/S AROUND -8 DEG C. THESE UPDRAFTS...ONCE
DEVELOPED COULD PRODUCE LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS. WILL
CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT THIS THREAT IN THE HAZ WX OUTLOOK. DUE TO
MODELS SLOWING THE FROPA THROUGH...HAVE HELD ON TO SLIGHTLY HIGHER
POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY BEFORE THE SURFACE HIGH BUILDS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS CENTERED OVER THE PLAINS 
TODAY WILL SLOWLY RETROGRADE THROUGH TONIGHT. TODAY WILL CONTINUE TO 
FEATURE A DRY NW FLOW ALOFT...AND A MIDLEVEL STABLE LAYER THAT WILL 
FURTHER SUPPRESS CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW 
A WEAKER STABLE LAYER AROUND 700 MB AT CHA THAN AT TRI...SO WILL 
HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP SOUTH AND IN HIGHER TERRAIN. THE NAM 
DEVELOPS PRECIP OVER THE AREA TONIGHT AHEAD OF A MIDLEVEL TROUGH. 
THE GFS IS DRIER AND SHOWS MUCH LESS TROUGHING TONIGHT. WILL SIDE 
WITH THE GFS AND GO WITH A DRIER FORECAST TONIGHT. TEMPS ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S TO 
LOWER 90S AND LOWS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
THE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL WEAKEN OVER THE
FORECAST AREA BY EARLY SATURDAY. A SHORTWAVE IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW
WILL BISECT THE REGION BY THE AFTERNOON. THERE WILL BE INCREASING
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT THE DAY STARTING FIRST OVER
THE NORTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES. FOR TEMPERATURES COMPROMISED BETWEEN
NAM/GFS. NAM WAS REALLY WET WHICH HAD A COOLING EFFECT AND THE GFS
WAS WARMER AND DRIER. EXPECT ANY THUNDERSTORMS THAT FORMED SATURDAY
AFTERNOON TO DISSIPATE BY 9PM. FEEL THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT MAY
REMAIN DRY HOWEVER KEPT IN LOW CHANCE POPS. THE TROUGH REMAINS
NEARLY STATIONARY WITH ANOTHER SHORTWAVE FILLING IN FOR SUNDAY.
COMBINE THE SHORTWAVE WITH THE EXPECTED INSTABILITY AND WE WILL
LIKELY SEE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OCCUR BY AFTERNOON. LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINFALL UP TO AN INCH AND A QUARTER COULD OCCUR OVER THE
SOUTHERN PLATEAU/VALLEY.

A WELL DEFINED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE AREA ON MONDAY. 
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED. SOME OF THESE 
STORMS MAY BE SEVERE ACROSS PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE BULK OF 
THE UPPER DYNAMICS WILL BE ACROSS W VA...HOWEVER PROGGED LIFTED 
INDICES ARE -8 DEG C AND CAPE VALUES FROM 2500-3500 J/KG. BY MONDAY 
NIGHT HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD IN HOWEVER SOME RAINFALL 
COULD STILL OCCUR IN THE UPSLOPE AREA IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. THIS 
MAY PERSIST INTO TUESDAY. OTHERWISE OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
NOTICEABLY COOLER/DRIER AND DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WILL BE PLEASANT. 
DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THE REST OF NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED COLD FRONT OVER KENTUCKY 
AND SOUTHWEST VA...GENERALLY STRETCHING FROM NEAR LOUISVILLE KY TO 
WISE VA. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE SOUTHWARD INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...BUT IT WILL LIKELY STALL OUT OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY BY FRIDAY AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES WEAKER AND 
MORE WESTERLY. A MARGINALLY TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS 
PROGGED TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY...BUT MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE A FAIRLY STRONG STABLE LAYER IN MID LEVELS 
(BETWEEN 750 AND 550 MB) WHICH SHOULD CAP THE LOCAL AIR MASS ENOUGH 
TO LIMIT ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT TO JUST ISOLATED COVERAGE 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. BY SATURDAY...THIS MID-LEVEL CAPPING STABLE 
LAYER SHOULD ERODE AS A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE CENTRAL 
PART OF THE NATION WEAKENS AND AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEGINS TO 
AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL 
HELP TO CREATE A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ON SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT AND LOOK REASONABLE. TEMPS 
ARE NOT EXPECTED TO FALL MUCH BEHIND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY...WITH THE 
TEMP FORECAST ESSENTIALLY BEING A PERSISTENCE FORECAST OF ABOVE 
NORMAL VALUES.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UNSETTLED WEATHER WILL 
DOMINATE THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED.  A WEAKENING FRONT 
WILL BE EXITING THE REGION ON SUNDAY WITH ASSOCIATE CONVECTION 
LINGERING INTO SUNDAY NIGHT.  THE MAIN SYSTEM FOR THE EXTENDED WILL 
BE A RATHER STRONG COLD FRONT THAT WILL SLIDE IN AROUND THE MONDAY 
TIME FRAME.  WILL CONTINUE LIKELY POPS IN THE FORECAST FOR THIS.  A 
FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER THROUGH LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY 
TUESDAY.  THEN...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW 
WILL TAKE OVER FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD PROVIDING DRY CONDITIONS.

EARLY THIS MORNING...A WEAK COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO GRADUALLY MOVE
SOUTHWARD THROUGH EASTERN KY AND SOUTHWEST VA. HOWEVER...ANY LIGHT
SHOWER ACTIVITY IS BASICALLY NON-EXISTENT ATTM AS MOST OF THIS
ACTIVITY HAS WEAKENED AND DISSIPATED OVER THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT.
THIS FRONT WILL GRADUALLY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...BUT
SHOULD NOT BRING MUCH IN THE WAY OF COOLER AIR AS HIGHS WILL REACH
THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S ONCE AGAIN. IN ADDITION...SOME ISOLATED TO
PERHAPS SCATTERED SHOWERS AND STORMS MAY DEVELOP ALONG THE FRONT
LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HOWEVER...AS WAS THE CASE
YESTERDAY MOST LOCATIONS WILL REMAIN DRY. THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE IN
PLACE WILL PROMOTE SOME CLEARING CONDITIONS LATER TONIGHT ALONG
WITH CALM WINDS AND MILD LOWS ONCE AGAIN.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
GFS MODEL CONTINUES TO BE GENERALLY CONSISTENT FROM RUN TO
RUN...ALTHO FURTHER OUT IN TIME THE ECMWF IS FAVORED. THIS LENDS
MUCH SUPPORT TO TIMING A MORE SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE
TOWARD MONDAY NIGHT...WITH LIKELY POPS A GOOD BET FOR DAYTIME
MONDAY. KEPT POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WITH
SCATTERED WORDING ADDED FOR SUNDAY. OTHERWISE...DROPPED POPS A BIT
SOONER OVER NRN AREAS ON TUESDAY WITH NO CHANGES MADE FOR TUESDAY
NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

FOR THE EARLIEST PERIODS OF THE EXTENDED...BACKDOOR COLD FRONT 
PUSHES THROUGH ON FRIDAY...BUT TIME HEIGHTS AND SOUNDINGS STILL SHOW 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. THUS...KEPT TOKEN 20 TO 30 PERCENT POPS IN

BUILDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA. MODEL FORECASTS INDICATE THE FRONT

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

302 AM EDT WED AUG 28 2013

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO THE WEST OF THE REGION
CONTINUES TO PROMOTE MILD AND DRY CONDITIONS EARLY THIS MORNING.
ALONG THE NORTHEASTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS LARGE RIDGE...A COMPLEX OF
STORMS IS STILL MOVING ACROSS OHIO AND INTO NORTHERN WEST
VIRGINIA. THIS COMPLEX MAY EVENTUALLY BUILD BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST
LATER TODAY INTO CENTRAL/SOUTHERN WEST VIRGINIA AND EASTERN
KENTUCKY LATER TODAY AND PERHAPS ALLOW FOR SOME SCATTERED
CONVECTION TO CLIP SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE
LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. HOWEVER...STILL THINK THAT MOST
OF THE AREA WILL REMAIN DRY AS MODELS/TRENDS ARE INDICATING MOST OF
THIS ACTIVITY WILL BE CONCENTRATED WELL NORTHEAST OF THE AREA.
STILL...GIVEN SOME MODERATE INSTABILITY VALUES...LOCALLY STRONG TO
BRIEFLY SEVERE STORMS COULD BE POSSIBLE WITH DAMAGING WINDS AND
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL BEING THE PRIMARY CONCERNS. OTHERWISE...
PARTLY SUNNY AND WARM CONDITIONS IN THE MID 80S TO LOW 90S ARE
EXPECTED BY THE AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
UPPER RIDGE STILL THE DOMINANT FEATURE THROUGH FRIDAY...AND SHOULD
KEEP ANY LATE NIGHT CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES N AND NE OF THE FORECAST
AREA. DIURNAL CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE FOR THURSDAY WITH ONLY LOW
POPS JUSTIFIED. KEPT THURSDAY NIGHT DRY FOR NOW IN LINE WITH SHORT
RANGE MODELS AND MOS POPS...THEN MAINLY LOW POPS FOR ERN MOST AREAS
FRIDAY WITH A BIT OF DRYING ELSEWHERE BEHIND WEAK BACKDOOR COLD
FRONT.

BY THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...THE UPPER RIDGE RETROGRESSES 
WESTWARD WITH A GRADUAL SHIFT TO TROUGHINESS OVER GREAT LAKES AND 
OHIO VALLEY. THIS ALLOWS FOR AN INCREASE IN RAIN CHANCES AND SETS UP 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR SOME LATE NIGHT CONVECTION AS WELL. BEST 
CHANCES ARE INDICATED FOR SUNDAY INTO LABOR DAY AS IN PREVIOUS 
GRIDS. STAYED BELOW LIKELY POPS FOR NOW FOR THOSE PERIODS...ALTHO 
THE 28/00Z GFSX MOS POPS ARE TRENDING SLIGHTLY UPWARD FROM 27/12Z 
RUN. TUESDAY MAY SHAPE UP AS A DRY DAY...DEPENDING ON TIMING OF A 
STRONGER COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE. HUNG ON TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW 
ON TUESDAY FOR CONTINUITY. 

FOR TEMPS...GFS MOS HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN ABOUT 1 TO 3 DEGREES TOO 
WARM ON MAX TEMPS OF LATE. THE 28/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS DID REFLECT 
SLIGHTLY COOLER HIGHS FROM SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...WHICH SEEMS 
REASONABLE GIVEN THE PATTERN CHANGES THAT OCCUR. ADJUSTED MAX AND 
MIN TEMPS GENERALLY IN LINE WITH LATEST GUIDANCE...TAKING SEVERAL 
DEGREES OFF OF TUESDAY NIGHT MIN TEMPS AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE.

311 PM EDT TUE AUG 27 2013

.SHORT TERM...STORM MONITOR AND SPC ANALYSIS SHOWS INCREASING
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE CENTRAL
APPALACHAINS. FLOW ALOFT WILL REMAIN NORTHWEST OVER THE EASTERN
THIRD OF THE NATION ALLOWING SHORT-WAVE ENERGY TO MOVE ACROS THE
OHIO VALLEY INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS AND MID-ATLANTIC STATES.
MOST OF THE CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THESE WAVES WILL REMAIN
NORTH AND EAST OF THE AREA. HOWEVER...AS LIKE THIS AFTERNOON A FEW
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDESTORM WILL MOVE INTO SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND POSSIBLY NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. WILL MAINTAIN LOW CHANCE
POPS THERE.

OTHERWISE...RIDGING INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL LIMIT CONVECTION
DUE TO THE MID-LEVEL INVERSION. A GOOD DEAL OF CONVECTIVE DEBRIS
WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS MOST OF THE EAST TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

PATCHY FOG WILL ONCE AGAIN BE POSSIBLE EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. AS
FOR TEMPERATURES...GENERALLY FOLLOWED NAM HIGHS AND COMPROMISE OF
GFS/NAM MINS DUE TO PAST PERFORMANCE

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO 
BE IN DECENT AGREEMENT OVERALL AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IS NOT 
BAD. FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF 
YEAR...WITH BIGGEST AREA OF UNCERTAINTY BEING MODEL HANDLING OF ANY 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES COMING DOWN THE EAST SIDE OF THE RIDGE.  THE 
LARGE UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN TO OUR WEST...AND WILL RETROGRADE EVEN 
FURTHER WEST LATE IN THE PERIOD.  FIRST CONCERN WILL BE ANY 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES THAT MAY COME DOWN THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE 
RIDGE.  LOOKS LIKE HIGHEST POPS SHOULD BE NORTH IN THIS 
SCENARIO...AND WILL KEEP POPS ON THE LOWER SIDE GIVEN UNCERTAINTY.  
BY LATE IN THE PERIOD UPPER TROUGH WILL DEEPEN ACROSS THE EASTERN 
US.  A COLD FRONT IS FORECAST TO SWING THROUGH MONDAY OR MONDAY 
NIGHT.  WILL CARRY HIGHEST POPS ON MONDAY.  WILL GENERALLY TRIM A 
FEW DEGREES FROM GFS MOS MAX TEMPS...WITH ONLY A FEW TWEAKS TO 
MINS.

DEVELOPING ONCE AGAIN THIS MORNING...ESPECIALLY IN THE FAVORED
VALLEY LOCATIONS SUCH AS TRI-CITIES AIRPORT...ABINGDON AND MURPHY
NC. A BAND OF THICKER HIGH CLOUDS MAY DRIFT ACROSS AND IMPROVE
VISBYS BRIEFLY BEFORE DAYBREAK. CARRIED A MENTION OF FOG JUST
BEYOND 12Z TODAY...AND ALSO ADDED VALLEY/AREA LAKES FOG FOR LATE
TONIGHT AS WELL.

BULK OF OUR FORECAST AREA IS NOW INCLUDED IN THE DAY ONE CONVECTIVE
OUTLOOK FOR GENERAL TSRA...WITH NAM MODEL THE MOST ZEALOUS IN
CREATING BOTH DIURNAL CONVECTION...AS WELL AS TRACKING SOME LATE
NIGHT MCS ACTIVITY ACROSS NRN 1/2 OF THE FORECAST AREA. NO OTHER
MODEL OR SREF DEPICTS THE MCS TRACK THIS FAR SOUTH FOR TONIGHT...SO
I JUST ADDED LOW POPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS SW VA
AND PARTS OF NE TN FOR NOW. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW AN INCREASE IN
MOISTURE TODAY...BUT CHA SOUNDING SHOWS A DECENT CAPPING INVERSION
AROUND 650 TO 700 MB LEVEL TO INHIBIT TSRA. NOTED DRY AIR BELOW
CLOUD BASES AND ALSO IN THE MID LEVELS...SO I MAY MENTION ISOLATED
STRONG STORMS WITH WIND GUSTS UP TO 45 MPH IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER
PRODUCT. 

OTHERWISE...I HEDGED A BIT CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM MOS OR A BLEND
OF MOS FOR HIGHS TODAY. GFS MINS LOOKED QUITE REASONABLE AND WERE
CLOSELY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH LABOR DAY/...
A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OVER THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
VALLEY WILL REMAIN THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK. ALONG THE NORTHERN 
PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE...A COMPLEX OF STORMS WILL ROLL FROM THE 
GREAT LAKES INTO WEST VIRGINIA AND CLIP THE FAR NORTHEAST ZONES ON 
WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...THINK THAT ONLY LOW TO PERHAPS MODERATE CHANCE 
POPS ARE WARRANTED ATTM GIVEN THE SCATTERED NATURE OF THIS ACTIVITY. 
ADDITIONAL SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW END CHANCE POPS WILL CONTINUE 
THURSDAY INTO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND AS ISOLATED TO SCATTERED DIURNAL 
CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE EACH DAY GIVEN THE MOISTURE UNDERNEATH 
THIS RIDGE. PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE SUNDAY INTO 
LABOR DAY AS THE RIDGE RETROGRADES TO THE WEST AND A BROAD 
UPPER-TROUGH SWINGS INTO THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY. WARM

SEVERAL SPOTS LIKELY RUNNING VISBYS BETWEEN ZERO AND 1/2 MILE.
NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH FOR A DENSE FOG ADVISORY...BUT I DID CARRY

JUSTIFIED.  

OTHERWISE...DRY TONIGHT AND RELATIVELY CLEAR SKIES. KEPT ANY FOG OUT 
FOR NOW DUE TO DRIER AIR MOVING IN. STUCK CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR HIGHS 
TODAY...AND ALSO FOR MINS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...BUILDING UPPER RIDGE OVER
THE REGION AND DRIER AIR MASS WILL KEEP FORECAST AREA DRY SUNDAY

TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S SUNDAY NIGHT AND HIGHS
MID TO UPPER 80S SUNDAY AND MONDAY. 

TUESDAY AS RIDGE RETROGRADES TO THE WEST SHORTWAVES WILL BEGIN TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS CURRENTLY DEVELOPING ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH
THE EVENING AS A WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA.
MODELS SHOW PRECIP CONTINUING INTO THE EARLY NIGHT...BUT WITH THE
AMOUNT OF MIDLEVEL DRY AIR MOVING INTO THE REGION BEHIND THIS
FRONT...CONVECTION IS GOING TO BE VERY LIMITED. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
IS STILL PRESENT... SO CAN EXPECT FOG DEVELOPMENT IN THE EARLY
MORNING HOURS. HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLOWLY PROGRESS WESTWARD OVER OUR
AREA. SATURDAY LOOKS TO BE DRY WITH FEW CLOUDS IN THE SKY. KEPT
TEMPERATURES VERY CLOSE TO MOS THROUGH SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... STRONG H5 HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED ROUGHLY NEAR KANSAS CITY THROUGH THE
PERIOD. THIS WILL ALLOW HIGH TEMPS FOR OUR AREA TO CLIMB TO THE MID
80S TO LOWER 90S...THUS ABOVE NORMAL. BUT THE POSITION OF THE HIGH
THAT FAR TO OUR WEST WILL KEEP US OPEN TO DISTURBANCES IN THE NW
FLOW...MAINLY LATER IN THE PERIOD FROM NEXT WED THROUGH FRI. AS FOR
THE EARLY HALF OF THE EXTENDED...SUN THROUGH TUES...EXPECT ISOLATED
DIURNAL ACTIVITY AT BEST...MOSTLY INITIATING OVER OUR HIGHER
ELEVATIONS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONVECTION HAS STAYED WELL NORTH 
OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT...AND IN FACT YET TO ENTER EVEN 
NORTHERN MOST COUNTIES OF KY. MODELS WERE IN GENERAL ALL SHOWING
TOO MUCH PRECIPITATION FOR THE 06Z TO 12Z PERIOD THIS MORNING.
WITH NOTHING ANYWHERE CLOSE...HAD TO DECREASE POPS SOME FOR THE
MORNING HOURS THEN TREND BACK TO SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS WITH HIGHEST CHANCE POPS OVER NRN MOST AREAS. LOWERED
POPS A BIT QUICKER FROM THE NW THIS EVENING. MAX AND MIN TEMPS
CHANGED VERY LITTLE FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS.

MAIN CONCERN THIS MORNING IS PATCHY DENSE FOG THAT HAS DEVELOPED
UNDER THE RELATIVELY CLEAR SKIES.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WITH DRIER
AIR MASS BUILDS IN SATURDAY AND WITH SOME RESIDUAL MOISTURE IN THE
MOUNTAINS WILL MAINTAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY. SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLE MODELS KEEP BUILDING
RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL STATES BUT EXTENDING EAST THROUGH
THE TN VALLEY. NW FLOW INTO THE FORECAST AREA IS DRY FROM SATURDAY
EVENING THROUGH SUNDAY SO HAVE NO POPS. MONDAY AND TUESDAY HEATING AND
INSTABILITY TO DEVELOP AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY RIDGE RETREATS SLIGHTLY WEST
SO NW FLOW TO BRING MOISTURE AND A BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. FOR TEMPERATURES KEPT HIGHS SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE
FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S...THEN FOR THE
LATER EXTENDED LOWER 90S SOUTH. IF RIDGE BUILDS IN STRONGER HIGHS
MAY HAVE TO BE RAISED A FEW DEGREES HIGHER. NIGHT TIME LOWS WILL BE
A FEW DEGREES COOLER NE HALF SUNDAY AND MONDAY MORNINGS AND THEN
WARM AS MOISTURE INCREASES AT MID WEEK.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH A VERY MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL ONLY ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS EVENING...WITH SOME ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY FURTHER NORTH 
CLOSER TO THE COLD FRONT. MODELS INDICATE THAT A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL 
SHORT WAVE IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL HELP TO TRIGGER A LITTLE 
MORE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ALONG THIS COLD FRONT AFTER MIDNIGHT. THIS 
COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY MORNING 
AFTER SUNRISE...WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED ALONG AND AHEAD 
OF IT.

CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL 
UPDATE LATER THIS EVENING TO REMOVE ANY MENTION OF EVENING 
CONVECTION. HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SCATTERED CONVECTION AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE FRONT NEARS THE FORECAST 
AREA. CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT 
THE AREAL COVERAGE OF FOG OVERNIGHT (COMPARED TO LAST NIGHT)...BUT

.AVIATION...LOOKS LIKE THE MOST ORGANIZED AREA OF CONVECTION WAS
OCCURRING ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA
ALONG AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY BUT THIS FEATURE HAS SLIPPED SOUTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA. OTHER...LESS ORGANIZED STORMS ARE MOVING SOUTHEAST
ACROSS EASTERN KENTUCKY AND MAY MOVED ONTO THE PLATEAU BUT THE
PROBABILITY OF A STORM AFFECTING THE TERMINALS THROUGH THE
REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT IS SMALL SO LEFT OUT MENTION IN THE TAFS.
AIRMASS IS NOT QUITE AS MOIST TONIGHT SO FOG WILL BE MAINLY MVFR
CATEGORY BUT THERE IS A CHANCE THAT IFR VSBY WILL
DEVELOP...ESPECIALLY AT TRI LATE TONIGHT. 

UPPER MIDWEST SHORTWAVE WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS EAST ACROSS THE
NORTHEASTERN STATES ON FRIDAY HELPING TO DRIVE COOL FRONT THROUGH
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. APPLIED A VICINITY THUNDER GROUP AT TYS
AND CHA FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A STORM AT THESE TERMINALS WITH A
SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION AT TRI. THEREFORE FORECAST A
PREVAILING THUNDER GROUP HERE WITH THE FRONT MOVING THROUGH AROUND
15-19Z.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEGUN TO DEVELOP IN SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SURROUNDING AREAS. THIS CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH 
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND WEAKEN AFTER SUNSET. WINDS ARE WEAK 
AND THERE IS A GOOD AMOUNT OF MIDLEVEL DRY AIR TO LIMIT SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPMENT. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE OVERNIGHT AHEAD OF A 
FRONT APPROACHING THE AREA FROM THE NORTH. WITH AMOUNT OF MOISTURE 
ALREADY IN AREA FOG LOOKS TO BE PRESENT FRIDAY MORNING.

CONVECTION FROM THIS FRONT EXPECTED TO AFFECT TRI CITIES AREA
EARLY MORNING...WITH KNOXVILLE AND CHATTANOOGA AROUND LATE
MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON. HEAVY RAIN LOOKS TO BE THE BIGGEST THREAT
WITH THIS SYSTEM. PW VALUES ARE AROUND 1.8 WITH INSTABILITIES
AROUND 2000 J/KG. WINDS ARE WEAK WITH VERY LITTLE SHEAR. KEPT LOW
TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES ABOVE GUIDANCE TONIGHT DUE TO THE AMOUNT
OF CLOUDS MOVING INTO THE AREA. HIGH TEMPERATURES TOMORROW ARE
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S.

.LONG TERM.../FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...BY THE START OF THIS 
PERIOD THE WEAK COLD FRONT SHOULD BE THROUGH THE AREA...WITH 
SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR STARTING TO FILL INTO THE REGION.  TRAJECTORY 
FORECASTS SUGGEST THAT THE POST-FRONTAL AIR MASS SOURCE REGION WILL 
BE EASTERN ONTARIO/WESTERN QUEBEC WHERE CURRENT POST-FRONTAL DEW 
POINTS ARE IN THE 45-55 DEGREE RANGE.  WITH THE LONG ANTICYCLONIC 
PATH THIS AIR MASS WILL TAKE ON THE WAY HERE...THE DEW POINTS WILL 
MODIFY QUITE A BIT...BUT EVEN WITH THESE MODIFICATIONS...OUR DEW 
POINTS SHOULD DEFINITELY FALL FROM OUR CURRENT 65-72 DEGREE 
READINGS.  HAVE GONE 1-2 DRIER THAN MODEL GUIDANCE FOR DEW POINTS 
OVERALL THROUGH ABOUT NEXT TUESDAY.  

UPPER HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE PLAINS WILL BE BUILDING OVER THE NEXT 
COUPLE OF DAYS...AND SWELLING FARTHER EAST TO HELP KEEP WEATHER 
SYSTEMS AWAY FROM THE AREA.  THE NEXT HALF-WAY ORGANIZED SYSTEM 
LOOKS TO BE AROUND MID WEEK WHEN A WEAK SYSTEM COMES SOUTH. KEEPING 
POPS RELATIVELY LOW FOR THE LATER PERIODS...THINKING THAT THE UPPER 
RIDGE MAY KEEP THESE CHANCES PUSHED TO OUR EAST AS WELL.  DEFINITELY 
A DRIER PATTERN THAN WE HAVE BEEN IN FOR THE PAST SEVERAL WEEKS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SCATTERED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE/PLATEAU AS
WELL AS A LONG THE TENNESSEE/NORTH CAROLINA STATE LINE THIS
AFTERNOON. THE CONVECTION IS AIDED BY AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE
WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH DAYTIME HEATING PRODUCING MODERATE
INSTABILITY WITH STORM MONITOR AND SPC SHOWING CAPES OF 1000-1500
J/KG. CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EVENING...THEN DIMINISH
IN COVERAGE BY SUNSET. DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH LOW/MID LEVEL CLOUDS
REMAIN...COULD BE AREAS OF FOG OVERNIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING.

FOR WEDNESDAY...UPPER THROUGH WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE
LOWER OHIO VALLEY AND EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY. AS WAS THE CASE FOR
MIDDLE TENNESSEE...SCATTERED/BROKEN CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP A
LITTLE FARTHER EAST INTO MOST OF EAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
AND WESTERN CAROLINA BY AFTERNOON. MODELS SHOW CAPES BETWEEN
1500-2000 J/KG...SO STORMS WILL LIKELY BE A LITTLE STRONGER
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE STRONG/GUSTY WINDS UP TO
40 MPH..LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS AND FREQUENT LIGHTNING. HAVE INCLUDED
IN THE HWO.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...GENERALLY FOLLOWED A MIX OF NAM/GFS DUE TO NEAR
TERM PERFORMANCE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND SHOW NORTHWEST UPPER-LEVEL FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH BUILDING OVER 
THE CENTRAL PORTION OF THE NATION THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. 
IT APPEARS THE NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY 
WILL PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON 
THURSDAY...AND INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY. WHILE THIS COLD 
FRONT WILL HELP TO TRIGGER SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA...TEMPS WILL LIKELY NOT FALL MUCH BEHIND IT FOR THE WEEKEND AS 
A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH BUILDS OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS UPPER 
HIGH SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS MOST CONVECTION THIS WEEKEND AND EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...AS AN INCREASINGLY WARM LAYER IN THE MID LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE HELPS TO CAP THE LOCAL AIR MASS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE

OVER THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SKIES HAVE BEEN MOSTLY CLOUDY 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY WITH SOME PARTIAL CLEARING. SHOWERS 
HAVE BEEN WIDELY SCATTERED THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON... 
MOSTLY OVER SOUTHERN SECTIONS...BUT HAVE INCREASED THE LAST COUPLE 
HOURS AS TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED (ALTHOUGH MORE SLOWLY THAN 
FORECAST).

THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE REGION WILL REMAIN WEAK...BUT THE 
UPPER FLOW AROUND THE UPPER RIDGE OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST WILL 
CONTINUE A SW FLOW OF MOISTURE UP FROM THE GULF INTO THE EASTERN 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. THIS WILL KEEP DEW POINTS UP AND HELP TO DEVELOP 
MORE SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
THROUGH EARLY TONIGHT. DEEPER MOISTURE LOOKS TO SHIFT EAST LATE THIS 
EVENING...WITH MOST OF THE PRECIPITATION ENDING THEN. FOLLOWED CLOSE 
TO MET GUIDANCE FOR TONIGHTS LOWS AND TOMORROW...WITH THE PATTERN

CLOSE TO MET GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL

THEN DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY...WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME ORGANIZED CONVECTION FROM THE 
MID MS AND LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEYS MOVING TOWARDS THE FORECAST

CHANCES AND INCREASE TEMPS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE WEEKEND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE 
REGION WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN TODAY INTO TONIGHT.  LOOKS LIKE THERE 
WILL BE A BIT MORE INSTABILITY TODAY...SO WILL KEEP MENTION OF 
SLIGHT CHANCE THUNDER ALL ZONES. WITH SOME LIMITED DRYING EXPECTED 
TODAY INTO TONIGHT...WILL JUST CARRY CHANCE POPS ALL BUT EASTERN 
MOUNTAINS WHERE WILL GO LOW LIKELY FOR TODAY...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE TO 
LOW CHANCE POPS TONIGHT.  WILL UNDERCUT MAV TEMPS ONLY SLIGHTLY FOR 
TODAY AS DO EXPECT SOME SUN TO BREAK THROUGH...AND HAVE EVEN LESS 
ARGUMENT WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS KEEP UPPER TROUGHING 
AND A FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE AROUND THE MID SOUTH THROUGH MUCH OF 
THE WORK WEEK. A GRADUAL TREND TOWARD HIGHER PRESSURES SEEMS TO BE 
IN THE WORKS AS THE WEEKEND APPROACHES. WITH THIS IN MIND...TRIED TO 
GRADUALLY TAPER POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BACK 
INCREMENTALLY WITH LITTLE CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION BY SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY. THERE IS SOME LEVEL OF FORECAST UNCERTAINTY BY ABOUT FRIDAY 
INTO THE WEEKEND AS THE MODELS ONLY SLOWLY ALLOW FOR THE DEPARTURE 
OF THE EASTERN U.S. LONGWAVE TROUGH. THE PREVAILING NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW BETWEEN THE TROUGH AND THE APPROACHING RIDGE WOULD ARGUE FOR 
THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME UPSTREAM CONVECTION STREAMING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA OR EVEN A BACK DOOR COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY BUILDING 
INTO THE REGION. TRIED TO KEEP AN EVER SO SLIGHTLY HIGHER POP ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE TOWARD THE END OF THE 
PERIOD TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. TEMPERATURES SHOULD SLOWLY 
CLIMB A DEGREE OR EVEN TWO EACH DAY INTO THE END OF THE WORK WEEK 
WITH THE DEPARTURE OF THE UPPER TROUGH. HOWEVER...DID NOT TREND 
QUITE AS WARM AS MOS WHICH SEEMS TO BE A LITTLE OPTIMISTIC 
ESPECIALLY IF THE EASTERN STATES TROUGH HANGS AROUND A LITTLE LONGER 
THAN CURRENT MODEL DEPICTION SUGGESTS. NOTICED EARLIER IN THE SUMMER 
WHEN THE MODELS TRIED TO BRING A MASSIVE UPPER RIDGE INTO THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...WATER VAPOR LOOP SHOWS A
WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE MID-MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY.
THIS TROUGH IS PULLING TROPICAL MOISTURE NORTH TOWARD THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS...HOWEVER CONTINUED CONVECTION ALONG THE CENTRAL GULF
COAST HAS LIMITED DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE MOVING NORTHWARD. STORM
MONITOR SHOWS PWS BETWEEN 1.5 AND 1.75 INCHES. 

GFS AND NAM DEPICT BROAD UPPER DIVERGENCE ALOFT AND WEAK
DEFORMATION ZONE OVER THE AREA TONIGHT...SO EXPECT A BAND OF LIGHT
TO MODERATE RAIN TO MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. IN THE
NEAR TERM...ENOUGH BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS PRODUCING MARGINAL
INSTABILITY (CAPES OF 500-1000 J/KG). I EXPECT CONTINUED
DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED TO BROKEN SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A
THUNDERSTORM THIS THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.

FOR MONDAY...MORE OF THE SAME AS WEAK UPPER TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO
DESTABILZE THE AREA. A LITTLE MORE DAYTIME HEATING WILL PRODUCE
CAPES OF 1000-1500 J/KG DURING THE AFTERNOON. ANOTHER ROUND OF
SCATTERED AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS ANTICIPATED.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WENT TOWARD THE COOLER SIDE OF MAX
TEMPERATURES FOR MONDAY DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND SCATTERED CONVECTION.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE REMAINS 
OVER THE WESTERN STATES AND STRONG RIDGE OFF THE SOUTHEAST COAST. 
THE FORECAST AREA REMAINS NEAR A SHEAR AXIS BETWEEN THESE FEATURES. 
DEEPER MOISTURE IS TRAPPED OVER THE SOUTHEAST EXTENDING NORTH INTO 
THE EASTERN TN VALLEY. A WEAK UPPER TROUGH LIES OVER THE NORTHEAST 
AND MID ATLANTIC WITH WEAK DISTURBANCES PASSING THROUGH THE REGION 
MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST THURSDAY. THE CANADIAN AND GFS DEEPEN 
UPPER TROUGH WITH MORE DISTURBANCES RIDING SOUTHEAST INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA THURSDAY INTO SATURDAY. WHILE THE ECMWF MOVES WEAK 
UPPER LOW AND TROUGH TO THE NE THURSDAY THEN BUILDS A LARGE 
ELONGATED RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHEAST STATES BEGINNING 
FRIDAY AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE WEEKEND. CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR 
THE LAST FEW DAYS THAT WE WILL WARM UP AND DRY OUT TO THE EXTENT OF 
THE ECMWF CONSIDERING THE COOL AND WET TROUGH PATTERN WE HAVE BEEN 
IN LATELY. SO KEEPING CHANCE POPS AND LOWER TEMPERATURES IN FOR 
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AND THEN SLIGHTLY WARMER AND DRIER LAST 3

CONFIDENCE IN MODEL PRECIP DEPICTIONS IS LOW AS FORECAST PRECIP HAS 
FAILED TO MATERIALIZE TODAY. MOS GUIDANCE POPS WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY 
UNDERCUT TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY NORTH. HOWEVER...SOME GENERAL MODEL 
TRENDS CAN BE USED TO EXTRAPOLATE CURRENT OBSERVED CONDITIONS 
THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THE MODELS SHOW THE RIDGE IN THE ATLANTIC 
BUILDING WEST WESTWARD...AND THIS APPEARS REASONABLE WHEN COMPARED 
TO WV AND IR SATELLITE TRENDS. AS THIS OCCURS...THE MOISTURE AXIS 
FROM THE MS/AL COAST TO SC WILL SHIFT INTO THE TN VALLEY...MAINLY ON 
SUNDAY. THE FORECAST TREND WILL BE TO INCREASE POPS FROM SE TO NW 
ACROSS THE AREA TONIGHT...BRINGING POPS INTO THE LIKELY RANGE SUNDAY 
MORNING AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE DAY. OVERCAST CLOUDS AND RAIN 
SHOWERS WILL HOLD TEMPS BACK IN THE LOWER TO MID 70S. WITH VERY 
LITTLE INSTABILITY...NO THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MENTIONED. THE CLOSED 
LOW TO OUR WEST BECOMES AN OPEN WAVE THAT LIFTS NE ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT...SO POPS WILL BEGIN TO DECREASE FROM THE WEST SUNDAY NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
MODEL FORECASTS FOR MONDAY STILL SHOW UPPER TROUGH LIFTING
NORTHEAST WITH BULK OF MOISTURE ALONG AND EAST OF THE APPALCHIANS.
HAVE CONTINUED LOWERING TREND OF POPS MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT.
STATIONARY FRONT TO THE SOUTH KEEPING DEEPER MOISTURE OVER THE
SOUTHEAST STATES. CANADIAN AND GFS MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH TROPICAL
MOISTURE OVER SOUTHERN STATES WITH CANADIAN BRINGING HEAVY RAIN
INTO THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY AS IT MOVES A TROPICAL SYSTEM INTO
THE LOWER MS VALLEY SUNDAY AND THEN NE INTO THE TN VALLEY MONDAY.
GFS BRINGS DEEP MOISTURE FARTHER NORTH WITH GOOD RAIN CHANCES OVER
SOUTHERN SECTIONS AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS ALL WEEK. PREFER DRIER NAM
AND ECMWF THAT KEEP TUESDAY MOSTLY DRY EXCEPT FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS
AND THEN BRING A LITTLE MORE ENERGY MOVES THROUGH THE WEAK NW FLOW
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY FOR HIGHER RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA. FRIDAY AND SATURDAY RIDGING ALOFT OVER THE TN VALLEY
DECREASES RAIN CHANCES AS. HAVE WARMED TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES

A CLOSED UPPER LOW REMAINS STATIONARY OVER WEST TN...WITH A JET
STREAK OVER THE APPALACHIANS. 12Z OHX AND FFC SOUNDINGS SHOW PLENTY
OF MOISTURE BELOW 700 MB...BUT THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY OF LIFT
TO GET MUCH PRECIP GOING. AS WE SAW YESTERDAY...THERE ARE A FEW
LIGHT SHOWERS IN THE SOUTH AND PLATEAU. THE NAM AND GFS SHOW THE
300 MB JET STREAK STRENGTHENING SLIGHTLY AND SHIFTING SLIGHTLY
WESTWARD TODAY...WHICH MAY HELP SPREAD SHOWERS INTO NORTHERN AREAS
THIS AFTERNOON. STILL...ANY PRECIP WILL BE ISOLATED AND VERY LIGHT
WITH THE LACK OF DEEP MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. WILL UPDATE TO
LOWER POPS NORTH AND TO LOWER TEMPS WHERE CLOUD COVER IS THICKEST
THIS MORNING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL REMAIN 
CENTERED JUST TO OUR WEST WITH A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WELL TO OUR 
SOUTHEAST FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.  LOOKS LIKE BEST FORCING WILL 
STAY TO OUR EAST...SO WILL JUST CARRY CHANCE POPS TODAY AND TONIGHT 
WITH THE EXCEPTION OF LOW LIKELY POPS NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS EARLY 
TONIGHT.  INSTABILITY LOOKS TO BE VERY LIMITED SO WILL CONTINUE TO 
ONLY CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE THUNDER THIS AFTERNOON.  OTHERWISE JUST 
SHOWERS.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL NOT STRAY 
FAR.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MISSISSIPPI VALLEY UPPER LEVEL 
LOW SLOWLY WEAKENS WHILE LIFTING OUT ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY 
INTO MONDAY. MODELS AGREE ON SWINGING A FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT SHORT 
WAVE FEATURE AND ASSOCIATED DEEP MOISTURE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS DURING THIS PORTION OF THE FORECAST. THEREFORE STARTED 
POPS OUT IN THE LIKELY CATEGORY ON SUNDAY FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WHILE EDGING BACK TO MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE PROBABILITY 
DURING THE DAY MONDAY WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS JUST TO THE WEST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA...BUT WITH THE DEEPEST MOISTURE PUSHING EAST OF 
THE APPALACHIAN SPINE. PRESSURES WILL BE ON THE RISE WITH A DECREASE 
IN MEAN RELATIVE HUMIDITY FOLLOWING THE DEPARTURE OF THE LONG WAVE 
TROUGH SO TRIED TO KEEP CONVECTIVE POPS IN THE SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE 
FAVORING HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. THE MODELS 
TRY TO BRING A LONG WAVE TROUGH INTO THE NORTHEAST STATES TOWARD THE 
END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. THIS TYPE OF PATTERN MAY BRING A LITTLE 
MORE ORGANIZED CONVECTION INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BUT 
UNCERTAINTY RATHER HIGH THIS FAR OUT IN THE GAME SO JUST TWEAKED 
POPS UP SLIGHTLY ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. STAYED CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE

.DISCUSSION...UPPER TROUGH IS MOVING EAST ACROSS THE LOWER/MID
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY PULLING MOISTURE BACK INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.
STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS ACROSS THE FAR SOUTH GULF COAST STATES.
MODELS SHOW INCREASING FRONTAL-GENETIC FORCING JUST NORTH OF THIS
BOUNDARY LATER TONIGHT AND SATURDAY WITH INCREASING BAND OF SHOWERS
DEVELOPING OVER GEORGIA INTO THE WESTERN CAROLINAS.

FOR TONIGHT...LIFT WILL REMAIN SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA...SO HAVE
LOWERED CHANCES OF SHOWERS FOR THE REST OF TONIGHT. SATELLITE SHOWS
AREA OF 4-6KFT DECK OF CLOUDS ALONG AND SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40.
LATEST MODELS SHOW THIS AREA OF CLOUDS MOVING SLOWLY NORTH...BUT
STILL TRI-CITIES/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WILL REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY MOST
OF THE NIGHT. BECAUSE OF LESS CLOUD COVER...HAVE LOWERED MINS A
DEGREE OR TWO OVER THE NORTHEAST SECTIONS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS HAVE STAYED IN EXTREME SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE 
AREA...ALTHOUGH SOME DEVELOPMENT IS OCCURRING IN THE PLATEAU. 
DOWNSLOPE WINDS ALOFT ARE LIKELY REDUCING CLOUD COVER IN THE 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS. THE SLOW EASTWARD DRIFT OF THE 
LOW OVER ALABAMA TONIGHT IS EXPECTED TO INCREASE 850-700 MB MOISTURE 
A BIT TONIGHT...BUT MUCH OF THE FORCING WITH A JET STREAK STAYS EAST 
OF THE APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. WILL HAVE LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
MAINLY IN SOUTHERN AND EASTERN AREAS TONIGHT. ON SATURDAY THE 
700-500 MB LOW BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED AND CLOSED OFF...BRINGING 
DEEPER GULF MOISTURE. WILL SPREAD CHANCE POPS FARTHER NORTH AND 
WEST...WITH LIKELY POPS EAST CLOSER TO THE STRONGER JET FORCING. 
INSTABILITY APPEARS VERY WEAK WITH PLENTY OF CLOUD COVER...SO WILL 
HAVE JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. POPS DECREASE SATURDAY 
NIGHT AS THE JET WEAKENS AND A SHORTWAVE TROUGH LIFTS NORTH OF THE 
AREA. TEMPS WILL BE ABOVE MOS AT NIGHT AND BELOW MOS DURING THE DAY 
TO ACCOUNT FOR EXPECTED OVERCAST TO BROKEN CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SUNDAY STRONG RIDGING REMAINS 
ALONG THE EAST COAST WITH WEAK TROUGH OR POSSIBLE CLOSED LOW OVER 
THE MID MS VALLEY. MOST OF THE DEEPER MOISTURE FORECAST BY SHORT 
RANGE MODELS TO MOVE NORTH FROM THE GULF ALONG THE WEST SIDE OF THE 
UPPER RIDGE INTO THE SOUTHEAST STATES. THEN MOVE NORTH NORTHEAST 
ALONG OR EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. HOWEVER A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH 
JUST TO THE WEST WILL TRAP SOME MOISTURE ON THE WEST SIDE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS. ALSO IF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF MOVES FAR ENOUGH NW AND 
THEN INLAND INTO TX AND LA IT WILL GET PULLED INTO THE WEAK UPPER 
TROUGH OR LOW.

RAIN CHANCES WILL BE HIGHEST SUNDAY AND THEN DECREASE SLIGHTLY 
MONDAY AS UPPER LOW OR TROUGH WEAKENS. THE AIR MASS WILL BECOME A 
LITTLE MORE UNSTABLE SUNDAY AND AGAIN MONDAY SO THUNDERSTORMS A 
LITTLE MORE LIKELY ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY 
EVENING. UPPER PATTERN BEGINS TO CHANGE MONDAY AS UPPER TROUGH LIFTS 
NE BUT MODELS DISAGREE AFTER THAT WITH THE CANADIAN BRINGING A 
TROPICAL SYSTEM INTO TX AND THEN BRINGING CLOUDS AND RAIN INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA AS IT DISSIPATES AND IS PUSHED EAST MID AND LATE WEEK. 
GFS TRIES TO BUILD A RIDGE OVER THE AREA AT MID WEEK DECREASING 
MOISTURE AND WARMING TEMPERATURES. FINALLY ECMWF KEEPS A TROUGH OR 
FORMS A WEAK UPPER LOW OVER THE TN VALLEY WHICH WOULD EXTEND THE 
COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND WETTER TREND. FOR NOW WILL KEEP 
TEMPERATURES COOL SUNDAY THEN WARM TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY FROM MONDAY 
THROUGH MID WEEK BUT KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS EACH DAY. 
HIGHER CHANCES IN THE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS AND DURING 
PEAK HEATING TIMES.

PRECIP IS STAYING SOUTH OF THE AXIS OF DEFORMATION ACROSS GA/SC. A

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A MID AND UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
DEEPEN TO OUR WEST...AND A WEAK INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WILL EXTEND 
INTO OUR AREA.   MOISTURE WILL INCREASE...BUT INSTABILITY LOOKS VERY 
LIMITED SO WHILE THUNDER CANNOT TOTALLY BE RULED OUT...LOOKS LIKE 
PRECIP SHOULD BE MAINLY SHOWERS. FOR NOW PLAN TO JUST CARRY SHOWERS 
IN THE FORECAST.  BEST COVERAGE SHOULD BE MOUNTAINS AND SOUTH INTO 
CENTRAL TODAY...NORTH AND EAST TONIGHT.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO 
CHANCE POPS BOTH PERIODS. MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL...SO 
JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS.    

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MORE TROFFING IN STORE 
FOR THE AREA OVER THE WEEKEND AS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY EVEN HAS A CLOSED LOW LOOK TO IT IN THE MODELS 
OVER METROPOLIS SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. AT THE SURFACE AN INVERTED 
TROUGH WILL BE IN PLACE INITIALLY OVER MIDDLE AND THEN WESTERN 
TENNESSEE AS THE NEW WEEK BEGINS. MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE 
ON LOW LEVEL SOUTHEASTERLY AND THEN SOUTHERLY FLOW. THERE SHOULD BE 
A DECENT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND MAYBE EVEN SOME THUNDER OVER THE 
WEEKEND. BETTER COVERAGE OF SHOWERS APPEARS TO BE IN THE WORKS 
ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY AS MOISTURE 
DEEPENS COMPLIMENTS OF THE GULF OF MEXICO AND SHORT WAVELENGTH 
ENERGY SWINGS NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY UPPER LOW/TROUGH GRADUALLY LIFTS OUT ACROSS THE 
UPPER OHIO VALLEY ON MONDAY SO IT STILL APPEARS LIKE THERE WOULD BE 
A GOOD CHANCE FOR SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT AT THIS 
TIME. HOWEVER TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY POPS WILL BE ON THE DECLINE 
AS PRESSURES RISE A BIT AND DEEPER MOISTURE GETS SHOVED TO THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD. LOOKS LIKE A MUCH LOWER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION 
DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST.

SOME SHOWER DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTHERN
PORTIONS OF THE AREA...IN THE VICINITY OF AN INVERTED SURFACE
TROUGH AND WEAK INSTABILITY. STABLE FORECAST SOUNDINGS AT TRI
SUGGEST NO PRECIP CHANCES THERE. A DOWNSLOPE WIND COMPONENT SHOULD
ALSO HELP SUPPRESS DEVELOPMENT IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY
AREAS. A SE FLOW UP TO 850 MB WILL PROVIDE BETTER LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE OVER SOUTHERN AREAS. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW
CHANCE POP GOING SOUTH...WITH A FEW MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO FAVOR SW
NC COUNTIES. CLOUD COVER WILL ALSO NEED SOME DOWNWARD ADJUSTMENTS
BASED ON VIS SATELLITE TRENDS. FORECAST HIGH TEMPS IN THE UPPER
70S TO LOWER 80S APPEAR ON TRACK SO FAR.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER TROUGH RE-DEVELOPS
ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH
AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH OVER THE PLATEAU. SATELITE AND SURFACE
OBSERVATIONS ALREADY SHOW BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE INCREASING ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH BROKEN CLOUD COVER. NAM
AND GFS SHOW AIRMASS DESTABILIZING THIS AFTERNOON NEAR THE INVERTED
SURFACE TROUGH WITH CAPES OF 500-1000 J/KG. WILL CONTINUE WITH LOW
CHANCE OF CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHERN AND PLATEAU AREAS FOR THIS
AFTERNOON/EVENING. 

FOR TONIGHT...SURFACE WEDGE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL DEVELOP
EASTERLY WINDS INTO THE MOUNTAINS. AREAS OF SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP
OVER WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA OVERNIGHT..SOME OF THIS RAIN WILL SPILL
INTO THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS. DOWNSLOPE
WINDS INTO THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY WILL LIMIT CHANCES OF
RAIN THERE..SO WENT A LITTLE LOWER POPS THAN GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND INDICATE A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION THIS WEEKEND. LATEST MODEL RUNS REVEAL A 
LITTLE MORE DISCREPANCIES WITH HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE PULLED 
NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS 
WEEKEND. AT THIS POINT...ONLY THE CANADIAN MODEL DEVELOPS A TROPICAL 
SYSTEM IN THE GULF OF MEXICO THIS WEEKEND...BUT ALL THREE EXTENDED 
MODELS (GFS...ECMWF...CANADIAN) BRING AT LEAST SOME MOISTURE INTO 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH THE ECMWF MODEL DEVELOPING THE WETTEST 
SOLUTION. DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTIES WITH THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE 
MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA...WILL PLAN TO ONLY MENTION CHANCE 
POPS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED FORECAST. THIS WET PATTERN WILL BE SLOW 
TO CHANGE...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BECOMES CUT OFF FROM THE MAIN 
NORTHERLY JET STREAM AND A LARGE UPPER RIDGE DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS 
BY THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND 
CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE WEEKEND...AND THEN A 
LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS NEXT WEEK DUE TO THE EXPECTED WET 
PATTERN.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION TODAY WILL SHIFT EAST AND 
BE NEAR THE MID ATLANTIC REGION TOMORROW. THIS WILL GIVE A MORE 
EASTERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW OFF THE ATLANTIC...BRINGING INCREASING 
MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. THIS WILL BRING INCREASING CLOUDS FROM THE 
EAST LATE TONIGHT. MEANWHILE...A WEAK LOW PRESSURE AREA WILL DEVELOP 
OVER SOUTHERN ALABAMA...WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH STRETCHING INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS WILL AID THE DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED TO 
ISOLATED SHOWERS IN THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY AND SW NC. PRECIP SHOULD 
BE LIGHT AS MOISTURE DEPTH IS MAINLY BELOW 700 MB AND INSTABILITY IS 
WEAK. GREATER STABILITY...A LACK OF FORCING FOR LIFT...AND DRY AIR 
ABOVE 700 MB SHOULD PREVENT SHOWER DEVELOPMENT IN NORTHERN AND 
WESTERN AREAS. TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO BE BELOW NORMAL...WITH LOWS 
TONIGHT IN THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S...AND HIGHS TOMORROW IN THE 
UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
WILL BE IN AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE EXTENDED. AN UPPER
TROUGH WILL DROP INTO THE REGION EARLY IN THE PERIOD AS A SERIES OF
WEAK IMPULSES MOVE THROUGH. THIS SCENARIO WILL PROVIDE SCATTERED
CONVECTION ON AND OFF THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED. THE MAIN CONCERN
THROUGH THE PERIOD IS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING IN FROM THE GULF
PULLING TROPICAL MOISTURE NORTHWARD. HOWEVER...MODELS SHOW SOME
DISCREPANCY AS TO WHETHER THIS MOISTURE WILL REACH INTO EAST TN. IF
THIS MOISTURE WORKS INTO THE MRX CWA...THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN
AND ASSOCIATED LOCALIZED FLOOD INCREASES...MAINLY DURING THE
WEEKEND TIME FRAME. BY THE END OF THE PERIOD...THE CENTRAL U.S.
RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD EASTWARD AND SHOULD AT LEAST BRIEFLY
REDUCE PRECIP CHANCES.

CLOUDS (4KFT) WILL BE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST

AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED

UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL

SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL FOR SEVERAL DAYS. WITH THE GROUND 
ALREADY VERY SATURATED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WILL PLAN TO

HIGH HUMIDITY AND NEVER ENDING RAIN MAY BE IN SIGHT AS AN AMPLIFIED 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SHIFTS FROM THE APPALACHIANS THIS EVENING TO NEW 
ENGLAND BY WEDNESDAY EVENING. WITHIN THE CYCLONIC FLOW PATTERN...A 
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA. THE TROUGH IS BUILDING JUST SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40 AT THE 
CURRENT HOUR AND SHOULD EXIT THE REGION BY 00Z WEDNESDAY WHILE THE 
COLD FRONT BUILDS INTO THE NORTH LATE THIS EVENING AND EXITS BY 12Z 
WEDNESDAY. THERE SHOULD BE A FEW SHOWERS AROUND THE AREA WITH THESE 
BOUNDARIES LIFTING THE HUMID AIRMASS. NOT REAL CONFIDENT IN THE 
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION SO FORECAST SHOWERS WITH THE ACTION TONIGHT. 
BELIEVE THERE WILL BE SOME LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG LEFT BEHIND THE 
FRONTAL PUSH LATE TONIGHT BUT THIS POST FRONTAL MESS MAY BE GONE BY 
MID MORNING OVER MOST OF THE REGION AS A STRONGER NORTHERLY FLOW 
FILLS IN ON STRENGTHENING SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE. SHOULD BE A DRY DAY 
EVERYWHERE BUT EXTREME SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA ON WEDNESDAY WHERE THE MODELS CONTINUE TO POINT TOWARD SOME 
LINGERING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WHICH MAY PRESENT ITSELF IN THE 
FORM OF A COUPLE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM. NOT SURE HOW 
COOL IT WILL BE ON WEDNESDAY WITH QUITE A BIT OF STILL STRONG AUGUST 
SUNSHINE RETURNING BUT THOUGHT IT BEST TO STAY RIGHT IN THE MIDDLE 
OF MAV/MET GUIDANCE WITH THE NORTHERLY WIND COMPONENT. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO 
CURRENT FORECAST. SURFACE RIDGING WILL BE IN CONTROL EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD...PRODUCING DRY CONDITIONS..EXCEPT FOR SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA. THE DRY WEATHER DOES NOT STAY AROUND LONG AS AN INVERTED 
SURFACE TROUGH SETS UP ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY INTO THE WEEKEND. 
THIS ALLOWS MOIST LOW LEVEL SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW TO RETURN TO THE 
AREA. UPPER TROUGH CONTINUES WEST OF THE AREA WITH SOUTHWESTERLY 
LAYER FLOW AND INCREASED MOISTURE IN THE LAYER THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH OVER SOUTHEAST KY...WITH A COLD FRONT OVER THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY. AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER KY 
AHEAD OF THIS PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND COLD FRONT...AS A BROAD UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THIS UPPER 
TROUGH IS PROGGED TO PUSH THIS COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
TODAY...WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING ALONG AND AHEAD OF IT. 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE TO BE A CONCERN TODAY WITH SOME 
CONVECTION...AS A VERY HUMID AIR MASS LINGERS OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES IN THE 1.5 TO 2.0 INCH RANGE. 
IT APPEARS THAT ANY FLOODING CONCERNS WILL NOT BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH 
TO JUSTIFY A FLASH FLOOD WATCH...BUT WILL MENTION 'LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL POSSIBLE' IN THE ZONE FORECASTS. MODELS INDICATE THAT THE 
COLD FRONT WILL QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS 
EVENING...WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE CONSIDERING THE FAIRLY STRONG 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BEHIND IT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL 
COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE RIDGING WILL BE IN 
CONTROL FOR WEDNESDAY PRODUCING DRY CONDITIONS..EXCEPT FOR SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA. THE DRY WEATHER DOES NOT STAY AROUND LONG AS AN 
INVERTED TROUGH SETUP ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY AS WELL AS RIDGING INTO THE CAROLINAS HELPING TO PULL 
MOISTURE BACK INTO THE REGION.  

FOR THE WEEKEND THROUGH MONDAY...BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF AGREE WITH 
TROUGHING REMAINING OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH MAINLY DIURNAL 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING EACH DAY AS GULF MOISTURE 
RESIDES OVER THE AREA.

DUE TO CONTINUE CHANCES OF CONVECTION AND CLOUD COVER...GENERALLY 
WENT A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN GFX MOS HIGHS THROUGH THE 
PERIOD...ESPECIALLY OVER THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WHERE LOW-CLOUDINESS 
WILL PERSIST THE LONGEST DUE TO WEDGING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS 
INTO NORTHERN GEORGIA.

.DISCUSSION...UPPER LOW CONTINUES MOVING SOUTH OVER SOUTHERN CANADA
WITH TROUGH DIGGING SOUTH THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY.
TROPICAL AIR MASS TO THE SOUTH WITH HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES
AND DAY TIME HEATING MADE AIR MASS UNSTABLE OVER THE TN VALLEY TODAY.
NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MOVED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

THE STORMS HAVE WEAKENED THE LAST FEW HOURS BUT SIGNIFICANT SHORT
WAVE ROTATING THROUGH THE LOWER OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS SPARKED
LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION OVER WESTERN KY AND TN AND INTO AR EARLY
THIS EVENING. THE STRONGEST ACTIVITY IS NOW SHIFTING SOUTHEAST INTO
MS AND AL WITH ANOTHER PART MOVING EAST ACROSS KY. SHOWERS AND
STORMS BROUGHT HEAVY RAIN TO NE AND SE SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST
AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WITH RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF AN INCH OR
TWO IN A FEW SPOTS.

DURING THE REMAINDER OF THE NIGHT THE SHORT WAVE TROUGH AHEAD OF
THE FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION LATER TONIGHT WITH SHOWERS AND
SOME STORMS REDEVELOPING. BECAUSE TIME OF DAY WILL BE LATE DO NOT
EXPECT SEVERE BUT WHERE HEAVY RAIN HAS ALREADY FALLEN SOME RUNOFF
PROBLEMS COULD RESULT. OUTSIDE OF RAIN AREAS PATCHY FOG IS LIKELY
LATE. ADJUSTED HOURLY TEMPERATURE GRIDS DOWN SLIGHTLY AS EARLIER
RAIN LOWERED TEMPERATURES AND SPED UP SLIGHTLY THE HIGHER POPS FOR
THE EARLY MORNING HOURS. FORECAST UPDATE SENT.

THE MAIN IMPULSE AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT MOVES IN AROUND 06-09Z CHA
TO TRI ALTHOUGH WEAKENING SO USED PREVAILING THUNDER GROUP FOR CHA

NEAR TRI SO VCTS AT THAT TIME AND THEN RENEWED ACTIVITY NEAR FRONT
AT CHA AND TYS ABOUT 15-16Z SO SWITCHED TO PREVAILING THUNDER
THERE. WIND SHIFT AND SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR MASS MOVES IN FROM 18 TO

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...THERE WILL BE A FEW SHOWERS AND 
A COUPLE THUNDERSTORMS AROUND DURING THE EVENING. HOWEVER...RAINFALL 
MAY BECOME A LITTLE MORE WIDESPREAD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATER 
TONIGHT AS A HEALTHY SHORT WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY OVER THE 
MIDWEST...BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. USED LIKELY 
POPS FOR THE EVENT WHICH WILL BE COMING INTO THE WESTERN REACHES OF 
THE VIEWING AREA AROUND 06Z WITH EXIT AROUND 12-14Z. THE SYSTEM WILL 
NOT HAVE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE INSTABILITY DUE TO THE 
LATE NIGHT ARRIVAL SO CONVECTION SHOULD BE HELD IN CHECK. 
CERTAINLY...WITH THE RECENT HIGHER RAINFALL TOTALS MAINLY ACROSS THE 
NORTHWEST HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...THERE COULD BE SOME LOCALIZED 
FLASH FLOODING WITH THE ADDITIONAL RAIN. A COOL FRONT WILL FINALLY 
BE MOVING INTO THE REGION ON TUESDAY AND COULD SPARK A FEW SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE DAY AS IT FOLLOWS THE OVERNIGHT SYSTEM. 
TRIED TO TAPER POPS BACK ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE DAY AS DRIER AND 
MORE STABLE AIR FILTERS INTO NORTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS. STAYED 
IN THE MIDDLE GROUND BETWEEN WARMER MAV AND COOLER MET MOS 
CONCERNING HIGH TEMPERATURES ON TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...BROAD UPPER TROUGH MOVES 
SLOWLY SOUTH INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY EARLY IN THE PERIOD. THE LONG 
STANDING COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE SE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
BY WEDNESDAY. THE AIRMASS WILL DRY OUT CONSIDERABLY BY WED 
AFTERNOON. SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE...MAINLY ACROSS 
THE SE MOUNTAINS WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW MAY ENHANCE DEVELOPMENT FOR THE 
END OF THE WORK WEEK. TROUGH CONTINUES TO DIG WEST OF THE AREA AND 
IS TRENDING TO CUT OFF BY THE WEEKEND. DRY PERIOD IS SHORT LIVED AS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY RETURNS NORTH AS AN INVERTED TROUGH. PWAT VALUES 
BEGIN TO RISE THURSDAY AND CONTINUE TO RISE INTO THE WEEKEND. 
TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL.

.AVIATION...SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND SOME THUNDERSTORMS
BUILDING INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. LOOKS LIKE TWO MAIN
FEATURES TO KEY ON. INITIAL SHORT WAVE GRINDING ITS WAY EAST INTO
THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING WILL REQUIRE SOME
PERIODIC MVFR RESTRICTIONS TO FLIGHT. LATER TONIGHT THE MAIN
IMPULSE BUILDS IN AROUND 06-12Z AND USED A PREVAILING THUNDER GROUP
FOR THIS ACTION. DIFFICULT TO SAY WHAT WILL BE AROUND AFTER 14Z
WITH MAIN SHORT WAVE EAST OF THE TERMINALS. HOWEVER...THERE COULD
BE SOME SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A LITTLE THUNDER ALONG THE TRAILING

.DISCUSSION...ANOTHER DAY OUT AHEAD OF A FRONTAL BOUNDARY PARKED
JUST NORTHWEST OF THE FORECAST AREA. STARTING OUT WITH SOME LOW
CLOUDS AND FOG HANGING AROUND THE NORTHERN THROUGH CENTRAL SECTIONS
OF THE GREAT VALLEY. IT SHOULD BURN OFF DURING THE NEXT COUPLE
HOURS ALLOWING FOR SOME HEATING OF THE LOW LEVEL AIRMASS. NICE
LITTLE AREA OF THUNDERSTORMS PROGRESSING EAST ACROSS MIDDLE
TENNESSEE. SUPPOSE SOME OF THIS ACTION CAN GET ON THE NORTHERN
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU SO TWEAKED POPS A BIT HIGHER IN THIS AREA AND
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. ELSEWEHRE...SHOULD BE SOME SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDER AROUND AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON. ADJUSTED MAX
TEMPS BACK A DEGREE OR TWO ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU IN THE AREA WHERE THE THUNDERSTORM
COMPLEX AND ASSOCIATED MID DECK HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT. WOULD
EXPECT A LITTLE MORE IN THE WAY OF NOCTURNAL CONVECTION OVERNIGHT

INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MOIST LOW LEVEL AIR MASS CONTINUES 
ACROSS THE REGION FOR THESE FIRST TWO PERIODS.  AGAIN HAVE PATCHY 
FOG MENTIONED FOR THIS MORNING.  DEEP CONVECTION SHOULD BLOSSOM 
AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON WITH SHOWERS AND SOME STORMS. HOWEVER...MODELS 
INDICATE THAT TODAY THERE WILL BE NO DISTURBANCES TO ENHANCE 
STORMS/PRECIPITATION...SO QPF SHOULD BE FAIRLY LIGHT.

FOR TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH NIGHTTIME COOLING WILL BE TAKING 
EFFECT...MODELS AGREE THAT A DISTURBANCE WILL MARCH INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE WEST.  THE TIMING IS UNCERTAIN...SO THE POP TONIGHT IS JUST 
ONE 12-HOUR BLOCK.  

FOR TEMPERATURES...WENT A LITTLE COOLER THAN GFS MOS GUIDANCE FOR 
MAX TEMPS IN THE WESTERN 1/2 OF THE AREA...WITH WESTERN-MOST 
LOCATIONS ABOUT A CATEGORY LOWER.  

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION ON TUESDAY AS AN UPPER-LEVEL 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AMPLIFIES OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. 
ALL MODELS SEEM TO INDICATE THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS AND STORMS PUSHING ACROSS THE AREA FROM NORTHWEST TO 
SOUTHEAST WITH THE MOVEMENT OF THE FRONT. GIVEN THIS GOOD MODEL 
CONSENSUS FOR SEVERAL DAYS NOW...HAVE OPTED TO INCREASE POPS TO 
CATEGORICAL OVER MOST OF THE EASTERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE AREA ON 
TUESDAY. MODELS HAVE COME MORE INTO AGREEMENT OF THE FRONT CLEARING 
THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...SO HAVE CONTINUED TO 
CAUTIOUSLY SHOW THIS TREND WHICH WOULD SUPPORT MORE WIDELY SCATTERED 
ACTIVITY ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...LATE THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT 
AND FRIDAY ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH IS PROGGED TO GRADUALLY MOVE IN FROM 
THE WEST AND COMBINE WITH ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE TO ONCE AGAIN GIVE 
US A DECENT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS ONCE AGAIN FRIDAY INTO THE 
WEEKEND. THE BETTER DAYS LOOKS TO BE ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY ATTM AS 
THE BASE OF THE TROUGH WILL APPROACH AND PASS ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. 

GIVEN THE VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE AND THE  ALREADY SATURATED SOIL 
CONDITIONS...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING IS PROBABLE IN 
AREAS THAT RECEIVE MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF PRECIPITATION. ALSO...WITH THE 
EXPECTED CLOUD COVER/PRECIPITATION CHANCES...HAVE TRENDED SLIGHTLY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...CONVECTION FROM EARLIER
TODAY WAS EXITING THE NE PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...WITH TSRA
FIRING MAINLY ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...SE TN AND SW NC AT
FORECAST TIME. STORMS OVER NORTHERN AREAS MOVING CLOSER TO 20
MPH...WHILE SRN STORMS WERE SLIGHTLY MORE SLUGGISH AND SLIPPING
ESE. MESO ANALYSIS OF 18Z SURFACE DATA DOES NOT REVEAL MUCH
ORGANIZED AREAS OF CONVERGENCE...SO THINK POPS CAN BE KEPT AROUND
30 TO 40 PERCENT FOR THIS EVENING...ABOVE THE SLIGHT CHANCE GFS MOS
POPS. ADDED SCATTERED WORDING WITH LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS MENTIONED. 
LOSS OF HEATING SHOULD DEAL A MAJOR BLOW TO COVERAGE...WHILE
PARTIAL CLEARING LEADS TO AREAS OF FOG LATE.

FOR MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...AIRMASS JUST ISNT MUCH DIFFERENT AT
ALL FOR MONDAY. THUS...EXPECT A BRIEF LULL OVERNIGHT INTO MONDAY
MORNING THEN SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND STORMS TO DEVELOP
YET AGAIN. SEEMS TO BE A WEAK SHORTWAVE MONDAY TO AID COVERAGE AND
A STRONGER ONE FOR TUESDAY. THIS LEAD ME TO KEEP POPS AT LIKELY FOR
BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY. 

GFS MOS MINS GENERALLY FOLLOWED AND CONTINUED TO UNDERCUT GFS MOS
MAXES EACH DAY...STAYING CLOSER TO A BLEND WITH THE COOLER NAM MOS.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ANOMALOUSLY DEEP EASTERN 
STATES UPPER TROUGH BECOMES EVEN DEEPER TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY 
PULLING COOLER AND GRADUALLY DRIER INTO THE REGION LEADING TO LOWER 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION. MODELS TRY TO BRING SOME MOISTURE AND 
PRECIPITATION BACK INTO THE FORECAST AREA AS EARLY AS THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY WITH MORE UPPER LEVEL TROUGHINESS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE 
EASTERN U.S. HOWEVER...WITH SUCH AN AMPLIFIED NORTHWESTERLY 
PREVAILING FLOW PATTERN DEVELOPING DON'T SEE HOW THE REGION MOISTENS 
UP ENOUGH FOR WIDESPREAD SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT UNTIL 
ABOUT SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WHEN THE UPPER TROUGH SHARPENS ACROSS THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY/MIDWEST STATES. SHOULD BE ENOUGH MOISTURE RETURN 
AND INSTABILITY BY THE WEEKEND FOR A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SO TWEAKED THE POPS A BIT FOR THIS LATE 
PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. MODELS CONTINUE TO TRY TO LOWER MAX TEMPS 
DURING THE PERIOD WITH THE NORTHWEST FLOW IN PLACE...BUT LATE SUMMER 
INSOLATION STILL STRONG AND WITH INCREASING AMOUNTS OF SUNSHINE IN 
THE DRIER AIRMASS PUSHED MAXES UP A COUPLE DEGREES ABOVE GUIDANCE

NORTH OF TN/KY STATELINE EAST INTO SW VA. COVERAGE HAS INCREASED 
ENOUGH...THAT I WILL LIKELY UPDATE GRIDS AND PRODUCTS BY MID MORNING

PRESSURE SYSTEM AMPLIFIES OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY...SENDING A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES INTO THE MOISTURE RICH 
ENVIRONMENT IN PLACE OVER OUR REGION. SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION 
IS EXPECTED FOR MONDAY BEFORE A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE REGION 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE UPPER-LOW AMPLIFIES. THINK THAT TUESDAY 
WILL SEE THE BEST CHANCE FOR WIDESPREAD AND LOCALLY HEAVY 
PRECIPITATION GIVEN THE FRONT THAT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA FROM THE WEST. WITH THE VERY MOIST ENVIRONMENT IN 
PLACE AND STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT...MODELS ARE GENERATING SOME 
STRONG QPF SIGNALS TUESDAY AND SO HAVE INCREASED POPS TO HIGH-END 
LIKELY DURING THIS TIME PERIOD...BEFORE SHOWING A GRADUALLY WANING 
TREND TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT MOVES EAST. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE 
WITH THIS ACTIVITY...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND FLOODING IS PROBABLE 
IN AREAS THAT RECEIVE MULTIPLE ROUNDS OF PRECIPITATION GIVEN THE 
VERY MOIST ENVIRONMENT AND SATURATED SOIL CONDITIONS. 

THERE IS SOME VARIABILITY BETWEEN THE MODELS AS TO HOW FAST THE 
FRONT WILL CLEAR THE AREA...SO HAVE KEPT CHANCE POPS IN PLACE ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...WITH A DRIER 
NORTHWEST FLOW IN PLACE BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...A BREAK IN THE 
PRECIPITATION MAY OCCUR HEADING INTO THURSDAY. HOWEVER...A RETURN TO 
A MOIST GULF FETCH FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND AND THE PASSAGE OF SOME 
ADDITIONAL UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCES WILL WARRANT CHANCE POPS TO 
CLOSE OUT THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...ORGANIZED CONVECTION 
CONTINUES OVER NE TN AND SW VA...WHICH ORIGINATED EARLIER ALONG OR 
NEAR THE STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY...AND ALSO A SIGNIFICANT INCREASE 
IN CONVECTION OVER THE PAST 1 TO 2 HOURS FROM NRN AL NE INTO SE TN. 
STORMS GENERALLY STAYING BELOW SEVERE THUS FAR...ALTHO SOME LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINS DID OCCUR OVER EXTREME NRN PARTS OF SCOTT COUNTY TN. A 
GUST TO 30 MPH NOTED WITH A PASSING TSRA AT CHA. 

PREVIOUS LATE AFTERNOON GRIDS WITH 50 TO 70 PERCENT RAIN CHANCES ARE 
HOLDING UP WELL...AND I TWEAKED THE POPS FOR EARLY TONIGHT (OUT TO 
11/06Z) UP TO LOWER END OF LIKELY OVER SW VA AND MOST OF NE TN. 
THINK ADDING LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS IS A WISE 
MOVE. 

OTHERWISE...FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOOKS TO STAY TO OUR NORTH FOR THESE 
PERIODS. THIS LEAVES OUR CONVECTION MORE ON THE RANDOM OR JUST 
BRIEFLY ORGANIZED PATTERN THROUGH MONDAY. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS IN THE 
AFTERNOONS AND EVENINGS APPEAR TO BE A PROLONGED THREAT. HARD TO 
TIME CONVECTION OR HIGHLIGHT AREAS FOR BEST DEVELOPMENT...SO JUST 
MADE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUS WEATHER/POP GRIDS FOR NOW. 

GFS MINS FOLLOWED CLOSELY...BUT OPTED FOR A BLEND OF THE COOLER NAM 
AND HOTTER GFS MOS FOR MAX TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...EASTERN U.S. UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH DEEPENS TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY WHICH HELPS TO DRIVE A 
COOL FRONT THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THIS TIME FRAME. 
STAYED WITH A HIGHER CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH A NICE 
BIT OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND FRONTAL PUSH ON TUESDAY TAPERING BACK 
TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY. ENOUGH DRY AIR 
WILL BE IN PLACE WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY FAR ENOUGH SOUTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA THAT POPS WERE REMOVED OVER MOST OF THE REGION 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. HOWEVER...NO REST FOR THE WEARY AS 
TROUGHINESS GRADUALLY BECOMES REVITALIZED OVER THE EASTERN STATES 
AGAIN FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY. ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE WILL BE 
AVAILABLE IN THE PRESENCE OF THE UPPER TROUGH FOR SLIGHT AND SMALL 
CHANCE POPS FOR A FEW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS THE WEEKEND 
BEGINS.

.DISCUSSION...13Z SURFACE ANALYSIS PLACES THE STALLED FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY FROM A LOW OVER SE AR ACROSS NW TN TO JUST NW OF BNA
EASTWARD ACROSS SE KY BETWEEN LOZ AND JKL. MORNING CONVECTION SEEMS 
TO BE TRAINING ALONG THIS FEATURE...HAVING HAD SOME LOCALLY VERY 
HEAVY RAINS IN JOHNSON COUNTY TN. RADAR ESTIMATES WERE GENERALLY 2 
TO 4 INCHES IN THAT AREA OVERNIGHT WITH JOHNSON COUNTY MIDDLE SCHOOL 
GAGE (MOUNTAIN CITY) MEASURING 3.62 INCHES FROM MIDNIGHT TO 8 AM EDT.

12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW EAST TO WEST FLOW ALOFT...SO FRONT WILL BE 
SLUGGISH TO PUSH MUCH SOUTHWARD TODAY. 12Z SOUNDINGS FROM OHX AND 
RNK SHOW HIGH MOISTURE WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER RUNNING 1.75 TO 2.00 
INCHES AS OVER PAST FEW DAYS. MODIFIED SOUNDINGS YIELD POSITIVE CAPE 
OF AROUND 2000 J/KG WITH TEMPS REACHING INTO THE 80S. 

THINK I WILL ADJUST FORECAST GRIDS A BIT IN A LATE MORNING UPDATE... 
TO REFLECT HIGHER RAIN CHANCES OVER NORTHERN AREAS (NEAR THE FRONT) 
AND ALSO HIGHLIGHT THUNDERSTORMS MORE THAN CHANCE WORDING. ALSO...
GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR TRAINING OF STORMS I WILL MENTION LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINS...AS NOTED IN THE UPDATED EXCESSIVE RAINFALL OUTLOOK FOR 
TODAY. MAIN CONCERNS REMAIN FLOODING...WHICH HAS OCCURRED SO FAR 
JUST IN A FEW COUNTIES NOT REALLY AREAWIDE AT ALL.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
MORE OF THE SAME...ALTHOUGH THE MAIN STORM TRACK FROM W TN TO E KY MAY
SAG A LITTLE SOUTHWARD TOWARD OUR AREA OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THE
TIMING OF WEAK SHORTWAVES AND BREAKS IN THE CLOUDINESS WILL MAKE
MAX TEMPS TODAY IFFY EITHER DIRECTION BUT WILL STICK CLOSE TO A
ROUGH AVERAGE OF MIDISH 80S IN THE VALLEY EVEN THOUGH WE SAW UPPER
80S TO 90 ON FRIDAY AND LOW TO MID 80S ON THURSDAY. LOCALIZED HEAVY
RAIN AMOUNTS REMAIN POSSIBLE TODAY AND TONIGHT HERE AND THERE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A WET PATTERN WILL CONTINUE INTO NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM AMPLIFIES OVER THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO 
VALLEY...SENDING A SERIES OF SHORTWAVES INTO THE MOISTURE RICH 
ENVIRONMENT IN PLACE OVER OUR REGION. THUS...REASONABLE CHANCES FOR 
SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION WILL EXIST FOR MOST OF THE 
UPCOMING WEEK. A COLD FRONT WILL BE EXITING THE AREA ON 
SUNDAY....LEADING TO SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS IT MOVES THROUGH 
/WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES FAVORING THE EASTERN ZONES/. MORE WIDELY 
SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION IS EXPECTED FOR MONDAY BEFORE 
ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVES BEGIN TO DROP SOUTH OUT OF THE OHIO VALLEY AND 
INTO THE REGION TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS THE UPPER-LOW AMPLIFIES. 
HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY ON TUESDAY AS MODELS ARE INDICATING  
ANOTHER FRONT PROGRESSING TOWARD THE AREA RESULTING A FEW ROUNDS OF 
HEAVIER SHOWERS AND STORMS BEGINNING LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
BEFORE SLOWLY TAPERING OFF TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING. 

ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE PASSAGES ON WEDNESDAY AND TO A LESSER EXTENT 
THURSDAY WILL LEAD TO CHANCE POPS ONCE AGAIN ON THOSE DAYS AS THE 
UNSETTLED PATTERN CONTINUES. SOME SLIGHTLY DRIER CONDITIONS COULD BE 
IN STORE FOR FRIDAY...THOUGH IT APPEARS THAT GULF MOISTURE AND 
ADDITIONAL UPPER-WAVES MAY LEAD TO ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES HEADING 
INTO NEXT WEEKEND AS WELL. GIVEN THE VERY MOIST ATMOSPHERE AND THE 
ALREADY SATURATED SOIL CONDITIONS...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND

EASTERN KY MAY HELP TO STABILIZE NORTHERN SECTIONS SO EXPECTING
ACTIVITY TO LESSEN OR MOVE EAST OF THE NORTHEAST SECTIONS BY LATE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FEW AREAS OF CONVECTION
TRYING TO GET ORGANIZED THIS AFTERNOON...OVER SRN MIDDLE TN INTO NW AL
THE CENTRAL AND NE PARTS OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND OVER SW NC
EAST TO GSP. FIRST AREAS APPEAR TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH AN EARLIER
OUTFLOW BOUNDARY...AND THE LAST AREA MOST LIKELY DUE TO OROGRAPHIC
LIFT OR CONVERGENCE. WHAT EVOLVES FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE
AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT IS STILL CHALLENGING...GIVEN THE WEAK
FRONTAL BOUNDARY STILL WELL TO OUR N-NW. LIKELY SHOWERS AND
SCATTERED STORMS STILL LOOKS LIKE A GOOD START...AND QUITE CLOSE TO
OR JUST ABOVE GFS MOS POPS FOR TONIGHT. 

AIRMASS HAS BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...
ESPECIALLY WRN AREAS. HIGHLY MOIST AIRMASS AND WETTER THAN NORMAL
GROUNDS FOR EARLY AUGUST SUGGEST A FLOOD CONCERN. HOWEVER...STORM
MOTION IS MUCH FASTER THAN YESTERDAY (ENE AT 20 TO 25 MPH)...AND A
SYNOPTIC FEATURE TO FOCUS CONVERGENCE IS STILL LACKING. NO DEFINITE
UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT OVERNIGHT...SO COVERAGE AND INTENSITY MAY
DIMINISH AFTER 10/06Z. POCKETS OF HEAVY RAINFALL OVER THE PAST 2 TO
3 DAYS HAVE BEEN RANDOM AND VERY LIMITED...SO CONSIDERING ALL OF
THESE FACTORS...OPTED TO NOT ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR NOW. I DID
HIGHLIGHTED LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS TONIGHT AND AGAIN ON SATURDAY.

OTHERWISE...STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR SATURDAY
THROUGH SUNDAY...WITH SLIGHT CHANGES TO LOWER POPS A BIT FOR
SUNDAY. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO SAG SOUTH SATURDAY... 
BUT COULD LIFT NORTH OF THE REGION BY SATURDAY NIGHT OR SUNDAY. 
MOS POPS AND MIN TEMPS CLOSELY FOLLOWED...BUT STAYED BELOW THE GFS
MOS FOR MAX TEMPS EACH DAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...UNSETTLED CONDITIONS
WILL PERSIST IN THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST AS SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO FORM IN THE MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS IN
THE WARM SECTOR OUT AHEAD OF A COOL FRONT WHICH EDGES VERY SLOWLY
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. KEPT LOW THROUGH MEDIUM
CHANCE POPS FOR THE PRECIPITATION EXCEPT ON TUESDAY WHEN A STRONGER
SHORT WAVE TROUGH RIDES OVER THE BOUNDARY ENHANCING THE POSSIBILITY
OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. GRADUALLY TAPERED POPS BACK WEDNESDAY
THROUGH FRIDAY AS THE SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY PUSHES JUST A LITTLE
FURTHER SOUTH OF THE REGION. SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL MAX TEMPS WERE
PREFERRED IN THIS SEEMINGLY NEVER ENDING ANOMALOUS PATTERN
FEATURING AN AMPLIFIED EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH.

SHOWER ACTIVITY HAS ENDED ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. THE NAM HAS DONE
A POOR JOB DEPICTING THE EVENING PRECIP...SO THE RUC IS PREFERED. THE
RUC SHOWS SOME PRECIP MOVING IN FROM THE WEST LATE TONIGHT...SO
WILL KEEP A CHANCE POP GOING THERE WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE ELSEWHERE.
LIKE LAST NIGHT...LOW STRATUS WILL DEVELOP AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH
LIGHT FOG IN SOME AREAS. OBSERVED TEMPS ARE A BIT BELOW

BASED ON CURRENT DEWPOINT TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...STILL LOOKING TO BE A
VERY MOIST AND UNSTABLE PERIOD WITH LIKELY OR HIGHER POPS NEEDED AT
TIMES...AND HARDER TO DEFINE WHEN AND WHERE BY THE 3RD AND 4TH
PERIODS. CERTAINLY BEST COVERAGE ALONG OR JUST AHEAD OF THE WEAK
FRONTAL BOUNDARY...WHICH MOVES EVER SO SLIGHTLY SE WITH TIME.

BEST COVERAGE HAS GENERALLY ALREADY OCCURRED THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS
THE NRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT NOTHING REALLY NOTEWORTHY
AS FAR AS HEAVY RAINS. STRONGER CONVECION WITH VERY HEAVY RAINS
OVER MIDDLE TN WITH NEW DEVELOPMENT POISED TO TRACK INTO SE TN BY
LATE AFTERNOON OR EARLY EVENING. ELSEWHERE...THINK CONVECTION WILL
LIKELY BE MORE RANDOM IN COVERAGE THIS EVENING WITH A TENDENCY TO
DIMINISH AFTER 06Z FRIDAY. OPTED TO CONTINUE THE HIGH PRE 09/00Z
POPS IN THE GRIDS...THEN A RANGE OF 40 TO 60 PERCENT POPS FOR EARLY
TONIGHT WITH SCATTERED WORDING WHERE HIGH CHANCE POPS WERE USED. 
ALSO...CARRIED A MENTION OF HEAVY RAINS THROUGH FIRST HALF OF
TONIGHT GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT AND RATHER SLOW MOVEMENT.

OTHERWISE...KEPT GOOD CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR FRIDAY
THROUGH SATURDAY WITH JUST SOME VERY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS. A BIT
PUZZLED AS TO HOW WARM THE GFS MOS MAX TEMPS ARE FOR FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY. EVEN A BLEND WITH THE LOWER NAM MOS MAXES WOULD APPEAR TO
BE TOO WARM...SO I STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR EACH DAY.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A COOL FRONT WILL BE 
WORKING ITS WAY SLOWLY THROUGH THE AREA SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL ACCOMPANY THIS FEATURE IN A 
RATHER MOIST ENVIRONMENT AHEAD OF THE FRONT. MORE ENERGY DROPS 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY 
AMPLIFYING THE UPPER FLOW. THIS AMPLIFICATION SHOULD HELP ANOTHER 
COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIDE THROUGH THE REGION AND BUMPED UP 
CONVECTIVE POPS TO GOOD CHANCE FOR THIS EVENT. GRADUALLY TAPER BACK 
THE CHANCE POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY AS THE LIFTING INFLUENCE FROM THE SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY 
PRESSES SOUTH. APPLIED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM ON THURSDAY WITH MODELS HINTING AT MORE SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY BUILDING INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. STAYED CLOSER TO THE 
ECM TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

1.70 INCHES (RNK). LINGERING/DEVELOPING MCS OVER MIDDLE TN IS 
WORKING MORE EAST THAN SOUTH...ENTERING THE NW QUADRANT OF OUR 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS MAIN THREAT THIS 
AFTERNOON...GIVEN THE HIGH K INDEX AND RELATIVELY SLOW STORM 
MOVEMENT (E OR SE AT 15 MPH). 

HIGH RAIN CHANCES ACROSS NRN HALF OF THE FORECAST LOOK GOOD FOR 
TODAY...BUT WILL WATCH RADAR TRENDS OVER THE NEXT 1 TO 2 HOURS.
MIGHT NEED TO LOWER RAIN CHANCES SLIGHTLY ACROSS THE SRN TIER...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PATTERN DOES NOT SHOW MUCH
CHANGE FROM YESTERDAY THROUGH TONIGHT WITH A DEEP UPPER LOW OVER
SOUTHERN CANADA AND WEAK COLD FRONT EXTENDING OUT OF IT AND
WRAPPING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. HIGH PRESSURE IS STILL
ANCHORED OVER THE SOUTHEAST AND SOUTH CENTRAL STATES. SOUTHWEST
FLOW SOUTH OF THE FRONT AND HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES TO
TRIGGER MORE ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS TODAY...DECREASING
TONIGHT. MCS ACTIVITY MOVING WEST TO EAST ACROSS OK...SOUTHERN MO
AND NORTHERN AR.

ONLY A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS MOVED THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THE LAST
FEW HOURS BUT MODELS SHOW SIGNIFICANT SHORT WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE
KY/TN BORDER AREA THIS MORNING. THIS SHORTWAVE IS REFLECTED ON AREA
RADARS AS AN AREA OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WAS INCREASING IN COVERAGE
AND INTENSITY OVER NORTHERN MIDDLE TENNESSEE AND SOUTHERN MIDDLE
KENTUCKY. THIS AREA COULD BE THE BEGINNINGS OF A NEW MCS EAST OF
THE AR ACTIVITY. THE STORMS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN SECTIONS
OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES AT THIS HOUR
ARE STILL MILD IN THE LOWER 70S WITH EXTENSIVE LOW CLOUD COVER AND
NOT MUCH FOG. EXPECT HIGHEST RAIN CHANCES EARLY IN THE NORTH AS
SHORT WAVE TRACKS EAST BUT EVENTUALLY ALL PARTS OF THE AREA TO HAVE
LIKELY SHOWERS AND A FEW STORMS. A FEW STRONG STORMS POSSIBLE BUT
THE MAIN THREAT TODAY WILL BE LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL. HIGHS TODAY
SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO WEDNESDAY LOWER TO MID 80S WITH MID TO UPPER
70S IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. TONIGHT LOWER POPS TO CHANCE AS
HEATING ENDS...HOWEVER COULD BE AN INCREASE LATE WEST OR NORTH IF
ANY SHORTWAVE GETS GOING LIKE THIS MORNING. LOWS TONIGHT AGAIN NEAR
70 TO LOWER 70S.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ZONAL UPPER FLOW PERSISTS 
OVER THE AREA POSITIONED BETWEEN LARGE VORTEX TO THE NORTH AND HIGH 
PRESSURE TO THE SOUTH. HIGH LAYER MOISTURE CONTINUES INTO THE 
WEEKEND. ON AND OFF CONVECTION INTO THE WEEKEND. LOCALIZED FLOODING 
IS POSSIBLE WITH SLOW MOVING AND TRAINING STORMS. FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
PROGGED TO SHIFT SOUTH INTO THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT. POSITION AND 
SOUTHERN EXTENT REMAIN IN QUESTION AT THIS TIME. NOT OVERLY

NAM SOUNDINGS SHOW PWS RANGING FROM 1.8 TO 2 INCHES WITH ROUGHLY 800 
TO 1500 J/KG OF CAPE. AS MENTIONED IN THE MORNING UPDATE...THESE 
HIGHER PWS PUT US IN THE 75TH TO 90TH PERCENTILE RANGE FOR THIS TIME 
OF YEAR. WARM LAYER CLOUD DEPTHS WILL CONTINUE TO REMAIN WELL ABOVE 
10K FEET THROUGH THE EVENING WHICH IS AN CONDUCIVE ENVIRONMENT FOR 
LOCALIZED POCKETS OF HEAVY RAINFALL DUE TO THE HIGHER PRECIP 
EFFICIENCY OF THE WARM RAIN PROCESS. MODELS INDICATE A DECREASE IN 
ACTIVITY BY AROUND 03Z BUT ONLY FOR A BRIEF PERIOD. TEMPERATURES 
WILL REMAIN A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL TONIGHT AS CLOUD COVER WILL 
PREVENT MUCH RADIATIONAL COOLING.

HIGH PWS AND MODEST CAPE VALUES AGAIN ON THURSDAY WILL GIVE WAY TO 
MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS. MODELS SHOW NEW ACTIVITY BEGINNING TO 
DEVELOP BETWEEN 12Z AND 15Z ON THURSDAY AND CONTINUING THROUGH THE DAY. 
THIS NEW ACTIVITY WILL BE IN RESPONSE TO AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT
THAT STALLS OUT TO OUR WEST. MODELS SHOW THE FRONT STALLING OUT...THUS
KEEPING THE FRONT TO OUR WEST THROUGH THE DAY ON THURSDAY. MAX
TEMPS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN TODAY.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER AIR PATTERN 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL CONTINUE TO BRING UNSETTLED WEATHER FOR 
THE NEXT WEEK. THE NORTHERN EXTENT OF THE UPPER RIDGE WILL PLAGUE US 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND ALONG WITH A PESKY QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. THE BOUNDARY WILL SERVE AS A FOCI FOR SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT NEARLY EVERY DAY. ONE ISSUE MAY BECOME 
HEAVY RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THE BOUNDARY AND INCREASING PW VALUES. 
THE CURRENT HAZ WX OUTLOOK COVERS THESE POSSIBILITIES WELL.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE
WESTERN STATES WITH DEEP LOW NEAR HUDSONS BAY. A WEAK WARM FRONT
STRETCHED FROM JUST SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO MIDDLE AND WEST
TN. AREA RADAR SHOWS WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER MIDDLE AND EAST
TENNESSEE MOVING SLOWLY EAST. MORE CONCENTRATED CONVECTION WAS OVER
NORTHEAST GA. CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES WERE DEVELOPING OVER KANSAS AND
MISSOURI WITH MORE STORMS NOW STARTING TO DEVELOP OVER NW TN. UPPER
FLOW FROM THE WEST AND NW COULD BRING NEXT COMPLEX INTO MIDDLE AND
EAST TN LATER TODAY AND BEFORE THAT CURRENT SHOWER ACTIVITY TO
EXPAND EAST. SLOWLY INCREASE POPS TODAY FROM SW TO NE. DAYTIME HEATING
AND HIGH MOISTURE OF AIR MASS WILL CONTRIBUTE TO SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS AND MAY PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN IN SPOTS AND
STRONG WINDS. TONIGHT GFS SHOWS ANOTHER COMPLEX MOVING INTO KY AND
THEN EAST TN BY 12Z THURSDAY WITH NAM KEEPING ACTIVITY WEST. FOR
NOW EXPECT MORE DIURNALLY ENHANCED CONVECTION BEFORE DECREASING
OVERNIGHT. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS TONIGHT SIMILAR TO LAST FEW
NIGHTS. EXPECT HIGHS TODAY TO BE A COUPLE DEGREES COOLER THAN
TUESDAY WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUDS AND MORE PRECIPITATION. TONIGHT LOWS
IN THE LOWER 70S BUT UPPER 60S NORTH.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN CURRENT 
FORECAST. TN VALLEY IN ZONAL FLOW BETWEEN LARGE LOW TO THE NORTH AND 
SOUTHERN HIGH PRESSURE. LOW LEVEL FLOW REMAINS SOUTHWESTERLY WITH 
PWAT VALUES IN EXCESS OF 2.00 INTO THE WEEKEND. FORECAST SOUNDING 
INDICATE POTENTIAL FOR SLOW MOVING HEAVY RAINSHOWERS IN THE MID 
RANGE FORECAST. CONVECTIVE TIMING FAVORS DIURNAL ACTIVITY BUT 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES POSSIBLE INTO THE NIGHT HOURS WITH WESTERLY 
STEERING. PRECIPITATION CHANCES INCREASING FOR SATURDAY. AIR MASS 
PROGGED TO DRY OUT SOME ON SUNDAY AS WEAK FRONT MOVES SE THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. DIURNAL...OROGRAPHIC CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY CAN 
BE EXPECTED INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL 
ESPECIALLY AT NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...
WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE REMAINED MOVING ACROSS
WEST TN AND NORTH MS AND AL. SCATTERED SHOWERS CONTINUE TO DEVELOP
OVER MIDDLE TN BUT DISSIPATE RATHER QUICKLY ALONG AND EAST OF THE
PLATEAU AS THEY MOVE INTO THE VALLEY. THE 12Z KOHX AND FORECAST
SOUNDINGS OVER OUR FORECAST AREA INDICATE A FAIRLY DEEP DRY LAYER
FROM ABOUT 650MB TO 200MB.

THE HIGH CENTERED OVER THE TX GULF COAST WILL KEEP THE SE US IN
NORTHWEST FLOW. TONIGHT ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS SE
MO...NE AR AND W KY. THIS WAVE WILL GENERATE MORE SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. ANTICIPATE THE THUNDERSTORMS TO MOVE INTO OR NEAR
THE PLATEAU COUNTIES NEAR MIDNIGHT AND MOVE SLOWLY IN A
SOUTHEASTERLY MOTION THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS ESPECIALLY OVER THE
SOUTHERN VALLEY. THE BEST RAIN CHANCES FOR THE ENTIRE AREA WILL
OCCUR AFTER SUNRISE WEDNESDAY.

BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE AREAS OF RAIN SHOULD TAPER OFF BEFORE
MIDNIGHT. TEMPERATURES THROUGH THIS TIME PERIOD WILL BE NEAR NORMAL
OR SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...GENERALLY ZONAL FLOW UPON
THE NORTH SIDE OF A FLAT DIRTY GULF COAST RIDGE. HIGHEST POPS
/LIKELIES/ ATTM SET FOR THURSDAY...AS STEERING SEEMS TO AIM MCS
PATH FROM LOWER OHIO VALLEY INTO OUR AREA...AS SHOWN BEST BY ECMWF
QPF FCSTS AND HPC ACCEPTANCE OF THAT SOLUTION. THE SOUTHERN
SECTIONS OF THE FCST AREA IS THE FAVORED AREA THURSDAY...ALTHOUGH E
TN MTNS MAY LIKEWISE BE IMPACTED BY WEAK UPSLOPE FLOW FROM THE
SOUTH. BEYOND THURSDAY...THE ADVERTISED FRONTAL BOUNDARY FROM THE
NORTH MAY CONTINUE TO BE HUNG UP...AS GFS STRUGGLES TO BRING IT
THROUGH THE AREA...WHILE ECMWF PROVIDES US WITH A FROPA AND SHARPER
UPPER TROUGH BUT NOT UNTIL MAYBE MONDAY. THUS...GIVEN THE MOISTURE
EXPECTED TO BE TRAPPED OVER THE AREA...AND NOT WITHSTANDING ONE OR

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...MOSTLY QUIET WEATHER 
EXPECTED OVER THE SHORT TERM. TONIGHT WILL REMAIN PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY
CLEAR AS DRIER AIR CONTINUES TO FILTER IN ACROSS OUR AREA. THE
ADDITION OF LOWERED DEWPOINTS WILL LEAD TO OVERNIGHT MINS FROM 5 TO 8
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. NORTHWEST FLOW RESUMES ON MONDAY AND PROVIDES
PLEASANT CONDITIONS WITH MAX TEMPS A FEW DEGREES BELOW NORMAL AND
DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 50S NORTH TO LOWER 60S SOUTH. CLOUDS WILL
BEGIN TO INCREASE TOMORROW AFTERNOON AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM. WILL
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVER THE HIGHEST PEAKS OF THE APPALACHIANS
FOR AN ISOLATED AFTERNOON SHOWER OR STORM. A WARM FRONT WILL LIFT
NORTH ACROSS WEST TN ON MONDAY EVENING. THIS FRONT SHOULD STAY TO
OUR SOUTH BUT SHOWERS GENERATED ALONG THE FRONT WILL MOVE FROM
NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST...POSSIBLY IMPACTING PORTIONS OF OUR AREA ON
MONDAY NIGHT. WILL GO WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR LIGHT RAIN
SHOWERS BEGINNING AT 00Z MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 12Z TUESDAY MORNING.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...FOR TUESDAY FAVORED THE NAM 
OVER THE GFS IN TERMS OF POPS. THE NAM WAS MORE IN LINE WITH THE 
SREF IN HAVING LOWEST POPS IN THE VALLEY AND HIGHER POPS ELSEWHERE. 
ALSO TRIED TO TIME THE BETTER RAIN CHANCES TO THE MORNING 
HOURS...HOWEVER LATER HIGHER TERRAIN CONVECTION WILL BE A 
POSSIBILITY. 

BY TUESDAY NIGHT A SHORTWAVE WILL TRANSLATE ACROSS WESTERN/NORTHERN 
KENTUCKY. CONFIDENCE FOR BETTER RAIN CHANCES SLIGHTLY HIGHER FOR 
NORTHWESTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. LACK OF FOCUS FOR 
SOUTHERN AREAS WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES AT A MINIMUM. 

A SLOW MOVING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL SLOWLY ENCROACH E TN/SW VA/SW NC 
WEDNESDAY. THIS BOUNDARY WILL LIKELY SERVE AS A GOOD FOCUS MECHANISM 
FOR NUMEROUS SHOWERS TO DEVELOP ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE AREA 
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. THE PESKY BOUNDARY WILL PROBABLY LINGER 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND. AREAS THAT 
BECOME NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY WILL BE SLIGHTLY COOLER AND DRIER. 

TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD WILL GENERALLY BE AT OR 
SLIGHTLY BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS. PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS OVER THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL REMAIN THROUGH TODAY AND
TONIGHT BEFORE WEAKENING SATURDAY. PWS AND INSTABILITY REMAIN
LIMITED ACROSS MUCH OF AREA TODAY...EXCEPT FOR ATURDAY BEFORE A
COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA FOR SOUTHEAST NORTH CAOLINA. LATEST
STORM MONITOR ANALYSIS PROGRAM AND SPC DATA SHOW MOISTURE/MARGINAL
INSTABILITY POOLING THERE THIS AFTERNOON WITH MLCAPE VALUES NEAR
1000 J/KG. HAVE INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS OVER CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES UNTIL MIDNIGHT.

FOR TONIGHT...PLENTY OF CIRRUS/CIRRUS-STRATUS CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE
TO STREAM INTO THE REGION. ANOTHER ROUND OF PATCHY FOG...SOME
LOCALLY DENSE...IS EXPECTED.

FOR SATURDAY...INCREASING PWS AND MOISTURE IN THE AFTERNOON SO WILL
CONTINUE WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...
MAINLY ALONG THE TERRAIN FEATURES.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL TWO COLD FRONT PASSAGES DURING THE 
SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY TIME FRAMES. IN 
ADDITION...NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL REMAIN OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD...SO THINK THAT 
A FEW ORGANIZED MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEMS ORIGINATING FROM THE 
HIGH PLAINS OR MID MS RIVER VALLEY MAY AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA AT 
TIMES. AS A RESULT...IT APPEARS THERE WILL BE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALMOST EVERY DAY IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT 
ESPECIALLY TOWARDS THE END OF NEXT WEEK AS A COLD FRONT STALLS OUT 
AROUND THE TN RIVER VALLEY WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMING ZONAL. 
AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...WATER VAPOR SHOWS A SHOW-WAVE
MOVING ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY/CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. THIS WAVE
ALONG WITH A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH COMBINED WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY
WITH CAPES BETWEEN 1000-1500 J/KG AND LIFTED INDICES OF -4...
CONTINUES TO PRODUCE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS.
THE CONVECTION IS MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST KENTUCKY. THIS ACTIVITY
WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA THIS EVENING...BUT
WILL DISSIPATE BY AROUND SUNSET. HAVE INCLUDED AN EVENING WORDING
IN THE ZONES TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SCATTERED CONVECTION.

FOR TONIGHT...RIDGING WILL BUILD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH
SKIES BECOMING PARTLY CLOUDY AND WINDS DIMINISHING TO LIGHT/CALM.
PLENTY OF LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE TO INTRODUCE PATCHY FOG...SOME DENSE
FOR FRIDAY MORNING.

FOR FRIDAY...FOG AND LOW-CLOUDS WILL DISSIPATE BY MID-MORNING
GIVING WAY TO PARTLY CLOUDY SKY. PWS DROP BELOW 1 INCH WITH A WEAK
MID-LEVEL INVERSION...SO DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED.

FOLLOWED GFS MOS MINS...BUT UNDER-CUT A DEGREE OR TWO FOR FRIDAYS
HIGH SINCE GUIDANCE HAS BEEN RUNNING TOO WARM FOR MAX TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE BASIC WEATHER 
PATTERN OVER THE U.S. WILL REMAIN STATUS QUO WITH THE TROFS OVER 
EASTERN CANADA AND PAC COAST...WHILE THE UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES 
GENERALLY OVER TEXAS.  THIS KEEPS US IN A RELATIVELY BUSY UPPER 
LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...WITH 
WEAK COLD FRONTS PASSING EVERY FEW OF DAYS.  AT THE END OF THE 
PERIOD THERE IS A HINT THAT THE PATTERN MAY BE WEAKENING AS THE FLOW 
BECOMES MORE ZONAL...AS CANADIAN TROF WEAKENS...ALLOWING THE EDGE OF 
THE RIDGE TO ENCROACH ON THE SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA.

WITH THIS IN MIND AND SEEING THAT MOS MAX TEMPS HAVE BEEN RUNNING 
TOO HIGH...HAVE GONE ABOUT A CATEGORY LOWER THAN MOS MAX TEMPS 
IN GENERAL FOR THESE DAYS.

12Z MEX POPS FOR SUN-MON FOR THE AREA LOOK TOO DRY IN COMPARISON 
WITH 00Z ENSEMBLES AND EURO/CAN QPF PLACEMENTS...ESPECIALLY OVER 
SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA.  SO WILL BUMP UP THOSE POPS.  LOOKING 
RIGHT NOW THAT THE BIGGEST LULL IN PRECIP CHANCES MAY BE CENTERED 
AROUND TUESDAY...SO HAVE LOW POPS ON TUESDAY.  TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
INTO WED...MODELS AGREE ON WARM ADVECTION LIFTING ACROSS THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED 
SURFACE REFLECTION ARE MAKING THERE WAY EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA EARLY THIS MORNING. THERE WILL BE A SMALL CHANCE FOR A SHOWER 
OR TWO MAINLY THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE CWFA WITH THIS FEATURE. 
ANOTHER COOL FRONT IS MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY ATTM 
AND THIS BOUNDARY MAY PROVIDE FOCUS FOR A SHOWER AND POSSIBLY A 
THUNDERSTORM...BUT THE FRONT WILL NOT HAVE THE AVAILABILITY OF DEEP 
MOISTURE WHICH IS DEPARTING WITH THE INITIAL SHORT WAVE SO THE 
CHANCE WILL REMAIN SLIGHT. STAYED IN THE MIDDLE OF GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
FOR MAXES AND MINS IN THE SHORT TERM. PATCHY FOG SHOULD LIFT AROUND 
9 AM OR SHORTLY THEREAFTER.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THERE IS VERY LITTLE CHANGE 
IN THE PATTERN THROUGH THIS PERIOD...WITH A STATIONARY RIDGE OVER TX 
AND A WEAK ATLANTIC TROUGH KEEPING A NW FLOW OVER THE AREA. PRECIP 
CHANCES WILL DEPEND ON UPSTREAM MCS DEVELOPMENT...WHICH ADDS TO THE 
FORECAST UNCERTAINTY AND MODEL DISCREPANCIES. HOWEVER THE GENERAL 
MODEL CONSENSUS IS THAT THE ATLANTIC TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY SLIGHTLY ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...PUSHING A FRONT TOWARD THE AREA. THIS 
APPEARS TO BE THE PERIOD OF HIGHEST PRECIP CHANCES...BUT WILL STILL 
KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE AS MOISTURE APPEARS LIMITED WITHOUT A 
CONNECTION TO THE GULF. THIS FRONT BECOMES PARALLEL TO THE ZONAL NW 
FLOW FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES OF SMALL 
DISTURBANCES THAT MAY OCCUR IN THIS PATTERN...WILL BROAD BRUSH 
CHANCE POPS DURING THE DAY AND SLIGHT CHANCES AT NIGHT. TEMPERATURES

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...WEAK NEARLY STATIONARY FRONT 
WILL REMAIN NEAR OUR SOUTHERN ZONES TONIGHT...THEN A WEAK COLD FRONT 
WILL PUSH THROUGH ON THURSDAY. DEEPER MOISTURE WILL EXIT 
TONIGHT...BUT CONSIDERABLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL LINGER INTO 
THURSDAY.  NOT MUCH INSTABILITY...SO WILL JUST CARRY HIGH CHANCE TO 
LOW LIKELY SHOWERS WITH NO MENTION OF THUNDER TONIGHT.  APPEARS 
INSTABILITY WILL BE A HIGHER FOR THURSDAY...BUT CONVECTION MAY BE 
LIMITED BY DRYING IN THE AFTERNOON.  FOR NOW WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.  WILL JUST MAKE A FEW MINOR TWEAKS TO 
MAV TEMPS...WHICH LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL.    

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT
TO BE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AS NW FLOW ALOFT PATTERN CONTINUES.
TROUGHING IN THE EAST AND RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHWEST WILL CONTINUE 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BEHIND FRONT BUILDS 
SOUTHEAST WITH CLEARING SKIES AND NO CHANCE OF RAIN. LOWS WILL DROP 
BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS TO THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S. FRIDAY HIGH 
PRESSURE WITH DRIER AIR MASS STILL IN CONTROL. THIS WILL PUSH HIGHS 
BACK TO THE MID 80S TO NEAR 90. FRIDAY NIGHT ANOTHER COOLER NIGHT 
WITH THE SURFACE HIGH SHIFTING EAST AND A NEW FRONT MOVING SE INTO 
THE OHIO VALLEY. MODELS DELAYING NEXT FRONT SEVERAL HOURS THAT IS 
MOVING THROUGH THE NW FLOW SO EXPECTING SOME INCREASE IN CLOUDS WITH 
SLIGHTLY WARMER LOWS BUT NO RAIN. SATURDAY SHORTWAVE ENERGY AHEAD OF 
NEXT FRONT TO MOVE IN BY AFTERNOON OR EVENING WITH GOOD CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDER. THIS FRONT LOOKS TO MOVE SOUTH OF PART 
OF THE REGION SUNDAY WITH IMPROVING CONDITIONS NE HALF LATER SUNDAY 
INTO MONDAY BUT THEN MOVE BACK NORTH BY MONDAY EVENING AND BECOME 
NEARLY STATIONARY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY. DAILY 
CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL RETURN MONDAY THROUGH

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOOKS LIKE A SHOWERY PERIOD AS A 
COUPLE SHORT WAVES BUILD THROUGH THE REGION FOLLOWED BY A WEAK COOL 
FRONT LATE TONIGHT. LOW LEVEL AIR MASS STARTS OUT A LITTLE DRY BUT 
MOISTENS UP DURING THE DAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A MOIST ADIABATIC 
PROFILE WHICH WOULD TEND TO LIMIT CONVECTION TO SOME DEGREE. IT 
APPEARS THE LOWEST CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS WOULD BE ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. PRECIP GRADUALLY TAPERS 
TONIGHT AS DEEPEST MOISTURE SLIPS OFF TO THE EAST. CLOUDS AND RAIN 
WILL LIMIT THE DIURNAL RANGE TODAY AND STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER MET MOS TEMPS TODAY AND REDUCED MAV NUMBERS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE GENERAL PATTERN THROUGH 
THE LONG TERM PERIOD WILL FEATURE AN UPPER TROUGH OVER THE ATLANTIC 
COAST...WITH A RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS WILL PLACE THE 
TN VALLEY IN A NW FLOW...WITH A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES PASSING OVER 
THE AREA. 

THURSDAY WILL SEE THE EXIT OF ONE SHORTWAVE TROUGH...WITH BUILDING 
DRY AIR ALOFT AND INCREASING STABILITY. WILL HAVE A CHANCE POP IN 
THE MORNING IN THE EAST TO ACCOUNT FOR TIMING UNCERTAINTIES. FRIDAY 
LOOKS DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY AS A SURFACE HIGH BUILDS OVER THE AREA. 
CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE FOR MCS DEVELOPMENT IN THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS FRIDAY...AND THE REMNANT MCV IS SHOWN BY THE NAM TO AFFECT 
OUR AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY. THE GFS LOOKS SIMILAR BUT IS A 
BIT SLOWER THAN THE NAM. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE GFS AND HAVE HIGH 
CHANCE POPS NORTH AND WEST SATURDAY...SPREADING ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
AREA FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

FOR SUNDAY...MODELS SHOW A FRONT BECOMING PARALLEL TO THE NW FLOW 
ALOFT...AND STALLING SOMEWHERE NEAR THE AREA. THERE ARE SOME MODEL 
DIFFERENCES WITH THE FRONTAL PLACEMENT...WITH THE ECMWF FARTHER 
SOUTH THAN THE GFS...BUT ALL SOLUTIONS WARRANT A CHANCE POP OVER THE 
AREA. A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSAGE ON MONDAY SHOWN BY THE GFS AND 
ECMWF WILL BRING AN ENHANCED CHANCE OF SHOWERS THAT DAY...WITH POPS 
LOWERING TO A SLIGHT CHANCE TUESDAY AS A BIT OF DRYING ALOFT FOLLOWS 
THE TROUGH.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A PLEASANT DAY IS ON TAP FOR LATE JULY...WITH LOW HUMIDITY AND HIGH 
TEMPS 3 TO 5 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. SOME CIRRUS CLOUDS WILL BE OVER 
THE AREA THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY...WHICH WILL HELP MODERATE 
TEMPERATURES A BIT ALONG WITH WEAK 850 MB COLD ADVECTION. AT THE 
SURFACE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED OVER CENTRAL AND EASTERN KY 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...KEEPING DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S. WITH CLEAR AND 
CALM CONDITIONS TONIGHT...LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE MID 50S TO LOWER 
60S. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
THE UPPER FLOW FROM TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY WILL BE CHARACTERIZED
BY NORTHWEST-WEST FLOW WITH A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES MOVING ACROSS
THE GREAT LAKES PULLING COLD FRONTS THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.
THIS UNSEASONABLY PATTERN FOR LATE JULY/EARLY AUGUST WILL KEEP THE
REGION UNDER PERIODS OF CONVECTION AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES.
TUESDAY WILL BEGIN WITH A SURFACR RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY..WHICH WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA TUESDAY
NIGHT/WEDNESDAY. BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW BECOMING SOUTHERLY WEDNESDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY WILL PRODUCE PERIODS OF ISENTROPIC LIFT AND
INCREASING INSTABILITY WITH CAPES OF 2000-2500 J/KG FOR THURSDAY.

A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT BECOMING NEARLY STATIONARY JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA 
FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH HIGH CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
FOR THURSDAY. A BRIEF PERIOD OF DRIER CONDITIONS FRIDAY WILL BE 
FOLLOWED WITH A RETURN CHANCE OF CONVECTION FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY 
AS WINDS BECOME SOUTHERLY PULLING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY BACK INTO 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AHEAD OF ANOTHER FRONTAL BOUNDARY.

AS USUAL FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR...GFS AND ECMWF DISAGREE ON THE 
TIMING AND ASSOCIATED CONVECTION WITH THESE FRONTAL BOUNDARIES.

225 PM EDT SUN JUL 28 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...WITH DRIER AIR (DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S) ON THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BUT NOT QUITE YET IN THE GREAT TN VALLEY. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS (ASSOCIATED WITH 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY) MOVING EASTWARD 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THESE HIGH CLOUDS WILL LIKELY CONTINUE 
MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND MONDAY...AS CONVECTIVE 
ACTIVITY CONTINUES OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND THE UPPER-LEVEL 
FLOW BECOMES ZONAL. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
REVEAL SOME MINOR DISCREPANCIES FOR TONIGHT...BUT ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT ON MONDAY. WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE TWO FOR TONIGHT...WITH LOWS POSSIBLY SETTING DAILY 
RECORDS FOR EVERY LOCATION. THE RECORD LOWS FOR THE 29TH ARE FAIRLY 
WARM (CHA 61...TYS 60...OQT 60...AND TRI 58)...SO IT APPEARS THAT 
SEVERAL RECORDS MAY BE BROKEN ON MONDAY MORNING.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE RIDGING WILL 
REMAIN IN CONTROL THROUGH TUESDAY...ALLOWING FOR MOSTLY DRY 
CONDITIONS. MUCH DRIER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO HANG AROUND FOR MONDAY 
WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. LOW TEMPS WILL STILL BE 5 TO 10 DEGREES 
BELOW AVERAGE ON TUESDAY MORNING BUT STILL A FEW DEGREES TOO WARM 
FOR MOST AREAS TO SEE ANY LOW TEMP RECORDS BROKEN. ONLY THE NORTHERN 
AREAS ARE EXPECTED TO APPROACH RECORD LOW TEMPS. TUESDAY MORNING 
WILL HAVE A FALL-LIKE FEEL TO IT. CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE AGAIN ON 
TUESDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT APPROACHING SYSTEM...WITH CHANCES OF RAIN 
AND A FEW STORMS BY TUESDAY EVENING.

THE PAST FEW MODEL RUNS HAVEN'T BEEN TOO IMPRESSIVE FOR THE MIDWEEK 
SYSTEM. MODELS HAVE BEEN KEEPING THIS SYSTEM AND ITS WARM FRONT 
FURTHER TO OUR WEST...THUS LIMITING THE SEVERE THREAT. CURRENT 
MODELS SHOW LESS INSTABILITY ACROSS OUR AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
THAN PREVIOUSLY INDICATED AS THE WARM FRONT IS OVER WEST TN. I STILL 
EXPECT SOME SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS OUR AREA AS THE SYSTEM 
MOVES EAST...JUST NOT AS STRONG AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT. I BELIEVE THE 
DRIER AIR THAT IS COMING IN TODAY AND MONDAY...ALONG WITH THE 
SURFACE RIDGE...REALLY PREVENTS THE WARM FRONT FROM MAKING IT THIS 
FAR EAST. WILL CONTINUE TO LEAVE SEVERE WORDING OUT OF THE HWO FOR 
NOW.

SHOWERS AND STORMS CONTINUE WED NIGHT AS THE WAVE LOOKS TO BE 
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE 
MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES WILL PULL ANOTHER FRONT INTO 
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR THURSDAY. A RETURN TO A SOUTHWEST FLOW AT 
THE SURFACE ON WED NIGHT AND THUR WILL ALLOW FOR A INSTABILITY TO 
BUILD OUT AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY. CURRENT GFS SHOWING CAPES AROUND 
2000 J/KG. TIMING OF THURSDAYS FRONT IS STILL IN QUESTION...SO WILL 
LEAVE POPS WHERE THEY ARE AT FOR NOW. THE FRONT SHOULD BE WELL TO 
OUR EAST ON FRIDAY...MAKING FOR A DRIER DAY COMPARED TO WED AND 
THU...BUT WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN FOR A ISOLATED AFTERNOON 
SHOWERS AND STORMS. GFS AND ECMWF SHOW ANOTHER TROUGH DIVING DOWN 
FOR THE WEEKEND...BRINGING ANOTHER FRONTAL BOUNDARY WITH ANOTHER 
ROUND OF STORMS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A COLD FRONT IS BRINGING SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS THIS MORNING. 
FORCING ALONG THE FRONT IS WEAK AND WV IMAGERY SHOWS DEEP MOISTURE 
HAS MOVED WELL EAST...SO ONLY ISOLATED TO SCATTERED COVERAGE IS 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE MORNING AS THE FRONT PUSHES THROUGH. SHOWERS 
SHOULD END BY THE AFTERNOON AS VERY DRY AIR BUILDS IN ABOVE 800 MB 
AND A CAPPING INVERSION DEVELOPS AT THAT LEVEL. CLEAR SKIES ARE 
EXPECTED BY TONIGHT...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S MAKING FOR A VERY 
PLEASANT NIGHT FOR LATE JULY. LOW TEMPS WILL BE IN THE MID 50S TO 
LOWER 60S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
SURFACE RIDGING WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY.
BESIDES AREAS OF CIRRO-STRATUS CLOUDS...PLENTY OF SUNSHINE WITH DRY
AIRMASS. SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
WEDENSDAY WITH INCREASING SOUTHERLY FLOW. LATEST MODEL RUNS SHOW
BEST INSTABILITY/CAPES STAYING OVER THE WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY AS
WEAK RIDGING REMAINS ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE. THE WEAK RIDGING WILL
LIMIT CHANCES OF SEVERE STORMS FOR WEDNESDAY...SO PLAN ON TAKING
OUT OF THE HWO.

AN FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES 
WILL PULL ANOTHER FRONT INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR THURSDAY. 
SOUTHWEST WINDS AHEAD OF THE BOUNDARY WILL PULL INSTABILITY BACK 
INTO THE REGION WITH CAPES APPROACHING 2000 J/KG. WOULD GO HIGHER ON 
POPS FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY EVENING...BUT HAVE LOW CONFIDENCE ON 
TIMING OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY. ANOTHER FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES FOR

COLD FRONT OVER THE MID WEST AND LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY... 
STRETCHING FROM NEAR DETROIT SOUTHWEST TO NEAR MEMPHIS. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA...AS AN 
UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
NATION DRIFTS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS EVENING ALONG THE COLD FRONT AS IT 
NEARS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TOWARDS SUNSET...BUT WILL MENTION 
SCATTERED COVERAGE TONIGHT SINCE THE CURRENT PRE-FRONTAL ACTIVITY 
MAY LIMIT ANY ADDITIONAL REDEVELOPMENT ALONG THE FRONT. A FEW POST- 
FRONTAL SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON SUNDAY AS THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
LINGERS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT MAY EVEN GET 
HUNG-UP TEMPORARILY BY THE MOUNTAINS ON SUNDAY...SO WILL KEEP AT 
LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE POP OVER THE MOUNTAINS THROUGHOUT THE DAY. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME MINOR 
DISCREPANCIES FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY...AND WILL GENERALLY TREND 
TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...EXPECT A QUIET SUNDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...THE REST OF THE EXTENDED IS MUCH MORE ACTIVE 
WITH SEVERAL CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

BY SUNDAY NIGHT...THINGS SHOULD BE MUCH IMPROVED AS WE WILL BE UNDER 
THE INFLUENCE OF A DEEP TROUGH WHOSE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL BE 
ON THE LEEWARD SIDE OF THE APPALACHIANS BY THIS TIME. THIS WILL 
ALLOW FOR CLEAR SKIES AS DRIER AIR BUILDS IN. THESE CONDITIONS WILL 
ALLOW FOR UNSEASONABLY COOL AIR...GIVING US A SHOT AT RECORD LOWS ON 
MONDAY MORNING. THE ONLY CAVEAT...LATEST NAM AND GFS SOUNDINGS ARE 
HINTING AT SOME POSSIBLE CLOUD COVER MOVING IN OVERNIGHT SUNDAY INTO 
MONDAY. IF THIS HAPPENS...RECORD LOW TEMPS MAY NOT BE REACHED. AT 
THIS TIME...WILL CONTINUE TO TREND TOWARD MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WITH 
RECORD LOW TEMPS. MONDAY AND MOST OF TUESDAY LOOK TO REMAIN QUIET AS 
HIGH PRESSURE BRIEFLY RETURNS. NEAR RECORD LOWS EXPECTED ACROSS SOME 
AREAS ON TUESDAY MORNING BUT MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN LOCATIONS. 

BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON OUR NEXT SYSTEM IS APPROACHING. MODELS SHOW A 
WARM FRONT LIFTING THROUGH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...THERE IS 
STILL DISAGREEMENT ON THE TIMING AND POSITIONING OF THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. NONETHELESS...LOOK FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS TO MOVE IN 
SOMETIME IN THE TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO WEDNESDAY MORNING TIME-FRAME... 
WITH WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY. THE 
LOCATION OF THE BOUNDARY WILL PLAY A ROLE IN THE SEVERE POTENTIAL... 
STILL TOO MUCH DISAGREEMENT BETWEEN MODELS TO NAIL DOWN EXACT SEVERE 
POTENTIAL. AS OF NOW...STILL GOING WITH THE IDEA THAT A FEW ISOLATED 
SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

THURSDAY CONTINUES TO STAY ACTIVE AS ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH MOVES 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES AND SOUTHERN CANADA. AN ASSOCIATED 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE THROUGH SOMETIME DURING THE DAY...HELPING 
TO GENERATE MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS. WEAK RIDGING RETURNS FOR 
FRIDAY...BUT MODELS SHOW ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVING IN FOR THE WEEKEND 
THAT COULD BRING MORE SHOWERS AND STORMS.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY...STRETCHING FROM NEAR INDIANAPOLIS SOUTHWEST TO NEAR LITTLE 
ROCK. AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS MORNING...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY. NAM AND GFS MODELS INDICATE THAT THE LOCAL AIR MASS MAY 
BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON... 
DEEPENING ON THE AMOUNT OF WARMING REALIZED. EXPECT ADDITIONAL

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS OVER WEST TN THIS MORNING WILL BE MOVING 
EAST...BRINGING SHOWERS TO MOST OF THE AREA TODAY...MAINLY IN THE 
LATE MORNING THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. MODEL DEPICTIONS OF LIFT AND 
INSTABILITY ARE NOT PARTICULARLY STRONG OR ORGANIZED THIS THIS 
SYSTEM...BUT CURRENT PRECIP COVERAGE OVER WEST TN THIS MORNING 
SUGGESTS LIKELY POPS ARE WARRANTED. THERE IS GREATER UNCERTAINTY 
ABOUT PRECIP CHANCES TONIGHT...AS THE NAM DEVELOPS CONVECTION ALONG 
THE SURFACE FRONT AND A SECONDARY SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSAGE...WHILE 
THE GFS SHOWS A DRY FROPA TONIGHT. THE NAM SEEMS REASONABLE WITH LOW 
LEVEL CONVERGENCE ZONE ALONG THE FRONT GENERATING THE PRECIP...SO 
WILL HAVE A CHANCE POP THROUGH TONIGHT. LOWER DEWPOINTS WILL BEGIN 
BUILDING INTO THE AREA TONIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A UNSEASONABLY DEEP UPPER TROUGH WILL BE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES
SUNDAY...EXITING MONDAY. A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE BUILDING
INTO THE REGION SUNDAY WITH SHOWERS ENDING ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND
FAR NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA IN THE MORNING.
DRY...UNSEASONABLY LOW DEWPOINTS AND PLENTY OF SUNSHINE CAN BE
EXPECTED DURING THE LATER HALF OF SUNDAY THROUGH MOST OF TUESDAY.

FOR THE LATER HALF OF TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...A FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES WILL LIFT NORTH AS A WARM FRONT WITH 
ISENTROPIC LIFT GETTING ITS ACT TOGETHER...ESPECIALLY FOR WEDNESDAY 
AS FRONT LIFTS NORTH THROUGH THE AREA. A GOOD DEAL OF SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY CAN BE EXPECTED. WOULD GO HIGHER IN POPS IF 
NOT FOR DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GFS AND ECMWRF ON THE EVOLUTION OF THIS 
SYSTEM. INSTABILITY INCREASES OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WEDNESDAY. 
STILL A THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS WEDENSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES AND 
SOUTHERN CANADA FOR THURSDAY. ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE 
INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY. WILL CONTINUE CHANCE OF SHOWER 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE FROPA. WEAK RIDGING FOR FRIDAY...BUT 
BOUNDARY IS DEPICTED TO MOVE BACK NORTH FOR NEXT WEEKEND.

AS FOR TEMPEATURES...GENERALLY WENT A DEGREE OR TWO COOLER THAN GFS 
MOS...BUT FOLLOWED MINS CLOSELY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC 
REGION...WITH LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE SLOWLY WORKING ITS WAY BACK INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA (DEWPOINTS ALREADY NEAR 70 AT KCHA). SATELLITE 
IMAGERY REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY MOVING 
EASTWARD TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...AS AN UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS UPPER TROUGH 
IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY FURTHER OVERNIGHT...AND WILL GRADUALLY PUSH A 
COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS (AND POTENTIALLY MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE ACCORDING TO THE NAM MODEL) WILL DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT. WITH A FAIRLY AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH 
(FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR)...THINK THAT SOME ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS 
WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER THE FORECAST AREA...SO HAVE UPDATED THE 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY. WILL CONTINUE 
TO MENTION LIKELY POPS AREAWIDE ON SATURDAY...WITH PRECIP CHANCES 
SLOWLY DECREASING SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL 
SOME MINOR DISCREPANCIES THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...AND WILL GENERALLY 
TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A COLD 
FRONT MOVING EAST OF OUR AREA SOMETIME ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EARLY 
EVENING. MODELS HINT AT A QUICKER EXIT THAN CURRENT POPS REFLECT... 
THIS IS DUE TO ENSEMBLE MEMBER POPS STILL BEING ON THE HIGHER SIDE. 
ALSO...IT IS NOT UNCOMMON FOR SUMMERTIME COLD FRONTS TO LOSE SOME OF 
THEIR ENERGY AND MOMENTUM AS THEY DROP THIS FAR SOUTH AND TRY AND 
CROSS OVER THE APPALCHIANS. IF SUNDAY'S FRONT GETS SLOWED UP BY THE 
MOUNTAINS AND HAS A SLOWER EXIT...THIS WOULD KEEP SHOWERS AROUND 
LONGER OVER OUR FAR EASTERN AREAS VERSES A QUICKER EXIT RESULTING IN 
A DRIER OUTCOME. FOR NOW...WILL PRETTY MUCH KEEP POPS WHERE THEY AT 
WITH DECREASING CHANCES FROM WEST TO EAST AS THE DAY PROGRESSES AND 
A DROP OF POPS BY 00Z. 

SURFACE RIDGING WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR LATE SUNDAY THROUGH MOST 
OF TUESDAY. THIS WILL KEEP THE TENNESSEE VALLEY MOSTLY DRY AND 
UNSEASONABLY COOL...ESPECIALLY FOR THE OVERNIGHT LOWS. NEAR RECORD 
LOWS ARE POSSIBLE AREA WIDE ON MONDAY MORNING. NEAR RECORD LOWS ARE 
POSSIBLE AGAIN ON TUESDAY MORNING...BUT MAINLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
AREAS.

TUESDAY...MOISTURE BEGINS TO INCREASE AGAIN AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM 
WITH MOST AREAS HAVING CHANCE POPS IN PLACE BY TUESDAY NIGHT. WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...THE GFS SHOWS A WARM FRONT LIFTING NORTH INTO THE 
REGION FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. THE WARM FRONT LIFTING NORTH WILL 
LEAD TO INCREASING INSTABILITY AND CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS. THIS 
COULD POTENTIALLY SETUP A FAIRLY ACTIVE WEDNESDAY DEPENDING ON THE 
LOCATION OF THE FRONT. HOWEVER...SHEAR IS NOT EXPECTED WITH THIS 
SYSTEM AS THE JET IS WELL TO OUR NORTH. THE LACK OF SHEAR WILL 
HELP TO LIMIT THE OVERALL SEVERE POTENTIAL. CURRENT HWO TALKS ABOUT 
THE POTENTIAL OF SEVERE WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY. WILL LEAVE THE HWO AS 
IS FOR NOW...AS THE PREVIOUS WORDING IS STILL IN-LINE WITH CURRENT 
THINKING.

DUE TO UNCERTAINTY ON THE LOCATION OF THE BOUNDARY...CONFIDENCE IS 
LOW ON POPS FOR THE WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY PERIODS. THE FINAL LOCATION 
OF THE BOUNDARY WILL PLAY A LARGE ROLE IN PRECIP COVERAGE. EXPECT 
MORE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE ON FRIDAY AS ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY IS PRESENT TO GENERATE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING 
THE AFTERNOON HOURS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE OH AND TN VALLEY REGION THIS MORNING WILL 
SHIFT EASTWARD THROUGH THE DAY...AND A TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS WILL DROP SOUTHEAST. AS THE HIGH MOVES EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS...A WEAK S-SE FLOW WILL DEVELOP IN WESTERN NC THIS 
AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD HELP INITIATE A FEW SHOWERS AND TSTMS IN SW 
NC AND THE SMOKIES. THE VALLEY SHOULD REMAIN DRY WITH A PRETTY 
STABLE TEMPERATURE PROFILE IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS.

FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS WITH THE APPROACHING TROUGH AND INCREASING 
UPPER DIVERGENCE IN A JET ENTRANCE REGION WILL PROVIDE SOME LIFT 
LATE TONIGHT...MAINLY AFTER 06Z. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES RISE TO 
1.5 TO 1.75 BY 12Z. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS COMING INTO THE PLATEAU 
AND TN VALLEY IN THIS TIME FRAME. INSTABILITY WILL BE LACKING 
OVERNIGHT...SO WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF TSTMS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A FAIRLY STRONG SHORT-WAVE FOR LATE JULY WILL MOVE ACROSS THE A
SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY SATURDAY THROUGH
MONDAY PULLING A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE
SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. MODELS SHOW A UPPER JET MOVING
ACROSS EASTERN OHIO VALLEY PLACING THE AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT
ENTRANCE REGION. THE JET CONFIGURATION WILL HELP ENHANCE THE
FRONTAL-GENETIC FORCING OVER THE AREA. ALSO... ISENTROPIC LIFT
NOTED AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING FRONT FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY
NIGHT. WILL CALL FOR LIKELY POPS FOR SHOWERS AND ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS.

SURFACE RIDING WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FOR LATE SUNDAY THROUGH MOST 
OF TUESDAY KEEPING THE TENNESSEE VALLEY MOSTLY DRY AND UNSEASONABLY 
COOL..ESPECIALLY FOR THE OVERNIGHT LOWS.

FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON POPS SINCE A LOT 
DEPENDS ON HOW FAR NORTH WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY PULLS NORTH. GFS 
SHOWS FRONT PULLING NORTH INTO THE REGION FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY
WITH INCREASING INSTABILITY AND CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS. WEDNESDAY

(CURRENT RECORD AT KTRI FOR JULY 26TH IS 58 SET BACK IN 2003).

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...OVERALL...LITTLE HAS 
CHANGED FROM PREVIOUS DISCUSSION. FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY 
MOISTURE BEGINS TO INCREASE AS WE TRANSITION TO A SOUTHWEST FLOW 
AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. 
MODELS STILL SHOWING THE COLD FRONT ARRIVING BY SATURDAY EVENING. A 
SHORTWAVE OUT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT WILL ENABLE SOME SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP BY SATURDAY MORNING...BUT WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED DURING THE EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT HOURS WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE COLD FRONT. MODELS STILL 
SUPPORTIVE OF A SLOWER FRONTAL PASSAGE...MODELS INDICATE FRONT WILL 
STILL BE DRAPED ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY MORNING. THE FRONT 
SHOULD MOVE OFF TO OUR EAST BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR MOST ARES DURING THE DAY WITH CHANCE ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS. 
DROPPED ALL POPS BY 06Z ON MONDAY. 

MOSTLY ZONAL FLOW RETURNS FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED. MONDAY LOOKS 
PLEASANT AS DRIER AIR FROM PREVIOUS DAYS FRONTAL PASSAGE CONTINUES 
TO SPILL INTO OUR REGION...COMBINED WITH RETURNING SURFACE RIDGE. 
DID LEAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE ERN MTNS MONDAY AFTERNOON FOR 
CONTINUITY AND TO MESH WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS TO OUR EAST. SURFACE 
RIDGE MOVES OFF QUICKLY TO THE EAST TUESDAY AS MOISTURE INCREASES 
AHEAD OF THE NEXT APPROACHING SHORTWAVE. MOISTURE INCREASE ALONG

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH... 
WITH A DRIER AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA (COMPARED TO 
YESTERDAY). SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING...WITH A FEW AREAS OF FOG ON THE PLATEAU 
AND AROUND THE MOUNTAINS. MODELS INDICATE A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS DEVELOPING AROUND THE MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH MAY 
ALLOW FOR SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON APPEARS TO BE ON 
TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE THIS MORNING TO REMOVE ANY MORNING FOG 
WORDING AND TO ADD A MENTION OF ISOLATED CONVECTION AROUND THE 
MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL
CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE
VALLEY WITH PWS DROPPING BELOW 1 INCH. THE DRY AIRMASS WILL ALLOW
FOR MOSTLY CLEAR SKY. HOWEVER...PATCHY FOG CAN BE EXPECTED DUE TO
THE GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS. ALSO...TEMPERATURES
DROPPING INTO THE MIDDLE 50S TO LOWER 60S THURSDAY NIGHT COMBINED
WITH RELATIVELY WARM LAKE TEMPERATURES WILL ALLOW FOR STEAM FOG
DEVELOPMENT. SOME OF THE FOG THURSDAY NIGHT COULD BECOME DENSE AT
AND NEAR AREA LAKES AND STREAMS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE KEEP 
OUR AIRMASS ON THE DRY SIDE FRIDAY...BEFORE MOISTURE CREEPS UPWARDS 
AGAIN FROM FRIDAY NIGHT TRHOUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT SHOULD CREATE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND SOME
THUNDERSTORMS...MOST LIKELY BY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY SUNDAY. 
MODELS ALL SUPPORT A SLOWER FRONTAL PASSAGE...SO NUDGED POPS UP SOME 
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING. FELT POPS SHOULD BE LOWERED 
AS EARLY AS SUNDAY AFTERNOON...SO LOWERED POPS TO SLIGHT CHANCE IN 
FAR WRN AREAS AT THAT TIME...AND DROPPED POPS ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA BY 06Z MONDAY.

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...MONDAY IS LOOKING TO BE A DRY PERIOD WITH 
ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND SURFACE RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE REGION. SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS IN THE ERN MTNS MONDAY AFTERNOON WERE FOR CONTINUITY AND 
TO MESH WITH ADJACENT NWS GRIDS TO OUR EAST. SURFACE RIDGE MOVES OFF 
QUICKLY TO THE EAST TUESDAY AND MOISTURE INCREASES AHEAD OF THE NEXT 
SYSTEM TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. INCREASED POPS TO AROUND 40 
PERCENT FOR WEDNESDAY GIVEN CONSISTENCY AMONGST LONG RANGE MODELS 
AND 25/00Z GFSX MOS. GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO THE SIMILAR 24/12Z

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT ALONG THE NORTHWESTERN BORDER OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...GENERALLY ALONG A NASHVILLE TN TO MIDDLESBORO KY TO 
BLUEFIELD WV LINE. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE 
SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING AHEAD OF IT 
DUE TO THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. ISOLATED CONVECTION SHOULD LINGER 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL SHORTLY AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING... 
WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECTED TONIGHT. ALTHOUGH HIGH TEMPS ON 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WILL NOT CHANGE MUCH BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT... 
THE NOTICEABLY DRIER AIR BEHIND THE FRONT WILL ALLOW FOR COOLER LOW 
TEMPS AT NIGHT. WITH ONLY WEAK INSTABILITY EXPECTED ON THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON AND FRIDAY AFTERNOON...ANY ISOLATED CONVECTION THAT 
MANAGES TO DEVELOP SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN BOTH DUE 
TO THE HIGHER THAN NORMAL GROUND MOISTURE CONTENT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL 
CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON SATURDAY AS SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY SWINGS AROUND THE BASE OF THE TROUGH ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH LATER SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT. A COOL FRONT WILL BUILD 
INTO THE REGION IN THIS PATTERN LATER SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY 
ENHANCING THE PROBABILITY FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THERE IS 
SOME CONCERN THAT THE FRONT WILL MAKE SLOWER PROGRESS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY SO MAINTAINED LOW THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS 
FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST FOR LINGERING SHOWERS ALONG THE 
BOUNDARY. MODELS AGREE THAT A DRIER NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BE IN PLACE 
MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT. THE DRY PERIOD MAY EVEN EXTEND INTO 
TUESDAY BUT MORE SHORT WAVE ENERGY APPEARS ON THE HORIZON ACROSS THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY EARLY ON TUESDAY AND SOME OF THIS ACTION MAY PUSH 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE DAY SO USED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. ACTIVE WEATHER IS BACK IN THE 
FORECAST AGAIN ON WEDNESDAY WITH MODELS INDICATING THE CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS MOIST AIR IS LIFTED IN ADVANCE OF YET 
ANOTHER APPROACHING SHORT WAVE TROUGH.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A MOIST AIRMASS REMAINS ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA WITH PLENTY OF LOW CLOUDS AREA-WIDE. LOW CLOUDS
AND PATCHY FOG WILL LIFT THIS MORNING DUE TO MIXING AHEAD OF AN
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. MODELS SHOW THE FRONT ACROSS SOUTHEAST
KENTUCKY AT 12Z...THEN SLOWLY MOVES INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND
NORTHERN PLATEAU BY NOON. DAYTIME MIXING AHEAD OF FRONT WILL ONLY
ALLOW FOR VERY SLOW SOUTHWARD PROGRESSION OF BOUNDARY...PER SURFACE 
THETA-E AND WIND MODEL FORECAST. BOUNDARY WILL ONLY BE ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN PLATEAU TO TYS TO GREENEVILLE LINE AT 21Z. MODEL SOUNDINGS
DEPICTS ARE MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIRMASS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE
FRONT WITH CAPES OF 2000-2500 J/KG. 

MODEL SOUNDING ANALYSIS SHOW SOME MID-LEVEL DRY AIR WITH MDPI AND
WINDEX VALUES SUPPORTING ISOLATED STRONG/POSSIBLY SEVERE DOWNBURST WINDS.
ALSO...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL ONCE AGAIN BE A CONCERN...
ESPECIALLY SINCE STORM MOTION WILL BE PARALLEL TO THE BOUNDARY...BUT
RUNOFF PROBLEMS WILL BE LOCALIZED.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES SOUTH OF THE AREA THIS EVENING. PATCHY FOG
EXPECTED TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...DRIER AIR FLOWS INTO THE 
REGION ON THURSDAY BEHIND THE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE. FOR NOW I KEPT 
THE SLIGHT CHANCE AFTERNOON POPS FOR THE EASTERN MTNS ALONG THE TN 
AND NC LINE. FRIDAY ALSO LOOKS DRY OVER THE MAJORITY OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...WITH JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN THE AFTERNOON ALONG TN-NC 
LINE AND OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA.

MEDIUM TO LONG RANGE MODELS SEEM FAIRLY CONSISTENT WITH A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHING BY LATE SATURDAY...AND PREVIOUS GRIDS HAVE 40 TO 50 
PERCENT POPS IN ALREADY. THINK IT IS PROBABLY A BIT EARLY TO GO WITH 
LIKELY POPS JUST YET...AS THESE POPS ARE VERY CLOSE TO THE 24/00Z 
GFSX MOS POPS. 

24/00Z GFSX MOS POPS ARE TRENDING DOWN FROM THE 23/12Z GUIDANCE FOR 
SUNDAY...SO I KEPT RAIN CHANCES CLOSE TO CLIMO AND BELOW MOS. 
SOUNDINGS FOR SUNDAY SHOW WARMING ALOFT WITH LIMITED INSTABILITY... 
SO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS MENTIONED FOR THE 
AFTERNOON. KEEPING BULK OF THE AREA DRY FOR SUNDAY NIGHT...MORE IN

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...COLD FRONT STILL NORTH OF THE
OHIO RIVER...AND IS NOW EXPECTED TO WASH THROUGH LATE TONIGHT AND
INTO EARLY WEDNESDAY. WITH THIS TIMING INSTABILITY WILL BE AT A
MINIMUM...SO THE SEVERE THREAT MENTIONED YESTERDAY...NOW HAS FADED.
CONVECTION ALONG FRONT MAY EVEN STRUGGLE TO PRODUCE
SHOWERS...THEREFORE ONLY "CHANCE" POPS ARE MENTIONED IN GENERAL.
LEAVING SOME POPS IN FOR TOMORROW AFTERNOON AS DRIER AIR REALLY
DOES NOT PUSH INTO THE AREA UNTIL THURSDAY. WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE
TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
A COLD FRONT WILL BE LOCATED ACROSS THE SOUTH/SOUTHEASTERN PORTION 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. EXPECT LINGERING SHOWERS FROM THE AFTERNOON TO 
PERSIST INTO THE EARLY EVENING BEFORE DISSIPATING OVERNIGHT. THE 
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL PROVIDE THE MAJORITY OF THE REGION WITH 
DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR. THE EXCEPTION WILL BE WHERE THE FRONT 
GETS HUNG UP IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NC/TN BORDER. THURSDAY 
NIGHT ANY SHOWERS THAT DO DEVELOP SHOULD END RATHER QUICKLY AFTER 
SUNSET AND REMAIN DRY. 

BY FRIDAY ANOTHER CHANCE FOR AFTERNOON SHOWERS WILL OCCUR OVER THE 
MOUNTAINS AND INTO PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. FRIDAY NIGHT A DEEP 
TROUGH EXTENDING FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO LOUISIANA WILL EDGE CLOSER 
TO THE AREA ALONG WITH AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
INCREASE AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM ALONG WITH WEAK WAVES IN THE 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW HAS CAUSED THE MENTION OF CHANCE OF SHOWERS. THE 
CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL INCREASE MORE AS WE GET INTO SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON. ALONG WITH THE RAIN...TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLIGHTLY 
COOLER THAN SEASONAL NORMALS DUE TO EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER AND 
SLIGHTLY HIGHER PRESSURE.

.AVIATION...MVFR TO IFR CONDITIONS BRIEFLY AFFECTING CHA AND TRI TO 
START THIS MORNING. SPOTTY VERY LIGHT SHOWERS MAY PASS NEAR TRI THIS 
MORNING...WHILE SOME STRONGER CONVECTION (TSRA) CONTINUED TO DEVELOP 
FROM SRN MIDDLE TN INTO NRN AL. HOWEVER...TRACK OF THIS ACTIVITY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS AND
LINGERING INSTABILITY THIS MORNING HAVE BEEN GENERATING ISOLATED TO
SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS SE KY TO SW VA AND NE TN. A WEAK COLD
FRONT WAS LOCATED FURTHER NORTH FROM MID MS VALLEY NE TO THE ERN
GREAT LAKES REGION. COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATER
TODAY LOOKS TO BE SCATTERED AT BEST AND POSSIBLY MORE ON THE ORDER
OF ISOLATED AT TIMES...AS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS IS SHOWN TO SLIP SE
OF THE APPALACHIANS BEFORE THIS AFTERNOON. ADJUSTED POP AND WEATHER
GRIDS ACCORDINGLY IN LINE WITH A MOS BLEND AND ADJACENT NWS GRIDS.
CLOUDINESS SEEMS TO FAVOR CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM MOS FOR HIGHS
TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...THE COLD FRONT SAGGING SOUTHWARD INTO THE REGION PLUS
ANY LINGERING INSTABILITY SUPPORTS 40 PERCENT POPS NORTH TO 30
PERCENT SOUTH. LOSS OF HEATING AFTER THE EVENING HOURS...SO DROPPED
DOWN TO SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT. GFS MOS MINS
CLOSELY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL BE 
LOCATED ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHERN PLATEAU WEDNESDAY 
MORNING...THEN MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA INTO THE AFTERNOON. 
SCATTERED/BROKEN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL ACCOMPANY BOUNDARY 
GIVEN MODERATE CAPE VALUES BETWEEN 1500-2000 J/KG. A FEW STRONG 
THUNDERSTORMS LIKELY OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA.

BOUNDARY WILL MOVE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...STALLING JUST EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. FOR THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE IN CONTROL WITH MAIN 
CHANCE OF CONVECTION NEAR THE TENNESSEE/NORTH CAROLINA MOUNTAINS. 

FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO THE WEEKEND...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SHOW A 
SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM IS STILL IN QUESTION SINCE THE 
GFS AND ECMWF SHOW SOME DISAGREEMENT. MODELS DO SHOW ISENTROPIC LIFT 
ALONG AND NORTH OF THE STALLED BOUNDARY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS AS WELL AS DIVERGENCE ALOFT/FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING. 

INSTABILITY IS LIMITED...SO ANTICIPATE MAINLY SHOWERS...EXCEPT 
DURING THE AFTERNOON. INCREASING CLOUDS AND RAIN WILL LOWER 
TEMPERATURES AS WELL. SYSTEM WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA FOR MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...AS HAPPENS QUITE OFTEN...THE 
LARGE OVERNIGHT SHOWERS AND STORMS FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE FADED 
SLOWLY DURING THE DAY TODAY.  RADAR IS A MIX OF LEFT OVER ISOLATED 
SHOWERS FROM THAT COMPLEX AND ISOLATED CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPED 
FROM TODAY'S SURFACE HEATING.  THINK MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY WILL FADE 
WEST TO EAST AS WEAK UPPER LIFT EXITS TO EAST AND WILL FADE WITH 
EVENING COOLING.  RELATIVELY DRY MID AND UPPER LAYERS SHOULD ALLOW 
FOR RADIATIONAL COOLING TONIGHT...AS LOW LEVELS REMAIN VERY MOIST.  
SHOULD SET UP FOR FOG TONIGHT...AND THINKING FOR NORTHERN 2/3 OF 
AREA...DECENT CHANCE FOR DRIZZLE.  THINKING THAT RELATIVELY HIGH 
POPS IN MOS ARE MORE FROM HEAVY/WET DRIZZLE THAT GOT A COUPLE OF 
CLICKS ON THE RAIN GAGE. QPF FORECAST REFLECTS THIS SCENARIO WITH 
ONLY 0.01 TO 0.03 INCH VALUES FORECAST LATE TONIGHT.  THE 
FOG/DRIZZLE SHOULD BE SLOW TO LIFT IN THE MORNING...THEN EXPECTING 
SOME CONVECTION IN THE HEATING OF THE DAY ON TUESDAY. A WEAK COLD 
FRONT WILL BE MOVING TOWARD THE AREA ON TUESDAY FROM THE NORTH.
SHEAR IS ONLY EXPECTED TO BE MARGINAL...BUT THERE SHOULD BE
INCREASING INSTABILITY AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. WOULD THINK THERE IS A
CHANCE OF SEVERE STORMS FOR NW HALF OF AREA...DEPENDING ON TIMING
OF DIURNAL HEATING...COULD BE A LITTLE MORE OR LESS OF THE AREA.
WENT A COUPLE OF DEGREES COOLER ON THE MAX TEMP FOR
TUESDAY...FIGURING THAT THE HEATING WILL BE SLOW-GOING AT FIRST.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...BY TUESDAY NIGHT A 
COLD FRONT WILL BE SITUATED ACROSS KENTUCKY. SHORT RANGE MODELS 
DIFFER ON TIMING OF FROPA BUT THINK HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT.
LATEST SPC SHOWS A SLIGHT RISK OF SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS JUST NORTH 
AND WEST OF EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. ISOLATED STRONG 
STORMS POSSIBLE...BUT FEEL GREATEST THREAT WILL BE ALONG THE FRONT.

FRONT SLOWLY MOVES SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...SO EXPECT HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY SOUTH WITH 
ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH.

RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY PRODUCING MOSTLY DRY CONDITIONS AND LESS 
HUMIDITY. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS SHOW ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE MOVING 
SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. 
INCREASING CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE WEEKEND IS 
EXPECTED. TIMING OF THIS NEXT WAVE IS UNCERTAIN.

POPPING UP AHEAD OF THIS CONVECTION. WENT WITH SOME TEMPOS FOR THIS

GIVES RELATIVELY HIGH POPS...THINKING THAT THERE IS A DECENT CHANCE

LARGE AREA OF SHOWERS/STORMS STILL HEADED TOWARD THE AREA. IT IS
QUITE OFTEN IN THE SUMMER THAT THE WIDESPREAD NIGHTTIME SHOWERS/STORMS
OVER WEST/MIDDLE TN STRUGGLE THE FOLLOWING DAY COMING INTO E TN.
THESE SHOWERS/STORMS DO HAVE SOME WEAK UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT...BUT
CLOUD TOPS HAVE BEEN WARMING AND THE OVERALL RADAR SHOWS WEAKENING
ON THIS LEADING EDGE. SO HAVE SHUFFLED POPS A LITTLE FOR THIS
AFTERNOON...RAISING WEST AND LOWERING EAST...BUT STILL MOST OF THE
AREA IN THE "LIKELY" CATEGORY. ALSO HAVE TAKEN OUT THE MENTION OF
HEAVY RAINS FOR THIS AFTERNOON. FARTHER WEST...WARM ADVECTION
AREA...MOVING FROM W TN INTO MID TN...LOOKS TO BE MUCH BETTER AT
SUSTAINING ITSELF. THIS AREA IS MOVING EAST...BUT THE NORTHERN EDGE
IS SLIDING SLIGHTLY SOUTH...SO IT APPEARS THAT SOUTHERN AREAS OF

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...IN THE MIDST OF A BREAK IN 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EARLY THIS MORNING...SO FORECAST GRIDS 
WERE ADJUSTED IN THE PRE 12Z GRIDS TO REFLECT THIS. SATELLITE PICS 
SHOW A SHORTWAVE MOVING ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION 
AND I THINK THAT THE NAM 12KM MODEL HAS A GOOD HANDLE ON THIS 
FEATURE FOR TODAY. THE 22/00Z RNK/OHX UPPER AIR SOUNDINGS SHOWED 
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PWAT) VALUES ON THE ORDER OF AROUND 1.75 TO 2.05 
INCHES. EXPECTING RATHER WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS TO BE UNDERWAY BY MID TO LATE MORNING ACROSS AT LEAST 
THE WRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. NUDGED POPS UP BY 16Z TO THE 
UPPER END OF LIKELY...AND CONSIDERED CATEGORICAL POPS BRIEFLY.

COORDINATED ON POSSIBLY ISSUING A FLOOD WATCH (FLASH FLOODING)...
BUT THE POCKETS OF HEAVY RAINS OVER THE PAST 24 TO 48 HOURS HAVE 
BEEN QUITE RANDOM AND LOCALIZED. RIVERS ALSO RUNNING WELL BELOW 
FLOOD STAGES AT THIS TIME. THUS...AFTER COORDINATION WITH ADJACENT 
NWS OFFICES...WILL JUST HIGHLIGHT LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS IN FORECAST 
PRODUCTS (ZFP/HWO) FOR NOW. 

MOS POPS ARE RUNNING HIGHER FOR TONIGHT...BUT COVERAGE SHOULD BE ON 
THE DECREASE AFTER 23/00Z TO 23/03Z. INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY FOR 
EASTERN AREAS WITH GOOD CHANCE POPS IN WESTERN AREAS EARLY TONIGHT. 

GIVEN THE EARLY ONSET OF CONVECTION TODAY AND HIGH PWAT VALUES...
WILL UNDERCUT THE GFS MOS MAXES BY A FEW DEGREES AGAIN TODAY. MOS 
MINS FOR TONIGHT CLOSELY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAIN SHORT WAVE WITH UPPER
TROUGH AXIS TO SHIFT EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY TUESDAY WITH
NEXT WEAK FRONT MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY LATE TUESDAY. THIS
NEXT FRONT WILL TRIGGER SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BY
AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING ACROSS THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. SOME STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG ALONG THE PLATEAU
BEFORE WEAKENING MOVING INTO THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. THE WEAK FRONT
WILL MAKE IT SOUTHEAST AS UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS ACROSS THE EASTERN
STATES WEDNESDAY. RIGHT NOW NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO HAVE POPS
LIKELY BUT CHANCE AS NAM AND GFS SUGGEST ALTHOUGH GFS NOT AS
AGGRESSIVE WITH RAIN CHANCES. A LITTLE MORE SUN TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY WHICH WILL WARM TEMPERATURES BACK TO NEAR NORMAL. BY
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY FRONT WILL BE SOUTH OF THE REGION. RESIDUAL
MOISTURE AND HEATING WILL ALLOW MAINLY ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS
OVER SOUTHEAST SECTIONS...MAINLY EASTERN MOUNTAINS. AS MAJOR TROUGH
RESIDES OVER THE EASTERN STATES A NEW DISTURBANCE AND FRONT WILL
MOVE SOUTHEAST IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT AND GIVE THE REGION RENEWED
CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS LATE SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. TEMPERATURES
WILL BE SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL FROM THURSDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ACROSS CENTRAL EAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA.
EXPECT COVERAGE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE DAY AS A SHORTWAVE
APPROACHES. LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN IS THE MAIN THREAT WITH THIS

409 AM EDT SUN JUL 21 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ISOLATED SHOWERS AND STORMS OVER 
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY COUNTIES OF EAST TN HAD NEARLY 
DISSIPATED AT FORECAST PACKAGE ISSUANCE. A MORE CONCENTRATED AREA OF 
CONVECTION OVER NRN MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL KY HAD ALSO WEAKENED 
OVERNIGHT. I ADJUSTED THE PRE 12Z AND MORNING FORECAST GRIDS TO 
REFLECT THIS BRIEF BREAK IN SHOWERS AND STORMS...WITH INCREASING 
RAIN CHANCES BY THE AFTERNOON. 

WEAK COLD FRONT IS STILL WELL TO OUR NORTH PER 07Z SURFACE MAP... 
ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THE FRONT SAGS A BIT SOUTHWARD TODAY 
AND SATELLITE PICS SHOW A DEVELOPING CIRCULATION OVER THE SRN AND 
MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THIS MORNING. THESE FEATURES PLUS THE MOIST 
AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS IN PLACE...EASILY SUPPORT LIKELY POPS FOR LATER 
TODAY AS WELL FOR AT LEAST THE FIRST HALF OF TONIGHT. NUDGED POPS UP 
IN LINE WITH 21/00Z MOS POPS. 

SPOTTY AREAS HAVE SEEN SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS FROM LATE WEEK INTO 
SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT MUCH OF THE AREA HAS SEEN NO RAIN TO LESS THAN 
1/2 INCH. THUS...WILL NOT ISSUE ANY FLOOD WATCHES JUST YET...ALTHOUGH 
RAIN CHANCES REMAIN ABOVE CLIMO RIGHT INTO MID NEXT WEEK.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO
THE NORTH AND GULF MOISTURE BEING ADVECTED INTO THE REGION WILL
KEEP SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
MONDAY AND MONDAY EVENING...DECREASING LATER MONDAY NIGHT. RAINFALL
AMOUNTS COULD BE AROUND AN INCH IN PARTS OF THE REGION. NOT SURE
WHERE HIGHEST TOTALS WILL BE AT THIS TIME BUT LOCALIZED FLOODING
WILL REMAIN POSSIBLE IN SOME LOCATIONS. UPPER TROUGH SETTLES OVER
THE FORECAST AREA AND THEN SHIFTS SLIGHTLY EAST INTO NC BY TUESDAY.
MODELS TRY TO SHIFT BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT TO THE SOUTH AND EAST
TUESDAY SO SLIGHTLY LOWER POPS TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY
SURFACE LOW TO THE NORTH ALONG SLOW MOVING FRONT TO PASS THROUGH
AND INCREASE SHOWERS AND STORMS AGAIN. FRONT FINALLY EXPECTED TO
DROP SOUTH DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. SOME DRYING TO TAKE PLACE LATER
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT SO DROPPED POPS THURSDAY NIGHT. FRIDAY
WEAK HIGH PRESSURE MOVES IN BEHIND FRONT WITH UPPER TROUGH STILL
OVER EASTERN STATES FOR A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY. THIS CHANGE WILL BE
BRIEF AS NEW SURFACE LOW MOVES INTO THE TN VALLEY WITH ANOTHER
FRONT. CHANCE OF PRECIPITATION AGAIN LATE SATURDAY OR SATURDAY
NIGHT. DAY TIME TEMPERATURES WILL BE SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL THROUGH
MOST OF THE EXTENDED BUT NEAR NORMAL AT NIGHT. WILL FOLLOW CLOSE TO
THE WARMER MAV NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED.

NOT LIKELY TO AFFECT TAF SITES. EXPECTING TRI TAF TO FALL TO OR

247 PM EDT SAT JUL 20 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...A COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO
MOVE TOWARDS THE AREA. INSTABILITIES AHEAD OF THIS FRONT WILL CAUSE
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO CONTINUE TO DEVELOP INTO THE EARLY
EVENING. A MIDLEVEL CLOUD DECK MOVING INTO THE AREA WILL KEEP A
WEAK CAP ON THE ENVIRONMENT. ANY STORMS THAT DO FORM THIS AFTERNOON
AND EVENING ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE SEVERE. ISOLATED SHOWERS ARE
POSSIBLE LATE INTO SATURDAY EVENING AS THE COLD FRONT STALLS NORTH
OF THE AREA OVERNIGHT.

A BRIEF BREAK FROM THE PRECIP EARLY SUNDAY MORNING...AND SCATTERED
SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP EARLY IN
THE AFTERNOON ON SUNDAY. INSTABILITIES ARE VERY WEAK...WITH A LOT
OF MOISTURE PRESENT THROUGH THE ATMOSPHERE. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS
LOOK TO BE THE MAIN THREAT...WITH VERY LOW CHANCE FOR ANY SEVERE
STORMS. WINDS COULD BECOME GUSTY AROUND ANY THUNDERSTORM...BUT
OTHERWISE WILL REMAIN LIGHT THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

CLOUD COVER WILL INCREASE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY
TO OVERCAST SKIES EXPECTED. TEMPERATURES WILL HAVE LESS OF A
GRADIENT BETWEEN HIGH AND LOW THAN THE PAST COUPLE OF DAYS...DUE
MAINLY TO THE CLOUD COVER AND MOISTURE ADVECTION FROM THE
SOUTHEAST. HIGH TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES
COOLER THAN HIGH TEMPERATURES THIS PAST WEEK.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS ARE STAYING
CONSISTENT WITH THE MAIN THEMES...WHICH INCLUDE THE BEST CHANCES OF
RAIN EARLY IN THE WEEK INCLUDING MONDAY...THEN A DIMINISHING OF
DAILY CONVECTION BEGINNING WEDNESDAY TO THE SCATTERED VARIETY...
THEN DIMINISHING FURTHER TO THE ISOLATED VARIETY BY THE END OF THE
WEEK. TEMPS WILL PROBABLY WARM DUE TO DECREASED CLOUDINESS DURING
THE SECOND HALF OF NEXT WEEK...BUT ANY NOTABLE RIDGE BUILDING INTO
THE AREA IS NOT ON TAP UNTIL FRIDAY...AND THAT MAY BE A SHORT-LIVED
TRANSIENT RIDGE AS MODELS SUGGEST ANOTHER EAST COAST TROUGH BY THE
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEKEND.

OR SLIGHTLY ABOVE CLIMO FOR POPS AND WITH PERSISTENCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK FLOW ALOFT FOR THE 
EARLY PART OF NEXT WEEK WILL GRADUALLY TRANSITION TO A LITTLE MORE 
DEFINED TROUGH BY MIDWEEK. LOTS OF MOISTURE WILL BE IN PLACE FOR 
DAILY ROUNDS OF DIURNAL CONVECTION. MODELS ARE NOT IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
ABOUT TIMING OF CONVECTION-ORGANIZING DISTURBANCES...BUT GFS 
ENSEMBLES AND ECMWF ENSEMBLES BOTH AGREE ON GOOD CHANCES OF PRECIP 
EACH PERIOD /40-50%/ UNTIL WEDNESDAY...THEN CHANCES DIMINISH TO 
20-30% RANGE FOR THUR AND FRI. IF NOT A SFC FROPA...THEN PROBABLY AN 
H5 TROUGH PASSAGE WILL HELP SCOUR OUT THE ABUNDANCE OF MOISTURE 
LEADING TO THE LESS ACTIVE LATE-WEEK PATTERN.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CLOUDS THINNED OUT OVERNIGHT
BUT FOG HAS BEEN VERY PATCHY AND NOT THAT DENSE SO FAR. AIR MASS
WILL BECOME QUITE UNSTABLE BY LATE MORNING INTO THIS AFTERNOON...BUT
COVERAGE LOOKS TO BE SCATTERED AT BEST. WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCE
POPS FOR ALL BUT SRN VALLEY (CHA) WHERE POPS WERE LOWERED TO SLIGHT
CHANCE. MODEL SOUNDINGS SUGGEST A THREAT OF MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL
WITH DRIER AIR IN THE MID LEVELS AND BELOW CLOUD BASES...SO
DAMAGING WINDS POSSIBLE AGAIN WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS THIS
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. LET RAIN CHANCES FALL TO SLIGHT CHANCE AFTER
MIDNIGHT WITH LOSS OF HEATING...AND WEAK COLD FRONT STILL WELL TO
OUR NW.

PERSISTENCE ON MAX TEMPS TODAY...STAYING BELOW MID 90S GIVEN THE 
WEAKENING OF THE UPPER RIDGE...PLUS HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER CONTENT.
GFS MOS MINS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE
SOUTHEAST RETREATS MORE TO THE SOUTHEAST AS COLD FRONT MOVES DOWN
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY AND
SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT MOVES TO JUST NORTH OF THE REGION SUNDAY
BUT WILL GET HUNG UP AND NOT MOVE THROUGH. THE HIGH OVER THE SOUTHEAST
AND GULF MOVES LITTLE AND THE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW WILL CONTINUE
TO KEEP ABUNDANT MOISTURE OVER THE AREA. RAIN CHANCES SATURDAY
SIMILAR TO TODAY BUT WILL INCREASE SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY.
KEEPING POPS HIGH THROUGH TUESDAY MONDAY AS SHORTWAVES BRING WAVE
AFTER WAVE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE
LIKELY IN THE AFTERNOON AND A CHANCE OVERNIGHT. ANOTHER FRONT
APPROACHES THURSDAY SO STILL HAVE CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE END OF
THE EXTENDED. RAINFALL AMOUNTS SUNDAY AND MONDAY MAY BE HEAVY
ENOUGH FOR LOCALIZED FLOODING LIKE HAS BEEN SEEN THIS PAST WEEK.
A FEW STRONG STORMS MAY PRODUCE DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL ALSO.

.AVIATION...INTENSE HEATING AND A WEAK DISTURBANCE BUILDING WEST IN
THE CIRCULATION AROUND THE MIDWEST HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM LEAD TO THE
DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION. THE GREATEST COVERAGE OF CONVECTION AT THE
CURRENT HOUR IS AROUND TRI WITH SOME THUNDERSTORMS LOITERING IN THE
SMOKYS AND SMOKY FOOTHILLS. WOULD EXPECT PRECIPITATION AROUND TRI
FOR ANOTHER COUPLE HOURS AND SOME SHOWERS COULD BUILD INTO THE
VICINITY OF TYS IN THE NEXT TWO HOURS BEFORE WEAKENING WITH THE
LOSS OF HEATING. FOG LOOKS LIKE A GOOD IDEA AT TRI WHERE THE
HEAVENS OPENED UP FOR A LENGTHY PERIOD. MVFR CONDITIONS WILL LIKELY
DETERIORATE TO IFR AND POSSIBLY LIFR AROUND SUNRISE. THURSDAY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN IS EXPECTED IN THE 
SHORT TERM AS A DEEP RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE 
OHIO AND TN VALLEY REGIONS. CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON WILL DISSIPATE 
AFTER SUNSET WITH NO MID/UPPER LEVEL FORCING FOR LIFT OVERNIGHT. 
PATCHY VALLEY FOG MAY DEVELOP...ESPECIALLY NEAR BODIES OF WATER OR 
LOCATIONS THAT SAW RAIN THIS AFTERNOON. EXPECT MUCH THE SAME 
TOMORROW...WITH AFTERNOON CONVECTION DEVELOPING IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN AND SLOWLY DRIFTING INTO THE VALLEY. WHILE A FEW STORMS MAY 
BECOME STRONG...NO SEVERE STORMS ARE EXPECTED. WILL FOLLOW 
PERSISTENCE FOR TEMPERATURES...WITH LOWS IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 
70S BOTH NIGHTS...AND HIGHS TOMORROW IN THE UPPER 80S LOWER 90S IN 
MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)... 
THE UPPER-RIDGE BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN ON FRIDAY AS IT PUSHES EAST
AND A BROAD LONGWAVE TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION.
THIS WILL DRIVE A SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO VALLEY LATE
FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...AND EVENTUALLY INTO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. MODELS
ARE ALSO INDICATING THE POTENTIAL FOR A PLUME OF GULF MOISTURE TO
PUSH NORTHWARD INTO THE REGION THIS WEEKEND...WHICH COULD LEAD TO
SOME SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCES FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION ON SATURDAY.
THEREAFTER...POPS INCREASE TO LIKELY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY AS
THE FRONT SAGS SOUTH INTO THE AREA. THOUGH NOTHING WIDESPREAD IS
EXPECTED...HIGH INSTABILITY AND SOME MODERATE SHEAR WILL ALLOW FOR
SOME STORM ORGANIZATION AND FOR SOME STORMS TO BECOME STRONG TO
SEVERE...BRINGING THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING WINDS...HAIL AND
ESPECIALLY LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.

THE FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH AND OUT OF THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY...BUT THE SLOW MOVING UPPER-TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL 
ALLOW FOR A FEW SHORTWAVES TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE EARLY 
TO MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL YIELD A REASONABLE CHANCE 
FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION EACH DAY AND SOME COOLER TEMPERATURES IN 
THE MID TO UPPER 80S GIVEN THE ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER EXPECTED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A MOSTLY SUNNY AND WARMER DAY 
SO FAR ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH TEMPERATURES REACHING THE UPPER 
80S TO NEAR 90.  CLOUD COVER IS SCATTERED WITH ONLY A FEW SHOWERS 
JUST BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ACROSS SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. AIR MASS 
IS MODERATELY UNSTABLE TODAY WITH MORE MOISTURE SOUTH AND DRIER 
NORTH. EXPECT MOST OF THE ACTIVITY TO BE SOUTH AND OVER HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS THROUGH EARLY THIS EVENING.

A PERSISTENCE FORECAST TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY FOR TEMPERATURES...WITH 
LOWS TONIGHT LIKE THIS MORNINGS AND HIGHS WEDNESDAY SIMILAR TO 
TODAYS. AIR MASS EVEN MORE UNSTABLE WEDNESDAY WITH NO CAP SOUTH AND 
MORE OF A CAP NORTH. AS THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS WEST THE FORECAST 
AREA WILL BE ALONG THE SOUTHERN SIDE OF THE RIDGE WHERE STRONG 
HEATING...INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE WILL ALLOW SCATTERED MULTI CELL 
STORMS TO DEVELOP WITHIN THE MOIST AND MODERATELY UNSTABLE WARM 
SECTOR AND SPREAD WEST ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER OF THE UPPER RIDGE. 
SOME OF THIS ACTIVITY MIGHT PRODUCE ISOLATED STRONG TO DAMAGING WIND 
GUSTS PER SPC DAY 2 OUTLOOK.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE WEEKEND...AND 
SHOW THE MID-WESTERN HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WEAKENING LATER THIS WEEK 
WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE FORECAST AREA THIS WEEKEND. 
MODELS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE STRENGTH OF AN UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH THIS WEEKEND...WITH THE GFS MODEL INDICATING A DEEPER TROUGH 
WHICH PUSHES THE WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER...THE ECMWF AND CANADIAN MODELS REVEAL A WEAKER 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WHICH DOESN'T PUSH THIS COLD FRONT COMPLETELY 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA EARLY NEXT WEEK. FOR NOW...WILL PLAN TO 
TREND TOWARDS THE WETTER ECMWF AND CANADIAN SOLUTIONS FOR EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...SINCE THIS SCENARIO OF STALLING COLD FRONTS AROUND THE 
MOUNTAINS IS MORE TYPICAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. OVERALL...THE 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION SHOULD SLOWLY INCREASE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY... 
ESPECIALLY AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...WITH THE GFS AND ECMWF 
MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT ORGANIZED CONVECTION WILL BEGIN TO 
AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT. WITH A MODERATELY TO 
HIGHLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS PROGGED TO DEVELOP EACH AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...THINK THAT SOME STORMS COULD BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE WITH 
DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL...ESPECIALLY THIS WEEKEND 
WHEN THE COLD FRONT NEARS THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE

325 AM EDT MON JUL 15 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STRONG UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL BE 
CENTERED TO OUR NORTH AND WILL EXTEND INTO OUR AREA FOR THE SHORT 
TERM. DRYING WILL OCCUR ESPECIALLY NORTH AND CENTRAL.  WILL KEEP 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS CONFINED TO MAINLY SOUTHERN ZONES TODAY WHERE 
INSTABILITY SHOULD BE A BIT HIGHER...OTHERWISE WILL KEEP FORECAST 
PRECIP FREE THROUGH TONIGHT.  SHOULD SEE QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE 
TODAY AND EXPECT TEMPS TO FLIRT WITH 90 ACROSS MUCH OF THE VALLEY.  
JUST A FEW TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS 
FORECAST WITH SOME MINOR TWEAKS. EASTERN U.S. RIDGE BASICALLY HOLDS 
ITS POSITION THROUGH MID WEEK WITH A DEEP EASTERLY FLOW GENERALLY 
LIMITING CONVECTION TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER AND OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. A DOWNSLOPING FLOW WILL KEEP 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION SOMEWHAT LOWER OVER THE GREAT VALLEY 
ESPECIALLY ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE GRADUALLY WEAKENS 
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS HEIGHTS FALL ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES THROUGH 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. INCREASING INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE WILL ALLOW FOR 
A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DURING THIS 
PART OF THE FORECAST. BY SATURDAY A LONG WAVE TROUGH DEEPENS OVER 
THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION WITH EVEN BETTER CHANCES FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF MCS STYLE 
CONVECTION FORMING UPSTREAM ACROSS THE MIDWEST AND DROPPING 
SOUTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. THE UPPER TROUGH 
AMPLIFIES TO SUCH A DEGREE BY SUNDAY THAT A COOL FRONT BUILDS SOUTH 
INTO THE REGION. RAISED POPS TO THE LIKELY CATEGORY FOR THE BIG 
FRONTAL PUSH. FOR TEMPERATURES TRIED TO STAY A LITTLE COOLER THAN 
MEX MOS MAXES WHILE ADJUSTING A LITTLE ABOVE SUGGESTED MINS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...
A SE FLOW ON THE SW SIDE OF A STRONG RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO FEED 
MOISTURE INTO THE AREA TONIGHT. HOWEVER THERE IS LITTLE ORGANIZED 
LIFT...AND SHOWERS ARE DIURNALLY DRIVEN. SO THE CURRENT ACTIVITY 
WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE A FEW HOURS AFTER SUNSET. BY MORNING THE 
STRONG RIDGE WILL BE CENTERED OVER THE UPPER OH RIVER REGION...WHICH 
WILL PUSH THE DEEP MOISTURE TO OUR WEST AND HAVE A STABILIZING 
INFLUENCE OVER MOST OF OUR AREA. SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA LOOK TO 
REMAIN UNDER AN EASTERLY FLOW OFF THE ATLANTIC...SO WILL KEEP A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING THERE. SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE RIDGE AND SOME 
DOWNSLOPE WINDS WILL HELP RAISE TEMPS TOMORROW INTO THE UPPER 80S 
AND LOWER 90S IN MOST SPOTS WITH SCATTERED CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THE END OF 
THE WORK WEEK. TUESDAY LOOKS TO HAVE THE BEST CHANCE FOR DRY 
WEATHER...WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE MOUNTAINS AND THE PLATEAU. MOISTURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE ADVECTED INTO THE AREA THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
EXTENDED...WITH THE CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS INCREASING EACH DAY. 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY HAVE ENOUGH INSTABILITY EACH DAY FOR DIURNAL 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP. THE SOUNDINGS DO NOT LOOK TOO IMPRESSIVE IN 
TERMS OF WIND SHEAR AND INSTABILITY...SO DO NOT EXPECT MUCH SEVERE 
WEATHER WITH THESE STORMS.

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN CANADA WILL PROGRESS EASTWARD WITH A COLD 
FRONT AFFECTING THE AREA FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. MODELS HAVE 
BEEN CONSISTENT WITH WIDESPREAD COVERAGE EACH DAY SO CONFIDENCE 
FAIRLY HIGH WITH THIS SYSTEM. HOWEVER...STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY OF 
WHETHER THE FRONT WILL BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR SEVERE WEATHER. RECENT 
MODEL RUNS SHOW A VERY MOIST PROFILE WITH UNIMPRESSIVE WINDS. WITH 
THIN CAPE AND WEAK SHEAR...DONT EXPECT ANYTHING SEVERE WITH THIS 
SYSTEM AT THIS TIME. 

HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL TRY TO REACH 90...BUT WITH THE AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE AND CLOUD COVER OVER THE NEXT WEEK...DONT EXPECT TOO MANY 
PLACES OTHER THAN THE FAR SOUTHERN AREA TO GET INTO THE 90S. WENT 
SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPERATURES AND SEVERAL 
DEGREES ABOVE GUIDANCE FOR THE LOW TEMPERATURES EACH DAY. WITH THE 
AMOUNT OF MOISTURE RECENTLY RECEIVED...AS WELL AS THE ADDITIONAL 
MOISTURE EACH DAY...NOT LOOKING AT A WIDE RANGE OF TEMPERATURES.

OVER THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...AND WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE WEST.  BAND 
OF DEEPER MOISTURE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA TODAY AND THEN OFF TO 
OUR WEST.  LOOKS LIKE BEST CHANCES FOR CONVECTION WILL BE SOUTH 
TODAY...SO WILL CARRY POPS AS HIGH AS LIKELY FOR SOUTHWEST ZONES.  
LOWER CHANCES FURTHER NORTH ESPECIALLY IN THE VALLEY WHERE DOWNSLOPE 
FLOW SHOULD HELP TO INHIBIT CONVECTION.  ISOLATED SHOWERS OR 
THUNDERSTORMS MAY LINGER INTO EARLY TONIGHT SOUTHERN ZONES...BUT 
OTHERWISE TONIGHT EXPECTED TO BE PRECIP FREE.   WILL MAKE ONLY A FEW 
MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS FOR THE SHORT TERM.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MASSIVE RIDGE CENTERED OVER 
THE MIDWEST WILL BUILD ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. THROUGH THE FIRST 
HALF OF THE WORK WEEK AND THEN WILL GRADUALLY WEAKEN AS IT IS 
SHUNTED SOUTH BY A LONG WAVE TROUGH DROPPING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES 
AND NORTHEASTERN U.S. SUBSIDENCE IN THE RIDGE PATTERN SHOULD 
SUPPRESS CONVECTION ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY WITH JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ON 
THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS AND CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. MODELS CONTINUE TO 
HOLD ONTO A SLIGHTLY HIGHER PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION AREA WIDE ON 
WEDNESDAY BUT WITH EMPHASIS AGAIN OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES 
AS A WEAK PERTURBATION DROPS SOUTH AND SOUTHWEST IN THE CLOCKWISE 
CIRCULATION AROUND THE WEAKENING RIDGE. STAYED THE COURSE WITH A 
GRADUAL INCREASE IN POPS THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY AS THE EASTERN

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...SCATTERED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND 
PLATEAU AREAS. SOME SMALL HAIL MAY BE POSSIBLE BENEATH THE CLOSED 
UPPER LOW...BUT SEVERE HAIL LOOKS UNLIKELY. THE ORIENTATION AND 
MOVEMENT OF THE CELLS SO FAR SUGGESTS SOME POTENTIAL FOR LOCALIZED 
FLOODING WHERE TRAINING OCCURS.

AS THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER KY CONTINUES TO RETROGRADE...WE WILL 
SEE DEEP MOISTURE INCREASING FROM THE ATLANTIC. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
WILL SPREAD CLOUDS INTO SE TN TONIGHT...WITH PW VALUES RISING TO 
AROUND 2 INCHES BY TOMORROW. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE 
THROUGH THE DAY...WITH POPS RISING TO THE LIKELY RANGE IN THE 
AFTERNOON IN SOUTHERN AREAS. CENTRAL AND NORTHERN AREAS HAVE LOWER 
CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND WILL SEE MORE SUN DUE TO DOWNSLOPE EFFECTS 
FROM THE SE FLOW AT 850-700 MB. WARMEST TEMPS WILL LIKELY BE AT TRI 
TOMORROW. THE MAIN CONCERN WILL BE FLOODING CAUSED BY TRAINING CELLS 
PRODUCING HEAVY RAIN. WITH WEAK INSTABILITY AND LACK OF DYNAMIC 
FORCING ALOFT...THE SEVERE THREAT LOOKS LOW. A STRONG RIDGE BUILDING 
IN SUNDAY NIGHT WILL PUSH THE MOISTURE AXIS TO OUR WEST...ENDING 
POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN OVER THE WEEKEND WILL REMAIN OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY THROUGH THURSDAY. MODELS IN SLIGHT DISAGREEMENT THROUGH THE 
WEEK ON TIMING OF PRECIP. WENT WITH GFS AS SEEMS TO BE HANDLING 
SYSTEM A LITTLE BETTER. HAVE LOWERED THE POPS FOR MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY...WITH THE BEST CHANCE FOR ANY PRECIP IN SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA AND FAR SOUTH EASTERN TENNESSEE. MOST OF THE MOISTURE IS 
BEING ADVECTED SOUTH OF THE AREA...SO WILL ONLY SEE LIGHT ISOLATED 
DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER...MOISTURE DOES MOVE IN BEHIND THE HIGH 
PRESSURE...WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED EACH 
AFTERNOON WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. 

THE HIGH PRESSURE THEN LOOKS TO WEAKEN AND A ZONAL FLOW TO TAKE ITS 
PLACE. A FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH FROM THE NORTH EARLY NEXT 
WEEKEND...RAISING PRECIP CHANCES THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY. AS OF 
NOW...WIND PROFILE AND INSTABILITIES DO NOT SUPPORT SEVERE 
WEATHER...BUT WILL HAVE TO KEEP A WATCH AS THE WEEKEND APPROACHES. 
TEMPERATURES WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE THROUGH THE WEEK UNDER THE HIGH 
PRESSURE. NEAR NORMAL HIGHS IN THE UPPER 80S EXPECTED...WITH A FEW 
LOCATIONS MAINLY SOUTH OF KNOXVILLE EXPECTED TO REACH LOW 90S. 
MOISTURE MOVING IN WILL KEEP DEWPOINTS FAIRLY CONSTANT...WITH LOW

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
A MIDLEVEL STABLE LAYER IS EFFECTIVELY CAPPING CONVECTION OVER THE 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON. WHILE A VERY ISOLATED SHOWER MAY BE POSSIBLE IN 
SW VA OR NE TN THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON...WILL NOT CARRY 
ANY POPS AFTER 00Z. SHOWERS AND CU FIELD THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD 
DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET...LEAVING CLEAR SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH SOME 
PATCHY FOG POSSIBLE.

THE UPPER LOW OVER THE UPPER OH VALELY TODAY WILL DRIFT TO THE SW
TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. THIS WILL SHIFT THE COOLER MIDLEVEL TEMPS
MORE OVER OUR AREA...AND WITH DAYTIME HEATING WE SHOULD SEE 850-700
MB LAPSE RATES TOMORROW AFTERNOON ON THE ORDER OF 6.5-7 DEGREES
C/KM. WILL HAVE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE ENTIRE
AREA TOMORROW AFTERNOON...WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE WESTERN
HALF CLOSER TO THE UPPER LOW. WITH THE LOW TO OUR WEST SATURDAY
NIGHT...A DEEP SE MOISTURE FLOW DEVELOPS...WITH PW VALUES RISING TO
1.5-2.0 INCHES. WILL KEEP A LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP
OVERNIGHT...THOUGH SYNOPTIC FORCING AND INSTABILITY WILL BE
LACKING.

LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CURRENTLY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL CONTINUE
TO RETROGRADE AND PROGRESS WESTWARD TOWARDS THE PLAINS. THE FLOW
AROUND THIS LOW WILL BRING MOISTURE INTO THE AREA FROM THE
SOUTHEAST. WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND LIFT FROM UPSLOPE FLOW...THE
BEST CHANCE FOR ANY CONVECTION WILL BE MAINLY IN THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS OF THE SMOKIES AND THE PLATEAU. HIGH PRESSURE CURRENTLY
OVER THE ATLANTIC STATES WILL MOVE BEHIND THIS LOW AND SLOWLY
STRENGTHEN. MONDAY AND TUESDAY WILL REMAIN MOSTLY DRY...WITH
MOISTURE INCREASING TO THE AREA THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.
DO NOT SEE STRONG FORCING OR INSTABILITY TO SUGGEST ANY SEVERE
WEATHER...HOWEVER EXPECT DIURNAL SETUP OF THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY.
TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN NEAR NORMAL THROUGH THE NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LOW WILL DRIFT SOUTH AND 
SOUTHWEST INTO OUR AREA DURING THE PERIOD. SOMEWHAT DRYER AIR WILL 
MOVE INTO THE AREA ON NORTH TO NORTHEAST WINDS TODAY.  DESPITE SOME 
DRYING...STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY...ESPECIALLY GIVEN SOME COOLING ALOFT WITH THE 
APPROACHING UPPER LOW...FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION AT 
LEAST ACROSS NORTH AND MOUNTAIN ZONES. WILL CARRY LOW POPS IN THESE 
AREAS.  WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING TONIGHT EASTERN MOUNTAIN 
ZONES.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A REFRESHINGLY DIFFERENT 
WEATHER PATTERN IS IN STORE THROUGH MUCH OF THIS PORTION OF THE 
FORECAST WHEN COMPARED TO LAST WEEK'S PATTERN. THE EASTERN STATES 
UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL RETROGRADE STEADILY SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE OHIO 
VALLEY EARLY IN THE PERIOD TO THE DESERT SOUTHWEST BY THE END OF THE 
LONG TERM. A MASSIVE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE WILL REPLACE THE DEPARTING 
LOW LEADING TO PROGRESSIVELY WARMER AND DRIER CONDITIONS NEXT WEEK. 
RELATIVELY DEEP MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL BE PRESENT ON SATURDAY 
WITH THE UPPER LOW IN THE VICINITY AND WHILE THE LOW DRIFTS FARTHER 
WEST ON SUNDAY...MODELS KEEP A FLUX OF DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE 
BETWEEN THE TWO PRESSURE SYSTEMS SO MAINTAINED OR EVEN SLIGHTLY 
INCREASED POPS FOR CONVECTION ON SUNDAY. AS THE UPPER LEVEL HIGH 
GRADUALLY BUILDS SOUTH MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...TRIED TO LIMIT 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...FAVORING THE HIGHER TERRAIN ON THE PLATEAU AND ACROSS THE 
APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. MODELS SEEM TO BE OVERDOING POPS TO SOME 
DEGREE DURING THIS PERIOD AS ONE WOULD EXPECT SUBSIDENCE AND THE 
RESULTING WARMING ALOFT TO LIMIT CONVECTION. CONCERNING TEMPERATURES 
BASICALLY STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE THROUGH THE WEEKEND BUT ADJUSTED

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
SHOWERS HAVE BEGUN TO DEVELOP OVER MIDDLE TN AND S-CNTRL KY AHEAD OF 
AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. EXPECT THAT THE COVERAGE OF STORMS WILL 
REMAIN SCATTERED DUE TO THE PRESENCE OF DRY AIR ALOFT. HOWEVER STEEP 
THETA-E LAPSE RATES WILL MEAN A THREAT OF STRONG WIND GUSTS WITH THE 
STORMS. ALTHOUGH THE FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT...CONVECTION WILL LIKELY DISSIPATE AROUND MIDNIGHT WITH 
THE LOSS OF INSTABILITY. EXPECT THAT WITH MIXING BY WINDS NEAR THE 
FRONT AND FALLING SURFACE DEWPOINTS...LOW STRATUS WILL DEVELOP 
RATHER THAN FOG. 

FRIDAY LOOKS LIKE A PLEASANT DAY FOR MID JULY WITH COMFORTABLE 
DEWPOINTS AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPS IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S. 
THE NAM DEVELOPS SOME SHOWERS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS WHERE AN INVERTED 
SURFACE TROUGH LINGERS BEHIND THE FRONT...SO WILL HAVE A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP IN THE SMOKIES AND SW NC TOMORROW AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PERIOD...WE ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A
SMALL TROUGH WITH A WEAK CUT OFF UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTHEAST. MODELS
AGREE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL DRIFT WESTWARD FOR SEVERAL
DAYS...GETTING WELL WEST OF OUR AREA BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. IN THE
WAKE OF THIS SYSTEM UPPER HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AND SHOULD START
TO HEAT UP THE AREA NEXT WEEK. WITH THIS UPPER HIGH TAKING
CONTROL...HAVE TRIMMED BACK POPS OVER THE AREA FOR ALL OF THESE
LATER PERIODS. MODELS DIDNT SHOW THIS CONTROLLING RIDGE LAST
RUN...SO DONT WANT TO JUMP IN AND STRIP ALL POPS OUT OF EXTENEDED
PERIODS...BUT IF THIS SCENARIO INDEED OCCURS...IT WILL LIKELY TURN
DRY NEXT WEEK.

BACK IN THE SHORTER PERIODS...DEEP MOIST FLOW SETTING 
UP...IMMEDIATELY BEHIND UPPER LOW BY SUNDAY.  WILL GO FAIRLY HIGH 
POPS FOR SUNDAY...ALSO MODERATE SELY STEERING FLOW WILL LIKELY BRING 
STORMS OFF APPALACHIANS OUT INTO THE VALLEY SUNDAY.

SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT LOCATED ALONG THE OHIO RIVER.
DEWPOINTS AHEAD OF THE FRONT REMAIN IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S.
ALOFT...THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS VERY DRY AIR ABOVE 650 MB. THE
RUC IS SHOWING SOME CONVECTION DEVELOPING OVER CNTL KY AND MIDDLE
TN THIS AFTERNOON IN A WEAK CONVERGENCE ZONE AHEAD OF THE FRONT. RUC
FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW VERY LITTLE CIN THIS AFTERNOON...WITH CAPE
VALUES IN THE 1500-2000 J/KG RANGE. THE DRY AIR ALOFT RESULTS IN
HIGH DCAPE VALUES AND SURFACE-TO-MIDLEVEL THETA-E DIFFERENCES
AROUND 30 DEGREES. SO WHILE THE DRY AIR ALOFT SHOULD REDUCE
COVERAGE OF STORMS THROUGH ENTRAINMENT COMPARED TO YESTERDAY...ANY
STORMS THAT DEVELOP COULD PRODUCE DAMAGING WIND GUSTS.

THE RUC SHOWS GREATEST INSTABILITY AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE ACROSS
SOUTHERN AREAS THIS AFTERNOON...SO WILL ADJUST POPS UPWARD IN THAT
AREA AND DOWNWARD NORTH SLIGHTLY. EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A GOOD DEAL OF LOW CLOUDS WILL
START THE DAY EARLY THIS MORNING...BUT WILL DISSIPATE BY 15Z. COLD
FRONT...CURRENTLY NEAR THE OHIO RIVER...WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA FOR
THIS AFTERNOON. AIRMASS WILL BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH CAPES
OF 2500 J/KG OR MORE...SO ANTICIPATE SCATTERED TO BROKEN
DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON. MODELS SHOW BEST UPPER
SUPPORT...ASSOCIATED WITH OHIO VALLEY UPPER JET...OVER THE
MOUNTAINS EASTWARD FOR THE DAY.  

WATER VAPOR SHOWS A GOOD DEAL OF MID-LEVEL DRY AIR MOVING INTO THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY. MODELS SOUNDINGS SHOW MID-LEVELS DRYING OUT
SUBSTANTIALLY FOR THIS AFTERNOON SETTING THE STAGE FOR THE
POTENTIAL OF WET MICROBURTS. MODELS ALSO SHOW HIGH MDPI AND WINDEX
VALUES FOR THIS AFTERNOON WITH DELTA K OVER 30.

BESIDES THE POTENTIAL OF DAMAGING WINDS...LOCALIZED HEAVY RAIN LIKELY...
SO POTENTIAL OF LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING. ANOTHER POTENTIAL IS
MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL GIVEN LOWER WBZ VALUES APPROACHING 11KFT.

BY THIS EVENING...STRONG WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA. DRIER AIR WILL
SLOWLY FILTER IN FOR TONIGHT...BUT ENOUGH RESIDUAL MOISTURE TO
INCLUDE PATCHY FOG.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE WEEKEND...AND REVEAL A 
HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
NATION CREATING A CUT-OFF UPPER LOW OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES ON 
FRIDAY. THIS UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO RETROGRADE WESTWARD ACROSS THE

THE TN RIVER VALLEY EARLY NEXT WEEK (ACCORDING TO THE ECMWF MODEL) 
OR POSSIBLY SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY AND OZARKS 
(ACCORDING TO THE GFS MODEL). IN EITHER CASE...IT APPEARS THAT

ECMWF SOLUTION WOULD SUGGEST. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A VERY MOIST AIR MASS WILL BE OVER THE AREA TONIGHT AND 
THURSDAY...UNTIL A COLD FRONT PUSHES INTO THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT. 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...ONGOING SHOWERS WILL BE MOVING 
SLOWLY AND PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. THE MAIN CONCERN WILL BE 
FLASH FLOODING...BUT DO NOT EXPECT WIDESPREAD PROBLEMS WHICH WOULD 
WARRANT A WATCH AT THIS TIME. AN ISOLATED STORM MAY PRODUCE DAMAGING 
WIND GUSTS. 

A MCV FROM EARLIER CONVECTION OVER MO/IL/WRN KY IS NOW TRIGGERING 
DEVELOPMENT OVER CNTL KY...AND IS SHOWN BY THE MODELS TO CROSS THE 
AREA LATER TONIGHT...SO STORMS ARE EXPECTED TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE 
NIGHT. PLENTY OF MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL BE IN PLACE TOMORROW 
AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING FRONT TO CONTINUE LIKELY POPS AREA WIDE. A 
LITTLE HIGHER 0-6 KM SHEAR MAY LEAD TO A BETTER SEVERE POTENTIAL 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON...THOUGH FLOODING POTENTIAL MAY BE LOWER DUE TO
FASTER STORM MOTION. THE FRONT AND THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH AXIS MOVE
THROUGH 03Z- 09Z FRIDAY...WITH MUCH DRIER AIR BUILDING IN. WILL END
ALL POPS BY MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
DRY NORTHERLY FLOW BEHIND THURSDAY/S COLD FRONT WILL BRING IN A 
DRIER...SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR MASS FOR THE WEEKEND.  MINIMAL DIURNALLY 
DRIVEN CONVECTION IS POSSIBLE SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BUT THIS SHOULD 
REMAIN CONFINED TO HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND MAINLY OVER THE SOUTHEAST.  
STRONG HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL U.S. WILL SHIFT A BIT 
NORTHWARD EARLY IN THE WEEK ALLOWING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO RETURN TO 
THE AREA.  REMNANTS OF CHANTAL MAY WILL ADD TO THIS MOISTURE 
INFLUX.  THIS WILL AID DEVELOPMENT OF SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS 
THE AREA MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
THERE IS PLENTY OF MOISTURE OVER THE AREA THIS MORNING WITH
DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S...AND PW VALUES IN THE 1.5-2.0 INCH
RANGE IN THE 12Z REGIONAL SOUNDINGS. SHOWERS HAVE ALREADY BEGUN TO
DEVELOP IN SOME AREAS...AND COVERAGE WILL INCREASE THROUGH THE
AFTERNOON. THERE APPEARS TO BE A GOOD AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY
AVAILABLE...BASED ON THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING AND RUC FORECAST
SOUNDINGS. HOWEVER FORCING MECHANISMS FOR SYNOPTIC LIFT ARE
LACKING...SO CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT WILL DEPEND ON OUTFLOW
BOUNDARIES AND WEAK CONVERGENCE ZONES. WITH LITTLE SHEAR OR
FORCING...EXPECT THAT STORMS THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE SHORT-LIVED
PULSE STORMS...A FEW OF WHICH MAY PRODUCE LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AND
GUSTY WINDS.

THE CURRENT FORECAST OF HIGH CHANCE POPS IN THE VALLEY AND LIKELY
POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU LOOKS REASONABLE. THE TEMPS AND
DEWPOINTS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK SO FAR...SO NO UPDATE WILL BE
NEEDED.

257 AM EDT WED JUL 10 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SERIES OF WEAK WAVES WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS TODAY. ONE SUCH WAVE IS
HELPING TO PRODUCE A GOOD DEAL OF MID-LEVEL CLOUDS OVER THE
NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS MORNING WITH
WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS. THIS WAVE WILL MOVE EAST OF THE AREA BY
SUNRISE. MODELS SHOW ANOTHER WAVE MOVING INTO THE AREA FOR THIS
AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE HIGH PWS AND MODERATE INSTABILITY WITH CAPES
OF 2000-2500 J/KG...I EXPECT SCATTERED TO BROKEN CONVECTION TO
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. GREATEST COVERAGE WILL AGAIN BE OVER THE
TERRAIN FEATURES. BOUYANCY AND PRESENCE OF MID-LEVEL DRY AIR
SUGGEST ISOLATED TO STRONG/SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE WITH THE MAIN
CONCERN BEING DAMAGING WINDS. ALSO...HIGH PWS AND RELATIVELY SLOW
STORM MOTION...COMBINED WITH LOW FFG...ENHANCES THE CONCERN OF
ISOLATED FLASH FLOODING.

FOR TONIGHT...WEAK COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING ACROS THE OHIO RIVER
WITH ASSOCIATED CONVECTION MOVING INTO THE AREA OVERNIGHT...SO
CONTINUED HIGH CHANCE/LIKELY POPS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
MAIN CONCERN OVERNIGHT WILL BE LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING POTENTIAL.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND 
GENERALLY REVEAL AN AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BY THE END OF THE WEEK. IN ADDITION...IT 
APPEARS THAT MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF TROPICAL STORM CHANTAL 
MAY AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS AMPLIFYING UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON 
THURSDAY...WITH A GOOD COVERAGE OF CONVECTION EXPECTED AREAWIDE. 
WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS PROGGED TO DEVELOP...ALONG WITH 
A FAIRLY DECENT UPPER-LEVEL WIND FLOW...IT APPEARS THAT ORGANIZED 
SEVERE TSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON THURSDAY. RIGHT NOW...THE MODELS 
SUGGEST THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE MORNING HOURS...WHICH WOULD LIMIT THE AREAL COVERAGE OF 
ANY SEVERE TSTORMS FOR THURSDAY. A DRIER AIR MASS WILL THEN MOVE 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WITH MINS TEMPS 
EXPECTED TO BE LOWER EACH MORNING BUT MAX TEMPS SHOULD STILL BE 
ABOUT THE SAME AS THE PRE-FRONTAL TEMPS. ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL 
STILL BE POSSIBLE AROUND THE MOUNTAINS ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY... 
WHERE SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP EACH AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
WEAKENING TROPICAL STORM CHANTAL AS IT NEARS THE SOUTHEAST BY EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. THE CANADIAN MODEL KEEPS CHANTAL TOGETHER AS A FAIRLY 
DECENT TROPICAL SYSTEM BRINGING SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS OF MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA EARLY NEXT WEEK...BUT THIS SOLUTION APPEARS 
TO BE AN OUTLIER RIGHT NOW. FOR NOW...WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION ONLY 
A SLIGHT INCREASE IN POPS FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY DUE TO AN INCREASE 
IN MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF CHANTAL. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND 
TOWARDS THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT 
GENERALLY A FEW DEGREES COOLER DUE TO THE ABOVE-NORMAL GROUND 
MOISTURE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...ATMOSPHERE IS A LITTLE MORE 
UNSTABLE THIS AFTERNOON AND YESTERDAY BUT NO MAJOR FOCUS APPARENT SO 
CONVECTION IS FIRING RATHER NICELY ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES AND 
DRIFTING EAST INTO THE VALLEY WITH LIMITED SUCCESS. BELIEVE THIS 
CONVECTION WILL WEAKEN AND DISSIPATE THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. LEFT 
A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN FOR THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD ON THE POSSIBILITY 
OF SOME OF THE MIDWEST CONVECTION ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH BUILDING SOUTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. THE 
WRF TRIES TO DEVELOP AN MCS WHICH DROPS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE LOWER 
OHIO VALLEY TRANSITING MIDDLE SECTIONS OF TENNESSEE TOWARD DAYBREAK. 
NOT REAL CONFIDENT ABOUT THIS SCENARIO BUT SOME CONVECTIVE ELEMENTS 
MAY SURVIVE THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND DRIFT INTO SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND POSSIBLY EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE DURING THE PRE-DAWN HOURS 
WEDNESDAY. LOOKS LIKE A BETTER CHANCE FOR MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE IN PLACE ON WEDNESDAY AS THE WESTERN GREAT 
LAKES LONG WAVE TROUGH AMPLIFIES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF 
THE NATION. MODELS INDICATE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
AIDING THE DEVELOPMENT OF THUNDERSTORMS. WHILE NO WIDESPREAD SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORM OUTBREAK IS IN THE CARDS FOR THE DAYTIME HOURS WEDNESDAY
A FEW STORMS COULD PRODUCE STRONG AND GUSTY WINDS AND SOME SMALL 
HAIL. USED A MOS BLEND FOR MINS AND MAXES.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY

CHANCES IN THE AFTERNOON/EVE. ISOLATED DIURNAL ACTIVITY RETURNS 
SATURDAY...THEN COVERAGE INCREASES TO SCATTERED SUNDAY THROUGH

RESULT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE ONLY MODEST MID-LEVEL LAPSE

SEVERE...ALTHOUGH SOME GUSTY WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL 
STILL BE POSSIBLE. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS

TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WITH TEMPS A DEGREE WARMER TODAY COMPARED TO

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH MOVING 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES WILL PULL A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST 
AREA THURSDAY. AHEAD OF THE FRONT THE AIRMASS WILL BE VERY MOIST AND 
UNSTABLE. PWS WEDNESDAY WILL BE NEAR 2 INCHES WITH CAPES OF 
2000-2500 J/KG. GIVEN CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURES ONLY IN THE LOWER 
80S...SCATTERED TO BROKEN CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP...ESPECIALLY 
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. GREATEST COVERAGE WILL BE ACROSS THE

FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT WILL PULL 
INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. SOUNDINGS SHOW AIRMASS REMAINING MOIST 
AND UNSTABLE WITH CAPES OF 2500 J/KG...BUT SOME MID-LEVEL DRY AIR IS 
ALSO EVIDENT. THE MID-LEVEL MINIMUM THETA-E WILL PROVIDE A BETTER 
ENVIRONMENT FOR WET-DOWNBURSTS. WILL INCLUDE A BETTER CHANCE AND 
COVERAGE OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

FRONT MOVES SLOWLY SOUTH ACROSS THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY 
MORNING...ENDING CHANCES OF CONVECTION OF MOST OF THE AREA...EXCEPT 
FOR THE FAR SOUTH.

FOR THE WEEKEND...MODELS SHOW A WEAK UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO. THE CIRCULATION AROUND THIS TROUGH WILL

ALSO...OF INTEREST IS DEVELOPING TROPICAL SYSTEM CHANTAL. HURRICANE

.DISCUSSION...SHOWERS LINGERED INTO THE EVENING ACROSS THE EXTREME
SOUTHERN SECTIONS. THEY HAVE JUST NOW ABOUT ENDED AND WILL REMOVE
SHOWERS FOR THE REST OF THE NIGHT. A FEW SHOWERS STILL POSSIBLE
ALONG SOUTHERN BORDER ANOTHER HOUR OR SO. FORECAST AREA IS NOW
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF LARGE RIDGE THAT STRETCHES FROM THE ATLANTIC
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES AND ANOTHER CENTER OVER THE SOUTHWEST.
UPPER LOW IS NOW SHIFTING TOWARDS THE NE STATES AS RIDGE ACROSS
SOUTH GETS STRONGER. UPPER FLOW IS MORE NW WITH LEFT OVER CIRRUS
MOVING SOUTH FROM STORMS THAT HAD FORMED OVER THE OHIO VALLEY
EARLIER TODAY. VARIABLE CLOUDS THE REST OF THE NIGHT AND WITH HIGH
MOISTURE CONTENT IN THE AIR FROM RECENT RAINS PATCHY FOG WILL AGAIN
FORM AND PERSIST THROUGH MID MORNING. UPDATE ALREADY SENT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...REMNANT MOISTURE...OROGRAPHIC 
LIFT AND PROXIMITY OF A WEAK UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY OF ALABAMA MAY ALLOW FOR THE CONTINUATION OF A COUPLE SHOWERS 
AND MAYBE EVEN AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE 
AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA DURING THE EVENING. OTHERWISE...THE LOW 
LEVEL THROUGH SURFACE AIRMASS MAY OFFER UP MORE LOW CLOUDS AND FOG  
AS SOAKED GROUND CONDITIONS AID FORMATION AFTER MIDNIGHT. THE MOIST 
LOW LAYER SHOULD BURN OFF BY MID MORNING TUESDAY. THE AIRMASS WILL BE
SLIGHTLY MORE UNSTABLE ON TUESDAY BUT STILL BELIEVE CONVECTION WILL 
FAVOR HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES WITH SOMEWHAT LOWER CHANCES FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THE WILD CARD MAY 
BE THE POSSIBILITY OF HIGHER PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE SOME SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY AND HIGHER MEAN RH MAY CLIP THIS PART OF THE APPALACHIANS ON 
ITS WAY INTO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES. TRIED TO STAY IN THE MIDDLE 
OF WARMER MAV MAX AND COOLER MET TEMPS ON TUESDAY WITH DEWPOINTS 
EDGING SLIGHTLY HIGHER.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UNUSUAL WEATHER LOOKS 
LIKE IT WILL REAPPEAR DURING THE EXTENDED FORECAST PERIOD. WEAK 
TROFFING WILL REMAIN OVER THE EASTERN U.S. THROUGH MIDWEEK...BETWEEN 
THE PLAINS RIDGE AND THE BERMUDA HIGH. SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION 
TUESDAY EVENING AND WEDNESDAY WILL GIVE WAY TO MORE ORGANIZED 
ACTIVITY THURSDAY AS EASTERN TROUGH SHARPENS AND FORCES FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY THROUGH AREA. BEST RAIN CHANCES BEGIN LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND PERSIST THROUGH THURSDAY BEFORE DIMINISHING THURSDAY NIGHT. 
FRIDAY MAY ACTUALLY BE A FAIRLY NICE DAY. BUT THE PATTERN TAKES A 
TURN TOWARD THE UNUSUAL FRIDAY AS THE EAST COAST TROUGH BECOMES 
SHARP ENOUGH TO FORM ANOTHER CUTOFF LOW IN THE SE STATES BY 
SATURDAY. THE PLAINS RIDGE MAY NOSE NORTH OF THE CUTOFF LOW AND 
FORCE IT WESTWARD...BRINGING A SOUTHEASTERLY FETCH INTO OUR AREA. 
THIS FETCH MAY OR MAY NOT BECOME INVOLVED WITH REMAINS OF TS 
CHANTAL...JUST TOO EARLY FOR ANY CERTAINTY...CANADIAN MODEL SUGGESTS 
THE CHANTAL MOISTURE POTENTIAL MORE THAN THE GFS OR EC AT THIS TIME. 
EVEN SO...MAY BE EXPERIENCING ANOTHER SHOWERY WEATHER PATTERN 
BEGINNING LATE WEEKEND INTO MUCH OF NEXT WEEK.

.AVIATION...A NICE TRANSITION TO IMPROVED FLIGHT WEATHER TODAY WITH
A RELATIVELY DRIER AIRMASS IN PLACE AND LIMITED PROBABILITY OF A
SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM AT ANY TERMINAL. IF A SHOWER WERE TO PASS
OVER A PARTICULAR AIRPORT PROBABILITY IS BEST THAT IT WOULD OCCUR
AT CHA BUT LEFT OUT MENTION WITH AFTERNOON RADAR SHOWING SHOWERS
STRUGGLING TO MAINTAIN STRENGTH EVEN ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES
AT THSI TIME ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH

MVFR LIMITATIONS AND POCKETS OF IFR CEILINGS PRESENT. WORST

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A GOOD DEAL OF LOW AND MID-LEVEL CLOUDS REMAINING ACROSS EAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA...BUT SOUNDINGS SHOW MID-
LEVEL CLOUDS MOVING EAST. DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH CLOUDS EXIT AND
RADIATIONAL COOLING DEVELOPS...FOG COULD BECOME DENSE ACROSS THE
REGION THIS MORNING. CURRENTLY HAVE PATCHY FOG...BUT MAY HAVE TO
HIGHTEN FOG WORDING LATER THIS MORNING.

STORM MONITOR SHOWS DRIER AIR ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING WITH
PWS IN THE 1.3-1.4 INCHES AT TRI/TYS AND 1.9 INCHES AT CHA. MODELS
SHOW BEST MOISTURE/INSTABILITY OVER THE SOUTH TODAY WITH A LOW-
LEVEL BOUNDARY NEAR THE GEORGIA/TENNESSEE STATE-LINE...SO GREATEST
CHANCE OF AFTERNOON/EVENING CONVECTION WILL BE ACROSS SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA TODAY.

CONVECTION WILL DIMINISH THIS EVENING WITH AREAS OF FOG LIKELY
DEVELOPING MONDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
AN UPPER-RIDGE WILL BE THE DOMINATE WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK...HELPING TO PROMOTE 
SOME WARMER AND PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS. HOWEVER...MOISTURE 
UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE WILL ALLOW FOR DIURNALLY DRIVEN SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE AREA EACH DAY. WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY...A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND 
PUSH A COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION...THIS WILL PROVIDE AN EVEN BETTER 
CHANCE FOR SOME ORGANIZED THUNDERSTORMS. THUS...HAVE GONE LIKELY 
POPS AREAWIDE DURING THIS TIME PERIOD. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE PAST 
SEVERAL DAYS...THE PRIMARY IMPACTS FROM THESE STORMS WILL CONTINUE 
TO BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT/PWAT 
VALUES PROGGED TO BE IN PLACE. MODELS ARE CONTINUING TO SHOW THIS 
TROUGH DEVELOPING INTO A CUT-OFF LOW THAT DROPS SOUTHWEST INTO THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY THIS WEEKEND. THIS WOULD RESULT IN 
ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES AND COOLER TEMPERATURES FOR FRIDAY INTO THE 
WEEKEND ONCE AGAIN. GIVEN THIS...HAVE UNDERCUT MOS GUIDANCE BY A FEW 
DEGREES AT THE END OF THE PERIOD AND HAVE RAISED POPS TO CHANCE 
DURING THIS TIME PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER LOW MOVING ENE INTO
WRN OHIO THIS AFTERNOON AND CONTINUES TO AFFECT MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA. INITIAL AREA OF MODERATE SHOWERS HAS PUSHED INTO NE
TN AND SW VA...WHILE AIRMASS BEHIND THIS AREA HAS BECOME SLIGHTLY
UNSTABLE. GETTING SCATTERED NEW DEVELOPMENT OVER WRN PARTS OF THE
FLOOD WATCH AREA WITH RAINFALL RATES AS HIGH AS 1/4 TO 1/2 INCH PER
HOUR IN A FEW SPOTS. THOUGHT ABOUT DROPPING THE FLOOD WATCH FOR THE
PLATEAU COUNTIES...BUT BASED ON NEW CONVECTION I OPTED TO CONTINUE
THE WATCH THROUGH 8PM EDT. THUNDER IS A REMOTE POSSIBLITY...SO I
CARRIED A SLIGHT CHANCE THROUGH THE EVENING. DECREASING CHANCES OF
SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT. 

ALL URBAN AND SMALL STREAM FLOOD ADVISORIES WERE ALLOWED TO EXPIRE
WHILE RIVER FLOODING CONTINUES FOR A FEW RIVERS. 

OTHERWISE FOR LATER PERIODS...FLOW ALOFT BECOMES W TO NW AS THE
UPPER LOW LIFTS FURTHER NE. PLENTY OF RESIDUAL MOISTURE FOR DAYTIME
CONVECTION EACH DAY WITH FORECAST GRIDS GENERALLY ON TRACK. MADE A
FEW ADJUSTMENTS AND WENT CLOSE TO MOS POPS AND TEMPS...OTHER THAN
TO UNDERCUT THE AGRESSIVELY WARM GFS MAX TEMPS EACH DAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MORE RAIN IN STORE FOR 
THE REGION AS A SOUTHERLY FLOW GRADUALLY STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF 
ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROUGH. THE TROUGH BUILDS INTO THE NORTHEASTERN 
U.S. WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. KEPT MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR 
CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY AND THEN TWEAKED A BIT HIGHER THROUGH THE 
LIKELY RANGE ON THURSDAY AS THE TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONT SWING 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MAINTAINED JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND BUT MODELS 
ARE POINTING TOWARD THE POSSIBILITY OF A SLIGHTLY MORE ACTIVE PERIOD 
AT THE END OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST AS AN UPPER LOW RETROGRADES 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. THE POSITION OF THE UPPER LOW COULD 
LEAD TO GREATER COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. WILL AWAIT 
LATER MODEL RUNS TO SEE HOW THIS SCENARIO PLAYS OUT. STAYED A LITTLE 
UNDER MOS MAX TEMPS WHILE TWEAKING MINS ABOUT A DEGREE WARMER 
THROUGH THE PERIOD.

OF THE DAY WITH ISOLATED AFTERNOON STORMS. DUE TO SATURATED
GROUND...ANY ADDITIONAL RAINFALL MAY CAUSE PROBLEMS SO WILL
CONTINUE FLOOD WATCH. AS UPPER TROUGH MOVES NORTHEAST OF THE AREA
THIS EVENING...COVERAGE OF SHOWERS WILL DIMINISH...SO WILL ALLOW
WATCH TO EXPIRE.

.LONG TERM /MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY/...
WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH FINALLY EXITING THE REGION INTO THE 
UPPER OHIO VALLEY ON MONDAY AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL BUILD IN FOR 
THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEK. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE ABUNDANT GULF 
MOISTURE PRESENT UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE...DECENT CHANCES FOR 
SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL EXIST EACH DAY...THOUGH MORE 
SUNSHINE AND SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES ARE ALSO EXPECTED. THE 
NEXT UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL DROP A COLD FRONT SOUTH FROM THE 
OHIO VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY...PROVIDING AN EVEN BETTER CHANCE FOR ORGANIZED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS. THUS...HAVE GONE LIKELY POPS AREAWIDE DURING THIS 
TIME PERIOD. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS...THE 
PRIMARY IMPACTS FROM THESE STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT/PWAT VALUES PROGGED TO BE 
IN PLACE. MODELS ARE NOW HINTING AT ANOTHER CUT-OFF LOW DRIFTING 
SOUTH LATE THIS WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND...WHICH COULD RESULT IN 
ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES AND COOLER TEMPERATURES NEXT WEEKEND. GIVEN 
THIS...HAVE UNDERCUT MOS GUIDANCE BY A FEW DEGREES AT THE END OF THE 
PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...UPPER LEVEL LOW CONTINUES TO SPIN ACROSS THE MID MS
VALLEY AND VERY SLOWLY MOVE EAST UP THE OHIO VALLEY. LONG FETCH OF
GULF AND ATLANTIC MOISTURE CONTINUES TO FEED INTO THE FORECAST
AREA. PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES OVER NE TN AND SW VA ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB INTO THE LOWER AND MID 80S WHICH DESTABILIZED
THE ATMOSPHERE AND CAUSED SOME THUNDERSTORMS TO FORM NE OF
KNOXVILLE INTO SW VA. THESE PRODUCED BRIEF GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY
RAINFALL. THE CORRIDOR OF STEADY RAIN SHOWERS WAS STILL OVER
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND HAD ADVANCED INTO
THE EAST CENTRAL TN VALLEY THIS EVENING. IT WAS STARTING TO NARROW
ON THE WESTERN END WHILE MORE ACTIVITY WAS DEVELOPING IN WESTERN
NORTH CAROLINA WITH MORE THUNDERSTORMS MOVING UP THROUGH CENTRAL
AND NE GA. ADJUSTED TEMPERATURES DOWN IN MOST PLACES IN THE RAIN
COOLED AIR MASS AND ADDED ISOLATED THUNDER TO THE NE SECTIONS.
OTHERWISE FORECAST ABOUT THE SAME WITH OCCASIONAL SHOWERS
OVERNIGHT. MOST REPORTS SO FAR THE LAST FEW HOURS HAVE BEEN FOR
NUISANCE FLOODING BUT MAJOR SE RIVERS WERE STILL RISING.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...EASTERN EDGE OF HEAVIER
RAINS HAS ONLY INCHED EASTWARD DURING THE AFTERNOON...SO I SLOWED
DOWN THE ARRIVAL OVER NE TN AND SW VA A BIT MORE. CAN'T ARGUE WITH
THE SHOWERS (SLIGHT CHANCE TSRA) SWINGING ENE OVERNIGHT...BUT NEXT
SHIFT MIGHT HAVE TO MAKE FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS GIVEN THE PERSISTENT
UPPER RIDGE FROM THE ATLANTIC INTO THE CAROLINAS. LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINS SEEM MOST LIKELY TO AFFECT OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES...SE TN AND
SW NC AREAS. 

OTHERWISE...NO CHANGES MADE FOR SUNDAY CONCERNING THE SHOWERS AND
FLOOD WATCH. I DID LOWER POPS SLIGHTLY FROM THE WEST AFTER 06Z
MONDAY IN LINE WITH NEIGHBORS AND LATEST MODEL TRENDS. RESIDUAL
MOISTURE AND REMNANTS OF UPPER LEVEL TROUGH STILL TO OUR W TO NW ON
MONDAY...SO CONTINUED CHANCE POPS (30 TO 50 PERCENT).

MIN TEMPS NEAR PERSISTENCE EACH NIGHT. MOS MAX TEMPS SUNDAY LOOK
VERY UNREALISTIC CONSIDERING HOW COOL RAINY AREAS HAVE BEEN EACH
AFTERNOON. NOT ENOUGH DRYING OUT MONDAY TO REACH THE GFSX MOS MAXES
AND I CHOSE THE MOS BLEND WITH THE COOLER NAM HIGHS. 

MINOR FLOODING STILL EXPECTED ON THE PIGEON AND FRENCH BROAD RIVERS
AND WILL ALSO ISSUE A FLOOD WARNING FOR THE SEQUATCHIE RIVER AT
WHITWELL. SOUTH CHICKAMAUGA CREEK NOW EXPECTED TO GET WITHIN 1 FOOT
OF THE FLOOD STAGE OF 18 FEET BY EARLY MONDAY MORNING. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...PERHAPS THE CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION WILL BE A LITTLE CLOSER TO CLIMATOLOGY FOR EARLY JULY 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WITH A BRIEF PERIOD OF RIDGING AND SUFFICIENT 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY A LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL AMPLIFY AS IT 
SHIFTS INTO THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. IN THIS REGIME 
THERE WILL BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ON THURSDAY AHEAD OF AN 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT THAT WILL BUILD SOUTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT THE FRONT WILL NOT MAKE RAPID PROGRESS 
ACROSS THE REGION AND MAY SLOW DOWN. THEREFORE...HELD ONTO CHANCE 
POPS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL DRY 
OUT AGAIN FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. TRIMMED A FEW DEGREES OFF WARM 
MOS MAX TEMPS THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

MAINLY 0.50 INCH OR LESS FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS...WITH A FEW SPOTS 
AROUND 1 INCH OR SO (NEWFOUND GAP - 1.37...DUNLAP - 0.92 AND SIGNAL

CURRENT RADARS STILL SHOW THE PROLONGED DOWNSLOPE/RAIN SHADOW LOOK 
OVER CENTRAL PARTS OF EAST TN NE INTO SW VA. FORECAST IS ON TRACK... 
BUT IF RADAR TRENDS DON'T PUSH THE RAIN EAST SOON...PLAN TO LOWER 
THE RAIN CHANCES FOR NE TN AND SW VA OR AT LEAST DELAY IT A BIT.
MAX TEMPS MAY BE AFFECTED AGAIN OVER SE TN AND THE PLATEAU...SO 
FORECAST GRIDS PROBABLY WILL NEED SOME ADJUSTMENTS THIS MORNING.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SLOW MOVING UPPER TROUGH ACROSS
THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY
SUNDAY. SOUTHERLY FETCH FROM THE TROPICS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE
PERIOD WITH PWS TONIGHT APPROACHING THE 99TH PERCENTILE (PWS
BETWEEN 2 AND 2.2 INCHES). MODELS SHOW UPPER JET MOVING ACROSS THE
OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEY PLACING THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE
FAVORED RIGHT ENTRACE REGION LATER TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY ENHANCING
FRONT0-GENETIC FORCING OVER THE AREA. THE STRONGEST FRONTO-GENETIC
FORCING WILL BE OVER THE PLATEAU AND WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY.

CONCERNED THAT SHOWERS/STORMS WITH TORRENTIAL RAINS WILL TRAIN OVER
THESE AREAS TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY WITH 3 TO 5 INCHES OF RAINFALL
LIKELY WITH LOCALIZED AREAS OF 6 INCHES+. SINCE UPPER FORCING
REMAINS THROUGH MOST OF SUNDAY...HAVE EXTENDED FFA THROUGH 00Z MONDAY.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY/...
THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL FINALLY BEGIN TO SHIFT OUT OF THE AREA 
AND INTO THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT...ALLOWING A 
SUBTROPICAL RIDGE TO BEGIN TO BUILD BACK INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALCHIANS EARLY NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER...REASONABLE CHANCES FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL EXIST EACH DAY GIVEN THE ABUNDANT 
GULF MOISTURE STILL PRESENT UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE. A GREATER AMOUNT 
OF SUNSHINE THOUGH WILL HELP HIGHS RETURN TO THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN 
MOST LOCATIONS. THIS PATTERN OF SEASONABLE WEATHER WITH DIURNALLY 
DRIVEN CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK UNTIL 
ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH PUSHING THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES WILL DROP A 
FRONT TOWARD THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY...BRINGING WITH 
IT SOME BETTER CHANCES FOR ORGANIZED STORMS AND SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER 
AIR IN ITS WAKE. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS...THE 
PRIMARY IMPACTS FROM THESE STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO BE LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT/PWAT VALUES PROGGED TO BE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...AFTER A BREAK IN THE SHOWERY
WEATHER...ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS WAS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE GULF
COAST STATES. THIS ACTIVITY IS SPREADING NORTH INTO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS WITH A BAND OF HEAVIER SHOWERS TO OUR WEST ACROSS
MIDDLE TN AND TO OUR SE OVER EASTERN GA AND SC. REALLY NOT SEEING
MUCH IF ANY LIGHTNING STRIKES ANYWHERE NEAR THE FORECAST AREA...SO
ONLY WORDED AS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE
EVENING. AN APPARENT SHORTWAVE IN THE FLOW SHOULD SPREAD THE
SHOWERS INTO MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...THE
SYNOPTIC PATTERN STILL HAS DOWNSLOPING INTO THE NRN AND CENTRAL
VALLEYS OF EAST TN AND SW VA...SO PREFERRED TO STAY WITH HIGH
CHANCE POPS AND SCATTERED WORDING IN THOSE AREAS.

CATGORICAL POPS IN WRN AND SRN AREAS SATURDAY TO MAINLY LIKELY POPS
ELSEWHERE. MODEL QPF OVER HIGHER POP AREAS THROUGH MAYBE SUNDAY
NIGHT WILL POSE A THREAT OF FLOODING...AND MODELS MIGHT BE UNDER
DOING THE POTENTIAL RAINFALL OVER WRN NC WHERE PROLONGED UPSLOPE
FLOW IS SUGGESTED. THIS RAINFALL AND RUNOFF INTO NE TN BRINGS A
POSSIBILITY OF ADDITIONAL FLOODING (NOTING RECENT RISES ON THE
PIGEON AND FRENCH BROAD RIVERS). 

AFTER COORDINATION WITH NEARBY NWS OFFICES...OPTED TO EXTEND AND
EXPAND THE FLOOD WATCH OUT TO 12Z SUNDAY FOR NOW. UPDATED FLOOD
WATCH PRODUCT ALREADY ISSUED. THE COUNTIES LEFT OUT HAVE NOT
EXPERIENCED MUCH RAINFALL AT ALL OVER THE PAST FEW DAYS...AND ALSO
HAVE THE LOWEST FORECASTED RAIN AMOUNTS THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...OUR OLD UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE...STUCK BETWEEN THE BERMUDA AND SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES HIGH PRESSURE RIDGES...WILL CONTINUE TO BE THE MAIN WEATHER 
FEATURE DURING THE EARLY PART OF THE EXTENDED...KEEPING GULF 
MOISTURE FLOW OVER THE AREA THROUGH SUNDAY. HOWEVER...THE LOW WILL 
FINALLY SLIDE UP THE NW SIDE OF THE BERMUDA HIGH AS THE SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES HIGH NOSES EASTWARD. THUS...AFTER A WET SUNDAY...TEMPS WILL 
BECOME MORE SEASONABLE AND PRECIP CHANCES WILL DECREASE JUST IN TIME 
FOR THE NEW WORK WEEK. YEAH. EVEN SO THE RIDGING THAT NOSES INTO THE 
AREA...OR ACTUALLY KIND OF PINCHES INTO THE AREA FROM EAST AND 
WEST...WILL REMAIN DIRTY. AND WITH LOTS OF SURFACE MOISTURE IN 
PLACE...EXPECT DIURNAL CONVECTION TO BE POSSIBLE THROUGHOUT THE WEEK. 
BY NEXT FRIDAY IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSING THE 
GREAT LAKES /AND ITS ASSOCIATED FRONTAL BOUNDARY/ WILL SCOUR OUT THE 
REMAINING MOISTURE AND MAYBE PROVIDE A BETTER WEEKEND NEXT WEEKEND. 
HOWEVER...ONE CAVEAT IS THAT AN EASTERLY WAVE BENEATH THE BERMUDA 
HIGH MAY MOVE INTO THE GULF DURING THE LATTER HALF OF NEXT WEEK...SO 
THE LATE WEEK DYNAMICS REMAIN A LITTLE FLUID.

.DISCUSSION...OTHER THAN RISES AGAIN ON THE FRENCH BROAD AND PIGEON 
RIVERS IN COCKE COUNTY...THERE ARE NO FLOOD CONCERNS THIS MORNING. A 
CHECK OF RAINFALL OVER THE PAST 24 HOURS INDICATED MOST SPOTS GOT 
AROUND 1/2 INCH OR LESS. A FEW EXCEPTIONS NOTED WERE 1.50 INCHES AT 
SPRING CITY (RHEA CO)...1.16 INCHES AT LOOKOUT MTN (HAMILTON CO) AND
1.03 INCHES AT ROAN MTN (CARTER CO). 

AREA RADARS THIS MORNING SHOW VERY SPOTTY LIGHT SHOWERS WITH THE 
BULK OF OUR FORECAST AREA JUST UNDER CLOUDY SKIES. 12Z BNA AND RNK 
SOUNDINGS ARE VERY MOIST AND SO SATURATED THAT THE PROSPECTS OF 
THUNDERSTORMS LOOK VERY MINIMAL. NOT EVEN ANY THUNDER NOTED LAST 
NIGHT WITH THE LOW LEVEL JET THAT DEVELOPED...SO I WILL DECREASE 
THE MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS TO A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR THIS AFTERNOON. 

DAYTIME HEATING WILL BRING ABOUT AN INCREASE IN COVERAGE OF SHOWERS
ESPECIALLY WHERE UPSLOPE LOW LEVEL FLOW IS A FACTOR. PLAN TO LOWER 
POPS SLIGHTLY ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES TO HIGH CHANCE... 
SIMILAR TO NRN VALLEY AREAS OF NE TN AND SW VA. 

UPDATED GRIDS AND PRODUCTS TO FOLLOW SHORTLY...AND THE FLOOD WATCH 
REMAINS IN EFFECT WITH SOME ADJUSTMENTS/EXTENSIONS POSSIBLE WITH THE 
AFTERNOON PACKAGE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...PERSISTENT UPPER TROUGH
WILL REMAIN ACROSS MISSOURI/ARKANSAS THROUGH SATURDAY PULLING
ABUNDANT TROPICAL MOISTURE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN
APPALACHAINS. STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL PRODUCE DOWNSLOPING WINDS
INTO THE NORTHERN VALLEY WHICH WILL LIMIT QPF AMOUNTS OVER
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. PLAN ON DROPPING FFA THERE.
MODELS SHOW BEST LOW-LEVEL CONVERGENCE LATER TODAY OVER THE PLATEAU
COUNTIES AND WESTERN VALLEY.

FOR TONIGHT AND ESPECIALLY SATURDAY...MODELS SHOW INCREASING
DIVERGENCE ALOFT AS THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION ENHANCES DIVERENCE
ALOFT OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. GIVEN PWS OVER 2 INCHES..
WHICH IS WELL ABOVE NORMAL..A RETURN OF HEAVY RAINFALL AND
POTENTIAL FLOODING. 

FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST NORTHEAST INTO
THE OHIO VALLEY WITH MODELS SHOWING CONTINUE DIVERENCE ALOFT AND
LOW-LEVEL FORCING TO PRODUCE AREAS OF HEAVY RAINS. I AM CONCERNED
WE MAY SEE A BETTER CHANCE OF FLOODING FROM SATURDAY THROUGH
SUNDAY. WILL HAVE TO WATCH FOR THIS POTENTIAL GIVEN SATURATED
GROUNDS. AN EXTENSION OF THE FFA IS POSSIBLE LATER THIS WEEKEND.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH TO THE WEST OF THE FORECAST AREA THAT WILL 
HAVE PLAGUED THE REGION WITH RAIN THROUGH THE WEEKEND WILL BEGIN TO 
SHIFT BACK TO THE EAST. THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME ELEVATED CHANCES 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS A FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION ON 
MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. IN IT'S WAKE...SUBTROPICAL RIDGING WILL 
BEGIN TO BUILD BACK INTO THE REGION...RESULTING SOME MOSTLY/PARTLY 
SUNNY AND MORE SEASONABLE WEATHER FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK 
AHEAD. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE HIGH AMOUNT OF GULF MOISTURE PRESENT 
BENEATH THIS RIDGE...DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE 
EACH DAY AND EVENING FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. SOME STORMS 
COULD BECOME STRONG GIVEN SOME MODERATE INSTABILITY...BUT THINK THAT 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE THE PRIMARY IMPACT FROM ANY STORM 
THAT DOES DEVELOP GIVEN THE HIGH PWATS IN PLACE. HOWEVER...HIGHS 
SHOULD RETURN TO THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN MOST LOCATIONS BY THE 
MIDDLE TO LATER PART OF THE WEEK.

A BREAK IN THE SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH HAS ALLOWED THE
PIGEON AND FRENCH BROAD RIVERS TO FALL BELOW OR NEAR FLOOD STAGE
ALREADY THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...MODELS AND SATELLITE PICS SHOW
SHORTWAVE ENERGY SWINGING NE OUT OF THE BASE OF THE UPPER LOW TO
OUR WEST. THIS SHORTWAVE WILL BRING AN INCREASE IN CONVECTION
(MOSTLY SHOWERS) BACK INTO THE TN VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS...
ESPECIALLY LATE TONIGHT. THE SAME S-SE LOW LEVEL DOWNSLOPE FLOW FOR
THE CENTRAL AND NRN VALLEY COUNTIES WILL BE UPSLOPE FLOW OVER WRN
NC. MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON ANOTHER SWATH OF MODERATE TO LOCALLY
HEAVY RAINS TO OUR EAST AGAIN...WHICH COULD AFFECT A FEW STREAMS
AND RIVERS OVER NE TN OVERNIGHT. THE INCREASING LOW LEVEL JET WILL
GENERATE ENOUGH LIFT AND ELEVATED INSTABILITY...SO I KEPT A SLIGHT
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL. DON'T SEE A PATTERN FAVORABLE FOR
A MTN WAVE...ALTHO I DID INCLUDE SOME GUSTY WINDS IN THE MTN GROUPS
OVERNIGHT. 

THUS...FOR THIS REASON AND CONTINUITY WITH NWS NEIGHBORS I WILL
CONTINUE THE FLOOD WATCH THROUGH FRIDAY EVENING...WITH THE OPTION
FOR LATER SHIFTS TO EVALUATE THIS AGAIN ON FRIDAY. 

HARD TO TIME AND JUDGE HOW WIDESPREAD CONVECTION WILL BE FROM
FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH A POTENTIAL DECREASE INDICATED BY
FRIDAY NIGHT. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED ON TRACK OVERALL AND
WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS
SLOWLY EAST SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY NIGHT WITH MODELS IN 
AGREEMENT ON RELATIVELY HIGH POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
DURING THIS PERIOD. STAYED WITH LOWER CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION 
MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS RIDGING BRIEFLY ESTABLISHES ITSELF 
ALBEIT WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY FOR SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. BY THURSDAY ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT SHORT 
WAVE AND FRONTAL BOUNDARY BUILD INTO THE REGION SO TWEAKED POPS UP 
AT THE END OF THE EXTENDED. STAYED IN THE MIDDLE OF ECM/MEX MOS

.DISCUSSION...MAIN CONCERNS THIS MORNING ARE MINOR RIVER FLOODING IN 
COCKE COUNTY ON THE FRENCH BROAD AND PIGEON RIVER...BUT THESE RIVERS 
HAVE CRESTED AND ARE ON THE WAY DOWN. HEAVIEST RAIN OVERNIGHT WAS 
AROUND TRI WHERE 1.73 INCHES WAS MEASURED. OTHER NOTABLE AMOUNTS WERE
2.85 INCHES AT ROAN MTN...2.39 INCHES AT JOHNSON CITY...AND 2.10 
INCHES AT ABINGDON VA. 

ELSEWHERE IN THE WATCH AREA RAINFALL WAS NOT THAT HEAVY...PER RADAR 
ESTIMATES AND AVAILABLE RAIN GAGES. WATER VAPOR SATELLITE PICS THIS 
MORNING SHOW THAT THE MAIN AXIS OF DEEP MOISTURE HAS SHIFTED TO OUR 
WEST FROM AL NORTH ACROSS MIDDLE TN. ALSO...THE 12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS 
REVEAL ABOUT 20 KNOTS OF SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW...PROVIDING THE 
DOWNSLOPE EFFECTS AS FORECAST YESTERDAY. WILL LOWER POPS TO A LIKELY 
RANGE ACROSS THE NRN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS...AND ALSO LESSEN THE 
MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS TO ISOLATED OR SLIGHT CHANCE (BASED ON 
MODEL SOUNDINGS).

PLAN TO CONTINUE THE FLOOD WATCH FOR NOW...BUT WILL RE-EVALUATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AFTER VIEWING 12Z MODEL DATA AND SEEING HOW MUCH RAIN 
FALLS ACROSS THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...SHOWERS AND
ISOLATED EMBEDDED TSRA CONTINUE TO STREAM NORTH WITH NO IMMEDIATE
END IN SIGHT THIS AFTERNOON. RAINFALL SO FAR HAS GENERALLY BEEN
LIGHT TO MODERATE...BUT SHOULD INCREASE TONIGHT. THE BEST SWATH OF
LIFT AND RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE PROGGED FOR WRN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA...BUT DOWNSLOPE FLOW IS NOT INDICATED UNTIL THURSDAY MORNING.
THUS...KEPT A MENTION OF HEAVY RAINS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE REGION
TONIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING. TEMPS SHOULD NOT FALL MUCH GIVEN
CURRENT TEMPS AND DEW POINT TEMPS.

LOWERED POPS SLIGHTLY BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND
NRN VALLEY AREAS...DUE TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF S-SE DOWNSLOPE LOW
LEVEL FLOW. NOT SURE IF CLOUDS WILL ACTUALLY BREAK OUT COMPLETELY
BUT LOWER RAIN CHANCES AND CLOSER TO MOS MAX TEMPS FOR THOSE AREAS.  

FOR THURSDAY NIGHT...LOWERED POPS A BIT MORE FOR NE AREAS AND IF
NAM MODEL IS CORRECT...A FURTHER LOWERING OF POPS MAY BE NEEDED.
OTHERWISE...RAINFALL INENSITY IS SHOWN TO DROP OFF AND FLOOD WATCH
MAY BE NEEDED TO ADJUSTED IN AREAL COVERAGE AND DURATION AT THAT
POINT. CURRENT THINKING IS NE TN AND SW VA AREAS COULD BE DROPPED
WITH THE FLOOD WATCH STILL NEEDED FOR SE TN/SW NC AND NRN PLATEAU 
PERHAPS INTO FRIDAY NIGHT OR SATURDAY.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
A VERY PROLONGED PERIOD OF WET WEATHER WILL PERSIST ON FRIDAY AND

PUMPING ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL GULF MOISTURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
FRIDAY. CLOUDY AND RAIN COOLED CONDITIONS WILL OCCUR DURING THE DAY 
FRIDAY. LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY WILL BE IN PLACE HOWEVER ONLY AN 
ISOLATED RUMBLE OF THUNDER WILL OCCUR. 

THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS REMAINS IN PLAY THROUGH AT LEAST SUNDAY NIGHT.

FORECAST GRIDS LOOK GOOD FOR TODAY WITH POPS INCREASING TO HIGH 
LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL THIS AFTERNOON. WILL ALSO MAINTAIN THE CURRENT 
FLOOD WATCH TIMING...ALTHO THE THREAT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS DOES 
LINGER INTO THE WEEKEND. 

LATEST MODELS ARE ADVERTISING A POTENTIAL SHIFT OF THE HEAVIER RAINS 
TO OUR WEST ON THE 4TH OF JULY...BUT STILL THE AXIS WOULD RUN FROM 
SE TN ACROSS MIDDLE TN INTO CENTRAL KY. WILL EVALUATE THE 12Z MODEL 
RUNS BEFORE ANY CHANGES ARE CONSIDERED TO THE FLOOD WATCH.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...BASIC PATTERN REMAINS
UNCHANGED WITH UPPER RIDGE IN THE WEST AND DEEP UPPER TROUGH OVER
THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY AND ATLANTIC RIDGE OFF THE EAST COAST.
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SOME STRONG HAVE OCCURRED
OVERNIGHT ALONG A STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY LYING NORTH TO SOUTH
OVER EAST TN. RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF UP TO ABOUT ONE INCH HAVE
OCCURRED IN PARTS OF SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE OVERNIGHT. IN BRADLEY
COUNTY UP TO ABOUT TWO INCHES FELL AFTER MIDNIGHT. FLASH FLOOD
GUIDANCE VALUES ARE ABOUT 1.5 TO 2.0 INCHES FOR ONE HOUR AND 2 TO 3
INCHES FOR 3 HOURS SO ANY PROLONGED HEAVY RAIN WILL LIKELY CAUSE
FLOODING. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY TODAY
AND TONIGHT BUT MAY SHIFT SLIGHTLY WEST BY EARLY THURSDAY. AS
TEMPERATURES WARM UP LATE THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME MORE NUMEROUS WITH HEAVY RAINFALL
POSSIBLE BY LATE AFTERNOON OR EVENING. NAM MODEL FORECASTS
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES TO REACH 1.75 TO 2.00 INCHES THIS
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. HAVE CONTINUED FLOOD WATCH FOR TONIGHT AND
KEPT IT THROUGH FRIDAY. A FEW STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG DURING THE
AFTERNOON BUT HEAVY RAIN WILL BE THE MAIN THREAT. HIGH TEMPERATURES
STAY COOL TODAY MOSTLY CLOSE TO THE MET GUIDANCE OF MID 70S TO
LOWER 80S. TONIGHT LOWS COOL TO THE MID TO UPPER 60S WITH POPS NEAR
100 PERCENT.

.LONG TERM...(INDEPENDENCE DAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MINOR CHANGES TO
THE FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY. PATTERN REMAINS FAVORABLE FOR GOOD
MOISTURE TRANSPORT FROM TALC AND CLIMAX. UPPER LOW OVER MISSOURI
SHIFTS SLIGHTLY WEST EARLY IN THE PERIOD. SOUTHEASTERLY LOW LEVEL
JET AROUND 35 KTS ACROSS SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS INTO FRIDAY MORNING
WILL LEAD TO SOME DOWNSLOPE FLOW WEST OF THE ROSELINE INTO EXTREME
E TN VALLEY. ALL MODEL QPF DEPICTING MINIMUMS IN EXPECTED RAINFALL
FROM THE LOWER GASMAN UP TO THE TRI CITIES AREA. CONFIDENCE IN RAIN
SHADOW NOT ENOUGH TO REMOVE THESE AREAS FROM FLOOD WATCH. DAMPENING
UPPER LOW BEGINS MOVING NE OVER THE WEEKEND INTO THE OH VALLEY.
THIS DRAWS PEAT VALUES IN EXCESS OF 2.00 IN AN UP VALLEY FLOW
THROUGH THE E TN VALLEY. INCREASED POPS OVER THE WEEKEND WITH
GROWING CONCERN FOR ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAINFALL FROM DEEP CONVECTION.
UPPER LOW TROUGH AXIS MOVES THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS SHOULD LEAD
TO LOWER POPS CHANCES HOWEVER DIURNAL CONVECTION SHOULD BE ABOVE
NORMAL INTO NEXT WEEK. THICKNESS VALUES ARE ALSO ON THE RISE
SUPPORTING TEMPERATURES IN THE 90S FOR SOME AREAS. DID NOT GO THIS
HIGH EXPECTING ABOVE NORMAL STORMS AND CLOUD COVER.

234 PM EDT TUE JUL 2 2013

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER THE MISSOURI BOOTHEEL HAS ONCE AGAIN
TRIGGERED SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS ACTIVITY WILL
CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND
MAY ACTUALLY EXPAND IN COVERAGE LATER TONIGHT AS THE LOW SLOWLY
NAVIGATES WEST AND LIFT/MOISTURE INCREASES. MODELS ARE INDICATING
ADDITIONAL BANDS OF PRECIPITATION DEVELOPING OVER NORTHERN GEORGIA
AND WESTERN NORTH CAROLINA...AND WORKING THEIR WAY INTO THE REGION
LATE TONIGHT. GIVEN THE VERY MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER...LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL IS EXPECTED WITH MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY THAT DOES DEVELOP.
SOME PATCHY FOG WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE GIVEN THE HIGH MOISTURE
CONTENT AND LIGHT WINDS IN THE USUAL PRONE AREAS THAT REMAIN FREE
OF THE HEAVIER SHOWER ACTIVITY. 

SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL FURTHER EXPAND IN COVERAGE/INTENSITY ON
WEDNESDAY AS MOISTURE/LIFT CONTINUES TO RAMP UP. THUS...HAVE GONE
CATEGORICAL POPS AREWIDE FOR THE AFTERNOON AS ALL MODELS ARE IN
AGREEMENT OF THIS. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL AGAIN BE THE PRIMARY
THREAT WITH THIS ACTIVITY WHICH MAY EVENTUALLY LEAD TO FLOODING
CONCERNS HEADING INTO THE INDEPENDENCE DAY HOLIDAY...WHICH WILL BE
ADDRESSED IN THE SECTION BELOW. HAVE GONE BELOW GUIDANCE ON HIGHS
FOR WEDNESDAY GIVEN THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES...
AS MOST AREAS WILL STRUGGLE TO CLIMB MUCH ABOVE 80 DEGREES.

.LONG TERM /INDEPENDENCE DAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
POPS WILL RISE TO CATEGORICAL WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND REMAIN IN THAT 
RANGE THROUGH FRIDAY AS DEEP TROPICAL MOISTURE FEEDS NORTHWARD INTO 
THE AREA BETWEEN A CLOSED LOW IN THE MIDWEST AND A HIGH OFF THE 
ATLANTIC COAST. PW VALUES WILL BE 1.8 TO 2 INCHES...WITH A DEEP WARM 
CLOUD LAYER DEPTH LEADING TO HIGH PRECIP EFFICIENCY. THE POSITION OF 
THE JET ENTRANCE REGION WILL PRODUCE VIGOROUS UPPER DIVERGENCE AND 
MIDLEVEL FRONTOGENESIS FOR LIFT. THERE ARE SOME MODEL DIFFERENCES ON 
THE FINER DETAILS AND QPF AMOUNTS/LOCATIONS. THE NAM HAS A STRONGER 
RIDGE AND PUSHES THE MAX QPF AXIS TO MIDDLE TN AND THE PLATEAU. THIS 
APPEARS TO BE AN OUTLIER AS THE GFS/ECMWF/CMC CENTER THE MAX QPF 
OVER OUR AREA. HOWEVER THE 12Z GFS HAS TRENDED A BIT FARTHER WEST 
FROM PREVIOUS RUNS. AS A RESULT...WILL SHIFT THE MAX QPF AREA 
SLIGHTLY TOWARD THE WESTERN HALF. SOME DOWNSLOPE EFFECTS MAY ALSO 
TRIM A BIT OFF THE QPF AMOUNTS IN THE NORTHEAST. STILL...WE ARE 
LOOKING AT 2 TO 5 INCHES ON AVERAGE ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH 
FRIDAY...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS. FLOODING POTENTIAL APPEARS 
HIGH...SO THE FLOOD WATCH WILL BE MAINTAINED AS IS. 

THE UPPER LOW TO OUR WEST TRANSITIONS TO AN OPEN WAVE TROUGH FRIDAY 
NIGHT...AND THE ATLANTIC RIDGE BEGINS TO EXTEND TO THE WEST. WE WILL 
REMAIN UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THIS RIDGE THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF 
THE FORECAST PERIOD. WHILE MOISTURE DEPTH DECREASES AS THE RIDGE 
BUILDS IN...A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO PROVIDE SOME 
ACCESS TO GULF MOISTURE. SCATTERED TO ISOLATED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MAINLY DIURNAL AND WILL FAVOR THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU. TEMPS WILL RISE ABOVE NORMAL 
FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY BENEATH THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED QUASI- 
STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A MORE 
HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY). A 
HIGHLY AMPLIFIED AND QUASI-STATIONARY UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MS

CONVECTION TO CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT WITH LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINFALL POSSIBLE IN A FEW AREAS.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT

242 PM EDT MON JUL 1 2013

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER WESTERN TENNESSEE HAS
HELPED TO GENERATE SEVERAL CLUSTERS OF THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE
REGION THIS AFTERNOON. WITH SOME MODERATE INSTABILITY AND SHEAR TO
WORK WITH /WITH MUCAPE AOA 2000 J/KG AND BULK SHEAR VALUES AOA 30
KTS/ SOME OF THESE STORMS HAVE BEEN ABLE TO ORGANIZE AND BECOME
STRONG TO SEVERE. THE PRIMARY THREATS WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS
WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS AND HAIL /GIVEN THE LOWER MELTING LEVELS
WITH THE COOLER AIR ALOFT/. ALSO...GIVEN THE VERY MOIST ENVIRONMENT
IN PLACE...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THIS
ACTIVITY AS WELL. THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD BEGIN TO WANE AFTER
SUNSET...BUT SOME CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL STILL PERSIST
OVERNIGHT. LATE TONIGHT...THE POTENTIAL FOR PATCHY FOG WILL EXIST
GIVEN THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS AND CALM WINDS...SO HAVE
ADDED A MENTION OF THIS IN THE FORECAST AS WELL.

WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH REMAINING THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE
ACROSS THE REGION...ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL BE
POSSIBLE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT AS WELL...THOUGH COVERAGE MAY BE
A BIT LESS THAN THIS AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE CLOUD COVER AND
PRECIPITATION CHANCES...HIGHS WILL BE A BIT ON THE COOL SIDE AND
GENERALLY ONLY REACH IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S IN MOST SPOTS BY
THE LATE AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
THE CLOSED UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTHWEST WILL RETROGRADE TO THE MS 
VALLEY...AND THE AXIS OF DEEP MOISTURE THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE 
ATLANTIC COAST THE PAST FEW DAYS WILL SHIFT TO OUR AREA. FLOODING 
POTENTIAL APPEARS HIGH FOR THE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY PERIOD.
UNFORTUNATELY...INDEPENDENCE DAY CELEBRATIONS LOOK TO BE VERY SOGGY.

THE NAM AND GFS DIFFER WITH THE ONSET OF PRECIP WEDNESDAY...WITH THE 
NAM PRODUCING MUCH MORE QPF DURING THE DAY THAN THE GFS. WILL LEAN 
TOWARD THE SLOWER GFS...WITH POPS RAMPING UP TO CATEGORICAL 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE SYNOPTIC FORCING REALLY INCREASES. WITH THE 
RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET MOVING INTO A FAVORABLE POSITION 
AND REMAINING NEARLY STATIONARY...WE WILL SEE FRONTOGENETIC FORCING 
SITTING OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. THIS WILL BE 
ACTING ON A VERY MOIST AIR MASS WITH PW VALUES AROUND 2 INCHES AND A 
DEEP WARM CLOUD LAYER ABOVE 4000M. AT THIS TIME...PRECIP AMOUNTS 
THROUGH FRIDAY MAY BE ON THE ORDER OF 2 TO 5 INCHES ON 
AVERAGE...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE. WITH THE ONSET OF 
THE HEAVY PRECIP STILL OVER 48 HOURS AWAY...WILL HOLD OFF ON A FLOOD 
WATCH FOR NOW...ALTHOUGH IT APPEARS HIGHLY LIKELY THAT ONE WILL BE 
NEEDED EVENTUALLY AS WE GET CLOSER TO THE EVENT. 

AS THE UPPER LOW BEGINS TO RETREAT NORTHWARD AND BECOME AN OPEN WAVE 
TROUGH ON FRIDAY...THE ATLANTIC RIDGE WILL BUILD WEST AND BECOME 
MORE DOMINANT THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE RIDGE BECOMES CENTERED OVER 
GA AND THE CAROLINAS BY SUNDAY NIGHT. SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE RIDGE 
WILL GIVE DECREASING POPS AND ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR THE 
BEGINNING OF THE WEEK.

AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW CONTINUES TO SPIN ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE THIS
MORNING...AND WILL BRING THE FORECAST AREA A SHOT OF SOME MORE
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS LATER THIS AFTERNOON. FOR NOW...SOME DRY
SLOTTING HAS ALLOWED FORM SOME PARTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE
AREA WHICH SHOULD ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO RISE INTO THE 80S BY EARLY
TO MID AFTERNOON. LATER...ANOTHER SHORTWAVE AND LOBE OF MOISTURE IS
PROGGED TO TRACK INTO THE REGION BY 18-21Z...WHICH ALONG WITH
DAYTIME HEATING SHOULD TRIGGER SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION ACROSS THE
ENTIRE AREA. THOUGH THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT SHOULD BE FAIRLY
MARGINAL...SOME MODEST INSTABILITY COULD RESULT IN A FEW STORMS
BECOMING STRONG/SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WINDS BEING THE PRIMARY
THREAT. ADDITIONALLY THOUGH...ANY SHOWERS/STORMS THAT DO DEVELOP
WILL BE CAPABLE OF PRODUCING LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL GIVEN THE VERY
MOIST ENVIRONMENT.

.AVIATION...EASTERN LAKES THROUGH OHIO VALLEY UPPER TROUGH WILL
REMAIN IN PLACE FOR THE NEXT TWENTY FOUR HOURS. DEEP MOISTURE IS
PLENTIFUL ALONG THE ATLANTIC SEABOARD AS AN ATMOSPHERIC RIVER KEEPS
MOISTURE WELL SUPPLIED IN THIS AREA. PLACED SOME ACTION IN AT TRI
WHERE RADAR INDICATES SOME SHOWERS AND EVEN SOME THUNDER ARE MOVING
NORTH ACROSS THE EXTREME NORTHEASTERN CORNER OF THE STATE IN
ASSOCIATION WITH A HEALTHY SHORT WAVE DRIVING NORTH ACROSS THE MID
ATLANTIC REGION. THE OTHER SPOT THAT HAS A CHANCE OF SEEING A
SHOWER WOULD BE CHA THIS EVENING AS ANOTHER PIECE OF ENERGY IS
ROTATING EAST AROUND THE BASE OF THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY UPPER LOW.
THIS CONVECTION LOOKS LIKE IT IS DEVELOPING JUST EAST OF THE
TERMINAL. TYS MAY SEE SOME OF THIS LATER TONIGHT BUT PROBABILITY
TOO LOW AT THIS TIME. TRI MAY SEE SOME LIGHT FOG LATE TONIGHT BUT
NOT EXPECTING MUCH PROBLEMS WITH VSBY AT THE OTHER TERMINALS. WOULD
EXPECT MONDAY TO BE A LITTLE MORE ACTIVE DAY WITH SOME SHOWERS AND

WEAK IMPULSES THAT MAY HELP TO ENHANCE CONVECTION...AS MODELS HAVE 
BEEN HANDLING THE DETAILS POORLY. INSTABILITY EXPECTED TO REMAIN ON 
THE MODEST SIDE FOR THE PERIOD.  WILL GENERALLY UNDERCUT MOS POPS 
FOR TONIGHT AND KEEP ALL AREAS IN THE CHANCE RANGE.  WILL LOWER POPS 
MONDAY TO CHANCE IN CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOUTHEAST ZONES...BUT WILL 
HAVE LOW LIKELY POPS ELSEWHERE.  WILL GENERALLY ADJUST MAV TEMPS UP 
A BIT FOR LOWS TONIGHT...BUT NOT MUCH ARGUMENT WITH HIGHS FOR 
MONDAY.  


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH
WILL BE THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION THIS UPCOMING WEEK...PROVIDING GOOD CHANCES FOR
PRECIPITATION EACH DAY...ALONG WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY AND COOLER
CONDITIONS. THE UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT FROM THIS SYSTEM WILL COMBINE
WITH ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE AND DAYTIME HEATING WILL HELP TO
TRIGGER SOME SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS THE
ENTIRE AREA FOR MUCH OF THE WORK WEEK.

A BRIEF LULL IN THE ACTIVITY MAY ACTUALLY OCCUR ON TUESDAY AS MORE 
SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION IS EXPECTED. HOWEVER...AS THE LOW 
BEGINS TO RETROGRADE BACK TOWARD THE WEST TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY...IT WILL HELP TO FURTHER INCREASE A SOUTHERLY GULF 
MOISTURE FETCH. THUS...FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT LIKELY 
POPS SEEM REASONABLE AS SEVERAL UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVES WILL 
RESULTING IN THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND STORMS AND 
POTENTIALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND LOCALIZED FLOODING. THIS THREAT WILL 
CERTAINLY NEED TO BE MONITORED THE NEXT FEW DAYS...ESPECIALLY FOR 
THOSE WITH OUTDOOR PLANS FOR THE UPCOMING INDEPENDENCE DAY HOLIDAY. 
THUS...WILL ADDRESS THIS IN THE HWO. THE LATEST MODELS RUNS ARE 
BEGINNING TO HASTEN THE WESTWARD MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM...SO 
CONVECTION MAY BE A LITTLE LESS WIDESPREAD ON FRIDAY AND BEGIN TO 
BECOME MUCH MORE SCATTERED ON SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS SOME 
UPPER-LEVEL RIDGING BEGINS TO BUILD IN FROM THE EAST.

OVER THE MID MS VALLEY DURING THE PERIOD. INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH 
DEVELOPS NORTHWARD FROM THE GLFMEX THROUGH THE TN VALLEY. AIRMASS 
INITIALLY RELATIVELY DRY AND BEGINS TO MOISTEN FROM THE SE BY

CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TODAY THEN BECOME LIKELY ACROSS NE AREAS TONIGHT. 
WENT WITH PERSISTENCE FOR TEMPERATURES. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE EXTENDED.  MONDAY AND TUESDAY...AN UPPER 
TROUGH WILL BE OVER THE REGION.  THIS WILL PULL GULF MOISTURE INTO 
THE AREA.  THIS COMBINED WITH DAYTIME HEATING AND A COUPLE OF WEAK 
WAVES TRACKING THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW WILL GENERATE CONVECTION EACH 
DAY FOR HIGH CHANCE OR LIKELY POPS.  THE UPPER TROUGH WILL SHIFT WEST 
INTO THE CENTRAL U.S. ON WEDNESDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER SURGE OF GULF 
MOISTURE INTO THE REGION.  THE ADDITIONAL LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL 
HELP DESTABILIZE THE AIR MASS IN PLACE AND KEEP POPS AT LIKELY TO

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A 
WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. RADAR AND 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEAL A LINE OF CONVECTION OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY...WHICH WAS WEAKENING WITH THE SETTING OF THE SUN. THE UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SURFACE LOW OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY IS PROGGED TO FURTHER AMPLIFY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
OVERNIGHT. AS A RESULT...SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION MAY AFFECT THE 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TONIGHT...BEFORE COMPLETELY DISSIPATING.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO REMOVE SOME EVENING WORDING AND TO ADD A 
MENTION OF TSTORMS ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO 
DIG IN TO OUR WEST...AND FLOW WILL TAKE ON MORE OF A SOUTHERLY 
COMPONENT DURING THE PERIOD.  A SPOKE OF ENERGY ROTATING THROUGH 
UPPER TROUGH MAY BRING SOME SHOWERS TO NORTHWEST ZONES TONIGHT...SO 
WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS MAINLY NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW VA.  
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY INCREASES A BIT FOR SUNDAY SO WILL CARRY 
CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL NOT STRAY 
FAR.  

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)... AN UPPER-LEVEL
TROUGH WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION THIS UPCOMING WEEK...PROVIDING DECENT CHANCES FOR SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY...ALONG WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY AND COOLER
CONDITIONS. SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY THIS LOW WILL DROP SOUTH FROM
THE OHIO VALLEY INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THE UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT FROM
THIS SYSTEM WILL COMBINE WITH ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE AND DAYTIME
HEATING TO TRIGGER SOME SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND STORMS
/PARTICULARLY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS/ ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT.
THUS...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY ON MONDAY BEFORE TAPERING THEM
OFF SLIGHTLY TO HIGH END CHANCE MONDAY NIGHT.

THE AFOREMENTIONED LOW WILL BEGIN TO RETROGRADE BACK TOWARD THE  
WEST TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...HELPING TO FURTHER INCREASE A 
SOUTHERLY GULF MOISTURE FETCH. FROM WEDNESDAY THROUGH AT LEAST 
FRIDAY HIGH-END CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS SEEM REASONABLE AS SEVERAL 
UPPER-LEVEL SHORTWAVES WILL PROPAGATE AROUND THE BASE OF THE LOW AND 
ACROSS THE AREA...RESULTING IN THE POTENTIAL FOR WIDESPREAD SHOWERS 
AND STORMS AND POTENTIALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND LOCALIZED FLOODING. 
UNFORTUNATELY...THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION MAY BE 
INDEPENDENCE DAY...BUT THERE IS STILL UNCERTAINTY REGARDING WHICH 
AREA AND TIME PERIOD MAY BE MORE FAVORED ATTM THIS FAR OUT. 
HOWEVER...WILL CERTAINLY KEEP A MENTION OF THIS HEAVY RAINFALL 
POTENTIAL IN THE HWO. BY THE WEEKEND...SOME RIDGING MAY BEGIN TO 
NUDGE IN FROM THE EAST...SO HAVE TAPERED POPS OFF A BIT HEADING INTO 
SATURDAY FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE WILL 
LINGER OVER THE AREA TONIGHT.  WHILE DIFFICULT TO FIND MUCH ORGANIZED 
LIFT...WILL CARRY SOME SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
LINGERING CONVECTION.  AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEEPEN OVER THE 
AREA FRIDAY AS A COLD FRONT PUSHES THROUGH. WITH SIGNIFICANT 
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY AVAILABLE SHOULD SEE NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS.  WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS ALL ZONES.  SOME OF THESE 
STORMS MAY BECOME SEVERE...SO WILL CONTINUE MENTION IN HWO.  MAV 
TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE 
PATTERN...AND REVEAL A LONG WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER 
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION THIS WEEKEND AND LINGERING THROUGH 
THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. AS A RESULT...AN UNSETTLED PERIOD WILL BE 
IN STORE FOR THE FORECAST AREA THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED...WITH TEMPS 
A LITTLE COOLER THAN NORMAL AND SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING EACH 
DAY. RIGHT NOW...THE BEST CHANCES FOR CONVECTION APPEAR TO BE ON 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WHEN THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS BECOMES LOCATED OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY. BOTH THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS AGREE THAT THIS 
UPPER TROUGH WILL SLOWLY RETROGRADE TO THE WEST ON TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY...AND GRADUALLY DISSIPATE ON THURSDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...TRIED TO TIME THE MAIN 
AXIS OF CONVECTION IN ASSOCIATED WITH THE TWO CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES 
MAKING THEIR WAY ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. SO PLACED HIGHEST POPS 
SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS WITH LOWER POPS FARTHER NORTHWEST. 
STILL SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY WITH DECENT INSTABILITY FOR THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS SO MAINTAINED AT LEAST CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION 
DURING MAX HEATING. THE NEXT SHOT AT HIGHER POPS LOOKS TO BE FRIDAY 
AS MODELS INDICATE ANOTHER SIGNIFICANT WAVE DROPS INTO THE REGION ON 
THE PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW COMPLIMENTS OF THE EASTERN U.S. 
LONGWAVE TROUGH. SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY ALONG WITH ADEQUATE SHEAR 
SHOULD ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER CONVECTIVE COMPLEX TO 
MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SO USED LIKELY POPS ON FRIDAY WHILE 
DROPPING OFF TO SLIGHT CHANCE FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE ACTION SHIFTS 
SOUTHEAST AWAY FROM THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. FOR THE MOST PART STAYED 
IN THE MIDDLE OF GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES WITH THE EXCEPTION OF 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE WHICH HAS POPPED UP TO THE WARMEST MOS MAXES FOR 
A FEW DAYS IN A ROW NOW. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...27/00Z MODELS WERE FAIRLY 
CONSISTENT FROM 12Z RUN AND STILL ADVERTISE THE LONGWAVE TROUGH 
SETTING UP OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION. THIS LEADS TO 
PERIODS OF CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION...MORE THAN JUST DIURNAL 20 TO 
30 PERCENT POPS EACH DAY.

27/00Z GFSX MOS POPS ARE STILL QUITE HIGH FOR SATURDAY...BUT 
GENERALLY ALL MODELS PREDICT A BREAK WITH JUST DIURNAL ACTIVITY. 
WILL KEEP OUR CURRENT LOWER POPS IN FOR SATURDAY WHICH ARE QUITE 
CLOSE TO A MOS BLEND OF THE GFS AND NAM POPS...AND STAY WELL BELOW 
THE HIGH CHANCE GFSX MOS POPS.

SOME UNCERTAINTY AS FAR OUT AS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...BUT STILL 
SEEING SIGNS OF A SURFACE WAVE DEVELOPING ON THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY. THIS SUPPORTS HIGHEST POPS FOR TUESDAY...SO 
NUDGED POPS UP TO A SOLID 50 PERCENT (ABOVE CLIMO). CARRYING CHANCE 
POPS FOR WEDNESDAY CLOSE TO CLIMO AND LATEST GFSX MOS POPS.

INSTABILITY OVERNIGHT AND THE LOW LEVEL WIND SHEAR INCREASES.  A 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE AREA THIS 
EVENING...AND THERE IS THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING WINDS WITH THESE

TORNADO CANNOT BE RULED OUT AS WELL.  WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION 
SEVERE THREAT IN HWO.  WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS ALL ZONES TONIGHT.  
SHORT WAVE WILL BE EXITING BY EARLY THURSDAY...BUT ENOUGH 
MOISTURE/INSTABILITY WILL LINGER TO KEEP HIGH CHANCE TO LOW LIKELY 
POPS.     


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
AN ACTIVE PATTERN IN PLACE FOR THE FORECAST AREA FOR THIS FORECAST 
PERIOD. THE UPPER LOW WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
PLACING THE FORECAST AREA UNDER/NEAR THE TROUGH AXIS THROUGH THE 
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. THIS UPPER LOW IS EXPECTED TO RETROGRADE INTO 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS STATES THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. NEEDLESS TO SAY 
WITH THE ACTIVE PATTERN THERE WILL BE AT LEAST A CHANCE OF 
PRECIPITATION EVERY DAY AND NIGHT THROUGH NEXT WEEK. 

TRIED TO TIME PRECIPITATION AS BEST WE COULD WITH FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
LOOKING LIKE THE BETTER DAY FOR GETTING WET...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SW 
VIRGINIA. THIS IS WHEN THE ILL-DEFINED FRONTAL BOUNDARY OOZES SLOWLY 
INTO THE REGION. SATURDAY MAY PROVE TO BE FAIRLY DRY FOR MOST 
LOCATIONS HOWEVER SCATTERED ACTIVITY WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE 
AFTERNOON. 

PREFRONTAL WARMING WILL LIKELY OCCUR ON FRIDAY THUS SOME AREAS 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE COULD REACH THE LOWER 90S...AND IT WILL 
BE MUGGY. THE SUBSEQUENT DAYS WILL LIKELY BE COOLER WITH 
CLOUDY/RAINY TYPE CONDITIONS PERSISTING EACH DAY UNTIL THIS PESKY

DEVELOP AGAIN DURING THE DAY. PLACED A SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE POP 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE MORNING AS 
A WEAK SHORT WAVE PRESSES EAST ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY TOWARD 
THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. STAYED WITH A BLEND OF MAV/MET MOS MAX 
TEMPS TODAY WHILE TRENDING ABOUT A DEGREE ABOVE THE WARMEST MOS MINS 
TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
EXPECTED TO BE ONGOING THURSDAY MORNING...THEN DECREASE THROUGH THE 
DAY FROM THE WEST WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH AXIS. 
HOWEVER AN UNSETTLED PATTERN WILL CONTINUE AS AN UPPER LOW DROPS 
SOUTHWARD INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY. THIS WILL INCREASE 
POPS AGAIN FRIDAY AS A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE AREA. MOISTURE WILL 
BE LIMITED WITH A WESTERLY 850 MB FLOW AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO WILL 
KEEP POPS IN THE HIGH CHANCE RANGE FOR FRIDAY. 

A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL BE OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND...THEN RETROGRADE AND EVOLVE INTO A CLOSED LOW OVER THE 
LOWER OHIO VALLEY/MID MS VALLEY BY MONDAY. SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE 
THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND WITH THE TROUGH OVERHEAD CREATING SOME WEAK 
INSTABILITY...BUT ORGANIZED FORCING APPEARS LACKING AT THIS TIME 
ALONG WITH A LACK OF DEEP MOISTURE IN THE W-NW FLOW ALOFT. WILL 
CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. PRECIP CHANCES INCREASE 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY ONCE THE UPPER LOW BECOMES ESTABLISHED TO OUR 
WEST AND THE SOUTHERLY FLOW OF MOISTURE INCREASES. WILL HAVE HIGH 
CHANCE POPS BOTH DAYS...ALONG WITH TEMPS BELOW CLIMO AND GFS MOS 
GUIDANCE.

POINTS AND SUBSEQUENT RH. REMOVED POPS WITH LESS THAN 20 PERCENT 
EXPECTED. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD 
QUICKLY DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET TONIGHT AS INSTABILITY BEGINS TO 
WEAKEN. HOWEVER...A FEW STORMS COULD BECOME STRONG BEFORE THEY 
DISSIPATE WITH THE MAIN THREATS BEING GUSTY WINDS AND HEAVY RAIN. NO 
BIG CHANGES TO PREVIOUS POPS AS THEY STILL LOOK REASONABLE AT THIS 
TIME. OVERNIGHT TEMPS SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO LAST NIGHT...SO WENT ONCE 
AGAIN WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST. TOMORROW THINGS BEGIN TO CHANGE 
AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES OUR AREA. AS OF NOW...I DON'T 
BELIEVE UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WILL ARRIVE IN TIME TO IMPACT TOMORROW 
AFTERNOONS CONVECTIVE COVERAGE. THE NAM DOESN'T INDICATE THE 850MB 
JET REACHING THE PLATEAU UNTIL RIGHT AROUND 00Z. WITH THIS 
THINKING....GREATEST COVERAGE SHOULD CONTINUE TO FAVOR HIGHER 
ELEVATION LOCATIONS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON HOURS. IF THE NAM IS 
CORRECT...THE PLATEAU WILL BE AN AREA TO WATCH AS THE LATEST NAM 
SHOWS A LINE OF CONVECTION APPROACHING OUR WESTERN AREAS RIGHT 
AROUND THE 00Z TIME-FRAME WITH THE ARRIVAL OF THE 850MB JET. GFS IS 
SLOWER AND DOESN'T BRING THE JET IN UNTIL AROUND 06Z...WHICH WOULD 
LIMIT CONVECTION. OVERALL...KEPT POPS AND TEMPS SIMILAR TO THE 
PREVIOUS ISSUANCE THROUGH TOMORROW AFTERNOON.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE PATTERN STILL
EXPECTED TO TRANSITION TO AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER MOST OF THE
EASTERN U.S. BY THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. THE INITIAL
SHORTWAVE TROUGH IS HANDLED SIMILARLY AMONGST VARIOUS MODELS...
WITH ORGANIZED CONVECTION LIKELY TO BE MOVING INTO THE NRN PLATEAU
AND SW VA AREAS BEFORE 12Z THURSDAY...THEN GENERALLY FROM NW TO SE
OVER REST OF THE AREA ON THURSDAY. THE 12Z NAM MODEL HAS SLOWED
DOWN A BIT AND IS IN LINE WITH THIS TIMING...SO POPS WERE ADJUSTED
ACCORDINGLY WITH A SWATH OF LIKELY POPS CARRIED ON THURSDAY.

OTHERWISE...POPS STILL NEEDED EVERY DAY OF THE EXTENDED WITH A 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY LIKELY TO BE IN THE VICINITY. SHORTWAVE ENERGY 
CARVING OUT THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH MAY DEVELOP WEAK WAVES ALONG THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY...WHICH WOULD SUPPORT HIGHER THAN CLIMO POPS. 
MODELS HINT AT THIS HAPPENING ON SATURDAY AND AGAIN BY LATE MONDAY 
OR TUESDAY. FOLLOWED THE GFSX MOS TREND AND RAISED POPS SOME FOR 
SATURDAY AND INTRODUCED TUESDAY WITH CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. 

FOR TEMPS...GFS MOS MAX TEMPS LOOKED TOO WARM FOR THURSDAY AND I 
STAYED MUCH CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM MOS MAXES. GFSX MOS MINS LOOKED 
QUITE GOOD EACH PERIOD...BUT I STAYED WELL BELOW UPPER 80S TO LOWER 
90S FOR HIGHS...GIVEN THE DEVELOPING TROUGH AND INCREASED RAIN 
CHANCES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
THE PAST FEW DAYS HAVE BEEN DIFFICULT TO GET A HANDLE ON CONVECTIVE 
COVERAGE AND LOCATION. WITH THE LACK OF WELL DEFINED FORCING 
MECHANISMS...THE GENERAL TREND HAS BEEN FOR CONVECTION TO FAVOR THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU. FOR TODAY AND 
TOMORROW...WILL CONTINUE THAT GENERAL TREND. THE NAM AND GFS 
CONTINUE TO HAVE LARGE DIFFERENCE IN POPS...WITH THE NAM IN THE 
LIKELY RANGE AND GFS SHOWING A LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP. WILL LEAN 
TOWARD THE LOWER SIDE WITH LOW CHANCE POPS IN THE VALLEY BOTH 
DAYS...AND HIGHER CHANCE POPS IN THE MOUNTAINS. WILL FOLLOW 
PERSISTENCE FOR HIGH AND LOW TEMPS.

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...AND THIS SHOULD GIVE US SOME BETTER 
LIFT FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. HOWEVER THE GULF REMAINS CUT OFF 
WITH A WESTERLY 850 MB FLOW...SO MOISTURE IS NOT PLENTIFUL. MODELS 
HAVE BEEN TRENDING DOWNWARD WITH POPS THIS PERIOD...SO WILL LOWER 
POPS A BIT TO A HIGH CHANCE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY WHEN THE 
700 MB TROUGH AXIS PASSES THROUGH. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
BASICALLY STAYED WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WITHOUT A GREAT DEAL
OF CONFIDENCE TO ADJUST POPS HIGHER OR LOWER IN ANY PARTICULAR
PERIOD. PERHAPS THE SLIGHTLY HIGHER CHANCE POP IS WARRANTED ON
SATURDAY AS MODELS SWING A SHORT WAVE FROM THE OHIO-MID MISSISSIPPI
VALLEY REGION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ENHANCING
CONVECTION. BEST TO KEEP THE LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY GOING SUNDAY
AND MONDAY WITH MEAN LONG WAVE EASTERN U.S. TROUGH HOLDING ITS
POSITION. WENT ABOUT A DEGREE UNDER MEX MOS MAX TEMPS THROUGH THE
PERIOD. STAYED CLOSE TO SUGGESTED MINS EARLY BUT ADJUSTED A LITTLE
MILDER DURING THE FINAL THREE DAYS OF THE EXTENDED.

SOME MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO THE FORECAST TONIGHT...BUT EVERYTHING
APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK OVERALL. AN UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE CONTINUES
TO MOVE ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHERN KENTUCKY...AND HAS
HELPED TO MAINTAIN SOME ISOLATED CLUSTERS OF STORMS THIS EVENING.
A SUBTLE VORT MAX OVER SOUTHERN KENTUCKY HAS TRIED TO TRIGGER SOME
ADDITIONAL ACTIVITY ALONG THE NORTHERN PLATEAU INTO EASTERN
KENTUCKY...BUT THE OVERALL INTENSITY OF THIS ACTIVITY HAS WANED
WITH THE SETTING SUN. THINK THAT THIS TREND WILL CONTINUE OVER THE
NEXT COUPLE OF HOURS...SO HAVE LIFTED MENTIONABLE POPS OVER THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY AFTER 04Z OR SO. STILL...THINK THAT
SOME ISOLATED STORMS REMAIN POSSIBLE ACROSS THE FAR NORTHERN AND
NORTHEAST ZONES OVERNIGHT GIVEN THE PRESENCE OF THIS FEATURE AND
THE WARM/MOIST AIRMASS IN PLACE. OTHERWISE...THINK THAT MOSTLY DRY
AND PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY CONDITIONS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AFTER
MIDNIGHT WILL PREVAIL WITH EVEN WARMER LOWS DROPPING INTO THE MID

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
THE THEME OF A SUMMER TIME PATTERN CONTINUES DUE TO A BERMUDA HIGH 
OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST KEEPING US WARM AND HUMID. ONGOING CONVECTION 
THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD BEGIN TO WEAKEN AROUND SUNSET AS INSTABILITY 
DECREASES. ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NE TN AND SW VA DURING THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS AS A WEAK VORT MAX OVER W KY WILL SLOWLY MAKE ITS 
WAY ACROSS THIS AREA OVERNIGHT. AREAS THAT SEE RAIN TODAY OR TONIGHT 
COULD HAVE SOME FOG IN THE MORNING. AREA WIDE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
STORMS ARE ON TAP FOR TOMORROW AS LATEST NAM SOUNDINGS SHOW PWS 
INCREASING TO AROUND 1.5 INCHES AND INSTABILITY RANGING FROM 1500 TO 
2000 J/KG BY TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WILL CONTINUE WITH PERSISTENCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT AND TOMORROW.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE PATTERN MAKES A SIGNIFICANT TRANSITION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO
THURSDAY AS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH PUSHES THE BERMUDA RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE SE. A DEEPER TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE THEN GRADUALLY
DEVELOPS OVER THE EASTERN U.S. FOR THE WEEKEND INTO MONDAY. 

THIS SHOULD EQUATE TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY...SO RAIN
CHANCES WERE INCREASED TO LIKELY ON THURSDAY. A FEW STRONG TO
SEVERE STORMS LOOK QUITE POSSIBLE FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND
EVENING...GIVEN THE INCREASED LIFT AND MOISTURE...PLUS COOLER TEMPS
ALOFT. 

OTHERWISE...TIMING ROUNDS OF CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION FOR THE REST
OF THE LONG TERM IS CHALLENGING...AS THERE IS A GOOD DEGREE OF
VARIANCE AMONGST THE MODEL SOLUTIONS. CAN'T LIMIT CONVECTION TO
JUST THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING IN GENERAL...BUT ALSO CAN'T REALLY
AGREE COMPLETELY WITH THE POPS WELL ABOVE CLIMO ON BOTH SATURDAY
AND SUNDAY. FOR NOW...ADDED NEW DAY 7 GRIDS (MONDAY) WITH CHANCE
POPS AND MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS MOSTLY TO THE EARLIER PERIODS OF THE
LONG TERM. LOCAL APPLICATION PROGRAM SHOWS SEVERAL OPPORTUNITIES TO
IMPROVE OVER MOS FOR THE LONG TERM.

2000 TO 2500 J/KG BY 18Z. SOME AREAS MAY BECOME SLIGHTLY MORE OR 
LESS UNSTABLE DEPENDING ON CLOUD COVER. IT STILL LOOKS LIKE AREAS TO 
THE WEST HAVE GREATER CHANCES OF SEEING CONVECTION...AS LATEST NAM 
AND RUC MODELS DEVELOP CONVECTION OVER MIDDLE TN AND ADVANCE IT 
TOWARDS THE PLATEAU. CONVECTIVE COVERAGE SHOULD BE A LITTLE MORE 
WIDESPREAD THAN THE PAST FEW DAYS AND NOT LIMITED TO ONLY THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. ALSO...CAN'T RULE OUT AN ISOLATED SEVERE STORM TODAY DUE 
TO INCREASED INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE...WITH THE MAIN THREAT BEING 
DAMAGING WINDS. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IS ALSO POSSIBLE DUE TO SLOW 
STORM MOTIONS OF AROUND 9 KTS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SOME SHOWERS ARE PERSISTING IN THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE AREA THIS 
MORNING...AND THE RUC SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
CONVERGENCE IN THIS AREA. THE RUC SHOWS THIS WEAKENING BY 12Z...BUT 
WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN ALL AREAS THROUGH THE MORNING. 
IN THE AFTERNOON...WE WILL SEE A REMNANT VORT MAX FROM CONVECTION 
OVER W KY ENTER THE AREA...AND THE NAM DEVELOPS CONVECTION IN MIDDLE 
TN AND THE PLATEAU ALONG AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY. INSTABILITY APPEARS 
GREATEST IN THAT AREA...SO WILL HAVE HIGHEST POPS WEST TODAY...BUT 
STILL IN THE CHANCE RANGE EVERYWHERE. WILL CONTINUE WITH PERSISTENCE 
FOR TEMPERATURES TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)... 
BERMUDA RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER THE SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES THROUGH
MID-WEEK. GFS AND NAM SHOW PWS AND INSTABILITY INCREASING TO 1.4 TO
1.6 INCHES FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY..SO COVERAGE AND INTENSITY OF
STORMS WILL LIKELY INCREASE TO SCATTERED. FOR THURSDAY INTO NEXT
WEEKEND...RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL WEAKEN
ALLOWING A SERIES OF UPPER SHORT- WAVES OVER THE GREAT LAKES INTO
THE NORTHEAST TO CARVE OUT A LONG- WAVE TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN
UNITED STATES.

LOOKING AT INSTABILITY AND UPPER DYNAMICS...BEST CHANCE OF MORE 
WIDESPREAD STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS STILL POINT TO THURSDAY AND WILL 
MENTION IN THE HWO. A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH SATURDAY WILL BRING 
IN DRIER DEWPOINTS FOR SUNDAY.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS NUMBERS CLOSELY..EXCEPT 
FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK. LOWER THICKNESS AND GREATER 
COVERAGE OF CLOUDS AND CONVECTION DOES NOT WARRANT THE GFS HIGHS..SO 
UNDER-CUT A DEGREE OR TWO.

VERY MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING AS EVERYTHING
APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. THE ISOLATED STORMS ACROSS THE REGION WILL
QUICKLY DIE OFF AFTER SUNSET...RESULTING IN A PARTLY CLOUDY AND
CALM NIGHT. THE ADDED CLOUD COVER SHOULD HELP TO KEEP LOWS A DEGREE
OR SO HIGHER THAN LAST NIGHT...BUT THEY WILL GENERALLY STILL DROP
INTO THE MID TO UPPER 60S. THE ONE CHANGE THAT WAS MADE WAS TO ADD
A MENTION OF AREAS OF FOG AFTER 08Z GIVEN THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC EXTENDING ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEAST...WITH A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THE CLOSED UPPER LOW THAT HAS BEEN OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THE PAST FEW DAYS IS PROGGED TO DRIFT NORTHWARD TONIGHT...AND 
MERGE WITH THE STRONGER SOUTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW OVER THE 
GREAT LAKES REGION. MODEL SOUNDINGS ON MONDAY REVEAL A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN THE VERTICAL MOISTURE PROFILE OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
(COMPARED TO TODAY)...WHICH RESULTS IN A LITTLE MORE INSTABILITY 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY AFTERNOON. THUS...EXPECT A LITTLE 
BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION AREA WIDE ON MONDAY (COMPARED TO 
TODAY)...WITH A SLIGHTLY BETTER COVERAGE AROUND THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN 
THE GFS AND NAM MODEL GUIDANCE FOR TONIGHT AND MONDAY...WHICH IS 
ESSENTIALLY A PERSISTENCE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE THEME CONTINUES WITH 
THE LATEST FORECAST...SUMMER TIME PATTERN THROUGH MID-WEEK AND THEN 
A SHIFT TO A MORE ACTIVE PATTERN WITH THE APPROACH OF AN UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH. THE TROUGH LOOKS TO SETUP ACROSS OUR AREA TOWARD THE END OF 
THE WEEK AND REMAIN THROUGH THE END OF THE EXTENDED.

A BERMUDA HIGH WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
THROUGH MID-WEEK. LATEST GFS/NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW PW VALUES 
INCREASING TO 1.3-1.6 INCHES FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WHILE 
CAPES GENERALLY RANGE BETWEEN 1500-2000 J/KG. TYPICAL DIURNAL 
CONVECTION IS EXPECTED THROUGH THIS TIME-FRAME WITH THE GREATEST 
COVERAGE OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ONE INTERESTING NOTE IS THAT 
THE NAM SHOWS A 500 MB LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVING DOWN INTO OUR AREA ON 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON OUT OF KENTUCKY...WHILE THE GFS KEEPS THE WAVE 
WEAKER AND FURTHER NORTH. IF THE NAM IS CORRECT...POPS MAY NEED TO 
BE INCREASED FOR TUESDAY AS THIS SHORTWAVE WILL HELP TO ENHANCE 
COVERAGE. FOR NOW...WILL CONTINUE TO TREND CLOSER TO THE GFS AND 
KEEP POPS WHERE THEY ARE HAVE BEEN OVER THE PAST FEW ISSUANCES.

FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK...BERMUDA HIGH BEGINS TO WEAKEN AS 
AN UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST UNITED 
STATES. A SERIES OF FRONTS WILL MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/ 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AS THE UPPER TROUGH BECOMES MORE ESTABLISHED 
OVER THE EASTERN UNITED STATES INTO NEXT WEEKEND. THE UPPER TROUGH 
AND FRONTAL BOUNDARIES WILL INCREASE THE CHANCES OF CONVECTION. 
WOULD GO HIGHER WITH POPS...BUT STILL UNCERTAIN IN TIMING OF FRONTAL 
BOUNDARIES. BEST CHANCE OF MORE ORGANIZED SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE 
THURSDAY AS MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY INCREASES AHEAD OF DEVELOPING 
UPPER TROUGH AND INITIAL BOUNDARY. THE MAIN CONCERN WILL BE DAMAGING 
WINDS...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL...AND MARGINAL SEVERE HAIL UP TO 1 
INCH.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A WARM 
AND HUMID AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE 
A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL LOW CENTERED NEAR CHA...WHICH IS PROGGED TO 
SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHWARD TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A 
FAIRLY SIMILAR PROFILE TO TODAY...BUT WITH A LITTLE MORE MOISTURE ON 
SUNDAY. THUS...WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED AGAIN BY

SLIGHTLY BETTER COVERAGE AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE GFS AND NAM MODEL
GUIDANCE...WHICH IS ESSENTIALLY A PERSISTENCE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM 
PREVIOUS DISCUSSION DUE TO THE TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN ACROSS OUR 
AREA. A BERMUDA HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH ABOUT MID-WEEK. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR GENERALLY 
DIURNAL CONVECTION POSSIBLE EACH DAY. COVERAGE WILL SLIGHTLY 
INCREASE EARLY NEXT WEEK AS SOUNDINGS SHOW A BIT MORE MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE REGION WITH PWS INCREASING TO 1.3 TO 1.4 INCHES BY 
TUESDAY. MOISTURE INCREASE IS DUE TO A MORE SOUTHERLY FLOW RETURNING 
ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES. CONVECTION THROUGH THIS PERIOD WILL 
GENERALLY BE TERRAIN DRIVEN. THE TYPICAL AREAS SUCH AS THE PLATEAU 
AND THE SPINE OF THE APPALCHIANS WILL BE THE MAIN AREAS OF FOCUS... 
WITH A FEW STORMS DRIFTING DOWN INTO THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. TYPICAL 
ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ARE WHAT CAN BE EXPECTED...WITH THE 
MAIN CONCERN BEING DAMAGING WINDS...HAIL UP TO QUARTER SIZE...AND 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.

AN UPPER LOW REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS...AND WILL DRIFT SLOWLY NORTH THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. 
THE PAST FEW DAYS...DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED OVER 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND DRIFTED INTO THE VALLEY. EXPECT THAT THIS 
WILL BE THE SCENARIO AGAIN TODAY. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS ALONG THE 
MOUNTAINS WITH SLIGHT CHANCES IN THE VALLEY AND PLATEAU. THIS IS 
ABOVE MOS GUIDANCE...WHICH HAS BEEN TOO LOW LATELY. LIKE 
YESTERDAY...THE SEVERE THREAT APPEARS LOW...ALTHOUGH SOME GUSTY 
WINDS AND HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS. 
WILL END POPS BY MIDNIGHT. TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO BE NEAR NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
A BERMUDA HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS THROUGH ABOUT MID-WEEK WITH GENERALLY DIURNAL
CONVECTION POSSIBLE EACH DAY. COVERAGE WILL BE A LITTLE MORE EARLY
NEXT WEEK AS SOUNDINGS SHOW A BIT MORE MOISTURE ACROSS THE REGION
WITH PWS INCREASING TO 1.3 TO 1.4 INCHES. GREATEST COVERAGE WILL BE
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. TYPICAL ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE
STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE EACH DAY WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING
DAMAGING WINDS...HAIL UP TO QUARTER SIZE AND LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL.

VERY MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO THE FORECAST AS EVERYTHING APPEARS TO BE

QUICKLY DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET...RESULTING IN MOSTLY CLEAR AND CALM

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL LOW
PRESSURE AREA OVER NORTHERN GA AND SOUTHEASTERN TN WILL REMAIN
NEARLY STATIONARY THROUGH SATURDAY. THIS UPPER LOW WILL CAUSE AN
INCREASE IN COVERAGE OF STORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS COULD BE STRONG TO SEVERE...WITH LOCALLY HEAVY
RAINFALL THE MAIN THREAT DUE TO THE LIGHT WIND FLOW THROUGHOUT THE
TROPOSPHERE...BUT GUSTY WINDS AND HAIL WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE.
EXPECT THESE STORMS TO SLOWLY WEAKEN AND DISSIPATE AFTER
SUNSET...WITH CLOUDS LIKELY LINGERING THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT DUE TO
THE UPPER LOW. FOR SATURDAY...SOUNDINGS SHOW A SLIGHTLY DRIER
ATMOSPHERE...BUT WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS STILL
DEVELOPING IN THE AFTERNOON. THUS...COULD SEE ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING AGAIN...BUT MAINLY AROUND THE HIGHER

GENERALLY FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE FORECAST WITH CLOUDS FROM THE UPPER
LOW EXPECTED TO KEEP LOW TEMPERATURES WARMER THAN GUIDANCE TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WILL CONTINUE TO BE IN
A TYPICAL SUMMER PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED. THE RESULT WILL BE A
CHANCE OF DIURNAL CONVECTION EACH DAY WITH BEST CHANCES OVER HIGHER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
MOST OF THE CONVECTION THAT DEVELOPED YESTERDAY WAS ASSOCIATED WITH 
AN UPPER LOW. TODAY...THE LOW WILL BE POSITIONED OVER NE GA/SW NC/NW 
SC. THUS THE BEST CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT WILL BE IN 
OUR SW NC COUNTIES AND OVER THE SMOKIES. THE STEERING WINDS IN THE 
850-500 MB LAYER WILL BE MAINLY FROM THE EAST...SO STORMS THAT 
DEVELOP OVER THE RIDGE TOPS WILL LIKELY DRIFT INTO THE VALLEY. WILL 
SPREAD CHANCE POPS FROM THE MOUNTAINS INTO EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE 
TN VALLEY...WITH SLIGHT CHANCES NEAR THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. SEVERE 
THREAT LOOKS LOW...BUT HEAVY RAINFALL CERTAINLY LOOKS POSSIBLE AS 
THE STORMS WILL BE SLOW MOVING. THE DIURNALLY-DRIVEN CONVECTION 
SHOULD DISSIPATE BY MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
WEAK H5 LOW PRESSURE WILL WOBBLE AROUND THE SOUTHEAST FOR MUCH OF
THE PERIOD...AND SOMEWHAT ENHANCE THE PROBABILITIES OF DIURNAL
CONVECTION EACH DAY. VERY LATE IN THE PERIOD TROUGHING OVER THE

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
A SURFACE HIGH WILL SLOWLY SLIDE EAST ACROSS THE AREA TODAY...WITH
A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE REMAINING IN PLACE OVER CENTRAL GEORGIA.
WITH A WARM/MOIST AND MARGINALLY TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS
PROGGED TO BE IN PLACE...THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME DIURNALLY INDUCED
CONVECTION ALONG THE MOUNTAINS...AND TO A LESSER EXTENT THE PLATEAU
AND VALLEY WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE
AFOREMENTIONED DISTURBANCE MAY ALSO PROVIDE AN EXTRA BIT OF LIFT
TODAY...AND PERHAPS AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF THIS ISOLATED TO
SCATTERED ACTIVITY. BY AN HOUR OR TWO AFTER SUNSET...THIS
CONVECTION WILL WANE RESULTING IN A FAIRLY CALM AND DRY NIGHT ONCE
AGAIN. HIGHS WILL BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN WEDNESDAY...PEAKING
IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN MOST LOCATIONS.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
RATHER TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN SETTING UP FOR THE LONG
TERM...WHICH KEEPS TEMPS VERY NEAR SEASONAL NORMALS...AND RAIN
CHANCES LIMITED TO DIURNAL ACTIVITY IN THE 20 TO 30 PERCENT RANGE
FOR POPS. LACK OF A FOCUS OTHER THAN TERRAIN AND DAYTIME HEATING IS
THE RULE...ALTHO MOISTURE DOES INCREASE BY MONDAY THRU WEDNESDAY.
THIS INCREASES INSTABILITY TO MODERATE LEVELS OR HIGHER EACH
AFTERNOON...PLUS A POSSIBLE WEAKNESS IN THE UPPER RIDGE BY TUESDAY
OR WEDNESDAY. 500 MB FLOW LOOKS QUITE DIFFLUENT BY THEN...WHICH
COULD EASILY ALLOW FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MCS ACTIVITY TO TRACK SE
FROM THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. OF COURSE MUCH UNCERTAINTY AT THIS
POINT...SO MAIN CHANGE WAS TO TREND UP ON POPS TO NEAR CLIMO VALUES
(30 TO 40 PERCENT) BY MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. GFSX MOS POPS ARE A
BIT HIGHER THAN CLIMO...BUT I WILL DEFER TO LATER SHIFTS TO MAKE
ANY FURTHER POP INCREASES.

FOR TEMPS...20/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE CONSISTENT WITH 19/12Z VALUES 
AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED...UNTIL THE MOISTURE INCREASES EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. AT THAT POINT...I STAYED A COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW THE LOWER 
90S MAX TEMPS OFFERED UP FOR SOUTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL GA AND 
SOUTHERN SC...WITH A WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
ISOLATED CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AS A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
DEVELOPS. OVERALL...IT APPEARS THAT A STAGNANT PATTERN...TYPICAL OF 
THIS TIME OF YEAR...WILL LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT. WITH A MARGINALLY TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
DEVELOPING EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING...EXPECT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP (MAINLY AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS)...WITH A 
FEW STORMS POSSIBLY BECOMING STRONG TO SEVERE WITH DAMAGING WINDS 
AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...WHICH IS 
ESSENTIALLY A PERSISTENCE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LOOKS LIKE AN UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDS ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE U.S. OVER THE WEEKEND 
SUPPRESSING CONVECTION TO SOME DEGREE...LIMITING DEVELOPMENT TO SOME 
OF THE MAJOR TERRAIN...INCLUDING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE 
MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. THE SURFACE THROUGH 85H 
RIDGE SLIPS JUST A LITTLE EAST THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK WHILE 
A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVELENGTH FEATURES RIDE OVER THE TOP OF THE BIG 
RIDGE EFFECTIVELY SUPPRESSING ITS INFLUENCE...ESPECIALLY BY 
WEDNESDAY. INCREASING SOUTHERLY FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE LOW 
LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE CENTER WILL MOISTEN AND HELP TO DESTABILIZE THE 
LOCAL ATMOSPHERE LEADING TO A SLIGHTLY BETTER POSSIBILITY FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. STILL...UNCERTAINTY A

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AND DIFFUSE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
EXTENDING WEST TO EAST ACROSS SOUTHERN KENTUCKY AND SOUTHERN WEST 
VA...WITH A WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHWARD INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...AND MAY TRIGGER SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A DRY VERTICAL PROFILE OVERALL...BUT THERE 
MAY BE ENOUGH MOISTURE AROUND 850 MB TO GENERATE SOME ISOLATED 
CONVECTION AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. A 
WEAK STEERING WIND FLOW BETWEEN 5 AND 10 MPH MAY KEEP THIS 
CONVECTION CONFINED TO AROUND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT WILL PLAN 
TO MENTION SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION FOR THE VALLEY AREAS SINCE THESE 
NORTHEAST WINDS AND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAY PUSH SOME OF THIS 
CONVECTION  OUT INTO THE VALLEYS. MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO REVEAL A 
FAIRLY DRY MID LEVEL AND AN INVERTED V PROFILE IN THE BOUNDARY 
LAYER...SO AM CONCERNED THAT SOME DAMAGING WINDS COULD BE POSSIBLE 
WITH A FEW STORMS THAT MANAGE TO DEVELOP. THUS...WILL UPDATE THE 
HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO MENTION THIS POSSIBILITY.

OVERALL...WILL UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO MENTION ISOLATED 
CONVECTION EVERYWHERE...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS AND SKY CONDITIONS A 
LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS EARLY THIS MORNING...ALONG WITH
CALM WINDS HAVE RESULTED IN PATCHY FOG DEVELOPMENT AND EVEN SOME
LOW STATUS NEAR AREA RIVERS AND LAKES. THIS FOG WILL LINGER THROUGH
DAYBREAK BEFORE DISSIPATING BY 12-13Z OR SO. A SURFACE HIGH WILL
CONTINUE TO NUDGE ITS WAY INTO THE REGION...RESULTING IN DRY
CONDITIONS AND A MOSTLY SUNNY SKY BY THE AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES
WILL BE WARMER THAN TUESDAY GIVEN THE CLEARER CONDITIONS...REACHING
THE LOW TO MID 80S IN MOST LOCATIONS...WITH SOME AREAS ALONG THE
SOUTHERN ZONES CREEPING INTO THE UPPER 80S. HOWEVER...DID TWEAK
TEMPERATURES DOWN A DEGREE OR SO GIVEN THE PREVAILING NORTHEAST
FLOW THAT SHOULD LINGER THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY. AN ISOLATED STORM
MAY BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS LATE IN THE DAY...BUT THINK
DRY CONDITIONS WILL BE THE PREVALENT IN MOST SPOTS. THERE MAY BE
ANOTHER CHANCE FOR SOME LOCALIZED AREAS OF FOG LATE TONIGHT...BUT
DID NOT HAVE ENOUGH CONFIDENCE THAT IT WILL BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO
MENTION IN THE FORECAST ATTM.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
DID NOT SEE MUCH OPPORTUNITY TO SIGNIFICANTLY IMPROVE ON PREVIOUS
FORECAST GRIDS. UPPER RIDGE BUILDING ACROSS THE REGION BEHIND THE
EXITING TROUGH TODAY...WITH LITTLE CHANGE UNTIL THE UPPER RIDGE
FLATTENS OUT A BIT BY MONDAY OR TUESDAY. THE SURFACE RIDGE STAYS
CENTERED GENERALLY TO OUR NORTH OR NORTHEAST UNTIL AT LEAST LATE
SUNDAY...THEN SLIDES OFF TO THE E TO SE...AND MAY ALLOW A WEAK
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW BY EARLY NEXT WEEK.

THIS TYPICAL SUMMERTIME PATTERN DOES NOT SUPPORT MORE THAN ISOLATED 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTION THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WHICH WAS 
ALREADY DEPICTED IN OUR FORECAST. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW PRECIPITABLE 
WATER INCREASING BY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...SO I NUDGED POPS UP 
TO LOW CHANCE IN MOST AREAS FOR MONDAY. THIS WAS ALSO THE TREND FROM 
18/12Z GFSX TO 19/00Z GFSX MOS POPS. NO CHANGES MADE FOR TUESDAY 
WITH CHANCE POPS DAYTIME AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NIGHTTIME SUFFICIENT 
FOR NOW. 

FOR TEMPS...GFS AND GFSX MOS TEMPS GENERALLY FOLLOWED...EXCEPT FOR 
STAYING MOSTLY BELOW THE 90S FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...GIVEN THE FALLING 
HEIGHTS AND INCREASING MOISTURE.

WON'T BE THE EASIEST THING TIMING THE BANDS OF PRECIP AS THEY ROLE

ON THE TIMING OF THE PRECIP DEPARTURE LATE TUESDAY...THE GFS IS
QUICKEST...BUT HAVE LEANED TOWARD THE SLIGHTLY SLOWER SOLUTIONS OF
THE NAM/CANADIAN/ECMWF...THUS TUES EVENING POPS ARE A LITTLE HIGHER

DRY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED
TO OUR EAST AND UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD IN FOR FRIDAY THROUGH

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS PERFORMED RATHER POORLY ON 
THE BATCH OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS THAT MOVED ACROSS NE 
PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA AROUND MIDNIGHT TO 330 AM EDT. APPEARS 
THAT THERE WILL BE AT LEAST A FEW HOURS LAG BEFORE MORE CONVECTION 
MOVES IN FROM THE WEST AFTER SUNRISE. ALREADY SEEING EVIDENCE OF 
THIS CONVECTION UPSTREAM OVER MIDDLE TN AND NE AL...SO AT LEAST 
SOMEWHAT CONFIDENT IN INCREASING POPS FOR LATER THIS MORNING. 
SOUNDINGS ARE MORE UNSTABLE THIS MORNING THAN LATER TODAY...SO ADDED 
AT LEAST A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS. LOWERED POPS GENERALLY TO 
CHANCE NORTH...BUT KEPT LIKELY POPS OVER SE TN AND SW NC. THIS IS IN 
LINE WITH NAM MODEL DEPICTION AND ALSO NEEDED TO BLEND BETTER WITH 
FFC AND GSP FORECAST GRIDS. 

FOR TONIGHT...FRONTAL BOUNDARY SEEMS TO FINALLY SAG FURTHER SOUTH BY 
12Z TUESDAY...WITH GENERAL CONSENSUS AMONGST MODELS ON THE NEXT 
MAJOR WAVE OF CONVECTION APPROACHING LIKELY IN THE 06Z TO 12Z 
TUESDAY PERIOD. FORECAST SOUNDINGS LOOK MORE UNSTABLE THAN EARLIER 
THOUGHT...AS WELL AS SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY AFTER 06Z TUESDAY. 
THUS...I HAVE POPS INCREASING AFTER 06Z TUESDAY WITH SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS MENTIONED. 

FOR TEMPS...JUST DON'T SEE MAX TEMPS GETTING NEAR THE GFS MOS VALUES 
GIVEN THE ONGOING AND DEVELOPING CONVECTION. TRENDED CLOSE TO THE 
PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID...WHICH WAS VERY CLOSE TO THE COOLER NAM MOS 
HIGHS. MOS MINS LOOKED FINE FOR TONIGHT AND WERE FOLLOWED.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS STILL BRINGING MAJOR
SHORTWAVE INTO FORECAST AREA TUESDAY AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. THIS WILL
AFFECT HIGHS WITH SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TUESDAY MORNING
DECREASING IN THE AFTERNOON. KEPT HIGHS BELOW GUIDANCE WITH
CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION. MODELS STILL HAVE FRONT
MOVING SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT OR EARLY WEDNESDAY.
STILL WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY TO TRIGGER MORE ISOLATED SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. PATTERN OF SLIGHT
CHANCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE THROUGH THE END OF
THE WEEK AS THE TROUGH STAYS OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY.
DRIER AND COOLER AIR BEHIND BOUNDARY WILL KEEP HIGHS NEAR TO
SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL WITH DEEPER MOISTURE STAYING SOUTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA. MODELS TRY TO STRENGTHEN RIDGE TO THE WEST AND GFS
TRIES TO DEVELOP WEAK UPPER LOW ALONG SOUTHEAST COAST ON THE
WEEKEND. THIS COULD INCREASE POPS OVER EASTERN SECTIONS BUT WILL
KEEP 20 TO 30 PERCENT AFTERNOON AND EVENING POPS FOR SATURDAY AND
SUNDAY.

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODE CHANGE NOW UNDERWAY AS 
WE TRANSITION BACK TO A WETTER PERIOD FOR THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS.  
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THIS AFTERNOON AND THIS EVENING...WEAK 
DISTURBANCE IS MOVING ACROSS THE AREA...AND IT WILL BE FOLLOWED LATE 
THIS EVENING BY ANOTHER DISTURBANCE ROTATING THROUGH FROM THE 
NORTHWEST.  SO THERE ARE A COUPLE OF TIMES FOR SLIGHTLY ENHANCED 
LIFT IN THIS FIRST PERIOD.  FOR MONDAY...MOISTURE HANGS IN THE 
AREA...WITH DEEPER MOISTURE AND MORE LIFT ACROSS THE SOUTH...SO 
HIGHER POPS THERE.  FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...PRECIP CHANCES 
REMAIN HIGH AS MOISTURE CONTINUES TO STREAM INTO THE AREA.  LOOKING 
AT MODEL SOUNDINGS...CAPE VALUES APPEAR LOW FOR MUCH OF THE 
TIME...EVEN LOOKING LIKE PLAIN RAIN AT TIMES.  IN GRIDS WENT WITH A 
CHANCE OF THUNDER THIS EVENING...THEN JUST SHOWERS FOR THE REST OF 
THE TIME THROUGH TUESDAY.  FOR TEMPERATURES...WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE 
FOR LOWS...ALTHOUGH BUMPED UP KTRI A COUPLE OF DEGREES MONDAY 
NIGHT...BUT FOR HIGHS...WENT ON THE COOL SIDE OF GUIDANCE AS CLOUDS 
AND RAIN WILL SUPPRESS HEATING.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A GENERALLY ZONAL 
PATTERN REMAINS IN VIEW TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH A 
MOSTLY DIURNAL CONVECTIVE REGIME. BEGINNING THURSDAY...UPPER LEVEL 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD OVER TX/AR AND BUILD THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
THIS WILL PUT US UNDER A NW FLOW ALOFT WHICH LEAVES US VULNERABLE TO 
MCS ACTIVITY TOPPING THE RIDGE FROM THE OH VALLEY. BUT THE MODELS 
STRUGGLE TO IDENTIFY ANY CASE IN PARTICULAR...THE CANADIAN MODEL 
SUGGESTS W TN ON FRI WHILE ECMWF SUGGESTS E TN LATER SATURDAY. THIS 
PARTICULAR THREAT WILL BE HARD TO PIN DOWN THIS FAR AWAY. THUS A

OPTED NOT TO GO WITH A TEMPO FOR KTYS AND KTRI OVERNIGHT.
HOWEVER...SOUTHERN AREAS HAVE BETTER CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION ON

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LITTLE CHANGE THIS MORNING FROM

SURFACE RIDGE WILL BE SLIPPING OFF TO THE EAST...ALLOWING A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE/INSTABILITY FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. THE MOISTURE DEEPENS BY TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...AS THE 
UPPER RIDGE ALSO FLATTENS. PREVIOUS WEATHER AND POP GRIDS LOOKED 
GOOD WITH GENERALLY NO RAIN CHANCES THROUGH ABOUT 16Z TODAY...THEN 
CHANCE POPS (OR SCATTERED WORDING) THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 

JUST MINOR CHANGES MADE...SUCH AS SLIGHTLY LOWERING POPS AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT FOR SOME LINGERING SHOWERS...WHICH COULD END.
PARTIAL CLEARING...IN ANY AREAS THAT DO RECEIVE RAINFALL...SHOULD 
LEAD TO PATCHY AREAS OF FOG LATE. 

FOR TEMPS...THE INCREASING MOISTURE AND DECREASING HEIGHTS ALOFT 
DON'T FAVOR THE WARMER GFS MAX TEMPS...SO I TRENDED CLOSER TO THE 
COOLER NAM/MET MOS MAXES. MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT WERE CLOSELY 
FOLLOWED.

THE THREAT OF STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE STORMS REMAINS VERY LOW
AT THIS TIME.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MOISTURE HAS INCREASED
SUBSTANTIALLY FROM SUNDAY WITH BROAD TROUGH SETTLING OVER EASTERN
HALF OF THE COUNTRY. CONSIDERABLE CLOUD COVER AND MUCH HIGHER RAIN
CHANCES MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY AHEAD OF WEAK COLD FRONT. FOLLOWED
CLOSER TO LOWER MET VALUES FOR HIGHS MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND
MET/MOS BLEND FOR LOW ON TUE MORNING. WEAK DISTURBANCES IN FLOW
WILL SET OFF PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. SOME MAY BECOME
STRONG DURING LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS IF THERE IS ENOUGH
HEATING BUT NO CLEAR TRIGGER FOR SEVERE STORMS AT THIS TIME.
RAINFALL AMOUNTS MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING MAY BECOME HEAVY
BUT AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE LESS THAN 2 INCHES. FRONT MOVES JUST

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

332 PM EDT SAT JUN 15 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...THIS FORECASTS STARTS 
WITH QUIET WEATHER...THE UPPER RIDGE OVERHEAD...BUT THE SURFACE 
RIDGE HAS NOW MOVED EAST OF THE AREA ALLOWING THE RETURN FLOW OF 
MOIST AIR TO BEGIN.  TRAJECTORY FORECASTS SHOW THE SOURCE REGION FOR 
OUR AIR MASS ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON IS PRESENTLY RESIDING IN THE 
SOUTHERN HALVES OF GA/AL WHERE DEW POINTS ARE 60-65 SRN GA...BUT 65-70 
IN SRN AL.  WOULD EXPECT DEWPOINTS IN OUR AREA BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON 
TO RANGE FROM THE LOWER 60S IN THE NORTHEAST TO UPPER 60S SOUTHWEST. 
THIS RESULTS IN MLCAPE VALUES OF ABOUT 500-1000 J/KG...SO STORMS NOT 
EXPECTED TO GET OVERLY STRONG. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW TALL/SKINNY CAPE 
ON ALL SOUNDINGS.  WITH THIS BEING SAID...THERE IS A WEAK UPPER 
LEVEL DISTURBANCE MOVING THROUGH THE AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON...SO 
ALTHOUGH CAPES WILL BE MARGINAL...THIS DISTURBANCE COULD HELP 
ORGANIZE THE CONVECTION AND HELP ADD A LITTLE LIFT.  ALSO...THERE IS 
A SECOND WAVE THAT ROTATES THROUGH OVERNIGHT.  WILL GO WITH 
NON-SEVERE THUNDER IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AND SHOWERS AFTER 
MIDNIGHT.  WENT ON HIGHER SIDE OF MOS IN GENERAL FOR THESE POPS.
MOS TEMPS AND DEW POINTS LOOKED PRETTY GOOD--WENT VERY CLOSE. ANY 
FOG OVERNIGHT TONIGHT...THINK IT WOULD BE PATCHY AND NOT OVERLY 
THICK DUE TO INCREASING CLOUDS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A FAIRLY ZONAL PATTERN WITH 
DISTURBANCES AND WIGGLES WILL KEEP THE AREA UNDER A REGIME OF 
OCCASIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY AND TUESDAY. FRONTAL 
PASSAGE WILL THEN SCOUR OUT THE BULK OF THE ACTIVITY BY WEDNESDAY 
ALTHOUGH MODELS DISAGREE JUST HOW FAR SOUTH THE BOUNDARY AND PRECIP 
WILL PUSH THROUGH...MAYBE MAINTAINING CHC POPS IN OUR FAR SOUTH 
WEDNESDAY. MOSTLY GOING TO MAINTAIN AN AFTERNOON AND EVENING 
CONVECTIVE REGIME FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK...WITH POPS MAINLY 
IN THE 20-30 PCT RANGE. HIGH PRESSURE ALOFT WILL BE BUILDING OVER 
TX/AR LATE IN THE WEEK...AND FLATTENING EASTWARD INTO OUR REGION BY 
DAY 9. THUS EXPECT A WARMING TREND DURING THE LATE PORTION OF THE 
EXTENDED...AND THEN BEYOND. ONE DISTANT PROBLEM TO BEAR IN MIND IS 
THAT AS THE UPPER RIDGE BUILDS OVER TX/AR...IT OPENS US UP TO NW 
FLOW TYPE MCS ACTIVITY...GFS AND ESPECIALLY DGEX HINT AT THAT FOR 
NEXT SATURDAY. WON/T BITE ON THAT YET FOR A DAY 7 FORECAST...BUT 
KEEP AN EYE OPEN.

THERE WILL BE AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE MOVING TOWARD THE AREA AT

OF THE ELEVATED TERRAIN ON THE PLATEAU...IT LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL

BE MOVING THIS WAY. HOWEVER...IN GENERAL THE ARRIVAL IS EXPECTED TO
BE AFTER THE END OF THIS FORECAST. HAVE ONLY INCLUDED VCTS AT KCHA
FOR LAST COUPLE OF HOURS. LASTLY HAVE INCLUDED 4SM BR AT KTRI.
DEPENDING ON CLOUD COVER...THIS COULD BE HIGHER OR LOWER...LESS
CLOUDS FOR THICKER FOG...AND MORE CLOUDS FOR LESS FOG. RIGHT NOW

TODAY WITH ANOTHER MOSTLY CLEAR AND SEASONABLY WARM DAY ON TAP. GFS 
MOS MAX TEMPS LOOKED VERY GOOD AND ALLOW FOR A FEW DEGREES WARMER 
FROM FRIDAY'S HIGHS.

GENERALLY INCREASES OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT MID AND HIGH CLOUDS 
WON'T INCREASE UNTIL SUNDAY...AS THE UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO FLATTEN.

FLATTENS OUT AND SHIFTS EAST SUNDAY AS IMPULSE MOVES ACROSS EASTERN
GREAT LAKES AND UPPER OHIO VALLEY. TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY INTO
LOWER OHIO VALLEY AND MS VALLEY WILL MOVE INTO THE EASTERN TN

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT/...
IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT AND STORMS THAT MOVED THROUGH THE REGION
YESTERDAY...A CALM AND DRY DAY HAS PREVAILED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES PEAKING IN THE UPPER
70S TO MID 80S IN MOST AREAS. FOR TONIGHT...A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE
WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD IN...RESULTING IN CONTINUED CLEAR AND DRY
CONDITIONS FOR THE DAY ON SATURDAY AS WELL. SOME FOG DEVELOPMENT
WILL BE POSSIBLE LATE TONIGHT IN THE USUAL FOG-PRONE POCKETS AND
NEAR BODIES OF WATER. AFTER SUNRISE HOWEVER...ANY FOG WILL
DISSIPATE QUICKLY AND WINDS WILL VEER TO THE SOUTHWEST...
RESULTING IN SUNNY AND WARMER CONDITIONS IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S
ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEYS...WITH LOWER 80S ACROSS THE
NORTHEAST ZONES.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY/...
THE SOUTHEAST RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO PROGRESS EASTWARD WHILE A 
TROUGH DROPS INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER MS VALLEY REGION ON 
SUNDAY. WITH THE RIDGE WEAKENING...WE SHOULD SEE SOME SCATTERED TO 
ISOLATED STORMS SUNDAY AFTERNOON...AS WELL AS INCREASING MOISTURE 
WITH PW VALUES RISING ABOVE 1.5 INCHES. CONDITIONS APPEAR FAVORABLE 
FOR MCS DEVELOPMENT IN THE IA/MO/IL AREA ON SUNDAY...AND THE NAM 
BRINGS THE REMNANT VORT MAX OF THIS SYSTEM INTO OUR NORTHERN AREAS 
SUNDAY NIGHT. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. 

THE UPPER TROUGH/JET STREAK MOVE INTO THE LOWER GREAT LAKES/OHIO 
VALLEY ON MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT...WHICH WILL INCREASE LIFT ACROSS THE 
AREA. WITH REASONABLE AGREEMENT AMONG MODELS AND ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ON 
THIS TIMING...WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS FOR BOTH PERIODS. TIMING OF 
BEST LIFT AT NIGHT DOES NOT FAVOR SEVERE STORMS...AND THE BEST 
DIVERGENCE IN THE JET ENTRANCE REGION STAYS TO OUR NORTH. THERE MAY 
BE A THREAT OF SEVERE MONDAY AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY IF THE SYSTEM IS 
A BIT FASTER THAN THE MODELS CURRENTLY SHOW. CHANCE POPS LINGER INTO 
TUESDAY MORNING AS THE SYSTEM DEPARTS. 

WEDNESDAY LOOKS DRY WITH A DEEP NW FLOW BEHIND THE TROUGH. THE GFS 
SHOWS A WEAK UPPER TROUGH OVER THE AREA THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...WHICH 
MAY SUPPORT DIURNAL SCATTERED TO ISOLATED STORMS BOTH DAYS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CLEAR SKIES AND FALLING DEW 
POINT TEMPS NOTED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. LIGHT

DEVELOPMENT THUS FAR. MOS MAX TEMPS QUITE CLOSE AND GENERALLY IN 
LINE WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS...WITH AMPLE SUNSHINE TO REACH AS WARM AS 
MID TO UPPER 80S ACROSS SRN AREAS.

MOSTLY CLEAR TONIGHT WITH LIGHT WINDS AS THE SURFACE RIDGE SETTLES 
OVER THE CENTRAL AND SRN APPALACHIANS. THIS SCENARIO FAVORS PATCHY 
AREAS OF FOG...ESPECIALLY FOR FAVORED SPOTS SUCH AS TRI AND RHP.
SIMILAR MOS MINS WERE VERY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS MIN TEMP GRID...AND 
QUITE PLEASANT FOR MID JUNE FROM AROUND 50 TO LOWER 60S.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WITH
DRIER AIR MASS AND WARMING TEMPERATURES WILL PREVAIL SATURDAY.
RIDGING ALOFT STRENGTHENS OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES AS WELL.
TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY WARMER SOUTH AND MUCH WARMER NORTH AS RIDGE
STRENGTHENS. FLOW STILL OUT OF THE NW SATURDAY AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY
AHEAD OF COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. SATURDAY NIGHT AND
SUNDAY RIDGE FLATTENS OUT AND HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST ALLOWING
FOR MOISTURE RETURN INTO THE THE TN VALLEY. SLIGHT CHANCE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY AS WEAK TROUGH IN THE NEAR ZONAL
FLOW. RAIN CHANCES INCREASE MONDAY TO LIKELY AND CONTINUE TUESDAY
AHEAD OF NEXT SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT. THIS FRONT SHOULD SHIFT
SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. WEDNESDAY STILL LOOKS
DRY AS FRONT STAYS SOUTH OF THE REGION. THE FRONT THEN BECOMES
STATIONARY BY THURSDAY WITH MOISTURE RETURNING BACK NORTH DURING

SHOWERS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK

.SHORT TERM...
CURRENTLY TWO LINES MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. THE LINE
FARTHEST WEST IS ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. THERE ARE SOME
WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS DEVELOPING ACROSS NORTH/NORTHEAST
KY/WV IN THE VICINITY OF THE COLD POOL ALOFT. HAVE LEFT SLIGHT
CHANCE OF SHOWERS INTO THE MID EVENING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS.
OTHERWISE MUCH DRIER AND RELATIVELY COOLER AIR WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
REGION OVERNIGHT. FORECAST MODEL SOUNDINGS DIFFER WITH THEIR
HANDLING OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TOMORROW AT THE 850MB HEIGHT. THE
NAM IS NEARLY SATURATED WHILE THE GFS IS MUCH DRIER. USUALLY THE
NAM HANDLES THE VERTICAL LEVELS BETTER BUT WITH A DRY AIR MASS
FILLING IN BEHIND THE TROUGH AND THE EASTERN EDGE OF THE RIDGE
BRINGING SINKING AIR...FIND IT HARD TO BUY MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES
SHORTLY AFTER NOON. IN THE WAKE OF THE FRONT...DAYTIME TEMPERATURES
WILL BE PLEASANT GENERALLY LOWER TO MID 80S.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...AT THE BEGINNING OF
THIS PERIOD...HIGH PRESSURE HAS BUILT INTO THE REGION AT THE
SURFACE AND THE UPPER RIDGE CENTERED OVER TX IS TRYING TO BUILD
INTO THE REGION AS WELL. BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...THE SURFACE HIGH HAS
MOVED TO THE EAST ALLOWING A RETURN FLOW TO SET UP...AND THE RIDGE
HAS BEEN FLATTENED BY A DISTURBANCE. SURFACE DEWPOINTS WILL BE BACK
INTO THE 60S AREA-WIDE BY THEN...AND THE FIRST CHANCE OF
SHOWERS/STORMS COMES BACK INTO THE AREA. CHANCES OF SHOWERS/STORMS
CONTINUE THROUGH MONDAY...THEN TAPERS OFF SOMEWHAT BY TUESDAY.
SEVERE THUNDERSTORM CHANCES LOOK TO BE WELL WEST OF OUR AREA.

FINALLY BY WEDNESDAY...DRY AIR MOVES INTO THE REGION AND THE 
FORECAST IS DRY FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD.

FOR TEMPERATURES...MODEL GUIDANCE SEEMS GOOD OVERALL...WENT CLOSE 
TO GUIDANCE FOR MOST PERIODS.

THE AIR MASS OVER THE AREA REMAINS MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH PLENTY

POTENTIAL FOR STRONG TO SEVERE WIND GUSTS FROM THE THUNDERSTORMS.  
AS FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER INTO THE EARLY EVENING BUT MUCH OF THE

WEAKENING TREND OVER THE PAST HOUR. I DID NOTE THAT THE LATEST RUC 
MODEL ALSO SPREADS THIS ACTIVITY ACROSS SW VA IN THE 09Z TO 12Z 
PERIOD. BASED ON LATEST SATELLITE AND RADAR TRENDS...I FEEL THAT 
CURRENT POP AND WEATHER GRIDS LOOK ON TRACK WITH JUST SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR SW VA AND NE TN LATE TONIGHT.

LOOKS LIKE AN INCREASE IN MID AND HIGH CLOUDS AT LEAST FROM

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE 
SOUTH CENTRAL STATES AND STRETCHING EAST INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
HAS KEPT THINGS WARM AND DRY THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
WEAK DEW POINT BOUNDARY OR FRONT LIES ALONG THE SOUTHERN BORDER WITH 
LOWER DEW POINTS NORTH. HEAT INDEX VALUES HAVE REACHED ABOVE 90 
AROUND CHA TODAY WITH DEW POINTS AROUND 70. AIR MASS IS VERY 
UNSTABLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS BUT NO TRIGGER FOR CONVECTION 
TODAY.

MODELS DIFFER TONIGHT WITH OVERNIGHT CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALONG THE 
PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE AND MOVING SE TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA. GFS 
KEEPING ACTIVITY TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA AND NAM SHOWING ACTIVITY 
DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND MOVING SE INTO SW VA 
AND NE TN LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. NAM PUTS RAIN CHANCES AS 
HIGH AS 30 TO 40 PERCENT ACROSS NE PART OF THE REGION TONIGHT AND 40 
TO 50 PERCENT WEDNESDAY AS ACTIVITY CONTINUES TO DROP SOUTH AND 
WEST. HAVE COMPROMISED AND ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE LATE TONIGHT NE AND 
INCREASED POPS TO CHANCE NE BETWEEN 12 AND 18Z WEDNESDAY WITH SLIGHT 
CHANCE LATER. AS FOR TEMPERATURES SOME LATE NIGHT CLOUDS COULD HOLD 
TEMPERATURES UP CLOSER TO MET NUMBERS. WEDNESDAY GUIDANCE STILL 
RUNNING TO HIGH AT FOR SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL AREAS. WITH SOME CLOUDS 
AND SHOWERS...KEPT HIGHS CLOSER TO MET GUIDANCE BUT SLIGHTLY WARMER 
NE AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AT CHA WITH 92. IT STILL HAS NOT REACHED 90 
AT CHA THIS YEAR ALTHOUGH IT COULD TODAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL TWO COLD FRONTS AFFECTING THE FORECAST 
AREA...ONE ON THURSDAY AND THE OTHER ONE EARLY NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
NATION ON THURSDAY...WHICH WILL PUSH A COLD FRONT QUICKLY THROUGH A 
MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE NOW 
REVEALING A LITTLE FASTER EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS COLD FRONT ON 
THURSDAY...WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION MOVING INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY MORNING. A FAIRLY STRONG WIND FLOW WITH 
THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD HELP TO PRODUCE SOME SEVERE STORMS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN BUILD OVER THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR THE WEEKEND...BUT WITH NORTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT LINGERING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS PATTERN WILL BE 
CONDUCIVE FOR CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES FROM THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY TO 
MOVE SOUTHEASTWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY AS ANOTHER COLD FRONT SLOWLY APPROACHES 
THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST. THUS...WILL MENTION CHANCE 
POPS FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH TUESDAY...WITH A VERY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP EACH DAY OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...SINCE THIS IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH 
THE ENSEMBLE MEANS AND THE GROUND REMAINS FAIRLY WET OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SKIES HAVE BECOME PARTLY CLOUDY 
THIS AFTERNOON BEHIND MORNING DISTURBANCE AND AIR MASS HAS BECOME 
UNSTABLE ENOUGH AHEAD OF UPPER LEVEL LOW/TROUGH MOVING EAST ACROSS 
THE OHIO AND MS VALLEYS THAT A NEW AREA OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
WAS PROGRESSING TOWARDS THE NASHVILLE AND ADJACENT MIDDLE TN AND 
MIDDLE KY REGION. WITH SLIGHTLY LOWER FREEZING LEVEL AND STRONG WIND 
SHEAR LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS ARE POSSIBLE LATE THIS AFTERNOON 
THROUGH MID EVENING AS THE STORMS MOVE EAST. SUPERCELLS COULD FORM 
EARLY IN THE PERIOD AND MOVE INTO THE PLATEAU COUNTIES WITH AN 
ISOLATED TORNADO POSSIBLE. RAISED POPS SLIGHTLY TO LIKELY ALL OF 
EAST TN AND SW VA INTO THE EVENING HOURS AND ADDED SEVERE WORDING. 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS A POSSIBILITY WITH CURRENT WET GROUND BUT 
EXPECTING STORMS TO MOVE FAST ENOUGH THAT THE FLOOD THREAT WILL BE 
ISOLATED. DRIER AIR MASS WORKS IN TONIGHT AND TUESDAY BUT WITH 
EVENING RAIN PATCHY DENSE FOG POSSIBLE TUESDAY MORNING. LOWS TONIGHT 
SHOULD BE CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE NEAR 60 HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO MID 60S 
AROUND CHA. TUESDAY A FEW DEGREES WARMER BUT KEPT A FEW DEGREES 
BELOW GUIDANCE DUE TO THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN THE GROUND THAT HAS 
TO EVAPORATE BEFORE TEMPS REACH THE 90 DEGREE THRESHOLD.    

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL TWO MAIN FEATURES AFFECTING THE 
FORECAST AREA...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ON THURSDAY AND A COLD FRONT 
ON MONDAY. A VERY UNSTABLE AIR MASS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY...WITH ISOLATED CONVECTION EXPECTED 
DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. ANOTHER VERY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AGAIN ON THURSDAY...AS A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY PUSHES A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. WITH VERY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASSES EXPECTED ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...IT APPEARS THAT SEVERE 
CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE EACH DAY...BUT ESPECIALLY ON THURSDAY AS 
THE COLD FRONT TRIGGERS A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. HIGH 
PRESSURE THEN BUILDS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR THE WEEKEND...WITH 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT LINGERING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
IT APPEARS THAT THIS PATTERN WILL BE CONDUCIVE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF 
MCS ACTIVITY MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST...BUT 
WILL KEEP THE FORECAST DRY UNTIL LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...WHEN A 
WEAK UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH PUSHES A COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE FORECAST 
AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...SINCE THIS IS IN

BRIEF PERIODS OF HEAVY RAIN ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS.
THIS AREA WILL MOVE OUT OF THE REGION BY EARLY AFTERNOON WITH SKIES

BEST CHANCE OF SEVERE WILL BE BETWEEN 21 AND 3Z. HIGH WINDS AND
HAIL THE MAIN THREATS ALTHOUGH SUPERCELLS COULD FORM ON THE
SOUTHERN END OF THE ACTIVITY SEE SPC DAY ONE OUTLOOK. ALSO WITH THE
HEAVY RAINFALL IN PARTS OF THE AREA THE LAST FEW DAYS LOCALIZED
FLOODING COULD RESULT IN AREAS OF PROLONGED HEAVY RAIN. HAVE
ADJUSTED HOURLY TEMPERATURES DOWN BECAUSE OF THE RAIN AND SHAVED A

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE 
THROUGH TODAY...AND AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WILL SWING ACROSS THE AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON INTO TONIGHT.  A BAND OF CONVECTION TO OUR WEST AHEAD 
OF THE WEAK FRONT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA MAINLY THIS 
MORNING INTO EARLY AFTERNOON.  MAY BE A BREAK BEFORE ADDITIONAL 
CONVECTION FIRES AS THE UPPER TROUGH MOVES IN.  LOOKS LIKE ENOUGH 
SUNSHINE WILL BE AROUND BEHIND INITIAL CONVECTION TO ALLOW DECENT 
DESTABILIZATION...AND WITH COOLING ALOFT WITH THE TROUGH THERE MAY 
BE SOME STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING WITH 
HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS THE PRIMARY THREATS.  WITH HIGH PW VALUES 
THIS MORNING AND GROUND ALREADY ON THE WET SIDE IN SOME 
AREAS...LOCALIZED FLOODING ALSO POSSIBLE. THREAT DOES NOT APPEAR TO 
BE WIDESPREAD ENOUGH FOR ANY FLOOD WATCH AT THIS POINT.  WILL 
MENTION LOCALIZED FLOOD THREAT AND SEVERE THREAT IN HWO.  MAV TEMPS 
LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...EASTERN U.S. UPPER TROUGH WILL 
BE MOVING AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY ALLOWING 
FOR A PERIOD OF RISING HEIGHTS ALONG WITH SOME DRYING. A MASSIVE 
UPPER LEVEL HIGH PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL TRY TO EXTEND EAST FROM THE 
PLAINS ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION DURING THE LONG 
TERM PERIOD BUT WILL BE SUPPRESSED TO SOME DEGREE AS SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY RIDES OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE. THE MODELS GENERATE THE 
THUNDERSTORM COMPLEXES WELL NORTHWEST OF THE REGION AND SHIP THEM 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IN THE PREVAILING 
NORTHWEST FLOW ON THE EDGE OF THE RIDGE. MODEL SOLUTIONS CONTINUE TO 
HINT AT THE POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY WITH ONE OF THESE 
SYSTEMS SO APPLIED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP HERE. IT LOOKS LIKE A BETTER 
CHANCE FOR MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION WILL OCCUR THURSDAY INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT WITH A MORE WELL DEVELOPED SYSTEM WHICH THE MODELS 
HAVE BEEN KEYING ON FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS. AFTER THE PASSAGE OF 
THIS SHORT WAVE AND COOL FRONT THE MID AMERICA UPPER LEVEL RIDGE MAY 
BE ABLE TO MAKE INROADS INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. ALLOWING FOR A 
DRY AND WARM END TO THE WEEK. THE PRECIP FREE WEEKEND MAY BE 
INTERRUPTED BY YET ANOTHER MCS WHICH THE MODELS TRY TO BRING ACROSS 
THE MIDWEST AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY. FORECAST CONFIDENCE 
AT THIS REMOTE PERIOD IS RATHER LOW SO JUST USED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP 
FOR CONVECTION AT THIS TIME. TEMPERATURE FORECAST IS INTERESTING 
WITH THE GUIDANCE REALLY GOING THERMONUCLEAR WITH MAXIMUMS ON 
WEDNESDAY. WENT MUCH CLOSER TO THE COOLER MET MOS TEMPS FOR 
WEDNESDAY WHILE TRENDING CLOSE TO THE REMAINING MEX GUIDANCE 
SUGGESTIONS FOR MAXES. MIN TEMP GUIDANCE LOOKED REASONABLE IF NOT A 
COUPLE DEGREES TOO COOL IN SPOTS WITH THE BUILDING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE 
AND THE APPROACHING SOLSTICE SO WARMED UP THE MINS JUST A TAD.

.DISCUSSION...
LATEST FORECAST REMAINS ON TRACK. ONLY CHANGE WAS TO MENTION
ISOLATED THUNDER AFTER 6Z. THE LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS
OVER WEST TN WILL CONTINUE TO MARCH EAST AHEAD OF THE UPPER TROUGH.
SHOWERS WILL WEAKEN AS THEY MOVE INTO E TN AND MAY EVEN BREAK APART
HOWEVER MOST LOCATIONS WILL HAVE EXCELLENT CHANCES OF GETTING
MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION OVERNIGHT IN THIS MOIST ENVIRONMENT.
WHERE IT RAINS...AMOUNTS WILL ADD UP QUICKLY. NOT ANTICIPATING
WIDESPREAD FLASH FLOODING ISSUES DUE TO THE A FASTER MOVING SYSTEM.
HOWEVER THERE IS A CHANCE OF A FEW LOCATIONS GETTING MORE RAIN THAN
NEEDED. 

RAIN CHANCES DIMINISH STARTING SHORTLY AFTER SUNRISE AND CONTINUE
TO LESSEN THROUGH THE DAY TOMORROW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)... A SOUPY AIR MASS
WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA THROUGH TONIGHT AS A DEEP FLOW OF GULF
MOISTURE PERSISTS AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING TROUGH OVER THE MIDWEST.
TONIGHT...LIFT WILL BE PROVIDED BY LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE AND
FRONTOGENESIS. WITH WARM CLOUD LAYER DEPTH OF 3500-4000M AND PW
VALUES IN THE 1.75 TO 2 INCH RANGE...WHICH IS WELL ABOVE CLIMO
NORMALS...FLOODING IS A CONCERN ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF
THE AREA. WITH THE HIGH FREEZING LEVEL...HAIL IS NOT TOO MUCH OF A
CONCERN...AND SO FAR THERE HAS BEEN VERY LITTLE LIGHTNING SEEN WITH
THE CURRENT SHOWER ACTIVITY. SOME WIND GUSTS MAY OCCUR WITH THE
STRONGEST STORMS. POPS WILL BE CATEGORICAL OVERNIGHT...WITH A
MENTION OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN SOUTH AND WEST.

THE CLOSED UPPER LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE OH VALLEY TOMORROW...WITH A 
VORT MAX TRAILING ACROSS OUR AREA. DIVERGENCE WITH AN UPPER JET 
STREAK WILL ALSO HELP PROVIDE SOME LIFT...AND CAPE WILL BE IN THE 
1000-1500 J/KG RANGE. WE MAY GET SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS IN THE 
AFTERNOON TO HELP DESTABILIZATION...SO SEVERE POTENTIAL LOOKS A 
LITTLE BETTER THAN TODAY. WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON. WITH THE TROUGH AXIS PASSING THROUGH...DRY AIR ALOFT WILL 
BE BUILDING IN FROM THE WEST...AND POPS WILL BE DECREASING
OVERNIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS MAINLY IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS EXPECTED TUESDAY MORNING AS THE LOW MOVES NORTH 
INTO CANADA. MOISTURE WITH THIS LOW WILL PROGRESS NORTH...LEAVING 
THE AREA WITH CLEARING SKIES AND WARMING TEMPS. HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE MID WEST WILL SLOWLY WORK ITS WAY INTO THE AREA BEGINNING 
TUESDAY. KEPT TEMPS WELL BELOW GUIDANCE TUESDAY AND WED. MID AND 
HIGH CLOUDS WILL REMAIN THROUGH WEDNESDAY PREVENTING SIGNIFICANT HEATING 
THROUGH THE DAY. 

FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE AROUND 
THE HIGH...BRINGING THE POSSIBILITY OF RAIN TO NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. MODELS HAVE BEEN DISAGREEING ON THIS 
TIMING...SO CONFIDENCE LOW. CONFIDENCE DOES INCREASE FOR THURSDAY AS 
THE SHORTWAVE INCREASES RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE REST OF THE AREA 
THROUGH THE DAY. DUE TO UPPER LEVEL FORCING AND THE CAPE 
AVAILABLE...HAVE INCLUDED THUNDER IN THE FORECAST. SOUNDING DOES NOT 
LOOK TOO IMPRESSIVE FOR STRONG DEVELOPMENT AND SHEAR IS VERY MINIMAL 
THROUGH THE DAY...SO DONT EXPECT ANYTHING SEVERE AT THIS POINT. RAINFALL 
WILL MOVE OUT OF THE REGION OVERNIGHT THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY AS THE 
HIGH PRESSURE PROGRESSES FURTHER EAST OVER THE REGION. FRIDAY INTO 
THE WEEKEND WILL REMAIN DRY...WITH GRADUAL WARMING TEMPS EACH DAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WARM FRONT ACROSS THE GULF
COAST STATES WILL LIFT NORTH TODAY WITH INCREASING GULF MOISTURE
OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY. AN UPPER
TROUGH OVER THE MID-WEST WILL MOVE EAST SOUTHEAST INTO THE LOWER
OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT AND MONDAY. MODELS SHOW THE TENNESSEE VALLEY A
COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT/MONDAY MORNING.
WIDESPREAD CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF
THE AREA TODAY AND AREA-WIDE OVERNIGHT. STRONG ACTIVITY WILL BE
ACROSS THE PLATEAU INTO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. 

GIVEN PWS NEAR THE 2 STANDARD DEVIATIONS ABOVE NORMAL..MODELS
SHOWING HIGH PRECIPITATION POTENTIAL PLACEMENT OVER THE WESTERN
TWO-THIRDS OF THE FOREACST AREA LATE TODAY AND TONIGHT...HAVE
INCLUDED LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL POSSIBLE. LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING
IS A CONCERN FOR THE PLATEAU INTO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE.

ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING...
BUT THE MAIN CONCERN IS FLOODING.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS BASICALLY AGREE ON THE 
LONG TERM SCENARIO WHICH BEGINS WITH AN AMPLIFIED LONG WAVE TROUGH 
AND ITS ASSOCIATED SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES ROTATING THROUGH THE 
MAIN CIRCULATION. STARTED OFF MONDAY MORNING WITH SOME LIKELY 
PROBABILITIES WITH A SYNOPTIC COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAKING ITS WAY 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. TRIED TO APPLY SOME HIGHER 
TIME RESOLUTION TO POPS WITH A GENERAL DECREASE THROUGH THE MORNING 
AS MODELS AGREE AXIS OF DEEPEST MOISTURE AND LIFT PUSH EAST INTO THE 
CAROLINAS. HOWEVER...ADJUSTED THE CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM BACK UP IN THE GRIDS LATER IN THE AFTERNOON AND THROUGH 
MONDAY NIGHT WHEN A FINAL SHORT WAVE DRIVES EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. NOT MUCH CHANCE FOR CONVECTION EXPECTED BEHIND THE MAJOR LONG 
WAVE TROUGH ON TUESDAY BUT HELD ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IF THE 
TRAILING DISTURBANCE IS A LITTLE SLOW TO DEPART. WAS ABLE TO 
MAINTAIN THE DRY PERIOD TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH SOME 
RIDGING AND DRIER WESTERLY FLOW BETWEEN SYSTEMS. MODEL AGREEMENT 
STILL NOTED LATER WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WITH ANOTHER 
RELATIVELY SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL 
SYSTEM. WENT AHEAD AND TWEAKED POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
FOR THIS SYSTEM TO GOOD CHANCE ON THURSDAY DUE TO CONVERGENCE OF 
MODEL OPINION. HELD ONTO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION 
NORTHEASTERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY FOR THE SMALL 
CHANCE THAT CONVECTION MAY DROP ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS IN 
THE NORTHWEST FLOW BEHIND THE DEPARTED UPPER TROUGH. HOWEVER MODELS 
CONTINUE TO BUILD A MASSIVE UPPER RIDGE FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE 
EASTERN STATES AT THE END OF THE LONG TERM FORECAST. THIS SCENARIO 
WOULD LEAD TO A VERY WARM AND DRY END TO THE WEEK. TRENDED 
TEMPERATURE FORECAST CLOSE TO BUT NOT QUITE A WARM AS MOS MAXES 
WHILE STAYING FAIRLY CLOSE TO MINS.

PREVENTING MUCH VERTICAL DEVELOPMENT. THERE COULD BE AN ISOLATED 
SHOWER TO TWO THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON...WHICH CAN BE 
HANDLED WITH NOWCASTS RATHER THAN ADDING POPS FOR THE EVENING GRIDS.

THE AFTERNOON CU FIELD SHOULD DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET...LEAVING MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES. SOME PATCHY FOG MAY DEVELOP...ESPECIALLY NEAR BODIES OF 
WATER. LATER TONIGHT...A VORT MAX NOW OVER LA WILL TRACK NE. THIS 
WILL BRING CLOUDS TO SOUTHERN AREAS AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH RAIN 
CHANCES SPREADING NORTHWARD TOWARD SUNRISE. A DEEP SOUTHERLY 
MOISTURE FEED AND A JET STREAK OVER MIDDLE TN WILL KEEP POPS GOING 
THROUGHOUT THE DAY. LIFT APPEARS WEAK BUT IT WILL NOT TAKE MUCH TO 
PRODUCE SHOWERS IN THE MOIST AND WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS. POPS WILL 
RANGE FROM HIGH CHANCE NORTH TO LIKELY CENTRAL AND SOUTH. WENT ON 
THE COOL SIDE FOR MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGH TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
EASTERN PLAINS TROUGH WILL BE TRANSLATING ACROSS THE MS AND OHIO 
RIVER VALLEYS THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. ABUNDANT MOISTURE AHEAD OF THIS 
TROUGH WILL ALLOW SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. ONCE THE THE TROUGH SWINGS EAST OF THE AREA...STABLE 
AIR WILL FOLLOW IN ITS WAKE ALONG WITH DECREASING RAIN CHANCES ON 
MONDAY NIGHT. TRIED TO ILLUSTRATE IN GRIDS THAT RAIN WILL GRADUALLY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE AREA THIS EVENING. 
SHOWERS ARE NOW DEVELOPING IN MIDDLE TN...AND THIS TREND WILL 
CONTINUE EASTWARD THROUGH MIDNIGHT. WILL HAVE CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS 
UNTIL THEN. THE VORT MAX LIFTS NE OF THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT...WHICH 
SHOULD END MOST POPS IN THE AREA. SATURDAY LOOKS DRIER AND MORE 
STABLE THAN THE PAST FEW DAYS...WITH PW VALUES IN THE MODELS FALLING 
TO AROUND 1 INCH AND MIDLEVEL TEMPS WARMING. THIS STABILIZATION 
ALONG WITH RISING HEIGHTS ALOFT SHOULD PREVENT CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT SATURDAY. WILL REMOVE ALL POPS FROM THE FORECAST. AFTER 
A CLOUD START TO THE DAY...THERE SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES IN THE 
AFTERNOON WITH HIGHS IN THE LOWER TO MID 80S IN MOST SPOTS. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
AT THE BEGINNING OF THIS PERIOD THE AREA WILL BE UNDER RATHER STABLE 
AIR AHEAD OF A SHORTWAVE OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS. BY SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON THE MODELS HINT ONCE AGAIN AT DESTABILIZATION AND 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. THE UPPER 
TROUGH WILL WOBBLE OVER THE NORTHERN MS VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT WHICH 
WILL INCREASE OUR RAIN CHANCES. AS THE UPPER LOW TRACKS OVER THE 
GREAT LAKES MONDAY NIGHT OUR BEST CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS WILL 
OCCUR ALONG A TRAILING COLD FRONT. CONFIDENCE IS ABOVE AVERAGE AS 
ALL MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT WITH TIMING AND INTENSITY. AS SUCH HAVE 
GONE WITH LIKELY POPS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EARLY MONDAY NIGHT. 

STABLE AIR SHOULD FILL IN BEHIND THE FRONT TUESDAY AND SLIGHT 
CHANCES OF RAIN PERSIST THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF NEXT WEEK AS WAVES 
IN THE NW FLOW...DEPENDING ON WHERE THEY TRACK COULD BRING US 
ADDITIONAL QPF BY LATE NEXT WEEK. CONFIDENCE OF PRECIP CHANCES AFTER 
TUESDAY IS LOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...REMAINS OF TROPICAL STORM
ANDREA WILL MOVE WELL EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA..HOWEVER..A
DEFORMATION ZONE WILL BE OVER THE FAR NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING PRODUCING A BAND OF RAIN. AN UPPER
TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AND
EVENING. MODELS SHOW A JET OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WITH DIVERGENCE
ALOFT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. GIVEN THE ABUNDANT MOISTURE
AND MARGINAL INSTABILITY...EXPECT WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. MAIN CONCERN WILL
BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL.

AFTER SUNSET..LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING AND WAVE MOVING EAST OF THE
AREA WILL ALLOW CONVECTION WILL DIMINISH THIS EVENING. MODELS SHOW
CLOUD COVER DECREASING AS WELL...BUT WET GROUND..CLEARING SKY AND
LIGHT/CALM WINDS WILL SET THE STAGE FOR AREAS OF FOG...SOME LOCALLY
DENSE FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...START OUT THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD WITH JUST A SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION FOR 
EASTERN AREAS AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY IS GRADUALLY LIFTING OUT FROM THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. USED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR AN 
ISOLATED SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ON SUNDAY WITH ENOUGH INSTABILITY 
PRESENT FOR DEVELOPMENT. MODELS CONTINUE TO TIME NEXT SIGNIFICANT 
SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM INTO THE REGION ON MONDAY 
SO KEPT A HIGH CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THIS 
PERIOD OF THE FORECAST TAPERING OFF TO A LOWER CHANCE RANGE MONDAY 
NIGHT AS COOL FRONT WORKS ITS WAY THROUGH THE AREA. NOT MUCH TO 
TRIGGER A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ON TUESDAY WITH DRY ADVECTION AND 
STABLE AIR BUILDING IN WITH RISING HEIGHTS SO LOWERED POP TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE HERE. THIS MAY BE ABLE TO BE TWEAKED BACK FURTHER IN LATER 
FORECASTS! AGAIN WEDNESDAY DOES NOT LOOK TOO THREATENING FOR 
CONVECTION AS THE REGION REMAINS GENERALLY IN BETWEEN MORE 
SIGNIFICANT WAVES BUT DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AT LONGER TIME RANGES IN 
THE CONVECTIVE SEASON KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN PLACE. NOTED SOME 
CONVERGENCE OF SOLUTIONS IN THE MODELS FOR THURSDAY WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER SHORT WAVE SYSTEM WITH FRONTAL 
SYSTEM. INDICATING A SLIGHTLY BETTER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION AT THIS 
REMOTE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST...WENT WITH A LITTLE HIGHER POP AT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
A MOIST AIR MASS WILL BE IN PLACE OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE 
PERIOD...WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF FORCING MECHANISMS FOR ORGANIZED 
LIFT. THIS MAKES FOR A LOW CONFIDENCE FORECAST. SOME SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND NOW DEVELOPING IN A WEAKLY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT. 
COVERAGE AND INTENSITY WILL BE MUCH LESS THAN YESTERDAY THROUGH THE 
EVENING. EXPECT THAT WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...COVERAGE 
WILL DECREASE...BUT LOW CHANCE POPS WILL BE MAINTAINED OVERNIGHT AS 
ANY LINGERING BOUNDARIES MAY HELP SPARK SOME SHOWERS. WE WILL BE 
BETWEEN TS ANDREA TO THE EAST AND A BROAD TROUGH TO THE WEST 
TOMORROW. TIMING AND LOCATION OF THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES ARE 
DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN...AND THE MODELS ARE IN POOR AGREEMENT. WILL 
FOLLOW PERSISTENCE AND HAVE CHANCE POPS IN THE MORNING WITH LIKELY 
POPS IN THE AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...
WHAT IS LEFT OF TROPICAL STORM ANDREA WILL BE TRACKING ACROSS
EASTERN VIRGINIA BY EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT. THE NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT
OUR AREA WILL BE WHAT IS EMBEDDED IN THE CLOUD MASS OVER EASTERN TX
AND AR. THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING THE BEST CHANCES OF RAIN OVER THE
WEEKEND PARTICULARLY FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS OF
TN. BY SATURDAY MORE STABLE AIR MOVES INTO THE REGION LIMITING
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT. HOWEVER BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON A FEW ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS COULD DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON AS TEMPERATURES
WARM INTO THE MID 80S AND INSTABILITY INCREASES. ANOTHER TROUGH
TRANSLATES THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION MONDAY DRAGGING A WEAK
FRONT ACROSS THE AREA. THE ECMWF AND THE GFS ARE SIMILAR IN THEIR
HANDLING OF THE UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE FEATURES FOR THIS TIME
PERIOD. WILL CONTINUE TO WATCH HOW THIS DEVELOPS OVER THE NEXT FEW
MODEL RUNS. AFTER MONDAY...NORTHWEST FLOW AND A DIFFUSE QUASI-
STATIONARY BOUNDARY NEAR OUR FORECAST AREA WILL BE AN AREA WHERE
MCS SYSTEMS COULD MIGRATE. THUS HAVE CONTINUED WITH LOW END RAIN
CHANCES THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FOR NOW OUR AREA IS BETWEEN PRECIP 
AREAS...HOWEVER...NEXT SYSTEM IS ON ITS WAY...NOW ENTERING MID TN. 
RAW TIMING OF PRESENT MOVEMENT...PUTS ARRIVAL TIME TO WESTERN CWA OF 
THIS PRECIP AT MID MORNING...BUT LIFT AHEAD OF THIS AREA WILL LIKELY 
FILL IN SOMEWHAT AHEAD OF THE MAIN CONVECTION.  THINK KCHA WILL HAVE 
PRECIP IN THE VICINITY AROUND DAYBREAK...AHEAD OF MAIN AREA.  CLOUD 
TOPS HAVE RAPIDLY WARMED OVER AL/GA AS CONVECTION DOWN THERE HAS 
WEAKENED...BUT NORTHERN PART OF CLOUD SHIELD HAS SHOWN SOME COOLING 
OVER NORTHERN AL. THIS SUPPORTS THE IDEA OF SHOWERS DEVELOPING AHEAD 
OF THE MAIN CONVECTION AS MENTIONED EARLIER.  NOT EXPECTING SEVERE 
STORMS TODAY...STRUGGLING TO GET 1000 J/KG OF SKINNY CAPE ON MODEL 
SOUNDINGS AT KCHA...AND GETS MORE STABLE FARTHER NORTH.

FOR POPS...HAVE HIGH POPS TODAY...TAPERING OFF THIS EVENING...BUT 
PICKING UP AGAIN FROM THE SOUTHWEST LATE TONIGHT.  THIS ENDS UP WITH 
POPS A LITTLE LOWER THAN GUIDANCE OVERALL.  QPF LOOKING LOWER NOW 
VERSUS LAST COUPLE OF FORECASTS...PW VALUES ARE DEFINITELY LOOKING 
TO BE LOWER NOW AS THE MOISTURE AXIS REFOCUSES ON TS ANDREA.  WENT 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...BUT HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES WITH THE SPECIFIC DETAILS 
REGARDING CONVECTION BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...AS 
MOISTURE FROM TROPICAL STORM ANDREA MOVES NORTHEASTWARD UP THE 
EASTERN SEABOARD. WITH HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES BETWEEN 1.5 
AND 1.75 INCHES...LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR 
FLOODING APPEARS POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY. SOME LINGERING WEAK INSTABILITY 
ON SATURDAY MAY RESULT IN ISOLATED CONVECTION DURING THE DAY...BUT 
OTHERWISE...THE WEEKEND LOOKS DRY UNTIL POSSIBLY SUNDAY NIGHT. 
ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO AMPLIFY OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES REGION ON SUNDAY NIGHT...WHICH WILL PUSH ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO 
BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE LOWER OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...AS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BECOMES PARALLEL TO THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. AS A RESULT...CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE EACH DAY 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERAL MESOSCALE 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES DEVELOPING OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY TO 
EVENTUALLY AFFECT PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. BOTH THE GFS AND 
ECMWF MODELS INDICATE ORGANIZED CONVECTIVE COMPLEXES AFFECTING THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY TIME PERIOD...BUT 
BOTH MODELS HAVE DIFFERENCES IN REGARDS TO TIMING AND THE EXACT 
TRACKS OF THESE COMPLEXES. THUS...WILL NOT TRY TO TIME THESE 
SYSTEMS...BUT WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS IN THE FORECAST THROUGHOUT EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN 
THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN 
BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

PROBABILITY IS LOWER AT TYS AND TRI THROUGH THE EVENING. LATER

DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE TIMING OF ANY SHOWERS AND/OR LOWERED

.DISCUSSION...
A VORT MAX OVER WESTERN KY WILL TRACK NE THROUGH THE DAY...WHILE A
SURFACE WARM FRONT ACROSS NRN AL/GA WILL BE LIFTING NORTH.
CONVECTION THIS MORNING HAS DEVELOPED ALONG THE FRONT AND ON THE SE
MARGINS OF THE VORT MAX. THE EASTWARD PROGRESS OF THESE STORMS IS
VERY SLOW. EXPECT THAT ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT WILL
BE MAINLY IN OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...ALONG
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM THE MORNING CONVECTION. RUC SOUNDINGS NEAR
TRI APPEAR MORE STABLE THAN NEAR CHA...SO BEST CHANCES WILL BE
SOUTH AND WEST THIS AFTERNOON. THE THREAT OF ORGANIZED SEVERE
STORMS APPEARS LOW AS SHEAR WILL BE WEAK...BUT MLCAPE VALUES AROUND
1000 J/KG COULD LEAD TO A MARGINAL HAIL/WIND THREAT...MAINLY SOUTH
AND WEST. 

THE UPDATE WILL REQUIRE ONLY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO POP/SKY/TEMP GRIDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE AREA 
RIGHT NOW WILL MOVE NORTHWARD TODAY...AND MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH THE 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON.  SINCE WARM FRONT WILL BE MOVING...DOUBT THAT 
IT WILL SERVE AS MUCH OF A FOCUS SINCE THERE IS NO LOW LEVEL JET 
ETC.  BY LATE MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON...INSTABILITY WILL BE 
BUILDING...WITH MAX MLCAPE VALUES OF ABOUT 1500-2000 J/KG.  COULD 
HAVE A FEW STORMS WITH POTENTIALLY DAMAGING WINDS AS WELL AS HAIL 
NEAR SEVERE CRITERIA.  WITH WEAK SHEAR FIELD...STORMS SHOULD BE 
MULTICELL.  A SHORT WAVE WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE AREA AS WELL AND 
MAY BE ABLE TO ORGANIZE STORMS INTO A LINE DURING THE AFTERNOON.  IN 
THE WAKE OF THIS SHORTWAVE...THERE MAY BE A LULL IN THE 
PRECIPITATION THIS EVENING...THEN THE NEXT ROUND OF SHOWERS AND 
STORMS WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA TONIGHT.  WENT PRETTY CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE TEMPS...AND A LITTLE ABOVE GUIDANCE IN GENERAL FOR POPS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...BUT HAVE SOME DIFFERENCES WITH THE SPECIFIC DETAILS. ON 
THURSDAY...AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFYING OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY 
WILL PUSH A WEAK COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA...AS TROPICAL 
MOISTURE MOVES NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO. AS A RESULT... 
WIDESPREAD CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES AROUND 1.75 
INCHES WILL LIKELY RESULT IN SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL EACH DAY... 
WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING. SOME LINGERING INSTABILITY ON 
SATURDAY MAY RESULT IN ISOLATED CONVECTION DURING THE DAY...BUT 
OTHERWISE...THE WEEKEND LOOKS DRY UNTIL SUNDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION ON 
SUNDAY NIGHT...WHICH WILL PUSH ANOTHER COLD FRONT TOWARDS THE 
FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO BECOME 
QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE LOWER OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...AS NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BECOMES PARALLEL TO THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY. AS A RESULT...SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE EACH 
DAY EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME MCS DEVELOPMENT 
OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY EVENTUALLY AFFECTING PORTIONS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE GFS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...ATMOSPHERE WILL BE GRADUALLY 
TRANSITIONING THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH THE LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMING 
MORE SOUTHERLY WITH INCREASING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND HIGHER 
INSTABILITY FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. MODELS BRING A WEAK SHORT 
WAVE FEATURE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON WEDNESDAY. NOT

POPS WHICH LOOK A LITTLE HIGH. STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE COOLER 
MOS MINS WHILE TRENDING IN THE MIDDLE OF GUIDANCE MAXES FOR 
WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...INVERTED SURFACE 
TROUGH CONTINUES TO BUILD THROUGH THE SOUTH...MID SOUTH AND THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY INTO THE WEEKEND. LAYER HUMIDITY INCREASES PEAKING ON 
THURSDAY WITH PWAT VALUES AROUND 1.80 ACROSS THE EAST TN VALLEY. A 
SERIES OF SHORT WAVES WILL ENHANCE LIFT THROUGH FRIDAY ACROSS THE 
AREA. UP VALLEY STORM MOTIONS COULD LEAD TO REPEAT PERIODS OF

MID TN VALLEY ON SATURDAY. MID LEVELS DRY AS LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM....CURRENTLY OVR GLFMEX MOVES NE THROUGH THE CAROLINAS.

OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. MODELS REVEAL A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT A MID 
LEVEL STABLE LAYER SHOULD KEEP ANY CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY CAPPED... 
EXCEPT POSSIBLY AROUND THE MOUNTAINS WHERE THIS CAP WILL BE WEAKER. 
THUS....WILL MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION AROUND THE APPALACHIAN

CREATE DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY 
AND TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND WILL COMPROMISE WHERE 
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THE INITIAL PART OF THIS 
PERIOD LOOKS QUIET WITH AN UPPER TROUGH STILL WELL TO THE WEST...BUT 
THE SURFACE RETURN FLOW HAS STARTED AND MOISTURE BEGINS TO PUSH BACK 
INTO THE AREA AGAIN.  BY THURSDAY THE WEAK UPPER TROUGH IS CLOSING 
IN ON THE AREA AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES RISE APPRECIABLY.  AT THE 
SURFACE...AN INVERTED TROUGH SWELLS INTO THE AREA...AND KEEP RAINS 
OVER US...UNTIL IT YIELDS TO THE SYSTEM APPROACHING NORTHERN FLORIDA 
FROM THE NORTHEASTERN GULF.  AS THIS SYSTEM IS LIFTING OUT...LOOKS 
LIKE IT DRAGS A TROWAL FEATURE ACROSS OUR AREA THAT WILL KEEP PRECIP 
OVER AT LEAST PARTS OF THE AREA THROUGH FRIDAY.  ALSO...PWAT VALUES 
SEASONALLY HIGH WITH THIS SYSTEM...SO WOULD EXPECT PRETTY EFFICIENT 
RAINS.  WOULD EXPECT 1-3 INCH RAINS OVER THE AREA OVER THAT 48 HOUR 
PERIOD...UNLESS THE SYSTEM TAKES A MORE WESTWARD TRACK AND WE GET 
DRY SLOTTED.  

ONCE THE SYSTEM OVER FLORIDA TAKES CONTROL...OUR WINDS SHIFT TO THE 
NORTHWEST AND START TO DRY US OUT OVER THE WEEKEND.  SO THE TIMING 
OF OUR PRECIP COULD BE DETERMINED BY THE STRENGTH OF THE SYSTEM IN 
THE GULF...IF IT GETS STRONGER FASTER IT COULD DRY US OUT MORE 
QUICKLY...WHEREAS IF THIS SYSTEM IS A LITTLE MORE SLUGGISH TO 
STRENGTHEN THEN THE INVERTED TROUGH WILL LIKELY PERSIST LONGER. 

AM LOWERING POPS FOR SATURDAY...ALL MODELS AGREE THAT DEEP MOISTURE 
HAS EXITED TO THE NORTHEAST...AND MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE MINIMAL 
INSTABILITY.  THE ONE FLY IN OINTMENT IS THAT THE CORE OF THE TROUGH 
IS RIGHT OVER THE AREA...SO THERE COULD BE ENOUGH WEAK LIFT ALONG 
WITH THE MINIMAL INSTABILITY TO GET SOME SHOWERS AND GET A FEW 
CLICKS ON THE RAIN GAGE...SO NOT DRYING OUT AREA QUITE THAT QUICKLY.

FOR TEMPS...WENT A LITTLE COOLER THAN GUIDANCE FRI-SUN WHILE THE 
TROUGH IS STILL OVER US...MODEL TEMPS SEEMED A LITTLE TOO WARM.  
THINK SOME CLOUD COVER WILL BE OVER THE AREA AS WELL THAT WILL 
SUPPRESS SURFACE HEATING.

THE LATEST MODEL DATA STILL SUGGESTS A MOIST LAYER DEVELOPING
OVERNIGHT. SOME ENHANCEMENT CAN BE SEEN OVER SE KENTUCKY AND
CONFIDENCE REMAINS RATHER LOW...HOWEVER PREVIOUS FORECAST PICKED UP
ON IT. THE BOUNDARY LAYER RH ACROSS SW NORTH CAROLINA REMAINS NEAR
100 PERCENT BY 12Z AS DOES AREAS ACROSS SW VIRGINIA. THEREFORE HAVE
ADDED PATCHY FOG WITH ISOLATED AREAS OF DENSE FOG POSSIBLE. THE
GROUND REMAINS WET AND IF THE LOW DECK DOES NOT MATERIALIZE THEN
OTHER AREAS OF THE TN VALLEY COULD SEE SOME PATCHY FOG AROUND
SUNRISE. EXPECT THE MAJORITY OF FOG TO DISSIPATE SHORTLY AFTER 12Z. 
THE DEVELOPMENT OF CLOUDS OVERNIGHT WILL ALSO CAUSE GROUND TEMPS TO
REMAIN WARMER THAN THE FORECAST LOWS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...WITH A VERY 
MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID 60S. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION LINGERING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE THROUGHOUT THE 
DAY AS THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY ONLY SLOWLY DRIFTS EASTWARD. CLOUDS ARE 
PROGGED TO GRADUALLY DIMINISH BY THIS EVENING...ALTHOUGH A MID LEVEL 
INVERSION TONIGHT MAY LIMIT VERTICAL MIXING AND KEEP THESE CLOUDS 
FROM DIMINISHING TOO QUICKLY. THE AMOUNT OF CLOUDS TONIGHT WILL HAVE 
LARGE INFLUENCE ON HOW MUCH FOG DEVELOPS AFTER MIDNIGHT (WITH THE 
GROUND STILL REMAINING SATURATED FROM YESTERDAY'S RAINFALL). FOR 
NOW...WILL JUST MENTION SOME PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A BRIEF PERIOD OF ZONAL FLOW/ 
WEAK UPPER-RIDGING WILL OCCUR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...RESULTING IN 
MOSTLY SUNNY AND DRY CONDITIONS. WARMER HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO 
ENSUE...WITH THE MERCURY CLIMBING INTO THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN MANY 
LOWER ELEVATION LOCATIONS. HOWEVER...WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO 
THURSDAY...AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL MOVE NORTH INTO 
ALABAMA/GEORGIA FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO AND COMBINE WITH AN 
ADVANCING UPPER-TROUGH MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS... COMBINED 
WITH A VERY MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER WILL CREATE GOOD CHANCES FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...AND EVEN BETTER CHANCES 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS A COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE REGION... 
SERVING AS A FOCUS FOR THESE SHOWERS AND STORMS. AS A RESULT...HAVE 
INCREASED POPS TO HIGH-END CHANCE THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...AND 
WENT LIKELY AREAWIDE ON FRIDAY WHEN THE FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
THROUGH. GIVEN THE HIGH PWAT VALUES...THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY 
RAINFALL AND LOCALIZED FLOODING WILL EXIST WHERE THE HEAVIEST CELLS 
DEVELOP AND TRAINING OCCURS. THEREAFTER...THINGS WILL GRADUALLY 
BEGIN TO DRY OUT HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND...BUT ADDITIONAL CHANCES 
FOR DIURNALLY DRIVEN SCATTERED STORMS WILL EXIST IN THE WARM/MOIST 
AIRMASS IN PLACE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY),,,COVERAGE OF SHOWERS AND
STORMS CONTINUES TO DECREASE OVER WRN 2/3RDS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
HOWEVER...ALREADY SEEING ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOP
ALONG AND AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT MOVING INTO MIDDLE TN...WHICH
SUPPORTS CHANCE POPS OR SCATTERED WORDING THIS EVENING. I AGREE
WITH MODELS IN LIKELY POPS JUSTIFIED OVER THE ERN MOST AREAS LATER
TONIGHT...AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE VALLEY AND CONVERGENCE
INCREASES ALONG THE TN-NC LINE. BEST INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE
CONVERGENCE AT MID TO LATE AFTERNOON IS OVER NE GA AND NW SC...
AND THESE STORMS HAVE FLARED UP IN INTENSITY. HOWEVER...THINK WE
WILL SEE AT BEST JUST A FEW STRONG STORMS OVER OUR FORECAST AREA
INTO THE EVENING. 

FOR MONDAY...FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPEARS TO BE HUNG UP ACROSS TN-NC
LINE MONDAY MORNING. THUS...I STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS POP AND
WEATHER GRIDS...WITH DRY CONDITIONS RETURNING BY MONDAY AFTERNOON.
DRY AND COOLER MONDAY NIGHT...FOLLOWED BY RIDGING AND MOSTLY DRY
WEATHER TUESDAY. ONLY CHANGE WAS TO ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
TUESDAY AFTERNOON IN THE SMOKIES AND NRN MTNS. 

GENERALLY FOLLOWED SIMILAR MOS TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD...EXCEPT
FOR CLOSER TO THE MOS BLEND ON HIGHS TUESDAY WHEN GFS LOOKED A BIT
WARM. 


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...CONTINUED TO BASIC IDEA 
OF THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WITH ATMOSPHERE GRADUALLY MOISTENING AND 
DESTABILIZING MID WEEK AHEAD OF WEAK LONG WAVE TROUGH AND SYNOPTIC 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. SLIGHT OR NO CHANCE POPS STILL LOOK GOOD FOR 
WEDNESDAY INCREASING FROM MEDIUM CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ON THURSDAY 
TO HIGH CHANCE POPS WITH THE BOUNDARY EDGING SLOWLY INTO THE REGION 
BY FRIDAY. MODELS SHOWING SUB TROPICAL LOW PRESSURE CENTER BUILDING 
NORTHEAST ALONG THE EAST COAST INTO THE WEEKEND AND THIS MAY 
INITIALLY SLOW THE BOUNDARY'S PROGRESS...KEEPING A CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN PLACE FOR SATURDAY. WOULD EXPECT 
PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION TO BE SOMEWHAT LOWER BY SUNDAY AS THE 
TROPICAL FEATURE AND FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVE FURTHER AWAY FROM THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION.

BEEN INCREASING OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...WHERE MOST OF THE 
LIGHTNING STRIKES WERE NOTED. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH...AIDED BY RIGHT

WILL LIKELY SERIOUSLY INHIBIT THE POSSIBILITY OF ANY SEVERE STORMS.
A MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING FOR HIGHS IN THE LOWER 80S YIELDED A 
POSITIVE CAPE OF JUST NEAR 500 J/KG. THE FREEZING AND WET BULB ZERO 
HEIGHTS REMAIN HIGH...SO THE THREAT OF LARGE HAIL IS QUITE LOW.

A BREAK IN THE SHOWERS AND STORMS IS POSSIBLE ON THE BACK SIDE OF

MODERATE INSTABILITY ELSEWHERE. THE PROBLEM THAT REMAINS IS LACK OF 
A FOCUS FOR DEVELOPMENT WITH NAM 12KM SHOWING MAINLY SOME WEAK 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IN THE SMOKIES THIS AFTERNOON...THEN BETTER 
CONVERGENCE IS NOTED OVER THE PLATEAU THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT.
THE ONGOING CONVECTION OVER WRN KY AND NRN MIDDLE TN MAY VERY WELL 
BE A FACTOR. CURRENT FORECAST GRIDS LOOK GOOD FOR REST OF TODAY WITH 
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE BOARD...WITH HIGHEST CHANCE WRN AREAS.

MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING ONCE AGAIN SHOWS POTENTIAL FOR MAINLY 
DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS (DRY AIR IN MID LEVELS AND ALSO BELOW CLOUD 
BASE). 

FORECAST GRIDS LOOK ON TRACK WITH HIGHS LIKELY RIGHT AT PERSISTENCE 
VALUES. WILL UPDATE ZFPMRX TO REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING FOR THE
THUNDERSTORMS...WHILE GRIDS MAY NOT NEED ANY UPDATING.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A BERMUDA HIGH CENTERED OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC...WHICH WAS BRINGING A WARM AND MOIST SOUTHERLY 
WIND FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA. OUTFLOW FROM A WEAKENING AREA OF 
CONVECTION OVER WESTERN KY SHOULD COMBINE WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE

AFTERNOON. WILL ONLY MENTION VCTS BETWEEN 18Z AND 00Z SINCE THIS 
CONVECTION WILL BE SCATTERED...AND TIMING THE EXACT OCCURRENCE AT 
THE TAF SITES WILL BE PROBLEMATIC. A BETTER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION 
WILL BE LATER TONIGHT...AS A PRE-FRONTAL SQUALL LINE FROM THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
BERMUDA HIGH CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WHICH WAS BRINGING 
A WARM AND MOIST SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY REVEALS A SOLID LINE OF CONVECTION OVER 
THE LOWER OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND OZARKS REGION CLOSER TO A COLD 
FRONT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A DEEPER LAYER OF MOISTURE OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS PROGGED TO 
DEVELOP AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...IT APPEARS THE CHANCES FOR 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE A LITTLE BETTER THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. THESE MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO CONTINUE 
TO INDICATE A VERTICAL MOISTURE PROFILE SUPPORTIVE OF DOWNBURSTS... 
WITH A DECENT MID-LEVEL DRY LAYER AND AN INVERTED-V PROFILE IN THE 
LOWER LEVELS. THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION IN THE HAZARDOUS 
WEATHER OUTLOOK THE POSSIBILITY OF STRONG DAMAGING WINDS WITH ANY 
CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. EXTENSIVE CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT IS EXPECTED OVER THE LOWER OHIO AND LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEYS ALONG THE COLD FRONT THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH THE 
RESULTING PRE-FRONTAL SQUALL LINE POSSIBLY RACING EASTWARD TONIGHT 
OUT OF AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT. WHILE THIS SQUALL LINE IS EXPECTED 
TO WEAKEN AS IT APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT... 
INSTABILITY AND SHEAR PARAMETERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA ARE STILL 
SUPPORTIVE OF SOME STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS DURING THE EARLY MORNING 
HOURS. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH A PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR 
HIGHS TODAY AND SLIGHTLY WARMER MINS FOR TONIGHT DUE TO THE EXPECTED 
HIGHER DEWPOINTS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL GRADUALLY 
TRACK INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE... 
SERVING AS A FOCUS FOR NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS... 
PARTICULARLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. THE FRONT WILL 
BE SLOW TO CLEAR THE REGION...SO SOME EXCELLENT CHANCES FOR 
PRECIPITATION WILL EXIST SUNDAY NIGHT AND INTO THE DAY ON MONDAY 
/ESPECIALLY ALONG THE EAST TENNESSEE MTNS AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/. 
THE BEST LIFT/JET DYNAMICS WILL BE DISPLACED TO THE NORTH OF THE 
REGION...BUT GIVEN THE SOME MODERATE INSTABILITY PARAMETERS IN PLACE 
SOME STRONG TO SEVERE CLUSTERS OF STORMS SEEM PLAUSIBLE IN THIS 
WARM/VERY MOIST AIRMASS...WITH STRAIGHT-LINE DAMAGING WINDS AND 
PERHAPS SOME LOW-END SEVERE HAIL BEING THREATS. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE 
VERY HIGH PWATS VALUES RUNNING AT 1.5 TO 1.8 INCHES...A SLOW MOVING 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND THE MEAN FLOW MOVING PARALLEL TO THIS FRONT... 
THINK THAT THE POTENTIAL LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL UNDER THE HEAVIEST 
CELLS IS ALSO LIKELY...WITH LOCALIZED FLASH FLOODING AND FLOODING A 
DISTINCT POSSIBILITY IN FLOOD PRONE AREAS IN LOCATIONS WHERE 
TRAINING OCCURS. 

GIVEN BETTER CONFIDENCE IN PRECIPITATION FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO CATEGORICAL AREAWIDE...BEFORE 
TAPERING THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST SLOWLY LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY AS BOTH THE NAM AND GFS HAVE SLOWED DOWN THE MOVEMENT OF THE 
FRONT AND SHOW DECENT CHANCES FOR SCATTERED TO PERHAPS WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS/STORMS INTO MONDAY. THEREAFTER...THINGS WILL FINALLY DRY OUT 
BY MONDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT EXITS AND A ZONAL FLOW ALOFT PREVAILS 
UNTIL THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. A GRADUAL WARM UP BACK INTO THE 80S 
WILL OCCUR WITH PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS BEFORE CLOUDS AND 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES INCREASE ONCE AGAIN BY FRIDAY AS ANOTHER STORM 
SYSTEM TRACKS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY/GREAT LAKES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MOST CONVECTION THIS 
AFTERNOON IS MOVING NE THROUGH CENTRAL KY ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE VORTMAX. SPOTTY SHOWERS OR TSRA ARE STILL NOTED 
OVER MIDDLE TN AND NOW DEVELOPING AS WELL OVER NRN AL. NO ORGANIZED 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE NOTED OVER GENERALLY ANY PARTS OF OUR FORECAST 
AREA THUS FAR...AND WITH INSTABILITY VERY SIMILAR TO PAST FEW DAYS.
WILL CARRY LOW CHANCE POPS FOR FAR WRN AREAS AND JUST SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS ELSEWHERE THROUGH THIS EVENING. EXPECT CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS 
EARLY THEN AN INCREASE IN LOW CLOUDINESS FOR SE TN AND SW NC AREAS 
OVERNIGHT. 

FOR LATER PERIODS...ONLY MADE VERY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS TO GRIDS AS 
RAIN CHANCES INCREASE THIS WEEKEND...ESPECIALLY LATE SATURDAY NIGHT 
INTO SUNDAY. WENT CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS MINS AND A FEW DEGREES BELOW 
GFS MOS MAXES DUE TO HIGHER RAIN CHANCES.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...LONG WAVE TROUGH AND 
SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM WORK THROUGH THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY KEEPING A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF SHOWERS GOING OVERNIGHT. MODELS 
STILL INDICATE SURFACE WAVE ALONG FRONT ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES 
MAY SLOW THE SYSTEM DOWN TO SOME DEGREE REQUIRING THE USE OF A 
MEDIUM THROUGH VERY LOW CHANCE POP GRADIENT FOR SHOWERS FROM EAST TO 
WEST MAINLY MONDAY MORNING. 12Z MODELS GENERALLY AGREE LATER WORK 
WEEK UPPER TROUGH NOT QUITE AS AMPLIFIED AS IT PASSES NORTHEAST 
THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES WITH MORE RIDGING INDICATED ACROSS MUCH OF 
THE SOUTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. 
MODELS TRY TO SHOW A SUBTROPICAL LOW OVER THE GULF WITH WESTERN 
ATLANTIC RIDGING WHICH WOULD GENERATE A BROAD EASTERLY FLOW ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA WHICH WOULD NOT BE CONDUCIVE TO ANY WIDESPREAD 
THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT IN THE REGION. THEREFORE...KEPT GENERALLY 
DRY PATTERN GOING MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH A COUPLE 
THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE ON THE HIGHER TERRAIN ON WEDNESDAY AND THEN 
ADDING SLIGHT AND SMALL CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION THURSDAY AND 
FRIDAY AS ATMOSPHERE ONLY SLOWLY MOISTENS AND DESTABILIZES. USED 
BLENDED MEX/ECM MOS GUIDANCE FOR THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WHICH WAS BRINGING A 
SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW AND AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON...ALTHOUGH MOISTURE 
WILL BE FAIRLY SHALLOW AROUND 800 MB. HOWEVER...MODELS KEEP HINTING 
AT SOME CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON...LIKELY DUE TO THE INFLUENCE OF AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM 
WEAKENING CONVECTION OVER THE WESTERN TN RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING. 
WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL MENTION ISOLATED CONVECTION AREAWIDE THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER POPS ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO INDICATE A VERTICAL MOISTURE PROFILE SUPPORTIVE 
OF DOWNBURSTS...WITH A DECENT MID-LEVEL DRY LAYER AND AN INVERTED-V 
PROFILE IN THE LOWER LEVELS. THUS...IT APPEARS THERE WILL BE A GOOD 
CHANCE FOR STRONG DAMAGING WINDS WITH ANY CONVECTION THAT MANAGES TO 
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND 
ARE ESSENTIALLY A PERSISTENCE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BE THE DOMINATE WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS AND TENNESSEE VALLEY ON SATURDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN 
ONE MORE VERY WARM DAY ACROSS THE REGION...BEFORE A SLIGHT CHANGE IN 
THE PATTERN OCCURS. AN UPPER-TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL 
BEGIN TO SHIFT FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES... 
PUSHING A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY. AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON SATURDAY...MODELS ARE INDICATING SOME 
DECENT CHANCES FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY 
ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TN. AS THE FRONT BEGINS 
TO SLOWLY TRACK ACROSS THE AREA ON SUNDAY...IT WILL BRING A MUCH 
BETTER SHOT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. THUS... 
HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY TO DEFINITE ACROSS THE AREA DURING 
THIS TIME PERIOD. THUNDERSTORM CHANCES WILL BEGIN TO WANE BY MONDAY 
MORNING AS THE FRONT MOVES EAST OF THE REGION...BUT SOME ACTIVITY 
COULD LINGER ALONG THE MOUNTAINS INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 
THEREAFTER...ANOTHER UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL MOVE OVER THE REGION... 
RESULTING IN A WARM UP BACK INTO THE 80S BY MID-WEEK AND SOME DRIER 
WEATHER. THE NEXT UPPER STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE UPPER- 
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY LATE IN THE WEEK...POTENTIALLY DRAGGING A 
COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY AND GIVING THE

FOR TSRA TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON. THIS ACTIVITY IS QUITE CLOSE TO 
OUR WRN MOST PLATEAU COUNTIES...SO I ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR

OTHERWISE...UPPER RIDGE IS THE MAIN FEATURE UNTIL THE COLD FRONT ON

THEN POTENTIAL FOR LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY. FAVORED THE CLOUDIER NAM MODEL DEPICTION AND GENERALLY 
INCREASED SKY COVER FOR ESPECIALLY FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. I DID 
NOT INCREASE POPS QUITE AS MUCH AS THE MORE ROBUST NAM MOS POPS...
STAYING CLOSER TO PREVIOUS GRIDS OR A MOS BLEND WITH THE DRIER GFS. 

PERSISTENCE ON MIN AND MAX TEMPS WHICH IS QUITE CLOSE TO GFS MOS 
GUIDANCE AND PREVIOUS TEMP GRIDS.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...PLAINS STATES UPPER 
TROUGH FINALLY BUILDS THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. 
TWO TO THREE SHORTER WAVELENGTH ENHANCERS WILL ROTATE ACROSS THE 
AREA IN THIS REGIME. THE FINAL WAVE WILL INSURE A SLOW SURFACE COLD

HIGH POPS FOR THE CONVECTIVE EVENT TAPERING BACK TO LOW THROUGH 
MEDIUM CHANCE POPS ON MONDAY. NORTHWEST FLOW AND SURFACE RIDGING 
LATER MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY NIGHT FOR A DRY EARLY WEEK PERIOD. 
THE SURFACE RIDGE GRADUALLY SHIFTS EAST WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY 
WHILE INSTABILITY STRENGTHENS. ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES ON WEDNESDAY WHILE

.DISCUSSION...MODIFIED 12Z BNA/RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW SLIGHT TO MODERATE 
INSTABILITY TODAY WITH CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT POSSIBLE AS TEMPS 
REACH THE 80S. WARM TEMPS ALOFT MIGHT NOT TOTALLY CAP OFF CONVECTION 
FROM DEVELOPING...WITH NAM MODEL ADVERTISING AREAS OF MOISTURE 
CONVERGENCE OVER NRN PLATEAU AND SMOKIES BY 18Z-21Z. WILL PROBABLY 
WAIT AND WATCH FOR NOW BEFORE ADDING ANY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO
CONTINUE OVER FORECAST AREA NEXT 24 HOURS WITH DRY AIR MASS AND
NEGLIGIBLE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SIMILAR TO
WEDNESDAY. EARLY THIS MORNING SKIES WERE MOSTLY CLEAR WITH
TEMPERATURES IN THE UPPER 50S TO THE UPPER 60S. LOW PRESSURE OVER
THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH MOVES LITTLE
THROUGH TONIGHT. AS A RESULT WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES ABOUT THE SAME
AS WEDNESDAY. SKIES WILL NOT BE QUITE AS SUNNY AS HIGH CLOUDS FROM
LEFTOVER CONVECTION FROM ACTIVITY WEDNESDAY WAS MOVING INTO THE
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. THIS WILL NOT AFFECT HIGHS TODAY.
HOWEVER CLOUDS WILL INCREASE SOMEWHAT TONIGHT FROM CONVECTION TO
THE WEST.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
AREA BEGINS TO WEAKEN AND SLIDE EAST INTO THE WEEKEND. ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES CONTINUE WHILE LAYER HUMIDITY INCREASES. AFTERNOON 
CONVECTION WILL INCREASE SOME EACH DAY FAVORING THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
...PARTICULARLY THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES AND 
ATTENDING COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE MID TN VALLEY ON SUNDAY. 
CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE FRONT WILL MOVE INTO THE MRX CWA BY SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. THIS ACTIVITY INCREASES IN COVERAGE AS IT CONTINUES INTO 
SUNDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE AREA. THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS REMAINS WEST 
EARLY MONDAY WITH LINGERING CONVECTION. TROUGH AXIS MOVES THROUGH 
MONDAY EVENING AND SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM 
THE NORTH THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. ADJUSTED TEMPERATURES 
AND DEW POINTS DOWN SLIGHTLY FOR NEXT WEEK.

CLOUDS NOTED ACROSS ERN MTNS...CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND RIDGES OF

ALOFT AND THE LACK OF ANY ORGANIZED MOISTURE CONVERGENCE. KEEPING
THE DRY FORECAST OVERNIGHT WITH POSSIBLY A FEW PATCHES OF FOG
DEVELOPING AROUND TRI AND RHP BEFORE DAYBREAK. PERSISTENCE PLUS A

MINS.

LITTLE CHANGES IN WEATHER PATTERN FOR THURSDAY...OTHER THAN A
SLIGHT INCREASE IN HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS BY LATE AFTERNOON OR MORE
LIKELY EARLY EVENING THURSDAY. GFS MAX TEMPS WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE FORECAST AREA
WILL REMAIN BETWEEN THE SURFACE LOW PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHERN
PLAINS STATES AND SURFACE HIGH EAST OF THE NC OUTER BANKS THROUGH
FRIDAY NIGHT. DAYTIME TEMPERATURES WILL WARM INTO THE UPPER 80S
WITH INCREASING RELATIVE HUMIDITY. THUS ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS WILL
BE POSSIBLE ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AFTERNOON. THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
WILL DRIFT EAST ACROSS WEST TN SATURDAY NIGHT AND MOVE INTO E TN
LATER SUNDAY AFTERNOON. LOOK FOR INCREASING RAIN CHANCES SATURDAY
NIGHT THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK SINCE THE FRONT WILL BE MOVING VERY
SLOWLY. MONDAY AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER WITH CLOUDS
AND RAIN COMING TO AN END. THEN HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR TUESDAY
WITH COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED THROUGH MID-WEEK.

RAIN CHANCES EVEN LESS THAN TUESDAY. EARLY THIS MORNING SKIES ARE
CLEAR WITH OVERNIGHT THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY CONFINED WAY TO THE
NORTH ACROSS THE MID MS VALLEY AND SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES ALONG A
STATIONARY FRONT. TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S IN THE
MOUNTAINS TO THE 60S IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS. TEMPERATURES EXPECTED
TO BE A DEGREE OR TWO WARMER THAN TUESDAY WITH LOWS TONIGHT SIMILAR
TO THIS MORNINGS.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO ONGOING 
FORECAST. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE POSITIONED OFF THE OUTER BANKS FOR 
THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...BUT WILL GRADUALLY BE LOSING ITS GRIP ON 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS INTO THE WEEKEND. THURSDAY LOOKS DRY WITH 
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS DUE TO SUBSIDENCE BENEATH THE RIDGE. THE SLOW 
EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE RIDGE ALLOWS FOR A SLIGHT INCREASE IN 
MOISTURE ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...MAINLY SOUTH AND WEST. THE NAM 
WHICH BRINGS NEGATIVELY TILTED SHORT WAVE INTO THE AREA IS MORE 
EXCITED ABOUT CONVECTION ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY THAN OTHER 
MODELS. PREFER THE DRIER SOLUTION AT THIS TIME. WILL CARRY A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP BOTH DAYS...WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS CONTINUING.

BROAD UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES FROM THE WEST THIS WEEKEND. BEST 
CHANCE FOR CONVECTION LATER SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. THE UPPER 
TROUGH AXIS MOVES EAST ON MONDAY WITH POPS ENDING MONDAY AFTERNOON. 
MILD COOL DOWN AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE NORTH EARLY NEXT

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A BERMUDA HIGH OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC...WHICH WAS BRINGING A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA RESULTING IN WARM AND HUMID CONDITIONS. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL THAT THE EARLIER ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER THE NORTHEAST TN

UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE WILL STRENGTHEN OVER THE SOUTHEAST TONIGHT...WHICH 
SHOULD HELP TO KEEP THINGS QUIET AND DRY OVER THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY/...
A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE CENTERED OFF OF THE FL/GA COAST WILL CONTINUE
TO BUILD NORTHWESTWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN
APPALACHIAN REGION THIS EVENING...RESULTING IN MOSTLY CLEAR AND
DRY CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT AND SETTING UP ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL AND VERY
WARM DAY ON WEDNESDAY. HIGHS WILL ONCE AGAIN PEAK IN THE MID TO
UPPER 80S ACROSS THE VALLEYS...WITH PERHAPS A ROUGE STORM POSSIBLE
ALONG THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS LATE IN THE DAY. HOWEVER...GIVEN
THE DRIER TRENDS WITH THE MODELS AND LACK OF ANY UPPER-LEVEL
FORCING...THINK THAT ANYTHING THAT DOES DEVELOP WILL BE SHORT-LIVED
AND VERY ISOLATED. THUS...HAVE OPTED TO REMOVE MENTIONABLE POPS
FROM THE GRIDS FOR THE AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY GIVEN THE LACK OF
CONVECTION THE PAST COUPLE DAYS ACROSS THE REGION.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE POSITIONED OFF THE OUTER BANKS FOR THURSDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY...BUT WILL GRADUALLY BE LOSING ITS GRIP ON THE AREA 
AS WE GET INTO THE WEEKEND. THURSDAY LOOKS DRY WITH ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPS DUE TO SUBSIDENCE BENEATH THE RIDGE. THE SLOW EASTWARD 
PROGRESSION OF THE RIDGE ALLOWS FOR A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MOISTURE ON 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...MAINLY SOUTH AND WEST. THE NAM IS MORE EXCITED 
ABOUT CONVECTION ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY THAN THE GFS. PREFER 
THE DRIER SOLUTION AT THIS TIME. WILL CARRY A SLIGHT CHANCE POP BOTH 
DAYS...WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS CONTINUING.

THE UPPER TROUGH THAT WILL BE APPROACHING FOR SUNDAY/MONDAY LOOKS A 
BIT MORE AMPLIFIED IN THE LATEST MODELS RUNS COMPARED TO PREVIOUS 
RUNS...WITH THE UPPER JET ENTRANCE REGION A BIT CLOSER TO OUR AREA. 
WITH THIS BETTER DYNAMIC LIFT AND CONTINUED GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN 
THE GFS AND ECMWF...CONFIDENCE IS HIGH ENOUGH TO RAISE POPS INTO THE 
LIKELY RANGE FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE THREAT 
OF SEVERE STORMS THIS PERIOD APPEARS MARGINAL AT BEST. WITH THE 
PASSAGE OF THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS...POPS SHOULD END MONDAY AFTERNOON. 
THERE WILL NOT BE A SIGNIFICANT AIR MASS CHANGE BEHIND THIS 
SYSTEM...SO TEMPS WILL CONTINUE AROUND NORMAL FOR TUESDAY.

ANOTHER BEAUTIFUL DAY IS ON TAP ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AS AN UPPER-SUBTROPICAL RIDGE OFF THE GA/FL
COAST CONTINUES TO BUILD ITS WAY INTO THE AREA. SOME BKN DECKS OF
MID TO HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD BEGIN TO DIMINISH AND MOVE OUT BY MID
DAY...RESULTING IN JUST SOME SCATTERED CU DEVELOPMENT BY THE
AFTERNOON AND A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY. WITH ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND A
SOUTHWEST FLOW IN PLACE...HIGHS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE WARM /TOPPING
OFF IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN MOST LOCATIONS/. THIS SOUTHWEST FLOW
WILL ALSO HELP TO INCREASE MOISTURE ACROSS THE AREA AND RESULT IN
THE POTENTIAL FOR A FEW ISOLATED TO PERHAPS SCATTERED STORMS ALONG
THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS LATE THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THINK
THAT MOST LOCATIONS WILL REMAIN DRY AGAIN AS RIDGING WILL CONTINUE
INTO THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED 
WARM FRONT STRETCHING GENERALLY ALONG AN INDIANAPOLIS TO CINCINNATI 
TO BECKLEY WV LINE...WITH A WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SCATTERED HIGH CLOUDS OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH ADDITIONAL HIGH CLOUDS MOVING TOWARDS THE 
TN RIVER VALLEY FROM CONVECTION OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. 
CURRENT DEWPOINT TEMPS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S WOULD SUGGEST 
THAT MINS WILL BE WARMER TONIGHT THAN LAST NIGHT...AND THAT PATCHY 
FOG WILL BE POSSIBLE AFTER MIDNIGHT.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE THIS EVENING TO REMOVE ANY EVENING PRECIP WORDING AND TO ADD 
A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG TOWARDS SUNRISE.

255 PM EDT MON MAY 27 2013

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT/...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE HAS SHIFTED INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION TODAY...PROMOTING WARM TEMPERATURES AND MOSTLY TO PARTLY
SUNNY CONDITIONS. A SCATTERED CU FIELD HAS BEGUN TO FORM WITHIN THE
PAST COUPLE OF HOURS /AND WITH SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS HELPING TO DRAW GULF
MOISTURE BACK INTO THE AREA/...MODELS ARE STILL SHOWING SOME
SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING
/PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE HIGH TERRAIN/. THIS POTENTIAL COULD BE
AIDED BY A SHORTWAVE PASSING ALONG THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE
RIDGE THIS EVENING...THOUGH AM EXPECTING THAT GIVEN THE LOW
INSTABILITY/SHEAR ANYTHING THAT DOES DEVELOP WILL BE ISOLATED IN
NATURE AND SHORT-LIVED. SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL PICK UP ON TUESDAY AS
THE RIDGE SLIDES EAST OF THE REGION OVERNIGHT...RESULTING IN THE
POTENTIAL FOR EVEN WARMER TEMPERATURES TOMORROW IN THE MID TO UPPER
80S. AN OUTSIDE SHOT AT AN ISOLATED STORM REMAINS POSSIBLE ALONG
THE MOUNTAINS...BUT DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED IN MOST AREAS
TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
A RIDGE CENTERED OFF THE OUTER BANKS WILL EXTEND WESTWARD TO THE TN 
VALLEY REGION WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. THE STRENGTHENING RIDGE WILL 
KEEP MOST THE AREA DRY EACH DAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES ABOVE NORMAL 
IN THE MID TO UPPER 80S. THE RIDGE BEGINS TO LOOSEN ITS GRIP A BIT ON 
SATURDAY AS A TROUGH MOVES INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND MS 
VALLEY...ALLOWING A LITTLE MORE GULF MOISTURE TO ADVECT NORTHWARD. 
WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR 
SATURDAY.

THE SLOW APPROACH OF THE UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
BRING CHANCE POPS TO THE AREA SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY. THE GFS AND 
ECMWF ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS TIMING...SO POPS 
WILL BE RAISED TO A HIGH CHANCE THESE PERIODS. WITH THE UPPER JET 
POSITIONED WELL TO THE NORTH AND THE BROAD APPEARANCE OF THE 
WEAKENING TROUGH...SEVERE POTENTIAL LOOKS LOW FOR THE MOMENT.

AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION TODAY...ALLOWING
FOR WARMER CONDITIONS AS THICKNESS VALUES INCREASE AND WINDS VEER
TO THE SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST. MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS THIS MORNING MAY
GIVE WAY TO PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON AS CU DEVELOP
AND SOME BLOW OFF MID TO HIGH CLOUDS FROM AN MCS OVER THE OHIO AND
MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEYS MOVE ACROSS THE REGION. SOME LOW-END
CHANCES FOR SOME DIURNALLY DRIVEN CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE THIS
AFTERNOON AS GULF MOISTURE IS DRAWN BACK INTO THE AREA. SOME OF
THESE STORMS COULD LINGER INTO THE EVENING ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AS A
WEAK SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. HOWEVER...THIS ACTIVITY WILL
BE ISOLATED TO SCATTERED IN NATURE AND MOST LOCATIONS SHOULD REMAIN
DRY. HIGHS SHOULD PEAK IN THE 80S AREAWIDE...WITH CENTRAL TO
SOUTHERN VALLEY LOCATIONS REACHING THE MID TO PREHAPS UPPER 80S.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD 
INTO THE REGION TODAY.  THIS WILL ALLOW WARMER AIR AND LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE TO MOVE BACK INTO THE AREA AS WEAK SHORT WAVE TRACKS 
THROUGH TO OUR NORTH.  INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK BUT MAY BE 
SUFFICIENT FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED CONVECTION TO MOVE INTO THE

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD IN ON TUESDAY.  DAYTIME HEATING WILL 
ALLOW DIURNAL CONVECTION TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE AREA WITH BEST CHANCE 
OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  STRENGTHENING HIGH SHOULD KEEP DIURNAL 
CONVECTION ISOLATED OVER THE MOUNTAINS ON WEDNESDAY.  AS THE RIDGE 
STRENGTHENS THROUGHOUT THE PERIOD...STRONG SUBSIDENCE WILL DIMINISH

BY THE END OF THE EXTENDED LOWER CONFIDENCE.  HOWEVER...EXPECT TO SEE

CENTERED TO OUR EAST MONDAY.  SOME VERY WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MAY 
BRUSH NORTHERN AREAS WITH A SPRINKLE OR LIGHT SHOWER LATE 
TONIGHT...BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP POPS BELOW SLIGHT CHANCE AND JUST

THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS MOST ZONES...WITH LOW CHANCE SW VA AND SOME 
OF THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS ZONES.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE 
SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... A SUBTROPICAL UPPER-
RIDGE AXIS WILL MOVE OVER THE REGION AND BECOME CENTERED OFF THE
COAST OF THE CAROLINAS THIS WEEK...ALLOWING FOR MOSTLY SUNNY
CONDITIONS AND VERY WARM TEMPERATURES...WITH HIGHS RETURNING TO THE
MID TO UPPER 80S THROUGH FRIDAY TO CLOSE OUT THE MONTH OF MAY. SOME
MOISTURE UNDERNEATH THIS RIDGE WILL ALLOW FOR ISOLATED TO SCATTERED
DIURNAL CONVECTION ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST ZONES ON
TUESDAY AND PERHAPS INTO WEDNESDAY...BEFORE DRY CONDITIONS BEGIN TO
DOMINATE HEADING INTO THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. A COLD FRONT IS EXPECTED

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...MID LEVEL MOISTURE AND SOME 
VERY WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY SPILLING OVER THE RIDGE TO OUR WEST WILL 
MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS OUR AREA...ESPECIALLY NORTHERN HALF.  WILL SEE 
AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS ESPECIALLY NORTHERN HALF...AND WHILE FORCING 
LOOKS QUITE WEAK COULD SEE A FEW SPRINKLES FALLING FROM A MID DECK 
OF CLOUDS LATE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY.  WILL MENTION POSSIBILITY OF 
SPRINKLES NORTH AND CENTRAL ZONES.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE 
OVERALL SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.  

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)... A WARMING TREND
WILL BE IN STORE FOR THE REGION NEXT WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE
AXIS MOVES EAST FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO
RIVER VALLEYS...AND EVENTUALLY INTO THE CAROLINAS BY THE MIDDLE/END
OF THE WEEK. THIS WILL PROMOTE A WARM SOUTHWEST FLOW OFF THE GULF
OF MEXICO WHICH WILL HELP TO DRAW MOISTURE BACK INTO THE REGION. AS
A RESULT...SOME CHANCES FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL EXIST EARLY
THIS WEEK /PARTICULARLY ON MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING/ AS A
SHORTWAVE TROUGH ROTATES OVER THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE.
SOME LOW-END DIURNAL THUNDER CHANCES WILL EXIST AGAIN ON
TUESDAY...AND ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST ZONES ON WEDNESDAY
AS WELL. HOWEVER...MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS SHOULD BE IN STORE FOR THE
REMINDER OF THE WORK WEEK GIVEN THE STRONG SUBSIDENCE IN PLACE.
DAYTIME HIGHS WILL RETURN TO THE MID TO UPPER 80S...WITH LOWS
REMAINING IN THE 60S OVERNIGHT. NEXT WEEKEND...ANOTHER FRONTAL
SYSTEM MAY APPROACH THE REGION...POTENTIALLY BRINGING THE NEXT
OPPORTUNITY FOR RAIN. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE
TIMING/TRACK BETWEEN THE MODELS THAT FAR OUT...HAVE NOT INTRODUCED
MENTIONABLE POPS FOR SATURDAY ATTM.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE NW. COLD AIR ADVECTION 
BECOMES NEUTRAL EARLY. AFTER COLD START TODAY TEMPERATURES WILL WARM 
NICELY WITH PLENTY OF MINUTES OF SUNSHINE. HIGH TEMPERATURES A FEW 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. NORTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES ALOFT. MID LEVEL 
MOISTURE WILL MOVE SE INTO THE AREA LATER TODAY AND CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT. LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL 
CONTINUE OVER THE REGION INTO SUNDAY.  A WEAK BOUNDARY MOVING ACROSS 
THE AREA MAY PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT FOR SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER 
THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON.  A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL SHIFT IN ON MONDAY AND WILL REMAIN THE MAIN WEATHER 
FEATURE THROUGHOUT THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.  AS THE RIDGE BUILDS 
IN...MOIST AIR WILL PUSH BACK INTO THE REGION.  THE ADDED LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE COMBINED WITH DAYTIME HEATING WILL ALLOW DIURNAL CONVECTION 
TO DEVELOP DURING THE LATER AFTERNOON EACH DAY WITH BEST CHANCES 
OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  AS FOR TEMPERATURES...A WARMING TREND WILL 
ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB ABOVE NORMAL BY THE END OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A COLD FRONT JUST OFF THE CAROLINA COAST...WITH A LARGE DOME OF HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY. A DRY AND 
UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR MASS WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA TONIGHT...AS THIS HIGH DRIFTS EASTWARD ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD 
RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS TONIGHT...BUT THE CENTER OF THE HIGH 
WILL REMAIN NORTH OF THE REGION WITH A MODERATE NORTHWESTERLY WIND 
FLOW CONTINUING ALOFT. AS A RESULT...CONDITIONS ARE NOT THE MOST 
OPTIMAL FOR RADIATIONAL COOLING TONIGHT...WITH THE NAM GUIDANCE 
TEMPS ACTUALLY SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DUE TO A TEMP 
INVERSION. THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE PREVIOUS FORECAST OF MENTIONING 
PATCHY FROST OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...MAINLY IN THE 
SHELTERED VALLEYS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY COMPROMISE BETWEEN 
THE NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...WHICH 
STILL RESULTS IN NEAR RECORD TEMPS FOR THE 25TH (CHA 46...TYS 
44...OQT 40...AND TRI 42).

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
WILL BE SLOW TO PULL AWAY FROM THE EASTERN SEABOARD THIS WEEKEND... 
LEAVING THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF NORTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT AND COOLER AND DRY CONDITIONS ON SUNDAY AS WELL. HEADING INTO 
NEXT WEEK HOWEVER...AN UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL SLOWLY BEGIN TO MOVE 
EASTWARD FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE OHIO/LOWER MISSISSIPPI RIVER 
VALLEY AND FLATTEN. THIS...ALONG WITH INCREASING THICKNESS VALUES 
AND A SOUTHWEST SURFACE FLOW WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO RETURN TO THE MID 
TO UPPER 80S FOR MOST OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK. THERE WILL STILL BE 
A GOOD MOISTURE FETCH OFF OF THE GULF WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR SOME 
LOW-END DIURNAL THUNDERSTORMS CHANCES EACH DAY THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF 
THE WEEK /PARTICULARLY ON MONDAY WHEN A WEAK SHORTWAVE ROTATES OVER 
THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE RIDGE/. FOR THE MOST PART THOUGH... 
WARM AND DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR THE MIDDLE TO LATER PART OF 
THE WORK WEEK TO CLOSE OUT THE MONTH OF MAY.

WILL DISSIPATE THIS MORNING AS A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS IN FROM THE NW. TODAY TEMPERATURES WILL BE 5 TO 10 DEGREES 
BELOW NORMAL ACCOMPANIED BY BREEZY NW WINDS. SKIES WILL BE CLEAR

AREAS OF SW VA/NE TN AND CLOSE TO THE SMOKIES.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL 
CONTINUE TO REINFORCE THE DRY AND COOL AIR THAT IS IN PLACE ACROSS 
THE REGION ON SATURDAY.  HOWEVER...WITH STRONG DAYTIME HEATING AND 
MODERATING OF THE AIR MASS...WILL SEE A SLOW WARMING TREND FOR THE 
WEEKEND.  RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN ON MONDAY AND WILL 
DOMINATE AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.  THIS WILL 
STRENGTHEN THE WARMING TREND WITH TEMPERATURES REACHING NEAR TO 
SLIGHT ABOVE NORMAL BY MID WEEK.  HOWEVER...AS THE RIDGE BUILDS

SW NORTH CAROLINA VALLEYS COULD ALSO DROP TO UPPER 30S. REFERRED TO 
FROST IN HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK AND COULD ISSUE AN ADVISORY AS 
EARLY AS FRIDAY MORNING IF CONFIDENCE IS HIGH. WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW

WARMER THAN FRIDAY AS SURFACE HIGH MOVES SOUTHEAST FROM THE UPPER 
MIDWEST INTO THE EASTERN GREAT LAKES AND OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. 
STILL SLIGHT COLD AIR ADVECTION WITH NORTHERLY FLOW. DEW POINTS WILL

THE RIDGE CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT SHORTWAVE

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER MIDDLE TN... 
GENERALLY STRETCHING ALONG A CINCINNATI TO NASHVILLE TO MUSCLE 
SHOALS LINE. MODELS INDICATE A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON AS THIS COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA. AS A RESULT...EXPECT SCATTERED CONVECTION TO DEVELOP 
AREAWIDE BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON...AS A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
FURTHER AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE 
THIS MORNING TO REMOVE ANY MORNING PRECIP WORDING...AND TO TWEAK 
TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.AVIATION...A LITTLE ACTIVE WEATHER TO START THE DAY AT TRI WHERE
AN AREA OF SHOWERS BLOSSOMED AROUND DAYBREAK. THERE WILL STILL BE
SOME MVFR FOG AND SOME IFR CEILINGS AROUND HERE FOR ABOUT AN HOUR
AS THE SHOWERS ARE MOVING OUT. CONVECTION DEVELOPS AGAIN THIS
AFTERNOON AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT WITH POSSIBILITY OF GREATEST IMPACT
AT TRI BUT THERE WILL ALSO BE SOME STORMS AROUND TYS SO USED
VICINITY THUNDER AT TYS WITH A PREVAILING CONVECTION GROUP AT TRI.
MODELS INDICATE SOME LOWER RANGE MVFR CLOUDS BUILDING IN BEHIND THE
FRONT LATER TONIGHT WITH A SHOWER POSSIBLE AT TRI SO THIS MAY
IMPACT FLIGHT OPERATIONS DURING THIS FINAL FEW HOURS OF THE FORECAST.

342 AM EDT THU MAY 23 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES
AND SURFACE COLD TO BUILD ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH THE PERIOD. A
FEW SHOWERS COULD STILL BE MOVING ACROSS EXTREME NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND A PART OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AROUND 8 AM EDT.
HOWEVER...THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL RATCHET UP
A BIT AROUND MID DAY INTO THE AFTERNOON WITH MODEL CAPES BUMPING UP
TO ABOUT 1000 J/KG OR A LITTLE HIGHER. SOME OF THE STORMS COULD
BECOME STRONG GENERATING SOME HEALTHY GUSTS AND WITH FREEZING LEVEL
AROUND TEN TO ELEVEN THOUSAND FEET...SOME LARGE HAIL IS POSSIBLE.
GRADUALLY DROP POPS BACK TONIGHT AS THE COLD FRONT BUILDS THROUGH
THE AREA. STAYED CLOSE TO MOS MAX/MIN TEMP BLEND THROUGH THE
PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...BUILDING SURFACE RIDGE OF
HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY NORTHWEST FLOW WILL PRODUCE UNSEASONABLY COOL
AND DRY CONDITIONS SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE PATCHY/
AREAS OF FROST OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND FAR
EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS.

FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST OF THE AREA WITH
RETURN OF SOUTHERLY FLOW. A WARM FRONT WILL SETUP OVER THE LOWER
OHIO VALLEY. WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR
MAINLY THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. ALSO...INCREASING
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL PRODUCE CONVECTION OVER THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS. TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO BE ON THE RISE AS UPPER RIDGE
BEGINS INTO THE AREA.

FOR WEDNESDAY...WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH OF THE AREA. UPPER RIDGE
WILL BE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS PRODUCING VERY WARM AND
MAINLY DRY CONDITIONS. AGAIN...STILL EXPECT CONVECTION OVER THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.AVIATION...APPEARS LIKE MORE ACTION IN STORE FOR AVIATION
INTERESTS AGAIN TODAY AS WIDELY SCATTERED SHOWERS AND AN ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORM ARE ROAMING EAST ACROSS THE VALLEY EARLY THIS MORNING.
ANOTHER VORT LOBE AND SURFACE FRONT ROTATE INTO THE REGION LATER
TODAY BRINGING A DECENT CHANCE FOR CONVECTION AT THE TERMINALS.
MUCH OF THE PRECIPITATION WILL HAVE ENDED AROUND 00-03Z TONIGHT AS
THE LIFTING FEATURES MOVE EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS. THERE SHOULD BE
SOME FOG DEVELOPMENT AT THE TERMINALS THIS MORNING FROM WEDNESDAY'S

.DISCUSSION...AIRMASS STABILIZING AT THIS POINT...BUT ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY LINGERS TO KEEP AT LEAST SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED 
TSRA IN THE FORECAST OVERNIGHT. SPC WEB PAGE SHOWS BEST SHEAR OF 
AROUND 35 TO 40 KNOTS OVER OUR NRN PLATEAU NORTH INTO SE KY AND SW 
VA...SO BETTER COVERAGE SHOULD OCCUR OVER THOSE AREAS...WHERE I MAY 
KEEP LIKELY POPS OVERNIGHT. 

OTHERWISE...HOURLY AND MIN TEMPS MAY NEED MORE ADUSTING...ESPECIALLY 
WHERE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE COOLED TEMPS DOWN SIGNIFICANTLY 
ALREADY.

SURVEYED THURSDAY BY NWS MORRISTOWN.

.AVIATION...SCATTERED TSRA CONTINUE TO TRACK N TO NE ACROSS THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH AN OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARY BISECTING THE FORECAST AREA FROM LAST NIGHT'S CONVECTION 
OVER MIDDLE TN. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS REVEAL A MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...AS AN 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS ALSO INDICATE A DECENT MID LEVEL WIND FLOW BETWEEN 20 AND 
40 KT...SO IT APPEARS THERE WILL BE A GOOD CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER 
INTO THIS EVENING. PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES REMAIN HIGH THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING (BETWEEN 1.5 AND 1.75 INCHES)...SO THINK THAT 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE A POSSIBILITY WITH SOME STORMS. 
MODELS ALSO INDICATE 0-1 KM HELICITY VALUES INCREASING AND LCL 
HEIGHTS LOWERING THIS EVENING...ESPECIALLY OVER NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA...SO IT APPEARS THAT THERE COULD BE AN ISOLATED TORNADO 
OR TWO. THE COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
ON THURSDAY...WITH WINDS INCREASING AND SCATTERED CONVECTION AGAIN 
POSSIBLE. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT FOR TONIGHT AND THURSDAY...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME 
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...DEEP UPPER
TROUGH FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR PUSHING A SECONDARY COLD FRONT
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING. AIR
MASS NOT AS UNSTABLE BY THURSDAY EVENING WITH MAINLY SHOWERS AHEAD
OF SECONDARY FRONT. BEST CHANCE OF RAIN ACROSS NORTHEAST SECTIONS.
LOWS SEVERAL DEGREES COOLER IN THE 50S TO POSSIBLY UPPER 40S HIGHER
ELEVATIONS. HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE NW BUILDS IN FRIDAY WITH
TEMPERATURES AS MUCH AS 10 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL AND NORTH TO
NORTHWEST WINDS 10 TO 15 MPH. LOWS FRIDAY NIGHT DROPPING TO THE 40S
WITH UPPER 30S HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND HIGHER NE VALLEYS. FROST MAY
BE POSSIBLE IN ISOLATED LOCATIONS THERE. NORTHWEST FLOW WITH COOLER
TEMPERATURES TO CONTINUE SATURDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH
TEMPERATURES SLOWLY WARMING EACH DAY. MOISTURE TO INCREASE BY
SUNDAY AS FLOW AROUND RIDGE OVER THE CENTRAL STATES BRINGS A FRONT
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. FROM SUNDAY EVENING THROUGH MID WEEK SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE AGAIN. ACTIVITY SHOULD BE HIGHEST DURING
PEAK HEATING HOURS OF THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MORE CONVECTION EXPECTED TODAY 
WITH PLENTY OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING THROUGH THE MEAN UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH ACROSS MID AMERICA. WITH SOME HEATING AHEAD OF THE MAIN 
FEATURE...CURRENTLY BUILDING NORTHEAST THROUGH WEST TENNESSEE AND 
NORTHERN MISSISSIPPI...MODELS PROG RATHER DECENT INSTABILITY WITH 
CAPES BUMPING UP TO AROUND 2000 J/KG OR HIGHER AND LIFTED INDICES AS 
HIGH AS -8 BY EARLY AFTERNOON. BULK SHEAR NOT QUITE AS IMPRESSIVE 
BUT STILL AROUND 30 TO 35 KTS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH VALUES 
APPROACHING 40 KTS ON THE PLATEAU DURING THE AFTERNOON. 
THEREFORE...THERE IS A CHANCE FOR SEVERE CONVECTION MID DAY ON THE 
PLATEAU AND POINTS EAST THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. HELICITY VALUES NOT 
TERRIBLY IMPRESSIVE SO THREAT FOR TORNADOES WILL BE REDUCED. MODELS 
SHOW WEAKENING FRONTAL BOUNDARY BUILDING INTO THE REGION TONIGHT 
WITH ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE ENERGY SWINGING ACROSS THE AREA SO WENT 
WITH LIKELY PROBABILITIES FOR ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
MAINLY THROUGH LATE EVENING WITH PERCENTAGES DROPPING OFF AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. TRIED TO STAY CLOSE A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX TEMPS DURING 
THE SHORT TERM WITH MAV MAXES A BIT TOO WARM MOST AREAS. STAYED 
CLOSER TO THE MILDER MIN GUIDANCE TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE
ACROSS THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS THURSDAY ALONG WITH A
SECONDARY COLD FRONT THAT WILL USHER IN UNSEASONABLY COOL AIR INTO
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW AIR-MASS WILL
ONCE AGAIN BECOME MARGINALLY UNSTABLE WITH CAPES OF 1000-1500 J/KG
DURING THE AFTENOON. BEST INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE WILL BE ACROSS
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. HAVE INCLUDE LIKELY POPS
NORTH TO LOW-CHANCE SOUTH FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON.

MODELS SHOW A GOOD DEAL OF COLD-AIR STRATU-CU AND SOME OROGRAPHIC
LIFT FOR THURSDAY NIGHT-ENDING FRIDAY MORNING. WILL MAINTAIN A GOOD
DEAL OF CLOUD-COVER AS WELL SCATTERED SHOWS. BEST CHANCES OVER THE
HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE NORTHWEST FLOW WILL PRODUCE OROGRAPHIC LIFT.

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND...UNSEASONABLY COOL AND DRY AIR-MASS
WILL BE RULE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. WOULD NOT BE
SURPRISED TO SEE SOME FROST ACROSS THE NORTHEAST AND MOUNTAINS
FRIDAY NIGHT.

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK..THE GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER GREATLY ON WHERE AND
EXTENT OF CONVECTION ALONG DEVELOPING WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS
THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. THE ECMWF IS MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE.
WILL TREND TOWARD THE GFS..BUT SOME ENSEMBLE MEMBERS DO AGREE WITH
SOME HIGHER POPS.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

TODAY IN THE GREAT VALLEY AS MODELS INDICATE TWO OR THREE SHORTER
WAVELENGTH FEATURES WILL BUILD ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION IN VERY SLOW WEATHER PATTERN GOVERNED BY MID AMERICAN UPPER
LEVEL TROUGH. SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION ALIGNED ON THE WESTERN
PLATEAU DOESN'T APPEAR TO IMPACT THE TERMINALS THROUGH THE FIRST
SEVERAL HOURS OF THE FORECAST. AVIATION WILL MOST LIKELY BE
AFFECTED AROUND MID DAY THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS LIFT WITH INITIAL
WAVE DRIVING CONVECTION ACROSS WEST TENNESSEE AND NORTHERN
MISSISSIPPI HEADS EAST. DECENT AMOUNT OF JUICE AVAILABLE IN
UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT FOR STORMS SO JUST WENT AHEAD AND USED A
PREVAILING CONVECTIVE GROUP FOR THE MAIN EVENT AT THE TERMINALS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...EARLY MORNING DENSE
FOG ACROSS MAINLY SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE.
CURRENTLY COVERAGE IS SCATTERED...PER SATELLITE/OBS...BUT WILL
MONITOR FOR POTENTIAL ADVISORY.

A LINE OF STORMS IS CURRENTLY ACROSS FAR WESTERN TENNESSEE. LATEST
NAM SUGGEST THE OUTFLOW BOUNDARY FROM THIS CONVECTION WILL MOVE
ACROSS TENNESSEE THIS MORNING/EARLY AFTERNOON AND BE LOCATED OVER
THE PLATEAU BY 16-18Z. AIRMASS WILL BE MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH
CAPES OF 2000-2500 J/KG..SO SCATTERED TO BROKEN CONVECTION
ANTICIPATED ALONG THIS BOUNDARY AS WELL AS ALONG TERRAIN FEATURES.
A GOOD DEAL OF MID-LEVEL DRY AIR WILL PROMOTE DRY AIR ENTRAINMENT
INTO THE DOWNDRAFTS WITH DAMAGING WINDS A CONCERN. ALSO...WET BULB
ZERO HEIGHTS AND HAIL CAPE VALUES WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR MARGINAL
LARGE HAIL. HAVE INCLUDED WITHIN THE HWO.

CONVECTION WILL DIMINISH THIS EVENING DUE TO LOSS OF DAYTIME
HEATING. 

FOR WEDNESDAY...AN APPROACHING FRONT AND LIKELY OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES
COMBINED WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY WILL PRODUCE SCATTERED TO BROKEN
CONVECTION. MODELS CURRENTLY DO NOT FAVOR AN OUTBREAK OF SEVERE WEATHER..BUT
GIVEN THE INCREASING MID-LEVEL WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER TROUGH
OVER THE MID-WEST..WE WILL HAVE TO MONITOR FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF STRONG-
SEVERE STORMS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES  
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY MAKING SLOW PROGRESS AS IT SHIFTS FROM THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO THE EASTERN SEABOARD BY 00Z SATURDAY. BUMPED 
POPS UP SLIGHTLY ON THURSDAY WITH A COLD FRONT BUILDING THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MAINTAINED SOME CHANCE POPS THURSDAY NIGHT 
TAPERING TO SLIGHT CHANCE ON FRIDAY AS MODELS INDICATE A FAIR AMOUNT 
OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND DEEP MOISTURE ROTATING THROUGH THE EASTERN 
U.S. LONG WAVE. STAYED WITH CONVECTION ON THURSDAY BUT WITH 
INCREASING STABILITY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY USED SHOWER WORDING. 
PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW WITH DRY ADVECTION AND A NICE EXPANSIVE 
SURFACE RIDGE SHOULD ALLOW FOR A DRY PERIOD SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY. 
GFS/CMC HINT AT THE PASSAGE OF A SHORT WAVE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY 
WITH LOW LEVEL WARM AND MOIST ADVECTION DEVELOPING ON THE BACK SIDE

REMOVE THE LOW-END MENTIONABLE POPS FROM THE FAR NORTHEAST AND
MOUNTAIN ZONES AS ALL CONVECTION HAS REMAINED EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS

THE MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER CONDITIONS AND CALM WINDS...THE POTENTIAL
FOR AREAS OF FOG TO FORM /ESPECIALLY IN THE USUAL FOG-PRONE AREAS/

AREA WILL REMAIN DRY AS AN UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD IN.  ON 
TUESDAY...WARM...MOIST AND WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR OVER THE REGION WILL 
WILL ALLOW FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION TO DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON.  
THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD INITIATE OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH ONLY A FEW 
MOVING INTO THE VALLEY LATE IN THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...WETTEST PERIODS OF THE LONG 
TERM STILL LOOK TO BE WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. NUDGED POPS UP TO LIKELY BY NOON WEDNESDAY 
ACROSS ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA...AND CARRIED 40 TO 50 PERCENT POPS 
FOR WEDNESDAY EVENING WITH SCATTERED WORDING.

FRONTAL PASSAGE NOT LIKELY TO OCCUR UNTIL THURSDAY AFTERNOON OR 
EVENING WITH CHANCE POPS NEEDED THROUGH ABOUT 12Z FRIDAY. A SURFACE 
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE THEN BEGINS TO BUILD SE THROUGH THE WEEKEND
WHILE UPPER LEVEL HEIGHTS ALSO RISE. 12Z GFSX MOS POPS ARE TRENDING 
A LITTLE DRIER THAN THE 00Z GUIDANCE...BUT FOR NOW I KEPT IN LOW 
TOKEN POPS BOTH FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT FOR POSSIBLE SPOTTY DIURNAL 
CONVECTION. 

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...A WARM FRONT APPEARS TO BE A FOCUS FOR SOME 
CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION TO OUR NW BY MONDAY...WITH 12Z GFS MODEL 
SHOWING A SHORTWAVE MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER RIDGE AND SPREADING 
CONVECTION SE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND TO THE SRN APPALACHIANS BY 
MONDAY NIGHT. SOME LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW DOES RETURN BY MONDAY 
WHICH SUPPORTS AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SPOTTY DIURNAL 
CONVECTION. 

12Z GFSX MOS TEMPS HAVE TRENDED A FEW DEGREES COOLER ON BOTH MAX AND

CONCERN TODAY WITH THE GREATEST COVERAGE OVER THE NORTHEAST
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. BESIDES THE HEAVY RAIN..ISOLATED
SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE WITH HAIL UP TO 1 INCH.

ELSEWHERE TODAY...AIRMASS WILL REMAIN MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITH
CAPES OF 2000-2500 J/KG. UPPER RIDGING WILL BE BUILDING INTO THE

THE LOCAL TERRAIN. PLENTY OF MID-LEVEL DRY AIR TO BE CONCERN OF
DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS FOR THE STRONGEST STORMS..AS WELL AS
MARGINAL HAIL AND LOCALIZED HEAVY RAINFALL.

FOR TONIGHT...LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING WILL ALLOW CONVECTION TO
DIMINISH THIS EVENING. RADIATIONAL COOLING AND PLENTY OF LOW-LEVEL
MOISTURE WILL PRODUCE PATCHY/AREAS OF FOG. SOME LOCALLY DENSE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WARM AND MUGGY CONDITIONS CAN

AHEAD OF THE LARGE UPPER TROUGH TO THE WEST. THE UPPER TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL MEANDER SLOWLY EASTWARD BY 
WEDNESDAY INCREASING CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE

330 PM EDT SUN MAY 19 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL 
CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
TONIGHT.  THIS HAS PRODUCED WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM INTO 
THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.  SOME OF THESE STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG TO 
SEVERE.  THE LOW WILL CONTINUE TO PULL AWAY FROM THE AREA ON 
MONDAY...BUT THE AIR MASS WILL REMAIN WARM...MOIST AND AT LEAST 
WEAKLY UNSTABLE FOR SCATTERED MAINLY DIURNAL TYPE CONVECTION.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
PATTERN ON TUESDAY AND EXPECTED ANOTHER DAY OF DIURNAL CONVECTION.  
A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE THROUGH WEDNESDAY FOR OUR BEST 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE EXTENDED.  A TROUGH AXIS 
IS PROGGED TO SLIDE THROUGH AROUND THE THURSDAY/FRIDAY TIME FRAME 
CONTINUING A CHANCE OF CONVECTION.  DRY NORTHWEST FLOW SHOULD SET UP 
FOR THE WEEKEND FOR OUR BEST SHOT AT DRY CONDITIONS FOR THE EXTENDED.

SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TODAY.  A WEAK BOUNDARY IN PLACE OVER 
MIDDLE TN TO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS WELL AS INCREASING 
INSTABILITY...WILL ALLOW WIDER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION AND ALSO ALLOW

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED MOISTURE 
CONVERGENCE BOUNDARY STRETCHING GENERALLY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER 70S WEST OF IT (OVER MIDDLE TN 
AND NORTHERN AL) AND IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED CONVECTION OCCURRING ALONG THIS 
CONVERGENCE BOUNDARY...WITH SOME TRAINING CELLS OVER MARION COUNTY 
PRODUCING LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. THIS VERY HUMID SUMMER-LIKE AIR 
MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE SCATTERED 
CONVECTION TODAY...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH LINGERS OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. IN FACT...BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS 
REVEAL A MODERATELY TO HIGHLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING TODAY 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH THE BEST INSTABILITY EXPECTED NEAR THE 
BOUNDARY OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THIS INSTABILITY SHOULD LEAD 
TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME STRONG TO SEVERE TSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING...ALTHOUGH A FAIRLY WARM MID LEVEL LAYER MAY KEEP THIS 
ACTIVITY FROM BECOMING TOO WIDESPREAD. FAIRLY HIGH PRECIPITABLE 
WATER VALUES AROUND 1.5 INCHES SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRODUCE SOME 
LOCALIZED FLOODING WITH ANY SLOW-MOVING OR TRAINING CONVECTION.

HAVE ALREADY UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO BEEF UP THE 
WORDING FOR TODAY SOME MORE...AND WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE ZONE 
FORECASTS THIS MORNING TO REMOVE ANY MORNING PRECIP WORDING AND TO 
TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND
TONIGHT WITH THE AXIS BEING EAST OF THE AREA MONDAY MORNING. PLENTY
OF MOISTURE AND MODERATE INSTABILITY WILL PRODUCE SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THE SHORT-TERM. MODELS SHOW CAPE OF 1500-2000
J/KG FOR THE PLATEAU WITH LESSER AMOUNTS EAST FOR THIS AFTERNOON-
EVENING. SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT HEAVY RAINFALL WILL ONCE AGAIN BE THE
MAIN THREAT TODAY-TONIGHT WITH MARGINAL HAIL UP TO 1 INCH POSSIBLE
WITH THE STRONGER STORMS.

FOR TONIGHT...ABUNDANT LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE AND CLOUD COVER FROM
UPPER LOW MOVING EAST WILL ALLOW FOR A GOOD AMOUNT OF RADIATIONAL
FOG DEVELOPMENT AREA-WIDE. HAVE INCLUDED AREAS OF FOG FOR
TONIGHT..SOME OF THE FOG WILL LIKELY BE DENSE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...BY MONDAY...THE UPPER TROUGH 
WILL STILL BE OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW 
WILL BE CO-LOCATED NEAR NORTHERN NEBRASKA AND BY MONDAY EVENING 
EXPECT ANOTHER LOW TO FORM FARTHER SOUTH OVER NE TEXAS. ALL THIS 
OCCURRING TO THE WEST WILL HELP DRIVE TEMPERATURES UPWARDS OVER THE 
BEGINNING HALF OF THE WEEK AND MAKE CONDITIONS RATHER MUGGY AND 
HUMID. 

A SHORTWAVE RIDGE OVER OUR AREA ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY WILL 
HELP INHIBIT WIDESPREAD THUNDERSTORMS BUT A FEW ISOLATED 
SHOWERS/STORMS WILL STILL BE POSSIBLE. IT WILL NOT BE UNTIL THE 
AFOREMENTIONED TROUGH TRANSLATES EAST THAT WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL OCCUR...WHICH SHOULD BE BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. COMPARING THE LONGER RANGE MODELS THIS MORNING ARE 
NEARLY OPPOSITE FROM LAST 00Z RUNS. THE GFS IS SLOWER WITH FROPA 
LATE THIS WEEK INTO THE WEEKEND...WHILE THE ECMWF IS QUICKER AND 
DRIER BY SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. ALTHOUGH BOTH MODELS KEEP RELATIVELY 
DRY CONDITIONS INTO THE HOLIDAY WEEKEND AND TEMPERATURES WILL RETURN 
TO NEAR NORMAL BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN TN RIVER 
VALLEY...WITH A WARM AND VERY HUMID AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN AREAL 
COVERAGE AND INTENSITY AS DAYTIME HEATING COMBINES WITH AN UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH TO PRODUCE A POTENTIALLY MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE NAM MODEL ONLY REVEALS SOME MARGINAL 
INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR LATER TODAY AND AGAIN ON 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON...BUT THE GFS MODEL INDICATES MODERATE INSTABILITY 
DEVELOPING (DUE TO ITS WARMER SURFACE TEMPS) WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR 
A HIGHLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS AROUND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ON SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AND AREAWIDE ON MONDAY AFTERNOON. IF THE GFS MODEL 
VERIFIES...THINK THAT SOME ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE 
ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND MONDAY AFTERNOON...WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF 
DAMAGING WINDS...LARGE HAIL...AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL (DUE TO 
SLOW-MOVING CONVECTION IN AN ENVIRONMENT WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER 
VALUES RANGING BETWEEN 1.5 AND 1.75 INCHES). THIS SLOW-MOVING UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH WILL FINALLY DRIFT EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 
MONDAY...BUT COOLER NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BEHIND THE TROUGH WILL HELP 
TO DESTABILIZE THE LOCAL AIR MASS ALLOWING FOR ADDITIONAL SCATTERED 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WARM...MOIST AIRMASS IN 
PLACE EARLY IN THE EXTENDED WITH SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. THE RESULT 
WILL BE DIURNAL CONVECTION TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. BROAD...WEAK 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIDES THROUGH AROUND THURSDAY...AND WILL PROVIDE 
OUR BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION. TROUGH AXIS WILL MOVE THOUGH THURSDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...THE MAIN WEATHER
FEATURE WILL BE WEAKENING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY
AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND AFTERNOON AND
EVENING THUNDERSTORMS WILL CONTINUE TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY.
INSTABILITY BECOMES A LITTLE BETTER SUNDAY AS A LITTLE MORE
INSOLATION ANTICIPATED. WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY POPS THROUGH MOST
OF THE PERIOD. AREA RAINS AND CLOUDS SLOWLY DIMINISHING THROUGH THE
PERIOD WILL ALLOW FOR RADIATIONAL FOG DEVELOPMENT FOR SATURDAY AND
SUNDAY NIGHTS. WOULD NOT BE SUPRISED TO SEE LOCALLY DENSE FOG.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES FOLLOWED A BLEND OF MET AND GFS MOS..WHICH HAS
WORKED BEST THE PAST COUPLE DAYS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE RIDGING 
WILL OCCUR ON MONDAY WITH CHANCES OF THUNDERSTORMS FOCUSED ON THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE MOUNTAINS OF NE TN AND SW VA. SOUTHERLY LOW 
LEVEL FLOW WILL PROVIDE ABUNDANT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE BY TUESDAY. THE 
UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THE ASSOCIATED FRONT WILL BE ACROSS WEST 
TENNESSEE WEDNESDAY BUT SEEMS TO LOSE ITS IDENTITY BY THURSDAY. THE 
MORE DEFINED FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE ACROSS THE NORTHERN OHIO 
VALLEY. THE GFS SLOWLY BRINGS THE COOLER AIR INTO THE REGION 
SOMETIME FRIDAY WHILE THE ECMWF IS ABOUT 24 TO 36 HOURS SLOWER. 
ADDITIONALLY THE ECMWF IS MUCH LESS AMPLIFIED WITH ITS HANDLING OF 
THE MID-WEEK UPPER TROUGH AS IT TRACKS IT INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION RATHER THAN OVER THE SOUTHERN OHIO VALLEY. WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY LOOK LIKE THE BEST CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR

NORMAL AND SLOWLY TREND TOWARDS NORMAL BY THE END OF THE WEEK.

THE LATEST OBS INDICATE SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY ACROSS THE

LINGER PAST SUNSET INTO THE MID/LATE EVENING HOURS. HOWEVER...AS
NIGHT SETTLES IN...THINK THAT MOST OF THE THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY

SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION WILL BE
ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
EVENTUALLY SPREAD INTO THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN VALLEY AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA LATER TONIGHT. HAVE WENT AHEAD AND GONE DEFINITE POPS ACROSS

AREA RADARS REVEAL ISOLATED CONVECTION DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE IN AREAL

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FOR EARLY THIS
MORNING..LOCALIZED DENSE FOG BEING REPORTED OVER THE NORTHERN HALF
OF THE AREA WHERE SKY COVER IS MORE SCATTERED AND BETTER CHANCE OF
RADIATIONAL FOG. HAVE INCLUDED PATCHY FOG IN THESE AREAS THIS MORNING.

AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE SLOWLY ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE
TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS. ASSOCIATED UPPER DIVERGENCE AND
BOUNDARY-LAYER CONVERGENCE WILL PRODUCE BANDS OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS. ALSO...INCREASING LOW- LEVEL MOISTURE WILL AID WITH
DESTABLIZING THE AIR-MASS WITH DIURNAL STORMS..ESPECIALLY OVER
TERRAIN..FOR THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS. MAIN CONCERN FOR
THESE STORMS WILL BE LOCALIZED HEAVY DOWNPOURS/URBAN AND SMALL
STREAM FLOODING AND POSSIBLY SMALL HAIL. BEST CHANCE OF STRONG
STORMS WILL BE OVER THE NORTHEAST HALF OF THE AREA WHERE MORE
SUNSHINE IS ANTICIPATED.

FOR TONIGHT...PERIODS OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDER ANTICIPATED
WITH THE BEST CHANCE OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST WHICH
WILL BE CLOSER TO THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED A MIX OF MET/MAV MOS TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM /SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY/...WET PATTERN IS EXPECTED TO 
CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS THE WEAK UPPER LOW PRESSURE CENTER 
TRUDGES EASTWARD WITH TIME. BY MONDAY...IT LOOKS LIKE THE UPPER LOW 
WILL BE FAR ENOUGH EAST TO ALLOW SHORT WAVE RIDGING TO BUILD OVER 
THE AREA.  MODEL SOUNDING SHOW SUBSIDENCE INVERSION BUILDING AS WELL 
IN THE 700-800 MB LAYER OVER MOST OF THE AREA BY MONDAY.  THIS 
PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH TUESDAY...BUT THEN BY WED THE NEXT TROUGH 
IS APPROACHING ALONG WITH ITS ASSOCIATED LIFT.  WILL GO DRY IN MOST 
VALLEY LOCATIONS ON MON AND TUE.  FOR THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...HAVE IT 
DRY MON BUT SOME POPS ON TUE AS RIDGE IS BREAKING DOWN FASTER THAT 
FAR TO THE NORTHWEST.  BY THE END OF THE PERIOD...THIS SYSTEM MAKE 
MAKE IT OUT OF THE AREA...BUT HAVE LEFT SOME LIGHT POPS IN.

FOR TEMPS...WENT ON THE COOL SIDE OF MAX TEMPS ON SAT/SUN 
CONSIDERING EXTENSIVE CLOUD COVER...BUT ALSO RELATIVELY COOL 
CONVECTIVE TEMPS...ESPECIALLY ON SATURDAY.  WITH LESS CLOUD COVER ON 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY NIGHT...WENT ON THE COOL SIDE OF MIN TEMPS.  

THERE SHOULD BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY AROUND FOR THE THREAT OF 
THUNDERSTORMS...BUT THE AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY AND/OR WIND SHEAR IN 
THE ATMOSPHERE THIS FAR EAST SHOULD NOT GET OVERLY HIGH DURING THIS 
PERIOD...THEREFORE...THE SEVERE STORM THREAT WILL BE LIMITED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...NOT MUCH CONVECTION AS OF THIS
WRITING BUT SOME ISOLATED OR SCATTERED CONVECTION IS STILL POSSIBLE
THROUGH SUNSET WITH THE PLATEAU BEING WHERE THERE IS A SLIGHTLY
BETTER CHANCE OF GETTING WET THAN ELSEWHERE. ONLY 20 PCT POPS THIS
EVENING IN THE VALLEY. BUT RAIN CHANCES WILL ONLY GO UP STARTING
FRIDAY AS THE SLOW MOVING UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE MID-SOUTH WILL
SLOWLY MOISTEN AND DESTABILIZE THE AIRMASS HERE. INCREASED CHANCES
OF ...MOSTLY... DIURNAL CONVECTION ON FRIDAY...CONTINUING THROUGH
ANOTHER WET WEEKEND. THAT'S RIGHT. MORE ON THAT BELOW.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT
WE WILL REMAIN IN A RATHER UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN THROUGHOUT THE

MONDAY...WARM...MOIST AND WEAKLY TO OCCASIONALLY MODERATELY UNSTABLE

TRIGGER A CHANCE OF CONVECTION EACH PERIOD. CURRENT MODEL RUNS POINT
TO SATURDAY AS BEING OUR BEST CHANCE AT WIDESPREAD CONVECTION WITH
THE PASSAGE OF THE LOW. MONDAY NIGHT WE SHOULD BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO HELP TRANSPORT A WARM/MOIST
GULF AIRMASS INTO THE REGION TODAY AS AN UPPER-LOW OVER THE MID-
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY PUSHES OUT AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THAT HAS BEEN
PROMOTING THE SUNNY AND CLEAR CONDITIONS ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE
PAST SEVERAL DAYS. THE COLDER TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL HELP TO
CREATE SOME INSTABLITY...AND ALLOW FOR SOME SCATTERED DIURNALLY
DRIVEN CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THIS ACTIVITY
MAY ALSO BE AIDED BY SOME LIFT FROM THE AFOREMENETIONED UPPER-LEVEL
DISTURBANCE...SO HAVE INCLUDED AT LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR BOTH
TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE WARM TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE...BUT MAY BE
A FEW DEGREES COOLER THAN WEDNESDAY GIVEN THE INCREASED CLOUD COVER
AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES. 

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
A WARM AND MOIST AIRMASS LINGERS THROUGH THE LONG TERM PERIODS
WITH SLIGHT TO MODERATE INSTABILITY. THE CHALLENGE IS CHOOSING
WHICH DAYS HAVE THE BETTER FORCING AND COULD SEE 60 PERCENT OR
HIGHER COVERAGE OF TSRA. MODELS ARE MORE CONSISTENT AND IN BEST
AGREEMENT ON HIGHEST POPS JUSTIFIED FOR SATURDAY AT THIS POINT.
DAYTIME HEATING PLUS A WEAK UPPER LOW SUPPORTS PUSHING POPS UP TO
LIKELY OVER ALL BUT SE TN ON SATURDAY.

OTHERWISE...THE CLOSEST PROXIMITY OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR 
NORTH WILL BE FROM FRIDAY INTO SUNDAY...FAVORING SOMEWHAT HIGHER 
POPS IN GENERAL FOR SW VA AND NE TN. HOWEVER...THE BEST TARGETS FOR 
OPPORTUNITY TO BETTER GFSX MOS POPS DO APPEAR TO BE ON SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY. THUS...STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS FOR THOSE 
PERIODS...WHICH IS 20 PERCENT OR MORE BELOW THE 16/00Z GFSX MOS POPS.

WEDNESDAY IS NOW TRENDING WETTER WITH A POTENTIAL COLD FRONT 
APPROACHING...BUT STILL QUITE EARLY TO BUY HEAVILY INTO THIS TIMING. 
KEPT POPS AROUND 40 TO 50 PERCENT WHICH IS VERY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE.
THE THREAT OF ANY ORGANIZED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS IS VERY LOW AT 
THIS TIME...PENDING THE DEVELOPMENT AND TIMING OF THE COLD FRONT 
EARLY TO MID NEXT WEEK.

MORE SUMMER LIKE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AS UPPER LEVEL SUBTROPICAL 
RIDGE CONTINUES TONIGHT. AT MID AFTERNOON SKIES REMAIN SUNNY AND 
TEMPERATURES ARE AT OR A LITTLE ABOVE NORMAL IN THE UPPER 70S TO MID 
80S. SHORT RANGE ENSEMBLE MODELS DEVELOP WEAK UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
PRESSURE AREA OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TONIGHT AND MOVE IT EAST WITH 
SHOWERS AND STORMS FORMING ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE BY MORNING. THE 
FORECAST AREA WILL REMAIN DRY BUT CLOUDS WILL INCREASE FROM WEST TO 
EAST LATE TONIGHT. THE MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW AROUND THE WEAK LOW WILL 
HELP INCREASE MOISTURE AND WITH MODERATE INSTABILITY THE CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE THURSDAY NORTH AND ALL AREAS 
FRIDAY AS THE UPPER LOW BECOMES ABROAD TROUGH WITH EVEN MORE
COVERAGE FRIDAY. THE BEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE LATE AFTERNOON AND
EVENING AFTER PEAK HEATING.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEAK UPPER LEVEL
TROUGH SLIDES INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION OVER THE WEEKEND
WHILE A WEAK SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY TRIES TO DROP SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO
VALLEY INTO NORTHERN REACHES OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. MID
SPRING SEASON HEATING IS UNDERWAY NOW SO CONVECTION WILL BE THE
MODE OF PRECIPITATION. WENT WITH A LITTLE HIGHER CHANCE POPS ON
SATURDAY AS BOUNDARY EDGES A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTH WITH UPPER TROUGH
OVER THE AREA. THE WEAKNESS IN THE UPPER LEVEL HEIGHT FIELD DOESN'T
SHIFT EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS UNTIL MONDAY SO MAINTAINED MEDIUM
CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION ON SUNDAY. BY MONDAY THE FORECAST AREA IS
IN BETWEEN SYSTEMS WITH A NICE AMPLIFIED RIDGE IN PLACE AND
THEREFORE DOWNPLAYED PROBABILITY OF PRECIPITATION AT THIS TIME.
GRADUALLY TWEAKED POPS UP TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY AS GENERAL MODEL
AGREEMENT WAS NOTED WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY
TUESDAY AHEAD OF A PLAINS STORM SYSTEM. THE UPPER TROUGH BUILDS
INTO THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BY WEDNESDAY WITH A SYNOPTIC
FRONTAL BOUNDARY FORCING AN AREA OF CONVECTION ACROSS THE REGION
PERHAPS LATER TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. STAYED AROUND THE
MIDDLE OF A MEX/ECM MOS BLEND FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL SUBTROPICAL RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE BEAUTIFUL
WEATHER ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION
TODAY. WITH ABUNDANT SUNSHINE...A PREVAILING SOUTHWEST FLOW AND
INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES...HIGHS TODAY WILL BE EVEN WARMER
/REACHING THE MID TO UPPER 80S IN MANY LOCATIONS ACROSS THE CENTRAL
AND SOUTHERN VALLEY/. AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER THE
SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL TRACK EASTWARD OVERNIGHT AND TRIGGER SOME
SHOWERS AND STORMS ACROSS WESTERN TENNESSEE. HOWEVER...LOCATIONS
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL REMAIN DRY...THOUGH CLOUD
COVER WILL INCREASE FROM WEST TO EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT /PROMOTING
MILDER LOWS IN THE MID TO UPPER 50S/. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/... UPPER RIDGE HOLDS ACROSS
SE STATES UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT WITH INCREASING MOISTURE AND SLIGHT
TO MODERATE INSTABILITY. HOWEVER...APPEARS THAT THE BETTER FOCUS
FOR CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT WILL BE THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO OUR
NORTH ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THUS...DID NOT ADJUST RAIN
CHANCES MUCH UNTIL SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WHEN THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
SAGS SOUTH INTO SE KY TO THE CAROLINAS. WAS TEMPTED TO GO LIKELY
FOR POPS BY THE WEEKEND...NOTING THE INCREASING GFSX MOS POPS TO
LIKELY ACROSS THE BOARD FOR BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.
HOWEVER...NUDGED POPS UP TO HIGH CHANCE WITH SCATTERED WORDING FOR
NOW...WITH THE OPTION FOR DAY SHIFT TO PUSH POPS UP TO LOW END OF
LIKELY IF MODELS ARE CONSISTENT.

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...BOUNDARY LIFTS NORTH AS A WARM FRONT MONDAY... 
LEAVING GENERALLY DIURNAL CONVECTION FOR MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.
CHANCE POPS ALREADY IN THE GRIDS FOR THOSE PERIODS AND LOOKS GOOD 
FOR NOW. GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER ON TIMING OF A COLD FRONT ON TUESDAY
SO BEST TO STICK WITH CHANCE POPS FOR A FEW MORE MODEL RUNS.

TEMPS STAY ON THE MILD TO WARM SIDE WITH LITTLE TARGETS OF 
OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE ON GFSX MOS...SO PREVIOUS MAX/MIN TEMP GRIDS 
WERE ADJUSTED VERY CLOSE TO THE 15/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS.

AT THE SURFACE AND ALOFT HAS SETTLED OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES THIS
AFTERNOON. A FEW WARM ADVECTION CLOUDS MOVED ACROSS THE NORTHERN
SECTIONS THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON BUT SKIES NOW ARE MOSTLY
CLEAR. AT MID AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE UPPER 60S TO MID
70S WITH THE PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENING BETWEEN A SURFACE LOW IN
SOUTH CENTRAL CANADA AND HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE GULF COAST. LOWS
TONIGHT WILL BE MUCH WARMER IN THE 50S WITH SOME LIGHT SOUTHWEST
WINDS CONTINUING. WEDNESDAY WITH DRY AIR MASS STILL IN PLACE...FULL
SUN AND SOUTHWEST WINDS TEMPERATURES WILL REACH WELL INTO THE 80S.
DEW POINTS SHOULD STAY IN THE UPPER 40S TO MID 50S WITH RH VALUES
AS LOW AS 25 PERCENT IN THE MOUNTAINS. WINDS HOWEVER WILL NOT BE
STRONG ENOUGH FOR RED FLAG CONDITIONS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...AFTER A DRY START 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...MOISTURE WILL BE INCREASING ACROSS THE AREA AS A 
WEAK UPPER TROUGH APPROACHES AND A WEAK COLD FRONT SAGS SOUTH TOWARD 
THE AREA THURSDAY.  THE FRONT IS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE IT THIS FAR 
SOUTH HOWEVER. WHILE CAPE VALUES ARE EXPECTED TO STAY LOW...AND 
FORCING IS EXPECTED TO BE WEAK...STILL LOOKS LIKE CHANCE POPS ARE 
WARRANTED NORTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. LATEST GFS/CMC MODELS SHOW A 
SHORT WAVE BRUSHING NORTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA SATURDAY/SAT 
NIGHT...SO WILL CARRY HIGHEST POPS NORTH BOTH PERIODS.  UPPER RIDGE 
FORECAST TO BE OVER THE AREA LATE IN THE PERIOD...BUT WITH MOISTURE 
FORECAST TO LINGER OVER THE AREA SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WILL KEEP 
SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS GOING. FORECAST CONFIDENCE NO

AND COUNTIES ALONG THE TN-NC LINE. ADDED OUR SW NC COUNTIES PLUS ERN 
PARTS OF POLK AND MONROE COUNTIES TO THE FROST ADVISORY FOR THIS

OTHERWISE...NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF CHANGES MADE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS... 
AS THE UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD EASTWARD THROUGH TONIGHT. THE 
SURFACE RIDGE WILL SLIP EAST AND ALLOW A SW GRADIENT TO STRENGTHEN

FAVORS THE NAM MOS MINS OVER THE COOLER GFS MOS. EXPECTING MAX TEMPS 
TODAY TO BE ABOUT 4 TO 8 DEGREES WARMER THAN MONDAY.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...AN UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL
BUILD INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY... PROMOTING SOME OF THE WARMEST
TEMPERATURES OF THE SPRING AS THE MERCURY SHOULD CLIMB INTO THE MID
TO UPPER 80S IN MANY LOCATIONS /ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE
CENTRAL/SOUTHERN VALLEY/. WHILE THE INFLUENCE OF HIGH PRESSURE
REMAINS INTACT LATE THIS WEEK INTO NEXT WEEK...SOME GULF MOISTURE
WILL GET PULLED UP INTO THE REGION BY THURSDAY. THIS WILL COINCIDE
WITH A SERIES OF UPPER-WAVES THAT WILL PROPAGATE ACROSS THE OHIO
VALLEY ON THE NORTHERN PERIPHERY OF THE AFOREMENTIONED RIDGE.
THIS...ALONG WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME DIURNALLY DRIVEN
CONVECTION WILL GIVEN THE REGION A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD. SOME BETTER CHANCES MAY BE IN
STORE FOR MONDAY AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION.
HOWEVER...BASED ON MODEL FLUCTUATIONS THAT FAR OUT... OPTED TO BE

AND UPPER 30S. THINK THERE WILL BE EVEN LESS AREA AFFECTED BY FROST 
TONIGHT SO WILL NOT ISSUE A FROST ADVISORY BUT KEEP IT IN THE 
WORDING IN THE ABOVE MENTIONED AREAS.

GENERALLY HAVE TEMPERATURES A COUPLE DEGREES WARMER IN THE NORMALLY 
COLD SPOTS TONIGHT AND UP TO 5 DEGREES WARMER ELSEWHERE. TUESDAY 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTER SHIFTS EAST WITH GOOD SOUTHWEST FLOW WARMING 
TEMPERATURES ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE TODAYS EXPECTED HIGHS. THE 
COOLER MET GUIDANCE WAS FOLLOWED WITH HIGHS NEAR 70 HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF SW VA TO NEAR 80 AT CHA. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER RIDGE AND 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SHOULD PROVIDE DRY CONDITIONS INTO WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT.  MODELS SHOW INCREASED MOISTURE FROM THURSDAY THROUGH THE END 
OF THE PERIOD.  MODELS DO NOT AGREE ON THE DETAILS...BUT A BROAD AND 
SHALLOW UPPER TROUGH FORECAST TO TRAVERSE THE AREA...THEN PERHAPS 
SOME BRIEF RIDGING SUNDAY AHEAD OF A MORE SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH 
AND COLD FRONT THAT MAY BE APPROACHING BY MONDAY.  GIVEN THE 
UNCERTAINTY OF ANY SMALLER SCALE FEATURES BUT WITH THE INCREASED 
MOISTURE IN PLACE...WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE/LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY TIME 
FRAME.  FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS ABOVE AVERAGE EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD...BUT FALLS A BIT BELOW AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR BY THE 
END OF THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NICE WEATHER IN STORE AFTER
SOME PATCHY FROST THIS MORNING. HOWEVER...07Z TEMPS WERE IN GENERAL
RUNNING ABOUT 2 TO 4 DEGREES ABOVE HOURLY GRIDS...EVEN WHERE WINDS
WERE CALM AND NO CLOUDS. OUTLYING RURAL AREAS PROBABLY DROP ENOUGH
TO HAVE AT LEAST PATCHY FROST BY DAYBREAK...SO WILL KEEP THE FROST

FROST STILL THE ONLY WEATHER STORY FOR TONIGHT...WITH MINS TONIGHT
NOT AS COOL THEN MUCH WARMER BY TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE SURFACE RIDGE
MOVES FURTHER SE. TIME HEIGHTS AND SOUNDINGS SHOW A SLIGHT INCREASE
IN MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS AFTER 06Z TUESDAY...SO NOT LIKELY TO
SEE ENOUGH FROST TO WARRANT ISSUING ANOTHER FROST ADVISORY AT THIS
POINT. 

OTHERWISE...WENT QUITE CLOSE TO GFS MOS MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY.
FAVORED THE COOLER MINS JUST WHERE PATCHY FROST WAS POSSIBLE AND
MILDER MOS MINS IN WRN AND SRN AREAS...WHERE SOME WEAK LOW LEVEL
WARMING OCCURS LATE TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AFTER ANOTHER COOL MORNING
ON TUESDAY...WARM-UP BEGINS WITH VALLEY HIGHS OF 75-80 TUESDAY
AFTERNOON. MUCH MORE SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES FOLLOW WITH WITH
VALLEY LOWS IN THE 50S AND 60S AND HIGHS IN THE 80S FOR THE REST OF

310 PM EDT SUN MAY 12 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...PATCHY FROST IS POSSIBLE
TONIGHT AS OVERNIGHT MINS WILL APPROACH THE LOWER TO MID 30S ACROSS
THE MAJORITY OF OUR CWA. THE BIG QUESTION IS STILL THE WINDS. WINDS
MAY BE RELUCTANT TO DROP OFF COMPLETELY WHICH MAY PROHIBIT
WIDESPREAD FROST DEVELOPMENT. IF THE WINDS DO NOT COMPLETELY
SUBSIDE...THEN FROST WILL LIKELY BE MORE LOCALIZED TO SHELTERED
AREAS THAT ARE PROTECTED FROM WINDS. SOUNDINGS INDICATE ELEVATIONS
ABOVE 4500 FEET WILL SEE NEAR FREEZING TEMPS WHILE AREAS AROUND
5000 FEET WILL APPROACH THE UPPER 20S. MINS TONIGHT WILL BE CHILLY
ENOUGH TO BE CLOSE TO RECORD LOWS FOR MAY 13TH.

A PLEASANT DAY IS IN STORE FOR MONDAY. HIGHER PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO 
BUILD IN AS THE DEEP LONG-WAVE TROUGH PUSHES FURTHER EAST. 
HOWEVER...TEMPS ARE STILL EXPECTED TO BE ROUGHLY 10 DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD UPPER TROUGH 
SHIFTS EAST TO OFF THE EAST COAST BY TUESDAY. ONE MORE COLD NIGHT 
MONDAY NIGHT WITH LOWS MID TO UPPER 30S SHELTERED HIGHER VALLEYS IN 
THE MOUNTAINS AND NE TN AND SW VA. COULD BE A LITTLE MORE FROST 
EARLY TUESDAY THEN MUCH WARMER TEMPERATURES AS RIDGING ALOFT OVER 
THE WESTERN STATES SHIFTS EAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA. A WEAK WARM 
FRONT PASSES THROUGH TUESDAY WHICH MAY PRODUCE SOME LOW AND MOSTLY 
MID LEVEL CLOUDINESS BUT NO SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL. EVEN WARMER 
TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY IN THE MID 80S AND CONTINUED DRY CONDITIONS. 
HIGH PRESSURE AREA CENTER SHIFTS EAST AND SOUTHEAST TO THE EASTERN 
GULF COAST WITH A GOOD SOUTHERLY FLOW OF MOISTURE. DEWPOINTS WILL 
RISE AND THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF MAINLY DIURNAL SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FROM THURSDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...OVERALL PATTERN SHOWS A MAIN FRONTAL PASSAGE GOING 
THROUGH THIS EVENING WITH A SECONDARY FRONT PUSHING IN LATE 
TONIGHT.  THIS WILL GENERATE ANOTHER ROUND OF ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION TRACKING THROUGH THE MRX CWA OVERNIGHT.  BEST CHANCE 
WILL BE OVER NORTHERN LOCATIONS WHERE THE BEST LIFT WILL BE 
CENTERED.  WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING...AIR MASS HAS 
STABILIZED...REDUCING THUNDER CHANCES AND ALLOWING MAINLY SHOWER 
ACTIVITY THROUGH THE NIGHT.  ALL HANDLED WELL IN THE CURRENT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...FOR TONIGHT...A DEEP LONG-WAVE
TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO SINK SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.
AN ASSOCIATED SECONDARY COLD FRONT WILL ACCOMPANY THE TROUGH AND
APPROACH OUR AREA AROUND THE 06Z TIME-FRAME. SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS THE NORTHERN AREAS WITH LOW END CHANCE POPS
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IN ANTICIPATION OF FRONTAL PASSAGE. ANY
PRECIP THAT FALLS WOULD BE VERY LIGHT. NOT OVERLY CONFIDENT THAT
PRECIP WILL EVEN DEVELOP AS LIFT IS LACKING. WOULD NOT RULE OUT
SOME PATCHY AREAS OF FOG LATE TONIGHT...MAINLY WHERE RAIN OCCURS
TODAY. HOWEVER...WITH WINDS EXPECTED TO STAY UP AND LINGERING CLOUD
COVER...FOG SHOULDN'T BE A BIG ISSUE. TOMORROW LOOKS TO BE A MUCH
NICER DAY AS DRIER AND CLEARER CONDITIONS RETURN AS THE FRONT WILL
BE OFF TO OUR EAST. HOWEVER...COOLER AIR WILL SPILL IN BEHIND THE
FRONT...RESULTING IN MAX TEMPS ROUGHLY 10 T0 15 DEGREES BELOW
NORMAL ON SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
PERIOD STARTS OFF UNSEASONABLY COOL...MAY BE LOOKING AT PATCHY FROST 
MONDAY MORNING AND TUESDAY MORNING. NEAR RECORD LOWS ESPECIALLY 
MONDAY MORNING...LESS POSSIBLE FOR TUESDAY MORNING. WARM UP OCCURS 
TOWARD MIDWEEK WITH TEMPS FLIRTING WITH LOWER 80S. RIDGE WILL SLOWLY 
BREAKDOWN AND ALLOW DIFFUSE TROUGHING ALOFT...WITH MAINLY SCATTERED 
CONVECTION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY.

MOVES EAST THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. AN ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM CAN'T BE 
RULED OUT...BUT CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IN TAFS. LATE

AGAIN...MAINLY IMPACTING FROM TYS AND NORTH. THERE COULD BE A SPOTTY 
SHOWER OR TWO WITH THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE...ESPECIALLY TOWARD TRI...BUT 
CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO INCLUDE IN THIS ISSUANCE. TRI COULD 
SEE SOME PATCHY FOG LATE TONIGHT...SO BROUGHT THEM DOWN TO 5SM FOR A

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A FEW SHOWERS CONTINUE OVER THE
PLATEAU...SE KY AND SW VA AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. BETTER COVERAGE
OF CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION WAS NOTED ALONG THE COLD FRONT...AND
MODELS GENERALLY SUPPORT LIKELY POPS FOR TODAY OVER SW VA AND NE
TN. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS RELFECTED THIS VERY WELL AND WERE
CLOSELY FOLLOWED. SOUNDINGS SUGGEST A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS WITH
HIGHER INSTABILITY THIS MORNING INTO THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS.
UNDERCUT MAX TEMPS JUST A COUPLE OF DEGREES OR SO...ALTHO MILD MINS
WERE IN PLACE AT 07Z ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

FOR TONIGHT...A MENTION OF SHOWERS AFTER 12/06Z MAY NOT BE NEEDED
AND LATER SHIFTS MAY BE ABLE TO DROP THE SHOWERS. WOULD NOT RULE
OUT SOME PATCHY AREAS OF FOG LATE TONIGHT...MAINLY WHERE RAIN
OCCURS TODAY. THE DEGREE OF CLEARING IS REASONABLE FOR ALL BUT NE
AREAS...AND THE SIMILAR MOS MINS LOOKED ON TRACK. 
 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRY NORTHWEST FLOW AND 
SURFACE RIDGING WILL START THE EXTENDED FORECAST FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE PATCHY/AREAS OF FROST ACROSS MOST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT AND NORTHEAST SECTIONS/MOUNTAINS FOR 
MONDAY NIGHT.

BY TUESDAY...THE SURFACE RIDGE MOVES EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WITH
RETURN OF SOUTHERLY FLOW PRODUCING WARM AIR ADVECTION AND WEAK
ISENTROPIC LIFT. HAVE INCREASED CLOUD COVER FOR TUESDAY AND
WEDNEDAY..BUT CHANCE OF SHOWERS ARE MINIMAL DUE TO LACK OF GULF
MOISTURE RETURN.

FOR THURSDAY...GULF MOISTURE FINALLY MOVES INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
WITH INSTABILITY AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT PRODUCING ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
(HIGH TERRAIN) DURING THE AFTERNOON/EVENING. FOR FRIDAY...COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA WITH CHANCE OF STORMS AREA-WIDE. ONCE TIMING 
OF FROPA BECOMES CLEARER...CHANCES OF CONVECTION WILL INCREASE FOR 
LATE IN THE WEEK.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFX MOS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONVECTION OCCURRING OVER THE 
LOWER MS VALLEY REGION HAS A CHANCE TO REACH OUR WRN MOST COUNTIES 
TOWARD DAYBREAK. HOWEVER...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON THIS 
ACTIVITY WEAKENING...SO I SLOWED DOWN THE ONSET OF SHOWERS AND TSRA 
A BIT. FORECAST SOUNDINGS ARE UNSTABLE THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND ALSO
TONIGHT...SO CARRIED TSRA EXCEPT FOR A FEW HOURS EARLY TODAY.  

PATCHY DENSE FOG HAS SET IN AT TRI AND MAY ALSO BE OCCURRING OVER 
OTHER PARTS OF NE TN INTO SW VA...MAINLY WHERE THE SPOTTY CONVECTION 
OCCURRED ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING. ADDED PATCHY DENSE FOG TO 
WEATHER GRIDS TO ABOUT 14Z TODAY. 

CLOUDS ON THE INCREASE WILL AFFECT MAX TEMP...BUT IF CONVECTION DOES 
DISSIPATE THERE WILL BE ENOUGH SUNSHINE TO REACH THE SIMILAR MOS MAX 
TEMPS. CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODEL AGREEMENT HAS
BEEN TRENDING POORER AS HAS CONSISTENCY...SO THE LONG TERM PERIOD
STARTS OUT WITH A BIT ABOVE AVERAGE FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THIS
TIME OF YEAR BUT THEN GRADUALLY DIPS TO SLIGHTLY BELOW AVERAGE BY
THE END OF THE PERIOD. A COLD FRONT WILL EXIT THE AREA
SATURDAY...TO BE FOLLOWED BY A SECONDARY COLD FRONT LATE SATURDAY
NIGHT. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EARLY
SATURDAY THEN TRENDING DRIER DURING THE DAY. THE SECONDARY COLD
FRONT WILL NOT HAVE A LOT OF MOISTURE TO WORK WITH SO JUST SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS SOUTH TO LOW CHANCE NORTH LATE SAT NIGHT.
MAY BE A LINGERING SHOWER EAST EARLY SUNDAY...THEN SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL BE BUILDING IN LATER SUNDAY INTO MONDAY TO BE
FOLLOWED BY AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BY MIDWEEK. IT WILL BE COOL SUNDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE UPPER LOW THAT HAS BEEN 
GENERATING THE ISOLATED/SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE REGION RECENTLY 
IS SLOWLY EXITING THE AREA.  ANY LINGERING SHOWERS SHOULD END BY 
SUNRISE AND WILL THEREFORE KEEP THE FORECAST DRY FOR THE MORNING

POSSIBLE BUT ALL SHOULD DISSIPATE AROUND MID MORNING.  THROUGHOUT THE

OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT.  THE AIR MASS WILL BECOMING WEAKLY 
UNSTABLE AND MAY SEE SOME ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION DEVELOP DURING

MAY DEVELOP OVER THE AREA IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT TOWARDS MORNING.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIR 
AGREEMENT AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY IS NOT TOO BAD...SO AVERAGE 
FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THE LONG TERM.  A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
APPROACH FRIDAY AND WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA SATURDAY.  WITH QUITE 
A BIT OF MOISTURE TO WORK WITH AND SOME INSTABILITY STILL LOOKS LIKE 
LIKELY POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WARRANTED FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
INTO SATURDAY.  DRIER AND COOLER AIR WILL BE MOVING IN SUNDAY SO 
JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS EASTERN ZONES EARLY.  SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE FORECAST TO BE IN CONTROL FOR THE MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY

SHOWERS STILL PINWHEELING AROUND UPPER LOW. SOME PERCENTAGE OF
THESE SHOWERS WERE MAINLY SUSTAINED BY SURFACE HEATING AND ARE
DISSIPATING...BUT FARTHER NORTH SOME OF THESE SHOWERS MAY BE ABLE

COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION. THIS FRONT WILL SERVE IS A FOCUS FOR 
SOME ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ON FRIDAY AND PERHAPS INTO 
SATURDAY DEPENDING ON THE TIMING. THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE SLIGHT MORE 
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE...SHOWING A BULK OF THE 
PRECIPITATION EXITING THE REGION BY SATURDAY MORNING/MIDDAY. THE NAM 
IS A BIT SLOWER...SHOWING SOME HEAVIER ROUNDS OF SHOWERS LINGERING 
ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH SATURDAY EVENING. GIVEN THAT ALL SOLUTIONS 
INDICATE A GOOD POTENTIAL FOR PRECIPITATION FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND 
NIGHT...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY AREAWIDE AND WAS A LITTLE 
SLOWER ON CLEARING THEM ON SATURDAY. A FEW SCATTERED SHOWERS ALONG 
WITH SOME COOLER CONDITIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE ON SUNDAY AS A 
SECONDARY WAVE MOVES THROUGH IN RESPONSE TO A STRONG STORM SYSTEM 
TRACKING ACROSS SOUTHERN CANADA. HOWEVER...HEADING INTO NEXT WEEK 
DRIER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AS AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS BEGINS TO MOVE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER NORTHWEST NC...WITH AREA 
RADARS REVEALING SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION NEAR IT OVER SOUTHWEST VA 
AND NORTHEAST TN. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A DEEP UPPER- 
LEVEL CUT-OFF LOW OVER THE CAROLINAS WILL SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHWARD 
TONIGHT...AND INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES ON WEDNESDAY. THIS UPPER 
LOW WILL CONTINUE TO BRING DEEP MOISTURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...WITH SOME WEAK INSTABILITY AGAIN DEVELOPING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS. OVERALL...EXPECT 
WEDNESDAY TO BE VERY SIMILAR TO TODAY...WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION EXPECTED TO DEVELOP...BUT ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA 
AND NORTHEAST TN WHICH WILL BE CLOSER TO THE LOW. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS 
AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES 
ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...ONE TROUGH LEADS TO 
ANOTHER. AFTER BOWLING BALL LOW LEAVES THE U.S. THURSDAY...NEXT EAST 
COAST TROUGH BUILDS IN FROM CANADA BEGINNING THIS WEEKEND AND 
REMAINS ENTRENCHED UNTIL TUESDAY. BEYOND OUR FORECAST PERIOD...BRIEF 
RIDGING FOR THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK WILL SURRENDER TO YET ANOTHER 
EAST COAST TROUGH BY NEXT FRIDAY.

BEST CHANCE OF RAIN IS EXPECTED FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY AS COLD 
FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THE WEEKEND TROUGH WILL DRAW UP GULF MOISTURE

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
THIS AFTERNOON...A LINGERING UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN VALLEY CONTINUES TO PROMOTE WIDESPREAD
CLOUD COVER AND COOLER TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION. HOWEVER...SOME DRY AIR HAS BEEN ENTRAINED INTO THE CENTER
OF THE LOW...RESULTING IN SOME PARTIAL CLEARING/HEATING ACROSS MUCH
OF THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN VALLEY TODAY. THIS HAS ALLOWED TEMPERATURES
TO CLIMB INTO THE MID 60S IN THIS AREA...COINCIDING WITH A
CONFLUENT BOUNDARY EVIDENT ACROSS FAR EASTERN KY/SOUTHWEST
VS/NORTHEAST TN AND INTO CENTRAL NC. GIVEN THE DESTABILIZATION OF
THE BOUNDARY LAYER TAKING PLACE /WITH SB/MU CAPES AOA 500-1000
J/KG/ AND THE BOUNDARY IN PLACE...SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNSET. SOME HAIL WILL
BE POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONGEST STORMS /PERHAPS SOME GETTING UP TO
LOW-END SEVERE LEVELS/ GIVEN THE COLD TEMPERATURES ALOFT AND STEEP
LAPSE RATES.

AFTER SUNSET...SOME DECENT CHANCES FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL
LINGER /PARTICULARLY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS/ AS THE UPPER-LOW
GRADUALLY ATTEMPTS TO DRIFT EASTWARD LATER TONIGHT AND INTO THE DAY
ON TUESDAY. ADDITIONAL GOOD CHANCES FOR SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL
EXIST TOMORROW ACROSS THE REGION AS WELL...PARTICULARLY ALONG THE
SAME FAVORED AREA AS TODAY. HIGHS ON TUESDAY MAY BE A TAD
WARMER...MAINLY ALONG THE SOUTHERN ZONES THIS TIME...BUT WILL REACH
THE 60S AREAWIDE.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND
INDICATE THAT THE CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW WILL SLOWLY DRIFT
NORTHEASTWARD AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY. A WARM AND
HUMID AIR MASS WILL THEN LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY
AND THURSDAY...WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING EACH
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THUS...EXPECT SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION
EACH OF THESE DAY. CONVECTION SHOULD INCREASE IN AREAL COVERAGE BY
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION...AND PUSHES A COLD FRONT INTO THE
FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY WITH ANOTHER SECONDARY FRONT ON SUNDAY
MORNING. DRY AND UNSEASONABLY COOL CONDITIONS WILL THEN RETURN FOR
EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY COMPROMISED THROUGHOUT

.DISCUSSION...
A DEEP UPPER-LOW CONTINUES TO SPIN ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION LATE THIS MORNING...MAINTAINING THE
COOL...CLOUDY AND DAMP CONDITIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.
TODAY...MUCH OF THE REGION HAS BEEN DRY SLOTTED THIS MORNING SO
FAR...WHICH HAS RESULTED IN AN OVERALL LACK OF PRECIPITATION OVER
EAST TENNESSEE AND EVEN SOME WELCOME PEEKS OF SUNSHINE FROM THE
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS. HOWEVER...THERE CONTINUE TO BE TWO MAIN AREAS
OF PRECIPITATION OVER THE REGION. THE FIRST IS A HEAVIER BAND OF
SHOWERS DRIFTING WSW ACROSS NORTHERN ALABAMA /JUST TO THE SOUTHWEST
OF OUR SE TENNESSEE COUNTIES/ AND ANOTHER BROAD AREA OF SHOWERS
STREAMING TO THE NORTHWEST OVER FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA ON THE OTHER SIDE OF THE LOW. THIS ACTIVITY IS
EXPECTED TO GRADUALLY WANE AND SHIFT TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE
REGION LATER TONIGHT AND INTO THE DAY TOMORROW AS THE
AFOREMENTIONED LOW GRADUALLY ATTEMPTS TO MOVE EAST. HOWEVER...GIVEN
THE MOISTURE IN PLACE AND THE LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORM
SYSTEM... A REASONABLE CHANCE FOR SOME SCATTERED ACTIVITY WILL
REMAIN IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY
/PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING/.
GIVEN THE CLOUD COVER AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES...HAVE KEPT
TEMPERATURES ON THE COOL SIDE ONCE AGAIN...WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER
50S AND LOWER 60S IN MOST PLACES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE CORE OF THE CLOSED UPPER LOW

THEN OFF TO OUR EAST.  WITH THE COLDER AIR ALOFT PRECIP SHOULD 
BECOME MORE CONVECTIVE.  MAY EVEN BE SOME THUNDER ESPECIALLY THIS

DRIER AIR WORKING IN ESPECIALLY CENTRAL AREAS SO WILL ONLY CARRY 
HIGH CHANCE POPS CENTRAL...LIKELY NORTH AND SOUTH TODAY.  GRADUAL 
DRYING TREND WILL CONTINUE INTO TONIGHT SO NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE 
POPS TONIGHT. MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE FOR THE MOST PART...ALTHOUGH 
WILL TWEAK SOME MIN TEMPS UP A BIT FOR TONIGHT GOING WITH MORE OF A 
MAV/MET BLEND.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS UPPER 
LOW IS IN NO HURRY TO MOVE AWAY FROM THE REGION AND WILL BE THE MAIN 
PLAYER IN EXPECTED WEATHER ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS DEEP MOISTURE 
AND SHORT WAVE ENERGY CONTINUE TO ROTATE AROUND THE PRESSURE SYSTEM. 
DEEPEST MOISTURE AND BEST LIFT IMPACT SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THROUGH THIS PERIOD WITH DECREASING POPS TUESDAY 
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE LOW FINALLY MOVES FARTHER AWAY 
FROM THE FORECAST AREA. WOULD STILL EXPECT A DECENT POSSIBILITY OF 
CONVECTION DURING THE DAYTIME PERIODS WITH NICE POCKET OF COLD AIR 
ALOFT COINCIDENT WITH THE UPPER LOW. A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY IN 
THE FORECAST FOR THURSDAY WITH MODELS TRYING TO SHOW A WEAK SHORT 
WAVE FEATURE BUILDING SOUTHEAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
AHEAD OF A FRONTAL BOUNDARY WHICH WILL BE DROPPING SOUTH INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY LATER THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. BEST GUESS HERE IS 
TO USE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION DURING THIS PART OF THE 
FORECAST. INCREMENTALLY ADVANCE POPS FROM LOW CHANCE ON FRIDAY TO 
HIGH CHANCE ON SATURDAY AS NEXT SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACH THE REGION. UNCERTAINTY AT THIS 
TIME RANGE REQUIRED BROAD BRUSHING A MEDIUM CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
308 PM EDT SUN MAY 5 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER NORTHERN MS WILL TRACK EAST THROUGH THE 
NIGHT AND MONDAY. THE COLD CORE OF THE LOW WILL OSCILLATE ALONG THE 
TN/AL/GA LINE...AND WITH MIDLEVEL TEMPS FALLING...WE WILL TRANSITION 
FROM STRATIFORM PRECIP INTO CONVECTIVE SHOWERS WITH A CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS. SOME LIGHT SHOWERS ARE DEVELOPING NOW OVER E AL/W 
GA...AND WILL SPREAD NORTH INTO THE SOUTHERN VALLEY THIS EVENING. 
WITH SOME STABILIZATION AFTER SUNSET AND THE DRY SLOT 
OVERHEAD...PRECIP CHANCES WILL DROP QUICKLY AFTER MIDNIGHT SOUTH AND 
CENTRAL...WHILE NORTHERN AREAS WILL MAINTAIN A STEADY RAIN UNDER THE 
ATLANTIC MOISTURE FEED. WEAKER LIFT AND DRIER PRECEDING CONDITIONS 
SHOULD PREVENT ANY FLOOD PROBLEMS IN THAT AREA. THE AXIS OF THE 
ATLANTIC MOISTURE FEED ROTATES NORTHWARD AS THE CLOSED LOW MOVES 
INTO NRN AL ON MONDAY. WHILE LIFT WILL BE WEAK BENEATH THE 
LOW...SOME DESTABILIZATION IS SHOWN BY THE MODELS AREA-WIDE MONDAY 
AFTERNOON. WILL HAVE LIKELY SHOWERS AND A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
FOR MONDAY.

WITH NO ADDITIONAL HEAVY RAIN EXPECTED IN THE WATCH AREA...THE
FLOOD WATCH WILL BE CANCELED. OBS OF WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS HAVE
STAYED BELOW CRITERIA...SO THE WIND ADVISORY WILL ALSO BE CANCELED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
PREVIOUS LONG TERM DISCUSSION PRETTY MUCH ON TRACK. MODELS IN
AGREEMENT EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH TYPICAL UNCERTAINTY SEEN IN THE
SECOND HALF OF THE EXTENDED.

MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...OUR WEATHER WILL STILL BE 
UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF THE SLOW MOVING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TO OUR SOUTH. 
DURING THIS TIME-FRAME...POPS WILL GRADUALLY DECREASE FROM SOUTHWEST 
TO NORTHEAST AS THE LOW PROGRESSES A LITTLE FURTHER EAST EACH DAY. 
MOST AREAS WILL SEE VERY LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS DURING THIS TIME AS 
THE MAIN MOISTURE AXIS WILL HAVE SHIFTED TO THE LEE SIDE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS. HOWEVER...WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
LOW WILL PLACE NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA IN A FAVORABLE SPOT TO 
POTENTIALLY SEE 1 TO 2 INCHES OF RAIN THROUGH THIS PERIOD. 
ALSO...DIURNAL HEATING DURING THE DAY ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY COULD 
LEAD TO A FEW POP UP THUNDERSTORMS. CURRENT SOUNDINGS INDICATE CAPES 
RANGING ANYWHERE FROM 500 TO 1500 J/KG DEPENDING ON LOCATION. 

MODELS GENERALLY APPEAR TO BE INCREMENTALLY SLOWING DOWN APPROACH OF 
WESTERN STATES LONG WAVE TROUGH FOR THE LATE WORK WEEK PERIOD WITH A 
HINT OF A SHORT-LIVED RIDGE PUSHING INTO THE AREA ON THURSDAY. THE 
RIDGE SHOULD HELP TO LIMIT CONVECTION...BUT DID ADD IN SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS TO FAVORED TERRAIN AREAS. POPS THEN BEGIN TO INCREASE ONCE 
AGAIN ON FRIDAY AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM THAT WILL ARRIVE JUST IN 
TIME FOR THE WEEKEND. HOWEVER...BETTER LIFT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION 
MAY HOLD OFF UNTIL LATER FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY SO ADJUSTED 
PROBABILITIES ACCORDINGLY. CHANCE POPS CONTINUE INTO SUNDAY AS MAIN 
FRONT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH SOMETIME DURING THE DAY/EVENING. 
SCALED BACK POPS SUNDAY NIGHT TO TRY AND REFLECT PASSAGE OF FRONT. A 
FEW THUNDERSTORMS WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE OVER THE WEEKEND AS 
SOUNDINGS SHOW A LITTLE BIT OF INSTABILITY PRESENT.

EXPECT A GRADUAL WARMING BEGINNING ON TUESDAY WITH TEMPS REACHING THE MID 
TO UPPER 70S BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. SLIGHT COOL DOWN ON SATURDAY 
AND SUNDAY AS CLOUDS AND RAIN CHANCES INCREASE FOR THE WEEKEND WITH 
TEMPS IN THE LOW TO MID 70S.

1044 AM EDT SUN MAY 5 2013

.DISCUSSION...
WV IMAGERY CONTINUES TO SHOW A PLUME OF ATLANTIC MOISTURE FEEDING
INTO THE AREA ON THE NORTHEAST SIDE OF A STATIONARY LOW. IR SHOWS
CLOUD TOPS HAVE WARMED OVER THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA AND
OVER GA...WITH THE COLDEST CLOUD TOPS OVER NORTHERN AREA AND
UPSTREAM OVER NC. SO THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU THAT HAVE SEEN THE MOST RAIN OVER THE PAST 48 HOURS WILL
SEE A BREAK FOR THE NEXT FEW HOURS. MODELS SHOW FRONTOGENETIC
FORCING HAS WEAKENED FROM YESTERDAY AS WELL...SO RAINFALL RATES
ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL AREAS WILL BE LIGHT TO MODERATE
TODAY.

SOME DESTABILIZATION IS FORECAST BY THE MODELS IN SOUTHERN AREAS
LATER THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A LIFTED INDEX IN THE -3 TO -4 RANGE AT
CHA IN NAM AND GFS SOUNDINGS. A SURFACE LOW OVER NORTHERN GA WILL
PROVIDE CONVERGENCE FOR THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT. 

THE CURRENT FORECAST SEEMS TO CAPTURE THESE TRENDS WELL
OVERALL...SO NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES ARE NEEDED. 

OBSERVATIONS OF WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS HAVE BEEN MARGINAL OR JUST
BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. WILL KEEP THE WIND ADVISORY GOING FOR
NOW...BUT WILL LIKELY BE CANCELED LATER THIS AFTERNOON IF CURRENT
TRENDS CONTINUE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE 
ITS SLOW TREK ACROSS THE REGION.  THE BETTER FORCING IS EXPECTED TO 
SHIFT FURTHER NORTH TODAY...WITH SOME DRYER AIR MOVING INTO SOUTHERN 
AREAS.  EXPECT LIGHTER PRECIP FOR A WHILE TODAY IN SOUTHWEST 
ZONES...BUT PRECIP MAY PICK UP AGAIN LATE IN THE DAY INTO TONIGHT AS 
THE SYSTEM DRIFTS EAST.  DOWNSLOPE FLOW SHOULD CONTINUE TO HELP TO 
LIMIT PRECIP AMOUNTS FURTHER NORTH.  WILL KEEP FLOOD WATCH AS IS FOR 
NOW.  WINDS STILL MAY REACH WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA AT TIMES IN SOME 
OF THE EASTERN HIGHER TERRAIN GIVEN THE STRONG SOUTHEASTERLY LOW 
LEVEL JET...SO WILL LEAVE WIND ADVISORY IN PLACE THERE. WILL 
GENERALLY UNDERCUT MAV TEMPS A BIT FOR TODAY...BUT NOT MUCH ARGUMENT 
WITH MAV MIN TEMPS TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS IN LINE EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD WITH TYPICAL UNCERTAINTY SEEN IN THE SECOND HALF OF THE 
EXTENDED. KEPT RELATIVELY HIGH POPS IN PLACE ON MONDAY AREA WIDE 
WITH UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. WITH THE UPPER CENTER 
OVER THE REGION AND A TAD BIT MORE HEATING WOULD EXPECT THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SOME CONVECTION SO KEPT THIS IDEA GOING. TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY THE UPPER LOW SHIFTS VERY SLOWLY NORTHEAST JUST ON THE 
OTHER SIDE OF THE APPALACHIAN CHAIN MAKING IT TO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC 
COASTAL REGION BY 00Z THURSDAY. IN THIS CONFIGURATION WITH 
SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES ROTATING AROUND 
THE LOW KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS GOING ACROSS 
MOST OF THE AREA WITH LIKELY PROBABILITIES ACROSS MUCH OF THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. TAPER POPS 
BACK A FAIR AMOUNT ACROSS THE REGION BY WEDNESDAY WITH DRIER AIR 
BUILDING IN BEHIND DEPARTING UPPER LOW. MODELS GENERALLY APPEAR TO 
BE INCREMENTALLY SLOWING DOWN APPROACH OF WESTERN STATES LONG WAVE 
TROUGH FOR THE LATE WORK WEEK PERIOD WITH A HINT OF A RIDGE PUSHING 
INTO THE AREA AROUND THURSDAY. THEREFORE...PULLED THE SMALL CHANCE 
POPS FOR THURSDAY WHILE DOWNPLAYING CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ON FRIDAY 
DAYTIME PERIOD. THE BETTER LIFT AND MOISTURE ADVECTION MAY HOLD OFF 
UNTIL LATER FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY SO ADJUSTED PROBABILITIES 
ACCORDINGLY.

STRONG 850MB JET WILL BE PERPENDICULAR TO THE APPALACHIAN

247 PM EDT SAT MAY 4 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
REPORTS FROM THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
INDICATE NO FLOODING PROBLEMS THUS FAR...WITH ABOUT 2-3 INCHES 
RECEIVED SO FAR OVER THAT AREA. RADAR PRECIP ESTIMATES SO FAR HAVE 
BEEN EXCELLENT COMPARED TO GROUND TRUTH.

THE SLOW PROGRESSION OF THE UPPER LOW AND A STATIONARY FRONT ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS MEANS THAT A STEADY MODERATE TO OCCASIONALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE TONIGHT OVER THE SAME AREAS THAT HAVE 
ALREADY SEEN SEVERAL INCHES OF RAINFALL TODAY. DOWNSLOPE WINDS WILL 
CONTINUE TO HAVE AN IMPACT ON PRECIP AMOUNTS IN THE CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN VALLEY THROUGH SUNDAY. EVENTUALLY...MODELS SHOW THE 
FRONTOGENESIS ZONE LIFTING NORTHWARD TO KNOXVILLE SUNDAY 
MORNING...WHICH WILL HELP OVERCOME THE DOWNSLOPE DRYING EFFECTS. 
MIDLEVEL DRYING WILL MOVE IN FROM THE SW...SO PRECIP WILL BECOME 
LIGHTER AROUND CHATTANOOGA SUNDAY MORNING AND AFTERNOON. THE AREA 
WITH THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL ON SUNDAY IS EXPECTED TO BE SW NC. THE 
FLOOD WATCH WILL NOT BE CHANGED. OBSERVATIONS OF WINDS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS SHOW GUSTS TO AROUND 30 MPH SO FAR THIS AFTERNOON. GUSTS 
CLOSE TO 40 MPH MAY OCCUR AT TIMES OVERNIGHT...BUT NO WIND ADVISORY 
WILL BE ISSUED AT THIS TIME AS THE MAJORITY OF LOCATIONS WILL STAY 
JUST BELOW CRITERIA.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...
MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH
INDICATING THE CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW DRIFTING EAST-SOUTHEASTWARD
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN PART OF THE NATION. THE CENTER OF THIS
UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO REMAIN SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY
NIGHT AND MONDAY...WHICH WOULD KEEP THE FORECAST AREA ON ITS
NORTHERN SIDE WHERE AN EASTERLY WIND FLOW WILL BRING A GOOD FETCH
OF MOISTURE FROM THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. THUS...WILL MAINTAIN HIGH POPS
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...WITH DECREASING POPS THEREAFTER AS THIS
UPPER LOW DRIFTS TO THE CAROLINA COAST BY TUESDAY. A WARM AND HUMID
AIR MASS WILL THEN LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE MIDDLE OF
NEXT WEEK...WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING EACH
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THUS... EXPECT SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION
TO DEVELOP EACH DAY...WHICH SHOULD INCREASE IN AREAL COVERAGE
TOWARDS THE END OF THE WEEK AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH PUSHES A COLD
FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY
FOLLOWED THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED
PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.DISCUSSION...
THE FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK SO FAR THIS MORNING...AS RAIN
SLOWLY PROGRESSES NORTHEAST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. IT APPEARS THAT
DOWNSLOPE WINDS ARE HAVING SOME EFFECT AS THE RAIN MOVES INTO THE
SHADOW OF THE MOUNTAINS...AS THE RAIN BAND NOW ACROS KNOXVILLE IS
BECOMING MORE RAGGED IN APPEARANCE ON RADAR. ACCORDING TO RADAR
ESTIMATES...SOME LOCATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY HAVE ALREADY
RECEIVED ONE INCH OF RAIN...WHICH IS GENERALLY IN LINE WITH
FORECAST QPF AMOUNTS. THE STEADY NATURE OF THE RAINFALL SUGGESTS
THAT RIVER AND AREAL FLOODING ARE THE MAIN CONCERNS RATHER THAN
FLASH FLOODING. RIVERS THAT ARE OF PARTICULAR CONCERN THROUGH THE
WEEKEND INCLUDE THE SEQUATCHIE...SOUTH CHICKAMAUGA...OCOEE NEAR

330 AM EDT SAT MAY 4 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE SLOW MOVING CLOSED LOW WILL 
CONTINUE TO APPROACH DURING THE PERIOD.  STRONG SOUTHEASTERLY LOW 
LEVEL JET WILL BRING ABUNDANT MOISTURE. PERSISTENT BAND OF SHOWERS 
WILL BRING HEAVY RAINFALL AMOUNTS TO SOUTHERN AND WESTERN ZONES.  
WITH THE WIND FLOW BEING DOWNSLOPE INTO THE VALLEY...RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LESS IN CENTRAL AND NORTHEAST VALLEY 
AREAS. WILL KEEP THE FLOOD WATCH AS IS FOR NOW.  WITH THE STRONG LOW 
LEVEL JET WINDS MAY APPROACH WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR SOME OF THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN AT TIMES...BUT FOR NOW WINDS EXPECTED TO GENERALLY 
STAY BELOW ADVISORY LEVELS SO NO WIND ADVISORY WITH THIS ISSUANCE. 
MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.    

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE "BIG RAINER" IS STILL ON 
SCHEDULE WITH MODELS CLOSE IN AGREEMENT IN A LENGTHY PERIOD OF 
WIDESPREAD LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN AS DEEP MOISTURE IS LIFTED IN THE 
PRESENCE OF A SLOW MOVING VERTICALLY STACKED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. 
PROBABLY NO NEED TO FORECAST ANYTHING LESS THAN ONE HUNDRED PERCENT 
FOR SHOWERS ON SUNDAY AS STRONG LIFT PROGRESSES FROM SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA TO NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA LATER IN THE DAY. THE UPPER LOW MOVES TO NORTHERN 
GEORGIA BY 12Z MONDAY BUT DOES NOT MAKE MUCH PROGRESS NORTHEAST UP 
THE EASTERN SEABOARD DURING THE FOLLOWING 24 HOURS. WITH THE STILL 
DEEP LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM VERY CLOSE TO THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY 
KEPT LIKELY POPS GOING DROPPING BACK INTO THE CHANCE CATEGORY BY 12Z 
TUESDAY AS THE PRESSURE SYSTEM FINALLY MOVES A LITTLE QUICKER IN ITS 
TRACK ALONG THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC COAST. TAPERED POPS BACK TO SLIGHT 
THROUGH LOW CHANCE ON WEDNESDAY. UNCERTAINTY BUILDS DURING THE LAST 
COUPLE DAYS OF THE EXTENDED WITH MODELS HINTING AT A WEAK WAVE 
DROPPING SOUTHEAST BEHIND THE DEPARTING UPPER LOW ON THURSDAY SO 
LEFT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN ON THURSDAY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. LEFT A SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY IN PLACE FOR 
FRIDAY WITH THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TOWARD THE END OF THE 
WORK WEEK. TIMING IS SOMEWHAT OF AN ISSUE WITH THE GFS MORE 
RAMBUNCTIOUS TO BRING LIFT IN AHEAD OF SYSTEM WARM FRONT WHILE ECMWF 
A BIT SLOWER TO ADD PROBABILITY TO THE MIX WITH PRECIP BUILDING IN 
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. IN TERMS OF PRECIP TYPE...ADDED THE 
POSSIBILITY OF CONVECTION BEGINNING MONDAY AND CONTINUING THROUGH 
THE END OF THE PERIOD WITH LIKELIHOOD BECOMING GREATER LATER IN THE 
WEEK AS STRENGTHENING INSOLATION ENCOURAGES GREATER INSTABILITY. 
BLENDED THE ECMWF AND MEX MOS FOR THE TEMPERATURE REGIME.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
247 PM EDT FRI MAY 3 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
THE CLOSED LOW OVER THE MS VALLEY WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY OVER 
THAT REGION BUT GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN TONIGHT. THIS WILL RESULT IN A 
40-50 KT SE FLOW AT 850 MB...WHICH WILL TRANSPORT AN ATLANTIC 
MOISTURE PLUME INTO THE AREA. MODELS SHOW THAT LIFT IS STRONGLY TIED 
TO A FRONTOGENESIS ZONE...WHICH MOVES INTO THE SOUTHERN TN VALLEY BY 
12Z SAT. THE SURFACE FRONT REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY FROM THE SW NC 
CORNER TO AROUND CSV THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. MODERATE TO HEAVY 
PRECIP WILL BE MOVING INTO CHA AROUND THIS TIME. FARTHER 
NORTH...DOWNSLOPE EFFECTS IN THE LEE OF THE MOUNTAINS WILL GIVE 
LIGHT QPF AMOUNTS THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH CHANCE POPS ONLY COMING 
INTO SW VA SATURDAY NIGHT. THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM IS A 
CONCERN FOR FLOODING IN SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS. RAINFALL AMOUNTS 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT ARE EXPECTED TO BE 2 TO 4 INCHES IN THOSE 
AREAS. A FLOOD WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR SW NC...THE SOUTHERN TN 
VALLEY...AND CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS LONG TERM DISCUSSION. THE
GFS AND ECMWF CONTINUE TO BE IN VERY CLOSE AGREEMENT THROUGHOUT THE
EARLY PORTIONS OF THE LONG TERM WITH ONLY SLIGHT DIFFERENCES TOWARD
THE END OF THE PERIOD.

SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY OUR WEATHER WILL STILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE 
OF A STUBBORN CUTOFF LOW THAT WILL TAKE ITS TIME TREKKING ACROSS THE 
STATES JUST TO OUR SOUTH. THE SLOW PROGRESSION IS DUE TO A BLOCKING 
PATTERN OVER NORTH AMERICA. IT LOOKS LIKE AREAS FROM THE CENTRAL 
VALLEY AND SOUTH HAVE BETTER CHANCES OF SEEING HIGHER RAINFALL 
AMOUNTS ON SUNDAY. MEAN FLOW IS IN A SE TO NW ORIENTATION AS WE WILL 
BE POSITIONED IN THE NORTHWEST QUADRANT OF THE LOW. THIS SHOULD 
ALLOW THE APPALACHIANS TO PROVIDE SOME WHAT OF A RAIN SHADOW TO 
AREAS NORTHEAST OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY...THUS LIMITING THE HIGHER 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS THAT WILL LIKELY BE SEEN FURTHER SOUTH. PRECIP 
EFFICIENCY LOOKS OKAY FOR THIS EVENT BUT I THINK THE HIGHER AMOUNTS 
ARE GOING TO BE DUE TO MORE OF A DURATION TYPE CAUSE THAN PRECIP 
EFFICIENCY. WARM-LAYER CLOUD DEPTHS ARE ROUGHLY 8000 TO 
9000FT...WHICH IS WHAT WE WANT FOR HIGH EFFICIENCY...BUT CLIMATOLOGY 
SUGGEST PWS ARE MARGINAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR ALONG WITH A LACKING 
AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY. SOUNDINGS INDICATE PWS MAXING OUT JUST OVER 1 
INCH...WHICH PUTS US AROUND THE 50TH PERCENTILE BASED ON CLIMO. 
HOWEVER...BECAUSE OF THE SLOW PROGRESSION OF THE SYSTEM...DURATION 
ALONE SHOULD ALLOW AN ADDITIONAL 1 TO 2 INCHES TO FALL ACROSS AREAS 
GENERALLY SOUTH OF THE CENTRAL VALLEY ON SUNDAY...ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST NC. I THINK PWS ARE ON THE LOW SIDE BECAUSE THE MOISTURE 
FETCH IS NOT A PURE SOUTHERLY GULF FETCH. IT IS A ATLANTIC/GULF 
COMBINATION. DEEP OMEGA AND ROBUST VORTICITY WILL MAINTAIN A STEADY 
GENERATION OF SHOWERS THROUGH MOST OF THE DAY ON SUNDAY.

SHOWERS THEN CONTINUE INTO MONDAY...BUT AMOUNTS AND INTENSITY WILL 
DECREASE AS THE LOW MOVES FURTHER EAST. A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE POSSIBLE ON MONDAY AS 500 J/KG OF CAPE ARE PRESENT IN SOUNDINGS. 
HIGHER PRESSURE EDGES TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY WITH A DECREASING CHANCE FOR CONVECTION AS FURTHER DRYING 
CONTINUES. WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED LOOK GENERALLY 
DRY...EXCEPT FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF ISOLATED TERRAIN BASED 
CONVECTION ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. WENT SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE ON 
TEMPS THROUGH EARLY PERIODS BECAUSE OF INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND 
SHOWERS. TEMPS WILL GRADUALLY BEGIN TO WARM BY TUESDAY AND CONTINUE 
TO WARM THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER THE 
NORTHEAST US...WHILE A CLOSED LOW WILL SLOWLY MOVE TOWARD OUR 
REGION.  MOISTURE WILL INCREASE AS LOW LEVEL SOUTHEAST FLOW 
STRENGTHENS...BUT DOWNSLOPING IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY 
AREAS AND THE SLOW MOVEMENT OF THIS SYSTEM SHOULD PRECLUDE ANY RAPID 
SPREADING OF PRECIP ACROSS THE AREA.  WILL JUST CARRY CHANCE POPS 
SOUTH ZONES TODAY...WITH LIKELY TO LOW CAT POPS FAR SOUTHWEST ZONES 
TONIGHT DECREASING TO BELOW SLIGHT CHANCE NORTHEAST. INSTABILITY 
LOOKS VERY LIMITED SO WHILE A FEW RUMBLES OF THUNDER CANNOT BE 
COMPLETELY RULED OUT WILL NOT CARRY ANY THUNDERSTORMS IN THE 
FORECAST FOR NOW.  WINDS WILL BE GUSTY AT TIMES AND TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD BE CLOSE TO NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.  JUST SOME MINOR 
TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS.   

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...00Z GFS AND ECMWF VERY 
CLOSE IN THE EARLY PORTION OF THE LONG TERM AND FOLLOWED AS THE 
SEASON OF SLOW MOVING UPPER LEVEL CLOSED LOWS HAS BEGUN. IT WILL 
TAKE TWO FULL DAYS FOR THE UPPER LOW TO MOVE FROM ARKANSAS TO 
NORTHERN GEORGIA IN A BLOCKED PATTERN OVER NORTH AMERICA. 
INCREASINGLY MOIST AIR...COMPLIMENTS OF THE GULF OF MEXICO AND THE 
ATLANTIC OCEAN WILL BE LIFTED IN A BROAD AREA OF SHOWERS CONTAINING 
MODERATE RAIN AT TIMES. MODELS INDICATE A BIT OF A SHADOW ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE DURING THE DAY SATURDAY 
BUT EVENTUALLY BRING HIGHER PROBABILITY OF RAIN TO THIS AREA 
SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE STORM SYSTEM PRESSES INTO DIXIE. STAYED WITH 
RELATIVELY HIGH POPS SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT WHICH MAY 
BE THE WETTEST PERIOD WITH BEST LIFT AND HIGHEST MEAN RELATIVE 
HUMIDITY IN THE WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN AHEAD OF THE STACKED LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM. BY MONDAY THE LOW MAY BE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
A STRONG RIDGE WILL REMAIN OVER THE EAST COAST...WHILE A CLOSED LOW 
MOVES FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE MS VALLEY REGION BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 
WITH THE PATTERN BEING SLOW TO EVOLVE...WILL FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE 
FORECAST FOR TONIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING. AS THE LOW TRACKS INTO THE 
MS VALLEY...THE SE FLOW WILL STRENGTHEN AND BRING INCREASING 
MOISTURE FROM THE ATLANTIC INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. A 
CONFLUENT 850 MB FLOW AND FRONTOGENESIS WILL DEVELOP LATE IN THE DAY 
ACROSS NRN GA AND NRN AL. THE GFS IS FASTER TO SPREAD PRECIP NE THAN 
THE NAM...BRINGING PRECIP WELL UP THE VALLEY BETWEEN 18Z AND 00Z. 
GIVEN THE EXPECTED 40-50 KT DOWNSLOPE WINDS AT 850 MB...THIS SEEMS 
TOO AGGRESSIVE...SO WILL BRING IN CHANCE POPS TO JUST THE SOUTHERN 
VALLEY/PLATEAU AND SW NC AROUND 21Z.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE WEEKEND...SO CONFIDENCE
FAIRLY HIGH. FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE WEEKEND...A LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM WILL TRACK INTO THE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY BEGINNING FRIDAY
NIGHT. A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW WILL BRING INCREASING
RAIN CHANCES TO THE AREA FRIDAY EVENING...AND REMAIN LIKELY TO
CATEGORICAL THROUGH THE WEEKEND. WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE
AVAILABLE...CAN EXPECT AN INCH TO TWO INCHES MAINLY ON THE PLATEAU
AND SOUTHEASTERN TENNESSEE. DO NOT SEE MUCH IN THE WAY OF
INSTABILITY SO KEPT THUNDER OUT OF THE FORECAST DURING THIS TIME.
GUSTY WINDS CAN BE EXPECTED SATURDAY AND SUNDAY AS THE LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA. UNSEASONABLY COOL TEMPS IN THE
MID TO LOW 60S WILL REMAIN THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...AS COLDER
NORTHERN AIR AROUND THIS FRONT IS ADVECTED INTO THE AREA.

MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACK 
SIDE OF THIS LOW WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES IN THROUGH THE WEEK. LOW 
INSTABILITIES AND LOW SHEAR WILL BE PRESENT THROUGH NEXT WEEK. A 
FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE EACH AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE
NORTHERN GULF/GULF COAST STATES WILL CONTINUE TO PULL THICK
HIGH/MID-LEVEL CLOUDS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS TODAY AND TONIGHT. A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL ALSO
REMAIN MAINLY EST OF AND APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. SOME SCT-BKN 5KFT
CLOUDS WILL ALSO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA AS WELL. EVEN WITH THE
MOISTURE...INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED...SO CONVECTION CHANCES ARE
VERY LOW. WILL MAINTAIN A DRY FORECAST.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...THICK CLOUD COVER WILL NOT ALLOW TEMPERATURES
TO WARM MUCH TODAY. GENERALLY WENT A DEGREE OF TWO COOLER THAN GFS
MOS NUMBERS. LOWS WILL BE MILDER DUE TO THE CLOUD COVER.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH THE HANDLING OF A CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW IN THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...AND GENERALLY SHOW THIS UPPER LOW SLOWLY DRIFTING 
EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. THIS SCENARIO WILL RESULT IN A WET AND UNSEASONABLY COOL 
PATTERN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FOR MOST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD. A 
STABLE AIR MASS WILL RESIDE OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT...BUT THEN SOME WEAK INSTABILITY IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP ON 
SUNDAY AND THEREAFTER AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA.

DOWNSLOPE FLOW HAS KEPT THE TN VALLEY FREE OF CONVECTION

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS 
THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION WHILE LOWER PRESSURE EDGES 
EVER SO SLOWLY EAST ALONG THE WESTERN GULF COAST DURING THE SHORT 
TERM. IN THIS SCENARIO A DEEPENING EASTERLY FLOW DEVELOPS ADVECTING 
MOISTURE ACROSS THE EASTERN SEABOARD. WOULD NOT EXPECT A MAJOR 
INCREASE IN DEW POINT TEMPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE MRX FORECAST AREA AS 
THE SURFACE RIDGE PATTERN WOULD TEND CREATE A WEAK RELATIVELY DRY 
NORTHEASTERLY FLOW DOWN THE VALLEY. THE EASTERLY REGIME WOULD LEAD 
TO A DOWNSLOPING AND DRYING REGIME WEST OF THE APPALACHIANS AS WELL. 
THEREFORE...NOT SURE THE MODELS ARE DOING A GOOD JOB WITH MOISTURE 
FIELDS OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA. OF COURSE...THE MOUNTAINS 
(AND TO AN EXTENT THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU) WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT 
MOISTURE FOR DECENT CLOUD FORMATION WITH UPSLOPE FLOW AND INDICATED 
WEAK INSTABILITY. THEREFORE...FORECAST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER 
OR THUNDERSTORM IN THESE AREAS. DUE TO EXPECTED SLIGHTLY LESS MOIST 
AIRMASS...EDGED MIN TEMPS JUST A BIT BELOW THE COOLEST MOS MINS 
TONIGHT WHILE GOING NEAR TO JUST ABOVE THE WARMEST MOS MAX TEMPS ON 
WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
KEEP PRECIP CHANCES LOW THROUGH THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. LIGHT 
ISOLATED SHOWERS COULD BE POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN EAST 
TENNESSEE EACH AFTERNOON...AS FLOW IS PREDOMINATELY FROM THE EAST. 
AN OMEGA BLOCK HAS SETTLED OVER THE EASTERN US...AND MODELS HAVE 
BEEN TERRIBLE IN AGREEMENT AS TO WHEN THIS HIGH WILL BREAK DOWN AND 
MOVE EAST. WITH ECMWF AND GFS AT OPPOSITE ENDS OF THE 
FORECAST...HAVE SETTLED WITH THE CANADIAN MODEL THROUGH THE WEEKEND. 
THE FLOW AROUND THE TROUGH IS FROM THE NORTHWEST...SO EXPECT THE 
HIGH TEMPERATURES TO REMAIN IN THE LOWER 70S THROUGH THE EXTENDED.

FOR FRIDAY EVENING THROUGH THE WEEKEND...A MID LEVEL LOW WILL 
PROGRESS OUT OF CANADA INTO THE MIDWEST AND THEN EAST NORTHEAST 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. A COLD FRONT WITH THIS LOW WILL CAUSE RAIN 
SHOWERS TO BEGIN AFFECTING THE AREA FRIDAY AFTERNOON...MAINLY IN THE 
PLATEAU AND SOUTHWESTERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COVERAGE 
WILL GRADUALLY INCREASE THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY TO INCLUDE THE 
ENTIRE AREA. EXPECT RAIN SHOWERS EACH PERIOD WITH THUNDERSTORMS 
POSSIBLE SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH NEXT TUESDAY. THE GRADIENT WITH 
THIS FRONT IS NOT AS STRONG AS PREVIOUS MODEL RUNS...SO WIND THREAT 
NOT A BIG CONCERN.  THE HIGH PRESSURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS OMEGA 
BLOCK LOOKS TO KEEP AN INFLUENCE OVER THE AREA WITH DRY MID LEVEL 
AIR PROMINENT EACH DAY. THIS IN TURN WILL KEEP SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS AT A MINIMUM...WITH SEVERE THREATS EXTREMELY LOW. 
CONFIDENCE LOWERS EACH DAY THROUGH THE EXTENDED DUE TO MODELS 
CONTINUING TO DIVERGE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MID ATLANTIC STATES EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD 
OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS 
OBSERVED OVER THE FORECAST AREA. IT APPEARS THAT FOG SHOULD BECOME 
FAIRLY WIDESPREAD THIS MORNING TOWARDS SUNRISE...AS THESE CLEAR 
SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS COMBINE WITH THE HIGH GROUND MOISTURE FROM 
THIS WEEKEND'S RAINS. WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR FOR A POSSIBLE DENSE 
FOG ADVISORY LATER THIS MORNING...DEPENDING ON HOW WIDESPREAD THE 
DENSE FOG BECOMES TOWARDS SUNRISE. OTHERWISE...TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
ARE EXPECTED TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION 
POSSIBLE OVER THE MOUNTAINS THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING WHERE SOME 
WEAK INSTABILITY IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT 
WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...RIDGING BOTH SURFACE AND 
ALOFT WILL BE THE MAIN PLAYERS IN THE FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH 
FRIDAY. SURFACE RIDGE EAST OF THE SPINE OF APPALACHIANS WILL PRODUCE 
UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE WESTERN CAROLINA MOUNTAINS WITH SOME OF THE 
LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE SPILLING INTO FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS.. 
CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES OF NORTH CAROLINA AND EVENTUALLY INTO 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/PLATEAU. UPPER RIDGING ALOFT AND SURFACE RIDGING 
WILL KEEP THE AIR MASS RELATIVELY STABLE WITH CONVECTION CHANCES 
LOW...SO HAVE LOWERED POPS TO NIL MOST LOCATIONS.

FOR THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...GFS AND ECMWF SHOW AN 
UPPER TROUGH IMPACTING THE WEATHER OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THE 
EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM IS QUITE DIFFERENT WITH THE ECMWF KEEPING 
THE UPPER LOW FARTHER NORTH AND WEST. GENERALLY FOLLOWED THE 
GFS..BUT STILL THE WESTWARD PROGRESSION OF THE ASSOCIATED CONVECTION 
WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA AS UPPER TROUGH IS 
CUT-OFF FROM UPPER FLOW...THUS MOVEMENT IS SLOW. WILL GRADUALLY 
RAISE POPS AREA-WIDE TO HIGH CHANCE. INITIALLY...INSTABILITY IS 
LIMITED DUE TO PERSISTENT RIDGING INTO THE GULF LIMITS MOISTURE 
RETURN NORTHWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. BY LATE SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY...MODELS SHOW ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO INCLUDE THUNDER.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFX MOS TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...HEIGHTS WILL SLOWLY BUILD 
THROUGH THE SHORT TERM FORECAST ALLOWING FOR MORE SUNSHINE AND A 
LITTLE MORE WARMING ON TUESDAY. THERE MAY BE JUST ENOUGH WARMING TO 
COINCIDE WITH A MOIST AXIS IN THE VICINITY OF WEAK INSTABILITY OVER 
SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE 
NORTH CAROLINA BORDER FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE OF A SHOWER. THE OTHER 
FEATURE OF NOTE IN THE SHORT TERM PERIOD IS THE POTENTIAL FOR FOG 
FORMATION AFTER THE WEEKEND SOAKING. THE STILL VERY WET GROUND AND 
POSSIBLE CLEARING SKIES MAY LEAD TO THE FOG BECOMING WIDESPREAD. THE 
QUESTION IS WILL THE FOG BECOME DENSE? CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH AT 
THIS TIME TO ISSUE A DENSE FOG ADVISORY DUE TO THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME OF THE CU FLATTENING OUT INTO A STRATUS LAYER...ESPECIALLY 
NORTHERN SECTIONS LATER TONIGHT. IN THE MOIST OVERNIGHT ENVIRONMENT 
EDGED MIN TEMPS TOWARD THE MIDDLE OF MET/MAV GUIDANCE WHILE STAYING 
CLOSER TO THE SLIGHTLY COOLER MET MOS MAXES FOR TUESDAY.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...HIGHER PRESSURE WILL SET 
UP IN OHIO VALLEY WITH A CLOSED UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE GULF STATES 
TROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK WEEK. EXPECT A DIURNAL SETUP WEDNESDAY 
AND THURSDAY WITH LOW PRECIP CHANCES IN THE MORNING...WITH SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING IN THE AFTERNOON. LOW INSTABILITY WITH 
LACK OF STRONG SHEAR AND UPPER LEVEL FORCING LEAVE THE SEVERE THREAT 
OUT FOR THESE DAYS. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND REMAIN THROUGH THE PERIOD. HIGH TEMPS WILL START OFF 
IN THE 80S WEDNESDAY AND DROP INTO THE 60S FRIDAY AS NEXT LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM AFFECTS THE AREA. 

FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL DIVE DOWN INTO 
THE MIDWEST STATES WHERE THE LOW WILL STRENGTHEN AND THEN SLOWLY 
MOVE NORTHEAST TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES. MODELS IN DISAGREEMENT AND 
TIMING OF THE LOW PRESSURE AFFECTING THE REGION...BUT WENT WITH 
ECMWF AS IT SEEMS TO BE HANDLING THE SYSTEM A LITTLE MORE 
CONSISTENTLY. A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW WILL BEGIN TO 
AFFECT THE AREA FRIDAY EVENING...AS PRECIP CHANCES INCREASE AHEAD OF 
THIS FRONT. AGAIN...FROM LACK OF INSTABILITY AND THE SLOW MOVING 
FRONT...THE SEVERE THREAT WITH THESE THUNDERSTORMS IS VERY LOW. THIS 
FRONT WILL KEEP RAIN CHANCES WITH ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS OVER THE 
AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND. ANOTHER WEAK DISTURBANCE MOVES IN LATE 
MONDAY EVENING.

.AVIATION...QUITE A BIT OF CU AND SC AROUND THIS AFTERNOON WITH A

LEFT LATER IN THE DAY WILL BE THE DECK AROUND SIX TO SEVEN THOUSAND

THE POSSIBILITY OF A SCT-BKN ST LAYER AROUND TWO TO THREE THOUSAND
FEET IN PLACE WHICH WOULD TEND TO MITIGATE THE INTENSITY OF THE
FOG. DECIDED TO KEEP MVFR REDUCTION DETERIORATING TO IFR CATEGORY
FOG AT THE TERMINALS WITH POSSIBILITY OF AN LIFR CEILING AT TRI. OF
COURSE THIS MAY ALSO OCCUR AT TYS AND CHA AS WELL BUT LEFT OUT AT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...A GOOD FETCH OF GULF
MOISTURE CONTINUES TO STREAM IN AHEAD OF THE SLOW MOVING LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM AND WEAK COLD FRONT. TEMPTED TO DROP POPS
CONSIDERABLY OVER NRN PLATEAU COUTNIES...BUT FRONT HAS NOT YET
CLEARED THOSE AREAS AND AIRMASS IS SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AS FAR WEST AS
MIDDLE TN AND CENTRAL KY. OTHERWISE...LOWERING POPS FROM THE NW TO
SE OVERNIGHT AND DROPPING ANY MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS AFTER
MIDNIGHT. TEMPS WON'T DROP MUCH MORE THAN A CATEGORT OR TWO OVERNIGHT.

FLOODING CONCERNS ARE MINIMAL THIS AFTERNOON AND SHOULD BE ABLE TO
LET THE URBAN AND SMALL STREAM FLOOD ADVISORY FOR MARION COUNTY
EXPIRE AT 415 PM CDT. EMORY RIVER AT OAKDALE IS STILL ON THE
INCREASE...BUT NOT EXPECTED TO GO NEAR OR ABOVE THE FLOOD STAGE OF
27.0 FEET. 

MINOR CHANGES FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT WERE TO LOWER POPS...
ESPECIALLY OVER THE WRN AREAS. LOOKS LIKE CLEARING MONDAY NIGHT AND
BOUNDARY LAYER WILL BE MOIST...SO INCLUDED PATCHY FOG LATE. 
LOWERED POPS CONSIDERABLY FOR TUESDAY WITH MAINLY DIURNAL
CONVECTION...WHICH SHOULD BE QUITE SPARSE IN COVERAGE OUTSIDE OF
MTN AREAS. OPTED FOR A MOS BLEND WITH DIFFERING MOS MINS FOR MONDAY
NIGHT. JUMPING INTO THE LOWER TO MID 80S FOR TUESDAY LOOKED A BIT
AGGRESSIVE TO ME...THUS I WENT CLOSER TO THE NOT AS WARM NAM MOS
MAXES.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...PROGRESSION OF LONG
WAVE TRAIN ACROSS THE MID LATITUDES REALLY SLOWS DOWN AROUND THE
MIDDLE OF SPRING WITH CUT OFF LOWS TRUDGING ALONG AT A LEISURELY
PACE. BLOCKING RIDGE OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY WILL
KEEP SLIGHT AND SMALL CHANCES FOR CONVECTION IN PLACE ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCE IN THIS
SCENARIO BEING ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND ALONG THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU. BY FRIDAY THE UPPER TROUGH/CLOSED LOW AND ASSOCIATED
SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL HAVE MADE PROGRESS INTO THE EASTERN
HALF OF THE COUNTRY WITH MOISTURE/INSTABILITY AXIS BUILDING INTO
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. FORECAST HIGHEST CHANCE POPS
FRIDAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE SURFACE COLD FRONT INCHES ITS
WAY ACROSS THE REGION. SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY THE BOUNDARY SLIPS
FURTHER NORTHEAST ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
WHERE POPS WERE HELD A LITTLE HIGHER THAN ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. DIFFICULT
TO SAY EXACTLY WHERE THE CUT OFF LOW WILL END UP BUT MODELS PLACE
THE LOW ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST BY SUNDAY AND A SOUTHERLY LOW
LEVEL COMPONENT WILL KEEP THE AREA SUPPLIED WITH JUST ENOUGH
MOISTURE ALONG WITH SOME DAYTIME HEATING FOR A SMALL CHANCE FOR A
SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM SO KEPT THIS IDEA GOING ON SUNDAY.

FRONT. A SWATH OF HEAVIER RAINS TRACKED ACROSS PARTS OF THE SRN 
VALLEY COUNTIES NE TO TYS...WHERE 2.34 INCHES OF RAIN FELL OVERNIGHT 
AT MCGHEE TYSON AIRPORT. COOP RAINFALL REPORTS ALSO INCLUDED 2.64 
INCHES AT DAYTON AND 2.43 INCHES AT DECATUR. KHTX AND KMRX RADARS
BOTH APPEAR TO BE SHOWING HIGHER RAINFALL ESTIMATES THAN THE 
AVAILABLE RAIN GAGES INDICATE FOR THE PAST 24 HOURS...AS WELL AS 
STORM TOTALS FOR THE WEEKEND. 

SEEING MINOR RISES AT THE EMORY RIVER AT OAKDALE AND THE SEQUATCHIE 
RIVER NEAR WHITWELL THIS MORNING...WITH THE SEQUATCHIE EXPECTED TO 
GET VERY CLOSE TO THE FLOOD STAGE OF 14.0 FEET BY MONDAY MORNING.
FLOOD STATEMENTS ISSUED RECENTLY FOR THESE 2 RIVERS.

FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK WITH OCCASIONAL SHOWERS AND ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE REST OF TODAY. MAY NEED TO LOWER MAX 
TEMP FORECAST GIVEN THE HIGH POPS AND SO MUCH CLOUD COVER.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR EVANSVILLE INDIANA...WITH A WARM 
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHEAST OF IT ACROSS MIDDLE TN AND INTO NORTHERN 
AL. AREA RADARS REVEAL A LARGE AREA OF WEAKENING CONVECTION OVER THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...WHICH WAS SLOWLY MOVING EASTWARD. THIS ACTIVITY 
HAD PRODUCED SOME FLOODING OVER MIDDLE TN EARLIER IN THE NIGHT...SO 
WILL PLAN TO MENTION 'RAIN MAY BE HEAVY AT TIMES' IN THE ZONES. WITH 
THIS CONVECTION EXPECTED TO CONTINUE WEAKENING THIS MORNING...DO NOT 
SEE A NEED FOR A FLOOD WATCH OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT SOME URBAN 
AND SMALL STREAM FLOODING APPEARS TO BE POSSIBLE IN SOME AREAS THIS 
MORNING. THE SURFACE LOW IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE NORTHEASTWARD 
TODAY...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY THIS MORNING... 
WHICH THEN BECOMES MORE SURFACE BASED BY THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...IT 
APPEARS THAT SOME STRONG TSTORMS WITH GUSTY WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE 
TODAY...ALONG WITH SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT MOST CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL SLOWLY MOVING EAST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AXIS 
MOVES OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL 
COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THOUGH SATURDAY)...THE UPPER-TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO 
PULL EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...AND WITH IT THE BETTER 
CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION. HOWEVER...STILL THINK THAT SOME DECENT 
CHANCES WILL EXIST ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND EASTERN ZONES DURING THE 
DAY...BEFORE DROPPING OFF QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET. ABUNDANT GULF 
MOISTURE AND SOME DECENT HEATING WILL ALLOW FOR SOME DIURNALLY 
DRIVEN THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS 
BEGINNING TUESDAY...ALONG WITH WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S TO 
EVEN LOWER 80S IN SOME PLACES DURING THE MIDDLE PART OF THE WEEK. 
HOWEVER...ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS 
WILL DRIVE A COLD FRONT INTO THE REGION ON FRIDAY AND LATE INTO THE 
WEEK. THIS WILL PROVIDE THE AREA WITH SOME GOOD OPPORTUNITIES FOR 
RAINFALL HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND...ALONG WITH NOTABLY COOLER 
TEMPERATURES.

HOWEVER...ATMOSPHERE BECOMING MORE UNSTABLE TO OUR WEST ACROSS W TN
AND NRN MS...WITH A SEVERE TSTM WATCH EXPECTED SHORTLY. EXPECT THIS
CONVECTION TO INCREASE AND SPREAD EAST OVERNIGHT...WITH GOOD
COVERAGE AT LEAST THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. AIR MASS REMAINS SLIGHTLY
UNSTABLE OVERNIGHT...SO CARRIED A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS ALL BUT
NE TN AND SW VA. LOWERED POPS SLIGHTLY FROM W TO E BY SUNDAY
AFTERNOON.

SOME UNCERTAINTY ON HOW WIDESPREAD LINGERING CONVECTION IS BY
SUNDAY EVENING...WITH MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION ON TAP FOR MONDAY. 
MADE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS TO PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS FOR THOSE
PERIODS. GFSX MOS POPS LOOKED A BIT LOW TO ME FOR MONDAY...SO KEPT
CLOSER TO A BLEND OF NAM AND GFSX MOS.

OTHERWISE...CURRENT TEMPS MAY FALL A FEW DEGREES OVERNIGHT...WHILE 
MOS MAXES LOOK A FEW DEGREES TOO WARM EACH DAY. FOLLOWED A MOS
BLEND FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. RAINFALL TOTALS SHOULD END UP IN THE 1 TO 3
INCH RANGE IN GENERAL...SO NO SIGNIFICANT FLOOD CONCERNS AT THIS
POINT.  


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE 
SLOWLY MOISTENING AND DESTABILIZING EARLY IN THE PERIOD ON TUESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY WITH SMALL CHANCE PROBABILITIES FOR CONVECTION EACH 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING. WENT CLOSER TO THE SLIGHTLY FASTER GFS 
WITH A LARGE SLOW MOVING UPPER LEVEL TROUGH/CLOSED LOW AND SURFACE 
FRONTAL SYSTEM BUILDING TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY. THE 
SYSTEM ENTERS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY FRIDAY WITH SLOW

LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH A WARM FRONT 
EXTENDING EASTWARD FROM IT ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
THIS MORNING...WHICH SHOULD GRADUALLY FILL IN ACROSS THE ENTIRE

INSTABILITY DEVELOPING TODAY OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...SO WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION SCATTERED TSTORMS OVER 
SOUTHEAST TN...CENTRAL EAST TN...AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST NC. THE 
ELEVATED NATURE OF THIS INSTABILITY SHOULD KEEP ANY TSTORMS FROM 
BECOMING SEVERE OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT THE GFS MODEL INDICATES 
THAT RAINFALL COULD BE HEAVY AT TIMES LATER THIS MORNING AND EARLY 
AFTERNOON. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO ONLY SLOWLY DRIFT

COVERAGE OF RAIN CONTINUING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA INTO TONIGHT. 
AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AN UPPER-TROUGH MOVING THROUGH 
THE TENNESSEE AND OHIO VALLEYS ON SATURDAY WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE EAST 
ON SUNDAY...AND MAY WELL LINGER INTO MONDAY BEFORE FINALLY CLEARING 
THE AREA. WITH ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE IN PLACE ACROSS THE

THE AREA ON SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY AND MOUNTAIN ZONES/...BEFORE THINGS GRADUALLY BEGIN 
TO TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO EAST ON MONDAY AS THE TROUGH FINALLY PULLS 
EAST. AM NOT EXPECTING ANY WIDESPREAD FLOODING CONCERNS...BUT 
BETWEEN 1-3 INCHES OF RAINFALL SEEMS POSSIBLE THIS WEEKEND INTO 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...SO LOCALIZED MINOR FLOODING OF LOW-LYING FLOOD 
PRONE AREAS WILL CERTAINLY BE A POSSIBILITY. 

THUNDERSTORMS CHANCES WILL PERSIST FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK 
THANKS TO GULF MOISTURE LINGERING ACROSS THE REGION AND A FEW 
SHORTWAVES MOVING ALONG THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. LATE IN THE 
WEEK ON THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY A FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL PUSH THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA...PROVIDING EVEN BETTER CHANCES FOR STORMS TO CLOSE 
OUT THE WORK WEEK. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF SHOW A VERY DEEP CLOSED 
CUTOFF UPPER-LOW OVER THE CENTRAL UNITED STATES LATE NEXT WEEK. 
THOUGH THE TRACK AND INTENSITY ARE STILL UNCERTAIN ATTM...THIS COULD

340 AM EDT FRI APR 26 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WITH A DRY 
AND UNSEASONABLY COOL AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY... 
WHICH WERE MOVING EASTWARD TOWARDS THE TN RIVER VALLEY OUT AHEAD OF 
AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES. HIGH CLOUDS 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO INCREASE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...AS THIS 
SHORT WAVE SLOWLY DRIFTS EASTWARD INTO THE OZARKS REGION BY TONIGHT. 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL INCREASE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...BUT THEY DIFFER ON THE EXACT LOCATION OF 
ANY RESULTING RAIN. WILL GENERALLY TREND THE PRECIP FORECAST WITH 
THE HIGHEST POPS OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
TONIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A VERY STABLE AIR MASS TONIGHT OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL NOT MENTION ANY THUNDER. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL 
QUICKLY OVERSPREAD THE REGION ON SATURDAY AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
SLOWLY DRAGS THROUGH THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. MODELS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING AND SHOW DECENT QPF SIGNALS MOVING IN 
AFTER 12Z AND INCREASING IN COVERAGE DURING THE AFTERNOON...EVENING 
AND INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. THUS...HAVE GONE CATEGORICAL POPS FOR 
SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT GIVEN THIS HIGH CONFIDENCE. THE LATEST 
MODEL RUNS SHOW THE TROUGH LINGERING ACROSS THE REGION ON SUNDAY... 
WITH ADDITIONAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS AND STORMS LIKELY. SO...HAVE 
INCREASED POPS PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE EASTERN AND MOUNTAINS ZONES 
ON SUNDAY. IN GENERAL...1-2 INCHES OF RAINFALL IS EXPECTED THROUGH 
SUNDAY EVENING WITH SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE. THIS 
TROUGH SHOULD EVENTUALLY PULL EAST OF THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY...BUT THE POTENTIAL FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL CERTAINLY 
EXIST INTO THE EARLY TO MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK. MODELS ARE THEN 
INDICATING A CUTOFF LOW TRACKING EAST ALONG THE GULF COAST FROM 
TEXAS ON WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...ALONG WITH ANOTHER UPPER-STORM 
SYSTEM OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES. THE LIFT FROM 
THESE TWO DISTURBANCES WILL COMBINE WITH THE ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE 
IN PLACE TO HELP GENERATE REASONABLE CHANCES FOR CONVECTION EACH DAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH A COLD FRONT POTENTIALLY LOOKING TO 
SWING THROUGH THE REGION ON THURSDAY.

FRIDAY ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE DAY.  STILL APPEARS AREAS OF FROST

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER TROUGH FROM CA 
QUICKLY MOVES INTO MO BY FRIDAY EVENING...THEN MORE SLOWLY CONTINUES 
INTO THE SE WITH WIDESPREAD RAINFALL ASSOCIATED WITH IT FOR THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS WEEKEND. AS THIS TROUGH SLIPS TO OUR EAST SUN NGT 
AND MON...WE MAY SEE DIURNAL CONVECTION CHANCES LINGERING EARLY IN 
THE NEW WORK WEEK.  FCST CONFIDENCE DROPS BY MIDWEEK DUE TO A 
BLOCKING PATTERN BECOMING SET UP OVER THE EAST COAST...AND A 
POTENTIALLY DEEP CUT OFF H5 LOW IN THE PLAINS. MODELS HAVE NOTABLE 
VARIATION OF THE MOISTURE FEED SOURCE INTO THAT CUTOFF. BASED ON THE 
ECMWF/S KS POSITION OF THE MIDWEEK TROUGH/CUTOFF...MOISTURE FLOW 
WILL BE PRIMARILY FROM THE GULF AS PER THE ECMWF...WHICH IS DRIER 
FOR OUR AREA. BUT THE GFS HAS THE CUTOFF OVER THE UPPER MISS RIVER 
VALLEY...AND TAPPING ATLANTIC MOISTURE...WHICH MAY DRAW IT ACROSS 
THE CAROLINAS AND E TN...THOUGH NOT A GUARANTEE. I/LL TRY TO SPLIT 
THE DIFF BETWEEN THE GFS AND MEX POPS...GOING WITH SCATTERED

302 PM EDT WED APR 24 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT MAKING ITS
EXPECTED EASTWARD PUSH INTO AND THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THIS
AFTERNOON. TSRA ARE FEW AND FAR BETWEEN...WITH PROSPECTS FOR
THUNDER BETTER TO OUR NORTH OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WHERE A
VORT MAX WAS TRACKING NE INTO THE ERN OHIO VALLEY. THE LIMITED
INSTABILITY JUST WARRANTED AN ISOLATED TSRA MENTION IN A PRE FIRST
PERIOD GROUPING. BACK EDGE OF SHOWERS IS IN VIEW SO I DROPPED POPS
SIGNIFICANTLY AFTER 02Z THURSDAY. EXPECT DECREASING CLOUDS AFTER
THE EVENING HOURS. TOOK THE PATCHY FOG OUT OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN
AREAS...AS SIGNIFICANT FOG USUALLY DOES NOT DEVELOP RIGHT AFTER
PASSAGE OF A COLD FRONT. FOLLOWED THIS THINKING ALSO IN THE 18Z TAF
PACKAGE. 

PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND TEMPS ONLY ABOUT 5 DEGREES BELOW SEASONAL
NORMALS FOR THURSDAY...AS A SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE BUILD SE INTO THE REGION BY THURSDAY NIGHT.

OTHERWISE...WENT VERY CLOSE TO A MOS BLEND FOR MINS TONIGHT AND
FAVORED THE GFS MOS FOR MAX TEMPS THURSDAY.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A SOUTHERN STREAM 
SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. 
ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL INCREASE LATE SATURDAY SPREADING SHOWERS IN THE 
AREA. AS WAVE MOVES THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...DIVERGENCE 
ALOFT WILL INCREASE STRENGTHENING FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING OVER THE 
REGION. WILL INCREASE POPS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY TO LIKELY 
POPS.

PLENTY OF MOISTURE REMAINS FOR MONDAY ALONG WITH INCREASING 
INSTABILTY. WILL LIKELY SEE SOME TERRAIN INDUCED LIFT PRODUCE MAINLY 
DIURNAL CONVECTION ON MONDAY. FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...A 
LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH MOVES FROM THE ROCKIES INTO THE PLAINS STATES 
WHICH WILL STRENGTHEN AN UPPER RIDGE OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. 
WARMER TEMPERATURES AND GENERALLY DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED. 

AS COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS THROUGH THE PERIOD...EXCEPT WENT A DEGREE 
OR TWO WARMER TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY DUE TO INCREASING UPPER RIDGE.

.AVIATION...CONVECTION MOVING INTO WRN PARTS OF FORECAST AREA 
REACHING CHA AT THIS TIME. A BAND OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED EMBEDDED 
TSRA MAY AFFECT BOTH CHA AND TYS...AND MIGHT BRIEFLY LOWER DOWN TO 
MVFR AT THOSE LOCATIONS THIS AFTERNOON. CARRIED ABOUT A 4 HOUR 
WINDOW OF PRECIPITATION UNTIL FRONTAL PASSAGE OCCURS. KEEPING TRI 
MOSTLY VFR FOR NOW WITH NO MENTION OF VCTS OR TSRA THERE DUE TO 
LIMITED INSTABILITY.

LOOKING FOR VFR CONDITIONS WITH CLEARING OR DECREASING CLOUDS AFTER 
ABOUT 25/02Z. CAN'T RULE OUT PATCHY FOG...BUT SIGNIFICANT FOG IS

.DISCUSSION...CONVECTION OVER WESTERN HALF OF TN HAD WEAKENED
OVERNIGHT...BUT STARTING TO SEE AN INCREASE IN REFLECTIVITY FROM NW
OF NASHVILLE NORTH TO NEAR BOWLING GREEN KY. STILL THE TIMING OF
SHOWERS AND A FEW TSRA WILL BE DELAYED FOR A FEW MORE HOURS...SO
POP/WX GRIDS WERE ADJUSTED.

FORECAST GRIDS WERE FRESHENED AS HOURLY TEMP/DEW POINT TEMP GRIDS
HAD DRIFTED OFF SLIGHTLY DUE TO THE MILD CURRENT TEMPS AHEAD OF THE
FRONT. KEPT MAX TEMPS IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST...WITH SOME
STEADY OR FALLING WORDING FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

LOW LEVEL JET PROGGED TO WEAKEN BY NOON SO NO WIND ADVISORY NEEDED
AT THIS TIME.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
STRONG COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER AND MS RIVER VALLEYS... 
STRETCHING GENERALLY ALONG A LINE FROM DAYTON TO EVANSVILLE TO 
MEMPHIS TO SHREVEPORT. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE EASTWARD 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY...AND SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS. WINDS ARE EXPECTED 
TO QUICKLY INCREASE OVER THE FORECAST AREA NEAR THE FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY...WITH MOST OF THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS 
COLD FRONT OCCURRING BEHIND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK OVER THE FORECAST AREA...SO 
WILL MAINTAIN THE 'SHOWERS WITH SCATTERED TSTORMS' WORDING. RAIN 
SHOULD QUICKLY EXIT THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...WITH MUCH 
COOLER AND DRIER AIR MOVING INTO THE FORECAST AREA BEHIND THE FRONT. 
AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS 
INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST THROUGH FRIDAY. DRY CONDITIONS WITH 
TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL FOR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE SLIDES OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST OVER THE WEEKEND WITH RIDGING 
INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. LOW CONFIDENCE FORECAST FOR 
REMAINDER OF FORECAST WITH SMALL FEATURE TIMING AND MODEL SPREAD 
CONSIDERATIONS. A WEAKLY DEFINED UPPER LOW WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY OVER THE WEEKEND WITH A SERIES OF FLAT SHORT 
WAVES PRESSING EAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. TOP DOWN MOISTURE INCREASE 
WILL COMMENCE AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND. BEST LIFT AND 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL BE SAT AND SAT NIGHT BUT CHANCE 
PRECIPITATION CONTINUES INTO MONDAY. INCREASED SOUTHERLY FLOW AND 
MOISTURE RETURNS TO THE AREA TUESDAY FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF 
CONVECTION. LEANED ON THE COOL SIDE OF TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE WITH 
SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR MOST PERIODS.

OHIO RIVER AND MS RIVER VALLEYS...STRETCHING GENERALLY ALONG A LINE 
FROM INDIANAPOLIS TO PADUCAH TO MEMPHIS TO SHREVEPORT. THIS COLD 
FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY

BOUNDARY...WITH CEILINGS ALSO LOWERING BUT REMAINING IN THE VFR 
RANGES OUTSIDE OF ANY TSTORMS. SINCE THE OCCURRENCE OF ANY TSTORMS 
IS AROUND TWELVE HOURS AWAY...WILL JUST MENTION VCTS AT THE TAF 
SITES FOR NOW. WINDS WILL RAPIDLY DIMINISH AND CEILINGS WILL RISE 
AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING...AS COOLER AND DRIER AIR MOVES INTO THE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG COLD FRONT OVER THE LOWER 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND OZARKS REGION...WITH A WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME SCATTERED 
HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH ADDITIONAL CLOUDS FARTHER 
WEST CLOSER TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THUS...THE OVERALL TREND FOR 
TONIGHT IS FOR CLOUDS TO INCREASE AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES CLOSER TO

415 PM EDT TUE APR 23 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...A RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVING ACROSS THE REGION HAS PROMOTED A BEAUTIFUL WARM AND 
SUNNY DAY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AS TEMPERATURES HAVE 
RISEN INTO THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S BY MID AFTERNOON. THE PLEASANT 
WEATHER WILL BE COMING TO AN END THOUGH AS A COLD FRONT WILL 
APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT AND THEN MOVE ACROSS THE REGION 
TOMORROW BRINGING A LINE OF SHOWERS AND SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TO 
THE AREA. MODELS ARE CONTINUING TO TREND SLOWER WITH THE PASSAGE OF 
THE FRONT...SO HAVE TRIMMED POPS BACK TO BELOW MENTIONABLE LEVELS 
BEFORE 12Z...BEFORE RAMPING THEM UP TO CATEGORICAL FROM WEST TO EAST 
DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY. BY EARLY TO MID EVENING...THE FRONT 
SHOULD BE CLEARING THE AREA...SO HAVE REMOVED THEM COMPLETELY AFTER 
06Z WEDNESDAY NIGHT. GIVEN THE SPEED OF THIS SYSTEM...AM NOT 
EXPECTING ANY PROLONGED RAINFALL/FLOODING CONCERNS. THERE WILL BE 
SOME INSTABILITY TO WORK WITH...AND PERHAPS THE POTENTIAL FOR A 
STRONGER STORM OR DURING THE AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...THIS ACTIVITY 
SHOULD STAY BELOW SEVERE LEVELS AND PRIMARILY BE SHOWERS WITH SOME 
EMBEDED THUNDER MIXED IN.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THURSDAY WILL BE COOL AND 
DRY BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH. HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL DRIFT EAST THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...AND BECOME POSITIONED ALONG 
THE SE COAST ON FRIDAY. A RETURN FLOW OF GULF MOISTURE AND AN 
APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO SPREAD PRECIP INTO THE 
AREA FRIDAY EVENING. THE GFS...ECMWF...AND CMC ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE ONSET OF PRECIP FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH THE STRONGEST LIFT 
PROVIDED BY THE UPPER JET STREAK ON SATURDAY. WITH THE TROUGH BEING 
SLOW TO MOVE THROUGH AND A PROLONGED MOISTURE FEED FROM THE 
GULF...MODEL QPF AMOUNTS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT 
EXCEED TWO INCHES FOR MOST OF THE AREA. FLOODING COULD POTENTIALLY 
BE A CONCERN THIS PERIOD. THERE IS VERY LITTLE INSTABILITY...AND 
WILL ONLY MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY WHEN THE 
LIFT IS STRONGEST. POPS WILL BE IN THE LIKELY RANGE FRIDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT.

MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE ON SUNDAY...WITH THE ECMWF BEING ALONE IN 
DEVELOPING A CLOSED LOW OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES. THE GFS HAS A 
WEAK TROUGH LINGERING OVER THE AREA. WITH EITHER PATTERN LOOKING A 
BIT UNSETTLED...WILL HAVE LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE REST OF 
THE FORECAST. CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

VERY MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS MORNING. A MOSTLY SUNNY

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

253 PM EDT MON APR 22 2013

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
A SURFACE RIDGE HAS CONTINUED TO BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS
AFTERNOON...PROMOTING MOSTLY SUNNY AND DRY CONDITIONS...ALONG WITH
A SUBTLE WIND SHIFT TO THE ESE/SE. THIS HAS HELPED TO ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB INTO THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 70 DEGREES BY
MID AFTERNOON. THE MOSTLY CLEAR AND CALM CONDITIONS WILL PERSIST
OVERNIGHT...ALLOWING SOME GOOD RADITIONAL COOLING TO TAKE PLACE.
TEMPERATURES WILL FALL OFF QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET...BEFORE BOTTOMING
OUT IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S ACROSS THE NORTHERN/CENTRAL VALLEY
AND THE UPPER 40S ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY. WINDS WILL VEER TO
THE SOUTHWEST ON TUESDAY AHEAD OF AN APPORACHING COLD FRONT FROM
THE WEST. CLOUDS MAY INCREASE...BUT GIVEN THE SOUTHWEST FLOW...
INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES AND STILL AMPLE SUNSHINE...HIGHS WILL
CLIMB INTO THE LOW TO MID 70S ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH A COLD FRONT PUSHING INTO THE AREA 
ON WEDNESDAY. FRONTOGENETICAL FORCING AND UPPER DIVERGENCE WILL 
PROVIDE LIFT OVER THE AREA FROM 12Z WED IN THE PLATEAU TO AROUND 21Z 
IN THE MOUNTAINS. NO SEVERE THREAT IS EXPECTED DUE TO THE LACK OF 
INSTABILITY AND POSITION OF THE UPPER JET WELL TO OUR NORTH. WILL 
MENTION A CHANCE OF THUNDER WITH CATEGORICAL SHOWERS. WITH THE UPPER 
TROUGH BEING RATHER BROAD...THE FRONT IS SLOW TO CROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS...SO WILL KEEP SOME CHANCE POPS INTO WEDNESDAY NIGHT.  

DRY WEATHER WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS ARE EXPECTED FOR THE END OF THE 
WORK WEEK. THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE AREA ON 
SATURDAY. THE GFS AND ECMWF CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME SIGNIFICANT 
DIFFERENCES. THE ECMWF SHOWS A SLOWER MOVING CLOSED LOW WITH HEAVY 
QPF AMOUNTS IN OUR AREA SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE GFS HAS 
AN OPEN SHORTWAVE TROUGH THAT MOVES THROUGH SATURDAY AND SATURDAY 
NIGHT. THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN HAS MOST OF ITS PRECIP SATURDAY...SO 
WILL RAISE POPS TO LIKELY THAT PERIOD...WITH CHANCE POPS FOLLOWING 
THROUGH SUNDAY. CONFIDENCE FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY IS LOW WITH THE 
MODEL DISAGREEMENTS AND GENERALLY WEAK FORCING PATTERN.

NOT EXPECTED TO BE WIDESPREAD. MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL
STAY CLOSE.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... AFTER A BOUT OF DRIER
AND SLIGHTLY WARMER WEATHER ON TUESDAY...THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM
PROGGED TO BRING THE REGION SHOWERS AND STORMS WILL MOVE INTO THE
AREA ON WEDNESDAY. GIVEN THAT THE GFS HAS SLOWED DOWN THE
PROGRESSION OF THE COLD FRONT/PRECIP AND HAS COME MORE IN LINE WITH
THE NAM AND ECMWF...HAVE REMOVED MENTIONABLE POPS BEFORE 06Z
WEDNESDAY...AND THEN HAVE LOW END CHANCE POPS BEFORE 12Z.
HOWEVER...HAVE GONE CATEGORICAL POPS DURING THE DAY ON WEDNESDAY AS
ALL SOLUTIONS INDICATE THAT THE GREATEST POTENTIAL FOR SHOWERS AND
STORMS WILL OCCUR DURING THIS PERIOD. THEN...HAVE GRADUALLY TAPERED
THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST AS SOME ACTIVITY COULD LINGER ACROSS THE
EASTERN/MOUNTAIN ZONES THROUGH 12Z THURSDAY. DRIER WEATHER LOOKS TO
BE ON TAP FOR THE END OF THE WORK WEEK BEFORE ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH
MOVES INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES THIS WEEKEND. THE GFS HAS

248 PM EDT SAT APR 20 2013

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY...
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL CONTINUE TO
PROVIDE SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN NORMAL TEMPERATURES TO THE REGION
OVERNIGHT. MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES...DEWPOINTS NEAR FREEZING AND LIGHT
WINDS WILL ALLOW THE TEMPERATURES OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU...ALL
OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND PARTS OF NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE TO DROP
BETWEEN 33 AND 36 DEGREES. THUS A FROST ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED FOR
TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL QUICKLY WARM AFTER SUNRISE SUNDAY. LOOK
FOR SEASONAL AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES AND INCREASING HIGH LEVEL
CLOUDS.

.LONG TERM /SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY/...
WARMER AND DRIER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED EARLIER THIS WEEK AS WINDS 
VEER BACK TO THE SOUTHEAST FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY AND A SURFACE 
RIDGE BUILDS IN. HOWEVER...THE PASSAGE OF AN UPPER-WAVE ON MONDAY 
COULD TRIGGER OFF SOME LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE SO HAVE ADDED SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND ALONG THE MOUNTAINS GIVEN 
THAT THE NAM HAS SHOWN THESE WEAK SIGNALS FOR SEVERAL RUNS NOW. THE 
MAIN WEATHER FEATURE FOR THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK WILL BE A COLD 
FRONT PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY...BRINGING A GOOD 
CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. MODELS ARE IN FAIRLY DECENT 
AGREEMENT ON TIMING...SO THUS HAVE HIGH-END LIKELY POPS FOR THIS 
PERIOD...BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF FROM WEST TO EAST RAPIDLY 
WEDNESDAY EVENING/NIGHT. A BRIEF STINT OF DRY/MILD WEATHER IS 
EXPECTED FOR THE LATER HALF OF THE WORK WEEK BEFORE THE NEXT 
UPPER-TROUGH MOVES TOWARD THE REGION THIS WEEKEND. THIS WILL BRING 
GOOD CHANCES FOR THUNDERSTORMS ONCE AGAIN...BUT GIVEN THE HIGH 
VARIABILITY BETWEEN THE MODELS WITH TIMING...HAVE OPTED TO STICK WITH 
LOWER CHANCE POPS FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...COLDER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO 
PUSH IN TONIGHT BEHIND THE RETREATING COLD FRONT.  PRECIP SHOULD BE 
GONE BY TONIGHT BUT CLOUDS WILL LINGER INTO TONIGHT BEFORE 
DECREASING FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST.  TEMPS WILL DIP INTO THE MID 
TO UPPER 30S ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA IN THE FREEZE PROGRAM. WHILE 
THERE MAY BE ENOUGH WIND AND CLOUDS TO KEEP FROST FROM BEING TOO 
WIDESPREAD...APPEARS THERE IS ENOUGH OF A FROST RISK TO ISSUE A 
FROST ADVISORY FOR THOSE AREAS IN THE FREEZE PROGRAM.  HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BE IN CONTROL SATURDAY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE EXPECTED.  MAV 
TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...COOLER AND DRIER
AIR WILL CONTINUE TO WORK ITS WAY INTO THE REGION IN WAKE OF THE
FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY. WITH CLEARING CONDITIONS AND LIGHT WINDS
SATURDAY NIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL FALL INTO THE MID TO UPPER 30S IN
MANY LOCATIONS...RESULTING IN A HIGHER PROBABILITY OF A FROST. AM
STILL MONITORING FOR THE POTENTIAL FOR A FREEZE AS WELL...AND DO
THINK THAT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS /AS WELL AS SOME SHELTERED AREAS
ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES/ COULD DIP AT/BELOW THE FREEZING MARK.
HOWEVER...DO NOT THINK IT WILL BE VERY WIDESPREAD OR ENOUGH TO
WARRANT A WATCH ATTM. BY SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WINDS WILL VEER TOWARD
THE SOUTHEAST...RESULTING IN A SLIGHT WARM UP INTO THE UPPER 60S TO
LOWER 70S EARLY THIS WEEK. ANOTHER UPPER-WAVE PASSAGE ON MONDAY
COULD BRING SOME LIGHT SHOWERS ALONG THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES AND
MOUNTAINS...BUT GIVEN THE HIGH VARIABILITY BETWEEN MODELS/RUNS AND
THE VERY WEAK QPF SIGNALS HAVE KEPT POPS BELOW MENTIONABLE LEVELS.
THE MAIN WEATHER FEATURE NEXT WEEK WILL BE ANOTHER COLD FRONT
MOVING INTO THE REGION LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY
EVENING...BRINGING A GOOD SHOT OF SHOWERS AND STORMS FOR THE MIDDLE
OF THE WEEK. THE GFS IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN ECMWF...BUT BOTH
MODELS INDICATE A BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION OCCURRING ON
WEDNESDAY...SO HAVE LIKELY POPS AREAWIDE THEN...BEFORE CLEARING
THINGS OUT FROM WEST TO EAST BY THURSDAY. THEREAFTER...RIDGING
BEGINS TO MOVE IN...WITH DRIER WEATHER EXPECTED FOR THE END OF NEXT
WEEK.

CAPPING INVERSION AROUND 700 MBS. IN FACT...AIRMASS OVER WRN TN AND

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH 
THE AREA LATE TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY...EXITING TO THE EAST EARLY FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON.  STRONG LOW LEVEL JET AHEAD OF THIS FRONT WILL BRING 
STRONG WINDS TO SOME OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TONIGHT...SO WILL KEEP 
WIND ADVISORY AS IS.  APPEARS INSTABILITY WILL BE ON THE WEAK

OVERALL NO MAJOR ARGUMENTS.  

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... COOLER AND DRIER
WEATHER WILL BEGIN TO TAKE HOLD THIS WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK
IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE ON FRIDAY. WITH A LINGERING
NORTHEASTERLY FLOW...HIGHS ON SATURDAY WILL LIKELY STRUGGLE TO
CLIMB MUCH ABOVE THE 60 DEGREE MARK IN MANY LOCATIONS... WHILE LOWS
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT WILL DIP BACK INTO THE MID 30S TO LOWER
40S. THUS...THE POTENTIAL FOR A FROST ADVISORY TO BE NEEDED FRIDAY

WINDS WILL EVENTUALLY VEER BACK TO THE SOUTH BY SUNDAY AND
MONDAY...ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO REBOUND INTO THE UPPER 60S TO
LOWER 70S WITH MOSTLY/PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS. ANOTHER UPPER-WAVE
PASSAGE LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY COULD TRIGGER SOME LOW-END
PRECIPITATION CHANCES ALONG AND EAST OF THE MOUNTAINS. THEN...
ANOTHER MUCH DEEPER UPPER-TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION ON
WEDNESDAY...BRINGING A GOOD SHOT SHOT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED STRONG COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE REGION LATER 
TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING. TODAY WILL BE A DRIER DAY THAN 
YESTERDAY WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE. STRENGTHENING PRESSURE GRADIENT 
WILL BOOST SOUTHERLY WINDS TO AROUND 10 TO 25 MPH WITH HIGHER GUSTS. 
APPLIED A WIND ADVISORY TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN TONIGHT AS 85H JET 
BUMPS UP TO AROUND 45 TO 50 KNOTS. LINE OF CONVECTION JUST AHEAD OF 
FRONT WILL MOVE ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU A FEW HOURS AFTER 
MIDNIGHT WITH THE LINE PROGRESSING TO NEAR A TYS AND CHA POSITION 
09-13Z AND ACROSS MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA BY MID 
DAY FRIDAY. QUITE A BIT OF SHEAR AVAILABLE WITH STORMS AS BULK SHEAR 
JUMPS UP TO AROUND 45-50 HOWEVER...BUOYANCY WILL BE VERY LIMITED 
WITH THE LINE BUILDING INTO THE REGION DURING THE EARLY MORNING 
HOURS. CERTAINLY IF ANY OF THE HIGHER VELOCITY FLOW CAN BE BROUGHT 
TO THE SURFACE...A FEW SEVERE GUSTS WILL BE POSSIBLE. BEST CHANCE 
FOR STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WOULD BE ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
CLOSER TO THE BETTER INSTABILITY. TWEAKED MAX TEMPS JUST A BIT 
HIGHER THAN THE WARMEST GUIDANCE TODAY AND STAYED NEAR THE MIDDLE OF 
GUIDANCE FOR MINS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...PRECIP WILL BE EAST OF 
THE AREA BY 00Z SAT...SO WILL CARRY NO POPS INTO FRIDAY NIGHT 
PERIOD. COLD ADVECTION AND CLEARING SKIES WILL DROP LOWS INTO THE 
30S IN MOST SPOTS SATURDAY MORNING...BUT REMAINING ABOVE FREEZING 
OUTSIDE THE HIGHEST MOUNTAINS PEAKS. SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WILL BE DRY 
AND SUNNY WITH SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL TEMPS AS HIGH PRESSURE MOVES 
OVER THE REGION.

THE MODELS GENERALLY AGREE ON A TROUGH TAKING SHAPE OVER THE PLAINS 
ON MONDAY...HOWEVER THE GFS AND ECMWF DIFFER ON PRECIP CHANCES FOR 
OUR AREA. THE ECMWF SHOW A SHORTWAVE TROUGH...WELL AHEAD OF THE 
DEEPENING LONGWAVE TROUGH...THAT BRINGS GULF MOISTURE ON 
MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT. THE GFS IS DRY THIS PERIOD...HOLDING OFF PRECIP 
UNTIL THE LONGWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES ON TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY. 
WITH THESE UNCERTAINTIES...WILL NOT MAKE MAJOR CHANGES TO THE

IN FOR TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

.AVIATION...A WARM FRONT WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. WEAK RIDGING ACROSS THE AREA. LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE ALONG THE E TN MNTS AND FROM CHA NORTHWARD UP THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COULD INITIATE CONVECTION BRIEFLY THIS EVENING. 
ONGOING CONVECTION ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT. STORM MOTIONS ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF THESE STORMS 
REACHING TRI OR TYS TONIGHT BUT CHANCES TOO LOW FOR TAF MENTION. A

.AVIATION...THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS HAS GREATLY DIMINISHED WITH 
WATCH NO LONGER IN EFFECT...ALTHO SOME STRONG CONVECTION DOES LINGER 
ALONG THE TN/GA LINE. THIS TSRA MAY AFFECT CHA FOR ANOTHER HOUR OR 
TWO. OTHERWISE...THE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND TSRA EARLIER TODAY WILL 
CREATE THE POTENTIAL FOR FOG AND POSSIBLY A LOW CEILING TO DEVELOP 
AT MAINLY CHA AND TRI OVERNIGHT. ONLY LIGHT RAIN FELL BRIEFLY AT TYS 
SO I DID NOT HIT THE FOG MUCH THERE JUST YET.

CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT LATE THURSDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...CONVECTION OVER THE AREA 
SHOULD BE GONE NORTHEAST ZONES BY TONIGHT AND DISSIPATE FAIRLY 
QUICKLY SOUTH. WILL CARRY CHANCE SOUTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE INTO 
CENTRAL AREAS FOR EARLY TONIGHT.  SUBSIDENCE AND MID LEVEL WARMING 
SHOULD CAP THINGS FOR THURSDAY KEEPING CONVECTION OUT OF AT LEAST 
MOST OF THE AREA.  CAP LOOKS WEAKEST FOR NORTH SO SOME CONCERN THAT 
WE COULD SEE SOME CONVECTION NORTH DURING THE AFTERNOON...BUT FOR 
NOW WILL KEEP FORECAST CONTINUITY AND KEEP POPS BELOW 15 WITH NO 
PRECIP MENTION.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO NO MAJOR 
ADJUSTMENTS. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...DEEP TROUGH MOVES 
FROM THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES AND MS VALLEY INTO THE OHIO AND 
TENNESSEE VALLEYS THURSDAY NIGHT WITH LINE OF STRONG TO SEVERE 
THUNDERSTORMS ADVANCING ACROSS TENNESSEE OVERNIGHT. WINDS WILL 
INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST OUT AHEAD OF THE LINE SO MAY 
NEED A WIND ADVISORY. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORM INTENSITY WILL LIKELY 
DECREASE LATE IN THE NIGHT AS IT APPROACHES THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. AS 
SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH FORECAST AREA MAY STILL SEE SOME DAMAGING WINDS 
WITH STRONG WINDS ALOFT BUT BEST INSTABILITY WILL SHIFT EAST OF THE 
MOUNTAINS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. IF THE LINE DIMINISHES BY EARLY 
FRIDAY IT MAY REINTENSIFY AS IT MOVES INTO THE MOUNTAINS BY EARLY 
AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD THURSDAY NIGHT AND NOT RISE 
MUCH FRIDAY WITH FRONT AND RAIN MOST OF THE DAY. A FEW SHOWERS 
LINGER EARLY FRIDAY EVENING THEN CLEARING WITH LOWS DROPPING INTO 
THE MID TO UPPER 30S IN THE NE AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY WILL SUNNY AND DRY AS COLD HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA 
FROM THE NORTHWEST. TEMPERATURES STAY BELOW NORMAL BUT BEGIN TO

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONVECTION WHICH FIRED ACROSS 
NORTHERN KENTUCKY TUESDAY EVENING IN ASSOCIATION WITH SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY TRAVERSING THE REGION HAS PROPAGATED SOUTHEAST INTO SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE EARLY THIS MORNING. A SIGNIFICANT 
PORTION OF THIS ACTION WILL HAVE PASSED SOUTH INTO CENTRAL EAST 
TENNESSEE BY 12Z THIS MORNING. APPLIED A CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS THE NORTH CLOSER TO THE STATIONARY FRONT IN 
POSITION JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AS WELL AS ANY OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARY FROM THE EARLY MORNING CONVECTION. MODELS NOT REVEALING ANY 
SIGNIFICANT SHEAR TODAY BUT DO SHOW SOME INSTABILITY DURING PEAK 
HEATING THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EARLY EVENING PERIOD. DOESN'T APPEAR 
TO BE ANY MAJOR FOCUS FOR CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON WITH FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY EDGING NORTH IN RESPONSE TO MAJOR UPPER TROUGH BUILDING 
EAST ACROSS THE ROCKIES. THEREFORE...FORECAST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION IN THE VALLEY WHILE USING LOW CHANCE PROBABILITIES FOR 
THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES. VERY LITTLE CHANCE FOR ANY CONVECTIVE 
PRECIP LATER IN THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT WITH ATMOSPHERE 
STABILIZING. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS TODAY AND TONIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...WITH A DEEP TROUGH CROSSING 
THE PLAINS ON THURSDAY...WE WILL SEE A TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT 
BRINGING BREEZY CONDITIONS TO THE AREA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE 
A STABLE ENVIRONMENT AND STRONG CAP THAT WILL KEEP US DRY UNTIL LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF 
BRINGING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE PLATEAU JUST BEFORE 12Z 
FRIDAY...MOVING THROUGH THE TN VALLEY FRIDAY MORNING AND EARLY 
AFTERNOON. GIVEN THE STRONG UNIDIRECTIONAL SHEAR...EXPECT THAT THE 
STORMS WILL TAKE THE FORM OF A SQUALL LINE WITH SOME EMBEDDED BOW 
SEGMENTS...SOME OF WHICH MAY BRING THE 60 KTS WINDS AT 850 MB DOWN 
TO THE SURFACE IN SOME AREAS. THE LACK OF INSTABILITY WILL BE A 
LIMITING FACTOR FOR SEVERE STORMS. PRECIP WILL BE DECREASING THROUGH 
THE AFTERNOON WITH THE ADVECTION OF A COLDER AND DRIER AIR MASS 
FRIDAY NIGHT. LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE 30S IN SOME LOCATIONS ACROSS 
THE NORTH AND THE MOUNTAINS BOTH FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY NIGHT. 

THE WEEKEND WILL BE DRY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM 
THE WEST. TEMPERATURES WILL BE A BIT BELOW NORMAL. A SOUTHERLY FLOW 
BRINGS TEMPS BACK TO NORMAL BY MONDAY AS THE HIGH MOVES OFFSHORE. A 
GRADUAL INCREASE IN BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE IN THE SOUTHERLY FLOW 
REGIME MAY BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR TUESDAY.

SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS GOING INTO THE EVENING HOURS.  THE STRONGEST 
STORMS SHOULD REMAIN CONFINED TO THE SOUTH AND WEST WITH A SLIGHT 
RISK OF SEVERE OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.  OVERNIGHT...A WEAK 
SHORT WAVE RIDING THROUGH OUR FAR SOUTH THEN EASTERN AREAS WILL 
PROVIDE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF CONVECTION INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.  ON

A BETTER CHANCE OF MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION ACROSS THE AREA.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR SRN AND ERN AREAS WEDNESDAY EVENING...BUT KEPT THURSDAY DRY 
FOR NOW AS AIRMASS IS A LITTLE DRIER AND MUCH LESS UNSTABLE THAN 
WEDNESDAY. MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT AND CONSISTENT FROM 
EARLIER MODEL RUNS ON TIMING THE NEXT COLD FRONT FOR FRIDAY MORNING. 
SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS ARE NOT VERY NOTABLE FOR FRIDAY...DUE IN 
LARGE PART TO THE EARLY PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT. PREVIOUS POP AND 
WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED RIGHT ON TRACK FOR NOW. THE CONVECTION COULD 
END PRIOR TO FRIDAY EVENING...AND LIKELY AS EARLY AS THE AFTERNOON 
FOR WRN MOST AREAS.

A PLEASANT WEEKEND WITH A ZONAL TO SW FLOW ALOFT...WHILE A LARGE 
SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE COVERS THE ERN THIRD OF THE NATION. 
NOT SEEING MUCH SUPPORT FOR ANY RAIN CHANCES ON MONDAY...SO OPTED TO 
DROP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OUT OF THE FORECAST GRIDS. ANOTHER COLD

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A MORE SUMMER-LIKE PATTERN SETS UP OVER THE REGION FOR THE NEXT FEW 
DAYS AS HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST BRINGS A S-SW FLOW TO 
THE TN VALLEY. TODAY...THE MODELS BRING AN AREA OF ENHANCED 850 MB 
THETA-E UP FROM THE DEEP SOUTH...ALONG WITH WEAK LOW LEVEL 
CONVERGENCE AND A 500 MB VORT MAX. THIS SHOULD BRING SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY...WITH DIMINISHING 
COVERAGE NORTH AND EAST WHERE THE CAP WILL BE STRONGER CLOSER TO THE 
RIDGE. LI AND MLCAPE VALUES SUGGEST SOME LOW POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE 
STORMS IN THE PLATEAU THIS AFTERNOON...WITH WINDS BEING THE MAIN 
THREAT ALONG WITH SOME MARGINALLY SEVERE HAIL. THE WARMING TREND 
CONTINUES...WITH MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS IN THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S.

SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION IS EXPECTED AGAIN ON 
WEDNESDAY...ALTHOUGH WITH LESS INSTABILITY AND LESS DYNAMIC FORCING 
IN SUPPORT AS THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE BUILDS SLIGHTLY OVERHEAD. HIGHS 
WILL REACH THE LOWER 80S IN MOST SPOTS. THURSDAY LOOKS DRY AS THE 
CAPPING INVERSION STRENGTHENS AND PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES DROP. 
TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE TO BE ABOVE NORMAL...WITH LOWS IN THE 
UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S AND HIGHS IN THE 80S.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF LATE WORK WEEK SYSTEM AS
ANOTHER DEEP UPPER LEVEL TROUGH ADVANCES INTO THE EASTERN U.S. LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WITH A HEALTHY COLD FRONT PRESSING INTO
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY
FRIDAY. TWEAKED POPS UP TO CATEGORICAL FOR THE EVENT WHICH LOOKS
LIKE IT WILL ARRIVE IN THE FORM OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.
TIMING STILL A BIT UNCERTAIN THIS MANY DAYS OUT SO BROAD BRUSHED
HIGH POPS FROM LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO THE AFTERNOON ON FRIDAY.
MAINTAINED SOME SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE POPS LATE DAY AND EARLY
EVENING AS MODELS HINT AT SOME TRAILING SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND
MOISTURE BEHIND THE MAIN FRONTAL PUSH. KEPT A DRY AND COOLER
WEEKEND IN PLACE AS A COOL SURFACE RIDGE TAKES UP RESIDENCE ACROSS
THE EASTERN U.S. FORECAST CONFIDENCE LOWER DURING THE FINAL DAY OF
THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH SOME TIMING AND STRENGTH ISSUES WITH
ARRIVAL OF NEXT STORM SYSTEM SO JUST MAINTAINED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
FOR POSSIBILITY OF SHOWERS ON MONDAY.

REGARDLESS...MODEL SOUNDING INDICATE THAT THE BOUNDARY LAYER WILL
MOISTEN BY 09-10Z OR LATE TONIGHT...RESULTING IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...WEAK RIDGING OVER THE AREA 
TONIGHT FOR CONTINUED CALM AND BENIGN WEATHER.  LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA ON TUESDAY AND A WEAK 
BOUNDARY SHOULD DEVELOP GENERALLY TO OUR NORTH AND WEST MAY ALLOW 
FOR ISOLATED DIURNAL CONVECTION DURING THE AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...DIURNAL CONVECTION 
EXPECTED FOR THE EARLIER PERIODS WITH HIGHER POPS (CHANCE) JUSTIFIED 
FOR WEDNESDAY WHEN GREATEST INSTABILITY WAS NOTED. FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
OVER OHIO VALLEY IS SHOWN TO LIFT NORTH BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SO KEPT 
JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON. MODELS SEEM TO BE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT ON THE NEXT SIGNIFICANT COLD FRONT TO APPROACH BY 
12Z FRIDAY...SUPPORTING HIGH POPS FOR FRIDAY DAYTIME. NUDGED POPS UP 
TO UPPER BOUNDS OF LIKELY AND CATEGORICAL POPS MAY BE NEEDED.

PRECIPITATION ENDS BY 06Z SATURDAY WITH ANOTHER DRY AND PLEASANT 
WEEKEND IN STORE FOR THE REGION. TEMPS WILL BE SLIGHTLY BELOW 
SEASONAL NORMALS SATURDAY THEN QUITE CLOSE TO NORMAL FOR SUNDAY.
WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW RETURNS BY MONDAY...WITH GFS DRY WHILE 
ECMWF DEVELOPS DIURNAL CONVECTION AGAIN. I OPTED TO JUST CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AFTERNOON AND MONDAY NIGHT. GFSX MOS 
POPS WERE TRENDING LOWER ON 15/12Z RUN FROM 15/00Z GUIDANCE...SO
WILL WAIT AND SEE WHAT THE TREND IS FROM LATER RUNS. CLOSELY 
FOLLOWED THE LATEST GFSX MOS TEMPS FOR ALL PERIODS. 

STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE STORMS POSSIBLE FOR LATE TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS MAINLY OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES...WHILE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
PRECIP IN SW VA WILL BE OUT OF THE AREA BY 12Z. WHILE SOME POCKETS 
OF DRIZZLE MAY LINGER...NO POPS WILL BE CARRIED IN THE FORECAST 
AFTER THIS TIME DUE TO DECREASING MOISTURE DEPTH AND LACK OF LIFT. A 
THIN SATURATED LAYER FROM 950-900 MB REMAINS IN PLACE THROUGH MOST 
OF THE MORNING...GRADUALLY SCATTERING OUT BY NOON. TEMPERATURES 
TODAY WILL BE VERY TRICKY DUE TO UNCERTAINTIES WITH CLOUD 
COVER...BUT GENERALLY LEANED ON THE COOL SIDE OF MOS FOR HIGHS. 

FOR TONIGHT...A SURFACE RIDGE WILL EXTEND SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE
CAROLINAS...WITH A SE FETCH OF MOISTURE BRINGING SOME CLOUDS AROUND
THE END OF THE APPALACHIANS INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE TN VALLEY
LATE. LOW TEMPS WILL BE FAIRLY MILD AS A RESULT...IN THE UPPER 50S
SOUTH...WITH LOWER 50S NORTH UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
SURFACE RIDGING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL KEEP WINDS ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA EAST TO SOUTHEAST TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.
SOUTHERLY WINDS OUT FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO WILL PULL MOISTURE INTO
THE WESTERN AND MIDDLE TENNESSEE VALLEY. MODELS SHOW A CONVERGENCE
BOUNDARY ACROSS THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR TUESDAY AND
WEDNESDAY WHICH WILL ACT AS A FOCUS FOR MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION.
ALSO...CONVECTION ALONG AND TERRAIN FEATURES IS ALSO ANTICIPATED.

FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...A STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST INTO 
THE PLAINS STATES WITH STRONG CYCLOGENESIS MOVING TOWARD THE GREAT 
LAKES. THE ASSOCIATED TRAILING COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA FRIDAY PRODUCING WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A 
THUNDERSTORM. MODELS SHOW INSTABILITY QUITE LIMITED ALONG AND AHEAD 
OF THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. ANOTHER FACTOR THAT WILL LIMIT STRENGTH OF 
CONVECTION IS TIMING OF FRONTAL PASSAGE..WHICH CURRENTLY LOOKS LIKE 
FROPA IN THE MORNING.

AN UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES MONDAY WILL MOVE
NORTHEAST ACROSS SOUTHEAST CANADA. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL
MOVE SOUTH INTO THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY...BUT THE WEST TO SOUTHWEST
FLOW ALOFT WILL KEEP THE BOUNDARY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.

BY MID-WEEK...GULF MOISTURE WILL INCREASE OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY PRODUCING DIURNAL CONVECTION FOR WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. GREATEST COVERAGE WILL BE OVER THE LOCAL 
TERRAIN. FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK...A STRONG UPPER TROUGH

SUNRISE. THIS UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE IS PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA LATE SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT...PRODUCING SCATTERED 
SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE NAM AND GFS MODELS REVEAL SOME 
LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH HOW MUCH SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL BE GENERATED 
WITH THIS SHORT WAVE OVER THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH THE 
NAM MODEL MORE AGGRESSIVE THAN THE GFS MODEL. FOR NOW...WILL TREND 
TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO SOLUTIONS...WHICH SEEMS TO BE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ECMWF MODEL. OVERALL...MOST OF THE SHOWER 
ACTIVITY WITH THIS SHORT WAVE SHOULD OCCUR FARTHER EAST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA OVER THE CAROLINAS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY...BUT THEN 
REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR MONDAY NIGHT WHEN A COMPROMISE BETWEEN 
THE TWO SEEMS PRUDENT.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK UPPER RIDGE IN PLACE 
WITH A LOW LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN WILL PROVIDE DIURNAL CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE AREA TUESDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCE OVER HIGHER TERRAIN. 
THE PATTERN CONTINUES INTO WEDNESDAY AND WITH INCREASING MOISTURE 
AND A WEAK IMPULSE MOVING THROUGH...WILL PROVIDE BETTER CONVERGE OF 
CONVECTION. MODEL CONSISTENCE HAS BEEN POOR WITH TIMING OF AN 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT FOR THE MIDDLE PART OF THE EXTENDED. CURRENT 
TREND HAS BEEN SLOWER AND HAVE SLIGHTLY LOWERED POPS ON THURSDAY 
WITH BEST CHANCES OF THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. THE FRONT SHOULD 
EXIT THE AREA WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN FOR SATURDAY. 
AS FOR TEMPERATURES...GUIDANCE LOOKS REASONABLE AND STAY CLOSE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE BUILDING INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST 
TODAY. WITH A DRY WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT...WE WILL SEE MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES TODAY. HIGH TEMPS UNDER FULL SUN AND NEUTRAL ADVECTION WILL 
RISE A FEW DEGRESS FROM YESTERDAY...FROM LOWER 70S SOUTH TO MID 60S 
NORTH. WITH CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS...LOWS TONIGHT WILL DROP INTO 
THE 40S IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A FAIRLY FLAT ZONAL FLOW WILL 
START THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH A WEAK SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE CLIPPING 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND EARLY MONDAY WITH A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS. A STRONGER NORTHERN STREAM UPPE TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS/NORTHERN GREAT LAKES WITH ASSOCIATED TRAILING COLD 
FRONT MOVING INTO THE OHIO VALLEY FOR LATE MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

MODELS SHOW A GOOD DEAL OF GULF MOISTURE MOVING NORTH INTO THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR TUESDAY...THEN 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THIS 
INCREASING MOISTURE WILL INCREASE CHANCES OF DIURNAL CONVECTION WITH 
GREATER COVERGE OVER THE TERRAIN FEATURES FOR WEDNESDAY.

FOR WEDENSDAY AND THURSDAY...A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE OUT 
OF THE GREAT BASIN INTO THE PLAIN STATES. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL 
PRODUCE A SERIES CYCLOGENESIS OVER TX/OK WHICH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST 
INTO THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY/LOWER GREAT LAKES REGION FOR THURSDAY AND 
THURSDAY NIGHT. THE TRAILING COLD FRONT WILL SWEEP ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY MORNING. STRONG/SEVERE

.DISCUSSION...
VERY MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING AS MOST
EVERYTHING APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. A SURFACE HIGH WILL CONTINUE TO
BUILD INTO THE REGION OVERNIGHT...PROMOTING MOSTLY CLEAR AND DRY
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL RESULT IN COOLER
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT AS SOME DECENT RADIATIONAL COOLING WILL TAKE
PLACE THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...SOME LIGHT WESTERLY WINDS ARE PROGGED
TO REMAIN IN PLACE OVERNIGHT WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR SOME MIXING...AND
THIS COMBINED WITH DEWPOINTS GENERALLY HANGING IN MID 30 TO LOWER
40S WILL PREVENT TEMPS FROM COMPLETELY CATERING OVERNIGHT. AS A
RESULT...THINK THAT LOWS IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL REMAIN IN
THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S...GENERALLY PREVENTING ANY WIDESPREAD
FROST. THUS...WILL HOLD OFF ON A FROST ADVISORY. HOWEVER...SOME
SHELTERED LOCATIONS ALONG THE FOOTHILLS...MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU MAY
DIP INTO THE LOW TO MID 30S...SO HAVE ADDED A MENTION OF PATCHY
FROST TO THE ZONES LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY MORNING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TOMORROW)...WITH THE COLD FRONT OFF TO OUR 
EAST...DRIER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO FILTER IN OVERNIGHT. THE DRIER AIR 
IS HAVING A HARDER TIME WORKING ITS WAY IN ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS MOISTURE HAS POOLED UP AGAINST THE MOUNTAINS 
AND IS TRAPPED UNDER A MID-LEVEL INVERSION. CURRENT THINKING IS THAT 
FROM KNOXVILLE NORTH WILL HANG ON TO A FEW CLOUDS OVERNIGHT WITH THE 
NORTHERN AREAS HAVING AN EVEN BETTER CHANCE. HIGHER DEWPOINTS 
COMBINED WITH THIS CLOUD COVER SHOULD PREVENT FROST ACROSS NORTHEAST 
TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE LOWER 40S IN MOST 
SPOTS...WITH SOME 30S NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS. LOWS WILL BE 
AROUND 5 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL FROM KNOXVILLE SOUTH WITH NORTHEAST TN 
BEING CLOSE TO CLIMO. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN TO BUILD IN 
OVERNIGHT AND CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY WHILE THE MEAN FLOW WILL STAY 
MOSTLY ZONAL. CLOUDS MAY LINGER ACROSS THE NORTHERN AREAS TOMORROW 
MORNING BUT EVERYONE SHOULD BE MOSTLY SUNNY BY LATE MORNING/EARLY 
AFTERNOON. OVERALL...SATURDAY SHOULD BE A VERY PLEASANT DAY WITH 
HIGHS EXPECTED TO BE NEAR CLIMATOLOGY. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
SHIFTING EAST AND OUT OF THE AREA ON SATURDAY NIGHT...EARLY SUNDAY 
WILL ALLOW AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TO SLIDE NORTHEASTWARD FROM 
THE GULF OF MEXICO LATE SUNDAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT.  MODELS SHOWING 
DIFFERENCES IN THE TRACK OF THE LOW PRESSURE...VARYING FROM BRINGING 
IT ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS TO THROUGH THE CAROLINAS.  WILL 
COMPROMISE FOR NOW WITH LOW POPS FAR SOUTH LATE SUNDAY AND LOW POPS 
NORTHWEST TO CHANCE POPS SOUTH AND EAST FOR SUNDAY NIGHT.  WILL 
LINGER LOW POPS ACROSS THE AREA ON MONDAY.  A COUPLE OF WEAK 
IMPULSES MOVING THROUGH COMBINED WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME DIURNAL 
CONVECTION WILL KEEP 20 TO 30 POPS IN PLACE TUESDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY.  A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
TO THURSDAY.  MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW DIFFERENCES IN TIMING BUT THE 
FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL PROVIDE OUR BEST CHANCE OF CONVECTION DURING 
THE EXTENDED.  THIS SYSTEM SHOULD BE MOVING OUT FOR A DRY FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SURFACE COLD FRONT IS MOVING INTO THE AREA AT THE MOMENT...WITH A 
LINE OF SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORMS ALONG THE FRONT. THIS LINE 
OF SHOWERS IS PROJECTED TO EXIT THE AREA BEFORE 12Z. THE 850 MB 
FRONT LAGS BEHIND A BIT...AND WILL HOLD A CHANCE POP NORTHEAST UNTIL 
THE 850 MB FRONT EXITS AROUND 15Z. AFTER THIS TIME WE WILL SEE RAPID 
CLEARING...WITH FULL SUN EXPECTED THE REMAINDER OF THE DAY. THIS 
WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO REACH INTO THE 60S UNDER COLD ADVECTION. WITH 
CLEAR SKIES CONTINUING OVERNIGHT AND WINDS BECOMING LIGHT...LOWS 
WILL DROP INTO THE 40S IN MOST SPOTS...WITH SOME 30S NORTH AND IN 
THE MOUNTAINS. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A FAST SOUTHERN STREAM ZONAL FLOW THROUGH MONDAY. A SHORT-WAVE
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES LATE SUNDAY THORUGH MONDAY
MORNING. GFS/ECMWF SHOW THAT THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS OF
THE FORECAST AREA COULD SEE SOME LIGHT SHOWERS FROM THIS SYSTEM.

A STRONG NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES/NORTHERN PLAINS PULLING A COLD FRONT INTO THE SOUTHERN OHIO 
VALLEY FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. A GOOD DEAL OF GULF MOISTURE WILL 
PULL INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR MID-WEEK WITH CHANCES OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS.

FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK...A MUCH STRONGER UPPER TROUGH WILL 
MOVE THE GREAT BASIN INTO THE PLAINS STATES WITH AN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE MOVING SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. TRAILING COLD 
FRONT WILL SWEEP THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY/THURSDAY 
NIGHT. ANOTHER ROUND OF STRONG-SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS ARE AGAIN 
PROBABLE. WILL NEED TO MONITOR THIS POTENTIAL NEXT WEEK.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
315 PM EDT THU APR 11 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF 
THE FORECAST WILL BE THE THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER THIS EVENING 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE COLD FRONT IS CURRENTLY LOCATED BACK 
ACROSS WEST TN. MODELS HAVE CONTINUED TO TREND SLOWER WITH THE 
TIMING OF THE FRONT AND ITS ASSOCIATED SQUALL LINE. SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE CURRENTLY ONGOING ACROSS MIDDLE TN. THESE STORMS 
ARE EXPECTED TO STRENGTHEN LATER THIS AFTERNOON...AS FRONTOGENETIC 
FORCING RAMPS UP DURING THE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING HOURS. THE MAIN 
LINE OF CONVECTION WILL PROBABLY ARRIVE ON THE PLATEAU BETWEEN 21Z 
TO 00Z...ACROSS THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND SOUTHWEST NC BETWEEN 00Z AND 
03Z...AND ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA BETWEEN 03Z AND 05Z. 
HOWEVER...SCATTERED STORMS COULD DEVELOP OUT AHEAD OF THIS MAIN 
LINE...ESPECIALLY AS WE BECOME INCREASINGLY MORE UNSTABLE LATER THIS 
AFTERNOON. SOUNDINGS INDICATE CAPE VALUES APPROACHING 600 TO 1200 
J/KG BY LATE AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING. THE INSTABILITY...COMBINED 
WITH STRONG UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS...WILL ALLOW FOR STRONG TO SEVERE 
STORMS TO DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MEAN FLOW IS NEARLY 
PARALLEL TO THE FRONT...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW STORM MODE TO STAY MAINLY 
LINEAR. EVEN THOUGH THERE IS A LACK OF DIRECTIONAL SHEAR...SPEED 
SHEAR COULD ALLOW FOR AN ISOLATED EMBEDDED SUPERCELL WITHIN THE 
LINE. THE MAIN THREATS EXPECTED WITH THESE STORMS WILL BE DAMAGING 
WINDS AND HAIL UP TO ONE INCH...THOUGH A BRIEF ISOLATED TORNADO 
CANNOT BE RULED OUT AS WELL. IT IS WORTH MENTIONING THAT THE 
SOUTHERN VALLEY HAS A SLIGHTLY HIGHER RISK FOR AN ISOLATED TORNADO 
AS PARAMETERS ARE A LITTLE MORE FAVORABLE. SPC CURRENTLY HAS THE 
MAJORITY OF THE CWA UNDER A 2% TOR RISK WHILE THE EXTREME SOUTHERN 
AREAS ARE UNDER A 5% RISK.

IN ADDITION TO THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT...HEAVY RAINFALL COULD POSE 
A PROBLEM AS WELL. GIVEN THE SLOW MOVING NATURE OF THE FRONT... 
COMBINED WITH HIGH PWATS ACROSS THE REGION...THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY 
RAINFALL/TRAINING IS POSSIBLE. SOUNDINGS INDICATE PWAT VALUES 
RANGING FROM 1.61 SOUTH TO 1.3 NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ARE 
POSSIBLE BY THIS EVENING. BASED ON CLIMATOLOGY...THESE VALUES ARE 
NEAR/ABOVE THE 99TH PERCENTILE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. THIS MEANS 
THERE IS THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINFALL AND LOCALIZED FLOODING 
ACROSS THE REGION.

AFTER 06Z TO 09Z...THE HEAVIEST ACTIVITY WILL BEGIN TO PUSH EAST 
ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS INTO NORTH CAROLINA...WITH MOST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA DRYING OUT BY DAYBREAK ON FRIDAY MORNING. TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
CLOSE TO NORMAL ON FRIDAY.

353 AM EDT THU APR 11 2013

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
THE PRIMARY FOCUS OF THE FORECAST WILL BE THE THREAT FOR A SEVERE
WEATHER OUTBREAK LATER THIS AFTERNOON/EVENING ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA. EARLY THIS MORNING...A COLD FRONT AND ITS ASSOCIATED LINE OF
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IS LOCATED ROUGHLY ALONG THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...MID/HIGH CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO
OVERSPREAD THE FORECAST AREA AS SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS TRANSPORT GULF
MOISTURE INTO THE REGION AND ALSO HELP TO PUSH HIGHS BACK INTO THE
UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S BY THE AFTERNOON. THIS FRONT AND LINE OF
STORMS WILL CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY TRACK EASTWARD INTO MIDDLE AND
EVENTUALLY EAST TENNESSEE AND THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY
THE LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODELS HAVE CONTINUED TO TREND
SLOWER WITH THE TIMING OF THE FRONT AND THE ASSOCIATED SQUALL LINE
TO THIS TIME PERIOD WHICH WILL ALLOW SOME HEATING/DESTABILIZATION
DURING THE DAYTIME HOURS AND SOME APPRECIABLE INSTABILITY VALUES
WITH MUCAPE VALUES AOA 750-1500 J/KG AROUND 00Z. THIS INSTABILITY
COMBINED WITH THE STRONG JET DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS UPPER-
LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL RESULT IN THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS /LIKELY IN THE FORM OF A LINE/...WITH DAMAGING WINDS
AND HAIL BEING THE PRIMARY THREATS...THOUGH A BRIEF ISOLATED
TORNADO CANNOT BE RULED OUT AS WELL.

IN ADDITION TO THE SEVERE WEATHER THREAT...GIVEN THE SLOW MOVING
NATURE OF THE FRONT...THE HIGH PWATS VALUES ACROSS THE REGION AND
THE MAIN FLOW MOVING PARALLEL TO THIS FRONT...THE POTENTIAL FOR
HEAVY RAINFALL/TRAINING SEEMS PRETTY LIKELY WITH THE SHOWERS AND
STORMS THAT DO MOVE THROUGH. THUS...THE POTENTIAL FOR LOCALIZED
FLOODING WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE REGION AS WELL LATER THIS
EVENING AND WILL HIGHLIGHT THIS IN THE HWO. AFTER 06Z...THE
HEAVIEST ACTIVITY WILL BEGIN TO PUSH EAST ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS INTO
NORTH CAROLINA...WITH MOST OF THE AREA DRYING OUT BY DAYBREAK ON
FRIDAY MORNING. 

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
SHOWERS SHOULD EXIT THE EASTERN MOST AREAS FRIDAY MORNING...FOLLOWED
BY DECREASING CLOUDS. PREVIOUS GRIDS STILL ON TRACK WITH JUST MINOR
TWEAKS TO MAX TEMPS.

DRY WEATHER AND A GRADUAL WARMING TREND RETURN FOR THE WEEKEND AS 
SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE RETURN. MODELS START TO DIVERGE A BIT FOR 
EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH JUST LOW POPS JUSTIFIED FOR NOW FOR POSSIBLE 
DIURNAL CONVECTION ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. MOISTURE RETURN IS BETTER 
BY TUESDAY...BUT BEST RAIN CHANCES WOULD APPEAR TO HOLD OFF UNTIL 
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ACCEPTING THE NEXT FRONTAL PASSAGE 
LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT..SO POPS WERE INCREASED TO GOOD CHANCE AT THAT 
TIME.

OTHERWISE...GFSX MOS GUIDANCE HAS BEEN CONSISTENT FOR PAST FEW RUNS 
AND THE MAX/MIN TEMPS CLOSELY FOLLOW THE 11/00Z GFSX MOS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
ANOTHER WARM NIGHT IS IN STORE AS OVERNIGHT LOWS WILL ONLY DROP DOWN 
INTO THE MID 50S NORTH TO NEAR 60 SOUTH...WHICH WILL RESULT IN LOWS 
THAT ARE 10 TO 15 DEGREES ABOVE AVERAGE FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. 

THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL CONTINUE TO STEEPEN OVERNIGHT IN ADVANCE OF AN 
APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. THE GRADIENT FURTHER 
STEEPENS TOMORROW WHICH WILL RESULT IN SOME BREEZY TO GUSTY 
SOUTHWEST WINDS DEVELOPING AFTER SUNRISE.  

SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TOMORROW AS A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES THE AREA. SOME OF THESE STORMS COULD BE SEVERE AS THERE 
WILL BE ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND SHEAR TO PROMOTE STRONG STORMS. IT IS 
POSSIBLE THAT A FEW STORMS COULD DEVELOP OUT AHEAD OF THE MAIN 
LINE...BUT NOT OVERLY CONFIDENT BECAUSE OF A LACK OF FOCUSING 
MECHANISM FOR DEVELOPMENT. NAM SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT ANY CAPPING 
SHOULD BE GONE BY AROUND 15Z TO 18Z...WITH TRI POSSIBLY NOT CAP FREE 
TILL AROUND 20Z. MODELS CONTINUE TO AGREE THAT THE ARRIVAL OF THE 
MAIN LINE OF CONVECTION WILL PROBABLY ARRIVE BY AROUND 20Z ON THE 
PLATEAU AND 00Z FOR THE EAST TN VALLEY AND OTHER LOCATIONS. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE A UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND PROFILE WITH STRONG SHEAR 
TO ENHANCE UPDRAFTS. SOUNDINGS SHOW ANYWHERE FROM 800 TO 1000 J/KG 
CAPE FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS. FREEZING AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS ARE 
MARGINAL FOR LARGE HAIL...SO MAIN THREAT LOOKS TO BE DAMAGING WINDS 
AND ISOLATED TORNADO THREAT. PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS WERE 
FOLLOWED CLOSELY. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AS IS TYPICALLY THE CASE 
MODEL FORECASTS ARE ON THE SAME PAGE FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD BUT DIVERGENT SCENARIOS EMERGE LATE. FRIDAY...THE 
BACK EDGE OF THE PRECIPITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THE NEGATIVE TILT 
SHORT WAVE MOVES OUT DURING THE MORNING LEAVING THE ENTIRE FORECAST 
AREA WITH A DRY AFTERNOON. DRY ADVECTION AND THEN RISING HEIGHTS 
ALLOW FOR A CONTINUATION OF DRY WEATHER THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD 
SUNDAY. SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY TIME FRAME...MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN 
AGREEMENT BUT GENERALLY POINT TOWARD A SHORT WAVELENGTH FEATURE 
BUILDING ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WITH AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE 
AND INSTABILITY LEADING TO THE POSSIBILITY OF A PERIOD OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS. BROADBRUSHED SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THIS CHANCE OF RAIN. TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY MODEL 
FORECASTS CONTINUE TO SHOW GRADUALLY INCREASING MOISTURE ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WITH A STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW AND SUFFICIENT 
INSTABILITY FOR A PERIOD OR TWO OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. THE 
GFS TRIES TO BRING A FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION TOWARD THE END OF THE LONG TERM RESULTING IN INCREASING 
MOISTURE CONVERGENCE/LIFT WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. THE ECMWF AND CMC 
BECOME MORE AMPLIFIED WITH AN UPPER RIDGE MAKING SLOWER PROGRESS 
ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. DECIDED TO ADJUST POP UP TO LOW CHANCE 
CATEGORY FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AT THE END OF THE PERIOD. 
WILL HAVE TO WAIT ON FUTURE MODEL FORECAST GUIDANCE TO DEAL WITH 
CORRECT FRONTAL TIMING DURING THIS PART OF THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
AN UPPER-RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE EASTWARD OFF THE SOUTH
CAROLINA COAST...BUT IT'S BROAD INFLUENCE WILL CONTINUE TO PROMOTE
MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND DRY WEATHER TODAY...ALONG WITH
CONTINUED WARMTH. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL BE SHARPENED ACROSS
THE REGION TODAY AS AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS
ACROSS THE MISSOURI VALLEY. THIS WILL RESULT IN SOME BREEZY TO
GUSTY SOUTHWEST WINDS...WHICH WILL AID THE SOLAR HEATING IN PUSHING
HIGHS INTO THE LOW TO MID 80S IN MANY AREAS BY THE AFTERNOON. BY
THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT...MID TO HIGH CLOUDS WILL BEGIN FILTER
INTO THE AREA AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT THAT WILL BE SLOWLY MOVING
THROUGH THE MID-SOUTH. THE LATEST MODEL PROJECTIONS CONTINUE TO
TREND DRIER OVERNIGHT AND DO NOT SHOW ANY CONVECTION MOVING IN
UNTIL WELL AFTER SUNRISE THURSDAY. THUS...HAVE REMOVED MENTIONABLE
POPS FROM THE FORECAST OVERNIGHT.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
MAIN PERIODS OF CONCERN WILL BE THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT AS
CONVECTION DEVELOPS AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT. MODELS
HAVE ALL GENERALLY SLOWED DOWN THE ONSET OF TSRA UNTIL PROBABLY MID
TO LATE MORNING ON THE PLATEAU AND AFTERNOON/EVENING OVER REMAINDER
OF E TN/SW VA/SW NC. AIRMASS WILL LIKELY HAVE TO RECOVER FROM
DECAYING MCS ACTIVITY LEFTOVER FROM LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. FORECAST
SOUNDINGS INDICATE A UNIDIRECTIONAL WIND PROFILE WITH STRONG SHEAR
TO ENHANCE UPDRAFTS. FREEZING AND WET BULB ZERO HEIGHTS ARE
MARGINAL FOR LARGE HAIL...SO MAIN THREAT LOOKS TO BE DAMAGING WINDS
AND ISOLATED TORNADO THREAT. PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS WERE
FOLLOWED CLOSELY.

SHOWERS END EARLY FRIDAY WITH RATHER LARGE DIFFERENCES FROM MOS 
GUIDANCE ON HIGHS FOR FRIDAY. BASED ON EXPECTED 850 MB TEMPS AND 
CLEARING...I OPTED FOR A FEW DEGREES BELOW THE GFS MAXES AND NOT AS 
COOL AS THE NAM MAXES.

KEEPING THE WEEKEND DRY FOR NOW AS PATTERN SUPPORTS THE UPPER RIDGE 
TO BUILD...WHILE SURFACE RIDGE AXIS HOLDS ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES 
THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. SOME WEAK SOUTHERLY FLOW BY MONDAY WITH A WARM 
FRONT MOVING NE FROM THE MID MS VALLEY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. 
PREFERRED TO NOT GO ANY HIGHER THAN SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW ON

TARGETS OF OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OVER THE GFS MOS. 

10/00Z GFS MOS POPS HAVE INCREASED FOR TUESDAY WITH SOME INDICATION

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...STILL HAVE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES 
AND MILD TEMPERATURES ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING. UPPER RIDGE 
BUILDING BACK TODAY AS THE UPPER LOW DEEPENS OVER THE SW STATES. 
WEAKER SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW TODAY AND LESS LOW LEVEL RH...SO
EXPECTING JUST SOME PASSING HIGH CLOUDS AND A FEW TO SCATTERED 
CUMULUS CLOUDS. PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID LOOKED VERY GOOD WITH HIGHS 
IN THE 70S TO LOWER 80S...WARM BUT NOT CLOSE ENOUGH TO RECORD HIGHS 
(CHA 89 - TYS 86 - TRI 83). 

CUMULUS CLOUDS DISSIPATE THIS EVENING LEAVING POSSIBLY SOME HIGH 
CLOUDS OVERNIGHT. WINDS DIMINISH AS WELL...SO MINOR TWEAK TO LOWER 
MIN TEMPS FOR TONIGHT...BUT NOT TOO FAR FROM GFS MOS OVERALL. 


.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OFF THE CAROLINA COAST WILL CONTINUE TO
PROMOTE PARTLY SUNNY AND DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY...ALONG WITH A
STOUT SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF AN AN APPROACHING STORM SYSTEM
FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO POTENTIALLY REACH THE
WARMEST LEVELS OF SPRING SO FAR...WITH THE MERCURY CLIMBING INTO
THE LOW TO MID 80S IN MANY AREAS. HOWEVER...AN UPPER LOW SWINGING
FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES WILL DRAG A COLD
FRONT THROUGH THE AREA THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL
TRIGGER OFF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS...SOME WHICH COULD BECOME
STRONG TO SEVERE. THE DYNAMICS/WIND SHEAR ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
STORM SYSTEM ARE CERTAINLY MOST IMPRESSIVE. INSTABILITY WILL BE MUCH
MORE OF A QUESTION THOUGH...GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY IN THE TIMING OF
THE FRONT. BY 12Z THURSDAY...A SQUALL LINE MAY BE ONGOING ALONG THE
FRONT IN WEST/MIDDLE TN AND WILL GRADUALLY PUSH ITS WAY TOWARD THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THE DAY. THOUGH HEATING MAY BE
HINDERED SOMEWHAT GIVEN THE DENSE CLOUD COVER AND PREFRONTAL SHOWER
ACTIVITY...THIS STORM SYSTEM WILL CERTAINLY ALLOW FOR A DAMAGING
WIND THREAT AS WELL AS SOME SEVERE HAIL AS WELL. THIS...COMBINED
WITH THE STRONG JET ENERGY AND WIND SHEAR WILL CREATE AN ELEVATED
POTENTIAL FOR A SEVERE WEATHER OUTBREAK ON THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT.
THUS...WILL CONTINUE TO LEAVE A MENTION OF THIS IN THE HWO AND
MONITOR THE LATEST OBS/TRENDS.

THEREAFTER...SOME COOLER BUT PARTLY SUNNY AND DRY WEATHER WILL
ENSUE FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND AS ANOTHER UPPER-RIDGE AXIS BUILDS
IN. THE NEXT UPPER-WAVE THAT WILL IMPACT THE REGION LOOKS AS THOUGH
IT WILL SHIFT TOWARD THE AREA LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY...RESULTING
IN SOME SLIGHT CHANCES FOR RAIN HEADING INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK.

SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND ERN GREAT LAKES 
REGION. SATELLITE PICS SHOW AN INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS AGAIN...ALTHO

THE 60S TO MID 70S...AS TEMPS GET SUCH A MILD START TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...EXPECTING PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AS SURFACE 
RIDGE EASES FURTHER EAST. A BIT STRONGER SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW 
SHOULD SPREAD SOME LOW CLOUDS INTO AT LEAST SRN 1/2 OF THE FORECAST 
AREA BY AND AFTER 06Z MONDAY. THIS ALL FAVORS GOING A FEW OR MORE 
DEGREES ABOVE THE GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT.

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LATEST MODEL RUNS STILL

ALLOWS A STRONG FRONT TO MOVE EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE IN 
THE WEEK. GFS SHOWS THE SYSTEM APPROACHING WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY WITH THE ECMWF NOT UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WITH THE

WARM AND BASICALLY DRY FROM MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH 
TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL MONDAY AND THEN EVEN 
WARMER TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. HIGHS REACH THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER 80S 
BOTH TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...AS WARM AS ITS BEEN SINCE LAST FALL. 
KEPT RAIN CHANCES IN WEDNESDAY NIGHT BUT BEST CHANCES FOR 
SIGNIFICANT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. A 
COLD FRONT THAT WILL BE HUNG UP ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY SHOULD START 
TO MOVE TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY WITH LOW PRESSURE MOVING 
INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. STRONG 
SOUTHWEST WINDS ALOFT AS EARLY AS EARLY THURSDAY MORNING BY THE GFS 
AND INSTABILITY SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR STRONG STORMS TO DEVELOP AHEAD

MORE NUMEROUS TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY COOLER. MUCH COOLER BEHIND THE

KEPT TEMPS UP SO FAR OVERNIGHT...SO IT WON'T TAKE MUCH SUNSHINE TO 
REACH THE 60S TO MID 70S...AS TEMPS GET SUCH A MILD START TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...EXPECTING PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES AS SURFACE 
RIDGE EASES FURTHER EAST. A BIT STRONGER SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW 
SHOULD SPREAD SOME LOW CLOUDS INTO AT LEAST SRN 1/2 OF THE FORECAST 
AREA BY AND AFTER 06Z MONDAY. THIS ALL FAVORS GOING A FEW OR MORE 
DEGREES ABOVE THE GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LATEST MODEL RUNS STILL
SHOWING DIFFERENCES IN TIMING OF WHEN UPPER RIDGING BREAKS DOWN AND
ALLOWS A STRONG FRONT TO MOVE EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE IN
THE WEEK. GFS SHOWS THE SYSTEM APPROACHING WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
THURSDAY WITH THE ECMWF NOT UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WITH
THE CANADIAN MOVING THROUGH THURSDAY. SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT KEEPS
REGION WARM AND BASICALLY DRY FROM MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH
TEMPERATURES SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL MONDAY AND THEN EVEN
WARMER TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. HIGHS REACH THE UPPER 70S TO LOWER
80S BOTH TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...AS WARM AS ITS BEEN SINCE LAST
FALL. KEPT RAIN CHANCES IN WEDNESDAY NIGHT BUT BEST CHANCES FOR
SIGNIFICANT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. 
A COLD FRONT THAT WILL BE HUNG UP ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY SHOULD
START TO MOVE TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY WITH LOW PRESSURE
MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.
STRONG SOUTHWEST WINDS ALOFT AS EARLY AS EARLY THURSDAY MORNING BY
THE GFS AND INSTABILITY SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR STRONG STORMS TO
DEVELOP AHEAD OF THE FRONT THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. WITH
SHOWERS AND CLOUDS MORE NUMEROUS TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY COOLER.
MUCH COOLER BEHIND THE FRONT FRIDAY AND SATURDAY WITH SKIES
CLEARING SATURDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.

.SHORT TERM SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL INCREASE AS HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS 
EAST OF THE AREA. WARMING TREND BEGINS TONIGHT AND CONTINUES SUNDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL SUNDAY. HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDS WILL STREAM INTO THE AREA IN UPPER SW-W FLOW. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS REVEAL SOME 
TIMING DIFFERENCES WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF A STRONG COLD 
FRONT FOR LATE NEXT WEEK...WHICH WILL REALLY BE THE ONLY NOTABLE 
WEATHER FEATURE TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD. 
A DEEP SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW WILL CONTINUE OVER THE FORECAST AREA 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...RESULTING IN A WARMING TREND WITH 
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS UNTIL THE FRONTAL PASSAGE LATER IN THE WEEK. A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED TO LINGER OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY EARLY IN THE WEEK...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED CONVECTIVE 
ACTIVITY EXPECTED TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. GFS MODEL 
REMAINS FASTER THAN THE ECMWF MODEL WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF 
THE COLD FRONT FOR LATE IN THE WEEK...WITH THE GFS MODEL SHOWING A 
THURSDAY PASSAGE AND THE ECMWF MODEL SHOWING A FRIDAY PASSAGE. 
DESPITE THE TIMING DIFFERENCES...BOTH MODELS AGREE THAT A STRONG 
WIND FIELD AND MODERATE LEVELS OF INSTABILITY WILL COMBINE TO 
PRODUCE SOME STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVES SE 
THROUGH THE AREA THROUGH THE PERIOD. DRY CONDITIONS AND LIGHT WINDS 
CAN BE EXPECTED. NEUTRAL TEMPERATURE ADVECTION TONIGHT WITH WARM AIR 
ADVECTION SATURDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL RISE TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL. 
A MID LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE ITO THE WESTERN OH VALLEY BY 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. THIS FEATURE MAY BRING SOME HIGH CLOUDINESS 
ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS LATE. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE REMAINDER OF THE 
WEEKEND WILL BE DRY WITH TEMPERATURES AT OR SLIGHTLY WARMER THAN 
AVERAGE. 

THE UPPER FLOW WILL GENERALLY BE ZONAL WITH A FEW EMBEDDED 
SHORTWAVES ENHANCING SOME HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS. BY MONDAY A 
DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN U.S. AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW IS 
EXPECTED TO ADVECT WARMER TEMPERATURES AND HIGHER LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL CAUSE DAYTIME HIGHS TO RISE INTO 
THE UPPER 70S AND 80S BY TUESDAY. 

THE MODELS VARY SIGNIFICANTLY WITH REGARDS TO TIMING. THE ECMWF IS 
ABOUT 24 HOURS SLOWER WITH THE FRONT WHILE THE GFS IS THE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE. THE LOW-RES EC WANTS TO DIG THE WESTERN TROUGH INTO 
SOUTHWEST ARIZONA. IF THIS VERIFIES THE FRONT WILL NOT MOVE THROUGH 
OUR AREA BY WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER THE GFS DRAGS THE FRONT INTO E TN/SW 
VA BY WEDNESDAY. THE DEEP UPPER FLOW ADVERTISED BY THE GFS BECOMES 
PARALLEL TO THE SURFACE FRONT. THE SLOW MOVING OR NEARLY STALLED 
FRONT REMAINS IN THE AREA AND PRECIPITATION CHANCES PERSIST THROUGH 
THURSDAY NIGHT. NEEDLESS TO SAY THE TIMING OF THE PRECIPITATION AND 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY CAUSE A HIGH LEVEL OF UNCERTAINTY THUS CONFIDENCE 
IS RATHER LOW. SOMETHING TO WATCH WILL BE THE INSTABILITY AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT WHENEVER IT DOES DECIDE TO MOVE THROUGH THE REGION BECAUSE 
A FEW STORMS COULD BE SEVERE.

LOW PRESSURE CENTER ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA COAST. SOME SCATTERED 
PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN ACROSS EXTREME SRN COUNTIES CURRENTLY AND

CAN'T REACH A MOS BLEND FOR HIGHS TODAY.

OTHERWISE...STILL LOOKS MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY TONIGHT AS AN 
UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILD INTO THE REGION. 
LIGHT NORTHERLY WINDS AND LACK OF CLOUDS FAVORS THE COOLER MOS MINS. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...ZONAL FLOW WITH RIDGING
ALOFT ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES BRINGS MUCH WARMER WEATHER FOR

NORMAL EACH DAY. LOW PRESSURE OVER THE GREAT LAKES WITH FRONT

BEFORE SAGGING SOUTH TOWARD THE TN VALLEY WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.
THE COLD FRONT WILL APPROACHES THE EAST TN AREA LATE THURSDAY
INCREASING RAIN CHANCES. TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH CONTINUES 
OVER THE AREA TONIGHT AS SURFACE LOW MOVES NE THROUGH GA AND SC.
UPPER LOW WILL MOVE EAST THROUGH THE SOUTH WITH AXIS CROSSING EAST 
OF THE AREA AROUND 05/12Z. BEST ISENTROPIC LIFT AND UPPER DIVERGENCE 
WILL MOVE NE OF AREA TONIGHT. RAIN CHANCES REMAIN HIGH EARLY TONIGHT 
BUT COVERAGE AND AMOUNTS WILL BE LESS THAN TODAY. UPPER DRY SLOT 
MOVING NE INTO THE AREA LOWERING PWATS. LOW LEVEL AIRMASS WILL 
CHANGE LITTLE TONIGHT WITH FOGGY CONDITIONS AND NEARLY STEADY 
TEMPERATURES. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST FRIDAY WITH 
DRIER AIRMASS. MAX TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE BELOW NORMAL. 

.LONG TERM...GENERALLY A ZONAL SOUTHERN STREAM FLOW WILL START THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD FOR THIS WEEKEND WITH SURFACE RIDGING INTO THE 
SOUTHEAST UNITED STATES. FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
NEAR FREEZING AT TRI...BUT NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO WARRANT A FREEZE 
WATCH. 

A MODERATION OF THICKNESS/850MB TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE WEEKEND 
WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO BECOME MORE SEASONAL TO SLIGHT ABOVE BY 
SUNDAY. FAST ZONAL FLOW WILL ALLOW PERIODS OF HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TO 
SPREAD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE CIRRO-STRATUS WILL BE THICK AT 
TIMES PRODUCING MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES...BUT OVERALL WILL GO WITH 
PARTLY CLOUDY FOR THE WEEKEND.

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...A STRONG LONG-WAVE UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO 
THE WESTERN HALF OF THE COUNTRY. THE DOWNSTREAM UPPER RIDGE WILL 
STRENGTHEN OVER THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION WITH UNSEASONABLY 
WARM TEMPERATURES FOR THE FIRST HALF OF NEXT WEEK AS WELL AS DRY 
CONDITIONS. WE MAY HAVE FIRE WEATHER ISSUES EARLY NEXT WEEK AS 
AIRMASS WILL REMAIN DRY AND SOUTHWEST WINDS WILL INCREASE.

FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BECOME 
LIKELY FOR THURSDAY. WILL NEED TO WATCH THE LATTER HALF OF NEXT WEEK 
FOR THE POTENTIAL OF STRONG-SEVERE STORMS.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED MEX MOS THROUGHOUT THE FORECAST.

VALLEY AND LOW CHANCE POPS EASTERN MOUNTAINS EARLY FRIDAY FOR A FEW 
LINGERING SHOWERS...THEN DRIER AIR WILL MOVE IN.  HIGH PRESSURE AT

SET UP TO OUR EAST. MEANWHILE LOW AMPLITUDE RIDGE ALOFT WILL BUILD

315 PM EDT TUE APR 2 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...MUCH DRIER AIR MASS HAS WORKED 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON WITH TEMPERATURES ONLY IN THE 
MID 40S TO MID 50S AT MID AFTERNOON. THE TEMPERATURES ARE A FEW 
DEGREES LOWER THAN ORIGINALLY FORECAST. DEW POINTS HAVE FALLEN INTO 
THE TEENS TO MID 20S. HIGH PRESSURE WORKING SOUTHEAST FROM THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS WAS IN CONTRAST TO SOUTHERN PLAINS SYSTEM THAT WAS 
ALREADY SPREADING A COLD RAIN INTO WESTERN ARKANSAS WITH 
THUNDERSTORMS IN OKLAHOMA AND TEXAS.

MAIN FORECAST PROBLEM TONIGHT IS EXTENT OF CLOUD COVER ACROSS 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS AND POTENTIAL RAIN SHOWERS AND LOWS CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN SECTIONS. WITH LARGE TEMPERATURE...DEW POINT SPREADS AND 
SOME LIGHT WINDS POTENTIAL FOR FROST NOT TO GOOD BUT TEMPERATURES 
STILL LOOK TO DROP TO FREEZING OR BELOW FROM CENTRAL EAST TN NORTH. 
WILL CHANGE FREEZE WATCH TO FREEZE WARNING WITH ZONE FORECAST 
ISSUANCE. WEDNESDAY STILL ON TRACK FOR SUNSHINE NORTHERN TWO THIRDS 
AND SLIGHTLY WARMER WITH MOSTLY CLOUDY SOUTH. HIGHS WEDNESDAY A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER THAN TODAY IN THE 50S TO NEAR 60.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND GENERALLY REVEAL A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHEAST BRINGING LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. MODELS 
SOUNDINGS REVEAL A WARM VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY MORNING...SO DO NOT EXPECT ANY WINTRY PRECIP INITIALLY AS 
THE RAIN SPREADS NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THE BEST 
COVERAGE OF RAIN SHOULD BE ON THURSDAY NIGHT...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. THEREAFTER...AN AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE WESTERN 
ATLANTIC...WHICH WILL BRING A WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. AN UPPER-LEVEL 
RIDGE IS ALSO PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHEAST BY EARLY NEXT 
WEEK...WHICH WILL HELP TO CAUSE TEMPS TO WARM ABOVE NORMAL WITH A 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY BECOMING QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO RIVER 
VALLEY. WITH THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY EXPECTED TO REMAIN NORTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA...EXPECT DRY CONDITIONS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

.SHORT TERM TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL EXTEND 
INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.  SOME

TRACK WILL LIE TO OUR SOUTH AND MAY CARRY IN A FEW BANDS OF CLOUDS.  
THE HIGH WILL LIFT NORTHEAST AND OUT OF THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS 
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SLIDES NORTHEAST AND INTO THE AREA.  PRECIP 
WILL SPREAD FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH 
CATEGORICAL POPS FOR THURSDAY.  COULD SEE SOME LIGHT SNOW OVER FAR 
NORTHERN LOCATION AND HIGHER TERRAIN LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...COLD FRONT IS NOW
MOVING THROUGH EXTREME EASTERN TENNESSEE WITH A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS
AHEAD OF IT. WINDS HAVE SWITCHED TO THE NW AND ARE USHERING IN A
COLDER AND DRIER AIR MASS. TEMPERATURES HAVE WARMED TO THE UPPER
50S TO UPPER 60S FOR THE MOST PART BUT A LITTLE COLDER IN SW VA
HIGHER VALLEYS. TONIGHT SKIES WILL BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR AND DROP
INTO THE 30S BUT BELOW FREEZING HIGHER ELEVATIONS BY TUESDAY
MORNING. PATCHY FROST IN SHELTERED VALLEYS NORTH LATE BUT WINDS AND
DRIER AIR MASS SHOULD LIMIT COVERAGE OF FROST. TUESDAY A COOLER
MOSTLY SUNNY DAY WITH HIGHS IN THE 50S. TUESDAY NIGHT LOWS EXPECTED
TO BE BELOW FREEZING FROM AROUND INTERSTATE 40 NORTH SO ISSUED A
FREEZE WATCH FOR NORTHERN TN AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. ACROSS
SOUTHEAST TN SYSTEM MOVING SE FROM THE PLAINS TUESDAY WILL SPREAD
CLOUDS INTO THAT AREA TUESDAY NIGHT. MODELS TRY TO BRING A LITTLE
RAIN IN BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP IT DRY.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...BY WEDNESDAY THE UPPER 
TROUGH OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL BEGIN TO TRANSITION EASTWARD. 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE ENTRENCHED OVER THE FORECAST AREA AND 
SLIDE OFF THE VA/NC COASTLINE. THE NEXT SHORTWAVE WILL TRANSLATE 
ACROSS WEST TEXAS AND INTO TENNESSEE THURSDAY. INCREASING 
MOISTURE...FIRST IN THE FORM OF CLOUDS WILL SPREAD OVER THE AREA. 
THEN LIGHT RAIN WILL INCREASE IN COVERAGE AND INTENSITY FROM SOUTH 
TO NORTH BEGINNING DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY AND PERSIST INTO 
FRIDAY. IT MAY TAKE A WHILE TO SATURATE THE LOWER LEVELS OF THE 
ATMOSPHERE ON THURSDAY SO RAINFALL MAY BE SLOW TO ACCUMULATE UNTIL 
THURSDAY EVENING WHEN THE COLUMN BECOMES SATURATED. CURRENTLY ALL OF 
THE MODELS ARE IN EXCELLENT AGREEMENT WITH THE HIGHEST RAINFALL 
TOTALS SITUATED GENERALLY SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40. A FEW LOCATIONS 
COULD SEE LOCAL TOTAL RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS OF A LITTLE OVER AN 
INCH WITH SEVERAL LOCATIONS GETTING A HALF INCH OR MORE.  THE UPPER 
AIR PATTERN AFTER FRIDAY NIGHT BECOMES MORE ZONAL AND SHOULD HELP 
THE AREA TO NEAR SEASONAL NORMS I.E. WARMER.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...
EXTRAPOLATION OF PRECIP NOW OVER MIDDLE/WEST TN BRINGS THE BACK EDGE 
TO A TRI-TYS-CHA LINE AROUND 00Z...AND TO THE MOUNTAINS AROUND 01Z. 
WILL CARRY SOME LIKELY POPS IN SW NC AFTER 00Z WITH CHANCE POPS IN 
THE VALLEY. THERE IS NOT MUCH SURFACE DRY AIR OBSERVED UPSTREAM 
BEHIND THE WEAK SURFACE FRONT...SO DEWPOINTS WILL ONLY DROP SLIGHTLY 
TONIGHT FROM CURRENT VALUES. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN LOW STRATUS OR 
FOG DEVELOPMENT. MIXING FROM LIGHT WINDS IN NORTHERN AREAS SHOULD 
GIVE LOW CLOUDS THERE...WITH CALM WINDS SOUTH PRODUCING FOG. WILL 
MENTION PATCHY FOG NORTH AND AREAS OF FOG SOUTH. 

A STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING INTO THE AREA TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON. HOWEVER MOISTURE AHEAD OF THIS FRONT IS MUCH MORE LIMITED 
AS THE MID/UPPER TROUGH IS VERY BROAD. WILL HAVE SOME LOW TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE DAY WITH LIGHT QPF. TEMPS WILL BE VERY 
DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER...WHICH IS VERY UNCERTAIN RIGHT NOW. GIVEN 
THE EXPECTED FOG AND LOW CLOUDS IN THE MORNING THAT WILL HAVE TO 
BURN OFF...AND ADDITIONAL HIGHER CLOUDS IN THE AFTERNOON WITH THE 
FRONT...WENT ON THE COOL SIDE OF MOS FOR HIGHS...FROM UPPER 50S 
NORTH TO UPPER 60S SOUTH. A MUCH COLDER AIR MASS WILL BEGIN TO 
INFILTRATE THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT. GRADUAL CLEARING FROM THE NORTH 
WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO FALL INTO THE LOWER 30S NORTH TO AROUND 40 
SOUTH. A FREEZE WARNING MAY BE NEEDED LATER...BUT AT THIS TIME IT 
APPEARS TOO MARGINAL TO GO WITH A FREEZE WATCH.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A BROAD UPPER TROUGH SETS THE STAGE FOR BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES
THROUGH THE MAJORITY OF THE EXTENDED. ON TUESDAY WE ARE STILL UNDER
THE INFLUENCE OF THE UPPER TROUGH TO OUR NORTH...WHICH WILL HELP TO
KEEP TEMPS BELOW NORMAL. THE QUESTION IS...WHERE WILL THE BOUNDARY
SETTLE THAT IS ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER TROUGH. LATEST 12Z NAM AND GFS
MOVING IN OPPOSITE DIRECTIONS REGARDING POSITIONING OF BOUNDARY.
12Z NAM BRINGS BOUNDARY FURTHER NORTH THAN 06Z RUN...WHICH PUTS THE
BOUNDARY DIRECTLY OVER OUR AREA. 12Z GFS PUSHES THE BOUNDARY
FURTHER SOUTH COMPARED TO 06Z RUN...WHICH PLACES IT SOUTH OF OUR
AREA. AT THIS TIME...WILL STILL TREND TOWARD THE GFS AND
EURO...THUS A DRIER SOLUTION. LATER SHIFTS MAY HAVE TO INTRODUCE
POPS DURING THE TUESDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME IF BOUNDARY DOES INDEED
END UP DRAPED ACROSS OUR AREA. TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY THE
TROUGH BEGINS TO MOVE EAST OF OUR AREA BUT A LARGE COLD SURFACE
RIDGE EDGES IN FROM THE NORTHWEST BEHIND THE DEPARTING TROUGH. THE
CENTER OF THE SURFACE HIGH REMAINS TO OUR NORTH AND WILL SLOWLY
MIGRATE EAST ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THIS FEATURE WILL CAUSE
TEMPERATURES TO BE A GOOD FIVE TO TEN DEGREES BELOW NORMAL TUESDAY
THROUGH THURSDAY.

A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE LOCATED ACROSS THE ARKALATEX REGION 
BEGINS TO APPROACH OUR AREA LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. 
PREVIOUS FORECASTS TIMING AND CHANCE OF POPS LOOKED PRETTY GOOD. SO 
DIDN'T REALLY CHANGE MUCH OTHER THAN A FEW MINOR TWEAKS. KEPT THE 
NICE PROGRESSION OF CHANCE POPS LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INCREASING TO 
LIKELY PROBABILITY FOR SHOWERS FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST DURING 
THE DAY THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE WAVE PROGRESSES EAST. 
MAINTAINED SOME RATHER HIGH POPS EARLY ON FRIDAY AS SLOW MOVING 
TROUGH DOES NOT SHIFT EAST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS UNTIL LATER 
IN THE DAY FRIDAY OR FRIDAY NIGHT. LATEST 12Z GFS HINTS AT WAVE 
EXITING A LITTLE QUICKER ON FRIDAY COMPARED TO PREVIOUS RUNS...WILL 
KEEP POPS UNCHANGED FOR NOW. IF THE TREND OF A QUICKER EXIT 
CONTINUES...MAY HAVE TO SCALE BACK POPS FOR FRIDAY. TEMPS WILL 
CONTINUE TO REMAIN BELOW NORMAL ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY DUE TO THE 
COLD SURFACE RIDGE NOW OFF TO OUR NORTHEAST. THE PLACEMENT OF THE 
CENTER OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL HELP TO SUPPRESS THE SOUTHERN STREAM 
SHORT WAVES SOUTHERLY SURFACE FLOW UP INTO OUR AREA. PRECIP AND 
CLOUD COVER ON THURSDAY/FRIDAY SHOULD ALSO AID IN BELOW NORMAL TEMPS. 

MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT SOUTHERLY FLOW AND INCREASING 
HEIGHTS BEGIN TO MAKE A RETURN ON SATURDAY AND INTO SUNDAY...HELPING 
US TO CLIMB CLOSER TO SEASONAL NORMALS AND PERHAPS EVEN SLIGHTLY 
ABOVE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
RAIN OVER NRN AL ASSOCIATED WITH A WARM FRONT IS PROJECTED TO REACH 
CHA BEFORE 00Z...AND SPREAD NORTHWARD ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE 
NIGHT. THE STRONGEST LIFT OCCURS OVER THE AREA AROUND 06Z JUST AHEAD 
OF THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH AXIS AND IN THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF AN UPPER 
JET STREAK. AVERAGE QPF AMOUNTS OF A HALF INCH ARE FORECAST...WITH 
CATEGORICAL POPS EVERYWHERE. A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER WILL BE 
MENTIONED SOUTH WHERE THERE WILL BE SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
OVERNIGHT. 

WE SHOULD SEE A BRIEF LULL IN THE PRECIP SUNDAY MORNING BEFORE A 
SECOND MIDLEVEL TROUGH AND UPPER JET APPROACH THE AREA IN THE 
AFTERNOON. A PERIOD OF BROKEN CLOUDS MAY ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE INTO 
THE MID 60S IN THE VALLEY. FORCING FOR LIFT APPEARS A BIT WEAK AS 
THE FLOW IS NOT VERY AMPLIFIED...BUT THERE WILL BE BETTER 
SURFACE-BASED INSTABILITY AVAILABLE. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS SOUTH AND 
CHANCE POPS NORTH IN THE AFTERNOON...WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDER 
EVERYWHERE. COLD FRONT PASSAGE OCCURS SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH LIFT AND 
MOISTURE SHIFTING TO OUR EAST AFTER MIDNIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
THE MODELS REMAIN A LITTLE BOUNCY IN THEIR SOLUTIONS. NOW THE
MONDAY NIGHT EVENT LOOKS VERY PIDDLY...MOSTLY A PATCH OF CLOUDINESS
WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH OVERNIGHT WITHOUT MUCH MEASURABLE
PRECIP...MAINTAINED 20 PERCENTS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND SW VA.
OTHERWISE A DRY SPELL WILL HOLD THROUGH WEDNESDAY. MORE
SIGNIFICANTLY...THE 00Z EC CONTINUES WITH ITS WET SOLUTION FOR
THURSDAY...AND NOW THE 12Z GFS HAS COME INTO GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH
THE EC...AND EVEN THE CANADIAN IS WET FOR THURSDAY. SO...I WILL RUN
MY POPS CLOSE TO THE MAX ENSEMBLE POP FROM THE 00Z
ENSEMBLES...MEANING 60 PERCENT POPS CROSSING THE CWA THURSDAY AND
THURSDAY NIGHT. ADJUSTED MAX TEMPS DOWN A LITTLE ON THURS TO MORE
CLOSELY MATCH THE WETTER 12Z GFS EXTENDED MOS. DRY WEATHER RESUMES

THERE WILL BE SOME SUNSHINE TO LIFT SPIRITS DURING THIS PERIOD. 
MODEL SOLUTIONS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT TOWARD THE END OF THE LONG

STREAM SYSTEM FOR THE THURSDAY/FRIDAY TIME FRAME WHILE THE GFS AND 
CANADIAN SHOW A SLIGHTLY WEAKER AND MORE SUPPRESSED SYSTEM. EDGED 
THE FORECAST A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE MORE SUPPRESSED SCENARIO WITH A

OVERALL FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES 
OVERNIGHT. A WARM FRONT ACROSS NORTHERN ALABAMA/GEORGIA WITH 
SOUTHERLY WINDS OVER-RIDING THE BOUNDARY IS PRODUCING ISENTROPIC 
LIFT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THIS LIFT IS RESPONSIBLE FOR A 
BAND OF LIGHT RAIN OVER THE TYS AIRPORT. THIS AREA OF RAIN WILL 
REMAIN ACROSS TYS AND MOVE INTO CHA OVERNIGHT AND CONTINUE THROUGH 
06-08Z. 

THE CONTINUED SOUTHERLY FLOW ALOFT WILL PULL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA 
OVERNIGHT HELPING TO LOWER THE CLOUD CEILINGS. CURRENT MVFR 
CONDITIONS WILL BECOME MVFR AT TYS AND CHA THROUGH 15Z. VFR 
CONDITIONS WILL RETURN SATURDAY AFTERNOON. WINDS WILL REMAIN FAIRLY 
LIGHT THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...GENERALLY LESS THAN 10KTS.

304 PM EDT FRI MAR 29 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
LIGHT RAIN MOVING INTO THE AREA APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH A 300 
MB JET STREAK OVER VA/NC AND ISENTROPIC LIFT AT THE 295-300 K LEVEL. 
CENTRAL AREAS APPEAR TO BE IN LINE FOR THE BEST LIFT AND GREATEST 
QPF THROUGH MIDNIGHT. WILL CONTINUE LIKELY POPS THROUGH THE 
EVENING...LOWERING TO CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AFTER MIDNIGHT AS 
THESE FEATURES MOVE EAST OF THE AREA. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LINGERS 
INTO THE MORNING IN THE NAM AND GFS...WITH SOME PARTIAL CLEARING BY 
NOON. THIS SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH OF A WINDOW FOR SUNSHINE TO BRING 
HIGHS INTO THE 60S IN MOST SPOTS...BEFORE CLOUDS BEGIN TO INCREASE 
FROM THE SW LATE IN THE DAY AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THINGS LOOK A LITTLE SPED UP TODAY COMPARED TO YESTERDAY. NOW THE
FROPA AND SHWRS/TSTMS ARE HITTING HIGH POPS SATURDAY NIGHT AND
SUNDAY MORNING BEFORE HEADING OUT OF THE AREA. THE SECOND FROPA
BRINGING IN THE COLDER AIR IS AROUND LATE MONDAY. GOOD CONFIDENCE
IN THE SEASONABLY WARM TEMPS SUNDAY AND MONDAY. THE COOL DOWN
BEHIND THE SECOND FRONT ON TUESDAY WON'T LINGER TOO LONG...AS TEMPS
WILL REBOUND CLOSE TO NORMAL ON THURSDAY. EXTENDED MODELS STILL
STRUGGLING WITH LATE PERIOD EVENT. GFS IS NOW DRY WITH A SOUTHERN
STREAM SYSTEM IMPACTING THE GULF COAST WHILE THE EC HAS A DEEPER
TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS BRINGING UP GREATER MOISTURE AND SIGNIFICANT
PRECIP INTO TE AREA LATE THURS/EARLY FRI. WASN/T THE EC THE DRIER
MODEL YESTERDAY AND THE GFS THE WETTER CONCERNING LATE NEXT WEEK?
WILL STICK WITH LOW CHANCE POPS FOR LATE NEXT WEEK TIL THINGS ARE A
LITTLE LESS UNCERTAIN.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL SPREAD 
INTO ESPECIALLY CENTRAL ZONES TODAY...BRINGING SOME LIGHT RAIN.  NAM 
DEPICTION OF CURRENT PRECIP LOOKS BETTER THAN THE GFS...SO WILL LEAN 
TOWARD THE NAM SOLUTION.  EXPECT RAINFALL AMOUNTS TO BE QUITE LIGHT 
GIVEN LIMITED MOISTURE INFLUX AND WEAK FORCING...BUT THINK LIKELY 
POPS WARRANTED CENTRAL WITH CHANCE NORTH AND SOUTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE 
FAR NORTH FOR THIS AFTERNOON.  A FEW PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN OR 
DRIZZLE MAY LINGER INTO TONIGHT...WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ALL 
ZONES.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL...SO WILL STAY CLOSE FOR 
THE MOST PART.     

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN FOR 
THE FIRST SEVERAL DAYS OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST AS THREE FEATURES 
AFFECT THE REGION. THE EARLY PART OF THE FORECAST WILL FEEL A LITTLE 
MORE LIKE SPRING WITH TEMPERATURES CLOSER TO NORMAL FOR LATE MARCH 
AND EARLY APRIL. THE INITIAL SYSTEM IS A LOW AMPLITUDE WAVE THAT 
BUILDS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST U.S. ON SATURDAY. THERE MIGHT BE A 
SHOWER OR TWO ACROSS MAINLY THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE VIEWING AREA AS 
MOISTURE IS LIFTED IN A WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN ACROSS THE 
REGION. NEXT AN UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT ADVANCE 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND SWINGS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY. JACKED UP POPS FOR SHOWERS WELL AHEAD OF THE 
FEATURE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY WITH CONVECTION POSSIBLE DURING 
THE DAY SUNDAY JUST AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. DRIER AIR BUILDS INTO 
THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. HOWEVER...A MORE AMPLIFIED 
UPPER TROUGH DROPS INTO THE EASTERN U.S. LATER MONDAY INTO TUESDAY 
BRINGING MORE SHOWERS AND MUCH COLDER AIR BACK INTO THE AREA. 
COLD...DRY CANADIAN HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY PULLING TEMPERATURES A GOOD FIVE TO TEN 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. A SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM BUILDS EAST ACROSS 
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AND ADDED 
SOME SMALL POPS FOR SHOWERS AT THE END OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD FOR 
THIS POSSIBILITY. HAD TO UNDERCUT GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST (SMALL DEVIATION INITIALLY FOLLOWED BY GREATER DEVIATION) 
DUE TO THE BLOCKING PATTERN WHICH IS NOT ALLOWING A MORE TYPICAL 
SPRING TO EMERGE ACROSS NORTH AMERICA.

APPEARS TO BE OVERDONE WITH ITS QPF AND POPS (ABOUT 70 PERCENT 
HIGHER THAN ABOVE GFS MOS) CONSIDERING THE WEAK LIFT AND LACK OF

AFTERNOON AND CONTINUING THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH THE HIGHEST 
CHANCES SOUTH. WE SHOULD SEE ENOUGH SUNSHINE FRIDAY MORNING TO BRING

HUMIDITY SATURDAY...IN LIEU OF FRONTAL PASSAGE SUNDAY THAT WILL BE
ACCOMPANIED BY AT LEAST LIKELY POPS FOR SHOWERS...AND A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS POSSIBLE ALSO. THE COOL DOWN BEHIND THIS FRONT WILL

WILL SLOWLY DECREASE OVERNIGHT. FORECAST MINS IN LINE WITH LAMP 
DATA. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...THERE IS LITTLE CHANGE TO THE 
OVERALL WEATHER PATTERN THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD AS LOW 
PRESSURE REMAINS NEARLY STATIONARY OFF THE COAST OF NOVA SCOTIA. A 
NW FLOW WILL CONTINUE OVER OUR AREA...WITH COOL MIDLEVEL TEMPS OVER 
NORTHERN SECTIONS PROVIDING AN OVERCAST TO BROKEN STRATOCU DECK. 
ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS MAY CLIP WISE AND RUSSELL COUNTIES 
OVERNIGHT...BUT NO ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED. A SURFACE RIDGE WILL 
BUILD IN TONIGHT...AND LOWS WILL DROP INTO THE UPPER 20S TO LOWER 
30S. THE FREEZE WARNING LOOKS ON TRACK AND WILL BE UNCHANGED. SOME 
MIDLEVEL STABILIZATION AND RISING 500 MB HEIGHTS TOMORROW SHOULD 
RESULT IN LESS CLOUD COVER FOR NORTHERN AREAS. HIGHS WILL REACH INTO 
THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS...WITH 40S CONTINUING FOR SW VA AND THE TN 
MOUNTAINS. 

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WILL BE IN AN 
UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED.  SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE OVER THE REGION THURSDAY NIGHT WILL SLIDE EAST OF THE AREA 
AS A SHORT WAVE MOVES IN ON FRIDAY.  PRECIP WILL MOVE IN FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARM ENOUGH 
FOR ALL RAIN.  ANOTHER WAVE MOVES IN QUICKLY ON ITS HEELS ON 
SATURDAY.  THEN...THE FIRST OF TWO COLD FRONTS PUSHES IN ON SUNDAY 
FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS.  WEAK INSTABILITY ACCOMPANYING THE 
FRONT MAY PROVIDE SOME EMBEDDED THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL.  THERE IS 
SOME DISCREPANCY IN TIMING...BUT THE SECOND FRONT SHOULD REACH INTO 
THE AREA AROUND MONDAY NIGHT.  ANOTHER ROUND OF COLD...OR AT LEAST 
COOLER AIR...WILL FILTER IN BEHIND THE SECOND FRONT BRINGING 
TEMPERATURES DOWN TO BELOW NORMAL LEVELS.  WILL LEAVE LOW POPS IN 
PLACE THROUGH THE REST OF THE EXTENDED AS THE FRONT EXITS THE REGION

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WRAP-AROUND LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE
WILL CONTINUE TO PULL INTO THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA
TODAY AND FAR NORTHEAST TONIGHT. OROGRAPHIC LIFT INTO THE HIGHER

OF FLURRIES OVER THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE AREA. TEMPERATURES WILL
ONCE AGAIN BE UNSEASONABLY COOL TODAY WITH A FREEZE LIKELY TONIGHT.
EVEN THOUGH IT HAS BEEN COLD THE PAST WEEK...AREA BERRIES AND FRUIT

HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION ON THURSDAY. THIS 
HIGH IS PROGGED TO DRIFT SOUTHEASTWARD THROUGH FRIDAY...WITH

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST...WITH A LARGE AREA OF 
HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE PLAINS. THE PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN 
THESE TWO SYSTEMS WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE GUSTY WINDS OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA TODAY...BUT WIND SPEEDS SHOULD STAY BELOW ADVISORY 
CRITERIA. AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL SWING ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY...AND WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE SNOW SHOWERS THROUGH THE 
AFTERNOON. THESE SNOW SHOWERS AND THE WESTERLY WINDS WILL GRADUALLY 
DIMINISH AFTER SUNSET THIS EVENING. WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER STORM 
WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES WITHOUT ANY CHANGES. TEMPS ACROSS THE LOWER 
ELEVATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOVE FREEZING FOR MOST OF THE DAY... 
SO THINK THAT MOST SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS 
SHOULD BE ON GRASSY SURFACES. OUTSIDE OF THE WARNING AND ADVISORY 
AREAS...TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO RISE INTO THE 40S THIS AFTERNOON...SO 
THINK THAT ANY SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN THESE AREAS SHOULD BE 
AROUND AN INCH OR LESS. SINCE AREA GROWERS HAVE INDICATED THAT THE

GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...PERSISTENT UPPER TROUGH OFF 
THE NORTHEAST/MID-ATLANTIC COAST WILL FINALLY RELEASE ITS EFFECTS ON 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY LATE WEDNESDAY/WEDNESDAY NIGHT WITH THE 
LOW CLOUDS ERODING. WILL CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS FOR 
THE HIGHER MOUNTAINS OF FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY.

DRIER NORTHWEST FLOW AND SURFACE RIDGING WILL DOMINATE THE FORECAST
FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MOST OF SATURDAY. SURFACE RIDGING AND 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKY WILL PRODUCE GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS

NIGHT. AFTER TALKING WITH LOCAL CROP SPECIALIST...AREA BERRIES AND 
FRUIT TREES HAVE PROGRESSED FAR ENOUGH ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
AND PLATEAU THAT FREEZING TEMPERATURES ARE AN IMPACT. WILL INCLUDE A 
FREEZE WATCH FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT.

FOR LATE SATURDAY THOUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...THE GFS AND ECMWF SHOW A

A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATE

350 PM EDT MON MAR 25 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MAINTAINED CURRENT WINTER STORM 
WATCH AND WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY AREAS. IN A LATE MARCH SNOW EVENT 
EMPHASIS WILL BE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE VERY COLD AIR ALOFT AND 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT SUPPORT HEAVY SNOWFALL. TRAILING SHORT WAVE FEATURE 
ROTATES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT ENHANCING 
SNOWFALL. WOULD EXPECT ROAD SURFACE TEMPERATURE TO ALLOW FOR A FAIR 
AMOUNT OF MELTING DEEP INTO THE EVENING MOST OF THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN VALLEY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR THE SNOWFLAKES 
TO HAVE A BETTER CHANCE AT ACCUMULATING...ESPECIALLY LATER 
TONIGHT...ACROSS THE ADVISORY AREAS INCLUDING THE NORTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. 
COLD AIR ALOFT SUPPORTS INTENSE LAPSE RATES AGAIN DURING THE DAY 
TUESDAY IN A MOIST ENVIRONMENT AND WOULD EXPECT THE POSSIBILITY OF 
SOME MORNING SLICK SPOTS ON ROADS ACROSS THE ADVISORY AREA BEFORE 
SURFACE TEMPERATURES EDGE ABOVE FREEZING...AS WAS THE CASE TODAY. 
UNDERCUT TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE IN THIS COLD AND CLOUDY REGIME. 
FINALLY...MAINTAINED THE WIND ADVISORY THROUGH EARLY EVENING AS 
CONVECTIVE MIXING APPEARS TO CONTINUE TO PULL HIGHER SPEED FLOW TO 
THE SURFACE. WIND SPEED SHOULD DROP BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA AFTER 
SUNSET.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS INTO THE AREA FROM THE WEST...BECOMING CENTERED OVER THE AREA 
BY FRI NIGHT. PERSISTENT NW FLOW ALOFT WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW 
NORMAL. UPSLOPE SHOWERS REMAIN POSSIBLE ACROSS FAVORED AREAS THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. SURFACE RIDGE SLIDES EAST OVER THE WEEKEND. TEMPERATURES 
WARM BACK UP TO NEAR NORMAL BY SUNDAY AHEAD OF STRONG COLD FRONT. 
BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION ON SUNDAY WITH COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE 
EARLY MONDAY.

.DISCUSSION...CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AS DEEP LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM CONTINUES TO SLIP SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY.
AREA RADARS REVEAL LIGHT SNOW FALLING ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA.
SURFACE AIRMASS WARM ENOUGH IN LOWER ELEVATIONS CENTRAL EAST AND
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE FOR LIGHT ACCUMULATION ON THE GRASS. AS THE
SURFACE WARMS LAPSE RATES WILL INCREASE ALLOWING FOR SOME BURSTS OF
SNOW AS CONVECTION DEVELOPS. WARNING PRODUCT STILL LOOKS ON TRACK
FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE LOWER TEMPERATURES WILL HELP TO
PRODUCE MORE EFFECTIVE SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION WITH ADDITIONAL HELP
FROM OROGRAPHIC LIFT. NO SIGNIFICANT WARMING ON TAP FOR TODAY WITH
TEMPERATURES TOPPING OUT IN THE 30S NORTH AND JUST BARELY MAKING IT
INTO THE LOWER 40S ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTH. AS THE STRONGER FLOW
ALOFT MIXES DOWN TO THE SURFACE IN THE STEEP LAPSE RATE ENVIRONMENT
WIND SPEED WILL POP INTO THE ADVISORY RANGE SO WILL KEEP THE NPW 
GOING.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
400 AM EDT MON MAR 25 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN OHIO...WITH AN OCCLUDED 
FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH OF IT ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THIS LOW 
AND A LARGE HIGH PRESSURE AREA OVER THE PLAINS WILL GENERATE VERY 
STRONG WESTERLY WINDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. IN ADDITION...A 
LARGE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WILL 
HELP TO GENERATE SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE REGION TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL FAIRLY STEEP LOW-LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES...WITH CAPE VALUES BETWEEN 50 AND 100 J/KG OVER THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...EXPECT THESE SCATTERED SHOWERS TO 
PRODUCE BRIEF SNOW SQUALLS OVER PORTIONS OF THE AREA...WHICH WILL BE 
ABLE TO GENERATE A QUICK INCH OR TWO OF SNOW. TEMPS IN THE LOWER 
ELEVATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN ABOVE FREEZING TODAY...SO THINK 
THAT MOST SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS SHOULD BE ON 
GRASSY SURFACES. WILL PLAN TO ADD A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR 
TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY OVER NORTHEAST TN AND THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...WHERE THE COVERAGE OF SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE BETTER AND THE 
SNOW WILL HAVE A BETTER CHANCE TO ACCUMULATE. FARTHER SOUTH ACROSS 
CENTRAL EAST TN AND SOUTHEAST TN...TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO RISE INTO 
THE 40S THIS AFTERNOON...SO THINK THAT ANY SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS IN 
THESE AREAS SHOULD BE AROUND AN INCH OR LESS. WILL NOT EXPAND ANY 
ADVISORIES OVER EXTREME SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC FOR TODAY... 
BUT AN ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED LATER FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE REVEALING DISCREPANCIES FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE COOLER NAM 
NUMBERS DUE TO THE STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A SECONDARY UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL PASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY...PROVIDING ENOUGH LIFT 
TO TRIGGER AN ADDITIONAL ROUND OF SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE REGION. 
THE MOST FAVORED AREAS FOR MORE MEASURABLE SNOWFALL AND APPRECIABLE 
ACCUMULATIONS WOULD BE ACROSS THE MOUNTAIN ZONES OF SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE WHERE TOTALS IN EXCESS OF 4 INCHES WILL 
BE POSSIBLE THANKS TO THE STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW...WHICH WILL ENHANCE 
THE POTENTIAL FOR OROGRAPHICALLY INDUCED SNOW SHOWERS TO PERSIST 
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN INTO THE EVENING AND NIGHTTIME HOURS BY 
TUESDAY EVENING. OTHER VALLEY LOCATIONS ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA...FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COULD 
SEE BETWEEN 1-2 INCHES OF ACCUMULATIONS AS WELL IN CERTAIN AREAS 
GIVEN THE MOISTURE IN PLACE AND THE COOLER TEMPERATURE PROFILES 
THERE. OTHER LOCATIONS ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY ARE 
NOT EXPECTED TO RECEIVE ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL...WITH TOTALS BEING 
VERY MINOR AND LESS THAN 1/2 AN INCH. BY WEDNESDAY MORNING...PRECIP 
CHANCES WILL DROP DRAMATICALLY AS THE STORM SYSTEM PULLS OFF TO THE 
EAST...YIELDING SOME DRIER BUT COOLER WEATHER WITH NORTHWEST WINDS 
REINFORCING THE DRY/COLD AIR MASS. HIGHS WILL REMAIN AROUND 10-15 
DEGREES BELOW NORMAL DURING THE MIDDLE PART OF THE WEEK BEFORE WINDS 
BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST ALLOWING FOR A BRIEF WARM UP LATE THIS WEEK. 
HOWEVER...THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST... 
BRINGING SOME LOW-END PRECIPITATION CHANCES INITIALLY FOR FRIDAY 
INTO SATURDAY...AND PERHAPS A BETTER SHOT HEADING INTO EASTER SUNDAY 
AND THE FIRST FULL WEEK OF APRIL.

LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKING NE FROM WRN KY THIS AFTERNOON WITH
CONVECTION DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. TSRA HAVE BEEN
PRODUCING 1/2 TO 3/4 INCH HAIL OVER MIDDLE TN...ALTHO INSTABILITY
MAY DIMINISH BY THE TIME THIS ACTIVITY REACHES OUR WRN COUNTIES.

WESTERLY WINDS KICK IN AND RAIN SHOWERS CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS
AFTER 06Z MONDAY...AS THE LOW TRACKS FURTHER NE. TRENDED CLOSE TO
PREVIOUS SNOW AMOUNTS IN THE WATCH AREA...WITH THE ADDITION OF
GENERALLY 1 TO 3 INCH AMOUNTS FOR OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES AND LOWER
ELEVATIONS OF NE TN BY TUESDAY. LAPSE RATES ARE QUITE STEEP ON
TUESDAY WITH LOW LEVEL CAPE NEAR 100 J/KG...SO ADDITIONAL SNOW
ACCUMS AT LEAST THROUGH DAYTIME TUESDAY.

WATCH AREA WAS UPGRADED TO A WINTER STORM WARNING. STRONG GRADIENT
IN PLACE BEHIND THE PASSING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...SO POSTED A WIND
ADVISORY FOR ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON.

HEAVY RAIN IN CHA AREA OVERNIGHT HAS SENT THE SOUTH CHICKAMAUGA

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED OVER SOUTHERN MS...WITH A WEAK 
INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING NORTHEAST OF IT INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL A LARGE AREA OF RAIN SPREADING NORTHEASTWARD OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS MORNING...WITH THE MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT A BRIEF LULL IN THIS RAINFALL ACTIVITY DEVELOPING BY LATE 
MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON. A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
IS THEN PROGGED TO SWING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...HELPING TO TRIGGER CONVECTION ALONG A 
COLD FRONT AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. A MARGINALLY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS WITH DECENT WIND SHEAR IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT BY LATE THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE FREEZING LEVEL 
DROPPING TO AROUND 6000 FT MSL. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT A LINE OF 
CONVECTION WILL LIKELY DEVELOP ALONG THIS COLD FRONT LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...WITH A FEW STORMS CAPABLE OF PRODUCING 
LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS. WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO BECOME GUSTY 
THIS AFTERNOON...AND ESPECIALLY TONIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT...BUT 
IT APPEARS THAT WIND SPEEDS WILL REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA 
UNTIL MONDAY. RAIN SHOULD QUICKLY CHANGE TO SNOW TONIGHT BEHIND THE 
PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT...WITH SNOWFALL STARTING TO ACCUMULATE 
MAINLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SINCE THE ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL 
SHOULD BEGIN LATE TONIGHT...WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER STORM WATCH AND 
WILL LET THE DAY SHIFT UPGRADE AS NECESSARY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...STRONG GRADIENT WINDS WILL 
CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY IN THE WAKE OF A COLD 
FRONTAL PASSAGE AND AS A STRONG 60+ KT 850 MB JET AND A SUBSEQUENT 
STRONG MID TO UPPER-LEVEL JET STRUCTURE ALL ROTATING OVER THE AREA. 
THIS IS EXPECTED TO RESULT IN SUSTAINED WINDS OF 20 TO 30 MPH WITH 
GUSTS UP TO 45 MPH. THUS...A WIND ADVISORY WILL ALMOST CERTAINLY BE 
NEEDED FOR MONDAY...WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF A HIGH WIND WARNING 
ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE LOCALLY HIGHER WINDS/GUSTS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE. 

THE OTHER STORY WILL BE THE COLDER AIR THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE 
REGION IN WAKE OF THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT. THIS COLDER AIR WILL 
COMBINE WITH SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE ON THE BACKSIDE OF A 
DEPARTING UPPER-LOW AND THE LIFT PROVIDED BY A APPROACHING SECONDARY 
WAVE TO GENERATE SCATTERED TO WIDESPREAD SHOWERS/SNOW SHOWERS MONDAY 
AND MONDAY NIGHT...AND INTO THE DAY ON TUESDAY. INCREASING THE 
SNOWFALL POTENTIAL IS A PROGGED STOUT NORTHWEST FLOW WHICH WILL HELP 
TO ENHANCE OROGRAPHIC LIFT ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE 
AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. WHILE MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL RECEIVE 
VERY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS OF LESS THAN HALF AN INCH...THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS SHOULD SEE A MODERATE TO PERHAPS LOCALLY HEAVY SNOWFALL 
GIVEN THE SETUP. THUS...HAVE GRIDS SHOWING LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL 
POPS OVER THE TERRAIN DURING THIS PERIOD AND AM EXPECTING THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SNOWFALL TOTALS IN EXCESS OF 4 INCHES IN THESE AREAS. 
THUS...A WINTER STORM WATCH IS IN EFFECT FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON. MOST AREAS 
IN THE LOWER-ELEVATIONS SHOULD SEE LOW-END ADVISORY LEVEL CRITERIA 
SNOWFALL OR LESS...WITH SEVERAL AREAS RECEIVING LESS THAN HALF AN 
INCH.

THEREAFTER...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL HELP TO KEEP THE COOLER AIR 
IN THE REGION FOR MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK WITH HIGHS 
REMAINING 10-15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL. THEN...WINDS BACK TO THE 
SOUTHWEST ALLOWING FOR AN ADDITIONAL WARM UP THE REST OF THE WEEK 
BEFORE THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM ROLLS IN FROM THE WEST...BRINGING SOME 
LOW-END PRECIPITATION THE WEEKEND.

FAR...BUT SEEING SHOWERS DEVELOP OVER N MS AND SW TN. TWEAKED POP
GRIDS DOWN A BIT FOR THE CURRENT AND EARLIEST EVENING GRIDS.
OTHERWISE...GRIDS WERE GENERALLY ON TRACK FOR TONIGHT AND SUNDAY.
SHOWERS WITH A GOOD CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS THOSE PERIODS...AND
CAN'T RULE OUT SOME HAIL ON SUNDAY DUE TO COLD POOL ALOFT AND LOW
FREEZING LEVEL. STRONG WINDS SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...WHICH MAY
REQUIRE A WIND ADVISORY.

MAIN CONCERNS ARE A PROLONGED PERIOD OF SNOW SHOWERS FOR SW VA...
NRN MTNS AND SMOKY MTNS RIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY DAYTIME. DEEP
MOISTURE...SYNOPTIC FORCING AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT AFTER FRONTAL
PASSAGE...ALL SUPPORT A WINTER STORM WATCH. KEPT SNOW AMOUNTS DONW

KEEP SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER. KEPT MOST OF THE AREA DRY ON WEDNESDAY BUT 
PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW AND SOME LINGERING MOISTURE MAY PROVIDE 
FOR A SLIGHT CHANCE THAT A SNOW SHOWER MAY OCCUR IN THE HIGHEST 
TERRAIN SW VA AND THE PEAKS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. WAS 
ABLE TO KEEP A DRY PERIOD GOING FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE 
DAYTIME PERIOD ON FRIDAY AS SURFACE RIDGE SLIDES EAST ACROSS THE 
REGION. FORECAST UNCERTAINTY BUILDS AT THE END OF THE EXTENDED WITH 
SOME DIVERGENCE OF OPINION BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND GFS. EDGED THE 
FORECAST A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE ECMWF ADDING A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A 
SHOWER FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT AS DEEPER MOISTURE MAKES 
AN ADVANCE ON THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ALONG WITH SOME WARM AIR 
ADVECTION/ISENTROPIC LIFT. HAD TO CUT BACK SIGNIFICANTLY ON 
SUGGESTED MEX MOS TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD 
DUE TO THE CONTINUATION OF A RATHER BLOCKED UP PATTERN. THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A WEAK 
INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING NORTHEAST OF IT INTO MIDDLE TN. THIS LOW 
PRESSURE AREA IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHEASTWARD AND DEEPEN 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS. A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WAS HELPING TO CREATE 
SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
MORNING...BUT MODELS AGREE THAT A LULL IN PRECIP ACTIVITY WILL 
DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE DEEPER MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
LOW SPREADS NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY OVER THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...SO WILL MENTION A 
CHANCE OF TSTORMS FOR THESE AREAS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY (MOST LIKELY 
DUE TO CLOUD COVER DIFFERENCES)...BUT ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR 
TONIGHT. WILL GENERALLY COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO WHERE DIFFERENCES 
ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM 
DROPPING SOUTH FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL BE THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THOUGH THE MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK. THIS 
STORM SYSTEM HAS THE POTENTIAL TO BRING STRONG WINDS TO THE 
REGION...ALONG WITH WELL-BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES FOR LATE MARCH 
AND GOOD PRECIPITATION CHANCES /INCLUDING THAT OF THE WINTRY VARIETY 
BEGINNING SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST THE DAY ON TUESDAY/.

A STRONG COLD FRONT AND ITS ASSOCIATED UPPER LOW WILL MOVE INTO THE 
OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEY ON SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT. AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT...STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL BE ENHANCED BY AN INTENSE 
LOW-LEVEL JET OF 60+ KT WINDS AT 850 MB AND A SUBSEQUENT STRONG MID 
TO UPPER-LEVEL JET STRUCTURE ALL ROTATING OVER THE AREA. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN SOME STRONG GUSTY WINDS ACROSS THE REGION BEGINNING SUNDAY 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND CONTINUING SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY IN WAKE 
OF THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS ACROSS THE VALLEYS AND 
FOOTHILLS SEEM PROBABLE ATTM...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME PERIODS 
OF HIGH WIND WARNING CRITERIA TO BE MET ALONG THE EAST TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS AS WELL. 

IN ADDITION TO THE STRONG WINDS...SOME GOOD PRECIPITATION CHANCES 
WILL EXIST GIVEN THE DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE AND THE STRONG LIFT 
ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM. SHOWERS AND SOME ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THE DAY ON SUNDAY. THEN...IN 
WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THE COOLER AIR FILTERING IN WILL CHANGE RAIN 
SHOWERS OVER TO A RAIN/SNOW MIX IN THE VALLEYS AND ALL SNOW IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. ADDITIONAL SNOW SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ON MONDAY AND ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY AS EVEN COLDER AIR FILTERS INTO THE REGION AND 
ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCE PASSES THROUGH THE REGION. GIVEN THE 
PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW...ADDITIONAL OROGRAPHICALLY ENHANCED SNOW 
SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE TUESDAY NIGHT AND PERHAPS INTO WEDNESDAY 
ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. 
THESE AREAS WILL LIKELY EXPERIENCE SOME MINOR TO MODERATE SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS GIVEN THE MOISTURE IN PLACE AND THE PREVAILING 
NORTHWEST FLOW ENHANCING OROGRAPHIC LIFT. LOWER ELEVATIONS /MAINLY 
ACROSS SW VIRGINIA AND NE TENNESSEE AND PERHAPS THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU/ COULD ALSO SEE SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS OF A DUSTING TO NO 
MORE THAN HALF AN INCH AS WELL. BY THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY CLEARING IS 
EXPECTED TO TAKE PLACE...RESULTING IN SOME WARMING AHEAD OF THE NEXT 
SYSTEM PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA SOMETIME EASTER WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...SKIES ARE NOW CLOUDY ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA
AT SUNSET THIS EVENING. ISENTROPIC LIFT IS PRODUCING SOME VIRGA OVER
THE REGION BUT THE AIR MASS IS STILL A LITTLE TOO DRY FOR RAIN TO
REACH THE GROUND. HAVE SLOWED PROGRESS OF THE RAIN DOWN EVEN MORE BY
LOWERING POPS SOME MORE THIS EVENING WITH MEASURABLE RAIN BECOMING
LIKELY MAINLY AROUND 6Z SOUTHEAST SECTIONS AND 9 TO 12Z NE. 
TEMPERATURES WILL NOT FALL MUCH MORE IN THE SE TO THE LOWER 40S
BUT SHOULD FALL INTO THE 30S NE. STILL LOOKS LIKE THERE MAY BE SOME
SNOW HIGHER ELEVATIONS NE TN AND SW VA LATE TONIGHT BUT SHOULD
QUICKLY CHANGE TO RAIN SATURDAY MORNING AS ATMOSPHERE WARMS.

&&

.AVIATION...WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL BUILD EAST WHILE SURFACE
LOW PRESSURE GRADUALLY DEEPENS WHILE SHIFTING EAST INTO THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SATURDAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES AHEAD OF THE
FEATURE DROPPING CEILINGS AS LIGHT SHOWERS DEVELOP AT THE
TERMINALS. CONDITIONS LOWER INTO THE MVFR RANGE FROM AROUND 09Z AT
CHA TO 10Z AT TYS. TRI MAY HOLD ONTO VFR CONDITIONS UNTIL ABOUT 12Z

326 PM EDT FRI MAR 22 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MOST RAIN THIS AFTERNOON
HAS REMAINED TO OUR SOUTH...BUT SHOULD GRADUALLY DEVELOP THIS
EVENING. MODELS HAVE SUCH GOOD AGREEMENT ON MOST MEASURABLE RAINS
OCCURRING OVER THE SRN 2/3RDS OF THE FORECAST AREA...THAT PREVIOUS
GRIDS WERE STILL ON TRACK. KEPT CATEGORICAL POPS SRN AREAS TO JUST
SLIGHT CHANCE OVER SW VA. MIN TEMPS SUPPORT MORE THAN JUST RAIN...
BUT WITH ONLY 0.01 INCH IN GRIDS FOR COLDER AREAS...THERE WAS NO
REASON TO HIGHLIGHT SNOW MUCH AT ALL. DEW POINT TEMPS STILL VERY
LOW...PLUS HIGHS HAVE STRUGGLED TODAY UNDER CLOUD COVER. THUS...
EVAPORATIVE COOLING COULD EASILY LOWER TEMPS TO GFS MOS MINS...
EVEN UNDER SO MUCH CLOUD COVER. 

THE ISENTROPIC LIFT SPREADS LIGHT RAIN ACROSS THE SRN APPALACHIANS
MAINLY DURING THE MORNING SATURDAY...THEN RAIN CHANCES DROP OFF.
THERE APPEARS TO BE A BREAK BEFORE THE STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM
PUSHES SHOWERS OUR WAY SATURDAY NIGHT. BEST LIFT AND INCREASED
INSTABILITY DUE TO COOLER AIR ALOFT ON SUNDAY...SO WE SHOULD
DEFINITELY SEE A FEW THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP BY THEN.

I GENERALLY FOLLOWED A MOS BLEND WHERE LARGER DIFFERENCES WERE
NOTED IN MAX TEMPS EACH DAY...BUT CLOSER TO MILDER NAM MOS MINS FOR
SATURDAY NIGHT.

SOME STRONG WINDS ON SUNDAY...BUT 12Z NAM HAS COME MORE IN LINE
WITH THE GFS TRACK OF THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...RESULTING IN A
WEAKER 850 MB LOW LEVEL JET. IT HAD LOOKED EARLIER LIKE A POTENTIAL
MTN WAVE PATTERN. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...BIG SLOW MOVING UPPER LOW 
MIGRATES EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT WHILE WRAPPED UP SURFACE LOW DRIVES NORTHEAST FROM KENTUCKY 
INTO WESTERN PENNSYLVANIA. MORE THAN ADEQUATE MOISTURE AND LIFT WITH 
THIS SYSTEM WILL RESULT IN SNOW SHOWER PRODUCTION MAINLY IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU NORTHEAST THROUGH SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AS WELL AS THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. A 
MIXTURE OF LIGHT RAIN AND LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE THE PREVAILING 
PRECIP TYPE IN THE GREAT VALLEY. UNFORTUNATELY THIS GENERAL PATTERN 
WILL CONTINUE THROUGH TUESDAY AS A TRAILING SHORT WAVE DROPS INTO 
THE BASE OF THE LONGWAVE TROUGH ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES 
GENERATING MORE SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS WITH A 
MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW IN THE VALLEY. PRECIPITATION SHUTS DOWN BY 
WEDNESDAY MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. THE ONLY SPOTS THAT MAY SEE A 
SNOW SHOWER ON WEDNESDAY WILL BE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AS UPSLOPE 
FLOW GRADUALLY WINDS DOWN. THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD 
SHOULD BE DRY BUT MODERATION IN TEMPERATURES WILL BE A SLOW GO WITH 
A PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW. HAD TO UNDERCUT GUIDANCE TEMPS BY 
SEVERAL DEGREES IN THIS BLOCKED COLD PATTERN.

SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY DRIFT SOUTHEASTWARD TODAY INTO THE LOWER 
MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED MOISTURE SPREADING EASTWARD 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. AS A RESULT...CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO 
INCREASE OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WITH LIGHT RAIN DEVELOPING 
OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
THEN SPREADING NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA 
TONIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A FAIRLY DRY BOUNDARY LAYER OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...SO THIS RAIN MAY INITIALLY TAKE A WHILE 
TO MOISTEN THE LOWER LEVELS AND MAKE ITS WAY TO THE GROUND. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL STORM SYSTEM 
DROPPING SOUTH FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND 
THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS WILL BE THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE WEEKEND THROUGH THE EARLY TO MIDDLE PART 
OF NEXT WEEK. THIS STORM SYSTEM WILL BRING GOOD PRECIPITATION 
CHANCES AND MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES TO THE REGION FOR LATE MARCH... 
PROLONGING THE ONSET OF SPRING ACROSS THE AREA FOR THE TIME BEING.

A COLD FRONT WILL DROP SOUTH OF THE AREA SATURDAY MORNING...BRINGING 
A SHORT BREAK IN APPRECIABLE PRECIPITATION CHANCES FOR THE AREA. BY 
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY THE AFOREMENTIONED STORM SYSTEM WILL 
BECOME STRONGLY NEGATIVELY TITLED AS AN INTENSE UPPER-JET ROTATES 
OVER THE AREA. THIS FEATURE WILL PRODUCE SOME STRONG LIFT AND 
GENERATE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA...PARTICULARLY ON 
SUNDAY/SUNDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE REGION. IN 
WAKE OF THE FRONT...EVEN COOLER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALCHIANS RESULTING IN A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW SHOWERS SUNDAY NIGHT 
IN MANY LOCATIONS. THE LOW WILL DEEPEN AS IT MOVES THROUGH THE OHIO 
VALLEY AND WILL BE SLOW TO MOVE EAST...ALLOWING FOR CONTINUED SHOWER 
ACTIVITY ON THE BACKSIDE OF THE LOW ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. GIVEN THE 
COLD AIR IN PLACE...SNOW WILL LIKELY BE THE DOMINANT PRECIPITATION 
TYPE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING BEFORE IT CHANCES BACK OVER 
TO RAIN ON TUESDAY AND TAPERS OFF BY TUESDAY EVENING. WHILE 
ACCUMULATIONS ARE HIGHLY UNCERTAIN ATTM...THE HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS 
WILL LIKELY SEE SOME MINOR TO MODERATE SNOWFALL GIVEN THE MOISTURE 
IN PLACE AND THE PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW ENHANCING OROGRAPHIC 
LIFT. LOWER ELEVATIONS /MAINLY ACROSS SW VIRGINIA AND NE TENNESSEE/ 
COULD ALSO SEE AT LEAST SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS AS WELL...SO THE 
PROGRESS OF THIS SYSTEM AND THE LATEST FORECAST TRENDS WILL 
CERTAINLY NEED TO BE MONITORED.

IN ADDITION TO THE WINTER WEATHER POTENTIAL...THE STRONG JET ENERGY 
WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM /WITH 850 MB WINDS AOA 60 KTS/ AND A STEEP 
PRESSURE GRADIENT WITH THE AFOREMENTIONED PASSING LOW WILL RESULT IN 
SOME STRONG GUSTY WINDS SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...AND PERHAPS INTO 
MONDAY. THE POTENTIAL FOR WIND ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS ACROSS MUCH/ALL 
OF THE AREA CERTAINLY SEEMS PLAUSIBLE...WITH HIGH WIND WARNING 
POTENTIAL ALONG THE SPINE OF THE MOUNTAINS DURING THIS TIMEFRAME.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...STEEP LAPSE RATES GENERATED A
FAIR AMOUNT OF CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER SW VA AND NE TN THIS AFTERNOON...
BUT THESE CLOUDS WILL BE DISSIPATING SHORTLY. ISENTROPIC LIFT GETS
UNDERWAY LATE TONIGHT OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY REGION...WITH CLOUDS
INCREASING IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS INTO OUR FORECAST AREA.
OPTED TO JUST ABOUT DROP ANY MENTION OF PRECIPITATION FOR TONIGHT.
GFS MOS MINS LOOKED QUITE REASONABLE AS WINDS DIMINISH AND SKIES
STAY MOSTLY CLEAR OVER NE HALF OF THE REGION. 

ISENTROPIC LIFT CONTINUES ON FRIDAY WITH LIGHT RAIN GRADUALLY
REACHING ALL BUT EXTREME NE TN AND SW VA...ALTHO I DID INCREASE
CLOUD COVER THERE WITH A MENTION OF SPRINKLES LATE. CARRIED A SMALL
AREA OF LIKELY POPS OVER THE SEQUATCHIE VALLEY AND EXTREME SRN TN
VALLEY BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THE CLOUDINESS SEEMS TO FAVOR THE
MUCH COOLER GFS MOS HIGHS OVER SE TN AND SW NC...WITH A MOS BLEND
IN THE FAR NE WHERE CLOUDS ARRIVE LATER.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...VERY ACTIVE EXTENDED. 
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING WILL PRODUCING AN AREA OF PRECIPITATION 
(MAINLY RAIN) OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND SATURDAY MORNING.

FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...A STRONG NEGATIVE TILTED UPPER 
TROUGH WILL MOVE FROM THE MID-SECTION OF THE NATION TOWARD THE OHIO 
VALLEY. STRONG UPPER JET STRUCTURE WILL PRODUCE LARGE SCALE LIFT 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE UPPER JET WILL ENHANCE THE 
FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG A FRONTAL PASSAGE SUNDAY. MODELS SHOW 
ENOUGH INSTABILITY AND SYNOPTIC FORCING TO INCLUDE A CHANCE OF 
THUNDERSTORMS FOR SUNDAY.

THE TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT AROUND DEEP CYCLOGENESIS WILL PRODUCE AN 
850MB LOW-LEVEL JET OF 50-60KTS AFTER FROPA. THESE WINDS WILL LIKELY 
MIX DOWN TO THE SURFACE ALONG WITH STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION TO 
PRODUCE WINDY CONDITIONS AREA-WIDE SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. THE 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL QUICKLY COOL THE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE 
COLUMN TO ALLOW THE PRECIPITATION TO CHANGE TO SNOW. 

FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY...UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE TERRAIN 
FEATURES ALONG WITH PERIODS OF LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY WILL PRODUCE 
SNOW SHOWERS OVER MOST OF THE AREA. ACCUMULATING SNOWS ARE LIKELY 
FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...FAR EASTERN 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND POSSIBLY THE NORTHER PLATEAU.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD HIGH PRESSURE DOMINATES
THE SURFACE WITH AN UPPER LOW OVER NE CANADA AND TROUGH EXTENDING
SW OVER THE GREAT LAKES. STILL REPORTING SOME LIGHT FLURRIES IN
WISE COUNTY THIS MORNING AS WEAK VORTICITY LOBE ROTATES THROUGH.
THIS MAY CONTINUE A FEW MORE HOURS BUT OVERALL SKIES EXPECTED TO
BECOME CLEAR IN THE TN MOUNTAINS AND ACROSS SW VA BY ABOUT 12Z OR
MID MORNING. N TO NW FLOW ALOFT BRINGS VERY COLD AIR MASS INTO THE
REGION TODAY. TEMPERATURES RIGHT NOW IN THE MID 20S TO LOWER 30S AT
THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AND TEENS TO LOWER 20S MOUNTAINS. HIGHS STAY
BELOW FREEZING MOUNTAINS AND MID 30S TO MID 40S ELSEWHERE EVEN WITH
SUNSHINE. WINDS AGAIN PICK UP FROM THE WEST 10 TO 20 MPH HOUR BUT
WITH COLDER TEMPERATURES RH VALUES WILL NOT BE AS LOW AS WEDNESDAY.
TONIGHT SKIES CONTINUE TO BE MOSTLY CLEAR EARLY BUT WEAK
ISENTROPIC LIFT IN THE SW IS ENOUGH TO INCREASE CLOUDS AND MOISTEN
ATMOSPHERE WITH SNOW FLURRIES OR LIGHT SNOW POSSIBLE LATE ACROSS SE
TN AND THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. WEAK LOW TO MID

FROM THE WEST FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. THE PRECIPITATION WILL FAVOR 
SW AREAS AND MAY BEGIN AS VERY LIGHT SNOW AND FLURRIES FRIDAY 
MORNING. INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH MOVES NE INTO THE AREA SATURDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...JUST STARTING TO SEE CLOUDS 
INCREASE OVER MOST OF KY AND NW PARTS OF MIDDLE TN AHEAD OF THE 
QUICK MOVING UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE. SEEING A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS 
DEVELOP AS WELL ON AREA RADARS...GENERALLY NORTH OF I-40 AND WEST OF 
I-65 IN THAT REGION. GFS QPF LOOKS TOO BROAD-BRUSHED AND ITS POPS 
TOO LOW. PREFER THE SOLUTION FROM NAM-RUC-WRF WHICH SUPPORTS A LIGHT 
QPF EVENT...MAINLY ALONG THE TN-NC LINE WHERE BEST LIFT IS FOCUSED 
THIS EVENING. THIS WILL BE A SHORT DURATION EVENT...LIKELY WINDING 
DOWN RAPIDLY AFTER 06Z THURSDAY. KEPT SNOW ACCUMS LIMITED TO HIGHER 
TERRAIN WITH LESS THAN 1 INCH IN GRIDS. INITIAL SHOWERS OCCUR WITH 
SURFACE TEMPS MUCH TOO WARM...THEN TEMPS DROP INTO THE 20S OVERNIGHT.

OPTED TO KEEP THE RED FLAG WARNING GOING FOR SW VA...AS W-NW WINDS 
SHOULD STAY GUSTY THROUGH THE EARLY EVENING HOURS AT LEAST. ALSO...
NOTICED SOME LOW RH VALUES WHERE DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE REMAINED IN 
THE 10 TO 20 DEGREE RANGE. HWO PRODUCT WAS UPDATED TO INCLUDE THE 
FIRE DANGER THREAT PLUS POSSIBLE PATCHY BLACK ICE OVERNIGHT WHERE 
SNOW SHOWERS ARE LIKELY. 

OTHERWISE...WINDS AND CLOUDS EARLY TONIGHT FAVOR MORE OF A MOS BLEND 
THAN THE COOLER GFS MOS MINS. SUNSHINE RETURNS ON THURSDAY...BUT 850 
MB TEMPS REMAIN QUITE COOL OVER NE HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
TWEAKED THE THURSDAY MAX TEMP GRID TO REFLECT THIS.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...BUSY WEATHER
PATTERN FOR THESE PERIODS...BUT NOT A LOT OF SYSTEMS...RATHER
JUST SIMPLY...WE ARE AT THE LATITUDE WHERE WE ARE CLOSE TO IF NOW
COMPLETELY WITHIN THE AREA OF LIFT FOR A COUPLE OF SYSTEMS. SYSTEM
TO SOUTH AT BEGINNING OF ALL THIS LOOKS LIKE IT WILL ONLY BE
FLURRIES AT BEST OVER THE SOUTHERN AREAS FRIDAY...THEN WARMER AIR
BUILD INTO THE AREA...MAKING THE PRECIP TYPE THROUGH THE REST OF
THE WEEKEND ALL LIQUID. FOR POPS...HAVE THE NORTHERN AREAS BELOW
GUIDANCE IN THE EARLIER PERIODS AS OTHER MODELS AND ENSEMBLES HINT
THAT MAIN PRECIP AREAS MAY BE FARTHER SOUTH. FOR LATER PERIODS...
COLD AIR COMES PLUNGING IN AGAIN FOR NEXT WEEK...WENT WELL BELOW

OVER THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PLAINS WAS SHIFTING SLOWLY SE INTO

VERY DRY. TEMPERATURES WERE STILL IN THE LOWER 30S TO MID 40S AT
THIS HOUR. AT THE SAME TIME AN UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES WAS
BRINGING A SHORTWAVE SE IN THE NW FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE MID
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THIS FEATURE WILL MOVE EAST INTO THE OHIO AND
TN VALLEYS THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT AND TRIGGER RAIN AND SNOW
SHOWERS BEFORE IT MOVES OUT EARLY THURSDAY. THESE SHOWERS WILL
AFFECT MAINLY THE TERRAIN AREAS OF SW VA AND NE TN WITH UP TO ABOUT
AN INCH OF SNOW OVERNIGHT. WINDS WILL PICK UP THIS AFTERNOON OUT OF

.LONG TERM....LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LITTLE
CHANGE TO ONGOING FORECAST.

COOL AND WET WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGH TUESDAY AS A CLOSED UPPER 
LOWS AFFECTS THE REGION THIS WEEKEND. A SURGE OF ABNORMALLY COLD AIR
WILL RESULT IN HIGH TEMPS ON THURSDAY ONLY IN THE 30S NORTH AND 40S 
SOUTH. 

CLOUDY AND WET PERIOD FOR THE WEEKEND.

MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THEIR GENERAL PRECIP 
DEPICTIONS FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BRING 
LIGHT SNOW INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA EARLY FRIDAY THAT 
SPREADS NORTHWARD AND CHANGES TO RAIN. LIFTING FREEZING LEVEL AND 
AVAILABLE MOISTURE COINCIDE NICELY TO FAVOR ONLY LIGHT SNOW THIS FAR 
NE. SHIFT IN MODEL SOLUTIONS COULD RAMP SNOW UP EARLY FRIDAY. 
SYNOPTIC LIFT STRENGTHENS...WARMING CONTINUES AND THE RAIN PERSISTS 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES NE THROUGH THE TN VALLEY 
ON SUNDAY.

COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH BY EARLY MONDAY. STRONG SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE AND COLD AIR MASS WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION AND PERSIST

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)... 
IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH THE REGION LAST
NIGHT...A SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE HAS BUILT INTO THE
AREA...PROMOTING CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON. A LOW-
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE GREAT LAKES HAS HELPED TO KEEP NORTHWEST
FLOW IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION AND REINFORCE THIS COOLER AND DRIER
POSTFRONTAL AIRMASS. HOWEVER...A SHORTWAVE ROTATING AROUND THE
AFOREMENTIONED LOW WILL DROP SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE LOWER OHIO
VALLEY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS LATE TONIGHT INTO
TOMORROW. THIS DISTURBANCE WILL INCREASE CLOUD COVER OVERNIGHT INTO
THE DAY TOMORROW AND PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT TO TRIGGER SOME ISOLATED
TO SCATTERED PRECIPITATION TOMORROW AFTERNOON AND EVENING. GIVEN
THE DRYNESS AT THE LOW-LEVELS AM NOT EXPECTING VERY MUCH IN THE WAY
OF ACCUMULATIONS. LOCATIONS ACROSS THE NORTHERN/NORTHEAST
ZONES...AND ALONG THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE THE MOST FAVORED AREAS FOR
PRECIPITATION. GIVEN THE COLDER AIR IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION BY
TOMORROW EVENING...RAIN SHOWERS WILL QUICKLY CHANGEOVER TO SNOW
SHOWERS AFTER SUNSET /WITH SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE ALONG
THE HIGHER TERRAIN/. AFTER MIDNIGHT...PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL
WANE AS THE DISTURBANCE TRACKS OFF TO THE SOUTHEAST.
 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
COOL AND WET WEATHER IS EXPECTED THROUGH TUESDAY AS A SERIES OF 
CLOSED UPPER LOWS CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE REGION. A SURGE OF 
ABNORMALLY COLD AIR BEHIND THE CLOSED LOW OVER NEW ENGLAND WILL 
RESULT IN HIGH TEMPS ON THURSDAY ONLY IN THE 30S NORTH AND 40S 
SOUTH. AT LEAST THURSDAY LOOKS DRY AND MOSTLY SUNNY BEFORE WE HEAD 
INTO A CLOUDY AND RAINY PERIOD FOR THE WEEKEND.

MODELS HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THEIR GENERAL PRECIP 
DEPICTIONS FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY. ISENTROPIC LIFT AND WARM 
ADVECTION ALOFT SPREAD RAIN INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON 
FRIDAY...SPREADING NORTHWARD THROUGH SATURDAY. FORCING THIS 
PERIOD LOOKS GENERALLY WEAK AND CONFINED TO THE LOW LEVELS BENEATH 
WEAK MID/UPPER LEVEL RIDGING...SO WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE 
RANGE. SYNOPTIC LIFT STRENGTHENS ON SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE CLOSED LOW 
TRACKS INTO THE PLAINS AND DIVERGENCE INCREASES AHEAD OF AN UPPER 
JET STREAK. ECMWF...GFS...GEFS MEAN...AND CANADIAN ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE POSITION OF THE LOW...AND ALL POINT TO SATURDAY 
NIGHT/SUNDAY PERIODS FOR THE GREATEST PRECIP CHANCES...SO WILL RAISE 
POPS INTO THE LIKELY RANGE. THUNDER COULD BE POSSIBLE THIS 
PERIOD...BUT THIS WILL DEPEND ON FINER DETAILS OF FRONTAL 
POSITIONS...WHICH ARE TOO UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME TO WARRANT ADDING A 
MENTION OF TS.

THE MODELS DIVERGE A BIT WITH THE TRACK OF THE UPPER LOW AFTER THIS 
POINT...WITH THE ECMWF BEING MORE PROGRESSIVE THAN THE GFS. IF THE 
GFS IS CORRECT...THE CLOSED LOW WILL SIT OVER THE GREAT 
LAKES/MID-ATLANTIC AND CONTINUE TO PUMP COLD ARCTIC AIR INTO OUR 
AREA. WILL KEEP A CHANCE POP NORTH FOR MONDAY...AND START TUESDAY 
DRY WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS.

IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT THAT MOVED THROUGH THE REGION LAST
NIGHT...A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS HAS FILTERED INTO THE REGION.
THIS PROMOTED RAPID CLEARING EVEN ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AFTER

COOLER TODAY AS BREEZY NORTHWEST WINDS INCREASE BY LATE MORNING
INTO THE AFTERNOON IN RESPONSE TO A DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL LOW

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT STRETCHING GENERALLY 
ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY MILD AIR MASS 
STILL LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS INDICATE THAT 
THE EARLIER CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WAS SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS EVENING...BUT A BROKEN LINE OF LIGHT SHOWERS WAS 
REDEVELOPING ALONG THE COLD FRONT OVER THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. MODELS INDICATE THAT ADDITIONAL SHOWERS WILL FORM ALONG THE 
COLD FRONT TONIGHT...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES SOME OVER 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING AND THE EARLIER 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY HAVE COMBINED TO PRODUCE A STABLE AIR MASS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...AND THINK THAT ANY ADDITIONAL 
SHOWER DEVELOPMENT ALONG THE COLD FRONT TONIGHT SHOULD BE SCATTERED. 
THUS...WILL PLAN TO LOWER POPS EVERYWHERE FOR TONIGHT...AND WILL 
REMOVE ANY MENTION OF THUNDER. OTHERWISE...THE REST OF THE FORECAST 
APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK AND WILL NOT CHANGE THIS EVENING.

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT AND TUESDAY/...
THIS AFTERNOON...SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD
THE AREA AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT THAT IS SLOWLY MOVING TOWARD THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.T HE REMNANTS OF A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS IS
CONTINUING TO HOLD TOGETHER ACROSS EASTERN MIDDLE TN AND NORTHERN
AL...AND WILL CONTINUE TO APPROACH THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY THE
LATE AFTERNOON. GIVEN SOME MODEST ELEVATED INSTABILITY ACROSS
SOUTHERN PLATEAU/SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...A COUPLE OF STORMS
COULD BECOME SEVERE...WITH DAMAGING WIND GUSTS BEING THE PRIMARY
THREAT. A WEAK WARM FRONT IS DRAPED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY
WHICH COMBINED WITH SOME DECENT LOW-LEVEL HELICITY VALUES AND LOW-
LEVEL WIND SHEAR COULD HELP PRODUCE A BRIEF TORNADO AS
WELL...THOUGH DAMAGING STRAIGHT LINE WINDS AND PERHAPS SOME SMALL
HAIL WILL BE THE PRIMARY THREATS. NORTH OF THIS BOUNDARY...THE
ATMOSPHERE IS MORE STABLE...AND THOUGH ELEVATED STORMS ARE EXPECTED
FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE AFTERNOON...THE OVERALL SEVERE THREAT IS
CERTAINLY DIMINISHED FURTHER NORTH.

WITH INSTABILITY DECREASING AFTER SUNSET...THE SEVERE THREAT WILL
DIMINISH AREAWIDE...BUT SHOWERS AND SOME ISOLATED STORMS WILL
CONTINUE INTO THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT HOURS AS STRONG LIFT AHEAD
OF THE FRONT WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE THIS ACTIVITY. THUS HAVE
GONE CATEGORICAL POPS AREAWIDE THROUGH 06Z...BEFORE DIMINISHING
THEM FROM WEST TO EAST BETWEEN 06Z TO 12Z AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES
THROUGH. SOME GUSTY WINDS /MAINLY GRADIENT IN NATURE/ WILL STILL BE
POSSIBLE ALONG/AHEAD OF THE FRONT OVERNIGHT GIVEN THE STRONG JET
DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM. BY TUESDAY MORNING...
CLEARING WILL OCCUR AND TEMPERATURES WILL BE LOWER AS COLDER AND
DRIER AIR FILTERS INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH ROTATES AROUND THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER THE
UPPER GREAT LAKES...WITH THE CHANNELED VORT MAX SKIRTING OUR
NORTHERN SECTIONS WEDNESDAY. THOUGH MOISTURE IS LIMITED...COOL
MIDLEVEL TEMPS SHOULD PRODUCE SOME INSTABILITY FOR ISOLATED TO
SCATTERED SHOWERS IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. A DEEP NW FLOW
BEHIND THE TROUGH BRINGS COLDER AIR IN WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
THURSDAY...WITH TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL.

POSITIVE THETA-E ADVECTION WILL RETURN TO THE AREA ON FRIDAY AS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER TX/OK. THE ECMWF AND GFS HAVE SOME 
TIMING AND POSITION DIFFERENCES WITH THIS SYSTEM...WITH THE ECMWF 
BEING THE FASTER OF THE TWO AND FARTHER SOUTH WITH THE 850 MB LOW 
PLACEMENT. NEITHER MODEL HAS STRONG SYNOPTIC FORCING AS THE 
MID/UPPER FLOW IS SOMEWHAT ZONAL UNTIL SUNDAY...SO CONFIDENCE IS 
LOW. BOTH MODELS HAVE SOME TIMING OVERLAP WITH THEIR PRECIP 
DEPICTIONS FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY...AND THIS IS THE TIME PERIOD OF 
GREATEST GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN PRECIP AS WELL...SO WILL RAISE POPS A BIT 
IN THESE PERIODS TO A HIGH CHANCE. MODEL DISPARITIES PREVENT LIKELY 
POPS AT THIS TIME. LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS CONTINUE IN NORTHERN 
AREAS THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY. WILL START MONDAY DRY AS SHOWN BY THE GFS...WITH BELOW 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...
THE THREAT FOR THUNDERSTORMS /SOME BECOMING STRONG TO SEVERE/ WILL
INCREASE OVER THE COURSE OF THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS A
DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS PUSHES A
STRONG COLD FRONT TOWARD THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON. AHEAD OF THE
ACTUAL FRONT...A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS HAS DEVELOPED ACROSS
SOUTHERN KENTUCKY AND MIDDLE TENNESSEE. THIS LINE WILL CONTINUE
TRACKING EASTWARD AND WILL APPROACH OUR CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES
BY EARLY TO MID AFTERNOON /WHERE A SEVERE THUNDERSTORM WATCH IS
ALREADY IN EFFECT/. A STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET COUPLED WITH A STRONG
MID-LEVEL JET TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AREA IS PROVIDING SOME STRONG
BULK SHEAR VALUES...ALLOWING FOR GOOD STORM ORGANIZATION. OF
CONCERN FOR OUR AREA...ELEVATED INSTABILITY VALUES ACROSS THE WARM
SECTOR /PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE EAST
TENNESSEE/ WILL ALLOW THIS LINE OF STORMS TO MAINTAIN
ITSELF/STRENGTHEN AS IT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. GIVEN THE
STRONG DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM...THE PRIMARY THREAT OF SEVERE
WEATHER WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS. LOW-LEVEL SHEAR WILL BE SOMEWHAT
STRONG BUT IS MORE UNIDIRECTIONAL IN NATURE BY THE AFTERNOON.
STILL...AN ISOLATED BRIEF TORNADO CANNOT BE RULED OUT GIVEN THE
STRENGTH OF THE LOW-LEVEL WINDS AND LOW-LEVEL HELICITY VALUES
PROGGED TO BE AOA 200-400 M2/S2 BY THE AFTERNOON. THUS HAVE
HIGHLIGHTED THIS THREAT IN THE HWO AS WELL.

AHEAD OF THE MAIN LINE...THE STRONG LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORM
SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO TRIGGER SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ELEVATED
STORMS ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST NC...AND EVENTUALLY INTO
NORTHEAST TN/SOUTHWEST VA AS THE WARM FRONT GRADUALLY PUSHES
TO THE NORTH AND EAST LATER TODAY. BREEZY GRADIENT SOUTHERLY TO
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL ALLOW FOR GOOD WARMING TODAY INTO THE MID
TO UPPER 60S AREAWIDE...EXCEPT FOR THE FAR NORTHEAST ZONES WHICH
MAY BE JUST NORTH OF THE WARM FRONT.

.AVIATION...IT LOOKS LIKE THERE SHOULD BE QUITE A FEW HOURS OF VFR
FLYING WEATHER PRIOR TO DETERIORATION WHICH DEVELOPS LATER TONIGHT
AROUND CHA WITH SOME NEAR MVFR CEILINGS FORMING. THE PATTERN LOOKS
LIKE A DOWNSLOPE LOW LEVEL COMPONENT WOULD KEEP TYS AND TRI OUT OF
THE MAIN ACTION UNTIL ABOUT 17-18Z AS DEEPER MOISTURE ADVECTION AND
LIFT ADVANCE EAST FROM THE OZARKS. CHA WOULD LIKELY BECOME INVOLVED
A LITTLE EARLIER IN THE DAY. NOTICED THE MODELS INDICATE A BREAK IN
THE ACTIVE WEATHER FOR A PERIOD LATER MONDAY AFTERNOON FOLLOWING
THE DEPARTURE OF THE MIDWEST SHORT WAVE. THEREFORE REPLACED THE
PREVAILING SHRA/TSRA AT CHA AND TYS WITH VICINITY SHRA WHILE AWAITING
THE SURFACE COLD FRONT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER 
NORTHEAST TN WILL LIFT SLOWLY NORTH AS A WARM FRONT TONIGHT...THEN A 
A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH IN FROM THE WEST LATE MONDAY.  WILL CARRY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS NORTH TONIGHT IN VICINITY OF WARM FRONT. 
OTHERWISE JUST SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS LATE MOST ZONES WITH CHANCE 
OVER THE PLATEAU AS PRECIP APPROACHES AHEAD OF THE FRONT.  WILL 
CARRY CAT POPS ALL ZONES MONDAY.  INSTABILITY LOOKS FAIRLY LIMITED 
BUT ENOUGH FOR THUNDER TO BE CARRIED ALL ZONES.  ALSO...STILL 
APPEARS THERE WILL BE SOME SEVERE THREAT GIVEN SIGNIFICANT LOW LEVEL 
WIND FIELDS...MAINLY SOUTHWESTERN TWO THIRDS.  WILL MENTION IN 
HWO...WITH DAMAGING WINDS THE PRIMARY THREAT.  WILL TWEAK SOME MAV 
TEMPS UP A BIT FOR TONIGHT...BUT NOT MUCH ARGUMENT WITH HIGHS FOR 
MONDAY.      


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... A COLD FRONT WILL
CONTINUE TO PROGRESS EASTWARD INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION MONDAY EVENING AND NIGHT. DEPENDING ON
THE TIMING...THERE COULD SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY TO WORK WITH
OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND EAST TENNESSEE VALLEY TO SUPPORT
STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS THROUGH MID TO LATE EVENING. GIVEN THE
STRONG DYNAMICS WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM...DAMAGING WIND GUSTS WILL
BE THE PRIMARY THREAT WITH THESE STORMS. DEPENDING ON THE TIMING OF
THE FRONT...SHOWERS AND STORMS COULD CONTINUE ACROSS MUCH OF THE
AREA FOR MOST OF THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD GIVEN THE STRONG FORCING
AHEAD OF THE FRONT THAT WILL BE LIFTING INTO NORTHEAST TN AND
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AFTER SUNSET. HOWEVER...BY 12Z TUESDAY MOST OF
THE ACTIVITY SHOULD BE EAST OF THE AREA...WITH CLEARING OCCURRING
BY THE AFTERNOON IN WAKE OF THE FRONT.

COOLER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK AS 
CONTINUED NORTHWEST FLOW PREVAILS AND A SERIES OF DISTURBANCES MOVE 
ACROSS THE REGION. A CLIPPER SYSTEM ON WEDNESDAY COULD BEING SOME 
CLOUDS AND SLIGHT CHANCES FOR RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES...BUT 
THE PRIMARY SYSTEM OF CONCERN WILL BE MOVING IN THURSDAY/THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...PROVIDING CONTINUED CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK AND WEEKEND. THERE IS STILL 
QUITE A BIT OF MODEL SPREAD REGARDING THE TIMING...TRACK AND THE 
RESULTING PRECIPITATION ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM SO HAVE NOT GONE 
TERRIBLY HIGH WITH POPS YET ATTM. STILL...THINK CHANCE POPS ARE 
WARRANTED THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT LEAST SATURDAY NIGHT. WITH SOME 
COLDER AIR IN PLACE...SOME SNOW WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE DURING 
THE OVERNIGHT HOURS...MAINLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND NORTHEAST 
ZONES. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS PART OF THE 
FORECAST...WILL NOT GET TOO SPECIFIC FOR NOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY REMAIN DRAPED 
ACROSS THE AREA NEAR THE NORTHERN TN BORDER. SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE 
THIS MORNING ALONG AND NORTH OF THE BOUNDARY WITH ZONAL FLOW ALOFT 
AND WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT ALONG FRONT. MOST MODELS APPEAR TOO 
AGGRESSIVE WITH CLOUDS AND PCPN ACROSS CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS 
TODAY AND LEANED TOWARD A DRIER SOLUTION. THIS LEADS TO GOING TOWARD 
THE HIGH END OF MOS TEMP GUIDANCE WHICH HAS BEEN THE TREND WITH THIS 
CURRENT SCENARIO. FRONT MOVES NORTHWARD TODAY BUT HANDS ACROSS NE 
AREAS WHERE BETTER PCPN CHANCE LINGERS INTO THE AFTERNOON. SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE MOVES NE INTO W TN TONIGHT. UPPER JET INCREASES ACROSS 
MIDDLE TN AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WILL AID IN CONVECTION THAT WILL 
MOVE TOWARD THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU LATE TONIGHT.
 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MAIN WEATHER FEATURE THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED WITH BE A STRONG COLD FRONT TRACKING ACROSS THE AREA 
MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT.  A STRONG WIND FIELD COUPLED WITH WEAK TO 
MODERATE INSTABILITY WILL ALLOW FOR A LINE OF THUNDERSTORMS TO 
DEVELOP AND MOVE THROUGH THE AREA.  THERE REMAINS SOME POTENTIAL FOR 
SOME OF THE STORMS TO BECOME QUITE STRONG AND EVEN SEVERE.  
INSTABILITY DROPS OF QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET...BUT MAY SEE ANOTHER LINE 
OF SHOWERS AND A FEW THUNDERSTORM MOVING THROUGH OVERNIGHT.  BEHIND 
THE FRONT...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN WITH COOLER...DRIER AIR MOVING 
IN.  FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE ZONAL BY THE END OF THE PERIOD AS WE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED COLD 
FRONT OVER KENTUCKY...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL A FEW SCATTERED LIGHT 
SHOWERS LINGERING OVER NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA THIS EVENING... 
WITH THE LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING HELPING TO STABILIZE THE LOCAL AIR 
MASS WHICH WAS RESULTING IN THIS WEAKENING CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY. THE 
COLD FRONT OVER KENTUCKY IS EXPECTED TO SLOWLY MOVE SOUTHWARD 
TONIGHT...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE LATER TONIGHT POSSIBLY 
TRIGGER ADDITIONAL SHOWERS TOWARDS SUNRISE.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT 
WILL UPDATE THIS EVENING TO LOWER POPS A LITTLE OVER SOUTHWEST VA 
AND NORTHEAST TN...AND TO REMOVE ANY EVENING WORDING.

.AVIATION...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WITH A RATHER INTENSE TEMPERATURE
GRADIENT LIES NORTHWEST OF THE TERMINALS THIS EVENING...HAVING
MADE PROGRESS ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER DURING THE DAY. THE TAIL END OF
AN AREA OF SHOWERS THAT HAD DEVELOPED AHEAD OF THE SURFACE FRONT
WAS WORKING EAST OF TRI EARLY THIS EVENING. WITH LOSS OF INSOLATION
BELIEVE TRI MAY STAY DRY THROUGH MUCH OF THE NIGHT DESPITE THE
BOUNDARY SLIPPING STEADILY SOUTH. EXPECT THE BOUNDARY TO CONTINUE
TO A POSITION BETWEEN TRI AND TYS LATER TONIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING.
ANOTHER WAVE MOVES ALONG THE BOUNDARY EARLY ON SUNDAY AND MAY SPARK
ANOTHER SHOWER AROUND TRI AS THIS FEATURES SHIFTS EAST. ADDED A
VICINITY SHOWER TO THE MIX HERE MAINLY DURING THE MORNING FOR THIS
POSSIBILITY. NOT SURE IF TYS MAY SEE A SHOWER AS THE SHORT WAVE
MOVES TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BUT PROBABILITY LOOKS A
LITTLE TOO LOW TO MENTION HERE. CEILING WILL HOLD AROUND 4-6
THOUSAND FEET AT THE TERMINALS WITH THE BOUNDARY IN THE AREA. THE
TROUBLE SPOT WILL BE AT TRI WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF AN MVFR CEILING
FORMING TOWARD DAYBREAK AS THE LOWER LEVELS SATURATE BEHIND THE
STRONG COLD FRONT. SOME FOG MAY ALSO DEVELOP DURING THIS PERIOD
BEFORE DISSIPATING WITH IMPROVING CEILINGS AROUND 13-14Z.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL SAG SOUTH 
INTO THE NORTHERN PORTION OF THE AREA.  EXACTLY HOW FAR SOUTH IT 
WILL MAKE IT BEFORE STALLING TONIGHT IS STILL PROBLEMATIC...BUT IT 
APPEARS IT WILL HAVE A HARD TIME MAKING IT AS FAR SOUTH AS I-40. 
EXPECT THE FRONT BEGIN MOVING BACK NORTH AS A WARM FRONT ON SUNDAY.  
INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK SO NO THUNDER MENTION...BUT WILL CARRY HIGH 
CHANCE POPS NORTH TO SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH TONIGHT AND LOW LIKELY FAR 
NORTH TO LOW CHANCE CENTRAL SUNDAY.  EXPECT SOUTH ZONES TO BE PRECIP 
FREE SUNDAY. WINDS WILL BE SUBSIDING LATE THIS AFTERNOON INTO THIS
EVENING AND THINK THEY WILL BE BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA...SO WILL
CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORY IN THE MOUNTAINS A FEW HOURS EARLY. WILL
TWEAK SOME MAV TEMPS UP A BIT MAINLY SOUTH...BUT NO MAJOR
DEPARTURES.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WARM FRONT WILL
LIFT NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT INTO SOUTHERN KENTUCKY...HELPING TO
DECREASE CLOUD COVER AND RAIN CHANCES SOMEWHAT FOR THE OVERNIGHT
PERIOD. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE FRONT TO OUR
NORTHERN ZONES...SOME CHANCES FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL CERTAINLY
EXIST SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH SOME LOWER SLIGHT CHANCE POPS EXISTING
ROUGHLY SOUTH OF THE I-40 CORRIDOR.

ATTENTION WILL THEN TURN TO MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AS CONFIDENCE IS 
INCREASING THAT MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWER AND THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY 
WILL IMPACT THE AREA AS A DEEP NEGATIVELY TILTED UPPER LOW OVER THE 
MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY PUSHES A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA. AHEAD OF THE FRONT...INCREASING MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL TRIGGER 
SHOWERS AND SOME THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE MORNING HOURS. THEN BY THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING ...A GREATER AMOUNT OF INSTABILITY MAY BE IN 
PLAY...ALONG WITH SOME STRONG DYNAMICS THANKS TO A LOW TO MID LEVEL 
JET DISPLACED TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE AREA. THIS COULD TRIGGER A 
LINE OF STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MOVING FROM MIDDLE TENNESSEE 
INTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND EAST TENNESSEE VALLEY DURING THE 
LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING ALONG THE COLD FRONT. WHILE THE AMOUNT OF 
INSTABILITY IS STILL IN QUESTION...GFS SOUNDINGS AT KCHA AND TO A 
LESSER EXTENT KTYS SHOW SOME MODERATE ELEVATED INSTABILITY VALUES 
FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. THE NAM IS LITTLE MORE PESSIMISTIC...THOUGH 
IT STILL SHOWS SOME MODEST VALUES ALOFT AS WELL. GIVEN THE STRONG 
DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM...STORMS THAT DO FORM 
WILL CERTAINLY HAVE THE POTENTIAL TO BECOME ORGANIZED AND STRONG TO 
SEVERE...PARTICULARLY IF THE ATMOSPHERE IS ABLE TO DESTABILIZE MORE. 
THUS...A THREAT FOR PRIMARILY DAMAGING WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE MONDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...MAINLY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND EAST 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. INSTABILITY VALUES DROP OFF QUICKLY AFTER 
SUNSET...AND ARE MUCH LOWER ACROSS NORTHEAST TN/SOUTHWEST VA.  

BY TUESDAY MORNING...THE FRONT WILL HAVE CLEARED THE AREA AND 
OVERALL QUIET AND DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED FOR THE MIDDLE OF THE 
WEEK. DESPITE THE SUNSHINE...TEMPERATURES WILL STILL BE A LITTLE ON 
THE COOL SIDE FOR THIS TIME PERIOD GIVEN THE NORTHWEST FLOW 
REINFORCING A COOLER POST-FRONTAL AIR MASS. BY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY ANOTHER DISTURBANCE LOOKS TO MOVE INTO THE AREA...BRINGING 
THE REGION SOME DECENT CHANCES FOR RAIN TO CLOSE OUT THE WORK 
WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL SAG SOUTH 
TOWARD THE AREA.  HOW FAR SOUTH IT WILL MAKE IT DURING THE PERIOD IS 
STILL AN AREA OF UNCERTAINTY.  GFS A BIT MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE 
SOUTHWARD PUSH...BUT THINK THE NAM POSITION LOOKS BETTER WITH THE 
FRONT IN THE TRI-CITIES AREA BY LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON.  WILL SEE 
SOME SHOWERS ESPECIALLY NEAR THE FRONT. INSTABILITY LOOKS 
UNIMPRESSIVE SATURDAY...BUT STILL ENOUGH TO WARRANT A MENTION OF 
THUNDER.  WILL CARRY HIGHEST POPS NORTH...AND MENTION SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF THUNDER ALL ZONES SATURDAY.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE 
OVERALL...SO JUST A FEW MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.   

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... A FRONT WILL DROP
SOUTH OUT OF SOUTHERN KENTUCKY AND TRIGGER OFF SOME SHOWERS OVER
THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT AND INTO THE DAY ON SUNDAY...BEFORE IT
RETREATS BACK NORTH SUNDAY NIGHT. THE POTENTIAL FOR SCATTERED
SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE INTO MONDAY MORNING...BUT CONFIDENCE IS
INCREASING FOR EVEN MORE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND ESPECIALLY
THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. A DEEPENING UPPER-LOW
WILL MOVE INTO THE MID-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON MONDAY AND BECOME
NEGATIVELY TILTED THIS WILL DRIVE A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE OHIO AND
TENNESSEE VALLEYS BY MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING AND INTO THE SOUTHERN
APPALCHIANS THAT EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. WITH ABUNDANT GULF MOISTURE
IN PLACE...A STRONG LOW TO MID LEVEL JET TO THE NORTHWEST OF THE
AREA...AND LOW TO MODERATE INSTABILITY VALUES IN PLACE ACROSS THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND ACROSS THE EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY...THE
POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL CERTAINLY EXIST ALONG/AHEAD
OF THE FRONT MONDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE STRONG DYNAMICS WITH
THIS SYSTEM SUGGEST A DAMAGING WIND THREAT FROM A LINE OF STORMS
ADVANCING FROM THE WEST...BUT GFS MODEL SOUNDINGS AT KCHA AND EVEN
KTYS INDICATE THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME SUPERCELL STRUCTURES AS WELL.
THUS WILL MAKE A MENTION OF THIS SEVERE POTENTIAL IN THE HWO. THE
BEST CHANCE FOR SEVERE WEATHER WILL BE THE AFTERNOON AND EARLY
EVENING AS INSTABILITY VALUES DROP OFF QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET...AND
ARE MUCH LOWER ACROSS NORTHEAST TN/SOUTHWEST VA.

ONCE THE FRONT EXITS THE AREA BY TUESDAY MORNING...SOME CLEARING AND 
DRIER WEATHER CAN BE EXPECTED AS AN UPPER RIDGE AXIS BUILDS IN. SOME 
COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO BE ON THE HORIZON FOR THE MIDDLE OF 
NEXT WEEK GIVEN THE NORTHWEST FLOW/POST-FRONTAL AIR MASS IN PLACE. 
BY LATE WEEK...ANOTHER DISTURBANCE WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST INTO THE MID 
TO LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...GIVING THE AREA ANOTHER SHOT OF 
PRECIPITATION TO CLOSE OUT THE WORK WEEK.

AS LOW PRESSURE MOVES EAST ALONG FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY. SOUTHWEST WINDS AND WARM AIR ADVECTION BEGIN TODAY AND

PRODUCED NOT MUCH MORE THAN SPRINKLES AT NASHVILLE TN AND BOWLING

SPRINKLES/FLURRIES MENTIONED ELSEWHERE TONIGHT. WARMER AIR WILL BE

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... A FRONT WILL
GRADUALLY DROP SOUTHWARD THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND INTO SOUTHERN
KENTUCKY FRIDAY NIGHT...AND IS PROGGED TO STALL OUT JUST NORTH OF
THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY. THIS FRONT WILL BE THE FOCUS FOR
PRECIPITATION THIS WEEKEND AS A SERIES OF UPPER-LEVEL DISTURBANCES
PASS BY. ATTM...THERE IS A BIT OF QUESTION REGARDING PRECIP CHANCES
GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY ON HOW FAR SOUTH THE FRONT WILL GO.
HOWEVER...MUCH HIGHER CHANCES APPEAR MORE PROBABLE ACROSS THE
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT DUE
IT BEING CLOSER TO THE AFOREMENTIONED BOUNDARY. THE NAM /ALONG WITH
THE ECMWF/ SHOW THIS BOUNDARY FURTHER NORTH THAN THE GFS.
HOWEVER... THIS FRONT WILL GRADUALLY MOVE SOUTHWARD ON SUNDAY
INCREASING RAIN CHANCES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ZONES AS WELL AS
ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS THE REGION. A STRONG UPPER
TROUGH MOVING FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES WILL
THEN BECOME NEGATIVELY TILTED ON MONDAY AS IT TRACKS EAST...PUSHING
A STRONG COLD FRONT TOWARD THE AREA MONDAY INTO MONDAY NIGHT. GIVEN
THE HIGH GULF MOISTURE IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION...ALONG WITH SOME
INSTABILITY TO WORK WITH AND SOME GOOD DYNAMICS...SOME
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE PROBABLE ALONG/AHEAD OF THE FRONT. IN WAKE OF
THE FRONT SOME COOLER AND DRIER WEATHER WILL ENSUE FOR THE MIDDLE
OF THE WEEK AS SOME UPPER-RIDGING MOVES IN...BEFORE THE NEXT
DISTURBANCE MAY BRING SOME ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES WEDNESDAY NIGHT
INTO THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW CLOUDS SHOULD LARGELY 
DISSIPATE ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE EARLY IN 
THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH SUNSHINE EXPECTED FOR MUCH OF THE AREA 
THROUGH THE MORNING. SOME CI AND AC WILL BE ON THE INCREASE DURING 
THE AFTERNOON AS YET ANOTHER WEAK SHORT WAVE SHIFTS SOUTHEAST ACROSS 
THE MIDWEST...AND EVENTUALLY...OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS TONIGHT. LOOKS LIKE ANOTHER SYSTEM LACKING SIGNIFICANT 
LIFT AND DEFINITELY LACKING MOISTURE SO KEPT POPS QUITE LOW. 
TEMPERATURE PROFILE TONIGHT ALLOWS FOR A FEW SPRINKLES OR A COUPLE 
LIGHT RAIN DROPS IN SPOTS MAINLY NORTH OF I-40. AS THE LOW LEVELS 
COOL...WILL PROBABLY SEE A FEW SNOW FLURRIES. THE BEST CHANCE OF 
PRECIP...AND THAT CHANCE IS LOW...WILL BE OVER THE NORTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...EXTREME NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. PRECIP 
WOULD MOST LIKELY BE A MIXTURE OF LIGHT RAIN DROPS AND FLURRIES IN 
THE LOWER ELEVATIONS WITH LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
IT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE THERE WILL BE ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR 
ACCUMULATIONS MUCH ABOVE HALF AN INCH EVEN IN THE HIGHER MOUNTAIN 
ELEVATIONS. TRIED TO STICK CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS TEMP GUIDANCE FOR 
THIS PART OF THE FORECAST.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A DEEP NW FLOW OF DRY AIR 
THROUGH THE COLUMN WILL PROVIDE A DRY DAY ON FRIDAY BEFORE WE HEAD 
INTO A PROLONGED WET PERIOD. A FRONT SLOWLY PUSHES SOUTHWARD TOWARD 
THE AREA FRIDAY NIGHT...STALLING NEARBY ON SATURDAY AS IT BECOMES 
PARALLEL TO THE ZONAL UPPER FLOW. THIS BOUNDARY WILL SERVE AS A 
FOCUS FOR PRECIP THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS A SERIES UPPER LEVEL 
DISTURBANCES DRIFT BY. PRECIP CHANCES AND AMOUNTS WILL DEPEND ON THE 
POSITION OF THE FRONT...WHICH IS HIGHLY UNCERTAIN AT THIS TIME. THE 
ECMWF AND MOST ENSEMBLE MEMBERS PLACE THE PRECIP FARTHER NORTH THAN 
THE GFS. HOWEVER THE CONSENSUS BETWEEN THE GFS/ECMWF/GFS ENSEMBLE 
MEAN IS THAT THE BEST RAIN CHANCES WILL BE ON SUNDAY WITH A WEAK 
UPPER TROUGH PASSAGE...THEN AGAIN ON MONDAY NIGHT AS THE FLOW ALOFT 
BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED AND A COLD FRONT PUSHES THROUGH. WILL HAVE 
LIKELY POPS IN THESE TWO PERIODS...WITH CHANCE POPS BETWEEN. COLDER 
AND DRIER AIR WILL BUILD IN ON TUESDAY BEHIND THE FRONT AND UPPER 
TROUGH...WITH A RIDGE BUILDING IN ON WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES A BIT AS 
IT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION TODAY. COLD AIR ADVECTION STRENGTHENS 
INTO THE AFTERNOON WITH LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES TOPPING OUT AROUND 8-9 
DEGREES C/KM. TEMPERATURE PROFILE ARGUES FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN WITH FLURRIES/SPRINKLES ACROSS VALLEY 
LOCALES MAINLY ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS 
WELL AS THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA. THE PROBLEM IS THE 
SYSTEM WILL BE MOISTURE STARVED SO KEPT PROBABILITIES LOW WITH SOME 
ENHANCEMENT IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN WHERE OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL AID THE 
FORMATION OF SNOW SHOWERS DURING THE DAY TODAY AND OVERNIGHT AS SOME 
TRAILING MOISTURE AND SHORTWAVE LIFT DROP INTO THE REGION ON THE 
BACK SIDE OF THE DEPARTING LONGWAVE TROUGH. MIXING SHOULD BRING THE 
FAST WESTERLY FLOW TO THE SURFACE TODAY RESULTING IN A RATHER BREEZY 
DAY TODAY. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH EMBEDDED 
IN THE NW FLOW WILL CROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THURSDAY 
NIGHT. MOISTURE IS LIMITED...BUT THE GFS CRANKS OUT A COUPLE TENTHS 
OF QPF DOWN TO KNOXVILLE. THIS SEEMS OVERDONE...AND WILL LEAN MORE 
TOWARD THE SREF...WHICH HAS LESS THAN AN TENTH IN NORTHERN AREAS. 
FRIDAY LOOKS DRY AND WARMER AS THE FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE ZONAL. 

THE GFS AND ECMWF BRING A FRONT INTO THE AREA ON SATURDAY...WHICH 
STALLS DUE TO THE ZONAL FLOW ALOFT BEING PARALLEL TO THE E-W 
ORIENTED FRONT. THIS RESULTS IN A WET PERIOD WITH CHANCE POPS FROM 
SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. A FEW WEAK DISTURBANCES MOVING 
THROUGH THE ZONAL FLOW MAY ENHANCE RAIN CHANCES ON SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE IN THE DETAILS OF THIS PATTERN IS LOW. 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES WILL NOT BE MADE FROM THE PREVIOUS 
FORECAST...WITH POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE EACH DAY. WILL HAVE TEMPS 
ON THE COOL SIDE OF MOS DUE TO EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP. AN 
UPPER TROUGH PUSHES A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY 
NIGHT...WITH DRIER AIR FOLLOWING FOR TUESDAY.

A CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL TRACK ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND NEW

TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING. THE RESULTING STEEP LAPSE RATES WILL 
HELP GENERATE SOME SCATTERED TO ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS...WITH A 25-30

.DISCUSSION...
THIS EVENING...A COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO TRACK EASTWARD ACROSS THE
REGION. IN ITS WAKE...DRIER AND COOLER HAS BEGUN TO FILTER INTO THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND WILL EVENTUALLY SPREAD INTO THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER TONIGHT. AHEAD OF THE
FRONT...A BROAD AREA OF LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN WILL CONTINUE TO
PUSH OUT OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE BY LATE
THIS EVENING...THOUGH A SECONDARY AREA OF SHOWERS HAS FORMED ALONG
THE ACTUAL FRONT ITSELF AND WILL CONTINUE TO TRACK ALONG AND EAST
OF THE I-75 CORRIDOR THOUGH MIDNIGHT OR SO. GIVEN THE PROGRESSIVE
MOVEMENT OF THESE SHOWERS...HAVE SCALED BACK POPS TONIGHT...AND
HAVE REMOVED THEM ALL TOGETHER ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF OF THE CWA
AFTER 06Z. HOWEVER...SOME LINGERING SCATTERED ACTIVITY WILL BE
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES AND MOUNTAINS THROUGH 12Z THIS
MORNING. THOUGH SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS WILL TAKE PLACE
OVERNIGHT...THINK THAT CLEARING WILL BE SLOW OVER A GOOD PORTION OF
THE AREA...AND WAS SLOWER TO SCALE BACK ON CLOUD COVER TONIGHT.
THINK THAT THESE CLOUDS MAY ALSO HELP TO KEEP LOWS A DEGREE OR TWO
WARMER TONIGHT AND BOTTOM OUT IN THE MID TO UPPER 30S...WITH THE
POSSIBLE EXCEPTION OF THE FAR WESTERN ZONES WHICH COULD DIP INTO
THE LOW 30S.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...THE WIDE BAND OF SHOWERS MOVING 
ACROSS THE MRX CWA THIS EVENING WILL PULL OUT OVERNIGHT AS A COLD 
FRONT TRACKS ACROSS THE AREA.  ASSOCIATED WINDS WILL SLOWLY DIMINISH 
AS THE SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH.  A WIND ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT 
OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS UNTIL MIDNIGHT 
EDT.  THE WIND ADVISORY OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WILL BE ALLOWED 
TO END AT 20Z.  COOLER...DRIER AIR WILL FILTER IN ON TUESDAY WITH 
HIGHS CLIMBING INTO THE 50S ACROSS THE TN VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL LINGER OVER THE ERN STATES THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...LIFT NE ON 
THURSDAY FOLLOWED BY SOME PROLONGED NW FLOW ALOFT. HEIGHTS DON'T 
REALLY RISE MUCH...ALTHO UPPER FLOW DOES BECOME MORE ZONAL BY LATE 
IN THE WEEKEND. UNFORTUNATELY...MODELS STILL DIVERGE A GOOD DEAL 
FROM LATE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK... LEAVING CONFIDENCE 
GENERALLY LOW FOR SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK. 

SOME VERY LIGHT QPF IS INDICATED FOR MAINLY SW VA AND NE TN DURING 
THE NW FLOW PERIOD...BUT THESE LOOK TO BE TRACE TO A FEW HUNDREDTHS 
EVENTS AT BEST. THUS...STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS AS MUCH AS 
POSSIBLE. FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGGING SOUTH SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY 
SUPPORTS SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. MONDAY WAS INTRODUCED 
WITH LOW POPS AS WELL...GIVEN THE LATEST DIFFERENCES BETWEEN GFS AND 
ECMWF. 

FOR TEMPS...STARTING OUT BELOW SEASONAL NORMALS THEN WARMING TO AND 
ABOVE BY SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. MIN TEMPS LOOK SUFFICIENTLY WARM 
ENOUGH FOR MAINLY LIQUID PRECIPITATION AFTER THURSDAY MORNING. THE 
12Z GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE QUITE CLOSE TO 00Z NUMBERS...SO LITTLE 
VARIANCE FROM THE 00Z MOS FOR NOW.

304 AM EDT MON MAR 11 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
RAIN OVER MIDDLE TN IS NOT MAKING MUCH EASTWARD PROGRESS AT THE 
MOMENT...BUT WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE AREA LATER THIS MORNING AS 
THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS AND UPPER JET SHIFT EAST. MODELS ARE IN 
AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THE STRONGEST LIFT OVER THE 
AREA...BETWEEN 15Z AND 21Z. FRONTAL PASSAGE APPEARS TO BE BETWEEN 
21Z AND 03Z. WILL KEEP A CHANCE POP GOING UNTIL THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH 
PASSAGE OCCURS AROUND 12Z.

CURRENT OBS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS SHOW WIND GUSTS IN THE 
30-40 MPH RANGE SO FAR...WITH SUSTAINED WINDS AROUND 15 MPH.
EXPECT WINDS TO CONTINUE TO STRENGTHEN THROUGH THE EARLY MORNING AS
THE LLJ SHIFTS EAST. THE CURRENT WIND ADVISORY LOOKS ON TRACK AND
WILL NOT BE CHANGED...ALTHOUGH SOME PORTIONS OF THE ADVISORY
OUTSIDE THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LOOK MARGINAL FOR REACHING CRITERIA.

TEMPS ARE STARTING OUT QUITE WARM SO FAR THIS MORNING...AND
DOWNSLOPE WINDS MAY HELP ADD A FEW DEGREES TO HIGH TEMPS IN THE
VALLEY...SO WILL GO ON THE WARM SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE TODAY. TEMPS
WILL BE FALLING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AS PRECIP SPREADS EAST.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH MOST OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST. DRIER
AIR WILL SPILL INTO THE REGION FOR TUESDAY WITH RETURN OF SUNSHINE
BY AFTERNOON...BUT A SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE CENTRAL
APPALACHIANS TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING BRINGING WITH IT A
SHOT OF COLDER AIR. ENOUGH WRAP-AROUND BOUNDARY LAYER
MOISTURE/UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE MOUNTAINS AND LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY
TO PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE
FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT
SNOW SHOWERS. LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATIONS ARE ANTICIPATED.
PRECIPITATION ENDS BY AFTERNOON WEDNESDAY.

DEEP UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES BEGINS TO MOVE 
EAST LATE IN THE WEEK WITH A WARM FRONT SETTING UP ACROSS FROM THE 
MID-WEST INTO THE OHIO/TENNESSEE VALEYS BY FRIDAY. INCREASING CLOUD 
COVER ANTICIPATED BY FRIDAY. ECMWF AND GFS BEGIN TO DIFFER GREATLY 
IN EVOLUTION OF THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY AND CYCLOGENESIS ALONG THE 
FRONT..SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW IN POPS AND CLOUDS FOR NEXT WEEKEND. 
EITHER WAY...A BOUNDARY WILL BE ALONG/NEAR THE FORECAST AREA WITH A 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS. INSTABILITY LIMITED NEXT WEEKEND...SO KEPT 
THUNDER OUT OF THE FORECAST..BUT GIVEN TIME-OF-THE-YEAR..THUNDER 
BECOMES MORE OF A POTENTIAL WITH THESE TYPES OF WEST TO EAST 
BOUNDARIES.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED MEX MOS NUMBERS CLOSELY..SINCE EXACT LOCATION OF 
THE BOUNDARY WILL HAVE A MAJOR IMPACT ON TEMPERATURES LATE THIS WEEK 
AND NEXT WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...
THE MAIN WEATHER STORY FOR THIS EVENING WILL BE THE STRONG GRADIENT
WINDS AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AND COLD FRONT
FROM THE WEST. WITH SOUTHERLY TO SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS EXPECTED OVER
THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU AND A STOUT 50-60 KT OVER MIDDLE
TENNESSEE...SOME LOCALIZED MOUNTAIN WAVE ACTIVITY WILL POSSIBLE
TONIGHT AND INTO THE MORNING HOURS TOMORROW ACROSS THE FAVORED
AREAS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE LATEST
OBS/TRENDS AND THE OVERALL PRESSURE FALLS TO THE WEST OF THE REGION
NOT PROGGED TO BE AS HIGH AS IN PREVIOUS EVENTS THIS YEAR...HAVE
OPTED TO STICK WITH THE WIND ADVISORY FOR NOW...AS SUSTAINED WINDS
AND GUSTS SHOULD STAY BELOW THE REQUIRED CRITERIA FOR A HIGH WIND
WARNING. HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THROUGHOUT THE EVENING
AND OVERNIGHT AS IT DOES APPEAR TO BE SOMEWHAT OF A CLOSE CALL. 

OTHERWISE...CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD THE AREA AND WILL
LOWER OVER THE COURSE OF THE NIGHT AS THE BOUNDARY LAYER
MOISTENS. SOME LIGHT SHOWERS ARE CURRENTLY TRACKING ACROSS MIDDLE
TENNESSEE AND COULD VERY WELL WORK THEIR WAY INTO THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AFTER MIDNIGHT...SO HAVE INCREASED
POPS THERE TO LOW END CHANCE AFTER 06Z. OTHERWISE...THE BREEZY
SOUTHERLY WINDS AND CLOUD COVER WILL HELP TO KEEP LOWS FAIRLY MIND
IN THE MID 40S TO LOWER 50S IN MOST SPOTS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
330 PM EDT SUN MAR 10 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING ALONG THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD...WITH A SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF IT 
BRINGING UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL STRENGTHEN FURTHER TONIGHT AND MONDAY...AS A 
COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVES EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. IN 
FACT...MODELS INDICATE THAT A STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 60 KT) WILL 
DEVELOP TONIGHT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A SOUTHERLY WIND 
FLOW AND STABLE LAYER OCCURRING OVER THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. 
THUS...IT APPEARS THAT CONDITIONS WILL BE CONDUCIVE FOR THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF MOUNTAIN WAVES IN THE FOOTHILLS. WITH THIS IN MIND... 
WILL EXPAND THE WIND ADVISORY TO INCLUDE MORE OF THE FOOTHILLS...AND 
WILL ALSO INCLUDE THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WHERE SOME MOUNTAIN WAVE 
WINDS MAY DEVELOP AS WELL. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE 
EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS COLD FRONT...AND INDICATE THAT THE MAIN 
AREA OF SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO AFFECT THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU TOWARDS 
NOON ON MONDAY. THESE SHOWERS SHOULD THEN SPREAD ACROSS THE REST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA MOSTLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS ON 
MONDAY. NAM MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME WEAK 
INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE MONDAY AFTERNOON...BUT 
WILL NOT MENTION ANY THUNDER SINCE THE GFS MODEL SOLUTION IS MORE 
STABLE. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SLIGHT 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY LOOK 
TO BEGIN A WARMING TREND OVER THE AREA WITH INCREASING CLOUDS EACH 
DAY. THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT WAS CAUSING RAIN SHOWERS OVER THE 
AREA EARLIER IN THE WEEK HAS MOVED NORTHEAST...AND WILL CONTINUE TO 
STRENGTHEN. WINDS ON WEDNESDAY...MAINLY IN THE MORNING HOURS...COULD 
BE STRONG WITH GUSTS BETWEEN 30 AND 40 MPH. THIS IS DUE TO A LOW 
LEVEL JET MOVING AROUND THE DEPARTING LOW. MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL 
BEGIN INCREASING HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS ACROSS THE AREA. A 
BOUNDARY WILL SET UP ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE CWA THROUGH THE 
REST OF THE WORK WEEK...AS THE FLOW ACROSS THE US BECOMES MORE 
ZONAL. DUE TO UPSLOPE FLOW AND THE MOISTURE INCREASE. HAVE KEPT IN 
SLIGHT POPS FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND AREAWIDE FRIDAY. A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR LIGHT SNOW CAN BE 
EXPECTED EARLY FRIDAY MORNING...BUT EXPECT MAINLY LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS 
WITH THESE POPS THROUGH THE DAY FRIDAY. CHANCE POPS WILL CONTINUE 
INTO SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. MODELS CONTINUE TO DISAGREE SLIGHTLY ON 
TIMING AND LOCATION OF THESE RAIN SHOWERS...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW. 
INSTABILITY AND SHEAR HAVE INCREASED FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY FROM 
PREVIOUS RUNS. AT THE MOMENT...EXPECT ISOLATED TO SCATTERED RAIN 
SHOWERS THROUGH THE WEEKEND. THE THREAT FOR THUNDERSTORMS DOES NOT 
LOOK STRONG ENOUGH TO WARRANT INCLUDING IN FORECAST...BUT MORE MODEL 
RUNS NEEDED TO SAY WITH MUCH CERTAINTY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING 
ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD...WITH A SOUTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA BRINGING UNSEASONABLY WARM AND DRY AIR INTO THE AREA. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER MOST OF THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY THIS MORNING...WHICH WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON AS A COLD FRONT TRIGGERS CONVECTION OVER THE 
LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. WINDS WILL BECOME BREEZY ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON...AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT INCREASES BETWEEN THE 
HIGH TO THE EAST AND THE COLD FRONT TO THE WEST.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL UPDATE 
THIS MORNING TO TWEAK THE WIND AND TEMP FORECAST A LITTLE ACCORDING

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL BE STRENGTHENING THROUGH THE DAY AS THE TN 
VALLEY GETS SQUEEZED BETWEEN HIGH PRESSURE ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST 
AND A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKING ACROSS THE PLAINS. WARM 
ADVECTION WILL BRING TEMPS WELL INTO THE 60S IN MOST SPOTS...POSSIBLY
TOUCHING 70 IN THE VALLEY. CURRENT VWP FROM KHTX SHOWS SOME STRONG
WINDS JUST ABOVE THE SURFACE...AND WITH DAYTIME MIXING WE COULD SEE
SOME GUSTY WINDS IN THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN VALLEY. THE LLJ
CONTINUES TO STRENGTHEN TONIGHT AS THE NAM AND GFS SHOW 850 MB
WINDS 50-60 KTS. CONFIDENCE IS HIGH ENOUGH TO GO WITH A WIND
ADVISORY FROM 00Z MONDAY TO 20Z MONDAY FOR THE MOUNTAINS. 

PRECIP CURRENTLY SEEN ON RADAR ACROSS WEST/MIDDLE TN AND NRN AL IS
NOT REACHING THE GROUND...AND THE COLUMN WILL REMAIN DRY UP TO 700
MB TODAY AND THIS EVENING. LOW LEVELS DO NOT BEGIN TO MOISTEN UNTIL
LATE TONIGHT...AND LIFT REMAINS WEAK THROUGH THE NIGHT. WILL LOWER
POPS BACK TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH AND WEST LATE TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
FOR MONDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO AND
TENNESSEE VALLEYS WITH A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM JETS
COMBINING TO PRODUCE STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE OVER THE FORECAST
AREA. DIRECT CIRCULATION AROUND THE JET WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTO-
GENETIC FORCING ALONG THE FRONT MONDAY AND MONDAY EVENING. WILL
CONTINUE WITH CATEGORICAL POPS FOR MONDAY. MODEL SOUNDINGS CONTINUE
TO SHOW A VOID OF INSTABILITY EVEN THOUGH DYNAMICS IS STRONG. WILL
KEEP THUNDER OUT OF THE FORECAST FOR NOW. AS WAS STATED BY THE
SHORT-TERM FORECASTER...STRONG LOW-LEVEL JET WILL PRODUCE WINDY
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND BREEZY IN THE VALLEY. A
MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WIND EVENT IS EXPECTED...SO WINDY CONDITIONS
ACROSS THE ADJACENT FOOTHILLS ARE ANTICIPATED MONDAY.

FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...RE-ENFORCING COLD AIR WILL KEEP BROKEN 
CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE NORTHEAST THIRD OF THE AREA..ESPECIALLY THE 
MOUNTAINS WITH A CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS. NO SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

FOR THE LATTER HALF OF THE WEEK (ESPECIALLY NEXT WEEKEND)...UPPER 
FLOW WILL REMAIN NORTHWEST/WEST WITH A BOUNDARY SETTING UP OVER THE 
LOWER OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEYS. MODELS SHOW INCREASING GULF MOISTURE 
JUST SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY WITH MARGINAL INSTABILITY. INCREASING 
CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED FRIDAY AND SATURDAY.

BRINGING MILD TEMPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW WILL STRENGTHEN FURTHER ON SUNDAY...WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO RISE

AS A COLD FRONT SLOWLY MOVES INTO THE MS RIVER VALLEY. MODELS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS COLD FRONT... 
AND PROGNOSTICATE IT TO MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON MONDAY 
WITH SHOWERS SPREADING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. NAM MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME 
WEAK INSTABILITY OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY AFTERNOON...BUT 
FOR NOW...WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION ONLY SHOWERS SINCE THE GFS MODEL

A DEEP HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL BE MOVING EAST ACROSS THE 
APPALACHIAN REGION TODAY...WITH A SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW 
DEVELOPING ACROSS THE TN VALLEY AS THE RIDGE AXIS MOVES EAST OF THE 
MOUNTAINS. HIGH CLOUDS FROM A JET STREAK OVER LA/AR WILL BE 
OVERHEAD...BUT SATELLITE TRENDS THIS MORNING SUGGEST THAT CLOUDS 
SHOULD REMAIN SCATTERED ENOUGH TO HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON THE SENSIBLE 
WEATHER. TEMPERATURES WILL RISE INTO THE 60S IN MOST LOCATIONS 
OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS. FALLING 500 MB HEIGHTS AND AN APPROACHING 
UPPER JET WILL BRING GREATER CLOUD COVER TO THE AREA LATE 
TONIGHT...AS WELL AS A STRENGTHENING LLJ AS THE 850 MB LOW TRACKS 
ACROSS THE PLAINS. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...
RIDGE AXIS WILL BE EAST OF THE AREA FOR SUNDAY WITH INCREASING
HIGH AND MID-LEVEL CLOUDS AND QUITE MILD. FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND
ESPECIALLY MONDAY...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE TOWARD THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY WITH ASSOCIATED UPPER JET OVER THE EASTERN OHIO VALLEY
PLACING THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED DIVERGENCE ALOFT. THE
UPPER JET WILL HELP MAINTAIN THE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING ALONG AND
FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY AFTERNOON. AN
AREA OF SHOWERS WILL ACCOMPANY THE FRONT. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW
LIMITED INSTABILITY FOR THUNDER...SO HAVE KEEPED ONLY SHOWERS IN
THE FORECAST.

THE ECMWF AND GFS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN REGARD TO TIMING OF THIS 
FEATURE SO HAVE GONE WITH HIGH/CAT POPS FOR MONDAY. BESIDES THE 
SHOWERS...50-60 KT LOW-LEVEL JET (850MB) WILL PRODUCE WINDY/BREEZY 
CONDITIONS FOR MONDAY. MINOR MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WIND EVENT POSSIBLE 
FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS MONDAY.

PLENTY OF WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE AND SOME UPSLOPE INTO THE MOUNTAINS 
TO KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS/LIKELY MOUNTAINS FOR MONDAY 
NIGHT/TUESDAY MORNING. RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE AREA FOR 
WEDNESDAY...BUT BOTH THE ECMWF/GFS SHOW ANOTHER WEAK SHORT-WAVE IN 
NORTHWEST FLOW MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN FORECAST AREA FOR THURSDAY 
AND THURSDAY NIGHT. CONFIDENCE ON TIMING AND STRENGTH OF THIS 
SHORT-WAVE REMAINS LOW.

WEAKENED SINCE PAST MODEL RUNS...BUT STILL EXPECT SOME GUSTY WINDS 
MAINLY EARLY MONDAY MORNING AND INTO EARLY AFTERNOON. LOW PRESSURE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE BUILDING OVER THE TN VALLEY REGION 
THROUGH TODAY AND TONIGHT. LINGERING CLOUDS EARLY THIS MORNING ARE 
ALREADY ERODING...AND WE SHOULD SEE CLEAR SKIES BY LATE MORNING. 
WITH A CLOSED LOW STATIONARY OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST AND THE HIGH 
AMPLITUDE RIDGE TO THE WEST...MODELS INDICATE THAT THERE WILL BE A 
FAIRLY TIGHT 1000-850 MB THICKNESS GRADIENT ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. 
THIS WILL RESULT IN A LARGE NE-SW TEMPERATURE DIFFERENCE...WITH MID 
40S NE TO UPPER 50S SW. WITH CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT AND NEARLY CALM 
WINDS...LOWS WILL BE IN THE MID 20S TO LOWER 30S. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL BEGIN THE LONG
TERM FORECAST FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT WITH INCREASING HIGH
AND MID-LEVEL CLOUDS. FOR SUNDAY...RIDGE AXIS MOVES EAST OF THE
AREA WITH GOOD SOUTHERLY FLOW AND THICKENING HIGH AND MID-LEVEL
CLOUDS. THE ECMWF AND GFS SHOWS BOTH NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM
TROUGHING MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES AND SOUTHERN
PLAINS. THE MEDIMUM RANGE MODELS DO DIFFER ON THE STRENGTH OF THE
SOUTHERN STREAM ENERGY WITH THE GFS THE STRONGEST AND THE ECMWF
KEEPING A MORE AMPLIFIED NORTHERN STREAM WAVE. HOWEVER...BOTH
MODELS KEEP PRECIPITATION WEST OF THE AREA THROUGH SUNDAY WITH
BRUNT OF THE SHOWER ACTIVITY FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT AS
FRONTAL-GENETIC FORCING INCREASES.

MODEL SOUNDINGS DO NOT WARRANT MENTIONING OF THUNDER IN THE FORECAST 
AS INSTABILITY NOT PRESENT...BUT THIS COULD CHANGE WITH LATER RUNS.
COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH MONDAY/EARLY MONDAY NIGHT WITH RAIN ENDING 
TUESDAY MORNING.

FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED (WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY)...MEDIMUM RANGE 
MODELS DIFFER ON AMPLIFICATION OF NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH WITH THE 
ECMWF DEEPER AND COLDER FOR THE AREA. WILL TREND TOWARD THE LESS 
AMPLIFIED GFS MODEL.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
A PERSISTENT DECK OF LOW CLOUDS CONTINUES TO REMAIN ENTRENCHED
ACROSS THE AREA EARLY THE MORNING...AND IS ACTUALLY EXPANDING TO
THE SOUTH AND WEST GIVEN THE LIGHT NORTH/NORTHWEST FLOW ACROSS THE
AREA. GIVEN THE LATEST TRENDS...FEEL THAT THIS CLOUD COVER WILL BE
SLOWER TO ERODE THAN THE MODELS ARE SHOWING AFTER SUNRISE...
PARTICULARLY ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES...BEFORE THEY BEGIN TO
ERODE FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST BY THE AFTERNOON. THUS...HAVE
INCREASED CLOUD COVER TO MOSTLY CLOUDY/OVERCAST DURING THE MORNING
HOURS. SOME LOCALIZED LIGHT FREEZING DRIZZLE WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE
ACROSS MUCH OF THE NORTHEAST ZONES THROUGH MID-MORNING GIVEN THE
MOIST BOUNDARY LAYER...SO HAVE KEPT A MENTION OF THIS AS WELL
THROUGH 14Z. GIVEN THE LINGERING CLOUDS...HIGHS MAY BE A FEW
DEGREES COOLER THAN PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT...BUT THEY WILL STILL BE
10-15 DEGREES WARMER THAN YESTERDAY IN SEVERAL AREAS...REACHING THE
UPPER 40S TO MID 50S IN THE CENTRAL/LOWER VALLEY. TEMPS WILL BE A
LITTLE COOLER FURTHER TO THE NORTHEAST IN THE UPPER 30S/LOWER 40S
ACROSS NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. BY THE EVENING...SKIES WILL
BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR IN MANY AREAS...THOUGH MODEL DATA IS INDICATING
SOME LOW STRATUS RETURNING ACROSS THE NORTHEAST ZONES LATE TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
SHOULD BE ONE OF THE BEST 
WEEKENDS FOR THE FORECAST AREA IN QUITE A LONG TIME. SURFACE AND 
UPPER RIDGE BUILD INTO THE REGION...WITH THE UPPER RIDGE AMPLIFYING 
ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS BY SATURDAY. SURFACE RIDGE WILL BE ALONG THE 
EASTERN COAST BY SUNDAY ALLOWING A GOOD FETCH OF SOUTHERLY FLOW TO 
WARM TEMPS TO ABOVE SEASONAL NORMALS FOR A WELCOMED CHANGE. 

COLD FRONT APPROACHES ON MONDAY AND I DID NOT SEE ANY REASON TO 
INCREASE POPS JUST YET FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. TIMING OF LIKELY POPS ON 
MONDAY LOOKED ON TRACK AND I KEPT A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. NOT 
QUITE CERTAIN ENOUGH TO GO LIKELY POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT...SO STAYED 
WITH 50 PERCENT FOR NOW. GFS AND CANADIAN MODELS SUPPORT LOWERING 
POPS TO 20 TO 30 PERCENT BY TUESDAY...WHILE ECMWF WAS A BIT SLOWER 
WITH SOME LINGERING SHOWERS ON BACKSIDE OF EXITING SYSTEM TUESDAY. 
KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS IN LINE WITH GFS AND CANADIAN 
MODELS. DRY WEDNESDAY WITH SEASONAL TEMPERATURES.

OTHERWISE...07/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS WERE SIMILAR OVERALL TO CURRENT 
GRIDS. I DID MAKE A FEW ADJUSTMENTS IN MAX AND MIN TEMPS OVER THE 
WEEKEND TO BE CLOSER TO 00Z GFSX. BEST PERIOD FOR IMPROVEMENT OVER 
GFSX MOS STILL APPEARS TO BE TUESDAY...WHILE LITTLE IMPROVEMENT FOR 
OTHER PERIODS AT THIS TIME.

425 AM EST WED MAR 6 2013

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
EARLY THIS MORNING...SCATTERED NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS
CONTINUE TO PUSH OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON THE
BACKSIDE OF AN UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM THAT IS SHIFTING
EAST INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES. THESE SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO
DEVELOP AND MOVE ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING...WITH SOME LOCALLY
HEAVIER ACTIVITY POSSIBLE ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN...ESPECIALLY
FROM 09Z THROUGH 15-18Z WHEN MOISTURE/LIFT VALUES WILL BE GREATEST.
HOWEVER...LIGHT TO MODERATE SHOWERS WILL LINGER THROUGH THE
AFTERNOON/EVENING AND OVERNIGHT ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE
SMOKIES BEFORE FINALLY TAPERING OFF BY THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT
HOURS. THESE SHOWERS WILL FAVOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EAST
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...AS WELL AS PORTIONS OF NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU.

A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR THE NORTHERN
PLATEAU...FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...WHERE
GENERALLY BETWEEN 1-4 INCHES IS EXPECTED THROUGH MIDNIGHT TONIGHT.
ANOTHER WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR SOUTHWEST NORTH
CAROLINA FOR 1-4 INCHES AS WELL...BUT ONLY WILL GO THROUGH 7 PM AS
THE SNOW WILL DIMINISH THERE BY SUNSET. A WINTER STORM WARNING IS
IN EFFECT FOR WISE COUNTY VA AND THE MOUNTAIN ZONES OF EAST
TENNESSEE WHERE BETWEEN 4-8 INCHES IS EXPECTED...WITH UP TO FOOT
POSSIBLE ALONG THE HIGHEST PEAKS BY 6 AM THURSDAY. MOST VALLEY
LOCATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO RECEIVE MINOR ACCUMULATIONS...WITH ONLY A
DUSTING TO PERHAPS HALF IN INCH TO AN INCH IN A SOME LOCALIZED
AREAS. ALSO...GIVEN THE STRONG GRADIENT WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS
STORM SYSTEM...A WIND ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN EFFECT THOUGH 22Z.
THE HIGHEST GUSTS WILL OCCUR ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN...WHICH WILL
LEAD TO BLOWING/DRIFTING SNOW...FURTHER EXASPERATING THE TRAVEL
CONDITIONS IN THE WARNING AREAS TODAY AND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
SOME LINGERING LOW CLOUDS 
OVER FAR NE AREAS THURSDAY MORNING SO ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW 
SHOWERS. OTHERWISE...SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE WORK EAST INTO THE TN 
VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY FRIDAY. HEIGHTS INCREASE ALOFT 
INTO SUNDAY WITH SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPING BY SATURDAY 
NIGHT. TEMPS RISE TO SEASONAL VALUES BY FRIDAY THEN SEVERAL DEGREES 
ABOVE NORMAL BY THE WEEKEND.

FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...MODELS SEEMED TO BE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT AND 
IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. A COLD FRONT APPROACHES SUNDAY 
NIGHT WITH THE ASSOCIATED AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKING NE THROUGH 
THE OHIO VALLEY INTO ERN CANADA BY EARLY TUESDAY. GOOD CONTINUITY IN 
BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS (NO WINTRY PCPN!) ON MONDAY...SO NUDGED POPS 
UP TO 50 PERCENT FOR NOW. KEPT LOW POPS LINGERING INTO TUESDAY AS 
BEFORE...BUT STAYED ABOUT 20 PERCENT BELOW 06/00Z GFSX MOS POPS. 
THIS LOOKS TO BE A TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE OVER GUIDANCE AS 
QPF WOULD BE VERY LIGHT EARLY TUESDAY...PROBABLY TRACE AMOUNTS SOUTH 
TO JUST A FEW HUNDREDTHS NORTH. KEPT QUITE CLOSE TO 06/00Z GFXS MOS 
TEMPS THROUGH THE LONG TERM.

THE WINTER STORM WARNING REMAINS IN EFFECT...AND THE WATCH WILL BE
UPDATED TO ADVISORY OR WARNING BEFORE THE AFTERNOON FORECAST

401 AM EST TUE MAR 5 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...RAIN STARTING TO INCREASE
OVER MIDDLE TN AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. OTHER
THAN SLOWING DOWN THE ONSET OF LIGHT RAIN THIS MORNING...LITTLE
CHANGES WERE MADE FOR TODAY. KEPT SHOWERS AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON...WHEN SOUNDINGS SUGGEST SOME ELEVATED
INSTABILITY. 

FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...00Z GFS MODEL SEEMS MUCH CLOSER TO NAM
IN TIMING THE ARRIVAL OF THE COLD AIR. THIS SUPPORTS VIRTUALLY NO
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS UNTIL TONIGHT...OF COURSE STARTING EARLIEST ON
THE NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE SMOKIES. ONE
TROUBLESOME FEATURE IS THE HINT OF A DRY SLOT INITIALLY BEHIND THE
COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE...WHILE ANOTHER IS THE DIFFERING PATHS OF
HEAVIER QPF. SOME CONCERN THAT NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES COULD EXCEED 4
INCHES OF SNOW IN 12 HOURS...AND ALSO HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA. 

BY WEDNESDAY MORNING...COLD AIR AND MORE MOISTURE WRAP AROUND INTO
THE REGION...WITH PLENTY OF PRECIPITABLE WATER TO GENERATE MORE
SNOWFALL. THERE IS A PERIOD OF GOOD UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE FAVORED
AREAS SUCH AS SMOKIES...GENERALLY FROM 15Z TO 21Z WEDNESDAY. THESE
AREAS SHOULD HAVE NO PROBLEM GETTING 6 INCHES OR MORE OF TOTAL SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS. CUTTING MAX TEMPS CONSIDERABLY ON WEDNESDAY AS IN
PREVIOUS GRIDS...WHICH ALLOWS FOR ACCUMULATING SNOW INTO WEDNESDAY 
EVENING.

BASED ON ALL OF THE ABOVE REASONING AND PER COORDINATION WITH NWS
NEIGHBORS...DECISION WAS MADE TO UPGRADE NRN AND SMOKY MTNS TO A
WARNING. WENT WITH A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR ERN POLK...CLAY
AND CHEROKEE COUNTIES. TOUGHER CALL ON NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA...
SO OPTED TO GIVE THE DAY SHIFT SOME TIME TO LOOK AT THE 06Z AND 12Z
MODEL RUNS. KEEPING THOSE AREAS AS A WATCH FOR NOW. EXTENDED THE
WARNING AND ADVISORY GROUPS ENDING TIME TO 11Z THURSDAY IN LINE
WITH ERN NWS NEIGHBORS. WIND SPEEDS AND GUSTS TONIGHT INTO
WEDNESDAY MAY REACH ADVISORY CRITERIA.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
SNOW SHOWERS WILL GRADUALLY TAPER OFF WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS THE 
UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS EAST INTO THE MID ATLANTIC 
REGION. STILL...SOME SCATTERED NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF EAST TENNESSEE AND ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THROUGH 12Z THURSDAY...WITH SOME LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE. THEREAFTER...WARMER AND DRIER CONDITIONS ARE 
EXPECTED FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE WORK WEEK AND INTO THE WEEKEND 
AS AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE AREA. SW FLOW...ABUNDANT 
SUNSHINE AND INCREASED THICKNESS VALUES WILL ALLOW HIGHS TO JUMP 
BACK INTO THE UPPER 50S AND LOWER 60S BY FRIDAY AND INTO THE MID TO 
UPPER 60S IN MANY LOCATIONS BY THE WEEKEND. ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH 
WILL EVENTUALLY PUSH TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA LATE SUNDAY INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...BRINGING INCREASED CLOUD COVER/PRECIP CHANCES LATE IN 
THE PERIOD...ALONG WITH SOME SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPERATURES HEADING 
INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...FROM FAIR AND CHILLY TODAY TO
WET AND WARMER TUESDAY. AND THAT IS JUST THE BEGINNING OF THE
ROLLER COASTER THAT WILL INCLUDE SNOW FOLLOWED BY WARM SPRINGTIME
TEMPS IN THE LONG TERM. BUT ZEROING IN ON TONIGHT AND TUESDAY...
HIGH CLOUDS MOVING IN AHEAD OF DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM. TEMPS AT 3
PM STILL FAIRLY COOL AND DEWPOINTS STILL VERY DRY. MIN TEMPS
TONIGHT MAY BE INTERESTING...I TRIED TO HIT THE MINS DURING THE LATE
EVENING OVER THE SW PORTION OF THE CWA FOLLOWED BY GRADUAL
OVERNIGHT WARMING. IN CENTRAL AREAS HAVE FLIRTED WITH MIN TEMPS
NEAR MIDNIGHT WITH LITTLE CHANGE THE REST OF THE NIGHT. FOR THE
NORTHEASTERN AREAS...MOSTLY A FAIRLY NORMAL DIURNAL CURVE.
SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL ONSET IN THE SW AREAS AT SOME POINT OVERNIGHT
BUT PROBABLY LIGHT AND VAR IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY
TONIGHT. RAIN CHANCES RISE RAPIDLY ESPECIALLY AFTER
MIDNIGHT...COMING IN FROM THE WEST. FOR TUESDAY...CATEGORICAL RAIN
SHOWERS. I INCLUDED MENTION OF ISOLATED AFTERNOON THUNDERSTORMS...
MOSTLY CONSTRAINED TO WARM SECTOR NEAR SURFACE FRONT AS IT MOVES
THROUGH AT THAT TIME. DIDN/T PUT THE TSTMS INTO VA OR TRI-CITIES
VICINITY BUT DID FOR MOST OF THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF
AREA. FROPA LATE IN THE DAY WILL EASE US INTO THE WINTRY SCENARIO
DISCUSSED BELOW.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...PERIOD STARTS OUT COLD
WITH POSSIBILITY OF SOME SIGNIFICANT SNOW ESPECIALLY HIGHER
TERRAIN. MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT IN HANDLING OF COLDER AIR
COMING IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT...AS AN UPPER LOW TRACKS
ACROSS THE REGION. APPEARS THERE WILL BE ADEQUATE LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE...AND LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY LOOKS FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE AT
LEAST FOR A PERIOD LATER TUESDAY NIGHT AS UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS.
FLOW TURNS MORE NORTHWEST WEDNESDAY...BUT MOISTURE STARTS TO BECOME
MORE SHALLOW BY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. IT APPEARS THE GREATEST
THREAT FOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS THAT WOULD REACH WARNING CRITERIA
WILL BE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND THE NORTHERN AND
CENTRAL TN MOUNTAINS DOWN AS FAR SOUTH AS MONROE COUNTY.
HOWEVER...AT THIS TIME WILL LEAVE WINTER STORM WATCH AS IS SINCE
WARNING CRITERIA SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE STILL POSSIBLE IN NORTHERN
PLATEAU AND SW NC/POLK MOUNTAIN ZONES...BUT THESE AREAS ARE MORE
LIKELY TO END UP WITH AN ADVISORY RATHER THAN A WARNING THAN ARE
THE OTHER WATCH AREAS. SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS ALSO POSSIBLE IN
VALLEY AREAS MAINLY NORTH INTO CENTRAL VALLEY AS WELL AS SOUTHERN
PLATEAU COUNTIES. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN THURSDAY WITH
UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN BY THE WEEKEND...SO EXPECT DRY AND WARMING
CONDITIONS FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK. MODELS STILL INCONSISTENT
FURTHER OUT...BUT NEXT SYSTEM MAY APPROACH BY MONDAY. WILL UNDERCUT
MAV TEMPS EARLY...ESPECIALLY WEDNESDAY...OTHERWISE MAINLY JUST SOME
TWEAKS TO GFS MOS TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FORECAST FOR TODAY WILL FEATURE

OVER SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN THIS MORNING. SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE 
QUICKLY SLIP EAST...AHEAD OF THE DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
THE NRN AND CENTRAL PLAINS. WARM AIR ADVECTION DEVELOPS OVER THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON...BUT MOST MODELS KEEP OUR 
WEATHER DRY. THUS...I DROPPED THE SPRINKLES FOR NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES 
FOR THIS AFTERNOON. WARMER TEMPS SUGGESTED FOR TODAY...BUT CLOUDS 
MAY HINDER WARMING INTO UPPER 50S. STAYED CLOSE TO GFS MOS FOR HIGHS 
EXCEPT SLIGHTLY BELOW FOR CHA AREA. 

ISENTROPIC LIFT DEVELOPS TONIGHT AS THE SURFACE LOW MOVES NE INTO 
THE MEM TO PAH AREA...AND PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED 
RIGHT ON TRACK. FAVORED THE MILDER GFS MINS OR A FEW DEGREES ABOVE
WHICH KEEPS ANY PRECIPITATION ALL LIQUID (LIGHT RAIN).

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...TUESDAY MODELS STILL IN
GOOD AGREEMENT OF STRONG UPPER TROUGH MOVING INTO THE MISSISSIPPI
RIVER VALLEY WITH AN UPPER JET DIVING SOUTH TOWARD THE NORTHERN
GULF COAST STATES. WARM FRONT EXPECTED TO PASS THROUGH THE REGION
BY 12Z MONDAY AND WITH THE DEEP COLD AIR ALOFT STEEP LAPSE RATES
WILL MAKE THE AIR MASS SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE AND ALLOW A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP. TEMPERATURES WILL STAY MILD IN THE WARM
SECTOR WITH SW WINDS WARMING HIGHS TO THE UPPER 40S HIGHER
ELEVATIONS NORTH TO THE UPPER 50S AROUND CHA. THEN TUESDAY NIGHT
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION ALOFT BEHIND COLD FRONT AS UPPER LOW
MOVING SE FROM THE OHIO VALLEY PRODUCES CONTINUED SHOWER ACTIVITY
OVERNIGHT FREEZING LEVELS DROP LOW ENOUGH TO CHANGE RAIN TO SNOW IN
HIGHER ELEVATIONS AROUND 00Z AND THEN LOWER ELEVATIONS AROUND
MIDNIGHT. SNOWFALL WILL BEGIN TO ACCUMULATE IN THE EVENING IN THE
MOUNTAINS AND AFTER MIDNIGHT LOWER ELEVATIONS. A FEW INCHES WILL
LIKELY FALL BY MORNING IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH LIGHT AMOUNTS IN THE
VALLEYS. THE SNOW WILL CONTINUE IN THE MOUNTAINS ALL DAY AS COLD
AIR ADVECTION AND INCREASING NW FLOW PATTERN TAKES OVER. LOWER
ELEVATIONS SHOULD HAVE SOME MORNING SNOW SHOWERS BUT MAY WARM
ENOUGH FOR SNOW TO CHANGE TO RAIN IN THE AFTERNOON. THE SNOW WILL
CONTINUE OVERNIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TN AND SW VA WITH
ANOTHER INCH OR TWO BEFORE ENDING. FOR LOWS WENT SLIGHTLY BELOW
GUIDANCE TUESDAY NIGHT WHICH WAS JUST BELOW FREEZING MOST PLACES
EXCEPT CHA. WEDNESDAY FOLLOWED EXISTING NUMBERS SEVERAL DEGREES
BELOW GUIDANCE WHICH HAS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BELOW FREEZING AND
OTHER AREAS 5 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW GUIDANCE. WILL ISSUE A WINTER
STORM WATCH SHORTLY FOR THE VIRGINIA AND TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS...THE
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
NORTH CAROLINA. AMOUNTS MAY REACH 6 TO 10 INCHES IN THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY LOWS DROP TO BELOW
FREEZING ONCE MORE WITH POSSIBLE SNOW COVER.

FOR THE THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY TIME FRAME A WARMING TREND WITH

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...AS UPPER TROUGH
ACROSS THE NORTHEAST MOVES EAST...THEN LOW-CLOUDS AND FLURRIES WILL
DISSIPATE THIS EVENING/TONIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. FOR MONDAY...
RIDGING WILL DOMINATE BOTH SURFACE AND ALOFT...BUT PLENTY OF HIGH
AND MID-LEVEL CLOUDS WILL SPILL OVER THE RIDGE INCREASING CLOUDS
ONCE AGAIN. FOR MONDAY NIGHT...A STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES WILL DEEPENING SURFACE LOW
HEADING SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. INCREASING SOUTHERLY
WINDS WILL PRODUCE ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. RAIN
WILL SPREAD INTO THE REGION WITH HIGHEST POPS OVER THE PLATEAU AND
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE.

FOR TUESDAY...STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE MID-
MISSISSIPPI RIVER VALLEY WITH UPPER JET DIVING INTO THE NORTHERN
GULF COAST STATES. THE JET WILL PLACE THE FORECAST AREA UNDER THE
FAVORED RIGHT EXIT REGION OF THE JET. THE CIRCULATION AROUND THE
JET WILL ENHANCE THE FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING WITH THE INCOMING
FRONTAL BOUNDARY. ECMWF/GFS SHOW STRONG FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING OVER
THE AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON. SINCE THE UPPER TROUGH HAS DEEP COLD
AIR WITH 500MB TEMPERATURES BELOW -30 DEGREES CELCIUS...LAPSE RATES
WILL STEEPEN WITH CAPES ALONG AND AHEAD OF FROPA TO WARRANT A
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. 

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION ALOFT
ASSOCIATED WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE UPPER LOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA
WILL CONTINUE TO STEEPEN THE LAPSE RATES. CAPES OF 100-150 J/KG
WILL PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWER ACTIVITY TUESDAY NIGHT DIMINISHING
SLOWLY WEDNESDAY. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW PRECIPITATION WILL
QUICKLY CHANGED TO SNOW SHOWERS TUESDAY EVENING. ALONG WITH THE
INSTABILITY...INCREASING NORTHWEST BOUNDARLY LAYER FLOW WILL
PRODUCE GOOD OROGRAPHIC/NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL INTO THE MOUNTAINS
FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...THEN DIMINISHING WEDENSDAY NIGHT. 

HEAVY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE FOR THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE
MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...SUCH AS
HIGH KNOB. A WINTER STORM WATCH MAY BE NEEDED FOR THESE AREAS.
WIDESPREAD SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY MAY ALSO
PRODUCE LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FOR THE PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST NORTH
CAROLINA MOUNTAINS AND PARTS OF NORTHERN AND CENTRAL TENNESSEE
VALLEY.

FOLLOWED GFS MOS NUMBERS THROUGH TUESDAY...BUT UNDERCUT DUE TO THE
CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION ON WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A FAIRLY BENIGN PERIOD WITH 
NICE SPRING WARMTH TO MAKE UP FOR ALL OF THE RECENT COLD. I WILL TRY 
TO HEDGE A BIT HIGHER ON MAX TEMPS LATE NEXT WEEK THAN THE 00Z MEX 
AND ENSEMBLE MEAN GUIDANCE GAVE...TIPPING THE HAT IN THE DIRECTION 
TOWARD THE WARMEST ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. THE ECMWF IS MORE CONSISTENT 
WITH ITS SOLUTION OF A SLOWER AND DEEPER ROCKIES TROUGH LATE IN THE 
PERIOD THAT WILL HELP US WARM A LITTLE MORE THAN THE 00Z EXTENDED 
GFS AND ENSEMBLE MOS WAS THINKING...AND THUS I WOULD EXPECT US TO 
REMAIN DRIER A LITTLE LONGER THAN GFS WANTS TOO. NO PRECIP MENTIONED 
THROUGH THE PERIOD. 

LOOKING AHEAD...THE GFS RUNS ARE A LITTLE BOUNCY WITH THE DAY 8-9 
FORECAST...WHILE THE ECMWF IS MORE CONSISTENT WITH A FAIRLY 
SIGNIFICANT TROUGH SWEEPING THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT OR TUESDAY 
MORNING. GIVEN THE WARMTH AHEAD OF IT TO WORK WITH...THE BIRD'S EYE 
VIEW MIGHT EXPECT A CONVECTIVE EVENT DURING THAT TROUGH PASSAGE. 
PROBABLY A QUICK RESUMPTION OF SPRING TIME TEMPS THE NEXT DAY 
FOLLOWING THE TROUGH PASSAGE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AREA RADARS NOT SHOWING 
MUCH IN THE WAY OF PRECIPITATION THIS MORNING...ALTHO SURFACE 
OBSERVATIONS INDICATE SOME FLURRIES AT TYS AND TRI. NW CYCLONIC FLOW 
AND COLD AIR ADVECTION PERSIST...BUT FORCING IS RATHER WEAK AT THIS 
TIME. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW SOME POSITIVE CAPE THIS MORNING AND 
AFTERNOON...BUT THE LOW LEVEL WINDS ARE MORE WEST THAN NORTHWEST AND 
NOT THAT STRONG (SO UPSLOPE FLOW SHOULD BE WEAK). ALSO...SURFACE 
TEMPS WILL INHIBIT MOST SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. TOTAL SNOW GRID FOR NEXT 
36 HOURS VARIES FROM TRACE TO ISOLATED SPOTS OF 2 INCHES IN THE 
HIGHEST TERRAIN...SO NO WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES NEEDED. 

KEPT THE LIKELY POPS ACROSS NRN 2/3RDS AS IN PREVIOUS GRIDS...AND 
LIKELY AGAIN TONIGHT OVER NRN/SMOKY MTNS PLUS UPSLOPE AREAS OF SW 
VA. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS MOVES ESE ACROSS AND OUT OF THE SRN 
APPALACHIANS BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON...BUT AGAIN FORCING LOOKS WEAK 
WITH TEMPS GENERALLY TOO WARM TO AID SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. THUS...I 
KEPT JUST CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY AND LOWERED THE LIGHT SNOW 
AMOUNTS FOR SATURDAY. 

CLOUDS AND COLD AIR HAVE KEPT THE RANGE FROM MIN TO MAX TEMP SMALL. 
THIS WILL BE THE PATTERN AGAIN...SO UNDERCUT MAX TEMPS BOTH TODAY 
AND SATURDAY. WENT A FEW DEGREES ABOVE THE GFS MOS MINS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD UPPER TROUGH
HAS MOSTLY PUSHED THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT.
HOWEVER WEAK SHORTWAVES MAY STILL PRODUCE A LITTLE LIGHT SNOW OVER
THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS SATURDAY NIGHT AND IN THE
MOUNTAINS SUNDAY MORNING. SKIES SUNDAY NIGHT WILL BE PARTLY TO
MOSTLY CLOUDY AND TEMPERATURES IN THE 20S. SUNDAY HIGHER PRESSURE
BUILDS IN BUT COLD NORTH TO NW FLOW ALOFT TO BRING DOWN COLD AIR
MASS WITH TEMPERATURES JUST A FEW DEGREES WARMER SOUTH THAN
SATURDAY AND ABOUT THE SAME NORTH AS SATURDAY. SUNDAY NIGHT AND
MONDAY FLOW BECOMES MORE WESTERLY. CLEAR AND COLD SUNDAY NIGHT AND
A LITTLE WARMER MONDAY. NW FLOW PATTERN RESUMES MONDAY NIGHT AND
BRINGS ONE SYSTEM THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WITH RAIN
INITIALLY AND A CHANCE OF SNOW BEHIND IT FOLLOWED BY A TUESDAY
NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY SYSTEM REINFORCING THE COLD AIR MASS WITH RAIN
AND A CHANCE OF SNOW. HIGHER PRESSURE WITH RIDGING ALOFT BUILDS IN

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED 
OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST...WHICH WAS COVERING MOST OF THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION WITH CLOUDS AND LIGHT PRECIP. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
SOME LIGHT SNOW OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS...WHICH WAS ASSOCIATED 
WITH A BROAD BUT WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE THAT WAS SLOWLY SINKING 
SOUTHWARD. IT APPEARS THAT ANY PRECIP TONIGHT WILL BE VERY LIGHT AS 
THIS UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL 
PLAN TO LOWER POPS FOR TONIGHT IN MOST AREAS. ANY ACCUMULATIONS OF 
SNOW WILL LIKELY BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 
FEET...WHERE ONLY UP TO AN INCH APPEARS POSSIBLE. WILL ALSO PLAN TO 
TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...ANOTHER ROUND OF LIGHT SNOW
SHOULD MOVE INTO THE AREA LATE TONIGHT AND INTO FRIDAY...AS COLD LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE AND SLIGHT INSTABILITY SWALLOW UP THE AREA. THE
ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE LIGHT AS THE TEMPERATURES REMAIN RELATIVELY
WARM AND SNOW WILL BE LIGHT AS DENTRITIC TEMPERATURES ARE BARELY
TAPPED INTO. FOR TEMPERATURES...OVERNIGHT MIN TEMPS LOOKED
GOOD...BUT MAX TEMPS FRIDAY LOOKED FAR TOO WARM...WILL GO AT LEAST
ONE CATEGORY BELOW GUIDANCE OVER ENTIRE AREA. THINK MOST PRECIP
DURING THE DAY FRIDAY WILL BE SNOW. THINK SLOW SNOWFALL RATES WILL
KEEP ACCUMULATIONS BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD AIR WILL BE IN 
PLACE FOR SEVERAL DAYS AS OUR UPPER TROUGH OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BE 
REINFORCED BY NEW DISTURBANCES. NOT A SIGNIFICANT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE 
TO WORK WITH BUT ENOUGH TO YIELD OCCASIONAL LIGHT SNOW OR LIGHT 
RAIN...WITH SOME LIGHT ADVISORY TYPE ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE FRIDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH MIDDAY SATURDAY...MOSTLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 
THEN WE WILL GET A DAY OR SO OF FAIR WEATHER BEFORE THE NEXT SYSTEM 
ARRIVES...ALTHOUGH THE PRESENT COLD AIR WILL HAVE DEPARTED BY THEN. 
THE MODELS SEEMED TO BE IN FAIR AGREEMENT UNTIL THE 12Z ECMWF CAME 
IN...IT IS NOW SLOWER WITH THIS SYSTEM WITH PRECIP LINGERING TIL 
THURSDAY MORNING. OUR FORECAST WILL KEEP POPS IN THROUGH THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY AT THIS TIME. THE TRACK OF THIS MID WEEK LOW MAY BE KEY TO 
A MORE SIGNIFICANT WINTER WEATHER PUNCH AS OPPOSED TO THE MOSTLY 
LIGHT AND DRAWN OUT WINTRY WEATHER THAT WILL END THE CURRENT WEEK.

TEMPERATURES ARE A BIT OF A CHALLENGE AS MOS FOR TODAY WAS TOO 
HIGH...SEEMS MOS FOR FRIDAY IS GONNA BE TO HIGH...THUS I CARRIED 
THAT INTO THE WEEKEND WITH UNDERCUTTING OF MOS MAX TEMPS. NEXT WEEKS 
SYSTEM WILL ALSO BE TOUGH ON THE TEMP FORECAST GIVEN THE TIMING AND 
PLACEMENT OF THE LOW AND PRECIPITATION. LEANED TOWARD COOLER THAN 
MOS MAX TEMPS DURING NEXT WEEKS EVENT.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LITTLE CHANGE IN THE WEATHER 
PATTERN THROUGH THE SHORT TERM WITH AN UPPER LOW REMAINING IN PLACE

BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF LIGHT PRECIP.  SCATTERED RAIN WILL TRANSITION 
TO SNOW ACROSS LOWER ELEVATIONS OVERNIGHT WITH LITTLE TO NO 
ACCUMULATIONS.  MOSTLY SNOW EXPECTED AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE.  FAVORED NORTHWEST FLOW LOCATIONS COULD SEE 
1 TO 2 INCHES.  

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIR 
AGREEMENT AND RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY HAS ALSO BEEN DECENT...LEADING 
TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE AVERAGE FORECAST CONFIDENCE FOR THIS TIME OF 
YEAR.  UPPER TROUGH WILL BE SLOWLY TRAVERSING THE AREA EARLY IN THE

ADVECTION PATTERN AND SIGNIFICANT MOISTURE...APPEARS NORTHWEST LOW 
LEVEL FLOW WILL BE TOO WEAK FOR STRONG OROGRAPHIC LIFT...SO WILL 
JUST CONTINUE TO CARRY CHANCE POPS VALLEYS AND LOW LIKELY MOUNTAINS

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED 
OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION...WHICH WAS COVERING MOST OF THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME LIGHT PRECIP ALONG THE 
MOUNTAINS OCCURRING IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE 
ROTATING THROUGH THE BROAD UPPER-LEVEL LONG WAVE TROUGH. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL ROTATE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA LATER TONIGHT...WHICH WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF 
PRECIP WITH A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A 
STEEP LOW-LEVEL LAPSE RATE OVER THE FORECAST AREA...SO EXPECT MOSTLY 
SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WITH SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
POSSIBLE.

330 PM EST WED FEB 27 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...A SERIES OF SHORT-
WAVES WILL ROTATE AROUND BROAD UPPER LOW CENTERED ACROSS THE LOWER
GREAT LAKES. FIRST WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS EARLY THIS EVENING WITH
RADAR ALREADY SHOWING AN AREA OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION OVER BNA. THIS
WAVE WILL PRODUCE LIGHT RAIN (LIGHT SNOW HIGHER ELEVATIONS)...BUT THE
MAIN WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS OVERNIGHT WITH COLD AIR ALOFT ASSOCIATED
WITH SYSTEM. STEEPENING LOW-LEVEL LAPSE RATES AND WESTERLY UPSLOPE
FLOW. PRECIPITATION WILL ONCE AGAIN DEVELOP WITH RAIN/SNOW SHOWERS.
TEMPERATURE PROFILE BECOMES COLD ENOUGH FOR ALL SNOW AT OR ABOVE
2500 FEET WITH ACCUMULATIONS UP TO 2 INCHES ANTICIPATED.

MODELS SHOW THE SYSTEM MOVING EAST OF THE AREA THURSDAY MORNING.
NEXT WAVE MOVING INTO THE REGION FOR THURSDAY NIGHT. NORTHWEST
OROGRAPHIC FLOW STRENGTHENS..SO ANTICIPATE LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS TO
INCREASE IN COVERAGE/INTENSITY. ANOTHER 2 INCHES OF SNOW
ACCUMULATION POSSIBLE FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
ON FRIDAY AND LINGER THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND...PROMOTING COLDER TEMPS 
AND THE POTENTIAL FOR NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS /PARTICULARLY 
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY/. ON FRIDAY...COLDER AIR WILL SPILL INTO 
THE REGION AS WINDS ALOFT SHIFT TO THE NORTHWEST. THE NAM CONTINUES 
TO SHOW MORE SPOTTY QPF SIGNALS ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY...BEFORE 
EXPANDING THEM FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY AS AS MOISTURE/LIFT RAMPS UP. 
THE GFS IS A LITTLE MORE AGGRESSIVE SHOWING MORE WIDESPREAD AND 
PERSISTENT PRECIPITATION LINGERING THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT AND INTO 
THE DAY ON SUNDAY...MAINLY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS. WITH WESTERLIES AT 
THE SURFACE PREVAILING DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY...THINK THAT 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT SNOW SHOWERS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN MAY BE 
MITIGATED SOMEWHAT...WHILE IN THE VALLEY RAIN SHOWERS WILL BE 
LIKELY GIVEN THE EXPECTED WARMER TEMPERATURES IN THE 40S THERE. 

HOWEVER...AS SURFACE WINDS VEER TO THE NORTHWEST FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY SOME HEAVIER SNOW SHOWERS WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE ALONG 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN...AND TEMPERATURES IN THE VALLEY WILL BE COLD 
ENOUGH TO SUPPORT A DUSTING TO PERHAPS UP TO HALF INCH OF SNOW IN 
SOME SPOTS BY SATURDAY NIGHT AS WELL. WILL PROBABLY NEED TO THINK 
ABOUT A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THE MTNS AND PERHAPS PARTS OF 
FAR NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTH FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY 
MORNING...BUT GIVEN THAT THIS IS STILL 2-3 DAYS OUT AND THE 
UNCERTAINTIES IN THE DURATION OF THE SNOW SHOWERS AND THE TOTAL 
SNOWFALL WILL CERTAINLY HOLD OFF ON ISSUING ANYTHING ATTM. THOUGH 
THE PRECIP SHOULD BE TAPERING OFF BY SUNDAY...IT WILL LIKELY BE A 
VERY COLD DAY WITH HIGHS STRUGGLING TO CLIMB MUCH ABOVE THE MID 30S 
TO THE 40 DEGREE MARK. 

THEREAFTER...A BRIEF WARMUP IS EXPECTED EARLY NEXT WEEK AS AN 
UPPER-RIDGE AXIS SCOOTS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...RETURNING HIGHS 
BACK INTO THE 50S BEFORE THE NEXT STORM SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE AREA 
LATE TUESDAY INTO MIDWEEK. MODELS DIFFER QUITE A BIT WITH THE 
TIMING/TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM SO HAVE REMAINED CAUTIOUS ON ADJUSTING 
POPS TOO MUCH IN THIS PERIOD AND WILL WAIT FOR LATER MODEL RUNS TO 
BETTER DIAGNOSE THIS PART OF THE FORECAST.

.DISCUSSION...UPDATED TO REMOVE CHANCE OF RAIN TODAY...BUT ADDED AREAS
OF DRIZZLE. BROAD UPPER TROUGH REMAINS ACROSS THE WESTERN OHIO
VALLEY. CIRCULATION AROUND THIS LOW WILL KEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW OVER
THE FORECAST AREA WITH WEAK/MODERATE ISENTROPIC LIFT PRODUCING
AREAS OF DRIZZLE THIS AFTERNOON. SKIES WILL REMAIN CLOUDY KEEPING
TEMPERATURES BELOW GUIDANCE. HAVE KEPT PREVIOUS FORECAST OF BELOW
GUIDANCE HIGHS FOR TODAY.

FOR TONIGHT...A SHORT-WAVE WILL ROTATE AROUND UPPER LOW ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. INCREASING WESTERLY FLOW WILL AGAIN ENHANCE
LOW-LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF WAVE...THEN COLD AIR ADVECTION
ALOFT LATER TONIGHT WILL PRODUCE LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY FOR SHOWERS.

COLD AIR ADVECTION OVERNIGHT WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURE PROFILE TO
ALLOW FOR SNOW SHOWERS OVER MUCH OF THE AREA WITH ACCUMULATING

ANOTHER ROUND OF RAIN AND SNOW.  RAIN WILL MIX WITH AND EVEN CHANGE

SHOULD BE LIGHT ENOUGH FOR LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATIONS.  
HOWEVER...MINOR ACCUMULATIONS OF LESS THAN AN INCH IS POSSIBLE OVER 
FAVORED NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES OF THE MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN DECENT

OVERALL. WHILE SOME ENHANCEMENT IS EXPECTED FROM UPSLOPE FLOW THE 
FLOW STARTS OUT A BIT TOO WESTERLY TO BE IDEAL...AND ONCE IT TURNS 
MORE NORTHWEST THE LOW LEVEL FLOW IS EXPECTED TO BE LIGHTER THAN 
IDEAL.  UPSHOT IS WHILE SOME SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS CAN BE

NUMBERS. DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH AT LEAST NOON FOR

CLOUDS AROUND MIDNIGHT. AFTER THE VORT MAX PASSES THROUGH...WE WILL

NOT EXPECTED TO KEEP TEMPERATURES FROM FALLING INTO THE UPPER 20S TO 
MID 30S. MODELS SHOW NEXT SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE REGION WILL BE A 
STACKED LOW THAT WILL SLOWLY EVOLVE OR DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN 
ROCKIES AND SOUTHERN PLAINS SUNDAY THAN PICK UP OLD BOUNDARY NOW IN 
THE GULF AND SPREAD CLOUDS INTO THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY. THE 
PROGRESS OF THE SYSTEM HAS SLOWED AND IT WILL TAKE AWHILE FOR THE 
AIRMASS TO MOISTEN SO NOT MUCH CHANCE OF RAIN UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT. 
DEEP SURFACE LOW AND UPPER LOW MOVES INTO LOWER MS VALLEY MONDAY 
NIGHT AND HEADS ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE GREAT LAKES BY 
TUESDAY EVENING OR WEDNESDAY MORNING. TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT
AROUND THE SYSTEM MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY WILL INCREASE WINDS 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS WITH AT LEAST A 
WIND ADVISORY POSSIBLE. 

BEHIND THE FRONT TEMPERATURES WILL BE COOLER WITH A CHANCE OF SNOW
SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. THE
LARGE UPPER LOW MOVES SLOWLY ENE TO OFF THE EAST COAST BY FRIDAY.
ALSO A DEEPENING UPPER TROUGH FORMS OVER THE EASTERN STATES. THERE
MAY BE A BRIEF BREAK WEDNESDAY BUT WEAK UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS ROTATE
AROUND THE UPPER LOW AND THEN MOVE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE TROUGH
FROM WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE END OF THE EXTENDED. THIS WILL
BRING ON AGAIN OFF AGAIN RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS AS FREEZING LEVELS
STAY LOW. THERE WILL LIKELY BE SOME ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS THE HIGHER
EASTERN TN MOUNTAINS AND EVEN LOWER ELEVATIONS LATE IN THE PERIOD
ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN. HIGHS WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW NORMAL

350 AM EST SAT FEB 23 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ANY LINGERING RAIN WILL EXIT TODAY 
AS A WEAK COLD FRONT PUSHES OUT OF THE AREA. WILL CARRY SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS ALL BUT FAR WEST ZONES FOR EARLY TODAY.  DRIER 
AIR WILL FILTER IN BEHIND THE FRONT...AND CLOUD COVER WILL DECREASE 
WITH A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY EXPECTED BY LATTER HALF OF THE NIGHT ALL 
ZONES. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...APPARENTLY WINTER HAS NO 
INTENTION OF BIDDING FAREWELL AS FEBRUARY FADES INTO MARCH AS COLDER 
AIR SPILLS INTO THE EASTERN STATES LATE IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD 
WHICH BEGINS RATHER PLEASANT WITH QUITE A BIT OF INSOLATION AND NEAR 
TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL HIGH TEMPERATURES ON SUNDAY. SUNDAY'S 
PROTECTIVE RIDGE WILL SLIP GRADUALLY EAST LATER SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THE DAY MONDAY AS A DEEP UPPER LEVEL LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS ENCOURAGING THE FORMATION OF A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY DURING THE SAME TIME FRAME. 
MOISTURE WILL BE LIFTED ISENTROPICALLY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON MONDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN MAINLY SOUTH OF 
INTERSTATE 40. A MUCH BETTER CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY MORNING AS THE SURFACE LOW DRIVES NORTHEAST TOWARD THE 
LOWER OHIO VALLEY DRAGGING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE REGION. SOME 
DRIER AIR WILL EVENTUALLY BUILD IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING STORM SYSTEM 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY ALLOWING FOR A BREAK IN THE ACTION. 
HOWEVER...HIGH LATITUDE BLOCKING WILL KEEP A MEAN UPPER LEVEL 
LOW/TROUGH IN PLACE ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION 
THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. SHORT WAVELENGTH FEATURES 
WILL ROTATE SOUTHEAST AROUND THIS CIRCULATION AND ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH PERIODS OF 
RAIN SHOWERS...MIXED WITH SNOW SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY HIGHER TERRAIN 
AND OVERNIGHT PERIODS AS COLDER AIR BUILDS ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH EJECTING OUT OF THE DEEP DESERT SW LONGWAVE 
TROUGH WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA TONIGHT...INDUCING THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF A WEAK SURFACE LOW ALONG A FRONT THAT HAS STALLED OVER MIDDLE TN. 
THE 12Z NAM IS MOST ENTHUSIASTIC WITH DEVELOPING THIS
LOW...BRINGING A STRIPE OF A HALF INCH OF QPF LATE TONIGHT. THE GFS
SHOWS MEASURABLE PRECIP ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA BUT MUCH LESS
QPF...JUST OVER A TENTH IN MOST SPOTS. GIVEN THE WEAK FORCING
INVOLVED...WILL LEAN TOWARD THE LOWER QPF OF THE GFS...BUT STILL
CARRY CATEGORICAL POPS IN THE EASTERN SECTIONS WITH LIKELY POPS IN
MOST OF THE TN VALLEY AND CHANCE POPS IN THE PLATEAU. BOTH MODELS
AGREE THAT PRECIP WILL BE DECREASING EARLY SATURDAY MORNING WITH
DRY AIR ALOFT BUILDING IN FROM THE SW. BY MID AFTERNOON WE SHOULD
SEE DECREASING CLOUDS AND SOME SUNSHINE...WHICH WILL WARM TEMPS
INTO THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. THIS IS A
BIT COOLER THAN THE TEMPS SHOWN BY MOS GUIDANCE.

THE 18Z NAM HAS SIGNIFICANTLY BACKED OF QPF AMOUNTS FOR
TONIGHT...LENDING CONFIDENCE TO THE LOWER QPF SOLUTION OF THE 12Z
GFS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGHER PRESSURE AND 
WESTERLY FLOW ALOFT KEEPS MOSTLY CLEAR AND DRY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH SUNDAY. A FEW CLOUDS SATURDAY EVENING WILL 
LINGER OVER NE SECTIONS EARLY THEN MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. TEMPERATURES 
NEAR SEASONAL WITH LOWS IN THE 30S AND HIGHS SUNDAY NEAR TO SLIGHTLY 
ABOVE NORMAL. PATTERN BEGINS TO CHANGE SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY AS A 
DEEPENING AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS MOVES INTO 
THE MS VALLEY. WARM AIR ADVECTION AHEAD OF AN ASSOCIATED WARM  FRONT 
WILL SPREAD CLOUDS AND RAIN INTO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY DURING THE 
DAY MONDAY AND THEN THE COLD FRONT WILL FOLLOW MONDAY NIGHT OR EARLY 
TUESDAY. 

AN UPPER LOW DEVELOPS WITH THE SURFACE LOW AND IT MOVES SLOWLY NE 
FROM THE MS VALLEY TO THE GREAT LAKES BY TUESDAY NIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY. THIS KEEPS THE EASTERN STATES IN A MEAN TROUGH AS SEVERAL 
WEAK UPPER LEVEL SYSTEMS WILL ROTATE AROUND THE UPPER LOW WHICH WILL 
FINALLY MOVE INTO THE NE STATES FRIDAY AND KEEP NORTHERN AREAS COOL 
TO COLD AND SHOWERY AND SOUTHERN AREAS PARTLY CLOUDY TO MOSTLY 
CLOUDY WITH A FEW SHOWERS AROUND. THERE WILL BE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
EACH DAY AND NIGHT WITH SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE NORTHERN SECTIONS AND 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE MOUNTAINS. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WARMEST 
MONDAY AHEAD OF THE PRECIPITATION AND FRONTAL SYSTEMS THEN MUCH 
COOLER TUESDAY THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD WITH HIGHS IN

KEEPS PRECIP AT BAY. HOWEVER...AMPLIFYING PLAINS TROUGH SLOWLY

GOOD CHANCE POP FOR RAIN SHOWERS DURING THE DAY MONDAY INCREASING TO 
LIKELY POPS MONDAY NIGHT AS SYSTEM COLD FRONT PINWHEELS AROUND 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LOW PRESSURE CENTER. FORECAST UNCERTAINTY CRANKS 
UP TUESDAY THROUGH THE END OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD AS A DEEP UPPER

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...
MIDLEVEL MOISTURE WILL BE INCREASING THROUGH THE LATE 
AFTERNOON/EVENING...WITH DEEP LIFT FROM UPPER DIVERGENCE AND 
ISENTROPIC UPGLIDE PRODUCING PRECIP AFTER 00Z. WITH DEWPOINTS STILL 
IN THE TEENS IN MANY SPOTS...PRECIP AT THE GROUND MAY BE SLIGHTLY 
DELAYED TO AROUND MIDNIGHT. THE MAIN CONCERN WILL BE THE POTENTIAL 
FOR FREEZING RAIN ALONG OUR EXTREME NE BORDER IN SW VA AND NE TN 
MOUNTAINS. THE GFS HAS THE COOLER TEMPERATURE PROFILE COMPARED TO 
THE NAM. THE GFS APPEARS TO BE IN LINE WITH THE SREF...WHICH ALSO 
SHOWS SOME MODERATE PROBABILITIES OF FZRA IN THIS AREA BETWEEN

IF THE NAM IS FOLLOWED...WE COULD SEE A BORDERLINE HIGH WIND/WIND 
ADVISORY EVENT IN THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS LATE TONIGHT WITH THE

NEAR THE APPALACHIANS LATE FRIDAY ANOTHER IMPULSE WILL MOVE UP FROM

MONDAY NIGHT. THE INITIAL SYSTEM WILL BRING WARM AIR BACK INTO THE

AREA DRY WITH BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS MONDAY. THINK INSTABILITY AND
BEST DYNAMICS WITH THE SYSTEM PRODUCING THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE TO

MIDLEVEL CLOUDS WILL INCREASE THROUGH THE EVENING...WITH RAIN
BEGINNING TO MOVE IN AROUND MIDNIGHT. DRY LOW LEVEL AIR IN PLACE
WILL MEAN VFR VIS AND CIGS FOR A FEW HOURS AFTER PRECIP BEGINS
REACHING THE GROUND. CONSIDERED ADDING LLWS...BUT AT THIS TIME IT
APPEARS THAT THE TOP OF THE WIND SHEAR LAYER WILL BE ABOVE 2000
FT...SO WILL NOT MENTION IN THE TAFS. MVFR CIGS AND VIS MAY DEVELOP
TOWARD SUNRISE...MAINLY AT CHA AND TYS. PRECIP SHOULD BECOME
LIGHTER AROUND THIS TIME AS DRY AIR ALOFT MOVES IN...TURNING TO
DRIZZLE. NORTHEAST WINDS THIS AFTERNOON WILL TURN TO A MORE
SOUTHEASTERLY DIRECTION BY TOMORROW MORNING.

MIDLEVEL CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...WITH A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN MOVING INTO OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES LATE.
WITH SURFACE DEWPOINTS IN THE TEENS...IT WILL TAKE SOME STRONGER
LIFT TO PRODUCE PRECIP AT THE GROUND...WHICH THE MODELS INDICATE
WILL NOT ARRIVE UNTIL AFTER 00Z. THE FASTER GFS APPEARS TO BE TOO
FAST WITH PRECIP OVER WEST TN COMPARED TO CURRENT RADAR AND OBS.
POPS WILL BE LOWERED FROM THE CURRENT HIGH CHANCE TO A LOW OR
SLIGHT CHANCE WEST. TEMPS LOOK TO BE ON TRACK.

349 AM EST THU FEB 21 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL
MOVE EAST OF THE AREA TODAY WITH A DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM ACROSS
THE PLAINS STATES. AS THE RIDGE MOVES EAST...STRONG SOUTHERLY LOW-
LEVEL JET WILL DEVELOP OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AS PRESSURE
GRADIENT TIGHTENS IN RESPONSE TO CYCLO-GENESIS OVER THE SOUTHERN/
CENTRAL PLAINS. IN RESPONSE...ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL INCREASE WITH
MOISTURE SPREADING NORTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA. A LARGE AREA OF
RAIN WILL SPREAD INTO THE REGION THIS EVENING AND CONTINUE
OVERNIGHT. THE BEST ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BE BETWEEN 00-06Z
TONIGHT...SO GREATEST COVERAGE OF RAIN WILL OCCUR THEN. 

INITIALLY SURFACE WILL BE DRY WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE TEENS/SINGLE
DIGITS NORTH. A GOOD DEAL OF EVAPORATIVE COOLING WILL ALLOW THE
SURFACE TO BRIEFLY FALL BELOW FREEZING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. A BRIEF PERIOD OF FREEZING RAIN IS
EXPECTED...POSSIBLY MIXED WITH SLEET FAR NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS.
LITTLE TO NO ICE ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

ANOTHER CONCERN IS STRENGTH OF PRESSURE GRADIENT SOUTHERLY JET OVER
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THIS JET COMBINED WITH FAVORABLE TEMPERATURE
SOUNDING PROFILE WILL SET THE STAGE FOR MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WINDS
FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS/FOOTHILLS. A WIND ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE
NEEDED FOR THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS/FOOTHILLS...
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA STARTING AROUND 06Z
AND CONTINUE TO 15-18Z FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE SYNOPTIC-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND 
REVEAL A PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AFFECTING 
THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...AND A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
AFFECTING THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. A BROAD 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS WILL HELP TO GENERATE A LARGE 
AREA OF CONVECTION OVER THE SOUTHEAST ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT... 
WHICH SHOULD MOSTLY STAY SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
HOWEVER...THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH MOISTURE AND LIFT OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY FOR THIS UPPER TROUGH TO PRODUCE SOME LIGHT SHOWERS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT...AND WILL THEN MOVE NORTHEASTWARD TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION. ALL THE EXTENDED MODELS NOW APPEAR TO BE IN BETTER AGREEMENT 
WITH THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...AND ALL GENERATE A LARGE AREA OF 
CONVECTION OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY AND DEEP SOUTH ON SUNDAY 
NIGHT AND MONDAY. THIS CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY MAY CUT OFF THE FLOW OF 
DEEPER MOISTURE NORTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA...SO THINK THAT 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS ON MONDAY NIGHT COULD BE LIGHT (LESS THAN AN INCH) 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A GOOD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW IS PROGGED TO 
DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY...SO IT 
APPEARS THAT MOST OF THE PRECIP WITH THE SYSTEM OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA SHOULD BE LIQUID. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

930 PM EST WED FEB 20 2013

.DISCUSSION...MINOR UPDATE TO ADJUST TEMPS DOWNWARD. SOME HIGH AND 
MID LEVEL CLOUDS OVERNIGHT. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
A MID-UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL BE OVER THE AREA THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM AS A CLOSED LOW TRACKS NE ACROSS THE PLAINS. HIGH CLOUDS FROM 
THIS SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD ACROSS THE AREA THROUGH THE 
EVENING. SATELLITE SHOWS SOLID CLOUD COVER UPSTREAM TO WEST TX...SO 
WE WILL LIKELY SEE BROKEN TO OVERCAST CONDITIONS THROUGH THURSDAY. 
THIS WILL LIMIT RADIATIONAL COOLING...SO WILL FORECAST LOW TEMPS 
TONIGHT ABOVE MOS GUIDANCE. WE WILL PROBABLY NOT SEE MUCH SUNSHINE 
THURSDAY EITHER...SO WILL HAVE HIGHS A BIT LOWER THAN MOS. THE SREF 
SHOWS SOME LOW PRECIP CHANCES ENTERING THE PLATEAU IN THE 21Z-00Z 
TIME FRAME. WILL INCLUDE A LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP WEST...BUT 
EXPECT THAT PRECIP WILL NOT ARRIVE IN KNOXVILLE UNTIL AFTER 00Z.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR THE THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY SYSTEM
AND THROUGH THE WEEKEND. MODELS BEGIN TO DIFFER ON THE
MONDAY/MONDAY NIGHT SYSTEM REGARDING TIMING AND TEMPS.

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS ON THURSDAY...AND WILL MOVE NORTHEASTWARD THURSDAY 
NIGHT SPREADING SHOWERS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. A LARGE AREA OF 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEY AND DEEP SOUTH ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...WHICH MAY CUT 
OFF THE FLOW OF DEEPER MOISTURE NORTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA. 
THUS...RAINFALL AMOUNTS ON THURSDAY NIGHT MAY BE FAIRLY LIGHT (LESS 
THAN AN INCH) OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A GOOD SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW IS 
PROGGED TO DEVELOP AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY...SO IT APPEARS THAT PRECIP ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WILL 
BE LIQUID. HOWEVER...THERE MAY BE A FEW ISOLATED LOCATIONS ACROSS UPPER 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA THAT COULD SEE PATCHY LIGHT FREEZING 
DRIZZLE FOR AN HOUR OR SO TOWARD SUNRISE. CONFIDENCE IS HIGHER IN 
SEEING ALL LIQUID PRECIP DUE TO SW FLOW SO NOT PLACING FREEZING 
DRIZZLE IN GRIDS...BUT WANTED TO MENTION THE SLIGHT POSSIBILITY OF 
ITS OCCURRENCE. 

AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH THEN AMPLIFIES OVER THE MS RIVER 
VALLEY ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON SATURDAY...WHICH 
WILL HELP TRIGGER ADDITIONAL SHOWERS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 

THE NEXT SYSTEM FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK APPEARS FAIRLY SIMILAR TO THE 
THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY SYSTEM...IN THAT CONVECTION OVER THE DEEP 
SOUTH MAY CUT OFF DEEPER MOISTURE FROM REACHING THE TN RIVER VALLEY. 
THE ECMWF AND CANADIAN MODELS REVEAL A SLOWER EASTWARD PROGRESSION 
WITH THIS SECOND SYSTEM THAN THE GFS MODEL...WHICH WILL RESULT IN A 
WARMER SCENARIO OVER THE FORECAST AREA...RESULTING IN ALL LIQUID 
PRECIP. LATEST GFS CONTINUES TO SHOW FASTER SOLUTION AND KEEPS THE 
TROUGH MORE NEUTRAL OVER OUR AREA AS COMPARED TO ECMWF AND CANADIAN. 
THE NEUTRAL TROUGH ALLOWS FOR A COLDER SOLUTION THAN THE OTHER TWO 
MODELS. FOR NOW...WILL STILL TREND THE FORECAST FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK 
TOWARDS THIS WARMER SOLUTION. WILL SEE HOW THE NEXT FEW LONG RANGE 
MODEL RUNS HANDLE THIS SYSTEM BEFORE JUMPING TOWARD A COLDER GFS 
SOLUTION. BOTH ECMWF AND GFS SHOW SOME INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER 
THE SOUTHERN AREAS ON THE FRONT END OF MONDAY'S SYSTEM. WILL KEEP 
MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS OUT OF GRIDS FOR NOW...WILL MONITOR FUTURE 
RUNS TO SEE HOW INSTABILITY CONTINUES TO DEVELOP.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...
POST-FRONTAL BREEZES WILL CONTINUE BUT DIMINISH DURING THE
EVENING. EXPECT SKIES TO CONTINUE CLEARING QUITE NICELY. COLD AIR
ADVECTING IN WILL RESULT IN BELOW AVERAGE MINS TONIGHT AND MAXES
WEDNESDAY...ROUGHLY 8 TO 10 DEGREES BELOW AVERAGE. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL WILL COME TO AN END BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
THURSDAY MORNING AS OUR NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES. NAM AND GFS ARE IN
GOOD AGREEMENT ON A STRONG UPPER SHORT-WAVE MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS
THE CENTRAL PLAIN STATES LATE IN THE WEEK. AT THIS TIME...MODELS
ALSO IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING OF THE PRECIP ACROSS OUR AREA.
CURRENT RUNS SHOWING BULK OF PRECIP ARRIVING AFTER 00Z. INCREASING
ISENTROPIC LIFT AND FRONTOGENESIS BEGIN TO MOVE IN AROUND THE 00Z
TIMEFRAME. THIS YIELDS A HIGH CONFIDENCE IN POPS FOR THURSDAY
NIGHT. POPS DECREASE FRIDAY MORNING AS LIFT WEAKENS AND MOISTURE
AXIS MOVES EAST.

BECAUSE OF THE NEGATIVE TILT OF THIS SYSTEM...A FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
BECOMES SOMEWHAT SEPARATED FROM THE MAIN LOW OF THURSDAY NIGHT'S 
SYSTEM. THIS WEAK FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA BY LATE FRIDAY/FRIDAY 
NIGHT AND THEN STALLS OUT TO OUR SOUTH AS THE MAIN AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE MOVES OFF ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. KEPT CHANCE POPS DURING 
THIS PERIOD AS FRONT MOVES THROUGH. GFS AND ECMWF SHOW THE FRONT 
STALLING OUT ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES FOR THE WEEKEND. LATEST 
GFS RUN HAS SHIFTED THE BOUNDARY FURTHER SOUTH. THIS BOUNDARY WILL 
HAVE A GREAT IMPACT IN DETERMINING POPS FOR SATURDAY. BECAUSE OF THE 
SOUTHWARD SHIFT...HAVE DECIDED TO REDUCE POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
AREAS FOR SATURDAY. LEFT CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AREAS AT 
THIS TIME. IF LATER RUNS STILL SUPPORT THIS SOUTHWARD SHIFT...POPS 
MAY BE FURTHER REDUCED IN THE FUTURE. A SECONDARY UPPER LEVEL WAVE 
THEN MOVES THOUGH SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...AND INCREASES 
FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING/STRENGTHENING ALONG THE STALLED OUT BOUNDARY. 
IF THE BOUNDARY STAYS SOUTH...AS SUGGESTED BY LATEST GFS...THIS 
KEEPS THE HEAVIER PRECIP TO OUR SOUTH ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES 
AND WILL KEEP US DRIER THROUGH THIS PERIOD. THOUGH...IF THE BOUNDARY 
WERE TO SHIFT BACK NORTH...IT WOULD ALLOW FOR HIGHER POPS ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN AREAS. FOR THIS REASON...WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY 
NIGHT ACROSS A FEW AREAS EVEN THOUGH LATEST GFS RUN IS DRIER.

GFS AND ECMWF SUGGEST DRIER WEATHER RETURNS FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. 
DYNAMICS OF THE NEXT SYSTEM VARY GREATLY BETWEEN THE GFS AND ECMWF. 
HOWEVER...BOTH ARE IN FAIR AGREEMENT ON TIMING. MODELS SHOW NEXT 
SYSTEM ARRIVING LATE MONDAY AND INTO TUESDAY...GIVING US OUR NEXT 
CHANCE OF RAIN.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG A LOUISVILLE TO 
NASHVILLE TO TUPELO LINE...WITH AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF LIGHT TO 
MODERATE RAIN OCCURRING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPS ARE RELATIVELY 
WARM THIS MORNING...WITH MANY SITES REPORTING IN THE 40S. THUS... 
WHILE SOME EVAPORATIVE COOLING WILL LIKELY CAUSE THESE TEMPS TO FALL 
SOME MORE WITH THE RAIN...THINK THAT ANY THREAT FOR WINTRY PRECIP 
OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND SOUTHWEST NC APPEARS TO BE SMALL. WINDS HAVE 
BEEN GUSTY THIS MORNING AHEAD OF THE RAIN...WITH THE CAMP CREEK AND 
COVE MOUNTAIN OBS ALREADY REPORTING WIND GUSTS IN THE 70 TO 75 MPH 
RANGE. THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE HIGH WIND WARNING UNTIL 7 AM FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS AND THEIR ADJACENT FOOTHILLS...BUT WILL CANCEL THE WIND 
ADVISORY SINCE WIND SPEEDS HAVE REMAINED BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. 
GUSTY WESTERLY WINDS ARE EXPECTED TO REDEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON BEHIND 
THE COLD FRONT...BUT IT APPEARS THAT THESE WINDS WILL ALSO REMAIN 
BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA (SUSTAINED WINDS OF 25 MPH OR GREATER). 
OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA INTO 
TONIGHT...WITH TRANQUIL CONDITIONS EXPECTED. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH A STRONG UPPER SHORT-WAVE MOVING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL PLAIN STATES LATE IN THE WEEK WITH INCREASING ISENTROPIC 
LIFT PRODUCING AN AREA OF RAIN FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. A WEAK 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA BY LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. 

GFS AND ECMWF SHOW THE FRONT STALLING OUT ACROSS THE GULF COAST 
STATES FOR NEXT WEEK WITH A GOOD DEAL OF FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING 
STRENGTHENING ALONG THIS BOUNDARY. A GOOD DEAL OF RAINFALL WILL ONCE 
AGAIN MOVES ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT 
LEAST SATURDAY. THE MEDIUM RANGE MODELS SHOW LARGE DIFFERENCES ON 
HOW MUCH PRECIPITATION PULLS NORTH INTO THE AREA OVER THE WEEKEND. 
THE GFS IS MUCH MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH PULLING RAIN BACK INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA AS INVERTED TROUGHING SETS UP ACROSS THE EASTERN 
TENNESSEE VALLEY.

CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON DEGREE OF MOISTURE RETURN...BUT WITH COMPROMISE 
BETWEEN GFS/ECMWF AND BRING POPS BACK UP FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY... 
BUT NOT AS AGGRESSIVE AS THE GFS. DRIER WEATHER RETURNS LATE SUNDAY 
AND SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT ANOTHER SYSTEM IN FOR LATE MONDAY.

ARE LOWER TOO THAN EXPECTED TOO...MAINLY IN THE 20S. THINK LOWS MAY
NOT FALL AS FAR AS IN FORECAST BUT WITH LOWER DEW POINTS LOWS MAY BE
REACHED WHEN RAIN STARTS. HAVE UPDATED GRIDS TO SLOW PROGRESSION OF

BEGINS IN THE NE LATE TONIGHT BUT WARMING ALOFT WITH STRONG LOW

350 PM EST MON FEB 18 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...HEALTHY LOOKING SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH AND SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM ON THE MOVE THROUGH THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LATE THIS AFTERNOON. QUICK SHOT OF RAIN WITH THE 
FRONT LATER TONIGHT WITH TIMING ON THE PLATEAU AROUND 05-06Z AND 
INTO THE HIGH TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER AROUND 08-12Z.
STRONG WARMING HAS OCCURRED ACROSS THE REGION TODAY WITH A NICE 
SOUTHERLY WIND. WARMING WILL CONTINUE ALOFT TONIGHT WITH THE ADVANCE 
OF A STRONG 85H JET WITH SPEEDS AROUND 50-60 KNOTS DUE TO A TIGHT 
LOW LEVEL PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THE MILD CENTRAL U.S. AIRMASS 
AND THE RETREATING MODIFIED ARCTIC AIR. JET POSITIONING ALONG WITH A 
DEVELOPING SURFACE THROUGH 850 MB INVERSION SHOULD AID THE FORMATION 
OF A MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT ALONG THE HIGHER EAST TENNESSEE BORDER 
TERRAIN AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS. UPGRADED HIGH WIND WATCH TO HIGH 
WIND WARNING AND ADDED A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
TERRAIN WHICH WILL BE CLOSER TO THE LOW LEVEL JET. SIGNIFICANT 
WARMING WILL BE OCCURRING TONIGHT ALOFT BUT SURFACE TEMPERATURES MAY 
DROP RAPIDLY ACROSS PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AS WELL AS EXTREME SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. IN THESE 
AREAS TEMPERATURES MAY DIP INTO THE LOWER 30S FOR A SHORT TIME 
BEFORE THE WARMER...MOIST AIR ADVANCES. KEPT A CHANCE FOR A BRIEF 
PERIOD WITH A MIXTURE OF SLEET AND SNOW BEFORE PRECIPITATION CHANGES 
ENTIRELY TO RAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. ALSO ADDED A 
SLIGHT CHANCE FOR MIXED PRECIP ACROSS A PART OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THE RAIN ENDS FROM WEST TO EAST QUICKLY ON 
TUESDAY WITH CLEARING SKIES THROUGH THE DAY. STAYED RELATIVELY CLOSE 
TO GUIDANCE BLEND CONCERNING MIN/MAX TEMPS DURING THE PERIOD.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WINDS WILL SHIFT TO A 
NORTHWEST FLOW AFTER THE FRONTAL PASSAGE ON TUESDAY. THIS WILL ALLOW 
DRIER AIR TO FILTER IN ACROSS THE REGION...THUS PROVIDING CLEARING 
CONDITIONS ON TUESDAY NIGHT. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL PERSIST THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...BRINGING COOLER TEMPS...AS WELL AS CALM AND TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS. THINGS BEGIN TO CHANGE BY THURSDAY AS CLOUDS WILL 
INCREASE ONCE AGAIN AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM 
MOVING FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST. THURSDAY'S 
SYSTEM WILL BE WEAKER AND LESS ORGANIZED THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE DUE 
TO THE EXTREME NEGATIVE TILTING THAT WILL OCCUR BEFORE IT REACHES 
OUR AREA. THE MAIN UPPER LEVEL LOW STAYS WELL TO OUR NORTHWEST 
ALLOWING THE SYSTEM TO BECOME SOMEWHAT DISORGANIZED BY THE TIME IT 
REACHES OUR AREA. THE NEGATIVE TILTING IS DUE TO A BIT OF OMEGA 
BLOCKING THAT WILL BE TAKING PLACE. HOWEVER...THERE WILL STILL BE 
PLENTY ENOUGH LIFT AND MOISTURE TO PRODUCE SHOWERS OVER OUR AREA. 
SHOWERS WILL BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE AREA LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND 
OVERSPREAD THE REGION OVERNIGHT. SOME ISOLATED POCKETS OF SNOW WILL 
BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VA AND FAR 
NORTHEAST TN...BUT TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN ABOVE 
FREEZING AT THE SURFACE IN MOST LOCATIONS. A CHANCE OF RAIN SHOWERS 
WILL LINGER ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. SOUTHWEST FLOW 
PICKS BACK UP AHEAD OF A SECONDARY UPPER-WAVE PROGGED TO MOVE 
THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AND INTO SATURDAY...LIFT AND MOISTURE INCREASE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE WAVE WILL ALLOW FOR ADDITIONAL CHANCES OF 
SHOWERS DURING THIS PERIOD. THEREAFTER...UPPER-RIDGING WILL BRIEFLY 
RETURN ON SUNDAY PROMOTING MILD AND DRY WEATHER. ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL 
SYSTEM APPROACHES SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND GIVES US OUR NEXT 
SHOT OF RAIN.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE EXTENDING ALONG THE SOUTHEASTERN COAST...WITH A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS. THIS LOW IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEASTWARD INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION TODAY... 
BUT IT WILL BRING A COLD FRONT EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
TONIGHT. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS DEVELOP A VERY STRONG 850 MB 
JET (BETWEEN 70 AND 80 KT) ALONG THIS COLD FRONT...WITH A SOUTHERLY 
WIND FLOW AND STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER OCCURRING OVER THE MOUNTAINS. 
THUS...IT APPEARS THAT CONDITIONS WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR THE 
FORMATION OF MOUNTAIN WAVES IN THE FOOTHILLS. IN FACT...THE VERY 
STRONG 850 MB JET MAXIMUM LOCATED NORTHWEST OF THE MOUNTAINS MAY 
ENCOURAGE A HIGH-END WIND EVENT TO OCCUR (WITH WIND GUSTS IN THE 
FOOTHILLS BETWEEN 80 AND 90 MPH). THUS...WILL ISSUE A HIGH WIND 
WATCH FOR TONIGHT ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND THEIR ADJACENT FOOTHILLS. 
ANOTHER POSSIBLE CONCERN FOR TONIGHT INVOLVES THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME 
FREEZING RAIN AND/OR SLEET ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA 
LATE TONIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION 
PATTERN OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH THE 850 MB LAYER 
WARMING ABOVE FREEZING AS A LARGE AREA OF RAIN MOVES INTO THE AREA. 
HOWEVER...COLD AIR (BELOW FREEZING) MAY REMAIN ENTRENCHED IN THE 
VALLEYS OF EXTREME SOUTHWEST NC...SO WILL MENTION A MIX OF RAIN... 
FREEZING RAIN...AND SLEET FOR LATE TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE. WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE WHERE SOME 
SLIGHT DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...PRECIPITATION WILL TAPER OFF 
FROM WEST TO EAST ON TUESDAY AS A COLD FRONT PASSES THROUGH THE 
REGION...SHIFTING SOME BREEZY WINDS TO THE WEST TO NORTHWEST BY THE 
END OF THE DAY. CLEARING CONDITIONS AND A NORTHERLY FLOW WILL ALLOW 
FOR SOME COOLER CONDITIONS HEADING INTO MIDWEEK...WITH LOWS TUESDAY 
NIGHT BOTTOMING OUT IN THE UPPER TEENS TO MID 20S AND HIGHS ONLY 
CLIMBING INTO THE 40S ON WEDNESDAY. BY THURSDAY...CLOUDS WILL 
INCREASE ONCE AGAIN AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM 
MOVING FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST. SHOWERS WILL 
BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE AREA LATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS MOISTURE/LIFT 
INCREASES AND OVERSPREAD THE REGION OVERNIGHT. SOME ISOLATED POCKETS 
OF SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VA 
AND FAR NORTHEAST TN...BUT TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO REMAIN ABOVE 
FREEZING AT THE SURFACE IN MOST LOCATIONS. SOUTHWEST FLOW RAMPS UP 
AHEAD OF A SECONDARY UPPER-WAVE PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH FRIDAY INTO 
FRIDAY NIGHT...BRINGING ADDITIONAL SOLID CHANCES FOR SHOWERS DURING 
THIS PERIOD...ALONG WITH SOME WARMER HIGHS IN THE 50S TO AROUND 60 
DEGREES. THEREAFTER...UPPER-RIDGING WILL BUILD IN FOR THE WEEKEND 
PROMOTING MILD AND DRY WEATHER.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...TRANQUIL AND DRY WEATHER
FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE SHORT TERM AS SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE
MOVE OVER THE REGION. STILL ON THE CHILLY SIDE TONIGHT FOR ERN
AREAS WHERE SURFACE RIDGE AXIS WILL PROVIDE NEAR CALM WINDS. GFS
MOS MINS WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED FOR TONIGHT WITH GFS MAXES QUITE
REACHABLE ON MONDAY...AND ACTUALLY SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL.

MODELS HAVE BACKED OFF ON THE STRENGTH OF THE LOW LEVEL JET MONDAY 
NIGHT AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. ALSO...SOUTHERLY DIRECTION IS SHOWN 
FOR JUST A BRIEF PERIOD FROM 19/06Z TO BARELY 19/12Z...THEN LOW 
LEVEL WINDS VEER TO SW DIRECTION. SINCE THIS IS NOT IDEAL FOR A MTN 
WAVE EVENT...PROBABLY LOOKING A WIND ADVISORY EVENT FOR HIGHER 
TERRAIN AREAS. USED NAM 12KM WINDS WHICH ADVERTISE SPEEDS OF 15 TO 
30 MPH AND GUSTS TO 45 MPH FOR HIGHER TERRAIN OF PLATEAU AND ERN
MTNS. TIMING OF SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE FRONT WAS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS
GRIDS...WITH JUST MINOR ADJUSTMENTS MADE OVERALL. STILL LOOKS LIKE
BEST COVERAGE OF LINGERING SHOWERS TUESDAY WILL BE IN THE 12Z TO
18Z PERIOD.

INCREASING CLOUDS AND STRENGTHENING SOUTHERLY FLOW DOES NOT FAVOR 
THE COOLER GFS MOS MINS AT ALL FOR MONDAY NIGHT...SO STUCK CLOSE TO 
THE MUCH MILDER NAM MOS MINS. BLEND OF MOS CHOSEN FOR HIGHS ON 
TUESDAY. 


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE LONG TERM BEGINS 
WITH DRY ADVECTION AND AN APPROACHING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE. THIS 
PATTERN BRINGS PLEASANT...DRY WEATHER THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
FOLLOWED BY AN INCREASING CHANCE FOR SHOWERS DURING THE DAY THURSDAY 
AS A MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS ACROSS MUCH OF THE EASTERN U.S.
KEPT PROBABILITY FOR SHOWERS IN THE LIKELY CATEGORY THURSDAY NIGHT 
AS DEEP MOISTURE BUILDS AHEAD OF A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY. FORECAST 
UNCERTAINTY INCREASES FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS THE BOUNDARY 
SLIPS ONLY SLOWLY SOUTH WITH WAVES OF LOW PRESSURE RIDING NORTHEAST 
ALONG THE AIR MASS DISCONTINUITY. GRADUALLY TAPERED POPS BACK FRIDAY 
INTO FRIDAY NIGHT FOLLOWING A SCENARIO WHICH ENDS UP WITH THE FRONT 
MOVING FARTHER SOUTH AND EAST THROUGH THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. COASTAL 
PLAIN. THEREFORE...KEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST DRY BUT WILL 
NEED TO MONITOR THIS PERIOD.

TROUGH AND SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM SWEEPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING BRINGING A PERIOD 
OF SHOWERS TO THE REGION. DRY ADVECTION AND RISING HEIGHTS KEEP DRY 
WEATHER IN PLACE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY MORNING. THE NEXT 
UPPER TROUGH SWINGS NORTHEAST FROM THE FOUR CORNERS AREA THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS AND WESTERN LAKES IN NEGATIVE TILT FASHION PUSHING A 
COLD FRONT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY 
PRODUCING ANOTHER PERIOD OF SHOWERS IN THE WARM ADVECTION AREA AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT BEGINNING THURSDAY AFTERNOON WITH CONTINUATION THROUGH 
FRIDAY MORNING. LOOKS LIKE A DRY START TO THE WEEKEND WITH 
TEMPERATURES NEAR NORMAL AS UPPER FLOW STAYS WEST TO SOUTHWESTERLY 
BEHIND THE DEPARTING SYSTEM.

SHOW MUCH OF THE AREA GETTING A MIX OF SUNSHINE AND PERHAPS

.DISCUSSION...MAIN AREA OF PRECIPITATION IS WELL OFF TO OUR EAST 
THIS MORNING...LEAVING CLOUDS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION FOR THE TN 
VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS. THOSE CLOUDS WILL BE STUBBORN TO EXIT 
GIVEN THE CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT. PARTIAL CLEARING OVER WRN PARTS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA WILL LIKELY FILL BACK IN...DUE TO STEEP LAPSE

THERE IS A SLIGHT AMOUNT OF LOW LEVEL POSITIVE CAPE THIS AFTERNOON

UPSLOPE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. THUS...CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK 
FOR TODAY...WITH 20 TO 40 PERCENT POPS SUFFICIENT. FORECAST HIGHS 
NEAR THE 00Z NAM MOS LOOK GOOD AT THIS POINT...SO AN UPDATE OF GRIDS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT ALONG THE CAROLINA COAST...WITH A COOL AND DRY AIR MASS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A BROAD 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WILL AMPLIFY 
OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL BRING A SURGE 
OF COLDER AIR AND GUSTY WINDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...ALONG 
WITH SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS AGREE THAT 
MOISTURE WILL LIMITED ENOUGH FOR ONLY MINOR SNOW ACCUMULATIONS... 
MAINLY IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE UP TO AN INCH APPEARS 
POSSIBLE. THUS...WILL NOT PLAN TO ISSUE ANY ADVISORIES TODAY FOR THE 
MOUNTAINS. THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL QUICKLY SWING EAST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA TONIGHT...WITH A VERY DRY AIR MASS MOVING INTO THE REGION. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
FOR TODAY...BUT REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR TONIGHT. WILL PLAN TO 
TREND TOWARDS THE COOLER NUMBERS THROUGH THE PERIOD...DUE TO THE 
STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED ON 
SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS AN UPPER RIDGE AXIS MOVES OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA. NORTHWEST FLOW WILL KEEP THE COOL AIR IN PLACE ACROSS THE 
REGION DURING THE DAY AS HIGHS WILL PEAK IN THE MID 30S TO MID 
40S...AND WITH CLEARING CONDITIONS LATER THAT NIGHT LOWS WILL PLUNGE 
BACK INTO THE UPPER TEENS AND 20S ONCE AGAIN. WINDS WILL BACK TO THE 
SOUTHWEST AND INCREASE AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING UPPER-TROUGH TO THE 
WEST ON MONDAY...HELPING TO PUSH HIGHS BACK INTO THE 50S TO AROUND 
60 DEGREES...AS WELL AS INCREASE SOME LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE FROM THE 
GULF OF MEXICO. THESE STRONG GRADIENT WINDS WILL INCREASE OVERNIGHT 
MONDAY /ESPECIALLY ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN/ AS A 50-60 KT 850 MB 
JET ROTATES OVER THE REGION. THIS MAY VERY WELL HELP TO CREATE 
ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS ALONG THE MTNS AND FOOTHILLS...AND PERHAPS DOWN 
IN SOME SPOTS IN THE VALLEYS AS WELL. SHOWERS WILL THEN BEGIN TO 
OVERSPREAD THE REGION FROM WEST TO EAST BY LATE MONDAY NIGHT AND 
INTO THE DAY ON TUESDAY AS LIFT INCREASES FROM THE APPROACHING STORM 
SYSTEM AND A COLD FRONT SWEEPS EAST INTO THE AREA. GIVEN THAT 
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO BE ABOVE FREEZING AT THE SURFACE...THIS 
WILL BE AN ALL-RAIN EVENT FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. 
THEREAFTER...ANOTHER PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED BY MIDWEEK AS 
AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS SWINGS OVER THE AREA. HOWEVER...ANOTHER STORM 
SYSTEM SHIFTING FROM THE MISSOURI VALLEY INTO THE GREAT LAKES WILL 
PUSH ANOTHER FRONT INTO THE AREA LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY... 
YIELDING ANOTHER ROUND OF DECENT RAIN CHANCES TO CLOSE OUT THE WORK 
WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...PRECIPITATION WITH THE 
APPROACHING COLD FRONT HAS BEEN RATHER ANEMIC THIS AFTERNOON... 
MUCH MORE IN LINE WITH THE CONSISTENT NAM MODEL. BASING FORECAST ON 
NAM FOR NOW...AS 12Z GFS RUN FLIPPED BACK TO MORE QPF...AND ALSO WAS
AN OUTLIER ON THE SURFACE LOW FOR SATURDAY. SHORTWAVE ENERGY DOES 
DEEPEN THE UPPER TROUGH OVER THE REGION SATURDAY...WHICH SHOULD KEEP 
CLOUDS AROUND AND COLD TEMPS...BUT CAN'T SEE THAT MUCH QPF ACROSS 
WRN NC. HPC WINTER WEATHER DESK ALSO DISCARDED THIS SOLUTION. THUS
I OPTED TO STAY THE COURSE WITH OUR PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR TONIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 

SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES POSSIBLE IN GENERAL WITH THE 
SHORTWAVE ENERGY AND COLD AIR ADVECTION...BUT NOT REALLY SEEING 
STRONG SIGNS OF A NW UPSLOPE EVENT. WIND DIRECTION OFF A BIT PLUS 
LIGHTER SPEEDS...WITH ONLY SIGNIFICANT LOW LEVEL CAPE FOR DAYTIME 
SATURDAY ACROSS SWRN VA. UPPER FLOW REMAINS CYCLONIC UNTIL LATE 
SATURDAY NIGHT...SO KEPT CLOUDS IN THROUGH ABOUT 06Z SUNDAY. DRY 
WITH SUNSHINE FOR SUNDAY AND GFS MOS MAXES WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SHORT WAVE RIDGING KEEPS 
THE START OF THE LONG TERM DRY WITH RAIN BACK IN THE FORECAST MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY WITH LIKELY POPS MONDAY NIGHT WITH THE SYSTEM 
COLD FRONT SWEEPING THROUGH THE REGION DURING THE DAY TUESDAY. DRY 
WESTERLY FLOW AND SLOWLY BUILDING HEIGHTS PROVIDES ANOTHER PLEASANT 
PERIOD OF QUIET WEATHER TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. NEXT 
SHORT WAVE DRIVES NORTHEAST FROM THE DESERT SOUTHWEST INTO THE GREAT 
LAKES THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY DRIVING A COLD FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST 
AREA THURSDAY NIGHT WITH EXIT DURING THE DAY FRIDAY. THUS ANOTHER 
PERIOD OF RAIN WITH LIKELY POPS FOR SHOWERS ENDING OVER MOST OF THE 
REGION BY MID DAY. HAD TO ADJUST MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE...ESPECIALLY 
LATE IN THE LONG TERM...DUE TO FRONTAL PASSAGE TIMING AND EFFECT OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT OVER KENTUCKY AND WEST TN...GENERALLY EXTENDING ALONG A 
LINE FROM LEXINGTON TO NASHVILLE TO MEMPHIS. SATELLITE IMAGERY 
REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS OCCURRING BEHIND THIS COLD FRONT...AS AN 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY. MODELS AGREE 
THAT THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT TO PRODUCE SCATTERED 
RAIN SHOWERS LATE THIS MORNING AND INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS... 
ESPECIALLY OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE 
MOISTURE WILL BE DEEPER. ANOTHER SECONDARY COLD FRONT WILL THEN 
QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...BRINGING DRIER AIR BUT 
WITH SOME LINGERING SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE. IT APPEARS 
RIGHT NOW THAT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED ENOUGH TONIGHT...SO THAT ANY 
SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
ABOVE 2500 FEET WHERE UP TO AN INCH APPEARS POSSIBLE. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND APPEAR REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A SHARP UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL MOVE THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON SATURDAY INTO 
SATURDAY NIGHT...PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL MOISTURE/LIFT FOR A 
NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWER EVENT ALONG THE EAST TENNESSEE 
MTNS...SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND PORTIONS OF THE UPPER/MID VALLEY 
ZONES. MOST ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT...WITH AN 
ADDITIONAL INCH TO PERHAPS TWO INCHES POSSIBLE IN A FEW LOCALIZED 
SPOTS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN. THE MAIN STORY WILL BE THE BITTER 
COLD AIR THAT WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA AS LOWS SATURDAY NIGHT WILL 
LIKELY DROP INTO THE TEENS ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION. 

BY SUNDAY MORNING...ANY LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF AND A 
WARM UP WILL ENSUE AS WINDS VEER TO THE SOUTHWEST AND INCREASE... 
ALONG WITH THICKNESS VALUES AND TEMPERATURES ALOFT...RETURNING HIGHS 
CLOSER TO SEASONABLE LEVELS. MOISTURE WILL ALSO INCREASE AHEAD OF 
ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM THAT WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY. GIVEN THE WARMER TEMPERATURES...ANY PRECIPITATION THAT 
FALLS WILL BE IN THE FORM OF RAIN. YET ANOTHER WARM UP WILL BE IN

SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DIG OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE 
LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY THURSDAY NIGHT...DRIVING A COLD FRONT

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
315 PM EST THU FEB 14 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...A LOVELY DAY OF SUNSHINE 
WILL GIVE WAY TO A GRADUAL INCREASE IN CLOUDS TONIGHT...AHEAD OF A 
YET ANOTHER WEATHER SYSTEM. SHOULD SEE PRECIPITATION SPREADING INTO 
NW PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE MORNING OR EARLY AFTERNOON... 
WITH BEST COVERAGE ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN. TEMPERATURES TOO WARM FOR 
MUCH SNOW ACCUMULATIONS UNTIL FRIDAY EVENING...AND THIS SNOW SHOULD 
BE LIMITED TO OUR TYPICALLY FAVORED HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA...PLUS 
THE NRN AND SMOKY MTNS OF E TN. OPTED TO KEEP A SWATH OF LIKELY POPS 
FOR THOSE FAVORED AREAS FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND ALSO INTO FRIDAY 
EVENING. 12Z GFS MODEL RUN BACKED OFF CONSIDERABLY ON QPF WITH THIS 
SYSTEM...WHICH SEEMS MORE REASONABLE AND IN LINE WITH THE CONSISTENT 
NAM MODEL. 

THE SYNOPTIC SCALE FORCING IS OF SHORT DURATION...WITH MUCH OF THE 
LIFT OCCURRING PRIOR TO TEMP PROFILE COOLING ENUFF TO SUPPORT A 
CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS. THE TOP OF THE MOIST COLUMN DOES COOL TO 
AROUND -10 TO -15 DEGS CELSISUS...COLD ENUFF FOR SOME SNOW GROWTH. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE STILL RUNNING AROUND 0.40 TO 0.50 INCH 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON...THEN DROP TO LESS THAN 0.25 INCH BY 12Z SATURDAY. 
GENERALLY AFTER 06Z SATURDAY...THIS EVENT SHIFTS TO A NW FLOW EVENT 
WITH MOISTURE BECOMING MORE SHALLOW AND LIFT IN THE FORM OF NW LOW 
LEVEL UPSLOPE AND COLD AIR ADVECTION. KEPT SOME CONTINUITY WITH 
PREVIOUS SNOW AMOUNT GRIDS AND THOSE AMOUNTS APPEAR TO BE BELOW
ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR NOW. WILL LET MIDNIGHT SHIFT SEE HOW THINGS
EVOLVE...AND ONLY HIGHLIGHT IN OUR HWO PRODUCT AT THIS TIME.

FOR TEMPS...FOLLOWED THE SIMILAR MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT AND FRIDAY 
NIGHT...AND THE COOLER NAM MOS HIGHS ON FRIDAY. THE COLD AIR 
ADVECTION ON SATURDAY LOOKS MUCH TOO STRONG TO GO ANYWHERE NEAR THE 
GFS MOS FOR HIGH TEMPS. IN FACT...I STAYED A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW THE 
COOLER NAM MOS HIGHS SIMILAR TO PREVIOUS MAX TEMP GRID FOR 
SATURDAY. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THIS PERIOD OF THE 
FORECAST WILL BE ACTIVE WITH AN EXITING SYSTEM ON THE FRONT END WITH 
TWO MORE AMPLIFIED TROUGHS EXPECTED TO PASS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. AFTER AN EXITING AND WEAKENING LIGHT UPSLOPE SNOW 
SHOWER PRODUCING SYSTEM SATURDAY NIGHT THE FORECAST AREA ENJOYS A 36 
HOUR PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER AS UPPER HEIGHTS BUILD AHEAD OF THE NEXT 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH DUE TO IMPACT THE REGION WITH SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY. ANOTHER PERIOD OF MOSTLY QUIET WEATHER WILL ENSUE 
TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MID DAY THURSDAY WHEN THE NEXT DEEP TROUGH 
BUILDS FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST DRIVING A COLD FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY TOWARD THE REGION PRODUCING RAIN SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE 
COLDER AIRMASS THURSDAY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. MADE SOME ADJUSTMENTS 
TO GUIDANCE TEMPS WITH ARCTIC AIRMASS DROPPING INTO THE REGION OVER 
THE WEEKEND WITH A RELATIVELY SLOW EXIT. HOWEVER...TEMPS DO REBOUND 
AHEAD OF THE EARLY WEEK SYSTEM ALLOWING FOR A RAIN EVENT MONDAY 
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. AT THIS TIME...IT APPEARS TEMPERATURES WARM 
SUFFICIENTLY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE SECOND SYSTEM TO KEEP SNOW OUT 
OF THE FORECAST FOR THE THURSDAY SYSTEM.

.DISCUSSION...JUST A FEW POCKETS OF LOW CLOUDS NOTED ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA AT MID MORNING...AND THESE SHOULD DISSIPATE LEAVING 
SOME WELCOMED SUNSHINE! 12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW SOME WEAK WARM AIR 
ADVECTION AT 850 MB LEVEL...WHICH COMBINED WITH SUNSHINE SUPPORTS 
HIGHS IN THE 50S OUTSIDE OF HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. FORECAST GRIDS AND 
PRODUCTS LOOK ON TRACK FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

THIS DRY PERIOD IS RATHER SHORTLIVED AS UPSTREAM SHORTWAVE ENERGY 
QUICKLY HEADS OUR WAY EARLY FRIDAY...CARVING OUT A DEEP UPPER TROUGH 
OVER ERN PART OF THE COUNTRY. MODELS DIFFER ON TIMING AND AMOUNT OF 
MOISTURE AVAILABLE...BUT COULD SEE A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION BY 12Z 
SATURDAY MAINLY OVER HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA...PLUS THE NRN AND 
SMOKY MTNS OF EAST TN. TEMPS LOOK TOO WARM IN MOST AREAS THRU FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON...SO ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL FRIDAY NIGHT IN 
THOSE FAVORED AREAS MENTIONED. COLD AIR ADVECTION...LINGERING LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE AND NW LOW LEVEL WINDS POSE A THREAT OF SNOW SHOWERS 
INTO AT LEAST SATURDAY. PLAN TO EVALUATE THIS SYSTEM MORE IN THE 
AFTN PACKAGE...THEN WILL HIGHLIGHT AS NEEDED IN HWO OR SPS PRODUCT.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW CLOUDS HAVE HELD SO FAR
THIS MORNING ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA AND TEMPERATURES HAVE
NOT DROPPED AS LOW AS EXPECTED YET. NO FOG HAS FORMED BUT THERE MAY
BE SOME EARLY THIS MORNING AS SKIES BECOME MOSTLY CLEAR BEFORE OR
AROUND SUNRISE. HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING IN FROM THE SOUTHWEST
THIS MORNING AND SKIES WILL CLEAR RAPIDLY WITH TEMPERATURES WARMING
INTO THE MID 40S TO MID 50S. SOME MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL
AFFECT NORTHERN SECTIONS AS AN UPPER LOW AND ASSOCIATED LOW
PRESSURE AREA AND SHORTWAVE MOVES BY TO THE NORTH. OVERALL HIGH
PRESSURE WILL PREVAIL TODAY AND EARLY TONIGHT. AN UPPER TROUGH
SINKING SOUTH FROM SOUTHERN CANADA WILL START TO AFFECT THE
NORTHWEST SECTIONS LATER TONIGHT AS A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE AND
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT APPROACHES. CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE
LATE TONIGHT FROM THE NORTHWEST. LOWS STILL EXPECTED TO FALL INTO
THE LOWER TO MID 30S LOWER ELEVATIONS AND 20S IN THE HIGHER
EASTERN MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...PROGRESSIVE PATTERN 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED. A COLD FRONT MOVES EAST THROUGH THE AREA ON 
FRIDAY. MOISTURE SOURCE IS FROM THE NW AND IS LIMITED WITH PWATS 
VALUES RANGING FROM .45 TO .55 NE TO SW. SCATTERED SHOWERS CHANGING 
TO LIGHT SNOW BY FRIDAY EVENING. THIS LIGHT SNOW WILL CONTINUE AS 
UP SLOPE SHOWERS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT WITH LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS...MAINLY ACROSS SW VA AND ELEVATED AREAS OF E TN.  
STRONG POST-FRONTAL COLD AIR ADVECTION GETS UNDERWAY AS LARGE COLD 
SOURCE SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM THE NW. COLD TEMPERATURES 
CONTINUE INTO MONDAY MORNING. RETURN FLOW AND WARM UP BEGINS ON 
MONDAY. UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST ACROSS NORTHERN TIER OF U.S. WITH 
BASE OF TROUGH MOVING THROUGH E TN TUE EVENING. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH TN VALLEY IN ADVANCE OF UPPER TROUGH. GULF OF MEXICO 
MOISTURE WILL BE DRAWN NORTHWARD INTO THE PRE-FRONTAL WARM SECTOR. 
ONGOING CONVECTION CAN BE EXPECTED MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. 
THUNDERSTORMS ARE POSSIBLE. GFS SEEMS A BIT FAST WITH THIS SYSTEM. A 
SOUTHERN ZONAL JET ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH MAY ENHANCE SOUTHERN 
CONVECTION AND STARVE AREA OF DEEP MOISTURE. TOO EARLY TO TELL BUT 
WORTH WATCHING. UP SLOPE SNOW SHOWERS AGAIN POSSIBLE BEHIND FRONT 
TUESDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY) WEST TO NORTHWEST FLOW ACROSS
THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE EXITING
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. THUS...SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE
CONTINUES FROM THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES AND SMOKIES OF EAST TN
NE INTO SW VA. DEW POINT TEMPS REMAIN IN THE 40S EXCEPT FOR NRN
PLATEAU AND EXTREME WRN PARTS OF SW VA...WHERE MID 30S WERE NOTED.
SURFACE AND BOUNDARY LAYER TEMPS LOOK MUCH TOO WARM FOR ANY SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS...IF PRECIPITATION (PCPN) LASTS LONG ENOUGH FOR THE
COLDER AIR TO ARRIVE THIS EVENING. THE DEPTH OF THE MOISTURE DROPS
CONSIDERABLY THIS EVENING AND THE TOP OF THIS MOIST COLUMN IS NOT
REALLY COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW GROWTH (-6 TO -8 DEGS CELSIUS).

THUS...I DID NOT CHANGE PREVIOUS SNOW AMOUNT GRIDS MUCH AT
ALL...SHOWING A FEW TENTHS OF AN INCH IN FAVORED SPOTS OF SW VA AND
NRN MTNS OF E TN. POPS WERE INCREASED OVER NRN AND NERN MOST
COUNTIES WHERE THIS LIGHT PCPN LINGERS LONGEST. OTHERWISE...BLENDED
INTO PREVIOUS POP/WX GRIDS AFTER 15/06Z.

GIVEN CURRENT DEW POINT TEMPS...CLOUDS AND SOME WIND OVERNIGHT... 
FELT IT WAS WISE TO GO JUST ABOVE THE COOLER GFS MOS MINS. DRY AND
WARMER FOR THURSDAY WITH 12Z GFS MAX TEMPS CONSISTENT AND CLOSELY
FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...PROGRESSIVE PATTERN THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE SW THURSDAY

FRIDAY. AVAILABLE MOISTURE LIMITED WITH THIS FRONT WITH SCATTERED 
SHOWERS CHANGING TO LIGHT SNOW FRIDAY EVENING. THIS SNOW WILL 
CONTINUE AS UPSLOPE SHOWERS INTO SATURDAY. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION 
GETS UNDERWAY AS LARGE COLD SOURCE SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS IN FROM THE 
NW. COLD TEMPERATURES CONTINUE INTO MONDAY MORNING. RETURN FLOW AND 
WARM UP BEGINS ON MONDAY. STRONG SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM DEVELOPS AND

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY/...
THIS AFTERNOON...CLOUDS HAVE ALREADY OVERSPREAD THE ENTIRE
AREA...AND SOME LIGHT RAIN IS JUST NOW BEGINNING TO MOVE FROM
NORTHERN ALABAMA/GEORGIA INTO THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE. THIS PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE TO OVERSPREAD THE
REGION THIS EVENING AND OVERNIGHT AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS
THROUGH THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION. AM NOT EXPECTING ANY PARTICULARLY HEAVY RAINFALL WITH THIS
SYSTEM AS THE BEST MOISTURE/LIFT WILL BE DISPLACED TO THE SOUTH AND
EAST OF THE AREA. HOWEVER...GOOD CHANCES FOR MEASURABLE RAIN WILL
BE PRESENT ACROSS THE ENTIRE REGION TONIGHT AND INTO THE DAY
TOMORROW. 

A SECONDARY WAVE OF PRECIP MAY MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES AS
THE BASE OF THE TROUGH MOVES THROUGH TOMORROW...AND LINGER ACROSS
THE NORTHEAST ZONES OVERNIGHT. GIVEN THE COLDER AIR PROGGED TO MOVE
INTO THE REGION BEHIND THE PASSAGE OF THE TROUGH...A CHANGE OVER TO
SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF EAST TENNESSEE AND ACROSS PORTIONS
OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IS EXPECTED AFTER 00Z
THURSDAY. HOWEVER GIVEN THE LIGHT NATURE OF THIS PRECIPITATION...
AM NOT EXPECTING AN ACCUMULATIONS GREATER THAN A DUSTING IN MOST
SPOTS...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN WHICH COULD SEE
BETWEEN HALF AN INCH TO AN INCH BY 12Z THURSDAY. THURSDAY
/VALENTINES DAY/...IS EXPECTED TO BE PLEASANT AND EVEN A BIT WARMER
GIVEN THE PARTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS AND STOUT SOUTHWEST FLOW...WHICH
WILL PUSH HIGHS BACK INTO THE MID TO UPPER 50S.


.LONG TERM /THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...
A BREAK IS EXPECTED BETWEEN SYSTEMS THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY
BEFORE A SHORTWAVE BRINGS THE NEXT CHANCE FOR RAIN LATE FRIDAY
NIGHT AND SATURDAY. GFS HAS CONSISTENTLY BEEN DRIER THAN THE ECMWF
THROUGH THE PAST COUPLE OF RUNS...SO DECIDED TO LEAN MORE TOWARDS
THE ECMWF MODEL. BECAUSE THE MODELS DISAGREE ON PRECIP
CHANCES...CONFIDENCE IS STILL LOW. KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN
THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. PRECIP EXPECTED TO START AS RAIN LATE
FRIDAY AND CHANGE TO SNOW AREA WIDE BY MIDNIGHT. WENT A COUPLE OF
DEGREES COOLER THAN MOS ON TEMPS THROUGH THIS PERIOD. HIGHER
PRESSURE WILL MOVE THROUGH FOR SUNDAY EVENING AND MONDAY...WITH
DRIER WEATHER A SLIGHT WARMING TREND. CONFIDENCE HIGHER WITH THIS
SYSTEM AS MODELS AGREE ON TIMING AND PRECIP CHANCES LATE MONDAY
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. RAIN IS THE MAIN PRECIP EXPECTED...BUT SNOW IS
POSSIBLE IN SW VIRGINIA AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS EARLY TUESDAY
MORNING.

SOUTHWEST BY THE AFTERNOON AS AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM APPROACHES
THE REGION. ACCOMPANYING THIS CLOUD COVER WILL BE SOME RAIN SHOWERS

SOUTHERN ZONES. DO NOT EXPECT ANY PRECIP WILL MAKE IT NORTH OF THE
I-4O CORRIDOR BEFORE 00Z THIS EVENING. GIVEN THE MOSTLY/PARTLY
SUNNY CONDITIONS EXPECTED THROUGH EARLY TO MID AFTERNOON...SOME
DECENT HEATING WILL TAKE PLACE AND ALLOW HIGHS TO REACH THE LOW TO
MID 50S IN MOST AREAS...DESPITE THIS CLOUD COVER AND A PERSISTENT
NORTHEAST FLOW. NO MAJOR CHANGES MADE TO THE FORECAST EXCEPT TO
DECREASE CLOUDS A BIT ACROSS THE NORTHERN/NORTHEAST ZONES AS MOSTLY

.SHORT TERM /TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT/...
CLOUD COVER HAS BEEN SLOW TO DIMINISH THIS AFTERNOON AS A COLD
FRONT GRADUALLY PUSHES ITS WAY INTO THE FORECAST AREA. BEHIND THE
FRONT...DRIER AIR HAS BEGUN TO FILTER IN...ERODING ANY REMAINING
LOW CLOUD COVER AND LIGHT SHOWERS /EXCEPT ACROSS FAR SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE AND THE EAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS/...WHERE SOME LOCALIZED
LIGHT ACTIVITY HAS PERSISTED INTO THE MID AFTERNOON. THINK THAT
THIS LIGHT RAIN WILL END QUICKLY...BUT GIVEN THAT THE NAM CONTINUES
TO SHOW SOME LIGHT QPF SIGNALS ACROSS THE FAR SOUTHERN ZONES
OVERNIGHT AND INTO THE DAY TMRW...HAVE KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP
THERE GIVEN ITS PROXIMITY TO A STALLED OUT FRONT. HOWEVER FOR
MOST LOCATIONS...DRY CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL OVERNIGHT AS PARTIAL
CLEARING MAY EVEN OCCUR /PARTICULARLY NORTH OF THE I-40 CORRIDOR/.

RAIN CHANCES WILL SLOWLY INCREASE BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING
AS AN UPPER-TROUGH PUSHES INTO THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY.
SHOWERS WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT FROM SOUTHWEST TO
NORTHEAST AND SHOULD REMAIN IN THE FORM OF RAIN GIVEN THE WARMER
SURFACE TEMPS IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S. PRECIPITATION WILL
CONTINUE ACROSS THE REGION /FAVORING THE EASTERN HALF OF THE AREA
ON WEDNESDAY/...BEFORE GRADUALLY TAPERING OFF LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT
AS THE BASE OF THE TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH. GIVEN THAT THE GREATEST
MOISTURE/LIFT WILL BE DISPLACED TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE
AREA...AM NOT EXPECTING PRECIPITATION TOTALS TO BE TERRIBLY
IMPRESSIVE. THE PRIMARY CONCERN WILL BE THE COLDER AIR SPILLING
INTO THE REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT...CHANGING OVER ANY LINGERING
RAIN ACROSS THE NORTHEAST AND MOUNTAIN ZONES TO WINTRY
PRECIPITATION...LIKELY IN THE FORM OF SNOW. GIVEN THE MODEST QPF
AMOUNTS...AM EXPECTING THAT VERY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE
/ON THE ORDER OF 1/2 AN INCH OR LESS IN MOST PLACES/ AND CONFINED
TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY/...
MODELS ARE NOT IN AGREEMENT ON TIMING THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
PERIOD...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW. HIGHER PRESSURE MOVES THROUGH THE 
REGION THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. MOISTURE REMAINS ALOFT SO KEPT HIGH 
CLOUDS IN THE FORECAST OVER NORTHERN HALF OF AREA. NEXT SYSTEM 
EXPECTED TO MOVE INTO THE AREA LATE FRIDAY EVENING. PRECIP WILL 
BEGIN AS RAIN...AND CHANGE TO SNOW AREA WIDE SHORTLY AFTER MIDNIGHT 
AS A COLD FRONT BRINGS FREEZING TEMPS TO THE SURFACE. LIGHT 
SNOW SHOWERS COULD LINGER OVERNIGHT INTO SUNDAY AS THE FRONT MOVES 
EAST OF OUR AREA. DUE TO THE MODEL INCONSISTENCIES WITH THIS 
SYSTEM...KEPT POPS LOW CHANCE. WENT A COUPLE OF DEGREES BELOW MOS 
DUE TO THE DEEP TROUGH AND CONSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW. GFS AND ECMWF 
SHOW SLIGHTLY DIFFERENT PATTERNS FOR MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY...BUT 
SEEM TO AGREE ON A SHORTWAVE TROUGH BRINGING THE NEXT CHANCE FOR 
RAIN.

300 PM EST SUN FEB 10 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL 
PUSH INTO THE AREA TONIGHT...AND EXIT DURING EARLY MORNING HOURS 
MONDAY.  AN AREA OF RAIN WILL MOVE THROUGH...AND MAY BE ENOUGH 
ELEVATED INSTABILITY FOR SOME RUMBLES OF THUNDER ESPECIALLY SOUTH 
AND WEST.  WILL GO WITH 100 POPS ALL ZONES...AND MENTION SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF THUNDER ALL BUT NORTHEAST.  RAIN MAY BE HEAVY AT TIMES 
ESPECIALLY SOUTH...SO WILL LEAVE FFA AS IS FOR NOW.  STILL LOOKS 
LIKE MOUNTAIN WAVE WINDS ARE LIKELY IN THE NORMALLY FAVORED AREAS 
GIVEN STRONG SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET AND VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILES. 
WINDS ALREADY GUSTING INTO THE 50S AT COVE MOUNTAIN IN THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAIN NATIONAL PARK. WILL CONTINUE HIGH WIND WARNING AS IS.  
PRECIP WILL QUICKLY EXIT LATE TONIGHT/EARLY MONDAY...WITH DRIER AIR 
MOVING IN BEHIND THE FRONT.    

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... IN WAKE OF THE
FRONTAL SYSTEM THAT WILL DROP THROUGH THE REGION TONIGHT...DRY
CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED BY MONDAY NIGHT AS THE FRONT SAGS SOUTH AND
SOME CLEARING ACTUALLY OCCURS ACROSS THE NORTHERN ZONES. THIS BOUT
OF DRY WEATHER COULD ACTUALLY PERSIST WELL INTO TUESDAY AS MODELS
ARE NOW DELAYING THE NEXT WAVE OF MOISTURE/PRECIP UNTIL TUESDAY
AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SHIFTS INTO THE
LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. SHOWERS ARE AGAIN EXPECTED TO QUICKLY
OVERSPREAD THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT FROM SOUTHWEST TO
NORTHEAST...WITH LIKELY POPS PERSISTING THROUGH WEDNESDAY BEFORE
THE BASE OF THE TROUGH SHIFTS EAST OF THE REGION AFTER 00Z
THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES ARE TRENDING SLIGHTLY WARMER...SO THINK THAT
IT WILL BE AN ALL RAIN EVENT EVEN DURING THE OVERNIGHT
PERIOD...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF A BRIEF CHANGE OVER TO LIGHT SNOW IN
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATE TUESDAY NIGHT.

DRIER AND SLIGHTLY WARMER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED FOR THURSDAY 
/VALENTINES DAY/...AS A SUBTROPICAL RIDGE AXIS BUILDS OVERHEAD. THE 
FORECAST BECOMES A BIT MURKIER THEREAFTER AS MODELS ARE NOT IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING/TRACK OF THE NEXT UPPER-WAVE PROGGED TO MOVE 
IN THIS WEEKEND. SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION MAY BE POSSIBLE LATE 
FRIDAY...BUT THE LATEST TRENDS ARE INDICATING MORE OF A 
SATURDAY/SUNDAY TIMEFRAME. THE PRIMARY CONCERN WILL BE THE COLD AIR 
THAT WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION BY FRIDAY AND WILL LINGER THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND. THIS WOULD SUPPORT A MOSTLY SNOW EVENT. GIVEN THE HIGH 
MODEL SPREAD AND UNCERTAINTY...DID NOT GO TERRIBLY HIGH WITH POPS 
FOR NOW AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE LATEST TRENDS IN THE COMING 
DAYS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE EAST OF THE AREA AND WEAKEN SLIGHTLY TODAY. LOW PRESSURE 
WILL MOVE NE FROM THE UPPER MS RVR VALLEY TO THE W GREAT LAKES BY 
TONIGHT. STRONG PRESSURE GRADIENT SETS UP ACROSS THE TN VALLEY 
TODAY. SOUTHEAST WIND COMPONENT ACROSS THE SMOKIES COUPLED WITH 
STRENGTHENING 850 MB JET ACROSS MIDDLE TN SETS UP GOOD POTENTIAL FOR 
DOWNSLOPING WINDS ACROSS THE WESTERN SLOPES OF THE SW VA/E TN MNTS 
AND FOOTHILLS TODAY AND TONIGHT. A WIND ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED 
ACROSS OTHER AREAS LATER TODAY BUT LOW LEVEL JET MIXING DOWN REMAINS 
QUESTIONABLE. WARM FRONT MOVES NORTH THROUGH THE AREA TODAY. 
PWAT VALUES INCREASE TO 1.00 WITH VALUES APPROACHING 1.50 ACROSS 
SOUTHERN AREAS TONIGHT. INCREASED AND LOWERING CLOUD COVER WITH 
LIGHT RAIN MOVING IN WITH SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT. LAYER MOISTENS UP 
DRAMATICALLY TONIGHT WITH GOOD SET UP FOR WARM RAIN PROCESS. HIGHER 
RAINFALL AMOUNTS EXPECTED ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS OVER RELATIVELY 
MOIST GROUND. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS COULD ALSO ENHANCE RAINFALL 
RATES. COLD FRONT MOVES EAST OF THE AREA EARLY MONDAY. LAYER 
MOISTURE DROPS FAST. BREEZY POST FRONTAL WINDS WILL CONTINUE. ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPERATURES MAY BE ENHANCED ACROSS DOWNSLOPE AREAS THIS 
AFTERNOON. OTHERWISE MAXS COULD BE UNDERDONE PENDING EXTENT OF CLOUD 
LAYER THICKENING. VERY WARM TONIGHT WITH CONTINUED WARM POST FRONTAL 
ON MONDAY WITH WESTERN ORIGIN AIRMASS. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS TRENDING TOWARDS 
SAGGING THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY FURTHER TO OUR SOUTH MONDAY NIGHT BUT 
STILL MAY SEE A FEW SHOWERS MOVE INTO OUR SOUTHERN AREAS THROUGH 
THE NIGHT.  A SHORT WAVE RIDING ALONG THE BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO 
LIFT INTO THE AREA ON TUESDAY...BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS 
INTO THE SOUTHERN MRX CWA.  THE LOW PRESSURE CENTER WILL THEN TRACK 
ACROSS THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY FOR LIKELY POPS.  HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.  THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVES 
IN LATE IN THE PERIOD.  MOISTURE IS LIMITED AND WILL KEEP POPS AT 
SLIGHT CHANCE BUT MUCH COOLER AIR WILL MOVE IN BEHIND THE SYSTEM 
ALLOWING FOR PRECIP TO FALL AS LIGHT SNOW ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA  
BY LATE FRIDAY NIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL RETREAT 
TONIGHT. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL TRACK OUT OF THE PLAINS TOWARD 
THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES REGION ON SUNDAY...PUSHING A COLD FRONT 
TOWARD OUR AREA.  LOW LEVEL JET WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTH ON 
SUNDAY...AND WHILE SET UP DOES NOT LOOK IDEAL AT THIS POINT THERE 
DOES APPEAR TO BE SOME THREAT OF MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WINDS IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN AND FOOTHILLS BY LATE SUNDAY.  WILL ISSUE A HIGH WIND 
WATCH FOR NOW...WITH EITHER A WIND ADVISORY OR WARNING LIKELY TO BE 
ISSUED LATER.  CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT AND SUNDAY AS MOISTURE 
INCREASES.  RAIN WILL START TO MOVE IN SUNDAY AFTERNOON...SO WILL 
HAVE HIGHEST POPS SOUTHWEST ZONES.  

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)... A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL
STORM SYSTEM WILL IMPACT THE REGION EARLY THIS WEEK...BRINGING SOME
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND STRONG GRADIENT WINDS TO THE AREA LATE
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND SUNDAY NIGHT. A BOUNDARY WILL MOVE INTO THE
REGION LATE SUNDAY AND COMBINE WITH A STRONG LOW-LEVEL 850 MB JET
THAT ROTATE OVER THE REGION THAT EVENING... PROVIDING THE LIFT FOR
NUMEROUS SHOWERS IN THE MOIST GULF AIR MASS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD
AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THE PRECIP SHOWING IT MOVING INTO THE
WESTERN ZONES AFTER 18-21Z AND QUICKLY EXPANDING OVER THE ENTIRE
FORECAST AFTER 00Z...BEFORE BEGINNING TO TAPER OFF MONDAY AS THE
BOUNDARY SAGS SOUTH. PWATS ARE RUNNING UP TO 1.5 INCHES ON SUNDAY
NIGHT WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL AND LOCALIZED
FLOODING CONCERNS IN AREAS THAT RECEIVE HEAVIER BURSTS OF RAINFALL
AND EXPERIENCE TRAINING CELLS. HOWEVER...GIVEN THAT THIS SHOULD NOT
BE A LONG DURATION HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT...WITH GENERALLY 1 TO 2.5
INCHES /WITH SOME LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS/...OVER A 12-18 HOUR
PERIOD...AM NOT EXPECTING ANY SIGNIFICANT FLOODING CONCERNS... AND
THUS WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY HYDROLOGICAL WATCHES FOR NOW.

THE MAIN CONCERN SUNDAY NIGHT MAY VERY WELL BE AFOREMENTIONED 
GRADIENT WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 60+ KT LOW-LEVEL JET THAT WILL 
ROTATE OVER THE REGION. THIS MAY LEAD TO ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS IN THE 
VALLEY AND EVEN STRONGER WINDS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND 
FOOTHILLS...WHERE A MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT WILL BE POSSIBLE GIVEN THE 
STRONG SOUTHEAST FLOW AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM. AS A RESULT...WE HAVE 
ISSUED A HIGH WIND WATCH FOR THESE AREAS FROM 20Z ON SUNDAY THROUGH 
09Z MONDAY MORNING. 

WITH THE BOUNDARY SAGGING SOUTH OF THE AREA...PRECIP WILL TAPER OFF 
SIGNIFICANTLY MONDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT...AND SOME CLEARING ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN ZONES MAY EVEN OCCUR. A SECOND UPPER-WAVE WILL THEN 
MOVE TOWARD THE REGION TUESDAY AND BRING INCREASING CHANCES FOR SOME 
SHOWERS TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...BEFORE CLEARING OUT LATER 
THAT NIGHT. AN UPPER-RIDGE WILL PROMOTE PLEASANT CONDITIONS FOR 
THURSDAY /VALENTINES DAY/...BEFORE THE NEXT UPPER-WAVE APPROACHES 
THE REGION FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. WITH COLDER AIR IN PLACE SOME 
SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG WITH SOME RAIN...BUT GIVEN THE 
HIGH MODEL SPREAD ON THE TIMING/TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM HAVE NOT GONE 
ABOVE 20-30 POPS FOR NOW AND WILL WAIT FOR BETTER CONTINUITY.

EVENING. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN OVERNIGHT AND LOW 
AMPLITUDE UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD IN THROUGH SATURDAY.  LINGERING 
CLOUDS SHOULD CLEAR OVERNIGHT...THEN JUST SOME HIGH CLOUDS STARTING

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... A VERY ACTIVE
WEATHER PATTERN WILL ENSUE NEXT WEEK AS A DEEP UPPER-LEVEL LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES
REGION...SHOVING A COLD FRONT SOUTH AND EAST THROUGH THE
OHIO/MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS ON
MONDAY. AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...STRONG SOUTHERLY WINDS SUNDAY WILL
ADVECT SOME DEEP GULF MOISTURE INTO THE AREA. THIS MOISTURE
COMBINED THE LIFT PROVIDED BY THE STRONG 850 MB JET ROTATING OVER
THE REGION AND A PREFRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL YIELD HIGH CHANCES FOR
SHOWERS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL BEGINNING LATE SUNDAY AFTERNOON
AND PICKING UP SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING...BEFORE TAPERING
OFF SOMEWHAT BY MONDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING. MONDAY NIGHT THE COLD
FRONT WILL DROP SOUTH THROUGH THE REGION AND IS PROGGED TO STALL
JUST TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE AREA...PROVIDING SOME ADDITIONAL
CHANCES FOR SHOWERS PRIMARILY ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ZONES ON MONDAY
NIGHT INTO TUESDAY MORNING. WITH PWATS RUNNING OVER ONE INCH...THE
POTENTIAL FOR LOCALIZED FLOODING WILL CERTAINLY BE POSSIBLE SUNDAY
NIGHT INTO MONDAY WITH SLOWER MOVING/TRAINING SHOWERS.
ADDITIONALLY...WITH SOUTHERLY WINDS IN PLAY AND A 60+ KT 850 BB JET
ROTATING OVER THE AREA...THE POTENTIAL FOR ADVISORY LEVEL WINDS IN
THE VALLEY AND HIGH WIND WARNING CRITERIA IN THE MTNS TO BE MET
WILL CERTAINLY EXIST. THIS TREND WILL NEED TO BE CLOSELY MONITORED
IN THE COMING DAYS.

A SECONDARY UPPER-TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO SWING THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY...GIVING THE AREA ANOTHER DECENT SHOT FOR SHOWERS HEADING 
INTO THE MIDDLE OF THE WORK WEEK. COLDER AIR MOVING IN BEHIND THIS 
SYSTEM WILL ALSO YIELD THE POSSIBLY OF A CHANGE OVER TO SNOW IN THE 
COLDER AREAS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN BRIEFLY OVERNIGHT TUESDAY. BY 
WEDNESDAY...CLEARING WILL BEGIN TO TAKE PLACE AS THE TROUGH DEPARTS 
TO THE NORTHEAST AND A BRIEF STINT OF UPPER-RIDGING MOVES OVER THE 
AREA FOR VALENTINES DAY. HOWEVER...ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM MAY BE ON 
THE HORIZON FOR FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND...BRING SOME ADDITIONAL 
PRECIPITATION CHANCES TO CLOSE OUT THE WEEK.

SOUTH WILL MOVE NORTHEAST UP THE EAST COAST. SOME LIGHT RAIN HAS 
MADE IT INTO EASTERN ZONES...AND APPEARS BEST CHANCES FOR PRECIP 
WILL CONTINUE TO BE EAST EARLY TONIGHT BEFORE TAPERING OFF.  WILL 
CARRY LIKELY POPS EAST FOR THIS.  NEXT SHORT WAVE AND A COLD FRONT 
WILL APPROACH LATE TONIGHT AND SWING QUICKLY THROUGH FRIDAY.  WILL 
BRING LIKELY POPS INTO WESTERN ZONES LATE TONIGHT AS THIS SYSTEM 
APPROACHES...AND THEN LIKELY ALL ZONES FRIDAY MORNING BEFORE 
TAPERING POPS OFF FROM WEST TO EAST IN THE AFTERNOON.  APPEARS TEMPS 
WILL BE WARM ENOUGH FOR ALL LIQUID PRECIP IN THE SHORT TERM...AND 
PRECIP AMOUNTS SHOULD BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE.  ONLY MINOR TWEAKS TO 
MAV TEMPS MAINLY TO ADJUST MINS UP SLIGHTLY FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A FAIRLY ACTIVE
PATTERN CONTINUES IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS A COUPLE OF LOW
PRESSURE SYSTEMS WILL BRING PRECIPITATION CHANCES TO THE REGION
HEADING INTO THE EARLY TO MIDDLE PART OF NEXT WEEK.

FOR SATURDAY THOUGH...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD BACK INTO 
THE REGION...PROMOTING SUNNY AND WARM CONDITIONS IN THE MID 50S TO 
AROUND 60 DEGREES IN MOST AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE NORTHEAST AND 
MOUNTAIN ZONES. BY SUNDAY HOWEVER...CLOUDS AND MOISTURE WILL BEGIN 
TO INCREASE AHEAD OF AN UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM MOVING FROM THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES. THIS WILL DRIVE A COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS/TENNESSEE 
VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. A PREFRONTAL TROUGH COULD TRIGGER 
OFF SOME SHOWERS /AND PERHAPS SOME THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS SOUTHEAST 
TN/ SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING...BEFORE A BULK OF THE PRECIP CHANCES 
ARRIVE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY WITH THE FRONT. MODELS THEN INDICATE 
THAT THIS FRONT WILL HANG UP JUST TO THE SOUTH AND EAST OF THE 
AREA...YIELDING SOME ADDITIONAL SOLID CHANCE POPS FOR THE SOUTHERN 
AND EASTERN MOUNTAIN ZONES ON MONDAY...BEFORE THINGS TAPER OFF 
BRIEFLY MONDAY NIGHT. IN ADDITION TO THE RAINFALL CHANCES... 
SOUTHERLY GRADIENT WINDS LOOK TO BE FAIRLY STRONG SUNDAY AND SUNDAY 
NIGHT...SO A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE VALLEYS AND POTENTIALLY A WARNING 
FOR THE MOUNTAINS COULD BE NEEDED...AND THUS WILL CONTINUE TO 
MONITOR. 

THEREAFTER...A SECONDARY UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO MOVE FROM 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THROUGH THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND INTO 
THE AREA ON TUESDAY...BRINGING ADDITIONAL OPPORTUNITIES FOR SHOWERS 
TO MOVE INTO THE REGION STARTING TUESDAY...WITH THE BEST CHANCES 
LIKELY BEING TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...BEFORE RIDGING BUILDS IN 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. GIVEN THE COLDER AIR EXPECTED TO 
FILTER INTO THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY...A CHANGE OVER TO SNOW 
WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR A FEW HOURS DURING

STILL LOOKS LIKE BEST CHANCES FOR LIGHT RAIN WILL BE SOUTH AND
EAST AREAS...SO WILL KEEP HIGHEST POPS IN THOSE AREAS. WILL MAKE
SOME TWEAKS TO POPS...TEMPS...AND DEW POINTS TO BETTER FIT LATEST

646 AM EST THU FEB 7 2013

.AVIATION...LIGHT RAINFALL EXPECTED TODAY AT THE TERMINALS. THE
STRONGER LIFT IS CLOSER TO THE LOW LEVEL PRESSURE CENTER NEAR THE
CENTRAL GULF COAST AND WITH A LOT OF DRY AIR IN PLACE ACROSS EAST
TENNESSEE...IT WILL TAKE A FEW HOURS TO MOISTEN UP THE LOW LEVELS
ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY. THIS FACT AND THE LIGHT NATURE OF THE
PRECIPITATION MAY ALLOW VFR FLIGHT THROUGH MUCH OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. BEST CHANCE OF MVFR CONDITIONS DEVELOPING WILL BE AT CHA
BUT LATER TONIGHT...SURFACE CONDITIONS MAY SATURATE A BIT ALLOWING
FOR SOME FOG FORMATION WHICH MAY DROP VSBY INTO THE MVFR CATEGORY
AT EACH TERMINAL BEGINNING AROUND 04-08Z.

350 AM EST THU FEB 7 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RELATIVELY WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST QUARTER OF THE NATION TODAY WITH EXIT 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN ATLANTIC COAST BY 12Z FRIDAY. MUCH OF THE 
DEEPER MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL BE SOUTH OF THE NORTHERN 
ALABAMA/GEORGIA BORDER. USUALLY GET BURNED TRYING TO KEEP 
PRECIPITATION OUT OF THE GAUGES WITH THESE TYPE OF SYSTEMS. ALTHOUGH 
THE RAIN SHOULD BE LIGHT...THERE IS A BETTER THAN 50/50 CHANCE OF 
GETTING A HUNDREDTH OF AN INCH GENERALLY NORTH AND EAST OF 
INTERSTATES 40 AND 75. THEREFORE INSTEAD OF LOWERING POPS TODAY 
EITHER MAINTAINED SAME NUMBERS OR TWEAKED UP ABOUT 10 PERCENT FROM 
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST. SYSTEM BASICALLY SHIFTS EAST TONIGHT BUT HELD
ONTO TO SOME BETTER PROBABILITIES ALONG THE MOUNTAINS FOR SOME 
TRAILING DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE EXITING 
SYSTEM. THE NEXT SHORT WAVE IS A NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH WITH A COLD 
FRONT NEARING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AROUND 12Z FRIDAY SO ADJUSTED 
POPS A LITTLE HIGHER FOR MORE LIGHT RAIN AFTER AN EVENING LULL IN 
THE ACTION. STAYED IN THE MIDDLE OF TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE DURING THE 
SHORT TERM.   

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
ACROSS THE AREA ON FRIDAY MORNING...THEN DRY AIR ALOFT WILL BUILD IN 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON. ALL PRECIP SHOULD END AREA WIDE BY SUNSET. A 
PERIOD OF COLD ADVECTION WILL DROP TEMPS INTO THE 20S FRIDAY 
NIGHT...BUT A BUILDING HIGH AMPLITUDE RIDGE WILL BRING HIGH TEMPS A 
FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL ON SATURDAY. 

A CLOSED LOW TRACKS NORTHEAST ACROSS THE PLAINS TO THE UPPER GREAT 
LAKES BY MONDAY. A STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL 
BRING INCREASING CLOUDS SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH INCREASING RAIN 
CHANCES ON SUNDAY. THERE APPEARS TO BE GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS 
SYSTEM BETWEEN THE GFS...ECMWF..AND CMC...SHOWING THE BEST PRECIP 
CHANCES WILL BE SUNDAY NIGHT. CLUSTERING OF GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS 
LENDS CONFIDENCE TO RAISE POPS TO CATEGORICAL IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS 
FOR THIS PERIOD. A STRONG LLJ AND GOOD UPPER DIVERGENCE COULD BRING 
A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AND HEAVY RAINFALL...MAINLY IN THE 
SOUTHERN TN VALLEY AND SW NC. WILL ADD A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDER 
SOUTH. 

COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE OCCURS MONDAY...AND IT APPEARS THAT MOST GFS 
ENSEMBLE MEMBERS KEEP THE FRONT TO OUR SOUTH THROUGH TUESDAY. ONLY A 
COUPLE MEMBERS HAVE ANY PRECIP MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...SO WILL 
LOWER POPS TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH. THE GFS AND ECMWF BOTH 
SHOW A SHORTWAVE TROUGH SPREADING PRECIP BACK INTO THE AREA ON 
TUESDAY NIGHT...SO WILL BRING CHANCE POPS BACK IN FOR THAT PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
TRACK WELL TO OUR SOUTH DURING THE PERIOD.  MOISTURE WILL INCREASE 
AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...BUT BETTER LIFT SHOULD STAY TO OUR SOUTH AND 
EAST.  TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR PRECIP TO BE ALL 
LIQUID FOR THE SHORT TERM PERIOD.  WILL SEE INCREASING CLOUDS 
TONIGHT...THEN SOME LIGHT RAIN WILL MOVE IN THURSDAY ESPECIALLY 
SOUTH AND EAST.  WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS NORTHWEST...AND HIGH LIKELY 
TO LOW CAT POPS SOUTH AND EAST ZONES.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.    

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS STILL IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO LIFT NE ACROSS 
FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT WHILE A FAST MOVING NORTHERN STREAM 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH JUST BEHIND IT CONTINUES THE THREAT OF SHOWERS 
THROUGH THE FIRST HALF OF FRIDAY. SURFACE COLD FRONT FOLLOWING 
NORTHERN STREAM FRIDAY WILL USHER IN MUCH DRIER AIR MASS FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT. COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH QUICKLY FRIDAY 
MORNING AND AFTERNOON. HAVE HIGH RAIN CHANCES THURSDAY NIGHT SOUTH 
AND EAST WITH ONLY CHANCE POPS ON FRIDAY. LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT ABOVE 
FREEZING WITH ALL RAIN EXPECTED. FOLLOWED LOWER MAV GUIDANCE FOR 
HIGHS FRIDAY AS COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND SYSTEM ON FRIDAY AND EARLY 
CLOUDS AND RAIN WILL HOLD TEMPERATURES DOWN. 

RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS REGION FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY AND PROVIDE 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. THE NEXT 
SYSTEM WILL SPREAD PRECIP INTO THE AREA SUNDAY. GFS AND ECMWF ARE 
NOT IN GOOD AGREEMENT AS A CLOSED LOW CROSSING THE PLAINS SUNDAY AND 
MOVES INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION MONDAY. THE MODELS BRING THE COLD 
FRONT THROUGH MONDAY BUT STALL THE FRONT TO THE SOUTH THE GFS 
FARTHER SOUTH THAN THE ECMWF SO IT KEEPS RAIN SOUTH UNTIL TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THE ECMWF STALLS THE FRONT JUST TO THE SOUTH BUT OVERRUNNING 
BRINGS STEADY RAIN ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY. WITH COLD FRONT JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA 
TUESDAY...KEPT TEMPS A COUPLE OF DEGREES COOLER THAN GUIDANCE. 
MODELS STILL DISAGREEING ON TIMING OF THE RAIN EXITING THE 
REGION...SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE PRECIP IN THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

TERMINAL WILL RISE OUT OF VLIFR FIRST WITH SURFACE FLOW AT TYS
MODELED CALM FOR A WHILE THIS MORNING. DECIDED TO LET CHA MAINTAIN
THE POOR FLIGHT WEATHER A LITTLE LONGER...RISING TO IFR VSBY AND
VLIFR CEILING AT 1345Z WITH TYS IMPROVING TO IFR VSBY AND LIFR
CEILING AT 13Z. WITHOUT ANY HIGHER CLOUD DECKS IN PLACE WOULD

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A FEW CLOUDS WILL BUILD ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD AS A SHORT WAVE EXITS THE CONTINENT. THERE SHOULD BE A BIT OF 
FOG AS WELL IN SPOTS ACROSS THE VALLEY WHICH SHOULD DISSIPATE FAIRLY 
QUICKLY. SHOULD BE CLEAR SAILING AFTER THAT WITH PLENTY OF SUNSHINE 
AND TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE LATER TONIGHT AS A 
SHORT WAVE MOVES OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. STAYED CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR THE SHORT TERM FORECAST. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH WILL BE LIFTING NE ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY...AND MERGE 
WITH A NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH OVER THE MID-ATLANTIC ON FRIDAY. 
MODELS ARE IN MUCH BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM COMPARED TO 
YESTERDAY. SATURATION OF THE COLUMN WILL OCCUR QUICKLY THURSDAY AS 
ISENTROPIC LIFT STRENGTHENS AND THE JET ENTRANCE REGION MOVES INTO 
THE TN VALLEY. THE NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONT 
FOLLOW CLOSE BEHIND ON THURSDAY NIGHT/EARLY FRIDAY...BUT WITH WEAKER 
LIFT AND LOWER QPF THAN THE SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH. FROPA OCCURS 
AROUND MIDDAY...WITH DRIER AIR BUILDING IN QUICKLY FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

A BUILDING RIDGE ALOFT WILL PROVIDE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPS FOR SATURDAY. HOWEVER...WITH AN INCREASINGLY AMPLIFIED 
PATTERN...THE NEXT SYSTEM WILL SPREAD PRECIP INTO THE AREA ON 
SUNDAY. GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH A CLOSED LOW 
CROSSING THE PLAINS ON SUNDAY AND MOVING INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
BY MONDAY...WITH GOOD CLUSTERING AMONG ENSEMBLE MEMBERS AS WELL. 
WILL BUMP POPS UP TO LIKELY ON SUNDAY NIGHT. THE STRONG LLJ SHOWN BY 
THE GFS SUGGESTS THUNDERSTORMS WITH HEAVY RAIN AND GUSTY WINDS MAY 
BE POSSIBLE...BUT WILL HOLD OFF ON ANY MENTION OF THUNDER FOR NOW. 
FROPA OCCURS ON MONDAY...THEN THE FRONT STALLS TO OUR SOUTH TUESDAY. 
HOW FAR SOUTH REMAINS UNCERTAIN AND DIFFICULT TO DETERMINE THIS FAR 
OUT IN THE FORECAST. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING IN SOUTHERN 
AREAS FOR TUESDAY.

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS STILL SHOW SOME 
VARIABILITY FROM 00Z TO 12Z RUNS ON THE SRN STREAM SYSTEM FOR 
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. NAM MOS POPS WENT FROM AS HIGH AS CATEGORICAL 
FOR THURSDAY ON 00Z RUN TO JUST 15 TO 30 PERCENT ON 12Z RUN TODAY.

THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. SOME LINGERING LIGHT SHOWERS ARE POSSIBLE 
FOR FRIDAY MAINLY WITH THE APPROACH OF A WEAK COLD FRONT. MINOR 
COOLING OF 850 MB TEMPS...BUT SEE NO THREAT OF ANYTHING BUT LIQUID 
PRECIPITATION.

SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE KEEP SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY DRY...BEFORE THE 
NEXT SYSTEM BEGINS TO AFFECT THE REGION. MORE AMPLE SUPPLY OF 
MOISTURE AND STRONGER FORCING COULD POSE A HEAVIER RAIN THREAT...
BUT STILL A GOOD DEAL OF UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING AND TRACK. STAYED 
CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT UNTIL MODELS 
COME TO BETTER AGREEMENT. 

MODELS IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT ABOUT FRONT PASSING THROUGH THE AREA

WAVE ON THE FRONT ON TUESDAY. THUS...MODELS DO NOT AGREE ON TIMING 
OF FRONT EXITING THE AREA. KEPT CHANCE POPS IN THROUGH THE DAY 
TUESDAY IN CASE GFS IS TOO FAST WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE...ALTHO

GULF COAST LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...WITH TIMING NOW SUGGESTING RAIN 
LIKELY CENTERED AROUND FRIDAY MORNING. KEEPING THIS AS AN ALL RAIN

REMAIN IN THE CHANCE RANGE. TRI SOUNDINGS IN THE NAM AND GFS SHOW
AN ABOVE-FREEZING LAYER FROM THE SURFACE TO AROUND 850 MB ALL

ELEVATIONS AND PORTIONS OF SW VA MAY CHANGE TO SNOW LATE
TONIGHT...BUT ANY ACCUMULATION WILL BE LESS THAN 1 INCH.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR
TUESDAY. DYNAMICS WEAK...SO RAIN CHANCES LOW IN THE MORNING. PLENTY
OF LEFT OVER LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE... CONTINUED WET GROUND...WEAK/CALM
WINDS AND CLEARING SKY WILL ALLOW FOR AREAS OF FOG...SOME LOCALLY
DENSE...FOR TUESDAY NIGHT.

FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD...UPPER FLOW BECOMES ZONAL 
WITH A SERIES OF WEAK SOUTHERN AND NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVES 
MOVING ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. MORE SUBSTANTIAL WAVES 
MOVES THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. ISENTROPIF LIFT AND ANOTHER 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL PRODUCE A CHANCE/LIKELY CHANCES OF RAIN. 

NEXT SATURDAY WILL BE DOMINATED BY RIDGING SURFACE AND ALOFT WITH 
DRY AND UNSEASONABLY MILD CONDITIONS. STRENGTHENING SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT WILL ONCE AGAIN SET THE STAGE FOR SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AND 
POSSIBLY FLOODING FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK. WILL HAVE 
TO WATCH THE EVOLUTION OF THE SYSTEM CLOSELY SINCE THE AREA IS 
ALREADY VERY SATURATED.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE CAROLINAS...WITH TEMPS WELL 
ABOVE FREEZING ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
SOME SCATTERED SNOW FLURRIES LINGERING OVER NORTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST VA THIS AFTERNOON...BUT IT APPEARS LIGHT ENOUGH TO END THE 
ADVISORIES IN THESE AREAS. ANOTHER WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS THEN 
PROGGED TO MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON MONDAY... 
BUT THE MODELS AGREE THAT PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT WITH THIS 
SYSTEM AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL. TEMPS ALSO 
APPEAR WARM ENOUGH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH THIS SYSTEM FOR 
MOSTLY RAIN...ALTHOUGH UP TO AN INCH OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS MAY BE 
POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST 
TN. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON 
TUESDAY...BUT A DECREASE IN CLOUDS BEHIND THIS FRONT SHOULD ACTUALLY 
HELP TO CREATE WARMER TEMPS ON TUESDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT... 
BUT ARE THEN IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT. FOR NOW...WILL 
TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO FOR TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE MOVING ACROSS THE 
REGION. A SYSTEM WILL MOVE THROUGH TO OUR SOUTH AS A COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM THE NORTH THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...AND WILL BRING 
A CHANCE OF RAIN INTO THE AREA. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH 
FOR MAINLY RAIN WITH THE EXCEPTION OF SOME SNOW POSSIBLE OVER HIGHER 
TERRAIN. BEHIND THE FRONT...A SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN FOR A RETURN TO 
DRY CONDITIONS ON SATURDAY. A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL SLOWLY 
MOVE THROUGH THE AREA SUNDAY EVENING THROUGH MONDAY...THOUGH MODELS 
NOT IN AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING. HOWEVER...EXPECTING PRECIP CHANCES 
TO INCREASE THROUGH THE PERIOD.

A CHANNELED VORT MAX ACROSS THE UPPER MS VALLEY THIS MORNING WILL 
BRING ANOTHER SHOT OF SNOW TO THE AREA LATER THIS MORNING. WEAK LIFT 
FROM 500 MB PVA AND STEEP LAPSE RATES BENEATH THE MIDLEVEL THERMAL 
TROUGH WILL CROSS THE AREA BETWEEN 12-15Z. AN ADDITIONAL ONE HALF TO 
2 INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE ADVISORY AREAS...SO WILL KEEP THE 
ADVISORY GOING AS IS. SINCE THIS HAS BEEN A 24 HOUR SNOW 
EVENT...WARNING CRITERIA OF 6 INCHES IN 24 HOURS WILL LIKELY NOT BE 
MET OUTSIDE OF THE HIGHEST PEAKS. AFTER 15Z...MIDLEVEL MOISTURE 
DROPS BELOW THE DENDRITE GROWTH ZONE...ENDING MOST OF THE 
ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL. LEANED TOWARD THE COOLER SIDE OF MOS FOR 
TEMPS TODAY DUE TO EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND SNOW COVER IN NORTHERN 
AREAS. SKIES SHOULD CLEAR IN THE EVENING...AND LOW TEMPS TONIGHT 
WILL FALL INTO THE UPPER TEENS NORTH TO MID 20S SOUTH. 

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
FOR THE EXTENDED...THE NORTHWEST FLOW ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF
THE NATION BECOMES ZONAL BY MID-WEEK WITH A WARM-UP ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA. FOR LATE MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...A FAST
MOVING NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM WAVES WILL MOVE ACROSS THE OHIO
VALLEY AND GULF COAST STATES. DYNAMICS FROM THESE SYSTEMS WILL BE
MAINLY NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. GIVEN LIMITED
DYNAMICS...WILL KEEP PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND QPF AMOUNTS LOW.

SURFACE RIDGING WILL AND FAST ZONAL FLOW WILL DOMINAT THE FORECAST 
FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY WITH DRY CONDITIONS.  FOR THURSDAY NIGHT 
AND FRIDAY...A NORTHERN STREAM SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES WITH A TRAILING WEAKENING COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA FRIDAY. DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE LIMITED...SO AGAIN POPS WILL BE 
LOW.

A MUCH STRONGER UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE ROCKIES FOR NEXT 
WEEKEND. THIS SYSTEM WILL BRING MUCH BETTER CHANCES OF RAINFALL FOR

SNOW CONTINUES TO FALL ALONG THE MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE THIS
EVENING AND ACROSS FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA...BUT THE OVERALL TREND THROUGH 06Z WILL BE A DIMINISHING
ONE AS AN UPPER-WAVE EXITS THE FORECAST AREA. SNOWFALL TOTALS HAVE
BEEN FAIRLY IMPRESSIVE IN THESE AREAS...WHERE GENERALLY 2-4 INCHES
HAS BEEN OBSERVED...WITH A FEW POCKETS UP TO 5 INCHES IN THE HIGHER
TERRAIN. WHILE SOME LOCATIONS COULD PICK UP ANOTHER INCH /TO
PERHAPS TWO INCHES IN VERY LOCALIZED AREAS IN THE MOUNTAINS/...
LIGHT SNOW WILL BE THE PREVAILING CONDITION ACROSS THESE AREAS FOR
THE REMAINDER OF THE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT. SINCE TOTALS ARE WELL
WITHIN OUR ADVISORY CRITERIA...AND AM NOT EXPECTING MUCH IN THE
WAY SOME MEANINGFUL ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS TONIGHT...WILL HANG ON
TO THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY THROUGH NOON SUNDAY.

FURTHER TO THE NORTHWEST...THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU HAS
RECEIVED 1-2 INCHES...WITH A FEW LOCATIONS APPROACHING THE 3 INCH
BENCHMARK. AN ADDITIONAL UPPER-WAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA LATE
TONIGHT AND INTO TOMORROW...AND PERHAPS BRING ANOTHER BURST OF
LIGHT SNOW. HOWEVER...MOISTURE PROFILES ARE DEFINITELY NOT AS DEEP
AS WHAT WAS OBSERVED TODAY...SO THINK THAT ANY ACCUMULATIONS
ACROSS THE REGION TOMORROW SHOULD BE FAIRLY MINOR AND LESS THAN ONE
INCH. HOWEVER...EXTREME CAUTION IS URGED FOR MOTORISTS IN THE
ADVISORY AREA WHERE SNOW COVERED/SLICK ROADS HAVE BEEN REPORTED
THIS EVENING.

ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR DETROIT...WITH 
ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY. WARMER TEMPS IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S WERE BEING 
OBSERVED JUST OUTSIDE OF THE FORECAST AREA IN ALMOST ALL 
DIRECTIONS...SO IT APPEARS THAT THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA MAY STILL RISE ABOVE FREEZING THIS AFTERNOON BEFORE THE SUN 
SETS. AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE 
OCCASIONAL LIGHT TO MODERATE PRECIP OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING...WITH THE PREDOMINANT PRECIP TYPE BEING 
SNOW...BUT ALSO SOME RAIN AND SLEET ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE

MORNING...AND WILL NOT CHANGE. IT APPEARS THAT OUTSIDE OF THE

ANOTHER 'CLIPPER' SYSTEM THEN MOVES INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON 
MONDAY NIGHT...BRINGING ANOTHER ROUND OF LIGHT PRECIP. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
MAXES THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT...BUT SHOW SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS. 
FOR NOW...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE COOLER GFS NUMBERS AT NIGHT...DUE 
TO THE EXPECTED SNOW COVER IN MANY AREAS.

STREAM SYSTEM TRACKING THROUGH THE UPPER FLOW WILL BE EXITING THE 
AREA ON TUESDAY. MAIN ENERGY PROGGED TO STAY TO OUR NORTH AND SOUTH

MAINLY RAIN SOUTH AND LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES NORTH. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. MODEL AND RUN 
CONSISTENCY REMAINS POOR FOR THE NEXT SYSTEM. IT SHOULD MOVE IN 
AROUND THE LATE THURSDAY INTO EARLY SATURDAY TIME FRAME. WILL TREND 
THE MAIN BAND OF PRECIP THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. A MIX OF RAIN AND 
SNOW IS EXPECTED OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS BUT TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE 
WARM ENOUGH FOR AN ALL RAIN EVENT IN THE TN VALLEY. ANOTHER SYSTEM 
APPROACHES THE AREA SATURDAY EVENING INTO SUNDAY. EXPECTING PRECIP

AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. MODELS STILL INDICATE 
SOME SURFACE WARMING ABOVE FREEZING THIS AFTERNOON ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS...SO IT WOULD APPEAR THAT THE 
SNOW SHOULD NOT ACCUMULATE MUCH MORE THAN AN INCH IN THESE AREAS.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
309 AM EST SAT FEB 2 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
A SERIES OF WEAKLY AMPLIFIED SHORTWAVE TROUGHS WILL BE MOVING ACROSS 
THE AREA THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD. AN INITIAL DISTURBANCE IS 
CURRENTLY BRINGING INCREASING MIDLEVEL CLOUDS EARLY THIS MORNING. 
THE SECOND WILL BRING SOME STRONGER LIFT AND DEEPER MOISTURE THIS 
AFTERNOON. LIFT WILL BE PRIMARILY DRIVEN BY WEAK 500 MB PVA AND 
850-700 MB CONVERGENCE. PRECIP ONSET WILL BE IN THE 15-18Z TIMEFRAME 
FROM WEST TO EAST...AND TEMPS AT THIS TIME LOOK COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW 
INITIALLY IN ALL LOCATIONS. SREF MEAN SHOWS THE RAIN/SNOW LINE 
GRADUALLY LIFTING NORTHWARD THROUGH THE AFTERNOON...BECOMING 
POSITIONED NEAR MRX AROUND 21Z. NAM AND GFS SOUNDINGS AT TRI SHOW AN 
ALL SNOW EVENT AT TRI...WITH TYS CHANGING TO RAIN IN THE EARLY 
AFTERNOON. CHA SHOULD BEGIN AS SNOW BUT QUICKLY CHANGE TO RAIN WITH 
NO ACCUMULATION. A THIRD DISTURBANCE WILL COME LATE 
TONIGHT...AFFECTING MAINLY NORTHERN AREAS. DRYING AND STABILIZATION 
ALOFT WILL END PRECIP SUNDAY MORNING. 

MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH QPF AMOUNTS. 
THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND NORTHERN TN VALLEY...INCLUDING THE 
TRI-CITIES AREA...ARE EXPECTED TO SEE AMOUNTS IN THE 1-3 INCH RANGE. 
WILL ADD THE TN COUNTIES ALONG THE VA BORDER TO THE ADVISORY AREA. 
SW VA...NE TN MTNS...AND THE SMOKIES WILL BE IN THE 2-4 INCH RANGE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THE DOMINANT UPPER NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BECOME WESTERLY DURING THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD WHICH WILL ALLOW FOR A WARMING TREND NEXT WEEK. DUE 
TO THE FAST AND LESS AMPLIFIED WESTERLY FLOW...SHORTWAVES WILL BE
WEAKER. A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM WAVES WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS AND GULF COAST STATES MONDAY AND TUESDAY. GFS
AND ECMWF THAT THESE WAVES WILL SHOW LITTLE IF ANY PHASING. SINCE
THE ENERGY FOR THESE WAVES GENERALLY STAY NORTH AND SOUTH OF THE
FORECAST AREA...PRECIPITATION CHANCES AND AMOUNTS WILL BE LOW...PER
GOING FORECAST.

SURFACD RIDGING WILL DOMINATE FOR MID-WEEK PRODUCING DRY CONDITIONS. 
A MORE AMPLIFIED NORTHERN STREAM WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
GREAT LAKES FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...BUT BULK OF THE ENERGY AND 
MOISTURE WILL STAY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. ANOTHER SURFACE RIDGE 
BUILDS INTO THE AREA FOR FRIDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
VERY MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS EVENING AS EVERYTHING
LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK. IN WAKE OF A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE...COLDER
AND DRIER AIR HAS FILTERED INTO THE REGION AS A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE
OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AS BUILT INTO THE AREA. THIS STRONG
SUBSIDENCE HAS PROMOTED CLEAR CONDITIONS THIS EVENING AND ALLOWED
TEMPERATURES TO FALL OFF QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET. THE COMBINATION OF
THE CLEAR...CALM AND DRY CONDITIONS WILL ALLOW LOW TEMPERATURES TO
DROP INTO THE MID TEENS TO AROUND 20 DEGREES IN MANY LOCATIONS...
THE COLDEST OF THE WINTER SEASON SO FAR. THE ONE WILD CARD WILL BE
SOME INCREASING MID/HIGH CLOUD COVER FROM THE NORTHWEST FROM AN
UPPER-WAVE THAT WILL IMPACT THE REGION TOMORROW. STILL...GIVEN THE
COLD/DRY AIR IN PLACE AND MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS EXPECTED THROUGH
THE EVENING AND PART OF THE OVERNIGHT PERIOD...THINK THE INHERITED
TEMPERATURE FORECAST WAS ON TRACK.

305 PM EST FRI FEB 1 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE LOWER 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A VERY COLD AND DRY ARCTIC AIR MASS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. IN FACT...IT APPEARS THAT TEMPS TONIGHT COULD BE 
THE COLDEST SO FAR THIS WINTER SEASON. MODELS INDICATE A WARM AIR 
ADVECTION PATTERN DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...AS 
AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL HELP TO GENERATE LIGHT PRECIP OVER THE OHIO 
AND TN RIVER VALLEYS ON SATURDAY...ESPECIALLY DURING THE AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING HOURS. MODELS ARE REVEALING SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH HOW 
WARM THE VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE WILL BE OVER THE FORECAST AREA... 
WHICH IS LIKELY THE RESULT OF DIFFERENCES WITH THE MODELS ABOUT HOW 
MUCH EVAPORATIVE COOLING WILL DEVELOP IN THE DRY LOW-LEVEL AIR. WITH 
THE BULK OF THE PRECIP EXPECTED TO DEVELOP DURING THE AFTERNOON AND 
EARLY EVENING HORUS (WHEN TEMPS WILL LIKELY BE ABOVE FREEZING ACROSS 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA)...THINK THAT ANY APPRECIABLE SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE 
MOUNTAINS...NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND SOUTHWEST VA. 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THEN DEVELOPS OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AXIS MOVES 
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. THUS...EXPECT SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS 
MAINLY OVER THE FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WITH 
ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WINTER WX ADVISORY FOR 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND SATURDAY NIGHT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND THE 
MOUNTAINS OF NORTHEAST TN...WHERE LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF ONE TO 
FOUR INCHES APPEAR POSSIBLE. ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE LOWER 
ELEVATIONS...WARM TEMPS IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER SHOULD LIMIT ANY 
SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS TO AROUND AN INCH OR LESS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS 
AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE EXITS THE AREA ON 
MONDAY AS THE NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES THE AREA. THE INCOMING FRONT 
WILL SPREAD A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW ACROSS THE AREA MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY. A FEW FLURRIES MAY LINGER INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING BUT 
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN DURING THE DAY FOR DRY AND 
WARMER CONDITIONS THROUGH THURSDAY. MODELS DIVERGE BY THE END OF THE 
EXTENDED AND CONFIDENCE LOW BUT WILL HAVE LOW POPS ON FRIDAY FOR THE 
APPROACH OF THE NEXT SYSTEM.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
PROJECTED MOVEMENT OF THE SNOW NOW MOVING THROUGH THE AREA TAKES IT 
TO OUR EAST BY 10Z. IT APPEARS THAT MOST LOCATIONS IN THE ADVISORY 
WILL SEE A DUSTING TO 1 INCH BEFORE THEN. SOME POCKETS UP TO 2 
INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WILL KEEP A LOW TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING AFTER 12Z ACROSS NORTHERN AREAS AND THE 
MOUNTAINS WHERE UPSLOPE WINDS WILL BE FAVORABLE...BUT WITH 
DECREASING MOISTURE ALOFT...LITTLE ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED AFTER 
SUNRISE. WITH TEMPS FALLING INTO THE 20S...ICY ROADS COULD KEEP
CONDITIONS HAZARDOUS DESPITE LIGHT SNOW AMOUNTS...AND SO THE
ADVISORY WILL BE CONTINUED TO 10 AM EST.

OBS ACROSS THE AREA HAVE SHOWN WIND GUSTS IN THE 30-40 MPH RANGE. 
FRONTAL PASSAGE IS EXPECTED AROUND 09Z...WITH WINDS BECOMING 
WESTERLY AND GRADUALLY DECREASING THEREAFTER. THE WIND ADVISORY WILL 
BE CONTINUED UNTIL 6 AM.

AS THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS MOVES TO OUR EAST...WE WILL SEE CLEARING 
THROUGH THE MORNING. DESPITE THE SUNSHINE...COLD ADVECTION WILL KEEP 
TEMPS QUITE COLD...WITH HIGHS FROM THE LOWER 20S NORTH TO MID 30S 
SOUTH. HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE AREA TONIGHT...ALLOWING 
TEMPS TO DROP INTO THE TEENS TO LOWER 20S. SOME INCREASING CLOUDS 
LATE IN THE NIGHT MAY PREVENT TEMPS FROM FALLING FURTHER.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)... 
FOR MOST OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST UPPER FLOW WILL BE NORTHWEST
WITH A SERIES OF FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVES MOVING ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN/CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. FIRST WAVES MOVE THROUGH SATURDAY
AND SUNDAY WITH MODELS SHOWING FAIRLY STRONG ISENTROPIC LIFT. SOME
UPPER JET ENERGY AS WELL AIDING SOME MODERATE FRONTO-GENETIC
FORCING. ALSO...BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW WILL BECOME MORE WEST-NORTHWEST
SUNDAY PRODUCING OROGRAPHIC LIFT INTO THE NORTHEAST MOUNTAINS.

WILL CALL FOR ANOTHER LIGHT SNOWFALL OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT WITH HEAVIER AMOUNTS ACROSS
THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN MOUNTAINS. SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUE FOR THE 
NORTHEAST SECTONS ON SUNDAY WITH LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY AS DEPICTED 
OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON.

ANOTHER QUICK MOVING ALBERTA CLIPPER-LIKE SYSTEM FOR MONDAY NIGHT/
TUESDAY MORNING AND AGAIN TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING...BUT BEST 
DYNAMICS STAYS NORTH OF THE AREA WITH NORTHEAST SECTIONS ONLY 
GETTING BRUSHED.

FOR END OF THE EXTENDED...UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE WESTERLY WITH DRY 
WEATHER UNTIL NEXT WEEKEND.

315 PM EST THU JAN 31 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH A 
COLD AND DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS AGREE THAT A 
SHORT WAVE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL DIVE SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...WHICH WILL QUICKLY PUSH THIS COLD FRONT 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA WITH SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS DEVELOPING 
ALONG AND BEHIND IT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE SOME LOW-LEVEL 
INSTABILITY DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT...WITH 
CAPE VALUES UP TO 50 J/KG. ALTHOUGH THE MODELS DO NOT INDICATE MUCH 
MOISTURE WITH THIS QUICK-MOVING FRONT...THIS LOW-LEVEL INSTABILITY 
SHOULD HELP TO PRODUCE SOME INTENSE SNOWFALL RATES WITH THESE SNOW 
SHOWERS. IN ADDITION...TEMPS IN THE 20S TONIGHT SHOULD HELP TO 
ENSURE THAT ANY SNOW THAT FALLS ACCUMULATES QUICKLY (AND POSSIBLY 
WITH A SNOW-TO-LIQUID RATIO HIGHER THAN THE STANDARD 10:1 RATIO). 
WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL EXPAND THE WINTER WX ADVISORY TO INCLUDE 
ALL OF THE FORECAST AREA EXCEPT THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHEAST TN 
WHERE ANY ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE NO MORE THAN AN INCH. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT WINDS WILL INCREASE AGAIN THIS EVENING WITH THE COLD 
FRONT...SO WILL EXPAND THE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS TO 
CONTINUE THROUGH FRIDAY MORNING. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL THEN 
QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY NIGHT...BRINGING 
ANOTHER QUICK SHOT OF PRECIP. LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS AGAIN 
APPEAR POSSIBLE WITH THIS QUICK-MOVING SYSTEM...MAINLY OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...AND THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND LOOK REASONABLE. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...A FEW POCKETS OF LIGHT SNOW 
WILL LINGER OVER NORTHEASTERN LOCATIONS ON SUNDAY MORNING. 
OTHERWISE...SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. A WEAK 
SYSTEM STILL ON TRACK FOR TUESDAY. MODELS SHOW LITTLE MOISTURE WITH 
THE SYSTEM AND 20 TO 30 POPS SHOULD COVER WITH SNOW NORTH AND RAIN 
SOUTH. A FEW SHOWERS MAY LINGER INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. THE NEXT 
SYSTEM WILL BE APPROACHING THE AREA ON THURSDAY. CURRENT MODELS PUT 
TIMING BEYOND THURSDAY AND WILL LEAVE THE DAY DRY FOR NOW.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LEE TROUGH ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH ANOTHER COLD FRONT 
OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE 
AREA OF CLOUDS OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY AND THE EASTERN HALF OF 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WHICH WILL LIKELY LINGER THROUGH THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS AS THIS NEXT COLD FRONT APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA WITH A 
BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH LINGERING OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS 
UPPER TROUGH MAY HELP TO GENERATE ADDITIONAL SNOW FLURRIES THROUGH 
THE AFTERNOON HOURS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA... 
SO WILL PLAN TO MENTION THIS IN THE UPDATED FORECAST THIS MORNING.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
IN WAKE OF THE THUNDERSTORMS AND HEAVY RAIN THAT MOVED ACROSS THE 
REGION TODAY...SOME MINOR FLOODING IS STILL OCCURRING ALONG SOME 
AREA STREAMS AND RIVERS...PRIMARILY ALONG THE MOUNTAINS AND 
FOOTHILLS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE. SOME LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS ARE ALSO DRIFTING ACROSS THE AREA THANKS TO SOME COLDER
AIR THAT HAS MOVED IN AND THE LINGERING MOISTURE STILL IN PLACE.
HOWEVER... AS MENTIONED THIS PRECIPITATION WILL BE LIGHT WITH VERY
MINOR ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AND PERHAPS UP
TO AN INCH ALONG THE HIGHEST MOUNTAIN PEAKS THROUGH THIS MORNING.
THE MAIN STORY TODAY WILL BE THE PERSISTENT GUSTY WINDS ASSOCIATED
WITH THE PASSAGE OF AN UPPER-TROUGH. A WIND ADVISORY IS STILL IN
EFFECT FOR THE MOUNTAIN ZONES OF EAST TENNESSEE THROUGH 23Z
TODAY...BEFORE THEY FINALLY BEGIN TO RELAX AFTER SUNSET.

THE PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE SHORT-LIVED AS A 
CLIPPER SYSTEM WILL DROP INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FROM THE OHIO 
VALLEY...BRINGING IN ANOTHER SHOT OF COLD AIR. WITH SOME SUBSTANTIAL 
MOISTURE AND LIFT TO WORK WITH...SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS WILL DEVELOP 
AND MOVE ACROSS THE REGION LATE THIS EVENING. WITH SOME APPRECIABLE
LIFT AND SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY...PERIODS OF LIGHT TO MODERATE
SNOW ARE EXPECTED AT TIMES...PARTICULARLY AFTER MIDNIGHT AND ALONG
THE MOUNTAIN ZONES OF EAST TENNESSEE AND THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. SOME LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS OF BETWEEN
1-2 INCHES ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA/FAR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
THE HIGHER FOOTHILLS AND MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE WILL BE
POSSIBLE BY FRIDAY MORNING. THEREFORE HAVE DECIDED TO ISSUE A
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR THOSE AREAS FROM 03Z TONIGHT THROUGH
15Z FRIDAY MORNING. LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG
THE PEAKS OF THE SMOKIES. MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS ARE EXPECTED TO
RECEIVE VERY MINOR ACCUMULATIONS LESS THAN ONE INCH AND WERE NOT
INCLUDED IN THE ADVISORY.

.LONG TERM /FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...
ACTIVE WEATHER PATTERN CONTINUES WITH THE COLDER TEMPERATURES
MAKING FOR SOME ADDED CHALLENGES. GFS...NAM AND ECMWF ARE ALL
ADVERTISING A BIT MORE QPF WITH THE FAST SHORTWAVE TROUGH ON
SATURDAY...WHILE THE SREF AND CANADIAN ARE SHOWING MUCH LIGHTER
QPF. FORECAST SOUNDINGS DON'T FAVOR ALL SNOW EXCEPT FOR SW VA AND
PERHAPS NRN MTNS OF E TN... WHICH ALSO ADDS A GOOD DEAL OF
UNCERTAINTY. HOWEVER...FELT THAT MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION (PCPN) IS
MORE LIKELY NOW ON SATURDAY... SO POPS WERE INCREASED TO LIKELY
ACROSS THE NRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. LATER SHIFTS CAN
DETERMINE IF A SNOW ACCUMULATION THREAT IS JUSTIFIED...WITH 0.5 TO
AROUND 1.0 INCH OF SNOW IN THE GRIDS FOR NOW IN THE FAVORED AREAS.

THE SYSTEM FOR LATE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY IS STILL QUESTIONABLE...
WITH A DRY TREND NOTED IN THE 31/00Z GFS MODEL RUN...WHILE LATEST 
CANADIAN AND ECMWF ARE SUPPORTIVE OF 20 TO 30 PERCENT POPS FOR 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. THESE PERIODS ARE A TARGET FOR IMPROVEMENT

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
315 PM EST WED JAN 30 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH ANOTHER 
SECONDARY COLD FRONT FURTHER WEST OVER THE LOWER OHIO AND WESTERN TN 
RIVER VALLEYS. A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE MS 
RIVER VALLEY WILL SWING EASTWARD OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS 
EVENING...CONTINUING TO GENERATE AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF LIGHT TO 
MODERATE RAIN WITH AN ADDITIONAL INCH OR TWO OF RAINFALL POSSIBLE. 
THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE FLOOD WATCH INTO THIS EVENING...SINCE THIS 
RAIN WILL FALL ON ALREADY SATURATED GROUNDS FROM THE SIGNIFICANT 
RAINFALL EARLIER THIS MONTH. AS FOR THE WIND ADVISORIES AND 
WARNINGS...WIND SPEEDS FROM THE LATEST OBS ARE WELL BELOW ADVISORY 
AND WARNING LEVELS...BUT MODELS INDICATE THAT WINDS WILL INCREASE 
AGAIN THIS EVENING WITH THE SECONDARY FRONT. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS 
THAT WINDS WILL REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA OUTSIDE OF THE 
MOUNTAINS...SO WILL CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORIES AND WARNING FOR 
EVERYWHERE EXCEPT THE MOUNTAINS WHERE A WIND ADVISORY WILL REMAIN IN 
EFFECT THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE 
VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE WILL COOL QUICKLY LATER THIS EVENING...AS THE 
SECONDARY FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...BY THE 
TIME THE RAIN CHANGES TO SNOW...IT APPEARS RIGHT NOW THAT THE BULK 
OF THE MOISTURE WILL HAVE EXITED THE FORECAST AREA WITH ONLY LIGHT 
SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS OF AN INCH OR TWO POSSIBLE IN THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AND LOOK REASONABLE. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...WEATHER DURING THIS PERIOD 
OF THE FORECAST SHOULD BE MORE TYPICAL OF WINTER AS A LONG WAVE 
TROUGH HOLDS ITS POSITION OVER THE EASTERN U.S. AT LEAST A COUPLE OF 
SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION IN THE PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW. THE FIRST 
FEATURE WILL MOVE TOWARD THE AREA SATURDAY MORNING WITH MODELS 
AGREEING IMPACT NOT OCCURRING UNTIL THE AFTERNOON HOURS. LOOKS LIKE 
TEMPERATURES MAY NOT RISE SIGNIFICANTLY ABOVE FREEZING ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS WELL AS THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE BEFORE THE PRECIPITATION 
BEGINS AROUND MID DAY INTO THE AFTERNOON HOURS. THEREFORE...STAYED 
WITH SNOW SHOWERS AS PREDOMINANT PRECIP TYPE IN THESE AREAS WHILE 
MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA MAY BE WARM ENOUGH FOR 
RAIN. THE SHORT WAVE CONTINUES THROUGH THE REGION SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
PRECIPITATION WOULD LIKELY CHANGE TO LIGHT SNOW ACROSS THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THIS TIME FRAME BUT THE SHORT WAVE WILL BE 
MOVING RAPIDLY EAST THROUGH THE NIGHT BRINGING AN END TO ANY FROZEN 
PRECIP ACROSS MUCH OF THE LOWER ELEVATIONS BY MIDNIGHT. KEPT UPSLOPE 
SNOW SHOWERS GOING ACROSS HIGHER TERRAIN OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING WHEN THE LOW 
LEVEL FLOW DRIES OUT. VALLEY LOCATIONS AROUND CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE 
MAY SEE A DUSTING WITH THIS EVENT WHILE LOWER ELEVATIONS ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MAY SEE AMOUNTS AROUND 
ONE INCH. HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS MAINLY OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER COULD SEE AT LEAST A COUPLE INCHES 
WITH THE CLIPPER TYPE SYSTEM. THE FORECAST AREA DRIES OUT COMPLETELY 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH ABOUT MONDAY AFTERNOON WHEN THE NEXT SHORT 
WAVE AND ASSOCIATED FRONTAL SYSTEM BUILD SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE 
REGION. MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT AT THIS TIME SO KEPT POPS 
IN A LOW CHANCE CATEGORY. LOOKS LIKE ENOUGH WARMING AHEAD OF THIS 
SYSTEM FOR PRECIP TO BE MAINLY IN THE FORM OF RAIN BUT MAY END AS 
SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN TUESDAY NIGHT. WAS 
ABLE TO KEEP WEDNESDAY DRY WITH SOME RIDGING BUILDING INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS.

.SHORT TERM /TODAY AND TONIGHT/...
VERY BUSY FORECAST IN THE SHORT TERM AS THE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE
WEATHER WILL EXIST ACROSS THE REGION TODAY...FOLLOWED BY A SHARP
COOL DOWN AND SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL ALONG THE HIGHER
TERRAIN LATER TONIGHT.

A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL
CONTINUE TO TRACK EASTWARD INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TODAY.
AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE
OHIO/TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEYS AND INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION TODAY. ADDITIONALLY...A STRONG 60-70 KT 850 MB JET AND AN
EVEN STRONGER 100-120 KT 500 MB JET WILL ROTATE OVER THE AREA.
THIS STRONG SOUTH/SOUTHWEST FLOW HAS HELPED TO PUSH SOME VERY
WARM/MOIST GULF AIR INTO THE REGION...AS NIGHTTIME TEMPS HAVE
REMAINED IN THE 60S...WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S
IN MANY LOCATIONS. THIS STRONG WIND SHEAR AND JET DYNAMICS...ALONG
WITH THE LIFT PROVIDED FROM THE FRONT WILL COMBINE WITH SOME
INCREASED INSTABILITY THIS MORNING TO PROVIDE THE INGREDIENTS
NECESSARY FOR SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS THE AREA TODAY.

EARLY THIS MORNING...A QLCS CONTINUES TO MARCH EASTWARD ACROSS
WESTERN KENTUCKY AND MIDDLE TENNESSEE MOVING EAST AOA 35-40
KTS...WHICH SHOULD PLACE IT ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AROUND
DAYBREAK...MOVING ACROSS THE AREA DURING THE MORNING/EARLY
AFTERNOON. AHEAD OF THIS SQUALL LINE...SOME ADDITIONAL SCATTERED
SHOWERS HAVE ALSO BEGUN TO DEVELOP ACROSS NORTHEAST ALABAMA AND
MOVE INTO SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. WITH CAPE VALUES INCREASING TO
AROUND 1000 J/KG ACROSS THE VALLEY ALONG THE I-75 CORRIDOR AND WITH
INHIBITION GRADUALLY DECREASING OVERNIGHT...SOME ADDITIONAL
SCATTERED/DISCRETE ACTIVITY WILL BE POSSIBLE AHEAD OF THE
AFOREMENTIONED LINE. GIVEN THE STRONG JET DYNAMICS...THE PRIMARY
THREAT WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM WILL BE DAMAGING WINDS...BOTH
CONVECTIVE /FROM THE THUNDERSTORMS/ AND GRADIENT IN NATURE GIVEN
THE STRONG LOW/MID-LEVEL WINDS ASSOCIATED WITH THIS STORM SYSTEM
THAT WILL TRANSLATE DOWN TO THE SURFACE AFTER SUNRISE. AS A
RESULT...A WIND ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA
THROUGH 9 PM TONIGHT AND A HIGH WIND WARNING FOR THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS OF EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FROM 5 AM TO 7
PM TODAY.

HOWEVER...GIVEN THE STRONG LOW-LEVEL SHEAR AOA 30+ KTS...SOME
BACKED WIND PROFILES NOTED AT KCHA AND KCSV AND PROGGED HELICITY
VALUES OVER 500 M2/S2 THIS MORNING ACROSS THE VALLEY...THE THREAT
FOR ISOLATED TORNADOES CANNOT BE RULED OUT...ESPECIALLY IN SUPERCELL
STRUCTURES THAT MAY DEVELOP JUST AHEAD OF OR EMBEDDED IN THE LINE.
ADDITIONALLY...SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE WITH
QPF VALUES BETWEEN 1 TO 1.5 INCHES EXPECTED OVER MOST OF THE
FORECAST AREA.

LATER TONIGHT BEHIND THE FRONT...COLDER AIR WILL FILTER INTO THE
AREA...CHANGING ANY LINGERING RAIN SHOWERS OVER TO SNOW SHOWERS
OVER THE MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST ZONES. ANY ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE
LIGHT AND MAINLY CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HOWEVER...SOME
PEAKS ALONG THE SMOKIES COULD GET UP TO 2 INCHES BY DAYBREAK. 

.LONG TERM /THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY/...
STILL A RATHER UNSETTLED PATTERN FOR THE LONG TERM. AN UPPER
TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE NE STATES THURSDAY NIGHT AND
FRIDAY...PUSHING SOME COLDER AIR INTO THE SRN APPALACHIANS. PATTERN
SUPPORTS SOME UPSLOPE SNOWFALL FOR FAVORED PARTS OF SW VA AND NRN
MTNS DOWN TO THE SMOKIES AT LEAST. BEST PERIOD FOR SOME LIGHT SNOW
ACCUMULATION LOOKS TO BE 06Z TO 15Z FRIDAY...WITH NW LOW LEVEL
WINDS MAINLY FOR SW VA AND NRN MTNS PLUS DECENT LOW LEVEL CAPES OF
50 TO 100 J/KG. SOUNDINGS...ESPECIALLY NAM...SHOW SUFFICIENT
MOISTURE AND ABOUT -20 DEGS C AT THE TOP OF THE MOIST COLUMN.
HOWEVER...EVEN NAM SOUNDINGS SHOW THIS MOISTURE TO BE VERY SHALLOW
BY 15Z FRIDAY AND VIRTUALLY NO CAPE BY EARLY FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
PREVIOUS GRIDS HAD LIGHT SNOW AMOUNTS FOR THESE AREAS... SO MAIN
ADJUSTMENT WAS TO NUDGE POPS UP TO LIKELY. STAYED WITH CHANCE POPS
ELSEWHERE IN LINE WITH A MOS BLEND. KNOCKED FRIDAY MAX TEMPS DOWN
BY SEVERAL DEGREES...QUITE CLOSE TO GFS MOS.

OTHERWISE...NEXT SYSTEM OF ANY SIGNIFICANCE APPEARS TO BE LATE 
SATURDAY INTO SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE DROPPING 
ESE OUT OF THE MID MS VALLEY REGION. NOT SURE IF THIS ONE HAS ENOUGH 
MOISTURE TO GENERATE A LOT OF PRECIPITATION...PLUS SRN HALF OF THE 
AREA LOOKS WARM ENUFF FOR RAIN AND NRN AREAS COLD ENUFF FOR SNOW OR 
A MIX. THUS...WILL LET DAY SHIFT EXAMINE THIS AGAIN. 

ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND SURFACE RIDGE KEEP SUNDAY INTO EARLY MONDAY 
DRY. KEPT POPS IN FOR LATE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY FOR AN APPROACHING 
COLD FRONT...WITH GFS AND ECMWF SIMILAR AND IN LINE WITH THESE 
GRIDS. TEMPS WERE GENERALLY NUDGED DOWNWARD MOST DAYS IN LINE WITH 
30/00Z GFSX MOS TEMPS.

944 PM EST TUE JAN 29 2013

.DISCUSSION...
FOR TONIGHT...LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS OVER NE GA AND UPSTATE SC ARE
SPREADING NORTHWARD...ASSOCIATED WITH AN AREA OF ISENTROPIC LIFT.
SOME ADDITIONAL SHOWERS AHEAD OF THE MAIN CONVECTIVE LINE MAY BEGIN
TO AFFECT THE PLATEAU COUNTIES IN THE 11-13Z TIMEFRAME. WILL NOT
MAKE ANY CHANGES TO POP OR WX GRIDS. TEMPERATURES MAY NEED SOME
SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS AS CURRENT OBS ARE BELOW FORECAST. WINDS SPEED
OBS ACROSS THE AREA ARE GRADUALLY INCREASING...AND THE CURRENT
WIND ADVISORY AND HIGH WIND WARNING AREAS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK AND
WILL NOT BE CHANGED.

CURRENT PROJECTED TIMING OF THE MAIN CONVECTIVE LINE BRINGS IT
THROUGH THE TN VALLEY AREA BETWEEN 14-18Z. THIS IS MORE IN LINE
WITH THE FASTER TIMING OF THE GFS. THE NAM HAS BEEN SLOWER IN THE
12Z AND 18Z MODEL RUNS...AND IT STILL APPEARS SLOWER WITH ITS 00Z
RUN. THE 00Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS AN ELEVATED MIXED LAYER BETWEEN
800-500 MB...WHICH WILL SUPPLY SOME INSTABILITY. WHILE SHEAR IS
STRONG...IT IS MAINLY UNIDIRECTIONAL...SUGGESTING LINEAR STORMS
WITH THE MAIN THREAT BEING STRAIGHT-LINE DAMAGING WINDS. A LOW
TORNADO THREAT MAY EXIST IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WHERE SURFACE WINDS
WILL BE A BIT MORE BACKED TO PROVIDE DIRECTIONAL SHEAR.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...STRONG SYSTEM HEADED THIS
WAY. HAVE WIND ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS STARTING TONIGHT AND GOING
THROUGH WEDNESDAY. GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES LOOKED GOOD...ONLY WARMED
UP NE FOR LOWS TONIGHT A FEW DEGREES. WILL HAVE WIDESPREAD
CONVECTION ALONG AND AHEAD OF FRONT ON WEDNESDAY. THUNDER IS
SOMEWHAT OF A QUESTION...BUT HAVE SHOWERS WITH A CHANCE OF STORMS
AS THE WORDING. MAIN SEVERE THREAT IS HEAVILY WEIGHTED TOWARD
DAMAGING WINDS. AS MENTIONED BEFORE THUNDER MAY BE A QUESTION...BUT
EVEN WEAK DOWNDRAFTS IN SHOWERS WILL BE ABLE TO BRING ADDITIONAL
MOMENTUM DOWN TO THE GROUND...ENHANCING DAMAGE POTENTIAL. RAINS
WILL BE HEAVY AT TIMES...BUT CONSIDERING EXPECTED AMOUNTS AND FLASH
FLOOD GUIDANCE HAVE DECIDED NOT TO ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR ANY PART
OF THE AREA. QPF TOTALS RANGE FROM A LITTLE OVER AN INCH ON THE
PLATEAU TO 1.50 TO 2.00 IN SW NORTH CAROLINA. NORTHEASTERN AREAS
ARE IN THE 1.00 TO 1.50 INCH RANGE. THINK MAIN CONVECTIVE LINE WILL
RACE THROUGH THE AREA...ENTERING THE AREA ROUGHLY 12-13Z...AND
EXITING THE AREA ROUGHLY 18-19Z. SHOWERS WILL BE DEVELOPING AHEAD
OF THE MAIN LINE...AND LINGERING STRATOFORM RAINS WILL SLOWLY
FOLLOW THE CONVECTIVE LINE.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SHOWERS WILL TAPER 
OFF AND END WEDNESDAY NIGHT/EARLY THURSDAY...BUT WITH COLDER AIR 
MOVING IN MAY SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS BEFORE THE PRECIP ENDS. LOOKS 
LIKE ANY SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL BE FAIRLY BRIEF AND DOES NOT LOOK 
LIKE A GOOD SET UP FOR UPSLOPE COLD ADVECTION SNOW...BUT STILL COULD 
SEE SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  WILL MENTION 
IN HWO.  A FAST MOVING WEAK SHORT WAVE WILL SWING ACROSS THE REGION 
THURSDAY NIGHT ALONG WITH A COLD FRONT.  MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED 
WITH THIS SYSTEM...BUT APPEARS THERE COULD BE SOME LIGHT SNOW 
ESPECIALLY NORTHERN HALF FOR A FEW HOURS DURING THE NIGHT.  SINCE IT 
WILL BE QUITE COLD...THERE IS THE AT LEAST SOME POTENTIAL FOR MINOR 
ACCUMULATIONS WITH THIS SYSTEM...MAINLY NORTHERN HALF...ALTHOUGH 
STILL CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH MOISTURE WILL BE 
AVAILABLE.  FOR NOW WILL JUST BEEF POPS UP AS HIGH AS HIGH CHANCE 
NORTH FOR THURSDAY NIGHT.  THERE MAY BE YET ANOTHER FAST MOVING WEAK 
SYSTEM FOR SATURDAY...ALTHOUGH MODEL HANDLING OF THIS HAS BEEN 
INCONSISTENT SO FORECAST CONFIDENCE IS LOW...AND FORECAST CONFIDENCE 
CONTINUES TO BE ON THE LOW SIDE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD.  WHILE TIMING IS UNCERTAIN...A MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM MAY 
BRING MAINLY RAIN FOR MONDAY INTO TUESDAY.

TORNADO. OTHERWISE...MILD TEMPS AGAIN TONIGHT WITH MAX TEMPS
OCCURRING WEDNESDAY MORNING THEN FALLING IN THE AFTERNOON.


.LONG TERM.../WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
IN WAKE OF THE COLD FRONT/STORMS THAT WILL PASS THROUGH THE REGION 
ON WEDNESDAY...A COLDER AIRMASS WILL FILTER INTO THE AREA. THIS 
WILL RESULT IN LINGERING RAIN SHOWERS CHANGING OVER TO SNOW SHOWERS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...WITH SOME MINOR ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE ALONG THE PEAKS. 
WINDS WILL GRADUALLY BE TAPERING OFF WEDNESDAY EVENING...SO WILL 
ALLOW THE HIGH WIND WATCH TO EXPIRE AT 00Z. HOWEVER...SOME 
BREEZY/GUSTY GRADIENT WINDS WILL BE POSSIBLE OVERNIGHT. 

A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES WILL BE THE 
PREDOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE ACROSS THE EASTERN CONUS FOR THE 
REMAINDER OF THE WEEK AND WEEKEND...WITH A FEW UPPERWAVES/FRONTS 
PASSING THROUGH THE REGION DURING THIS TIME. SOME BRIEF CLEARING 
WILL OCCUR ON THURSDAY BEFORE INCREASING CLOUDS DEVELOP QUICKLY 
AFTER SUNSET AS THE FIRST OF THESE FRONTS PASSES THROUGH THE AREA. 
WITH MOISTURE INCREASING ACROSS THE REGION WITH THE PASSING OF THIS 
WAVE THURSDAY NIGHT...AND THE COLDER AIR IN PLACE...SNOW SHOWERS ARE 
EXPECTED ACROSS THE REGION ONCE AGAIN...BEFORE TAPERING OFF BY 
FRIDAY MORNING /EXCEPT ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND THE NORTHEAST 
ZONES...WHERE THEY COULD LINGER INTO FRIDAY/. ANOTHER PERIOD OF 
BRIEF CLEARING IS EXPECTED FRIDAY NIGHT...BEFORE THE NEXT UPPERWAVE 
WILL BRING SOME ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR PRECIPITATION SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING...WITH SNOW SHOWERS LIKELY ONCE 
AGAIN AFTER SUNSET AS COLDER AIR FILTERS IN BEHIND THE FRONT. 

A WARM UP IS THEN EXPECTED FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS HIGHS WARM BACK 
INTO THE 50S AS UPPER-RIDGING BUILDS BACK INTO THE SOUTHEAST. 
HOWEVER...ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM MAY BE ON THE HORIZON FOR THE MONDAY 
NIGHT/TUESDAY TIME PERIOD...WITH ADDITIONAL CHANCES FOR 
PRECIPITATION POSSIBLE HEADING INTO THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK.

MINIMAL POPS NORTH TONIGHT...AND ONLY CHANCE OF SPRINKLES SOUTH 
TUESDAY.  THE BIG SYSTEM OUT TO THE WEST LOOKS LIKE IT WILL NOT BE 
CLOSE ENOUGH TO SPREAD ANYTHING THIS WAY BY TUESDAY...SPRINKLES 
MENTIONED MAINLY JUST FROM SUPER-SATURATED AIR MASS WITH ANY LITTLE

WILL TRACK FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES.

MOISTURE TO THE AREA AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT THAT WILL SWING THOUGH

WIND FIELDS THERE IS A THREAT OF SEVERE STORMS.  LIMITING FACTOR MAY 
BE INSTABILITY WHICH LOOKS FAIRLY WEAK AT THIS TIME...BUT STILL 
ENOUGH FOR SEVERE STORMS TO BE A CONCERN.  ALSO COULD BE SOME FAIRLY 
STRONG WINDS LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...ESPECIALLY OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  FOR NOW WILL KEEP MENTION OF THE WINDS AND 
SEVERE THREAT IN THE HWO. LOOKS LIKE SOME SNOW SHOWERS MAY AFFECT 
ESPECIALLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY 
THURSDAY...BUT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A GOOD UPSLOPE EVENT SO WILL NOT 
PLAY UP SNOW POTENTIAL...KEEPING POPS FAIRLY LOW FOR NOW.  A WEAK 
AND FAST MOVING SYSTEM MAY BRING SOME SNOW SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO EARLY FRIDAY...ESPECIALLY NORTH...SO WILL KEEP SOME SLIGHT 
CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS.  ANOTHER WEAK SYSTEM MOVING THROUGH THE 
FAST FLOW MAY BRING SHOWERS/SNOW SHOWERS TO THE AREA SAT INTO SAT

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE AND 850 MB RIDGE HAVE 
SHIFTED TO ALONG THE EAST COAST THIS MORNING. THE WARM SOUTHERLY 
FLOW INTO THE TN VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS HAS THANKFULLY PURGED 
THE ARCTIC AIR MASS OUT OF THE REGION. APPEARS THAT A WARM FRONT HAS 
MOVED NE INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...LEAVING VERY MILD TEMPERATURES 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MOSTLY IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S.  

AN AREA OF LIGHT RAIN FELL ACROSS THE NRN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA 
LATE SUNDAY EVENING...WITH SPOTTY AREAS OF LIGHT RAIN OVERNIGHT. THE 
WARM AND MOIST S-SW FLOW CONTINUES TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT ANY 
ORGANIZED OR SIGNIFICANT LIFT SEEMS TO BE LACKING. THUS...I OPTED TO 
KEEP POPS ON THE LOW SIDE WITH BETTER CHANCES FROM THE NRN PLATEAU 
COUNTIES INTO SW VA FOR THESE PERIODS. CAN'T RULE OUT LIGHT RAIN FOR 
REMAINING AREAS...BUT I WOULD THINK A TRACE EVENT AT BEST. 

CLOUD COVER WILL BE PROMINENT AND COULD INHIBIT WARMING OUT OF THE 
50S...SO I TRENDED CLOSE TO A MOS BLEND FOR HIGHS TODAY. LOWS 
TONIGHT SHOULD BE IN THE 40S IF NOT MILDER...SO NO LOWER THAN UPPER 
30S FOR ANY AREAS. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...CHANGEABLE PATTERN OVER THE
FIRST FEW DAYS AS DEEP TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN STATES CAUSES
RIDGING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. ABUNDANT MOISTURE OVER MOST OF THE
REGION BUT WEAK LIFT WILL KEEP THE AREA MOSTLY CLOUDY EXCEPT ACROSS
THE NE AND INCREASING SOUTH WINDS WILL BRING HIGHS TO ALMOST 20
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL...IN THE MID 60S TO NEAR 70. TUESDAY NIGHT AND
WEDNESDAY STRONG SOUTHWEST WINDS ALOFT DEVELOP WITH HIGHEST WINDS
AT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS. A WIND
ADVISORY WILL LIKELY BE NEEDED FOR TUESDAY EVENING INTO WEDNESDAY.
LOWS TUESDAY NIGHT WILL STAY VERY MILD DUE TO CLOUDS AND WINDS. A
SQUALL LINE MAY FORM TO THE WEST AHEAD OF THE FRONT WITH ADDITIONAL 
SHOWER ACTIVITY DEVELOPING ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA LATE IN
THE NIGHT. THE STRONG FLOW ALOFT MAY BRING DAMAGING WINDS TO THE
SURFACE WITH THE SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS EARLY WEDNESDAY
THROUGH MID AFTERNOON. HIGHS WEDNESDAY TRICKY AS GFS MODEL BRINGS
FRONT THROUGH THE REGION IN THE MORNING WHILE NAM IS SEVERAL HOURS
SLOWER. COMPROMISED WITH HIGHS AND WENT A FEW DEGREES BELOW
GUIDANCE BUT ONLY A FEW DEGREES ABOVE WEDNESDAY MORNING LOWS. HEAVY
RAIN A POSSIBILITY WITH SHOWERS AND POSSIBLE THUNDERSTORMS
WEDNESDAY BUT HE SPEED OF THE SYSTEM WILL LIKELY KEEP FLOODING TO A
MINIMUM. MUCH COLDER AIR MASS MOVES IN BEHIND FRONT WITH RAIN
SHOWERS CHANGING TO SNOW SHOWERS OVERNIGHT AND INTO THURSDAY.
LITTLE TO NO ACCUMULATION LIKELY WITH THIS FIRST SYSTEM. ANOTHER
FAST MOVING SYSTEM FRIDAY AND LATE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY WILL BRING
A COUPLE MORE SHOTS OF SNOW. AS TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLDER IN THE
NW FLOW PATTERN FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND THE NE
THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA COULD SEE A FEW INCHES OF MEASURABLE SNOW.

THROUGH THE PERIOD. MID LEVEL SPEED MAX MOVES NE THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN TN VALLEY THIS EVENING. CLOUDS HAVE ALREADY INCREASED

NORTHERN AREAS THIS EVENING AND TONIGHT. MIN TEMPERATURES ACROSS NE 
AREAS OVERNIGHT A BIT TRICKY BUT MOST AREAS SHOULD STAY ABOVE

SOUTHERN AREAS. THIS FEATURE WILL ALSO TRANSPORT INCREASING LOW

BUILD THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD AND LOW LEVEL SWRLY FLOW 
INCREASES WITH TIME. TEMPERATURES WILL STEADILY CLIMB TO WELL ABOVE 
NORMAL BY TUESDAY.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...STILL A BUSY PATTERN 
AHEAD...WITH COLD FRONT DUE IN MID WEEK...THEN UPPER NORTHWEST FLOW 
SENDING CLIPPERS OVER THE AREA.  ONE NOTE TO THIS NORTHWEST FLOW IS 
THAT IT IS A RELATIVELY FLAT NW FLOW...MEANING THAT THE MOIST FETCH 
FROM THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WILL LIKELY STAY NORTH OF US...SO WE 
WILL BE DEPENDING MORE ON ORGANIZED SYNOPTIC LIFT.  WITH THIS IN 
MIND...I HAVE TRIMMED THE UPSLOPE FLOW PRECIP CHANCES SOMEWHAT IN 
SOME OF THESE LATER PERIODS...MAINLY KEEPING POPS IN THE NORTHERN 
MOUNTAINS.

WILL NEED TO WATCH CLIPPER SYSTEM DUE IN THURSDAY NIGHT OR 
FRIDAY...AIRMASS IS COLD AND DENTRITIC GROWTH REGIONS WILL BE 
UNUSUALLY LOW...MAKING IT MUCH MORE EFFICIENT FOR SNOW GROWTH...EVEN 
IF THE MOISTURE IS NOT OVERLY DEEP.  TRACK IN DIFFERENT MODELS WITH 
THIS SYSTEM IS WAFFLING NORTH-SOUTH...WITH NORTHERN AREAS IN CWA 
HAVING BETTER CHANCES.

TIMING FOR STORMS STILL SEEMS TO BE LACKING SOMEWHAT FOR GOOD 
ORGANIZATION SINCE IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST CHANCE FOR THE PASSAGE OF 
THE INSTABILITY AXIS IS DURING THE COOLER HOURS LATE TUESDAY NIGHT

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE RIDGE MOVING EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS TODAY WILL ALLOW A WARMING SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW TO 
DEVELOP. CLOUDS INCREASE TODAY AND THERE APPEARS TO BE A CHANCE OF 
LIGHT RAIN BY MAINLY LATE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT...AS AN ASSOCIATED 
WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. QPF LOOKS 
VERY LIGHT WITH BEST CHANCES MOSTLY ACROSS NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES AND 
SW VA. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR EXTREME SRN AREAS TONIGHT...BUT 
COULD JUST BE CLOUDS FOR THOSE SRN AREAS.

GIVEN THE SOUTHERLY FLOW...850 MB TEMPS AND CLOUDS...I OPTED TO KEEP 
OUR MINS TONIGHT AT AND ABOVE 32 DEGREES...SO ONLY LIGHT RAIN FOR 
PCPN TYPE. FOR MAX TEMPS TODAY I FAVORED A BLEND OF MOS.

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WARM ADVECTION LIGHT RAIN 
STILL LOOKS TO BE POSSIBLE MONDAY MORNING AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVES 
EAST ACROSS THE TN AND OH VALLEYS EARLY MONDAY. SKIES REMAIN MOSTLY 
CLOUDY AND SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW BRINGS MORE WARMING TEMPERATURES. 
MONDAY NIGHT LOOKS MOSTLY DRY AS RIDGING BUILDS UP FROM THE SOUTH 
KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE ALONG THE NORTHERN BORDER AS NAM SHOWS SOME 
WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING NE FROM THE MS AND LOWER OH VALLEYS 
INTO EASTERN KY AND EXTREME NORTHERN TN. TUESDAY RIDGE CONTINUES TO 
BUILD NORTH WITH DEEPENING TROUGH TO THE WEST. TEMPERATURES MUCH 
ABOVE NORMAL WITH VERY SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS NORTHERN PLATEAU. MAJOR 
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND WEDNESDAY. STRONG SOUTHWEST WIND FIELD MAY WARRANT A WIND 
ADVISORY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE. THUNDERSTORMS MORE PROBABLE WEDNESDAY MORNING JUST AHEAD 
OF COLD FRONT. A SQUALL LINE TO THE WEST OF THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT 
MAY INTENSIFY AS WINDS ALOFT WILL STRENGTHEN ALONG THE FRONT EVEN 
THOUGH INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED. WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT 
MUCH COLDER WITH STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION. RAIN SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS CHANGE OVER TO SNOW SHOWERS AS NW FLOW PATTERN SETS 
UP. A FEW INCHES POSSIBLE IN THE MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF 
THE NE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. COLDER PATTERN CONTINUES 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED WITH A COUPLE FAST MOVING SYSTEMS FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY BRINGING MORE SNOW CHANCES. FRIDAYS SYSTEM LOOKS MORE 
SIGNIFICANT WITH COLDER TEMPERATURES. A COUPLE INCHES POSSIBLE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE RIDGE MOVING EAST OF
THE APPALACHIANS TODAY WILL ALLOW A WARMING SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL
FLOW TO DEVELOP. CLOUDS INCREASE TODAY AND THERE APPEARS TO BE A
CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN BY MAINLY LATE EVENING AND OVERNIGHT...AS AN
ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY.
QPF LOOKS VERY LIGHT WITH BEST CHANCES MOSTLY ACROSS NRN PLATEAU
COUNTIES AND SW VA. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR EXTREME SRN AREAS
TONIGHT...BUT COULD JUST BE CLOUDS FOR THOSE SRN AREAS.

GIVEN THE SOUTHERLY FLOW...850 MB TEMPS AND CLOUDS...I OPTED TO KEEP 
OUR MINS TONIGHT AT AND ABOVE 32 DEGREES...SO ONLY LIGHT RAIN FOR 
PCPN TYPE. FOR MAX TEMPS TODAY I FAVORED A BLEND OF MOS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WARM ADVECTION LIGHT RAIN
STILL LOOKS TO BE POSSIBLE MONDAY MORNING AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY
MOVES EAST ACROSS THE TN AND OH VALLEYS EARLY MONDAY. SKIES REMAIN
MOSTLY CLOUDY AND SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW BRINGS MORE WARMING
TEMPERATURES. MONDAY NIGHT LOOKS MOSTLY DRY AS RIDGING BUILDS UP
FROM THE SOUTH KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE ALONG THE NORTHERN BORDER AS
NAM SHOWS SOME WEAK SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING NE FROM THE MS AND
LOWER OH VALLEYS INTO EASTERN KY AND EXTREME NORTHERN TN. TUESDAY
RIDGE CONTINUES TO BUILD NORTH WITH DEEPENING TROUGH TO THE WEST.
TEMPERATURES MUCH ABOVE NORMAL WITH VERY SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS
NORTHERN PLATEAU. MAJOR TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT BEGINS TO
SHIFT EAST TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. STRONG SOUTHWEST WIND FIELD
MAY WARRANT A WIND ADVISORY TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AND
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. THUNDERSTORMS MORE PROBABLE
WEDNESDAY MORNING JUST AHEAD OF COLD FRONT. A SQUALL LINE TO THE
WEST OF THE AREA TUESDAY NIGHT MAY INTENSIFY AS WINDS ALOFT WILL
STRENGTHEN ALONG THE FRONT EVEN THOUGH INSTABILITY WILL BE LIMITED.
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND NIGHT MUCH COLDER WITH STRONG COLD AIR
ADVECTION. RAIN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CHANGE OVER TO SNOW
SHOWERS AS NW FLOW PATTERN SETS UP. A FEW INCHES POSSIBLE IN THE
MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE NE WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO
THURSDAY. COLDER PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH THE EXTENDED WITH A
COUPLE FAST MOVING SYSTEMS FRIDAY AND SATURDAY BRINGING MORE SNOW
CHANCES. FRIDAYS SYSTEM LOOKS MORE SIGNIFICANT WITH COLDER
TEMPERATURES. A COUPLE INCHES POSSIBLE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST
AREA.

344 PM EST SAT JAN 26 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER OHIO WILL SLIDE SE THROUGH THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TO THE 
VA/NC COAST BY SUNDAY. STUBBORN LOW LEVEL TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED 
CLOUD COVER HAS LINGERED OVER SW VA AND NE TN. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD 
ERODE AS LOWER DEW POINTS ASSOCIATED WITH NORTHERN RIDGE SHOULD JUST 
CLIP NE AREAS OVERNIGHT ...OTHERWISE AIRMASS ACROSS MRX CWA CHANGES 
LITTLE OVERNIGHT. ..CONTINUE TO EXPECT THESE CLOUDS TO ERODE 
TONIGHT. UPPER HEIGHTS RISE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH SUNDAY. WEAK 
WARMING AND MOISTURE TRANSPORT IN THE 700 MB LAYER WILL BRING IN 
SOME MID CLOUDS FROM THE SOUTHWEST. TEMPERATURES SHOULD CLIMB TO 
ABOVE NORMAL DESPITE LATE CLOUD COVER. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...VERY VERY BUSY PATTERN 
WITH RIDGE BUILDING INTO THE AREA EARLY IN THE PERIOD ALONG WITH 
ASSOCIATED WARM ADVECTION PRECIPITATION...FOLLOWED BY LARGE TROUGH 
THAT SWINGS INTO THE AREA FOR THE MID AND LATTER PARTS OF THIS 
PERIOD...THAT SENDS A SERIES OF CLIPPER SYSTEMS OUR WAY.

WITH WARM ADVECTION AT ALL LEVELS AND BLANKETING CLOUDS MOVING INTO 
THE AREA SUNDAY NIGHT...FEEL THAT GUIDANCE LOW TEMPS ARE TOO LOW 
ACROSS THE AREA...HAVE BUMPED UP BY 1-2 CATEGORIES.  THIS RESULTS IN 
PRECIP THAT MOVES IN TO BE ALL LIQUID EVEN IN THE MOUNTAINS.

TIMING OF COLD FRONT AND STORMS STILL A LITTLE IN QUESTION...BUT 
PRETTY MUCH BRACKETED BY TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. CHANCES OF 
SEVERE STORMS NOT THAT GREAT FOR NOW...UNLESS TIMING OF FRONT ENDS 
UP BEING DURING MAX HEATING.

COLD AIR AND CLOUDS HANGING IN ON THURSDAY...WILL GO WELL BELOW 
GUIDANCE ON MAX TEMP AND THINK THAT SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE THE RULE ON 
THURSDAY FOR PRECIP TYPE IN THE NERN HALF OF AREA.

STILL UNSETTLED TOWARD THE END OF THE PERIOD AS SHORTWAVES STILL 
LOOK TO BE RIDING ACROSS THE AREA.

UPWARD. LOWERED CLOUD COVER SLIGHTLY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING 
IN FROM THE NW. NEAR NEUTRAL TEMPERATURE ADVECTION. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LOW CLOUDS LINGER ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA...BUT RADARS ARE GENERALLY ECHO FREE. CLOUD HEIGHTS 
ARE LIFTING AND VISBYS IMPROVING...SO FOG IS NOT MUCH OF AN ISSUE AT 
THIS TIME. CLOUDS HAVE KEPT TEMPS FROM DROPPING BELOW 32 DEGREES 
OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...CERTAINLY BENEFICIAL IN LOCATIONS 
THAT RECEIVED THE ICY PRECIPITATION FRIDAY. 

SUNSHINE TO RETURN TODAY...BUT I AM SKEPTICAL THAT TEMPS CAN WARM TO 
THE GFS MOS HIGHS. 850 MB TEMPS ARE MORE SUPPORTIVE OF THE COOLER 
NAM MOS HIGHS...ESPECIALLY OVER SW VA AND NE TN. LOW LEVELS STAY DRY 
TONIGHT WITH AN INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUDS AHEAD OF THE WEAK SYSTEM ON 
SUNDAY. GFS MINS LOOKED REASONABLE FOR TONIGHT.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE AREA BEGINS TO 
SHIFT TO THE EAST COAST SUNDAY AS LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE 
CENTRAL STATES. SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL WARM TEMPERATURES ABOUT 5 DEGREES
SOUTH TO 10 DEGREES NORTH. CLOUDS INCREASE AS WARM FRONT MOVES NORTH 
ACROSS THE TN VALLEY LATE SUNDAY INTO THE OH VALLEY MONDAY. AS 
ATMOSPHERE MOISTENS RAIN POSSIBLE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY BUT ONLY 
LIGHT AMOUNTS EXPECTED. SOUTHWEST UPPER FLOW INCREASES TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY WITH CONTINUED WARMING AND A CHANCE FOR THUNDERSTORMS BY 
WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT. DEEP TROUGH BEHIND THE FRONT BRINGS 
MUCH COLDER AIR MASS INTO THE REGION WITH THE SHOWERS CHANGING TO 
SNOW SHOWERS LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. SKIES BEGIN CLEARING 
LATE THURSDAY AND THEN WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP SKIES SUNNY

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
412 AM EST FRI JAN 25 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CHALLENGING FORECAST THIS MORNING 
AS PRECIPITATION (PCPN) IS JUST DEVELOPING TO OUR WEST OVER MIDDLE 
TN. COLD AIR MASS WEDGED IN PLACE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA IS VERY 
DRY WITH ARCTIC DEW POINTS. THUS...INITIAL PCPN WILL STRUGGLE TO 
REACH THE SURFACE...AND THE WARMER AIR ALOFT WILL CREATE A WINTRY 
MIX TODAY. NAM AND SREF MODEL SOUNDINGS HAVE TRENDED WARMER AND NOT 
AS SUPPORTIVE FOR WARNING AMOUNTS OF ICING. GFS MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE 
SLIGHTLY COLDER AND IN LINE WITH 1/10 TO 1/4 INCH ICING...WHICH 
SEEMS REASONABLE GIVEN THE COLD AIR MASS IN PLACE. FREEZING RAIN WILL 
BE THE MOST COMMON PCPN TYPE THIS MORNING...ALTHOUGH SOUNDINGS FOR SW 
VA AND EXTREME NE TN INDICATE POTENTIAL FOR LIGHT SNOW AS WELL. 

PCPN TYPE BY THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD TRANSITION TO A COLD RAIN ON THE 
PLATEAU...SE TN AND UP THE CENTRAL VALLEY OF EAST TN. SHELTERED OR 
DEEPER VALLEYS COULD SEE LIGHT FREEZING RAIN OR SLEET LINGER...SUCH 
AS NOTED FOR OUR SW NC COUNTIES. INTERESTING EVENT AS ELEVATIONS 
PROBABLY ABOVE 2500 FEET IN THE SMOKIES GET MOSTLY RAIN. UNDERCUT 
THE WARMER GFS MOS MAX TEMPS FOR TODAY...IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS MAX 
TEMP GRID. OTHER THAN A FEW TWEAKS ON QPF/SNOW/ICE AMOUNT GRIDS...
CLOSE FOLLOWED PREVIOUS FORECAST. FREEZING RAIN AND WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORIES LOOK ON TRACK...FOR TIMING AND GENERALLY ON AMOUNTS. 

FOR TONIGHT...PCPN EVENT WRAPS UP IN THE EVENING WITH NO CHANGES 
MADE FOR NOW. MIN TEMPS WERE NUDGED UP A BIT IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS 
NUMBERS AND TO MESH WITH NWS NEIGHBORS. MAY NEED TO CONSIDER ADDING 
SOME PATCHY FOG OR DRIZZLE (FREEZING?) LATE TONIGHT...BUT SOUNDINGS 
SEEMED TO DRY OUT THE BOUNDARY LAYER.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING SE 
FROM THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND WESTERN GREAT LAKES WILL BRING A SUNNY 
AND WARMER DAY TO THE REGION SATURDAY. THINK NE TN AND SW VA WILL 
HAVE SOME SNOW AND ICE COVER AND ALL AREAS WILL STILL HAVE COLD AIR 
ADVECTION CONTINUING DURING THE DAY SATURDAY. AS A RESULT UNDERCUT 
HIGHS A FEW DEGREES WITH MID 30S TO NEAR 40 NE TN AND SW VA TO THE 
MID TO UPPER 40S ELSEWHERE. SATURDAY NIGHT MOSTLY CLEAR WITH SURFACE 
HIGH SETTLING OVER UPPER OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS. LOWS AGAIN 
BELOW FREEZING SATURDAY NIGHT WITH LIGHT WINDS. SUNDAY RIDGING 
BUILDS OVER THE EASTERN STATES AHEAD OF DIGGING TROUGH OVER THE 
WESTERN STATES. MOISTURE BEGINS TO INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
WITH CLOUDS INCREASING. SUNDAY NIGHT A WARM FRONT MOVES NORTH ACROSS 
THE REGION. SOME LIGHT RAIN POSSIBLE SUNDAY NIGHT WITH THE FRONT AND 
MUCH WARMER LOW TEMPERATURES. SOME LIGHT FREEZING RAIN IS POSSIBLE 
OVER THE NE TN VALLEYS BEFORE TEMPERATURES WARM MONDAY MORNING. 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY A SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT WILL BRING ADDITIONAL 
RAIN CHANCES TO THE FORECAST AREA AND MUCH WARMER TEMPERATURES AS 
GULF MOISTURE IS PUMPED UP INTO THE REGION WITH A SOUTHERLY FLOW. 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY THE AIR MASS BECOMES UNSTABLE ENOUGH FOR 
SOME THUNDERSTORMS. HIGHS TUESDAY SHOULD REACH THE 60S. AFTER COLD 
FRONTAL PASSAGE WEDNESDAY IT WILL BE MUCH COOLER WITH ANOTHER SHOT 
OF SNOW WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING CLEARING LATER 
THURSDAY.

935 PM EST THU JAN 24 2013

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE WITH 
COLD ARCTIC AIR CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION...WITH AN AREA 
OF LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS AREA OF 
LOW PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE RIVER VALLEY 
DURING THE LATE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON HOURS ON FRIDAY...WITH A 
STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN AHEAD OF IT BRINGING A DEEP (900 
TO 700 MB) ABOVE-FREEZING LAYER OVER A SUB-FREEZING LAYER REMAINING 
ENTRENCHED AT THE SURFACE. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THE VERY 
DRY LOW-LEVEL AIR MASS SHOULD CREATE ENOUGH EVAPORATIVE COOLING AT 
THE ONSET OF PRECIPITATION (TOWARDS SUNRISE) TO CREATE FREEZING RAIN 
AND SLEET THROUGH THE MORNING HOURS. A SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW NEAR THE 
SURFACE MAY HELP TO PUSH TEMPS ABOVE FREEZING DURING THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS ACROSS MOST OF EAST TN AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST NC. WITH THIS IN 
MIND...IT APPEARS THAT ANY ICE ACCUMULATIONS (AND POSSIBLY SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN) WILL REMAIN IN THE 
ADVISORY CATEGORY...WHICH WILL BE ENOUGH TO CAUSE TRAVEL PROBLEMS IN 
MOST AREAS ON FRIDAY.

OVERALL...PREVIOUS FORECAST APPEARED TO BE ON TRACK FOR TONIGHT AND 
FRIDAY...BUT ALREADY UPDATED EARLIER THIS EVENING TO TWEAK THE 
WORDING A LITTLE TO REFLECT THE LATEST THOUGHTS ABOVE.

.AVIATION...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH CONTINUES STEADILY EAST ACROSS THE
PLAINS STATES EARLY THIS EVENING ON ITS WAY INTO THE EASTERN U.S.
LATE TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY. AVIATION WEATHER WILL DETERIORATE BUT IT
WILL TAKE QUITE A WHILE TO DEVELOP AN MVFR CEILING AS WARM...MOIST
AIR OVERRIDES A SUBFREEZING SURFACE AIRMASS. BEST BET IS FOR A
MIXTURE OF FREEZING RAIN AND SLEET BEGINNING AT CHA AROUND 12Z IN
MVFR CONDITIONS. AS THE SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW STRENGTHENS DURING
THE MORNING WOULD EXPECT PRECIP TO SWITCH TO RAIN AT CHA WITH
CONDITIONS DROPPING INTO THE IFR CATEGORY. MVFR FLIGHT CONDITIONS
MAY NOT DEVELOP AT TYS UNTIL 13Z WHERE THE MAIN PRECIP TYPE MAY BE
SLEET (AND SOME SNOW) TO START BUT WOULD TRANSITION TO FREEZING
RAIN BY LATE MORNING BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN AROUND EARLY
AFTERNOON. IFR FLIGHT LOOKS PROBABLE BY LATE MORNING AS A CEILING
LOOKS TO FORM JUST UNDER 3000 FT. TRI MAY STAY VFR ALL THE WAY
UNTIL 14Z AS LIGHT SNOW AND SLEET FALL INTO THE COLDER LOW LEVEL
AIRMASS GENERATING A CEILING RIGHT AROUND 3000 FT. DETERIORATION TO
IFR FLIGHT WOULD BECOME MORE LIKELY BY NOON HERE AS PREDOMINANT PRECIP
TYPE CHANGES TO SLEET WITH INCREASING DEPTH OF WARM AIR ALOFT AHEAD
OF THE 85H TROUGH. BY THE END OF THE EVENT AROUND 20Z AND LATER IFR
CONDITIONS SHOULD PREVAIL DUE TO A CEILING UNDER 3000 FT BUT PRECIP
SHOULD BECOME MUCH LIGHTER IN INTENSITY AND MAY HAVE CHANGED TO
LIQUID WITH JUST ENOUGH WARMING TO RAISE SURFACE TEMPERATURES ABOVE
FREEZING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE 
SE FROM THE SE OHIO RIVER VALLEY TO EAST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. AN UPPER SPEED MAX WILL MOVE SE INTO THE OH 
RIVER VALLEY FRIDAY. DRY COLD AIRMASS WILL BE IN PLACE TONIGHT 
ACROSS THE AREA. STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION AND MOISTURE TRANSPORT 
WILL OCCUR IN THE 850-700 MB LAYER. THIS MOIST LAYER WILL MOVE EAST 
INTO THE AREA SHORTLY BEFORE DAY BREAK. GOOD ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL 
AID IN THE PRECIPITATION PROCESS. THE FREEZING LEVEL WILL INITIALLY 
BE NEAR 3500 FEET WITH WARMER TEMPS ALOFT. THE FREEZING LEVEL 
SHRINKS TO NEAR 2000 FEET BY MID DAY FRIDAY. THE WARM LAYER IS 
SUFFICIENTLY DEEP TO MELT SNOW AND FAVOR RAIN OVER SLEET. THE RAIN 
WILL FALL THROUGH THE COLD LAYER AND FREEZE ON CONTACT WITH ALL 
SURFACE. EXPECTED ICE ACCUMULATION IS LESS THAN 1:1 WITH QPF 
EXPECTED RAINFALL RATES TO BE CLOSE TO MODERATE AT TIMES WHICH WOULD 
HINDER ACCRETION.  THE WARM LAYER EXTENDS TO NE TN DURING THE DAY. 
SOME SLEET CAN BE EXPECTED NEAR THE BOUNDARY WITH MOSTLY SNOW 
EXPECTED NE OF THE ELEVATED FREEZING BOUNDARY. SLIGHTLY ABOVE 
FREEZING SURFACE TEMPERATURES WILL MOVE NE UP THE E TN VALLEY BY 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON HELPING TO LIMIT ADDITIONAL ICE ACCUMULATIONS. 
WENT SLIGHTLY BELOW AGREEABLE MOS GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THE MAIN STORM SYSTEM 
WILL BE WINDING DOWN FRIDAY NIGHT...HOWEVER THERE WILL BE LINGERING 
WINTRY PRECIPITATION CONTINUING INTO THE EVENING HOURS. ONLY LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS OF SNOW AND/OR ICE ARE EXPECTED AND THIS SHOULD HAVE 
MINIMAL IMPACTS ESPECIALLY COMPARED WITH WHAT COULD OCCUR EARLIER ON 
FRIDAY. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION SATURDAY 
AND SUNDAY WITH DAYTIME TEMPERATURES IN THE 30S NORTH AND 40S SOUTH.

FOR MONDAY A SHORTWAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS E TX AND INTO E TN MONDAY 
BRINGING SLIGHT CHANCES OF PRECIPITATION TO THE AREA. A LARGER TROUGH 
ON MONDAY WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES. THIS SYSTEM WILL 
BE STRONG ENOUGH TO PULL IN PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE ALONG THE 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. THE FRONT WILL BEGIN TO IMPACT E TN...SW VA 
AND SW NC TUESDAY NIGHT. SOME SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS COULD 
ACCOMPANY THE RAIN TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL 
CERTAINLY BE NOTICEABLY WARMER WITH FORECAST HIGHS NEAR 60 DEGREES. 

COLD AIR BEHIND THE FRONT WILL DROP OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES ON 
WEDNESDAY INTO THE UPPER 20S AND 30S FOR MUCH OF THE REGION. LOW 
LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW WILL BE FAVORABLE FOR SOME WINTRY 
PRECIPITATION ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. AT THIS THE FORECAST 
CONFIDENCE FOR THIS TO OCCUR IS LOW AND THERE IS NO RELIABLE 
INDICATION OF HOW MUCH...IF ANY ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE.
DAYTIME TEMPS GET BACK TO NEAR SEASONAL ON THURSDAY.

TODAY.  OTHERWISE...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BRIEFLY BUILD IN FOR 
DRY CONDITIONS THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING.  AN APPROACHING LOW

415 PM EST WED JAN 23 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER SPEED MAX WILL MOVE 
SOUTHEAST THROUGH SW VA TONIGHT. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE QUICKLY 
SUPPRESSES SOUTH OF THE AREA. A SHOT OF WEAK WARM AIR ADVECTION IS 
UNDERWAY IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. DEW POINTS COMING 
UP BUT WILL DROP SHARPLY AGAIN BEHIND THE FRONT. LIGHT SNOW EXPECTED 
NEAR UPPER JET WHERE AVAILABLE MID LEVEL MOISTURE IS IN THE SNOW 
GROWTH REGION. THIS SNOW WILL FALL THROUGH A VERY DRY 850-700 LAYER 
LIMITING AMOUNTS. OTHERWISE...MOISTURE WILL TRANSPORT IN THE 
1000-850 MB LAYER IN ADVANCE OF THE COLD FRONT.
LIGHT FREEZING DRIZZLE AND FREEZING RAIN EXPECTED WITH VERY WEAK 
LIFT. ANY ACCUMULATION WILL BE LIGHT. COLD FRONT MOVES SE OF THE 
AREA EARLY THU WITH HIGH PRESSURE AND A DRY AIRMASS IN ITS WAKE. 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE. LEANED ON THE COOL SIDE OF 
GOOD MODEL AGREEMENT. 

.MID TERM.../THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY/...THE MAIN FOCUS OF 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD IS THE WINTER STORM EXPECTED TO IMPACT THE AREA 
LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...BEFORE EXITING THE REGION FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THE FORECAST REMAINS COMPLICATED TO SAY THE LEAST...WITH THE 
BIGGEST QUESTION BEING PRECIPITATION TYPE AND THE DURATION FOR A 
GIVEN LOCATION. HOWEVER...MODELS HAVE COME INTO GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
TIMING...AND THE POTENTIAL FOR BTWN 0.25 TO 0.75 INCHES OF LIQUID 
EQUIVALENT PRECIPITATION...WITH THE HIGHER VALUES OF 0.50 TO 0.75 
INCHES GENERALLY FAVORING AREAS ALONG AND SOUTH OF THE INTERSTATE 40 
CORRIDOR. THE PEAK TIME FOR PRECIPITATION APPEARS TO BE BETWEEN 
12-21Z ON FRIDAY...BEFORE THINGS BEGIN TO TAPER OFF SLOWLY FROM WEST 
TO EAST. HAVE RAISED POPS TO LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL DURING THIS TIME 
PERIOD AS A RESULT. 

ATTM...MODEL SOUNDINGS AT KCHA AND KTYS HAVE CONTINUED THEIR TREND 
OF PERSISTENT SUBFREEZING SURFACE TEMPERATURES AND A VERY PRONOUNCED 
WARM NOSE /WITH 5000 FT TEMPS WARMING TO 3-6 DEGREES CELCIUS/. THIS 
IS INDICATING THE POTENTIAL FOR A LONG DURATION FREEZING RAIN EVENT 
FOR THE SOUTHERN TENNESSEE VALLEY ZONES AND A SLEET/FREEZING RAIN 
EVENT FOR THE CENTRAL/NORTHERN TENNESSEE VALLEY ZONES. THIS WOULD 
RESULT IN A SIGNIFICANT ICE STORM FOR MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA...AS 
WIDESPREAD 0.10-0.15 INCH AMOUNTS EXPECTED AND THE POTENTIAL FOR 
SEVERAL POCKETS APPROACHING A QUARTER OF INCH ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
TENNESSEE VALLEY. ACROSS FOR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA...MODELS SHOW THAT THE ENTIRE VERTICAL PROFILE REMAINS AT 
OR BELOW FREEZING FOR THE ENTIRE EVENT...SUGGESTING AN ALL-SNOW TO A 
SNOW-SLEET MIXTURE FOR THESE AREAS...WITH TOTAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
BEING BETWEEN 1-4 INCHES...GENERALLY TO THE NORTH AND EAST OF 
MORRISTOWN. 

THE ONE UNCERTAINTY AS ALWAYS WILL BE HOW MUCH WARMING WILL TAKE 
PLACE DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. GIVEN THE EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND 
PRECIPITATION...AM NOT EXPECTING TEMPERATURES TO WARM AS MUCH AS MOS 
VALUES ARE SHOWING...PARTICULARLY IF A LIGHT NORTHEAST FLOW PERSISTS 
DOWN THE VALLEY /SOMETHING THAT MODELS USUALLY STRUGGLE WITH 
IDENTIFYING/. THIS WOULD RESULT IN THE COLDER AIR BEING MUCH SLOWER 
TO ERODE FROM THE VALLEYS EVEN IF WINDS ALOFT VEER TO THE SOUTHWEST. 
THIS THINKING IS SUPPORTED BY THE SOUNDING PROFILES...ESPECIALLY THE 
NAM WHICH SUGGESTS WINTERY PRECIPITATION PERSISTING THROUGH THE 
ENTIRE EVENT IN NEARLY ALL AREAS. GIVEN THIS...WILL ISSUE A WINTER 
STORM WATCH FROM 06Z FRIDAY THROUGH 00Z SATURDAY.  

SHOULD THIS SCENARIO PLAY OUT AS THE FORECAST SUGGESTS...THIS RARE 
AND SIGNIFICANT ICE STORM WOULD RESULT IN EXTREMELY HAZARDOUS 
TRAVEL CONDITIONS AND THE POSSIBILITY FOR WIDESPREAD POWER OUTAGES. 
IT CANNOT BE UNDERSCORED ENOUGH THAT RESIDENTS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION SHOULD FOLLOW THE PROGRESS OF THIS STORM SYSTEM 
CLOSELY AND THE POTENTIAL FOR HAZARDOUS WINTER WEATHER CONDITIONS ON 
FRIDAY!       

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A RIDGE POSITIONED OFF THE 
COAST OF GA WILL PROVIDE A WARMING TREND FOR SUNDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY...WITH HIGHS TUESDAY REACHING WELL INTO THE 60S ACROSS MUCH 
OF THE TN VALLEY. THE EASTWARD DRIFT OF THE RIDGE AND THE APPROACH 
OF A POSITIVELY TILTED TROUGH FROM THE WEST WILL BEGIN TO ADVECT 
GULF MOISTURE INTO THE AREA LATE MONDAY. GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SHOW 
GOOD CLUSTERING OF PRECIP OVER THE APPALACHIANS ON TUESDAY 
NIGHT...AND WILL RAISE POPS TO A HIGH CHANCE FOR THIS PERIOD. THE 
TROUGH SHOWS SLOW EASTWARD PROGRESS...AND THE ECMWF IS SLOWER WITH 
THE PRECIP THAN THE GFS...SO WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING INTO 
WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL 
TODAY FOR DRY CONDITIONS AND SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES.  A WEAK 
IMPULSE SLIDES INTO THE REGION OVERNIGHT.  MOISTURE IS LIMITED WITH 
THIS SYSTEM BUT WITH COLD AIR IN PLACE COULD SEE PATCHY FREEZING 
RAIN OR DRIZZLE...MAINLY OVER THE NORTH HALF OF THE CWA.  A FEW 
FLURRIES MAY MIX IN AS WELL BY SUNRISE.  PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS SHOULD 
BE LIGHT WITH A COUPLE OF HUNDREDTH POSSIBLE.

.LONG TERM...VERY DIFFICULT FORECAST FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY.
MODELS HAVE BEEN INCONSISTENT...AND MODEL AGREEMENT LACKING AS WELL
SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW. WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM FORECAST TO MOVE
FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION...WITH WARM ADVECTION
DEVELOPING OVER OUR AREA THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. LIGHT PRECIP IS
FORECAST TO BREAK OUT WITH THE ISENTROPIC LIFT...BUT HOW MUCH
MOISTURE WILL BE AVAILABLE IS STILL UNCERTAIN. MODEL SOUNDINGS
INDICATE A WINTRY MIX. WITH WARMER AIR MOVING OVER THE COLDER
AIR AT THE SURFACE...FREEZING RAIN MAY BE A THREAT OVER MUCH OF THE
AREA. ANY SNOW SHOULD BE MAINLY LIMITED TO NORTHERN AREAS. WILL
KEEP AMOUNTS FAIRLY LIGHT AT THIS POINT...AND WILL CONTINUE MENTION
IN HWO. LOOKS DRY FOR THE WEEKEND...THEN INCREASING MOISTURE AND
WARMER AIR BRING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT RAIN OR LIGHT SNOW IN THE FORECAST. A STRONG 
WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN THEN DEVELOPS THURSDAY NIGHT OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF THE DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATING AN ABOVE-FREEZING 
850 TO 750 MB LAYER PRODUCING THE POSSIBILITY OF A LIGHT WINTRY MIX 
OF LIGHT RAIN...LIGHT SLEET...OR LIGHT FREEZING RAIN ON THURSDAY

BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ON 
FRIDAY...AND GENERALLY INDICATE THAT ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE 
EASTERN STATES AS ARCTIC AIR SLIDES SOUTHEAST OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALCHIANS AND EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY TONIGHT AND TUESDAY. 
TEMPERATURES WILL FALL INTO THE TEENS AND LOW 20S IN VALLEY 
LOCATIONS TONIGHT. HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS EVEN LOWER.

WEST TO NORTHWEST WINDS WILL CONTINUE FROM 10 TO 20 MPH WITH HIGHER 
GUSTS OVERNIGHT AND TUESDAY. THIS WILL BRING WIND CHILL VALUES DOWN 
TO JUST BELOW ZERO AT TIMES ACROSS SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN...BUT 
NOT QUITE LOW ENOUGH TO BE IN THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY RANGE. 
W TO NW FLOW IS STILL LOOKING DRY...BUT SOME LOW TO MID CLOUDS 
MOVING SOUTHEAST SHOULD MAKE SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY TUESDAY WHICH MAY 
HELP TO HOLD TEMPERATURES DOWN INTO THE TEENS HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO 
THE 20S TO LOWER 30S LOWER ELEVATIONS EXCEPT MID TO UPPER 30S SE TN 
VALLEYS.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL

SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO/TN RIVER VALLEYS DURING THE THURSDAY 
NIGHT/FRIDAY TIME FRAME...BUT SHOW SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE EXACT 
TRACK OF THIS SYSTEM. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE THAT SOME 
WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL PRODUCE SOME LIGHT 
RAIN OR SNOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. 
A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION THEN DEVELOPS THURSDAY NIGHT OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY AHEAD OF THIS DEVELOPING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...WITH THE 
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATING AN ABOVE-FREEZING 850 TO 750 MB LAYER. 
THIS WARM LAYER WILL SPREAD OVER A SUB-FREEZING SURFACE AIR MASS 
REMAINING ENTRENCHED AT THE SURFACE OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS 
SCENARIO WOULD SUGGEST THE POSSIBILITY OF A LIGHT WINTRY MIX OF 
RAIN...SLEET...OR FREEZING RAIN ON THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING 
OVER MOSTLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. LATEST ECMWF 
MODEL RUN INDICATES A MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK TO THE LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM ON FRIDAY...WHICH WOULD BRING IN COLDER AIR INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA ON FRIDAY RESULTING IN MORE SNOW THAN RAIN. SINCE THIS IS THE 
FIRST MODEL RUN TO SUGGEST A MORE SOUTHERLY TRACK OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY...WILL CONTINUE TO TREND THE FORECAST TOWARDS A WARMER 
SOLUTION OF MOSTLY RAIN FOR FRIDAY...BUT SWITCHING TO SNOW ON FRIDAY 
NIGHT BEHIND THE COLD FRONT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE

LITTLE TOO QUICKLY DURING THIS TIME FRAME SO HAD TO ADJUST SURFACE 
TEMPERATURES TO A CERTAIN DEGREE. IT LOOKS LIKE A MIXED BAG OF 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE POSSIBLE FOR A PERIOD LATER THURSDAY NIGHT

ATMOSPHERE BEFORE PRECIP CHANGES ENTIRELY BACK TO RAIN IN THIS AREA. 
EASTERN U.S. UPPER LEVEL TROUGH REALLY AMPLIFIES FRIDAY INTO

321 PM EST SUN JAN 20 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)... A PERSISTENT LONG WAVE TROUGH
WILL CONTINUE TO AFFECT THE EASTERN UNITED STATES...WITH SLIGHT
DEEPENING OF THE TROUGH ON MONDAY. THIS WILL BRING A REINFORCING
SHOT OF ARCTIC AIR TO THE AREA LATE MONDAY. THE DEEP N-NW FLOW
ALOFT REMAINS MOSTLY DRY THROUGH THE PERIOD...SO NO PRECIP IS
EXPECTED. MODELS SHOW A THIN LAYER OF MOISTURE AROUND 800 MB
TOMORROW AFTERNOON AHEAD OF THE 850-700 MB TROUGH AXIS...SO WE CAN
EXPECT A LITTLE MORE CLOUD COVER TOMORROW. THE SURFACE COLD FRONT
WILL BE CLOSE TO OUR PLATEAU AND SW VA COUNTIES BY LATE
AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING. HIGH TEMPS SHOULD REACH INTO THE MID 40S
AND LOWER 50S BEFORE DROPPING SHARPLY IN THE EVENING.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...AS LONG WAVE TROUGH
SETTLES OVER EASTERN STATES MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT VERY
COLD AND DRY AIR MASS ON N TO NW WINDS BRINGS LOWS BELOW 20 DEGREES
AND SINGLE DIGITS IN THE MOUNTAINS AND POSSIBLY HIGHER VALLEYS NE
TN AND SW VA EACH NIGHT. HIGHS TUESDAY 10 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW
NORMAL IN THE 20S AND 30S. AS TROUGH AND ARCTIC HIGH MODERATES AND
SHIFTS EAST WEDNESDAY TEMPERATURES WILL BEGIN TO WARM BACK UP WITH
HIGHS RISING ABOVE FREEZING IN MOST AREAS. WEAK SYSTEMS IN NW FLOW
MAY BRING SOME CLOUD COVER INTO THE REGION TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LOWS WILL REBOUND THURSDAY MORNING TO THE MID 20S
TO LOWER 30S AS THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM APPROACHES. THIS SYSTEM MAY
START WITH A WINTER MIX EARLY THURSDAY BUT SHOULD QUICKLY CHANGE TO
ALL RAIN BY LATE MORNING OR EARLY AFTERNOON AS A WARM FRONT PASSES
THROUGH. THE WARM PERIOD WILL BE SHORT LIVED AS THE COLD FRONT
FRIDAY CHANGES THE RAIN BACK TO SNOW ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS AND
HIGHER ELEVATIONS DURING THE DAY FRIDAY. SNOW SHOWERS WILL LINGER
WITH WRAP AROUND MOISTURE FRIDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY BEFORE
SKIES BEGIN TO CLEAR LATER SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER
COLD BLAST BEHIND THIS FRONT SATURDAY AND SUNDAY.

THE PRIMARY AVIATION CONCERN THROUGH THE NEXT 24 HOURS WILL BE FOG
DEVELOPMENT AT TRI. THE PAST FEW NIGHTS HAVE SEEN HIGHLY VARIABLE
CONDITIONS...WITH VIS DROPING INTO THE VLIFR RANGE AT TIMES. THERE
ARE NO INDICATIONS THAT TONIGHT WILL BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT.
SATELLITE IMAGERY THIS AFTERNOON CONINTUES TO SHOW SNOW COVER IN
THAT AREA...WHICH WILL ENHANCE THE CHANCE OF FOG. WILL FORECAST A
PERIOD OF LIFR CONDITIONS TONIGHT AT TRI...WITH MODERATE

A COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING ACROSS THE AREA TODAY...BUT WITH VERY
LITTLE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH AND THE ARCTIC AIR MASS LAGGING WELL
BEHIND...IT WILL HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON SENSIBLE WEATHER CONDITIONS
TODAY. THE CURRENT FORECAST OF MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND HIGHS IN THE

350 AM EST SUN JAN 20 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A MOISTURE STARVED COLD FRONT WILL 
PUSH THROUGH THE AREA TODAY. NOT MUCH COLD ADVECTION BEHIND IT AS 
STRONG PUSH OF COLDER AIR WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER THE SHORT TERM 
PERIOD.  STILL SHOULD BE QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE TODAY ALTHOUGH SOME 
STRATOCU MAY INVADE NORTHERN AREAS BRIEFLY. SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR 
SKY TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS LOOK TO BE IN THE BALL PARK OVERALL.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL 
ESTABLISH ITSELF ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. MONDAY AND TUESDAY. COLD 
AIR WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION ON MONDAY BUT WON'T BE TOO HARD TO 
TAKE AS HIGHS WILL BE RIGHT AROUND SEASONAL NORMALS FOR THE DATE. 
HOWEVER...THE PREVAILING NORTHERLY FLOW WILL PULL ARCTIC AIR ACROSS 
THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU INTO THE GREAT VALLEY AND APPALACHIAN 
MOUNTAINS LATER MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
ABOUT 15 TO 20 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON TUESDAY RANGING FROM THE 
UPPER TEENS ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND 
ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER TO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 30S ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE GREAT VALLEY. ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE OVER THE 
REGION TUESDAY NIGHT CAUSING TEMPERATURES TO FALL INTO THE TEENS 
ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION. HEIGHTS START TO BUILD WEDNESDAY INTO 
THURSDAY WITH THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM WHICH SHOULD 
ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB BACK CLOSER TO NORMAL FOR LATE JANUARY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. MODELS WERE SOMEWHAT CLOSER IN 
DEPICTION OF THE LATE WEEK WEATHER SCENARIO WHICH INCLUDES A FRONTAL 
SYSTEM APPROACHING THE REGION ON THURSDAY WITH A SURGE OF MILDER AIR 
AS SYSTEM WARM SECTOR BUILDS EAST. TWEAKED POPS UP FROM SLIGHT AND 
LOW CHANCE LATER THURSDAY AFTERNOON TO MEDIUM CHANCE BY LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND HIGH CHANCE CATEGORY FOR FRIDAY. WILL NEED TO 
WATCH NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF FREEZING OR FROZEN PRECIP OCCURRING WITH CHILLY LOW 
LEVEL AIRMASS IN PLACE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING. LOOKS 
LIKE ENOUGH WARMING FOR RAIN SHOWERS EVERYWHERE BY LATE MORNING 
FRIDAY. UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE EASTERN STATES ON FRIDAY AS 
ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPS THROUGH THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
TROUGH PULLING MUCH COLDER AIR BACK ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. WOULD EXPECT PRECIP TO CHANGE FROM RAIN SHOWERS TO SNOW 
SHOWERS WITH UPSLOPE ENHANCEMENT IN THE TERRAIN FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY. WINTERY PRECIP APPEARS LIKE IT WILL END EVERYWHERE BUT THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS ALONG THE 
NORTH CAROLINA BORDER DURING THE DAY SATURDAY. BASICALLY UNDERCUT 
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES FROM TUESDAY THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE 
FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...VISIBLE SATELLITE SHOWS A GOOD 
DEAL OF SNOW MELTING THIS AFTERNOON. BY THE END OF THE DAY...ONLY 
PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WILL HAVE 
SIGNIFICANT SNOW ON THE GROUND. THIS WILL PLAY INTO HOW MUCH FOG IS 
ANTICIPATED TONIGHT..LOWS TONIGHT AND HIGHS SUNDAY. WILL INCLUDE 
PATCHY FOG FOG TYS NORTHWARD...SOME LOCALL DENSE POSSIBLE AGAIN.

FOR HIGHS SUNDAY..WILL A DEGREE OR TWO LOWER THAN GUIDANCE FOR THE
NORTHEAST SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TODAY. A 
SHORT-WAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES WILL PULL A 
COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA SUNDAY MORNING. MOISTURE IS VERY SHALLOW 
WITH FROPA AND CONFINED TO THE BOUNDARY LAYER. WILL INCREASE CLOUD 
COVER BETWEEN 10-15Z SUNDAY FOR TYS AND TRI..THEN SUNNY AREA-WIDE. 
COLD AIR ADVECTION IS WEAK BEHIND INITIAL FRONT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...COLD AIR ADVECTION 
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY FROM ARCTIC FRONT TO BRING MUCH COLDER 
AIR MASS INTO THE REGION. LOOKS LIKE THE COLDEST OF THE WINTER AND 
IN THE PAST COUPLE YEARS. NW FLOW BEHIND FRONT WILL ALSO INCREASE 
WINDS PRODUCING WIND CHILLS IN THE SINGLE DIGITS TO BELOW ZERO IN 
THE MOUNTAINS AND NOT QUITE AS LOW IN THE VALLEYS. WENT BELOW 
GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WITH ARCTIC AIR MASS. 
LOWS WILL BE IN THE SINGLE DIGITS TO TEENS MOST PLACES MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY NIGHT. AREAS WITH LEFT OVER SNOW COVER STILL ON THE 
GROUND IN SW VA MAY BE EVEN DROP TO NEAR ZERO. TEMPERATURES BEGIN TO 
WARM WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE EASTERN 
THIRD OF THE COUNTRY BEGINS TO SHIFT EAST. THE BREAK IN THE COLD 
PATTERN WILL BE BRIEF AS NEW SHORT WAVE DIGS SOUTH ACROSS THE MID MS 
VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT AND INTO THE TN VALLEY FRIDAY. WARMING 
TEMPERATURES WILL ALLOW RAIN TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE TN VALLEY 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. HOWEVER COLD AIR TRAPPED ACROSS NE 
SECTIONS MAY ALLOW SOME FREEZING RAIN TO OCCUR LATE THURSDAY NIGHT 
AND EARLY FRIDAY BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN. FREEZING LEVELS DROP 
RAPIDLY FRIDAY NIGHT AND THE RAIN SHOULD CHANGE TO SNOW FRIDAY NIGHT 
AND CONTINUE INTO SATURDAY...AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVES IN ON THE 
BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM. A FEW INCHES OF SNOW COULD FALL ESPECIALLY 
ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS BEFORE ENDING SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL HAVE TO 
WATCH AS NEW MODEL INFORMATION COMES IN THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS 
UNCERTAINTY IN THE TIMING OF THE SYSTEM WILL AFFECT PRECIPITATION 
TYPES.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR SOUTH

AFTER MORNING FOG LIFTS SHOULD SEE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TODAY...THEN A 
MOSTLY CLEAR NIGHT TONIGHT. WILL TRIM SOME MAV MAX TEMPS JUST A BIT 
FOR TODAY...BUT OVERALL WILL STAY CLOSE BOTH PERIODS.   

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE PERIOD BEGINS WITH DRY COLD 
FRONTAL PASSAGE ON SUNDAY BUT THE STRONGEST COLD AIR ADVECTION 
BEGINS LATER SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AS THE LONG WAVE TROUGH 
OVER THE EASTERN U.S. DEEPENS WITH SHORT WAVE ENERGY BUILDING 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. MODELS 
AGREE THAT ARCTIC AIR WILL BE TAPPED ON STRENGTHENING NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW. INCREASINGLY COLDER AIR WILL LIMIT HIGH TEMPERATURES TO THE 
UPPER 30S AND 40S ON MONDAY AND MID 20S TO THE MID 30S TUESDAY WHILE 
LOW TEMPERATURES WILL BE MAINLY IN THE TEENS MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY NIGHT. GRADUAL MODERATION IN THE ARCTIC CHILL WILL OCCUR 
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AS THE UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST. A 
BRIEF PERIOD OF UPPER LEVEL RIDGING WILL BE MAINTAINED LATER 
WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY WHILE THE FORECAST AREA AWAITS THE NEXT 
STORM SYSTEM. UNCERTAINTY IN SYSTEM TIMING INCREASES AT THE END OF 
THE LONG TERM PERIOD WITH THE GFS QUITE A BIT SLOWER WITH SYSTEM 
FROPA THAN THE ECMWF. WENT MUCH CLOSER TO THE FASTER EUROPEAN MODEL 
WHICH SMOKES A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING 
THE DAY FRIDAY. USED A MEDIUM RANGE CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR SHOWERS 
FOR THE EVENT WITH A BIT OF SNOW MIXED IN WITH THE RAIN FOR 
PRE-FRONTAL PRECIP LATE THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING 
DEVELOPING OVER STILL CHILLY AIR RESIDING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. RAIN WOULD LIKELY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW 
SHOWERS AREA WIDE FRIDAY NIGHT AS MUCH COLDER AIR FILLS IN BEHIND 
THE DEPARTING COLD FRONT WITH PLENTY OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPPING 
INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE LONG WAVE TROUGH. UNDERCUT MEX MOS TEMP 
GUIDANCE A FAIR AMOUNT ON MONDAY WITH FRONT MOVING IN EARLY IN THE

NUMBERS THROUGH MUCH OF THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST.

1005 PM EST FRI JAN 18 2013

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. MINOR UPWARD ADJUSTMENT TO TEMPS 
AND DEW POINTS. SOME ICY ROADS EXPECTED AND PATCHY FREEZING FOG. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...SNOW MELT UNDERWAY THIS 
AFTERNOON WITH SOME LAST REMNANT OF LOW CLOUDS HANGING ON AT 
LONESOME PINE (LNP) IN WISE COUNTY VA. AREAS OF NE TN AND SW VA THAT 
GOT HEAVIER SNOWS WERE STRUGGLING TO GET OUT OF THE MID 30S.

FORECAST SEEMS STRAIGHT FORWARD FOR TONIGHT...ALTHO THE MELTING SNOW 
SHOULD KEEP THE BOUNDARY LAYER MOIST...SO I ADDED PATCHY AREAS OF 
FOG FOR TRI INTO SW VA. MOS DEW POINT TEMPS WERE RUNNING A FEW TO 
SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW ACTUAL DEW POINT TEMPS...SO SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS 
WERE MADE THROUGH TONIGHT. MOS MINS...MAINLY THE COOLER GFS...LOOKED 
QUITE REASONABLE.

PLENTY OF SUNSHINE ON TAP FOR SATURDAY WITH S-SW LOW LEVEL FLOW 
RETURNING...SO EXPECT A GREAT DEAL OF THE REMAINING SNOW TO MELT 
AWAY. HIGHS IN THE 40S TO MID 50S LOOKS RIGHT ON TRACK.

MOTORISTS SHOULD WATCH FOR ANY WET AREAS TO ICE OVER AGAIN TONIGHT
ESPECIALLY OVER THE SECONDARY AND BACK ROADS OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
AREAS. THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE HWO PRODUCT AND WILL ALSO ISSUE A 
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT (SPS). 


LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SFC RIDGE WILL 
CONTINUE TO SLIDE OFF TO OUR EAST ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY. 
A LOW AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND 
NEW ENGLAND AREA ON SUNDAY WITH A COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDS DOWN 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. DUE TO THE FAR NORTHERN LOCATION 
OF THE SHORT WAVE...THE FRONT WILL NOT BRING MUCH OF AN AIRMASS 
CHANGE ACROSS OUR AREA. THE FRONT SHOULD ONLY KNOCK BACK TEMPS A FEW 
DEGREES OFF SATURDAY'S HIGHS. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW FROM SATURDAY 
SHIFTS TO A NORTHWEST FLOW ON SUNDAY AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT. 
SOME OF THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON BUILDS INTO THE REGION ON 
MONDAY AS MORE ENERGY DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF CENTRAL CANADA. AN 
ARCTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL SHOVE IT'S WAY INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE DAY INITIATING THE BEGINNING OF A VERY 
COLD PERIOD. LATEST NAM AND GFS DIFFER ON THE ARRIVAL TIME OF THE 
FRONT. THE NAME BRINGS IT IN AROUND 18Z WHILE THE GFS IS CLOSER TO 
00Z. THE TIMING WILL EFFECT HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR THE DAY ON MONDAY. 
TRENDING TOWARD THE GFS AND ITS LATER ARRIVAL SOLUTION AT THIS 
TIME...THUS GOING WITH WARMER TEMPS. HIGHS WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTED 
DOWN IF THE NAM IS CORRECT WITH ITS EARLIER ARRIVAL. TEMPS WILL BE 
AROUND 10 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON TUESDAY AS NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW CONTINUES ALOFT. THE COLD NORTHERLY FLOW WILL BE A BIT TOO DRY 
FOR PRECIPITATION. BY WEDNESDAY HEIGHTS START TO SLOWLY BUILD AS THE 
EASTERN U.S. TROUGH MOVES OUT TO SEA. THE MID JANUARY CHILL WILL 
MODERATE TO SOME DEGREE ON WEDNESDAY AS THE COLDEST AIR SHIFTS EAST. 
FURTHER WARMING IS EXPECTED ON THURSDAY DUE TO THE APPROACH OF AN 
UPPER TROUGH THROUGH THE WESTERN STATES. THIS SYSTEM MOVES RAPIDLY 
EAST WITH A SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. EDGED POPS UP 
SLIGHTLY TO LOW CHANCE LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT BUILDS 
TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. CHANCE POPS ON FRIDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
EVENING AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. PRECIP STARTS TO EXIT 
THE AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SAT MORNING. USED LIQUID PRECIP FOR 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA BUT HAD TO APPLY SOME SNOW TO PARTS OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WITH THE SYSTEM MOVING IN 
DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND EXITING DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS ON 
FRIDAY. CONCERNING THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST FOR THIS PACKAGE...HAD 
TO UNDERCUT GUIDANCE THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM WHICH LOOKS LIKE 
IT MAY NOT HANDLE THE FRIGID ARCTIC AIR VERY WELL.

RETURNING...SO EXPECT A GREAT DEAL OF THE REMAINING SNOW TO MELT 
AWAY. HIGHS IN THE 40S TO MID 50S LOOKS RIGHT ON TRACK.

MOTORISTS SHOULD WATCH FOR ANY WET AREAS TO ICE OVER AGAIN TONIGHT
ESPECIALLY OVER THE SECONDARY AND BACK ROADS OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
AREAS. THIS WAS HIGHLIGHTED IN THE HWO PRODUCT AND WILL ALSO ISSUE A 
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT (SPS). 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SFC RIDGE WILL CONTINUE 
TO SLIDE OFF TO OUR EAST ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND INTO SUNDAY. A LOW 
AMPLITUDE SHORT WAVE TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND NEW 
ENGLAND AREA ON SUNDAY WITH A COLD FRONT THAT EXTENDS DOWN THROUGH 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. DUE TO THE FAR NORTHERN LOCATION OF THE 
SHORT WAVE...THE FRONT WILL NOT BRING MUCH OF AN AIRMASS CHANGE 
ACROSS OUR AREA. THE FRONT SHOULD ONLY KNOCK BACK TEMPS A FEW 
DEGREES OFF SATURDAY'S HIGHS. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW FROM SATURDAY 
SHIFTS TO A NORTHWEST FLOW ON SUNDAY AFTER THE PASSAGE OF THE FRONT. 
SOME OF THE COLDEST AIR OF THE SEASON BUILDS INTO THE REGION ON 
MONDAY AS MORE ENERGY DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF CENTRAL CANADA. AN 
ARCTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL SHOVE IT'S WAY INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE DAY INITIATING THE BEGINNING OF A VERY 
COLD PERIOD. LATEST NAM AND GFS DIFFER ON THE ARRIVAL TIME OF THE 
FRONT. THE NAME BRINGS IT IN AROUND 18Z WHILE THE GFS IS CLOSER TO 
00Z. THE TIMING WILL EFFECT HIGH TEMPERATURES FOR THE DAY ON MONDAY. 
TRENDING TOWARD THE GFS AND ITS LATER ARRIVAL SOLUTION AT THIS 
TIME...THUS GOING WITH WARMER TEMPS. HIGHS WILL NEED TO BE ADJUSTED 
DOWN IF THE NAM IS CORRECT WITH ITS EARLIER ARRIVAL. TEMPS WILL BE 
AROUND 10 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL ON TUESDAY AS NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW CONTINUES ALOFT. THE COLD NORTHERLY FLOW WILL BE A BIT TOO DRY 
FOR PRECIPITATION. BY WEDNESDAY HEIGHTS START TO SLOWLY BUILD AS THE 
EASTERN U.S. TROUGH MOVES OUT TO SEA. THE MID JANUARY CHILL WILL 
MODERATE TO SOME DEGREE ON WEDNESDAY AS THE COLDEST AIR SHIFTS EAST. 
FURTHER WARMING IS EXPECTED ON THURSDAY DUE TO THE APPROACH OF AN 
UPPER TROUGH THROUGH THE WESTERN STATES. THIS SYSTEM MOVES RAPIDLY 
EAST WITH A SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM MAKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. EDGED POPS UP 
SLIGHTLY TO LOW CHANCE LATE THURSDAY NIGHT AS A COLD FRONT BUILDS 
TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. CHANCE POPS ON FRIDAY THROUGH FRIDAY 
EVENING AS THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. PRECIP STARTS TO EXIT 
THE AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SAT MORNING. USED LIQUID PRECIP FOR 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA BUT HAD TO APPLY SOME SNOW TO PARTS OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WITH THE SYSTEM MOVING IN 
DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS AND EXITING DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS ON 
FRIDAY. CONCERNING THE TEMPERATURE FORECAST FOR THIS PACKAGE...HAD 
TO UNDERCUT GUIDANCE THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM WHICH LOOKS LIKE 
IT MAY NOT HANDLE THE FRIGID ARCTIC AIR VERY WELL.

359 PM EST THU JAN 17 2013

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...STORM SYSTEM NOW OVER THE
AREA. DYNAMIC COOLING HAS TURNED LEADING EDGE PRECIPITATION TO
SNOW...AND EVEN SOME THUNDER SNOW IN SOME PLACES. WRAP AROUND
PRECIP HAS CLOSED THE GAP AND AND IS WORKING ITS WAY TO THE
NORTHEAST...AND IS ABOUT HALF WAY THROUGH THE AREA. SYSTEM IS
CHUGGING ALONG...WITH THE EXPIRATION TIME OF 10PM FOR WINTER STORM
WARNING...LOOKING ON TRACK. HAVE BUMPED UP SNOW VALUES FROM KNOX
NORTHWARD BY ABOUT AN INCH OR SO...AND ADDED WORDING OF LOCALLY
HEAVIER AMOUNTS IN LOCAL SNOW BANDS. SOME ROADS GETTING COATED WITH
RAPID SNOWS EVEN IN VALLEY...THINK SOME MELTING WILL OCCUR WHEN
SNOW SLOWS DOWN AND TERRESTRIAL WARMING CATCHES UP.

WENT 1-2 DEGREES HIGHER THAN MIN TEMPS DUE TO WINDS AND MOISTURE
TONIGHT...AND WENT ABOUT 3 DEGREES COOLER THAN MAX TEMPS FOR FRIDAY
DUE TO SATURATED GROUNDS USING UP A LOT OF ENERGY VIA EVAPORATION.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS STILL IN GOOD
AGREEMENT FOR DRY AND COOL PATTERN TO CONTINUE THROUGH THE WEEKEND
AND THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. ONE WEAK COLD FRONT TO PASS
THROUGH SUNDAY AND THEN ANOTHER FRONT LATE MONDAY THAT WILL BRING A
FEW MORE CLOUDS INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS. REMOVED PRECIPITATION
CHANCES FOR MONDAY NIGHT AS LESS MOISTURE AVAILABLE IN DRY AIR
MASS. ANOTHER POSSIBLE QUICK MOVING SYSTEM TUESDAY NIGHT NOW LOOKS
TOO DRY FOR ANY PRECIPITATION. NEXT SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM TO SPREAD
CLOUDS IN THURSDAY WITH CHANCE OF RAIN THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY
JUST OUTSIDE THE 7 DAY FORECAST. LOWS FRIDAY NIGHT QUITE COLD AND
MAY BE EVEN COLDER DEPENDING ON SNOW DEPTH FRIDAY MORNING AND HOW
MUCH MELTING OCCURS. HIGHS SATURDAY 5 TO 10 DEGREES WARMER AS
SOUTHERLY WINDS DEVELOP AS HIGH PRESSURE AREA MOVES EAST. AGAIN
HIGHS MAY BE AFFECTED BY SNOW COVER BUT FULL SUN IS EXPECTED.
SATURDAY NIGHT LOWS SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER BUT STILL MOSTLY
BELOW FREEZING. SUNDAY HIGHS START A COOLING TREND AS SOME CLOUD
COVER MOVE IN AND COLD FRONT BRINGS RE-INFORCING SHOT OF COLD AIR.
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY COLDER TEMPERATURES CONTINUE BEHIND COLD
FRONT. THIS PATTERN CONTINUES MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. SOME
HIGHS TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS BELOW
FREEZING. THURSDAY TEMPERATURES WARM TO THE MID 40S TO NEAR 50 AHEAD
OF NEXT SYSTEM AS HIGH PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST AND SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST
FLOW SETS UP.

INTENSE LITTLE LOW PRESSURE CENTER NOW HEADED TOWARD THE AREA.
EXPECT THE CENTER TO PASS SOUTH OF THE AREA...BUT WITH
PRECIPITATION STREAMING TO THE NORTH. CIRCULATION AROUND LOW WILL
ALSO TRY TO BRING UP SOME WARM AIR INTO THE REGION...THAT WILL MEAN
A MIXED PRECIP RAIN...SLEET...SNOW AT TIMES UNTIL LOW GETS FARTHER
TO THE EAST. GAP CURRENTLY SEEN BETWEEN RAIN IN E TN AND SNOW IN
FARTHER WEST. THIS GAP IS EXPECTED TO CLOSE...ESPECIALLY FOR THE
NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA...THIS IS WHERE THE MIXED PRECIP IS MOST
LIKELY. FARTHER SOUTH...THE GAP WILL BE SLOWER TO FILL...AND SO FOR
KCHA THERE IS A BREAK IN THE PRECIP STARTING NOW FOR A FEW HOURS.  

WITH THE MIXING OF SLEET...HAVE TRIMMED BACK THE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS
A SLIGHT AMOUNT OVER THE AREA...BUT STILL KEEPING WARNINGS AND
ADVISORIES INTACT.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
325 AM EST THU JAN 17 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...VERY DYNAMIC SYSTEM WILL LIFT 
NORTHEAST FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS TODAY AND EXIT THE AREA EARLY TONIGHT. DOUBLE JET 
STRUCTURE ALOFT WILL PRODUCE LARGE SCALE ASCENT WITH STRONG Q-VECTOR 
FORCING MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY. STRONG AGEOSTROPHIC 
CIRCULATION ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER JET WILL ENHANCE FRONTO-GENETIC 
FORCING ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE STRONG FORCING WILL 
PRODUCE DYNAMIC COOLING OVER THE AREA WHICH IS EVIDENT BY THE 850MB 
TEMPERATURES. 

THE STRONG LIFT AND TAP OF GULF MOISTURE DUE TO DEVELOPING 
CYCLOGENESIS OVER GEORGIA WILL PRODUCE ANOTHER ROUND OF MODERATE 
RAINFALL WITH 1 TO 2 INCHES OF PRECIPITATION ANTICIPATED WITH 
HEAVIER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE ALONG THE TENNESSEE AND NORTH CAROLINA 
STATE-LINE. DUE TO THE RETURN OF SIGNIFICANT RAINS...ADDITIONAL 
FLOODING CONCERNS ARE POSSIBLE..SO WILL MAINTAIN FLOOD WATCH.

NAM AND GFS BUFR SOUNDINGS SHOW HOW THE DYNAMIC COOLING REDUCES THE 
TEMPERATURE PROFILE QUICKLY LATE THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON. THE 
COOLING WILL ALLOW THE RAIN TO CHANGE TO SNOW TODAY..ESPECIALLY THIS 
AFTERNOON. HAVE MAINTAINED WINTER STORM WARNING FOR THE MOUNTAINS 
(SNOWFALL OF 6 TO 12 INCHES) AND ISSUED WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES 
ELSEWHERE FOR 1 TO 4 INCHES. FOR THE VALLEY...MAIN ACCUMULATION WILL 
BE ON GRASSY SURFACES...BUT MAY BE SOME TRAVEL PROBLEMS DURING THE 
AFTERNOON RUSH HOUR.

SYSTEM QUICKLY MOVES EAST FOR THIS EVENING WITH PRECIPITATION ENDING 
BY MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT A DRY AND TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN WILL DEVELOP FOR THE WEEKEND 
AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH BELOW NORMAL TEMPS EXPECTED FOR 
EARLY NEXT WEEK AS A PAIR OF COLD FRONTS MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA. THE FIRST COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING TIME FRAME. 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL HAVE LIMITED 
MOISTURE AND WEAK UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS ASSOCIATED WITH IT...SO 
EXPECTING MAINLY JUST AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS. ANOTHER COLD FRONT WITH 
STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS IS THEN PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT...AND COULD CREATE A FEW SNOW 
SHOWERS OVER MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE 
ECMWF MODEL SOLUTION.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
345 PM EST WED JAN 16 2013

.NEAR TERM (TONIGHT)...PLUME OF MOISTURE WITH CURRENT EVENT
CONTINUES TO FADE THIS AFTERNOON...AND IT SHOULD CONTINUE INTO THIS
EVENING. THERE SHOULD BE NO FURTHER CONTRIBUTION TO FLOODING
THROUGH THIS EVENING. PLAN TO LET FLOOD ADVISORIES OVER WESTERN
AREAS EXPIRE AT 4PM. FLOOD WATCH WILL CONTINUE AS IT STANDS THROUGH
THURSDAY.

NEXT SYSTEM...LAST SYSTEM IN THIS SERIES...WILL BE AFFECTING THE 
AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH RAINS SPREADING ACROSS THE SOUTH BEFORE 
DAYBREAK.  TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY STAY ABOVE FREEZING OVERNIGHT 
ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA.  NOT EXPECTING ANY WINTRY PRECIP OVERNIGHT. 

.SHORT TERM (THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT)...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
WILL DEVELOP AND MOVE ALONG THE APPALACHIANS ON THURSDAY.  THIS WILL 
BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF WIDESPREAD RAIN INTO THE AREA TUESDAY 
MORNING. AN ADDITIONAL RAINFALL OF 1 TO 2 INCHES IS POSSIBLE...AND 
THIS WILL CONTINUE FLOODING CONCERNS THROUGH THE DAY THURSDAY.  A 
FLOOD WATCH REMAINS IN EFFECT THROUGH 00Z FRIDAY.  AIR MASS WILL 
COOL QUICKLY THURSDAY AFTERNOON ALLOWING RAIN TO TRANSITION TO 
SNOW.  WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE DECREASING AS THE COOLER AIR MOVES IN 
COMBINED WITH A WARM GROUND...SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ALONG THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE TN VALLEY SHOULD REMAIN BELOW ADVISORY 
CRITERIA.  THE TRI-CITIES AREA AND THE LOWER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VA 
MAY SEE ACCUMULATIONS HIGH ENOUGH FOR A SNOW ADVISORY...BUT WILL 
WAIT FOR LATER MODEL RUNS BEFORE THAT CAN BE DETERMINED.  WITH DEEP 
MOISTURE LINGERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS AS THE COLD AIR MOVES 
IN...ANTICIPATE BRIEF HEAVY SNOW ACROSS THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS AND 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SOUTHWEST VA.  ACCUMULATIONS OF 4 TO 8 INCHES 
MAY QUICKLY ACCUMULATE THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND INTO THE EVENING.  
SNOW WILL TAPPER OFF TO FLURRIES AND THEN EXIT THE AREA OVERNIGHT AS 
THE LOW PULLS AWAY FROM THE REGION.  A WINTER WATCH WARNING WILL BE 
ISSUED FOR THIS AREA.  ADDITIONALLY...AS THE SYSTEM MOVES ACROSS THE 
REGION...WINDS WILL INCREASE...ESPECIALLY OVER HIGHER ELEVATION.  
THIS MAY CAUSE SOME DRIFTING OF SNOW AND OCCASIONALLY REDUCE 
VISIBILITIES.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A MUCH DIFFERENT PATTERN IS IN 
STORE FROM WHAT WE HAVE RECENTLY BEEN EXPERIENCING. MODELS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT THAT A DRY AND TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN WILL DEVELOP 
BY THE END OF THE WEEK...AS HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY. THE BRIEF RETURN OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO 
JUMP UP INTO LOW TO MID 50'S ON SATURDAY BEFORE THE ARRIVAL OF A 
WEAK COLD FRONT THAT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST 
AREA DURING THE SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING TIME FRAME. MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL HAVE LIMITED MOISTURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH IT...SO EXPECTING MAINLY JUST AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS. 
MUCH COLDER AIR WILL BEGIN TO SPILL DOWN FROM CANADA WITH THE 
ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT COLD FRONT THAT IS PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT. ALONG WITH COLDER TEMPS...THERE 
SHOULD BE ENOUGH MOISTURE AND LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT FOR A 
CHANCE OF SOME SNOW SHOWERS OVER MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY TIME FRAME. A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS CAN'T BE RULED OUT ACROSS PORTIONS OF THE 
CENTRAL VALLEY. FROM TUESDAY NIGHT ONWARD...HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
SLOWLY BEGIN TO BUILD BACK IN AND CONTINUE THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
EXTENDED. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND A LITTLE COOLER THAN THE 
00Z GFSX GUIDANCE THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN BETTER 
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

335 AM EST WED JAN 16 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...ACTIVE FORECAST 
CONTINUES AS THE STRONG FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING THAT HAS PRODUCED THE 
HEAVY RAINFALL EVENT OVER THE AREA WEAKENS TODAY. HOWEVER...UPPER 
TROUGH...CURRENTLY OVER TEXAS...LIFTS EAST NORTHEAST TOWARD THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR THURSDAY. NAM AND GFS MODELS ARE IN PRETTY 
GOOD AGREEMENT IN SHOWING STRONG DYNAMIC FORCING MOVING INTO THE 
AREA FOR THURSDAY. DOUBLE JET STRUCTURE WILL PRODUCE STRONG LIFT 
WITH AGEOSTROPHIC CIRCULATION ENHANCING FRONTO-GENETIC FORCING 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. CROSS-SECTION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS SHOWS DEEP STRONG OMEGA WHICH WILL PRODUCE DYNAMIC 
COOLING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

THE FORECAST OF 850 MB TEMPERATURES SHOW THIS DYNAMIC COOLING QUITE 
WELL WITH TEMPERATURES CHILLING OFF QUICKLY THURSDAY. HEAVY 
PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS OF 1 1/2 TO 2 1/2 INCHES FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
AND THURSDAY WILL PROLONG FLOODING CONCERNS...SO HAVE EXTENDED FLOOD 
WATCH THROUGH 00Z FRIDAY. THE MAIN CONCERN FOR FLOODING WILL BE 
ACROSS THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS WITH ADDITIONAL RIVER 
FLOODING POSSIBLE.

THE DYNAMIC COOLING WILL ALLOW THE RAIN TO CHANGE TO SNOW ACROSS 
MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH A PERIOD OF HEAVY SNOW POSSIBLE 
ACROSS THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MOUNTAINS. 
HAVE ISSUED A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR HEAVY SNOWFALL OF 4 TO 8 INCHES 
WITH HEAVIER AMOUNTS UP TO 1 FOOT OVER THE HIGHEST TERRAIN OF THE 
EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. FOR THE VALLEY...SUCH AS THE 
TRI-CITIES...RAIN WILL LIKELY CHANGE TO SNOW WITH ACCUMULATIONS 
ANTICIPATED. A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY MAY BE NEEDED FOR THE 
TRI-CITIES..PLATEAU AND VALLEYS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FOR THURSDAY.

UPPER TROUGH EXITS THE AREA FOR THURSDAY NIGHT WITH PRECIPITATION 
ENDING

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT A DRY AND TRANQUIL WEATHER PATTERN WILL DEVELOP BY THE END OF 
THE WEEK...AS HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY. A WEAK 
COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
DURING THE SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING TIME FRAME. MODELS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS COLD FRONT WILL HAVE LIMITED MOISTURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH IT...SO EXPECTING MAINLY JUST AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS. 
ANOTHER STRONGER COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT...BRINGING MUCH COLDER TEMPS AND A 
CHANCE FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS OVER MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND A LITTLE COOLER 
THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH IS IN

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATED
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
944 PM EST TUE JAN 15 2013

.DISCUSSION...
RAIN WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT FROM
THE SOUTH AND WEST...PRODUCING AN ADDITIONAL 1-2 INCHES ACROSS THE
REGION /WITH PERHAPS A FEW LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS IN SOME AREAS/.
THE REGION HAS RECEIVED SEVERAL INCHES OF RAINFALL OVER THE PAST 48
HOURS OR SO...WITH TOTALS RANGING BETWEEN 3-6 INCHES IN MANY
AREAS. THESE RAINFALL ACCUMULATIONS HAVE BEEN GRADUAL...BUT THEY
HAVE ADDED UP OVER TIME AND HAVE CREATED SOME SIGNIFICANT FLOODING
CONCERNS AS EXCESSIVE RUNOFF AS CAUSED THE FLOODING OF CREEKS AND
STREAMS...ROADS/UNDERPASSES AND OTHER LOW-LYING LOCATIONS AREAWIDE.
AS A RESULT...A FLOOD WARNING IS IN EFFECT FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST
AREA THROUGH TOMORROW MORNING. DEPENDING ON THE LATEST TRENDS...
THIS WARNING MAY NEED TO BE EXTENDED FURTHER...BUT WILL LET THE
NEXT SHIFT EVALUATE THAT. 

THE OTHER FORECAST CONCERN FOR THE EVENING WAS TEMPERATURES ON THE
BACKSIDE OF THE FRONT ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU. A FEW HIGHER
ELEVATIONS AREAS THERE WILL LIKELY FLIRT WITH THE FREEZING MARK
OVERNIGHT...RESULTING IN SOME INTERMITTENT PERIODS OF LIGHT
FREEZING RAIN. THIS COULD RESULT IN SOME PATCHY SLIPPERY ROADS IN
THESE AREAS OVERNIGHT. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE ISOLATED NATURE OF THIS
/AS MOST LOCATIONS IN THESE ZONES WILL EXPERIENCE MID/UPPER 30
TEMPERATURES AND RAIN/ HAVE OPTED TO HANDLE WITH AN SPS THROUGH
13Z. OVERALL...THE FORECAST CONTINUES TO LOOK WET TONIGHT AND INTO
THE DAY TMRW SO THOSE WITH TRAVEL PLANS SHOUILD DEFINITELY STAY
AWARE OF THE LATEST CONDITIONS AND USE CAUTION /ESPECIALLY AT
NIGHT/ GIVEN THE HIGH THREAT CONTINUED FLOODING AREAWIDE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...WET SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT
WILL CONTINUE. THUS RAIN WILL CONTINUE. WE FIND OURSELVES ON THE
COOL SIDE OF A STATIONARY SURFACE FRONT...AND EXPECT TEMPERATURES
TO MOVE ONLY VERY SLOWLY. RAINFALL AMOUNTS THROUGH SUNRISE MAY BE 
ANOTHER INCH OR TWO ON THE AVERAGE. INTENSITY WILL GREATLY
DIMINISH BY LATE WEDNESDAY MORNING. ALSO ANTICIPATING THE MOIST
CONDITIONS TO CONTRIBUTE TO AREAS OF REDUCED VISIBILITY IN FOG.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH AXIS AND 
SURFACE RIDGING MOVE IN WED NGT WITH A DECREASE IN PRECIPITATION AND 
THE ONSET OF COLD AIR ADVECTION. THE NAM MODEL CONTINUES TO BE MORE 
AGGRESSIVE WITH THE SHORT-WAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO GA ON THU. LEANED AWAY FROM NAM TO A MORE 
SOUTHERLY SOLUTION. STRONG JET SEGMENT EAST OF THE SHORTWAVE WILL 
BRING A RETURN OF DEEPER MOISTURE AND AN INCREASE IN PRECIPITATION. 
WENT BELOW MOS TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE EXPECTING STRONGER COLD AIR 
ADVECTION THU AS COLD CORE ALOFT SHIFTS EAST. FREEZING LEVEL WILL 
DROP TO AROUND 2000 BY LATE THU AFTN. RAIN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW BY 
THU AFTN AS BRUNT OF MOISTURE SHIFTS EAST. LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
CAN BE EXPECTED ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF EAST TN AND SW NC. 

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND A DRY AIRMASS SETTLE INTO THE AREA THROUGH 
THE WEEKEND. UPPER TROUGH BUILDS ALONG WEST COAST WITH BROAD 
TROUGHING OVER THE EASTERN 2/3RD OF NA. STRONG COLD FRONT MOVES 
THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS EARLY NEXT WEEK. BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
ARE PROGGED WITH LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS POSSIBLE...MAINLY ACROSS SW

RAIN CONTINUES. MAYBE A LITTLE SUGGESTION THAT THE DIGGING TROUGH
OVER THE SOUTHWEST STATES MAY LAG A TAD AND PERHAPS ASSIST OUR RAIN
BAND TO SHIFT A LITTLE WEST...WHICH MIGHT HELP ALLEVIATE A LITTLE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY GENERALLY ALONG 
THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A SHARP 
CONTRAST IN TEMPS FROM EAST TO WEST ACROSS THIS BOUNDARY. IN FACT... 
TEMPS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE MID 30S AROUND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU... 
WHICH MAY POSE A PROBLEM WITH FREEZING RAIN IF ANY MORE COLD AIR 
ADVECTION OCCURS. OVERALL...NOT EXPECTING ANY PROBLEMS WITH FREEZING 
TEMPS...BUT WILL HAVE TO CONTINUE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THINGS THIS 
MORNING. A RAINY PERIOD WILL CONTINUE FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AS A 
DEEP AND UNSEASONABLY MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW (ORIGINATING FROM THE 
EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN) CONTINUES OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A 
DECENT AREA OF LIFT OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA...WHICH SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A WIDESPREAD LIGHT TO MODERATE RAINFALL THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY MORNING. WILL PLAN TO EXPAND THE FLOOD WATCH TO INCLUDE 
SOUTHWEST VA...SINCE THE MODELS INDICATE BETTER LIFT OVER THIS AREA 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH NO DOWNSLOPING FLOW EXPECTED. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE. OVERALL...NOT EXPECTING MUCH 
OF A DIURNAL RANGE BETWEEN THE HIGHS AND LOWS FOR THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...THE NAM MODEL CONTINUES TO BE 
MORE AGGRESSIVE WITH THE SHORT-WAVE TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE NORTHERN GULF COAST STATES FOR THURSDAY. 
GFS AND ECMWF ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT IN PULLING MOISTURE BACK INTO 
THE SOUTHERN AND EASTERN FORECAST AREA..SO WILL UP POPS FOR 
CAT-LIKELY FOR SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND ALONG THE TENNESSEE/NORTH 
CAROLINA STATE-LINE FOR THURSDAY. VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE SHOWS 
A POTENTIAL MIX OF RAIN/SNOW FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BY LATE 
THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF THE FAR EASTERN MOUNTAINS ARE POSSIBLE LATE THURSDAY 
AND THURSDAY NIGHT.

FOR FRIDAY...SHORT-WAVE QUICKLY MOVES EAST OF THE AREA WITH UPPER 
FLOW BECOMING MORE WEST-NORTHWEST WITH WELCOME PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER 
FOR FRIDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. GFS/ECMWF SHOW ARCTIC AIR SPILLING INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR LATE WEEKEND/EARLY NEXT WEEK. TIMING OF COLDER 
AIR IS DIFFERENT BETWEEN MODELS. ALSO...THE ECMWF MODEL SHOWS 
POTENTIAL OF PRECIPITATION WITH ARCTIC FRONT FOR MONDAY 
NIGHT/TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL HOLD ITS 
POSITION ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS DURING THE NEXT 24 
HOURS. ATMOSPHERE WILL REMAIN VERY MOIST WITH PACIFIC AIR FEEDING 
THE UPPER LEVELS AND THE GULF OF MEXICO SUPPLYING A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WHICH WILL BE LIFTED ISENTROPICALLY OVER THE 
COOLER AIRMASS OVER THE GREAT VALLEY. IN ADDITION...SEVERAL 
DISTURBANCES WILL RIDE NORTHEAST OUT OF THE BASE OF THE BROAD 
WESTERN AND PLAINS STATES UPPER TROUGH ENHANCING LIFT THROUGHOUT THE 
PERIOD. PRECIPITABLE WATER QUITE IMPRESSIVE FOR JANUARY IN THE 1.5 
TO 2 INCH RANGE THROUGH TUESDAY AFTERNOON. WILL KEEP FLOOD WATCH IN 
PLACE FOR EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA THROUGH 
TUESDAY NIGHT. HAVE ALREADY SEEN WIDESPREAD 1 TO 2 INCH RAINFALL 
TOTALS ACROSS MUCH OF THE WATCH AREA WITH SOME LOCALLY HIGHER 
AMOUNTS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. WOULD EXPECT AN ADDITIONAL 1 TO 
AT LEAST 1.5 INCHES ACROSS THE REGION TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. THE 
OTHER ASPECT TO THE SYSTEM IS THE THREAT OF BEING A LITTLE TOO CLOSE 
TO THE CHILLY AIRMASS BANKED UP AGAINST THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. 
HOWEVER...BELIEVE THE TERRAIN MAY BE TOO MUCH TO OVERCOME KEEPING 
THE SUB-FREEZING AIR OUT ACROSS MIDDLE AND WESTERN TENNESSEE AND 
THEREFORE ONLY LIQUID PRECIP FOR THE FORECAST AREA. THERE WILL NOT 
BE MUCH MOVEMENT IN TEMPERATURES TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY WITH LOWS 
IN THE MID AND UPPER 30S ON THE PLATEAU AND LOW TO MID 40S 
ELSEWHERE. WE MAY ONLY SEE ABOUT A FIVE DEGREE RISE ON TUESDAY WITH 
HIGHS MAINLY IN THE 40S.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE SETUP FOR HEAVY 
RAINFALL WILL CONTINUE EARLY...WITH DEEP MOISTURE REMAINING IN PLACE 
ACROSS THE REGION AND A STALLED COLD FRONT DRAPED ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS...COMBINED WITH 
INCREASED UPPER-LEVEL LIFT FROM AN INTENSIFYING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL HELP TO GENERATE SEVERAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. WITH PWATS PROGGED TO BE AOA 1.2-1.5 INCHES...THESE SHOWERS 
WILL BE VERY EFFICIENT RAIN PRODUCERS WITH STORM TOTAL AMOUNTS 
APPROACHING 2-4 INCHES THROUGH WEDNESDAY IN SOME 
AREAS...PARTICULARLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE EAST 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. THIS PROLONGED HEAVY RAINFALL COULD LEAD TO 
SIGNIFICANT RUNOFF ISSUES IN AREAS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND 
FLOODING CONCERNS ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE AREA...ESPECIALLY IN 
URBANIZED AREAS AND LOCATIONS NEAR CREEKS/STREAMS. A FLOOD WATCH IS 
IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS POTENTIAL IN 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. HAVE GONE CATEGORICAL POPS AREAWIDE FOR 
BOTH PERIODS...BEFORE TAPERING THEM TO CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE ON 
WEDNESDAY. AMP

.(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...THE UPPER JET AXIS WILL SHIFT 
EAST OF THE MRX CWA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LAYER RELATIVE HUMIDITY WILL 
DROP OFF SIGNIFICANTLY. RELEASING CUT OFF LOW WEAKENS AS IT MOVES 
THROUGH GA ON THURSDAY. INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH WILL EXTEND NORTH TO 
EXTREME SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. PRECIPITATION CHANCES INCREASE THU 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS SOUTHERN MRX CWA. FREEZING LEVEL DROPS THU NIGHT. 
PRECIPITATION WILL CHANGE TO SNOW AS PRECIPITATION TAPERS OFF AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. LARGE SCALE TROUGHING BEGINS TAKING SHAPE INTO THE OH AND 
TN VALLEYS INTO NEXT WEEK. A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL LINGER 
IN THE AREA UNTIL A COLD FRONTAL PASSAGE LATE SUNDAY/EARLY MONDAY. SON

.DISCUSSION...MAIN IDEA OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK THIS MORNING WITH
A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF SOME FLOODING ALONG WATER WAYS AND IN OTHER
LOW LYING AREAS DURING THE NEXT 24-48 HOURS ACROSS EAST TENNESSEE
AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. RADAR ESTIMATES AND GROUND TRUTH 
INDICATE A GOOD INCH TO INCH AND A HALF RAINFALL TOTALS ACROSS
MOST OF THE SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH SOME
LOCALLY HIGHER TOTALS. ENHANCEMENT OCCURRING ACROSS THE NORTHEAST
HALF OF THE WATCH AREA THIS MORNING AFTER THE NICE WATERING ACROSS
SOUTHWESTERN SECTIONS DURING THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. WE SHOULD SEE THE
NEXT WAVE WITH DECENT OMEGA BUILD NORTHEAST INTO SOUTHERN SECTIONS
OF THE FORECAST AREA LATER THIS AFTERNOON WITH THE LIFT
OVERSPREADING THE REMAINDER OF THE FLOOD WATCH AREA TONIGHT INTO
TUESDAY. THEREFORE WILL KEEP THE WATCH GOING AND WILL NEED TO TWEAK
TEMPERATURES BACK A BIT TODAY WITH LITTLE IN THE WAY OF WARMING OFF
CURRENT READINGS EXPECTED.

335 AM EST MON JAN 14 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH A 
SHARP CONTRAST IN TEMPS ACROSS THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY. IN 
FACT...TEMPS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE UPPER 30S ACROSS THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...WHICH MAY POSE A PROBLEM WITH FREEZING RAIN IF ANY MORE 
COLD AIR ADVECTION OCCURS. TEMPS OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ARE 
EXPECTED TO BOTTOM OUT AROUND THE MID 30S THIS MORNING...SO NOT 
EXPECTING ANY PROBLEMS BUT WILL HAVE TO KEEP A CLOSE EYE ON THINGS. 
OTHERWISE...A RAINY PERIOD IS EXPECTED FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AS 
THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY LINGERS AROUND THE MOUNTAINS. MODELS INDICATE 
THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL INCREASE OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
THIS AFTERNOON...LEADING TO INCREASED LIFT AND HEAVIER RAINFALL OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. OVERALL...IT APPEARS THAT A WIDESPREAD RAINFALL 
TOTAL OF ONE TO TWO INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD GENERALLY BE A GOOD SOAKING RAIN FOR THE 
REGION. THE PROLONGED NATURE OF THIS EVENT MAY EVENTUALLY LEAD TO 
SOME MINOR FLOODING ISSUES ALONG SOME WATERWAYS AND OTHER LOW LYING 
AREAS...SO WILL CONTINUE THE FLOOD WATCH. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE SETUP FOR HEAVY RAINFALL 
WILL CONTINUE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...WITH DEEP MOISTURE 
REMAINING IN PLACE ACROSS THE REGION AND A STALLED COLD FRONT DRAPED 
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY/SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THIS...COMBINED 
WITH INCREASED UPPER-LEVEL LIFT FROM AN INTENSIFYING UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH WILL HELP TO GENERATE SEVERAL ROUNDS OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. WITH PWATS PROGGED TO BE AOA 1.2-1.5 INCHES...THESE 
SHOWERS WILL BE VERY EFFICIENT RAIN PRODUCERS WITH STORM TOTAL 
AMOUNTS APPROACHING 2-4 INCHES THROUGH WEDNESDAY IN SOME 
AREAS...PARTICULARLY ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE EAST 
TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS. THIS PROLONGED HEAVY RAINFALL COULD LEAD TO 
SIGNIFICANT RUNOFF ISSUES IN AREAS ALONG THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND 
FLOODING CONCERNS ELSEWHERE ACROSS THE AREA...ESPECIALLY IN 
URBANIZED AREAS AND LOCATIONS NEAR CREEKS/STREAMS. A FLOOD WATCH IS 
IN EFFECT THROUGH WEDNESDAY MORNING TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS POTENTIAL IN 
THE NEXT COUPLE OF DAYS. HAVE GONE CATEGORICAL POPS AREAWIDE FOR 
BOTH PERIODS...BEFORE TAPERING THEM TO CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE ON 
WEDNESDAY. 

BY LATE TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY MORNING...THE PRECIPITATION WILL 
BEGIN TO TAPER OFF A BIT FROM WEST TO EAST AS AN UPPER-WAVE SCOOTS 
ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY...PUSHING THE COLD FRONT EAST AND BRINGING 
SOME COLDER AIR INTO THE REGION. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A PROFILE 
FAVORABLE FOR FREEZING RAIN/DRIZZLE ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU IF 
TEMPERATURES WERE TO DIP BELOW FREEZING LATE TUESDAY NIGHT. 
HOWEVER...GUIDANCE IS NOT INDICATING A BLAST OF SUBFREEZING AIR TO 
MOVE THAT FAR SOUTH AND EAST...AND SO HAVE KEPT RAIN SHOWERS IN THE 
FORECAST FOR NOW...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR THE TRENDS. SOME 
LINGERING SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY /ESPECIALLY ALONG THE 
MOUNTAINS/ BEFORE THINGS BRIEFLY DRY OUT WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BOTH THE 
ECMWF AND GFS THEN BRING AN UPPER-TROUGH THROUGH THE SOUTHEASTERN US 
ON THURSDAY...BRINGING SOME ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES DURING THE DAY 
AND PERHAPS A LIGHT RAIN/WINTERY MIX THURSDAY EVENING AS THINGS 
TAPER OFF AND COLDER AIR MOVES IN WAKE OF ITS PASSAGE. THUS...HAVE 
INTRODUCED CHANCE POPS INTO THE FORECAST FOR THIS PERIOD. THEREAFTER... 
GENERALLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND DRIER WEATHER IS EXPECTED TO PREVAIL 
THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE WEEK.

309 PM EST SUN JAN 13 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...BRUNT OF CONVECTION NOT
REALLY AFFECTING OUR WRN COUNTIES YET...JUST SOME SCATTERED LIGHT
SHOWERS. DROPPED ANY MENTION OF TSRA AFTER THE LATE AFTERNOON GRIDS
PASS...AS AIRMASS IS STABLE BOTH SURFACE BASED AND ELEVATED. 

MAIN CHANGE WAS TO ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FROM NOON MONDAY THROUGH 7AM
EST WEDNESDAY...AS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO ENTER THE FORECAST AREA
AND THEN STALL. PROLONGED SW FLOW ALOFT PARALLEL TO THE FRONT AND
UNUSUALLY HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES MAY LEAD TO AT LEAST SOME
LOCALLIZED FLOODING...AS WELL AS MINOR FLOODING OF SOME OF OUR
CREEKS AND STREAMS. A CONTINGENCY RIVER FORECAST WITH 48 HOURS OF
QPF SUGGESTED A FEW RIVERS GETTING AT LEAST TO ACTION STAGE...SO
THE ADDITIONAL QPF OUT TO TUESDAY NIGHT MAY PUSH THOSE UP TO FLOOD
STAGE. 

SINCE THERE IS UNCERTAINTY AS TO EXACTLY WHERE THE FRONT STALLS...
I OPTED TO ISSUE THE FLOOD WATCH FOR ALL OF OUR TN COUNTIES AND SW
NC. THANKS TO FFC AND GSP FOR THE COORDINATION ON THE WATCH. 

OTHERWISE...DID NOT STRAY MUCH FROM PREVIOUS TEMP GRIDS...JUST A
FEW TWEAKS IN LINE WITH 12Z MOS NUMBERS. RAIN CHANCES WERE
GENERALLY NUDGED UPWARDS TO REMAIN IN LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL RANGE
FOR NEARLY ALL OF THIS PERIOD. 


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SUBTROPICAL HIGH EDGES 
VERY SLOWLY EAST TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY ALLOWING BROAD UPPER 
TROUGH TO MAKE PROGRESS INTO THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. 
THIS WILL HELP TO BRING AN END TO THE PERSISTENT RAIN OVER THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING. NEXT FEATURE 
OF INTEREST WOULD BE A SHORT WAVE TROUGH BUILDING EAST ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. ON THURSDAY. STAYED THE COURSE WITH A DRY FORECAST 
ON THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT BELIEVING THE FEATURE WILL REMAIN 
RATHER WEAK AND FAR ENOUGH SOUTH TO KEEP PRECIP OUT OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. LONG WAVE TROUGH APPEARS TO DEEPEN OVER THE EASTERN U.S. 
BRINGING COLD AIR...MORE TYPICAL OF WINTER...BACK TO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. STAYED CLOSE TO MEX MOS GUIDANCE MIN TEMPS BUT 
HAD TO TRIM A COUPLE DEGREES OFF SUGGESTED MAXES THROUGH MOST OF THE 
LONG TERM.

LOT THIS AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...LOOKS LIKE OUR WRN MOST COUNTIES HAVE 
A DECENT SHOT OF GETTING MEASURABLE RAIN BY MID TO LATE AFTERNOON... 
WHILE NE AREAS MAY STAY DRY. 

WILL UPDATE THE POP AND WEATHER GRIDS TO REFLECT A TIGHTER GRADIENT 
AND TO MESH WITH OHX AND JKL HIGHER POP GRIDS NEAR OUR PLATEAU 
COUNTIES. ALSO...ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR THOSE

RIVER FORECASTS USING 48 HOURS OF POTENTIAL RAINFALL DID NOT PRODUCE 
ANY SIGNIFICANT RISES ON AREA STREAMS. FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE 1 AND 3 
HOURLY VALUES ARE QUITE HIGH...AND THE RAIN WILL BE SPREAD OUT OVER

FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO AND LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEYS. AREA RADARS CURRENTLY REVEAL AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF 
CONVECTION ALONG THIS FRONT OVER THE LOWER OHIO AND LOWER MS RIVER 
VALLEYS. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO ONLY SLOWLY DRIFT EASTWARD 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY...AS A LARGE AND HIGHLY-AMPLIFIED

/WITH PWATS RUNNING BTWN 1.2 TO 1.5 INCHES/...ALONG WITH SOME ADDED 
SYNOPTIC LIFT FROM AN APPROACHING UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM WILL 
CREATE VERY GOOD CHANCES FOR RAINFALL MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY 
NIGHT...BEFORE THINGS SLOWLY BEGIN TO TAPER OFF ON WEDNESDAY AS THE 
BASE OF THE TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES/OHIO VALLEY. MODELS 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT... SHOWING STRONG QPF SIGNALS MOVING ACROSS 
THE AREA MONDAY MORNING AND GRADUALLY SAGGING SOUTHEAST WITH THE 
FRONT AND FAVORING THE MTNS BY MONDAY AFTERNOON. THEN MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO TUESDAY...ANOTHER ROUND OF HEAVY PRECIPITATION/TRAINING SHOWERS 
IS EXPECTED AS UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT INCREASES WITH THE APPROACHING 
UPPER-TROUGH. HAVE GONE WITH HIGH-END LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS ON 
MONDAY AND THEN CATEGORICAL POPS AREAWIDE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. 
THEREAFTER...HAVE LIKELY POPS /TO HIGH-END CHANCE POPS IN THE 
NORTHWEST ZONES/ ON TUESDAY NIGHT...BEFORE LOWERING THEM 
SIGNIFICANTLY ON WEDNESDAY AND MAINLY CONFINING THEM TO THE MOUNTAIN 
ZONES. DRY WEATHER IS THEN EXPECTED DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE 
WEEK AS A SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN AND GENERALLY ZONAL FLOW PREVAILS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SHOWERS TO OUR WEST OVER
MIDDLE TN CONTINUE TO TRACK NE AND HAVE JUST BARELY CLIPPED OUR
NWRN MOST COUNTIES ON THE NRN PLATEAU. COLD FRONT NOT YET EVEN INTO
WRN KY OR ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER INTO W TN...SO FEEL SAFE TO
CARRY JUST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS OVERNIGHT. WARM AIR HAS ALLOWED A FEW
BREAKS OF SUNSHINE...SO SOME PATCHY FOG MAY DEVELOP AGAIN TONIGHT. 
MOS GUIDANCE DEW POINT TEMPS ARE WAY OFF THE MARK GIVEN THE 19Z DEW
POINT TEMPS IN THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S. POPULATED GRIDS WITH NAM
12KM DEW POINTS UNTIL AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT. FELT
IT WAS PRUDENT TO GO SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE GFS ON MIN TEMPS...
ESPECIALLY OVER CENTRAL AND SRN AREAS (TYS/CHA).  

SUNDAY...MODELS ALL SEEM TO BE DELAYING THE SIGNIFICANT RAINS AHEAD
OF THE FRONT...SO I TRIMMED POPS BACK FOR ERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST
AREA. SLOWER TIMING SHOULD ALLOW MAX TEMPS TO REACH 60S TO LOWER
70S...BUT MY CCF HIGHS ARE IN GENERAL ABOUT 2 DEGREES BELOW RECORD
HIGHS FOR SUNDAY THE 13TH. RECORDS FOR TOMORROW ARE...CHA/TYS - 74
TRI - 72 AND OQT - 69. KEPT A MENTION OF ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FOR
WRN AREAS IN THE AFTERNOON.

SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...WE SHOULD ACTUALLY SEE SIGNIFICANT RAINS
FINALLY ARRIVE IN OUR REGION WITH THE FRONT...WHICH SHOULD SLOW OR
STALL INTO EARLY TUESDAY. HPC QPF A BIT HEAVIER THIS RUN...BUT
AFTER COORDINATION WITH NWS NEIGHBORS...FELT THAT CONDFIDENCE WAS
TOO LOW ON GETTING FLOODING RAINS AT THIS TIME. WILL UPDATE THE HWO 
PRODUCT AGAIN. A BLEND OF MOS FOR MINS AND MAXES...WITH TEMPS NOT
REALLY GOING UP MUCH AT ALL ON MONDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE ECMWF AND GFS CAME 
INTO A LITTLE BETTER AGREEMENT FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD. THE MODELS 
INDICATE A DEEP PERSISTENT SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL KEEP A CORRIDOR 
OF MOIST AIR IN PLACE ALONG A BOUNDARY SEPARATING MUCH COLDER AIR 
OVER THE MIDWEST FROM PLEASANT SPRING-LIKE WARMTH ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S. A SURFACE LOW WILL RIDE NORTHEAST ALONG THE 
BOUNDARY LATER MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY ENHANCING PRECIP. THE 
LENGTHY PERIOD OF DEEP MOISTURE AND LIFT COULD LEAD TO SOME 
EXCESSIVE RAINFALL OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THE RAIN SHOULD GRADUALLY 
TAPER OFF TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING AS THE LONG WAVE 
TROUGH FINALLY SHIFTS INTO THE EASTERN U.S. COLDER AND DRIER WEATHER 
WILL FOLLOW FROM WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SATURDAY AS A MEAN 
TROUGH HOLDS ITS POSITION OVER THE EASTERN STATES.

THE FORECAST AT CHA WHERE IFR CEILINGS MAY BREAK INTO AN MVFR DECK.
DID NOT BRING AN MVFR CEILING BACK INTO TYS UNTIL 10Z WHERE
DOWNSLOPING SHOULD KEEP FLIGHT WEATHER VFR FOR A RATHER LONG TIME.
IT IS POSSIBLE THAT THE BEST FLYING CONDITIONS WILL BE IN PLACE AT

FOR THE REST OF THE MORNING IN MANY AREAS...PROBABLY 20 PERCENT AT 
BEST...WHILE HIGHER CHANCE POPS ARE CERTAINLY JUSTIFIED ACROSS OUR 
WRN MOST COUNTIES OF EAST TN. OVERALL...CURRENT POP AND WEATHER 
GRIDS LOOK ON TRACK. MODIFIED 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS YIELDED VERY 
LITTLE INSTABILITY...SO JUST SHOWERS EXPECTED.

TEMPS STARTING OUT AROUND 15 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL HIGHS FOR MID 
JANUARY...WELL INTO THE 50S TO MID 60S ALREADY. A LOT OF CLOUD COVER 
AND MOIST LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES...BUT A SLOW RISE IN TEMPS SHOULD

LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER THE UPPER MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH 
ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWESTWARD ACROSS THE OZARKS. 
A LARGE AND HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A DEEP SOUTHWESTERLY 
WIND FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL CREATE SCATTERED SHOWERS FOR 
TODAY...WITH MORE ISOLATED COVERAGE EXPECTED FOR TONIGHT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT TODAY... 
WITH NEAR RECORD HIGHS EXPECTED AREAWIDE (CHA 71...TYS 73...OQT 
70...TRI 69). FOR TONIGHT...WILL TREND WARMER THAN BOTH SETS OF 
GUIDANCE...SINCE AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS IS IN PLACE 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH NOT MUCH COLD AIR ADVECTION EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...VERY WARM TEMPERATURES WILL 
CONTINUE FOR ONE MORE DAY ON SUNDAY AS STRONG SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT WILL PUSH HIGHS BACK INTO THE 
UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S IN MANY AREAS. HOWEVER...THE MAIN WEATHER 
STORY EARLY THIS UPCOMING WEEK WILL BE THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY 
RAINFALL AREAWIDE AS THE AFOREMENTIONED FRONT MOVES INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SUNDAY AFTERNOON/ EVENING AND STALLS OUT 
ACROSS THE REGION MONDAY INTO TUESDAY... BEFORE EXITING THE AREA BY 
WEDNESDAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THIS 
FRONT/PRECIP AND SHOW SOME STRONG QPF SIGNALS MOVING INTO THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU MID/LATE AFTERNOON ON SUNDAY AND OVERSPREADING 
THE AREA OVERNIGHT AND INTO THE DAY ON MONDAY. THEN...ADDITIONAL 
ROUNDS OF HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE POSSIBLE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
AS SOME UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT FROM AN ADVANCING UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
COMBINES WITH THE STALLED BOUNDARY AND DEEP MOISTURE IN PLACE ACROSS 
THE AREA. WITH THE BASE OF THE TROUGH SWINGING THROUGH THE OHIO 
VALLEY AND MIDDLE/EAST TENNESSEE LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY...POPS WILL THEN BEGIN TO TAPER OFF FROM WEST TO 
EAST...WITH A DRY FORECAST EXPECTED BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE 
REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PERIOD.  

GIVEN THE FACTORS MENTIONED ABOVE...THINK THAT THE PROSPECTS FOR 
HEAVY RAINFALL OF BETWEEN 2-3 INCHES WILL BE COMMON ACROSS MOST OF 
THE FORECAST AREA FROM SUNDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE INDICATING PWAT VALUES TO BE BTWN 1 TO 
1.5 INCHES SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY WHEN THE HEAVIEST RAINFALL 
POTENTIAL IS EXPECTED...WHICH ARE ABNORMALLY HIGH FOR MID JANUARY. 
HAVE RAISED POPS TO CATEGORICAL SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY NIGHT...WITH 
HIGH-END LIKELY POPS FOR THE DAYTIME HOURS MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THEN 
BEGIN TAPERING THEM OFF TO CHANCE POPS TUESDAY NIGHT. ALSO...HAVE 
INCLUDED THE POTENTIAL FOR MIXED PHASE PRECIPITATION LATE TUESDAY 
NIGHT ALONG THE PLATEAU AS A SHOT OF COLDER AIR MOVES BEHIND THIS 
STORM SYSTEM...ALLOWING FOR SOME SNOW TO MIX IN WITH THE RAIN.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHOWERS WERE NOT VERY
IMPRESSIVE THIS AFTERNOON...BUT CLOUDS GENERALLY KEPT TEMPS BELOW
RECORD HIGHS. SCATTERED SHOWERS CONTINUE TO OUR SOUTH AND MODELS
TRY TO BRING A FEW SHOWERS NORTH OVERNIGHT. I RAN 30 TO 40 PERCENT
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE SRN THIRD OVERNIGHT...TO MOSTLY SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS FOR NE TN/SW VA. PARTIAL CLEARING MAY SET THE STAGE FOR
AT LEAST PATCHY AREAS OF FOG. WENT ABOUT 1 TO 3 DEGS ABOVE GFS MOS
ON MINS WHICH FITS THE PATTERN OF LATE IN THIS VERY MILD AIRMASS.

FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT...MODELS SEEM TO HAVE TRENDED A
LITTLE WETTER FOR SATURDAY BUT I AM NOT READY TO BUY INTO THIS
SCENARIO JUST YET. WE STAY IN THE MOIST AIRMASS BUT THE NEXT COLD
FRONT IS QUITE FAR TO OUR WEST...SO I AM WONDERING WHERE ANY
ORGANIZED LIFT WILL COME FROM. THUS...I FAVORED JUST SLIGHT TO LOW
CHANCE POPS FOR NOW ON SATURDAY...AND ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
SATURDAY NIGHT. RECORD HIGH TEMPS ARE IN JEOPARDY AS ALREADY
ADVERTISED. 

FOR SUNDAY...COLD FRONT APPROACHES AND EXPECT AT LEAST WESTERN
2/3RDS OF THE FORECAST AREA TO GET SOME SHOWERS BY SUNDAY
AFTERNOON. AIRMASS BECOMES SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE ON MAINLY THE PLATEAU 
SO I ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR WRN MOST AREAS
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. NO REASON TO DIFFER MUCH FROM SIMILAR MOS MAX
TEMPS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE TO 
CONVERGE ON WEATHER SCENARIO IN THE EARLY PORTION OF THE FORECAST 
BUT WANDER INTO SLIGHTLY DIFFERING SOLUTIONS...DIFFERENT 
TIMING...DURING THE LATTER HALF OF THE EXTENDED. BASICALLY STAYED 
THE COURSE EARLY WHILE EDGING POPS HIGHER INTO THE CATEGORICAL RANGE 
WITH SOME LIKELY PROBABILITIES ALONG WITH HEAVY RAINFALL SUNDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. MODELS HAVE CONVERGED ON THE GFS IDEA FROM 
THURSDAY'S MODEL RUN WHICH SHOWED INCLEMENT WEATHER SHIFTING EAST AT 
A LITTLE QUICKER PACE. THEREFORE STARTED TO DROP POPS BACK FROM 
LIKELY CATEGORY MONDAY NIGHT INTO MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE FOR SHOWERS 
BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON AS THE DEEP UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS INTO THE 
EASTERN U.S. ONLY HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER EASTERN SECTIONS 
BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. FOR THIS PART OF THE FORECAST (TUESDAY NIGHT 
INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING) EDGED THE DEPARTURE OF THE RAIN CLOSER TO 
THE SLIGHTLY SLOWER ECMWF DEPICTION. KEPT A DRY FORECAST GOING 
WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY TRENDING A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE GFS BUT 
CONFIDENCE IS NOT TERRIBLY HIGH WITH A DEEPENING EASTERN U.S. TROUGH 
HINTING AT THE POSSIBILITY OF BRINGING A LIGHT NORTHWEST SNOWFALL 
EVENT TO THE REGION SOMETIME WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY WHILE A 
SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE RIPS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER PRODUCING MORE 
LIGHT PRECIPITATION LATER THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY.

345 AM EST FRI JAN 11 2013

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE MISSOURI/IOWA BORDER...WITH 
ITS ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE WESTERN 
TN RIVER VALLEY INTO NORTHERN AL...AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT 
EXTENDING SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE MS RIVER VALLEY. AREA RADARS REVEAL A 
FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WHICH WILL 
LIKELY EXPAND IN COVERAGE AS THE WARM FRONT MOVES NORTHEASTWARD INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA AFTER SUNRISE AND AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE MOVES 
ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. THE WEAK COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO 
MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATER THIS AFTERNOON...AND THEN STALL 
OUT SOMEWHERE AROUND THE MOUNTAINS TONIGHT. AS A RESULT...SCATTERED 
SHOWERS WILL CONTINUE TO BE POSSIBLE TONIGHT...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS 
OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WHERE DEEPER MOISTURE 
RESIDES. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER 
NAM NUMBERS SINCE AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS IS ALREADY 
IN PLACE OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...NEAR RECORD WARM CONDITIONS 
ARE EXPECTED ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS WEEKEND...AS A STOUT 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL RAMP UP AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING STORM- 
SYSTEM/COLD FRONT TO THE WEST AND A LARGE SPRAWLING SUBTROPICAL HIGH 
TO THE SOUTHEAST. WITH SUCH STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION...HIGH 
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED TO CLIMB WELL INTO THE MID/UPPER 60S TO 
PERHAPS THE LOWER 70S ON SATURDAY AT TYS/CHA. THESE READINGS WOULD 
TIE OR SET RECORD HIGHS FOR THAT DATE. THE CLOUD COVER AND POTENTIAL 
FOR SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS MAY KEEP TEMPS COOLER ON SUNDAY...BUT 
THEY ARE STILL EXPECTED TO REACH THE MID TO UPPER 60S AREAWIDE.

A COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO PUSH INTO THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY 
EVENING/NIGHT AND STALL OUT ACROSS THE REGION EARLY NEXT WEEK.THIS 
FRONT WILL BRING COOLER TEMPERATURES AND SOME VERY GOOD CHANCES FOR 
PRECIPITATION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND TUESDAY...BEFORE THINGS 
BEGIN TO TAPER OFF BY WEDNESDAY. GIVEN THE DEEP MOISTURE THAT WILL 
BE IN PLACE OVER THE AREA...A STALLED/SLOW MOVING FRONT AND SOME 
UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT FROM A SLOW MOVING UPPER-TROUGH OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY...THE POTENTIAL FOR VERY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL EXIST OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS WEEK /ESPECIALLY DURING A MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY TIMEFRAME/. HPC STORM TOTAL RAINFALL AMOUNTS THROUGH 12Z 
WEDNESDAY ADD UP TO AROUND 2-3 INCHES OVER A BULK OF THE REGION. AS 
A RESULT...HAVE INCREASED POPS SLIGHTLY DURING THE SUNDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY TIME FRAME TO REFLECT THIS THINKING. HAVE LIKELY 
POPS STARTING LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS MONDAY 
AND MONDAY NIGHT AND LIKELY POPS AGAIN FOR TUESDAY. THEN GRADUALLY 
TAPER THINGS OFF FROM WEST TO EAST BEGINNING TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE 
FRONT GRADUALLY SLIPS OUT OF THE AREA /BUT STILL HAVE CHANCE TO 
LIKELY POPS THROUGH 12Z WEDNESDAY/. THERE IS SOME DISCREPANCY IN THE 
MODELS LATE IN THE PERIOD...WITH THE GFS SHOWING ZONAL FLOW AND 
DRIER WEATHER...AND THE ECMWF INDICATING A PASSING SHORTWAVE AND 
ADDITIONAL RAIN CHANCES. FOR NOW...GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY HAVE KEPT 
THE FORECAST DRY AND WILL WAIT ON ANOTHER MODEL RUN OR TWO BEFORE 
MAKING ANY CHANGES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...NOT MUCH IN THE WAY OF
SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON...GIVEN THE GULF COAST CONVECTION TO OUR SOUTH
PLUS SOME WEAK DOWNSLOPE FLOW INTO THE CENTRAL AND NRN VALLEY 
COUNTIES. A FEW AREAS OF SUNSHINE WERE NOTED WITH TEMPS RISING INTO
THE MID TO UPPER 60S IN THOSE SPOTS. 

TONIGHT...THE CLOSED UPPER LOW THAT WAS OVER SRN TX IS NOW ON THE
MOVE NE THROUGH OK...AND WILL SEND MORE SHOWERS OUR WAY BY THE 06Z
TO 12Z PERIOD ON FRIDAY. GOOD AGREEMENT BETWEEN SHORT RANGE MODELS
AND SREF FOR THESE SHOWERS SWEEPING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON
FRIDAY...WITH A DECREASE IN POPS FROM THE WEST BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON.
MINS TONIGHT SHOULD BE QUITE MILD...ACTUALLY AT OR A FEW DEGREES
ABOVE SEASONAL HIGHS FOR THIS TIME OF THE YEAR. WITH THE SHOWERS ON
THE DECLINE BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...I FELT AT LEAST A MOS BLEND WAS
REACHABLE FOR MAX TEMPS. APPEARS THESE HIGHS OVERALL WILL BE BELOW
RECORD HIGHS...SO NO MENTION IN THE ZFP PRODUCT. 

FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...BRUNT OF DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT IS
WELL TO OUR WEST FOR THESE PERIODS...SO KEPT JUST MINIMAL POPS IN
FOR NOW IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS. THOSE RECORD HIGHS MAY BE IN
JEOPARDY ON SATURDAY...SO ADDED RECORD HIGH WORDING. 

RECORD HIGHS FOR FRIDAY (1/11/13)...CHA - 78...TYS - 71...TRI - 64.
RECORD HIGHS FOR SATURDAY (1/12)....CHA - 70...TYS - 71...TRI - 69.

MOS MINS CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED EACH NIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS HAVE
TRENDED A LITTLE CLOSER IN DEPICTION OF EXPECTED WEATHER THROUGH
12Z WEDNESDAY. TRENDED POPS BACK A FAIR AMOUNT SATURDAY NIGHT INTO
THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY SUNDAY AS MODEL FORECASTS APPEAR TO BE IN
AGREEMENT MAIN AXIS OF DEEP MOISTURE AND LIFT SITUATED ALONG THE
SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY POSITIONED OVER THE WEST TENNESSEE.
DOWNSLOPING FLOW ACROSS THE TERRAIN MAY EVEN KEEP A GOOD PART OF
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE DRY UNTIL SUNDAY
AFTERNOON THE FRONT MAKES SLOW PROGRESS TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS.
THE BOUNDARY STILL LOOKS LIKE IT MAY STALL OR MAKE EXTREMELY SLOW
PROGRESS ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS MONDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. THEREFORE
KEPT LIKELY POPS GOING DURING THIS PERIOD AS NUMEROUS SHOWERS FORM
IN THE MOIST ENVIRONMENT WITH THE HELP OF SEVERAL WAVES OF LOW
PRESSURE RIDING ALONG THE BOUNDARY. WILL HAVE TO WATCH FOR
EXCESSIVE RAINFALL MONDAY AND TUESDAY WITH THE STALLED BOUNDARY
AIDING AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF LIFT. TRENDED POPS BACK DURING THE DAY
WEDNESDAY AS THE FRONT FINALLY SLIPS ACROSS THE TERRAIN MAKING ITS
WAY ACROSS THE EASTERN SEABOARD. STAYED CLOSER TO THE GFS FOR THE
PERIOD WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WHICH MOVES THE INCLEMENT WEATHER
EAST WITHOUT THREATENING THE ARRIVAL OF ANOTHER STRONG SOUTHERN
STREAM SHORT WAVE WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE SOUTHEASTERN U.S.
RAINFALL. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE ALTHOUGH
UNDERCUT THE PROJECTED LOWER 70 DEGREE HIGHS ON SUNDAY WITH THICKER

.AVIATION...HEALTHY SHORT WAVE/UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER THE PLAINS WILL
GET A KICK TO THE NORTHEAST DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD ENDING UP
OVER THE EASTERN LAKES AROUND 18Z FRIDAY. STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW IS
MOISTENING THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WITH RATHER LOW CEILINGS. MOST OF
THE RAIN ACROSS THE MID SOUTH IS ORIENTED ALONG A WARM FRONTAL
BOUNDARY PRESSING NORTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. ALTHOUGH THERE ARE
A FEW SMALL AREAS OF LIGHT SHOWERS OVER NORTHERN SECTIONS OF
ALABAMA AND GEORGIA AND A COUPLE OF THESE MAY MOVE ACROSS CHA THIS
AFTERNOON SO KEPT MVFR VSBY IN PLACE HERE FOR THIS POSSIBILITY. THE
LOW LEVELS ARE SO MOIST IN THIS AREA THAT CHA MAY EVEN FLIRT WITH
AN IFR CEILING IF A SHOWER OR TWO BUILD OVER THE TERMINAL. THOUGHT
THE CEILINGS MAY IMPROVE A BIT LATER THIS AFTERNOON INTO THE EARLY
EVENING HOURS SO INDICATED SOME SLIGHT BETTER ALBEIT MVFR WEATHER
HERE. TYPICALLY WITH A STRONG SOUTHERLY FLOW IN THIS SCENARIO A
DOWNSLOPING FLOW CROSSING THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER SHOULD ALLOW
FOR MUCH BETTER FLIGHT CONDITIONS AT TYS AND TRI WITH THE BEST OF
THESE TERMINALS OCCURRING AT TRI. TYS MAY DROP INTO MVFR RANGE
LATER TONIGHT AS A COUPLE LIGHT SHOWERS BUILD THROUGH THE VALLEY
BUT TRI MAY NOT BECOME MVFR UNTIL MID MORNING FRIDAY WHEN THE MAIN
BODY OF THE PLAINS TROUGH BUILDS NORTHEAST TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES.

.DISCUSSION...STARTING OUT GENERALLY DRY ACROSS THE REGION THIS 
MORNING IN SPITE OF A VERY MOIST AIRMASS FROM MIDDLE TN EASTWARD 
INTO MAINLY THE SW HALF OF EAST TN.  THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING HAD 
PRECIPITABLE WATER (PW) VALUE OF JUST OVER 1.35 INCHES (300 PERCENT 
OF NORMAL). 12Z RNK SOUNDING MUCH DRIER WITH LESS THAN 1/2 INCH PW.
12Z UPPER PLOTS SHOW A LIGHT SOUTHERLY FLOW AT 850 MB LEVEL...SO A 
BIT OF DOWNSLOPING IS LIKELY AFFECTING PARTS OF NE TN AND SW VA. 
ANOTHER FACTOR FOR LACK OF RAIN THIS MORNING IN OUR AREA MAY BE THE 
STRONG CONVECTION ALREADY OCCURRING OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY REGION.

LATEST RUC MODEL RUN AND SREF ARE ONLY SHOWING SOME SCATTERED AREAS 
OF RAIN DEVELOPING OVER OUR WRN MOST COUNTIES LATER TODAY. THUS...
PLAN TO DO A MID MORNING UPDATE TO LOWER RAIN CHANCES. 

MAX TEMP FORECAST IS PROBABLY ON TRACK...ALTHO WARM FRONT IS STILL 
TO OUR SOUTH. 14Z TEMPS WERE VERY MILD AND ALREADY ABOVE SEASONAL 
HIGHS FOR MID JANUARY...SO ANY BREAKS OF SUNSHINE OR DOWNSLOPING 
SHOULD SEND HIGHS INTO THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WAS CENTERED OVER
THE OHIO VALLEY WITH LOW PRESSURE OVER TEXAS WITH A FRONTAL
BOUNDARY OVER THE SOUTHERN STATES. WARM MOIST AIR MASS WAS
OVERRUNNING THE FRONT AND KEEPING LOW CLOUDS AND FOG ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. PATCHY DENSE FOG HAD VISIBILITIES AT
AROUND ONE HALF MILE IN A FEW SPOTS EARLY THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES
HAVE BEEN NEARLY STEADY TO SLOWLY RISING WITH SOME SPRINKLES OR
DRIZZLE ACROSS WESTERN SECTIONS. MODELS BRING THIS BOUNDARY NORTH
AS A WARM FRONT THIS AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT. THE FRONT WILL REACH
THE NE SECTIONS BY LATE TONIGHT. LIGHT WINDS THIS MORNING WILL
INCREASE LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT OUT OF THE SOUTHEAST AND WILL BE
GUSTY OVER THE PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT
TIGHTENS BETWEEN THE HIGH PRESSURE AREA ALONG THE EAST COAST AND
LOWER PRESSURE OVER THE MS VALLEY. PATCHY LIGHT RAIN WILL BE MORE
LIKELY WEST TODAY AND LATE TONIGHT BUT AMOUNTS WILL STILL BE LIGHT.
HIGHS TODAY SHOULD REACH THE 60S LOWER ELEVATIONS AND 50S MOUNTAINS
WITH LOWS TONIGHT STILL MILD IN THE MID 40S TO MID 50S.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...VERY WARM AND WET
CONDITIONS ON TRACK. QUESTIONS REMAIN WITH EARLY PRECIPITATION
TIMING AND SURFACE FRONTAL POSITION LATE.

SHORTWAVE WILL SWING THROUGH MIDDLE TN AND W KY EARLY FRIDAY. THIS 
WILL MOVE SURFACE WARM FRONT NORTH THROUGH THE E TN VALLEY AND THE 
SOUTHERN APPS. GOOD CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ALONG FRONT AND TEMPS 
CONTINUE TO RISE. CONDITIONS DRY OUT SOME FRI NIGHT THROUGH SAT 
NIGHT AS MAIN FOCUS OF WEATHER WILL BE ALONG COLD FRONT EXTENDING 
FROM E TX THROUGH MID MS VLY TO THE S GREAT LKS. THIS FEATURE WILL 
HAVE PARALLEL FLOW ALOFT RESULTING IN WIDESPREAD RAINFALL. 
LOCALLY...TEMPERATURES REMAIN WELL ABOVE NORMAL. LONG FETCH UPPER 
SWRLY FLOW AND DEEP LAYER MOISTURE WILL SLOWLY SHIFT EAST OVER THE 
WEEKEND. WIDESPREAD PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE EASTWARD INTO THE E TN 
VALLEY ON SUNDAY. PWAT VALUES REMAIN VERY HIGH FOR THE EARLY WINTER 
SEASON. PROTRACTED RAINFALL EXPECTED AS UPPER SWRLY FLOW REMAINS 
OVER W TN. THERE IS SOME QUESTION ABOUT SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
EXTENDING SE OF THE S APPS EARLY NEXT WEEK. SE RIDGE HAS BEEN 
STUBBORN TO RETREAT THIS SEASON SO EXPECT FRONT TO REMAIN ALONG E 
MRX CWA FOR MUCH OF EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS APPEARS TOO AGGRESSIVE WILL 
BUILDING IN SURFACE RIDGE AND DRIER AIR MASS BY TUE. STAYED WITH 
WARMER AND WETTER SOLUTION FOR NOW AT BACK END OF FORECAST. 

ONCE AGAIN--THE TIME FRAME OF SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WILL NEED TO BE 
WATCHED CLOSELY FOR HEAVY RAINFALL/FLOODING POTENTIAL. ALONG WITH 
THE NEAR OR ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES 
WILL BE PEGGING MAX VALUES FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...AND MOISTURE 
TRANSPORT ACROSS THE AREA WHEN THE MAIN RAIN AXIS WOULD BE OVER US 
WILL BE VERY STRONG.

THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER NRN MEXICO/SRN TX WILL QUICKLY SEND 
ANOTHER VORTICITY LOBE AND MORE SHOWERS OUR WAY AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
SPLIT THE WEATHER AND POP GRIDS IN HALF FOR TONIGHT...WITH LIKELY

SOME DOWNSLOPING FOR NE TN AND PARTS OF SW VA THURSDAY...SO I STAYED 
CLOSE TO THE MOS BLEND OF MAINLY CHANCE POPS THERE.

OTHERWISE...TEMPS HAVE STRUGGLED TO CLIMG MUCH TODAY...BUT WILL STAY 
VERY MILD FOR TONIGHT...SO WENT A COUPLE OF DEGREES ABOVE THE COOLER

VORTICITY AND SATURATED AIR MASS QUICKLY EXIT OUR AREA AS THE WAVE
BECOMES INCREASINGLY NEGATIVELY TILTED AND CONTINUES TO MOVE
NORTHEAST DURING THE DAY ON FRIDAY. THIS WILL LEAD TO A DECREASE IN
POPS THROUGHOUT THE DAY AND A DRIER AIR MASS THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT.
SURFACE RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD BACK IN AS WAVE EXITS. MOISTURE WILL
BEGIN TO RETURN ON SATURDAY BUT FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR
PRECIPITATION IS LACKING. NAM SEEMS TO HAVE A BETTER HANDLE ON LACK
OF LIFT WHILE GFS SEEMS TO HAVE A WETTER SOLUTION. CURRENT THINKING
IS TO TREND TOWARD THE NAM FOR SATURDAY MORNING AND ONLY KEEP A
SLIGHT CHANCE OF POPS. INCREASING POPS FROM WEST TO EAST ON
SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING AS A SIGNIFICANT FRONTAL BOUNDARY
ESTABLISHES FROM E TX NE THROUGH THE MS/W TN AND W OH VALLEY AND
BEGINS TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST TOWARD OUR AREA.

.LONG TERM 2 (SUNDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...DURING THIS PERIOD A
HEAVY RAIN EVENT IS EXPECTED TO OCCUR SOMEWHERE IN TENNESSEE--THE
EAST-WEST SETUP DETAILS WILL BE AN IMPORTANT ISSUE. RIGHT NOW THERE
IS MODERATE AGREEMENT FOR THE PRIME RAIN AXIS TO BE WEST OF OUR
AREA ON SUNDAY...GETTING CLOSER AND POSSIBLY OVER THE AREA
MONDAY...THEN OVER THE AREA ON TUESDAY AS THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
HANGS UP IN THE AREA. FOR WEDNESDAY...THERE IS ALSO AGREEMENT THAT
THIS SYSTEM WILL BE MOVING OUT OF THE AREA...WHILE THE NEXT UPPER
LOW IS STALLED IN THE DESERT SW. FOR PRECIP CHANCES HAVE SETTLED
WITH THE ECMWF PATTERN OF A STEADILY SETTLING OF THE PRECIP INTO
THE AREA...RATHER THAN THE GFS PATTERN OF PUSHING PRECIP
THROUGH...THEN BUILDING IT UP AGAIN. THIS RESULTS IN HIGHER POPS IN
OUR WESTERN AREAS SLOWLY SPREADING EASTWARD SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY
NIGHT...THEN BY TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT HAVING HIGH POPS ACROSS
THE WHOLE AREA...AND ONCE AGAIN STARTING TO EXIT ON WEDNESDAY.

AT THE SURFACE...A COLD FRONT WILL BE MOVING IN WITH THIS SYSTEM.  
TIMING OF THE FRONT IS QUESTIONABLE...BUT WITH THE FRONT SHALLOW AND 
THE MOISTURE HIGH...THE EXACT LOCATION OF ANY PARTICULAR SITE WILL 
NOT BE SIGNIFICANTLY DIFFERENT WITH RESPECT TO MAX/MIN TEMPS.  THE 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY PLACEMENT WILL BE MORE SIGNIFICANT ON THE MECHANISM 
FOR FOCUSING THE HEAVIEST RAINS.  BOTH GFS AND KEEP THE FRONT IN THE 
AREA UNTIL ABOUT WEDNESDAY...WHEN THEY PUSH IT EASTWARD.

TEMPERATURES WILL BE MUCH ABOVE NORMAL ON SUNDAY...WITH RECORDS 
THREATENED.  AM KEEPING FRONT SLOW TO MAKE IT THROUGH THE AREA...SO 
WENT ON THE HIGH SIDE OF GUIDANCE MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY...ESPECIALLY ON MIN TEMPS.

ONCE AGAIN--THE TIMEFRAME OF SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WILL NEED TO BE
WATCHED CLOSELY FOR HEAVY RAINFALL/FLOODING POTENTIAL. ALONG WITH
THE NEAR OR ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES...PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES
WILL BE PEGGING MAX VALUES FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR...AND MOISTURE
TRANSPORT ACROSS THE AREA WHEN THE MAIN RAIN AXIS WOULD BE OVER US
WILL BE VERY STRONG.

.SHORT TERM...
SOME PASSING MID TO HIGH CLOUDS AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING STORM
SYSTEM OVER TEXAS IS THE ONLY WEATHER TO SPEAK OFF AS MOSTLY SUNNY
CONDITIONS ARE PREVAILING ACROSS MUCH OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES ARE ONCE AGAIN
MILD /AND WITH THE AMPLE SUNSHINE AND VEERED SE/SSE WINDS/ HAVE
RISEN INTO THE LOW TO MID 50S AREAWIDE. OVERNIGHT HOWEVER...LOW
CLOUDS WILL BECOME DENSER AS LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE INCREASES AHEAD OF
THE AFOREMENTIONED STORM SYSTEM. SOME AREAS OF REDUCED VIS FROM
LIGHT FOG WILL ALSO BE POSSIBLE...BUT DO NOT THINK IT WILL BE DENSE
OR WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO WARRANT A MENTION IN THE ZONES ATTM. 

BY EARLY TMRW MORNING...ALL MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE THE
POTENTIAL FOR SOME SCATTERED LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS MOVING INTO THE
REGION FROM THE SOUTHWEST. THEREFORE...HAVE INCREASED POPS
SLIGHTLY TO CHANCE FOR LOCATIONS GENERALLY SOUTH AND WEST OF
MORRISTOWN...AND HAVE GONE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SOUTHWEST VA/
NORTHEAST TN BY THE LATE AFTERNOON. THE BEST CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL
BE FOR THOSE LOCATIONS ACROSS SE TENNESSEE/SW NORTH CAROLINA. WITH
SOUTHERLY WINDS...A MILDER NIGHT CAN BE EXPECTED...FOLLOWED BY
ANOTHER UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY. HAVE UNDERCUT HIGHS BY A FEW DEGREES
FROM MOS GIVEN THE EXPECTED RAIN/CLOUD COVER...BUT READINGS IN THE
MID TO UPPER 50S AREAWIDE ARE EXPECTED BY THE AFTERNOON AGAIN.

.LONG TERM /WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY/...  
DEEP MOISTURE WILL REMAIN OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND
THURSDAY...ALTHOUGH LIFT WILL BE WEAK BOTH PERIODS. LIGHT PRECIP
WILL COME FROM A DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW AND ISENTROPIC LIFT...WITH THE
BEST CHANCES SOUTH. ENSEMLE POP SPREAD IS VERY LARGE THESE PERIODS
DUE TO THE WEAK FORCING...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW. POPS WILL STAY IN
THE CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE. SYNOPTIC FORCING WILL INCREASE
THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE LOW TRACKS INTO MISSOURI. THE 850 MB JET
PICKS UP TO 40-50 KTS...AND UPPER DIVERGENCE INCREASES AHEAD OF A
NEGATIVELY-TILTED UPPER TROUGH. POPS WILL RISE ACCORDINGLY INTO THE
LIKELY RANGE...ALONG WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS IN
SOUTHERN AREAS. THE SYSTEM EXITS FRIDAY...WITH DECREASING POPS
THROUGH THE DAY. HOWEVER TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN QUITE WARM INTO
SATURDAY AS A DEEP SW FLOW CONTINUES ON THE WEST SIDE OF A STRONG
EAST COAST RIDGE.

AN UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN REMAINS THROUGH THE END OF THE 
EXTENDED...WITH A LONGWAVE TROUGH SITTING OVER THE ROCKIES AND 
PLAINS. MODEL AGREEMENT IS GOOD WITH RELATIVELY LOW ENSEMBLE 
SPREAD...AND SOME SLIGHT TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND 
THE GFS. WITH HIGH PRESSURE REMAINING IN PLACE TO OUR 
SOUTHEAST...THIS SYSTEM WILL HAVE PLENTY OF GULF MOISTURE 
AVAILABLE...AND A BOUNDARY RUNNING PARALLEL TO THE UPPER FLOW WILL 
BE NEARLY STATIONARY ACROSS THE MS/OH VALLEY REGIONS. SLOW 
PROPAGATION OF THE SYSTEM WILL KEEP A HIGH CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS 
OUR AREA FROM SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THE END OF THE FORECAST.

PREVAILING THIS AFTERNOON PUSHING HIGHS BACK INTO THE UPPER 40S TO
LOWER 50S IN MOST LOCATIONS. FOR TONIGHT...THE CLEAR...CALM AND DRY
CONDITIONS WILL PROMOTE GOOD RADITIONAL COOLING TONIGHT AS
TEMPERATURES WILL FALL PRETTY QUICKLY AFTER SUNSET AND DIP BELOW
FREEZING IN THE MID 20S TO LOWER 30S IN MOST AREAS. FOR
TOMORROW...SOME MID TO UPPER-LEVEL MOISTURE WILL SLOWLY BEGIN TO
INCREASE AS WINDS VEER TO A SOUTHERLY DIRECTION AHEAD OF A STORM
SYSTEM IN TEXAS...RESULTING IN SOME HIGH CLOUDS SPREADING INTO THE
FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY TMRW. HOWEVER...GIVEN THE ABOUNDANT
SUNSHINE AND INCREASED THICKNESS/TEMPS ALOFT...HIGHS WILL BE 5-10
DEGREES WARMER BY THE LATE AFTERNOON...REACHING THE MID TO UPPER
50S ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM /TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY/...
WARM ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE AREA
ON WEDNESDAY AS A RIDGE SITS OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST AND A CLOSED
LOW TRACKS INTO TX. AS THE LOW TRACKS TOWARD THE NORTHEAST...THE
SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL STRENGTHEN AND BRING DEEPER MOISTURE TO THE
AREA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. HOWEVER LIFT REMAINS WEAK AS
THE MIDLEVEL CIRCULATION STAYS WEST OF THE MS RIVER. BETTER UPPER
DIVERGENCE AND A 50 KT LLJ DEVELOP THURSDAY NIGHT...WHICH APPEARS
TO BE THE PERIOD OF THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES...ALONG WITH A SLIGHT
CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. ENSEMBLE SPREAD IS QUITE HIGH WITH THIS
SYSTEM...SO OVERALL CONFIDENCE IS LOW...THUS WILL KEEP POPS WITHIN
THE CHANCE RANGE. PRECIP CHANCES WILL DECREASE FRIDAY AS THE LOW
TRACKS INTO CANADA...BUT TEMPS WILL REMAIN MILD AS THE FLOW ALOFT
REMAINS FROM THE SW.

STRONG RIDGING WILL QUICKLY BUILD IN ACROSS OUR REGION AFTER THE 
PASSAGE OF THE WARM FRONT FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL CAUSE AN 
UNSEASONABLE WARMING TREND...ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO RISE INTO THE 
60S TO NEAR 70 FOR THE WEEKEND. MODELS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH 
SHOWING THE NEXT FRONT TO MOVE IN AND SPREAD ANOTHER ROUND OF 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL 
DROP WITH THE FRONTAL PASSAGE ON MONDAY BUT SHOULD REMAIN WELL ABOVE 
NORMAL.

VERY MINOR CHANGES MADE TO THE FORECAST THIS MORNING AS EVERYTHING

SUNNY TO MOSTLY SKY AREAWIDE TODAY /AS ANY LINGERING STRATOCUMULUS
CLOUDS HAVE MOVED NORTHEAST OF OUR SW VIRGINIA COUNTIES/. A
NORTHEASTERLY FLOW WILL HELP TO KEEP TEMPERATURES CHILLY EARLY
ON...SO HAVE UNDERCUT THE LATEST GUIDANCE BY A DEGREE OR TWO.
HOWEVER...AMPLE SUNSHINE AND VEERING WINDS TO THE SOUTHEAST SHOULD
WARM HIGHS INTO THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S IN MOST AREAS BY THE END

THROUGH THIS EVENING AS A SHORT WAVE BRUSHES THE AREA.  JUST A BRIEF 
SHOT OF COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE FRONT BEFORE WARMING BEGINS.  WILL 
JUST CONTINUE THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NORTHERN AND CENTRAL 
MOUNTAIN AREAS EARLY TONIGHT.  SHOULD SEE CLEARING FROM SOUTHWEST TO 
NORTHEAST TONIGHT...THEN PLENTY OF SUNSHINE MONDAY. NO MAJOR
ARGUMENTS WITH MAV TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)... AN UPPER-RIDGE AXIS
OVER THE BAHAMAS WILL GRADUALLY STRENGTHEN AND BUILD NORTHWESTWARD
INTO THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THIS WEEK... PROMOTING DRY/CLEAR AND
WARMER CONDITIONS FOR TUESDAY AS HIGHS RETURN TO THE 50S AREAWIDE.
HOWEVER...A DEEPENING UPPER-LEVEL LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER TEXAS
WILL GRADUALLY PUSH TOWARD THE LOWER-MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND
EVENTUALLY THE OHIO VALLEY...BRINGING A GOOD CHANCE FOR
PRECIPITATION HEADING INTO THE LATTER HALF OF THE WORK WEEK. BY
WEDNESDAY...MOISTURE WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE ACROSS THE REGION AS A
SOUTHERLY FLOW RAMPS UP AHEAD OF THIS STORM SYSTEM. SOME LIGHT
PRECIPITATION MAY BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN ZONES ON
WEDNESDAY...BUT BETTER CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL BEGIN WEDNESDAY
NIGHT...AND ESPECIALLY THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT AS DEEP MOISTURE
MOVES OVER THE FORECAST AREA...COMBINED WITH THE ENHANCED LIFT FROM
THE APPROACHING STORM SYSTEM. SOME DECENT CHANCES FOR RAIN WILL
EXIST ON FRIDAY...BEFORE THINGS TAPER OFF BY FRIDAY EVENING/NIGHT.
A BREAK IN THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE SHORT-LIVED IT APPEARS AS
THOUGH ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM WILL MOVE INTO THE MID-SOUTH/OHIO
VALLEY BY THE WEEKEND.

GIVEN THE FACT THAT THE GFS/ECMWF HAVE BEGUN TO FINALLY COME IN LINE 
WITH TIMING...HAVE INCREASED POPS TO HIGH-END CHANCE TO LIKELY ON 
THURSDAY...AND HAVE GONE LIKELY AREAWIDE THURSDAY NIGHT...WITH 
HIGH-END CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY AS WELL. ADDITIONALLY...GIVEN THE 
STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION EXPECTED AHEAD OF THIS STORM SYSTEM...HAVE 
BUMPED TEMPS UP WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND AS WELL...THOUGH HAVE

.AVIATION...RELATIVELY WEAK SHORT WAVE NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH
PASSES QUICKLY NORTHEAST FROM THE MIDWEST INTO THE NORTHEASTERN
U.S. TONIGHT. THE SYSTEM IS BEING FED BY A HEALTHY AMOUNT OF
MOISTURE AROUND 800 TO 500 MILLIBARS WITH SOUTHERN STREAM JET IN
PLACE ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. THE PROBLEM IS LACK OF LOW LEVEL INFLOW
OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO. SOME LIGHT RAIN ONGOING ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY OF ALABAMA IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE WAVE WILL BUILD
ACROSS THE GREAT VALLEY TONIGHT AND WOULD EXPECT A FEW DROPS OF
RAIN AS THE LOW LEVEL MOISTEN BUT PROBABLY NOT MUCH MORE THAN THAT.
KEPT FLIGHT WEATHER VFR FOR THE MOST PART WITH CEILINGS GENERALLY
NOT DROPPING MUCH BELOW 3500 FEET. HOWEVER...THERE IS A CHANCE THAT
A LOWER CEILING MAY DEVELOP...MAINLY AROUND CHA LATER TONIGHT. KEPT
A BKN-OVC LAYER GOING AROUND 3500 FEET UNTIL MID TO LATE MORNING.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL PUSH EAST 
TONIGHT.  MOISTURE RETURN AHEAD OF THIS WILL BE SOMEWHAT WEAK BUT 
STILL EXPECT SOME LIGHT RAIN TO MOVE IN THIS EVENING...SO WILL CARRY 
LIKELY POPS SW NC ZONES WITH CHANCE POPS MOST OF THE REMAINDER OF 
THE AREA.  PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT AND PRECIP TYPE 
SHOULD BE RAIN AT THE ONSET...BUT AS PRECIP TAPERS OFF LATE 
TONIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY PRECIP TYPE BECOMES MORE PROBLEMATIC.  MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE ICE CRYSTALLIZATION MAY BE DIFFICULT AS TEMPS DO 
NOT GET VERY COLD IN THE CLOUD LAYER.  ALSO THE MOISTURE GETS RATHER 
SHALLOW.  SURFACE TEMPS MAY DIP BELOW FREEZING ESPECIALLY IN SOME OF 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN LATE TONIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY...SO WILL MENTION SOME 
LIGHT SNOW OR FREEZING DRIZZLE TONIGHT LATE AND WILL MENTION 
FREEZING DRIZZLE EARLY SUNDAY IN SOME OF THESE AREAS.  GIVEN LOW 
CONFIDENCE THAT ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOW OR ICE ACCUMULATIONS WILL OCCUR 
NO WSW PLANNED A THIS TIME.  SUNDAY ANOTHER SHORT WAVE WILL BE 
PUSHING IN LATE...SO WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR FAR 
NORTHEAST ZONES FOR SOME SHOWERS/SNOW SHOWERS. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)... SOME LIGHT
RAIN/WINTRY PRECIP COULD LINGER ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN SUNDAY
EVENING AS ANOTHER UPPER WAVE SCOOTS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.
HOWEVER...DRY AND MILDER CONDITIONS WILL BE THE PRIMARY STORY
HEADING INTO THE NEW WORK WEEK AS SUBTROPICAL RIDGING BUILDS BACK
INTO THE REGION. THIS WILL HELP TO PROMOTE MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS
AND PUSH HIGHS BACK INTO THE 50S AREAWIDE BY TUESDAY.

THE MAIN FOCUS FOR MID TO LATE WEEK CONTINUES TO BE A STRONG 
UPPER-LEVEL STORM SYSTEM PROGGED TO DIG OUT OF THE DESERT 
SOUTHWEST/BAJA CALIFORNIA AND MOVE TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI/OHIO

TUESDAY NIGHT/WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY AND THE ECMWF DOING SO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND ESPECIALLY INTO THE DAY THURSDAY...BEFORE 
TAPERING THINGS OFF BY FRIDAY MORNING. GIVEN THE RECENT PERFORMANCE 
OF THE ECMWF AND THE WAY THE NAM HAS STARTED TO TREND LATE IN ITS 
RUN...HAVE TRENDED MORE TOWARDS THE LATER ECMWF SOLUTION. STILL... 
FELT CONFIDENT ENOUGH THAT SOME PRECIP MAY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON TO GO LOW-END CHANCE POPS THEN...AND HAVE 
RAISED THEM TO THE HIGH-END CHANCE TO LIKELY CATEGORY FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS CONFIDENCE IS INCREASING THAT SOME LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL WILL OCCUR DURING THESE PERIODS. THEN...HAVE THE 
PRECIP TAPERING OFF FROM WEST TO EAST THURSDAY NIGHT /WITH CHANCE 
POPS HUGGING THE E TN/SW NC MOUNTAIN ZONES/. THEREAFTER... WARM AND 
DRY CONDITIONS ARE ANTICIPATED FOR FRIDAY WITH UPPER RIDGING 
BUILDING IN ONCE AGAIN.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE AREA WILL SHIFT EAST DURING THE SHORT TERM.  MOISTURE WILL 
START TO INCREASE SATURDAY AHEAD OF THE UPPER TROUGH LIFTING 
NORTHEAST OUT OF THE PLAINS.  CLOUDS WILL INCREASE DURING THE DAY 
SATURDAY...AND SOME LIGHT SHOWERS MAY MOVE INTO OUR AREA LATE IN THE 
DAY ESPECIALLY SOUTH AND WEST.  WILL INCLUDE A 20 POP LATE FOR ALL 
BUT NORTHEAST ZONES.  WILL UNDERCUT SOME MAV TEMPS SLIGHTLY FOR 
HIGHS SATURDAY GIVEN COLD START AND EXPECTED CLOUD INCREASE...BUT 
OVERALL WILL STAY CLOSE.       

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)... SOME LOW-END
PRECIPITATION CHANCES WILL CONTINUE OVERNIGHT SATURDAY AS A
WEAKENING UPPER-TROUGH PASSES OVER THE REGION. GENERALLY LIGHT RAIN
SHOWERS ARE EXPECTED IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS...BUT SCATTERED SNOW
SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND EAST TENNESSEE THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY MORNING. GIVEN THE
LACK OF DEEP MOISTURE AND LIFT...THIS ACTIVITY IS NOT EXPECTED TO
BE VERY HEAVY...WITH MINOR ACCUMULATIONS OF LESS THAN AN INCH
GENERALLY EXPECTED ALONG THE MOUNTAINS. ANOTHER UPPER-TROUGH WILL
THEN SWING THROUGH THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT AND PUSH A COLD FRONT
THROUGH THE AREA. THIS FRONT WILL BRING SOME COLDER AIR INTO THE
REGION...AND COMBINED WITH SOME WRAP AROUND MOISTURE AND OROGRAPHIC
LIFT...WILL YIELD THE POTENTIAL FOR SOME LIGHT SCATTERED NORTHWEST
FLOW SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN OVERNIGHT.

THEREAFTER...DRIER AND WARMER CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED AS SUBTROPICAL 
RIDGING BUILDS BACK INTO THE REGION FROM THE SOUTH. THE MAIN 
FORECAST CONCERN HEADING INTO NEXT WEEK WILL BE ANOTHER STORM SYSTEM 
PROGGED TO DIG OUT OF BAJA CALIFORNIA/DESERT SOUTHWEST AND TRACK 
EAST TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI RIVER BY MID/LATE WEEK. ATTM...THERE IS 
STILL A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE OF ABOUT 24 HOURS BETWEEN THE GFS AND 
ECMWF ON THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM. THE GFS BRINGS IN DEEP 
MOISTURE/PRECIP LATE TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND THE 
ECMWF WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. GIVEN THE HIGH MODEL 
SPREAD...HAVE OPTED TO NOT GET TOO SPECIFIC REGARDING TIMING...AND 
HAVE MENTIONABLE POPS AREAWIDE WEDNESDAY...AND SOLID CHANCE POPS 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...BEFORE TAPERING THEM OFF FROM WEST TO 
EAST THURSDAY NIGHT. HAVE TRENDED A BIT TOWARD THE ECMWF GIVEN ITS 
PERFORMANCE IN RECENT WEEKS. BY FRIDAY INTO NEXT WEEKEND A BOUT OF 
WARMER AND DRIER WEATHER MAY BE ON THE HORIZON ONCE AGAIN AS 
SUBTROPICAL RIDGING RETURNS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...LAST OF THE CLOUD COVER EXITING 
THE AREA. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD IN DURING THE 
SHORT TERM...AND SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING ACROSS SHOULD 
JUST BRING A FEW HIGH/MID CLOUDS.  WILL GO WITH CLEAR TO MOSTLY 
CLEAR CONDITIONS TONIGHT AND FRIDAY.  MAV/MET TEMPS IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT OVERALL AND LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)... AN UPPER-TROUGH
WILL TRACK NORTHEASTWARD FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT
LAKES THIS WEEKEND...BRINGING WITH IT SOME PRECIP CHANCES SATURDAY
AFTERNOON AND NIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE NOT OVERLY
IMPRESSIVE WITH QPF SIGNALS GIVEN THE LACK OF DEEP MOISTURE...SO
HAVE GONE WITH LOW TO MODERATE CHANCE POPS FOR SCATTERED SHOWERS
MOVING UP FROM THE SW SATURDAY AFTERNOON... FAVORING THE SPINE OF
THE MTNS OVERNIGHT. WITH COLDER AIR WORKING ITS WAY INTO THE REGION
BEHIND THE SYSTEM...SOME LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES ARE
EXPECTED LATE SATURDAY NIGHT/EARLY SUNDAY MORNING /MAINLY ACROSS
THE HIGHER TERRAIN/...WITH MINOR TO NO ACCUMULATIONS EXPECTED.
ANOTHER UPPER-WAVE MOVING THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT WILL
DRAG A WEAK FRONT THROUGH THE AREA. IN ITS WAKE SOME LINGERING
MOISTURE COMBINED WITH NORTHWEST FLOW WINDS COULD YIELD SOME
SCATTERED OROGRAPHICALLY INDUCED SNOW SHOWERS...SO HAVE ADDED A
SLIGHT CHANCE MENTION OF THIS IN THE MTN ZONES OF SW VA AND E TN.

THEREAFTER...DRY CONDITIONS ARE EXPECTED THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE 
WEEK AS UPPER RIDGING MOVES INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN UNITED STATES. 
HOWEVER...LATE IN THE PERIOD THERE IS SIGNIFICANT MODEL DISCREPANCY 
REGARDING THE NEXT UPPER-LOW MOVING EAST FROM THE DESERT SOUTHWEST. 
THE GFS IS MUCH MORE BULLISH WITH THIS SYSTEM AND SHOWS IT TRACKING 
EAST THROUGH THE OHIO/TENNESSEE VALLEYS WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...BRINGING WITH IT SOME VERY GOOD PRECIP CHANCES. THE ECMWF ON 
THE OTHERHAND IS ABOUT A 12-24 HOURS SLOWER...BRING A BULK OF THE 
PRECIP INTO THE REGION LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
EVENING. GIVEN THE DIFFERENCES...HAVE TRIED TO DO SOMEWHAT OF A 
MODEL BLEND...SLIGHTLY FAVORING THE ECMWF. HAVE ADDED LOW-END CHANCE 
POPS IN THE EXTENDED FOR WEDNESDAY EVENING THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT...BUT WILL WAIT FOR LATER MODEL RUNS AND BETTER CONTINUITY 
BEFORE MAKING ANY FURTHER ADJUSTMENTS TO THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MODELS DID NOT HANDLE LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE TRAPPED UNDER AN INVERSION WELL AT ALL ON WEDNESDAY AND 
THERE ARE SIMILARITIES TO THAT DEBACLE THIS MORNING WITH A LOW LEVEL 
SATURATED LAYER STAYING IN PLACE WITH COLD NORTHERLY FLOW NEAR THE 
SURFACE AND SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS ABOVE THIS LEVEL. TRIED TO GO WITH A 
SLOWER EROSION OF CLOUDS TODAY THAN MODEL DEPICTION AND USED THE 
SLIGHTLY COOLER MAV MOS MAX TEMPS AS A LOW AMPLITUDE UPPER TROUGH 
SLIDES EAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. A COLDER 
NIGHT IS IN STORE WITH LESS CLOUD COVER EXPECTED AS SURFACE HIGH 
BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. 

.SHORT TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A CLOSED SOUTHERN STREAM 
LOW OVER THE DESERT SW WILL DRIFT NE AND MERGE WITH A NORTHERN 
STREAM TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS ON FRIDAY. THE GFS IS A BIT WETTER 
THIS THIS SYSTEM THAN YESTERDAY...BUT IT IS STILL THE DRIEST AMONG 
THE NAM/ECMWF/CMC/SREF. THESE MODELS SPREAD RAIN INTO THE AREA FROM 
THE SW SATURDAY AFTERNOON...WITH PRECIP MOVING THROUGH SATURDAY 
NIGHT. SOME COLD ADVECTION AFTER MIDNIGHT WILL CHANGE PRECIP FROM 
RAIN TO SNOW. SINCE THE GFS APPEARS TO BE AN OUTLIER...WILL RAISE 
POPS FOR THESE PERIODS TO A CHANCE...AND LOWER POPS ON SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AS THE DEEP MOISTURE PUSHES TO OUR EAST BY THEN. 

MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY WILL BE DRY WITH A SLIGHT WARMING TREND AS 
A LARGE RIDGE WILL BE OVER MUCH OF THE EASTERN CONUS. A SOUTHERN 
STREAM CLOSED LOW MAY AFFECT THE AREA BEYOND DAY 7.

235 PM EST WED JAN 2 2013

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...WITH WEAK LOW LEVEL FLOW AND 
MOISTURE LINGERING BENEATH THE INVERSION THE LOW CLOUDS OVER THE 
AREA HAVE HELD STUBBORNLY IN PLACE.  WHEN THE LOW CLOUDS DO BREAK UP 
STILL WILL BE SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE AREA...SO EXPECT 
CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS FOR MUCH OF THE NIGHT.  CLEARING SHOULD 
START WORKING IN LATER TONIGHT FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST...THEN 
EXPECT PLENTY OF SUNSHINE FOR THURSDAY AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
CONTINUES TO BUILD IN ALONG WITH DRIER AIR. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE FOR THE SHORT TERM SO WILL STAY CLOSE.    

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MAIN WEATHER CONCERN 
IS THE AMOUNT OF PHASING BETWEEN THE NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM 
WAVES AND EXTENT OF GULF MOISTURE RETURN INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. GFS AND ECMWF AGREE FAIRLY WELL WITH 
A GOOD DEAL OF PHASING BETWEEN THE TWO SYSTEMS...BUT THE GFS IS WEAK 
IN RETURN OF GULF MOISTURE. THE ECMWF AND NAM MODELS SHOW A GOOD 
DEAL MORE MOISTURE/ISENTROPIC LIFT AND ASSOCIATED PRECIPITATION 
MOVING NORTHEAST INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.

SINCE MODELS ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE PHASING OF THE 
TWO WAVES...I PREFER GOING WITH THE HIGHER POPS. INTERESTING THAT 
THE GFS POPS ARE IN THE 30S AND 40S...BUT SHOW LITTLE IN THE WAY OF 
QPF. LATER SHIFTS WILL LIKELY HAVE TO BUMP UP THE POPS.

THE TEMPERATURE PROFILE SHOWS A MIX BAG OF SNOW..SLEET..RAIN AND 
POSSIBLY FREEZING RAIN WITH THIS SYSTEM. SINCE DEWPOINTS WILL BE 
INITIALLY QUITE DRY..A GOOD DEAL OF EVAPORATIVE COOLING EXPECTED 
WHICH WILL HELP COOL COLUMN.

UPPER TROUGH LIFTS OUT FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WITH RIDGING BOTH 
SURFACE AND ALOFT FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED. ANOTHER SYSTEM 
MAY BEGIN TO PULL MOISTURE BACK INTO THE FORECAST FOR MONDAY...BUT 
WILL KEEP DRY FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SHORT WAVE TROUGH WILL SLIP EAST 
OF THE REGION TODAY WHILE COLDER AIR TRIES TO SPILL OVER THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND INTO THE GREAT VALLEY. THIS 
PROCESS IS TAKING A WHILE DUE TO THE FACT THAT THE LOW LEVEL 
PRESSURE GRADIENT IS SOMEWHAT ANEMIC WITH A CONTINUATION OF 
SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS ALOFT. MODELS DEPICT A RELATIVELY QUICK EROSION 
OF THE LOW CLOUD DECK BUT SATELLITE AND OBSERVATIONS REVEAL A RATHER 
BROAD AREA OF MOISTURE BELOW 85H WITH A FAIR AMOUNT OF CIRRUS 
STREAMING OUT OF THE TROPICS. THEREFORE TRIED TO BE A LITTLE MORE 
PESSIMISTIC ON CLOUD COVER ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA...WITH 
PARTS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE BREAKING OUT 
INTO SOME SUNSHINE TOWARD EARLY AFTERNOON. LIGHT PRECIPITATION IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH THE DEPARTING WAVE IS MOVING OUT FAIRLY QUICKLY 
THIS MORNING. SOME OF THE PRECIP ON THE EXTREME NORTHERN FRINGES OF 
THE FORECAST AREA IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS WELL AS ALONG THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN IN NORTHEAST TENNESSEE IS PROBABLY REACHING THE SURFACE AS A 
MIXTURE OF FREEZING DRIZZLE WITH A SNOWFLAKE OR TWO MIXED IN. IN 
THESE AREAS...THE COLDEST AIR HAS ARRIVED WITH TEMPERATURES HOVERING 
CLOSE TO IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW FREEZING. SATURATED AIR IS 
ALSO RESULTING IN SOME FREEZING FOG AS WELL. EXPECT THERE WILL BE A 
FEW SLICK SPOTS IN THIS AREA THIS MORNING WITH THIS LIMITED WINTERY 
SITUATION SO WILL KEEP THE SPS GOING TO HIGHLIGHT. NOT EXPECTING A 
GREAT DEAL OF WARMING TODAY WITH CLOUDS AND COLDER AIR OOZING SOUTH 
SO GENERALLY UNDERCUT GUIDANCE TEMPS. TONIGHT SHOULD BE PARTLY 
CLOUDY BUT DRY AS WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY RIDES NORTHEAST ACROSS THE 
SOUTHEASTERN CORNER OF THE NATION.   

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A POSITIVELY-TILTED MIDLEVEL 
TROUGH WILL BE PUSHING ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT. 
MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED SO THERE WILL BE LITTLE IMMEDIATE IMPACT TO 
THE SENSIBLE WEATHER. HOWEVER COOLER TEMPERATURES WILL FOLLOW FOR 
FRIDAY. 

A RIDGE WILL BE BUILDING IN BRIEFLY FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY BEFORE 
ANOTHER POSITIVELY-TILTED UPPER TROUGH FOLLOWS FOR SATURDAY 
NIGHT/SUNDAY. THIS TROUGH LOOKS DEEPER THAN THE PREVIOUS ONE...WITH 
A BIT MORE MOISTURE TO WORK WITH. STILL...LIFT APPEARS VERY WEAK. 
THE ECMWF AND CANADIAN ARE MORE BULLISH ON PRECIP CHANCES THAN THE 
GFS. WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY. MONDAY AND TUESDAY WILL FEATURE A DRY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT WITH 
HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE...AND NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES.

DAYS 6 AND 7. HOWEVER...STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY FOR SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY WITH POSSIBLY A TARGET OF OPPORTUNITY TO IMPROVE ON THE GFSX 
MOS FOR THOSE PERIODS. 12Z GFS MODEL RUN SHOWS LESS PHASING OF THE 
NRN AND SRN STREAMS ON SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY THAN WITH THE 00Z 
RUN...WHILE THE ECMWF AND CANADIAN MODELS STILL ADVERTISE THE SRN 
STREAM SYSTEM TAPPING INTO A GREAT DEAL OF GULF MOISTURE FOR

...BUT THIS DOES WARRANT ADDING A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR THE ENTIRE

WOULD BE SOME LIGHT SNOW OR RAIN LIMITED TO MAINLY THE NRN PLATEAU

GFS SHOW STRONG MIDLEVEL DRY ADVECTION AS A 850-700 MB SHORTWAVE
TROUGH MOVES THROUGH...WHICH SHOULD QUICKLY END ALL PRECIP BY 09Z.
COLD ADVECTION ALSO KICKS IN AT THE SAME TIME...SO WHILE THERE MAY
BE A CHANGE TO SNOW...IT WILL BE VERY BRIEF BEFORE ENDING...WITH
VERY LITTLE ACCUMULATION.

CLEARING OF LOW CLOUDS WILL COME WEDNESDAY MORNING...WITH MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES BY THE AFTERNOON. DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. A BROAD TROUGH WITH POSITIVE TILT 
WILL APPROACH THE AREA ON THURSDAY...BUT WITH VERY LITTLE MOISTURE 
ALOFT TO WORK WITH...WE WILL STAY DRY WITH MAYBE JUST A SLIGHT 
INCREASE IN HIGH CLOUD COVER NORTH. TEMPERATURES THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM PERIOD WILL BE FORECAST LOWER THAN MOS...WHICH HAS BEEN TOO 
WARM THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
BASICALLY STAYED THE COURSE FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST WHICH
FEATURES A BUILDING UPPER LEVEL AND SURFACE RIDGE FRIDAY INTO
SATURDAY. MODELS NOT ENTIRELY IN AGREEMENT WITH SPLIT FLOW PATTERN
OVER THE WEEKEND. BOTH THE 00Z ECMWF AND GFS DEPICT A MORE PHASED
AND THUS STRONGER SYSTEM WHICH INDICATES DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT
SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. THE CANADIAN IS GENERALLY WEAKER EARLY
IN THE WEEKEND WITH MORE SEPARATION BETWEEN NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN
STREAMS BUT ENDS THE WEEKEND (SUNDAY) WITH AN AMPLIFIED NORTHERN
BRANCH SYSTEM. FORECAST UNCERTAINTY IS STILL RATHER HIGH WITH
DIFFERING MODEL SOLUTIONS DURING THIS PERIOD SO KEPT A DRY FORECAST
GOING THROUGH MONDAY. DID NOT STRAY TOO FAR FROM MEX MOS GUIDANCE
WHICH FEATURES A MODEST WARMING TREND.
