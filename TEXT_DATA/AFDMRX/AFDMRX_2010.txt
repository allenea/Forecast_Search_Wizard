.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST AND WEAKEN OVER THE AREA. A COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE EAST INTO MIDDLE TENNESSEE TONIGHT. WARM AIR ADVECTION WILL 
INCREASE IN STRENGTH. TEMPERATURES ABOUT 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL 
TODAY AND WELL ABOVE NORMAL TONIGHT. PERIODS OF SUNSHINE TODAY WITH 
CLOUDY SKIES TONIGHT. LIGHT PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE IN FROM THE WEST 
MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN CONCERN CONTINUES TO 
BE A SYSTEM PROGGED INTO THE REGION ON SATURDAY.  WITH STRONG 
WARMING WITH THE SYSTEM...TEMPERATURES WILL CLIMB INTO THE 50S 
ACROSS THE CWA FOR AN ALL RAIN EVENT.  PRECIP AMOUNTS EXPECTED TO BE 
FROM A HALF INCH TO AN INCH...AND WITH SNOW REMAINING AT HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...THE COMBINATION OF SNOWMELT AND RUNOFF COULD BE AN 
ISSUE.  THE FRONT AND ASSOCIATED PRECIP SHOULD MOVE THROUGH FAIRLY 
QUICKLY WITH SHOWERS LINGERING SATURDAY EVENING AND ENDING 
OVERNIGHT.  WILL MOVE INTO A DRY PERIOD BEHIND THE SYSTEM.  FLOW 
ALOFT BECOMES ZONAL BY MONDAY FOR A GENERALLY DRY FORECAST THROUGH 
THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.  HOWEVER...THERE ARE A COUPLE OF WEAK 
WAVES MOVING THROUGH DURING THE PERIOD...ONE ON TUESDAY AND ANOTHER 
ON THURSDAY.  THE ONE OF TUESDAY IS VERY WEAK WITH LITTLE MOISTURE 
AND ONLY EXPECT TO SEE A BRIEF INCREASE IN CLOUDS AS IT MOVES 
THROUGH.  THE SHORT WAVE PROGGED INTO THE AREA ON THURSDAY IS 
STRONGER WITH DECENT MOISTURE...BUT MAIN ENERGY SHOULD STAY TO OUR 
SOUTH.  IF THIS WAVE TRACKS A BIT FARTHER NORTH...IT COULD BRING 
SOME PRECIP INTO THE AREA.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK UPPER RIDGE WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH FRIDAY WITH LOW LEVEL SOUTHWEST 
FLOW CONTINUING. THIS WILL RESULT IN CONTINUED WARMING ACROSS THE 
AREA WITH TEMPS MUCH ABOVE NORMAL FOR FRIDAY. SCATTERED TO BROKEN 
LOW-MID CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO ALSO STREAM NORTHEAST INTO THE 
REGION WITH SOME BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS THROUGH FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE 
WITH PARTLY SUNNY FORECAST FOR FRIDAY BASED UPON EXPECTED TRENDS. 
WILL ALSO GO CLOSER TO GFS TEMPS ACROSS THE AREA. 


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN CONCERN FOR THE 
LONG TERM CONTINUES TO BE THE POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM ON 
SATURDAY. LATEST MODEL RUNS CONTINUE TO SHOW UPPER LEVEL FLOW 
SIGNIFICANTLY AMPLIFYING IN ADVANCE OF THE SYSTEM WITH STRENGTHENING 
SOUTHERLY FLOW. TIMING REMAINS REASONABLY CONSISTENT. WITH TEMPS 
PROJECTED TO CLIMB TO OVER 10 DEGREES C AT 850 MB ON SATURDAY...AND 
WITH QPFS IN THE 0.5 TO 1.0 INCH RANGE...SNOW MELT/RUNOFF COULD 
BECOME AN ISSUE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. ABOUT THE ONLY UNCERTAINTY
WITH THIS EVENT IS HOW FAST IT WILL EXIT WITH THE NAM CONTINUING TO
KEEP SOME PRECIP IN THE AREA INTO EARLY SUNDAY.

REMAINDER OF FORECAST APPEARS GENERALLY TRANQUIL AT THIS TIME AS 
UPPER FLOW DEAMPLIFIES INTO A FAST...NEARLY ZONAL FLOW. MINOR 
SHORTWAVES TRANSLATE THROUGH THIS FLOW...BUT NONE ARE SIGNIFICANT 
ENOUGH TO WARRANT POPS. THUS CONTINUED DRY FORECAST FROM SUNDAY 
THROUGH THURSDAY. TEMPS SHOULD RANGE NEAR CLIMO IN THIS REGIME. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED SLIGHTLY COOLER HPC VALUES.

TEMPERATURES ARE HOVERING RIGHT AROUND THE FREEZING MARK OR A FEW 
DEGREES BELOW. STAYED WITH THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT FOR THIS 
POSSIBILITY BUT IT SHOULD BE RATHER LIMITED AS PRECIPITATION WILL BE 
VERY LIGHT AND WARMER AIR STREAMING IN ALOFT SHOULD BOOST SURFACE 
TEMPERATURES ABOVE FREEZING IN THIS AREA FAIRLY QUICKLY THIS 
MORNING. MAINTAINED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF RAIN INTO THE AFTERNOON BUT 
NOT HOPEFUL THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL PRODUCE ANYTHING MORE THAN SPOTTY 
LIGHT RAIN OR DRIZZLE. KEPT A DRY FORECAST GOING TONIGHT AS RIDGING 
STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF NEXT SYSTEM.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AN INCREASING SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW WILL TRANSPORT WARMER TEMPERATURES AND GULF MOISTURE INTO THE 
AREA FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. HIGHS WILL REACH THE 55 TO 60 RANGE IN 
MOST SPOTS FRIDAY. LIFT WILL INCREASE FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER JET 
ON THE EAST SIDE OF AN UPPER LOW IN THE PLAINS MOVES INTO THE MS/OH 
VALLEY REGION. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH TIMING...AND POPS 
RISE TO CATEGORICAL BY SATURDAY MORNING. STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE 
ACTING ON SOME WEAK ELEVATED INSTABILITY MAY BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE 
OF THUNDERSTORMS TO WESTERN AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS SATURDAY MORNING. 
STRONG MOISTURE TRANSPORT AND GOOD LIFT COMBINED WITH A SLOW-MOVING 
FRONT SHOULD MEAN A POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN...WITH OVER 1 INCH QPF 
EXPECTED IN SOUTHERN AREAS. A SOUTHERLY 850 MB JET AROUND 50 KTS MAY 
ALSO BRING A MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT LATE FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY MORNING. 

PRECIP SHIFTS EAST OF THE AREA...WITH DECREASING POPS SATURDAY 
NIGHT. THE UPPER FLOW CONTINUES TO BE FROM THE SW...SO THE PUSH OF 
COLD AIR LAGS THE SURFACE FRONT. THE PASSAGE OF THE UPPER TROUGH ON 
SUNDAY WILL BRING STRONGER COLD ADVECTION...AND TEMPS MAY FALL 
THROUGH THE AFTERNOON DESPITE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. A ZONAL FLOW WILL 
DEVELOP FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD. MODELS INDICATE SOME 
SHORTWAVES PASSING THROUGH THE FLOW...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LACKING IN 
THESE FEATURES...SO WILL KEEP MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY DRY.

311 PM EST WED DEC 29 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...WEAK SHORT WAVE AT 500
MILLIBARS MOVING NORTHEAST THROUGH ARKANSAS WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD
WARM ADVECTION...LOW-MID CLOUDS AND SCATTERED LIGHT PRECIP TOWARD
THE FORECAST AREA EARLY THURSDAY AND INTO THURSDAY AFTERNOON.
RECENT 988-D RETURNS FROM AREA RADARS DO INDICATE SOME LIGHT PRECIP
MOVING NORTHEAST THROUGH MIDDLE TENNESSEE AS OF 1830Z THIS
AFTERNOON. 

MODELS DIFFER IN PRECIP TIMING TONIGHT...WITH GFS BEING A LITTLE
MORE AGRESSIVE IN MOVING LIGHT PRECIP NORTHEAST TOWARD THE FORECAST
AREA...COMPARED TO SLOWER NAM. WILL GO WITH A COMPROMISE. BELIEVE
THAT TIMING WILL BE CLOSE IN NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA COUNTIES...AND WILL KEEP IN MENTION OF LIGHT MIXTURE OF
RAIN/FREEZING RAIN. AT THIS TIME...WILL NOT GO AHEAD WITH WINTER
WEATHER ADVISORY...BUT WILL HANDLE WITH A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT
TO HIGHLIGHT CHANCE OF SOME MIXED INITIAL PRECIP. TEMPS HAVE A
COUPLE OF HOURS TIME PERIOD TOWARD 12Z WHERE THEY WILL BE AROUND 32
DEGREES IN TRI/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...BUT WILL NOT BE MAKING MUCH IN
WAY OF GOING FORECAST CHANGES...AS FEEL THAT CURRENT FORECAST IS IN
PRETTY GOOD SHAPE. 

WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS ON THURSDAY...WITH SYSTEM MOVING THE
REST OF THE WAY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY AROUND/SHORTLY AFTER
18Z TIME FRAME.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A STRONG RIDGE WILL BE 
OVER THE EASTERN SEABOARD THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...WITH A CLOSED 
LOW DEVELOPING OVER THE CENTRAL ROCKIES AND TRACKING NORTHEASTWARD 
TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES. THE LOW WILL DEPRESS THE RIDGE AND ALLOW THE 
FOLLOWING DEEP TROUGH TO MOVE EAST. THIS WILL PLACE THE TN VALLEY 
REGION IN A DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW...RESULTING IN ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES. 

ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW FOLLOWS THE UPPER LOW OVER THE GREAT LAKES, 
AND SURFACE FRONT EXTENDS SOUTH OVER SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY EARLY 
SATURDAY. THE FRONT SHOWS SIGNS OF WEAKENING IN THE CENTRAL PORTIONS 
OVER THE TN VALLEY REGION, WHICH IMPLIES IN THE GFS A BIT OF A 
LOWERING OF QPF AMOUNTS.

PRECIP CHANCES WILL BEGIN RISING FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS GULF MOISTURE 
TRANSPORT INCREASES AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT. GENERAL MODEL CONSENSUS 
HAS SLOWED THE FRONT AND HENCE THE PRECIP CHANCES HAVE BEEN RAISED A 
BIT FOR SATURDAY. LOOKS LIKE BEST TIMING FOR HEAVIEST RAIN WILL BE 
FROM ABOUT SATURDAY 12Z TO ABOUT SUNDAY 12Z. P

BIGGEST ISSUE RIGHT NOW IS SNOW PACK IN THE MOUNTAINS AND FOOTHILLS 
ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA LINE AND IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THIS WILL 
MELT QUITE A BIT BETWEEN NOW AND WHEN THE WEEKEND RAINS HIT, BUT THE 
SOIL WILL LIKELY BE QUITE MOIST, PROVIDING A BIT OF A FLOOD 
POTENTIAL. IF THE SNOW DOES NOT MELT AND LEAVES A SUBSTANTIAL PACK, 
THE WE MIGHT HAVE A PROBLEM, ESPECIALLY IN SMALLER STREAMS COMING 
OUT OF THE MOUNTAINS. WILL ADVISE FOLLOWING SHIFTS TO BE AWARE OF 
POSSIBLE STATEMENTS OR WATCHES.

POPS END BY SUNDAY WITH SLIGHTLY COOLER TEMPS...BUT AS UPPER LOW 
SPEEDS ON EAST...A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPS AND SHOULD MEAN 
TEMPS CLOSE TO NORMAL FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. 

PREVIOUS SUPPORT FOR A TUESDAY SYSTEM SOUTH OF US HAS ALL BUT ERODED 
AND BUT ON THURSDAY ANOTHER FRONT LOOMS ON THE FAR HORIZON. PUT SOME 
SLIGHT CHANCE LOW CHANCE IN EARLY THURSDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WEAK SHORT WAVE MOVING EAST 
TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI/OHIO VALLEY WILL CONTINUE ON ITS TREK ACROSS 
THE MID SOUTH TODAY AND TONIGHT. CLOUDS WILL BE ON THE INCREASE 
TODAY IN ASSOCIATION WITH THIS SYSTEM. ATMOSPHERE MOISTENS 
SUFFICIENTLY ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN ISENTROPIC LIFT FOR SOME 
LIGHT RAIN PRODUCTION MAINLY AFFECTING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. THE 
WARM/MOIST SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL GENERATE LIQUID PRECIP ALOFT BUT MAY 
BE IN THE FORM OF LIGHT FREEZING RAIN ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA IN THE LOCATION OF THE COLDEST MIN TEMPS AROUND 
FREEZING OR JUST BELOW. WEAKENING SHORT WAVE PRESSES STEADILY EAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY MID DAY. TRENDED CHANCE POPS 
BACK THROUGH THE DAY IN SYNC WITH MODEL DEPICTION OF DECREASING 
MOISTURE/LIFT AS FORECAST AREA AWAITS STRONGER LATE WEEK SYSTEM. 
STAYED PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...A STRONG RIDGE WILL BE 
OVER THE EASTERN SEABOARD THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...WITH A CLOSED 
LOW TRACKING NORTHEASTWARD ACROSS THE PLAINS. THIS WILL PLACE THE TN 
VALLEY REGION IN A DEEP SOUTHWEST FLOW...RESULTING IN ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES. 

PRECIP CHANCES WILL BEGIN RISING FRIDAY AFTERNOON AS THE CLOSED LOW 
TRACKS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES AND GULF MOISTURE TRANSPORT INCREASES 
AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT NEAR THE MS VALLEY. GENERAL MODEL CONSENSUS IS 
FOR THE BEST LIFT TO BE OVER OUR AREA LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
MORNING. WILL RAISE POPS THIS TIME PERIOD TO LIKELY. THE COLD FRONT 
IS SLOW TO MOVE ACROSS THE AREA DUE TO A SW FLOW ALOFT...SO PRECIP 
CHANCES LINGER INTO SATURDAY NIGHT. POPS END BY SUNDAY WITH SLIGHTLY 
COOLER TEMPS...BUT A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW ALOFT SHOULD MEAN TEMPS CLOSE 
TO NORMAL FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. 

THE GFS HINTS AT A WEAK SYSTEM DEVELOPING TO OUR SOUTH ON 
TUESDAY...BUT THIS HAS NO SUPPORT FROM THE ECMWF AND THERE IS 
CONSIDERABLE SPREAD AMONG GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS...SO WILL KEEP

343 AM EST TUE DEC 28 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL EXTEND NORTHWARD FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE EASTERN CONUS TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS WILL 
PROVIDE MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND WARMER TEMPERATURES. BY WEDNESDAY 
HIGH TEMPS WILL BE CLOSER TO NORMAL...IN THE 40S TO NEAR 50. 

ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT THE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS TO THE EASTERN 
SEABOARD...AND A MID/UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVE EAST ACROSS 
TX AND THE GULF COAST. WARM ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF 
THIS TROUGH WILL BRING A CHANCE OF RAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT. SURFACE 
TEMPS WILL BE CLOSE TO FREEZING AT THE ONSET WITH A STRENGTHENING 
WARM NOSE ALOFT...SO THERE IS A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SOME FREEZING RAIN 
IN NORTHEAST SECTIONS LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. BUT IT SHOULD BE 
FLEETING AS WARM ADVECTION TAKES OVER BY THURSDAY MORNING. A DEEP SW 
FLOW AND A GULF MOISTURE FEED WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF RAIN ACROSS THE 
AREA THROUGH THURSDAY...THOUGH FORCING LOOKS WEAK. TEMPERATURES WILL 
NUDGE A BIT ABOVE NORMAL...WITH HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO 00Z ECMWF DEPICTION OF THIS PERIOD.
TRIMMED BACK POPS A BIT THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. FORECAST AREA
MAY ALREADY BE IN THE WARM SECTOR OF CENTRAL U.S. SYSTEM AND MODELS
SHOWED HIGHER MEAN RH AND LIFT ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO
THE CENTRAL LAKES CLOSER TO THE SURFACE COLD FRONT. HIGHLY
AMPLIFIED SYSTEM PRESSES SLOWLY EAST INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION BY SATURDAY AND ADJUSTED POPS FOR SHOWERS A LITTLE HIGHER AS
THE COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. SLOWED THE FRONTAL
PUSH DOWN A LITTLE BY INCREASING POPS TO A SMALL DEGREE SATURDAY
NIGHT AS UPPER TROF RIPS NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES WITH THE
SOUTHERN END OF THE TROF TRAILING WELL BACK TO THE SOUTHWEST ACROSS
THE CENTRAL PLAINS. IF THIS SCENARIO OCCURS...FRONT MAY BE VERY
SLOW IN ITS TRANSIT ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST AND MAY HAVE TO ADJUST
POPS UP A LITTLE FOR SUNDAY. FOR NOW JUST STAYED WITH A SLIGHT
CHANCE POP ON SUNDAY AS UPPER LEVEL FLOW PARALLELS FRONT. WAS ABLE
TO KEEP THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST PRECIP FREE AS DRIER WESTERLY
FLOW BUILDS IN WITH SURFACE RIDGE SETTLING SOUTH ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE TRANSITION TO A NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW EVENT HAS BEGUN AS THE 
850-700 MB TROUGH AXIS SHIFTS TO OUR EAST AND A SURFACE LOW BOMBS 
OFF THE CAROLINA COAST. THE POSITION OF THE LOW OFF THE COAST WILL 
CREATE A 925-850 FLOW FROM DUE NORTH THIS MORNING...TURNING TO A 
MORE NW DIRECTION AND INCREASING TO 20+ KTS THIS AFTERNOON AS THE 
LOW TRACKS NORTHEAST. STEEP LAPSE RATES UNDER THE 500 MB CIRCULATION 
WILL GENERATE SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA TODAY. THE 
MOVEMENT OF THE UPPER LOW TO THE EAST WILL DECREASE SYNOPTIC LIFT 
AND INSTABILITY TONIGHT...SO AFTER 00Z MOST OF THE SNOW ACCUMULATION 
IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY AND PLATEAU SHOULD END. DECREASING MOISTURE 
DEPTH AND DIMINISHING NW FLOW SHOULD BRING AN END TO MOST OF THE 
ACCUMULATING SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS AND SW VA MONDAY AFTERNOON. 

SOME VALLEY LOCATIONS IN THE ADVISORY COULD PICK UP AN ADDITIONAL 
1-3 INCHES TODAY...DEPENDING ON WHERE THE HEAVIER SHOWERS HIT. 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE WARNING AREA COULD SEE 3-6 INCHES 
TODAY...AND ANOTHER 3-6 TONIGHT AS THE STRONG NW FLOW PERSISTS. THE 
NAM SHOWS INSTABILITY AND DEEP MOISTURE PERSISTING IN THE NORTH PAST 
00Z MON...SO THE ADVISORY FOR NE TN AND SW VA WILL BE EXTENDED TO 
MIDNIGHT. THE REST OF THE ADVISORY AREA AND THE WINTER STORM WARNING 
WILL REMAIN AS IS. WITH THE STRENGTHENING NW FLOW THIS AFTERNOON...A 
WIND ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE TN MOUNTAINS...FROM 21Z TO 18Z 
MONDAY. WIND CHILLS WILL ALSO REACH DANGEROUS VALUES...AND WILL 
HIGHLIGHT THIS IN THE CURRENT WSW PRODUCT.

TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. A SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES ON 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN THE DEEPEST MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE. A WEAKER 
SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH ON FRIDAY WITH LIMITED MOISTURE SO KEPT ONLY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY. A FRONT ENTERS THE REGION ON SATURDAY

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
416 AM EST SAT DEC 25 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
LIGHT SNOW IS MOVING INTO THE AREA...ASSOCIATED WITH LARGE SCALE 
LIFT AHEAD OF THE NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH NOW MOVING INTO THE 
OHIO VALLEY. PRECIP FALLING INTO DRY AIR IN THE LOW LEVELS WILL COOL 
SURFACE TEMPS CLOSE TO FREEZING...SO THE MAJORITY OF PRECIP WILL BE 
SNOW. THE SOUTHERN STREAM CIRCULATION OVER EAST TX WILL BECOME A 
MORE SIGNIFICANT PLAYER LATER TODAY. MODELS HAVE CONVERGED ON A 
SOLUTION THAT SHOWS THE DEFORMATION ZONE TO THE NORTH OF THIS 
CIRCULATION STRENGTHENING...SETTING UP A BAND OF FRONTOGENETIC 
FORCING OVER NORTHERN GA/SE TN/SW NC/UPSTATE SC BY THE AFTERNOON. SO 
WHILE NORTHERN AREAS MAY SEE THE MOST ACCUMULATIONS THIS 
MORNING...SOUTHERN AREAS ARE LIKELY TO SEE MORE THROUGH THE DAY. THE 
FORECAST WILL BE ADJUSTED TO RAISE ACCUMULATIONS OVER SW NC. WILL 
KEEP AMOUNTS WITHIN ADVISORY CRITERIA...UNDER 4 INCHES...BUT GREATER 
AMOUNTS ARE CERTAINLY POSSIBLE DEPENDING ON WHERE THE FRONTOGENESIS 
ZONE SETS UP. WILL EXTEND THE END TIME OF THE WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORY TO 00Z SUN.  

THE PASSAGE OF THE 850-700 MB TROUGH AXIS TONIGHT WILL SIGNAL A 
TRANSITION TO A NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW EVENT. ACCUMULATIONS OVERNIGHT 
MAY BE RELATIVELY LIGHT AS THE FLOW IS NEARLY FROM DUE NORTH AT 
AROUND 15 KTS. BUT AS CYCLOGENESIS BEGINS NEAR THE NC COAST...THE 
925-850 MB FLOW WILL TURN TO THE NORTHWEST AND STRENGTHEN TO 20-30 
KTS...IDEAL FOR UPSLOPE-ENHANCED SNOW SHOWERS. STEEP LAPSE RATES AND 
LOW LEVEL CAPE NEAR 50 J/KG WILL GENERATE ADDITIONAL SNOW SHOWERS 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND INTO SUNDAY EVENING...MAINLY ACROSS NORTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE AREA. DECREASING MOISTURE AND A WEAKENING NW FLOW 
SHOULD LEAD TO SHOWERS TAPERING OFF MONDAY. SNOW ACCUMULATIONS FROM 
THE NW FLOW EVENT WILL VARY CONSIDERABLY DEPENDING ON ELEVATION. THE 
SMOKIES AND NE TN MOUNTAINS WILL RANGE FROM 5-12 INCHES...WITH SW VA 
RANGING FROM 3-9 INCHES. CONSIDERED UPGRADING TO A WARNING FOR THIS 
AREA...BUT SINCE THE NW FLOW SNOW DOES NOT BEGIN IN EARNEST UNTIL 
AFTER 12Z SUNDAY...THE CURRENT WINTER STORM WATCH WILL BE MAINTAINED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN 
ON MONDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE EVENING 
HOURS.  HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ACROSS THE REGION PROVIDING DRY FOR 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. A FRONT ENTERS THE AREA THURSDAY THAT LINGERS 
INTO FRIDAY. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING FOR BOTH PERIODS. SHOULD 
SEE A WARMING TREND FOR THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES.

248 PM EST FRI DEC 24 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...INTERESTING FORECAST WITH 12Z 
MODEL RUN NOT HELPING OUT WITH CONFIDENCE. PER NCEP DISCUSSION...12Z 
MODEL RUN HAD A GOOD DEAL OF INITIALIZATION ERRORS WITH SOME MAJOR 
DIFFERENCES FOR THE FIRST 24 HOURS FOR THE FORECAST AREA. NAM IS 
MUCH MORE AGRESSIVE IN RESPECT TO DYNAMICS (FRONTOGENETIC) THAN THE 
GFS...THUS PRINTS NEARLY 2/10THS INCH OF PRECIPITATION WHILE THE GFS 
IS LARGELY DRY THROUGH 18Z SATURDAY. THE PRECIPITATION MAY BEGIN AS 
A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW OVER THE SOUTHERN COUNTIES BEFORE 
CHANGING TO SNOW. PLAN ON GOING WITH PERSISTENCE...WHICHS FOLLOWS 
HPC SNOWFALL GUIDANCE WITH 1 TO 2 INCHES MAXIMUM FOR HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS INCLUDING THE PLATEAU COUNTIES AND 1/2 TO 1 INCH FOR THE 
LOWER ELEVATIONS. THE SNOWFALL FALLS IN THE LOWER END OF ADVISORY 
CRITERIA...BUT DUE TO THE HOLIDAY TRAVELING WILL ISSUE AN ADVISORY 
AREA-WIDE FROM MIDNIGHT TONIGHT TO NOON CHRISTMAS DAY.

THERE WILL LIKELY BE A LULL IN THE SNOWFALL MID-DAY...BUT AS SURFACE 
LOW STRENGTHS OVER THE GULF THEN RIDES NORTHEAST...STRENGTHENING 
NORTHWEST FLOW WILL DEVELOP FOR LATE SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY 
MORNING. ALSO...UPPER TROUGH WILL RIDE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS PRODUCING ADDITIONAL INSTABILITY WITH FAIRLY STEEP 
LAPSE RATES. CROSS-SECTIONS SHOW STRONG OROGRAPHIC LIFT DEVELOPING 
SATURDAY NIGHT WITH GOOD OMEGA IN THE DENDRITIC GROWTH ZONE. WILL 
CALL FOR AN ADDITIONAL 6 TO 12 INCHES FOR THE FAVORED NORTHWEST 
FACING SLOPES OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN...THUS WILL ISSUE AN WINTER 
STORM WATCH.

DUE TO THE STEEP LAPSE RATES PRODUCING SNOW SHOWERS (SQUALLS) IN THE 
VALLEY...WE MAY NEED TO RE-ISSUE ANOTHER ADVISORY FOR THE NORTHERN 
AND CENTRAL SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...CONTINUE TO TREND COLDER THAN GUIDANCE HIGHS 
DUE TO THE PRECIPITATION...CLOUDS AND COLD AIR ADVECTION.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...OTHER THAN A FEW 
LINGERING FLURRIES OVER HIGHER ELEVATIONS MONDAY NIGHT...EXPECT HIGH 
PRESSURE TO DOMINATE WITH DRY AND WARMING CONDITIONS FOR THE FIRST 
PART OF THE EXTENDED.  THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM MOVES IN AROUND THE 
THURSDAY/FRIDAY TIME FRAME.  CONFIDENCE REMAINS LOW ON TIMING AND 
DETAILS OF THE SYSTEM...SO 20 TO 30 POPS REASONABLE FOR NOW.  AS FAR 
AS TEMPS...GUIDANCE LOOKS GOOD AND STAYED CLOSE.

401 AM EST FRI DEC 24 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...
MODEL TRENDS FOR THE WEEKEND ARE PUTTING MORE EMPHASIS ON THE 
NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH DEVELOPING INTO A CLOSED UPPER LOW...WHILE 
THE SOUTHERN STREAM TROUGH REMAINS SEPARATE AND FARTHER SOUTH OF OUR 
AREA. THIS WILL LIKELY TRANSLATE INTO LESS MOISTURE AVAILABILITY 
AND A FASTER-MOVING SYSTEM...WHICH SHOULD HELP LIMIT SNOW 
ACCUMULATION. 

THE FIRST STAGE OF THE EVENT WILL BEGIN FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER 
TROUGH MOVES INTO THE OHIO VALLEY...AND AN UPPER LEVEL JET 
STRENGTHENS OVER MIDDLE TN TO THE CENTRAL APPALCHIANS. THIS PERIOD 
OF SYNOPTIC LIFT WILL BE SHORT-LIVED...OCCURRING MAINLY BETWEEN 
MIDNIGHT AND SUNRISE. WIDESPREAD SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL LIKELY BE 
LESS THAN 2 INCHES IN BOTH THE VALLEY AND MOUNTAINS...WHICH IS UNDER 
ADVISORY CRITERIA. A DRY SLOT UNDER THE EASTWARD-MOVING JET AND THE 
LOSS OF SYNOPTIC FORCING SHOULD RESULT IN DECREASING PRECIP CHANCES 
THROUGH THE DAY SATURDAY...WITH ANY ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS 
BEING VERY LIGHT. 

THE CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL TRACK SLOWLY ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS SATURDAY NIGHT...AND THE EVENT WILL TRANSITION TO A 
NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN THAT PERSISTS THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS WILL 
MEAN LITTLE IF ANY ACCUMULATION FOR THE VALLEY AND GREATER 
ACCUMULATIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS. NORTHWESTERLY 850 MB WINDS WILL 
INCREASE FROM ABOUT 15 KTS SATURDAY NIGHT TO AROUND 25 KTS SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON. COOLING MIDLEVEL TEMPS SUNDAY AFTERNOON WILL ALSO PRODUCE 
STEEP LAPSE RATES FOR SNOW SHOWERS. THE TN MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF SW VA COULD SEE ACCUMULATIONS ON THE ORDER OF 3-6 
INCHES FROM THE NW FLOW...BUT BECAUSE IT IS OVER A 36 HOUR 
PERIOD...WILL NOT ISSUE A WATCH. ADVISORIES MAY BE NEEDED IN THE 
MOUNTAINS AS WE GET CLOSER TO THIS PORTION OF THE EVENT.

THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT WILL BE CONTINUED TO MENTION LIGHT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE VALLEY THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH THE 
MOUNTAINS SEEING GREATER ACCUMULATIONS THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER LOW EAST OF THE AREA BY 
MONDAY. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES 
FOR THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA.  HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN ON 
MONDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE EVENING HOURS.  
HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS ACROSS THE REGION PROVIDING DRY FOR TUESDAY 
AND WEDNESDAY. A FRONT ENTERS THE AREA THURSDAY. WITH STILL SOME 
UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING...WILL ADD ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW.  
SHOULD SEE A WARMING TREND FOR THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC 
GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

309 PM EST THU DEC 23 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...LOW CLOUDS REMAIN ACROSS
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA OF CLOUDS WILL
SLOWLY ERODE...BUT GIVE WAY TO INCREASING MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS
CURRENTLY OVER THE MID-SECTION OF THE NATION.

MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS DEVELOPING DEEP UPPER TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION. NAM IS VERY WEAK WITH THIS SYSTEM
WHILE THE ECMWF AND LATEST GFS ARE COMING TO AGREEMENT. THE SYSTEM
IS QUITE COMPLEX WITH A NORTHERN AND SOUTHERN STREAM COMPONENT. THE
AMOUNT OF PHASING BETWEEN THE TWO WAVES IS THE BIG QUESTION. THE
ENERGY FROM THE NORTHERN WAVE WEAKENS AS IT MOVES TOWARD THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WITH THE SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE BECOMING
DOMINANT SYSTEM. HOWEVER...ENOUGH SYNOPTIC FORCING AND MOISTURE TO
PRODUCE 1 TO 3 INCH SNOWFALLS ACROSS THE AREA (GENERALY 1 TO
POSSIBLY 2 INCHES VALLEY AND 2 TO 3 INCHES HIGHER ELEVATIONS)

SOUTHERN STREAM PRODUCES CYCLOGENESIS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST UNITED
STATES WITH LOW MOVING OFF THE MID-ATLANTIC COASTS SUNDAY AND
MONDAY. NORTHWEST FLOW BEHIND THIS SYSTEM AND UPPER TROUGH OVER THE
EASTERN UNITED STATES WILL CONTINUE SNOW SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OF 3 TO 6 INCHES
FOR FAVORED NORTHWEST FLOW UPSLOPE AREAS TO DUSTING TO 1 INCH VALLEY.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...CONTINUED TREND OF GOING A CAT OR TWO BELOW
GUIDANCE HIGHS DUE TO THE PRECIPITATION...CLOUDS...AND COLD AIR ADVECTION.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THOUGH THURSDAY)...A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS 
OR FLURRIES MAY CONTINUE INTO MONDAY NIGHT ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
AS THE WEEKEND/S WEATHER SYSTEM CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY.  BEHIND THE 
SYSTEM...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BRINGING 
A RETURN TO QUIET WEATHER.  CONFIDENCE LOW BY THE END OF THE 
EXTENDED WITH SOME MODELS TRENDING TOWARD MOVING THE NEXT SYSTEM 
INTO THE AREA FOR THURSDAY.  FOR NOW...WILL LEAVE THINGS DRY.  
GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOK REASONABLE AND STAYED CLOSE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE WIND STREAMLINES FROM 
NORTHWEST, WEAK COLD ADVECTION, AND RELATIVELY LOW DEWPOINT 
DEPRESSIONS ENABLING A CLOUD MASS TO MOVE SOUTH ACROSS FORECAST AREA 
THIS MORNING. CEILINGS LOWERING AS DECK MOVES SOUTH. IN AGREEMENT 
WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST PACKAGE...WAS LESS OPTIMISTIC THAN MODELS 
WITH BREAKING OUT CLEARING DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE DAY THURSDAY 
AS IT APPEARS LOW DECK MAY HANG AROUND FOR A FEW HOURS BEFORE 
BREAKING OUT TO SOME SUNSHINE. SUCKER HOLES HAVE APPEARED IN THE 
CLOUDS BUT SEEM TO EVENTUALLY FILL IN, HOWEVER. "SUNSHINE" MAY BE 
TOO STRONG A WORD BUT "DISCERNIBLE SHADOWS" WILL NOT FIT INTO THE 
FORECAST.

REMOVED ALL MENTION OF PRECIP FROM ZONES TODAY AND LOWERED POPS FROM 
17 TO 14 IN FAR NORTHEAST PORTION OF FORECAST AREA IN SOUTHWEST VA 
IN ORDER TO REMOVE SUCH WORDING.

OTHER ITEM OF INTEREST IS THE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHICH IS GOOD UNTIL 7 AM. WILL PROBABLY LET IT 
EXPIRE THEN AS LATEST OBS SHOW WEAKENING WINDS AND LITTLE GUSTINESS, 
AND MODELS AGREE WITH REALITY FOR ONCE.

TEMPS LOOK IN GOOD AGREEMENT AS LONG AS THE BLEND IS USED...SO WENT 
WITH THIS.


.LONG TERM...(CHRISTMAS EVE THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...23/00Z RUN OF NAM
AND GFS FLIPPING BACK TO MORE MOISTURE AVAILABLE FOR CHRISTMAS DAY
...AS SECOND SHARPER UPPER TROUGH CREATES AN INVERTED SURFACE
TROUGH AXIS INTO THE FORECAST AREA...WHILE MAIN SURFACE LOW IS
STILL INDICATED ALONG THE GULF COAST. ECMWF KEEPS SURFACE LOW TO
OUR SOUTH WITHOUT THE INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH FEATURE...SO LESS
MOISTURE THIS FAR NORTH. ECMWF HAS SHORTWAVES MORE IN PHASE AND
LESS AMPLIFIED...AND SEEMS TO BE MODEL CHOSEN BY HPC FOR WINTER
WEATHER OUTLOOK FOR DAY 3 (12Z CHRISTMAS DAY THRU 12Z SUNDAY).

ALL OF THIS...ESPECIALLY FLIP-FLOP OF NAM-GFS FROM RUN TO RUN...
CREATES A GREAT DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY IN HOW MUCH SNOW COULD FALL
ON CHRISTMAS DAY INTO SUNDAY. THE OVERALL TRACK OF THE SURFACE TO
850 MB LOW LOOKS CONSISTENT AND GENERALLY NE UP THE ATLANTIC COAST 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. THIS LENDS CREDENCE TO KEEPING A LIGHT
TO MODERATE AMOUNT OF SNOW FOR THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIANS EAST
INTO WRN NC...NRN GA AND NW SC...AS A GOOD FETCH OF ATLANTIC
MOISTURE FLOWS INTO THESE REGIONS. PLUS SOME PROLONGED SNOW SHOWERS
ON BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM...AS GREAT LAKES MOISTURE AND COLD AIR
FLOW SOUTHWARD.

MINOR FORECAST GRID CHANGES...SUCH AS NUDGING SNOW AMOUNTS UP
ACROSS OUR SW NC COUNTIES AND ALSO JUST A BIT FOR SMOKIES AND NRN
MTNS OF EAST TN. CONSENSUS WAS NO WATCH YET UNTIL MODELS FALL INTO
BETTER AGREEMENT...SO WILL ISSUE OUR SPS AGAIN...AND LET DAY SHIFT
WATCH FOR SOME RUN TO RUN CONSISTENCY FROM MODELS.

THE NORTHERN STREAM AND SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE BEGIN TO PHASE TOGETHER 
OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS PRODUCING LIGHT PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS 
FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY. TEMPERATURE PROFILE SUGGEST 
PRECIPITATION WILL BE ALL SNOW. WILL NOT GET AS AGGRESIVE AS THE ECMWF
FOR SNOWFALL AMOUNTS...BUT WILL CALL FOR A 1 TO 3 INCH SNOW 
ACCUMULATION AREA-WIDE. LATER MODIFICATIONS LIKELY.

SYNOPTIC LIFT MOVES EAST OF THE APPALCHIAN MOUNTAINS LATE SATURDAY 
AS SURFACE LOW STRENGTHENS OFF THE CAROLINA COASTS. AS CLOSED UPPER 
TROUGH AND WEAK-MODERATE NORTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS SUNDAY AND 
CONTINUES THROUGH MONDAY...SNOW ACCUMULATION IS LIKELY OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. ONLY LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS 
ANTICIPATED ACROSS THE VALLEY AND MAINLY ALONG AND NORTH OF 
INTERSTATE 40.

UPPER TROUGH LIFTS OUT FOR MID-WEEK WITH MODERATING TEMPERATURES AND 
DRY CONDITIONS.

AS FOR TEMPERATURES...WILL UNDER-CUT GUIDANCE FOR THE WEEKEND AND 
EARLY NEXT WEEK DUE TO THE SNOW...CLOUD COVER AND COLD AIR ADVECTION.

323 AM EST WED DEC 22 2010

.AVIATION...A SURFACE LOW CENTER WILL MOVE ALONG A COLD FRONT AND 
EXIT THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON...TOWARD THE EAST. THE FRONT WILL 
QUICKLY LEAVE THE REGION BUT COLD AIR WILL STREAM IN BEHIND IT, SO 
THAT TEMPERATURES WILL HAVE A HARD RISING MUCH ABOVE PRESENT VALUES. 
AMPLE MOISTURE, BUT VERY SHALLOW, WILL KEEP LOW CIGS AND VISBY MOST 
OF THE DAY, ALONG WITH OCCASIONAL DRIZZLE OR VERY LIGHT RAIN...WITH 
FLURRIES POSSIBLE IN HIGHER TERRAIN AND NORTH OF TRI.

TYS AND TRI EXPECT TO HAVE PRECIP, BUT CHA FAR LESS LIKELY. VSBYS 
WILL IMPROVE FASTER THAN CIG BUT STILL EXPECT A SLOW IMPROVEMENT 
FROM LIFR TO MVFR. CIGS MAY NOT GO VFR UNTIL WAY AFTER DARK. 

WINDS WILL BE GENERALLY LESS THAN 10 MPH AT TAF SITES, BUT IN 
VICINITY OF MOUNTAINS OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AFTER ABOUT 00Z 
TONIGHT, EXPECT THEM TO BE STEADY FROM THE NORTHWEST ABOVE 20-25 
MPH, WITH GUSTS TO 40 ALONG RIDGETOPS THROUGH ABOUT 12Z THURSDAY.

FOR THE WEEKEND OUTLOOK...SOME UNCERTAINTY STILL ABOUT TRACK OF LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM AND AMOUNT OF MOISTURE, BUT SOME COMPUTER MODELS ARE 
COMING CLOSER TO EACH OTHER ON A SNOWY CHRISTMAS DAY AND SUNDAY. 
STAY TUNED.

323 AM EST WED DEC 22 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE LOW APPROACHING AREA 
THIS MORNING WILL TURN WINDS TO NORTHWEST SOONER THAN LATER WITH 
COLD ADVECTION GOING TO AFFECT THE REGION RIGHT OFF THE BAT. THIS 
WILL MEAN THAT TEMPS WILL STRUGGLE TO RISE ABOUT 5 DEGREES FROM 
PRESENT TO FORECAST HIGH, BUT I THINK THEY CAN DO IT BEFORE THEY 
EITHER GO STEADY OR BEGING DROPPING THE REST OF THE DAY. SHALLOW 
MOISTURE WILL PREVENT MUCH IN THE WAY OF ACCUMULATION OF EITHER RAIN 
OR SNOW. MAIN PRECIPITATION WILL BE EITHER DRIZZLE, VERY LIGHT RAIN 
OR FLURRIES WITH TEMPS DOWN AROUND FREEZING IN THE NORTHERN TWO 
THIRDS OF THE AREA. 

THE MOISTURE KEEPS GETTING SHALLOWER AS THE LOW MOVES OUT TO THE 
EAST AND SO POPS DROP FROM SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH AND LOW CHANCE NORTH 
TO BASICALLY NONE SOUTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE  NORTH BY THURSDAY.

OTHER ISSUE IS STRENGTH OF PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN ABOUT 2500 FEET 
AND 6000 FEET MSL. EXPECT WINDS TO TURN NORTHWEST AND RISE TO ABOVE 
25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO OVER 40 BETWEEN 00Z AND 12Z THURSDAY. WILL 
ISSUE WIND ADVISORY FOR THE NORTHEAST TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS FOR THAT 
TIME PERIOD. AS LOW MOVES EAST, GRADIENT WILL SLACKEN AND WINDS 
SHOULD EASE UP AFTER THAT.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MOST ATTENTION SPENT ON
FINE TUNING FORECAST GRIDS FROM FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT.
MODELS (GEM-GFS-ECMWF-NAM) SEEM IN FAIR AGREEMENT AND WITH SOME
CONTINUITY...ON A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING SE FROM THE MID
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH SURFACE LOW PRESSURE
DEVELOPING ALONG THE GULF COAST REGION. A SOUTHERN TRACK OF THE
SURFACE AND 850 MB LOW...SHOULD KEEP LOW LEVEL TEMPS AND THICKNESSES
VERY FAVORABLE FOR SNOW ON CHRISTMAS DAY. LOW IS PROGGED TO TRACK
ENE INTO THE ATLANTIC SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN TRACK NE JUST OFF THE
MID ATLANTIC COAST ON SUNDAY. THIS WOULD INDICATE PLENTY OF
MOISTURE FROM THE GULF INITIALLY...THEN AN INFLUX OF ATLANTIC
MOISTURE SATURDAY NIGHT...AND A FETCH OF GREAT LAKES MOISTURE INTO
SUNDAY NIGHT.

IF MODELS STAY CONSISTENT WITH THIS TRACK...A WINTER STORM WATCH
MAY BE IN ORDER SHORTLY. HOWEVER...PER COORDINATION WITH NWS
NEIGHBORS...WILL CONTINUE TO HIGHLIGHT THIS POTENTIAL SNOWFALL IN
AN SPS FOR NOW. I DID INCREASE POPS SLIGHTLY FOR CHRISTMAS DAY AND 
ALSO KEPT MAX TEMPS BELOW GFSX MOS FOR BOTH CHRISTMAS DAY AND
SUNDAY. MAX AND MIN TEMPS FOR LATER PERIODS ALSO NUDGED DOWNWARD IN
LINE WITH LATEST MOS GUIDANCE...AND ALSO TO MESH BETTER WITH
ADJACENT GRIDS.

PROFILE INDICATES PRECIPITATION SHOULD BE ALL LIQUID TONIGHT AND 
WEDNESDAY.  MOISTURE IS SHALLOW SO PROBABLY WON'T SEE MUCH RAIN WITH

STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY FOR

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...VERY INTERESTING 
FORECAST FOR THE WEEKEND...AS POTENTIAL EXISTS FOR SIGNIFICANT SNOW 
ACROSS THE AREA.  FIRST...MAY BE SOME LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS OR VERY 
LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN...THEN 
EXPECT DRY CONDITIONS THU AND THU NIGHT.  MODELS STILL DO NOT AGREE 
ON DETAILS OF WEEKEND SYSTEM.  GFS IS FARTHER NORTHWEST AND 
FASTER...BUT HAS TRENDED TOWARD THE MORE CONSENSUS ECMWF
SOLUTION. AT THIS POINT WILL GO WITH A MORE OF BLEND OF THE 00Z
ECMWF/12Z GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN TRACK...BUT CONFIDENCE LOW ON THE
DETAILS OF THIS SYSTEM.  WILL CARRY CHANCE WEST AND SLIGHT CHANCE
ELSEWHERE FRIDAY AFTERNOON...THEN LIKELY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO
SATURDAY. PRECIP TYPE DIFFICULT THIS FAR OUT...BUT AT THIS POINT
LOOKS LIKE PRECIP MAY BEGIN AS RAIN OR A MIX...ESPECIALLY
SOUTH...THEN TRANSITION TO MAINLY SNOW BY SATURDAY MORNING. SHOULD
SEE SNOW SHOWERS LINGERING BEHIND THIS SYSTEM AS COLDER AIR PUSHES
IN FOR SUNDAY AND PERHAPS MONDAY...AND MAY BE MORE SIGNIFICANT SNOW
ACCUMULATIONS ESPECIALLY IN THE NORMALLY FAVORED HIGHER ELEVATION
AREAS. MODEL AGREEMENT POOR FOR TUESDAY SO CONFIDENCE LOW...BUT FOR

..PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...INITIAL BAND OF PRECIPITATION
THAT MOVED SE ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN MAY HAVE BEEN ENHANCED BY
JET DYNAMICS. GOT A FEW REPORTS OF GENERALLY A DUSTING OF NEW SNOW
FROM WISE COUNTY VIRGINIA AND THE TRI CITIES AREA...AS THIS APPEARS
TO BE THE MAIN AREA WHERE PARTIAL THICKNESS AND SURFACE TEMPS
SUPPORT SOMETHING OTHER THAN RAIN.

ISENTROPIC LIFT IS CREATING ANOTHER AREA OF PRECIPITATION (PCPN) TO 
OUR WEST...WHICH HAS REACHED OUR PLATEAU AND LAKEWAY COUNTIES. THIS 
IS VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION GENERALLY IN THE FORM OF SPRINKLES OR 
FLURRIES INITIALLY. FURTHER LIFT/WARMING SHOULD CREATE MOSTLY LIGHT 
RAIN OR DRIZZLE LATER TODAY...AND INTO TONIGHT. THUS...I RAISED POPS 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT CLOSER TO A MOS BLEND...BUT KEPT RAIN AMOUNTS 
ON THE LIGHT SIDE. COLUMN WARMS TOO MUCH AND THE DEPTH OF MOISTURE 
DECREASES TOO MUCH...TO SUPPORT ANY TYPE OF WINTRY PCPN FOR TONIGHT.
REMOVED SNOW FROM GRIDS AND ADJUSTED MIN TEMPS UP CONSIDERABLY IN

FOR TEMPS...NAM MOS LOOKS MUCH TOO COOL FOR HIGHS TODAY...GIVEN FACT 
THAT CURRENT TEMPS WERE ALREADY CLOSE TO FORECASTED HIGHS FROM THE 
NAM. MAY UPDATE OUR SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT...DEPENDING ON HOW 
TEMPS RISE OVER SW VA AND NE TIP OF TN OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...GOING LARGELY WITH GEM 
MODEL AND GEM/GFS IN LATTER PART OF PERIOD. SHALLOW RH WEDNESDAY 
ASSOCIATED WITH EXITING SFC LOW WILL PROVIDE LOW CHANCE POPS 
NORTHEAST TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTHWEST. TEMPS WARM ENOUGH FOR 
RAIN BUT NOT MUCH ON AMOUNTS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY THURSDAY 
DIURNAL TEMP DROP WILL PERMIT SOME LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES IN 
NORTHEAST TN/SOUTHWEST VA. AGAIN, NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNTS.  

SHORT UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH SETTLE IN FOR THURSDAY FOR A 
BREAK IN THE PRECIP. SOME DISAGREEMENT AMONG MODELS AND SURROUNDING 
OFFICES AS TO TIMING OF FOLLOWING SYSTEM FOR FRIDAY. WENT WITH GEM 
WHICH HOLDS SYSTEM BACK AND INTENSIFIES THIS SYSTEM WITH FAIRLY 
TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND DEEPENING SURFACE LOW. HAVE OPTED TO 
USE CHANCE WORDING ON FRIDAY WITH SNOW IN THE MORNING MOSTLY TURNING 
TO RAIN IN THE AFTERNOON. SATURDAY IN THE 00Z TO 06Z TIME FRAME 
GEM/GFS HAVE THIS BODACIOUS SURFACE LOW DEEPENING IN DIXIE AND 
MOVING FAIRLY QUICKLY EAST. THIS PUTS AN INVERTED SFC TROUGH UP INTO 
UPPER TN VALLEY AND BRINGS COLD AIR FROM NORTHEAST INTO AREA. BIG 
STORY IS CHRISTMAS EVE AND DAY WHEN WEAK WARM FRONT CLIPS EASTERN 
SECTIONS WHICH WILL PRODUCE MAINLY RAIN IN THE MOUNTAINS AND 
ADJACENT FOOTHILL/VALLEY AREAS FOR A FEW HOURS. BUT...THICKNESSES 
DROP RAPIDLY BEHIND SFC TROUGH. THE 540 LINE ENTERS THE FORECAST 
AREA AROUND 06Z SATURDAY...AND THE 528 LINE BY 00Z SUNDAY. PLENTY OF 
WRAP AROUND RH WILL ENABLE PRECIP TO TURN TO ALL SNOW PRETTY 
QUICKLY. EVEN THIS FAR AHEAD OF SATURDAY...WENT WITH A BAND OF 
LIKELY POPS FROM WEST TO EAST ON SATURDAY. IT'S POSSIBLE FOR SOME 
ACCUMULATION TO OCCUR CHRISTMAS DAY...BUT THAT IS STILL FOUR DAYS 
FROM NOW. STAY TUNED.

THE SURFACE RAPIDLY DEEPENS AND BOMBS OUT IN THE GFS/GEM AND HEADS UP 
THE EAST COAST ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH SOME LINGERING RH BEHIND IN 
THE NORTHWEST FLOW OF THE ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH. BUT POPS RAPIDLY 
DROP OFF DUE TO SPEED OF EXITING SFC LOW.

TEMPS WERE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN. STARTED WITH GFS TEMPS 
AND THEN ADJUSTED FOR CLOUDS AND PRECIP. MOSTLY JUST MASSAGES TO 
PREVIOUS TEMPS. 

ONE THING TO WATCH AND WILL PASS THIS ON TO SUBSEQUENT SHIFTS IS THE 
CHANCE FOR INCREASING WINDS AS THE SURFACE LOW DEEPENS MID-LATE WEEK.

THAT MOVED SE ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN MAY HAVE BEEN ENHANCED BY
JET DYNAMICS. GOT A FEW REPORTS OF GENERALLY A DUSTING OF NEW SNOW
FROM WISE COUNTY VIRGINIA AND THE TRI CITIES AREA...AS THIS APPEARS
TO BE THE MAIN AREA WHERE PARTIAL THICKNESS AND SURFACE TEMPS
SUPPORT SOMETHING OTHER THAN RAIN.

ISENTROPIC LIFT IS CREATING ANOTHER AREA OF PRECIPITATION (PCPN) TO 
OUR WEST...WHICH HAS REACHED OUR PLATEAU AND LAKEWAY COUNTIES. THIS 
IS VERY LIGHT PRECIPITATION GENERALLY IN THE FORM OF SPRINKLES OR 
FLURRIES INITIALLY. FURTHER LIFT/WARMING SHOULD CREATE MOSTLY LIGHT 
RAIN OR DRIZZLE LATER TODAY...AND INTO TONIGHT. THUS...I RAISED POPS 
FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT CLOSER TO A MOS BLEND...BUT KEPT RAIN AMOUNTS 
ON THE LIGHT SIDE. COLUMN WARMS TOO MUCH AND THE DEPTH OF MOISTURE 
DECREASES TOO MUCH...TO SUPPORT ANY TYPE OF WINTRY PCPN FOR TONIGHT.
REMOVED SNOW FROM GRIDS AND ADJUSTED MIN TEMPS UP CONSIDERABLY IN 
LINE WITH LATEST MOS.

FOR TEMPS...NAM MOS LOOKS MUCH TOO COOL FOR HIGHS TODAY...GIVEN FACT 
THAT CURRENT TEMPS WERE ALREADY CLOSE TO FORECASTED HIGHS FROM THE 
NAM. MAY UPDATE OUR SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT...DEPENDING ON HOW 
TEMPS RISE OVER SW VA AND NE TIP OF TN OVER THE NEXT FEW HOURS. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...GOING LARGELY WITH GEM 
MODEL AND GEM/GFS IN LATTER PART OF PERIOD. SHALLOW RH WEDNESDAY 
ASSOCIATED WITH EXITING SFC LOW WILL PROVIDE LOW CHANCE POPS 
NORTHEAST TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTHWEST. TEMPS WARM ENOUGH FOR 
RAIN BUT NOT MUCH ON AMOUNTS. WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY THURSDAY 
DIURNAL TEMP DROP WILL PERMIT SOME LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES IN 
NORTHEAST TN/SOUTHWEST VA. AGAIN, NEGLIGIBLE AMOUNTS.  

SHORT UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH SETTLE IN FOR THURSDAY FOR A 
BREAK IN THE PRECIP. SOME DISAGREEMENT AMONG MODELS AND SURROUNDING 
OFFICES AS TO TIMING OF FOLLOWING SYSTEM FOR FRIDAY. WENT WITH GEM 
WHICH HOLDS SYSTEM BACK AND INTENSIFIES THIS SYSTEM WITH FAIRLY 
TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENTS AND DEEPENING SURFACE LOW. HAVE OPTED TO 
USE CHANCE WORDING ON FRIDAY WITH SNOW IN THE MORNING MOSTLY TURNING 
TO RAIN IN THE AFTERNOON. SATURDAY IN THE 00Z TO 06Z TIME FRAME 
GEM/GFS HAVE THIS BODACIOUS SURFACE LOW DEEPENING IN DIXIE AND 
MOVING FAIRLY QUICKLY EAST. THIS PUTS AN INVERTED SFC TROUGH UP INTO 
UPPER TN VALLEY AND BRINGS COLD AIR FROM NORTHEAST INTO AREA. BIG 
STORY IS CHRISTMAS EVE AND DAY WHEN WEAK WARM FRONT CLIPS EASTERN 
SECTIONS WHICH WILL PRODUCE MAINLY RAIN IN THE MOUNTAINS AND 
ADJACENT FOOTHILL/VALLEY AREAS FOR A FEW HOURS. BUT...THICKNESSES 
DROP RAPIDLY BEHIND SFC TROUGH. THE 540 LINE ENTERS THE FORECAST 
AREA AROUND 06Z SATURDAY...AND THE 528 LINE BY 00Z SUNDAY. PLENTY OF 
WRAP AROUND RH WILL ENABLE PRECIP TO TURN TO ALL SNOW PRETTY 
QUICKLY. EVEN THIS FAR AHEAD OF SATURDAY...WENT WITH A BAND OF 
LIKELY POPS FROM WEST TO EAST ON SATURDAY. IT'S POSSIBLE FOR SOME 
ACCUMULATION TO OCCUR CHRISTMAS DAY...BUT THAT IS STILL FOUR DAYS 
FROM NOW. STAY TUNED.

THE SURFACE RAPIDLY DEEPENS AND BOMBS OUT IN THE GFS/GEM AND HEADS UP 
THE EAST COAST ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY WITH SOME LINGERING RH BEHIND IN 
THE NORTHWEST FLOW OF THE ASSOCIATED UPPER TROUGH. BUT POPS RAPIDLY 
DROP OFF DUE TO SPEED OF EXITING SFC LOW.

TEMPS WERE A LITTLE DIFFICULT TO PIN DOWN. STARTED WITH GFS TEMPS 
AND THEN ADJUSTED FOR CLOUDS AND PRECIP. MOSTLY JUST MASSAGES TO 
PREVIOUS TEMPS. 

ONE THING TO WATCH AND WILL PASS THIS ON TO SUBSEQUENT SHIFTS IS THE 
CHANCE FOR INCREASING WINDS AS THE SURFACE LOW DEEPENS MID-LATE WEEK.

.AVIATION...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE ANCHORED OVER OHIO AND WV TONIGHT AND
TOMORROW...EXTENDING SOUTH INTO THE TN VALLEY. ADVECTION OF WARM
MOIST AIR ABOVE THE SURFACE WILL LEAD TO INCREASING CLOUDS LATE
TONIGHT...WHICH WILL LOWER TO MVFR AT ALL TAF SITES TOMORROW
MORNING. THE MOISTURE REMAINS RELATIVELY SHALLOW...AND WITH LIFT
BEING WEAK...ANY PRECIP IS EXPECTED TO BE VERY LIGHT TOMORROW. WILL
MENTION AS DRIZZLE IN THE TAFS. IF PRECIP MOVES IN EARLIER THAN
FORECAST WHEN TEMPS ARE STILL BELOW FREEZING...THERE COULD BE SOME
LIGHT ICE ACCUMULATING AT TRI AND TYS...ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE IS TOO
LOW TO MENTION IN THE TAF FOR NOW. CEILINGS MAY APPROACH IFR LEVELS
LATE IN THE TAF PERIOD AT ALL SITES.

ON THE TAIL END OF A COLD FRONT WITH WEAK NORTHWEST FLOW AND LIMITED 
MOISTURE BY THE TIME WEDNESDAY FINISHES UP. SHORT UPPER RIDGE AND 
SURFACE HIGH SETTLE IN FOR THURSDAY FOR A BREAK IN THE PRECIP. SOME 
DISAGREEMENT AMONG MODELS AND SURROUNDING OFFICES AS TO TIMING OF

POTENTIALLY DEEPENS AND SLOWS. PLUS...THIS IS MONDAY AND FRIDAY, 
SATURDAY, AND SUNDAY ARE A LONG WAY OFF. THERE IS AN OUTSIDE CHANCE 
FOR A BRIEFLY WHITE CHRISTMAS IN THE MORNING BEFORE IT WARMS UP 
ENOUGH TO TURN TO RAIN. WE'LL KEEP AN EYE ON THIS.

THERE WILL BE A BRIEF BREAK IN PRECIPITATION AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE OVERRIDDEN 
BY WARMER AIR FROM WEST-SOUTHWEST IS PRODUCING PATCHY LIGHT FREEZING 
DRIZZLE AND SNOW OVER PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. RADAR SHOWS 
MODERATELY STRONG ECHOES BUT EVEN WHEN MOVING DIRECTLY OVER 
OBSERVING SITES, LITTLE TO NO PRECIP IS REPORTED. SOME PASSED 
DIRECTLY OVER WFO AND DID PRODUCE INTERMITTENT FREEZING RAIN AND A 
DUSTING OF SNOW, WHICH IS RAPIDLY MELTING. THIS SITUATION WILL 
CONTINUE UNTIL SURFACE TEMPS WARM TO ABOVE FREEZING ABOUT MID 
MORNING. HAVE THEREFORE UPDATED FORECAST AND CARRIED THIS INTO THE 
MID MORNING ON CURRENT PACKAGE. WILL HANDLE THIS WITH SHORT TERM 
FORECASTS. DO NOT BELIEVE THE VERY SPOTTY NATURE OF THE 
FREEZING/FROZEN PRECIP WARRANTS A SPECIAL STATEMENT AT THIS TIME. 
WILL, HOWEVER, MONITOR CONDITIONS AND PASS THIS THINKING ON TO DAY 
SHIFT. 

AFTER THE WARMING, HAVE LEFT IN A CHANCE FOR LIGHT RAIN 
THROUGH AFTERNOON WITH A TAPERING OFF INTO EVENING AND THEN 
VIRTUALLY ELIMINATED POPS OVERNIGHT INTO SUNDAY MORNING. 

LOWERED MAX TEMPS TODAY BECAUSE OF CLOUD COVER RESULTING IN SLOW 
WARMING. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CLEAR
SKIES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY BUT WITH UPPER TROUGH PASSING
THROUGH TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN COOL FROM A START IN THE 20S.
HIGHS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 30S TO MID 40S. SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY
SKIES WILL BE PARTLY CLOUDY AS SHORTWAVE ENERGY PASSES ACROSS THE
OHIO VALLEY. LOWS SUNDAY NIGHT AGAIN SIMILAR TO SATURDAY NIGHT.
MONDAY RIDGING AND THE MOVEMENT OF HIGH PRESSURE TO THE EAST COAST
WILL WARM HIGHS SEVERAL DEGREES. NEW LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES INTO
THE MS VALLEY MONDAY NIGHT AND ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TUESDAY. PRECIPITATION WILL BEGIN LATE MONDAY
NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM WILL BE MOSTLY RAIN TUESDAY BUT SOME SNOW
POSSIBLE MONDAY NIGHT NORTHERN SECTIONS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS.
TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SYSTEM MORE
HIGH ELEVATION SNOW POSSIBLE. HIGH PRESSURE AND RIDGING ALOFT WILL
WARM MOST AREAS THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. A STRONGER SYSTEM WILL
DEVELOP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND MS VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT AND
SPREAD INTO THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY. THIS SYSTEM AGAIN LOOKS WARM
ENOUGH FOR MOSTLY RAIN BUT WILL DRAG IN COLDER AIR BY SATURDAY SO
THE RAIN WILL LIKELY CHANGE TO SNOW IN THE NORTH AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

AND TYS EARLY IN THE PERIOD.  THIS IS EXPECTED TO BRIEFLY IMPROVE A 
BIT BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z...BEFORE LOW CLOUDS AND POSSIBLY SOME 
DECREASE IN VISIBILITY RETURN BEFORE SUNRISE.  THINGS SHOULD IMPROVE 
TO VFR DURING THE MORNING.  HOWEVER...A WEATHER DISTURBANCE TRACKING 
TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST WILL ONCE AGAIN INCREASE AND LOWER CLOUDS AND 
MAY GENERATE SOME LIGHT PRECIP BETWEEN 18Z AND 00Z.  WINDS WILL

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...ALMOST ZONAL FLOW ACROSS AREA. 
SURFACE HIGH CREEPING IN FROM WEST. IN THE SOUTHERN EDGE OF THE 
SURFACE HIGH APPEARS A WEAK LITTLE TROF WHICH WILL CREEP THROUGH THE 
AREA DURING THE NIGHT TONIGHT AND THEN OUT BEFORE SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON. WITH HIGH RH VALUES ACROSS AREA DUE TO COLD TEMPS THIS 
WILL EKE OUT LOW POPS FOR THE SOUTHEASTERN PORTIONS OF FORECAST AREA 
AND THE MOUNTAINS UP TO ABOUT GREEN COUNTY. BEST POPS WILL BE IN 
SOUTH IN POLK, MONROE, CHEROKEE AND CLAY, BUT EVEN THEN NOT OUT OF 
THE 30S. ADJACENT FOOTHILLS WILL HAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF PRECIP AND 
THEN VALLEY LOCATIONS NOT MUCH AT ALL. PRECIP MAY BE FLURRIES  OR A 
MIX IN THE WEE HOURS TONIGHT AND THEN SWITCH OVER TO SPRINKLES/LIGHT 
RAIN BY AFTERNOON BEFORE DEPARTING AS UPPER LEVEL WEAK SHORT WAVES 
MOVES EAST. 

ADJUSTED TEMPS UP A LITTLE ON MINS WITH CLOUD COVER NOT MOVING MUCH. 
LEFT MAXES LARGELY AS IS SATURDAY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SHORTWAVE TRACKING 
THROUGH THE AREA ON SATURDAY NIGHT. WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE 
EXPECTED...WILL KEEP ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY EVENING. 
HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. A 
FRONT ENTERS THE REGION ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. MODELS FAIRLY 
AGREEABLE ON TIMING. BASED ON TEMPERATURES...IT SHOULD BEGIN AS RAIN 
ON MONDAY NIGHT THEN SWITCH TO SNOW WITH SNOW CONTINUING INTO 
TUESDAY MORNING. IT THEN SHOULD SWITCH BACK TO RAIN BY TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON. UPPER LOW LINGERS INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. 
DEEPEST MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH...SO KEEP HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN ZONES. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS PROVIDING DRY 
WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. A FRONT IS EXPECTED TO 
ENTER THE REGION ON FRIDAY. WITH STILL UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING...WILL 
ADD ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY. IT SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR 
RAIN. WITH COLD AIR LINGERING...MEX GUIDANCE APPEARED ON THE WARM 
SIDE FOR THE PERIOD...SO GENERALLY STAYED BELOW GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES AND FOLLOWED NEAR HPC FOR TEMPERATURES.

1240 PM EST FRI DEC 17 2010

.AVIATION...MODELS NOT HANDLING THE CLOUD SHIELD OVER AREA VERY 
WELL, SO A LITTLE SHOOTING FROM THE HIP HERE WITH CIGS. HAVE MORE 
CONFIDENCE IN WINDS AND VISIBILITY. NEXT SYSTEM IS OVER THE CENTRAL 
US AND NOT EXPECTED TO AFFECT THIS FORECAST PERIOD...EXCEPT FOR 
PUMPING CLOUDS INTO THE AREA.

SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE SETTLING OVER AREA AND THIS WILL KEEP TEMPS 
COLD-ISH WHICH MEANS HIGHER HUMIDITIES AND BETTER CHANCE TO KEEP 
CLOUDS IN PLACE. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE PRETTY SHALLOW, BUT THE 
TEMPERATURE INVERSION OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL KEEP IT TRAPPED 
AND TEND TO KEEP MVFR CEILINGS LONGER TODAY.

A DRY LAYER ABOVE THAT WILL LIKELY PROVIDE A SPACE ABOVE THE CIGS, 
BUT THEN MIDDLE AND HIGH CLOUDS STREAMING INTO AREA FROM SOUTHWEST 
ABOVE THE DRY LAYER. 

FOR CHA, SOME CLEARING IS EVIDENT FROM THE SOUTH AS AS LOW CLOUDS 
DISSIPATE. HAVE OPTED TO GO VFR THERE EARLIER.

FOR TYS AND TRI, DIFFERENT STORY WITH LOW CLOUDS NOT APPEARING TO 
MAKE ANY PROGRESS AWAY. WILL KEEP LOWER CIGS IN THERE UNTIL AFTER 
00Z BUT EVEN THEN NOT VERY CONFIDENT THAT THEY WILL ACTUALLY GO 
AWAY. 

TEMPERATURES AT TAF SITES WILL DROP BELOW FREEZING AGAIN AFTER ABOUT 
00Z, TOO.

NORTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN-CENTRAL VALLEY. TEMPERATURES AT TYS 
ARE IN THE 50S WHILE MORRISTOWN REMAINS NEAR 40 AND TRI IN THE LOWER 
AND MID 30S. WARMER AIR WILL CONTINUE TO PULL NORTH THROUG THIS 
EVENING UNTIL COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. AREA OF RAIN AND
FREEZING WILL PULL EAST THIS EVENING...BUT FREEZING DRIZZLE WILL
REMAIN. NORTHWEST ORGOGRAPHIC LIFT WILL PRODUCE SHOWERS OVER THE

SINCE THE BOUNDARY LAYER MOISTURE WILL BE QUITE SHALLOW AND WARMER 
THAN THE DENDRITIC SNOW GROWTH (WARMER THAN -8)...WILL CALL FOR A 
MIXTURE OF FREEZING RAIN-FREEZING DRIZZLE-RAIN FOR MAINLY THE 
UPSLOPE LOCATIONS. HAVE ISSUED A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THROUGH 09Z FRIDAY.

AREAS OF FOG...SOME LOCALLY DENSE...CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED OVERNIGHT.

SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY AND SATURDAY EVENING. HIGH PRESSURE 
RETURNS PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY. A FRONT ENTERS

.AVIATION...WARM FRONT IS STRETCHED SOUTHEAST ACROSS WEST TN AND 
NORTHERN AL. A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN WILL CONTINUE 
OVERNIGHT...WITH A FEW MORE HOURS OF FREEZING RAIN EXPECTED AT KCHA 
AND KTYS. A PERIOD OF LIGHT SNOW IS EXPECTED INITIALLY AT 
KTRI...BEFORE CHANGING OVER TO FREEZING RAIN BEFORE SUNRISE. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT PRECIP SHOULD GRADUALLY CHANGE TO RAIN BEFORE SUNRISE 
AT KCHA...AROUND SUNRISE AT KTYS...AND AFTER SUNRISE AT KTRI. AS 
THIS WARM FRONT APPROACHES THE REGION THIS MORNING... VISIBILITIES 
AND CEILINGS SHOULD LOWER INTO THE IFR RANGES...AND WILL LIKELY 
REMAIN LOW THROUGH THE DAY ON THURSDAY AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
MOVES OVER THE TAF SITES. A COLD FRONT WILL THEN MOVE THROUGH THE 
REGION TOWARDS SUNSET ON THURSDAY...WITH WINDS SHIFTING TO THE WEST 
AND CEILINGS AND VISIBILITIES FINALLY RISING.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED WARM FRONT STRETCHING 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS NORTHERN MS AND CENTRAL AL. RECENT REPORTS FROM THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA (GENERALLY SOUTH OF KNOXVILLE) 
HAVE INDICATED A BRIEF PERIOD OF SNOW BEFORE CHANGING QUICKLY OVER 
TO FREEZING RAIN. WHILE IT APPEARS THAT THE WARM 850 MB LAYER IS 
QUICKLY PROGRESSING OVER THE FORECAST AREA...VERY DRY AIR IN THE 
LOWER LEVELS (AS EVIDENCED BY THE LOW DEWPOINTS IN THE TEENS) WILL 
CONTINUE TO CREATE SOME STRONG EVAPORATIVE COOLING THIS EVENING. 
THUS...EXPECT WINTRY PRECIP (MAINLY IN THE FORM OF FREEZING RAIN) TO 
CONTINUE FOR SEVERAL HOURS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. GFS AND NAM MODELS AGREE THAT A COLDER...SUB-FREEZING AIR MASS 
IS DEEPER ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHERE 
PRECIP WILL LIKELY REMAIN AS SNOW FOR A LONGER PERIOD BEFORE 
GRADUALLY TRANSITIONING OVER TO FREEZING RAIN AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
ALSO...MODELS AGREE THAT PRECIP WILL FURTHER INTENSIFY OVER THE 
WARNING AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT...WITH SIGNIFICANT ICE ACCUMS STILL 
APPEARING LIKELY ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...NORTHEAST

DATA THAT THE CHANGEOVER TO ALL RAIN SHOULD OCCUR AFTER MIDNIGHT 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...TOWARDS SUNRISE ACROSS 
CENTRAL EAST TN...AND AROUND LATE MORNING AFTER SUNRISE ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN PLATEAU...NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SKIES CLEARED THIS MORNING AS 
UPPER LOW AND ASSOCIATED MOISTURE FROM THE GREAT LAKES SHIFTED EAST. 
WINDS HAVE ALSO DECREASED TO 5 TO 10 MPH LOWER ELEVATIONS WITH 
NORTHERN SECTIONS AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS AROUND 10 MPH WITH SOME 
HIGHER GUSTS. TEMPERATURES WERE SLOW TO RISE BUT REACHED A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER NE SECTIONS DUE TO MORE SUN AND ARE NOW MIDDLE TEENS 
TO UPPER 20S. ONE MORE CLEAR AND VERY COLD NIGHT TONIGHT ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND EASTERN TN VALLEY AS DRY COLD 
AIRMASS...LIGHTER WINDS AND SNOW COVER MAKES FOR IDEAL RADIATIONAL 
COOLING. DEW POINTS HAVE BEEN IN THE SINGLE DIGITS TODAY. 
FORECASTING A RECORD TYING 9 DEGREE LOW AT TRI CITIES WHICH MIGHT 
EVEN BE TO WARM WITH THE LOW DEW POINTS. ELSEWHERE SINGLE DIGITS AND 
TEENS. WEDNESDAY A DEVELOPING SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN ROCKIES MOVES 
INTO THE PLAINS WITH A WARM MOIST AIRMASS ADVANCING FROM THE WEST 
SOUTHWEST. MODELS ARE NOW A LITTLE SLOWER THAN BEFORE AND DO NOT 
EXPECT AND PRECIPITATION TO SPREAD INTO SW AND WEST SECTIONS UNTIL 
AFTERNOON. WARM AIR ALOFT WILL SPREAD IN RAPIDLY WEDNESDAY BUT 
TEMPERATURES AT THE SURFACE WILL WARM MORE SLOWLY ONLY REACHING THE 
UPPER 20S TO UPPER 30S FROM A COLD START AND GRADUALLY INCREASING 
CLOUDS. A MIXTURE OF SNOW AND SLEET WILL START IN THE WESTERN 
SECTIONS AND POSSIBLY FREEZING RAIN OR RAIN IN THE AFTERNOON. ONLY 
SLIGHT ACCUMULATIONS OF A HUNDREDTH OR TWO OF PRECIPITATION ARE 
EXPECTED SO NOT LIKELY TO AFFECT TRAVEL SIGNIFICANTLY AS BULK OF 
SYSTEM MOVES IN WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT 
THEN DIVERGE FOR THE WEEKEND. A WARM FRONT...ASSOCIATED WITH A LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS...IS PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...WITH A STRONG WARM AIR 
ADVECTION PATTERN DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. GFS MODEL IS A 
LITTLE WARMER THAN THE NAM MODEL ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT THE 
VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILES OF BOTH MODELS INDICATE THAT LIGHT SNOW 
SHOULD DEVELOP INITIALLY OVER THE AREA BY EARLY WEDNESDAY EVENING. A 
STRONG AND WARM 850 MB LAYER WILL THEN PUSH NORTHWARD ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA...CAUSING THIS SNOW TO CHANGE OVER TO SLEET AND 
FREEZING RAIN...BEFORE ULTIMATELY BECOMING ALL RAIN BY THURSDAY. IT 
APPEARS THAT THE CHANGEOVER TO ALL RAIN SHOULD OCCUR AROUND MIDNIGHT 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...AROUND SUNRISE THURSDAY 
MORNING ACROSS CENTRAL EAST TN...AND AROUND LATE MORNING ACROSS 
NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. THE RECENT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS MAY 
SLOW THE STRONG WARMING THAT IS PROGGED BY THE MODELS (ESPECIALLY IN 
THE PROTECTED VALLEY AREAS)...BUT THE MODELS AGREE THAT THE MORE 
NORTHERLY TRACK OF THE LOW (ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND SOUTHERN WV ON 
THURSDAY MORNING) SHOULD BRING ALL AREAS ABOVE FREEZING ON THURSDAY. 
RIGHT NOW...IT APPEARS THAT SOME ICE ACCUMS OF 0.10-0.20 INCHES WILL 
BE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST 
AREA...SO WILL CONTINUE THE SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT IN THESE 
AREAS. MODELS NOW INDICATE QPF AMOUNTS AROUND 0.25 INCH OR GREATER 
ALONG THE TN/KY BORDER AND SOUTHWEST VA BY 12Z THURSDAY...SO WILL 
ISSUE A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR THESE AREAS WHERE 0.25 INCH OF ICE 
ACCUMS (AS WELL AS 1 TO 3 INCHES OF SNOW) WILL BE POSSIBLE. 

A WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL THEN MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...SO WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SOME RAIN/SNOW DURING THESE PERIODS. BY THE WEEKEND...THE LATEST GFS 
MODEL RUN CONTINUES TO INDICATE THE DEVELOPMENT OF A STRONG PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OFF THE CAROLINA COAST ON SATURDAY...WHICH WOULD SPREAD 
MOISTURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA IN THE FORM OF SNOW OR RAIN. ECMWF 
MODEL CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT THIS LOW WILL FORM FURTHER EAST OVER 
THE ATLANTIC OCEAN...WITH GENERALLY DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS FOR 
THE FORECAST AREA. ALTHOUGH THE ECMWF MODEL HAS BEEN MORE CONSISTENT 
(AND USUALLY VERIFIES BETTER)...WILL LEAN TOWARDS THE GFS MODEL 
SINCE ITS SOLUTION APPEARS TO BE WHAT NORMALLY HAPPENS THIS TIME OF 
YEAR.

320 PM EST MON DEC 13 2010

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...WINTER STORM WINDING DOWN ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA AS DEEPER MOISTURE SHIFTS EAST WITH UPPER 
LOW NOW ALONG THE NE COASTAL STATES. NORTHWEST WINDS WILL CONTINUE 
STRONG ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND CONTINUE SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY 
OVERNIGHT TONIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY MORNING. HAVE CANCELLED THE 
WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR SOUTHEAST TN AND NC MOUNTAINS...NORTHERN 
PLATEAU AND MUCH OF THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF EAST TN AS SKIES HAVE 
BEGUN TO BREAKOUT EXCEPT THE FOOTHILLS OF THE SMOKIES WHERE RADAR 
INDICATES SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUING AND ALSO ACROSS NE TN VALLEYS. 
ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS IN THE ADVISORY AREAS WILL BE LIGHT. 
HOWEVER IN THE MOUNTAINS ANOTHER COUPLE INCHES ARE POSSIBLE 
OVERNIGHT SO KEPT WINTER STORM WARNING IN EFFECT UNTIL 1 AM. AS 
SKIES SLOWLY CLEAR AND WITH SNOW COVER LOWS TONIGHT ARE EXPECTED TO 
DROP TO 5 TO 15 DEGREES. AS HIGH PRESSURE TAKES CONTROL TUESDAY 
SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS AND NE BUT 
GRADUALLY CLEAR THERE DURING THE DAY. WENT ON LOW SIDE OF GUIDANCE 
FOR HIGHS IN THE MIDDLE TEENS TO UPPER 20S. WINDS WILL GRADUALLY 
DECREASE TONIGHT EXCEPT REMAIN STRONG FROM THE NORTHWEST IN THE 
HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS WHERE WIND CHILL ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT UNTIL 
11 AM TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH FRIDAY...BUT THEN 
DIVERGE FOR THE WEEKEND. A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP 
OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON WEDNESDAY...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED WARM 
FRONT MOVING NORTH ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL 
INCREASE OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT... 
AS THIS LOW MOVES EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. GFS AND NAM 
MODELS BOTH AGREE THAT THIS LOW WILL MOVE A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH... 
WITH A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN DEVELOPING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...THE COLD AIR AT THE SURFACE 
WILL BE SLOW TO RETREAT...SO A WINTRY MIX OF SNOW...SLEET AND 
FREEZING RAIN APPEARS LIKELY BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ALTHOUGH THE RECENT 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS MAY SLOW THE STRONG WARMING THAT IS PROGGED BY 
THE MODELS...IT APPEARS THAT PRECIP SHOULD BE IN THE FORM OF RAIN 
AREA WIDE BY THURSDAY. RIGHT NOW...IT APPEARS THAT SOME ICE ACCUMS 
OF 0.10-0.20 INCHES WILL BE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY NIGHT...ALONG WITH 
SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMS OF 1 TO 2 INCHES. MODELS THEN INDICATE THAT A 
WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...SO WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SOME 
RAIN/SNOW DURING THESE PERIODS. BY THE WEEKEND...ECMWF MODEL 
INDICATES THAT A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST WILL 
DEVELOP A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH 
GENERALLY DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. LATEST 
GFS MODEL RUN HAS COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE ECMWF MODEL... 
BUT EARLIER GFS RUNS HAD INDICATE THAT THIS LOW WOULD DEVELOP CLOSER 
TO THE EAST COAST...WITH SOME WINTRY PRECIP AFFECTING THE FORECAST 
AREA FOR THE WEEKEND. FOR NOW...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE ECMWF 
SOLUTION WITH DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS FOR SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY...BUT THIS COULD EASILY CHANGE IN LATER FORECASTS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WITH TROUGH SHIFTING OUT OF THE 
AREA...WILL BE TRANSITIONING TO MORE OF A PURE UPSLOPE EVENT. 
MOISTURE WILL GRADUALLY BECOME MORE SHALLOW...BUT STILL LOOKS LIKE 
ENOUGH MOISTURE ALONG WITH STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES TO SUPPORT 
CURRENT ADVISORIES/WARNINGS...SO NO CHANGES PLANNED THERE.  SNOW 
SHOWERS SHOULD BE DIMINISHING QUITE A BIT BY LATE TONIGHT...SO 06Z 
STOP TIME LOOKS REASONABLE FOR THE WARNING.  MAY BE BORDERLINE FOR A 
WIND ADVISORY IN SOME OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN TODAY...BUT WILL 
CONTINUE TO JUST MENTION WINDS IN THE OTHER PRODUCTS.  WIND CHILLS 
WILL ALSO BE QUITE LOW...AND CURRENT WIND CHILL ADVISORY ALSO LOOKS 
GOOD.  OVERALL NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW OROGRAPHIC 
SNOWFALL SHOULD CONTINUE OVER THE TERRAIN FEATURES ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE ON TUESDAY BEFORE ENDING LATER IN 
THE DAY. LITTLE REST FOR THE WEARY BEHIND THE EARLY WEEK SNOWSTORM 
AS MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW TROFINESS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE CENTER 
PORTION OF THE NATION ON WEDNESDAY WITH SURFACE SYSTEM DEVELOPING IN 
THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES. THIS SETS THE STAGE FOR A MID WEEK STORM 
SYSTEM THAT PROMISES TO BRING A PERIOD OF MIXED PRECIPITATION AS THE 
SURFACE LOW SHIFTS EAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. 
ATMOSPHERIC STRUCTURE STILL COLD ENOUGH FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LIGHT 
SNOW ON WEDNESDAY AS MOISTURE SPREADS IN ALOFT. WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
929 PM EST SUN DEC 12 2010

.DISCUSSION...LOW PRESSURE BRINGING SNOW...WIND AND COLD TEMPERATURES 
TO THE CWA. CURRENT WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES STILL LOOK REASONABLE. 
TEMPERATURES AND THE THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. WILL UPDATE 
ZONES TO REMOVE EVENING WORDING. NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...
THE CENTER OF THE 500 MB CIRCULATION WILL BE PASSING OVER THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE AREA BETWEEN 21Z AND 06Z. SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE 
INCREASING DURING THIS WINDOW. AFTER 06Z...850 MB WINDS INCREASE TO 
AROUND 40 KTS AND TURN TO NW...AND IDEAL SETUP FOR UPSLOPE 
ENHANCEMENT OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. VERY COLD 
TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL GENERATE STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES THIS 
EVENING THROUGH MONDAY...WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE IN THE DENDRITE 
GROWTH ZONE FROM A GREAT LAKES CONNECTION. THE GOOD INSTABILITY AND 
DEEP MOISTURE WILL MEAN THAT VALLEY LOCATIONS WILL SEE ACCUMULATING 
SNOW AS WELL. 

NOT MUCH HAS CHANGED FROM THE PREVIOUS FORECAST REASONING...AND FEW 
CHANGES WILL BE NEEDED. SLIGHT UPWARD ADJUSTMENTS TO SNOWFALL 
AMOUNTS WILL BE MADE BASED ON TRENDS OF RADAR AND UPSTREAM 
OBSERVATIONS...BUT ACCUMULATIONS WILL STILL BE WITHIN THE PREVIOUSLY 
FORECAST RANGES. WARMING MIDLEVEL TEMPS MONDAY NIGHT SHOULD BRING AN 
END TO SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATIONS...SO WSW END TIMES LOOK GOOD. 

ONE ADDITION TO THE WSW PRODUCT WILL BE A WIND CHILL ADVISORY. 
EXPECTED WIND CHILL VALUES IN THE TN MOUNTAINS WILL BE EASILY WITHIN 
ADVISORY CRITERIA OF -5 TO -14 DEGREES FROM 00Z MONDAY TO 16Z 
TUESDAY...WITH THE HIGHEST PEAKS EVEN LOWER. THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
SW VA WILL ALSO SEE WIND CHILLS IN THIS RANGE...BEGINNING 09Z 
TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. WIND SPEEDS IN THE MOUNTAINS WILL 
BE MAINLY 20 TO 25 MPH WITH GUSTS TO 40 MPH...WHICH IS CLOSE TO WIND 
ADVISORY CRITERIA...BUT SPEEDS ABOVE THAT RANGE SEEM ISOLATED AND 
BRIEF ENOUGH NOT TO ISSUE ONE AT THIS TIME.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...
DID NOT CHANGE LOW CHANCES FOR OROGRAPHIC SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS  
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER TUESDAY AS NW FLOW OFF THE GREAT LAKES WINDS DOWN. 
TEMPERATURES REMAIN FRIGID WITH EXPECTED SNOW COVER AND ESPECIALLY 
WITH WIND CONTINUING. PRESSURE GRADIENT DECREASES LATER IN THE DAY 
SO WINDS WILL DROP OFF. ANOTHER VERY COLD NIGHT TUESDAY NIGHT WITH 
MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND SNOW COVER. PLACES IN THE NE WILL LIKELY BE A 
FEW DEGREES COLDER. WEDNESDAY PATTERN BECOMES MORE ZONAL AS TROUGH 
EXITS THE NE STATES. A DEVELOPING SYSTEM ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
WILL BRING MOISTURE BACK OVER THE COLD AIRMASS WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
AND NIGHT BRINGING A MIXTURE OF PRECIPITATION TYPES WITH FREEZING 
RAIN POSSIBLE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
NORTHERN SECTIONS WILL LIKELY SEE SNOW AND SLEET WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
CHANGING TO FREEZING RAIN AND RAIN THURSDAY. HIGHS WEDNESDAY SHOULD 
REACH THE MID 30S TO NEAR 40 SOUTH AND MID 20S TO LOWER 30S NORTH. 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT TEMPERATURES WILL BE STEADY OR SLOWLY RISE. THURSDAY 
SHOULD BE SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER IN THE UPPER 30S TO UPPER 40S. AS 
LOW PRESSURE SHIFTS EAST WITH THURSDAY SYSTEM AND TROUGH DEVELOPS 
AGAIN ACROSS THE EAST THE RAIN SHOULD CHANGE BACK TO SNOW ACROSS 
NORTHERN SECTIONS THURSDAY NIGHT OR FRIDAY. PRECIPITATION ENDS WITH 
COLDER TEMPERATURES FOR THE WEEKEND. BUT TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER 
THAN BEHIND THIS EARLY WEEK COLD BLAST.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
302 PM EST SAT DEC 11 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...
A DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER IA WILL BRING SIGNIFICANT 
SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS TO PORTIONS OF THE AREA LATE TONIGHT THROUGH 
MONDAY NIGHT. RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD THE AREA THROUGH THE 
EVENING...ASSOCIATED WITH STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE EXIT REGION 
OF A JET STREAK AT THE BASE OF THE CLOSED UPPER LOW. WARM ADVECTION 
AHEAD OF THE ADVANCING COLD FRONT SHOULD KEEP TEMPERATURES IN THE 
MOUNTAINS ABOVE FREEZING...OFFSETTING EVAPORATIVE COOLING BY PRECIP 
INTO DRY AIR. 

THE QUESTION IS WHETHER PRECIP WILL CHANGE TO SNOW BEFORE THE DEEP 
MOISTURE AND STRONG FORCING EXIT. WHILE THE MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT OVERALL...THEIR SOUNDINGS DIFFER IN THE TEMPERATURE 
PROFILE BELOW 800 MB...WITH THE GFS BEING NEAR-FREEZING 
ISOTHERMAL...AND THE NAM SHOWING A MORE DISTINCT 3C WARM NOSE. LEAN 
MORE TOWARD THE NAM GIVEN THE STRONG S-SW FLOW AHEAD OF THE 
FRONT...BUT IF THE GFS IS CORRECT...SNOW AMOUNTS TONIGHT COULD BE 
HIGHER. TEMPS ALOFT DROP SHARPLY WITH FROPA SUNDAY MORNING...GOING 
BELOW FREEZING FIRST IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AROUND 10Z...THEN IN 
THE VALLEY AROUND 15Z. HOWEVER THE DRY SLOT CUTS OFF DEEP MOISTURE 
SUNDAY MORNING...SO THERE WILL LIKELY BE A LULL IN THE PRECIP ONCE 
THE COLD AIR MOVES IN. THERE COULD BE A COUPLE INCHES OF 
ACCUMULATION IN THE MTNS TONIGHT/SUNDAY MORNING...WITH A DUSTING IN 
THE PLATEAU AND SW VA. ANY SNOW WILL LIKELY BE VERY WET...WITH A LOW 
LIQUID/SNOW RATIO.

AS THE DEEP 500 MB CLOSED LOW TRACKS ACROSS KY AND INTO WV 
SUNDAY...THE EVENT WILL TRANSITION TO A NW FLOW SNOW EVENT. STEEP 
LAPSE RATES UNDER THE LOW WILL GENERATE SNOW SHOWERS SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. NEAR-SATURATION IN THE DENDRITE GROWTH ZONE 
AND STRENGTHENING NW WINDS WILL MEAN IDEAL CONDITIONS FOR 
SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN...AND PERSISTENT SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE VALLEY. WINDS IN THE 900-850 MB LAYER REMAIN BETWEEN 
25-35 KTS FROM THE NW SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. VERY HIGH 
LIQUID/SNOW RATIOS ARE LIKELY IN THE MOUNTAINS WITH THESE 
CONDITIONS. BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW WILL BE LIKELY...AND WIND 
ADVISORIES MAY BE NEEDED. NEAR-BLIZZARD CONDITIONS CAN BE EXPECTED 
AT TIMES IN THE MTNS. ANOTHER CONCERN IS WIND CHILLS...WHICH WILL BE 
IN THE -5 TO -15 RANGE IN THE MTNS AND SW VA. 

A WINTER STORM WARNING WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE TN MOUNTAINS...WHERE 8 
TO 14 INCH AMOUNTS WILL BE COMMON...WITH GREATER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE IN 
THE HIGHEST TERRAIN. A WARNING WILL ALSO BE ISSUED FOR SW VA...WITH 
AMOUNTS IN THE 5 TO 10 INCH RANGE. HIGH KNOB COULD SEE OVER 12 
INCHES. WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE NORTHERN 
AND CENTRAL TN VALLEY...THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND SW NC. AMOUNTS 
IN THESE AREAS ARE EXPECTED TO RANGE FROM 3 TO 6 IN THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU AND TRI-CITIES AREA AND MOUNTAINS OF SW NC...AND 1 TO 3 IN 
THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND KNOXVILLE AREA. ANOTHER CONCERN IS THE VERY 
COLD TEMPERATURES...WHICH WILL LIKELY HELP MAKE THE ROADS MORE 
HAZARDOUS THAN USUAL FOR SUCH LOW SNOW AMOUNTS. 


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...
DEEP UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST INTO THE NE STATES TUESDAY
WITH ONLY A FEW LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS TUESDAY MORNING NE TN
MOUNTAINS AND SW VIRGINIA AND MINOR ACCUMULATIONS. TEMPERATURES
WILL STILL BE VERY COLD AS SKIES WILL BE MOSTLY SUNNY BUT WITH
ANTICIPATED SNOW COVER HIGHS LESS THAN 20 MOUNTAINS AND 20S TO
LOWER 30S ELSEWHERE. HEIGHTS INCREASE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY
BUT SNOW COVER WILL ALLOW FOR MAXIMUM COOLING TUESDAY NIGHT.
SOUTHERN LOWER ELEVATION AREAS SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER WHERE
SNOW COVER IS NOT EXPECTED BUT OTHERWISE LOWS SINGLE DIGITS TO
LOWER TEENS LIKELY. WEDNESDAY WARMING COMMENCES IN EARNEST BUT AT
THE SAME TIME AN UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE PLAINS STATES WITH
A LOW PRESSURE AREA AND COLD FRONT MOVING INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. LIGHT RAIN DEVELOPS AS EARLY AS
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON ACROSS SOUTHERN PLATEAU AND VALLEY AREAS AND
SPREADS NE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. CENTRAL AND NORTHEAST AREAS MAY
EXPERIENCE SOME LIGHT FREEZING RAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY
THURSDAY BEFORE THE COLD AIR IS SCOURED OUT. THURSDAY PRECIPITATION
SHOULD STAY AS RAIN AS WARMING CONTINUES. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT
WILL MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AND A BROADER TROUGH SETTLES OVER
THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. COLDER AIR AND LINGERING
MOISTURE BRINGS SOME SNOW TO HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND NORTHERN
SECTIONS THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY NIGHT. HIGHER PRESSURE BUILDS
IN SATURDAY SO KEPT LAST DAY DRY. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING
MOISTURE DEPTH AND TIMING OF THURSDAY SYSTEM SO FORECAST COULD
CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS.

952 AM EST SAT DEC 11 2010

.DISCUSSION...
HIGH CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO INCREASE THROUGH THE DAY AHEAD OF A
200 MB JET STREAK LOCATED ACROSS TX/AR/MS. LIFT IN THE LEFT EXIT
REGION OF THIS JET IS GENERATING PRECIP ACROSS WEST TN THIS
MORNING. DRY AIR BELOW 850 MB SEEN IN 12Z OHX SOUNDING WILL LIKELY
KEEP MUCH PRECIP FROM REACHING THE GROUND IN OUR AREA BEFORE 21Z.
AS THE JET MOVES EAST...UPPER DIVERGENCE ANDISENTROPIC UPGLIDE
SHOULD CREATE ENOUGH LIFT FOR PRECIP TO OVERCOME THIS DRY
LAYER...SO OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES MAY SEE SOME LIGHT RAINFALL LATE
THIS AFTERNOON. THE CURRENT POP/WX FORECAST LOOKS GOOD. OBSERVED
TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE FORECAST TEMPS...BUT
BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUD COVER SHOULD KEEP TEMPS FROM RISING VERY
MUCH. 06Z MOS GUIDANCE HAS HIGH TEMPS BELOW THE CURRENT FORECAST.
THE UPDATE WILL ADJUST HIGH TEMPS DOWNWARD A LITTLE AND UPDATE
HOURLY TEMPS/DEWPOINTS.

THE 12Z NAM APPEARS TO HAVE CHANGED LITTLE FROM THE PREVIOUS RUN
FOR THE COMING WINTER STORM. THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECT OF THIS
EVENT WILL BE THE TRANSITION TONIGHT FROM RAIN TO SNOW...AND HOW
THE TIMING OF THIS TRANSITION ALIGNS WITH THE STRONGEST LIFT AND
DEEPEST MOISTURE. THE NAM AND THE GFS DO SEEM TO BE IN BETTER
AGREEMENT WITH TIMING THAN YESTERDAY. IF ALL REMAINS ON
TRACK ONCE THE 12Z MODEL RUNS ARE CLOSELY EXAMINED...EXPECT THAT
WINTER STORM WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES WILL BE ISSUED THIS AFTERNOON.

.AVIATION...STRONG STORM SYSTEM TAKING SHAPE OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL
U.S. THIS MORNING. QUITE A BIT OF AC STREAMING IN AHEAD OF THIS
SYSTEM ACROSS THE TAF SITES WITH A BKN SC LAYER ASSOCIATED WITH
WARM AIR ADVECTION AND WEAK SHORT WAVE TROF. MODELS INDICATE THE
LOWER LAYER SHOULD SCATTER OUT AND SUGGESTS THE AC LAYER MAY EVEN
BECOME SCATTERED AT TIMES. MAIN WEATHER IMPACT FOR FLIGHT WILL BE
AROUND 03Z SUNDAY AND LATER AS STRONG COLD FRONT BUILDS TOWARD THE
REGION. EXPECT IFR CONDITIONS FROM THIS POINT THROUGH THE END OF
THE FORECAST AS MODERATE TO POSSIBLY HEAVY SHOWERS BUILD EAST.
USED LLWS AT CHA AND TYS TONIGHT AS LOW LEVEL JET FORMS IN TIGHT
GRADIENT WITH STRONG STORM SYSTEM. POSSIBILITY EXISTS FOR SOME
LIGHT SNOW TO MIX WITH THE RAIN AFTER 06Z AS 85H TEMPS TAKE A NOSE

423 AM EST SAT DEC 11 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...WARM/MOIST ADVECTION WITH
INCREASING CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF DEVELOPING STORM SYSTEM OVER THE
CENTER OF THE NATION WILL KEEP SKIES PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY TODAY.
STAYED WITH A SMALL/SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR THE WESTERN PART
OF THE FORECAST AREA LATER THIS AFTERNOON AS A STRONG COLD FRONT
RACES EAST ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. DECENT WARMING AHEAD OF
THE FRONT SHOULD BOOST TEMPERATURES INTO THE UPPER 40S AND LOWER
50S ACROSS MUCH OF THE REGION.

RAIN WILL OVERSPREAD ENTIRE AREA TONIGHT AS SYSTEM MOVES IN.  LOOKS 
LIKE THERE COULD BE A BRIEF PERIOD THAT FAVORS MOUNTAIN WAVES WITH 
STRONG WINDS IN THE USUAL HIGHER ELEVATION AND FOOTHILLS AREAS...BUT 
CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO PUT ANY WIND PRODUCTS OUT AT THIS 
TIME. FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH...WITH ARRIVAL OF COLDER AIR LATER 
TONIGHT...BUT STILL SOME DIFFICULTY TIMING CHANGEOVER TO SNOW.  
LOOKS LIKE HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY SEE SOME SNOW LATER TONIGHT...AND 
MAY BEGIN TO MIX EVEN IN VALLEY LOCATIONS TOWARD SUNRISE.  MUCH 
COLDER AIR WILL MOVE IN SUNDAY...AND ALL PRECIP WILL CHANGE TO SNOW 
SHOWERS.  WIND CHILL VALUES WILL DROP SHARPLY...WITH VERY COLD 
CONDITIONS EXPECTED BY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY.  DEEP UPPER TROUGH 
WILL DIG IN SUNDAY...ENHANCING CHANCES FOR SNOW SHOWERS SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON INTO SUNDAY NIGHT.  NORTHWEST FLOW AND COLD ADVECTION 
SHOULD KEEP SNOW SHOWERS LINGERING THROUGH MONDAY.  LOOKS LIKE THIS 
SHOULD BE A BIG EVENT FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...AND EVEN VALLEY 
LOCATIONS ESPECIALLY NORTH AND CENTRAL MAY SEE ACCUMULATING SNOWS.  
SOME QUESTION ABOUT WHETHER NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS WILL REACH HEAVY 
SNOW WARNING CRITERIA IN ANY 12 OR 24 HOUR PERIOD...BUT FOR NOW WILL 
LEAVE WATCH AS IS.  


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DEEP UPPER TROF WILL MOVE 
VERY SLOWLY EAST AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY. SUFFICIENT MOISTURE WILL BE IN PLACE DURING THIS PERIOD FOR 
A CONTINUATION OF NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AS WELL AS THE 
SMOKY MOUNTAINS. THIS EVENT FINALLY COMES TO AN END BY TUESDAY NIGHT 
AS THE TROF SHIFTS FAR ENOUGH AWAY TO THE EAST. BUILDING HEIGHTS 
LATER TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY WILL ALLOW FOR AN APPROXIMATE TEN 
TO TWELVE DEGREE WARMING IN MAX TEMPS WEDNESDAY BUT THIS WILL NOT BE 
ENOUGH TO SAVE THE FORECAST AREA FROM A THREAT FOR FREEZING RAIN 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY MORNING AS THE MODELS SHOW AN UPPER 
TROF DEVELOPING ACROSS THE PLAINS STATES WITH SUFACE WAVE 
DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. WARM AND MOIST AIR 
WILL OVERRIDE THE SUBFREEZING AIRMASS NEAR THE GROUND SETTING THE 
STAGE FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF FREEZING RAIN. STILL A FAIR AMOUNT OF 
UNCERTAINTY CONCERNING MOISTURE DEPTH AND TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM SO 
THIS FORECAST COULD CHANGE OVER THE NEXT FEW DAYS. THE LATE PORTION 
OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD IS RATHER MURKY WITH LARGE DIFFERENCES IN 
THE EXTENDED MODELS BUT STAYED CLOSE TO THE NEIGHBORING WFO 
DEPICTION OF LOW TO MEDIUM CHANCE FOR RAIN THURSDAY WITH DECREASING 
PROBABILITY ON FRIDAY. TRENDED TEMP FORECAST TOWARD IF NOT A FEW 
DEGREES BELOW MEX MOS GUIDANCE DUE TO ARCTIC AIR MASS AND EXPECTED 
SNOW COVER.

255 PM EST FRI DEC 10 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
HIGH CLOUDS WILL INCREASE TONIGHT AHEAD OF A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
AND APPROACHING UPPER JET. A LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL ALLOW 
TEMPS TO WARM INTO THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 50S IN MOST SPOTS TOMORROW.

A CLOSED LOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS SATURDAY WILL TRACK ACROSS THE 
LOWER GREAT LAKES ON SUNDAY. THE UPPER JET ROUNDING THE BASE OF THE 
LOW WILL BE POSITIONED OVER AR/WEST TN...GIVING STRONG UPPER 
DIVERGENCE IN OUR AREA. THIS ALONG WITH MOISTURE TRANSPORT FROM A 
STRENGTHENING LLJ WILL BRING PRECIP TO THE AREA BEGINNING SATURDAY 
EVENING. THE QUESTION IS WHETHER TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLD ENOUGH 
FOR SNOW SATURDAY NIGHT. EXPECT THAT COLD ADVECTION THROUGH THE 
NIGHT WILL CHANGE THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO SNOW AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...THEN DOWN TO THE VALLEY BY SUNRISE. THERE WILL LIKELY BE 
PERIODS OF RAIN/SNOW MIX OR TRANSITIONS DEPENDING ON THE PRECIP 
RATE. ANY SNOW WILL LIKELY BE A VERY WET SNOW WITH LOW LIQUID/FROZEN 
RATIOS. HIGHER ELEVATIONS MAY SEE A COUPLE INCHES SATURDAY 
NIGHT...WITH THE VALLEY SEEING MAYBE A DUSTING TO 1 INCH.

VERY COLD TEMPS ALOFT MOVE IN QUICKLY SUNDAY MORNING...AND WE 
TRANSITION INTO A NW FLOW SNOW EVENT. ALL PRECIP WILL BE SNOW BY 
SUNDAY...BUT IT SHOULD BE LIGHT AS MOISTURE BECOMES MORE SHALLOW. AS 
THE LOW TO THE NORTH DEEPENS...THE NW FLOW PICKS UP TO AROUND 40 KTS 
BY SUNDAY EVENING. A FEED OF MOISTURE OFF LAKE MICHIGAN PERSISTS 
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. THIS SHOULD LEAD TO SIGNIFICANT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS IN OUR MOUNTAINS AND IN SW VA. VERY COLD TEMPS SHOULD 
ALSO GIVE HIGH LIQUID/FROZEN RATIOS. BLOWING AND DRIFTING SNOW WILL 
BE A PROBLEM GIVEN THE STRONG WINDS...AND WIND CHILL VALUES WILL 
APPROACH -10 DEGREES IN THE MOUNTAINS SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY.

A WINTER STORM WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE TN MOUNTAINS...SW 
VA...NE TN INCLUDING TRI-CITIES...AND THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. MOUNTAINS ARE LIKELY TO BE IN THE 6-12 INCH RANGE FOR THE 
WHOLE EVENT. SW VA IS EXPECTED TO SEE AMOUNTS BETWEEN 5 AND 10 
INCHES...WITH GREATER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE AT HIGH KNOB. NE TN AND THE 
NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ARE EXPECTED TO SEE AMOUNTS IN THE 3 TO 
6 INCH RANGE. OTHER VALLEY LOCATIONS AND THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU ARE 
EXPECTED TO SEE 0-3 INCHES.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
NORTHWEST FLOW SNOWFALL TO CONTINUE MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY
MORNING ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND IN THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING
NORTH CAROLINA MONDAY NIGHT. ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL WILL LIKELY
TAPER OFF IN THESE AREAS DURING THIS TIME. VERY COLD AIR AND SNOW
ON THE GROUND IN MOST AREAS WILL BRING LOW TEMPERATURES DOWN TO
NEAR 0 MOUNTAINS AND SINGLE DIGITS NORTHEAST SECTIONS WITH
10 TO 15 DEGREES ELSEWHERE. WIND CHILL TEMPERATURES MONDAY NIGHT
AND EARLY TUESDAY WILL LIKELY BE BELOW ZERO IN NE SECTIONS AND
HIGHER ELEVATION MOUNTAINS AT TIMES. TUESDAY THE UPPER TROF SHIFTS
FARTHER EAST AWAY FROM THE APPALACHIANS WITH DRIER AIR BEGINNING TO
SPREAD IN FROM THE NORTHWEST. WENT ON THE COLD SIDE FOR HIGHS NE
AND MOUNTAINS WITH STILL SOME CLOUDS AROUND IN THE MORNING. HIGHS
MOSTLY 20S TO LOWER 30S BUT TEENS HIGHER MOUNTAINS SW VA AND EAST
TN. TUESDAY NIGHT UNDER CLEAR SKIES ANOTHER VERY COLD NIGHT IN THE
SINGLE DIGITS AND TEENS. WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY A WARMING TREND
COMMENCES AS FLOW FLATTENS OUT. BOTH HIGHS AND LOWS WILL BE
CONSIDERABLY WARMER. A WEAK SHORTWAVE APPROACHES THE REGION
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. SOME FROZEN PRECIPITATION POSSIBLE
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY THURSDAY BEFORE CHANGING TO RAIN. WILL
NOT INCLUDE FREEZING RAIN JUST YET BECAUSE RIGHT NOW LOOKS TO BE
BRIEF. AS THIS NEXT SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH COLDER AIR BEHIND IT COULD
BRING WINTER PRECIPITATION BACK TO HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS LATE
THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY MORNING.

.DISCUSSION...
FOR THE MORNING UPDATE...THIN HIGH CLOUDS WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA
ASSOCIATED WITH AN EASTWARD-MOVING VORT MAX OVER OKLAHOMA. THESE
CLOUDS SHOULD REMAIN THIN AND THE MOSTLY SUNNY FORECAST LOOKS ON
TRACK. TEMPERATURES ARE ON TRACK AS WELL...SO NO CHANGES ARE PLANNED.

INITIAL THOUGHTS ON THE COMING WINTER STORM THIS WEEKEND...THE MAIN
FORECAST CONCERN IS THE TIMING DIFFERENCE OF THE ONSET OF COLD AIR
BETWEEN THE GFS AND THE NAM. THE 06Z GFS IS MUCH FASTER WITH THE
COLD AIR...RESULTING IN NEAR-FREEZING TEMPS IN THE MOUNTAINS DURING
THE PERIOD OF STRONGEST LIFT SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS WOULD MEAN AN ALL
SNOW EVENT FOR THE MOUNTAINS...WHICH WOULD INCREASE SNOW AMOUNTS
SIGNIFICANTLY. THIS WOULD ALSO PRODUCE GREATER SNOW AMOUNTS IN THE
VALLEY. THE SLOWER NAM SHOWS A TRANSITION FROM RAIN TO SNOW IN THE
MOUNTAINS LATE SATURDAY NIGHT...TOWARD THE BACK END OF THE STRONGER
LIFT. THE 12Z NAM HAS TRENDED SLIGHTLY FASTER THAN THE 06Z
NAM...BUT IS STILL BEHIND THE 06Z GFS. WILL AWAIT THE 12Z GFS
BEFORE FINAL DECISIONS ARE MADE...BUT EXPECT THAT WINTER STORM
WATCHES WILL BE ISSUED WITH THE AFTERNOON FORECAST PACKAGE.

SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL HELP TO ENHANCE HIGH CLOUDS AT 
TIMES...BUT SHOULD BE BETWEEN THESE FOR TODAY ALLOWING MOSTLY SUNNY 
CONDITIONS BEFORE CLOUDS INCREASE AGAIN TONIGHT.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE IN 
DEPICTION OF THIS PART OF THE FORECAST. HOWEVER...STAYED MORE IN 
LINE WITH THE ECMWF THROUGH THE PERIOD. DEEP UPPER TROF DROPS 
SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE UPPER MIDWEST ON SATURDAY AND MODELS GENERALLY 
IN AGREEMENT ON A SLOWER PROGRESSION OF MOISTURE/LIFT DURING THE 
DAY. THEREFORE...LOWERED POPS BACK TO LOW CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE 
WITH BEST BET FOR A FEW SPRINKLES AHEAD OF THE ADVANCING SYSTEM 
BEING ACROSS THE WESTERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA. DEEPENING UPPER 
TROF WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM PRESS EAST INTO THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SATURDAY NIGHT AND APPLIED 90 PERCENT POP 
AREAWIDE WITH HEALTHY INFLUX OF MOISTURE AHEAD OF FRONT. RATHER 
DECENT RAINFALL AMOUNTS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD THREE QUARTERS OF AN 
INCH POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONG SYSTEM. MUCH COLDER AIR WILL BUILD IN 
BEHIND THE FRONT TOWARD SUNDAY MORNING AND WITH CHILLY AIR STREAMING 
IN ALOFT...THE RAIN WILL MIX WITH AND CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS 
PRIMARILY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN WITH SOME MINOR ACCUMULATION 
POSSIBLE BY 12Z SUNDAY AS THE MOISTURE AXIS ASSOCIATED WITH THE COLD 
FRONT SHIFTS EAST. THERE COULD BE A BRIEF PERIOD AFTER 12Z SUNDAY 
WHERE PRECIP BECOMES LIGHTER AS NARROW DRY SLOT MOVES IN BEHIND THE 
FRONT. HOWEVER...MODELS CONTINUE TO INDICATE DEEPER MOISTURE BUILDS 
IN ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE MEAN UPPER TROF WITH RAPIDLY FALLING 
THICKNESS DURING THE DAY SUNDAY SO RAIN SHOWERS WILL MIX WITH OR 
CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS WITH LIKELY SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. ANOTHER LONGER TERM NORTHWEST FLOW 
SNOWFALL EVENT MAY TAKE SHAPE BEGINNING ON SUNDAY WITH CONTINUATION 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS 
BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA. ACCUMULATING SNOWFALL LIKELY IN THESE 
AREAS THROUGH THIS PERIOD WHILE STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY PRESENT 
CONCERNING ANY SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS AT 
THIS TIME. BY TUESDAY THE EVENT SHOULD BE OVER AS THE UPPER TROF 
WILL HAVE SHIFTED FARTHER EAST AWAY FROM THE APPALACHIANS WITH DRIER 
AIR ADVECTION IN THE PREVAILING NORTHWEST FLOW. FORECAST AREA ENJOYS 
APPROXIMATELY TWO DAYS OF DRY WEATHER ALONG WITH A MODEST WARMING 
TREND. WEAK SHORTWAVE TROF BUILDS INTO THE REGION ON THURSDAY BUT 
DUE TO TIMING AND STRENGTH OF THIS FEATURE LOWERED POPS TO SLIGHT OR 
LOW CHANCE WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY.

MID LEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT IS GREATER. WHILE FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A 
DRY LAYER FROM THE SURFACE TO AROUND 900 MB...SOME LIGHT PRECIP MAY 
REACH THE GROUND LATE FRIDAY NIGHT ONCE THE LOW LEVELS BEGIN TO 
MOISTEN. TEMPS AT THIS TIME WILL LIKELY BE NEAR OR BELOW 
FREEZING...SO WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE OF LIGHT

BIG CHANGES IN THE CURRENT TRANQUIL PATTERN SATURDAY AS DEVELOPING

WILL FALL BELOW FREEZING ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION WITH RAIN 
CHANGING TO SNOW. SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL IS POSSIBLE ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS OF EAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. FOR THE VALLEY 
AREAS LIGHT ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE LATE SUNDAY INTO MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE REGION 
PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT. SKY SHOULD REMAIN 
MOSTLY SUNNY TODAY BUT INCREASING UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS EXPECTED 
TONIGHT AHEAD OF A WEAK SHORTWAVE. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE A BIT 
WARMER TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH UPPER LEVELS BECOME MORE ZONAL. BUT 
WITH THE COLD LOWER LEVELS..SHOULD STILL BELOW BE BELOW NORMAL FOR 
TODAY. GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY WERE SIMILAR SO 
DIDN'T STRAY TOO FAR. SOME DIFFERENCES IN TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT. 
WITH THE INCREASE IN CLOUDS...WENT ABOVE MAV GUIDANCE AND STAYED 
CLOSER TO THE MET/MAV BLEND FOR TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WITH THE MAIN STORY BEING THE AMPLIFYING UPPER-LEVEL 
PATTERN FOR THE WEEKEND. THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL GRADUALLY BECOME 
A LITTLE SOUTHWESTERLY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SATURDAY...WITH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS INDICATING ISENTROPIC LIFT 
INCREASING OVER THE FORECAST AREA...POSSIBLY RESULTING IN SOME VERY 
LIGHT PRECIP AFTER MIDNIGHT ON FRIDAY NIGHT. WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO 
BE HOVERING AROUND THE FREEZING MARK...IT APPEARS THAT SOME LIGHT 
FREEZING RAIN MAY BE POSSIBLE AROUND SUNRISE ON SATURDAY MORNING... 
BUT RIGHT NOW IT APPEARS THAT AMOUNTS SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT. ON 
SATURDAY...THE GFS...NAM AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
THE TRACK OF A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM...BUT NOW INDICATE THAT IT 
WILL BE A LITTLE FURTHER NORTH TOWARDS THE GREAT LAKES REGION. IN 
ADDITION...THE GFS MODEL IS A LITTLE FASTER THAN THE NAM OR ECMWF 
MODELS WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT... 
WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE PROGGED TO BE AROUND MIDNIGHT (BUT AROUND 
SUNRISE ACCORDING TO THE NAM AND ECMWF MODELS). ALL THREE MODELS 
ALSO INDICATE A WEAKER LOW-LEVEL 850 MB JET OVER THE REGION SATURDAY 
NIGHT...WITH WINDS POSSIBLY REMAINING SOUTHWESTERLY AHEAD OF THE COLD
FRONT. THUS...THE POSSIBILITY OF A HIGH WIND EVENT DUE TO MOUNTAIN 
WAVES FOR SATURDAY NIGHT APPEARS TO BE DIMINISHING. RAIN SHOULD 
GRADUALLY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 
MIDNIGHT ON SATURDAY NIGHT...AS NORTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS OVER THE 
REGION ON SUNDAY RESULTING IN A SCENARIO THAT APPEARS VERY SIMILAR 
TO THE ONE FROM EARLIER THIS WEEK (WITH THE GREAT LAKES PROVIDING 
ADDITIONAL MOISTURE FOR SNOW DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA). 
ANOTHER FRIGID AND UNSEASONABLY COLD ARCTIC AIR MASS WILL SETTLE 
ACROSS THE REGION BY SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...BUT THE GFS AND 
ECMWF MODELS INDICATE A RAPID WARMING TREND DEVELOPING BY THE MIDDLE 
OF NEXT WEEK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS THE GFS 
MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TO OUR SOUTH WILL BE MOVING OFF THE ATLANTIC 
COASTLINE TONIGHT. HIGH AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL DECREASE THIS 
EVENING AS TEH SYSTEM DEPARTS. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AND A MID/UPPER 
LEVEL RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST. MOSTLY 
CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT WILL DROP TEMPS INTO THE TEENS...AND ALLOW HIGH 
TEMPS TOMORROW TO REACH INTO THE 40S SOUTH AND MID/UPPER 30S NORTH. 

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MAIN FORECAST CONCERN 
IS STRONG UPPER TROUGH MOVING FROM THE PLAINS STATES INTO THE 
EASTERN UNITED STATES. THERE ARE SOME DISSAGREEMENTS BETWEEN THE 
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS WITH THE GFS THE FARTHER SOUTH AND STRONGEST 
WITH THE SYSTEM. THE ECMWF HAS A NORTHERN TRACK ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY. WILL FOLLOW NCEP ADVICE AND ENSEMBLES WITH A COMPROMISE. 

ISENTROPIC PRECIPITATION WILL START LATE FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY 
MORNING. BOUNDARY LAYER AIRMASS WILL BE COLD ENOUGH TO START AS 
FREEZING RAIN AND/OR SLEET...THEN CHANGE TO ALL LIQUID DURING THE 
DAY SATURDAY. ONLY MINOR ICE ACCUMULATIONS ANTICIPATED.

FAIRLY STRONG FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY 
NIGHT AND SUNDAY MORNING ALONG WITH LARGE SCALE FORCING IN THE FORM 
OF Q-VECTORS CONVERGENCE AND AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL CIRCULATION.

AS FRONT MOVES EAST AND CYCLOGENESIS INTENSIFIES OFF THE 
MID-ATLANTIC COASTS...STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS. GFS SHOWS 
NORTHWEST WINDS AT 850MB UP TO 40KTS+...WHICH IS LIKELY 
OVERDONE...BUT WILL BE STRONG. MODELS SHOWS STRONG NORTHWEST 
BOUNDARY LAYER FLOW CONTINUING THROUGH MONDAY EVENING-NIGHT. ONLY 
LIMITING FACTOR IS DEPTH OF MOISTURE. AT TIMES...MOISTURE DEPTH IS 
ONLY UP TO 850-800MB. HOWEVER...THE -12 TO -18C LAYER REMAINS 
SATURATED THROUGH MOST OF MONDAY NIGHT. A MOISTURE PLUME IS ALSO 
OBSERVED BY MODELS FROM THE GREAT LAKES WHICH WILL ENHANCE LOW-LEVEL 
INSTABILITY. SIGNIFICANT UPSLOPE NORTHWEST FLOW EVENT IS ANTICIPATED 
FOR SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT.

UPPER TROUGH LIFTS NORTHEAST BY TUESDAY. GFS SHOWS ANOTHER WEAK 
SYSTEM BY WEDNESDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE VERY LOW...SO WILL REMAIN DRY 
FOR NOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKING TO NORTH 
OF THE CWA TODAY AND TONIGHT. DEEPEST MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH SO NOT 
EXPECTING PRECIPITATION FROM THE DISTURBANCE. A TROUGH TRACKS WELL 
TO THE SOUTH OF AREA TODAY. HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE REGION SHOULD 
PROVIDE DRY WEATHER TODAY AND TONIGHT. NORTHWEST FLOW OVER THE 
REGION SHOULD CONTINUE THE WELL BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY WERE SIMILAR SO

FOR TONIGHT. WITH THE MOSTLY CLEAR SKY EXPECTED TONIGHT...STAYED A 
LITTLE BELOW MAV GUIDANCE AND WENT CLOSER TO THE MET/MAV BLEND FOR 
TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WITH THE 
MAIN STORY BEING THE UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN BECOMING HIGHLY AMPLIFIED 
FOR THE WEEKEND RESULTING IN A STRONG SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...HIGH PRESSURE 
ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WILL CONTINUE TO SLOWLY SLIDE 
EASTWARD...WITH A WARMING TREND DEVELOPING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A 
WEAK UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
ON FRIDAY...BUT MODELS AGREE THAT ANY PRECIP WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL 
STAY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. ON SATURDAY...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS 
HAVE COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE TRACK OF THE STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WHICH WILL BRING A GOOD 
CHANCE FOR RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO REVEAL SOME INDICATIONS FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF 
A HIGH WIND EVENT DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVES ON SATURDAY NIGHT AROUND THE 
MOUNTAINS...WITH A DEEP SURFACE-BASED STABLE LAYER AND A STRONG 850 
MB SOUTHERLY JET DEVELOPING. BY SUNDAY...ANOTHER FRIGID AND 
UNSEASONABLY COLD ARCTIC AIR MASS WILL MOVE BACK INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA...WITH STRONG NORTHWEST FLOW CREATING SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE 
REGION...ESPECIALLY IN THE UPSLOPE AREAS OF THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR

UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE OVER THE UPPER OHIO RIVER VALLEY IS PROGGED

THIS NORTHWEST FLOW UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN WILL BEGIN TO BECOME MORE 
ZONAL THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO TONIGHT...SO EXPECT SNOW SHOWERS TO

254 PM EST MON DEC 6 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...PERSISTENT CYCLONIC 
CIRCULATION AROUND A DEEP UPPER LOW OVER FAR NORTHEAST UNITED STATES 
REMAINS THE MAIN FEATURE FOR THE FORECAST AREA. A SERIES OF 
SHORT-WAVES ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE 
PERIODS OF ENHANCED MOISTURE AND LIFT. ONE SUCH WAVE IS MOVING INTO 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH ANOTHER FOR LATER TONIGHT. MAIN CONCERN IS 
UPSLOPE FLOW INTO WEST TO NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES. WE CONTINUE TO 
RECEIVE REPORTS OF LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. DUE TO HIGH SNOW TO LIQUID RATIOS...MARGINAL 
PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS WILL PRODUCE SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALLS...SO WILL 
CONTINUE WSW.

OCCASIONAL FLURRIES ANTICIPATED IN THE VALLEYS...BUT ONLY A DUSTING 
AT BEST ANTICIPATED.

NEXT CONCERN IS WIND CHILLS. A FEW AREAS ACROSS THE HIGHEST 
ELEVATIONS WILL EXPERIENCE WIND CHILLS BELOW -10F...BUT COVERAGE 
AREA IS VERY LIMITED...SO WILL NOT ISSUE AN ADVISORY.

CLOUDS WILL SLOWLY ERODE FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST TONIGHT THROUGH 
TUESDAY...BUT TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN MUCH BELOW NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...COLD CONTINUES THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. WEAK WARM UP THURSDAY AS LOW LEVEL FLOW TURNS SW IN 
ADVANCE OF APPROACHING FRONT. LIGHT PCPN WILL BEGIN LATE THU AND 
CONTINUE FRI. LOW LEVEL REMAINS DRY SO AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE 
LIGHT WITH SNOW BECOMING LIGHT RAIN. STRONG SYSTEM TAKING SHAPE FOR 
NEXT WEEKEND. GOOD WAA PATTERN FOR SAT. EXPECT SHOWERS BUT THUNDERSTORM
ACTIVITY MAY GET INTO THE AREA DEPENDING ON SYSTEM EVOLUTION. 
TEMPERATURES PLUMMET SAT NIGHT WITH FROPA. UPSLOPE PATTERN LOOKS 
VERY FAVORABLE AT THIS TIME SUN AND MONDAY. H85 WINDS NW 45 KTS WITH 
TEMPS FALLING TO NEAR -15C. GFS DEPICTS VERY COLD TEMPS IN THE

FLURRIES OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING... 
RESULTING FROM A MOIST NORTHWEST FLOW FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION. 
THIS HIGH WILL REMAIN CENTERED OVER THE PLAINS THROUGH TONIGHT... 
BRINGING A PERSISTENT NORTHWEST WIND FLOW OVER THE APPALACHIANS. 
WITH A SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE REMAINING AROUND 850 MB...EXPECT 
SCATTERED FLURRIES AND/OR SNOW SHOWERS TO CONTINUE ACROSS MAINLY THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GFS AND NAM MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH IN NORTHEAST 
PRODUCING NORTHWEST FLOW OVER AREA AND THIS PERSISTS THROUGH ABOUT 
THURSDAY...WHEN THE FLOW BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AND TEND TOWARD 
ZONAL. H10-H5 THICKNESSES ARE FAIRLY LOW...LOW ENOUGH FOR SNOW 
EVERYWHERE...BUT AIRMASS IS PRETTY DRY TOO...SO HAVE LIMITED POPS TO 
CHANCE AT BEST...EVEN IN FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS ALL WEEK. EVEN THEN 
EXPECT MAINLY FLURRIES WITH SPRINKLES IN WARMEST AREAS TO THE SOUTH. 
BY FRIDAY A FRONT APPROACHES WITH A QUITE IMPRESSIVE SURFACE 
PRESSURE GRADIENT...AND SO WINDS WILL TURN SOUTHERLY AND THICKNESSES 
WILL BEGIN RISING AGAIN FOR A LITTLE WARM UP ON THE WEEKEND. 
SATURDAY SHOULD SEEM QUITE TROPICAL COMPARED TO THE ICEBOX WE WILL 
HAVE BEEN IN FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEK. LOOKS ALSO LIKE A 
CHANCE FOR SOME MODERATE RAIN ON THE WEEKEND. WILL NOT GO OVERBOARD 
WITH THE POPS THIS FAR OUT. BUT STAY TUNED. ADJUSTED THE MAX TEMPS

LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE PLAINS...BRINGING COLD 
AND DRY AIR OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED 
FLURRIES OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING... 
RESULTING FROM A MOIST NORTHWEST FLOW FROM THE GREAT LAKES REGION. 
THIS HIGH WILL REMAIN CENTERED OVER THE PLAINS THROUGH TONIGHT... 
BRINGING A PERSISTENT NORTHWEST WIND FLOW OVER THE APPALACHIANS. 
WITH A SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE REMAINING AROUND 850 MB...EXPECT 
SCATTERED FLURRIES AND/OR SNOW SHOWERS TO CONTINUE ACROSS MAINLY THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GFS AND NAM MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE WHERE SOME DIFFERENCES ARE 
NOTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH IN NORTHEAST 
PRODUCING NORTHWEST FLOW OVER AREA AND THIS PERSISTS THROUGH ABOUT 
THURSDAY...WHEN THE FLOW BEGINS TO STRAIGHTEN OUT AND TEND TOWARD 
ZONAL. H10-H5 THICKNESSES ARE FAIRLY LOW...LOW ENOUGH FOR SNOW 
EVERYWHERE...BUT AIRMASS IS PRETTY DRY TOO...SO HAVE LIMITED POPS TO 
CHANCE AT BEST...EVEN IN FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS ALL WEEK. EVEN THEN 
EXPECT MAINLY FLURRIES WITH SPRINKLES IN WARMEST AREAS TO THE SOUTH. 
BY FRIDAY A FRONT APPROACHES WITH A QUITE IMPRESSIVE SURFACE 
PRESSURE GRADIENT...AND SO WINDS WILL TURN SOUTHERLY AND THICKNESSES 
WILL BEGIN RISING AGAIN FOR A LITTLE WARM UP ON THE WEEKEND. 
SATURDAY SHOULD SEEM QUITE TROPICAL COMPARED TO THE ICEBOX WE WILL 
HAVE BEEN IN FOR THE FIRST HALF OF THE WEEK. LOOKS ALSO LIKE A 
CHANCE FOR SOME MODERATE RAIN ON THE WEEKEND. WILL NOT GO OVERBOARD 
WITH THE POPS THIS FAR OUT. BUT STAY TUNED. ADJUSTED THE MAX TEMPS 
DOWN NEARLY EVERYWHERE IN THE FIRST PART OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD AS 
LATEST GFS IS COLDER THAN LAST FORECAST PACKAGE.

VERY LIGHT PRECIP OVER THE FORECAST AREA AND FURTHER UPSTREAM OVER 
EASTERN KY...SO WILL PLAN TO CANCEL THE WINTER WX ADVISORY EARLY 
THIS MORNING FOR AREAS OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. THE LARGE HIGH OVER 
THE PLAINS WILL REMAIN OVER THE MUCH OF THE CENTRAL PART OF THE 
NATION TODAY AND TONIGHT...CREATING A PERSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THESE NORTHWEST WINDS WILL CREATE AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDINESS OVER THE REGION...ALONG WITH SOME 
UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS. MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE 
WILL BE SHALLOW OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...BUT UPSLOPE 
FLOW IN THE MOUNTAINS MAY SQUEEZE OUT SOME ADDITIONAL LIGHT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS. THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER WX ADVISORY FOR THE 
SMOKY MOUNTAIN AND NORTHEAST TN MOUNTAINS FOR TODAY. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GFS AND NAM MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES REMAIN 
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM BEFORE 
DETERIORATING INTO GENERAL DISAGREEMENT. UPPER LONG WAVE TROUGH 
PERSISTS THROUGH MID WEEK BEFORE DEAMPLIFYING INTO NEARLY ZONAL 
FLOW. THIS WILL RESULT IN SLOW MODERATION OF TEMPS ALTHOUGH TEMPS IN 
GENERAL WILL REMAIN BELOW CLIMO. BIGGEST UNCERTAINTY RESULTS FROM 
SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES BY LATE WORK WEEK. ECMWF MODEL DEPICTS FAIRLY 
SIGNIFICANT SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WHILE GFS DEPICTS RATHER 
INSIGNIFICANT NORTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WITH LIMITED IMPACTS ON 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. DUE TO LOW CONFIDENCE WITH THIS 
EVENT...HAVE NOT MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PRECEDING

338 PM EST SAT DEC 4 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...SURFACE LOW JUST WEST OF TRI
AT MID AFTERNOON WITH MUCH OF THE LARGE PRECIPITATION SHIELD MOVING
OUT OF ALL BUT SW VA AND THE NE CORNER OF TN. STARTING TO SEE THE
EFFECTS OF COLDER AIR MOVING IN...WITH SURFACE OBSERVATIONS NOTING A
SNOW...SLEET AND RAIN MIX AGAIN...AFTER MOSTLY RAIN OUTSIDE OF THE
ADVISORY AREA AND SNOW IN THE ADVISORY AREA. CALLS MADE TO ADVISORY
AREA WERE SENT OUT VIA LSRS...AND AMOUNTS IN GENERAL LOOKED IN LINE
WITH CURRENT FORECAST...AND OF COURSE USUALLY DIFFICULT TO GET A
LOT OF REPORTS OUT OF THE HIGHEST TERRAIN AREAS.

FORCING WILL PRIMARILY BE COLD AIR ADVECTION AND LOW LEVEL NW
UPSLOPE FLOW FROM THIS EVENING INTO OVERNIGHT. RUC AND NAM 12KM MODELS
SHOW SOME UPSLOPE SNOW DEVELOPING IN THE SMOKIES...SO I ADDED THAT
AREA TO THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY. WILL LET EVENING SHIFT WATCH FOR
UPSLOPE SNOW DEVELOPMENT...AND EXTEND THE ADVISORY IF NEEDED.

OTHERWISE...MADE LITTLE CHANGES TO FORECAST GRIDS FOR SUNDAY...AS 
THIS EVENT DOES NOT LOOK LIKE A STRONG NW FLOW EVENT. THUS...POPS
ONLY FOR UPSLOPE AREAS LOOKED GOOD. FAVORED A MOS BLEND FOR MINS
TONIGHT AND COLDER MOS FOR HIGHS SUNDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...NOT MUCH CHANGE FROM 
PREVIOUS FORECAST. LONG WAVE TROUGH OVER EASTERN NOAM WILL AFFECT 
OUR WEATHER FOR MOST OF THE LONG RANGE PERIOD. NORTHWEST FLOW SHOWER 
WITH COLD AIR WILL PROVIDE FOR MOSTLY SNOW SHOWERS, ALBEIT LIGHT, 
FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND INTO MONDAY. THEN AIRMASS DRIES OUT BUT STAYS 
COLD THROUGH MID-WEEK. SOME RISING THICKNESSES AS LATE PERIOD FRONT 
APPROACHES BUT STILL IN THE 540'S FOR A CHILLY PERIOD. ALL IN ALL, 
AN UNSETTLED PERIOD BUT NOTHING SERIOUS. ADJUSTED TEMPS IN EARLY 
PART OF PERIOD TOWARD THE BLEND FIGURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS...WITH A WEAK WARM FRONT 
EXTENDING SOUTHEAST OF IT ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. AREA RADARS REVEAL A 
LARGE AREA OF LIGHT SNOW OVER KY AND THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WHICH 
EXTENDS SOUTHWARD OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VA. MODELS 
AGREE THAT THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL QUICKLY MOVE ACROSS THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY TODAY...BRINGING AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF PRECIP INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA. GFS AND NAM MODELS AGREE THAT THE RAIN/SNOW LINE 
SHOULD GENERALLY BE ALONG A LONDON KY TO GREENEVILLE TN LINE (OR 
HALFWAY BETWEEN THE KNOXVILLE AND TRI-CITIES AREAS). WITH THIS IN 
MIND...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR NORTHEAST TN 
AND SOUTHWEST VA FOR TODAY AND INTO THIS EVENING. IT APPEARS THAT THE 
REST OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE IN THE WARM SECTOR OF THIS 
SYSTEM...WHERE MOSTLY RAIN SHOULD OCCUR UNTIL SUNSET WHEN THE COLD 
FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM PASSES THROUGH. AFTER THIS COLD 
FRONT MOVES THROUGH AROUND SUNSET...RAIN SHOULD GRADUALLY CHANGE TO 
SNOW FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...MOST OF THE 
MOISTURE WITH THIS SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO HAVE MOVED EAST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA BY THIS EVENING...SO DO NOT EXPECT MUCH ACCUMULATIONS 
OUTSIDE OF THE ADVISORY AREA. ONE EXCEPTION MAY BE THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS WHERE SOME UPSLOPE FLOW MAY CREATE SOME ADVISORY LEVEL 
ACCUMULATIONS THIS EVENING...BUT WILL LET THE DAY SHIFT DECIDE IF AN 
ADVISORY IS NEEDED LATER FOR THIS AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM 
MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MAXES FOR 
TODAY...AND WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW THE COOLER NAM NUMBERS DUE TO THE 
EXPECTED CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...GENERALLY DRY...ALBEIT 
ANOMALOUSLY COLD...CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO PREVAIL THROUGH MOST OF 
THE LONG TERM AS UPPER LONG WAVE TROUGH PERSISTS OVER THE EASTERN 
CONUS. SNOW SHOWERS EXPECTED TO LINGER IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN OF THE 
NORTHEASTERN ZONES INTO EARLY WORK WEEK WHEN UPPER TROUGH AMPLIFIES...
ENFORCING COLD REGIME. UPPER TROUGH SLOWLY DEAMPLIFIES THROUGH THE
BALANCE OF THE WORK WEEK ALLOWING HEIGHTS TO RISE AND TEMPS TO
SLOWLY MODERATE BY WEEK'S END. MEDIUM RANGE MODELS DEPICT SYSTEM
APPROACHING SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM.
HOWEVER...THEY DIFFER WITH RESPECT TO TIMING AND INTENSITY OF
SYSTEM. HAVE INTRODUCED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY...BUT
CONFIDENCE TOO LOW TO GO ANY HIGHER AT THIS POINT. FOR TEMPS...
GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...COMMS PROBLEMS WITH AWIPS
SBN LIMITED MODEL AND MOS DATA FOR THIS FORECAST PACKAGE. HOWEVER
THERE WAS SOME CONTINUITY AND HELP FROM NATIONAL GUIDANCE...PLUS
PREVIOUS GRIDS WERE ON TRACK AND GOOD COORDINATION WITH ADJACENT
NWS OFFICES. NAM 12Z MODEL DATA WAS AVAILABLE AND SEEMS THAT LATEST
NAM RUN WAS WARMER THAN THE PREVIOUSLY COLDER 00Z AND 06Z...WHICH
SUGGESTED HEAVIER SNOWS FOR SW VA AND EXTREME NE TN (IN LINE WITH
HPC WWD GRAPHICS). HPC PREFERED A BLEND OF NAM WITH GFS AND
ESPECIALLY ECMWF...WHICH LED ME TO QUESTION THOSE HEAVIER NAM SNOW
AMOUNTS. 

GFS MODEL WAS TRICKLING IN AT ISSUANCE TIME...BUT NO MOS DATA WAS
IN FROM EITHER NAM OR GFS...WHICH CAUSED ME TO BE CAUTIOUS AND NOT
ISSUE A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY JUST YET. DID MENTION SNOW AMOUNTS
IN FAVORED AREAS OF SW VA AND NE TN AND COVERED THIS EVENT FOR NOW
IN A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT (SPS). TRACK AFFECTS 850 MB TEMPS
AND LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES...AS WELL AS TIMING...SO MIDNIGHT SHIFT
SHOULD GET A BETTER FEEL FOR ISSUING WINTER WEATHER PRODUCTS.

DID NOT PLAY UP SNOW POTENTIAL BEYOND SUNDAY MORNING...AS NAM MODEL
SHOWED ARCTIC AIRMASS WITH VERY SHALLOW MOIST LAYER...AND NOT MUCH 
INSTABILITY AT ALL FOR DAYTIME SUNDAY (20 J/KG OR LESS). NW UPSLOPE
FLOW AND STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION SHOULD CONTINUE TO SQUEEZE OUT
FLURRIES.

OTHERWISE...NO MOS GUIDANCE TO PONDER...SO STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS
MIN/MAX TEMP GRIDS AND NEIGHBORS GRIDS.
 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE BIG CHILL WILL 
CONTINUE THROUGH THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST AS AN UPPER TROF PARKS 
OVER THE EASTERN U.S. FOR SEVERAL DAYS. A MORE ZONAL CONFIGURATION 
DEVELOPS BY THURSDAY/FRIDAY BUT THE ARCTIC AIRMASS WILL BE SLOW TO 
MODIFY. SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL MOVE ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS 
IN CLIPPER FASHION EARLY IN THE PERIOD BRINGING A FEW SNOW SHOWERS 
TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND A SMALL PART OF THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BEFORE 
DRY ADVECTION ENDS THE CHANCE FOR SNOW. SUNSHINE RETURNS IN FULL BY 
MID WEEK WHILE SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S.

.DISCUSSION...JET STREAM CIRRUS CLOUDS WILL INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON 
AND INHIBIT SOME SUNSHINE. HOWEVER...CURRENT TEMPS AND 12Z OHX/RNK 
SOUNDINGS SUPPORT HIGHS MOSTLY IN THE 40S TO LOWER 50S. THIS IS IN 
LINE WITH CURRENT FORECAST. I DO PLAN TO ADJUST HOURLY TEMP GRIDS 
AFTER VIEWING 16Z SURFACE OBSERVATIONS...AND WILL UPDATE A FEW WEB 
PRODUCTS. 

OTHERWISE...TURNING ATTENTION TO SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT'S 
WEATHER. MOISTURE AND LIFT SEEM TO MAINLY ARRIVE DURING THE DAY 
SATURDAY...WITH THE 12Z NAM MODEL A BIT COLDER THAN THE GFS. BEST 
THREAT OF ACCUMULATING SNOW STILL APPEARS TO BE ACROSS SWRN VA AND 
THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS OF NE TN...MAINLY FROM SATURDAY EVENING 
THROUGH SUNDAY MORNING. THE ARCTIC AIRMASS SLIPS IN SUNDAY MORNING 
AND THE MOISTURE DEPTH GREATLY DECREASES...WITH LATEST NAM NOT 
REALLY SHOWING MUCH INSTABILITY ON SUNDAY TO HELP GENERATE SNOW 
SHOWERS OUTSIDE OF THE FAVORED UPSLOPE PEAKS AND RIDGES. 

BEST SNOW GROWTH POTENTIAL SHOULD BE OVER SWRN VA SATURDAY NIGHT
WHERE WE HAVE LIKELY POPS AND A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION MENTIONED.
THIS LOOKS GOOD FOR NOW...AND I PLAN TO ISSUE AN SPS THIS AFTERNOON 
AFTER VIEWING ALL 12Z MODEL DATA AND COORDINATING WITH ADJACENT NWS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM NEAR THE CONFLUENCE OF THE MS AND OHIO 
RIVERS...WITH A COLD AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE 
IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDS OVER THE NORTHERN HALF 
OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING...WITH AREA RADARS REVEALING SOME 
LIGHT ECHOES OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. HOWEVER...OB SITES 
HAVE NOT REPORTED ANY MEASURABLE PRECIP...WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT 
THE OBSERVED DRY LOW-LEVEL AIR MASS IS CAUSING MOST OF THIS MOISTURE 
TO EVAPORATE BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND. MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE 
WILL BE LIMITED WITH THIS WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TODAY...RESULTING 
IN MAINLY SOME CLOUDS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. CLOUDS SHOULD INCREASE 
SOME MORE TONIGHT AS MOISTURE AHEAD OF ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE HIGH PLAINS QUICKLY MOVES TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA. WILL 
PLAN TO CONTINUE WITH A MENTION OF A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR RAIN/SNOW 
AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...BUT MODEL SOUNDINGS AGAIN REVEAL A DRY 
LOW-LEVEL AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA WHICH WOULD SUGGEST THAT 
MOST OF THIS MOISTURE MAY EVAPORATE BEFORE REACHING THE GROUND. AS 
FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...REGION REMAINS IN CYCLONIC 
NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM. A SERIES OF 
WEAK SHORT WAVES WILL TRANSLATE THROUGH THE FLOW RESULTING IN 
SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED WEATHER. INITIAL SYSTEM ON SATURDAY APPEARS MOST 
SIGNIFICANT OF THESE DISTURBANCES AT THIS TIME. POTENTIAL FOR SOME 
SNOW ACCUMULATION SATURDAY NIGHT ALTHOUGH THAT SHOULD BE CONFINED 
MAINLY TO THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES AND HIGHER TERRAIN. ANOTHER WEAK 
SYSTEM APPROACHES BY EARLY WEDNESDAY. UPPER FLOW AMPLIFIES BY EARLY 
NEXT WORK WEEK REINFORCING COLD AIR REGIME BEFORE SLOWLY 
DEAMPLIFYING BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM. OVERALL...DID NOT MAKE ANY 
MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...CLOUDS HAVE BEEN 
THICKENING THIS AFTERNOON...ALTHO STILL MAINLY MID AND HIGH CLOUDS 
OVER OUR FORECAST AREA. MAIN LIFT APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
LEFT FRONT QUAD OF THE UPPER LEVEL JET (CENTRAL PLAINS TO MID MS 
VALLEY) AND SOME WEAK ISENTROPIC FORCING. MAIN SURFACE WEATHER NOTED 
WAS LIGHT SNOW AT BOWLING GREEN KY...WITH LOCAL WRF MODEL SUGGESTING 
LIGHT PRECIPITATION OVER MAINLY SW VA LATE TONIGHT. OPTED TO CARRY A 
LOW POP FOR NRN PLATEAU...SW VA AND NE TN FOR TONIGHT...AND A 
MENTION OF SPRINKLES OR FLURRIES FOR CENTRAL VALLEY AND SMOKIES.

OTHERWISE...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT IS SETTING UP AND A SURFACE LOW 
APPROACHES BY SATURDAY MORNING. 850 MB LOW IS TO OUR NORTH SO THAT 
WE STAY IN A BRIEF WARM SECTOR...AND SHOULD THEREFORE EXPERIENCE 
MAINLY RAIN THROUGH SATURDAY AND POSSIBLY INTO EARLY SATURDAY 
EVENING. I DID NUDGE POPS UP TO LIKELY BY SATURDAY AFTERNOON FOR 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 

MOS TEMPS CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED...EXCEPT I DID CHOOSE TO 
UNDERCUT EVEN THE COOLER MOS HIGHS FOR SATURDAY. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS RELATIVELY 
CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION HAS ENJOYED ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES DEEP INTO 
LATE FALL. THIS PERIOD WILL BE CHARACTERIZED BY WELL BELOW NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES AS MEAN UPPER LEVEL TROUGHING FORMS OVER THE EASTERN 
U.S. THE FIRST SHORTWAVE WILL BE EXITING SATURDAY NIGHT TAKING 
DEEPER MOISTURE EAST OF THE REGION BY SUNDAY MORNING. CHILLY AIR 
WILL STREAM INTO THE REGION ON STRENGTHENING NORTHWEST FLOW 
RESULTING IN LIGHT RAIN CHANGING TO VERY LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS 
THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. THIS WILL BE THE 
BEGINNING OF A LENGTHY PERIOD OF COLD AIR ADVECTION OROGRAPHICALLY 
INDUCED SNOW SHOWERS. AS IS USUALLY THE CASE IN THIS TYPE OF PATTERN 
EFFECTIVE SNOWFALL WILL BE MAINLY LIMITED TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS. SOME UNCERTAINTY IN COLD AIR ARRIVAL AND DEEPER MOISTURE 
DEPARTURE SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY BUT THE HIGHER TERRAIN COULD 
PICK UP AROUND AN INCH OF SNOW BY 12Z SUN WITH AN ADDITIONAL HALF 
INCH BY 00Z MON WITH A DUSTING IN THE LOWEST ELEVATIONS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. HELD ONTO SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SUNDAY NIGHT 
INTO MONDAY AS THE NORTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES WITH MOIST FETCH OFF THE 
GREAT LAKES. MODELS PICK UP ON ANOTHER SHORTWAVE FEATURE FOR LATER 
TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY MORNING. THEREFORE APPLIED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR SNOW SHOWERS MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES INCLUDING 
THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...MOUNTAINS OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND HIGHER TERRAIN IN NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND ALONG THE NORTH 
CAROLINA BORDER. OROGRAPHICS COULD ALLOW FOR SNOW ACCUMULATION IN 
THESE AREAS. THE NORTHWEST FLOW FINALLY WEAKENS AND DRIES OUT BY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY AS HIGH TEMPERATURES ONLY SLOWLY 
MODERATE.

SWINGS ACROSS THE REGION BETWEEN NOW AND ABOUT 18Z. LIGHT
PRECIPITATION WILL CONTINUE THIS MORNING AND NO SIGNIFICANT SNOW
ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED BEFORE IT ENDS. HIGHS WILL LIKELY BE
BEFORE SUNRISE ACROSS NORTHEAST HALF WITH TEMPERATURES STRUGGLING
TO REBOUND TO 40 DEGREES AND LOW CLOUDS PERSISTING MOST OF THE DAY.
EVEN ACROSS SOUTHERN SECTIONS WHERE THE SUN SHOULD COME OUT BY
AFTERNOON HIGHS WILL ONLY REACH THE MID 40S AT BEST. A VERY COLD
NIGHT TONIGHT WITH LOWS IN THE LOWER TO MID 20S AND STILL SOME
PRESSURE GRADIENT SO WITH WINDS 5 TO 15 MPH IT WILL FEEL EVEN COLDER. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LARGE NE U.S VORTEX TAKING 
SHAPE IN THE EXTENDED. MODEL SOLUTIONS BEGIN TO SPREAD NEAR END OF 
EXTENDED. DESPITE MODEL DIFFERENCES...NORTHWEST FLOW AND COOL SPELL 
APPEARS REASONABLE WITH THIS PATTERN. BASIC CHANGES TO FORECAST WAS 
TO KNOCK TEMPS/DPS DOWN A COUPLE DEGREES. SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS IN 
FROM THE SW THU. SHORT WAVE DIG SSE THROUGH TN VLY AND S 
APPALACHIANS LATE THU EARLY FRI BRINGING SOME CLOUD COVER. SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE REINFORCED FROM THE NW. ANOTHER SHORT WAVE 
MOVES SE THROUGH NE TN/SW VA SAT. THIS FEATURE WILL BRING MORE 
MOISTURE AND DRAG A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE AREA. LIGHT SHOWERS WILL 
CHANGE TO SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS NE TN/SMOKIES/SW VA INTO SUN MORNING. 
COLD TEMPS AND DRY CONDITIONS WILL FOLLOW AND SHOULD PREVAIL INTO

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER 
SOUTHWEST VA...WITH A COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH FROM IT ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS. AREA RADARS REVEAL THE BACK EDGE OF 
THE RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH THIS FRONT OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU... 
WITH TEMPS BEGINNING TO FALL INTO THE 30S ON THE PLATEAU. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT MOST OF THIS LIGHT TO MODERATE RAIN WILL 
STAY AHEAD OF THE SUB-FREEZING AIR...BUT THIS SUB-FREEZING AIR MAY 
CATCH UP TO THE RAIN OVER SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST TN...AND THE 
MOUNTAINS WHERE A CHANGE-OVER TO SNOW MAY OCCUR BEFORE THE PRECIP 
FINALLY EXITS THE FORECAST AREA. IT STILL APPEARS THAT AROUND AN 
INCH OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THESE AREAS BEFORE 
SUNRISE...MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE THIS EVENING TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS TO THE PRECIP WORDING AND 
TEMPS ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

230 PM EST TUE NOV 30 2010

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...MAJOR SYSTEM CURRENTLY 
AFFECTING SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION CONTINUES TO SLOWLY PROGRESS 
EASTWARD. MAIN AXIS OF PRECIP CURRENTLY SHIFTING INTO THE CENTRAL 
ZONES AND IS EXPECTED TO SHIFT INTO THE EASTERN ZONES BY EARLY IN 
THE FIRST PERIOD. LINGERING PRECIP CURRENTLY DEPICTED ON RADAR IN 
MIDDLE TENNESSEE IN VICINITY OF FRONT. THUS EXPECT PRECIP TO LINGER 
INTO THE FIRST PERIOD ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH MUCH 
OF THE EVENING WITH PRECIP ENDING WEST TO EAST OVERNIGHT. TEMPS 
EXPECTED TO DROP QUICKLY AS FRONT SWEEPS THROUGH THE AREA. THUS 
PRECIP MAY END AS SNOW ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. HOWEVER... 
MOISTURE BEHIND FRONT DECREASES RAPIDLY...SO NO SIGNIFICANT SNOW 
ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED AT THIS TIME. PROJECTED WIND DIRECTION ALSO 
NOT IDEAL FOR UPSLOPE FLOW EVENT. DRY...ALBEIT MUCH COOLER 
CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR WEDNESDAY. WILL CANCEL HIGH WIND WARNING 
WITH ISSUANCE OF AFTERNOON PACKAGE AND REPLACE WITH ADVISORY AS
850 MB WINDS ARE PROJECTED TO CONTINUE TO DECREASE AND CONTINUE TO
SHIFT TO A SOUTHWESTERLY DIRECTION. FOR TEMPS...MAV/MET GUIDANCE
CLOSE AND LOOKS REASONABLE. GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV
VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE PRIMARY WEATHER FEATURE FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD WILL BE A 
CLOSED LOW THAT WILL BE NEARLY STATIONARY OVER NEW ENGLAND AND 
EASTERN CANADA...WITH A NORTHWEST FLOW OVER OUR AREA. THE 
GFS...ECMWF...AND CANADIAN MODELS AGREE ON THIS GENERAL 
PATTERN...THOUGH THE FINER DETAILS AND TIMING OF SHORTWAVES MOVING 
AROUND THE LOW ARE DIFFERENT AMONG THE MODELS. THE GFS APPEARS TO BE 
THE OUTLIER OF THE MODELS...AND HAS LITTLE SUPPORT FROM ITS ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS...SO WILL LEAN TOWARD THE ECMWF/CANADIAN SOLUTION.

THE FIRST SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO AFFECT THE AREA WILL PASS THROUGH ON 
THURSDAY NIGHT/FRIDAY. MOISTURE IS VERY LIMITED...AND SO WILL KEEP 
THE FORECAST DRY. 850-500 MB TEMPS FALL SLIGHTLY WITH THIS TROUGH 
PASSAGE...MAINLY IN NORTHERN SECTION...SO HIGHS WILL ONLY BE IN THE 
40S FOR MUCH OF THE AREA THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. A WEAK RIDGE WILL MEAN 
SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPS FOR SATURDAY BEFORE THE NEXT TROUGH ARRIVES ON 
SUNDAY. DEEPER MOISTURE AND A STRONGER POLAR JET STREAM OVER THE 
AREA WILL MEAN BETTER PRECIP CHANCES THAN THE FIRST TROUGH...MAINLY 
IN NORTHERN SECTIONS...FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. WILL HAVE JUST 
A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH DUE TO MODEL DISCREPANCIES. A SIGNIFICANT PUSH 
OF COLD AIR FOLLOWS THIS TROUGH FOR MONDAY AS A STRONG SURFACE HIGH 
MOVES FROM CENTRAL CANADA TO THE PLAINS. HIGHS WILL ONLY BE IN THE 
30S AND 40S FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY. CLOUDS MAY BE INCREASING ON 
TUESDAY IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING SOUTHERN STREAM LOW DEPICTED BY 
THE ECMWF.

TERM WEATHER. UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE EAST INTO SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
BY TONIGHT. STRONG MID LEVEL JET EAST OF TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH 
MIDDLE TN TODAY AND CONTINUE EAST WITH JET AXIS OVER SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS BY END OF PERIOD. LONG FETCHED N-S COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
EAST THROUGH MRX CWA TODAY. SURFACE WARM FRONT WILL MOVE NORTH INTO 
SOUTHERN MRX CWA BRIEFLY THIS MORNING. STRONG H85 JET AND GOOD 
MOISTURE TRANSPORT WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE AREA IN ADVANCE OF THE 
COLD FRONT. LOW LEVEL STABLE LAYER HINDERING PERSISTENT STRONG WINDS 
ACROSS VALLEY LOCATIONS PRESENTLY. WINDS EXPECTED TO MIX DOWN AND 
BECOME GUSTY IN NATURE WITH SPEEDS MEETING ADVISORY CRITERIA ACROSS 
MUCH OF THE MRX CWA. THE SET UP FOR A MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT HAS BEEN 
REALIZED AND WILL CONTINUE TODAY. RADAR AND SAT PICS INDICATE 
DOWNSLOPING SIGNATURES ALONG WEST SIDE OF SMOKIES. COVE MNT OBS HAS 
BEEN REPORTING GUSTS IN EXCESS OF 70 KTS OVERNIGHT. LOW LEVEL JET 
WILL REMAIN STRONG IN ADVANCE OF COLD FRONT INTO THE EARLY AFTN 
HOURS. SOLID LINE OF CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE IN ADVANCE OF FRONT 
AND WILL MARCH ACROSS MRX CWA TODAY. BULK SHEAR AND INCREASING PWS 
REMAIN MOST IMPRESSIVE FEATURES PROGGED TO ACCOMPANY LINE. HOURLY 
RAINFALL RATE BETWEEN .5-.75 WILL BE COMMON ALONG THE LINE. STORM 
TOTAL AMOUNTS UP TO TWO INCHES REMAINS LIKELY. MINOR FLOODING 
PROBLEMS CAN BE EXPECTED BUT WIDESPREAD FLOODING NOT ANTICIPATED.
HELICITY ALONG AND SOUTH OF WARM FRONT COULD AID IN DEVELOPMENT OF 
SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS OR ISOLATED TORNADOES BUT MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY 
SHOULD REMAIN S OF MRX CWA. MAX TEMPS MAY SPIKE BRIEFLY ALONG 
FOOTHILLS DUE TO DOWNSLOPING WINDS BUT OVERALL TEMPS MODERATED BY 
CLOUD COVER AND PCPN. POST FRONTAL WINDS WILL SHIFT TO THE WEST AND 
DECREASE BELOW ADVISORY AND WARNING LIMITS WILL REMAINING BREEZY 
FROM THE WEST. CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE IN THE EVENING HOURS MAINLY 
ACROSS EASTERN AREAS. STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION COMMENCES AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. TEMPS WILL FALL SHARPLY WITH FREEZING LEVEL DROPPING TO 
NEAR THE SURFACE BY DAYBREAK. MOISTURE WILL BE VERY LIMITED BY THIS 
TIME SO SNOWFALL NOT EXPECTED TO AMOUNT TO MUCH.   

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL BE EAST
OF THE APPALACHIANS EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING BUT UPPER TROUGH WILL
PASS ACROSS THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE
MORNING SO HAVE KEPT CHANCE OF LIGHT PRECIP WEDNESDAY MORNING.
UPSLOPE FLOW WITH STRONG COLD ADVECTION AT THE LOWER LEVELS MAY
KEEP SNOW SHOWERS THROUGH THE MORNING ESPECIALLY IN THE
MOUNTAINS...BUT WITH LITTLE ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATION AS DRY AIR
ALOFT MOVES IN BEHIND THE COLD FRONT BY AFTERNOON. SKIES SHOULD
CLEAR MOST OTHER AREAS OUTSIDE NORTHERN MOUNTAINS WEDNESDAY BUT
BECAUSE OF COLD AIR ADVECTION WILL RISE ONLY 5 TO 10 DEGREES FROM
MORNING LOWS. BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT BROAD UPPER TROUGH OVER FORECAST
AREA WITH FLOW FROM THE NW AND WINDS DYING DOWN WILL ALLOW
TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE 20S AREA WIDE...EVEN COLDER TEENS IN
THE MOUNTAINS. THURSDAY HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO THE SOUTH AND
WEAK SYSTEM IN NW FLOW WILL KEEP SOME CLOUDS OVER REGION BUT WARMER
TEMPERATURES. FRIDAY ABOUT THE SAME TEMPERATURES BUT A LITTLE MORE
SUN AS WEAK SYSTEM PASSES TO EAST. SATURDAY A NEW SYSTEM APPROACHES
FROM THE WEST AND NORTHWEST SO WILL INTRODUCE LOW POPS WITH COLD
AIR CHANGING RAIN TO SNOW SATURDAY NIGHT. SUNDAY AND MONDAY TROUGH
DEEPENS ACROSS THE EAST BEHIND SATURDAY SYSTEM. VARIABLE CLOUDINESS

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
MS RIVER VALLEY...WITH LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
NORTHEAST PRODUCING A COLD AIR DAMMING SCENARIO OVER THE CAROLINAS. 
THE RESULTING TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS WAS 
PRODUCING A STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 50 KT) OVER THE REGION...WHICH 
IS PROGGED TO FURTHER STRENGTHEN UP TO AROUND 70 TO 75 KT AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. EARLIER OBSERVATIONS FROM THE NOAA WIND TOWER AT CAMP 
CREEK IN SOUTHEAST GREENE COUNTY REPORTED WIND GUSTS UP TO 74 MPH... 
WITH THE COVE MOUNTAIN WIND TOWER IN THE NATIONAL PARK REPORTING 
WIND GUSTS UP TO 54 MPH. EARLIER SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALED SOME 
NARROW BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER PARALLEL WITH THE SPINE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVE ACTIVITY...BUT CURRENT IMAGERY 
SHOWS HIGH CLOUDS OBSCURING THESE NARROW BREAKS. OVERALL...HIGH WIND 
WARNING FOR THE MOUNTAIN AND THEIR IMMEDIATE FOOTHILLS APPEARS TO BE 
ON TRACK...AND EXPECT THESE WINDS TO FURTHER INTENSIFY OVERNIGHT 
WITH GUSTS POSSIBLY UP TO 80 OR 90 MPH AFTER MIDNIGHT. ELSEWHERE... 
WINDS SHOULD GRADUALLY BECOME BREEZY IN THE VALLEY AREAS...WITH THE 
ADVISORY-CRITERIA WINDS (IN EXCESS OF 25 MPH) MAINLY CONFINED TO THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SOME OF STRONGER SHOWERS THAT ARE ABLE TO PULL 
DOWN SOME OF THE STRONG 850 MB WINDS INTO THE VALLEY AREAS. 

AREA RADARS REVEAL A LARGE AREA OF RAIN SPREADING NORTHEAST ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING...BUT THINK THAT DOWNSLOPING 
SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS SHOULD LIMIT THE AMOUNT OF RAINFALL OVER THE 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEY AREAS TONIGHT AND INTO TUESDAY MORNING. 
THUS...WHILE RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF ONE TO TWO INCHES MAY OCCUR 
OVERNIGHT ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC (WITH STORM TOTALS OF 
TWO TO THREE INCHES BY TUESDAY NIGHT)...WILL NOT PLAN TO ISSUE A 
FLOOD WATCH WITH THIS SYSTEM SINCE FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES ARE 
RELATIVELY HIGH (FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR) AND THIS RAINFALL SHOULD 
OCCUR OVER SEVERAL HOURS. HOWEVER...WILL PLAN TO MENTION 'RAINFALL 
MAY HEAVY AT TIMES' WORDING IN THE FORECAST. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL 
SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY DEVELOPING ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN LATER 
TONIGHT...SO WILL PLAN TO MENTION SOME TSTORMS IN THE FORECAST FOR 
THESE AREAS. WILL ALSO PLAN TO MAKE SOME TWEAKS TO THE TEMP FORECAST 
FOR TONIGHT DUE TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

ON TUESDAY...AM BECOMING INCREASINGLY CONCERNED WITH THE PROSPECTS 
FOR DAMAGING WINDS WITH A POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE LINE DEVELOPING ALONG 
THE COLD FRONT DURING THE AFTER SUNRISE HOURS OF THE MORNING. NAM 
MODEL CONTINUES TO INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME WEAK INSTABILITY 
DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT...WHICH MAY ONLY RESULT IN A LINE OF 
SHOWERS ALONG THE FRONT. HOWEVER...WITH A STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 
60 TO 70 KT) IN PLACE AND THE LOW-LEVEL STABLE LAYER EXPECTED TO 
HAVE ERODED AWAY AFTER SUNRISE...THINK THAT SOME OF THESE UPPER- 
LEVEL STRONG WINDS MAY BE PULLED DOWN TO THE SURFACE WITH THESE 
SHOWERS. ALSO...WITH SUCH STRONG WIND DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM 
(RESULTING IN HIGH HELICITY VALUES)...EVEN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME 
MINOR INSTABILITY MAY BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW SUPERCELLS AND/OR 
ISOLATED TORNADOES. THIS POSSIBILITY OF SOME WEAK INSTABILITY 
APPEARS TO MAINLY BE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN DURING LATE MORNING HOURS. 
WILL PLAN TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS IN A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT 
AND IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK. WILL ALSO PLAN TO MAKE SOME 
CHANGES TO THE TEMP FORECAST FOR TOMORROW...SINCE THE STRONG 
DOWNSLOPING SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS SHOULD CAUSE TEMPS TO RISE SEVERAL 
DEGREES ABOVE THE MOS GUIDANCE VALUES ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN AREAS OF THE GREAT TN VALLEY.

.AVIATION...POWERFUL STORM SYSTEM MAKING ITS WAY INTO THE EASTERN
U.S. THIS EVENING WITH NARROW AREA OF SHOWERS CONTAINING MODERATE
TO EVEN HEAVY RAIN AT TIMES. STRONG LOW LEVEL JET REQUIRES USE OF
LLWS DURING THE EVENT. THIS JET IS SCOURING OUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
AT TYS AND TRI LEAVING CEILINGS AT SEVEN THOUSAND FEET OR HIGHER
HERE. IT WILL BE INTERESTING TO SEE WHAT IMPACT THE BAND OF SHOWERS
MOVING RAPIDLY NORTHEAST AT THESE TERMINALS. SUSPECT THERE WOULD BE
VERY LITTLE IMPACT AT TRI DUE TO THE LONG FETCH ACROSS MOUNTAIN
TERRAIN HERE. MAIN BAND OF SHOWERS WITH MODERATE RAINFALL WILL MOVE
INTO CHA AROUND 12Z TYS AROUND 14Z AND TRI BY 17Z WITH WESTERLY
FLOW FILLING IN BEHIND FRONT WITH IMPROVEMENT IN VSBY AND CEILING

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
230 PM EST MON NOV 29 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MAJOR SYSTEM CURRENTLY 
DEVELOPING OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS WILL CONTINUE TO HEAD EAST 
EXERTING INCREASING INFLUENCE ON THE FORECAST AREA AS IT PROGRESSES. 
CONDITIONS STILL APPEAR GENERALLY FAVORABLE FOR MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT 
WITH LOW-LEVEL FLOW APPROACHING 70 KNOTS...SURFACE-BASED INVERSION 
TO AROUND 850 MB AND VEERING WIND PROFILE. WILL UPGRADE HIGH WIND 
WATCH TO A WARNING AND INCLUDE REMAINDER OF FORECAST AREA IN WIND 
ADVISORY. ANOTHER FACET OF THIS EVENT IS POTENTIAL FOR SIGNIFICANT 
RAINFALL WITH QPFS APPROACHING TWO INCHES GENERALLY. WILL HOLD OFF 
ON ISSUING ANY FLOOD PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME AS MOST OF RAINFALL IS 
EXPECTED TO OCCUR DURING SECOND PERIOD BUT CAN'T TOTALLY RULE OUT
POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING IN SOME LOCATIONS. TEMPS CONTINUE TO BE
PROBLEMATIC IN DOWNSLOPE FLOW REGIME. TENDED TO FAVOR A BLEND OF
THE GUIDANCE VALUES OVERNIGHT WHILE STAYING CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE
IN THE SECOND PERIOD.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE PRIMARY SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL PASS THROUGH THE AREA DURING THE 
TUESDAY NIGHT PERIOD. THE FRONT SHOULD PUSH MOST OF THE SIGNIFICANT 
PRECIP OUT OF THE AREA BY 12Z. HOWEVER THE PASSAGE OF THE UPPER 
TROUGH LAGS THE FRONT BY SEVERAL HOURS...SO THERE MAY BE A PERIOD OF 
LIGHT PRECIP WEDNESDAY MORNING. UPSLOPLE FLOW AND STRONG COLD 
ADVECTION AT 850 MB MAY RESULT IN A PERIOD OF SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS 
LATE TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY MORNING...BUT WITH LITTLE 
ACCUMULATION EXPECTED AS VERY DRY AIR ALOFT MOVES IN BY WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON BEHIND THE UPPER TROUGH. 

FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...A BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL BE 
OVER THE EASTERN SEABOARD...WITH THE POLAR JET LOCATED FROM 
MINNESOTA TO THE CAROLINAS. THIS WILL KEEP PARTLY TO MOSTLY SUNNY 
SKIES AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ACROSS OUR AREA. A BUILDING 
RIDGE IN THE PROGRESSIVE PATTERN WILL MEAN A SLIGHT WARMING TREND 
FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. A FAST-MOVING SHORTWAVE TROUGH MAY BRING 
ADDITIONAL CLOUDS FOR SUNDAY...BUT MOISTURE LOOKS TOO LIMITED FOR 
PRECIP. THE UPPER JET STRENGTHENS AND PUSHES SOUTHWARD AGAIN FOR 
MONDAY AS A CLOSED LOW DROPS OVER THE GREAT LAKES...ACCORDING TO THE 
GFS. THE 00Z ECMWF SHOWS THE CLOSED LOW MUCH FARTHER 
SOUTH...RESULTING IN SNOW OVER OUR ENTIRE AREA. CONSIDERABLE SPREAD 
AMONG GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SUGGESTS TAKING THE MORE CAUTIOUS ROUTE 
AT THIS POINT. WILL START MONDAY OFF DRY BUT WITH FALLING TEMPS AND 
INCREASING CLOUDS.

THROUGH NATIONS MID SECTION. PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS BETWEEN LOW 
AND STOUT RIDGE OVER NE U.S. H85 JET DEVELOPS OVER CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU TODAY AND INCREASES TONIGHT TO NEAR 75 KTS. FLOW SOMEWHAT 
LESS AND SOUTHEASTERLY ACROSS THE SMOKIES. THIS SETS UP WELL FOR 
DOWNSLOPING WINDS ACROSS THE FOOTHILLS INTO TUESDAY. MAX TEMPS ALONG 
THE FOOTHILLS COULD EXPERIENCE A BIG JUMP THIS AFTERNOON AND MAY BE 
UNDERDONE. NAM MODEL MOS POPS LOOK OVERDONE AND EXPECT PCPN TO MOVE 
INTO SW AREA LATER THIS AFTN. STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION COMMENCES IN 
THE H85-H70 LAYER TONIGHT. PCPN SHOULD BECOME WIDESPREAD BY LATE 
TONIGHT. LAYER SHEAR IS MODERATELY STRONG BUT INSTABILITY IS LACKING 
AS SFC WARM FRONT HANGS SOUTH OF THE AREA. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS SOUTHERN AND WESTERN AREAS INTO TUESDAY MORNING. 
SEVERE PARAMETERS APPEAR LIMITED AT THIS TIME. STRONG WINDS CONTINUE 
TUESDAY MORNING AND PWS INCREASE TO NEAR 1.50 ACROSS SOUTHERN AREAS. 
WESTERN AND SOUTHERN AREAS COULD SEE SOME MINOR FLOODING. SURFACE 
COLD FRONT SWINGS THROUGH MRX CWA TUESDAY AND TEMPS WILL LIKELY FALL 
IN THE AFTN EXCEPT FOR NE AREAS. UPPER TROUGH BECOMES NEGATIVELY 
TILTED AND MOVES NE THROUGH THE AREA. AVAILABLE MOISTURE DROPS AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. FREEZING LEVEL WILL DROP TO NEAR 2500 FEET BY LATE TUESDAY 
NIGHT SO ANY ONGOING PCPN WILL SWITCH TO SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. INITIAL GROUND TEMPS SHOULD HINDER SIGNIFICANT 
ACCUMULATIONS. 

..LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...COLD FRONT WILL BE PULLING 
AWAY FROM THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY...BUT STILL EXPECTED TO SEE SOME 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE GENERATING A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS OVER FAR

WELL...A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW IS EXPECTED OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  WILL 
MOVE INTO A QUIET WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE REST OF THE EXTENDED AS

855 PM EST SUN NOV 28 2010

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC REGION...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
DEVELOPING IN THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES. CURRENT INFRARED SATELLITE 
IMAGERY REVEALS SOME LOW CLOUDS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP OVER SOUTHEAST 
GA...AND THESE LOW CLOUDS ARE EXPECTED TO EXPAND NORTHWARD OVERNIGHT 
TOWARDS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC BY SUNRISE. CURRENT FORECAST 
OF SKY CONDITIONS AND TEMPS FOR TONIGHT APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK. 
HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THAT CONDITIONS WILL SLOWLY BECOME FAVORABLE 
FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF MOUNTAIN WAVES ALONG THE FOOTHILLS OF THE 
MOUNTAINS LATER TONIGHT INTO MONDAY. MODELS INDICATE THAT WINDS WILL 
BECOME SOUTHEASTERLY LATER TONIGHT...AND SLOWLY INCREASE ON 
MONDAY...ESPECIALLY AT THE 850 MB LEVEL. WITH A SURFACE-BASED 
INVERSION IN PLACE...EXPECT ADVISORY-CRITERIA WINDS AROUND THE 
MOUNTAINS AND THEIR FOOTHILLS. THUS...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WIND 
ADVISORY FOR THESE AREAS BEGINNING LATE TONIGHT AND CONTINUING INTO 
EARLY MONDAY EVENING.

...OUTLOOK FOR MAJOR SYSTEM ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...

MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT CONDITIONS WILL BECOME 
FAVORABLE FOR THE DEVELOPMENT OF HIGH WINDS DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVES BY 
LATE MONDAY EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. NAM MODEL INDICATES 
THAT A VERY STRONG (70 TO 75 KT) SOUTHEASTERLY 850 MB JET OVER THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY WILL APPROACH THE MOUNTAINS BY LATE MONDAY EVENING 
AND INTO TUESDAY. IN ADDITION...MODEL SOUNDINGS LOCATED UPSTREAM OF 
THE MOUNTAINS REVEAL A SURFACE-BASED INVERSION EXTENDING UP TO 
AROUND 800 MB...AND A STRONG VEERING WIND PROFILE THAT INCREASES 
WITH HEIGHT. THUS...IT APPEARS THAT A HIGH END WIND EVENT DUE TO 
MOUNTAIN WAVES WILL BE POSSIBLE ALONG THE FOOTHILLS BY LATE MONDAY 
EVENING THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL ISSUE A 
HIGH WIND WATCH FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND THEIR IMMEDIATE FOOTHILLS. THE 
BOUNDARY LAYER WINDS SHOULD GRADUALLY BECOME SOUTHWESTERLY BY 
TUESDAY AFTERNOON...WITH THE LOW-LEVEL STABLE LAYER ERODING AWAY AS 
WELL. THUS...WILL HAVE THE HIGH WIND WATCH END AT NOON ON TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...POTENT COLD FRONT NOW 
EXITING FORECAST AREA VIA THE MOUNTAINS LONG NC LINE. STRONG 
PRESSURE GRADIENT AHEAD OF FRONT PRODUCED WIND GUSTS INTO ADVISORY 
CRITERIA...BUT GRADIENT BEHIND FRONT IS LESS TIGHT AND SO WINDS HAVE 
DROPPED OFF TO MERELY GUSTY AT TIMES AND WILL ALLOW WIND ADVISORY 
FOR MOUNTAINS TO EXPIRE NORMALLY WITH FORECAST ISSUANCE. 

OTHER ISSUE AT HAND IS LARGE BUT MOTTELY RAIN SHIELD OVER AREA. THE 
AREA IS MOVING EAST MORE SLOWLY THAN THE RAIN ELEMENTS ARE MOVING 
NORTHEAST WITHIN IN IT. THE COLD AIR BEHIND THE FRONT PRODUCED SOME 
MOMENTARY LIGHT SNOW IN NORTHWEST TN DURING THE NIGHT. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS SHOW A NEARLY SATURATED COLUMN TO ABOUT 700 MB WITH TEMPS 
MAINLY BELOW FREEZING. BELIEVE THIS WILL AFFECT MAINLY THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU AND POSSIBLE LEE AND WISE COUNTIES IN VA, SO HAVE INCLUDED 
ISOLATED MIXED RW/SW IN THOSE AREAS FOR THIS MORNING. THE CLOUD 
SHIELD WILL MOVE QUICKLY ACROSS THE AREA AND BACK EDGE WILL 
GRADUALLY MOVE OUT OF THE REGION TODAY PROVIDING INCREASINGLY SUNNY 
SKIES LATER TODAY BUT TEMPS WILL DROP LIKE A ROCK AND THE HIGHS HAVE 
ALREADY OCCURRED FOR THE DAY. AFTERNOON TEMPS WILL NOT EXCEED THE 
40S AND THERE WILL STILL BE A BIT OF BREEZINESS MAKING BLACK FRIDAY 
A BIT RAW. 

OVERNIGHT TEMPS WILL PLUMMET TO THE 20S MOST AREAS IN COLD 
ADVECTION, WITH TEENS IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN AS SKIES CLEAR AND 
WINDS DIE DOWN A BIT. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
REGION WILL KEEP THINGS DRY AND COOL FOR THE WEEKEND.  A FEW SHOWERS 
OUT AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING FRONT MAY REACH INTO OUR WESTERN 
COUNTIES LATE MONDAY.  THE MAIN BAND OF SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.  THE UPPER LOW

.AVIATION...THE TERMINALS MAY BE ABLE TO STAY VFR THROUGHOUT A
LARGE PORTION OF THE FORECAST VALID TIME TODAY DESPITE THE RATHER
STRONG STORM SYSTEM CURRENTLY MAKING PROGRESS TOWARD THE MID SOUTH.
THE WARM FRONT IS BLASTING ITS WAY NORTHEAST ACROSS THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY AND THE LOW DECK AT CHA HAS BROKEN. MIXING IN THE WELL ABOVE
NORMAL AIRMASS EXPECTED TODAY SHOULD KEEP FLIGHT VFR HERE WHILE A
DOWNSLOPING COMPONENT TO THE LOW LEVEL FLOW MAY ALLOW CEILINGS AT TYS
AND TRI TO STAY VFR. THE LOW LEVEL JET ABOVE A LIGHT SURFACE WIND
WILL REQUIRE THE USE OF LLWS AT THE SITES FOR THE FIRST FEW HOURS
UNTIL SURFACE WINDS STRENGTHEN. FRONTAL TIMING WITH MVFR/IFR FLIGHT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...WARM FRONT HAS MOVED 
NORTH ACROSS AREA AND WE ARE IN WARM SECTOR NOW WITH TIGHTENING 
SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT. WINDS WILL PICK UP STEADILY FROM SOUTH TO 
SOUTHWEST WHICH WILL KEEP THINGS WARM AND A BIT HUMID TODAY. HIGH RH 
ALOFT WILL ALSO TEND TO KEEP MOSTLY CLOUDY TO OVERCAST SKIES IN 
PLACE THROUGH TONIGHT. 

EXPECT WINDS TO INCREASE INTO TONIGHT AS STRONG COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES FROM WEST. FRONTOGENISIS WITH THIS FEATURE ARE IMPRESSIVE 
AND WINDS WILL APPROACH LAKE WIND ADVISORY CRITERIA, BUT FOR NOW 
WILL KEEP "BREEZY" WORDING IN ZONES FORECASTS. WILL CONSIDER LWA 
LATER THIS MORNING IF THINGS PICK UP. MAIN AREAS TO WATCH WILL BE 
HIGHER TERRAIN AS 50KT+ LLJ MOVES INTO AREA. 

H7 OMEGA IS ALSO MODERATE BUT THIS IS GOING TO MAINLY FROM LOW LEVEL 
FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT AND SOME WEAK SPEED CONVERGENCE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE LLJ. HENCE, SHOWERS TURNING TO RAIN OVER NIGHT, 
TAPERING OFF LATER FRIDAY. NO THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED. 

FRONT WILL MOVE QUICKLY THROUGH AREA AND COLD ADVECTION BEHIND FRONT 
WILL BE A RUDE AWAKENING AFTER THIS WARM MUGGY PERIOD. BACK TO 
AUTUMN. IT IS ALMOST DECEMBER, AFTER ALL.

AFTER FROPA FRIDAY LATE-ISH, DRIER AIR ADVECTS IN AND SKIES BEGIN TO 
CLEAR FRIDAY NIGHT. 

WENT WITH A MAV/MET BLEND ON THE TEMPS THROUGH PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FORECAST AREA WILL BE IN 
BETWEEN WEATHER SYSTEMS OVER THE WEEKEND WITH WEST NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW ALOFT TRANSITIONING TO THE SOUTHWEST BY THE BEGINNING OF THE 
WORK WEEK. SUNSHINE WILL RETURN UNDER THE STRENGTHENING RIDGE 
SURFACE AND ALOFT BUT TEMPERATURES WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES BELOW 
NORMAL EVEN WITH THE INSOLATION ON SATURDAY. BY SUNDAY TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD REBOUND BACK TO NORMAL. UPPER TROF BUILDS EAST INTO THE 
MIDDLE PART OF THE NATION ON MONDAY WITH MOISTURE ON THE INCREASE 
AHEAD OF ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. LOWERED POPS ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA ON MONDAY WHILE KEEPING LIKELY TO MEDIUM CHANCE FROM WEST TO 
EAST MONDAY NIGHT. FRONT MOVES ACROSS THE REGION ON TUESDAY SO KEPT 
LIKELY POPS FOR SHOWERS AREAWIDE AT THIS TIME. MODELS SHOWED BETTER 
AGREEMENT ON ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE ENERGY DROPPING INTO THE BACK OF 
THE DEPARTING UPPER TROF TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY SO HELD ONTO 
CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS DURING THIS PERIOD. LATER WEDNESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS COLDER AIR STREAMS SOUTHEAST...SOME OF THE RAIN 
MAY MIX WITH OR CHANCE TO SNOW...MAINLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

EVENING.

HOWEVER...WORSE AVIATION CONDITIONS FORMING RATHER QUICKLY AGAIN AT 
CHA...WHERE CEILING WAS ALREADY BELOW 2000 FEET. WARM FRONT TO THE 
SOUTH OF CHA COULD PRODUCE A SPOTTY LIGHT SHOWER OVERNIGHT...BUT 
MAIN PROBLEMS WILL BE LOWERING CEILING/VISBY THERE...LIKELY TO BELOW 
IFR CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT.

VFR CONDITIONS EXPECTED FOR TRI DUE TO THE ENCROACHING LOW TO MID 
DECK CLOUD LAYER (WHICH WILL INHIBIT FOG)...WHILE TYS COULD SEE MVFR 
CONDITIONS DUE TO LOWERING VISBY AS PATCHY FOG DEVELOPS.

BREEZY SOUTHERLY WINDS...AHEAD OF THE SLOW DOWNED COLD FRONT...
SHOULD HELP PRODUCE VFR CONDITIONS ON THANKSGIVING DAY. SHOWERS LOOK

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FORECAST AREA SHOULD ENJOY A MILD 
LATE NOVEMBER DAY TODAY AS THE SOURCE REGION FEEDING THE LOCAL 
ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES TO BE THE PACIFIC OCEAN. HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL 
BE ABOUT TEN DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL FOR MOST LOCATIONS. THE DAY WILL 
START OUT A LITTLE ON THE FOGGY SIDE. DENSE FOG ADVISORY WAS ISSUED 
TUESDAY EVENING AS THE SURFACE SATURATED RATHER EASILY DUE TO THE 
SOAKED GROUND AND LOSS OF MID DECK. VISIBILITY AND CEILING HAVE BEEN 
BOUNCING AROUND FOR A FEW HOURS WITH THE APPEARANCE OF A GENERAL 
IMPROVING TREND IN THE SATURATED NEAR SURFACE LAYER AS DRIER AIR 
FILTERS INTO THE REGION FROM THE NORTH. LARGE DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS 
NOTED ON THE NORTHWEST EDGE OF THE FORECAST AREA ON THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU SO REMOVED THIS AREA FROM THE ADVISORY. 11-3.9 MICRON 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS FOG STILL PREVALENT ACROSS LARGE SECTIONS 
OF THE FORECAST AREA AND DESPITE SOME IMPROVEMENT...FOG ADVISORY 
ALREADY IN PLACE AND STILL A FEW HOURS OF RADIATION LEFT BEFORE 
SUNRISE FOR TIGHTENING DEWPOINT DEPRESSION. THEREFORE WILL LEAVE THE 
ADVISORY AS IS. WARM FRONT WILL BE APPROACHING THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS TODAY WITH ARRIVAL TONIGHT. MODELS INDICATE BEST 
MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE TONIGHT AND EVEN THEN...NOT MUCH TO GET 
EXCITED ABOUT. THEREFORE...REMOVED POPS FOR SHOWERS TODAY AND KEPT 
AT SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SOUTHERN AND WESTERN SECTIONS TONIGHT WHEN THE 
BOUNDARY RETURNS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE CWA WILL BE SOLIDLY IN 
THE WARM SECTOR ON THURSDAY...ALLOWING TEMPS TO WARM INTO THE UPPER 
60S TO LOWER 70S IN MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. THERE APPEARS TO BE VERY 
LITTLE LIFTING MECHANISMS FOR PRECIP ON THURSDAY...AND MOS GUIDANCE 
SHOWS SINGLE-DIGIT POPS...SO WILL REMOVE PRECIP FROM THURSDAY. 
MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT PRECIP WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL THURSDAY 
NIGHT...MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. A STRONG 850 MB JET...NEAR 50 
KTS...WILL BE OVER THE AREA AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING COLD FRONT 
THURSDAY NIGHT...AND EXPECT THAT WIND ADVISORIES WILL BE NEEDED IN 
THE MOUNTAINS WITH FUTURE UPDATES. THE STRONGEST LIFT WITH THE FRONT 
AND UPPER TROUGH CROSS THROUGH AROUND 12Z FRIDAY...AND MODELS SEEM 
TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THIS. WILL RAISE POPS TO CATEGORICAL LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT AND INTO FRIDAY MORNING. DRIER AIR ARRIVES QUICKLY 
BEHIND THE FRONT/UPPER TROUGH...AND WILL END ALL RAIN CHANCES BY 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON. STRONG COLD ADVECTION WILL RESULT IN TEMPERATURES 
FALLING THROUGH THE DAY. THERE APPEARS TO BE ENOUGH OF A TIME LAG 
BETWEEN THE EXIT OF MOISTURE AND ONSET OF FREEZING TEMPS TO REMOVE 
THE MENTION OF SNOW IN THE MOUNTAINS. 

SATURDAY AND SUNDAY WILL FEATURE DRY CONDITIONS WITH CLEAR SKIES 
UNDER A BUILDING RIDGE ALOFT. TEMPS GRADUALLY WARM FROM HIGHS IN THE 
UPPER 40S TO MID 50S ON SATURDAY...TO UPPER 50S TO MID 60S BY MONDAY 
AS A DEEP S-SW FLOW DEVELOPS BEHIND THE RIDGE AXIS. A CLOSED LOW 
TRACKING ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND GREAT LAKES WILL BRING 
ANOTHER STRONG COLD FRONT TO THE AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT/TUESDAY. THERE 
IS REASONABLE AGREEMENT AMONG GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS WITH THIS 
TIMING...THOUGH THE ECMWF IS SLOWER THAN THE GFS. WILL RAISE POPS TO 
A HIGH CHANCE FOR THIS EVENT.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...THE COLD FRONT AND ASSOCIATED 
CONVECTIVE SHOWERS WILL PUSH OUT OF THE AREA THIS EVENING FOR 
IMPROVING CONDITIONS OVERNIGHT.  THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO STALL TO 
OUR SOUTH AND EAST...THEN BEGIN TO LIFT BACK INTO THE AREA AS A WARM 
FRONT.  TIMING OF THIS REMAINS A QUESTION...BUT SHOULD SEE CLOUDS 
INCREASE AND POSSIBLY SOME INITIAL SHOWERS BY LATE IN THE DAY 
WEDNESDAY. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS COMING INTO 
BETTER AGREEMENT ON TIMING OF LONGWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT FOR LATE THANKSGIVING DAY INTO FRIDAY...WITH MY GRIDS DRAWN IN 
LINE WITH A GFS/ECMWF BLEND (NAM SLOWEST AND NOT PREFERRED). 
THUS...POPS WERE CUT BACK SHARPLY FOR THURSDAY WITH THURSDAY NIGHT'S 
LIKELY POPS CONTINUED. COLD AIR ARRIVES GENERALLY IN THE 12Z TO 16Z 
TIME PERIOD FRIDAY...AND THERE IS NO WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE...SO SNOW 
SHOWERS WILL BE LIMITED TO HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND NE TN. 
LIKELY TOO WARM FOR ANY SNOW SHOWERS UNTIL LATER IN THE DAY FOR THE 
SMOKIES...BUT I DID NUDGE POPS UP TO LIKELY IN OUR FAR ERN COUNTIES 
ON FRIDAY DUE TO THE SLOWER TIMING. 

PREVIOUS TEMP GRIDS WITH SLOWLY FALLING TEMPS LOOKED VERY GOOD. OTHER
ITEM OF CONCERN WILL BE WINDS ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING... 
GIVEN STRENGTH OF THE LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY JET. LET PRECIPITATION MIX 
WITH SNOW SHOWERS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...AS TEMPS FALL...BUT WON'T 
HIT SNOW AMOUNTS VERY HARD FOR NOW...SINCE THIS IS A 6TH PERIOD 
EVENT.

DRY WEATHER RETURNS FOR THE WEEKEND COURTESY OF RIDGING...THEN UPPER 
TROUGH MOVES EAST FROM THE PLAINS ON MONDAY...AND SOUTHERLY LOW

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
EXTRAPOLATION BRINGS THE CONVECTIVE LINE MOVING INTO MIDDLE TN TO 
OUR CUMBERLAND PLATEAU COUNTIES AROUND 12Z...AND TO A TRI-TYS LINE 
AROUND 15Z. EXPECT THE LIGHTNING ACTIVITY TO DIMINSH AS IT 
APPROACHES...BUT WILL STILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
THROUGH THE MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON AS MODELS DO SHOW SOME WEAK 
INSTABILITY. BREEZY CONDITIONS CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED THIS MORNING 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT...BUT WINDS SHOULD STAY BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA 
IN MOST SPOTS. THE CONVECTIVE LINE AND COLD FRONT MOVE THROUGH 
QUICKLY...SO POPS WILL BE DECREASING BY THE AFTERNOON. THE FRONT 
STALLS JUST SOUTH OF THE AREA TONIGHT AS THE FLOW ALOFT BECOMES 
NEARLY ZONAL. A DRIER/COOLER AIR MASS BEHIND THE FRONT WILL ALLOW 
TEMPS TO DROP INTO THE 30S TO LOWER 40S TONIGHT UNDER MOSTLY CLEAR 
SKIES. 

A BUILDING RIDGE ALONG THE EAST COAST AND LOW PRESSURE MOVING ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL PUSH THE FRONT BACK TO THE NORTH LATE 
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THIS WARM FRONTAL PASSAGE MAY BRING A 
FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE CWA WILL BE SOLIDLY IN THE 
WARM SECTOR FOR THURSDAY...GIVING TEMPS IN THE 60S TO NEAR 70 SOUTH. 
WHILE THE GFS AND ECMWF INDICATE THAT THE BULK OF THE PRECIP WITH AN 
APPROACHING FRONT WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL THURSDAY NIGHT...WILL HAVE 
JUST CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON AS 
PRE-FRONTAL SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE WARM SECTOR.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
MORE INFLUENTIAL UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL DRIVE
TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. THERE WILL BE
A HIGH LIKELIHOOD OF SHOWERS THURSDAY NIGHT WITH POPS TAPERING A
BIT ON FRIDAY AS THE COLD FRONT PUSHES EAST OF THE HIGHER TERRAIN
ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. TIMING OF THE FROPA NOT CERTAIN AT
THIS TIME RANGE BUT WENT CLOSER TO THE SLOWER ECMWF DEPICTION. IT
WILL BE A RACE TO SEE IF THE COLDER AIR CAN BUILD INTO THE REGION
SOON ENOUGH PRIOR TO THE DEPARTURE OF THE MOIST AXIS FOR THE
POSSIBILITY OF A FEW SNOW SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS. THERE COULD BE
A FEW FLAKES IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN LATER IN THE AFTERNOON BEFORE
THE PRECIP SHUTS OFF WITH MUCH DRIER AIR FLOWING INTO THE REGION.
DRY NORTHWEST TRAJECTORY CONTINUES THROUGH SUNDAY ALLOWING FOR A
BETTER WEEKEND COMPLETE WITH SUNSHINE. TEMPERATURES OVER THE
WEEKEND WILL BE NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL IN THIS REGIME. BY
MONDAY THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMES SOUTHWESTERLY AGAIN AS ANOTHER
UPPER LEVEL TROUGH APPROACHES. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER
LATER MONDAY AFTERNOON INTO MONDAY NIGHT AS ISENTROPIC LIFTING
STRENGTHENS AHEAD OF YET ANOTHER MID WEEK FRONTAL SYSTEM.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...WILL SEE A PATTERN

AWAY FROM THE AREA AS A COLD FRONT APPROACHES.  CLOUDS WILL INCREASE 
OVERNIGHT IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT.  CLOUD COVER WILL KEEP 
TEMPERATURES UP A BIT.  THEN...A LINE OF CONVECTIVE SHOWERS WILL

TUESDAY.  EXPECTED A FEW RESIDUAL SHOWERS WILL LINGER INTO THE 
EVENING HOURS...WITH IMPROVING CONDITIONS EXPECTED OVERNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...TRICKY FORECAST FOR MID WEEK 
THROUGH FRIDAY GIVEN MODEL DIFFERENCES. I THINK THAT SOME LIGHT 
SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY AS WARM FRONT LIFTS NORTH...BUT 
MAINLY TO OUR WEST AND ACROSS NRN MOST PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
DEEPER TROUGH AND STRONGER COLD FRONT HAVE BEEN SLOWED DOWN...WITH 
NAM THE SLOWEST. HPC PREFERS A NON-NAM SOLUTION...WHICH LENDS 
SUPPORT TO THE GFS AND/OR ECMWF...THUS POPS WERE ADJUSTED DOWN FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THANKSGIVING DAY. SHOWERS SHOULD SPREAD INTO 
WRN MOST AREAS BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...AND I DID ALSO ADD A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF TSTMS. BLENDED INTO OHX AND JKL LIKELY POPS FOR THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON...THEN WENT LOWER END OF LIKELY (SHOWERS) FOR THURSDAY 
NIGHT...PREFERRING NOT TO GO ANY HIGHER JUST YET FOR THAT FAR OUT. 

COLDER AIR ARRIVES FRIDAY MORNING...AND PRECIPITATION MAY LINGER 
LONG ENOUGH FOR A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ON 
FRIDAY. FORECAST GRIDS REFLECT THIS...BUT TOO FAR OUT FOR MUCH 
DETAIL TO SHOW UP IN THE TEXT PRODUCTS AT THIS TIME. LATER SHIFTS 
CAN WATCH MODELS FOR CONTINUITY AND DETERMINE IF A GREATER CHANCE OF 
SNOW IS JUSTIFIED...AND HIGHLIGHT AS NEEDED. 

UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN FOR THE WEEKEND WITH SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW 
RETURNING ON MONDAY...AND A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS FOR NOW ON NEW 
DAY 7. SLIGHT TEMP ADJUSTMENTS MADE IN LINE WITH LATEST GFS/NAM/GFSX

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC... 
WITH A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE MID WEST. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE A MID LEVEL INVERSION LINGERING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING...WHICH SHOULD LIMIT ANY 
VERTICAL MIXING OF THE MOISTURE TRAPPED BENEATH IT. THUS...WILL PLAN 
TO BE MORE PESSIMISTIC THAN THE MODELS WITH CLOUD COVER THROUGH 
TUESDAY. MODELS AGREE THAT A STRONG WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN WILL 
CONTINUE OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH TUESDAY...BEFORE A COLD 
FRONT MOVES INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY. GFS MODEL IS FASTER THAN THE 
NAM MODEL WITH THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF THIS COLD FRONT...AND HAS 
IT ENTERING THE FORECAST AREA BY LATE TUESDAY MORNING. THIS GFS 
MODEL SOLUTION APPEARS TO HAVE MORE SUPPORT FROM THE CANADIAN AND 
ECMWF MODELS...SO WILL FOLLOW ITS FASTER PROGRESSION. IF THE SLOWER 
NAM MODEL SOLUTION VERIFIES...IT APPEARS THAT TSTORMS WILL BE 
POSSIBLE LATER IN THE AFTERNOON DUE TO MORE LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE BEING 
ABLE TO MOVE NORTHWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONT SHOULD 
BECOME STALLED-OUT AROUND THE MOUNTAINS BY TUESDAY NIGHT...AS THE 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM MOS 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT... 
AND WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER NAM NUMBERS DUE TO THE 
HIGH DEWPOINTS ALREADY IN PLACE AND THE EXPECTED CONTINUATION OF THE 
WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN THROUGH TUESDAY. ON TUESDAY NIGHT...WILL 
PLAN TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY WITH THE 
FRONTAL LOCATION BY THEN.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAIN WEATHER MAKER OF THE 
EXTENDED CONTINUES TO BE A FRONT THAT WILL MOVE THROUGH AND CONTROL 
AREA WEATHER WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. CONTINUE TO SEE DIFFERENCES IN 
MODEL DETAIL...AND HAVE KEPT 20 TO 40 POPS THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. 
MUCH COOLER AIR MOVES IN BEHIND THE FRONT AND ANY SHOWERS THAT 
LINGER INTO THURSDAY NIGHT COULD SWITCH TO SNOW OVER HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. FOR FRIDAY AND THE WEEKEND...HIGH PRESSURE RULES FOR DRY

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH A WEAK QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
OVER THE MID WEST. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A BROKEN LAYER OF 
CLOUDS OVER MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA...RESULTING FROM MOISTURE 
TRAPPED BENEATH A MID LEVEL INVERSION (SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY). MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT THIS MID LEVEL INVERSION WILL LINGER INTO 
THE AFTERNOON HOURS...SO THINK THAT VERTICAL MIXING WILL BE LIMITED 
RESULTING IN A SLOW DISSIPATION OF THESE CLOUDS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
AN INVERSION IN THE 850-800 MB LAYER IS TRAPPING MOISTURE AND 
PRODUCING BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUD COVER ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA 
THIS MORNING. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT THE INVERSION WILL REMAIN 
IN PLACE THROUGH THE DAY...SO EXPECT THAT THERE WILL NOT BE QUITE AS 
MUCH CLEARING AS MOS GUIDANCE SUGGESTS. STILL...WE WILL BE IN A WARM 
ADVECTION PATTERN WITH HIGH PRESSURE TO OUR EAST PRODUCING A SW FLOW 
IN THE LOW LEVELS. LEANED TOWARD THE COOLER GFS MOS GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES...THOUGH HIGHS WILL BE A BIT HIGHER THAN YESTERDAY 
EVERYWHERE...LOWER 60S NORTH TO UPPER 60S SOUTH. PATTERN WILL NOT 
CHANGE MUCH TONIGHT...SO THE TREND OF WARMER NIGHTTIME TEMPS WILL 
CONTINUE AS WELL...LOWS MAINLY IN THE 40S ARE EXPECTED TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE 
REGION PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR MONDAY. A FRONT ENTERS THE AREA ON 
TUESDAY AND LINGERS INTO THURSDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE CHANCES 
POPS GOING FOR TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES ON 
WEDNESDAY AND WEDNESDAY NIGHT WHEN THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT 
ARRIVES. THE LATEST MODELS SLOW THE EXIT TIME OF THE FRONT INTO 
THURSDAY NIGHT...SO WILL ADD LOW POPS INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. WITH THE 
COLDER AIRMASS EXPECTED WITH THE FRONT...MAY SEE SNOW ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED FOR THE 
FIRST PART OF THE PERIOD WITH A COOL DOWN BY THE END OF THE 
WEEK...STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AREA OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION 
ASSOCIATED WITH WEAK SHORT WAVE TROUGH CURRENTLY MOVING INTO WEST 
TENNESSEE PER RADAR MOSAIC. MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT THIS 
FEATURE WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN AS IT MOVES EASTWARD. THUS NOT 
EXPECTING ANY SIGNIFICANT PRECIP AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER...DID 
CONTINUE TO CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS OVER MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA IN THE FIRST PERIOD. TROUGH EXITS BY LATE IN THE FIRST 
PERIOD WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING BACK INTO THE AREA DURING 
THE SECOND PERIOD. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE 
SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE STILL LOOKS
TO BUILD FROM FRIDAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WHILE SURFACE RIDGE
MOVES ACROSS THE REGION THEN SLIPS JUST TO OUR SE. THUS...TIME
HEIGHTS SHOW A DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE WITH SEASONAL LOW TEMPS AND MAX
TEMPS SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED GOOD FOR
THESE PERIODS WITH VERY MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.

MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE SOME BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...WITH ECMWF
GENERALLY MORE AMPLIFIED ALOFT...AND GFS A BIT WEAKER AND MORE
PROGRESSIVE. DESPITE THESE DIFFERENCES...TREND IS STILL FOR BETTER
CHANCE OF SHOWERS ON WEDNESDAY...AND SAFE TO KEEP MONDAY INTO
TUESDAY DRY FOR NOW. ECWMF IS SUGGESTING DIMINISHING RAIN CHANCES
FOR THANKSGIVING DAY...WHILE GFS ADVERTISES LINGERING LIGHTER
SHOWERS FOR THE HOLIDAY. GIVEN THE UNCERTAINTY WITH THE OVERALL
PATTERN...I ONLY NUDGED RAIN CHANCES UP BY ABOUT 10 PERCENT ON
WEDNESDAY. WILL LET DAYSHIFT PONDER THIS AS THEY ADD GRIDS OUT TO

WEAK LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE EAST TONIGHT AND FURTHER WEAKEN AS IT 
MOVES ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. GFS AND NAM MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT ONLY VERY LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL BE GENERATED OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA AS THE UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS WEAKEN. MODELS ALSO 
INDICATE THAT TEMPS WILL BE WARM ENOUGH FOR MOSTLY RAIN WITH THIS 
SYSTEM. THIS SYSTEM QUICKLY EXITS THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY

AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH MAXES...BUT REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH

BEEN THE VERIFYING TREND LATELY.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...NOT A GREAT DEAL OF 
DIFFERENCE IN MODEL SOLUTIONS DURING THE EXTENDED EXCEPT POSSIBLY 
FOR DAY SEVEN WHERE THE ECMWF IS A LITTLE QUICKER BRINGING A COLD 
FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA. MOST OF THE FORECAST SHOULD BE RATHER 
NICE WITH AN UPPER TROF OVER THE WEST AND RIDGING ONLY GRADUALLY 
GIVING WAY TO THE APPROACHING TROF BY TUESDAY/WEDNESDAY. THE MEAN 
FLOW WILL BE SOUTHWESTERLY ALLOWING FOR MODERATING TEMPERATURES THAT 
WILL BE SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL ESPECIALLY LATER IN THE PERIOD 
AS THE LOW LEVEL FLOW BECOMES SOUTHERLY. SUNSHINE SHOULD BE IN 
ABUNDANT SUPPLY THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH INCREASING MOISTURE DURING

THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. LATEST MODEL RUNS HAVE SLOWED DOWN 
PROGRESSION OF MINOR SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES LATE IN THE SHORT TERM. 
THIS COUPLED WITH DRY LAYERS PERSISTING IN THE LOWER LEVELS HAS 
PROMOTED REMOVAL OF POPS LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. FOR TEMPS... 
GUIDANCE VALUES ARE FAIRLY CLOSE AND APPEAR REASONABLE. GENERALLY 
DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM THOSE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...SRN STREAM SHORTWAVE
TROUGH IS ADVERTISED AS WEAKER AND SLIGHTLY SLOWER TO ARRIVE ON
THURSDAY MORNING...ESPECIALLY BY NAM AND GFS (ECMWF STILL FASTER
AND A BROADER AREA OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION). MODEL SOUNDINGS AND
PARTIAL THICKNESSES TOO WARM FOR ANY SNOW SHOWERS THURSDAY MORNING
ANYWAY. THUS...GIVEN THESE TRENDS...I OPTED TO REMOVE POPS FROM ALL
BUT EXTREME WRN MOST COUNTIES AT DAYBREAK THURSDAY. KEPT LOW POPS
FOR RAIN SHOWERS AS BEFORE FROM 15Z THURSDAY ON...WITH SRN VALLEY
INTO SW NC COUNTIES DRY. 

OTHERWISE...A DRY EXTENDED EXCEPT FOR TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY (NEW
DAY 7)...AND I SAW NO REASON TO TINKER WITH POPS FOR TUESDAY OR
TUESDAY NIGHT THIS FAR OUT. TIMING NOW WOULD FAVOR A GOOD CHANCE OF
RAIN LATE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. 

SLIGHT MAX/MIN TEMP ADJUSTMENTS IN LINE WITH LATEST NAM/GFS/GFSX
MOS GUIDANCE...AND TO MESH WITH NWS NEIGHBORS GRIDS. DEWPOINT TEMPS
AND WINDS FRESHENED WITH LATEST NAM12 AND MOS GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKING 
OUT OF THE REGION EARLY TONIGHT. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR 
THE EVENING HOURS. IT WILL BE BREEZY EARLY TONIGHT AS THE LOW EXITS 
THE AREA...BUT NOT STRONG ENOUGH FOR AN ADVISORY. HIGH PRESSURE 
RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY. LOWS TEMPERATURES FOR 
TONIGHT SHOULD BE NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS. IT SHOULD BE WARM ENOUGH 
FOR ALL LIQUID PRECIPITATION.  WITH A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY EXPECTED FOR 
WEDNESDAY GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOKED REASONABLE SO DIDN'T STRAY TOO 
FAR.  

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...A FAST MOVING SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
OHIO AND NORTHERN TENNESSEE VALLEYS. THE MAIN SYNOPTIC FORCING WILL 
BE MAINLY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT DUE TO PROXIMITY 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA WILL EXPERIENCE THE BEST CHANCE OF RAIN. LOW 
PRESSURE AND ASSOCIATED FRONT WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE AREA 
THURSDAY MORNING WITH WEAK NORTHWEST OROGRAPHIC LIFT FOR THURSDAY 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. CLOUDS WILL CLEAR THURSDAY NIGHT AND WITH 
SUNNY SKY FOR FRIDAY. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...MODELS IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
LOW AMPLITUDE UPPER RIDGING OVER THE REGION...AND HIGH PRESSURE AT THE 
SURFACE...SHOULD KEEP THINGS FAIRLY TRANQUIL THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  
ALTHOUGH SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES IN THE MODELS...LOOKS LIKE BY

OVER NRN 1/2 OF THE FORECAST AREA. SOME WRAP-AROUND LIGHT AMOUNTS
LATER TONIGHT AS UPPER LOW LIFTS NE OF THE REGION. GRIDS WERE

SOME CONCERN THAT WIND SPEEDS AND/OR GUSTS MAY REACH ADVISORY
CRITERIA AS THE GRADIENT TIGHTENS AND SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET
INCREASES THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...CLOUD COVER...PRECIPITATION AND
LACK OF INSTABILITY SHOULD KEEP WIND SPEEDS BELOW NAM12 VALUES.
WIND SPEEDS AND GUSTS WERE TRIMMED BACK SOME...MORE OF A BLEND

LOW-AMPLITUDE RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE REGION. THROUGH THAT APPROACHES 
LATE WEDNESDAY CONTINUES TO APPEARS RATHER INSIGNIFICANT AT THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LIGHT RAIN FINALLY STARTING TO 
REACH THE SURFACE OVER OR NEAR OUR PLATEAU COUNTIES THIS MORNING... 
AS COLD FRONT HAS MOVED EAST TO A NE AL TO ERN KY LINE. HOWEVER...
I THINK SHORT RANGE MODELS ARE CORRECT IN DEPICTING THESE SHOWERS 
REMAINING VERY LIGHT AND NO MORE THAN SCATTERED IN COVERAGE...
AS THERE IS NOT A CONNECTION TO ANY DEEP MOISTURE FROM THE GULF 
COAST REGION (UNTIL LATER IN THE EXTENDED PERIODS).  

THUS...KEPT POP GRIDS MUCH IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST ALTHO DID 
OPT FOR AREAL COVERAGE WORDING FOR TODAY. COOLER TODAY BY ABOUT 10 
DEGREES AND MOS MAXES WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE GONE BY 06Z MONDAY...ALTHO SOME DEGREE OF 
CLOUDINESS MAY LINGER...ESPECIALLY OVER SRN MOST AREAS CLOSER TO THE 
STALLING FRONTAL BOUNDARY. MOS MINS CLOSE AND LOOKED QUITE 
ACCEPTABLE.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
IN BEHIND COLD FRONT THAT WILL LIE JUST EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA
MONDAY MORNING. LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING ALONG THE FRONT OVER THE NW
GULF WILL BRING MOISTURE BACK INTO THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY MORNING
AND SPREAD NE INTO SW VA BY AFTERNOON. MORE SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL AS
THE LOW DEVELOPS ACROSS THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND MOVES NORTHEAST
INTO THE TN VALLEY TUESDAY AND THEN NE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND NE
INTO EASTERN CANADA BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. RAINFALL AMOUNTS OF ONE
TO TWO INCHES POSSIBLE BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. ANOTHER QUICK MOVING
SYSTEM WILL MOVE ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS THURSDAY BUT
PRECIPITATION AMOUNTS WILL BE LIGHT. RIDGING BUILDS IN FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY FOR DRYING CONDITIONS AND NEAR SEASONAL TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. LOOKING HARD FOR 
WEATHER STORY UNDER LAYER RIDGING. MORNING INVERSION AROUND 2500 
FEET RESULTED IN RELATIVELY WARM MIN TEMPS ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS
OF SW VA AND E TN. MOST MINS ABOVE THE THERMAL LAYER STAYED IN THE 
40S THIS MORNING. TEMPS HAVE JUMPED NEARLY 20 DEGREES IN TWO HOURS 
ACROSS SW NC IN DRY AIRMASS. WARM AFTERNOON ON TRACK. SON  

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RIDGING HOLDING FROM CENTRAL GULF 
COAST NORTH INTO TN VALLEY...THEN NE THRU THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS 
AND NE STATES. CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS HAVE ALLOWED TEMPS TO 
FALL BELOW MOS AND PREVIOUS GRIDS THIS MORNING...IN THIS DRY AIR MASS.
MY WARMER THAN MOS HIGHS DO STAY BELOW RECORD HIGHS FOR THIS DATE.

SEE NO REASON WHY MAX TEMPS WON'T TOP OUT AROUND THURSDAY'S HIGHS
GIVEN THE PLENTIFUL SUNSHINE AND DRY AIR. THUS...WENT ABOUT 1 TO 2 
DEGREES ABOVE THE WARMER MOS FOR HIGHS TODAY. SURFACE WINDS STAY 
LIGHT AND VARIABLE TONIGHT WITH NO CLOUDS AT ANY LEVEL...SO FAVORED 
LOWER MINS WITH ABOUT A 35 DEGREE OR SO DIURNAL RANGE FROM MAX TO 
MIN TEMPS AGAIN.

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE STILL IN 
CONTROL SATURDAY AS WEAKENING FRONTAL SYSTEM MOVES INTO MS VALLEY. 
AS MAIN LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES INTO THE GREAT LAKES TRAILING FRONT 
WILL APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE 
SLOWLY ACROSS THE AREA SUNDAY WITH LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPING NEAR NEW 
ORLEANS AND MOVE UP ALONG THE FRONT MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. BEST RAIN 
CHANCES WILL BE MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE 
TN VALLEY WEDNESDAY AS BROAD UPPER TROUGH MOVES INTO THE NORTH 
CENTRAL STATES. A SECONDARY FRONT MAY PASS THROUGH THURSDAY BUT FOR 
NOW WILL KEEP THURSDAY DRY. WARM TEMPERATURES CONTINUE SATURDAY AND 
DRY AIR WILL ALLOW STRONG COOLING SATURDAY NIGHT CLOUDS WILL MOVE IN 
LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AND KEEP TEMPERATURES DOWN SUNDAY. COOLER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL RIDGE REMAINS 
STRONG TODAY AND WILL CONTINUE THROUGH WEDNESDAY. CURRENT 
TEMPERATURES ARE IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S WITH LIGHT WINDS AND 
LOW RELATIVE HUMIDITIES. DRY AIRMASS WILL KEEP MOST AREAS CLEAR WITH 
PATCHY FOG NEAR RIVERS AND LAKES ALTHOUGH NOT SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH TO 
PUT INTO FORECAST. LOWS TONIGHT SHOULD BE A FEW DEGREES WARMER. 
PREFER COOLER MAV GUIDANCE WITH LOWS ONLY NEAR TO SLIGHTLY BELOW 
FREEZING IN COLDER VALLEYS OF SW NC AND NE TN. ELSEWHERE LOWS MID 
30S TO MID 40S. ONLY PATCHY FROST AS WELL SIMILAR TO THIS MORNING. 
HIGHS WEDNESDAY WITH FULL SUNSHINE SIMILAR TO TODAY IN THE UPPER 60S 
TO MID 70S WHICH COINCIDES WITH A MAV/MET BLEND.   

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH MAINTAINING AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...RESULTING IN TRANQUIL AND UNSEASONABLY 
WARM CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED 
TO SLOWLY MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT...AND THEN 
BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY AROUND THE MOUNTAINS ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS 
THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES PARALLEL TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. IT 
APPEARS THAT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED AND UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS WILL 
BE WEAK WITH THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY UNTIL MONDAY...SO WILL MENTION 
ONLY LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH 
SUNDAY NIGHT. ON MONDAY...BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS REVEAL A 
STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFYING OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS... 
RESULTING IN STRONG CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY ON 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. THIS PATTERN SHOULD RESULT IN A GOOD 
COVERAGE OF RAIN FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...SO WILL RAISE POPS SOME FOR 
THE MONDAY AND TUESDAY TIME FRAME. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE 
TO THE GFS MOS NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

WEAK FRONT SLIDES THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY.  WITH 
LITTLE MOISTURE OR ENERGY ACCOMPANYING THE FRONT...HAVE KEPT POPS 
LOW...GENERALLY IN THE 20S TO NEAR 30. CONFIDENCE DIMINISHES BY HE

PROVIDING A CLEAR SKY AND DRY WEATHER TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES AND THE  
REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. NO CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE AT THE SURFACE AND 
ALOFT HAS TAKEN CONTROL OF PATTERN OVER THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. WARMING ALOFT HAS BROUGHT TEMPERATURES UP TO THE UPPER 
50S AND 60S. DRY AIR MASS HAS DROPPED RH VALUES TO THE TEENS AND 20S 
AT MOST LOCATIONS. WINDS HAVE BEEN GENERALLY LIGHT BUT 10 TO 15 MPH 
IN THE NE AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS. ANOTHER COLD NIGHT TONIGHT IN 
PROTECTED VALLEYS NE SECTIONS AND SW NC WITH LOWS IN THE MID AND 
UPPER 20S BUT 10 TO 15 DEGREES WARMER HIGHER ELEVATION RIDGE TOPS 
WITH SW FLOW ALOFT. TUESDAY ANOTHER WARM DAY WITH TEMPERATURES MID 
60S TO MID 70S WELL BELOW RECORDS BUT 5 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. 
WITH DRY AIR IN PLACE AFTERNOON RELATIVE HUMIDITIES WILL AGAIN BE 
MOSTLY FROM ABOUT 15 TO 25 PERCENT. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY THROUGHOUT THE WEEK...RESULTING IN TRANQUIL AND 
UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH 
SATURDAY. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY NIGHT...AND THEN BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY 
ALONG THE MOUNTAINS ON SUNDAY AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES 
PARALLEL TO THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED WITH THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
ALONG WITH WEAK UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS UNTIL MONDAY...SO WILL MENTION 
LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS FROM SATURDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH SUNDAY 
NIGHT. BY MONDAY...A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO AMPLIFY 
OVER THE PLAINS...RESULTING IN STRONG CYCLOGENESIS OVER THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH 
THE EXACT TRACK OF THIS SURFACE LOW ON MONDAY (AND THE RESULTING 
AMOUNT OF PRECIP OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY). FOR NOW...WILL MENTION 
CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT...WHICH IS A SIMILAR IDEA TO 
THE MORE NORTHERLY TRACK OF THE LATEST ECMWF MODEL RUN. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE GFS MOS NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED 
PERIOD...WHICH ARE CLOSE TO THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD FRONT TRACKING THROUGH THE 
AREA BRINGING RAIN TO THE AREA EARLY TODAY. THE FRONT IS EXPECTED TO 
EXIT THE CWA BY THIS AFTERNOON. SO WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR 
PRECIPITATION FOR THE MORNING HOURS IN THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE 
CWA. MOST OF THE RAIN SHOULD OUT OF THE AREA BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. 
BUT UPPER TROUGH IS EXPECTED MOVE INTO THE AREA TONIGHT WITH COLD 
AIR FILTERING IN BEHIND THE FRONT. WITH MOISTURE STILL LINGERING... 
COULD SEE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS MAINLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS 
WHERE THE BEST UPSLOPE IS EXPECTED. WILL CONTINUE THE SPS FOR SNOW 
GOING FOR NOW. BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED BOTH DAYS... 
STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN ON 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...WHICH WILL BRING AN UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR MASS 
ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. WHILE THE MODELS REVEAL STEEP 
LAPSE RATES AND A DECENT NORTHWESTERLY UPSLOPE WIND FLOW RESULTING 
IN SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF THE APPALACHIANS... 
THEY STILL REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE AMOUNT OF MOISTURE 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA WITH THIS UPPER TROUGH. YESTERDAY'S RUN OF 
THE NAM MODEL WAS WETTER THAN THE GFS MODEL...BUT TODAY'S MODEL RUNS 
REVEAL THE LATEST NAM LOOKING LIKE YESTERDAY'S GFS WHILE THE LATEST 
GFS LOOKS LIKE YESTERDAY'S NAM. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL CONTINUE TO 
COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO MODELS WITH POPS AND PRECIP AMOUNTS...BUT 
IT STILL APPEARS THAT SEVERAL INCHES OF SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS (GENERALLY ABOVE 2500 FEET) BY FRIDAY NIGHT. 
THIS DEEP UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY EXIT THE REGION 
ON SATURDAY...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE QUICKLY BUILDING ACROSS THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BY EARLY NEXT WEEK RESULTING IN A WARMING 
TREND FOR NEXT WEEK. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE THAT 
ANOTHER LESS-AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL AFFECT THE FORECAST 
AREA AROUND WEDNESDAY NIGHT OR THURSDAY...BUT FOR NOW...WILL KEEP 
THE EXTENDED FORECAST DRY FOR THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGH THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE 
MEANS.

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. DECENT LIFT
WILL ACCOMPANY COLD FRONT AS IT SLIDES INTO THE AREA OVERNIGHT. 
AVAILABLE MOISTURE IN PLACE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT IS PRODUCING LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
EASTERN HALF OF TN AND NORTHERN AL/GA. MOISTURE DEPTH AND LIFT WILL 
INCREASE THIS EVENING AS THE UPPER TROUGH TO OUR WEST APPROACHES AND 
THE 300 MB JET OVER WV STRENGTHENS. CONVERGENCE WITH THE 850 MB 
TROUGH AND DIVERGENCE IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER JET MOVES 
OVER EAST TN AROUND MIDNIGHT. AVERAGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS AROUND A HALF 
INCH CAN BE EXPECTED. DRIER AIR MOVES IN QUICKLY BEHIND THE SURFACE 
COLD FRONT AND MIDLEVEL TROUGH...BRINGING A QUICK END TO MOST OF THE 
PRECIP THURSDAY MORNING. SW VA AND NE TN MOUNTAINS MAY HANG ONTO 
SOME SHOWERS AS THE FLOW ALOFT TURNS TO A MORE FAVORABLE UPSLOPE 
DIRECTION. THE 500 MB THERMAL TROUGH MOVES INTO THE AREA IN THE 
AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD KEEP PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES IN PLACE 
WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTHEAST. COLD ADVECTION THROUGH THE DAY 
WILL KEEP TEMPS ONLY IN THE 50S TOMORROW WITH 40S IN THE MOUNTAINS. 

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
ALL OF THE ACTION FOR THE EXTENDED WILL OCCUR EARLY WITH A DEEP
UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPING ACROSS THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION. FOR
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...NORTHWEST OROGRAPHIC FLOW
WILL DEVELOP WITH 850MB WINDS AROUND 25KTS PRODUCING MODERATE OMEGA
OVER THE NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES. MOISTURE IS FAVORABLE AND DEEP
ENOUGH (UP TO 700MB) TO PRODUCE OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION.
ALSO...NOTICE A TONGUE OF MOISTURE EXTENDING FROM THE GREAT LAKES.

COLD AIR ALOFT FROM DEEP UPPER TROUGH AND RELATIVELY WARM GROUND 
WILL PRODUCE FAIRLY STEEP LAPSE RATES AND CAPES OF 100-150 
J/KG...ESPECIALLY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE INSTABILITY WILL 
PRODUCE FAIRLY VIGOROUS SHOWERS FOR LATE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
FRIDAY EVENING.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT IS PRODUCING LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
EASTERN HALF OF TN AND NORTHERN AL/GA. MOISTURE DEPTH AND LIFT WILL 
INCREASE THIS EVENING AS THE UPPER TROUGH TO OUR WEST APPROACHES AND 
THE 300 MB JET OVER WV STRENGTHENS. CONVERGENCE WITH THE 850 MB 
TROUGH AND DIVERGENCE IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER JET MOVES 
OVER EAST TN AROUND MIDNIGHT. AVERAGE RAINFALL AMOUNTS AROUND A HALF 
INCH CAN BE EXPECTED. DRIER AIR MOVES IN QUICKLY BEHIND THE SURFACE 
COLD FRONT AND MIDLEVEL TROUGH...BRINGING A QUICK END TO MOST OF THE 
PRECIP THURSDAY MORNING. SW VA AND NE TN MOUNTAINS MAY HANG ONTO 
SOME SHOWERS AS THE FLOW ALOFT TURNS TO A MORE FAVORABLE UPSLOPE 
DIRECTION. THE 500 MB THERMAL TROUGH MOVES INTO THE AREA IN THE 
AFTERNOON...WHICH SHOULD KEEP PARTLY TO MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES IN PLACE 
WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS NORTHEAST. COLD ADVECTION THROUGH THE DAY 
WILL KEEP TEMPS ONLY IN THE 50S TOMORROW WITH 40S IN THE MOUNTAINS. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
ALL OF THE ACTION FOR THE EXTENDED WILL OCCUR EARLY WITH A DEEP
UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPING ACROSS THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION. FOR
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT...NORTHWEST OROGRAPHIC FLOW
WILL DEVELOP WITH 850MB WINDS AROUND 25KTS PRODUCING MODERATE OMEGA
OVER THE NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES. MOISTURE IS FAVORABLE AND DEEP
ENOUGH (UP TO 700MB) TO PRODUCE OROGRAPHIC PRECIPITATION.
ALSO...NOTICE A TONGUE OF MOISTURE EXTENDING FROM THE GREAT LAKES.

COLD AIR ALOFT FROM DEEP UPPER TROUGH AND RELATIVELY WARM GROUND 
WILL PRODUCE FAIRLY STEEP LAPSE RATES AND CAPES OF 100-150 
J/KG...ESPECIALLY OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE INSTABILITY WILL 
PRODUCE FAIRLY VIGOUROUS SHOWERS FOR LATE THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH

HIGH PRESSURE OFF THE NEW ENGLAND COAST EXTENDS SOUTHWEST ACROSS
THE CAROLINAS AND INTO THE DEEP SOUTH...TO A WARM FRONT LOCATED
NEAR THE GULF COAST. NORTH OF THE WARM FRONT...WEAK ISENTROPIC
LIFT IN THE 295-305 K LAYER WILL PRODUCE LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS ACROSS
EAST TN THROUGH THE DAY. SINCE LIFT IS WEAK...PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL
BE LIGHT...AROUND A TENTH OF AN INCH OR LESS IN MOST SPOTS THROUGH

WHERE THE DEEPER MOISTURE IS EXPECTED. HIGHEST CHANCES FOR RAIN

TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN 
THROUGH SATURDAY...WHICH WILL BRING UNSEASONABLY COLD AIR ACROSS THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. THE MAIN DISCREPANCY INVOLVES THE AMOUNT 
OF MOISTURE AVAILABLE ON FRIDAY WITH THE STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
THAT SWINGS ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS AND PRODUCES NORTHWESTERLY 
UPSLOPE FLOW. VERTICAL THERMAL PROFILES INDICATE THAT IT WILL BE 
COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS BY THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...WITH SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE 
(DEPENDING ON THE AMOUNT OF AVAILABLE MOISTURE). FOR NOW...WILL KEEP 
POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORIES WITH THE HIGHEST POPS IN THE

SATURDAY...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE QUICKLY BUILDING ACROSS THE 
EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BY EARLY NEXT WEEK. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS 
AGREE THAT A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL THEN DEVELOP BY THE 
MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK OVER THE WESTERN HALF OF THE NATION...WITH 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW BRINGING A WARMING TREND ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS GUIDANCE

THIS AFTERNOON. THROUGH MODEL DEPICTION...THIS FEATURE APPEARS TO 
HAVE ONLY LIMITED IMPACT ON THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY 
MORNING WITH A SMALL CHANCE OF A SHOWER ACROSS EXTREME SOUTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. HOWEVER...STRONG UPPER LEVEL 
TROF DIVING SOUTHEAST OUT OF CANADA WILL HELP TO DRAW MOISTURE FROM 
THE GULF BACK ACROSS THE PARCHED SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL GENERATE SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS MUCH OF 
THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY WITH AN INCREASING CHANCE

APPALACHIANS. SYSTEM COLD FRONT DRIVES RAPIDLY EAST INTO THE 
CAROLINAS EARLY THURSDAY BRINGING AN END TO THE RAINFALL. WRAP 
AROUND MOISTURE AND TRAILING ENERGY BUILDING SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE

AVAILABLE MOISTURE DROPS OFF FRIDAY NIGHT. H85 WINDS NW~20 WITH 
TEMPS FALLING TO AROUND -7C. FREEZING TEMPS WILL COVER THE AREA BY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...PLAINS UPPER TROF SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY DEEPEN WHILE SHIFTING SLOWLY SOUTHEAST TOWARD 
THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY...EVENTUALLY STRENGTHENING SUFFICIENTLY 
FOR THE FORMATION OF A CLOSED CENTER OF LOW PRESSURE. IN 
RESPONSE...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WILL DEVELOP ACROSS THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WITH INVERTED CONFIGURATION NORTHEAST INTO THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY ON TUESDAY. SYNOPTIC SCALE LIFT IN THIS PATTERN 
WILL BE MAINLY LIMITED TO THE DEEP SOUTH WITH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
LACKING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL A MORE SOUTHERLY COMPONENT 
DEVELOPS ON WEDNESDAY. SO...KEPT SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY 
OF PRECIP ACROSS THE SOUTHERN THIRD OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY AND 
TUESDAY NIGHT. BY WEDNESDAY GREAT LAKES UPPER LEVEL TROF WILL 
DROPPING SOUTHEAST INTO THE OHIO VALLEY WITH SURFACE COLD FRONT 
BUILDING TOWARD THE MID SOUTH. UNCERTAINTY EXISTS IN TIMING OF THE 
TRAILING UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED FRONT AND JUST HOW MUCH MOISTURE 
WILL BE AVAILABLE FOR LIFTING ON WEDNESDAY. THEREFORE JUST STAYED 
THE COURSE WITH LOW THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AT THIS 
TIME. GENERALLY USED A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR TEMPERATURES IN THE SHORT 
TERM.   

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE TO 
CURRENT FORECAST. TRENDED COOLER FOR LATER PART OF FORECAST.

MAJORITY OF THE DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH SOUTHERN 
STREAM SYSTEM REMAINS SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND PREFER THE GFS 
MODEL SOLUTION AND POPS.

AS NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED 
STATES THROUGH FRIDAY...ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT/EARLY THURSDAY. SCATTERED SHOWERS WILL 
ACCOMPANY FRONT. 

AS UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD AIR ADVECTION DEEPENS...AIRMASS 
WILL DESTABILIZE AND COMBINE WITH UPSLOPE NORTHWEST FLOW TO PRODUCE 
LIGHT SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. VERTICAL PROFILE WILL 
BECOME COLD ENOUGH BY FRIDAY MORNING TO PRODUCE SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. LIGHT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS ARE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS...SUCH AS 
MOUNT LECONTE.

UPPER TROUGH LIFTS NORTHEAST INTO NEXT WEEK WITH SUNSHINE RETURNING.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
WEAK COLD FRONT GENERALLY ALONG THE SOUTHERN TN BORDER...WITH ONLY A 
FEW HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH IT. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
CONTINUE SLOWLY MOVING SOUTH TODAY...WITH HIGH CLOUDS INCREASING 
TODAY AND TONIGHT AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEEPENS OVER THE PLAINS. 
THIS UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL DEVELOP A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY BY TONIGHT...WITH AN INVERTED SURFACE 
TROUGH DEVELOPING NORTHEAST OF IT AND EXTENDING INTO THE FORECAST 
AREA. HOWEVER...MODELS AGREE THAT THE AIR MASS OVER THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY WILL BE TOO DRY TONIGHT FOR ANY PRECIP DEVELOPMENT. AS FOR 
TEMPS...MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...TWO MAIN SYSTEMS WILL EFFECT 
THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE EXTENDED. FIRST IS THE SOUTHERN STREAM 
UPPER TROUGH THAT CLOSES OFF ACROSS TEXAS THEN MOVES EAST ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN GULF BEFORE BECOMING PART OF THE MAIN NORTHERN STREAM UPPER 
TROUGH THAT DEVELOP OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION.

MAJORITY OF THE DYNAMICS AND MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH SOUTHERN 
STREAM SYSTEM REMAINS SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND PREFER THE GFS 
MODEL SOLUTION AND POPS.

AS NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH DEEPENS ACROSS THE EASTERN UNITED 
STATES LATE WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY...ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
MOVE ACROSS THE AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT. ENOUGH MOISTURE AND LIFT 
ASSOCIATED WITH SYSTEM TO PRODUCE LIGHT SHOWERS THROUGH THURSDAY 
MORNING.

AS UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD AIR ADVECTION DEEPENS...AIRMASS 
WILL DESTABILIZE AND COMBINE WITH UPSLOPE NORTHWEST FLOW TO PRODUCE 
SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS LATE THURSDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. VERTICAL PROFILE WILL BECOME 
COLD ENOUGH BY FRIDAY MORNING TO PRODUCE SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE WINDS SHIFTING TO
WESTERLY ACROSS NRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...AND THE WEAK COLD
FRONT WILL LIKELY DRIFT THROUGH EARLY TONIGHT. HOWEVER...LITTLE TO
NO CHANGE IN OUR WEATHER OVERNIGHT...AND I WENT FOR MINS CLOSE TO
PERSISTENCE. LIGHT NE WINDS BEHIND THE FRONT SHOULD KEEP ENOUGH
MIXING FOR NOT ENOUGH FROST TO MENTION...AND LITTLE IF ANY CROPS
REMAIN ACROSS THE REGION.

CLOUDS LOOK TO HOLD OFF UNTIL MONDAY NIGHT...ALTHO HIGH CLOUDS MAY
ARRIVE ON MONDAY AND TAKE A FEW DEGREES OFF MAX TEMPS FROM HIGHS
TODAY. LONGWAVE TROUGH OVER SRN PLAINS AND LOWER MS VALLEY REGION
WILL EVENTUALLY THICKEN CLOUDS ON TUESDAY...BUT MODELS CONTINUE TO
SHUNT SHOWERS TO OUR SW...SO I TRIMMED POPS BACK A BIT ON TUESDAY.

OTHERWISE...MOS POPS AND TEMPS WERE CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A SHORT WAVE TROF/CLOSED 
UPPER LOW WILL MOVE SOUTHEAST FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO 
THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
WHILE A MAJOR LEAGUE UPPER TROF AMPLIFIES SOUTH ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
U.S. THIS WILL LEAD TO THE CONTINUATION OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT. LOW LEVEL 
LIFT WILL BE PROVIDED INITIALLY BY AN INVERTED SURFACE TROF IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH THE LEADING WAVE. THE TRAILING UPPER TROF DEEPENS 
AS IT DIGS FARTHER SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WHILE 
DRAGGING A COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY MORNING. 
THE UPPER TROF WILL NOT BE GOING ANYWHERE FOR THE NEXT THREE DAYS 
WITH A NEVER ENDING SUPPLY OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING SOUTH AND 
EAST AROUND THE BASE OF THE TROF. A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF COLD AIR 
ADVECTION WILL ENSUE IN THIS TYPE OF PATTERN AND TEMPS WILL BE COLD 
ENOUGH FOR SNOW SHOWERS WITH CHARACTERISTIC UPSLOPE FLOW. INITIALLY 
IN THE HIGHEST TERRAIN WILL BE IN A POSITION THURSDAY NIGHT INTO 
FRIDAY MORNING TO SEE SOME SNOW SHOWERS. THEN THE COMBINATION OF 
MODESTLY DEEP MOISTURE AND SHORT WAVE/OROGRAPHIC LIFT ACROSS MUCH OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE MOUNTAINS 
BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA WILL ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF LIGHT 
RAIN SHOWERS POSSIBLY CHANGING TO LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES 
FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING BEFORE THE PRECIP FINALLY SHUTS 
OFF AS THE UPPER TROF EDGES ONLY SLOWLY EAST. THEREFORE...MUCH OF 
SATURDAY SHOULD BE DRY WITH SOME IMPROVEMENT IN SKY CONDITION WITH A 
SLIGHTLY BETTER SUNDAY RETURNING AS AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE APPROACHES 
THE EASTERN U.S.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
GENERALLY AGREE ON OVERALL PATTERN THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG

OF THE SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES BY MID WEEK IS ONE OF
THE MAIN SOURCES OF UNCERTAINTY. CONTINUED POPS PRETTY MUCH AS
DEPICTED IN PREVIOUS GRIDS/FORECAST...BUT ANY DEVIATION OF
PROJECTED TRACK/STRENGTH HAS THE POTENTIAL TO PROFOUNDLY AFFECT
POPS. MODELS ALSO AGREE THAT UPPER FLOW WILL RAPIDLY TRANSITION
FROM NEARLY ZONAL TO HIGHLY AMPLIFIED BY LATE WORK WEEK.
HOWEVER...BOTH THE ECMWF AND CANADIAN MODELS DEPICT A MUCH MORE
AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN CONUS THAN THE
GFS...AND ALSO KEEP THE TROUGH AXIS FARTHER WEST. TENDED TO FAVOR
LESS EXTREME GFS MODEL. EVEN THEN...SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER TEMPS IN

TOWARD DAYBREAK...WHICH WILL KEEP WINDS UP A BIT OVERNIGHT. THIS

SURFACE RIDGE TO OUR NORTH WILL BRING NE WINDS ON SUNDAY...BUT
PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AGAIN TO REACH VERY CLOSE TO HIGHS LIKE TODAY. 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS SLOWER TO DEVELOP TO OUR SOUTHWEST...SO I 
KEPT THE FORECAST DRY INTO MONDAY. ALSO...SLOWED DOWN THE INCREASE
OF CLOUDS A BIT ON MONDAY. 

OTHERWISE...A MOS BLEND LOOKED BETTER FOR MINS EACH NIGHT...BUT I
CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE SIMILAR MOS MAX TEMPS EACH DAY. 
 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...NEW MODEL RUNS INDICATE 
EARLY WORK WEEK SYSTEM WILL BE A LITTLE SLOWER TO TAKE SHAPE WITH 
SYNOPTIC LIFT DISPLACED FARTHER SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. 
KEPT POPS IN LOW CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE LATER MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY AS LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES 
SLOWLY SOUTHEAST INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. A STEADY SUPPLY OF SHORT 
WAVE ENERGY WILL HELP TO SIGNIFICANTLY DEEPEN A LONG WAVE TROF OVER 
THE EASTERN U.S. THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. RELATIVELY DEEP MOISTURE WILL 
ROTATE SOUTH AND EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS ALONG WITH THE 
SHORT WAVE LIFT. IN ADDITION TO THE LARGE SCALE LIFT...AN UPSLOPE 
COMPONENT WILL AID THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW SHOWERS DURING THIS 
PERIOD ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND MUCH OF 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA. KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE

240 AM EDT SAT OCT 30 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION...WITH A 
COOL AND DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE SLIDING TO THE EAST TODAY...WITH SOUTHERLY 
WINDS DEVELOPING BY THIS AFTERNOON...BRINGING WARMER AND MORE MOIST 
AIR. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE TN RIVER VALLEY 
LATE TONIGHT...BUT WITH A DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE...THIS FRONT SHOULD 
JUST BRING AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...LONG TERM FORECAST HAS TAKEN A 
TURN TOWARD LESS CERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM 
WHICH APPROACHES EARLY NEXT WORK WEEK AS MEDIUM RANGE MODELS ARE 
SUFFERING FROM POOR RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY AND GENERAL DISAGREEMENT. 
AFTER HAVING ADVERTISED THE SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM AFFECTING THE 
REGION BY LATE MONDAY...THE LATEST RUN OF THE GFS NOW DEPICTS THIS 
SYSTEM TO STAY GENERALLY SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH ONLY MINOR 
EFFECTS FROM THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF THIS SYSTEM EXPERIENCED IN OUR 
CWA. THE ECMWF STILL HAS THIS SYSTEM MUCH FARTHER NORTH...BRINGING 
LIGHT TO MODERATE PRECIP INTO THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY. MODELS ALSO HAVING TROUBLE WITH THE PLACEMENT OF HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH THAT DEVELOPS SOMEWHERE OVER THE NORTHEASTERN 
CONUS BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD. WITH LACK OF AGREEMENT AMONG 
THE MODELS...HAVE NOT MADE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PRECEDING 
GRIDS/FORECAST. WITH THIS UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPMENT AND STRONG 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT...APPEARS TEMPS WILL FALL TO BELOW CLIMO BY 
LATE IN THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...A CLEAR AND FROSTY NIGHT
AHEAD AS SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE SETTLES SE ACROSS THE SRN
APPALACHIANS OVERNIGHT. MOS MINS RANGING FROM MID 20S TO MID/UPR
30S LOOKED ON TRACK. NOTHING GROWING ACROSS OUR REGION ANY LONGER
SO OUR FROST/FREEZE PROGRAM IS NO LONGER IN EFFECT. HOWEVER...I DID
MENTION AREAS OF FROST IN THE GRIDS AND ZFPMRX.

ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND A QUICK SHIFT TO S-SW LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL
ALLOW FOR A GREAT WEEKEND. RESULTS WILL BE A GOOD WARM-UP TO
ABOVE SEASONAL NORMS ON HIGHS AND VERY CLOSE TO NORMAL ON MINS.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DID NOT MAKE MAJOR 
CHANGES TO THE FORECAST WHILE USING A BLEND OF THE ECMWF AND GFS. 
APPLIED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS LATER MONDAY AFTERNOON 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AS AN UPPER TROF DROPS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS EN ROUTE TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY BY TUESDAY. 
KEPT BEST CHANCE FOR SHOWERS ON TUESDAY/TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE TROF 
STRENGTHENS AS IT CONTINUES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE WESTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO. STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER ON WEDNESDAY AS 
SOUTHERN TROF/UPPER LOW DESCENDS FURTHER SOUTH INTO THE GULF WHILE 
SHORT WAVE ENERGY DRIVES SOUTHEAST OUT OF CANADA. AT LEAST A COUPLE 
OF WAVES WILL RIDE SOUTHEAST TOWARD THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS 
THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY HELPING TO AMPLIFY A DEEP TROF OVER THE 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. IN THIS PATTERN THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED CHANCE 
FOR A SHOWER ACROSS THE REGION ON THURSDAY...MAINLY AFFECTING HIGHER 
TERRAIN FEATURES ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF FORECAST AREA BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT. TEMPERATURES WILL START NEAR NORMAL BUT WILL END UP 
BELOW NORMAL IN THE LAST HALF OF THE PERIOD AS THE EASTERN STATES 
TROF STRENGTHENS. HAD TO ADJUST THE GUIDANCE NUMBERS DOWN A FEW 
DEGREES BASED ON THE UPCOMING COOL WEATHER PATTERN.

AND LOOK REASONABLE. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...DRY AND TRANQUIL WEATHER 
CONDITIONS IN THE OFFING THROUGH THE FIRST SEVERAL PERIODS OF THE 
LONG TERM PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS AS UPPER FLOW BECOMES 
NEARLY ZONAL. MODELS ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
CONDITIONS WILL START TO DETERIORATE BY LATE MONDAY AS AN UPPER 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. THUS 
HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE POPS INTO MID WEEK. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE 
CONSIDERABLY BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM HOWEVER WITH GFS PROJECTING 
RELATIVELY TRANQUIL CONDITIONS IN NORTHWEST FLOW WHILE THE ECMWF 
DEPICTS A SIGNIFICANT UPPER LOW TO DEVELOP IN THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
REGION BY THURSDAY...KEEPING CONDITIONS SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED THROUGH

INCLUDING SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY WILL REMAIN DRY AS THE 
ATMOSPHERE OFFERS A TREND TOWARD ZONAL FLOW COMPLETE WITH DRY

MONDAY AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY SPILLS SOUTHEAST INTO THE MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY WITH SURFACE WAVE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. CRANKED 
POPS UP FROM SLIGHT CHANCE MONDAY NIGHT TO MEDIUM AND HIGH CHANCE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...SCATTERED SHOWERS CONTINUE 
TO TRACK NE NEAR AND ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY...AFFECTING MAINLY 
OUR EASTERN MOST COUNTIES. THIS AREA SHOULD BE THE PRIMARY LOCATIONS 
FOR LINGERING SHOWERS EARLY TONIGHT...BUT I KEPT AT LEAST SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS FOR ALL BUT OUR EXTREME WRN COUNTIES. PARTIAL CLEARING 
HAS OCCURRED OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU...AND A SIMILAR DECREASING 
CLOUD TREND WAS KEPT IN FORECAST GRIDS. MOS MINS CLOSE EXCEPT FOR 
LNP AND RHP...AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED. MY POPS WERE CLOSE TO A BLEND 
OF MOS NUMBERS.

FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPS SE AWAY FROM OUR REGION THURSDAY...AND A 
SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE BUILD GRADUALLY EAST INTO FRIDAY. WESTERLY 
SURFACE WINDS THURSDAY MAY ALLOW SOME DOWNSLOPING INTO NRN AND 
CENTRALS VALLEY OF E TN...PROBABLY WHY MOS IS WARMER FOR HIGHS FOR 
TRI THAN CHA. ANYWAY...MOS GUIDANCE MAXES LOOKED GOOD. COOLER 30S 
FOR THE MOST PART THURSDAY NIGHT...BUT WINDS SHOULD STAY UP TO 
PREVENT ANY WIDESPREAD FROST (ALSO FROST/FREEZE PROGRAM WAS DROPPED 
AS OF MONDAY THE 25TH). DRY AIR AND RIDGING FOR FRIDAY...BUT A 
NORTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW AND 850 MB COLD AIR ADVECTION...SO 50S AND 
60S ON TAP FOR FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS 
THE AREA PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY.  A FRONT 
TRACKS IN THE REGION WITH SUFFICIENT MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH IT TO 
KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY.  A CUTOFF LOW DEVELOPS ALONG THE  
FRONT CONTINUING THE RAIN CHANCES INTO WEDNESDAY. ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED EARLY IN THE PERIOD THEN BECOME MORE 
SEASONAL AS THE INCREASED CLOUDS AND RAIN ENTERS THE AREA BY THE END 
OF THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...BRIEF LULL IN ACTIVITY 
ANTICIPATED THROUGH MOST OF THE SHORT TERM AS UPPER SHORT WAVE 
TROUGH DEPARTS AND WEAK UPPER RIDGING BUILDS IN. UPPER FLOW 
PROGRESSIVE ENOUGH FOR MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW TO CREATE POTENTIAL 
FOR A FEW SHOWERS OVERNIGHT. THUS HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AREA-WIDE 
OVERNIGHT. NEXT SYSTEM...POTENTIALLY EVEN MORE SIGNIFICANT THAN 
TODAY'S EVENT...APPROACHES BY LATE TOMORROW. MODELS IN REASONABLE 
AGREEMENT THAT LINE OF CONVECTION SHOULD BE ENTERING PLATEAU BY 00Z 
WED. HAVE CONTINUED LIKELY POPS FOR ROUGHLY THE WESTERN HALF OF THE 
CWA IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS SYSTEM. WINDS ALSO A POTENTIAL FACTOR BY 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON AS MODEL TIME HEIGHTS DEPICT 50+ KNOT LOW-LEVEL 
JET PRECEDING ADVANCING SYSTEM. FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT AND LOOKS REASONABLE. DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 
THOSE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY WILL BE MAINTAINED AFTER 00Z WEDNESDAY DUE TO 
VERY STRONG LOW LEVEL FRONTOGENESIS ENHANCED BY AGEOSTROPHIC 
CIRCULATIONS. THE BEST LIFT IN OUR AREA WILL BE BETWEEN 00Z AND 06Z. 
THE COMBINATION OF VERY HIGH HELICITY AND MLCAPE OF 500-1000 J/KG 
WILL PRODUCE A THREAT OF TORNADIC SUPERCELLS TUESDAY EVENING. EXPECT 
THAT DISCRETE CONVECTION IN THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHERN TN VALLEY WILL 
MERGE INTO A QLCS AS IT TRACKS EASTWARD TUESDAY EVENING...WITH THE 
THREAT TRANSITIONING TO PRIMARILY STRAIGHT-LINE WINDS. CONFIDENCE IS 
HIGH OF SEEING WIDESPREAD WIND DAMAGE TOMORROW...SO WILL MENTION 
DAMAGING WINDS IN THE ZONE FORECAST.

THE SURFACE COLD FRONT IS NEARLY PARALLEL TO THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL 
FLOW...SO EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE PRECIP WILL BE SLOW...AND 
TRAINING CELLS WILL BE POSSIBLE. QPF AMOUNTS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT COULD 
EXCEED 2 INCHES IN SOME LOCATIONS...CREATING A FLASH FLOOD THREAT AS 
WELL. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WILL BE MENTIONED. 

DUE TO THE SOUTHWEST FLOW ALOFT AND SLOW FRONTAL MOVEMENT...SHOWERS 
WILL LIKELY LINGER INTO WEDNESDAY. THE 850 MB FLOW TURNS TO A MORE 
WESTERLY DIRECTION WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...AND PRECIP SHOULD EXIT AT 
THAT TIME. HOWEVER THE 850 MB THERMAL BOUNDARY DOES NOT ARRIVE UNTIL 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...SO HIGHS IN THE MID TO UPPER 70S WEDNESDAY WILL 
DROP TO THE 60S FOR THURSDAY.

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE FROM THE 
SURFACE THROUGH THE UPPER LEVELS WILL BE TRACKING FROM THE PLAINS 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND...PROVIDING DRY WEATHER AND 
GRADUALLY WARMING TEMPERATURES. HIGHS TEMPS WILL GO FROM THE MID 50S 
TO MID 60S FRIDAY TO UPPER 60S TO MID 70S BY MONDAY. THE ECMWF SHOWS 
A DEEP CLOSED LOW TRACKING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY ON MONDAY...BUT 
THE GFS MAINTAINS A MORE ZONAL FLOW ACROSS THE REGION UNTIL TUESDAY. 
WILL INTRODUCE MONDAY DRY BUT WITH INCREASING CLOUDS.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...WITH A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE CURRENTLY OVER 
THE ARKLATEX REGION WAS GENERATING AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY AND WESTERN TN RIVER VALLEY. THE 
AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA IS CURRENTLY STABLE...BUT MODELS 
INDICATE THAT IT WILL BECOME MARGINALLY UNSTABLE TOWARD SUNRISE. IN 
ADDITION...A FAIRLY STRONG 850 MB JET (AROUND 40 TO 50 KT) IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT...SO IT APPEARS 
THAT A FEW ISOLATED STORMS MAY BECOME STRONG TO SEVERE OVERNIGHT 
WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR DAMAGING WINDS. WITH THIS IN MIND...HAVE 
ALREADY UPDATED THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK TO REFLECT THIS 
POTENTIAL. 

AREA RADARS INDICATE THAT PRECIP IS CURRENTLY MOVING INTO THE 
SOUTHWESTERN PORTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA...SO WILL PLAN TO UPDATE 
THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO FRESHEN THE PRECIP WORDING. 
OTHERWISE...THE REST OF THE FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK AND WILL 
NOT PLAN TO CHANGE THIS EVENING.

WILL INCREASE SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALONG WITH TRANSPORT OF

THEN AS GFS BRINGS FRONT THROUGH ON MONDAY WHILE EUROPEAN MODEL 
KEEPS FRONT NORTH AND WEST OF REGION. GEFS ENSEMBLES TEND TO SUPPORT 
GFS THUS CONTINUED LIKELY POPS FOR MONDAY...ALTHOUGH CONFIDENCE NOT 
HIGH WITH THIS EVENT. REMAINDER OF LONG TERM ALSO LOW CONFIDENCE AS 
MEDIUM-RANGE MODELS CONTINUE THEIR DISAGREEMENT. DID NOT MAKE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS GIVEN UNCERTAINTY. CONSENSUS 
OF MODELS/ENSEMBLES DEPICT HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER TROUGH WILL

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER LEVEL TROUGH STILL IN PLACE 
ACROSS THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE NATION AND THE PREVAILING 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL ALLOW A DRY COLD FRONT TO WORK ITS WAY INTO 
THE REGION DURING THE AFTERNOON. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE ABLE TO WARM 
INTO THE LOWER AND MIDDLE 70S ACROSS A GOOD PART OF THE FORECAST 
AREA PRIOR TO FRONT ARRIVAL. THERE COULD BE A FEW CUMULUS CLOUDS 
AROUND IN ASSOCIATION WITH THE FROPA. SHOULD BE A BIT OF A GRADIENT 
IN PRESSURE TODAY WITH RIDGING ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND 
LOWER PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR A 
HEALTHY BREEZE MAINLY AFFECTING SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AS WELL AS THE HIGHER TERRAIN. SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE 30S 
ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION. WITH THE FLOW DECOUPLING ESPECIALLY AT 
LOWER ELEVATION INCLUDED PATCHY FROST FORMATION AFTER MIDNIGHT.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A SURGE OF COLD AIR OVER THE 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA FRIDAY MORNING WILL GIVE WAY TO A 
BUILDING RIDGE BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. THUS TEMPS WILL BE TRENDING 
WARMER HEADING INTO THE WEEKEND. CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING ON SUNDAY 
AS A DEEP SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING 
UPPER TROUGH. 

MODELS HAVE CONVERGED ON A SOLUTION FOR THE GENERAL PATTERN FOR 
SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...SHOWING A SHORTWAVE TROUGH CROSSING THE 
AREA ON MONDAY. THE BEST LIFT AND UPPER JET POSITION IS CENTERED 
AROUND 12Z MONDAY...SO WILL RAISE POPS FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. STRONG 
UPPER DIVERGENCE...A NEGATIVE LIFTED INDEX...AND 30+ KT LLJ SHOWN BY 
THE GFS SUGGEST A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS ON MONDAY. GIVEN THE 
CONVERGING MODEL SOLUTIONS AND LESS SPREAD IN THE ENSEMBLES...WILL 
RAISE POPS TO LIKELY ON MONDAY WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDER MENTIONED. 

THE MAIN CLOSED UPPER LOW STAYS WELL TO OUR NORTHWEST FOR 
MONDAY...AND TRACKS ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES ON TUESDAY. THE GFS 
INDICATES THAT THE FLOW ALOFT BECOMES MORE WESTERLY...RESULTING IN A 
FRONT STALLING SOMEWHERE NEAR OUR AREA. THE ECMWF SHOWS A MORE 
AMPLIFIED PATTERN AND STRONGER ATLANTIC RIDGE. EITHER SCENARIO LOOKS 
LIKE TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOVE NORMAL...BUT CONFIDENCE OF PRECIP 
CHANCES IS LOW...SO WILL KEEP LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS GOING FOR 
TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN DURING 
THE PERIOD...ALONG WITH DRIER AIR. WILL SEE A MAINLY CLEAR SKY BOTH 
PERIODS. THERE MAY BE SOME PATCHY FROST TONIGHT IN THE NORMALLY 
COLDER VALLEY LOCATIONS...BUT DOES NOT LOOK SIGNIFICANT ENOUGH FOR A 
FROST ADVISORY SO WILL JUST INCLUDE IN DATABASE AND MENTION IN ZFP. 
WILL STAY CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS...WHICH LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE COMING 
INTO BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE DEVELOPMENT OF AN UNSETTLED PATTERN 
FOR NEXT WEEK...BUT STILL REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE EXACT 
DETAILS. SINCE THE ECMWF MODEL HAS BEEN MORE CONSISTENT (AND USUALLY 
VERIFIES BETTER) THAN THE GFS MODEL IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WILL 
TREND THE FORECAST TOWARDS THE ECMWF MODEL. ALSO...THE LATEST 12Z 
GFS MODEL RUN HAS TRENDED CLOSER TO THE ECMWF MODEL...SO FEEL BETTER 
ABOUT THE ECMWF SOLUTION. WITH THIS IN MIND...IT APPEARS THAT HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE THE REGION THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH A MAJOR 
SHIFT IN THE UPPER-LEVEL PATTERN TO A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW REGIME 
BEGINNING BY SUNDAY (LEADING TO A RAPID RISE IN TEMPS AND MOISTURE 
ACROSS THE REGION). MODELS AGREE THAT A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT 
WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON MONDAY...WITH SOME 
MARGINAL INSTABILITY COMBINING TO PRODUCE SOME SCATTERED CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT. SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT CONTINUES OVER THE EASTERN 
HALF OF THE NATION THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK...SO WILL 
CONTINUE WITH AT LEAST A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS THROUGH WEDNESDAY. A 
STRONGER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE 
PLAINS ON WEDNESDAY...WHICH WILL LIKELY BRING A SIGNIFICANT AND 
CONVECTIVELY-ACTIVE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE 
LATEST GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS WHICH ARE IN BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THE 
ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SHORT WAVE TROF WILL MAKE PROGRESS 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS BY LATE MORNING BRINGING 
AN END TO THE LIGHT SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. SHOULD SEE 
SUNSHINE THROUGH BREAKS IN THE MID DECK ESPECIALLY WESTERN SECTIONS 
THIS MORNING WITH A CLEARING TREND DEVELOPING ACROSS THE REMAINDER 
OF THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE AFTERNOON. CLEAR SKIES EXPECTED 
TONIGHT AS DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW FILLS IN BEHIND THE DEPARTED UPPER 
TROUGH. TRENDED MAX/MIN TEMPS TOWARD THE WARMER GUIDANCE NUMBERS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...A SURGE OF COLDER AIR WILL 
ARRIVE THURSDAY/THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE JET STREAM DIPS DOWN INTO THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIAN REGION. THIS SHOULD BRING SOME COOLER TEMPS TO 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...WITH SOME SPOTS POSSIBLY GETTING 
CLOSE TO FREEZING UNDER CLEAR SKIES. A BUILDING RIDGE WILL BRING 
WARMER TEMPERATURES FOR FRIDAY...WITH A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW 
DEVELOPING BEHIND THE RIDGE AXIS FOR SATURDAY WILL PROVIDE ABOVE 
NORMAL TEMPS AND INCREASING CLOUDS.

THE GFS HAS SHOWN POOR RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY BEYOND 96 HOURS...AND 
HAS SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES WITH THE ECMWF AND THE CANADIAN MODELS. 
THE ECMWF AND CANADIAN SHOW A SHORTWAVE TROUGH BRINGING A CHANCE OF 
RAIN SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY. THE GFS SHOWS A CLOSED SOUTHERN STREAM 
LOW TRACKING ACROSS TEXAS AND THE DEEP SOUTH...PRODUCING A LOT OF 
PRECIP FOR US ON TUESDAY. IT DOES APPEAR THAT WITH EITHER 
SCENARIO...WE WILL BE SOLIDLY IN THE WARM SECTOR FOR THE BEGINNING 
OF THE WEEK...WITH TEMPERATURES WELL ABOVE NORMAL. SINCE CONFIDENCE 
IS LOW...WILL NOT MAKE MUCH OF A CHANGE TO THE LAST THREE DAYS OF 
THE FORECAST...WILL JUST INCREASE TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION: 
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A COLD FRONT WILL PUSH THROUGH 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TONIGHT.  ASSOCIATED SHOWERS WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE FRONT AND BRING WIDESPREAD LIGHT SHOWERS TO THE AREA.  
RAINFALL AMOUNTS WILL AVERAGE BELOW A QUARTER OF AN INCH WITH 
RAINFALL EXITING THE AREA EARLY IN THE MORNING.   BEHIND THE 
FRONT...SKIES WILL CLEAR.  ABUNDANT SUNSHINE WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON 
WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO CLIMB INTO THE UPPER 60S AND 70S ACROSS 
MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS. 

LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...INITIALLY SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE AND NORTHWEST FLOW WILL RESULT IN CLEAR SKIES AND 
SEASONABLE TEMPS THROUGH THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. WILL NEED TO CONTINUE 
TO WATCH TEMPS ON THURSDAY NIGHT IN SHELTERED AREAS...BUT STILL 
BELIEVE THAT TEMPS SHOULD BOTTOM OUT IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S 
AT MOST LOCATIONS. 

UPPER RIDGING WILL SET UP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AND TENNESSEE
VALLEY BY SATURDAY IN ADVANCE OF THE NEXT UPPER TROUGH...PROGGED BY 
GFS/ECMWF TO BE ACROSS THE UPPER PLAINS BY 12Z SATURDAY. WITH WARM 
ADVECTION IN PLACE ACROSS THE AREA OVER THE WEEKEND...EXPECT A SLOW
INCREASE IN MID-HIGH LEVEL MOISTURE BY SUNDAY.

A SHORT WAVE AT 500 MILLIBARS WILL MOVE THROUGH WESTERN AND SOUTH
CENTRAL KENTUCKY ON SUNDAY...PLACING THE FORECAST AREA IN A GOOD
PVA AREA BY SUNDAY...ALTHOUGH MOISTURE WILL BE LACKING. WILL FOR
NOW JUST KEEP IN GOING SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AND WILL ALLOW FOR LATER
MODEL RUNS TO SEE IF WE HAVE CONSISTENCY BEFORE INCREASING PRECIP
CHANCES FOR THE AREA ON SUNDAY AND INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. 

A SECOND SHORT WAVE ALONG SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED BY
GFS/ECMWF TO PUSH EASTWARD ACROSS THE AREA ON MONDAY. GFS MODEL HAS
INCREASED POPS FOR FORECAST AREA INTO THE LIKELY CATEGORY...BUT
AGAIN WILL NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST ANOTHER MODEL RUN OR SO TO ACCOUNT
FOR CONSISTENCY BEFORE INCREASING POPS MUCH. WITH POTENTIAL FOR
MORE CLOUDS BY LATTER PART OF THE FORECAST PERIODS...WILL CONTINUE
WITH SLIGHTLY TRENDED TEMPS A LITTLE LOWER THAN GFS TEMPS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A FRONT THAT HAS BEEN STATIONARY OVER THE OHIO VALLEY WILL PUSH 
SOUTHWARD TODAY AS AN UPPER TROUGH PROGRESSES FROM THE FROM THE 
PLAINS TO THE APPALACHIANS. TODAY SHOULD BE DRY BUT WITH INCREASING 
HIGH AND MIDLEVEL CLOUDS. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW THE LOW LEVELS 
REMAINING QUITE DRY UNTIL AFTER 00Z. THE FRONT WILL MOVE INTO 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA AROUND 00Z. MOST OF THE PRECIP LOOKS 
TO BE LOCATED BEHIND THE FRONT...ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER DIVERGENCE IN 
THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET AND 500 MB PVA. THE BEST LIFT 
OCCURS IN A WINDOW BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z...AND WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS 
IN THIS TIME FRAME. PRECIP AMOUNTS SHOULD BE LIGHT WITH THE 
PROGRESSIVE UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE FRONT...LESS THAN A QUARTER 
INCH ON AVERAGE. DRY AIR SHOULD QUICKLY FOLLOW THE PASSAGE OF THE 
UPPER TROUGH AXIS WEDNESDAY MORNING...WITH CLEAR SKIES BY THE 
AFTERNOON. COLD ADVECTION SHOULD KEEP TEMPS IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 
70S IN MOST SPOTS WEDNESDAY.

A DRY NORTHWEST FLOW AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING EAST OVER THE MS 
VALLEY WILL PROVIDE CLEAR SKIES FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT. LOWS COULD APPROACH FREEZING BOTH NIGHTS IN SHELTERED 
VALLEYS...BUT MOST SPOTS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
NORTHEASTERN U.S. UPPER TROF LIFTS OUT ON FRIDAY ALLOWING FOR
RISING HEIGHTS AND TEMPERATURES AS THE MEAN FLOW STRENGTHENS OUT OF
THE SOUTHWEST. MOISTURE STARTS TO INCREASE IN THIS FLOW PATTERN BY
SUNDAY/MONDAY. AT LEAST A COUPLE SHORT WAVE FEATURES WILL RIDE
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS DURING THIS PERIOD
INCREASING THE CHANCE FOR SHOWERS. PLACED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP
SUNDAY NIGHT ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA INCREASING TO LOW CHANCE
PROBABILITY ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. TRENDED TEMP FORECAST
TOWARD BUT NOT QUITE AS WARM AS NEW MEX MOS THROUGH THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DOMINATE AREA WEATHER THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS IT SLOWLY SHIFTS 
AWAY FROM THE REGION.  HOWEVER...UPPER AND MID LEVEL CLOUDS WILL 
BEGIN TO INVADE AS THE NEXT WEATHER SYSTEM APPROACHES.  THE CLOUDS 
WILL INHIBIT TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY...THOUGH TUESDAY HIGHS WILL STILL 
BE ABOVE NORMAL...REACHING INTO THE 70S TO NEAR 80 ACROSS MOST 
VALLEY LOCATIONS.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...A SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE 
EAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TUESDAY 
NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY MORNING. NAM MODEL IS MORE AGRESSIVE WITH 
THE UPPER SUPPORT WITH A MUCH STRONGER AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL 
CIRCULATION DUE TO THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION. WILL TREND TOWARD THE 
WEAKER GFS SINCE THE THERE SINCE TO BE LESS INTERACTION FROM THE 
NORTHERN STREAM WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES. HOWEVER...WILL
CONTINUE WITH A HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS FOR SHOWERS.

SYSTEM MOVES EAST OF THE EARLY BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON WITH AN UPPER 
TROUGH BECOMING ESTABLISHED OVER THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES FOR THE 
LATER HALF OF THE WEEK. DRY NORTHWEST FLOW AND SURFACE RIDGING WILL 
PRODUCE MOSTLY SUNNY CONDITIONS WITH NEAR-SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES.

FOR THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...A SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER 
TROUGH MOVES INTO THE SOUTHWEST UNITED STATES WITH RIDGING SURFACE 
AND ALOFT OVER THE SOUTHEAST. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE (MAINLY MID AND 
HIGH LEVEL) FOR THIS WEEKEND. A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY. WILL INCLUDE LOW 
CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY...BUT OVERALL UNSEASONABLY WARM CONDITIONS 
WILL BE THE RULE FOR THE END OF THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
ANOTHER DRY AND MILD DAY IS EXPECTED ACROSS THE AREA AS WEAK HIGH 
PRESSURE LINGERS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A FRONT WILL REMAIN 
STALLED TO OUR NORTH ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY...WHILE AN UPPER LEVEL 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL APPROACH FROM THE WEST. THIS TROUGH WILL BRING 
SCATTERED TO BROKEN CIRRUS TODAY...BUT SHOULD NOT BE SIGNIFICANT 
ENOUGH TO DETER A CONTINUED WARMING TREND. HIGHS WILL REACH THE

OTHER SPOTS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS. LOWS TONIGHT WILL BE IN THE 40S 
WITH MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES.

FRONT TRACKING THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS GOING FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES 
ON TUESDAY NIGHT WHEN THE BEST MOISTURE AND LIFT TRACKS THROUGH THE

NIGHT BRINGING THE RETURN OF DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. MODELS INDICATING A FRONT ENTER THE AREA 
FOR THE WEEKEND. WITH CONSIDERABLE DIFFERENCE BETWEEN THE GFS AND

ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A 
VERY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS 
PROGGED TO BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA 
ON MONDAY...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES ZONAL. THIS COLD FRONT 
SHOULD THEN SLOWLY DRIFT INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY NIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY...AS THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BEGINS TO AMPLIFY SOME. MODELS ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT SOME ISOLATED SHOWERS WILL BE POSSIBLE OVER 
THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON...WITH 
SCATTERED SHOWERS DEVELOPING AREAWIDE ON TUESDAY NIGHT AS AN UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. NAM MODEL REVEALS 
MORE MOISTURE THAN THE GFS MODEL FOR TUESDAY NIGHT...AND FOR NOW 
WILL COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MAXES THROUGH THE FORECAST 
PERIOD...BUT REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS. WILL PLAN TO TREND 
TOWARDS A COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...ISOLATED SHOWERS SHOULD 
CONTINUE INTO WEDNESDAY AS A WEAK COLD FRONT BEGINS TO PULL AWAY 
FORM THE REGION. A SURFACE HIGH FILLS IN BEHIND THE FRONT AND WILL 
DOMINATE AREA WEATHER THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. THIS WILL RETURN US 
TO A DRY AND QUIET WEATHER PATTERN. MODEL CONSISTENCY QUITE POOR BY

240 PM EDT SAT OCT 16 2010

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER VALLEY 
AND MID WEST. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE INTO THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY...AND BECOME QUASI- 
STATIONARY OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND SOUTHEAST KY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. 
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOISTURE WILL BE VERY LIMITED 
ALONG THIS FRONT...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST THROUGH 
MONDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS REVEAL 
SOME LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH MINS...AND WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS 
THE COOLER GFS NUMBERS WHICH HAVE BEEN VERIFYING BETTER LATELY. WITH 
CURRENT DEWPOINTS IN THE 30S ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA...THINK 
THAT TEMPS FOR TONIGHT SHOULD FALL INTO THE 30S AREAWIDE AS THE HIGH 
PRESSURE AREA BECOMES CENTERED OVER THE FORECAST AREA. WITH MINS 
TONIGHT EXPECTED TO BE A COUPLE OF DEGREES COOLER THAN THIS 
MORNING...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE ANOTHER FROST ADVISORY FOR THE ENTIRE 
FORECAST AREA.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL SLIDE 
ACROSS THE REGION AROUND THE TUESDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. SOME 
DISCREPANCY IN TIMING REMAINS AS MODELS TRENDING A BIT FASTER. FOR 
NOW...HAVE ADDED LOW POPS IN OUR NORTHWEST LATE TUESDAY WITH HIGHEST 
POPS REMAINING IN PLACE FOR TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL CONTINUE TO LINGER 
SHOWERS INTO WEDNESDAY...THOUGH PRECIP MAY EXIT AT LEAST WESTERN 
LOCATIONS BY THIS TIME. SURFACE HIGH BUILDS IN BEHIND THE FRONT FOR 
A DRY AND QUIET WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE REST OF THE PERIOD. GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS STILL ON TRACK AND REMAINED CLOSE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE CENTERED OVER MIDDLE TN TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...WITH A DRY NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. THIS WILL RESULT IN CLEAR 
SKIES WITH LIGHT WINDS THROUGH THE PERIOD. MAIN FORECAST ISSUE WILL 
BE TEMPERATURES. LEANED A LITTLE TOWARD THE WARM SIDE OF MOS

NEEDED...AND ISOLATED SHELTERED VALLEYS COULD GET TO FREEZING. 
ALTHOUGH AFTERNOON MINIMUM RELATIVE HUMIDITIES SHOULD BE UNDER 30 
PERCENT...LIGHTER WINDS SHOULD REDUCE THE FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS FROM 
YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE 
REGION PROVIDING DRY WEATHERS INTO TUESDAY. MODELS FAIRLY SIMILAR ON 
TRACKING A WEAK FRONT THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY NIGHT AND

.AVIATION...
WINDS WILL BE THE MAIN AVIATION CONCERN TODAY AS LOW PRESSURE WILL
TRACK ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TO NORTH CAROLINA. A TIGHTENING
PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL PRODUCE SUSTAINED WINDS BETWEEN 12-18
KTS...AND BOUNDARY LAYER MIXING WILL GIVE WIND GUSTS OF 22-30 KTS.
THE STRONGER END OF THE SPEED RANGES WILL BE AT TRI...WITH THE
LOWER END AT CHA. A FRONTAL PASSAGE WILL SHIFT WINDS FROM SW TO
W-NW AROUND NOON. WINDS WILL DROP OFF QUICKLY WITH SUNET. ASIDE
FROM SOME MIDLEVEL CLOUD AT TRI THIS MORNING...SKIES WILL BE CLEAR.

335 AM EDT FRI OCT 15 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
THE ONGOING FROST ADVISORY WILL BE CONTINUED...THOUGH IT APPEARS 
THAT THE THREAT OF FROST WILL BE FAIRLY ISOLATED. THE COLDEST 
TEMPERATURES IN THE ADVISORY AREA ARE IN THE UPPER 30S...AND CURRENT 
DEWPOINTS SUGGEST THAT TEMPS WILL DROP NO LOWER THAN THE MID 30S. 
THE 8 AM END TIME FOR THE ADVISORY LOOKS GOOD AND WILL NOT BE 
CHANGED.

LOW PRESSURE OVER NORTHERN IN WILL DROP SOUTHEAST TO NC THROUGH THE 
DAY...WITH A TRAILING COLD FRONT PUSHING THROUGH THE AREA AROUND 
MIDDAY. SATELLITE TRENDS AND MODEL MOISTURE PROFILES SUGGEST SOME 
MIDLEVEL CLOUDS IN NORTHERN SECTIONS BEFORE FROPA...OTHERWISE SKIES 
WILL BE SUNNY. WINDS WILL BE GUSTY...AROUND 30 MPH...AND SHIFT FROM 
SW IN THE MORNING TO W-NW AFTER FROPA. RELATIVE HUMIDITY WILL BE IN 
THE 25-30 PERCENT RANGE...POTENTIALLY CREATING SOME FIRE CONCERNS. 
WILL COORDINATE WITH STATE FORESTRY OFFICIALS LATER THIS MORNING ON 
THE NEED FOR ANY FIRE DANGER STATEMENTS. 

TEMPS AND WINDS WILL DROP OFF QUICKLY AT SUNSET AS HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDS OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. TEMPS TONIGHT SHOULD DROP AT LEAST AS 
LOW IF NOT LOWER THAN THIS MORNING...SO A FROST ADVISORY WILL LIKELY 
BE NEEDED AGAIN...WITH POSSIBLY MORE COUNTIES INCLUDED. WILL DEFER 
TO THE DAY SHIFT TO ISSUE ANY ADVISORY FOR TONIGHT. CANNOT RULE OUT 
A FREEZE IN SOME AREAS TOO...BUT CONFIDENCE IS NOT HIGH ENOUGH YET 
TO ISSUE A FREEZE WATCH.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS 
THE REGION PROVIDING DRY WEATHERS INTO TUESDAY. MODELS FAIRLY 
SIMILAR ON TRACKING A WEAK FRONT THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND WEDNESDAY. MOISTURE IS LIMITED SO WILL KEEP ONLY 20 PERCENT 
CHANCE POPS GOING FOR NOW. FRONT IS EXPECTED TO EXIT THE REGION 
QUICKLY ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT BRINGING THE RETURN OF DRY WEATHER ON 
THURSDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. TEMPERATURES STILL ABOVE NORMAL 
FOR THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BE THE DOMINATE WEATHER MAKER FOR THE SHORT-TERM. ANOTHER WEAK 
SHORT-WAVE WILL ROTATE AROUND NORTHEAST UPPER TROUGH...BUT 
ASSOCIATED CLOUDS AND SHOWERS WILL BE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA.

MAIN CONCERN WILL BE AREAS AND PATCHY FROST OVERNIGHT. HAVE ISSUED A 
FROST ADVISORY FOR THE PLATEAU...SOUTHWEST VIRGINA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE...FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS...AND EXTREME SOUTHWEST 
NORTH CAROLINA.

CLEAR SKY AND LIGHT-CALM WINDS MAY PRODUCE AREAS OF FOG NEAR AREA 
LAKES AND STREAMS...SO HAVE INCLUDED PATCHY FOG IN THE FORECAST AS 
WELL FOR TONIGHT-EARLY FRIDAY.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER THE 
CENTRAL U.S. EARLY IN THE PERIOD WILL PUT THE MRX CWA IN DRY 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT.  THE RIDGE SLOWLY DAMPENS OVER THE REGION 
DURING THE WEEKEND WITH UPPER FLOW BECOMING ZONAL BY MONDAY.  THIS 
WILL BE A DRY AND QUIET WEATHER PATTERN FOR THE AREA.  A WEAK FRONT 
SLIDES INTO THE AREA LATE TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY.  MOISTURE AND LIFT 
MINIMAL...SO HAVE KEPT POPS LOW FOR FRONTAL PASSAGE.  DRIER AIR 
MOVES IN BEHIND THE FRONT FOR A RETURN TO DRY CONDITIONS FOR 
THURSDAY.  AS FOR TEMPERATURES...GUIDANCE NUMBERS LOOKS REASONABLE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD FRONT AND ACCOMPANYING PRECIP 
CURRENTLY SWINGING THROUGH THE EAST TENNESSEE REGION. MODELS 
GENERALLY AGREE THAT FRONT WILL PUSH RAPIDLY EASTWARD AND MAINLY OUT 
OF THE AREA BY DAYBREAK. HAVE RETAINED SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS 
FOR THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS THROUGH THE MORNING 
HOURS WITH ALL AREAS DRY BY AFTERNOON AS AXIS OF AMPLIFIED UPPER 
TROUGH SHIFTS EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW 
DOMINATES THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE SHORT TERM. FOR TEMPS... 
GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE FROM MAV GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...EXTENDED FORECAST GRIDS
WERE GENERALLY RIGHT ON TRACK WITH JUST A FEW TWEAKS TO FRIDAY AND
ALSO LATE TUESDAY. SHORTWAVE DROPPING ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN ON
FRIDAY...AND THE TIGHT SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT ON BACK SIDE OF
DEPARTING LOW PRESSURE...WILL CREATE BREEZY TO WINDY CONDITIONS
FRIDAY INTO EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT. SPEEDS MAY REACH WIND ADVISORY
CRITERIA FOR SW VA AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF NE TN...WHICH LATER
SHIFTS CAN ISSUE AS/IF NEEDED. I ALSO SUSPECT THAT THESE WINDS MAY
KEEP MIN TEMPS UP A BIT FOR FRIDAY NIGHT...SO I TRENDED TOWARD THE
MILDER NAM MOS MINS OVER THE COOLER GFS MINS.

OTHERWISE...UPPER RIDGE STILL ADVERTISED TO FLATTEN ON MONDAY WITH
AN EAST TO WEST SLOW MOVING WEAK COLD FRONT PROGGED TO SAG
SOUTHWARD ON TUESDAY. LATEST GFS AND ECMWF LET THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY
EASE INTO FORECAST AREA BY LATE TUESDAY...SO I ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS FOR ALL BUT FAR SOUTHERN COUNTIES ON TUESDAY NIGHT. TIMING OF
SUCH A WEAK FRONT IN THE NEAR ZONAL FLOW ALOFT DOES NOT JUSTIFY
INCREASING SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR WEDNESDAY AT THIS TIME.

MAX AND MIN TEMPS ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY IN LINE WITH THE LATEST MOS
GUIDANCE AND NEIGHBORS GRIDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
TONIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING. A SOUTHERN STREAM JET OVER THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY COMBINED WITH AND A NORTHERN STREAM JET ACROSS THE 
OHIO VALLEY WILL PRODUCE STRONG UPPER DIVERGENCE. THE BEST 
DIVERGENCE WILL BE OVER EAST KENTUCKY...WEST VIRGINIA...AND OHIO. 
ALSO...LARGE SCALE ASCENT ASSOCIATED WITH Q-VECTOR FORCING WILL MOVE 
ACROSS EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. 

ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL PULL ACROSS THE AREA AS WELL 
TONIGHT-EARLY THURSDAY. MAIN LIMITING FACTOR IS LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
DUE TO RIDING INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO. HOWEVER...ENOUGH 
MOISTURE-MARGINAL INSTABILITY TO PRODUCE WIDESPREAD SHOWERS AND 
SCATTERED-ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS AS FRONT AND UPPER DYNAMICS MOVES 
THROUGH THE AREA. BEST CHANCES WILL BE OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA DUE TO THE CLOSER PROXIMITY TO THE UPPER DYNAMICS.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THE FORECAST AREA ENJOYS 
THE PROTECTIVE INFLUENCE OF DRY ADVECTION AND RIDGING THROUGH A GOOD 
PORTION OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD. THE RIDGE BREAKS DOWN ON TUESDAY AS 
PRESSURES START TO FALL ACROSS SOUTHEASTERN CANADA. UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH AMPLIFIES ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. TOWARD MID WEEK AND 
INCREASING NORTHERLY FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THIS FEATURE WILL HELP 
TO DRIVE COOLER AIR INTO THE MID SOUTH. MOISTURE WILL POOL AHEAD OF 
THE FRONT AND LIFTING WILL ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWER 
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY. THEREFORE ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS LATE IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO THE NEW 
MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT.

.AVIATION...STILL A BIT OF AC AROUND THIS AFTERNOON BUT SHOULD BE
MOSTLY SCT RATHER THAN BKN AS WEAKENING UPPER LOW GRADUALLY LIFTS
OUT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. NEXT SYSTEM IS DROPPING
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE UPPER MIDWEST. RELATIVELY WEAK SYSTEM WITH
VERY LIMITED CONVERGENCE EXPECTED ALONG COLD FRONT. SURFACE COLD
FRONT AND 85H TROF MOVE ACROSS THE TAF SITES AROUND 07-12Z WITH
BETTER CHANCE OF SEEING AN MVFR VSBY REDUCTION IN -RA AT TRI AND
TYS. STAYED WITH VCSH AT CHA WHERE MOISTURE/LIFT COMBINATION 
RATHER ANEMIC. KEPT CEILING AT TRI IN MVFR CATEGORY BUT AN IFR
CEILING IS CERTAINLY POSSIBLE. THIS CAN BE BETTER EVALUATED IN
SUBSEQUENT FORECASTS. PRECIP WRAPS UP CLOSE TO 12Z BUT EXTENDED
VCSH AT TRI THROUGH 15Z DUE TO EASTERN LOCATION. HEALTHY PRESSURE
GRADIENT BEHIND FRONT LEADS TO BREEZY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WITH FAIRLY
QUICK IMPROVEMENT IN FLIGHT CONDITIONS BACK TO VFR ACROSS MOST OF
THE REGION BY MID MORNING.

.DISCUSSION...UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND
TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS MORNING. CONFLUENT FLOW INTO THE EAST COAST
WILL CONTINUE TO WEAKEN UPPER TROUGH. A NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO OHIO VALLEY OVERNIGHT AND THURSDAY
WHICH WILL PROVIDE THE EMPHASIS TO PULL A FRONT THROUGH THE AREA.

UNTIL THEN...ENOUGH INSTABILITY TO WARRANT LOW CHANCE TO CHANCE
POPS OVER THE AREA...HOWEVER...HAVE LOWERED POPS MOST LOCATIONS.
HAVE ALSO REDUCED THE CLOUD COVER SOME FOR TODAY. CURRENT
TEMPERATURE FORECAST LOOKS GOOD.

HAVE A GREAT DAY...

AWAY FROM THE REGION TODAY LEAVING RELATIVELY DEEP MOISTURE BUT ONLY 
WEAK LIFT. HAVE CUT BACK POPS TO CHANCE IN ALL BUT THE NORTHEASTERN 
ZONES WHERE LIKELY POPS STILL APPEAR REASONABLE. COLD FRONT STILL 
POISED TO APPROACH OVERNIGHT TONIGHT PROVIDING SOMEWHAT BETTER LIFT 
ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES. INCLUDED CATEGORICAL POPS FOR 
THAT AREA TAPERING TO LIKELY POPS IN THE CENTRAL ZONES AND CHANCE IN 
THE SOUTHERN ZONES. FRONT DEPARTS AREA THURSDAY MORNING WITH ABRUPT 
DECREASE IN MOISTURE FOLLOWING FRONT AS TROUGH AXIS SWINGS THROUGH. 
TEMPS EXPECTED TO COOL SIGNIFICANTLY BY THURSDAY.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...DRY WEATHER RETURNS
WITH SEASONABLY COOLER TEMPERATURES. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE DROPS
QUICKLY SE THURSDAY NIGHT AND EARLY FRIDAY...BUT TOO DRY FOR ANY
PRECIPITATION. W TO NW LOW LEVEL FLOW ON FRIDAY...NORTHERLY ON THE

RISE THROUGH THE PERIOD AS UPPER RIDGE OVER THE PLAINS STATES
BUILDS EASTWARD. 

THIS KEEPS TEMPS GENERALLY NEAR NORMAL FOR MID OCTOBER...WITH

.DISCUSSION...
UPPER LOW OVER WEST TN IS PROGRESSING SLOWLY TO THE EAST. A LINE OF
SHOWERS OVER SRN MIDDLE TN AND NRN AL WILL AFFECT OUR AREA AFTER
MIDNIGHT. EXPECT THIS LINE TO WEAKEN AS THE ATMOSPHERE STABILIZES A
BIT AFTER SUNSET...BUT THUNDER WILL REMAIN A POSSIBILITY OVERNIGHT
AS MODELS INDICATE ELEVATED INSTABILITY IN OUR SOUTHERN SECTIONS.
THE CURRENT FORECAST END THE CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS AT
MIDNIGHT...BUT WILL UPDATE TO EXTEND THIS CHANCE IN SOUTHERN AREAS
THROUGH THE NIGHT. HOURLY TEMPERATURES WILL NEED SOME
ADJUSTMENT...BUT FORECAST LOWS LOOK REASONABLE AND IN LINE WITH
LATEST GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LOW TRACKING THROUGH THE 
REGION TONIGHT. DEEPEST MOISTURE SHOULD MOVE INTO THE AREA LATE 
TONIGHT SO WILL KEEP HIGHEST CHANCES AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT. MODELS 
INDICATING SOME INSTABILITY TONIGHT. WILL ADD LOW CHANCE FOR 
THUNDERSTORMS FOR TONIGHT. NO SEVERE WEATHER IS EXPECTED TONIGHT. 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ALL SIMILAR SO STAYED CLOSE. THE AREA OF LOW 
PRESSURE MOVES OUT OF THE AREA EARLY WEDNESDAY WHICH IS FOLLOWED 
CLOSELY BY A COLD FRONT APPROACHING THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 
WITH DEEP MOISTURE EXPECTED...WILL KEEP LIKELY POPS INTO WEDNESDAY. 
SOME INSTABILITY IS ALSO EXPECTED SO WILL ADD THUNDER FOR WEDNESDAY. 
NO SEVERE WEATHER IS EXPECTED. WITH THE EXTRA CLOUDS...STAYED MORE 
TOWARD BLEND TEMPERATURES FOR HIGHS ON WEDNESDAY.  



.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN
DECENT AGREEMENT THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH MORE SOLUTION
DIVERGENCE LATE IN THE LONG TERM PERIOD. COLD FRONT WILL PUSH EAST
OF THE AREA BY EARLY THURSDAY...AS UPPER TROUGH DIGS IN. WILL BUMP
POPS UP TO CATEGORICAL NORTH...WITH LIKELY FOR MOST OF THE
REMAINDER OF THE AREA WED NIGHT. ALSO LOOKS UNSTABLE ENOUGH TO
INCLUDE THUNDER FOR WED NIGHT. AFTER SOME LINGERING SHOWERS EARLY
THURSDAY NORTHEAST ZONES...SHOULD SEE CLEARING AS COLDER/DRIER AIR
WORKS IN. APPEARS SECONDARY ENERGY MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER TROUGH
WILL STAY TO OUR SOUTH...SO LOOKS DRY THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH AT
LEAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. ECMWF TRIES TO BRING WEEK FRONT INTO THE
AREA BY TUESDAY...WHILE GFS SHOWS MORE VIGOROUS/SLOWER SYSTEM THAT
ARRIVES AFTER TUESDAY. FOR NOW WILL KEEP THINGS DRY MONDAY AND
TUESDAY...BUT CONFIDENCE LOWER FOR LAST FEW PERIODS OF THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SAME PERSISTENT SURFACE AND UPPER 
RIDGE WILL PROVIDE YET ANOTHER SUNNY AND WARM DAY FOR THE REGION...
WITH RECORD HIGHS POSSIBLE IN A FEW SPOTS. CHA MOST LIKELY SPOT... 
WHERE THE RECORD HIGH OF 87 DEGREES IN 1954 LOOKS IN JEOPARDY. WILL 
INCLUDE NEAR RECORD HIGH WORDING FOR ALL GROUPS AS OTHER MOS SITES 
WOULD APPEAR TO ALSO BE CLOSE. TYS RECORD IS 86 IN 1954...AND TRI
RECORD IS 85 SET IN 1954 AND 1970. 

FOR TONIGHT...MODELS SUGGEST A SLIGHT INCREASE IN MAINLY HIGH LEVEL 
CLOUDINESS OR PATCHY MID DECK BEFORE DAYBREAK TUESDAY. OTHERWISE...
MOS MAX TEMPS LOOKED QUITE GOOD FOR TODAY AND WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED. 
GFS MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT ONCE AGAIN LOOKED TOO COOL...SO I STAYED 
CLOSER TO A BLEND WITH THE MILDER NAM MOS MINS.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...CHANGES WITH CURRENT WEATHER
PATTERN WILL BEGIN TUESDAY. UPPER LOW NOW OVER CENTRAL PLAINS MOVES
EAST WITH MOISTURE SPREADING INTO THE TN VALLEY. CLOUDS WILL BE
INCREASING AND HIGHS SHOULD BE HELD DOWN A FEW DEGREES EXCEPT
POSSIBLY IN FAR EASTERN AND NORTHEAST SECTIONS. UPPER LOW OPENS UP 
AS NEW TROUGH DIGS SOUTH ACROSS EASTERN STATES. LOW PRESSURE AREA AND
WEAK COLD FRONT MOVES INTO WESTERN TN VALLEY BY TUESDAY EVENING.
ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS LOW AND COLD
FRONT WEAKENS AS NEW TROUGH DEVELOPS TO THE NW AND DIGS SOUTH INTO
OHIO VALLEY. NEW STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH EARLY
THURSDAY WITH RAIN CHANCES ENDING BY EVENING. MUCH COOLER
TEMPERATURES THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE AND NW FLOW MOVES
INTO FORECAST AREA. SUNNY AND SEASONABLE TEMPERATURES CONTINUE
THROUGH THE WEEKEND.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
859 PM EDT WED OCT 6 2010

.DISCUSSION...
MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS THE POSSIBILITY OF FROST THURSDAY MORNING.
SURFACE RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL ALLOW WINDS TO 
DECOUPLE...ESPECIALLY ACROSS SHELTERED VALLEYS. A FAIRLY WIDE
OVERNIGHT LOW TEMPERATURE RANGE IS EXPECTED. EVEN THOUGH MOST OF
THE AIRPORT STATIONS MAY NOT SEE TEMPERATURES BELOW 40 DEGREES...
OUTLYING AREAS (ESPECIALLY SHELTERED VALLEYS) WILL LIKELY
EXPERIENCE LOWS IN THE MID AND UPPER 30S...WHICH WILL ALLOW FROST
TO FORM.

CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD AND NO CHANGES PLANNED.

MODIFIED GRIDS TO RAISE TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY. WITH UPWARD TREND AT

THERE WILL BE A DECREASING CLOUD TREND AS UPPER LOW SHIFTS A LITTLE

NOT MUCH CHANGE TO THE PATTERN FOR THE SHORT TERM.  WILL CONTINUE TO 
SEE MORE CLOUDS NORTH THAN SOUTH...ALONG WITH SOME ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED SHOWERS MAINLY NORTH.  TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO BE ON THE 
COOL SIDE AS WELL.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO ONLY 
SOME MINOR ADJUSTMENTS.  

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...OHIO VALLEY UPPER LOW WILL
CONTINUE TO PLAGUE THE FORECAST AREA WITH BELOW NORMAL
TEMPERATURES...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN SECTIONS THROUGH
TUESDAY NIGHT. SHORT WAVE FEATURES WILL ROTATE AROUND THE LOW
PRESSURE CIRCULATION GENERATING SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE ON TUESDAY. BY WEDNESDAY...THE
UPPER LOW WILL HAVE DRIFTED A LITTLE FARTHER NORTHEAST ALLOWING FOR
A SLOW IMPROVEMENT TO MILDER AND DRIER WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA. HELD ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR SHOWERS ACROSS THE
HIGHER TERRAIN IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS A FAIR AMOUNT OF MOISTURE
AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT WILL STILL BE POSITIONED ACROSS THIS REGION DUE
TO THE PROXIMITY OF THE LOW. BY THURSDAY THE LOW WILL HAVE SHIFTED
FAR ENOUGH AWAY FROM THE AREA FOR REMOVAL OF POPS ALONG WITH A
LITTLE MORE SUNSHINE. MODEL PROGS DO SHOW A WEAK COLD FRONTAL
BOUNDARY SLIPS SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATE THURSDAY
AND THURSDAY NIGHT SO THERE COULD BE A FEW CLOUDS IN ASSOCIATION
WITH THIS FRONT. DON'T EXPECT ANY PRECIP WITH THE FROPA HOWEVER.
STAYED WITH THE IDEA OF A GREAT FALL WEEKEND COMPLETE WITH A
WARMING TREND AS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE
EASTERN U.S.

VERY LITTLE PRECIP. BEST CHANCES OF A LIGHT SHOWER WILL BE IN THE

BETTER PRECIP CHANCES MAY COME TOMORROW ONCE THE UPPER LOW GETS
CLOSED OFF OVER ERN KY. COLD TEMPS ALOFT WITH THIS LOW SHOULD
PRODUCE SCATTERED SHOWERS IN NORTHERN SECTIONS. TEMPERATURES

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROF WILL CONTINUE TO DIG 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS SUNDAY INTO 
MONDAY DEEPENING INTO AN UPPER LOW. DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES TO THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST PREFERRING TO HOLD ONTO A 
SLIGHT THROUGH SMALL CHANCE FOR A SHOWER ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH HIGHEST PROBABILITY ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. LATER MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY 
THE UPPER LOW BEGINS A WEAKENING TREND AND SLOWLY RETREATS BACK TO 
THE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN REGION. DURING THIS 
PERIOD DROPPED POPS BACK IN COVERAGE HOLDING ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR A SHOWER ACROSS A SMALL PART OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS DRIER AIR 
BUILDS IN BEHIND THE DEPARTING UPPER LOW. KEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
THE UPPER LEVEL CLOSED LOW OVER NORTHERN AL TODAY IS SHOWN BY THE
MODELS TO DROP SOUTHEAST TOWARD CENTRAL GA TONIGHT...WHILE THE LOW
LEVEL CIRCULATION TRACKS FROM THE SC COAST ACROSS EASTERN NC. THIS
SHOULD RESULT IN A DEEPER EASTERLY WIND COMPONENT OVER THE
APPALACHIANS...ALLOWING PRECIP TO MOVE INTO OUR EASTERN COUNTIES
THIS EVENING. THERE ARE FAIRLY LARGE DIFFERENCES IN POP BETWEEN THE
NAM AND GFS MOS. WILL LEAN TOWARD THE WETTER NAM AND HAVE LIKELY
POPS IN THE EASTERN-MOST COUNTIES...DECREASING QUICKLY TO NO POPS
IN THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. THE UPPER LOW LIFTS NORTHWARD ACROSS THE
APPALACHIANS ON THURSDAY. WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SHOWERS IN THE
NORTH AND EAST AS THE LOW DEPARTS AND DRIER AIR MOVES IN. THERE
SHOULD BE A BIG DIFFERENCE IN HIGH TEMPS TOMORROW FROM NORTH TO
SOUTH DUE TO CLOUD COVER...HIGHS WILL BE NEAR 80 AT CHATTANOOGA TO
THE 60S IN SW VA.

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
WELL ADVERTISED UPPER CLOSED LOW WILL MOVE OUT OF THE AREA
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AND POPS TAIL OFF THROUGH THE WEEKEND,
PRETTY MUCH. WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FOR LATER SUNDAY AND MONDAY. DRYING
TREND AGAIN FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED. TEMPS/WINDS LOOK
GOOD, WILL LEAVE ALONE.

QUESTION ON EVERYONE'S MIND: WILL THE TROPICAL STORM AFFECT THE

KEEP THE FORECAST AREA UNDER FAVORABLE SYNOPTIC LIFT TODAY.
ASSOCIATED 90-100KT UPPER JET WILL PRODUCE DIVERENCE ALOFT OVER THE REGION
AS WELL AS STRONG Q-VECTOR FORCING (LARGE SCALE ASCENT).

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE GREAT TN VALLEY...EMANATING FROM A WEAK 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER CENTRAL GA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT A STRONG CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW OVER WEST TN WILL DRIFT 
EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY TODAY. THIS UPPER LOW WILL 
CREATE STRONG DIVERGENCE ALOFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH WILL 
IN TURN STRENGTHEN THE SURFACE LOW AS IT MOVES OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. MODELS INDICATE A WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...SO WILL MENTION SCATTERED TSTORMS... 
BUT EXPECT SHOWERS TO BE THE DOMINANT PRECIP TYPE. WITH A LONG- 
DURATION SOAKING RAINFALL EXPECTED...WILL PLAN TO CANCEL THE FLOOD 
WATCH FOR SOUTHWEST NC SINCE RAINFALL AMOUNTS ARE NOT EXPECTED TO BE 
HIGH ENOUGH (OR OCCUR QUICKLY ENOUGH) TO WARRANT ANY FLOODING 
CONCERNS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS UPPER LOW WILL MOVE 
NORTHEAST TONIGHT...WITH THE COVERAGE OF RAIN SLOWLY DECREASING FROM 
THE SOUTHWEST. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE A CATEGORY 
COOLER THAN THE GFS NUMBERS WITH MAXES TODAY...AND WILL PLAN TO 
FOLLOW CLOSE TO THEM SINCE THIS HAS BEEN THE VERIFYING TREND LATELY. 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MINS FOR TONIGHT AND 
LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A PRETTY STABLE MERIDIONAL 
PATTERN HAS ESTABLISHED ITSELF OVER THE CONTINENT...WITH THE UPPER 
TROF OVER THE EAST AND STRONG RIDGE OVER THE WEST. UPPER TROF HAS 
BEEN PRETTY TIGHT...BUT IS OPENING UP AND WILL CONTINUE TO DO SO 
DURING THE EXTENDED PERIOD. THE RIDGE DOES NOT...IN FACT...APPEAR TO 
MAKE MUCH PROGRESS TOWARD OUR AREA...IN THE GFS. THE ECMWF TOWARDS 
NEXT WEEKEND DOES DIG ANOTHER DEEP TROF OVER US...BUT WE'LL LET THAT 
TAKE CARE OF ITSELF WHEN WE GET CLOSER. FOR NOW...THE GFS HAS DONE A 
PRETTY GOOD JOB OF DEPICTING TIMING. THE RAINS WE DID GET DID NOT 
MEASURE UP TO THE COPIOUS AMOUNTS ADVERTISED...AND THE MODELS ARE 
SHOWING A RAPIDLY DEPARTING TROF AND ASSOCIATED RH...SO I HAVE 
DECREASED THE POPS AGAIN FOR TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT...AND REMOVED 
THEM ALTOGETHER ON WEDNESDAY. ALSO REDUCED QPF VALUES. TEMPS ARE A 
LITTLE DIVERGENT IN THE MODELS...AND I HAVE ACTUALLY RAISED THE 
MAXES A HAIR EARLY ON FOR THE AMOUNT OF SUNSHINE I EXPECT. STILL... 
WITH FALL HERE AND EXPECTING TO BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A FAIRLY 
STRONG SURFACE HIGH...I PULLED BACK ON THE STRENGTH OF THE WARMING 
TREND DEPICTED IN THE MOS GUIDANCE. WITH A SERIES OF OFFSHORE LOWS 
ZIPPING UP THE COAST...AND THE SURFACE TO OUR WEST...IT LOOKS LIKE A 
GOOD POSSIBILITY OF A TIGHT-ISH SURFACE PRESSURE GRADIENT...AND IT 
MIGHT GET A TAD BREEZY ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

MONDAY NIGHT RAIN TAPERS OFF AS UPPER LOW WEAKENS AND MOVES NE.
TUESDAY STILL SHOWERS POSSIBLE NE HALF CLOSER TO UPPER LOW. TEMPERATURES
WILL REMAIN COOL MONDAY AND TUESDAY. SLIGHTLY WARMER TUESDAY WITH
SOME PARTIAL CLEARING SOUTH.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY WILL BE DROPPING INTO THE BACK SIDE OF EASTERN STATES UPPER 
TROF TUESDAY NIGHT BUT THIS FEATURE IS MOVING SEVERAL HOURS FASTER 
THAN PREVIOUS FORECAST THINKING SO REDUCED POP TO SLIGHT CHANCE AND 
APPLIED ONLY TO THE NORTHEASTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. WAS ABLE 
TO KEEP THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST DRY AS THE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW 
WILL NOT BE TERRIBLY ACTIVE IN TERMS OF THE PASSAGE OF SHORTER 
WAVELENGTH SYSTEMS AND THERE SHOULD NOT BE A TREMENDOUS AMOUNT OF 
CLOUD COVER DURING THE PERIOD. MORE ACTIVE WEATHER WILL OCCUR 
SOUTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA AS A CUT OFF LOW DEVELOPS OVER 
SOUTHERN GEORGIA AND NORTHERN FLORIDA. TEMPERATURES WILL FEEL MORE 
FALL LIKE IN THE EXTENDED PART OF THE FORECAST DUE TO THE LENGTHY 
PERIOD OF NORTHERLY WIND FLOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY GENERALLY ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE 
OVER NORTHEAST GA AND UPSTATE SC. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
A HIGHLY AMPLIFIED UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
NATION WILL DEEPEN INTO A CUT-OFF LOW ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY 
TONIGHT. THIS UPPER LOW WILL PRODUCE STRONG UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS AND 
SYNOPTIC-SCALE LIFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN 
A FAIRLY WIDESPREAD AND LONG-DURATION RAINFALL. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
REVEAL A FAIRLY STABLE AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD RESULT IN MOSTLY SHOWERS. HOWEVER...THE 
STRONG UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL LIKELY CREATE SOME 
SCATTERED TSTORMS WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IN 
SOME AREAS. IN FACT...SEVERAL INCHES OF RAIN APPEAR TO BE POSSIBLE 
ACROSS SOUTHWEST NC...ESPECIALLY IF THE WETTER GFS MODEL SOLUTION 
VERIFIES. ALTHOUGH FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES ARE VERY HIGH ACROSS 
THIS AREA (DUE TO THE RECENT ABNORMALLY DRY CONDITIONS)...WILL PLAN 
TO ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR THIS AREA SINCE A WIDESPREAD AND LONG- 
DURATION RAINFALL OF TWO TO FOUR INCHES APPEARS LIKELY...WITH SOME 
LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS POSSIBLE WITH A FEW TSTORMS. AS FOR TEMPS... 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER THAN THE GFS GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...WHICH SEEMS ODD CONSIDERING THE GFS 
IS THE WETTER OF THE TWO MODELS. WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE 
TWO WITH MAXES TODAY...BUT WILL TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER GFS MINS 
FOR TONIGHT WITH DEWPOINTS ALREADY HIGH AND NO COLD AIR ADVECTION 
EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...NO SIGNIFICANT CHANGES FROM 
PREVIOUS FORECAST. EXPECT UPPER TROF TO DEPART SLOWLY TO THE 
NORTHEAST THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WOULD DEPART MORE QUICKLY...BUT FOR A 
VORT LOBE DOWN THE WEST SIDE OF TROF WHICH WILL DIG OVER AREA 
THROUGH THURSDAY. AIR MASS WILL BE DRY AND NOT ABLE TO SUSTAIN 
PRECIP PAST WEDNESDAY BUT DESPITE LACK OF MOISTURE...DIGGING TROF 
WILL PREVENT A STRONG WARMING TREND.

STILL LOOKING FOR SOME MODERATE TO LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS MONDAY... 
TAPERING OFF TUESDAY. STREAMFLOWS ARE DOWN FOR THE MOST PART AND SO 
ONLY LOCALIZED FLOODING A POSSIBILITY. IN FACT..WITH A D-ZERO 
ABNORMAL DRYNESS IN THE MOUNTAINS...AND EVEN SOME D1 MINOR DROUGHT

MOST OF THE DAY BUT ARE BEGINNING TO SHOW BREAKS ACROSS THE
NORTHERN SECTIONS. COMPLEX FORECAST THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS AS FRONT
MOVES A LITTLE FARTHER EAST AND THEN DIGGING TROUGH OVER THE MIDWEST
FORMS AN UPPER LOW THAT DROPS SOUTH INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY AND
THAN SLOWLY MOVES EAST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. LOW PRESSURE IS
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP TO THE SW OF THE FORECAST AREA ALONG THE

UPPER LOW WILL MOVE SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE TN VALLEY AT THE SAME

NEXT FORECAST CYCLE MAY NEED TO ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH FOR THAT TIME
PERIOD. TEMPERATURES WILL BE MILD AT NIGHT AND MUCH COOLER DURING

LINE OF CONVECTION WILL DIMINISH THIS MORNING AS IT SLOWLY PUSHES

SHOULD BECOME ISOLATED AND CLOUDS SHOULD SCATTER BY THE AFTERNOON 
HOURS...AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES INTO THE CAROLINAS. UPPER-LEVEL FLOW 
THEN BECOMES MORE AMPLIFIED OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION BY 
TONIGHT...WITH A CUT-OFF UPPER LOW DEVELOPING OVER THE MID MS VALLEY 
BY SUNRISE SUNDAY MORNING. AS A RESULT...MODELS REVEAL STRENGTHENING 
DIVERGENCE ALOFT INCREASING THE LIFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...WITH SHOWERS AND A FEW EMBEDDED TSTORMS EXPECTED TO 
SLOWLY INCREASE IN COVERAGE. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL 
TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER GFS MOS NUMBERS WHERE DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT NOW OVER MIDDLE 
TENNESSEE WILL ENTER AND EXIT THE AREA BY SUNDAY. THIS WILL REDUCE 
TEMPS BACK TO MORE NORMAL VALUES...BUT NOT MUCH ELSE FOR NOW. UPPER 
TROF OVER MIDWEST WILL DESCEND INTO AREA...DEPENDING ON WHETHER YOU 
LIKE THE EUROPEAN OR GFS...BY LATE SUNDAY OR MONDAY. GFS IS NOT AS 
DEEP CORED...BUT DOES DIG FURTHER SOUTH. GFS HAS STRONGER RETURN 
FLOW IN FORM OF INVERTED TROF MOVING NORTH ON MONDAY...AND WILL GO 
WITH THIS IDEA. COPIOUS TROPICAL MOISTURE BECOMES AVAILABLE WITH 
THIS SYSTEM...AND SO WILL STAY WITH IDEA OF COVERAGE WORDING INSTEAD 
OF POSSIBILITY WORDING FOR POPS MONDAY AND TUESDAY. THE IDEA OF A 
HUGE FORECAST BUST HAS COME UP WITH THE POPS INTO THE LIKELY/

POSSIBLE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION LEADING TO LOCALIZED FLOODING... 
RATHER THAN WAITING UNTIL THE LAST MINUTE AND SUDDENLY SPRINGING

.DISCUSSION...TYPICAL PATCHES OF DENSE FOG NOTED ON VISIBLE 
SATELLITE PICS THIS MORNING...IN VALLEYS NEAR A FEW OF THE LARGER 
BODIES OF WATER...AND A LOT OF GROUND FOG NOTED LOCALLY. THIS FOG IS 
DISSIPATING AND SHOULD GIVE WAY TO MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES AND ANOTHER 
SUMMER LIKE DAY. PERHAPS LAST CHANCE FOR ANOTHER 90 DEGREE PLUS MAX 
TEMP? 

12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS WARMING ALOFT DUE TO SUBSIDENCE FROM BUILDING 
UPPER RIDGE...WHILE MODIFIED 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS BOTH SHOW 
MUCH LESS POSITIVE CAPE THAN YESTERDAY (500 J/KG OR SO). ANY 
CONVECTION SHOULD MAINLY HOLD OFF UNTIL LATER TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE 
WEAK COLD FRONT.

LATEST NAM MODEL STILL QUITE DRY WITH THE FRONT AND EVEN THE 06Z GFS 
MODEL RUN SHOWS THE WEAK NATURE OF THE APPROACHING FRONT...SO DON'T 
EXPECT A LOT OF MOISTURE CONVERGENCE. BEST RAIN CHANCES OVER OUR 
AREA SHOULD BE LATE TONIGHT AND EARLY SATURDAY...THEN SHIFTING 
QUICKLY TO THE EAST AND SOUTH OF OUR FORECAST AREA BY SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON. WILL VIEW 12Z MODEL RUNS AND RE-EVALUATE POPS FOR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC CREATING A 
SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WITH A STRONG LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM AND ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE OHIO AND 
TN RIVER VALLEYS THIS AFTERNOON...AND THEN MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA TONIGHT. MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE WILL BE FAIRLY LIMITED WITH 
THE FRONT...SO WILL CONTINUE MENTIONING LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
TONIGHT...AND MAINLY AFTER MIDNIGHT. ANOTHER UNSEASONABLY WARM DAY 
IS EXPECTED TODAY...WITH CLOUDS GRADUALLY INCREASING THROUGHOUT THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS AS THE FRONT APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR 
TEMPS...WILL GENERALLY FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE FORECAST FOR TODAY AND 
TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...CHANGE OF PATTERN FROM HOT 
AND DUSTY TO MORE UNSETTLED, WITH A RATHER WEAK COLD FRONT LATE 
SATURDAY INTO EARLY SUNDAY, BUT THEN AN INVERTED TROF MOVES NORTH 
INTO THE AREA LATER SUNDAY AND MONDAY BRINGING ATLANTIC MOISTURE 
INTO THE REGION FROM THE EAST.

HAVE ALMOST DOUBLED POPS DURING THE FIRST PART OF THE PERIOD AS THE 
MODELS HAVE COME MUCH CLOSER IN AGREEMENT. THAT SAID, THE GFS 
APPEARS TO ME TO BE THE BEST LOOK AT PRECIP AMOUNTS AND LOCATIONS, 
SO WENT WITH IT, LARGELY, WITH SOME ADJUSTMENTS DOWN ON QPF AMOUNTS. 
STILL, THINK THAT MOST OF SUNDAY/MONDAY WILL BE RATHER WET, CLOUDY, 
AND LOOK A LOT LIKE AN OCCLUDED AIRMASS. SOME INSTABILITY WILL ALLOW 
FOR THUNDERSTORMS. RATHER THAN GET FANCY WITH WORDING THAT FAR OUT, 
WENT WITH UNCERTAINTY WORDING THROUGH SATURDAY/EARLY SUNDAY, AND 
THEN COVERAGE WORDING SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

TEMPS? ADJUSTED A DEGREE OR TWO DOWN OR UP DEPENDING ON PERIOD TO 
MATCH GUIDANCE A LITTLE BETTER, BUT DID NOT CHANGE CATS.

DID NOT ADJUST GRIDS PERCEPTIBLY FROM WEDNESDAY ON OUT, AS BEHAVIOR 
OF TROPICAL SYSTEM WILL HAVE TO BE WATCHED CLOSELY.

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...RANDOM FLAT CUMULUS CLOUDS 
DEVELOPING THIS AFTERNOON OVER THE EASTERN MTNS AND PLATEAU AREAS.
WATER VAPOR SATELLITE PICS SHOW DRY AIR SPREADING IN AS HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS ALOFT TODAY...SO KEPT FORECAST DRY FOR TONIGHT. MAY 
SEE A FEW SPOTS OF FOG ALONG/NEAR BODIES OF WATER...AS ALREADY NOTED 
IN FORECAST GRIDS. A MOS BLEND LOOKED GOOD FOR MINS TONIGHT.

WEAK SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT COME INTO PLAY BY LATE 
FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...THEN THE FORECAST BECOMES MUCH MORE COMPLEX 
AS THE UPPER LOW DROPS INTO MID MS VALLEY AND CLOSES OFF. THE 12Z 
GFS/00Z ECMWF ARE PREFERRED MODELS IN THE MEDIUM RANGE...WITH THE 
12Z NAM THE DRIEST WITH THE WEAK SHORTWAVE/FRONT FOR FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY. IF NAM SOLUTION IS CORRECT...THEN ALMOST NO CONVECTION 
OCCURS FRIDAY NIGHT OR SATURDAY. HOWEVER...GFS AND ECMWF SUGGEST 
SCATTERED WEAKENING CONVECTION FRIDAY NIGHT...THEN SOME DEVELOPMENT 
AGAIN DURING PEAK HEATING ON SATURDAY. THUS...I KEPT 20 TO 30 
PERCENT POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND 30 TO 40 PERCENT POPS FOR SATURDAY 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

FRIDAY WOULD APPEAR TO BE PERHAPS ONE OF THE LAST CHANCES TO REACH 
90 DEGREES OR HIGHER...AS MOISTURE REMAINS QUITE SHALLOW UNTIL 
FRIDAY NIGHT. DEEPENING MOISTURE ON SATURDAY AND BEYOND SHOULD DROP 
MAX TEMPS TO NEAR CLIMO AFTER 80S ON SATURDAY. MOS GUIDANCE WAS 
CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...THIS PERIOD SHOULD BE 
RATHER UNSETTLED. WENT CLOSER TO THE GFS ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE 
FORECAST. SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY MOISTURE AND LIFT WILL BE ON 
THE INCREASE AS UPPER TROUGH/CLOSED LOW DROP SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. AS THE UPPER 
LOW DEEPENS AND SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST...A SURFACE LOW AND COLD FRONT 
WILL DRIVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. ADJUSTED POPS FROM 
MEDIUM TO HIGH CHANCE BY SUNDAY NIGHT MONDAY IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
THESE FEATURES' SLOW PROGRESSION TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. ADDITIONAL SHORT WAVE ENERGY DROPS INTO THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
UPPER TROF MAINTAINING THE DEPTH OF THE LOW AND SLOWING ITS TREK 
ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. USED A GRADUAL DROP IN PROBABILITIES FROM 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS THIS LARGE PRESSURE SYSTEM LUMBERS 
EAST. ANOTHER NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROF WILL DIVE SOUTHEAST OUT OF 
THE WESTERN CANADIAN PROVINCES INTO THE UPPER MIDWEST BY MIDWEEK 
PUSHING MORE COOL AIR TOWARD THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. APPLIED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP FOR POSSIBLE CONVECTION AHEAD OF THIS FRONT ON THURSDAY. 
COULD BE ANOTHER WET PERIOD AS A TROPICAL SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO SHIFT 
NORTH INTO THE GULF OF MEXICO TOWARD THE END OF NEXT WEEK.

MODEL MORE UNSTABLE THAN GFS WITH A FEW AREAS OF SHOWER ACTIVITY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE BOTH AT THE
SURFACE AND ALOFT HAS SHIFTED A LITTLE FARTHER EAST...OFF THE NORTH
CAROLINA COAST THIS MORNING. THIS HAS ALLOWED INCREASING GULF
MOISTURE TO STREAM NORTH FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO THROUGH AL AND GA
INTO THE EASTERN TN VALLEY. ISOLATED SHOWERS AND A FEW
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE DEVELOPED OVERNIGHT ACROSS MAINLY THE PLATEAU
COUNTIES BUT IN THE PAST HOUR NEAR CHA. SKIES ARE PARTLY CLOUDY
WITH SOME PATCHY FOG AND MILD TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 60S TO MID
70S. ACTUALLY VERY WARM FOR THIS TIME OF MORNING IN LATE SEPTEMBER.
HARD TO BELIEVE FALL STARTS TONIGHT.

WILL CONTINUE ISOLATED TO CHANCE SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY.
ALSO RAISED MAX TEMPERATURES A FEW DEGREES TO RECORD OR NEAR RECORD
READINGS IN THE UPPER 80S TO MID 90S ABOUT THE SAME AS TUESDAY
NORTH AND A COUPLE DEGREES COOLER SOUTH DUE TO MORE CLOUD COVER.
WITH SUCH A WARM START THIS MORNING AND HIGH DEW POINTS IN THE MID
60S IT MAY NOT TAKE LONG FOR TEMPERATURES TO REACH THE MID 80S AND
HIGHER. NO REAL CHANGES TONIGHT WITH A FEW SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS IN THE EVENING BEFORE CLEARING SKIES. LOWS TONIGHT
SHOULD BE COOLER AS TEMPERATURES DROP TO NEAR THE DEW POINT. DID
NOT PUT FOG IN BUT THIS MAY HAVE TO BE ADDED. QPF AMOUNTS NOT
EXPECTED TO BE HEAVY BUT SOME PLACES HAVE RECEIVED LOCALLY HIGH
AMOUNTS WITH SLOW MOVING THUNDERSTORMS ALREADY.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...RIDGING FROM THE ATLANTIC 
WILL BUILD BACK INTO THE AREA THU AND FRI. WELL ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE WITH DRY CONDITIONS. LARGE SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES RAPIDLY THROUGH THE NORTHERN GREAT LAKES FRI 
AND SAT. TRAILING FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL WEAKEN AS IT MOVES SE 
THROUGH THE TN RVR VLY AND ARRIVE IN E TN LATE FRI/EARLY SAT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...MODELS/SREF REMAIN IN 
REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. TRANQUIL 
CONDITIONS EXPECTED TO GENERALLY PERSIST THROUGH TONIGHT AS REGION 
REMAINS UNDER INFLUENCE OF UPPER RIDGING. UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO 
SLOWLY SHIFT EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS THROUGH TOMORROW RESULTING IN 
INCREASINGLY MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. MODELS DEPICT CHANCE OF 
DIURNAL CONVECTION DEVELOPING IN THIS REGIME MAINLY IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN. THUS HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE POPS FOR MOUNTAINS WITH 
ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE FOR VALLEY LOCATIONS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID 
NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE PERSISTENT RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS WILL PROVIDE A COUPLE 
MORE DAYS OF HOT AND DRY WEATHER FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. HIGHS WILL 
CONTINUE WELL ABOVE NORMAL...IN THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S IN MOST 
SPOTS. THE RIDGE BEGINS TO BREAK DOWN ON FRIDAY NIGHT AS A SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT APPROACH THE AREA. THE EAST-WEST 
ORIENTATION OF THE DEPARTING RIDGE WILL PREVENT GULF MOISTURE FROM 
BEING TAPPED AHEAD OF THE FRONT...SO MOISTURE LOOKS LIMITED. WILL 
CONTINUE TO HAVE CHANCE POPS FOR SATURDAY AND A SLIGHT CHANCE 
SATURDAY NIGHT. 

MODELS HAVE CONVERGED ON A PATTERN OF A CLOSED LOW OVER THE EASTERN 
CONUS SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...BUT DIFFER SIGNIFICANTLY ON THE 
POSITION OF THAT LOW. THE 06Z AND 12Z GFS ARE OUTLIERS...PUTTING THE 
CLOSED LOW WEST OF THE MS RIVER AND BRINGING A LOT OF PRECIP TO OUR 
AREA FOR THE BEGINNING OF THE WEEK. THE 
CANADIAN/GEM...ECMWF...UKMET...AND THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN PUT THE 
CLOSED LOW IN THE VICINITY OF THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS WITH A GOOD 
PUNCH OF COLDER CANADIAN AIR BEHIND IT. WILL GO WITH THE MODEL 
CONSENSUS OF A CLOSED LOW TO OUR NORTHEAST...LEADING TO A DRIER AND 
COOLER FORECAST. HOWEVER CONFIDENCE IS LOW AS MODELS TEND NOT TO 
HANDLE THESE TYPES OF TRANSITIONAL PATTERNS VERY WELL.

BETTER CHANCE MOUNTAINS. MORE CLOUD COVER WILL HOLD HIGHS DOWN A

SUMMER. RIDGE RESTRENGTHENS THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH MUCH ABOVE
NORMAL TEMPERATURES AND ABUNDANT SUNSHINE. SATURDAY COLD FRONT
AHEAD OF TROUGH MOVING INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST WILL

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE FORESEEN IN 
GENERALLY TRANQUIL CONDITIONS IN SHORT TERM AS UPPER RIDGING 
CONTINUES TO BE THE DOMINANT FEATURE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION. UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT EAST...ALLOWING RETURN 
FLOW BY TUESDAY. THIS WILL PROMOTE SOME INCREASE IN MOISTURE INTO 
THE AREA BUT ONLY SLIGHT INCREASE IN CLOUD COVER ANTICIPATED AT THIS 
TIME. TEMPS WILL REMAIN WELL ABOVE CLIMO. MAV GUIDANCE APPEARS 
REASONABLE SO DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM THOSE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
WITH THE RIDGE POSITIONED OVER THE CAROLINAS...A SOUTH TO SOUTHEAST 
LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL TRANSPORT GREATER MOISTURE TOWARD THE AREA 
BEGINNING TUESDAY NIGHT. AN UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL ALSO 
APPROACH THE AREA...PROVIDING SOME WEAK LIFT ON WEDNESDAY. MODELS 
ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT SHOWING PRECIP STARTING AS EARLY AS 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND CONTINUING THROUGH WEDNESDAY. WILL HAVE SLIGHT TO 
LOW CHANCE POPS IN THIS TIME FRAME.

THE LOW TO MIDLEVEL RIDGE TO OUR EAST REMAINS NEARLY 
STATIONARY...WHILE AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA FROM 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS SHOULD KEEP DRY WEATHER AND CONTINUED HOT 
TEMPERATURES FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. A FAIRLY STRONG COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES ON SATURDAY AS THE RIDGE GIVES WAY TO A DEEPENING TROUGH 
OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THE CANADIAN AND GFS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL PATTERN AND HAVE SHOWN SOME RUN-TO-RUN 
CONSISTENCY...PUSHING THE FRONT THROUGH ON SATURDAY WITH 
COLDER/DRIER AIR BEHIND. BUT THE ECMWF SHOWS A DEEP CLOSED LOW 
DROPPING WAY SOUTH OVER THE PLAINS...STALLING THE FRONT TO NORTH AND 
PRODUCING COPIOUS AMOUNTS OF PRECIP OVER OUR AREA SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY...WHICH LOOKS SUSPICIOUS. GIVEN THE LARGE DIFFERENCES BETWEEN 
THE GFS AND ECMWF...CONFIDENCE IS LOW FOR DAYS 6 AND 7...SO WILL GO 
DRY ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH A MILD AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS OCCURRING AHEAD OF THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER SOUTHWEST VA. THESE CLOUDS MAY HELP TO LIMIT 
ANY FOG DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT...BUT WILL PLAN TO MENTION PATCHY FOG 
SINCE A FEW SITES REPORTED FOG LAST NIGHT AND TEMPS SHOULD AGAIN 
DROP CLOSE TO THE DEWPOINTS. OTHERWISE...TEMP AND WIND FORECAST

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...UPPER RIDGE TO OUR WEST WILL 
CONTINUE TO BUILD OVER THE AREA DURING THE SHORT TERM. VERY WEAK 
COLD FRONT WILL SAG TOWARD OUR AREA BEFORE DISSIPATING...PERHAPS 
EVEN INTO OUR NORTHERN ZONES...BUT SHOULD NOT BE MUCH OF A FACTOR.  
EXPECT A MOSTLY CLEAR SKY AND TEMPS CONTINUING ABOVE SEASONAL 
NORMS.  WILL GO ABOVE MAV TEMPS FOR LOWS TONIGHT...BUT WILL STAY 
CLOSE TO MAV FOR HIGHS TOMORROW.    

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS/ENSEMBLES 
DETERIORATE FROM GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE FIRST PORTION OF THE 
LONG TERM PERIOD TO PROFOUND DISAGREEMENT BY LATE IN THE PERIOD. 
MAIN DISAGREEMENT REVOLVES AROUND TIMING/SIGNIFICANCE OF FRONT THAT 
MIGRATES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SOMETIME NEXT 
WEEKEND. GFS MUCH FASTER AND STRONGER WITH THIS FEATURE THAN THE 
ECMWF MODEL. AS A RESULT...HAVE OPTED TO SPREAD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
ACROSS SEVERAL PERIODS TO ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING. 
OTHERWISE...GENERALLY BENIGN WEATHER REGIME EXPECTED TO CONTINUE 
WITH ONLY SCATTERED DIURNAL CONVECTION CONFINED MAINLY TO THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN POSSIBLE AS MOISTURE INCREASES IN RESPONSE TO SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM 
MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.AVIATION...DRY AIR ADVECTION AND RISING PRESSURE WILL KEEP VFR
FLIGHT IN PLACE THROUGH MOST OF THE TAF PERIOD. HOWEVER...RADIATION
WILL ALLOW THE SURFACE TO COOL SUFFICIENTLY LATER TONIGHT FOR
SATURATION TO OCCUR ESPECIALLY AT TRI WHERE MVFR VSBY WILL LIKELY
DETERIORATE TO LIFR WITH A MATCHING LIFR CEILING. THE FOG SHOULD
LIFT FAIRLY QUICKLY HERE WITH VFR FLIGHT BY 15Z.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...DRIER AIR MOVING INTO THE 
AREA AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.  SHOULD BE CLEAR TO MOSTLY CLEAR 
DURING THE SHORT TERM.  WILL INCLUDE SOME PATCHY FOG FOR LATE 
TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRY WEATHER PATTERN 
CONTINUES INTO MID WEEK WITH UPPER RIDGE OVER SOUTHEAST STATES. 
COMPUTER MODELS TRY TO BRING A WEAK SYSTEM AROUND RIDGE INTO THE 
MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES CLIPPING THE NE CORNER OF THE FORECAST AREA 
MONDAY FROM THE GREAT LAKES AND UPPER OHIO VALLEY WITH WEAK FRONT 
MAKING IT INTO SW VA. WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR NOW. RIDGE REBUILDS 
TUESDAY. THEN SURFACE HIGH BEGINS SHIFTING EAST WITH INCREASED 
MOISTURE FROM SOUTHERLY FLOW ESPECIALLY IN THE MOUNTAINS SO WILL 
HAVE SLIGHT POPS BY AFTERNOON. THIS PATTERN CONTINUES THROUGH 
FRIDAY. NEW COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH KY/TN BORDER FRIDAY BUT IN A 
WEAKENED STATE SO NO INCREASE IN POPS THROUGH THE EXTENDED. 
CONTINUED PATTERN OF MUCH ABOVE NORMAL HIGHS AND LOWS NEAR NORMAL 
THROUGH THE EXTENDED. INCREASED CLOUD COVER LAST 3 DAYS MAY LOWER 
HIGH TEMPERATURES AND RAISE LOWS A FEW DEGREES.

.AVIATION...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN DURING THE PERIOD...ALONG
WITH DRIER AIR. BIG QUESTION FOR THE FORECAST IS FOG DEVELOPMENT
TONIGHT. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT HOW MUCH LOW LEVEL DRYING
WILL TAKE PLACE THIS AFTERNOON...AS WELL AS IF WINDS WILL BECOME
CALM OVERNIGHT AT LEAST AT CHA AND TYS. EXPECT WINDS WILL GO CALM AT
TRI...AND THINK THAT IS THE LOCATION WITH BEST CHANCE TO SEE
SIGNIFICANT FOG...SO WILL FORECAST LIFR CONDITIONS THERE FOR A
PERIOD. NOT CONFIDENT WINDS GO CALM AT CHA OR TYS...SO WILL KEEP
THINGS VFR FOR NOW THERE...BUT CERTAINLY CANNOT RULE FOG OUT EITHER

NORTH.  WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THURSDAY AFTERNOON ALL BUT FAR 
EAST/SOUTHEAST ZONES...EXCEPT LOW CHANCE FAR NW ZONES.  
OTHERWISE...WILL JUST SEE SOME INCREASE IN CLOUDS. ALSO EXPECT SOME 
GUSTY SOUTHWEST WINDS THURSDAY. WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...THURSDAY NIGHT 
AIR MASS WILL BE UNSTABLE AHEAD OF WEAK FRONT WITH SHOWERS AND 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS JUST AHEAD OF THE FRONT. BEST DYNAMICS WILL 
STAY TO THE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA SO SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF
FORECAST AREA ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AND 30 PERCENT NORTH. BECAUSE
OF THE QUICKER SPEED OF THE FRONT HAVE REMOVED POPS OUT OF FRIDAY
MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE WILL QUICKLY BUILD IN FROM THE OHIO
VALLEY. LOWS THURSDAY NIGHT WILL BE MILD WITH INCREASED CLOUD
COVER ASSOCIATED WITH THE FRONT. MODELS HAVE LITTLE COLD AIR
ADVECTION BEHIND FRONT EVEN WITH A SHIFT IN WINDS TO THE NORTH AND
NORTHWEST. WITH THIS IN MIND HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE ABOUT THE
SAME AS THURSDAY EXCEPT A FEW DEGREES COOLER NORTH. RIDGING ALOFT
WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL FROM SATURDAY THROUGH MID WEEK OVER THE
SOUTHEAST STATES. GFS SHOWS A SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY
SUNDAY INTO MONDAY WHICH MIGHT INCREASE CLOUDS AS UPPER RIDGE
CENTER STAYS FARTHER WEST. PREFER TO FOLLOW ECMWF MODEL WHERE UPPER
RIDGE CENTER IS FARTHER EAST AND KEEPS THIS SYSTEM MUCH FARTHER
NORTH. NEW FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACHES WEDNESDAY BUT WILL KEEP
FORECAST DRY FOR NOW. LOWS WILL STAY NEAR NORMAL BUT HIGHS WILL BE
ABOVE NORMAL WITH STRONG RIDGE AND DRY AIR MASS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A FEW CLOUDS STILL BUILDING 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION IN THE WAKE OF A 
WEAK SHORT WAVE FEATURE. PRESSURE WILL REMAIN HIGH TODAY ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH LIMITED MOISTURE...ESPECIALLY IN THE LOW LEVELS. 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WELL ABOVE NORMAL AGAIN TODAY WITH HIGHS IN THE 
MID 80S NORTH TO THE LOWER 90S SOUTH. SHOULD BE ANOTHER TRANQUIL 
NIGHT TONIGHT AS MOISTURE SLOWLY INCREASES AHEAD OF PLAINS STATES 
SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. STAYED CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND 
FOR MAX/MIN TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...BY THURSDAY HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL BE CENTERED OFF THE CAROLINA COASTLINE...WITH A RIDGE AXIS 
EXTENDING ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. MEANWHILE A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL 
BE CROSSING THE GREAT LAKES...WITH AN UPPER JET STREAK OVER THE OHIO 
VALLEY. MODELS HAVE TRENDED SLIGHTLY FASTER WITH THIS TROUGH AND ITS 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT. PLATEAU COUNTIES COULD SEE SHOWERS STARTING 
THURSDAY AFTERNOON. BEST LIFT WILL BE THURSDAY NIGHT WITH THE TROUGH 
AXIS MOVING THROUGH AND THE POSITIONING OF THE UPPER JET OVER 
VIRGINIA TO ENHANCE UPPER DIVERGENCE. BUT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED 
DUE TO THE ORIENTATION OF THE RIDGE AXIS TO OUR SOUTH...PREVENTING 
GULF MOISTURE FROM BEING TAPPED. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE TO 
SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE...AND REMOVE POPS FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 

THE REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS BENIGN AS A LARGE RIDGE SETTLES OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND THE SOUTHEAST. TEMPERATURES WILL REMAIN WELL 
ABOVE NORMAL...WITH HIGHS EACH DAY IN THE 80S TO AROUND 90.

.DISCUSSION...SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH THE AREA THIS EVENING.
MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS WILL MOVE SE. SKIES WILL CLEAR AND TEMPS 
WILL DROP NICELY OVERNIGHT IN DRY AIRMASS. WARM WATERS WILL RESULT 
IN FOG FORMATION ACROSS WATERWAYS EARLY WEDNESDAY. NO UPDATE PLANNED. 

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...AN AREA OF MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS OVER THE 
WESTERN HALF OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA THIS 
EVENING...BUT OVERALL MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES WILL PREVAIL. THE CLEAR SKY 
AND CALM WINDS WILL ONCE AGAIN PRODUCE GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING. DUE 
TO THE RELATIVELY WARM WATER TEMPERATURES FROM AREA LAKES AND 
STREAMS...STEAM FOG WILL LIKELY FORM AGAIN OVERNIGHT-WEDNESDAY 
MORNING. HAVE INCLUDED PATCHY DENSE FOG.

OTHERWISE...RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL KEEP DRY AND UNSEASONABLY
WARM CONDITIONS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...A DRY FORECAST STILL 
APPEARS TO DOMINATE THESE PERIODS...OUTSIDE OF A BRIEF CHANCE OF 
RAIN LATE THURSDAY INTO EARLY FRIDAY. TIMING STILL A BIT UNCERTAIN 
...BUT THE STRONGER AND SLOWER 12Z NAM MODEL IS NOT FAVORED OVER 
REST OF MODEL SOLUTIONS/ENSEMBLES. HOWEVER...WITH BEST DYNAMICS WELL 
TO OUR NORTH CLOSER TO THE ACTUAL SHORTWAVE TRACK ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY REGIONS...PLUS FAVORED SURFACE LOW ALSO TO OUR 
NORTH...RAIN CHANCES OF ONLY 20 TO 30 PERCENT ARE JUSTIFIED FOR NOW. 
MAIN CHANGE I MADE WAS TO INTRODUCE POPS FOR NRN PLATEAU AND THE 
SEQUATCHIE VALLEY FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON...THEN TO REMOVE POPS FROM 
THE NW AREAS BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON. 

FOR REST OF THE EXTENDED...HIGH PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE...ESPECIALLY 
OVER THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK...AS A LARGE UPPER RIDGE 
SPREADS ACROSS THE SRN TWO-THIRDS OF THE NATION. THIS SHOULD KEEP 
HURRICANE IGOR OVER THE ATLANTIC OCEAN. SURFACE HIGH AND THE DRY AIR 
SHOULD ALLOW FOR A LARGE DIURNAL RANGE...WITH MIN TEMPS JUST A BIT 
ABOVE CLIMO...WHILE HIGHS RUN ABOUT 8 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE CLIMO EACH 
DAY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE OZARKS...AND 
EXTENDING ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. THIS AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY THROUGH MONDAY 
NIGHT...BRINGING DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS. WITH LINGERING GROUND 
MOISTURE FROM YESTERDAY'S RAINFALL...THINK THAT CLEAR SKIES AND 
LIGHT WINDS WILL ALLOW AREAS OF FOG TO FORM LATER TONIGHT. UPPER- 
LEVEL NORTHWEST FLOW OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION WILL PUSH A 
WEAK COLD FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY. HOWEVER... 
MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED ENOUGH FOR NO CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL 
DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE EXTENDED FOR DRY CONDITIONS AND 
SEASONAL TEMPERATURES WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. MODELS BRING A COLD 
FRONT THROUGH AROUND THE FRIDAY TIME FRAME. TIMING OF THIS FEATURE 
REMAINS IN QUESTION...BUT WILL HAVE 20 TO 30 POPS FOR THURSDAY NIGHT

AN AREA OF RAIN ASSOCIATED WITH A MIDLEVEL SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL 
CROSS THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA THIS MORNING. WILL CARRY 
CATEGORICAL POPS IN THE NORTHERN HALF THIS MORNING. 

SURFACE ANALYSIS INDICATES A SURFACE WARM FRONT LOCATED ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN TN VALLEY TO SE KY. MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS FRONT WILL 
PUSH NORTH ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. HIGH PRESSURE OVER PA/NY EXTENDS 
SOUTH ALONG THE APPALACHIANS...CREATING A SHALLOW COLD AIR DAMMING 
PATTERN IN THE TN VALLEY TODAY. MORNING RAIN WILL FURTHER ENFORCE 
THE SURFACE COLD POOL...WHICH WILL LIKELY DELAY THE NORTHWARD 
PROGRESS OF THE WARM FRONT MORE THAN THE MODELS INDICATE. WILL LEAN 
TOWARD THE COOLER NAM GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS TODAY IN THE NORTH...WITH A 
BLEND OF GUIDANCE SOUTH. SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL PORTIONS OF THE AREA 
SHOULD BE IN THE WARM SECTOR AROUND 18Z. INCREASING INSTABILITY IN 
THE AFTERNOON AND SOME SURFACE HEATING IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WILL 
RESULT IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING...AND AN UPPER JET 
NOSING INTO THE AREA WILL ENHANCE UPPER DIVERGENCE. WILL HAVE LIKELY 
POPS THROUGH THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. THE 850/700 MB TROUGH WILL 
BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT...ADVECTING DRIER AIR 
ALOFT AND TAPERING POPS BACK TO A CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE LATE.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROUGH TRACKS THROUGH THE

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. WARM FRONT
MOVING SLOWLY NORTH INTO MRX CWA. PCPN FAVORS N AREAS OVERNIGHT. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A WARM FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH...WITH THE REMNANTS OF 
TROPICAL DEPRESSION HERMINE NEAR THE CONFLUENCE OF THE OHIO AND 
MISSISSIPPI RIVERS. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF HERMINE WILL COMBINE WITH 
STRENGTHENING ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING WARM FRONT TO 
PRODUCE AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF RAINFALL ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA LATER 
TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. SINCE FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES ARE FAIRLY 
HIGH IN THIS AREA AND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO BE LOCATED 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AFTER MIDNIGHT...WILL NOT ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH AT 
THIS TIME BUT WILL MENTION 'RAIN POSSIBLY HEAVY AT TIMES' IN THE 
FORECAST. MODELS AGREE THAT A MUGGY AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL MOVE 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...AS THE WARM FRONT MOVES 
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. A COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO 
MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT...TRIGGERING ADDITIONAL 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE AND NORTHWEST 
FLOW ALOFT QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR SUNDAY AND 
SUNDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAXES ON 
SATURDAY. WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE SINCE TEMPS WILL BE HIGHLY 
DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONVECTION THAT ULTIMATELY DEVELOPS.

LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AND WILL 
CONTROL AREA WEATHER THROUGH MUCH FOR THE EXTENDED. THIS WILL 
PROVIDE DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WITH NEAR SEASONAL 
TEMPERATURES. THE ONLY CONCERN IS AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT THAT MAY 
REACH INTO THE REGION ON FRIDAY. WILL LEAVE THINGS DRY FOR NOW BUT

240 PM EDT FRI SEP 10 2010

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WARM FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH...WITH THE REMNANTS 
OF TROPICAL DEPRESSION HERMINE NEAR THE CONFLUENCE OF THE OHIO AND 
MISSISSIPPI RIVERS. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF HERMINE WILL COMBINE WITH 
STRENGTHENING ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING WARM FRONT TO 
PRODUCE AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF RAINFALL ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA LATER 
TONIGHT AFTER MIDNIGHT. SINCE FLASH FLOOD GUIDANCE VALUES ARE FAIRLY 
HIGH IN THIS AREA AND THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS EXPECTED TO BE LOCATED 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AFTER MIDNIGHT...WILL NOT ISSUE A FLOOD WATCH AT 
THIS TIME BUT WILL MENTION 'RAIN POSSIBLY HEAVY AT TIMES' IN THE 
FORECAST. MODELS AGREE THAT A MUGGY AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL MOVE 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...AS THE WARM FRONT MOVES 
NORTHWARD ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. A COLD FRONT IS THEN PROGGED TO 
MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT...TRIGGERING ADDITIONAL 
CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE AND NORTHWEST 
FLOW ALOFT QUICKLY MOVE INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR SUNDAY AND 
SUNDAY NIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST PERIOD...WITH THE EXCEPTION OF MAXES ON 
SATURDAY. WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE SINCE TEMPS WILL BE HIGHLY 
DEPENDENT ON THE AMOUNT OF CONVECTION THAT ULTIMATELY DEVELOPS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN AND 
WILL CONTROL AREA WEATHER THROUGH MUCH FOR THE EXTENDED. THIS WILL 
PROVIDE DRY AND MOSTLY CLEAR CONDITIONS WITH NEAR SEASONAL 
TEMPERATURES. THE ONLY CONCERN IS AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT THAT MAY 
REACH INTO THE REGION ON FRIDAY. WILL LEAVE THINGS DRY FOR NOW BUT

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
ACROSS CENTRAL AL AND CENTRAL GA...WITH A MORE DIFFUSE SECONDARY 
WARM FRONT BETWEEN KNOXVILLE AND THE TRI-CITIES AS EVIDENCED BY THE 
DEWPOINT GRADIENT. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME LIGHT SHOWERS OCCURRING

THIS SECONDARY WARM FRONT. THE PRIMARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE 
DEEP SOUTH IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHWARD AS A WARM FRONT THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND BECOME LOCATED OVER SOUTHEAST TN BY SUNSET. 
STRENGTHENING ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THIS WARM FRONT SHOULD HELP 
TO INCREASE THE COVERAGE OF SHOWERS THIS AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY

NOT REACHING THE GROUND. SATURATION WILL GRADUALLY EXTEND DOWN

TODAY...LEANED TOWARD THE WETTER GFS...WHICH IS MORE IN LINE WITH

EVERYWHERE...BUT HIGHEST IN THE PLATEAU COUNTIES. THE VORT MAX SEEN 
IN WV IMAGERY NEAR THE MO BOOTHEEL WILL CROSS THE AREA 
TONIGHT...ALONG WITH THETA-E ADVECTION AT 850 MB. THIS WILL KEEP THE 
RAIN CHANCES GOING THROUGH TONIGHT...WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES ACROSS 
NORTHERN AREAS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE TRICKY TODAY AND WILL BE HIGHLY 
DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW. EXPECT THAT MOST 
CENTRAL AND NORTHERN LOCATIONS WILL BE BROKEN TO OVERCAST...HOLDING 
TEMPS MAINLY IN THE 70S TO NEAR 80. SCATTERED TO BROKEN CLOUDS IN 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS SHOULD ALLOW TEMPS TO REACH THE MID TO UPPER 80S.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT TRACKING THROUGH

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...BOTTOM LINE: PLUG OF MOISTURE FROM 
TD HERMINE STILL AFFECTING REGION SO THAT DEWPOINTS HAVE NOT FALLEN 
OFF. WITHIN A FEW DAYS THEY WENT FROM LOW 40S TO UPPER 60S. BLUE 
SKIES TO HEAVY RAINS. FRONT HAS EXITED AREA AND BEEN REPLACED BY 
HIGH PRESSURE, WITH RIDGE ALOFT, BUT RIDGE IS DIRTY AND HAS SMALL 
WAVES MOVING OVER TOP OF IT, LIKELY ASSOCIATED WITH THE PATHETIC 
REMNANTS OF HERMINE. THERE IS ENOUGH RH TO KEEP CLOUDS IN BUT NOT 
ENOUGH LIFT AND SUPPORT FOR SHOWERS. AMS WILL BE MUGGY AND WARM WITH 
LIGHT WINDS. BECAUSE OF RAGGED HOLES IN THE CLOUD COVER IN THE 
CENTRAL THIRD HAVE ADDED SOME PATCH FOG THIS MORNING. IN THE 
NORTHEAST THIRD, AREAS OF DENSE FOG. TOO MANY CLOUDS IN THE 
SOUTHWEST THIRD FOR FOG. EXPECT WARM BLEND TEMPS TODAY AND UNDERCUT 
BLEND TEMPS TONIGHT BY A DEGREE OR SO.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...EARLY PERIODS ARE DEPENDENT 
ON THE REMNANT MOISTURE FROM TROPICAL STORM HERMINE...WITH GFS AND 
NAM LIKELY TOO DRY FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...NOT ACCOUNTING FOR 
THIS MOISTURE. A BLEND OF THE 12Z ECMWF/UKMET/CANADIAN ARE FAVORED 
BY HPC...AND THE ECMWF DOES ADVECT MOISTURE (HIGH SURFACE TO 850 MB 
THETA-E) EASTWARD INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY.
THE UPPER RIDGE WILL BE BUILDING ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...SUCH 
THAT STEERING WINDS WOULD SEND ANY CONVECTION E OR SE TOWARD OUR 
REGION. THUS...IN SPITE OF LOW 09/00Z MOS POPS...I KEPT PREVIOUS 
POP/WX GRIDS INTACT WITH CHANCE POPS FROM FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT.

GREATEST RAIN CHANCES (TSRA) SHOULD OCCUR BY SATURDAY EVENING AS 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT APPROACH...AND I WAS 
TEMPTED TO NUDGE POPS UP TO LIKELY FOR SATURDAY NIGHT. HOWEVER...
STAYING BELOW 60 PERCENT WAS A BETTER MESH WITH NWS NEIGHBORS GRIDS
SO KEPT POPS AT 50 PERCENT WITH SCATTERED WORDING FOR NOW. EXPECT 
GENERAL NON-SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS...UNLESS UPPER TROUGH WERE TO 
AMPLIFY MORE. DRY FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY...AS A FLAT W-NW FLOW ALOFT DEVELOPS...AND WEAK NORTHERLY 
LOW LEVEL FLOW OCCURS WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE.

245 PM EDT WED SEP 8 2010

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM NEAR ROANOKE SOUTHWEST 
TO NEAR CROSSVILLE AND MEMPHIS...WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS IN THE MID TO 
UPPER 60S ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
SLOWLY MOVE SOUTHWARD AND BE COMPLETELY THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY 
SUNSET...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF 
THE NATION. THUS...WILL GO WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR TONIGHT. DRIER 
AND SLIGHTLY COOLER AIR WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
THURSDAY...WITH HIGH CLOUDS FROM THE REMNANTS OF HERMINE CONTINUING 
TO MOVE EASTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. WITH THESE REMNANTS 
REMAINING UPSTREAM OF THE REGION THROUGH FRIDAY...WILL PLAN TO BE A 
LITTLE MORE PESSIMISTIC WITH CLOUD COVER THAN THE MODELS. GFS MODEL 
INDICATES SOME LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS OVER SOUTHEAST TN ON THURSDAY... 
BUT WITH A VERY DRY BOUNDARY LAYER OBSERVED ON THE SOUNDINGS...WILL 
HANDLE THIS BY ONLY MENTIONING MORE CLOUDS WITHOUT ANY PRECIP. GFS 
AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE THAT MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF HERMINE 
WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...ALTHOUGH THE NAM 
MODEL REMAINS FAIRLY DRY THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. FOR NOW...WILL PLAN 
TO CONTINUE WITH SMALL CHANCE POPS AREAWIDE FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY 
NIGHT...AS ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY WITH 
THE APPROACH OF A WARM FRONT. MODELS INDICATE A FAIRLY STABLE AIR 
MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...SO WILL 
MENTION ONLY SHOWERS. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD...AND LOOK REASONABLE. THE 
ONLY EXCEPTION BEING TONIGHT...WHERE THE WARMER NAM NUMBERS APPEAR 
BETTER DUE TO THE SLOW SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF THE COLD FRONT.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODEL PROGS SHOW UPPER 
TROF SHIFTING EAST FROM THE PLAINS STATES ON SATURDAY TO THE 
ATLANTIC COAST BY SUNDAY NIGHT. INITIALLY...A WARM FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WILL BE PULLED NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY. 
MAINTAINED A MEDIUM CHANCE POP FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS FORMING AHEAD OF THIS BOUNDARY. THE COLD FRONT ARRIVES 
LATER SATURDAY NIGHT AND MODEL DEPICTION APPEARED TO MOVE THE COLD 
FRONT THROUGH MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 12Z SUNDAY. TO BLEND WITH 
ADJACENT WFO'S USED A SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POP EARLY IN THE DAY 
DROPPING MENTION OF RAIN DURING THE AFTERNOON AS THE FRONT AND 
ASSOCIATED MOISTURE AXIS WILL BE WELL SOUTH AND EAST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. KEPT THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST DRY WITH A NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW CONTINUING THROUGH MID WEEK. MODELS TRY TO BRING A WEAK COLD 
FRONT TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY WEDNESDAY BUT THE FEATURE 
APPEARS RATHER WEAK WITH LIMITED ACCOMPANYING MOISTURE 
CONVERGENCE/LIFT. THEREFORE STAYED WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR NOW 
AWAITING BETTER MODEL RESOLUTION IN THE COMING DAYS.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM NEAR 
WASHINGTON DC SOUTHWEST ALONG THE APPALACHIANS TO NEAR CROSSVILLE 
AND MEMPHIS. AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED SHOWERS AND A FEW TSTORMS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA ALONG THIS COLD FRONT...WITH HIGH DEWPOINTS 
IN THE MID TO UPPER 60S. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY MOVE 
SOUTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...AND BE COMPLETELY 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY SUNSET AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. 

WITH ALL OF THIS MIND...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS

.AVIATION...COLD FRONT JUST TO NORTHWEST OF AREA IN SOUTHERN KY 
MOVING SLOWLY SOUTHEAST TOWARD EAST TN. PRE FRONTAL TROF ACTING AS 
FOCUS FOR SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS OVER TYS AND TRI. HUMIDITY HIGH 
ENOUGH FOR HEAVY RAIN IN SHOWERS. PATCHY CHARACTER OF SHOWERS WILL 
MEAN OPENINGS IN CIGS AND RESPITES FROM RAINS. BASICALLY WHEN IT 
DOES RAIN, IT WILL POUR. OCCASIONAL POSITIVE LIGHTNING STRIKES WILL 
BE POWERFUL AND BE ASSOCIATED WITH HEAVIER RAINS. 

WINDS WILL BE GENERALLY FROM WEST TO NORTHWEST AT LESS THAN 10 
KNOTS, BUT WILL VARY IN DIRECTION AND GUST TO POSSIBLY LOW 20S IN 
VICINITY OF THUNDERSTORMS/SHOWERS. 

EXPECT MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS EXCEPT IN HEAVY SHOWERS, WHEN 
CONDITIONS WILL DROP TO MVFR. DO NOT EXPECT LIFR CONDITIONS, BUT 
WILL MONITOR. CONFIDENCE IN THIS IS NOT THAT HIGH CONSIDERING HEAVY 
NATURE OF RAINS SO FAR THIS MORNING.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK FRONT WILL ENTER THE AREA 
TODAY AND MOVE OUT OF THE AREA OVER NIGHT.  ATMOSPHERE IS SLOWLY 
MOISTENING UP AGAIN IN ADVANCE OF IT. THE BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION 
SHOULD OCCUR THIS AFTERNOON IN PROXIMITY, PARTLY FIRED BY AFTERNOON 
WARMTH.  TOTAL QPF VALUES WILL BE ON THE LOWISH SIDE. EVEN THOUGH 
THE MODELS ARE INCREASING THE POPS, THEY APPEAR TO BE INCREASING 
THEM TOO RAPIDLY, WITH SOME LIKELIES. HAVE THEREFORE KEPT THEM IN 
THE CHANCE RANGE. WITH THE CLOUD COVER AND SCATTERED RAIN SHOWERS 
TODAY...LEANED TOWARD THE BLEND TEMPERATURES FOR BOTH PERIODS. 
DEWPOINTS WILL HAVE REBOUNDED OVER THE LAST FEW DRY DAYS AND SO THE 
MUGGINESS OF LATE SUMMER IS BACK.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS TRENDING DRIER NOW 
FOR FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...WITH THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT STILL 
DRY BEHIND THE FRONTAL PASSAGE. LATEST ECMWF STILL GENERATING SOME 
SIGNIFICANT MESOSCALE CONVECTION THAT WOULD AFFECT OUR AREA BY 
FRIDAY NIGHT...BUT THE AMOUNT OF PRECIPITATION (PCPN) LOOKS SUSPECT 
TO ME UNDER THE BUILDING UPPER RIDGE AT THAT TIME. THUS...I TRIMMED 
POPS BACK FOR FRIDAY...BUT KEPT CONTINUITY FOR FRIDAY NIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY WITH SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR ALL OF THOSE PERIODS. 
NO CHANGES FOR MONDAY OR TUESDAY FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS...AS SURFACE 
HIGH BUILDS OVER THE REGION. 

OTHERWISE...MADE A FEW SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS TO MAX/MIN TEMP GRIDS... 
ESPECIALLY ON FRIDAY WHEN POPS WERE LOWERED...AND ALSO FOR THURSDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A WEAK FRONT APPROACHING THE 
AREA LATE TONIGHT. A FEW RADAR ECHOES DEVELOPING IN WEST TN/KY 
CURRENTLY AHEAD OF IT. BUT WITH THE DRY ATMOSPHERE AHEAD OF 
IT...THINK THE BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER 
MIDNIGHT TONIGHT AND INTO WEDNESDAY. GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR 
TEMPERATURES TONIGHT LOOK REASONABLE SO STAYED CLOSE. WITH THE EXTRA 
CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION ON WEDNESDAY...LEANED TOWARD THE BLEND 
TEMPERATURES FOR WEDNESDAY. 

.LONG TERM...MODEL AGREEMENT AND CONSISTENCY IS NOT TOO BAD FOR
THE MOST PART...SO UNCERTAINTY LEVEL IS ABOUT AVERAGE FOR THE LONG
TERM PERIOD. NAM DOES PUSH WEAK COLD FRONT FURTHER SOUTH THAN
GFS...AND SOME UNCERTAINTY ABOUT IF IT EVER MAKES IT SOUTH OF OUR
AREA. HOWEVER...APPEARS DEEPER MOISTURE AND WEAK LIFT SHOULD
EXIT...SO WILL GO DRY WED NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT FOR NOW. HOW
FAR NORTH THE REMNANTS OF HERMINE GO BEFORE ROUNDING THE RIDGE AND
DROPPING SOUTHEAST STILL PROBLEMATIC...BUT LOOKING MORE LIKELY THAT
AT LEAST NORTHERN PARTS OF THE AREA BE AFFECTED IN THE
FRIDAY/FRIDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. UNSETTLED WEATHER WILL CONTINUE
INTO THE WEEKEND AS FRONTAL SYSTEM AFFECTS THE AREA. LOOKS LIKE
FRONT WILL EXIT THE AREA BY SUNDAY NIGHT...SO WILL GO DRY MONDAY
AND TUESDAY.

NOT REALLY SOLD ON ANY SIGNIFICANT RAINS LATE TONIGHT...AND I DID

NOT THAT IMPRESSIVE IN MODELS, A LITTLE SPOTTY, BUT IT'S A

NOT LOOK LIKE A BIG PRECIP PRODUCER...BUT STILL WARRANTS SLIGHT 
CHANCE LATE TUE NIGHT AND CHANCE POPS ALL BUT FAR NORTH ZONES WED.  
UNCERTAINTY HIGHER FOR LATER PERIODS.  WILL GO DRY FOR NOW THU AND 
THU NIGHT...BUT MAY BE SOME PRECIP LINGERING ESPECIALLY SOUTHERN 
ZONES CLOSER TO THE FRONT.  MODEL HANDLING OF MAIN MOISTURE 
ASSOCIATED WITH REMNANTS OF HERMINE ALSO A CONCERN.  FOR NOW LOOKS 
LIKE THIS WILL MOVE BY TO OUR WEST AND NORTH...BUT ENOUGH OF A 
MOISTURE INCREASE INDICATED FOR OUR AREA TO COMBINE WITH THE FRONT 
TO OUR SOUTH MOVING BACK NORTH AND THEN ANOTHER COLD FRONT MOVING IN 
FROM NORTHWEST TO GO WITH CHANCE POPS FOR THE WEEKEND.  FRONT SHOULD 
BE SOUTH OF THE AREA BY MONDAY...ALLOWING FOR A DRY DAY...BUT GIVEN 
SPREAD IN MODEL SOLUTIONS UNCERTAINTY VERY HIGH BY DAY 7.  GFS MOS 
TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST SOME TWEAKS.

ON TRACK...NO CHANGES NEEDED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A VERY NICE LABOR DAY AHEAD FOR 
THE REGION WITH PLEASANT MORNING TEMPS IN THE 40S TO MID/UPR 50S.
UPPER RIDGE SPREADING EAST OVER THE AREA TODAY...WHILE SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE IS MOVING EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. THIS WILL ALLOW 
FOR A WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW TO DEVELOP (ESPECIALLY FOR OUR 
PLATEAU COUNTIES)...WHICH SHOULD ALLOW MAX TEMPS TO CLIMB INTO 
MOSTLY THE 70S TO MID OR UPPER 80S...AS MAX SUNSHINE IS ALSO 
EXPECTED. 

GENERALLY CLEAR SKIES TONIGHT WITH MILDER MIN TEMPS...PROBABLY A BIT 
CLOSER TO THE COOLER GFS MOS NUMBERS. THESE MINS WILL BE COOLER THAN 
CLIMO...BUT NOT ANYWHERE NEAR RECORD LOWS FOR SEP 7TH. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...RIDGING ALOFT CONTINUES
TUESDAY WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES. TUESDAY NIGHT MOISTURE
INCREASES FROM THE MS VALLEY INTO THE TN VALLEY AS COLD FRONT
APPROACHES. CLOUDS WILL SLOWLY INCREASE. LOWS WILL BE MUCH WARMER
IN THE 60S. WEDNESDAY COLD FRONT PASSES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA.
MOST OF THE DEEPER MOISTURE STAYS TO THE WEST. WEDNESDAY NIGHT
SHOULD BE DRY WITH FRONT SOUTH. THURSDAY FRONT MOVES BACK TOWARD
THE FORECAST AREA AS A WARM FRONT. WARMER AND MOIST AIR MASS WILL
STAY OVER THE AREA THROUGH SUNDAY WITH RAIN CHANCES CONTINUING. THE
BEST CHANCE SATURDAY AS NEW COLD FRONT APPROACHES. TEMPERATURES
SLIGHTLY COOLER THURSDAY BUT WILL STAY ABOVE NORMAL THROUGH THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...PERSISTENCE WAY TO GO WITH STRONG 
HIGH PRESSURE IN PLACE OVER THE CAROLINAS.  WILL SEE ANOTHER QUIET 
WEATHER DAY WITH ABUNDANT SUNSHINE AND WARM AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES.  
HIGHS SHOULD REACH THE UPPER 80S AND INTO THE 90S ACROSS THE TN

UPPER 50S TO MID 60S.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN FAIRLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD...LEADING TO HIGHER THAN AVERAGE 
CONFIDENCE.  LOOKS LIKE FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH FRIDAY/EARLY FRIDAY 
NIGHT TIME PERIOD.  INSTABILITY/MOISTURE/FORCING LOOK LIMITED...SO 
DOES NOT LOOK LIKE IT WILL BE MUCH OF A PRECIP PRODUCER.  WILL CARRY 
LOW CHANCE POPS FRIDAY/SLIGHT CHANCE EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT.  COOLER AIR

WEDNESDAY. THIS AFTERNOON TEMPERATURES FAIRLY UNIFORM IN THE MID
80S TO NEAR 90 AND ONLY CLOUDS ARE SCATTERED CUMULUS ON THE PLATEAU
AND A FEW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND SOUTHERN VALLEY. DRY AIR
MASS WILL ALLOW FOR LARGE DIURNAL SWING WITH NIGHTTIME LOWS AS LOW

WEDNESDAY WITH FULL SUN AND DRY AIR MASS SO NO DEVIATIONS.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED

WARM CONDITIONS THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT. A FAIRLY STRONG COLD FRONT

RETURN TO MORE SEASONAL TEMPS FOR THE WEEKEND. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS 
AGREE THAT MOISTURE WILL BE FAIRLY LIMITED WITH THIS FRONT...SO WILL 
CONTINUE WITH A MENTION OF ONLY SMALL CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY AND 
FRIDAY NIGHT. A LARGE DOME OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL THEN SETTLE ACROSS 
THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION...WITH A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL HIGH 
BUILDING FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS PATTERN

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE AND SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE WILL DOMINATE OUR WEATHER FOR THE SHORT TERM. EXPECT DRY
CONDITIONS WITH AN OVERALL DECREASE IN CLOUDS. MAV TEMPS LOOK
REASONABLE OVERALL..SO JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST IS 
STEADY STATE. ONLY MADE A FEW MINOR ADJUSTMENTS AS MASSIVE RIDGE 
REMAINS IN POSITION WITH AXIS EXTENDING FROM THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC 
STATES THROUGH THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THROUGH THURSDAY. HOWEVER...THE 
RIDGE WILL BE WEAKENING BY THURSDAY AS AN UPPER TROF SWINGS EAST 
FROM THE NORTH CENTRAL STATES THROUGH MUCH OF THE GREAT LAKES REGION 
BY FRIDAY NIGHT. A WEAK AND MOISTURE STARVED COLD FRONT WILL 
ACCOMPANY THE TROF'S PASSAGE FRIDAY INTO EARLY FRIDAY NIGHT. TWEAKED 
THE POPS UP TO LOW CHANCE ON FRIDAY FOR THE FROPA. MODELS ALLOW FOR 
A DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW BEHIND THE DEPARTED SYSTEM FOR THE WEEKEND. 
HIGH TEMPERATURES WILL BE A GOOD 8 TO 10 DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL UNDER 
THE INFLUENCE OF THE RIDGE TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY AS NEARLY 
MAXIMUM INSOLATION OCCURS WITHIN A DRY ATMOSPHERIC COLUMN. ONCE 
AGAIN ADJUSTMENTS HAD TO BE MADE TO MEX MOS MIN TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE 
AS IT APPEARS THE MODELS MAY BE LOWERING DEWPOINT TEMPS JUST A BIT 
TOO MUCH...MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. 
ALSO...MODELS DON'T SEEM TO BE ACCOUNTING FOR THE TREMENDOUS AMOUNT 
OF HEAT ENERGY THE SURFACE HAS ENDURED DURING THIS VERY WARM LATE 
SUMMER SEASON. BELIEVE THERE WILL BE A FAIR AMOUNT OF RE-RADIATED 
ENERGY DURING THIS HEAT WAVE WHICH SHOULD SLOW THE DROP IN 
TEMPERATURES EVEN IN THE DRIER ENVIRONMENT. ALSO HAD TO ADJUST MAX 
TEMPS UP A BIT OVER THE WEEKEND AS MOS SEEMS TO BE ERRONEOUSLY 
PULLING THE GUIDANCE NUMBERS DOWN DUE TO CLIMATOLOGY.

.DISCUSSION...NO UPDATES PLANNED THIS EVENING. RADAR ECHOES OVER 
AREA NOT INDICATING ANY PRECIPITATION REACHING THE GROUND. HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING INTO THE AREA SHOULD PROVIDE A DRY FORECAST FOR 
THE REST OF TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON 
TRACK...NO CHANGES NEEDED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...A BAND OF SHOWERS...ASSOCIATED WITH LOW PRESSURE OVER
THE LOWER MS REGION...HAS STAYED TO OUR SOUTHWEST. OVER THE NEXT
24 HOURS...THE TREND WILL BE FOR HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MID
ATLANTIC AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TO RETROGRADE AND STRENGTHEN
SLIGHTLY...WHICH WILL PUSH THE RAIN BAND FARTHER AWAY AND INCREASE
SUBSIDENCE. THE BUILDING RIDGE WILL ALSO RESULT IN WARMER MIDLEVEL
TEMPS TOMORROW...WHICH WILL SUPPRESS CONVECTION. SO THE FIRST TWO
PERIODS OF THE FORECAST LOOK DRY. MOS GUIDANCE HAS CONSISTENTLY
BEEN TOO COOL WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS...SO WENT ABOVE GUIDANCE TONIGHT.
LESS CLOUD COVER TOMORROW SHOULD RESULT IN WARMER HIGH
TEMPS...ESPECIALLY SOUTH...WITH MOST SPOTS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS IN
THE UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
NOT MUCH CHANGE IN FORECAST WITH MID ATLANTIC UPPER RIDGE IN PLACE 
AND STRENGTHENING MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY. ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY WITH MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES. THE 
NEXT CHANCE OF RAIN COMES FRIDAY. ECMWF AND GFS BRING WEAK COOL 
FRONT THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY WITH VERY LIMITED 
MOISTURE. GFS SLOWER SO KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE MOST AREAS FRIDAY NIGHT. 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH NW FLOW BEHIND FRONT. STILL

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL TRACK NORTH ALONG THE MS VALLEY...WHILE
HIGH PRESSURE REMAINS FIRMLY ENTRENCHED OVER THE MID ATLANTIC
REGION. DEEP MOISTURE AND PRECIP/LOW CEILINGS ASSOCIATED WITH THE
LOW WILL REMAIN TO THE WEST OF THE TAF SITES. THE ONLY IMPACT WILL
BE SOUTHEAST WINDS AT OR ABOVE 10 KT AT CHA...WTIH BROKEN MIDLEVEL
CLOUDS. TYS AND TRI ARE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A SOUTHEASTERLY
DOWNSLOPE FLOW...WHICH WILL PREVENT ANY PRECIP OR LOW CEILINGS.
HOWEVER AS WE HAVE SEEN THE PAST SEVERAL MORNINGS...VISIBILITIES
MAY BE REDUCED TO MVFR OR 6SM DUE TO LIGHT FOG OR HAZE AT TYS AND

.DISCUSSION...
EAST TN WILL BE IN A TRANSITION ZONE FROM A VERY MOIST AIR MASS AND
LOW PRESSURE TO THE SOUTHWEST TO A DRY AIR MASS AND HIGH PRESSURE TO
THE NORTHEAST. 12Z RAOBS SHOW WELL OVER 2 INCH PW AT BMX...TO 1
INCH AT RNK. A DEEP SOUTHEAST FLOW FROM THE SURFACE TO 500 MB
SHOULD MEAN THAT THE PRECIP OVER AL SHOULD STAY JUST OUTSIDE OUR
BORDERS...BUT SOME CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT COULD OCCUR THIS
AFTERNOON...SO WILL KEEP THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING. SATELLITE
TRENDS AND FORECAST MOISTURE PROFILES SHOW THAT SIGNIFICANT MID TO
UPPER LEVEL CLOUDS WILL AFFECT THE SOUTHERN HALF OF OUR AREA. FOR
THIS REASON TEMPERATURES WILL NEED TO BE LOWERED A FEW
DEGREES...INTO THE MID/UPPER 80S. THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS
WILL BE UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF A DOWNSLOPE FLOW...AND CLOUD COVER
WILL HAVE LESS IMPACT THERE...SO WILL KEEP THE CURRENT FORECAST
HIGHS AROUND 90 GOING FOR TYS AND TRI.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
CENTERED TO OUR EAST AND NORTHEAST.  WEAK LOW NEAR GULF COAST WILL 
DRIFT NORTH NEAR MISSISSIPPI RIVER.  SOUTHEAST FLOW WILL BRING SOME 
INCREASE IN MOISTURE AND CLOUDS...ESPECIALLY TO SOUTHERN AREAS...BUT 
APPEARS BULK OF PRECIP WILL STAY TO OUR SOUTH AND WEST.  WILL KEEP 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SOUTH TODAY AND FAR SOUTHWEST ZONES EARLY 
TONIGHT.  WILL GENERALLY STAY CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS FOR HIGHS 
TODAY...WITH A NUDGE UP MOST LOCATIONS FOR MINS TONIGHT.    

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE WITH THE IDEA 
OF THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES UPPER RIDGE HOLDING ITS POSITION AND 
STRENGTH THROUGH MID WEEK. STAYED WITH THE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR 
CONVECTION ON THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU ON MONDAY AS THE RIVER OF 
TROPICAL MOISTURE BETWEEN THE EXPANDING HIGH AND LOWER PRESSURE OVER 
THE CENTER OF THE NATION WILL CONTINUE TO FLOW NORTHWEST ACROSS THE 
HIGHER PLATEAU TERRAIN. SOME LIFT WILL STILL BE PRESENT WITH 
WEAKENING AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE DEEP SOUTH...ALONG WITH SOME 
INSTABILITY AND OROGRAPHICS. BEYOND THIS RATHER LIMITED CHANCE FOR 
RAIN. THE NEXT CHANCE THAT THE FORECAST AREA MAY SEE A COOLING 
SHOWER WOULD BE FRIDAY. SOME DIFFERENCES IN MODEL TIMING OF 
WEAKENING UPPER LEVEL TROF MIGRATING ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES TOWARD 
THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY WITH THE ECMWF FASTER 
THAN THE GFS HOWEVER...BOTH MODELS APPEARED TO SLOW DOWN THE ARRIVAL 
OF THIS FEATURE FROM EARLIER MODEL DEPICTION SO JUST PLACED THE 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP ON FRIDAY. A LITTLE TOO DISTANT TO HAVE A GREAT 
DEAL OF CERTAINTY WITH THIS SYSTEM BUT IT DOES APPEAR TO BE RATHER 
ANEMIC WITH UPPER TROF BUILDING EAST INTO MASSIVE UPPER RIDGE. COOL 
FRONT LOOKS LIKE IT MAY HAVE VERY LIMITED MOISTURE TO WORK WITH AS 
IT MOVES INTO A REGION WHICH WILL BE AFFECTED BY AN EXTENDED PERIOD 
OF DRIER EASTERLY DOWNSLOPING FLOW. ALSO THE PRESSURE PATTERN AHEAD 
OF THE FRONT REVEALS ONLY WEAK CONVERGENCE WITH ITS PASSAGE. STAYED 
WITH A DRY FORECAST ON SATURDAY AS NORTHWESTERLY FLOW PUSHES 
BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. MONDAY NIGHT MET/MAV TEMPS A 
FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES TO COOL AND HAD TO ADJUST HIGHER. ALSO MEX 
MOS MINS LOOK SEVERAL DEGREES TO COOL ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE 
EXTENDED.

OCCURRED YESTERDAY. THE RUC AND NAM BOTH SHOW SHOWERS MOVING INTO
THE VALLEY. SO WILL EXPAND THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP INTO THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY COUNTIES THIS AFTERNOON FOR THE MORNING UPDATE. DOWNSLOPE
FLOW SHOULD PREVENT ACTIVITY FROM MOVING INTO THE CENTRAL VALLEY.

332 AM EDT SAT AUG 28 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...NOT MUCH CHANGE TO THE PATTERN 
FOR THE SHORT TERM...WITH UPPER RIDGE OVER THE REGION AND SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED TO OUR NORTHEAST.  WITH SOUTHEAST LOW LEVEL 
FLOW THERE MAY BE ISOLATED CONVECTION AGAIN OVER THE FAR SOUTHEAST 
AND SMOKY MOUNTAINS...BUT DOWNSLOPE FLOW INTO THE VALLEY SHOULD 
INHIBIT MUCH CONVECTION MAKING IT WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS.  WILL GO 
WITH A MAINLY PERSISTENCE FORECAST.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE SO NO SIGNIFICANT ADJUSTMENTS PLANNED.  

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A NICE AND WARM PERIOD IN STORE 
AS AN UPPER RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES AND THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. HAD TO MAINTAIN SOME SMALL AND 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY AS A WEAK LOW SHIFTS NORTH FROM THE 
NORTHERN GULF COAST INTO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. THE SOUTHERLY 
FLOW BETWEEN THE BUILDING RIDGE AND LOWER PRESSURE AREA WILL ALLOW 
FOR THE ADVECTION OF TROPICAL MOISTURE ACROSS MUCH OF THE DEEP 
SOUTH. THE SOUTHERN AND WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE 
ON THE EASTERN PERIPHERY OF THIS MOIST PLUME EARLY IN THE WEEK 
BEFORE BEING SHUNTED FARTHER AND FARTHER WEST AS THE THE RIDGE 
STRENGTHENS. SUBSIDENCE AND DRYING WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER SCENE 
TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY ALLOWING FOR NEARLY UNABATED INSOLATION 
AND A MINI HEAT WAVE. BY THURSDAY NIGHT AN UPPER TROF WILL HAVE 
MIGRATED EAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES AND MIDWEST. AN ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT MAY MAKE IT INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE THURSDAY NIGHT WITH 
PROGRESSION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION DURING THE DAY 
FRIDAY SO HELD ONTO THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR FRONTAL CONVECTION AT 
THIS TIME. MEX MOS GUIDANCE LOOKED A LITTLE TOO COOL THROUGH MOST OF 
THE PERIOD SO TWEAKED TEMPS UPWARD A DEGREE OR TWO.

A WEAK FRONT...OR REALLY JUST A DEWPOINT GRADIENT...IS LOCATED FROM

SOUNDINGS DO SHOW SOME INSTABILITY AS YESTERDAY'S MIDLEVEL CAP IS
WEAKER TODAY...ESPECIALLY TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST. THE
RUC...NAM...AND CANADIAN ALL PRODUCE SOME LIGHT QPF IN SW VA AND SW

LARGE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION SHOULD 
SUPPRESS ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF NEXT 
WEEK...AND ALSO ALLOW TEMPS TO GRADUALLY RISE EACH DAY. LATEST GFS 
MODEL RUN INDICATES THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME TROPICAL MOISTURE 
SURGING NORTHWARD ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK (WHICH

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY TODAY WILL TRACK 
TOWARD THE AREA TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. THE FRONT IS DISTINGUISHED 
MAINLY BY A DROP IN DEWPOINTS AND BY THE BACK EDGE OF SOME CLOUDS IN 
SATELLITE. RADARS SHOW NO PRECIP CURRENTLY ASSOCIATED WITH THIS 
FRONT AS MOISTURE IS SHALLOW...MAINLY BELOW 850 MB...AND THE 
MIDLEVEL FLOW IS NORTHWEST. SO AS THE FRONT APPROACHES TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW...NOT MUCH PRECIP IS EXPECTED. THE MODELS DO PRODUCE SOME 
LIGHT QPF IN SW VA AND IN SW NC TOMORROW AFTERNOON...AND THE 
MIDLEVEL INVERSION NOTED IN RAOBS THIS MORNING IS WEAKER 
TOMORROW...ESPECIALLY NORTH AND EAST. WILL INCLUDE A MENTION OF 
ISOLATED SHOWERS AND TSTMS IN THESE AREAS...IN LINE WITH SURROUNDING 
OFFICES. TEMPS SHOULD BE SIMILAR TO TODAY...WITH LOWS IN THE 60S AND 
HIGHS IN THE 80S IN MOST SPOTS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...AND 
REVEAL A TRANQUIL PATTERN THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. SURFACE HIGH 
PRESSURE MOVES EAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY AND BECOMES STATIONARY 
OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. A LARGE UPPER-LEVEL HIGH IS PROGGED 
TO DEVELOP OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION FOR THE WEEKEND AND 
INTO NEXT WEEK...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO SUPPRESS ANY CONVECTIVE 
DEVELOPMENT AND ALLOW DAYTIME TEMPS TO GRADUALLY RISE EACH DAY. 
FOLLOWED GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

WOULD STAY WITH THE PREVIOUS FORECAST FOR THIS FRONTAL PASSAGE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH AND CAROLINAS...WITH A SLIGHTLY DRIER 
AIR MASS (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) OVER THE FORECAST AREA. HIGH 
PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...BRINGING MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND 
LIGHT WINDS. AS FOR TEMPS...MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SOME CHANGES COMING AS UPPER 
LOW OVER NORTHEAST US OPENS UP AND DRIFTS AWAY FROM REGION...PUSHED 
BY UPPER TROF OVER HUDSON BAY. THIS WILL ALLOW A WEAK COLD FRONT TO 
PASS THROUGH THE AREA LATE WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...TEMPS WILL ONLY COOL 
TO MORE NEAR NORMAL VALUES FOR LATE SUMMER AND THE ATMOSPHERE WILL 
STILL BE QUITE DRY FOR PREDICTING ANY REAL RAINFALL. HAVE LEFT POPS 
MUCH AS THEY WERE AND GONE WITH PREVIOUS THINKING THAT THEY MAY END 
UP BEING REMOVED ALTOGETHER IN SUBSEQUENT FORECASTS. EVEN THE PW'S 
RETURN TO MORE NORMAL LEVELS...SO BELIEVE THAT IF A THUNDERSTORM 
DOES OCCUR IT WILL ONLY PRODUCED LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL...AND NOT 
LOCALLY VERY VERY HEAVY RAINFALL. BY THURSDAY...THE LOW MOVES OUT 
AND THE WESTERN US RIDGE MOVES QUICKLY EAST TO ASSERT ITSELF QUITE 
STRONGLY OVER THE EAST THROUGH THE WEEKEND. IT ALMOST TAKES ON QUASI 
OMEGA BLOCK CHARACTERISTICS AND SO THIS WILL BEAR WATCHING LATER. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS ARE QUITE DRY AS WELL...HINTING AT SOME MIDDLE TO 
HIGH CLOUDS WITH FROPA BUT THAT'S ABOUT IT. KEPT TEMPS AS IS...SEE 
NO REASON TO CHANGE THEM.

ARE THE RULE THIS AFTERNOON...AS MOISTURE LINGERS IN THE SURFACE TO
850 MB LAYER. KEPT NRN AND CENTRAL AREAS PARTLY CLOUDY OVERNIGHT...
WHILE SRN VALLEY SHOULD CLEAR OUT THIS EVENING. THE BOUNDARY LAYER
WILL BE QUITE MOIST...SO ADDED SOME AREAS OF FOG FOR MOST AREAS.
MOS MINS QUITE CLOSE AND HARD TO DIFFER WITH...AS DEW POINT TEMPS
HAVE BEEN FALLING SLOWLY. 

SURFACE HIGH AND UPPER RIDGE TO DOMINATE...ALTHO NERN STATES UPPER
LOW DOES SETTLE SOUTH TO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY MONDAY NIGHT.
PAINTED IN A FEW MORE CLOUDS FOR OUR FAR NE AREAS FROM THIS FEATURE 
BUT PREFER NOT TO ADD SLIGHT CHANCE POPS JUST YET FOR TUESDAY
AFTERNOON. 

OTHERWISE...DRIER AIR BRINGS SEASONAL MINS WITH HIGHS RUNNING A FEW
DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL...WITH GFS MOS SLIGHTLY PREFERRED.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...FINALLY THE EXTENDED 
WEATHER PATTERN FEATURES QUITE A BIT OF CHANGE IN TEMPERATURE AND 
DEWPOINT TEMPERATURE WITH A NORTHERLY UPPER LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPING 
THROUGH MOST OF THE PERIOD AS AN UPPER LOW DEVELOPS OVER THE 
NORTHEASTERN AND MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES WITH ANOTHERN LONG WAVE TROF 
DROPPING BACK INTO THIS AREA THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. THIS FEATURE WILL 
BE PRECEDED BY A COLD FRONT THAT MOVES THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. 
ADJUSTED THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM TO THIS 
PERIOD WITH FROPA BUT THIS MAY NEED TO BE REMOVED IF THE PASSAGE  
APPEARS LIKE IT WILL OCCUR IN A MOISTURE STARVED ENVIRONMENT. WENT 
AHEAD AND KEPT AND EXTENDED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SOUTHWEST NORTH 
CAROLINA AND THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA ON FRIDAY. 
EXPANDED THE SLIGHT CHANCE TO THE SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU REGION 
FOR SATURDAY AS MOISTURE DEEPENS WITH INCREASING SOUTHEASTERLY 
UPSLOPE FLOW AROUND THE BASE OF THE PERSISTANT NORTHEASTERN U.S. 
SURFACE RIDGE. USED A NICE DRY SUNDAY AS AN UPPER LEVEL RIDGE MAKES 
PROGRESS INTO THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY. ADJUSTED MAX AND 
MINS A LITTLE BELOW MOS GUIDANCE AS REFRESHING SLIGHTLY BELOW TO 
NEAR NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE IN STORE THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED

REVEAL SOME LINGERING INSTABILITY...BUT I HESITATE TO CARRY ABY 
AFTERNOON POPS (OR EVENING) AT THIS TIME. THE LATEST WATER VAPOR 
SATELLITE PICS SHOW SOME VERY DRY AIR SPREADING QUICKLY SE THIS

THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND CENTRAL VALLEY THIS EVENING AND THE
SOUTHERN PLATEAU FROM MIDDLE TN AS THE UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE DUE TO
HEATING AND ABUNDANT TROPICAL MOISTURE WERE AVAILABLE FOR
CONVECTION TO FIRE. SOME STORMS BECAME STRONG BUT HEAVY RAINFALL
WAS THE MAIN CONCERN ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE SATURATED NORTHERN
PLATEAU. ACTIVITY HAS BEGUN TO WEAKEN BUT MORE STORMS ACROSS MIDDLE
TN AND SE KY SHOULD CONTINUE A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND ISOLATED
THUNDERSTORMS THROUGHOUT THE NIGHT. LOWERED TEMPERATURES A FEW

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...CONVECTION CONTINUES TO 
DEVELOP WELL AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT AND SHORTWAVE TROUGH THIS 
AFTERNOON. SURFACE BOUNDARY FOCUSING MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY APPEARS 
TO AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY OR PERHAPS A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AXIS. MADE 
LAST MINUTE ADJUSTMENTS TO INCREASE POPS FOR REST OF THE PRE-00Z 
FORECAST GRIDS...AS THIS LINE OF CONVECTION SWEEPS EAST FROM THE 
PLATEAU COUNTIES TO THE ERN MTNS. UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT FOR THIS 
CONVECTION SEEMS TO BE THE RIGHT REAR QUADRANT OF A MID TO UPPER 
LEVEL JET AXIS TO OUR NORTH. 

AFTER THIS ACTIVITY...LOWERED POPS FOR THE EARLY EVENING HOURS AND 
THEN INCREASED POPS IN LINE WITH SHORT RANGE MODELS AND LATEST POPS. 
AIRMASS IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT IS QUITE UNSTABLE OVER THE WRN 
2/3RDS OF TN INTO NRN PARTS OF MS AND AL...SO CAN'T ARGUE WITH SHORT 
RANGE MODELS DEVELOPING MORE SHOWERS AND TSRA OVERNIGHT. GUSTY WINDS 
AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS APPEAR TO BE THE MAIN THREAT. 

OTHERWISE...MAIN CHANGES FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT WERE TO LOWER 
POPS MUCH QUICKER ON SUNDAY...AND ACTUALLY DROP NEARLY ALL POPS BY 
SUNDAY EVENING. NORTHERLY FLOW BEHIND THIS SYSTEM BRINGS CLEARING 
AND DRIER AIR FOR MONDAY. HOWEVER...NAM MOS HIGHS LOOKED TOO COOL 
FOR MONDAY...AND I TRENDED CLOSER TO A BLEND WITH THE WARMER GFS 
MOS. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...LATER MODEL RUNS HAVE 
COME INTO BETTER AGREEMENT ON SHIFTING MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES UPPER 
LOW JUST A BIT FARTHER EAST ALLOWING FOR A NICE DRY TUESDAY. DECIDED 
TO HANG ONTO THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR POSSIBLE CONVECTION WITH A 
FROPA ON WEDNESDAY. HOWEVER...THIS EVENT STILL LOOKS VERY 
QUESTIONABLE IN TERMS OF HAVING SUFFICIENT MOISTURE FOR RAIN. WILL 
WAIT UNTIL THE NEXT COUPLE OF MODEL RUNS. A NORTHERLY FLOW AND 
HIGHER SURFACE PRESSURE LEADS TO DRY AND TEMPERATE WEATHER FOR MUCH 
OF THE REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST. ALTHOUGH I DID ADD A 
SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA 
BORDER AND THE SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU FOR SATURDAY AS MODELS 
SHOW A MOISTENING SOUTHERLY RETURN FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE 
MIDDLE ALANTIC SURFACE RIDGE. ONCE AGAIN...UNDERCUT THE WARMER MEX 
MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS ACROSS THE BOARD AS MILDER AIR FILTERS INTO THE 
REGION.

.DISCUSSION...QUITE AN AIRMASS CHANGE FROM YESTERDAY MORNING WITH A 
WARM FRONT MOST LIKELY LOCATED BETWEEN TYS (DEWPT 74) AND TRI (DEWPT 
65). THE WEAK CIRCULATION (TROPICAL) TO OUR SOUTH YESTERDAY SEEMS TO 
HAVE PUSHED THE WARM FRONT INTO OUR REGION...WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER 
(PW) BACK UP TO JUST OVER 2 INCHES AT OHX PER 12Z SOUNDING. 12Z RNK 
SOUNDING STILL QUITE DRY IN THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS AND PW NOT 
QUITE 1 INCH. MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING FOR HIGHS NEAR 90 WOULD 
YIELD INSTABILITY OF 1300 J/KG AND LIFTED INDEX OF -3 DEGS C.

RADARS ALREADY FAIRLY ACTIVE AS SCATTERED SHOWERS AND TSRA OVER NRN 
GA MOVE NORTH INTO SW NC...WITH WIDESPREAD CONVECTION AHEAD OF THE 
MS VALLEY COLD FRONT MOVING ESE INTO CENTRAL KY AND NW PARTS OF 
MIDDLE TN. THIS ACTIVITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT LOOKS TO WEAKEN...BUT 
COULD LEAVE AN OUTFLOW BOUNDARY NEAR OUR NW AREAS TO POTENTIALLY 
HELP FOCUS CONVECTION LATER TODAY OR EARLY TONIGHT. 

PREDICTING CONVECTIVE COVERAGE IS CHALLENGING...SO PLAN TO LEAVE 
POPS AT HIGH CHANCE FOR SW TO LESSER CHANCE IN THE NE...WITH 
SCATTERED WORDING FOR COVERAGE. 

MOS MISSED MIN TEMPS THIS MORNING BY SEVERAL DEGREES (TOO COOL) AND 
THE TROPICAL LIKE MOISTURE DOES NOT FAVOR A LOT OF 90 DEGREE PLUS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT OVER CENTRAL EAST TN... 
WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S ACROSS SOUTHWEST VA AND 
NORTHEAST TN AND A TROPICAL AIR MASS SOUTH OF THE BOUNDARY WITH 
DEWPOINTS IN THE LOWER TO MID 70S OVER SOUTHEAST TN. THIS WARM FRONT 
IS PROGGED TO CONTINUE SLOWLY MOVING NORTHEAST TODAY...WITH A VERY 
MOIST TROPICAL AIR MASS SPREADING ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. 
IN FACT...MODELS INDICATE THAT PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES WILL RISE 
TO BETWEEN 2 AND 2.25 INCHES BY THIS EVENING...WHICH SHOULD RESULT 
IN SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL WITH SOME OF THE SCATTERED CONVECTION 
EXPECTED TODAY AND TONIGHT. A COLD FRONT OVER THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY IS PROGGED TO MOVE INTO THE OHIO AND TN RIVER VALLEYS BY THIS 
EVENING...WITH CONVECTION BECOMING LIKELY AROUND THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU BY LATE TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS 
THE NAM GUIDANCE (WITH COOLER MAXES AND WARMER MINS)...SINCE IT HAS 
BEEN VERIFYING BETTER LATELY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...FORECAST MODELS ARE IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT IN PUSHING FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLOWLY SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH LIKELY TSRA POPS AREA 
WIDE ON SUNDAY WITH BOUNDARY PUSHING THROUGH AND PWAT VALUES AT OR 
ABOVE TWO INCHES ON 12Z SUNDAY ALONG WITH SLIGHT TO MODERATE 
INSTABILITY EXPECTED ALONG BOUNDARY. FRONT IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
SOUTHEAST WITH TIME...WITH GFS/ECMWF/NAM MODELS PUSHING FRONT 
SOUTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO GEORGIA/NORTH ALABAMA BY 06Z 
MONDAY. 

CURRENT TRENDING BY FORECAST MODELS ARE FOR LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TO
PUSH SOUTHEAST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 12Z MONDAY...SO HAVE DROPPED
MENTION OF SHRA/TSRA SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY ACROSS THE AREA.
ECMWF MODEL IS STILL INDICATING THAT THERE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT LOW
LEVEL MOISTURE/LIFT/INSTABILITY ALONG NEXT COLD FRONT TO KEEP IN A
SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR WEDNESDAY...HOWEVER...INDICATIONS ARE THAT
THIS SHOULD BE A SMALL LINE OF SHRA/TSRA ALONG BOUNDARY AS IT MOVES
THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION BY WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON. 

ECMWF/GFS MODELS DEVELOP A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ACROSS NORTH 
GEORGIA BY 12Z FRIDAY...WITH MODELS DEPICTING MEASURABLE PRECIP 
ACROSS MY SOUTHEAST COUNTIES AND FAR EASTERN COUNTIES AND INTO 
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. HAVE ADDED IN A SLIGHT CHANCE POP TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THIS FEATURE. 

TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE TO ONE TO TWO CATEGORIES BELOW GFS GUIDANCE
AND WILL KEEP TEMP FORECAST GENERALLY ALONG SAME TRACK WITH THIS
THINKING IN MIND.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...EFFECTS OF DRIER AIR
MAINLY NOTED OVER SW VA AND NE TN THIS AFTERNOON...WHERE DEWPOINT
TEMPS HAVE FALLEN INTO THE UPPER 50S TO MID 60S. ELSEWHERE...
DEWPOINT TEMPS MOSTLY IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S AND SOME
CUMULUS CLOUDS HAVE DEVELOPED AS TEMPS HAVE REACHED THE 80S TO
LOWER 90S. SURFACE MAPS SHOWING SOME WEAK MOISTURE CONVERGENCE
ACROSS TN/NC MTNS AND ALSO TO OUR SOUTH ALONG THE WEAK FRONTAL
BOUNDARY. WEAK CIRCULATION ON SATELLITE PICS OVER CENTRAL AL IS
LIKELY AIDING WHAT CONVECTION IS ONGOING TO OUR SOUTH THIS
AFTERNOON. THESE TSRA APPEAR TO BE MOVING SLOWLY NORTH TOWARD SE TN
AND SW NC.

KEPT THE LOW POPS OVER SRN AND WRN AREAS OVERNIGHT...AND LOWERED
MIN TEMP FORECAST JUST A BIT FROM PREVIOUS GRID...ALTHOUGH 61
DEGREES LOOKED TOO LOW FOR TRI (MOS WAS 6 DEGREES TOO COOL THERE
LAST NIGHT). PATCHY AREAS OF FOG MAY DEVELOP AGAIN TONIGHT...BUT
MAINLY WHERE LEAST CLOUD COVER IS EXPECTED (SW VA AND NE TN).

OTHERWISE...SHORT RANGE MODELS SIMILAR AND THE TREND CLEARLY WAS TO
DECREASE RAIN CHANCES ON SATURDAY AND EVEN A SLOWER ONSET OF
PRECIPITATION WITH THE NEXT SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND COLD FRONT. 
SLOWED DOWN THE LIKELY POPS UNTIL FAR W-NW AREAS LATE SATURDAY
NIGHT...THEN LOW END OF LIKELY POPS FOR SUNDAY.  


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...NORTHEASTERN U.S. UPPER 
TROF WILL CONTINUE TO AMPLIFY OVER THE REGION SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY DRIVING COLD FRONT SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE APPALACHIAN 
MOUNTAINS. HELD ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS ON MONDAY FOR 
PART OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH 
CAROLINA AS MODELS SLOW DOWN UPPER TROF SIGNIFICANTLY AND FORM A 
CLOSED LOW OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS EARLY IN THE PERIOD. WILL 
HAVE TO LOOK AT THIS CLOSER OVER THE NEXT COUPLE DAYS TO SEE IF THIS 
SYSTEM MAY HAVE MORE OF AN IMPACT ON THE FORECAST AREA IN TERMS OF 
CONTINUED CHANCE FOR RAIN IN THIS AREA AS WEAK SHORT WAVE FEATURES 
ROTATE SOUTHEAST AROUND THE SYSTEM'S PRESSURE CENTER. FOR NOW KEPT 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY NIGHT DRY BUT DID MAINTAIN A SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR A SHOWER OR THUNDERSTORM ON WEDNESDAY AS A MOISTURE STARVED 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. DRIER NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW BUILDS IN FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE WORK WEEK WITH SURFACE 
RIDGING SO KEPT PRECIP OUT OF THE FINAL TWO DAYS OF THE EXTENDED. 
CONCERNING TEMPS...MEX MOS LOOKED A BIT TOO WARM AND ADJUSTED THE

ACTION GOING LATE TONIGHT INTO SATURDAY AROUND THE REMNANT LOW OVER
DIXIE AND SUFFICIENT AMOUNT OF MOISTURE IN THE STAGNANT TROPICAL

THE FORECAST AREA BEHIND THIS BOUNDARY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS 
CLEAR SKIES OVER THE REGION WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE FOG DEVELOPMENT 
THIS MORNING...BUT DRIER AIR AND LIGHT NORTHEAST WINDS IN THE GREAT

AND NORTHEAST TN. FOR NOW...WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE DENSE FOG 
ADVISORY ISSUED EARLIER...BUT MAY BE ABLE TO CANCEL IT EARLY FOR 
SOUTHEAST TN AND CENTRAL EAST TN IF FOG DOES NOT DEVELOP IN THE NEXT 
FEW HOURS. MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT SOME CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND CENTRAL EAST 
TN...WHERE A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS SHOULD DEVELOP CLOSE TO 
THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THUS...WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS ACROSS 
THESE AREAS FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS INTO TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...MOS

AND LOOKS REASONABLE. HOWEVER...WILL TREND WARMER THAN GUIDANCE WITH

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MOISTURE WILL AGAIN BE ON 
THE INCREASE BY SATURDAY FROM WEST TENNESSEE...AS A SHORT WAVE IS 
PROGGED BY THE MODELS TO PUSH THROUGH THE REGION. LATEST GFS MODEL 
RUN TRIES TO HOLD BACK SHRA/TSRA WITH NEXT FRONTAL BOUNDARY AS IT IS 
SHOWN TO DEVELOP SHRA/TSRA INTO EAST TENNESSEE BY 12Z SUNDAY. 

HAVE INCREASED PRECIP CHANCES SLIGHTLY TO AROUND 50 PERCENT FOR A 
PORTION OF SUNDAY MORNING FOR THE AREA DUE TO A LITTLE BETTER MODEL 
CONSISTENCY. UPPER TROF IS THEN PROGGED TO MOVE SOUTHEAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS BY LATE SUNDAY/EARLY MONDAY TIME FRAME. ECMWF MODEL IS 
A LITTLE SLOWER WITH RESPECTS TO FRONTAL MOVEMENT SOUTHEAST INTO THE

339 PM EDT THU AUG 19 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...BUSY SHIFT THIS
AFTERNOON AS SHOWERS/TSRA HAVE LINGERED OVER NE TN AND SW VA
...ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. MAINLY HYDROLOGY CONCERNS WITH SOME
FLOODING OCCURRING AGAIN IN SCOTT COUNTY VA...SEE LATEST LSRMRX
PRODUCT FOR DETAILS. A COUPLE OF FLOOD ADVISORIES AND ONE FFW STILL
IN EFFECT FOR SW VA AND NE TN. ORGANIZED CONVECTION WILL END BEFORE
6PM EDT...SO I OPTED FOR A PRE FIRST PERIOD IN ZONE FORECAST.

CLINCH RIVER NEAR SPEERS FERRY IN SCOTT COUNTY VA IS ON THE RISE
THIS AFTERNOON AND BEING CLOSELY MONITORED. PLEASE SEE OUR LATEST
FLSMRX PRODUCT FOR THE LATEST CREST FORECAST (STILL BELOW FLOOD
STAGE OF 18.0 FEET).

OTHERWISE...TIME IS SHORT...SO WILL JUST SAY THAT REST OF FORECAST
PERIODS FOR THE SHORT TERM WERE JUST SLIGHTLY TWEAKED...AND
GENERALLY WERE ON TRACK. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...NO MAJOR DIFFERENCES 
IN MODELS DURING THE PERIOD BUT STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO ECMWF 
DEPICTION. SOME UNCERTAINTY IN SYSTEM/FRONTAL TIMING FOR SATURDAY 
NIGHT BUT MODELS ARE INDICATING A WEAK SHORT WAVE FEATURE BUILDING 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AROUND SATURDAY/SATURDAY NIGHT 
TIMEFRAME SO MAINTAINED A 50 PERCENT POP FOR THE FORECAST AREA AT 
THIS TIME. MAIN UPPER TROF WILL BE PROGRESSING EAST ACROSS THE GREAT 
LAKES AND MIDWEST SUNDAY INTO MONDAY DRIVING A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
THROUGH THE REGION. KEPT PROBABILITY AT 40 PERCENT ON SUNDAY FOR 
CONVECTIVE PRECIP WHILE DROPPING BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE SUNDAY NIGHT 
AS BOUNDARY SLIPS FURTHER SOUTH AND EAST. BOUNDARY STARTS TO SLOW 
DOWN AND MAY BECOME STATIONARY OVER NORTHERN GEORGIA ON MONDAY SO 
STAYED WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA ON MONDAY WHILE 
OPTING FOR A NICE DRY FORECAST REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST AREA. WAS 
ABLE TO KEEP TUESDAY DRY WITH HIGHER PRESSURE BUILDING IN BEHIND 
THIS EARLY WEEK SYSTEM. UNCERTAINTY INCREASES LATE IN THE LONG TERM 
FORECAST BUT MODELS WOULD LIKE TO BRING YET ANOTHER UPPER TROF 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER WITH ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT AT MID WEEK. 
USED THE SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION WITH THIS FRONT 
WHILE DRYING IT OUT AGAIN ON THURSDAY WITH EXPECTATION OF FRONTAL 
PASSAGE FOLLOWED BY LOWER DEWPOINT AND HIGHER PRESSURE.

SIGNIFICANT CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION (PCPN) IS OVER EXTREME NE TN

A CHECK OF RAINFALL AMOUNTS OVERNIGHT SHOWED THE HEAVIEST RAINS JUST 
TO OUR WEST IN FENTRESS AND PUTNAM COUNTIES FOR EXAMPLE...WHERE A 
COCORAHS COOKEVILLE SITE REPORTED 7.75 INCHES OF RAIN IN PAST 24

INCHES AT PETROS...WITH DOPPLER RADAR ESTIMATES IN EXCESS OF 3 
INCHES NOTED FROM NORTHERN SCOTT CO. TN NORTH INTO SE KY.  

ELSEWHERE...AMOUNTS DROPPED BELOW 2 INCHES...ALTHO I DID MEASURE 
2.25 INCHES AT MY GAGE IN JEFFERSON COUNTY. MOST AREAS AROUND AN 
INCH OR LESS...WITH EXTREMELY LIGHT RAINS OVER SE TN AND SW NC 
GENERALLY BELOW 1/10 INCH. 

WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING FOR REST OF TODAY...SINCE UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH AXIS IS TO OUR WEST...AND THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPEARS 
TO BE LOCATED ACROSS OUR SRN MOST AREAS THIS MORNING. MODIFIED 12Z 
OHX SOUNDING (WITH AN INCH LESS OF PRECIPITABLE WATER FROM 12Z WED)

COUNTIES IN ANTICIPATION OF HEAVY RAINFALL BY LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING
THAT COULD CAUSE FLASH FLOODING PROBLEMS IF CURRENT TRENDING OF
EXPECTED PRECIP FORMATION AND TRAINING OCCURS OVER TRI CITIES/SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AREAS. PWAT VALUES ARE PROGGED BY MODELS TO INCREASE TO
BETWEEN 2.3 TO 2.8 INCHES ACROSS THE CWA AND MAY NEED TO WATCH

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...DIFFUSE SURFACE BOUNDARY 
WHICH HAS PROVIDED A FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR ORGANIZED PRECIP MAINLY 
OVER SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE TODAY IS PROJECTED TO DRIFT SLOWLY 
NORTHWARD TAKING BULK OF PRECIP WITH IT. THUS ANTICIPATE BEST 
COVERAGE IN THE NORTHERN TIER OVERNIGHT AND HAVE KEPT LIKELY POPS 
GOING FOR THAT AREA. UPPER SHORT WAVE TROUGH APPROACHES THE AREA ON 
WEDNESDAY PROVIDING VERY MOIST SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW ALONG WITH 
MODERATE INSTABILITY. CONTINUED LIKELY POPS AREA-WIDE FOR TOMORROW. 
TEMPS WILL AGAIN BE DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP COVERAGE. 
UNDERCUT MAV GUIDANCE FOR TOMORROW SLIGHTLY IN ANTICIPATION OF 
RELATIVELY GOOD PRECIP COVERAGE.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THE MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT ABOUT THE GENERAL PATTERN FOR WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY...HOWEVER THERE REMAINS A GREAT DEAL OF 
VARIANCE IN THE DETAILS. THE GENERAL TREND IS FOR THE TROPICAL GULF 
COAST LOW TO DRIFT TOWARD THE NORTH AND MERGE INTO A PASSING 
MID-LATITUDE SHORTWAVE TROUGH. THE SPEED AND INTENSITY OF THE 
TROPICAL LOW WILL BE THE KEY TO THE AMOUNT OF PRECIP ACROSS EAST TN. 
UNFORTUNATELY THE MODELS DIFFER WIDELY...WITH THE CANADIAN 
BEING FASTEST AND STRONGEST AND THE NAM BEING WEAKEST. THE GFS SEEMS 
TO BE A REASONABLE COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO AND WILL GENERALLY BE 
FOLLOWED...BUT CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

DEEP GULF MOISTURE WILL CONTINUE TO FEED INTO THE AREA WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT AS THE TROPICAL LOW DRIFTS NORTH. UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE 
RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER JET WILL ENHANCE LIFT. THE GFS 
AND CANADIAN MODELS SHOW AN AREA OF STRONG 850 MB MOISTURE 
CONVERGENCE AT THE NOSE OF A 20-25 KT LLJ OVER THE AREA LATE 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT/EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. IF THIS FEATURE DOES 
DEVELOP...SOME SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL TOTALS WILL BE POSSIBLE. WILL 
HAVE LIKELY POPS WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY MORNING. THE UPPER 
TROUGH AXIS SHOULD BE EAST OF THE AREA BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...SO 
POPS WILL DROP BACK TO A CHANCE. 

WHILE MODEL RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY HAS BEEN POOR...THE TREND OF THE 
MORE RECENT RUNS HAS BEEN TOWARD A BUILDING RIDGE OVER THE AREA ON 
FRIDAY...WITH DEEP MOISTURE BEING SUPPRESSED TO OUR SOUTH. WILL 
LOWER POPS FRIDAY BUT WILL STILL KEEP A LOW CHANCE POP SOUTH/SLIGHT 
CHANCE NORTH DUE TO LOW CONFIDENCE. THE RIDGE GIVES WAY QUICKLY TO A 
TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE NORTHWEST...WHICH SHOULD BRING 
INCREASING CHANCES OF SHOWERS ON SATURDAY. THE GFS SHOWS A CLOSED 
LOW DROPPING SOUTH ALONG THE EAST COAST FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. 
CONFIDENCE IN THIS SOLUTION IS LOW...SO WILL NOT MAKE ANY 
SIGNIFICANT CHANCES TO THE LAST THREE DAYS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...DIFFUSE BOUNDARY CURRENTLY 
MOVING THROUGH THE EAST TENNESSEE AREA IS FOCUSING SCATTERED 
CONVECTION ALONG IT. MODELS/SREF IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
BOUNDARY WILL STALL OUT NEAR THE SPINE OF THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS 
BEFORE RETURNING NORTH BY LATE TOMORROW. THIS WILL AGAIN SERVE AS A 
FOCUSING MECHANISM FOR CONVECTION TOMORROW AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY IN 
OUR SOUTHEASTERN ZONES. PRECIPITATBLE WATER VALUES ACCOMPANYING THIS 
BOUNDARY APPROACH 2.5 INCHES PER NAM FORECAST SOUNDINGS. HAVE BUMPED 
UP POPS TO LIKELY IN THE SOUTHEASTERN ZONES WHILE MAINTAINING CHANCE 
POPS ELSEWHERE. TEMPS HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON CLOUD COVER AND DEGREE OF 
PRECIP COVERAGE...BUT GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV 
GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A LINGERING BOUNDARY ALONG WITH A GOOD FLOW OF TROPICAL MOISTURE 
WILL MEAN A WET PERIOD TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. LIKELY POPS 
WILL BE FORECAST TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT IN 
ASSOCIATION WITH THE SLOW NORTHWARD DRIFT OF THE TROPICAL LOW OVER 
THE GULF COAST AND THE EASTWARD PROGRESSION OF A MID-LATITUDE UPPER 
TROUGH. THERE WILL BE A POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN THESE PERIODS GIVEN 
THE DEEP FEED OF GULF MOISTURE AND THE PRESENCE OF A SURFACE 
BOUNDARY. DAYTIME TEMPS SHOULD ALSO BE CLOSER TO NORMAL WITH BROKEN 
TO OVERCAST CLOUD COVER.

THE MODELS HAVE HAD A DIFFICULT TIME GETTING A HANDLE ON THE 
MOVEMENT OF THE TROPICAL LOW NEAR THE GULF COAST. RUN-TO-RUN 
CONSISTENCY HAS BEEN POOR...AND THE ENSEMBLE SPREAD FOR THE WEEKEND 
IS QUITE LARGE. THUS CONFIDENCE IN THE WEEKEND FORECAST IS LOW. THE 
GFS AND THE CANADIAN DO HAVE SOME SIMILARITIES TO EACH 
OTHER...SHOWING THE NORTHWARD-DRIFTING TROPICAL LOW BEING PICKED UP 
BY THE MID-LATITUDE SHORTWAVE AND MOVING AWAY FROM THE AREA ON 
FRIDAY...BUT THE 12Z CANADIAN IS MUCH FASTER. THE ECMWF IS 
COMPLETELY DIFFERENT...SHOWING A WESTWARD DRIFT OF THE LOW AND A 
LARGE RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE SOUTHEAST. GIVEN THESE 
UNCERTAINTIES...WILL NOT MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...KEEPING POPS IN THE LOW CHANCE/SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE FOR 
NOW. SUNDAY AND MONDAY LOOK TO BE DRY WITH THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS 
ALONG THE ATLANTIC COAST AND A RIDGE BUILDING IN FROM THE WEST.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...SLOW MOVING WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY MAY MANAGE TO MAKE IT INTO OUR AREA MONDAY...BUT NO 
SIGNIFICANT COOLING OR DRYING ON TAP. FORCING FOR CONVECTION ALSO 
WEAK WITH THE FRONT. AIRMASS WILL REMAIN RATHER STAGNANT FOR THE

ZONES.  WILL GENERALLY KEEP NEAR MAV TEMPS...BUT WILL GENERALLY 
TWEAK MAV MIN TEMPS UP SLIGHTLY...AND SOME MAX TEMPS DOWN 
SLIGHTLY.   

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MODELS DETERIORATE FROM 
DECENT AGREEMENT EARLY IN THE LONG TERM TO A CONTINUATION OF UTTER 
DISAGREEMENT BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM...ALONG WITH A CONTINUATION OF 
POOR RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY. SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BECOMES 
SITUATED BETWEEN WESTERN PERIPHERY OF UPPER RIDGE OFF THE ATLANTIC 
COAST AND AN APPROACHING UPPER TROUGH FROM THE WEST. THIS WILL 
RESULT IN AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE IN RESULTING SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW. 
THUS HAVE CONTINUED WITH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY. AFTER THIS...PROFOUND DIFFERENCES START TO APPEAR. THE 
BIGGEST SOURCE OF MODEL/ENSEMBLE UNCERTAINTY CONTINUES TO BE THE 
TRACK AND TIMING OF RESIDUAL MOISTURE FROM NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO 
TROPICAL FEATURE. THE GFS AND SEVERAL GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS 
EVENTUALLY BRING MOISTURE INTO THE AREA...BUT THE TIMING DIFFERS BY 
SEVERAL PERIODS. ECMWF MODEL SHOWS TROPICAL MOISTURE GETTING CAUGHT 
UP INTO ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE BOUNDARY THAT APPROACHES THE 
AREA. A SLIGHT MAJORITY OF MODELS/ENSEMBLE MEMBERS BRING BULK OF 
MOISTURE THROUGH ON SATURDAY. THUS HAVE BUMPED UP POPS SLIGHTLY FOR 
THAT TIME FRAME. OTHERWISE...DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO 
PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST DUE TO HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY.

HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE. HEAT INDEX VALUES IN EXCESS

WOULD BE THE NICE LINE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ASSOCIATED

BEING FELT AT TRI CLOSER TO THE STRONGER LIFT WITH SHORT WAVE. SOME
UNCERTAINTY ABOUT THIS FEATURE SO JUST USED A VICINITY SHRA AT THIS

RADIATIVE FLUX ENOUGH TO KEEP MUCH FOG FROM DEVELOPING DESPITE
TROPICAL DEWPOINTS. STAYING WITH THE BIG LINE THEME...OUTFLOW

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
VERY LITTLE CHANGE IN THE OVERALL PATTERN SHOULD RESULT IN TODAY
BEING SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY. MODELS INDICATE A SHORTWAVE TROUGH
MOVING ACROSS NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...WITH THE GREATEST
INSTABILITY AND WEAKEST CAPPING IN THAT AREA AS WELL. GREATER CIN
WILL HAVE TO BE OVERCOME IN THE SOUTHERN HALF. WILL HAVE HIGH
CHANCE POPS NORTH AND A SLIGHT CHANCE POP SOUTH...ABOVE MOS
GUIDANCE. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE PAST FEW NIGHTS...CONVECTION
SHOULD PERSIST WELL PAST SUNSET DUE TO LINGERING OUTFLOW
BOUNDARIES...AND WILL CARRY CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POPS INTO
TONIGHT.

THE GFS MOS TEMPS HAVE BEEN RUNNING A BIT WARM THE PAST FEW
DAYS...AND WILL GO BELOW THEM BY A FEW DEGREES...BUT THE SOUTHERN
VALLEY SHOULD STILL REACH THE UPPER 90S. DEWPOINTS HAVE BEEN
DROPPING WITH DAYTIME MIXING THE PAST FEW DAYS...BUT THIS MAY NOT
HAPPEN QUITE AS MUCH TODAY DUE TO THE NOCTURNAL PRECIP THAT HAS
PERSISTED. THE HEAT INDEX SHOULD EXCEED 105 FOR A FEW HOURS...AND
THE HEAT ADVISORY AREA WILL BE MAINTAINED. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
BOUNDARY LINGERING ACROSS THE AREA BRINGING SCATTERED
THUNDERSTORMS TO THE REGION ON FRIDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST
CHANCES FOR THE UPSLOPE AREAS. A FRONT ENTERS THE AREA BY THE
WEEKEND AS A TROPICAL SYSTEM PROVIDES A INCREASE IN MOISTURE. WILL
KEEP HIGH CHANCE POPS FOR BOTH SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. THE FRONT
LINGERS INTO THE FIRST PART OF NEXT WEEK...SO WILL CONTINUE CHANCE
POPS FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. UPPER NORMAL TEMPERATURES WILL
CONTINUE THROUGH THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR HPC/MEX GUIDANCE FOR
TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...NOT MUCH CHANGE IN THE 
PATTERN FOR THE SHORT TERM...SO WENT WITH A MOSTLY PERSISTENCE 
FORECAST.  WILL CONTINUE TO CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL 
VALLEY...WITH CHANCE POPS HIGHER TERRAIN AS WELL AS ACROSS THE NORTH 
WHERE SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MAY ENHANCE CHANCES A BIT.  DEW 
POINTS HAVE BEEN DIPPING ENOUGH IN THE AFTERNOON TO KEEP HEAT INDEX 
VALUES FROM GETTING AS HIGH AS MIGHT BE EXPECTED GIVEN THE HIGH 
TEMPS. VALUES FOR TOMORROW MAY BE BORDERLINE IN THE ADVISORY 
AREA...BUT WILL KEEP HEAT ADVISORY GOING AS IS.  WILL GENERALLY GO 
CLOSE TO MAV TEMPS...BUT WILL RAISE SOME MIN TEMPS TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER RIDGE STILL 
PROMINENT IN THE FORECAST THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY WITH ONLY SLIGHT 
RAIN CHANCES OVERALL WITH A LITTLE BETTER COVERAGE FRIDAY IN THE 
MOUNTAINS. CONTINUED HOT TREND WITH DAYTIME HIGHS AND OVERNIGHT LOWS 
SEVERAL DEGREES ABOVE NORMAL. MOISTURE MOVING NORTH FROM THE GULF 
FROM TROPICAL SYSTEM WILL LIKELY NOT INCREASE SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM CHANCES UNTIL LATE FRIDAY AND MORE LIKELY OVER THE 
WEEKEND. HEAT INDEX VALUES LIKELY TO BE IN THE 100 TO 105 RANGE 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY FOR THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN VALLEY SECTIONS. A 
COLD FRONT WILL DROP SE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY BY LATE IN THE WEEKEND 
AND THIS FEATURE WILL COMBINE WITH THE MOISTURE FROM THE TROPICAL 
SYSTEM OVER THE MS VALLEY AND SOUTHEAST FOR GREATER CHANCES OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AT LEAST INTO TUESDAY AND POSSIBLY 
WEDNESDAY. HIGHS WILL BE SLIGHTLY COOLER WITH HEAT INDEX VALUES 
TOPPING OUT NEAR 100.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THE FORECAST TODAY SHOULD BE 
SIMILAR TO TUESDAY'S WEATHER WITH ANTICYCLONIC FLOW PERSISTING IN 
RELATIVELY MOIST AIRMASS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY AND OROGRAPHIC LIFTING TO ALLOW FOR SLIGHT 
AND LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION TODAY. A WEAK SHORT WAVE 
MAY ASSIST CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION SHOULD PERSIST INTO THE 
EVENING ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. NO RELIEF IN THE HEAT WAVE 
TODAY WITH MIDDLE AND UPPER 90 DEGREE TEMPERATURES FOR THE GREAT 
VALLEY. HIGH HUMIDITY CONTINUES WITH ANOTHER VERY WARM NIGHT TONIGHT 
ACROSS MUCH OF SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE SO THE HEAT ADVISORY WILL REMAIN 
IN EFFECT FOR THIS AREA.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...THE DOMINANT UPPER RIDGE 
BECOMES ELONGATED EAST TO WEST ACROSS MS/AL/GA ON 
THURSDAY...ALLOWING A WEAK TROUGH TO MOVE INTO THE AREA FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. THIS SHOULD BRING SLIGHTLY BETTER PRECIP CHANCES...MAINLY 
TO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE THE PAST FEW 
NIGHTS...ISOLATED CONVECTION SHOULD PERSIST INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. 
ADDITIONAL CLOUD COVER SHOULD KEEP HIGH TEMPS BELOW THE TRIPLE 
DIGITS OF THE GFS MOS AT CHA...BUT UPPER 90S AND LITTLE DROP IN 
AFTERNOON DEWPOINTS WILL MEAN HEAT INDEX VALUES AROUND 105 ON 
THURSDAY. WILL KEEP THE HEAT ADVISORY IN PLACE. 

A SHORTWAVE RIDGE BUILDS BACK OVER THE AREA FOR FRIDAY...WHICH MAY 
CONFINE SHOWER ACTIVITY TO MAINLY THE HIGHER TERRAIN. HIGHS WILL 
ONCE AGAIN REACH THE UPPER 90S IN SOUTHERN LOCATIONS. GREATER 
MOISTURE FROM THE REMNANTS OF TD5 COMBINED WITH THE WEAKENING AND 
RETROGRADING OF THE RIDGE WILL MEAN GREATER PRECIP CHANCES AND 
SLIGHTLY LOWER TEMPS FOR THE WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. A MIDLEVEL 
DEFORMATION ZONE THAT SETS UP OVER THE AREA ON SUNDAY AND MONDAY 
SHOULD PROVIDE A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS BOTH DAYS.

.DISCUSSION...MINOR UPDATE TO DROP POPS OVERNIGHT. ISOLATED 
CONVECTION SHOULD STAY BELOW 20%. WARM TEMPS CONTINUE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE WILL BEGIN 
TO MIGRATE SLIGHTLY WESTWARD DURING THE SHORT TERM.  HOWEVER ...IT 
WILL REMAIN THE MAIN INFLUENCE OVER AREA WEATHER.  EVENING 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE ISOLATED AND SHOULD FAVOR HIGHER TERRAIN.  
CONVECTION SHOULD END AROUND SUNSET...THOUGH COULD SEE ISOLATED 
DEVELOPMENT TOWARDS MORNING AS A WEAK IMPULSE SLIDES THROUGH.  
CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP AGAIN OVER THE AREA WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.  
COVERAGE SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY INCREASED AS A WEAK SHORT WAVE ENHANCES 
DEVELOPMENT.  WILL SEE TEMPERATURES ONCE AGAIN CLIMB INTO THE MID TO 
UPPER 90S ACROSS THE TN VALLEY.  HEAT INDICES WILL BE AROUND 105 
DEGREES IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY WITH OVERNIGHT LOWS AT OR ABOVE 75 
DEGREES.  THEREFORE...A HEAT ADVISORY WILL BE IN EFFECT BEGINNING 
WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON.

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE CONVERGING 
ON PUSHING UPPER RIDGE SOUTHWEST INTO THE UPCOMING WEEKEND. THIS 
SHOULD ALLOW FOR A WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO SHIFT SOUTHEAST TOWARD 
AND INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY 00Z FRIDAY. UNTIL THE BOUNDARY MAKES 
IT INTO THE AREA ON THURSDAY...EXPECT ANOTHER HOT DAY AND CONTINUING 
HEAT ADVISORY FOR THE SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE COUNTIES AROUND 
CHATTANOOGA FOR THURSDAY AFTERNOON UNTIL 00Z FRIDAY.  AS THE UPPER 
TROUGH AMPLIFIES BY THE END OF THE WORK WEEK...NORTHWEST FLOW WILL 
AGAIN SET UP ACROSS THE AREA...RESULTING IN SLIGHTLY INCREASED POPS 
FOR THE FORECAST AREA. HAVE UPPED POPS INTO THE 40 PERCENT RANGE FOR 
FRIDAY TO ACCOUNT FOR SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND THE BOUNDARY 
INTERACTION.

THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BE SLOWLY DROPPING SOUTH ACROSS THE
AREA AND FURTHER WEAKENING ON SATURDAY...AND WILL STILL CONTINUE
WITH CHANCE POPS FOR THE AREA. SECONDARY AND STRONGER FRONT WILL
SYNOPTICALLY PUSH SOUTHEAST WITH TIME BY SUNDAY INTO THE FORECAST
AREA AND HAVE UPPED POPS SLIGHTLY INTO THE 40 PERCENT CATEGORY AT
THIS TIME TO ACCOUNT ALSO FOR BUILDING OF LONG WAVE TROUGH BACK
INTO THE EAST-SOUTHEAST PART OF THE U.S. 

EXPECT UPPER TROUGH TO PUSH EASTWARD THROUGH THE AREA BY SUNDAY
AFTERNOON...AND THROUGH AREA BY MONDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH BASIC
FORECAST THINKING OF REDUCING POPS FOR MONDAY TO SLIGHT CATEGORY
IN THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE AREA. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR
TYS-SOUTHWARD TO ACCOUNT FOR EXPECTED SURFACE FRONTAL POSITION BY
AFTERNOON/EVENING ON MONDAY. 

WILL STAY A LITTLE COOLER THAN GFS GUIDANCE TOWARD LATER PERIODS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL REMAIN NEARLY STATIONARY OVER THE
LOWER OHIO VALLEY/MID MS VALLEY THROUGH MUCH OF THIS PERIOD. THUS
EXPECT THAT A PERSISTENCE FORECAST WILL BE THE WAY TO GO. EXPECT
ISOLATED AFTERNOON AND EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TODAY
THROUGH WEDNESDAY...WITH THE TERRAIN AREAS BEING FAVORED. THE
RIDGE DOES BREAK DOWN A LITTLE ON THURSDAY...ALLOWING A WEAK
SHORTWAVE TROUGH TO PASS BY ON THURSDAY. THIS SHOULD BRING SOME
BETTER PRECIP CHANCES...ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN SECTIONS.

TEMPERATURES TODAY WILL REACH THE UPPER 90S ACROSS MUCH OF THE
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN TN VALLEY TODAY AND WEDNESDAY. WITH AFTERNOON
DEWPOINTS AROUND 70...HEAT INDEX VALUES IN THIS AREA WILL TOP OUT
BETWEEN 100 AND 105 TODAY...JUST BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA. MODELS
INDICATE SLIGHTLY HIGHER DEWPOINTS TOMORROW...WHICH MAY GIVE HEAT
INDICIES JUST ABOVE 105. GREATER CLOUD COVER ON THURSDAY SHOULD
HOLD TEMPS BACK A LITTLE ON THURSDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE MID 90S.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER RIDGING CONTINUES TO
FADE INTO THE WEEKEND AS WESTERN ATLANTIC UPPER TROF AMPLIFIES.
RESULTING NORTHWESTERLY UPPER FLOW WILL BRING A WEAK SHORT WAVE
FEATURE INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. SYNOPTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY
WILL BE SLOWLY DROPPING SOUTH ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN
MOUNTAINS AS THE UPPER TROF STRENGTHENS. THEREFORE APPLIED MEDIUM
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. WITH PROTECTIVE RIDGE OUT OF
THE PICTURE AND GRADUAL APPROACH OF A LONG WAVE TROF BUILDING BACK
INTO THE EASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE
SUFFICIENTLY UNSTABLE FOR WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION SO USED 30
PERCENT POPS FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. THE UPPER TROF CONTINUES EAST
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AND MODELS LIKE THE IDEA OF ANOTHER COOL
FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACCOMPANYING THIS FEATURE INTO THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY SO STAYED WITH 30 PERCENT POPS FOR THIS POSSIBILITY DROPPING
BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE DURING THE DAY MONDAY ACROSS THE NORTHERN
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AS FRONT MAY BE ABLE TO MOVE THROUGH MUCH
OF THE REGION BY AFTERNOON OR EVENING.

OVER HIGHER TERRAIN AND POSSIBLY OVER FAR SOUTHERN LOCATIONS.  IT

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...INITIAL PERSISTENT 
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST CONTINUES TO SHOW SIGNS OF 
WEAKENING BY THURSDAY. WEAK INITIAL FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS PROGGED BY 
GFS/ECMWF MODELS TO MAKE IT TO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA BY 00Z FRIDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH AT LEAST 30 PERCENT POPS TO 
CONTEND WITH EXPECTED SCATTERED AFTERNON SHRA/TSRA DEVELOPMENT 
ESPECIALLY FROM TYS-NORTHWARD. 

MODELS ARE CONSISTENT IN DEPICTING THAT BOUNDARY SHOULD CONTINUE TO
WEAKEN/DISSIPATE ACROSS THE AREA BY SATURDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH AT
LEAST SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THROUGH SUNDAY. NEXT FRONT IS DEPICTED BY
MODELS TO SLOWLY PUSH THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY AND
TIMING OF THIS BOUNDARY MOVING THROUGH THE AREA WILL LIKELY DEPEND
UPON WHETHER WE WILL LATER BE INCREASING PRECIP CHANCES FOR MONDAY
AFTERNOON. AT THIS TIME...WILL CONTINUE WITH GOING PRECIP CHANCES...
DUE TO UNCERTAINTY OF TIMING. 

WILL CONTINUE WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH UPCOMING WEEKEND
AND WITH INCREASED CLOUDS/MOISTURE BY EARLY NEXT WEEK...TEMPS MAY 
SLOWLY WORK THEIR WAY BACK DOWN TOWARD CLIMO.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A COLD FRONT IS CURRENTLY PUSHING SOUTHWARD ACROSS THE AREA. BASED 
ON SURFACE DEWPOINTS...IT APPEARS THAT THE FRONT IS SOUTH OF BNA AND 
CSV...BUT NORTH OF TYS. MODELS INDICATE DEWPOINTS FALLING INTO THE 
UPPER 50S TO LOWER 60S THROUGH THE DAY AS THE FRONT MOVES SOUTHWARD. 
SOUTHERN SECTIONS WHERE DEWPOINTS ARE CURRENTLY IN THE LOWER TO MID 
70S WILL SEE SOME PATCHY FOG THIS MORNING...BUT THIS SHOULD ERODE 
QUICKLY WITH MIXING. A SURFACE HIGH OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND A DRY 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL PROVIDE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES TODAY AND 
TONIGHT...WITH HIGHS GENERALLY IN THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S. LOW 
TEMPS SHOULD BE PLEASANT TONIGHT WITH THE LOWER DEWPOINTS...REACHING 
THE LOWER TO MID 60S IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM  SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS REGION 
PROVING A MOSTLY DRY FORECAST FOR SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. MAY SEE A 
FEW THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOPING ACROSS MAINLY THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH A VERY MOIST AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS REVEALED A LINE OF CONVECTION ALONG THIS FRONT...WITH 
SOME SCATTERED PRE-FRONTAL ACTIVITY FURTHER SOUTH OVER SOUTHEAST KY. 
SHORT-RANGE MODELS AGREE THAT A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL 
AMPLIFY OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION TODAY AND TONIGHT... 
PUSHING THIS WEAK COLD FRONT INTO THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS EVENING. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL INCREASING MID LEVEL WINDS AND COOLING MID 
LEVEL TEMPS BY THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A MODERATELY TO POTENTIALLY 
STRONGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. IN 
ADDITION...AN INVERTED-V PROFILE IN THE LOWER LEVELS SHOULD 
ENCOURAGE DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS WITH SOME STORMS...WITH HIGH 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES (AROUND 2 INCHES) RESULTING IN LOCALLY 
HEAVY RAINFALL. OVERALL...IT APPEARS THAT ORGANIZED CONVECTION WILL 
LIKELY INTENSIFY AHEAD OF THE FRONT AND MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
BY THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. WITH THIS IN MIND...WITH MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL IN THE ZONE 
FORECASTS.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
UPDATE THIS MORNING TO MAKE A FEW TWEAKS TO TEMPS AND PRECIP 
WORDING. WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE HEAT ADVISORY FOR THE KNOXVILLE 
AND CHATTANOOGA AREAS FOR TODAY...ALTHOUGH AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS AND 
CONVECTIVE COVERAGE MAY KEEP HEAT INDICES A LITTLE LOWER THAN 
YESTERDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(T0DAY AND TONIGHT)...A CLUSTER OF STORMS WILL
CONTINUE TO MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLATEAU INTO SOUTHWEST
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THIS MORNING. SPC SHOWS CAPES UP
TO 2500 J/KG. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE ISOLATED DAMAGING WINDS AND
TORRENTIAL RAINS.

UPPER RIDGE THAT HAS BEEN PRODUCING EXCESSIVE HEAT OVER THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL WEAKEN SOME TODAY. EVEN SO...TEMPERATURES IN
THE MID AND UPPER 90S AND VERY HIGH DEWPOINTS (MID-UPPER 70S) WILL
PRODUCE HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA AGAIN FOR CHA AND TYS AREAS.

A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND
ENTER INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS TONIGHT. VERY UNSTABLE AIRMASS
ANTICIPATED WITH CAPES BETWEEN 2500-3500 J/KG. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE
THERMODYNAMIC DRIVEN DOWNBURSTS AND TORRENTIAL RAINS. WILL INCLUDE
WITHIN THE HWO.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS (NAM/GFS/ECMWF) STILL 
IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON MAIN FEATURES/PATTERN FOR THESE PERIODS. THE 
WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOOKS TO PICK UP ENOUGH SOUTHWARD PUSH TO MAKE 
IT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY NIGHT. THUS...MINOR TWEAK WAS 
TO REMOVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS A BIT EARLIER IN THE GRIDS ACROSS NRN 
MOST AREAS ON FRIDAY NIGHT AS DRIER AIR ADVECTS IN BEHIND FROPA.

KEPT LOW POPS OVER SRN AREAS ON SATURDAY THROUGH SUNDAY...THEN UPPER 
RIDGE BUILDS EAST AND LOOKS TO KEEP ANY RAIN CHANCES TO A MINIMUM 
FOR MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY. 05/00Z GFSX MOS HIGHS CAME IN HOTTER 
THAN PREVIOUS MAX TEMPS GENERALLY FOR THESE LATER DAYS...SO I NUDGED 
HIGHS UP BY A FEW DEGREES.  DURING THE ONGOING HEAT WAVE...I HAVE 
NOTICED THAT MOS HAS BEEN A FEW DEGREES TOO COOL ON MINS...SO I 
RAISED THE MIN TEMP GRIDS UP A COUPLE OF DEGREES EACH NIGHT...ONCE 
THE UPPER RIDGE STRENGTHENS ITS GRIP AGAIN.

WAS DEVELOPING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...WITH ADDITIONAL

COLD FRONT. WILL PLAN TO KEEP CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA

POSSIBILITY OF THIS OHIO RIVER VALLEY CONVECTION AFFECTING THE 
FORECAST AREA LATER THIS EVENING. THIS WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
SLOWLY APPROACH THE REGION ON THURSDAY...WITH VERY HOT TEMPS AND 
HIGH DEWPOINTS COMBINING AGAIN TO PRODUCE DANGEROUS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING HEAT INDICES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL GREAT TN VALLEY 
AREAS. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL INCREASING MID LEVEL WINDS AND COOLING 
MID LEVEL TEMPS ON THURSDAY...AS A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH 
AMPLIFIES OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION AND PUSHES THE COLD 
FRONT INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY THURSDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...THINK 
THAT ORGANIZED CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE AHEAD OF THE FRONT ON 
THURSDAY ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS CAUSING SOME STORMS TO BECOME SEVERE DURING THE AFTERNOON AND

THUNDERSTORM IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ON MONDAY AND TUESDAY. ENSEMBLE 
MEANS SHOW THE RIDGE RETROGRADING BACK INTO THE PLAINS STATES BY 
WEDNESDAY WITH UPPER LEVEL WINDS BECOMING MORE NORTHWESTERLY ACROSS

NRN PLATEAU AND SWRN VA...WHERE MOISTURE POOLS AHEAD OF THE WEAK 
COLD FRONT. SUMMERTIME FRONTS NEVER SEEM TO CLEARLY PUSH THROUGH THE 
FORECAST AREA...SO PREFER TO TAKE A WAIT AND SEE APPROACH FOR WHERE 
FRONT WILL BE LOCATED ON FRIDAY. NEIGHBORS TO THE NORTH AND EAST 
HAVE INCREASED THEIR POPS FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...WHICH 
SEEMS MOST REASONABLE TO ME FOR MY NRN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA.
THUS...RAISED POPS FOR NRN PLATEAU AND SWRN VA TO LOWER END OF 
LIKELY BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...AND A LESSER INCREASE IN POPS OVER 
REST OF THE AREA INTO THURSDAY NIGHT. 

BACKED OFF A DEGREE OR TWO FOR MAX TEMPS THURSDAY...GIVEN NEW MOS 
HIGHS AND THE INCREASE IN MOISTURE. HOWEVER...HEAT INDICES STILL 
LOOK HIGH ENOUGH TO WARRANT AN EXTENSION OF THE HEAT ADVISORY FOR 
THE SRN AND CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES ON THURSDAY.

OTHERWISE...ECMWF AND GFS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON UPPER RIDGE BUILDING 
FOR LATE WEEKEND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. THIS WILL BRING BACK THE HEAT 
AND KEEP RAIN CHANCES TO A MINIMUM. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED 
ON TRACK WITH VERY LITTLE CHANGES.

ISOLATED SHOWERS TRACKING THROUGH THE CWA...SO WILL THE FORECASTED 
POPS AS IS FOR TODAY. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON 
TRACK...NO CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LIGHT WINDS AND SOME AREAS OF
LOW CLOUDINESS (DUE TO WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW) ARE CREATING
SOME VERY MILD/MUGGY TEMPS THIS MORNING...MOSTLY 70 TO 80 DEGREES!

NO SHRA OR TSRA ON RADAR THIS MORNING...AND I THINK THAT ANY
CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON WILL BE VERY ISOLATED...AS UPPER RIDGE
DOMINATES. PREVIOUS POP/WX GRIDS WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

MAX TEMPS MONDAY WERE NOT AS HOT AS I HAD ANTICIPATED...DUE TO
LINGERING CLOUDINESS. HOWEVER...SUBSIDENCE ALOFT AND BETTER MIXING
TODAY SHOULD LEAD TO PLENTY OF SUNSHINE TO REACH 80S TO MID 90S BY
THIS AFTERNOON. RECORD HIGHS ARE NOT IN JEOPARDY AT CHA - 100...
AND TYS - 98...BUT MAY COME CLOSE AT TRI - 95. 

THE HEAT IS DEFINITELY ON AGAIN...AND THE HEAT ADVISORY LOOKS ON
TRACK FOR SRN VALLEY TODAY. WE EVEN CONSIDERED EXPANDING IT NORTH
TO THE CENTRAL VALLEY COUNTIES...BUT CRITERIA LOOKS TO BE MET THERE
ON WEDNESDAY...AFTER FALLING JUST SHORT FOR THIS AFTERNOON.

OTHERWISE...KEPT THE LOW EVENING POPS FOR TSRA WITH ANOTHER MILD TO
MUGGY NIGHT AHEAD. WENT WITH OR A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE A MOS BLEND
FOR MINS TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...STRONG UPPER RIDGE WILL 
REMAIN OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY. NEAR RECORD TO RECORD HIGHS ARE EXPECTED WEDNESDAY...EXCEPT
FOR CHA.  THE CURRENT RECORD HIGHS ARE THE FOLLOWING FOR 
WEDNESDAY:

CHA 105 (1947)     TYS 99 (1930)    TRI 94 (2002)

MAY NEED TO EXTEND HEAT ADVISORY INTO THE TYS AREA FOR WEDNESDAY.
AN UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEAST 
UNITED STATES THURSDAY INTO THE WEEKEND. ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL

FORECAST TONIGHT...ALTHOUGH IT IS POSSIBLE THERE COULD BE AN
ISOLATED SHRA/TSRA UNTIL MID EVENING IN THE MOUNTAINS/HIGH TERRAIN
AREAS IN SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE/SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. AM IN
GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH TEMPS ONLY FALLING TO NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS
BETWEEN GFS/NAM TONIGHT. 

THEREFORE...MAIN SHORT TERM ISSUE FOR FORECAST WILL BE HEAT.
ISSUING HEAT ADVISORY FOR SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...ESPECIALLY
CHATTANOOGA AREA...FOR HEAT ADVISORY CRITERIA EXPECTED TO BE
REACHED BY TUESDAY AFTERNOON. UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL
CONTINUE TO BUILD INTO THE AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY...AND WILL
CONTINUE HEAT ADVISORY INTO WEDNESDAY EVENING FOR SAME AREA IN
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...NO REAL REASON TO CHANGE 
THE PREVIOUS FORECAST OR THINKING MUCH. ADJUSTED A FEW POPS UP  TO 
ACCOUNT FOR TERRAIN ON WEDNESDAY. RIDGE WILL DOMINATE UNTIL THE 
NORTHEASTERN NOAM TROF FLATTENS IT LATER IN THE PERIOD, WITH THE 
OPPORTUNITY FOR A WEAK COLD FRONT TO SLIDE THROUGH. THIS COLD FRONT 
WILL DROP TEMPS BACK TO SEASONAL (READ: "MERELY HOT" RATHER THAN 
"BLISTERING") NORMALS. THIS ALSO LESSEN THE CHANCE FOR HEAT 
ADVISORIES LATER IN THE WEEK. KEPT TEMPS CLOSE TO MOS, AGAIN.

345 AM EDT MON AUG 2 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...00Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW THE
UPPER RIDGE ALREADY BUILDING EASTWARD...WITH FORECAST SOUNDINGS
SHOWING A STRONGER CAPPING INVERSION FOR TODAY. SINCE SO LITTLE
CONVECTION POPPED ON SUNDAY...IT WOULD APPEAR THAT VERY LITTLE WILL
DEVELOP LATER TODAY. HOWEVER...I DID KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
FAR ERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST AREA...NEAR RNK/GSP/FFC GRIDS. 

THE HOTTER GFS MOS MAX TEMPS LOOKED HARD TO DISAGREE WITH...AND
THE MILDER MINS BEST FOR TONIGHT.

DID A LITTLE RESEARCH ON THE NUMBER OF 90 DEGREE OR HIGHER MAX
TEMPS SO FAR THIS YEAR FOR OUR 4 MAIN VERIFICATION POINTS AND 
FOUND THE FOLLOWING NUMBERS FOR MAY 1ST THROUGH AUG 1ST THIS YEAR:

CHA - 47 DAYS (30 YEAR AVERAGE = 42.3)
TYS - 47 DAYS (30 YEAR AVERAGE = 31.2)
TRI - 34 DAYS (30 YEAR AVERAGE = 13.3)
OQT - 36 DAYS (30 TEAR AVERAGE = 27.7)

THE 30 YEAR AVERAGES ARE FOR THE ENTIRE YEAR...SO DEFINITELY
RUNNING WELL ABOVE THE AVERAGE NUMBERS THUS FAR...WITH A HOT WEEK
AHEAD!


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...BASICALLY KEPT WITH THE 
DIURNALLY OROGRAPHIC POP SCHEME FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS THE 
FORECAST AREA AWAITS THE ARRIVAL OF YET ANOTHER LONGWAVE WHICH 
AMPLIFIES OVER THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY. FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY MAINTAINED THE 30 PERCENT POPS FOR 
SCATTERED CONVECTION AS A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY BUILDS SOUTH THROUGH 
THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THE GFS AMPLIFIES THE 
UPPER TROF SUFFICIENTLY TO PUSH THE BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA LATER SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY SO KEPT POPS LOWER SATURDAY AND 
MAINTAINED LESS THAN 15 PERCENT POP FOR SUNDAY WITH THE POSSIBILITY 
OF LESS HUMID/MORE STABLE AIRMASS IN PLACE BY THIS TIME. STAYED 
RELATIVELY CLOSE TO MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS DURING THE LONG TERM PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...FRONT END OF SE MOVING MID LEVEL SPEED MAX PUSHING 
INTO SW VA THIS MORNING. UPPER RIDGING SHOULD BUILD IN SLOWLY FROM 
THE W IN WAKE OF IMPULSE. CANNOT REMOVE SCATTERED CONVECTION FROM 
THIS AFTN WITH DP BOUNDARY POISED ON OUR WESTERN EDGE. TEMPS OFF TO 
A SLOW START BUT SHOULD JUMP THIS AFTERNOON AS CLOUD COVER DECREASES.
NO UPDATE PLANNED. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SPOTTY TO SCATTERED CONVECTION 
CONTINUES TO DEVELOP EARLY THIS MORNING...WITH REMNANTS OF THE WEAK 
FRONT AND AN INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH IN OUR VICINITY. THE NW FLOW 
ALOFT IS MOVING THIS CONVECTION SE AT AROUND 20 MPH...WITH SOME 
BRIEF HEAVY RAINS...WHILE LITTLE LIGHTNING HAS BEEN INDICATED.

SHORT RANGE MODELS MOVE THE INVERTED SURFACE TROUGH AXIS SLIGHTLY
EAST THIS AFTERNOON...TO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU NORTH INTO ERN KY.
MODELS ALSO SUGGEST WEAK MOISTURE CONVERGENCE IN OUR HIGHER TERRAIN
AREAS (MTNS) IN THE EAST. OPTED TO INCREASE POPS SLIGHTLY FOR TODAY
IN THESE AREAS...PLUS EARLY TODAY WHERE ONGOING CONVECTION WAS
NOTED. ADDED SOME LOW POPS FOR THIS EVENING IN ERN MOST AREAS TO
BETTER MESH WITH NEIGHBORS GRIDS TO OUR EAST AND SE. AREAS OF FOG
LATE TONIGHT AFTER CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDINESS DISSIPATES. 

MAX TEMPS TRICKY AGAIN FOR TODAY...WITH A MOS BLEND A GOOD CHOICE. 
FOR MINS TONIGHT...WENT CLOSER TO THE MUGGIER NAM-WRF MOS.


LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL 
LESSEN AS THE RIDGE OVER CENTRAL NOAM BUILDS BACK EASTWARD. SERIES 
OF SMALL SHORT WAVES WILL CROSS THE AREA AND WITH VERY HIGH RH (PW'S 
AROUND 2.1)...THERE IS A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS EACH DAY. HEAT STAYS 
AROUND...SORRY FOLKS. IT'S THE DOG DAYS. STAYED NEAR HPC/MEX

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...EARLY MORNING CONVECTION
STARTING TO DEVELOP UPSTREAM IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...
WHICH SHORT RANGE MODELS WERE ALL SUGGESTING FOR TODAY. DEW POINT
TEMPS ON THE RISE...ESPECIALLY OVER CENTRAL AND SRN AREAS...SO
SLIGHTLY TO MODERATELY UNSTABLE TODAY WITH TEMPS REACHING 80S TO
LOWER 90S. MID TO HIGH CLOUDS ON THE INCREASE ALREADY...SO TEMPS
WILL BE OFF TO A MILD START THIS MORNING...BUT THE EARLY START TO
CONVECTION FAVORS MORE OF A BLEND OF MOS WHERE MAXES DIFFER. 

MAIN CHANGES TO GRIDS WERE TO INCREASE POPS FOR EARLY TODAY...
AND THEN TO BUMP POPS UP BY 15 TO 25 PERCENT FOR THE AFTERNOON
ACROSS THE BOARD. THIS MESHES BETTER WITH NEIGHBORS AND ALSO MORE
IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS POPS. 

EXPECT CONVECTION TO BE DIMINISHING FROM THE NW AFTER THIS EVENING
...WITH JUST A FEW MINOR TWEAKS MADE TO GRIDS FOR TONIGHT. MOS MINS
AND POPS WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED. MAY SEE SOME AREAS OF FOG LATE
TONIGHT...DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS DECREASE. 
 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A WEAK SURFACE LOW MOVES TOWARD 
AREA SUNDAY, AND HAVE ADDED SLIGHT CHANCE POPS TO WHOLE AREA. HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDS IN BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR MONDAY...EXCEPT FOR 
MOUNTAINS WITH NORTHWEST FLOW INFLUENCE, BUT STILL ONLY A SLIGHT 
CHANCE. A SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON TUESDAY...BUT BEST 
MOISTURE REMAINS ALONG THE MOUNTAINS SO WILL KEEP TUESDAY DRYISH FOR 
NOW WITH BARELY A SLIGHT CHANCE EVERYWHERE.  A BOUNDARY PUSHES INTO 
THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY AND LINGERS INTO FRIDAY. WITH STILL SOME 
UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING AND STRENGTH...WILL KEEP ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES 
EXPECTED FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. STAYED NEAR HPC/MEX GUIDANCE FOR 
TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGING OVER THE AREA 
WEAKENS AS UPPER HIGH CENTER SHIFTS WEST TOWARD OK THROUGH PERIOD. 
UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE NORTHWESTERLY AND INCREASES AS JET SEGMENT
PUSHES GENTLY INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY. WEAK SURFACE BOUNDARY 
APPROACHES THE AREA FROM THE NORTH. LOW LEVEL THICKNESS PACKING
REMAINS NORTH OF THE AREA. A FEW FORECAST CHALLENGES. CONDITIONS MAY 
REMAIN SOMEWHAT CLOUDY TONIGHT DUE TO UPSTREAM AND ONGOING 
CONVECTION AND MID LEVEL INVERSION THAT HAS BEEN DEVELOPING 
OVERNIGHT LATELY. THIS SHOULD NOT AFFECT WARM OVERNIGHT TEMPS MUCH. 
PCPN COVERAGE MAY BE UNDERDONE FOR THURSDAY WITH WARM UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS IN PLACE AND FAVORABLE NW STEERING. HARD TO GO LIKELY 
FOR CONVECTIVE  PCPN WITH NO SPECIFIC TRIGGER. MAX TEMPS THU ALSO A 
CONCERN WITH PCPN AND CLOUD COVER LIMITING SUNSHINE WHILE THICKNESS 
VALUES REMAIN RELATIVELY HIGH.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...NORTHWEST UPPER 
FLOW WILL PERSIST OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION THROUGH THE

NORTHWEST FLOW WILL SLOWLY TRANSITION FROM CYCLONIC TO ANTICYCLONIC 
AS UPPER THROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST PULLS AWAY AND UPPER RIDGING 
BUILDS BACK INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. ANTICIPATING GENERALLY DRY

SATELLITE SHOWED CONSIDERABLE CLOUDINESS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING TO MID AFTERNOON. A WEAK BOUNDARY 
ROUGHLY CORRESPONDS TO THIS BREAK ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. CURRENT 
RADAR SHOWS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS CONCENTRATED ACROSS CENTRAL KY 
AND WESTERN NC. A FEW STORMS WERE DEVELOPING OVER THE NORTHERN 
PLATEAU AND GENERALLY INCREASING. TEMPERATURES TODAY ARE SEVERAL 
DEGREES COOLER THAN MONDAY DUE TO MORE CLOUD COVER. EXPECTING A FEW 
STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS LATE THIS AFTERNOON AS TEMPERATURES REACH 
ABOUT 90 DEGREES. HEAVY RAINFALL MAY CAUSE LOCALIZED FLOODING 
ESPECIALLY WHERE HEAVY RAIN FELL MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. 

SHORT RANGE MODELS SHOW THE BOUNDARY OR OLD FRONT MOVING SLOWLY 
NORTH OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. ALSO THEY SHOW SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVING 
ACROSS KY AND THEN SE THROUGH SW VA AND NE TN INTO NC. UPPER RIDGE 
TO THE SOUTH WILL BUILD SLIGHTLY. FOR LATE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS VALLEYS AND LIKELY RAIN CHANCES 
EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SW VA DROPPING OFF OVERNIGHT TO SLIGHT CHANCE 
VALLEYS AND CHANCE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WEDNESDAY HAVE HIGHEST POPS 
AGAIN NE AND MOUNTAINS. EXPECTING LOWS TONIGHT SIMILAR TO THIS 
MORNINGS IN THE LOWER 70S AND HIGHS WEDNESDAY CLOSE TO THE HIGHER 
MAV GUIDANCE.      


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...NORTHERN STREAM 
TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE NORTHEASTERN CONUS BY THURSDAY PUSHING A 
BOUNDARY INTO THE VICINITY OF OUR FORECAST AREA. DYNAMICS NOT VERY 
STRONG WITH THIS FEATURE BUT ENOUGH MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY 
ACCOMPANIES BOUNDARY THAT AT LEAST SCATTERED CONVECTION APPEARS 
PLAUSIBLE. THUS HAVE CONTINUED MEDIUM CHANCE POPS ON THURSDAY. 
MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT BOUNDARY WILL EVENTUALLY BE PUSHED
SOUTH OF THE REGION WITH SOMEWHAT DRIER AIR BEHIND BOUNDARY. HAVE
CONTINUED DRY PERIODS ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. HAVE ALSO
CONTINUED WITH MAINLY DIURNAL POPS THROUGH THE BALANCE OF THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE WILL LINGER 
OVER THE AREA FOR THE SHORT TERM.  EXPECT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING.  WILL CARRY 
HIGH CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES TODAY...LOW CHANCE TONIGHT.  SHOULD BE 
ENOUGH CLOUD COVER AND PRECIP AROUND TO KEEP TEMPS LOWER THAN RECENT 
DAYS...BUT THINK EVEN HIGHER MAV TEMPS MAY BE A BIT LOW FOR MAX 
TEMPS TODAY...SO WILL BUMP UP MOST AREAS.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE 
FOR TONIGHT.         

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...AN UPPER RIDGE WILL REMAIN 
OVER THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY WITH A WEAK BOUNDARY DROPPING IN FOR 
OUT BEST CHANCE AT CONVECTION IN THE LONG TERM.  THE RIDGE SLIDES TO 
OUR WEST BY THURSDAY WITH FLOW ALOFT BECOMING NORTHWESTERLY.  WITH 
CONTINUED STRONG DAYTIME HEATING AND THE DIFFUSE BOUNDARY SLOWLY 
SLIDING TO OUR SOUTH...WILL CONTINUE TO SEE SCATTERED CONVECTION.  
WITH THE REMNANTS OF THE BOUNDARY TO OUR SOUTH ON FRIDAY...ISOLATED 
THUNDERSTORMS ACTIVITY WILL BE POSSIBLE MAINLY OVER THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE MRX CWA.  A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVES TRACK THROUGH THE 
REGION DURING THE REST OF THE EXTENDED.  CONFIDENCE QUITE LOW ON 
TIMING AND STRENGTH AND MADE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF CHANGES TO THE 
FORECAST...FOR GENERALLY 20 TO 30 POPS EACH DAY.  WILL SEE CONTINUED 
HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS WITH READING REMAINING ABOVE NORMAL FOR THE 
PERIOD...STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE.

.DISCUSSION...STILL GETTING SOME ISOLATED THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY IN 
THE CWA WITH STILL MORE ACTIVITY UPSTREAM. WILL UPDATE FORECAST TO 
KEEP CHANCE POPS INTO THE OVERNIGHT HOURS. WILL ALSO TWEAK 
TEMPERATURES A BIT TO MATCH CURRENT CONDITIONS. WILL ALSO ADD PATCHY 
FOG FOR TONIGHT...NOT WIDESPREAD ENOUGH FOR ADVISORY. REST OF THE 
FORECAST ON TRACK...NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED MAINLY OVER THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS OF THE PLATEAU WITH SOME REACHING SEVERE INTENSITY. SOME
CONVECTION MAY SPREAD INTO VALLEY AS OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES ARE
PRODUCED BY ONGOING CONVECTION. EXPECTED THIS ACTIVITY TO CONTINUE
THROUGH THE EARLY PORTIONS OF THE FIRST PERIOD BEFORE DIMINISHING
IN COVERAGE AND INTENSITY OVERNIGHT. ANTICIPATE MAINLY DIURNAL
ACTIVITY TO RETURN TOMORROW AS WEAK BOUNDARY REMAINS IN THE GENERAL
VICINITY. FOR TEMPS...STAYED CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE FOR THE MOST
PART.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER RIDGE 
RETROGRADES WEST BY EARLY IN THE LONG TERM PLACING SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. WEAK BOUNDARY APPROACHES 
FORECAST AREA BY THURSDAY. HOWEVER...NO MAJOR IMPACTS EXPECTED FROM 
THIS FEATURE. DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/ 
FORECAST AS MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION IS EXPECTED THROUGH MID WEEK 
IN NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME. KEPT POPS SOMEWHAT LOWER BY LATE WORK WEEK 
AS SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WORKS INTO THE REGION BEHIND BOUNDARY. WEAK 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH EMBEDDED IN NORTHWEST FLOW MAY INCREASE PRECIP 
CHANCES BY LATE NEXT WEEKEND...BUT EXACT TIMING UNCERTAIN AT THIS 
POINT. FOR TEMPS... GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX 
GUIDANCE. TEMPS EXPECTED TO REMAIN ABOVE CLIMO THROUGH THE LONG-TERM

AREA THIS MORNING. TEMPERATURES ARE RISING A LITTLE SLOWER TODAY AND
NOT SURE WE WILL REACH FORECAST HIGHS IN THE MID 90S EVEN AFTER

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAK AND SOMEWHAT DIFFUSE COOL 
FRONT TO OUR NORTH WILL STALL OVER THE REGION DURING THE SHORT 
TERM.  APPEARS THAT IT WILL NOT GET FAR ENOUGH SOUTH TO BRING ANY 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN AIRMASS FOR OUR AREA. SHOULD BE ENOUGH 
INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE AROUND FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION...SO WILL 
CARRY CHANCE POPS ALL ZONES TODAY INTO TONIGHT.  IT WILL STILL BE ON 
THE HOT SIDE...BUT MAX TEMPS EXPECTED TO BE A BIT LOWER THAN 
YESTERDAY.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.      

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL 
GRADUALLY SLIP BACK NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY INTO 
WEDNESDAY WHILE UPPER LEVEL RIDGING RETROGRADES SLOWLY WEST. LITTLE 
SIGNIFICANT CHANGE IN AIRMASS EXPECTED TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS 
MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY WILL REMAIN SUFFICIENT FOR THE DEVELOPMENT 
OF SCATTERED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH DAY. THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROF WILL AMPLIFY AS IT SHIFTS EAST 
ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. THIS WILL ALLOW FOR YET ANOTHER FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY TO MOVE SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATER THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY KEEPING A CHANCE FOR COOLING SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS GOING THROUGH THIS PERIOD. IF THE NORTHEASTERN STATES 
UPPER TROF UNDERGOES ENOUGH AMPLIFICATION...THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAY 
BE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA BY THE WEEKEND. WITH SLIGHTLY DRIER 
AIR IN PLACE BEHIND THE FRONT ALONG WITH AN INCREASE IN ATMOSPHERIC 
STABILITY...THE CHANCE FOR CONVECTION MAY BE DIMINISHED TO SOME 
DEGREE. TRENDED THE END OF THE FORECAST PERIOD THIS WAY WITH THE USE 
OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION.

ACTIVITY STILL POSSIBLE TONIGHT...WILL LEAVE CURRENT POPS AS IS.  
TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST APPEARS ON TRACK. NO 
CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...
A MOIST AIR MASS IS IN PLACE OVER THE TN VALLEY...AND WITH A FRONT
APPROACHING FROM THE NORTH TONIGHT AND TOMORROW...RAIN CHANCES WILL
BE INCREASING. EXPECT MAINLY SCATTERED COVERAGE THROUGH THE REST OF
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH THE BEST CHANCES NORTH CLOSER TO A
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH. STORMS SHOULD WANE AFTER SUNSET...BUT WEAK LOW
LEVEL CONVERGENCE IN THE MOIST AIR MASS WILL KEEP A CHANCE THROUGH
THE NIGHT. 

THE SURFACE FRONT WILL STALL JUST TO OUR NORTH ACROSS EASTERN KY
AND SOUTHERN WV...WITH A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH IN OUR VICINITY. THERE
WILL BE SOME WEAK UPPER DIVERGENCE TOMORROW...BUT WITH PRECIPITABLE
WATER VALUES WELL OVER 2 INCHES AND THE TROUGH ACROSS THE
AREA...NUMEROUS SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE EXPECTED ACROSS THE
ENTIRE AREA. HEAVY RAIN AND TRAINING STORMS WILL BE A THREAT DUE TO
VERY LIGHT STEERING WINDS. CLOUD COVER SHOULD HELP KEEP TEMPS IN
THE 85 TO 90 RANGE IN MOST SPOTS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
MODELS KEEP BERMUDA RIDGE FLATTENED AND TO THE SOUTHEAST OF THE
FORECAST AREA BY MONDAY NIGHT WITH WEAK BOUNDARY NEAR OR ALONG THE
SOUTHERN BORDER. SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA INTO PART OF THE EVENING BEFORE DECREASING. TUESDAY
MORE SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD BREAK OUT WITH CONSIDERABLE CLOUDS
AS BOUNDARY LINGERS. ACTIVITY WILL DECREASE AGAIN TUESDAY EVENING.
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES REMAIN NEAR 2.00 INCHES MONDAY NIGHT INTO
TUESDAY NIGHT SO THERE IS A RISK OF LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN. WEDNESDAY
RIDGE TRIES TO RESTRENGTHEN AS BOUNDARY WEAKENS AND MOVES NORTH SO
LESS COVERAGE AND SLIGHTLY WARMER TEMPERATURES. THURSDAY A NEW
BOUNDARY BEGINS TO SINK SOUTH INTO THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE
FORECAST AREA AS UPPER TROUGH DEVELOPS ACROSS THE NE STATES. THIS
FRONT LOOKS TO MOVE TO THE SOUTHERN BOUNDARY BY FRIDAY AND REMAIN
THERE OR JUST SOUTH OF THE TN/GA BORDER THROUGH THE WEEKEND. CLOUDS
AND RAIN WILL KEEP HIGH TEMPERATURES COOLER IN THE UPPER 80S TO MID
90S THROUGH THE EXTENDED. WILL FOLLOW THE HIGHER GUIDANCE NUMBERS
SINCE THE TREND FOR ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES HAS BEEN A PRESENCE
FOR THE LAST COUPLE WEEKS AND HOPE THAT CLOUDS AND RAIN WILL LOWER

ALREADY FIRED UP ACROSS THE AREA LAST HOUR OR SO. WITH UPPER RIDGE 
FLATTENING OUT DURING THE SHORT TERM...AND WEAK COOL FRONT SAGGING 
INTO THE AREA FROM THE NORTH...SHOULD SEE SCATTERED CONVECTION OVER

HEAT INDEX VALUES TO BE NEAR...BUT GENERALLY BELOW...HEAT ADVISORY 
CRITERIA FOR SOUTHERN AREAS AND CENTRAL VALLEY...SO WILL CONTINUE 
SPS FOR THOSE AREAS.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.  

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE MODELS GENERALLY AGREE 
THAT AN UPPER TROF WILL CONTINUE TO PRESS EAST ACROSS THE 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. KNOCKING THE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES 
BACK A FEW MILLIBARS AND ALLOWING A COOL FRONT TO MAKE PROGRESS INTO 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. RATHER DECENT MOISTURE...LIFT AND 
INSTABILITY WILL BE IN PLACE AHEAD OF THE FRONT FOR LIKELY POPS 
NORTH AND GOOD CHANCE PROBABILITIES SOUTH ON MONDAY. INCREASED THE 
CHANCE OF RAIN TO A LIKELY CATEGORY FOR ALMOST THE ENTIRE REGION ON 
TUESDAY WITH DEEP MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY IN PLACE ALONG WITH THE 
STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY IN THE AREA. GRADUALLY LOWERED THE CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY AS THE FRONT 
SHIFTS BACK NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. BY FRIDAY AND 
SATURDAY...ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROF WILL BE AMPLIFYING ACROSS THE 
NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION AND AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
DROP SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS INCREASING THE CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION AT THE END OF THE EXTENDED FORECAST PERIOD. TRENDED 
MAX/MIN TEMPS CLOSE TO MEX MOS GUIDANCE WHICH PROVIDES FOR 
MODERATING TEMPERATURES RESULTING FROM THE MORE ACTIVE WEATHER 
PATTERN WHICH FEATURES INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND BETTER CHANCES FOR

.DISCUSSION...PRECIPITATION ON THE DECLINE SO WILL UPDATE FORECAST

ON TRACK...NO OTHER CHANGES NEEDED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE ANCHORED OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST WILL BEGIN TO GIVE
WAY OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN SLIGHTLY COOLER
TEMPERATURES AND BETTER CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ACROSS
THE AREA FOR SUNDAY. DESPITE THE COOLER TEMPS WITH HIGHS IN THE MID
90S...DEW POINTS WILL REMAIN IN THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S
TOMORROW...SO THE HEAT INDEX SHOULD STILL EXCEED 100 IN THE
SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL TN VALLEY. WILL KEEP THE SPS GOING TO MENTION
THIS. 

A FRONT NEAR THE GREAT LAKES TODAY WILL PUSH TOWARD THE 
SOUTH...WEAKENING THE GRIP OF THE ATLANTIC RIDGE OVER THE AREA.
MOISTURE ADVECTION WILL INCREASE WITH A BETTER SOUTHERLY FLOW
PROVIDING GULF MOISTURE. THE MOS GUIDANCE SHOWS A PRETTY BIG SPREAD
IN POPS BETWEEN THE NAM AND THE GFS...WITH THE GFS BEING THE DRIER
OF THE TWO. FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE LESS CIN TO BE OVERCOME
TOMORROW AND HIGHER PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES. WILL MENTION CHANCE
POPS ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA...BUT NOT QUITE AS HIGH AS THE NAM.
BEST CHANCES APPEAR TO BE IN THE NORTHERN PLATEAU AND SW
VA...FARTHER FROM THE SUPPRESSING INFLUENCE OF THE RIDGE.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER TROF OVER THE 
NORTH CENTRAL STATES WILL MOVE INTO THE NORTHEASTERN STATES DURING 
THE BEGINNING OF NEXT WEEK. THE FLOW NOW MORE FROM THE NORTHWEST
WILL ALLOW THE COOL FRONT TO SLIDE SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS. THE CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE
HIGHEST FROM SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AS THE FRONT SETTLES OVER
THE NORTHERN PART OF THE FORECAST AREA. BY MIDWEEK THE FRONT
WEAKENS AND LIFTS BACK NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY THROUGH
FRIDAY. SATURDAY ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROF MOVES INTO THE NE STATES
AND ANOTHER COLD FRONT MAY MAKE IT INTO SW VA. TEMPERATURES WILL

KNOXVILLE. THE HEAT ADVISORY AND SPS WILL NOT BE CHANGED. 

THE GFS AND SREF CONTINUE TO SHOW SOME PRECIP THIS AFTERNOON IN SW

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER HIGH STILL TRYING TO 
MAINTAIN ITS HOLD ON THE AREA THIS MORNING AND THROUGH THESE THREE 
PERIODS...ALTHOUGH BY SUNDAY IT HAS SLID A BIT TO THE EAST. BIG
DISAGREEMENT IN THE MOS GUIDANCE...SOMEWHAT TODAY...BUT MORE-SO
TONIGHT AND SUNDAY. NAM IS QUITE AGGRESSIVE AND SEEMS TO BE THE
ODD-ONE-OUT THIS TIME AS OTHER MODELS KEEP THINGS PRETTY QUIET
OVERALL. PMDHMD SINGLED OUT THE NAM AS THE MODEL TO POSSIBLY LEAN
AWAY FROM. THEREFORE WILL OPT FOR THE DRIER SIDE OF THE FORECAST
THROUGH SUNDAY...HOWEVER NOT COMPLETELY DRY...A COLD FRONT OR AT
LEAST A PREFRONTAL TROUGH...SHOULD BE CLOSE ENOUGH TO WARRANT
CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY.

STILL TOASTY TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY...WILL KEEP HEAT ADVISORY GOING 
TODAY...AS HEAT INDEX OF 105 LOOKS ON TRACK AGAIN FOR KCHA...GOT TO 
106 YESTERDAY.  SUNDAY WILL BE CLOSE...BUT THINK INCREASING CLOUDS 
WILL KEEP HEAT INDEX JUST UNDER CRITERIA DURING THE DAY.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...A WEATHER PATTERN THE 
REGION HAS SEEN SEVERAL TIMES THIS SUMMER WILL COME TO THE RESCUE 
ONCE AGAIN AS AN UPPER ATMOSPHERIC TROF CURRENTLY OVER THE NORTH 
CENTRAL STATES MAKES PROGRESS INTO THE NORTHEASTERN U.S.  THE 
RESULTING WEST NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL HELP TO DRIVE A COOL FRONT 
SOUTH THROUGH THE CENTRAL INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE CHANCE 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE ESPECIALLY DURING THE 
FIRST THREE DAYS OF THE WORK WEEK WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY SLIPPING 
SOUTH INTO THE REGION. LATER IN THE DAY WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY THE 
FRONT WILL WEAKEN TAKING FOCUS FOR STORM DEVELOPMENT AWAY FROM 
CONVERGENCE ALONG THE BOUNDARY WITH A SLIGHT SHIFT TOWARD OROGRAPHIC 
INITIATION. BY FRIDAY ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROF WILL ARRIVE IN THE 
NORTHEASTERN PART OF THE COUNTRY AND YET ANOTHER COOL FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL DROP SLOWLY SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE 
FORECAST AREA. STAYED WITH A SMALL CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS ON FRIDAY AS OUTFLOW FROM POSSIBLE ORGANIZED 
CONVECTION ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY MAY SPARK STORM FORMATION 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. TRENDED 
TEMPS CLOSE TO IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE.

A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS HAVE POPPED UP IN NE TN AND SW VA...BUT ARE
HAVING A HARD TIME SURVIVING IN THE CAPPED ENVIRONMENT. ANY SHOWERS
SHOULD DISSIPATE BY SUNSET...AND WILL NOT CARRY ANY POPS THIS
EVENING. 

THE STRONG HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST CONUS WILL
REMAIN IN PLACE OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS...RESULTING IN PRIMARILY A
PERSISTENCE FORECAST. ONE SLIGHT DIFFERENCE TOMORROW IS A
LOW LEVEL SOUTHEASTERLY FETCH ACROSS SC...WHICH MAY LEAD TO MORE
UPSLOPE SHOWERS IN NC MOUNTAINS. CIN AND SUBSIDENCE SHOULD BE
SUFFICIENT TO PREVENT MUCH SHOWER DEVELOPMENT ELSEWHERE. WILL
INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE SMOKIES AND SW NC...OTHERWISE
TOMORROW LOOKS DRY AND HOT AGAIN. LOWS TONIGHT ARE EXPECTED TO BE
AROUND 75 DEGREES OR HIGHER IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY...WITH HEAT
INDEX VALUES TOMORROW BETWEEN 105 AND 108. THUS A HEAT ADVISORY
WILL BE ISSUED FOR THIS AREA TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WILL CONTINUE THE
SPS MENTIONING HEAT INDEX VALUES OF 100 TO 105 ACROSS THE

ANOTHER VERY WARM NIGHT SATURDAY NIGHT WITH ONLY ISOLATED SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS HIGHER ELEVATIONS PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS. SUNDAY
THE COLD FRONT MOVES SOUTH OF THE OHIO RIVER AND MOISTURE GETS
PUSHED INTO TH MS VALLEY AND THEN TN VALLEY FROM BONNIE.
TEMPERATURES WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER BUT ONLY EXPECTING 20 TO
30 PERCENT COVERAGE OF THUNDERSTORMS. HEAT INDEX VALUES STILL
EXPECTED TO BE 100 TO 105 ACROSS THE SOUTHERN VALLEY. SUNDAY NIGHT
AND MONDAY COLD FRONT DROPS DOWN EVEN CLOSER WITH LEFTOVERS OF

THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE/CHANCE LATER ON. MOST OF
THE SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS THAT OCCUR WILL BE DUE TO INSOLATION ON
TERRAIN. PROBABLY BE FAILY SLOW MOVING DUE TO WEAK STEERING WINDS
AND WILL THEREFORE CONTAIN BRIEF HEAVY RAIN. STILL HOT AND MUGGY
FOR THE MOST PART WITH GENERALLY LIGHT WINDS. LITTLE RELIEF IN

TERRAIN. PROBABLY BE FAILY SLOW MOVING DUE TO WEAK STEERING WINDS
AND WILL THEREFORE CONTAIN BRIEF HEAVY RAIN. STILL HOT AND MUGGY
FOR THE MOST PART WITH GENERALLY LIGHT WINDS. LITTLE RELIEF IN
SIGHT.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE FROM PREVIOUS 
FORECASTS. SORT OF RUN OUT OF NEW THINGS TO TALK ABOUT. BERMUDA
HIGH DOMINATES THE SCENE AS USUAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR. HOT,
HUMID, SOME MINOR INSTABILITY BUT LITTLE SFC LIFT OTHER THAN HEAT
AND EVEN SOME DIFFLUENCE GETS IN THE WAY OF THAT. ALOFT, THE TEMPS
ARE JUST TOO WARM TO ALLOW FOR MUCH IN THE WAY OF LAPSE RATES. SO
WE ARE LEFT WITH SHORT TOPPED, QUASI-ORGANIZED CONVECTION WITH
MAINLY SOME GUSTY WINDS AND LOTS OF BRIEF HEAVY SHOWERS. OVERNIGHT,
SKIES WILL CLEAR UP A BIT AND THERE WILL BE AREAS OF FOG,
ESPECIALLY ALONG THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND ADJACENT VALLEY UP INTO
SW VA. POPS DROP A BIT FOR TOMORROW, UNLESS THESE INVISIBLE WEAK
FINE LINES KEEP POPPING A FEW SHRA/TSRA. BIGGER STORY IS HEAT
STATEMENT STILL UP. WILL LOOK AT IT ON EITHER THE MIDNIGHT SHIFT OR
TOMORROW'S DAY SHIFT FOR UPGRADE TO HEAT ADVISORY. BIGGEST PROBLEM
WITH IT IS HAVING MIN TEMPS STAY UP HIGH ENOUGH OVER NIGHT TO MEET
CRITERIA.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE STAYS
CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHEAST STATES SATURDAY WITH HOT TEMPERATURES
IN THE MID TO UPPER 90S. CONVECTION LOOKS TO BE LIMITED TO THE
HIGHER ELEVATIONS. FROM SUNDAY THROUGH MID WEEK A COLD FRONT WILL
DROP INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TO JUST NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND
THEN LIFT BACK NORTH. THE RIDGE WILL FLATTEN OUT AND SHORTWAVE
ENERGY WILL MOVE SOUTH INTO THE TN VALLEY FOR A CHANCE OF AFTERNOON
AND EVENING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. LOW TEMPERATURES FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY NIGHTS WILL BE IN THE MID 70S IN THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL
VALLEYS. FROM SUNDAY ON HIGHS AND LOWS WILL BE A FEW DEGREES COOLER
BUT STILL ABOVE NORMAL.

.SHORT TERM...NO ECHOES SHOWING UP ON THE RADAR FOR NOW...BUT 
ANOTHER SHORTWAVE IS EXPECTED TO TRACK ACROSS THE CWA TODAY. DEEPEST 
MOISTURE REMAINS NORTH...SO WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE 
NORTH AND CENTRAL. WITH INCREASING INSTABILITY EXPECTED...COULD SEE 
A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS 
AGAIN. THE ACTIVITY SHOULD DIMINISH DURING EVENING HOURS AS THE 
DISTURBANCE EXITS THE AREA...SO WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES EARLY 
FOR TONIGHT. ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES ARE EXPECTED AGAIN TODAY AND 
TONIGHT. HEAT INDICES IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY SHOULD BREAK 100 
DEGREES THIS AFTERNOON WHILE THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD NEAR A HEAT 
INDEX OF 100 DEGREES. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR 
TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...LONG-RANGE MODELS APPEAR TO 
BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE STRENGTHENING OF AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH 
OVER THE SOUTHEAST ON FRIDAY...WHICH WILL RESULT IN CONFINING 
ISOLATED CONVECTION TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND HOTTER TEMPS OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA INTO SATURDAY. IN FACT...IT APPEARS THAT HEAT 
INDICES WILL BE OVER 100 DEGREES FOR SEVERAL HOURS ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN AREAS OF THE GREAT TN VALLEY ON FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON AND AGAIN ON SATURDAY AFTERNOON. THUS...WILL CONTINUE THE 
SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO ADDRESS THIS POTENTIALLY DANGEROUS 
HEAT. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS SEEM TO AGREE THAT A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL 
APPROACH THE REGION BY SUNDAY NIGHT...AND STALL OUT AROUND THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK. WHILE THIS FRONT WON'T BRING MUCH 
COOLER AIR...IT SHOULD INCREASE CLOUDS AND THE CONVECTIVE COVERAGE 
ENOUGH TO PROVIDE SOME RELIEF TO THE HEAT. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND 
CLOSE TO THE GFS MOS NUMBERS THROUGH THE PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

INSTABILITY IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE IN THE AREA BUT PW'S ARE PRETTY 
HIGH AND EXPECTED TO INCREASE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 
PRETTY MUCH A REPEAT OF YESTERDAY AND LAST EVENING. LOOKING FOR SOME 
STORMS TO PRODUCE STRONG GUSTY WINDS BORDERING ON SEVERE CRITERIA

UNTIL THE BIG BERMUDA HIGH MOVES ON OUT IT WILL STAY THIS WAY, 
TYPICAL MID SUMMER WEATHER.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL DOMINATE WEATHER OVER THE REGION INTO THE WEEKEND.  THE RESULT 
WILL BE CONTINUE HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS WITH SCATTERED 
THUNDERSTORMS OCCASIONALLY DEVELOPING AND MOVING ACROSS THE AREA.  
THE BEST CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WILL CONTINUE TO BE DURING 
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS OVER HIGHER TERRAIN.  A WEAKENING 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL MOVE INTO THE AREA AROUND THE SUNDAY/MONDAY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE MID WEST AND MID MS 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH A VERY MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL A MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM 
(MCS) OVER CENTRAL ILLINOIS...WHICH WAS MOVING EAST-SOUTHEAST 
TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS MCS WILL MOVE 
MOSTLY TO THE EAST ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY TODAY...DUE TO ZONAL 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW. HOWEVER...THINK THAT OUTFLOW FROM THIS MCS SHOULD 
AT LEAST TRIGGER SCATTERED CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AGAIN. 
THUS...WILL MENTION SCATTERED CONVECTION EVERYWHERE WITH THE HIGHEST 
POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS PATTERN OF 
MCS DEVELOPMENT OVER THE MID MS AND OHIO RIVER VALLEYS POSSIBLY 
MOVING TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA WILL LIKELY CONTINUE TONIGHT. IT IS 
POSSIBLE THAT ANOTHER MCS OVER THE MID WEST COULD MOVE TOWARDS THE 
FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...BUT FOR NOW WILL ONLY INCLUDE SMALL POPS 
THROUGH THE NIGHT SINCE ANY ADDITIONAL MCS ACTIVITY MIGHT WAIT UNTIL 
WEDNESDAY TO AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST...BUT WITH MAXES A FEW DEGREES 
HIGHER TODAY THAN YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH 
THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH 
WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE IS PROGGED. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TRACKS 
THROUGH THE REGION ON THURSDAY. WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE 
NORTH AGAIN WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE LINGERS. HIGH PRESSURE 
RETURNS ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...BUT MAY STILL SEE SOME ISOLATED 
DIURNAL ACTIVITY BOTH DAYS AS THE INSTABILITY INCREASES....BUT MOST 
OF THE STORMS SHOULD BE IN THE UPSLOPE REGIONS. A BOUNDARY TRACKS 
INTO THE REGION ON SUNDAY AND LINGERS INTO MONDAY. WITH SOME 
UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING...WILL KEEP ONLY SLIGHT CHANCES POPS FOR NOW.

THE MCS WAVE TRAIN EVIDENT IN SATELLITE AND RADAR IMAGERY OVER THE 
MIDWEST. 1000-500 MB THICKNESS PATTERN AND WEST NORTHWESTERLY MEAN 
FLOW SHOULD BRING THIS SYSTEM TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA LATER 
TONIGHT. NOT CONVINCED THAT IT WILL HOLD TOGETHER SUFFICIENTLY FOR 
WIDESPREAD HIGHER POPS SO USED SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE 
POSSIBILITY. MODELS HAVE A TRAILING MESOSCALE CONVECTIVE SYSTEM MOVE 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY. STAYED WITH A SLIGHT THROUGH 
MEDIUM CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR CONVECTION WITH EMPHASIS IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN. SOME UNCERTAINTY IN THE FORECAST FOR WEDNESDAY AS MODELS 
INDICATE UPPER RIDGE BEGINNING TO STRENGTHEN ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN 
U.S. BUT TRY TO INCREASE POPS TO SOME DEGREE WITH ADDITIONAL MCS 
ACTIVITY IN THE NEVER ENDING WEST NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT. TRIED TO 
HAVE A LITTLE HIGHER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA 
AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE CLOSER TO THE NORTHWARD ADVANCING MCS WAVE 
TRAIN. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MOS MAX/MIN TEMP GUIDANCE. 
HOWEVER...ADJUSTED MAXES A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW MOS BLEND FOR 
TUESDAY.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BE POSITIONED OVER THE SOUTHERN U.S. DURING THE FIRST HALF OF THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SCATTERED TSRA CONTINUE
OVER SRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH ISOLATED
TSRA OVER NRN HALF. THIS ACTIVITY SEEMS TO BE PURELY DIURNAL...WITH
ALL INSTABILITY AND LITTLE TO NO SHEAR...OR UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT
NOTED. MOVEMENT IS NE AT 15 TO 20 MPH...AND EARLY GRIDS WERE DRAWN
FOR THESE TSRA TO CONTINUE PROPAGATING NE INTO THE EVENING HOURS.

UPSTREAM OF OUR REGION...THE MCS IS DROPPING SOUTHWARD FROM THE MID 
MS VALLEY REGION...MOVING INTO WRN TN WHERE SPC MESO PAGE SHOWS 
HIGHEST INSTABILITY AND A THETA-E RIDGE. SATELLITE PICS SHOW TOPS 
WARMING...BUT ACTIVITY COULD DEVELOP OVER CENTRAL KY AND MIDDLE TN 
ALONG ANY OUTFLOW BOUNDARY TONIGHT. THUS...SHORT RANGE MODELS 
DEPICTION OF OVERNIGHT TSRA REACHING NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA SEEMS 
REASONABLE. 

HARDER CALL FOR MONDAY...DEPENDING ON HOW FAR MCS PUSHES OVERNIGHT.
HOWEVER...THINK THAT 50 TO 60 PERCENT POPS ARE IN ORDER FOR MONDAY
...DECREASING TO LESS THAN 30 PERCENT BY MONDAY NIGHT. MODELS DIFFER 
ON PATTERN FOR TUESDAY...WITH GFS SHOWING ANOTHER VORT MAX/MCS TO 
GENERATE MORNING TSRA...WHILE NAM LOOKS DRIER WITH MORE OF A ZONAL 
FLOW ALOFT. LEANING MORE WITH NAM...SO OPTED FOR A MOS BLEND ON POPS 
WHICH KEEPS CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND ADJACENT NWS GRIDS.

GFS MOS WAS CLOSELY FOLLOWED FOR TEMPS EACH PERIOD.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...FOR THE PAST FEW DAYS 
MODELS HAVE BEEN JUST A BIT SLOWER TO ALLOW THE ADVERTISED 
RE-EMERGENCE OF THE UPPER RIDGE. THEREFORE...DID A SLIGHT UPWARD 
ADJUSTMENT OF POPS FOR WEDNESDAY TO WIDESPREAD SLIGHT CHANCE WITH 
LOW CHANCE PROBABILITY ON THE HIGHER TERRAIN AND ACROSS MUCH OF 
EXTREME SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. THE RIDGE FINALLY BUILDS ON THURSDAY 
FRIDAY AND SATURDAY LIMITING CONVECTION TO A LARGE DEGREE. BY SUNDAY 
THE UPPER RIDGE BREAKS DOWN ENOUGH TO ALLOW A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
TO SHIFT SOUTH THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE REGION. ADDED 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SUNDAY WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF SLIGHTLY 
BETTER INSTABILITY AND MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF THIS FEATURE. 
TRENDED MAX TEMPS THROUGH THE PERIOD CLOSE TO IF NOT A COUPLE 
DEGREES UNDER NEW MEX MOS MAXIMUM TEMP GUIDANCE.

TODAY SEEMS TO BE THE MESOSCALE COMPLEX DROPPING SE INTO THE MID 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION. SHORT RANGE MODELS WOULD SUGGEST THIS 
COULD AFFECT OUR REGION BY THIS EVENING. CLEARLY SOMETHING TO WATCH 
CLOSELY FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS.

MEANWHILE...AIRMASS OVER OUR REGION IS MODERATELY UNSTABLE WITHOUT 
EVEN MODIFYING THE 12Z OHX OR RNK SOUNDINGS. OHX SOUNDING SHOWS 
NEARLY 2000 J/KG AND NO CAPPING INVERSION LEFT...WHILE RNK SOUNDING 
SHOWED SIMILAR INSTABILITY WITH A WEAK CAP. CONVECTION IS DEVELOPING 
ALREADY OVER NE PARTS OF MIDDLE TN AND MOVING NE AT AROUND 15 MPH...
WHILE SPOTTY CONVECTION WAS ALSO NOTED TO OUR SOUTH OVER NE AL AND 
NRN GA. SHORT RANGE MODELS AND MOS HAVE BEEN OVER PLAYING TSRA 
COVERAGE OVER THE PAST DAYS...SO I PREFER TO KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING 
FOR THE AFTERNOON FOR NOW. THUS...FORECAST GRIDS WON'T LIKELY NEED

OUT OF THE NE PARTS OF OUR FORECAST AREA. BEST WIND SHEAR AND WEAK
DIVERGENCE ALOFT DOES LINGER ACROSS SW VA AND NE CORNER OF TN...
WITH TWO MAIN AREAS OF LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE...TO OUR N OVER SE KY
AND TO OUR S ACROSS NRN AL AND NRN GA. POSSIBLY SOME WEAK SPIN
NOTED ON SATELLITE PICS IN THE BASE OF THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS
...BUT THINK MOST CONVECTION WILL DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET. SHORT
RANGE MODELS SPREAD THE AL/GA CONVECTION NE INTO SE TN AND SW NC
...WHILE RUC MODEL SPREADS A GOOD DEAL OF CONVECTION FROM SE KY
INTO SW VA AND NE TN THIS EVENING. THIS SEEMS REASONABLE...SO
HIGHER CHANCE POPS WERE USED FOR THOSE AREAS...WHILE SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS WERE USED ELSEWHERE. WORDED AS ISOLATED OR SCATTERED FOR
COVERAGE. LINGERING CLOUD COVER SUPPORTS THE MILDER GFS MINS OR
EVEN A DEGREE OR TWO ABOVE GFS.

FOR LATER PERIODS...EXPECT MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION FOR SUNDAY AND
SUNDAY NIGHT...WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS STILL ON TRACK. MODELS HINT AT
A MESOSCALE COMPLEX DEVELOPING LATE SUNDAY NIGHT AND AFFECTING OUR
AREA INTO MONDAY. THIS ALSO SEEMS REASONABLE...BUT FELT IT WAS A
BIT EARLY TO WARRANT LIKELY POPS...SO STAYED WITH HIGH CHANCE FOR
NOW. OTHERWISE...CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS TEMPS AND POPS FOR
SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MEAN UPPER TROF HOLDS 
OVER THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION THROUGH APPROXIMATELY 
MID WEEK KEEPING UNSETTLED WEATHER IN PLACE WITH POSSIBILITY OF 
SCATTERED CONVECTION. BY THURSDAY UPPER RIDGING WILL HAVE 
STRENGTHENED SUFFICIENTLY TO LIMIT CONVECTION TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN 
WITH MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA RAIN FREE. MAINTAINED THIS LOOK TO 
THE FORECAST THROUGH FRIDAY BUT BY SATURDAY ANOTHER UPPER TROF DROPS 
THROUGH THE NORTH CENTRAL STATES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. PUSHING 
A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. INTRODUCED A SLIGHT

253 PM EDT FRI JUL 16 2010

.SHORT TERM...TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT HAS EASED 
SLIGHTLY EASTWARD THIS AFTERNOON...WITH ISOLATED TO SCATTERED 
CONVECTION DEVELOPING WELL IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT. STORMS GENERALLY 
MOVING SE AT 15 MPH...AND OCNLY PULSING BRIEFLY IN INTENSITY. STORMS 
STAYING WELL BELOW STRONG TO SEVERE THUS FAR. MAX TEMPS CLIMBING TO 
TOP OUT JUST ABOVE YESTERDAY'S MAXES.

WEAK FRONT SHOULD STALL ACROSS SE KY AND NE TN VICINITY LATE TONIGHT 
PLUS THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH DEEPENS OVERNIGHT. THUS...CARRIED POPS 
FOR THE ENTIRE NIGHT...WITH A THIN RIBBON OF LOW LIKELY POPS ACROSS 
NRN PLATEAU INTO LEE/WISE COUNTIES OF SWRN VA. RAN CHANCE POPS 
ELSEWHERE...RANGING FROM 50 PERCENT NORTH TO 35 PERCENT SOUTH.

FRONT AND UPPER TROUGH SUPPORT CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SATURDAY...BUT 
FALL BELOW LIKELY BY SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY. THIS IS DUE TO WEAK 
FRONT MOVING NORTH OR DISSIPATING...AND WEAK RIDGING ALOFT. ALTHOUGH 
I LIKED THE DRIER LOOK OF THE NAM MODEL FOR SUNDAY...BOTH GFS AND 
ECMWF SUPPORT AT LEAST HIGH CHANCE POPS SUNDAY. THUS...MADE LITTLE 
IF ANY CHANGES TO POPS FOR SUNDAY FOR NOW. ADDED PATCHY LATE NIGHT 
FOG FOR BOTH NIGHTS. OTHERWISE...CLOSELY FOLLOWED THE GFS MOS FOR 
MAX AND MIN TEMPS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...ADDITIONAL SHORTWAVE 
ENERGY DROPS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE MIDWEST WHILE DRAGGING A COOL 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS 
MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. STAYED WITH THE SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE POPS 
FOR CONVECTION WITH SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY PRESSING A LITTLE CLOSER TO 
THE FORECAST AREA. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE EXPANDS AGAIN ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WEDNESDAY THROUGH FRIDAY KEEPING THUNDER 
SUPPRESSED. CONVECTION SHOULD MAINLY BE LIMITED TO HIGHER TERRAIN 
FEATURES DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. GENERALLY STAYED JUST 
UNDER MEX MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS.

.DISCUSSION...RELATIVELY CLOUD AND FOG FREE START TO THE DAY THIS 
MORNING IN THE WARM/HOT AIRMASS AHEAD OF THE SLOW MOVING COLD FRONT.
13Z SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS THIS FRONT FROM SW CORNER OF KY NE TO 
NEAR LEXINGTON AND INTO SE OHIO (JUST PAST DAYTON).  DEW POINT TEMPS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA RUNNING IN THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S...BUT MAY
DROP SLIGHTLY WITH MIXING. 

12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW THAT OUR MID LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION HAS 
WEAKENED SLIGHTLY FROM YESTERDAY...WITH LITTLE NEGATIVE CAPE TO 
OVERCOME.  MODIFIED SOUNDINGS SHOW MODERATE INSTABILY FOR REACHING 
80S TO MID 90S...WITH AROUND 1200 J/KG (RNK) TO 2500 J/KG (OHX).
FREEZING LEVEL REMAINS EXTREMELY HIGH (GREATER THAN 16000 FT) AS 
DOES WET BULB ZERO HEIGHT (GREATER THAN 13000 FT).  MAY SEE A SLIGHT 
INVERTED-V LOOK TO SOUNDINGS THIS AFTERNOON...WITH SOME MIXING IN 
THE LOWER LEVELS...SO MAIN THREAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE GUSTY DOWNBURST 
WINDS.  ISOLATED TO SCATTERED AFTERNOON CONVECTION EXPECTED...WITH
BEST COVERAGE IN HIGHER TERRAIN.

NOT MUCH UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT NOTED...UNTIL UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS 
DEEPENS LATER TONIGHT AND SATURDAY.  STORM MOTION LOOKS ON THE SLOW 
SIDE (SE AT 10 MPH OR SO)...WITH HIGH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES
SO SOME BRIEF LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS COULD OCCUR.

FORECAST GRIDS APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK...SO AT THIS POINT PLAN TO JUST 
MONITOR HOURLY CONDITIONS...AND REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING FROM THE 
ZFP.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
COLD FRONT STRETCHING FROM NEAR DETROIT SOUTHWEST TO NEAR PADUCAH 
AND INTO THE OZARKS REGION. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY 
APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...TRIGGERING A FEW TSTORMS IN THE 
AFTERNOON...MAINLY ALONG THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. MODEL SOUNDINGS 
REVEAL A MID-LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION GRADUALLY ERODING AWAY THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. IN ADDITION...AN INVERTED-V PROFILE IS PROGGED TO 
DEVELOP IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER...WHICH SHOULD ENCOURAGE THE THREAT OF 
DAMAGING WINDS WITH SOME STORMS. THE COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO BECOME 
LOCATED AROUND THE NORTHERN TN BORDER BY THIS EVENING...WITH AN 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH BECOMING MORE AMPLIFIED OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF 
THE NATION. THUS...A BETTER COVERAGE OF STORMS SHOULD OCCUR TONIGHT 
AND LINGER THROUGH THE NIGHTTIME HOURS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST...BUT WITH SLIGHTLY HIGHER 
MAXES FOR THIS AFTERNOON (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY). 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...RETURN TO HOT AND 
GENERALLY DRY CONDITIONS EXPECTED BY THE LATTER PORTION OF THE LONG 
TERM AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS BACK OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS PER 
MEDIUM RANGE MODELS/ENSEMBLES CONSENSUS. HOWEVER...A WEAK FRONT
WILL COMBINE WITH DEEP MOISTURE FOR SOMEWHAT UNSETTLED CONDITIONS
TO START THE LONG TERM ON SATURDAY. HAVE CONTINUED LIKELY POPS FOR
THAT PERIOD. FRONT AND MOISTURE WILL LINGER IN THE AREA THROUGH THE
BALANCE OF THE WEEKEND AND INTO EARLY NEXT WORK WEEK. CONTINUED
SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THIS TIME FRAME FOR MAINLY
DIURNAL CONVECTION. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM

UPPER RIDGE WEAKENS SIGNIFICANTLY BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...BUT FRONT

SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE RANGE...SIMILAR TO A BLEND OF MOS.
CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT LEADING INTO LIKELY FOR SATURDAY...

SIMILAR MOS MAX/MIN TEMPS...BUT A LITTLE ABOVE MOS POPS FOR

.DISCUSSION...LATEST SURFACE MAP PLACES COLD FRONT THROUGH OUR 
FORECAST AREA...ALTHO A CLOSER LOOK AT 13Z SURFACE MAP SHOWS A GOOD 
DEW POINT DISCONTINUITY MIDWAY BETWEEN TRI AND TYS. A MODIFIED 12Z 
OHX SOUNDING HAS MODERATE INSTABILITY IF TEMPS HIT 80S TO LOWER 90S 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH POSITIVE CAPES OF GREATER THAN 2000 J/KG.
THUS...AN ISOLATED TSRA COULD POP UP OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN OVER 
THE SMOKIES AND SRN MTNS IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY.

HOWEVER...12Z UPPER AIR PLOTS SHOW THAT THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS 
IS NOW EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS...SO WON'T ADD ANY SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS.

OTHERWISE...FOG IS DISSIPATING AND THE LOW CLOUDS ARE LIFTING. WILL 
FRESHEN THE HOURLY GRIDS AND REMOVE THE MORNING FOG WORDING SHORTLY.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SKIES ARE MOSTLY CLOUDY THIS
MORNING WITH TEMPERATURES IN THE MID 60S HIGHER ELEVATIONS TO LOWER
70S VALLEYS. THE UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AXIS HAS SHIFTED EAST OF THE
APPALACHIANS THIS MORNING TAKING THE LAST OF THE SHOWERS WITH IT.
UPPER LEVEL RIDGING OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL AND CENTRAL STATES WILL
BUILD TO THE EAST AND NORTHEAST AS UPPER TROUGH SHIFTS EAST AND
NORTHEAST OFF THE COAST. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE TRAPPED NEAR THE GROUND
AND RAINFALL TUESDAY WILL CREATE SOME PATCHY DENSE FOG THROUGH MID
MORNING. LOW CLOUDS ARE STILL IN PLACE ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL
SECTIONS SO FOG MAY NOT BE AS PREVALENT THERE. HIGHS TODAY A FEW
DEGREES WARMER THAN TUESDAY. TONIGHT LOWS SHOULD BE SLIGHTLY COOLER
THAN THIS MORNING AS SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WILL WORK IN WITH RIDGING
ALOFT TODAY.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...BERMUDA HIGH RIDGE AXIS 
EXTENDS INTO THE NE GULF OF MEXICO WITH MRX CWA UNDER LIGHT SW LOW 
LEVEL FLOW THROUGH THE PERIOD. WEAK RIDGING ALOFT BREAKS DOWN 
THURSDAY. TROF DEVELOPS OVER TN RVR VLY POISED BETWEEN LARGE FOUR 
CORNERS AND ATLANTIC HIGH PRESSURE CELLS. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN 
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPS AND ENHANCED...MAINLY DIURNAL PCPN CHANCES. 
SATURDAY POPS MAY BE UNDERDONE WITH UPPER TROF DEVELOPMENT REACHING 
ITS DEEPEST EXTENT TO OUR WEST. AS TROF WEAKENS AND DRIFTS INTO 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD...THE 
POTENTIAL FOR A MCS DROPPING DOWN IN NW FLOW INCREASES BUT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...ABRUPT END TO CONVECTION 
ANTICIPATED EARLY IN THE FIRST PERIOD AS UPPER TROUGH AXIS SWINGS 
THROUGH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHAIN REGION. MUCH DRIER AIR AT ALL 
LEVELS FOLLOWS TROUGH AXIS AS FLOW BECOMES NORTHWESTERLY. SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS INTO THE REGION FOR TOMORROW RESULING IN
GENERALLY DRY CONDITIONS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE
FROM MAV GUIDANCE AS THEY APPEAR REASONABLE.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL BE LOCATED OVER THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...WHILE A MIDLEVEL 
RIDGE WILL EXTEND FROM THE SOUTHERN MS VALLEY ACROSS THE TN VALLEY. 
SUBSIDENCE BENEATH THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS WILL STRENGTHEN A MIDLEVEL 
INVERSION AND SUPPRESS CONVECTION ON THURSDAY. HIGHS WILL REACH THE 
LOWER TO MID 90S IN MOST SPOTS.

THE UPPER RIDGE CENTERED OVER THE SOUTHERN MS VALLEY REGION 
RETROGRADES TOWARD THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND SOUTHERN ROCKIES. BETWEEN 
THIS RIDGE AND THE BERMUDA HIGH...A TROUGH SETS UP OVER THE OHIO AND 
TN VALLEYS FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. MODELS ARE IN REASONABLY GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THIS GENERAL PATTERN AND HAVE SHOWN GOOD RUN-TO-RUN 
CONTINUITY. THOUGH THE ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT WILL STALL WELL TO 
OUR NORTH...A MOIST AND UNSTALBE AIR MASS UNDER WEAK DIFFLUENCE 
ALOFT WILL ENHANCE THE CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EACH 
DAY. WILL INCREASE POPS A BIT BOTH DAYS...BUT WILL KEEP IN THE 
CHANCE RANGE FOR NOW. CLOUD COVER SHOULD HOLD HIGH TEMPS BACK TO THE 
80S ON SATURDAY.

THE MODELS BEGIN TO DIVERGE ON THEIR SOLUTIONS FOR THE BEGINNING OF 
NEXT WEEK...WITH CONSIDERABLE SPREAD AMONG THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS. 
THUS CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON THE DETAILS OF THE FORECAST. GENERALLY 
SPEAKING...THE PATTERN BECOMES SLIGHTLY MORE PROGRESSIVE ON SUNDAY 
AS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS RIDGE SHIFTS SLOWLY TOWARD THE EAST AND THE 
UPPER TROUGH MOVES OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST. THIS PATTERN APPEARS 
FAVORABLE FOR MCS DEVELOPMENT OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS...AND WITH A 
NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT...THE REMANTS OF THESE COULD AFFECT OUR AREA 
EACH DAY. WILL CARRY CHANCE POPS EACH DAY WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
EACH NIGHT...WITH TEMPS ABOVE NORMAL.

DEGREE OF CLEARING...IF ANY. DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV GUIDANCE 
DUE TO UNCERTAINTY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
PRECIP SHOULD BEGIN TAPERING OFF FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGH TUESDAY 
NIGHT AS THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH AXIS PASSES THROUGH THE AREA AND A 
DEVELOPING NORTHWEST FLOW ADVECTS DRIER AIR ALOFT. WILL HAVE 
CATEGORICAL TO LIKELY POPS BEFORE 06Z...FOLLOWED BY CHANCE TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS AFTER. MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE

305 AM EDT SAT JUL 10 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK COLD FRONT...DEFINED BY 
WIND SHIFT...CURRENTLY ACROSS NORTH PART OF MRX CWA. SHORT WAVE OVER 
KY WILL MOVE SE AWAY FROM THE AREA EARLY TODAY. FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WILL REPOSITION TO SE OF THE AREA TODAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD 
INTO THE AREA IN WAKE OF FRONT. LAYER DRYING WILL OCCUR EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD AND CONTINUE OVERNIGHT SO CHANCE FOR PRECIPITATION WILL TAPER 
OFF EARLY TODAY. SURFACE WINDS WILL CLOCK THROUGH THE NORTH. 
TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE NEAR NORMAL TODAY AND SLIGHTLY BELOW NORMAL 
TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL KEEP GULF MOISTURE-INSTABILITY SOUTH AND WEST OF THE FORECAST 
AREA SUNDAY. SURFACE HIGH PULLS EAST OF THE SPINE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS MONDAY WITH RETURN OF MOISTURE-INSTABILITY. PWS 
INCREASE TO 1.8 INCHES AND CAPES 2000 J/KG. LOW CONVECTIVE 
TEMPERATURE WILL ALLOW SCATTERED TO BROKEN (HIGHER ELEVATION) 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP BOTH MONDAY-TUESDAY. MODELS ALSO DEPICT A WEAK 
SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. CONFIDENCE OF THIS 
WAVE IS LOW AND IS LIKELY CONVECTIVELY INDUCED.

AS A UPPER TROUGH  MOVES ACROSS THE NORTHERN-CENTRAL PLAINS 
WEDNESDAY...UPPER RIDGE STRENGTHENS OVER THE SOUTH...BUT NOT ENOUGH 
TO LIMIT DIURNAL CONVECTION. AS NORTHERN UNITED STATES UPPER TROUGH 
MOVES EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES BY FRIDAY...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
SOUTH ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. CONFIDENCE 
ON TIMING AND LOCATION OF FRONT LOW...BUT WILL MAINTAIN DIURNAL 
CONVECTION THROUGH FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT CURRENTLY IN 
THE VICINITY OF THE OHIO RIVER WILL CONTINUE TO SLIDE SOUTH AND 
SOUTHEAST OVERNIGHT...AND SHOULD BE OVER OUR SOUTHERN AREAS BY 
SATURDAY MORNING...AND THEN SOUTH OF OUR AREA BY SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON.  CONVECTION HAS FIRED OVER THE AREA AHEAD OF THIS 
FRONT...AND WILL CARRY LIKELY POPS NORTHERN HALF AND HIGH CHANCE 
SOUTHERN HALF TONIGHT. BY SATURDAY EXPECT FAR NORTH AND NORTHWEST 
AREAS TO BE DRY...BUT WILL CARRY LOW POPS ELSEWHERE FOR THE 
MORNING...AND ALL DAY SOUTH AND SOUTHEAST.  HAVE NO ARGUMENTS WITH 
MAV TEMPS.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DRY PERIOD EXPECTED 
THROUGH THE LATTER PORTION OF THE UPCOMING WEEKEND BEFORE UPPER FLOW 
TRANSITIONS FROM A NEARLY ZONAL FLOW TO A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW EARLY 
NEXT WORK WEEK IN ADVANCE OF AN APPROACHING SHORT WAVE THROUGH. THIS 
FLOW TRANSITION WILL PROMOTE BETTER MOISTURE FLOW INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. HAVE CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS 
THROUGH MUCH OF THE UPCOMING WORK WEEK WITH THE ANTICIPATION THAT 
PRECIP WILL BE MAINLY DIURNAL IN NATURE. UPPER RIDGE BECOMES 
RE-ESTABLISHED OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION BY LATE IN THE 
LONG TERM RESULTING IN A REDUCTION OF PRECIP CHANCES. FOR TEMPS... 
WHICH ARE PROJECTED TO GENERALLY REMAIN ABOVE CLIMO THROUGH THE LONG 
TERM...DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE FOR THE MOST PART.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK SURFACE RIDGING REMAINS 
ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING. SURFACE TROF WILL CONTINUE EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS AND WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY MOVES SE THROUGH THE OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY TODAY. UPPER LOW OVER THE OUTER BANKS WILL SLOWLY FILL 
AND MOVE NORTH THROUGH THE PERIOD. UPPER RIDGE SUPPRESSES SOUTH 
TODAY WITH DEFORMATION ZONE SETTING UP BRIEFLY OVER NORTHERN AREA 
THIS AFTN/EVE. PRECIPITABLE WATERS WILL APPROACH 2.00 LATER TODAY AS 
MOISTURE INCREASES IN WESTERLY FLOW IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING FRONT. 
SHEAR...LAPSE RATES AND LIFT VERY MINIMAL. AIRMASS SHOULD 
DESTABILIZE NICELY BY THIS AFTN. THE LACK OF TRIGGERS REMAINS THE 
FLY IN THE OINTMENT PERTAINING TO TIMING AND EXTENT OF CONVECTION 
TODAY AND TONIGHT. OLD BOUNDARIES AND OROGRAPHIC LIFT ALONG THE 
PLATEAU SHOULD SEE THE BEST CHANCE FOR CONVECTIVE INITIATION. BEYOND 
THAT. WEAK STEERING FLOW MAY KEEP DECENT CHANCE GOING ALONG LOW 
LEVEL BOUNDARY THROUGH TONIGHT FOR MOST AREAS...ESPECIALLY NE. MOS 
TEMP GUIDANCE DOWN CONSIDERABLY DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND QUICK FALL IN 
LOW LEVEL THICKNESS VALUES THIS AFTN. WILL LEAN ABOVE MOS NUMBERS IN 
THIS DRY AIRMASS. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...FOR SATURDAY...WEAK COLD 
FRONT WILL MOVE SOUTH OUT OF THE FORECAST AREA IN THE MORNING. WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS FOR THE EASTERN COUNTIES...THEN SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
AFTERNOON STORMS. MOST LOCATIONS WILL REMAIN DRY.

FOR SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT...UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL WITH 
WEAK SURFACE RIDGING. WILL CONTINUE DRY FORECAST WITH MORE SEASONAL 
TEMPERATURES.

FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY RETURNS. 
GFS AND ECMWF SHOW A SHORT-WAVE MOVING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY...BUT 
TIMING OF SYSTEM DIFFERENT. WILL CALL FOR A RETURN OF MAINLY DIURNAL 
CONVECTION WITH MAIN FORCING BEING TERRAIN. 

FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY...UPPER RIDGING STRENGTHENS SO DIURNAL 
CONVECTION WILL LESSEN...BUT WILL MAINTAIN SLIGHT POPS FOR THE 
VALLEY AND CHANCE FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.

.DISCUSSION...MID ATLANTIC LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CONTINUES TO DRIFT 
WESTWARD TOWARD COASTAL NC THIS EVENING...WITH A WEAK SURFACE TROUGH 
AXIS DEVELOPING ACROSS WESTERN NC. THIS SURFACE TROUGH HAS HELPED TO 
DEVELOP SOME ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED TSRA LATE THIS AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING...BUT MAINLY A FEW COUNTIES EAST OF OUR FORECAST AREA.
AN ISOLATED SHOWER DID BRIEFLY FIRE UP JUST EAST OF CLAY COUNTY NC.
THIS ACTIVITY HAS BEEN WEAKENING OVERALL WITH A SLOW DRIFT SOUTH...
SO NOT REALLY A FACTOR FOR OUR FORECAST OVERNIGHT.

OTHER CONVECTION IS WELL TO OUR WEST NEAR I-65 IN MIDDLE TN NORTH 
INTO CENTRAL KY ALSO ALONG I-65. COVERAGE INCREASES W OF THIS AREA 
CLOSER TO THE COLD FRONT.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...EXCESSIVE HEAT WILL BE THE STORY 
OF THE DAY ONCE AGAIN WITH RIDGING HOLDING ON ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE CENTRAL U.S. UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED 
COOL FRONT WILL SLOWLY APPROACH THE MID SOUTH LATER TODAY AND 
TONIGHT BUT NOT SOON ENOUGH TO BRING ANY REASONABLE CHANCE FOR RAIN. 
LATE TONIGHT THERE MAY BE A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM ON THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. HOWEVER...A MUCH 
BETTER CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE IN PLACE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS THE 
UPPER TROF PROGRESSES THROUGH THE EASTERN U.S. STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO 
MOS GUIDANCE WHICH FEATURES HIGH TEMPERATURES AROUND 10 DEGREES 
ABOVE NORMAL.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A WELCOME CHANGE TO THE HOT 
AND DRY PATTERN WILL FINALLY ARRIVE ON FRIDAY. AN UPPER TROUGH AND 
SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH FROM THE NORTHWEST...WHICH SHOULD 
BRING SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO MOST OF THE AREA FRIDAY AFTERNOON 
AND FRIDAY NIGHT. ALTHOUGH THE MOISTURE FEED AHEAD OF THE FRONT IS 
NOT IMPRESSIVE WITH THE RIDGE SUPPRESSED TO OUR SOUTH...THERE IS 
DECENT LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH THE UPPER JET STREAK AND THE AMPLIFYING 
MIDLEVEL TROUGH. MODELS CONTINUE TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT...SO 
CONFIDENCE IS HIGH ENOUGH TO RAISE POPS TO LIKELY EVERYWHERE FRIDAY 
NIGHT. THE PASSAGE OF THE COLD FRONT OCCURS SATURDAY MORNING WITH A 
DRY NORTHWEST FLOW FOLLOWING...THOUGH ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
PASSES BY DURING THE DAY. WILL HAVE JUST A SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POP 
ON SATURDAY.

A WEAK RIDGE AND A NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT WILL PROVIDE A DRY DAY ON 
SUNDAY. ON MONDAY THE BERMUDA HIGH BECOMES MORE DOMINANT WHILE A 
TROUGH TRACKS ACROSS THE MIDWEST...PROVIDING A SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW OF 
MOISTURE FOR OUR AREA. MAINLY DIURNAL SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS ARE 
EXPECTED FOR MONDAY...WITH THE POTENTIAL FOR MORE ORGANIZED PRECIP 
TUESDAY WITH THE APPROACH OF THE UPPER TROUGH. HOWEVER THE MODELS 
DIVERGE IN THEIR SOLUTIONS DURING THIS TIME FRAME...SO CONFIDENCE IS 
LOW. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION CHANCE POPS AND SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURES MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

ALLOWED DEW POINT TEMPS TO TUMBLE INTO THE MID 50S TO LOWER 60S THIS

CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT NORTH TO NEAR CALM WINDS THIS EVENING...SO

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...UPPER RIDGE WILL CONTINUE 
OVER THE AREA FOR THE SHORT TERM.  WITH LIMITED MOISTURE...SHOULD 
REMAIN DRY WITH A MOSTLY CLEAR TO CLEAR SKY.  ANOTHER HOT AFTERNOON 
IN STORE FOR THURSDAY...BUT WITH RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES EXPECTED 
TO REMAIN ON THE LOW SIDE...HEAT INDEX VALUES SHOULD STAY BELOW HEAT 
ADVISORY CRITERIA.  JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS...WHICH LOOK 
REASONABLE OVERALL.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AT THE START OF 
THIS PERIOD THE UPPER RIDGE IS STILL OVER THE AREA...ALTHOUGH THE 
LOW OFF THE CAROLINA COAST HAS STARTED TO EAT AWAY AT THE EASTERN 
PARTS OF THE RIDGE AND A TROUGH IS WORKING ITS WAY THROUGH THE 
PLAINS THAT LIMITS THE WESTWARD EXTENT OF THE RIDGE.  BY SATURDAY 
MORNING THE PLAINS TROUGH HAS MOVED EAST AND HAS PRETTY WELL PUSHED 
THE RIDGE SOUTHWARD...OUT OF THE AREA.  A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL PUSH 
THROUGH THE AREA AS WELL WITH THIS TROUGH.  IT WILL BE APPROACHING 
ON FRIDAY...EXPECTED TO SLIDE THROUGH ON SATURDAY...AND BE JUST 
SOUTH OF THE AREA BY SUNDAY.  GOING WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR 
SUNDAY...ALTHOUGH MODELS DON'T REALLY DRY OUT THE AIR MASS THAT 
MUCH.  BY MONDAY THE RETURN FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE SURFACE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MASSIVE RIDGE WILL REMAIN ACROSS 
THE EASTERN THIRD OF THE COUNTRY WITH LIMITED MOISTURE. SUBSIDENCE 
AND NEARLY FULL SUNSHINE SHOULD PUSH HIGH TEMPERATURES ACROSS MUCH 
OF THE REGION INTO THE MID AND UPPER 90S TODAY. ANOTHER MILD NIGHT 
IS IN STORE WITH LOWS NEAR 70 EXCEPT ACROSS PARTS OF NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AS WELL AS HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS 
INCLUDING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH 
CAROLINA. IN THESE AREAS MINS WILL BE A FEW TO SEVERAL DEGREES 
COOLER.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...ONE MORE HOT AND DRY DAY IS 
EXPECTED THURSDAY BEFORE A CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PATTERN BRINGS SOME 
RELIEF ON FRIDAY. THE MIDLEVEL RIDGE WILL BE DRIFTING SOUTHWARD 
ACROSS THE AREA ON THURSDAY...WITH HIGH TEMPS REACHING THE MID TO 
UPPER 90S IN MOST SPOTS THURSDAY. RECORD HIGH TEMPS AT THE BIG THREE 
SITES ARE ALL OVER 100...SO IT SEEMS UNLIKELY THAT THEY WILL BE 
BROKEN. THE RIDGE BREAKS DOWN ON FRIDAY AS A CLOSED LOW OFF THE 
ATLANTIC COAST BEGINS TO MERGE WITH A TROUGH APPROACHING FROM THE 
NORTHWEST. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON THE TIMING OF PRECIP 
ASSOCIATED WITH A COLD FRONT ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT...WILL RAISE 
POPS TO A HIGH CHANCE THESE PERIODS. 

MODELS INDICATE THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL HAVE ENOUGH PUSH TO BRING A 
COOLER AIR MASS INTO THE AREA OVER THE WEEKEND. LOW LEVEL RIDGING 
WILL CROSS THE AREA ON SUNDAY...THEN SHIFT TO OUR EAST BY MONDAY. A 
MOST SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW SHOULD SUPPLY ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR 
DIURNAL SCATTERED TO ISOLATED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY...WITH TEMPERATURES NEAR TO SLIGHTLY ABOVE NORMAL.

.FORECAST ON TRACK. NO UPDATE PLANNED. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...RIDGING SURFACE ALOFT WILL 
CONTINUE PRODUCING DRY AND HOT CONDITIONS. MAIN CONCERN IS DROUGHT 
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. DUE TO THE DRY GROUND...HAVE 
LOWERED AFTERNOON MOS DEWPOINTS ABOUT 3-5 DEGREES FOR WEDNESDAY. 
WENT CLOSE TO GFS MOS TEMPERATURES.

LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...NO CHANGE TO THE 
PATTERN FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY...AS UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES 
TO DOMINATE THE REGION...SO SLIGHTLY HOTTER FOR THURSDAY. ADJUSTED 
AFTERNOON DEW POINT TEMPS DOWN FOR THURSDAY AS GOOD MIXING IS 
EXPECTED...AND LOWERED DEW POINTS AGAIN SLIGHTLY ON FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON. 

PATTERN STARTS TO CHANGE BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THE WEEKEND.
THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IN THE CENTRAL ATLANTIC WILL BE DRIFTING 
WESTWARD TO JUST OFF COASTAL CAROLINAS...WHILE AN UPPER LEVEL TROUGH 
OF LOW PRESSURE MOVES EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES REGION FRIDAY. 
THIS TROUGH WILL CAUSE ANY REMNANTS OF THE UPPER LOW TO LIFT QUICKLY 
NE OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AN ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT WILL 
APPROACH OUR REGION BY SATURDAY MORNING...BUT LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
ADVECTION REALLY SEEMS TO BE LACKING IN ADVANCE OF THE FRONT...AS 
GULF MOISTURE LOOKS CUT OFF UNTIL THE MIDDLE TO NEXT WEEK. THUS...
I HESITATED TO INCREASE POPS JUST YET...ALTHO SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS 
WERE MADE FOR FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT TO STAY IN 
TOLERANCE WITH NEIGHBORING NWS OFFICES. 

NET RESULT OF THESE CHANGES WILL CERTAINLY BE TO WEAKEN THE STRONG 
UPPER RIDGE...A LITTLE MORE CLOUDINESS...AND SOME ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED TSRA. 06/00Z GFSX MOS MAXES FOR THE WEEKEND INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK REFLECTED COOLER TEMPS...WITH 12Z MOS TRENDING UP MAXES A 
FEW DEGREES. 

AFTER THE WEAK FRONTAL PASSAGE...I PREFERRED THE DRIER LOOK OF THE 
ECMWF MODEL...SO KEPT POPS AT MINIMAL VALUES (BELOW GFSX MOS) FOR 
SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY. TEMPS SHOULD CREEP BACK UP INTO THE 80S TO 
AT LEAST LOWER 90S BY TUESDAY...IF ECMWF IS INDEED CORRECT IN 
BUILDING BACK THE UPPER RIDGE.

A STRONG RIDGE WILL REMAIN IN CONTROL OF THE WEATHER ACROSS THE 
REGION THROUGH THURSDAY. THE VERTICALLY STACKED RIDGE WILL BE 
CENTERED OVER VIRGINIA TODAY...AND MAKE A SLOW WESTWARD DRIFT 
THROUGH THURSDAY. THIS WILL RESULT IN A CONTINUED WARMING 
TREND...WITH UPPER 90S LIKELY IN THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN TN VALLEY 
BY THURSDAY. THE RIDGE DOES BEGIN TO GET PINCHED OFF BETWEEN A 
DEEPENING TROUGH OVER THE PLAINS AND A RETROGRADING LOW OFF THE 
CAROLINA COAST...BUT SUBSIDENCE AND A LACK OF MOISTURE WILL MEAN OUR 
HOT DRY SPELL WILL PERSIST THROUGH THURSDAY. 

EXPECT THAT A RECORD HIGH WILL BE SET TODAY AT TRI...AS THE RECORD 
IS ONLY 93...SET IN 1993. TEMPS WILL APPROACH RECORD HIGHS FOR THE 
NEXT THREE DAYS AT TYS AND CHA BUT APPEAR TO BE SAFE BY A COUPLE

THE YEAR WILL NEED TO BE OVERCOME BY SOME DECENT MOISTURE ADVECTION 
OR RAIN CHANCES DON'T LOOK THAT PROMISING. 

AFTER THIS WEAK SYSTEM...THE GFS CONTINUES A THREAT OF CONVECTION 
FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...WHICH I WOULD QUESTION AT THIS POINT. I 
PREFER THE DRIER LOOK OF THE ECMWF...BUT OFFICES TO MY WEST AND 
SOUTH ARE TRENDING TOWARD THE WETTER GFS SOLUTION. THUS...CONTINUED 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS SUNDAY AND ALSO FOR WRN AND SRN FRINGES ON MONDAY.

I DID LOWER MAX TEMPS SLIGHTLY FOR THE WEEKEND INTO MONDAY IN LINE 
WITH LATEST GFSX MOS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE 
EASTERN GREAT LAKES REGION...WITH A WEAK TROUGH LOCATED GENERALLY 
ALONG THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. NAM MODEL INDICATES THAT THIS 
SURFACE TROUGH MAY HELP TO TRIGGER A FEW ISOLATED SHOWERS THIS 
EVENING ACROSS SOUTHWEST NC AND THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS...SO WILL 
CONTINUE TO MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THESE AREAS. OTHERWISE... 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO GENERATE DRY AND TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT...AS MODEL SOUNDINGS 
REVEAL A MID-LEVEL CAPPING INVERSION AND VERY DRY AIR WHICH SHOULD 
INHIBIT ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES THROUGH THE PERIOD...BUT WILL GENERALLY 
FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE FORECAST WITH TEMPS RISING A FEW DEGREES HIGHER 
EACH DAY AND NIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...STRONG HIGH PRESSURE ANCHORED 
OVER THE REGION WILL KEEP US DRY AND HOT FOR MUCH OF THE LONG TERM. 
MODELS DIVERGE AROUND THE THURSDAY/FRIDAY TIME FRAME WITH A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY APPROACHING THE AREA. FOR NOW...WILL CONTINUE WITH 
PERSISTENCE AND THE DRY ECMWF MODEL...WILL NOT MENTION PRECIP AT

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED QUASI- 
STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER THE DEEP SOUTH...WITH HIGH PRESSURE 
CENTERED OVER THE GREAT LAKES REGION. IN ADDITION...A WEAK SURFACE 
TROUGH WAS LOCATED ALONG THE APPALACHIAN MOUNTAINS...WHICH MAY HELP

THAT SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION MAY BE ABLE TO PUNCH THROUGH THIS CAP 
ALONG THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HUGE CENTRAL NORTH AMERICAN RIDGE 
TO WEST IS KEEPING ALEX MOISTURE WEST AND SOUTH OF US. UPPER TROF 
OVER EASTERN NOAM IS DIGGING SOUTH INTO DEEP SOUTHEASTERN US. 
SURFACE STREAMLINES COMING FROM NORTHEASTERN SURFACE HIGH, GIVING US 
A DRY NORTHEAS FLOW. SOME ORTHOGRAPHIC SHOWERS EARLIER OVER THE 
EXTREME SOUTHERN NC MOUNTAINS HAVE MOVED ON AND DISSIPATED. THIS 
SITUATION WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE SHORT TERM PERIOD...OVERNIGHT. 
EXPECT SOME SOLAR POWERED CU LATE THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON. MAY 
PERSIST UNTIL AROUND SUNSET. WILL NOT RULE A STRAY, VERY LIGHT 
SHOWER, OR EVEN VIRGA OVER THE CENTRAL (HIGHEST) MOUNTAINS ALONG THE 
NC LINE SO HAVE ADDED A 6-12% POP THERE BUT IS NOT MENTIONED IN 
ZONES. SOME THIN GAUZY CIRRUS OR ALTOSTRATUS/ALTOCU MAY FORM OR WAFT 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND SO HAVE DROPPED MAX TEMPS A DEGREE, 
AND RAISED THE A DEGREE TONIGHT. MORE DEWPOINTS WILL BEGIN A SLOW 
RISE TONIGHT AS SURFACE HIGH DRIFT EAST AND STREAMLINES MOVE OUT 
SLIGHTLY OVER ATLANTIC, BRINGING MORE MOIST AIR INTO REGION.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE ACROSS THE
REGION PROVIDING DRY WEATHER FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. A FRONT
APPROACHES THE REGION BY THURSDAY. WITH STILL UNCERTAINTY ON
TIMING...WILL GO WITH PERSISTENCE AND KEEP THURSDAY DRY FOR NOW.

THE FORECAST AREA AS PER 05Z SURFACE ANALYSIS. BOUNDARY ANALYZED
TO BE EXTENDING WEST TO EAST FROM SOUTH OF MSL TO JUST NORTH OF
CULLMAN ALABAMA...THEN TO AROUND RMG AND THEN ACROSS NORTH GEORGIA.
LATEST IR SATELLITE IMAGE AT 06Z CONTINUES TO SHOW NORTH END OF
MID-HIGH CLOUD BAND STILL ACROSS NORTH ALABAMA...AND SLOWLY
TRENDING SLIGHTLY SOUTHWARD. WILL CONTINUE WITH MOSTLY SUNNY
FORECAST ACROSS THE AREA TODAY...AND HAVE EVEN TRENDED DOWNWARD THE
CLOUD CONDITIONS IN GRIDS FOR TODAY. 

TEMPS LOOK GENERALLY GOOD AS PER GOING FORECAST AND WILL CONTINUE
WITH BASIC FORECAST TRENDS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...VERY STRONG UPPER RIDGE
STILL LOOKS TO DOMINATE OUR REGION INTO EARLY NEXT WEEK. SURFACE
RIDGE LOCATION WILL NOT ALLOW ANY RETURN OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE
UNTIL WEDNESDAY OR LATER. 

GFS AND ITS ENSEMBLE BREAK UPPER RIDGE DOWN BY LATE NEXT WEEK...
AS A TROUGH MOVES ACROSS GREAT LAKES REGION WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO
THURSDAY. HOWEVER...ECMWF SHOWS UPPER RIDGE HOLDING STRONG...
SO KEPT OUR DRY FORECAST INTACT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT. PROLONGED
PERIOD OF LITTLE WIDESPREAD RAIN HAS RESULTED IN A DRY BOUNDARY
LAYER...WHICH WILL AID IN MAX TEMPS RUNNING A FEW DEGREES ABOVE
CLIMO FOR THE EXTENDED PERIOD. MINS WILL START OUT COOLER THAN
SEASONAL NORMALS THAN RISE TO CLIMO BY MID NEXT WEEK.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
SETTLE SOUTHEAST INTO THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH TONIGHT. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS AND SURFACE ANALYSIS EARLY THIS MORNING INDICATE THAT 
UPPER 50S TO AROUND 60 DEGREE DEWPOINTS ARE SLOWLY ADVECTING 
SOUTHEAST INTO WESTERN KENTUCKY AS OF 05Z. LATEST 05Z SURFACE 
ANALYSIS INDICATES THAT FRONTAL BOUNDARY HAS MOVED SOUTH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AND INTO NORTH ALABAMA AND NORTH GEORGIA. 

WITH BOUNDARY IN VICINITY OF THE SOUTHERN PORTION OF THE FORECAST
AREA TODAY...WILL STILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR
SOUTHERN BORDER COUNTIES. TEMPS LOOK GOOD FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT
AND GENERALLY ACCEPTED.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...REMNANTS OF HURRICANE ALEX 
TO REMAIN OUT OF OUR WEATHER PICTURE...WHILE A STRONG UPPER RIDGE OF 
HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS FROM THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY TO THE OHIO AND TN 
VALLEY REGIONS. A DRY AIRMASS WILL ALLOW FOR AN INCREASING DIURNAL 
RANGE FROM MIN TO MAX TEMPS...WITH PLEASANT OVERNIGHT LOWS AND HIGHS 
NEAR OR JUST A FEW DEGREES ABOVE SEASONAL VALUES. 

PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS RIGHT ON TRACK WITH JUST SOME VERY MINOR 
TEMP ADJUSTMENTS LATE IN THE PERIOD...GENERALLY NUDGING HIGHS UP A 
BIT TO STAY ABOVE CLIMO NEXT WEEK AND CLOSER TO NEARBY NWS GRIDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...COLD FRONT IS MOVING SOUTH
ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST COUNTIES THIS AFTERNOON. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS
HAVE DEVELOPED ACROSS CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES. DRIER AIR WITH
DEWPOINTS IN THE UPPER 50S TO MIDDLE 60S ARE MOVING INTO THE
FORECAST AREA. WILL MAINTAIN LOW POPS FOR THE FAR SOUTHERN AREAS
FOR EARLY THIS EVENING...OTHERWISE DRY.

WINDS WILL BECOME CALM TONIGHT WITH ONLY HIGHS CS OVERHEAD...SO THERE
MAY BE PATCHY-AREAS OF FOG...ESPECIALLY NEAR AREA LAKES.

FOR WEDNESDAY...FRONT BECOMES NEARLY STATIONARY ACROSS NORTHERN 
ALABAMA-NORTHERN GEORGIA. WILL MAINTAIN LOW CHANCE POPS FOR THE FAR 
SOUTHERN COUNTIES...OTHERWISE DRY AND WARM.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...AT THE START OF
THIS PERIOD THE NORTHEASTERN TROUGH IS STILL IN THE PICTURE...BUT
THE UPPER HIGH IS BUILDING INTO THE AREA FROM THE NW AND BY FRIDAY
THE RIDGE IS DEFINITELY IN CONTROL. THE RIDGE LOOKS TO HOLD ON
THROUGH THE WEEKEND...THEN START TO WEAKEN EARLY NEXT WEEK.

THINK THE FORECAST LOOKS DRY FOR THE MOST PART THROUGH THESE 6 
DAYS. ON THE FRONT END...WED EVE...THINK THAT RAIN THREAT WILL BE
MAINLY SOUTH OF AREA...AND ON THE BACK END OF THE FORECAST...EARLY
NEXT WEEK...MOISTURE RETURN IS EXPECTED TO BE FAIRLY LIMITED AS
FLOW COMES MORE OFF OF THE ATLANTIC THAN THE GULF. WILL HAVE SOME
LIGHT POPS/SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN EAST AND SW ON MONDAY AND
TUESDAY...OTHERWISE WILL KEEP IT DRY.

HAVE GONE VERY CLOSE TO MOS TEMPS THROUGHOUT.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...EVENING CONVECTION HAS
DISSIPATED OR MOVED EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. SURFACE
ANALYSIS WOULD SUGGEST THE WEAK COLD FRONT (OR PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH)
MAY STRETCH FROM OUR NRN PLATEAU COUNTIES INTO WESTERN MOST
COUNTIES OF SWRN VA. HOWEVER...BETTER AIRMASS DIFFERENCE BASED ON
DEW POINT TEMPS IS NOTED OVER THE WESTERN THIRD OF KY NE INTO SW
OHIO...WHERE THE ACTUAL COLD FRONT MAY STILL BE LOCATED. 850 MB
ANALYSIS FROM 29/00Z PLOTS SUPPORTS THIS POSITION. 

CONSIDERING FRONTAL POSITION...AND DAYTIME HEATING...HAD TO KEEP
POPS ABOVE MOS VALUES...CLOSE TO PREVIOUS GRIDS. WON'T RULE OUT AN
ISOLATED STRONG TO MARGINALLY SEVERE STORM THIS AFTERNOON. GFS MOS
MAX TEMPS LOOKED GOOD AND WERE CLOSELY FOLLOWED.

FOR TONIGHT...GFS MODEL/MOS DRIES AIRMASS OUT MORE THAN NAM-WRF
...AND I TRENDED TOWARD A BLEND WHICH KEEPS MIN TEMPS MOSTLY IN THE
60S TO LOWER 70S. MAY ALSO SEE SOME PATCHY AREAS OF FOG...PER NAM
MOS. PREVIOUS POP/WEATHER GRIDS LOOKED GOOD WITH LOW EVENING POPS
ACROSS SRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS DIFFER INITIALLY
WITH SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF FRONTAL BOUNDARY...WITH GFS MODEL
KEEPING MORE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE AND HIGHER POPS ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA COMPARED TO THE NAM MODEL. WILL GO SOMEWHAT WITH A SPLIT OF
BOTH MODELS FOR SOUTHERN COUNTIES...AS BELIEVE THAT CHANCE POPS
ALONG TENNESSEE BORDER COUNTIES TO GEORGIA AND SOUTHWEST NORTH
CAROLINA WILL NEED TO HAVE AT LEAST 30 POPS FOR WEDNESDAY. WILL
ALSO INTRODUCE SMALL AREA OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS JUST TO NORTH OF 30
POP AREA. 

AFTER WEDNESDAY...UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA IN
AMPLIFIED PATTERN BY THURSDAY...WITH MODELS CONTINUING IN KEEPING
RIDGE OVER THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST
PERIOD. WILL SLOWLY RAISE TEMPS UPWARD AS RIDGE MOVES OVER THE AREA
BY THE LATTER PART OF THE WEEKEND. MODELS HINT TO A SLIGHT WEAKNESS
IN THE RIDGE PATTERN BY MONDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT
CHANCE AFTERNOON PRECIP CHANCES FOR AREA.

DIFFERENCES EXIST IN HANDLING REMNANTS OF TROPICAL STORM ALEX.  06Z

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
437 AM EDT MON JUN 28 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION 
CONTINUES OVER THE SRN OHIO VALLEY REGION THIS MORNING...WITH
SOME SIGNS OF WEAKENING AS IT DROPS SE. CLOUDS ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
CONVECTION MAY OVERSPREAD SW VA AND NE TN WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
SUFFICIENT FOR THE REST OF THE EARLY TO MID MORNING HOURS. PREVIOUS 
FORECAST GRIDS GENERALLY WERE ON TRACK WITH SOME SLIGHT ADJUSTMENTS
...MAINLY TO INCREASE POPS ACROSS SW VA AND ALSO TO LOWER POPS 
ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC EARLY TODAY. 

A PERSISTENT MAX TEMP FORECAST HAS BEEN GOOD LATELY...BUT AN EARLY 
START TO CONVECTION TODAY MAKES COOLER MAX TEMPS A BETTER CHOICE 
ACROSS NRN AREAS. FRONTAL BOUNDARY SAGS SLOWLY SOUTH...SO BETTER 
RAIN CHANCES MAY SHIFT SOUTHWARD BY THIS EVENING. HOWEVER...HARD TO 
TIME THE SLOW PUSH OF THE FRONT SOUTHWARD AND INTERACTION WITH 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES...SO KEPT THE PREVIOUS TREND OF LOWERING TO 
CHANCE POPS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. A BLEND OF 
SIMILAR MOS MINS LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT AND WAS CONSISTENT.

FORECAST AREA NOT OUTLOOKED FOR SLIGHT CHANCE OF SEVERE DUE TO WEAK 
FLOW ALOFT...BUT THE MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS MAY SUPPORT A FEW 
PULSE TYPE SEVERE STORMS. DOWNBURST GUSTY WINDS AND LOCALLY HEAVY 
RAINS THE MAIN THREATS.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO PASS
THROUGH FORECAST AREA TUESDAY WITH CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS AHEAD OF THE FRONT. BEST CHANCES SOUTH. TEMPERATURES
ONLY SLIGHTLY COOLER THAN TODAY. DRIER AIR MASS WITH SURFACE HIGH
MOVING SOUTH INTO OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY AND THEN TUESDAY NIGHT AND
WEDNESDAY. COLD FRONT WILL GET HUNG UP ALONG TN AND GA BORDER AS
MOISTURE MOVES NORTHEAST AHEAD OF TROPICAL STORM ALEX AS IT MOVES
INTO THE MEXICAN AND SOUTH TEXAS COAST. NAM MODEL KEEPS MOISTURE
SOUTH OF FORECAST AREA BUT GFS BRINGS MOISTURE TO CHA AND SW NC
AREA. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS EXTREME SOUTH. DROPPED HIGHS
A FEW DEGREES AS NEW MODELS TRENDING HIGHS SLIGHTLY LOWER WEDNESDAY. 
AS UPPER TROUGH SETTLES OVER EAST COAST AND SURFACE HIGH SHIFTS SOUTH
FROM THE GREAT LAKES TO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. 
HIGHS WILL STAY MOSTLY IN THE 80S WITH LOWS IN THE UPPER 50S AND
60S. SATURDAY AND SUNDAY TROUGH SHIFTS OFF THE EAST COAST AND UPPER
RIDGE MOVES EAST FROM THE CENTRAL STATES. THIS WILL BRING A SLOW
WARMING TREND INTO THE TN VALLEY. MOISTURE FROM ALEX MAY BEGIN TO
MOVE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY LATE SUNDAY OR MONDAY OF NEXT WEEK.

AGREEMENT WITH ADJACENT NWS SITES GRIDS...WHICH SHOWS NO BREAK IN 
CONVECTION OVERNIGHT. THIS LEADS INTO HIGH CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS 
EARLY MONDAY AS COLD FRONT DRAWS NEAR.

PRE-DAWN TEMPS RUNNING VERY MILD...SO I OPTED FOR CLOSER TO

PLANNED. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCE NOTED IN 
DEW POINT TEMPS FROM SOUTH (LOW 70S) TO NORTH (LOW 60S) THIS 
MORNING...WITH 26/00Z RNK SOUNDING SHOWING A SIGNIFICANT DRYING 
TREND. 26/00Z OHX SOUNDING STILL QUITE MOIST WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER 
AROUND 1.75 INCHES. CONVECTION YESTERDAY WAS QUITE LIMITED TO MOSTLY 
SRN PLATEAU AND EXTREME SE TN INTO SW NC. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS 
LOOKED ON TRACK FOR TODAY...KEEPING CONVECTION ISOLATED AND CONFINED 
TO SIMILAR AREAS FROM FRIDAY (MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN). IT SHOULD BE 
DIFFICULT FOR ANY STORM TO MAINTAIN ANY INTENSITY THIS AFTERNOON. 
OPTED TO KEEP MAX TEMPS CLOSER TO PERSISTENCE.

FOR TONIGHT...KEPT SOME EVENING POPS FOR SAME AREAS AS AFTERNOON 
POP/WEATHER GRIDS. OTHERWISE...CLEAR TO PARTLY CLOUDY AFTER ANY 
CONVECTIVE DEBRIS CLOUDS DISSIPATE. MINS TEMPS FALL A LITTLE CLOSER 
TO CLIMO OVER NRN AREAS...BUT STILL A BIT MILDER THAN CLIMO ACROSS 
SE TN AND SW NC AREAS. A BLEND OF MOS MINS LOOKED BETTER OVERALL.

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MOIST AND WARM UNSTABLE 
AIRMASS WILL LIE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS SOUTH AND A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH. UPPER TROUGH 
DEVELOPING OVER THE GREAT LAKES SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY WILL FORCE A 
COLD FRONT INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. THIS FRONT WILL MOVE SLOWLY SOUTH 
AND EAST INTO THE TN VALLEY MONDAY AND TUESDAY. EXPECTING AN 
INCREASE IN SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. 
ISOLATED STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS ARE POSSIBLE AHEAD AND ALONG THE

CONVECTION WILL END WITH LOSS OF HEATING. MOST CONVECTION WILL BE 
ACROSS HIGHER ELEVATIONS EXPECT ALONG OLD BOUNDARY ACROSS SW VA.
MIN TEMPS HAVE BEEN INCHING UP LATELY SO CONTINUED THAT TREND FOR 
TONIGHT ALONG WITH MOS #S. BOTTOM OF EAST MOVING UPPER TROF MOVES 
ACROSS SW VA THU. FRONTAL BOUNDARY APPROACHES FROM THE N. POPS WILL 
GO UP THROUGH THU AFTN. SOME STORMS COULD BE STRONG. FCST HIGH SIDE 
OF MAX TEMP GUIDANCE COUNTING ON CLOUDS AND PCPN ARRIVING IN THE 
AFTERNOON.  

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MAIN STORY FOR THE 
LONG TERM IS POTENTIAL MAJOR PATTERN SHIFT WHICH HAS VIRTUALLY 
UNANIMOUS SUPPORT FROM MEDIUM RANGE MODELS AND ENSEMBLES. UPPER FLOW 
PROJECTED TO BECOME MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED BY EARLY NEXT WEEK WITH 
AMPLIFYING TROUGH DEVELOPING OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. MAIN MODEL 
DIFFERENCES REVOLVE AROUND TIMING WITH GFS STILL ABOUT 24 HOURS 
QUICKER WITH PASSAGE OF COLD FRONT THAN ECMWF. AS A RESULT...HAVE 
MADE ONLY MINOR TWEAKS TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST. IN THE 
MEANTIME...LITTLE CHANGE IN CURRENT PERSISTENT PATTERN AS UPPER 
RIDING HOLDS STRONG OVER THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS.

CLIMO...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV GUIDANCE. APPEARS 
HEAT INDEX VALUES WILL APPROACH...BUT NOT QUITE MEET...HEAT ADVISORY 
CRITERIA. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH WILL REMAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE NATION THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. AS A RESULT...EXPECT 
A FAIRLY STAGNANT PATTERN WITH HOT AND HUMID CONDITIONS LINGERING 
THROUGH EARLY NEXT WEEK. A WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO SLOWLY 
SETTLE INTO THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY FRIDAY...AND THEN BECOME QUASI- 
STATIONARY THROUGH THE WEEKEND. WHILE THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL NOT 
PROVIDE MUCH TEMP RELIEF...IT WILL INCREASE THE CLOUD COVER AND 
AREAL COVERAGE OF CONVECTION DURING THE PERIOD...WHICH SHOULD RESULT 
IN A SLIGHT DECREASE OF A FEW DEGREES IN AFTERNOON MAXES. GFS AND 
ECMWF MODELS AGREE THAT ANOTHER STRONGER COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH 
THE FORECAST AREA ON MONDAY...WITH AN UNSEASONABLY STRONG UPPER- 
LEVEL TROUGH PUSHING IT ACROSS THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION. AS A 
RESULT...IT APPEARS THAT THIS NEXT COLD FRONT MAY ACTUALLY BRING 
COOLER TEMPS CLOSER TO NORMAL. WITH A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
DEVELOPING EACH DAY THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD OVER THE REGION... 
THINK THAT AT LEAST ISOLATED CONVECTION WILL BE POSSIBLE EACH DAY... 
ALONG WITH THE POSSIBILITY OF MORE-ORGANIZED MCS ACTIVITY FROM THE 
OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON A FEW DAYS. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL FOLLOW A 
PERSISTENCE PATTERN THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT WITH A SLIGHT 
DECREASING TREND WITH MAXES DUE TO THE EXPECTED INCREASE IN 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT BY THE WEEKEND.

TO THE NORTH MAY MANAGE TO PUSH ANOTHER OUTFLOW BOUNDARY INTO OUR 
FAR NORTHERN ZONES THIS AFTERNOON...SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR SW VA THIS AFTERNOON/EARLY EVENING...AND WILL INCLUDE OUR

CONVECTION INTO THE NE SECTIONS BY LATE AFTERNOON SO HAVE SLIGHT TO 
CHANCE POPS THAT AREA THROUGH 00Z. CLOUD COVER SHOULD BE MINIMAL 
EXCEPT NE SECTIONS THROUGH MID EVENING AS STORMS DISSIPATE.  LOWS 
TONIGHT STILL FAIRLY COMFORTABLE IN THE 60S TO NEAR 70. TUESDAY

UPPER TROF WILL HAVE MIGRATED EAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES ON ITS WAY

BOUNDARY TO DROP SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THEREFORE 
MAINTAINED A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
THURSDAY THROUGH FRIDAY AS THE BOUNDARY PROVIDES A FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTION WHILE PRESSING VERY SLOWLY SOUTH. THIS FRONT WEAKENS AND 
LOSES ITS IDENTITY OVER THE WEEKEND AS UPPER LEVEL RIDGING 
RE-ESTABLISHES ITSELF ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. A FAIR AMOUNT OF

OVER HIGHER TERRAIN IN THE EASTERN AREAS...WHICH MESHED BETTER WITH

THROUGH TUESDAY AND PROBABLY WEDNESDAY. THE BEST CHANCE OF 
CONVECTION STILL LOOKS LIKE THE HIGHER TERRAIN. THURSDAY THE UPPER

.AVIATION...CUMULUS CLOUDS HAVE BEEN SUPPRESSED THIS AFTERNOON...
WITH SPC MESOSCALE PAGE SHOWING CAPPING INVERSION HOLDING STRONG
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. NO ORGANIZED LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE NOTED
SO ANY CONVECTION SHOULD BE VERY ISOLATED. THUS...NO MENTION OF VCTS 
OR CB REMARK FOR ANY TAF SITE THIS PACKAGE. 

FOR TONIGHT...BASED ON EXPECTATION OF LITTLE TO NO SHOWERS/STORMS 
TODAY...THEN BOUNDARY LAYER SHOULD BE DRIER OVERNIGHT. FOR THIS 
REASON...WENT WITH JUST MINIMAL FOG AND A SCATTERED LOW LAYER LATE 
TONIGHT FOR TRI AND TYS. MAINLY VFR CONDITIONS ON TAP.

.DISCUSSION...AREAS OF LOW CLOUDS AND PATCHY FOG PERSIST ACROSS MANY 
VALLEY LOCATIONS THIS MORNING...BUT EXPECT MUCH IMPROVEMENT OVER THE 
NEXT HOUR OR SO. 12Z OHX AND RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW THE EFFECTS OF 
RIDGING ALOFT...AS WARMER AIR HAS CREATED A FAIRLY STRONG CAPPING 
INVERSION. STILL SOME NEGATIVE CAPE (BUOYANCY) TO OVERCOME IF 80S TO 
LOW/MID 90S ARE REACHED IN THE AFTERNOON...BUT THE CAP COULD BE 
BROKEN IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS IN THE HEAT OF THE DAY. 

THUS...SLIGHT CHANCE POPS LOOK GOOD FOR HIGH TERRAIN AREAS...WHILE 
ELSEWHERE A DRY FORECAST WILL BE MAINTAINED...AS ANY ONGOING 
CONVECTION IS WELL UPSTREAM AND WEAKENING.   

WILL UPDATE THE ZFPMRX PRODUCT TO REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING...AND 
MONITOR HOURLY CONDITIONS AGAINST GRIDS FOR POSSIBLE UPDATE TO

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
858 AM EDT SAT JUN 19 2010

.DISCUSSION...
CONVECTOIN HAS DEVELOPED OVER MIDDLE TN EARLIER THAN EXPECTED DUE
TO AN APPROACHING SHORTWAVE TROUGH. THE MODELS ARE DOING A VERY
POOR JOB OF PICKING UP ON THIS CONVECTION. AN EARLY UPDATE WILL
NEED TO BE ISSUED TO RAISE POPS IN ALL LOCATIONS...BUT ESPECIALLY
IN THE PLATEAU. WILL BRING POPS UP TO LIKELY THERE. TEMPS WILL ALSO
BE ADJUSTED DOWNWARD ACCORDINGLY.

CONVECTIVE PARAMETERS FROM THE 12Z OHX SUGGEST A POTENTIAL FOR
SEVERE WEATHER TODAY. THE OHX SOUNDING MODIFIED TO 92/70 YIELDS AN
LI OF -6 AND CAPE VALUES AROUND 3000 J/KG. MODEL FORECAST SOUNDINGS
IN OUR AREA THIS AFTERNOON INDICATE SIMILAR NUMBERS. A WBZ HEIGHT
OF NEARLY 14KFT SHOULD MEAN A MINIMAL HAIL THREAT...BUT A SURFACE
TO MIDLEVEL THETA-E DIFFERENCE OF 35 C SUGGESTS DAMAGING DOWNBURTS
WILL BE THE MAIN CONCERN.

320 AM EDT SAT JUN 19 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK BOUNDARY THAT HAS BEEN OVER 
THE AREA HAS MOSTLY WASHED OUT.  MODELS SHOW SHORT WAVE MOVING 
ACROSS THE AREA TODAY. APPEARS THERE WILL BE SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND 
INSTABILITY FOR SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION...SO WILL CARRY SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS THIS AFTERNOON.  EXPECT MOST OF THE CONVECTION TO BE 
GONE BY TONIGHT...SO OTHER THAN SLIGHT CHANCE EARLY IN SOME OF THE 
TERRAIN AREAS SOUTHERN HALF...WILL GO DRY.  WILL MAKE SOME MINOR 
TWEAKS TO MAV TEMPS...MAINLY TO BUMP HIGHS DOWN SLIGHTLY FOR 
TODAY.     

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SHORT WAVE ENERGY WILL SHIFT 
EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER WELL NORTH OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION EARLY IN THE FORECAST PERIOD. AT THE SAME TIME HIGH PRESSURE 
WILL STRENGTHEN ALOFT OVER MUCH OF THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE NATION. 
IN THIS REGIME THE CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL REMAIN SLIGHT AND WILL BE 
MAINLY LIMITED TO THE HIGHER CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND APPALACHIAN 
TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. BY THURSDAY THE RIDGE IS 
EXPECTED TO RETROGRADE WHILE AN UPPER LEVEL TROF SHIFTS INTO THE 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. THIS MAY ALLOW A COOL FRONT TO MAKE ITS WAY SOUTH 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA. UNCERTAINTY ABOUT JUST HOW FAR SOUTH THIS 
FRONT MAY PROGRESS WILL REQUIRE USE OF A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR NOW. 
IF THIS SCENARIO LOOKS MORE REALISTIC IN FUTURE MODEL RUNS POPS WILL 
BE TWEAKED UPWARD. KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE AREA WIDE POPS GOING INTO 
FRIDAY WITH SYNOPTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY HANGING AROUND THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. WENT CLOSE TO IF NOT A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW SUGGESTED 
MEX MOS MAXES WHILE TRENDING VERY CLOSE TO MINS.

A DIFFUSE FRONT APPEARS TO BE LOCATED APPROXIMATELY FROM KNOXVILLE

CAPPED AS THE 12Z RNK AND ILN SOUNDINGS SHOW A STRONG INVERSION
STARTING AROUND 800 MB. MORNING SHOWERS ASSOCIATED WTIH THE
REMNANTS OF A DECAYING MCS ARE LOCATED IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY
WILL EXIT THE AREA SHORTLY...BUT WEAK INSTABILITY SOUTH OF THE
FRONT ALONG WITH ANY BOUNDARIES FROM THE MORNING SHOWERS SHOULD BE
ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A FEW ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON.

THE CURRENT FORECAST OF ISOLATED SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS IN THE
SOUTHERN VALLEY LOOKS GOOD. WILL UPDATE TO REMOVE THE MENTION OF

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY STILL OVER 
THE AREA...BUT APPEARS WHAT IS LEFT OF THIS FRONT WILL FINALLY SLIP 
TO OUR SOUTH ALLOWING DRIER AIR TO PUSH INTO EVEN SOUTHERN COUNTIES 
TODAY.  COULD BE SOME ISOLATED WEAK CONVECTION SOUTHERN HALF EARLY 
TODAY...AND CANNOT RULE OUT SOME CONVECTION SOUTHERN PLATEAU AREA 
THIS AFTERNOON...BUT PROBABILITIES LOOK LOW ENOUGH TO STAY WITH 
CURRENT PRECIP FREE FORECAST AND JUST CARRY A SILENT BELOW 15 POP.  
OTHERWISE...EXPECT THE SKY TO BE MOSTLY CLEAR FOR THE MOST PART.  
MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO JUST SOME MINOR TWEAKS.    

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...COULD NOT FIND ANY SOLID 
EVIDENCE THROUGH THE PERIOD TO UTILIZE BETTER THAN A SLIGHT CHANCE 
POP FOR CONVECTION AS THE MODELS INDICATE SHORT WAVE PASSAGE ACROSS 
THE GREAT LAKES AND NORTHEASTERN U.S. EARLY IN THE PERIOD WITH AN 
UPPER LEVEL RIDGE STRENGTHENING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH THROUGH TIME. 
UNCERTAINTY EXISTS LATE IN THE PERIOD ON THURSDAY WITH RIDGE 
POSSIBLY RETROGRADING WHILE ANOTHER SHORT WAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST 
ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. BASICALLY TRIED TO TRIM THE SLIGHT 
CHANCE POPS THROUGHOUT MOST OF THE LONG TERM LIMITING THUNDER 
CHANCES TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN FEATURES. STAYED SOMEWHAT CLOSE TO MEX

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...A LATE AFTERNOON/EVENING PERIOD

TONIGHT. BUT THE STORMS SHOULD LOSE THEIR INTENSITY WITH THE LACK OF 
HEATING. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP AFTER 06 IN SOUTHERN 
COUNTIES TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS. 

A BUILDING MIDLEVEL RIDGE SHOULD SUPPRESS ANY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT 
TOMORROW...AND THE SURFACE FRONT ACROSS THE AREA SHOULD CONTINUE ITS 
SOUTHWARD PUSH...THUS BRINGING A DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR MASS TO 
THE ENTIRE AREA. TEMPS WILL STILL BE VERY WARM...IN THE UPPER 80S TO 
LOWER 90S OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS.

LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...DRIER AIRMASS WILL

A FRONT APPEARS TO BE LOCATED NEAR A LINE FROM EVV TO BWG TO TRI AS
DEPICTED BY GOES SOUNDER PW AND MESOANALYSIS OF LI. TO THE NORTH OF
THE FRONT...DEWPOINTS ARE IN THE LOWER TO MID 60S...AND THE 12Z RNK
AND ILN SOUNDINGS SHOW A STRONG INVERSION BETWEEN 800-700 MB. THE
RUC AND LOCAL WRF MODELS INDICATE A SLIGHT SOUTHWARD MOVEMENT OF
THE FRONT TODAY. CONVECTION CURRENTLY IN SOUTH CENTRAL KY/NORTHERN
MIDDLE TN IS PROJECTED TO TRACK JUST SOUTH OF THE FRONT...AND REACH
OUR SOUTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES AROUND 18Z. WITH THE FRONT POSITIONED
ACROSS THE NORTHERN PORTION OF OUR AREA...THERE SHOULD BE
SUFFICIENT INSTABILITY IN OUR CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN COUNTIES TO KEEP
THESE STORMS GOING AS THEY MOVE INTO THE TN VALLEY. SO THE UPDATE
WILL RAISE POPS TO A CHANCE IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN
PLATEAU...WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE POP ADDED TO THE NORTHERN PLATEAU
AND CENTRAL TN VALLEY. OBSERVED TEMPERATURES ARE RUNNING A BIT
ABOVE FORECAST...BUT INCREASING CLOUD COVER THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD
RESULT IN HIGH TEMPS CLOSE TO THE CURRENT FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR INDICATING ISOLATED SHOWERS 
AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE CWA ALONG A FRONTAL BOUNDARY. THE ACTIVITY 
SHOULD WEAKEN THIS MORNING. WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE 
SOUTHERN AREAS FOR TODAY WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE LINGERS. THE 
HIGHEST INSTABILITY SHOULD ALSO BE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AREAS FOR 
TODAY. SO THE BEST CHANCE FOR STRONG TO SEVERE STORMS WILL BE IN 
THAT AREA OF THE CWA THIS AFTERNOON.  DRY WEATHER RETURNS TONIGHT.   
ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED AGAIN TODAY AND TONIGHT. STAYED 
NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL HIGH WILL BUILD OVER THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY 
ON FRIDAY...AND THEN SLOWLY RETROGRADE TOWARDS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
DURING THE WEEKEND. AT THE SURFACE...SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR IS PROGGED 
TO SETTLE INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY BEHIND THE PASSAGE OF A 
WEAK COLD FRONT. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A MID-LEVEL CAPPING 
INVERSION DEVELOPING OVER THE REGION ON FRIDAY...WHICH SHOULD 
SUPPRESS CONVECTION OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...WILL 
KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP OVER THE MOUNTAINS...WHERE THE GFS MODEL 
INDICATES SOME CONVECTION MAY BE ABLE TO BREAK THROUGH THIS CAP. 
ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA ON 
SUNDAY...BUT SHOULD BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY NORTH OF THE FORECAST 
AREA. WITH NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW AND THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
STALLED-OUT NEAR THE FORECAST AREA...THINK THAT SOME POSSIBLE MCS 
DEVELOPMENT OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY MAY MOVE TOWARDS THE FORECAST 
AREA ON SUNDAY OR MONDAY. LATEST GFS MODEL RUN HINTS AT THIS 
SCENARIO...BUT SINCE THE DEVELOPMENT AND EXACT LOCATIONS OF MCS 
SYSTEMS CAN BE HIGHLY VARIABLE...WILL CONTINUE WITH ONLY A MENTION 
OF SLIGHT CHANCE POPS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD. AS FOR TEMPS...

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...
CONVECTION IS BEGINNING TO DEVELOP ALONG THE CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...AND WILL BE TRACKING INTO THE VALLEY THROUGH THE

HELP BREAK THE CAP AND INITIATE NEW CONVECTION. FORECAST CAPE VALUES

STORMS TO PRODUCE STRONG WIND GUSTS AND SOME HAIL. SEVERE THREAT 
SHOULD BE MORE ISOLATED THAN YESTERDAY THOUGH. THE LACK OF LARGE 
SCALE LIFT SHOULD RESULT IN ANY STORMS DISSIPATING WITH SUNSET...SO 
WILL REMOVE ALL POPS FROM THE FORECAST AFTER MIDNIGHT.

THIS RIDGE. SO CHANCES OF PRECIP LOOK MUCH LOWER 
TOMORROW...ESPECIALLY NORTH. WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE 
SOUTHERN COUNTIES WHERE DEWPOINTS WILL BE HIGH SOUTH OF THE FRONT. 
HIGHS WILL BE IN THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S AGAIN...BUT SHOULD FEEL 
MORE PLEASANT WITH LOWER HUMIDITY.

LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AN UPPER RIDGE 
WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. AIRMASS WILL BE 
DRIER WITH PWS BETWEEN 1.25 AND 1.5 FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY. ALSO...A 
WEAK MID-LEVEL CAP WILL BE IN PLACE LIMITING AFTERNOON CAPES TO 1000

1021 AM EDT WED JUN 16 2010

.DISCUSSION...
A WARM AND MOIST AIR MASS REMAINS IN PLACE OVER THE TN VALLEY AND
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION TODAY. AS HAS BEEN THE CASE OVER THE
PAST SEVERAL DAYS...DIURNAL CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP IN THIS
UNSTABLE AIR MASS...BUT WILL REMAIN UNORGANIZED WITH LITTLE UPPER
LEVEL FORCING. STORMS WILL LIKELY DEVELOP ALONG THE CUMBERLAND
PLATEAU WHERE THE LOCAL MESOSCALE MODEL SHOWS A CONVERGENCE ZONE
AND A THETA-E RIDGE. PULSE STORMS WILL TRACK SLOWLY EAST WITH
MIDLEVEL WINDS FROM THE WEST AROUND 15-20 KTS...AIDED BY CONVECTIVE
INITIATION FROM OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES. MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING
PRODUCES MUCAPE VALUES AROUND 2800 J/KG...AND AN LI OF -7. SO HAIL
AND DAMAGING WINDS WILL AGAIN BE POSSIBLE WITH THE STRONGEST
STORMS. BACK-BUILDING STORMS ALONG OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES WILL MEAN A
LOCALIZED FLOOD THREAT. THE CURRENT FORECAST OF LIKELY POPS WITH
HIGH TEMPS IN THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S LOOKS GOOD. WILL JUST UPDATE
THE ZFP TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING.

.AVIATION...SHORTWAVE UPSTREAM BRINGING AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS BUT IT 
SHOULD BE VFR AT CHA WHILE TYS IS EXPERIENCING IFR CONDITIONS AND 
TRI WILL HAVE MVFR CONDITIONS EARLY IN THE TAF PERIOD. VFR 
CONDITIONS SHOULD RETURN IN THE 13-15Z TIME FRAME. THE SHORTWAVE 
WILL TRACK THROUGH THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON BRINGING A RETURN OF 
THUNDERSTORMS TO ALL 3 SITES TODAY. WITH STILL UNCERTAINTY ON 
TIMING...WILL KEEP IT VFR FOR NOW. BUT THERE IS THE CHANCE THAT 
BELOW VFR CONDITIONS ALONG WITH STRONG GUSTY WINDS WILL OCCUR

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR INDICATING SHORTWAVE 
TRIGGERING SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS IN MIDDLE TN. THE DISTURBANCE IS 
PROGGED TO TRACK THROUGH THE REGION TODAY. WITH INCREASING MOISTURE 
AND INSTABILITY EXPECTED WITH IT...WILL GO WITH LIKELY POPS FOR THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS. COULD SEE A FEW SEVERE STORMS AGAIN BY AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING. DRIER WEATHER RETURNS TONIGHT. ABOVE NORMAL 
TEMPERATURE EXPECTED AGAIN TODAY AND TONIGHT BUT SHOULD BE WELL 
BELOW RECORD TEMPERATURES. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR 
TEMPERATURES.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THAT A WEAKENING COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON 
THURSDAY...BRINGING DRIER AIR INTO THE FORECAST AREA ALONG WITH AN 
END TO CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT. THIS SCENARIO SEEMS HARD TO BELIEVE 
GIVEN THE TIME OF YEAR...AND THE FACT THAT THERE DOES NOT APPEAR TO 
BE MUCH UPPER-LEVEL SUPPORT FOR THIS SCENARIO WITH ONLY WEAK 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A MID-LEVEL CAPPING 
INVERSION OVER THE REGION...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING OVER 
THE DEEP SOUTH. WHILE THESE FACTORS SHOULD INHIBIT CONVECTION OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA FOR THE NEXT SEVERAL DAYS...THINK IT IS PRUDENT TO 
KEEP AT LEAST A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR DIURNAL CONVECTION THROUGHOUT 
THE EXTENDED FORECAST. WILL PLAN TO LOWER DEWPOINTS SOME BY THURSDAY 
AND INTO THE WEEKEND...BUT WILL REMAIN A LITTLE HIGHER THAN GUIDANCE 
SINCE IT IS NOT ENTIRELY CONVINCING THAT DRIER AIR WILL WORK ITS WAY 
THIS FAR SOUTH. ANOTHER WEAK COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO APPROACH THE 
FORECAST AREA DURING THE WEEKEND...BUT THINK THAT THIS ONE WILL ALSO 
STALL OUT AND DISSIPATE NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS... 
WILL TREND CLOSE TO THE GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS (BUT ULTIMATELY A 
LITTLE HIGHER) THROUGH THE PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...VERY UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE HAS 
ERUPTED INTO POCKETS OF STRONG TO SEVERE CONVECTION WHICH APPEARS TO 
BE INITIATING ON THE MAJOR TERRAIN FEATURES AND DRIFTING VERY SLOWLY 
EAST. EXPECT THE ACTION TO CONTINUE POSSIBLY THROUGH THE MIDDLE PART 
OF THE EVENING BEFORE LOSING STRENGTH AS THE SURFACE SLOWLY COOLS. 
FOR THE PAST SEVERAL DAYS MODELS HAVE BEEN TARGETING THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION ON WEDNESDAY AS 
NORTH CENTRAL STATES UPPER TROF DRIVES EAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES 
AND OHIO VALLEY. MIDWEST FRONTAL BOUNDARY SHOULD CONTINUE TO PRESS 
SOUTH AND EAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY TOWARD THE NORTHERN REACHES 
OF THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY. EXPECT FAIRLY DECENT CONVERAGE OF 
STORMS ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS WELL AS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WELL IN ADVANCE OF THIS COOL FRONT. 
THEREFORE EDGED POPS TO LIKELY CATEGORY IN THIS AREA WHILE USING 
GOOD CHANCE ACROSS THE REMAINING COUNTIES. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO 
GUIDANCE BLEND FOR TEMPS IN THE SHORT TERM.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...FOR THURSDAY...WEAK 
FRONT WILL MOVE TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA MAINTAINING A CHANCE OF 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS. 

FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...MODELS SHOW A WEAK SURFACE AND 850MB LOW 
DEVELOPING OVER GA WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH INTO THE SPINE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS. CONVERGENCE ALONG INVERTED TROUGH ALONG WITH UPSLOPE 
EAST FLOW INTO THE CAROLINA MOUNTAINS WILL KEEP BEST CHANCES- 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ALONG THE TENNESSEE-NORTH CAROLINA STATE- 
LINE. THE FLOW AROUND THE WEAK LOW WILL PRODUCE A DEEP...BUT 
WEAK...EASTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH DOWNSLOPE IN THE 
VALLEY. ALSO...MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW DRY AIRMASS AND WEAK MID-LEVEL 
CAP OVER THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.  BESIDES THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA...WILL CALL FOR MOSTLY DRY 
CONDITIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

FOR TUESDAY...DEEPER MOISTURE RETURNS IN ADVANCE OF ANOTHER WEAK 
BOUNDARY. CONFIDENCE OF THIS FRONT LOW...SO WILL ONLY CALL FOR LOW 
CHANCE POPS.

AT CHA AND TYS FOR NOW. ACTION QUIETS DOWN AGAIN TONIGHT WITH SOME
IFR/LIFR CONDITIONS DUE TO THE HIGH LOW LEVEL MOISTURE CONTENT WITH

..SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE MID WEST AND CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS...WITH A VERY MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. THE CENTRAL APPALACHIAN PORTION OF THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY MAY ACTUALLY DRIFT A LITTLE FURTHER SOUTH TODAY TOWARDS 
SOUTHWEST VA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TN...AND BECOME A FOCUSING 
MECHANISM FOR ADDITIONAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY IN THESE AREAS. MODELS 
AGREE THAT AT LEAST A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL DEVELOP 
ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE GFS MODEL 
REVEALING A LITTLE MORE 850 MB MOISTURE THAN THE NAM MODEL WHICH 
WOULD RESULT IN A STRONGLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS. THUS...WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION SCATTERED CONVECTION AREAWIDE WITH GOOD CHANCE POPS...AND 
THINK THAT SOME STORMS WILL AGAIN BECOME SEVERE THIS AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE 
FORECAST SINCE THE AIR MASS HAS NOT CHANGED MUCH SINCE YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SERIES OF SHORTWAVE TRACKING 
OVER THE RIDGE COMBINED WITH MODERATE DIURNAL INSTABILITY WILL BRING

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LARGE UPPER RIDGE STAYS IN PLACE. 
SERIES OF SHORT WAVES COME OVER THE TOP AD NAUSEUM. SEEMS LIKE THIS 
HAS BEEN GOING ON FOR MONTHS. EXTREMELY HIGH SFC RH AND MODERATE 
INSTABILITY GIVE FUEL TO THE MIX. TRIGGER SEEMS TO WARMTH HITTING 
CONVECIVE TEMPS. GIVEN THAT NEAREST SFC FRONT FOR FOCUS IS WELL TO 
THE NORTH NEAR THE GREAT LAKES, EXPECT THAT AFTER SUNSET CONVECTION 
SHOULD DROP OFF GRADUALLY. NAM12 SOUNDINGS DON'T SHOW MUCH IN THE 
WAY OF MINIMAL DEWPOINT DEPRESSIONS AND AM EXPECTING SOME RESIDUAL 
CLOUDINESS OVERNIGHT. WILL NOT ADD FOG TO WEATHER OVERNIGHT, AS IT 
WILL BE PATCHY AT BEST, OCCURRING MAINLY AREAS WHICH RECEIVE HEAVY 
RAINFALL TODAY AND TONIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...A SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE 
ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES AND THE NORTHEAST THROUGH WEDNESDAY. THIS 
WAVE WILL PROVIDE ENOUGH EMPHASIS TO MOVE A WEAK BOUNDARY INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA WEDNESDAY-WEDNESDAY NIGHT. A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE REGION FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WITH 
DRIER AIR. WILL CONTINUE WITH ONLY SLIGHT POPS FOR MAINLY THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN. SURFACE RIDING WILL PULL EAST FOR SATURDAY THROUGH 
MONDAY WITH RETURN OF DEEPER MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY. FORCING 
WILL STILL BE LIMITED TO THE TERRAIN FEATURES...SO SLIGHT POPS FOR 
THE VALLEY AND CHANCE FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

UPPER RIDING FOR FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY...WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES VERY

A LITTLE HIGHER AT THE END OF THE EXTENDED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY ACROSS THE MID WEST...WITH A VERY 
MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX OVER SOUTHEAST KY...WHICH WAS MOVING SOUTHEAST 
TOWARDS SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. THUS...WILL MENTION SCATTERED 
CONVECTION THROUGHOUT THE DAY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT A MODERATELY UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS WILL AGAIN DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON...WITH THE HIGHEST 
INSTABILITY LOCATED OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
THUS...WILL MENTION CHANCE POPS EVERYWHERE...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS 
OVER SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
TREND TOWARDS A PERSISTENCE FORECAST SINCE THE AIR MASS HAS NOT 
CHANGED MUCH SINCE YESTERDAY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...BASIC PATTERN FOR THIS 
PERIOD IS RELATIVELY CONSISTENT WITH RIDGING IN THE SOUTHERN U.S. 
AND A MORE PROGRESSIVE PATTERN TO THE NORTH. UPPER RIDGE OVER OUR 
AREA IS EXPECTED TO WEAKEN SLIGHTLY THEN TRY TO BUILD BACK IN FROM 
THE WEST IN LATER PERIODS.  

ON WEDNESDAY MODELS AGREE ON A WEAK FRONTAL PASSAGE...OR MAYBE MORE 
CORRECT TO SAY TROUGH PASSAGE. MODELS HAVE SEEMED OVERLY AGRESSIVE 
LATELY ON FRONTAL PASSAGES AND DRYING OUT THE AIR MASS. THINK IT IS 
WISE TO WILL KEEP DEW POINT READINGS HIGHER THAN GUIDANCE. FOR 
EXAMPLE THE GFS AT 18Z ON THURSDAY HAS THE DEW POINT AT KTYS OF 55 
DEG...WITH THE GFS MOS DEW POINT AT 60 BY 00Z. ALSO...LOOKING 
UPSTREAM THERE SHOULD BE LITTLE SOURCE OF DRY AIR. SO ANY DRYING 
WILL NEED TO BE DONE THROUGH SUBSIDENCE AND DEEP MIXING--WILL 
PROBABLY GET A FEW DEGREES OF DRYING BUT NOT 10-15 DEG DRIER. WITH 
THIS IN MIND...HAVE BUMPED UP THE POPS ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TO NOW 
MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS AT MOST LOCATIONS. LOW 
END POPS CONTINUE INTO THE WEEKEND.

FOR TEMPS...WENT PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE...EXCEPT 1-2 DEGREES 
COOLER ON MAX TEMP FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY DUE TO HIGHER MOISTURE 
LEVELS...LIKEWISE WENT WARMER ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY MIN TEMPS DUE 
TO HIGHER DEW POINTS.

SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. AREA RADARS REVEAL SCATTERED CONVECTION 
OVER SOUTHEAST KY MOVING SOUTHEAST TOWARDS KTRI...SO WILL MENTION A 
TEMPORARY GROUP OF TSTORMS WITH MVFR VISIBILITIES AT KTRI FOR A FEW 
HOURS EARLY THIS MORNING. EXPECT SOME FOG AT KTRI AROUND SUNRISE... 
BUT WILL ONLY MENTION IFR VISIBILITIES SINCE HIGH CLOUDS ASSOCIATED 
WITH CONVECTION OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY MAY PREVENT LOWER 
VISIBILITIES. SCATTERED TSTORMS ARE EXPECTED TO DEVELOP NEAR THE TAF 
SITES AGAIN TODAY...SO WILL INCLUDE VCTS AT ALL THREE TAF SITES IN

UPPER RIDGE HAS ALLOWED LESS ACTIVITY TO DEVELOP THAN YESTERDAY.
COMPLEXES OVER THE MID WEST ARE FARTHER NORTH OF THE OHIO RIVER
THAN LAST NIGHT. ONE SMALL AREA OF STORMS WEST OF LEX IS HEADED
TOWARD SW VA SO WILL LEAVE A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS
THE REST OF THE NIGHT AS UPPER FLOW IS SE. PATCHY FOG WILL BE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...CONVECTION CONTINUES TO 
MAINLY AFFECT SW VA AND NE TN THIS AFTERNOON...AIDED BY WEAK UPPER 
LEVEL TROUGH/VORTICITY CENTER APPARENTLY PASSING SE THROUGH THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. COVERAGE HAS DIMINISHED SLIGHTLY OVER THE PAST 
HOUR OR SO...WITH SCATTERED WORDING AND HIGHER CHANCE POPS GOOD FOR 
THOSE AREAS THIS EVENING. ELSEWHERE...LOOKS LIKE MAINLY ISOLATED 
DIURNAL CONVECTION...MUCH IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS. 
THE INTENSITY OF ANY STORMS HAS REMAINED VERY WEAK SO FAR. PATCHY 
FOG WAS MENTIONED AGAIN FOR LATE TONIGHT.

SHORT RANGE MODELS SUGGEST SLIGHTLY MORE TSRA OVER SW VA AREAS AGAIN 
MONDAY INTO MONDAY EVENING...ALTHO UPSTREAM CONVECTION SEEMS FURTHER 
NW TO ME THAN PAST FEW DAYS. THUS...NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH TO GO MORE 
THAN HIGH CHANCE POPS TOMORROW FOR SW VA. NO REAL AIRMASS DIFFERENCE 
AGAIN ON TUESDAY...SO BEST FORECAST IS TO CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS 
FOR NOW. 

FOR TEMPS...A FEW MORE LOCATIONS HITTING THE LOWER 90S TODAY...AND 
MIN TEMPS HAVE BEEN TRENDING MILDER AND MUGGY EACH NIGHT. LOWER 70S 
OR SO EACH NIGHT ACROSS SRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA LOOKS HARD TO 
BEAT. INCREASED MAX TEMPS JUST SLIGHTLY FOR MONDAY AND TUESDAY...BUT
STAYED A LITTLE BELOW THE HOTTER NUMBERS FOR NOW...SINCE AIRMASS IS 
SO MOIST. TRI HAS BEST CHANCE TO TIE OR SET A RECORD MAX MONDAY AND 
TUESDAY...AS RECORDS ARE 92 DEGREES EACH DAY. HOT AND MUGGY ENOUGH 
TO SEE HEAT INDEX MENTIONED FOR CHA ZONE GROUP...ALTHO NOT YET HIGH 
ENOUGH TO JUSTIFY A HEAT ADVISORY (105 DEGREES OR HIGHER FOR 2 DAYS
WITH A MIN TEMP OF 75 DEGREES OR HIGHER). 


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...STAYED CLOSER TO ECMWF 
DURING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST WHICH DEPICTS ANOTHER SHORTER 
WAVELENGTH TROF ROUNDING THE TOP OF THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. RIDGE. THE 
TROF CROSSES THE GREAT LAKES ON WEDNESDAY AND SUBSEQUENTLY SWINGS 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHEASTERN QUARTER OF THE NATION. THIS WILL 
MEAN ANOTHER SYNOPTIC FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL DROP SOUTH ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY. AREAL COVERAGE OF CONVECTION MAY BE A 
LITTLE GREATER IN THIS REGIME ON WEDNESDAY WITH SOME HELP FROM TAIL 
END OF NORTHEASTERN STATES VORT AXIS. KEPT THE POPS AT 40 PERCENT 
FOR THE EVENT. DEPARTURE OF THIS UPPER LEVEL FEATURE FOR FRIDAY AND 
A NICE STRENGTHENING UPPER LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE REGION WILL HELP 
LOWER THE CHANCE FOR SHOWER/THUNDERSTORM DEVELOPMENT THURSDAY 
THROUGH SATURDAY SO KEPT THE 10-20 PERCENT POP GOING FOR THIS 
PERIOD. PERHAPS ANOTHER SHORTWAVE WILL SHOVE ANOTHER SYNOPTIC COOL 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY TOWARD THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY 
SUNDAY SO USED THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP AT THIS RATHER REMOTE PERIOD OF 
THE FORECAST.

MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL AGAIN DEVELOP THIS AFTERNOON... 
WITH THE HIGHEST INSTABILITY LOCATED OVER THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE

YESTERDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LITTLE CHANGE FORESEEN IN

WHICH HAS BEEN ANCHORED OVER THE GULF COAST STATES...SHIFTS SLIGHTLY

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...SHORTWAVE TROUGH CONTINUES 
TO MOVE EAST INTO THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS AND ERN OHIO VALLEY THIS 
AFTERNOON...WITH BEST COVERAGE OF TSRA OVER SE KY AND SW VA. BREAKS 
OF SUNSHINE OCCURRING...ESPECIALLY OVER CENTRAL AND SRN VALLEY OF E 
TN WHERE TEMPS HAVE REACHED THE MID 80S TO LOWER 90S. SHOWER COOLED 
AREAS OF SW VA AND NE TN HOLDING IN THE 70S. AIRMASS DESTABILIZING 
WITH NEW RANDOM DEVELOPMENT ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. THINK 
THAT COVERAGE WILL BE ISOLATED TO WIDELY SCATTERED FROM LATE 
AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING...WHICH FITS WELL WITH CURRENT FORECAST 
GRIDS. HAVE SEEN A STORM OR TWO BRIEFLY PULSE UP...BUT NOTHING 
STRONG TO SEVERE JUST YET.

CARRIED SOME POPS OVERNIGHT AS SHORT RANGE MODELS SHOW MORE 
CONVECTION MOVING THROUGH THE UPPER RIDGE LATE TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY.
KEPT POPS JUST BELOW LIKELY FOR SUNDAY ACROSS SW VA AND NRN PLATEAU
...AND WILL DEFER TO MIDNIGHT SHIFT TO SEE IF HIGHER POPS WILL BE 
JUSTIFIED. OTHERWISE...FOR SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY...SHOULD SEE 
MORE MAINLY DIURNAL CONVECTION WITH A STORM OR TWO POSSIBLY BUILDING 
TO STRONG OR MINIMALLY SEVERE LEVELS. ENOUGH UNCERTAINTY TO STICK 
CLOSE TO PREVIOUS POP/WX GRIDS FOR NOW FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. 

FOR TEMPS...MIN TEMPS STARTING TO SHOW THE EFFECTS OF PERSISTENT 
UPPER RIDGE AND A MUGGY AIRMASS...SO 60S TO LOWER 70S PER MOS LOOKS 
GOOD. ALSO...STARTING TO BELIEVE LOWER 90S FOR MAX TEMPS...ACROSS 
THE SRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MOS OFFERS UP MID 90S FOR CHA 
BOTH DAYS...WHICH WON'T BE A RECORD MAX TEMP EITHER DAY. I KEPT SW 
VA AND NE TN CLOSER TO A GFS BLEND WITH THE COOLER NAM HIGHS. 

THE RECORD HIGHS FOR THE NEXT TWO DAYS ARE AS FOLLOWS:

SUNDAY (13TH)...CHA 99/1953...TYS 96/1958...TRI 94/1944...AND OQT 
95/1958.

MONDAY (14TH)...CHA 97/1914...TYS 96/1943...TRI 92/1943...AND OQT
95/1964.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...ECMWF EDGED A LITTLE 
CLOSER TO THE GFS IN THE MID WEEK TIMEFRAME AND BOTH MODELS ALLOW 
SOME PERIODIC SHORTWAVE ENERGY TO BUILD OVER THE TOP OF SOUTHEASTERN 
U.S. UPPER RIDGE WITH PERHAPS A LITTLE BETTER CHANCE FOR CONVECTION 
ON WEDNESDAY. THEREFORE KEPT CHANCE POPS GOING DURING THIS PERIOD 
WHILE CONTINUING THEME OF LATER WEEK SUPPRESSION OF THUNDERSTORM 
FORMATION WITH LIMITATION TO HIGHER TERRAIN THURSDAY AND FRIDAY AS 
UPPER RIDGE STRENGTHENS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST STATES. MODELS TRY TO 
BRING AN UPPER TROF THROUGH THE MIDWEST ON SATURDAY AND WITH 
POSSIBILITY OF INCREASING MOISTURE AND LESS STABILITY AHEAD OF THIS 
SYSTEM WENT AHEAD AND PLACED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR CONVECTION 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON DAY SEVEN. PULLED BACK JUST A BIT ON MEX

LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT 
A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL DRIFT NORTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO

.AVIATION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
STRETCHING FROM WEST VA SOUTHWARD INTO THE PIEDMONT REGION OF NC... 
WITH A VERY MOIST AIR MASS LINGERING OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER MIDDLE TN OCCURRING 
IN ASSOCIATION WITH A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. MODELS AGREE 
THAT THIS SHORT WAVE WILL DRIFT NORTHEAST INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY 
THIS MORNING...AND GENERALLY STAY NORTH OF THE TAF SITES TODAY. 
PATCHY FOG WILL BE THE MAIN PROBLEM IN THE SHORT TERM...BUT AN 
EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUD COVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY WILL LIKELY KEEP 
VISIBILITIES A LITTLE HIGHER THAN LAST NIGHT. THUS...WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION ONLY IFR VISIBILITIES AT KTRI AROUND SUNRISE...WITH NO FOG 
AT KTYS AND KCHA. SCATTERED CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO DEVELOP AGAIN 
DURING THE AFTERNOON HOURS NEAR ALL THREE TAF SITES...SO WILL 
INCLUDE A MENTION OF VCTS AT ALL TAF SITES UNTIL 00Z.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAIN AREA OF ONGOING
CONVECTION IS FROM CUMBERLAND PLATEAU JUST INTO WESTERN MOST PARTS
OF THE CENTRAL AND SRN VALLEY. THIS IS WHERE CAPPING INVERSION
BROKE THE EARLIEST AND ALSO DUE TO OROGRAPHIC FORCING. A COUPLE OF
STORMS HAVE PULSED UP BRIEFLY TO BE MINIMALLY SEVERE AT THIS TIME.
OPTED FOR A LATE AFTERNOON PERIOD TO THE ZFP PRODUCT TO CARRY
SCATTERED WORDING AND CHANCE POPS...THEN GENERALLY CARRIED SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS FOR MOST AREAS. KEPT SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN
OVERNIGHT TO MAINLY MESH WITH HIGHER POPS FROM JKL TO OUR NORTH.
NOT CERTAIN THAT THIS CONVECTION WILL LINGER ALL NIGHT...BUT
PARTIAL CLEARING AFTER CONVECTION SHOULD LEAD TO DEVELOPMENT OF
PATCHY DENSE FOG (AND LOW CLOUDS) BEFORE DAYBREAK. MOS BLEND FOR
MINS LOOKED SLIGHTLY BETTER THAN THE MILDEST CHOICES.

MOST UNSTABLE AIRMASS ON SATURDAY WILL BE WESTERN AND NORTHERN AREAS
WITH SHORT RANGE MODELS IN GOOD AGREEMENT ON A SHORTWAVE/VORT MAX TO 
MOVE THROUGH THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS. SURFACE TROUGH OR OUTFLOW 
BOUNDARIES FROM THIS MESOSCALE CONVECTION SHOULD HELP TO TRIGGER A 
LITTLE MORE WIDESPREAD CONVECTION ACROSS NRN PLATEAU AND SWRN VA 
AREAS...SO I INCREASED POPS FOR THOSE AREAS INTO LOWER END OF 
LIKELY. 

THINK THAT CONVECTION WILL BE MOST ACTIVE INTO SATURDAY EVENING...
BUT KEPT LOW POPS OVERNIGHT TO BE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND 
ADJACENT NWS OFFICES. MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIRMASS ON SUNDAY WITH 
SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED AGAIN BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. AIRMASS 
STILL SEEMS TOO MOIST TO WARRANT GOING MUCH INTO THE 90S FOR HIGHS...
SO STAYED ABOUT 1 TO 3 DEGREES BELOW MOS FOR BOTH SATURDAY AND 
SUNDAY HIGHS. MOS MIN TEMPS LOOKED VERY REASONABLE AND CLOSELY 
FOLLOWED. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...DIFFERENCES REMAIN 
BETWEEN GFS AND ECMWF. PREFERRED TO STAY CLOSER TO ECMWF VERSION 
LATE IN THE PERIOD. MODELS BRING UPPER TROF ACROSS EASTERN CANADA 
AND NORTHEASTERN U.S. MONDAY INTO TUESDAY DRIVING A WEAK FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY SOUTH THROUGH THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
SUPPOSE THIS COULD PROVIDE A LITTLE MORE OF A FOCUS FOR A SLIGHTLY 
HIGHER POP FOR CONVECTION ALONG WITH SOME UPPER SUPPORT FROM TROF 
EARLY IN THE PERIOD. TRIED TO TREND BACK A BIT ON POP WEDNESDAY 
THROUGH FRIDAY AS RIDGING BEGINS TO STRENGTHEN WITH LITTLE FOCUS FOR 
PRECIPITATION. EMPHASIZED THE SMALL POSSIBILITY OF A SHOWER OR 
THUNDERSTORM IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN DURING THIS PART OF THE FORECAST. 
FOR TEMPERATURES ADJUSTED BACK A DEGREE OR TWO OFF THE RATHER WARM 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS.

.DISCUSSION...AIRMASS MAY HAVE SLIGHTLY DRIED OVER NE PARTS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA WITH 12Z RNK SOUNDING NOW SHOWING JUST UNDER ONE INCH 
OF PRECIPITABLE WATER (PW)...WHILE LITTLE CHANGE WAS NOTED FROM OHX 
SOUNDING (PW OF NEAR 2 INCHES). TEMPS ALOFT DO NOT APPEAR TO BE THAT 
MUCH WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...SO CAP STRENGTH IS ABOUT THE SAME. 
MODERATE INSTABILITY AGAIN TODAY WITH MAX TEMPS IN THE 70S TO NEAR 
90 DEGREES...SO EXPECT RANDOM CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT SIMILAR TO 
THURSDAY. AN ISOLATED STRONG STORM OR TWO COULD PRODUCE GUSTY 
WINDS...MAINLY OVER WESTERN AND SRN AREAS...PER OHX SOUNDING 
PARAMETERS. LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN AS WELL...BUT EAST STORM MOVEMENT AT 
10 TO 15 MPH AND NO TRAINING OF CONVECTION SHOULD LIMIT THIS THREAT. 

MESOSCALE CONVECTION THIS MORNING OVER NRN AR AND SRN MO STILL SEEMS 
TO BE THE FEATURE THAT SHORT RANGE MODELS MOVE THROUGH THE UPPER 
RIDGE AXIS ON SATURDAY. THIS MAY WARRANT LIKELY POPS FOR SATURDAY 
ACROSS SW VA/NRN PLATEAU/NE TN...MORE ON THIS LATER.

OTHERWISE...AREAS OF LOW CLOUDINESS AND FOG ARE LIFTING/DISSIPATING 
THIS MORNING. WILL UPDATE ZFPMRX TO REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING...BUT

NORTHWEST-TO-SOUTHEAST ORIENTED WARM FRONT LOCATED ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VA AND NORTHEAST TN...WITH A VERY MOIST AIR MASS RESIDING OVER MOST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THIS WARM 
FRONT WILL SLOWLY DRIFT NORTHWARD TODAY...WITH A HOT AND HUMID DAY 
DEVELOPING OVER THE ENTIRE REGION. MODELS INDICATE THAT INSTABILITY 
WILL BE HIGHEST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON. HOWEVER...WITH THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY IN THE PROXIMITY OF 
SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN...THINK IT IS BEST TO KEEP POPS THE 
SAME ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE 
BUILDING NORTHWARD OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...WILL PLAN TO KEEP 
POPS BELOW 50 PERCENT. AS FOR TEMPS...NAM AND GFS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL PLAN TO 
TREND TOWARDS MAXES AND MINS BEING A FEW DEGREES WARMER THAN 
YESTERDAY. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...TYPICAL SUMMER REGIME IN

CONVECTION AS UPPER RIDGE CONTINUES TO DOMINATE THE SOUTHEASTERN

THROUGH MUCH LATER...AFTER THE END OF THE LONG TERM PERIOD IN FACT. 
THE GFS SOLUTION DOES NOT HAVE ANY STRONG SUPPORT FROM THE GEFS 
ENSEMBLES...THUS HAVE NOT MADE ANY MAJOR CHANGES TO PRECEDING 
GRIDS/FORECAST. HOWEVER... CONFIDENCE IS LOW AT THIS POINT AS MODELS 
ARE PROFOUNDLY OUT-OF-PHASE FOR THE LATTER PART OF THE LONG TERM.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...BASED ON SURFACE ANALYSIS 
AND USING SPC MESOSCALE PAGE TODAY...WOULD PLACE WEAK COLD FRONT 
STILL TO OUR NORTH. CLOUD COVER HAS PERSISTED AND LIMITED WARMING 
ACROSS NRN 1/3 TO 1/2 OF THE FORECAST AREA...WHILE SOME SUNSHINE HAS 
WARMED CHA AND RHP INTO THE LOWER TO MID 80S. AIRMASS STARTING TO 
DESTABILIZE (MIXED LAYER CAPES FROM SPC PAGE 1000 TO 2000 J/KG).
WIDELY SCATTERED CONVECTION DEVELOPING WITH GENERALLY NO FAVORED 
AREA AT THIS TIME...SO NUDGED LATE AFTERNOON AND EVENING POPS DOWN 
TO HIGH CHANCE (WITH AREAL QUALIFIER). LET POPS FALL TO SLIGHT 
CHANCE LATE WITH PATCHY AREAS OF FOG. THINK THAT GFS MOS IS CLEARING 
SKIES OUT A BIT TOO MUCH...WITH NAM MOS FAVORED FOR SKY COVER. 

OTHERWISE...AIRMASS REMAINS VERY MOIST (ABOVE NORMAL) INTO THE 
WEEKEND...SO AT LEAST DIURNAL CONVECTION EXPECTED. SHORT RANGE 
MODELS HINT AT A COUPLE OF WEAK SHORT WAVES TO RIDE UP AND OVER THE 
UPPER RIDGE. THIS SCENARIO IS BETTER DEPICTED TO OCCUR ON SATURDAY
...SO I INCREASED POPS UP TO LOW END OF LIKELY IN A FEW AREAS BY 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. OVERALL NO MAJOR CHANGES FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS 
WEATHER WISE. 

MOIST AIRMASS WOULD SEEM TO FAVOR MILDER MOS MINS AT NIGHT...AND 
ALSO FAVOR GOING BELOW LOWER TO MID 90S FOR MAX TEMPS EACH DAY. THUS
I TRENDED TOWARD A MOS BLEND FOR MINS...A MOS BLEND FOR FRI MAXES
AND COOLER GFS MAXES ON SATURDAY. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SHORT WAVE TROF RIDES 
OVER THE TOP OF SOUTHEASTERN U.S. RIDGE DURING THE FORECAST PERIOD 
SUPPRESSING THE PRESSURE PATTERN A LITTLE FARTHER SOUTHWARD. THIS 
ACTION SHOULD CAUSE A COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO DROP SOUTH THROUGH 
THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY INTO TUESDAY. MAINTAINED PREVIOUS PACKAGE 
SMALL THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE POPS FOR CONVECTION SATURDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY AS THE WEAK BOUNDARY SLIPS FARTHER SOUTH. TUESDAY 
INTO THURSDAY TRIED TO STAY WITH JUST SLIGHT CHANCE PROBABILITY WITH 
UPPER HEIGHTS BUILDING ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN STATES WHILE DIFFUSE 
BOUNDARY DROPS SOUTH OF TENNESSEE. STAYED CLOSE TO IF NOT JUST UNDER

TODAY AND SFC PRESSURE GRADIENT IS STILL WEAK AND DISORGANIZED OVER 
MOST OF THE AREA, WITH HIGH PRESSURE TO SOUTH AND WEAKLY 
ANTI-CYCLONIC FLOW CURVES OVER TOP. WINDS WILL BE A LITTLE STRONGER

ESPECIALLY WITH NEXT UPSTREAM FRONT FAR TO THE WEST OVER THE GREAT

70S FAR SOUTH. ALSO PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES BETWEEN 1.60 AND 1.8 
OR AROUND 160-180% OF NORMAL. "FORTUNATELY", THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD 
COVER SHOULD LIMIT SUNSHINE A BIT AND KEEP TEMPS FROM RISING TOO 
HIGH TOO FAST. THE NAM FCST SOUNDING FOR ALL THREE ASOS STATIONS 
INDICATES A NEARLY ISOTHERMAL COLUMN FOR LIMITED INSTABILITY. WOULD 
NOT RULE OUT HAVING TO ISSUE SOME SPS'S OR EVEN SOME SVR'S FOR LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING, MAINLY FOR GUSTY WINDS. SPEED OF 
MOVEMENT OF STORMS WILL BE ON THE ORDER OF 10-15 KNOTS SO LOCALIZED 
HEAVY RAINS ARE A DISTINCT POSSIBILITY. HAVE TAPERED POPS OFF FROM 
LIKELY SOUTH/CHANCE NORTH GRADUALLY STARTING AT 00Z UNTIL ABOUT 04Z, 
WHEN RESIDUAL DAY TIME WARMTH SHOULD LESSEN THE LIFT. DID KEEP 
CLOUDS IN OVERNIGHT AS I SEE NO REDUCTION IN RH. HOT AND HUMID, WARM 
OVERNIGHT. WELCOME TO SUMMER.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A DISSIPATING BOUNDARY
WILL BE LOCATED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY AND
SATURDAY WITH PLENTY OF VERY WARM...MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR ACROSS

FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...UPPER RIDGE WILL STRENGTHEN OVER THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...BUT AMOUNT MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY TO KEEP
AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTION GOING...ESPECIALLY OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN.

FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY...ANOTHER FRONT WILL APPROACH THE AREA
WITH UPPER RIDGE FLATTENING...SO CONTINUED CHANCE OF STORMS...AGAIN
WITH THE MAIN COVERAGE OVER THE HIGH ELEVATIONS.

A FEW STRONG TO SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ALMOST EACH
DAY DUE TO THE MODERATE INSTABILITY. MAIN CONCERN WILL BE DAMAGING

RADAR TRENDS AND THE LATEST RUC FORECASTS INDICATE THAT THE MOST
ACTIVE PORTION OF OUR AREA THIS EVENING WILL BE OUR SOUTHERN
COUNTIES. THE CURRENT FORECAST HAS HIGHEST POPS NORTH...SO AN
UPDATE WILL BE ISSUED TO BETTER REFLECT THE CURRENT
TRENDS...RAISING POPS SOUTH AND LOWERING NORTH. RUC INDICATES A
LOCAL CAPE MAXIMUM CENTERED OVER OUR SOUTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES
THROUGH 00Z...SO THE SEVERE THREAT WILL REMAIN FOR THAT AREA OVER

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...INITIAL BAND OF CONVECTION 
HAS MOVED EAST THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA...WITH ISOLATED TO 
SCATTERED RE-DEVELOPMENT NOTED OVER WESTERN PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA (AND ALSO OVER CENTRAL KY AND MIDDLE TN). ACTUAL COLD FRONT IS 
STILL WELL UPSTREAM...PROBABLY NOT AS FAR EAST AS FRONTAL PROG CHART 
FOR 18Z. OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES...SOME UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT...AND DAYTIME 
INSTABILITY SHOULD KEEP SCATTERED CONVECTION GOING WELL INTO THE 
EVENING HOURS. WEAK COLD FRONT PROGGED TO SAG SOUTH OVERNIGHT...SO 
NOT ABLE TO REMOVE POPS.

OTHERWISE...AIRMASS REMAINS MOIST AND UNSTABLE THROUGH THESE SHORT 
TERM PERIODS. ADJUSTED POP/WX GRIDS IN LINE WITH LATEST MOS POPS...
WITH AN ATTEMPT TO DETERMINE WHERE BOUNDARY MAY BE LOCATED EACH 
PERIOD. BIGGEST CHANGE TO FORECAST GRIDS WAS FOR THURSDAY...AS PRIOR 
POPS WERE QUITE MINIMAL. APPEARS TO BE TOO MUCH MOISTURE AROUND EACH 
DAY TO REACH THE LOWER 90S...SO STAYED CLOSE TO PREVIOUS MAX TEMP 
GRIDS. MIN TEMPS ALSO ADJUSTED UP SLIGHTLY...GIVEN THE FACT THAT WE 
DON'T GET A REAL AIRMASS CHANGE. 

RAINFALL SO FAR TODAY HAS NOT BEEN THAT HEAVY...SO WON'T MENTION 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS FOR TONIGHT. WILL NEED TO MONITOR STORMS REST OF 
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING...ESPECIALLY IF MAX TEMPS PUSH INTO THE 
MID OR UPPER 80S OVER THE NEXT 2 TO 3 HOURS. GUSTY WINDS PROBABLY
MAIN THREAT...IN LINE WITH LOCAL STORM REPORTS FROM NEIGHBORING
OFFICES. 


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TRACKS 
THROUGH THE AREA ON SATURDAY. WILL KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING FOR 
SATURDAY WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH WHERE THE DEEPEST 
MOISTURE LINGERS. ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON 
SUNDAY. WILL CONTINUE CHANCE POPS GOING FOR SUNDAY WITH THE HIGHEST 
CHANCES IN THE NORTH WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE.  A 
FRONT TRACKS ACROSS THE CWA ON MONDAY. WITH A DECENT MOISTURE

FORECAST AREA...WITH A FEW OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES ALREADY NOTED. AMOUNT 
OF MOISTURE IS IMPRESSIVE WITH OHX 12Z SOUNDING SHOWING JUST OVER 2 
INCHES OF PRECIPITABLE WATER. TREND SEEMS TO BE FOR AREAL COVERAGE 
TO HOLD STEADY WHILE INTENSITY (OTHER THAN LIGHTNING) DECREASES. 
UPDATED DAY ONE OUTLOOK HAS SPREAD SLIGHT RISK AREA INTO PARTS OF NC 
AND SC...ALTHO INITIAL CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY SHOULD STAY BELOW SEVERE.

DEEPER SHEAR AND MOISTURE CONVERGENCE SEEMS TO LIE JUST TO OUR NORTH 
INTO THE OHIO VALLEY REGION. A MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING REVEALED 
POSITIVE CAPE OF AT LEAST 1000 J/KG AND LIFTED INDEX OF -5 DEGREES
...IF WE REACH THE MID 80S LATER TODAY. LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS MAY BE 
AS MUCH OR MORE OF A THREAT THAN LARGE HAIL TODAY...WHILE DAMAGING 
WINDS COULD OCCUR WITH THE STRONGER STORMS.

FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK AFTER EARLY MORNING UPDATE WAS DONE. I WILL 
TWEAK SOME HOURLY GRIDS TO BETTER REFLECT OBSERVATIONS...AND MAY 
NUDGE POPS UP ABOUT 10 PERCENT MORE. MAX TEMP FORECAST MAY NEED A 
FEW TWEAKS AS WELL.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES ALONG THE 
EAST COAST AND SOUTHEAST STATES WITH LOW PRESSURE OVER THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS AND WESTERN GREAT LAKES. A COLD FRONT WAS LOCATED FROM 
NORTHERN ILLINOIS SOUTHWEST TOWARD THE TEXAS PANHANDLE. OVERNIGHT 
SKIES BECAME MOSTLY CLOUDY WITH MID AND HIGH LEVEL CLOUDINESS AS 
MOISTURE HAS INCREASED FROM THE SOUTHWEST. THUNDERSTORM COMPLEXES 
OVER THE CENTRAL STATES AND SPREADING ACROSS THE MID MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY AND LOWER OHIO VALLEY WERE NOW MOVING INTO THE LOWER 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AS WELL. SHOWERS WERE DEVELOPING ACROSS THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THE AIRMASS WAS MOSTLY 
STABLE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BUT SLIGHTLY UNSTABLE ACROSS MIDDLE 
TN AND CENTRAL KY. EXPECTING THE EARLY MORNING CONVECTION OVER 
WESTERN KY AND TN TO PUT OUT OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES ACROSS NORTHWESTERN
SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING AND EARLY AFTERNOON AND 
BE A FOCUS FOR ADDITIONAL DEVELOPMENT AS THE AIRMASS BECOMES MORE 
UNSTABLE. STRONGEST SHEAR TO THE NW OF FORECAST AREA PER SPC 
OUTLOOK. LATE AFTERNOON AND EARLY EVENING ACTIVITY SHOULD REACH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS POSSIBLY IN THE FORM OF ANOTHER MCS LIKE HAS 
BEEN SEEN THE LAST COUPLE DAYS TO THE NW. HEAVY RAINFALL ALSO A 
THREAT WITH PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES OF ALMOST 2.0 INCHES THIS 
AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING. PUT HEAVY RAINFALL MENTION IN NORTHERN 
ZONES AND SMOKY MOUNTAIN GROUP WHICH WILL CONTINUE INTO THE 
OVERNIGHT HOURS. CONSIDERABLE CLOUD COVER MAY HOLD TEMPERATURES DOWN 
A COUPLE DEGREES WITH EXTENSIVE CLOUDS SPREADING INTO FORECAST AREA 
THIS MORNING. THIS MAY TEMPER SEVERE THREAT AS WELL. GRADUALLY 
INCREASED POPS TO LIKELY MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA BY AFTERNOON. 
THEN TONIGHT THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY BARELY SINKS INTO THE CWA EARLY 
THURSDAY MORNING SO CONTINUE HIGH POPS FIRST HALF OF TONIGHT EASTERN 
SECTIONS BEFORE DROPPING TO CHANCE.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...LARGE, YET DIRTY, UPPER 
RIDGE, EXTENDS FROM THE GMEX NORTHWARD INTO SOUTHERN AND SOUTHEAST 
US. A SERIES OF RELATIVELY WEAK SHORT WAVES MOVE ACROSS THE TOP OF 
THE RIDGE. IN ADDITION, OLD OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES FROM CENTRAL US 
MCC/MCS WILL MOVE INTO THE REGION. TEMPS SHOULD BE HOT ENOUGH TO 
TRIGGER CONVECTION EACH DAY, AND SFC-H5 RH STAYS IN PLACE OVER AREA 
THROUGH THE PERIOD UNTIL THE END. HAVE THEREFORE RAISED POPS A TAD 
IN THE NEAR TERM AND LEFT THE REST LARGELY ALONE. ADJUSTED TEMPS A 
BIT TO ACCOUNT FOR COORDINATION WITH SURROUNDING AREAS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT)...AFTER A GENERALLY

TOMORROW AFTERNOON AS BOUNDARY APPROACHES THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION FROM THE NORTH. MOST OF CWA OUTLOOKED AS SLIGHT RISK OF 
SEVERE WEATHER FOR TOMORROW BY SPC. BOUNDARY HAS HAD HISTORY OF 
PRODUCING MCS ACTIVITY SO SEVERE WEATHER CERTAINLY CAN'T BE RULED 
OUT. BOUNDARY SINKS JUST SOUTH OF OUR CWA BY EARLY THURSDAY TAKING 
BULK OF PRECIP WITH IT. HAVE OPTED FOR LIKELY POPS FOR THE NORTHERN 
HALF OF THE CWA ON WEDNESDAY BEFORE TAPERING TO CHANCE WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...AT START OF THIS
PERIOD...WE FIND A LARGE UPPER RIDGE OVER THE GULF MEX THAT EXTENDS
NORTHWARD INTO OUR AREA WITH A WEAK UPPER SHORT WAVE TROUGH TRYING
TO PENETRATE THE WESTERN AND NWRN PORTIONS OF THE RIDGE. MODELS
AGREE THAT THIS SYSTEM WILL NOT BE A MAJOR PLAYER IN OUR AREA...DUE
TO EITHER WEAKENING OR HAVING THE HEART OF THE SYSTEM PASSING
MAINLY TO OUR NORTH FRIDAY-SATURDAY. AN OLD SURFACE FRONTAL
BOUNDARY WILL BE CLOSE TO THE AREA AS WELL ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY
THAT COULD SERVE AS A FOCUS FOR CONVECTION. RIGHT NOW IT LOOKS LIKE
THIS BOUNDARY WILL BE MAINLY TO OUR SOUTH ON THURSDAY AND
FRIDAY...SO I HAVE THE POP GRADIENTS ORIENTED WITH HIGHER CHANCES
SOUTH. AS THE UPPER TROF PASSES TO OUR NORTH ON SATURDAY AND
SUNDAY...THE POPS ARE HIGHER TO THE NORTH. THE BEST COVERAGE OF
POPS IS ON MONDAY WITH THE ESTIMATED FRONTAL PASSAGE CENTERED ON
THAT TIME PERIOD...PER FAVORED ECMWF. THIS SYSTEM LOOKS TO BE
FAIRLY AGGRESSIVE FOR SO LATE IN THE SEASON. AFTER THE FROPA THE
FORECAST IS DRY FOR TUESDAY AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN.

STORMS POSSIBLE WEDNESDAY AND POSSIBLY THURSDAY WITH THE MAIN CONCERN
BEING DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS AND HEAVY RAINS CAUSING LOCALIZED 
FLASH FLOODING. FOR FRIDAY THROUGH THE END OF THE EXTENDED UPPER AND 
SURFACE RIDGING CONTINUES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. A VERY WARM AND 
MOIST UNSTABLE AIRMASS REMAINS WITH AFTERNOON AND EVENING CONVECTION 
LIKELY. THE BEST COVERAGE IS EXPECTED OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND

UNSEASONABLY DRY AIR MASS OVER THE FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY 
REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS MOVING SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
FROM CONVECTION OVER THE PLAINS. THESE HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD CONTINUE 
TO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT...LIMITING ANY POSSIBLE

HIGH PRESSURE AND DRY NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT PERSIST. BLOW-OFF 
FROM ONGOING MIDWEST CONVECTION MAY RESULT IN OCCASIONAL MID- TO 
HIGH-LEVEL CLOUD DECK OVER OUR AREA...BUT PRECIP EXPECTED TO HOLD 
OFF THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. TEMPS EXPECTED TO REBOUND TO GENERALLY 
ABOVE CLIMO TOMORROW AFTER SOMEWHAT BELOW CLIMO TEMPS OVERNIGHT AS 
HEIGHTS RISE IN ASSOCIATION WITH UPPER RIDGING BUILDING IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST. MAV GUIDANCE LOOKS REASONABLE AND WAS GENERALLY FOLLOWED 
CLOSELY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR
RETURNS TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FOR WEDNESDAY AHEAD OF AN
APPROACHING COLD FRONT. SCATTERED CONVECTION WILL DEVELOP ACROSS
THE REGION WEDNESDAY WITH BEST COVERAGE ACROSS THE HIGHER
ELEVATIONS. FRONT WILL PULL SOUTH AND STALL ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY. GFS SHOWS A FAIRLY UNSTABLE
AIRMASS IN PLACE FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY ALONG-NEAR THE BOUNDARY
WITH CAPES OF 2500-3000 J/KG. I EXPECT STRONG-SEVERE STORMS TO
DEVELOP OVER THE AREA BOTH DAYS WITH THE MAIN CONCERN BEING
DAMAGING DOWNBURSTS WINDS AND TORRRENTIAL RAINS CAUSING LOCALIZED
FLASH FLOODING. WBZ IS QUITE HIGH WHICH WILL LIMIT LARGE HAIL CHANCES.

FOR THE WEEKEND THROUGH MONDAY...UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGING BUILDS INTO

MS. RADARS REVEAL A FEW SHOWERS LINGERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS...BUT 
THEY SHOULD QUICKLY MOVE EAST AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE

FROM AROUND SOUTH MIDDLE TN NORTHEAST TO THE PANHANDLE OF MD. SPEED 
OF SOUTHEASTWARD MOVEMENT OF LINE HAS IT MOVED OUT OF FORECAST AREA 
BY BETWEEN, SAY, 7 AND 9 PM EDT. ANY THUNDERSTORMS COULD PRODUCE 
MINOR OUTFLOWS WHICH COULD STILL WARRANT SPS STATUS OR EVEN AN 
ISOLATED SVR WITH GUSTS. WHILE HEAVY RAIN IS STILL LIKELY WITH 
THUNDER AND HIGH PW'S SPEED OF CELLS AND ORIENTATION/DIRECTION OF 
MOVEMENT OF LINE SHOULD PROHIBIT MUCH FLOODING, EXCEPT IN VERY 
ISOLATED INSTANCES. LOW CLOUDS ALL BUT DISAPPEAR WITH FROPA AND THIS

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...ORGANIZED SYSTEM IS NOT AS
ORGANIZED AS IT HAS BEEN ADVERTISED LAST FEW DAYS. MAIN THINGS TO
WATCH FOR WILL BE EXACTLY HOW FAR SOUTH FRONT MAKES IT BEFORE
EITHER STALLING RIGHT OVER US, OR DISSIPATING. THIS TIME OF YEAR
THIS IT IS DIFFICULT FOR FRONTS TO STAY INTACT THIS FAR SOUTH.
THAT SAID, THE PROBLEM FOR THUNDERSTORMS APPEARS TO BE THE
POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING RAINS IN URBAN AREAS AND SMALL STREAMS. SOME
ISOLATED BORDERLINE SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS MAY OCCUR WITH DAMAGING
STRAIGHT LINE WINDS THE BIGGEST ISSUE.

HAVE ALSO ADJUSTED POPS DOWN AS IT APPEARS COVERAGE WILL NOT BE AS
WIDESPREAD AS PREVIOUSLY THOUGHT, THOUGH DID KEEP SOME LIKELIES IN
THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU. ALSO, ADJUSTED BOTH MAX/MIN TEMPS DOWN A
HAIR.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
STILL GENERALLY AGREE THAT DRIER CONDITIONS WILL PREVAIL THROUGH THE 
EARLY PART OF THE WORK WEEK AS REGION COMES UNDER INFLUENCE OF 
NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT. UPPER FLOW WILL GRADUALLY TRANSITION TO A
NEARLY ZONAL FLOW BY MIDWEEK. MODELS DEPICT ANOTHER DIFFUSE
BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH THE AREA FROM THE NORTH WITH OCCASIONAL MCS
ACTIVITY TRANSLATING ALONG THE BOUNDARY. HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE POPS
FOR MID WEEK WITH HIGHEST CHANCE ALONG NORTHERN TIER ZONES...
DECREASING TO SLIGHT CHANCE BY LATE WORK WEEK AND INTO NEXT WEEKEND
AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN CONUS. FOR TEMPS...
GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.DISCUSSION...WILL UP DATE ZONES TO REFLECT TIMING ISSUES ONLY. ALL 
ASPECTS OF THE ZONES LOOK GOOD. THE ONLY REAL "CONCERN" IS THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ISOLATED CONVECTION THIS AFTERNOON AND WITH SUCH WEAK 
STEERING WINDS THEY WILL MOVE SLOWLY. VAST MAJORITY OF PLACES WILL 
SEE NO RAIN, BUT THOSE WHO DO GET THE STRAY THUNDERSTORM WILL GET 
SOAKED. SOME ISOLATED BRIEF MINOR FLOODING MAY OCCUR IN CONJUNCTION. 
PRECIPITABLE WATER VALUES ARE BETWEEN 175 AND 190% OF NORMAL FOR THE 
DATE, WHICH IS SAYING SOMETHING FOR LATE SPRING/EARLY SUMMER.

SHRA/TSRA NORTHEAST TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. 

WILL CONTINUE WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE FORECAST AREA
FOR TONIGHT...AS UPPER LOW SHOULD REMAIN WELL SOUTH OF THE AREA AND
ANY SHRA/TSRA SHOULD WEAKEN/DISSIPATE DURING THE EVENING HOURS. 

NAM/GFS MODELS KEEP MOST OF DEEP MOISTURE TO THE SOUTH OF THE AREA
ON SATURDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS DUE TO
DIURNAL AFTERNOON CONVECTION. 


(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS AND SREF STILL 
PROJECTING BOUNDARY TO PASS THROUGH OUR FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS DEPICT ONLY MODEST INSTABILITY/CAPE BUT SOME SEVERE 
WEATHER CAN'T BE RULED OUT AT THIS POINT. PRECIPITATELY WATER 
APPROACHING 2 INCHES ALSO INDICATE THE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAIN WITH 
SOME OF THE CONVECTION.

FOR THE BALANCE OF THE LONG TERM...MODELS STILL GENERALLY AGREE ON 
DRY EARLY WORK WEEK. NORTHWESTERLY FLOW ALOFT ALONG WITH PLACEMENT 
OF OUR REGION ON THE PERIPHERY OF UPPER RIDGE BUILDING IN FROM THE 
SOUTHWEST INCREASES CHANCES OF MSC ACTIVITY...BUT DETAILS OF TIMING 
AND PLACEMENT OF THESE FEATURES REMAIN MURKY. HAVE CONTINUED CHANCE 
POPS OVER SEVERAL PERIODS THROUGH MUCH OF THE LATTER PORTIONS OF THE 
LONG TERM TO ACCOUNT FOR THIS UNCERTAINTY.

FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY STAYED CLOSE TO MAV GUIDANCE EARLY IN THE LONG

TENNESSEE...TO NEAR CKV TO BETWEEN OWB-BWG LINE AND THEN FURTHER
NORTHEAST TO JUST WEST OF SDF INTO NORTH CENTRAL KENTUCKY. A BROKEN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LIKED THE WRF DEPICTION OF 
EXPECTED WEATHER BETTER THAN THE GFS TODAY AS IT SEEMS TO BE PICKING 
UP ON THE EARLY MORNING LOWER OHIO VALLEY CONVECTION WHILE THE GFS 
IS A LITTLE BEHIND THE TIMES. BUMPED UP POPS A BIT ACROSS THE MAJOR 
TERRAIN AREAS TODAY BUT MORE SPECIFICALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND PART OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE. IN THESE AREAS SHORT WAVE DRIVING CONVECTION ACROSS THE 
MIDWEST MAY BE ABLE TO CLOSE IN ON THE REGION WITH OUTFLOW BOUNDARY 
ENHANCED PRECIP LATER IN THE DAY. APPLIED AREAS OF FOG AGAIN TONIGHT 
IN THE WELL MOISTENED LOW LEVEL ATMOSPHERE PROGGED ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. TWEAKED POPS FOR THIS EVENING BASED ON THIS IDEA AS 
WELL. STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE NAM TEMP GUIDANCE TODAY WHILE 
ADJUSTING A TAD TOWARD THE MAV NUMBERS TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FOR FRIDAY...A STATIONARY 
FRONT WILL BE ACROSS THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY WITH PLENTY OF 
WARM...MOIST...AND UNSTABLE AIR OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MAIN LIFT 
WILL BE FROM LOCAL TERRAIN.  FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY...AN 
UPPER SHORT-WAVE TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES PULLING 
FRONT BACK TOWARD THE NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. WILL 
HAVE THE HIGHER POPS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA-NORTHEAST TENNESSEE
AND ALONG THE MOUNTAINS.

ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONT WILL PULL ACROSS THE 
LOWER OHIO VALLEY INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY FOR SUNDAY.  WILL CALL 
FOR HIGH CHANCE-LIKELY POPS FOR SUNDAY AFTERNOON-EVENING. A BETTER 
CHANCE FOR SEVERE STORMS FOR SUNDAY AS WELL GIVEN CAPES BETWEEN 
2500-3500 J/KG. ALSO...WEAK DIVERGENCE ALONG NOTED ALOFT AND 
STEERING WINDS WILL ALSO BE STRONGER WITH 850MB JET OF 30-35KTS. 
MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW SOME MID-LEVEL DRIER AIR WHICH WILL ALSO HELP 
ENHANCE DOWNDRAFT STRENGTH. WILL HIGHLIGHT WITHIN THE HWO.

FOR MONDAY...FRONT PULLS SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AND BECOMES 
STATIONARY OVER THE GULF COAST STATES. DRIER AND MORE STABLE AIR 
DEPICTED ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...SO WILL CALL FOR A DRY 
DAY.

FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY...NORTHWEST FLOW ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN-CENTRAL PLAINS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY-GULF COAST STATES 
WILL SET THE STAGE FOR MCS DEVELOPMENT. AT THIS TIME...AIRMASS IS 
TOO STABLE FOR CONVECTION MONDAY NIGHT...BUT ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER 
THE WESTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY MAY BE ENOUGH TO PULL THE REMAINS OF A 
MCS INTO THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY...MAINLY ALONG AND SOUTH OF 
INTERSTATE 40.

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...FRONT TO OUR SOUTH WILL PULL 
CLOSER NORTH WITH INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT.  WILL INCREASE CHANCES 
OF CONVECTION...ESPECIALLY FOR EAST TENNESSEE. HOWEVER...CONFIDENCE 
IS LOW.

NRN PARTS OF MIDDLE TN. WILL MONITOR THIS ACTIVITY...BUT FOR NOW 
DON'T SEE MORE THAN VCSH AND CB FOR CHA AND TYS FOR A FEW MORE HOURS.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...LATEST 88-D IMAGES FROM KHTX-
KMRX RADARS INDICATE THAT WIDELY SCATTERED SHRA/TSRA HAS BEEN
FORMING FROM NEAR CHA-EXTENDING NORTHEAST ALONG I-75 TO NEAR MCMINN
COUNTY AND THEN FURTHER EAST AND SOUTHEAST INTO WESTERN NORTH
CAROLINA. PRECIP FORMING IN MORE UNSTABLE ATMOSPHERE WITH HIGHER
CAPE VALUES RANGING FROM 1500-2000 J/KG. WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...EXCEPT FOR THE SMOKYS
AREA AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...WHERE WILL CONTINUE WITH 30 PERCENT
CHANCE POPS.

MAY HAVE SOME SCATTERED LOW FOG AT SOME LOCATIONS OVERNIGHT...SO
WILL ADD IN A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG IN ZONES TONIGHT.

HAVE DECIDED TO LOWER POPS SOMEWHAT FOR THURSDAY...AS MODELS ARE
PROGGING THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO ONLY MOVE SLOWLY SOUTHEAST TO NEAR
THE OHIO RIVER DURING THE DAY. WILL DROP POPS INTO THE 30-40 PERCENT
CHANCE CATEGORY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TO ACCOUNT FOR THE SLOWING
DOWN OF THE BOUNDARY TO THE NORTHWEST. HAVE UPPED TEMPS AROUND A
CATEGORY WITH A LITTLE MORE EXPECTED SUNSHINE.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...
FRONTAL SYSTEM THAT HAS BEEN POISED TO THE NORTH LOOKS LIKE IT WILL 
STAY NORTH THE NEXT FEW DAYS AS IT WAFFLES ABOUT THE OHIO RIVER.  
FINALLY ON SUNDAY IT LOOKS LIKE IT SHOULD GET A GOOD PUSH AND MAKE 
IT THROUGH THE AREA.  BY SUNDAY...DEW POINTS SHOULD BE RIDING HIGH 
WITH THE UPPER 60S TO LOWER 70S COMMON AHEAD OF THE FRONT...AND WITH 
MLCAPE VALUES POSSIBLY GETTING TO NEAR 2000 J/KG.  WE'RE STILL 
SEVERAL DAYS AWAY...BUT THERE IS SOME LIKELIHOOD OF A SEVERE 
THREAT IF THE FRONTAL PASSAGE OCCURS DURING THE AFTERNOON OR EVENING 
HOURS.

AFTER THE FRONT PASSES...HAVE GONE WITH A DRY FORECAST THOUGHT 
TUESDAY MORNING AS HIGH PRESSURE FILLS IN...HOWEVER...WITH IT THIS 
LATE INTO THE SPRING...THE FRONT AND MOISTURE DON'T GET VERY FAR 
AWAY.  NEXT CHANCE OF PRECIP WILL ALREADY BE OCCURRING BY TUESDAY 
AFTERNOON AND INTO NEXT WEDNESDAY AS THE MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY 
RETURN.

BEFORE THE FRONT APPROACHES...FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...THE AIR MASS 
WILL BE UNSTABLE.  IT LOOKS LIKE ON FRIDAY THERE MAY BE A LITTLE 
MORE ORGANIZED LIFT...SO I HAVE A LITTLE HIGHER POPS ON FRIDAY THAN 
ON SATURDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
THE LATEST 13Z SURFACE ANALYSIS AND IR SATELLITE IMAGE INDICATES
THAT DECAYING MCS MOVING THROUGH OHIO RIVER VALLEY WILL CONTINUE TO
SHIFT EAST THROUGH NORTHERN KENTUCKY...SOUTHEAST INDIANA AND INTO
OHIO THROUGH EARLY AFTERNOON. OUTFLOW BOUNDARY INDICATED BY FORT
CAMPBELL 88-D MOVING SOUTHEAST INTO SOUTH CENTRAL KENTUCKY. MAY
HAVE TO WATCH THIS FOR MID AFTERNOON ACROSS PLATEAU AND NORTHERN
COUNTIES. HAVE ALSO CANCELLED DENSE FOG ADVISORY...AS VISBILITIES
ACROSS THE AREA HAVE RISEN ABOVE CRITERIA.

AT THIS TIME...WILL CONTINUE WITH CHANCE POPS FOR FORECAST AREA
BASED UPON EXPECTED BOUNDARY MOVING TOWARD AREA AND INSTABILITY
OVER AREA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS IN SOUTHERN PORTION OF AREA INDICATE
THAT CAPES DO GET ABOVE 2000 J/KG BY AFTERNOON...SO WILL CONTINUE
WITH BASICALLY SIMILAR PRECIP CHANCES AND WILL GO MORE IN LINE WITH
NAM POPS FOR AFTERNOON.

REST OF FORECAST LOOKS PRETTY GOOD AND WILL NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR
CHANGES AT THIS TIME.

.SHORT TERM...PLENTY OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE IS PRODUCING PATCHY
DENSE FOG AND LOW CLOUDS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. FOG WILL
DISSIPATE BY MID-MORNING. MODELS SHOW LITTLE IF ANY UPPER SUPPORT
FOR CONVECTION TODAY...SO TERRAIN FORCING WILL BE THE MAIN LIFT.
MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW AIRMASS WILL BE MODERATELY UNSTABLE ACROSS THE
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA WITH CAPES OVER 2000 J/KG WITH
MORE STABLE AIR OVER SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA-NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. WILL
HAVE THE HIGHEST POPS SOUTH AND ALONG THE TERRAIN FOR THIS AFTERNOON-
EVENING. CONVECTION WILL DISSIPATE AFTER SUNSET.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)... A TYPICAL SUMMERTIME
PATTERN WILL CHARACTERIZE THE REST OF THE WEEK...WITH A WEAK FLOW
ALOFT AND A WARM AND HUMID AIR MASS IN THE LOW LEVELS. THUS SHOWERS
AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE GENERALLY SCATTERED AROUND THE AREA
DURING THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING HOURS THROUGH SATURDAY.
HOWEVER...THERE MAY BE A BETTER CHANCE OF SHOWERS ON THURSDAY AS
WEAK UPPER TROUGH MOVES ACROSS THE AREA. THE ENTRANCE REGION OF A
300 MB JET STREAK OVER THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS MAY PROVIDE LIKELY
POPS ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS THURSDAY AFTERNOON/EVENING.

A MORE SIGNIFICANT TROUGH AND FRONTAL PASSAGE IS EXPECTED ON SUNDAY 
AS THE POLAR JET DIVES SOUTHWARD OVER THE OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS. GFS...ECMWF..AND THE GEM ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH 
THE FROPA OCCURRING SUNDAY EVENING. WILL RAISE POPS TO A HIGH CHANCE 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. A DEEP TROUGH DEVELOPS OVER THE EAST 
COAST...ALLOWING A COOLER AND DRIER AIR MASS TO BUILD OVER THE AREA. 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY LOOK DRY WITH A DEEP NORTHWEST FLOW AND HIGH 
PRESSURE BUILDING OVER THE AREA.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE AREA OVERNIGHT WILL BE PULLING 
OUT THROUGH THE MORNING. HOWEVER THERE IS A MIDLEVEL TROUGH LOCATED 
NEAR THE MS VALLEY THAT WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA LATER TODAY. WHILE 
FORCING WITH THE TROUGH IS WEAK...IT SHOULD PROVIDE ENOUGH LIFT IN 
THIS MOIST AIR MASS TO DEVELOP SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SHOWERS TODAY. 
THE PASSAGE OF THE TROUGH WILL PUSH THE MOISTURE AXIS TO OUR SOUTH 
AND EAST FOR WEDNESDAY...AND SOME DRIER AIR IS ABLE TO MOVE INTO THE 
NORTHERN SECTIONS. THUS PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE LOWERED TO A LOW 
CHANCE SOUTH AND SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH. TEMPS WILL BE WARMER AS 
WELL...REACHING TO NEAR 90 IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY. ANOTHER WEAK 
TROUGH WILL PUSH THROUGH THE AREA THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT. WILL 
KEEP POPS IN THE HIGH CHANCE RANGE THIS PERIOD...IN LINE WITH MOS 
GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)... RELATIVELY ACTIVE PERIOD WITH
A SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY DROPPING SOUTH INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
REGION AND HANGING AROUND FOR POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE FOCUS FOR FRIDAY
WITH SUGGESTION OF SHORTWAVE TROF TRANSITING THE LOWER TENNESSEE
VALLEY SO USED A 40 PERCENT POP HERE WHILE ADJUSTING BACK TO A 30
PERCENT POP WITH UNCERTAINTY IN TIMING ARRIVAL OF NEXT SIGNIFICANT
UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL BOUNDARY. TRIED TO
INDICATE BEST CHANCE FOR THIS SYSTEM'S ARRIVAL TO BE SUNDAY WITH
CANADIAN/ECMWF/GFS IN THE NEIGHBORHOOD CONCERNING TIMING. FOR
MONDAY WENT WITH ECMWF IDEA OF DRIER NORTHWEST FLOW BEHIND
DEPARTING UPPER TROF. SO JUST APPLIED A SLIGHT CHANCE POP AT THIS
TIME PERIOD. FOR TEMPS TRIED TO STAY AWAY FROM SOME OF THE EXTREMES

.DISCUSSION...
LATEST 14Z SURFACE ANALYSIS AND VISIBLE SATELLITE PICS INDICATE THAT
LOW-MID LEVEL DRYING CONTINUES ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. UPPER LOW WELL
TO THE SOUTHWEST OF THE AREA AND INCREASED ATLANTIC LOW LEVEL
MOISTURE SHOULD PROVIDE MOST OF THE FOCUS FOR SCATTERED/NUMEROUS
SHRA/TSRA IN ESPECIALLY THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF TENNESSEE THIS
AFTERNOON. 

WILL CONTINUE WITH BASIC TRENDING IN FORECAST WITH JUST CHANCE POPS
IN SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTH AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND 50 POPS
FOR CENTRAL AREAS FOR AFTERNOON. INSTABILITY IS NOT AS IMPRESSIVE
AS YESTERDAY AS PER 12Z OHX SOUNDING AND AREA IS NOT OUTLOOKED FOR
SEVERE...BUT WOULD NOT RULE OUT AN ISOLATED STRONG/SEVERE CELL FOR
AFTERNOON ESPECIALLY IN SOUTHERN COUNTIES.

A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDS FROM THE GREAT LAKES ACROSS THE

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
EXTENDING ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS...WITH A 
MORE MOIST AIR MASS (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) ACROSS THE FORECAST

THE MID AND UPPER LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME MORE CYCLONIC TODAY AS A 
WEAK UPPER LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE AREA FROM NORTH TO SOUTH. A 
SOUTHEASTERLY FLOW OFF THE ATLANTIC AT 850 MB SHOULD ALSO HELP 
SUPPLY ADDITIONAL MOISTURE THIS AFTERNOON. THOUGH THESE CHANGES TO 
THE PATTERN ARE WEAK AND SUBTLE...THEY SHOULD BE ENOUGH TO INCREASE 
THE CHANCES OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO LIKELY ACROSS THE ENTIRE

MULTICELL VARIETY. HOWEVER A FEW SEVERE STORMS CANNOT BE RULED OUT 
GIVEN THE GOOD CAPE. MOST OF THE STORMS SHOULD DISSIPATE WITH SUNSET 
AS THERE IS LITTLE UPPER SUPPORT TO KEEP THE STORMS GOING

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A DIFFUSE AND POORLY-DEFINED FRONTAL BOUNDARY OVER 
THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE LINGERING OVER 
THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OFF THE CAROLINA COAST. THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
IS PROGGED TO GRADUALLY SINK INTO THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...AND 
COULD POSSIBLY TRIGGER SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION THROUGH THE NIGHT- 
TIME HOURS. A STAGNANT SUMMERLIKE PATTERN WILL CONTINUE THROUGH 
SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING EACH 
DAY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL 
BECOME MORE DIFLUENT ON FRIDAY...RESULTING IN A BETTER COVERAGE OF 
CONVECTION. IN ADDITION...A CUT-OFF UPPER LOW IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP 
OVER THE DEEP SOUTH BY SATURDAY...HELPING TO TRIGGER ADDITIONAL 
SCATTERED CONVECTION THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO 
FOLLOW PERSISTENCE WITH MINS THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...WITH GRADUALLY 
LOWERING MAXES EACH DAY DUE TO THE INCREASING COVERAGE OF CLOUDS AND 
CONVECTION.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...UNSETTLED WEATHER PATTERN IN 
STORE FOR MUCH OF THE EXTENDED. AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE WILL BRING A 
SLIGHT CHANCE OF CONVECTION ON SUNDAY...WITH A BETTER CHANCE MONDAY. 
A WEAKENING COLD FRONT SLIDES IN FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. THERE 
WILL BE A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVES MOVING THROUGH THE FLOW DURING THE

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE LINGERING 
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OFF THE CAROLINA COAST...WHICH WAS 
CONTINUING TO PRODUCE A MOIST NORTHEASTERLY FLOW ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA. MODELS REVEAL A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS DEVELOPING AGAIN 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH DRIER AIR (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) IN THE LOWER 
LEVELS PRODUCING A MORE PRONOUNCED INVERTED-V PROFILE FOR THIS 
AFTERNOON. THIS INVERTED-V PROFILE WILL RESULT IN THE POSSIBILITY OF 
STRONG DAMAGING DOWNBURST WINDS WITH ANY STORM THAT DEVELOPS THIS 
AFTERNOON. CURRENT TEMP FORECAST LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK...BUT WILL 
PLAN TO RAISE MAXES A LITTLE FOR THIS AFTERNOON...DUE TO THE DRIER 
AIR IN THE BOUNDARY LAYER. 

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING MAINLY FOR 
SOME MINOR WORDING TWEAKS...AND WILL UPDATE THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER 
OUTLOOK TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF SOME STRONG DAMAGING WINDS 
WITH A FEW STORMS THIS AFTERNOON.

THAT FORECAST AREA REMAINS IN WESTERN PORTION OF PERSISTENT LOW-MID
LEVEL RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE. WEAK FRONTAL TROUGH ANALYZED TO BE
MOVING ACROSS SOUTHERN ILLINOIS AND INDIANA EARLY THIS AM. COLD
FRONT LIKELY FURTHER BACK INTO SOUTHERN IOWA AND INTO NORTHERN
MISSOURI. 

FOR TODAY...WILL CONTINUE WITH PERSISTENCE INVOLVING THE FORECAST...
AS EXPECT ISOLATED/SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR AREA MUCH LIKE WEDNESDAY.
NAM/GFS MODELS CONTINUE TO PUSH WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY SOUTH OF THE
OHIO RIVER BY 00Z TONIGHT AND INTO SOUTHERN KENTUCKY BY 12Z FRIDAY.
MAY HAVE TO WATCH NORTHERN PLATEAU AND KENTUCKY BORDER COUNTIES BY
END OF SHORT TERM FORECAST PERIOD FOR POTENTIAL FOR CHANCE POPS...
BUT DUE TO UNCERTAINTY OF TIMING...WILL KEEP POPS IN SLIGHT CHANCE
POP CATEGORY. TEMPS LOOK GENERALLY GOOD FOR FORECAST AREA AS PER
GOING FORECAST. 

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE
SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST FROM THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY ACROSS THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY FRIDAY...THEN TO THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY FOR SATURDAY.

ANOTHER UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS TO THE
NORTHERN GREAT LAKES SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY LIFTING THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SHORT-WAVE BACK ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY
AND MONDAY NIGHT. OVERALL...A CONTINUED CHANCE OF CONVECTION
THROUGH MOST OF THE EXTENDED PERIOD WITH BEST CHANCES FRIDAY AND

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC OFF 
THE CAROLINA COAST...WITH A WEAK COLD FRONT ACROSS THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES REGION. THIS COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO 
EVENTUALLY DISSIPATE IN THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY...WITH THE 
ATLANTIC LOW CONTINUING TO PRODUCE A MOIST NORTHEASTERLY FLOW ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. AS A RESULT...EXPECT A 
SUMMERLIKE PATTERN TO CONTINUE WITH A MARGINALLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
DEVELOPING EACH DAY. THIS SCENARIO SHOULD RESULT IN ISOLATED 
CONVECTION THIS EVENING AND REDEVELOPING BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON. 
MODELS ARE IN AGREEMENT THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL BECOME MORE 
DIFLUENT ON FRIDAY...RESULTING IN A BETTER COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. 
AS FOR TEMPS...WILL PLAN TO FOLLOW A PERSISTENCE FORECAST THROUGH 
FRIDAY NIGHT...SINCE THE AIR MASS IS NOT EXPECTED TO CHANGE MUCH. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS NOT TOO DISSIMILAR 
IN DEPICTION OF EVENTS IN THE EXTENDED PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. 
SOLUTIONS STILL HOLD ONTO A WEAK UPPER LOW DROPPING SLOWLY SOUTH 
THROUGH DIXIE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. CREATED MORE OF A NORTH TO SOUTH 
GRADIENT IN POP FOR CONVECTION ON SATURDAY WITH BETTER CHANCE ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AS BACK DOOR FRONT 
SHIFTS FARTHER SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. HIGHER 
PRESSURE GRADUALLY REPLACES THE PRESSURE WEAKNESS BY SUNDAY INTO 
MONDAY SO EDGED POPS BACK JUST A BIT. BY TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
MODELS INDICATE ZONAL FLOW DEVELOPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE 
COUNTRY WHICH WILL ALLOW ANOTHER FRONTAL BOUNDARY TO PRESS SOUTH 
THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY. THUS...THE CHANCE FOR RAIN WILL BE A LITTLE 
HIGHER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY BY WEDNESDAY AS 
SCATTERED CONVECTION WOULD BE MORE LIKELY TO FORM AHEAD OF THE COOL 
FRONT.

UNITED STATES KEEPING PLENTY OF MOISTURE-INSTABILITY OVER THE AREA
TO CONTINUE 20-40 POPS FOR SATURDAY WITH BEST CHANCES OVER
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE...SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA...AND PLATEAU DUE TO
UPSLOPE FLOW.

FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY...UPPER RIDGING WILL DOMINATE PRODUCING
WARMER CONDITIONS...BUT MOISTURE-INSTABILITY REMAINS TO KEEP

STILL LOOKS REASONABLE.  TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON 
TRACK.  WILL UPDATE FORECAST TO REMOVE MORNING WORDING...NO OTHER 
CHANGES PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OFF THE 
CAROLINA COAST AND HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES WILL 
PRODUCE DEEP EASTERLY WINDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. THE 
UPSLOPE FLOW IS PRODUCING SCATTERED SHOWERS OVER WESTERN NORTH 
CAROLINA. HOWEVER...DOWNSLOPING INTO THE VALLEY IS DISSIPATING THE 
SHOWERS BEFORE SPREADING WEST INTO THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS SHOW 
THE AIRMASS BECOMING MARGINALLY UNSTABLE DURING THE AFTERNOON WITH 
CAPES APPROACHING 1000 J/KG. MAIN FORCING WILL BE TERRAIN WITH 
UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE PLATEAU AND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE PRODUCING THE 
BEST CHANCES THERE THIS AFTERNOON-EVENING.

DOWNSLOPING WINDS INTO THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY 
WILL LIKELY KEEP TRI AND MRX DRY TODAY. TRENDED TOWARD GFS MOS.

CONVECTION WILL DISSIPATE THIS EVENING AFTER LOSS OF DAYTIME HEATING.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...UPPER LOW OFF THE ATLANTIC 
COAST WILL CONTINUE TO DRIFT SOUTHEAST AND AWAY FORM THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION BY LATE WORK WEEK. SUFFICIENT MOISTURE LINGERS TO 
WARRANT SLIGHT CHANCE OF MAINLY DIURNAL POPS FOR BOTH WEDNESDAY AND 
THURSDAY. A WEAK FRONT SAGS THROUGH THE REGION IN THE LATE FRIDAY 
THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY TIME FRAME. MODELS AND ENSEMBLES IN GOOD 
ENOUGH AGREEMENT WITH THIS FEATURE TO JUSTIFY BUMPING POPS UP INTO 
THE LOW CHANCE CATEGORY. CONTINUED DRY FORECAST FOR LATE WEEKEND AS 
FRONT PUSHES SOUTH OF THE AREA. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE SIGNIFICANTLY
BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM. THUS DID NOT MAKE ANY MAJOR CHANGES FOR
THAT TIME FRAME. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM

.AVIATION...CONVECTION THIS EVENING HAS BEEN CONFINED TO A RANDOM 
SHOWER OR TWO OVER SWRN VA...WHILE VARYING AMOUNTS OF CUMULUS CLOUDS 
LINGER ACROSS THE BULK OF THE FORECAST AREA. EXPECT THESE LOW CLOUDS 
TO DISSIPATE TO SOME DEGREE...BUT FORECAST SOUNDINGS FOR TYS AND TRI 
SUGGEST A BROKEN VFR (POSSIBLY MVFR) LAYER TO LINGER OVERNIGHT. 

DILEMMA IS THAT SIGNIFICANT CLEARING PLUS DIMINISHING WINDS WOULD 
ALLOW FOR BETTER FOG DEVELOPMENT. I DID RAISE THE CEILING AND VSBY 
FOR LATER TONIGHT FOR TRI FROM PREVIOUS FORECAST...AND WILL WAIT AND 
SEE ON LOWER CLOUDS AND AREAS OF FOG.

OTHERWISE...LOOK FOR VFR CONDITIONS BY WEDNESDAY LATE MORNING OR

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL LOW OVER 
EASTERN GREAT LAKES WITH TROUGH EXTENDING ACROSS EASTERN STATES 
INCLUDING TN VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON. A BROAD SURFACE LOW WAS LOCATED 
FROM OHIO SOUTH ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WHICH 
SEPARATED SLIGHTLY DRIER AIR WEST OF THE MOUNTAINS AND MORE MOIST 
AIR TO THE EAST. SHOWERS WERE STILL OCCURRING IN NE TN AND SW VA BUT 
COVERAGE WAS BEGINNING TO DIMINISH. MODELS SHOW WEAK HIGH PRESSURE 
PUSHING DOWN INTO THE TN VALLEY TODAY AND TONIGHT AS COLD FRONT 
CONTINUES TO MOVE SOUTH AND EAST AWAY FROM THE REGION. WILL CONTINUE 
CHANCE SHOWERS THIS EVENING ENDING BY MIDNIGHT NE OTHERWISE DRY WITH 
CLEARING SKIES SOUTH. LOWS COOLER WITH DRIER COOLER AIR MASS. 
FOLLOWED CLOSE TO MAV NUMBERS TONIGHT. PATCHY FOG EXPECTED NE 
SECTIONS WHERE RAIN FELL TODAY. WEDNESDAY UPPER TROUGH ELONGATES 
BACK OVER MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. THIS WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY 
CLOUDY WITH HIGHS ONCE AGAIN IN THE MID 60S TO UPPER 70S. SHORT WAVE 
ENERGY ROTATING AROUND UPPER TROUGH MAY BRING A FEW SHOWERS TO THE 
NE SO SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS THERE. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS 
ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT WITH THE OVERALL SYNOPTIC PATTERN THROUGH 
THE EXTENDED PERIOD...BUT REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE 
SMALLER-SCALE DETAILS. THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH OVER THE APPALACHIANS 
WILL FINALLY EXIT THE FORECAST AREA ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT ANOTHER 
UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL QUICKLY MOVE TOWARDS THE MS RIVER VALLEY ON 
THURSDAY. MODELS INDICATE THAT THIS UPPER TROUGH WILL TRIGGER SOME 
ISOLATED CONVECTION OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY THURSDAY AFTERNOON... 
WITH CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY GRADUALLY INCREASING IN AREAL COVERAGE BY 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS A WARM FRONT MOVES NORTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA. A 
SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE MID MS 
RIVER VALLEY BY FRIDAY MORNING...AND QUICKLY MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE 
GREAT LAKES REGION BY FRIDAY NIGHT. WILL PLAN TO MENTION LIKELY POPS 
FOR FRIDAY INTO FRIDAY NIGHT...AS THIS SYSTEM PULLS A WEAKENING COLD 
FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS AGREE THAT A 
LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BECOME CENTERED OFF THE NORTHEAST 
COAST BY THE WEEKEND...PRODUCING A MOIST EASTERLY FLOW FROM THE 
ATLANTIC OCEAN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. AS A 
RESULT...EXPECT A MOIST AND UNSTABLE AIR MASS TO LINGER INTO EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...WITH SCATTERED CONVECTION EXPECTED EACH DAY THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND AND EARLY NEXT WEEK. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE 
GFS NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH

SOUTHWEST VA AND NORTHEAST TN. ANOTHER UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS THEN 
PROGGED TO MOVE QUICKLY INTO THE MS RIVER VALLEY ON THURSDAY... 
PRODUCING ANOTHER SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER OHIO 
RIVER VALLEY. THIS SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE NORTHEAST INTO 
THE GREAT LAKES REGION ON FRIDAY...BUT A WARM AND MODERATELY 
UNSTABLE AIR MASS WILL BE LEFT OVER THE FORECAST AREA...LEADING TO 
AN INCREASED CHANCE FOR CONVECTION. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE THEN 
DEVELOPS OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY FOR THE WEEKEND...WHICH CREATES A 
NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS UPPER- 
LEVEL PATTERN WILL CREATE A MODERATELY TO POSSIBLY VERY UNSTABLE AIR 
MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND...LEADING TO 
CONTINUED CHANCES FOR CONVECTION THROUGH MONDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL 
TREND TOWARDS THE GFS NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED...WHICH ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

.DISCUSSION...LOW PRESSURE OVER THE OHIO RIVER WITH DIFFUSE FRONT
EXTENDING SOUTHWEST THROUGH KY AND MIDDLE AND WEST TN WILL MOVE
LITTLE TODAY. THE COLD FRONT WILL ADVANCE SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE
TENNESSEE VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
TONIGHT. AN UPPER LOW OVER THE MID MS VALLEY WILL SHIFT INTO THE
OHIO VALLEY BY TONIGHT AND SHORT WAVE ENERGY ROTATING AROUND IT
WILL SET OFF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THIS AFTERNOON ALONG THE
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THE CURRENT
SCATTERED ACTIVITY ON THE NORTHERN PLATEAU WILL INCREASE IN
COVERAGE AND INTENSITY GRADUALLY LATE THIS MORNING AND AFTERNOON.
UPDATED FORECAST TO INCREASE POPS THIS AFTERNOON TO LIKELY. CLOUDS
SHOULD BREAK FOR A FEW HOURS. THE HEATING WILL LEAD TO THUNDERSTORMS
DEVELOPING BY EARLY TO MID AFTERNOON. SOME STORMS MAY BECOME SEVERE
WITH LARGE HAIL ESPECIALLY NORTHERN PLATEAU AND NE TN AND SW VA
CLOSER TO UPPER LOW MOVEMENT. DAMAGING WINDS ALSO A CONCERN AND
LOCALLY HEAVY RAIN PRODUCING LOCALIZED FLOODING POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CONSIDERABLE MOISTURE WILL

GRADUALLY SHIFT INTO THE AREA...AND A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH 
DURING THE PERIOD.  EXPECT SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AGAIN TODAY 
AHEAD OF THE FRONT...AND SOME OF THESE STORMS MAY BECOME SEVERE THIS

FLOODING...BUT THREAT DOES NOT LOOK WIDESPREAD ENOUGH TO WARRANT A 
FLOOD WATCH AT THIS TIME.  NO ARGUMENTS WITH MAV TEMPS FOR THE SHORT 
TERM.   

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM WILL SHIFT SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE UPPER OHIO VALLEY TUESDAY 
INTO WEDNESDAY KEEPING THE CHANCE FOR SCATTERED TO WIDELY SCATTERED 
SHOWERS AND A THUNDERSTORM ALIVE ACROSS MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON 
TUESDAY. DROP POPS BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE BY WEDNESDAY AS THE LOW 
MOVES FARTHER EAST TAKING THE BETTER LIFT/MOISTURE INTO THE 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. AND MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES. DROPPED POPS ON 
THURSDAY AS MODELS INDICATE UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS EAST AHEAD OF 
YET ANOTHER SLOW MOVING UPPER LEVEL LOW. MOISTURE INCREASES THURSDAY 
NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS A SURFACE WAVE RIDES NORTHEAST INTO THE UPPER 
MIDWEST AND SHORTWAVE ENERGY BUILDS INTO THE MID SOUTH. APPLIED 
SLIGHT THROUGH LOW CHANCE POPS FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT FOR THE 
POSSIBILITY OF INCREASED LIFT WITH SURFACE TROF ADVANCING NORTHEAST

.DISCUSSION...THE "FRONT" IS HARD TO FIND. DOES NOT APPEAR IN 
DEWPOINTS, TEMP, OR PRESSURE FIELDS VERY WELL AT ALL, ALTHOUGH THERE 
IS A VERY TIGHT GRADIENT OF THETA E NORTH OF US IN KY. WIND FIELD 
DOES SHOW A WEAK AREA OF CONVERGENCE IN WEST TENNESSEE WHICH 
BROADENS OUT TO THE EAST. SO THERE DOES APPEAR TO BE A WEAK FOCUSING 
MECHANISM OVER THE AREA WITH PLENTY OF MOISTURE. THERE ALSO MAY BE 
SOME VERY WEAK DIFFLUENCE ALOFT AS SOME CLOUD/WV ELEMENTS APPEAR TO 
MOVE AWAY FROM EACH OTHER OVER THE AREA. THIS WOULD IMPLY THAT WEAK, 
BROAD UPLIFT IS LIKELY AND SO CATEGORICAL FORECAST FOR RAIN APPEARS 
ON TRACK, WITH MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS AND LOCALLY HEAVY RAINFALL A 
GOOD BET.

TODAY/EARLY TONIGHT.  THIS WILL BRING ANOTHER ROUND OF SHOWERS AND

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL TROF WILL 
STRENGTHEN DEEPENING SUFFICIENTLY TO ALLOW DEVELOPMENT OF A CLOSED

FEATURE. UPPER LEVEL LOW IN NO HURRY TO LEAVE AND WILL MAKE ONLY

FOR LIFTING ON TUESDAY SO USED GRADATION OF HIGH CHANCE POPS 
NORTHERN AND EASTERN AREAS THROUGH SLIGHT CHANCE POP FARTHER 
SOUTHWEST. SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR SHOWERS WILL SUFFICE FOR NOW ON 
WEDNESDAY AS A SHOWER IS CERTAINLY STILL POSSIBLE ACROSS PART OF THE

.DISCUSSION...THUNDERSTORMS ARE WEAKENING THIS EVENING. WILL UPDATE 
ZONE FORECAST TO LOWER POPS FOR TONIGHT. TEMPERATURES AND THE REST 
OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK. NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM SW NC TO MIDDLE TN ARE FORMING IN A 
ZONE OF DEEP MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND AN AXIS OF INSTABILITY. 
MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE NOT AS STEEP TODAY AS YESTERDAY...RESULTING 
IN LESS CAPE...BUT LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS REMAIN A 
POSSIBILITY THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON. THERE WILL BE SOME 
WEAK UPPER DIVERGENCE AS WELL...BUT THIS DEPARTS AFTER SUNSET...SO 
WITH LITTLE UPPER SUPPORT MOST ACTIVITY SHOULD DISSIPATE BY 
MIDNIGHT. 

ON SUNDAY A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL TRACK FROM THE LOWER MS VALLEY 
TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS. A DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF WILL 
PROVIDE ABUNDANT MOISTURE AS PW RISE TO 1.8 INCHES. THE MAIN CONCERN 
TOMORROW IS THE AMOUNT OF RAIN THAT MAY FALL IN THE PLATEAU COUNTIES 
THAT SAW SOME FLOODING YESTERDAY AND MAY SEE MORE AGAIN TODAY. A 
FLOOD WATCH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED...BUT AS MOST PRECIP WILL COME 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON...WILL LET THE MID SHIFT EVALUATE NEWER MODEL 
QPF. RAISED POPS UP TO CATEGORICAL IN WESTERN SECTIONS TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON. THE THREAT FOR SEVERE LOOKS MINIMAL TOMORROW AS MORNING 
CLOUDS WILL INHIBIT HEATING AND DESTABILIZATION.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SUNDAY NIGHT SHORTWAVE 
ENERGY CONTINUES TO SWING NORTHEAST OUT OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY INTO THE TN VALLEY GENERATING CONSIDERABLE SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WITH UNSTABLE AIR MASS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST 
U.S. VERY HIGH RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY AS A DEEPENING UPPER TROF MOVES FROM THE PLAINS STATES INTO 
THE MIDWEST. A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREA ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROF
WILL SHIFT FROM THE MS RIVER TO OHIO. COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL
COLLIDE WITH MOIST/UNSTABLE AIR ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED THREAT FOR
HEAVY RAINFALL SUNDAY NIGHT AND POSSIBLY INTO EARLY MONDAY.
FLOODING WILL BE THE MAIN SEVERE WEATHER THREAT FOR THAT TIME.

FROM MONDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY THE SYSTEM WILL CLOSE OFF INTO AN 
UPPER LOW AND MAKE SLOW PROGRESS EASTWARD. THIS LARGE CIRCULATION 
HAS SEVERAL SHORT WAVES WITH IT THAT WILL ROTATE SOUTH AND EAST 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS KEEPING SHOWERS IN THE 
FORECAST NE TN AND SW VA THROUGH THAT PERIOD. THE NW FLOW AROUND THE 
UPPER LOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL FOR A FEW DAYS BUT 
WARMING WILL TAKE PLACE BY THE END OF THE WEEK INTO SATURDAY. 
ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE AREA DEVELOPING OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
THURSDAY WILL MOVE SLOWLY NORTHEAST TOWARDS THE EASTERN TENNESSEE 
VALLEY FRIDAY. WILL INTRODUCE POPS BACK IN THE SOUTH SATURDAY AS 
THINK THE UPPER LOW WILL BE SLOW TO EXIT TO THE NORTHEAST AND THE 
NEXT SYSTEM WILL MOVE SLOWER.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FROM SW NC TO MIDDLE TN ARE FORMING IN A 
ZONE OF DEEP MOISTURE CONVERGENCE AND AN AXIS OF INSTABILITY. 
MID LEVEL LAPSE RATES ARE NOT AS STEEP TODAY AS YESTERDAY...RESULTING 
IN LESS CAPE...BUT LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS REMAIN A 
POSSIBILITY THROUGH THE REST OF THE AFTERNOON. THERE WILL BE SOME 
WEAK UPPER DIVERGENCE AS WELL...BUT THIS DEPARTS AFTER SUNSET...SO 
WITH LITTLE UPPER SUPPORT MOST ACTIVITY SHOULD DISSIPATE BY 
MIDNIGHT. 

ON SUNDAY A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL TRACK FROM THE LOWER MS VALLEY 
TOWARD THE APPALACHIANS. A DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF WILL 
PROVIDE ABUNDANT MOISTURE AS PW RISE TO 1.8 INCHES. THE MAIN CONCERN 
TOMORROW IS THE AMOUNT OF RAIN THAT MAY FALL IN THE PLATEAU COUNTIES 
THAT SAW SOME FLOODING YESTERDAY AND MAY SEE MORE AGAIN TODAY. A 
FLOOD WATCH HAS BEEN CONSIDERED...BUT AS MOST PRECIP WILL COME 
TOMORROW AFTERNOON...WILL LET THE MID SHIFT EVALUATE NEWER MODEL 
QPF. RAISED POPS UP TO CATEGORICAL IN WESTERN SECTIONS TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON. THE THREAT FOR SEVERE LOOKS MINIMAL TOMORROW AS MORNING 
CLOUDS WILL INHIBIT HEATING AND DESTABILIZATION.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SUNDAY NIGHT SHORTWAVE 
ENERGY CONTINUES TO SWING NORTHEAST OUT OF THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY INTO THE TN VALLEY GENERATING CONSIDERABLE SHOWER AND 
THUNDERSTORM ACTIVITY WITH UNSTABLE AIR MASS ACROSS THE SOUTHEAST 
U.S. VERY HIGH RAIN CHANCES WILL CONTINUE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY AS A DEEPENING UPPER TROF MOVES FROM THE PLAINS STATES INTO 
THE MIDWEST. A SURFACE LOW PRESSURE AREA ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROF
WILL SHIFT FROM THE MS RIVER TO OHIO. COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL
COLLIDE WITH MOIST/UNSTABLE AIR ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS
LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY. THERE WILL BE A CONTINUED THREAT FOR
HEAVY RAINFALL SUNDAY NIGHT AND POSSIBLY INTO EARLY MONDAY.
FLOODING WILL BE THE MAIN SEVERE WEATHER THREAT FOR THAT TIME.

FROM MONDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY THE SYSTEM WILL CLOSE OFF INTO AN 
UPPER LOW AND MAKE SLOW PROGRESS EASTWARD. THIS LARGE CIRCULATION 
HAS SEVERAL SHORT WAVES WITH IT THAT WILL ROTATE SOUTH AND EAST 
ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS KEEPING SHOWERS IN THE 
FORECAST NE TN AND SW VA THROUGH THAT PERIOD. THE NW FLOW AROUND THE 
UPPER LOW WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL FOR A FEW DAYS BUT 
WARMING WILL TAKE PLACE BY THE END OF THE WEEK INTO SATURDAY. 
ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE AREA DEVELOPING OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
THURSDAY WILL MOVE SLOWLY NORTHEAST TOWARDS THE EASTERN TENNESSEE 
VALLEY FRIDAY. WILL INTRODUCE POPS BACK IN THE SOUTH SATURDAY AS 
THINK THE UPPER LOW WILL BE SLOW TO EXIT TO THE NORTHEAST AND THE 
NEXT SYSTEM WILL MOVE SLOWER.

STATIONARY JUST NORTH OF THE AREA...ACROSS SOUTHERN KY INTO SW
VA...WITH A TROUGH LOCATED TO OUR SOUTH ACROSS NRN AL/GA. THE 12Z
OHX SOUNDING MODIFIED TO 83/64 INDICATES THAT WE WILL NOT HAVE AS
MUCH INSTABILITY TO WORK WITH TODAY AS WE DID YESTERDAY...YIELDING
SBCAPES AROUND 1800 J/KG AND LI AROUND -7. THERE WILL BE SOME UPPER
DIVERGENCE TO HELP THINGS ALONG AS WE ARE IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF
A JET STREK OVER VA. WITH A DEEP SOUTHERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF IN THE
LOWER AND MID LEVELS RIDING INTO THE FRONT...AND VERY MOIST GROUND
IN THE PLATEAU COUNTIES...HEAVY RAIN AND FLOODING MAY BE THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL REMAIN 
OVER THE REGION TODAY. LOOKS LIKE THERE WILL BE CONSIDERABLE 
MOISTURE AND SIGNIFICANT INSTABILITY AGAIN TODAY...SO EXPECT ANOTHER 
ROUND OF CONVECTION.  WHILE POTENTIAL FOR SEVERE LOOKS A LITTLE LESS 
THAN YESTERDAY...SOME STORMS MAY BECOME SEVERE ONCE AGAIN WITH 
DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL THE MAIN THREATS.  WILL CARRY CHANCE 
POPS ALL BUT FAR NORTH TODAY INTO EARLY TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO MAIN ADJUSTMENT WILL BE A SLIGHT 
TWEAK UP FOR SOME LOCATIONS FOR HIGHS TODAY.     

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...ON SUNDAY SHORTWAVE ENERGY WILL 
SWING NORTHEAST FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY INTO THE MID SOUTH 
GENERATING THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE 
UNSTABLE AIR PROGGED ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. THE CHANCE FOR 
CONVECTION WILL INCREASE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS A DEEPENING 
UPPER TROF MAKES PROGRESS FROM THE PLAINS STATES INTO THE MIDWEST. A 
RELATIVELY STRONG SURFACE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM ASSOCIATED WITH THIS 
TROF WILL SHIFT EAST NORTHEAST FROM THE OZARKS THROUGH THE OHIO 
VALLEY. COOLER AND DRIER AIR WILL CLASH WITH MOIST/UNSTABLE AIR 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY 
REQUIRING THE USE OF LIKELY POPS FOR THUNDERSTORMS. MONDAY NIGHT 
INTO THURSDAY THE NOW CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL MAKE SLOW PROGRESS EAST 
ACROSS THE CORN BELT AND THEN APPEARS TO RETROGRADE A BIT. THIS 
LARGE CIRCULATION HAS SEVERAL SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES THAT WILL 
ROTATE SOUTH AND EAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
SO KEPT SOME SMALL AND SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS GOING THROUGH 
THIS PERIOD. WITH THE UPPER LOW DOMINATING MUCH OF THE NORTHEASTERN 
QUARTER OF THE NATION FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD...TEMPERATURES WILL BE 
BELOW NORMAL INITIALLY FOLLOWED BY A GRADUAL WARMING TREND WHEN THE 
CIRCULATION FINALLY DEPARTS TO THE EAST.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
MESOSCALE ANALYSIS OF SEVERE WEATHER PARAMETERS CONTINUE TO INDICATE 
A GOOD POTENTIAL FOR LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WIND GUSTS...WITH THE 
GREATEST POTENTIAL CENTERED OVER THE NORTHERN PLATEAU COUNTIES. THE 
MID LEVEL INVERSION IS LIKELY A BIT STRONGER OVER EAST TN THAN MIDDLE 
TN...SO CONVECTION WILL NEED AN ADDITIONAL PUSH TO GET MORE STORMS 
GOING...AND THIS PUSH WILL PROBABLY COME IN THE NEXT FEW HOURS FROM 
OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES PUT DOWN BY CONVECTION TO OUR WEST. HAIL LOOKS TO 
BE THE PRIMARY THREAT WITH SBCAPE AROUND 3000 J/KG...WBZ HEIGHTS 
AROUND 10.5 KFT...AND THE SHP AROUND 2. DYNAMIC LIFT WILL BE 
PROVIDED BY UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE ENTRANCE REGION OF A JET STREAK 
TO THE NORTHEAST...AND 700 MB FRONTOGENESIS. 

MODELS INDICATE THIS LIFT EXITING BY MIDNIGHT...AND WITH THE LOSS OF 
INSTABILITY AFTER SUNSET...STORMS SHOULD DISSIPATE BY MIDNIGHT. A 
MID LEVEL RIDGE AXIS WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA TONIGHT...WHILE AT THE 
SURFACE THE FRONT TO OUR NORTH WILL APPROACH AND STALL JUST TO OUR 
NORTH. A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH AND CONVERGENCE ZONE SETS UP ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN TN VALLEY...AND THIS SHOULD HELP FOCUS 
CONVECTION IN OUR SOUTHERN COUNTIES TOMORROW AFTERNOON. WHILE 
INSTABILITY AND SHEAR WILL NOT BE HIGH AS TODAY...THERE WILL BE 
POTENTIAL FOR SOME SEVERE STORMS IN THE PLATEAU AND IN THE SOUTHERN 
HALF. THE MAIN THREAT MAY BE DAMAGING WINDS AS FORECAST SOUNDINGS 
SHOW AN INVERTED-V PROFILE AT CHA. LARGE HAIL POTENTIAL LOOKS LOWER 
DUE TO HIGHER WBZ HEIGHTS AND LOWER CAPE. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS 
TOMORROW IN THE SOUTH...TAPERING TO A SLIGHT CHANCE IN SW VA.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT
STAYS JUST TO THE SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT. ON
GOING AFTERNOON SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS EXPECTED TO DIE OUT WITH

.DISCUSSION...
A FRONT IS LOCATED ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY THIS MORNING...AND WILL
PUSH SOUTH THROUGH THE DAY. THE AIRMASS AHEAD OF THIS FRONT HAS
PLENTY OF POTENTIAL TO SUPPORT SEVERE STROMS. OUTFLOW BOUNDARIES
FROM MORNING CONVECTION TO OUR NORTHWEST WILL LIKELY HELP INITIATE
THUNDERSTORMS EARLY THIS AFTERNOON. THE 12Z OHX SOUNDING MODIFIED
TO 85/66 YIELDS SBCAPE VALUES AROUND 3000 J/KG AND LI OF -10C.
ALTHOUGH LOW LEVEL WINDS ARE WEAK (REDUCING ANY TORNADO
POTENTIAL)...THE 0-6 KM BULK SHEAR OF 45 KTS WILL SUPPORT
SUPERCELLS. THE HIGH CAPE ALONG WITH WET-BULB ZERO HEIGHTS UNDER 11
KFT SUGGEST A LARGE HAIL THREAT. A SURFACE-TO- MIDLEVEL THETA-E
DIFFERENCE OF 25C AND MIDLEVEL DRY AIR IN FORECAST SOUNDINGS WILL
GIVE A THREAT OF DAMAGING WINDS. RUC AND NAM INDICATE A PERIOD OF
UPPER DIVERGENCE THIS AFTERNOON IN NORTHERN AREAS THAT WILL
ENHANCE LIFT.

THE MORNING UPDATE WILL RAISE POPS ACROSS THE NORTHERN AND WESTERN
SECTIONS TO LIKELY. TEMPERATURES WILL ALSO BE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY

SOUTHEAST INTO THE REGION DURING THE SHORT TERM. QUITE A BIT OF

INSTABILITY TODAY...SO SHOULD SEE SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS DEVELOP. MODEL SOUNDINGS SHOW WIND PROFILES ARE WEAK

HOWEVER...STILL APPEARS TO BE SOME SEVERE THREAT...MAINLY FOR

WILL CARRY A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS INTO THE EVENING 
HOURS...BUT LOOKS LIKE MOST OF THIS ACTIVITY SHOULD END BEFORE 
MIDNIGHT. MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...STAYED CLOSER TO ECMWF 
THROUGH THE PERIOD WHICH FEATURES A FRONTAL BOUNDARY THAT WILL 
MEANDER AROUND SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA ON 
SATURDAY. ATMOSPHERE PROGGED FOR SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY 
FOR SCATTERED CONVECTION SOUTH THROUGH THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU WHILE 
MORE WIDELY SEPARATED DEVELOPMENT OCCURS ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE 
AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA DUE TO EXPECTED GREATER DISTANCE FROM THE 
SYNOPTIC BOUNDARY. ON SUNDAY LONGWAVE TROF SHIFTS STEADILY EAST 
ACROSS THE PLAINS TOWARD THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY WHILE SHORTER 
WAVELENGTH ENERGY DRIVES NORTHEAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE 
LOWER OHIO VALLEY PULLING FRONTAL BOUNDARY NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA DURING THE DAY. KEPT POPS AT MEDIUM CHANCE FOR POSSIBLE 
SCATTERED CONVECTION THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT WHILE MAINTAINING LIKELY 
PROBABILITY OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR MONDAY AS LONGWAVE TROF DEEPENS AS 
IT MOVES INTO THE MIDWEST STATES. THIS WOULD APPEAR TO BE THE BEST 
PERIOD FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS MOISTURE ADVECTION INCREASES 
ALONG WITH CONVERGENCE AHEAD OF SYNOPTIC COLD FRONTAL BOUNDARY. 
GRADUALLY DROP POPS BACK MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY BUT STILL 
MAINTAIN MEDIUM CHANCE PROBABILITY FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS AS 
UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO DEEPEN AND SLOW DOWN OVER THE UPPER MIDWEST. 
NOT SURE JUST HOW LONG THIS FEATURE WILL AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA SO

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...
THE MID-UPPER LEVEL RIDGE AXIS THAT HAS SUPPRESSED CONVECTION OVER 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS IS MOVING TO THE EAST...ALLOWING FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS TO DEVELOP OVER MIDDLE TN AND KY THIS 
AFTERNOON. A FEW OF THESE SHOWERS MAY MOVE INTO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF 
OUR AREA...SO WILL INCLUDE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN THE NORTHWESTERN 
COUNTIES THIS EVENING. 

ON FRIDAY A FRONT TO OUR NORTH WILL PUSH FARTHER SOUTH ACROSS THE 
OHIO VALLEY...AND A PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH WILL HELP PROVIDE SOME FOCUS 
FOR SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS IN THE AFTERNOON. THE MIDLEVEL 
INVERSION THAT WE HAD IN PLACE TODAY WEAKENS TOMORROW...ALLOWING 
PLENTY OF INSTABILITY TO BE TAPPED. NAM AND GFS SHOW MLCAPE VALUES 
OF 1500-2000 J/KG...AND ALTHOUGH LOW LEVEL WINDS ARE LIGHT...0-6 KM 
SHEAR VALUES NEAR 40 KTS AND BULK RICHARDSON NUMBERS AROUND 20 
SUGGEST A POTENTIAL FOR SUPERCELLS. THE MAIN THREAT LOOKS TO BE HAIL 
GIVEN THE HIGH CAPE VALUES...AND DAMAGING WIND GUSTS AS SURFACE TO 
MIDLEVEL THETA-E DIFFERENCES ARE AROUND 25 DEGREES AND STEEP LOW 
LEVEL LAPSE RATES. LIMITING FACTORS WILL BE THE LACK OF LARGE-SCALE 
FORCING AS THE UPPER JET AND THE SURFACE FRONT WILL BE POSITIONED 
WELL TO THE NORTH. THIS AND THE LIMITED AMOUNT OF MOISTURE SHOULD 
MEAN THAT THE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE MAINLY DIURNAL...SO WILL REMOVE 
ALL POPS FROM THE AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...COLD FRONT JUST SOUTH OF
FORECAST AREA SATURDAY MORNING BUT MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY STILL
HIGH WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS SOUTHERN SECTIONS
AND A SLIGHT CHANCE NORTH. STILL LOOKS FAVORABLE FOR A FEW SEVERE
THUNDERSTORMS. BEST CHANCE THOUGH SOUTH OF THE TN BORDER. ACTIVITY
SHOULD BE MAINLY DIURNAL. INCREASING CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY AS NEW LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES
EAST FROM THE SOUTHERN PLAINS SUNDAY MORNING INTO THE SOUTHERN
GREAT LAKES BY TUESDAY MORNING. THE FRONT TO THE SOUTH SHOULD MOVE
BACK NORTH AS A WARM FRONT AND THEN THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE
THROUGH MONDAY NITH AND EARLY TUESDAY. HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN
FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. HAVE HIGHEST POPS MONDAY THROUGH
TUESDAY WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE TUESDAY NIGHT. WARM AND HUMID SATURDAY
AND SUNDAY WITH COOLER TEMPERATURES MONDAY AND TUESDAY WITH MORE
CLOUDS AND RAIN. MUCH COOLER NIGHTS BEHIND SECOND FRONT TUESDAY

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RIDGE BUILDS INTO THE AREA 
BRINGING MOSTLY DRY AND WARM WEATHER TODAY.  WITH INSTABILITY 
INCREASING THIS AFTERNOON...MAY STILL SEE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS 
DEVELOPING....WILL KEEP LOW POPS FOR THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING

NUMBERS FOR TEMPERATURES LOOKED REASONABLE SO DIDN'T STRAY TOO FAR.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...GFS AND ECMWF MODELS REVEAL 
SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THE PROGRESSION OF A COLD FRONT FOR THIS 
WEEKEND...BUT THE GFS MODEL SEEMS TO NOW BE TRENDING CLOSER TO THE 
MORE CONSISTENT ECMWF SOLUTION. OVERALL...AN ACTIVE PATTERN IS 
EXPECTED TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...AS A COLD 
FRONT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. A MODERATELY UNSTABLE AIR MASS 
IS PROGGED TO DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...WHICH WILL 
LIKELY RESULT IN A GOOD CHANCE FOR SEVERE TSTORMS BY THE AFTERNOON 
AND EVENING HOURS. ECMWF MODEL INDICATES THAT THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
WILL BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY FOR THE 
WEEKEND...WHICH SEEMS REALISTIC GIVEN THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW 
BECOMES ZONAL AND WILL NOT PROVIDE MUCH OF A PUSH FOR THIS FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY TO MOVE FURTHER SOUTH. AS A RESULT...EXPECT SCATTERED 
CONVECTION TO DEVELOP EACH DAY THROUGH THE WEEKEND WITH AN UNSTABLE 
AIR MASS REMAINING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH IS 
THEN PROGGED TO STRENGTHEN OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY SUNDAY NIGHT... 
CREATING A SURFACE LOW THAT TRACKS ACROSS THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON 
MONDAY. THUS...WILL PLAN TO INCREASE POPS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY 
NIGHT...WITH A FEW WRAP-AROUND SHOWERS POSSIBLE ON TUESDAY ON THE 
BACK SIDE OF THIS LOW. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND A LITTLE COOLER

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...A RIDGE AXIS EXTENDING FROM 
HIGH PRESSURE THAT IS CENTERED OVER FLORIDA TODAY WILL BE BUILDING 
INTO OUR AREA TONIGHT AND TOMORROW. A BAND OF LIGHT RAIN TRAILING 
THE MCS OVER WV MAY CROSS OUR NORTHERN COUNTIES THIS EVENING. ONCE 
THIS PASSES WE SHOULD SEE CLEARING SKIES AS SUBSIDENCE ALOFT 
INCREASES WITH THE BUILDING RIDGE AXIS. IF CLOUDS CAN CLEAR QUICKLY 
ENOUGH...THERE COULD BE SOME PATCHY FOG IN AREAS THAT SAW SHOWERS 
TODAY. 

FORECAST SOUNDINGS FOR TOMORROW SHOW A STRONG MIDLEVEL 
INVERSION...STRONGER IN THE SOUTH THAN THE NORTH...AS A RESULT OF 
THE RIDGING ALOFT. THIS SHOULD KEEP A CAP ON MOST CONVECTION 
TOMORROW AS THERE IS VERY LITTLE FORCING TO OVERCOME THE STRONG CAP. 
BUT THE NAM DOES INDICATE SOME LOW LEVEL CONFLUENCE IN NORTHERN 
AREAS WHERE THE CAP IS WEAKER...AND THERE COULD BE SOME LINGERING 
BOUNDARIES IN THAT AREA FROM TODAY'S ACTTIVITY TO THE NORTH...SO 
WILL INCLUDE A LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP NORTH AND IN THE 
MOUNTAINS/PLATEAU TOMORROW AFTERNOON. NAM MLCAPE RISES TO OVER 2000 
J/KG TOMORROW...BUT THE LACK OF DYNAMIC FORCING AND SHEAR WILL 
PREVENT ANY ORGANIZED SEVERE. HIGHS WILL BE QUITE WARM UNDER THE 
RIDGE...REACHING BETWEEN 85 AND 90 IN MOST LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE 
MOUNTAINS. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS IN POOR 
AGREEMENT ON POSITION/TRACK OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT...BUT 
OVERALL...BELIEVE WEATHER PATTERN WILL BE UNSETTLED THROUGH MUCH OF 
THE EXTENDED.  MAIN QUESTION THROUGH THE EXTENDED IS...WILL THE 
APPROACHING FRONTAL BOUNDARY STALL AROUND THE MRX CWA OR WILL IT 
PUSH THROUGH TO OUR SOUTH THIS WEEKEND.  CONVECTION IS EXPECTED TO 
DEVELOP AND MOVE ALONG THE FRONT EACH DAY.  HAVE GONE WITH A 
COMPROMISE OF THE MODELS AND HAVE POPS RANGING FROM 20 TO 40 FROM 
FRIDAY AFTERNOON THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  ANOTHER COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
IN ON MONDAY WITH ASSOCIATED CONVECTION LINGERING INTO TUESDAY.  
WILL KEEP THINGS DRY ON WEDNESDAY BEHIND THE FRONT.

THEN SETTLE INTO THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...RESULTING IN A BETTER 
COVERAGE OF CONVECTION. THE LOCAL AIR MASS IS AGAIN PROGGED TO 
BECOME MODERATELY UNSTABLE BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS...SO THINK THAT AN 
OUTBREAK OF SEVERE WEATHER MAY BE POSSIBLE. ECMWF MODEL INDICATES 
THAT THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WILL BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY OVER THE TN

FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHEAST FROM IT ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. THIS LOW IS 
PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES REGION BY THIS

INSTABILITY DEVELOPING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA BY THIS AFTERNOON... 
SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A MENTION OF THUNDER FOR TODAY. MODELS 
INDICATE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL THEN MOVE ACROSS THE TN 
RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT...SO WILL MAINTAIN CHANCE POPS FOR ADDITIONAL 
CONVECTION THROUGH TONIGHT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH THEIR MAXES FOR TODAY... 
MAINLY DUE TO DIFFERENCES IN THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER EXPECTED. 
SINCE THE AMOUNT OF CLOUD COVER WILL BE HIGHLY DEPENDENT ON UPSTREAM

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ISENTROPIC ASCENT WILL 
CONTINUE TONIGHT ACROSS THE REGION. THE WARMER MOIST SOUTHWEST FLOW 
SHOULD YIELD A FEW LIGHT SHOWERS IN SPOTS. DRIER LOWER LEVELS NEED 
TO BE OVERCOME TO GET DECENT WIDESPREAD COVERAGE. DIFFICULT 
DETERMINING IF EVERYONE GETS A HUNDREDTH OF AN INCH IN THIS LIGHT 
RAIN EVENT. DECIDED TO PLAY THE POPS A LITTLE LOWER WITH MAIN LIFT 
SHIFTING STEADILY EAST FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS ALONG WITH THE LOSS 
OF INSOLATION. WARM AIR ADVECTION PATTERN KEEPS RIGHT ON GOING ON 
TUESDAY AND THE ATMOSPHERE PROGGED TO BECOME LESS STABLE THAN WHAT 
WE ARE EXPERIENCING TODAY. SO USED SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR MY 
PRECIP TYPE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. STAYED WITH THE TREND OF 
HIGHER POPS NORTH CLOSER TO THE DEEPER MOISTURE AND LIFT IN THE WARM 
AIR ADVECTION PATTERN. SURFACE WAVE WILL DRAG A COOL FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY AND A LITTLE BIT OF MODEL DISAGREEMENT 
HOW FAR SOUTH THE FRONT WILL PROGRESS...SO HIGHER POP NORTH AND WEST 
NOT A BAD IDEA. MODELS INDICATE THE POSSIBILITY OF A WEAK SHORT WAVE 
TRANSITING THROUGH THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY EARLY WEDNESDAY WITH 
MOVEMENT TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS BY AFTERNOON SO USED A 
GRADATION OF HIGHER CHANCE POPS NORTH THROUGH LOWER CHANCE SOUTH FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WITH BOUNDARY IN PLACE AND SHORT WAVE 
MOVING ACROSS THE MID SOUTH. STAYED QUITE CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE BLEND 
CONCERNING TEMPS DURING THE SHORT TERM. 

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...RIDGING EXTENDS 
NORTHWARD FROM THE EAST GLFMEX INTO THE S APPALACHIANS THURSDAY. 
WARM TEMPS WITH CHANCE OF AFTN CONVECTION OVER THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. NORTH END OF RIDGE FLATTENS AS FRONT MOVES SE INTO THE 
AREA FRI. CHANCE OF SHOWERS IMPROVES INTO FRI NGT. RIDGE BUILDS IN 
ON SAT. LEFT CHANCE POPS GOING S AREAS ALLOWING FOR FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
TO LINGER EARLY SAT. NOT MUCH OF A COOL DOWN WITH THIS WESTERN

THIRDS OF THE REGION BY LATE AFTERNOON. EVAPORATION ACROSS PARTS OF

TUESDAY.  AS SHORT-WAVE MOVES TO THE MID-ATLANTIC STATES BY 
WEDNESDAY MORNING...A COLD FRONT WILL MOVE TOWARD THE NORTHERN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE
CONTINUE TO DOMINATE OUR AREA'S WEATHER...WITH SOME PATCHY AREAS OF
FROST POSSIBLE OVER SW VA AND NRN PARTS OF EAST TN LATE TONIGHT.
HOWEVER...EXPECT AT LEAST PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES WITH SOME WARMING
ALOFT AS WELL. THUS...I DON'T SEE AN IDEAL SET UP FOR A WIDESPREAD
FROST... WITH BEST AREAS FOR FROST TO BE SHELTERED VALLEYS WHERE
WINDS DECOUPLE THE MOST. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE FROM THE SOUTHWEST
BUT A DRY FORECAST OVERNIGHT.

FOR MONDAY...A WEAK SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW DOES DEVELOP BUT I DID
NOT SEE MUCH OF A FOCUS FOR CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION. OPTED TO KEEP
POPS OUT OF NE TN AND SW VA THROUGH MONDAY AFTERNOON AND ALSO TO
STAY A BIT BELOW THE HIGHER NAM-WRF MOS POPS.

GENERALLY WENT WITH A BLEND OF MOS FOR MIN AND MAX TEMPS. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SURFACE RIDGE OF HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BE EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WITH BOUNDARY LAYER 
SOUTHERLY FLOW PULLING A WARM FRONT ACROSS THE NORTHERN THIRD OF THE 
FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT. PLENTY OF POTENTIAL INSTABILITY 
TUESDAY...BUT ONLY FORCING SEEMS TO BE OROGRAPHIC. WILL CALL FOR 
CHANCE AND LOW CHANCE POPS.

FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY...STATIONARY FRONT WILL BE OVER 
THE LOWER OHIO VALLEY. THERE MAY BE A MCS THAT DEVELOPS ACROSS 
SOUTHERN IL/IN THEN RIDE EAST-SOUTHEAST INTO THE NORTHERN THIRD OF 
THE FORECAST AREA.

RIDGING SURFACE AND ALOFT BUILDS BACK INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT...SO VERY WARM AND MUGGY 
AIR. WILL LIKELY SEE WIDELY SCATTERED OROGRAPHIC CONVECTION DURING 
THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

FOR FRIDAY...ANOTHER FRONT DIPS INTO THE FORECAST AREA PRODUCING 
SCATTERED-BROKEN CONVECTION. THIS FRONT REMAINS QUASI-STATIONARY 
ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THROUGH SUNDAY.

SEVERE CHANCES POSSIBLE THROUGH THE EXTENDED AS FRONT MOVES BACK AND 
FORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...POST FRONTAL LOW CLOUDS 
CONTINUE TO DROP SLOWLY SOUTH FROM THE OHIO VALLEY AND CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON...WHILE SUNNY SKIES DOMINATE OUR AREA.

AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES STAYING MOSTLY ABOVE 30 PERCENT...AND WHERE A 
FEW SPOTS HAVE DIPPED BELOW 30 PERCENT...WE FIND WIND SPEEDS WELL 
BELOW RED FLAG WARNING LEVELS. IN FACT...OVERALL WINDS HAVE NOT BEEN 
AS BRISK AS EXPECTED. 

TURNING ATTENTION TO NEXT ITEM OF CONCERN...PATCHY FROST POSSIBLE 
OVER NRN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. I EXPECT SOME OF THE 
LOW CLOUDS TO ADVECT INTO SW VA AND NE TN...AND ALSO WIND SPEEDS 
LOOK TO STAY UP AS WELL. THUS...I SEE NO REASON FOR A FROST ADVISORY
...CHOOSING TO MENTION PATCHY FROST POSSIBLE IN ANY AREA WHERE MINS 
MAY FALL JUST BELOW 40 DEGREES. 

RIDGING ALOFT AND AT THE SURFACE SHOULD KEEP US DRY INTO MONDAY...
AND I DID REMOVE THE LOW POPS FOR LATE SUNDAY NIGHT FOR OUR 
SEQUATCHIE VALLEY COUNTIES. SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW RETURNS ON 
MONDAY...WITH MODELS GENERATING A WIDE SWATH OF CONVECTIVE 
PRECIPITATION (PCPN) IN ASSOCIATION WITH A DEVELOPING WARM FRONT.
THIS WARRANTS LOW POPS FOR SRN AND WRN COUNTIES OF EAST TN BY MONDAY 
AFTERNOON. 

OTHERWISE...MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS WERE QUITE CLOSE FOR ALL 4 PERIODS 
AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...GFS/ECMWF FAIRLY CLOSE 
THROUGHOUT THE LONG TERM DEPICTING INITIAL SHORTWAVE'S PATH EAST 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES WHILE 
WEAKENING. IT MAY AID IN THE DEVELOPMENT OF SOME WARM AIR ADVECTION 
SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT INTO EARLY TUESDAY IN ASSOCIATION WITH SURFACE 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. SURFACE LOW SHIFTS EAST ACROSS THE EASTERN 
LAKES WHILE DRAGGING SUFACE BOUNDARY SOUTH ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY. USED SOME MEDIUM CHANCE 
POPS FOR POSSIBLE WARM FRONTAL SHOWERS/THUNDERSTORMS MONDAY NIGHT 
THEN DROP POPS A BIT FOR TUESDAY INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION COMES UNDER THE INFLUENCE OF SYSTEM WARM SECTOR. 
THEN RAISED POPS ON WEDNESDAY INTO LOW CHANCE RANGE AS THE COOL 
FRONT DROPS SOUTH TOWARD THE REGION. DIMINISHED THE PROBABILITY OF 
PRECIPITATION AGAIN FOR THURSDAY AWAITING APPROACH OF NEXT SHORT 
WAVE TROF WHICH PRESSES EAST NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES ON 
FRIDAY. SURFACE WAVE WILL BUILD EAST ON A SIMILAR TRACK TAKEN BY THE 
EARLIER WEEK SYSTEM. STAYED WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS IN ANTICIPATION OF THIS LATE WEEK SYSTEM WHICH MAY NOT 
IMPACT THE REGION UNTIL SATURDAY AS SURFACE BOUNDARY SLIPS INTO THE 
SOUTHEASTERN U.S.

TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT PRODUCING BREEZY WESTERLY WINDS TODAY. IT 
APPEARS THAT THESE WINDS SHOULD REMAIN BELOW THE WIND ADVISORY

.DISCUSSION...LOW PRESSURE AREA OVER LAKE ERIE AND NORTHERN OHIO
WITH COLD FRONT STRETCHING TO THE SW ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO
THE LOWER MS VALLEY WILL MAKE EASTWARD PROGRESS TONIGHT AND REACH
THE FORECAST AREA AROUND 6Z AND BE OUT OF THE REGION AROUND 12Z.
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS HAVE FIRED AHEAD OF THE FRONT FROM
SOUTHERN IN ACROSS WESTERN KY INTO NW TN. AHEAD OF THOSE STORMS A
NEW LINE HAS FORMED FROM SOUTH CENTRAL KY INTO NORTHERN MIDDLE TN.
EXPECT THIS LINE TO STRENGTHEN LATER TONIGHT AS THE FRONT MOVES
EAST. STILL LOOKS LIKE SCATTERED SHOWERS AND POSSIBLY A THUNDERSTORM
WILL FORM BETWEEN 6 AND 12Z. LATEST MODEL RUNS SHOW INSTABILITY
RAPIDLY WEAKENING BETWEEN NOW AND 6Z. RAINFALL AMOUNTS LOOK TO BE
LIGHT. UPDATE OUT SOON TO CHANGE WORDING TO ISOLATED THUNDER AND
LOWER INITIAL POPS SLIGHTLY.

257 PM EDT FRI MAY 7 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...WARM FRONT IS WELL NOTED ON 
LATEST SURFACE MAPS...LYING FROM ALONG A TYS TO CSV LINE NORTHWARD 
TO NEAR LEXINGTON KY. CONVECTIVE TEMPERATURE IS BEING REACHED ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA WITH SOME FLAT CUMULUS CLOUDS DEVELOPING. AREAS 
NEAR THE WARM FRONT HAVE POSITIVE CAPE UP TO 1500 J/KG. HOWEVER...
AREA RADARS LOOK AWFULLY ECHO FREE UPSTREAM...SUCH THAT HAVING OUR 
EVENING HOURS RAINFREE SHOULD WORK. THE WARM AIR ALOFT SHOULD 
CONTINUE TO SUPPRESS CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT UNTIL THE FRONT 
APPROACHES.

WILL LIMIT PRECIPITATION TO AFTER MIDNIGHT AND ENDING IN THE WESTERN 
AREAS BEFORE DAYBREAK SATURDAY. THE UPPER LOW AND SUPPORT ALOFT IS 
SO FAR TO OUR NORTH...AND THE CONVECTION ARRIVES SO LATE...THAT 
SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS ARE PROBABLY ALL WE WILL 
SEE WITH THIS SYSTEM. PREVIOUS POP AND WX GRIDS WERE CLOSELY 
FOLLOWED WITH JUST A FEW TWEAKS. 

SHOULD BE ON THE BREEZY SIDE SATURDAY AFTER FRONTAL PASSAGE...BUT FOR
NOW KEPT WIND SPEEDS BELOW ADVISORY CRITERIA...WITH SOME GUSTS AS 
HIGH AS 35 MPH. MIN RH VALUES SATURDAY AFTERNOON WOULD APPEAR TO RUN 
ABOUT 5 PERCENT ABOVE CRITICAL VALUES FOR SW VA AND SW NC FIRE 
DISTRICTS...WITH SPEEDS ALSO NEAR CRITERIA FOR A RED FLAG WARNING.
HOWEVER...WET WEATHER FROM PAST WEEKEND AND ANY RAIN OVERNIGHT 
SHOULD HELP...SO WILL PASS THIS CONCERN ON TO THE FOLLOWING SHIFTS.  

OTHERWISE...NEXT CONCERN IS FOR SATURDAY NIGHT WITH COLDER TEMPS 
BROUGHT IN WITH THE NORTHERLY FLOW. MIN TEMPS FALL ENOUGH FOR SOME 
PATCHY FROST ACROSS SW VA AND SOME OTHER HIGH TERRAIN...BUT GRADIENT 
AND WINDS ALOFT SHOULD KEEP A NORTH WIND OF 5 TO 15 MPH. THIS SHOULD
PREVENT FROST FROM FORMING. 

MOS GUIDANCE WAS CLOSE AND REASONABLE FOR ALL BUT SATURDAY HIGHS. 
FOR SATURDAY MAX TEMPS I WENT FOR A BLEND CLOSER TO THE MILDER GFS 
NUMBERS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...MODELS RELATIVELY CLOSE 
THROUGH MID WEEK WITH SOLUTIONS DIVERGING BY THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. 
STAYED CLOSER TO THE ECMWF FOR THIS PACKAGE. THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE 
GRADUALLY MOISTENING ON RETURN SOUTHERLY FLOW SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH 
THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK AS ANOTHER UPPER LEVEL TROF SWINGS NORTHEAST 
FROM THE DESERT SOUTHWEST TOWARD THE MIDWEST. SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
MOVES NORTHEAST FROM THE CENTRAL ROCKIES MONDAY INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
STATES BY 12Z WEDNESDAY. LEFT SLIGHT AND CHANCE VARIETY POPS FOR 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS THROUGH THURSDAY AS THE FORECAST AREA WILL 
BE IN THE WAA PATTERN AHEAD OF THE STORM SYSTEM EARLY IN THE WEEK 
AND THEN SYSTEM COOL FRONT WILL DROP INTO THE NORTHERN PART OF THE 
VIEWING AREA LATER WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. KEPT POPS OUT OF THE 
FORECAST FOR THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE UPPER LEVEL 
HEIGHT PATTERN AMPLIFIES AGAIN WITH THE APPROACH OF ANOTHER SHORT 
WAVE TROF WHICH IS PROGGED TO BUILD NORTHEAST INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
KEEPING ANY CHANCE OF RAIN RATHER LOW ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION.

THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE RELATIVELY DRY INITIALLY. THE SOUTHERLY FLOW
WILL REMAIN A LITTLE STRONGER THAN USUAL AS THE PRESSURE GRADIENT
WILL BE TIGHT AHEAD OF MIDWEST COLD FRONT DUE AT THE TAF SITES

BUT THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SHOULD SEE SOME CUMULUS
CEILINGS. USED A VCTS FOR WIDELY SCATTERED TO POSSIBLE SCATTERED

.DISCUSSION...GENERALLY CLEAR SKIES WITH MILD TEMPS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING. LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW HAS RETURNED TO 
WESTERN PARTS WITH DEW POINT TEMPS AS HIGH AS THE LOWER 60S...ALTHO 
TO THE NE ACROSS SW VA DEW POINT TEMPS REMAIN IN THE 40S TO LOWER 
50S. MODIFIED 12Z OHX SOUNDING SHOWS GOOD INSTABILITY BUT A STRONG 
MID LEVEL CAPPING SUBSIDENCE INVERSION...WHILE A MODIFIED 12Z RNK 
SOUNDING DID NOT OFFER MUCH INSTABILITY WITH A WEAKER CAP. 

THUS...DON'T EXPECT MUCH CONVECTION IN ADVANCE OF THE COLD FRONT...
BUT WILL KEEP MINIMAL POPS FOR THE MTN AREAS. YESTERDAY CONVECTION 
WAS CONFINED TO THE HIGH TERRAIN WELL TO OUR SOUTHEAST ALONG THE 
NC-SC STATELINE (GSP AREA).  

MAX TEMP FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK...AND A FEW SPOTS MAY GET CLOSE TO 
A RECORD HIGH. HOWEVER...RECORD HIGHS FOR CHA AND TYS (94/92) WILL BE
OUT OF REACH. THUS...WON'T ADD RECORD HIGH WORDING TO ANY ZONE 
GROUPS.

FORECAST GRIDS WOULD NOT APPEAR TO REQUIRE AN UPDATE THIS MORNING...
BUT I MAY UPDATE THE ZFPMRX TO REMOVE AFTERNOON WORDING FROM MTN 
GROUPS.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY LOCATED BETWEEN KNOXVILLE AND THE 
TRI-CITIES...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER THE CENTRAL 
PLAINS. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEAST INTO 
THE GREAT LAKES REGION TODAY...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVING 
ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT. A STRONG SOUTHERLY WIND FLOW 
AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL PUSH THE LOCAL STALLED FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
NORTHWARD INTO THE MID ATLANTIC STATES BY THIS AFTERNOON. THESE 
SOUTHERLY WINDS WILL BECOME FAIRLY BREEZY AREAWIDE BY THIS 
AFTERNOON...BUT SHOULD REMAIN BELOW THE ADVISORY THRESHOLD OF 25 MPH 
SUSTAINED WINDS. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A FAIRLY DRY AIR MASS OVER 
THE REGION TODAY...BUT WILL PLAN TO MENTION ISOLATED AFTERNOON 
CONVECTION ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW MAY HELP TO 
TRIGGER A FEW TSTORMS (SIMILAR TO YESTERDAY). MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA 
AFTER MIDNIGHT TONIGHT...WITH ENOUGH MOISTURE FOR SOME SCATTERED 
CONVECTION. IF THIS CONVECTION STAYS AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT...MODEL 
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT AN INVERTED-V VERTICAL TEMP PROFILE MAY 
CREATE SOME STRONG GUSTY WINDS WITH A FEW STORMS. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT FOR TODAY...BUT REVEAL SOME 
DISCREPANCIES FOR TONIGHT. WILL PLAN TO FORECAST MAXES TO BE A FEW 
DEGREES WARMER TODAY (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY)...AND WILL TREND CLOSER 
TO THE COOLER NAM NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...FRONT PULLS AWAY FROM 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION EARLY SATURDAY TAKING PRECIP WITH IT... 
BUT USHERING IN SIGNIFICANTLY COOLER AIR. BOUNDARY RETURNS AS WARM 
FRONT BY MONDAY WITH AN ASSOCIATED INCREASE IN POPS THROUGH THE DAY. 
PRECIP SHIFTS NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA BY TUESDAY AS WEAK UPPER 
RIDGING PUSHES WARM FRONT TO THE NORTH. HOWEVER...BOUNDARY LURKS 
CLOSE ENOUGH TO KEEP THINGS POTENTIALLY UNSETTLED THROUGH MID WEEK 
BEFORE UPPER RIDGE AMPLIFIES PUSHING FRONT EVEN FARTHER NORTH BY 
LATE WEEK. DID KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR DAYTIME PERIODS LATE IN 
THE LONG TERM TO ACCOUNT FOR POTENTIAL DIURNAL CONVECTION IN WARM 
SECTOR. TEMPS ARE EXPECTED TO RECOVER FROM WELL BELOW CLIMO EARLY IN 
THE LONG TERM TO A RETURN TO ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS BY MID WEEK. 
GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.DISCUSSION...
THE CURRENT FORECAST OF MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LOWS IN THE 50S TO
LOWER 60S APPEARS TO BE ON TRACK...SO NO UPDATE WILL BE NEEDED. A
FRONT IS POSITIONED ACROSS THE AREA...DEFINED BY A DEWPOINT
GRADIENT STRETCHING FROM NEAR STL TO BETWEEN TYS AND TRI...BUT WITH
THE LACK OF MOISTURE AND A MIDLEVEL RIDGE IT WILL HAVE LITTLE
IMPACT ON OUR WEATHER OVERNIGHT. AS THE RIDGE ALOFT SHIFTS EAST...A
STRONGER SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL PUSH THE FRONT BACK TO THE NORTH
AND TRANSPORT GREATER MOISTURE INTO THE AREA TOMORROW.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...WEAK COLD FRONT APPEARS TO 
HAVE PASSED SE THROUGH THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...
WITH LITTLE IF ANY EFFECTS OTHER THAN A SLIGHT DROP IN DEW POINT 
TEMPS. SOME FLAT CUMULUS CLOUDS OVER MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS...
BUT THIS SHOULD DISSIPATE THIS EVENING AND GIVE WAY TO MOSTLY CLEAR 
SKIES OVERNIGHT. TYS WAS ONE OF THE MILDER MIN TEMP SPOTS LAST
NIGHT DUE TO A LIGHT SW WIND...WHICH SHOULD BE ABSENT TONIGHT.
OPTED TO GO CLOSE TO THE REASONABLE MOS MINS.

DON'T FORESEE MUCH CHANGE FOR FRIDAY FROM TODAY...AS DRY AND WARM 
WEATHER LINGERS. SHOULD SEE A SLIGHT INCREASE IN DAYTIME CUMULUS 
CLOUDS AND SOME SPOTS GETTING CLOSE TO RECORD HIGHS (WHICH ARE 
MOSTLY UPPER 80S TO LOWER 90S).

MODEL CONSENSUS WAS TO DELAY CONVECTION UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT FRIDAY 
NIGHT...WITH BEST CHANCES RUNNING FROM 06Z TO JUST AFTER 12Z 
SATURDAY. CHANCE POPS WITH AREAL SCATTERED QUALIFIER LOOKED GOOD
WITH DEFINITELY A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS IN ORDER. HOWEVER...
I WOULD NOT BE SURPRISED TO SEE MUCH LESS THAN A SOLID LINE OF WEAK 
CONVECTION WITH THIS FRONT. RAIN CHANCES DROP OUT AFTER SATURDAY 
MORNING...FOLLOWED BY CLEARING SKIES...COOLER TEMPS AND BREEZY 
CONDITIONS. GENERALLY FOLLOWED MOS NUMBERS FOR LOWS FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
HIGHS SATURDAY.


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...WAS ABLE TO KEEP THE 
FIRST DAY AND A HALF...SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY...FREE OF PROBABILITY 
OF PRECIPITATION AS DRY ADVECTION AND SURFACE RIDGINS KEEP THE 
THREAT OF RAIN AWAY. HOWEVER...WAS FORCED TO ADD A POP IN THROUGH 
ABOUT MID WEEK AS ATMOSPHERE MOISTENS AND DESTABILIZES A BIT. BEST 
LIFTING APPEARS TO BE CENTERED AROUND MONDAY AND TUESDAY AS WARM 
FRONT WILL BE MAKING PROGRESS NORTH ACROSS THE MID SOUTH AS UPPER 
TROF AMPLIFIES OVER THE PLAINS STATES. THIS WILL DRIVE A SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM NORTHEAST FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE GREAT LAKES. BY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SHOULD 
BE IN THE WARM SECTOR WITH ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE OF CONVECTION IN THE 
MAJOR TERRAIN AREAS. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS PACKAGE TEMP 
FORECAST WITH MINOR TWEAKS TOWARD NEW MOS GUIDANCE.

318 PM EDT WED MAY 5 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THESE PERIODS LOOK TO
REMAIN DRY AND WARM WITH A CHANCE EACH DAY (ALTHOUGH BETTER REGION
WIDE ON FRIDAY) OF REACHING OR EXCEEDING RECORD MAX TEMPS. (THU -
CHA 94... TYS 87...TRI 88 AND OQT 92) THEN (FRI - CHA 94...TYS
92...TRI 87 AND OQT 88).

ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AMPLIFIES ON THURSDAY THEN FLATTENS BY FRIDAY NIGHT 
AS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS EAST FROM THE UPPER MS VALLEY 
THROUGH THE GREAT LAKES REGION. THE ASSOCIATED TRAILING COLD FRONT
MAY BRING SCATTERED SHOWERS AND ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY
NIGHT. PRIOR TO THIS SYSTEM A WEAK COLD FRONT WILL MOVE SE ACROSS
THE OHIO VALLEY EARLY THURSDAY AND MAY DRIFT THROUGH THE SRN
APPALACHIANS BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING. DON'T SEE MUCH
MOISTURE WITH THIS FRONT...SO OPTED TO KEEP THESE FIRST 4 PERIODS
DRY FOR NOW.

MOS MAX TEMPS GENERALLY CLOSE AND FOLLOWED. MIN TEMP GUIDANCE FOR 
TONIGHT LOOKS A LITTLE MILD GIVEN THE CLEAR SKIES...DRY AIRMASS AND 
VERY LIGHT WINDS...SO WENT A DEGREE OR TWO BELOW GFS MOS FOR TONIGHT.
A BLEND OF MOS MINS LOOKED GOOD FOR THURSDAY NIGHT.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...AN AREA OF LOW
PRESSURE TRACKS TO THE NORTH OF THE CWA ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND
SATURDAY WITH A COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH IT TRACKS SOUTH INTO THE
CWA ON FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY MORNING. WILL KEEP THE CHANCE
POPS FOR BOTH PERIODS WITH THE HIGHER CHANCES IN THE NORTH NEARER
THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE. DRY WEATHER RETURNS BRIEFLY BEFORE A WARM
FRONT PUSHED INTO THE AREA ON MONDAY AND LINGERS INTO TUESDAY. WITH
STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING...WILL KEEP ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE
POPS FOR NOW. A FEW TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND THE
GFS ON WEDNESDAY. WILL GO WITH THE DRIER GFS AND KEEP WEDNESDAY DRY
FOR NOW. STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.DISCUSSION...ABUNDANT SUNSHINE ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING WITH 
A WARM AND DRY AIRMASS IN PLACE. PREVIOUS FORECAST APPEARS TO BE ON 
TRACK AS 12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS SUPPORT DEEP MIXING THIS AFTERNOON...
ALLOWING HIGHS TO TOP OUT IN THE 70S TO MID OR UPPER 80S. 

THE CURRENT RECORD HIGHS FOR THIS DATE FOLLOW:

TRI 87 (1959 & 1955) - FORECAST HIGH 83
TYS 92 (1902) - FORECAST HIGH 85
CHA 90 (1955 & 1949) - FORECAST HIGH 88

SO IT IS POSSIBLE THAT A FEW SPOTS MAY GET CLOSE TO SETTING A RECORD 
HIGH TEMPERATURE. OTHER THAN A TWEAK OF HOURLY CONDITIONS AND 
AFFECTED PRODUCTS...NO UPDATE IS PLANNED AT THIS TIME.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
CONTINUE TO PROVIDE TRANQUIL WEATHER CONDITIONS THROUGH THE SHORT 
TERM. FLOW ALOFT WILL REMAIN NEARLY ZONAL WHICH WILL ALLOW GOOD 
WARMING OF THE BOUNDARY LAYER UNDER STRONG MAY SOLAR INSOLATION... 
RESULTING IN ANTICIPATED WELL-ABOVE-CLIMO MAX TEMPS ON WEDNESDAY. 
DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV GUIDANCE VALUES AS THEY SEEM 
REASONABLE GIVEN EXPECTED SCENARIO.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A RIDGE WILL BE BUILDING OVER THE SOUTHEAST CONUS THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT. THIS SHOULD HELP SUPPRESS CONVECTION THURSDAY AFTERNOON 
DESPITE PLENTY OF SURFACE HEATING. THERE COULD BE AN ISOLATED SHOWER 
IN THE MOUNTAINS...BUT CHANCES APPEAR TOO SMALL TO MENTION IN THE 
FORECAST AT THIS TIME. 

ONCE THE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS EAST ON FRIDAY...A SW FLOW WILL ADVECT 
SOME LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO THE AREA AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD 
FRONT. INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THE FRONT SHOULD RESULT IN ISOLATED 
SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FRIDAY AFTERNOON...THEN WILL RAISE POPS TO 
A CHANCE FRIDAY NIGHT WITH THE FROPA. LIFT IS NOT VERY STRONG WITH 
THE FRONT AS THE UPPER LEVEL FLOW REMAINS NEARLY ZONAL AND THE UPPER 
JET STAYS WELL TO THE NORTH. HOWEVER THERE IS A GOOD PUSH OF A COLD 
AIR MASS IN THE LOW LEVELS BEHIND THE FRONT...WHICH WILL BRING 
COOLER TEMPS FOR THE WEEKEND. LOW TEMPS COULD DROP INTO THE 30S 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY NIGHT IN SOME SPOTS...WITH HIGHS IN THE 
MID 60S TO LOWER 70S.

LOW PRESSURE THAT DEVELOPS IN THE LEE OF THE ROCKIES WILL GIVE A 
SOUTHERLY FLOW OF WARMER AND MORE MOIST AIR BY MONDAY. THE GFS AND 
ECMWF DEPICT A WARM FRONT PUSHING NORTHWARD ON MONDAY NIGHT...THOUGH 
ENSEMBLES DIFFER ON TIMING. WILL CONTINUE A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY.

HOWEVER...ENOUGH LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE RETURN WITH DEWPOINTS IN THE 50S

THURSDAY AFTERNOON-EVENING.

FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...ANOTHER SHORT-WAVE MOVES ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN SECTIONS OF THE NATION (NORTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT

RIDGING INTO THE GULF...MOISTURE AND INSTABILITY VERY LIMITED AHEAD 
OF FRONT...SO ANY CONVECTION WILL LIKELY BE AFTER FROPA. WILL CARRY 
LOW CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT-EARLY SATURDAY MORNING.

FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST ACROSS THE 
NORTHEAST UNITED STATES WITH SURFACE RIDGING BUILD INTO THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS PRODUCING DRY AND COOLER WEATHER.

FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...SURFACE RIDGING MOVES EAST OF THE

BUILDS IS. A WEAK SHORT WAVE IS PROJECTED TO TRANSLATE THROUGH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION EARLY TUESDAY BUT A DECIDED LACK OF

EXPECTED TO REMAIN GENERALLY ABOVE CLIMO AS UPPER FLOW TRANSITIONS

SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV GUIDANCE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS ARE IN FAIR
AGREEMENT IN PUSHING NEXT FRONTAL BOUNDARY THROUGH OHIO VALLEY
REGION BY 00Z THURSDAY...AND LACK OF MOISTURE ON SOUTHERN END OF
SYSTEM SHOULD LIMIT ANY CHANCE OF SHRA/TSRA AT THIS TIME FOR THE AREA.

HIGH PRESSURE IS PROGGED BY MODELS TO BUILD INTO THE TENNESSEE
VALLEY REGION FOR THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. NEXT WEAK FRONTAL BOUNDARY
AGAIN SHOULD HAVE MOST OF THE MOISTURE TO THE NORTH OF THE AREA BY
00Z SATURDAY...AS IT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE THROUGH THE ENTIRE
FORECAST AREA BY 06Z SATURDAY. WILL CONTINUE WITH LOW PRECIP
CHANCES FORECAST AREA WIDE FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON AND OVERNIGHT
FRIDAY NIGHT/EARLY SATURDAY.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A NORTH-TO-SOUTH ORIENTED COLD FRONT 
EXTENDING FROM NEAR INDIANAPOLIS SOUTHWARD TO GENERALLY ALONG THE TN 
RIVER BETWEEN NASHVILLE AND JACKSON TN. AN UNSEASONABLY WARM AND 
HUMID AIR MASS REMAINS OVER THE FORECAST AREA...WITH WATER VAPOR 
SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALING THAT THE HIGH MOISTURE CONTENT EXTENDS 
IN A LONG PLUME FROM THE EASTERN PACIFIC OCEAN AND GULF OF MEXICO. 
MODELS INDICATE THAT THE UPPER-LEVEL WINDS (WHICH HAVE BEEN PARALLEL 
TO THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY...PREVENTING MUCH OF AN EASTWARD PUSH) WILL 
BECOME MORE SOUTHWESTERLY TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD HELP TO PUSH THIS 
FRONTAL BOUNDARY A LITTLE FASTER TO THE EAST OVERNIGHT INTO MONDAY. 
HOWEVER...MODELS INDICATE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE WILL HELP 
TO INTENSIFY CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT AHEAD OF THIS FRONT AS IT MOVES 
INTO THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. THUS...IT STILL APPEARS THAT 
RAINFALL COULD BECOME HEAVY AT TIMES...WITH A FLOODING THREAT 
CONTINUING OVERNIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST AND FLASH FLOOD WATCH APPEAR TO BE ON 
TRACK...BUT WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE ZONES THIS EVENING TO REMOVE THE 
MENTION OF THE SEVERE TSTORM WATCH.

SITES THIS EVENING AND FORECAST SOME MVFR REDUCTION IN VSBY AS SOME
HIGH RAINFALL RATES OCCUR WITH THE PASSAGE OF THE STORMS. CEILINGS
SHOULD MAINLY STAY MVFR. BELIEVE CONVECTION WILL WEAKEN TO SOME
STRATIFORM -SHRA BY LATE EVENING BEFORE ENDING SHORTLY AFTER
MIDNIGHT. USED SOME LOW MVFR CEILINGS AT CHA LATER TONIGHT CLOSER
TO THE HIGHER DEWPOINT AIR. ATMOSPHERE WILL BE A LITTLE MORE
CONDUCIVE TO CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ON SUNDAY ESPECIALLY LATER IN

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL PUSH 
CLOSER...BUT STILL SHOULD BE TO OUR WEST THROUGH SUNDAY.  AXIS OF 
THE HEAVIER RAIN SHOULD STAY TO OUR WEST AS WELL DURING THE PERIOD.  
WILL HAVE TO CARRY CHANCE POPS TONIGHT...THEN WILL INCREASE TO CAT 
POPS FAR WEST...LIKELY CENTRAL AND CHANCE FAR EAST/NORTHEAST ZONES 
SUNDAY AFTERNOON. SEVERE THREAT MAY BIT HIGHER SUNDAY AS WELL IF 
MODEST FORECAST INSTABILITY INCREASE IS REALIZED.  GFS MOS TEMPS 
GENERALLY LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.    


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...HEIGHT OF UPCOMING 
EVENT STILL APPEARS TO BE FOCUSED IN THE SUNDAY NIGHT TO MONDAY 
MORNING TIME FRAME BASED ON LATEST MODEL AND SREF RUNS. GREATEST
AMOUNTS OF RAINFALL EXPECTED ON PLATEAU WITH AMOUNTS DECREASING
SOMEWHAT EASTWARD. STILL APPEARS TO BE A POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT
RAIN EVENT FOR THE ENTIRE CWA HOWEVER...AND WILL ISSUE SPS TO COVER
POTENTIAL. SYSTEM MOVES OUT BY LATE MONDAY WITH DRY PERIOD
EXPECTED THROUGH MUCH OF THE WORK WEEK. STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY
ABOUT MID WEEK AS ECMWF DEPICTS SHORT WAVE TRANSLATING THROUGH THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION...BUT LEFT THOSE PERIODS DRY FOR NOW.
NEXT POTENTIALLY SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM APPROACHES BY LATE IN THE LONG
TERM BUT SIGNIFICANT TIMING ISSUES PRECLUDE ANY CONFIDENCE OF WHEN
THIS FEATURE WILL ACTUALLY AFFECT OUR REGION. THUS SPREAD SLIGHT
CHANCE POPS OVER SEVERAL PERIODS TO ACCOUNT FOR UNCERTAINTY. FOR
TEMPS...TENDED TO SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT MEX TEMPS FOR MID WEEK AS THEY
APPEAR TOO WARM GIVEN EXPECTED SCENARIO.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...UPPER RIDGE OVER THE AREA WILL 
SHIFT EAST DURING THE PERIOD AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES TO 
EXTEND IN FROM THE SOUTHEAST. WILL SEE A FEW CLOUDS AROUND AT 
TIMES...BUT SHOULD BE CLEAR TO MOSTLY CLEAR THROUGH THE PERIOD.  
WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.  


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES 
REMAIN IN REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH SLOW-MOVING...POTENTIALLY
SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION
THIS WEEKEND. APPEARS MAIN EVENT WILL OCCUR IN THE LATE SUNDAY TO
EARLY MONDAY TIME FRAME WITH MORE SCATTERED COVERAGE BRACKETING THE
PERIODS AROUND THIS TIME FRAME. MODEL SOLUTIONS BEGIN TO DIVERGE BY
THE MIDDLE OF NEXT WEEK AS GFS DEPICTS UPPER SHORT WAVE TROUGH
TRANSLATING THOUGH THE REGION ON TUESDAY WHILE THE ECMWF DEPICTS
GENERALLY DRY CONDITIONS. DID NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO
PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST DUE TO THIS UNCERTAINTY. WENT DRY FOR LATE
IN THE LONG TERM. DISCOUNTED THE 00Z GFS DEPICTION OF AN UPPER
TROUGH OVER THE EASTERN CONUS BY LATE IN THE LONG TERM AS IT HAS NO
SUPPORT FROM ANY OF THE GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS OR THE ECMWF. ALSO
WENT WELL ABOVE MEX GUIDANCE TEMPS FOR BOTH WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY
DUE TO THIS ANOMALOUS DEPICTION.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
345 AM EDT THU APR 29 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...FAIR WEATHER PATTERN TO CONTINUE 
TODAY AND TONIGHT AS UPPER RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS SLOWLY EAST TO THE 
APPALACHIANS. SOME CI SPILLING OVER THE TOP OF THE RIDGE BUT THE 
BALANCE OF THE DAY WILL BE SUNNY. THE INSOLATION IN COMBINATION WITH 
A SHIFT TO LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW WILL ALLOW HIGH TEMPERATURES TO 
BOUNCE BACK TO NORMAL FOR LATE APRIL. IT WON'T BE QUITE AS COOL 
TONIGHT AS MILDER AIR CONTINUES TO ADVECT INTO THE REGION ON LIGHT 
SOUTHERLY WINDS. MAINTAINED THE FROST ADVISORY STATEMENT FOR THE 
EXPECTED THREAT THIS MORNING.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BECOMES 
ANCHORED OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST ON FRIDAY...PROVIDING A GOOD LOW 
LEVEL SOUTHERLY FLOW OFF THE GULF. INCREASING MOISTURE ADVECTION 
WILL BRING A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS FOR 
SATURDAY....BEGINNING AN EXTENDED WET PERIOD FOR THE AREA. A 
SLOW-MOVING CLOSED LOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND THE POSITIONING 
OF THE JET STREAM ACROSS THE MID MS VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES WILL 
PROVIDE AN UNSETTLED PATTERN THROUGH MONDAY. CATEGORICAL TO LIKELY 
POPS SEEM WARRANTED DURING THIS TIME FRAME AS THE GFS AND ECMWF ARE 
IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE WET PATTERN...AND GFS ENSEMBLES SHOW GOOD 
AGREEMENT. MODELS HAVE SHOWN GOOD RUN-TO-RUN CONSISTENCY AS WELL. 
THE BEST PRECIP CHANCES LOOK TO BE ON SUNDAY WHEN A 850 MB FRONT 
APPROACHES THE AREA...AND THE UPPER JET MOVES INTO A MORE FAVORABLE 
POSITION OVER THE OHIO VALLEY/GREAT LAKES TO PROVIDE ENHANCED 
DIVERGENCE ALOFT. GIVEN THE POTENTIAL EXTENDED WET PERIOD AND THE 
PERSISTENT SOUTH-SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW...THE THREAT FOR FLOODING WILL 
NEED TO BE MONITORED AS THE WEEKEND APPROACHES. THOUGH THE FRONT 
MOVES THROUGH THE AREA MONDAY AND MOISTURE DECREASES...THE PASSAGE 
OF THE UPPER TROUGH SHOULD KEEP RAIN CHANCES GOING INTO TUESDAY. 
ANOTHER CLOSED LOW CROSSES THE GREAT LAKES ON WEDNESDAY...SO WILL 
KEEP CHANCE POPS GOING FOR DAY 7.

.DISCUSSION...UPPER TROF HAS MOVED SE OF AREA. SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE 
BUILDING IN FROM THE NW. DECREASING CLOUD COVER AND SLACKENING WINDS 
WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO FALL THROUGH EARLY DAWN. LOW LEVEL MOISTURE 
SUFFICIENT FOR PATCHY FROST AND FOG. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...AN UPPER LOW IS MAKING ITS WAY 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. ASSOCIATED SCATTERED SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS HAVE SPREAD OVER THE AREA.  WITH COLD AIR ALOFT AND A 
WEAKLY UNSTABLE AIR MASS...A FEW THUNDERSTORMS THAT DEVELOP ACROSS 
THE AREA COULD PRODUCE SMALL HAIL AND GUSTY WINDS.  CONVECTION 
SHOULD END BY SUNSET AS DRY AIR AND HIGH PRESSURE BUILD IN.  COLD 
AIR IS CONTINUING TO FILTER IN AND WILL KEEP TEMPERATURES BELOW 
NORMAL TONIGHT.  LOWS ARE EXPECTED TO DROP INTO THE 30S AT MANY 
LOCATIONS AND A FROST ADVISORY REMAINS IN EFFECT FOR THESE LOCATIONS 
DURING THE OVERNIGHT...EARLY MORNING HOURS.  TUESDAY WILL SEE A 
DRYING AND WARMING TREND AS HIGH PRESSURE ESTABLISHES ITSELF OVER 
THE REGION.

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...RIDGING BOTH SURFACE 
AND ALOFT WILL KEEP DRY AND WARMER CONDITIONS ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. DUE TO THE GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING 
CONDITIONS WEDNESDAY NIGHT...PATCHY FROST WILL ONCE AGAIN BE 
POSSIBLE ACROSS NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA EARLY 
THURSDAY MORNING.

FOR LATE FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...RIDGING WILL MOVE EAST ALLOWING FOR 
RETURN OF GULF MOISTURE INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS. A DEEP-BROAD UPPER TROUGH WILL ESTABLISH ITSELF ACROSS 
THE ROCKY'S AND PLAIN STATES FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY BEFORE

325 AM EDT TUE APR 27 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...THE CLOSED LOW OVER 
MISSOURI THIS MORNING WILL TRANSITION TO AN OPEN WAVE AS IT TRACKS 
SOUTHEAST THROUGH TODAY. THE MODELS SEEM TO HAVE A GOOD HANDLE ON 
THIS SYSTEM...SO WILL GO WITH LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS TODAY. THE 
AREA OF RAIN MOVING INTO MIDDLE TN APPEARS TO BE ASSOCIATED WITH 500 
MB PVA AND 850-700 MB CONVERGENCE...AND WILL REACH OUR AREA AROUND 
12Z. AFTER THIS INITIAL SURGE OF PRECIP THIS MORNING...UPSTREAM 
SATELLITE TRENDS INDICATE SOME CLEARING WILL OCCUR. THE MIDLEVEL 
COLD POOL ALSO MOVES OVER THIS AFTERNOON...ALLOWING FOR SOME 
DESTABILIZATION. NAM AND GFS INDICATE MLCAPE VALUES AROUND 300 
J/KG...LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES OF 7-8 C/KM...AND TT AROUND 55 C...SO 
WE COULD SEE SOME SCATTERED THUNDERSTORMS TODAY. SOME SMALL HAIL AND 
STRONG WIND GUSTS WILL BE POSSIBLE GIVEN THE STEEP LAPSE RATES AND 
INVERTED-V SOUNDINGS SHOWN BY THE MODELS.

THE PASSAGE OF THE 700 MB TROUGH SHOULD BRING AN END TO ANY SHOWERS 
THIS EVENING...AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW RAPID DRYING ALOFT AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. A SURFACE RIDGE AXIS QUICKLY BUILDS INTO THE AREA 
TONIGHT...WHICH SHOULD DROP WINDS OFF TO NEAR CALM IN MOST 
LOCATIONS. THIS WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO FALL VERY QUICKLY...INTO 
THE 30S ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA. LOWS IN THE MID 30S APPEAR LIKELY 
ACROSS THE NORTH AND IN THE MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU...SO A FROST 
ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED FOR TONIGHT. 

WEDNESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT WILL FEATURE A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
OVER THE AREA...WITH CLEAR SKIES AND A WARMING TREND EXPECTED. THERE 
COULD BE SOME PATCHY FROST IN SOME AREAS AGAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT...BUT 
BY THURSDAY HIGH TEMPS WILL BE BACK TO NORMAL...IN THE 70S. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS GENERALLY AGREE THAT 
LONG WAVE RIDGE PRESSES SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS TOWARD 
THE EASTERN SEABOARD ON FRIDAY WITH STRENGTHENING SOUTHWEST FLOW 
ALOFT AS LONG WAVE TROF/UPPER LOW ALSO SHIFTS ONLY SLOWLY EAST 
ACROSS THE NORTH CENTRAL STATES. SEVERAL SHORTER WAVELENGTH FEATURES 
WILL TRAVERSE THE MID MISSISSIPPI AND OHIO VALLEY. THE SOUTHERN 
EXTENT OF THESE FEATURES MAY CLIP THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
AND WITH STRENGTHENING LOW LEVEL FLOW SQUEEZED BETWEEN LOWER 
PRESSURE ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND A SURFACE RIDGE PARKED 
OVER THE WESTERN ATLANTIC...THE POSSIBILITY OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS WILL INCREASE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE 
WEEKEND RIGHT THROUGH MONDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL SLOWLY TRACK EASTWARD ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TODAY AND TONIGHT. MOISTURE WRAPPING AROUND 
THE LOW WILL KEEP CLOUDS IN PLACE THROUGH THE SHORT TERM...WITH 
SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS RAIN SHOWERS. BEST PRECIP CHANCES WILL BE IN 
THE NORTH CLOSER TO THE SYSTEM...AND WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS THERE 
DROPPING DOWN TO CHANCES SOUTH. HOWEVER...PRECIP AMOUNTS WILL BE 
LIGHT AS LIFT REMAINS QUITE WEAK. SHOWERS WILL BE MAINTAINED BY SOME 
INSTABILITY UNDER COOLING MIDLEVEL TEMPS AND CONVERGENCE WITH A WEAK 
850 MB TROUGH. WINDS WILL BE GUSTY AGAIN TODAY...BUT A BIT LIGHTER 
AS THE MIXED LAYER WILL NOT BE AS DEEP DUE TO CLOUD COVER. CLOUDS 
AND WEAK COLD ADVECTION SHOULD KEEP TEMPS FROM RISING MUCH 
TODAY...AS HIGHS WILL ONLY REACH THE LOWER 60S NORTH TO MID 60S 
SOUTH AND 50S IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 

AS THE LOW MOVES AWAY TONIGHT...A MIDLEVEL RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE 
AREA. FORECAST SOUNDINGS SHOW A DRYING TREND THROUGH THE NIGHT...SO 
WILL BRING POPS DOWN TO A SLIGHT CHANCE/LOW CHANCE AFTER MIDNIGHT. 
ANOTHER MID/UPPER LEVEL TROUGH AND JET STREAK WILL APPROACH FROM THE 
WEST LATE TONIGHT...BUT MOST PRECIP WITH THIS FEATURE SHOULD HOLD 
OFF UNTIL AFTER 12Z TUESDAY.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE 
AREA ON TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL KEEP HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY 
WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. A FRONT TRACKS INTO THE AREA BY 
LATE FRIDAY AND LINGERS INTO SUNDAY. WILL KEEP ONLY LOW CHANCE POPS 
GOING FOR NOW. SHOULD SEE A WARMING TREND THROUGH THE PERIOD. STAYED 
NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL BE TRACKING ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY AND
THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. RAIN SHOWERS AND
BROKEN TO OVERCAST CLOUDS WILL CONTINUE TO SPREAD ACROSS THE TN
VALLEY REGION. UPSTREAM OBSERVATIONS OVER MIDDLE TN AND KY INDICATE
MVFR CEILINGS ARE ADVANCING THIS WAY...AND SHOULD REACH TRI AROUND
09Z AND TYS AROUND 10Z. TRI WILL LIKELY SEE MVFR CIGS REMAINING
THROUGH THE DAY...BUT TYS WILL BE IN AND OUT OF MVFR CONDITIONS ALL
DAY. WILL STICK WITH VFR CIGS AT TYS BUT FLUCTUATIONS ARE LIKELY.
FARTHER SOUTH...CHA SHOULD KEEP VFR CIGS AS A WEST WIND OFF THE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LARGE RAIN SHIELD ASSOCIATED WITH 
FRONTAL SYSTEM APPROACHING FROM THE WEST. SFC WIND FIELD IS A BIT 
DISORGANIZED. THE GULF IS STILL OPEN ALOFT AND SO MUCH OF THE 
CURRENT "FUEL" MOISTURE IS ABOVE THE SURFACE. DEWPOINTS HAVE 
INCREASED INTO THE 60S, THOUGH, SINCE YESTERDAY, AND TEMPS ARE DOWN, 
SO THAT RH'S ARE QUITE HIGH. WITH RELATIVELY STABLE AIRMASS OVER 
EAST SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS ATTM, CURRENT PRECIP IS STRATIFORM AND 
W/O THUNDER. 

THERE SHOULD BE A BREAK IN THE CONVECTIVE ACTION AFTER SUNRISE WITH 
THE LOCAL AIR MASS LIKELY DESTABILIZING FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF 
CONVECTION IN THE AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODELS AGREE ON AN 
ORGANIZED WIND FIELD DEVELOPING BY THE AFTERNOON INTO THE EVENING, 
WITH MODERATE TO STRONG HELICITY VALUES. THIS WILL CREATE A 
POTENTIAL FOR LONG LIVED UPDRAFTS. MODERATE CAPE AND LI'S WILL ALSO 
ALLOW FOR STRONG UVV IN STORMS. IT WILL BE CRITICAL TO WATCH FOR SFC 
BOUNDARIES FROM OLD STORMS AS THIS WILL INCREASE HELICITY VALUES 
EVEN FURTHER ON A LOCAL BASIS. DUE TO THE PROLONGED NATURE OF THE 
FORECAST UPDRAFTS, EXPECT THAT VERY LARGE HAIL WILL BE LIKELY, THAT 
IS GOLF BALL OR LARGER. ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS MAY ALSO PRODUCE 
TORNADOES AND HAIL UP TO BASEBALL SIZE, ESPECIALLY ALONG THE 
CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND IN THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA, WHERE 
TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER, PW'S HIGHER AND CONVECTIVE TEMPS ONLY 
IN THE UPPER 70S. TIMING WILL BE CRITICAL SO THAT ANY BREAKS IN THE 
CLOUDS AND PRECIP (AND THE RAIN SHIELD IS ALREADY BECOMING BLOTCHY 
AT THIS WRITING) WILL PERMIT RAPID WARMING ON A LOCAL BASIS. SOME 
FLOODING RAINS MAY OCCUR, BUT STEERING WINDS APPEAR FAIRLY STRONG 
AND SO MOST STORMS WILL MOVE QUICKLY. HOWEVER, ANY STORMS DEVELOPING 
ALONG QUASI-STATIONARY BOUNDARIES WILL BE SLOW MOVING AND MAY 
PRODUCE FLASH FLOODING OR URBAN/SMALL STREAM FLOODING IN SMALL 
AREAS. 

EXPECT CONVECTION TO CONTINUE PAST SUNSET AND SLOWLY DIE DOWN 
THROUGH THE NIGHT. HAVE KEPT POPS IN THE CHANCE CATEGORY UNTIL 
SUNRISE SUNDAY. LARGELY LEFT TEMPS, WINDS, ETC ALONE.


.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER LOW TRACKS THROUGH THE 
AREA ON SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...WILL GO FOR CHANCE POPS WITH THE 
HIGHEST CHANCES OUR THE NORTHERN ZONES WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE IS 
INDICATED. HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A WEST-TO-EAST ORIENTED QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY OVER CENTRAL KY AND SOUTHWEST VA...WITH RADARS REVEALING 
SOME SCATTERED SHOWERS OCCURRING ALONG AND AHEAD OF IT. THE LOCAL 
AIR MASS IS PROGGED TO REMAIN FAIRLY DRY IN THE LOWER LEVELS THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING...BUT SOME ISOLATED CONVECTION STILL MAY BE 
POSSIBLE INTO THE EVENING HOURS. A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
THE CENTRAL PLAINS IS PROGGED TO TRIGGER A LARGE AREA OF CONVECTION 
OVER THE MS RIVER VALLEY LATER BY THIS EVENING...WHICH THE GFS MODEL 
INDICATES WILL MOVE EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY TONIGHT. THIS 
CONVECTIVE COMPLEX SHOULD WEAKEN AS IT MOVES INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
AFTER MIDNIGHT...BUT THINK THAT A FEW ISOLATED SEVERE STORMS WITH 
DAMAGING WINDS AND LARGE HAIL WILL BE POSSIBLE DURING THE OVERNIGHT 
AND EARLY MORNING HOURS ON SATURDAY. THERE SHOULD BE A BREAK IN THE 
CONVECTIVE ACTION AFTER SUNRISE ON SATURDAY...WITH THE LOCAL AIR 
MASS LIKELY DESTABILIZING FOR ANOTHER ROUND OF CONVECTION IN THE 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A STRONG WIND FIELD 
DEVELOPING OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY BY LATE SATURDAY AFTERNOON... 
AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT. VERY STRONG HELICITY VALUES 
(ESPECIALLY IN THE LOWER LEVELS OVER THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY 
SUNSET) COMBINED WITH STRONG UPPER-LEVEL DYNAMICS WILL LIKELY 
PRODUCE SUPERCELLS ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WITH THE POTENTIAL 
FOR EXTREMELY LARGE HAIL (AROUND GOLFBALL SIZE HAIL) AND SOME 
ISOLATED TORNADOES (A FEW POSSIBLY STRONG AND LONG LIVED). SOME 
COMPLICATING FACTORS WHICH COULD AFFECT THE SEVERITY OF THE EVENT 
INCLUDE THE FACT THAT THE MODELS STILL INDICATE THAT THE BEST 
INSTABILITY WILL NOT DEVELOP OVER THE FORECAST AREA UNTIL THE 
EVENING HOURS (WITH ONLY A WEAKLY UNSTABLE ENVIRONMENT ON SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON). HOWEVER...THINK THAT THE CONVECTIVE PARAMETERIZATION 
SCHEMES OF THE MODELS MAY BE PRODUCING UNREALISTIC THERMAL PROFILES 
ON THE SOUNDINGS FOR SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND EVENING DUE TO THE 
EARLIER CONVECTION DURING THE MORNING HOURS. ANOTHER 'FLY IN THE 
OINTMENT' INVOLVES THE POSSIBILITY THAT A CONVECTIVE COMPLEX COULD 
INTENSIFY FURTHER SOUTH AND CUT OFF THE BEST MOISTURE SUPPLY TO THE 
FORECAST AREA. DESPITE THESE POSSIBLE CONVECTIVE TIMING ISSUES... 
SEVERE WX PARAMETERS INDICATE THAT THE POTENTIAL WILL EXIST FOR AN 
OUTBREAK OF SEVERE WEATHER ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY...WHICH WILL 
EXTEND INTO THE FORECAST AREA (ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE WESTERN HALF). 
SCATTERED CONVECTION SHOULD AGAIN DEVELOP ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON AND 
EVENING...AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH SWINGS ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AN UPPER LOW WILL TRACK THROUGH 
TO OUR NORTH EARLY IN THE PERIOD. THIS WILL ROTATE THROUGH A SERIES 
OF IMPULSES WHICH WILL BRING OCCASIONAL RAIN SHOWERS TO THE AREA 
MONDAY AND TUESDAY. WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS AND HAVE A RETURN TO DRY 
WEATHER WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. MODELS IN POOR AGREEMENT REGARDING 
THE NEXT SYSTEM PROGGED INTO THE REGION AROUND THE FRIDAY TIME 
FRAME. CONFIDENCE LOW...BUT FOR NOW...WILL LEAVE THINGS DRY ON

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN ELONGATED AND WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE EXTENDING 
ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD...WITH HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE 
GULF COAST. A WEAK COLD FRONT OVER THE MID WEST IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
SOUTH INTO THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY BY SUNRISE ON THURSDAY MORNING... 
BUT THEN BECOME QUASI-STATIONARY NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA AS THE 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL. A WARM FRONT IS ALSO PROGGED TO 
DEVELOP ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...AS SOUTHERLY 
WINDS STRENGTHEN AHEAD OF A DEEPENING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
CENTRAL PLAINS. WITH THE FORECAST AREA CAUGHT IN THE MIDDLE OF THESE 
TWO FRONTAL BOUNDARIES...WILL PLAN TO MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS ON THURSDAY AFTERNOON. THE WARM FRONT OVER THE DEEP SOUTH IS 
EXPECTED TO MOVE NORTH ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY...SO WILL 
MENTION HIGHER CHANCE POPS AND SOME THUNDER SINCE THE MODEL 
SOUNDINGS REVEAL SOME MARGINAL INSTABILITY. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND 
NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT 
AND LOOK REASONABLE. WILL PLAN TO COMPROMISE BETWEEN THE TWO FOR 
FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. 

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS SIMILAR SATURDAY 
BUT BEGIN TO DIVERGE BY SUNDAY. STAYED A LITTLE CLOSER TO ECMWF 
DEPICTION THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD. AMPLIFIED UPPER PATTERN 
DEVELOPS BY SATURDAY WITH UPPER TROF APPROACHING THROUGH THE PLAINS. 
NICE INFLUX OF MOISTURE FROM THE GULF OF MEXICO AND HEALTHY UPPER 
LEVEL JET WILL LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS 
SATURDAY AND SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE BEST CHANCE FOR PRECIP SATURDAY 
NIGHT IN ADVANCE OF SYSTEM COOL FRONT. MEDIUM TO HIGHER CHANCE POP 
LEFT IN PLACE FOR SUNDAY AS FRONT MAKES ITS WAY ACROSS THE 
APPALACHIANS. UPPER LEVEL TROFINESS WILL HANG AROUND THE GREAT LAKES 
THROUGH TUESDAY WITH SEVERAL PIECES OF ENERGY ROTATING SOUTHEAST 
THROUGH THE TROUGH CIRCULATION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. 
THEREFORE HELD ONTO LOW CHANCE POPS THROUGH TUESDAY FOR POSSIBLE 
SHOWERS. THE FORECAST AREA FINALLY WAVES GOODBYE TO THE LONG WAVE 
TROUGH AS IT EXITS ACROSS THE EASTERN SEABOARD TUESDAY NIGHT INTO 
WEDNESDAY. BUILDING HEIGHTS WILL ALLOW FOR THE POSSIBILITY OF A DRY 
WEDNESDAY. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO SUGGESTED MEX MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS 
ALTHOUGH EDGED THE NUMBERS SLIGHTLY HIGHER MONDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES
TRENDING A LITTLE WETTER FOR THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. KEPT
THURSDAY DRY FOR NOW AS SURFACE RIDGE REMAINS IN PLACE AND UPPER

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...AN INVERTED TROUGH 
TRACKING THROUGH TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  LIGHT RAIN SHOULD BE MOVING 
UP FROM THE SOUTH TONIGHT...BUT THE BULK OF THE PRECIPITATION SHOULD 
HOLD OFF UNTIL LATE AND INTO TUESDAY.  WILL KEEP HIGHEST CHANCE IN 
THE SOUTH TONIGHT.  WILL BUMP UP POPS AND GO WITH LIKELY CHANCES FOR 
TUESDAY.  THE TROUGH EXITS THE AREA ON TUESDAY NIGHT...WILL KEEP THE 
HIGHEST CHANCES FOR THE EVENING HOURS.  GUIDANCE NUMBER FOR 
TEMPERATURES SIMILAR SO DIDN'T STRAY TOO FAR. 

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...UNCERTAINTY HIGHER THAN 
AVERAGE FOR THE LONG TERM.  EARLY IN PERIOD BROAD TROUGH OVER 
EASTERN US WITH POSSIBILITY OF SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY MOVING 
THROUGH IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW.  HOWEVER...GIVEN POOR AGREEMENT ON 
ANY FEATURE AND EXPECTED WEAKNESS OF ANY WAVES FOR NOW WILL GO 
CLOSER TO BOTH SREF AND PERSISTENCE AND KEEP WED AND THU DRY OTHER 
THAN A FEW LINGERING SHOWERS NORTHEAST EARLY WED.  FURTHER 
OUT...SIGNIFICANT  MODEL DIFFERENCES FOR MORE SIGNIFICANT WEEKEND 
SYSTEM. FAIRLY HIGH CONFIDENCE OF SOME SIGNIFICANT PRECIP DURING THE 
WEEKEND...BUT TIMING UNCERTAINTIES WILL LEAD TO LONGER PERIOD OF 
MAINLY CHANCE POPS RATHER THAN HIGHER POPS FOR FEWER PERIODS.  WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY AS MODELS HINT A WEAKER WAVE MAY 
AFFECT THE AREA DURING THAT TIME FRAME.  WILL GENERALLY NOW STRAY 
FAR FROM GFS MOS TEMPS.

TO A FEW SHOWERS LATE TONIGHT...BUT FOLLOWED A BLEND OF MOS 
POPS...WHICH WAS IN LINE WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND ADJACENT OFFICES 
GRIDS.

OTHERWISE...FROST ADVISORY WILL RUN THROUGH 9AM EDT TODAY...WITH 
CURRENT TEMPS IN THE 30S WHERE LIGHTEST WINDS WERE NOTED. MAX TEMPS 
SHOULD REACH JUST BELOW SEASONAL NORMS THIS AFTERNOON...THEN MILDER 
MINS TONIGHT AS CLOUDS INCREASE.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE TN
VALLEY AND LOW PRESSURE OVER THE FL PANHANDLE TUESDAY MORNING WILL
CAUSE SCATTERED SHOWERS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS SYSTEM WILL
MOVE SLOWLY EAST AND INTO THE CAROLINAS BY WEDNESDAY MORNING. HAVE

433 AM EDT SUN APR 18 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LIGHT NORTHERLY WINDS OVERNIGHT 
HAVE BEEN KEEPING TEMPS UP FROM GRID VALUES...IN MOST AREAS. SUCH 
THAT AREAS OF FROST LOOK TO BE LIMITED THIS MORNING...SO A FEW AREAS 
WERE TRIMMED OUT OF THE ONGOING FROST ADVISORY. MOS HAS DONE A POOR 
JOB OF HANDLING HOW LOW CURRENT DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE FALLEN...SO MIN 
RH THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD CERTAINLY BE QUITE LOW. HOWEVER...WIND 
SPEEDS WILL BE WELL BELOW RED FLAG WARNING LEVELS.

OTHERWISE...CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT WILL GRADUALLY GIVE WAY TO RISING 
HEIGHTS...WHILE SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS SOUTHWARD INTO THE TN VALLEY 
AND SRN APPALACHIANS. EXPECT MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND A FEW AREAS WITH 
MINS IN THE 30S AGAIN TONIGHT. 

DUE TO LAST MINUTE UNCERTAINTY AND TO AVOID CONFUSION WITH THIS 
MORNING'S FROST ADVISORY...I OPTED NOT TO ISSUE A FROST ADVISORY FOR 
SUNDAY NIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...PATTERN IS CHANGING
SOMEWHAT THIS WEEK. INITIALLY MONDAY HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER
THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY. MONDAY NIGHT
LOW PRESSURE AREA ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL TRACK EAST WITH
MOISTURE MOVING OVER THE FRONT. THIS BRINGS CLOUDS AND SLIGHT
CHANCE SHOWERS TO MOSTLY SOUTHERN SECTIONS MONDAY NIGHT AND
SPREADING NORTH TUESDAY AND THEN EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY
NIGHT. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN VALLEY
AND PLATEAU. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK IN WEDNESDAY. RIDGING
ALOFT EXPECTED TO KEEP FORECAST AREA DRY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH
WARMING TEMPERATURES. FRIDAY FRONTAL SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE
PLAINS AND INCREASING MOISTURE SPREADS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.

433 AM EDT SUN APR 18 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...LIGHT NORTHERLY WINDS OVERNIGHT 
HAVE BEEN KEEPING TEMPS UP FROM GRID VALUES...IN MOST AREAS. SUCH 
THAT AREAS OF FROST LOOK TO BE LIMITED THIS MORNING...SO A FEW AREAS 
WERE TRIMMED OUT OF THE ONGOING FROST ADVISORY. MOS HAS DONE A POOR 
JOB OF HANDLING HOW LOW CURRENT DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE FALLEN...SO MIN 
RH THIS AFTERNOON SHOULD CERTAINLY BE QUITE LOW. HOWEVER...WIND 
SPEEDS WILL BE WELL BELOW RED FLAG WARNING LEVELS.

OTHERWISE...CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT WILL GRADUALLY GIVE WAY TO RISING 
HEIGHTS...WHILE SURFACE RIDGE BUILDS SOUTHWARD INTO THE TN VALLEY 
AND SRN APPALACHIANS. EXPECT MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND A FEW AREAS WITH 
MINS IN THE 30S AGAIN TONIGHT. HAVE POSTED ANOTHER FROST ADVISORY... 
BUT FOR A SLIGHTLY SMALLER AREA THAN TODAY'S.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...PATTERN IS CHANGING
SOMEWHAT THIS WEEK. INITIALLY MONDAY HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER
THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY. MONDAY NIGHT
LOW PRESSURE AREA ALONG THE GULF COAST WILL TRACK EAST WITH
MOISTURE MOVING OVER THE FRONT. THIS BRINGS CLOUDS AND SLIGHT
CHANCE SHOWERS TO MOSTLY SOUTHERN SECTIONS MONDAY NIGHT AND
SPREADING NORTH TUESDAY AND THEN EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY
NIGHT. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS EASTERN MOUNTAINS AND SOUTHERN VALLEY
AND PLATEAU. WEAK HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK IN WEDNESDAY. RIDGING
ALOFT EXPECTED TO KEEP FORECAST AREA DRY THROUGH FRIDAY WITH
WARMING TEMPERATURES. FRIDAY FRONTAL SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER THE
PLAINS AND INCREASING MOISTURE SPREADS INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY.
THIS SHOULD BE A MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM WITH A CHANCE OF
THUNDERSTORMS SATURDAY AND PRODUCE MORE SIGNIFICANT RAINFALL THAN
TUESDAYS. THE SYSTEM WILL BE A SLOWER MOVER AND BE STILL WEST OF
THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY EVENING.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CLOUDS FROM REMNANTS OF 
THURSDAY'S CONVECTION HAVE DISSIPATED LEAVING MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. 
MODELS QUITE CONSISTENT WITH PREVIOUS RUNS IN SHOWING THE UPPER 
RIDGE TO BREAK DOWN THIS AFTERNOON...AND ALLOW THE WEAK COLD FRONT 
TO SAG SE INTO AND THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT.

INSTABILITY IS NOT VERY IMPRESSIVE NOR IS THERE MUCH IN THE WAY OF 
UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT FOR CONVECTION. PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED 
ON TRACK...ALTHO I DID SLIGHTLY INCREASE POPS ACROSS OUR NRN PLATEAU 
AND SW VA COUNTIES WITH AN AREAL QUALIFIER (SCATTERED SHOWERS WITH 
ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS).

MOS GUIDANCE WAS TOO LOW ON MAX TEMPS FOR THURSDAY...SO TRENDED 
TOWARD OR JUST ABOVE THE WARMER MAXES...ESPECIALLY ACROSS CENTRAL 
AND SRN AREAS. MINIMUM RH INCREASES THIS AFTERNOON ABOVE ANY 
CRITICAL VALUES FOR FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS...ALTHO WINDS WILL BE 
BREEZY OVER SW VA AND NE TN. WILL LET DAY SHIFT CHECK WITH FIRE 
WEATHER DISTRICTS ON THE NEED FOR A FIRE DANGER STATEMENT.

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...FORECAST MODELS HAVE WEAK 
COLD FRONT PASSING THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY MORNING. WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE SHOWERS UNTIL ABOUT 18Z. HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN 
FROM THE NW LATE SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY. NW FLOW AND UPPER TROUGH 
ACROSS THE EASTERN STATES WILL ALLOW COOLER TEMPERATURES TO AFFECT 
THE REGION. HIGHS SATURDAY WILL BE MUCH COOLER SW VA AND NE TN SOME 
15 TO 20 DEGREES AND AROUND 10 DEGREES AT CHA. WINDS WILL BE FAIRLY 
STRONG WITH COLD AIR ADVECTION. SATURDAY NIGHT LOWS WILL DIP INTO 
THE MID 30S TO THE LOWER 40S. SUNDAYS HIGHS WILL LIKELY STAY IN THE 
50S HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND 60S ELSEWHERE. SUNDAY NIGHT ANOTHER COLD 
NIGHT WITH WINDS BECOMING LIGHT. FROST POSSIBLE WITH LOWS AGAIN IN 
THE 30S. HIGH PRESSURE WITH NORTHWEST FLOW CONTINUES TUESDAY THROUGH 
THURSDAY WITH A GRADUAL WARMING TREND AND LITTLE CHANCE FOR RAIN.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE CAROLINAS...EXTENDING WESTWARD ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. 
HIGHER DEWPOINTS THIS AFTERNOON (COMPARED TO YESTERDAY) LED TO THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF SOME SCATTERED CONVECTION ALONG THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS...BUT CURRENT RADARS REVEAL THIS EARLIER CONVECTION 
QUICKLY DISSIPATING WITH THE SETTING OF THE SUN. WITH HIGHER 
DEWPOINTS THIS EVENING AND SOME AREAS RECEIVING RAINFALL EARLIER 
THIS AFTERNOON...THINK THAT MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS 
TONIGHT WILL LEAD TO SOME PATCHY FOG DEVELOPING AFTER MIDNIGHT. 

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO REMOVE 
THE MENTION OF EVENING PRECIP...TO ADD A MENTION OF PATCHY FOG AFTER 
MIDNIGHT...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST

WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA-NORTHEAST
TENNESSEE...FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS...AND SOUTHWEST NORTH

FOR FRIDAY...RIDGING WILL ONCE AGAIN KEEP THINGS MOSTLY DRY AND UNSEASONABLY
WARM. MODELS SHOW DRIER LOW LEVEL CONDITIONS WITH DEWPOINTS SOME 3
TO 5 DEGREES LOWER. AIRMASS WILL NOT BE AS UNSTABLE IN THE
AFTERNOON AND PLAN ON KEEPING THINGS DRY. 

WINDS WILL INCREASE BY AFTERNOON AS PRESSURE GRADIENTS TIGHTEN
AHEAD OF AN APPROACHING COLD FRONT FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. THE HIGHER
WINDS AND LOWER HUMIDITY LEVELS WILL INCREASE THE FIRE DANGER. 

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WEAK COLD FRONT TRACKS

CONTINUED CHANCE POPS FOR MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY NIGHT AND 
SATURDAY AS PREVIOUSLY CONFIGURED. DRY REGIME RETURNS AS SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE AND NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT BECOME ESTABLISHED. NORTHWEST 
FLOW ALOFT WILL KEEP TEMPS NEAR CLIMO INSTEAD OF THE

EXPECT MUCH MORE THAN A FEW HIGH CLOUDS.  MAV DEW POINTS HAVE BEEN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
THE DOMINANT WEATHER FEATURE FOR THE AREA DURING THE SHORT TERM.  A 
WEAK BACKDOOR COLD FRONT WILL SAG SOUTH TOWARD THE AREA 
TONIGHT...BUT SHOULD JUST BRING A FEW HIGH CLOUDS.  EXPECT A CLEAR 
TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKY THROUGH THE PERIOD.  RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES 
WILL BE QUITE LOW AGAIN THIS AFTERNOON...DIPPING BELOW 25 PERCENT 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA...ALTHOUGH WINDS WILL BE LIGHT.    

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE 
AMPLIFIES WHILE SHIFTING FROM THE CENTER OF THE NATION EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD INTO THE EASTERN U.S. FROM TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY. BEFORE 
THE RIDGE ESTABLISHES ITSELF IN THE EAST A BACKDOOR COOL FRONT WILL 
LIMP SOUTH ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS TOWARD THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS REGION. THE FRONT WILL NOT HAVE MUCH INFLUENCE ON 
WEATHER ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OTHER THAN A SLIGHT INCREASE IN 
CLOUD COVER MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST 
TENNESSEE. LATE IN THE WEEK AROUND FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY THE 
RIDGE WILL BE IN THE PROCESS OF BREAKING DOWN AS AN UPPER LEVEL TROF 
DROPS SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE GREAT LAKES INTO THE NORTHEASTERN U.S. 
DRIVING A WEAK COOL FRONTAL BOUNDARY INTO THE FORECAST AREA. ATTM 
KEPT POPS BELOW 15 PERCENT FOR NOW AS THE FRONT DOESN'T LOOK LIKE IT 
WILL HAVE SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL INFLOW OFF THE GULF OF MEXICO TO 
PRODUCE RAIN. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MEX MOS INDICATED WARMING TREND 
THROUGH THE LONG TERM.

NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
912 PM EDT FRI APR 9 2010

.DISCUSSION...HIGH PRESSURE BRINGING A DRY AND COLD NIGHT TONIGHT. 
TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK.  WILL LEAVE 
CURRENT WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES AS IS.  WILL UPDATE FORECAST TO 
REMOVE EVENING WORDING...NO OTHER CHANGES PLANNED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND SATURDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW. THE SCATTERED CU OVER NORTHERN SECTIONS WILL DISSIPATE AT 
SUNSET...LEAVING CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS TONIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW 
TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE 30S ACROSS THE AREA...WITH THE 
MOUNTAINS...SW VA...AND NE TN LIKELY FALLING BELOW FREEZING BASED ON 
MOS GUIDANCE AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN TEMPERATURES. DID GO A COUPLE 
DEGREES BELOW GFS MOS FOR LOWS TONIGHT. A FREEZE WARNING WILL BE 
ISSUED FOR THIS AREA PLUS SW NC...WITH A FROST ADVISORY ACROSS THE 
PLATEAU COUNTIES AND CENTRAL TN VALLEY. AFTER A CHILLY 
START...SATURDAY WILL BRING PLENTY OF SUN AND HIGH TEMPERATURES IN 
THE UPPER 60S TO MID 70S. ALTHOUGH WINDS WILL BE LIGHT...RELATIVE 
HUMIDITIES WILL BE QUITE LOW...AROUND 25 PERCENT TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON...SO HAZARDOUS FIRE CONDITIONS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE A 
CONCERN.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THIS PERIOD STARTS WITH A ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND WEAK SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL...CENTERED JUST TO OUR EAST. ON SUNDAY A
WEAK RETURN FLOW BEGINS TO TAKE SHAPE...BUT WITH NO MOISTURE. BY
SUNDAY NIGHT SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING SOUTHWARD INTO THE
GREAT LAKES INDUCES A WEAK AND DRY FRONTAL PASSAGE LATE SUNDAY
NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING...THAT CUTS OFF THE RETURN FLOW AND SETS
UP A NORTHERLY FETCH THAT LASTS INTO MIDWEEK. HOWEVER...IN THE
UPPER LEVELS HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING THAT SHOULD HEAT THINGS UP
FROM SUBSIDENCE ALOFT.

TOUGHER FORECAST FOR TEMPS LATER IN THE WEEK...AS BACKDOOR COOL 
SURGES WORK THEIR WAY SOUTHWARD ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS...DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS AIR WILL BE ABLE 
TO BLEED INTO OUR CWA...FROM THE NORTHEAST DIRECTLY OR SOUTHEAST 
COMING AROUND THE BASE OF THE APPS. TENDING TOWARD THE WARMER SIDE 
OF MAX TEMP GUIDANCE FOR THESE PERIODS...AS I FEEL THAT UPPER RIDGE 
WILL DOMINATE OVER BACKDOOR COOL AIR INFLUENCE.

BY NEXT FRIDAY...UPPER RIDGE IS WEAKENING SOMEWHAT AND LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE LOOKS LIKE IT MAY FINALLY BE RETURNING AS SOUTHWEST WINDS 
BRING MOISTURE FROM THE WESTERN GULF.  NOT GOING TO INTRODUCE ANY 
POPS YET...BECAUSE STABLE AIR FROM BACKDOOR SYSTEMS STILL LOOKS VERY 
CLOSE BY...TO OUR SOUTH...SO MOISTURE COULD BE BLOCKED.  THIS WILL 
BE SOMETHING TO WATCH FOR LATER PERIODS.  ALSO, NO OBVIOUS FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTION CAN BE SEEN IN THE AREA EITHER.

NOT OFTEN WE SEE AN ENTIRE SEVEN DAY PERIOD WITH NO MENTION OF 
PRECIPITATION...WHICH STARTS TO MAKE FOR FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS.  
RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES GET PRETTY DRY ON SOME OF THE DAYS...BUT 
WINDS BEHAVE THEMSELVES FOR THE MOST PART THROUGH THIS PERIOD.  RH 
VALUES WILL LIKELY GO BELOW 35% AT MANY LOCATIONS ON A DAILY BASIS.

HIGH PRESSURE WILL SETTLE OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW. THE SCATTERED CU OVER NORTHERN SECTIONS WILL DISSIPATE AT 
SUNSET...LEAVING CLEAR SKIES AND CALM WINDS TONIGHT. THIS WILL ALLOW 
TEMPERATURES TO DROP INTO THE 30S ACROSS THE AREA...WITH THE 
MOUNTAINS...SW VA...AND NE TN LIKELY FALLING BELOW FREEZING BASED ON 
MOS GUIDANCE AND GFS ENSEMBLE MEAN TEMPERATURES. DID GO A COUPLE 
DEGREES BELOW GFS MOS FOR LOWS TONIGHT. A FREEZE WARNING WILL BE 
ISSUED FOR THIS AREA PLUS SW NC...WITH A FROST ADVISORY ACROSS THE 
PLATEAU COUNTIES AND CENTRAL TN VALLEY. AFTER A CHILLY 
START...SATURDAY WILL BRING PLENTY OF SUN AND HIGH TEMPERATURES IN 
THE UPPER 60S TO MID 70S. ALTHOUGH WINDS WILL BE LIGHT...RELATIVE 
HUMIDITIES WILL BE QUITE LOW...AROUND 25 PERCENT TOMORROW 
AFTERNOON...SO HAZARDOUS FIRE CONDITIONS WILL ONCE AGAIN BE A 
CONCERN.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...
THIS PERIOD STARTS WITH A ZONAL FLOW ALOFT AND WEAK SURFACE HIGH
PRESSURE STILL IN CONTROL...CENTERED JUST TO OUR EAST. ON SUNDAY A
WEAK RETURN FLOW BEGINS TO TAKE SHAPE...BUT WITH NO MOISTURE. BY
SUNDAY NIGHT SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING SOUTHWARD INTO THE
GREAT LAKES INDUCES A WEAK AND DRY FRONTAL PASSAGE LATE SUNDAY
NIGHT INTO MONDAY MORNING...THAT CUTS OFF THE RETURN FLOW AND SETS
UP A NORTHERLY FETCH THAT LASTS INTO MIDWEEK. HOWEVER...IN THE
UPPER LEVELS HIGH PRESSURE IS BUILDING THAT SHOULD HEAT THINGS UP
FROM SUBSIDENCE ALOFT.

TOUGHER FORECAST FOR TEMPS LATER IN THE WEEK...AS BACKDOOR COOL 
SURGES WORK THEIR WAY SOUTHWARD ON THE EAST SIDE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS...DIFFICULT TO KNOW HOW MUCH OF THIS AIR WILL BE ABLE 
TO BLEED INTO OUR CWA...FROM THE NORTHEAST DIRECTLY OR SOUTHEAST 
COMING AROUND THE BASE OF THE APPS. TENDING TOWARD THE WARMER SIDE 
OF MAX TEMP GUIDANCE FOR THESE PERIODS...AS I FEEL THAT UPPER RIDGE 
WILL DOMINATE OVER BACKDOOR COOL AIR INFLUENCE.

BY NEXT FRIDAY...UPPER RIDGE IS WEAKENING SOMEWHAT AND LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE LOOKS LIKE IT MAY FINALLY BE RETURNING AS SOUTHWEST WINDS 
BRING MOISTURE FROM THE WESTERN GULF.  NOT GOING TO INTRODUCE ANY 
POPS YET...BECAUSE STABLE AIR FROM BACKDOOR SYSTEMS STILL LOOKS VERY 
CLOSE BY...TO OUR SOUTH...SO MOISTURE COULD BE BLOCKED.  THIS WILL 
BE SOMETHING TO WATCH FOR LATER PERIODS.  ALSO, NO OBVIOUS FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTION CAN BE SEEN IN THE AREA EITHER.

NOT OFTEN WE SEE AN ENTIRE SEVEN DAY PERIOD WITH NO MENTION OF 
PRECIPITATION...WHICH STARTS TO MAKE FOR FIRE WEATHER CONCERNS.  
RELATIVE HUMIDITY VALUES GET PRETTY DRY ON SOME OF THE DAYS...BUT 
WINDS BEHAVE THEMSELVES FOR THE MOST PART THROUGH THIS PERIOD.  RH 
VALUES WILL LIKELY GO BELOW 35% AT MANY LOCATIONS ON A DAILY BASIS.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...DEPARTING UPPER TROUGH WILL GIVE 
WAY TO RIDGING ALOFT...WITH SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING IN.  
CLOUDS WILL GRADUALLY CLEAR OUT BY LATER TODAY...LEAVING A MAINLY 
CLEAR SKY OVERNIGHT.  SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SOME FROST 
ESPECIALLY NORTH AND SOUTHWEST NC/SE TN MOUNTAINS.  LOOKS LIKE 
ENOUGH OF A RISK TO ISSUE FROST ADVISORY THESE AREAS AT THIS

EXPANDED.   ELSEWHERE WILL INCLUDE PATCHY FROST MENTION...EXCEPT 
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL TN MOUNTAINS WHERE FREEZE PROGRAM HAS NOT 
STARTED YET.  WILL NOT STRAY FAR FROM MAV TEMPS.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...STAYED WITH A DRY FORECAST 
THROUGH THE PERIOD WITH UPPER LEVEL FLOW BECOMING ZONAL FOR A BRIEF 
TIME OVER THE WEEKEND. GRADUALLY THE PATTERN BEGINS TO AMPLIFY WHICH 
CAUSES UPPER LEVEL WINDS TO BECOME NORTHWESTERLY LATER SUNDAY NIGHT 
INTO MONDAY. THE MODELS INDICATE A WEAK AND MOISTURE STARVED FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY DROPS SOUTH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION WITH 
VERY LITTLE IMPACT. TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY UPPER LEVEL RIDGING 
BUILDS ACROSS THE CENTRAL INTO THE EASTERN U.S. KEEPING THE FORECAST 
DRY WHILE MAINTAINING PLEASANT TEMPERATURES IN THE 70S.

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEGUN TO 
DEVELOP IN WEST TN...WELL AHEAD OF THE SURFACE FRONT...WHICH IS 
LOCATED ACROSS CENTRAL MO AND AR. THIS APPEARS TO BE FASTER THAN THE 
MODELS DEPICT. AS A RESULT...WILL HAVE POPS HIGHER THAN MOS GUIDANCE 
TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST. WILL BRING POPS INTO OUR WESTERN 
COUNTIES AROUND MIDNIGHT...WITH LIKELY POPS A FEW HOURS LATER. WILL 
CONTINUE THE CATEGORICAL POPS FOR THURSDAY MORNING AND EARLY 
AFTERNOON. INSTABILITY LOOKS QUITE WEAK WITH MUCAPE UNDER 500 J/KG 
AND LI UNDER -2. THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
WITH GUSTY WINDS...BUT SEVERE POTENTIAL LOOKS MINIMAL. PRECIP 
APPEARS TO END QUICKLY ONCE THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH...WHICH LOOKS TO 
BE IN THE AFTERNOON. WITH COLD ADVECTION AND OVERCAST CLOUDS BEHIND 
THE FRONT...EXPECT THAT THE HIGH TEMPS FOR THE DAY WILL BE REACHED 
IN THE MORNING...AND TEMPS WILL FALL OR HOLD NEARLY STEADY THROUGH 
THE DAY. 

LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS MAY 
LINGER OVER THE AREA THURSDAY EVENING AS A COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO

248 PM EDT WED APR 7 2010

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND THURSDAY)...THUNDERSTORMS HAVE BEGUN TO 
DEVELOP IN WEST TN...WELL AHEAD OF THE SURFACE FRONT...WHICH IS 
LOCATED ACROSS CENTRAL MO AND AR. THIS APPEARS TO BE FASTER THAN THE 
MODELS DEPICT. AS A RESULT...WILL HAVE POPS HIGHER THAN MOS GUIDANCE 
TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY IN THE WEST. WILL BRING POPS INTO OUR WESTERN 
COUNTIES AROUND MIDNIGHT...WITH LIKELY POPS A FEW HOURS LATER. WILL 
CONTINUE THE CATEGORICAL POPS FOR THURSDAY MORNING AND EARLY 
AFTERNOON. INSTABILITY LOOKS QUITE WEAK WITH MUCAPE UNDER 500 J/KG 
AND LI UNDER -2. THIS SHOULD BE ENOUGH FOR A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS 
WITH GUSTY WINDS...BUT SEVERE POTENTIAL LOOKS MINIMAL. PRECIP 
APPEARS TO END QUICKLY ONCE THE FRONT MOVES THROUGH...WHICH LOOKS TO 
BE IN THE AFTERNOON. WITH COLD ADVECTION AND OVERCAST CLOUDS BEHIND 
THE FRONT...EXPECT THAT THE HIGH TEMPS FOR THE DAY WILL BE REACHED 
IN THE MORNING...AND TEMPS WILL FALL OR HOLD NEARLY STEADY THROUGH 
THE DAY. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A FEW SHOWERS MAY 
LINGER OVER THE AREA THURSDAY EVENING AS A COLD FRONT CONTINUES TO 
PULL AWAY FROM THE AREA.  BEHIND THE FRONT...MUCH COOLER AND DRIER 
AIR WILL SLIDE IN.  AFTERNOON HIGHS WILL DROP BELOW NORMAL LEVELS ON 
FRIDAY...WITH A WARMING TREND EXPECTED FOR THE WEEKEND.  A DRY AIR 
MASS AND A SURFACE HIGH WILL BE IN PLACE FOR MUCH OF THE 
EXTENDED...AND WILL PROVIDE DRY CONDITIONS FRIDAY THROUGH 
WEDNESDAY.

WARM AND DRY CONDITIONS PERSIST ACROSS THE AREA TODAY...PRODUCING
AN ELEVATED FIRE DANGER. RH WILL BE A BIT HIGHER TODAY COMPARED TO
YESTERDAY DUE TO CLOUD COVER AND SLIGHTLY HIGHER DEWPOINTS...BUT
MIN RH SHOULD STILL DROP BELOW 30 PERCENT IN MANY
AREAS...ESPECIALLY NORTH AND IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WINDS OF 10 TO
20 MPH WITH SOME GUSTS WILL ENHANCE THE FIRE DANGER AS WELL. A FIRE
DANGER STATEMENT HAS BEEN ISSUED TO ADDRESS THESE CONCERNS.

BRINGING DRY WEATHER TODAY. IT SHOULD BE ANOTHER WARM AND BREEZY DAY 
TODAY WITH HIGH TEMPERATURES AGAIN APPROACHING RECORD VALUES.  LOW

TONIGHT. WILL KEEP THE LIKELY POPS GOING FOR OUR WESTERN COUNTIES 
AND CHANCE FOR THE EAST FOR TONIGHT. STAYED NEAR GUIDANCE NUMBERS

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN FORECAST CONCERN IS 
UPPER TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT MOVING ACROSS THE FORECAST

BUT INSTABILITY IS MARGINAL. WILL CONTINUE WITH SHOWERS AND A CHANCE 
OF THUNDERSTORMS. CATEGORICAL COVERAGE OF CONVECTION ANTICIPATED. 
DUE TO TIMING OF FROPA...BELIEVE SEVERE CHANCES ARE LOW WITH THE 
MAIN CONCERN BEING STRONG WINDS. WILL CONTINUE TO MENTION CHANCE OF 
STRONG-SEVERE STORMS IN HWO...BUT CHANCES ARE LOW.

FOR THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY...LOW LEVEL MOISTURE MOVES EAST OF THE 
AREA WITH CLEARING. MUCH COOLER TEMPERATURES.

FOR SATURDAY THROUGH TUESDAY...UPPER AND SURFACE RIDGING WILL 
DOMINATE THE FORECAST PRODUCING AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER

GRADIENT WILL REMAIN TIGHT BETWEEN SURFACE HIGH OVER THE WESTERN

ILLINOIS FROM 18Z WEDNESDAY THROUGH 12Z THURSDAY...RESULTING IN A 
COLD FRONT BEING PUSHED ALSO EASTWARD TO THE SOUTH ACROSS MIDDLE AND 
INTO EAST TENNESSEE BY 12Z THURSDAY. 

WILL FOR NOW...CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR PLATEAU
COUNTIES AND KEEP REST OF THE FORECAST AREA DRY FOR NOW. NAM MODEL
SEEMS TO BE THE PREFERRED MODEL COMPARED TO GFS INVOLVING TIMING OF
THE SYSTEM. WITH THIS IN MIND...WILL ALSO INCREASE POPS INTO THE
LIKELY CATEGORY FOR THURSDAY...FROM WEST TO EAST THROUGH THE
DAY...BUT ACTUALLY LIKE GFS DEPICTION OF 4-5 HOUR TIME FRAME OF
PRECIP ALONG BOUNDARY. 

PROGRESSIVE UPPER TROUGH SHOULD SHIFT NORTHEAST BY FRIDAY...WITH
MID-UPPER LEVEL RIDGING AGAIN PROGGED BY MODELS TO SET UP ACROSS
THE SOUTHEAST U.S. FOR FRIDAY AND THROUGH WEEKEND. WILL NOT UP HIGH
TEMPS A CATEGORY YET FOR SUNDAY...BUT THIS WILL NEED TO BE WATCHED
FOR CONTINUITY SAKE AS PER GFS MODEL NUMBERS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SOME CONVECTION HAS 
DEVELOPED OVER THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION...AND SHORT RANGE 
MODELS SHOW AN AREA OF WARM AIR ADVECTION WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT 
OVERNIGHT. 12Z GFS MODEL HAS TRENDED MORE IN LINE WITH NAM IN 
SHOWING ANY CONVECTION FOR OUR REGION TO MOVE MAINLY ACROSS THE NRN 
2/3RDS OF THE FORECAST AREA. KEPT POPS JUST IN THE WRN AREAS TONIGHT
AND BELOW THE LIKELY NAM POPS FOR MONDAY. PREVIOUS GRIDS WITH CHANCE 
POPS ACROSS NRN PLATEAU AND SWRN VA BLENDED BETTER WITH NEIGHBORING 
NWS OFFICES TO OUR NORTH. MUCH MILDER FOR MINS TONIGHT WITH CLOUDS 
DEVELOPING AND LIGHT SOUTHERLY WINDS AS WELL...AND I TRENDED TOWARD 
THE GFS MOS MINS. 

BETTER MIXING THAN EXPECTED HAS LOWERED DEW POINT TEMPS CONSIDERABLY 
ACROSS THE AREA...BUT THOSE DEW POINTS SHOULD RECOVER OVERNIGHT...
AND REACH INTO THE MID 40S TO MID 50S ON MONDAY. SURFACE WINDS WILL 
PICK UP A BIT BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY...AS SURFACE RIDGE SHIFTS EAST 
TO THE SRN ATLANTIC AND SW LOW LEVEL FLOW DEVELOPS. MIN RH VALUES 
SHOULD STAY ABOVE CRITICAL VALUES ON MONDAY...BUT WARMER TEMPS ON 
TUESDAY SHOULD DROP MIN RH DOWN TO OR JUST BELOW CRITICAL VALUES ON 
TUESDAY. I WILL LET MIDNIGHT SHIFT TONIGHT AND DAYSHIFT MONDAY 
COORDINATE WITH FIRE AGENCIES ON THE NEED FOR A POSSIBLE FIRE DANGER 
STATEMENT...FOR MONDAY AND/OR TUESDAY AFTERNOON TO EARLY EVENING.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...NICE AMPLIFIED UPPER 
RIDGE KEEPS THE WEATHER RATHER NICE TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY AS 
FORECAST AREA AWAITS ADVANCE OF PLAINS STATES UPPER LEVEL TROF. WENT 
CLOSER TO ECMWF FROPA FOR THURSDAY WITH A GOOD CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS DURING THE DAY TAPERING BACK TO SLIGHT CHANCE FOR LATE 
THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY AS SOME TRAILING ENERGY DROPS IN BEHIND 
THE MAIN UPPER TROF. KEPT REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST DRY THROUGH 
SUNDAY AS DRIER/COOLER NORTHWEST FLOW BUILDS IN TO WRAP UP THE 
WEEKEND.

DRY AIR IN PLACE WITH JUST A SCANT AMOUNT OF CIRRUS CLOUDS. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS SUPPORT HIGHS FROM THE UPPER 60S TO AROUND 80 DEGREES.

OTHERWISE...WILL WATCH FOR SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION (PCPN) TO START 
TO DEVELOP TO OUR W AND NW...WHERE MODELS DEPICT ISENTROPIC LIFT

WILL PRODUCE A DRY AND WARM DAY. FLAT UPPER RIDGE WILL ALLOW FOR
PLENTY OF UPPER LEVEL CIRRUS...BUT OVERALL MOSTLY SUNNY. INCREASING
ISENTROPIC LIFT ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TONIGHT WILL PRODUCE A
CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE PLATEAU COUNTIES AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MINOR SHORT WAVE TROUGH AND 
ACCOMPANYING SURFACE FRONT APPROACH THE FORECAST AREA FROM THE NORTH 
ON MONDAY. NOT EXPECTING TOO MUCH IMPACT FROM THIS FEATURE AS IT 
STALLS JUST NORTH OF THE CWA. THUS MOST OF THE IMPACT WILL BE 
CONFINED TO OUR NORTHERN TIER AND HAVE INCREASED POPS TO CHANCE 
THERE. UPPER RIDGING RETURNS TO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION 
THROUGH THE MIDDLE OF THE WEEK WITH ACCOMPANYING WELL-ABOVE-CLIMO 
TEMPS. ANOTHER MORE SIGNIFICANT UPPER TROUGH AND SURFACE COLD FRONT 
APPROACH ON THURSDAY. EARLIER TIMING ISSUES HAVE LARGELY BEEN 
RESOLVED WITH THIS SYSTEM. LIGHT PRECIP LINGERS INTO FRIDAY AS UPPER 
TROUGH AXIS SHIFTS THROUGH THE REGION. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT 
DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE. TEMPS WILL BRIEFLY COOL

WARNING WHICH RUNS THRU 7 PM EDT. WIND SPEEDS MARGINAL THERE BUT RH

FAVORED MILDER MINS TONIGHT GIVEN CURRENT DEW POINTS AND LIGHT
WINDS. SUNNY AND CONTINUED WARM SUNDAY...DRY SUNDAY NIGHT...THEN 
ADDED A VERY LOW CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS NRN PLATEAU AND SW VA FOR
MONDAY AFTERNOON. NOT SURE WHAT MODELS ARE SHOWING OTHER THAN A
POSSIBLE WEAK DISTURBANCE TO OUR NORTH IN THE ZONAL FLOW...COUPLED

326 PM EDT FRI APR 2 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...MAIN CONCERN FOR THESE
PERIODS CONTINUES TO BE FIRE WEATHER DANGER ACROSS ESPECIALLY SW VA
SATURDAY AFTERNOON. LOW LEVEL JET BRIEFLY INCREASES LATE SATURDAY
MORNING AND AFTERNOON...TO GET SUSTAINED SPEEDS AROUND 20 MPH OR SO
WITH SOME HIGHER GUSTS...UNTIL THE FRONTAL PASSAGE VERY EARLY
SATURDAY EVENING.

HOWEVER...MOISTURE WILL INCREASE SLIGHTLY AHEAD OF THE FRONT...
AND ISOLATED TO SCATTERED LIGHT SHOWERS MAY ALSO DEVELOP. THE
INCREASED LOW LEVEL MOISTURE...PLUS SOME CLOUDINESS...WILL WORK TO
PRODUCE LOWEST AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES IN THE 30 TO 35 PERCENT RANGE. 

THUS...CONDITIONS MAY BRIEFLY REACH NEAR RED FLAG WARNING CRITERIA
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...ACROSS MOST OF SOUTHWESTERN VIRGINIA. WILL ALSO
RE-ISSUE SPS FOR FIRE DANGER IN CHEROKEE AND CLAY COUNTIES...ALTHO
WIND SPEEDS WON'T BE AS HIGH THERE...AND ALSO LOWEST RH WILL BE
QUITE HIGHER THAN TODAY (35 TO 45 PERCENT).

OTHERWISE...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS BACK INTO THE REGION RATHER
QUICKLY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY...SO DRY WEATHER EXCEPT FOR ONE
PERIOD. FAVORED WARMER MINS IN THE WRN SECTIONS TONIGHT AND WARMER
MAXES FOR NE TN AND SW VA ON SATURDAY. CHOSE A MOS BLEND FOR MINS
SATURDAY NIGHT WITH VERY WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION...AND GFS MOS
LOOKED GREAT FOR MAXES SUNDAY.

THANKS TO RNK FOR THE COORDINATION ON THE RED FLAG WATCH. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THE PERIOD STARTS OUT 
WITH A ZONAL FLOW BUT TRANSITIONS INTO A NICE AMPLIFYING RIDGE 
PATTERN ALL THE WAY OUT THROUGH MID WEEK. THIS RATHER EXTENDED 
PERIOD OF THE FORECAST WILL BE DRY AWAITING THE ARRIVAL OF THE NEXT 
UPPER TROF WHICH PRESSES INTO THE EASTERN U.S. LATER ON WEDNESDAY 
WITH A COLD FRONT BUILDING TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALCHIANS WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT INTO THURSDAY. KEPT POPS IN A LOW CHANCE RANGE FOR SHOWERS AND 
THUNDERSTORMS DURING THIS PERIOD DUE TO TIMING UNCERTAINTIES WITH 
THE AMPLIFIED PATTERN. BUT FROPA WILL OCCUR SOMETIME THURSDAY 
FOLLOWED BY SOME TRAILING SHORTWAVE ENERGY FOR LATER THURSDAY NIGHT 
INTO FRIDAY WHICH ACCOUNTS FOR THE SLIGHT CHANCE POP AT THIS TIME. 
TWEAKED MAX TEMPS JUST A LITTLE WARMER EARLY IN THE FORECAST WHILE 
ADJUSTING MINS DOWN A BIT DUE TO DRIER CONDITIONS EARLY ON.

.DISCUSSION...SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE HAVE SHIFTED SLIGHTLY EAST

TEMPERATURES WILL OCCUR THIS AFTERNOON. 12Z OHX/RNK SOUNDINGS SHOW 
TEMPS ALOFT HAVE WARMED AND MOST AREAS WILL REACH 70S TO MID 80S
...ALTHO HIGHEST ELEVATIONS MIGHT JUST GET TO MID OR UPPER 60S
(WHICH ARE SEASONAL NORMS FOR THE LOWER ELEVATIONS).

THE DRY AIRMASS ALLOWED MIN TEMPS TO FALL A FEW DEGREES BELOW EVEN 
THE COOLER MOS MINS FROM YESTERDAY'S 12Z MOS GUIDANCE. 

WEATHER LOOKS TO CHANGE BRIEFLY ON SATURDAY...WITH A VERY BRIEF 
BREEZY PERIOD SATURDAY AFTERNOON AND SOME WEAKENING SHOWERS MOVING

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE EASTERN SEABOARD... 
WITH AN ELONGATED AREA OF LOW PRESSURE OVER THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
PLAINS. THIS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL COMBINE WITH A STRONG 
UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST TO BRING ANOTHER WARM AND 
TRANQUIL DAY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. CONVECTION OVER THE PLAINS 
WILL LIKELY CREATE SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER THE TN RIVER VALLEY LATER 
THIS AFTERNOON AND INTO TONIGHT...BUT PROBABLY NOT ENOUGH TO MENTION 
PARTLY CLOUDY SKIES. TEMPS WILL ONCE AGAIN RISE INTO THE 80S AND 
POSSIBLY REACH CLOSE TO THE RECORDS FOR THIS DATE (CHA 88...TYS 
88...OQT 84...TRI 83). WILL ALSO PLAN TO REISSUE THE SPECIAL WEATHER 
STATEMENT MENTIONING HIGH FIRE DANGER TODAY DUE TO LOW AFTERNOON 
RELATIVE HUMIDITIES AND THE UNSEASONABLY WARM TEMPS. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WELL ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS 
EXPECTED TO PERSIST THROUGH MOST OF THE LONG TERM AS UPPER RIDGE 
HOLDS STRONG OVER THE EASTERN CONUS. A COUPLE OF WEAK SYSTEMS WILL
HAVE LIMITED SUCCESS IN OVERCOMING UPPER RIDGE BOTH ON SATURDAY AND
AGAIN MONDAY. APPEARS SATURDAY'S SYSTEM WILL WEAKEN AS IT TRAVERSES
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SO NOT EXPECTING ANYTHING
SIGNIFICANT AT THIS TIME. MONDAY'S SYSTEM ALSO APPEARS RELATIVELY
INSIGNIFICANT. DRY PERIOD ENSUES TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY BEFORE
ANOTHER POTENTIALLY MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM APPROACHES BY LATE IN
THE LONG TERM PERIOD. QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH RESPECT TO
TIMING WITH THIS SYSTEM. THUS HAVE SPREAD CHANCE POPS OVER SEVERAL
PERIODS. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FOLLOWED MAV/MEX FAIRLY CLOSELY.
APPEARS TEMPS WILL RETURN TO NEAR OR EVEN BELOW CLIMO WITH LATE
WEEK SYSTEM AS HEIGHTS FALL SIGNIFICANTLY.

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...UPPER RIDGE HOLDS STRONG ACROSS 
SE STATES INTO FRIDAY EVENING. SURFACE RIDGE AXIS ACROSS THE SRN AND 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS THIS AFTERNOON WILL SLIP EAST TO ALONG THE 
ATLANTIC COAST STATES BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON...WHICH WILL ALLOW A WEAK 
SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE PLATEAU LATE FRIDAY.
ELSEWHERE...CALM WINDS AT NIGHT AND VARAIBLE 5 TO 10 MPH DAYTIME 
FRIDAY. 

AFTERNOON HUMIDITIES WILL REMAIN LOW...BUT JUST ABOVE RED FLAG 
WARNING CRITERIA...WHILE WIND SPEEDS REMAIN WELL BELOW CRITERIA.
THUS...AN SPS TO HIGHLIGHT INCREASED FIRE DANGER FOR SW VA AND SW NC 
THROUGH THE WEEKEND WILL SUFFICE. 

DRY AIR ALLOWED A LARGE DIURNAL RANGE TODAY...WITH THURSDAY MINS 
DIPPING A TAD BELOW MOS IN GENERAL AND MAXES THUS FAR RUNNING BELOW 
ANY RECORD VALUES. GIVEN LAST NIGHT MINS...I TRENDED WITH OR JUST 
BELOW THE COOLER MOS MINS FOR TONIGHT. MOS HIGHS FOR FRIDAY ARE 
QUITE CLOSE AND LOOK VERY REASONABLE...AND SHOULD STAY BELOW RECORDS 
EXCEPT FOR TRI (82). RECORD HIGH FOR BOTH CHA AND TYS IS 88 DEGREES.

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...A WEAK COLD FRONT
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY AFTERNOON-EVENING.
UPPER SUPPORT WILL MOVE WELL WEST AND NORTH OF THE FORECAST AREA
AND MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED DUE TO RIDGING INTO THE GULF. WILL
KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE RANGE WITH HIGHEST IN THE WEST.

UPPER FLOW WILL BECOME ZONAL FOR SUNDAY WITH DRY AND CONTINUED WARM
WEATHER. FOR MONDAY...WINDS BECOME MORE SOUTHERLY ALLOWING GULF
MOISTURE TO RETURN. WILL INCLUDE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS AND
THUNDERSTORMS AS INSTABILITY RETURNS.

FOR TUESDAY...RIDGING RETURNS WITH VERY WARM AND DRY CONDITIONS.
FOR WEDNESDAY...ANOTHER FRONT MOVES TOWARD THE AREA. LOW CONFIDENCE
OF TIMING OF NEXT SYSTEM. WILL ONLY GO FOR CHANCE POPS FOR NOW.
BETTER MOISTURE RETURN FROM THE GULF WILL ALLOW FOR STRONG CONVECTION.

FOR THURSDAY...FRONT MOVES EAST WITH COOLER WEATHER.

AN UPPER TROUGH TRACKS FROM TEXAS TO THE GREAT LAKES SATURDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SKIES ARE CLEAR ACROSS THE
FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING WITH CALM WINDS. TEMPERATURES RANGE FROM
THE UPPER 20S TO MID 30S NE VALLEYS AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA
VALLEYS TO LOWER TO MID 40S ELSEWHERE. UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS
OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT WITH ONLY A FEW THIN HIGH
LEVEL CLOUDS AND WARMING TEMPERATURES. DRY AIR ALOFT WILL CAUSE
RAPID WARMING INTO THE 70S. SOME PLACES MAY BE NEAR 80 IN THE
SOUTHERN VALLEY. TONIGHT WITH FULL RADIATIONAL COOLING TEMPERATURES
WILL AGAIN DROP INTO THE MID 30S TO MID 40S. 

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A HIGH AMPLITUDE RIDGE WILL DOMINATE THE WEATHER PATTERN OVER THE 
EASTERN CONUS THROUGH FRIDAY. SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE RIDGE AXIS WILL 
GIVE CLEAR SKIES AND HIGHS IN THE UPPER 70S/LOWER 80S IN MOST SPOTS 
THURSDAY. THE RIDGE AXIS SHIFTS TOWARD THE COAST...PROVIDING A LIGHT 
SW FLOW THAT SHOULD BRING EVEN WARMER TEMPS FOR FRIDAY...WITH HIGHS 
IN THE LOWER/MID 80S IN THE VALLEY. RECORD HIGHS FOR FRIDAY ARE 
TRI-82...TYS-88...CHA-88 SO PROBABLY ONLY TRI WILL GET CLOSE TO A 
RECORD HIGH.

AN UPPER TROUGH WILL LIFT FROM THE DESERT SW TO THE GREAT LAKES FOR 
THE WEEKEND. THE MODELS CONTINUE TO HAVE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES 
WITH THIS SYSTEM...BUT ARE IN SLIGHTLY BETTER AGREEMENT THAN 
YESTERDAY. OVERALL THE MODELS SEEM TO BE CONVERGING TOWARD A 
SATURDAY NIGHT TIMING FOR FROPA. WILL BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN 
SATURDAY AFTERNOON...AND RAISE POPS SATURDAY NIGHT TO A CHANCE. WILL 
KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE POP IN SUNDAY DUE TO THE TIMING UNCERTAINTIES. 
A WEAK RIDGE SHOULD PROVIDE DRY AND MILD WEATHER EARLY NEXT WEEK.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OFF 
THE NORTHEAST COAST...WITH HIGH PRESSURE BUILDING OVER THE TN AND 
OHIO RIVER VALLEYS. THIS HIGH WILL BRING CLEAR SKIES AND LIGHT WINDS 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT...WITH TEMPS EXPECTED TO FALL 
CLOSE TO THE CURRENT DEWPOINTS. AS A RESULT...IT WOULD APPEAR THAT 
SOME PATCHY FOG MAY BE POSSIBLE TOWARDS SUNRISE...MAINLY NEAR THE 
WATERWAYS. HOWEVER...WILL NOT PLAN TO MENTION PATCHY FOG IN THE 
ZONES...SINCE THE RELATIVELY COOL WATER TEMPS THIS TIME OF YEAR MAY 
PREVENT ANY MEANINGFUL FOG DEVELOPMENT.

OVERALL...CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS TO BE ON TRACK AND WILL NOT PLAN TO

TUESDAY. CONTINUED SLIGHT CHANCE TO CHANCE POPS FOR ALL BUT THE 
SOUTHERN TIER OVERNIGHT...ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
EXPECTING DRY CONDITIONS EVERYWHERE BY THE SECOND PERIOD AS RIDGE 
BUILDS IN. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY FAVORED COOLER MET GUIDANCE SINCE 
REGION WILL REMAIN IN NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
THE FLOW ALOFT WILL BECOME INCREASINGLY AMPLIFIED THROUGH THE END OF 
THE WEEK...RESULTING IN A BUILDING RIDGE OVER THE EAST COAST. THIS 
WILL PROVIDE DRY WEATHER...CLEAR SKIES AND WARM TEMPERATURES THROUGH 
SATURDAY. WITH FULL SUN EXPECTED...HIGHS SHOULD REACH THE 80S IN 
MUCH OF THE TN VALLEY THURSDAY THROUGH SATURDAY. 

THE GENERAL MODEL CONSENSUS IS THAT A CLOSED LOW WILL CROSS THE 
DESERT SW...THEN LIFT NORTHEAST ACROSS THE MS AND LOWER OH 
VALLEYS...PUSHING A COLD FRONT THROUGH OUR AREA ON SATURDAY 
NIGHT/SUNDAY. THERE IS CONSIDERABLE SPREAD AMONG THE GFS ENSEMBLE 
MEMBERS WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND THE ECMWF IS QUITE A BIT SLOWER THAN 
THE OPERATIONAL GFS. HPC PROGS ARE ALSO CLOSER TO THE ECMWF. THUS 
PREFER THE SLOWER SOLUTION GIVEN THE STRENGTH OF THE RIDGE THAT WILL 
HAVE TO BE OVERCOME...SO WILL KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS ISOLATED TO 
SUNDAY. ANOTHER LARGE RIDGE LOOKS TO BUILD OVER THE REGION EARLY 
NEXT WEEK...SO WE MAY BE IN FOR AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF DRY AND WARM

ASSOCIATED CONVECTION FROM NEAR TYS NE TO 40 MILES WEST OF TRI.
BECAUSE PRECIP IS ABOUT OVER AT TYS THE FOCUS FOR A CB AND TSRA
WILL BE AT TRI FOR A COUPLE HOURS EARLY IN THE TAF. THEN THE TAF
SITES SHOULD BE GENERALLY PRECIP FREE UNTIL WRAP AROUND PRECIP WITH
TRAILING ENERGY BUILDS INTO EAST TENNESSEE LATER THIS EVENING. HAVE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER 
INDIANA WILL TRACK EAST...AND COLD FRONT WILL EXIT OUR AREA 
OVERNIGHT.  SECONDARY LOW WILL DEVELOP NEAR EAST COAST AND TRACK 
NORTHEAST.  SHOWER ACTIVITY WILL DIMINISH THIS EVENING...BUT MAY 
HAVE SOME PATCHES OF LIGHT RAIN/DRIZZLE AROUND THROUGH MONDAY.  MAY 
EVEN GET COLD ENOUGH OVER HIGHEST PEAKS FOR SOME FREEZING/FROZEN 
PRECIP.  WINDS WILL REMAIN GUSTY THIS AFTERNOON...BUT SHOULD 
DIMINISH THIS EVENING AND EXPECT WINDS TO GENERALLY BE BELOW WIND 
ADVISORY CRITERIA...SO WILL LET WARNINGS/ADVISORIES EXPIRE ON 
SCHEDULE.    


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN 
REGION STILL ON TRACK FOR MAJOR PATTERN SHIFT WITH UPPER AIR FLOW 
AND ACCOMPANYING HEIGHTS BECOMING MORE REMINISCENT OF SUMMER 
PATTERN. EFFECTS OF SYSTEM CURRENTLY MOVING ACROSS THE REGION 
EXPECTED TO END BY EARLY TUESDAY AFTER WHICH UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO 
BUILD IN. RIDGE CONTINUES TO AMPLIFY OVER THE REGION INTO NEXT 
WEEKEND IN RESPONSE TO AMPLIFYING UPPER TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHWESTERN 
CONUS. AS A RESULT...DRY WEATHER WITH WELL ABOVE CLIMO TEMPS 
EXPECTED THROUGH MUCH OF THE LONG TERM. A SYSTEM DOES APPROACH BY 
LATE NEXT WEEKEND BUT TIMING AND INTENSITY STILL IN QUESTION AT THIS 
POINT. DID INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NEXT SUNDAY HOWEVER. FOR 
TEMPS...AGAIN DID NOT DEVIATE TOO SIGNIFICANTLY FROM MAV/MEX 
GUIDANCE BUT DID BUMP UP MAX VALUES SLIGHTLY TO ACCOUNT FOR 
ANTICIPATED NEAR-SUMMERTIME HEIGHTS ACCOMPANYING UPPER RIDGE.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER 
THE OZARKS REGION...WITH AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WEDGED EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS OVER THE CAROLINAS AND MID ATLANTIC STATES. LOCAL OBS 
REVEAL A TIGHTENING PRESSURE GRADIENT DEVELOPING OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS BETWEEN THESE TWO SYSTEMS...WITH WIND TOWERS IN THE 
FOOTHILLS ALREADY REPORTING WINDS WELL INTO THE ADVISORY RANGE. THE 
COMBINATION OF A SOUTHEASTERLY WIND FLOW AND A STABLE AIR MASS OVER 
THE MOUNTAINS WILL PRODUCE A GOOD SCENARIO FOR MOUNTAIN WAVES 
TONIGHT INTO EARLY SUNDAY AFTERNOON. THUS...HAVE UPDATED THE WIND 
ADVISORY FOR THE MOUNTAINS AND THEIR ADJACENT FOOTHILLS TO BEGIN 
IMMEDIATELY. THERE IS SOME CONCERN THAT WINDS MAY STRENGTHEN FURTHER 
OVERNIGHT INTO THE HIGH WIND WARNING CRITERIA...BUT CONFIDENCE IS 
NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO ISSUE...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH AN ADVISORY FOR 
NOW. 

FURTHER WEST...A SOLID LINE OF STRONG CONVECTION HAS DEVELOPED OVER 
ARKANSAS AHEAD OF A COLD FRONT WHICH EXTENDS SOUTHWEST OF THE OZARKS 
LOW. THIS PRE-FRONTAL CONVECTION WILL LIKELY RACE AHEAD OF THE COLD 
FRONT OVERNIGHT...AND BE LOCATED AROUND THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU 
TOWARDS SUNRISE. THIS CONVECTION SHOULD WEAKEN LATER TONIGHT AS IT 
MOVES INTO A MORE STABLE ENVIRONMENT OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THUS... 
CURRENT FORECAST WHICH MENTIONS SHOWERS AFTER MIDNIGHT LOOKS TO BE 
ON TRACK...BUT WILL TWEAK THE WORDING TO MENTION 'TOWARDS SUNRISE'.

SOUTHWEST...WILL CARRY HIGHEST POPS THERE AND MINIMAL POPS NORTHEAST

TIME CONFIDENCE NOT HIGH ENOUGH TO ISSUE A HIGH WIND WARNING.  WILL 
KEEP WIND ADVISORY FOR HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND EXTEND THE AREA WEST TO 
INCLUDE SOME OF THE FOOTHILLS.  MAV TEMPS LOOK REASONABLE FOR THE 
MOST PART SO WILL STAY CLOSE.   


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...DRAMATICALLY IMPROVING 
CONDITIONS EXPECTED AFTER TOMORROW'S SYSTEM PULLS OUT AS IMPRESSIVE 
HEIGHT RISES ARE PROJECTED BY MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. STILL 
EXPECT PRECIP TO LINGER INTO MONDAY NIGHT AS UPPER LOW SLOWLY DRIFTS 
THROUGH THE REGION ON MONDAY. UPPER RIDGING WILL THEN BUILD INTO THE 
REGION BY MID WEEK WITH RIDGE AMPLIFYING IN RESPONSE TO HIGHLY 
AMPLIFIED TROUGH OVER THE WESTERN CONUS. THE ECMWF MODEL PROJECTS 
500 MB HEIGHTS OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION OF >5860 METERS 
WHICH ARE MORE TYPICAL OF SUMMER. THUS ANTICIPATE TEMPS TO AVERAGE 
WELL ABOVE CLIMO BY LATE WORK WEEK AND INTO EARLY NEXT WEEKEND. ONCE 
AGAIN HAVE BUMPED UP GUIDANCE MAX TEMPS SLIGHTLY FOR LATE IN THE 
LONG TERM BASED ON THE PROJECTED HEIGHT RISES. OTHERWISE...GENERALLY 
STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO MAV/MEX GUIDANCE VALUES. ANOTHER SYSTEM
APPROACHES OUR REGION BY NEXT WEEKEND...BUT TIMING ISSUES ABOUND

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD START THIS MORNING WITH HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGE EXTENDING WELL SOUTHWEST THROUGH THE APPALACHIANS. 
DRY CONDITIONS WILL CONTINUE TODAY. PLENTY OF SUNSHINE AND AFTERNOON 
WAA WILL ALLOW TEMPS TO RISE TO ABOVE NORMAL. RIDGING SHIFTS EAST BUT 
REMAINS STRONG EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS. LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVES 
TO WEST KY LATE TONIGHT. LOW LEVEL SOUTHERLY JET INCREASES TO IN 
EXCESS OF 50 KTS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY TONIGHT. CONFIDENCE 
HIGH FOR WINDY CONDITIONS DEVELOPING OVERNIGHT ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. SHOWERS AND THUNDERSTORMS WILL ADVANCE EAST INTO THE

NGT. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A STRONG WEATHER SYSTEM WILL 
APPROACH THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION EARLY IN THE EXTENDED.  
WINDS WILL INCREASE AS THE SYSTEM MOVES IN AND EXPECT MOUNTAIN 
LOCATIONS TO SEE WINDS REACH INTO ADVISORY CRITERIA FOR MUCH OF THE 
DAY SUNDAY.  ADDITIONALLY... ASSOCIATED PRECIP WILL SLIDE IN.  THERE 
REMAINS SOME DISCREPANCY WITH TIMING AND DETAILS OF SYSTEM BUT WILL 
KEEP WITH A COMPROMISE AND BRING WIDESPREAD RAIN INTO THE AREA ON 
SUNDAY.  WITH GOOD WIND SHEAR AND WEAK INSTABILITY...WILL HAVE 
CHANCE THUNDERSTORMS AS WELL.  WINDS SHOULD DECREASE SUNDAY NIGHT 
WITH SHOWERS BECOMING MORE SCATTERED IN NATURE.  BY MONDAY...A FEW 
SHOWERS WILL LINGER OVER THE AREA AS THE UPPER LOW SWINGS THROUGH.  
WILL MOVE INTO A DRY WEATHER PATTERN TUESDAY THROUGH THE REST OF THE

WHICH CONTINUE TO REPRESENT A REASONABLE COMPROMISE OF THE TWO

CANADIAN ENSEMBLES ALSO. BALANCE OF THE WORK WEEK APPEARS DRY AT THIS

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...THOUGHT THE GFS WAS A LITTLE TOO 
ENERGETIC IN BRINGING PRECIP INTO THE FORECAST AREA SO EARLY THIS 
MORNING BUT A CHECK OF THE RADAR SCOPE INDICATES IT HAD POSSIBLY A 
LITTLE BETTER HANDLE ON TODAY'S ACTION. SORT OF A ONE TWO PUNCH AS 
INITIAL SHORT WAVE FEATURE PRESSES INTO THE FORECAST AREA. STAYED 
WITH A CHANCE FOR CONVECTION WESTERN SECTIONS WITH THIS INITIAL 
WAVE. MAIN LIFT WITH PLAINS STATES UPPER TROF AND ASSOCIATED COLD 
FRONT STRENGTHENS LATER TODAY INTO TONIGHT SO KEPT POPS RATHER HIGH 
FOR THE BIG FROPA. SPREAD CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ACROSS MUCH OF THE 
SOUTHWESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA LATER TODAY AND TONIGHT BUT 
MODELS DON'T DEPICT A GREAT DEAL OF INSTABILITY. UPPER TROF SHIFTS 
ONLY SLOWLY EAST TONIGHT SO ONLY GRADUALLY DECREASE POP WITH BETTER 
CHANCE NORTHERN AND EASTERN SECTIONS AS DRIER AIR FILTERS IN ACROSS 
SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA. STAYED RELATIVELY 
CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR THE MAX AND MIN.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER TROUGH AXIS WILL PUSH 
TO OUR EAST FRIDAY MORNING...AND ANY CHANCE OF PRECIP SHOULD END 
BEFORE NOON ON FRIDAY. A HIGH AMPLITUDE RIDGE WILL MOVE ACROSS THE 
AREA FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY. SUBSIDENCE UNDER THE RIDGE WILL 
PROVIDE MOSTLY CLEAR SKIES. 

CLOUDS WILL BEGIN TO INCREASE SATURDAY NIGHT ONCE THE RIDGE AXIS 
MOVES EAST AND MOISTURE ADVECTION PICKS UP AHEAD OF A LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS. THE GFS DEPICTS THIS SYSTEM TRANSITIONING 
FROM A CLOSED LOW TO AN OPEN WAVE AS IT APPROACHES...BUT THE ECMWF 
KEEPS THE CLOSED LOW IN TACT AS IT PASSES BY. THUS THE GFS SOLUTION 
HAS TRENDED FASTER. THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE FASTER SOLUTION. WILL TREND THE FORECAST IN THIS DIRECTION 
AS WELL...AND BRING CHANCE POPS IN LATE SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL HAVE 
LIKELY POPS ON SUNDAY WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS. WHILE THE 
INSTABILITY LOOKS MARGINAL...THERE IS GOOD UPPER DIVERGENCE AT THE 
NOSE OF A JET STREAK...AS WELL AS A 50 KT LLJ. IF THE FASTER GFS IS 
CORRECT...PRECIP WILL COME TO AN END EARLY SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT THE 
ECMWF HAS THE CLOSED LOW OVER OUR AREA INTO MONDAY. WILL TREND POPS 
DOWNWARD ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...BUT KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE IN TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THE ECMWF SOLUTION. NO CHANCES TO TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY 
AS THE MODELS CONTINUE TO SHOW A RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
CLOSED UPPER LOW HAS MOVED WELL EAST OF THE AREA...AND ONLY A FEW 
LIGHT SHOWERS ARE SEEN ON RADAR ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. 
TEMPERATURES IN THAT AREA ARE IN THE MID 30S...SO A FEW SNOW SHOWERS 
ARE POSSIBLE THIS MORNING. BUT ANY CHANCE OF PRECIP SHOULD END BY 
NOON AS THE DEPARTING LOW MOVES FARTHER EAST AND MOISTURE DEPTH 
DECREASES. WE WILL HAVE A GOOD PRESSURE GRADIENT ACROSS THE 
AREA...AND NORTHWEST WINDS COULD APPROACH ADVISORY CRITERIA IN THE 
MOUTNAINS. AT THIS TIME IT LOOKS LIKE SUSTAINED WINDS WILL STAY 
PREDOMINANTLY IN THE 15 TO 25 MPH RANGE...SO WILL NOT GO WITH AN 
ADVISORY AT THE MOMENT. MORING CLOUDS SHOULD GIVE WAY TO MOSTLY 
SUNNY SKIES BY THE AFTERNOON AS CLOUDS GRADUALLY DECREASE FROM WEST 
TO EAST. 

A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE BUILDS OVER THE AREA FOR WEDNESDAY...PRODIVING 
CLEAR SKIES AND MILD TEMPERATURES. HIGHS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO 
LOWER 70S IN MOST SPOTS. THE FLOW BECOMES MORE SOUTHERLY ON THURSDAY 
AS THE RIDGE MOVES EAST...BRINGING GREATER MOISTURE ADVECTION. THE 
MODELS SHOW A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKING EAST ACROSS THE MID MS 
VALLEY REGION ON THURSDAY...AND THIS SHOULD BRING A CHANCE POP TO 
OUR WESTERN COUNTIES BY THURSDAY AFTERNOON...FOLLOWED BY LIKELY POPS 
THURSDAY NIGHT AS THE LOW TRACKS INTO KY. THIS TIMING IS FASTER THAN 
PREVIOUS FORECASTS...BUT THE MODELS SEEM TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS FAIRLY SIMILAR IN DEPICTION OF DEAMPLIFYING UPPER TROF
BUILDING EAST ACROSS THE MID SOUTH ON FRIDAY. SURFACE SYSTEM SHIFTS
SOUTHEAST AWAY FROM THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY AND USED HIGHER
CHANCE CATEGORY POPS FOR POSSIBLE CONVECTION DECREASING TO SLIGHT
CHANCE FRIDAY NIGHT AS TRAILING UPPER LOW MOVES ACROSS THE
MOUNTAINS INTO THE MIDDLE ATLANTIC STATES. RIDGING STILL IN ORDER
FOR SATURDAY WHICH WILL MAINTAIN THE BRIEF PERIOD OF DRY WEATHER.
NEXT UPPER TROF PRESSES EAST ACROSS THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ON
SUNDAY AND PREFERRED THE SLIGHTLY SLOWER ECMWF AND CANADIAN
SOLUTION WHICH HOLDS OFF MAIN EVENT UNTIL LATE SUNDAY OR SUNDAY
NIGHT. THEREFORE GRADUALLY ADJUSTED POPS FROM SLIGHT SUNDAY MORNING
THROUGH MEDIUM CHANCE SUNDAY NIGHT AS SURFACE COLD FRONT MAKES ITS
MOVE INTO THE FORECAST AREA. ALSO MAINTAINED MEDIUM CHANCE POP FOR
MONDAY IN LINE WITH SLOWER ECMWF SYSTEM MOVEMENT. STAYED RELATIVELY
CLOSE TO PREVIOUS TEMP FORECAST.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL BE CROSSING THE AREA TODAY AND TONIGHT. THE 
FORCING ASSOCIATED WITH THE SURFACE FRONT HAS PASSED THROUGH...AND 
THE MAIN LIFTING MECHANISM TODAY WILL BE STEEPENING LAPSE RATES AS 
THE MIDLEVEL COLD POOL MOVES ACROSS. MODELS INDICATE THIS LIFT TO BE 
QUITE WEAK. MOISTURE IS NOT VERY DEEP EITHER...CONFINED BELOW 700 
MB. SO WHILE SHOWERS SHOULD BE NUMEROUS...ESPECIALLY THIS 
AFTERNOON...THE PRECIP AMOUNTS ARE EXPECTED TO BE LIGHT...MAINLY A 
TENTH OF AN INCH OR LESS AREA-WIDE. WITH 850 MB TEMPS DROPPING TO 
-6C TODAY AND MOISTURE EXTENDING UP TO -12C...SOME SNOW SHOWERS WILL 
BE POSSIBLE IN THE MOUNTAINS. WITH LIGHT QPF...DO NOT EXPECT MUCH 
ACCUMULATION...POSSIBLY UP TO 1 INCH IN THE HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. 
CLOUDY SKIES TODAY COMBINED WITH COLD ADVECTION WILL KEEP 
TEMPERATURES NEARLY STEADY TODAY IN THE 40S...WITH 30S IN THE 
MOUNTAINS. THE CLOSED LOW WILL BE EXITING THE AREA TONIGHT. THE 
RESULTING STABILIZATION AND DECREASING MOISTURE DEPTH WILL LOWER THE 
POPS TO A CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AS THE  UPPER LOW EXITS THE 
REGION ON TUESDAY...SOME LINGERING MOISTURE MAY BRING MORE 
PRECIPITATION EARLY ON TUESDAY AND MAINLY IN THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF 
THE CWA.  A BRIEF PERIOD OF LIGHT SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE ON TUESDAY 
MORNING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  BUT LITTLE OR NO SNOW 
ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED.  A WEAK FRONT TRACKS INTO THE NORTHERN 
PORTIONS OF THE CWA ON WEDNESDAY AND LINGERS ON THURSDAY...BUT 
MOISTURE IS LIMITED SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR 
WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. A STRONGER FRONT TRACKS INTO REGION ON 
FRIDAY...SO WILL KEEP THE CHANCE POPS GOING FOR FRIDAY.  HIGH 
PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR SATURDAY.  ANOTHER FRONT 
APPROACHES THE CWA LATE ON SUNDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE THE SLIGHT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...DEEP UPPER TROUGH WILL
MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS TONIGHT
AND MONDAY...THEN OFF THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST BY LATE TUESDAY. 

ONE OF THE MAIN CONCERNS WITH THIS SYSTEM IS THE TIGHT PRESSURE
GRADIENT AROUND THE AREA OF LOW PRESSURE PRODUCING A 50-60KT JET AT
850MB. THE SOUTHEAST COMPONENT OF THE WIND FIELD ACROSS THE
MOUNTAINS AND MOUNTAIN VALLEYS WILL PRODUCE STRONG AND GUSTS WIND
NEAR 55KTS. HAVE ISSUED A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS
AND ADJACENT FOOTHILS FOR THIS EVENING (SOUTH) AND OVERNIGHT
(NORTH).

COLD FRONT...CURRENTLY OVER ALABAMA...WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST
AREA THIS EVENING-EARLY MORNING. A BAND OF SHOWERS WILL ACCOMPANY
THE FRONT WITH A CHANCE OF THUNDER FOR THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF
THE FORECAST AREA.

PLENTY OF COLD AIR STRATO-CU WILL TRAIL BEHIND FRONT AND WILL
PERSIST OF THE AREA THROUGH TUESDAY MORNING. ALSO...ENOUGH LOW
LEVEL INSTABIILTY TO PRODUCE SCT-BKN SHOWERS FOR MONDAY AND MONDAY
NIGHT. ALSO...UPSLOPE FLOW INTO THE MOUNTAINS MONDAY AND EARLY
TUESDAY MORNING WILL KEEP CHANCE OF SHOWERS GOING. MODELS DO SHOW A
WEAK-MODERATE DEFORMATION ZONE MOVING THROUGH ON MONDAY AS WELL...THUS
HAVE TRENDED TOWARD THE MORE AGGRESSIVE NAM PCPN SOLUTION.

TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL SUPPORT A MIXTURE OR CHANGE TO SNOW FOR
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AS WELL AS THE PLATEAU COUNTIES FOR MONDAY
AND MONDAY NIGHT. SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE FOR THE
HIGHER TERRAIN.

FOR TUESDAY...LOW CLOUDS WILL SLOWLY ERODE FROM THE SOUTHWEST
ALLOWING TEMPERATURES TO WARM.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...WEAK HIGH PRESSURE WILL 
BUILD IN EARLY IN THE EXTENDED FOR A RETURN TO DRY AND WARM 
CONDITIONS ON WEDNESDAY.  A WEAK DISTURBANCE SLIDES THROUGH TO OUR 
NORTH ON WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...BUT MOISTURE AND LIFT 
RATHER LIMITED AND WILL KEEP FORECAST DRY FOR NOW.  THE NEXT SYSTEM 
SHOULD PUSH INTO THE REGION AROUND THE FRIDAY TIMEFRAME.  
CONFIDENCE LOW ON TIMING...SO HAVE CONTINUED WITH LOW POPS THURSDAY 
NIGHT AND FRIDAY NIGHT...AND CHANCE ON FRIDAY.   KEPT SATURDAY DRY 
WITH ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHING THE AREA FOR SUNDAY.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION

419 AM EDT SUN MAR 21 2010

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE LOWER MS VALLEY WILL SPREAD PRECIP 
ACROSS MUCH OF THE AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND TONIGHT. LIGHT RAIN 
SHOWERS SHOULD BEGIN TO MOVE INTO THE SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA 
BY LATE MORNING IN ASSOCIATION WITH MIDLEVEL FRONTOGENESIS AND 
INCREASING UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE JET EXIT REGION. DOWNSLOPE WINDS 
WILL DELAY THE ONSET OF PRECIP IN NORTHERN AND CENTRAL LOCATIONS 
UNTIL LATE AFTERNOON. THUS THE BRISTOL AREA WILL LIKELY REMAIN DRY 
FOR MOST OF THE DAY...AND MAY ONLY SEE LIGHT RAIN SHOWERS LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON...ONLY A FEW HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH BEFORE SUNSET. THE 
DOWNSLOPE FLOW WILL ALSO CONTRIBUTE TO MILD TEMPERATURES...AND WILL 
GO ABOVE MOS GUIDANCE IN THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL TN VALLEY TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THIS. WARMEST TEMPERATURES WILL LIKELY BE IN THE 
NORTHERN VALLEY TODAY.

HEAVIER SHOWERS WILL ARRIVE IN SOUTHERN SECTIONS IN THE LATE 
AFTERNOON/EVENING AND SPREAD NORTHWARD THROUGH MIDNIGHT AS MOISTURE 
ADVECTION STRENGTHENS IN CONJUNCTION WITH THE LLJ. THE 30-40 KT LLJ 
MAY ALSO BRING WINDS TO NEAR ADVISORY LEVEL IN THE MOUNTAINS LATE 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT IT APPEARS MARGINAL ENOUGH AND LATE ENOUGH 
TO LET THE DAY SHIFT MONITOR AND EVALUATE LATER. INSTABILITY AND LOW 
LEVEL FORCING NEAR THE SURFACE FRONT MAY BE JUST ENOUGH IN SOUTHERN 
AND CENTRAL SECTIONS TO PRODUCE ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THE PASSAGE 
OF THE COLD FRONT LOOKS TO BE BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z TONIGHT. 850 MB 
TEMPS DROP RAPIDLY BEHIND THE FRONT...AND THIS MAY LEAD TO SOME OF 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS CHANGING TO SNOW LATE TONIGHT. DO NOT EXPECT 
MUCH IF ANY ACCUMULATION BEFORE 12Z.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE FRONT EXITS THE REGION 
EARLY MONDAY FOLLOWED BY AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ALOFT WHICH TRACKS 
THROUGH THE REGION ON MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT. WILL CONTINUE THE 
40-60 POPS GOING FOR MONDAY THEN 50-60 POPS FOR MONDAY NIGHT WITH 
THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  SHOULD HAVE COOLER WEATHER ON 
MONDAY.  AS THE  UPPER LOW EXITS THE REGION ON MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY...A BRIEF PERIOD OF LIGHT SNOW WILL BE POSSIBLE ON MONDAY 
NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  RIDGING 
RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY.  ANOTHER FRONT 
APPROACHES THE CWA ON THURSDAY...BUT MOISTURE IS LIMITED SO WILL 
CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR THURSDAY. A STRONGER FRONT TRACKS 
INTO REGION ON FRIDAY...SO WILL KEEP THE LOW CHANCE POPS GOING FOR 
FRIDAY.  HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR SATURDAY.  
STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...STRONG UPPER TROUGH ACROSS
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WILL MOVE ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES TO THE SOUTHERN
APPALACHIANS THROUGH MONDAY. STRONG DYNAMICS WITH THE SYSTEM WILL
PULL MOISTURE BACK ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WITH 850MB JET OF
50-60KTS BY LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. SHOWERS ARE LIKELY...BUT
LIMITED INSTABILITY WILL KEEP THUNDER CHANCES MINIMAL. BEST
INSTABILITY WILL BE ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES AND FAR SOUTHEAST
UNITED STATES. 

STRONG LOW LEVEL JET WILL PRODUCE DOWNSLOPING WINDS INTO THE
NORTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY WHICH WILL LIMIT RAINFALL UNTIL SURFACE
FRONT MOVES ACROSS LATE SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT. ONE OF THE BIGGEST
CONCERNS WILL BE POTENTIAL OF STRONG DAMAGING WINDS DUE TO THE
850MB JET OF 50-60KTS. WINDS ARE APPROACHING HIGH WIND WATCH
CRITERIA FOR THE FAR EASTERN TENNESSEE MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT
FOOTHILLS.

FOR MONDAY...UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
ALLOWING THE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE TO SUPPORT CHANCE OF SNOW
SHOWERS ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...INCLUDING THE PLATEAU COUNTIES.
ENOUGH LOW LEVEL INSTABILITY LIFT TO PRODUCE A CHANCE OF SHOWERS
AREA-WIDE.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS NUMBERS EXCEPT FOR MONDAY. DUE TO THE
CLOUDS...PRECIPITATION...AND COLD AIR ADVECTION...HAVE GONE A CAT
OR TWO BELOW MOS HIGHS.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...AS AN UPPER LOW PULLS 
AWAY FROM THE REGION EARLY IN THE EXTENDED...LIGHT SCATTERED SHOWERS 
WILL LINGER OVER THE MRX CWA.  SHOWERS WILL SLOWLY END FROM SOUTH TO 
NORTH LATE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY.  BEHIND THE SYSTEM...HIGH 
PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN FOR A RETURN TO DRY AND WARM CONDITIONS ON 
WEDNESDAY.  A WEAK DISTURBANCE WILL SLIDE THROUGH ON WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...FLATTENING THE RIDGE...BUT ENERGY AND MOISTURE SHOULD BE 
TOO LIMITED FOR ANYTHING OTHER THAN A FEW BANDS OF CLOUDS.  THE 
RIDGE REBOUNDS THURSDAY.  THE NEXT SYSTEM IS PROGGED INTO THE AREA 
LATE IN THE PERIOD.  CONFIDENCE LOW ON TIMING BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY AND GO DRY FOR SATURDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL MOVE OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST TODAY WHILE A 
STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TAKES SHAPE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. 
THIS WILL PUT THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION IN A SOUTHWESTERLY 
FLOW...PROVIDING EVEN WARMER TEMPERATURES TODAY. THOUGH THERE MAY BE 
SOME THIN HIGH CLOUDS...THEY SHOULD HAVE LITTLE IMPACT ON 
TEMPERATURES...WITH THE SOUTHERN VALLEY NEARING THE MID 70S. MOST 
OTHER LOCATIONS OUTSIDE THE MOUNTAINS WILL BE IN THE UPPER 60S TO 
LOWER 70S.

CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING THIS EVENING AS MIDLEVEL MOISTURE AND LIFT 
INCREASE AHEAD OF A CLOSED LOW TO OUR WEST. THE LIFT REMAINS WEAK 
BEFORE 12Z SUNDAY AND MOST PRECIP SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL AFTER THAT 
TIME. WILL CUT THE POPS BACK TONIGHT TO ONLY A SLIGHT CHANCE WEST 
AFTER 09Z. THERE ARE SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE NAM AND GFS 
THAT GIVE SOME UNCERTAINTY REGARDING THE ONSET OF PRECIP...WITH THE 
GFS BEING FASTER...BUT DRY LOW LEVEL AIR WILL NEED TO BE OVERCOME 
BEFORE PRECIP CAN REACH THE GROUND TONIGHT.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...A FRONT ENTERS THE AREA ON 
SUNDAY BRINGING AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE WITH IT.  WILL KEEP LIKELY 
TO CATEGORICAL POPS FOR SUNDAY.  SOME INSTABILITY IS ALSO EXPECTED SO 
WILL MENTION THUNDER FOR THE AFTERNOON HOURS.  AN UPPER LOW ENTERS 
THE REGION ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY. WILL CONTINUE THE LIKELY POPS 
GOING FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY WITH HIGHEST 
CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  SHOULD HAVE COOLER WEATHER ON MONDAY.  THE 
UPPER LOW EXITS THE REGION ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.  WITH BRIEF 
LIGHT SNOW POSSIBLE ON MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  RIDGING RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR 
WEDNESDAY.  ANOTHER FRONT APPROACHES THE CWA ON THURSDAY...BUT 
MOISTURE IS LIMITED SO WILL CONTINUE WITH A DRY FORECAST FOR 
THURSDAY. A STRONGER FRONT TRACKS INTO REGION ON FRIDAY...SO WILL 
KEEP THE LOW CHANCE POPS GOING FOR FRIDAY.  STAYED NEAR MEX/HPC

NIGHT.  MODELS NOW SHOWING A SLIGHTLY DESTABILIZED AIR MASS WITH THE

SLIDE THROUGH AND USHER IN COOLER AIR AND SOME LINGERING SCATTERED 
SHOWERS FOR MONDAY.  HAVE ADDED A SLIGHT CHANCE OF POPS OVER THE 
NORTHEAST AND EASTERN MOUNTAINS ON TUESDAY AS THE SYSTEM PULLS AWAY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...QUASI-PERSISTENT UPPER LOW OVER 
SOUTHEAST U.S. MOVING OUT TO SEA AS SHORT RIDGE BUILDS INTO OHIO AND 
TENNESSEE VALLEYS. SURFACE HIGH MOVES OVER AREA AND CUTS OFF FLOW OF 
MOISTURE INTO REGION. TEMPS WARM BACK UP TO NEAR NORMAL VALUES FOR 
THE SEASON. HAVE LEFT MIN TEMPS TONIGHT A BIT ON THE COOL SIDE WITH 
RADIATIONAL COOLING TAKING OVER AFTER CLOUDS MOVE OUT AND WIND FIELD 
GOES SLACK. 


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...GREAT WEATHER STILL IN
THE OFFING FOR FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY AS RIDGING DOMINATES. MAIN
SYSTEM WILL BE THE CLOSED UPPER LOW DEVELOPING OVER THE LOWER
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION SATURDAY NIGHT. BOTH THE GFS AND ECMWF
NOW CLOSE OFF THIS SYSTEM...WHICH MAY KEEP MEASURABLE PRECIPITATION
(PCPN) WEST OF OUR FORECAST AREA THROUGH 12Z SUNDAY. 

SLOWER TIMING STILL WOULD FAVOR LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL POPS BY
SUNDAY AFTERNOON...BUT WAS HESITANT TO GO ANY HIGHER THAN THE
UPPER END OF LIKELY FOR NOW. BEST THREAT OF THUNDERSTORMS LOOKS TO
BE ACROSS THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY AND GULF COAST REGION...SO I
DID NOT ADD THUNDERSTORMS YET TO SUNDAY AFTERNOON OR EVENING.

A RAIN AND/OR SNOW SHOWER MIX IS POSSIBLE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO
EARLY MONDAY (SW VA AND HIGHER TERRAIN OF E TN/SW NC)...BUT ECMWF
LOOKS A BIT TOO WARM...AND MUCH DEPENDS ON THE ACTUAL TRACK AND
TIMING. OTHERWISE...UPPER RIDGE MAKES A QUICK RETURN FOR TUESDAY
AND WEDNESDAY. VERY MINOR TEMPERATURE TWEAKS IN LINE WITH LATEST
GFSX MOS.

.SHORT TERM...UPPER TROUGH MOVING ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES WILL 
PRODUCING WEAK ISENTROPIC LIFT AND DEFORMATION ZONE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN HALF OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA.
THE WEAK LIFT IS PRODUCING LIGHT SHOWERS GENERALLY SOUTH OF MRX.

THIS LIFT WILL CONTINUE THROUGH MID-MORNING THURSDAY...SO WILL 
CONTINUE WITH A CHANCE OF SHOWERS GENERALLY ALONG AND SOUTH OF 
INTERSTATE 40.

FOR THURSDAY...UPPER TROUGH MOVES EAST ALLOWING SKY TO CLEAR FROM 
NORTH TO SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA.  THE RETURN OF SOME 
SUNSHINE WILL ALLOW TEMPERATURES TO WARM-UP INTO THE 60S IN THE 
VALLEY. GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS NUMBERS THROUGH THE FORECAST.


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY...MAIN FOCUS OF THE 
LONG TERM IS SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES FROM THE WEST IN THE SATURDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY TIME FRAME. SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES PERSIST 
BETWEEN THE ECMWF AND GFS MODELS...BUT BOTH SUGGEST WIDESPREAD 
PRECIP FOR THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AS SURFACE COLD FRONT 
PASSES THROUGH. AS SUCH...HAVE INCREASED POPS INTO THE LIKELY 
CATEGORY FOR SUNDAY. THERE ARE ALSO SOME DIFFERENCES IN HOW LONG 
PRECIP WILL LINGER BEHIND SYSTEM...BUT HAVE NOT MADE CHANGES TO 
PRECEDING FORECAST IN THIS REGARD DUE TO UNCERTAINTY. REMAINDER OF 
FORECAST APPEARS DRY AT THIS TIME. ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHES LATE IN 
THE LONG TERM BUT APPEARS ANY ASSOCIATED PRECIP WILL HOLD OFF UNTIL 
LATE WEEK. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE SIGNIFICANTLY FROM

GIANT SFC STREAMLINE GRADIENT ALSO WEAKENING. BUT THE LONG TROF 
BEING DRAGGED BEHIND THE ATLANTIC LOW IS AFFECTING AREA TODAY AND 
TONIGHT WITH WEAK MID-UPPER DYNAMICS. SFC TROF AFFECTS AREA THROUGH 
TONIGHT BY PROVIDING AMPLE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE INTO REGION. HENCE, 
SLOW CLEARING STILL. SORRY. AS UPPER LOW IN DIXIE MOVES NORTHEAST IT 
MAY CLIP MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT LOWLAND FOR SOME SLIGHT CHANCE TO 
LOW CHANCE POPS WITH VERY LOW QPF. BY TONIGHT POPS DROP EVEN MORE. 
ON TEMPS WENT CLOSE TO A BLEND OF MODELS. 


.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...GULF COAST LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM IS SHOWN TO BE FAR ENOUGH SE OF THE SRN APPALACHIANS BY 
THURSDAY MORNING...TO KEEP THIS PERIOD DRY AND IGNORE LOW POPS FROM 
NAM MODEL. CLOUDS SHOULD DECREASE FROM THE NORTH AND ALLOW A GOOD 
DEAL OF SUNSHINE...SO SEE POTENTIAL TO WARM TO A BLEND OF THE 
SIMILAR MOS MAX TEMPS. LITTLE TO NO CHANGES REQUIRED TO GRIDS.

SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE BUILD ACROSS THE REGION THROUGH FRIDAY...
SO WE WILL FINALLY GET REDEMPTION AND REACH AROUND SEASONAL NORMS 
FOR HIGHS AND LOWS.

MODELS IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON LONG WAVE TROUGH DEVELOPING ACROSS
THE MISSISSIPPI VALLEY REGION BY 06Z SUNDAY. HOWEVER...ECMWF HAS
SLOWED THIS SYSTEM DOWN A BIT AND IS PREFERRED. THUS...OPTED TO
KEEP POPS AT LOW CHANCE WEST TO SLIGHT CHANCE EAST ON SATURDAY
NIGHT. ECMWF CLOSES OFF THE SRN END OF THE TROUGH...SO CHOSE TO
KEEP POPS AT CHANCE FOR NOW ON SUNDAY. NO CHANGES NEEDED FOR MONDAY
OR TUESDAY...WITH POPS INTO MONDAY THEN DRY MONDAY NIGHT INTO NEW
DAY 7 (WEDNESDAY) AS UPPER RIDGE BUILDS ACROSS THE REGION.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...A PERSISTENT TROUGH OF LOW 
PRESSURE OFF THE MID-ATLANTIC COAST WILL BRING ANOTHER WEAK WAVE OF 
ENERGY ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. AN AREA OF LIGHT 
PRECIPITATION IS EVIDENT OVER WEST VIRGINIA MOVING SOUTH TOWARD 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. THE PRECIPITATION WILL BE MAINLY IN THE FORM OF 
RAIN...BUT THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS (ABOVE 3000 FEET) OF HIGH KNOB AND 
SMOKY MOUNTAINS WILL SEE SNOW. MARGINAL TEMPERATURES WILL LIMIT SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS TO 1 INCH OR LESS AT THE HIGHEST LOCATIONS.

A WEAK RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD INTO THE FORECAST AREA FOR 
TUESDAY WITH DRY CONDITIONS A WARMING TREND. ENOUGH LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE WILL KEEP SKIES MOSTLY TO PARTLY CLOUDY.

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT WITH OVERALL PATTERN FOR THE LONG TERM. EARLY IN THE 
PERIOD WE HAVE TWO UPPER TROUGHS TO DEAL WITH...ONE EJECTING OUT OF 
THE SOUTHWEST AND ONE DROPPING DOWN FROM THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES.  
THE CORE OF BOTH SHOULD PASS TO OUR SOUTH. MODELS TRY TO BRING A FEW 
HUNDREDTHS OF AN INCH OF PRECIP TO THE AREA EARLY IN THE LONG TERM 
PERIOD...BUT SINCE NOT MUCH FORCING IS EVIDENT WILL LEAN TOWARD 
DRIER SREF SOLUTION AND ONLY CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS 
WED...AND SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTHEAST ZONES WED NIGHT.  RIDGING SHOULD 
BEGIN BUILDING IN ON THURSDAY...PROVIDING DRY WEATHER INTO AT LEAST 
THE FIRST PART OF SATURDAY.  MODELS IN SOME DISAGREEMENT FOR TIMING 
OF NEXT FRONT...SO FOR NOW WILL COMPROMISE AND CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS SAT AFTERNOON...THEN CHANCE SAT NIGHT AND SUN.  WILL GO DRY 
BEHIND THIS SYSTEM ON MONDAY FOR NOW.  GFS MOS TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK 
REASONABLE...SO WILL NOT STRAY FAR.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CALLS MADE AROUND TO SW VA AND
NE TN COUNTIES IN THE EXPIRING WSW FOUND LITTLE IF ANY SNOW
CURRENTLY OR EARLIER. THE LONE EXCEPTIONS WERE A VERY LIGHT
ACCUMULATION (UNKNOWN AMOUNT) ON ROAN MTN AND HOLSTON MTN IN CARTER
COUNTY OF NE TN. RADAR RETURNS HAVE BEEN EXTREMELY WEAK OR NON-
EXISTANT IN THESE AREAS...SO SEEMED WISE TO LET THE ADVISORY EXPIRE
FOR THOSE AREAS.

EVENING SHIFT ON SUNDAY GOT A REPORT OF A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION
IN THE SMOKIES...ABOVE 3500 FEET...AND RADAR ECHOES HAVE PERSISTED
IN THE SMOKIES OVERNIGHT. THUS...I CHOSE TO EXTEND THE WSW FOR THE
SMOKIES THROUGH NOON TODAY. THE NAM MODEL SEEMED TO HAVE THESE WEAK
UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS WELL DEFINED...AND ALSO INDICATED YET ANOTHER
WEAK DISTURBANCE TO ROTATE AROUND THE BACKSIDE OF THE STAGNANT
UPPER LOW. BEST CHANCE OF LIGHT PRECIPITATION IS MAINLY SW VA/NE TN
AND THE SMOKIES TODAY AS THIS DISTURBANCE SWINGS ACROSS.

MAY BE SOME LINGERING RAIN OR SNOW SHOWERS OVER SW VA AND EXTREME
NE TN TONIGHT...UNTIL THE UPPER LOW WOBBLES A BIT FURTHER EAST.
PREVIOUS FORECAST GRIDS LOOKED VERY GOOD AND WERE ONLY SLIGHTLY
MODIFIED. 

OTHERWISE...FAVORED UNDERCUTTING THE MILDER MOS MAX TEMPS TODAY AND
WENT CLOSER TO THE NOT AS COOL GFS MINS FOR TONIGHT (DUE TO THOSE
LINGERING CLOUDS AND ONLY VERY WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION).


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...SO LITTLE CHANGES WITH 
THESE OCCLUDED LOWS. SLOWLY MOVING EAST, BUT THE WRAP AROUND 
MOISTURE AND ENERGY SPOKES KEEP COMING AND WILL DO SO UNTIL THE NEXT 
SHORT RIDGE BUILDS IN MID WEEK-ISH. BUT...THE SOUTHWEST LOW WILL 
KICK IN AFTER THAT TOWARD THE WEEKEND. BOTTOM LINE, CONTINUOUS POPS 
THROUGH MID WEEK, SHORT BREAK, THEN POPS AGAIN. TEMPS ABOUT NORMAL 
TO JUST UNDER. WE MIGHT GET SOME LIGHT SNOW IN SMOKIES TUESDAY 
NIGHT/EARLY WEDNESDAY BUT THIS WILL BE LIGHT, LOCAL, AND SHORT LIVED.

THIS LEAVES ROOM FOR THE SOUTHWESTERN LOW KICKER OVER FOUR CORNERS 
TO PROGRESS EAST TO THE GULF COAST BY ABOUT MIDWEEK WHICH IN TURNS 
CREATES A WEAKNESS IN THE FLOW. THIS WEAKNESS WILL ALL A SERIES OF

ON INCREASE THIS AFTERNOON. TEMPS WONT MOVE MUCH. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER AIR PLOTS AND SATELLITE 
PICS SHOW THE UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS 
MORNING...WITH AN ASSOCIATED SHORTWAVE TO PASS ACROSS THE REGION 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

DEEPENING MOISTURE AND WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION/LOWERING FREEZING 
LEVEL SUPPORTS A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION ABOVE 3000 TO 3500 FEET 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...MAINLY ACROSS THESE ELEVATIONS OVER SW VA...
THE NRN MTNS AND SMOKY MTNS OF EAST TN. HOWEVER...UNFAVORABLE LOW 
LVL THICKNESSES...PLUS MILD BOUNDARY LAYER AND SURFACE TEMPS DON'T 
SUPPORT THE VERY HIGH SNOW AMOUNTS FROM LOCAL WRF MODEL. SHOULD SEE 
TOO MUCH MELTING TO ACCUMULATE MORE THAN ADVISORY SNOW AMOUNTS 
(1 TO 4 INCHES FROM THIS EVENT). COORDINATION WITH GSP AND RNK FOUND 
GOOD AGREEMENT ON THIS FORECAST/ADVISORY. 

INCREASED POPS ACROSS THE BOARD TODAY...AND CARRIED LIKELY POPS IN 
THE ADVISORY AREA FOR TONIGHT. CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION WILL KEEP 
TEMPS IN CHECK...PROBABLY CLOSER TO A MOS BLEND...WITH MIXING 
HEIGHTS ALSO LOWERED A BIT. MOS MINS QUITE CLOSE AND REASONABLE FOR 
TONIGHT. 

LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE 
AREA OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST WILL CONTINUE TO BRING SHORTWAVE 
ENERGY FROM THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST MAINLY INTO THE NE HALF OF THE 
REGION WITH SCATTERED RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUING. THE SHOWERS 
WILL TAPER OFF MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING IN THE EXTREME NE 
SECTION. HIGHER ELEVATIONS COULD RECEIVE ANOTHER INCH OR SO IN 
FAVORED NW FLOW AREAS AND WENT WITH COLDER NAM TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE 
FOR HIGHS MONDAY AND LOWS MONDAY NIGHT. AS UPPER LOW SLIDES EAST 
TUESDAY THERE WILL BRING A BRIEF BREAK FROM THE PRECIPITATION UNTIL 
ANOTHER WEAK UPPER LEVEL LOW OR TROUGH SETTLES ACROSS THE TN VALLEY 
TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES WILL BE WARMER TUESDAY 
WITH SOME SUN WITH THE TREND TO CONTINUE THROUGH THURSDAY. FRIDAY 
INTO EARLY SATURDAY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN FOR A FAIR WEATHER DAY 
BEFORE ANOTHER MORE SPRING LIKE SYSTEM DEVELOPS IN THE PLAINS LATE 
FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY WITH SHOWERS SPREADING INTO TENNESSEE SATURDAY. 
AREAS TO THE WEST MAY GET THUNDERSTORMS WHICH COULD MOVE IN BY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...UPPER AIR PLOTS AND SATELLITE 
PICS SHOW THE UPPER LOW OVER THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THIS 
MORNING...WITH AN ASSOCIATED SHORTWAVE TO PASS ACROSS THE REGION 
THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING.

DEEPENING MOISTURE AND WEAK COLD AIR ADVECTION/LOWERING FREEZING 
LEVEL SUPPORTS A LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION ABOVE 3000 TO 3500 FEET 
TODAY AND TONIGHT...MAINLY ACROSS THESE ELEVATIONS OVER SW VA...
THE NRN MTNS AND SMOKY MTNS OF EAST TN. HOWEVER...UNFAVORABLE LOW 
LVL THICKNESSES...PLUS MILD BOUNDARY LAYER AND SURFACE TEMPS DON'T 
SUPPORT THE VERY HIGH SNOW AMOUNTS FROM LOCAL WRF MODEL. SHOULD SEE 
TOO MUCH MELTING TO ACCUMULATE MORE THAN ADVISORY SNOW AMOUNTS 
(1 TO 4 INCHES FROM THIS EVENT). COORDINATION WITH GSP AND RNK FOUND 
GOOD AGREEMENT ON THIS FORECAST/ADVISORY. 

INCREASED POPS ACROSS THE BOARD TODAY...AND CARRIED LIKELY POPS IN 
THE ADVISORY AREA FOR TONIGHT. CLOUDS AND PRECIPITATION WILL KEEP 
TEMPS IN CHECK...PROBABLY CLOSER TO A MOS BLEND...WITH MIXING 
HEIGHTS ALSO LOWERED A BIT. MOS MINS QUITE CLOSE AND REASONABLE FOR 
TONIGHT. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE
AREA OFF THE MID ATLANTIC COAST WILL CONTINUE TO BRING SHORTWAVE
ENERGY FROM THE NORTH AND NORTHWEST MAINLY INTO THE NE HALF OF THE
REGION WITH SCATTERED RAIN AND SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUING. THE
SHOWERS WILL TAPER OFF MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY MORNING IN THE
EXTREME NE SECTION. HIGHER ELEVATIONS COULD RECEIVE ANOTHER INCH OR
SO IN FAVORED NW FLOW AREAS AND WENT WITH COLDER NAM TEMPERATURE
GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS MONDAY AND LOWS MONDAY NIGHT. AS UPPER LOW
SLIDES EAST TUESDAY THERE WILL BRING A BRIEF BREAK FROM THE
PRECIPITATION UNTIL ANOTHER WEAK UPPER LEVEL LOW OR TROUGH SETTLES
ACROSS THE TN VALLEY TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES
WILL BE WARMER TUESDAY WITH SOME SUN WITH THE TREND TO CONTINUE
THROUGH THURSDAY. FRIDAY INTO EARLY SATURDAY HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS
IN FOR A FAIR WEATHER DAY BEFORE ANOTHER MORE SPRING LIKE SYSTEM
DEVELOPS IN THE PLAINS LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY WITH SHOWERS
SPREADING INTO TENNESSEE SATURDAY. AREAS TO THE WEST MAY GET
THUNDERSTORMS WHICH COULD MOVE IN BY SATURDAY NIGHT INTO THE

UPPER TROF HAS MOVED INTO MRX CWA THIS AFTERNOON. THIS FEATURE HAS 
PROVIDED GOOD LIFT ALLOWING SOME STORMS TO REACH THE LOW END OF 
SEVERE LIMITS. HAIL POTENTIAL WILL DIE OFF SHORTLY. FLOODING THREAT 
AND WIDESPREAD PCPN WILL CONTINUE TO GATE SWING INTO NE PARTS OF THE 
CWA THIS EVENING. N-S AREA OF SURFACE LOW PRESSURE REMAINS WEST OF

UPPER RIDGE BUILDS IN BY MIDWEEK ALLOWING FOR DRYING AND RELAXING OF 
PRESSURE GRADIENT. WITH SFC LOW STILL OVER ATLANTIC SEABOARD LATE 
SATURDAY NIGHT AND EARLY SUNDAY, AND DUE TO OCCLUDED NATURE OF UPPER 
LOW, GFS HAS "SPOKES" OR SFC TROFS ROTATING AROUND BACK SIDE OF SFC

OVER EXTRM NE MS AND NW AL MAY BE INDICATIVE OF THINGS TO COME THIS 
AFTERNOON AND EVENING. 150 KNOT PLUS UPPER LEVEL JET LOOKS TO 
PROVIDE MODERATE TO STRONG DIVERGENCE ALOFT TODAY...WITH SOME 
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING OCCURRING THIS AFTERNOON...AND LOCAL WRF MODEL 
SHOWS MUCH STRONGER LOW LEVEL JET DEVELOPING THAN NAM AND GFS 
SUGGEST. SURFACE BASED INSTABILITY IS A BIT LACKING...ALTHO HIGHER 
DEW POINT TEMPS HAVE ADVECTED NE INTO CHA THAN GUIDANCE WOULD OFFER.
AN AXIS OF ELEVATED INSTABILITY DOES ALSO MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA THIS AFTERNOON AND EVENING...WITH INCREASING LOW LEVEL STORM 
RELATIVE HELICITY. THUS...PARAMETERS MAY COME TOGETHER TO PRODUCE A 
FEW SEVERE STORMS OVER OUR FORECAST AREA...ESPECIALLY PLATEAU...SE TN
AND CENTRAL VALLEY/SMOKIES. 

ANOTHER THREAT WILL BE POTENTIAL FOR HEAVY RAINS TO PRODUCE FLOODING 
OVER SE TN AND THE MTN COUNTIES ALONG THE TN-NC STATE LINE...SO WE 
HAVE POSTED A FLOOD WATCH FOR THOSE AREAS.

PATTERN ALSO SUGGESTS POTENTIAL FOR A MTN WAVE EVENT...WITH LOCAL 
WRF MODEL 850 MB WINDS FAVORING A HIGH WIND WARNING AND WIND 
ADVISORY FOR THE FORECAST AREA LATER TODAY THROUGH THIS EVENING...
AS LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS AND TRACKS NE ALONG THE FRONTAL BOUNDARY.

OTHERWISE...ADJUSTED DEW POINT TEMPS UP SLIGHTLY TODAY FROM MOS DATA.
TRENDED TOWARD WARMER MOS HIGHS WHERE SOME DOWNSLOPING MAY 
OCCUR...BUT SHOWERS AND STORMS SHOULD ARRIVE SOON ENOUGH TO INHIBIT 
MAX TEMPS OVER SE TN AND SW NC AREAS. CHOSE A MOS BLEND FOR MINS 
TONIGHT.

SHORT-WAVE ROTATES ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND GULF COAST
STATES WEDNESDAY. LOW CONFIDENCE ON PRECIPITATION CHANCES

GUSTS AND REDUCED PCPN WITH DOWNSLOPE AFFECTS MUCH OF FRI. FLOOD 
GUIDANCE PRETTY HIGH BUT LOCALIZED FLOODING MAY OCCUR. WENT ON THE 
WARM SIDE OF MOS GUIDANCE FOR TEMPS TONIGHT AND THE COOL SIDE OF MOS 
FOR FRI.   

.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...NAM...GFS AND ECMWF 
ARE INITIALLY IN DECENT AGREEMENT WITH RESPECT TO PUSHING FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY ON THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA BY FRIDAY EVENING. WILL 
CONTINUE WITH CURRENT POPS AS PER GUIDANCE AND TIMING SAKE...AS 
BELIEVE THERE SHOULD BE DECENT AMOUNT OF RESIDUAL MOISTURE AVAILABLE 
ESPECIALLY FROM THE TRI CITIES THROUGH SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AREA. 

ALL THREE MODELS ARE SIMILAR AT THIS POINT IN INDICATING THAT
UPPER LOW SHOULD SLOWLY PROGRESS OFF THE EAST COAST OF THE U.S. BY
00Z MONDAY. THE EFFECTS OF THIS SYSTEM WILL CONTINUE TO BE
PROVIDING AT LEAST MOSTLY CLOUDY/CLOUDY CONDITIONS ACROSS THE AREA
AND WILL CONTINUE WITH CURRENT POPS FOR AREA OVER WEEKEND. MAY BE COLD
ENOUGH ALOFT FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS OVER THE HIGHER TERRAIN AT
TIMES SAT NIGHT THROUGH MON NIGHT...BUT LOOKS LIKE BULK OF PRECIP
WILL BE LIQUID. WILL CONTINUE TO HANG ON TO SLIGHT CHANCE/LOW
CHANCE POPS INTO MONDAY BEFORE WEAK UPPER RIDGING IS PROGGED TO
BUILD BACK INTO THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION BY 12Z TUESDAY.

NEXT WEAK SYSTEM PROGGED BY GFS IS A WEAK UPPER TROUGH/LOW PRESSURE
AREA THAT IS EXPECTED TO MOVE SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE OHIO VALLEY
INTO THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY. WILL ONLY INTRODUCE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS
AT THIS TIME...AS ECMWF IS NOT INDICATING AS MUCH OF A PRESENCE. 

GFS MOS TEMPS STILL LOOK GENERALLY REASONABLE...SO WILL ONLY TWEAK
TEMP FORECAST SLIGHTLY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
OVER THE DEEP SOUTH...WITH A MILD AIR MASS ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. 
LOCAL RADARS REVEAL THAT MOST OF THE CONVECTIVE ACTIVITY ASSOCIATED 
WITH THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY WAS LOCATED SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA. 
THIS FRONTAL BOUNDARY IS NOT EXPECTED TO MAKE MUCH PROGRESS TO THE

THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...WILL PLAN TO LOWER POPS EVERYWHERE FOR 
TONIGHT...WITH THE HIGHEST POPS ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST

.AVIATION...A COUPLE OF SHORTWAVE FEATURES TO BUILD ACROSS THE TAF
SITES THROUGH 24 HOURS. THE FIRST SEEMS TO BE HANDLED WELL BY THE
MODELS WITH GREATEST IMPACT EAST OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN
MOUNTAIN RANGE. IT APPEARS THAT FLIGHT WEATHER MAY BE BETTER THAN
ONE WOULD EXPECT (FOR TYS AND TRI) AS THE LOW LEVEL FLOW IS
DESCENDING OFF THE SMOKY MOUNTAIN TERRAIN LEADING TO ADIABATIC
WARMING AND ASSOCIATED DRYING AND THEREFORE LITTLE IN THE WAY OF A
LOW LEVEL BKN CEILING AT THESE SITES. AT CHA IT WILL BE A SLIGHTLY
DIFFERENT STORY AS SC HAS INVADED THIS AREA WITH DECENT MOISTURE
ADVECTION ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH. KEPT CEILINGS A LITTLE LOWER HERE
AND EVEN ADDED AN MVFR VSBY RESTRICTION FOR THURSDAY AS SECOND
SHORTWAVE MOVES ACROSS THE REGION. TRIED TO KEEP TYS AND TRI IN VFR
CATEGORY AS THE DOWNSLOPE FLOW MAY CONTINUE TO KEEP FLIGHT WEATHER
A LITTLE BETTER THAN AT CHA THROUGH THURSDAY.

308 PM EST TUE MAR 9 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...CLOUDS ARE SLOWLY INCREASING 
FROM THE WEST AS MOISTURE IS STREAMING NORTH AHEAD OF COLD FRONT 
THATS NOW MOVING INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY. AN AREA OF SHOWERS IS 
SLOWLY ADVANCING TOWARD THE PLATEAU THIS AFTERNOON. A FEW SPRINKLES 
HAVE ALREADY OCCURRED NEAR CHA. TEMPERATURES HAVE ONCE AGAIN WARMED 
INTO THE MID 60S TO LOWER 70S BY MID AFTERNOON AND WILL FALL MORE 
SLOWLY TONIGHT AS CLOUD COVER MOVES IN. RAIN CHANCES WILL INCREASE 
TONIGHT AS SHORTWAVE ENERGY MOVES UP FROM THE SOUTHWEST. FIRST 
SIGNIFICANT PRECIPITATION SINCE LAST WEEK WEDNESDAY ACROSS SOUTHERN 
AREAS AS MOISTURE FEED FROM GULF INCREASES AND LIFT INCREASES. WEAK 
FRONT DISSIPATES BUT ANOTHER FRONT REDEVELOPS ABOUT THE SAME AREA 
WEDNESDAY. LOWS TONIGHT SEVERAL DEGREES WARMER AND HIGHS TOMORROW 
MAINLY LOW TO MID 60S DUE TO CLOUDS AND RAIN.     

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MEDIUM RANGE MODELS 
ARE IN FAIRLY GOOD AGREEMENT IN CARVING OUT A CLOSED UPPER TROUGH 
OVER THE MID-SECTION OF THE NATION BY THURSDAY NIGHT AND FRIDAY. THE 
CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL SLOWLY FILL AS IT MOVES SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE 
TENNESSEE VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS FRIDAY THROUGH SUNDAY.

FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES WILL 
ROTATE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH OCCASIONAL SHOWERS 
ANTICIPATED. STRONGEST WAVE WILL MOVE THROUGH THURSDAY AFTERNOON. A 
BOUNDARY JET (850MB WINDS 40-50KTS) WILL MOVE ACROSS THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY INTO THE OHIO VALLEY THURSDAY. DOWNSLOPING SOUTHEAST WINDS OF 
30-35 KTS ARE DEPICTED BEFORE THE TROUGH PASSAGE THURSDAY WHICH MAY 
PRODUCE 40-50KT MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT ACROSS THE FOOTHILLS. A WIND 
ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND ADJACENT FOOTHILLS.

DRY SLOT WILL MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY AFTERNOON 
DIMINISHING THE CHANCES OF RAIN.

THE UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO SWING TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA FRIDAY 
WITH A COLD FRONT MOVING THROUGH THE AREA. MODELS ARE DEPICTING 
CAPES APPROACHING 1000 J/KG WITH LIFTED INDICES OF -4 TO -6 
POSSIBLE. WBZ WILL BE QUITE LOW IN THE 7500-8500FT VICINITY...SO 
LARGE HAIL MAY BE A CONCERN FOR FRIDAY AFTERNOON-EARLY EVENING.

FOR SATURDAY AND SUNDAY...UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIANS PRODUCING A CHANCE OF SHOWERS ACROSS THE VALLEY AND 
LIKELY HIGHER TERRAIN. VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE WILL BE COLD 
ENOUGH TO PRODUCE A MIXTURE OR CHANGE OVER TO SNOW SHOWERS FOR THE 
HIGHEST ELEVATIONS. 

UPPER TROUGH WILL BEGIN TO MOVE OUT MONDAY...BUT ANOTHER TROUGH MAY 
SWING IN BEHIND IT. CONFIDENCE OF THIS NEXT WAVE IS LOW.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED MEX MOS THROUGH THE EXTENDED...BUT TRENDED A 
DEGREE OR TWO LOWER ON THE MAX TEMPERATURES DUE TO THE CLOUDS AND 
PRECIPITATION.

BRINGING DRY WEATHER TONIGHT.  TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE 
FORECAST ON TRACK...NO CHANGES NEEDED.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...SKIES BECAME MOSTLY SUNNY IN 
THE WAKE OF THE WEAK DISTURBANCE THAT BRUSHED THROUGH THE NE HALF OF 
THE AREA THIS MORNING WITH JUST A FEW SPRINKLES OR SHOWERS AND 
POSSIBLY A BIT OF SNOW IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. TEMPERATURES SOARED 
TO THE MID 50S TO NEAR 60 IN SW VA AND NE TN TO THE MID 60S TO LOWER 
70S CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN SECTIONS...A FEW DEGREES MORE THAN 
EXPECTED. DRIER AIR MIXED DOWN WITH LOW HUMIDITIES AT LOCATIONS 
ACROSS THE REGION ESPECIALLY SOUTH. NEXT SYSTEM TAKING SHAPE OVER 
THE CENTRAL ROCKIES THIS AFTERNOON THAT DEEPENS TONIGHT AND MOVES 
INTO THE SOUTHERN PLAINS TUESDAY. GFS MUCH FASTER WITH MOISTURE 
INCREASE THEN NAM WHICH BRINGS SHOWERS INTO WESTERN SECTIONS TUESDAY 
MORNING WHILE NAM HOLDS OFF UNTIL TUESDAY NIGHT. WILL BRING POPS IN 
VERY GRADUALLY TUESDAY NOT REACHING NE TN UNTIL AFTER 00Z. AM A 
LITTLE AFRAID HIGHS MIGHT BE CLOSER TO NAM GUIDANCE BUT INCREASED 
CLOUD COVER SHOULD KEEP TEMPS A LITTLE COOLER. LOWS A FEW DEGREES 
WARMER MOST PLACES AS RIDGING ALOFT MOVES OVERHEAD. LOWER VALLEYS 
WHERE ATMOSPHERE DECOUPLES STILL SHOULD DROP INTO THE MID TO UPPER 
30S.       

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...WEATHER STORY FOR THE
EXTENDED IS A DEVELOPING DEEP UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE OHIO AND
TENNESSEE VALLEYS BY LATE WEEK- WEEKEND. A SERIES OF SHORT-WAVES
WILL MOVE OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS THROUGH THE WEEK. FIRST WAVE
WILL AFFECT THE AREA LATE TUESDAY AND NIGHT WITH GOOD DIVERGENCE
ALOFT AND SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT. AIRMASS WILL BE INITIALLY DRY.
ANOTHER WAVE FOR WEDNESDAY...BUT MOST OF THE ENERGY WILL REMAIN
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA.
ALSO...DOWNSLOPING WINDS INTO THE NORTHERN AND CENTRAL SECTIONS
WILL KEEP CHANCES DOWN. FAIRLY STRONG SHORT-WAVE WILL MOVE ACROSS
THE TENNESSEE VALLEY THURSDAY PRODUCING LIKELY POPS...BUT AGAIN
DOWNSLOPING WINDS MAY LIMIT QPF FOR THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN
SECTIONS.

A DRY SLOT ALSO MOVES ACROSS THURSDAY WITH PRECIPITATION ENDING FROM 
SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST. THURSDAY NIGHT WILL BE MAINLY DRY.

FOR FRIDAY...SEVERE THUNDERSTORMS WILL BE POSSIBLE. A COLD FRONT 
WILL MOVE ACROSS THE AREA FRIDAY AFTERNOON WITH AN UPPER TROUGH AND 
ASSOCIATED COLD AIR ALOFT SETTING THE STAGE FOR CONVECTION. 
DEPENDING ON HOW MUCH INSOLATION OCCURS BEFORE FRONTAL PASSAGE AND 
TIMING OF FRONT...AIRMASS MAY BE UNSTABLE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE SEVERE 
STORMS WITH THE MAIN THREAT BEING LARGE HAIL AND DAMAGING WINDS.

FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY...UPPER TROUGH REMAINS ACROSS THE OHIO-
TENNESSEE VALLEYS AND SLOWLY FILLING. WRAP-AROUND MOISTURE...AFTERNOON
INSTABILITY DUE TO COLD AIR ALOFT...AND UPSLOPE FLOW WILL CONTINUE
CHANCES OF SHOWERS...ESPECIALLY FOR THE HIGHER TERRAIN. VERTICAL

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...WEAKENING SHORT WAVE WILL EXIT 
NORTHERN AREAS THIS MORNING.  MAY BE A FEW SPRINKLES OR LIGHT 
SHOWERS EARLY OVER FAR NORTH...AND GIVEN LACK OF OBS UPSTREAM WITH 
MEASURABLE PRECIP WILL JUST MENTION SPRINKLES.  OTHERWISE...CLOUDS 
SHOULD DECREASE DURING THE DAY...AND SHOULD BE DRY THROUGH TONIGHT.  
MAV TEMPS CONTINUE TO BE PRETTY GOOD OF LATE...AND LOOK REASONABLE 
ONCE AGAIN...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...THE ATMOSPHERE WILL TRANSITION 
FROM THE WEEKEND FAIR WEATHER PATTERN TO A MORE UNSETTLED AND 
PERHAPS MORE SPRINGLIKE PATTERN AS THE WESTERN STATES UPPER LEVEL 
TROUGH SHIFTS STEADILY EAST INTO THE CENTER OF THE NATION WHILE 
CLOSING OFF ON TUESDAY. KIND OF LIKED THE NAM DEPICTION WITH 
EXPECTED WEATHER ON TUESDAY WITH A POP THAT DOESN'T GET TOO FAR OUT 
OF HAND AND DISPLAYS A GRADIENT OF HIGHER TO LOWER PROBABILITY FROM 
SOUTHWEST THROUGH NORTHEAST. FORECAST STILL UNCERTAIN TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH DAYTIME PERIOD WEDNESDAY AS SURFACE WARM FRONT ADVANCES 
NORTH OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION AND SUPPORTING UPPER LOW 
SHIFTS WELL NORTH INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS. MODELS INDICATE 
POSSIBILITY OF THE PASSAGE OF SOME WEAK SHORT WAVE ENERGY DURING 
THIS PERIOD WITH CONTINUATION OF MOISTURE ADVECTION OFF THE GULF SO 
STAYED IN MEDIUM CHANCE CATEGORY AS THE REGION AWAITS INFLUENCE OF 
STRONGER UPPER LEVEL TROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY. THIS 
PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL ALSO DEEPEN THROUGH TIME AND WILL CLOSE OFF 
WHILE MAKING LIMITED PROGRESS THROUGH THE MIDWEST THURSDAY INTO 
FRIDAY. THIS FEATURE SUPPORT A SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM WHICH WILL 
DRIVE EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA DURING THE DAY THURSDAY 
GENERATING A DECENT AREA OF CONVECTION. THUS CONTINUED TO ADVERTISE 
LIKELY POPS WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY FOR THIS SYSTEM. 
VERTICALLY STACKED LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL PRODUCE YET ANOTHER COLD 
FRONT ON FRIDAY AND AS UPPER CENTER DRAWS CLOSER TO THE MID SOUTH 
INSTABILITY WILL INCREASE DURING THE DAY FRIDAY FOR THE POSSIBILITY 
OF MORE CONVECTION. UPPER LOW TRUDGES SLOWLY EAST ACROSS THE OHIO 
VALLEY AND CENTRAL APPALACHIANS OVER THE WEEKEND SO HAD TO MAINTAIN 
A CHANCE FOR SHOWERS THROUGH THIS PERIOD AS NORTHWEST FLOW BRINGS 
COLDER AIR BACK INTO THE REGION. ADJUSTED MAX/MIN TEMPERATURES 
CLOSER TO MILDER NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE WHICH SEEMS REASONABLE WITH 
SUCH A LENGTHY PERIOD OF SOUTHERLY FLOW THROUGH DAY FIVE.

928 PM EST SUN MAR 7 2010

.DISCUSSION...OBSERVATIONS UPSTREAM INDICTING LIGHT RAIN 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SHORTWAVE.  CURRENT POPS LOOK GOOD WITH THE 
BULK OF THE RAIN IN THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA.  TEMPERATURES 
AND THE REMAINDER OF THE FORECAST ALSO APPEARS ON TRACK.  WILL 
UPDATE FORECAST TO REMOVE EVENING/MIDNIGHT WORDING.  NO OTHER 
CHANGES PLANNED. 

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND MONDAY)...HIGH CLOUDS HAVE THINNED ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON...ALLOWING TEMPS TO REACH WITHIN A 
FEW DEGREES OF SEASONAL NORMS ALREADY. UPSTREAM SHORTWAVE WAS 
LOCATED ACROSS NRN ILLINOIS AND NOT AS TIGHTLY WOUND UP AS EARLIER 
TODAY. AIRMASS IS QUITE DRY PRESENTLY...BUT MODELS ARE PERSISTENT IN 
DEVELOPING SOME LIGHT QPF ACROSS SW VA AND EXTREME NRN PARTS OF E TN 
OVERNIGHT. WILL MAINTAIN CONSISTENCY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND KEEP A 
LOW POP OR SPRINKLES ACROSS THOSE AREAS. INCREASING CLOUDS WILL 
FAVOR MILDER MINS TONIGHT.

SOME LINGERING SPRINKLES OR PATCHY LIGHT SHOWERS MONDAY MORNING...
THEN A DECREASE IN CLOUDINESS. CHOSE THE GFS MOS IN GENERAL FOR 
MONDAY HIGHS...ALTHO GUIDANCE WAS QUITE CLOSE AND REASONABLE. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...SHORT RANGE MODEL 
ENSEMBLES SHOW A PATTERN CHANGE AS UPPER RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA MONDAY NIGHT SHIFTS EAST. LOW PRESSURE OVER THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS AND UPPER LOW MOVES SLOWLY NORTHEAST MONDAY NIGHT 
AND TUESDAY TOWARD THE MID MS VALLEY. CLOUDS WILL INCREASE WITH A 
CHANCE OF SHOWERS AS A WEAK WARM FRONT PASSES THROUGH. TUESDAY NIGHT 
AND WEDNESDAY THE SYSTEM WILL WOBBLE AROUND WITH CONSIDERABLE CLOUD 
COVER BUT NOT MUCH PRECIPITATION AS MAIN SYSTEM STAYS FAR TO THE 
WEST. BEST CHANCE OF SHOWERS THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY AS WARM AIR 
ADVECTION AND COLD FRONT PASS THROUGH EASTERN TENNESSEE VALLEY. 
THUNDERSTORMS LOOK POSSIBLE THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. UPPER LOW WOBBLES 
EAST THROUGH OHIO VALLEY AS SURFACE LOW MOVES BY NORTH OF TN. COULD 
BE FIRST THREAT FOR SEVERE WEATHER THURSDAY AND FRIDAY TOO. LARGE 
UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM WILL STAY NEAR FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND 
WITH THREAT FOR SHOWERS CONTINUING. TEMPERATURES MILD THROUGH 
FRIDAY THEN COOLING A FEW DEGREES ON THE WEEKEND.

.DISCUSSION...NICE DAY AHEAD...ALTHOUGH A FAIR AMOUNT OF HIGH CLOUDS 
ARE FILTERING OUT SOME OF THE SUNSHINE. THESE HIGH CLOUDS ARE 
ASSOCIATED WITH THE SRN STREAM UPPER LEVEL JET. 12Z OHX AND RNK 
SOUNDINGS SUPPORT HIGHS IN THE UPPER 40S TO LOWER 60S...GENERALLY IN 
LINE WITH THE CURRENT FORECAST. THUS...ONLY ITEM OF CONCERN IS 
MOSTLY SUNNY OR PARTLY SUNNY THIS AFTERNOON.

OTHERWISE...A SHORTWAVE OVER SE IOWA IS WELL DEFINED ON SATELLITE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A WEAKENING SHORT WAVE WILL DIVE 
SOUTHEAST...BRUSHING NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA TONIGHT.  WE WILL 
SEE AN INCREASE IN CLOUDS DURING THE SHORT TERM...WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SOME LIGHT RAIN OR SPRINKLES FAR NORTH LATE TONIGHT.  
WILL CARRY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR MUCH OF OUR SW VA ZONES TONIGHT.  
LOOKS LIKE TEMPS WILL BE CLOSE TO FREEZING IN SW VA AND A FEW 
POCKETS OF VERY LIGHT FREEZING RAIN CANNOT BE COMPLETELY RULED 
OUT...BUT FOR NOW WILL KEEP TEMPS JUST ABOVE FREEZING AND ONLY 
MENTION RAIN SHOWERS.   MAV TEMPS HAVE BEEN PERFORMING FAIRLY 
WELL...AND LOOK REASONABLE ONCE AGAIN...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...THE FAIR WEATHER PATTERN 
GRADUALLY BREAKS DOWN LEADING TO AN UNSETTLED MID TO LATE WEEK 
PERIOD. MONDAY SHOULD BE DRY FOR MOST OF THE AREA...BUT THERE WILL 
BE A FEW MORE CLOUDS AROUND AS A WEAK UPPER LEVEL TROUGH SHIFTS 
SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS. KEPT THE SLIGHT CHANCE 
POP FOR A SHOWER ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA MONDAY MORNING. THE NEXT 
SYSTEM THAT WILL IMPACT THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE AN UPPER LEVEL LOW 
(CURRENTLY BUILDING EAST TOWARD SOUTHERN CALIFORNIA) THAT JOURNEYS 
NORTHEAST INTO THE CENTRAL PLAINS ON TUESDAY. THIS PRESSURE SYSTEM 
WILL LEAD TO AN INCREASE IN TEMPERATURE AND MOISTURE ADVECTION 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. DURING THE DAY AND A FEW SHOWERS MAY 
DEVELOP ALONG A WARM FRONT MAKING ITS WAY NORTH. GENERALLY KEPT POPS 
IN LOW TO SLIGHT CHANCE RANGE FOR THIS POSSIBILITY ON TUESDAY. TRIED 
TO KEEP PROBABILITY OF PRECIP FOR A SHOWER IN A LOW TO MEDIUM RANGE 
FOR TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY AS STILL BELIEVE THE FORECAST AREA 
MAY NOT SEE ANY SIGNIFICANT LIFTING MECHANISM UNTIL WEDNESDAY NIGHT 
INTO THURSDAY AS TRAILING SHORT WAVE/UPPER LOW DRIVES EAST ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS INTO THE MIDWEST WITH ASSOCIATED SURFACE LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM LIFTING NORTHEAST THROUGH THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY 
INTO THE MID SOUTH DURING THE DAY THURSDAY. MODELS INDICATE SOME 
INSTABILITY PRESENT AHEAD OF SYSTEM COLD FRONT AND KEPT POSSIBILITY 
OF CONVECTION GOING WITH LIKELY POPS. KEPT CHANCE POPS FOR SHOWERS 
ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY AS MODELS SLOW THE PROGRESSION OF LONG WAVE 
UPPER LOW ACROSS THE EASTERN U.S. QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY 
CONCERNING THE  DETAILS OF TIMING EPISODES OF PRECIP DURING THE LONG 
TERM FORECAST SO JUST TRIED TO KEEP TREND OF INCREASING CHANCE FOR 
RAIN INTO THE LATTER PORTION OF THE WORK WEEK WITH SOME TAPERING BY 
WEEKS END. THE GOOD NEWS IS WITH UPPER TROUGHING HANGING AROUND WEST 
OF THE FORECAST AREA TEMPERATURES WILL GENERALLY BE MILDER THAN 
WE'VE SEEN IN RECENT WEEKS.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...RIDGING HOLDS ON FOR ANOTHER 
GREAT DAY ON SUNDAY WITH SKIES FILLED WITH SUNSHINE AND HIGH

SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS LATE SUNDAY NIGHT/EARLY MONDAY AND STAYED WITH 
JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR A SHOWER ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. MONDAY 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE A FAIRLY DECENT DAY ALTHOUGH NOT QUITE AS 
SUNNY WITH A FEW CLOUDS PRESSING IN WITH THE WEAK SHORT WAVE TROF. 
BY TUESDAY...CENTRAL PLAINS UPPER TROF/CLOSED LOW WILL MIGRATE 
STEADILY NORTHEAST TOWARD THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES WHILE SURFACE LOW

TUESDAY NIGHT AS WARM FRONT SHIFTS NORTH TOWARD THE OHIO VALLEY.

TROF SWINGS FURTHER NORTH INTO THE NORTHERN PLAINS AND WESTERN GREAT 
LAKES WHILE THE FORECAST AREA AWAITS TRAILING UPPER LEVEL SYSTEM 
WHICH DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE NORTHERN ROCKIES. TRIED TO MAINTAIN 
JUST A SMALL POP FOR DAYTIME PERIOD WEDNESDAY AS THERE COULD END UP 
BEING A BREAK IN THE ACTION AS THE REGION WILL BE BETWEEN SYSTEMS. 
GRADUALLY RAISE POPS WEDNESDAY NIGHT INTO THURSDAY AS DEEPENING 
UPPER LEVEL TROF OR CLOSED LOW BUILD INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY. APPLIED CHANCE FOR CONVECTION ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO THIRDS 
OF THE FORECAST THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT AS INSTABILITY INCREASES 
WITH APPROACH OF UPPER LOW. MODEL SOLUTIONS DIVERGE WITH GFS 
ACCELERATING THE LOW FASTER TOWARD THE ATLANTIC COAST ON FRIDAY

AS THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OFF THE COAST MOVES FARTHER EAST...THE 
AMPLIFIED RIDGE OVER THE MS VALLEY WILL TRACK EAST TONIGHT AND 
TOMORROW. THIS WILL KEEP SKIES CLEAR THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. WE 
SHOULD SEE GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING CONDITIONS TONIGHT AS WINDS DROP 
OFF TO NEAR CALM AFTER SUNSET. WENT WITH THE COOLER GFS MOS TEMPS 
FOR LOWS TONIGHT. THE SURFACE RIDGE WILL SETTLE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY 
TOMORROW. TEMPERATURE ADVECTION WILL BE NEAR NEUTRAL BUT WITH FULL 
SUN WE SHOULD REACH THE UPPER 50S SOUTH TO UPPER 40S NORTH.

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...THERE SHOULD STILL
BE GOOD RADIATIONAL COOLING SATURDAY NIGHT AND VIRTUALLY NO CLOUDS.
EVEN WITH WARMING AN EVEN DRIER AIRMASS SATURDAY NIGHT WILL ALLOW
LOWS TO DROP INTO THE MID AND UPPER 20S WITH LOWS BELOW 20 IN THE
HIGHER NORTHEAST VALUES LIKE AT TRI. SUNDAY WARMING CONTINUES WITH
SOME MOISTURE RETURN BUT STILL A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY. HIGHS NEAR
NORMAL MID 50S TO LOWER 60S. AN UPPER LOW NOW OVER THE NORTHERN
ROCKIES WILL WEAKEN SUNDAY AND SUNDAY NIGHT AS IT PASSES OVER RIDGE
OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL STATES. A FEW SHOWERS MAY SPREAD INTO SW
VIRGINIA BUT THE MAIN AFFECT WILL BE INCREASING CLOUDS. PATTERN
CHANGES MORE MONDAY AND TUESDAY AS RIDGING ALOFT SLOWLY SHIFTS EAST
INTO THE ATLANTIC. MILD TEMPERATURES WILL CONTINUE WITH NIGHT TIME
TEMPERATURES ABOVE FREEZING FOR THE MOST PART SUNDAY NIGHT.
DEVELOPING SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS MONDAY AND MONDAY NIGHT
WILL INCREASE MOISTURE AND LIFT INTO THE FORECAST AREA TUESDAY.
EXPECT SHOWERY CONDITIONS TUESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY BUT BEST CHANCES
HOLD OFF AS SYSTEM SLOWLY MOVES ACROSS REGION THURSDAY AND FRIDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE TO BUILD 
INTO THE AREA DURING THE PERIOD.  WILL BE A FEW CLOUDS AROUND AT 
TIMES...ESPECIALLY NORTH...BUT STILL SHOULD BE PLENTY OF SUNSHINE 
TODAY WITH A CLEAR TO MOSTLY CLEAR SKY TONIGHT.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY 
LOOK REASONABLE...SO WILL STAY CLOSE.  

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...RIDGING AT THE SURFACE AND 
ALOFT WILL KEEP THE FAIR WEATHER REGIME GOING OVER THE WEEKEND. THE 
MODELS INDICATE A WEAK SHORT WAVE TROF DROPS SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE 
OHIO VALLEY ACROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS LATE SUNDAY NIGHT INTO 
MONDAY. STAYED THE COURSE FOR NOW AND KEPT POPS OUT OF THE FORECAST 
FOR THIS RATHER INSIGNIFICANT FEATURE AWAITING STRONGER MID TO LATE 
WEEK SYSTEM WHICH THE MODELS HAVE SLOWED DOWN A BIT. BECAUSE OF 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER TREND...ADJUSTED POPS BACK A LITTLE IN TIMING AND 
MAGNITUDE BUT STILL HAVE SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POP GOING FOR RAIN 
SHOWERS MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY NIGHT AS INITIAL SHORT WAVE BUILDS 
NORTHEAST INTO THE MID MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. WAA/ISENTROPIC LIFT MAY 
LEAD TO THE DEVELOPMENT OF A FEW SHOWERS DURING THIS PERIOD BEFORE 
TAPERING BACK DURING THE DAY WEDNESDAY AS THIS FIRST SYSTEM ROTATES 
NORTH TOWARD THE WESTERN GREAT LAKES. NEXT SHORT WAVE DRIVES EAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND INTO THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AND IS DEPICTED TO SLOW DOWN AND CLOSE 
OFF INTO AN UPPER LOW SOMEWHERE OVER THE MID SOUTH. STAYED WITH 
CHANCE POPS DURING THIS PERIOD WITH THE HIGHEST PROBABILITY USED ON 
THURSDAY DUE TO THE CLOSE PROXIMITY OF THE STACKED PRESSURE SYSTEM. 
CONCERNING TEMPERATURES STAYED A FEW DEGREES UNDER SUGGESTED MEX MOS 
GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...A SHORTWAVE TRACKING THROUGH THE 
AREA BRINGING LIGHT SNOW AND FLURRIES TO THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF 
THE CWA THIS MORNING.  ADDITIONAL SNOW ACROSS THE ADVISORY AREAS 
SHOULD BE LIMITED AS A DRIER AIRMASS PUSHES INTO THE REGION 
TODAY...SO WILL LEAVE THE CURRENT WSW AS IS. THE HIGHEST CHANCE POPS 
FOR TODAY WILL BE IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT CHANCES WILL DECREASE 
BY THE AFTERNOON HOURS. CLOUDS SHOULD BE DECREASING TODAY WHICH WILL 
HELP TEMPERATURES TO BE A BIT WARMER THAN YESTERDAY...BUT WE STILL BE 
BELOW NORMAL FOR THIS TIME OF YEAR.  STAYED NEAR THE MET/MAV BLEND 
TEMPERATURES FOR TODAY.  HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN TONIGHT BRINGING 
DRY WEATHER AND BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. STAYED NEAR THE MET/MAV 
BLEND TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT AS WELL.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...MODELS REMAIN IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT WITH THE LARGE-SCALE PATTERN THROUGH THE WEEKEND...AND 
THEN DIVERGE WITH THEIR HANDLING OF THE NEXT SYSTEM FOR EARLY NEXT 
WEEK. A BROAD UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL BE EXITING THE EASTERN HALF OF 
THE NATION ON FRIDAY...WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE BUILDING OVER THE 
PLAINS. A SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE AREA WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE 
MIGRATING OVER THE REGION BY SATURDAY AS WELL. THIS SCENARIO WILL 
FINALLY BRING A NICE WARMING TREND BACK TO NORMAL LEVELS FOR THIS 
TIME OF YEAR. LATEST MODEL RUNS CONTINUE TO INDICATE THAT A FRONTAL 
BOUNDARY WILL APPROACH THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY ON MONDAY...BUT WILL 
LIKELY NOT AFFECT THE FORECAST AREA...SO HAVE REMOVED THE MENTION OF 
SHOWERS FOR MONDAY. GFS AND ECMWF MODELS HAVE NOT BEEN IN AGREEMENT 
WITH ANY SOLUTION FOR EARLY NEXT WEEK...BUT THEY STILL BOTH AGREE 
THAT A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL AFFECT THE TN RIVER VALLEY AROUND 
THE TUESDAY TIMEFRAME. THE GFS MODEL SHOWS THIS SYSTEM QUICKLY 
MOVING OUT OF THE REGION ON WEDNESDAY...WHILE THE ECMWF MODEL KEEPS 
THINGS UNSETTLED WITH ANOTHER STRONG UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH DEVELOPING 
ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS ON WEDNESDAY. 
SINCE THE ECMWF MODEL HAS BEEN MORE CONSISTENT LATELY IN THE 
EXTENDED THAN THE GFS MODEL...WILL MENTION A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR 
SHOWERS ON WEDNESDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...WILL TREND TOWARDS THE GFS 
NUMBERS THROUGH THE EXTENDED PERIOD...WHICH ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
WITH THE ENSEMBLE MEANS.

CALLS FROM WISE COUNTY INDICATED THAT 1 TO 2 INCHES OF SNOW HAS 
ALREADY ACCUMULATED...SO HAVE INCLUDED THEM IN THE WINTER WX

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OFF THE COAST OF THE FLORIDA PANHANDLE...WITH AN 
INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING NORTHEAST OF IT ALONG THE EASTERN

IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS BELOW 2000 FEET. IN ADDITION...IT APPEARS 
THAT TEMPS IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS WILL EITHER REMAIN OR RISE ABOVE

ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN...SOUTHWEST NC AND THE MOUNTAINS...BUT MAINLY 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2000 FEET. THUS...WILL CONTINUE 
THE ADVISORIES AS PREVIOUSLY ADVERTISED. FOR THE REST OF THE

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...AN UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE
SYSTEM CURRENTLY OVER EASTERN TEXAS WILL BUILD ACROSS THE DEEP
SOUTH LATER TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY. MODEL SOLUTIONS ASSOCIATED
WITH THIS SYSTEM'S TREK NOT ENTIRELY ON THE SAME PAGE WITH THE GFS
A LITTLE STRONGER AND FASTER THAN THE WRF AND ECMWF. MODEL
SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT TEMPERATURES WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW
ACCUMULATION ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. HOWEVER...THE
PROFILE WILL SUPPORT A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW ACROSS MUCH OF THE
AREA. UPPER LEVEL DYNAMICS AND DEPTH OF MOISTURE WILL BE BETTER
SUITED TO SOME SNOWFALL ACCUMULATION ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE AND
SOUTHWEST NORTH CAROLINA AS WELL AS THE HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE
TENNESSEE AND NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. THEREFORE...A WINTER WEATHER
ADVISORY WAS ISSUED FOR THESE AREAS. THE GREATEST SNOWFALL
ACCUMULATION...AS IS USUALLY THE CASE...WILL BE IN THE SMOKY
MOUNTAINS WHERE SNOWFALL MAY REACH 4 INCHES. LESSER AMOUNTS WILL
OCCUR ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WHERE RAIN SHOULD BE MIXED WITH
THE SNOW AT TIMES MAINLY DURING THE AFTERNOON AS LOW LEVEL
TEMPERATURES RISE A FEW DEGREES ABOVE FREEZING. INCLUDED SOUTHEAST
TENNESSEE IN THE ADVISORY BECAUSE OF THE BETTER LIFT AND MOISTURE
EXPECTED IN THIS AREA AS WELL AS EVENT ONSET WHICH WILL BE VERY
CLOSE TO THE MORNING RUSH HOUR. SLICK SPOTS MAY DEVELOP ON BRIDGES
AND OVERPASSES DURING THIS CRITICAL PART OF THE DAY. UNDERCUT MAX
TEMP GUIDANCE BY A FEW DEGREES ON TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM LINGERING OFF THE NEW ENGLAND 
COAST...WITH ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER TEXAS. THE 
NORTHEAST LOW IS PROGGED TO FINALLY MOVE EAST OUT OVER THE ATLANTIC 
OCEAN TODAY...WITH THE UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMING MORE ZONAL OVER THE 
FORECAST AREA. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF LOW 
CLOUDS LINGERING OVER THE APPALACHIAN REGION...WITH HIGH CLOUDS IN 
ADVANCE OF THE TEXAS LOW SPREADING NORTHEAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT A STRONG MID LEVEL INVERSION 
WILL LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...SO WILL BE PESSIMISTIC 
WITH SKY CONDITIONS DUE TO THE LIMITED VERTICAL MIXING EXPECTED. 
WITH CLOUDS IN ADVANCE OF THE TEXAS LOW MOVING OVER THE REGION... 
THINK THAT IT WILL REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY THROUGH AT LEAST TUESDAY 
NIGHT. THIS SOUTHERN-STREAM LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE 
EAST ALONG THE GULF COAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND THEN INTO THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC ON TUESDAY. SHORT-RANGE MODELS ARE IN GOOD 
AGREEMENT THAT MOST ITS ASSOCIATED MOISTURE WILL REMAIN SOUTH AND 
EAST OF THE FORECAST AREA...BUT THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF ITS PRECIP IS 
EXPECTED TO AFFECT MOSTLY SOUTHEAST TN...SOUTHWEST NC AND THE 
MOUNTAINS. IN ADDITION...TEMPS ARE PROGGED TO RISE INTO THE 40S ON 
TUESDAY ACROSS MOST OF THE LOWER ELEVATIONS...SO THINK THERE WILL BE 
A CHANGEOVER TO RAIN BY THE AFTERNOON IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS BELOW 
2500 FEET. OVERALL...IT APPEARS THAT LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN...SOUTHWEST NC AND THE 
MOUNTAINS...BUT MAINLY ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET. 
WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT TO ADDRESS THIS 
POTENTIAL LIGHT SNOWFALL EVENT ON TUESDAY. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH MINS THROUGH THE PERIOD...BUT 
REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES WITH MAXES. WILL PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE 
COOLER NAM NUMBERS WHICH HAVE VERIFIED BETTER LATELY.

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...SOUTHEAST LOW MOVES UP THE 
COAST WITH US IN WEAK WRAP-AROUND RH ON WEDNESDAY INTO WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. TEMPS IN THE COLUMN REMAIN BELOW FREEZING EXCEPT PERHAPS AT 
THE SFC ITSELF, AND SO WHAT LITTLE POPS THERE ARE WILL BE SNOW, EVEN 
AT RELATIVELY WARM TEMPS. TEMPS REMAIN A BIT COOL THROUGH THE END OF 
THE WEEK WITH A CONTINUED CLEARING AND DRYING TREND. BY THE WEEKEND 
WITH A RIDGE BUILDING IN, A RETURN TO MORE NORMAL (EVEN ABOVE 
NORMAL) TEMPS LOOKS LIKELY, ALTHOUGH CLOUDS WILL ALSO ADVANCE IN 
FROM NEXT SYSTEM OVER THE HORIZON. STILL, SHOULD THIS ACTUALLY 
HAPPEN, IT WILL SEEM LIKE A HEAT WAVE. SPRING MAY HAPPEN EVENTUALLY, 
AFTER ALL. CROSS YOUR FINGERS.

NC AND A SLIGHT EROSION ON THE WESTERN FRINGES ACROSS MIDDLE TN. 
CLOUDS MAY CONTINUE TO DECREASE OVER EXTREME SE TN AND SW NC THIS 
EVENING...BUT STAY MOSTLY CLOUDY ELSEWHERE OVERNIGHT. THE CLOUD 
COVER LAST NIGHT WREAKED HAVOC WITH MIN TEMP FORECAST...WITH MAV MOS 
AS MUCH AS 10 DEGREES TOO COLD AT CHA. MADE A SLIGHT ADJUSTMENT FOR 
THESE CLOUDS TONIGHT. 

NOT A LOT OF PRECIPITATION INDICATED ON AREA RADARS...BUT SMOKY MTN 
NATL PARK DID REPORT FLURRIES EARLIER WITH NOT MUCH ON RADAR...THUS 
OPTED TO CARRY A MENTION OF FLURRIES INTO THE EVENING FOR THE SMOKY 
MTNS AND NRN MTNS INTO WSHINGTON AND RUSSELL COUNTIES OF VA.

LOW CLOUDS SHOULD LIFT AND GRADUALLY DISSIPATE MONDAY...BUT JUST IN 
TIME FOR SOME MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TO ARRIVE AHEAD OF THE LOWER 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY SYSTEM. THESE CLOUDS SHOULD INHIBIT REACHING THE 
WARMER MOS HIGHS (WHICH ARE STILL WELL BELOW CLIMO NORMS) ON MONDAY.


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...NEXT SYSTEM POISED TO 
BRUSH AREA ON TUESDAY AS THE HEART OF IT PASSES TO OUR SOUTH AND 
THEN TO OUR EAST.  STILL FORECASTING SOME PRECIP FOR PARTS OF THE 
AREA WITH IT LOOKING LIKE MOST OF THE PRECIP WILL BE SNOW. ONLY 
GOING WITH ABOUT AN INCH ALONG THE SOUTHERN TIER WITH AN INCH OR
TWO IN THE SE CORNER OF THE AREA...THEN TAPERING TO LESS THAN AN
INCH QUICKLY FARTHER NORTH. AFTER THAT...STILL KEEPING SOME LIGHT
SNOW SHOWERS AND FLURRIES FOR NORTHERN SECTIONS THROUGH WEDNESDAY
NIGHT DUE TO UPSLOPE AND SLIGHT INSTABILITY. TAKING OUT POPS ON
THURSDAY NOW...AS SYSTEM LOOKS LIKE IT WILL BE TOO FAR TO THE
NORTH.

AS THIS TROUGH FINALLY EXITS...IT LOOKS TO BE MUCH WARMER STARTING 
ON FRIDAY AND INTO THE WEEKEND.  A WEAK SYSTEM MAY BE APPROACHING BY 
THEN SUNDAY...BUT NOT INSERTING ANY POPS...JUST PUMPING UP THE SKY 
COVER IN THOSE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM LINGERING OVER THE NORTHEAST...WITH A LEE 
TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE 
APPALACHIANS. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO REMAIN QUASI- 
STATIONARY OFF THE NORTHEAST COAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH ANOTHER 
UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE ROTATING AROUND ITS PARENT UPPER LOW THIS 
MORNING. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS AN EXTENSIVE AREA OF CLOUDINESS 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT RADAR IMAGERY AND SURFACE OBS OVER 
EASTERN KY AND SOUTHWEST VA INDICATE THAT THE PRECIP ASSOCIATED WITH 
THIS SHORT WAVE IS VERY LIGHT. MODEL SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT MOST OF 
THE MOISTURE TODAY OVER THE FORECAST AREA WILL BE SHALLOW AND MOSTLY 
LOCATED BELOW 850 MB AND BENEATH A STRONG MID LEVEL INVERSION. WITH 
THE PRECIP INITIATION REGION REMAINING LOCATED BETWEEN -5 AND -10 
CELSIUS...THINK THAT SUPERCOOLED WATER INSTEAD OF SNOW WILL BE 
POSSIBLE THIS MORNING. A PHONE CALL TO WISE COUNTY DISPATCH CONFIRMS 
THAT SOME BLACK ICE HAS BEEN REPORTED THIS MORNING...WITH SOME 
FREEZING DRIZZLE ALREADY OBSERVED IN A FEW AREAS IN EASTERN KY. 
THUS...WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE WINTER WX ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWEST VA 
AND THE MOUNTAINS THIS MORNING...AND WILL ALSO MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF SOME LIGHT FREEZING RAIN AND SOME LIGHT ICE ACCUMS. 
WITH PRECIP EXPECTED TO REMAIN MORE STRATIFORM THAN CONVECTIVE 
TODAY...DO NOT EXPECT MUCH UPSLOPE ENHANCEMENT TO THE PRECIP ACROSS 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS A RESULT...FEEL THAT ONLY AN INCH OR TWO 
OF SNOW ACCUMS WILL BE POSSIBLE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...BUT 
THIS MAY BE OPTIMISTIC IF FREEZING DRIZZLE LINGERS INSTEAD. THE MID 
LEVEL INVERSION OVER THE FORECAST AREA SHOULD KEEP CLOUDS FROM 
DIMINISHING TOO MUCH TODAY OR TONIGHT...SO WILL PLAN TO BE 
PESSIMISTIC WITH SKY CONDITIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND WILL 
PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE WARMER GFS NUMBERS ACROSS THE SOUTHERN 
HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA AND THE COOLER NAM NUMBERS ACROSS THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MAIN FOCUS FOR THE LONG 
TERM IS SYSTEM THAT APPROACHES IN THE LATE MONDAY NIGHT/EARLY
TUESDAY MORNING TIME FRAME AND LINGERS INTO THURSDAY. MODELS ARE
NOW IN SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM...WITH TRACK OF
MAIN SURFACE LOW REMAINING WELL SOUTH AND EAST OF OUR FORECAST
AREA. HOWEVER...APPEARS NORTHERN/WESTERN FRINGE OF THIS SYSTEM
WILL BRUSH OUR FORECAST AREA ON TUESDAY WITH RELATIVELY TIGHT POPS
GRADIENT FROM NORTHWEST TO SOUTHEAST. EXPECT PRECIP TO GENERALLY BE
VERY LIGHT. UPPER LEVEL SUPPORT WILL CAUSE SCATTERED PRECIP TO
LINGER INTO THURSDAY...ESPECIALLY IN THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES. WITH
TEMPS REMAINING WELL BELOW CLIMO...APPEARS PRECIP TYPE WILL BE
PREDOMINATELY SNOW WITH THIS EVENT. BALANCE OF LONG TERM STILL
APPEARS DRY AT THIS TIME... WITH TEMPS SLOWLY MODERATING TO NEAR
CLIMO AS EASTERN CONUS LONGWAVE TROUGH FINALLY DEAMPLIFIES.

THIS AFTERNOON. INFRARED SATELLITE PICS DO SHOW AN ENHANCED AREA 
ROTATING SOUTH FROM EASTERN PARTS OF THE OHIO VALLEY...ON THE 
BACKSIDE OF THE LARGE UPPER LOW CENTERED OVER NY. MODELS BRING 
ANOTHER SLUG OF LOW LEVEL MOISTURE (SHALLOW OVER ALL BUT SW VA AND 
EXTREME NE TN) OVERNIGHT AND DEVELOP SOME WEAK UPSLOPE FLOW. NOT 
TOTALLY SOLD ON MORE THAN A VERY LIGHT ACCUMULATION OF SNOW OVER 
HIGHER TERRAIN OF SW VA INTO NE CORNER OF TN...AS SNOW GROWTH LOOKS 
QUESTIONABLE OUTSIDE OF THOSE AREAS...EVEN OVER SMOKIES.

HOWEVER...CAN'T RULE OUT AN INCH OR TWO OF SNOW LATE TONIGHT INTO 
SUNDAY MORNING...AND AN ADVISORY FOR OUR FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS WILL 
ALSO MESH WELL WITH NEIGHBORING OFFICES. LOWERED POPS FOR EARLY THIS 
EVENING...THEN LIKELY FOR ADVISORY AREAS INTO SUNDAY MORNING. EXPECT 
DIMINISHING SNOW SHOWERS TO JUST FLURRIES IN THE AFTERNOON.

WEAK RIDGE TRIES TO BUILDING AS CURRENT TROUGH EXITS TO 
NORTHEAST...BUT NEXT TROUGH RACES INTO PLACE FOR THE MIDDLE PORTION 
OF THE WEEK.  SYSTEM ALONG GULF COAST ON MONDAY IS EXPECTED TO 
SPREAD LIGHT PRECIP IN THE AREA AS IT CUTS ITS WAY OVER TO THE 
ATLANTIC SEABOARD TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY.  WITH MOST OF THE MOISTURE 
HAVING TO COME OVER THE MOUNTAINS...THINK THAT PRECIP WILL BE VERY 
LIGHT OVERALL...WITH BEST AMOUNTS ALONG THE SPINE OF THE 
APPALACHIANS.  PRECIP TYPE MAY BE AN ISSUE OVER THE SOUTHERN HALF OF 
THE AREA TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY AS WARM AIR TRIES TO PENETRATE 
NORTHWARD.  FINALLY ON THURSDAY THIS SYSTEM WILL BE EXITING TO THE 
NORTHEAST.  THEN FRIDAY AND SATURDAY LOOK DRY AND FINALLY WARMER.

STAY PRETTY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE TEMPS...ALTHOUGH WENT AT LEAST A 
CATEGORY COOLER FOR HIGHS ON TUESDAY...AND FOR THE NORTHEAST 1/2 OF 
THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY DUE TO THICKER CLOUD COVER.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LARGE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE NORTHEAST...WITH A LEE TROUGH 
EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS. 
THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO REMAIN QUASI-STATIONARY OVER 
THE NORTHEAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH A FEW UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVES 
ROTATING AROUND THE PARENT UPPER LOW. THE FIRST SHORT WAVE WAS 
APPROACHING SOUTHWEST VA EARLY THIS MORNING...BRINGING AN INCREASE 
IN CLOUDS AND SOME LIGHT SNOW. GFS AND NAM MODELS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THAT THIS INITIAL SHORT WAVE WILL WEAKEN AFTER SUNRISE... 
WITH THE NEXT UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE PROGGED TO ROTATE ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA THIS EVENING. MODELS SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT MOISTURE 
WILL BE TRAPPED BENEATH A STRONG MID LEVEL INVERSION ABOVE 850 MB... 
SO THINK THAT THIS SNOW WILL BE MORE STRATIFORM THAN CONVECTIVE IN 
NATURE. AS A RESULT...DO NOT EXPECT MUCH UPSLOPE ENHANCEMENT TO THE 
SNOWFALL ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...AND WITH ONLY UP TO AN INCH 
OF SNOWFALL ACCUMS EXPECTED IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...WILL NOT PLAN 
TO ISSUE ANY WINTER WX ADVISORIES FOR TODAY OR TONIGHT. CLOUDS 
SHOULD CONTINUE TO GRADUALLY INCREASE FROM NORTH TO SOUTH ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA TODAY...AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE NORTHEAST 
RETROGRADES A LITTLE TO THE SOUTHWEST. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS REVEAL SOME DISCREPANCIES FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...AND WILL 
PLAN TO TREND TOWARDS THE NAM NUMBERS WITH COOLER MAXES AND WARMER 
MINS ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA DUE TO THE 
INCREASE IN CLOUDS. 


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...WEAK UPPER RIDGING BRIEFLY 
BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON MONDAY AFTER 
NORTHWEST CYCLONIC FLOW FINALLY ABATES BY LATE SUNDAY AS PERSISTENT 
UPPER LOW MIGRATES AWAY FROM THE NORTHEASTERN STATES. ANOTHER SYSTEM 
APPROACHES IN THE LATE MONDAY/EARLY TUESDAY TIME FRAME. STILL QUITE 
A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS SYSTEM AS A CONSENSUS OF THE MODELS

BACK INTO PARTS OF SW VA AND EXTREME NE CORNER OF TN THIS AFTERNOON
...AND EXPECT CLOUDS TO INCREASE OVERNIGHT AS A VORTICITY LOBE 
ROTATES SE AROUND THE UPPER LOW OVER THE NEW ENGLAND STATES. LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE RETURNS TO ALL BUT SE TN AND SW NC LATE TONIGHT 
THROUGH SATURDAY...WITH SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATION POSSIBLE ACROSS 
WISE...RUSSELL...AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES OF SW VA INTO NRN MTNS OF 
EAST TN. AMOUNTS MAY TOTAL UP TO ADVISORY RANGE BY LATE SATURDAY 
AFTERNOON OR EVENING...BUT WILL DEFER ISSUANCE OF AN ADVISORY TO

OTHERWISE...WENT NEAR OR JUST BELOW A MOS BLEND FOR MINS TONIGHT
AND TRENDED MUCH CLOSER TO THE COOLER NAM MOS FOR SATURDAY HIGHS.

SHORT TERM CONCERN WAS OUR WIND ADVISORY...WHICH I HAVE OPTED TO 
CANCEL WITH THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE AS GUSTS HAVE REMAINED BELOW 30

THE NORTHEAST UNITED STATES INCREASING UPSLOPE MOISTURE INTO THE

ANOTHER WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY MAY BE REQUIRED FOR THESE AREAS.

FOR SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...DEEP UPPER TROUGH OVER THE NORTHEAST 
FINALLY LIFTS EASTWARD ALLOWING A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE TO BUILD 
INTO THE AREA.

ANOTHER STRONG UPPER TROUGH WILL LIFT OUT OF THE SOUTHERN PLAINS 
MONDAY NIGHT INTO THE TUESDAY. AT THE SAME TIME...ANOTHER NORTHERN 
STREAM WAVE WILL MOVE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY. SOME DIFFERENCES IN HOW 
MUCH CYCLO-GENESIS OCCURS WITH SOUTHERN STREAM WAVE...BUT GFS SHOWS
STRONG SURFACE LOW DEVELOPING. PRECIPITATION WILL MOVE BACK INTO THE 
FORECAST AREA TUESDAY WITH MAINLY SNOW (POSSIBLY BEGINNING AS RAIN 
SOUTH AND CENTRAL). AMOUNTS IS STILL UNCERTAIN GIVEN UNCERTAINTY OF

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE NORTHEAST...WITH A LEE TROUGH 
EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS. 
THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO REMAIN QUASI-STATIONARY OVER 
THE NORTHEAST TODAY AND TONIGHT...WITH NORTHWESTERLY UPPER-LEVEL 
FLOW LINGERING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS SOUNDINGS INDICATE 
THAT MOISTURE WILL BE SHALLOW AND LIMITED TODAY...WITH A STRONG MID 
LEVEL INVERSION ABOVE 850 MB. THUS...EXPECT LESS SNOW SHOWER 
ACTIVITY THAN IN PREVIOUS DAYS...AND WILL PLAN TO LET THE WINTER 
WEATHER ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS EXPIRE ON TIME AT 4 AM THIS MORNING. 
A TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT WILL REMAIN OVER THE REGION TODAY...AND 
EXPECT GUSTY WINDS TO DEVELOP BY THIS AFTERNOON...ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER...IT APPEARS THAT 
SUSTAINED WIND SPEEDS MAY NOT BE STRONG ENOUGH FOR A WIND ADVISORY 
(GREATER THAN THE 25 MPH) OUTSIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. WHILE IT SHOULD 
BE A BREEZY DAY ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA...WILL PLAN TO 
CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORY FOR MOST OF NORTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST VA. 
HOWEVER...WILL CONTINUE THE WIND ADVISORY UNTIL SUNSET ACROSS THE 
MOUNTAINS OF EAST TN. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT...BUT WILL COMPROMISE WHERE 
DIFFERENCES ARE NOTED. WILL ALSO PLAN TO USE A LARGE LAPSE RATE TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THE COOLER TEMPS DUE TO SNOW COVER ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...ANOTHER SHORT WAVE TROUGH 
WILL ROTATE AROUND PARENT UPPER LOW ON SATURDAY NIGHT AS UPPER LOW 
MEANDERS IN THE NEW ENGLAND AREA. THIS WILL RESULT IN DEEPER 
LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE AND THUS ENHANCE POPS IN FAVORED UPSLOPE 
LOCATIONS. UPPER RIDGING VERY BRIEFLY BUILDS INTO THE REGION ON 
MONDAY BEFORE ANOTHER TROUGH APPROACHES ON TUESDAY. STILL QUITE A 
BIT OF UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS SYSTEM AS GFS PAINTS WIDESPREAD PRECIP 
ACROSS THE AREA WHILE GEFS ENSEMBLES KEEP MOST OF PRECIP SOUTH AND 
EAST. SLIGHTLY RAISED POPS FOR TUESDAY TO CHANCE EVERYWHERE WITH 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS LINGERING INTO WEDNESDAY. KEPT REMAINDER OF

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...PERSISTENT PATTERN OF
SNOW SHOWERS DROPPING SE FROM SE KY ACROSS SW VA AND NE TN THIS
AFTERNOON. LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW...COLD AIR ADVECTION AND SOME
WEAK INSTABILITY SHOULD LAST INTO THE EVENING HOURS...SO SOME
ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED IN THE WARNING AREAS OF
SW VA AND NRN MTNS OF EAST TN. DROPPED SMOKIES BACK TO A WINTER
WEATHER ADVISORY (SIMILAR TO LEE AND SCOTT COUNTIES OF VA) AND
EXTENDED WARNING AND ADVISORY THROUGH 4 AM EST FRIDAY. WILL LET
LATER SHIFTS DECIDE TO CANCEL OR EXTEND INTO FRIDAY IF NEEDED.
SNOW AMOUNTS HAVE VARIED GREATLY FROM BARELY FLURRIES TO AN INCH OR
TWO OF NEW SNOW WHERE THE SNOW SHOWERS HAVE PASSED OVER.

PRESSURE GRADIENT TIGHTENS OVERNIGHT AND LOW LEVEL JET REACHES 40
TO 45 KNOTS...SO I ALSO ISSUED A WIND ADVISORY FROM MIDNIGHT TO 4PM
FRIDAY...FOR SW VA/NE TN/SMOKIES.

OTHERWISE...EXPECT LESS SNOW SHOWERS FOR FRIDAY THEN A LIKELY
BREAK IN ANY WINTRY PRECIPITATION...BEFORE ANOTHER SHORT WAVE
PASSES ACROSS THE REGION LATE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY. 

SNOW ACCUMULATING TODAY AND TONIGHT PLUS SOME LINGERING CLOUDINESS
OVER SW VA AND NE TN...SUPPORTED UNDERCUTTING MAX TEMPS EVEN BELOW
THE COOLER NAM MOS. MOS MINS MORE REASONABLE AND I GENERALLY
FOLLOWED THE COLDER MINS. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MODELS NOT 
SIGNIFICANTLY DISSIMILAR DURING THE PERIOD. STAYED CLOSER TO THE 
SLIGHTLY SLOWER AND DEEPER ECMWF SOLUTION WHICH KEEPS THE BLOCKING 
PATTERN IN PLACE WITH UPPER LEVEL LOW PRESSURE STUCK OVER THE 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. THE LOW DRIFTS ONLY SLOWLY EAST KEEPING A 
NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW REGIME GOING ALL THE WAY INTO SUNDAY NIGHT. THIS 
REGIME HIGHLIGHTS SNOW IN THE MAJOR OROGRAPHIC PARTS OF THE FORECAST 
AREA INCLUDING THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AND THE TERRAIN ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. THERE COULD 
BE A BREAK IN THE ACTION ON MONDAY BEFORE THE JET STREAM GETS ACTIVE 
AGAIN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TIER OF THE NATION. SHORT WAVE DRIVES EAST 
ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. LATER MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY 
NIGHT. JUST A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME CONCERNING THE TRACK 
AND STRENGTH OF THIS FEATURE AND THE POSSIBILITY OF PHASING WITH 
NORTHERN STREAM ENERGY SO MAINTAINED SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS AT 
THIS TIME. SYSTEM DEPARTS TO THE ATLANTIC COAST FOR WEDNESDAY AND 
HEIGHTS BUILD INTO THURSDAY SO KEPT THE LAST COUPLE DAYS OF THE 
EXTENDED DRY. THOUGHT IT BEST TO UNDERCUT TEMP GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT

.AVIATION...NORTHWEST FLOW SNOW MACHINE AT WORK TODAY WITH SHORT
WAVE ENHANCEMENT. SCATTERED TO NUMEROUS SNOW SHOWERS CONTINUE WHICH
ARE LIMITING VSBY TO MVFR AND EVEN IFR AT TIMES IN LIGHT TO
MODERATE SNOW AT TRI AND TYS. NICE FLOW OF MOISTURE OFF THE GREAT
LAKES AND CEILINGS ARE DROPPING INTO MVFR RANGE IN AREAS OF BETTER
LIFT AT TYS AND TRI. THE UPPER LEVEL LOW WHICH IS DRIVING THE FLOW
PATTERN WILL GRADUALLY SLIP EAST TO THE ATLANTIC COAST THROUGH THE

CONDITIONS. HOWEVER THE BEST FLYING WEATHER MAY NOT DEVELOP UNTIL
AFTER 14Z ON FRIDAY AS VFR CONDITIONS DOMINATE AT CHA AND TYS.
MAINTAINED MVFR CEILING AT TRI THROUGH THE TAF BUT THIS MAY LIFT

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...GFS/NAM/SREF REMAIN IN 
REASONABLY GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE 
REMAINS TRAPPED UNDER INVERSION AT LEAST THROUGH THE OVERNIGHT 
HOURS. THUS...DO NOT EXPECT MUCH CHANGE FROM THE PERSISTENT LOW 
OVERCAST AND OCCASIONAL DRIZZLE THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD. LIGHT 
FREEZING DRIZZLE POSSIBLE IN SOME LOCATIONS AS TEMPS FALL TO NEAR OR 
BELOW FREEZING. SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM APPROACHES THE REGION ON 
WEDNESDAY BUT IS PROJECTED TO REMAIN MAINLY SOUTH AND EAST OF OUR 
AREA. DID CONTINUE CHANCE POPS ALONG THE EASTERN FRINGE AND 
NORTHEASTERN ZONES OF OUR FORECAST AREA HOWEVER WITH SLIGHT CHANCE 
POPS ELSEWHERE. FOR TEMPS...FAVORED BLEND OF GUIDANCE VALUES IN
THE FIRST PERIOD...AND FAVORED COOLER MET GUIDANCE VALUES IN THE
SECOND PERIOD.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
A CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL DROP SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT...THEN CROSS THE CENTRAL APPALACHIANS ON THURSDAY. 
VERY COLD TEMPERATURES ALOFT WILL CREATE STEEP LAPSE RATES FOR SNOW 
SHOWERS IN THE NORTHERN HALF OF OUR AREA...AND A 25-35 KT 850 MB 
WIND FROM THE NORTHWEST WILL PROVIDE ENHANCED LIFT IN HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS. FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE THAT MOISTURE WILL EXTEND AS 
HIGH AS THE -20C LEVEL...SUFFICIENTLY DEEP FOR DENDRITE GROWTH. A 
LIMITING FACTOR WILL BE WEAK LARGE-SCALE DYNAMIC FORCING...WHICH 
MEANS THAT MOST SNOW ACCUMULATION WILL BE IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN DUE 
TO UPSLOPE FLOW ENHANCEMENT. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS FOR SW VA AND THE 
TN MOUNTAINS...AND WILL ISSUE A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR THE SAME AREA 
FROM 00Z THURSDAY TO MIDNIGHT THURSDAY NIGHT. RIGHT NOW...USING A 
SNOW-LIQUID RATIO OF 15:1...3-6 INCHES LOOKS POSSIBLE IN HIGHER 
TERRAIN...WITH 1-2 IN LOWER ELEVATIONS OF NE TN AND SW VA. 

THE CLOSED LOW MOVES OVER NEW ENGLAND BY FRIDAY...WARMING TEMPS 
ALOFT SHOULD END ANY SNOW SHOWERS BY THEN. THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
WILL REMAIN IN A PERSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW ALOFT THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND. THIS SHOULD RESULT IN BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES. THE LATEST 
GFS BRINGS A SHORTWAVE TROUGH AROUND THE CLOSED LOW THROUGH OUR AREA 
ON SATURDAY...BUT WILL WAIT FOR BETTER RUN-TO-RUN CONTINUITY BEFORE 
ADDING ANY PRECIP. THE GFS AND ECMWF DO AGREE ON A SOUTHERN STREAM 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MOVING ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH ON MONDAY THROUGH 
TUESDAY. WILL HAVE SLIGHT TO LOW CHANCE POPS DURING THIS TIME FRAME 
ACROSS THE AREA.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...MODELS CONTINUE IN REASONABLY 
GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. EASTERN CONUS LONG WAVE 
TROUGH BECOMES RE-ESTABLISHED. A FEW MINOR SHORT WAVES TRAVERSE 
THROUGH THE FLOW OF THE LONG WAVE TROUGH. HOWEVER... NORTHWEST 
CYCLONIC FLOW REMAIN RATHER WEAK. THUS NOT ANTICIPATING ANY 
SIGNIFICANT UPSLOPE EVENT IN THE SHORT TERM. DID KEEP POPS CONFINED 
MAINLY TO THE HIGHER TERRAIN HOWEVER. FOR TEMPS...TENDED TO FAVOR 
COOLER MET GUIDANCE FOR THE MOST PART.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
A WEAK SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL PASS TO OUR SOUTH ON 
TUESDAY NIGHT AND EARLY WEDNESDAY. THE NAM AND GFS HAVE SOME 
DIFFERENCES WITH THIS FEATURE...BUT IT LOOKS LIKE THE BEST LIFT AND 
MOISTURE WILL STAY TO OUR SOUTH AND EAST. WILL GO DRY FOR TUESDAY 
NIGHT. A MUCH MORE SIGNIFICANT NORTHERN STREAM CLOSED LOW APPROACHES 
FROM THE NORTHWEST ON WEDNESDAY. LARGE SCALE Q-G FORCING AHEAD OF 
THE LOW WILL PROVIDE SOME WEAK LIFT WEDNESDAY AFTERNOON...MAINLY 
ACROSS OUR NORTHERN SECTIONS. WILL HAVE CHANCE POPS NORTH WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON.

THE CLOSED UPPER LOW WILL BE TRACKING ACROSS THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS THROUGH THURSDAY...BRINGING A SURGE OF COLD AIR ALOFT 
WEDNESDAY NIGHT. THE RESULTING STEEP LAPSE RATES AND NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW AT 850 MB WILL HELP TO GENERATE SNOW SHOWERS IN THE MOUNTAINS 
AND NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE CHANCE 
RANGE FOR NOW AS MOISTURE APPEARS TO BE FAIRLY LIMITED. TEMPERATURES 
WILL ONCE AGAIN DROP WELL BELOW NORMAL...WITH HIGHS THURSDAY IN THE 
30S NORTH AND CENTRAL WITH 40S IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY. 

AS THE LOW MOVES OVER NEW ENGLAND ON FRIDAY AND BECOMES NEARLY 
STATIONARY...WE SHOULD BEGIN TO SEE DRIER CONDITIONS AND A SLIGHT 
WARMING TREND. HOWEVER THE EASTERN CONUS WILL REMAIN UNDER THE 
INFLUENCE OF A LONGWAVE TROUGH AND THE UPPER JET WILL STAY TO OUR 
SOUTH...SO TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE TO BE BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE 
WEEKEND. CONFIDENCE IS LOW REGARDING THE POSITION OF THE CLOSED LOW 
AND ANY SHORTWAVES MOVING AROUND IT...SO WILL KEEP THE LAST FEW DAYS

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
OZARKS...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE 
LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS A PRE-FRONTAL LINE 
OF CONVECTION AHEAD OF THIS FRONT ACROSS LA AND MS...WITH THE 
NORTHERN EDGE OF THE LIGHTNING STRIKES OCCURRING AROUND THE SOUTHERN 
TN BORDER. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL SOME WEAK ELEVATED INSTABILITY 
ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN LATER TONIGHT...SO WILL PLAN TO ADD A CHANCE OF 
THUNDER FOR SOUTHEAST TN. THESE SOUNDINGS ALSO REVEAL A STABLE 
BOUNDARY LAYER STRENGTHENING ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA...WITH 
SOUTHERLY WINDS ALSO INCREASING AHEAD OF THE APPROACHING FRONT. AS A 
RESULT...THINK THAT SOME MOUNTAIN WAVES WILL BE POSSIBLE AROUND THE 
FOOTHILLS OF THE MOUNTAINS LATER TONIGHT...ESPECIALLY AROUND SUNRISE 
AS A DECENT 850 MB JET (AROUND 50 KT) APPROACHES THE FORECAST AREA. 
THUS...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE A WIND ADVISORY FOR THE OVERNIGHT HOURS TO 
ACCOUNT FOR THIS SCENARIO. OTHERWISE...PRECIP TIMING AND TEMP 
FORECAST STILL APPEAR TO BE ON TRACK FOR TONIGHT...SO WILL ONLY MAKE 
A FEW MINOR TWEAKS BASED ON THE CURRENT TRENDS.

CLOUDS AT TIMES...ESPECIALLY NORTH...BUT OVERALL SHOULD BE MAINLY 
CLEAR/MOSTLY SUNNY FOR THE PERIOD.  MAV TEMPS GENERALLY LOOK

CONTINUES THROUGH THE EARLY PORTION OF THE LONG TERM WITH TEMPS 
PROJECTED TO BE WELL ABOVE CLIMO ON SUNDAY AND INTO MONDAY AS 
APPROACHING TROUGH INDUCES UPPER RIDGING OVER THE SOUTHERN 
APPALACHIAN REGION. THIS WILL BE RELATIVELY SHORT LIVED HOWEVER AS 
UPPER TROUGH AND ACCOMPANYING SURFACE COLD FRONT PROGRESS EASTWARD 
AND THROUGH THE REGION BY MONDAY. HAVE CONTINUED LIKELY POPS SUNDAY 
NIGHT...AND INTO MONDAY FOR THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES AS SYSTEM
TRAVERSES THE AREA. KEPT BALANCE OF FORECAST AFTER TUESDAY DRY IN
SPITE OF GFS PROJECTION OF A SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WHICH
APPROACHES ON WEDNESDAY. THIS IS NOT DEPICTED IN THE ECMWF MODEL
AND TENDED TO FAVOR ITS SOLUTION FOR CONSISTENCY SAKE. HOWEVER...
SOME OF THE GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS SUPPORT THE GFS...AND SUBSEQUENT
RUNS MAY REQUIRE THE INTRODUCTION OF POPS FOR MID WEEK. FOR TEMPS...
TENDED TO FAVOR COOLER OF GUIDANCE VALUES EARLY IN THE LONG TERM
AND TENDED TO UNDERCUT MEX GUIDANCE AFTER PASSAGE OF THE EARLY WORK
WEEK SYSTEM AS THEY APPEAR GENERALLY TOO WARM GIVEN THE EXPECTED

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND FRIDAY)...MODELS INDICATE WEAK SURFACE 
HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO BUILD IN DURING THE SHORT TERM 
PERIOD...AS UPPER FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL.  RADAR AND OBS INDICATE 
SNOW SHOWERS HAVE MOSTLY ENDED OVER THE AREA...BUT STILL MAY BE A 
FEW FLURRIES LINGERING OVER NORTHERN MOUNTAINS AND SW VA INTO FIRST 
PART OF TONIGHT.  ANY LOW CLOUDS LINGERING OVER NORTHERN AREAS 
SHOULD DECREASE OVERNIGHT...THEN MOST AREAS SHOULD SEE QUITE A BIT 
OF SUNSHINE FRIDAY...ALONG WITH A MILDER AFTERNOON.  WILL NOT STRAY 
FAR FROM MAV TEMPS...WHICH LOOK REASONABLE OVERALL.   


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN CONCERN FOR THE 
LONG TERM IS UPPER TROUGH/SURFACE FRONT WHICH APPROACHES THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION IN THE LATE SUNDAY/EARLY MONDAY TIME 
FRAME. DOES NOT APPEAR THIS SYSTEM WILL BE VERY SIGNIFICANT AT THIS 
TIME. NEVERTHELESS...DID BUMP UP POPS TO LIKELY FOR MUCH OF THE 
FORECAST AREA FOR SUNDAY NIGHT. ALSO APPEARS THIS WILL BE PRIMARILY 
A RAIN EVENT WITH BRIEF WARMING TEMP TREND.

REMAINDER OF LONG TERM APPEARS GENERALLY DRY AT THIS TIME. MINOR 
SHORTWAVE SKIRTS TO OUR NORTH ON SATURDAY...BUT HAS VERY LITTLE 
MOISTURE TO WORK WITH. DID CONTINUE SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE POPS 
IN THE NORTHEASTERN ZONES FOR LATE SATURDAY BASED ON SREF TRENDS. 
ALSO KEPT SLIGHT CHANCE POPS IN FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS FOR TUESDAY ON 
THE BACKSIDE OF DEPARTING EARLY WORK WEEK SYSTEM. FOR TEMPS... 
GENERALLY DID NOT SIGNIFICANTLY DEVIATE FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE. OTHER 
THAN POSSIBLY MONDAY IN BRIEF WARMING TREND REGIME...TEMPS ARE 
PROJECTED TO REMAIN BELOW CLIMO AS HEIGHT ANOMALIES REMAIN NEGATIVE 
WITH EASTERN CONUS LONG WAVE TROUGH PERSISTING FOR THE FORESEEABLE 
FUTURE.

WEAKENING INSTABILITY ALONG WITH OROGRAPHIC LIFT TO GENERATE SOME 
LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA...EXTREME 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND THE MOUNTAINS BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA. 
EXTENDED THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY THROUGH MID DAY FOR THE 
POSSIBILITY OF ANOTHER INCH OF TWO OF ACCUMULATION IN THIS HIGHER 
TERRAIN REGION. A CHECK OF THE SATELLITE IMAGE WITH RAPIDLY CLEARING 
SKIES OUT TO THE WEST MAKES IT APPEAR THAT SKIES MAY GO PARTLY 
CLOUDY FOR A FEW HOURS ACROSS MUCH OF THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU AS WELL 
AS CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE TODAY. MODELS HINT AT ANOTHER WEAK WAVE 
POSSIBLY GENERATING MORE STRATO CU THIS AFTERNOON INTO EARLY EVENING 
SO KEPT MUCH OF THE FORECAST AREA MOSTLY CLOUDY HOWEVER THIS WILL 
HAVE TO BE MONITORED AS THE SKY CONDITION MAY END UP BEING MORE 
OPTIMISTIC. THE LIGHT SNOW MACHINE SHOULD BE ABOUT OUT OF GAS 
TONIGHT BUT MAY BE ABLE TO PRODUCE A FLURRY OR TWO IN THE HIGHEST 
TERRAIN SO KEPT A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SNOW SHOWERS HERE. FOR TEMPS 
STAYED CLOSE TO A GUIDANCE BLEND FOR MAXES WHILE GENERALLY 
UNDERCUTTING MINS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE WILL 
BE CROSSING THE AREA ON FRIDAY...AND SHOULD PROVIDE ABUNDANT 
SUNSHINE AND RELATIVELY MILD TEMPERATURES COMPARED TO WHAT WE HAVE 
HAD LATELY. AS THE RIDGE AXIS MOVES TO OUR EAST...A SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
WILL APPROACH AND BRING A SLIGHT CHANCE POP FOR LATE FRIDAY 
NIGHT/SATURDAY. LIFT IS QUITE WEAK AND MAINLY TO OUR NORTH. TIMING 
OF THE TROUGH IN THE LATE NIGHT/EARLY MORNING WILL MEAN THE PRECIP 
MAY BE SNOW...BUT IT SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT WITH LITTLE IF ANY 
ACCUMULATION. 

THE LATEST ECMWF IS DRIER THAN PREVIOUS RUNS FOR SATURDAY AND 
SATURDAY NIGHT...MORE IN LINE WITH THE GFS IN SHOWING A DRY ZONAL 
FLOW ALOFT. SO WILL REMOVE THE POPS FROM THAT TIME PERIOD. MEANWHILE 
A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM BEGINS TO TAKE SHAPE OVER THE PLAINS. THIS 
SYSTEM WILL TRACK EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH MONDAY. 
POSITIVE THETA-E ADVECTION AND ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BRING A SLIGHT 
CHANCE POP FOR SUNDAY...WITH HIGH CHANCE POPS BY SUNDAY NIGHT AS THE 
850 MB LOW MOVES ACROSS KY. A 45 KT 850 MB JET FROM THE SOUTHWEST 
WILL PROVIDE AMPLE WARM ADVECTION FOR AN ALL-RAIN EVENT. THE 
TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH ON MONDAY...BRINGING A RETURN OF 
COLDER TEMPS FOR TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. SOME UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS 
MAY ALSO BE POSSIBLE MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY BEHIND THE FRONT...BUT 
MOISTURE LOOKS LIMITED.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...EXCELLENT CONDITIONS FOR 
OROGRAPHIC SNOW PRODUCTION AGAIN TODAY WITH CONTINUATION OF 
NORTHWEST FLOW ON THE BACK SIDE OF NEW ENGLAND UPPER LOW. THE FLOW 
WILL YIELD A COUPLE OF SHORT WAVE FEATURES TO ENHANCE SNOW. THE 
FIRST WILL MOVE IN DURING THE DAY WHEN LAPSE RATE STRENGTHENS WITH 
FRIGID AIR ALOFT. STAYED WITH THE ADVISORY TO HIGHLIGHT BETTER 
ACCUMULATION IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE 
MOUNTAINS ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. IN THESE AREAS AMOUNTS 
COULD TOTAL 3 TO 4 INCHES WITH LESSER AMOUNTS BELOW 2500 FT. WENT 
CLOSER TO COLDER MET MOS GUIDANCE TEMPS TODAY WITH BKN-OVC LAYER 
LIMITING INSOLATION IN HEALTHY CAA. OROGRAPHIC SNOWFALL SHOULD BE 
SOMEWHAT LIGHTER TONIGHT TRENDING TOWARD THE FAR EAST TENNESSEE 
MOUNTAINS AS THE NORTHEAST STATES UPPER LOW GRADUALLY PULLS AWAY.  

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT BEGINS 
TO DECREASE ON THURSDAY AS AN UPPER RIDGE BEGINS TO BUILD OVER THE 
AREA. THERE MAY STILL BE SOME MOISTURE AVAILABLE IN THE LINGERING 
NORTHWEST FLOW...SO WILL KEEP A SLIGHT CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS IN THE 
MOUNTAINS AND SW VA. FRIDAY LOOKS DRY AS THE RIDGE CONTINUES TO 
BUILD. 

A WEAK SHORTWAVE TROUGH PASSES THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT/SATURDAY 
MORNING...AND WILL HAVE SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WITH THIS FEATURE. THE 
FLOW ALOFT IS NEARLY ZONAL THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN BECOMES 
MORE AMPLIFIED SUNDAY AS LOW PRESSURE TRACKS FROM THE PLAINS TO THE 
OHIO VALLEY. ADVECTION OF WARM/MOIST AIR WIL BRING POPS IN AS EARLY 
AS SATURDAY NIGHT...BUT THE HIGHEST POPS WILL BE SUNDAY NIGHT/MONDAY 
AS THE LOW TRACKS ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY. MOST OF THIS EVENT LOOKS 
TO BE RAIN...BUT THERE MAY BE SOME SNOW MONDAY NIGHT ON THE TAIL END

FOR CONTINUED LIGHT SNOW. WILL LEAVE ADVSRY IN PLACE FOR LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS. WINDS MAY HOLD UP TEMPS A BIT AND FCST MIN MAY
BE A DEGREE OR TWO ON THE COOL SIDE BUT TO CLOSE FOR UPDATE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LOW CONTINUES TO PULL 
WEAK IMPULSES INTO THE REGION AND NO CHANGE IN THE WEATHER PATTERN 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE SHORT TERM.  THEREFORE...EXPECT CONTINUED COLD 
TEMPERATURES AND OCCASIONAL LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES THROUGHOUT THE 
AREA.  SOME ACCUMULATIONS ARE EXPECTED OVER MAINLY HIGHER TERRAIN OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS... ESPECIALLY OVER 
FAVORED NORTHWEST FACING SLOPES WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW WILL ENHANCE 
SNOWFALL.  A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR THESE AREAS 
THROUGH 23Z WEDNESDAY.  

LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...PERSISTENT PATTERN OF 
CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT...W-NW LOW LEVEL WINDS...COLD AIR ADVECTION AND 
LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL SET THE STAGE FOR PROLONGED SNOW 
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES INTO THURSDAY...ACROSS NORTHERN HALF OF E TN AND 
SW VA.  SOME VERY LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS STILL POSSIBLE IN OUR 
FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS...AND WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES MAY NEED AN 
EXTENSION OUT TO 12Z THURSDAY OR SO.

GFS AND ECMWF START TO DIVERGE AS EARLY AS FRIDAY...AND EVEN MORE SO 
WITH THE PATTERN BY SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY...THUS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO 
DROP SHARPLY WITH TIME.  UPPER LEVEL FLOW FLATTENS BY FRIDAY AND I 
STILL FIND SOME AGREEMENT WITH MODELS ON A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH...COMING OUT OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS...AND PRODUCING A BRIEF 
SHOT OF LIGHT RAIN OR SNOW FOR THE TN VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS.
TIMED THIS SYSTEM FOR MAINLY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY FOR NOW.

EARLIER HPC PROGS WERE ALMOST PURE ECMWF MODEL...ALTHO GFS AND ECMWF 
DIFFER STRONGLY WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM FOR SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY. 12Z 
GFS RUN IS FASTER AND HAS NEW DAY 7 (TUESDAY) DRY...WHILE ECMWF IS 
MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED AND SLOWER...KEEPING MORE CLOUDS AND A CHANCE OF 
SNOW FOR TUESDAY.  THUS...WENT FOR A BIT OF A BLEND FOR NOW...ALTHO 
BOTH SOLUTIONS WOULD OFFER UP SOME LOW LEVEL WARMING FOR MONDAY AND 
A MOSTLY RAIN EVENT INITIALLY...BEFORE A CHANCE OF SNOW ON THE 
BACKSIDE AS THE SYSTEM MOVES EAST OF THE REGION.  OPTED FOR A DRY 
TUESDAY FOR NOW.

FOR TEMPS...TRENDED BELOW GFSX MOS AND HPC VALUES...ESPECIALLY 
EARLIER IN THE EXTENDED...DUE TO A LIKELY FAIR AMOUNT OF SNOW COVER 
FROM HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF EAST TN NORTH INTO SW VA.  EXTENDED 
CLOUDINESS PER SOUNDINGS AS THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LOOKS TO GET 
TRAPPED BELOW AN INVERSION...WITH A COOL NW LOW LEVEL FLOW...BOTH 
SUPPORTING COOLER THAN GUIDANCE MAX TEMPS.  TRENDED MORE IN LINE 
WITH MOS BY SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

WILL ENHANCE SNOWFALL.  A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY IS IN EFFECT FOR 
THESE AREAS THROUGH 23Z WEDNESDAY.  

.LONG TERM (WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...PERSISTENT PATTERN OF 
CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT...W-NW LOW LEVEL WINDS...COLD AIR ADVECTION AND
LINGERING LOW LEVEL MOISTURE WILL SET THE STAGE FOR PROLONGED SNOW 
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES INTO THURSDAY...ACROSS NORTHERN HALF OF E TN AND 
SW VA.  SOME VERY LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS STILL POSSIBLE IN OUR 
FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS...AND WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES MAY NEED AN 
EXTENSION OUT TO 12Z THURSDAY OR SO.

GFS AND ECMWF START TO DIVERGE AS EARLY AS FRIDAY...AND EVEN MORE SO 
WITH THE PATTERN BY SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY...THUS CONFIDENCE BEGINS TO 
DROP SHARPLY WITH TIME.  UPPER LEVEL FLOW FLATTENS BY FRIDAY AND I 
STILL FIND SOME AGREEMENT WITH MODELS ON A FAST MOVING SHORTWAVE 
TROUGH...COMING OUT OF THE CENTRAL PLAINS...AND PRODUCING A BRIEF 
SHOT OF LIGHT RAIN OR SNOW FOR THE TN VALLEY AND SRN APPALACHIANS.
TIMED THIS SYSTEM FOR MAINLY FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY FOR NOW.

EARLIER HPC PROGS WERE ALMOST PURE ECMWF MODEL...ALTHO GFS AND ECMWF 
DIFFER STRONGLY WITH THE NEXT SYSTEM FOR SUNDAY INTO TUESDAY. 12Z 
GFS RUN IS FASTER AND HAS NEW DAY 7 (TUESDAY) DRY...WHILE ECMWF IS 
MUCH MORE AMPLIFIED AND SLOWER...KEEPING MORE CLOUDS AND A CHANCE OF 
SNOW FOR TUESDAY.  THUS...WENT FOR A BIT OF A BLEND FOR NOW...ALTHO 
BOTH SOLUTIONS WOULD OFFER UP SOME LOW LEVEL WARMING FOR MONDAY AND 
A MOSTLY RAIN EVENT INITIALLY...BEFORE A CHANCE OF SNOW ON THE 
BACKSIDE AS THE SYSTEM MOVES EAST OF THE REGION.  OPTED FOR A DRY 
TUESDAY FOR NOW.

FOR TEMPS...TRENDED BELOW GFSX MOS AND HPC VALUES...ESPECIALLY 
EARLIER IN THE EXTENDED...DUE TO A LIKELY FAIR AMOUNT OF SNOW COVER 
FROM HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS OF EAST TN NORTH INTO SW VA.  EXTENDED 
CLOUDINESS PER SOUNDINGS AS THE LOW LEVEL MOISTURE LOOKS TO GET 
TRAPPED BELOW AN INVERSION...WITH A COOL NW LOW LEVEL FLOW...BOTH 
SUPPORTING COOLER THAN GUIDANCE MAX TEMPS.  TRENDED MORE IN LINE 
WITH MOS BY SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
A PERSISTENT NORTHWEST FLOW WILL KEEP A CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS 
ACROSS THE NORTHERN TIER OF THE FORECAST AREA THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT. TODAY...LOW LEVEL CAPE VALUES OF 40-60 J/KG ALONG WITH LAPSE 
RATES NEAR 10 C/KM WILL GENERATE SNOW SHOWERS...AND A 20 KT W-NW 
FLOW WILL ENHANCE THE SHOWERS IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS MAY REACH UP TO 2 INCHES IN THE MOUNTAINS AND HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS OF SW VA...WITH LESS THAN 1 INCH IN THE PLATEAU AND LOWER 
ELEVATIONS OF SW VA AND NE TN. WILL EXTEND THE ADVISORY TO 00Z THIS 
EVENING FOR SW VA AND THE TN MOUNTAINS. IN THE TN VALLEY...ISOLATED 
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES CAN BE EXPECTED WITH NO ACCUMULATIONS. SKIES 
SHOULD REMAIN MOSTLY CLOUDY ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA...AND WILL HAVE 
TEMPS BELOW MOS GUIDANCE TODAY. 

A CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT CONTINUES TONIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY 
NIGHT...BUT MOISTURE DEPTH WILL BE DECREASING. SO A CHANCE OF SNOW 
SHOWERS AND FLURRIES WILL REMAIN ACROSS NORTHERN SECTIONS...BUT 
ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE LIGHT. BY THURSDAY THE CLOSED UPPER LOW OVER 
NEW ENGLAND WILL PUSH FARTHER EAST AND AN UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD 
OVER THE AREA...ENDING ANY CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
A FAIR AMOUNT OF UNCERTAINTY DURING THE LONG TERM FORECAST PERIOD
AS MODELS DISSIMILAR IN SOLUTIONS WITH ECMWF A LITTLE FASTER AND
MORE AMPLIFIED THAN GFS. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO PREVIOUS FORECAST
WHILE ADDING SOME SLIGHT CHANCE POPS AS MODELS DEPICT AT LEAST A
COUPLE OF SHORTWAVE FEATURES DURING THE PERIOD WITH A FRONTAL ZONE
SETTING UP IN THE VICINITY OF THE FORECAST AREA SATURDAY NIGHT
THROUGH MONDAY WITH SHORTWAVE ENERGY PRESSING EAST ACROSS THE MID
SOUTH. PRECIP TYPE UNCERTAIN DURING THE PERIOD WITH SOME SNOW
POSSIBLE ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS THE NORTH WITH
BETTER POSSIBILITY OF RAIN ACROSS SOUTHEAST TENNESSEE. TWEAKED
TEMPERATURES SLIGHTLY HIGHER CLOSER TO MEX MOS GUIDANCE AND

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...THE COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED OUT OF 
THE AREA...BUT THE ASSOCIATED UPPER LOW TO OUR NORTH WILL CONTINUE 
TO ROTATE A SERIES OF IMPULSES THROUGH THE AREA DURING THE SHORT 
TERM.  EXPECT ANOTHER ROUND OF SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS WILL SLIDE 
IN OVERNIGHT...GENERATING ADDITIONAL MINOR ACCUMULATIONS.  VALLEY 
LOCATIONS COULD SEE A TRACE TO A HALF INCH WITH A FEW BANDS NEAR AN 
INCH POSSIBLE.  HIGHER TERRAIN OF UP TO AN INCH WITH LOCAL 2 INCHES 
POSSIBLE.  WILL KEEP CURRENT WSW IN PLACE WHILE ACCUMULATING 
SNOWFALL IS EXPECTED.  ON TUESDAY...ANOTHER IMPULSE TRACK THROUGH.  
THIS ALONG WITH UPSLOPE FLOW SHOULD BRING LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS TO THE 
EAST TN MOUNTAINS AND NORTHERN LOCATIONS.  ADDITIONALLY...BEHIND THE 
FRONT...GUSTY WINDS WILL PULL IN ANOTHER BLAST OF COLD AIR...KEEPING 
TEMPERATURES WELL BELOW NORMAL.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...EARLY PERIODS OF THE 
EXTENDED WILL FEATURE A PATTERN THAT HAS PERSISTED FOR MUCH OF THIS 
WINTER SEASON...1) CYCLONIC FLOW ALOFT...2) MODERATE TO STRONG COLD 
AIR ADVECTION IN THE LOW LEVELS...AND 3) LINGERING LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE.  THUS...EXPECT SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS IN THE FAVORED 
UPSLOPE AREAS AND ISOLATED SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES JUST ABOUT 
ANYWHERE ELSE AT TIMES INTO THURSDAY.  NUDGED POPS UP A BIT IN THE 
UPSLOPE AREAS NEXT TO NEIGHBORING OFFICES...MAINLY FOR TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT...AND ADDED SOME LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN 
THESE AREAS.  BY THURSDAY...MOISTURE LOOKS TO BECOME QUITE SHALLOW 
AND THE FLOW ALOFT BECOMES VERY BRIEFLY NEARLY ZONAL...SO SHOULD 
TREND TO JUST FLURRIES AT THAT TIME. 

HOWEVER...BEYOND THURSDAY...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES BEGIN TO DIVERGE 
ENOUGH THAT CONFIDENCE IS LOW ON HOW LONG OF A PERIOD A DRY FORECAST 
IS IN ORDER.  GFS AND ECMWF BOTH SHOW A SHORTWAVE TROUGH MOVING EAST 
FROM THE CENTRAL PLAINS LATE FRIDAY INTO SATURDAY...ALTHO TIMING AND 
STRENGTH DIFFERS...AS DOES THE AREA AND EXTENT OF ASSOCIATED 
PRECIPITATION (PCPN).  SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL WARMING TO ALLOW FOR A 
MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW SOUTH TO MOSTLY SNOW NORTH.  ADDED CHANCE POPS 
ACROSS THE REGION ON SATURDAY FOR NOW.

OTHERWISE...KEPT SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MOST OF SUNDAY NIGHT DRY...
WITH YET ANOTHER SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM INDICATED BY MONDAY.  THIS 
SYSTEM LOOKS TO TAP MORE GULF MOISTURE AND ALSO SOME WARMER AIR.
KEPT MAX TEMPS A LITTLE BELOW GFSX MOS...UNTIL THIS SOUTHERN STREAM 
SYSTEM BRINGS SOME SOUTH TO SOUTHWEST LOW LEVEL FLOW.

SURFACE FRONT IS MOVING ACROSS THE WESTERN PORTIONS OF THE 
CWA...WITH STRATIFORM PRECIP TRAILING THE FRONT. PRECIP MAY BEGIN AS 
A MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW...BUT AS COLD ADVECTION KICKS IN BEHIND THE 
FRONT...IT SHOULD CHANGE TO ALL SNOW. THE BAND OF PRECIP IS FAIRLY 
NARROW AND SHOULD ONLY LAST FOR A FEW HOURS...BUT THE SNOW MAY BE 
HEAVY AT TIMES. EXPECT ACCUMULATIONS THIS MORNING ON THE ORDER OF 1 
TO 3 INCHES ACROSS THE AREA THIS MORNING. MIDLEVEL DRYING WILL MOVE 
IN THIS AFTERNOON...DECREASING SNOW COVERAGE AND INTENSITY...AND 
WILL LOWER AFTERNOON POPS TO A CHANCE AFTER 20Z. HOWEVER THE SNOW 
SHOULD PICK BACK UP AGAIN TONIGHT AS THE CLOSED UPPER LOW MOVES 
ACROSS...CREATING STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES...ESPECIALLY ACROSS 
THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. AN INCREASING NORTHWESTERLY 
FLOW...UP TO 40 KTS AT 850 MB...WILL ENHANCE SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN 
THE MOUNTAINS. AN ADDITIONAL 1 TO 3 INCHES IS EXPECTED IN THE 
MOUNTAINS AND NORTHERN AREAS TONIGHT. WILL NOT MAKE ANY SIGNIFICANT 
CHANGES TO THE CURRENT WSW. OUR HIGH TEMPERATURES TODAY MAY OCCUR IN 
THE MORNING AS 850 MB TEMPS AROUND -14C ADVENT INTO THE AREA THIS 
AFTERNOON. 

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON TUESDAY.  WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST 
CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  ANY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE LIGHT.  
ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY. WITH 
ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE AVAILABLE...WILL KEEP ONLY LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
THE NORTHERN AREAS ON WEDNESDAY. ANY SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE 
LIGHT AGAIN. ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE NORTHERN 
AREAS ON THURSDAY. WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE EXPECTED...WILL KEEP 
THURSDAY DRY.  HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR 
FRIDAY. A FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
245 PM EST SUN FEB 14 2010

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED NEAR THE CONFLUENCE OF 
THE OHIO AND MS RIVERS...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING 
SOUTH ALONG THE LOWER MS RIVER VALLEY. A STRONG UPPER-LEVEL CUT-OFF 
LOW OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS (SEEN ON SATELLITE IMAGERY NEAR KANSAS 
CITY) IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY LATER TONIGHT...AND INTENSIFY THE SURFACE LOW AS IT MOVES 
EAST ACROSS KY. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE STRONG 
DYNAMICS WITH THIS SYSTEM WILL DEVELOP A WIDESPREAD COVERAGE OF 
PRECIP ALONG THE COLD FRONT ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE 
FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODELS ARE TRENDING A LITTLE SLOWER 
WITH THIS SYSTEM...AND NOW INDICATE THAT THE COLD FRONT WILL MOVE 
THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA AFTER MIDNIGHT. MODELS SOUNDINGS REVEAL A 
WARM BOUNDARY LAYER LINGERING IN THE GREAT TN VALLEY UNTIL TOWARDS 
SUNRISE...SO THINK THAT SNOW AND RAIN MAY MIX IN THE VALLEY AREAS 
BELOW 2500 FEET UNTIL LATE TONIGHT. MAIN QUESTION WITH THIS SYSTEM 
WILL BE HOW MUCH SNOW CAN ACCUMULATE DUE TO THE WARM BOUNDARY LAYER 
IN THE VALLEYS AND THE QUICK SHOT OF HEAVIER PRECIP WITH THE FRONT. 
MODELS GENERATE AROUND A QUARTER OF AN INCH OF LIQUID EQUIVALENT 
ACROSS THE SOUTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF THE FORECAST AREA BY 12Z...BUT 
THINK THAT A HEAVY WET SNOW (WITH LOW SNOW TO LIQUID RATIOS OF 5:1) 
WILL LIKELY DEVELOP. THUS...WILL CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT WINTER WX 
ADVISORY FOR MOST EVERYWHERE...BUT WILL UPGRADE EXTREME SOUTHEAST 
TN...SOUTHWEST NC...AND SMOKY MTNS TO A WARNING WHERE A HIGHER 
LIQUID/SNOW RATIO IS EXPECTED RESULTING IN GREATER THAN FOUR INCHES 
IN 12 HOURS (AND SIX INCHES IN 24 HOURS). WITH NORTHWESTERLY FLOW 
DEVELOPING BEHIND THE PASSAGE OF THE CUT-OFF UPPER-LOW BY MONDAY 
AFTERNOON...THINK THIS EVENT SHOULD TRANSITION OVER TO AN UPSLOPE 
SNOW SHOWER EVENT WITH ANY ADDITIONAL SNOW ACCUMULATIONS MAINLY 
AFFECTING THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. AS FOR TEMPS...MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AND LOOK REASONABLE. 
HOWEVER...WILL PLAN TO UNDERCUT THESE NUMBERS A LITTLE BY MONDAY 
NIGHT WITH SOME SNOW COVER EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...AN UPPER TROUGH WILL REMAIN 
POSITIONED OVER THE EASTERN U.S. EARLY IN THE EXTENDED...AND SERIES 
OF WEAK IMPULSES ROTATING THROUGH WILL PERIODICALLY BRING IN 
ISOLATED TO SCATTERED LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES MAINLY OVER THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS IN THE NORTHEAST TUESDAY THROUGH THURSDAY.  AN 
UPPER RIDGE WILL BUILD IN FOR FRIDAY.  A QUICK MOVING FRONTAL SYSTEM 
WILL SLIDE THROUGH AROUND THE SATURDAY TIME FRAME.  CONFIDENCE LOW 
ON TIMING AND STRENGTH...SO WILL KEEP LOW POPS CONFINED TO JUST 
SATURDAY FOR NOW AND LEAVE SUNDAY DRY.  WILL CONTINUE TO SEE 
TEMPERATURES BELOW NORMAL THROUGH THE PERIOD.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE MID MS 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST OVER 
THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. THIS SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO MOVE EAST ACROSS KY 
THIS AFTERNOON...WITH MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASING ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA. AREA RADARS REVEAL SOME LIGHT SNOW OVER THE 
SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU SPREADING INTO SOUTHEAST TN...BUT 
SOUTHWESTERLY FLOW AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT SHOULD WARM TEMPS INTO 
THE UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S THIS AFTERNOON. THUS...THIS SNOW SHOULD

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
CLOSED LOW OVER THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL BE DROPPING SOUTHEAST 
TODAY...AND PUSHING A FRONT THROUGH THE AREA TONIGHT. CLOUDS WILL BE 
BROKEN TO OVERCAST THROUGH THE DAY AS MOISTURE AHEAD OF THE SYSTEM 
ADVECTS EAST. WHILE THE MOISTURE DEEPENS THROUGH THE DAY...LIFT 
REMAINS VERY WEAK...SO PRECIP WILL BE LIGHT. WILL KEEP POPS IN THE 
CHANCE RANGE TODAY...THEN INCREASE TO CATEGORICAL THROUGH THE 
EVENING. THE BEST LIFT WILL BE ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER DIVERGENCE IN 
THE LEFT EXIT REGION OF THE JET AND LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE WITH THE 
FRONT. THIS OCCURS BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z. 

PRECIP MAY BEGIN AS LIGHT SNOW OR FLURRIES TODAY...BUT NO 
ACCUMULATIONS OVER A HALF INCH ARE EXPECTED AS IT WILL BE LIGHT. AS 
THE STRONGER LIFT MOVES IN TONIGHT...LOW LEVEL TEMPS WILL BE TOO 
WARM FOR THE VALLEY TO GET ANY SNOW. SNOW SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE 
PLATEAU AND SW VA. COLD ADVECTION BEGINS TO LOWER TEMPERATURES AFTER 
06Z...AND PRECIP WILL TRANSITION TO SNOW EVERYWHERE. EXPECT 2 INCHES 
OR LESS BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z...WITH UP TO 3 IN THE TN MOUNTAINS. WILL 
REPLACE THE WATCH AREA WITH AN ADVISORY FOR THE ENTIRE AREA. SINCE THE 
BEST LIFT DOES NOT COME UNTIL AFTER MIDNIGHT...WILL PUSH BACK THE 
START TIME OF THE ADVISORY TO MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKS

FOR MONDAY WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH NEARER THE LOW.  
COULD SEE ANOTHER INCH OR TWO OF SNOW ON MONDAY. THE LOW TRACKS OUT 
OUT OF THE AREA ON MONDAY NIGHT.  KEPT THE HIGHEST POPS FOR THE 
EVENING HOURS. ONLY LIGHT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IS EXPECTED ON MONDAY 
NIGHT. A SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA 
ON TUESDAY.  WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  ANOTHER 
WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA ON WEDNESDAY.  WITH ONLY 
LIMITED MOISTURE WILL KEEP ONLY SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR THE NORTHERN 
AREAS ON WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN AREAS ON THURSDAY. WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE EXPECTED... 
WILL KEEP THURSDAY DRY FOR NOW.  HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY 
WEATHER FOR FRIDAY. A FRONT APPROACHES THE AREA ON SATURDAY. WILL ADD

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LEE TROUGH EXTENDING ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE HIGH 
PLAINS. WITH NORTHWEST FLOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA...AREA RADARS 
REVEAL SOME FLURRIES AND LIGHT SNOW OVER THE NORTHERN TWO-THIRDS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. THUS...WILL CONTINUE WITH A MENTION OF THIS 
THROUGH THE EVENING HOURS. MODELS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THAT THE 
CLIPPER SYSTEM OVER THE PLAINS WILL QUICKLY MOVE SOUTHEAST ACROSS 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON SUNDAY...WITH SOUTHWESTERLY WINDS AHEAD OF 
THIS SYSTEM BRINGING INCREASING MOISTURE AND ISENTROPIC LIFT OVER 
THE FORECAST AREA. INITIAL PRECIP SHOULD DEVELOP BY SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON... BUT IT APPEARS THAT IT WILL BE LIGHT AND MIXED WITH 
RAIN ACROSS THE VALLEY AREAS BELOW 2500 FEET WHERE TEMPS SHOULD RISE 
INTO UPPER 30S TO LOWER 40S. PRECIP WILL LIKELY BEGIN AS SNOW ACROSS 
THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON...WITH AN 
INCH OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS POSSIBLE ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS BEFORE 
SUNSET. AS THE COLD FRONT ASSOCIATED WITH THIS SYSTEM MOVES THROUGH 
THE FORECAST AREA SUNDAY EVENING...EXPECT SNOW TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE 
ENTIRE AREA...ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT AS THE UPPER LOW MOVES 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA INTO MONDAY MORNING. WITH REMAINING IN THE 
30S ACROSS THE SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS SUNDAY NIGHT... 
EXPECT LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS SINCE SNOWFALL SHOULD HAVE A 
TOUGH TIME ACCUMULATING. WITH VERY COLD UPPER-LEVEL TEMPS PROGGED 
WITH THIS UPPER LOW...EXPECT SIGNIFICANT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS 
ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 FEET WHERE A WINTER STORM 
WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT. THIS 
WINTER EVENT WILL TRANSITION FROM A SYNOPTIC-SCALE STRATIFORM SNOW 
EVENT TO AN UPSLOPE EVENT MAINLY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS BY MONDAY 
AFTERNOON. AS FOR TEMPS...MOS GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT 
THROUGH MONDAY NIGHT AND LOOK REASONABLE. HOWEVER...WILL PLAN TO 
UNDERCUT THESE NUMBERS SOMEWHAT WHERE SNOW COVER IS EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...A COUPLE OF WEAK WAVES 
ROTATING AROUND THE UPPER TROUGH WILL MOVE THROUGH TO OUR NORTH AND 
BRING A FEW LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES OVER NORTHERN LOCATIONS 
ON TUESDAY AND WEDNESDAY. WILL BE BETWEEN THINGS ON THURSDAY...THEN 
A WEAK COLD FRONT SLIDES THROUGH LATE FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT. MODEL 
CONSISTENCY POOR AND CONFIDENCE LOW ON DETAILS...WILL INTRODUCE LOW 
POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM SHOULD MOVE THROUGH RATHER 
QUICKLY AND WILL GO DRY ON SATURDAY. WILL CONTINUE TO SEE COOLER... 
BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
WESTERN ATLANTIC OCEAN...WITH A LEE TROUGH EXTENDING ALONG THE 
EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A NORTHWESTERLY 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW WILL CONTINUE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA TODAY... 
PRODUCING SOME UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS IN THE FAVORED AREAS ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VA...EAST TN MOUNTAINS...AND THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU. DOWNSLOPING FLOW INTO THE GREAT TN VALLEY WILL LIKELY KEEP 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUDS OVER THE VALLEY...AND MAY ALSO HELP TO PRODUCE 
SOME ADIABATIC WARMING.

WITH ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS 
MORNING TO RAISE POPS IN THE FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS...AND TO TWEAK 
SKY CONDITIONS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE LATEST TRENDS.

OF ANOTHER SHORTWAVE TROUGH IN THE NORTHERN STREAM. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AREA OF LOW PRESSURE TRACKS 
THROUGH THE REGION ON LATE SUNDAY AND INTO MONDAY. WILL KEEP THE

ACCUMULATE ON SUNDAY NIGHT AND MONDAY...WITH THE HIGHEST SNOWFALL 
TOTALS ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. THE LOW EXITS THE AREA ON 
MONDAY...WILL KEEP CHANCE TO LIKELY POPS FOR MONDAY WITH THE BEST 
CHANCES IN THE NORTH NEARER THE LOW.  A SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON TUESDAY.  WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST

SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE NORTHEASTERN GULF OF 
MEXICO...WITH AN INVERTED TROUGH EXTENDING NORTH OF IT ALONG THE 
EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
THAT THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF ITS ASSOCIATED PRECIP WAS AFFECTING 
SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC...AND WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE THE

ACROSS THE REGION ON SATURDAY. THUS...WILL MENTION A CHANCE FOR SNOW 
SHOWERS ACROSS THE FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS OF SOUTHWEST VA...NORTHEAST 
TN AND THE SMOKY MTNS. 

MODELS REMAIN IN GENERAL AGREEMENT ON SATURDAY NIGHT WITH THE 
DEVELOPMENT OF THE NEXT LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE NORTHERN 
PLAINS. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM SHOULD QUICKLY DIVE SOUTHEAST INTO 
THE TN RIVER VALLEY ON SUNDAY...WITH SOUTHWEST WINDS AHEAD OF THIS 
SYSTEM BRINGING INCREASING MOISTURE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS 
INDICATE SOME ISENTROPIC LIFT AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM PRODUCING SOME 
INITIAL PRECIP BY SUNDAY AFTERNOON...BUT THESE SOUTHWEST WINDS AHEAD 
OF ITS ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT SHOULD ALSO WARM TEMPS INTO THE UPPER 
30S AND LOWER 40S ACROSS THE GREAT TN VALLEY ON SUNDAY AFTERNOON. 
THUS...EXPECT A MIXTURE OF RAIN AND SNOW INITIALLY ON SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON ACROSS VALLEY LOCATIONS BELOW 2500 FEET...ALTHOUGH PRECIP 
WILL LIKELY BEGIN AS SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS ABOVE 2500 
FEET. AS THE COLD FRONT MOVES THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA LATE SUNDAY 
NIGHT...EXPECT SNOW TO DEVELOP ACROSS THE ENTIRE AREA WITH LIGHT

PRECIP WILL BE MOSTLY SNOW THOUGH A RAIN SNOW MIX IS POSSIBLE OVER 
THE SOUTHERN VALLEY IN THE AFTERNOON. ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS 
SHOULD BE LIGHT ON MONDAY WITH LITTLE TO NO ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS 
SOUTH...AND A HALF INCH TO AN INCH POSSIBLE NORTHERN AND EASTERN

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED 
OVER THE NORTH CENTRAL GULF OF MEXICO...WITH A SUB FREEZING AIR MASS 
LINGERING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS ARE NOW INDICATING THAT 
MOISTURE ASSOCIATED WITH THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL AFFECT

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
CYCLOGENESIS IS TAKING PLACE OVER THE WESTERN GULF OF MEXICO THIS 
MORNING. OVERCAST MIDLEVEL CLOUDS ARE MOVING INTO THE AREA AS THE 
SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH APPROACHES. THE TREND OF THE RECENT 
MODEL RUNS HAS BEEN TO SPREAD MOISTURE AND LIFT FARTHER NORTH...AND 
BOTH THE NAM AND GFS BRING PRECIP INTO SOUTHERN PORTIONS OF THE 
AREA. FORCING APPEARS MAINLY ASSOCIATED WITH UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE 
JET ENTRANCE REGION AND WEAK CONVERGENCE WITH THE MIDLEVEL TROUGH. 
THE BEST LIFT STAYS TO OUR SOUTH HOWEVER...WHICH SHOULD KEEP PRECIP 
AMOUNTS FAIRLY LIGHT. WILL HAVE CATEGORICAL POPS IN SW NC THIS 
AFTERNOON...TAPERING TO LIKELY IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND THE 
SMOKIES...TO A CHANCE IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY. WILL ISSUE A WINTER 
WEATHER ADVISORY FOR EXTREME SW NC/SE TN MOUNTAINS AND THE SMOKIES 
FROM NOON TO 10 PM AS AMOUNTS AROUND 2 INCHES LOOK LIKELY. WENT WITH 
THE COLDER MET GUIDANCE FOR TEMPERATURES TODAY AS CLOUD COVER WILL 
BE PLENTIFUL.

ANOTHER ROUND OF LIGHT SNOW MAY FOLLOW TONIGHT WITH THE PASSAGE OF A 
NORTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE TROUGH. MOISTURE WILL BE LIMITED AND LIFT 
WEAK WITH THIS TROUGH PASSAGE...BUT DECENT UPSLOPE FLOW SHOULD GIVE 
A CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE OF MEASURABLE SNOW IN NORTHERN AREAS AFTER 
MIDNIGHT. WILL KEEP ACCUMULATIONS UNDER A HALF INCH WITH THIS 
CLIPPER.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY...HIGH PRESSURE BRINGING DRY 
WEATHER FOR SATURDAY.  A FRONT TRACKS THROUGH THE REGION ON LATE 
SUNDAY AND INTO MONDAY.  WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST POPS ON SUNDAY NIGHT 
WHEN THE DEEPEST MOISTURE ARRIVES.  SHOULD BE COLD ENOUGH FOR SNOW 
ON SUNDAY NIGHT.  THE FRONT EXITS THE AREA ON MONDAY...WILL KEEP 
CHANCE POPS FOR MONDAY WITH THE BEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH NEARER THE 
FRONT.  SNOW IS EXPECTED TO CHANCE TO RAIN IN THE CENTRAL AND 
SOUTHERN VALLEY BY MONDAY AFTERNOON.  A SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE 
NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA ON TUESDAY.  WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST 
CHANCES IN THE NORTH.  ANOTHER WEAKER SHORTWAVE TRACKS THROUGH THE 
AREA ON WEDNESDAY.  WITH ONLY LIMITED MOISTURE EXPECTED WITH 
IT...WILL KEEP WEDNESDAY DRY.  HIGH PRESSURE BRINGING DRY WEATHER 
FOR THURSDAY.  TEMPERATURES REMAIN BELOW NORMAL FOR THE PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAJOR SYSTEM CONTINUES TO SLOWLY 
PULL AWAY FROM THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. SCATTERED GENERALLY 
LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS LEFT IN ITS WAKE CONTINUE TO TRANSLATE THROUGH 
MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. MODELS GENERALLY 
AGREE THAT CYCLONIC FLOW WILL RELAX AND BECOME MORE OR LESS 
ZONAL...BECOMING LESS AND LESS FAVORABLE FOR UPSLOPE OROGRAPHIC LIFT 
PRECIP. THUS ANTICIPATE CURRENT SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY TO DECREASE IN 
COVERAGE AND INTENSITY BY EARLY IN THE FIRST PERIOD. WILL ALLOW 
ALL ADVISORIES AND WARNINGS TO EXPIRE AS SCHEDULED. BALANCE OF SHORT 
TERM DRY ALTHOUGH APPROACHING SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM WILL LIKELY 
PRECLUDE MUCH IN THE WAY OF SIGNIFICANT CLEARING SKY COVER. FOR 
TEMPS...GENERALLY TENDED TO FAVOR COOLER OF GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...FORECAST GRIDS ON TRACK
FOR THESE PERIODS. HPC FAVORING A LITTLE MORE NORTHERN TRACK OF THE
GULF COAST SYSTEM FRIDAY THAN THE GFS...SO NUDGED POPS UP JUST A
BIT ACROSS OUR EXTREME SRN COUNTIES NEAR FFC AND GSP. STILL DON'T
EXPECT MUCH WEATHER FOR OUR REGION FROM THIS SYSTEM...BUT WORTH A
20 TO 30 PERCENT POP ACROSS SE TN AND SW NC...INTO FRIDAY EVENING.

NEXT MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM IS THE SHORTWAVE TROUGH AND ASSOCIATED
COLD FRONT FOR SUNDAY INTO MONDAY. GFS AND ECMWF QUITE SIMILAR AND
PREFERRED SOLUTIONS OVER THE SLOWER NAM. VERY LITTLE IF ANY CHANGES
TO GRIDS NEEDED FOR THIS SYSTEM...AS DAY SHIFT HAD ALREADY PUSHED
POPS UP TO CHANCE FOR THESE PERIODS. I WON'T HIGHLIGHT THIS SYSTEM
MUCH YET...OTHER THAN IN THE HWO PRODUCT...AS THE AIRMASS LOOKS
QUITE COLD (ALL SNOW) AND THE LIGHTER QPF FROM THE GFS LOOKS BETTER
TO ME THAN THE MORE ZEALOUS ECMWF AMOUNTS. 

OTHERWISE...STILL NO HOPE OF GETTING ANYWHERE NEAR SEASONAL NORMS
FOR TEMPS FOR THIS PACKAGE. GFSX MOS TEMPS RELFECT THIS WITH MAX
TEMPS RUNNING AROUND 10 DEGREES OR MORE BELOW CLIMO THROUGH
WEDNESDAY. I DID MAKE A FEW TWEAKS...GENERALLY LOWERING MAX
TEMPS...GIVEN STRENGTH OF COLD AIR ADVECTION BEHIND THE LATE
WEEKEND SYSTEM. HOWEVER...SOME GOOD NEWS AS I WAS ABLE TO KEEP
TUESDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY MOSTLY DRY.

RATES BELOW 850 MB AND A DECENT MID-LEVEL INVERSION ABOVE 850 MB. 
THUS...THESE SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VERTICAL GROWTH 
ABOVE 850 MB...AND THINK THAT THE OVERALL SNOWFALL COVERAGE WILL 
QUICKLY DECREASE TONIGHT AS THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH EXITS THE REGION. 
FORECASTED SNOWFALL AMOUNTS APPEAR TO STILL BE ON TRACK...AND WILL 
PLAN TO CONTINUE THE WINTER WX ADVISORIES/WARNINGS AS PREVIOUSLY 
ADVERTISED. LATEST SURFACE OBS INDICATE THAT WINDS HAVE NOT REALLY 
REACHED ADVISORY CRITERIA IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS BELOW 2500 FEET... 
SO WILL PLAN TO CANCEL THE WIND ADVISORY EVERYWHERE BELOW 2500 FEET. 
UPPER-LEVEL FLOW BECOMES MORE ZONAL ON THURSDAY...WITH SNOW SHOWERS 
GRADUALLY ENDING ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS DURING THE MORNING 
HOURS. ANOTHER LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM IS THEN PROGGED TO DEVELOP ACROSS 
THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO ON THURSDAY...WITH THE MODELS IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT THAT IT WILL TRACK ACROSS GULF COASTAL REGION AND 
REMAIN SOUTH OF THE FORECAST AREA ON FRIDAY. THE NORTHERN FRINGE OF 
ITS ASSOCIATED PRECIP COULD POSSIBLY AFFECT SOUTHEAST TN AND 
SOUTHWEST NC ON FRIDAY...SO WILL CONTINUE WITH SLIGHT CHANCE POPS 
FOR THESE AREAS. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL 
AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD...BUT WILL PLAN TO UNDERCUT THESE 
NUMBERS WHERE SNOW COVER IS OBSERVED.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ECMWF/GFS RELATIVELY CLOSE 
IN DEPICTION OF WEATHER DURING THE PERIOD. HOWEVER...GFS A LITTLE 
SLOWER IN PROGRESSION OF SHORT WAVE FEATURES DURING THE MONDAY 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY TIMEFRAME. WENT A LITTLE CLOSER TO THE ECMWF 
DURING THIS PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. ON SATURDAY PAINTED A SLIGHT 
CHANCE OF FLURRIES OR SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN ACROSS THE 
NORTH AS WELL AS THE LOWER ELEVATIONS OF NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE 
MODELS INDICATE WEAK SHORT WAVE DROPS SOUTHEAST THROUGH THE BASE OF 
NORTHEASTERN U.S. LONG WAVE TROF. NORTHWESTERLY COMPONENT MAY LIMIT 
ANY LIGHT QPF TO THE HIGH TERRAIN REGIONS BUT USED A BROADBRUSH 
APPROACH AT THIS TIME FOR NORTHEAST TENNESSEE DUE TO UNCERTAINTY. 
FORECAST GETS A LITTLE MORE INTERESTING FROM LATER SATURDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH MONDAY AS ATMOSPHERE NOT YET COMPLETE WITH THE REGION AND 
HAS MORE WINTERY WEATHER IN STORE FOR THE FIRST COUPLE DAYS OF NEXT 
WEEK. MODELS INDICATE RATHER HEALTHY UPPER TROF/CLOSED LOW AND 
ASSOCIATED SURFACE FRONTAL SYSTEM WILL PRESS EAST ACROSS THE MID 
SOUTH PRODUCING THE POSSIBILITY OF MIXED PRECIP ACROSS MOST OF THE 
REGION WITH SNOW AT HIGHER ELEVATION SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY. 
PRECIP WOULD MOST LIKELY CHANGE OVER TO SNOW FOR MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY AS UPPER LOW BUILDS EAST 
TOWARD THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AND LOW LEVEL COLD AIR ADVECTION 
STRENGTHENS BEHIND SURFACE SYSTEM. WILL HAVE TO WAIT A COUPLE MORE 
DAYS FOR BETTER FOCUS ON WHAT MAY HAPPEN LATER THIS WEEKEND. WINTER 
WILL BE GOING NO WHERE FAST MONDAY THRU WEDNESDAY AND USED CHANCE 
POPS FOR MONDAY TAPERING BACK TO SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POP FOR SNOW 
SHOWERS WITH EMPHASIS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN FOR MONDAY NIGHT AS 
AMPLIFIED UPPER TROF APPARENTLY NOT IN A HURRY TO EXIT THE EASTERN 
U.S. FINALLY WAS ABLE TO REMOVE POPS EVERYWHERE TUESDAY NIGHT 
THROUGH WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS TROF EXITS INTO THE ATLANTIC WITH THE 
POSSIBILITY OF DRY...ALBEIT COLD ADVECTION FOR THE END OF THE LONG 
TERM FORECAST.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION...UPDATE
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1105 AM EST WED FEB 10 2010

.DISCUSSION...
WILL PLAN TO INCLUDE EXTREME SOUTHEAST TN AND SOUTHWEST NC IN A 
WINTER WX ADVISORY...TO BETTER MATCH THE BLIZZARD WARNING JUST 
ISSUED ACROSS THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE MTNS. WILL NOT UPGRADE THE 
EAST TN MTNS TO A BLIZZARD WARNING...SINCE THE WIND CRITERIA WILL 
LIKELY NOT BE MET ON THE WESTERN SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS. WITH A 
NORTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW...THINK THAT THE STRONGEST WINDS WILL REMAIN 
ON THE EASTERN SIDE OF THE MOUNTAINS DUE TO MOUNTAIN WAVES AND 
DOWNSLOPE ENHANCEMENT.

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A STRONG LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM OVER THE 
MID ATLANTIC STATES...WITH A LEE TROUGH EXTENDING ALONG THE EASTERN 
FOOTHILLS OF THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A CUT-OFF UPPER-LEVEL LOW 
OVER VIRGINIA WILL CONTINUE TO PRODUCE A NORTHWESTERLY WIND FLOW 
ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS AFTERNOON. MODEL SOUNDINGS REVEAL A 
SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE AROUND 850 MB...WITH STEEP LOW-LEVEL LAPSE 
RATES BELOW 850 MB BUT A DECENT MID-LEVEL INVERSION ABOVE 850 MB. 
WHILE AFTERNOON HEATING WILL LIKELY GENERATE SOME WEAK INSTABILITY 
AND ADDITIONAL SNOW SHOWERS...THINK THAT THESE AFTERNOON SNOW 
SHOWERS SHOULD NOT HAVE TOO MUCH VERTICAL GROWTH ABOVE 850 MB. 
THUS...WILL PLAN TO CONTINUE WITH THE CURRENT FORECASTED SNOWFALL 
AMOUNTS AND WILL EMPHASIZE THAT THE HIGHER AMOUNTS WILL MAINLY BE 
CONFINED TO THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. NORTHWESTERLY WINDS AND THEIR 
RESULTING UPSLOPE SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD CONTINUE UNTIL AFTER SUNSET... 
WHEN THE SNOW AND WINDS SHOULD GRADUALLY DIMINISH WITH THE LOSS OF 
SOLAR HEATING AND THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH EXITING THE REGION. WITH 
ALL OF THIS IN MIND...WILL PLAN TO LENGTHEN THE VALID TIMES OF THE 
ADVISORIES UNTIL 7 PM THIS EVENING.

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS MORNING TO LOWER MAX 
TEMPS FOR THIS AFTERNOON...AND TO RAISE POPS IN THE ADVISORY AND

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
319 AM EST WED FEB 10 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...VIGOROUS UPPER LOW WILL CONTINUE 
TO PROGRESS EASTWARD THROUGH THE SHORT TERM. UPSLOPE FLOW 
STRENGTHENS AND BECOMES EVEN MORE FAVORABLE WITH RESPECT TO WIND 
DIRECTION DURING THE FIRST PERIOD. MODELS ALSO PROJECT LOW-LEVEL 
MOISTURE WILL BE BRIEFLY ENHANCED FROM TRAJECTORY FROM WESTERN GREAT 
LAKES REGION...MAINLY LAKE MICHIGAN. THESE FACTORS ALONG WITH GOOD 
LIFT AND SOME LOW-LEVEL CAPE FAVOR CONTINUATION AND EVEN INCREASE IN 
SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY ESPECIALLY IN THE FAVORED UPSLOPE FLOW 
LOCATIONS AND OVER OUR FAR NORTHEASTERN ZONES THROUGH AT LEAST A 
PORTION OF THE FIRST PERIOD. THUS WILL CONTINUE WINTER WEATHER 
PRODUCTS AS CURRENTLY CONFIGURED. WILL ALSO CONTINUE WIND ADVISORY 
AS STRONG FLOW CONTINUES BEHIND DEPARTING SYSTEM. SYSTEM LOSES ITS 
EFFECTS ON REGION BY LATE IN THE SECOND PERIOD. FOR TEMPS... 
GENERALLY FAVORED A BLEND OF THE GUIDANCE VALUES IN THE FIRST PERIOD 
WHILE GENERALLY FAVORED MAV GUIDANCE VALUES IN THE SECOND PERIOD.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...FORECAST GRIDS GENERALLY
ON TRACK FOR THESE PERIODS...LINED UP QUITE WELL WITH ECMWF AND
NEIGHBORING OFFICES GRIDS. NOT MUCH MORE THAN ISOLATED SNOW
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES FOR EXTREME NE AREAS ON THURSDAY...THEN LOOK
FOR A SRN STREAM SYSTEM TO TRACK ACROSS THE GULF COAST STATES AND
POSSIBLY BRUSH SE TN AND SW NC. THIS IS ALL QUITE CONSISTENT WITH
PREVIOUS GRIDS...SO LITTLE CHANGES WERE MADE.

ECMWF AND GFS DEVELOP A STRONG NRN STREAM SHORTWAVE AND ASSOCIATED
COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY...WITH ECMWF A BIT FASTER IN SWEEPING THIS
SYSTEM ACROSS THE SRN APPALACHIANS ON SUNDAY NIGHT. TYPICALLY WOULD
EXPECT A FEW SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES ON THE BACK SIDE OF A SYSTEM
SUCH AS THIS...AND FORECAST GRIDS WERE ALREADY TRENDED THAT WAY FOR
MONDAY. HOWEVER...PER COORDINATION I DID BUMP POPS UP ON SUNDAY
DAYTIME TO CHANCE ACROSS NRN AREAS...AND WILL ALLOW DAY SHIFT TO
LOOK INTO INCREASING POPS MORE IF NEEDED.

OTHERWISE...CONTINUED A DRY FORECAST FOR MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY.
UNDERCUTTING MOS GUIDANCE FOR HIGHS THURSDAY LOOKED GOOD...SINCE WE
EXPECT SOME SNOW ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS SW VA/NE TN/SMOKY MTNS. ALSO
...FAVORED TRENDING BELOW MOS FOR OTHER DAYS GIVEN LOW LEVEL FLOW
AND 850 MB TEMPS. THUS...NOT MUCH HOPE OF GETTING NEAR SEASONAL
NORMAL TEMPS FOR THIS WEEK.

842 PM EST TUE FEB 9 2010

.DISCUSSION...
A COLD FRONT HAS MOVED THROUGH THE AREA...AND TEMPERATURES HAVE
BEEN PLUMMETING WHILE WINDS HAVE BEEN INCREASING. 00Z OHX SOUNDING
SHOWS A THIN LAYER OF MOISTURE AROUND 850 MB...BUT WITH STEEP LOW
LEVEL LAPSE RATES...SNOW SHOWERS HAVE DEVELOPED. FARTHER
WEST...SATELLITE IMAGERY SHOWS CLEARING SKIES...SO THERE LOOKS TO
BE A DRY PERIOD BEFORE ADDITIONAL SNOW SHOWERS RETURN AROUND
DAYBREAK. 

OVERALL...THE CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS GOOD...AND NO CHANGES ARE
PLANNED TO THE CURRENT WARNINGS AND ADVISORIES. ONLY SILGHT CHANGES
WILL BE MADE TO ADJUST FOR CURRENT TEMPERATURE TRENDS AND TO CLOUD
COVER TO ACCOUNT FOR THE CLEARING UPSTREAM. WE WILL BE VERY CLOSE
TO MEETING WIND CHILL CRITERIA TONIGHT IN THE MOUNTAINS...BUT THIS
SHOULD BE ONLY IN THE HIGHEST PEAKS AND NOT WIDESPREAD...SO WILL
NOT ISSUE ANY WIND CHILL ADVISORIES.

WITH THE STRONG WINDS AND OCCASSIONALLY HEAVY SNOW
SHOWERS...BLIZZARD CONDITIONS APPEAR LIKELY AT TIMES TOMORROW. BUT
VISIBILITIES <1/4 MILE SHOULD BE CONFINED TO THE HEAVIEST SNOW
SHOWERS...AND THUS SHOULD NOT BE CONTINUOUS FOR MORE THAN ONE HOUR. A
BLIZZARD WARNING WAS CONSIDERED...BUT INSTEAD WILL BEEF UP THE
WORDING OF THE WINTER STORM WARNING TO MENTION LOWERED VISIBILITIES
WITH THE HEAVIER SHOWERS AND BLOWING/DRIFTING SNOW.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
325 AM EST TUE FEB 9 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...ACTIVE WINTER WEATHER
PATTERN PERSISTS FOR THESE PERIODS. I CONTINUED CURRENT WINTER
WEATHER ADVISORY FOR SW VA/NRN MTNS/SMOKY MTNS FOR TODAY...ALTHO
LATEST SURFACE TEMPS AND RUC MODEL TEMPS INDICATE JUST A CHANCE FOR
SOME WINTRY MIX IN THE ADVISORY AREA. IF RUC AND NAM MODELS ARE
CORRECT IN WARMING THE LOW LEVELS AND 850 TEMPS THIS MORNING...
THEN DAY SHIFT MAY BE ABLE TO CANCEL THIS ADVISORY EARLY. 
SENSIBLE FORECAST IS FOR BULK OF THE AREA TO JUST GET RAIN TODAY.

THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM AND ASSOCIATED SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL PASS
THROUGH THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON...WITH A BRIEF BREAK IN THE
PRECIPITATION (PCPN). THEN AN EXTENDED PERIOD OF SNOW SHOWERS OR
FLURRIES WILL DEVELOP THIS EVENING AND CONTINUE INTO WEDNESDAY
AFTERNOON. THE MAIN CAUSE FOR THIS WILL BE STRONG COLD AIR ADVECTION
...UPPER LEVEL SHORTWAVE ENERGY PASSING ACROSS THE REGION...AND
WHAT WOULD APPEAR TO BE A DECENT NW LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW PATTERN. 
NAM MODEL INDICATES SURFACE BASED CAPES OF 30 TO 60 J/KG LATE
TUESDAY NIGHT INTO WEDNESDAY...WITH A GOOD NW COMPONENT AND STRONG
WIND SPEEDS FROM SURFACE TO 850 MBS. 

THE TIGHT SURFACE GRADIENT AND STRENGTH OF LOW LEVEL JET HAS
PROMPTED A HIGH WIND WATCH FOR THE NRN AND SMOKY MTNS...AND A 
WIND ADVISORY FOR SW VA...BOTH IN EFFECT FROM LATE THIS EVENING
INTO EARLY THURSDAY MORNING. THANKS TO SURROUNDING NWS OFFICES FOR
COORDINATION ON THESE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORIES AND WIND PRODUCTS.

OTHERWISE...MOS BLEND ON TEMPS FOR TODAY AND TONIGHT LOOKED
REASONABLE...AND THEN I FAVORED THE COLDER GUIDANCE (NAM) FOR MAX
TEMPS WEDNESDAY. NUDGED POPS UP A BIT TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY IN THE
ADVISORY AREAS...WHERE UPSLOPE FLOW IS A FACTOR.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...LONG WAVE TROUGH 
WILL MORE OR LESS PERSIST FOR THE FORESEEABLE FUTURE OVER THE 
EASTERN CONUS. AS A RESULT...REGION WILL REMAIN IN NEGATIVE HEIGHT 
ANOMALY REGIME WHICH PORTENDS TEMPS GENERALLY REMAINING BELOW TO 
WELL BELOW CLIMO. PERIODIC SHORT WAVES ARE PROJECTED TO TRANSLATE 
THROUGH THE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW OF THE EASTERN CONUS LONG WAVE TROUGH. 
SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM ON FRIDAY STILL PROJECTED TO REMAIN SOUTH OF 
OUR FORECAST AREA...BUT A FEW GEFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS INDICATE SOME 
LIGHT PRECIP MAY SLIP INTO OUR SOUTHERN TIER. REMAINDER OF LONG TERM 
INHERENTLY LOW CONFIDENCE AS DETAILS REMAIN MURKY. THUS HAVE NOT 
MADE ANY SUBSTANTIVE CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS.

BUT TOO LIGHT TO MEASURE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH MONDAY)...SURFACE AND UPPER RIDGE SHOULD

LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...GFS/ECMWF FASTER THAN 
NAM/SREF WITH NEXT SYSTEM AND THE SPREADING IN OF PRECIPITATION 
MONDAY NIGHT AND TUESDAY. CLOUD COVER WILL LIMIT TEMPERATURE DROP 
WITH COLDEST TEMPERATURES NORTHEAST. MOSTLY RAIN LOWER ELEVATIONS 
MONDAY NIGHT WITH SNOW POSSIBLY NORTHEAST. RAIN AND SNOW TUESDAY 
MORNING BUT EXPECT PRECIPITATION TO BE MOSTLY RAIN TUESDAY. LIGHT 
ACCUMULATIONS TUESDAY MORNING. RIGHT NOW THINKING IS ONLY A COUPLE 
INCHES MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA. 
COLDER AIR MOVES IN TUESDAY NIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. UNCERTAINTY ON HOW 
FAR SOUTH SIGNIFICANT SHORTWAVE ENERGY MAKES IT INTO THE FORECAST

EXCEPT HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF NORTHEAST TN. BEST PRECIPITATION CHANCES

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...MAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO FORECAST 
GRIDS WERE TO DELAY THE CHANGEOVER TO WINTRY PRECIPITATION 
(PCPN)...AS 08Z TEMPS STILL GENERALLY TOO WARM FOR SNOW...EXCEPT FOR 
A FEW SPOTS SUCH AS VJI (ABINGDON). COLD AIR ADVECTION IS WORKING 
EAST FROM MIDDLE TN...AND FORECAST SOUNDINGS INDICATE MOSTLY SNOW 
FROM ABOUT 15Z TODAY ON. HOWEVER...AMOUNTS FROM PREVIOUS GRIDS STILL 
APPEAR ON TRACK WITH A REDUCTION IN PRE-12Z SNOW AMOUNT GRIDS DUE TO 
LATE CHANGEOVER. UPPER LOW/TROUGH WILL SEND A DECENT SHOT OF 
VORTICITY ACROSS THE REGION THIS MORNING...WITH STRONG COLD AIR 
ADVECTION...BUT STILL NOT A STRONG LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW. 
THUS...KEPT WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY AS BEFORE...BOTH IN AREA/TIME 
AND SNOW AMOUNTS. 

DON'T EXPECT MUCH SIGNIFICANT SNOW FOR TONIGHT...BUT DID KEEP POPS A 
LITTLE ABOVE MOS POPS. MAX TEMPS TODAY WILL OCCUR VERY EARLY...AND 
MINS TONIGHT WERE ADJUSTED SLIGHTLY UPWARD IN LINE WITH 00Z MOS 
(WHICH SEEMED REASONABLE GIVEN LINGERING CLOUDS).

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...SHORT RANGE MODELS BRING WEAK 
HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL ACROSS FORECAST AREA SUNDAY WITH CLEARING 
SKIES AND STILL COOL TEMPERATURES MAINLY UPPER 30S TO MID 40S. 
SUNDAY NIGHT COOLER NORTHEAST WITH SKIES PARTLY CLOUDY. ELSEWHERE

423 AM EST FRI FEB 5 2010

.SHORT TERM...TODAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...LARGE AREA OF MOSTLY RAIN 
CONTINUES TO MOVE NORTHEAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA THIS MORNING.
AVAILABLE SURFACE OBSERVATIONS AND A FEW PHONE CALLS...WOULD LIMIT 
ANY WINTRY MIX TO MAINLY PARTS OF RUSSELL AND WASHINGTON COUNTIES OF 
VA...AND ALSO PARTS OF JOHNSON AND CARTER COUNTIES OF NE TN. THESE 
AREAS MAY STILL HAVE A FEW SPOTS NEAR OR JUST BELOW 32 DEGREES WITH 
850 TEMPS JUST BELOW FREEZING. JOHNSON COUNTY TN WAS ONLY LOCATION 
GETTING ANY SNOW OR ICE PER CALLS. AFTER COORDINATION WITH 
NEIGHBORING NWS OFFICES...HAVE OPTED TO REMOVE LEE COUNTY VA FROM 
THE CURRENT WINTER WX ADVISORY AND ALSO END THE ADVISORY AT 10 AM 
EST TODAY. DOWNPLAYED SNOW AND ICE AMOUNTS SOME IN UPDATED FORECAST 
GRIDS AND ADVISORY. MODELS SHOW SUFFICIENT LOW LEVEL WARMING TO 
SUPPORT THIS DECISION AS PRECIPITATION (PCPN) SHOULD BE COMPLETELY 
RAIN AFTER MID MORNING.

OTHERWISE...WILL KEEP WIND ADVISORY AS ISSUED EARLIER...AS SURFACE 
GRADIENT REMAINS TIGHT INTO THE AFTERNOON AND MODELS SHOW LOW LEVEL 
JET OF AROUND 45 KNOTS. 

MODELS IN FAIR AGREEMENT ON PCPN TRANSITIONING BACK TO SNOW EARLY 
TONIGHT...ON BACK SIDE OF EXITING LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM. I ALSO PREFER 
MODELS THAT SHOW LINGERING SHORTWAVE ENERGY AND A VERY SLIGHT AMOUNT 
OF LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE FLOW WELL INTO SATURDAY. THUS...NUDGED POPS UP 
FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY...AS PERIODS OF SNOW OR SNOW SHOWERS 
CONTINUE. HAVE ISSUED A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR FAVORED AREAS 
FOR TONIGHT AND SATURDAY. THOUGHT ABOUT A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR A 
FEW AREAS...BUT THIS DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE A STRONG NW UPSLOPE FLOW 
EVENT AT THIS TIME...SO KEPT SNOW AMOUNTS IN THE ADVISORY RANGE. 

SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT HIGHS TODAY AND ALSO FAVORED THE COOLER MOS FOR 
SATURDAY MAXES. 

.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...SATURDAY NIGHT
PRECIPITATION ENDS FAIRLY QUICKLY AS LOW PRESSURE AREA MOVES
NORTHEAST OUT INTO THE ATLANTIC. TEMPERATURES DROP INTO THE 20S.
FORECASTED LOWS SLIGHTLY BELOW GUIDANCE. SUNDAY THROUGH MONDAY HIGH
PRESSURE BUILDS IN FROM THE WEST. KEPT TEMPERATURES BELOW GUIDANCE
SUNDAY AS COLD AIR ADVECTION CONTINUES WITH CLOUDS SLOWLY DECREASING.
SUNDAY NIGHT LOOKS CONTINUED COLD AS HIGH MOVES OVERHEAD AND SKIES
MOSTLY CLEAR. MONDAY SLIGHTLY WARMER AS HIGH SHIFTS EAST. MONDAY
NIGHT CLOUDS INCREASE AS NEW SYSTEM APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. THIS
SYSTEM IS WARM ENOUGH FOR MOSTLY RAIN TUESDAY THEN CHANGING TO SNOW
TUESDAY NIGHT BUT TEMPERATURES DO NOT DROP UNTIL MOST OF THE
MOISTURE MOVES OUT. WEDNESDAY HIGH PRESSURE MOVES INTO THE FORECAST
AREA AND CONTINUES DRY THROUGH THURSDAY.

.DISCUSSION...NO CHANGES. FORECAST APPEARS GENERALLY ON TRACK AS
SIGNIFICANT SOUTHERN STREAM SYSTEM CONTINUES TO APPROACH THE
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION FROM THE SOUTHWEST. RADAR MOSAIC SHOWS
PRECIP RETURNS NEARING CHA AT THIS TIME. HOWEVER...MODEL TIME
HEIGHTS DEPICT QUITE DEEP LAYER OF DRY AIR IN THE LOWER AND MID
LEVELS. THUS ANTICIPATE IT WILL TAKE SOME TIME TO OVERCOME THIS DRY
LAYER AND ALLOW PRECIP TO REACH GROUND. DOWNSLOPE FLOW SHOULD ALSO
INHIBIT PRECIP INITIALLY IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN VALLEYS.
TIMING OF PRECIP PROGRESSION IN CURRENT FORECAST LOOKS REASONABLE
GIVEN THIS SCENARIO. TEMPS ALSO LOOK REASONABLE BASED ON CURRENT
TRENDS AND LATEST MAV/LAV GUIDANCE. NO CHANGES WARRANTED AT THIS
TIME.

CURRENTLY LIGHT WITH HIGHER PRESSURE OVER THE MS VALLEY WHICH WILL 
WORK ITS WAY INTO THE FORECAST AREA LATE TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY. THE 
DRIER AIR WILL MAKE FOR A MOSTLY SUNNY DAY WEDNESDAY. LOW LEVEL 
MOISTURE AND LIGHT WINDS TONIGHT WILL ALLOW FOG TO CONTINUE AND MAY

SHOWERS ESPECIALLY AFTER MIDNIGHT ACROSS THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. 

LIMITING FACTOR MAY BE PRECIPITABLE WATER AND AMOUNT OF MOISTURE
AVAILABLE. FORECAST SOUNDS INDICATE THAT PWAT VALUES DO DECREASE
FROM AROUND AN INCH TO A HALF OF AN INCH BY 06Z SATURDAY. DO FEEL
THAT WHAT MOISTURE IS IN THE ATMOSPHERE WILL BE ENOUGH TO PRODUCE
SNOW SHOWERS AND WILL CONTINUE TO MONITOR AMOUNTS. LATER PACKAGES
MAY HAVE TO DEAL WITH SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS...BUT STILL A LITTLE
TOO EARLY TO TELL INVOLVING TIMING OF COLD AIR INTRUDING SOUTHEAST
INTO THE AREA AS UPPER TROUGH SWINGS THROUGH AND AVAILABLE LEFT
OVER MOISTURE. STAY TUNED. 

HAVE UPPED POPS SOME FOR SATURDAY WITH UPPER TROUGH SWINGING
THROUGH THE TENNESSEE VALLEY REGION. PROGRESSIVE UPPER FLOW WILL
RESULT IN A BRIEF TIME FRAME OF UPPER RIDGING ON SUNDAY AND INTO
MONDAY. NEXT UPPER LOW AND TROUGH WILL PUSH EAST THROUGH THE UPPER
PLAINS STATES TO THE SOUTHERN GREAT LAKES REGION BY 12Z TUESDAY.
TIMING WITH THIS SYSTEM IS MORE DIFFICULT AT THIS POINT...AND HAVE
DECIDED AT THIS TIME TO GO ALONG WITH THE SLOWER ECMWF MODEL AT
THIS TIME. HAVE INTRODUCED CHANCE POPS FOR FA FOR -RA/-SN SHOWERS
FOR TUESDAY...AS TEMPS COULD BE WARM ENOUGH FOR JUST RAIN
INITIALLY...BUT EXPECTED COLD ADVECTION LATER IN THE DAY COULD
RESULT IN MIXTURE. 

WILL GO A LITTLE LOWER THAN GFS NUMBERS AT THIS TIME FOR EXTENDED
PACKAGE.

STILL TOO DRY IN THE LOW LEVELS FOR ANY PRECIPITATION TO REACH THE 
GROUND. SO CURRENT AFTER MIDNIGHT TIMING STILL LOOKS GOOD.  CLOUDS 
INCREASING ACROSS THE CWA SHOULD HELP SLOW DOWN TEMPERATURES 
FALLING. BUT CURRENT ADVISORY AREAS STILL LOOKS GOOD.  NOT PLANNING 
TO EXPAND THE ADVISORY AREA. PRECIPITATION TYPE AND POPS STILL 
LOOKS.  TEMPERATURES AND THE REST OF THE FORECAST ON TRACK.  NO 
CHANGES NEEDED.  

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...  

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE IS SHIFTING TO THE EAST THIS AFTERNOON. A LOW
PRESSURE WILL MOVE FROM NE FROM NEAR FLORIDA INTO THE ATLANTIC
OCEAN TONIGHT/TUESDAY. MOISTURE IS MOVING NORTH INTO THE SOUTHEAST AND
WILL BRING LIGHT RAIN AND SNOW INTO THE FORECAST AREA. TEMPERATURES
THIS AFTERNOON ARE IN THE 40S WITH A FEW SPOTS IN THE LOWER 50S
SOUTH. HAVE RAISED POPS TO LIKELY NORTHEAST AND MOUNTAINS. PRECIP
TYPE IS RAIN WITH SNOW EARLY AND NORTH MIXED IN AS TEMPERATURES FALL
FAIRLY RAPIDLY EARLY TONIGHT. FREEZING RAIN LOOKS LIKELY IN THE
VALLEY AREAS OF THE NORTHEAST WITH SNOW OR FREEZING RAIN HIGHEST
MOUNTAIN AREAS. QPF AMOUNTS LOOK TO BE AROUND ONE TENTH OR LESS.
THIS COULD STILL CAUSE TRAVEL PROBLEMS IN THE NORTHEAST AREAS.
WENT ON THE COOL SIDE FOR HIGHS TUESDAY AROUND 40 NORTH AND HIGHER
ELEVATIONS TO ABOUT 50 SOUTH. WILL ISSUE ZONES AND WSW SHORTLY. 

.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
MODELS CONSISTENT IN INITIALLY HAVING TENNESSEE VALLEY IN RIDGING
PATTERN AT LOWER THROUGH UPPER LEVELS BY EARLY WEDNESDAY. WITH MORE
MODERATING PACIFIC AIR MOVING THROUGH THE AREA...WILL GO CLOSE TO

TEMPS ARE CONCERNED. PROGRESSIVE UPPER AIR PATTERN AND SOUTHERN

NEXT STORM SYSTEM TO AFFECT THE REGION WILL BE SYSTEM MOVING
THROUGH FAR SOUTHWEST U.S. BY THURSDAY...WITH GULF MOISTURE OPENING
UP AND PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEAST TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA BY 00Z
FRIDAY. LEANING TOWARD ECMWF/HPC WITH NEXT SYSTEM INVOLVING TIMING

NOT CONFIDENT ENOUGH AT THIS TIME TO MAKE MUCH IN WAY OF CHANGES

RUN OR TWO TO SEE SOME CONSISTENCY BEFORE REALLY MAKING MANY
CHANGES TO EXTENDED PORTION OF FORECAST. FORECAST SOUNDINGS AND
BUFKIT DATA MAINTAIN COLD TEMPS AT OR BELOW ZERO CELSIUS IN TRI
CITIES AREA AND SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA FOR FRIDAY AND INTO SATURDAY. 

MODELS CONTINUE TO DEPICT SURFACE LOW MOVING OUT OF SOUTH TEXAS BY
12Z THURSDAY TO THE NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO BY 12Z FRIDAY. DO
EXPECT ISENTROPIC LIFT STRENGTHENING DURING THE DAY BY FRIDAY
ACROSS THE AREA. WILL CONTINUE BASED UPON FORECAST SOUNDINGS FROM
GFS/NAM FOR MIXED PRECIP AT THIS TIME FOR THURSDAY NIGHT PRIOR TO
STRONGER WARM ADVECTION DEVELOPING BY FRIDAY AFTERNOON.

MODELS ARE SIMILAR IN PUSHING SURFACE LOW NORTHEAST TO NEAR CAPE 
HATTERAS NORTH CAROLINA BY 12Z SATURDAY...WITH INVERTED TROUGH SPREADING 
BACK TO THE WEST ACROSS THE APPALACHIANS TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA.

WILL CONTINUE WITH NEAR AND LIKELY CHANCE POPS FORECAST AREA WIDE

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE WILL MOVE OFF TO

COAST INTO ATLANTIC OCEAN TONIGHT/TUESDAY...AS SHORT WAVE ENERGY 
MOVES ACROSS OUR AREA.  THIS WILL PULL SOME MOISTURE NORTH INTO OUR 
AREA...AND MAY BRING SOME LIGHT PRECIPITATION.  UNCERTAINTY IS HIGH 
WITH DETAILS OF THIS SYSTEM...AS MODEL CONTINUITY AND AGREEMENT IS 
GENERALLY LACKING.  WILL GENERALLY GO WITH HPC AND FAVOR SREF 
SOLUTION...WHICH IS DRIER THAN 00Z NAM OR GFS.  THUS WILL TREND POPS 
UP...BUT WILL KEEP THEM NO HIGHER THAN CHANCE...WITH HIGHEST POPS 
OVER THE EASTERN MOUNTAINS.  PRECIP TYPE IS PROBLEMATIC AS WELL.  
TEMPS SHOULD FALL FAIRLY RAPIDLY EARLY TONIGHT...THEN MAY SEE SOME 
RISE LATE.  THERMAL PROFILES SUGGEST MAINLY RAIN/FREEZING RAIN 
DEPENDING ON SURFACE TEMPS...ALTHOUGH SLEET AND SNOW CANNOT BE RULED 
OUT...ESPECIALLY NORTHWEST ZONES AND HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF MOUNTAINS. 
THIS SITUATION CERTAINLY BEARS WATCHING EVEN THOUGH QPF AMOUNTS 
SHOULD BE LIGHT...GIVEN POSSIBILITY OF FREEZING RAIN.  BEST CHANCES 
FOR ANY FREEZING RAIN APPEAR TO BE IN THE NORTHEAST ZONES.  WILL 
ISSUE SPS FOR THIS POTENTIAL WINTRY PRECIP.  WILL UNDERCUT SOME MAV 
TEMPS SLIGHTLY...BUT WILL NOT STRAY FAR OVERALL.    

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...ECMWF/GFS RELATIVELY 
CLOSE IN DEPICTION OF LONG TERM PERIOD. EARLY WEEK SHORT WAVE MAKES 
ITS EXIT TUESDAY NIGHT AS SURFACE THROUGH UPPER LEVEL RIDGE BUILDS

LOW CHANCE POPS FOR SOUTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA ON THURSDAY 
AS UPPER TROF AMPLIFIES ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS. ALSO ADJUSTED  
POPS HIGHER FOR THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY WITH MODEL DEPICTION OF 
DEEPENING NORTHERN GULF OF MEXICO SURFACE LOW TAKING EAST NORTHEAST 
TRACK INTO THE DEEP SOUTH WITH DYNAMIC AND ISENTROPIC LIFT 
STRENGTHENING DURING THE DAY. MIXED PRECIP MAY OCCUR THURSDAY NIGHT 
PRIOR TO STRONGER WAA DEVELOPING ON FRIDAY. SURFACE LOW CONTINUES TO 
DEEPEN AS IT SHIFTS JUST OFF THE CAROLINA COAST FRIDAY NIGHT. 
INVERTED SURFACE TROF EXTENDS BACK ACROSS THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS 
WHILE ADDITIONAL UPPER LEVEL ENERGY DRIVES EAST FROM THE MID 
MISSISSIPPI VALLEY ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY. THEREFORE HELD ONTO 
MEDIUM AND HIGH CHANCE POPS FRIDAY NIGHT AS COLDER AIR SPILLS IN

IDEA OF KEEPING POPS GOING SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY AS MODELS SHOW 
ENERGETIC NORTHWEST FLOW WITH SOME SNOW SHOWERS IN THE HIGHER 
TERRAIN AND RAIN OR SNOW IN THE LOWER ELEVATIONS...WITH THE FROZEN

SPS GOING.

.PREVIOUS DISCUSSION...

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE AREA TONIGHT WILL PROVIDE CLEAR SKIES AND
CALM WINDS. WITH SNOW COVER ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA...TEMPERATURES
WILL FALL QUICKLY WITH SUNSET...INTO THE TEENS JUST ABOUT
EVERYWHERE. WILL HAVE LOW TEMPS TONIGHT A FEW DEGREES BELOW MOS
GUIDANCE. WITH MELTING SNOW KEEPING THE ROADS WET AND RE- FREEZING
TONIGHT...BLACK ICE APPEARS LIKELY. WILL ISSUE AN SPS FOR THIS.

ON MONDAY THE UPPER RIDGE AXIS MOVES ACROSS THE AREA...AND A 300 MB 
JET STEAK NEAR THE TX COAST MOVES NORTHEAST. THIS SHOULD BRING 
INCREASING HIGH CLOUDS TO THE AREA LATE IN THE DAY. WITH CONTINUED 
SNOW COVER...WENT ON THE COOLER SIDE OF THE MOS GUIDANCE...AND A FEW 
DEGREES BELOW IN THE NORTH. 

.LONG TERM...(MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...
SHORT RANGE MODELS DEVELOP LOW PRESSURE OFF FLORIDAS GULF COAST
MONDAY NIGHT AND ACROSS FLORIDA TUESDAY MORNING. THIS SYSTEM IS
PULLED NORTHEAST OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST BY WEDNESDAY MORNING.

CLOUDS ARE HANGING ONTO THE EASTERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA A BIT

COMES AROUND THURSDAY AND DOEST NOT REALLY EXIT UNTIL SATURDAY. 
ADJUSTED POPS TO ACCOUNT FOR MOVEMENT OF SYSTEM THROUGH AREA, AND 
RAISED A HAIR BUT KEPT THEM IN THE CHANGE CATEGORY THIS FAR OUT. 
HOPEFULLY WITH TEMPS ON THE WARM SOME OF THE SNOW PACK WILL MELT OR 
SUBLIMATE AND THE RAIN NEXT WEEK WILL NOT CAUSE FLOODING. HOWEVER

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
344 AM EST SAT JAN 30 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...HAVE HAD A MIXED BAG OF PRECIP 
OVER MUCH OF THE AREA...WITH MAINLY SNOW NORTH...AND FREEZING 
RAIN/SLEET/SNOW FURTHER SOUTH.  SOME AREAS FAR SOUTH HAVE BEEN PLAIN 
RAIN AT TIMES.  SNOW HAS BEEN HEAVY AT TIMES...AND SIGNIFICANT 
ACCUMULATIONS HAVE OCCURRED.  OF COURSE THE MIXED PRECIP HAS LIMITED 
SNOW ACCUMULATIONS TO LOWER VALUES THAN EXPECTED OVER AT LEAST 
CENTRAL AREAS...AND WHERE RAIN/FREEZING RAIN HAS OCCURRED THE SNOW 
HAS COMPACTED SO GETTING ACCURATE MAX SNOW DEPTHS WILL BE 
DIFFICULT.  MIXED PRECIP SHOULD CONTINUE INTO TODAY...WITH PRECIP 
INTENSITIES BECOMING LIGHT. TEMPS SHOULD NOT RISE MUCH...AND MAY
FALL A BIT THIS AFTERNOON. SHOULD SEE A TRANSITION TO MORE SNOW AS
THE DAY PROGRESSES. ALTHOUGH THE BULK OF THE PRECIP WILL BE DONE BY
MORNING...WILL KEEP WINTER STORM WARNINGS UP FOR NOW GIVEN
POSSIBILITY OF SOME ICE ACCUMULATION ALONG WITH THE SNOW. ANY
LINGERING PRECIP SHOULD END THIS EVENING...AND SKY SHOULD BEGIN TO
CLEAR AFTER MIDNIGHT.

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...AS THIS PART OF THE FORECAST 
BEGINS...THE UPPER TROF IS EXITING TO THE NE...AS A SHORT-WAVE RIDGE 
BUILDS IN.  HOWEVER...RIDGE SWEEPS RIGHT THRU AND NEXT SYSTEM IS 
ALREADY MOVING IN BY TUESDAY...THEN ANOTHER ONE FOR THURSDAY 
AND FRIDAY.  

DETAILS...FOR SUNDAY LOOKS LIKE SUBSIDENCE HAS ERODED LOTS OF 
MOISTURE OUT OF THE AREA...SO EVEN THOUGH UPSLOPE WIND WILL STILL BE 
OCCURRING INTO MOUNTAINS...LOOKS TOO DRY FOR ANY ADDITIONAL SNOW OR 
FLURRIES. WILL KEEP SOME ADDED CLOUDS THERE OVER THE MOUNTAINS FOR 
THE MORNING.  FOR TEMPS WILL GO BELOW GUIDANCE ON HIGH TEMPS FOR 
BOTH SUNDAY AND MONDAY...FIGURING SNOW/SLEET COVER AND/OR WET GROUND 
WILL SUPPRESS HEATING.

GFS SEEMS TO BE ODD-ONE OUT ON HIGHER POPS FOR TUESDAY AS MOST 
MODELS KEEP PRECIP CLOSER TO CORE OF SYSTEM TO SE. WILL PUT IN LIGHT 
POPS IN SE ZONES...AND TAPER OFF TO NW.  

FOR SYSTEM ON THURSDAY AND FRIDAY...FAIRLY COOL AIR MASS IN 
PLACE...WILL PROBABLY HAVE SOME OF THE PRECIP IN THE FORM OF SNOW OR 
FLURRIES IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AND NORTHEAST PART OF CWA AS 
WELL...AND POSSIBLY FARTHER SOUTH...WILL NEED TO WATCH AS IT GETS 
CLOSER.

300 PM EST FRI JAN 29 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)
THE MAJOR SNOW EVENT IS UNDERWAY...WITH 2 INCHES ALREADY REPORTED IN 
THE SOUTHERN CUMBERLAND PLATEAU. EXPECT THAT SOME OF THIS SNOW WILL 
START TO MIX WITH RAIN AND/OR SLEET AFTER 00Z. HOWEVER GIVEN THE 
EARLY ONSET OF SNOW IN THE SOUTHERN PLATEAU...WILL PUT MARION COUNTY 
INTO THE WINTER STORM WARNING. 

STRONG LIFT ASSOCIATED WITH MIDLEVEL FRONTOGENESIS AND AGEOSTROPHIC 
VERTICAL CIRCULATIONS IN THE RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE UPPER JET 
WILL MOVE OVER THE AREA TONIGHT. MODELS AGREE IN OVER 1 INCH LIQUID 
QPF ACROSS THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA...AND WITH 
A 10:1 RATIO...OVER 10 INCHES ARE EXPECTED IN THE NORTHERN HALF. 
SNOW AMOUNTS WILL BE BUMPED UP SLIGHTLY FROM KNOXVILLE NORTH. THE 
SOUTHERN HALF IS A DIFFERENT STORY AS THE NAM AND GFS SHOW A WARM 
NOSE DEVELOPING BETWEEN 06Z AND 12Z WHILE SURFACE COLD AIR IS 
SUPPLIED AROUND THE SOUTHERN END OF THE APPALACHIANS. EXPECT THAT 
THERE WILL BE A CHANGE TO MAINLY SLEET AND FREEZING RAIN IN THE 
SOUTHERN COUNTIES...AND WITH LIFT REMAINING FAIRLY STRONG DURING 
THIS TIME OVER NC...OUR SW NC COUNTIES COULD SEE A QUARTER INCH ICE 
ACCUMULATION. WILL ADD EASTERN POLK COUNTY TO THE WARNING AS A 
RESULT.

PRECIP BEGINS TO END SATURDAY MORNING WHEN DRY AIR MOVES INTO THE 
-10C TO -20C LEVEL...PREVENT ICE NUCLEATION. HOWEVER PLENTY OF LOW 
LEVEL MOISTURE REMAINS ALONG WITH LOW LEVEL CONVERGENCE FOR LIFT. 
THIS SHOULD RESULT IN DRIZZLE AND FREEZING DRIZZLE ON SATURDAY IN 
THE SOUTHERN HALF. MOISTURE ON THE BACK SIDE OF THE DEPARTING LOW 
AND THE PASSAGE OF THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS WILL KEEP SOME LIGHT SNOW 
IN THE NORTH SATURDAY EVENING. 

.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...MUCH BETTER CONDITIONS
SUNDAY AS UPPER LEVEL TROUGH EXITS AND BUILDING RIDGE OF HIGH
PRESSURE TAKES OVER. TEMPERATURES STILL COLD WITH SNOW COVER OVER
MOST IF NOT ALL OF CWA. CENTER OF HIGH OVERHEAD SUNDAY NIGHT AND
WITH SNOW ON GROUND UNDERCUT GUIDANCE FOR LOWS FROM 5 TO 15
DEGREES. UPPER HEIGHTS BUILD MONDAY SO HIGHS WARMER MID 30S NORTH
TO NEAR 50 SOUTH. ANOTHER COLD NIGHT MONDAY NIGHT BEFORE A WEAK
SHORT WAVE AND COLD FRONT WILL REACH THE REGION TUESDAY. HAVE
MAINLY SLIGHT CHANCE TUESDAY AND TUESDAY NIGHT. THIS SYSTEM MOVES
OUT QUICK WITH RIDGING WEDNESDAY.

THURSDAY ANOTHER STRONGER STORM SYSTEM DEVELOPS OVER TX WEDNESDAY
AND THEN MOVES EAST ALONG THE GULF THURSDAY AND FRIDAY. EXPECTING
THIS SYSTEM TO BE WARMER BUT SNOW POSSIBLE IN THE OVERNIGHT HOURS.
DUE TO THE UNCERTAINTY WITH THE EVOLUTION OF THIS SYSTEM IT MAY
PRODUCE MORE WINTERY PRECIP IF IT FOLLOWS A MORE SOUTHERN TRACK.

ONSET OF PRECIP AND START OF ACCUMULATIONS A BIT...AND WILL TRIM A 
COUPLE OF HOURS OFF OF THE START OF THE WINTER STORM WARNING.  
OTHERWISE...NO MAJOR CHANGES TO THE FORECAST.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY)...UPPER TROF AXIS 
ALIGNED WITH SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS SATURDAY NIGHT WITH PROGRESSIVE 
TRANSIT TO THE ATLANTIC COAST BY 12Z SUNDAY. SLIGHTLY TWEAKED POPS 
HIGHER FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AS SYSTEM EXITS PRODUCING LIGHT SNOW 
MAINLY ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEAST TENNESSEE. MODELS 
CONTINUE TO SHOW MUCH IMPROVED WEATHER FOR SUNDAY IN TERMS OF DRYING 
AND BUILDING LOW LEVEL RIDGE. STILL SHOULD BE A RATHER CHILLY DAY 
WITH SOME SNOW COVER AND CONTINUATION OF CAA. UPPER HEIGHTS BUILD ON 
MONDAY AWAITING NEXT WEAK SHORT WAVE AND ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT DUE 
IN THE FORECAST AREA AROUND TUESDAY. STAYED WITH A LOW CHANCE POP 
WITH A SLIGHT CHANCE BRACKET FOR MONDAY NIGHT FOR POSSIBLE QUICKER 
ARRIVAL AND ON TUESDAY NIGHT AS SYSTEM MAKES ITS EXIT INTO THE 
CAROLINAS. ANOTHER BRIEF BREAK IN THE ACTION EXPECTED FOR WEDNESDAY 
AS RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE REGION. STAYED WITH LATE WEEK STORM 
SYSTEM CONCEPT WHICH FEATURES ANOTHER SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE AND 
NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WHICH SHIFTS EAST 
NORTHEAST ACROSS THE DEEP SOUTH ON THURSDAY. DUE TO UNCERTAINTY WITH 
EVOLUTION OF THIS SYSTEM MAINTAINED SLIGHT AND LOW CHANCE POPS FOR 
THIS SYSTEM WHICH MAY PRODUCE MORE WINTERY PRECIP DUE TO ITS DEEP 
SOUTH TRACK. UNDERCUT MEX MOS TEMP GUIDANCE WHICH IS TOO OPTIMISTIC 
THROUGH MONDAY WITH POSSIBILITY OF A PERSISTANT SNOW COVER 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. TRENDED 
TEMPS A LITTLE CLOSER TO GUIDANCE FOR THE REMAINDER OF THE PERIOD.

AREA FORECAST DISCUSSION
NATIONAL WEATHER SERVICE MORRISTOWN TN
1000 PM EST THU JAN 28 2010

.DISCUSSION...FORECAST ON TRACK. TEMPS HAVE A WAY TO GO TO REACH
FCST MINS BUT CAA LOOKS GOOD. DPS FALLING INTO THE TEENS. SON

SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...
A COLD FRONT HAS PUSHED THROUGH THE AREA...BUT THE PUSH OF COLD AIR 
IS TRAILING THE FRONT...ALLOWING TEMPS TO WARM INTO THE 50S. TEMPS 
SHOULD BE FALLING QUICKLY WITH SUNSET HOWEVER AS THE COLDER AIR MASS 
MOVES IN...AND LOWS ARE EXPECTED TO BE IN THE 20S IN MOST SPOTS. 

THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM TAKING SHAPE OVER THE SOUTH CENTRAL U.S. 
WILL TRACK EAST AND AFFECT OUR AREA FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT. 
OVERALL THE MODELS ARE IN VERY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM. THE 
GFS IS STILL A TAD FASTER THAN THE NAM...BUT THEIR DEPICTIONS OF QPF 
AND LOCATION OF THE STRONGEST LIFT ARE QUITE SIMILAR. THIS LEADS TO 
A HIGHER CONFIDENCE FORECAST.

A STRONG UPPER JET ACROSS THE NORTHEAST U.S. WILL PLACE THE FORECAST 
AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET FROM FRIDAY 
AFTERNOON THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT. PRECIP WILL BEGIN TO OVERSPREAD THE 
AREA FRIDAY MORNING...BUT SOME LOW LEVEL DRY AIR WILL HAVE TO BE 
OVERCOME BEFORE IT REACHES THE GROUND. SO ACCUMULATING PRECIP SHOULD 
HOLD OFF UNTIL THE AFTERNOON. IT SHOULD BEGIN AS SNOW NORTH AND RAIN 
SOUTH. STRONG AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL CIRCULATION DUE TO THE JET WILL 
INCREASE THE FRONTOGENETIC FORCING OVER OUR AREA BETWEEN 00Z AND 
06Z. AT THIS TIME...LIFT IN THE DENDRITE GROWTH ZONE IS MAXIMIZED 
OVER THE CENTRAL THIRD OF THE AREA...ALLOWIGN FOR EFFICIENT SNOW 
FORMATION. CROSS SECTIONS SHOW SOME NEGATIVE EPV VALUES ABOVE THE 
MIDLEVEL FRONTOGENESIS...SO SOME SNOW BANDING CAN ALSO BE EXPECTED. 
BOTH MODELS CRANK OUT OVER 1 INCH OF LIQUID PRECIP OVER MOST OF THE 
AREA. THIS DOES NOT APPEAR UNREASONABLE.

THE DIFFICULT PART OF THE FORECAST IS THAT THE ZONE OF STRONGEST 
LIFT IS ALSO IN THE AREA OF P-TYPE TRANSITION...IN THE CENTRAL TN 
VALLEY. THE NAM AND GFS SHOW 850-700 THICKNESS VALUES RISING 
OVERNIGHT...WHICH COULD LEAD TO A PRECIP PHASE CHANGE. HOWEVER...THE 
STRONG DYNAMIC LIFT WILL TEND TO COOL THE VERTICAL COLUMN AIDING TO 
KEEP/CHANGE THE PRECIPITATION TO SNOW. THUS EXPECT THAT LOCATIONS 
FROM KNOWVILLE NORTH WILL BE ALL SNOW. IT WILL LIKELY BE A WET SNOW 
AS TEMPERATURE PROFILES SHOW A DEEP NEAR-FREEZING ISOTHERMAL LAYER. 
TO THE SOUTH...EXPECT THAT THERE WILL BE PERIODS OF RAIN AND 
SNOW...DEPENDING ON THE INTENSITY OF THE PRECIP AT ANY GIVEN TIME. 
AS THE 850-700 THICKNESS RISES...THERE WILL LIKELY BE A CHANGE TO 
SLEET. THIS SHOULD LIMIT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY 
AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU. 

AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM PULLS OFF THE ATLANTIC COAST...THE UPPER 
TROUGH WILL BE MOVING OVER THE AREA. THIS SHOULD BRING ADDITIONAL 
SNOWFALL TO NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE AREA. FARTHER SOUTH THE 
MOISTURE IS CONFINED TO THE LOW LEVELS...AND LIFT IS WEAK. WILL 
TAPER OFF ALL PRECIP SATURDAY EVENING.

A WINTER STORM WARNING WILL BE ISSUED FOR LOCATIONS ALONG AND NORTH 
OF A BLOUNT-LOUDON-ROANE COUNTY LINE...AND FOR EASTERN 
MONROE...CHEROKEE...AND CLAY COUNTIES (MAINLY HIGHER ELEVATIONS). IN 
THE WARNING AREA...5 TO 10 INCHES APPEARS PROBABLE...WITH UP TO 12 
INCHES IN THE MOUNTAINS. A WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY WILL BE ISSUED 
FOR THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN PLATEAU. EXPECT 1 INCH 
SNOW/SLEET IN LOWER ELEVATIONS...WITH UP TO 3 IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS. 

LONG TERM...(SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...
HIGH PRESSURE IN CONTROL SUNDAY. AFTER COLD START DUE TO
ANTICIPATED SNOW COVER TEMPERATURES SHOULD WARM INTO THE MID 30S TO
LOWER 40S SOUTH AND CENTRAL VALLEY AREAS WITH HIGHER ELEVATIONS
MOUNTAINS AND NORTHEAST SECTIONS ONLY UPPER 20S TO LOWER 30S.
CLOUDS SHOULD BE MOVED OUT WITH SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY. SUNDAY NIGHT
TEMPERATURES IN THE TEENS TO SINGLE DIGITS WITH CLEAR SKIES AND
LIGHT WINDS. SOME AREAS COULD BE NEAR ZERO WITH SIGNIFICANT SNOW
COVER. MONDAY HIGH PRESSURE STILL OVER FORECAST AREA WITH WARMING
TEMPERATURES. A NEW SYSTEM SLIDES DOWN FROM THE NW TUESDAY WITH A
CHANCE OF RAIN SOUTH OF INTERSTATE 40 AND RAIN AND OR SNOW NORTH OF
INTERSTATE 40. THIS LOOKS LIKE A FAIRLY WEAK SYSTEM. HIGH PRESSURE
BUILDS IN WEDNESDAY. ANOTHER MORE SIGNIFICANT SYSTEM MOVES IN FROM
THE SOUTH THURSDAY WITH RAIN/SNOW MOVING IN THURSDAY. TEMPERATURES
SHOULD WARM INTO THE 40S AREAWIDE THURSDAY.

CONTINUES TO BE SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH OVER THE SOUTHERN 
PLAINS WITH SURFACE CYCLOGENESIS ACROSS EAST TEXAS. MODELS ARE IN 
GOOD AGREEMENT IN PULLING THIS TROUGH EAST ACROSS THE TENNESSEE 
VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS THE LATTER HALF OF FRIDAY THROUGH 
SATURDAY. SURFACE TRACKS EAST ACROSS THE SOUTHERN GULF COAST 
STATES...THEN OFF THE CAROLINA COAST BY SATURDAY NIGHT.

STRONG DYNAMICS WITH THE SYSTEM WITH A NORTHERN STREAM JET ACROSS 
THE OHIO VALLEY AND NORTHEAST AND ANOTHER JET ASSOCIATED WITH THE 
SOUTHERN STREAM UPPER TROUGH. THESE FEATURES WILL PLACE THE FORECAST 
AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET FROM LATE 
FRIDAY THROUGH EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. THE STRENGTHENING OF 
AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL CIRCULATION DUE TO THE JET WILL INCREASE THE 
FRONTOGENETIC FORCING WITH STRONG DYNAMIC LIFT EVIDENT ON THE 
CROSS-SECTION OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS LIFT WILL TEND TO COOL 
THE VERTICAL COLUMN AIDING TO KEEP/CHANGE THE PRECIPITATION TO SNOW.

THE MODELS DIFFER SOME IN REGARD TO THE VERTICAL TEMPERATURE PROFILE 
WITH THE NAM BEING THE COLDEST. AT THIS TIME...I PREFER THE COLDER 
NAM SOLUTION DUE TO THE REASONS ABOVE. NAM SOLUTION SUGGEST A MOSTLY 
SNOW EVIDENT...EXCEPT POSSIBLY THE FAR SOUTHERN COUNTIES. PLAN ON 
EXPANDING THE WATCH TO INCLUDE THE SOUTHEAST SECTIONS (CHA AREA) AS 
WELL.

VERTICAL CROSS-SECTIONS ALSO SHOWS NEGATIVE EPV IN COMBINATION WITH 
STRONG OMEGA IN SATURATED AIRMASS...SO POTENTIAL OF SNOW BANDING 
EXISTS ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE TENNESSEE COUNTIES. IF BANDING 
OCCURS...SNOWFALL RATES WILL INCREASE. HAVE UPPED SNOWFALL AMOUNTS 
AREA-WIDE GIVEN THIS POTENTIAL.

THE SNOW WILL TAPER DOWN TO SNOW SHOWERS FOR SATURDAY.

A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL BUILD IN THE AREA FOR SUNDAY AND 
MONDAY BEFORE ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVES TOWARD THE AREA FOR TUESDAY AND 
WEDNESDAY WITH INCREASING ISENTROPIC LIFT.

1000 PM EST WED JAN 27 2010

.DISCUSSION...MINOR UPDATE TO TONIGHTS FORECAST. CLOUD COVER 
INCREASING OVERNIGHT IN ADVANCE OF APPROACHING COLD FRONT. WEAK WAA 
ALSO WILL BEGIN OVERNIGHT. INCREASED CLOUD COVER AND RAISED MINS A 
COUPLE DEGREES ACROSS SOUTHERN AND CENTRAL AREAS. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:
SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...TONIGHT THROUGH THURSDAY 
NIGHT...A COLD FRONT OVER THE UPPER MS VALLEY AND GREAT LAKES WILL 
MOVE INTO THE OHIO VALLEY TONIGHT...THEN INTO THE GREAT TN VALLEY ON 
THURSDAY. WITH A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE OVER THE SOUTHEAST 
CONUS...THERE WILL BE VERY LITTLE MOISTURE FOR THIS FRONT TO WORK 
WITH. SO EXPECT JUST MID TO HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TO AFFECT THE AREA 
THROUGH THURSDAY. BEHIND THE FRONT...A COLDER AIR MASS WILL BUILD 
INTO THE AREA THURSDAY NIGHT.

FRIDAY THROUGH SATURDAY...A VIGOROUS SOUTHERN STREAM VORT MAX OVER 
THE BAJA THIS AFTERNOON WILL TRACK EAST...INDUCING CYCLOGENESIS 
OVER TX THURSDAY. THIS TROUGH WILL MERGE WITH A NORTHERN STREAM 
SHORTWAVE TROUGH ON FRIDAY. THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS WILL BE IN THE 
RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF A STRONG POLAR JET. THE RESULTING 
AGEOSTROPHIC VERTICAL CIRCULATION AND UPPER DIVERGENCE WILL BRING 
LIFT INTO OUR AREA FRIDAY AFTERNOON. AS THE SYSTEM TRACKS 
EAST...MIDLEVEL FRONTOGENESIS ON THE NORTH SIDE OF THE LOW WILL 
FURTHER ENHANCE THE PRECIP FRIDAY NIGHT...PEAKING AROUND MIDNIGHT. 
THE GFS CONTINUES TO BE THE FASTER OF THE MODELS...WITH THE NAM 
BEING SLOWEST...BUT THE TREND OF BOTH MODELS SEEMS TO BE A SLIGHTLY 
SLOWER SOLUTION COMPARED TO PREVIOUS RUNS. 

CONFIDENCE IS HIGH THAT THE DEPTH OF COLD AIR WILL BE SUFFICIENT FOR 
THE PRECIP TO BE ALL SNOW ACROSS THE NORTHERN CUMBERLAND 
PLATEAU...NORTHEAST TN...SOUTHWEST VA...AND THE TN MOUNTAINS. IN 
THIS AREA...SNOW AMOUNTS OF 6 TO 10 INCHES WILL BE 
POSSIBLE...PERHAPS MORE IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. FARTHER 
SOUTH...THE SITUATION IS MUCH MORE QUESTIONABLE. TEMPERATURE 
PROFILES INDICATE A DEEP NEAR-FREEZING ISOTHERMAL LAYER...MEANING 
THAT ONLY SLIGHT CHANGES IN TEMPERATURE COULD MEAN THE DIFFERENCE 
BETWEEN SIGNIFICANT SNOW ACCUMULATIONS OR NO SNOW ACCUMULATIONS. 
THERE COULD ALSO BE SEVERAL CHANGES BACK AND FORTH BETWEEN SNOW AND 
RAIN...AND PERHAPS A LITTLE SLEET...ESPECIALLY AT THE ONSET. AT THIS 
TIME...THE TRANSITION ZONE APPEARS TO BE JUST SOUTH OF KNOXVILLE. 
LOCATIONS IN THE CENTRAL VALLEY COULD SEE AS MUCH AS 5 INCHES...OR 
AS LITTLE AS 1 INCH...DEPENDING ON EXACTLY WHERE THE TRANSITION ZONE 
SETS UP. IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY INCLUDING CHATTANOOGA...ALTHOUGH 
THERE COULD BE SOME MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW AND SLEET AT THE 
ONSET...EXPECT THAT MOST OF THE PRECIP WILL BE RAIN UNTIL LATE 
FRIDAY NIGHT. LESS THAN 2 INCHES IS EXPECTED THERE.

A WINTER STORM WATCH WILL BE ISSUED FOR THE CENTRAL TN VALLEY AND 
LOCATIONS NORTH...AS WELL AS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS OF 
BLEDSOE...SEQUATCHIE...CHEROKEE NC...AND CLAY NC...STARTING 2 PM 
FRIDAY THROUGH 4 PM SATURDAY. AN SPS WILL BE ISSUED FOR LOCATIONS

LONG TERM (SATURDAY NIGHT THOUGH WEDNESDAY)...A FEW LIGHT SNOW 
SHOWERS OR FLURRIES WILL LINGER OVER THE AREA SATURDAY EVENING... 
SLOWLY EXITING THE AREA OVERNIGHT AS THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
CONTINUES TO PULL AWAY FROM THE REGION.  LITTLE TO NO ADDITIONAL 
ACCUMULATION IS EXPECTED.  MUCH COLDER AND DRIER AIR WILL SLIDE IN 
BEHIND THE SYSTEM.  OVERNIGHT LOWS ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY WILL 
BE 10 TO 15 DEGREES BELOW NORMAL SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY NIGHT.  
TEMPERATURES WILL MODERATE ON MONDAY.  BY TUESDAY...TEMPERATURES 
SHOULD REACH NEAR NORMAL LEVELS AS THE NEXT SYSTEM MOVE INTO THE

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...RADAR INDICATING SNOW HAS EXITED 
THE AREA.  STILL A FEW CLOUDS LINGERING OVER THE EASTERN HALF OF THE 
CWA ASSOCIATED WITH A WEAK SHORTWAVE.  THE DISTURBANCE SHOULD BE 
GONE EARLY THIS MORNING WITH DECREASING CLOUDS EXPECTED EARLY TODAY 
AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN. SHOULD SEE A FEW HIGH LEVEL CLOUDS TODAY 
AND TONIGHT AHEAD OF THE NEXT SYSTEM...BUT DRY WEATHER IS EXPECTED 
TODAY AND TONIGHT.  WITH THE CLOUDS EXPECTED...WENT BELOW MAV 
GUIDANCE FOR TODAY AND STAYED NEAR THE MET/MAV BLEND NUMBERS.  
GUIDANCE TEMPERATURES FOR TONIGHT SIMILAR SO DIDN'T STRAY TOO FAR.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...MAIN WEATHER FEATURE IS 
DEVELOPING UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE SOUTHERN PLAINS AND NORTHERN 
STREAM LONG-WAVE TROUGH OVER EASTERN CANADA. FIRST...THE NORTHERN 
STEAM TROUGH WILL PULL A FRONT THROUGH THE FORECAST AREA THURSDAY. 
MOISTURE AND DYNAMICS WITH THE FRONT IS LACKING AND WILL CALL FOR A 
DRY FROPA. HOWEVER...MAIN FEATURE FROM THIS SYSTEM IS THE COLDER AIR 
SPILLING INTO THE OHIO AND TENNESSEE VALLEYS AHEAD OF SOUTHERN 
STREAM SHORT-WAVE.

MODELS ARE IN PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT IN TAKING THE SURFACE LOW FROM 
EAST TEXAS THEN ACROSS THE SOUTHERN GULF COAST STATES. THIS TRACK 
BODES WELL FOR SNOW ACROSS MOST OF THE FORECAST AREA. STRONG UPPER 
JET WILL BE ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY INTO THE NORTHEAST PLACING THE 
FORECAST AREA UNDER THE FAVORED RIGHT ENTRANCE REGION OF THE JET. 
THE IN-DIRECT CIRCULATION AROUND THIS SYSTEM WILL HELP INDUCE AN 
INVERTED TROUGH ACROSS THE TENNESSEE VALLEY ENHANCING FRONTOGENETIC 
FORCING AND BOUNDARY LAYER CONVERGENCE. ALSO...ISENTROPIC LIFT CAN 
BE EXPECTED INITIALLY ON FRIDAY.

THERE ARE SOME FAIRLY SIGNIFICANT DIFFERENCES IN THE VERTICAL 
TEMPERATURE PROFILE WITH THE NAM THE COLDEST. GIVEN THE ARCTIC AIR 
POISED JUST NORTH OF THE TENNESSEE VALLEY AND FAVORED SURFACE LOW 
TRACK...I PREFER THE COLDER SOLUTION. WILL CALL FOR ALL SNOW TRI AND 
MRX...MAINLY SNOW TYS (POSSIBLY MIXING WITH SLEET AT TIMES)...AND A 
MIXTURE FOR CHA CHANGING TO ALL SNOW FRIDAY NIGHT. PRELIMINARY 
SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS RANGE FROM 4 TO 8 INCHES FOR TYS NORTHWARD 
(GREATER AMOUNTS OVER THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS). FOR SOUTHERN THIRD OF 
FORECAST AREA...SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WILL VARY GREATLY DEPENDING ON 
ELEVATION. CHA SNOWFALL POSSIBLY 1 TO 3 INCHES WITH HIGHER AMOUNTS 
OVER LOOKOUT-SIGNAL MOUNTAINS AND PLATEAU.

MAIN SNOWFALL WILL START FRIDAY WHICH IS OUR FIFTH PERIOD...SO WILL 
NOT ISSUE A WATCH...BUT DAY SHIFT AND DEFINITELY MIDNIGHT SHIFT WILL 
LIKELY ISSUE ONE. WILL MODIFY THE CURRENT SPS AND SEND OUT LATER 
THIS MORNING.

ANOTHER SYSTEM MOVES INTO THE AREA MONDAY AND TUESDAY OF NEXT WEEK.
HAVE TRIMMED GFS MOS HIGHS FOR FRIDAY AND SATURDAY DUE TO THE SNOW.

CONTINUE ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND NORTHEASTERN TENNESSEE THIS 
EVENING WITH A FEW FLURRIES ACROSS CENTRAL EAST TENNESSEE. COULD SEE 
ANOTHER INCH OF SNOW IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN AS OROGRAPHIC LIFT 
CONTINUES IN MODERATE TO STRONG CAA. PRECIP SHOULD TAPER MUCH OF 
THIS AREA BY LATE EVENING. HOWEVER WILL LIKELY CONTINUE IN THE 
HIGHER TERRAIN ALONG THE NORTH CAROLINA BORDER. DRIER AIR GRAUDALLY 
WINS OUT REVEALING SOME SUNSHINE FOR WEDNESDAY AS PRESSURES INCH 
UPWARD A TAD. CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING AGAIN WEDNESDAY NIGHT AS A 
NORTHERN STREAM UPPER TROF SLIPS SOUTHEAST INTO THE NORTHEASTERN 
U.S. DRIVING YET ANOTHER COLD FRONT TOWARD THE FORECAST AREA. AT THE 
SAME TIME AN AMPLIFYING UPPER LEVEL LOW WILL BE SHIFTING SLOWLY EAST 
OUT OF THE SOUTHWESTERN U.S. WEAK ISENTROPIC AND FRONTAL LIFT MAY 
ENCOURAGE A SPRINKLE OF SNOW OR LIGHT RAIN ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA 
ON THURSDAY BUT THE MAIN PRECIPITATION EVENT WILL OCCUR BEYOND THE 
SHORT TERM PERIOD. STAYED FAIRLY CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND CONCERNING 
MAX AND MIN TEMPS DURING THE SHORT TERM FORECAST. 

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...SURFACE LOW PRESSURE 
MOVES TO LOUISIANA BY FRI MORNING. FRONTOGENESIS AROUND 700 MB 
TAKING SHAPE ACROSS NW PART OF MRX CWA. ISENTROPIC LIFT 
UNDERWAY...PCPN WILL CHANGE TO SNOW AND ADVANCE EAST INTO AREA THU

TONGUE WORKING NE INTO THE AREA TO NEAR TYS BY FRI AFTN. THOU THE 
POTENTIAL IS THERE FOR PERIODS OF FREEZING RAIN...BELIEVE PHASE 
TRANSITIONS WILL BE FAST SO KEPT FORECAST BASICALLY SNOW OR RAIN. 
LIQUID PCPN WORKS NE INTO THE AREA FRI THEN RETREATS SE AS LOW 
PRESSURE SYSTEM TRACKS TO SOUTH OF AREA AND CAA BEGINS TO WORK BACK 
IN FROM THE NE. THIS SCENARIO MAKES SNOW TOTAL FORECAST NEARLY 
IMPOSSIBLE AT THIS POINT FOR SOUTHERN AREAS. LATEST ECMWF IS MUCH 
WEAKER WITH THE WAA ... ALL SNOW ... BUT DOES NOT TRANSPORT AS MUCH 
MOISTURE TO THE NORTH. SO FORECAST CONFIDENCE REMAINS LOW-MODERATE. 
NORTHERN AREAS WENT WITH A 10 TO 1 ...SNOW TO LIQUID RATIO  WHICH

PLENTY OF SHORT WAVE ENERGY AND MOISTURE TO KEEP WINTER GOING ACROSS 
THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS AGAIN TODAY. MAIN FEATURE DROPPING 
SOUTHEAST THROUGH KENTUCKY THIS MORNING. ARRIVAL WILL BE A LITTLE

THE PERIOD. THE FIRST ONE IS GENERATING MOSTLY LIGHT RAIN AND VERY 
LIKELY SNOW AT HIGHER ELEVATION ACROSS NORTHERN AND CENTRAL PARTS OF 
THE FORECAST AREA. THE SECOND ONE IS BUILDING SOUTHEAST THROUGH 
INDIANA AND ILLINOIS AND A THIRD WILL KEEP A FEW SNOW SHOWERS GOING 
ACROSS THE HIGHEST TERRAIN OF SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME 
NORTHEAST TENNESSEE THROUGH A GOOD PART OF THE DAY TUESDAY. STAYED 
WITH THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY FOR SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND MOST OF 
THE HIGHER TERRAIN BORDERING NORTH CAROLINA AS LIFT WILL BE 
GENERATED BY THE SHORT WAVES AS WELL AS FAIRLY DECENT LAPSE RATES 
WHICH ARE PRODUCING A CELLULAR LOOK TO THE RADAR/SAT IMAGE THIS 
AFTERNOON. ADD TO THIS THE OROGRAPHIC COMPONENT AND THE ADVISORY 
AREA SHOULD SEE ANYWHERE FROM 1 TO 3 INCHES OF SNOW WITH THE GREATER 
TOTALS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. IN ELEVATIONS ABOVE 4000 FT AMOUNTS 
COULD BE AS HIGH AS 4 INCHES. KEPT SNOW SHOWERS GOING ON TUESDAY IN 
THESE AREAS AS THE FINAL WAVE SWINGS EAST. MOISTURE WILL BECOME MORE 
SHALLOW AND THE SHORT WAVE WILL MAINLY IMPACT THE CENTRAL 
APPALACHIANS SO KEPT SNOWFALL GENERALLY AROUND AN INCH FOR SNOW THAT
OCCURS ON TUESDAY. MAINTAINED THE WIND ADVISORY THROUGH MID EVENING 
AS THE RATHER BOUYANT ATMOSPHERE MIXES HIGHER VELOCITY FLOW TO THE 
SURFACE. CONCERNING TEMPS WENT CLOSE TO GUIDANCE BLEND FOR TONIGHT 
AND EDGED CLOSER TO THE COOLER MET MAXES FOR TUESDAY UNDER THE 
LIMITING INFLUENCE OF HEALTHY COLD AIR ADVECTION AND LIMITED 
SUNSHINE.

.DISCUSSION...SUPPOSE THE CURRENT FORECAST IN DECENT SHAPE WITH LONG 
WAVE TROF EXTENDING FROM THE MIDWEST THROUGH THE SOUTHEASTERN 
STATES. THE UPPER TROF APPARENTLY HAS SEVERAL SHORTER WAVELENGTH 
FEATURES ROTATING THROUGH ITS CIRCULATION. FIRST LITTLE FEATURE HAS 
BECOME ENHANCED SINCE SUNRISE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA WITH SOME 
MODEL INSTABILITY NOTED. THIS IS GENERATING SOME LIGHT RAIN FROM 
AROUND MIDDLESBORO SOUTH THROUGH KNOXVILLE. ANOTHER MINOR FEATURE IS 
SHIFTING EAST ACROSS THE OHIO VALLEY THROUGH THE MID SOUTH CREATING 
SOME LIGHT RAIN ACROSS MIDDLE TENNESSEE WITH A FLAKE OR TWO OF SNOW 
FARTHER NORTH IN KENTUCKY. AND FARTHER NORTHWEST PERHAPS THE MAIN 
FEATURE OF INTEREST TO GENERATE SOME SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE VIEWING 
AREA FOR TONIGHT IS IN PLACE OVER ILLINOIS AND MISSOURI. COLD AIR 
ADVECTION GETS GOING TO A GREATER DEGREE LATER THIS AFTERNOON AND 
WILL HAVE THE GREATEST IMPACT AT HIGHER ELEVATIONS WHERE PATCHY 
LIGHT RAIN WILL MIX WITH AND CHANGE TO SNOW SO WILL SEND WSW 
REMINDER OUT AGAIN. ALSO WILL SHIP THE WIND ADVISORY REMINDER AS 
WELL DUE TO MODERATELY TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT BEING AIDED BY CHILLY 
AIR ALOFT WHICH IS HELPING TO MIX HIGHER SPEED WINDS TO THE SURFACE. 
TEMPERATURES MOST LIKELY REMAINING STEADY OR SLOWLY FALLING FOR THIS

AREAS THURSDAY MORNING...WITH WITH WARM ADVECTION...DAYBREAK TEMPS 
AT SURFACE AND ALOFT WILL LIKELY SUPPORT RAIN VERSUS FREEZING 
PRECIP.  ALSO...SHOULD BE VERY LIGHT AT ONSET...AS DRY AIR NEAR 
SURFACE TRIES TO EVAPORATE INITIAL PRECIP.  

COLDER AIR PUSHES IN FROM NORTHWEST DURING THE DAY ON THURSDAY AND 
INTO THURSDAY NIGHT.  RAIN/SNOW LINE WILL BE INTERESTING...RIGHT NOW 
HAVE TIMING FOR MAINLY RAIN ON THURSDAY...EXCEPT IN EXTREME 
NORTH...BUT REST OF AREA CHANGES OVER TO SNOW OVERNIGHT.  WILL 
LIKELY SEE MEASURABLE SNOW IN MOUNTAINS AND POSSIBLY OVER THE 
NORTHERN AREAS.  

FOR FRIDAY...GFS RUSHES SYSTEM OUT OF THE AREA...WILL PLAN ON A 
LITTLE SLOWER SCENARIO...MORE LIKE EURO AND CANADIAN MODELS.

COLD AND DRIER AIR MOVES IN FOR MOST OF THE WEEKEND.  KEEPING SOME 
SLIGHT SNOW SHOWER CHANCES FOR NORTHEAST AND MOUNTAINS ON SATURDAY 
FOR MINIMAL NW FLOW EVENT THAT TAPERS OFF QUICKLY.

401 PM EST SUN JAN 24 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...LARGE SWATH OF MODERATE
TO HEAVY SHOWERS WORKING SLOWLY NORTHEAST...AND FINALLY SEEING SOME
RAINS FALL IN THE DOWNSLOPED AREAS. KEPT A MENTION OF THUNDERSTORMS
...BUT MAIN PROBLEM WILL BE LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS. FLOOD WATCH
CONTINUES...WITH MUCH OF THE WRN AND CENTRAL COUNTIES IN AN URBAN
AND SMALL STREAM FLOOD ADVISORY. 

REPLACED HIGH WIND WARNING AREA WITH A WIND ADVISORY...AND LET THE
WIND ADVISORY AREAS EXPIRE. EXPECT WINDS TO NOT BE AN ISSUE AFTER
MID TO LATE EVENING. 

OTHERWISE...CLOUDS HANG IN AND COOLER AIR FLOWS INTO THE REGION
THROUGH THE REST OF THE SHORT TERM. THREAT FOR ANY SIGNIFICANT SNOW
LOOKS VERY SLIM...GIVEN WARM SURFACE TEMPS AND LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES.
BEST CHANCE FOR SNOW SHOWERS WILL BE MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUSEDAY
MORNING AS AN UPPER LEVEL DISTURBANCE SWINGS ACROSS...AND STRONGEST
COLD AIR ADVECTION OCCURS (SOME HINT OF NW UPSLOPE FLOW ALSO).

OTHERWISE...MOS TEMPS QUTIE CLOSE AND GENERALLY FOLLOWED...ALTHO
DID PREFER THE COOLER NAM HIGHS TUESDAY.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER FLOW BECOMES ZONAL 
FOLLOWING DEPARTURE OF NORTHEASTERN U.S. TROF. THEREFORE LIGHT 
OROGRAPHIC SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD COME TO AN END TUESDAY EVENING WITH 
DRIER CONDITIONS FOR WEDNESDAY. NEXT SYSTEM TO IMPACT THE FORECAST 
AREA WILL BE A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE WHICH INDUCES A SURFACE 
WAVE OVER THE SOUTHERN PLAINS WHICH PRESSES EAST INTO CENTRAL 
ALABAMA BY 12Z FRIDAY. USED GOOD CHANCE THROUGH LIKELY POPS FOR THE 
EVENT THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. POPS PROBABLY NOT TOO BAD AT THIS 
POINT BUT THE PRECIP TYPE SOMEWHAT UNCERTAIN. MIN TEMPS COULD BE A 
FEW DEGREES WARMER WHICH WOULD ALLOW FOR LIQUID PRECIP MOST OF THE 
NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. HOWEVER IN ORDER TO STAY IN LINE 
WITH NEIGHBORING WFO'S USED LOWER MIN TEMPS AND THEREFORE MORE 
FROZEN PRECIP. BETTER CHANCE THAT PRECIP WILL BE FROZEN...AND THUS 
IN THE FORM OF SNOW SHOWERS...WILL BE FRIDAY NIGHT INTO SATURDAY AS 
NORTHWEST FLOW DEVELOPS WITH AMPLIFYING EASTERN STATES UPPER TROF. 
TROF DEPARTS WITH BUILDING HEIGHTS ALOFT SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY 
AND MAINTAINED A DRY FORECAST FOR THIS PERIOD. TEMP FORECAST 
UNDERCUT GUIDANCE THROUGHOUT THE EXTENDED PERIOD.

.DISCUSSION...HIGH WIND EVENT CONTINUES THIS MORNING WITH LATEST 
GUST OF 71 KNOTS AT COVE MTN FIRETOWER NEAR GATLINBURG...WHILE CAMP 
CREEK WIND TOWER HAS HAD VERY STRONG GUSTS AS WELL (SEE LSRMRX). 
AREA RADAR WIND PROFILERS SHOW SOUTHERLY LOW LEVEL JET CURRENTLY OF 
50 TO 60 KNOTS. WILL MONITOR WINDS INTO THE AFTERNOON...TO SEE IF 
HIGH WIND WARNING AND/OR WIND ADVISORY NEED EXTENDING.

OTHER CONCERN IS FOR POSSIBILITY OF FLOODING AS MODELS INDICATE THAT 
THE COLD FRONT MAY BE SLOWING DOWN...WITH ANOTHER ROUND OF AT LEAST 
SHOWERS PROGGED FOR TONIGHT WITH THE ACTUAL FRONTAL PASSAGE. RAIN SO 
FAR HAS NOT BEEN HEAVY IN OUR FORECAST AREA...BUT EXTREME EASTERN 
AREAS MAY GET ENOUGH RAIN TO AT LEAST MONITOR MORE CLOSELY...AND 
CONSIDER A FLOOD WATCH FOR SOME AREAS IN THE AFTERNOON PACKAGE. 
HOWEVER...KMRX RADAR IS CLEARLY SHOWING THE DOWNSLOPING EFFECT OF 
REDUCING RAINFALL FOR THE CENTRAL AND NRN VALLEY AREAS OF E TN INTO 
PARTS OF SWRN VA.

A CONSERVATIVE PROJECTED 24 HOUR RAINFALL LOOKS TO PUSH THE FRENCH 
BROAD AND PIGEON RIVERS NEAR NEWPORT TN (COCKE COUNTY) A COUPLE OF 
FEET ABOVE FLOOD STAGE. SEE OUR LATEST FLW PRODUCT...MORE ON THIS IN 
THE AFTERNOON AFD.

305 AM EST SUN JAN 24 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A 
LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER THE OZARKS...WITH ITS TRAILING 
COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE MS RIVER VALLEY. A HIGH END 
MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT APPEARS TO BE UNDERWAY ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS AND 
THEIR WESTERN FOOTHILLS...WITH BOTH THE COVE MOUNTAIN AND CAMP CREEK 
WIND TOWERS REPORTING WIND GUSTS IN THE 70 TO 75 MPH RANGE. THE PEAK 
OF THIS HIGH WIND EVENT WILL LIKELY OCCUR IN THE MORNING HOURS AFTER 
SUNRISE...AS THE 850 MB JET (IN EXCESS OF 70 KT) MOVES ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA. WITH WIND GUSTS ALREADY OVER 70 MPH...WILL PLAN TO 
BEEF UP THE WORDING IN THE HIGH WIND WARNING PRODUCT TO MENTION THE 
POSSIBILITY OF 80 TO 100 MPH WIND GUSTS IN THE FOOTHILLS. MODEL 
SOUNDINGS REVEAL SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT WITH A LOW LEVEL INVERSION BELOW 800 
MB. THUS...WILL CONTINUE WITH A MENTION OF SOME TSTORMS FOR TODAY 
DUE TO THE ELEVATED INSTABILITY...AND WILL EXTEND THE WIND ADVISORY 
FOR THE REST OF THE FORECAST AREA (INCLUDING THE ENTIRE GREAT TN 
VALLEY). THIS LOW-LEVEL INVERSION MAY PREVENT MUCH OF THE 850 MB 
WINDS FROM LOWERING INTO THE VALLEYS...BUT THE BROKEN LINE OF 
CONVECTION ALONG THE COLD FRONT MAY BE ABLE TO LOWER SOME OF THESE 
VERY STRONG 850 MB WINDS INTO THE VALLEYS (ESPECIALLY WITH ANY DEEP 
CONVECTION). BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS HAVE SLOWED DOWN THE 
EASTWARD MOVEMENT OF THE COLD FRONT FOR TODAY...WITH FRONTAL PASSAGE 
NOW EXPECTED FROM MID TO LATE AFTERNOON. THIS SLOWER MOVEMENT MAY 
ENCOURAGE SOME STRONGER CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA TODAY...DUE TO THE MORE FAVORABLE DIURNAL HEATING TIMING. AS 
FOR TEMPS...WILL RAISE TEMPS WELL ABOVE GUIDANCE IN THE CENTRAL AND 
NORTHERN VALLEYS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EXPECTED ADIABATIC FOEHN WARMING 
FROM THE SOUTHEASTERLY WIND FLOW. OTHERWISE...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND LOOK REASONABLE. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH SATURDAY)...MODELS AND ENSEMBLES ARE IN 
GENERAL AGREEMENT THAT LIGHT PRECIP WILL LINGER THROUGH THE EARLY PART
OF THE WORK WEEK AS UPPER LONG WAVE TROUGH SETS UP OVER THE EASTERN
CONUS. FLOW DEAMPLIFIES BY MID WEEK AND BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL. DRY
WEATHER EXPECTED TO ACCOMPANY THIS ZONAL FLOW PATTERN. NEXT SYSTEM
APPROACHES THE REGION ON THURSDAY. MODELS/ENSEMBLES HAVE COME INTO
SOMEWHAT BETTER AGREEMENT WITH THIS SYSTEM. DRY WEATHER RETURNS BY
THE WEEKEND BUT COLD AIR BEHIND SYSTEM WILL DROP TEMPS BACK BELOW
CLIMO. GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE WITH RESPECT
TO TEMPS.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED OVER 
THE OZARKS...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS THE 
MS RIVER VALLEY. A BROKEN LINE OF CONVECTION HAS FORMED AHEAD OF 
THIS FRONT OVER WEST TN...AND WILL LIKELY AFFECT THE EAST TN TAF 
SITES AROUND SUNRISE AND THEREAFTER. THE MAIN STORY DURING THE FIRST

EIGHT HOURS OF THE TAFS. MAY HAVE TO EXTEND THIS LOW LEVEL WIND 
SHEAR THROUGH THE LATE MORNING HOURS...BUT WILL EVALUATE THIS 
POSSIBILITY LATER AS THE FRONT APPROACHES. EXPECT MVFR CONDITIONS 
WITH THE MAIN BAND OF SHOWERS...AND TEMPORARY IFR CONDITIONS WITH 
SCATTERED TSTORMS AT CHA AND TYS. FRONTAL PASSAGE EXPECTED DURING

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...MOST SIGNIFICANT WEATHER FOR 
THESE PERIODS WILL BE THE FIRST 24 TO 30 HOURS...AS SURFACE LOW 
TRACKS NORTH ACROSS MID MISS VALLEY TONIGHT TO WESTERN GREAT LAKES 
BY SUNDAY EVENING. STRONG SE LOW LEVEL JET DEVELOPS AHEAD OF THE 
ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT...WHICH WILL PROVIDE VERY WINDY CONDITIONS TO 
THE MTNS AND FOOTHILLS (MTN WAVE) AND AN EARLY PERIOD OF DOWNSLOPING 
FOR CENTRL AND NRN VALLEY LOCATIONS OF THE FORECAST AREA. IN GENERAL 
BOTH GFS AND NAM SHOW THE EFFECTS OF DOWNSLOPING WITH VERY LIGHT QPF 
FOR DOWNSLOPE AREAS...ALTHO SHOWERS SHOULD SPREAD INTO WRN AND SRN 
AREAS IN THE 06Z TO 12Z SUNDAY PERIOD. SOME LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS MAY 
OCCUR OVER EXTREME SE TN AND SW NC...BUT BRUNT OF HEAVY RAINS WILL 
BE OVER WRN NC NORTH INTO RNK AREA.

PUSHED HIGH WIND WATCH TO A WARNING...AND ISSUED A WIND ADVISORY FOR 
NEARBY HIGHER TERRAIN AREAS. PREVIOUS POP AND WEATHER (WX) GRIDS 
LOOKED GOOD FOR TONIGHT (WITH A SLIGHT DECREASE IN POPS FOR DOWNSLOPE
AREAS) AND GENERALLY THROUGH MONDAY. COLD AIR ADVECTION AND SOME 
WRAP AROUND MOISTURE WARRANTS DECREASING POPS SUNDAY NIGHT AND 
MONDAY. HOWEVER...COLD AIR ARRIVES QUITE LATE SUNDAY NIGHT...SO 
WON'T ANTICIPATE MUCH THREAT OF SNOW SHOWERS INTO MONDAY MORNING FOR 
NOW. SURFACE TEMPS AND LOW LEVEL THICKNESSES APPEAR TO BE TOO WARM.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...EARLY PART OF THE 
FORECAST WILL FEATURE NORTHWEST (UPSLOPE) FLOW AND A COUPLE OF SHORT 
WAVE IMPULSES THROUGH TUESDAY. CANADIAN AIR AND SUFFICIENTLY DEEP 
MOISTURE WILL BE IN PLACE FOR SOME SNOW SHOWERS WITH OROGRAPHIC LIFT 
REQUIRING SLIGHTLY HIGHER POP IN THE MOUNTAINS. UPPER LEVEL FLOW 
FINALLY FLATTENS OUT ON WEDNESDAY AS ATMOSPHERE PREPARES FOR THE 
ARRIVAL OF A SOUTHERN STREAM SHORTWAVE. ISENTROPIC LIFTING PROCESSES 
ALONG WITH INCREASING PACIFIC AND GULF MOISTURE WILL LEAD TO 
INCREASING PROBABILITY OF PRECIP MAINLY THURSDAY NIGHT INTO FRIDAY. 
SOUTHEAST STATES SURFACE LOW PRESSURE WITH INVERTED TROFFING NORTH 
THROUGH THE MID SOUTH WILL SHIFT EAST FROM THE LOWER MISSISSIPPI 
VALLEY TO THE CAROLINA COAST BY 12Z SATURDAY. STAYED IN A MEDIUM 
CHANCE POP CATEGORY FOR THE EVENT WHICH WRAPS UP DURING THE DAY 
SATURDAY AS DRIER AIR FILTERS IN BEHIND THE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS 
SHOWS A WEAK INVERTED TROUGH OVER THE GREAT TN VALLEY...WITH AREAS 
OF FOG AND LOW CLOUDS OVER THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA. SO FAR...THE 
LOW CLOUDS HAVE KEPT THE FOG FROM BECOMING TOO DENSE...BUT WILL 
CONTINUE TO MONITOR TO SEE IF A DENSE FOG ADVISORY IS NEEDED LATER 
THIS MORNING. OTHERWISE...MODELS INDICATE THAT AN UPPER-LEVEL RIDGE 
WILL BUILD OVER THE FORECAST AREA TODAY...POSSIBLY CREATING SOME 
BREAKS IN THE CLOUD COVER BY THIS AFTERNOON. WITH SOME DOWNSLOPE 
SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS INCREASING THROUGHOUT THE DAY...WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION PARTLY SUNNY SKIES BY THE AFTERNOON. A STRONG LOW PRESSURE 
SYSTEM OVER THE CENTRAL PLAINS IS PROGGED TO MOVE NORTHEAST INTO THE 
GREAT LAKES REGION BY SUNDAY...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT MOVING 
EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY. BOTH THE GFS AND NAM MODELS REVEAL 
A VERY STRONG 850 MB JET (IN EXCESS OF 80 KTS) DEVELOPING ACROSS 
MIDDLE TN LATE SATURDAY NIGHT AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT. WITH MODEL 
SOUNDINGS ALSO REVEALING SOUTHEASTERLY LOW-LEVEL WINDS PERPENDICULAR 
TO THE MOUNTAINS...A STABLE LAYER EXTENDING ABOVE THE MOUNTAIN 
RIDGES...AND A VEERING VERTICAL WIND PROFILE THAT INCREASES WITH 
HEIGHT...IT APPEARS THAT A HIGH END MOUNTAIN WAVE EVENT WILL DEVELOP 
BY MID EVENING INTO SUNDAY AFTERNOON BEFORE WINDS SHIFT TO THE 
SOUTHWEST. 

MODEL SOUNDINGS ALSO REVEAL SOME ELEVATED INSTABILITY DEVELOPING 
AHEAD OF THE COLD FRONT ON SUNDAY...SO WILL MENTION A CHANCE FOR 
TSTORMS. WITH A LOW-LEVEL INVERSION SEEN ON THE MODEL SOUNDINGS... 
THIS STABLE LAYER MAY PREVENT MUCH LOWERING OF THE STRONG 850 MB 
WINDS ON SUNDAY. ALSO...MODELS ARE CURRENTLY INDICATING THAT MOST 
CONVECTIVE DEVELOPMENT WILL OCCUR OVER THE CAROLINAS ON SUNDAY 
AFTERNOON...SINCE THE COLD FRONT IS PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE THROUGH 
THE FORECAST AREA ON SUNDAY MORNING. OVERALL...MODELS INDICATE THAT 
INSTABILITY WILL BE WEAK OVER THE FORECAST AREA (MAINLY DUE TO THE 
DIURNAL TIMING OF FRONT)...BUT WITH SUCH A STRONG AND DYNAMIC 
SYSTEM...IT IS STILL PRUDENT TO MENTION THE POSSIBILITY OF DAMAGING 
WINDS IN THE HAZARDOUS WEATHER OUTLOOK WITH ANY CONVECTIVE LINE 
ALONG THE COLD FRONT. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE NUMBERS 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD AND LOOK REASONABLE. WITH 
SOUTHEASTERLY WINDS EXPECTED TODAY AND ESPECIALLY ON SUNDAY...WILL 
PLAN TO RAISE TEMPS WELL ABOVE GUIDANCE IN THE CENTRAL AND NORTHERN 
VALLEYS TO ACCOUNT FOR THE EXPECTED ADIABATIC FOEHN WARMING. 


.LONG TERM...(MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROUGH WILL SLOWLY 
DEAMPLIFY BY MID WEEK. SERIES OF WEAK SHORT WAVES EMBEDDED WITHIN 
FLOW OF UPPER LONG WAVE TROUGH WILL KEEP THINGS UNSETTLED FOR MONDAY 
AND MOST OF TUESDAY HOWEVER. TEMPS WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR CHANGE 
OVER TO SNOW BY MONDAY NIGHT. NO SIGNIFICANT ACCUMULATION EXPECTED 
AT THIS TIME HOWEVER. MID WEEK LOOKING GENERALLY TRANQUIL AS UPPER 
FLOW BECOMES NEARLY ZONAL. NEXT SYSTEM APPROACHES BY LATE WEEK. STILL 
CONSIDERABLE UNCERTAINTY WITH THIS EVENT HOWEVER AS TIMING REMAINS 
QUITE VARIABLE AMONG MODELS. THUS HAVE NOT MADE ANY MAJOR 
CHANGES TO PRECEDING GRIDS/FORECAST OTHER THAN TO BUMP UP POPS 
SLIGHTLY THURSDAY NIGHT FROM SLIGHT CHANCE TO LOW CHANCE. FOR 
TEMPS...DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV/MEX GUIDANCE AS NO CLEAR TREND 
WAS NOTED IN ENSEMBLE DATA.

245 PM EST FRI JAN 22 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY)...UPPER TROUGH ACROSS THE 
CENTRAL APPALACHIANS IS MOVING EAST. WEAK SURFACE HIGH WILL BUILD 
INTO THE AREA REMAINDER OF TODAY THEN QUICKY MOVE EAST OF THE 
APPALACHIANS EARLY SATURDAY MORNING. MODELS SHOW PLENTY OF LOW-LEVEL 
MOISTURE REMAINING OVER THE AREA THROUGH MID-MORNING SATURDAY JUST 
IN TIME FOR HIGH-MID LEVEL CLOUDS TO SPREAD INTO THE AREA.

ENOUGH SURFACE MOISTURE TONIGHT TO PRODUCE AREAS OF FOG. SOME OF THE 
FOG COULD BECOME LOCALLY DENSE. WILL ALSO ADD PATCHY DRIZZLE 
OVERNIGHT.

MAIN SYSTEM OF INTEREST IS A STRONG SHORT-WAFE MOVING OUT OF THE 
SOUTHERN PLAINS TOWARD THE GREAT LAKES FOR SATURDAY NIGHT AND 
SUNDAY. MODELS SHOW A FAIRLY GOOD TROPOPAUSE FOLD OVER THE PLAINS 
STATES WHICH HELPS IN QUICKLY STRENGTHENING A SURFACE LOW OVER THE 
PLAINS STATES-MIDWEST. THE TIGHT PRESSURE GRADIENT AROUND THIS 
SYSTEM AND RIDGING OVER THE EAST COAST PRODUCES A STRONG BOUNDARY 
LAYER JET SATURDAY NIGHT AND SUNDAY (SOUTHERLY 850MB JET OF 75KT+)

PLACEMENT OF JET FAVORS MOUNTAIN WAVE HIGH WINDS FOR THE MOUNTAINS 
AND THE ADJACENT FOOTHILLS. WILL ISSUE A HIGH WIND WATCH FOR 04Z-21Z 
SUNDAY. A LINE OF CONVECTION IS ANTICIPATED SUNDAY AS THE 
PRE-FRONTAL TROUGH MOVES THROUGH THE AREA. WILL CALL FOR WIDESPREAD 
SHOWERS AND CHANCE OF THUNDERSTORMS FOR THE WESTERN HALF OF THE 
FORECAST AREA. WILL NEED TO MONITOR CHANCE OF SEVERE SINCE THE 
SYSTEM WILL BE QUITE DYNAMIC...BUT INSTABILITY IS QUITE LIMITED AT 
BEST.

GENERALLY FOLLOWED GFS MOS NUMBERS THROUGH THE FORECAST PERIOD.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...UPPER TROF CONTINUES TO 
SHIFT ONLY SLOWLY EAST SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY AS AT LEAST 
THREE SHORTER WAVELENGTH SYSTEMS WITH MODERATELY DEEP MOISTURE DROP 
SOUTHEAST AROUND THE AMPLIFIED TROF. TEMPERATURES SHOULD BE WARM 
ENOUGH THAT ANY PRECIP WILL BE IN THE FORM OF RAIN FOR 
SUNDAY/MONDAY. MONDAY NIGHT INTO TUESDAY THICKNESSES WILL BE 
DROPPING IN THE NORTHWEST FLOW REGIME AND SNOW SHOWERS WILL BECOME 
MORE LIKELY AS THE PRECIP TYPE ESPECIALLY IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
HELD ONTO A SLIGHT CHANCE FOR SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS A PART OF 
SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA AND EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE TUESDAY EVENING. 
KEPT THE FORECAST DRY WEDNESDAY THROUGH THE DAYTIME PERIOD THURSDAY 
AS UPPER FLOW BECOMES ZONAL. MODELS ALL OVER THE PLACE LATE IN THE 
EXTENDED PERIOD WITH A FAIRLY HIGH DEGREE OF UNCERTAINTY SO USED 
PERSISTENCE METHOD FOR THURSDAY. FOR FRIDAY...USED A LOW CHANCE 
PROBABILITY IN ORDER TO GET A LITTLE CLOSER TO NEIGHBORING WFO'S 
THOUGHTS AT THIS REMOTE PERIOD OF THE FORECAST. TRENDED MAX/MIN 
TEMPERATURES CLOSE TO IF NOT A COUPLE DEGREES BELOW MEX MOS 
GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN 
AREA OF LOW PRESSURE CENTERED NEAR LOUISVILLE KY...WITH ITS 
ASSOCIATED OCCLUDED FRONT EXTENDING SOUTH ACROSS MIDDLE TN. THIS LOW 
AND ITS OCCLUDED FRONT WILL SLOWLY MOVE TOWARDS THE FORECAST AREA 
THIS MORNING...CREATING SOME ADDITIONAL SCATTERED SHOWERS THIS 
MORNING. THIS SYSTEM IS PROGGED TO GRADUALLY DISSIPATE BY THE 
AFTERNOON HOURS...WITH ITS ASSOCIATED RAIN ENDING. HOWEVER...CLOUD

PREVENTING ANY VERTICAL MIXING. AS FOR TEMPS...GFS AND NAM GUIDANCE 
NUMBERS REVEAL SOME LARGE DISCREPANCIES WITH MAXES TODAY...AND WILL 
GENERALLY TREND TOWARDS A COMPROMISE. GUIDANCE NUMBERS FOR TONIGHT 
ARE IN GOOD AGREEMENT AND LOOK REASONABLE. 


.LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...MAIN FOCUS FOR THE LONG 
TERM REVOLVES AROUND THE NEXT IN A SERIES OF SYSTEMS THAT APPROACHES 
IN THE LATE SATURDAY THROUGH EARLY SUNDAY TIME FRAME. FORECAST 
SOUNDINGS SUGGEST CONDITIONS FAVORABLE FOR POTENTIAL MOUNTAIN WAVE 
EVENT AS FRONT APPROACHES WITH STRONG SOUTHEASTERLY LOW-LEVEL FLOW
PERPENDICULAR TO MOUNTAIN AXIS ORIENTATION...VEERING WIND PROFILE
AND RELATIVELY STABLE BOUNDARY LAYER. WENT WITH CATEGORICAL POPS AS

UPDATE WILL BE SENT OUT A LITTLE EARLY FOR THE ISSUANCE OF A WIND
ADVISORY FOR THE TN MOUNTAINS AND SW NC FROM 15Z TO 00Z TOMORROW.
THE PRESSURE GRADIENT OVER THE MOUTAINS WILL BE TIGHTENING LATE
TONIGHT AS HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS ACROSS THE CAROLINAS AND LOW
PRESSURE APPROACHES FROM THE WEST. THE NAM SHOWS SOUTHEAST WINDS
AROUND 3 KFT BETWEEN 30 AND 40 KTS.

THE REST OF THE FORECAST LOOKS ON TRACK...WITH CATEGORICAL POPS AND
A MENTION OF ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. THE ELEVATED INSTABILITY IS
HIGHEST OVER MIDDLE TN AND DROPS OFF OVER THE PLATEAU...SO THUNDER
WILL BE DECREASING AS THE STORMS MOVE EAST. OVERNIGHT TEMPERATURES
SHOULD ONLY FALL SLIGHTLY FROM CURRENT VALUES DUE TO WEAK WARM
ADVECTION.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY)...LARGE AREA OF RAIN HAS
PUSHED EAST RATHER QUICKLY THROUGH THE REGION THIS AFTERNOON...
WITH BACK EDGE OF THIS RAIN LOCATED ACROSS EASTERN MOST PARTS OF
THE VALLEY COUNTIES...BUT LINGERING OVER ALL OF SWRN VA AT MID
AFTERNOON. EXPECT A BRIEF BREAK IN RAIN BEFORE AN UPSTREAM AREA OF
SCATTERED TO BROKEN CONVECTIVE PRECIPITATION MOVES IN BY EARLY
EVENING. LOWERED POPS BRIEFLY EARLY TONIGHT FOR THIS SCENARIO AND
ADDED SOME MENTION OF ISOLATED THUNDERSTORMS. KEPT POPS GENERALLY
IN THE LIKELY TO CATEGORICAL RANGE FOR OVERNIGHT PERIOD. TEMPS WILL
STAY ON THE MILD SIDE AND IN LINE WITH SIMILAR MOS MINS.

FOR THURSDAY AND THURSDAY NIGHT...THE UPPER AND SURFACE LOW TRACK 
EAST INTO WESTERN PARTS OF TN AND KY...WITH A PERIOD OF MODERATE TO 
LOCALLY HEAVY RAINS EXPECTED AT LEAST EARLY THURSDAY. NAM MODEL HAS 
BACKED OFF ON THE STRENGTH OF THE LOW LEVEL JET (MORE IN LINE WITH 
GFS DEPICTION OF AROUND 40 KNOTS OR SO)...SO I HELD OFF ON ISSUING A 
WIND ADVISORY FOR THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS AT THIS TIME. SPREAD TSRA 
OVER MORE OF THE FORECAST AREA INTO THURSDAY AFTERNOON...AS A LARGE 
AREA OF ELEVATED INSTABILITY MOVES EAST INTO THE REGION AS THE LOW 
TRACKS EAST ON THURSDAY. DECENT COVERAGE OF WRAP AROUND SHOWERS
INTO THURSDAY NIGHT.

NAM SEEMS TO HOLD ON TO MORE SHOWERS INTO FRIDAY...AND IS MUCH
COOLER THAN GFS FOR HIGHS. FOR NOW...I OPTED FOR A MOS BLEND ON
POPS WHICH KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS AND MORE IN LINE
WITH NEIGHBORS. SLIGHTLY UNDERCUT THE WARMER GFS MOS FOR HIGHS
...WHICH AGAIN BLENDED BETTER WITH ADJACENT FORECAST GRIDS.


.LONG TERM...(FRIDAY NIGHT THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE OVER THE 
AREA BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND SATURDAY.  A FRONT 
TRACKS THROUGH THE AREA FROM SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT. 
WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES FOR SUNDAY WHEN THE BEST DYNAMICS AND 
MOISTURE ARRIVES.  UPPER LOW FOLLOWS ON MONDAY...WILL KEEP THE

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...PLEASANT CONDITIONS EXPECTED 
TO SLOWLY DETERIORATE THROUGH THE FIRST PERIOD PER MODEL/SREF 
CONSENSUS. THERE ARE STILL SOME TIMING DIFFERENCES BETWEEN THE 
MODELS WITH GFS AT LEAST 6 HOURS FASTER THAN NAM AND SREF. TENDED TO 
FAVOR SLOWER CONSENSUS AND THUS SIGNIFICANTLY UNDERCUT MAV POPS IN 
THE FIRST PERIOD. CATEGORICAL POPS LOOK APPROPRIATE FOR THE SECOND 
PERIOD AS ALL MODELS DEPICT WIDESPREAD RAIN OVER THE AREA. IT DOES 
NOT APPEAR PRECIP WILL BE ESPECIALLY HEAVY WITH THIS FIRST ROUND 
HOWEVER WITH FORECAST QPFS GENERALLY NOT MORE THAN ABOUT 0.25 
INCHES. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV GUIDANCE.


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...
BY WEDNESDAY NIGHT A NEGATIVELY-TILTED 500 MB SHORTWAVE TROUGH 
AXIS WILL STRETCH FROM OK TO THE MS/AL COAST...AND THE NOSE OF THE 
UPPER JET WILL BE PUSHING INTO THE LOWER MS VALLEY WITH THE 
LEFT-EXIT REGION OVER AL/GA. THE DEVELOPMENT OF COLD AIR DAMMING 
EAST OF THE APPALACHIANS WILL RESULT IN AN EAST-WEST ORIENTED FRONT 
ACROSS NORTHERN GA...EXTENDING WEST ACROSS NORTHERN AL/MS TO THE 
SURFACE LOW OVER AR/WEST TN. THIS FRONT SHOULD BE THE FOCUS FOR 
CONVECTION ON THURSDAY. THE CONCERN FOR OUR AREA IS THAT THE 
EAST-WEST ORIENTATION OF CONVECTION TO OUR SOUTH WILL CUT OFF OUR 
SUPPLY OF DEEP MOISTURE...AND LATENT HEAT RELEASE FROM THIS 
CONVECTION WILL HELP MIDLEVEL STABILIZATION. WHILE CATEGORICAL POPS 
ARE STILL WARRANTED FOR WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND THURSDAY...OUR QPF WILL 
LIKELY BE LIMITED...ESPECIALLY IN NORTHERN SECTIONS. 

THE GFS SHOWS SOME DECENT SURFACE-BASED INSTABILITY MOVING INTO OUR 
AREA ON THURSDAY...BUT THE NAM'S DEPICTION OF KEEPING THE 
INSTABILITY TO OUR SOUTH LOOKS MORE REALISTIC. SOME WEAK ELEVATED 
INSTABILITY MAY BE POSSIBLE IN THE SOUTHERN SECTIONS...BUT WILL NOT 
MENTION ANY THUNDERSTORMS AT THIS TIME. THE UPPER TROUGH AXIS PUSHES 
TO OUR EAST THURSDAY NIGHT...AND ALL PRECIP SHOULD END BEFORE 12Z 
FRIDAY. THE PACIFIC ORIGIN OF THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM MEANS THAT 
COLD ADVECTION WILL BE MINIMAL AND TEMPS SHOULD REMAIN MILD ON 
FRIDAY...WITH HIGHS IN THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS.

A DEEP CLOSED LOW WILL SLOWLY TRACK FROM THE PLAINS TO THE GREAT 
LAKES FOR SATURDAY THROUGH MONDAY. THE ASSOCIATED COLD FRONT PUSHES 
THROUGH OUR AREA ON SUNDAY...AND THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT AMONG THE 
MODELS ON THIS PATTERN AND THE TIMING. WILL HAVE LIKELY POPS ON 
SUNDAY AS A RESULT OF THE GOOD MODEL CONSENSUS. WITH THE GFS SHOWING 
A 150+ KT UPPER JET PUSHING INTO THE AREA...DYNAMICS LOOK QUITE 
STRONG WITH THIS SYSTEM. ADD A 70+ KT LLJ AND 850 MB THETA-E VALUES 
NEAR 320K...AND THUNDERSTORMS LOOK LIKE A POSSIBILITY...IF NOT SOME 
SEVERE STORMS. WILL MENTION A CHANCE OF THUNDER IN THE 
CLIMATOLOGICALLY-FAVORED SOUTHERN SECTIONS. A HIGH WIND EVENT WITH 
MOUNTAIN WAVES ALSO APPEARS LIKELY SATURDAY NIGHT/SUNDAY. 

THE UPPER JET AND DRY SLOT MOVE OVER SUNDAY NIGHT...LOWERING POPS TO 
A CHANCE OR SLIGHT CHANCE. A SECOND SHORTWAVE EMBEDDED WITHIN A DEEP 
UPPER TROUGH WILL KEEP A CHANCE TO SLIGHT CHANCE POP GOING THROUGH 
MONDAY NIGHT...MAINLY IN NORTHERN SECTIONS. COLD ADVECTION AND AN 
UPSLOPE LOW LEVEL FLOW MAY BRING A TRANSITION TO SNOW MONDAY NIGHT 
IN THE NORTH AND THE MOUNTAINS.

.DISCUSSION...
CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A QUASI-STATIONARY FRONTAL BOUNDARY 
OVER THE OHIO RIVER VALLEY...WITH HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED ALONG THE 
GULF COASTAL REGION. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS SOME HIGH CLOUDS OVER 
THE MS RIVER VALLEY IN ASSOCIATION WITH AN UPPER-LEVEL SHORT WAVE. 
THIS SHORT WAVE WILL CONTINUE TO MOVE EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY TONIGHT...WITH CLOUDS INCREASING OVER THE FORECAST AREA. 
THESE HIGH CLOUDS SHOULD KEEP ANY POSSIBLE FOG DEVELOPMENT TONIGHT 
FROM BECOMING TOO EXTENSIVE...BUT WITH TEMPS FALLING TO THE 
DEWPOINTS AND A SATURATED GROUND STILL IN PLACE...WILL PLAN TO 
MENTION SOME PATCHY FOG AFTER MIDNIGHT. 

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST THIS EVENING TO ADD A 
MENTION OF PATCHY FOG...AND TO TWEAK TEMPS A LITTLE ACCORDING TO THE 
LATEST TRENDS.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND TUESDAY)...GENERALLY TRANQUIL CONDITIONS 
EXPECTED THROUGH THE SHORT TERM AS SURFACE HIGH PRESSURE CONTINUES 
TO BUILD INTO THE REGION AND FLOW ALOFT REMAINS NEARLY ZONAL. MINOR 
SHORT WAVE TROUGH PROJECTED TO TRANSLATE THROUGH THE REGION 
TONIGHT...BUT ONLY AN INCREASE IN MID-LEVEL CLOUDS IS EXPECTED WITH
THIS FEATURE. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY DID NOT DEVIATE MUCH FROM MAV
GUIDANCE VALUES.


.LONG TERM...(TUESDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY)...
MIDLEVEL ISENTROPIC LIFT WILL BRING INCREASING CLOUDS AND A CHANCE 
OF RAIN LATE TUESDAY NIGHT. THE DEPTH OF THE LIFT AND MOISTURE WILL 
BE INCREASING THROUGH WEDNESDAY AS LOW PRESSURE STRENGTHENS OVER THE 
PLAINS...AND WILL BRING THE POPS UP TO LIKELY. HOWEVER THE QPF 
SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT AS THE LIFT REMAINS WEAK...MAINLY ASSOCIATED 
WITH ISENTROPIC LIFT. THE BEST LIFT WILL BE LATE WEDNESDAY NIGHT AND 
THURSDAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF A NEGATIVELY-TILTED SHORTWAVE TROUGH IN 
THE MID AND UPPER LEVELS...ALONG WITH GOOD UPPER DIVERGENCE ABOVE A 
50 KT 850 MB JET. OVERALL...MODELS APPEAR TO BE IN PRETTY GOOD 
AGREEMENT...SO WILL GO WITH CATEGORICAL POPS ON THURSDAY. THE 
SOUTHEASTERLY LLJ DEPICTED IN THE GFS GETS UP TO 50 KTS AT 850 
MB...SO THERE COULD BE SOME ADVISORY-LEVEL WINDS IN THE MOUNTAINS ON 
THURSDAY. PRECIP SHOULD END BEFORE 12Z FRIDAY WITH THE PASSAGE OF 
THE SURFACE COLD FRONT AND 850 MB TROUGH AXIS. 

MILD TEMPS SHOULD CONTINUE INTO FRIDAY AS THERE IS LITTLE IN THE WAY 
OF COLD ADVECTION BEHIND THE DEPARTING LOW. AN UPPER RIDGE WILL 
PROVIDE DRY WEATHER WITH ABOVE NORMAL TEMPERATURES THROUGH SATURDAY. 
A DEEP CLOSED LOW WILL BE TRACKING EAST ACROSS THE NORTHERN PLAINS 
TO THE GREAT LAKES SATURDAY NIGHT THROUGH MONDAY. GFS AND ECMWF 
AGREE ON THE FROPA ON SUNDAY. THE WARM ADVECTION AND LLJ LOOK QUITE 
STRONG AHEAD OF THE FRONT. THUNDERSTORMS COULD BE POSSIBLE WITH SUCH 
A PATTERN...BUT WILL NOT MENTION THIS YET AS IT IS STILL A LONG WAY 
OUT TO FORECAST AGAINST CLIMATOLOGY.

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM CENTERED ALONG 
THE MID ATLANTIC COAST...WITH A TROUGH EXTENDING SOUTHWEST OF IT 
ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS OF THE APPALACHIANS. AREA RADARS REVEAL 
SOME LIGHT RAIN LINGERING OVER THE MOUNTAINS IN ASSOCIATION WITH 
THIS TROUGH...BUT THIS RAIN SHOULD CONTINUE TO SLOWLY MOVE EAST AND 
EXIT THE FORECAST AREA LATER THIS EVENING. SATELLITE IMAGERY REVEALS 
THE BACK EDGE OF THE CLOUDS OVER MIDDLE TN...BUT THESE CLOUDS APPEAR 
TO NOT BE MAKING MUCH PROGRESS TO THE EAST THIS EVENING. A MID LEVEL 
INVERSION IS PROGGED TO LINGER OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT... 
WHICH SHOULD ALSO SLOW ANY EROSION OF THESE CLOUDS ACROSS THE 
FORECAST AREA OVERNIGHT. ALTHOUGH SOME CLEARING MAY DEVELOP ACROSS 
THE WESTERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA BEFORE SUNRISE...THINK THAT 
THIS CLEARING WILL ENCOURAGE FOG DEVELOPMENT OVERNIGHT. THUS...WILL 
PLAN TO MENTION MOSTLY CLOUDY SKIES OVERNIGHT WITH AREAS OF FOG DUE 
TO THE SATURATED AIR MASS. 

OVERALL...WILL PLAN TO UPDATE THE FORECAST LATER THIS EVENING TO 
REMOVE MENTION OF RAIN...TO ADD A MENTION OF FOG...AND TO TWEAK

235 PM EST SAT JAN 16 2010

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND SUNDAY)...STILL QUITE A BIT OF 
UNCERTAINTY ON WHERE LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL TRACK...AS GFS 
CONTINUES TO SHOW A TRACK TO OUR SOUTHEAST AND NAM HAS IT FURTHER 
NORTHWEST. LITTLE DOUBT THAT ENTIRE AREA WILL SEE SIGNIFICANT RAIN 
TONIGHT INTO SUNDAY...SO WILL GO WITH CAT POPS.  GFS NOT SHOWING AS 
MUCH COOLING ALOFT AS EARLIER RUNS FOR SUN AFTERNOON...BUT STILL 
SOME RISK THAT THERE WILL BE A CHANGEOVER TO SNOW OVER THE VERY 
HIGHEST PEAKS OF THE MOUNTAINS SUN AFTERNOON...BUT DOWNPLAY THIS 
POTENTIAL FOR NOW GIVEN WARMER DEPICTION IN OTHER MODELS AND SYSTEM 
TRACK UNCERTAINTY.  OTHER CONCERNS ARE POTENTIAL FOR FLOODING AND 
HIGH WINDS.  DOES NOT LOOK NEARLY AS IMPRESSIVE AS SOME OF OUR 
EARLIER WIND EVENTS...BUT EVEN USING A NAM/GFS BLEND LOOKS LIKE 
THERE COULD BE A FAIRLY BRIEF PERIOD WHERE MOUNTAIN WAVES COULD 
AFFECT THE NORMALLY FAVORED SPOTS...AND THE MODEL 850 WINDS DO 
APPROACH 50 KTS.  SO WILL UPGRADE WATCH TO A HIGH WIND WARNING BUT 
NARROW TIME WINDOW DOWN A BIT.  FLOODING POTENTIAL DOES NOT LOOK 
STRONG ENOUGH FOR A WATCH...SO WILL JUST CONTINUE THE SPS WHERE SNOW 
MELT MAY AUGMENT RUNOFF.


.LONG TERM...(SUNDAY NIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY)...SYSTEM PULLS OUT OF THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION SUNDAY NIGHT WITH UPPER FLOW BECOMING 
NEARLY ZONAL. DRY CONDITIONS RETURN FOR THE EARLY PORTION OF THE 
WORK WEEK BEFORE MORE UNSETTLED WEATHER APPROACHES BY MID WEEK AS 
PATTERN REMAINS PROGRESSIVE. GENERAL DISAGREEMENT AMONG MODELS AND 
ENSEMBLES CONTINUE TO LEAD TO QUITE A BIT OF UNCERTAINTY FOR MID 
WEEK. AS SUCH...DID NOT MAKE ANY PROFOUND CHANGES TO PRECEDING 
GRIDS/FORECAST. LATE LONG TERM PERIOD APPEARS DRY AT THIS TIME. GFS 
AND SOME OF ITS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS PROJECT ANOTHER SYSTEM APPROACHING 
NEXT WEEKEND. KEPT THINGS DRY FOR NOW GIVEN THE TIMING UNCERTAINTIES 
AND MODEL DIFFERENCES HOWEVER.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...ATMOSPHERE CONTINUES TO SLOWLY 
TRANSITION FROM FRIGID CONTINENTAL NORTHWEST FLOW TO MILDER 
SOUTHWEST MARITIME FLOW AS A SHORTWAVE SHIFTS NORTHEAST ACROSS THE 
LOWER MISSISSIPPI VALLEY. ALTHOUGH THERE WILL BE AN INCREASE IN HIGH 
LEVEL MOISTURE TODAY THERE SHOULD BE SUFFICIENT SUNSHINE TO KEEP 
SKIES MOSTLY SUNNY. THE WARMING TREND WILL CONTINUE WITH 
TEMPERATURES APPROXIMATELY 5 TO 10 DEGREES WARMER. UNDERCUT WARMEST 
GUIDANCE AGAIN TODAY WITH GREATEST DEVIATION ACROSS SOUTHWEST 
VIRGINIA/EXTREME NORTHEAST TENNESSEE WHERE SNOW COVER STILL IN 
PLACE. ALSO UNDERCUT WARMER MIN TEMPS A LITTLE BIT TONIGHT AS 
RADIATION SHOULD OCCUR TO SOME DEGREE DESPITE INCREASE IN HIGH 
CLOUDS.  

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL 
BEGIN TO TAKE SHAPE OVER THE NORTHWESTERN GULF OF MEXICO ON 
FRIDAY...AND AFFECT OUR AREA OVER THE WEEKEND. A HIGH PRESSURE RIDGE 
OVER THE AREA ON FRIDAY WILL PROVIDE MILD TEMPERATURES...WITH HIGHS 
IN THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS. CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING FRIDAY NIGHT AS 
THE LOW TRACKS TOWARD THE NORTHEAST...ADVECTING GULF MOISTURE TOWARD 
THE AREA. THE GFS BRINGS IN RAIN A BIT FASTER THAN OTHER 
MODELS...BUT OVERALL THERE IS GOOD AGREEMENT THAT MOST OF THE RAIN 
WILL COME SATURDAY NIGHT. A DRY LAYER IN THE LOW LEVELS WILL LIKELY 
DELAY THE ONSET OF RAIN...AND WILL LOWER POPS TO JUST A SLIGHT 
CHANCE SATURDAY AFTERNOON. 

THE SOUTHERN STREAM LOW MERGES WITH A NORTHERN STREAM TROUGH OVER 
THE APPALACHIANS...WHICH ENHANCES QG FORCING SATURDAY NIGHT. GOOD 
AGREEMENT AMONG THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS AND THE ECMWF GIVES 
CONFIDENCE TO BOOST POPS TO CATEGORICAL AT THAT TIME. TEMPERATURES 
PROFILES INDICATE ABOVE-FREEZING TEMPS UP TO 800 MB THROUGH 
SUNDAY...SO THE BULK OF THE PRECIP WILL BE RAIN. COLD ADVECTION 
BEHIND THE DEPARTING LOW COULD LEAD TO A BRIEF CHANGE TO SNOW IN 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS SUNDAY NIGHT...BUT DRY AIR QUICKLY FOLLOWS TO SHUT 
OFF ANY PRECIP. 

A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM DEVELOPING OVER THE PLAINS MAY AFFECT THE AREA 
ON WEDNESDAY. WILL KEEP THE CHANCE POPS GOING...BUT THERE IS QUITE A 
BIT OF SPREAD IN THE ENSEMBLES...SO CONFIDENCE IS LOW.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A RIDGE OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL SLIDE EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA
WHILE SURFACE HIGH DOMINATES ACROSS MUCH OF THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S.
THROUGH THE PERIOD. THE UPPER FLOW WILL SLOWLY TURN MORE WESTERLY
AND DRY ADVECTION WILL LEAD TO QUITE A BIT OF SUNSHINE. THERE MAY
BE SOME LINGERING CLOUDS ACROSS SOUTHWEST VIRGINIA THIS MORNING BUT
THESE SHOULD DISSIPATE ALLOWING FOR NEARLY FULL SUNSHINE ACROSS THE
REGION. THE INSOLATION SHOULD BOOST TEMPERATURES ABOVE 40 DEGREES
FOR THE FIRST TIME IN SEVERAL DAYS. A CLEAR COLD NIGHT IS IN STORE
AGAIN TONIGHT AS THE SURFACE RADIATES IN THE BONE DRY AIRMASS. WENT
BELOW GUIDANCE TEMPS TODAY AS COLD SURFACE WILL NEED A LITTLE
LONGER PERIOD OF RADIATION TO REALIZE FULL WARMING. ALSO ADJUSTED
MINS BELOW GUIDANCE TONIGHT IN DRY LIGHT WIND ENVIRONMENT.

.LONG TERM (THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...
THURSDAY AND FRIDAY WILL FEATURE A UPPER RIDGE MOVING ACROSS THE 
AREA...WHICH WILL PROVIDE MUCH WARMER TEMPERATURES THAN WE HAVE SEEN 
FOR SOME TIME. UNDER MOSTLY SUNNY SKIES BOTH DAYS...HIGHS SHOULD 
REACH INTO THE 50S IN MOST SPOTS...AND PERHAPS APPROACH 60 ON FRIDAY 
IN THE SOUTHERN VALLEY AS SLIGHT WARM ADVECTION SETS IN. 

CLOUDS WILL BE INCREASING FRIDAY NIGHT AS THE RIDGE MOVES AWAY AND 
LOW PRESSURE DEVELOPS OVER THE NW GULF OF MEXICO. ISENTROPIC LIFT 
AND MOISTURE ADVECTION AHEAD OF THIS SYSTEM WILL BEGIN TO SPREAD 
PRECIP OUR WAY ON SATURDAY...MAINLY IN THE AFTERNOON. THE 
ECMWF...THE OPERATIONAL GFS...AND THE GFS ENSEMBLE MEMBERS ARE IN 
PRETTY GOOD AGREEMENT WITH THE TIMING OF THIS SYSTEM...BRINGING THE 
BEST LIFT SATURDAY NIGHT AS THE CLOSED LOW PASSES DIRECTLY OVER THE 
AREA. WILL RAISE POPS TO LIKELY AT THAT TIME. MOISTURE WRAPPING 
AROUND THE BACK OF THE DEPARTING LOW WILL KEEP PRECIP GOING INTO 
SUNDAY. THE ENTIRE EVENT LOOKS TO BE RAIN AS THE GFS TEMPERATURE 
PROFILES ARE WELL ABOVE FREEZING EVERYWHERE...THOUGH THERE COULD BE 
A BRIEF CHANGE TO SNOW IN HIGHER ELEVATIONS SUNDAY NIGHT BEFORE THE 
DRY AIR ALOFT MOVES IN TO END PRECIP. MIDLEVEL RIDGING BUILDS IN

.SHORT TERM (TODAY THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT)...
WITH THE PASSAGE OF A SHORTWAVE TROUGH EARLY THIS MORNING...THE 
MOISTURE SOURCE OF THE GREAT LAKES HAS OPENED UP ONCE 
AGAIN...BRINGING OVERCAST CLOUDS AND LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS TO THE AREA. 
WHILE LARGE-SCALE LIFT WILL REMAIN WEAK BEHIND THE TROUGH...AN 
UPSLOPE WIND COMPONENT AND STEEP LOW LEVEL LAPSE RATES WILL KEEP 
SNOW SHOWERS GOING THROUGH THE MORNING. THE CURRENT FOREACAST LOOKS 
ON TRACK AND WILL NOT MAKE SIGNIFICANT CHANGES TO QPF OR POPS. WHILE 
AMOUNTS SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT...LESS THAN ONE INCH...WILL KEEP THE 
ADVISORY GOING DUE TO THE POTENTIAL IMPACT OF SLICK ROADS THIS 
MORNING. 

THE DEPTH OF MOISTURE BEGINS TO DECREASE IN THE AFTERNOON AS LOW 
LEVEL WINDS OVER THE LOWER GREAT LAKES AND OHIO VALLEY BACK IN 
RESPONSE TO A BUILDING RIDGE. THIS SHOULD CUT OFF OUR MOISTURE 
SOURCE...ENDING ANY PRECIP AND DECREASING CLOUD COVER. SKIES WILL 
GRADUALLY CLEAR TONIGHT AS THE RIDGE BUILDS OVER OUR AREA. 

RIDGING OVER THE REGION SHOULD BRING THE WARMEST TEMPERATURES WE 
HAVE SEEN YET THIS YEAR...AND END THE STREAK OF SUB-FREEZING 
TEMPERATURES IN MANY PLACES. UNDER SUNNY SKIES...TEMPERATURES SHOULD 
REACH INTO THE 40S ON WEDENSDAY IN MOST SPOTS...AND APPROACH THE 50S 
ON THURSDAY. THE GFS MOS CONTINUES TO BE EVEN WARMER...BUT WILL 
UNDERCUT IT BY A FEW DEGREES DUE TO ITS RECENT WARM BIAS.

.LONG TERM (FRIDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...
GFS/ECMWF NOT TOO DISSIMILAR ESPECIALLY EARLY IN THE PERIOD BUT
DEVIATE A BIT SUNDAY AND MONDAY AS GFS UPPER TAKES A TRACK EAST OF
THE APPALACHIANS AND EXITS FAIRLY QUICKLY COMPARED TO THE ECMWF.
STAYED CLOSER TO THE ECMWF FOR THE LATER PORTION OF THE EXTENDED
FORECAST. UPPER LOW LIFTS NORTHEAST OUT OF NORTHERN MEXICO ON
FRIDAY TO SOUTH TEXAS AS SURFACE LOW BUILDS TOWARD THE LOUISIANA
COAST. REMOVED POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND TRIMMED BACK A BIT FOR
SATURDAY AS MODELS A LITTLE SLOWER WITH SYNOPTIC FEATURES.
ISENTROPIC LIFT INCREASES DURING THE DAY SATURDAY BUT THE MAIN
EVENT FOR THE ENTIRE FORECAST AREA MAY HOLD OFF UNTIL SATURDAY
NIGHT SO WENT WITH HIGHEST POPS HERE AS SURFACE LOW MOVES ACROSS
MIDDLE/EASTERN TENNESSEE AT THIS TIME. FAVORED GOOD CHANCE TO
LIKELY POPS SOUTH AND EAST WITH MEDIUM CHANCE ELSEWHERE.
POSSIBILITY OF MIXED PRECIP ON SATURDAY FROM SOUTHWEST TO NORTHEAST
AS COLD DRY AIR WILL HAVE TO BE OVERCOME ACROSS MUCH OF THE
FORECAST AREA. USED A RAIN/SNOW MIX FOR SATURDAY NIGHT INTO SUNDAY
AS MAIN UPPER SYSTEM GRADUALLY SHIFTS EAST WITH LOWERING
PROBABILITIES. OF COURSE...ECMWF TRACK WOULD MEAN LESS CHANCE OF
FROZEN PRECIP WITH MORE WARM AIR ADVECTION. ECMWF HINTS AT
POSSIBILITY OF WEAK TRAILING NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE ENERGY
SUNDAY NIGHT INTO MONDAY SO HELD ONTO SMALL/SLIGHT CHANCE POPS WITH
RAIN/SNOW MIX. TRENDED TEMP FORECAST TOWARD NEW MEX MOS GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A SHORTWAVE TROUGH WILL BE APPROACHING THE AREA FROM THE NORTHWEST 
TODAY...BRINGING INCREASING HIGH AND MIDLEVEL CLOUDS. LIFT IS NOT 
STRONG WITH THIS SYSTEM...BUT SOME UPPER DIVERGENCE IN THE NOSE OF 
THE UPPER JET AND SOME QG FORCING SHOULD GENERATE SOME PRECIP BY 
LATE AFTERNOON IN THE NORTH. MOST PRECIP SHOULD HOLD OFF UNTIL THE 
LOWER LAYERS MOISTEN AFTER 00Z. RAISED POPS TO LIKELY IN THE NORTH 
AND THE MOUNTAINS...TAPERING TO JUST A SLIGHT CHANCE SOUTH. THE LACK 
OF STRONG LIFT AND THE FAST MOVEMENT OF THE SYSTEM SHOULD KEEP SNOW 
AMOUNTS LOW...LESS THAN 2 INCHES IN SW VA AND THE TN MOUNTAINS. WILL 
ISSUE AN SPS FOR THIS.  

.LONG TERM (TUESDAY THROUGH SUNDAY)...A WEAK SHORTWAVE EXITS THE CWA 
ON TUESDAY BRINGING SNOWSHOWERS TO THE AREA EARLY.  WILL KEEP LOW  
CHANCE POPS FOR TUESDAY WITH THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH WHERE 
THE DEEPEST MOISTURE IS AVAILABLE.  HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING 
DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY.  ANOTHER DISTURBANCE MOVES 
INTO THE REGION ON FRIDAY NIGHT AND LINGERS INTO THE WEEKEND. WILL 
KEEP SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR FRIDAY NIGHT AND CHANCE POPS FOR BOTH 
SATURDAY AND SUNDAY. SHOULD SEE BOTH RAIN AND SNOW FRIDAY NIGHT WITH 
THE BEST CHANCE OF SNOW ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS.  RAIN/SNOW IS 
EXPECTED DURING THE NIGHTTIME AND EARLY MORNING HOURS ON BOTH

.AVIATION...
A NORTHERLY FLOW WILL TRANSPORT MOISTURE FROM THE GREAT LAKES
REGION TO EAST TENNESSEE TODAY. THE MAJORITY OF THE TAF PERIOD
LOOKS TO BE VFR...THOUGH CIGS COULD LOWER TO MVFR AT AT TRI FOR A
FEW HOURS THIS MORNING AS LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS MOVE ACROSS THE AREA.
DECREASING MOISTURE TONIGHT SHOULD LEAD TO CLEAR SKIES AT CHA AND
TYS...BUT EXPECT TRI TO KEEP A BROKEN VFR CEILING THROUGH THE
PERIOD.

.SHORT TERM (TODAY AND TONIGHT)...
A DEEP POSITIVELY-TILTED UPPER TROUGH WILL BE OVER THE AREA TODAY 
AND TONIGHT...PROVIDING CONTINUED COLD TEMPERATURES AND SNOW SHOWERS 
OR FLURRIES OVER THE NEXT 24 HOURS. OUR MOISTURE SOURCE IN THE 
NORTHERLY LOW LEVEL FLOW WILL BE THE GREAT LAKES...AND WILL SUSTAIN 
A THIN LAYER OF MOISTURE AROUND 900 MB TODAY. HOWEVER LIFT IS VERY 
WEAK...AND THE NORTHERLY FLOW IS NOT CONDUCIVE TO OROGRAPHIC LIFT. 
SO MOST OF THE AREA WILL SEE JUST FLURRIES TODAY...WITH NO 
MEASURABLE ACCUMULATION. THE MOUNTAINS AND SW VA MAY SEE A FEW 
TENTHS OF SNOW...BUT WILL END THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY. WITH 
TEMPS CURRENTLY IN THE SINGLE DIGITS AND WINDS AROUND 10 MPH THIS 
MORNING...WILL KEEP THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY GOING. THOUGH WE MAY SEE 
SOME OCCASIONAL SUN THIS MORNING...WE SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLOUDY 
OVERALL...AND LEANED TOWARD THE COLDER NAM MOS FOR TEMPS. 

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...HIGH PRESSURE BUILDS IN 
BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR SUNDAY AND MONDAY.  A WEAK SHORTWAVE TRACKS 
THROUGH THE NORTHERN PORTIONS OF THE CWA ON MONDAY NIGHT AND 
TUESDAY.  WILL KEEP LOW CHANCE POPS FOR BOTH PERIODS WITH THE 
HIGHEST CHANCES IN THE NORTH WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE IS 
AVAILABLE.  HIGH PRESSURE RETURNS BRINGING DRY WEATHER FOR WEDNESDAY 
AND THURSDAY.  ANOTHER DISTURBANCE MOVES INTO THE REGION ON 
FRIDAY.  WITH STILL SOME UNCERTAINTY ON TIMING...WILL KEEP ONLY 
SLIGHT CHANCE POPS FOR NOW. A WARMING TREND IS EXPECTED DURING THE 
LATTER HALF OF THE PERIOD. STAYED NEAR HPC/MEX FOR TEMPERATURES.

305 PM EST FRI JAN 8 2010

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SUNDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS A LARGE DOME OF ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER 
THE NORTHERN PLAINS...WITH ITS VERY COLD AND DRY AIR MASS EXTENDING 
OVER THE FORECAST AREA. THIS AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
DOMINATE THE EASTERN HALF OF THE NATION THROUGH THE WEEKEND...WITH 
COLD AND DRY CONDITIONS CONTINUING OVER THE REGION. AREA RADARS 
CURRENTLY REVEAL MINIMAL SNOW SHOWER ACTIVITY OVER THE FORECAST 
AREA...BUT MODELS INDICATE THAT SNOW SHOWERS SHOULD INCREASE IN 
COVERAGE TONIGHT AS AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH AXIS OVER THE MID WEST 
NEARS THE FORECAST AREA. THIS UPPER TROUGH AXIS WILL SWING ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA ON SATURDAY...SO WILL KEEP A MENTION OF SCATTERED 
SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS MAINLY THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA 
INCLUDING THE SMOKY MOUNTAINS. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS INDICATE 
ONLY A SHALLOW LAYER OF MOISTURE WITH THIS UPPER TROUGH...WITH STEEP 
LAPSE RATES CONFINED TO A SHALLOW BOUNDARY LAYER BELOW 850 MB. 
THUS...EXPECT ONLY LIGHT SNOWFALL ACCUMULATIONS ACROSS THE HIGHER 
ELEVATIONS WITH THE RESULTING UPSLOPE FLOW...MAINLY DUE TO THE COLD 
GROUND TEMPS AND A HIGH LIQUID TO SNOW RATIO CREATING EXCELLENT 
CONDITIONS FOR ACCUMULATIONS. WITH ALL OF THIS MIND...WILL CONTINUE 
THE WINTER WX ADVISORIES FOR SOUTHWEST VA AND THE MOUNTAINS THROUGH 
TONIGHT...BUT WILL CANCEL THE ADVISORY FOR NORTHEAST TN WHERE 
ADDITIONAL ACCUMULATIONS SHOULD BE AROUND AN INCH OR LESS. BREEZY 
WINDS SHOULD CONTINUE ACROSS THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS TONIGHT...SO WILL 
CONTINUE THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY THROUGH TONIGHT AS WELL. AS FOR 
TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH THE 
PERIOD...BUT WILL CONTINUE TO UNDERCUT THEM AND FOLLOWING A 
PERSISTENCE FORECAST DUE TO SOME LINGERING SNOW COVER ACROSS THE 
AREA.

.LONG TERM (MONDAY THROUGH FRIDAY)...COLD...DRY ARCTIC HIGH PRESSURE 
IN PLACE OVER THE REGION WILL BE MODERATING ON MONDAY...WITH MOST 
VALLEY LOCATIONS SEEING TEMPERATURES REACH INTO THE 30S. THE WARMING 
TREND WILL CONTINUE ON TUESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES APPROACHING NEAR 
NORMAL VALUES. TEMPERATURES WILL BE NEAR SEASONAL LEVELS THROUGH THE 
REMAINDER OF THE EXTENDED. MODEL RUN CONSISTENCY QUITE POOR BY THE 
END OF THE EXTENDED. A WEAK AREA OF LOW PRESSURE IS PROGGED TO SLIDE 
ACROSS THE NORTH CWA ON TUESDAY. MOISTURE AND LIFT RATHER LIMITED 
AND WILL INTRODUCE ONLY LOW POPS FOR FAR NORTHERN LOCATIONS. HIGH 
PRESSURE RIDGING BUILDS IN FOR WEDNESDAY AND THURSDAY. AN 
APPROACHING SYSTEM COULD BEGIN TO AFFECT THE AREA FRIDAY. CONFIDENCE 
LOW ON TIMING AND POSITIONS OF SYSTEM BUT WILL BRING IN SOME LOW

ACROSS MOST OF THE AREA THIS MORNING. MOST AREAS MAY SEE SOME SUN 
THIS MORNING...MAINLY IN THE SOUTH. HAVE LOWERED POPS TO A CHANCE 
UNTIL 18Z. SURFACE OBS SHOW SNOW BEING REPORTED ACROSS IL AND 
IN...ASSOCIATED WITH THE TROPOPAUSE FOLD AND MIDLEVEL TROUGH. VERY 
COLD 500 MB TEMPS MOVE OVER THE AREA BY THE EVENING...AND THE 850 MB 
WINDS SHIFT TO A MORE NORTHERLY DIRECTION...WITH TRAJECTORIES OFF 
THE GREAT LAKES TO PROVIDE MOISTURE. WILL RAISE POPS BACK TO LIKELY 
IN THE NORTH THIS AFTERNOON. SYNOPTIC LIFT IS NOT VERY STRONG...SO 
QPF SHOULD REMAIN LIGHT...LESS THAN 2 INCHES OF SNOW WITH A 15:1 
RATIO (WHICH HAS BEEN CALCULATED AT OUR OFFICE). OF GREATER CONCERN 
THAN SNOW AMOUNTS WILL BE THE IMPACT OF ADDITIONAL SNOW ON TOP OF 
ALREADY-POOR ROAD CONDITIONS. WILL CONTINUE THE WINTER WEATHER 
ADVISORY FOR NE TN...SW VA...AND THE TN MOUNTAINS...AND REMOVE SW NC 
AS THE MORE NORTHERLY FLOW WILL BE LESS FAVORABLE FOR UPSLOPE THERE. 
THE ADVISORY MAY NEED TO BE EXTENDED INTO THE EVENING PERIOD TONIGHT

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH SATURDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE NEAR INDIANAPOLIS...WITH ITS 
TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING SOUTHWEST ACROSS MIDDLE TN. THIS COLD 
FRONT WILL QUICKLY MOVE EAST ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA LATE THIS 
AFTERNOON...AND SHOULD COMPLETELY EXIT THE AREA AFTER SUNSET. AREA 
RADARS CURRENTLY REVEAL SOME LIGHT SNOW OVER THE FORECAST AREA...BUT 
THE PEAK INTENSITY OF THIS SNOWFALL SHOULD OCCUR AROUND SUNSET. THE 
LATEST RUNS OF BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS INDICATE LESS MOISTURE 
WITH THIS COLD FRONT TONIGHT...AND WITH ITS ASSOCIATED UPPER-LEVEL 
TROUGH ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY. WITH COLD GROUND TEMPS AND A HIGH 
LIQUID TO SNOW RATIO EXPECTED...IT STILL APPEARS THAT A FEW INCHES 
OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY THIS EVENING. MODELS SEEM 
TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH LIGHT PRECIP AMOUNTS ASSOCIATED WITH 
THE UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH ON FRIDAY AND SATURDAY...AND REVEAL A SHALLOW 
LAYER OF MOISTURE WITH THE STEEP LAPSE RATES CONFINED TO BELOW 850 
MB. THUS...EXPECT ONLY LIGHT SNOWFALL AMOUNTS WITH THE UPSLOPE FLOW 
IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS. WITH ALL OF THIS MIND...WILL CONTINUE WITH 
THE WINTER WX ADVISORIES WITHOUT ANY CHANGES TO PREVIOUS THINKING. 
WINDS BEHIND THE FRONT ARE PROGGED TO BECOME BREEZY ACROSS THE 
HIGHER ELEVATIONS TONIGHT...WITH WIND CHILLS EXPECTED TO DROP BELOW 
THE WIND CHILL ADVISORY CRITERIA OF -5 DEGREES FOR SEVERAL HOURS 
AFTER MIDNIGHT. THUS...WILL ISSUE A WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR LATE 
TONIGHT INTO FRIDAY MORNING ACROSS THE MOUNTAINS. AS FOR TEMPS... 
GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT THROUGH THE PERIOD...BUT 
WILL UNDERCUT THEM DUE TO SOME SNOW COVER EXPECTED ACROSS THE AREA.

.LONG TERM (SUNDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...WITH DRY AND SUNNY 
CONDITIONS...THE ARCTIC AIR MASS IN PLACE OVER THE REGION WILL BEGIN 
TO SLOWLY MODERATE ON SUNDAY. BY MONDAY...MOST VALLEY LOCATIONS 
SHOULD SEE TEMPERATURES REACH ABOVE THE FREEZING MARK. THE WARMING 
TREND CONTINUES INTO TUESDAY WITH TEMPERATURES EXPECT TO BE NEAR 
NORMAL. SEASONAL TEMPERATURES CONTINUE THROUGH THE REST OF THE 
EXTENDED. MODELS IN POOR AGREEMENT WITH TRACK AND TIMING OF A WEAK 
SHORT WAVE MOVING THROUGH THE REGION AROUND THE WEDNESDAY/THURSDAY 
TIME FRAME. TREND HAS BEEN TO KEEP MOISTURE AND LIFT TO OUR SOUTH

CURRENT SURFACE ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF LOW PRESSURE ALONG THE 
ILLINOIS/INDIANA BORDER...WITH ITS TRAILING COLD FRONT EXTENDING 
SOUTHWEST ALONG THE MS RIVER VALLEY. THIS COLD FRONT WILL CONTINUE 
TO QUICKLY MOVE EAST ACROSS THE TN RIVER VALLEY THIS AFTERNOON...AND 
SHOULD MOVE ACROSS THE FORECAST AREA AROUND SUNSET. AREA RADARS 
REVEAL SOME LIGHT SNOW FLURRIES CURRENTLY MOVING INTO THE AREA... 
BUT WITH A VERY DRY AIR MASS IN PLACE...THINK THAT ANY ACCUMULATING 
SNOWFALL WILL DEVELOP LATER THIS AFTERNOON AS THE COLD FRONT 
APPROACHES. BOTH THE NAM AND GFS MODELS HAVE BACKED OFF SOME WITH 
THEIR FORECASTED PRECIP AMOUNTS WITH THIS FRONT...BUT BELIEVE THERE 
WILL BE A HIGH LIQUID TO SNOW RATIO WITH THIS FRONT. THUS...IT STILL 
APPEARS THAT A FEW INCHES OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE BY 
THIS EVENING...ESPECIALLY WITH COLD GROUND TEMPS FROM THE RECENT 
COLD SPELL.

240 PM EST WED JAN 6 2010

.SHORT TERM (TONIGHT THROUGH FRIDAY NIGHT)...CURRENT SURFACE 
ANALYSIS SHOWS AN AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE CENTERED OVER THE LOWER MS 
RIVER VALLEY...WITH A LEE TROUGH LOCATED ALONG THE EASTERN FOOTHILLS 
OF THE APPALACHIANS. THIS AREA OF HIGH PRESSURE WILL CONTINUE TO 
BUILD OVER THE FORECAST AREA TONIGHT...WITH A LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM 
PROGGED TO QUICKLY MOVE FROM THE PLAINS INTO THE MID MS RIVER 
VALLEY. THIS LOW PRESSURE SYSTEM WILL THEN MOVE INTO THE GREAT LAKES 
REGION ON THURSDAY...BRINGING A COLD FRONT ACROSS THE TN RIVER 
VALLEY AND ONTO THE CUMBERLAND PLATEAU BY SUNSET. SOUTHERLY WINDS 
AHEAD OF THIS COLD FRONT WILL BRING AN INCREASE IN MOISTURE ACROSS 
THE FORECAST AREA...ALONG WITH A BRIEF WARMING TREND. WITH TEMPS 
RISING INTO THE UPPER 30S ACROSS SOUTHEAST TN THURSDAY AFTERNOON... 
THERE MIGHT BE A BRIEF MIX OF RAIN AND SNOW...BUT FOR MOST OF THE 
FORECAST AREA IT WILL BE COLD ENOUGH FOR ALL SNOW. WITH COLD GROUND 
TEMPS FROM THE RECENT COLD SPELL...THINK THAT THIS SNOW WILL 
ACCUMULATE QUICKLY WITH A HIGH SNOW TO LIQUID RATIO DUE TO THE COLD 
AIR IN PLACE. MODELS SEEM TO BE IN GOOD AGREEMENT WITH EXPECTED 
PRECIP AMOUNTS...AND THUS...EXPECT ADVISORY-LEVEL ACCUMULATIONS DUE 
TO THE FAST MOVEMENT OF THIS COLD FRONT. THE PEAK OF THIS SNOWFALL 
WILL LIKELY OCCUR AROUND SUNSET...AND THEN QUICKLY EXIT THE AREA BY 
MIDNIGHT. AN UPPER-LEVEL TROUGH WILL THEN SWING ACROSS THE FORECAST 
AREA ON FRIDAY...PRODUCING SCATTERED SNOW SHOWERS ACROSS THE AREA... 
ESPECIALLY ACROSS THE NORTHERN HALF OF THE FORECAST AREA. AN 
ADDITIONAL INCH OF SNOW ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE POSSIBLE IN THE VALLEY 
AREAS ON FRIDAY...WITH UPSLOPE NORTHWESTERLY FLOW IN THE MOUNTAINS 
PRODUCING SEVERAL MORE INCHES. BY FRIDAY NIGHT...TOTAL SNOWFALL 
ACCUMULATIONS WILL LIKELY BE IN THE THREE TO SIX INCH RANGE ACROSS 
SOUTHWEST VA AND THE EAST TN MOUNTAINS...WITH LOCALLY HIGHER AMOUNTS 
POSSIBLE ON THE HIGHEST PEAKS. WITH AN AVERAGE OF SIX INCHES IN 24 
HOURS NEEDED FOR WARNING CRITERIA...WILL PLAN TO ISSUE AN ADVISORY 
AREAWIDE TO COVER THIS EVENT SINCE THIS WILL BE A LONG DURATION 
SNOWFALL. AS FOR TEMPS...GUIDANCE NUMBERS ARE IN GENERAL AGREEMENT 
THROUGH THURSDAY NIGHT AND LOOK REASONABLE. WILL TREND TOWARDS THE 
COOLER NAM NUMBERS ON FRIDAY AND FRIDAY NIGHT WITH SOME SNOW COVER 
EXPECTED ACROSS THE AREA.

.LONG TERM (SATURDAY THROUGH WEDNESDAY)...UPPER LEVEL TROF CONTINUES 
TO BUILD SOUTHEAST ACROSS THE SOUTHEASTERN U.S. SATURDAY INTO SUNDAY 
WHICH WILL KEEP A NORTHERLY FLOW IN PLACE THROUGHOUT THE WEEKEND. 
THIS WILL ALLOW ARCTIC AIR TO SPILL SOUTH INTO THE FORECAST AREA 
KEEPING MAX/MIN TEMPS WELL BELOW NORMAL. SUFFICIENT MOISTURE AND 
OROGRAPHIC LIFT ON A LENGTHY PERIOD OF NORTHWESTERLY FLOW WILL KEEP 
SNOW SHOWERS GOING ON SATURDAY WITH EMPHASIS IN THE HIGHER TERRAIN. 
THE OROGRAPHIC SNOW WILL TAPER OFF LATER SATURDAY NIGHT. UPPER LEVEL 
HEIGHTS WILL GRADUALLY BUILD LATER SUNDAY THROUGH TUESDAY WITH DRY 
ADVECTION ALLOWING FOR A RETURN TO SOME SUNSHINE AND SLOWLY 
MODIFYING TEMPERATURES. MODELS HAVE SOME TIMING ISSUES WITH THE 
ECMWF A LITTLE SLOWER THAN THE GFS DEPICTION FOR ANOTHER STORM 
SYSTEM ON WEDNESDAY. MODELS HINT AT A POSSIBLE SOUTHERN STREAM SHORT 
WAVE WEDNESDAY INTO THURSDAY. FOR NOW WILL KEEP POP AT SLIGHT CHANCE 
FOR SNOW AND/OR RAIN SHOWERS DUE TO UNCERTAINTY AT THIS TIME RANGE.

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...BRIEF RESPITE IN COLD TEMP REGIME 
EXPECTED IN THE SHORT TERM AS STRONG NORTHWESTERLY FLOW RELAXES AND 
WEAK UPPER RIDGING BUILDS INTO THE SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION. 
ALTHOUGH SOME TEMP MODERATION IS EXPECTED TODAY...HAVE CONTINUED TO 
UNDERCUT MAV GUIDANCE SOMEWHAT AS TEMPS WILL HAVE A LONG WAY TO 
RECOVER FROM THIS MORNING'S VERY COLD TEMPS. CONTINUED ISOLATED SNOW 
SHOWER ACTIVITY FOR HIGHER TERRAIN OF NORTHEASTERN ZONES FOR THE 
FIRST PORTION OF THE FIRST PERIOD AS LOW-LEVEL MOISTURE IS PROJECTED 
TO LINGER THERE LONGER.

.LONG TERM...(THURSDAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...CERTAINLY THE MOST 
INTERESTING AND SIGNIFICANT PERIODS ARE LATE THURSDAY INTO FRIDAY. 
TEMPERATURE PROFILE INDICATES ALL SNOW...WITH A LITTLE MORE 
PRECIPITABLE WATER TO WORK WITH INITIALLY INTO THURSDAY NIGHT...
BEFORE THE ARCTIC AIR SURGES SOUTHWARD AGAIN ON FRIDAY. AVAILABLE 
MOISTURE FOR SNOW DROPS FROM AROUND 4/10THS OF AN INCH EARLY TO 
AROUND 1/10 TO 2/10THS BY 12Z FRIDAY. THIS...PLUS THE FAST MOVEMENT 
OF THE SYSTEM...SHOULD WORK TO LIMIT SNOW AMOUNTS MOSTLY INTO THE 
ADVISORY CRITERIA RANGE. WINTER WEATHER DESK PROGS...AS WELL AS 
SHORT RANGE MODELS SNOW AMOUNTS...ALSO AGREE WITH THIS BEING MAINLY 
AN ADVISORY EVENT. SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES WILL LINGER WELL INTO 
SATURDAY...BUT THE SHALLOWNESS OF MOISTURE IN THE ARCTIC AIRMASS 
WILL PUT US BACK TO THE DRY FLUFFY SNOW WE HAVE HAD FOR THE PAST FEW 
DAYS (WHICH DOES NOT ACCUMULATE IN SIGNIFICANT AMOUNTS). 

AFTER SOME GREAT COORDINATION WITH NEIGHBORING NWS OFFICES...FEEL 
MORE CONFIDENT IN UPDATING OUR SPECIAL WEATHER STATEMENT (SPS) THAN
ISSUING A WINTER STORM WATCH FOR LATE 3RD PERIOD INTO EARLY 4TH 
PERIOD. I DID RAISE POPS SLIGHTLY IN THE FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS 
FRIDAY TO LOW END OF LIKELY...AND ADJUSTED SNOW AMOUNT GRID UP 
SLIGHTLY FOR 06-12Z FRIDAY.

ARCTIC SURFACE HIGH GRADUALLY SHIFTS EAST AND UPPER RIDGE BUILDS 
EAST TO BRING ABOUT SOME DRY WEATHER AND MORE SEASONAL TEMPS EARLY 
NEXT WEEK. HOWEVER...UNTIL THIS OCCURS...I PREFERRED TO UNDERCUT MOS 
FOR ESPECIALLY HIGH TEMPS EACH DAY...WHICH KEPT OUR GRIDS MORE 
CONSISTENT WITH ADJACENT OFFICES.

UPSTREAM. MODELS ALSO INDICATE DECREASING MOISTURE DEPTH...SO DO
NOT EXPECT MUCH SNOW ACCUMULATION. THE CURRENT FORECAST OF

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT AND WEDNESDAY)...A SHORTWAVE TRACKING THROUGH 
THE REGION BRINGING LIGHT SNOW TO THE NORTHERN AREAS AND THE SMOKY 
MOUNTAINS TONIGHT.  WILL KEEP THE HIGHEST CHANCES IN THOSE AREAS FOR 
TONIGHT.  COULD SEE ANOTHER 1-2 INCHES IN THE HIGHER ELEVATIONS...SO 
WILL KEEP THE WINTER WEATHER ADVISORY GOING INTO THE EARLY EVENING 
HOURS.  THE BREEZY CONDITIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS COMBINED WITH THE 
COLD TEMPERATURES WILL RESULT COLD WIND CHILLS...WILL LEAVE THE 
CURRENT WIND CHILL ADVISORY GOING FOR TONIGHT.  THE SHORTWAVE SHOULD 
SHOULD EXIT THE AREA BY WEDNESDAY MORNING SO WILL KEEP WEDNESDAY 
AFTERNOON DRY FOR NOW.  TEMPERATURE GUIDANCE IS RELATIVELY CLOSE FOR 
TONIGHT...SO DIDN'T STRAY TOO FAR.  TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW NORMAL 
AGAIN.  FOR TOMORROW...STAYED A BIT COOLER THAN THE MAV NUMBERS FOR 
WEDNESDAY...BUT STILL BELOW NORMAL TEMPERATURES EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY NIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT 
AGREEMENT FOR MUCH OF THE LONG TERM...WITH EASTERN TROUGH AND COLD 
PATTERN PERSISTING THROUGH THE WEEKEND.  UPPER LOW DROPPING 
SOUTHEAST OUT OF THE NORTHERN PLAINS WILL BRING A SURFACE 
TROUGH/COLD FRONT THROUGH OUR AREA SOMETIME IN THE THU/EARLY 
THURSDAY NIGHT TIME FRAME. MODELS STILL HAVE SOME DISAGREEMENT ON 
EXACT TIMING...BUT LOOKS LIKE WE WILL SEE A BAND OF SNOW MOVING 
ACROSS THE AREA...WITH MOST LIKELY TIMING THU LATE MORNING INTO 
EARLY THU EVENING.  BEST FORCING SHOULD OCCUR OVER A FAIRLY BRIEF 
PERIOD...SO THINK ACCUMULATIONS WILL BE ON THE LIGHT SIDE...BUT AT 
THIS TIME A GENERAL 1 TO 3 INCH TYPE SNOWFALL LOOKS POSSIBLE BY LATE 
THU NIGHT.  SINCE WARNING CRITERIA SNOW LOOKS UNLIKELY AT LEAST FOR 
MOST OF THE AREA AT THIS TIME...WILL NOT ISSUE A WATCH...BUT WILL 
ISSUE AN SPS OUTLOOK.  SNOW SHOWERS WILL LINGER ESPECIALLY HIGHER 
TERRAIN INTO SATURDAY OR SATURDAY NIGHT...THEN SHOULD BE DRY SUNDAY.
LOW CONFIDENCE FOR THE EARLY WEEK PERIOD...AS MODEL AGREEMENT AND 
CONTINUITY POOR.  FOR NOW WILL SIDE WITH THE GFS AND KEEP THINGS DRY 
BOTH MONDAY AND TUESDAY.  MAIN ADJUSTMENTS TO GFS MOS TEMPS WILL BE 
TO  GO LOWER ON SOME HIGH TEMPS...INCLUDING THU.

DRY AS I HAVE SEEN...LYING ON ROADS AND GRASSY AREAS...BUT LITTLE IF 
ANY WATER EQUIVALENT TO STICK MUCH. CONSIDERING THIS...FEEL THAT ANY 
SNOW ACCUMS IN THE ADVISORY AREAS WILL BE LIGHT AND GENERALLY IN 
LINE WITH CURRENT FORECAST GRIDS.

WILL ACCEPT THAT LINGERING SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES OVER SW VA AND 
EXTREME NE TN TONIGHT WON'T REALLY AMOUNT TO MUCH...AND NOT EXTEND 
OUR WINTER WEATHER (MISERABLE WEATHER) ADVISORY BEYOND TODAY. DID 
DECIDE TO ISSUE ANOTHER WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR THIS EVENING AND 
OVERNIGHT FOR THE SMOKY AND NRN MTNS OF EAST TN.

OTHERWISE...UNDERCUTTING GFS MOS FOR MAX TEMPS LOOKS GOOD FOR YET 
ANOTHER DAY...AS WE STRUGGLE TO SEE LITTLE IF ANY SPOTS WARM TO 32 
DEGREES OR BETTER. CLOUD COVERED AREAS HAVE NOT DROPPED QUITE AS 
MUCH AS MOS HAS SUGGESTED FOR MINS...SO I MADE A FEW TWEAKS TO MIN 
TEMPS FOR TONIGHT. 


.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...LONG WAVE TROUGH AND 
NEGATIVE HEIGHT ANOMALIES WILL PERSIST OVER THE EASTERN CONUS 
THROUGH THE LONG TERM PER MODEL AND ENSEMBLE CONSENSUS. ANOTHER 
VIGOROUS SHORT WAVE AND SURFACE COLD FRONT WILL APPROACH THE 
SOUTHERN APPALACHIAN REGION ON THURSDAY. TEMPS WILL CONTINUE TO BE 
COLD ENOUGH TO SUPPORT AN ALL SNOW EVENT BUT MODELS INDICATE THIS
SYSTEM WILL PROGRESS THROUGH AREA QUITE RAPIDLY WHICH SHOULD LIMIT
SNOWFALL POTENTIAL. SNOW EXPECTED TO TAPER TO SNOW SHOWERS BY
THURSDAY NIGHT. ANOTHER NORTHERN STREAM SHORT WAVE SWINGS THROUGH
THE AREA ON SATURDAY BUT MODELS DEPICT MOISTURE TO BE LIMITED WITH
THIS FEATURE. AMPLITUDE OF LONG WAVE TROUGH RELAXES BY LATE IN THE
LONG TERM PERIOD SUGGESTING MODEST TEMPERATURE MODERATION.
NEVERTHELESS...HEIGHTS STILL PROJECTED TO BE LOWER THAN CLIMO AND
THUS TEMPS EXPECTED TO REMAIN BELOW CLIMO. FOR TEMPS...GENERALLY
TENDED TO CONTINUE TO UNDERCUT MAV/MEX GUIDANCE.

.SHORT TERM...(TONIGHT THROUGH TUESDAY NIGHT)...SHORTWAVE TRACKING 
THROUGH THE REGION BRINGING SNOW TO THE AREA. SNOW INTENSITY SHOULD 
INCREASE TONIGHT AS THE DISTURBANCE APPROACHES.  WILL KEEP THE 
HIGHEST CHANCES IN NORTH AND MOUNTAINS WHERE THE DEEPEST MOISTURE IS 
AVAILABLE FOR TONIGHT AND TUESDAY.  WILL SEE THE HIGHEST SNOW 
ACCUMULATIONS IN THE MOUNTAINS...WILL KEEP THE CURRENT WINTER 
WEATHER ADVISORY GOING AS IS.  ANOTHER COLD NIGHT EXPECTED FOR 
TONIGHT ALONG WITH BREEZY WINDS.  WILL KEEP THE CURRENT WIND 
CHILL ADVISORY GOING FOR THE MOUNTAINS AS WELL.  STAYED BELOW THE 
MAV GUIDANCE WITH THE COLD AIR AND SNOW EXPECTED.

.LONG TERM...(WEDNESDAY THROUGH MONDAY)...MODELS IN DECENT AGREEMENT 
IN OVERALL PATTERN FOR THE LONG TERM PERIOD...WITH PERSISTENT 
TROUGHING IN THE EAST KEEPING A COLD PATTERN IN PLACE.  
HOWEVER...THERE ARE DIFFERENCES IN THE DETAILS.  GFS IS FASTER THAN 
THE 12Z NAM AND 00Z ECMWF WITH THE DIGGING UPPER LOW AND ASSOCIATED 
REINFORCING COLD FRONT THAT ARE FORECAST TO AFFECT THE AREA THURSDAY 
INTO FRIDAY.  THINK A COMPROMISE IS IN ORDER...SO WILL CARRY CHANCE 
POPS EXCEPT LIKELY PLATEAU COUNTIES FOR THU...THEN LIKELY NORTH AND 
CHANCE SOUTH FOR THU NIGHT.  DEEPER MOISTURE SHOULD BE DEPARTING 
FRIDAY...SO WILL BACK OFF TO SLIGHT CHANCE CENTRAL AND SOUTHERN 
VALLEY AREAS...WITH CHANCE MOST OTHER AREAS.  SHOULD ALL BE 
SNOW...AND RIGHT NOW STILL LOOKS LIKE MOST AREAS WILL SEE AT LEAST 
SOME LIGHT ACCUMULATION. HOWEVER...STILL TOO MUCH UNCERTAINTY AND 
TOO EARLY FOR ANY WATCHES OR ADVISORIES.  SHOULD HAVE SOME LINGERING 
SNOW SHOWERS/FLURRIES INTO THE WEEKEND...AND WILL GO DRY ON MONDAY

.SHORT TERM...(TODAY THROUGH TUESDAY)...BUSY SHIFT SO WILL KEEP AFD 
SHORT. MODELS TRENDING A LITTLE DEEPER ON MOISTURE TONIGHT INTO 
TUESDAY...WITH SOME LOW LEVEL UPSLOPE COMPONENT TO WINDS...PLUS ONE 
OR TWO VORTICITY MAXES/SPEED MAXES TO CLIP SW VA AND NE TN.

THIS ARCTIC AIRMASS IS VERY COLD AND DRIER THAN A TYPICAL WINTER 
AIRMASS...SO WE EXPECT A DRY/FLUFFY SNOW WITH A REALLY HIGH SNOW TO 
LIQUID RATIO...THUS COULD SEE SOME ADVISORY SNOW AMOUNTS MET BY 
TUESDAY MORNING (OR EARLIER?). GOOD COORDINATION WITH NEIGHBORING 
NWS OFFICES ON INCREASING POPS TONIGHT INTO TUESDAY FOR THE FAVORED 
AREAS. OPTED TO ISSUE A WINTER WX ADVISORY FOR SW VA/NE TN/SMOKIES
...PLUS YET ANOTHER WIND CHILL ADVISORY FOR OUR NRN AND SMOKY MTNS 
ALSO FOR TONIGHT THRU NOON TUESDAY. 

OTHERWISE...SOME STRAY SNOW FLURRIES AROUND THIS MORNING...BUT THE 
MOISTURE LOOKS QUITE SHALLOW FOR MUCH MORE THAN FLURRIES UNTIL 
TONIGHT. GFS MOS MAX TEMPS LOOK WELL OUT OF REACH GIVEN PERSISTENCE

TEMPS WILL STAY STEADY OR FALL TODAY. POPS REMOVED SINCE UPSTREAM 
MOISTURE LIMITED. A FEW FLURRIES POSSIBLE. SON

PREVIOUS DISCUSSION:

SHORT TERM...(TODAY AND TONIGHT)...COLD AIR ADVECTION IS LAGGING A 
BIT THIS MORNING...WITH SURFACE TEMPS APPARENTLY STILL ABOVE LOWER 
30S ACROSS MOST OF THE REGION...EVEN AS MILD AS LOWER 40S IN MANY 
SPOTS (SE TN/CENTRAL VALLEY/SW NC). WEAK RADAR RETURNS LIKELY SOME 
LIGHT RAIN...WITH PATCHY DRIZZLE PERSONALLY NOTED ON DRIVE TO WORK 
EARLIER. W TO NW SURFACE WINDS HAVE HELPED TO DISSIPATE AREAS OF FOG 
AND ALSO ALLOWED FOR CLOUD HEIGHTS TO SLIGHTLY IMPROVE FOR TAF SITES.

MOISTURE BECOMES INCREASINGLY SHALLOW BY MID TO LATE MORNING...WITH 
SUFFICIENT COLD AIR ALOFT ARRIVING TO SWITCH PRECIPITATION TYPE TO 
LIGHT SNOW SHOWERS OR FLURRIES FOR LATER TODAY. HOWEVER...TOP OF THE
LINGERING MOISTURE LAYER DOES NOT APPEAR TO BE COLD ENOUGH TO 
SUPPORT SNOW GROWTH TODAY. KEPT CONTINUITY WITH PREVIOUS GRIDS FOR 
TODAY...WITH LOW POPS IN OUR HIGHER ELEVATION AREAS OF NRN PLATEAU/ 
SW VA/NE TN/SMOKIES. 

POTENTIAL UPPER AIR DISTURBANCE SEEMS TO BE PROGGED FOR TONIGHT... 
WITH A BRIEF RESURGENCE IN LOW LEVEL MOISTURE FOR SW VA AND NE TN. 
HOWEVER...NOT A STRONG NW FLOW UPSLOPE SCENARIO INDICATED...SO I 
BACKED OFF POPS A BIT AND LOWERED SNOW AMOUNTS IN FAVORED AREAS TO 
ONLY AROUND ONE INCH OR SO. 

OTHERWISE...MOS TEMPS LOOKED REASONABLE AND FOLLOWED IN GENERAL...
ALTHO HOURLY TEMPS TODAY WILL NOT FOLLOW A TYPICAL PATTERN...AS 
MAXES MAY OCCUR EARLY.

LONG TERM...(SATURDAY THROUGH THURSDAY)...NORTHWEST FLOW PATTERN 
CONTINUES SATURDAY WITH COLD AIR COMING SOUTHEAST OUT OF CANADA. 
UPPER LOW OVER PA MOVES NE OFF THE NE COAST BY SATURDAY NIGHT. WILL 
CONTINUE CHANCE OF SNOW SHOWERS IN SW VA AND FAVORED UPSLOPE AREAS 
OF SMOKIES AND NE TN MOUNTAINS. TEMPERATURES WILL BE BELOW NORMAL 
MID 20S TO MID 30S. SATURDAY NIGHT SHOULD BE MOSTLY CLEAR TO PARTLY 
CLOUDY AND MUCH COLDER IN THE TEENS EXCEPT SINGLE DIGITS SW VA AND

COLD. MONDAY AND TUESDAY KEPT FORECAST UNCHANGED. COLD UPPER LOW OFF 
NE COAST BRINGS SPOKES OF ENERGY AROUND THE BACKSIDE WITH ENOUGH 
MOISTURE FOR MORE SNOW SHOWERS NE TN AND SW VA. THE PERSISTENT LOW 
FINALLY MOVES AWAY AND HIGH PRESSURE BRINGS ANOTHER COLD DRY DAY TO 
THE TN VALLEY AND SOUTHERN APPALACHIANS. A MORE SIGNIFICANT SOUTHERN 
SYSTEM BEGINS TO DEVELOP OVER TX WEDNESDAY WITH ADDITIONAL 
DEVELOPMENT IN THE GULF WEDNESDAY NIGHT OVER THE GULF. THURSDAY
